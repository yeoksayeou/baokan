<h3>九·印度之寺院與建築（上）</h3>
<p>印度藝術之於世界文化史上，放一異彩，素爲人所習知，良以印度爲佛敎之發祥地，而佛敎藝術則獨樹一幟者也。印度藝術中之最爲恢奇壯麗者，則莫若建築，舉世無有其匹。筆者於印度建築爲一門外漢，而今就讀書所得，撮要言之，以附於專輯之驥尾者，非自敢冒昧，亦拋磚引玉之意云爾。</p>
<p>亡人區域之人古建築</p>
<p>印度文化，一般認爲印度亞利安人所創作，山來已久，即建築藝術，亦若未能例外，蓋以印度亞利安人以前之歷史，茫無所考，實不得不然也。然依時代之推移，科學之發展，於最近十餘年間，印度文化史，賴考古學家之努力，竟爲之提早至印度亞利安人前千數百年之久，此後之展開，尙未有所限量，是則世界各國之文化史家，其於印度之觀點，或將興起一大轉變歟。</p>
<p>印度設有考古局，局長爲馬夏爾，（Sir．Iohn　Marshall）從事於印度各地古蹟之發掘，成績斐然，十年前左右，於莫恒菊大陸，掘得一古城廢墟，乃爲五千年前之遺蹟，更爲驚人之舉。其對於學術界之貢獻，至爲鉅大。莫恒菊大陸（Mo-Henjo-daro）木義為「亡人區域，」（Placeof　Dcad）原爲幾堆荒烟蔓草之土饅頭而已，其高處則有佛廢墟一座。其地誠如命名所示，久無人跡，然其四周曠野，泥土中最多碎磚，乃引起考古家之注意，而向佛塔下掘，竟獲得空前之發現也。所發現者，乃爲銅石器兼用時代之城市，其中最爲重要日關於建築者，則爲蓄水池，爲溝渠，爲井戶，爲浴室，爲市街等，至若古印，古陶，古飾，亦屬不少，均可證實其爲五千年前之物也。茲僅就建築言之。</p>
<p>蓄水池乃以火鍊之磚塊砌成，長三十九英尺，闊二十三英尺，作長方形，營造於巨大建築物之中央。水池四周，設有平臺。平臺四周本有拱　，全部圍於牆壁之內。至水池本身建築，極見匠心，砌磚塊時，已知應用石膏瀝靑，更堪側目。池壁且加以打磨，使其光亮。池床磚塊之排列，亦極整齊。池之南北兩端，設有巨大階級各一，所以引向池中也。池床向西北漸作傾斜，所以引水流入一巨大之溝渠也，至水之如何引入，蓄水池之作用在，今均尙未能判然，</p>
<p>溝渠之制，亦最値注意，其第一部分，長人可以直立無礙，溝上本蓋以木板，溝床則以磚砌。其另一端頂上，則開有穴孔，以便通溜人經常進出，作淸理工作。其後溝形逐漸低狹，而進入於一曲折之通路。市街中溝洫甚多，均相平行，或作二溝，或三溝不等，而均引入於總水溝中者也。高處之水，則應用泥製水管，以疏通之。井戶有私家自設者，亦有公共者，則設於市街之一角，或其邊緣之外，井邊舖有磚塊，幷通溝渠，其形極似中國之井戶。浴室建築亦佳，類似磚砌小井，環之以壁。</p>
<p>亡人區域之主要市街均由南而北，作並行綫，小弄小巷，則作於市街之右角，如是則房屋均座落於一方之中，其市街計劃，蓋如今日最摩登之美國都市也，斯亦可驚矣。</p>
<p>走廊，花園之制，則並無發見，庭院亦甚小。房屋類爲二層，分設階梯，足見一宅中居住兩家。此城市中，人口必極衆多，且社會組織，亦必良好，是可斷言也。</p>
<p>證以亡人區域之遺跡，印度亞利安人稱其先住民族爲黑炭」者，豈知其文明竞遠勝於自大之勝利者—印度亞利安人耶。當史美爾式夕印章發見時，瓦台爾（L．A．Waddell）已稱印度文化起源於史美爾（Sumer）矣，今亡人區域之發掘，則更使印度文化爲印度亞利安人所創之說，發生動搖，自屬亳無疑義。</p>
<p>佛敎建築略述</p>
<p>世人最爲感激之印度建築，乃爲佛敎建築，蓋不僅為藝術之眩惑，並亦具宗敎之意味者也。然釋尊在世時所創之建築物，則今已無遺留，所存之佛敎建築類爲後代所建，例如釋尊成道地迦耶之大廟，乃爲十四世紀時緬甸僧人所重建，一八八四年印度政府大加修理者也，其高一百六十英尺，相距七里之遙，即能望見云。今存遺跡中最古者，則推阿育王之石柱與松溪塔等。</p>
<p>阿育王石柱，係屬紀元前二百五十年左右之遺物，爲一圓柱，其頂作鐘形，周圍刻以運　狀之花紋，其上更坐一獅子。柱身刻有阿育王之誥文，全高三十二英尺九英寸半，基　之直徑爲三十五英寸牛，頂部直徑爲二十六英寸父四分之一，其意匠，樣式，手法，均出自印度所固有。獅子姿態，雄健堅實，亦足以窺見古印度藝術之魄力偉大。類此圓柱之紀念石柱，尙有三處，今不盡述。</p>

<h3>從生活指數中顯示出　生活問題的嚴重　較五年前增加了十八倍人力車顯已列入奢侈品</h3>
<p>年來上海生活程度的高漲，曠古未聞；全市居民，除了富戶之外，莫不歎求溫飽的不易，　般靠低薪過活的小市民，日處愁城；做老闆的　起來總是薪給已較從前增加幾倍，大有「待你不薄」，只怪你自己不會節儉之槪，實際上薪給的增加和物價的騰貴，兩相比較，不啻龜兎競走，無論如何休想趕得上。小市民好比啞吧呑黃連，有苦說不出，連自己的妻兒都難養活，沒奈何把合家老小疏散還鄕（假使故鄕還有老家）自己留滬苦混，即使讓故鄕的親友鄰居嘲笑你在「遍地黃金」的上海混了多年，反而狼狽回去，也顧不得這些了。</p>
<p>生活新指數又突創高峯</p>
<p>上海生活費用的趨高，大約是自大前年舊曆年底開始，漫無止境，最近幾個月來，局勢驟變，物價漲勢的劇烈，更是駭人聽聞，以迄今日，迫得小市民們難以苟延喘息，即使薪給極迅速地調整，也還不足應付。關於這點，從工部局統計處發表的數字，一望即知。本月二十四日的工部局公報所載本年三月份上海華籍工人生活費用的新指數，達一七八一。六〇的新高峯，這是以一九三六年的生活指數定為　〇〇而計算的，較諸　月份又增百分之三〇·六七，可見目前的生活指數，已較一九三六年約增十八倍，其現在一元幣的價値，僅等於一九三六年價値的五·六一分。西僑薪水階級的生活指數是七九一·四六，較諸二月份的七八二·九五，也增百分之二四·〇八，其一元幣値的百分之　〇·二九。（按工部局發表的西僑薪給指數，現也以　九三六年為比較　礎）</p>
<p>袋裏百元錢祇剩五元半</p>
<p>簡而言之，這些數字可表示你在六年前口袋裏有　百塊錢，現在祇剩五元半，其餘的九十四元半，已隨物價的昂貴而損失於無形，以外僑言，則有九十元已無形中損失了。然而，這還是照三月份的情形而論，假使照今日的物價新高峯來計算，至少又較三月份的指數漲起百分之三十。茲再將生活指數，詳細分析於後。</p>
<p>先拿華籍工人來說，平均每個家庭單位有五·〇二人，佔四·四　個消耗單位；家庭收入的比數是主要賺薪人佔六六·二〇，家中其餘諸人佔　三·二九，其他家庭進益佔一〇·五一；假使整個家庭在一九三六年收入一〇〇元，現在祇獲四〇五元，最少的祇有三四三元。以此數安，和支出表相對照，可見這家庭單位現在賴以生活的物品，僅及六年前的五分之一，假使這家庭現在的生活標準要和從前一般，必須月入約一·八〇〇元才行，可是目下平均實際所獲的祇三七三元，怎能不捉襟見肘呢。</p>
<p>生活支出的最大一項是「食，」仰光米每石售二二三·四六四元。（現在已售二九〇元）這在一九三六年。祗售九·七三五元；况且二二三·四六四元一石的米，質地還極低劣，自由市塲上的米價，約倍於此數，其次是「住，」現在的房租，巳六倍於一九三六年，業主所得無幾，大半都落入二房東之手，他們唯利是圖，對於禁止加租的規例，陽奉陰違一再藉口加租，罔顧制定法律者的仁慈用心，「房主不應壓迫貧困」這句社會良言，早被破壞得蕩然無存了，他如電燈費，在市政當局管理之下，支出數具尙少；衣服較一九三六年漲十五倍，燃料約漲二十到四十倍，</p>
<p>外僑的生活也顯得困頓</p>
<p>至於外僑生活指數。可列簡表如下：（根據一九三六年約平均指數為一〇〇以比較）</p>
<p>三月份的食物較一九三六年增加的比率為美僑十一倍，英僑十三倍，俄僑十六倍。他國僑民十四·五倍；房租美僑六又三分之一倍，英僑六又五分之一倍。俄僑六又三分之二倍，他國僑民五又三分之二倍；衣服美僑十一又三分之一倍，英僑十一·五倍，俄僑十一倍，他國僑民十一·五倍，雜項美僑五又三分之二倍，英僑五又四分之一倍，俄僑六倍，他國僑民六又三分之一倍。綜觀上列數字，房租和雜兩項，蛟衣食兩項的支出數低，房租是受一部份統制的，但租金的大部份，還是二房東所得。雜項包括公共汽車，電車和電話等費，也受市政當局的嚴格統制。至少人力車，在今日顯巳列入奢侈品，不計在內。</p>
<p>中等生活費須二千餘元</p>
<p>以上所載數字，都以工部局發表的為根據。茲再分析中等階級中外市民的生活開支；</p>
<p>華人家庭，以十人計，一九四二年三月</p>
<p>食　一五〇〇元</p>
<p>住　三〇〇元</p>
<p>衣　三〇〇元</p>
<p>雜項　二〇〇元</p>
<p>娛樂　二〇〇元</p>
<p>共計二五〇〇元</p>
<p>（四月份或較此數增百分之三十）</p>
<p>外僑家庭，以五人計，一九四二年三月</p>
<p>食　一二〇○元</p>
<p>住　六〇〇元</p>
<p>衣　一二〇〇元</p>
<p>雜項　六〇〇元</p>
<p>娛樂　四〇〇元</p>
<p>共計四〇〇〇元</p>
<p>（四月份或較此數增百分之三十）</p>
<p>生活指數在往昔除硏究此道者外，幾乎沒有人加以注意，因為那時候生活安定，指數上落很微，看來絕少興趣；可是在今日，事關切身生活，一般市民對於生活指數，都會仔細查閱一番，所以本文統計連篇也許還能引起　讀的興趣。不過，殷富人家，囤貨投機得法，游資愈積愈厚，生活騰貴，不受影響，無論生活指數如何遞增，似乎與他們無關；祗苦了絕大多數的小民，旣沒資本，又乏囊助，祗得讓生活的負担，愈壓愈重，抵當不了，而自尋短見的，和不耐凍　，倒斃路畔的，比比皆是，小民無罪　似乎不應受這樣殘酷的待遇吧！</p>

<h3>赫湛加醫師主辦麻瘋病人收容所　終身痼疾與外間相隔絕自給自足儼然另一世界</h3>
<p>滬郊人跡罕至之處、有麻瘋病人收容所在焉、收容所圍以竹籬、內居麻瘋病者百人、最長者年已六旬、幼者不足十二齡、雖生活安寗、然身患惡疾、其痛苦有非他人所能體會者、殊堪憐憫也、抑滬市麻瘋病人、不僅此數、另有四自人、亦患此毒症、因在初期、尙不足為社會之患、街頭熙攘往來之人叢中、常見彼等踪跡、</p>
<p>麻瘋現象</p>
<p>本文所記之麻瘋病人收容所、位於白利南路五角塲相近之兩路之間、所容病人之患病程度、深淺不一、有兩目失明者、有半身麻本者、有臂腿不全者、有十指已失者、皆不幸患麻瘋病使然、患者不願遺羞於人、故謂其遺傳致病、多矢口否認、</p>
<p>患者百萬</p>
<p>考麻瘋病見於中國、巳歷數千百載、冀·晉·豫·等省絕少發見、其他若干地區則不乏患者、其比數竟佔人口百分之一、舉世馳名之美國麻瘋病權威赫湛加醫師（Dr.　Lee　SHuiyenga）估計、中國有麻瘋病人逾百萬人、</p>
<p>聽天由命白利南路之麻瘋病收容所即赫醫師所設、蓋草屋多椽、供患病之男婦老幼暫為容身、此輩可憐虫絕少治愈之望、良以今日之科學、雖日昌明、惜尙未能圓滿解決此問題也、此症係皮膚痼疾、起潰瘍斑點、纖維死木、遂呈鱗狀、僥倖獲治者、寥寥無幾、所內諸患者、明知此身無望、然仍在此外界人士不敢貿然而入之隱僻所在、辛勤工作、烹飪裁衣等家務、莫不自行操作、對於外界演變、混然不知、蓋已聽天由命、不復抱出外之奢望矣、</p>
<p>脫離戰綫</p>
<p>二十六年滬戰之前、若輩原居滬市附近之麻瘋病院中、該院規模宏大、為中國所稀有、設備新頴、種種便利、莫不俱備、惜巳毀於砲火、如欲修葺、所費殊巨、院中病人倉惶逸來滬市、當時日越危險區、冒彈雨以食物送予病人者、即赫醫師也、當局深知赫醫師珍視院中病人之福利、甚於己生、且曾派軍官參觀、明瞭病人之需要照顧、故獨許其通過軍事綫、</p>
<p>倉皇來滬</p>
<p>戰事日緊、病人實有移居之絕對必要、赫醫生且接當局之最後通知、規定病人移居日期、苟延不運行、則後果不堪設想、院之左右、已落砲彈、病婦且遇危險、赫醫師亟撥貌最駭人之病人兩名、駐守院口、足使任何人望而却步、一面力謀解決、卒向工部局當局發緊急呼籲、請許病人通過公共租界、局方許之、惟以病人送入市區時、須與居民隔離為條件、</p>
<p>危途經歷</p>
<p>事旣決、赫醫生遂率諸病人穿越公共租界、沿途則有士兵與陸戰隊持槍上刺刀、夾道戒備、是行約歷一哩、縱病勢極危者、亦無車可乘、致沿途恒有病人不支、傾跌道旁者、不得不負之而行、當時院中尙有兩老者、並非麻瘋病人、寗留院同亡、然病人不忍見其獨留、終携之同赴安全地點、病人之目的地為極司非爾區、旣抵共地、自蓋竹籬茅舍、暫時棲身、至今仍居其中、拯助彼等之赫醫生、始終不離左右、為謀福利之增進、</p>
<p>宗敎信仰</p>
<p>所內病人、均係基督敎之忠實信徒、對於宗敎信仰深摯異常、另蓋一舍作為敎堂、戶上置十字架、講道者乃年巳五十三之病人、所內財務、亦歸其主司、襄助赫醫師調度預算、頗獲推重、男子從事木工製鞋與紡織、婦女負担女紅與洗滌等淸潔工作、童子則由年長病人授以普通學校之功課、蓋病人中不乏會受敎育、且能操英語者也、</p>
<p>自給自足</p>
<p>病人所製木器　衣履等、皆經充分消毒、始携市出售、購者固不必以傳染為慮、售物所得、一部份撥充收容所維持費、餘歸病人所得、隨意使用、所內亦有一病人經營糕餅糖菓之類、售予所內同病相憐諸人、惟目下情况惡化、巳無法繼續經營矣、所內講道牧師來自華南某敎堂、甫於數年前授職、不幸患此惡症、自知巳無痊愈之望、遂以此生予同所諸人以宗敎上之援手、敎堂亦有歌詠團、因經費有限、故不備整潔之歌詠服裝、此外、所內更有職業性藝術家、為他人作彩色肖像畫、孜孜不倦、</p>
<p>他人猜想、麻瘋病人必皆幽禁於白利南路收容所、實則不然、彼等均可隨時離所、上海並無禁止麻瘋病人往來之法律、惟若輩巳慣於留所共處、不離其極親近之赫醫生、</p>
<p>所外病人</p>
<p>赫醫師在卡德路亦設有麻瘋病診療所、為收容所外之麻瘋病患者約四百人診治、每週一或二次、注射Chaulmoogra油、貧苦免費、防止麻瘋菌蔓延、當推此油為最佳、</p>
<p>無慮傳染</p>
<p>據赫醫師談稱、麻瘋病不若肺病之易傳染、在肺病患者吐出之氣中呼吸、頗有傳染肺菌可能、但與麻瘋病患者雖常有接觸、亦可不受絲毫影響、渠與麻瘋病人相處巳二十載之久、仍未傳染此症、滬市本身、麻瘋病人不多、收容所內病人、大多來自滬市週圍各區、亦有若干人係市政當局送入者、其費用由當局負擔、</p>
<p>晨光月刋</p>
<p>收容所境况、現已大非昔比、赫醫生為病人日謀三餐、煞費心機、生產工作、亦因物料缺乏、近於停頓、然病人不求優暇、現仍出版月刋一種、均係手書、每見游客、即出示之、小册題名「晨光」、一若象徵彼等之追求光明者、</p>
<p>黃幻吾畫展</p>
<p>名畫家黃幻吾氏、去秋歸國、畫展盛况空前、哄動滬上、本擬再度去國漫遊、奈以交通不便、滯留滬上、閉門作畫、集其近作精品二百餘件、定四月廿七日起至五月三日止、假大新公司畫廳公展七天、想屆時轟動滬上可預卜也、</p>

<h3>震旦博物院　胃腸病展覽會記</h3>
<p>胃腸病展覽會陳列於勞神父路南呂班路震旦博物院，為宋大仁醫師紀念其創辦上海胃腸病院五週年而作，開幕已有多日，記者始於日昨抽暇往觀，塲中觀覽者甚形擁擠，或者高瞻或者俯察，莫不屛息靜氣注意其所欲注意者。記者巡視一週，不覺已耗去三四小時矣。茲乃略述其要，用備往觀者之參攷焉。</p>
<p>標本模型世所罕見</p>
<p>陳列材料，皆有詳細說明，計有標本模型：如胃腸病病理浸製實物，即係有病部分，施用開刀手術摘出用藥水製過，然後裝於標本瓶中。我國人對於遺體，甚為重視，即髮膚之微，不敢毀傷，是以此項標本之來源，頗不易求，雖然即國外醫院，亦不易畢備，縱使財力雄厚，亦有不易為力之處，聞此次出品者，蓄意已久，亦曾輾轉求之於數千里之外者。胃腸病病理模型；胃腸病病理組織標本；則皆聘請專門技師會同上海消化器病硏究所工作人員，親自督造，市肆中雖有　數種現成者出售，或不免於失眞。上海消化器病硏究所為專門硏究胃腸病之學術集團，地址在法租界福煦路。</p>
<p>中藥標本着天然色</p>
<p>胃腸病中藥標本計有百餘種，皆考證有治療作用之優良成績者，新鮮時攝成影片，傳以天然之彩色，至其藥用部分，則分裝標本匣中，一目了然，殊為美觀。其次如消化器病理圖譜：消化器病理繪圖；胃腸病表解等：病理圖譜，或參考各國精美之書册，或借自各大醫院之所收藏共計六七百幅，理病繪圖即於五年來經驗所得，據實繕寫，有不得以圖譜者則用表解，此種材料，費時頗久，皆非倉猝間所能畢事，宋醫師精審過人，絲毫不苟，是以診務之煩忙，病者之歡心，初非偶然。</p>
<p>儀器新奇攝影淸晰</p>
<p>診療方術：如探胃鏡；探胃鏡設色圖；幻燈片；胃腸病檢騐法圖解等等：此乃最新療法之工具，覽此者即可了解胃腸病之一斑，以胃腑深藏腹腔，肉眼何能透視，惟有新奇之儀器，足以解此困難，探胃鏡不獨能探視胃中之一切病與不病之情况，更能反映於外，並可攝影，醫者病者，皆可檢閱，斷無糢糊影響之弊。設色圖者，即系據實寫眞，不論病的與非病的，皆依原狀設色，與眞實臟腑無異。</p>
<p>寄生虫及殺虫方法</p>
<p>關於寄生蟲方面：有人體寄生蟲生活史圖；人體寄生蟲浸製標本；人體寄生蟲組織片（用電光裝置，精巧明亮甚便觀覽）；中外殺蟲藥品等等；蓋寄生蟲影響於人體健康，關係至大，而其種類亦甚多，普通人更不知人體寄生蟲之害怕，自然疏於防範，因此病胃腸之人，觸目皆是。今觀於生活史圖，亦當知所警覺矣。</p>
<p>文獻方面蒐羅豐富</p>
<p>至於文獻方面：有古今消化器圖一覽，此乃根據學術進化之跡，先由粗疏漏略，漸趨於詳備精細。宋氏中英文中國消化器病史，考證甚詳。餘如三十年來消化器病中文目錄；世界消化器病學論文目錄索引；世界消化器病學圖書目錄索引；此種工作，似易實難，一則斷非短時期中可以畢事，更須博識國際文獻，其於學術界之貢獻，至巨且大。纂輯方面：如歷代名醫騐案彙編　上海中外醫師胃腸病處方彙集；丹方彙編；丸散膏丹彙編；消化器病中外藥物製劑引得；於專門家之參考，皆足够興味。上海胃腸病院統計表，乃積五年來之成績分類統計，亦為難得之材料。</p>
<p>海煦樓之名貴著述</p>
<p>著述：分叢書論文二類，胃腸病叢書已出版有飮食指南闢肝胃氣痛說，尙有待印之稿七八種，論文前曾發表於各醫刋，印成單本者，約十餘種，未發表者二十餘種。宋氏海煦樓所藏，關於胃腸病之孤本珍本約十餘種，皆陳列於玻廚中。參考圖書：分中法德日英美數百種專門雜誌，數量亦甚可觀。此種展覽會，為滬上不易經見而至為名貴者，尤其胃腸病者，十人而九，以人莫不飮食也，病由口入者居多，有此良好盛會，何可失之交臂。</p>
<p>陳列品均出資保險</p>
<p>據聞所有陳列品以價値過巨曾由某大保險公司担任保險，納資亦頗不少，法總領事馬氏念觀時，以宋醫師出品宏富而精審，深佩宋氏之學術，趨與握手，不勝欣快，會期至五月十一日止，每日下午一時半至五時，同時可參閱該博物院上下樓，各種珍奇古玩及稀見之動物，並有蜂蟻之眞實窩穴，盛於巨大玻璃裝置，　炬反光，可以直窺其生活工作，亦奇觀也。</p>

<h3>投資投機迷離撲朔　華股為游資集中</h3>
<p>— 惠</p>
<p>上週華商股票市况過程，生氣蓬勃。揆其原因，實受紗價之扶搖直上，金市之突飛猛漲，外股之繼續俏升，均予人心無限興奮，復以種種之有利因素，於是促成華商股票之活躍。就現階段而言，華商股票籌碼，本屬有限，一經買戶搜購，即形成供不敷求，是以價格之向前挺進，殆屬意中事也。</p>
<p>綜括　週間之華商股票市價，百貨業如永安，新新先平而堅。中國內衣自出二十元關後，底盤巳見穩固，更以紗價上漲之關係，故一度曾升至廿五元外，雖旋即回下，然穩站在廿四元半左右。金融業股成交初寂後盛，中國銀行價徘徊一百四十至五元間。交通銀行一百卅七元半至四十元。大陸銀行前週頗呈活躍，上週以來，殊乏動靜。浙江興業，浙江實業，上海銀行等，進出無多。新藥業股因各公司，去年度股息紅利，大都均尙未派發，致本週間各家發息之說，甚囂塵上，有力者且乘間紛紛搜購，流通籌碼，頓現匱乏。新亞新股初料三十五元關難以穿出，然至週五，卒吿實現，一度昂至卅六元二角半。中法新股由五十四元左右挺至五十八元，尙有續漲可能。其他各股，亦莫不先平而後秀。實業股世界新股，大戶吸收，賡續不衰，價由五十九元升至七十元邊關。大中華火柴趨勢徘徊。紡織業股如永安紗廠，達豐染織，慶紡織等，市價均有進無退，殆受紗價挺升有以致之耳。</p>
<p>總之，投資於華商股票之穩妥可靠，巳為社會人士一致公認。然欲使工商企業之發展，必須使其呆定資金籌碼流通，工商企業旣得資金之扶植，則如魚得水，如木向榮，前途發展，無可限量。上週華商股票之蓬勃現象，實為吾人所欣慰者也。</p>
<h3>債市爭持</h3>
<p>— 桑</p>
<p>一度漲停板　僵持尙未己</p>
<p>上週間公債市况，以整個趨勢言之：已一反過去之萎靡局面，而轉入堅挺穩定之狀態中。惟買賣雙方，均具雄厚勢力；因此六天中之過程，倐漲倐跌，變幻多端，有極度之掙扎；結果多方暫獲勝利，各種週六之收盤價格，較前週六收盤均見上漲。計甲種升四元一角，乙種升三元八角，丙種升三元四角，丁種升四元一角，戊種升四元，茲以其過去情形，略作回顧於後：</p>
<p>當週一初開各方之零星浮空，均在趁低補進，而以前數週不斷猛抛之新貨頭寸，巳皙時停止賣出；因此檯面形勢頓轉穩定，各種開始回漲半元至一元　角不等，惟翌日該方之新貨又有一批出來，買氣銳勢為之挫折：所幸所售為數有限，故結果漲跌均見，但買賣雙方之目標，頗為不同；前者趨於丙種，而後者專注於乙戊兩種，致竟發現乙種比丙種低下三角之奇蹟；而戊種比丙種又須小去五元，週三各報有利多消息披露，金融界之主力銀行幫及北幫，亦開始在猛力吸收，市勢驟吿蓬勃：甲種橫跳四元，竟致漲停板；週四續有發展，惟大戶之新貨，方在靜候高價謀求出路，因此見價愈高，吐售愈湧；多方憚於　方之不知究有多少實貨流出，亦不得不稍歛聲勢；於是氣象遂不若過去之熱烈，而轉入恍惚不定之局，迨至週末，浮多已不耐久守，開始出籠；此時買賣雙方之大戶，均收兵靜觀中，故儘任浮多傾軋，於是走趨一路低落，甲丙兩種跌勢尤勁，全週各種最高價均於週五見之，而最低價除丁戊二種見於週二外，其餘三種均在週一中發現。</p>
<p>瞻望前途趨勢，以一般觀察言之：多空雙方似均在嚴陣以待，準備發動一次決戰：但賣方則以價格過低不願賤售，而多方亦不肯高價背進；因此預料雙方角逐雖烈，尙不有致一面倒之情形發現。其或為消息所鼓勵，則須視利於何方，而得賴以助長聲勢，則庶能決定勝敗之誰屬也。</p>
<h3>兎起鶻落之　紗布旋風</h3>
<p>— 泉</p>
<p>上週紗布情勢，起伏仍大，初在利多買風之下，同業活躍收購，故粗細紗布，續向新高峯厲進，最高時二十支　馬廠單　見五千四百八十元，現貨見六千二百元，二十支雙地球紗見六千二百五十元，十二磅大鵬細布見二百三十五元，十六磅地球粗布見二百六十五元，均破　來紀錄，降及週四，獲利者因連朝猛漲，乘高吐售，於是市盤一度回跌，雙馬廠單最低曾至四千三百二十元，一週來漲跌差度竞達一千餘元巨額，而粗細布疋亦都二三十元左右，旋度亦頗宏大，嗣以廠家生產不豐，現貨籌碼續緊，大戶逢低拖進，復轉昂騰，惟待後謠興頻盛，人心不若週始穩定，致市氣隨之飄忽，乃呈兎起鶻落之象，一路上騰之紗布情况，遂又入於迂迥曲折之境域矣。</p>
<p>然與前週市價相比，結果提漲仍巨，十支紗約昇三四百元，二十支紗約昇五百元至一千餘元，其中尤以雙地球紗漲風最厲，較前週激漲一千零五十元以外，三十二支以上各級紗支則亦跳起千元左右，因是齒脣相依之棉布，同時提昇二三十元左右。</p>
<p>就上週變動之各種紗布情况綜合言之，上落最驟者當推雙馬廠單最為敏捷，良自當局統制物資移運後，棉貨之移動問題，已成為心思市塲推卜之焦點，故目下雙馬廠單與現貨，遂發生相差六七百元之巨額現象，惟至上週末曾受廠單可以車出之影響，引起顯著反應，是以兩者差度，稍見軋攏，次為投機市塲中多頭掉期掉費繼續存在，最高時多頭曾有掉出五十元之未有高價，此種情形，泃為反映市塲浮多，日形增加，吾人若按反動原理而論，自紗價經連日直綫上騰後，脚地綫已漸漸荏弱，如果略有意外刺激，反響之可能性將日趨增加，但以長期走化觀察，紗布基本脚地，仍極良好也。</p>

<p>衛生</p>
<h3>可怕的壁書</h3>
<p>— 虛閣</p>
<p>一天，在新　衛生實騐區的屋子裏，發現牆壁上掛着有幾個鏡框。當然這些鏡框都是呆呆的不言亦不語，可是從各種圖表和文字統計上看來，却不得不叫人觸目驚心哩。</p>
<p>「生死有命，富貴在天，」不錯，這話是對的。可是把生和死的統計給你看，你就要覺得事情沒有那樣簡單了。從生育統計和死亡統計的兩個表上看起來，咱們中國總是佔最多數。生育旣多，死亡也快，幾幾乎成了個對冲」。生育和死亡率最高的，除了中國之外，其次便是印度。</p>
<p>壽為五福之首，那末我們來看「各國平均人壽比較」表罷。中國又是叨居首位，男女平均的壽命，中國人為三十歲。其次便是日、法、美、丹。丹是丹麥人，女性平均壽命為六一·九歲，男性六〇·三歲。差不多兩個中國人的壽命，才能抵過一個丹麥人哩。</p>
<p>有了疾病不知找正常的醫生，平時不知衛生，像這樣寃枉死的人，據那「每年超格死亡」統計所列，中國人每年就有六百萬人做「枉死鬼」。每人每年的經濟消耗，以最低限度估計，假定為五十元。（當然這是指以前的物價而言。若論目下只好買一斗米了。）那末一年中這項經濟損失就要三十萬萬元了。縮少範圍來講，每年寃枉死的人，每千人中佔十五人，他們的平均年齡為十歲。</p>
<p>其他像產婦死亡率，傳染病死亡率等，中國又是高中「天字第一」號。</p>
<p>各國傳染病死亡人數，中國的百分率為四二·三佔最高率；澳大利亞最低為百分之九。天氣漸漸熱了，傳染病又將抬頭，我們看到這種統計數字，能不寒心？</p>
<p>為什麽一個人要講究衛生？公共衛生為何為市政實施上的首要之圖？這簡單的「壁書」似乎能解答一切了。</p>
<p>風土</p>
<h3>伊朗的市集</h3>
<p>— 楊化時</p>
<p>每年春天，四五月之間，以遊牧為生的伊朗人，在伊斯巴罕地方，有一個盛大的市集。</p>
<p>從十六世紀波斯國王大亞巴士時代起，直至今日，熱鬧的情况未有如何改變，這市集以梅丹為中心，一個長約五百公尺的廣塲，是以前君主們閱兵或接見外國使臣的所在地；附近有一所藍色屋頂的回敎寺，寺內寬大的走廊也充作臨時商塲，終年關閉的樓閣在此時却一齊開放了。</p>
<p>天氣晴朗，誰都感到愉快，許多人在進行他們一年中最重要的交易，到處充滿了中世紀的東方色彩。</p>
<p>伊朗的君主和貴族均來此參觀，更增加民衆的興趣，最富有的地毯商布商將貨物堆積在一個昔日王公的私邸的大院中，他們的舖子總是設在一扇古銅的大門前。</p>
<p>雜貨攤最多，出售各地運來的菜子，化粧品，香料，茴香，肉桂，落花生，棗漿，葡萄乾，瓜子，此外還有鏡子，蜜糖，胭脂之類，也有賣藥料的，這都是土人們最需要的東西。</p>
<p>許多食品店，門口紮着花綵，將爐子放在門前，烘着各種糕餅，過路的人都要買些嘗嘗。</p>
<p>在這個市集中，至少有五十個寳石商。低矮的玻璃櫃中，陳列着金耳環與手鐲，琥珀的項圈，品質粗劣的藍寳石，仿古式的戒指，使人悅目的細金銀綫。愛裝飾的伊朗女人，購買這種東西，都得一年一次趕集。</p>
<p>賣鑊子的雖有大批的貨物，但還不停手地在打鐵，一陣陣響聲震耳欲聾。染匠也在這裹招攬生意，他們的手都染成藍色，紫色，赭色……四周都放着染缸，外來的遊客莫不感到奇怪。</p>
<p>寺內的隧道中，有許多孩子專售瓦罐，盆，碟之類。氈毯商的花樣最多，口中唱着古怪的曲子，吸引顧客，有的全身穿潘白衣（白帽，白袴，長袍）在一架小機上織毯，伊朗的毛毯世界馳名，這裏所賣的，價錢極為便宜。</p>
<p>阿拉伯人在過道處，掛了使人注目的顏色招牌，出售家畜和鳥類，而他們的商品，都放在空地上的大篷帳中。</p>
<p>這裏也有許多修鞋匠，常免費為兵士巡警們的皮鞋擦油，他們專補破鞋，凡脫綫壞底的經修理後，宛然如新，顧客極多，所以這些修鞋匠也有等級，技巧好的都是高等人士光顧，招待也格外殷勤，有幾個在攤子旁，一邊掛了一隻鳥籠，另一邊放着幾朶鮮花，使人容易辨認。</p>
<p>在一角，有一所很小的回敎寺，這是給參加市集的商人來作祈禱的，舖石塊的院子裏，有一個盛聖水的小池，頗使遊客注意。</p>
<p>近處的人，都來伊斯巴罕的市集採辦貨物，遠處的居民，每隔幾年必來一次，所以滿眼都是黃鬍子的猶太人，長服的回敎徒，天藍色制服的兵士。許多土人穿了百餘年來未換式樣的服裝，騎了驢子趕來，有的將他們的白馬身上塗了各種顏色，乍見的人，還以為是一種奇異的野獸，在動物園裏也沒有見過。</p>
<p>許多着英國式制服的警察，也在市中巡　，目的在維持秩序，或者保護來此的官員。近處的窮人，男的，女的，老的，殘廢的都上集來求乞，往往成羣結隊的將店舖包圍，警察將他們驅逐後，不過多時，又聚在另一家店門口了。</p>
<p>春天過後，人們才離開這裏。</p>
<h3>自信的力</h3>
<p>— 葉玫珍譯</p>
<p>假使有誰能實覺人類內蓄的潛力，這人必能完成大志。但是人們時常否認，而且輕視自己。他們祇會抱怨着說：」我不過是個人。」或者「我是個女子。能做什麽呢？」</p>
<p>茀勞倫斯·耐丁格不是女子嗎？她却創辦了紅十字會，假如這位英籍護士為了自己祇是一個女子而空自悲怨，那麽治傷的功業能做到什麽？今日的世界又該如何悲慘呢？</p>
<p>假使居里夫人當丈夫死後祇會看輕自己而袖手空嘆：「我不過是個女子！」那麽今日　錠的神奇工作又何能存在呢？</p>
<p>對了！不管你是什麽。祇耍你肯執拗的說：「我能相信。這就够了！」如耐丁格和居里夫人曾說的。於是她們以充量的雄心和信仰來對付自己的工作。</p>
<p>當六歲的兒子由學校帶回了開除通知書時，這位母親就無可如何了嗎？「我的兒子並不笨。我要自己訓練他。」她說。於是她眞的實行起來。湯姆斯·愛迪生因此成功了！</p>

<h3>具體而微的海底遊</h3>
<p>— 劍農</p>
<p>——震旦博物院一瞥</p>
<p>當我每次讀了科學家海底探險的描述以後，我是多麽心嚮往之的恨不能也追隨着他們，乘着潛水鐘，在那神秘的海國裏，目睹那些奇奇怪怪形形色色的各種動植物的生態啊！這種夢想，想不到的，却似乎在震旦博物院的一個角落裏給我實現了。…</p>
<p>在那裏，—二樓最深處的當中—有一張幾乎正方形的檯子，上面和四周全有玻璃罩護着：假設你把那淨瑩的玻璃當作淸澈的海水而往裏面注射一下眼光的話，你當能意識到那父是多麽逼眞的一片具體而微的海洋啊。…最下層，有酷似海底的碎石細沙平舖着，其上有磊砢隆起的岩石，有　　多枝的珊瑚。這些珊瑚，有紅白灰各色：有的枝柯扶疎，彷彿一株古柏，有的根榦偃蹇，好像一棵老松；可是最美麗動人的，還是那千層萬瓣皺褶多姿儼然兩朶白牡丹花的不知道名字的東西。</p>
<p>論到旁的動物：你看那頂盔貫甲，偃臥在沙灘上的龐大的龍蝦，你看那磨礪以須隱伏在暗礁中的么小的擁劍。還有那擁盾牌的幾種螃蟹：有的兩螯特長，以表示牠那不論遠近見物就摟的貪婪心；更有那負堡壘的各色各式的蚌螺：有的尖銳若筆，有的鋒楞如瓦，有的長骨森竪，以表示牠那棘人手指不容冒犯的神態。…</p>
<p>然而最足以惹人注意而叫我賞玩獨久的，却是夭矯的竪在正中心的那渾身雪白屬於海綿科的所謂「愛神的花籃！」也叫偕老同穴。—一隻花籃？眞的，你看愛神—大自然—把它編織得是多麽精緻多麽美麗啊？它的形像彷彿圓　，上端稍粗而附着在岩石上的根梢較細；高約七八寸，直徑在最粗的地方不過一寸有餘；渾身上下完全是用雪白而柔韌的細絲織就的：先有一組一組排列勻整的經綫從根梢上升到頂端，然後有一圈一圈的緯綫橫穿過去把它們界成正方的孔目；更有蒙茸的毳毛彌縫這些孔目的四角，以致於叫它們變成六角或圓形；另外還有一縷一縷螺旋着織上去的細絲，到了上端便結成又似花邊又似流蘇的點綴物。…天哪！最聰明的畫　能造得出這種細緻的圖案，最精巧的針神繡聖能織成功這種嬌小玲瓏的作品麽？…</p>
<p>我立在這「愛神的花籃」旁邊，出神的賞鑒，玩索：我驚訝贊嘆大自然的奇妙！…</p>

<h3>機關槍式擴音器</h3>
<p>— 永運</p>
<p>最新式的聲音擴大器，樣子像機關槍。據說，這種樣式的効果最大，播音時可使聽衆聽得格外淸哳，一切混雜的聲音都可避去。只時有人說這種式樣對於聽衆心理上的影響不好，尤其是在戰時。</p>
<h3>馬爾太島小記</h3>
<p>— 大芬</p>
<p>最近報載軸心方面不斷空襲馬爾太島。但，這個蕞爾小島，已由英國慘淡經營了一百四十三年，她似決不肯輕易讓諸人手的。有個英國政論家說：「只要馬爾太島是我們的，勝利一定在握。」</p>
<p>但，這個長不過十七哩，闊僅九哩的小鳥，有什麽重要呢！其實它的重要性全由於地位關係。它位於地中海中意大利與非洲間最狹之處，軍略家稱之為地中海的鎖鑰。與地中海口的直布羅陀及紅海南端的亞丁成鼎足而三之勢，保障大英帝國經蘇伊士運河至印度航運之安全。</p>
<p>馬爾太島不僅為海空軍根據地，目為重要之加煤站。港灣絕佳，世罕其匹。英國地中海艦隊司令部即設於此，海港中可見各式軍艦及潛艇等。島上有兵工塲，儲煤亦特豐。</p>
<p>馬爾太島人口約有二十四萬，平均每方哩有二百人以上，所以不能自給自足。島上農民約有一萬人，出產貧瘠，僅有少量的麥，蔬菜，及蘋果等。每年出口總値計二十五萬鎊，而入口則達四百萬鎊，入超甚鉅。事實上馬爾太島的生存端賴英國皇家海軍，他們為修理等每年耗金達一百萬鎊之數，皆為馬爾太之船塢工人，機械工人等所獲。今日馬爾太島街頭所見者儘為水手，兵士，空軍人員，工程服務人員，及路過之商人等，已煥然一改昔日五方雜處之面目了。</p>

<p>國芳打算請維城去的，維城不能去，倒給他把國芳留下來了。只幾天的　違，已經要把說的話積了許多許多，維城是這樣，國芳也是這樣。起先是挑大的遠的談，像葉大太太的開喪等等；後來涉到小的近的，維城也問到國芳身上穿的衣料是多少錢一尺。他們在雙梅書屋裏隨意坐，喜鵲走來走去伺候；翠珍知道國芳是不走了，便決定在雙梅書屋的內室，預備給國芳下榻。維城笑道：「翠珍姊，你不要忙，來和國芳談談。國芳雖然是在上海學校裏讀書的，上海雖然是個繁華綺麗之塲；女學校又是個被人看做貴族化之所；可是國芳不曾沾染着什麽習氣。來和她談談。」翠珍手裏拿了一個鷄毛撣帚，站定了笑道：「我不會說什麽的，你們一談，就談書上的，我全不懂。不說話，陳小姐還笑在肚子裏，一說話，陳小姐就笑在面上了。」國芳本來坐在一張椅子上的，聽翠珍這樣說，她差不多是跳起來，走過去扯了翠珍的胳膊，按她在椅子裏坐下道：「我也喚你翠珍姊了。你是葉家的一位無名英雄，我家裏，就沒有。我家裏只有一位祖母……」維城道：「你把翠珍姊和令祖母相提並論，這是翠珍姊不敢當的。我說大家隨便談談，我們是住在鄕村裏，還不比得國芳住在雙橋鎭上，要買東西，吃的用的，都可以便利一些，說一句實話，到這裏，便是招待不周。」國芳笑道：「你才不許我客氣，你倒又客氣了。」（六〇）</p>

<h3>German Parliament Convened Yesterday, Hitler Delivered a Speech, Declaring Continued Warfare in Eastern Europe, Retaliation for British Air Raids, German Parliament Passes Resolution Granting Hitler Special Powers of Appointment and Dismissal</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Haitong News Agency) - Official sources here announced this morning that the German Parliament convened at 3:00 PM today.</p>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Urgent Telegram from Nong Haitong News Agency) - Führer Hitler delivered a speech to the Parliament, which lasted for an hour. Speaker of Parliament, General Göring, moved to empower the Führer to conscript any German citizen, order them to devote their utmost loyalty, and dismiss those who disobey or fail in their duties at any time. After the Speaker proposed this motion, it was immediately approved and unanimously passed.</p>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Urgent Telegram from Haitong News Agency) - At the beginning of his speech, Führer Hitler pointed out that in his speech to Parliament on December 11th of last year, he summarized the major disasters of the past year. The significant impact of these disasters may not be fully understood until hundreds of years later. After the suppression of the Belgrade rebellion incited by England and the Soviet Union, Europeans began to understand the threat from the East (Soviet Union). The world was forced into war in September 1939, and people began to understand the truth of the causes of the bloody conflict. On September 3rd of that year, England and France, disregarding Germany's efforts to maintain peace, declared war on Germany, and England and France led Poland to the fuse. England and France also created the catastrophe for humanity. Hitler declared that the war in Eastern Europe would continue. We are determined to destroy the Red Army. History will show whether victory in the winter war ultimately belongs to the attackers who disregard human life and blindly sacrifice, or to the defenders who conserve their strength. Hitler pointed out that the production of German submarines has increased sharply, and in the future, dealing with British submarines will be even more active. Hitler mentioned the atrocities of British aircraft bombing German civilians, saying that retaliatory strikes will be taken in the future, and the precedent of 1940 can serve as proof. Hitler requested Parliament to grant him the power to adjust German citizens at any time, order them to do their best to fulfill their responsibilities, and punish those who disobey at any time. Hitler analyzed the points of conflict of interest between the belligerent countries, saying that one side is defending the legitimate rights of its own people, while the other is a puppet of international parasitic Jews. Hitler revealed that the German forces fighting in Eastern Europe have even better and stronger armaments.</p>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Haitong News Agency) - The German people are eagerly awaiting the German government's statement in Parliament this afternoon. The news of the German Parliament convening was only broadcast by radio to various places this morning, and was not published in this morning's newspapers, which caused general surprise. The last session of the German Parliament was held on December 11, 1941, after the United States entered the war. At that time, the Führer delivered a speech, announcing that Germany, Italy, and Japan would jointly fight against Britain and the United States until final victory. Later, the Führer delivered a speech once on January 30, the anniversary of the Nazi Party's assumption of power, pointing out that Germany would be able to achieve even greater victories this year. The German government's re-issuance of a statement this time has naturally attracted attention from all parties.</p>
<h3>Brazil Will Change Ambassadors to Europe</h3>
<p>Argentina, Capital City, 26th (Haitong News Agency) - According to news from the capital of Brazil, the Brazilian government will change its diplomatic officials stationed in Europe in the near future. It is reported that the Brazilian ambassador to Spain, Rocas, will be replaced by the former ambassador to Germany, Valery. The ambassador to Portugal, Olaiu, will be replaced by Navans, and the ambassador to France, Tandas, will also be replaced. It is also asked that a special committee be established to conduct research after the service years have been completed.</p>
<h3>Uruguay Protects Military Centers, Special Committee to Conduct Research</h3>
<p>Uruguay, Capital City, 25th (Havas News Agency) - The Uruguayan government has appointed a special committee to study methods to protect the country's military centers. The issue of German residents purchasing property near the Boaya Salang Chay military airfield is also frequently studied.</p>
<h3>Japanese General Election Imminent</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Allied News Agency) - The Japanese general election is imminent, and competition in various places is extremely fierce. As of the 25th, the total number of candidates was 1,070. Polling in remote electoral districts has been brought forward since the 24th, and the turnout rate is better than the previous election. In addition, the significance of this election campaign is different from the past. Therefore, the authorities of the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Justice are doing their best to prevent electoral misconduct. At present, except for Mr. Yukio Ozaki, who has been prosecuted by the prosecuting authorities for making inappropriate remarks in his speech, there are no other significant violations.</p>
<h3>Axis Diplomats in Brazil to be Sent Back Home</h3>
<p>Brazil, National Capital, 25th (Havas News Agency) - Personnel from Axis consulates in the interior of Brazil have recently arrived here one after another and will be sent back home.</p>
<p>Brazil, Capital City, 25th (Havas News Agency) - The Spanish ship "Cape of Good Hope," carrying Axis diplomats in South America and several staff members of the Spanish Embassy in Brazil, left here today to return to Spain. It will pass through the British territory of Trinidad along the way, and permission has been obtained from the relevant parties.</p>
<h3>Abundant Rainfall in Changde and Taoyuan Areas</h3>
<p>Changde, 26th - Abundant rainfall has recently occurred in the Changde and Taoyuan areas. Water has accumulated in the fields everywhere, and farmers are busy plowing and planting. There should be no problems with this year's rice harvest.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador Sato Meets with Soviet Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>Kuybyshev, 26th (Allied News Agency)</p>
<p>The new Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sato, met with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky last Friday.</p>
<h3>Batavia Implements Foreigner Registration</h3>
<p>Batavia, 26th (Allied News Agency)</p>
<p>Foreigner registration has been implemented here since the 20th. As of the 25th, approximately 1,000 people have registered, of whom Overseas Chinese account for 80%, and Dutch and Dutch mixed-race people account for the least.</p>
<h3>The U.S. Sets Trade Conference for Next Month, Fifth, and Has Already Drafted a Broad Plan to Control National Economic Life</h3>
<p>Washington, 25th (Havas News Agency) - Commerce Secretary Jones, on the order of President Roosevelt, has convened representatives of the federal government and state authorities to participate in a trade conference on May 5th. The conference is tentatively scheduled for three days. The invitations signed by the President have already been distributed to the state governors and informed of the main agenda, which is to study how to eliminate shipping restrictions between states and other commercial obstacles that "hinder the war effort." In addition, President Roosevelt has also scheduled to submit a message to Congress on the 27th. The draft has already been prepared, but it is said that the message will be broadcast nationwide at that time, and a speech will be delivered separately.</p>
<p>Washington, 25th (Havas News Agency) - It has been learned that the government has decided to issue an order next Tuesday to "freeze" all prices in order to prevent inflation. It is heard that the government has drafted a broad plan to control national economic life, and freezing prices is one of the steps set out in it. In addition, the Price Administration has also promulgated regulations regarding the stabilization of export prices, stipulating that export prices should be based on cost, plus a semi-average profit from July 1, 1940, to December 31, and should not exceed this limit.</p>
<h3>The U.S. Shipbuilding Plan Is Still Difficult to Fully Implement</h3>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Havas News Agency) - U.S. President Roosevelt told the press yesterday that the shipbuilding plan would be difficult to fully implement for the time being due to the insufficient supply of copper plates. Political figures here are paying close attention to this, saying that England's launching of the current war was all due to Roosevelt's admission that the United States would be a "democratic arsenal." But in practice, the United States cannot complete its naval shipbuilding plan, which Roosevelt himself has admitted. England's hope of winning the war relies entirely on the United States supplying munitions, and its future is even gloomier, which goes without saying. Therefore, Roosevelt's remarks are really worth pondering. In addition, the New York Times recently published a shocking article, recording the activities of the Communist Party in the American schools in New York, and warning the U.S. authorities to prevent the Bolshevik crisis. In England, its "Empire Review" magazine also published an article, severely criticizing the administration of the British Empire. All these points can prove that the internal situation in the United States and Britain is difficult, and there are few solutions.</p>
<h3>Egypt Establishes More Ambassadors, Both Parties Can Decide</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 26th (Reuters News Agency) - An agreement has been reached with the Egyptian government here to exchange ambassadors, and the candidates have been decided. We are now awaiting Cairo's approval. It is rumored that the current minister to the Near East, Zhang Pengchun, will be transferred to Chile.

<h3>New Zealand</h3>
<p>Recently, New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser confirmed that New Zealand and its island territories, including the Lian Fei Qi Islands, have been designated as a region called the South Pacific Region. New Zealand is located southeast of the Australian continent. Its main body is the North and South Islands, and its terrain is like a long boot. The North Island is the lower part of the boot; the northernmost end is a flat peninsula, and the southern end is mountainous, with many volcanoes and hot springs. The South Island is the upper part of the boot, with a range of high mountains on the west side, called the Southern Alps, with many high peaks and glaciers. The coastline is still developed, especially the northern end of the North Island. The Cook Strait is between the two islands and is a waterway for ships.

It is understood that the United States will not take the same steps, but if there are new developments in the situation that force the United States to revise its current policy towards France, then that will be another matter. As for the other staff of the embassy in Vichy after Ambassador Lee Hsi returned home, they will still remain in Vichy, because maintaining diplomatic relations between the United States and France can keep communication between the United States and France open, which is beneficial.</p>
<p>New York, 26th (Reuters News Agency) - The French Consul at Diqurote in the United States, Langet, has resigned after Laval became the head of the French government. Yanflai, the acting agent of the French Consulate, has also resigned.</p>

<h3>U.S. and Peru Sign Commercial Treaty</h3>
<p>Washington, 25th (Havas) - Agriculture Secretary Vegaard recently stated that the United States has signed a commercial treaty with Peru, stipulating that the United States will purchase more than 200,000 bales of cotton from Peru each year during the war. The Peruvian government will always cooperate with the United States to reduce the production of excess cotton. Some parties here believe that this commercial treaty is the first step towards controlling international cotton harvests and may have significant consequences, because this plan will not only be implemented during the war, but will continue to be promoted after the war in order to limit production, standardize prices, and balance supply and demand. It is heard that the U.S. government is currently negotiating the same agreement with Brazil.</p>

<h3>Nine. Temples and Architecture of India (Part 1)</h3>
<p>Indian art, with its unique splendor in the cultural history of the world, is well known to all, mainly because India is the birthplace of Buddhism, and Buddhist art is unique. The most magnificent and grand of Indian art is architecture, unparalleled in the world. The author is a layman in Indian architecture, and now, based on what I have learned from reading, I will briefly summarize it to append to the end of the special issue. I am not presumptuous, but also intend to elicit valuable opinions.</p>
<p>Ancient Buildings in the Area of the Dead</p>
<p>Indian culture is generally believed to have been created by the Indo-Aryans. It has a long history. Even architectural art is unlikely to be an exception, because the history before the Indo-Aryans is unknown, which is indeed inevitable. However, with the passage of time and the development of science, in the past ten years or so, the history of Indian culture, thanks to the efforts of archaeologists, has been advanced to thousands of years before the Indo-Aryans. The subsequent development has not yet been limited, so the cultural historians of various countries in the world may have a major shift in their views on India.</p>
<p>India has an archaeological bureau, headed by Marshall (Sir. John Marshall), who is engaged in the excavation of ancient sites throughout India and has achieved remarkable results. About ten years ago, he excavated the ruins of an ancient city in Mohenjo-daro, which was a relic of 5,000 years ago, which was even more amazing. His contribution to the academic world is extremely significant. Mohenjo-daro means "Area of the Dead" and was originally just a few piles of desolate mounds covered with weeds. Its high point had a Buddhist ruin. The place was indeed as the name suggests, uninhabited for a long time, but the broken bricks in the soil in the surrounding wilderness attracted the attention of archaeologists, and they dug under the pagoda and obtained an unprecedented discovery. What was discovered was a city from the Copper and Stone Age. The most important of these about architecture were reservoirs, ditches, wells, bathrooms, and streets. As for ancient seals, ancient pottery, and ancient decorations, there were also many, all of which could confirm that they were objects from 5,000 years ago. Here, I will only talk about architecture.</p>
<p>The reservoir was made of fire-resistant bricks, 39 feet long and 23 feet wide, in a rectangular shape, built in the center of a huge building. There was a platform around the reservoir. There were originally arches around the platform, all enclosed within the walls. As for the construction of the reservoir itself, it was extremely ingenious. When laying bricks, it was known to apply gypsum asphalt, which is even more impressive. The pool walls were also polished to make them shiny. The arrangement of the bricks in the pool bed was also very neat. There was a huge staircase at each of the north and south ends of the pool, so it led into the pool. The pool bed gradually sloped towards the northwest, so it led the water into a huge ditch. As for how the water was introduced and the function of the reservoir, it is still not clear.</p>
<p>The system of ditches is also most worthy of attention. The first part is long enough for a person to stand upright without hindrance. The ditch was originally covered with wooden planks, and the ditch bed was paved with bricks. At the other end of the top, there are holes opened for people to enter and exit regularly to do cleaning work. Later, the ditch shape gradually became lower and narrower, and entered a winding passage. There are many ditches in the streets, all parallel to each other, or with two or three ditches, and all leading into the main ditch. For water at high places, mud pipes were used to dredge it. There are private wells and public wells, which are set at a corner of the street or outside its edge. The well is paved with bricks and connected to a ditch, and its shape is very similar to Chinese wells. The bathroom architecture is also good, similar to a brick-built small well, surrounded by walls.</p>
<p>The main streets of the area of the dead run from south to north in parallel lines, and the small lanes are made at the right corner of the streets. In this way, the houses are located in one side, and the street plan is like the most modern American city today, which is also amazing.</p>
<p>There were no corridors or gardens, and the courtyards were very small. The houses were mostly two stories high, with separate stairs, showing that two families lived in one house. The population in this city must have been very large, and the social organization must have been good, which can be asserted.</p>
<p>Based on the relics of the area of the dead, the Indo-Aryans called their ancestors "black charcoal." Who knew that their civilization was far superior to the self-proclaimed victors, the Indo-Aryans. When Smith's Indian seal was discovered, Waddell (L.A. Waddell) had already claimed that Indian culture originated from Sumer. Now, the excavation of the area of the dead has made the theory that Indian culture was created by the Indo-Aryans shake, which is undoubtedly true.</p>
<p>A Brief Account of Buddhist Architecture</p>
<p>The most grateful Indian architecture for the world is Buddhist architecture, not only for the bewilderment of art, but also with religious meaning. However, the buildings created by Sakyamuni when he was alive have not been left behind. The Buddhist buildings that exist are mostly built by later generations, such as the Great Temple of Gaya, the place where Sakyamuni attained enlightenment, which was rebuilt by Burmese monks in the fourteenth century and greatly repaired by the Indian government in 1884. It is 160 feet high and can be seen from seven miles away. The oldest of the existing relics are the stone pillars of King Ashoka and the Songxi Pagoda.</p>
<p>The Ashoka stone pillars are relics from around 250 BC. They are round pillars with a bell-shaped top, surrounded by wheel-shaped patterns, and a lion sits on top of them. The pillar body is engraved with Ashoka's edict. The total height is 32 feet 9 and a half inches, the diameter of the base is 35 inches cattle, and the diameter of the top is 26 inches father a quarter. Its intention, style, and technique are all unique to India. The lion's posture is strong and solid, and it is enough to see the greatness of the ancient Indian art. There are still three similar commemorative stone pillars, which will not be fully described now.</p>

<h3>In the Area of Dunkirk, Northern France, Intense Air Battles Between Germany and Britain; Many Docks and Factories Bombed</h3>
<p>London, 26th - Reuters - The Air Ministry announced that British planes had launched six large-scale offensives within eleven hours yesterday. The combat zone stretched 250 miles from Dunkirk to Cherbourg. Near Abbeville, a large number of German fighter planes engaged in aerial combat, marking the first such large-scale engagement this year. The intensity of the fighting was unprecedented since the start of the war.</p>
<p>London, 26th - Reuters - The Air Ministry announced last night: "Our planes launched a large-scale offensive in northern France today. In the morning, several squadrons of fighters escorted many Boston bombers to attack the ports of Cherbourg and Dunkirk, bombing several docks. They also escorted Whirlwind bombers to attack a factory in Calais. Five German fighter planes were shot down over Dunkirk. In the afternoon, a squadron of Boston bombers, escorted by fighters, attacked the ports of Le Havre and Abbeville, bombing docks and train yards. Several aerial battles occurred with German planes, and three were shot down. One of our bombers and fifteen fighters are missing."</p>
<p>London, 26th - Reuters - In addition to attacking Rostock in the Baltic Sea last night, the British Air Force also bombed the Skoda armaments factory in Czechoslovakia. This was the third time British planes had bombed Europe's second-largest armaments factory. The first time was in October 1940, on the 22nd anniversary of Czech independence. Only a small number of bombers participated in the raid at that time.</p>
<p>Fire in Rostock</p>
<p>London, 26th - Reuters - According to reports, the British Air Force's second attack on Rostock, Germany, was as successful as the first. The Heinkel aircraft factory, located one or two miles north of the city, was bombed by airmen, who glimpsed a raging fire. Several areas of the port also caught fire, burning brightly. Many coastal stacks were engulfed in flames. A British plane flew as low as 1,000 feet for reconnaissance. However, the city was shrouded in thick smoke, and searchlights could not penetrate it. The famous German Heinkel aircraft factory is large in scale, with many factory buildings occupying an area almost equal to the old city's site. The current attack targeted the largest of these factories. Each factory cooperates, with smaller factories specializing in manufacturing components, and larger factories assembling them into aircraft. The main factory can produce six Heinkel fighters, bombers, and seaplanes daily, and has its own airfield, runways, and seaplane slipways, the length of which exceeds that of other airfields.</p>
<p>London, 26th - Reuters - British bombers attacked Rostock, Germany, on the Baltic coast for the third consecutive night last night (Saturday). British heavy bombers also attacked the Skoda factory in Pilsen, Bohemia. According to the British Air Ministry this morning, Rostock and the Hengel aircraft factory were bombed by a large number of British planes last night. Another squadron of heavy bombers attacked various targets in southern Germany and the Skoda factory in Pilsen. The docks in Dunkirk were also bombed. British fighters attacked German airfields in occupied France at night. The round trip for British planes to attack Pilsen was 1,400 miles. The Skoda factory there is the second-largest armaments factory in Europe, and this was the second time it had been bombed by the British Air Force. The first time was in October 1940, when a small squadron of British planes braved bad weather to attack. Regarding the activities of British and German planes last night, responsible parties stated that the main target of the German planes was the Bath area.</p>

A total of 35 were shot down by Soviet fighters and anti-aircraft guns. The remaining aircraft were scattered, with only a few penetrating the air defense network. The bombs dropped were aimless. Five Soviet aircraft are missing.</p>
<p>Swiss Capital, Havas News Agency - According to military experts, Germany is unlikely to launch a large-scale offensive against the Soviet Union before the end of May or the beginning of June. However, the exact direction of the offensive is still difficult to determine.</p>
<p>Finnish Capital, 25th - Havas News Agency</p>

Despite the ice, snow, and mud, German forces annihilated a large number of enemy troops in the Volkhov area. German forces first cut off the Soviet army's rear communications, capturing a large number of prisoners, seizing 60 artillery pieces, and countless military supplies, in addition to leaving behind 700 Soviet corpses. Clearing the remaining enemy forces in the nearby forests is ongoing. Due to transportation difficulties and heavy casualties, Soviet forces have halted their offensive. In the central sector, German aircraft launched a fierce attack on Soviet artillery positions and formations.</p>
<p>German and Soviet Forces Concentrate on the Front Lines</p>
<p>Swedish Capital, 26th - Havas News Agency - Both the Soviet Union and Germany are actively preparing for a major battle in the future. Large numbers of troops have been continuously deployed and concentrated near the front lines in order to participate in the decisive battle. In the southern sector, the road surfaces are slightly drier than in the central and northern sectors, so the majority of troops are concentrated there. According to Soviet estimates, there are currently about 26 German armored and motorized divisions participating in the Eastern Front. The Red Army is accelerating the transportation of large numbers of reserve troops from Siberia and Central Asia to Europe. For several weeks, the German Air Force has been wantonly bombing Soviet railways, which proves that the Red Army is concentrating large forces. At the same time, the battles in several areas of the front line have gradually become more intense. The Red Army's western vanguard has launched attacks on German forces in the Leningrad, Belorussia, and Smolensk regions. Large-scale battles are also taking place along the Svir River in Finland.</p>

<h3>French Cabinet Decides to Establish Economic Committee; Headed by Romier; Pétain Receives Minister of Food Supply</h3>
<p>Vichy, 25th - Havas News Agency - The Cabinet held its second meeting today, chaired by Chief Laval. It was immediately decided to establish an Economic Committee, headed by Minister Without Portfolio Romier. The food supply issue was the main topic of discussion at today's Cabinet meeting. Minister of Food Supply Le Roy Ladurie and Deputy Minister of Food Supply Bonnathus reported on the difficulties currently being encountered, the most important of which is the bread supply issue, which should be resolved first. Chief Laval also stressed that the bread ration should be maintained at its current level, and that any further reduction would create a crisis, as the national population is already undernourished.</p>
<p>Vichy, 25th - Havas News Agency - The new cabinet convened its second state council meeting at 10:30 this morning to discuss internal affairs. It is reported that almost all the time was spent discussing food supply matters, indicating that the government attaches great importance to this matter. Although the authorities have taken various measures in recent years to increase agricultural production and adjust food distribution, the fact is that the French people are still undernourished. This situation is well known to all parties, and a solution must be found immediately, otherwise the future of the French nation will be unimaginable. Specifically, the British blockade, the lack of domestic labor, the decline in livestock, the activities of the black market, the food requisition by the occupying forces, and even the overly detailed current regulations are all factors that hinder the normal supply of food and make the food shortage even more acute. Since the armistice, a ration system has been implemented for staple foods such as bread, fats, and meat. Under the current circumstances, it is of course impossible to change this system. However, the Vichy press believes that there is room for improvement in the distribution of other essential goods, such as poultry, vegetables, and fresh fruits. According to reliable sources, the government's current plan, while not completely allowing the free flow of all foods, will at least give farmers greater freedom in disposing of their products. In short, the government authorities are currently considering two issues: one is how to increase production, which will take time, and the other is how to unseal the food reserves that the government sealed a year ago. If the latter is implemented, the current ration of food allocated to the people can be appropriately increased. However, the fundamental solution lies in waiting for this year's autumn harvest.</p>
<p>Vichy, 25th - Havas News Agency - Marshal Pétain received Minister of Food Supply Le Roy Ladurie and Chairman of the Farmers' Association Guebryon today and made inquiries.</p>
<h3>Second Group of French Children Arrives in Geneva</h3>

<h3>Turkey Strengthens National Defense; Government to Request Appropriations</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 26th - Havas News Agency - The government will request an appropriation of 30 million Turkish pounds from the next parliament to strengthen border defense.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 26th - Huitong News Agency - The Turkish government has now decided to participate in the International Administrative Conference to be held in Berlin in early May. It is reported that the Turkish delegation will be led by Professor Bacher.</p>
<h3>Norway's Oldest Newspaper, Bergen Evening News, Ceases Publication</h3>

<h3>Addressing the India Problem with Intelligence and Patience; Nehru's Statement; Cripps to Report on Visit to India</h3>
<p>New Delhi, 26th - Reuters - Indian National Congress leader Nehru stated today while meeting with reporters that we do not intend to make representations to the British government, but will do our best to address our problems with intelligence and patience. If Cripps believes that his trip to India has improved the situation, then he is greatly mistaken. Cripps said that we evade responsibility. Such an accusation is truly strange, because the responsibility we seek is actually denied. The British government still speaks in the tone of its pre-war protector, and tries to show the world that it is the arbitrator of India, which surprised me greatly. Nehru expressed surprise at the resolution passed by the Madras Provincial National Congress Legislative Assembly at its meeting the day before, not only about the content of the resolution, but also about the fact that the former Madras Province Prime Minister Charlie used his position as a member of the Standing Committee of the National Congress to preside over the meeting. It is said that this kind of action is inappropriate at any time, and it is especially inappropriate on the eve of the opening of the All-India National Congress Standing Committee. According to reports, the motion put forward by Charlie, which was passed by the Standing Committee of the province, suggested that the All-India National Congress Standing Committee should recognize the Muslim League's demand for the division of India in future constitutional making. The resolution also suggested that the All-India National Congress Standing Committee should invite the Muslim League to discuss in order to reach an agreement and promote the establishment of a national government to deal with the current emergency situation.</p>

<h3>Head of the French Shipping Company Goes to Saigon to Plan Shanghai-Vietnam Navigation Methods; New Far East General Manager Arrives in Haiphong to Inspect the Situation</h3>
<p>International shipping in this city has been completely suspended. Even the small ships flying German and Italian flags on coastal routes have already stopped sailing. Recently, the German merchant ship "Lunhai Fu" has been renamed, and the "Moufou" and "Hana" have similar plans. The various situations have been reported in previous newspapers.</p>
<p>Efforts are Being Made to Open Navigation Routes</p>
<p>Efforts are still being made to open the Shanghai-Vietnam route. However, due to the increasing Pacific War, it has not been possible to open the route temporarily. In addition, the manager of the Saigon head office was arrested due to certain circumstances, and the position of Far East General Manager is vacant. The Marseilles head office ordered the manager of the French Shipping Company in this city to take on the position concurrently. The manager took the S.S. G.G.A. Varenne to Saigon to take over the position of Far East General Manager and to proceed with opening the Shanghai-Vietnam route. It is reported that the ship has now arrived in Haiphong. The manager is inspecting the branch office in Haiphong, and will take the original ship to Saigon in a few days. If the negotiations are successful, the Shanghai-Vietnam route can be successfully opened in the future.</p>
<h3>Purchasing Opium for Medical Use Exposed; Hospital Director Flees</h3>
<p>Gao Mouming, director of the Jisheng Hospital at No. 1 Card Road, Xiangfuli, ordered trainee Yu Jianrong (15 years old) to purchase opium in the southern city for medical use. However, yesterday at around 5 p.m., Yu was apprehended by Chinese police when he passed the iron gate of Dongxinqiao Street. He was taken to the police station and confessed that Gao was the instigator. The police went to arrest Gao, but he had already fled upon hearing the news. The police chief ordered Yu to be detained pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>Rice Sales to Be Supervised by Police Chiefs</h3>
<p>It has been heard that the French Concession Authority, in order to prevent unfortunate incidents from occurring to rice buyers, has instructed the police chiefs of each police station to personally inspect the rice stores on the days when rice is sold to prevent all disputes.</p>
<p>Cheap Coal Supply Unreliable, Water Prices Rise Again; Cooked Water Shops Close Down</p>
<p>More than 540 cooked water shops in this city were able to barely maintain their operations because they purchased cheap coal dust for cooking water. However, since December 8th of last year, the Kai'ao Mining Bureau has stopped operations in reality. The supply of cheap coal dust has also stopped. The cooked water shops have switched to purchasing commercial coal dust, which has posed a serious threat to their operations for several months. Moreover, these businesses are all small-scale. Now that the water company is also increasing its prices, the businesses are unable to maintain their operations. More than a dozen have been forced to close down one after another. The closure of cooked water shops has a significant impact on social problems. Currently, the industry association is still actively seeking to continue selling cheap coal dust and other important issues, and hopes that the relevant authorities will provide assistance.</p>
<h3>Passengers Departing Shanghai for Ningbo Find Ferry Transfer Troublesome; Hope for Direct Boarding on the Bund</h3>
<p>The Dongya Shipping Company's Changshan Maru departed from Taikoo Wharf on the afternoon of the 21st of this month and arrived safely at the Jiangbei coast of Ningbo around noon the next day. After unloading passengers and cargo, it handled the return voyage. The ship has now returned to Shanghai and is scheduled to depart for Ningbo for the sixth time yesterday at noon. The ship is very crowded on each trip. The reason for this is that passengers parked at Taikoo Wharf do not need to use small ferries for transfer, and can directly board the ship. Therefore, passengers going to Ningbo are willing to take this ship to avoid twists and turns. Recently, there have been many people returning to Ningbo from Shanghai. However, due to the lack of convenient transportation, people from the same village urgently hope that the relevant authorities will find ways to improve it, so that traveling back and forth can benefit all. For example, Hualin, Haitong, Wanjin, and others are usually parked at the Yangshupu Yangzi Wharf, and the transfer from the Bund by small ferry is troublesome. Passengers hope that the above-mentioned ships can be changed to moor near the Bund to facilitate boarding and avoid the labor of transferring by ferry.</p>
<h3>Group Returnees Numbering Over Two Hundred Can Apply for Sponsorship; Efforts to Secure Shipping Cabin Space at Half Price; Various Organizations Continue to Issue Return Certificates</h3>
<p>Although yesterday was Sunday, the Shanghai Municipal Council's office for issuing return permits and its various sub-offices still issued return permits as usual. The number of applicants was quite large. Starting on May 1st, although the office and its various sub-offices stopped issuing half-price tickets, they still issued return permits as usual. The hometown associations and social organizations entrusted to issue return permits also continued to issue permits to facilitate those applying to return to their hometowns.</p>
<p>Hubei Villagers Group Registration</p>
<p>The Chinese Evacuation Association has requested 200 half-price cabin spaces from the Dongya Shipping Company for a commercial ship that will sail to Hankou tomorrow or the day after, in order to reduce the burden on Hubei villagers and facilitate evacuation. Hubei villagers who do not need to stay in Shanghai can apply to the Hubei Shanghai Villagers Association to board. Do not miss this good opportunity.</p>
<p>Future Application Can Be Made by Imitation</p>
<p>In the future, if there are people leaving Shanghai to return to their hometowns in the same destination, such as those over two hundred people, they can request the Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Evacuation Association to transfer to the authorities requesting ships to reserve half-price seats, and get a group to take care of each other, but also to lighten travel expenses.</p>
<p>Special Report by This Newspaper</p>
<h3>Showing the Severity of Living Problems from the Cost of Living Index: An Eighteen-Fold Increase Compared to Five Years Ago, Rickshaws Now Classified as Luxury Items</h3>
<p>The soaring cost of living in Shanghai in recent years is unprecedented. All residents, except for the wealthy, lament the difficulty of making ends meet. Ordinary citizens relying on low wages live in constant worry. Employers often claim that salaries have increased several times over, implying generosity and blaming individuals for not being thrifty. However, in reality, the increase in wages cannot keep up with the skyrocketing prices, like a tortoise trying to outrun a hare. Ordinary citizens are like swallowing Coptis chinensis – they have bitterness they cannot express, struggling to support even their wives and children. Helplessly, they scatter their families back to their hometowns (assuming there is still a home), while they remain in Shanghai to struggle. Even if they are mocked by relatives and neighbors for returning empty-handed after years in the "land of gold," Shanghai, they cannot afford to care.</p>
<p>New Cost of Living Index Reaches a Peak Again</p>
<p>The upward trend of living expenses in Shanghai roughly began at the end of the lunar year before the last and has continued relentlessly. In recent months, the situation has changed dramatically, with the price increases being even more shocking, to the point where ordinary citizens can barely survive. Even with rapid salary adjustments, it is not enough. This can be clearly seen from the figures released by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Statistics Office. The new cost of living index for Chinese workers in Shanghai for March of this year, published in the Municipal Council Gazette on the 24th of this month, reached a new peak of 1781.60. This is calculated with the 1936 cost of living index set at 100, showing an increase of 30.67% compared to February. It is clear that the current cost of living index has increased approximately 18 times compared to 1936, meaning that one yuan today is only worth 5.61 fen in 1936. The cost of living index for Western salaried employees is 791.46, an increase of 24.08% compared to 782.95 in February, with one yuan being worth 10.29%. (Note: The Municipal Council's published salary index for Westerners also uses 1936 as the base for comparison.)</p>
<p>A Hundred Yuan in Your Pocket Now Only Worth Five and a Half Yuan</p>
<p>In short, these figures indicate that if you had 100 yuan in your pocket six years ago, you now only have five and a half yuan. The remaining 94.5 yuan has been lost invisibly due to the high cost of living. For foreigners, 90 yuan has been lost invisibly. However, this is based on the situation in March. If calculated based on today's new peak in prices, the index has risen at least another 30% compared to March. A detailed analysis of the cost of living index is provided below.</p>
<p>First, let's consider Chinese workers. The average household unit has 5.02 people, accounting for 4.4 consumer units. The proportion of household income is 66.20% from the main wage earner, 23.29% from other family members, and 10.51% from other household income. If the entire household earned 100 yuan in 1936, they now only earn 405 yuan, with the lowest earning only 343 yuan. Comparing this figure with the expenditure table shows that the goods this household unit can now afford for living are only one-fifth of what they could afford six years ago. If this household wants to maintain the same standard of living as before, they must earn approximately 1,800 yuan per month. However, the current average actual earnings are only 373 yuan, so how can they not be struggling?</p>
<p>The largest item of living expenses is "food." Rangoon rice sells for 223.464 yuan per picul (currently selling for 290 yuan). In 1936, it only sold for 9.735 yuan. Moreover, the rice priced at 223.464 yuan per picul is of very low quality. The rice price in the free market is about double that amount. The second largest expense is "housing." Current rent is six times higher than in 1936. Landlords receive little of it, with most of it going into the hands of second landlords. They are solely profit-driven, openly defying regulations prohibiting rent increases, repeatedly using excuses to raise rents, disregarding the benevolent intentions of the lawmakers. The social saying "Landlords should not oppress the poor" has long been completely destroyed. Other expenses, such as electricity, are less under the management of municipal authorities. Clothing is 15 times more expensive than in 1936, and fuel is about 20 to 40 times more expensive.</p>
<p>Foreigners Also Experiencing Financial Difficulties</p>
<p>As for the cost of living index for foreigners, a simplified table is listed below: (Based on the average index of 100 in 1936 for comparison)</p>
<p>The rate of increase in food in March compared to 1936 was 11 times for American residents, 13 times for British residents, 16 times for Russian residents, and 14.5 times for other foreign residents. Rent was 6 and 1/3 times for American residents, 6 and 1/5 times for British residents, 6 and 2/3 times for Russian residents, and 5 and 2/3 times for other foreign residents. Clothing was 11 and 1/3 times for American residents, 11.5 times for British residents, 11 times for Russian residents, and 11.5 times for other foreign residents. Miscellaneous items were 5 and 2/3 times for American residents, 5 and 1/4 times for British residents, 6 times for Russian residents, and 6 and 1/3 times for other foreign residents. Looking at the numbers above, the expenses for rent and miscellaneous items are lower than those for food and clothing. Rent is subject to some control, but most of the rent is still earned by second landlords. Miscellaneous items include public transportation, trams, and telephone fees, which are also subject to strict control by municipal authorities. At least rickshaws are now classified as luxury goods and are not included in these calculations.</p>
<p>Medium Living Expenses Require Over 2,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The numbers listed above are all based on those published by the Municipal Council. A further analysis of the living expenses of middle-class Chinese and foreign citizens is provided below:</p>
<p>Chinese family, calculated for ten people, March 1942</p>
<p>Food: 1,500 yuan</p>
<p>Housing: 300 yuan</p>
<p>Clothing: 300 yuan</p>
<p>Miscellaneous: 200 yuan</p>
<p>Entertainment: 200 yuan</p>
<p>Total: 2,500 yuan</p>
<p>(April may increase by 30% compared to this number)</p>
<p>Foreign family, calculated for five people, March 1942</p>
<p>Food: 1,200 yuan</p>
<p>Housing: 600 yuan</p>
<p>Clothing: 1,200 yuan</p>
<p>Miscellaneous: 600 yuan</p>
<p>Entertainment: 400 yuan</p>
<p>Total: 4,000 yuan</p>
<p>(April may increase by 30% compared to this number)</p>
<p>In the past, the cost of living index was rarely noticed except by those who studied it, because life was stable, and the index fluctuated very little, making it seem uninteresting. But today, it is a matter of personal survival, and ordinary citizens will carefully examine the cost of living index. Therefore, this article with its lengthy statistics may still arouse the interest of readers. However, wealthy people, through successful hoarding and speculation, accumulate more and more capital, and the rising cost of living does not affect them. No matter how much the cost of living index increases, it seems to have nothing to do with them. Only the vast majority of ordinary people suffer, lacking both capital and assistance. They can only allow the burden of living to become heavier and heavier. Unable to cope, those who commit suicide and those who freeze to death on the roadside are everywhere. Ordinary people are innocent; it seems they should not be subjected to such cruel treatment!</p>
<h3>Low Pressure Hits Shanghai, Climate Changes, West Wind Blows Furiously, Showers Pour Down, Weather Expected to Stabilize Today</h3>
<p>The weather in this city suddenly changed yesterday. The west wind roared, showers poured down, and clouds leaped and swirled all day as the atmospheric pressure dropped. The Universal News Agency reporter records the following:</p>
<p>Wind and Rain Together</p>
<p>The weather in this city has been unsettled with alternating sunshine and rain in recent days, but the atmospheric pressure has been stable. Starting yesterday morning, the weather suddenly changed. The west wind blew furiously, with a force of over three. Dense layered clouds gathered and leaped threateningly. At 10:00 AM, a sudden shower fell, lasting for half an hour before stopping. The weather was unstable in the afternoon with alternating sunshine and rain. At 5:00 PM in the evening, thunderstorms continued.</p>
<p>Low Pressure Leaves the Sea</p>
<p>Yesterday's strong winds and heavy rain seemed to be affected by a low-pressure system moving towards Shanghai from the Yangtze River basin. It is generally expected that it will pass over Shanghai and out to sea last night, and the wind is expected to stabilize today. However, whether it will clear up is difficult to say.</p>
<h3>Rice Shops in Both Concessions to Collect Corn Sales Permits Today</h3>
<p>Although yesterday was Sunday, the warehouses designated by the Municipal Council's Grain Office to extract rice from Jardine Matheson's, Zhejiang Xingye's, Huishan's, Roosevelt's, and other wharves were open as usual to allow rice shops to extract rice. However, it has not been fully extracted, so the door-to-door sales situation today will not be as widespread as on Wednesday. Today, following the usual practice, they will collect sales permits from the Municipal Council's Grain Management Committee and then pay at the Grain Office. Starting tomorrow, they will begin extracting corn from Lihe Warehouse at 195 Suzhou Road. This corn has been ground into coarse grains and will be widely available for sale on Friday. The time for rice shops to sell rice will continue to be extended.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Dredging Bureau Invites Bids for Machine Oil and Cleaning Materials</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Dredging Bureau announced that it is now inviting bids for "water-based fuel oil," machine oil, cleaning materials, tools, and miscellaneous materials, to be delivered according to the Bureau's instructions. All details and lists can be obtained from the Luogong Section of the Bureau on the 5th floor of the Jianghai Customs (special attention should be paid to the first item on the list). Bids must be sealed securely, with the words "Bid for Materials" written on the outside. The letter should also state the manufacturers of each item and must be delivered before noon on May 1st of this year. When bids are opened in the future, the Bureau is not bound by the lowest or any bid and may assign the contract to any bidder.</p>
<h3>Protecting Rice Transportation Organizations, Intercepting Rice Along the Way, The Incident of Rice Trucks Collapsing in the Yunhui District Being Intercepted Due to the Issue of Increasing Protection Fees</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council issues foreign rice to each rice shop on Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday every week. Recently, the transportation of this foreign rice in the Yunhui District north of the Bund has been contracted to the Huatai Transportation Company of Yunnan Road. During the designated period, the rice is loaded and shipped from each warehouse, and the collapsers are given armbands as proof to pass through.</p>
<p>Huatai Company's Rice Truck Crosses the Bridge</p>
<p>On the afternoon of March 20, Huatai Company's collapsers Xu Guohong, Wang Yi, and others, a total of ten people, loaded a large amount of foreign rice from a certain warehouse to supply the people for purchase the next day, Saturday. When they passed North Suzhou Road, they were surrounded by several strong men upon the order of Shi Changfa, the Jiangbei manager of the Shuangyi Company at No. 49 nearby.</p>
<p>Municipal Council-Issued Armbands Also Robbed</p>
<p>Claiming that the Municipal Council armbands worn by you collapsers are forged and cannot transport foreign rice, they forcibly removed them and took them away. The workers were greatly shocked and reported it to the shareholder and manager of the local area, Cui Conglai, who went to negotiate with Shi Changfa. In fact, Shuangyi Company specializes in protecting the transportation of Municipal Council's foreign rice to prevent starving people from robbing it along the way. Initially, Huatai Company was willing to pay a fee of one and a half cents per bag.</p>
<p>Demanding a Protection Fee of One Dime Per Bag</p>
<p>Since the 16th of last month, they wanted to increase the price to one dime. All foreign rice vehicles passing through the North Suzhou River Wharf, except those of Huatai Company, were treated in the same way. These people are quite influential, taking this protection fee. Otherwise, the rice trucks loaded along the way are at risk of being robbed by bandits and starving people. Cui Conglai was very dissatisfied with Shi Changfa of Shuangyi Company and secretly reported it to the Yunhui Police Station. After the West Detective and senior Chinese officers rushed to Shuangyi Company to investigate,</p>
<p>The Bureau Sues for Obstructing Rice Transport</p>
<p>The company manager Shi Changfa, as well as the suspects Jiangbei resident Jiang Agen and Ding Jinfa, who forcibly took the armbands of the collapsers at the North Suzhou River Wharf at that time, were taken to the police station and prosecuted for obstructing the transport of grain and fraud under Article 250, Paragraph 1, of the Criminal Law. According to Cui Conglai, shareholder and manager of Huatai Transportation Company, the defendant Shi Changfa is quite intimidating in the North Suzhou River Wharf area. According to Shi's testimony, he did not forcibly increase a fixed protection fee and hired a lawyer to defend him. The other defendants all denied participating in the forced seizure of the armbands issued by the Municipal Council to the collapsers.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Passengers Robbed on the Bund</h3>
<p>Near the Bund of Nanjing Road, at about 5:30 PM yesterday, eight unarmed bandits intercepted a passenger on a rickshaw and forcibly robbed him of 150 yuan in legal tender and 1 yuan in Japanese currency.</p>

<h3>University Students Covet Wealth, Kidnap Classmates for Ransom, Handcuffs and Black Glasses Found, Another Perpetrator Arrested Yesterday</h3>
<p>Fujian youths Huang Wei (23 years old, residing at 136 Avenue Lafayette) and Yu Bo (22 years old) are both students at Guanghua University. They had a classmate, Chen Wenyuan (26 years old, from Xiamen), whose father was a businessman in Southeast Asia. As remittances had not arrived for a long time, they developed malicious intentions. Learning that Huang Wei's father held an important position in the city's banking industry and possessed a large fortune, they falsely claimed to invite Huang and Yu to watch a movie and invited them to his residence at 26 Wanyi Fang, Luban Road, for a chat. At the same time, they gathered five or six ruffians, who rushed into the room and kidnapped Huang and Yu. They sent a letter to Huang's father demanding a large sum of money. The plan was not secret and was discovered by the French police. They dispatched detectives to arrest Chen and rescue Huang and Yu, confiscating a pair of handcuffs and two pairs of sunglasses. However, accomplices were at large. Yesterday, upon receiving a report from an informant, Xiamen youth Yang Yuxing (25 years old) was also arrested in connection with the case. The police are currently investigating and will prosecute them for kidnapping for ransom once the investigation is complete.</p>
<h3>Embezzling Flour by Taking Advantage of Position, One Year Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Punishing One to Warn a Hundred, Eliminating Malpractices</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office announced that "Zhou Shihai, chairman of the Shanghai Big Pancake and Fried Dough Stick Industry Association at 221 Changping Road, was sentenced to one year of imprisonment by the Shanghai First Special District Local Court on the 23rd of this month for the crime of fraud and breach of trust. The reason is that the Municipal Council's controlled food supply aims to ensure that the public can obtain a continuous supply and not be cut off. Therefore, it handled the registration of genuine flour users for allocation purposes. Before the registration was completed, the Bureau had no choice but to distribute a large batch of flour to its members through the association formed by the users. Zhou held the position of Chairman of the Big Pancake and Fried Dough Stick Industry</p>
<p>Association.</p>
<p>He should have forwarded the application forms submitted by the members of the association to the Municipal Council for verification and allocation. Unexpectedly, a large part of the application forms submitted by Zhou were forged. Not only were the addresses filled in fictitious, but the chops affixed were also counterfeit. He sold the batch of flour he embezzled on the black market, making a huge profit. This behavior not only constituted the crime of fraud against the Municipal Council, but also violated the trust placed in him by the members of the association who supplied the public with big pancakes, fried dough sticks, and other staple foods.</p>
<p>All of Zhou's actions were subsequently discovered, and he was arrested by the police. On the 2nd of this month, he was prosecuted in the First Special District Court on the aforementioned two charges. After being detained for questioning twice, and during detention pending trial, more conclusive evidence was discovered. The court then sentenced him to imprisonment according to the law. It is believed that Zhou and others who sabotage the flour control have been sentenced to one year in prison, which not only vents public anger and is deeply gratifying, but also punishes one to warn a hundred, so that those who attempt to sabotage the mechanisms set up by the Municipal Council to cope with the current emergency situation will have a lesson to learn from the past. The Bureau has now carefully studied and improved the procedures for applying for the supply of flour and other items, so that all possible malpractices can be eliminated, and the goal of maintaining the reserve of staple foods and distributing them fairly will not be sabotaged again."</p>
<h3>Two Authorities Continue to Discover Stores Exceeding Price Limits, Strictly Punishing Them According to the Law</h3>
<p>The Price Management Committees of the two concessions spare no effort in suppressing the prices of various goods. In recent days, they have dispatched honest and knowledgeable personnel to inspect the city areas and strictly monitor the sales of goods and the level of prices in commercial firms. In the last ten days, several merchants have been found by investigators from the two concessions to have violated price limits and regulations. Most of them sell inferior goods at limited prices. After being discovered, their business licenses are revoked, and they are closed for several days or fined as punishment.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Driver Sentenced to Seven Years in Lei Yunsheng's Young Master Kidnapping Case</h3>
<p>Teng Wenjin, a former driver of the Addo Road French Car Company, was arrested by the French police for his involvement in the kidnapping of the young master of Lei Yunsheng Pharmacy and prosecuted for kidnapping for ransom. He was recently sentenced to seven years of imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Dr. Lee Shuiyenga Hosts Leprosy Patient Shelter, Lifetime Incurable Diseases Separated from the Outside World, Self-Sufficiently Like Another World</h3>
<p>In a sparsely populated area on the outskirts of Shanghai, there is a leprosy patient shelter. The shelter is surrounded by a bamboo fence, and it houses hundreds of leprosy patients. The oldest is sixty years old, and the youngest is less than twelve years old. Although life is peaceful, they suffer from a terrible disease, and their pain is something that others cannot understand. It is truly pitiful. Moreover, there are more than just these leprosy patients in Shanghai. There are also some who are self-employed and suffer from this disease. Because they are still in the early stages, they do not pose a threat to society. Their presence can often be seen among the bustling crowds on the streets.</p>
<p>Leprosy Phenomenon</p>
<p>The leprosy patient shelter mentioned in this article is located between two roads near Wujiaochang on Bailinan Road. The severity of the patients' illness varies. Some are blind in both eyes, some have half their bodies numb, some have incomplete arms and legs, and some have lost all ten fingers. All of these are caused by the unfortunate suffering from leprosy. Patients do not want to bring shame on others, so they often deny that the disease is hereditary.</p>
<p>Millions of Patients</p>
<p>Leprosy has been found in China for thousands of years. It is rarely found in Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, and other provinces, but there are many patients in other regions, accounting for as much as 1% of the population. Dr. Lee Shuiyenga, the world-renowned American leprosy authority, estimates that there are over one million leprosy patients in China.</p>
<p>Resigned to Fate</p>
<p>The leprosy patient shelter on Bailinan Road was established by Dr. Lee. The thatched houses provide temporary shelter for sick men, women, old people, and children. These poor wretches have little hope of being cured. Although science is increasingly advancing, unfortunately, it has not yet fully resolved this problem. This disease is a chronic skin disease, causing ulcers and spots, dead wood of fibers, and scaly appearance. Few are fortunate enough to be cured. The patients in the shelter know that there is no hope for them, but they still work hard in this secluded place that outsiders dare not enter, doing housework such as cooking and tailoring. They are completely unaware of the changes in the outside world, resigned to fate and no longer harboring extravagant hopes of going outside.</p>
<p>Withdrawing from the Battlefront</p>
<p>Before the Shanghai war in 1937, these people originally lived in the leprosy hospital near Shanghai. The hospital was large-scale, rare in China, and equipped with new facilities and all kinds of conveniences. Unfortunately, it was destroyed by artillery fire. It would cost a lot to repair it. The patients fled in panic to Shanghai. At that time, Dr. Lee sent food to the patients in the increasingly dangerous area, braving the rain of bullets. The authorities knew that Dr. Lee valued the welfare of the patients in the hospital more than his own life and had sent officers to visit and understand the patients' need for care. Therefore, they uniquely allowed him to pass through the military line.</p>
<p>Panicked Arrival in Shanghai</p>
<p>As the war intensified, it was absolutely necessary to relocate the patients. Dr. Lee also received the final notice from the authorities, stipulating the date for the patients' relocation. If they delayed, the consequences would be unimaginable. The sides of the hospital were already being hit by artillery shells, and the sick women were also in danger. Dr. Lee urgently dispatched two of the most frightening-looking patients to guard the entrance of the hospital, which would deter anyone from approaching. At the same time, he worked hard to find a solution and finally made an urgent appeal to the Municipal Council, asking for permission for the patients to pass through the Public Concession. The Bureau agreed, but on the condition that the patients be isolated from the residents when they were sent into the city.</p>
<p>Dangerous Journey</p>
<p>With the matter settled, Dr. Lee led the patients through the Public Concession. Along the way, soldiers and marines stood guard with rifles and bayonets. The journey was about a mile long. Even those with extremely dangerous illnesses had no cars to ride in, so patients constantly collapsed along the way and had to be carried. At that time, there were still two old people in the hospital who were not leprosy patients and preferred to stay in the hospital and die. However, the patients could not bear to leave them alone and finally took them to a safe place. The patients' destination was the Jessfield District. After arriving in the shared land, they built bamboo fences and thatched huts to temporarily live in, and they still live there today. Dr. Lee, who rescued them, has never left them, striving to improve their welfare.</p>
<p>Religious Beliefs</p>
<p>The patients in the shelter are all devout Christians, with an unusually deep religious belief. Another house was built as a church, with a cross placed on the door. The preacher is a 53-year-old patient, who is also in charge of the finances of the shelter, assisting Dr. Lee in managing the budget, and is highly respected. Men engage in carpentry, shoemaking, and weaving, while women are responsible for sewing and cleaning. Children are taught ordinary school lessons by older patients. Many patients are educated and can speak English.</p>
<p>Self-Sufficient</p>
<p>The wooden utensils, clothing, shoes, etc., made by the patients are thoroughly disinfected before being taken to the city for sale. Purchasers do not need to worry about infection. The proceeds from the sales are used to cover the maintenance costs of the shelter, and the rest is given to the patients for their own use. One patient also runs a pastry and candy business, selling to fellow patients in the shelter. However, due to the current worsening situation, it is no longer possible to continue the business. The preaching pastor in the shelter comes from a church in South China and was ordained just a few years ago. Unfortunately, he contracted this terrible disease. Knowing that he had no hope of recovery, he devoted his life to providing religious assistance to others in the same shelter. The church also has a choir, but due to limited funds, they do not have clean choir costumes. In addition, there are professional artists in the shelter who create colorful portrait paintings for others, working tirelessly.</p>
<p>Others may think that leprosy patients must all be confined to the Bailinan Road shelter, but this is not the case. They can leave the shelter at any time. There are no laws in Shanghai prohibiting leprosy patients from coming and going. However, these people are used to staying in the shelter together and do not leave their close friend, Dr. Lee.</p>
<p>Patients Outside the Shelter</p>
<p>Dr. Lee also runs a leprosy clinic on Carter Road, providing treatment for about 400 leprosy patients outside the shelter. Once or twice a week, he injects Chaulmoogra oil, free of charge for the poor, preventing the spread of leprosy bacteria. This oil is considered the best.</p>
<p>No Need to Worry About Infection</p>
<p>According to Dr. Lee, leprosy is not as easily transmitted as tuberculosis. Breathing in the air exhaled by tuberculosis patients may transmit tuberculosis bacteria, but even with frequent contact with leprosy patients, one can remain unaffected. He has been living with leprosy patients for twenty years and has still not contracted the disease. Shanghai itself does not have many leprosy patients. Most of the patients in the shelter come from the areas surrounding Shanghai, and some are sent in by the municipal authorities, with the costs borne by the authorities.</p>
<p>Morning Light Monthly</p>
<p>The conditions in the shelter are now very different from the past. Dr. Lee is racking his brains to provide the patients with three meals a day. Production work has also been close to a standstill due to a lack of materials. However, the patients do not seek leisure and still publish a monthly magazine, all handwritten. Whenever they see tourists, they show it to them. The booklet is titled "Morning Light," as if symbolizing their pursuit of light.</p>
<p>Huang Huanyu's Painting Exhibition</p>
<p>The famous painter Huang Huanyu returned to China last autumn, and his painting exhibition was unprecedentedly grand, causing a sensation in Shanghai. He originally planned to travel abroad again, but due to inconvenient transportation, he stayed in Shanghai, closed his doors to create, and collected more than 200 of his recent masterpieces. It is scheduled to be publicly displayed for seven days at the Daxin Company Art Gallery from April 27th to May 3rd. It is expected that it will cause a sensation in Shanghai at that time.</p>

<h3>The Study of the Treatment of Epidemic Febrile Disease</h3>
<p>Physician Hu Qipeng wrote an article for this newspaper entitled "Epidemic Febrile Disease in Shanghai," which is of great benefit to human health and of particular concern to the medical community. We have repeatedly received inquiries and requests for discussion from various sectors. We are now publishing a letter from Mr. Nie Yuntai. If Dr. Hu's article can lead to more advanced and effective treatments for epidemic fever, the improvement to public welfare would be far from insignificant.</p>
<p>Nie Yuntai Describes Treatment Situation: To Dr. Hu, with great respect. I have recently read your esteemed work "Epidemic Febrile Disease in Shanghai," which lists the statistics of various diseases over five years. I am filled with admiration. I have been researching this issue for several years and previously obtained statistical figures from the Public Concession Health Department for the past two years. I was about to write for the statistical figures for the year before last and last year, but now having read your work, I understand them clearly. However, I would like to inquire whether the term "typhoid fever" includes paratyphoid fever. Is the mortality rate of paratyphoid fever also high? There are four types of paratyphoid fever: A, B, C, and D. The Pasteur Institute in the French Concession differentiates between these four types. I wonder if the health departments in the Public Concession or the French Concession also have separate statistics? If you have any relevant information, please provide it for my reference. Based on scientific pathology, I have used traditional Chinese medicines with antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects to create a highly effective drug for various types of enteritis, including acute enteritis (including bacillary dysentery, with seven chemical tests confirming its effectiveness). Over the past four years, it has cured many cases of typhoid fever with high fever lasting ten to twenty days, often within a few days. Recently, I cured one case of paratyphoid fever that had been treated unsuccessfully with conventional medicine by Dr. Wang Xingtao, who provided an English letter as proof, and there are also proofs from other physicians. Our methods are completely open, and the medicine is also provided free of charge. I will provide more details later. I have two versions of my highly effective typhoid fever medicine, from the 28th and 30th years of the Republic. I will present you with a newly published version when it is available. Nie Yuntai, April 25.</p>
<p>Qin Chongren Provides Free Clinic: To provide relief to the poor and sick, starting today, the hours of 2 PM to 4 PM daily will be designated for free consultations. Acupuncture for all ailments is completely free. If medicine is needed, this clinic has effective pills and powders available for free distribution. Clinic address: No. 18, Yanjili, north of Old Rubbish Bridge. Telephone: 41190. Sincerely, Physician Qin Chongren.</p>

<h3>West Youth Volleyball League Schedule Announced This Week: French Police Play Giants Tonight</h3>
<p>The 14th West Youth Volleyball Invitational Tournament will begin tonight at 6:20 PM, featuring two matches in Group B and one women's invitational exhibition match, held at the YMCA gymnasium on Jing'an Temple Road. In the first match, the French Police will face the Giants. The former has considerable strength and has remained undefeated since the start of the tournament. The latter relies on the height of several players, but their skills are ordinary, and they may find it difficult to blunt the French Police's attack. In the second match, Peide will face Monocle. The two teams are evenly matched in terms of strength. Peide has had bad luck with volleyball and has been defeated repeatedly. Monocle has played fewer matches, but their strategies are narrow and lack elegance. The outcome is difficult to predict. Tickets are priced at two yuan. On Wednesday, the 29th, there will be two matches in Group B and the Russian Overseas Chinese team will play the Soviet team in Group A. The schedule for this week is listed below:</p>

<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>A Record of the Gastroenterology Exhibition at the Aurora Museum</h3>
<p>The gastroenterology exhibition is displayed at the Aurora Museum on Route Père Robert near Rue Paul Henry, and was created by Dr. Song Daren to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the founding of the Shanghai Gastroenterology Hospital. It has been open for many days, and the reporter took time to visit it yesterday. The venue was very crowded with viewers, either looking up or looking down, all holding their breath and paying attention to what they wanted to see. The reporter toured for a week and unknowingly spent three or four hours there. The main points are summarized below for the reference of future visitors.</p>
<p>Specimens and Models Are Rare</p>
<p>The exhibited materials all have detailed explanations, including specimens and models: such as pathological specimens of gastrointestinal diseases preserved in solution, which are diseased parts that have been surgically removed and treated with chemical solutions, and then placed in specimen bottles. The Chinese people attach great importance to the remains, and dare not damage even the slightest hair or skin. Therefore, the source of these specimens is very difficult to obtain, and even hospitals abroad cannot fully equip themselves. Even with great financial resources, it is not easy to do so. It is said that the exhibitor has been planning this for a long time, and has also sought them from thousands of miles away. Pathological models of gastrointestinal diseases; pathological tissue specimens of gastrointestinal diseases; were all personally supervised by specially hired technicians together with the staff of the Shanghai Digestive Disease Research Institute. Although there are a few ready-made ones for sale in the market, they may not be accurate. The Shanghai Digestive Disease Research Institute is an academic group specializing in the study of gastrointestinal diseases, located on Fuxu Road in the French Concession.</p>
<p>Chinese Medicine Specimens in Natural Colors</p>
<p>There are more than 100 kinds of Chinese medicine specimens for gastrointestinal diseases, all of which have been proven to have good therapeutic effects. When they were fresh, they were filmed and transmitted in natural color, and the medicinal parts were placed in specimen boxes for easy viewing and are very beautiful. Secondly, there are atlases of digestive diseases: drawings of digestive diseases; and explanations of gastrointestinal diseases, etc.: The atlases of pathology refer to the exquisite books of various countries, or are borrowed from the collections of major hospitals, totaling six or seven hundred pieces. The pathological drawings are based on the experience gained over the past five years, and are truthfully written. Those that cannot be shown in atlases are explained in tables. This kind of material took a long time, and cannot be completed in a hurry. Dr. Song's meticulousness is extraordinary, and he is not sloppy in the slightest. Therefore, the busyness of his clinical work and the happiness of his patients are not accidental.</p>
<p>Novel Instruments and Clear Photography</p>
<p>Diagnosis and treatment techniques: such as gastroscope; color diagrams of gastroscope; slides; illustrated explanations of gastrointestinal disease examination methods, etc.: These are the latest tools for treatment. By viewing these, one can understand the basics of gastrointestinal diseases. Since the stomach is deeply hidden in the abdominal cavity, how can the naked eye see through it? Only novel instruments can solve this difficulty. The gastroscope can not only explore all the conditions of the stomach, whether diseased or not, but also reflect it on the outside and can be photographed. Doctors and patients can review it, and there is no risk of ambiguity. The color diagrams are based on realistic photography, and the colors are set according to the original state, whether diseased or not, and are no different from real organs.</p>
<p>Parasites and Insecticides</p>
<p>Regarding parasites: there are diagrams of the life history of human parasites; preserved specimens of human parasites; tissue sections of human parasites (with electric light device, exquisitely bright and convenient to view); Chinese and foreign insecticides, etc.; parasites have a great impact on human health, and there are many kinds of them. Ordinary people do not know the fear of human parasites, and naturally neglect prevention. Therefore, people with stomach diseases are everywhere. Now, by looking at the life history diagrams, one should also be alert.</p>
<p>Rich Collection of Literature</p>
<p>As for the literature: there is a review of ancient and modern digestive organs, which is based on the evolution of academic knowledge, from rough and rudimentary to detailed and precise. Song's Chinese and English history of digestive diseases in China is very detailed. In addition, there is a Chinese catalog of digestive diseases in the past 30 years; an index of articles on digestive diseases in the world; and an index of books on digestive diseases in the world. This kind of work seems easy but is actually difficult. On the one hand, it cannot be completed in a short period of time. On the other hand, it requires extensive knowledge of international literature, and its contribution to the academic community is huge. Regarding compilation: such as a compilation of famous doctors' case studies from past dynasties; a collection of prescriptions for gastrointestinal diseases from Chinese and foreign doctors in Shanghai; a compilation of Danfang; a compilation of Wan San Gao Dan; and an index of Chinese and foreign drug preparations for digestive diseases; are all of great interest for the reference of specialists. The statistics table of the Shanghai Gastroenterology Hospital is a classified statistic of the results accumulated over the past five years, and is also a rare material.</p>
<p>Hai Xu Lou's Valuable Writings</p>
<p>Writings: divided into series and papers. The gastrointestinal disease series has published "Diet Guide" and "A Treatise on Liver and Stomach Qi Pain," and there are still seven or eight kinds of manuscripts waiting to be printed. Papers have been published in various medical journals, and about a dozen copies have been printed. More than 20 unpublished ones. Song's Hai Xu Lou collection contains about a dozen rare and precious books on gastrointestinal diseases, all of which are displayed in glass cabinets. Reference books: hundreds of specialized magazines in Chinese, French, German, English, Japanese, and American languages. The number is also very considerable. This kind of exhibition is not easy to see in Shanghai, and is very valuable. Especially for those who have gastrointestinal diseases, nine out of ten people have them, because everyone eats and drinks. Most diseases enter through the mouth. With such a good event, how can one miss it?</p>
<p>Exhibits Are All Insured</p>
<p>It is heard that all the exhibits are insured by a major insurance company because of their excessive value, and the premiums paid are also quite a lot. When French Consul General Ma visited, he deeply admired Dr. Song's academic achievements because of his rich and meticulous exhibits. He went to shake hands with him and was very happy. The exhibition will last until May 11, from 1:30 PM to 5:00 PM every day. At the same time, you can visit the upper and lower floors of the museum, various rare and ancient objects and rare animals, and there are real beehive and ant nests in huge glass installations, with a torch reflecting light, so you can directly see their life and work. It is also a spectacle.</p>

<p>Economic Special</p>
<h3>Investment and Speculation Are Confusing: Chinese Stocks Are a Focus for Floating Capital</h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese stock market was vibrant last week. The reason for this is that the soaring price of yarn, the sudden surge in the gold market, and the continued rise in foreign stocks all gave people infinite excitement, coupled with various favorable factors, which promoted the activity of Chinese stocks. At the current stage, the number of Chinese stock chips is limited. Once buyers purchase them, it will form a situation where supply cannot meet demand. Therefore, the forward advance of prices is almost expected.</p>
<p>In summary, the market prices of Chinese stocks in the past week, such as Wing On and Sincere in the department store industry, were flat first and then firm. Since China Knitwear broke through the 20-yuan mark, its bottom has been stable. Moreover, due to the rising price of yarn, it once rose to over 25 yuan, although it immediately fell back, it remained stable at around 24.5 yuan. The volume of financial industry stocks was quiet at first and then increased. The price of the Bank of China fluctuated between 144 and 145 yuan. The Bank of Communications fluctuated between 137.5 and 140 yuan. The Continental Bank was quite active in the previous week, but has been less active since last week. There was not much trading in Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Industrial, Bank of Shanghai, etc. As for the new pharmaceutical stocks, since the dividends and bonuses for the last year have not been issued by each company, rumors of each company issuing dividends this week have become very loud, and the powerful ones have taken the opportunity to purchase them, and the number of circulating chips has suddenly become scarce. It was initially expected that the 35-yuan mark for the new shares of Sun Asia would be difficult to break through, but it was finally realized on Friday, and it once soared to 36.25 yuan. The new shares of China France rose from around 54 yuan to 58 yuan, and there is still the possibility of further increases. The prices of all other stocks also rose from flat to outstanding. As for the industrial stocks, the large investors continued to absorb the new shares of World, and the price rose from 59 yuan to near 70 yuan. The trend of Great China Match was fluctuating. The market prices of textile stocks, such as Wing On Textile, Dat Fong Dyeing &amp; Weaving, and Qing Textile, have all advanced without retreating, probably due to the rise in yarn prices.</p>
<p>In short, the stability and reliability of investing in Chinese stocks has been unanimously recognized by people in society. However, to make the development of industrial and commercial enterprises, it is necessary to circulate their fixed capital chips. Once industrial and commercial enterprises are supported by funds, they will be like fish in water and trees facing the sun. The prospects for development are limitless. The vigorous phenomenon of Chinese stocks last week is really gratifying to us.</p>
<h3>Debt Market Contention</h3>
<p>— Sang</p>
<p>Once at the Upper Limit; Stalemate Has Not Ended</p>
<p>The public debt market situation last week, in terms of the overall trend, has reversed the past sluggish situation and turned into a firm and stable state. However, both buyers and sellers have strong forces; therefore, the process of the six days was suddenly rising and falling, changing in many ways, with extreme struggles; as a result, the long side temporarily won, and the closing prices of various stocks on Saturday all rose compared to the closing prices of the previous Saturday. It is estimated that Grade A rose by 4.1 yuan, Grade B rose by 3.8 yuan, Grade C rose by 3.4 yuan, Grade D rose by 4.1 yuan, and Grade E rose by 4 yuan. The past situation is briefly reviewed below:</p>
<p>At the beginning of the week, the scattered short positions on all sides were buying in at low prices, and the new short positions that had been constantly dumped in the previous weeks had stopped selling for the time being; therefore, the situation on the surface turned stable, and various stocks began to rise back by half a yuan to one yuan. However, the next day, another batch of new goods from the same side came out, and the momentum of buying was frustrated; fortunately, the number sold was limited, so the result was that both rises and falls were seen, but the goals of both buyers and sellers were quite different; the former tended to Grade C, while the latter focused on Grades B and E, resulting in the miracle that Grade B was 0.3 yuan lower than Grade C; and Grade E was 5 yuan lower than Grade C. On Wednesday, favorable news was disclosed in various newspapers, and the main banking groups and the North Gang in the financial community also began to absorb it vigorously, and the market situation suddenly became prosperous: Grade A jumped by 4 yuan, which led to the upper limit; there was continued development on Thursday, but the new goods of large investors were waiting for high prices to seek a way out, so the higher the price, the more selling surged; the long side was afraid of not knowing how many real goods were flowing out from the short side, and had to restrain its momentum slightly; therefore, the atmosphere was not as enthusiastic as in the past, but turned into an uncertain situation. By the weekend, the floating long positions had not been able to hold out for long, and began to come out; at this time, the large investors on both the buying and selling sides were collecting their troops and watching quietly, so they let the floating long positions squeeze each other, and the trend was all the way down, and the decline of Grades A and C was particularly strong. The highest prices of various stocks throughout the week were seen on Friday, and the lowest prices, except for Grades D and E, which were seen on Tuesday, were found in Grade A on Monday.</p>
<p>Looking forward to the future trend, in general observation, both the long and short sides seem to be waiting in battle, preparing to launch a decisive battle: but the sellers are unwilling to sell cheaply because the prices are too low, and the long side is unwilling to buy in at high prices; therefore, it is expected that although the competition between the two sides is fierce, there is no situation of one side dominating. Or, if it is encouraged by the news, it depends on which side it is beneficial to, and can rely on to boost its momentum, then it can determine who will win or lose.</p>
<h3>The Sudden Rise and Fall of Yarn and Cloth</h3>
<p>— Quan</p>
<p>The yarn and cloth situation last week still fluctuated greatly. At the beginning, under the influence of favorable buying winds, the industry actively purchased, so coarse and fine yarn and cloth continued to advance towards new highs. At the highest point, 20-count Shuangma Factory single yarn saw 5,480 yuan, spot goods saw 6,200 yuan, 20-count Double Globe yarn saw 6,250 yuan, 12-pound Dapeng fine cloth saw 235 yuan, and 16-pound Globe coarse cloth saw 265 yuan, all breaking past records. On Thursday, those who profited took advantage of the high prices to sell, so the market once fell back. Shuangma Factory single yarn once fell to a low of 4,320 yuan. The difference between the rise and fall in a week reached a huge amount of more than 1,000 yuan, and the decline of coarse and fine cloth was also about 20 to 30 yuan, and the amplitude was also quite large. Later, because the factory's production was not abundant and the spot chips continued to be tight, large investors dragged in at low prices, and the price rebounded again. However, the rumors of waiting for the future were frequent, and people's hearts were not as stable as at the beginning of the week, which caused the market atmosphere to be erratic, and it presented a situation of a sudden rise and fall. The yarn and cloth situation, which had been rising all the way, entered a tortuous and winding realm again.</p>
<p>However, compared with the market price of the previous week, the result was still a huge increase. 10-count yarn rose by about 300 to 400 yuan, 20-count yarn rose by about 500 yuan to more than 1,000 yuan, of which the rise of Double Globe yarn was the most fierce, with a sharp increase of more than 1,050 yuan compared to the previous week, and each grade of yarn above 32-count also jumped up by about 1,000 yuan. Because of this, cotton cloth, which is dependent on each other, also rose by about 20 to 30 yuan at the same time.</p>
<p>In summary, the most rapid rise and fall of various yarn and cloth conditions last week should be Shuangma Factory single yarn. After the authorities controlled the transfer of materials, the issue of the movement of cotton goods has become the focus of speculation in the minds of the market. Therefore, at present, there is a huge phenomenon of a difference of 600 to 700 yuan between Shuangma Factory single yarn and spot goods. However, at the end of last week, it was affected by the fact that factory singles could be driven out, which caused a significant reaction, so the difference between the two was slightly squeezed. Secondly, the continued existence of long-term swap fees in the speculative market. At the highest point, the long side had a high price of 50 yuan, which had never been seen before. This situation reflects the increasing number of floating longs in the market. If we analyze it according to the principle of reaction, after the yarn price has risen in a straight line for several days, the footing line has gradually become weak. If there is a slight unexpected stimulus, the possibility of reaction will increase day by day. However, from the perspective of long-term development, the basic footing of yarn and cloth is still very good.</p>

<h3>Terrifying Wall Writings</h3>
<p>— Xu Ge</p>
<p>One day, in the houses of the New Hope Hygiene Experiment Zone, a few framed posters were found hanging on the wall. Of course, these framed posters were dull, silent, and speechless, but from the various charts and statistical texts, one couldn't help but be shocked.</p>
<p>"Life and death are predestined, wealth and honor are determined by Heaven." True, that's right. But when the statistics of birth and death are shown to you, you will feel that things are not that simple. From the two tables of birth statistics and death statistics, our China always accounts for the largest number. There are many births and rapid deaths, which almost becomes a "hedge." The highest birth and death rates are in China, followed by India.</p>
<p>Longevity is the first of the five blessings, so let's look at the "Comparison of Average Lifespan of Various Countries" table. China again occupies the top spot, with an average lifespan of 30 years for Chinese men and women. The next are Japan, France, the United States, and Denmark. Denmark is Danish, with an average life expectancy of 61.9 years for women and 60.3 years for men. Almost two Chinese people's lifespans are needed to equal one Dane's.</p>
<p>Having a disease and not knowing how to find a normal doctor, and not knowing hygiene in peacetime, like those who die unjustly, according to the statistics listed in "Annual Super-Capacity Deaths," there are 6 million Chinese people who become "unjustly dead ghosts" every year. The economic consumption per person per year is estimated at a minimum of 50 yuan. (Of course, this refers to the prices before. If we talk about the current situation, we can only buy a斗 of rice.) Then this economic loss in one year will be 30 billion yuan. To narrow the scope, the number of people who die unjustly each year accounts for 15 out of every 1,000 people, and their average age is 10 years old.</p>
<p>In other areas, such as maternal mortality and infectious disease mortality, China is again a "Number One" high school.</p>
<p>The percentage of deaths from infectious diseases in various countries is highest in China, at 42.3%; Australia is the lowest, at 9%. The weather is gradually getting hotter, and infectious diseases are about to rise again. Can we not be chilled when we see these statistical figures?</p>
<p>Why should a person pay attention to hygiene? Why is public health the primary plan for municipal implementation? These simple "wall writings" seem to be able to answer everything.</p>

<h3>The Market of Iran</h3>
<p>— Yang Huashi</p>
<p>Every spring, between April and May, the nomadic Iranians hold a grand market in the Isfahan area.</p>
<p>From the time of the Persian King Abbas the Great in the 16th century to the present day, the lively atmosphere has not changed much. This market centers on Meidan, a square about 500 meters long, which was once the place where monarchs reviewed troops or received foreign envoys. Nearby is a mosque with a blue roof, and the spacious corridors inside the mosque also serve as temporary market spaces. The pavilions, which are usually closed year-round, are all open at this time.</p>
<p>The weather is clear, and everyone feels happy. Many people are conducting their most important transactions of the year, and the whole place is filled with medieval oriental charm.</p>
<p>The Iranian monarch and nobles come to visit, further increasing public interest. The wealthiest carpet and fabric merchants pile up their goods in the courtyard of a former prince's private residence. Their shops are always set in front of an ancient bronze gate.</p>
<p>There are the most grocery stalls, selling various seeds, cosmetics, spices, fennel, cinnamon, peanuts, date paste, raisins, melon seeds, as well as mirrors, honey, rouge, etc. There are also vendors selling medicinal materials, which are the most needed items for the locals.</p>
<p>Many food shops have doorways decorated with garlands and ovens placed in front, baking various pastries. Passersby all buy some to taste.</p>
<p>In this market, there are at least fifty jewelers. Low glass cabinets display gold earrings and bracelets, amber necklaces, low-quality sapphires, antique-style rings, and pleasing fine gold and silver threads. Iranian women, who love decoration, have to come to the market once a year to buy these things.</p>
<p>Although the pot sellers have a large stock of goods, they are still hammering iron non-stop, and the sound is deafening. Dyers also solicit business here, their hands dyed blue, purple, ochre... Dye vats are placed all around, and foreign tourists cannot help but feel surprised.</p>
<p>In the tunnels of the temple, there are many children selling pottery jars, basins, plates, and the like. The carpet merchants have the most variety of patterns, singing strange tunes to attract customers. Some wear entirely white clothing (white hats, white trousers, long robes) and weave carpets on a small loom. Iranian carpets are world-renowned, and the ones sold here are very cheap.</p>
<p>Arabs hang eye-catching colored signs in the aisles, selling livestock and birds, and their goods are placed in large tents in the open space.</p>
<p>There are also many shoe repairers here, who often oil the shoes of soldiers and police officers for free. They specialize in mending broken shoes, and after repair, those with frayed threads and broken soles look as good as new. There are many customers, so these shoe repairers also have ranks. Those with good skills are patronized by high-ranking people, and their hospitality is particularly attentive. Some hang a birdcage on one side of their stall and place a few fresh flowers on the other, making it easy to identify.</p>
<p>In a corner, there is a very small mosque, which is for merchants participating in the market to pray in. The stone-paved courtyard has a small pool of holy water, which attracts tourists.</p>
<p>People from nearby come to the Isfahan market to purchase goods, and residents from afar come once every few years, so there are yellow-bearded Jews, long-robed Muslims, and soldiers in sky-blue uniforms everywhere. Many locals wear clothes that have not changed in style for over a hundred years, riding donkeys to the market. Some paint their white horses in various colors, and at first glance, people think they are strange wild animals that have never been seen in a zoo.</p>
<p>Many policemen in British-style uniforms also patrol the market to maintain order or protect the officials who come here. The poor people nearby, men, women, old, and disabled, all come to the market to beg, often surrounding shops in groups. After the police drive them away, they gather at the door of another shop before long.</p>
<p>After the spring passes, people leave this place.</p>
<h3>The Power of Self-Confidence</h3>
<p>— Translated by Ye Meizhen</p>
<p>If anyone can truly realize the potential within humanity, that person will be able to accomplish great things. But people often deny and despise themselves. They only complain, saying: "I am just a person." Or "I am a woman. What can I do?"</p>
<p>Was Florence Nightingale not a woman? Yet she founded the Red Cross. If this British nurse had only grieved over being a woman, what could the work of healing have accomplished? How miserable would the world be today?</p>
<p>If Madame Curie had only looked down on herself after her husband's death and sighed idly, "I am just a woman!" Then how could the magical work of radium exist today?</p>
<p>That's right! No matter what you are, just stubbornly say: "I can believe. That's enough!" As Nightingale and Madame Curie once said. So they faced their work with full ambition and faith.</p>
<p>When a six-year-old son brought home an expulsion notice from school, was this mother helpless? "My son is not stupid. I will train him myself," she said. So she really did it. Thomas Edison succeeded as a result!</p>

<h3>A Miniature Underwater Tour</h3>
<p>— Jian Nong</p>
<p>——A Glimpse of the Aurora Museum</p>
<p>Every time I read scientists' descriptions of underwater explorations, I yearn for it so much that I can't wait to follow them, riding in a diving bell, to witness the ecology of all kinds of strange and colorful flora and fauna in that mysterious sea kingdom! Unexpectedly, this dream seems to have come true for me in a corner of the Aurora Museum. …</p>
<p>There,—in the deepest part of the second floor—there is an almost square table, with glass covers all over it: if you regard that clear glass as clear seawater and inject your gaze into it, you will be able to realize how realistic a miniature ocean that is. … The lowest layer is paved with gravel and fine sand that closely resembles the seabed, with rocky outcroppings and branching coral. These corals come in various colors of red, white, and gray: some have lush branches, like an ancient cypress, and some have gnarled roots, like an old pine; but the most beautiful and moving are those things with thousands of layers and petals, pleated and graceful, resembling two white peony flowers, whose names I do not know.</p>
<p>Speaking of other animals: look at the huge lobster, wearing helmet and armor, lying prone on the beach; look at the small, sword-wielding shrimp, hidden in the reefs. There are also several kinds of crabs with shields: some have particularly long claws, to show their greedy heart of grabbing everything they see, near and far; and there are even various kinds of shells carrying fortresses: some are sharp like pens, some are angular like tiles, and some have tall, bone-like protrusions, to show their forbidding attitude that does not allow offense to the touch. …</p>
<p>However, the most noteworthy and what I have admired and savored for a long time is the supple, upright "Venus's flower basket!" belonging to the sponge family, which is snow-white all over. It is also called the Bridal Basket. --A flower basket? Really, look at how exquisitely and beautifully Venus—Nature—has woven it? Its shape resembles a cylinder, slightly thicker at the top and thinner at the root attached to the rock; about seven or eight inches high, and the diameter at the thickest place is only a little over an inch; the whole body is woven entirely of snow-white and supple fine threads: first, groups of evenly arranged warp threads rise from the root to the top, and then circles of weft threads cross over to divide them into square meshes; there are also fluffy down filling the four corners of these meshes, so that they become hexagonal or circular; in addition, there are strands of fine threads woven in a spiral, and at the top, they form ornaments that resemble lace and tassels. … Heavens! Can the most intelligent painters create such delicate patterns, and can the most exquisite needle-wielding embroiderers weave such petite and exquisite works? …</p>
<p>I stood next to this "Venus's flower basket," admiring and savoring it in a daze: I was amazed and praised the marvel of nature! …</p>

<h3>Machine-Gun Style Loudspeaker</h3>
<p>— Yongyun</p>
<p>The latest type of sound amplifier looks like a machine gun. It is said that this style is the most effective, and the audience can hear the broadcast exceptionally clearly, and all mixed sounds can be avoided. However, some people say that this style has a bad psychological effect on the audience, especially in wartime.</p>
<h3>Notes on Malta</h3>
<p>— Dafen</p>
<p>Recently, it was reported that the Axis powers are constantly bombing Malta. However, this small island has been painstakingly managed by the British for 143 years, and she seems determined not to easily let it fall into enemy hands. A British political commentator said: "As long as Malta is ours, victory is certain."</p>
<p>But what is so important about this small island, only seventeen miles long and nine miles wide! In fact, its importance lies entirely in its geographical location. It is located in the narrowest part of the Mediterranean Sea between Italy and Africa, and is called the key to the Mediterranean by military strategists. It forms a three-legged position with Gibraltar at the mouth of the Mediterranean and Aden at the southern end of the Red Sea, guaranteeing the safety of the British Empire's shipping route through the Suez Canal to India.</p>
<p>Malta is not only a naval and air force base, but also an important coaling station. Its harbor is excellent and unmatched in the world. The British Mediterranean Fleet headquarters is located here, and all kinds of warships and submarines can be seen in the harbor. The island has an arsenal and a particularly abundant coal reserve.</p>
<p>The population of Malta is about 240,000, with an average of more than 200 people per square mile, so it cannot be self-sufficient. There are about 10,000 farmers on the island, and the output is poor, with only a small amount of wheat, vegetables, and apples. The total value of annual exports is estimated at £250,000, while imports reach £4 million, resulting in a huge trade deficit. In fact, the survival of Malta depends on the British Royal Navy, which spends as much as £1 million annually on repairs and other things, all of which is earned by Malta's dockworkers, mechanical workers, etc. Today, all that is seen on the streets of Malta are sailors, soldiers, air force personnel, engineering service personnel, and passing merchants, which has completely changed the face of the past, when people from all walks of life gathered there.</p>
<h3>In the Same Boat Through Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(4) In the Twilight</p>
<p>Guofang intended to invite Weicheng to go, but Weicheng could not go, but instead kept Guofang there. In just a few days of separation, they already had so much to say, Weicheng was like this, and Guofang was like this too. At first, they talked about big and distant things, such as Mrs. Ye's funeral, etc.; later, they touched on small and nearby things, and Weicheng also asked about the price per foot of the fabric Guofang was wearing. They sat casually in the Shuangmei Study, with Magpie walking around to serve them; Cuizhen knew that Guofang was not leaving, so she decided to prepare a place for Guofang to stay in the inner room of the Shuangmei Study. Weicheng laughed: "Sister Cuizhen, don't be busy, come and talk to Guofang. Although Guofang is studying at a school in Shanghai, and although Shanghai is a prosperous and beautiful place; and girls' schools are seen as aristocratic places; Guofang has not been contaminated with any bad habits. Come and talk to her." Cuizhen held a feather duster in her hand, stood still and laughed: "I don't know what to say, you talk, and it's all about books, I don't understand at all. If I don't speak, Miss Chen will still laugh in her stomach, but if I speak, Miss Chen will laugh on her face." Guofang was originally sitting on a chair, but when she heard Cuizhen say this, she almost jumped up, went over and tugged at Cuizhen's arm, pressed her into the chair and said: "I also call you Sister Cuizhen. You are an unsung hero of the Ye family, and there isn't one in my family. My family only has a grandmother..." Weicheng said: "You are comparing Sister Cuizhen to your grandmother, which Sister Cuizhen dares not accept. I said let's talk casually, we live in the countryside, and it's not as good as Guofang living in Shuangqiao Town. Buying things, eating and using them, is more convenient, to tell you the truth, being here means that the hospitality is inadequate." Guofang laughed: "You don't allow me to be polite, but you are being polite." (60)</p>
