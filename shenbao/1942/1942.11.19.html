<p>漢口十八日中央社電　在主席此次巡視武漢、民心感奮、十七日晚又向武漢曁湘鄂贛豫官民廣播、情同懇摯、聽者動容、文云、武漢各位同胞、兄弟今日父得與武漢同胞相見、眞是萬感交集、有幾句話想對武漢同胞說、並且對環繞武漢的鄂湘贛豫各省同胞說、武漢地方我經過好幾回了、第一回是在辛亥十月杪、爲南北和議前來奔走、及至和議告成、淸帝退位、民國統一、又於元年三月初隨着國父孫先生來過一回、第三回是左十六年四月初、我從歐洲同來、那時候正是國民革命軍北伐勝利於克復武漢之後進而克服南京可是國民黨與共產黨的衝突、亦到了無可調和的階段了、那時候南京舉行淸黨、我在武漢苦苦支持了幾個月、曾經陷在四面夾攻的地位、卒於五六月間北打退了張學良、西打退了楊森、七月間舉行淸黨、把共產黨驅逐出國民黨以外、九月間下兵東南、在南京完成國民黨的統一、這幾個月的艱難辛苦、是我親身與武漢同胞共嘗的、第四回是在廿六年十一月杪那時候由七七事變演成八一三事變、以致上海失守、南京危急、國民政府遷至武漢、在十二月初、因德國的斡旋、以爲中日事變可以收拾了、無如再把這機會錯過、南京遂告失陷、徐州等處、亦相繼淪陷、直至廿七年八月中、方才離開武漢、前赴重慶、這幾個月不但艱難辛苦、而且危急存亡、這種况味也是我親身與武漢同胞共嘗的、自此以後我懷着與蔣介石不斷絕關係離開重慶的念頭、及至接連看着武漢失陷、長沙焚燒、廣州丢棄、種種慘劇、我終於下了決心、由重慶赴河內、公開發表我的和平主張、開始我的和平運動了、廿九年三月秒、國民政府還都南京、我於四月間第五回來到武漢、屈指算來、我和武漢同胞已經有兩年多不見了、想到中國還在危急存亡中、別的不用說、連全面和平還朱做到、怎的不萬感交集呢、大約武漢同胞也是和我一樣感慨的、然而我有一句話向武漢各位同胞說、並且向環繞武漢的鄂湘贛豫的各位同胞說、和平興反共、都已經着着進步、成功之日不遠了、中國得救的日子已經到來了。我爲什麽敢說這樣樂觀的話呢、各位同胞知道過幾日便是十一月二十五日、這是去年國民政府加人世界反共協定的日子、再過幾日便是十一月三十日、這是前年國民政府締結中日基本關係條約、發表中日滿共同宣言的日子、又過幾日便是十二月八日、這是去年友邦日本發動大東亞戰爭的日子、同時又是國民政府發表聲明與友邦日本同甘共苦的日子、這三個日子、是決定了中國應該直的方向、同時又是使中國走上了一條光明大道、以前的艱難困苦、存亡危急、將由此一轉爲更生爲復興了、先就反共來說、我們初時只是國內反共、可是由於中日滿共同宜言便進一步而爲結成東亞軸心、以共同反共了、由於加入日德義等國防共協定、便更進一步而爲結成世界軸心以共同反共了、現在共產黨在國際的勢力已一落千丈、在國內更是走向潰滅的路上去、而我們的反共陣綫、如此强固、如此擴大、多年未了的反共事業、必然就此完成、再就和平來說、我們初時所謂和平、只是中日兩國本於大亞洲主義之理想、以從事善隣友好、可是自從大東亞戰爭發動以後、善隣友好已進而爲同甘共苦了、大亞洲主義之理想、已進而實現了、中國只要能與友邦日本同心同德、協力完遂大東亞戰爭、中國必能取得伙伴之資格、而且必能取得强有力伙伴之資格、那麽東亞保得了、中國也就得救、多年未了的和平心願必然也就此完成、可見我剛才所說和平反共的成功、已經不遠、中國得救的日子已經到來、決不是隨口安慰的話、而是實實在在說得到做得到的話、各位同胞放心罷、大光明已在眼前、只要我們大家本着新國民運動所指示、認定了復興中華保衛東亞的使命、提起了勇猛精進刻苦耐勞的精神、一直的幹下去、卅多年來的艱難辛苦危急存亡、必然得到報酬的、十幾日前、我在北京曾對大衆說過、我們要與友邦日本同甘共苦、先要自己與大衆同甘共苦我們知道、在全面和平尙未實現、大東亞戰爭尙未完遂以前、我們目己和友邦都是很苦的、我們要以現在之共苦、求將來之同甘、我們現在能團結、能親愛能忍受目前之痛苦、則我們之共同目的、必然達到那時候自然苦盡甘來了、各位同胞、三十多年來的經騐吿訴我們、我們所走的路是不錯的、是使中國走上光明大道的、各位同胞、努力罷、前進罷、</p>

<h3>落葉植物的渡冬</h3>
<p>— 江應時</p>
<p>雖然是「秋盡江南草未凋」，但如果有人說冬天不會來了，或者說今年的冬天會暖和得和春天一樣，那不是獃子便是故作驚人之談的騙子。</p>
<p>一到了冬天，上海公園和路旁最多的法國梧桐的葉子，便開始大量地脫落：直到仲冬，它們脫落得亁亁凈凈。到那時，在公園或路上走的敏感的人，就不免有些傷歎。</p>
<p>但傷歎只是從人們對落葉植物的直覺招引來的。其實，落葉植物並沒有放棄生存的奮鬥。在冬天，因爲能吸收的水分稀少，而且空氣亁燥，蒸發甚厲，如果要維持繁多葉子的存在，必至植物體內缺少水分，致幹枝葉俱枯。所以，它們寗讓葉子脫落，而儲蓄着生命之力，兀立在朔風冰雪之中，等候春的來臨。當春天來臨的時候，它們便吐芽長葉，和其他的生物構成一幅美麗的春景。</p>
<p>如果落葉植物不落葉或雖落葉而不積儲精力，結果會怎樣呢？當然是死於嚴冬，或不能在春天活躍。但植物很少有這種情形，在人類中却是常見的。</p>
<p>家庭</p>
<h3>讀書與吃書</h3>
<p>— 崇華</p>
<p>—日記二則—</p>
<p>去年十二月八日以後，滬渝交通斷絕，父親有好幾個月沒有寄錢回來了。我們家中的生活，僅依賴些微的積蓄，勉强維持了幾個月。六月二十一日，幣制變更後，我們的生活更感覺到困難了。</p>
<p>暑假快過完，學校又要開學了，我和三個哥哥的學費，簡直毫無辦法。</p>
<p>有一天傍晚，母親和我到一位父親的摯友劉伯父家裏去，商量關於我們學費的問題。商量之後，決計把家中所藏的一部「四部叢刊」賣去，作爲我們的學費。母親也答應了。</p>
<p>父親最愛買書，他所賺的錢，差不多都買了書了。這些書代表父親半生的心血，也是我們家中惟一的財產。我做夢也沒有想到：現在會爲了我們的讀書而把它賣掉。</p>
<p>今天，劉伯父來搬書了。我和三哥把已經包好的書，ｇ　包一包的搬上洋車。含着淚看着那壯健的車夫，把父親半生的心血，我們家寳貴的財產拉走了。回頭看着母親愁容滿面的臉，我的淚禁不住偷偷地流了下來。這些書所得的代價呢？付去了我們四人的學費，所餘的不足一月的家用。這學期勉强混過去了。下學期的學費怎麽辦呢？下個月的生活費，又怎麽辦呢？啊！我不敢往下想了·（七月三十日晚記）</p>
<p>秋天過完了，冬天又來了，孩子的我，又糊裏糊塗的過了幾個月。這幾個月裏生活費用還是不斷地高漲，米賣到七百元一擔，煤球賣二十六元一擔，而父親還是沒有一文錢寄回來。家裏的生活，雖承一位朋友按月借一點錢。但是這區區之數，那兒會够呢？</p>
<p>前星期，母親和我又到劉伯父家裏去商量關於吃飯的問題，結果，只有和以前一樣的賣書了。家裏的藏書，雖然不少，但是能够賣錢的，只有一部中華書局出版的二十四史。只要價錢賣得比現在書局裏的定價便宜，就不愁沒有人要。</p>
<p>前三天，劉伯父來了說：「書已經有人要了，你們快請出來，過兩天送到我家來。」昨天晚上，我和哥哥們一塊兒整理着這部書，大家心裏充滿着憂傷。眼看這部二十四史能够留在家裏的時間，是不滿二十四小時了。</p>
<p>今天早晨，我到學校去上課。回來吃午飯時，眼前已經沒有這部書了。我默默的吃完了飯，懷着一顆創傷的心，走到樓上。我想：這部二十四史頂多吃到今年年底。要是明年，父親還是沒有錢寄回來，我們的讀書和生活怎麼辦呢？（十一月十四日記）</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>

<p>雙梅書屋裏，另外換了一種空氣。是和悅的，是興奮的，是新奇的。黄龍有些像自做官自喝道，他自己做莊，却自己吆喝着「一五九」「四八」「七簇」「上莊，」一共輪到拿兩張牌，却還捨不得一箍腦兒拿出來看。先在指頭上吹一口氣，然後把指頭去抓牌，又先把一張牌疊在一張牌上，然後很有勁的移得左手的掌心裏；又先喝了一聲，然後把指頭和掌心凑到他臉上，把眼光尖尖的放進去，看了一張牌，那又一張牌却讓指頭去看了。這種看牌力法，在阿興何子興倒還常常有得看見，那翠珍和喜鵲，却還初次見到，便驚奇得笑了，一笑，倒又滿不在乎輸錢和贏錢覺得便輸幾个錢，這種快樂是葉府上好些時候沒有了。</p>

<h3>一個賣淫女的自訴</h3>
<p>— 玉珍</p>
<p>敬仰的編輯先生：</p>
<p>我不知怎樣稱呼你才好，因爲我們太渴望你的繁忙了。編輯先生：素仰你公正熱心社會，肯寫一般苦難的人吶喊，所以我才寫了這一篇不成熟的東西，算是一點低微的苦痛的叫喊吧！望先生削改後，借貴報的一角之地刋載出來，藉此來矯正一般人對我們錯誤的觀念，不勝感激！此請編安！　愚玉珍上</p>
<p>（一）為了生活强顏歡笑</p>
<p>我是一個久被社會遺棄的，和爲人所不齒的而永遠被鄙視的一個站在馬路上拉客的所謂妽妓女子。我寫這篇文章的動機，不是想借此求到什麽物質上的援助，不過是想來對一般人解釋他們對我們錯誤的認識而已。</p>
<p>我們時常爲一般人所痛駡，所不齒。並且將一切惡毒的名詞，加到我們的身上。什麽「爛汚婊子水性楊花」，「無情的妓女下流胚子」，還有很多很多的。唉！我不說了。反正這樣的名詞也不是光榮的。我們眞不明白，這一般人爲什麽偏偏的對我們過不去呢？</p>
<p>他們說我們「生張熟李，朝秦暮楚」。是的，這是事實。但是我要請問一句，一個客人住了一宿，給了我們一些有限的代價，第二天就不來了。難道說，我們就能靠着這幾個有限的錢去過生活，而餓着肚皮去為他們守貞操嗎？我們不朝秦暮楚又能怎麼辦？他們都抱着解決性慾的心理來找我們，花幾個有限的臭錢，就得到了他們的需要。第二天一走了之，從此成為陌路人。這樣叫我們又怎樣的能拿出真的愛情來對她們呢？不生張熟李又怎麼辦？有人爲了我們送張迎李，竟然說我們是生來的賣淫貨，眞是天曉得！我們生來就是賣淫的嗎？我們賣淫是出於我們自願的嗎？如果有碗飯吃的話，我相信誰也不肯將自己淸白的身體毫無自由地任人蹂躪，奴顏婢膝地去承人的歡笑；自己含着一泡眼淚，而偏要去强笑出來。我想，眞的，如果不爲生活的話，誰也不肯這樣的去做吧！（未完。移酬助學）</p>

<h3>Solomon Islands Third Naval Battle: Japanese Navy's Consolidated War Results; Many Allied Ships Sunk; Three American Officers Killed in Action</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th Dispatch from Domei News Agency: The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM today that, in the Third Solomon Islands Naval Battle from the 12th to the 14th of this month, the Japanese Navy attacked Guadalcanal Island, sinking eight cruisers and four or five destroyers of the enemy; damaging two battleships, three cruisers, and three or four destroyers. Furthermore, the Guadalcanal airfield and other facilities suffered heavy damage after being extensively attacked by the Japanese. A total of sixty-three enemy aircraft were shot down, and ten were damaged. The Japanese side lost one battleship, one cruiser, and two destroyers sunk; one battleship heavily damaged; and seven transport ships. Thirty-two Japanese aircraft crashed into enemy lines, with nine failing to return. According to the announcement, this battle occurred when Japanese forces protecting transport ships encountered a fierce attack by enemy aircraft, and then encountered the enemy fleet northwest of Guadalcanal Island. The result was the destruction of most of the enemy ships that fled south. The original text of the Imperial Headquarters announcement is as follows: "The Imperial Navy fleet has been continuously engaged in combat since November 12th. On the night of the 12th, a fierce attack was launched on the enemy's air base on Guadalcanal Island, inflicting heavy damage on the airfield and its facilities. On November 14th, the enemy launched a fierce counterattack. The Imperial fleet protected the transport fleet as it advanced and encountered an enemy reinforcement fleet at the northwest end of the island at night. This fleet included two battleships and more than four large cruisers. Fierce fighting ensued, and most of the enemy auxiliary ships were sunk, with two battleships heavily damaged. The enemy fleet then retreated southward. The consolidated war results from November 12th to 14th and the Japanese losses during the same period are as follows: Enemy ship losses: Eight cruisers sunk, including three new types; five sunk immediately after being hit; four or five destroyers; one transport ship. Two battleships, two cruisers, and two or four destroyers, and three transport ships were damaged. Enemy aircraft losses: Sixty-three aircraft shot down, and more than ten destroyed. Japanese losses: One battleship sunk, one cruiser sunk, three destroyers sunk, one battleship heavily damaged, seven transport ships heavily damaged, and thirty-two aircraft crashed into enemy lines, with nine failing to return. The naval battles from November 12th to 14th are referred to as the Third Solomon Islands Naval Battle."</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th Dispatch from Central News Agency: Since early August, the US Navy has continued to resist stubbornly on Guadalcanal Island. However, since the South Pacific Naval Battle unfolded north of Santa Cruz Island on October 26th, the US forces in that area have fallen into isolation. In order to restore communication with the island, the US Navy has continuously dispatched new and elite troops as reinforcements since the 10th of this month. Upon learning of this, the Japanese Navy forces charged into the enemy's air circle on the 12th. Although the Japanese forces were in an unfavorable environment, they still fiercely attacked the enemy air force base on Guadalcanal Island on the night of the 13th, severely damaging the enemy airfield and other military facilities. On the night of the 14th, they encountered a large number of enemy reinforcement forces, which consisted of two battleships and four large cruisers. In addition to two battleships being heavily damaged by Japanese Navy torpedoes, the remaining cruisers and supply ships were almost entirely destroyed or sunk by the Japanese Navy. Seeing the unfavorable situation, the enemy forces fled southward. In this battle, three main US commanders—Rear Admiral Callaghan, Rear Admiral Scott, and Captain Cassin Young, the captain of a cruiser—were killed in action. The Japanese Navy lost one battleship. In the three months from the First Solomon Islands Naval Battle to the Third Solomon Islands Naval Battle, the US Navy attempted to open what it called the Second Pacific Front, believing that the Japanese forces in the Solomon Islands were the weakest, and launched a counterattack. However, after the aforementioned battles, their efforts have been almost entirely lost, and the so-called counterattack and opening of the Second Pacific Front have ultimately become a pipe dream. As a result, the Japanese forces can now confidently secure victory in the land battles on Guadalcanal Island. The three US lines of attack against Japan—from the Aleutian Islands in the north, Wake Island in the east, and the Solomon Islands in the south—have been successively blockaded by the Japanese forces. At this point, the US forces can no longer attempt a large-scale counterattack and can only allow the Japanese Navy to expand its control of the seas.</p>

<h3>Chairman Wang Returns to Nanjing After Inspecting Wuhan; Broadcasts to Officials and Civilians of Four Provinces Before Departure</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 18th Dispatch from Central News Agency: The National Government Chairman, to inspect the Wuhan area and hear about the political situation, accompanied by Secretary-General Chen Chunpu, Propaganda Minister Lin Baisheng, Vice Foreign Minister Zhou Longxiang, Director Huang Ziqiang, Chief of Staff Zhu Qingchuan, Secretary Chen Guozhi, Central Hospital Director Luo Guanglin, as well as Supreme Military Advisor Matsui and Lieutenant Colonel Okamoto, departed Nanjing at 9:00 AM on the 14th aboard a special plane for Wuhan. After arriving in Wuhan, they visited provincial administration and party affairs, reviewed the military, students, and Boy Scouts, and personally delivered speeches to various groups. Having completed their duties, they returned to Nanjing by plane at 10:45 AM on the 18th, accompanied by their entourage. Heads of various Yuan, ministries, commissions, and agencies were present to welcome them. After alighting from the plane amidst the sounds of military music, Chairman Wang frequently nodded in response to the welcomers. Secretary-General Chen Chunpu, Propaganda Minister Lin Baisheng, and others also disembarked from the plane and returned to their residences to rest.</p>
<p>Hankou, 18th Dispatch from Central News Agency: Chairman Wang's inspection of Wuhan and his return to Nanjing this morning are noteworthy. Wuhan is not only the center of the country but also the site of the Wuchang Uprising and currently the front line of the peace zone. Therefore, the Chairman attaches particular importance to issues such as safeguarding security and improving people's livelihoods. In addition to military and political issues, he expressed great concern for the relationship between flood relief, food, land reclamation, urban and rural areas, school education, and the situation of students. On the 15th, 16th, and 17th, he separately summoned military, political, and party personnel to listen to reports and give instructions. He also reviewed the military police, security forces, and students four times and delivered nine speeches to military, political, party personnel, youth corps, and Boy Scouts.</p>
<p>Hankou, 18th Dispatch from Central News Agency: Chairman Wang's inspection of Wuhan inspired the people. On the evening of the 17th, he also broadcasted to officials and civilians in Wuhan and the surrounding provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Henan, with sincere and earnest words that moved the listeners. The text stated: "Fellow countrymen of Wuhan, I am truly filled with a myriad of emotions to be able to meet with you, the people of Wuhan, today. I have a few words to say to the people of Wuhan, and also to the people of the surrounding provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Henan. I have passed through Wuhan several times. The first time was in late October of the Xinhai year, when I came to work for the peace talks between the North and the South. After the peace talks were concluded, the Qing Emperor abdicated, and the Republic of China was unified, I came again with the Father of the Nation, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, in early March of the first year of the Republic. The third time was in early April of the 16th year of the Republic, when I returned from Europe. At that time, the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army was victorious after recovering Wuhan and advancing to conquer Nanjing. However, the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party had also reached an irreconcilable stage. At that time, the Purge was carried out in Nanjing, and I struggled to hold on in Wuhan for several months, finding myself in a position surrounded on all sides. Finally, in May and June, I drove back Zhang Xueliang to the north and Yang Sen to the west. In July, I carried out the Purge and expelled the Communist Party from the Kuomintang. In September, I sent troops to the southeast and completed the unification of the Kuomintang in Nanjing. I personally shared these months of hardship and struggle with the people of Wuhan. The fourth time was in late November of the 26th year of the Republic. At that time, the July 7th Incident had evolved into the August 13th Incident, resulting in the loss of Shanghai and the crisis in Nanjing. The National Government moved to Wuhan. In early December, due to German mediation, it was believed that the Sino-Japanese Incident could be resolved. However, this opportunity was missed again, and Nanjing fell. Xuzhou and other places also fell one after another. It was not until mid-August of the 27th year that I left Wuhan for Chongqing. These months were not only difficult and arduous but also critical to survival. I personally shared this experience with the people of Wuhan. Since then, I left Chongqing with the intention of not severing relations with Chiang Kai-shek. When I witnessed the fall of Wuhan, the burning of Changsha, and the abandonment of Guangzhou, and other tragedies, I finally made up my mind to go to Hanoi from Chongqing, publicly announce my peace proposal, and begin my peace movement. In early March of the 29th year, the National Government returned to Nanjing. In April, I came to Wuhan for the fifth time. Counting on my fingers, it has been more than two years since I last saw the people of Wuhan. Considering that China is still in a critical state of survival and that overall peace has not yet been achieved, how could I not be filled with a myriad of emotions? I suppose the people of Wuhan feel the same way I do. However, I have a word to say to you, the people of Wuhan, and also to the people of the surrounding provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Henan: Peace and anti-communism are both making steady progress, and the day of success is not far off. The day of China's salvation has arrived. Why am I so optimistic? As you all know, in a few days, it will be November 25th, the anniversary of the National Government's accession to the World Anti-Communist Agreement last year. In a few more days, it will be November 30th, the anniversary of the National Government's conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty and the publication of the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration the year before last. And in a few more days, it will be December 8th, the anniversary of the friendly nation of Japan's launch of the Greater East Asia War last year, and also the day the National Government issued a statement sharing weal and woe with the friendly nation of Japan. These three days have determined the direction China should take, and they have also put China on a bright path. The previous hardships, difficulties, and critical state of survival will be transformed into renewal and revival. First, regarding anti-communism, we initially only opposed communism domestically. However, due to the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration, we advanced to forming the East Asian Axis to jointly oppose communism. Due to joining the Anti-Comintern Pact with Japan, Germany, and Italy, we advanced further to forming the World Axis to jointly oppose communism. Now, the international influence of the Communist Party has plummeted, and domestically it is heading towards the path of collapse. Our anti-communist front is so strong and so expanded that the anti-communist cause that has been unfinished for many years will inevitably be completed. Second, regarding peace, what we initially called peace was merely for China and Japan to engage in neighborly friendship based on the ideals of Pan-Asianism. However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, neighborly friendship has advanced to sharing weal and woe. The ideal of Pan-Asianism has advanced to realization. As long as China can work with the friendly nation of Japan with one heart and one mind and cooperate to complete the Greater East Asia War, China will be able to obtain the qualifications of a partner, and it will certainly be able to obtain the qualifications of a strong partner. Then, East Asia will be protected, and China will be saved. The long-cherished wish for peace will inevitably be fulfilled. It can be seen that the success of peace and anti-communism that I just mentioned is not far off, and the day of China's salvation has arrived. These are not just comforting words, but real words that can be said and done. Fellow countrymen, rest assured, great light is already in sight. As long as we all follow the directions indicated by the New Citizen Movement, recognize the mission of reviving China and protecting East Asia, and raise the spirit of courage, diligence, perseverance, and hard work, and keep working at it, the hardships, difficulties, and critical state of survival of the past thirty years will inevitably be rewarded. A dozen days ago, I told the public in Beijing that we must share weal and woe with the friendly nation of Japan, and first we must share weal and woe with the public. We know that until overall peace is realized and the Greater East Asia War is completed, we ourselves and the friendly nation will both be in great distress. We must use the current shared suffering to seek future shared happiness. If we can now unite, love each other, and endure the current suffering, then our common goal will inevitably be achieved. At that time, naturally, suffering will turn into happiness. Fellow countrymen, more than thirty years of experience tells us that the road we are taking is not wrong and that it is leading China to a bright future. Fellow countrymen, work hard, move forward!"</p>
<p>Hankou, 18th Dispatch from Central News Agency: Chairman Wang has been in Wuhan for four days since he came to inspect the political situation on the 14th. He has personally visited various parts of Wuhan in recent days, working extremely hard. Chairman Wang, accompanied by Propaganda Minister Lin, Vice Foreign Minister Zhou, received reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers and press agencies at the Xingya Club at 10:00 AM on the 17th. He first expressed his thoughts after arriving in Wuhan, answered various questions from the reporters, and expressed his deep gratitude for the cooperation of friendly people. The Chairman and the Chinese and foreign reporters took several photos together, and finally, refreshments were served. The meeting did not break up until about 12:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Severe Cold on the Eastern Front; Only Localized Battles</h3>
<p>Berlin, 18th Dispatch from Hai Tong News Agency: All sections of the Eastern Front were affected by rain, snow, and cold yesterday. In the Volkhov area, Soviet counterattacks were repelled. On the Don Front and in Stalingrad, there were only localized battles.</p>
<h3>Axis Forces in Tunisia Occupy the Important Port of Bizerte; 150,000 Allied Troops Advance Eastward; Large-Scale Air and Sea Battle Underway in the Strait of Sicily</h3>
<p>Berlin, 17th Dispatch from Domei News Agency: According to front-line reports, Axis troops have advanced into Bizerte, an important port in Tunisia.</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th Dispatch from Hai Tong News Agency: According to a military spokesman here yesterday, Axis forces and Anglo-American ground troops have not yet made contact in French North Africa.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 17th Dispatch from Domei News Agency: According to combined reports received here, the war situation in Tunisia is gradually maturing. Axis forces and Allied forces will soon engage in a major decisive battle. The vanguard of the Allied forces advancing into the Tunisian area from the Arzew area, combined with the British First Army under General Anderson and American armored units, totals 150,000 troops. One part advanced along the coast from Bone towards the port of Bizerte, while another part crossed the border from Tebessa, 200 kilometers south of Bone, and advanced towards Gabès in southern Tunisia, near the Libyan border, taking a north-south encirclement shape of Tunisia.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 17th Dispatch from Domei News Agency: According to reports received here, the fighting between Axis forces and Allied forces in Tunisia, centered on the Bizerte naval port area, has become increasingly fierce since the battle began, and as of the 16th, the battle lines have gradually expanded southward. Fierce offensive and defensive battles are constantly unfolding in Tunisia and its southern regions. At the same time, a continuous naval battle has been taking place in the Strait of Sicily since the morning of the 15th. Both sides have mobilized powerful air forces to fight a desperate battle in order to gain control of the air and sea in the Tunisian and Sicilian Strait areas.</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th Dispatch from Hai Tong News Agency: After Axis forces occupied the important French naval fortress of Bizerte in northern Tunisia, the advance of Anglo-American forces has been hindered, and Germany and Italy have gained an important springboard for operations in the Mediterranean. Bizerte is only 200 kilometers from Sicily, and both ends of the Strait of Sicily, the throat of the central Mediterranean, are now in Axis hands. Axis naval and air forces attacked enemy convoys, originally based in Sicily and the island of Pantelleria between Sicily and North Africa. Therefore, British ships were less at risk if they sailed close to the coast of North Africa. Now, British ships have no way to escape the two-pronged attack of the Axis naval and air forces. Bizerte Bay is located at the foot of the Atlas Mountains, seven kilometers southeast of Cap Blanc. The bay has an area of about 130 square kilometers and is a natural harbor. Ships can dock here to avoid maritime attacks. Behind the port of Bizerte is the square "Kasbah" fortress, part of which was built during the Roman Empire and is sufficient to prevent attacks from land. The nearby Spanish fortress is built on a small mountain, and its artillery can cover the entire city and harbor of Bizerte. Today, the city has a population of about 22,000, of which 18,000 are white. According to recent front-line dispatches, the Anglo-American forces advancing into Tunisia have not yet made contact with Axis forces. The contact on the Tunisian border reported by the US side is believed to refer to minor contact with French colonial troops. At the same time, Axis air forces stationed in Tunisia have stepped up their bombing of the advancing Anglo-American forces.</p>
<p>Rommel's Troops Shorten the Line, Continue to Withdraw Westward from Cyrenaica</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th Dispatch from Hai Tong News Agency: Regarding the situation in Cyrenaica, military sources said that German and Italian armored forces have maintained a considerable distance from enemy forces, so the Axis forces did not encounter enemy resistance when they reached the new position.</p>
<p>Berlin, 17th Dispatch from Havas News Agency: The military department announced: (1) The rearguard of Rommel's troops in North Africa did not make contact with British forces yesterday. (2) Last night, British armored units approached the southern route of the marching line and then retreated. (3) South of Gebel, Axis fighters repelled British aircraft. (4) The main force of the British Eighth Army, due to supply difficulties, is still entrenched in Tobruk and has not dared to advance further. The British side admits that the strength of Rommel's army remains intact. The retreating troops have destroyed the defensive fortifications, and the factories have also been withdrawn westward.</p>
<p>Spain Orders Mobilization to Maintain Sovereignty and Neutrality</p>
<p>Lisbon, 17th Dispatch from Domei News Agency: According to a dispatch from Madrid, the Spanish government, in order to maintain its neutrality, ordered the mobilization of a part of the national army on the 17th as a precaution. The reservists of the 1940 class were completely assembled on the 16th. According to this mobilization order, the reservists of each class are also being successively recalled and deployed throughout the country.</p>
<p>Madrid, 18th Dispatch from Hai Tong News Agency: The mobilization law signed by Spanish Head of State Franco was officially promulgated this morning. The law authorizes the ministers of the army, navy, and air force to call up men of several age groups and reserve officers to strengthen Spain's defenses. The preamble to the mobilization law states that the current development of the world situation makes wartime increasingly closer to Spain and its territories. In order to prevent this, Spain is implementing necessary measures to maintain peace within our country and protect our sovereignty and inviolable rights. However, the implementation of these measures must be within the possible scope so as not to hinder agricultural, industrial, and economic activities.</p>
<h3>Son of British Secretary of State for India John Amery in Berlin; Will Broadcast to England</h3>
<p>Berlin, 18th Dispatch from Hai Tong News Agency: John Amery, son of British Secretary of State for India Leopold Amery, is currently staying at the Hotel Adlon in Berlin. John was previously in the Free Zone of France. Several weeks ago, he petitioned the German authorities to request a visit to Germany, and he subsequently obtained permission from the authorities. John Amery arrived in Berlin before German troops entered the Free Zone of France. Berlin officials declined to comment on the purpose of his visit to Germany. The only thing that has been confirmed is that the son of the Secretary of State for India opposes Britain's war against Germany.</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th Dispatch from Hai Tong News Agency: German radio said yesterday that the son of a British cabinet member is scheduled to broadcast to England for the first time in Berlin tomorrow evening. His name has not been officially announced. Many believe it refers to John Amery, son of British Secretary of State for India.</p>

<h3>Yarn Industry Petition: Resumption of Spot Trading and Filing of Amended Regulations for Record; Authorities Will Assess for Handling</h3>
<p>Since the rigorous crackdown on speculative businesses in this city, illegal cotton yarn transactions have been repeatedly and explicitly prohibited by the authorities. However, there are many yarn factories, weaving factories, and cloth factories in this city, and merchants from various regions also concentrate their purchases in this city. In fact, both the supply and demand sides genuinely require legitimate spot trading. Since the prohibition order, this has been suspended. The Yarn Trade Association believes that it has always purely regulated the industry, only engaging in spot transactions and not speculation. Its members are all yarn shops dealing in spot cotton yarn, and cannot be compared to speculative brokers. Therefore, Chairman Tang Zhiliang and Supervisor Wen Lanting submitted a petition to the Ministry of Industry, stating that the association is a legitimate trading association. To strictly restrict speculation, it has voluntarily revised its regulations and methods of trading, requesting permission to resume the inter-industry spot trading market and to file the revised regulations for record. After receiving the petition, the Ministry of Industry requested the Shanghai Municipal Government to investigate and report. The Shanghai Municipal Government has instructed the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to assess the actual situation, discuss it, and report back for consideration.</p>
<p>Price Limits on Cotton Yarn and Cloth Announced</p>
<p>According to a report from this city, the Shanghai Price Management Bureau has approved the establishment of maximum wholesale prices for cotton yarn and cotton cloth. The Japanese Consul-General, the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the Shanghai Special Municipal Government will soon issue a joint announcement on this matter. It is said that retail prices will be determined based on the wholesale prices plus the retailers' profit margin. A committee will be established to investigate the quality of goods and set prices. Japanese and Chinese cotton yarn factories in this city have cooperated with the authorities. This measure aims to curb the rise in cotton yarn prices since September. (Note: The maximum price limits for cotton yarn and cotton cloth have been announced; refer to today's Shanghai Municipal Council announcement.)</p>
<h3>Inauguration of the Japanese Imperial Art Association Exhibition Tomorrow</h3>

<h3>Sugar Rationing for Next Month Increased: Total of 25,000 Bags with Deadline for Collecting Certificates and Payment</h3>
<p>In order to make it easier for residents to purchase sugar, the Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office has stipulated that temporary purchases can be made with house tax receipts and citizen certificates. Concrete measures have been drafted for the issue of sugar based on planned household counts and will be implemented after approval by the authorities. The total amount of sugar to be rationed in November has been increased to 25,000 bags. The Cooperative Office has obtained a movement permit from the authorities and will move the sugar to its warehouses for distribution to retailers to maintain the food supply. The rationing regulations are as follows: (1) Purchase certificates will be issued on November 18th, 19th, and 23rd; (2) Retailers will exchange applications for purchase certificates in order to receive sugar; (3) Payment for goods must be made to the designated sugar firm before the 20th; (4) Those who fail to exchange for purchase certificates or fail to pay the designated sugar firm before the deadline will be deemed to have automatically given up and will not be rationed.</p>
<p>Number of Stored Sugar Still Sufficient</p>
<p>Since the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office changed the sales method of sugar in the two concessions, allowing purchases with house tax receipts and citizen certificates, crowding has disappeared. If landlords do not distribute sugar to subtenants according to the number of people, the office should be reported to at the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office on Yangxing Street, and it is believed that the office will take appropriate measures. The amount of stored sugar in this city is still sufficient. The Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office has more than 200,000 bags in its warehouses, and there are more than 100,000 bags stored in various warehouses in this city. Consuming 25,000 bags per month, it is enough for one year's supply, but the color and type of sugar are different.</p>
<p>No Set Pattern for Red and White Sugar Combination</p>
<p>It is also learned that those who purchase sugar with house tax receipts will receive five packages, each weighing five yuan, containing both red and white sugar. Regarding the quantity of red and white sugar combination in the five packages purchased by taxpayers, an employee of the Cooperative Office told the Datong News Agency that there is no fixed pattern. As for the amount of sugar in each package, it is the same: if it is brown sugar, it is one *jin* and three *liang* on the balance scale; if it is white sugar, it is one *jin* and two *liang* on the balance scale. If there is a shortage, it can be reported.</p>
<h3>Baojia Chiefs Inspect Air Defense Equipment</h3>

<p>Business News</p>
<h3>Public Utilities Stocks in Great Demand</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the Chinese stock market, new stocks were still lackluster, while old stocks mostly rose. They have a long history and are easily favored by investors. In addition, credit is not as tight as it has been in the past two weeks, and people's hearts are uneasy. The rise in public utilities is even stronger. There are also rumors of the return of the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant, and it is said that someone has been collecting them, with the price soaring to a high of 47.75 yuan, up two yuan. Huashang Electric also rose by one and a half yuan, reaching 36.25 yuan. Among the cultural stocks, Commercial Press and Zhonghua were thinly traded at fixed prices. The department store sector was mixed. Wing On Company traded at 130 yuan, while Sincere traded at 38 yuan, both up more than one yuan. China Goods Company fell slightly to 233-4 yuan, and Underwear fell 2.5 jiao. The textile industry was in a sluggish state, rising slightly first, then falling back, and finally being slightly weaker than the previous day. Among the new stocks, China-France Pharmacy alone fell by two yuan, to 105 yuan. New Asia (54.5 yuan), Minyi (92.5 yuan), and Zhongxi (470 yuan) all saw increases. China-England traded at 230 yuan, and Great China Match traded at 290 yuan at the last price, up 2.5 yuan. K.Y. Canning traded as low as 52.5 yuan. Other stocks were flat. Trading was thin. Prices are listed below:</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Still Burning</h3>
<p>Over-the-counter trading of government bonds has seen a resurgence. The Gold and Yarn groups are again absorbing large quantities, while most of the industry is just trading in and out frequently. The Central and Communications Banks can now accept mortgages of various stocks, so government bonds are active. It can be seen that although credit is tight, it is only tight for some and loose for others. If this is allowed to continue, the future of the bond market will still recover its inherent prosperity, which is not difficult. Yesterday, Class C initially traded at 5.6 yuan, and immediately rose to around 7 yuan. Although it once fell back to 6.3-4 yuan, it was still pushed up after entering the market, and there was even more than one. The high price was 8.1 yuan, and the last price was 8 yuan. Class A was 4.8 yuan, rising to 5.6 yuan. Class B was 3 yuan, rising to 4.7 yuan. Class D was 1.3 yuan, rising to 3 yuan. Class E was 3 yuan, rising to 4.3 yuan. The above were all the last prices, and they were not easy to buy because it was already 11 o'clock. Due to settlement relations, they gradually dispersed. The estimated turnover was around 2 million yuan. Each bond rose by about 2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Jewelry and Silver Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the retail price of jewelry gold at Dashin Tung jewelry stores in this city did not change, remaining at 2,700 yuan per tael (buying in was reduced by about 300 yuan). Inter-industry trading was 2,500 yuan. After the closing bell, it immediately returned. In the morning, it was 2,500 yuan, 45 yuan high. Then it rose slightly to 2,510 yuan, but was suppressed by the price limit sellers to 2,480 yuan. At noon, it was 2,490 yuan, up 35 yuan from the previous day. It became more firm later, with a difference of 30 yuan. There was little trading. The retail price of sterling silver jewelry was still 14 yuan per tael. Inter-industry trading was 12.9 jiao and 13.3 yuan as the in and out price. The market was also firm.</p>
<p>The interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association remained unchanged at 1.4 jiao. Credit seemed to have eased. The clearing house for negotiable instruments exchanged and collected a total of 71,430 negotiable instruments from November 2nd to 7th, with a total amount of 782,181,199.29 yuan.</p>
<h3>Business Hours for Banks and Money Shops</h3>
<p>Starting Next Month, Change to One Hour Later. It was reported on the 15th that Chinese banks and money shops in this city will implement a one-hour delay (i.e., starting from 10:00 AM) in business hours starting next month. It has now been learned that the joint meeting of the banking and money industries yesterday decided to implement this from December 1st, i.e., the business hours will be from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Factory Cloth Trend Very Stable, Eastern Piece Performance Up Four to Five Yuan</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday, due to the rise of Eastern Piece, factory cloth also rose accordingly. 16-pound Earth Coarse Cloth was quoted at 227-8 yuan, Flying Hong at 221 yuan, 14-pound Earth Coarse Cloth traded at 196 yuan, and 12-pound Earth Fine Cloth traded at 186 yuan. Dapeng Fortune New single cloth also needed 183-4 yuan, an increase of four to five yuan per piece. Peach Blossom Lady Lynn started at 282 yuan and rose to around 290 yuan, with a very stable trend. Poplin and Serge also each quoted one or two jiao higher.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: It started flat and then rose. The market price and the spot price differed too much. Each cloth continued to rise by four to five yuan. 12-pound Dragon Head Fine Cloth, new single cloth was 194 yuan, bank single cloth was 191 yuan, colored ball was 191 yuan, Flying Fish was 189 yuan, Yang Crane was 188 yuan, Five Blessings was 185 yuan, Four Gentlemen Serge Red single cloth started at 7 yuan 3 jiao 3 fen, rising to 7 yuan 5 jiao 7-8 fen.</p>
<h3>Double Horse Switching Warehouse Receipts</h3>
<p>Since the speculation of Double Horse factory receipts was prohibited (starting from November 7th), the gambling activities of general yarn and cloth shops, small companies (except those that only do spot trading), and individuals have completely disappeared. The so-called "flies clinging to carrion" Block (speculative brokers) have completely lost their support and lost their livelihoods. Where is the past heaven and earth?</p>
<p>The Shenxin No. 9 Factory has long published a notice requiring holders of Double Horse factory receipts to go to the factory to exchange for warehouse receipts (i.e., foreign warehouse receipts) before the 20th of this month. It is learned that seven or eight thousand packages have already been exchanged. The first exchange is for the delivery order of Shenxin No. 9 Factory, and then the formal Zhejiang Xingye warehouse receipt is exchanged at the Zhejiang Xingye Bank at the intersection of Beijing Road and Jiangxi Road. It is still necessary to go to the office of the Huiku Office on Suzhou Road to complete the exchange procedures. In addition to the warehouse rent to be paid for the original factory receipt (paid to the factory), a new tax must also be paid, which is 216.8 yuan of Central Reserve Notes per ten packages, and a handling fee of 10 yuan for the Unified Tax Office. (The yellow single Double Horse, spot market, has already started trading, the price is around 6,100 yuan. According to this warehouse receipt, which is commonly referred to as the yellow single in the market, it is regarded as actual goods and spot trading, and can no longer be used for speculation.) (駒)</p>
<h3>Golden Bear Rain Cloth Sells Particularly Well</h3>
<p>Rainproof cloth, because the imported raincoat materials have been cut off, and because it is light in weight and has no rubbery smell, has seen even more vigorous sales since the reduction in public vehicles. However, its selling price has fallen, because of mutual competition and the abundance of products. Yousheng Golden Bear brand, Nanyang gang, and various Western clothing stores in this street all choose to purchase it, because its production standards have no disadvantages of loose manufacturing and inferior quality. The quality is outstanding. It is said that a total of 13,000 yards were sold throughout the city yesterday, directly and indirectly in the morning and afternoon. The selling price per yard was 22 yuan net.</p>
<h3>Business Briefs</h3>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains Market Slightly Active: Yesterday, the market trend was still rising. Chongming Sand Red traded at 257 yuan for 20 packages. Sha Yellow traded at 260 yuan for 50 packages. Wujiang Picked Green traded at 185 yuan for 30 packages. Yuanlong Bean Cake traded at 69.5 yuan per car. Changji Bean Cake traded at 69.75 yuan for 500 pieces.</p>
<p>Southern Peaches, Due to Poor Harvest, Rebound: Since the new Southern Peaches appeared on the market, they initially rose in price due to the scarcity of goods, but then fell by two-tenths due to excessive prices. However, this year's harvest is ultimately thin, so the price has rebounded by 20 yuan in recent days.</p>
<p>Gamber Market Looser than Before: Gamber has seen tighter credit recently, and although the quoted price has not fallen, the market is looser than before. High-grade medium-sized Gamber is selling at 4,850 yuan, and Xingguang small-sized is selling at 4,900 yuan. The market is generally soft.</p>
<p>Hawthorn Slices to Be in Season Soon: News from the Hawthorn Slices production area indicates that new goods have appeared, but the purchase price is not yet determined. It is difficult to fall. In the meantime, the old goods are going through the Cantonese gang, but are not moving, so there is no formal selling price recently. The quoted price is as before, and the trend is sluggish.</p>
<p>Cigarettes Continuously Rationed: Cigarettes still cannot recover, because rationing is continuous, so actual sales are sluggish, and the price is falling. Great Britain brand traded at 8,850 yuan, Old Knife brand at 7,850 yuan, Pinhai brand at 7,800 yuan, Fairy brand at 6,800 yuan, Wuhua brand at 6,600 yuan, Japanese Jinji brand at 2,950 yuan, Jin Dalou at 3,400 yuan, Red Rose at 2,520 yuan, Quanlu brand at 3,100 yuan, Twenty Branches at 2,950 yuan, Double Axe brand at 3,500 yuan, Compass brand at 1,250 yuan, National Cigarette Pyramid at 6,400 yuan, Beautiful brand at 5,500 yuan, Golden Mouse brand at 3,900 yuan, and Platinum Dragon at 4,000 yuan. In addition to the price increase, the rest are mixed.</p>
<p>Local Iron Nail Trading Clear: The local iron nail has only seen scattered trading in door stores recently. Wholesale sales are unremarkable, so the market is sluggish and lackluster. The standard Bess is still quoted at 700 yuan per barrel, and the retail price in door stores is 7 yuan to 7.5 yuan per pound.</p>
<h3>New Industrial and Commercial Works</h3>
<p>Publication of the National Trade Association Investigation Record: Mr. Xu Wancheng's recently compiled "National Trade Association Investigation Record" covers all groups, addresses, association affairs, and names of directors and secretaries of industrial and commercial associations, chambers of commerce, and other organizations in the local and foreign regions. It was published yesterday for 25 yuan per copy, distributed by the Longwen Bookstore in the Yanye Building on Beijing Road.</p>

<h3>Overwintering of Deciduous Plants</h3>
<p>— Jiang Yingshi</p>
<p>Although it is "Autumn ends, Jiangnan grass does not wither," if someone says that winter will not come, or that this year's winter will be as warm as spring, that is either a fool or a charlatan trying to amaze people.</p>
<p>Once winter arrives, the leaves of the French plane trees that are most common in Shanghai parks and roadsides begin to fall off in large quantities: until midwinter, they fall off cleanly. At that time, sensitive people walking in the park or on the road cannot help but feel some sorrow.</p>
<p>But sorrow only comes from people's intuition about deciduous plants. In fact, deciduous plants have not given up the struggle for survival. In winter, because the amount of water that can be absorbed is scarce, and the air is dry and evaporation is severe, if they want to maintain the existence of many leaves, the plant body will inevitably lack water, resulting in dry branches and leaves. Therefore, they would rather let the leaves fall, and store the power of life, standing upright in the cold wind and snow, waiting for the arrival of spring. When spring comes, they will sprout and grow leaves, and form a beautiful spring scene with other creatures.</p>
<p>What would happen if deciduous plants did not lose their leaves or did not accumulate energy even though they lost their leaves? Of course, they would die in the severe winter, or they would not be able to be active in the spring. But plants rarely have this situation, which is common in humans.</p>
<p>Family</p>
<h3>Reading and Eating Books</h3>
<p>— Chonghua</p>
<p>— Two Diary Entries —</p>
<p>After December 8th last year, transportation between Shanghai and Chongqing was cut off, and my father hadn't sent money back for several months. Our family's life depended solely on meager savings, barely managing for several months. After the currency reform on June 21st, we felt even more difficulty in our lives.</p>
<p>Summer vacation is almost over, and school is about to start again. We simply have no way to pay for the tuition of me and my three older brothers.</p>
<p>One evening, my mother and I went to the home of Uncle Liu, a close friend of my father, to discuss the issue of our tuition. After discussing it, we decided to sell a copy of the "Sibu Congkan" (Collected Works in Four Branches of Literature) from our family's collection to use as our tuition. My mother also agreed.</p>
<p>My father loves buying books the most; almost all the money he earned was spent on books. These books represent my father's lifelong efforts and are also our family's only property. I never dreamed that we would sell them now for our education.</p>
<p>Today, Uncle Liu came to move the books. My three older brothers and I carried the already wrapped packages of books, one package at a time, onto the rickshaw. With tears in our eyes, we watched the strong rickshaw puller take away my father's lifelong efforts, our family's precious property. Turning back to look at my mother's worried face, I couldn't help but secretly shed tears. What was the price obtained from these books? It paid for the tuition of the four of us, with the remainder being insufficient for a month's household expenses. We barely got through this semester. What about next semester's tuition? What about next month's living expenses? Ah! I dare not think further. (Evening of July 30th diary entry)</p>
<p>Autumn is over, and winter has come again. I, as a child, muddled through the past few months. During these months, living expenses have continued to rise. Rice sells for seven hundred yuan per dan (a unit of dry measure), coal briquettes sell for twenty-six yuan per dan, and my father still hasn't sent a penny back. Our family's life, though we receive a small loan from a friend each month, is simply not enough.</p>
<p>Last week, my mother and I went to Uncle Liu's house again to discuss the issue of food. As a result, we had to sell books again, as before. Although our family has quite a few books, only the "Twenty-Four Histories" published by Zhonghua Book Company can be sold for money. As long as the price is lower than the current price in bookstores, there is no need to worry about finding a buyer.</p>
<p>Three days ago, Uncle Liu came and said, "Someone already wants the books. Please bring them out quickly and send them to my house in a couple of days." Last night, my brothers and I sorted through this set of books together, our hearts filled with sorrow. It seemed that the time this "Twenty-Four Histories" could stay in our home was less than twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>This morning, I went to school to attend classes. When I came back for lunch, the books were no longer there. I silently finished my meal and walked upstairs with a wounded heart. I thought: this "Twenty-Four Histories" will at most last until the end of this year. If my father still hasn't sent money back next year, what will we do about our education and livelihood? (November 14th diary entry)</p>
<h3>Riding in the Same Boat Through Wind and Rain</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>— An Enemy Family</p>
<p>In the Shuangmei Study, the atmosphere had changed. It was harmonious, exciting, and novel. Huang Long was somewhat like an official who appointed himself, he was both the dealer and the caller, shouting "one-five-nine," "four-eight," "seven clusters," "next dealer." He was dealt two cards in total, but he was still reluctant to reveal them all at once. First, he blew on his finger, then used his finger to pick up the card, and then stacked one card on top of another, then energetically moved it to the palm of his left hand; then he shouted, and then brought his finger and palm close to his face, focusing his gaze sharply to look at one card, while the other card was left to be viewed by his finger. This way of looking at cards, A Xing and He Zixing had often seen it before, but Cui Zhen and Magpie, having seen it for the first time, were surprised and laughed. With a laugh, they didn't care about losing or winning money, feeling that losing a few coins was nothing. This kind of happiness had been absent from the Ye family for quite some time.</p>
<p>Huang Long was the dealer, and it was Wei Cheng's turn to be the dealer. Huang Long introduced him from the side: "This is young master Ye. If you want to win money, don't care if he is young master Ye or second young master Ye. Aim accurately at the card path and place a single bet fiercely. If you draw a one-six and a long two, the dealer draws a one-five and a long two, hahaha, the money is yours. One-five, ten, fifteen, twenty, the money all goes into your pockets. Come on! You recognize young master Ye, but the money doesn't recognize young master Ye. If you have the ability, just win his money. After winning his money, you still have to thank you." Huang Long's words were quick and loud, and he seemed to be in a leading position. He first placed a single bet of ten yuan on the upper hand, and everyone followed him, betting with laughter. As a result, the underdog won, and Huang Long became even more carried away. In this way, A Xing and He Zixing had both been dealers. The money came and went like the tide, with no big wins or losses. Second Madam Ye walked out from the inner room and said, "You've been playing for a while, you can rest now, right? Play again tomorrow. Wei Cheng's health isn't fully recovered yet." Huang Long was really not satisfied with this small win, and hearing Second Madam Ye say this, he stopped there, saying, "Second Aunt, you say tomorrow is today. Today is the first day of the Lunar New Year. Look, the east is turning white." (233)</p>

<h3>A Prostitute's Confession</h3>
<p>— Yu Zhen</p>
<p>Respected Editor:</p>
<p>I don't know how to address you, because we are too eager for your busyness. Editor: I have always admired your fairness and enthusiasm for society, and your willingness to write for the suffering people, so I wrote this immature piece, which is a humble cry of pain! I hope you will revise it and publish it in a corner of your newspaper, so as to correct the general public's misconception of us. I would be extremely grateful! With best wishes to you, Editor! Yours sincerely, Yu Zhen</p>
<p>(1) For the sake of life, forcing a smile.</p>
<p>I am a so-called prostitute who has long been abandoned by society, scorned by people, and will always be despised, standing on the street soliciting customers. My motivation for writing this article is not to seek any material assistance, but to explain to the general public their misunderstanding of us.</p>
<p>We are often scolded and despised by the general public. And they add all kinds of vicious terms to us. What "rotten bitch, fickle," "heartless prostitute, lowlife," and many more. Alas! I won't say it. Anyway, such terms are not glorious. We really don't understand why the general public is so hard on us.</p>
<p>They say we are "familiar with new faces and intimate with old ones, changing masters morning and night." Yes, this is a fact. But I want to ask a question, a customer stays for one night and gives us some limited compensation, and then doesn't come the next day. Can we rely on this limited amount of money to make a living and starve ourselves to maintain chastity for them? What else can we do but change masters morning and night? They all come to us with the mentality of solving their sexual desires, spending a few worthless coins to get what they need. The next day they leave and become strangers from then on. How can we offer them true love? What else can we do but be familiar with new faces and intimate with old ones? Some people accuse us of being born prostitutes for sending off one and welcoming another. God knows! Were we born to be prostitutes? Do we prostitute ourselves out of our own free will? If we had a bowl of rice to eat, I believe no one would be willing to subject their innocent bodies to be trampled upon by others without freedom, to be servile and please others; to hold back a mouthful of tears while forcing themselves to smile. I think, really, if it weren't for the sake of life, no one would be willing to do this! (To be continued. Proceeds will go to helping students)</p>
