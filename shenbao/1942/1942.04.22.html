<p>印度問題專輯</p>
<h3>五內部的組成</h3>
<p>本節我們所要敘述的，是印度內部的組成。本來所謂內部的組成，可以包括人口，宗敎，經濟，政治等　端，唯人口，宗敎，經濟等構成情形，其他各節大體都已講到，所以這篇所要說的只限於政治的一門。大家知道，印度迄今還是英國的殖民地。反映於政治方面的，一面是英國的統治，一面是印度人民爭自由爭獨立的鬥爭。我們將後者留到「政黨與重要人物」的一節中予以剖釋，這裏僅就英國統治印度的情形，加以敘述。</p>
<p>英國統治印度，主要的把牠分爲兩部：一是英屬印度，由印度政府直接管轄之；一是印度各部，由當地王公秉承英方意旨統治之。印度面積，共計一，七六六，五九七方里，此中一，〇八七，二〇四方里，就是英國的直轄部分；所餘的六七八，三九三方里，則爲當地王公統治的範圍。大略的分，三分之二是屬於前者，三分之一是屬於後者。</p>
<p>英屬印度，以幅員遼闊，由印度政府將之分爲十一個大省，六個小省。其中重要的，有麻得拉斯省，孟買省，朋各爾省，亞加拉省，奧達省，彭札省，比哈省，奧尼薩省，中央省，阿薩密省等等。每省置省長一人，直接聽命於印度政府。省政府爲省行政機關，此外尙有一個省議會，具有立法的性質。</p>
<p>印度各部，爲王公統治的範國。內部行政，表面上頗具獨立的色彩，如王公可以自擁軍隊，自攬稅政等等，但在另一方面，他又必須尊重印度政府之宗主權。同時，印度政府對於這些王公統治的區域，亦不肯放鬆其實際上的按制力。他們除派遣政治顧問常在駐在王公政府之所在地，幫同王公處理政務外，並於約法上規定王公與王公間不得私自結盟，亦不得與外國訂立任何條約。所以王公所轄之印度各部，名爲獨立，實則還是附庸的。這些區城中，共有七百內外的市鎭，分爲若干大小不同的政治單位。大者如海得拉巴，買案爾，巴羅達，加契麻，乍那烏，拉不達那等，都有其獨自的統治者（王公），而這些統治者即直接與印度政府發生聯擊，小者甚至只有幾方里的土地，雖亦受其獨自的王公的管轄，但這些王公只能與印度政府直轄的省政府保持聯絡，不能直接與印度政府來往。孟買省政府轄下的這類小王公統治區，就有三百五十四個之多。麻得拉斯省較少，但也有五個。</p>
<p>統治印度的最高機關，如上所述，就是印度政府。其首領便是印度總督，故印度政府，俗又稱之爲總督府。印度總督，名義上爲英王所遣派，任期五年，集所有行政的大權於一身。政府組織，頗似民治國家的內閣。共中分有六部，有財政部，有敎育·衛生·土地部，有鐵路·商業·宗敎部，有工業·勞工部，有內政部，有司法部。每部置部長一人，直接由於英廷的委任，任期亦爲五年。最近閣員數目，較前增加，但多是不管部的。此外尙有一個印度軍總司令，率領印度境內之英籍印籍部隊並主持戰略事宜。位總司令，也是閣內之當然閣員，但於戰略事宜上，不受印度總督的節制。</p>
<p>印度政府可以算是印度的行政機關，此外尙有立法機關。立法機關可以分有上下兩院。下院又名爲國民大會（Couneil　of　srate），議員有六十人，其中之三十四人是由於選舉的，二十六人是由於政府指定的；上院又名爲立法院（The　Legis　Latrve　Assembly），有隊員一百四十四人，其中之一百零四人是由於選舉的，四十人是由於政府指定的。政府閣員，也有作爲議員的資格，出席上下兩院，其任期與一般議員同，都是五年。</p>
<p>由此說來，印度政府內部組織，好似與一般民治國家沒有什麽不同，實則又有差別·第一，印度雖有行政機關，但一切命令的頒佈，都以總督之名行之，實際上也由總督負其全責。第二，印度雖也有立法機關，審會議各種要事件，但立法機關的決議，並無一定可使政府執行的權力，換一句話說，印度總督的意旨反可推翻立法機關的決議。這是印度政府組織的特殊情形，由此也可以看出英國統治印度的實質。</p>
<p>至於在此統治之下，印度人民的反應爲如何？印度人民革命運動的組成如何？我們留於「政黨與重要人物」的一節中再述，這節且止於此了。</p>

<h3>美對維希　將發聲明</h3>
<p>華盛頓二十一日路透社電路透社記者探悉、美國對於維希政策之聲明、自十八日起即在草擬中、大約今日可予發表、該聲明或將依照去年五月羅斯福總統對法國人民演說之意見、再度向法人呼籲、羅總統曾謂維希與德國之合作、認爲不可想像之事、此問外交界人士之意見以爲賴伐爾裝腔作勢、試與文戰國維持和平關係亦有可能、蓋渠可以藉以欺騙法國人民、渠已在此方面盡其最大努力、終鮮成效、而後始與德國合作云、但此　姿態固不能欺騙美國人民也、</p>

<h3>房租改收新鈔後仍應折合原租金數　如全書改收新鈔無異變相加租當局派員徹查以防杜規避禁令若干業主已取消前議仍收舊鈔</h3>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、作（二十日）悉、本市主要地產公司已通知其租戶、謂租金將照常以法幣取取、而新訂租約亦將訂明以法幣爲基礎、近數週來地產公司與租戶日形緊張之情勢、　吿遂弛、其他地產公司欲收儲鈔者、將繼續以此鈔收取、但須依據現行兌換率以法幣爲基礎折合之、至於阻戶因誤會而已以儲鈔作法幣等價付租者、其照市升水之款數、將歸還租戶、而在四月租金金中扣除之、蓋遵照市政當局之調解辦法而行也、</p>
<p>非法暴利租戶反抗</p>
<p>按地南公司與租戶問之新糾紛、係從本月初開始、緣三月杪法幣興儲鈔之等價取消、地產公司立即通知租戶須以儲鈔收租、然並不照兌換率打何折扣、市政當局旋亦宣佈一切捐稅、須照兌換率折合以儲鈔付給、目禁止業主於三月杪之前增加租金、乃業主利用此兩因素爲理由、於收租時索取同額之儲鈔、於是租戶大譁、指責業主此種獨斷獨行、爲非法暴利、雙方發生爭鬥、</p>
<p>派員調查防杜加租</p>
<p>致使市政當局有特別委員會之設立、澈底　查此事之舉、廣泛調査之結果、發現若干地產公司之加租要求、實無根據、預料當局不久將續施調整、俾便祛除對於鈔儲使用條例之誤解、並防杜若干不法業主對加租禁例、陽奉陰違、</p>
<p>殷盼當局確實政策</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、頃向市政當道與地產界探悉、本市房租收取法幣與儲鈔問題、尙無一般的切實解決辦法、雖公共租界工部局與法租界公董局房租委員會、聞已在討論此問題、但料非待整個貨幣問題澄淸、未能獲致解決、據消息難通人十稱、本市房租情勢、今在變動狀態之中、許多地產公司現案取儲鈔、亦有擬自五月一日起改收儲鈔、更有　仍收法幣若、各方刻皆期待當局宣布關於此事之獲定政策云、</p>
<p>目下租金可分四類</p>
<p>又據法公董局人士答記者稱、凡有租約訂定租金以法幣付給者、一般地產行現仍接受法幣、惟已通知租戶、謂今後新租金、將以儲鈔收取、屆時是否能以儲鈔收取、或將視屆時之貨　情勢而定、按月收租之地產公司似已分爲四類、　從未要求收取儲鈔、　曾提此要求而旋予撤銷、　已通知在不久將來收取備鈔（從五月一日起者居多）、　業已收取儲鈔、</p>
<p>情勢複雜有待發展</p>
<p>由是　之、情勢頗爲複雜、而幣制情勢如有新發展、此種情勢或將完全改觀、例如日後如經決定一切房租、概以儲鈔照其對法幣之兌換率折合付給、則租戶現已支付儲鈔者、日後可照兌換率减低付給、據工部局發言人今（二十一日）晨表示、該局不久或將發出關於此事之通吿、</p>
<h3>銀行聯合準備會　調劑現鈔籌碼　對各行莊酌量平掉　於昨日起開始實行</h3>

<h3>市民證　下月頒發　戶口調查將竣事</h3>
<p>工部局　務處爲實施保甲制度、於本年二月十五日起、開始調査公共租界戶口、茲悉此項調査工作、即可於本月底完畢、警務處並將依照調査結果、演密查核、而後發給市民證、發給時期約在五月中旬、此項市民設上、計塡明所屬之某保某甲、目前住址、姓名、年齡、職業等、居民領得此證後、即須隨身携帶、以備緊急時證明身份之用、故此證頒發後、即可防止不良份子之混入租界、盜賊之風可望稍戢、而公衆盼望已久之計口授糧制度、亦將依此爲根據而逐漸推行、至於法租界方面、對於保甲制度之　備、決與公共租界採取平行行動、處處互相呼應、戶口調查、正在順利進行、而市民蹬與計口投糧制、亦在計劃之中、若干方面雖否認法當局有舉辦自警團之意、然不久將來、法租界當亦有相似性質之健全組繼出現、或將根據已有之出正及里弄糾察等組織、擴充而加强之、總之、兩租界當局對於保甲制度之推行、於原則上完全一致、僅實施辦法稍有不同、工作進行略見遲早而已、</p>

<p>游藝界</p>
<h3>蓓蒂黛維絲當選影后</h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>整個世界雖有着戰雲籠罩着，但好萊塢的一切，還是依然如故，祇是空氣緊張一些而已。尤其是過去一年中，關於名片及影人演技的名次，照例是準時評選，而陸續地發表。因爲交通關係，我們所得的消息，是沒有往年的詳細而已。特別可指出的，女明星蓓蒂黛維絲是當選了一九四一年的電影皇后，復得無上的榮譽。</p>
<p>蓓蒂黛維絲的藝術如何，這裹小想介紹了，因爲大家都知道的，用不到多說了。她在銀幕上演戲，雖然已有相當久的歷史，但她的演技竟跟着時代，不斷的進步，不像別人那樣短促。在很短的幾年之中，她曾連獲三次電影藝術科學研究院的最佳演技獎，更是難得，而最近又獲選影后，眞所謂錦上添花了。她的獲得褒獎，當選影后，並非出於偶然，主要的原因，她對於電影藝術，能孜孜不倦的日夜研究，一些沒有傲慢。就是在銀幕下面的生活，也不像別的女明星，毫無浪漫跡象，在交際塲中，是難得看見她足跡的，眞可稱爲「潔身自好」了。</p>
<p>現在，蓓蒂黛維絲已是三十歲以外的人了，從事銀幕，屈指已有十年，論理，她是將衰退了，可是事實却不然，相反的，竟格外聞名。翻開好萊塢的電影史，像這樣的女明星，人數是不多吧？最近她所主演的影片固不多，每一個年頭祇三五部，但我們每次看到她的片子，總覺得她的面貌，她的演技，什麼都使人可愛。尤其是演戲的認眞，一些也不假借，這大概是她成爲一代藝人的主因吧？</p>
<h3>僕歐出身的　靑年導演</h3>
<p>— 于藝</p>
<p>米高梅影片公司台柱女星瑙瑪希拉的丈夫伊爾文泰堡，靑年時代使任影片重要監製人，蜚聲好萊塢；中年，地位益髙，不啻米髙梅的靈魂，已成美國影界首屈一指的監製人。不幸病魔把他的生命奪去，影界莫不同聲惋惜，並嘆靑年良才的不可多得。</p>
<p>事隔幾年，好萊塢已發現後起之秀，幹練有爲，一般舉爲可與靑年時代的伊爾文泰堡媲美。此人姓魏特納，名威廉，欃二十三歲，已任共和影片公司的導演，近作「金槍神鞭，」現方映於大華戲院。</p>
<p>魏特納能有今日的地位，完全是刻苦自勵的酬報。兩年前，他還在寫字間當僕歐，利用職務上的便利，學習影業的種種訣巧。算起出身來，可說是低微極了。當時，他因工作勤懇，得監製人的賞識，調人剪接間服務，先充助手，嗣昇剪接員，得暇便孜孜研究攝影，角度和燈光等技術，不久，藝果大成，智識經騐，都很豐富，經監製人的識拔，充任助理導演，頗多新的供獻。日後若能加倍努力，當有較「金槍神鞭」更有意義的作品問世，前途眞未可限量呢。</p>

<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（三）客至</p>
<p>明天，孝幃裹又繼續聽得翠珍的哭聲，把維城驚醒。維城在等待着費長河的駕臨。他問過葉二太太，家裹沒有多少錢，怕不能饜足費長河的慾望。但想到費長河也不會眞的來向他要翠珍姊全部的飯錢。這一天，晴日照滿了一庭，氣候是轉暖了，葉大太太靈前點着的香，飄出一縷來，輕輕的，緩緩的。喜鵲走過來問：「少爺，你鞋上沾了好些泥，要不換一雙舊鞋來穿了，把脚上的鞋脫下，給你刷一刷。」維城彎彎腰，看一雙白布鞋上，果然有了不少泥淤，便問道：「誰叫你來問的？」喜鵲道：「翠珍小姐。」維城道：「讓它去吧，穿素，也談不上整潔了。」</p>
<p>他負手走到外邊來，沒出二門，阿興帶了一個人進來。阿興在前，說：一維城當是費長河，連忙對阿興身後一看。啊！正是在風雨之夕預約到了新年裹來訪問的陳國芳女士。國芳的來，在維城意料之中的，可是見了面，還不由各自一怔。國芳穿着，件黑色的厚呢大衣，脖子裏圍了一條花花綠綠的圍巾，下邊是齊着踝骨以上的旗袍，脚上是一雙鏤了許多孔的黑皮鞋。國芳走近一步，別的不說，單說怎麽啦怎麼啦。維城道：「先母去世了！」這一聲說了，再也說不下去。他只伸手出來，和國芳相握了一下。國芳道：「家兄也病了，不能來。啊，人事怎麼變遷得這麽快的？」維城只是搖着頭，差一些要把淚珠子滾下來。阿興道：「還是請這位小姐上會客間裹去坐吧。」一句話提醒了維城。（五五）</p>

<h3>Three US Aircraft Carriers Appear in the Western Pacific; Japanese Headquarters Announces Air Raid Details</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Domei News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced yesterday at 5:50 PM that three enemy aircraft carriers, escorted by a fleet, were discovered in the Western Pacific on the 18th of this month. Fearing a Japanese counterattack, they retreated before approaching the Japanese coast. On the same day, approximately ten enemy aircraft, identified as North American B-25s, appeared singly or in pairs over Tokyo and several other locations. Those not shot down likely escaped towards mainland China. Damage from the bombings was minimal, it was reported.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Domei News Agency) – The enemy air raid on Japanese territory on the 18th was largely ineffective due to the calm response of the Japanese air defense authorities and the entire populace. Enemy aircraft were either destroyed or fled towards China. According to a battle report from the [blank] Flying Squadron, at 12:12 PM on the 18th, information was received that two enemy aircraft had appeared over Mito. The squadron immediately deployed to the Tokyo-Yokohama area to intercept them. After an hour, a North American B-25 type enemy aircraft with a malfunctioning engine was spotted heading west at an altitude of about 1,000 meters or less. The attack commenced over the waters off Shinagawa. The enemy aircraft descended, while ground anti-aircraft batteries also opened heavy fire. The enemy aircraft further reduced altitude in an attempt to escape, while returning fire with machine guns. It fled along the [blank] River into the sea, its altitude at less than 100 meters. Fearing pursuit, the enemy aircraft hastily dropped several remaining bombs and began to climb. The Japanese aircraft pursued closely, attacking fiercely to prevent escape, until they reached the waters near Izu Oshima. The enemy aircraft’s right engine emitted black smoke, and it slowly nosedived, suddenly plunging into a cloudbank ahead and disappearing from sight. Based on the circumstances at the time, it is undoubtedly believed that the enemy aircraft could not have escaped far and has crashed into the sea. Furthermore, according to Lieutenant Umekawa of the [blank] Unit, regarding the air combat situation on that day, "At 12:50 PM on the 18th, while we were flying over Mito Airfield, we spotted an enemy aircraft flying south at low altitude. We immediately launched a fierce attack. The enemy aircraft, hit by bullets, leaked fuel and fled to the skies over Chiba Prefecture’s Chigata Airfield, where it eventually caught fire and crashed to low altitude before fleeing towards the sea. We were unable to continue the pursuit due to fuel limitations, which is deeply regrettable. Based on the circumstances at the time, it is undoubtedly believed that the aircraft has crashed into the sea."</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops on Panay Island Occupy Calinog; Iloilo City Reduced to Scorched Earth</h3>
<p>Manila, 21st (Domei News Agency) – According to a reconnaissance report from the Japanese Army, a certain unit pursuing enemy forces on the Panay plain occupied Calinog, a strategic point in the central Panay plain (located 65 kilometers north of Iloilo), on the afternoon of the 19th. The American and Filipino military bases of Taytes and Olamide were set ablaze, creating intense fires, with smoke rising high above central Panay.</p>
<p>Washington, [blank] 21st (Reuters) – The US Army Department announced this morning that American forces on Panay Island (Philippines), outnumbered, have retreated from two positions in Antique Province.</p>
<p>Iloilo, 19th (Domei News Agency) – Iloilo, a major sugar-producing area accounting for about 70% of the Philippines' production, has suffered severe damage due to arson by American and Filipino forces. Only a portion of the residential area remains untouched. The former factories and city streets are now a scene of scorched earth, with black smoke lingering everywhere, a truly tragic sight. Tens of thousands of piculs of sugar stored in sugar mills and along the coast have melted in the fire and turned into liquid, flowing across the streets.</p>
<p>Washington, 20th (Havas) – According to a recent announcement by the Army Department, Japanese dive bombers attacked Corregidor Island in the Philippines five times in the past 24 hours.</p>
<h3>Curtin and MacArthur Hold Secret Talks</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 21st (Haitong News Agency) – Australian Prime Minister Curtin held a meeting with General MacArthur, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific, at Allied Headquarters yesterday. The meeting lasted three hours. Australian Army Chief of Staff General Blamey and US Major General Sutherland were also present. Sutherland is MacArthur’s Chief of Staff. The content of the meeting is being kept strictly confidential.</p>
<h3>US Army Exercises in Panama Canal Zone</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Haitong News Agency) – According to the US Army Department's announcement in Washington yesterday, large-scale exercises in the Panama Canal Zone, unprecedented since the start of the war, have concluded.</p>
<h3>Japan Issues Wartime Bonds Worth 550 Million Yen</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Domei News Agency) – The Greater East Asia War Bonds, totaling 555 million yen, will be sold at post offices throughout the Japanese Empire from the 23rd of this month for twelve days. The bonds bear an interest rate of 3.5% and will be repaid in thirteen years.</p>
<h3>Provinces Report Good Harvests This Spring</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 21st – According to reports from various locations received by the Ministry of Food, Minister Wang Shijie of the Central Propaganda Department hosted foreign journalists at 3:00 PM on the 21st, stating that most provinces have reported generally good harvests this spring. In Sichuan alone, in addition to wheat, the harvest of beans and other miscellaneous grains this spring is also satisfactory.</p>
<h3>Marshall Returns Home to Report on London Conference; British First Sea Lord Pound Arrives in the US; US Air Force Decides to Provide Effective Assistance to Britain</h3>
<p>Washington, 20th (Havas) – US Army Chief of Staff General Marshall and Lend-Lease Administrator Hopkins, after returning from London, visited President Roosevelt today to report on the discussions with British military leaders. They also had lunch with the President at the White House. US Ambassador to Britain Winant was also present.</p>
<p>Washington, 21st (Reuters) – US Army Chief of Staff General Marshall was accompanied by four secret passengers on his return from Britain. It is now known that one of them is British First Sea Lord Admiral Pound. General Marshall also told reporters yesterday that his trip to Britain was "very satisfactory."</p>
<p>Washington, 20th (Havas) – US Army Chief of Staff General Marshall and Lend-Lease Administrator Hopkins have returned to the country after recently attending a meeting with the British General Staff in London. Military sources here commented on the results of their trip, saying that US participation in the European war will be limited to engaging in guerrilla warfare and accelerating the supply of military goods to Britain. The US is not yet ready for large-scale participation in the European war. In the future, US forces will only participate in "surprise attacks" on coastal areas of the European continent, and US aircraft will also participate in bombing European industrial centers; that’s all. In essence, the assistance that the US can provide to Britain will be mainly in the air force, because only aircraft can be transported to Britain in a short period of time, without worrying about the submarine threat. Most heavy bombers fly directly from the US to Britain, and this measure also benefits the Soviet Union. After US aircraft participate in the European war, the German army will have to transfer part of its aircraft from the Eastern Front to deal with them. At the same time, German wartime production will be greatly reduced due to the joint bombing by the British and American air forces. This situation will indirectly benefit the Soviet Union’s war of resistance.</p>
<h3>Hull's Remarks</h3>
<p>Washington, 21st (Reuters) – US Secretary of State Hull returned to work yesterday after recovering from illness and stated that the Allied nations should use the slogan "Let's move forward immediately, don't wait for tomorrow." The United States' war efforts have achieved results in recent months, which is extremely gratifying. The production of munitions and materials has made particular progress. The United States' production volume is far greater than expected. Allied soldiers will be able to defeat the Axis powers sooner with these weapons.</p>
<h3>US Study Group Begins Work in India; Discusses Military Supply Issues with British Authorities</h3>
<p>New Delhi, 21st (Reuters) – The expert study group led by former US Undersecretary of State Grady, which arrived here last Friday, met yesterday with Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar, head of the Department of Supply of the Viceroy’s Executive Council, and other officials of the department. The Indian munitions procurement representative to the United States, Sir Girja Shankar Bajpai, was also present to discuss general Indian military supply issues. It was decided that the US study group would conduct an investigation to report the necessary measures to the US government immediately. The study group will begin work in New Delhi and will meet with several officials and prominent industrialists before inspecting the actual situation in two or three industrial areas.</p>
<p>Cripps Returns to London</p>
<p>London, 21st (Reuters) – Sir Stafford Cripps, Lord Privy Seal and special envoy to India, has returned to Britain from New Delhi via Cairo and Lisbon.</p>
<p>Indian Affairs Special</p>
<h3>The Composition of the Internal Structure</h3>
<p>In this section, we are going to describe the internal structure of India. Originally, the so-called internal structure can include population, religion, economy, politics, and other aspects. However, the population, religion, economy, and other aspects have been generally discussed in other sections. Therefore, what this article will say is limited to the field of politics. Everyone knows that India is still a British colony. Reflected in the political aspect is the British rule on one hand, and the Indian people's struggle for freedom and independence on the other. We will leave the latter to be analyzed in the section "Political Parties and Important Figures," and here we will only describe the situation of British rule in India.</p>
<p>The British rule India mainly by dividing it into two parts: one is British India, directly governed by the Indian government; the other is the Indian states, ruled by local princes acting on the instructions of the British. The area of India totals 1,766,597 square miles, of which 1,087,204 square miles are directly administered by the British; the remaining 678,393 square miles are ruled by local princes. Roughly speaking, two-thirds belong to the former, and one-third belongs to the latter.</p>
<p>British India is vast in area, so the Indian government divides it into eleven large provinces and six small provinces. Among the important ones are Madras Province, Bombay Province, Bengal Province, Agra Province, Oudh Province, Punjab Province, Bihar Province, Orissa Province, Central Provinces, Assam Province, and so on. Each province has a governor who reports directly to the Indian government. The provincial government is the administrative organ of the province, and there is also a provincial council, which has legislative powers.</p>
<p>The Indian states are areas ruled by princes. Internal administration has a seemingly independent character, such as princes being able to have their own armies and collect taxes, but on the other hand, they must respect the suzerainty of the Indian government. At the same time, the Indian government is unwilling to relax its actual control over these princely states. In addition to sending political advisors who are stationed in the capital of the princely government to assist the prince in handling government affairs, it is also stipulated in the covenant that princes cannot form alliances with each other or enter into any treaties with foreign countries. Therefore, the Indian states under the jurisdiction of the princes are nominally independent, but in reality, they are still vassals. There are about 700 towns and cities in these areas, divided into several political units of different sizes. Larger ones, such as Hyderabad, Mysore, Baroda, Kashmir, Travancore, Rajputana, etc., have their own rulers (princes), and these rulers have direct contact with the Indian government. Smaller ones, even with only a few square miles of land, are also governed by their own princes, but these princes can only maintain contact with the provincial governments directly under the Indian government and cannot directly deal with the Indian government. The Bombay Provincial Government has as many as 354 such princely states under its jurisdiction. Madras Province has fewer, but there are also five.</p>
<p>The highest governing body in India, as mentioned above, is the Indian government. Its head is the Governor-General of India, so the Indian government is also commonly known as the Viceroy's Office. The Governor-General of India is nominally dispatched by the British monarch for a term of five years and holds all executive powers. The government organization is quite similar to the cabinet of a democratic country. It is divided into six departments: the Department of Finance, the Department of Education, Health and Land, the Department of Railways, Commerce and Religion, the Department of Industry and Labor, the Department of Interior, and the Department of Justice. Each department has a minister appointed directly by the British government for a term of five years. Recently, the number of cabinet members has increased compared to the past, but many are ministers without portfolio. In addition, there is a Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army, who leads the British and Indian troops in India and presides over strategic matters. The Commander-in-Chief is also a member of the cabinet, but on strategic matters, he is not subject to the control of the Governor-General of India.</p>
<p>The Indian government can be regarded as the administrative organ of India, and there is also a legislative organ. The legislative organ can be divided into two houses: the lower house, also known as the Council of State, has sixty members, of whom thirty-four are elected and twenty-six are appointed by the government; the upper house, also known as the Legislative Assembly, has 144 members, of whom 104 are elected and 40 are appointed by the government. Government cabinet members are also qualified to be members of parliament, attending both houses, and their term of office is the same as that of general members, which is five years.</p>
<p>From this point of view, the internal organization of the Indian government seems to be no different from that of a general democratic country, but in reality, there are differences. First, although India has an administrative organ, all orders are issued in the name of the Governor-General, and in fact, the Governor-General bears full responsibility for them. Second, although India also has a legislative organ that deliberates on various important matters, the resolutions of the legislative organ do not necessarily have the power to compel the government to implement them. In other words, the will of the Governor-General of India can overturn the resolutions of the legislative organ. This is the special situation of the Indian government organization, which also shows the essence of British rule in India.</p>
<p>As for the response of the Indian people under this rule and the composition of the Indian people's revolutionary movement, we will discuss them in the section "Political Parties and Important Figures." This section will end here.</p>
<h3>France Determined to Faithfully Fulfill Amity and Understanding with Germany; Laval Clarifies Policy Guidelines; Yesterday Accompanied Finance Minister on a Trip to Paris</h3>
<p>Vichy, 21st (Haitong News Agency) – French government leader Laval is scheduled to travel to Paris today with Finance Minister Bouthillier. Vichy, 21st (Haitong News Agency) – Laval departed from Vichy this morning, apparently for Paris. Laval will stay in Paris at the former presidential palace, the world-renowned "Champs-Élysées."</p>
<p>Vichy, 20th (Havas) – The new head of government, Laval, delivered a radio address to the nation today, clarifying future policy guidelines, declaring that he will promote an independent and autonomous diplomacy and strive for understanding and amity with Germany. He said, "I have been involved in political work for a long time and have experienced major difficult periods during France's life and death. I remember that in 1936, I resigned from the post of Prime Minister and left the country. At that time, France was strong and respected by everyone. However, in the following three years, some party leaders, ignorant of current affairs, acted solely on emotions and even conspired to harm the country. The greatest sin was declaring war on Germany, which eventually led to defeat and caused the country to suffer great pain, almost to the point of national collapse. Until recently, I was ordered by General Pétain to handle state affairs under his leadership, and I met you again here. Admiral Darlan will also represent the head of state and command the three armed forces. In the future, I will do everything possible to save France. I am not responsible for the misfortunes our country has encountered this time, and I am even more convinced of this now. The difficulties faced by the country and the government are still ongoing. In order to solve the various difficulties and reduce the suffering of the people, we must unite and work together. Although the government cannot promise you that prosperity will be restored soon, it will do its best to ensure that the general public can live without fear of lack of food and clothing. All French farmers must work hard to cultivate the land, and all workers should not be confused by the newly formed government. This reform is the result of the war. All my worker friends should know that Bolshevism only makes us poor and oppressed. The situation of the Russian people can serve as a warning. It is expected that socialism will prevail in the new Europe for a while, but this kind of socialism will be able to respect the nationality and wishes of each country. As for France today, not only is it suffering materially, but it is also feeling spiritually depressed because we have always loved freedom. Therefore, our first task in the future should be to strive to restore freedom, which can only be obtained by observing order and discipline. As for the future policy of the new government, what is the significance of my resuming state affairs this time? I hope the people will understand. I have been in politics for a long time and have always believed that the rapprochement between France and Germany is a prerequisite for European peace. This is my belief, deeply rooted, unbreakable, and I want to promote its realization whenever I have the opportunity, so as to establish understanding between the two countries and eliminate the reasons for the repeated wars between the two major nations in history, that is, the lack of understanding between each other. In short, in order to avoid such wars, we need a real French policy, an independent and autonomous policy that is not interfered with by any foreign country, because some countries have always found it beneficial to incite internal strife in our country, so that our country will never have peace."</p>
<p>First Meeting of the New French Cabinet</p>
<p>Vichy, 20th (Havas) – The new cabinet held its first meeting at the Sévigné Villa at 5:30 PM today, chaired by Marshal Pétain himself, who delivered a speech welcoming the head of government, Laval, and the new ministers. Then, Laval, on behalf of the new cabinet, thanked the head of state and assured him that he would be loyal to the head of state and the motherland. General Darlan, Commander-in-Chief of the French Army, Navy, and Air Force, also participated.</p>
<p>Darlan Broadcasts Encouragement to the Three Armed Forces</p>
<p>Vichy, 21st (Havas) – General Darlan, Commander-in-Chief of the French Army, Navy, and Air Force, read an instruction to the troops at the radio station this morning. The full text is as follows: "By order of Marshal Pétain, I have been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Three Armed Forces, which is an unparalleled honor. The relationship between the Commander-in-Chief and the soldiers of the whole country has become closer since this moment. The most important thing in military service is discipline and patriotic enthusiasm. Comrades, the Commander-in-Chief will devote all his energy and time to military affairs from now on. I hope that all officers and soldiers will work with the Commander-in-Chief to obey the leadership of the head of state, follow the path of glory, and defend the motherland and all its territories. Long live the head of state! Long live France!"</p>
<p>Vichy, 20th (Havas) – According to the government announcement, Rear Admiral Bard has been appointed as the Chief of Staff of the French Army, Navy, and Air Force General Headquarters, and Minister Plenipotentiary Chiat has been appointed as the Head of the Secretariat. As for the rumor that the current Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Rochat, will succeed Rear Admiral Bérenger as the ambassador to Argentina, the official has neither confirmed nor denied it.</p>
<h3>The United States Will Issue a Statement to Vichy</h3>
<p>Washington, 21st (Reuters) – Reuters reporters have learned that the United States' statement on Vichy's policy has been drafted since the 18th and is expected to be released today. The statement may reiterate the appeal to the French people in accordance with President Roosevelt's speech to the French people in May last year. President Roosevelt said that cooperation between Vichy and Germany was considered unimaginable. Diplomats believe that Laval's posturing in trying to maintain peaceful relations with the warring country is also possible, because he can use it to deceive the French people. He has done his best in this regard, but with little success, and then he will cooperate with Germany. But this attitude cannot deceive the American people.</p>
<h3>Soviet Forces on the Central Front Launch a Fierce Offensive; 18 Miles from Smolensk; Fierce Battles on the Northern Front</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 20th (Havas) – According to Eastern Front news, fierce battles have taken place near Leningrad and the Finnish front in the past two days. There have also been battles in the Ilmen region near the town of Lykov and near Smolensk. The Red Army claims to have occupied an important stronghold 18 miles from the city of Smolensk. German war reports claim that the surrounded Red Army in the Leningrad war zone has attempted to break through again under the cover of tanks and field artillery, but ultimately failed.</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Haitong News Agency) – A German expert yesterday issued the following supplementary war report to a Haitong News Agency reporter: The Eastern Front continues to thaw, and many sections of the Northern Front are covered with snow and water. In this situation, the German army still took the offensive and continued to make progress.</p>
<h3>Weng Wenhao Inspects Gansu Oil Fields</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 20th (Domei News Agency) – Since the Burma Road was cut off by the Japanese army, the problem of material supply in Chongqing has become increasingly serious.

<h3>Rent Should Still Be Converted to Original Rent Amount After Changing to Collect New Currency; Collecting All New Currency is Equivalent to Increasing Rent in Disguise; Authorities Dispatch Personnel to Thoroughly Investigate to Prevent Circumventing the Prohibition; Some Landlords Have Cancelled Previous Agreements and Still Collect Old Currency</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported yesterday (20th) that major real estate companies in the city have notified their tenants that rent will continue to be collected in legal tender (法幣), and new leases will also specify legal tender as the basis. The tense situation between real estate companies and tenants in recent weeks has eased. Other real estate companies that want to collect Reserve Notes (儲鈔) will continue to collect in this currency, but it must be converted based on the current exchange rate with legal tender. As for tenants who have mistakenly paid rent at the equivalent value of Reserve Notes as legal tender due to misunderstandings, the amount of the market premium will be returned to the tenants and deducted from their April rent, following the mediation measures of the municipal authorities.</p>
<p>Illegal Profiteering, Tenant Resistance</p>
<p>The new dispute between the Dihua Company and its tenants began at the beginning of this month. Because the equal value of legal tender and Reserve Notes was cancelled at the end of March, real estate companies immediately notified tenants that rent must be paid in Reserve Notes, but without any discount based on the exchange rate. The municipal authorities then announced that all taxes and fees must be converted at the exchange rate and paid in Reserve Notes, and landlords were prohibited from increasing rents before the end of March. Landlords used these two factors as reasons to demand the same amount of Reserve Notes when collecting rent, causing a great uproar among tenants, who accused the landlords of this arbitrary action as illegal profiteering, leading to disputes between the two sides.</p>
<p>Dispatch Personnel to Investigate and Prevent Rent Increases</p>
<p>This led to the establishment of a special committee by the municipal authorities to thoroughly investigate the matter. As a result of extensive investigations, it was found that some real estate companies' requests for rent increases were unfounded. It is expected that the authorities will soon continue to implement adjustments to eliminate misunderstandings about the regulations on the use of Reserve Notes and prevent some unscrupulous landlords from outwardly complying with but inwardly violating the prohibition on rent increases.</p>
<p>Eagerly Awaiting Firm Policies from the Authorities</p>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reported that, after inquiring with municipal authorities and the real estate industry, there is still no general and practical solution to the issue of rent collection in legal tender and Reserve Notes in the city. Although the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement and the French Municipal Council's Rent Committee have reportedly been discussing this issue, a solution is not expected until the entire currency issue is clarified. According to sources, the rent situation in the city is currently in a state of flux. Many real estate companies are currently collecting Reserve Notes, while others are planning to switch to collecting Reserve Notes from May 1st, and still others continue to collect legal tender. All parties are currently awaiting the authorities to announce a definite policy on this matter.</p>
<p>Rent Currently Falls into Four Categories</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to a French Municipal Council official's response to reporters, real estate companies generally still accept legal tender for those who have leases specifying rent to be paid in legal tender. However, tenants have been notified that future new rents will be collected in Reserve Notes. Whether or not Reserve Notes can be collected at that time will depend on the currency situation at that time. Real estate companies that collect rent monthly seem to have been divided into four categories: 1) Those who have never demanded to collect Reserve Notes; 2) Those who had made this request and then revoked it; 3) Those who have notified that they will collect Reserve Notes in the near future (mostly starting from May 1st); 4) Those who are already collecting Reserve Notes.</p>
<p>Complex Situation Awaiting Development</p>
<p>Thus, the situation is quite complex, and if there are new developments in the currency situation, this situation may be completely changed. For example, if it is later decided that all rents should be converted at the exchange rate of Reserve Notes to legal tender, then tenants who have already paid in Reserve Notes can reduce their payments in the future according to the exchange rate. A spokesman for the Shanghai Municipal Council stated this morning (21st) that the Council may issue a notice on this matter soon.</p>
<h3>Bank Joint Reserve Association Adjusts Cash Funds, Providing Reasonable Support to Various Banks and Firms, Implemented Starting Yesterday</h3>
<p>As the cash funds in the city have been relatively tight recently, exchanging cash for checks and bills of exchange requires a premium of around 300 yuan per 10,000 yuan. Speculators have also taken advantage of this to make profits. In order to adjust among its members, the Bank Joint Reserve Association has prepared a considerable amount of cash to provide to its members in reasonable amounts. The association will determine the amount to be supplied to each member based on their receipts and payments. Except for the money houses, which will be supplied by the association to the money house reserve, the association will not directly deal with each firm. All banks that have dealings with the association can open a check account or check within this week according to the amount set by the association and exchange cash at the association. This matter was implemented yesterday, and the check premium in the market has been reduced.</p>
<h3>Citizen ID Cards to Be Issued Next Month; Household Survey Nears Completion</h3>
<p>In order to implement the Baojia (保甲) system, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department began surveying households in the International Settlement on February 15th of this year. It is now known that this survey work will be completed by the end of this month. The Police Department will also conduct a thorough review and verification based on the survey results before issuing citizen ID cards. The issuance period is expected to be in mid-May. The citizen ID card will include information such as the specific Bao and Jia (甲) to which the holder belongs, current address, name, age, and occupation. Residents must carry this card with them after receiving it for identification purposes in case of emergency. Therefore, after the issuance of this card, it will be possible to prevent the entry of undesirable elements into the settlement, the prevalence of thieves is expected to be slightly curbed, and the long-awaited system of allocating food according to population will be gradually implemented based on this. As for the French Concession, preparations for the Baojia system will be carried out in parallel with the International Settlement, with mutual cooperation and support in all aspects. The household survey is proceeding smoothly, and citizen ID cards and the system of allocating food according to population are also in the planning stages. Although some deny that the French authorities intend to organize self-defense groups, in the near future, the French Concession will also have similar and sound organizations, or expand and strengthen existing organizations such as neighborhood patrols. In short, the authorities of the two concessions are in complete agreement on the principle of promoting the Baojia system, with only slight differences in implementation methods and progress.</p>

<h3>Shipping Industry Gradually Becoming Active; Merchant Ships Eagerly Seeking to Resume Navigation; Haiyun Changed to Zhoushan to Start Sailing Soon; Gaodeng Renamed Dafeng to Sail to Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>The situation of merchant ships has changed repeatedly since August 13th. Recently, several merchant ships flying the German flag have changed flags, which has been reported in the newspapers many times. The Haifu, a merchant ship of the German firm Lehe &amp; Co., has been purchased by Yamashita Kisen Co. for 1.6 million yuan in legal tender. A new Zhoushan Company has been formed, and the ship's name has also been changed to "Zhoushan". The capital of the company is borne equally by the old and new shareholders of the ship. The route has not yet been determined. It is said that it will sail to Xiamen or Tainan/Taipei. It is also rumored that it will be affiliated with the China Company to sail to Dinghai Shenjiamen, and it is also said that it will sail to Ningbo first. According to the shipping industry, if it joins the Shanghai-Ningbo line, it must entrust the East Asia Shipping Association to act as an agent. It is said that Yamashita Company is coming forward, and it is also in progress. Therefore, it is still uncertain where the ship will sail, and it must be docked to inspect the bottom of the ship, so the opening date is still far away. It is also said that the Moufu was sailing to Wenzhou and was detained by the Japanese Navy in the Zhoushan Islands. It has been more than a year. It is said that a certain celebrity has recently negotiated with the Japanese side, and there is now talk of release. In the future, the nationality will also be changed. The Gaodeng of the German firm Lulin &amp; Co. is also changing its flag and has been renamed "Dafeng", sailing to various ports in northern Jiangsu. All procedures have reportedly been completed and will be sailing within days. The Hana, a ship of the German Far East Shipping Company, has a similar tonnage to the Haifu and is currently under repair. It is also planned to change its flag and participate in the sailing on the eastern Zhejiang line. Various procedures are underway. It is said that the Deping of the Italian firm Zhongyi Company is also considering resuming navigation.</p>

<p>Since the consumption of gasoline has been greatly restricted, public buses and private cars have had to stop. The transportation problem in Shanghai has undergone a major change, and bicycles have emerged as a result. One type here is a new double tricycle. Next to an ordinary bicycle, a rattan basket-like seat is installed, with a leather cushion and thick backrest inside, making it quite comfortable to sit in. Engel and Newburg, engineers from the former Madi Motor Company, are said to be the earliest designers of this type of car. Many of them are already in use on the market, and they plan to manufacture them in large quantities in the future.</p>

<h3>Union Bank Supplies Cash, Check Discount Rate Drops Significantly</h3>
<p>The Bank Union Reserve Committee of this city has decided to supply cash ranging from 1.05 million to ease recent cash shortages by accounting for a member's deposit and withdrawal situation. Member banks can apply for a cash withdrawal through the Union, by submitting a written request or check, and cash holdings will be recorded. Supply to privately owned banks will be handled through the Privately Owned Bank Reserve, but not directly with individual businesses. As a result, yesterday the check discount rate fell sharply from 15 to 7 or 8, eventually between 5 and 10 yuan per 1,000 yuan. The reserve note premium rose to 0.29 and checks were exchanged at 0.3 to 0.32.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Merchants Buy a Large Quantity of Gold, Price Reaches Nearly 20,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of gold on the open market continued to rise, reaching the 20,000 yuan mark. It is said that the price of gold in Tianjin is around 22,000 yuan, and the Tianjin merchants are secretly buying. Moreover, the gold shops continued to buy after buying on the previous day, and the market continued to be good. Cash houses and securities firms also raised prices and bought aggressively. The number of gold bars available after registration and control was extremely small, and the price either did not rise or rose uncontrollably. The market sentiment was very strong. From the morning, the initial price per bar (ten taels) was 200 yuan higher, at 18,350 yuan. Cash houses, gold shops, and securities houses bought in, and the price rose to 18,850 yuan. Another Yuhao sold it, and the price fell slightly at noon to 18,600 yuan. In the afternoon, two gold shops and two securities houses and gold shops raised prices and bought aggressively, and the price suddenly broke through the 19,000 yuan mark. Four bars were traded at 19,300 or 400 yuan. Finally, there were buyers at 19,500 yuan, and the sellers called prices much higher than the purchase price, which was 1,350 yuan higher than the previous day's price. The market atmosphere was strong, with a difference of 1,150 yuan.</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry in gold shops was 50 yuan higher in the morning and 100 yuan higher in the afternoon at Daxin and other shops, at 2,050 yuan (200 yuan reduction for purchases). Tael silver was priced at 18 yuan, and black market price was 13.8-9 yuan. The price of silver coins also rose to 8.6-7 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gold Pound Rises to 10 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market, British and American gold pounds each rose by 20 yuan, the former to 460 yuan, and the latter to 470 yuan. US dollar bills retreated slightly to 32-33 yuan. The rising trend of Hong Kong bills has been curbed, with small bills still at 4.9 yuan and large bills still at 4.8 yuan. Military bills did not fluctuate much, and the final price was 7.25 yuan.</p>
<h3>Government Bond Trading Psychology; Almost Incomprehensible</h3>
<p>The black market for government bonds was increasingly distorted yesterday, almost incomprehensible. All parties were selling, just to get rid of them, and buying just to make a deal, losing their minds for a time. By the time the deal was done, and the price was compared, they were all depressed. For example, Type C was particularly high, rising by almost one yuan, and the closing price was 60 yuan, while Type B was lower than Type C by 0.3 yuan, which was already absurd. Type E was only at 55 yuan, 5 yuan less than Type C, which was also irrational. When the reactive adjustment comes, they will laugh silently. Yesterday, the majority of sellers were Tong Kang and Tong Li, and the amount was extremely large. The rest were Shunli, Yongchang Tongji, Yongkang, etc., but the amount of sales was limited. The majority of buyers were Hu Heji, Yongkang, and Xie Kang. The rest, such as Tongshun, Qianyi, Yuxing, Zhongfu, Lianhe, Hengyu, and Hongxing, were secondary. Other transactions of 350,000 yuan were not counted. The market was not without a surge in sales, and the appetite of buyers was not small. In this way, they competed with each other, and one side would eventually fail, and then there would be a one-sided market. As a result of the market, Type C rose by 0.95 yuan, Type A and Type D only rose by 0.1 yuan, Type E was unchanged, and Type B was still down by 0.3 yuan. The chaotic situation can be seen in the closing price. The total turnover was 1.56 million. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A | 66.00 | 65.20 | 65.40 | Up 0.10</p>
<p>Unified B | 60.00 | 59.00 | 55.70 | Down 0.20</p>
<p>Unified C | 60.00 | 58.50 | 60.00 | Up 0.95</p>
<p>Unified D | 55.50 | 51.00 | 53.10 | Up 0.10</p>
<p>Unified E | 55.70 | 54.60 | 55.00 | Unchanged</p>

<h3>Speculation Concentrated on Shuangma Factory Orders; Market Fluctuations Are Rapid</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market, after rising for many days, is showing signs of calming down. At the same time, some profit-takers are selling, so the market is stable. However, speculators in Shuangma Factory orders are in high spirits, and market fluctuations are rapid. 42 count Blue Phoenix 12,100 to 12,800 yuan, 42 count Yanghe 12,200 yuan, 80 count Nikko 37,200 yuan, 40 count Nikko 11,600 yuan, 40 count Jincheng 11,200 yuan, 42 count Wuzi 11,600 yuan, 42 count Shuiyue 12,350 yuan, 32 count Blue Phoenix 10,900 yuan, 32 count Xiantao 10,850 yuan, 20 count Blue Phoenix 6,600 yuan, 20 count Yueqin 5,800 yuan, 20 count Fengnian 6,040 yuan, 20 count Shuangma 5,6-700 yuan, 20 count Shuang Earth 5,720 yuan, 20 count Tiannv 5,600 yuan, 10 count Red Shuangma 4,300 to 4,450 yuan, 10 count Boy Scout 4,3-400 yuan, 10 count Red Treasure 4,250 to 4,350 yuan, 10 count Weaver Girl 4,450 yuan, 6 count Red Treasure 4,400 yuan, The initial price of 20 count Shuangma factory orders was 4,450 yuan. Due to enthusiastic buyers, the price rose straight to 4,610 yuan. In the middle, profit-takers sold, and the price loosened to 4,520 yuan. After a long period of fluctuation around the 600 yuan mark, the prices suddenly tightened as the closing hour approached, and the market price soared to 4,750 yuan. The closing price was slightly stable at 4,720 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Rise of Eastern Cloth Gains Momentum</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday, influenced by the frenzied surge in eastern cloth, various cloths saw new peaks again. However, the majority was driven by speculative trading and non-industry hoarding. Twelve-pound Fugui Fine Cloth opened at 165 yuan in the morning, later rising to 170 yuan. Spot goods opened at 204.5 yuan in the morning, subsequently rising to 208 yuan. Dapeng Fine Cloth was at 215 yuan, sixteen-pound Earth Thick Cloth at 245 yuan, eight-pound Zhenzhong Thick Cloth at 118 yuan, Peach Blossom Ladies' Cloth at 330 yuan, Light Color at 255 yuan, and Longevity Fu Silk at 6.75 yuan, all with active trading.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Yesterday's spot market saw an astonishing rise due to the frenzied boosting and rampant buying by securities speculators and cotton yarn merchants. It was truly rare. Leading Fine Cloth had broken through the 250 yuan mark, and Four Gentlemen Serge red orders were approaching 8 yuan per yard. The difference compared to actual sales of spot goods was a huge 7-8 jiao per yard, entirely driven by speculation and lacking any proper order. New orders for Leading Fine Cloth opened at 245.5 yuan in the morning, closing at 246 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, it opened at 250 yuan, reaching a high of 254 yuan, and closing at 253.5 yuan in the evening. Four Gentlemen Serge red orders closed at 7.95 yuan in the evening, and bank orders at 7.35 yuan. Spot goods were neglected due to transportation difficulties.</p>

<h3>### Bette Davis Elected Movie Queen</h3>
<p>— New Film</p>
<p>Although the world is shrouded in the clouds of war, everything in Hollywood remains as usual, only with a slightly tenser atmosphere. As in the past year, the rankings of films and actors' performances are evaluated on schedule and announced successively. Due to transportation issues, the news we receive is not as detailed as in previous years. It is particularly worth noting that the female star Bette Davis has been elected as the Movie Queen of 1941, receiving unparalleled honor once again.</p>
<p>There is no need to introduce Bette Davis's artistry here, as everyone knows it. Although she has been acting on screen for quite some time, her acting skills have continuously improved with the times, unlike others whose careers are short-lived. She has won the Academy Award for Best Actress three times in a very short period, which is even rarer, and now she has been elected Movie Queen, truly adding glory to glory. Her receiving accolades and being elected Movie Queen is not accidental. The main reason is that she is diligent and tireless in studying film art day and night, without any arrogance. Even in her life off-screen, she is unlike other female stars, showing no signs of romantic involvement, and is rarely seen in social gatherings, truly deserving the title of "keeping herself pure."</p>
<p>Now, Bette Davis is over thirty years old and has been in the film industry for ten years. Logically, she should be declining, but the opposite is true; she is becoming even more famous. Looking back at the history of Hollywood films, there are not many female stars like her, right? Recently, she hasn't starred in many films, only three or five each year, but every time we see her films, we always find her appearance, her acting skills, everything about her endearing. Especially her seriousness in acting, without any pretense, is probably the main reason she has become a generation of artists.</p>
<h3>A Young Director from Humble Beginnings</h3>
<p>— Yu Yi</p>
<p>Norma Shearer, a pillar of MGM Studios, had a husband named Irving Thalberg, who in his youth was an important film producer, renowned in Hollywood. In middle age, his position became even higher, no less than the soul of MGM, and he had become one of the leading producers in the American film industry. Unfortunately, illness took his life, and the film industry universally mourned, lamenting the rarity of such a talented young man.</p>
<p>A few years later, Hollywood has discovered a rising star, capable and promising, generally regarded as comparable to Irving Thalberg in his youth. This person's surname is Witney, and his given name is William. He is twenty-three years old and already serves as a director at Republic Pictures. His recent work, "King of the Cowboys," is currently showing at the Dahua Theater.</p>
<p>Witney's current position is entirely a reward for his hard work and self-motivation. Two years ago, he was still working as an office boy in the writing room, using the convenience of his position to learn the various skills of the film industry. His background can be said to be extremely humble. At that time, because of his diligent work, he was appreciated by the producer and transferred to the editing room, first as an assistant, then promoted to editor. In his spare time, he diligently studied photography, angles, and lighting techniques. Before long, his artistic achievements were significant, and his knowledge and experience were very rich. Through the producer's recognition and promotion, he was appointed as assistant director, making many new contributions. If he can continue to work hard in the future, there will be even more meaningful works than "King of the Cowboys" to come out, and his future is truly limitless.</p>
<h3>Springtime in the Pear Garden: Recent Developments</h3>
<p>— Master of the Zhenlin Study</p>
<p>Dalin, the younger brother of the famous Dan actor Huang Yulin, is naturally intelligent. He accompanies his brother on the Qin, and is highly regarded in Tianjin. Recently, through the introduction of Wan Zihe, a celebrity in the Beijing opera world, he has been apprenticed to the famous Qin master Xu Lanyuan (who used to accompany Tan Xinpei and Mei Lanfang).</p>
<p>Ma Yunliang's troupe has a stronger drawing power in Beijing than Tan Fuying and Cheng Yanqiu. In the autumn, they will head south to perform. It is widely rumored that they will invite the famous Dan actor Huang Yulin to join them as a collaborator.</p>
<p>Since returning to Shanghai last year, Yan Jupeng has not performed, spending his days in leisure with calligraphy and painting.</p>
<h3>Silver Gate Theater Opens</h3>
<p>The New World Silver Gate Theater was founded by Yu Yuchang, Shi Dekang, Zhao Lianfang, Zhang Gengtang, and others, and is responsible for improving the Siming Wenxi opera, known as the Improved Yongju Opera. It opened on April 19th, inaugurated by the Shanghai celebrity Huang Zenshi, with the scissors-cutting ceremony performed by Ms. Jin Cuiyu and Ms. Jin Cuixiang.</p>

<h3>Riding the Storm Together</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(3) A Guest Arrives</p>
<p>The next day, Xiaowei continued to hear Cuizhen's cries, waking Weicheng. Weicheng was waiting for Fei Changhe's arrival. He had asked Second Mrs. Ye, and there was not much money in the family, fearing that it would not satisfy Fei Changhe's desires. But he thought that Fei Changhe would not really come to ask him for all of Cuizhen's family's food expenses. This day, the clear sun shone on the entire courtyard, and the weather was warming up. The incense burning before First Mrs. Ye's spirit floated out a wisp, lightly and slowly. A magpie came over and asked, "Young Master, there's a lot of mud on your shoes. Would you like to change into a pair of old shoes and take off the shoes on your feet for me to brush?" Weicheng bent down and saw that there was indeed a lot of mud on his white cloth shoes. He asked, "Who told you to ask?" The magpie said, "Miss Cuizhen." Weicheng said, "Let it be. We're in mourning, so there's no point in being too neat."</p>
<p>He walked outside with his hands behind his back. Before he reached the second gate, Axing brought a person in. Axing was in front. Weicheng thought it must be Fei Changhe and hurriedly looked behind Axing. Ah! It was Ms. Chen Guofang, who had made an appointment on the night of the storm to visit around the New Year. Guofang's arrival was within Weicheng's expectations, but they couldn't help but be taken aback when they met. Guofang was wearing a black thick woolen coat, a colorful scarf around her neck, a qipao that reached above her ankles, and a pair of black leather shoes with many holes. Guofang took a step closer and, without saying anything else, just asked, "What's wrong?" Weicheng said, "My mother passed away!" After saying this, he couldn't say anything more. He just reached out and shook hands with Guofang. Guofang said, "My brother is also sick and can't come. Ah, how quickly things change?" Weicheng just shook his head, almost letting his tears fall. Axing said, "Why don't you invite this lady to sit in the reception room?" These words reminded Weicheng. (55)</p>
