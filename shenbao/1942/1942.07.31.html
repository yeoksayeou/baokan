<p>柏林三十日中央社電　德國爲應付聯合國展開第二戰綫之企圖、近已於法國海岸地帶、完成大要塞綫　十九日德軍當局與記者團會見時、記者團之責問、亦特側重於第二戰錢展開之可能性問題、德軍當局宣稱、對於央方之企圖在歐陸作戰、德軍已有萬全之準備、略謂、德軍當局對於英，美伺機於歐洲登陸作戰之企圖、警戒防衛、從未稍怠、英國登歐陸作戰可能性比較大者、爲最靠近英海岸之西歐方面、然於此方面防衛之德軍、已築成堪稱「歐洲沿岸之西壁」之堅强要塞、此種防備、可期萬全、此外具有登陸作戰之危險性者爲挪威、然該地亦已築有同樣堅强之陣壘、今日之英·美兩國、因蘇聯之屢次要求展開第二戰綫、或有不得不於歐洲實行登陸作戰之苦衷、然在德軍之堅强防衛下個不營痴人說夢也、</p>

<h3>赤日當空　冷飲營業興隆　西瓜價貴大家吃不起　棒冰一枝聊解心頭熱</h3>
<p>時值炎夏，赤日當空，近幾日來的天氣，熱得更是厲害，寒暑表上的熱度，每日升到九十度以上，俗語所謂的「熱昏」，這幾天正是熱得發昏章第二了。但是現在正值大伏氣節，大伏裏的熱，這是應當熱的時候；伏天不熱，五殼不結，假使伏天不熱，豈不要釀成荒年了嗎。</p>
<p>在這伏暑季的時候，最勞苦的，是田野間的農夫，阱手胝足，在火傘底下工作。其次要算都市中的黃包車夫，和一般苦力薪工階級的朋友了，終日在烈日底下奔波，汗流夾背，一日不做，一日不活，眞所謂汗血的金錢，養活一家老小，煞費苦心。</p>
<p>伏暑天熱得越厲害，越是歡迎者，唯有做冷飲品生意的商人了。他們恨不得天天熱下去。慢慢的天氣轉凉，所以伏暑時候天氣越是熱得厲害，冷飲品的生意越是特別興隆，價鈿也可以賣得貴一些。今年的夏天，冷飲品的生意，更爲畸形發達。蓋今年的西瓜價格，賣得太貴了，在這生活程度高壓下，一百多元一担西瓜，合之老幣，要二百元外，大家都吃不起西瓜了，去年每担只賣得十五六元，小販切塊零售，每塊五分至一角，今年每塊儲鈔三角，兩相比較，豈不是貴上七八倍嗎！</p>
<p>冷飲品的各類很多，如冰精·冰磚·木偶·貴妃·美女牌棒冰·綠寶鮮橘水·金駝牌鮮橘水·正廣和汽水·冰洪淋·刨冰·酸梅湯·凉粉·吃食店裹的點心冷拌麵·綠豆湯·百合湯等不下數十種。但是少年的冷飲品，何嘗不貴，雖說是一切原料價昂，和水當費一再加價，差不多比去年漲上數倍有奇。去年美女牌棒冰每枝零售一角，今年儲鈔五角，漲起十倍。今年的批價也漲，如「冰精每打新幣五元半，木偶及貴妃每打九元九角，冰磚每打五十五元，門市售價，照批價加一二成的利潤，冰精每枝新幣四角，木偶及貴妃每支一元三角，冰磚每盒六元半至七元，至於綠寶鮮橘水棧單每打十九元至　十元，所以零售價亦須每瓶二元半，金駝牌每瓶一元六角，即正·和的汽水零售每大瓶三元，小瓶一元，至於其他的冷飲品，也貴得可以，吃一碗綠豆湯一元半儲票，這還敢起碼的顧客，假使走進規模較大的冷飲部去吃，非五元十元不夠。當天氣炎熱的時候，冷飲店里坐滿顧客，電風扇開足，一批一批的事如過江之螂，大家都以爲消暑勝地，生意十分與隆，這樣高貴的冷欽，又豈是一般市民所能享受的呢！（未完）</p>
<h3>第二急救時疫醫院　是貧病的救星</h3>
<p>生活程度這樣的高、日圖三餐、夜圖一宿、尚不易解決的時候、如果再要不幸而生病、請醫服藥、動轍數十百金、不要說靠薪水階級的人、難於負担、就是一般的來講、恐怕也無法維持、這是誰都不能否認的事實假使要是窮人生了病、那麽除了靠天聽共自然而外、惟有束手待斃、這是整個的社會問題、</p>

<h3>所望於申請助學金諸生者</h3>
<p>— 默</p>
<p>本報第三屆申請助學諸生，將於日內舉行甄別測騐，同人深信其測騐成績，必能吿慰於捐款諸君，然亦有待於諸生之倍加努力也。</p>
<p>本報助學金之集款，純係各界謬加信託，樂爲捐輸，歷屆捐款數目，雖不能謂爲鉅額，然僅憑各界熱烈同情之一念，得獲此相當之成數，是則各界之仁心義舉，所予社會良好風尙之養成，所予有爲靑年之昭示，其代價決非此表面助學金額所能顯示。「義薄雲天，」捐款諸君，直司當之無愧。</p>
<p>諸生均係優秀學生也，徒以家境淸寒，幾於無力入學，諸生之家長，雖乏資力，然巳督促諸生獲此成績，可吿無罪，而諸生以此優秀成績，申請本報助學金，此諸生之榮譽，亦本報同人所甘爲奔走，以效微勞者也。</p>
<p>諸生此日欣然應試，決非僅爲諸生解決學費問題，諸生之成績，即諸生家長母校之成績，亦即本報助學金之成績。吾人將以諸生之卓越成績，以策勵此後助學金運動之開展，以答謝社會各界之熱忱捐款，諸生勉之。</p>
<p>諸生或將畢業，或尙小學，　仞一簣，百年樹人，是固社會之責，亦同人所應盡力呼籲者。所冀諸生學業旣成之後，無負捐款諸君之厚望，則同人雖溽暑嚴寒，跋涉調查，揮汗呵凍，整理審核，而心神之愉快，亦有足以吿慰社會者矣。</p>
<h3>同學們的責任</h3>
<p>— 田福恒</p>
<p>在放暑假的前一個月，周君便吿訴我，關於他的同學們籌辦暑期補校的計劃。終因無適當地址，未能如願；不過他們繼續努力着。最後學校是放暑假了，他們的時機便跟着來了，分頭工作着，向四方接洽着，猶其是姓睦的一位同學最爲熱心。毫不辭勞苦地在這酷熱的天氣奔走，結果尋着了校址——便是現在的武定路紫陽里培育小學內，定名爲震川夜校暑期補習學校，它雖是臨時性質，但純係爲社會服務；經費雖由各處慨然捐助，多少總是他們奔走的勳續吧！敎師有十六位之多，都是些熱心公益的同學們。這一期共招了一百八十名學生，後雖仍有陸續報名，終因敎室狹小，不得巳祇好謝絕了。班次分小學低·中·高及初中二一年級，報名手續十分簡便，暫納保證金二元。學期終了後憑收據退費。小學一部分書籍免費發給，上課時間規定每日下午四時至七時。主要課程爲國·英·算·理化等，也都依照學生程度而定，所以教時並不感覺困難。</p>
<p>關於這次的成功，眞出人意料外的事，不過幾天的談判，便一切很順利的可以進行了，在本月十五日已正式上課，這不得不感謝培育小學校長汪先生了。這羣爲小朋友造福的同學們，便是現今仍在繼續讀書的高中學生們；他們在校中一向都能勤勤懇懇地求學，爲了鑒於現今各校學費過昂，因而失學的小朋友增加着；所以便不顧一切的艱難地創辦了該補校，它雖容人不多，但收效總不會沒有吧！</p>
<p>爲了生活費用的高漲，學費不得不隨之而漲，較去歲陡增數倍，這自然會使一般學生的家長們，將難再負担這筆巨款，雖各處設有貸金助金的請求，這都是優良學生的門徑，對普通資質的同學是不發生關係的，耍知道像這些不幸的失學者，是更不能忽視的。因爲絕頂天資的，失學了，他們仍可以代自已打主意，不到荒廢，猶其是不幸的摒棄者，他們立在茫茫的大道上，會不知如何措置，如不加以挽救，便會爲環境所征服，最後走入墮落之途。我人雖多造出一個治世的能手，但終不及减少一個社會的廢物來得更好些！我們鑒於這點，便不能不注意晋及敎育，在這牛似專爲富家子弟而設的學府，定難辦到這層，那麼這資任，還是讓我們來負担吧！</p>
<p>要是我們眞地能熱心服務，不妨每天抽出一二小時空暇，組織這一類的義校，來救救這些失學的小朋友們！還希望社會上熱心慈善的仕女們，多多賜以方便，這樣便不致使辦事者失望了。我們如此的舉動，正是吿訴別人·，使別人知道現代學生不全是昏天黑地，專從事於混資格混文憑。另一方面還希望各校當避能盡力將敎室，以最低廉的租金借與辦義校，並請具豐富經騐的敎育家，不時指導我們，這個也是風行一時的小先生制。它的力量，便是以較少的金錢，獲得較大的效果；以大衆的力量，完成大衆的事業。同學們！担負了這責任吧！好讓那些立在校門外徘徊着的同學們，多得一個求學的機會吧！</p>
<h3>丁福保先生與肺癆的奮鬥</h3>
<p>— 吳溪</p>
<p>十年前，因爲我患了肺病，，時時從家伯的口中知道了了福保先生，知道了值年靑時與肺癆奮鬥的經過，所以我腦中時時映着一個患過肺癆的長者，頗欲一識荊州的熱望。戰後，我終於達到了我的願望，但使我怎樣驚奇起來，幾乎叫人決不會相信丁先生是患過肺癆的。他的精神比年靑人還飽滿，又　鑠，於是之後，我從老先生處得到了許多敎訓。許多養生要法，但他的成就不是偶然的，是從苦鬥中肉搏來的，今正老先生六九壽辰，略我所知，以獻讀者。</p>
<p>丁先生幼時，因家境的窮困，叉因先天的貧乏，所以十多歲就患上了肺癆。俄有了這可怕的病，非但沒有好好的醫治，還繼以苦讀。在十六歲的有一天，正孜孜的習字，有一位同窗邑人陳仲行先生在他背後嘆口氣說道：「死在眼前，還練什麼字！」這可知當時一般友人對他的懷疑了。到了卅多歲，依然病弱如故，但並不氣餒，一面把人生觀看得很豁達，所謂一念不生，一塵不現，澄心泯色，絕識凝神，這些都是當時他老先生的座右銘；一面細心的研究衛生學，以身作則，和病菌苦鬥。他的自傳上有云：「余少時多病，注意靜養，凡飲食起居，莫不跋守衛生規則，至二十八歲始日臻康健。」又在一本書上有序曰：「引病日　嚴重，於是振作精神，竭力與病魔反抗，變激烈爲和平，變悲傷爲喜悅，苦悶煩惱，切屏除，無論何事，皆抱樂觀，由是胃納日增，漸能酣睡。一這是他老人家奮鬥的實錄。</p>
<p>現在雖垂垂老矣，但他的精神益健旺，益振作，這都是不屈不撓的勇敢所造成的。現在丁老先生於此大難波濤中，毅然以拯救幼童失學靑年爲己任，以壽儀作助學養幼之用，這是怎樣顯出了先生用意的苦心來。</p>
<p>請求助學的靑年們，當不乏病弱之輩，望能以丁先生處世之法爲參考，並不使身體與苦學相背道也。（酬移丁先生壽儀）</p>
<h3>致貸學同學書</h3>
<p>親愛的朋友：</p>
<p>我知道你近來在家裹埋着頭努力地在預備着考試的功課，我也跟你一樣，當殘酷的熱浪迫逼着人們的時候，幾度傾翻過我的書本　但一想到報館裏幾位爲我們而忙着的先生也在陪着我們忍受熱浪的攻擊時，心底裏不由得陡的翻起了一陣慚愧的自譴，於是我們又振起精神來苦讀了。朋友，你覺得苦嗎？不，決不！我敢保證在我們的一羣裏，斷沒有一個喊苦的人存在。我們不苦，我們祇覺得自己是幸福的，是有希望的，雖然窮了些，但是窮不是病，正由於窮的恩賜，才造成了我們現在一塊可以供雕琢的璞玉。你看，我們的畢分，不都是冠在一級之前嗎？我們的操行，不都是在乙等以上嗎？我們沒有虛榮奢侈的惡習，我們肯的是用功，甘的是吃苦，會的是勞動，這都是從那裹來的呢？朋友，我知道你會毫不猶豫地回答我這樣說：是窮啊！呵，親愛的朋友，我們旣然明白了，就得要樂窮，不獨目前這樣，而且永遠要這樣，窮會使你做一個完人，你看，世界各國的偉人，不都是從艱難窮困中奮鬥成功的嗎？</p>
<p>我們不怨尤父母沒給我們預備一個優美富裕的家庭，而讓我們來享受養尊處優的生活，不但這樣，當父母在爲着我們的衣食而在流汗的時候，我們的熱淚也不禁奪眶而出，我們祇恨父母爲什麼要把我們生得這樣晚，不然，至少也可以給他們些許的精神和物質的安慰，我們的年齡和學識實在太小了啊！</p>
<p>同學中有人以爲我們貸學是可恥的，這也難怪他們，因爲在他們的目光裏，一百幾十塊錢是不算得什麼一回事的，至多也不過是他們一二個星期裹的零用費，而我們一般窮同學混在他們一所學校裏，難怪他們要引爲可恥了，但回頭看一看他們的成績那才可恥哩。</p>
<p>現在再來談社會罷。多數人說這社會是自私的，是冷酷的，但在我們說來，那不過是一種片面的斷言罷了。貸學金就是一架社會的顯微鏡，朋友！請你也來細騐一下，在裏面，你會看見有人在大伏天裏流着汗在替人辦理呼籲，徵信，考試等煩重而精確的工作。更有人把他們自已的血汗去換來的錢來賜給我們，讓我們只要憑着自己的學問去享受。這社會是自私的麼，是冷酷的麼？朋友，當你看到這裏，我保證你會狂呼起來說：「呵，社會，你太偉大，你給了我更多的勇氣！」那時候，我父耍請你按捺下去，就是請你再想一想他們爲什麼要這樣做，是不是因爲有了一偭你，有了一個我？假使果眞是這樣想，那末社會錯了，而你我更錯了！朋友，吿訴你，他們不是爲了你，也不是爲了我，他們却是爲了敎育，他們要把我們造成一個有用的人才！</p>
<p>最後請你別忘了當你的老師在爲你蓋章塡分時的諄勉和希望，他們是多末地愛着我們這羣，臨走時還叫我們努力尋疑題來問，啊可愛的老師，可敬的辦理貸金的各位執事先生和社會的熱心人士，目前我們不能拿什麼來答謝你，這裏所有的，是我們一羣人赤誠的敬禮！朋友，你說我們應當這樣說麼，完了，不多天我們就能在試塲裏會面了。</p>
<p>敬祝你榜上有名</p>

<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（七）迅雷</p>
<p>維城道：「這未嘗不是一個辦法，這些人又是誰？」葉二太太道，一那抽鴉片烟的人，不知道是誰。那抽烟捲的人年紀還輕，他就是程炳。」維城把拳頭握得緊緊的，把牙齒咬得緊緊的，說道：「他就是程炳，他在那裏，他在船上嗎？」葉二太太道：「我說的是過去的事，維城，你把心靜一靜，不要聽我說了，你就生氣，那是不對的。」維城道：「程炳當時怎麼樣？」葉二太太道：「當時你媽沒辦法，坐下來了，就吿訴他們住在什麼地方，姓什麼，和那幾個人出來的。程炳和又一個人，在那時眞有些熱腸古道，在船艙裏找出一根小竹竿，臨時套上一塊布，那布上寫了：港北鄕厲小姐在此，希望厲姓家人來詢問。詞句是不是這樣，不過意思總是這樣。這面小旗，讓船夥計擎在手裏，給岸上擁來擠去的人看，大約有一兩個鐘頭，始終沒有人間。那程炳就說，厲小姐你放心，我們雖然是萍水相逢，你不認識我，我不認識你，可是忽然的和家裹人失散，忽然的會下到我們船裏，這也是佛家說的因緣。我預算起來，再過幾十分鐘，大會就會在岸上排列了，給我們看。我們看過賽會，到那個時候，你們家人還找不到你，你還我不到家人，那把我們的船，送你回港北鄉厲家宅去，這總是千妥萬妥的了。你媽很感激程炳，說：程先生，你是那裏人，這位老先生是誰。程炳沒有肯說，只說：你一些也用不着驚慌，一個人的善惡，是可以一望而知的，你看我們是善人還是惡人。說過這話，會就來了，這兩偭人和你媽，都站在船頭上看會。你媽那裏還有什麼心緒看會，她是在看路上的人。這會，就看了兩小時，竟是沒有你的舅舅，也沒有同村的兄弟姊妹，天倒是黑上來了。」（一四二）</p>

<p>Lisbon, 30th (Alliance News Agency dispatch) – According to a Reuters dispatch from London, it is admitted that after yesterday's fierce fighting, General Timoshenko's forces in the Caucasus are in grave danger. The German army's combat capabilities are deemed superior to those of the Red Army in all aspects. General von Bock has deployed his vanguard infantry in the Tsimlyanskaya area over the past 24 hours. Simultaneously, the railway from Stalingrad to Krasnodar has been cut in several places by the German air force and its advancing infantry.</p>
<p>Bear City, 30th (Regional Alliance News Agency dispatch) – German forces that have penetrated the Northern Caucasus have reached the Stalingrad-Krasnodar railway south of the Don River. General von Bock is leading his forces to press closer to Stalingrad, reportedly reaching the Krasnaya area at the far eastern end of the Don Bend. This is consistent with German announcements that Soviet forces' retreat route eastward within the Don Bend has been cut off, and that fighting in this area has been particularly fierce in recent days. The battle in the Don Bend has been ongoing for five days, with German forces, especially tank units, penetrating deeply into Soviet lines. Soviet sources claim that the German vanguard, which has crossed the Don River, comprises 10,000 tanks and thousands of German bombers, launching a full-scale offensive. German tanks are reportedly crossing the Don River around Tsimlyanskaya to reinforce the German vanguard (on the Stalingrad-Krasnodar railway line), which has reportedly occupied Proletarskaya. This move is a wedge-shaped penetration into the heartland of the Northern Caucasus, posing a greater threat to Soviet forces attempting to stem the German advance.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 30th (Havas dispatch) – Fierce fighting is currently taking place on the southern front from the Isk district (southwest of Rostov) to the eastern bank of the Don River. Red Army resistance appears extremely fierce. According to the latest reports, the Stalingrad-Krasnodar railway has been bombed by enemy aircraft, disrupting traffic. General von Bock's vanguard has reached the city of Pololer-Tanskaya, which is in the Tsimlyansk area. Although the Germans have seized key points, the German advance has been blocked by the Red Army, and German casualties are heavy, no less than 1,500 men. According to Berlin sources, German forces were still engaged in mopping-up operations yesterday between Bataisk and the Sea of Azov, but the focus of the eastern front is still on the southern route. The German High Command's main effort is currently concentrated on the southern bank of the Don. According to Red Army reports, fierce fighting is taking place in the Krasnaya area, with German tanks attempting to cross the river, but they have not succeeded. This news may add a new factor to the German plan to attack the Volga River. As of today, Stalingrad seems most threatened from the west and southwest, but the German attempt to cross the river in that area, and General von Bock's desire to break through the Red Army's defenses north of Stalingrad, so as to bring the city under a German pincer strategy, can be clearly seen here. According to German sources yesterday, General Timoshenko has transferred his reserve troops to the area around Stalingrad for combat. The Soviet side also claims that the Red Army's positions on the right bank of the Don River remain unshaken. As for the German air force, it is quite active over the front lines, constantly bombing Soviet railways, especially emphasizing the Astrakhan-Saratov railway, because this railway is the only British supply line in central Russia.</p>
<h3>Voroshilov Appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Front; Major Battle Expected on the Kuban Plain; Soviet Forces in Northern Caucasus Mobilized</h3>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet border, 29th (Havas dispatch) – Today is the 403rd day of the German-Soviet war. The front line battles are generally as follows: (1) German forces in the Don region have clearly reached their key objectives and have cut the Red Army on the southern front into two sections. The German vanguard in the Selyansky District is only ten miles away from the Krasnodar-Stalingrad railway line. All traffic on this line has been blocked by German air force bombing. Traffic on the Kelmuk Plain behind the railway line is almost cut off. The northern and southern sections of the Red Army on the southern front can only communicate via the Caspian Sea. According to Italian sources, General Voroshilov has been appointed commander-in-chief of the southern front, and General Timoshenko remains in command of the forward positions in the Don River delta. (2) Two German forces in the Rostov area are advancing on the Kuban area and the Caucasus. The first force, after occupying Rostov and Bataysk, has reached Kagarlik near the Sea of Azov. The second force crossed the Don River east of Rostov, turned northeast, crossed the Sal and Manysh Rivers, and is now advancing towards the Rostov and Elista railway hub. It is widely believed that a major battle will unfold on the Kuban Plain. The German forces will not advance southeast, because the Kelmuk Plain is a swampy area, unsuitable for motorized units. (3) The situation on the Don River delta and Stalingrad fronts is increasingly unfavorable to the Red Army. Red Army units are now fighting fiercely in the Kalach District. Although reinforcements and heavy tanks have arrived to support them, German forces are advancing along the north and south sides of Kalach, which may result in the encirclement of Stalingrad. It is rumored that the city is already within range of German heavy artillery fire. (4) Voronezh remains a weak point in the German defense line. The German side claims that Red tanks continue to attack the area, but not as fiercely as before. The Soviet side claims that the Red Army has broken through the German lines in two places south of Voronezh. (5) According to Italian sources, a portion of the Soviet light fleet, mainly gunboats, managed to slip away from Rostov in time, via the Don River, to the Volga Canal. They were able to take refuge in the Volga River. It is also learned that some Red Army units attempted to pass through the Korch area, but after a landing attempt, they were repulsed by German artillery.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Ukrainian border, 29th (Havas dispatch) – German forces, who started attacking Stalingrad on the 23rd of this month, continued to advance today and gained another foothold on the Don River in the Tyssaryno area, 40 miles northwest of Stalingrad. Another large German force continued to advance eastward. Last night, they reached the railway line from Moscow to Stalingrad. The German strategy of encircling Stalingrad is rapidly progressing. According to German sources, German forces are advancing towards the city of Dubovka on the Volga River. Generally, the German High Command will order a frontal attack on Stalingrad after the German forces have invaded the Volga River basin. Judging from the current situation, the section of the Don River basin from Voronezh to Rostov is completely in German hands. The Red Army's defense of the two sections of the Don River totals only 40 miles. In the Donets River basin, although the Red Army has reached the river, it has failed to cross it, and the German forces are attacking in two directions, threatening to encircle the Red Army. Further south, German forces on the lower Don River are still engaged in mopping-up operations, reaching the city of Kruglyak yesterday. Military observers are deeply surprised by the Red Army's failure to resist resolutely in the Don River basin. However, some people believe that the Red Army High Command has made a systematic retreat, maintaining the strength of its forces, so that it can establish a new defense line near the Caucasus and continue to resist. This view has become increasingly powerful in recent days.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 30th (Reuters dispatch) – A Moscow United Press dispatch reports that Soviet forces in the Northern Caucasus are fighting desperately for their survival. Their situation is becoming increasingly difficult after railways and highways have been destroyed by German aircraft. In addition, German ground and air forces are constantly attacking Soviet positions.</p>
<h3>German-Soviet War Reports</h3>
<p>Führer Headquarters, 30th (Reuters dispatch) – Today's German military report stated that German forces south of Rostov are fighting fiercely with the enemy's rearguard. German mechanized units south of the Sal River occupied the city of Proletarskaya. The important railway connecting the Caucasus with other Soviet cities has been cut off. Yesterday, German Württemberg and Baden army mechanized units destroyed 68 enemy tanks. After completing reconnaissance work, our fighter squadrons assisted the army in attacking the enemy. In the Voronezh area, the enemy lost 18 tanks yesterday. The enemy also suffered setbacks in the central sector and south of Lake Ilmen.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 29th (Havas dispatch) – The Red Army High Command broadcasted a war report from Moscow radio stating, "Today our forces fought bravely in the Voronezh, Selyanskaya, Bataysk, and Krasnaya areas. There have been no major changes in other war zones."</p>
<p>Moscow, 30th (Havas dispatch) – This morning, the local wireless radio announced that fierce fighting had taken place in the Voronezh area in the past 24 hours. The German forces launched fierce attacks but failed. They attacked again in the evening, while Hungarian infantry also attacked in a certain section of the riverbank. A Hungarian battalion was annihilated.</p>
<p>Rostov in Ruins</p>
<p>Stockholm, 29th (Havas dispatch) – After the Red Army abandoned the key southern Soviet fortress of Rostov, German authorities allowed foreign visitors to inspect the site yesterday. Only 15 houses remained in the city, and the desolate scene was even worse than Sevastopol after the battle. However, about half of the city's 520,000 residents remained in place, while the rest had mostly retreated with the army or had gone missing. The whole city was in ruins, and it was almost impossible to reach the banks of the Don River, as the roads were piled high with broken cars, guns, artillery, tanks, and ordnance, which the Red Army had no time to take away during the retreat.</p>
<h3>Soviet Government Formulates Three Types of Medals</h3>

<h3>Britain and the United States Announce Merchant Ship Losses; No Agreement Reached</h3>
<p>London, 29th (Havas dispatch) – Deputy Prime Minister Major Attlee announced in the House of Commons today that, to date, the Allied countries have not reached any agreement on the announcement of merchant ship losses. It is difficult to say at this time whether Britain and the United States are prepared to issue a joint statement on this matter. Generally speaking, British ships and sailors receive complete protection to avoid being attacked. At this point, Labor MPs and Wilmot stood up and spoke, stating that a large convoy of merchant ships was said to be sailing to a certain important location, but due to insufficient protection from the Admiralty, many merchant ships were lost as a result.</p>
<p>Washington, 29th (Havas dispatch) – The Navy Department has just announced that on the 24th of this month, a small American cargo ship was sunk by a submarine using a torpedo 150 miles off the Atlantic coast of the United States. Several rescued sailors have landed at an eastern port.</p>
<h3>Indian Viceroy Calls Administrative Council to Discuss Two Proposals on the Indian Issue</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 29th (Reuters dispatch) – According to a Reuters dispatch from New Delhi, the Indian Viceroy's Administrative Council convened here on the morning of the 29th. The content has not been officially released, but well-informed sources here believe that the content of the discussion includes: (1) the US-British proposal on the issue of Indian independence after the war; (2) the proposal to convene a round table conference immediately to resolve the opposing views of various factions in India. However, the Viceroy's Administrative Council will issue a general statement on the Indian issue before the National Congress Party's conference to be held in Mumbai on August 7, in order to disintegrate the anti-British forces. However, it is doubtful how the anti-British forces, which have spread like wildfire throughout India, can be disintegrated.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 30th (Reuters dispatch) – A British press release states that the Royal Conference was held in New Delhi yesterday to discuss the possibility of the Allied countries guaranteeing Indian independence after the war, and to debate the method of convening a round table conference to discuss resolving the Indian issue before the end of the war.</p>
<h3>British Position on India Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 30th (Alliance News Agency dispatch) – According to London sources, British Secretary of State for India Amery recently stated that Britain's position on India has not changed since Sir Cripps put forward his proposals regarding the future constitution. If Indian leaders insist on their "quit India" attitude, the British authorities will take "all possible steps" to deal with it. Amery's warning was issued today when a Member of Parliament in the House of Commons asked about the impending launch of a disobedience movement by the Standing Committee of the Indian National Congress. Labor MP Ammon asked about the British government's intentions regarding the current Indian issue. Amery replied that if concessions were made to Indian leaders, the vast and complex machinery of the Indian government would be completely disrupted. Ammon also asked whether it would not be better for the British government to openly seek compromise with India, without losing face, instead of issuing threats. Amery replied, "We have exhausted our power to do so." This statement indicates that the British government resolutely refuses to acknowledge India's viewpoint.</p>

<h3>British House of Commons Discusses Installing Air Conditioning in Tanks</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 30th (Reuters dispatch) – A London dispatch reports that it is widely rumored in Britain that German tanks operating in Africa are equipped with climate control equipment. Therefore, this matter was raised for study at yesterday's meeting of the House of Commons. Minister of Production Lyttelton stated that there are difficulties in terms of weight and space in installing air conditioning equipment in tanks, but he has still entrusted experts to study whether air conditioning equipment can be installed in these vehicles.</p>

<h3>From the Eastern Front to Western Europe: German Shock Troops Arrive in Paris; Anglo-American Opening of a Second Front Questioned; Rumors of a Decision in London</h3>
<p>Paris, 30th (Haitong News Agency) – German shock troops transferred from the Eastern Front to Western Europe, commanded by General Lundstedt, to strengthen defenses, arrived in Paris yesterday. As these troops moved from the eastern to the western part of the city, crowds gathered along the streets to watch. General Lundstedt and the commander of the shock troops, Dietrich, conducted a review lasting four hours. The column of troops stretched for one hundred kilometers, and the magnificent military display was praised by all observers. The German military equipment included light armored vehicles, heavy tanks, motorized heavy artillery, anti-aircraft guns, and flat-trajectory guns, all of the latest models. Parisian newspapers reported that with the German reinforcement of Western Europe, any British attempt to invade the continent would be disastrous.</p>
<p>Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) – To counter the Allied attempt to open a second front, Germany has recently completed a major fortified line along the French coast. During a meeting between German military authorities and a group of journalists on the 19th, the journalists' questions focused particularly on the possibility of a second front being opened. The German military authorities declared that they were fully prepared for any Allied attempt to fight on the continent. They stated that the German military authorities had never relaxed their vigilance and defense against British and American attempts to land in Europe. The most likely place for a British landing was Western Europe, closest to the British coast. However, the German forces defending this area had constructed a strong fortress that could be called the "Western Wall of the European Coast," providing comprehensive defense. Furthermore, Norway was also considered a potential landing site, and similar strong fortifications had been built there. Today, Britain and the United States might feel compelled to launch a landing operation in Europe due to repeated demands from the Soviet Union for a second front. However, under the strong German defenses, such efforts were futile.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 30th (Haitong News Agency) – New York radio broadcast a dispatch from London carried by the New York Times, stating that the negotiations in London regarding the opening of a second front had concluded, and a decision was said to have been reached. However, the timing and location of the second front's opening were unknown. Only a few people were privy to the details.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 30th (Haitong News Agency) – A London dispatch last night reported that people in Britain were still actively discussing whether or not to open a second front. Downing Street held a meeting to discuss the matter, but London newspapers and foreign journalists were unable to ascertain the intentions and strategies of the British government. Due to a lack of reliable information, rumors were rampant in London. Left-wing figures continued to advocate for the early opening of a second front. However, London newspapers stated that launching a landing in Europe would inevitably lead to serious dangers. The Daily Herald, the organ of the Labour Party, which usually supported a second front, also said that attacking the European continent was extremely dangerous with very little hope of success. Only The Times and the News Chronicle still advocated for the immediate opening of a second front. Roosevelt's recent meeting with military advisors in Washington had attracted considerable attention in Britain. It was widely believed that the second front issue must have been discussed.</p>
<p>Washington, 29th (Havas News Agency) – Talk of opening a second front has simultaneously cooled down in both Britain and the United States. According to sources in charge, this plan has either been abandoned or indefinitely postponed. The reasons are nothing more than the following: (1) a shortage of merchant ships, insufficient to transport and maintain the normal supplies of millions of expeditionary troops; (2) it is reported that the German army has built defensive fortifications along the coast of France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. Military experts say that these fortifications are similar to the Maginot Line. If the Allied forces want to pass through this line, they must emulate the German strategy of bombing the port of Sevastopol in the Soviet Union, launching an organized aerial bombardment. However, the Allied forces do not seem to have a strong enough air force to carry out this arduous task. This is also a fact. Britain and the United States recently held a meeting in London, with the focus of the discussions being the possibility of opening a second front. Labour Minister Bevin was the only member of the British cabinet to openly advocate for this, but his motives were simply those of a self-important meddler provoking the enemy to cause trouble. As for Washington, government officials have remained silent on the matter. Furthermore, it is reported that Soviet newspapers themselves have abandoned the demand for a second front and are instead demanding that the Allies supply the Soviet Union with more military equipment.</p>
<h3>Goebbels Publishes Essay</h3>
<p>Berlin, 30th (Haitong News Agency) – German Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels published an essay in a German-Italian magazine, stating that attempting to invade Asia would be a "mad act." Discussing the possibility of opening a second front, he said that if Britain wanted to attack the European continent, he would express a "sincere welcome" and hoped that the United States would also send troops to participate in this war. The United States would engage with the German army for the first time. Although German soldiers do not carry tennis rackets or golf clubs, they do carry excellent weapons and have gained combat experience on various European battlefields. They are happy to take this opportunity to make it clear to the American army that the American army is also forbidden from entering Europe. Goebbels pointed out that, according to Soviet sources, German troops froze to death 3,000,000 people from December of last year to March of this year. And now they are encountering the German army's fresh forces. The enemy dreamed of opening a second front while the German army was trapped on the Eastern Front, forcing the German command to mobilize troops stationed in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, and other countries to rescue the Eastern Front. But in reality, these dreams have all come to nothing. The German forces in Western Europe have not been mobilized, and the most elite troops have been transferred to the Western area. Goebbels continued to describe Churchill's difficult situation, stating that there was absolutely no way to maintain his prestige. If he did not open a second front and the Soviet Union continued to collapse, political turmoil would occur in the country, and relations between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union would deteriorate. If he attacked the European continent, he would likely suffer a disastrous defeat, which would affect the entire war situation. For Britain and the United States to attack the European continent would be a mad act, with serious consequences for Britain and the United States. Germany welcomes Churchill and Roosevelt's attempts, as they have an adventurous character. The German command has prepared to deal with this adventure. The Allies have probably realized that they will be defeated on the Eastern Front and have no choice but to risk attacking the European continent. Germany and the people of the world will one day understand the truth about the propaganda regarding the attack on the European continent. Germany is prepared. If British and American troops attack the European continent, they will be completely annihilated. The German people will surely witness the day when British troops enter Berlin, but these British troops will not be conquerors but prisoners. The remnants of the British army will once again cross the English Channel from Dunkirk and retreat to Tipperary (Ireland).</p>
<h3>Soviet Military Delegation Flies Away from Cairo</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 30th (Haitong News Agency) – Most of the Soviet military delegation left Cairo by plane on the 28th, leaving only a few officers in the Egyptian capital as liaison officers for the British Near East Command. The outcome of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations is unknown.</p>
<h3>United States Begins Nationwide Scrap Metal Collection</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 29th (Allied News Agency) – According to a Washington dispatch, Roosevelt hosted a group of journalists here at noon on the 29th, urging the nation to assist in the scrap metal collection campaign. It is said that the raw materials problem is serious in some respects. This shows one aspect of the United States' wartime material shortages.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 30th (Haitong News Agency) – President Roosevelt has announced a nationwide scrap metal collection campaign. The governor of Connecticut announced yesterday that the state would begin collecting on August 3rd, with each household expected to contribute 25 kilograms of scrap metal on the first day.</p>
<h3>War in the Egyptian Desert Zone Turns Quiet Again; Axis Aircraft Attack Cairo Yesterday</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 30th (Allied News Agency) – General Rommel's Axis forces and General Auchinleck's Eighth Army each held their ground yesterday, and the land war on the Egyptian front entered a state of rest again. Apart from some activity by both sides in the southern part of the front, the air was also quiet. The result of this fierce battle was that a small area in the northern part of the Al-Alamain front returned to Axis hands, and the Italian army captured the Siwa Oasis. General Auchinleck's fierce offensive was used to set up landmines in areas well-defended by the German forces, in order to prevent the British air force’s efforts to concentrate its bombing of the main German transportation lines between Tobruk and Sidi Barrani. Although the attacks were somewhat successful, they failed to cut off the movement of German manpower and materials. On the North African coast, the British army also launched a fierce air raid on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 30th (Allied News Agency) – According to a Cairo dispatch, the British Middle East Command announced that Cairo was attacked by Axis aircraft early this morning, causing slight material damage. Air raid alerts were also issued in the Suez Canal Zone and several provinces in upper and lower Egypt.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Egyptian border, 29th (Havas News Agency) – After fierce fighting on the Egyptian front from the 25th to the 27th, both sides have been limited to reconnaissance activities in the past two days. The British army once launched a fierce attack on German positions in the south, but was forced to retreat to its original positions and continued to fight in the area of the El-Alamein Heights for 24 hours. British Commander-in-Chief General Auchinleck does not seem willing to launch a large-scale offensive, but only wants to find weaknesses in the Axis defense line. Apart from this, another goal of the British offensive is to contain the Axis forces so that General Rommel cannot consolidate his positions, that is, he cannot prepare to launch another fierce attack on British positions. However, no armored units participated in the British offensive. At the beginning of the war, the British army clearly had the upper hand, but by the morning of the 27th, the German army began to counterattack. The British artillery then opened fire, covering the infantry's retreat to its original positions. Both sides' air forces participated in the battle. By night, the artillery fire stopped, and the desert area was able to return to a state of calm. This is also acknowledged by the British military, as the result of this offensive did not achieve General Auchinleck's expectations. However, due to the recent arrival of a large number of military equipment, especially giant American tanks, the British side is still very optimistic about the future of the war.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 29th (Allied News Agency) – According to a Cairo dispatch, the Suez Canal was bombed again by the Axis air force and was heavily damaged.</p>
<h3>German Aircraft Raid England Under Bright Moonlight</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 30th (Allied News Agency) – According to a London dispatch, the German air force launched its first raid of the week on London and the Midlands this morning, dropping bombs under the bright moonlight. Some German aircraft flew to a city in the western Midlands, dropping incendiary bombs and causing violent explosions. There was also some German aircraft activity in East Anglia and the Northwest. The British Air Ministry announced that German aircraft were active in the Midlands and eastern counties of England, and the Birmingham area suffered slight damage, with a few dozen casualties.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council to Form Economic Police Force to Supervise All Economic Activities to Improve Various Price Controls</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that Japanese sources claimed yesterday (29th) that the Shanghai Municipal Council is studying a plan to organize a special economic police force to supervise all economic activities within the International Settlement. After the implementation of various economic control measures in various parts of the city, the need for such an economic police force has been deeply felt. The technical knowledge of the ordinary police force is insufficient to effectively supervise economic activities in accordance with the various regulations. If the plan to establish an economic police force in the International Settlement is realized, this group will be under the jurisdiction of the Police Department and will be a supporting part of the Police Department. Economic experts will be invited to control commodity prices, financial transactions, food distribution, and other similar measures. It is heard that police forces outside the International Settlement are also studying the possibility of establishing their own economic sub-units, as supervising economic activities is a heavy burden for regular police forces. According to well-informed sources, if the economic sub-unit of the Police Department is established, price controls will be greatly improved and the black market will be cracked down on. Special police officers can investigate store prices at any time.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Scorching Heat in this City Exceeded 100 Degrees</h3>
<p>Yesterday, this city was scorched by the sun all day long, and the entire city was like being in a furnace. According to the Observatory records, the highest temperature yesterday rose to 100.2 degrees (37.9 degrees Celsius), and the wind was calm, so the heat was even more unbearable. Whether working in the scorching sun or sitting indoors, people were sweating profusely. The highest temperature in Shanghai's summer was in 1934, when the temperature rose to 104 degrees. That year, there was a severe drought for more than 100 days, causing great damage to crops in the suburbs. The next year, 1935, the highest temperature also rose to 100.8 degrees. Since then, the highest temperature each year has not exceeded 100 degrees. This city has been sunny for half a month, and the heat has been extremely unusual every day, without any showers. Crops in the suburbs are in great need of water, and drawing water for irrigation is extremely laborious. In places where water supply is inconvenient, the rice and wheat have withered, and farmers wear worried expressions.</p>
<h3>Anonymous Extortion to be Severely Punished</h3>
<p>The head of the Special Higher Criminal Division of the Police Department issued a statement, saying that recently, there have been reports in the alleyways of the International Settlement that Chinese detectives and fake detectives of the Police Department have used the names of Japanese police officers and cadres to extort money from citizens under the pretext that they are suspected of committing crimes, or illegally detain them. It is known that the above situations are not true. If these situations are found to be true, the authorities will express their regret. In any case, the police authorities will severely deal with these unscrupulous elements. If any citizen suffers losses or learns of crimes of this nature, they should immediately report the details to the nearest police station for handling.</p>

<h3>Notice from the Japanese Military Authority in This City - Citizens Must Obey Air Defense Regulations</h3>
<p>From the Allied News Agency: In view of the importance of air defense in this city, the highest Japanese army and naval authorities in this city have adopted comprehensive air defense measures. The highest commander of the army and navy has issued a notice, and the army and navy garrison authorities have issued a statement, hoping that the general public will strictly abide by air defense regulations. The notice states: All citizens residing in Shanghai must fulfill the obligations to abide by all regulations related to civilian air defense stipulated by the relevant authorities. July 29, 1942. The highest commander of the army, the highest commander of the navy, and the army and navy garrison authorities issued a statement saying: Regarding air defense measures in Shanghai, in view of the importance of this city, the Japanese military authorities have taken comprehensive measures, and elite aviation units of the Japanese army have preemptively attacked enemy air bases and destroyed their air power. Therefore, to date, Shanghai has no danger of air raids, and citizens can live and work in peace. This is cause for great celebration. However, as the Greater East Asia War develops into a world war, considering the mobility of aircraft, it cannot be said that Shanghai is absolutely not a target for aerial guerrilla warfare. Therefore, regarding civilian air defense, we should always take a "prepared for the worst" approach and adopt foolproof countermeasures. Therefore, the highest commander of the army and navy has issued a notice to the citizens of Shanghai, imposing on them the obligation to strictly abide by all regulations related to civilian air defense stipulated by the relevant authorities. The Shanghai Garrison and the Shanghai Naval Special Landing Force, the former being the Shanghai Army Air Defense Headquarters and the latter being the Shanghai Navy Air Defense Headquarters, guide the municipal government, the Public Works Department, and the Japanese Consulate Police on civilian air defense matters. The municipal government, the Public Works Department, and the Japanese Consulate Police guide the general public in implementing air defense measures. It is hoped that all Shanghai citizens will strictly abide by the air defense regulations and instructions of the authorities in the future.</p>

<h3>Red Sun Overhead - Cold Drink Business Flourishing - Watermelons Too Expensive, People Can't Afford Them - Popsicles Offer a Momentary Relief from the Heat</h3>
<p>It's the height of summer, with the red sun blazing overhead. The weather these past few days has been particularly scorching, with the temperature rising above 90 degrees Fahrenheit every day. As the saying goes, "heatstroke," and these days are indeed heatstroke-inducing. But it's the height of the hottest period of the year, and this is the time for heat. If it's not hot during this period, the crops won't ripen. If it weren't hot now, wouldn't that lead to famine?</p>
<p>During this scorching summer season, the most hardworking people are the farmers in the fields, toiling under the blazing sun. Next are the rickshaw pullers and the general working class in the city. They spend their days running under the scorching sun, sweating profusely. If they don't work for a day, they don't eat. Their money is earned with blood and sweat, enough to feed their families, which takes painstaking effort.</p>
<p>The hotter the weather during this period, the more welcome it is to cold drink merchants. They wish it would stay hot every day. Gradually the weather will turn cooler, so the hotter it is during the summer, the more prosperous the cold drink business becomes, and the prices can be sold higher. This summer, the cold drink business is particularly abnormally developed. This is because the price of watermelons is too high. Under this high-pressure living standard, watermelons cost over 100 yuan per load, which is equivalent to over 200 yuan in old currency. Everyone can't afford watermelons. Last year, each load sold for only 15 or 16 yuan, and vendors sold slices for 5 to 10 cents each. This year, each slice costs 3 jiao in reserve certificates. Compared, isn't that 7 or 8 times more expensive?</p>
<p>There are many types of cold drinks, such as ice essence, ice bricks, wooden dolls, imperial concubines, beauty brand popsicles, green treasure fresh orange juice, golden camel brand fresh orange juice, Zheng Guanghe soda, ice cream, shaved ice, sour plum soup, cool jelly, cold noodles from food stores, mung bean soup, lily soup, and dozens of others. But young people's cold drinks are also expensive. Although it is said that the price of all raw materials is high, and water and electricity costs have repeatedly increased, they are almost several times more expensive than last year. Last year, a beauty brand popsicle cost 1 jiao retail. This year it is 5 jiao in reserve certificates, a tenfold increase. This year's wholesale prices have also increased. For example, ice essence costs 5.5 yuan per dozen in new currency, wooden dolls and imperial concubines cost 9.9 yuan per dozen, and ice bricks cost 55 yuan per dozen. The retail price at the store is the wholesale price plus a profit of 10% to 20%. Ice essence costs 4 jiao in new currency per stick, wooden dolls and imperial concubines cost 1.3 yuan per stick, and ice bricks cost 6.5 to 7 yuan per box. As for Green Treasure fresh orange juice, the wholesale price is 19 to 20 yuan per dozen, so the retail price must also be 2.5 yuan per bottle. Golden Camel brand is 1.6 yuan per bottle, and Zheng Guanghe soda is 3 yuan per large bottle and 1 yuan per small bottle at retail. As for other cold drinks, they are also very expensive. A bowl of mung bean soup costs 1.5 yuan in reserve certificates. This is the minimum customers dare to order. If you go to a larger cold drink shop, it will cost no less than 5 or 10 yuan. When the weather is hot, the cold drink shops are full of customers, the electric fans are turned on full blast, and batches of people come like swarms of locusts. Everyone thinks it's a great place to cool off, and business is very prosperous. But how can the average citizen afford such expensive cold drinks? (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Second Emergency Epidemic Hospital - A Savior for the Poor and Sick</h3>
<p>When the cost of living is so high that it is difficult to solve the problem of three meals a day and a place to sleep at night, if you are unfortunate enough to get sick, asking for a doctor and taking medicine costs tens or hundreds of gold. It is difficult for people who rely on salaries to bear this, and even for ordinary people, it is impossible to maintain. This is an undeniable fact. If a poor person gets sick, then apart from relying on fate and nature, they can only wait for death. This is a social problem.</p>
<p>The New Pharmaceutical Industry Saves People from Suffering</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Xiaochu, Mr. Xu Guanqun, Mr. Yuan Hesong, Mr. Bao Guochang, Mr. Gao Peiliang, Mr. Yao Junzhi, and Mr. Zhou Mengbai of the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association have always been very enthusiastic about social undertakings. In view of the pain of the poor and sick who have no money to seek medical treatment, they convened a meeting two years ago to establish the Shanghai Emergency Epidemic Hospital to provide medical treatment to the poor and sick and to provide emergency treatment for epidemics. Since its establishment, it has been through three sessions, and it treats no less than 100,000 patients every year.</p>
<p>The Internal Organization is Well-Ordered</p>
<p>The internal organization of the hospital is as follows: Mr. Xu Xiaochu is publicly elected as the chairman of the board of directors, and Mr. Xu Guanqun and Mr. Yu Zhixue are the vice-chairmen of the board of directors. The medical affairs are presided over by Dr. Tong Zhiqing, who graduated with a doctorate in medicine from Germany. Many medical masters who graduated from domestic and foreign medical universities are hired to be responsible for internal and external emergency and other departments. The administrative affairs are presided over by Gu Yuanchang. All the clerks have the spirit of working hard and diligently, following Chairman Xu in handling health undertakings for many years, and they all have rich experience.</p>
<p>Outpatient and Inpatient Services are Free of Charge</p>
<p>The purpose of the hospital is to provide relief to the poor and sick. Therefore, whether it is outpatient, inpatient, medical treatment, food and accommodation, everything is completely free of charge. It can be called the only completely free hospital in Shanghai. Patients who come for treatment do not need introductions from acquaintances, and the wards are not divided into grades. All who come are treated equally, which is particularly praised by society. Recently, the weather has been hot and stuffy, and the number of patients has increased sharply. Most of the patients in the hospital have seasonal illnesses, and they all need to be injected with physiological saline. According to the inspection results, there are already many cases of true cholera. The hospital beds are full, and most of them are poor people, which shows the pain of the poor and sick in society and the urgent need for a hospital with a truly charitable nature.</p>
<p>The Spirit of Service is Admirable</p>
<p>In order to assist the authorities in epidemic prevention, the hospital sends dedicated personnel to various organizations to administer group injections at the request of various groups. They work hard in the hot summer, regardless of fatigue, and provide voluntary services. The groups that have received injections include Wuzhou Pharmacy, Baili Bazaar, Shengsheng Ranch, and Xinya Materials Factory, among others, with a total of more than 6,000 people injected. In order to instill common sense in patients, public health nurses give lectures on health common sense and cholera prevention methods in the waiting area every day, using simple and clear language. As for the doctors and nurses, their sincere attitude and earnest service are indeed due to the good leadership of the hospital authorities.</p>
<p>The Expenditure on Medicines is Huge</p>
<p>The hospital's expenditure on medicines must be over 1,000 yuan per day, so just the medicine cost alone requires 30,000 yuan per month. The source of funds, in addition to the donations from the members of the new pharmaceutical industry, also includes voluntary donations from all walks of life, with no other income. It is hoped that all philanthropists will visit the hospital for on-site visits and guidance, and provide as much assistance as possible. The cause of serving the public cannot be maintained by the efforts of one person or one industry. It requires the assistance of the public to maintain it.</p>
<p>People from All Walks of Life Enthusiastically Support</p>
<p>People from all walks of life who have personally visited the hospital all express their utmost sympathy, or voluntarily donate generously, or tell their relatives and friends to do their best to provide spiritual and material assistance. The most touching story is that of a poor child named Huang who, after recovering from his illness and being discharged from the hospital, donated all 2.5 yuan he had begged to the hospital. The hospital receipt number is 438, which is indeed a very touching thing. The hospital assigns a female service worker to write letters and provide various services for patients who come to the hospital. It is hoped that all sectors of society will refer the poor and sick to the hospital for diagnosis and treatment, which will be a savior for the poor and sick, and the merits are immeasurable. The hospital address is 47A Daxilu, telephone number 12355.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Investment Awaits Opportunity - Stock Market Decline Is Still Slight</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Shanghai Chinese stock market was increasingly stable. Investors were preparing to wait for an opportunity to pass through the bottom of July and then act. Those who held stock certificates were also unwilling to easily sell them cheaply, so although the various stocks still did not escape the fatigue of the past ten days, the decline was increasingly small. Only the Zhabei Water and Electricity stock fell more sharply, breaking into the 40 yuan range, down 1.5 yuan. New investors are still watching. Chinese energy has been stable for more than a week. Among the cultural stocks, only the China Book Company fell by 2.5 yuan. The Commercial Press and World stocks remained unchanged. Among the department stores, the New New Company rose by 0.5 yuan, and Wing On fell by 2 yuan. The price of the Innerwear stock was the same as the previous day. On the 40 yuan mark, there were many price-limited buyers. The Shanghai Woolen Mill also fell by 0.5 yuan. Among the new pharmaceutical stocks, the Sino-French stock retreated without advancing, and both it and the Xinya stock fell by 0.5 yuan, still seeking stability. The Daqin Huochai stock suddenly entered the 200 yuan range in a buying frenzy, up 7 yuan. The Nanyang Tobacco Company was unable to hold the 80 yuan mark for long and rebounded, rising for eight consecutive days, with a total increase of over 70 yuan. The Dasheng No. 2 Factory stock, which had risen by over 70 yuan, experienced a reversal after rebounding from the peak in the morning, with sellers selling off, down 7.5 yuan. Everything else was stable at over 270 yuan. As people's hearts are unsettled, there is unlikely to be any development this week, which has only two days left. It is possible that the capitalists will launch an offensive in the coming week, and the market price will then have a chance to recover. The stock price list is listed below.</p>
<h3>Public Debt Morale Increasingly Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday's over-the-counter public debt market continued to rise, and the trend was relatively strong. Due to the talk of raising another securities market, the scope of activity of the chips became increasingly wide, and it was even more clear that securities were not under control. People's hearts were greatly stabilized, and the market price gradually strengthened. Today is the end of July, and the 13th installment ticket is also due. It is said that most people still advocate that the interest tickets for the 12th and 13th installments should be included in the settlement. In this way, in the future, there will inevitably be different market prices for one or two installments of interest tickets. Yesterday, Tongli, Lianyi, Jiufeng, and Xinfeng continued to buy strongly. The market was more active, and as a result, except for the Wuchen stock, which was sold by Tongkang and did not rise or fall, the rest continued to rise by 2 and 5 jiao respectively. The transaction volume was approximately 1.8 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<h3>Military Notes Show Little Change</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market showed little change in Japanese military notes. The interbank trading price was between 5.555 and 5.552 yuan. The asking price for both buyers and sellers was 5.555 yuan. Banks and money changers offered 5.555 yuan to buy and 5.56 yuan to sell.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Grains Show Mixed Performance</h3>
<p>Beans: Yesterday, due to quiet supply and demand, there were few transactions, and the market was weak.</p>
<p>Corn: Demand was relatively good, and the market continued to rise. Yesterday, 100 bags of Wuhu corn were opened at a price of 108 yuan.</p>

<p>Wheat bran: Rural sales were considered expensive and turned weak, but sellers were not willing to loosen their prices too much, so the market hovered. Yesterday, 200 small bags of Sanxin wheat bran from May were opened at a price of 102.5 to 102 yuan.</p>
<p>Bean cake: Due to the drought affecting fertilization, sales were still weak, but sellers were still trying to hold on, and the situation tended to stabilize. It is estimated that 1,000 pieces of Xingji bean cake from April were opened at a price of 60.02 yuan.</p>
<h3>Soap, Candles, and Matches Show Different Trends</h3>
<p>The soap market for daily necessities had strong sales, the match market showed weakness due to the continuous sale of cheap goods, the candle market rose and fell suddenly, and the market price lacked change.

<h3>Cigarettes Show a Slight Uptrend</h3>
<p>Generally, hoarders in the cigarette market see that the risk has not yet been eliminated, so they dare not take large quantities. However, the Japanese cigarettes still have a strong trend, probably because the spot goods are gradually becoming scarce, so the price is quite upward. The opening prices for yesterday were Big British brand 8,350 yuan, Old Knife brand 5,200 yuan, Pinhai brand 4,500 yuan, Wuhua brand 3,250 yuan, Fairy brand 3,700 yuan, Japanese cigarette Jinqiang brand 1,420 yuan, Jindalou brand 1,850 yuan, Hongmeigui brand 1,000 yuan, Quanlu brand 1,540 yuan, Nianzhu Quanlu brand 1,550 yuan, Zhinan brand 1,250 yuan, Guoyan Jinshu brand 1,500 yuan, Meili brand 2,600 yuan, and Jinzita brand 3,000 yuan. The trend is lively.</p>
<h3>Qingjiang New Vegetables - First Arrival of 22 Packages</h3>
<p>New daylily vegetables have gradually appeared in various producing areas, but due to the difficulty in approximating prices, very few have been shipped to the Shanghai market. For the first batch of Xuzhou small-package vegetables, the traveling merchant’s counter-offer was still different. An electricity message has already been sent to Xuzhou for confirmation, and a response has not yet been obtained. Yesterday, the first batch of Qingjiang vegetables also arrived, totaling twenty-two packages. The asked price is similar to Xuzhou vegetables, but although the color is good, the quality is inferior. The traveling merchant’s counter-offer is a difference of twenty to thirty yuan to seek a deal.</p>
<h3>Sugar Stocks Settle Down</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar stock sheets of the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office’s turned flat. There were slight fluctuations in tea. At the beginning of the market, the group sand stock association’s sheet opened at 304 yuan, saw 302 yuan midway, and ultimately closed at 304 yuan. The red sand stock opened at 293 yuan, down slightly by two yuan from the previous day (the 27th). A total of 1,500 bags were traded.</p>
<h3>Hawthorn Cake Postponed Arrival of Goods</h3>
<p>Hawthorn cake is also one of the medicinal materials. The stock in Shanghai is very deficient. Yesterday, samples were sent in from the customer’s side. The quality is extremely dry. Traveling merchants valued it higher than hawthorn slices. The understanding is that a deal can hopefully be reached. Shipment to Shanghai for sale is hopefully imminent.</p>

<h3>Expectations for Students Applying for Scholarships</h3>
<p>— Mo</p>
<p>The third group of students applying for scholarships from this newspaper will undergo a screening test within the next few days. The staff firmly believes that their test results will be satisfactory to the donors. However, it also requires the students to redouble their efforts.</p>
<p>The fundraising for this newspaper's scholarships is based purely on the trust and generosity of all sectors of society. Although the amount of donations in each session cannot be considered huge, it has achieved considerable success solely on the basis of the warm sympathy of all sectors of society. Therefore, the benevolence and righteousness of all sectors of society, the cultivation of good social customs, and the guidance of promising youth are far greater than the amount of scholarship money on the surface. The donors are truly worthy of the title "righteousness reaching the heavens."</p>
<p>The students are all excellent students. They are almost unable to attend school due to their poor family circumstances. The parents of the students, although lacking in resources, have urged the students to achieve this success and are blameless. The students apply for this newspaper's scholarship with these excellent grades. This is the honor of the students, and it is also the willingness of the staff of this newspaper to work hard to make a small contribution.</p>
<p>The students are happily taking the exam today, not only to solve the tuition problem, but also to represent the achievements of their parents and alma mater, as well as the achievements of this newspaper's scholarship program. We will use the outstanding achievements of the students to encourage the development of scholarship programs in the future, and to thank all sectors of society for their enthusiastic donations. Students, strive for it!</p>
<p>Some of the students may be graduating, while others are still in elementary school. Building up the mountain with one basket of earth and cultivating people for a century is the responsibility of society, and it is also what we should strive to advocate. It is hoped that after the students have completed their studies, they will live up to the expectations of the donors. Then, even if the staff braves the scorching heat and severe cold, travels around for investigation, sweats and freezes while organizing and auditing, the joy in their hearts will be enough to comfort society.</p>
<h3>The Responsibility of Students</h3>
<p>— Tian Fuheng</p>
<p>A month before the start of summer vacation, Mr. Zhou told me about his classmates' plan to organize a summer tutoring school. It didn't materialize due to the lack of a suitable location, but they continued their efforts. Finally, school was out for summer vacation, and their opportunity came along. They worked separately, contacting people in all directions, especially a classmate named Mu who was most enthusiastic. He tirelessly ran around in this hot weather. As a result, they found a school site - the Peiyu Elementary School in Ziyang Lane, Wuding Road, which was named Zhenchuan Night School Summer Tutoring School. Although it is temporary, it is purely for social service. The funding is generously donated from various sources, and it is always their reward for their efforts! There are as many as sixteen teachers, all of whom are enthusiastic students. A total of 180 students were enrolled in this session. Although there were still applications afterwards, they had to decline due to the small classrooms. The classes are divided into elementary school lower, middle, high and junior high school first and second grades. The registration procedure is very simple, with a temporary deposit of two yuan. The fee will be refunded upon termination of the semester with the receipt. Elementary school books are distributed free of charge, and class time is set from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM every afternoon. The main courses are Chinese, English, Arithmetic, Physics and Chemistry, etc., all of which are based on the students' level, so teaching does not feel difficult.</p>
<p>The success of this event was truly unexpected. After just a few days of negotiation, everything went smoothly and could be carried out. Classes officially started on the 15th of this month, which is thanks to Principal Wang of Peiyu Elementary School. This group of students who are benefiting children are high school students who are still studying; they have always studied diligently in school, and in view of the fact that school fees are currently too expensive, the number of children who have dropped out of school is increasing; therefore, they founded the tutoring school regardless of all the difficulties, although it does not accommodate many people, but the effect will not be absent!</p>
<p>Due to the rise in the cost of living, tuition fees have to rise accordingly, several times higher than last year, which will naturally make it difficult for the parents of general students to bear this huge amount of money. Although there are requests for loan assistance in various places, these are all pathways for excellent students, and they do not have any effect on students of ordinary qualifications. It is important to know that these unfortunate dropouts cannot be ignored even more. Because the most talented, after dropping out of school, they can still make their own decisions and will not be wasted, especially those who are unfortunately abandoned, they stand on the vast road and will not know what to do. If they are not saved, they will be conquered by the environment and finally go down the path of depravity. Even if we create a capable person to govern the world, it is still better to reduce a social waste! In view of this, we cannot but pay attention to progressive education, and it is difficult to achieve this in a university that seems to be designed exclusively for the children of wealthy families, so let's bear this responsibility!</p>
<p>If we can truly be enthusiastic in service, we may as well spare one or two hours of our free time every day to organize this type of volunteer school to save these dropouts! We also hope that ladies and gentlemen who are enthusiastic about charity in society will give us more convenience, so that those who are doing things will not be disappointed. Our actions are telling others and making others know that modern students are not all muddleheaded and only engaged in mixing qualifications and mixing diplomas. On the other hand, we also hope that all schools can do their best to lend classrooms to volunteer schools at the lowest rent, and please ask experienced educators to guide us from time to time. This is also a popular small teacher system. Its strength is to obtain greater results with less money, and to accomplish the cause of the masses with the power of the masses. Students! Take on this responsibility! So that those students who are standing and wandering outside the school gates can have more opportunities to study!</p>
<h3>Mr. Ding Fubao's Struggle with Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>— Wu Xi</p>
<p>Ten years ago, because I was suffering from tuberculosis, I often learned about Mr. Ding Fubao from my uncle's mouth, and I learned about his struggle with tuberculosis when he was young, so I always had an image of an elder who had suffered from tuberculosis in my mind, and I had a strong desire to meet him. After the war, I finally achieved my wish, but I was so surprised that it was almost unbelievable that Mr. Ding had suffered from tuberculosis. His spirit was more full than that of young people, and he was radiant. After that, I received many teachings from the old gentleman, as well as many health preservation techniques, but his achievements were not accidental, but were fought from the bitter struggle. Now is the old gentleman's sixty-ninth birthday, and I will slightly write what I know to dedicate to the readers.</p>
<p>When Mr. Ding was young, he suffered from tuberculosis in his teens due to the poverty of his family and his congenital lack of strength. After having this terrible disease, not only did he not get proper treatment, but he also continued to study hard. One day when he was sixteen years old, he was diligently practicing calligraphy, and a fellow villager, Mr. Chen Zhongxing, sighed behind him and said: "You are about to die, what are you still practicing!" This shows the suspicion of his friends at the time. When he was in his thirties, he was still as weak as before, but he was not discouraged. On the one hand, he looked at life very open-mindedly, so-called one thought does not arise, one dust does not appear, purify the heart and eliminate the color, and cut off the knowledge to concentrate the spirit. These were all his old gentleman's motto at that time; on the other hand, he carefully studied hygiene and took himself as an example to fight hard with bacteria. His autobiography says: "I was often sick when I was young, and I paid attention to quiet recuperation. I have always adhered to the rules of hygiene in all aspects of diet and living. I began to become healthy at the age of twenty-eight." He also prefaced a book with the words: "The disease became more and more serious, so I cheered up and tried my best to resist the disease, changed the fierce to peace, changed the sadness to joy, and eliminated depression and annoyance. No matter what, I embraced optimism. As a result, my appetite increased day by day, and I was able to sleep soundly." This is a true record of his old gentleman's struggle.</p>
<p>Now, although he is old, his spirit is more vigorous and more invigorating, which is all caused by his indomitable courage. Now, in the midst of this great disaster, Mr. Ding resolutely takes it as his own responsibility to save young children from dropping out of school, and uses his birthday celebration for scholarship assistance and childcare. This shows how much Mr. Ding has worked hard.</p>
<p>The young people who are asking for scholarships must not lack the sick and weak. I hope they can refer to Mr. Ding's way of dealing with the world, and do not make the body and hard work go against each other. (In return for Mr. Ding's birthday celebration)</p>
<h3>A Letter to Loan Students</h3>
<p>Dear friends:</p>
<p>I know that you have been burying your heads at home recently, diligently preparing for your exam, and I am the same as you. When the cruel heat wave is forcing people, I have overturned my books several times, but when I think of the gentlemen in the newspaper who are busy for us, they are also enduring the attack of the heat wave with us. An array of self-condemnation arose from the bottom of my heart, so we cheered up and studied hard. Friend, do you feel bitter? No, definitely not! I dare to guarantee that there is not a single person in our group who shouts bitter. We are not bitter, we only feel that we are happy, we have hope, although we are a little poor, but poverty is not a disease. It is precisely because of the gift of poverty that we have created a piece of rough jade that can be carved. Look, aren't our graduates all crowned before the first grade? Aren't our conducts all above B grade? We don't have the bad habit of vanity and luxury. What we are willing to do is work hard, what we are willing to eat is bitterness, and what we can do is labor. Where did all these come from? Friend, I know you will not hesitate to answer me like this: it is poverty! Ah, dear friend, since we understand it, we must be happy with poverty, not only now, but also forever. Poverty will make you a perfect person. Look, aren't the great men of all countries in the world all successful through struggle and poverty?</p>
<p>We don't blame our parents for not preparing a beautiful and wealthy family for us so that we can enjoy a life of pampering and pampering. Not only that, but when our parents are sweating for our food and clothing, our hot tears can't help but burst into tears. We only hate why our parents gave birth to us so late, otherwise, we can at least give them some spiritual and material comfort. Our age and knowledge are really too small!</p>
<p>Some classmates think that our loan is shameful, which is not surprising to them, because in their eyes, one hundred and several tens of dollars is not a big deal. At most, it is their allowance for one or two weeks, and our ordinary poor classmates are mixed in the same school with them, so it is no wonder they think it is shameful, but looking back at their grades is shameful.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about society. Most people say that this society is selfish and cold, but in our opinion, that is just a one-sided assertion. The loan is a microscope of society, friend! Please also examine it carefully, and you will see that someone is sweating in the middle of the day to handle the heavy and precise work of appealing, crediting, and examination for others. Some people even give us the money they have exchanged for their own blood and sweat, so that we can enjoy it as long as we have our own knowledge. Is this society selfish, is it cold? Friend, when you see this, I guarantee you will shout wildly and say: "Ah, society, you are so great, you have given me more courage!" At that time, I beg you to hold back, that is, please think again about why they want to do this, is it because there is a you, there is a me? If you really think so, then society is wrong, and you and I are even more wrong! Friend, tell you, they are not for you, nor are they for me, but they are for education, they want to make us a useful talent!</p>
<p>Finally, please don't forget the exhortation and hope when your teacher is stamping and filling out the score for you, how much they love us this group, and when they leave, they still tell us to work hard to find questions to ask. Ah, dear teachers, respectable gentlemen who handle the loan, and enthusiastic people in society, we can't thank you for anything at the moment. All we have here is the sincere salute of our group of people! Friend, do you think we should say that? It's over, we will be able to meet in the examination hall in a few days.</p>
<p>I wish you a good result on the list</p>
<p>Your classmate Ji Shang</p>

<h3>In the Same Boat Through Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(7) Lightning</p>
<p>Wei Cheng said: "This is not necessarily a bad idea, who are these people?" Mrs. Ye Er said, "I don't know who the opium smoker is. The cigarette smoker is still young, he is Cheng Bing." Wei Cheng clenched his fists tightly, gritted his teeth, and said, "He is Cheng Bing, where is he, is he on the boat?" Mrs. Ye Er said: "I am talking about the past, Wei Cheng, calm down, don't listen to me, you will get angry, that's not right." Wei Cheng said: "What was Cheng Bing like at that time?" Mrs. Ye Er said: "At that time, your mother had no choice, she sat down, and told them where they lived, what their surnames were, and who they came out with. Cheng Bing and another person were really enthusiastic at that time. They found a small bamboo pole in the cabin and temporarily put a piece of cloth on it. The cloth said: Miss Li of Gangbei Township is here, hoping that the Li family will come to inquire. The words may not be like this, but the meaning is always like this. The boat crew was allowed to hold this small flag in their hands for the people on the shore who were crowding around to see. It took about one or two hours, but no one asked. Cheng Bing said, Miss Li, don't worry, although we are strangers, you don't know me, and I don't know you, but suddenly we are separated from our family, and suddenly we will get on our boat. This is also the Buddhist saying of fate. I estimate that in a few minutes, the conference will be arranged on the shore for us to see. After we have seen the conference, if your family still can't find you, and you can't find your family, then our boat will send you back to the Li family's house in Gangbei Township, which is always the most appropriate. Your mother was very grateful to Cheng Bing, and said: Mr. Cheng, where are you from, and who is this old gentleman? Cheng Bing refused to say, and only said: You don't need to panic at all. One can know a person's good and evil at a glance. Do you think we are good people or bad people? After saying this, the conference came, and both of them and your mother were standing on the bow of the boat to watch the conference. How could your mother have any thoughts of watching the conference? She was looking at the people on the road. This conference lasted for two hours, but it was neither your uncle nor the brothers and sisters in the same village, but the sky was getting dark." (142)</p>
