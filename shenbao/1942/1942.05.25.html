<h3>明室遣使羅馬敎廷</h3>
<p>「明永曆皇太后等信奉天主敎史料」一文，由徐宗澤司澤要據古代敎士紀述，證以史書，考據精確，其全篇巴分載本月十八。十九日本報。永曆皇太后等旣崇奉公敎，復遣派卜彌格司鐸與中國二靑年赴羅馬覲見敎皇，歷時數載，始達目的地，其中史料，俱屬可歌可泣，而使臣堅苦卓絕；百折不回之精神，尤足令人振奮。茲徐司鐸將此項史料編述爲「明室遣使羅馬敎廷」一文，用特揭載，並綴數言，藉以介紹。編者</p>
<p>明永曆皇太后旣已領洗入敎，遣使至澳門，請求彌撒，以謝主恩，然心猶所未愜，再欲遣使羅馬，覲見敎皇，以報告進敎事。</p>
<p>皇太后旣有遣使羅馬之意，於是興起人選之間題。龐天壽信德煥發，甚願前往，覲見敎皇，故自請去焉。但永曆帝以龐公年老力衰，時年六十二歲朝廷又須其輔佐，不准其求；且言瞿安德，卜彌格二司鐸中擇一前往爲宜。瞿安德司鐸會爲皇太后付洗，熟於宮中事。卜彌格司鐸波蘭人，生於一六一二年，一六二九年入耶穌會，一六四五年抵東京傳敎，後至澳門，一六四九年派至肇慶。兩司鐸於是商稟澳門上級神長；澳門神長會議之後，乃指派卜彌格司鐸奉使前往，時卜公年三十八歲，正當富有作爲之際，瞿公則留居肇慶皇宮中。龐天壽又指定二中國靑年與卜公同行，一名沈安德，一名陸若瑟。陸君中途得病折回，沈君則隨行至歐洲，時十九歲；二人均華服，以示中國固有之文化。</p>
<p>卜公臨行前，皇太后及龐天壽各有上敎皇書及耶穌會總長書四通，四畫均係華文，由瞿卜二公譯成拉丁文；中文原書，今保存在羅馬華諦岡圖書館中者，依伯希和說，祗有致敎皇書一通，至於致總會長之書，中文未之見，祇保有拉丁譯文云。然上海張菊生先生前自羅馬携歸「明王太后致羅馬敎皇詔書，」「明王太后致耶穌會總長書，」及「明龐天壽上羅馬敎皇書」眞跡攝影，曾刋布於東方雜誌第八卷第五號，故保存者有三書也。至於書牘之外表，據集寗張智良主敎說，明王太后之書繕寫於黃色絲箔，四週印有蟠龍，儼如四框，框外爲花邊，神彩照人；信封爲白絹所製，上有紅字，其文爲「因諾增爵代天主耶穌在世總師眞主聖父肅箋。」外有信筒，筒爲木質，用白絲裱糊，精美絕倫。龐天壽上敎皇之禀，正面爲「肅」字，有四方珠印，印文係「總督勇衞之印，」禀詞繕寫於紅色摺紙。龐公爲表示在耶穌會士手領洗之恩，在聖依納爵墓上，特獻銀板一方，鐫有中文及拉丁文。</p>
<p>致羅馬之書牘旣繕寫　成，於是在彌撒中，由龐天壽謹敬授與卜公。一六五〇　年十一月，卜公與二靑年離肇慶，溯江至澳門。卜公旣抵澳門，即辦理一切奉使手續；孰料澳門葡政府興起許多障碍，以爲明室偏安之局不能久持，將來滿淸恐有不利於己焉。然卜公卒能於一六五一年一月一日起程；同年五月抵臥亞。臥亞葡政府加諸卜公之阻力，較澳門爲尤甚，不准放行，經過半年之交涉，不得要領。卜公乃放棄航行之計，秘密遵陸而行，由印度，波斯，亞爾默你，小亞細亞，而達斯密爾納，改乘威尼斯船，一六五二年十二月初，抵威尼斯。威尼斯共和政府禁止卜公入國，旋經法國駐威公使之調解，乃得進入，且得議院之優待，威尼斯政府以中國公使之禮，接待卜公，沈君爲其隨員禮節隆重；此可謂中國朝廷與歐洲威斯尼共和邦之國際往來也。羅馬耶穌會總長，以卜公爲會士，任此公使之事，聞之頗爲不悅；及經卜公之禀陳詳情，乃准以私人資格入羅馬。孰料卜公於一六五三年抵羅馬後，神職班中有敵視卜公者，竟謂公冒充公使，潛進羅馬，公使之職純然爲耶穌會私造之事。於是爲卜公本人資格問題，奉使問題，興起許多難處。傳信部三次會，祇議決敎皇可以答覆明皇太后之國書而已。常此枝節橫生之際，敎皇意諾增爵十世於一六五五、年逝世，新敎皇亞立山七世即位，於是敎皇復書方於一六五五年十二月十八日發出，共二通，一復皇太后，一復龐天壽者。</p>
<p>卜彌格旣得復書，即赴葡國里斯木於一六五六年三月三十日乘輪回華；同行者有同會士八人，其中有柏應理，魯日滿二司鐸，同年十一月六日抵臥亞。時荷蘭人封鎖臥亞，會士乃分散取程。卜公飽嘗危難，於一六五八年初扺暹邏，擬轉道澳門，以滿淸旣主中夏不得往，乃改乘中國船，由一荷人行航，六月開抵安南之東京，待至一六五九年二月十六日，設法人廣西，奈滿軍嚴守，不能越一步。是時卜公心神勞瘁，卒致害病，於一六五九年八月二十二日卒於東京及廣西邊境間：其同伴沈安德爲之安葬，立一石碑及一十字。沈君乃避入山中，以避滿淸之捕緝，而卜公所帶回之敎皇復書，不得上呈明室。</p>
<p>自卜公離中國及其回華之多年中，在中國發生許多變故。瞿安德司鐸隨、永曆東奔西竄，一日無寗。一日當乘船避滿軍追逐之際，不幸被獲；滿人詳加容問，瞿公作十字聖號，又誦曰：「賴聖十字架，救我等於仇敵」經句以答之。二滿人乃一斧劈其頭，亦作十字形，分爲四塊。又一說謂，瞿公追隨永曆，在廣西某江，爲淸兵所捕，致之死地，投其屍於江中。又謂瞿公爲淸兵所害，龐天壽如禮葬之。至論死之年月，又不一其說，一謂在一六六三年，又謂一六六二年，或一六五八年者。</p>
<p>忠於永曆之龐天籌，亦先卜公而卒，臨終時，無司鐸在側，爲之施行聖事，然生時熱心事主，安然而終。其死之年，有謂在一六五八年者，有謂在一六八五五，或力六年者，傳說不一。</p>
<p>皇太后則於卜公起程後，五月即逝世，時在一六五一年五月已十日。小腆紀年云：永曆五年四月戊申，明太后殂於田州，五月葬南寗，上尊諡曰：「孝莊翼康聖皇太后。」然西史謂皇太后由吳三桂自緬甸擒歸後，於一六六二年卒於雲南；卒後，一切敎外之禮，永曆不准舉行。</p>
<p>永曆皇帝之末年更爲慘痛。帝目廣西，而雲南，而緬甸。緬甸王以四舟迎之送至京都阿瓦城，居一年有六月，其從行之衆有一千五百餘人，半皆散失。永曆十五年十二月明叛將吳三桂深入阿瓦城，緬王大懼，急將永曆與其皇族獻於軍前。次年四月，永曆在雲南被害，其太子公斯常定，時十五歲矣，同時遇害，馬太后瑪利亞，與王皇后亞納，及他宮女數人則被送至北京，居之別宮，禁不外出，惟款待尙優。然明皇后等不得見在京敎士，領聖事；幸有女敎友等時去問訊，以敎理相慰藉，是亦苦中之一慰。以上皆爲西史所記。</p>
<p>最近貴州南龍敎士Ｐ.Schrestter在Bulletin　Catholique　de　Peking，1915，PP，266.267刊佈一論，謂永曆與太子之墓，於一九一五年在南龍縣發現。此墓在一八五〇年前，已由亂兵墾掘，以盜珍寶，然一無所獲。今惟二堆泥土，無有能疑其爲皇陵者。</p>
<p>小腆紀年永曆被吳三桂虜殺事，尤淋漓盡致；桂王之末路，至爲悲慘：至此而明偏安之局，遂吿終盡。</p>

<h3>解決一切問題的　工部局新機構（六）　三、房租糾紛調解委員會</h3>
<p>又一張布告</p>
<p>在三月廿八日部局又發表了一張重要布吿。其中說非經調解委員會同意，業主不得勒令因經濟困難而無力付租之租戶遷移。其中尤其重要的一點是：在另有公吿以前的所有加租情事，非經該委員會認可，一概不生效力。</p>
<p>自從調解委員會於正月中成立以來，它已證明它的有益於社會。總共，已有了七十四個案件。租戶的佔四十一件，業主的僅佔三十三件。其中之五十三已獲解決。計和解者二十五件；撤回者七件；二十件不受理。尙有二十一件目前尙未結東。</p>
<p>這種案件的實際處理程序，會由該委員會一個律務方面的委員簡明地解釋如下：委員會在接到陳訴書，錄副轉送對方之後，限令對方於三日內答復。接獲答復後，便由一個局中辦事員召集雙方，設法勸他們和解。這不過是一次談話，以便找出他們爭論的眞正原因何在。十分之八，只爲了些小事，這樣，事情便和平地給解決掉了。</p>
<p>「假若和解已不可能，」那個律務委員說，「我們便設法使他們簽具一紙委託書，聲明同意將該案件送交我們調處，並依遵我們的判斷。委託書簽後，該案件便提呈於整個委員會之前，只等它下決斷了。」</p>
<p>「抱歉之至」</p>
<p>「那麼，假使業主與租戶不願簽具委託書呢，」他繼續道，」我們就吿訴他們抱歉之至，我們無能爲力……換句話說，我們不能侵奪法院的職權。這種的情形很少。」</p>
<p>「在少數情形中，當他們來見我們時，那案件已受或將受法院審理，調解委員便無力過問，」該委員會父說，「况且，兩造必需同意我們的處置。判斷一經由委員會決定，無疑地會得到任何法庭的支持。」</p>
<p>調解委員會極力審愼。使不偏袒任何一方。再也沒有比這更公平合理的方法了。對處理租金問題，該委員會通常的標準是，允許業主依照一九三七年佔價而定之租金，加倍計算。</p>
<p>這裏是個例子</p>
<p>這裏是許多案件中的一個例子。某房東收受其住戶每月三百八十一元的租金，其中包括供給暖氣設備與熱水。租約滿期後，租金不變，然房東要求加熱水費五十元。租戶反對，於是事情便提訴於調解委員會。委員會研究該案，發現一九三七年該處所佔定的租金僅一百二十九元六角五分。因此非但不准業主另加熱水費的要求，委員會決定將房租减低爲三百元。房東只得遵命照辦。</p>
<p>有一點很有趣，案件的大部分都是中國人的。他們都很願意到調解委員會來。法院也寗願他們如此。因此，他們不斷地都擁進工部局房租糾紛調解委員會去，業主與租戶，房東與房客，二個又二個……他們出來時全微微笑着。人生不能樣樣事情都如此和善地解決，眞可惋惜。</p>

<h3>為生存而奮鬭　猶太人的街頭市場　堅決沉毅機警冒險是他們獨特的性格</h3>
<p>本報特稿</p>
<p>記得會有人說過一個挖苦猶太人的笑話：、「富翁某，舉止闊綽，揮金如士；有一次，旅行猶太國，不幸得病，遵醫囑必須輸血，方可有救。這富翁就願出千金代價，向人買血，當時就有一個猶太人應微而來，願意將自己寳貴的血，輸給這富翁，得到這筆酬報·不料這個富病人經輸血後，完全食言，祗允給酬一半；以後這富翁又好幾次向猶太人買血，但他願出的代價，一次减少一次…」</p>
<p>理財經商堪稱能手</p>
<p>那個說笑話的講到這裏，就問：「為什麼一個揮金如土的富翁竟一變爲這樣吝嗇呢？」答案是這個富翁身內已有了大量猶太人的血。猶太人是素以吝嗇著稱的，富翁就中了猶太人吝嗇的「毒」。雖然這個笑話，未免太誇張，太挖苦，但它却局部地表明猶太民族的一種特性。猶太人不僅吝嗇，亦極勤儉，其實吝嗇和勤儉是一對孿生子。吝嗇的人一定勤儉，勤儉的人亦一定吝嗇。因爲如此，猶太人善於理財經商。到現在身後遺產糾紛還沒有解決希望的哈同，不亦是一個猶太人嗎？</p>
<p>可是躱在猶太人勤儉吝嗇的民族性底背後的，是他們堅決，沈毅，機敏的適應環境和創環境的本領。要知道現在猶太人是沒有祖國的·他們的足跡遍佈全世界，但是他們有冒險和進取的勇氣，不論環境是怎樣的險惡，不論受盡人家怎樣的欺凌和逼迫，他們始終不變爭取生存權利的決心和毅力。這就是他們到現在還能在這優勝劣敗的世界上取得相當地位的原因。</p>
<p>推銷貨品無孔不入</p>
<p>恐怕沒有人會堅定地相信在上海亦有幾萬個猶太人吧！數年以來，成批的猶太人民被驅逐，離開歐洲來到這國際都市的上海，做流落的難民。他們原來都居住德奧等國，發展固有的民族性，在金融界工商界甚至在政界上佔得很優先的地位。不幸遭受當地政府的嫉妬，受着磨難和摧殘，終至家破人亡，一無所有，被驅逐出境。他們赤手空拳，飄零到上海後，就在虹口一帶安頓下來，重張起求生的旗幟，踏上艱難的奮鬥底路程。</p>
<p>剛才已經說過猶太人是善於經商的，所以他們謀生之術，亦逃不出商業的範疇。中心區的各寫字間大廈內，往往就有這輩猶太人的出入。他們是商品的推銷員，拎着一隻公事皮包或箱籃之類，逐戶兜售。他們確能把握做生意的門檻，柔聲和氣地要人家　這樣，買那樣。他們很了解顧客的心裹，可是他們亦很保持自己的尊嚴。整潔的服裝，特別和氣的態度，往往會給人留下一個深刻的印像。　（未完）</p>

<h3>買即利機會　紗布橫跳</h3>
<p>— 泉</p>
<p>上週紗布市况，在中儲券一再掛牌，各項謠諑交流之下，完令陷入紊亂之境；終週市氣，驚浪駭濤，變動不可理喩；兼以上海紡織印染，申新　九，永安第三，保豐，安達，合豐等八家紗廠實行交還，人心愈益興奮；二十支雙馬廠單由前週六千元連破七千，八千，九千元三道大關；目平日軋開逾千之現貨，因受廠單可以車貨影響，漸趨軋攏；故價格昇騰不休。遙十支雙馬廠單最高竟見九千一百元，現貨見九千四百元。粗細紗布，亦一致再創新高價。十六磅雙象粗布見三百七十元，十二磅地球細布見三百三十元，剏爲曠古未有之顚峯。</p>
<p>週一因內地售盤倒懸，引起浮多吐售，雙馬一度回跌，小至五千八百七十元；但廠布以東疋橫跳，兀自上昇，週二以後，幻變日巨；高價迭出不窮，且其漲風往往在收盤之後。姑就棉紗廠單爲例：週二收盤爲六千一百二十元，但收盤後復昂至六千四百元；週三收盤爲六千三百三十元，但收盤後又做至六千七百元；又如週四收盤爲七千二百元，但塲外又做至七千八百二十元；更如週五收盤價爲八千元，但收盤後父漲至八千七百元，如期情形，簡直罕覩。語其原因：則實受金融上之刺激所反動者也。週末耳十支雙馬廠單收盤八千八百五十元，較上週飛漲二千七百六十元，現貨九千四百三十元，漲一千八白三十元。二十支雙地球九千二百元，漲二千零五十元；三十二支金寳星一萬三千二百元，漲二千二百五十元，十六磅雙象粗布三百七十元，漲九十斤元；十二磅地球粗布三百三十元，漲九十三元。</p>
<p>目下紗布實際銷胃仍陷停頓，本街零售門市生意受購實力荏弱影響亦屬有限，惟因金融上之不斷刺激，致引起敏捷反響，現時人心受上週大上落遺跡，已呈紊亂氣象，下週幻變如何，當仍隨金融市塲之震盪爲左右也。</p>
<h3>究屬顧慮重重　外股所漲尙</h3>
<p>— 桑</p>
<p>上週間之外股市况，初期穩中帶疲，形勢頗難振作；供求情形平常。迨至週三以後，突然急轉奇堅；此後續有發展。意者各方目光初方注意於棉紗軍票等方面之搜購，此後鑒於市價上漲過巨，忽思及外股未被拉高，於焉轉加靑睬，羣起購進，亦一窩風之現象也。全週成交額隨價格高漲而迅速增加，五天中共有三十五萬八千一百十股。（根據華人掮客公會逐日報吿）而以最後一天有十三萬八千二百七十五股最多，已打破去年十二月八日以來之紀錄，亦此次幣制變動聲中所造成者歟。</p>
<p>各種股款中，仍以紡織等股成交最多，最爲活躍，怡和紗廠初盤旋於三十八元半與三十九元半之間，及至週三，忽驟升至四十三元七角半，終爲四十三元，軋升三元半，中行最低見過二十三元七角半，此後一路激升至三十　元半，軋升六元二角半，信和紗廠自十八元半升至二十六元二角，軋升七元叫角：均爲紗價之大漲特漲所帶上，小額股漲勢較弱，紙業升十元，爲十二元一角；上海毛羢十七元，僅升三角；橡皮類各股交易尙稱不寂，內以地榜加侖丹及太拿馬拉等成交最多；惟價格上升甚微，約漲三角六分云云，實業股僅以業廣漲六元二角半較巨，其餘所漲有限。逐日成交不多。金融業各股，更乏人顧問，僅中和一種略有點綴而已，公用事業股除電車成交較暢外，餘則缺乏賣戶。</p>
<p>就物價有增無已而論，外股交易，已不以其安全　與營業情形決定之。而惟依其資產價値爲估價之根據，不過默察大量游資之趨向，似猶未集中於此，故漲力終不能與其他相頡頑；此究因前途顧慮重重之故耳。</p>
<h3>華股騰躍　金融刺激頻頻　漲度打開記錄</h3>
<p>上週華商股票市况，受金融之劇變，買風之盛，價格之暴，造成市上籌碼有求無供之新狀態。此種現象，向所未見，若謂投資踴躍，母寗謂人心恐慌之反映也。</p>
<p>就一週來股市而言，週初接承前週之漲風，步步見緊；自週三之新舊法幣掛牌，由七七而三次改縮後，漲風頓盛，買戶求進者，如風起雲騰；情緒之緊漲，非可言喩。百貨業股之中國內衣，由二十五元半升至三十四元半；永安公司六十四元半升至七十二元半；新新公司由七十四元升至八十元；新藥業股尤見鋒鋩。新亞新股目週四穿出四十元關後，扶搖直上，昂全四十四元半。中法新股，初呈平定，機即猛挺，達七十六元高價，潛勢仍盛。生化優先，週來頓見飛黃，由二十二元半挺至三十一元許。中英藥房已升至一百九十元成交。其他如五洲，民誼，信誼等，莫不俏俐非常；紡織業股籌碼本少，受市勢之刺激後，挺升更勁；大生　廠由五十五元升至一百元；又三廠漲四十五元；達豐染織升五十五元。實業股中以文化業股漲勢最盛，世界新股竟達一百十元之高峯；商務，中華亦頻漲不已。藝林彩印，由八十五元升至一百零七元半；大中華火柴所漲無多，蓋其票面已超過六倍故也。新都飯店，先挺後平，公用業股如華商電氣，衝出二十元關，站至二十一元五角之間，閘北水電亦迫近二十元矣。</p>
<p>展望本週市勢，苟非金融趨勢由動盪而穩定，則股市之機續上升，殆意中事。然值得注意者，市上各股籌碼，經上週暴騰後，賣戶固已見稀；而買戶因價格過高反呈觀望態度，故預測本週間之成交數，恐難若上週之繁榮也。</p>
<h3>環境有利變化　債市好轉</h3>
<p>— 嶺</p>
<p>上週間公債市祝，買賣雙方之搏鬥已臻白熱化，變動至爲劇烈：跌停板後忽轉漲停板，誠爲去年十二月八日以來所未見之奇績；最後賣方拋出雖多，卒以買方賴其無窮盡之資力祗吸不放，並得環境上之援助，乃於奄奄一息之中，力起沉疴，終各升九角至四元二角不等，全週成交大旺，共計約有一千三百萬元光景。</p>
<p>當週一週二兩天，整個局勢，幾爲買方所控制；凡觸鬚所及，價即憂然下瀉。絲丙統戊首先　停板，統　繼之；此時各債已僅值票面之四六折至九折，似乎前途不勝悲觀。殊不知債市在此驚風駭浪中，金融界仍在不斷進行扶植工作。抑目隨環境之險惡而愈益努力；經營結果，居然大有可觀，並獲得北幫金融界及紗花幫等之臂助，故於週三，即迅速轉成漲停板，此後三天，雖中途小有曲折，然賣方已無力轉移局勢：各方人心欣欣向榮，復受幫制變動及物價飛漲之刺激，腳地益覺穩固。</p>
<p>查上週來賣方所拋之　貨，爲數依然甚巨；然竟全爲買方如數吸去。其實力之雄厚，非普通尺度可以衡量。而最近間劃頭貼現率之奇昂，公債作價因以劃頭計算，故無形中按照貼水比率又須賤去九折光景，際茲大量現鈔均爲投機者所席捲以去之時，劃頭頭寸頗感缺乏出路，於是購買公債，遂爲一舉二得之事。因此雖在幣變叢生之秋，而債市獨能保持堅勢，足見其基礎之鞏固，絕非外來勢力所能搖憾。一般人已預料公債將爲游資之最後歸宿地。</p>
<h3>傳說竟非謠言　幣市插翅高飛</h3>
<p>上週間外幣市况，果如投機家渴望，大起漲風。爲勢之烈，不特出於一般投機家意料以外，且創空前變動之紀錄。蓋一月以來市上盛傳之提高儲備掛牌之說，竟吿實現；排日一陞，愈演愈烈。因之各方買氣亦隨之愈陞而愈强，軍用票週初已自七元四角半步升至八元一角半。週　（五月二十日）改牌實現，但較預料者爲少，故會退至七元七角七分；</p>

<h3>不要毒害孩子！</h3>
<p>— 嚴正</p>
<p>在一所醫院的候診室裏，看見一個婦人抱着一個孩子：婦人患着厲害的花柳病，走起路一拐一拐的；孩子則臉上手上脚上生滿着瘡。</p>
<p>孩子兀是睜着一雙發亮的眼睛，不斷地吮吸着婦人的奶！</p>
<p>三兩個好心腸的病人勸阻那婦人說：「你自己在發病，不要給你的奶他吃吧！已經有九個月，喂一點稀飯不是也可以嗎？」</p>
<p>那婦人聽了，沒加可否，只說她的病是她老板傳染給她的，她自己曾生過四個孩子，都在產後不久死了；這個孩子是打育嬰堂裏抱來的。說時，充分顯示了她的「婦德」，沒有絲毫怨尤的表情。</p>
<p>孩子兀是睜着一雙發亮的眼睛，不斷地吮吸着婦人的奶！……</p>
<p>但這樣的毒害孩子到底是顯而易見的。在另一方面，一般父母們在精神上傳給孩子的毒，因爲多是不自覺的，危險性就更大。在親權於多數的家庭中還佔着優勢的目前，像上面的事正是屢見不鮮的：做父母的主觀地或下意識地將自身的思想上，行爲上的老毛病傳染給孩子，要孩子亦步亦趨，處處舉他們的樣，其實他們自己原來就不像樣！我們知道孩子比成人富有「可塑性」，這樣在未長成之前，就已給弄得失去了「人」的靈魂！</p>
<p>要孩子長成為真正的人，我想，只有立刻停止喂哺有毒的奶。如果沒有富有營養的牛乳，那麼便是稀飯也好！</p>
<p>不然，失去了「人」的必備條件，想持續生命已覺為難，又怎麼談得上發展？</p>
<p>自然</p>
<h3>毒氣專家　昆虫</h3>
<p>— 羅文</p>
<p>在人類尙未發明毒氣之前，昆虫早已在應用着種種毒瓦斯了。有幾種螞蟻能够噴射强烈的「蟻酸，」倘使有什麼人魯莽地把面孔趨近蟻窠，他的皮膚一定會燒焦的。道股强烈的氣息，往往足以引起鼻子的刺戟。這顯然是現代芥子氣的先驅。</p>
<p>最善利用毒氣的要算是甲虫了。倘使受粗暴的捉弄時，連美麗的瓢虫也會發出一種臭氣的。可是手段最高妙的却是三分之一英寸的深藍帶紅色的向四面發散的液體。當道液體一經和空氣接觸，它就微微爆發，變成有惡臭的藍氣。作爲防禦工具它是冉有效沒有的，結果使小小的放屁虫輕易地逃避許多設法捕食它的大虫。</p>
<p>能够發出猛烈之毒氣的另一種甲虫是那形像兇惡的截尾虫。這是園子裏常見的殼虫，生性好鬥。即使有一根手杖觸近時，它也會聲勢洶洶對它攻擊的。首先它把尾巴捲起，於是從尾端的二條黃色的腺放出强烈的臭氣。</p>
<p>此外還有一種會發臭氣的園子裏常見的昆虫。那就是在夏天黃昏時我們可以看到在園中無力地飛翔着的草蜻蜓。它的體軀作靑色，而有着一對形似珍珠的黃色眼睛。受人捉弄時，它竟然會發出一種臭氣，雖用肥皂與水竭力洗去也無法洗淨。</p>
<p>在昆虫的幼虫中最擅長發射毒氣的是歐洲大蛾。當它安靜地取食時，它好像是溫和而美麗的虫兒。可是一經受到敵人的威嚇，它馬上把頭縮回，現出極兇惡的「面貌」。同時它像充滿憎恨的模樣伸展尾端的二根紅綫。倘使這種神經戰」仍不能擊退敵人的話，那麼它就射出一種非常難聞的酸液。</p>

<h3>夜明鏟</h3>
<p>— 沈雄</p>
<p>戰爭時期，一切工作皆加緊，所以夜晚也常要工作，但晚間戶外工作非常不便，伸手不見五指，還能做什麼事呢。夜明鏟便爲應這種需要而生，鏟上有一個燈頭，所以無論在煤庫中或園子中工作，都能看淸目標。其製造法係以夾子把閃光燈繫在鏟的握手處；農夫的鏟或鋤上若有了這種設備，雖日落西山也仍可照常工作。淸道夫或園工也可在夜間淸除道路上的積雪了。</p>

<h3>哭笑機器</h3>

<p>美國有位物理學家發明一種神秘的機器，牠能發出某種特殊電波，使人感受後，便會大哭或大笑不止。預備把道機器裝置在劇臺上，當演戲時，若爲喜劇則播放快樂電波，觀衆的神經一個此種電波後，便莫不哄堂大笑連續數小時。若爲悲劇，則播放悲哀電波，觀衆便痛哭流涕，如喪考妣。不論劇情如何平凡，演員的技術何等拙劣，都能收得出異的効果的。</p>
<p>有人預料「哭笑機」問世後，劇塲的賣座盛况恐將不可想像，同時這機器也將使劇壇放異彩。</p>
<p>我都以爲這是不可能，因爲使用這種機器以　，觀衆的情感都出於被動，不自然，像被按了笑竅似的狂笑（或大哭），他們對於劇情就無法欣賞了，結果徒使神經過分緊張，顧客是決不會光臨的。</p>

<p>翠珍道：「我聽了，立刻天旋地轉，頭昏眼花，像有一枝箭刺着我的心，可憐我就昏厥過去了。」國芳道：「後來你那表妹呢？」珍翠道：「我昏厥了過去，什麼都不知道了。」國芳自覺間的可笑，又說道：「翠珍姊，你應該忍耐，達觀，我不是幫着你說你舅舅壞話，他根本是小人，一個人和小人生氣做什麼？如果這裹二伯母允許的話，你丟了鄕裏，隨我往上海去住幾天，也讓你舅舅知道翠珍姊不一定要住在鄕裏。」翠珍笑道：「像我這種人，配到上海去嗎？到上海去，給人家看做一個使喚丫頭，倒是有分。」國芳道：「那是什麼話？你不要把上海人估量得太高，在上海住的女子，難道一個個都是雍容華貴像個小姐像個少奶奶嗎？便假定說她們有幾分像，但是翠珍姊，也不見得不像，摩登會輸給人家嗎，美麗會輸給人家嗎？」</p>

<h3>The Situation on the Kharkov Front is Heated: German and Soviet Forces Fight a Desperate Battle, Tank Units Reinforcing Continuously, the Area Likely to Become a War of Attrition</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency dispatch from somewhere on the Soviet border, 23rd: According to the latest news, the situation in the Kharkov area is roughly as follows: The weather on the front has suddenly become hot, unlike previous years, with temperatures reaching 90 degrees Fahrenheit in some places. The battle situation is chaotic, with both sides claiming victory in their reports. The German side claims that the German army has managed to prevent the Red Army from reaching the outskirts of Kharkov. On the Soviet side, it is said that General Timoshenko has been intercepting German counterattacks in the Barvenkovo area. Street fighting has broken out in certain "important" locations, referring to what is likely Chuguev. The Soviet side claims that the Red Army has occupied a certain town southwest of Izyum, apparently Svyatogorsk.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency dispatch from Stockholm, 24th: Heavy fighting has been ongoing in the Kharkov area for twelve days. The situation appears to have stabilized, with conflicting claims of victory. According to the German side, the Soviet offensive is running out of steam, and the Red Army's 23rd Division has been decimated, with the German army conducting mopping-up operations. However, the Soviet side claims that the Red Army is consolidating its occupied positions in order to continue its offensive. According to neutral observers, there will be no dramatic developments in the area in the coming days, and it may even become a war of attrition.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency dispatch from the German Führer's headquarters, 20-something: This afternoon's German war bulletin stated that after the German army launched a counteroffensive, elite Soviet forces were surrounded south of Kharkov and have repeatedly failed to break out. Reinforcements have been blocked, leaving them unable to provide assistance.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from London, 24th: According to a Reuters correspondent in Moscow, German and Soviet forces are still fighting a desperate battle in the Kharkov area. Both sides are continuously reinforcing with large numbers of tanks, aircraft, and artillery. The German army is even deploying reserves originally intended for the decisive battle to the front lines. When German infantry are unable to breach the Soviet steel wall, they often use massive tanks, divided into teams of forty or sixty, to launch fierce assaults. According to Soviet Air Force reports, in a single day, they destroyed seventy-two German tanks, one hundred and fifty vehicles, and one thousand soldiers. However, German defenses remain extremely strong, especially the tank defense positions.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 24th: The German High Command issued a statement last night regarding the fighting in the Kharkov region on the Eastern Front, stating that the battle of Kharkov is extremely difficult, not only because of the intensity of the fighting, but also because of the hot weather. The temperature there has reached 30 degrees Celsius, which is unusual for this time of year. Soviet forces have been joining the battle with tank units for several days, but the strong German resistance has repelled all Soviet attacks. The German Air Force has been very successful in supporting ground operations. Due to the Soviet numerical superiority, they have achieved local victories, but German and allied counterattacks have ultimately driven the Soviets back. Although the details of Soviet losses in the battle of Kharkov have not been finalized, it is confirmed by all parties that the number of Soviet casualties during the offensive must be high. The German Air Force was very successful in supporting ground operations in the Kharkov area on Friday. When German aircraft bombed Soviet tank units, they destroyed seven tanks and three hundred vehicles of various types. Twenty-four Soviet heavy trucks loaded with gasoline caught fire after being hit.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 23rd: Military circles here have announced that the German Air Force is extremely active on the Kharkov front, with fighter and dive bombers repeatedly bombing enemy bases and communication lines, destroying seventy enemy vehicles and shooting down twelve enemy aircraft.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 24th: It is claimed here that German aircraft carried out an air raid on Sevastopol the day before yesterday, targeting shipyards, naval barracks, aircraft factories, and supply facilities. Anti-aircraft fire was ineffective, and one enemy aircraft was shot down. All German aircraft returned safely to their bases.</p>
<p>Germany Gains the Initiative</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 24th: The semi-official newspaper "Deutsche Nachrichten" summarized the battle of Kharkov yesterday as follows: The German war bulletin on Saturday released details of the battle of Kharkov, emphasizing the importance of the battle and the strength of the Soviet forces. The German war bulletin stated that the Soviet forces concentrated in the battle of Kharkov were very strong, proving that the Soviets had large-scale military objectives in this battle. According to official reports, the Soviet forces in the Kharkov area consisted of twenty infantry divisions, three cavalry divisions, and three tank brigades, a force even stronger than that on the Kerch Peninsula. Those responsible in Berlin conducted a detailed review of the situation in Kharkov, stating that the initiative there is now in the hands of the German army. The Soviet offensive, which began on May 12th, has completely failed. After repelling the Soviet offensive, the German army immediately launched a counteroffensive. On May 22nd, the German High Command announced that after gaining the initiative, the German army concentrated its counterattack, cutting off most of the Soviet rear lines of communication. The Soviet offensive plan was completely thwarted. Therefore, the second stage of the war in the area is a German mopping-up operation in the Kharkov area. Well-informed sources in Berlin say that the German operation is proceeding very smoothly. The counteroffensive launched by the German army after repelling the Soviet offensive is of considerable scale. However, the German offensive on the Eastern Front, which the world is watching, has not yet begun. However, after the German army accelerates its offensive, it may launch a general offensive on the Eastern Front.</p>
<p>Hungarian Forces Fighting on the Eastern Front</p>
<p>Havas News Agency dispatch from Budapest, 23rd: A communique from the General Headquarters here stated that the Hungarian army has also dispatched troops to participate in the fighting on the Kharkov front.

<h3>Hull Warns the Nation; Only Joint Efforts Can Produce Results</h3>

<h3>Blackout Drills on Manhattan Island</h3>

<h3>Axis POWs in the U.S. Treated According to International Convention; U.S. Denies Mistreating Japanese Residents</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency dispatch from Washington, 23rd: The State Department has announced that the treatment of American prisoners of war by Japan, Germany, and Italy is as follows: American prisoners of war and confined American citizens in Japan are allowed to speak privately with neutral observers, although Japanese officers are sometimes present to monitor. None of the prisoners or confined citizens complained of any violations of the Geneva International Convention on Prisoners of War. Their rations are the same as those received by Japanese soldiers. Some prisoners are engaged in agricultural work and are paid. Confined citizens are either housed in camps, confined to their own homes, or allowed to move freely after taking an oath. Confined American citizens in Germany are housed in buildings with heating equipment, receive the same rations as German soldiers, and are allowed to see their families, communicate with the outside world, and receive food and clothing from outside. Most of those who are ill have been released, and those who remain are in good health. In Italy, American citizens are only confined to their own homes by the authorities. In short, the U.S. government intends to apply the Geneva Convention to enemy residents in the United States as much as possible, so that Americans in enemy countries can also fully benefit from the Convention. However, information on the situation of Americans confined in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies has not yet been received here.</p>
<p>Dispatch from Washington, 23rd: The State Department and the War Department today firmly denied reports that Japanese residents in the U.S. were being mistreated. Official sources pointed out that since the outbreak of the war, the Justice Department's first task has been to take several positive measures to protect the rights of foreigners, including residents of Axis countries. Axis diplomats were housed in hotels before returning to their countries and were not allowed to leave freely, but they lived comfortably under the protection of the U.S. government. Other Axis residents were also treated very well in all aspects. Some who had to relocate for military reasons were assisted by the U.S. government in finding new homes, and their standard of living was actually higher than before the war.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Develops Malayan Minerals</h3>
<p>Allied News Agency dispatch from Shonan City, 23rd: The Malayan Military Administration began to restore the development of Malaya's resources immediately after the Japanese army occupied Malaya, and work has progressed rapidly. Particular attention is paid to the development of minerals such as bauxite, tin, and iron, which are most needed during wartime. Mr. Okaguchi Ichigen, Chief of the Mining Section of the Ministry of Industry, spoke on the 23rd about the recent situation of mineral (iron and steel) development as follows: The purpose of the Japanese army in developing bauxite mines in Malaya and Loeh Island is to meet Japan's needs. Although the Pasir Panjang mine near Batu Pahat in the Malay Peninsula was almost completely destroyed by enemy forces, Ishihara Sangyo Co. is resuming operations after the Japanese army occupied the area. The current production has exceeded pre-war production. The Bukit Timah mine, about sixteen or seventeen miles from Pasir Panjang, was also destroyed by enemy forces, so it will take some time to restore its former appearance. A considerable amount of accumulated inventory there has now been moved out. There are also bauxite deposits near Malacca City, which were discovered after the Japanese army occupied the area and are now being developed. Although the mines are scattered throughout the area, the reserves are estimated to be about 3.5 million tons. Twenty technicians have been selected and are conducting surveys, and mining is expected to begin around November. There is also a bauxite mine on the south coast of Johor, which Ishihara Sangyo Co. of Japan had requested permission from the British government to develop before the war, but was rejected. The reserves are estimated to be about 15 million tons, which alone could supply Japan for several years. Also, because there are still a few landmines unexcavated in the dense forest area, they are being cleared and railways are being laid. It is expected that from this year to next year, all of Japan's steel needs will be supplied by this mine. Preparations are also being made for development. The Loeh Island mine was previously operated by the Dutch Wellington Tin Mining Company. The quality of the tin ore on the island is very good. Although the mine equipment was once destroyed, it was soon repaired by the Japanese and will be mined this month. In short, there is no shortage of bauxite ore. Once the machinery and other facilities are complete, large-scale production will be possible, and there will be no problem with the replenishment of ships. As for iron ore, the Sri Medan mine in Johor has been thoroughly destroyed. However, the Rengam mine in the same state, the Bukit Besi mine in Terengganu, the Maran mine in Pahang, and the Bukit Besi mine in Kelantan are still intact. The amount of ore and inventory being transported from Bukit Besi and Dungun is considerable and of excellent quality. The Penang tin smelting plant resumed operations on April 23. Although the generator at the Pulau Brani smelting plant in Shonan was destroyed, it is planned to temporarily close it down because the Pulau Loeh and Pangkal Pinang smelting plants are already in operation. Tin mines have been restored to their former state. The Tekka Tin Mine, the largest tin-producing area in Malaya, is also rapidly recovering and can produce several tons this month. Recently, it was decided to purchase Chinese ore at appropriate prices. The Bangka tin mine was previously operated directly by the Dutch government. When the enemy forces retreated, they took the generator. The Mentok and Pangkal Pinang smelting plants on the island have now been repaired. There are many tin mining areas on other islands, such as Wellington Island and Singkep Island. If they can all be mined, the supply will be excessive, so there will be a need to limit production in the future. In addition, the production of tin from Malaya and Sumatra will be operated by the Toyo Mining and Sunan Placer Mining companies. Coal production in Malaya has always been very weak. The Batu Arang mine in Kuala Lumpur is the only coal mine in Malaya. The coal produced is supplied to Malayan power plants and tin mine railways. The mine railway has also been damaged. After the Japanese army occupied the area, it entrusted Mitsubishi Mining to repair it. The current production is close to pre-war levels.</p>
<h3>Mahatma Gandhi Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Allied News Agency dispatch from Stockholm, 23rd: According to a New Delhi dispatch in The Times of London, Gandhi issued a statement advocating that British and American troops should withdraw from Asia.

He is currently putting pressure on the British government in this regard.</p>
<p>Allied News Agency dispatch from Lisbon, 23rd: According to news from New Delhi, the "Indian Times" reported that Grady, head of the U.S. Technical Mission to India, had submitted a proposal to the U.S. government regarding the promotion of Indian industry. It has now been learned that the proposal also includes another proposal, namely, based on the plan proposed by the Viceroy of India, Lord Linlithgow, that the United Kingdom and the United States be responsible for planning to increase Indian munitions production and guiding transportation.</p>

This is natural, but the content of the talks cannot be disclosed at this time.</p>
<h3>Some U.S. Congressmen to Visit Britain</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency dispatch from Washington, 22nd: Political figures here have said that some members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives will soon travel to London to visit the British Parliament as a sign of strengthening the bond between the U.S. and Britain. However, the Republican Party has expressed opposition, believing that it is inappropriate for some members of Congress to visit Britain on the eve of the midterm elections. However, supporters believe that this trip will not only be beneficial to the union of the two great democracies, but also allow them to exchange views on the future peace organization, forcing the United States to actively participate in planning the post-war European organization. Whether the U.S. wants it or not, the U.S. will inevitably participate in the future peace conference and any post-war Allied conference. Therefore, after this war, the American isolationist faction will not be able to make a comeback.</p>
<h3>Argentine New Appointments: Ambassadors to Mexico and Brazil</h3>

According to President Camacho, he has convened an emergency meeting of the Senate and the House of Representatives to pass a bill in accordance with the constitution authorizing the President to declare war on the Axis powers. According to custom, the President must give the parliament ten days to prepare when convening a meeting, but this time it is being held early due to the seriousness of the situation. The session is expected to last on the 25th or 26th. Reuters also reported that there are more than 20,000 Axis expatriates in Mexico, and the government is expected to submit a bill to parliament prohibiting Axis expatriates from marrying local women. In addition, the Mexican army has 70,000 regular soldiers, 300,000 militia, 100,000 merchant soldiers, 15 warships, and 2,000 sailors.</p>

In addition, according to Speaker Renault, Parliament can declare war on the Axis powers after the meeting, and no one in both houses will oppose it. Chief of Staff General Sangis went to the Presidential Palace tonight to report on the measures taken by the Army Department to deal with the situation.</p>
<p>Strong Patriotic Sentiment Among Farmers and Workers</p>
<p>Shanghai Tongxun News Agency, Lisbon, 24th. According to news received here from Mexico City last night, people in the city unanimously believe that Mexico is on the eve of war and will undoubtedly participate in the war, especially the workers, because they sympathize with the Soviet Union and openly express the need to declare war on the Axis powers. Although farmers and people outside the big cities oppose the war, it is not enough to change the trend. It is expected that the government and the military's appeal will arouse the patriotic sentiment of the farmers. Currently, people are paying attention to the activities of former President Cardenas, who also supports participation in the war. It is rumored that he may be appointed as Minister of Defense or hold an important position in the military.</p>
<h3>Two US Ships in the Gulf of Mexico: Berlin Announces Allied Naval Losses</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 24th. It was reported yesterday that two ships were sunk by torpedoes in the Gulf of Mexico, one of which was apparently hit by a new type of explosive torpedo. The ship was attacked on Tuesday, and immediately caught fire after being hit. The gunners were unable to fire back, the fuel tank also caught fire, and the wireless failed. Twenty-one crew members were killed or fatally injured. The ship was then towed into a port in the bay. According to news from New York, a US cargo ship in the Gulf of Mexico was attacked on Tuesday by two or more submarines from both sides. It sank three minutes after being hit by a torpedo. Thirty-six crew members were killed. The ship was also armed, but because five of the six gunners were killed by the first torpedo, and another gunner was shaken into the sea, they were unable to resist. A submarine then surfaced to observe the scene, but did not harass or interrogate the surviving crew and passengers.</p>
<p>Shanghai Tongxun News Agency, Berlin, 24th.

<h3>Italian-French Relations</h3>
<p>Shanghai Tongxun News Agency, Rome, 24th. Gaeta published an article in "Italian News" yesterday, stating that Italian-French relations will never become a serious problem, so it is not appropriate to discuss them publicly. Italy's attitude towards this issue is very clear. Italy's views are the same as Germany's, and the interests of Germany and Italy are one.</p>
<p>Shanghai Tongxun News Agency, Rome, 24th. Famous Italian journalist Gaeta published an article in "Italian News", strongly criticizing an article on Italian-French relations written by the "Basel National Daily". Gaeta wrote that there is no need for public discussion of Italian-French relations at present, because Italy has already made a clear statement. A certain Swedish newspaper has failed to abide by its neutral obligations and has written articles discussing war issues and the interests and status of belligerent countries, with many words supporting the United Kingdom and the United States, directly wanting to offend the aversion of Germany and Italy.</p>

<h3>Ming Dynasty Envoy to the Roman Curia</h3>
<p>The article "Historical Materials on the Ming Yongli Empress Dowager's Belief in Catholicism" by Xu Zongze, a judicial official, is based on ancient Catholic records, verified with historical books, and meticulously researched. The entire article was published in this newspaper on the 18th and 19th of this month. Since the Yongli Empress Dowager and others worshiped Catholicism, they sent Father Bu Mige and two Chinese youths to Rome to pay homage to the Pope. It took several years to reach their destination. The historical materials are all moving, and the envoys' perseverance and indomitable spirit are particularly inspiring. Now Father Xu has compiled these historical materials into an article titled "Ming Dynasty Envoy to the Roman Curia", which is specially published, along with a few words of introduction. - Editor</p>
<p>Since the Ming Yongli Empress Dowager had been baptized into the Church, she sent envoys to Macau to request Mass to thank the Lord for His grace, but she was still not satisfied. She wanted to send envoys to Rome again to pay homage to the Pope and report on her conversion to the Church.</p>
<p>Since the Empress Dowager had the intention of sending envoys to Rome, the question of personnel selection arose. Pang Tianshou's faith was strong, and he was very willing to go to pay homage to the Pope, so he requested to go. However, the Yongli Emperor believed that Duke Pang was old and weak, and that the court needed his assistance, so he did not allow his request, and said that it would be appropriate to choose one of the two priests, Qu Ande and Bu Mige, to go. Father Qu Ande had baptized the Empress Dowager and was familiar with matters in the palace. Father Bu Mige was a Pole, born in 1612, joined the Society of Jesus in 1629, arrived in Tokyo in 1645 to preach, and later went to Macau. He was sent to Zhaoqing in 1649. The two priests then consulted their superiors in Macau. After a meeting of the Macau superiors, Father Bu Mige was appointed to be the envoy. At that time, Father Bu was 38 years old, at the height of his abilities. Father Qu stayed in the Zhaoqing Imperial Palace. Pang Tianshou also appointed two Chinese youths to accompany Father Bu, one named Shen Ande and the other named Lu Ruose. Mr. Lu fell ill and returned halfway, while Mr. Shen accompanied him to Europe. He was 19 years old at the time. Both were dressed in Chinese clothes to show China's inherent culture.</p>
<p>Before Father Bu left, the Empress Dowager and Pang Tianshou each wrote four letters to the Pope and the General of the Society of Jesus. All four letters were in Chinese, translated into Latin by Fathers Qu and Bu. The original Chinese books are now preserved in the Vatican Library in Rome. According to Bo Xihe, there is only one letter to the Pope. As for the letter to the General of the Society, the Chinese version has not been seen, only the Latin translation is preserved. However, Mr. Zhang Jusheng of Shanghai previously brought back from Rome photographs of the "Edict of the Ming Empress Dowager to the Roman Pope", the "Letter of the Ming Empress Dowager to the General of the Society of Jesus", and the "Letter of Pang Tianshou to the Roman Pope". These were published in the fifth issue of the eighth volume of the "Eastern Magazine", so there are three preserved books. As for the appearance of the letters, according to Bishop Zhang Zhiliang of Jining, the Ming Empress Dowager's letter was written on yellow silk foil, with coiled dragons printed around it, like four frames, with flower borders outside the frames, and the colors were dazzling. The envelope was made of white silk, with red characters on it, the text of which was "Respectfully presented to Innocent, General Teacher of Jesus Christ on earth, Father of the True Lord." There was an outer letter tube, which was made of wood and covered with white silk, which was exquisitely beautiful. Pang Tianshou's report to the Pope had the character "Respectfully" on the front, with a square pearl seal, the seal text of which was "Seal of the General Governor of Brave Guards". The report was written on red folded paper. In order to express his gratitude for being baptized by the Jesuits, Pang Gong specially dedicated a silver plate to the tomb of St. Ignatius, engraved with Chinese and Latin.</p>
<p>The letters to Rome were written and completed, and then, during Mass, Pang Tianshou respectfully presented them to Father Bu. In November 1650, Father Bu and the two youths left Zhaoqing and went up the river to Macau. After Father Bu arrived in Macau, he handled all the envoy procedures. Unexpectedly, the Portuguese government in Macau raised many obstacles, believing that the Ming Dynasty's isolated regime could not last long, and that the Qing Dynasty would be unfavorable to itself in the future. However, Father Bu was able to depart on January 1, 1651. He arrived in Goa in May of the same year. The Portuguese government in Goa added even more obstacles to Father Bu, refusing to let him go. After half a year of negotiations, he could not get anywhere. Father Bu then abandoned his plan to sail and secretly traveled by land, through India, Persia, Armenia, Asia Minor, and reached Smyrna. He changed to a Venetian ship and arrived in Venice in early December 1652. The Venetian Republican government forbade Father Bu from entering the country. After mediation by the French envoy to Venice, he was allowed to enter, and he was treated favorably by the Senate. The Venetian government received Father Bu with the etiquette of a Chinese envoy, and Mr. Shen was his aide-de-camp. This can be said to be an international exchange between the Chinese court and the European Republic of Venice. The General of the Society of Jesus in Rome was quite displeased when he heard that Father Bu, as a member of the Society, was serving as this envoy. After Father Bu reported the details, he was allowed to enter Rome in a private capacity. Unexpectedly, after Father Bu arrived in Rome in 1653, some members of the clergy who were hostile to Father Bu claimed that he was impersonating an envoy and sneaking into Rome, and that the position of envoy was purely a fabrication of the Society of Jesus. Therefore, many difficulties arose regarding Father Bu's personal qualifications and the envoy's mission. The Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith met three times, and only resolved that the Pope could reply to the Ming Empress Dowager's national letter. While these trivial matters were happening, Pope Innocent X passed away in 1655, and the new Pope Alexander VII took office. Therefore, the Pope's reply was only issued on December 18, 1655, a total of two letters, one to the Empress Dowager and one to Pang Tianshou.</p>
<p>After obtaining the reply letter, Father Bu went to Lisbon, Portugal, and boarded a ship to return to China on March 30, 1656. Eight other members of the Society accompanied him, including Fathers Bai Yingli and Lu Zhiman. He arrived in Goa on November 6 of the same year. At that time, the Dutch blockaded Goa, and the members of the Society dispersed. Father Bu endured many hardships and arrived in Siam in early 1658. He planned to go to Macau, but because the Qing Dynasty had already taken over China, he could not go. He changed to a Chinese ship, sailed by a Dutchman, and arrived in Hanoi, Annam, in June. He waited until February 16, 1659, to set up a French Guangxi, but the Manchu army guarded it strictly, and he could not take a step forward. At this time, Father Bu was mentally and physically exhausted, and eventually fell ill. He died on August 22, 1659, on the border between Hanoi and Guangxi. His companion Shen Ande buried him and erected a stone tablet and a cross. Mr. Shen then fled into the mountains to avoid the Manchu Qing's pursuit, and the Pope's reply letter that Father Bu brought back could not be presented to the Ming court.</p>
<p>In the many years since Father Bu left China and returned to China, many changes had taken place in China. Father Qu Ande followed Yongli as he fled east and west, without a day of peace. One day, while taking a boat to avoid the Manchu army's pursuit, he was unfortunately captured. The Manchus questioned him in detail. Father Qu made the sign of the cross and recited the phrase, "By the holy cross, save us from our enemies" in response. Two Manchus then split his head with an ax, also in the shape of a cross, dividing it into four pieces. Another said that Father Qu followed Yongli and was captured by the Qing soldiers in a certain river in Guangxi, put to death, and his body was thrown into the river. It is also said that Father Qu was killed by the Qing soldiers, and Pang Tianshou buried him with due rites. As for the year of his death, there are different opinions, one saying it was in 1663, another saying it was in 1662, or 1658.</p>
<p>Pang Tianchou, who was loyal to Yongli, also died before Father Bu. At the time of his death, there was no priest by his side to administer the sacraments, but he was zealous in serving the Lord during his life and died peacefully. As for the year of his death, some say it was in 1658, others say it was in 16855, or 16 years, with different legends.</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager passed away in May after Father Bu set off, on May 10, 1651. The "Xiaodian Chronicle" says: In the fourth month of Yongli's fifth year, the Ming Empress Dowager died in Tianzhou, and was buried in Nanning in May, with the posthumous title of "Empress Xiaozhuang Yikang". However, Western history says that the Empress Dowager was captured from Burma by Wu Sangui and died in Yunnan in 1662. After her death, Yongli did not allow any non-religious rites to be held.</p>
<p>The last years of Emperor Yongli were even more tragic. The emperor went to Guangxi, then Yunnan, then Burma. The King of Burma greeted him with four boats and sent him to the capital city of Ava, where he lived for one year and six months. More than 1,500 of his entourage were lost. In the twelfth month of Yongli's fifteenth year, the Ming traitor General Wu Sangui went deep into the city of Ava. The King of Burma was terrified and hastily presented Yongli and his royal family to the army. In the fourth month of the following year, Yongli was killed in Yunnan. His son, Duke Si Changding, was fifteen years old at the time, and was killed at the same time. Empress Ma, Maria, and Empress Wang, Anna, and several other palace women were sent to Beijing, where they lived in separate palaces and were forbidden to go out, but the treatment was still good. However, the Ming Empresses and others were not allowed to see the priests in Beijing or receive the sacraments. Fortunately, some female Catholic friends went to inquire and comfort them with religious principles, which was also a consolation in the midst of suffering. The above is all recorded in Western history.</p>
<p>Recently, P. Schrestter, a priest in Nanlong, Guizhou, published an article in the Bulletin Catholique de Peking, 1915, PP, 266.267, stating that the tombs of Yongli and his son were discovered in Nanlong County in 1915. This tomb had been excavated by rebel soldiers before 1850 to steal treasures, but nothing was found. Now there are only two piles of soil, and no one can suspect that they are imperial tombs.</p>
<p>The "Xiaodian Chronicle" vividly describes Wu Sangui's capture and killing of Yongli. The last days of the King of Gui were extremely tragic. At this point, the Ming Dynasty's isolated regime came to an end.</p>

<h3>First Batch of Citizen Certificates Available This Week</h3>
<p>After the Public Concession Police Department's Baojia Department abolished the office that specialized in handling the exchange of citizen certificates, the application forms that had been sent to the department, along with the completed citizen certificates, have been sent back to the various police stations' Baojia departments for direct completion and issuance. The first batch of seven or eight thousand certificates can be issued by the original applying police station next week. The application forms for the Laoza District are also being collected, so the issuance of citizen certificates can be accelerated and issued continuously.</p>
<p>Return Home Certificate</p>
<p>The Return Home Special Pass Office of the Public Works Department on Jiangxi Road is continuing to issue return home certificates. Other sub-offices are also accepting applications as usual. Various Shanghai hometown associations and travel agencies are also entrusted to act as agents for issuing certificates. The total number issued daily is around 10,000, which is quite a large number.</p>
<p>Temporary Certificate</p>
<p>The Temporary Pass Office also issues mixed certificates. The number of applicants is even greater, because in addition to being able to use the certificate to pass through the surrounding areas of Shanghai to return home, it can also be used to return to Shanghai. Because the number of people is too crowded, the certificate issuing office issues them in several batches each day to alleviate the excessive congestion.</p>
<h3>Allied Banks Allow Withdrawal of Deposits: Most Have Not Withdrawn</h3>
<p>After several Allied banks in this port have successively resumed withdrawals and deposits, there are still many depositors who have not gone to their relevant banks to withdraw the funds they are allowed to withdraw. For example, the British-owned Mercantile Bank of India recently issued a formal announcement urging depositors who have not yet withdrawn funds to do so as soon as possible. According to the Mercantile Bank of India, it has started processing the first withdrawal of 2,000 yuan from the 4th of this month. Neutral country depositors can withdraw all at once, while Allied country depositors are limited to withdrawing 500 yuan per week until the withdrawal is complete. According to inquiries made by reporters to Chase Bank yesterday, the bank has started processing three withdrawals from the 15th of this month, and many depositors with funds available for withdrawal have not gone to the bank to withdraw them. As for the amount of the bank's three withdrawals, it is 10% of the balance after deducting 2,000 yuan from the balance on December 6 last year. It is heard that the phenomenon of depositors withdrawing money has not been crowded in the past week. In addition, HSBC, Mercantile Bank, and Citibank are still continuing to pay their third batch of withdrawals. The withdrawal percentage is 25% for HSBC and 30% for Mercantile Bank and Citibank.</p>
<h3>Cotton Merchant Jumps to His Death</h3>

He was seriously injured and died at Tongren Hospital.</p>
<h3>The New Bureau of Works Organization for Solving All Problems (6) 3. Rent Dispute Mediation Committee</h3>
<p>Another Proclamation</p>
<p>On March 28th, the Bureau issued another important proclamation. It stated that landlords may not force tenants who are unable to pay rent due to financial difficulties to move out without the consent of the Mediation Committee. One particularly important point is that all rent increases prior to further notice will not be effective unless approved by the Committee.</p>
<p>Since the Mediation Committee was established in mid-January, it has proven its benefit to society. In total, there have been seventy-four cases. Tenants accounted for forty-one cases, and landlords only thirty-three. Of these, fifty-three have been resolved. Twenty-five cases were settled, seven withdrawn, and twenty were not accepted. Twenty-one cases are currently still pending.</p>
<p>The actual handling procedure of such cases will be briefly explained by a member of the Committee specializing in legal affairs as follows: After receiving a complaint, the Committee forwards a copy to the other party and requires them to respond within three days. Upon receiving the response, a Bureau staff member convenes both parties to try to mediate a settlement. This is just a conversation to find out the real cause of their dispute. In eight out of ten cases, it is only about minor matters, and the matter is thus peacefully resolved.</p>
<p>"If a settlement is impossible," said the legal affairs member, "we try to get them to sign a letter of authorization, stating that they agree to submit the case to us for mediation and abide by our judgment. After the letter of authorization is signed, the case is presented to the entire Committee, awaiting its decision."</p>
<p>"Deepest Apologies"</p>
<p>"So, if the landlord and tenant are unwilling to sign a letter of authorization?" he continued, "we tell them we deeply apologize, but we are powerless… In other words, we cannot usurp the authority of the court. This situation is rare."</p>
<p>"In a few cases, when they come to see us, the case has already been, or will be, heard by the court, and the Mediation Committee is powerless to intervene," said the Committee member. "Moreover, both parties must agree to our handling of the matter. Once a judgment is made by the Committee, it will undoubtedly be supported by any court."</p>
<p>The Mediation Committee strives to be cautious, so as not to favor either party. There is no fairer or more reasonable method than this. Regarding the handling of rental issues, the Committee's usual standard is to allow landlords to double the rent based on the assessed value in 1937.</p>
<p>Here is an example</p>
<p>Here is an example of many cases. A landlord received a monthly rent of 381 yuan from his tenant, which included the provision of heating and hot water. After the lease expired, the rent remained unchanged, but the landlord demanded an additional 50 yuan for hot water. The tenant objected, so the matter was brought to the Mediation Committee. The Committee studied the case and found that the assessed rent for the premises in 1937 was only 129.65 yuan. Therefore, not only did the Committee disapprove of the landlord's request for additional hot water fees, but it also decided to reduce the rent to 300 yuan. The landlord had no choice but to comply.</p>
<p>One thing is very interesting: most of the cases are Chinese. They are very willing to come to the Mediation Committee. The court also prefers them to do so. Therefore, they are constantly flocking to the Bureau of Works Rent Dispute Mediation Committee, landlords and tenants, owners and renters, two by two… They all come out smiling slightly. It is a pity that not everything in life can be resolved so amicably.</p>
<h3>Speculators Are Stirring Up Trouble; French Authorities Decide to Punish Severely; Current Living Situation is Extremely Difficult; Determined to Do Everything Possible for the Welfare of the Citizens</h3>
<p>In recent months, the French Municipal Police Department, in order to protect the public, has taken extremely severe measures against speculation, manipulation, and excessive profits. If these indispensable measures are not strictly enforced, the current difficult living situation (difficulty in purchasing currency and food, lack of ships, etc.), which is already difficult to control, will be even more unimaginable.</p>
<p>Determination to Cope with Difficult Times</p>
<p>Countless speculators, due to the severe punishments, have lost the illegal profits they had planned to obtain, and are now stirring up trouble, using various improper methods to go against the police authorities. In fact, they are wasting their time. The French Municipal Police Department is determined to continue to severely punish acts detrimental to the public without懈怠. In the past, the city's living conditions were better than other cities similarly affected by the war because of the cooperation of various authorities in coping with difficult times. These jointly adopted measures should naturally be continued. In the past six months, the French Concession Police Department has been using its full strength to seek welfare for the residents of the city in response to the needs of the Concession and the urgent demands of the Japanese authorities, etc. In addition to efforts to reduce criminal cases, such as requisitioning necessities, registering all resources in the Concession, and investigating household registration, there is no end to it.</p>
<p>Police Extortion Can Be Reported</p>
<p>Recently, it is planning to organize Baojia, organize civilian police groups, issue 600,000 ID cards, and cooperate with other authorities to improve the distribution of rice, so as to avoid queuing and crowding in front of rice shops. The staff of the department are doing their best to cope with the difficult work. In the above process, some people inevitably impersonate detectives to engage in extortion, but those people are arrested and tried. Moreover, events of abuse of power also occur from time to time, but if this matter is formally reported to the detective authorities, and after investigation, it is found to be true, severe punishments are quickly given. The detective department has always adopted this measure, and now it continues to do so tirelessly. This can be guaranteed to the public by the French Consul-General Faber. The duties of the detectives and patrolmen of the detective department are originally boring and tasteless. For the need to maintain law and order, the actions of the detective department are sometimes regarded as unpleasant on the surface, but the people must know that the personnel of the detective department from top to bottom all take protecting the people as their own responsibility, and everyone gives their lives to achieve this goal. This situation has been common in the past few years.</p>
<h3>Price Limits on Food in the French Concession (May 23rd to May 27th)</h3>

<h3>Changshan Steamer Carries a Batch of Coffins to Ningbo</h3>
<p>The matter of transferring the coffins of fellow villagers back to their hometowns, handled by the Siming Public Association Guohua Funeral Home, has been in preparation for many days. At the beginning of the month, an advertisement was published in the newspaper to inform all fellow villagers. People from various counties under Ningbo who wish to transfer their coffins back to their hometowns can request registration from the Guohua Funeral Home or the Siming Public Association. In the past two weeks, the number of registrants has been quite crowded. It is now reported that it has been decided to entrust the Changshan steamer to carry the first batch on the 27th of this month. It is reported that there are 30 coffins. The transportation cost is reported to be 26 yuan in Japanese military notes for water freight and 100 yuan for other loading and unloading labor. Also, the Siming Public Association's summer　affairs meeting resolved to装运 500 coffins of long-term赊材 back to their hometowns for burial. According to the person in charge of the association, the date of装运 is still difficult to determine at present, and its nature is fundamentally different from the运柩返籍 handled by the association together with the Guohua Funeral Home.骸 Those who are selected from the institute will免费运籍安葬 long-term赊材, purely to help poor fellow villagers.</p>

The woodcuts are divided into works by ancient sculptors, modern woodcuts, and practical woodcuts. There are so many beautiful things that one can't take them all in. Among them, the classical paintings mostly focus on religious themes, such as the birth of Christ, Jesus' first visit to the temple, Christ and his parents. Modern paintings reflect the characteristics of urban life and the German national character quite obviously. The images of great men such as Hitler and other ancient German great men such as Martin Luther and Goethe are all lifelike and full of spirit. Other landscapes, flowers and birds are mostly harmonious in color and particularly vivid and beautiful. Although it rained yesterday, art lovers still came in an endless stream to visit, hoping not to miss this opportunity to appreciate German art.</p>

<h3>Disagreement Between the Combatant Nations Regarding the Exchange of Evacuees; The US and UK Believe That Neutral Vessels Should be Used; Vessels of Combatant Nations Should Not Assume This Responsibility</h3>
<p>In recent days, it has been widely rumored among the British and American expatriate communities that the reason for the delay in making a concrete decision on the exchange of nationals between Japan and the United Kingdom and the United States is that the relevant authorities have not yet reached a consensus on the issue of the nationality of the transporting vessels.</p>
<p>The Vessel Issue</p>
<p>The US and UK governments believe that the evacuation of British and American officials and ordinary people from Japan and its occupied territories to designated exchange locations should be carried out by neutral vessels, while the Japanese authorities have announced that British and American officials and civilians will be transported to East Africa by a total of four vessels, including the Italian postal ship Conte Verde and the Japanese postal ships Tatsuta Maru, Asama Maru, and Kamakura Maru. This point may not be agreed to by the British and American authorities. The negotiations between the relevant authorities are now apparently focused on this point. According to a British official currently staying in Shanghai, "Since the negotiation on the exchange of nationals, the importance of the issue of neutral vessels has never been greater than it is today." According to some people, if such a point of contention cannot be resolved satisfactorily, the evacuation of nationals cannot be expected to proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>Conflicting Opinions</p>
<p>The negotiations between Japan and the United Kingdom and the United States for the exchange and evacuation of officials and civilians have been ongoing for two months. When it was first announced, it was said that two Brazilian ships would sail from South America to Shanghai to welcome and transport the nationals of the Allied countries back to their countries. Soon, the Japanese authorities announced that the exchange of officials and civilians would take place in Magus, East Africa. Later, it was revealed that the officials and civilians of the Allied countries would be transported from here separately by Italian and Japanese postal ships. However, the spokesman of the Japanese Embassy stated a few days ago that this matter cannot be determined until the last minute, and the Italian authorities did not confirm that the Conte Verde would be one of the dedicated ships for the evacuation of nationals. Unexpectedly, today, the issue of the nationality of the ships has caused a clash of opinions, which makes the prospects for the evacuation of nationals less optimistic.</p>
<h3>Five Religions Lecture Series; Five Elements Research Class</h3>

<h3>The Yoyoyo Nursery; The Fundraising Extension Ends; Continuing to Provide Vegetable and Nutrition Charts</h3>
<p>The Yoyoyo Nursery was reorganized from the Gonghua Children's Shelter, and it has 250 children, all of whom are难童 who have been displaced by the war,孤苦无依 and whose situation is particularly pitiful. Last month, it held a fundraising campaign, which was originally scheduled for one month. The achievements have exceeded 100,000. It has now been decided to extend the period to June 6th. In addition, the Production Department of the院 has specially set up a rattan craft sales outlet at No. 544 Xinzha Road (west end of Chengdu Road). All kinds of籐制器具 are available, and a 10% discount is offered at the beginning of the opening. The machine grinding department grinds all kinds of miscellaneous grains and medicinal materials on behalf of others at a low cost. It is hoped that people with a heart in the society will give their support. The 給養股, in order to serve the society, has specially compiled a vegetable nutrition chart based on the book "What We Eat" published by the Chinese Medical Association, which can be used as a reference for home-cooked dishes. The first edition of several thousand copies has been claimed. Now, dozens of copies have been reprinted. Those who wish to claim a copy can attach a four-point postage stamp and send a letter to No. 9, Lane 110, Kaifeng Road (telephone 43176) to claim it.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Children's Welfare Association; Raising Educational Expenses; Target of 200,000 Legal Tender</h3>
<p>The Chinese Children's Welfare Association in this city has always taken promoting children's happiness as its mission. Since the outbreak of the war, people have been displaced, and the old and young have been separated. The association's responsibilities lie in striving for relief work. It has successively sheltered nearly 10,000难童. There are now two locations: the慈幼敎養院 and the难童收容所, which shelter a total of more than 450孤苦 children who have nowhere to go. At this time when everything is expensive, the funding has increased several times. Although it is trying to be thrifty, it is often insufficient. Therefore, the association's executive committee has decided to hold a fundraising campaign for educational expenses from June 1st to June 31st, with a target of one hundred thousand yuan in legal tender. The幹事部 is now actively preparing for it. It is deeply believed that people from all walks of life will definitely踊跃捐输 at that time, so that the association's work will not be abandoned due to lack of funding. Then the benefit to children will be boundless.</p>

<h3>Struggling for Survival; The Jewish Street Market; Determined, Calm, Alert, and Adventurous Are Their Unique Characteristics</h3>
<p>Special Report by This Newspaper</p>
<p>I remember someone once telling a joke that mocked the Jews: "A certain wealthy man behaved lavishly and spent money like dirt. Once, while traveling in the Jewish country, he unfortunately fell ill. According to the doctor, he had to receive a blood transfusion to be saved. This wealthy man was willing to pay a thousand gold in exchange for someone to sell his blood. At that time, a Jew responded and was willing to transfuse his precious blood to the wealthy man and get this reward. Unexpectedly, after the wealthy patient received the blood transfusion, he completely went back on his word and only agreed to pay half of the reward. Later, the wealthy man bought blood from the Jew several times, but the price he was willing to pay decreased each time…"</p>
<p>Skilled in Financial Management</p>
<p>The storyteller asked here, "Why did a wealthy man who spends money like dirt suddenly become so stingy?" The answer is that this wealthy man had a lot of Jewish blood in his body. The Jews are known for their stinginess, and the wealthy man was poisoned by the stinginess of the Jews. Although this joke is inevitably too exaggerated and too mocking, it partially shows a characteristic of the Jewish people. The Jews are not only stingy but also extremely diligent and thrifty. In fact, stinginess and thrift are twins. Stingy people must be diligent and thrifty, and diligent and thrifty people must also be stingy. Because of this, the Jews are good at financial management and business. Isn't Hartung, whose estate dispute still has no hope of being resolved, a Jew?</p>
<p>However, hidden behind the Jewish people's diligent, thrifty, and stingy national character are their determined, calm, and alert ability to adapt to and create environments. You must know that the Jews now have no motherland. Their footprints are all over the world, but they have the courage to take risks and be enterprising. No matter how dangerous the environment is, no matter how much they are bullied and persecuted, they always maintain their determination and perseverance to fight for the right to survive. This is why they can still achieve a considerable position in this world of survival of the fittest.</p>
<p>Penetrating Everywhere in Selling Goods</p>
<p>I'm afraid no one would firmly believe that there are tens of thousands of Jews in Shanghai! In recent years, batches of Jewish people have been expelled from Europe and came to this international city of Shanghai as displaced refugees. They originally lived in countries such as Germany and Austria, developing their inherent national character, occupying a very priority position in the financial, industrial, and commercial circles, and even in the political circles. Unfortunately, they suffered from the jealousy of the local government, suffering磨难 and devastation, until their families were destroyed and they were left with nothing, and they were expelled from the country. After arriving in Shanghai empty-handed and wandering, they settled down in the Hongkou area,重新张起 the banner of survival, and embarked on a difficult road of struggle.</p>
<p>I have just said that the Jews are good at business, so their livelihood skills cannot escape the scope of commerce. In the office buildings in the central area, there are often Jews coming in and out. They are salesmen of goods, carrying a briefcase or basket, selling door to door. They can indeed grasp the threshold of doing business, softly and kindly asking people to buy this and buy that. They understand the customers' minds very well, but they also maintain their dignity. Tidy clothes and a particularly kind attitude often leave a deep impression. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Jewish Merchants</h3>
<p>Jews are known for their business acumen in the world. After the people流亡 to Shanghai, they worked hard and struggled hard, and finally gained a foothold. The picture on the right (top) is the Mazhong Road market in Zhongxin District (bottom) The demeanor during the transaction.</p>

<h3>Opportunity to Buy is Profit; Yarn and Cloth Jump Horizontally</h3>
<p>— Quan</p>
<p>Last week, the yarn and cloth market was completely chaotic due to the repeated listing of Central Reserve Certificates and the exchange of various rumors. At the end of the week, the market atmosphere was like惊浪骇涛, and the changes were incomprehensible. In addition, eight yarn factories in Shanghai, including Shenxin　Nine, Yongan Third, Baofeng, Anda, and Hefeng, were implementing the return of the factories, which made people even more excited. The 20-count Double Horse factory单 broke through three major levels of 7,000, 8,000, and 9,000 yuan from the previous week's 6,000 yuan. The现货 of more than 1,000 that was轧开 daily was gradually趋轧拢 due to the influence of the factory single that could be车货, so the price continued to rise. The highest price for 10-count Double Horse factory单 was actually 9,100 yuan, and the现货 was 9,400 yuan. Coarse and fine cloth also unanimously set new highs. 16-pound Double Elephant coarse cloth was 370 yuan, and 12-pound Earth fine cloth was 330 yuan,剏为 a peak that has never been seen before.</p>
<p>On Monday, due to the inverted sales盘 in the inland, many people wanted to吐售, and Double Horse once fell back, down to 5,870 yuan; but the factory cloth was 东疋, jumping horizontally and rising on its own. After Tuesday, the幻变 became even greater; high prices were emerging one after another, and the涨风 often occurred after the close. Taking the cotton yarn factory单 as an example: the closing price on Tuesday was 6,120 yuan, but after the close, it rose again to 6,400 yuan; the closing price on Wednesday was 6,330 yuan, but after the close, it did again to 6,700 yuan; again, the closing price on Thursday was 7,200 yuan, but outside the塲, it did again to 7,820 yuan; even the closing price on Friday was 8,000 yuan, but after the close,父涨 to 8,700 yuan. Such a situation is simply罕覩. The reason is that it is actually a 反动 of the financial stimulus. At the weekend, the closing price of 10-count Double Horse factory单 was 8,850 yuan, a sharp increase of 2,760 yuan from the previous week, and the现货 was 9,430 yuan, an increase of 1,830 yuan. 20-count Double Earth was 9,200 yuan, an increase of 2,050 yuan; 32-count Jin Bao Xing was 13,200 yuan, an increase of 2,250 yuan. 16-pound Double Elephant coarse cloth was 370 yuan, an increase of 90 yuan; 12-pound Earth coarse cloth was 330 yuan, an increase of 93 yuan.</p>
<p>At present, the actual sale of yarn and cloth is still停顿, and the retail business on this street is also limited due to the weak purchasing power. However, due to the continuous financial stimulus, it has caused a敏捷 反响. At present, people's hearts are showing a chaotic atmosphere due to the vestiges of last week's big上落. How will the幻变 be next week? It should still be左右 by the震荡 of the financial market.</p>
<h3>Ultimately Full of Concerns: Foreign Stocks Still Rising</h3>
<p>— Sang</p>
<p>During the past week, the foreign stock market initially showed signs of stability mixed with fatigue, making it difficult to rally. Supply and demand were normal. However, after Wednesday, there was a sudden and sharp surge. This upward trend continued. It seems that attention was initially focused on hoarding cotton yarn and military scrip. Later, realizing that their market prices had risen excessively, people suddenly turned their attention to foreign stocks that had not yet been driven up. They all rushed to buy them, a phenomenon of flocking. The total trading volume for the week increased rapidly along with the rising prices, reaching 358,110 shares in five days. (According to daily reports from the Chinese Brokers Association.) The last day saw the highest volume, with 138,275 shares, breaking the record since December 8th of last year. This was likely also caused by the recent currency system changes.</p>
<p>Among various stocks, textile stocks continued to be the most traded and active. Ewo Cotton Mill initially fluctuated between $38.50 and $39.50, but by Wednesday, it suddenly soared to $43.75, eventually closing at $43, a rise of $3.50. Bank of China saw a low of $23.75, then surged all the way to $30.50, a rise of $6.25. Sincere Cotton Mill rose from $18.50 to $26.20, a rise of $7.70. These were all driven by the surge in yarn prices. Small-cap stocks saw weaker gains. Paper stocks rose $10 to $12.10. Shanghai Woolens rose only $0.30 to $17. Rubber stocks saw relatively active trading, with Dunlop, Galongdan, and Tanah Merah seeing the most transactions. However, the price increases were minimal, rising by about $0.36. Among industrial stocks, only Yap Guang saw a significant increase of $6.25; the others saw limited gains. Daily trading volume was low. Financial stocks were even more neglected, with only Sino-Foreign slightly improving. Among public utility stocks, only trams saw active trading; the rest lacked sellers.</p>
<p>Considering the ever-increasing commodity prices, foreign stock trading is no longer determined by safety or business conditions. Instead, it is based solely on the asset value for valuation. However, observing the trend of large amounts of speculative funds, it seems that they have not yet concentrated here. Therefore, the upward pressure cannot compete with other assets. This is ultimately due to the many concerns about the future.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Soar: Financial Stimulus Frequent, Growth Breaks Records</h3>
<p>The Chinese stock market experienced a dramatic change due to financial upheaval. Intense buying pressure and soaring prices created a new situation where there was demand for stocks but no supply. This phenomenon was unprecedented and could be seen as a reflection of public panic, rather than enthusiastic investment.</p>
<p>Looking at the stock market over the past week, the beginning of the week continued the upward trend from the previous week, with prices tightening step by step. Since the listing of old and new legal tender on Wednesday, after three successive reductions from 77, the upward trend suddenly intensified. Buyers seeking to enter the market rose like wind and clouds. The tense mood was indescribable. China Underwear, a department store stock, rose from $25.50 to $34.50. Wing On Company rose from $64.50 to $72.50. The Sincere Company rose from $74 to $80. New pharmaceutical stocks were particularly prominent. New Asia New Stock broke through the $40 mark on Thursday and soared to $44.50. Sino-French New Stock initially showed stability, then suddenly surged to a high of $76, with strong momentum still present. Sheng Hua Preference saw a sudden surge, rising from $22.50 to approximately $31. Sino-British Dispensary had already risen to $190 per share. Other stocks such as Wu Zhou, Min Yi, and Xin Yi were all very popular. Textile stocks had limited shares, and the upward trend was even stronger after being stimulated by the market. Da Sheng Mill rose from $55 to $100. The Third Mill rose $45. Da Feng Dyeing and Weaving rose $55. Among industrial stocks, cultural stocks saw the strongest gains. World New Stock even reached a peak of $110. Commercial Press and China Book Company also rose frequently. Art Forest Color Printing rose from $85 to $107.50. The rise of Great China Match was not much because its face value had already exceeded six times. New Capital Hotel initially rose, then remained stable. Public utility stocks, such as China Electricity, broke through the $20 mark and stood between $21 and $21.50. Zhabei Water and Electricity was also approaching $20.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to this week's market, if the financial trend does not stabilize from the volatility, then the continued rise of the stock market is almost certain. However, it is worth noting that after last week's surge, sellers have become scarce, and buyers have adopted a wait-and-see attitude due to the high prices. Therefore, it is predicted that the trading volume this week will be difficult to match last week's prosperity.</p>
<h3>Favorable Environmental Changes: Bond Market Improves</h3>
<p>— Ling</p>
<p>The public bond market saw heated battles between buyers and sellers, with extremely drastic changes. The sudden shift from limit down to limit up was a rare feat not seen since December 8th of last year. Although sellers dumped a lot of bonds at the end, the buyers relied on their unlimited capital to absorb them without releasing them. With the assistance of the environment, they were able to recover from a near-death situation, eventually rising by $0.90 to $4.20. The total trading volume for the week was strong, totaling approximately 13 million dollars.</p>
<p>On Monday and Tuesday, the entire situation was almost controlled by the buyers. Prices fell drastically wherever their influence reached. Silk Grade C, followed by Grade B, first hit the limit down. At this time, the bonds were worth only 46% to 90% of their face value, and the future seemed bleak. However, even in this turmoil, the financial community continued to provide support. They worked even harder as the environment became more dangerous. As a result of their efforts, they achieved considerable success and gained the support of the Northern financial community and the yarn and flower industry. Therefore, on Wednesday, they quickly turned into limit up. Although there were minor twists and turns in the following three days, the sellers were unable to shift the situation. People's hearts were happy and prosperous. Stimulated by changes in the banking system and soaring commodity prices, the foundation became more stable.</p>
<p>It has been found that the number of bonds sold by sellers last week was still very large; however, they were all absorbed by the buyers. Their strength is immeasurable by ordinary standards. Recently, the extremely high discount rate for call loans has caused public bonds to be priced based on call loans. Therefore, they have been devalued by approximately 90% according to the discount rate. At a time when a large amount of cash is being swept away by speculators, call loan positions are feeling a lack of outlets. Therefore, purchasing public bonds has become a win-win situation. As a result, even in the midst of currency turmoil, the bond market has been able to maintain a firm position, demonstrating that its foundation is solid and cannot be shaken by external forces. It is generally predicted that public bonds will be the final destination for speculative funds.</p>
<h3>Rumors Turn Out to Be True: Currency Market Takes Flight</h3>
<p>The foreign currency market experienced a significant surge, just as speculators had hoped. The intensity of the trend not only exceeded the expectations of ordinary speculators but also created a record of unprecedented change. The rumor of raising the reserve exchange rate, which had been circulating in the market for a month, was finally realized. It rose day by day, becoming more and more intense. As a result, buying interest from all parties also became stronger and stronger as the price rose. Military scrip rose from $7.45 at the beginning of the week to $8.15. The exchange rate change was realized on Friday (May 20), but it was less than expected, so it fell back to $7.77.</p>

<h3>Do Not Poison Your Children!</h3>
<p>— Yan Zheng</p>
<p>In a hospital waiting room, I saw a woman holding a child. The woman suffered from a severe venereal disease, and she walked with a limp. The child's face, hands, and feet were covered in sores.</p>
<p>The child was still sucking the woman's milk with his bright eyes!</p>
<p>Two or three kind-hearted patients dissuaded the woman, saying, "You are sick yourself, don't give him your milk! He is already nine months old. Can't you feed him a little porridge?"</p>
<p>The woman listened without agreeing or disagreeing, only saying that her disease was transmitted to her by her boss. She had given birth to four children herself, and they had all died soon after birth. This child was adopted from an orphanage. As she spoke, she fully displayed her "feminine virtue," without the slightest expression of resentment.</p>
<p>The child was still sucking the woman's milk with his bright eyes! ...</p>
<p>But such poisoning of children is obvious. On the other hand, the poisons that parents generally transmit to their children in spirit are more dangerous because they are often unconscious. In the current situation where parental authority still dominates most families, things like the above are common. Parents subjectively or subconsciously infect their children with their own old mental and behavioral problems, wanting their children to follow in their footsteps and imitate them in everything, when in fact they themselves were never good examples! We know that children have more "plasticity" than adults, so before they have grown up, they have been made to lose the soul of a "person"!</p>
<p>If we want children to grow up to be real people, I think we can only stop feeding them poisonous milk immediately. If there is no nutritious milk, then porridge will do!</p>
<p>Otherwise, if the necessary conditions for being a "person" are lost, it will be difficult to sustain life, let alone develop?</p>
<p>Nature</p>
<h3>Poison Gas Experts: Insects</h3>
<p>— Luo Wen</p>
<p>Before humans invented poison gas, insects were already using various kinds of poison gas. Some ants can spray strong "formic acid." If someone recklessly brings their face close to an ant nest, their skin will definitely burn. The strong breath often causes irritation of the nose. This is clearly the forerunner of modern mustard gas.</p>
<p>The best users of poison gas are beetles. Even the beautiful ladybug will emit a foul odor when treated roughly. But the most ingenious method is that of the one-third-inch-long, dark blue and red bombadier beetle, which emits a liquid in all directions. Once the liquid comes into contact with the air, it explodes slightly, turning into a foul-smelling blue gas. As a defense tool, it is extremely effective, allowing the tiny bombadier beetle to easily escape many large insects that try to prey on it.</p>
<p>Another beetle that can emit fierce poison gas is the fierce-looking rove beetle. This is a common shell beetle in the garden, which is naturally belligerent. Even if a cane touches it, it will attack it fiercely. First, it curls up its tail, and then emits a strong odor from the two yellow glands at the end of its tail.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a common insect in the garden that can emit an odor. That is the lacewing, which we can see flying weakly in the garden in the summer dusk. Its body is green and has a pair of pearl-like yellow eyes. When teased, it actually emits a foul odor that cannot be washed away even with soap and water.</p>
<p>Among insect larvae, the most skilled at emitting poison gas is the European swallowtail. When it is quietly feeding, it seems to be a gentle and beautiful insect. But when threatened by enemies, it immediately shrinks its head back, showing an extremely fierce "face." At the same time, it extends the two red lines at the end of its tail in a seemingly hateful manner. If this "psychological warfare" still cannot repel the enemy, then it will shoot out a very unpleasant acidic liquid.</p>

<h3>Night-Illuminating Shovel</h3>
<p>— Shen Xiong</p>
<p>During wartime, all work is accelerated, so it is often necessary to work at night. However, outdoor work at night is very inconvenient. You cannot see your fingers in front of your face. What can you do? The night-illuminating shovel was born to meet this need. There is a light head on the shovel, so you can see the target clearly whether you are working in the coal store or in the garden. The manufacturing method is to attach a flash lamp to the handle of the shovel with a clip. If a farmer's shovel or hoe has this device, you can still work as usual even after the sun has set. Cleaners or gardeners can also clear snow from the roads at night.</p>

<h3>Crying and Laughing Machine</h3>
<p>— Geng Bi</p>
<p>An American physicist has invented a mysterious machine that can emit certain special electrical waves. After people feel them, they will cry or laugh uncontrollably. It is planned to install this machine in theaters. When a comedy is being performed, it will broadcast happy electrical waves. After the audience's nerves receive this electrical wave, they will all laugh heartily for hours. If it is a tragedy, it will broadcast sad electrical waves, and the audience will weep bitterly, as if their parents had died. No matter how ordinary the plot is or how clumsy the actors' skills are, it can achieve extraordinary effects.</p>
<p>Some people predict that after the "crying and laughing machine" is released, the box office of theaters will be unimaginably successful, and at the same time, this machine will make the theater world shine.</p>
<p>I think this is impossible because when this machine is used, the audience's emotions are passive and unnatural. They laugh wildly (or cry loudly) as if their laughter acupoints have been pressed. They cannot appreciate the plot. As a result, it only makes their nerves overstimulated, and customers will definitely not patronize it.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat in Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(5) Reciprocal Retaliation</p>
<p>Cui Zhen said, "When I heard this, I immediately felt dizzy and disoriented, as if an arrow was piercing my heart. I fainted." Guo Fang said, "What happened to your cousin later?" Cui Zhen said, "I fainted, and I didn't know anything." Guo Fang felt ridiculous and said, "Cui Zhen, you should be patient and optimistic. I'm not helping you to say bad things about your uncle. He is simply a villain. Why get angry with a villain? If the Second Aunt here allows it, you can leave the countryside and come with me to live in Shanghai for a few days. Let your uncle know that Cui Zhen doesn't have to live in the countryside." Cui Zhen laughed, "Is someone like me worthy of going to Shanghai? Going to Shanghai, I'll be seen as a maidservant, that's for sure." Guo Fang said, "What are you talking about? Don't overestimate the people of Shanghai. Are all the women who live in Shanghai graceful and noble like young ladies or young mistresses? Even if they have some resemblance, Cui Zhen, you are not necessarily unlike them. Can you lose to them in terms of modern fashion? Can you lose to them in terms of beauty?"</p>
<p>Guo Fang conveniently complimented Cui Zhen a few times. Cui Zhen forgot her grief and anger and laughed, "It's not possible for me to go to Shanghai. These few days, I've been staying at Brother Cheng's house. Now that I think about it, it's not possible for me to leave Brother Cheng's house either. There are many things that the Second Aunt can't think of, He Ma can't think of, and Brother Cheng can't think of even more..." Guo Fang suddenly grasped Cui Zhen's hand and shook it a few times. Cui Zhen knew from Guo Fang's expression that he was going to say something unusual. Sure enough, Guo Fang smiled lightly and said, "I heard someone say that Cui Zhen came and won't leave again. Simply put, you are a member of the Ye family now. Because Mr. Ye is in mourning, it hasn't been announced yet. In the future, in the future, there will definitely be no problem, right?" (84)</p>
