<h3>馬島法軍退新陣地</h3>
<p>維希十四日海通社電</p>
<p>此間官方今日宣稱法軍在馬達加斯加之安波雪特拉迤北與英軍苦戰之後今已退守新陣地是役敵軍受創甚香</p>
<h3>各國政府的發言人（三）</h3>
<h3>英國的角色</h3>
<p>英國在戰前天在外交部執行新聞記者但發言人並不是一個重要角色據我們經騐所得我們知道有兩個人輪流負責執行記者他們執行記者的方法是輪流地說今天我沒有意見發表或者我恐怕不能夠告訴你</p>
<p>倍克先生(Mr.Peak)在記者羣中連英國記者在內人緣不甚好後來他以情報隨員身份跟隨新任駐美大使哈利法克斯爵士(Lord　Halifax)到華盛頓去</p>
<p>另一位發言人列資臺爾先生(Mr.Readsdale)卻是一個令人歡喜的傢伙雖然他時常像他的上司倍克先生一樣迫著要說我恐怕不能夠告訴你但是他的澡定的答語說得那麼和藹使記者們聽來似乎含義甚深似的</p>
<h3>遠東的發言人</h3>
<p>除了美國世界上沒有一處地方報紙的銷路像在日本那麼廣尤其是在東京所以我們便很容易了解日本政府之一向對報紙特別注重對外國報紙同樣注重之原因因此像其他各地一樣日本政府發言人的職務多是注意外國報紙其先發言人是外務省的官員在中日戰爭開頭三年中這種制度沒有變更直到一九四○年情報省設立之後發言人才由情報省官員擔任</p>
<p>頭一位發言人是石井他在大東亞戰爭將爆發時被調到曼谷日本大使館服務他的繼任人即現任的發言人是堀氏像石井一樣堀氏的特長是對於外國報紙的了解因戰爭的結果堀氏的招待記者會議規模變小了因為除了日德義三國的記者外參加的只有一個法國記者兩個蘇聯記者外國記者中佔最大多數的是德國記者共有十四人代表著德國各通訊社及各報館</p>
<p>堀氏的特長是他的對於時局的澈底的評論他的評論有頭有尾非常完全用不著刪削或增潤就可以當作細心寫作的政治論文因此軸心國常將他的評論當作政治論文刊出他在外交界服務的經騐和他前幾年在別處任發言人的經騐對他現在的職務有極大幫助從一九二四年到一九二八年堀氏是日本駐華盛頓大使館的秘書曾在短期間被調到青島南京上海之後一九三四年又被調到美國任洛杉磯的領事直到一九三七年為止一九三七年他赴青島任日本領事館及日本陸海軍當局聯合主國的執行記者會議的發言人自一九四零年十二月他在上海任日方發言人時起他才名聞於時後來他便調到現任職位——情報省宣傳部部長</p>
<p>自大東亞戰爭爆發之後情報省的重要必更形增加東京發出的新聞佔據了全世界報紙的主要篇幅尤其是日本政府將海陸空軍空前大勝的戰報連珠似的發出更使全球報紙注重東京來的新聞大東亞共榮圈一詞便是由日本發言人首先運用才傳達到世界各地的報章及公眾口中去的</p>
<p>和許多國家的情形相反日本是有幾個發言人的堀氏單單批評純粹政治的事件軍事方面另有陸軍部和海軍部的發言人這兩位發言人並不招待外國新聞記者只是經常地在無線電廣播有關軍事的評論因此外國記得經常地得聆他們的言論有時賣出氏也向國內用無線電廣播關於純粹政治事件的評論在日本以外的地方尤其是在上海和北京也有日本當局執行的記者會議</p>
<p>上海方面日本陸軍發言人是橫山中佐海軍發言人是鎌田大使館發言人是廣田日本方面任命這幾位傑出的人物來做發言人可見得日方對這問題的重視像堀氏一樣橫山中佐是在就任上海方面日陸軍發言人之後才名聞於時的他們三個發言人帶著些副發言人及幾位伶傻冒的翻譯官每週二次在華懋飯店執行中日德義法俄幾國的記者大家在熙和的氣氛中討論時事</p>
<p>日本政府始終採取言論自由政策因此一直等到中日戰事打了四年之後日本才開始編制新聞然而即使在太平洋戰爭發生之後新聞的檢查依然非常寬大尤其因為在東京的外國記者大半籍隸日本的同盟國所以日政府的態度更見得寬容（完）</p>

<h3>工部局限制肉價黑市繼續存在求過於供仍需高價購得豬肉最高價竟達十八元</h3>
<p>上海泰晤士報云公共租界各菜場攤販與肉店昨日（十三日）多已遵照工部局頒佈之最高零售限價出售牛羊肉惟豬肉販之買賣仍有極混亂之狀態存在如豬腿肉或腰肉每磅竟達十六元以至十八元工部局宣布之限價則為八元四角</p>
<p>欲購豬肉仍需高價</p>
<p>兩租界肉店及西摩路等菜場中數攤販確照限價出售小量豬肉然殊不足應居民之日常需求故多數主婦欲購豬肉不得不出每磅十六元至十八元之高價尤以虹口菜場為然該菜場之攤販絕無以十八元以下之價售豬肉者浜北之肉販謂彼等未能照工部局之限價出售各種豬肉蓋免虧折也彼等向宰牲場購豬一頭概照全重量計算然將豬宰割後重量頗多損失蓋豬頭及其他部份未能善價脫售為彌補此損失計不得不索較高之價云</p>
<p>求過於供弊端重重</p>
<p>據記者廣事調查所悉昨日倍開爾路菜場之豬肉售價最為合理係照編制價出售每人至多可購一斤然份量不足肉販獲利不貲顧客則無敢爭論者因其能購得少許豬肉已感幸運也福州路菜場之豬肉價每磅售十六元至十八元購者仍夥法租界方面情況殆亦如此許多人士認為豬肉價昂及黑市存在之主因厥為來貨匱乏</p>
<p>牛羊肉價編制見效</p>
<p>至於牛羊肉零售價雖僅昨日始加統制然已見良好結果兩租界物品編制課專家顯已緊密編制其供應與分配牛肉雖有限價仍有大量可獲得從較廉需求更殷故銷售亦速昨日午後曾有許多肉店不願照限價出售某數種牛肉然一般預料經物品編制課監察員查悉違章者而處以重罰後肉販自將嚴守限價也</p>

<h3>讀書容易喫飯難青年會開設學生食堂切盼同情者予以佽助</h3>
<p>目前學生吃飯所遭遇的困難卻是一艘普遍現象解決這個問題的辦法有二（一）普遍的開設經濟營養衛生的食堂（二）救濟一般經濟困難的學生上海男女青年會學生救濟委員會開設學生食堂及清寒學生膳食補助運動也就是為適應這種需要而發起的希望各界努力捐輸送款地點係八仙橋青年會或威海衛路六百三十八號一女青年會這里所登的便是感受切身痛苦者的呼聲青年會既肩承了解決學生喫飯問題的重傷我們大家分些擔子罷讓我們一致起來幫助青年會（編者）</p>
<h3>一客飯起碼三元</h3>
<p>同學們遇在一起時有時談起午膳問題來差不多大家都是皺著眉兒嘆一聲吃飯難</p>
<p>家離學校那麼遠假使要想放了午學急急忙忙的坐著電車趕回家來吃一頓中飯再急急忙忙的坐著電車上學校別提現在電車車價漲得多麼貴單就時間而論也已來不及了而且飯後趕路說起來還是有遠養生之道啦</p>
<p>不回家那末就在外邊吃頓中飯吧揀學校附近最經濟的店家吃客飯去嘿每客起碼三元一星期六餐一學期至少得須三四百元我們的學費每學期也不過二三百元呢</p>
<p>客飯既那末貴省點兒吃一碗陽春麺或買一隻麺包充充飢吧可是陽春麺淺淺的一碗吃了一碗每使人有再添一碗之感而麺包則又冷又硬吃下了肚眞想到那裹去喝碗熱茶才舒服結果陽春麺與麺包的價格與客飯相較雖未見得便宜到怎怎可是數月以後健康倒早已受到影響了</p>
<h3>外埠學生更困難</h3>
<p>僅在外面吃了一頓中膳同學已使他們感到如此的麻煩可是還有從外埠到上海來讀書的學生那才是再加上二三倍的麻煩也不止呢他們有的居住在祗供住宿不備膳食的學校裹有的與幾個同學合租一間房間膳食自理這才眞是糟糕試想想一清早起來生好風爐吃完早飯收拾碗筷然後挾了書包上學這是什麼味道而且這年頭米貴菜貴油貴鹽貴柴也貴這一來月底結算每個人每月至少怕不也要二三百元麼</p>
<h3>影響到青年健康</h3>
<p>在一般學校裹平日生活富裕的同學固然很多然而環境困難的同學確也不少課餘之暇七八個同學坐攏來拉扯瞎談從世界大事談起直到身邊瑣事為止話鋒一轉轉到各人的康健問題上</p>
<p>甲說：我這幾天胃痛大發這是半年來哨硬麺包的好結果</p>
<p>乙說：可不是嗎我的胃病也越來越深了老是鬧肚子餓餓了就痛痛了就吃吃又吃不了多少可是隔不了多少時候立刻又要鬧餓痛吃的三部曲了</p>
<p>丙說：我晚上失眠神經抽痛四肢乏力而且腰背竣酸醫生說是缺乏營養叫我以後要多多的注意食物成份可是那裹來的錢哪</p>
<p>丁說：我每天得生風爐買菜燒飯洗衣服這些事眞累死我了還有什麼心思來念書呀一到晚上天知道我是多麼的疲倦</p>
<h3>需要健全的身體</h3>
<p>真的假使我們來一下實地調查同學的康健問題那眞會使人吃驚的胃痛肺病是同學們並不少見的疾病疲乏營養不足情緒煩躁是同學們普遍販情況十個同學之間要找出二三個完全夠得上康健標準的已經可算是難得可貴了</p>
<p>學業是事業之先然而欲求學業能成功必須先有健全的身體多愁多病的白面書生已不為現代社會所歡迎了我們需要生龍活虎般的壯健青年做我們未來社會的主人翁然則我們該如何來關心未來主人翁的學生期間的體格康健呀</p>
<h3>理想的食堂實現</h3>
<p>以前許多同學們老是在幻想著最好有這麼一家理想的飯店價格經濟食物清潔配料合乎營養原理而地點又最好離學校不遠那末離家遠的同學固不必在一個半鐘點之內慌慌張張的趕回家來用中膳或吞陽春麺啃硬麺包充飢而致胃病緾身就是自理膳食的外埠同學也不必將老半天的大好光陰消耗在生風爐燒飯菜之類的瑣事上面了</p>
<p>理想有時是眞能成為事實的可不是嗎青年會開辦的學生食堂就應這個需要而興起的經濟清潔合乎營養這一切的特點到現在為止我們還沒有在第二家發現過當然學生食堂還沒達到百分之百的理想不過在這艱難的時候居然有這樣一個食堂實在是同學的欣幸更希望著社會上的熱心人士再多多的注意這問題贊助這個濟助學生膳食的運動</p>

<h3>防空清空習之夜</h3>
<p>— 吳絮</p>
<p>防空開始放小燈光外面有著緊張的呼喊聲</p>
<p>我們把窗戶遮上重重的黑帷燈罩也穿上了一件黑大氅四壁晦暗燈光集中在房間的中央</p>
<p>打開門縫窺望外面街燈都熄滅了除了黑越越以外看不見甚麼這是我有生以來所碰到的最黑暗的一夜我心中不禁悶然——今晚還得出去呢</p>
<p>我連忙把頭縮回來心中在盤算著這樣全市像烏雅一樣黑暗的夜裹跑出門去舉手不見五指大家都得像瞎子那樣地摸索豈不是要闖出禍來我有一點擔憂起來了</p>
<p>但是仔細一聽外面閣閣的步履之聲不絕於耳走路的人好像不少腳步似乎也相當的快人家會走難道我就不能</p>
<p>放膽開門出去置身於茫茫的黑夜之中四顧黑漆一團令人有不知東西南北之感在黑暗中站立了不到半分鐘黑暗的威脅彷佛已經消退了一點我逐漸看得出幢幢的人影了我看清了房屋的輪廓我看見了灰藍色的天空我看見天上的雲也看到了天上點點的星星於是我看清了我該走的路向邁步向目的地走去</p>
<p>社會的黑暗也是如此青年們震於社會黑暗之威名常有望社會而卻步的其實你如果衝進社會去置身於社會之中你對社會就可以有比較清楚的認識你就可以明白社會並不是全部暗無天日的在黑暗籠罩之上你可以更清楚地看到四週的事物你也可以看見微微透亮的天和光閃的星你如果有一定的路向的話你還是可以自由走你的路的</p>
<p>社會的黑暗原是要我們去加以征服的</p>

<h3>教師與同學</h3>
<p>— 揚子江</p>
<p>目前正是一個劇烈地動亂著的時代週圍的朋友亦都無可避免地起了顯著的變動我感覺這些變動中間蘊藏著無限的感慨更襯托著不少現實的問題</p>
<p>在學校裹讀書的時候我認識了教經濟學的Ｈ接受者他自從深造回國以後本埠幾所著名大學裹擔任教席他的淵博的學識正確的理論倜儻的風度學者的態度正不知影響了多少青年學子造就了幾許有為人材而我因為對他非常欽佩的緣故所以是特別地接近</p>
<p>離開學校後我總覺得對Ｈ教授講授的課程是最有心得了的教程總是佔著學校生活中最有收穫最值得留戀的一頁</p>
<p>數天前我在霞飛路上一家羅宋大菜館裹意外地遇到了他久遠的闊別意外的相逢使我們倍感親切</p>
<p>我倆便重溫往昔在校時歡談的舊夢漸漸地把話題移到最近的生活上去他依舊用著一舊時在教室裹上課時的風度並談涉了些關於肯列氏的貨幣理論紀豐氏的幣價變動定律等經濟理論接著又用一種沉著的語調對我說</p>
<p>現在社會的一切都顯示著反常目前我個人的經濟生活亦是無可避免地感到困難假使我做了市儈那末只要將在出國後所化費的美金囤積著到現在不亦是成了一個百萬富翁一一雖然在目前百萬富翁已僅有統計學上的意義了哈哈這幾聲笑聲如像是諷刺又好嘲笑</p>
<p>我欽佩他的清高我敬仰他的精神</p>
<p>餐後我終於依依地和他握別心中卻是若有所失氦的</p>
<p>二年前我們的一個中學時代的舊同學在Ｘ立音樂專校畢了業我們都非常地替他欣喜在目前音樂人材是多麼缺乏音樂人材是多有前途啊他自己亦懷著熱望的心情離開了學校踏進了這個社會他有樂觀他亦有自信</p>
<p>不久就找到了一個理想的職業一一在中學裹擔任音樂教務可是待遇當然是和一般的同樣菲薄這帶來了失望於是就想改入商界勉渡一個時期可是那裹需求研究音樂的來擔任商業上的職務呢這又帶來了第二個失望</p>
<p>幾月前我得到了他已返回故鄉開設小規模商店的消息這意外的事簡直使我不能置信直到最近我方得到他的詳細的來信</p>
<p>目前物價昂漲雖說小肆獲利極豐已無須再受在滬執教時之困苦矣然處此窮鄉幾與音樂完全絕緣且被迫而幹與本身意志相違之事精神上所感受之痛苦自不待言文化人之命運茍竟若斯則中世紀歐洲之黑暗時代豈又重見於此地之今日歟</p>

<p>（三）星海浮沈錄</p>
<p>京戲的伶人各有師承有的從名師的從科班學藝話劇演員現在還沒有譚派麒派之分其出處就很可研究顯然地話劇在現在還沒有科班有的是國立戲劇專科學校可是創辦未久所培養的人才還不多目前各劇團中的演員最多數的來源可以分成二類一種是在業餘劇社演過戲成績相當不壞經人介紹而變成職業演員另一種則是當劇團演員不敷時公開招考經過表演口試等手續二考出身的</p>
<p>現在譬如說我在業餘劇社演過九個戲成績都很不錯在這個劇社裹儼然主角演員也許你某次演出的導演某先生在某某劇團演戲於是你常常去看白戲又到後臺去玩然後你請某先生替你介紹進去演戲某先生就記在心上也許有一天在排新艱苦演員表的時候缺少一個僕人或是十來句話的角色某先生就說我有一個朋友叫他來演哪於是你期待的天終於來了在職為舞臺上露臉和平日所欽佩的大演員同臺那時你的心會跳得多麼快可是一看角色起碼得很想想自己在業餘劇社裹主角都不高興演可是唉還是忍耐點於是你就開始排戲了這個戲也許根本就沒有你顯本事的地方或是一上臺又犯了上場慌那你的前途就很危險不過也許你演得還穏健同時他們又需要人於是一個戲之後就請你簽合同可是也不過繼續跑在套而已這樣地跑了一兩年那時也許會派個比較重要的角色給你那就是你成名的最重要的機會一切都得看你自己的努力了也許你聽得不大高興什麼跑龍套得跑一兩年對的這還是好的有時第一次登臺就派你一個重要的角色也許第一次排演的時候他們不滿意你就完了——連兩年後的那個機會都沒有了至於公開招考每次總有二三百人到六七百人在這許多人裹經過初試復試口試等像沙中淘金收件　錄取了六七個人而這百分之一的幸運兒踏進舞臺之門也不過開始他嘍囉僕人第三流演員的龍套生活罷</p>
<p>你常在看戲覺得有九個人演得很嫩氣那麼請你原他也許他是首次上臺不過他究竟還是幸運因為每年有五六百個候補演員在後臺門口失望地走出去剩下地五六個每天不分日夜在舞臺上辛勤工作著一年兩年也許幾年後他也許就是一個燦爛的大明星呢</p>

<h3>Caucasus German Forces Attack Tuapse Port, Encircled; Soviets Resolute to Defend to the Death; Intense Artillery Battles North of Stalingrad</h3>
<p>German Leader's Headquarters, 14th, Huitong News Agency Telegram</p>
<p>Today's German war report states that with the assistance of aircraft, German forces in the Caucasus continue to occupy several high grounds on the road between Mei Guipu and Tuapse. In the battle, a German division independently captured one hundred enemy strongholds. Soviet counter-attacks on the Stalingrad and Kerch front lines have been repelled. German aircraft bombed troop and war material transport on the east bank of the Volga River and attacked Soviet airfields in the Black Sea. A Soviet medium-sized merchant ship was lost in the Volga River. Italian aircraft shot down two enemy aircraft on the Don River front. In the central sector of the Eastern Front, German forces captured sixty-four enemy strongholds, capturing many prisoners. German aircraft attacked enemy ships at low altitude over the Gulf of Finland, with one Soviet gunboat hit and on fire.</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th, Huitong News Agency Telegram</p>
<p>Military circles here issued a statement this afternoon on the situation on the Eastern Front, stating that German forces in the Caucasus have occupied several high grounds, annihilating a portion of the enemy forces and capturing hundreds of underground artillery positions. Enemy counter-attacks on the Stalingrad and Don River fronts have been repelled. Apart from this, there are only local battles on the Eastern Front. In the central sector of the Eastern Front, German forces captured sixty-four enemy strongholds and captured a large number of prisoners.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 14th, Havas News Agency Telegram</p>
<p>Military observers here believe that the most noteworthy aspect of the Eastern Front battlefield is that German forces are only a few miles away from Tuapse Port. However, the geographical conditions of this war zone are favorable to the Soviet Union, and the German forces still face various difficulties. Therefore, the port is not likely to fall for the time being. The German side has concentrated two infantry divisions, mountain troops, and a Slovak motorized unit in the Kupen River basin and along the Black Sea coast. Recently, infantry reinforcements and a large blood clot tank brigade have been transferred in, and since the 12th of this month, they have launched a large-scale offensive under the cover of artillery fire. This fortress is very important, and the Red Army is willing to defend the port to the death at any cost. If it unfortunately falls, the Soviet Black Sea Fleet will lose another base, and the German forces will gain a gateway to invade the Transcaucasus region. In addition, according to German sources, the Soviet Union is preparing to launch large-scale counter-attacks in the areas north of Smolensk, Rzhev, and Stalingrad. Soviet transportation on the Volga River is frequent and increasing daily. In the Stalingrad area, German forces are still launching repeated attacks in the northwest industrial area to reduce General Timoshenko's pressure between the Don and Volga Rivers.</p>
<p>A Certain Place on the Ukrainian Border, 14th, Havas News Agency Telegram</p>
<p>Observers here are currently analyzing the situation on the Eastern Front: (1) Tuapse Port has been surrounded by German forces that have reached the Black Sea coast a few miles south of the port. The situation in the area has temporarily stalled to allow German forces to calmly prepare for the siege. (2) The Red Army's resistance in the Losni area is exceptionally fierce, but all Red Army attacks have been repelled. German forces have made little progress in the Ottrozhnycheetz and Gebos outpost areas. Snowstorms in the area hinder operations greatly. (3) Stalingrad: There has only been intense artillery fire in the area in the past 24 hours. It is said that this is the new strategy of the German High Command to destroy the last resistance centers of the Red Army. Once the major factories and houses currently held by the Red Army are destroyed, the German side will launch an infantry assault. At the same time, fierce fighting continues north of the city. The Red Army has constructed and consolidated a large bridgehead in Kachalinsk, but neither side has achieved decisive results. (4) A Berlin spokesperson stated that fighting is breaking out and subsiding alternately on both banks of the Don River. Observers here believe that this is direct proof of the Red Army's arrival at the Don River bend. (5) The Voronezh area has been quiet for a week, but it is reported that the Red Army has made several local attacks and concentrated a large force.</p>
<h3>German Forces in Stalingrad and the Caucasus Change Tactics</h3>
<p>A Certain Place on the Soviet Border, 13th, Havas News Agency Telegram</p>
<p>According to a telegram from neutral observers on the Eastern Front, the German forces operating in Stalingrad and the Caucasus have now changed their tactics. Until now, the tactics used in all battlefields have always been those of the First World War, with artillery units as the vanguard, followed by tanks, and infantry units closely following the motorized units. However, based on the experience of this war, this tactic is clearly no longer suitable because anti-tank guns are becoming increasingly advanced, and tank losses are heavy. In view of this, the German forces are preparing to dispatch a small number of machine gun teams to infiltrate the Red Army lines, specifically to destroy enemy anti-tank guns so that they cannot be used. Then, they will order armored units to launch an attack. According to front-line news, the fighting in the Stalingrad area is still ongoing north of the city. The blood clot army in the Mok area has received reinforcements and is attacking the Red Army no less than six or seven times a day.</p>
<h3>Asia Development Group Conference Decides on Concrete Measures, Oka Explains Reasons for Proposal</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th, Domei News Agency Telegram</p>
<p>The Liaison Conference of the Sino-Japanese-Manchu Asia Development Groups continued its meeting at the Greater East Asia Hall here at 9:00 AM on the 14th. The primary goal of today's meeting was to discuss the concrete implementation of the Sino-Japanese-Manchu Joint Declaration. First, the proposal submitted by the Greater Japan Asia Development Alliance was discussed. The president of the alliance, Mansuke Yamaoka, explained the reasons for the proposal. Representatives from the Manchurian Concord Association, Zhang Huanxiang; the Chinese East Asia League, Lin Baisheng; the New People's Association, Zhang Zijun; and the Mongolian Asia Development Cooperation Conference, Chen Yuming, successively expressed their opinions. They all agreed that the key to world peace lies in the development of Asia. Based on this premise, the formation of the core of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is a necessity. To realize this, the three governments should contact each other and formulate concrete measures. The people of China, Japan, and Manchuria are the central pillars of the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia and should maintain close contact with each other, cooperate, and launch an Asia Development National Movement. Finally, Mitsuo Miyata, a permanent advisor from the Japanese side, expressed his support. Everyone stood up to show their support. President Lin decided to adopt the proposal, and the meeting adjourned at noon. In the afternoon, all the representatives visited the Painting Museum and the Naval Memorial Hall. At 5:00 PM, they went to the Imperial Hotel to attend a banquet hosted by seven economic groups. The general meeting is scheduled to continue in the morning of the 15th. In the afternoon, they plan to visit Yushima Seido and Tokyo Imperial University again, and at 3:30 PM, they will attend a garden party hosted jointly by the Tokyo Prefectural and Municipal Governments at Korakuen.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 14th, Domei News Agency Telegram</p>
<p>The Greater Japan Asia Development Alliance submitted a proposal for the concrete implementation of the Sino-Japanese-Manchu Joint Declaration at the Liaison Conference of the Sino-Japanese-Manchu Asia Development Groups, and President Yamaoka explained the reasons for the proposal. The details are as follows: (Summary of the Proposal) (1) In the future, such conferences will be held at appropriate times. The timing and methods will be decided before the next meeting. (2) Regularly exchange mining well engineers to gather common intentions regarding the Asia Development concept. (3) Publish magazines, exchange books, exchange information, and cooperate in various movements. (4) Maintain close contact with each other regarding cultural propaganda. (5) Personnel from each group should inspect and visit each other to enhance mutual friendship. (Reasons for the Proposal) In order to drive out the invading forces of Britain and the United States, ensure the security of East Asia, and further contribute to world peace, greater efforts must be made in the future. It goes without saying that the total strength of the people of all countries must be united to establish a system in which all ethnic groups in Greater East Asia are one family, and to actively launch an Asia Development movement is essential. There are many measures to implement this, but the most important is to make the Sino-Japanese-Manchu Joint Declaration concrete and to make this the focus of the issue. The Sino-Japanese-Manchu Joint Declaration is based on the spirit of morality, establishes a common goal of building a new order in East Asia, and the three countries of China, Japan, and Manchuria will form a permanent peaceful pivot. With this as the center, we will move forward in the construction of Greater East Asia. Therefore, planning for cooperation in national defense, thorough anti-communism, and economic promotion are all necessary. Therefore, it is necessary to launch an Asia Development movement based on the Three-Nation Joint Declaration. To make the Three-Nation Joint Declaration concrete, five measures are proposed.</p>

<h3>Stimson Asks U.S. Congress to Lower the Draft Age from 20 to 18</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 14th, Domei News Agency Telegram</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of War Stimson yesterday asked Congress to quickly pass a bill to lower the draft age from 20 to 18. Stimson also said that the United States is at a critical juncture and urgently needs additional soldiers. This bill has been under review by the Military Affairs Committees of both houses of Congress. The House Military Affairs Committee will begin discussions today and then submit it to the House for discussion on Saturday. The Senate will discuss it in two weeks.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram</p>
<p>In his fireside chat on the 12th, U.S. President Roosevelt specially declared that in order to remedy the problem of labor shortage, requisition orders must be applied to rural factories. At the same time, in response to this talk, Secretary of the Army Stimson sent a letter to Congress on the 13th requesting that the current minimum age of 20 for conscription be changed to 18. This matter has been made into a draft amendment to the conscription law by the upper and lower houses and, in response to the requirements of Roosevelt and Stimson, is prepared to begin deliberation in a public meeting on the 14th. For Stimson's original letter will take the form of a report. The general idea of ​​Stimson's original letter, which was officially published on the 13th after Roosevelt's fireside chat, is that we are at a critical juncture today, so we ask the parliament to amend the conscription law as soon as possible and change the minimum age for conscription to 18 years of age. It is most necessary for the United States to maintain a majority of soldiers at this time. Our most important responsibility to the modern American people and our children is to build the world's best army in the shortest possible time. This responsibility is also an urgent matter that cannot be delayed for a moment, and if we want to have an army, we must not only have excellent equipment, but also ensure that the talents, confidence, combat will, and energy of a soldier are all able to pretend to drive enemy soldiers. In addition, Roosevelt previously stated that there was no need to lower the conscription age before January or February of next year, but the government's request to amend the conscription law immediately is expected to be due to the expansion of the war, which has required a larger amount of manpower than expected. At the same time, it was determined that the soldiers around the age of 40 who were recruited according to the current conscription law were unable to undergo strenuous training, so this decision was made. According to the estimation of the Bureau of the Census, there are about 2.5 million young people in the United States aged 18 and 19, but most of them have responded to the recruitment of the army and navy and have enlisted, so it is predicted that the number of people who can be obtained after this conscription age is reduced to about one million.</p>

Since the submarine warfare in the Atlantic Ocean has moved from the Trinidad area to the southern waters, I have made this trip to discuss the implementation of joint operations with the Brazilian naval authorities.</p>
<h3>French Forces in Madagascar Retreat to New Positions</h3>
<p>Vichy, 14th, Huitong News Agency Telegram</p>
<p>Officials here announced today that after fierce fighting with British forces north of Ambovietra in Madagascar, French forces have now retreated to new positions. The enemy suffered considerable damage in this battle.</p>
<h3>Spokespersons for Various Governments (III)</h3>
<h3>The Role of the United Kingdom</h3>
<p>Before the war, the British spokesperson in the Foreign Office was not a significant figure. Based on our experience, we know that two individuals took turns fulfilling the role of spokesperson. Their method was to alternate, saying, "I have no comment today," or, "I'm afraid I cannot tell you."</p>
<p>Mr. Peak was not well-liked among the group of journalists, including the British reporters. Later, he followed the new Ambassador to the United States, Lord Halifax, to Washington as an intelligence attaché.</p>
<p>The other spokesperson, Mr. Readsdale, was a pleasant fellow. Although he often felt compelled to say, like his superior Mr. Peak, "I'm afraid I cannot tell you," his fixed response was delivered so kindly that the reporters seemed to perceive a deeper meaning.</p>
<h3>Spokespersons in the Far East</h3>
<p>Outside of America, no other place in the world has newspaper circulation as extensive as Japan, especially in Tokyo. Therefore, it is easy to understand why the Japanese government has always paid special attention to newspapers, especially foreign newspapers. Thus, as in other locations, the role of government spokesperson in Japan largely involved paying attention to foreign newspapers. Initially, the spokesperson was an official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This system remained unchanged for the first three years of the Sino-Japanese War. It was only after the establishment of the Information Bureau in 1940 that officials from the Information Bureau assumed the role of spokesperson.</p>
<p>The first spokesperson was Ishii, who was transferred to the Japanese Embassy in Bangkok when the Greater East Asia War was about to erupt. His successor, the current spokesperson, is Mr. Hori. Like Ishii, Hori's specialty lies in his understanding of foreign newspapers. As a result of the war, the scale of Hori's press conferences has become smaller. Aside from journalists from the Axis powers of Japan, Germany, and Italy, only one French and two Soviet reporters participate. The largest group of foreign reporters is German, with fourteen individuals representing various German news agencies and newspapers.</p>
<p>Hori's special strength lies in his thorough commentary on the current situation. His commentaries are complete from start to finish and do not require deletion or additions to be published as carefully written political essays. Consequently, the Axis powers often publish his commentaries as political essays. His experience in the diplomatic service and his previous experience as a spokesperson elsewhere greatly assist him in his current role. From 1924 to 1928, Hori was a secretary at the Japanese Embassy in Washington. He was briefly transferred to Qingdao, Nanjing, and Shanghai. Then, in 1934, he was transferred to the United States as a consul in Los Angeles until 1937. In 1937, he went to Qingdao to serve as the spokesperson for joint press conferences held by the Japanese Consulate and the Japanese Army and Navy authorities. It was only when he served as the Japanese spokesperson in Shanghai from December 1940 that he became famous. Later, he was transferred to his current position—Director of the Publicity Department of the Information Bureau.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the importance of the Information Bureau has certainly increased. News originating from Tokyo occupies the main space in newspapers worldwide. Especially with the Japanese government issuing a series of reports on the unprecedented victories of the army, navy, and air force, global newspapers pay even greater attention to news from Tokyo. The term "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" was first used by the Japanese spokesperson before being transmitted to newspapers and the public worldwide.</p>
<p>In contrast to the situation in many countries, Japan has several spokespersons. Mr. Hori only comments on purely political events. For military matters, there are separate spokespersons for the Army and Navy. These two spokespersons do not host foreign journalists but regularly broadcast military-related commentary on the radio. Therefore, foreign journalists frequently listen to their statements. Occasionally, Mr. Hori also broadcasts comments on purely political events domestically via radio. Outside of Japan, especially in Shanghai and Beijing, there are also press conferences held by the Japanese authorities.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the Japanese Army spokesperson is Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama, the Navy spokesperson is Ambassador Kamata, and the Embassy spokesperson is Hirota. The fact that the Japanese side has appointed these outstanding individuals as spokespersons demonstrates the importance they attach to this issue. Like Mr. Hori, Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama only became famous after assuming the position of Japanese Army spokesperson in Shanghai. These three spokespersons, accompanied by some deputy spokespersons and a few clever interpreters, host reporters from China, Japan, Germany, Italy, France, and Russia twice a week at the Cathay Hotel, discussing current events in a harmonious atmosphere.</p>
<p>The Japanese government has consistently adopted a policy of freedom of speech. Therefore, it was only after four years of the Sino-Japanese War that Japan began to compile news. However, even after the outbreak of the Pacific War, news censorship remained very lenient. Especially since most of the foreign reporters in Tokyo were nationals of Japan's allied countries, the Japanese government's attitude was even more tolerant. (End)</p>

<h3>Two Key Officials of the Shanghai Municipal Council Promoted</h3>
<p>Mr. Kinjiro Noguchi, Section Chief of the General Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council, has been approved by the Council to be promoted to Assistant General Manager, effective October 1st of this year. Mr. Noguchi was born in 1902 and graduated from Nihon University in Tokyo in 1927 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. In 1930, he went to England for two years of study.

<h3>Number of Identification Cards Issued in Each District of the French Concession</h3>
<p>Statistics on the number of identification and residence cards issued in each district of the French Concession (as of the end of September) are as follows: Xiaodongmen District: 10,379 cards; Mailan District: 34,010 cards; Xuhui District: 48,000 cards; Central District: 48,028 cards; Foch District: 35,689 cards; Petain District: 20,435 cards.</p>

<h3>Price Controls on Meat Implemented by the Shanghai Municipal Council; Black Market Continues to Exist; Supply Fails to Meet Demand, Pork Still Purchased at High Prices, with the Highest Price Reaching 18 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that most vegetable market vendors and butcher shops in the Public Concession yesterday (the 13th) were selling beef and mutton in accordance with the maximum retail price limit promulgated by the Shanghai Municipal Council. However, the sale of pork remains in a state of extreme chaos. For example, pork leg or loin meat is priced as high as 16 to 18 yuan per pound, while the limit price announced by the Shanghai Municipal Council is 8.40 yuan.</p>
<p>Still Need to Purchase Pork at High Prices</p>
<p>Butcher shops in both concessions and some vendors in vegetable markets such as Seymour Road do sell a small amount of pork at the limit price. However, this is far from sufficient to meet the daily needs of residents. Therefore, most housewives who want to purchase pork have no choice but to pay a high price of 16 to 18 yuan per pound, especially in the Hongkou vegetable market. Vendors in that market sell pork for no less than 18 yuan. Butchers in northern Shanghai say that they cannot sell various types of pork at the Shanghai Municipal Council's limit price because they would incur losses. They purchase entire pigs from the slaughterhouse based on the total weight. However, after the pigs are slaughtered, there is considerable weight loss. Since the pig's head and other parts cannot be sold at a good price, they have no choice but to charge a higher price to compensate for this loss.</p>
<p>Supply Fails to Meet Demand, with Numerous Malpractices</p>
<p>According to investigations conducted by reporters, the price of pork at the Pike Road vegetable market yesterday was the most reasonable, sold at the controlled price. Each person could purchase a maximum of one catty. However, the amount was insufficient, and the vendors made exorbitant profits. Customers did not dare to argue because they felt fortunate to be able to purchase a small amount of pork. The price of pork at the Fuzhou Road vegetable market was 16 to 18 yuan per pound, but there were still many buyers. The situation in the French Concession was similar. Many people believe that the main reason for the high price of pork and the existence of a black market is the scarcity of goods.</p>
<p>Price Controls on Beef and Mutton Prove Effective</p>
<p>Although retail price controls on beef and mutton were only implemented yesterday, good results have already been seen. Experts from the Goods Control Section of both concessions have clearly closely controlled the supply and distribution of beef. Although there is a price limit, a large amount of beef is still available. Because the demand is high, sales are also rapid. Yesterday afternoon, some butcher shops were unwilling to sell certain types of beef at the limit price. However, it is generally expected that after inspectors from the Goods Control Section discover violations and impose heavy penalties, butchers will strictly adhere to the limit price.</p>
<h3>French Concession Periodically Replaces Rickshaw Pullers' Licenses</h3>
<p>The French Police Department will begin replacing public rickshaw pullers' permits at the Vehicle Affairs Office, 28 Route Tenant de la Tour, starting November 2, 1942. Except for Sundays, the office hours for issuing badges are from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM daily. Rickshaw pullers with permits must go to replace their new licenses on the following specified dates: Numbers 1 to 10,000: November 2nd to 7th; Numbers 10,001 to 20,000: November 9th to 14th; Numbers 20,001 to 30,000: November 16th to 21st. Those who are late must replace their licenses between November 23rd and 28th. Expired licenses will not be reissued. All old licenses that have not been renewed by November 30th of this year will be invalidated.</p>
<h3>Criminal Report for the French Concession</h3>
<p>The French Concession Police Department's criminal report for September states that there were three armed robbery cases in early September, all committed by two robbers, one of whom had a pistol. The two robbers were arrested on September 13, and the pistol was seized at their residence. It was later determined that the pistol had been robbed from a Sikh watchman in the Public Concession on February 13 of this year. In addition, most of the stolen goods were recovered. In September, there was one attempted assassination, 21 burglary cases, 44 breaking-and-entering cases, and 12 robbery cases, of which 44 cases were solved, and 27 criminals were arrested. In the same month, there were only 261 simple theft cases reported, compared to 286 in August, of which 67 cases were solved, and 69 criminals were arrested. A total of 60 bicycles were stolen. Eleven thieves were arrested, and 12 stolen bicycles were recovered. In addition, the household registration office of the French Concession Police Department issued a total of 89,566 identification cards in September, 22,092 people moved out, 16,518 people moved in, 1,517 births were recorded, and 835 deaths were recorded.</p>
<h3>Fourteenth Period Ration Quantities</h3>
<p>Rations for the fourteenth period in both concessions will be distributed from the 12th to the 19th of this month at each rice shop, with each ration ticket entitling the holder to one sheng of white rice and half a sheng of broken rice, for a total price of 3.80 yuan. At the same time, the ticket holder can purchase 1.5 jin of flour at a price of 3.40 yuan.</p>
<h3>Renhua Tang Wang Generously Donates Scholarship Fund</h3>
<p>Our newspaper's scholarship fund received a generous donation of 10,000 yuan from Chen Yantai Tang the day before yesterday for the second time.

<h3>It's Easy to Study, Hard to Eat: YMCA Opens Student Cafeteria, Eagerly Awaits Assistance from Sympathizers</h3>
<p>The difficulty students currently face in eating is a universal phenomenon. There are two ways to solve this problem: (1) Universally open economic, nutritious, and hygienic cafeterias (2) Provide relief to students with general financial difficulties. The Shanghai YMCA Student Relief Committee's movement to open student cafeterias and subsidize meals for impoverished students is launched to meet this need. It is hoped that all sectors will work hard to donate and send funds to the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge or the YWCA at 638 Weihaiwei Road. What is published here is the cry of those who feel the pain firsthand. Since the YMCA has shouldered the heavy responsibility of solving the problem of students eating, let us all share some of the burden. Let us unite and help the YMCA (Editor).</p>
<h3>A Meal Costs at Least Three Yuan</h3>
<p>When classmates meet, they sometimes discuss lunch, and almost everyone frowns and sighs, "Eating is difficult."</p>
<p>If you live so far from school, and you want to rush home after class, take the tram, eat a quick lunch, and then rush back to school by tram, don't even mention how expensive the tram fares are now, just the time alone is too late. Moreover, rushing after a meal is far from healthy.</p>
<p>If you don't go home, then have lunch outside. Choose the most economical restaurant near the school to eat a set meal. Hey, each meal costs at least three yuan. Six meals a week, at least three or four hundred yuan per semester. Our tuition fee is only two or three hundred yuan per semester!</p>
<p>Since set meals are so expensive, save a little and eat a bowl of plain noodles or buy a bread to fill your stomach. But a bowl of plain noodles is shallow, and after eating one bowl, people always feel like having another. And bread is cold and hard. After eating it, you really want to have a cup of hot tea to feel comfortable. As a result, although the price of plain noodles and bread is not much cheaper compared to set meals, your health has already been affected after a few months.</p>
<h3>Students from Other Provinces Face Even Greater Difficulties</h3>
<p>Just eating a lunch outside has already made the students feel so much trouble, but there are also students who come to Shanghai to study from other provinces, which is two or three times more trouble, or even more. Some of them live in schools that only provide accommodation but not meals, and some rent a room with several classmates and take care of their own meals. This is really terrible. Just imagine, getting up early in the morning, lighting the stove, finishing breakfast, cleaning up the dishes, and then going to school with a satchel. What is this like? Moreover, these days, rice is expensive, vegetables are expensive, oil is expensive, salt is expensive, and firewood is also expensive. In this case, at the end of the month, each person will probably need at least two or three hundred yuan per month.</p>
<h3>Impact on Youth Health</h3>
<p>In general schools, there are indeed many students who live a wealthy life on weekdays, but there are also quite a few students with difficult circumstances. After class, seven or eight students sit together and chat idly, talking about world events and then turning to personal matters. The conversation then turns to each person's health problems.</p>
<p>Student A said: "My stomach has been hurting a lot these days. This is the result of eating hard bread for the past six months."</p>
<p>Student B said: "Isn't that right? My stomach problems are also getting worse. I'm always hungry. It hurts when I'm hungry, and I eat when it hurts, but I can't eat much. But after a short time, I immediately feel hungry and in pain again. It's a three-part symphony of eating."</p>
<p>Student C said: "I have insomnia at night, nerve pain, weak limbs, and a sore back. The doctor said it's a lack of nutrition and told me to pay more attention to the ingredients of food in the future. But where does the money come from?"</p>
<p>Student D said: "I have to light the stove, buy vegetables, cook, and wash clothes every day. These things are really tiring. How can I have the mind to study? By the evening, God knows how tired I am."</p>
<h3>Need for a Healthy Body</h3>
<p>Really, if we were to conduct an on-the-spot investigation of the students' health problems, it would really be shocking. Stomach pain and lung disease are common diseases among students. Fatigue, malnutrition, and emotional irritability are common situations among students. Among ten students, it is rare to find two or three who fully meet the standards of good health.</p>
<p>Education is the first step to a career, but to succeed in education, you must first have a healthy body. Pale-faced scholars who are prone to illness are no longer welcome in modern society. We need lively and robust young people to be the masters of our future society. Then, how should we care about the physical health of the students who will become the masters of the future?</p>
<h3>Realization of the Ideal Cafeteria</h3>
<p>In the past, many students were always fantasizing that it would be best to have such an ideal restaurant, with economical prices, clean food, and ingredients that meet the principles of nutrition, and the location would be best not far from the school. In that case, students who live far from home would not have to rush home to eat lunch or swallow plain noodles and chew hard bread to fill their stomachs within an hour and a half, resulting in stomach problems. Students from other provinces who take care of their own meals would not have to waste a lot of good time on trivial matters such as lighting the stove and cooking.</p>
<p>Sometimes ideals can really become reality. Isn't that right? The student cafeteria opened by the YMCA arose in response to this need. Economical, clean, and meeting the principles of nutrition, we have not found all these characteristics in any other place so far. Of course, the student cafeteria has not reached 100% of the ideal, but in this difficult time, it is really a blessing for the students to have such a cafeteria. It is hoped that enthusiastic people in the society will pay more attention to this issue and support this movement to help students with their meals.</p>

However, the new shares of Daguanming and Meilun two dyeing and weaving factories will be listed soon, and there will be a vigorous atmosphere, and the transaction is quite prosperous.

The bullish side in the market bravely came out, but failed to find supply exceeding demand, only the highest price of type C was pressed down by more than one yuan to seven yuan and three cents. It is estimated that five types of public bonds have seen new high prices, all of which have exceeded Monday's high prices, and those who pull in are still making every effort.

<h3>Night of Air Raid Drill and Blackout</h3>
<p>— Wu Xu</p>
<p>The air raid began, with small lights lit, and there were tense shouts outside.</p>
<p>We covered the windows with heavy black curtains, and the lampshade also put on a black overcoat. The walls were dim, and the light was concentrated in the center of the room.</p>
<p>I opened a crack in the door and peeked out. The streetlights were all off. Besides being pitch black, I couldn't see anything. This was the darkest night I had ever encountered in my life, and I couldn't help but feel suffocated in my heart—I had to go out tonight!</p>
<p>I quickly pulled my head back and pondered in my heart. Running out in such a dark night, with the whole city as dark as a crow, with everyone unable to see their fingers and groping around like blind people, wouldn't that cause trouble? I was a little worried.</p>
<p>But after listening carefully, the sound of footsteps outside was endless. There seemed to be many people walking, and their steps seemed to be quite fast. If others can walk, why can't I?</p>
<p>I boldly opened the door and went out, placing myself in the vast darkness. Looking around, it was a pitch-black mass, making people feel disoriented. Standing in the darkness for less than half a minute, the threat of darkness seemed to have subsided a little. I gradually made out vague figures of people. I saw the outlines of the houses. I saw the gray-blue sky. I saw the clouds in the sky and also saw the stars in the sky. So I saw the direction I should go and strode towards my destination.</p>
<p>The darkness of society is also like this. Young people, shocked by the reputation of social darkness, often shy away from society. In fact, if you rush into society and place yourself in society, you can have a clearer understanding of society. You can understand that society is not entirely dark and without sunlight. Above the darkness, you can see the surrounding things more clearly. You can also see the faintly bright sky and the shimmering stars. If you have a certain direction, you can still freely walk your own path.</p>
<p>The darkness of society is originally meant for us to conquer.</p>

<h3>Teachers and Classmates</h3>
<p>— Yangzijiang</p>
<p>Currently, we are in an era of drastic turmoil. The friends around me have inevitably undergone significant changes. I feel that these changes contain infinite emotion and highlight many realistic problems.</p>
<p>When I was studying at school, I met H, the economics teacher. After returning to China from further studies, he took up teaching positions in several famous universities in this city. His extensive knowledge, correct theory, unrestrained demeanor, and scholarly attitude have influenced countless young students and cultivated many talented people. Because I admired him very much, I was particularly close to him.</p>
<p>After leaving school, I always felt that the courses taught by Professor H were the most insightful and rewarding, always occupying the most fruitful and memorable page of my school life.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I unexpectedly encountered him in a Russian restaurant on Avenue Joffre. The long separation and unexpected reunion made us feel particularly close.</p>
<p>We relived the old dream of happy conversations in school and gradually shifted the topic to recent life. He still used the same demeanor as when he taught in the classroom and talked about some economic theories such as Keynes's monetary theory and Jevons's law of price fluctuations. Then, he said to me in a calm tone:</p>
<p>"Everything in society now shows abnormalities. Currently, my personal economic life is inevitably feeling difficult. If I had become a merchant, I would have only needed to hoard the US dollars I spent after going abroad, and I would have become a millionaire by now—although millionaires only have statistical significance at present, haha." These few laughs seemed like sarcasm and mockery.</p>
<p>I admire his integrity and respect his spirit.</p>
<p>After the meal, I finally reluctantly shook hands with him, but I felt a sense of loss in my heart.</p>
<p>Two years ago, one of our old classmates from middle school graduated from the X Li Conservatory of Music. We were all very happy for him. In the current situation, musical talent is so scarce, and musical talent has such a promising future! He himself also left school with hopeful feelings and stepped into this society. He had optimism, and he also had confidence.</p>
<p>Soon, he found an ideal job—working as a music teacher in a middle school. But the salary was of course as meager as usual, which brought disappointment. So he wanted to switch to the business world to make a living for a period of time. But where could he find someone who studies music to take on a commercial position? This brought a second disappointment.</p>
<p>A few months ago, I received news that he had returned to his hometown and opened a small shop. This unexpected event simply made me unable to believe it. Until recently, I received a detailed letter from him:</p>
<p>"Currently, prices are soaring. Although it is said that small shops are making huge profits, there is no need to suffer the hardships of teaching in Shanghai. However, in this remote country, I am almost completely isolated from music and forced to do things that go against my own will. The spiritual pain I feel is self-evident. If the fate of cultured people is like this, then will the dark age of medieval Europe reappear in this place today?"</p>

<h3>Life on the Stage</h3>
<p>— Liang Can</p>
<p>(III) Floating and Sinking in the Sea of Stars</p>
<p>Peking Opera actors each have their own teachers. Some learn from famous teachers, and some learn from training classes. Drama actors do not yet have Tan style or Qi style. Their origins are worth studying. Obviously, drama does not yet have training classes. There is a National Academy of Dramatic Arts, but it was founded not long ago, and the talents it has cultivated are not many. Currently, the largest number of actors in various drama troupes can be divided into two categories: one is that they have performed in amateur drama clubs and have achieved considerable success, and they have become professional actors through introductions. The other is that when the drama troupe's actors are insufficient, they publicly recruit and are recruited through procedures such as performance auditions.</p>
<p>Now, for example, I have performed in nine plays in an amateur drama club, and the results have been very good. I am like a leading actor in this drama club. Perhaps the director of one of your performances, Mr. So-and-so, is acting in a certain drama troupe. So you often go to see free plays and go backstage to play. Then, you ask Mr. So-and-so to introduce you to act. Mr. So-and-so will remember it. Maybe one day when he is arranging a new difficult actor list, and he lacks a servant or a character with a dozen or so words, Mr. So-and-so will say, "I have a friend, let him play it!" So the day you have been waiting for finally comes. It is such an honor to show your face on the stage and be on the same stage with the great actors you usually admire. At that time, how fast your heart will beat! But when you look at the role, you have to think about yourself. In the amateur drama club, the leading actor is not happy to play it, but alas, you still have to be patient. So you start rehearsing. This play may not have a place for you to show your skills at all, or you may be stage fright as soon as you go on stage, then your future will be very dangerous. But maybe you perform steadily, and at the same time they need people, so after a play, they will ask you to sign a contract, but it is just to continue running on the set. After running like this for a year or two, then maybe they will assign you a more important role. That is the most important opportunity for you to become famous. Everything depends on your own efforts. Maybe you are not very happy to hear that you have to run a two-year set. Yes, this is still good. Sometimes, you are assigned an important role the first time you are on stage. Maybe they are not satisfied when you rehearse for the first time, then you are finished—you don't even have that opportunity two years later. As for public recruitment, there are always two or three hundred to six or seven hundred people each time. Among these many people, after the preliminary test, the re-test, and the oral test, like panning for gold in the sand, only six or seven people are selected. And these 1% lucky people who step into the door of the stage are just beginning their set life as a follower, a servant, or a third-rate actor.</p>
<p>You often watch plays and feel that there are nine people who are acting very immaturely, so please forgive him. Maybe it is his first time on stage, but he is still lucky after all, because every year five or six hundred reserve actors walk out of the backstage door in disappointment, leaving the five or six who work hard on the stage day and night. One year, two years, maybe a few years later, he may be a brilliant star!</p>
<h3>In the Same Boat Through Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Branch</p>
<p>(10) Flying Peak</p>
<p>Sister Xi Que and Mother He answered in unison. Huang Longdao, you and Father Huang Shao have wine, come outside to drink! Huang Long said, whether it's good to go outside or not, but Brother Weicheng and Sister Cuizhen are not allowed to cry! Second Aunt, I'm entrusting this matter to you! Huang Long and Mother He went outside. Only three people were left in the room. Second Madam Ye sat on the edge of the bed. Cuizhen was tired and sat on a low stool in front of the bed. Weicheng's face was covered with a glorious question. Sister Cuizhen, you've suffered! Cuizhen said, What does it matter if I suffer a little? Today, Brother Huang saved me from the brink of death, and I met Second Aunt and Brother Cheng in the same room again. This time's happiness is worth ten times the pain! Look, I'm laughing again, haha, I'm really laughing! As she spoke, she hurriedly rolled up her sleeves to wipe her eyes, saying that the dust had obscured them. Second Madam Ye said, Cuizhen, now that you're back, half of the responsibility on my shoulders is gone. You're the best at taking care of patients. You know what the patient needs. You're like drilling into the patient's stomach. In the past, when my sister-in-law was sick, she liked you to come. She was greedy for not taking care of Cuizhen. Cuizhen smiled and said, That's what Second Aunt said!</p>
<p>Weicheng raised his face and smiled, Sister Cuizhen, how come you have a shoe on one foot and no shoe on the other? Cuizhen and Second Madam Ye noticed at the same time. Second Madam Ye said, Hey, what's going on? Cuizhen blushed and said, Ah, I don't know how. Probably I was scared and happy, and only single-mindedly wanted to meet Brother Cheng and Second Aunt. I didn't care about anything else. Only now do I realize that when Brother Huang put me down to walk a few steps, I limped. I only thought that the road was uneven. I never thought that in the devil's house, one foot was wearing shoes and the other was not. This is really a joke! Weicheng suddenly sat up and said, This is what you call being carried away by success! I often have this situation! Where are Cuizhen's shoes? Last time you were robbed by them, and a shoe fell at the door! Second Madam Ye gave Cuizhen a pair of Weicheng's old shoes from under the bed and asked her to wear them temporarily, while hurriedly telling Weicheng to lie down to avoid catching a cold. Then she asked what Cuizhen's situation was after being robbed. (203)</p>
