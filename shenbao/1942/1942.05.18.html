<p>天主敎耶穌會士重來中國，至今歲適滿百年，在此百年之中，對於中國文化，貢獻極大，已山徐宗澤司鐸　者「一百年來耶蘇會譯著概論」一文，刋載四月三百本報。關於天主敎之傳入中國，世人但知利瑪實於明末來華，闡揚敎義，日益光大，以迄今茲；而明空所受公敎之影響，芷籍殊罕記載，茲徐司鐸又根據古代敎士紀述，成「明永曆皇太后等信奉公敎史料及「明室遣使羅馬敎廷」二文證以史書，考據精確，非特爲天主敎之珍貴文獻，抑亦極有價值之史料也。徐司經發掘學術之精神，至堪敬佩！</p>
<p>編者</p>
<p>皈依教化始於崇禎</p>
<p>明末，天主敎史上，有一事足堪記載者，即永曆皇太后皇后等之皈依天主敎是也。先是崇禎皇帝朝，敎化已行宮內，有內官龐天壽，溥樂德等首先奉敎（一六三二年），旣而宮女妃嬪亦多有進敎者。宮中置有聖堂二所，一爲太監，一爲宮女。崇禎十三年十一月，湯若望進呈耶穌行跡畫像，帝深表信心；誠如通鑑謂：「帝以國家多難，日夜憂勞，常默吿上帝，戴罪省愆」。此處所謂上帝，乃指湯若望所謂之天地主宰無疑，又帝覽若望所進畫像後，適有以軍餉乏絕吿急者，崇禎絕不遲疑，命將宮中金銀佛像，盡數鑄化，以濟國庫；至於木質佛像，則一，律焚燬，銅像則鑄以爲錢，宮中廟宇，改爲別用，惟留一寺給諸喇嘛。是時風聲遠佈，謂：崇禎帝已皈依聖敎矣。烈皇小識云：「上初年崇奉天主敎，上海徐光啟，敎中人也，旣人政府，力進天主之說，將宮內供養諸銅像，盡行毀碎。……」惜明空多難，崇禎雖有信心，而實未領洗，李自成進攻，卒慘死煤山。再後十年，而有永曆皇室之進敎事。</p>
<p>瞿焦龐三功臣略歷</p>
<p>溯自流寇北犯，崇禎自戕，福王常泃之子，萬曆帝之孫由崧遂稱帝於南京，（順治二年），是爲明弘光元年；不一年而遇害，南京失守。明宗室諸王中之朱聿鍵乃稱帝於福建，改元隆武。隆武二年八月被淸兵所執，此信傳至廣東，寓居廣東之兵部尙書丁魁楚，侍郎翟式耜即奉桂王朱由榔稱帝於肇慶，改元，永曆，永曆帝時年二十六歲。永曆爲萬曆帝之孫，桂王常瀛之子也。永曆偏安一方，在位十五年，奉敎大官瞿式柜，龐天壽，然璉之功也。</p>
<p>瞿式柜字起田，號稼軒，江蘇常熟縣人，生於萬曆十八年庚寅，四十四年丙辰進士，授知江西永豐縣，天啟元年調湖北江陵縣，崇禎元年　戶科給事中；福王即位南京，式柜爲江寗府府丞右僉都御史，巡撫廣西；永曆元年，式柜進吏部右侍，東閣大學土，兼吏部尙書；二年淸兵破肇慶，永曆帝赴桂林，旣而之南寗；三年夏回肇慶；五年正月又離慶至梧州；式柜奉命留守桂林，十月淸兵進攻桂林，式柜獨守空城，靜坐待死；及淸兵入，再四勸降，以保富貴。式柜義不臣二姓，從容肅衣冠，南向拜訖，遂見殺，謚忠宣。式柜於天啟三年（一六二三）丁憂在家，在艾需略司鐸手領洗入敎，聖名多默。</p>
<p>焦璉字國器，山西人，一言南京人；因平靖江王亨嘉之亂，擢總兵官，隸瞿式柜麾下，與式　守桂林，忠事永曆。明叛將陳邦傳邀焦璉投降；璉以奉敎故，不敢作此不忠事，叱邦傳妄言。邦傳怒，乃設計殺之，函其首投降於淸。璉　烈愍。</p>
<p>龐天壽明永曆帝之司禮監，總攬軍國大權；崇禎五年領洗入敎，聖名亞基一樓。永曆四年，同永曆皇太后一上書羅馬敎皇及耶穌會總長，由下彌格司鐸赴羅馬親上。龐一公忠於永曆帝，又熱心事主，卒于永曆十二年，又調卒於九，十年間者。</p>
<p>永曆帝時，天主敎人之臣服明室，忠心欲恢復明祚者尙多，惜名不傳耳，龐翟焦三公爲主要之人物而已。永曆帝左右旣多奉敎之人，　永曆朝廷多得公敎之影響，而有　化之傾向；而主動之者，乃龐天壽，進行之者瞿安德KoffoerJS，耶穌顯聖太后受洗瞿安總字體泰，奧國人○三年，一六二七年入耶穌會，一六四二年抵澳門，一六四五年，入廣西梧州傳敎，後至肇慶。，龐天壽引見永曆帝。瞿公進呈貢物，並聖母抱耶穌及若翰侍立其側之像。是時永曆帝懼淸來侵，遷徙無定。幫公勸帝與皇太后，皇后及妃嬪等晨晚跪誦天主經，聖母經，信經，以祈求天主，護佑明室，皇上一一實行。皇太后見大勢日迫，亦苦悶殊甚，囚之求道之心，與日俱增。一晚假寐，未能合眼，忽見聖嬰耶穌顯現，謂之曰，若爾不從我，爾將死焉“皇太后聞者，未知有何意義。不久，瞿安德司鐸進呈永曆帝聖丹抱耶穌聖嬰像，皇太后見之，得　前日所　現之聖嬰，即聖丹房抱之耶穌，於是欲　教之心，頓　　　　然　洗猶懷疑莫決。（未完）</p>

<p>— 沛甘</p>
<p>爲了環境的關係，上海成爲各種奇特車輛的集中地。而且上海向來是個五方雜處，人才薈蔚的大商埠，切的新奇東西，不期然而然的，就層出不窮的的登塲了</p>
<p>單以脚踏車馬車而論，各式各樣的車子，在短短的幾個月中，風起雲湧，蔚爲大觀。而尙在設計和製造中的，還不知有若干哩。</p>
<p>汽車，除了燃汽油者之外，柴油，木炭，電氣，煤氣等都可應用，不過在機構方面總得先行改造，始可適應環境。汽車的演進，也正像馬車和脚踏車一樣。</p>
<p>隨圖的輛汽車，前後兩個架子上擱着一個大圓管子，可算得奇形怪狀」了。說句笑話，各人的印象也許會各如共面，譬如揑筆的人見了，以爲它像一枝大號派克；留心時事的說它彷彿是高射砲或長距離大砲；硏究科學的總說有些像顯微鏡的鏡管；而最常令的囤藥商未始不會說它像管巨型的針藥呢！</p>
<p>其實這一種是道地的煤氣汽車。在馬路上也許已有許多人看見過了。論式樣好像很奇怪，似乎在汽車頂上多了一根橫着的大烟囱；其實全車的「生命」就在這個古拙的圓管中呢。</p>
<p>圖巾的汽車係自來火公司所有，在車門上有看「SGC」三個小字母，便是自來火公司的英文縮寫。</p>
<p>這種煤氣車的構造原理，和裝置工程的圖解，現在暫且不提。單講這車頂上的煤氣櫃，裏面大概可容納煤氣一百八十立方尺至二百立方尺。據自來火公司工程師端納君稱，這一百八十多立方尺的煤氣，大概可供十二英里半至十三英里行程之用。</p>
<p>從跑馬廳至外灘爲一英里，如果行駛這種煤氣汽車，那末裝足了一管煤氣之後，來往五六次是綽乎有餘的了。</p>
<p>自來火公司在　洽鄉路（新垃圾橋南首）六　　千六號，坐了這種煤氣汽車往外白渡橋的話，在來去四次的行程中，可無「油」乾拋錨之虞。假使長途行車，一次「打」氣似乎還不够它奔波之需。將來如果沿途有方法灌充煤氣，這種困難當可解決。</p>
<p>自來火公司總工程師辛博森（J．　K．　Singpson），他是這種煤氣汽車的第一個設計者。雖然，這種汽車現在已能在馬路上行駛，司是據該公司工程師的意見，構造方面，尙未臻於完善，有若干地方正在設法改進中。因之現在還未到公開替人家裝製的地步。其已經裝配完成的，像圖中「九二七九」照會號碼的一輛汽車，只供他們公司中職員的應用而已。</p>
<p>話雖如此，煤氣如能述用到汽車上去，那末乾擱在汽車間的若干大小汽車，一旦如法泡製，便能很）活潑地在馬路上飛奔了。除了從前時髦的太太小姐們，在夏天坐在敞車裏，招搖過市，兜風取樂，太過份的享受之外，汽車在實際上的確可以節省許多寳貴的時間和人力。煤氣汽車而能實際運用，未始不是解決交通困靴的一個好消息呢。</p>
<p>據聞公共租界工部局，已有幾輛汽車託自來火公司去改裝這種煤氣設備，大約不久的將來，裝置好的汽車就能實地運用了。</p>
<p>太奇特，太注目，這似乎是大家看見了圖中汽車後的第一個印象。問題是在二百立方尺左右的煤氣，實在除了這種圓型氣櫃之外，沒有地方再能容它「插足」。如果不採用用這種圓管型的式樣，另外還有一種篷型的方桶，可以容納煤氣，其原理完全一樣，所不同的就是式樣而已。</p>

<h3 id="c31">傀儡戲 <a href="#c31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>猶太人的新噱頭</p>
<p>該是十年以前的事吧！街頭巷尾往往圍着一大圈人，伸長了脖子在看「木人戲」。破舊的藍布圍成一個高可七八尺的戲台，沒有音樂節奏的鑼鼓聲從裏面透出來，一會兒，台上出現了舞着通天棒的孫行者，和拿著釘耙的豬八戒，藉着台後人的嘴爭論了起來，一好！打得好！」台下觀衆報以熱烈的鼓掌，同時將一二個銅子丢到當作錢盤的一隻破帽子裏去</p>
<p>可是時代的巨輪淘汰了這類帶有原始性的戲劇。舞台，戲館和電影院等像雨後春筍地倡設起來，人們所需要的是更深刻更動人的刺激，誰亦不願意站在街頭吃西北風看那些木偶的被人播弄了！</p>
<p>太平洋戰爭爆發以後，上海的娛樂界，尤其是電影院因爲國外交通斷絕，沒有新片輸入，似乎稍露出一些萎頓的神氣。電影，話劇等好像不再如以前那樣的够吸引人。在這種塲合下，「舊瓶裝新酒」，木偶戲又應運而起，但它並不上演在街頭巷尾，而在一個高尙的娛樂塲所，有高尙」的人士付出數百倍於一二個銅子的代價，帶着逸致的閒情，逍遙的神色，望着受人操縱的木偶發笑</p>
<p>一個原來僑居於奥國維也納的德籍猶太人高天冷（Gottlelein），被驅逐來到上海後，就和他的同志高天勃（Gottlieb），計劃在這裏的娛樂圈內，打出個木偶戲的世界。高天冷在歐洲時，曾導演過一部木偶戲的電影，獲得不少好譽。高天勃是木偶戲的技術家。他們兩個人在這裏經過了六個月的籌備，前兩天居然已成功了兩次的公演。</p>
<p>木偶戲最主要最引人注意的部份當然是「木頭人」，男女老幼一共有十個。頭用木雕刻製成，每一個臉孔代表一種表情，去配合劇情，喜怒哀樂都能顯現出來。手，臂，腿，脚各部用木和破布混合紮成。關節處能活動。衣服倒很考究，顏色的調和亦極悅目。每個高約十八英吋，假如把它放大到五六呎高，恐怕有人要盲目地認爲他們是眞人哩！</p>
<p>每個木偶的舉動，操在五根提綫上。不過在登台表演時，熄了燈光，一片黑暗，人的目光，不能看出提綫的存在，就很容易相信是有自由意志的自由人了！這就是噱頭！</p>
<p>戲台大約五呎長，三呎高，二呎半深。所有的佈景和道具精巧玲瓏，完全用手工製成。燈光的設計像話劇樣，襯托出臉上被雕刻出來的表情，讓觀衆充分欣賞它的美底價値。音樂的配合當然有助於演出效果的加强。</p>
<p>幕後的情形是這樣的，一個導演。一個負責道具，佈景，燈光的技師，一個玩着手風琴的女樂師。三男兩女是十個木偶的發言人，每個人要裝出兩種不同的聲調；他們捧着劇本讀台词，說，哭，笑，吵，不一而足。幕後最主要的角色是兩個牽綫的人。他們站在戲台後的高架上，　着腰，一邊聽對白，一邊憑他們二十隻手指指揮活動。祗要看到台上木頭人動作的活潑，運用手脚增强表情的本領，就可想到這兩個人對於木偶戲的技術確實高明。</p>
<p>昨前兩日在猶太總會公演的一劇叫做「暴發的農戶」是德國著名的舞台劇。據高天冷說，他們預備自編劇本。性質以喜劇爲主，還打算上演幾個戀愛劇</p>
<p>對白起初用德文。三星期後仍上演暴發的農戶「，改用英語。以後冉進一步採用華語</p>
<p>上海人祇喜歡噱頭。這就是一個新噱頭</p>

<h3 id="c36">交易旺銀根緊　紗市價市背馳驚人 <a href="#c36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>上週銀根緊，劃頭貼現率高至三百五十元；錢業拆息開做一角半，尤爲近年同期間罕見。依通貨數量說推論，此際物價應跌不應漲；現在適如其反。何以故？投機耳。投機旺，奇貨乃可居；於是物價漲。物價漲，投機益興奮，於是通貨需要增，銀根緊。銀根緊，拆息貼現率高翔，商貨負擔重，於是物價更漲。此一連環，必待物價高到無人問津與獲利多頭出籠之現象發生時，才能相反發展。</p>
<p>法幣需要增，外幣行市理應逆轉。今又適得反，其故乃由軍票翻騰爲中心。軍票行市，輒與發給薪餉時期相關。即月底發薪時市價小，月中開始回昇。過去歷月不爽。目前略有不同，即月底發薪前後，常因幣制變動等謠傳而大漲，其後步軟；中旬再起堅挺，蓋已由一變進爲三變。</p>
<p>物價漲風，常由紗布領導。今亦不例外。上週紗布暴漲，頻創新高峯。現貨廠單，各漲一千多出未曾有。市塲有限制上落幅度之說，用意良善。但限價政策，已被米蟲玩弄到令人談虎色變。限跌不限漲，印象尙新焉。</p>
<p>中外股票行市，現隨企業資產評進退，安全感已退居次位，雖屬怪現象，但確已成支配目前股市之普遍心理。惟債市一蹶不振，降跌慘厲。此與銀根吿緊有關。故其捲土重來之日，恐即其他投機目標遭遇逆風之時？</p>
<p>紗布果已具左右各市塲之魄力，售其最終關鍵，與其謂爲關係原棉，母寗謂爲關係南洋市塲之能否恢復？此路不通，原棉縱貴亦難維繫久囤。最近日商籌組南洋貿易組合，華紗布上漲又以藍鳳龍頭爲馬首，則其內容可知。然則籌組南洋貿易組合，並非即係南洋貿易恢復之謂也。</p>
<h3 id="c37">廠單追上現貨　紗布熾漲 <a href="#c37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>上海紗布市況，自前况，自前週　度慘跌後，又起激烈漲風；過程情形，異常複雜。全週浸於千變萬化之中，尤以二十支雙馬廠單，覆雲翻雨，獨自善變。現紗現布在投擲白熱化下，因亦扶搖直上。但實貨與賣空買空究屬有別，故走勢穩健。蓋紗市經前週回降後，引起有資者之購買；且空戶逢小抵補，脚地頓轉堅定；藍因原棉輸人杜絕，暗盤迭增，紗布成本高騰，而紡織廠牛產反趨减縮；致各方人心向上，重來收吸；兼之週中一部份金融界流出烚赤，套進棉紗；故紗布漲風再接再厲，一致創空前紀錄。二十支雙馬廠單，週五衝出六千元大關，最高竟達六千一百二十元高價；且交易運日極盛，漲落範圍甚大。週未尤爲熱烈。細紗細布，更屬尖銳；如三十二支金寳星及飛虎等俱已出一萬零八九百元；十六磅雙象粗布始終堅定於二百七十元左右。十二磅地球細布做二百冊七元，較前週復昇十餘元。</p>
<p>查自游資注入紗市，雙馬廠單替代戰前二十支金鷄躍而爲標準品後，已爲投機利器；近以申新紗廠停工，市上流通籌碼有限，更爲操業者所把持，因是市情起伏倐忽，洵非吾人得能想象。而布市與紗市原屬運繫，兩者顯具因果作用；故稍入循環期，即有新高峯發現；而其奔騰之狀况，範圍每見甚鉅。惟提拉過度，往往爲造成浮多出籠之機會；此種情形，在一般逐鹿於紗布市塲者，亦不得不加以注意。蓋上昇市面中亦有空頭因子；此與在下落市面中亦有多頭因子同；是種情形，猶待事實表演。</p>
<h3 id="c38">華股向榮　文化股最生色 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>上週華股市况，步趨向榮，脚地已臻鞏固。蓋自前週一面倒後，買戶乘低吸收不懈；實業股鋒鋩最健，大有供不敷求之概；投資者乃有另覓新籌碼者，於是新都飯店與藝林彩印，一經開做，購者爭先；此予工商業資金之調劑上，不失爲良好現象也。</p>
<p>上週股市蓬勃生色者爲文化業股，商業由二百十元昂至三百三十元，尙嫌籌碼短少。中華升十六七元，世界新股，週末巳穿出八十元關，高峯至八十二元許。藝林彩印，週五開做，即超過票面三十元間。百貨業永安最挺，升二元半。新新無甚軒輊。內衣漲跌互見，盤旋於廿五六元間。新藥業中法新股復出六十元關，最高至六十一元半。新亞新股疲乏，徘徊於三十六元上下；五洲藥房升五元，明星香水升七元許。新亞科學，市氣猛進；紡織業股大勢迂迴。金融業之中交兩行股，成交本暢，然週末已感閑散，價亦徘徊。大陸銀行挺升五十元，中一信托未見動靜。</p>
<h3 id="c39">外股追紗布　紡織股活躍 <a href="#c39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>外股市况，經遺老多頭不斷吐售，市價頻頻下降，已低至相當程度；至上週似有峯廻路轉之勢，掮客之輩，大爲活動；一般散戶亦躍躍欲試，並自葡商掮客公會才期貨市塲取消後，兩處交易已併在一地；故全週成交總數增至十六萬股光景。</p>
<p>上週有一特點；即沉寂已久夕橡皮類各股交易，忽見大旺，尤以週三及週四兩天最多，如地榜，克羅華及加侖丹等均有三千漲至一萬五千股之交易。乃因南洋戰事稍息，人心稍定，目實業各類股上漲已多，而橡皮各股仍在低峯，故又有引人入勝之處。至其他各股趨勢，因目前市價漲跌，無所依據，追隨棉紗；尤以紡織業各股步趨最緊。上週紗布暴漲，於是信和紗廠股軋漲三元一角；怡和紗廠股軋升一元半；其中上漲最勁者，當推中紡；自週一之十八元漲起，一路漲至週四之二十五元七角半；最後始略回至一十四元二角半，結果軋漲過四元之巨。公用事業類各股，仍推電車最俏；惟需過於供，故成交反稀，市價即喊近六十元之關邊，較前週約漲三元半。自來火及電話等亦然，價堅而成交少；獨公共汽車無人顧問。實業股中以鋼業及業廣兩種最爲活躍，其餘交易不多金融業各股更少交易。小額股中之紙業，怡和啤酒，及上海毛絨等，仍不失爲活躍份子，尤以毛絨交易最多，所漲亦較多。</p>
<p>目前外股之回漲，可視爲久跌後之反動；加以棉紗單子等猛漲，尤見激動掮客公會自卜週起已暫停週六交易，然上週六棉紗更見暴漲，則本週股市初期，將爲餘波所及，亦未可知。</p>
<h3 id="c40">債市風浪　散不如聚而覆 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>上週債市，又爲新貨拋躉所高壓，致市氣大衰，今回所拋之數，竟已超出過去數週所拋出之頭寸，今週成交總數約八百十餘萬元，而此路所賣者竟居半數以上。故各債有一面倒之勢，統乙已破人六十元關內，　度竟達五十五元一角；統甲亦曾破六十元大關，終復穿出：然各債均已發現去歲十二月八日後之新低價；如與前週最後價相較，又跌去二元九角至四元。</p>
<p>週一形勢甚穩，賣買雙方均無活動；週二賣方突以巨數一齊拋出，市况隨起變化；但買方進胃，亦殊驚人，大有如數吸盡之慨。由於非廉不拾，故市價難振；不過跌勢已因而稍戢。週三局勢參差，統甲統乙已見轉穩，其餘仍在續降中。此種情形，反映賣方聚而買方散，即買方擇肥而噬，故所吸雖多，然分散各手，故反抗力相對减弱，今後一方面尙須探知賣方餘貨尙有若干？及其性質緩急？另方面將視買戶脚地如何？作何處置？如臨陣脫逃，勢必發生對手困難，若緊持至最後，則峯回路轉，前途必天有可觀。</p>
<h3 id="c41">新籌碼淡期　軍票潛動 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>上週美金票一度盤低至三十一元六角，後仍逐步回升至三十二元九角左右，勢呈堅穩。香港票亦會破至四元六角，終又逼近五元關邊，此受軍票及金鎊價之影響也。蓋上週軍、票市勢，似在醞釀漲風，運日市上利多謠言，層出不已。除重彈儲備票提高掛牌之老調外，又有軍票可充銀行準備金之說；無非新籌碼淡期已屆，做多朋友又想活動一番；市價已自七元一角半升至七元四角半。究因空穴來風，不足爲恃，所以漲力極弱，過程頗多曲折；同時由於劃頭貼現率逐步高昂，現鈔行情拔開已有二角之多，故現鈔價仍在匕元一角半左右。不過投機者已寄以樂觀，因距離，薪日期尙遠，尙有飽展手腕之可能。然而目前情形，究不能與四月初取消四元比價時相比。</p>

<h3 id="c42">西洋題線傀儡戲 <a href="#c42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— 虛閣</p>
<p>傀儡戲即木偶戲，俗稱木人頭戲：若于年前，在廢曆新年期中，這種玩意兒，在上海街頭巷尾還是常常看得見。什麼猪八戒招親，　鬁頭相打等，許多小孩子都看得津津有味。近年來則已經很少看見了。</p>
<p>前星期六和三四幾天，靜安寺路猶太總會和虹口猶太人學校內，均有西洋傀儡的表演。大概的情形已見之於本報本埠新聞，這種新玩意兒確是値得一顧的。</p>
<p>提線傀儡戲在我國歷史上宋時已盛行之。即以上海而論，大約七八年前，以燈綵佈景號召的大提線戲，那時候演着連台好戲宏碧緣等，看過的人總還記得。所以提線戲在中國民間倒也是一個普遍的娛樂項目呢。</p>
<p>西洋提線戲在歐洲頗爲流行，尤其是德奥等國。這次猶太人總會內所表演的，那個導演高天冷，曾在德奥等國担任電影導演，具有三十多年的電影塲經　。我們總還記得德籍電影女名星麗琳哈蕙和雷門曾合演一齣以提線傀儡戲爲中心的戀愛劇，裏面有幾個塲面都是關於傀儡戲的。</p>
<p>西洋的傀儡，正像我們列子時代一樣的很早就有了。古時的埃及，和意大利中部古國愛脫羅利亞墓中，就已發掘到活動的傀儡。希臘人也有這種玩意兒，後來便輸入了羅馬。十七十八世紀中，歐洲各國都很流行傀儡戲，德國更爲木偶的集中地。大文學家哥德和勒新等，都認為這種娛樂是值得注意的。法蘭西小說兼戲劇家雷賽石曾編有傀儡劇本，專供當時的傀儡劇表演者應用。</p>
<p>英國的愧儡劇在十六世紀時也頗風行。其時劇本的題材多取之於聖經或民間流行的神怪故事等。像新約聖經出的浪子回頭，以及喬那和巨鯨等，均經　上提線戲的舞台。</p>
<p>即以上星期六猶太人齣愧儡戲而論，他們所選的一個劇本名爲　農人一，裏面的情節包括諷刺和喜劇的成分，尤其具有故事的素質。原劇爲奥國著名劇作家來門所作，在維也納舞台上連演了很久的日子。這次在上海用傀儡表演時，係由阿爾脫博士所改編。</p>

<h3 id="c43">閒話夏威夷羣島 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— 何柏華</p>
<p>翻開地圖你可以看見夏威夷羣島孤另另地立在太平洋中，它離開最近的大陸也達二千四百哩。現在已可確定最早的居民是於紀元五百年從南太平洋的塔希提島或薩摩亞島移來的。而且從此以後便與外界隔絕，直到一七七八年爲庫克船長所發現。</p>
<p>美國的傳敎團於一八二〇年到了夏威夷羣島便居定下來了，頗爲當地領袖歡迎。他們最初的一件工作便是敎導土著穿着衣服。因爲當時他們一絲不掛，白種婦女見了不禁驚駭大哭。</p>
<p>夏威夷羣島正式歸倂於美國版圖是美西戰爭時的事。杜威將軍攻下了馬尼拉以後，美國會認為夏威夷為太平洋中必須的停留處，及保衛美國太平一洋沿岸的重要據點。</p>
<p>夏威夷的居民是樂天的，他們愛好各種運勸。學校里秋天賽足球，春天玩壘球。網球塲上終年有人，無論男女老少。最爲流行的運勸是一種馬上球戲。</p>
<p>火奴魯魯是世界航空的中心。泛美航綫西飛的第一站即停於此。珍珠港爲著名海軍根據地，其上不時有軍用飛機巡遲操演。</p>
<p>火奴魯魯已完全美國化。土著已日漸减少，而夏威夷產的美國人却日見增多。政府組織及商業機關皆與美國相同。國籍不同的男女孩子現在都在一起讀書，遊戲，開玩笑。美國的風俗習慣，不論好壞，他們都加以模仿採用。</p>
<p>夏威夷最大的富源是糖，因爲氣候，土質，及各種環境皆有利於糖的生產。居民已用科學方法種植及提煉甘蔗。其次則爲菠羅多爲供裝罐頭之用。島上還生產咖啡與米。牧牛塲很多，所以牛肉甚覺。</p>
<p>珍珠港是海軍根據地，它是一個爲陸地所包圍的港口，入口甚狹。四周砲台堡壘密佈。足以容納全部美國艦隊。內有船塢及機械廠，力能勝任各項修理工作。</p>
<p>陸軍也有許多重要據點，最大的火奴魯魯西北二十哩的Schofield　Barracks。陸軍還負責「金鋼鑽頭一的防禦工作。同時在海陸合作軍之下他們建築了一個銅牆鐵壁似的奥胡島。說是百攻不破。</p>

<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（五）　拔來報往</p>
<p>話聲未絕，一個花白鬍子，被大門上一陣鼓樂迎進來。他站在中庭喊道：「張樹榮來啦，帳房在那裏？」厲乂榭一看，張樹榮左手挾了一個二藍綢幛，右手裏拿了兩隻箋扇莊的楹聯匣子和金字匣子。屬又榭走上一步喚他道：「張樹榮，你是給那一家送禮來的？帳房在那邊。」張樹榮道：「上海來的，姓陳，來弔喪的是一位少爺一位小姐，現在坐在我船裏。」</p>
<p>消息眞快，不一會，已經傳到孝幃裏。維城摘去了麻衣冠，只是一身平常的素服，趕到帳房裏看張樹榮。帳房在打開幛子的上下數來看，上軟是葉嫂厲太夫人仙逝，下款是侍生陳猶龍率子女國器國芳拜輓。維城看到國器字樣，問張樹榮：「陳少爺在那裏？」張樹榮道：「不但有陳少爺，還有陳小姐，他們坐在我船裏，等着葉少爺去接。」維城道：「船在那裹？快帶我去。你上來，怎麽不引導他們一塊兒上來？一　城才跟了張樹榮走到大門，陳國器兄妹己然淮門來。（七八）</p>

<p>Vichy, 16th (Havas) - Government Head Laval, at 5 PM this month, received reporters at his official residence in the Pack Building, announced the exchange of documents between France and the United States regarding Martinique Island, and made a brief speech. His tone was calm and resolute, stating: "Firstly, regardless of any unforeseen events, France will never abandon its sovereignty over its territories in the West Indies. Secondly, none of the warships or merchant ships in the French West Indies have fallen into foreign hands. Thirdly, Admiral Robert, as the government's official representative in the West Indies, is acting with the full authority granted by the government to negotiate with the United States, and is in complete agreement with the government. The Admiral will not make any decisions on his own without the government's permission." Subsequently, a reporter inquired whether the issue of disarming French ships on Martinique Island was involved. Laval replied that in fact, these warships had already been immobile before the current negotiations began. Another reporter inquired about Laval's trip to Paris yesterday. He replied that he would be going to Paris again in the near future, and that his visits to various areas of the occupied zone were solely for the purpose of realizing the plan he announced upon taking office.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 16th (Havas) - Regarding the Martinique Island issue, a German Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated to the press today: "France's reaction is the first step in the current international political situation, and Germany's reaction will be the second step." At this point, a reporter asked who would unveil the second step. The spokesperson immediately replied: "It could be a newspaper, a diplomat, or even a soldier."</p>
<h3 id="e2">Full Text of the U.S. Note <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Vichy, 16th (Havas) - The full text of the U.S. government's note of the 9th regarding the Martinique Island issue has now been officially released, as follows: "Since the Head of the French Government issued a declaration expressing his willingness to cooperate fully with Germany, the U.S. Government feels it can no longer be bound by the U.S.-French agreement of October 1940. This agreement clarified the legal status of French territories in the Western Hemisphere. According to the interpretation of this legal status, if there is any possibility of French territories in the Western Hemisphere becoming a base for Axis powers to attack the United States, the High Commissioner of France in the Western Hemisphere colonies should notify the United States of the intentions of the French government in advance, even if the High Commissioner changes. The situation has been satisfactory since the agreement was established, until now. However, in view of the current situation, it is expected that Germany will exert pressure on French territories that are obedient to Laval's orders. Such orders, in fact, cannot represent the free will of the French authorities. Therefore, if circumstances require, the U.S. Government is prepared to recognize the French High Commissioners of the French West Indies and French Guiana as the highest local authority, representing France under the French flag and free from Vichy's control. The U.S. Government specifically suggests the following measures: Effective measures should be taken, under U.S. supervision, to ensure that the French aircraft and warships currently on Martinique Island cannot move. U.S. authorities should manage wired and wireless telegraph communications and inspect mail. U.S. authorities should manage immigration matters. The number of French land and naval forces in the Caribbean Sea should be limited to the level sufficient to maintain public order. French merchant ships anchored in the West Indies should be made available to the U.S. government under fair terms. The gold and currency currently stored in the West Indies should be 'frozen' and handled by the French people in the future. In exchange, the U.S. government is willing to offer the following benefits: French warships may continue to fly the French flag, and their crews may remain on their ships. The U.S. government will make every effort to assist those who wish to return to France. The United States recognizes Admiral Robert as the highest administrative official in the West Indies, and the courts and civil institutions will continue to exercise their functions as usual. An economic agreement will be concluded to supply the French islands with essential food. The United States is willing to purchase the exports of the French islands to maintain their economic situation. A clear reply is required immediately regarding the provision that French aircraft and warships may not be moved. Replies to other proposals should also be submitted as early as possible through friendly consultation. In short, only if the French High Commissioner in the West Indies represents France in concluding a peaceful agreement can the territory and interests of the French territories in the Western Hemisphere be guaranteed. If the High Commissioner ceases to exercise his functions, the legal status of the aforementioned French territories will inevitably change, and the U.S. Government will no longer be able to guarantee the French people's control over the islands in the Western Hemisphere."</p>

<h3 id="e5">Contents of Vichy's Reply <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Vichy, 16th (Havas) - Regarding the French Martinique Island issue, the French reply was delivered to the U.S. government on the 13th, and its full text was released today. The main points are three: The French government opposes any U.S. demands that conflict with the armistice agreement or infringe upon French sovereignty. The French government is prepared to have Admiral Robert continue talks with U.S. representatives. The French government reiterates that it does not want to initiate a severance of diplomatic relations. The full text is translated as follows: Previously, when the United States had not yet entered the war in October 1940, an agreement was established between the U.S. and France to determine the status of all French territories in the Western Hemisphere. On May 9, 1942, U.S. Navy Department Representative Lieutenant General Hoover, accompanied by State Department Representative LeBelle, presented several demands to Admiral Robert, High Commissioner of the French West Indies, the nature of which would cause significant changes in the legal status of the French colonies in the Caribbean Sea. The various demands made have a great impact on French sovereignty in the West Indies. Lieutenant General Hoover also stated that if the demands made by the United States were not accepted, the United States would not be able to guarantee French sovereignty over the West Indies. The French position determined in October 1940 was originally established to protect the main rights of both parties, and in March of this year, both parties reiterated this. The French government has always respected its promises, and no matter how the government organization changes, it cannot change the attitude of the nation. As can be seen from the recent speech by U.S. Ambassador to France, Admiral Leahy, the Head of the French Government has never shown any intention of abandoning its promises, and has solemnly declared that he does not wish to take any action that would change the current friendly relations between the two countries. The French government opposes U.S. government interference in French internal affairs. The U.S. State Department expresses doubts about the sincerity of the French government's official statements, and the attitude it adopts is tantamount to insulting an independent country that has the right to choose its own government. The U.S. government has made a great psychological error, or has been influenced by French traitors who have fled overseas. France has maintained sovereignty over the West Indies for three hundred years. The recommendations made by the U.S. State Department would deprive France of this sovereignty. Admiral Robert's current powers are granted by the French government, and he is subject to the control of the French government. Now that the U.S. government is demanding that Admiral Robert report to another government, the French government has no choice but to refuse. The U.S. government is demanding that the merchant ships currently anchored in the ports of the West Indies be transferred to the United States. This kind of behavior is absolutely prohibited by the French-German armistice agreement. The government is not unaware of this. If the U.S. insists on its own way, in violation of the agreement, the consequences will be unimaginable. The U.S. government is demanding that the French warships currently in the ports of the West Indies not be moved, which clearly shows that the U.S. government is deeply concerned that these warships may be used to resist the United States. In fact, the U.S. government cannot put forward any military argument to justify this. Although the French government has never broken its trust, in order to make the situation absolutely clear, it is willing to reiterate that it will continue to respect all current agreements. The French government solemnly declares that it will not take any action that would affect U.S.-French relations. This statement is by no means false. Although the French government is bound by the French-German armistice agreement, it still has independence and freedom of action. The French government agrees to have Admiral Robert conduct negotiations, and is willing to consult on all proposals that respect the spirit of French sovereignty and neutrality. In essence, the French government is willing to determine the legal status of French territories in the Western Hemisphere, and is willing to guarantee to the United States that French warships and merchant ships will not be moved, but at the same time, the United States should also guarantee that it will never use these ships. France is currently working hard to rebuild in difficult circumstances, which the United States understands. If the U.S. commits an unreasonable act of violence, causing the friendship between the U.S. and France to break down, then the United States will bear a major responsibility in history.</p>

<p>Bombay, 16th (Havas) - Indian Mahatma Gandhi recently told the press: "The actions of the British are very distressing. Sir Stafford Cripps' method of operation when he was ordered to come to India previously has shocked me even more. Therefore, in good conscience, I cannot give Britain spiritual assistance."</p>
<p>Bombay, 17th (Reuters) - Gandhi published an essay in Harijan Weekly today, stating: "I ask every Englishman to support my appeal to the British to withdraw from Asian countries and African territories, at least from India, because this step is necessary to maintain world security and destroy Nazism and Fascism." It is said that if his appeal is accepted, it can shake all the military plans of the Axis countries. If my appeal is accepted, I dare say that the interests sacrificed by Britain in India and Africa are far less than its continued increase in war expenditure.</p>

<h3 id="e10">Germany and Soviet Union Transferring Reinforcements; Fierce Battles on the Kharkov Line; Intense Fighting on the Northern and Central Routes <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>London, 17th (Reuters) - According to a dispatch from a Reuters correspondent in Kuibyshev, the Eastern Front is a thousand miles long with intertwined trenches. The German and Soviet forces are now engaged in a major war. Although the situations in the areas of Kursk and Kharkov are attracting the most attention, the battles in other areas along the entire front are also strategically important. Since last month, the Red Army has been actively engaged in many areas, with the aim of reducing German strongholds in preparation for the spring offensive. This spring offensive is most critical on the southern route, but the battles around Leningrad and Kalinin on the northern route are also intense. On the central route, around Smolensk and Dorogobuzh, the German forces are very active. Fierce fighting is taking place around Bryansk. As for the guerrilla warfare behind the German lines, it is commanded by skilled leaders and is more organized than last year. The Soviet authorities are not indifferent to the food problem. This summer, all urban men and women across the country who are seeking to serve in military industries must be transferred to the countryside for farming. According to a dispatch from a Reuters correspondent in Moscow, the German army has transferred a large number of armored vehicles and mechanized reserve units to the Kharkov area in the hope of curbing the Red Army's offensive. The Soviet Air Force destroyed 60 German tanks and 130 vehicles in one day, but some still managed to reach the front line to reinforce the front-line troops, who are resisting fiercely. Although the fierce fighting has been going on for four days, the Red Army's offensive has not diminished in the slightest. The first German defense line has been largely broken through, and countless weapons have been captured, especially artillery, which is a characteristic of this Red Army victory.</p>
<p>Fighting Continues in the City of Kursk</p>
<p>London, 17th (Reuters) - Soviet troops are currently attacking German defenses around the city of Kharkov in Soviet territory. The Germans today claimed that the remnants of the Soviet forces on the Kursk Peninsula have been surrounded in a small area. Further reports received in London this afternoon regarding these two major battles were vague. The Soviet mid-day communique stated that on the night of May 16, fighting continued in the Kursk city area of the Kursk Peninsula, and the Soviet forces continued their offensive in the Kharkov area. There were no major events in the front-line areas. The Soviet supplementary communique stated that in the fighting around Kharkov, the German army suffered heavy losses in both manpower and equipment. One Soviet unit killed 500 German soldiers, captured 35 artillery pieces, and destroyed 15 tanks. Another Soviet unit captured a position, killing 900 soldiers and capturing a large number of war supplies.</p>
<p>German Headquarters, 17th (Haitong)</p>
<p>This afternoon, the German war report stated that in the northeast of the city of Kerch, the remaining enemy forces were forced to the eastern corner of the peninsula. The fleeing enemy forces suffered heavy losses due to bombing along the way. A major fire broke out in Taman, with explosions resounding in the distance. German fighter planes shot down 38 enemy planes in the north. In the Kharkov area, the Soviet army continued its offensive but was eventually defeated, suffering heavy losses. The number of tanks destroyed has reached 240. In other theaters in Eastern Europe, there was still artillery fire and reconnaissance activity. In the Moscow area and east of Lake Ilmen, important enemy railways were destroyed by German aircraft. The second company of the 132nd engineer battalion cleared 1,800 mines. On the Lapland and Murmansk fronts, our army is advancing smoothly.</p>
<p>Moscow, 17th (Reuters) - The Soviet official news agency stated that in the Battle of Sevastopol, 75,000 German soldiers were annihilated. The German army has been controlled by the Soviet army. In the past few days, the garrison has made several bold attacks, resulting in the capture of flat-trajectory guns, motorcycles, and other military supplies.</p>
<p>Germany Concentrates 20,000 Tanks</p>
<p>Moscow, 17th (Reuters) - According to reports, the Soviet army yesterday recovered some densely populated areas in the Kharkov front.</p>
<p>London, 17th (Reuters) - Hitler is concentrating a large army in the Kharkov area, preparing for his spring offensive, apparently intending to target the main bases of Kharkov, now under the command of General Moskalenko. According to information obtained by the Free French News Agency from German sources, the German army has been concentrating heavily in the area for the past ten weeks, preparing to use as many as 20,000 tanks.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 16th (Havas) - According to reliable Romanian sources, after the fall of Kerch, the Soviet Union's important base in eastern Crimea has been destroyed. However, fierce fighting is still taking place on the Kerch Peninsula, where the Red Army has suffered heavy losses. According to German estimates, more than 120,000 Red Army soldiers have been killed or wounded, and thousands have been captured. The Red Army is having great difficulty withdrawing from the peninsula. The only way to withdraw is by sea, but soldiers boarding ships will be subjected to heavy bombing by the German air force. As for the Red Army's pocket-shaped position in the Marienthal area, it has been annihilated. However, east of Kerch, near Yenikale, the main force of the Red Army is still holding out in the area between the railway line and the Sea of Azov. Yenikale is still in the hands of the Red Army, but it has lost its strategic value. In the Kharkov area, the Red Army is still maintaining its pressure. German and Soviet forces have been engaged in hand-to-hand combat in the Lipetsk area for 24 hours. The Red Army has also used tanks in the fighting. Although the Red Army has broken into the German lines, it is not enough to endanger the city of Kharkov. Both German and Soviet forces have transferred large numbers of reinforcements, and the most intense war is expected to occur today. In summary, the battle in the Kharkov area is personally commanded by General Timoshenko. In addition to distracting the German army, it is also intended to prevent the German army from attacking the Donets area.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Kharkov <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>The tank battle, which has been fought between Germany and the Soviet Union in the Kharkov area for days, has resulted in heavy losses on both sides, and can be described as unprecedented in history. Kharkov has a population of 833,000, and is the industrial center of Ukraine and a junction of the Soviet railway, so its location is very important. New industries include large-scale tractor factories, generator factories, and various machine factories. Before the war, this city had wide roads and modern buildings, but after this baptism of artillery fire, it is unknown what it has become.

<p>Swiss Capital, 16th (Havas)</p>
<p>The mystery of Germany's use of new weapons in warfare has been revealed in the Battle of the Kerch Peninsula. The most important new weapon is a new type of flat-trajectory gun, whose projectiles have a special shape and a very strong explosive force. If a tank is hit by one projectile, it will be destroyed without fail. Therefore, the German army no longer needs to use hand grenades to bomb tanks.</p>
<p>Moscow, 16th (United Press) - According to the "Clear the Fields" preparations, a 2-inch high-temperature projectile is ready for use. According to a "News Report" journalist, this type of projectile is the only weapon capable of destroying the Soviet "KV-type heavy tank. This tank is a product of the "Kirov" factory, which has now been moved from Leningrad to the east.</p>

<p>Marvaux, 16th (United Press) - Diplomatic personnel and journalists from warring countries exchanged. On May 2, U.S. officials and journalists in Italy arrived in Marvaux and transferred to Lisbon. According to international agreements, U.S. officials were escorted to Lisbon by six detectives wearing Fascist badges for surveillance. In the French territory, France also sent six detectives to escort the train for safety. When in France, the French were very polite and repeatedly asked when they would come again, and when they answered that they would come after the war, the French exclaimed to come quickly. This is the first time that journalists have been detained in Italy, Germany, and Hungary. The journalists waited a few days in Rome after the outbreak of the war before being sent to small towns for detention. Personnel from the Swedish and Norwegian embassies were still allowed to stay in Rome, but were forbidden from talking to Italians. However, embassy personnel were still able to move around and negotiate their own exchange. It is feared that this is the first time in modern history that diplomatic personnel have been able to play a role in enemy countries after the outbreak of war.</p>

In view of this "uncooperative" attitude, it can be seen that people do not want to contribute to wartime finance, but according to financial experts, foreign refugees should bear part of the responsibility for this.</p>

<p>The Jesuit fathers of the Catholic Church returned to China, and this year marks the centenary. During this century, they have made great contributions to Chinese culture. Father 山徐宗澤 has published an article titled "A General Overview of Jesuit Translations in the Past Century" in the April issue of this newspaper. Regarding the introduction of Catholicism into China, the world only knows that Matteo Ricci came to China at the end of the Ming Dynasty to promote religious doctrines, which have grown and prospered to this day. However, the influence of Catholicism on the Ming court is rarely recorded in historical documents. Now, Father Xu, based on the records of ancient priests, has compiled "Historical Materials on the Conversion of Empress Dowager Yongli of the Ming Dynasty and Others to Catholicism" and "The Ming Dynasty's Envoy to the Roman Curia," which are verified by historical books and are meticulously researched. They are not only valuable documents for Catholicism but also historical materials of great value. Father Xu's spirit of academic exploration is truly admirable!</p>
<p>Editor</p>
<p>Conversion and Civilization Began in the Chongzhen Era</p>
<p>At the end of the Ming Dynasty, there is one event in the history of Catholicism worth recording, namely the conversion of Empress Dowager Yongli and the empress to Catholicism. Earlier, during the reign of Emperor Chongzhen, civilization had already entered the palace. Eunuchs Pang Tianshou and Pu Lede were the first to convert to Catholicism (1632), and later many palace maids and concubines also converted. Two chapels were built in the palace, one for eunuchs and one for palace maids. In the thirteenth year of Chongzhen (November), Tang Ruowang presented images of the life of Jesus, and the emperor expressed deep faith. As the Zizhi Tongjian says, "The emperor, due to the many difficulties of the country, worried day and night, often silently prayed to God, and repented of his sins." The God mentioned here undoubtedly refers to the Lord of Heaven and Earth that Tang Ruowang spoke of. After Emperor Chongzhen viewed the images presented by Ruowang, it happened that someone urgently reported a shortage of military funds. Chongzhen did not hesitate to order all the gold and silver Buddha statues in the palace to be melted down to replenish the national treasury. As for the wooden Buddha statues, they were all burned. The bronze statues were cast into coins. The temples in the palace were converted for other uses, only leaving one temple for the lamas. At that time, rumors spread far and wide, saying that Emperor Chongzhen had converted to Catholicism. The "Brief Records of Emperor Lie" state: "In his early years, the emperor revered Catholicism. Xu Guangqi of Shanghai was a member of the church. After entering the government, he strongly promoted the theory of Catholicism and had all the bronze statues worshipped in the palace destroyed..." Unfortunately, the Ming court faced many difficulties. Although Chongzhen had faith, he was not baptized. Li Zicheng attacked, and he died tragically on Coal Hill. Ten years later, the Yongli imperial family converted to Catholicism.</p>
<p>Brief Biographies of the Three Meritorious Officials: Qu, Jiao, and Pang</p>
<p>Tracing back to the time when the bandits invaded the north, Chongzhen committed suicide. Zhu Yousong, the son of Prince Fu Changxun and the grandson of Emperor Wanli, then claimed the throne in Nanjing (the second year of Shunzhi), which was the first year of Hongguang in the Ming Dynasty. He was killed within a year, and Nanjing fell. Among the Ming Dynasty clan princes, Zhu Yujian claimed the throne in Fujian, changing the reign title to Longwu. In the eighth month of the second year of Longwu, he was captured by the Qing army. When this news reached Guangdong, Ding Kuichu, the Minister of War residing in Guangdong, and Shi Lang Zhai Shiyi supported Prince Gui Zhu Youlang to claim the throne in Zhaoqing, changing the reign title to Yongli. Emperor Yongli was twenty-six years old at the time. Yongli was the grandson of Emperor Wanli and the son of Prince Gui Changying. Yongli was content to rule over a part of the country for fifteen years, thanks to the meritorious efforts of Qu Shisi, Pang Tianshou, and Jiao Lian, who were officials who believed in Catholicism.</p>
<p>Qu Shisi, also known as Qitian and Jiaxuan, was from Changshu County, Jiangsu Province. He was born in the gengyin year of the eighteenth year of Wanli and became a jinshi in the bingchen year of the forty-fourth year of Wanli. He was appointed as the magistrate of Yongfeng County, Jiangxi Province. In the first year of Tianqi, he was transferred to Jiangling County, Hubei Province. In the first year of Chongzhen, he became a censor in the Ministry of Revenue. When Prince Fu ascended the throne in Nanjing, Shisi became the Right Vice Commissioner of the Nanjing Prefecture and the Right Vice Censor-in-Chief, patrolling Guangxi. In the first year of Yongli, Shisi was promoted to Right Vice Minister of the Ministry of Personnel, Grand Scholar of the Dongge Pavilion, and concurrently Minister of the Ministry of Personnel. In the second year, the Qing army captured Zhaoqing, and Emperor Yongli went to Guilin, and then to Nanning. In the summer of the third year, he returned to Zhaoqing. In the first month of the fifth year, he left Qing for Wuzhou again. Shisi was ordered to stay and defend Guilin. In the tenth month, the Qing army attacked Guilin. Shisi defended the empty city alone, sitting quietly and waiting for death. When the Qing army entered, they repeatedly tried to persuade him to surrender in order to preserve his wealth and status. Shisi refused to serve two surnames, calmly straightened his clothes and hat, bowed to the south, and was then killed. He was posthumously named Zhongxuan. Shisi received baptism at home in the third year of Tianqi (1623) under the guidance of Father Ai Xu, and his saint name was Thomas.</p>
<p>Jiao Lian, also known as Guoqi, was from Shanxi Province, or Nanjing according to one account. Because of suppressing the rebellion of Prince Jingjiang Wang Hengjia, he was promoted to the rank of general and was under the command of Qu Shisi. He guarded Guilin with Shisi and loyally served Yongli. Chen Bangchuan, a Ming traitor, invited Jiao Lian to surrender. Lian, because of his belief in Catholicism, did not dare to commit such an act of disloyalty and scolded Bangchuan for speaking nonsense. Bangchuan was angry and plotted to kill him, sending his head to the Qing army as a sign of surrender. Lian was fierce and worthy of sympathy.</p>
<p>Pang Tianshou was the Supervisor of Ceremonies of Emperor Yongli of the Ming Dynasty and held the supreme power of the military and the country. He was baptized in the fifth year of Chongzhen and his saint name was Achilles. In the fourth year of Yongli, he and Empress Dowager Yongli jointly wrote a letter to the Pope of Rome and the Superior General of the Society of Jesus, which was personally delivered to Rome by Father Xia Migue. Pang was loyal to Emperor Yongli and zealous in serving the Lord. He died in the twelfth year of Yongli, or according to another account, between the ninth and tenth years.</p>
<p>During the reign of Emperor Yongli, there were many other Catholics who served the Ming Dynasty and were loyal to the restoration of the Ming Dynasty, but unfortunately, their names were not passed down. The three officials Pang, Zhai, and Jiao were the main figures. With many Catholics around Emperor Yongli, the Yongli court was greatly influenced by Catholicism and had a tendency toward Westernization. The one who took the initiative was Pang Tianshou, and the one who carried out the work was Qu Ande KoffoerJS. The Apparition of Jesus and the Baptism of the Empress Dowager Qu Ande, with the courtesy name of Taitai, was an Austrian. He entered the Society of Jesus in 1627 and arrived in Macau in 1642. In 1645, he went to Wuzhou, Guangxi, to preach, and later to Zhaoqing. Pang Tianshou introduced him to Emperor Yongli. Father Qu presented tributes, as well as an image of the Virgin Mary holding Jesus with John standing beside them. At that time, Emperor Yongli was afraid of the Qing invasion and moved around不定. Pang persuaded the emperor, the empress dowager, the empress, and the concubines to kneel and recite the Our Father, the Hail Mary, and the Creed morning and evening to pray to God to protect the Ming Dynasty. The emperor carried out each of these practices. The empress dowager saw that the situation was becoming more and more pressing, and she was also very depressed. Her heart for seeking the truth grew day by day. One night, she was dozing off and could not close her eyes. Suddenly, she saw the Infant Jesus appear and said to her, "If you do not follow me, you will die." The empress dowager did not know what this meant. Soon, Father Qu Ande presented Emperor Yongli with an image of the Infant Jesus held by Saint Dan. When the empress dowager saw it, she realized that the Infant Jesus she had seen before was the Jesus held by Saint Dan. Therefore, her desire to convert became instant, but she still hesitated and could not make a decision about baptism. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e20">New Method for Selling Rice in Small Quantities Implemented Yesterday First Day of Implementation Purchase and Sale Executed as Usual, Queue Numbers Assigned Supply Situation More Universal Than Before <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the first day that the rice shops in the two concessions implemented the revised retail method of the Public Works Department. Although not all 372 rice shops in the two concessions sold bureau rice, the situation was still quite universal. The sales time was from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Some rice shops, in order to relieve congestion, also divided the sales into two sessions, morning and afternoon. Each rice shop continued to sell until all the rice they had purchased was sold out.</p>
<p>Order Still Good</p>
<p>The rice sold yesterday totaled over 10,000 bags purchased by the rice shops, so the supply was extremely universal. Before 8:00 AM, the police lined up the crowd for purchase and assigned numbers. After the rice shops opened, purchases were made in order. Most rice shops had temporary wooden fences or wire mesh at the sales point, leaving only a gap for one person to enter and exit, so the order was still good.</p>
<p>Strict Regulations The rice sold by the rice shops yesterday was allocated by the Public Works Department's Rice and Grain Management Committee on the 14th (Thursday). The rice shops had already taken it out of the warehouse to meet the door sales yesterday. Because the Public Works Department has strictly ordered the rice shops to designate the rice from the warehouse to be sold out on the specified date, the retail sales should be completed on the specified date, and no delay is allowed, otherwise, severe penalties will be imposed. Because the rice shops strictly follow the regulations of the Public Works Department for the date of delivery and retail sales, without any confusion, the supply situation will inevitably be universal and uniform.</p>

<p>The Public Works Department of the Public Concession held a special board meeting on Saturday, the 16th of this month, to approve the revisions to the service prices of the Shanghai Power Company, the Shanghai Water Company, and the Shanghai Gas Company. The revisions will be implemented from the 20th of this month in accordance with the methods stipulated in the announcements of the respective companies.</p>
<h3 id="e22">70,000 to 80,000 People Inoculated Against Epidemics Daily in the Two Concessions <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Public Concession Adds Another Inoculation Site Last Weekend On the 15th and 16th, the epidemic prevention movement in this port continued to advance, and the results were more satisfactory than before. The number of Chinese and foreign residents who received cholera vaccinations in the two concessions was extremely high, exceeding all expectations. In the Public Concession, 41,000 people were inoculated on the 15th, creating the highest record in recent years. In the French Concession, the daily number of inoculations was about 30,000. Due to the weekend holidays in the past two days, the inoculation work was temporarily stagnant. It can be carried out with all efforts in the next few days. The number of inoculations in the French Concession is also expected to break the record at that time. It is generally expected that the number of residents who have been inoculated in the two concessions will soon reach one million. According to the statistics of the health departments of the two concessions, nearly 700,000 people have been inoculated so far. If the daily number of inoculations in the two concessions still hovers between 70,000 and 80,000, then the total number of one million can be reached at the beginning of this week. The Public Concession Health Department, in view of the extremely crowded situation of residents requesting cholera vaccinations in the concession, especially at the two inoculation sites on Hankou Road and Fuzhou Road in the Central District, has added a free inoculation site at the North 每 Road Chinese Isolation Hospital in order to seek to relieve congestion. Cholera inoculations have already started on the 16th, and inoculation certificates will be issued at the same time.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Return Certificates Issued as Usual Yesterday <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>More than 7,000 Applications Daily The Public Works Department's Special Transit Permit Office for Going Home issued return certificates as usual yesterday, although it was Sunday, in order to facilitate evacuation. Since the office resumed issuing return certificates, the number of applications has been more than 7,000 per day, so the crowded situation is unprecedented. In order to relieve congestion, the issuance of application forms is temporarily interrupted when the number of people exceeds a certain number. After the people who have received the certificates leave one after another, the second issuance of application forms will be made.</p>

<p>A Disaster on the Way Home from School John Moring, a seven-year-old American elementary school student, was studying at Jeanne d'Arc School on Route Doumer in the French Concession. After school was dismissed at noon the day before yesterday, he planned to walk back to his home at No. 1248 Route Lafayette. Unexpectedly, when he walked to the intersection of Route Doumer and Avenue Joffre, just as he was about to cross Avenue Joffre, a French tram suddenly came head-on from about ten yards away. He panicked and did not know how to avoid it, and the tram crashed into him. The child was knocked down, and the tram stopped immediately. At that time, the Western child was lying in a pool of blood, dying. An ambulance was immediately called and sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. According to the hospital, the child's injuries were very critical, but there was still hope for recovery.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Numerous Rickshaw Theft Cases Occurred in Recent Days <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers Also Vanish Without a Trace Recently, there has been a sudden increase in the number of thefts of bicycles and rickshaws. This is due to the increase in the value of bicycles and rickshaws, which has promoted the large-scale activity of thieves. The frequent theft of bicycles is already a common occurrence, while the theft of rickshaws has only recently occurred. Here are two cases as a general overview, hoping that the owners of rickshaws will pay attention. Zhai Zhenhua, the owner of No. 132 Yougong Rice Shop on Route Comte in the French Concession, had his rickshaw stolen near the Public Works Department Building on Jiangxi Road in the Public Concession. Sun Linhai, the owner of Sun Linji Paint Shop at No. 2 Ping'anfang, Dajilu, Nanshi, had his rickshaw stolen in front of the Da Shanghai Hotel on Xiangfen Lane in the Public Concession, and the rickshaw puller also vanished without a trace.</p>

<p>The weather in Shanghai has been uncertain recently. The temperature was very high the day before yesterday, fully displaying the summer scene. People began to sit out in the open to cool off in the alleys. Yesterday morning, the weather changed suddenly, with a tight west wind and drizzling rain. It was cloudy all day long, which was abnormal. The climate was like that of late autumn. People wore cotton-padded robes. According to the records of the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau, the tides in the Huangpu River have been quite high in recent days. The amount of water reached 11 feet yesterday afternoon. The tides will be even higher next month. According to predictions, from June 1st to 5th, the amount of water will range from 12 feet to 10 feet and one inch. Low-lying areas of the road will see flooding.</p>

<h3 id="e29">Gas-Powered Cars <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>— Pei Gan</p>
<p>Because of the environment, Shanghai has become a gathering place for all kinds of unique vehicles. Moreover, Shanghai has always been a commercial port where people from all over the world gather, and new and strange things emerge one after another.</p>
<p>Taking bicycles and carriages as examples alone, all kinds of vehicles have sprung up in a short period of a few months, creating a grand spectacle. And there are still unknown numbers of them in the process of being designed and manufactured.</p>
<p>In addition to gasoline, diesel, charcoal, electricity, and gas can all be used for cars. However, in terms of the mechanism, it must first be transformed to adapt to the environment. The evolution of cars is just like that of carriages and bicycles.</p>
<p>The car in the picture has a large round tube on the front and back frames, which can be regarded as strangely shaped. As a joke, everyone's impression may be different. For example, the person who uses a pen thinks it looks like a large Parker pen; the person who pays attention to current affairs says it is like an anti-aircraft gun or a long-range cannon; the person who studies science always says it looks like the lens tube of a microscope; and the most often asked pharmacist may not say that it looks like a giant needle!</p>
<p>In fact, this is a genuine gas-powered car. Perhaps many people have seen it on the road. The style seems very strange, as if there is an extra horizontal chimney on the top of the car; in fact, the "life" of the whole car is in this simple round tube.</p>
<p>The car in the picture belongs to the Gas Company. There are three small letters "SGC" on the car door, which is the English abbreviation of the Gas Company.</p>
<p>The structural principle and installation engineering diagram of this kind of gas car will not be mentioned for the time being. Just talk about the gas tank on the top of the car, which can probably hold about 180 to 200 cubic feet of gas. According to Mr. Duanna, an engineer of the Gas Company, this more than 180 cubic feet of gas can probably be used for a journey of 12.5 to 13 miles.</p>
<p>The distance from the racecourse to the Bund is one mile. If you drive this kind of gas-powered car, it is more than enough to go back and forth five or six times after filling a tube of gas.</p>
<p>If the Gas Company is in Zhaoxiang Road (south of the new garbage bridge) No. 6600 and takes this kind of gas car to the Waibaidu Bridge, there is no need to worry about running out of "oil" in the four trips back and forth. If it is a long-distance trip, one "fill" of gas does not seem to be enough for it to travel. In the future, if there is a way to fill gas along the way, this difficulty can be solved.</p>
<p>Mr. J.K. Singpson, the chief engineer of the Gas Company, was the first designer of this gas-powered car. Although this car can now be driven on the road, according to the opinion of the company's engineers, the structure is not yet perfect, and some places are being improved. Therefore, it is not yet time to publicly install it for others. The ones that have been assembled, like the car with the notification number "9279" in the picture, are only for the use of the company's employees.</p>
<p>Having said that, if gas can be used in cars, then the many cars of all sizes that have been shelved in the car room can run on the road very lively once they are used in this way. In addition to the extravagant enjoyment of the fashionable ladies sitting in open cars in the summer to parade and enjoy the breeze, cars can actually save a lot of valuable time and manpower. If gas-powered cars can be used in practice, it may be good news for solving the transportation difficulties.</p>
<p>It is said that the Public Works Department of the Public Concession has entrusted several cars to the Gas Company to convert this gas equipment, and it is estimated that in the near future, the installed cars can be used in practice.</p>
<p>Too peculiar, too eye-catching, this seems to be the first impression that everyone has after seeing the car in the picture. The problem is that with about 200 cubic feet of gas, there is really no place to accommodate it "to set foot" except for this round gas tank. If you do not use this round tube-shaped style, there is another type of square bucket with a canopy that can accommodate gas. The principle is exactly the same, the only difference is the style.</p>

<h3 id="e30">Visit to the Poor Children's Arts and Crafts Institute Accommodates More Than 300 Poor Children Imparts Skills and Instills Knowledge <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the general charitable organizations in Shanghai have been deeply and greatly affected by the changes in the situation and the depletion of economic sources. This should be a concern for socially conscious people. However, the current situation is becoming more and more stable, and those who are compassionate and enthusiastic about doing good deeds are unclear about the actual situation of this kind of business and have no way to contribute. The reporter specially visited the Shanghai Poor Children's Arts and Crafts Institute, and Mr. Zhou of the institute gave a detailed account of the situation, which is briefly recorded as follows, so that people in the society can understand it and give sympathetic assistance.</p>
<p>Accommodating Poor Children and Imparting Skills</p>
<p>The Shanghai Poor Children's Arts and Crafts Institute was founded after the Shanghai War. It was first established on Dunxin Road in West Shanghai and is now moved to No. 99, Jessfield Road. All expenses depend on donations from all walks of life, which has been the case for several years. The institute accommodates about 310 poor children, employs several arts and crafts technicians, and teaches various small crafts so that they will have a skill in the future and be able to make a living. The institute is divided into rattan work, weaving, hairdressing, sewing, towel making, and other subjects.</p>
<p>New Workshop About to be Completed</p>
<p>According to Mr. Zhou, "Our institute was formerly located on Dunxin Road in West Shanghai. One reason was the inconvenience of transportation, and the second reason was the small size of the institute, which was not enough to live in. It was not until the end of last month that we moved here. However, this place was originally an old-age home, which was closed due to financial difficulties. Our institute moved in to live there. Although the exterior is a three-story洋房, the interior is in need of repair because the houses are old and the walls are badly damaged, and they need to be repainted. As for the poor children's dormitory, several thatched houses have been built with wooden floors inside, which have just been completed. The workshop buildings have not yet been built, and will probably be completed in about a month. It is now scheduled to formally work on various crafts on June 1."</p>
<p>Financial Difficulties Three Meals of Porridge a Day</p>
<p>The institute's monthly expenses are about 20,000 yuan, and the "food expenses" are about 600 yuan per day. There are only three meals of porridge a day made with rice and Gao粱 powder. Currently, part of the expenses is subsidized by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, and the shortfall is raised by the chairman of the board, Yuan Laitun, from the outside world. As for food, the Food Administration has promised to supply 40 bags of white rice per month, which is calculated at market prices. However, the entire institute has a population of more than 300, and needs about 70担 of white rice per month. The shortfall is to find other kinds of food for the people.</p>
<p>Clothing Difficulties Urgent Appeal for Donations</p>
<p>As for the clothing level, it is a serious problem. In the future, each person will be given a set of clothes, but now even clothing materials such as domestic products are as expensive as silk and satin. Although we have tried our best to appeal to all walks of life, we have received assistance with clothing materials from several public associations. However, the population is large, and I am afraid that there are too many monks and too little porridge, which is not enough to distribute. We sincerely hope that enthusiastic ladies will give old clothes, trousers, quilts, shoes, socks, etc. to the children as much as possible so that the hundreds of white-skinned children will not be exposed to the cold.</p>
<p>Opening of Free School Part-Work Part-Study</p>
<p>Moreover, the institute is now planning to open a free primary and secondary school, a complete primary school system, up to the second year of high school, to provide them with appropriate education and irrigation knowledge, and adopt a part-work part-study system to cultivate talents. If there is a surplus, poor children outside the institute can also come to the institute to learn. However, it must be confirmed that they are poor and unable to enroll, and must be certified by various charities by letter. The plan has been submitted to the board of directors and will probably be realized in the autumn.</p>
<p>Lost Children Hope to be Claimed</p>
<p>The reporter saw many difficult children with disheveled hair and bare feet crouching beside the escalator. According to Mr. Zhou, these difficult children are about 20 in number and were sent by the police station after being lost on the road. They range in age from six to sixteen. The frequent addition of these difficult children to the institute is a major expense. If there are children who are lost on the roads of West Shanghai, they can go to the institute to claim them.</p>
<p>Qian Juntao's Calligraphy, Painting, and Seal Carving</p>
<p>The writer, calligrapher, painter, and seal carver Qian Juntao has long been famous in the art world. Most of the book covers published by major bookstores are from his handwriting. He has deep skills in calligraphy, painting, and seal carving, and the literati admire him. It is heard that he has recently revised the direct example to widely form ink ties. If you want Qian's handwriting and stone carving, you can contact the major stationery, fan, printing, and bookstore in this port.</p>
<p>New Goods of Handball Cigars on the Market</p>
<p>Ten-pack handball cigars, with superior quality and mellow aroma, are sold all over the world and have always been loved by Chinese and foreigners. In the face of rising cigarette prices, they are especially regarded as the only economic cigar. Because they have been out of stock for a long time, there has been no way to buy them on the market. Now new goods have arrived, so the major companies and cigarette shops in this port have resumed normal supply. The sales have been quite smooth after a long time of interruption. It is heard that in order to prevent hoarding and curb price increases, the manufacturer is exercising control over wholesale peers. Yesterday's broadcast time was 6:15.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Puppet Show <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>A New Gimmick from the Jews</p>
<p>It must have been about ten years ago! The streets and alleys were often surrounded by large circles of people, craning their necks to watch the "Wooden Man Show." A tattered blue cloth formed a stage seven or eight feet tall, with the sound of gongs and drums, devoid of musical rhythm, coming from within. After a while, Sun Wukong, wielding his Ruyi Jingu Bang, and Zhu Bajie, holding his rake, appeared on the stage, arguing with the voices of people behind the stage. "Bravo! Good fight!" The audience below responded with enthusiastic applause, simultaneously throwing one or two copper coins into a broken hat used as a coin plate.</p>
<p>However, the giant wheel of the times has淘汰淘汰ed this type of primitive drama. Stages, theaters, and cinemas have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a rain, and people need more profound and moving stimulation. No one wants to stand on the street, exposed to the cold wind, watching those puppets being manipulated by others!</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the entertainment industry in Shanghai, especially the cinemas, seemed to show some signs of fatigue because foreign transportation was cut off and no new films were imported. Movies, dramas, etc., no longer seemed as attractive as before. Under these circumstances, "old wine in new bottles," puppet shows have emerged again, but they are not performed on the streets and alleys, but in an upscale entertainment venue, where "upscale" people pay hundreds of times the price of one or two copper coins, with leisurely interest and a carefree expression, laughing at the puppets being manipulated.</p>
<p>A German Jew named Gottlelein, who originally lived in Vienna, Austria, was expelled and came to Shanghai. He and his comrade Gottlieb planned to create a world of puppet shows in the entertainment circle here. In Europe, Gottlelein had directed a puppet show film that received much praise. Gottlieb is a puppet show technician. After six months of preparation, the two of them have successfully performed two public performances in the past few days.</p>
<p>The most important and eye-catching part of the puppet show is, of course, the "Wooden People." There are ten of them in total, including men, women, old and young. The heads are carved from wood, and each face represents an emotion to match the plot, showing joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness. The hands, arms, legs, and feet are made of wood and rags. The joints are movable. The clothes are very elaborate, and the color coordination is extremely pleasing to the eye. Each is about eighteen inches tall. If they were enlarged to five or six feet tall, some people might blindly think they were real people!</p>
<p>Each puppet's movements are controlled by five strings. However, when performing on stage, the lights are turned off, and in the darkness, people's eyes cannot see the existence of the strings, so it is easy to believe that they are free people with free will! That's the gimmick!</p>
<p>The stage is about five feet long, three feet high, and two and a half feet deep. All the scenery and props are exquisitely made entirely by hand. The lighting design is like a drama, highlighting the carved expressions on the face, allowing the audience to fully appreciate its beauty and value. The musical accompaniment, of course, helps to enhance the performance effect.</p>
<p>The situation behind the scenes is as follows: a director, a technician in charge of props, scenery, and lighting, and a female musician playing the accordion. Three men and two women are the spokespersons for the ten puppets, and each person has to imitate two different tones. They hold the script and read the lines, speaking, crying, laughing, and arguing endlessly. The most important roles behind the scenes are the two people who pull the strings. They stand on a high架架 behind the stage, bending over, listening to the dialogue while using their twenty fingers to control the movements. As long as you see the lively movements of the wooden people on the stage and their ability to enhance expressions with their hands and feet, you can imagine that these two people are indeed highly skilled in puppet show techniques.</p>
<p>The play performed at the Jewish General Assembly the day before yesterday, called "The Newly Rich Farmer," is a famous German stage play. According to Gottlelein, they plan to write their own scripts, mainly comedies, and also plan to stage several love stories.</p>
<p>The dialogue was initially in German. Three weeks later, "The Newly Rich Farmer" will still be performed, but it will be changed to English. Later, they will take a further step and use Chinese.</p>
<p>Shanghai people only like gimmicks. This is a new gimmick.</p>

<p>The track and field competition between the French Police, French Army, and French Business teams was held at the American Children's Corner a few days ago. The Temporary French Concession Fire Brigade joined, forming a four-corner competition. As a result, the French Police relied on their large number of talents and won first place with 42 points. The French Army was runner-up with 17 points. The French Business team ranked third with 15 points. The Fire Brigade only got one point and was last. Yu Liming, a Chinese general representing the French Police, won the 100-meter championship with a score of 11.2 seconds, which is very commendable.</p>

<h3 id="e36">Active Transactions, Tight Money Supply - Startling Divergence Between Yarn Market Price and Value <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Last week, the money supply was tight, and the discount rate for drafts was as high as 350 yuan. The interbank lending rate opened at 15%, which is rare for the same period in recent years. According to the theory of the quantity of currency, prices should fall rather than rise at this time; now it is just the opposite. Why? Speculation. With active speculation, scarce goods can be hoarded; thus, prices rise. As prices rise, speculation becomes more excited, so the demand for currency increases, and the money supply tightens. As the money supply tightens, interbank lending rates and discount rates soar, and the burden on merchants increases, so prices rise even further. This chain reaction will only reverse when prices are so high that no one is interested and many profit-takers unload their goods.</p>
<p>As the demand for 法幣 法幣 increases, foreign exchange rates should reverse. Now it is just the opposite, which is due to the turmoil in military scrip. The military scrip exchange rate is always related to the period when salaries are paid. That is, the market price is low at the end of the month when salaries are paid, and starts to rise in the middle of the month. This has been consistent in the past months. Currently, it is slightly different, that is, around the end of the month before and after the salary payment, there is often a large increase due to rumors of currency system changes, etc., and then it softens; in the middle of the month, it rises again, which has changed from one to three.</p>
<p>The price increase trend is often led by yarn and cloth. This time is no exception. Last week, yarn and cloth soared, frequently reaching new highs. The spot factory orders each rose by more than a thousand, which has never happened before. The market has a saying about limiting the range of price fluctuations, and the intention is good. However, the price limit policy has been manipulated by 米蟲 米蟲 to the point where people turn pale at the mention of it. The impression of limiting the decline but not limiting the increase is still fresh.</p>
<p>The market prices of Chinese and foreign stocks now rise and fall with the evaluation of corporate assets, and the sense of security has retreated to second place. Although this is a strange phenomenon, it has indeed become the general psychology dominating the current stock market. However, the bond market is in a slump, with a sharp decline. This is related to the tight money supply. Therefore, the day of its comeback may be when other speculative targets encounter headwinds?</p>
<p>If yarn and cloth already have the power to influence various markets, then the final key lies in whether the South Seas market can be restored, rather than being related to raw cotton. If this path is not open, even if raw cotton is expensive, it will be difficult to maintain long-term hoarding. Recently, Japanese businessmen have organized a South Seas Trade Association, and the rise in Chinese yarn and cloth has been led by the Lan Feng brand, so its content is clear. However, organizing a South Seas Trade Association does not mean that South Seas trade has been restored.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Factory Orders Catch Up with Spot Prices - Yarn and Cloth Soar <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai yarn and cloth market, since the disastrous fall the previous week, has started a fierce price increase trend again. The process is extremely complex. The whole week was immersed in constant changes, especially the 20-count Double Horse factory orders, which were changeable and unpredictable. As spot yarn and cloth were thrown into a white-hot state, they also rose sharply. However, spot goods are different from short selling and long buying, so the trend is stable. After the decline in the yarn market the previous week, it attracted purchases from those with capital; and short sellers made small compensations, and the foundation turned firm. Because the import of raw cotton has been cut off, dark盘盘 have repeatedly increased, the cost of yarn and cloth has soared, and the production of textile factories has tended to shrink; so all parties are optimistic and re-absorbed. In addition, during the week, some financial circles flowed out of the 烚烚, 套進棉紗 套進棉紗; so the yarn and cloth price increase trend continued to create an unprecedented record. The 20-count Double Horse factory orders broke through the 6,000 yuan mark on Friday, reaching a high price of 6,120 yuan; and the volume of transactions was extremely high, with a very large range of fluctuations. The weekend was especially hot. Fine yarn and fine cloth were even more sharp; such as 32-count Jinbao Star and Flying Tiger, etc., have all exceeded 10,8900 yuan; 16-pound Double Elephant coarse cloth has always been firm at around 270 yuan. 12-pound Earth fine cloth was priced at 207 yuan, an increase of more than ten yuan from the previous week.</p>
<p>Since the injection of游资 into the yarn market, the Double Horse factory orders have replaced the pre-war 20-count Golden Rooster as the standard product and have become a speculative tool; recently, due to the suspension of production at the Shenxin Yarn Factory and the limited number of chips circulating on the market, they are more controlled by operators. Therefore, the market situation fluctuates suddenly, which is beyond our imagination. The cloth market and the yarn market are originally linked, and the two have a clear causal effect; so as soon as they enter a cycle, a new high peak is found; and the state of their galloping, the scope is often very large. However, excessive提拉提拉 often creates opportunities for浮多出笼浮多出笼; this situation must also be paid attention to by those who are generally competing in the yarn and cloth market. There are also short factors in the rising market; this is the same as there are also long factors in the falling market; this situation remains to be seen in fact.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Chinese Stocks Prosper - Cultural Stocks are the Most Colorful <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Last week, the Chinese stock market trended towards prosperity, and the foundation has become solid. Since the one-sided倒倒 the previous week, buyers have been absorbing at low prices tirelessly; industrial stocks have been the strongest, and there is a general shortage of supply; investors have to look for new chips, so as soon as the New Capital Hotel and Yilin Color Printing opened, buyers competed to buy; this is a good phenomenon in the adjustment of industrial and commercial funds.</p>
<p>Last week, the most prosperous stocks in the stock market were cultural industry stocks. Commercial rose from 210 yuan to 330 yuan, and there were still too few chips. China rose 167 yuan, and the World new stock broke through the 80 yuan mark on the weekend, reaching a peak of about 82 yuan. Yilin Color Printing, which opened on Friday, exceeded the par value of 30 yuan. In the department store industry, Wing On was the strongest, rising 2.5 yuan. Sincere had little change. Underwear saw mixed gains and losses, hovering between 256 yuan. In the new pharmaceutical industry, the Sino-French new stock returned to the 60 yuan mark, reaching a maximum of 61.5 yuan. The New Asia new stock was weak, hovering around 36 yuan; the Wuzhou Pharmacy rose 5 yuan, and the Star Perfume rose about 7 yuan. New Asia Science's market atmosphere was fierce; textile industry stocks generally meandered. Among the financial industry's Sino-Japanese two banks stocks, the transaction volume was smooth, but it felt idle on the weekend, and the price also hovered. The Continental Bank rose sharply by 50 yuan, and the China One Trust showed no movement.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Foreign Stocks Follow Yarn and Cloth - Textile Stocks Active <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>The foreign stock market, after the continuous selling by the old多头, the market price has fallen frequently, and has been low to a considerable degree; last week, it seemed to have a turning point, and the brokers were very active; the general retail investors were also eager to try, and since the Portuguese Chamber of Brokers期货期货 market was cancelled, the two places of transaction have been merged into one place; so the total number of transactions in the whole week increased to about 160,000 shares.</p>
<p>There was a special feature last week; that is, the trading of rubber stocks that had been silent for a long time suddenly became prosperous, especially on Wednesday and Thursday, such as Di Bang, Crowe Hua and Galen Dan, etc., all had transactions of 3,000 to 15,000 shares. This is because the war in the South Seas has eased slightly, people's hearts have settled slightly, and the prices of various industrial stocks have risen a lot, while the rubber stocks are still at a low peak, so they are also attractive. As for the trend of other stocks, because the current market price rises and falls without any basis, it follows cotton yarn; especially the textile stocks follow the most closely. Last week, cotton yarn soared, so the Xinhuo Yarn Factory stock rose by 3.1 yuan; the Jardine Yarn Factory stock rose by 1.5 yuan; among them, the most powerful increase was China Textile; it rose all the way from 18 yuan on Monday to 25.75 yuan on Thursday; finally it slightly returned to 14.25 yuan, resulting in a huge increase of over 4 yuan. In the public utility sector, the tram is still the most popular; however, the demand exceeds the supply, so the transaction volume is rare, and the market price is close to the 60 yuan mark, an increase of about 3.5 yuan from the previous week. The same is true for tap water and telephone, with firm prices and few transactions; only public buses are not consulted. Among industrial stocks, steel and Guangye are the most active, and there are few other transactions, and there are even fewer transactions in financial stocks. Among the small-cap stocks, paper, Jardine Beer, and Shanghai Woolen are still active, especially woolen has the most transactions and the most gains.</p>
<p>The current rebound of foreign stocks can be regarded as a reaction after a long fall; in addition, cotton yarn orders, etc., have risen sharply, especially exciting. The Chamber of Brokers has temporarily suspended Saturday trading since the week, but last Saturday cotton yarn rose even more sharply, so the initial stage of the stock market this week will be affected by the aftershocks, which is not known.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Bond Market Storm - Better to Gather Than Scatter and Capsize <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Last week, the bond market was again highly pressured by the dumping of new goods, resulting in a great decline in the market atmosphere. The number of stocks dumped this time has exceeded the positions dumped in the past few weeks. The total transaction volume this week was about 8.1 million yuan, and those who sold this way accounted for more than half of the total. Therefore, each bond has a one-sided trend. Tongyi has broken within the 60 yuan mark, and once reached 55.1 yuan; Tongjia has also broken the 60 yuan mark, and finally broke out again: however, each bond has found a new low price after December 8 last year; compared with the last price of the previous week, it has fallen by 2.9 yuan to 4 yuan.</p>
<p>The situation was very stable on Monday, and there was no activity on both the buying and selling sides; on Tuesday, the selling side suddenly threw out a large number of stocks, and the market situation changed accordingly; however, the appetite of the buying side was also amazing, and there was a general feeling that they would absorb all of them. Because they would not pick up anything unless it was cheap, the market price was difficult to rise; however, the downward trend has been slightly restrained as a result. The situation was mixed on Wednesday, and Tongjia and Tongyi have seen a turning point, while the rest are still continuing to decline. This situation reflects that the sellers are gathered and the buyers are scattered, that is, the buyers choose the fat and eat it, so although they absorb a lot, they are scattered in various hands, so the resistance is relatively weakened. In the future, on the one hand, we must find out how many remaining goods the sellers still have? And its nature and urgency? On the other hand, we will see how the buyers stand and what they will do? If they desert at the last minute, there will inevitably be difficulties for the opponent, but if they hold on to the end, then the peak will turn around, and the future will be promising.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Slack Season for New Chips - Military Scrip Undercurrents <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Last week, the US dollar bill once fell to a low of 31.6 yuan, and then gradually rose back to about 32.9 yuan, showing a firm and stable trend. The Hong Kong bill also broke to 4.6 yuan, and finally approached the 5 yuan mark, which was affected by the price of military scrip and gold pounds. Last week, the military and scrip market seemed to be brewing a price increase trend, and many rumors of bullishness on the market were endless. In addition to repeating the old tune of raising the listing price of reserve tickets, there is also the saying that military scrip can be used as bank reserves; nothing more than the slack season for new chips has arrived, and more friends want to be active again; the market price has risen from 7.15 yuan to 7.45 yuan. After all, it is unfounded, so the upward force is extremely weak, and the process is quite tortuous; at the same time, due to the gradual increase in the discount rate for drafts, the spot price has opened up by as much as 20%, so the spot price is still around 1.15 yuan. However, speculators have been optimistic, because the salary date is still far away, and there is still the possibility of fully developing their skills. However, the current situation cannot be compared with the cancellation of the 4 yuan parity price in early April.</p>

<h3 id="e42">Western String Puppet Show <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Ge</p>
<p>Puppet shows, also known as puppet shows, are commonly known as wooden head shows: until a few years ago, during the period of the old lunar New Year, this kind of thing was often seen on the streets and alleys of Shanghai. Zhu Bajie's marriage招親 and 鬁頭的相打, many children enjoyed watching them. In recent years, they have rarely been seen.</p>
<p>Last Saturday and the past three or four days, there were Western puppet performances at the Jewish General Assembly on Jing'an Temple Road and the Jewish School in Hongkou. A general description has been seen in the local news of this newspaper, and this new thing is indeed worth a look.</p>
<p>String puppet shows were popular in China during the Song Dynasty in history. Taking Shanghai as an example, about seven or eight years ago, the large string puppet show, which was known for its lantern decorations, was performing a series of good plays, such as Hong Bi Yuan, etc., and those who have seen it still remember it. Therefore, string puppet shows are also a common entertainment item in Chinese folk culture.</p>
<p>Western string puppet shows are quite popular in Europe, especially in Germany and Austria. The director of the performance at the Jewish General Assembly this time, Gao Tian Leng, has been a film director in Germany and Austria and has more than 30 years of experience in the film industry. We still remember the German film actress Lili Lianha Hui and Lei Men who co-starred in a love drama centered on a string puppet show, and there were several scenes about puppet shows.</p>
<p>Western puppets have existed as early as our Liezi era. In ancient Egypt and the tombs of the ancient country of Etruria in central Italy, movable puppets have been excavated. The Greeks also had this kind of thing, and later it was imported into Rome. In the 17th and 18th centuries, puppet shows were very popular in various European countries, and Germany was the concentration of puppets. Great writers such as Goethe and Lessing all believed that this kind of entertainment was worth paying attention to. The French novelist and playwright Le Serre de Rieux has compiled puppet scripts specifically for puppet show performers at that time.</p>
<p>English puppet plays were also very popular in the sixteenth century. At that time, the themes of the scripts were mostly taken from the Bible or popular mythical stories. For example, the Prodigal Son from the New Testament Bible and Jonah and the Great Whale have all been on the stage of string puppet shows.</p>
<p>Taking the Jewish puppet show last Saturday as an example, the script they chose was called 农民 Farmers I, and the plot included satire and comedy, and especially had the quality of a story. The original play was written by the famous Austrian playwright Rémond and was performed on the Vienna stage for a long time. When it was performed in Shanghai with puppets this time, it was adapted by Dr. Altuo.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Chatting about the Hawaiian Islands <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— He Bohua</p>
<p>If you open a map, you can see the Hawaiian Islands standing alone in the Pacific Ocean, as far as 2,400 miles from the nearest continent. It is now certain that the earliest inhabitants migrated from the South Pacific islands of Tahiti or Samoa in 500 AD. And from then on, they were isolated from the outside world until Captain Cook discovered them in 1778.</p>
<p>American missionaries arrived in the Hawaiian Islands in 1820 and settled down, and were welcomed by local leaders. Their first task was to teach the natives to wear clothes. Because at that time they were stark naked, and the white women couldn't help but cry in shock when they saw them.</p>
<p>The Hawaiian Islands were officially annexed into the territory of the United States during the Spanish-American War. After General Dewey captured Manila, the United States believed that Hawaii was a necessary stop in the Pacific and an important base for defending the Pacific coast of the United States.</p>
<p>The residents of Hawaii are optimistic, and they love all kinds of sports. In schools, they play soccer in the fall and softball in the spring. There are people on the tennis courts all year round, regardless of men, women, old or young. The most popular sport is a kind of polo.</p>
<p>Honolulu is the center of world aviation. The first stop of the Pan American route west is here. Pearl Harbor is a famous naval base, and military aircraft patrol and drill on it from time to time.</p>
<p>Honolulu has been completely Americanized. The natives have gradually decreased, but the Americans produced in Hawaii have increased day by day. Government organizations and commercial institutions are the same as those in the United States. Boys and girls of different nationalities now study, play, and joke together. American customs, whether good or bad, are imitated and adopted by them.</p>
<p>Hawaii's greatest wealth is sugar, because the climate, soil, and various environments are conducive to sugar production. Residents have used scientific methods to plant and refine sugar cane. The second is pineapple, which is used for canning. The island also produces coffee and rice. There are many cattle牧牛塲, so beef is very expensive.</p>
<p>Pearl Harbor is a naval base, and it is a harbor surrounded by land with a very narrow entrance. The surrounding砲台bastions are densely populated. Enough to accommodate the entire U.S. fleet. There are docks and machine shops inside, which can handle various repair work.</p>
<p>The army also has many important strongholds, the largest of which is Schofield Barracks, twenty miles northwest of Honolulu. The army is also responsible for the defense work of Diamond Head. At the same time, under the joint military cooperation of the sea and land, they built an copper wall and iron bastion-like Oahu Island. It is said to be impenetrable.</p>

<h3 id="e45">Puppet Orchestra <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiao</p>
<p>Recently, this newspaper reported that a Westerner-organized puppet theater troupe performed at a certain general assembly, and the results were good. This kind of puppet show probably comes from the West. The picture shown here is a puppet orchestra, complete with conductor, singer, band members, and instruments. Naturally, the music is not produced from the puppet instruments, but is emitted from the gramophone under the stage. But, it is indeed very realistic. This team of puppets was made by a craftsman from Philadelphia, and the products include puppet heads, wood chips, metal wires, cloth and other scraps. The instruments are made of dentists' drills and tin cans, etc. The exquisite skills are truly amazing.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Sharing the Same Boat in Storms <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— By He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(5) Reciprocity</p>
<p>Before the words had finished, a man with a floral white beard was welcomed in by a burst of drums and music at the main gate. He stood in the courtyard and shouted, "Zhang Shurong is here! Where is the accounts office?" Li Yixie saw that Zhang Shurong was carrying a two-tone blue silk banner in his left hand, and in his right hand were two couplet boxes and gold-lettered boxes from the letter paper shop. Shu Youxie stepped forward and called to him, "Zhang Shurong, which family are you delivering gifts to? The accounts office is over there." Zhang Shurong said, "From Shanghai, surnamed Chen. The people here to offer condolences are a young master and a young lady, and they are currently sitting in my boat."</p>
<p>The news traveled quickly. In no time, it had already reached the mourning hall. Weicheng removed his hemp mourning cap, wearing only plain clothes, and hurried to the accounts office to see Zhang Shurong. The accountant was opening the banner and counting up and down. The upper section said: "The late Madam Li, wife of Ye, has passed away." The lower section read: "Respectfully offered by student Chen Youlong, with children Guoqi and Guofang." When Weicheng saw the name Guoqi, he asked Zhang Shurong, "Where is Young Master Chen?" Zhang Shurong said, "Not only is Young Master Chen here, but also Miss Chen. They are sitting in my boat, waiting for Young Master Ye to pick them up." Weicheng said, "Where is the boat? Take me there quickly. Why didn't you guide them up here when you came? "Only then did Yicheng follow Zhang Shurong to the gate, where the Chen Guoqi siblings had already come to the gate. (7-8)</p>
