<h3>夏季的防疫　時疫發生多由飮食不愼強健腸胃自可減少染患</h3>
<p>那厭人的蒼蠅，飛滿了人間，由於它們的來往逐飛，就處處的埋伏了人生的危機。最重要的腸疾病，有：痢疾，腸傷寒等症，偶一不愼，就會被它們把生命剝奪了去的。所以傳染到這種病症的緣故，大多由於飲食的不愼，把這種種，痢疾菌啦，傷塞菌啦！帶到腸裹去，才給它們機會，在人身體中繁殖猖狂起來了，它們的症狀，簡單的寫在下面一點「霍亂」普通稱為虎列拉，是一種最可怕的流行症，可能在很短時期結束了人的生命！輕的只不過吐瀉幾回，頭覺着疼或暈，身體微倦，四肢較冷，約一週卽可痊愈，而重者則每以致命，嘔吐及排洩劇甚，眼窩下凹，指螺下陷，面蒼白，口喝，聲低啞，痙攣等態。但身體衰弱的人，多生此病，假若服了强身補血的「若素」體格强健起來，抵抗病菌强大，絕不能患這種的。</p>
<p>「傷寒」普通約長四週，初週食慾不强，倦怠發燒。次週則熱度加高，約在攝氏三十九度及四十度，意識不淸，譫語，舌苔乾燥，暗黑而厚，而舌尖剝離反是，此週最危險，三週時尙不知注意，如腸內遺瘍，甚至出血，穿孔，而溫度則降低，不免虛脫而死；但度過三週，無此現象，則四週後體溫復常，諸症象消失？卽均漸次痊愈矣。</p>
<p>「赤痢」普通分赤白兩種，但赤莉較重，而通俗亦稱為痢疾，輕者類似大腸炎，腹部甚痛，排洩時裹急後重，便中帶黏液質，但重者則腸部生潰瘍，便內有濃血，倦怠無力，無神，排洩次數增多，往往死亡。</p>
<p>總觀以上三種疾病，由於一時的不慎，而遭受到很大的痛苦，甚至死亡，敢不戒哉？故古人有言；「病從口入，禍從口出。」誠不謬也，但飮食的謹愼，不能那麼準有把握，現在，有救星了，比打預防針還可靠方便的，就是那最著名的「若素」，它是最可靠，最安全的預防良藥，如果你不願受到疾病的痛苦。就趕快服用道偉大的若素「若素」成分為維他命B强力消化酵素賀爾蒙…等故有特効。（各地各藥房均售）</p>

<p>紐約九日哈瓦斯社電　紐約泰晤士報今日載稱、開闢第二戰塲之議、雖甚囂塵上、迄未見諸事實推原其故，　因英美當局對於其方法與目的意見尙未一致、按之原來計劃、英國方面負責以全力製造驅逐機、美國則專事製造轟炸機、迨至現在、英國似已改變方針、擬以全力製造轟炸機、蓋據英國軍事當局之意、英國所欲者為遠程飛行轟炸機、美國轟炸機則不適合此種條件、此其一、美國轟炸機飛行較為敏疾、威脅力亦較强大、但其所裝炸彈祇友英機之半、此其二美國方面　張高空擲彈轟炸、英國方面理論適得其反、此其三、在此三種異見未獲解決辦法之前、似不致有進一步之舉動云、</p>

<h3>野村來返國談　日美交涉感想　有辱使命未能挽回危局石射等談美洲各國近況</h3>

<h3>尼羅河散記（下）</h3>
<p>達拉（Daraw）在白列去島之北，是買賣駱駝的市塲。駱駝生長的地方，一定是獸類極多的土地。埃及在史前期　雨蓮綿，樹木繁茂，長　豐草之間，　多牯牛，獅子，野狗，熊和象等。至於尼羅河中，只見河馬在打滾，　魚追逐魚蟹之屬。現在還可以在附近的廟中見到　魚的乾屍，即所謂木乃伊者。近來偶然在盧克索捕獲一條　魚，殺死了製造木乃伊，巳成為新奇的新聞。因自宗敎當局表示不再保護這種醜陋的水族後，　魚差不多已經絕跡。</p>
<p>由此北行，達一小鎭名烏達夫（Idfu），以雄偉壯觀的炎勒斯廟著名，壁上雕刻極富，都是埃及帝王肖像，可惜早年來此的基督敎徒、因過份熱心宣傳自己的敎徒，竟把墻上的雕刻完全搗毀。</p>
<p>尼羅河上這時有賞心悅目的景色。算你在晨曦初上時泛舟於河上吧，遠處林間的白靈島，傳出宛囀的歌聲。兩岸的麥田中的棕櫊樹上，有不少小鳥飛嗚，成為自然界最好的音樂。往來於河上的貨船緩緩來去，舟子一邊撑篙，一邊唱着山歌，很怡然自得的樣子。岸上蹄聲得得，有一匹驢子飛馳過去，忽然發出一陣難聽的驢鳴，像是一柄鋸子在鋸堅靭的木頭的怪聲。太陽升起時，尼羅河上最大的風琴開始奏樂。世界上從未聽到過這等音樂，遠聽像一隊合奏的音樂隊，其實這是用軸轤從尼羅河車水到田裹的聲音。農夫每戽一桶水灌入田中，軸轤就旋轉一次，發出咕魯的聲音，雖然這是一種戰擦的聲浪，但聽來很是悅耳，含有音樂性的美麗。這種每天可以聽到的音樂，歷時很久，巳是古代傳到現在了。</p>
<p>這樣的行行重行行，由尼羅河泛舟北上，就　達上文提到過的盧克索。從阿斯旺啟行，沿途所見只是農村田畝，竹　泥屋，到　克索才可見到高大壯麗的王宮廟宇，現代化的旅館，　皇富麗。附近有大城底比斯（Tudhes），可稱世界最大墓地。歷代帝王，王后，貴族，埋骨於此的，罄竹難警，墻上畫有古代人耕種的方法，燒肉，硝皮，洪麵包，造房屋，造船，都和今人一般。有埃及最大的石像拉美斯二世（RamesesII），石像總重一千噸。耳朶有三呎半長，脚闊四呎牛，可見這石像高大的一般。</p>
<p>尼羅河除夏季潮汛來時作棕褐色外，其餘時節都是可愛的綠色。天空是深藍色，為埃及最可貴的色彩。河上白帆片片，空中閃耀着烏羽的光彩。飛翔在尼羅河上的鳥類大別之有戴勝（Hoopoe南非洲特產的有美麗鳥冠的鳥類），釣魚郎，百靈，綠色的食蜂鳥，鳶，白鷺，鵜鵬等等。在明藍的天空中，碧綠的沃土上，金黃的沙漢裹，這許多熱帶的鳥類廻旋飛翔，獨往獨來，不知道烽火已逼近到尼羅河畔，連牠們的巢穴都有被摧毀的危險</p>
<p>還有尼羅河畔的山峯。也許你以為埃及除掉沙漠地帶外，都是平原，其實不然，河的兩岸都有山脈，峻峭的同壁，有是矗起在河的右岸，有時則在左岸隨着晨昏的推移，呈現出不同的色彩。正午是奶白色，下午是黃金色，後來變成緋紅，日落時成為朱紅，薄暮時變為淡紫，在無數燦爛的星光之下，成為紫黑色。</p>
<p>在寂寞的唐達拉（Dandara）小鎭上，有號稱埃及維納絲的海莎廟（TempleofHathor）。道座廟宇相傳至今有二千年，尙算近代的古物。墻壁上畫的是羅馬帝王犠牲於埃及神道之前的故事。由此北行的各村落中，都有廟宇壁畫，有的施以彩色，鮮艷如昨，但稽考時代，總在三千年以前，近代的彩色畫能否歷如許歲月，仍完整無恙，倒是一個疑問。</p>
<p>由此駛赴開羅道中，尼羅河的景色仍是優美絕倫·一岸崇山起伏，一岸是田地與農村，不過所見的村莊與城市較前廣大，逐漸有新式工廠出現。和這種現代化的設備相對的是梅登金字塔，這是比蓋薩大金字塔還要古舊的建築。此地常要吹括五旬風」，所謂　旬風，就是在三月中旬起埃及有五十天要吹刮的東南熱風，風起時飛砂走石，人困獸奔，為害極大。前數日北非電訊所傳的大風砂，使雙方難於作戰，就是這種五旬風肆虐。在自然的制裁之下，就是猛烈無情的砲火，也不得不暫時默爾而息，亦足見人類與宇宙相比，就渺小不足道了。</p>
<p>在　塊並不十分廣大的國土中，能够有五千年豐富的生活和文化，那全仗　條偉大的河流，蘊藏出一個偉大的種族來。尼羅河使乾燥的泥土變濕，用它一雙濕手造出聽明的埃及人。尼羅河永遠是湯湯地流着，五千年來的文化，仍將在今後數千年中翩翩如生。　（完）</p>

<h3>怎樣利用空閒時間</h3>
<p>— 海麟</p>
<p>（八仙橋靑年會少年部所舉辦之屋頂納凉會，於每星期六晚上八時在十樓星頂上舉行，八月一日是為第一次，會內特請陳榮生先生演講，題目是怎樣利用空閒時間一。是晚因屋頂狹小，聽得者蒼少，實在這個題材是每個靑年所應該研究的，何况目前正是一個長長的暑假，如果不知道怎樣利用它，未免可惜，故將它介紹給許多靑年朋友們作為參考。但因講地位於屋頂，黑暗中未能當塲記下，只憑記憶所及，略記如下：）</p>
<p>世界上的人，可以分為二大類：一類是忙人，一天到晚為事業，為社會而忙。這種人就是醫生，律師，敎員，工人，農夫……和任何公司中的職員等，他們是造福於社會，服務於人類，是世界上不可缺少的人。而另外一種是閒人，他們一天到晚空閒着，他們只是社會的寄生蟲，只能消費，而沒有生產能力，流氓，乞丐之流皆是，這種人當然不需要它們，日久下去是不免要被淘汰的。</p>
<p>而這二類人的承繼者，就是我們靑年人，每個人是要在這二條路上選一條走的，當然我們希望將來做一個忙人，而不願做一個閒人。是的，一個人太閒了是會消麼人的生氣與力量的，尤其是在現在正在緞練的時期中，更不能放鬆一步，不能讓空閒佔領我們，靑年人只有嫌時間太少，不够應用，絕不會嫌時間太多，而讓它空閒着。</p>
<p>可是究竟怎樣來利用空閒呢？我以為可以從靑年會少年會員的座右銘一德，智，體，羣」四字入手，全備這四項的靑年，也就是理想中的人物，社會，國家，人類全需要他來改進。</p>
<p>德　德便是道德，品性，德行，一個人有了好的道德比之得任何實貝都要値錢，沒有了他，則無論你有多深的學問，多强的身體，也是等於一個廢人，世界不需沒有道德的人存在。譬如你要用一位帳房，這兒有二個人由你挑選，一個是有高深學問的會計人才，元論中西薄記都會做，可是他喜歡「揩油」：另外一個人只會中式薄記，但他有高尙的品性，人格，絕不取不義之財，那麽試問你用那一位呢？毫無異議是後者吧。由這例就告訴了我們有了天一般高的學問，而無道德還是個無用之人，普天且往往一個德性惡劣的人，有了學問更加强了他作惡的能力，譬如　父案的兄弟二人，如果沒有高深學問，他許想不出應用了電力來致人於死亡的方法，更想不出應用了硝鐵水來消滅遺體以圖脫罪的計劃，這例子便是告訴我們有了好的學問反是害了他，更可以明白德行是大於一切的，現在旣是有空閒時間，我們應利用來修養道德處處地方留意自己的行為，多看些自我修養與名人傳記一類書籍，去仿効他們，以期將自已修養成高尙品性的人。</p>
<p>智　在讀書時也許要發牢騷，天天三四十個算術題目，做死人了，連得要看些課外有益的書都沒有空！那麼朋友們，現在是暑假了，沒有那麼多功課要你做，有着空閒的腦子與不　上的眼睛，眞可以大大地利用它，許了你在忙時的願，有用的書多得很，可以學學的實用技能也不少，要知道現代的社會中要找一條出路是不客易的，全要考騐你眞眞的才能，無論是小學生也可担任的練習生職位，也耍你大學生的程度去考取之，「優者勝，劣者欺一，道條定例以後是更顯著了，快些利用空閒時間多進一點學問，學無止境，盡量的求取吧！</p>
<p>體　要知道，有了健全的體格才能成就偉大事業，否則有了好學問，好德行，而身體虛弱不堪，試問你有什麼力量可以把你的本事貢獻給社會呢？還不是要「望德　而興嘆」嗎？現在暑天裹正是練身體的好時候，練身體不一定需要健身房，而在乎日不間斷，那麼替家庭操作是最好的方法，目下每家人家都因米糧而减少傭人，如果你能為你家長代勞一部分工作，那家長多麽高興啊！而一方面又可鍛煉身體而又不會間斷，將來對於你身體健康上一定是有很大的幫助的。另一方面能生活在其樂融融的家庭中，對於身心上，精神上之得着快樂，也是健身之一法呵</p>
<p>羣　羣就是多交益友，所謂一句老話，「在家靠父母，出外靠朋友」，但靠父母充其量才不過二十年左右，而一生中减去二十年之其他年代完全是要靠朋友，一個人能在一生中交着一個知已，其得　是匪淺的：痛苦時他會來安慰你，在事業失敗時，他會來鼓勵你，幫助你。這種金錢買不到的友情，是一生享用不盡的，但是需要的是益友，並非酒肉朋友，擇友也是人生所應注意之一事，否則因交了壤友而同流合汚的不知凡幾，故得一知已是須要長時期的觀察，諺語說：「路遙知馬力，過後見人心」！也就是這倘意思現在大家應該在道空閒時，不妨利用之廣交益友，則將來的互助是不可言喻的。</p>
<p>最後，我勸大家要囤積居奇，但是不要弄錯，不是希望大家囤日用貨品，而是希望靑年們乘空閒的時間內多囤一點德·智，體·羣·囤這些，非但不會給人駡奸商，而且是人人勸人勸巳所做的囤積居奇的好生意，將來一定會發財的，盡量的囤吧！</p>
<h3>吃飯與做人</h3>
<p>— 毅民</p>
<p>人生兩大要事：一是吃飯；一是做人，不吃飯想要做人，是做不成功的；只吃飯而不好好做人，則稱之為「飯桶」。</p>
<p>以前在北平時，曾見某飯館懸一聯，寫的是：「放大肚皮吃飯，立定脚跟作人。」也許道「放大肚皮四字是給飯館拉生意，但仔細想來，這兩句却也是至理。</p>
<p>可是現在，吃飯倒沒有從前那麼容易了！費了九牛二虎之力還弄不到一個飽，試問如何放大社皮」？</p>
<p>不過，我們能活一天，就要安分守已的做一天人，那才對得起我們實貴的生命。因此我們不防把上面的一付對聯改成：「東紧裤带吃飯，立定脚跟作人。」以为吾人在此非常时期的座右銘。</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— 止正</p>
<p>什麼是路？這是從沒路的地方踐踏出來的，從只有荊棘的地方開　出來的！</p>
<p>一要生存，二要溫飽，三要發展。所謂生存，不是苟活：所謂溫飽，不是奢侈；，所謂發展，不是放縱。</p>
<p>倘要生存，當然要學習！</p>
<p>祇有在肉體勞動中，才能得到健康，才能促進人類的相互團結。</p>
<p>跡躇更壞於粗莽；學習射擊的人，有時也許可以射中鵠的，但那不動手的，便永遠不會射中。</p>

<p>葉二太太和翠珍週了各間維城日常起坐的屋子，證實維城和阿興是在晚上冒了雪出去的·直到維城寢室的玻璃墊子底下，找到了一張維城自白的紙，才算把跳躍的心放下了一半　那紙上，潦潦草草寫着這幾行字：「我有往訪國器國芳兄妹之必要。然又慮叔母不能允許，故乘雪夜，帶阿興出行。此行係赴雙喬。我何以必須在雪夜出行，又何以必在雙橋，他日，叔母自能知之。至明日早晨，翠　或其他婢媼侯人發覺，應先以此紙呈二太太察閱，庶幾可以使其安心。我往雙橋，有健僕隨從，自不虞有傾跌或他項危險發生。明日傍晚不歸，後日上午必可歸來。維城留字。一二，二八，夜。」</p>
<p>葉二太太　嘴道：「這孩子怎麼不和人商量，就帶了阿興走的呢？阿與最不好，他不是三歲孩子，知道天在下雪，天又這麼冷，少爺要他走，他就跟了走嗎？等他回來，我非痛痛快快的駡他一頓不可。一翠珍道：「二伯母也不要生氣，我起先也是一嚇，現在知道他是往雙橋去的，又有阿與做伴，這倒是放心了·」葉二太太道：「雪天的路，怎麼能走？小說子上說的，從前方卿，不是也跌在雪裹的嗎？還有南天門那齣戲。」葉二太太還在引古證今，翠珍却已在維城屋子裏，知道維城是穿了那雙厚底的棉鞋，還帶了雨傘，還帶了電筒，還帶了一根手杖。後來又查得帶了風鏡，穿了西裝雨衣；西裝雨衣，雖然不能和棉袍一樣長度，披在身上，究竟一可以避寒，再可禦雨。翠珍在一樣一樣背給葉二太太聽，葉二太太又覺得放心了些。　（五一）</p>

<h3>Aleutian Islands Vicinity - US Ships Repelled - Details of the Solomon Sea Battle</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th, DOMEI - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 10th that enemy forces of significant strength appeared in the direction of the Aleutian Islands on August 8th and were repelled by the Imperial Navy. Tokyo, 9th, DOMEI - Regarding the great sea battle near the Solomon Islands, details are now announced as follows: At 11:20 AM on August 7th, a Japanese reconnaissance plane caught sight of an enemy fleet sailing north of the Coral Sea and immediately reported it to the authorities. Soon after, Japanese bombers repeatedly flew to attack the enemy ships, dropping countless heavy bombs. The enemy fleet was dispersed, and several ships, enveloped in black smoke and flames, sank to the bottom of the Coral Sea. The remaining enemy ships scattered and fled eastward. Enemy fighters and bomber-fighters took off from aircraft carriers to intercept the Japanese planes, resulting in a fierce aerial battle. However, the enemy planes were no match for the Japanese planes and were shot down into the sea one by one. In an instant, 32 fighters and 9 bomber-fighters fell into the sea. As night fell, the Japanese fleet suddenly opened fire and attacked. The enemy ships were caught off guard, and the thunderous sound of cannons was incessant. The two fleets then approached and engaged in battle. Japanese torpedo boats also unleashed their power, sinking enemy ships one by one. This was the first night battle of the Solomon Islands. By dawn on the 8th, the coconut palms on the Solomon Islands gradually became visible in the dawn light. At that time, the Japanese naval and air forces were still pursuing the enemy ships relentlessly, determined to ensure that none escaped. Lisbon, 10th, HAI TONG - According to a Washington communiqué, the naval battle in the Solomon Islands is still ongoing, and the losses on both sides are still difficult to estimate. Tokyo, 10th, DOMEI - According to naval experts, the counter-offensive launched by the British and Americans in the Solomon Islands and Kiska Island is merely a guerrilla tactic to appease public sentiment at home. Their fleet attacked the weakest point in the Japanese defenses on the Solomon Islands, but the swift Japanese navy discovered it, causing the British and Americans to lose 17 warships and more than 11 transport ships. Their attack on Kiska Island was purely for propaganda purposes, and their propaganda has been completely refuted by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters.</p>
<h3>Colonel Hirade Broadcasts Battle Situation, Germany Congratulates Japanese Navy Victory</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th, DOMEI - Naval Spokesman Colonel Hideo Hirade of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters is scheduled to broadcast the detailed battle situation of the Solomon Sea Battle tonight in Tokyo. All Japanese radio stations will rebroadcast it. Tokyo, 10th, HAI TONG - Political figures here commented last night on the naval battle near the Solomon Islands, saying that the British and American fleets clearly wanted to break through the Japanese encirclement of northern Australia, but the superior Japanese navy ultimately defeated them and inflicted a fatal blow. The Allied fleet off the coast of Australia is almost completely wiped out. The air force's contribution to this victory of the Japanese navy is also undeniable. Berlin, 9th, DOMEI - German radio stations broadcast at noon on the 9th a special broadcast of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters' announcement of the great victory of the Japanese navy in the Solomon Sea Battle and played the Japanese military march to express congratulations. Local evening newspapers in Berlin also carried headlines announcing the Japanese navy's great victory in the Solomon Islands. Authoritative sources here declared that this naval battle has confirmed to the world that control of the Western Pacific is firmly in our hands. After suffering this loss, the strength of the British and American navies has further declined, so the Japanese army can freely carry out landing operations in various places. The future development of the war situation will be even more interesting.</p>
<h3>Stilwell and Kerr Arrive in New Delhi</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 10th, DOMEI - General Stilwell, Chief of Staff of the Allied Forces in the Chongqing region, and Dr. Kerr, Special Envoy of President Roosevelt, arrived in New Delhi yesterday morning, one after the other.

<h3>Spanish Invention - Small Motorized Bicycle - Lightweight Body and Fuel Efficient</h3>
<p>Madrid, 9th, HAVAS - The famous Spanish sportsman Soriano has recently invented a new type of small motorized bicycle. The model structure is extremely simple. The car is equipped with a small biplane engine. Although the body weighs only one hundred pounds, it has the resistance and supply power of an ordinary machine. One gallon of gasoline can travel 180 miles. Currently, there are four such vehicles in use at the Soriano estate in the Basque Province. Twenty years ago, Soriano invented a small gasoline boat. At the speedboat race held at Lake Grenter in northern Italy at that time, the champion, Kilvis, was riding this type of speedboat.</p>

The police tried to use tear gas to disperse the crowd, but the crowd still swarmed and refused to disperse. The police then dispersed the crowd with whips. Gandhi was originally scheduled to give a speech at Chawpatty Park here on the evening of the 9th, so people flocked to the park from the afternoon. After hearing the news of Gandhi's arrest, the crowd was indignant and clashed with the police. Most of the shops in the city have closed their doors and gone on strike. Everywhere, crowds were preventing vehicles from driving and shouting slogans such as "British people should withdraw from India," "Boycott British goods," and "Boycott American goods." The police were running back and forth in the city to suppress the unrest, exhausted. Also, in Nagpur, Pune, Ahmedabad, and Kaira, Congress Party figures were arrested and branches were sealed. The people in each area were extremely indignant and clashed with the police, and the situation was quite serious. Lisbon, 9th, DOMEI - According to a Reuters dispatch from Bombay, clashes occurred between the people and the police in five locations in Bombay. In addition to using tear gas, the police also opened fire, injuring 15 people who were sent to hospitals. According to the British authorities, the people looted two granaries of the Governor's Office, threw stones at the police station, and set fire to public buses. Many British police officers were attacked by the people in various places. On the 9th, the authorities ordered a nighttime curfew in the disturbed areas and banned gatherings of more than five people. Carrying weapons will also be formally prohibited.

<p>Circumstances of the Leaders' Arrests</p>
<p>Lisbon, 10th, DOMEI - According to a Bombay dispatch, Mrs. Gandhi has also been arrested and sent to Pune, where Gandhi is confined. Before Mrs. Gandhi was arrested, the police asked her if she had decided to give a speech to the public at Bombay's Shivaji Park. Mrs. Gandhi replied in the affirmative and was arrested. Lisbon, 9th, DOMEI - According to Bombay sources, the circumstances of the arrest of Gandhi and other leaders of the National Congress Party are as follows: At 5:00 AM on the 9th, a British police team drove three cars to Gandhi's residence and surrounded it. They ordered the guards to lead them inside. At that time, Gandhi was already praying. He ordered his secretary, Miraben, Ms. Wright, and other leaders of the National Congress Party to come out and inquire first. After the prayer was over, he calmly surrendered and boarded the car with the police team. On that day, the police authorities completely cut off all telephones and railways from 2:00 AM, conducting the operation secretly so that all parties could not understand the truth of the matter. After Gandhi was arrested, his second secretary, Pyarelal, published the words that Gandhi had instructed him to convey at the time of his arrest. He said, "Gandhi originally intended to meet with the workers today, but this is now impossible. However, he entrusted me to convey to them that our future is only freedom or death. This is a word that we cannot forget." Also, when Mrs. Gandhi was summoned, the police authorities asked her if she would represent Gandhi in giving a speech. Mrs. Gandhi said, "I have this intention." Because of this, she was also arrested and imprisoned. As for the arrest of Speaker Acharya, it was at 4:30 AM. The police team only surrendered after arriving at his bedroom. As of 3:00 AM on the 9th, the entire Executive Committee of the National Congress Party had been arrested. In addition, 149 others, including former Bombay Governor Khare and Ms. Sophie White, head of the Women's Volunteer Corps, were also detained. Also, news, Gandhi, Ms. Naidu, Secretary Desai, and Ms. Slade, who were arrested, are currently being escorted from Pune to the Aga Khan Palace. British special police teams have implemented strict security around the palace. Also, 40 former Bombay Governor Khare and others, (including four women) leaders of the National Congress Party, have also been escorted from Bombay to Itanvadi and imprisoned in the central prison there. Lisbon, 10th, DOMEI - According to Bombay news, riots broke out in Bombay after Gandhi and others were arrested. The police released tear gas and other things to disperse the crowd. As a result, ten people were shot and killed. Most of the factories in Bombay have stopped work. Trams and public buses have also been suspended. The curfew starts at 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>Defense Committee Holds Meeting</p>
<p>Lisbon, 9th, DOMEI - According to New Delhi sources, the Indian Governor-General's Office held a meeting of the Defense Committee this morning. In addition to Governor-General Linlithgow and one British member, all eleven Indian members did not attend, which is enough to show the reaction of the Indian people to the British high-pressure policy.</p>
<p>Muslim League's Attitude Undecided</p>
<p>Lisbon, 9th, DOMEI - According to Bombay sources, Jinnah, Chairman of the All India Muslim League, has notified Muslims to join the National Congress's actions and await the decision of the Muslim League Standing Committee meeting to be held on the 16th of this month to determine their attitude before deciding whether to advance or retreat.</p>
<p>Letter from the Governor of Hong Kong to the Indians</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 9th, DOMEI - Lieutenant General Isogai, Governor of Hong Kong, recently issued a letter to the All India Committee of the Bombay National Congress, stating that if you cannot rescue the Indian people from British rule, it will be a disgrace not only to yourselves but also to all the people of India. Now is a good opportunity to solve the problem, and it will soon pass. All Indians in Asia today share a common goal and will complete the independence movement under a common leader, which is commendable.</p>
<h3>Situation in the European War - Major Developments Imminent - Allied Forces May Land in the Netherlands - The Battle of the Atlantic Can Control the Overall Situation</h3>
<p>Zurich, 10th, HAVAS - According to the military reporter of the Swiss Daily, the current situation is unlikely to last, and there will be major developments in Europe. The German army is advancing fiercely towards the Caucasus, and the Soviet Union cannot give up its lifeline. To reverse the situation, the Allied countries must take major action. If the Red Army does not fight a desperate battle south of Moscow, the British and American armies must launch a large-scale landing on the European continent. Merely bombing German industries with British planes is not enough to alleviate the German offensive on the Eastern Front. Stockholm, 10th, HAVAS - According to reports, after receiving repeated reports from reconnaissance planes, the German authorities have now admitted that the danger of enemy troops landing in the Netherlands is becoming increasingly serious. Several people in the Netherlands have been arrested as hostages to see how the Dutch people will react in the event of a British or American landing. Lisbon, 10th, HAVAS - The Manha newspaper commented on the Moscow conference today, saying that the proposal to launch a second front was based on strategy rather than military strategy. Any government that is dominated by strategy and ignores military strategy often cannot regret it. However, the opening of a second front is urgently needed by the Allied countries. It is necessary both in domestic politics and foreign policy. Many people in Britain agree with this move, not to mention the Soviet Union. However, sending 500,000 troops to land on the coast of Western Europe is unlikely to significantly change the war situation or alleviate the German offensive in the East. The real battle is the Battle of the Atlantic. The victory or defeat in that area can control the overall situation. However, like in 1918, the war may not be solved by military means alone.</p>
<p>Police Science Common Sense</p>
<h3>Summer Disease Prevention - Epidemics Often Occur Due to Careless Eating and Drinking - Strengthening the Stomach and Intestines Can Reduce the Chance of Infection</h3>
<p>Those annoying flies, flying all over the world, because of their back and forth flying, they ambush human life everywhere. The most important intestinal diseases include dysentery and typhoid fever. Even a moment of carelessness can lead them to take away your life. Therefore, the reason for contracting these diseases is mostly due to careless eating and drinking, bringing these kinds of dysentery bacteria and typhoid bacteria into the intestines, giving them a chance to breed rampantly in the human body. Their symptoms are briefly written below: "Cholera," commonly known as tiger cholera, is the most terrible epidemic, which can end a person's life in a very short period of time! Mild cases are nothing more than vomiting and diarrhea a few times, with a headache or dizziness, mild fatigue, and cold limbs, which can be cured in about a week, while severe cases are often fatal, with severe vomiting and diarrhea, sunken eye sockets, sunken fingertips, pale face, thirst, low and hoarse voice, convulsions, and other symptoms. However, people with weakened bodies are more likely to develop this disease. If you take "Ruosu" to strengthen your body and replenish blood, you will become stronger and more resistant to bacteria, and you will never suffer from this disease.</p>
<p>"Typhoid" usually lasts about four weeks. In the first week, appetite is poor, and there is fatigue and fever. In the second week, the temperature increases to about 39 degrees and 40 degrees Celsius, with impaired consciousness, delirium, and a dry, dark, and thick tongue coating, while the tip of the tongue peels off. This week is the most dangerous. If you don't pay attention in the third week, such as intestinal ulcers, or even bleeding and perforation, the temperature will drop, and you will inevitably die from exhaustion. However, if you pass the third week without this phenomenon, the body temperature will return to normal after the fourth week, and all symptoms will disappear, and you will gradually recover.</p>
<p>"Dysentery" is commonly divided into red and white types, but red dysentery is more severe, and is popularly known as dysentery. Mild cases are similar to colitis, with severe abdominal pain, a sense of urgency and incomplete evacuation when defecating, and mucus in the stool, while severe cases develop ulcers in the intestines, with thick blood in the stool, fatigue, listlessness, and an increased number of defecations, often leading to death.</p>
<p>In general, the above three diseases are caused by a moment of carelessness, resulting in great suffering, and even death. How can you not be careful? Therefore, the ancients said, "Disease enters through the mouth, and trouble comes from the mouth." This is indeed true. However, it is not possible to be so precise and have such confidence in careful eating and drinking. Now, there is a savior.

<h3>German Advances in the Caucasus - Occupying Two Major Industrial Towns - Advancing Towards the Black Sea Coast in a Fan-Shaped Formation - Battle for Stalingrad Reaches its Peak</h3>
<p>Berlin, 10th, HAI TONG - The German High Command announced last night that the oil field center of Maikop, at the northern end of the Caucasus Mountains, was occupied by German mechanized units at 6:20 PM last night (1:20 AM Shanghai Daylight Saving Time).</p>
<p>German Führer's Headquarters, 10th, HAI TONG - The German High Command issued a special war report yesterday afternoon stating that German infantry divisions have already captured Krasnodar, the capital of the Kuban region. Before the Germans occupied this important Soviet military equipment center, there was a fierce battle north of Kuban. The German Air Force covered the ground forces and broke through the enemy's solid positions north of Kuban, which was very effective.</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th, HAI TONG - Pyatigorsk, the city occupied by the German mechanized units, is one of the leading cities in the Caucasus and an important city in the tea-producing area. It has a population of approximately 65,000.</p>
<p>Ukrainian Border, 10th, HAVAS - News that German advance troops have arrived at Igatolino in the Caucasus. Today they may also occupy Georgievsk.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 10th, HAVAS - After the German army occupied Krasnodar and Maikop in southern Soviet Union, they are now only about sixty miles away from the three ports of Anapa, Novorossiysk, and Tuapse on the Black Sea. However, the German army may rest for a while, while suppressing the remnants of the enemy on the coast of Azov, and transferring fresh troops and military supplies to the foothills of the Caucasus Mountains to climb and attack. However, the battle for Stalingrad is reaching its peak. Soviet troops not only resisted fiercely, but also launched counterattacks from time to time.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 9th, DOMEI - According to news arriving here, the German army is attacking Stalingrad fiercely, and a part of it has crossed the Don River east of Tsimlyansk and advanced to the Volga River. Its vanguard tank units have also attacked Kodernikovo, 170 kilometers southwest of Stalingrad, and are continuing to attack Kodernikovo.</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th, HAI TONG - The German High Command issued a special supplementary war report last night stating that the German troops that captured Krasnodar were the infantry divisions that captured Rostov and Bataysk thirteen days ago. These divisions pursued the remnants of the enemy and completed the 280-kilometer journey between the Don and Kuban Rivers in thirteen days, marching along a sloping public road without cover in gray sand and scorching heat, directly to the northern defense line of Krasnodar and the Kuban River, which was protected by huge tank traps. After a fierce battle, they broke through the enemy's defense line and began attacking the city. The German Air Force's light anti-aircraft artillery units made great contributions in these battles.</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th, HAI TONG - The last two major strongholds in the Kuban region, Krasnodar and Maikop, were occupied by the German army yesterday. Although the Soviet Allied forces relied on strong defensive works on the northern bank of the Kuban River to resist the German army, they still failed to prevent the fall of the above two major strongholds. After the German vehicles and friendly forces crossed the Kuban River, they continued to advance towards the port of Novorossiysk on the Black Sea from the foothills of the Caucasus. Before Krasnodar was surrounded by the German army on three sides and had not yet fallen, the Slovak army had already crossed the Kuban River. The annual oil production of the Maikop oil field is approximately between two million and three million tons. The Soviet war situation north of the Caucasus is now in a desperate situation. The German army and friendly forces are now advancing in a fan-shaped formation along three routes: 1. Advancing from Krasnodar towards Novorossiysk. 2. Advancing from Maikop towards the port of Tuapse on the Black Sea. 3. Advancing from Loshilorovsk towards the upper reaches of the Kuma River. According to non-German sources, the German troops advancing along the Rostov-Baku railway have now reached Pyatigorsk. The rapid advance of the German army has put the Soviet troops along the Sea of Azov in a desperate situation. The war in the northern Caucasus has now been decided, and complete occupation is only a matter of time. The war between the Don and Volga Rivers is now in full swing. It seems that Timoshenko has flown to Stalingrad to personally supervise the battle, but the Soviet army's counterattack west of Stalingrad has not succeeded, and the German army has approached the Volga River in that area.</p>
<h3>Soviet Army Employs Restraining Tactics, Launches Powerful Counteroffensive in the Central Sector</h3>
<p>Moscow, 9th (Havas) – According to official announcements, our forces are still fighting in the Kotelnikovo area, while in the Voronezh area, our forces have achieved successive victories and have already crossed the Don River.</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Havas) – The High Command announced in its war bulletin today that the cities of Maikop and Krasnodar have been occupied by our forces. Simultaneously, major battles are also taking place in the central sector of the Belyov area. The reason is that the Red Army is attempting to employ restraining tactics in order to save the southern Red Army from the severe threat it is facing. The Red Army launched an offensive after receiving reinforcements, but it was ultimately defeated by our forces and retreated to its original positions.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 9th (Havas) – The Red Army's official newspaper, Red Star, admitted today to the German victories in the Caucasus, stating that the Red Army in the Armavir area could not withstand the enemy's fierce attacks and has been forced to retreat. In the Kropotkin area, the enemy has a large number of armored units, and our forces have been unable to resist and have retreated. In short, the Soviet forces fighting on the front lines are powerless to stop the enemy from advancing.</p>
<h3>Soviet Soldiers Contest Every Inch of Ground, Cossack Troops Display Power</h3>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Haitong News Agency) – Although Soviet leaders are urging Soviet troops to fight to the death, the German and allied forces in the southern sector of Eastern Europe have achieved another major victory, occupying Pyatigorsk at the northern foot of the Caucasus. This city is 120 kilometers southeast of Voroshilovsk. At the same time, German forces between the Volga and Don Rivers have been engaged in fierce battles with counterattacking Soviet forces southwest of Stalingrad, and the enemy is retreating in defeat. Yesterday, German forces within the great bend of the Don River launched an attack west of the Kala area, trapping elite Soviet troops in a heavy encirclement. Moscow Radio reported that the enemy forces are continuing to advance, and the situation on the front lines is becoming increasingly tense. Our forces have a responsibility to defend the territory, and must do everything possible to defend every inch of ground.</p>
<p>Moscow, 10th (Havas) – Today's Pravda reports that the enemy forces on the southern front have again broken through our defenses, and the situation is becoming increasingly urgent. Our front-line soldiers should fight even harder and should meet the enemy forces head-on, rendering them helpless. At present, the Red Army is conducting defensive battles in the Kropotkin and Armavir areas, which are exceptionally fierce. Near a certain city, our Cossack cavalry, with the assistance of the air force, annihilated over a thousand Romanian cavalrymen in a single day, but the German side quickly sent reinforcements to the area and broke through the Red Army's positions to the south.</p>
<h3>Moscow Conference Concludes Yesterday, British and American Representatives Remain in the Soviet Union to Discuss Pending Issues, Soviet Union Expresses Gratification with Turkey's Attitude</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Alliance News Agency) – According to a broadcast from London relaying Vichy radio, the conference in Moscow concluded four days after the arrival of British Ambassador Sir Cripps and American Ambassador Steinhardt. It is said that some British and American representatives will remain in the Kremlin to resolve pending issues. This conference was to discuss the opening of a second front in order to relieve the pressure on the Red Army from the German forces in the Caucasus.</p>
<p>Vichy, 9th (Havas) – The political consequences and impact of the German invasion of the Caucasus and the imprisonment of prominent figures of the Indian National Congress are attracting the attention of international observers here. Regarding the Caucasus matter specifically, it has triggered unprecedented rumors. Whether British Prime Minister Churchill is in Moscow is uncertain, but it is believable that the British and American ambassadors to the Soviet Union have jointly arrived in Moscow and are holding meetings with Soviet authorities. This matter is of great significance, and it is presumed that the agenda will be either the opening of a second front or the shipment of supplementary military supplies to the Soviet Union, to demonstrate the determination of the Allied nations to provide assistance. However, if Stalin and his associates believe that the long-awaited Allied aid is insufficient to meet their needs, what will happen then? Rumors that the Soviet Union is preparing to make a separate peace with Germany have surfaced more than once, indicating that Soviet authorities are attempting to use these rumors to stimulate the Allied nations to provide more effective assistance. Geographically speaking, Turkey's neutrality is closely related to the successive defeats of the Red Army. At present, there is no reason to doubt Turkey's sincerity in maintaining neutrality. Turkish Prime Minister Saraçoğlu reiterated this intention in a speech to the National Assembly the other day. Turkey controls the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits, holding the key to the Black Sea. The war is currently taking place around this area, and the Caucasus war situation, which is increasingly unfavorable to the Red Army, is directly related to Turkey's position. However, the Turkish government has just dispatched Agâh Cafar as the new ambassador to the Soviet Union in order to communicate information and thereby increase mutual friendship. It is unexpected that the Soviet Union would have such a friendly nation in its time of trouble. Regarding the Indian issue, Britain's attitude has suddenly become strong, and it has decided to arrest the leaders of the Congress Party. This move may have a significant impact on the situation in Asia and will further intensify the internal disputes in this largest of British colonies.</p>
<p>Opening a Second Front: British and American Differences</p>
<p>New York, 9th (Havas) – The New York Times published today that although the discussion of opening a second front has been rampant, it has not yet materialized. The reason is that British and American authorities have not yet reached agreement on the method and purpose. According to the original plan, the British side was responsible for manufacturing fighter planes with all its might, while the United States was dedicated to manufacturing bombers. As of now, Britain seems to have changed its policy and intends to manufacture bombers with all its might. According to the British military authorities, what Britain wants are long-range bombers, while American bombers are not suitable for this type of condition. This is the first point. American bombers fly faster and are more threatening, but they carry only half the bombs of British planes. This is the second point. The American side advocates high-altitude bombing, while the British side's theory is the opposite. This is the third point. Until these three differences are resolved, it seems unlikely that any further action will be taken.</p>
<p>German Defenses in Western Europe Are Solid</p>
<p>Madrid, 10th (Haitong News Agency) – Spanish reporter Mr. Campo recently visited Western Europe to inspect the German coastal defenses. He has now published a lengthy report in ABC, stating that under the close cooperation of the German army, navy, and air force, it is impossible for the enemy to launch a surprise attack. Although each fortress is an independent structure, there is extremely convenient communication between them via wireless telegraphy, telephone, railway, and highway. Therefore, from Norway to the Bay of Biscay, it is like a long wall. All kinds of fortifications extend deep into the countryside, and the techniques of camouflage are superb. The reporter was often deceived by them.</p>
<h3>British and German Air Forces Exchange Bombardments</h3>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Havas) – According to news issued from here, yesterday a squadron of German aircraft heavily bombed British factories for quite some time, ending only at midnight. Important military targets in Leeds and Sheffield were bombed, and several fires were seen.</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Haitong News Agency) – According to responsible sources here, four British aircraft were shot down last night while dropping bombs and incendiary devices on western Germany. German aircraft also attacked a city on the southern coast of England and military targets on the east coast last night.</p>
<h3>Former Hungarian Prime Minister Fights on the Eastern Front</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 10th (Havas) – According to a special dispatch from Budapest in the Neue Zürcher Zeitung, former Hungarian Prime Minister Imrédy and former Hungarian Renewal Party Chairman Jaross are fighting in the Soviet front-line army.</p>
<h3>Nomura Returns Home to Discuss His Feelings on the Japan-US Negotiations: Ashamed of His Mission, Unable to Avert the Crisis; Ishii and Others Discuss the Recent Situation in American Countries</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Domei News Agency) – According to a special dispatch from Shonan Port (i.e., Singapore) on the "Asama Maru" on the 9th, when the exchange ship "Asama Maru" was about to arrive at Shonan Port, the Asahi Shimbun reporter traveling with it interviewed Ambassador Nomura, who expressed his feelings, saying that he had been extremely depressed during his past detention. Today, he has been restored to freedom from an unfree situation, for which he is deeply grateful. To this day, the reason why the Japanese navy and its air force have been able to achieve great victories in the various naval battles in the Pacific is, in my opinion, due to years of training. I have heard that the United States has had a large part of its main battleships and aircraft carriers destroyed in the Pacific, so at present, the United States has no possibility of launching an offensive against Japan in the Pacific. When I received the mission to be the ambassador to the United States, I deeply felt the importance of the mission, but I have not achieved any success. When I took office, Ambassador Kumaichi Hōnda encouraged me to return with honor, and I have not forgotten this matter to this day. I once made it clear that maintaining peace in the Pacific and preventing the expansion of the European war between Japan and the United States is truly for the happiness of mankind. However, now my important mission has ended in failure, so I can truly be called a defeated general. Although the term "defeated general" is used in the military, I will inevitably be labeled as a defeated general due to the failure of the Japan-US negotiations. I don't know how many times I had talks with Roosevelt and Hull when I was in the United States. From February 14th of last year, when I went to the White House to present my credentials, until December 7th, when Ambassador Kurusu and I went to the State Department to hand Hull Japan's reply, it lasted eight months. Today, recalling the past course of Japan-US negotiations, I truly have endless feelings. The Ambassador still avoided explaining various issues related to the future of the United States.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Domei News Agency) – According to a special dispatch from Shonan Port on the "Asama Maru" on the 9th, Ambassador Kurusu recently expressed his feelings about the Japan-US negotiations to the Asahi Shimbun reporter traveling with him, saying that he still remembers being summoned to Foreign Minister Togo's official residence in early November of last year. There, he saw Togo with a solemn face, instructing him to go to Washington to assist Ambassador Nomura, and expressing that Japan, at this last moment, was determined to exert all its strength to negotiate with the United States through diplomatic means and could not delay any longer. Before departing on the afternoon of the 4th, he also paid a visit to the Prime Minister. As a result, Secretary Yuuki and he flew to Hong Kong together and went to the United States via Manila. When Hull handed us the Japanese aide-mémoire on November 26th of last year, his face seemed unpleasant, because the US government is unusually complex, and diplomatic matters are not decided by Hull alone. Regarding the formation of the ABC line, the United States cannot decide arbitrarily as the Chongqing government and the Dutch government-in-exile can. When I first arrived in the United States, Ambassador Nomura was invigorating his spirits and constantly negotiating with Roosevelt and Hull to avert the crisis in the Pacific. However, as the situation changed, the flames of war were already imminent. At this point, Ambassador Kurusu's topic turned to the British side. According to what he said about the British attitude at that time, when the Japanese army advanced into southern Vietnam and the United States froze Japanese funds, the British attitude underwent a major change. The British view was that if Japan and the United States went to war, it would benefit Britain. Therefore, they first sent troops to reinforce Hong Kong and Singapore, adopting an encirclement posture to stimulate Japan. In the second half of the Japan-US negotiations, the British attitude changed, as the British believed that hundreds of thousands of troops could at least hold Singapore and stop the Japanese army from advancing.</p>
<p>Shonan City, 9th (Domei News Agency) – Japanese Ambassador to Brazil Ishii, who recently arrived here aboard the "Conte Verde", discussed the recent situation in Brazil as follows. Before the Japanese army attacked Pearl Harbor, Brazil generally adopted a bystander attitude, but after the Rio de Janeiro conference decided to declare war, the people held ill will towards Japan. Initially, quite strict rules were applied to Japanese residents, and recently travel has become extremely difficult and unfree. Regarding news of Japanese victories, although the News Control Bureau directly under the President made malicious propaganda, it was unable to conceal the facts, and the truth was eventually published.</p>
<p>Shonan City, 10th (Domei News Agency) – Ambassadors Sakamoto to Peru, Akiyama to Panama, and Yanagiuchi to Colombia, who arrived here on the 9th on the exchange ship "Conte Verde," issued statements as follows. Ambassador Sakamoto said that Peru is in the same position as other South American countries, only following the orders of the United States. The general public has never held ill will towards Japan. For example, the rumor of a Japanese volunteer army was probably instigated by the United States, but after I clarified it, this rumor immediately disappeared. Ambassador Akiyama said that only women and a portion of men have returned this time. Most of the men are still residing there, waiting for the second exchange ship, which is truly regrettable. Ambassador Yanagiuchi said that the oppression of Japanese residents in Colombia is relatively light, and there are very few Japanese residents living there. There is nothing else to say. I am deeply gratified to be able to see the appearance of my motherland.</p>
<p>Civilian Exchange Ship "Kura Maru" Departs Japan</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>The second exchange ship "Kamakura Maru" for British and Japanese diplomats and civilians departed Yokohama port at 11:20 a.m. on the 10th. The ship's hull has been repainted dark gray and marked with a white cross on the side. The ship will first go to Shanghai to pick up about 900 British diplomats and civilians residing in China, and then sail to Lourenço Marques.</p>
<h3>Air Battle Occurs on the Egyptian Front</h3>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Haitong News Agency) – The German High Command announced last night that German light fighters went to the area north of El Alamein early in the morning to bomb enemy artillery positions and convoys, and attacked British troops en route to Alexandria. In the air battle, two enemy aircraft were shot down.</p>
<h3>Truth Comes to Light in the Case of the Abduction of White Russian Officers: Soviet Secret Police Leader Arrested in Paris</h3>
<p>Paris, 10th (Haitong News Agency) – According to reports here, the truth about the disappearance of Tsarist Russian Generals Koutepoff and Miller in Paris twelve and five years ago has come to light due to the arrest of Tretiakov, the former leader of the Soviet secret police in Paris. During World War I, Tsarist Russian General Koutepoff was abducted in broad daylight in Paris on January 27, 1930, and then disappeared without a trace. His successor, General Miller, suffered the same fate in Paris on September 24, 1937. Because General Miller had met with General Skoblin before his disappearance, the French police suspected Skoblin of being involved in the case, so he was sentenced to lifelong exile. His wife was sentenced to twenty years in prison for being suspected of conspiracy. According to Le Petit Parisien, the mastermind of the case, Tretiakov, has been arrested by the German military police. When the German army occupied Minsk, they discovered documents related to Tretiakov's crimes and arrested him. When Tretiakov was active in Paris, he had a residence and a location. The residence and the office of the Tsarist Russian veterans were located in the same building. According to investigations, the office of the Tsarist Russian veterans was equipped with microphones connected to Tretiakov's residence. Tretiakov has also admitted that he was the mastermind behind the abduction of the White Russian generals. When the German army entered Paris, Tretiakov remained in Paris and is still being held in Paris.</p>
<h3>Sketches of the Nile (Continued)</h3>
<p>Daraw is north of Elephantine Island and is a market for buying and selling camels. The places where camels grow must be lands with a large number of beasts. Egypt in prehistoric times had continuous rainfall, lush trees, and among the abundant grasses were many bulls, lions, wild dogs, bears, and elephants. As for the Nile River, only hippos were seen wallowing, and fish chased fish and crabs. Now, dried corpses of catfish can still be seen in nearby temples, the so-called mummies. Recently, a catfish was accidentally caught in Luxor, killed, and made into a mummy, which has become a novel piece of news. Because since the religious authorities expressed that they would no longer protect this ugly aquatic creature, catfish have almost disappeared.</p>
<p>Traveling north from here, you reach a small town called Idfu, famous for its magnificent Temple of Horus, with extremely rich carvings on the walls, all of which are portraits of Egyptian emperors. Unfortunately, early Christians who came here, out of excessive enthusiasm for promoting their religion, completely destroyed the carvings on the walls.</p>
<p>At this time, there are pleasing scenes on the Nile River. Imagine yourself boating on the river at the first light of dawn, the white spirit islands in the distant forests echoing with warbling songs. There are many birds flying and singing on the palm trees in the wheat fields on both banks, becoming the best music in nature. Cargo ships come and go slowly on the river, and the boatmen pole along while singing folk songs, looking very contented. On the shore, there is the sound of hooves, and a donkey rushes past, suddenly emitting a harsh bray, like a saw sawing through tough wood, a strange sound. As the sun rises, the largest organ on the Nile River begins to play music. Never has the world heard such music, which sounds like a band playing together from afar. In fact, it is the sound of water being drawn from the Nile to the fields using a shaduf. Every time the farmer scoops a bucket of water into the field, the shaduf rotates once, making a gurgling sound. Although this is a sound of friction, it sounds very pleasant and has a musical beauty. This music, which can be heard every day, has lasted for a long time and has been passed down from ancient times to the present.</p>
<p>Traveling on and on like this, boating north on the Nile River, you reach Luxor, which was mentioned earlier. Starting from Aswan, all you see along the way are rural fields and bamboo and mud houses. Only in Luxor can you see the tall and magnificent royal palaces and temples, modern hotels, and luxurious emperors. Nearby is the great city of Thebes, which can be called the largest cemetery in the world. The emperors, queens, and nobles of all dynasties buried here are too numerous to count. The walls are painted with ancient methods of farming, roasting meat, tanning hides, baking bread, building houses, and building ships, all of which are the same as they are today. There is the largest stone statue in Egypt, Ramses II. The statue weighs a total of one thousand tons. The ears are three and a half feet long, and the feet are four feet wide, which shows how large the statue is.</p>
<p>Except when the summer floods come and turn it brown, the Nile River is always a lovely green color. The sky is a deep blue, the most precious color in Egypt. White sails dot the river, and the light of crow feathers sparkles in the sky. The birds flying on the Nile River are mainly hoopoes (birds with beautiful crests that are unique to southern Africa), kingfishers, larks, green bee-eaters, kites, egrets, pelicans, and so on. In the bright blue sky, on the green fertile soil, and in the golden sandy lands, these many tropical birds circle and fly, coming and going alone, unaware that the flames of war have approached the banks of the Nile and that even their nests are in danger of being destroyed.</p>
<p>There are also the peaks of the Nile River. Perhaps you thought that Egypt, apart from the desert areas, is all plains, but in fact, it is not. There are mountain ranges on both banks of the river, with steep cliffs that sometimes rise on the right bank of the river and sometimes on the left bank, presenting different colors as morning and evening pass. At noon, it is milky white, in the afternoon it is golden, later it turns scarlet, and at sunset it becomes vermilion. At twilight, it turns lavender, and under countless sparkling stars, it becomes purple-black.</p>
<p>In the lonely town of Dandara, there is the Temple of Hathor, known as the Egyptian Venus. It is said that the temple has been around for two thousand years, making it a relatively modern antiquity. The walls are painted with the story of Roman emperors sacrificing to the Egyptian gods. In the villages north of here, there are temple murals, some of which are colored and as vivid as yesterday, but when the era is examined, it is always before three thousand years ago. Whether modern colored paintings can last for so many years and remain intact is a question.</p>
<p>Driving towards Cairo from here, the scenery of the Nile River is still extremely beautiful. One bank has rolling mountains, and the other has fields and villages. However, the villages and cities seen are larger than before, and new factories are gradually appearing. In contrast to this modern equipment is the Meidum Pyramid, which is an even older building than the Great Pyramid of Giza. This place often has to blow the "Khamsin wind." The so-called "Khamsin wind" is the hot southeast wind that blows in Egypt for fifty days starting in mid-March. When the wind rises, sand and stones fly, and people and animals run in distress, causing great harm. The strong sandstorm transmitted by the North African telegraph a few days ago, which made it difficult for both sides to fight, was the devastation of this Khamsin wind. Under the sanctions of nature, even fierce and merciless artillery fire has to remain silent for a while, which also shows how small and insignificant humans are compared to the universe.</p>
<p>In a piece of land that is not very large, there has been five thousand years of rich life and culture, all thanks to that great river, which nurtured a great race. The Nile River turns dry soil wet, using its pair of wet hands to create the intelligent Egyptians. The Nile River is forever flowing mightily, and the culture of five thousand years will continue to flourish in the thousands of years to come. (The End)</p>
<h3>Infected Housing - Reduced Scope of Lockdown - Limited to Residences of Patient's Family, Complete Lockdown for Public Venues - National Bank Employee Dies of Plague, Remittances Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office announced that, in order to prevent the spread of cholera, the authorities of the International Settlement had previously announced three measures on the 5th of this month regarding the lockdown of infected houses for five days. Details can be found in the newspapers of the 6th of this month. Now, Dr. Tashiro, the newly appointed Director of the Public Health Department, in order to minimize inconvenience to the residents concerned, has drafted three measures which have been approved and implemented by the Chairman of the Council:</p>
<p>Scope of Lockdown</p>
<p>The scope of the lockdown of infected housing shall be minimized as much as possible in order to reduce the inconvenience to residents in the locked-down housing. If the house where cholera occurs is an apartment, the scope of the lockdown shall be limited to the house where the patient's family lives. If the house where cholera occurs is a hotel, boarding house or other similar place where the owner provides food, the entire building shall be locked down.</p>
<p>Cholera Hospitals</p>
<p>The announcement also stated that private hospitals within the International Settlement are not allowed to admit cholera patients. The citizens within the Settlement who contract cholera should be sent to any of the following isolation hospitals for treatment: Chinese Isolation Hospital, 162 North Hai Road; Chinese Isolation Hospital, 1461 New Gate Road; Chinese Isolation Hospital, 9 Singapore Road; Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, 25 Yu Qiaqing Road; Zhenxin Cholera Hospital, 252 Tianjin Road; Shanghai Emergency Epidemic Hospital, 730 Wenjianshi Road.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the two Chinese Isolation Hospitals on North Hai Road and New Gate Road are now full and will not accept any more patients until further notice. The Shanghai Emergency Epidemic Hospital has recently been added to the "Cholera Hospital" list. The Cholera Hospital at 9 Singapore Road (the original site of the Chinese Girls' Middle School) opened on the 8th of this month. All the facilities meet the requirements of the Council and are quite suitable for a hospital. The hospital admitted a total of 52 patients in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>Areas Affected by the Epidemic</p>
<p>There have been no new developments regarding the lockdown area of Kangti Road. There are approximately 25,000 Chinese residents in the area, mostly from the impoverished class. Currently, except for work and buying groceries, they are not allowed to enter or exit. Of the six cholera cases found in the area, three have already died. The Guofu Bank on Beijing Road has been locked down by the authorities due to the death of an employee named Shen from the epidemic in Zhenxin Hospital, and no one is allowed to enter or exit, so the bank's receipts and payments have been temporarily suspended for several days. It is reported that the epidemic prevention patrol team is very strict in checking epidemic prevention certificates. If they find citizens without certificates or with expired certificates of three months, they will all be detained and taken to nearby injection sites for compulsory injection. Yesterday, epidemic prevention certificates were strictly checked in the Nanjing Road area. Those without certificates were given compulsory injections. Therefore, citizens who have not yet received the second epidemic prevention injection should receive the injection as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Emergency Evacuation of Coffins from Eastern Zhejiang</p>
<p>Since the Coffin Transportation Department of the Guohua Funeral Parlor was ordered to handle the evacuation of coffins stored in Shanghai, the results have been remarkable and have been met with deep satisfaction from all parties. The registration of the poor is especially appreciated by the public. However, due to the arduous nature of the work, it was originally planned to start with Ningbo. Now, due to the rampant epidemic, the evacuation of corpses has become a necessary measure to eliminate the epidemic. Therefore, the department has issued an urgent announcement that all coffins from Eastern Zhejiang, including Shaoxing, Yuyao, Baiguan, Cixi, Zhenhai, Fenghua, Xiangshan, Dinghai, and Ningbo, are urgently being evacuated. If the coffin owners are poor, they can still apply for free or reduced-cost transportation. The coffins of those without family members in funeral parlors, coffin storage facilities, guild halls, and public offices should be compiled into a list within one month and evacuated by the department. Regarding the recent proposal in various newspapers for mass cremation to eradicate the epidemic, it is said that the department is designing it meticulously. The fourteenth evacuation on the 12th of this month has been decided to be carried out in large batches by the Xinning Shao steamboat.</p>
<h3>If You Encounter Difficulties When Obtaining Identity Cards, etc., You Are Allowed to Report It - Necessary Measures to Rectify the Ba甲 System</h3>
<p>The General Office of the Mailan Ba甲 District in the French Concession issued a notice yesterday stating, "Regarding the matter of issuing a notice, it has recently been heard that some residents in this district are deliberately made difficult by the 保甲 and household heads (sub-landlords) when obtaining identity cards, rice purchase certificates, movement permits, and other matters. This is not right. In order to rectify the system, the head of this district allows all residents to write a letter with the detailed situation and bring it in person to this office at 25 Zhubao San Road for investigation. Furthermore, if any residents have any questions about the regulations for compiling the Ba甲, they can also ask this office. This notice, as for the rumors that those handling the Ba甲 are forcibly selling 派司套 and extorting donations, the relevant authorities are investigating."</p>
<h3>Early Autumn, the East Wind Blows Tightly - The Weather May Turn Cool and Refreshing - Yesterday's Highest Temperature was 95.7 Degrees, Cold Drinks are No Longer Suitable, Exercise Caution in Daily Life</h3>
<p>Yesterday's highest temperature, according to the observatory's record, was 95.7 degrees Fahrenheit, which was lower than the previous day's 98.6 degrees. The east wind blew slowly all day long, and there were陣 clouds at noon. Although the sunlight did not retreat, there were slight sparse raindrops around 4:00 pm, which stopped soon after. There were slight raindrops again at 6:00 pm in the evening. Due to the blowing of the east wind, the陣 clouds appeared and disappeared from time to time.

<h3>Consumption of Flour and Bread Should be Conserved - Twelve Measures for the Use of Bread Cards are Specified</h3>
<p>The Information Office of the Municipal Council announced that, in order to prevent the misuse of flour allocated for baking bread, the following twelve regulations have been drawn up and should be strictly followed by all relevant parties:</p>
<p>Bread Cards Should be Carefully Guarded</p>
<p>"Bread Supply Cards" are important documents and should be carefully kept by the holder, just like other identification documents. Bread cards are not allowed to be kept in bakeries or their distribution stores. Bakeries and their distribution stores do not need to send bread cards to their registered customers; each registered customer should pick them up in person. The stubs of bread cards collected by bread retail stores should be sent to the following offices: "(A) Bread Distribution Office, Room 160B, 209 Jiangxi Road, Municipal Council Building, or (B) Food and Price Control Office of the French Concession Authorities, 2 Fuli Li Road, French Concession."</p>
<p>Violation of Rules Will Result in License Revocation</p>
<p>Bakeries and their distribution stores that sell bread without collecting the corresponding number of bread card stubs will be in violation of these rules and will be subject to license revocation. If a bread card holder entrusts their servant to collect bread, the holder will be fully responsible for any errors or deliberate violations of these rules by the servant. If the number indicated on the stubs submitted by a bread card holder exceeds the amount of bread they should receive, their right to participate in any current or future bread distribution program will be cancelled.</p>
<p>The Respective Stores Should be Held Responsible</p>
<p>Bakeries are responsible for all actions of their distribution stores. Bakeries and their distribution stores should collect the same number of bread card stubs as the amount of bread sold at the same time. Bakeries should keep a record of the amount of bread baked each day, noting the number of breads of each fixed weight, such as white bread, brown bread, or rye bread. If the bakeries do not comply with this, the Council may refuse to supply flour. The authorities will only allocate flour according to the amount of flour used to manufacture the various types of bread mentioned above.</p>
<p>Flour Reserves Should be Maintained for a Long Time</p>
<p>The amount of flour allocated according to the current method has not decreased compared to the amount of flour used for baking bread in the past. Consumers should try to reduce bread consumption as much as possible and use bread certificates, so that this satisfactory flour distribution method can continue to be maintained and the bread distribution plan will not be hindered. In order to maintain flour reserves for a long time, the authorities hope that citizens will report immediately if they find bakeries and confectioneries using all or part of the flour to make cakes and other items. If any violations of the bread distribution plan are encountered, please report them truthfully for investigation.</p>

<h3>Woolen Fabrics Continue to Decline</h3>

As a result, the market is unusually sluggish, and transactions are quite slow. Most men's and women's colored, thick and thin fabrics are fortunate to avoid further price declines.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Sugar Merchants Cooperative's sugar shares opened for trading. As it was Monday, sentiment was good. Coarse sugar shares opened at 299 yuan and then rose by 0.5 yuan, 1 yuan higher than the closing price on the previous weekend. Red sugar shares traded at 285 yuan. A total of 900 packages were traded. Purchase certificates for sugar purchased by retailers this month can be issued today (the 11th), and the payments must be made by the 15th of this month. The prices are the same as last month and have not changed.</p>
<p>Ningbo Dried Mussels Offered Fresh</p>
<p>Ningbo dried mussels have been in short supply due to a poor harvest this year. It is reported that some shops have obtained five or six loads of bulk goods, which are also sorted into large and small sizes for sale.</p>
<p>Shaanxi Black Moss Arrives</p>
<p>Twenty loads of Shaanxi black moss have recently arrived. The quality is quite dry, and the market price is 2,100 yuan, but no transactions have been seen due to the high asking price.</p>
<h3>Small Tinplate Purchases are Quite Active</h3>
<p>The market supply of 90-pound and 100-pound single-linked small tinplate has been scarce for some time. Yesterday, there was a surge in inquiries and purchases, mostly from small hardware stores buying in bulk. As a result, the market was lively, with busy trading. However, the numbers were not large, but the market sentiment was quite firm. Therefore, dealers had good expectations, and the standard market price showed a slight firming. Currently, each box containing 112 sheets is sold for 1,200 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes, with retail prices ranging from 12 yuan to 14 yuan per sheet. Double-linked plates, 20 inches by 28 inches, also containing 112 sheets per box, are priced at 2,300 yuan to 2,400 yuan, but the supply of genuine tinplate in the city is very limited. Most of what is referred to as double-linked plates in Shanghai is actually re-packed in Shanghai. Very few factories in this city use genuine goods, so the trade is now commonplace.</p>

<h3>How to Utilize Free Time</h3>
<p>— Hai Lin</p>
<p>(The Youth Department of the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association holds a rooftop cool-off gathering every Saturday evening at 8 PM on the tenth floor. The first gathering was on August 1st. The association invited Mr. Chen Rongsheng to give a lecture on the topic of how to utilize free time. Due to the limited space on the rooftop, only a few people could attend. The topic is one that every young person should study, especially during this long summer vacation. It would be a pity not to know how to utilize it. Therefore, I am introducing it to many young friends for reference. However, due to the lecture being held on the rooftop, I was unable to take notes on the spot in the dark. Based on my memory, I have made a brief record as follows:)</p>
<p>The people in the world can be divided into two categories: one category is busy people who are busy all day long for their careers and for society. These people are doctors, lawyers, teachers, workers, farmers... and employees in any company. They benefit society and serve humanity and are indispensable people in the world. The other category is idle people who are idle all day long. They are merely parasites of society, only able to consume and have no productive capacity. Vagrants and beggars are examples of this. These people are naturally unnecessary, and they are bound to be eliminated in the long run.</p>
<p>The successors of these two categories of people are our young people. Everyone has to choose one of these two paths. Of course, we hope to become busy people in the future, not idle people. Yes, being too idle will deplete a person's vitality and strength. Especially during this period of training, we must not relax our efforts and allow idleness to occupy us. Young people only feel that time is too short and insufficient, and will never feel that time is too long and allow it to be idle.</p>
<p>But how exactly do we utilize free time? I believe we can start with the four words in the motto of the Youth Department of the Youth Association: "Virtue, Wisdom, Body, and Community." A young person who possesses all four of these qualities is the ideal person, and society, the country, and humanity all need him to improve.</p>
<p>Virtue: Virtue means morality, character, and ethical conduct. A person with good morals is more valuable than any material treasure. Without it, no matter how profound your knowledge or how strong your body, you are equivalent to a useless person. The world does not need people without morals to exist. For example, if you want to hire an accountant, there are two people for you to choose from. One is a highly knowledgeable accounting talent who can do both Chinese and Western bookkeeping, but he likes to "skim off the top." The other only knows Chinese bookkeeping, but he has noble character and integrity and will never take unjust wealth. Which one would you hire? The latter, without a doubt. This example tells us that having heaven-high knowledge without morality is still being a useless person. Moreover, a person with bad character often has his ability to do evil strengthened by his knowledge. For example, the two brothers in the Father Murder case. If they did not have profound knowledge, they would not have been able to think of using electricity to cause someone's death, nor would they have been able to think of using nitric acid to destroy the body in order to escape punishment. This example tells us that having good knowledge is harmful to him, and it can be understood that virtue is greater than everything else. Now that we have free time, we should use it to cultivate morality, pay attention to our behavior in all places, read more books on self-cultivation and biographies of famous people, and emulate them, in order to cultivate ourselves into people with noble character.</p>
<p>Wisdom: When you are studying, you may complain that you have to do thirty or forty arithmetic problems every day, working yourself to death, and you don't even have time to read some useful extracurricular books! So friends, now it's summer vacation, and you don't have so much homework to do. With a free mind and tireless eyes, you can really make good use of it and fulfill your wishes when you are busy. There are many useful books and many practical skills that you can learn. You must know that it is not easy to find a way out in modern society. It all depends on testing your true talents. Even a trainee position that an elementary school student can take on requires you to pass an exam at the level of a university student. "The superior wins, the inferior are deceived" This rule will be even more pronounced in the future. Quickly use your free time to gain more knowledge. Learning has no limit, so try to acquire as much as possible!</p>
<p>Body: You must know that having a sound body is necessary to achieve a great career. Otherwise, if you have good knowledge and good morals, but your body is weak, how can you contribute your skills to society? Wouldn't you just have to "sigh at your aspirations but be unable to act on them?" Now that it is summer, it is a good time to exercise. You don't necessarily need a gym to exercise, but rather consistency. Then, helping out with household chores is the best method. Currently, every family is reducing the number of servants due to rice shortages. If you can take over part of the work for your parents, how happy they will be! On the one hand, you can exercise your body without interruption, which will definitely be of great help to your health in the future. On the other hand, being able to live in a harmonious family and gain happiness in body and mind is also a method of fitness.</p>
<p>Community: Community means making more beneficial friends. As an old saying goes, "Rely on your parents at home, and rely on your friends when you go out." But relying on your parents is only for about twenty years at most, and the rest of your life, minus those twenty years, is entirely dependent on friends. If a person can make a confidant in his life, the gains are significant. When you are in pain, he will come to comfort you. When you fail in your career, he will come to encourage and help you. This kind of friendship that money cannot buy is inexhaustible for a lifetime. But what is needed are beneficial friends, not friends who are only for drinking and eating. Choosing friends is also one of the things you should pay attention to in life. Otherwise, many people become degenerates due to making bad friends. Therefore, it takes a long time to observe in order to gain a confidant. As the proverb says, "Distance tests a horse's strength, and time reveals a person's heart!" This is what it means. Now everyone should take advantage of this free time to make beneficial friends, and the future mutual assistance will be inexpressible.</p>
<p>Finally, I advise everyone to hoard goods, but don't misunderstand. I don't want everyone to hoard daily necessities, but I hope that young people will take advantage of their free time to hoard more virtue, wisdom, body, and community. Hoarding these things will not only not get you scolded as a profiteer, but it is also a good business of hoarding that everyone advises people to do, and you will definitely make a fortune in the future. Hoard as much as possible!</p>
<h3>Eating and Being a Person</h3>
<p>— Yi Min</p>
<p>There are two important things in life: eating and being a person. You cannot succeed in being a person without eating. If you only eat and do not live well, you are called a "rice bucket."</p>
<p>I once saw a couplet hung in a restaurant in Beiping, which read: "Enlarge your belly to eat, and stand firm to be a person." Perhaps the phrase "enlarge your belly" is for the restaurant to attract business, but upon careful thought, these two sentences are also profound truths.</p>
<p>But now, eating is not as easy as it used to be! It takes a lot of effort to get a full meal. How can we "enlarge our belly"?</p>
<p>However, we can be alive for one day, so we must do our duty and be a person for one day, which is what we owe to our true and valuable life. Therefore, we might as well change the above couplet to: "Tighten your belt to eat, and stand firm to be a person." As our motto in this extraordinary period.</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— Zhi Zheng</p>
<p>What is a road? It is trampled out from places where there are no roads, and opened up from places where there are only thorns!</p>
<p>One must survive, two must have adequate food and clothing, and three must develop. Survival is not just living, adequate food and clothing is not luxury, and development is not indulgence.</p>
<p>If you want to survive, you must study!</p>
<p>Only through physical labor can you gain health and promote human solidarity.</p>
<p>Hesitation is worse than recklessness; those who learn to shoot may sometimes hit the target, but those who do not take action will never hit the target.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat in Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(7) Sudden Thunder</p>
<p>Mrs. Ye II and Cuizhen went through all the rooms in which Wei Cheng normally sat and lived, and confirmed that Wei Cheng and A Xing had gone out into the snow at night. It was not until a piece of paper was found under the glass mat in Wei Cheng's bedroom, with Wei Cheng's confession, that half of their leaping hearts were put down. On the paper, these few lines were scribbled: "I have a need to visit my brothers and sisters Guo Qi and Guo Fang. However, I am worried that my aunt will not allow it, so I am taking A Xing out on a snowy night. This trip is to Shuangqiao. Why must I travel on a snowy night, and why must I be in Shuangqiao? Someday, my aunt will know. When Cuizhen or other maids and servants discover it tomorrow morning, they should first present this paper to Mrs. Ye II for inspection, so that she can feel at ease. I am going to Shuangqiao with a strong servant, so I am not worried about falling or other dangers. If I do not return by tomorrow evening, I will definitely return by the morning of the day after tomorrow. Wei Cheng left this note. January 28, night."</p>
<p>Mrs. Ye II pursed her lips and said, "Why didn't this child consult with anyone before taking A Xing away? A Xing is the worst. He is not a three-year-old child. He knows that it is snowing and that the weather is so cold. If the young master wants him to go, does he just follow along? When he comes back, I will have to scold him thoroughly!" Cuizhen said, "Second Aunt, don't be angry. I was startled at first, but now I know that he is going to Shuangqiao, and he has A Xing to accompany him, so I am relieved." Mrs. Ye II said, "How can you walk on a snowy road? It says in the novel that Fang Qing fell in the snow, didn't he? And there's that play, South Gate." Mrs. Ye II was still quoting the ancients to prove the present, but Cuizhen was already in Wei Cheng's room, knowing that Wei Cheng was wearing his thick-soled cotton shoes, and also brought an umbrella, a flashlight, and a cane. Later, she also found that he had brought goggles and a Western-style raincoat; although the Western-style raincoat was not as long as a cotton robe, it could still be worn to ward off the cold and rain. Cuizhen was telling Mrs. Ye II about them one by one, and Mrs. Ye II felt a little more relieved. (51)</p>
<h3>Season of Joyful Rain</h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>This year's drought is said to have broken the highest record of the Republic of China in 1935. In the cities, epidemics are rampant; in the countryside, the rice crops are all withered, and the people's hope for rain clouds is unparalleled. Sure enough, at noon the day before yesterday, floating clouds gathered, and the north wind came slowly. The country people did not understand astronomy, but they recognized the will of Heaven. My family's old nanny was the first to joyfully report to the crowd: "It's going to rain!"</p>
<p>From 11:35 AM, the sky began to pour down sweet rain. Although intermittent and drizzling, it only rained for ten minutes, and everyone's joy was self-evident. Some said: "This is a sample, maybe it will rain heavily tonight!" Some said: "It's good to cool off!" Some also said, "Autumn begins in two days, this is called 'pre-autumn rain', there will be no problem in the fields!"</p>
<p>Winter is lovely, the summer breeze is pleasant, and the hope for rain during a great drought is naturally the same!</p>
<h3>Cremation</h3>
<p>— Yin Yu</p>
<p>A relative's father died, "everything was kept simple," but just a thin, not-so-good coffin caused him to incur a debt of C.R.B. six thousand yuan.</p>
<p>When alive, he didn't pay much attention to life, but after death, he treated the corpse as a treasure.</p>
<p>People must live, but they must also die.</p>
<p>The dead should not burden the living to die.</p>
<p>Letting a beautiful, dazzling fire burn one's corpse into a pile of ashes, instead of rotting together with a log, is better, isn't it?</p>
<h3>Hot indeed! Terribly hot!</h3>
<p>— A Heat-Fearing Guest</p>
<p>Pulling a rickshaw: My feet feel like they're walking on boiling oil, yet the master still complains I'm slow as an ant on a hot stone.</p>
<p>Street vendor: Cold drinks, selling water! Shouting at the top of my lungs, ice blocks and ice pops sell out quickly, the price is high, but business is surprisingly good.</p>
<p>Young master: Watermelon and cold drinks; eating and drinking non-stop, yet still complaining his stomach feels like a furnace.</p>
<p>Young miss: Electric fan, doesn't feel cool when blowing on me, quickly build a big icebox, so I can hide inside and avoid the sun.</p>
<p>Rich man: In the bamboo forest, playing mahjong; under the shade of the trees, seeking coolness; even with cool mats and bamboo beds, he still complains of the heat, building ice walls all around.</p>
<p>Madam: Fanning with her left hand, blowing with her right, thin silk dress, light gauze pants, cool breeze seeping into every pore; bossing the servants around, complaining they're too slow.</p>
<p>Farmer: Everyone else can go and enjoy the cool, but I'm toiling in the scorching sun, working doubly hard in the fields.</p>
<p>Water bailer: The fields lack water and need watering, who knows that even if I bail water with all my might, it's still less than the sweat pouring off my body.</p>
<p>Ox: Day and night, endlessly turning the waterwheel, at night looking at the moon and still panting.</p>
<p>Cold drink shop: Ha! You all fear the heat, but I welcome it, selling several big boxes of soda, and hundreds of dozens of wrapped ice pops.</p>
<p>Watermelon vendor: Heh! You complained one hundred yuan for a load of watermelons was too expensive, now they sell for two hundred and forty, and still sell like hotcakes!</p>
<p>Doctor: Good! You fear the heat, eat cold drinks, seek coolness, resulting in a big illness, which makes my business boom, scooping up five hundred, a thousand in my bag.</p>
<p>Pharmacist: Oh! Your good fortune is mine, worried about the lack of general health, truly happy in my heart.</p>
<p>Coffin merchant: Alas! It's a pity there's a shortage of wood, otherwise, a ten-fold profit on a small investment, where else can you find such a good business!</p>
<p>The masses: Humph! You bunch of black-hearted people, rejoicing in others' misfortune, Heaven will not protect you, and you dare feign kindness and say such heartless things!</p>
<p>Jade Emperor: Seeing the hot air rising from the lower realm, not without resentful energy, summon the gods in charge of the stars to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>Venus: Your humble servant is ordered to summon, all the gods are gathered, let's hear their respective reports.</p>
<p>God of Rain: It's not that I don't send rain, but the God of Clouds doesn't spread clouds, the Winds don't cooperate, and the Thunder God and his wife don't help, I alone am powerless.</p>
<p>God of Clouds: The sun is so fierce, all the moisture in the air evaporates, how can I accumulate it into clouds.</p>
<p>God of Wind: Originally, I ordered Pacific hurricanes to come here often to regulate the temperature and spread rain, but this year's meteorological communication was flawed, I fear sudden wind and rain, and the people have no precautions, so last time I reached Shanghai, I turned around and went elsewhere.</p>
<p>Thunder God and Thunder Mother: Just because we went to Shanghai on the first month of the year, and unintentionally caused criticism, we might as well disappear and avoid the limelight.</p>
<p>Drought Demon: Sun Star Lord, you are truly my benefactor, otherwise, how would I have a chance to rise.</p>
<p>God of Plague: The hotter the weather, the better the opportunity for my children to thrive, they are too vigilant against me, I specially use my divine power to show them.</p>
<p>Celestial Physician Star: So that's the reason, no wonder my disciples and grandsons benefit a lot.</p>
<p>Medicine King: My few young apprentices are also getting some advantages.</p>
<p>Jade Emperor: Alas! It is my children who suffer!</p>
