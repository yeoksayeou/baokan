<p>— 甘草</p>
<p>壬午年是馬年，合該馬浪堂先生當令，自從去年十二月初失業像潮水那麽奔騰而來後，今年便成爲改行年了。住在上海的人，據說早知道上海灘是要變爲上海坍的，對於上海倒也並不戀戀不捨，實在因爲失了業之後，如何維持家大小的生活才是不容拖延解決的大問題。如果家鄉有飯吃，那末自然回鄕咯，所苦的出走了多年的家鄕呀，早已一無錢物可以供給生活的了，於是只好膩在上海，另找生路，找生活只有拜馬浪堂先生做師傅，改行吧，行行出狀元，三百六十行，總有一行司做的吧，大家都是這樣想法。</p>
<p>原來「改行」一句話，是平日做生意人到年底大結賬時的一句牢騷，那裏真會改行，可是今年是馬浪堂先生當令，改行却不是一句空話，而是實際的行爲了。汽車行開不成，改行做脚踏車生意，總算同是車業，只是車輛不同罷了。像亞爾培路揚子汽車行，闢出店基一半的地盤改營地貨業，敏體尼蔭路祥生車行也改爲地貨店，那是從「行」業改到「食」業，那是眞正的改行。</p>
<p>平時跑跑到埠的外洋輪船做洋裝生意的老板，有的改業，民船的運輸有的改業爲菜館，那是從衣業轉變到「行業」和「食業」去了。可是原來是食業的包飯作，也有改行到衣業等等去的呢。有個書店老板，聽說要改行南貨業。他改業的理由是，經營南貨不怕沒生意，糖啊，花生啊，黃豆啊，聞洋啊，一般家庭總要買的。就是做不成生意時，所有的底貨，也可權當飯吃，暫時充飢，不必担憂，關在店堂裏餓死。</p>
<p>改行改得很得法的也很多，例如原來做銀行生意的改做文具商，一切文具居然日長夜大，誓如像複寫紙從十多塊錢一匣，竟漲一百二十元，還是缺貨，一元左右一瓶的花旗貨墨水竟漲至十元左右，聽聽也要嚇人。原來洋行高級職員改行做肥皂洋燭生意，影戲院老板收買外國藥品，囤積顏料，日日看漲，身邊麥克麥克，長袖善舞，倒底不差。</p>
<p>俗語說「百無一用是書生」，然而有辦法的書生，居然還有辦法，寫得一筆楷書的，就開起書法學校來，全日吟詩作文的開國文補習班，善洋涇浜英語者做公館敎師。年輕的女書生更有辦法，索性做舞女，當藝員，更有真才的會囤化妝品。但是除開女性書生外，書生的改行，總是跳不出筆墨的圈套。改行改得最好最聰明的書生，要推爲改業星相。當此人荒馬亂之時愈始被弄得沒辦法愈是想碰運氣。因爲想碰運氣，榻便宜，愈是見神見鬼，拆字算命正是投其所好。在上海有那麽多的想碰運氣的人，做星相還怕沒有生意嗎，發財是意中事，筆者有見於此，對於星相之學進了速成科，居然大有效騐，據筆者硏究所得，推算壬午年的流年，一言以蔽之，應該拜馬浪堂先生做師傅，就是改行，改行，謂金不信，請拭目以待。</p>

<p>至於這種漿果的風味，顏色，和種類，我國古時人已竟論列的很爲詳盡了。普嵇含在南方草木狀上說：「甘蕉，……剝其子皮，色黃白，味似葡萄，甜而脆，亦療飢。此有三種：子大如拇指，長而銳，有類羊角，名「羊角蕉」，味最甘好。一種子大如鵝卵，有類牛乳，名一牛乳蕉微减羊角。</p>

<h3 id="c54">來自田間 <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— 周默</p>
<p>在生活高漲下，誰都感到長安不易居，於是失業之羣，只有肩挑負　，往來於近郊上海之問，提兩斗國米，以濟上海民食；曾經讀過幾年書的人，一想起就是歸去來兮，田園將蕪胡不歸，田園寥落，骨肉流離這一類話。可是因爲到處的物價上漲，要是自許爲「臣本布衣，躬耕南陽」，在這個年豐而妻啼飢，冬暖而兒號寒，叫這位布衣之士，優閑躬耕，勢亦不易，只有牧童初解之無，尙有牛角掛書的雅興，這都是詩書誤我，今昔異勢，　論到將來「三顧臣於草廬之中」，這種不虞之遇，當然是縱然有此夢想，也不能到此境界，可是回頭一想，也惟有自慚形穢，甘與草木同朽而已。</p>
<p>多少人多是來自田間，就連我也不必引爲光榮，更不必引爲恥辱。當然是田家子弟，在我們幼年，常常覺得鄕間　存古風，不免興禮失而求諸野之感，我們的長輩，從不懂囤積，亦不知詐欺，大家相養以生，相守以死，後來發覺有都市可以逍遙，可以謀利，甚至可以謀得」切塡滿慾望的專情，人孰無情，寗能遣此，於是把我們這般後生可畏者，來見見世面，躬耕變成痴子，自有佃戶代勞，來自田問，就成爲奔馳洋塲，有時平旦之氣未消，也不免要有所爲何來之慨，可是也只是慨然而已，何嘗有披髮入山之意呢。</p>
<p>二十年來，見過了不少世面，嘗過了不少世味，爲了生活問題，重新記起我是來自田間，蔓草荒烟，不知故里成何景象，少小離家，鄕音無改，我如歸去，又不知兒童又將相見不相識，笑問客從何處來了</p>
<p>返鄕運動聲中，凡是米煤都成問題的人，我們雖然也有同是天涯淪落人，相逢何必曾相識的情調，却也自然要想到不如歸去，可是要像陶淵明這樣園日涉以成趣，門雖設而常關的避絕塵囂，息交絕游，還要樂夫天命復奚疑，自然不是阮囊羞澀的人所能做到的。</p>
<p>回到田間，重新把鐵銹的種田工具拿起，不要說從事生產的大話，但求個人溫飽，免得劃粥而食，那末今日一念的來自田問，不就是明日的歸自都市嗎？</p>

<h3 id="c55">花鼓戲 <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— 澤夫</p>
<p>花鼓戲為湖北湖南所盛行之小戲，性質與北之秧歌，南方之　　相同。源或謂湖北由於當地之牧歌，湖南由於廣西之採茶歌，故名稱雖同，而唱法各異。湖北昔時除鑼鼓外，完全不用他種樂器，唱時猶如高腔，每至末了，即由塲面人爲之幫腔。湖南則鑼鼓以外，有胡琴伴奏，唱時並無幫腔，一如普通歌曲。惟近年以來，湖北之花鼓戲亦大加改革，廢除幫腔，而佐以京胡，且爲示別舊時花鼓戲起見，改名楚劇。所演劇本，昔時多爲戀愛故事，如「英台哭靈」，「金蓮戲叔」，「十二相思」之類，今則注重倫常道德，亦演「屈原投江」，「董永賣身」一類歷史新劇。惟湖南之花鼓戲，迄今仍維持其原始之色彩，完全無歷史上之大人物可言。如「張三盤姐」，「藍橋汲水」，「和尙化緣」等等，皆無非男女相悅之事，以及滑稽諧　，爲大衆所熟見之人物也。</p>
<h3 id="c56">女人·狗·男人 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— 錢昌年</p>
<p>他是一位靑年男人，他最審怕的東西是狗，而最喜歡的是女人。</p>
<p>他認識了一位女友，年輕而且漂亮。有一晚，他和她手牽着手的在街道上散步，突然有一隻凶猛的獵犬向她奔撲過來，當時他不知從那兒來的勇氣，一脚便將牠踢開去了。從此以後，他不再怕狗了，但是，女人仍然是他最鐘愛的</p>
<p>終有這樣的一日，他的那位女友成爲別一個男人的太太，於是他沒奈何地整天到晚都在和新購得來的一頭小狗嬉戲。</p>
<p>再往後又怎樣呢？據說這位靑年巳經把原有的主張改變了，因爲他發覺犬是永遠忠實地追隨着牠的主人的，牠從不會像女人那樣聰明。</p>
<p>現在，他最害怕的東西是女人，而最喜歡的却是狗了。</p>

<p>— 臨</p>
<p>小學敎師得和小朋友們的生活打成一片，她得注意每一個小朋友的生活狀况。薛寶珠是個好學生，可是近來好幾個星期六下午的一課常識，她總缺席。梁先生再三問她，她總是搖搖兩條整潔辮子的頭　，眼睛裏射出一種「老成」的光芒</p>
<p>梁先生生不着頭腦，跑到薛家去作一次訪問，接見她的是薛太太。她把薛寶珠所以曠課的原因展開：</p>
<p>一梁先生，店裏買不到煤球，家中煤球已經燒完，以前張媽早上大淸早到煤球廠排隊，偶然也可以買到半担。近來可不成了，早上趕去，票子早已發完，聽說人家都是排隊過夜，生米總不能吃的，我見寶珠星期六下午只有一課，就叫她吃了午飯去排隊，隊伍已經老長。她不願意缺課，可是我也沒有法子，吃過夜飯，張媽去換寳珠回家吃飯睡覺。張媽不肯等過夜，說要等過夜寗願不幫人家，只好在戒嚴之前，我自己去換張媽回來，夜裏兩點鐘寫號碼，明早六點鐘發票子，然後憑票去買煤球。人家都說煤球怕要沒得賣，所以這幾個星期只好讓寳珠缺一些課，請梁先生有空給她補補。」</p>
<p>梁先生吿別後走在路上，心中不禁忖度：自己也常常走過買煤球的隊伍，可是從沒有想到隊伍中會有一個是自己的高足，小學生在學校操塲上玩接力賽跑，最最起勁的是寳珠，想不到她又在學校外的廣塲上作生存的接力競爭，但願她也像在學校中一樣時奏凱歌。</p>

<p>（二）悲與喜</p>
<p>街上漸漸有了行人，雜糧行也在開門。他抬頭一看，陽光普照了大地，隔河的竹葉上和樹幹上，都像在淌汗。河面起了一重微波，被陽光照射着的半邊，一閃一閃，閃出像圖案似的美麗。他把布傘往地下一撑，站起來就走，走出市梢。迎面來了幾個人，其中一個，喚一聲葉少爺，維城點頭和他招呼道：「到鎭上來嗎？路上還沒有怎麽乾燥，天倒是好了。快到年底，誰都是盼望天晴。」那人也說了幾句尋常酬應的話，擦身走過了。維城對鄉裏人敷衍，也學曾了這一套。仔細想想，那人認得自己，自己却無論怎樣還想不起他姓什麼。</p>
<p>一枝箭射得到的地方，是不會走多少時間的。維城懷着一顆喜悅的心，載欣載奔，一會兒望見四周給幾十株槎枒老樹包圍着的，烏黑的是屋頂，粉白的是牆垣，還有矛　森然的是籬笆，那便是維城的家世德堂葉府。他踏着脚底下的田岸，田裹怒茁的麥芽，葉子綠得可愛，它受了陽光的溫煦，寒風的震盪，像是耍從田裏站起來奔跑。維城知道這田是葉氏列代祖先傳下來的遺產，現在由母親叔母共同管理着，幾個長工和老媽子耕耘着。他又脊些　然了。</p>
<p>越走越近，走到籬門，鬥口站着幾個家人：有兩個瞧見了維城，便奔進去；一個是長工阿興，迎上來喚少爺。見維城手裏沒有什麽衣包提箱之類，就把那頂傘接了去，說：「少爺倒回來的早，大太太二太太說，少爺快回來了，早知道是今天回來，我就上花港來接。」維城走進籬門，一個廣塲上，停了一輛手車，維城道：「是誰的車？」阿興走在前面，沒有回答。走過大門二門，他還是依着他的老例，走進位置在客廳西邊的雙梅書屋，對他父親愛棠公遺像，虔誠地三鞠躬。（一八）</p>

<p>預備：苞米粉　黃芽菜　油　鹽　葱蝦米味精製法：將苞米粉用溫水調使糊狀（乾些），黃芽菜洗凈後切塊，蝦米用酒渥過，葱切細末，乃以油和鹽花，蝦米，葱末起油鍋，待熱透先把黃芽菜一炒，再加充份之水燒之，同時將苞米粉糊用刀劃成小方塊，俟菜熟水沸後，卽將苞米糊之塊放入燒透，取食前略加味精，其味必鮮腴適口也。</p>
<p>另一經濟簡單製食法：用少量之米煮粥，另將苞米粉用溫水調成糊狀，待粥滾透，卽以苞米粉糊傾入同燒，如喜食甜者，可趁乎加以黃糖，攪和於苞米粥內，喜　者加鹽，或加菠菜同煮，味精宜於取食前加之。</p>
<p>在此食糧困絀聲中，苞米粉將為上海各階　之主要食品，按苞米一物，營養價値，不在米　之下，惟海上人士，於其製法，都未諳熟，致有米能下　者，　特廣徽苞米　苞米粉之各種製煮方法，不論單純的配合的，以及甜　各味，俱所歡迎，文意務取簡明，一經採刋，略致薄酬。稿寄派克路協和里十二號本食譜編輯部，諸君如欲購買天廚廠出品之「味精」，「味宗」，「天廚醬油精液」，「天廚家用　粉」，本市各大公司，各南貨食品店，均有出售。</p>

<p>London, 8th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: The "Observer" newspaper carries a special dispatch from a military correspondent stating that submarines have been discovered in the waters off Bombay, India. General Wavell is currently encountering dual difficulties in India: one is the issue of space, and the other is the issue of manpower. Bombay and Madras are as far apart as London and Smolensk. Most of India's railways are laid along the coast, making the situation precarious. Furthermore, despite India's vast territory, its military equipment is only comparable to that of New Zealand, and it lacks heavy artillery, airplanes, tanks, and other weapons, making it extremely dependent on overseas supplies.</p>

<p>Bennett Warns Against Repeating the Mistakes of Malaya</p>
<p>Sydney, 8th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: Major General Bennett, the former commander of Australian forces in Malaya, gave a broadcast speech here, discussing the issue of the Japanese invasion of Australia. He believes that Japan is most likely to attack the weakest point of Australia's continental defenses first. He said, "As far as I can see, the first step will be to attempt to occupy Broome, Wyndham, Darwin Port, and various air force bases in northern Queensland, and then advance inland along the airfields. We must prevent them from establishing a foothold in Australia and prevent them from launching attacks on our inland cities from the northern airfields. In short, we should not concentrate all our forces and all our residents in the southern regions."</p>
<p>Sydney, 9th, Reuters News Agency Dispatch: Major General Bennett, the former commander of Australian forces in the Malayan region, telegraphed from here yesterday that time is of the essence and the situation is critical. We cannot waste valuable time debating the merits and demerits of the two battles of Malaya and Singapore. The fundamental reason for the defeat in the Malayan campaign was "wishful thinking." Certain important officials wrongly assumed that the Japanese had no intention of attacking Malaya, so defenses were lax. They also believed that the Japanese would choose a convenient place to attack, so the "wishful thinking faction" attempted to defend Singapore on the ocean side. They also believed that the Japanese air force's strength was insufficient, but this was not the case. Australia cannot repeat this mistake and must quickly take all necessary steps to avoid becoming a continuation of Malaya.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 9th, Haito News Agency Dispatch: A London correspondent for a Swedish newspaper reports that London is discussing what target the Japanese army will attack after capturing Java. Most military experts in London believe that after capturing Java, the Japanese will first attack Darwin Port, and then concentrate naval and land forces to attack India.</p>

<p>Sofia, 8th, Havas Dispatch: According to informed sources, Japanese Ambassador to Germany, General Oshima, may travel to the Turkish capital within the week to hold talks with Turkish authorities and the Japanese Ambassador to Turkey. Oshima's trip is likely related to the recall of the Turkish Ambassador to Germany, Jerad. At the same time, it is generally believed here that the Japanese ambassador's trip is also related to the previous joint talks between the Japanese and German ambassadors to Turkey with Turkish Foreign Minister La茹格鲁 on the 20th of last month, which is therefore more important. It is widely believed that the two men met with Turkish President Ismet at that time. In short, in the past few weeks, the activities of the Axis countries in Turkey have intensified. It is rumored that the Axis countries have launched a diplomatic offensive to quickly change the attitude of the Turkish government to approach the Axis countries, which is probably the reason for this.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 9th, Reuters News Agency Dispatch: A Berlin dispatch in a Swedish newspaper stated that there are severe blizzards in Kerch (Crimean Peninsula) and the Donbas region, forcing the war to stop. Snow has begun to melt in some locations on the front lines, but it will take three or four weeks, and military operations are expected to be affected.</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th, Haito News Agency Dispatch: A responsible person here yesterday described the war situation on the Eastern Front the day before, saying that the enemy army had no action on the Sevastopol front, and no important battles occurred in the Kerch area, because there was a heavy snow there.</p>

<p>Swedish Newspaper Observes the Eastern Front War Situation</p>
<p>Stockholm, 9th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: According to a Berlin special dispatch from the Swedish Daily News, German officials have stated that the German spring offensive against the Soviet Union will not be launched until April or the end of May. It may even be delayed until the beginning of June, depending on when the ground dries out. According to normal conditions, drying takes three or four weeks, but because of the heavy snow this winter, there is too much water on the ground, which may take longer. However, the German army will still use sporadic battles to explore the most appropriate starting point for the spring offensive. This preliminary battle will use infantry and not motorized units or armored divisions.</p>
<p>Vichy, 8th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: A military observer here recently stated that the greatest feature of the German-Soviet war is that there are no fixed positions. The troops on both sides are intertwined and deeply complex in the battles in various regions. It is difficult to determine the positions of both sides. This situation of melee is most obvious in the Orel, Smolensk, Valda, and Leningrad urban areas. This also acknowledges at the German headquarters that the "resistance units" left by the German army in the enemy's positions will be in a very important position in the spring offensive. The Red Army, which recaptured 于克诺夫 city a few days ago, is now trying to contact the Red Army that recaptured 洛斯明诺 city (20 miles southeast of Vyazma city). As for the Kerch Peninsula, because the frozen ice in the strait has now begun to melt and become fragile, it is no longer possible to maintain normal traffic. The Red Army cannot obtain reinforcements from the Taman Peninsula, so all opportunities for the Red Army to recapture the Kerch area have been missed.</p>

Refugees from other areas will have the Refugee Association and the Cilian Association obtain travel permits and half-price train and boat tickets on their behalf. Yesterday, a Datong News Agency reporter continued to learn that although the two shelters are actively proceeding with the dismissal, the dismissal procedures are complex. Apart from a small portion who have already been dismissed, the majority are unlikely to be processed before the 15th of this month. Currently, the refugees in the two refugee shelters are being maintained on a diet of two meals of porridge per day.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Coal Briquette Factory Manager Robbed on the Road; Two Thieves Arrested on the Spot; Allegedly Accomplice Driver Provided Inside Information <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the 8th, at 1:40 PM, a robbery of 3,000 yuan from a businessman occurred near Gordon Road and Wuding Road. It was briefly reported in the news. It is now learned that the victim of the case is Han Pihao, a native of Dinghai and the general manager of the Guohua Coal Briquette Factory at No. 668 Machen Road. He goes to the factory every day and has a hired car for transportation. The driver, Chen A'da, a native of Tongzhou, takes him daily from his residence to No. 1394 Rue du Père Robert in the French Concession. Han sometimes carries</p>
<p>Large Sums of Cash</p>
<p>to the factory to be kept by the accountant. These funds are the proceeds from coal briquette transactions with customers. Recently, the hired driver Chen A'da took sick leave and was replaced by his fellow villager, Zhao Xiangfu, as a substitute. On this day, Han Pihao finished lunch at home and went out in his hired car to the factory to work. He had 5,000 yuan in legal tender hidden in two pockets of his overcoat. While traveling near Gordon Road and Wuding Road, two robbers suddenly appeared, one holding a handgun, and stopped him, ordering Han to remain silent. They then snatched 2,900 yuan of legal tender from the pockets of his overcoat. As they were about to search for other valuables, Han shouted for help. One of the robbers then</p>
<p>Opened Fire</p>
<p>Fortunately, he missed, only piercing a hole in the right shoulder of Han's overcoat. The robbers then fled east to west with the stolen money. At this time, two Chinese constables from No. 212 and No. 3091 nearby and Detective Bai Wenqi arrived at the scene after hearing the alarm and gave chase. In desperation, the robbers fired again to escape. The detectives also drew their guns and returned fire. Bullets flew like beads. As a result, the robber fled to Lane 835 of West Lian Road, where the janitor at No. 183 of the lane heard the alarm and cooperated by firing one shot, hitting the robber in the abdomen.</p>
<p>He Fell to the Ground and Was Captured</p>
<p>The man was identified as Li Youshan, a native of Jiangbei. A 32-caliber handgun and seven bullets were seized and handed over to Detective Bai to be taken to the Gordon Road Police Station. Due to the severity of his injuries, he was taken by car to the police hospital for treatment. His accomplice, Lin Peixiang, a native of Wenzhou, was apprehended by a Western constable while fleeing in panic near West Lian Road. After investigating the case at Han's home, Detective Bai and Chief Detective Wang Chengying suspected Zhao Xiangfu, the substitute driver, of conspiring to provide inside information. He was arrested and taken to the police station along with the other suspect, Lin Peixiang, for further investigation.</p>

There are also many poor people who have gone to the society to request assistance to return to their hometowns.

<h3 id="e37">Amidst Food Controls: Current Milk Product Supply; Imported Milk Powder Difficult to Purchase; Domestic "An Jian Er" Substitutes <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Fresh milk, canned milk, and milk powder are consumed in large quantities by middle- and upper-class families, restaurants, and hospitals in this city. Except for fresh milk, which is still supplied as usual, canned milk and milk powder are subject to price controls. While consumers benefit from the lower prices, purchasing them is quite inconvenient. The current supply situation of milk products in this city is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Fresh Milk</p>
<p>Fresh milk is currently not affected by price controls and is supplied as usual. However, it is quite difficult for new customers to subscribe to Grade A milk, as the production of Grade A milk is limited and only sufficient to supply existing subscribers. Currently, there are only a dozen or so Grade A milk producers, such as Ziyou, Shengsheng, Kedi, Xuzhi, and Jieyuan. There are many more Grade B milk producers, numbering several dozen, scattered around western Shanghai. Due to the shortage of canned milk, the consumption of fresh milk is increasing daily.</p>
<p>Canned Milk. Imported brands of canned milk such as "Carnation" are difficult to purchase in the market after the sale was restricted. Some consumers, due to urgent needs, have sought help from others and managed to purchase a few cans at prices exceeding the controlled price. Some have even gone to the Hongkou district to purchase them. The French Concession Health Department has issued a notice that if patients or infants have an urgent need, they can apply to the Health Department on Route de Pélleux with a certificate from a registered doctor. The department will provide them at the controlled price.</p>
<p>Domestic Milk Powder. After overseas transportation was blocked, the source of imported milk powders such as Le Tu Jing, Ailan Baili, and Ke Ning was cut off. With limited stocks in this city, the Municipal Council imposed controls and price limits. Currently, the Shanghai Milk Products Factory's domestic products, An Jian Er and Jin Shi Pi, are available as substitutes. The price is equivalent to the price limit of imported milk powder, and it is available everywhere. The factory manufactures milk powder using fresh milk, which undergoes more than 20 procedures such as milk collection, disinfection, composition testing, congealing, milk drying, powder sifting, and vacuuming, and is refined using scientific methods. Its composition is water 5.36%, butterfat 24.53%, carbohydrates (milk sugar) 39.77%, protein 23.90%, and mineral salts 6.44%. According to the factory manager, only two types of domestic pure milk powder, An Jian Er and Jin Shi Pi, are produced. The factory raises 200 purebred yellow cattle, and the fresh milk produced is used as the raw material for the milk powder.</p>

<h3 id="e39">Year of Career Change <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>By Gan Cao</p>
<p>The year of Ren Wu is the year of the Horse, which means Mr. Ma Lang Tang is in charge. Since the tide of unemployment rushed in like a flood last December, this year has become the year of career change. People living in Shanghai are said to have known for a long time that the Shanghai Bund was going to become the "Shanghai collapse," and they are not really reluctant to leave Shanghai. The real problem is how to maintain the livelihood of their families after losing their jobs, which cannot be delayed. If there is food to eat in their hometown, then naturally they will return home. The problem is that their hometown, which they left many years ago, has long since run out of money and resources to provide for their livelihoods. So, they have no choice but to stay in Shanghai and look for another way to make a living. To find a livelihood, they have to worship Mr. Ma Lang Tang as their master and change careers. Every job produces an expert, and there are 360 lines of work. There will always be one that you can do. That's what everyone thinks.</p>
<p>Originally, the phrase "change careers" was a complaint made by business people at the end of the year when they settled their accounts. They wouldn't really change careers. But this year, with Mr. Ma Lang Tang in charge, changing careers is not just empty talk, but an actual behavior. If you can't open a car dealership, change to selling bicycles. At least it's still the car industry, just with different vehicles. For example, the Yangzi Automobile Company on Route d'Albert has set aside half of its store space to operate a local goods business, and the Xiangsheng Car Company on Route Min Tini Yin has also changed to a local goods store. That's changing from the "car" industry to the "food" industry, which is a real career change.</p>
<p>Bosses who used to run around to outport foreign ships doing Western clothing business have switched careers, and some who used to do civil ship transportation have switched to restaurants. That's a shift from the clothing industry to the "service" and "food" industries. But even some catering businesses that used to be lunch boxes have also changed to the clothing industry, and so on. There is a bookstore owner who is said to be switching to the Southern goods business. His reason for changing careers is that there is no fear of not having business in the Southern goods industry. Sugar, peanuts, soybeans, and Chinese yam are essential purchases for most families. Even if you can't do business, all the stock on hand can be used as food to temporarily stave off hunger, so you don't have to worry about starving to death in the store.</p>
<p>Many people have changed careers successfully. For example, someone who used to work in a bank has changed to a stationery business. All kinds of stationery have actually grown bigger and bigger, like carbon paper, which has risen from more than ten yuan a box to 120 yuan, and there is still a shortage of goods. A bottle of Citibank ink, which used to cost about one yuan, has risen to about ten yuan. It's scary to even hear about it. A former senior employee of a foreign company has changed to the soap and candle business. A movie theater owner buys up foreign pharmaceuticals and hoards pigments, watching the prices rise every day. He's making money hand over fist and doing quite well.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "A scholar is useless." But scholars who have ideas still have ways. Someone who writes beautiful regular script has opened a calligraphy school. Those who used to write poetry and essays all day long have opened Chinese language tutoring classes. Those who are good at Shanghai-style English become private tutors. Young female scholars are even more resourceful, simply becoming dancers or actresses. Those who are really talented hoard cosmetics. But aside from female scholars, the career changes of scholars are always confined to the world of pen and ink. The best and most intelligent career change for a scholar is to become a fortuneteller. In this chaotic time, the more desperate people are, the more they want to try their luck. Because they want to try their luck, they want to find a cheap solution. The more they see gods and ghosts, the more they need character analysis and fortune-telling to cater to their needs. With so many people in Shanghai who want to try their luck, is there any fear of not having business as a fortuneteller? Making a fortune is what they expect. Seeing this, the author took a crash course in astrology and it has been very effective. According to the author's research, to predict the coming year of Ren Wu in one sentence, one should worship Mr. Ma Lang Tang as their master, that is, change careers, change careers. If you don't believe me, just wait and see.</p>

<p>The cash black market heated up, and Zhang Feng suddenly increased prices. The price had already soared beyond the 17,000 yuan mark, and people were excited. As a result, Japanese military notes soared to six yuan, leading to all sorts of speculation about the currency system. Moreover, since the end of last week, large investors have been buying up physical goods, and some gold shops, such as so-and-so, have temporarily stopped buying physical goods. The籌碼 [market stakes] are even more scarce. At the beginning of the morning, the price was shouted at around 16,000 yuan, but there was still more demand than supply. The first transaction price was 16,500 yuan, 1,700 yuan higher than last Saturday's closing price, and 1,100 yuan higher than the afternoon off-market price. Silver shops and silver houses came in strong, pushing the buying frenzy to 16,700 yuan. Securities firms reluctantly sold, briefly falling sharply to 16,000 yuan, and the lowest price shouted was 15,800 yuan. However, people's spirits were high, and after that, there was more chaos. Cash shops and silver shops, securities firms, and money exchange businesses all entered strongly, and retail investors competed to buy, and the price stepped up by 1,100-1,200 yuan. At 11:15 AM, it reached a high of 17,300 yuan. Northern gangs sold strongly, sharply retreating to 16,800 yuan. The buying frenzy reignited at noon, and the closing price was 17,100 yuan, 2,100-2,200 yuan higher than last Saturday, and 2,000 yuan higher than the afternoon off-market price of that day. There was a difference of 1,300 yuan on a normal day. Turnover was not strong. In the afternoon, it rose again to 17,800 yuan. Jewelry gold rose by 200 yuan per tael, to 1,800 yuan. At 5:30 PM, it rose again by 50 yuan, to 1,850 yuan. (Purchases were reduced by 200 yuan, and another opening was seen). Standard silver rose by 2 yuan to 16 yuan, and the black market price also rose to more than 14 yuan. Silver dollars were around 8 yuan and 50 cents.</p>
<p>Foreign Currency Market Conditions: British pounds and US dollars each rose by 25 yuan. The former rose to 390 yuan, and the latter rose to 400 yuan. US dollars also rose to 17 yuan and 6 jiao. Hong Kong notes rose by 1 jiao to 2 yuan and 9 jiao 5 fen. Large notes decreased by 5 fen, and military notes stepped up to 6 yuan.</p>

<p>Cotton yarn market conditions: The rising trend was quite strong, which was because the price of Japanese yarn cloth continued to soar, causing people's spirits to rise accordingly. The opening price for 20-count Shuang Ma factory singles was 2,910 yuan. Afterwards, it was heard that the price of military notes had risen, and buying interest became stronger. The market continued to increase, and even broke through the 3,000 yuan mark. A slight setback was seen, but the current price of yarn thread is quite firm, and the buying momentum is still strong. The local price once reached 3,110 yuan. When the rising trend was sharp, some profit-takers sold, and it loosened again to 2,980 yuan. By the time the market closed, it had risen back to 3,000 yuan. 42-count Blue Phoenix was 6,500 to 6,820 yuan, 60-count Bull Head was 12,000 yuan, 42-count Fairy Peach was 6,620 yuan to 6,700 yuan, 40-count Double Tiger was 5,880 yuan, 32-count Red Happiness was 5,380 yuan, 32-count Golden Pagoda was 5,000 yuan, 20-count Moon Lute was 3,500 yuan, 20-count Fairy Peach was 3,400 yuan to 700 yuan, 20-count Blue Phoenix was 3,800 yuan, 20-count Water Moon was 3,950 yuan, 20-count Swiss Horse was 3,200 yuan, 20-count Double Earth was 3,270 yuan, 20-count Double Horse was 3,550 yuan, 16/8-count Weaver Girl was 3,380 yuan, 16/8-count Big Red was 3,100 yuan, 10-count Bao Yi was 2,250 yuan, 10-count Boy Scout was 2,300 yuan, and 10-count Double Earth was 2,280 yuan.</p>

<p>Eastern Cloth Market: Yesterday's market saw a surge in Golden Thread Gauze, with merchants and fellow traders still [unclear characters]. At the same time, experienced traders occasionally sold, but only with the assurance of replenished stock. Consequently, panic spread, with a buying frenzy driving prices to an extreme. New orders for twelve-pound Dragon Head Fine Cloth opened in the morning at 151-152 yuan, rising steadily throughout the morning session to close at 166 yuan. Mid-range brands hovered around 150 yuan. The afternoon session opened at 165-166 yuan, with the peak reaching 170 yuan before profit-taking by retail investors pushed it back down to 164.50 yuan. The closing price was 23.50 yuan higher per bolt compared to the previous [unclear character]. However, spot Dragon Head and mid-range brands continued to rise, increasing by another 3-5 yuan compared to the morning. Evening closing prices were 151.50 yuan for spot Dragon Head and bank orders, 152.50 yuan for Colorful Ball Flying Fish, 52 yuan for Yang Crane, 51 yuan for Trumpet Five Blessings.

<p>Government Bond Plunge: Yesterday's market continued to decline, with Tai Kang Cheng ceasing selling and starting to buy, while Yong Kang and Tong Yi released more stock, likely due to the massive surges in gold, cotton yarn, and military notes, prompting a shift in investment. After last Saturday's close, the gray market price was firm, but yesterday it reversed and declined again, which was quite unexpected. There were plenty of buyers in the market, such as Tai Kang Cheng, Tong Kang, Lian Yi, and Jiu Feng, while Yong Kang, Tong Yi, Lian He, and Da Zhong were all sellers. Market sentiment suggests a rebound is due given the significant price drop. However, confidence is lacking due to continuous selling by major players. As a result, the market continued to fall sharply, by 6 jiao to 1.6 yuan, with approximately 400,000-500,000 yuan in transactions. Details are listed in the table below.</p>

<p>The coarse grains market is uniformly booming, driven by the surge in gold yarn and the resulting surge in sentiment. Investors are rushing to buy, especially the local shops, making the market exceptionally strong. Generally, bean prices rose by 3-5 yuan, bean cakes rose by 3-4 yuan, and red sorghum rose by 2-3 yuan.

The afternoon buying interest did not wane, reaching as high as 80 yuan. Small bags were out of stock and did not open.</p>

<p>The price surge in cigarettes has been rekindled. Due to drastic financial changes and public panic, people are scrambling to hoard goods, sparing no effort. Consequently, prices are rising across the board. British Brands are selling for 7,801 yuan per case, Old Knife brand for 6,800 yuan, Little Fairy brand for 4,700 yuan, Five Hua brand for 4,600 yuan, and Pin Hai brand for 6,300 yuan, all rising by 400-500 yuan compared to the previous day.

<p>The supply of Western dried mussels has been cut off. Recently, some goods have emerged from sealed warehouses. Western medium dried mussels are opening at 735 yuan, and large dried mussels are at 766 yuan, more than one-third higher than the price at the end of January.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Dried Lily Bulbs Costs Increase <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>After the transportation from Hong Kong was cut off, the sales of dried lily bulbs became sluggish, so the market price was often flat. However, as the prices of all goods have recently risen, the price of this item is still low. Moreover, the external costs from Su to Shanghai have recently increased, adding 60-70 yuan per piece, so the market has also turned firmer. Upper-grade is recently quoted at 170 yuan, and ordinary is at 150 yuan.</p>

<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>Jia Si Xie, in his Essential Skills for the Common People, also quoted Guang Zhi, saying: "...The fruit has horned fruitlets, six or seven inches long, with a stem of three or four inches. The fruitlets grow in rows on the stem, two by two, like embracing each other." These fruits sometimes follow each other in tiers, and each axis can weigh up to twenty-five kilograms! Can you imagine that this non-woody and fragile herbaceous plant can bear such a large and heavy batch of fruit?"</p>
<p>As for the flavor, color, and varieties of this berry, our ancestors have already discussed them in great detail. Ji Han in his Flora of the South says: "Sweet bananas... peel the skin of the fruitlets, the color is yellowish-white, the taste is like grapes, sweet and crisp, and can also relieve hunger. There are three types: the fruitlets are as large as a thumb, long and sharp, like goat horns, called 'Goat Horn Bananas', the taste is the sweetest and best. One type has fruitlets as large as goose eggs, like cow's milk, called Cow's Milk Bananas, which are slightly less than Goat Horn."</p>

<h3 id="e54">From the Fields <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Mo</p>
<p>Under the high cost of living, everyone feels it is difficult to live in Chang'an. Therefore, the unemployed only carry loads on their shoulders, traveling between Shanghai and its suburbs, carrying two dou of national rice to help feed the people of Shanghai. Those who have studied for a few years, all they can think of is "Go back, go back! My fields are overgrown, why not return?", lamenting the desolate fields and the displaced families. However, because prices are rising everywhere, if one claims to be "a commoner from the fields, plowing in Nanyang," in this year of plenty yet the wife cries from hunger, and the warm winter yet the child wails from cold, it is not easy for this commoner to leisurely plow the fields. Only the herdsboy who has just understood the meaning of things still has the elegant interest of hanging a book on the ox's horn. This is all because of the mistake of reading poetry and books, times have changed, and now when discussing the future "three visits to the thatched cottage," this unexpected encounter, of course, even if there is such a dream, one cannot reach this realm. However, looking back, one can only feel ashamed and willing to rot with the grass and trees.</p>
<p>Many people come from the fields, and even I don't need to see it as glory, nor do I need to see it as shame. Of course, I am a child from a farming family. In our childhood, we often felt that the countryside still preserves ancient customs, and we cannot help but feel that when rites are lost, we seek them in the countryside. Our elders never understood hoarding, nor did they know how to deceive. Everyone supported each other to live and stayed together until death. Later, we discovered that there are cities where one can live freely, seek profit, and even seek a way to satisfy one's desires. Who is without feelings? How can one refuse this? Therefore, they brought us, these formidable youngsters, to see the world. Farming became the work of fools, and tenant farmers took over. Coming from the fields became rushing to the foreign market. Sometimes, before the morning mist has cleared, one cannot help but wonder why we are here. However, it is only a sigh, and we never have the intention of letting our hair down and entering the mountains.</p>
<p>Over the past twenty years, I have seen a lot of the world, tasted a lot of life's flavors. For the sake of living, I have once again remembered that I came from the fields. The weeds are rampant, and the smoke is hazy. I don't know what my hometown looks like. Having left home at a young age, my local accent hasn't changed. If I return, I don't know if the children will meet me and not recognize me, and laugh and ask, "Where does the guest come from?"</p>
<p>In the midst of the return-to-the-village movement, for those who have problems with rice and coal, although we may share the sentiment of "we are all poor wanderers, why should we have met before?", we will naturally think about returning home. However, to be like Tao Yuanming, who finds pleasure in going to the garden every day, and whose door, though set up, is always closed, avoiding the dust and cutting off social interactions, and who is also happy with his destiny and has no doubts, is naturally not something that those who are ashamed of their empty pockets can do.</p>
<p>Returning to the fields, picking up the rusty farming tools again, not to mention the big talk of engaging in production, but only seeking personal warmth and food, avoiding dividing porridge to eat, then is today's thought of coming from the fields not tomorrow's return from the city?</p>

<h3 id="e55">Flower Drum Opera <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Ze Fu</p>
<p>Flower drum opera is a small opera popular in Hubei and Hunan, and is similar in nature to the Yangko dance in the north and the [unclear character] in the south. It is said that the origin of Hubei is due to the local pastoral songs, and the origin of Hunan is due to the tea-picking songs of Guangxi. Therefore, although the names are the same, the singing methods are different. In the past, Hubei used no other instruments except gongs and drums. When singing, it was like a high-pitched tune, and at the end, the people on the stage would help sing. In Hunan, in addition to gongs and drums, there is the accompaniment of the erhu. When singing, there is no chorus, just like ordinary songs. However, in recent years, Hubei's flower drum opera has also been greatly reformed, abolishing the chorus and adding the jinghu, and to distinguish it from the old flower drum opera, it has been renamed Chu Opera. In the past, the plays performed were mostly love stories, such as "Yingtai Crying at the Tomb", "Jinlian Teasing Uncle", "Twelve Longings", etc. Today, more attention is paid to ethical morality, and historical plays such as "Qu Yuan Throwing Himself into the River" and "Dong Yong Selling Himself" are also performed. However, Hunan's flower drum opera still maintains its original color, and there are no great historical figures to speak of at all. Such as "Zhang San Pan Jie", "Lanqiao Drawing Water", "Monk Begging for Alms", etc., are all nothing more than the love between men and women, as well as humorous jokes, and characters that are familiar to the public.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Woman, Dog, Man <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Changnian</p>
<p>He was a young man, the thing he feared the most was dogs, and the thing he liked the most was women.</p>
<p>He met a girlfriend, young and beautiful. One night, he and she were walking hand in hand on the street, when suddenly a ferocious hunting dog rushed towards her. At that time, he didn't know where the courage came from, and he kicked it away with one foot. From then on, he was no longer afraid of dogs, but women were still his favorite.</p>
<p>There came a day when his girlfriend became the wife of another man, so he had no choice but to spend all day playing with a newly purchased puppy.</p>
<p>What happened after that? It is said that this young man has changed his original opinion, because he has found that dogs will always faithfully follow their masters, and they will never be as clever as women.</p>
<p>Now, the thing he fears the most is women, and the thing he likes the most is dogs.</p>

<p>Elementary school teachers have to integrate with the lives of their children, and they have to pay attention to the living conditions of each child. Xue Baozhu is a good student, but recently she has been absent from the common sense class on Saturday afternoons for several weeks. Mr. Liang asked her again and again, but she always shook her head with her neat braids, and her eyes shot out a kind of "mature" light.</p>
<p>Mr. Liang couldn't figure it out, so he went to Xue's house for a visit. He was received by Mrs. Xue. She explained the reason why Xue Baozhu was absent:</p>
<p>"Mr. Liang, the store can't buy briquettes, and the briquettes at home have been burned out. In the past, Aunt Zhang would go to the briquette factory early in the morning to queue up, and occasionally she could buy half a load. Recently, it's no longer possible. When I rush there in the morning, the tickets have already been issued. I heard that people are queuing up overnight. We can't eat raw rice. I saw that Baozhu only has one class on Saturday afternoons, so I told her to eat lunch and go to queue up. The queue is already very long. She doesn't want to miss class, but I can't help it. After dinner, Aunt Zhang will replace Baozhu to go home to eat and sleep. Aunt Zhang refuses to wait overnight, saying that if she has to wait overnight, she would rather not help people. So, before the curfew, I have to replace Aunt Zhang to come back, write the number at two o'clock in the night, issue the tickets at six o'clock tomorrow morning, and then buy briquettes with the tickets. People say that briquettes may not be sold anymore, so these few weeks I had to let Baozhu miss some classes. Please, Mr. Liang, give her some extra lessons when you have time."</p>
<p>After saying goodbye, Mr. Liang walked on the road, and he couldn't help but wonder: He often walked past the queues to buy briquettes, but he never thought that one of them would be his own student. Elementary school students playing relay races on the school playground are most enthusiastic about Baozhu. I didn't expect that she was also doing a survival relay competition in the square outside the school. I hope she will also win as often as she does in school.</p>

<p>(2) Sorrow and Joy</p>
<p>The street gradually had pedestrians, and the grain stores were also opening. He looked up and saw that the sun was shining on the earth, and the bamboo leaves and tree trunks across the river seemed to be sweating. A ripple rose on the river surface, and half of it was illuminated by the sun, flashing with a pattern-like beauty. He propped the cloth umbrella on the ground, stood up and walked out of the edge of the market. Several people came towards him, one of them called out "Young Master Ye." Wei Cheng nodded and greeted him, "Are you coming to town? The road is not very dry yet, but the weather is good. It's almost the end of the year, and everyone is hoping for good weather." The man also said a few polite words and walked past. Wei Cheng had learned this set of perfunctory behavior towards the villagers. Thinking about it carefully, that person recognized himself, but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't remember his surname.</p>
<p>A place that an arrow can reach will not take much time to walk to. With a joyful heart, Wei Cheng happily ran and ran, and after a while, he saw dozens of old trees surrounding the black roof, the pink-white walls, and the forest of spears and halberds that was the fence, which was the ancestral hall of the Ye family, Shi De Tang Ye Mansion. He stepped on the ridges of the fields under his feet, and the wheat sprouts that were growing angrily in the fields were green and lovely. They received the warmth of the sun and the shock of the cold wind, as if they were about to stand up from the fields and run. Wei Cheng knew that this field was the inheritance passed down by the ancestors of the Ye family, and it was now jointly managed by his mother and aunt, and several farm workers and old women cultivated it. He became a little [unclear character] again.</p>
<p>Walking closer and closer, he reached the bamboo fence door. Several family members were standing at the doorway: two of them saw Wei Cheng and ran in; one was the farm worker Ah Xing, who came up to greet the young master. Seeing that Wei Cheng had no clothes bags or suitcases in his hands, he took the umbrella, saying, "Young master is back early. The eldest mistress and the second mistress said that the young master is coming back soon. If I had known that you were coming back today, I would have come to Huagang to pick you up." Wei Cheng walked into the bamboo fence door. In a square, a handcart was parked. Wei Cheng said, "Whose car is this?" Ah Xing walked in front, without answering. Walking through the front door and the second door, he still followed his old habits, walked into the Shuangmei Study, located west of the living room, and reverently bowed three times to the portrait of his father, Lord Aitang.

<h3 id="e61">Learning the Guqin <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Last year, I studied the guqin from Mr. Wu Jinglue of Yushan. At that time, Mr. Tang Weilao and others were encouraging him to set up a studio in the Xiao Sheng Qin Yun Room. The young and old who followed him were mostly women, totaling dozens of people. He taught all the fingering and music theory with great care. In less than half a year, they could play and sing, and the lightness, heaviness, speed, and slowness all conformed to the rhythm. When I retired to play the guqin, such as High Mountains and Flowing Water, Wild Geese Descending on the Sandbank, Fisherman's Dialogue and other pieces, I could also play them clearly and melodiously. My thoughts wander beyond the thousands of miles of lakes and mountains, and the joy is indescribable. On every spare day, Mr. would often gather his followers and have them play the pieces he taught together, in order to encourage them. Mr. and his friends also accompanied them with the se and xiao from time to time, and the sound was loud and clear, leisurely, and the joy was even more harmonious. From this, I know that our learning is progressing day by day. Alas, learning the guqin is not an easy task! Few can do it, and even fewer are proficient. If the teacher is not the right person, then they will be ignorant of the direction throughout their lives. I have followed Mr. for a long time, admiring Mr.'s learning. I am fortunate that I can get guidance, and there is leisure in my melancholy and worries. Can this not be called a joyful thing? I describe this to tell my fellow enthusiasts, and also to express my admiration.</p>
