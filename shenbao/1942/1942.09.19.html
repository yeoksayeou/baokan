<h3>復興東亞之路為九一八紀念作</h3>
<p>— 汪兆銘</p>
<p>和平運動一開始我們就有了一個堅決的信念我們深信東亞全民族必須共同協力才能夠使東亞復興東亞各民族又必須各自努力使自身成為復興東亞有力的一員然後這力的總和才顯得偉大</p>
<p>一加一等於一一百個一加起來就得一百可是一加許多零還是等於一另一方面說一百個一加起來是一百如果各自分開也祇得一個一罷了這是一個最淺近的常識我想誰也知道得很清楚的大東亞戰爭爆發以後隨著時勢的推移我們的信念愈顯得正確現代的戰爭是總力戰我們必須使用所有的力量去外取最後的勝利進一步說不只要使用現在所有的力量還要憑著現在所有的力量去創造更偉大的新的和量然後拿出新舊力量的總和去爭取最後的勝利我們怎樣才可以建設起這個力量的總和并且拿將出來使用呢話又得說回來不出兩途即各自努力和共同協力便是</p>
<p>中日和平運動一方面固然要使戰爭終止免除東亞內部力量的相抵相消但和平運動的意義不僅在這消極方面而尤在於建設中國復興東亞的積極性所以我們早就說過和平運動是革命的運動這個意義在大東亞戰爭爆發後的現在看起來是更加重要了</p>
<p>現代國家的總力戰是把人的資源和物的資源看得同樣重要的物的資源也可說是靜的資源而人的資源則是動的資源物力若果沒有人力為之推動則靜的恒靜力量無從表現出來在這一次世界大戰未發生以前一般都把英美的物力估價得太高如今呢一則戳穿了紙老虎二則戰爭改變了原來的情勢英國不用說了就是美國也顯見得漸漸不行了現在英美勢力已被驅逐出東亞領域之外東亞本來是具有龐大的人力和物力的加上在大東亞戰爭之中又增加了不少的人力和物力現在的問題只是怎樣拿這龐大的人力去推動這龐大的物力而已我們東亞民族向使能夠本著各自努力共同協力的原則加緊奮門以我們龐大的人力去推動龐大的物力建設一個嶄新的東亞那麼英美侵略主義的勢力就永不能抬頭東亞前途的光明也就如日之中天永遠照耀於大地了因此復興東亞雖然分析起來可以有許多途徑然而殊途同歸這許多途徑都趨向著一條康莊大道東亞民族的各自與共同協力</p>

<h3>蘇聯的樂園——高加索（二）</h3>
<p>各色的人種</p>
<p>高加索是素以雜居各種民族著稱的就其狹小的面積而言世界上恐怕沒有再比高加索居住著更多種類的民族的地方吧</p>
<p>高加索的居民據說總數達一千二百萬這包括俄國人韃靼人阿美尼亞人卡爾次威人戈爾齊人奧塞嘉人伊朗人鼓德爾人希臘人及猶太人</p>
<p>高加索的俄人就是居住於內高加索的古巴尼河及鐵萊克河流域的哥薩克約計三百萬人</p>
<p>俄人以外的伊朗人希臘人及猶太人等為數並不多人數最多的要推只有在高加索才能看見的戈爾齊人卡爾次威人以及奧塞嘉人了</p>
<p>戈爾齊人共計一百萬人泰半居住於高加索中央山脈的兩側面因此戈爾齊人通稱為山地居民這民族又分成種種小民族其中萊祖金人捷區那人印格西人等住在中央山脈的東部而傑爾凱斯人卡巴狄拿人卡拉卻夫人等則住在它的西部</p>
<p>戈爾齊人是中等身裁體格結實而行動敏捷的民族他們的性格頗為正直而態度溫和可是感情過敏而又富於報復心因此當帝俄企圖合併高加索的時候曾數度受戈爾齊人的阻撓高加索警備隊（泰半由哥薩克人組織而成）因不斷受戈爾齊騎兵的襲擊曾蒙受極大的犧牲他們擅長山岳地帶的騎馬術連那索以騎兵著稱於世的哥薩克人也唯有自嘆不如戈爾齊人竟像兒戲一般地對付他們的追擊戈爾齊又多美女黑眼黑髪的女子不知曾使幾多俄國軍官拜倒她們的裙下高加索的山中曾開過多少美麗的羅曼史的花朵詩人普希金及文豪托爾斯托留下許多處理這些羅曼史的有名的作品</p>
<p>風俗與習慣</p>
<p>戈爾齊人的服裝非常別緻而美麗男人部戴著羊毛皮製成的高帽子穿著衣裾極長的大衣上面繫著銀飾的細帶而在這帶上必定插著一枝短劍</p>
<p>他們的家是由石頭堆成的無煙囪的小屋屋頂平坦所以這屋頂可以借用為天井或陽臺到了夏天戈爾齊人都睡在這屋頂上戈爾齊人信奉著回教</p>
<p>卡爾次威人也分成幾個小民族這包括葛爾狄亞人伊美萊基拿人葛雷人民格萊爾人斯瓦拿人拉次人海維蘇爾人托新人及普沙夫人等他們大都居住於深山之中和戈爾齊人同樣的他們的容貌也頗為美麗宗教上他們信奉基督正教</p>
<p>阿美尼亞人散居於高加索各地可是大我數集中於阿美尼亞高原阿美尼亞人是高加索人種中最富有老頭而坡有進取心的民族高加索的工商簡直可以說全部握在阿美尼亞人手中他們信奉著將天主教及基督正教折衷的種基督教</p>
<p>韃靼人住在高加索的東南部因為這是位於高加索國境附近的亞塞爾拜然所以又稱亞塞爾拜然的韃靼</p>
<p>希臘人及土耳其人住在黑海沿岸各地而伊朗人則住在阿普雪朗半島之上</p>

<p>東京十八日同盟社電</p>
<p>據外務省本日午後宣布代理副外相山本態一氏任命為副外相以助理外相谷正之聞此項任命為谷正之氏所推薦</p>
<h3>日報評論</h3>
<p>東京十八日中央社電</p>
<p>值茲戰時外交之重要性固已不待贅言故此次日政府起用谷正之氏為專任外相仍兼情報局總裁此間各報對此均期望甚殷如朝日新聞社論稱外交戰對武力戰在補助手段之意義上實未可作過小評價故在此戰時外交之推進上谷外相之任務異常重大況仍兼任情報局總裁而負對內外宣傳之要務是以深望各新外相秉其忠誠努力邁進以樹立帝國外交之權威與信義東京日日新聞稱當此帝國聲威日張之時帝國外交之接觸方面益形擴大然僅賴外相一人之力亦難達所期之目的故尤望外務當局全體之努力活動讀賣報知稱谷新外相自去年現內閣成立即任情報局總裁於戰時內外政策上多所參劃此次參加純外交事務以其參與戰時政務之現實知識於今後外交之推進上其裨益決非淺鮮又朝日新聞社論評青木一男氏之任國務大臣稱青木氏為大藏省出身之老鍊財務官此次之入閣咸慶得人又該社論結論稱現內閣之迅速決定一大臣入閣是為其果斷之證明從而展開其戰爭指導以萬全之步伐從事於國內體制之推進此實深堪期待</p>

<h3>宵禁解除以後</h3>
<p>宵禁是繁榮的陰影夜生活的警鐘娛樂事業的暗礁有人這樣說過</p>
<p>最近公共租界工部局布告因保甲制度及自警團組織已有成效自本月十六日起取消宵禁辦法市民但需隨時攜帶市民證否則將遭巡捕盤詰或扣留同時法租界公董局也宣布一俟保甲組織完成身份證普遍發給即與公共租界採取同一辦法并且暗示時期亦已不遠大約幾星期後可以實現</p>
<p>我們試回憶一下兩租界的宵禁是戰後實施的連頭帶尾將近六年以前上海夜市直夠說上一句城開不夜店舖的燈光裝飾通放不熄京戲院午夜一時後散場舞場酒嗎起碼二時打烊通宵營業的飲食館則隨處皆是便利刺激熱鬧造成市民夜生活的愛好與活躍後來砲聲一響實行戒嚴晚上十二時以後娛樂場所一律停業路上禁止通行花團錦簇的夜市陡然形成一片凄涼</p>
<p>雖然說現在宵禁是解除了但是夜市要恢復到戰前狀態事實上一定需要柜當時間吧因為一般市民的經濟力量現在決不像戰前的活潑並且在當局編制電力的原則下娛樂場所的打烊時間以及足供城開不夜的一切物資都受了嚴限制所以這次取消宵禁或許祇是象徵繁榮的預兆罷</p>
<p>解除宵禁的消息付出一般市民都是表示滿意的因為至少在必要的時候不受宵禁的限制了但也有人顧慮入冬以後剝豬玀及小竊會重新活躍起來但自警團組織日益嚴密通夜站崗實行後其治安效果決不亞於宵禁可以斷言</p>

<h3>Commemoration of the 11th Anniversary of the Manchurian Incident by the Japanese</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>Today marks the 11th anniversary of the September 18th Manchurian Incident. At a time when the Greater East Asia War is scoring successive victories and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere has already laid a solid foundation, its significance is profound and immense. Japan is expanding commemorative events nationwide today. At 9:40 a.m. on the 18th, Li Shaogeng, the Manchurian Ambassador to Japan, visited the Yasukuni Shrine. Military bands of the Army and Navy paraded in Tokyo with melodious music. At 1:00 p.m., an overseas compatriots' speech and declaration meeting was held at the Hibiya Public Hall. At 7:00 p.m. that evening, Okumura, the Vice Director of the Information Bureau, broadcast on the Tokyo radio station, praising Manchuria and elaborating on the commemorative significance. Simultaneously, the 35 ward veterans' associations, the Greater Japan Women's Association, youth schools, and young adult groups in the entire city also separately launched commemorative ceremonies.</p>
<h3>Tojo's Speech</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>A luncheon co-sponsored by the 10th Anniversary Celebration of the Founding of Manchukuo, the Great Political People's Support Association, and the Greater Japan Asian Development Alliance was held at the Imperial Hotel at noon today. Prime Minister Tojo delivered a speech on the spot, briefly stating that the development of Manchukuo over the past decade has been rapid, its national foundation is becoming more solid, and its national destiny is flourishing. It shoulders the heavy responsibility of defending the northern borders in cooperation with our country. During this Greater East Asia War, Manchukuo is advancing towards the ideal of achieving common goals, which we deeply admire. Recalling the Manchurian Incident eleven years ago, it was a process of the development of Manchukuo. In addition to wholeheartedly wishing it great development, we also express our deep respect to all allied nations that recognize Manchukuo and extend sincere friendship. On this auspicious occasion of the 10th anniversary of the founding of our allied nation, we will join hands with our allied nations and march side by side towards the path of final victory.</p>
<h3>Okumura's Broadcast</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>Okumura Kiwao, Vice Director of the Japanese Information Bureau, delivered a commemorative broadcast at 7:30 p.m. on the 18th on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the recognition of Manchukuo. The gist of the broadcast stated that recalling the September 18th Manchurian Incident ten years ago up to today's World War, one increasingly feels that the Manchurian Incident has its historical significance for the world. Tracing back to the Meiji Restoration in Japan, it was not only a national reform but also, from a world historical perspective, the beginning of a counterattack against the aggressors of England, the United States, France, Russia, and Japan. Subsequently, Japan's national power increased day by day, and the pressure from England and the United States on Japan also intensified. The pressure reached its peak, and the Manchurian Incident occurred. Therefore, according to past history, the occurrence of the Manchurian Incident was also a prelude to the world's war of restoration and was by no means accidental. Subsequently, in the early days of the founding of Manchukuo, Japan and Manchukuo were repeatedly obstructed and oppressed by England and the United States. However, for ten years, Manchukuo has been steadily developing, recognized by more than a dozen countries, and has become an independent country in name and reality. It is also a stronghold for defending Asia. Counting from Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations in Showa 8 (1933) until the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War last winter, the three countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy formed the Axis from the Anti-Comintern Pact, which has a decisive force in the new world order. The old world of England and the United States cannot help but decline because of this. Therefore, the Manchurian Incident, on the one hand, promoted the formation of the new order forces of Japan, Germany, and Italy, and on the other hand, also promoted the decline of Anglo-American democracy and was a precursor to today's world restoration war. Furthermore, on July 7th of Showa 12 (1937), with the outbreak of the Lugouqiao Incident, Japan, in order to thoroughly resolve the incident, had no choice but to resolutely declare war on England and the United States. We, looking forward to the future of the war, must have an even greater sense of awareness. On this occasion of celebrating the 10th anniversary of the founding of Manchukuo, I would like to briefly express my feelings on the evening of the anniversary of the incident.</p>
<h3>Yokoyama's Remarks</h3>
<p>Domei News Agency reports that Yokoyama, the Director of the Press Department, solemnly stated that the war that evolved from the Manchurian Incident was launched to confront the blindness and power politics of Western powers. He also asserted that the political developments that came with the war laid the foundation for establishing a new world order. In an interview with reporters from the Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, Director Yokoyama blamed the United States and the League of Nations for oppressing Japan when the incident occurred, and Japan could not know its mistakes and correct them at that time. Mr. Yokoyama, who was in the Press Department of the Kwantung Army at that time, believed that the progress of Manchuria over the past decade was a model area for China, which was always his aspiration. To enhance friendly relations between the two countries, he advocated mutual visits between young people, especially mutual exchanges to gain goodwill and understanding.</p>
<h3>The Road to Reviving East Asia: Written for the 9/18 Anniversary</h3>
<p>— Wang Zhaoming</p>
<p>From the very beginning of the peace movement, we have had a firm belief: that all the nations of East Asia must work together to revive East Asia, and that each nation of East Asia must strive to make itself a strong member in the revival of East Asia. Only then will the sum of these forces appear great.</p>
<p>One plus one equals one, and one hundred ones added together equals one hundred. But one plus many zeros still equals one. On the other hand, one hundred ones added together equals one hundred, but if they are separated, each is only worth one. This is a very simple common sense, and I think everyone knows it very well. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, with the passage of time, our belief has become more and more correct. Modern warfare is total warfare, and we must use all our strength to win the final victory. Furthermore, we must not only use all the strength we have now, but also use the strength we have now to create a greater, newer force, and then use the sum of the old and new forces to strive for the final victory. How can we build up this sum of strength and put it to use? The answer comes back to the two paths: individual effort and joint cooperation.</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese peace movement, on the one hand, aims to end the war and eliminate the mutual offset of internal forces in East Asia. However, the significance of the peace movement lies not only in this negative aspect, but especially in the positive aspect of building China and reviving East Asia. Therefore, we have long said that the peace movement is a revolutionary movement. This meaning is even more important now after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Modern national total warfare places equal importance on human resources and material resources. Material resources can be said to be static resources, while human resources are dynamic resources. If material strength is not driven by human strength, then static strength cannot be expressed. Before this World War, people generally overestimated the material strength of Britain and the United States. Now, on the one hand, the paper tiger has been exposed, and on the other hand, the war has changed the original situation. Not to mention Britain, even the United States is visibly declining. Now, the forces of Britain and the United States have been driven out of the East Asian region. East Asia originally had huge human and material resources, and during the Greater East Asia War, it has added a lot of human and material resources. The question now is how to use this huge human power to drive this huge material power. If our East Asian nations can, based on the principles of individual effort and joint cooperation, intensify their efforts to build a brand-new East Asia with our huge human power to drive our huge material power, then the forces of Anglo-American aggression will never be able to raise their heads, and the bright future of East Asia will be like the sun at its zenith, forever shining on the earth. Therefore, although there may be many paths to revive East Asia when analyzed, these different paths all lead to the same wide road: the individual and joint cooperation of East Asian nations.</p>

<p>Official sources recently announced that an enemy unit has entered Stalingrad, and fierce street fighting has broken out and has not yet ceased.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 18th (Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>The battle for Stalingrad has lasted for twenty-five days, and fierce street fighting within the city has been ongoing for five days now. German forces entered from the south, west, and northwest, and the north has now switched to a defensive posture to respond to the defenders' fierce counterattacks. It is currently raining in the war zone of the city, but this has not had a significant impact on the war situation. The complete occupation of the city is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Rome, 18th (Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>Italian newspaper war correspondents reported today that the Soviet military authorities are using airplanes to transport reinforcements to the Stalingrad front. However, many of these airplanes are being shot down by German planes.</p>
<p>Ankara, 18th (Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>According to reports from Moscow today, the defending forces of Stalingrad have received reinforcements from Siberian troops.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 18th (Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>The Stalingrad front is still in chaotic fighting. Although the German side has transferred defending forces and the situation of the defending forces is desperate, the defending forces are resisting as strongly as ever and have launched fierce counterattacks in the northwest and other areas. Every house in the city is a fortress, and every ruin is a machine gun nest. The positions of the German and Soviet armies are sometimes only a street apart, so small daredevil teams often detour to the rear of the enemy to attack. Moscow is not optimistic about the situation in the city. The north, south, and central roads are all in a precarious situation, but it is hoped that the resistance can be delayed for a few more days. In short, the battle for the city is becoming increasingly fierce, and casualties on both sides are extremely heavy. According to a German newspaper war correspondent's report yesterday, the situation in the front-line hospitals is busy, with medical personnel performing surgery and bandaging wounds day and night without stopping, and some are collapsing from exhaustion. Such personnel deserve a glorious page in the history of this thrilling battle.</p>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>German war correspondents recently reported from the front lines on the fierce battle in Stalingrad, stating that on a certain morning, the German army began to attack, and the roar of artillery was deafening. However, the Red Army stubbornly resisted, using various methods to try to hold out for a long time. Our army also attacked with all its strength, showing courage and perseverance. Although they have been engaged in fierce fighting on the battlefield for several weeks and have not rested at night, they firmly believe that the city will eventually fall and show no fear of difficulty. It was seen that the defensive fortifications near the city were just destroyed by our army, and the enemy army immediately implemented a charge with T34-type tanks weighing twenty-four tons. Special units of our army also rushed to participate in the battle, and the enemy army was finally repelled. The airfield near the city has been bombed by our aircraft and is unusable. Our army's artillery opened fire to bombard the enemy's barracks, and the enemy's artillery on the left bank of the Volga River and in the city also bombarded our army. Before long, the enemy vehicles even attacked us with tanks. When our aircraft were dispatched, the enemy's mechanized units were finally forced to retreat. In short, the victory or defeat of this battle will be determined by the infantry's battle, and the number of reserve forces is the key. For the enemy army, they have already transferred their last forces to the battlefield. According to the captives, their ranks have been fighting continuously for several days without sleep, exhausted and tired. At noon, our army captured a town near Stalingrad, and only a few houses in the entire town remained. Looking at the city from afar, thick smoke billowed and fire lit up the sky, like a fiery hell, and the residents of the city were destined to perish with the army. At this time, our army headquarters ordered a second attack. At this time, because the enemy was exhausted, their artillery fire was not as fierce as before, so our army pursued the defeated enemy and was unusually smooth. At half past twelve in the evening, our army attacked a factory on a high ground near the city. At fifteen minutes past three the next morning, our army reached its destination. At this point, our army was only five hundred yards from the city. All kinds of houses were clearly visible. Looking up at the sky, thick smoke filled the air, and no sunlight could be seen. It was impossible to tell whether the sky was clear or cloudy, and even close to our person, there were still flickering flames.</p>

<h3>Soviet Paradise - Caucasus (2)</h3>
<p>Various races</p>
<p>The Caucasus is known for its diverse ethnic groups living together. In terms of its small area, there is probably no place in the world that is home to more types of ethnic groups than the Caucasus.</p>
<p>The population of the Caucasus is said to total 12 million, including Russians, Tatars, Armenians, Kartvelians, Gorans, Ossetians, Iranians, Kurds, Greeks, and Jews.</p>
<p>The Russians in the Caucasus are the Cossacks living in the Kuban and Terek River basins of the Inner Caucasus, numbering about three million.</p>
<p>Apart from the Russians, there are not many Iranians, Greeks, and Jews. The most numerous are the Gorans, Kartvelians, and Ossetians, who can only be seen in the Caucasus.</p>
<p>The Gorans total one million, most of whom live on both sides of the central Caucasus Mountains. Therefore, the Gorans are commonly known as mountain residents. This ethnic group is divided into various small ethnic groups, including the Lezgins, Chechens, and Ingush living in the eastern part of the central mountains, and the Circassians, Kabardins, and Karachays living in the western part.</p>
<p>The Gorans are a people of medium stature, with solid physiques and agile movements. Their character is quite upright and their attitude is gentle, but they are emotionally sensitive and vengeful. Therefore, when Imperial Russia attempted to annex the Caucasus, it was repeatedly obstructed by the Gorans. The Caucasus Guard (mostly organized by Cossacks) suffered great sacrifices due to constant attacks by Goran cavalry. They are skilled in horseback riding in mountainous areas, and even the Cossacks, who are known for their cavalry skills in the world, can only sigh in admiration. The Gorans treated their pursuit as if it were a game. The Gorans also have many beauties, and the black-eyed and black-haired women have made many Russian officers fall under their skirts. How many beautiful romances have blossomed in the mountains of the Caucasus? The poet Pushkin and the literary giant Tolstoy left many famous works dealing with these romances.</p>
<p>Customs and Habits</p>
<p>The clothing of the Gorans is very unique and beautiful. The men wear high hats made of sheepskin, long coats with long hems, and thin belts decorated with silver. On this belt, they must insert a dagger.</p>
<p>Their houses are small houses made of stones without chimneys. The roofs are flat, so the roofs can be used as patios or balconies. In the summer, the Gorans sleep on these roofs. The Gorans believe in Islam.</p>
<p>The Kartvelians are also divided into several small ethnic groups, including the Georgians, Imeretians, Gurelians, Mingrelians, Svanetians, Laz, Khevsurs, Tushins, and Pshavs. Most of them live in the deep mountains. Like the Gorans, their appearance is also quite beautiful. Religiously, they believe in Orthodox Christianity.</p>
<p>The Armenians live scattered throughout the Caucasus, but most of them are concentrated on the Armenian Plateau. The Armenians are the most wealthy and enterprising people in the Caucasus. It can be said that the industry and commerce of the Caucasus are almost entirely in the hands of the Armenians. They believe in a syncretic Christianity that combines Catholicism and Orthodox Christianity.</p>
<p>The Tatars live in the southeast of the Caucasus because it is Azerbaijan, which is located near the border of the Caucasus. Therefore, they are also called Azerbaijan's Tatars.</p>
<p>The Greeks and Turks live in various places along the Black Sea coast, while the Iranians live on the Apsheron Peninsula.</p>
<h3>Madagascar Defenders Continue Resistance, Reject British Terms</h3>
<p>Vichy, 17th (Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>The defenders of French Madagascar continue to resist firmly. The number of British troops is still greater than that of the defenders, but their advance towards the capital has slowed down. It was heard this morning that the advance units of the British army have reached the vicinity of Mahajipo City, which is still 150 miles away from the capital. The governor has decided to defend Madagascar to the end. Although the British army has a large number of troops and superior equipment, they have only advanced 120 miles in seven days.</p>

<h3>New Japanese Foreign Minister Masazumi Tani Makes Statement to the Press, Will Implement Basic Policies, Maintain Japanese-Soviet Relations, Kazuo Aoki Concurrently Appointed Minister of State</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>Cabinet Information Bureau Director Masazumi Tani, by order of the Japanese Emperor, concurrently assumed the position of Foreign Minister this morning in the Phoenix Hall, presiding over the personal appointment ceremony. At the same time, Aoki assumed the position of Minister of State. Foreign Minister Tani immediately went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 4:30 p.m. to take over his duties. As for the new Minister of State Aoki, he may be in charge of the affairs of the Greater East Asia Ministry.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>The new Foreign Minister Masazumi Tani declared to the press this afternoon that he would implement the current basic diplomatic policies and maintain diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union. Once the Greater East Asia Ministry is established, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will focus on purely diplomatic affairs. Japan will respect the sovereignty and independence of each country within the Co-Prosperity Sphere. He stated that respect for the independence of a country should not be confused with the common relationship between construction and Japan. In other words, in terms of construction, the countries of Greater East Asia are actually one.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced this afternoon that Deputy Vice Foreign Minister Taiichi Yamamoto has been appointed as Vice Foreign Minister to assist Foreign Minister Masazumi Tani. This appointment was recommended by Mr. Tani.</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspaper Commentary</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>The importance of wartime diplomacy is already self-evident. Therefore, the Japanese government's appointment of Masazumi Tani as a full-time Foreign Minister, while still serving as the Director-General of the Information Bureau, is highly anticipated by the newspapers here. For example, the Asahi Shimbun's editorial stated that the diplomatic war should not be underestimated in its significance as a supplementary means to the military war. Therefore, in promoting this wartime diplomacy, Foreign Minister Tani's mission is extremely important. Moreover, he is still concurrently the Director-General of the Information Bureau and is responsible for internal and external propaganda. Therefore, it is deeply hoped that each new Foreign Minister will move forward with loyalty and effort to establish the authority and credibility of the Empire's diplomacy. The Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun stated that at a time when the Empire's prestige is growing day by day, the contact aspects of the Empire's diplomacy are expanding. However, it is difficult to achieve the desired goals by relying solely on the Foreign Minister. Therefore, it is especially hoped that the entire Ministry of Foreign Affairs will make efforts and activities. The Yomiuri Hochi stated that the new Foreign Minister Tani has been the Director-General of the Information Bureau since the current Cabinet was established last year and has participated in internal and external policies during the war. This time, he is participating in pure diplomatic affairs. His practical knowledge of participating in wartime affairs will definitely be of great benefit to the promotion of future diplomacy. Furthermore, the Asahi Shimbun's editorial commented on Kazuo Aoki's appointment as Minister of State, stating that Mr. Aoki is a veteran financial official from the Ministry of Finance, and everyone is happy to have him in the Cabinet this time. Furthermore, the editorial concluded that the current Cabinet's quick decision to appoint a Minister is proof of its decisiveness, and it will launch its war guidance and engage in the promotion of the domestic system with full steps. This is indeed deeply anticipated.</p>

<h3>No Worries About Coal Shortages, Direct Distribution to Users, Authorities Compile Distribution, Strictly Prohibit Resale</h3>
<p>As the harsh winter approaches, citizens are deeply concerned about the shortage of coal fuel. However, according to reporter investigations, the current inventory of white coal and bituminous coal in this port is at least 700,000 tons, mostly designated by the authorities to be stacked in major warehouses in Hongkou, Pudong, Western Shanghai, and the French Concession. Without a permit issued by the authorities in advance, transportation is not allowed. This inventory, combined with the large amount of advance purchases and storage by citizens themselves for reserve, is sufficient for six months of needs. The Coal System Compilation Committee of the two concessions purchased approximately 300,000 tons of white coal blocks and briquettes from coal-producing areas a month ago, which will be transported to Shanghai by freight train from various regions of North China and Central China and fairly distributed by the current Coal Industry Trust, the Da Zhong Lian Coal Company, to the registered major coal companies. It is found that the registered coal users include approximately 1,000 large and small coal companies, coal briquette factories, and firewood and charcoal shops. The daily consumption of each household is determined by the authorities, and the monthly supply is provided accordingly. If any resale for profit is found, the registration qualification will be revoked and the supply will be cut off after investigation. According to reports, under strict control of the source of coal, there is no fear of a shortage in the short term, and the price is also restricted and cannot be raised for profit.</p>
<h3>Strict Security Yesterday on 9/18</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the 9/18 incident anniversary, and both concessions tightened security, especially the French Concession, which was even more stringent. In addition to dispatching Chinese and French detectives to check pedestrians at key passes, major roads were also closed. From 8:00 a.m. yesterday, the Dongxin Bridge Street exit, which had not been closed, was also uniformly set up with iron wire netting to implement interception. Iron wire netting frames were also installed in the middle of the road at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and the Great World, and pedestrians were divided into left and right lanes for detectives to inspect. Each iron gate bordering the Nanshi area was temporarily dispatched with several female frisking squads to conduct selective checks on male and female pedestrians suspected of being suspicious. From morning to night, both concessions passed in peace, and this special security is generally expected to be completely lifted today.</p>
<h3>Distribution of Ration Rice Changed to Once Every Ten Days</h3>

At that time, the rice shop with the registration number indicated on the coupons will sell one and a half liters of white rice and half a liter of broken rice for each coupon, with a total selling price of five yuan. At the same time, the coupon holder may also purchase one catty of flour at will, with a selling price of two yuan and three corners.</p>
<p>The French authorities announced that the validity period of each coupon for rice purchase coupons will be changed from one week to ten days starting from the 12th period. The Bureau of Public Works Information Office announced that the validity period of each coupon, starting from the No. 12 coupons for rice purchase coupons, will be changed from one week to ten days. A special announcement is hereby made in the hope that all citizens will pay attention to it.</p>

Furthermore, the Japanese authorities have also decided to liquidate the Kiangsu Bank, Kiangsi Yumin Bank Shanghai Branch, and Chekiang Local Bank Shanghai Branch, which have been under the management of the Japanese military since July of this year. The notice was circulated to each bank on the 15th, stating that the Kiangsu Bank will be liquidated by the Yokohama Specie Bank, Shanghai Branch; the Chekiang Local Bank, Shanghai Branch, will be liquidated by the same bank; and the Kiangsi Yumin Bank, Shanghai Branch, will be liquidated by the Mitsubishi Bank, Shanghai Branch.</p>

<h3>After the Lifting of the Curfew</h3>
<p>The curfew is the shadow of prosperity, the alarm bell of nightlife, the reef of entertainment industry. Some people have said this.</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Settlement announced that due to the effectiveness of the public security system and the organization of self-defense corps, the curfew will be lifted from the 16th of this month. Citizens must carry their citizen's cards at all times, otherwise they will be questioned or detained by the patrolmen. At the same time, the French Concession Board of Directors also announced that once the public security organization is completed and identity cards are widely issued, it will take the same measures as the Public Settlement, and hinted that the period is not far away and can be realized in a few weeks.</p>
<p>Let's recall that the curfew in the two concessions was implemented after the war, lasting for nearly six years in total. In the past, Shanghai's night market could truly be described as a city that never sleeps. The lights and decorations of the shops were always on. Theaters ended performances after 1:00 AM, dance halls and bars closed at least at 2:00 AM, and restaurants open all night were everywhere. Convenience, stimulation, and excitement created a love and vitality for citizens' nightlife. Later, with the sound of gunfire, martial law was implemented. Entertainment venues were all closed after 12:00 PM, and traffic was prohibited on the roads. The flourishing night market suddenly turned into a desolate scene.</p>
<p>Although the curfew has now been lifted, it will actually take a considerable amount of time for the night market to return to its pre-war state. This is because the economic strength of the general public is not as vibrant as before the war, and under the principle of electricity rationing by the authorities, the closing time of entertainment venues and all materials sufficient for a city that never sleeps are subject to strict restrictions. Therefore, this lifting of the curfew may only be a sign of prosperity.</p>
<p>The news of the lifting of the curfew has been generally welcomed by citizens, because at least they are not restricted by the curfew when necessary. However, some people are concerned that pig rustlers and petty thieves will become active again after winter. However, it can be asserted that the increasingly tight organization of the self-defense corps and the implementation of all-night sentry duty will have a security effect no less than that of the curfew.</p>
<h3>Case of Fraudulent Procurement of Money Through Fictitious Business Names Still Under Investigation, Yao Yongtao Describes the Details of Each Case</h3>
<p>Shanghai native Yao Yongtao (resident at 85 Dunxin Road), Cheng Qingquan (resident at 6, Lane 40, Saint Mary's Road), and Nanxun native Shi Bosun (resident at 3, Lane 6, Xiaoshadu Road, from a prominent Nanxun family; his father once served as the general manager of a certain bank) pooled 10,000 yuan a month ago to open the Dewei Trading Company in Room 209 of the Sassoon House on the Bund, Nanjing Road. The three of them usually acted lavishly, and the places they frequented were all the most luxurious in Shanghai, as detailed in previous reports.</p>
<h3>Fraudulent Pretext</h3>
<p>Their actions contained various meanings: Firstly, their lavish behavior was used to show that they were all wealthy people. Secondly, the fact that their office was located in Sassoon House implied that they had strong capital, because in the minds of general merchants, anyone who rented a room in Sassoon House must possess substantial assets. Based on these two reasons, various firms were willing to deliver goods without requiring cash payment. Recently, because the 10,000 yuan check paid by the company to Qiu Hanming of Hongda Trading Company in Room 301 of Cishu Building, Nanjing Road, for the purchase of 50 dozen rubber soles could not be cashed, the case was reported to the Central Police Station, and Detective Cheng Renkun arrested Yao, Cheng, and Shi. Under investigation, in addition to the Hongda case, there were five other similar cases. Many of the plaintiffs are also well-known young masters in society.</p>
<h3>Cases Committed</h3>
<p>The cases include: 1) On August 31st, purchased rubber soles worth 12,400 yuan from Ma Jiying (younger brother of Ma, the small owner of the Wu Palace Hotel), the manager of Zhongxing Trading Company, and the check paid could not be cashed. 2) On August 31st, purchased 20 cartons of cigarettes worth 900 yuan from Cheng Yihong (a famous handsome man), an employee of the British American Tobacco Company, in Room 219 of Sassoon House, and the check paid also could not be cashed. 3) On August 12th, cashed a check for 3,600 yuan at Zhongnan Trading Company, 266 Beijing Road, and the check was also returned. 4) From August 21st to 30th, took dancing girls and others to dinner at the Red Cotton Restaurant on Avenue Edward VII, totaling 671 yuan, and the check paid was also dishonored. 5) On August 7th, borrowed 5,000 yuan from Qian Dan in Room 509 of the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road, and the check given afterwards was also returned. According to the total calculation, the checks issued for the above six cases amounted to more than 30,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Defendant's Confession</h3>
<p>The company's deposit in the bank was only 20 yuan. All the notes were signed by Yao Yongtao. As for the position of the company, Cheng Qingquan was the general manager, Yao Yongtao was the manager, and Shi was only a clerk. The police filed a public prosecution on the above cases yesterday. According to Yao's confession, the payments to Qiu, Ma, Cheng, etc., were not for goods but were owed debts. The payment to the Red Cotton Restaurant was stopped because the restaurant treated guests arrogantly. Shi Bosun confessed that he was only an employee of Dewei Company and knew nothing about what Yao and others had done and had no right to advise. Therefore, he could not bear any responsibility for this case. Because the details of the case still needed to be investigated, the order was given to reschedule the hearing.</p>

<h3>Formal Public Bond Meeting; Bandit Yao Tongsheng Emits Twelve Numbers Have Been Seen In Huagu, But Public Utilities Are Still Progressing</h3>
<p>The public bond market has temporarily suspended meetings due to the handling of handover and registration procedures. There may be two or three colleagues who negotiate prices with each other that are not uniform, but in general, there is little difference. Yesterday, the situation suddenly took a flying leap, and the spring scenery was full of gardens, and the concept of a red apricot branch coming out of the wall was like a vague image. The good scenery is limited by human power. The market price is different and the transaction is limited. It is estimated that the colleagues will hold a meeting this afternoon and probably the market meeting can be announced within a few days.</p>
<p>The 13th lottery for the return of principal of the Republic of China 25th Year Unified Public Bond E was held on June 10th. The lottery drew twelve numbers: 58139246270351376439530641780827930</p>
<p>The Shanghai commercial stock market turned from firm to weak, and the final rise and fall were both slight. The industry felt that the mind was uncertain. Public utilities are progressing upwards, with Zhabei Water and Electricity rising seven and a half cents to around 37 yuan. China Electric is up half a yuan. Among the cultural stocks, only the Commercial Press closed flat. The World Book Company rose sharply, reaching a new high of 59 yuan, eventually rising by 3 yuan. Chunghwa rose by 2.5 yuan. The news that the Nanyang Tobacco Company returned a certain branch was strong, with a high price of 86.5 yuan. The Great China Match Company tended to be flat. Department stores, except for Wing On's 1 yuan increase, Sincere and China General Merchandise have both returned to a little over 2.5 yuan and 2 yuan, both around 135 yuan. Among the new pharmaceutical companies, China-France Pharmaceutical rose by 5 cents, while New Asia and Minyi fell slightly. New stocks such as Shanghai Cotton Mill rose by 5 cents to reach around 14 yuan, Anda Shirts added 7.5 cents, and Hongsheng Weaving fell slightly by half a yuan. Fuchang and others were flat. There were low buying orders, and the trading was not deserted. The stock price table is now recorded below.</p>

<h3>Price of Gold Ornaments Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the retail price of gold ornaments in the Shanghai gold shop industry, Daxin Tongxing, was still suspended at 2,350 yuan per tael (about 300 yuan less when buying in). The inter-dealer price was initially as high as 15 yuan, at 2,150 yuan, and finally increased by 10 yuan to 2,145 yuan. Transactions were increasingly sparse. The retail price of silver for ornaments was still 14 yuan per tael, and the inter-dealer price was 12.35 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign currency market continued to see the Japanese military notes decline. The inter-dealer price was around 5.5546 yuan. The retail price of silver shops and small money shops was also lower, with a selling price of 5.565 yuan and a buying price of 5.545 yuan.</p>
<h3>Soybean Oil May Be Universally Available, Balsam Flowers Are Expected</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Edible Oil Wholesale Department has already started distributing soybean oil yesterday, and it can be universally supplied to retail stores starting today. It is also heard that 1,000 dan of sesame oil will be distributed to 44 sesame oil factories at the same time. The regulated retail price is 1.245 yuan per catty in military notes, and citizens can purchase it within the limit.</p>
<p>Soybeans are scarce in stock, and actual selling households are calm because they are not easy to collect. The market shows a firm and stable trend. Yesterday, 30 packages of Chongming Sha Wan were priced at 160 yuan, and 20 packages of Tianjin red bean sub-goods were priced at 160 yuan.</p>
<p>Dried sweet potatoes are rare and still selling well. Yesterday, 14 packages of Qingdao dried sweet potatoes were priced at 140 yuan, including the sacks.</p>
<h3>Major Events in the Cigarette Industry, Buying In</h3>
<p>The cigarette market demand exceeds supply, and there is a strong rumor of profits, resulting in a strong need for general囤户. The industry is increasing its inventory, stopping spitting and buying in. The market is rising sharply. British American Tobacco is 8,350 yuan, Old Knife is 6,250 yuan, 品海 is 6,000 yuan, Fairy is 5,100 yuan, and Five China is 4,850 yuan, all of which are 100-200 yuan stronger than the previous day.

<h3>Continued Small Sales of Daily Necessities</h3>
<p>The trend of daily necessities is still weak. Matches are more active in buying and selling because investors are taking advantage of the low prices, but the prices are still flat and weak. Other items are rarely inquired about. Beauty brand is 2,300 yuan, Phoenix brand is 2,000 yuan, Golden Tripod brand is 1,900 yuan, and miscellaneous brands are 1,700 yuan. The soap market is still very small. Guben is 275 yuan, Bai Xiangmao is 235 yuan, Huang Xiangmao is 205 yuan, and Arrow Knife is 245 yuan, all down 5 yuan.

<h3>Candied Dates Are Called Higher Again</h3>
<p>Due to the shortage of new goods and scarce sources, the market price of candied dates is constantly rising. Therefore, old goods are also very scarce and gradually rising. The previous stock of over-dried goods has already been dried, but the color is relatively inferior, and the selling price is not willing to compromise. The current market price has been called up by 30-40%.</p>
<h3>Longan Is About to Be Offered New</h3>
<p>Longan is now in the season of offering new, but due to inconvenient transportation, it has not yet arrived in Shanghai. According to the information from the firm, the goods on the way have already been loaded. It is heard that the medium-sized goods of Shima may arrive first, probably this week or next, but the first disk must be cleared next week before it can be兑云.</p>
