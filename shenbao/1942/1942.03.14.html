<h3>「印度精神」輪迴的神秘性</h3>
<p>一本印度賬　，到此總算敷衍了一僩大略。可是仔細看來；印度這個國確是神秘不過。何以言之？你看最初一次侵略的爪哇地人，始終打在畜道之中，無由超生。亞利安人，雖說刁蛋，佔了印度，難道現在還能承認他們不是阿三一體？亞力山大，雖也至過印度，他的成績，僅僅是送了一份希臘文化的「人情一，還拖累着子孫做了他人的魚肉。回敎的進展，直到如今，只落得裹起阿三的頭巾來，同印度敎徒，結成生死冤家。阿富汗浪費了不少人力物力，所得僅僅是替印度增添了幾許人口。成吉思汗的遠征，豈能例外？英國雖說得了印土三分之二，但百餘年來，何曾太平一日？</p>
<p>况且印人不時的在鼓噪着獨立。上次歐戰，甘地雖是上了一個小當，這次怕不見得又吃空心湯糰；聽說有兩個大好老在其中負了責任呢。</p>
<p>如此看來，印人雖說有些不爭氣，那僅是一種物質眼光的看法。印度自有一種不可磨滅的「印度精神」。這種精神說他是宗敎信仰也可，說他是哲學思想也可，說他是一種特殊的消極力也無不可，可是自古以來，經過許多風雨，這阿三們從來不曾屈服過，只有受到他們的同化，倒是事實。白種人能逃此例麽？無庸筆者多費口舌，請翻翻史蒂文孫的「菲利沙灘」就可明瞭一切。</p>
<p>佛說「因果」，雖說拖延歲月，有些太聞茸，太萎靡，太「精神」化了；然而統治印度者終久跳不出這「因果」循環的圈子。可是話又說回頭來：世上有幾個印度？一個！然則他人不能援例以强自慰解是很明顯的！因爲「印度精神」祇是阿三專有的專利產品哩！（完）</p>

<p>棉紗市况、大上大下、但現貨情形尙屬安定也、二十支變馬廠單展開狂跳、爲三千四百元、一雲間跌到三千二百四十元、在此時迥旋時期頗久、嗣后謠　紛起、謂軍票下降、而猛落至三千元關內、爲二千九百十元收盤、四十二支藍鳳初做七千一百元、至七千零五十元、四二支毛蝶六千五百元、四二支實光六千九百四十元、二十支水月四千二百五十元、至四千一百元、二十支月琴三千九百十元、二十支雙爲現貨爲三千六百四十元、至三千五百四十元、二十支天女三千五百五十元、現貨十支實彝三千四百三十元、十支童子軍二千五百元、十四支金塔三千四百元、</p>
<h3>布疋亦辦登記　市面已見直瀉</h3>
<p>廠布昨市展開一度昂翔繼即回跌、乃因雙馬紗廠單有不利傳說、影響布市、而布疋連日上漲猛烈、實銷戶益感難以出手、需求大淡、價乃回軟、售盤以高價開盤、低價收盤、參差頗巨、地球細布一四五元至一三三元、大鵬細布一四四元至一三二元、八磅振中八六元至八三元、白貓花布一二八元至一二二元　　鷄士林布二二五元至二二○元、藍木蘭漂布一五○至一四五元、本街成交二百餘件、</p>
<p>東布展開時因軍票續騰業外囤戶吸胃仍濃、各布再創高峯、但不旋踵即趨疲落、跌勢甚猛、蓋聞存貨登祀及移動證、已事在必行、因此引起一般獲利者傾賣、龍頭細布新單開盤一百八十二元、狂升至八十八元半、午收復跌至百七十二元、下午一有六十五元、開盤升至七十元、叉降至一百六十二元、再升至一百六十七元五角收盤、較封關前每疋跌十元○五角、現貨龍頭細布更爲軟弱、僅一百四十四元五角、四君子峰嘰十至十二月廠單五元一角五分、紅單四元九角七至九月老單四元七角八分、</p>
<h3>現金漲后突瀉　軍票進七兀關</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗市、先漲後突狂跌、接述退入二萬元及一萬八千元之關內、因有種種傳說、且日軍票近來飛漲過鉅、已回入七兀內、棉紗傾瀉、更有　津幫鉅額出　、引起散沒賣風也、自晨承上日假期內漲勢、開市於混亂中高達二萬零五百元、比假前（十一日）午收高二千九百元、若比上日塲外價高一百元、現金號與銀號幫售小至二萬零三百元、協記與證券號及散戶四起收吸、常見飛升四百元、達二萬零七百元高價、及見另一證券號代津幫猛出、在利空傳說中、多方羣起傾出、價竞狂瀉一千零五十元、遜至一萬九千六百五十元、紗花幫猛進、在散多力抬中、哄八百五十元、達二）萬零五百元、奈棉紗有統制訉、致狂跌、勢復虛軟、證券號　號幫明豐生元永·祥興永及津幫狂售、多方集中出　、價遂傾瀉二千九百元、午刻退至萬七千六百元低價、某證券號與浮空抵進、終見提上三百五十元、正午以一萬七千九百五十元爲收市、比假前（十一日）午收高三百五十元、若比上日塲外價低二千四百五十元、收後升至　萬八千三百元、後一萬八千一百元、上半日有三千一百元上落、成交不吒、銀樓飾金每兩大新同行均步掛小二百元、由二千一百元、降至一千九百元、（收進减二百元）、紋銀掛二十元、黑市價已升至二十一二元、銀幣一枚十一二元云、</p>

<h3>糧食恐慌　眞是不堪回首</h3>
<p>國米暗盤益見混沌、蓋今日有被禁入界之舉、人心更爲不安、販戶與執貨者乃掀風作浪、一味扳抬、早市喊聲每石達六百元之鉅、同時亦有五百數十元之價、大概以路程達近而異、至公共租界而共價愈高、民食之恐慌、昨日可謂達於絕點、思之良苦無非爲謀食圖生存、而急急惶惶買粳米不　買糯米、買黃豆赤豆苞米紅糧、無不應接不　、人頭擁擠、赤豆亦漲至每斤二元四角、平時不過一元六七角、街中負販國米者固　、不幸以所載逾限、而遭沒收者、連市民自備米糧在內、爲數之可驚、亦劇可憐、至薄暮街頭猶多米販、價已洛到五十元以下、　市聞亦至後市立即猛瀉、皆緣米無去路、只好賤售、然已乏人顧問、遂比前日小十多元、南幫晚稻開三百四十尤、三百卅元、至三百廿元不等、而崑山北粳則爲三百九十五元、然米店均無出售、售則共價遠出其上、仍非五六十元不辦、故兩日問各糧食店獲利之厚、足抵七年之功、</p>
<h3>生意中間　倖運兒</h3>
<p>此番市面變動、做好了幾等生意、一則昔以四元左右之軍票、今賣七元左右行市、獲利不貲可想見、加以向係平行之中儲鈔、而今市上亦要升水二三成、概台前尙是人頭二三批、排門還要提早上、盈利那得不高昂、再則是食糧、不問其爲米、爲苞米、爲高粱、爲豆、爲麥、只要可以療飢、國米在兩天內從每石三百二三十元、漲到六百元、比之戰前要漲起四十倍、兩日問已漲起兩百六七十元、這種生意那裹來、皆只爲苞米存底太　當、虫蛀太可惜、只可暫且禁止、不買好米吃、累得赤豆兩元餘一斤、飛飛俏、高粱粉、亦要賣至一元八九角、攙雜糠　、猶賣一元六角、切麵兩元以上做單位、還要排班去立待、三則洋粉食油烟紙店、軍票日日漲、貨價步步高、鈔票一天多一天、那得不喜笑、連帶掀動日用品、肥皂火柴色色好、價錢抬得天樣高、昔日五六元、可買一箱老牌固本皂、而今二百二十元還有人要、最可惡棉紗投機不方便、拚命只將布來抬、比早先綢緞還要貴起三四倍、一襲布長衫、破費老洋百餘元、試問取締偷鷄鷄猶在、物價有如春風　子高、生活恰如　子翻身眞糟糕、為他人作嫁衣裳、亦是算盤打不合、</p>
<h3>油豆或有辦法　雜糧飛漲不已</h3>
<p>麩皮在雜糧飛騰之下、執貨者趁機扳抬、市價乃至扶搖直上、三鑫大包麩皮乃開價昂達一百○三四元之鉅、後市謠起囤脫、頓時瀉跌至九十五元半、小包九十六元、</p>
<p>靑島生油　有二千多桶抵　、連前共四千餘桶、合計一千三百噸、油業批發處定於三四日內配售、油荒暫或可護解決、</p>
<p>糧食業楊河淸　云、食油及黃豆來源已有相當辦法、米及苞米尙須待常局之指示、最近新組織之上海調劑民食米麥雜糧合作營業處、茲亦加入雜糧公會爲特別會員、傅能共同集中力量、解決當前困難、</p>

<h3>重申「注重衞生」</h3>
<p>— 之滄</p>
<p>衛生之道，已不是時髦的事情；然而我們承認而今而後還是要生活下去的，所以不得不講衛「生」，這正和五穀或甚至六穀相同，不可一日或缺。一班篤雅君子是懂得科學的，他們的硏究衛生之道，就先從營養講起。例如一個人在一日需要多少的維他命，ABCD都有其應盡的使命：如果不吃魚肝油便會患眼乾燥症，和佝僂病，要是不吃荳類或衛生米那是要生脚氣病的；花旗橘子而買不到便得生壞血病甚至內分泌萎縮；A字牛奶定不着同樣要神經衰弱等等，翻開衛生百科全書，竞會不謀而合，不得不拍案叫絕。</p>
<p>然而在這專門講究衛生之道的世界上，偏會發生奇樣怪狀面黃肌瘦形銷骨立的一班「反衛生家」來。這是什麽道理？難道民可使由之，不可使知之，一無起碼衛生常識嗎？非也，非也，目今的時世，要求一點略合於營養標準的豆腐，（有蛋白質鈣質）也有肉價鈿之概，何况雄容華貴的魚肝油花旗橘子A字牛奶。注意營養價値的衛生固然積極，總之缺乏維他命M，便可望而不可即，於是注重精神衛生云·老淸早要乘馬桶車未上街頭之時，就到公園裹去大笑三次，或打一通太極拳意會一番，然而據說就有點勞民傷財，越是大笑等等，便總不會便秘胃呆云。</p>
<p>那眞是悽慘得有些可笑。可是終日愁眉苦臉，精神萎頓終不是生活之道。墨子有云：「賴其力者生，不賴其力者不生，」一副軟洋洋，「加羅利」在人身上雖然可以節省一些，然而生存之力的活躍，就此消失，食少事煩，決會淘汰了結，這又何苦來。</p>
<p>從懶洋洋的躺在床上避免早餐起，一切事情莫不可以停頓，地也不掃，桌也不揩，孩子在尿堆中痛哭，老鼠就可和貓兒打架，於是滿室塵生，烏一烟瘴氣。垃圾足以療飢，　漏一何妨代茶，這種精神衛生究竟一從那裹說起？</p>
<p>孟子　：「吾善養吾浩然之氣，」如今吃飯難，吃六穀粉也不易；然而爲了我們的人生，就不得不講些衛生，，——維他命難得，　贏之徒，衛生更非講不可，這決不同於敷衍了事。生於憂患，死於安樂，到底不是欺騙之辭。如今天氣漸熱，家庭衛生和公衆衛生同樣格外注意，一有病患，乞之於醫藥，倒眞有此一勞民傷財。</p>

<p>黃石甫把水烟袋讓他的車夫接了去，笑道：「維城世兄，令堂太太的病，虛弱已極。又聽說經過西醫打針，這叫老朽沒有了把握。現在姑且擬了這張方子，你信任老朽的，就撮一帖試試，生死存亡，在此一舉了。否則，另請鄕裹高明些的醫家來，……」他說着，就拱拱手往外走。走到門口，又說：「藥是良心堂的好，別家要不得，帶個四五十塊錢去。」厲又榭和維城，直送黃石甫到大門，看他坐上車，吱吱咯咯出籬門去。</p>
<p>回到裏邊，葉二太太已是在掏錢，吩咐阿興上花港良心堂去撮藥。維城道：「聽他的話，希望像是很少的。我想西醫林先生，恐怕效大要比中醫快一些。」厲又榭道：「維城，你再也不要拿不定主意。黃石甫是出名的黃瘋子，他是世醫，他父親是老瘋子，他是小瘋子，現在小瘋子也老了。他年輕的時候，沒日沒夜讀醫書，人家請他瞧病，他坐在船裏，還是讀他的醫書；走過花港市河裏，他也不管。有一次，一家急病，上他家裏去請，他已然出診去，後來他的船經過花港市河回家，請醫生的人知道時在午夜子正，這黃瘋子一定不會肯上岸來瞧病，他就擔了兩桶糞，放在橋上，說：黃先生，你不上來瞧病，我就把糞倒下來。黃瘋子沒法，上岸開了一張方子，只三十五個小錢的藥錢，病就好了，那裏要四五十塊錢。現在，眞是今非昔比了。」（二二）</p>

<p>North Xia Hua, 13th (Havas News Agency) – It is reported that British troops clashed with rebels in Kohat, Northwest India, today, resulting in five soldiers dead and fourteen wounded.</p>
<p>North Xia Hua, 13th (Reuters) – Joint government forces, assisted by reconnaissance teams and border police, have been conducting small-scale operations in the Kohat district (northwestern frontier). Approximately sixty rebels resisted the British forces from strongholds for several hours. The result was that eight to eleven rebels were killed and several wounded, while eight British soldiers were killed and fourteen wounded.</p>
<p>London, 13th (Havas News Agency) – It has been learned that several workers clashed with police near Madras, India, resulting in five deaths and twenty-one injuries. The authorities have taken measures to suppress the unrest.</p>
<h3>Rumors of US Convoy Sailing to Australia for Reinforcements; Australian Prime Minister Sends Letter to Roosevelt; Port Moresby Continues to Be Attacked</h3>
<p>Washington, 12th – There are rumors that a large U.S. convoy is transporting troops to reinforce Australia, but military authorities along the Pacific coast are remaining completely silent. However, it is generally believed that this is a necessary move in the grand strategy of the Allied nations. Judging from recent developments, the situation in the Pacific has become extremely urgent since the fall of Java and the crisis in Australia. Residents of the U.S. Pacific coast, due to their geographical proximity to Australia and their close ties, are hoping that U.S. Flying Fortresses will quickly fly to Australia to assist the Australians in their fight.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Domei News Agency) – The General Headquarters announced at 3:34 PM today that Japanese naval air groups launched a major attack on Port Moresby, New Guinea, on the 10th of this month. Sixteen enemy aircraft were hit and caught fire, and many important military installations were destroyed. In addition, several Japanese destroyers sank a British minesweeper while searching for enemy ships in the Java Sea on the 5th of this month.</p>
<p>Washington, 12th (Havas News Agency) – The Australian Federal Minister to the United States, Casey, presented President Roosevelt with a letter from the Australian Prime Minister Curtin today but refused to disclose the contents of the letter.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – Well-informed sources in Washington believe that the Australian Prime Minister's letter concerns a new plan for the defense of Australia and New Zealand, which is being submitted to Roosevelt for approval.</p>
<p>Sydney, 10th (Reuters) – The Sydney Morning Herald correspondent in Port Moresby reports that Japan may soon launch a large-scale air offensive against Australian bases in New Guinea, or even the Australian continent. Australian aircraft are currently bombing certain bases with great courage, sometimes diving to altitudes as low as a thousand feet. Currently, Japanese forces have only made limited progress in some areas. After the Australian forces withdrew from Lae and Salamaua, as well as other areas on the north coast of New Guinea, their guerrilla units remain active behind enemy lines. Japanese forces are now dispersing their troops to avoid being targeted by Australian aircraft. It will be extremely difficult for the Japanese to advance north or southeast via the Owen Stanley Range.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces in Sumatra Occupy Medan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Domei News Agency) – After successfully landing on Thursday morning, Japanese forces are rapidly taking control of northern Sumatra.

According to Japanese sources from a certain base, after the landing, Japanese forces are advancing rapidly in northern Sumatra. The first wave of Japanese forces landed in northern Sumatra at 3:35 AM on Thursday, with their main force occupying Aceh, a key point in the northwestern tip of the island. Another unit of these forces occupied an airfield west of Aceh City at 2:10 PM on the same day. Another unit landed on We Island, off the northern tip of Sumatra, at 2:36 PM on Thursday, occupying Sabang Port. A third wave of Japanese forces occupied Idi, 200 kilometers northwest of Medan, at 5:40 AM on Thursday.</p>
<h3>Governor-General of Korea Visits Tojo</h3>

<h3>Song Ziwen Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Washington, 12th (Reuters) – Song Ziwen told reporters today that supplies for China have begun to be transported via a new route. The development of this new route is like the Burma Road, and its transport capacity will exceed that of the Burma Road within a few months. When asked if China was receiving sufficient assistance, Song replied that there was never a time when there was enough during wartime. Transportation is the main problem. The United States is eager to ship more materials to China than China is currently receiving. Song believes that the future solution to the India problem is crucial for China, as it is for the United States, because we are interconnected. Song's remarks were made after his meeting with President Roosevelt. Song declined to comment on the details of his meeting with the President, saying only that today's meeting was one of his personal visits to discuss the general situation with the President.</p>
<h3>Sino-British Cultural Association Hosts Banquet for British Ambassador</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 13th – The Sino-British Cultural Association hosted a luncheon for British Ambassador Sir Horace James Seymour on the 13th. Over a hundred people attended, including Wang Shijie, Hang Liwu, Eggleston, Chiang Tingfu, Zhang Daofan, Liu Jiwen, Guo Taiqi, and Chuan Bingchang. Minister Wang delivered a speech, stating that the work of cultural exchange is also the work of diplomats, and that promoting Sino-British cultural relations is not difficult. The work of the Sino-British Cultural Association has progressed from a purely cultural nature to a political one since the outbreak of the war. Both China and Britain have made contributions to human culture. We hope that during Ambassador Seymour's tenure in China, we can fulfill our duty to maintain past contributions and accomplish the greatest mission. The British Ambassador then gave a reply.</p>
<h3>War News from Various Fronts</h3>

Chinese forces fought back until around 3:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Minister Cripps Visits India with a Major Mission; Expected to Stay for Six Weeks</h3>
<p>London, 13th (Reuters) – A Reuters political correspondent reports that Sir Stafford Cripps, carrying British Cabinet proposals for resolving the Indian political situation, is expected to arrive in India soon to fulfill his extremely important mission. Among his team of associates are Canadian economist Mr. Spry and political economy planning expert Mr. Owen. Key officials from the British India Office do not need to go to India, as Indian government officials have sufficient economic expertise. The route of Mr. Cripps' trip to India will be kept secret and will only be revealed after his safe return to Britain. It is expected that Mr. Cripps' trip will last at least six weeks, but the length of his stay will depend on the progress of his discussions with Indian leaders.</p>
<p>New York, 12th (Reuters) – India's first representative to the United States, Bajpai, told reporters that Prime Minister Churchill's statement in the House of Commons was very gratifying, and that the appointment of Cripps as a special envoy was especially commendable, as Cripps is one of the most sympathetic figures in British politics towards India. Mr. Jute, Chairman of the Federation of Indian Associations in the United States, said that Churchill's decision to send Cripps to resolve the Indian problem was very welcome. Cripps has a broad vision, is an old friend of Nehru, understands the views of nationalists, and is familiar with Mr. Jinnah, the leader of the National Congress, and understands his attitude. It is expected that Cripps, in cooperation with the Governor-General of India, will complete his mission.</p>
<p>Cripps' Mission is Arduous</p>
<p>New York, 13th (Havas News Agency) – The New York Sun commented this morning on the visit of British Lord Privy Seal Sir Stafford Cripps to India, stating that resolving the Indian problem to encourage India to fully assist the Allied nations is a matter of utmost urgency. Sir Stafford Cripps' trip may be a major factor in the victory of the Allied nations, but his mission is undoubtedly difficult and arduous. Giving complete freedom to the leaders of the Indian Congress may inevitably lead to riots and disturbances by Muslims, creating a state of anarchy. This is obvious even to the unintelligent. On this basis, Prime Minister Churchill must proceed cautiously and have obtained the agreement of Sir Stafford Cripps. In short, a solution that is likely to cause internal unrest in India is not worth emulating.</p>
<p>Japanese Army's Attack on India Must Wait Until the Rainy Season</p>
<p>Swiss Capital, 13th (Havas News Agency) – According to a special dispatch from the Swiss Daily News in London, London is very optimistic about the visit of Lord Privy Seal Sir Stafford Cripps to India and regards it as equally important as General Wavell's reappointment as Commander-in-Chief in India. It is said that Sir Stafford Cripps' plan is very broad, and the British government is willing to do anything related to the welfare of India and the welfare of its internal religions and races. However, military measures will not be relaxed due to political negotiations. The British military believes that if the Japanese army attacks India, the time will be before the summer rainy season, which will arrive in six or seven weeks. The target of the Japanese army's attack is unlikely to be the conquest of India, but rather to occupy key ports such as Calcutta, Madras, Ceylon, and Bombay to isolate India.</p>
<p>Mahatma Gandhi Expresses His Views</p>
<p>Swiss City, 12th (Havas News Agency) – According to news from New York, Mahatma Gandhi declared today in Wardha, India, that there are no signs of a resolution to the Indian problem. When asked how the British government should resolve this problem as soon as possible, Gandhi replied, "Your question is extremely subtle. I have various private opinions about British affairs. Although I have feelings for Britain, I still believe that British imperialism is a great crime against India. It would be best for Britain to recognize its mistakes and compensate for them accordingly. Unfortunately, I have not seen any signs of this."</p>
<p>American Delegation Departs for India</p>
<p>New York, 12th (Reuters) – Sir Austan, Chairman of the Indian Government Purchasing Commission, departed from here for India today with the American wartime production delegation.</p>
<h3>Syrian Defense Minister Dies Suddenly</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – It was reported here last night that Syrian Defense Minister Attrash has suddenly passed away.</p>
<h3>German Submarines Active in the Caribbean Sea; Saint Lucia Island Bombarded; Three British and American Ships Hit by Torpedoes</h3>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – The good news of a German submarine in Saint Lucia has been announced in the German military report. According to reports, the breakwater at Castries port was originally for protection, but a German submarine finally broke into its inner harbor. Two large ships anchored in front of the port were hit by torpedoes. One sank immediately, and the other capsized. Then, a loud explosion occurred, and the ammunition in the ship must have been destroyed. The water depth there is only thirty feet, so the sunken ship is still exposed above the water. The submarine also sank another ship carrying ammunition outside the port. German submarines have now expanded their scope of activities in Newfoundland, Halifax, New York, Delaware, the Florida Straits, the Caribbean Sea, and British Guiana. So far, they have sunk seventeen enemy ships. In addition to sinking merchant ships, German submarines have been quite effective in attacking enemy escort ships. In Canadian territorial waters, one patrol boat and one submarine destroyer have been sunk. Since German submarines have been operating off the coast of the United States, they have sunk a total of fifty oil tankers, approximately 385,000 tons. From January 24, 1942, to date, they have sunk a total of one hundred and fifteen merchant ships, approximately 772,000 tons, in American territorial waters.</p>
<h3>An Ominous Black Cat</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – According to the London "Evening Standard," a black cat named Oscar has brought bad luck to several warships. The British Navy authorities have now decided to send the cat to live with a sailor's family in Northern Ireland to live out its life. Initially, Oscar was raised on the German battleship "Bismarck." When the ship sank, he was rescued by British sailors and raised on the British destroyer "Cossack." However, the ship was soon sunk as well. The cat was rescued again and moved to the British aircraft carrier "Ark Royal." Unexpectedly, the ship also sank. After the cat was rescued by an unknown warship, the naval authorities immediately ordered it to be sent to Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>Washington, 13th (Reuters) – The U.S. Navy Department announced that a U.S. medium-sized oil tanker has been hit by a torpedo in the Caribbean Sea. The name of the ship was not disclosed.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – Two cargo ships sank in the Caribbean Sea a few days ago. The crew was completely rescued, including forty-nine people from a British oil tanker and the remaining thirty-four from a Swedish ship.</p>
<h3>New York Celebrates; Chinese, Indian, and Japanese People Hold Public Meeting</h3>
<p>New York, 13th (Reuters) – A public meeting was held here to celebrate "China, India, and Japan." Many people from China, India, and the United States attended. Republican leader Willkie presided, and Chinese Ambassador Hu Shi, famous writer Lin Yutang, and Pearl S. Buck also attended the meeting and gave speeches. The speeches were broadcast by radio to China and India.</p>
<h3>Hu Shi Delivers Speech in the United States</h3>
<p>New York, 12th (Special Dispatch) – Ambassador Hu Shi delivered a speech at a banquet at the Canadian Club today. Some commentators said that China's internal unity is a new achievement, but this is a complete misunderstanding. For 2,100 years, China has always had only one government, one legal system, and one civil service system. The Chinese people have always been accustomed to unity, so whenever the country is in danger, the Chinese people can overcome all difficulties. There are four reasons for China's success: first, internal solidarity; second, the ability to work hard; third, the assistance of friendly nations; and the most important factor is the perseverance and virtue of the Chinese people, who believe that justice will prevail, and therefore work together with perseverance. The West Tan Chamber of Commerce in New Jersey held a grand banquet to entertain Ambassador Hu. The Ambassador gave a speech, encouraging the Allied nations to learn from China's virtue of patience.</p>
<h3>Excellent Results in Guizhou Land Tax Collection</h3>

<h3>Brazilian President Orders Confiscation of Axis Property; Restrictions on the Activities of Overseas Chinese; Berlin to Issue Statement</h3>
<p>Brazilian Capital, 12th (Havas) – President Vargas today ordered the confiscation of some of the property of the Axis countries on the grounds that: These countries have engaged in acts of war against the American continent; Germany refuses to compensate for the losses suffered by Brazilian merchant ships; and Brazilian merchant ships were unarmed and were sunk while engaged in peaceful commerce. It is reported that the confiscated property will be deposited in Brazilian banks as a guarantee for Axis governments to compensate for Brazilian property. In addition, overseas Chinese from Axis countries may not transfer their assets to neutral countries, but this does not apply to those who continue to engage in ordinary business, although they must continue to pay profit taxes in accordance with the original tax rules.</p>
<p>Argentine Capital, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – A telegram from the Brazilian capital states that Brazilian President Vargas issued a decree yesterday confiscating the property and funds of overseas Chinese and companies from Germany, Italy, and Japan in retaliation for the sinking of Brazilian cargo ships. The confiscation methods are as follows: 10% will be confiscated for assets of 20 contos or more (1 conto is worth 50 US dollars); 20% will be confiscated for 100 contos or more; and 30% will be confiscated for more than 100 contos.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – According to news last night, the Brazilian authorities have greatly restricted the activities of overseas Chinese and diplomatic personnel from Axis countries. The identity cards of Japanese overseas Chinese in Paulo City have been revoked, preventing Japanese people from moving freely. Many people who speak German and Italian have also been arrested.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry said yesterday that the enemy is deliberately spreading rumors about German-Brazilian relations and that we will issue a statement soon.</p>
<h3>1942 is the Year of British Military Production; Powers of the New Minister of Production Expanded</h3>
<p>London, 13th (Reuters) – The appointment of Minister of State Lyttelton as Minister of Military Production was welcomed by the House of Commons, which said that this appointment was necessary given that this year is the year of military production. The powers of Lyttelton's new position will be greatly expanded, and his position with respect to various military needs will be similar to that of Churchill's position as Minister of Defense with respect to the three services of the Navy, Army, and Air Force. He will decide which imported goods are necessary and which ordinary industries must reduce their output.</p>
<p>London, 12th (Havas News Agency) – Prime Minister Churchill recently delivered a speech in the House of Commons, stating that the government has now appointed the former British High Commissioner to the Middle East, Lyttelton, as Minister of Production. His main task is to supervise military production on behalf of the War Cabinet. The Minister should also: Guide the British members of the Anglo-American Joint Committee so that resources can be used to the greatest extent possible for the manufacture of armaments; Confer with the governments of various autonomous territories and colonies to implement general production plans to manufacture various necessary materials, machines, tools, and armaments; Be responsible for implementing import procedures and armament allocation matters. In addition, the Minister of Production should cooperate with the Minister of Labor to solve labor problems. As for the Navy Department, it will continue to manage the construction and armament of all warships, and draft naval fleet procedures. The decisions made by the Navy Department only need to be submitted to the Minister of Defense and the War Cabinet for approval. In addition, the Navy Department must be responsible for building merchant ships, arming merchant ships, and repairing merchant ships.</p>
<h3>The Mystery of the "Indian Spirit" and Reincarnation</h3>
<p>An Indian account, which is now roughly summarized. However, looking closely, India is indeed a very mysterious country. Why? Look at the Javanese who invaded in the first time; they were always stuck in the realm of animals, with no way to be reborn. The Aryans, although troublesome, occupied India; can we still admit that they are not part of the Indian identity now? Alexander, although he also went to India, his achievement was only sending a "gift" of Greek culture, and he even burdened his descendants to become the meat of others. The progress of Islam has only resulted in wrapping the turbans of the Indians, forming deadly enemies with the Hindus. Afghanistan wasted a lot of manpower and resources, and only added some population to India. Could Genghis Khan's expedition be an exception? Although Britain has obtained two-thirds of Indian territory, how has it ever had a peaceful day in the past hundred years?</p>
<p>Moreover, the Indians are constantly clamoring for independence. In the last European war, Gandhi was fooled a little, but this time, I am afraid he will not eat empty tangyuan again; I heard that two great old men are responsible for it.</p>
<p>From this point of view, although the Indians are somewhat unambitious, it is only a material perspective. India has an indelible "Indian spirit". This spirit can be said to be religious belief, philosophical thought, or a special negative force, but since ancient times, through many storms, these Indians have never succumbed. Only to be assimilated by them is the fact. Can white people escape this example? The author does not need to waste words, please turn to Stevenson's "Beach of Falesá" to understand everything.</p>
<p>Buddha said "karma", although it delays the years, it is too soft, too decadent, and too "spiritual"; however, those who rule India will eventually not jump out of this circle of "karma" cycle. But then again: how many Indias are there in the world? One! Then it is clear that others cannot invoke the precedent to comfort themselves! Because the "Indian Spirit" is only a proprietary patented product of the Indians! (End)</p>

<h3>Deputy Consul General Hailin Arrives in Shanghai; Soviet Consulate General Opens; Mr. Hailin Arrives in Shanghai from Japan</h3>
<p>The English-language "Great American Evening Post" states that it has been learned that Mr. Hailin, the acting Soviet Consul General in Shanghai, arrived in Shanghai from Japan on Wednesday, and that the Soviet Consulate on Huangpu Road is now open for business. Mr. Hailin is currently also the Second Secretary of the Soviet Embassy in Japan. The Soviet Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Chai Leff, is still in Tokyo. According to reports, the Soviet Consulate on Huangpu Road in this city was closed in 1939, and all personnel were transferred elsewhere. Subsequently, the Soviet citizens and interests in this city were entrusted to the Norwegian Consul in Shanghai for management. In July 1941, they were reassigned to the Soviet Embassy in Japan for concurrent management. The officials of the consulate in Shanghai were also concurrently held by officials of the Embassy in Japan, while the consulate on Huangpu Road remained closed. It only opened for business when the Embassy in Japan sent personnel to Shanghai. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the Soviet Embassy in Japan sent Chai Zefu, the Consul General stationed in Shanghai, to Shanghai in mid-January of this year to handle consulate affairs. The quiet arrival of acting Consul Hailin in Shanghai this time is believed to be for the same purpose.</p>
<h3>Rice Shops Still Selling Foreign Rice Today</h3>
<p>Half of the rice shops in the two concessions are still selling foreign rice today. Corn will be sold again next Friday, and foreign rice will still be sold as usual on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays of next week.</p>
<p>The authorities of the two concessions have prohibited the transport of domestic rice into the concessions starting today. In addition to issuing notices, it is hoped that readers will pass on the message to avoid farmers, who may be illiterate, inadvertently carrying rice into the concessions and suffering confiscation losses.</p>
<h3>Stealing Stacked Goods and Killing the Watchman: Two Arrested</h3>
<p>The Xianglan Electrical Material Company at 661 North Sichuan Road, established by the Japanese Kishikawa, had its warehouse at 1-5 Huaxingfang, Changchun Road, Zhabei. The warehouse had frequent thefts. Therefore, in January of this year, they</p>
<p>Hired an Indian Watchman</p>
<p>They hired an Indian named Hara Ting, 36 years old, as a watchman to guard the premises. On the night of February 22nd, around 7 p.m., Zhu Jinshan from Changzhou, Yu Zheng from Jiangbei, and A Ting, all former workers of the company, suddenly came to the warehouse with concealed weapons, intending to steal. Hara Ting discovered them and grabbed Zhu Jinshan. Zhu immediately brandished a sharp blade and threatened him. While struggling with Mr. Ha, A Ting also took out a sharp knife,</p>
<p>Stabbing Him to Death</p>
<p>Stabbing Mr. Ha in the mouth, causing a deep wound, with the knife tip protruding from the back of his neck. He fell into a pool of blood, barely breathing, unable to shout. Thinking he was not dead, they dragged Mr. Ha to Room 5, placed him face down on the ground, covered him with reed mats, and pressed five bundles of heavy goods on top of him, causing him to die shortly after. The group then stole 48 dozen white porcelain light bulb shells, worth over a thousand yuan, and fled with the loot. The watchman had a Chinese woman named Zhang A Yu, who lived with the deceased at 240 Jiaxing Road. That evening, when Zhang brought dinner to the warehouse, she knocked on the door for a long time, but no one answered.</p>
<p>Discovery of the Body</p>
<p>She rushed to the office to report. Together with the foreman, she fetched the key and went to open the door. After searching everywhere for Mr. Ha without success, she reported to the Disweilu Police Station, which ordered detectives to investigate. They discovered Mr. Ha's body, with the murder weapon still inserted in his mouth. The Swiss Consulate examined the body and arranged for its burial. The day before yesterday afternoon, Li Wenbin, a Chinese detective inspector, and Ma Zhiyin, a detective, from the Disweilu Police Station, arrested the suspects Zhu Jinshan and Yu Zheng. They also recovered the original stolen goods at the Hengtai and Yuelai Hardware Stores on Tiantong Road and Disweilu and brought them to the police station. Zhu and Yu both confessed to going together, but claimed that A Ting was the one who stabbed the Indian to death, and they only assisted from the side. They were ordered to be detained for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Trolleybus Left Doors Open, Crushing a Passenger's Left Foot</h3>
<p>Yesterday evening at 8:15, trolleybus number 299, a 14th route trolleybus owned by a British merchant, driven by driver number 226, was traveling south to north and stopped at the Fujian Road and Fuzhou Road stop. After passengers finished boarding and alighting, the ticket seller rang the bell to start the bus, but the driver did not close the iron gate. He drove to the middle of the road when a man about thirty years old saw the iron gate was open and took the opportunity to jump onto the bus. He accidentally lost his footing and fell off the bus, rolling under the wheels. His left foot was crushed by the wheel, and he bled profusely, suffering severe injuries. Passersby called for an ambulance, which transported the injured man to the hospital for treatment. Recently, public transportation vehicles have been crowded, and leaving the doors open easily causes accidents. Both ticket sellers and passengers should pay attention.</p>

<h3>Refugee Relief: Giving Funds to Leave, Striving to Achieve the Goal of Sending Everyone Away; Still 9,291 People Remaining</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, recently recognizing the difficulty in procuring food and the sharp decrease in donations from various sources, making it impossible to continue, convened various relief organizations to discuss jointly. It was resolved to disperse the refugees from various camps on a fixed schedule. However, the total number of refugees, excluding those who have left, still reaches 9,291. It was originally scheduled to disperse everyone on March 15th. If the number of people is too large, the procedures may not be completed in time, so the date may have to be slightly delayed to achieve the goal of sending everyone away. It is heard that the association's expenses for this repatriation are quite high, with each adult receiving 50 national currency and each child receiving 38 yuan. The association has a small number of staff and is also willing to see the matter through to the end, dissolving at the same time.</p>

In addition, the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association announced that the association does not handle ticket sales.</p>

<h3>Arrested Gang Leader in Qianjiatang: Guns and Ammunition Found in the Eaves; Firearms Seized from Chinese Police; Several Accomplices Arrested</h3>
<p>At around 7 a.m. yesterday morning, French Police Detectives Xu Kaixing and Yang Daoqing received information that a gang leader with a long history of crimes in the concession was hiding at 67 Guangfusi Street, Qianjiatang. The detectives rushed to the address.</p>

<p>Two Thieves in Western Suits and Leather Shoes</p>
<p>The young, daring thieves Ye Shuren and Ye Baiqing, dressed in Western suits and leather shoes, looked like gentlemen from wealthy families. Last month, they recruited two accomplices and, armed with guns, robbed Liu Fangwen's house at 4 Tongyi Lane, Route Pichon, of twenty or thirty pieces of valuable gold, silver, jadeite rings, diamonds, etc., worth a great deal of money. Due to poor secrecy, the Robbery Squad detectives of the French Police learned of the crime and arrested the two Yes on the spot. The other two thieves escaped with a portion of the stolen goods. They were prosecuted and Yesterday, Ye Shuren was sentenced to five years and six months of imprisonment for robbery with three or more accomplices.

<h3>Rumors Abound, Double Horse Plummets, Current Yarn Still Stable</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is experiencing large ups and downs, but the current market conditions are still stable. 20-count Bian Ma Factory single yarn initially jumped to 3,400 yuan. One Yun Jian dropped to 3,240 yuan. It was a period of fluctuation for quite some time. Later, rumors arose, saying that military notes were declining, and it plummeted to the 3,000 yuan level, closing at 2,910 yuan. 42-count Lanfeng was initially priced at 7,100 yuan, then 7,050 yuan. 42-count Mao Die was 6,500 yuan, 42-count Shiguang was 6,940 yuan. 20-count Shuiyue was 4,250 yuan, then 4,100 yuan. 20-count Yueqin was 3,910 yuan. 20-count Shuang Wei spot goods were 3,640 yuan, then 3,540 yuan. 20-count Tiannv was 3,550 yuan. Spot 10-count Shiyi was 3,430 yuan, 10-count Tongzigun was 2,500 yuan, 14-count Jinta was 3,400 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cloth Registration Also Being Handled, Market Already Seeing a Sharp Decline</h3>
<p>The factory cloth market opened yesterday with some upward momentum, but then fell back, due to unfavorable rumors about the Shuang Ma Yarn Factory, which affected the cloth market. The sharp rise in cloth prices in recent days has made it difficult for sales outlets to sell, and demand is very weak, so prices have softened. Selling prices opened high and closed low, with significant differences. Earth Brand sheeting was 145 yuan to 133 yuan, Da Peng sheeting was 144 yuan to 132 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong was 86 yuan to 83 yuan, White Cat floral cloth was 128 yuan to 122 yuan. Kishi Lin cloth was 225 yuan to 220 yuan, and Blue Magnolia bleached cloth was 150 to 145 yuan. Approximately 200 pieces were traded on this street.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth initially opened higher due to the continued rise in military notes and the continued strong demand from off-market hoarders, with prices for all cloths reaching new highs. However, the market quickly became weak and declined sharply. It is heard that registration of inventory and movement permits is imminent, which has prompted general profit-takers to sell. Longtou sheeting opened at 182 yuan for new orders, rose sharply to 188 and a half yuan, and then fell back to 172 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, it was 165 yuan when it opened, rose to 170 yuan, and then fell to 162 yuan, before rising again to 167 yuan and five jiao at the close, a decrease of 10 yuan and 5 jiao per piece compared to before the border closure. Spot Longtou sheeting was even weaker, at only 144 yuan and five jiao. Sijunzi Fengji Factory orders for October to December were 5 yuan, 1 jiao, and 5 fen. Red orders for July to September were 4 yuan and 9 jiao. Old orders were 4 yuan and 7 jiao.</p>
<h3>Cash Plummets After Rising Sharply, Military Notes Enter 7-Plus Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash dark market, after rising first, suddenly plummeted, successively retreating to within the 20,000 yuan and 18,000 yuan levels. This was due to various rumors, and the military notes, which had recently risen too much, had returned to within the 7-plus yuan level. The collapse of cotton yarn and the massive dumping by Tianjin gangs have triggered a selling frenzy. The market opened in chaos as high as 20,500 yuan, up 2,900 yuan from the noon close before the holiday (the 11th), and 100 yuan higher than the off-market price on the previous day. Cash houses and silver houses sold down to 20,300 yuan, while Xieji, securities houses, and retail investors absorbed the sell-off, sending the price soaring by 400 yuan to a high of 20,700 yuan. Seeing another securities house dumping on behalf of Tianjin gangs, and amid negative rumors, many parties began to dump their holdings, causing the price to plummet by 1,050 yuan to 19,650 yuan. The yarn and flower gangs advanced sharply, and with retailers actively supporting the market, the price rose by 850 yuan to 25,000 yuan. However, the control of cotton yarn led to a sharp decline, and the market became weak again. Securities houses, flower shops, Ming Feng, Sheng Yuan Yong, Xiang Xing Yong, and Tianjin gangs sold wildly, with many parties concentrating their sales, causing the price to plummet by 2,900 yuan. At noon, it retreated to a low of 17,600 yuan. A certain securities house advanced with floating positions and ultimately saw a rise of 350 yuan, closing at noon at 17,950 yuan, up 350 yuan from the noon close before the holiday (the 11th), and 2,450 yuan lower than the off-market price on the previous day. After the close, it rose to 18,300 yuan, then 18,100 yuan. There was a fluctuation of 3,100 yuan in the first half of the day, with little trading volume. Gold ornaments in silver shops and peer shops fell by 200 yuan per tael, from 2,100 yuan to 1,900 yuan (the purchase price was reduced by 200 yuan). Silver was listed at 20 yuan, and the black market price had risen to 21.2 yuan. Silver coins were 11.2 yuan each.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market, after rising, retreated slightly. Both British pounds and U.S. dollars were 410 yuan. U.S. dollar notes rose to 21 yuan and finally settled at 20 yuan. Hong Kong notes rose to 3 yuan and 5 fen, with larger notes down 5 fen. Military notes rose as high as 7 yuan and 5 jiao, and finally settled at 6 yuan and 8 jiao.</p>
<h3>Food Panic Is Truly Unbearable</h3>
<p>The black market for national rice is becoming increasingly chaotic. There is a move to prohibit entry into the concession today, which has made people even more uneasy. Vendors and those holding goods are stirring up trouble, raising prices at will. Early in the market, calls reached as high as 600 yuan per stone, while there were also prices of 500 yuan and several tens of yuan, varying depending on the distance. Prices are higher in the Public Concession. The panic over people's livelihood reached its peak yesterday. Thinking of the hardship, the sole purpose is to seek food and survive, and everyone is rushing to buy japonica rice, not buying glutinous rice, buying soybeans, adzuki beans, corn, and sorghum, without any satisfaction. People are crowded together, and adzuki beans have also risen to 2 yuan and 4 jiao per catty, which is usually only 1 yuan and 6 or 7 jiao. There are indeed many people carrying national rice on the streets. Unfortunately, those whose loads exceed the limit are confiscated, and the number of confiscated loads, including the rice carried by the citizens themselves, is alarming and pitiful. Even at dusk, there were still many rice vendors on the streets, and prices had fallen below 50 yuan. There were also rumors that the market would immediately plummet, all because the rice had nowhere to go and had to be sold cheaply. However, few people were interested, so it was a little over ten yuan lower than the previous day. Southbound late rice opened at 340 yuan, 330 yuan, and then 320 yuan. Kunshan North Japonica was 395 yuan. However, rice shops were not selling rice, and selling prices were far above that, still not available for less than 5 or 60 yuan. Therefore, the profits earned by various grain stores in the past two days are enough to compensate for seven years of work.</p>
<h3>Fortunate Ones Among Merchants</h3>
<p>The recent market volatility has been good for a few types of businesses. First, military notes that were previously around 4 yuan are now selling for around 7 yuan, and the profits are considerable. In addition, the reserve notes, which were previously at par, are now being sold at a premium of 20-30% on the market. There are still two or three batches of people lined up in front, and you have to arrive early just to get in line. How can profits not be high? Secondly, food, whether it is rice, corn, sorghum, beans, or wheat, as long as it can alleviate hunger, the price of national rice has risen from 320-330 yuan per stone to 600 yuan in two days, which is 40 times higher than before the war, a rise of 260-270 yuan in two days. Where can you find such a business? It's just that the corn reserves are too small and the weevil damage is too serious, so it can only be temporarily prohibited, and you can't eat good rice. The result is that adzuki beans are flying high at over 2 yuan a catty. Sorghum flour also sells for 1.8 or 9 yuan, and even mixed with bran sells for 1.6 yuan. Cut noodles are over 2 yuan per unit, and you still have to stand in line to wait. Thirdly, stores selling foreign powder, cooking oil, and cigarette paper benefit. Military notes rise every day, and the price of goods rises step by step. The amount of money grows more and more every day, how can you not be happy? This has also led to a surge in daily necessities. Soap and matches are all good, and prices are soaring. A box of Lao Pai Gu Ben soap that used to cost 5 or 6 yuan now costs 220 yuan and there are still people who want it. The most hateful thing is that it is inconvenient to speculate on cotton yarn, so they are desperately raising the price of cloth, which is now three or four times more expensive than silk. A cloth long gown costs over a hundred silver dollars. Trying to stop stealing chickens is like the chicken is still there, and prices are rising like spring breezes. Life is just like flipping over. It's terrible to be making wedding clothes for others, and the calculations don't add up.</p>
<h3>There May Be Solutions for Soybean Oil; Miscellaneous Grains Soar Unabated</h3>
<p>With miscellaneous grains soaring, those holding bran seize the opportunity to raise prices, causing market prices to skyrocket. Sanxin large-bag bran even opened at a staggering 1,034 yuan. Rumors of hoarding and unloading then arose, causing a sudden drop to 95.5 yuan, and small bags to 96 yuan.</p>
<p>Qingdao unrefined oil, over two thousand barrels have arrived, together with the previous shipments, totaling more than four thousand barrels, amounting to one thousand three hundred tons. The oil industry wholesale office plans to allocate them within three or four days, which may temporarily alleviate the oil shortage.</p>
<p>Yang Heqing of the grain industry says that there are already considerable solutions for the sources of cooking oil and soybeans. Rice and corn still require instructions from the Changju (Municipal Government). The newly organized Shanghai Cooperative Business Office for Adjusting Civil Food, Rice, Wheat, and Miscellaneous Grains has also joined the Miscellaneous Grains Association as a special member, hoping to jointly concentrate efforts to solve the current difficulties.</p>

<h3>Reaffirming "Focus on Hygiene"</h3>
<p>— Zhi Cang</p>
<p>The way of hygiene is no longer a fashionable matter; however, we admit that we still need to live, so we have to talk about "hygiene," which is just like the five grains or even six grains, indispensable for a day. A group of refined gentlemen understand science, and their research into the way of hygiene starts with nutrition. For example, a person needs a certain amount of vitamins A, B, C, D every day, each with its due mission: if you don't eat cod liver oil, you will suffer from dry eye syndrome and rickets; if you don't eat beans or hygienic rice, you will get beriberi; if you can't buy Florida oranges, you will get scurvy and even endocrine atrophy; if you can't get "A" grade milk, you will suffer from neurasthenia, etc. Opening the encyclopedia of hygiene will reveal the same conclusions, and you can't help but applaud in amazement.</p>
<p>However, in this world that specializes in the way of hygiene, there will always be a group of "anti-hygienists" who are strangely pale and emaciated. What is the reason for this? Is it that the people can be made to follow, but not to know, without any basic hygiene knowledge? No, no, in the current world, to ask for a piece of tofu that slightly meets the nutritional standards (with protein and calcium) is about the price of meat, let alone the magnificent cod liver oil, Florida oranges, and "A" grade milk. Paying attention to the nutritional value of hygiene is certainly positive, but in short, lacking vitamin M, it is something that can only be hoped for but not achieved. So, let's talk about spiritual hygiene. In the early morning, before getting on the carriage to go to the streets, go to the park and laugh three times, or practice Tai Chi and feel it, but it is said to be a bit wasteful and harmful, the more you laugh, the more you won't have constipation or stomach problems.</p>
<p>That is truly pitiful and somewhat laughable. But spending all day frowning and being mentally depressed is not the way to live. Mozi said: "Those who rely on their strength live, those who do not rely on their strength do not live." A soft and weak appearance may save some "calories" on a person, but the activity of the power of survival will disappear. Eating less and worrying about things will definitely lead to elimination, so why bother.</p>
<p>Starting from lying lazily in bed and skipping breakfast, everything can be stopped. The floor is not swept, the table is not wiped, the children cry in the pile of urine, the rats can fight with the cats, and the room is filled with dust and foul air. Garbage is enough to relieve hunger, leaking rain doesn't matter, it can be used as a substitute for tea. Where does this kind of spiritual hygiene come from?</p>
<p>Mencius said: "I am good at nourishing my vast and upright spirit." Now it is difficult to eat, and it is not easy to eat six-grain flour; but for the sake of our lives, we have to talk about hygiene. Vitamins are hard to come by, and for the poor, hygiene is even more essential, which is definitely not the same as doing things perfunctorily. Born in sorrow, die in ease, is ultimately not a deceptive saying. As the weather gets warmer, pay extra attention to both household and public hygiene. Once there is illness, seeking medicine is truly a waste of money and effort.</p>

<h3>Stage and Screen</h3>
<p>The Russian song and dance troupe that performed at the Great Light Theater on the 6th of this month achieved satisfactory results, and the Asia Theater is quite pleased. At a time when the first-run movies are replaying old films, it is not a joy to have a stage performance with excellent attendance? Therefore, on the 20th and 21st of this month, performances will continue. Ticket prices remain the same, and it is heard that reservations can be made in advance at the Great Light.</p>
<p>Lu Luming is paid 1,000 yuan for performing "Song of Rejuvenation" at the Ruby, while Liu Qiong, Xia Xia, Tu Guangqi, Sima Yingcai, etc., receive only three yuan per performance at the Carlton. However, the actors performing "Compromising for Survival" at Zhang Garden receive nothing, not even transportation fees, which can be said to be truly "sacrificing for the sake of art."</p>

<h3>Sharing the Same Boat in Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(2) Sorrow and Joy</p>
<p>Huang Shifu handed the water pipe to his rickshaw puller and laughed: "Brother Weicheng, your mother's illness is extremely weak. And I heard that she received injections from a Western doctor, which makes me unsure. Now I have tentatively drafted this prescription. If you trust me, try a dose and see. Life and death depend on this. Otherwise, please invite some more skilled doctors from the countryside..." As he said this, he cupped his hands and walked out. At the door, he added, "The medicine from Liangxintang is good, other places won't do. Take forty or fifty yuan with you." Li Youxie and Weicheng escorted Huang Shifu to the gate, watching him get into the rickshaw and rattling away.</p>
<p>Back inside, Second Madam Ye was already taking out money, instructing Axing to go to Liangxintang in Huagang to get the medicine. Weicheng said, "Listening to him, the hope seems very small. I think Western doctor Lin's effect may be faster than traditional Chinese medicine." Li Youxie said, "Weicheng, you must not be indecisive again. Huang Shifu is the famous Huang the Madman. He is a family doctor; his father was the old madman, and he is the young madman. Now the young madman is also old. When he was young, he read medical books day and night. When people asked him to see a doctor, he would sit in the boat and continue reading his medical books; he didn't care when he passed through Huagang City River. Once, a family had a sudden illness and went to his house to ask for help. He had already gone out to see a patient. Later, his boat passed through Huagang City River on the way home. The person who asked for the doctor knew that it was midnight, so Huang the Madman would definitely not be willing to come ashore to see a patient. So, he carried two buckets of manure and placed them on the bridge, saying: Mr. Huang, if you don't come up to see a patient, I will pour the manure down. Huang the Madman had no choice but to come ashore and wrote a prescription, with only thirty-five small coins worth of medicine, and the illness was cured. Where would he need forty or fifty yuan? Now, things are really different than before." (22)</p>
