<p>我海軍在中日事變中、果完成如何之責任、茲趁此機會作綜合之概說、第一、在前綫之駐華艦隊、自華北事變發生後、即把握制海制空權、使重慶軍隊無法侵我寸士、帝國海軍作戰後一時閒確保、本近海。黃海。東海。南海等制海權、若再擴充言之、西太平洋之制海權亦爲我海軍所確保、同時制空權亦落於我海軍掌之握、此制空權者、在此次世界大戰發生前、並不被人重視、然現代之艦隊擁有航空母艦、軍艦上亦搭載飛機、海軍之航空兵力、成爲海軍力量之要素、所謂制海、亦包括制空之意義、制海權與制空權有不可分離之關係、如無制空權、則不能獲得制海權、第二、爲佔據中國沿海主要都市要港島嶼、正面遮斷彼方與外部之交通、中日事變、並無宣戰布告、故僅對中國船隻實行遮斷、在大東亞戰爭發生前、援渝之第三國船舶並未行使此種實力、此因中日事變之特異性之故、致使重慶方面益誤認爲日本無實力對付第三國、並以此激昂其七氣拖延戰事、第三、爲支配管理揚子江重慶方面深恐揚子江之管理落入我手、故在各處堅固構築耍塞、或敷設水電、或設置障碍物以防我海軍艦艇溯江而上、然我海軍加以突破、現在整個揚子江、完全在我海軍支配下、中國民衆中、經五年抗戰後、如有對日本陸海軍之威力及日本國力、作過少之評價、尚以爲最後勝利必屬於我者、不得不謂此人不能了解日本希望、善隣友好、互相挑手、以期東亞興隆、一切望中國民衆深切反省善爲處理興亞之轉換期會聞英美兩國前製成天文學上數字之龐大預算、誇稱「最後勝利必屬聯合國」云、相信亦有所如此觀念之中國民衆、然我海軍現於北自阿留地安羣島起迄美國西岸、南自雪梨四至馬達加斯加印度洋之廣泛海域進行大規模作戰、全馬來半島、荷屬東印度羣島。香港等悉入我手、對日本地理上戰略上在必勝之優越地位、强加辯論者、均係可笑之論、毫無一顧之價值、中日事變發生後之翌年（廿七年）、英國雜誌「兩週報」四月號載有英國海軍大將鄧維爾所著「自作戰上言太平洋之情形」之論說、該海軍大將歷任地中海艦隊參謀長、地中海第三巡洋艦隊司令官。海軍大學校長等職、彼之意見有一聆之價值、茲引述如次、以供參考、渠稱當日英同盟廢棄時、各方面不少表示反對者、然今日思之實屬遺憾云、叉云常此被採用巨艦主義之時代、在戰塲附近如無根據地、則艦隊欲遠距離行動、實屬困難、自此點言、新加坡軍港價值極爲重要、然今後一有急派艦隊往遠東之必要時、應授予司令長官之最低限度海軍力、至少必須與日本海軍有同等勢力之艦隊、然此種艦隊僅足進行以新加坡爲根據之防禦作戰艦隊苟欲循戰略之正途、在日本近海作戰則必須至少較日本戰隊優越五成之艦隊更進一步、如萬一與日本作戰、則不獨五成之優勢、舉英國全海軍力量、恐猶不足應付、遠東一告動亂、即將波及歐洲、此爲洞若觀火之事實、現在日德義三國運繁、即任何政府決不料及舉英國全海軍力派往遠東、故英國結果唯有斷絕派艦隊往遠東之念頭、在可謂第二洛席斯德魏斯基提督當日俄海戰時、任爲俄國艦隊司令官之司令官指導下派遺貧弱之艦隊、以負困難之使命、此外別無他法矣、若此時美國能協力吾人、則形勢當將一變、然美國在日本近海並無根據地、必須作極長距離之渡洋作戰、故美國作戰困難、最近報紙刊載用心良深之計劃、擬利用新加坡。珍珠灣。阿留地安羣島等遠隔地點爲據點、對日本實施封鎖、實爲可笑之計劃、此種遠距離封鎖之第一結果、英美在中國之權益、先爲日本一掃而光、此種計劃僅爲與日本以沒收英美在華權益之藉口而已、世界上頗多不肯直視現實、或自已不能實行而專事威嚇者、重慶迄今仍固執抵抗、此對重慶是否爲賢明之措置、僅以余現在所得之資料尚不能下正確之判斷、唯恐重慶將蹈阿比西尼亞皇帝之覆轍、徒然依賴空虛之希望與約定、余甚感不安、若謂坐視重慶、則聯盟理想主義者定將感覺不快、然欲回復東亞和乎、則唯有對日本以更友好之態度云、</p>
<p>現在美國遠東艦隊已告潰滅、英國遠東艦隊亦然、上述「聯合國必勝　之議論、因新加坡其時尚存在之故、然現在英美遠東之根據地全部爲我方所掌握、其欲日本屈服、必須先將各根據地予以奪回、然此事永不能成爲事實、該英國海軍大將所著之論說、今日視之、其所論者、無一不成爲事實、對其卓見深表敬意、並希望對誤認「最後勝利必屬英美」之民衆、介紹此文一讀、以促其反省、</p>

<h3>阿刺伯的古與今（三）　回教統一前</h3>
<p>阿刺伯在地形上說來，大要分爲南北二部，南部近海洋邊綫，稱爲快樂的阿刺伯。北部山區，稱爲石骨阿刺伯。而近宗的阿刺伯人，—即被稱爲貝篤因人者，—則住在石骨阿刺伯一帶。此地日爲埃及與東亞交通大道。這裹現在過的是部落游牧生涯，而在古時也是過的部落游收生涯。</p>
<p>阿刺伯人不但與古亞述人巴比侖人叙里亞人猶太人腓尼基人迦太基人等屬於同種，而且在傳說上阿刺伯人與猶太人的最高風先，同是那有名的阿伯拉罕。（請參讀宗教聖地巴力斯坦一文）只可惜這　系的阿伯拉罕子孫，要一直釗西元後六世紀未，才在歷史上出風頭，沒有如猶太上巴比侖人的那麽早。傳說上首先進入阿刺伯半島的，是阿伯拉罕的兒子伊斯美爾和伊斯美爾的母親—即阿伯拉罕的妻—哈迦爾事實上，阿刺伯文與希伯來文宇根上很有相同之處。兩民族有密切關係的傳說，不是無因的。而日舊約創世紀中，也說到伊斯美爾「他是一個野　人，人家反對他，他也反對人家！」</p>
<p>這一批阿伯拉罕的子孫，—貝篤因人—一直過着游牧的生活，沒有改變過。他們驕傲於自己的血統，愛自由，愛部落，愛古傳統，勇終作戰而狡獪，却也正義好客而强硬。他們驚守宗教，愛好知識，因環境的關係，身體特別矯健。</p>
<p>這些貝篤因人自古以來即愛好兩種重要的牲畜。一是馬，一是駝。都是全世界川各的好東西。馬助作戰，駝助運輸，使阿刺伯人成了一個既能作戰又能經商的民族。</p>
<p>這些簡單而勇敢的民族，也受到種種侵略。亞述國王埃沙哈同，終西元前七世紀時侵入北阿刺伯。羅馬人會把北阿刺伯作為羅馬帝國的行省。南阿刺伯曾陷入新波斯王國之手，當穆罕默德出世的時候，阿比西尼亞的國王，會於六世紀時侵入了南部。</p>
<p>古阿刺伯的城市，本來要推葉門，後來乃由麥加和麥地那起而代之。麥加的地位，爲兩條重要大道的交又點。—一條由叙里亞到南阿刺伯，一條由阿比西尼亞到東南亞洲。麥加城中有一個寺，名曰卡阿巴（Kaaba），是阿刺伯人宗教信仰的中心。守遺個寺的，是一個部落，名叫柯萊昔。—是伊斯美十二個兒子中最聰明的一個兒子的後裔—因爲守寺的關係，這一部落，就專川祭師。六世紀未時，阿比西尼亞人未能侵到麥加，以基督教的勢力掃蕩全阿刺伯，這算是阿刺伯人的一個宗教上的幸事。</p>
<p>阿刺伯人傳說，麥加城乃亞丹所造。卡阿巴廟，乃阿伯拉罕所建。因爲伊斯美爾遷住麥加，所以麥加城繁盛起來。城中有一口滿儲黑水的井，名曰善善井，是天使與伊斯美母親通話之處。</p>
<p>麥地那城的地位，在交通上，並不重要，但有自然的資源。麥地那城中的人，一向妒忌麥加城地位的優良，所以後來穆罕默德出亡到麥地那時，城中人就一力幫助穆氏。</p>
<p>古阿刺伯人，長於文學，熱心於詩篇與雄辯，頗如希臘之阿靈比亞大會一樣，各部落每年集會一次。在大會上，詩人競唱詩篇。但他們對於科學則不甚關心。他們的歷史，只是一些年表。他們的天文學，只能辨別四季。他們安心於上帝所給與的四件東西，—纏頭布，慕帳，刀劍和詩篇。</p>
<p>阿刺伯人的宗教生活，頗爲深厚。阿刺伯人的古宗教，是薩比安偶像崇拜教。所崇拜的對象楚日月星辰。但此外還有各種宗教信仰。有的堅守組先的教條，有的信波斯的魔術，有的信猶太教，有的竟接受了基督教。在穆罕默德出世以前，阿刺伯人的宗教，是一神論和多神論混合的，—猶太　不能統一阿刺伯半島。這宗教教，基督教，魔術，偶像崇拜統一的工作，要讓穆罕德來奏。—可是基督教和猶太教都功。</p>
<p>麥加朝聖盛况回教徒年赴麥加朝聖，從非洲與亞洲南部出發者，　皆取道紅海至吉大，轉赴麥加聖地。圖為阿刺伯船　滿載朝聖教徒，駛入吉大港之盛況。</p>

<h3>房租問題　陷於混亂狀態　亟盼當局頒佈確切條例制止二房東榨取三房客</h3>

<h3>堅苦奮鬥才是生活</h3>
<p>— 高佳基</p>
<p>有一次，一個靑年寫信給一位長者，請他替他找「一個輕易的位置」。那長者的覆信說：「你不能做編輯；別當律師；別想做收師；丟開所有的船，店，和商品；別做農夫，也別故在械師；別當兵，也別做水手，不下要工作；不耍研究；不要想。因是這些事淸，沒有一件是輕易的。孩子，你已經來到一個報苦的世界上了！在這個世界上，我曉得祇有一個輕易的位置，那就楚墳墓。」</p>
<p>如果我們很早就曉得，在人生的任何職業中，並沒有甚麼「輕易的位置」，那麼一定可以减省不少的麻煩和失望。人生就是戰鬥，不是一只安樂椅；人生是長期的苦戰，不是一個狂歡節，人生是對你的才能的挑戰，不是一服安眠劑。</p>
<p>堅苦驚門才是生活！（節譯自霍夫曼原著）</p>
<p>小品</p>
<h3>帽子</h3>
<p>— 王禾木</p>
<p>在晴期的早上，家門口總坐着一個叫周　着許多小孩的老頭兒，他用草編淸蜻蜓呀，田雞呀甚麽的玩物。他不大說話，手裏編着，編着有時偶然抬起頭對興奮着的孩子們笑笑。</p>
<p>本來麽，一個上年紀的人還繼續着用自己的力量生活下去，已够叫你佩服了，但如果你看見他那鎮定，從容的態度和那副隱然藏着看智慧之光的眼，你更會對他增加一份深深的敬意。</p>
<p>開他忽然不來了，孩子可有點寂寞。</p>
<p>一天，我走過一條淸靜，修長的路，突然的，看見了一個熟悉的背影，哦，那可愛的自髮：背在背上的深褐色，古老的藝木箱，穩健行的脚步：是的，這正是那個老人呀，……我招呼了他，問他幹嗎怎麽久不去找們那裹，他對我頗爲唐突甚至有點可笑的熱誠感到了驚異，可是立刻我在他的嘴角，找到個動人的善意的老人的微笑。他告訴我他家就在附近，要我去坐坐。</p>
<p>那是一座瓦平屋，光綫很弱，家具簡單極了。</p>
<p>「哈哈，」他說，「這可以算是赤費了吧，可是純潔的赤貧是可愛的。……</p>
<p>他告訴我他有一個兒子在遼遠的地方；他自己本是做教員的，這仃手藝還是一年前才學上的；這眞有點使大吃驚了。他話說這很多，和住常很不同。我一直沈默着，想想看吧，一個老人學會一種手藝給持生活，保持着生活的勇氣，不能不使人感勸吧！</p>
<p>最後他對我說，「是的，我是赤貧的，可是我的兒子將來可以在我這裹得到一份遺產—一個乾淨的姓氏，將來他可以驕傲地告訴人家，他父親是個正直入，從沒有賺過、個下流錢到老年時還靠自己的力量生活着……我常常語住一句話；「我們應該揭掉那使我們溫暖，但遮住我們視續綫的帽子。」……」</p>
<p>我走川他家的時候，我想，他不但將給他兒子一份寶貴的遺產，也給了我一份寶貴的禮物了。我覺得我有替我的孩子們留一份遺產——一個乾淨的姓氏必要。親愛的讀者，這是我轉送給你們的禮物：</p>
<p>我們要揭掉那使我們溫暖</p>
<p>但遮住我們的視綫的帽子。」</p>

<h3>工作的代價</h3>
<p>— 安且尼</p>
<p>讀六月十一日自由談上林保先生「花匠」一文終，覺得有點話要說。</p>
<p>林保先生告訴我們有次他走過一個荒廢的花園，看見兩個花匠在辛勤的工作；隔了幾個月後，再走過那地方，已是花盛開充滿了生氣了。於是林保先生覺得那兩個花匠雖然工作重報酬少，但他們的工作並不楚沒有意義的。</p>
<p>也許他們的工作並不是無意義的，也許這種服務人類的精神楚值得我們人生園的花匠效法的，可是最好我們不要離實際太遠，無論如何，報酬的分景不和工作的分量相等，工作重於報酬，總楚這社會的嚴重病態之一。我們是不該忽略了有錢人的財富僅是大部份工作重於報酬的人的勞力的堆積這一點的。</p>
<p>要大家效法那二位花匠的服務精神，我相信在林保先生是抱着絕對的善意的，道也許是對工作過度的疲倦了的人們的一針興奮劑，可是這不楚也可能在無意中成爲一種麻醉劑——用「空言的安慰」中和工作過度者的怨恨情緒的麻醉劑嗎？如果花匠在果寶尚未開出來的時候，就已餓死在荒蕪的花園的地上，不該會是一種殘酷的諷刺嗎？</p>
<p>我以爲世界上的工作，如果可以稱爲工作，並非一囤積居奇」的活動之類的話，總多少有點意義，對大家不無裨益的，不求聞達也是一種良好的人生態度；可是報酬一定要等於——至少要近於工作的價值，這一條定律楚一定要運守的。雖然這似乎有點個人主義的色彩，可是不肯虧待自己，爲自己爭合法的利益，總該不是一件可恥的事吧。</p>
<p>「一要生存，二要溫飽，三要發展。苟有阻礙這前途者，無論是古是今，是人是鬼，是三墳五典，百宋十元，天球河圖，金人玉佛，祖傳丸散，秘製齊丹，全都踏倒他。」（魯迅語）是的，「一要生存，二要溫飽」，即使自我犧牲」這一類名詞也不行，凡是足以阻礙我們這一點小的要求的，都得踏倒他，殘酷地踏倒他。</p>
<p>人情</p>
<h3>一個「猢猻王」的遭遇　—竟受今日之之困·又何怨</h3>
<p>— 風馬牛</p>
<p>林先生在沒有做「猢猻王」之前，還是當他拿到一張經濟學十的文憑的時候，是懷着偌大的志願，可是好似命運安排了他做一個「猢猻王」，幾次想進銀行，沒有保，而還得打從練習生做起，又不高興，裁昌的多，要人的少，少攀籘的親戚；於是把林先生獃了幾個月，但幸而「運氣」還算好，託人輾轉介紹，做了「猢騵王」—一個衖堂小學，二三百小「猢騵」擠得滿滿的，門口卻永遠掛着一尚有餘額」的牌子；林先生担任的是高年級，五六年級混合制，是級任，可是學校裹的一切佈告甚麽，也派定了林先生寫，似乎叉楚書記，然而又不是，因爲薪水裹好像沒有算這一筆，只是算授課的鐘點—一個月拼攏起來是一百不到，九十五元的模樣。</p>
<p>然而爲了九十五元大洋，林先生像包身工」一樣出賣了整天的光陰，早上匕點鐘從家裏到校裏去，便開始站在黑板前揮粉筆和開話匣子；這時倒眞的顯得林先生「博學多才」，不但担任了英國史地，自然等等主要科，而且勞作，美術，音樂林先生也能來一手，不過，林先生時常感到授課的困難，一隻蘋莫的描慕，畫在黑板上自己也覺得「怪像」，而音樂呢，林先生既乏「金嗓」，同時也只能勉强按得一手風琴，在課上是感到頭痛萬分，可是，下了課，該可休息了吧，然而不，得替校長盡些「義務」，抄抄鋼板，寫寫佈告，那麼，總得有些「犒賞」，　如吃一頓豐富的午餐也吧，然而不，早就合同在先「不供午膳」，林先生只好「自備」了，外面吃一餐太貴，於是自己帶些隔夜冷飯，和些乾小菜，請學校裏的廚房司務熱一熱，胡亂吃了一頓，又開始下午的功課，要到四五點鐘才回家，回家了，改卷子，枇課卷，弄得頭昏眼花從早上到睡覺，林先生似乎是這私立小學的奴隸。</p>
<p>這種「奴隸」生活，林先生也未嘗不想脫離，既吃不飽又餓不死，薪水這樣少。付了房錢，就買　還須借債。可是林先生叉像隻金絲雀，川了囚籠會慌張失措，日脚過不下去，於是只好拖一日算　日了　到了最近，六月月份的薪水改了儲幣券，是折半，但教師聯名加薪，校長卻慷慨答應林先生的薪水變了六十五元，合折起來比從前多一點，雖然同時電車漲了價！</p>
<p>可是不巧得很，父是個「同時」—「聽說」下學期這衡堂小學校長「無意經營」了，轉盤給某中學的校長，爲的是學費加了價學生到得少，開銷又較前大些，雖然自己沒有蝕本，可是於愛賺錢的精明校長卻不滿足，覺得這「生意」少汕水，郤費精神，決定出讓，「生財像伙」等等，可以馬上變現鈔，在校長，這又是可以使手頭「活」一些的好法子。</p>
<p>這消息，林先生起先沒注意，後來，在大老前一個禮拜，校長請了頓飯，校長發表了篇動人的演說，先感謝後訴苦，結果這「聽說　便證實了下學期盤讓給×××先生　某中學的校長。</p>
<p>桌子，凳子，黑板，學生　都得移交」了，可是獨沒有提起教員，不過有認得那校長的，得到了連任，而林先生，不認得也不會「鐵」，新校長也沒有請教到林先生，林先生便「次」了。</p>
<p>「我沒有人受盤」，林先生苦笑於說，林先生　在像火爐的小亭子間裹，在「待聘」！</p>
<h3>嘉言</h3>
<p>— 小紫</p>
<p>能不作情欲的奴隸的人就是英雄。　高里靑</p>

<p>人生</p>
<h3>自尊與驕傲</h3>
<p>— 黃文錦</p>
<p>我覺得每個人都應該有自尊心—尊重自己的人格，尊重自己的思想，行爲和責任。</p>
<p>在成功之路卜，沒有自尊的人是決不會留下他的艱深的步痕的·你知道麥考萊在寶年時是非常自奪的嗎？七歲時，他便懷着滿腹大志寫起一本「世界歷史」來；你想，以一個稚童的思想來處理這繁難的工作，誰會對這渺茫的豪志不啞然失笑呢？可是，日後他竟成了英國文學界中一朶璀璨奇葩</p>
<p>但是，自尊並不楚　傲，更不是固執自大。因爲，驕傲是卑視一切的，視別人都低於自己，從而自大起來。一個靑年驕傲之後，就不肯虛心學習，只有葬送在自己的驕傲中。</p>

<h3>兩用坦克車</h3>
<p>— 張喬</p>
<p>坦克車的輸子告爲齒練式，其長處在於能在崎嶇的道路上進行，其短處在於速度遲綏，如今有一種新式的兩用坦克車發明，又名萬能坦克車。它可以在山地進行，也可以在坦路上前進。因爲它除了齒練式掄帶以外，還有車胎輸。在凹凸的路上行進，便把車胎輪吊到上面來，到了平地上，再把它們放下，便利無比。近日關終歐非的戰訊中，都楚坦克大戰，不知這種坦克車是否也出現終共中呢。</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 向家支</p>
<p>（六）一彈指</p>
<p>維城在看書，實際上也可以說是瞑想，國芳國器的環境好得多，第一，這居處是鬧中取靜；第二，慈祥的祖母和老成的女　，以少許劵過我家裏的多許：事三……陳東老太太吃完了飯來招待了。開談中一句，是很够刺激的：「葉少爺，你也可以娶新少奶奶了。」維城只是一笑。接着他要找大褂，準備回去，陳老太太不讓走說：一住在這裏，等他們回來吧，他們回來，也只是一兩天的事。」維城想，這是於情於輝都不許可的。陳老太太挽留到後來，說至少吃西瓜再走。維城推辭不掉，便吃了西瓜。那西瓜眞够甜味，從甜味上想到陳老太太會做穌糖，可惜時令不對，現在不是吃穌糖的時候。</p>
<p>維城留了一張字條在桌子，大意是我來了　，你沒有回來，令人惆悵，你不定在一天回來，請於二十四小時內設法通知我爲荷。擱了筆再一看，字條上有着大大的缺點，當了陳老太太的面，又不能把先前寫的撕了重寫一張，這缺點楚什麼？原來這字條只寫了國芳的名字而沒有寫上國器，應該你們的地方也只寫了你，這是令使國器生氣的。沒奈何，只得重行提起筆來，在芳字邊贅了個器字，在你字旁邊加了個們字，訕訕的交給老媽子道：一等你少爺小姐回來，你就交給他們。」</p>
<p>他再三謝了陳老太太，陳老太太也念了好幾聲阿彌陀佛，直送到門外。他循着原路走回世德堂，到家，太陽還沒完全下去。翠珍業二太太，誰不是要向維城探問情形的，維城道：「他們兄妹，一個沒有回家，倒讓陳太伯母盛情招待了吃飯。」他把吃的飯菜，一樣樣背給嬸娘聽，連葉二太太也有些不安。翠珍道：「這是恒事，陳小姐說了回來會不回來，不知道她身體怎樣。」（一二三）</p>

<p>Manila, 8th (Domei News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese authorities previously experimented with planting Japanese Horai rice here and harvested it in June.

<h3>Turkish Prime Minister Saydam Dies of Heart Disease, Post Temporarily Held by Interior Minister Tucer, Saydam Was a Famous Doctor and Professor</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 8th (Havas News Agency Telegram) - Prime Minister Saydam, while on vacation here, was very busy yesterday dealing with the food supply issue. He attended a banquet at the City Hall in the evening and returned to his residence before midnight. A few minutes later, he suddenly suffered a stroke. By the time the doctor arrived, he had already passed away. President Ismet has ordered Interior Minister Tucer to temporarily assume the duties of the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Ankara, 8th (Haitong News Agency Telegram) - Turkish Prime Minister Saydam died of heart disease in Istanbul at midnight today. Turkish Interior Minister Tucer has been ordered to temporarily assume the post of Prime Minister. Saydam was deeply valued by the Turkish President, so he had the power to influence Turkey's foreign and domestic affairs. Saydam's cabinet was formed on January 28, 1939, and although the cabinet was repeatedly changed thereafter, Saydam's position remained unchanged. It has not yet been decided whether his remains will be moved to Ankara as of this morning.</p>
<p>Ankara, 8th (Haitong News Agency Telegram) - Turkish Prime Minister Saydam, who passed away this morning, was born in Istanbul in 1881. He studied medicine at Istanbul University and went to Germany for further studies after graduation. After returning to Turkey, he practiced medicine and soon became a famous doctor and professor. When Ismet Inonu was the Turkish Prime Minister, he appointed Saydam as the Minister of Health and Social Welfare. During his tenure, he made great contributions to the improvement of public health in Turkey. After Bayar organized the cabinet in 1937, Saydam resigned, but he still held a seat in parliament representing Istanbul. When Bayar organized the cabinet for the second time, he appointed Saydam as the Minister of Interior. In 1939, Bayar submitted his resignation, and the Turkish President appointed Saydam as Prime Minister. Saydam formed a new government on January 25, and from that day until the day of his death, Saydam served as the head of the Turkish government.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 8th (Haitong News Agency Telegram) - After Saydam's death, the question of who will take over as the Turkish Prime Minister has become a topic of discussion among the people of Istanbul. Currently, the post of Prime Minister is temporarily held by Interior Minister Dr. Tucer. It is believed that President Ismet Inonu will not delay the decision on the Prime Minister's selection for long, given the seriousness of the military and political situation in both the north and south, and from the current situation, the reorganization of a new cabinet in Turkey has great significance. The news of Saydam's sudden death was announced by radio this morning, and most newspapers published the news on the front page within a black border. In the past two years, Saydam and President Ismet have cooperated to handle wartime domestic and foreign affairs, turning danger into safety, which has been praised by many.</p>

It is difficult for any event to succeed if it does not receive the understanding of those involved. He now hopes that the Congress Party and the Muslim League can understand and compromise with each other.</p>

<h3>Press Officer of the Japanese Fleet in China, Colonel Kamata, Broadcasts a Speech, Citing British Admiral Domvile</h3>
<p>According to Domei News Agency, Colonel Kamata, Press Officer of the Japanese Fleet in China, delivered a radio speech on August 8th at 9:00 PM from the Greater East Asia Broadcasting Station, entitled "Welcoming the Fifth Anniversary of the China Incident." In the end, he quoted the writings of British Admiral Domvile in 1938, strongly stating that Britain would never be able to fight in East Asia, which is worthy of attention. The original text of the speech is recorded as follows: The China Incident was the fuse for the Greater East Asia War. In the four and a half years before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, it had formed the backbone of the new East Asian order and the ideal of the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the complete handling and conclusion of the Greater East Asia War meant that this ideal was finally completed, establishing true and permanent peace in East Asia.</p>
<p>What responsibilities has our navy fulfilled in the China Incident? I would like to take this opportunity to give a comprehensive overview. First, the Japanese Fleet in China grasped control of the sea and air in the front lines since the outbreak of the North China Incident, so that the Chongqing army could not invade our territory. After the start of the war, the Imperial Navy ensured the control of the sea in the Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and South China Sea. To expand on this, the control of the sea in the Western Pacific was also secured by our navy, and at the same time, the control of the air also fell into the hands of our navy. This control of the air was not valued before the outbreak of this World War, but modern fleets possess aircraft carriers, and warships also carry aircraft. The naval air power has become an essential element of naval power. The so-called control of the sea also includes the meaning of control of the air. Control of the sea and control of the air are inseparable. Without control of the air, one cannot obtain control of the sea. Second, we occupied the main coastal cities, ports, and islands in China to directly block the traffic between the other side and the outside world. The China Incident did not have a declaration of war, so only Chinese ships were blocked. Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the third-country ships aiding Chongqing did not exercise this power. This was due to the peculiarity of the China Incident, which made the Chongqing side increasingly misinterpret that Japan had no power to deal with third countries, and used this to incite its war sentiments and prolong the war. Third, we dominate and manage the Yangtze River. The Chongqing side was deeply afraid that the management of the Yangtze River would fall into our hands, so they firmly constructed strongholds everywhere, or laid underwater mines, or set up obstacles to prevent our naval vessels from going up the river. However, our navy broke through them, and now the entire Yangtze River is completely under the control of our navy. Among the Chinese people, after five years of resistance, if there are those who have made little evaluation of the power of the Japanese army and navy and the national power of Japan, and still believe that final victory must belong to me, it must be said that this person cannot understand Japan's hope, good neighborliness, mutual assistance, in order to revitalize East Asia. I hope that all Chinese people will deeply reflect on and properly handle the transitional opportunities for the rise of Asia. I heard that the United States and Britain previously made astronomical budgets, boasting that "final victory must belong to the United Nations." I believe that there are also some Chinese people with this view. However, our navy is now conducting large-scale operations in the vast waters from the Aleutian Islands in the north to the west coast of the United States, and from Sydney to Madagascar in the Indian Ocean in the south. The entire Malay Peninsula, Dutch East Indies, Hong Kong, etc., are all in our hands. Anyone who strongly debates Japan's geographical and strategic advantages in inevitable victory is ridiculous and not worth considering. The year after the outbreak of the China Incident (1938), the British magazine "The Fortnightly Review" published an article in its April issue written by British Admiral Domvile entitled "The Situation in the Pacific from an Operational Point of View." The Admiral had served as Chief of Staff of the Mediterranean Fleet, Commander of the Mediterranean Third Cruiser Squadron, and Principal of the Naval War College. His opinion is worth listening to. I will quote it as follows for reference. He said that when the Anglo-Japanese Alliance was abandoned, many people expressed opposition, but thinking about it today, it is a pity. He also said that in the age when the battleship was adopted, it was difficult for the fleet to move over long distances without a base near the battlefield. From this point of view, the value of the Singapore naval base is extremely important. However, if there is a need to dispatch a fleet to the Far East in an emergency, the Commander-in-Chief should be granted the minimum naval power, at least a fleet with the same strength as the Japanese Navy. However, this fleet is only sufficient to conduct defensive operations based on Singapore. If the fleet wants to follow the correct strategic path and fight in the waters near Japan, it must have a fleet that is at least 50% superior to the Japanese fleet. Furthermore, if we were to fight Japan, not only a 50% advantage, but even the entire naval power of Britain would probably not be enough to cope. If the Far East were to become turbulent, it would immediately affect Europe. This is a clear and obvious fact. Now that the three countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy are prospering, no government would have expected to send the entire British naval force to the Far East, so Britain can only give up the idea of sending a fleet to the Far East. Under the guidance of a commander who can be called the second Rozhestvensky, who was the commander of the Russian fleet during the Russo-Japanese War, a weak fleet is dispatched to take on a difficult mission, and there is no other way. If the United States could cooperate with us at this time, the situation would change, but the United States has no base near Japan and must carry out extremely long-distance transoceanic operations, so it is difficult for the United States to fight. Recent newspapers have published well-intentioned plans to use distant locations such as Singapore, Pearl Harbor, and the Aleutian Islands as bases to impose a blockade on Japan, which is a laughable plan. The first result of this long-distance blockade is that British and American interests in China will be swept away by Japan, and this plan is merely an excuse for Japan to confiscate British and American interests in China. There are many in the world who are unwilling to face reality, or who only threaten without being able to implement. Chongqing still stubbornly resists. Whether this is a wise measure for Chongqing, I cannot make a correct judgment with the information I have now, but I am afraid that Chongqing will follow in the footsteps of the Ethiopian Emperor, relying in vain on empty hopes and promises. I am very uneasy. If we sit idly by and watch Chongqing, alliance idealists will feel unpleasant, but to restore peace in East Asia, we can only treat Japan with a more friendly attitude.</p>
<p>Now the US Far East Fleet has been annihilated, and so has the British Far East Fleet. The above-mentioned argument that "the United Nations will surely win" is because Singapore still existed at that time, but now all the British and American bases in the Far East are in our hands. If they want Japan to surrender, they must first recapture the bases, but this can never become a reality. Looking at the writings of the British Admiral today, none of what he said has not become a reality. I express my deep respect for his foresight, and I hope to introduce this article to the people who mistakenly believe that "the final victory will surely belong to Britain and the United States" to promote their reflection.</p>
<h3>Intense Battle Between German and Soviet Forces in Voronezh, West of the City; Timoshenko Plans New Defense Line to Relieve Red Army's Encirclement in That Area</h3>
<p>Moscow, August 8th, Allied News Agency - German troops finally crossed the upper reaches of the Don River on Tuesday night and entered the Voronezh province steppe eastward. This is the deepest the German army has penetrated into Soviet territory since the beginning of the war, threatening the communication lines between the Soviet central and southern armies. According to an official announcement from Moscow, in several extremely fierce battles, due to the numerical superiority of the German troops and their equipment, the Don River defense line has been bypassed behind Voronezh.</p>
<p>Moscow, August 8th, Allied News Agency - After the German army reached the Voronezh area, they advanced about 130 miles east from Kursk and are now about 400 miles north of the entrance to the Caucasus. The Soviet command acknowledged that the Soviet forces in the Stary Oskol area, who were blocking the German advance from Belgorod towards Voronezh, have retreated to rear positions. The Soviet command also announced that fierce fighting is taking place southwest of Stary Oskol. From this, it can be seen that the troops under General von Bock are attacking from both sides of the salient, having advanced more than 100 miles east from Kursk. It is reported that the German army is currently deploying fresh troops to fight, striving to advance.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the Don region, July 7th, Havas News Agency - A radio station here has just broadcast a Red Army war report stating, "Fierce battles are taking place west of Voronezh and southwest of Oskol, continuing throughout the day. There is nothing else of note in other areas." It has been found that fighting has been ongoing in the Voronezh area since yesterday. The German forces under General Bock advanced rapidly, occupying the city of Schigrino, and then, under the cover of tanks and aircraft, crossed the Voronezh River and continued to advance. Within 24 hours, the German army had reached the suburbs of Voronezh, deploying new positions on the Kharkov-Saratov railway line to continue fighting. Once the German army occupies Voronezh, they will take advantage of the victory to pursue. Currently, they are attacking the city from two directions, one starting from Valuyki and attacking east, and the other starting from Shilov and attacking west. The Red Army is putting up strong resistance in the Valuyki area. General Timoshenko clearly intends to establish a new defense line east of it. After the Red Army repelled the German forces on the banks of the Krasnaya River, their situation in the Kupiansk area has improved, because the German forces in that area are isolated and weak, and seem to have been ordered to withdraw. General Timoshenko's objective is to relieve the Red Army's encirclement west of Voronezh. As for the Taganrog area, yesterday was peaceful, with the Red Army only launching another attack today, fiercely bombarding the city of Taganrog with artillery and aircraft. However, the German forces are strong enough to defend their original positions. In addition, the fighting in the Crimea area has come to an end. A portion of the German-Romanian forces has been transferred from the Sevastopol line to reinforce the Donets River basin, while the remaining troops have been transferred to the Kerch Peninsula. Therefore, it is believed that the German army will soon attack the Caucasus.</p>
<p>Berlin, July 7th, Allied News Agency - The German High Command announced today that the Soviet army suffered casualties of between 30,000 and 40,000 in the Battle of Sevastopol, with 97,000 captured. German casualties were 24,111, including 872 officers.</p>
<p>German Strategy of Deception; Soviets Counterattack in the North of Orel</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet Border, July 7th, Havas News Agency - It has been 380 days since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war. The strategically important Soviet city of Voronezh fell today, which German military figures consider to be of great significance. This key city is a Soviet railway hub. American armaments transported from the ports of Murmansk and Arkhangelsk to the southern route are transported via the Moscow-Rostov railway, all passing through Voronezh. Furthermore, oil from the Caucasus transported to the northern route must also pass through this key city. In addition, Voronezh is one of the Soviet Union's industrial centers. Important war industries are concentrated in the city, including the Voroshilov Aircraft Factory (employing 12,000 workers), the Stalin Aircraft Factory (employing 5,000 workers), the Comintern Rubber Factory (employing 10,000 workers), the Kuibyshev Ammunition Factory, and the Railway Materials Factory, among others. The first phase of the offensive launched by General Bock has been completed, but fierce fighting is still ongoing. The German army and its allies continue to advance eastward, while General Timoshenko is launching a counterattack north of the Orel area, but has failed to stop General Hoth's troops from continuing their advance. According to German reconnaissance aircraft reports, the Red Army's counterattack is small in scale. Therefore, General Timoshenko's actions are not expected to be successful. Military observers predict that the German-Soviet war will enter a new phase. General Bock's troops, divided into northern and southern routes, are advancing simultaneously, engaging in a large-scale war of annihilation. The characteristic of this German offensive is its skillful application, so the German High Command has completely concealed the true purpose of this operation. Until the very end, the Soviets did not understand the importance of the German strategy. The German army's offensive in the Kalinin area led the Soviets to mistakenly believe that General Bock had decided to attack on the northern route, and would not attack the Donets River basin. Unexpectedly, the opposite was true. General Bock advanced eastward, with the ultimate goal seemingly to advance on Stalingrad. However, before engaging in a large-scale war, General Bock must first clear the Red Army remnants in the Don River basin, which is without a doubt.</p>
<p>Berlin, August 8th, Huitong News Agency - Yesterday's German war report stated that the city of Voronezh, which was occupied by the German army, is the 12th largest city in the Soviet Union, with a population of 350,000, located on the east bank of the Don River, and is the capital of the Voronezh province. The distance between Kursk and Voronezh is approximately 255 kilometers.</p>
<h3>Air Combat Over Cairo Yesterday Morning; Situation Stable for British and Egyptian Forces in Egypt; Intense Artillery Battles in the Alamein Area</h3>
<p>Turkey, Istanbul, July 7th, Allied News Agency - According to a Cairo dispatch, Axis aircraft invaded the airspace over the Egyptian capital this morning. British aircraft immediately took off to intercept, and the two sides engaged in several rounds of combat. It was early in the morning, so few residents saw it. It is not known whether bombs were dropped.</p>
<p>Swiss Capital, July 7th, Havas News Agency - The Basler Nachrichten recently published a Cairo dispatch stating that Egyptian King Farouk has signed an order allocating £500,000 to strengthen the Egyptian army, and another £500,000 to compensate civilians for losses incurred during evacuations and to improve air defense facilities.</p>
<p>Swiss Capital, July 7th, Havas News Agency - The situation is stable for British forces in Egypt, which the Axis powers have also acknowledged. According to a Rome correspondent for the "Tribune de Genève," Italian newspapers generally believe that the British forces have established solid fortifications in the Alamein area. The construction of these fortifications was not done overnight, and not as some imagine, hastily built after the fall of Mersa Matruh. However, the main factor in the British resistance is the air force, as the air force is a powerful weapon in the Sahara war. The British have transferred a large number of aircraft from various parts of the Near East. At the same time, the British military supply center is nearby, making it easy to obtain supplies, which is also a favorable factor.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Egyptian Border, July 7th, Havas News Agency - The major battle in the Alamein area of Egypt has been ongoing for seven days. Artillery battles are intense, and infantry activity has decreased. The battle line stretches twenty miles south from the city of Alamein, then turns thirty-five miles west. The two armies' high commands are currently engaged in a fierce struggle, vying for victory. Some expect that German General Commander Rommel has decided to implement an encirclement strategy. In the last 24 hours, the Axis positions have continued to expand to the southwest. For the British, they are launching local attacks on the enemy's right flank to probe for weaknesses in their defensive line. It is believed that the British Commander-in-Chief in the Middle East has stopped the Axis advance. The current question is whether the British can drive back the enemy and recover recently lost positions. The infantry participating in the battle in that area are mostly New Zealand and South African troops. The armored division is composed of soldiers from the British mainland. The British 50th Infantry Division, which fought in the Gazala area, is currently being reorganized and will soon be sent to the front lines to fight. According to British claims, aircraft and tanks are arriving daily at the Egyptian front lines from countries throughout the Near East. However, they are not overly optimistic and acknowledge that fierce fighting is about to occur. If General Rommel does not exert all his strength to fight for Alexandria, he can consolidate the captured positions, making them a permanent threat to the Nile Delta. Under the current circumstances, the British's greatest effort is to concentrate their forces on destroying enemy communication lines, so that the German vanguard is cut off from their rear bases.</p>
<h3>Amery Declares in the House of Commons: Britain Will Not Withdraw Troops from India</h3>
<p>London, July 7th, Havas News Agency - During today's meeting of the House of Commons, Labour MP Davies asked whether the government had taken various steps to contact the leaders of the Indian National Congress in order to establish an Indian national cabinet so that it could take care of its own defense. Secretary of State for India Amery immediately replied that Britain does not intend to withdraw its troops from India, as the stationing of British troops in India is essential for the country's security and the final victory of the Allies. Until that victory is achieved, British troops will remain there, so the issue of India taking care of its own defense is not yet on the table.</p>
<p>London, July 7th, Havas News Agency - Today's meeting of the House of Commons discussed the final destination of fuel transported through the blockade line into Spain. According to the Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Economic Warfare, Foot, Britain is confident that this fuel will not be transshipped elsewhere, as the Spanish government guaranteed to the British government in 1940 that it would not allow the export of oil products, and there is currently no reason to believe that this guarantee has expired. Furthermore, the US Embassy in Madrid has dispatched an expert to monitor the entry and distribution of gasoline.</p>
<p>Command of the Middle East Air Force</p>
<p>London, July 7th, Havas News Agency - During today's meeting of the House of Commons, Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Taylor raised questions about the command of the Middle East Air Force. Prime Minister Churchill personally replied, "The air force currently fighting on the Egyptian border is not directly commanded by General Auchinleck, Commander of the British Forces in the Middle East. Review the instructions issued on October 7, 1941: The Commander of the Air Force in the Near East must assist the Commander-in-Chief of the Army in the area with all his strength. In other words, for all attack targets indicated by the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, the Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force shall use his aircraft within the most favorable strategy. This instruction has not been changed." Asked whether the Prime Minister intends to change the original order in order to strengthen the fighting power of the Near East, Prime Minister Churchill replied, "The government will consult various experts on this matter. The answers obtained are not uniform."</p>
<p>Stockholm, August 8th, Huitong News Agency - According to London news, British Prime Minister Churchill was once again the center of criticism during yesterday's meeting of the British House of Commons. Conservative MP Taylor questioned the Middle East Air Force's response to the war. Churchill replied that regarding the participation of the Middle East Air Force in the war, General Auchinleck must first discuss it with the Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East Air Force. The cooperation between the Middle East Army and Air Force is based on the order issued on October 7, 1941. Labour MP Bellinger asked whether the Army and Air Force could train together. Churchill replied that he had also considered this matter, but the results were the opposite. He was also asked whether communication between aircrews and ground personnel was satisfactory. Churchill replied that although it was not completely satisfactory, efforts were being made to improve it. Regarding the establishment of a Jewish legion in Palestine, the Secretary of State for War said that the Jews there had been trained as police, but the establishment of a legion was still difficult to implement. However, Jews could enlist in the British Army.</p>
<h3>Methane Gas Mine Discovered in Verona Province, Italy</h3>

<h3>Arabia, Past and Present (3) - Before Islamic Unification</h3>
<p>Topographically speaking, Arabia can be roughly divided into two parts: the southern part near the coastline, known as Happy Arabia, and the northern mountainous area, known as Stony Arabia. The nomadic Arabs, also known as Bedouins, live in the Stony Arabia area. This place has historically served as a major transportation route between Egypt and East Asia. The people here live a tribal nomadic life now, and they lived a tribal nomadic life in ancient times as well.</p>
<p>The Arabs not only belong to the same race as the ancient Assyrians, Babylonians, Syrians, Jews, Phoenicians, and Carthaginians, but also share the legendary Abraham as their common ancestor with the Jews (please refer to the article "Palestine, the Holy Land"). Unfortunately, these descendants of Abraham only rose to prominence in history at the end of the 6th century AD, later than the Jews and Babylonians. According to legend, the first to enter the Arabian Peninsula were Abraham's son Ishmael and Ishmael's mother, Hagar - Abraham's wife. In fact, Arabic and Hebrew have many similarities in their root words. The legend of a close relationship between the two peoples is not without reason. The Old Testament's Book of Genesis also says of Ishmael, "He will be a wild donkey of a man; his hand will be against everyone and everyone's hand against him."</p>
<p>These descendants of Abraham – the Bedouins – have continued to live a nomadic life, unchanged. They are proud of their bloodline, love freedom, love their tribe, love ancient traditions, are brave in battle and cunning, but also just, hospitable, and tough. They revere religion, love knowledge, and due to their environment, are particularly physically fit.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, these Bedouins have loved two important animals: the horse and the camel. Both are excellent things worldwide. Horses help in warfare, and camels help in transportation, making the Arabs a people capable of both fighting and trading.</p>
<p>These simple and brave people have also been subjected to various invasions. The Assyrian king Esarhaddon invaded northern Arabia in the 7th century BC. The Romans once made northern Arabia a province of the Roman Empire. Southern Arabia fell into the hands of the New Persian Kingdom. When Muhammad was born, the king of Abyssinia invaded the south in the 6th century.</p>
<p>The ancient Arabian city of Yemen was originally the most prominent, but it was later replaced by Mecca and Medina. Mecca's location was at the intersection of two major transportation routes – one from Syria to southern Arabia, and the other from Abyssinia to Southeast Asia. In Mecca, there was a temple called the Kaaba, which was the center of Arab religious belief. The tribe that guarded this temple was called the Quraish – descendants of the smartest son of Ishmael. Because of guarding the temple, this tribe specialized in being priests. At the end of the 6th century, the Abyssinians failed to invade Mecca and sweep all of Arabia with the power of Christianity. This was considered a religious blessing for the Arabs.</p>
<p>Arabs claim that Mecca was built by Adam and the Kaaba temple was built by Abraham. Because Ishmael moved to Mecca, the city prospered. There is a well in the city filled with black water, called the Well of Zamzam, which is where the angel communicated with Ishmael's mother.</p>
<p>Medina's location was not important in terms of transportation, but it had natural resources. The people of Medina had always been jealous of Mecca's superior position, so when Muhammad fled to Medina later, the people of the city helped him wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>The ancient Arabs were skilled in literature and enthusiastic about poetry and oratory, much like the Olympic Games of Greece. Tribes would gather once a year. At the gathering, poets would compete to recite poetry. However, they were not very interested in science. Their history was just a series of chronicles. Their astronomy could only distinguish the seasons. They were content with the four things that God had given them – turbans, tents, swords, and poems.</p>
<p>The religious life of the Arabs was quite profound. The ancient Arab religion was the Sabian religion of idol worship, worshiping the sun, moon, and stars. However, there were also various other religious beliefs. Some adhered to the doctrines of their ancestors, some believed in Persian magic, some believed in Judaism, and some even accepted Christianity. Before Muhammad was born, Arab religion was a mixture of monotheism and polytheism – Judaism could not unify the Arabian Peninsula. The work of unifying this religion, Christianity, magic, and idol worship would be left to Muhammad. However, both Christianity and Judaism failed.</p>
<p>Mecca Pilgrimage Scene: Muslim pilgrims travel to Mecca every year, those departing from Africa and southern Asia all take the route through the Red Sea to Jeddah, then transfer to the holy city of Mecca. The picture shows the grand scene of Arabian ships fully loaded with pilgrims sailing into the port of Jeddah.</p>

<h3>The Housing Rent Problem is in a State of Chaos; Urgently Awaiting the Authorities to Promulgate Definite Regulations to Stop Second Landlords from Exploiting Third Tenants</h3>
<p>The issue of converting housing rents from the old legal tender to Central Reserve Bank notes, caused by currency changes, has been under joint discussion by the relevant authorities for some time. All sectors of the city are paying close attention because it greatly affects their own interests. If there is no unified decision, there will always be complex disputes between primary landlords, secondary landlords, and subtenants. However, according to what this newspaper's reporter learned yesterday from well-informed sources, the discussions conducted by the authorities in the two concession areas and the outer areas have achieved satisfactory results. The relevant authorities have notified the banks, real estate departments, real estate companies, and rental agents in their respective jurisdictions that from June onwards, all periodic or non-periodic rents should be converted to Central Reserve Bank notes at 75% of the original amount calculated in the old legal tender. In other words, the original amount of rent will be increased by 50% and then halved to be collected in new currency. Rents before June will still be collected according to the original actual value of the old legal tender. From now on, the prolonged chaotic state of rent collection will be broken, and the rent payment relationship between primary landlords, secondary landlords, and subtenants must take the authorities' principles as the standard.</p>
<p>A Few Owners Charging 66%</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the authorities have made great progress in controlling commodity prices, which has benefited Chinese and foreign citizens. However, the extremely important issue of housing rents has yet to be resolved. Because the authorities have not yet promulgated formal regulations for paying rent in Central Reserve Bank notes converted from the old legal tender, rent disputes are constantly emerging. One or two large real estate companies have decided to collect apartment and house rents at a rate of 66 yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes per 100 yuan of the old legal tender. However, most real estate companies still demand that the rent in the old legal tender be converted and collected in Central Reserve Bank notes without any discount.</p>
<p>Stalemate Awaiting Resolution</p>
<p>Officials from the Asia Development Board, the Japanese Consulate, and the Public Works Department all believe that a quick resolution to this important issue is necessary. However, regulations cannot be promulgated until a thorough investigation of this issue has been conducted from all aspects. At the same time, it is reported that less than half of the tenants in the city have paid their rent for April, May, and June, and the rent for this month goes without saying. Because real estate companies or owners firmly want to convert and collect rent in Central Reserve Bank notes at a one-to-one ratio, most tenants do not agree and are waiting for the promulgation of official regulations. For the past six weeks or so, the owners have stopped sending staff to collect overdue rents and have not sent letters to tenants urging them to pay their rent immediately as agreed. In short, the rent problem is completely in a state of chaos.</p>
<p>Unanimous Opposition to a One-to-One Ratio</p>
<p>Many tenants in the French Concession, such as Sassoon &amp; Co., China Land Company, etc., have already taken the initiative to implement this measure in April. Then some tenants who have already paid rent at a one-to-one ratio plan to demand that the owners return the overpaid rent.</p>
<p>Second Landlords Exploit Third Tenants</p>
<p>What is even more that certain large real estate companies collect rents by converting them to Central Reserve Bank notes at a one-to-one ratio, but the salaries of the staff in their apartments are paid in Central Reserve Bank notes with a discount. As for second landlords exploiting third tenants, it has not subsided, especially in the French Concession, where they arbitrarily charge third tenants extra fees, forcing them to pay or move out. Third tenants appeal to the police authorities, but it is of little effect because the police have little inclination to deal with this matter. As for the Public Concession, the Public Works Department's Subletting Permit Office and Mediation Committee are working hard to normalize the rent situation. Since the implementation of subletting permits, three months have passed, and some good results have been achieved. It is generally believed that it will take the authorities a long time to investigate the entire issue. Unless the authorities promulgate definite regulations on the important issue of housing rents, the disorderly and uncertain state will continue to exist.</p>

<h3>Mei Lanfang Flies to Shanghai, Arriving Here at 4 PM Today</h3>
<p>Master Mei Lanfang, the owner of the Zhui Yu Xuan studio, has been residing in Hong Kong for several years, living a secluded life by the sea, reading and writing. Friends in Shanghai occasionally received news about his life and activities. Since the incident of December last year, due to postal disruptions, letters have been scarce. Those concerned about Mr. Mei's recent situation have been deeply worried, with even rumors of an "overseas Su Dongpo" [referring to a famous poet in exile]. This newspaper, after probing reliable sources, forcefully refuted the falsehoods and repeatedly reported to readers the news that Mr. Mei was about to come to Shanghai. Last night, this newspaper received further confirmation, learning that Mr. Mei is scheduled to fly to Shanghai from Guangzhou today, arriving around 4 PM. It is reported that after arriving here, Mr. Mei intends to stay for an extended period and does not plan to travel elsewhere for the time being.</p>
<h3>Silver and Banking Industries Agree on Methods for Goods as Collateral, Following Regulations, Contracts Are Established With Pledgers, Who Are Fully Responsible for Repaying Principal and Interest</h3>
<p>The temporary joint committee of the silver and banking industry members, in order to prevent the use of goods as collateral to finance speculation and hoarding, has decided to refuse mortgage loans to those outside the industry, non-industry merchants, and for daily necessities. For loans secured by goods that have been approved after review, special methods for mortgage loans have been established. Contracts are established with companies, factories, and firms according to the regulations of the guild, and a guarantee must be filled out. In addition, the loan term is shortened to a maximum of three months, and interest rates are increased by each bank and firm with reference to the market.</p>
<p>Principal and Interest to be Fully Paid Upon Maturity for Redemption</p>
<p>Those applying to banks and firms for loans secured by goods must comply with the following clauses: Regarding the loan term stipulated in the contract, the pledger shall, upon expiration, without waiting for notification from the pledgee, fully pay the principal and interest of the loan and any advances to the pledgee, without delay. If the interest on the loan is not paid on time, the pledgee may add the outstanding interest to the principal and calculate compound interest, and the collateral shall serve as equal security. The pledgee may still notify the pledger to pay the outstanding amount within one week. The pledger's collateral goods shall conform to the stated quality and quantity. If any discrepancies in quality, shortages in quantity, or false information are discovered, the pledger shall be fully liable for compensation.</p>
<p>Pledger Liable for Compensation</p>
<p>The collateral delivered by the pledger shall be wholly owned by the pledger, and no other person shall have any rights. If any disputes arise before the loan and any advances are cleared, causing damage to the pledgee, the pledger shall be fully liable for compensation. The pledger shall insure the goods in the name of the pledgee with an insurance company approved by the pledgee, covering fire insurance. If fire insurance has already been purchased before the pledge, the insurance policy shall be transferred to the pledgee. If the pledgee deems it necessary to add war risk insurance, the pledger shall add it upon notification by the pledgee. All insurance expenses shall be borne by the pledger, and the insurance policy and premium receipt shall be handed over to the pledgee for safekeeping. If the pledger fails to comply with the provisions of this clause, the pledgee has the right to insure on their behalf.</p>
<p>Shortfall in Indemnity to be Immediately Made Up</p>
<p>If the collateral is destroyed or damaged in whole or in part due to any natural disaster or man-made calamity before the loan and interest are cleared, all insurance compensation shall be collected by the pledgee. The pledgee shall use the compensation to offset the principal and interest of the loan and advances. Any surplus shall be returned to the pledger or used to offset any other debts owed by the pledger to the pledgee, at the pledgee's discretion. If there is a shortfall, the pledger shall make it up in full. If the collateral is not insured or the cause of the damage is not the responsibility of the insurance company, or if the insurance company refuses to pay compensation for any reason, or if the compensation is insufficient, the pledger shall, upon notification from the pledgee after the occurrence of the aforementioned destruction or damage, immediately clear the loan and advances in full, without excuses or delays.</p>
<p>Drop in Price Requires Additional Collateral</p>
<p>If the pledgee believes that the price of the collateral has fallen, the pledgee may notify the pledger to immediately repay a portion of the loan or provide additional collateral. The pledger shall bear the cost of any accidental losses such as theft, encroachment, insect bites, rodent damage, rain leaks, water damage, spoilage, mold, or other similar incidents to the collateral stored in the warehouse. If any of these situations occur, the pledger shall, upon notification from the pledgee, repay a portion or all of the loan or provide additional collateral. If the pledgee believes that the location where the collateral is stored is unsafe in the future, the pledgee may notify the pledger to move it to another location at any time. If the pledger delays or refuses to do so, the pledgee may move it on their behalf and pay for the transportation and relocation costs. The pledger shall immediately repay all expenses paid on their behalf.</p>
<p>Pledgee May Dispose of Collateral</p>
<p>In addition, it is stipulated that if any of the following circumstances occur, the loan shall be deemed to have reached maturity, and the pledgee may auction or sell part or all of the collateral: (A) The pledgee discovers the circumstances described in Clause 3; (B) The pledger fails to pay interest or repay a portion or all of the loan or provide additional collateral in accordance with Clauses 2, 6, 7, and 8; (C) The pledger dies or goes bankrupt or declares liquidation or bankruptcy; (D) The debts owed by the pledger to the pledgee outside of the contract cannot be cleared upon maturity; (E) The original guarantor of the pledger dies, goes bankrupt, declares liquidation or bankruptcy, or intends to relieve themselves of the guarantee responsibility midway, or the pledgee believes that another guarantor must be replaced, but the pledger cannot immediately provide a guarantor acceptable to the pledgee. After the pledgee disposes of the collateral to offset the loan and advances in the above circumstances, any surplus shall be returned to the pledger, and any shortfall shall be made up by the pledger in full.</p>
<h3>Chinese and Foreign Groceries Industries Abide by Valuations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Groceries Industry Association, recently ordered by the legal authorities to prepare a plan to suppress speculation and stabilize commodity prices, has reportedly convened relevant industry members and, in accordance with the authorities' intention to suppress speculation and stabilize commodity prices, converted the previous old currency market prices into Central Reserve Certificates (CRC), informing the industry to comply. If commodity prices must rise or fall in the future, they will submit an application to the authorities for approval in advance and then notify the industry to comply.</p>

<h3>Intense Heat and Humidity, Cholera Continues to be Discovered, Thirteen Cases Occurred on Huangpu Bund, Two Deaths Already</h3>
<p>Among the hospitalized patients at the Shanghai Municipal Epidemic Hospital on Yuqiaqing Road, eight cases of true cholera were discovered. One of them, named Dai Abing (39 years old, male, from Shaoxing, residing at No. 560 Huining Road, Jianqiao, Nanshi), has died despite rescue efforts. The family members of the deceased planned to transport the body to the Nanshi Funeral Home for burial. However, the hospital, upon notification from the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department, stated that the bodies of those who died from true cholera were not allowed to be moved out of the hospital to prevent the spread of cholera bacteria. Therefore, the hospital refused. Yesterday, the family members bought a coffin and placed the body inside the hospital. The other seven patients are progressing well and are expected to be saved. In addition to the above eight cases, five more patients have been confirmed by the Shanghai Municipal Council Laboratory as having true cholera.</p>
<p>Zhu Gaoshi, 65 years old, from Shaoxing, fell ill on July 4th and was admitted to the Shanghai Municipal Epidemic Hospital on the 5th, residing at No. 180 Huining Road, Nanba Jianqiao.</p>
<p>Sui Agui, 40 years old, male, from Shaoxing, fell ill on the 5th and was admitted to the hospital on the 6th, residing at No. 6 of the same address.</p>
<p>Zhu Zhengsheng, 32 years old, male, from Shaoxing, fell ill on the 6th and was admitted to the hospital on the same day, residing at No. 10 of the same address.</p>
<p>Wei Afeng, 9 years old, female, from Wuxi, fell ill on the 6th and was admitted to the hospital on the same day, residing at No. 80 Xinlukou, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei.</p>
<p>Huang Shunqing, 22 years old, male, from Ningbo, fell ill on the 6th and was admitted to the hospital on the same day, residing at No. 123 Huangpu Bund Road (i.e., No. 1 Jinjie Street, Xiaodongmen), 2nd floor of Guohua Bank. The last of the above five, Huang Shunqing, died yesterday. According to Huang Shunqing's address, it is located in the International Settlement, connected to the iron gate of the Chinese area. Therefore, the epidemic is gradually encroaching on the concession, which deserves serious attention.</p>
<h3>Central Reserve Bank Extends Time for Exchanging Damaged Banknotes</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank has, due to the prolonged use of the new legal currency issued by the bank, inevitably resulted in damage and destruction. In particular, those intentionally scribbled on or corroded by water are difficult to distinguish between genuine and fake. Therefore, special regulations for exchanging damaged banknotes have been stipulated and announced to the public to facilitate exchanges. It is now known that the bank has recently seen a large number of citizens going to exchange damaged banknotes, and various banks and money exchange shops have raised the exchange rate for damaged banknotes, and various businesses are being overly critical, causing inconvenience to merchants and citizens. In order to crack down on secretly raising the exchange rate and eliminating the trend of refusal to use, the bank has specifically extended the hours for exchanging damaged banknotes at its branches. The morning hours remain from 9:00 to 11:00, and the afternoon hours are extended from 1:00 to 3:00, and damaged banknotes are exchanged as usual.</p>
<h3>Donations for Student Aid Increasing Daily</h3>
<p>The third session of this newspaper's reader-sponsored student aid fund, due to the sharp increase in tuition fees at all levels of schools, although donations are more than in previous sessions, is still insufficient to cope. After repeated appeals by this newspaper, enthusiastic people from all walks of life have responded one after another, proving that kindness is in people's hearts and enthusiasm is touching. This newspaper received a letter from Mr. Zhu Yiyun yesterday, donating 500 yuan for student aid, and encouraging young students to work hard and make achievements in the future, so that they can help future generations. His words are sincere and worthy of emulation. We also received a letter from the colleagues of the Xiafei Road branch of the Asia Bank, donating 500 yuan for student aid, showing their sincerity in accumulating contributions like grains of sand to form a pagoda. This is an initiative for various social groups to benefit the poor, which is no small feat. Yesterday's received student aid donations totaled 1,030 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates, including Zhu Yiyun 500 yuan, colleagues of the Xiafei Road branch of the Asia Bank 500 yuan, Mr. Shen Junnian 10 yuan, and Du Yulin 10 yuan. The previous balance was 43,642.44 yuan, and the total balance is 44,673.44 yuan.</p>

<h3>Protagonist of the "Yu" and "Yin" Incident, Jin Yuzhen, Reports to the Police, Requesting Investigation of Rumor-Mongering to Avoid Damage to Her Reputation</h3>
<p>A woman named Jin Yuzhen, who is over the age of twenty and still unmarried, had a close relationship with a man named Yin. The two had a mutual affection and formed a couple for many years. On May 10th of this year, Jin had an argument with Yin and left home in anger. Yin, deeply in love, repeatedly placed advertisements in the newspaper, asking to meet Jin. Later, through the mediation of friends, the two reconciled, and Jin returned home safely. However, Yin published large advertisements for dozens of consecutive days, and this ordinary family matter attracted widespread attention from all walks of life. People on the streets discussed it, and some opportunists took this opportunity to promote their own businesses, such as inviting Jin to meet at a hotel, selling photos, publishing single-volume novels, and so on. All sorts of things happened, and the outside world was deceived and fooled by them. Ms. Jin believes that this fabricated information is not only harmful to Yin but also related to her own reputation and credibility. In addition to entrusting a lawyer to publish a statement in the newspaper explaining the situation, it is reported that she also reported the matter to the police station in her area yesterday, requesting an investigation to stop the rumors and prevent the public from being deceived.</p>
<h3>The Kidnapping Case of Ye Nanshan, the Hostage Died in the Bandit's Den, Five Kidnappers Have Been Arrested, the Truth Has Been Revealed, and They Are Awaiting Transfer</h3>
<p>Ye Nanshan, a wealthy businessman in the hardware industry from Henan, 66 years old, residing at No. 4, Lane 235, Moore Road, was kidnapped by bandits at 8:00 AM on July 16th last year while Ye was walking on Moore Road. The bandits forced him into a car and disappeared without a trace, demanding a ransom of one million yuan from Ye's family. Ye's wife, Ms. Shen, entrusted her close friend Pan Yaoting to repeatedly negotiate with the bandit representative Wang Bingsheng. As a result, the ransom was settled at 130,000 yuan. However, Ye Nanshan, after being kidnapped, due to his advanced age,</p>
<p>Fell Ill Due to Fright</p>
<p>Died in the bandit's den during the negotiation period. After the bandits received the ransom, they revealed the news of Ye's death and said that the body had been coffined and placed in a deserted field. Ye's family went to retrieve the coffin and re-coffined it at the Shangtian Funeral Home. Tan Jinhai, Sun Wenda, Zhang Kuidong, and Japanese detectives from the Chengdu Road Police Station,</p>
<p>Arrested One After Another</p>
<p>The criminals in this case, Wu Guo (i.e., Wu Xianding) from Ningbo, Tang Zhihe, Zhou Ruiyong, Wang Bingquan from Songjiang, and Huang Yongzhai (i.e., Huang Amao) from Wuxi, were brought to the police station and confessed to being involved in the kidnapping of Ye Nanshan. However, the police were suspicious of the cause of Ye's death after being kidnapped and feared that the bandits had</p>
<p>Intentionally Killed the Hostage</p>
<p>The police reported to the Special Court Inspection Office and were granted permission to open the coffin for inspection. After re-examination, it was found that there were no wounds on the body of the deceased, and he had indeed died of illness. Then the investigation began and learned that the initial initiator of this case was Tang Zhihe. Because Tang was in financial difficulty, he discussed with Wu Guo and Zhou Ruiyong at the Yixing Hotel on Edward Road,</p>
<p>Wanting to Commit Kidnapping</p>
<p>However, there was no fixed target at that time. Unexpectedly, Zhou Ruiyong used his brain, because Zhou was working as a tea servant at the Shanghai Moral Association at No. 981 North Chengdu Road, and Ye Nanshan was a member of the association and was quite wealthy. Zhou then suggested kidnapping Ye to obtain a huge ransom. However, they had no firearms or a place to hide the hostage. After several discussions, Wang Bingsheng joined,</p>
<p>Firearms and Cars</p>
<p>Wang was fully responsible for the hiding place and they went to take pictures near Ye's residence and at the time of the kidnapping, they forced Ye into the car and hid him somewhere in Minhang Duhe. After two months, Wang Bingsheng sent out a message through his brother Wang Bingquan, saying that Ye had died and the ransom had not been received. In fact, the proceeds were probably swallowed up by Wang Bingsheng. Now the truth of the case has been revealed, and they are awaiting transfer.</p>
<h3>Obstetrician's Scandal, the Woman Accuses of Rape, the Man Accuses of Unsuccessful Extortion</h3>
<p>Yu Huizhen, a 28-year-old obstetrician and assistant at the Kemmei Obstetrics Hospital, Second Branch, No. 50 Jules Street, French Concession, comes from a well-to-do family and is still unmarried. In the spring of the 28th year [of the Republic], she was introduced by a friend Huang Genfa to Zhang Suifang from Chongming (39 years old this year, currently residing at No. 34 Renshou Lane, West Axims Road), and the two had a meeting. The two clicked and from then on</p>
<p>Traveled Together</p>
<p>As a matter of routine. In July of last year, Zhang Suifang invited Jin Huizhen to the home of his friend Kong Zhang at No. 7 Ladu New Village, Ladu Road, to eat the Seventh Month New Year's meal. He persuaded Jin to drink alcohol, but Ms. Jin was not good at drinking. After repeated urging, she became very drunk and was helped into Kong's pavilion to sleep temporarily. Due to the strong effects of the alcohol, she did not wake up all night. When Ms. Jin woke up the next morning, she found that Zhang Suifang</p>
<p>Slept in the Same Bed</p>
<p>Her chastity had been violated. At that time, Ms. Jin was ashamed and angry and questioned Zhang. Zhang told her not to publicize it and promised to marry her. Ms. Jin, because the deed was done and Zhang had promised to marry her, endured and did not publicize it. Later, she repeatedly urged Zhang to get married, but Zhang initially delayed with sweet words, and then treated her like a stranger, and said that he already had a wife and could only live together. Ms. Jin felt that Zhang was ungrateful and recently hired a lawyer to file a</p>
<p>Rape Complaint</p>
<p>Against Zhang with the authorities. During yesterday's summons, after the plaintiff stated the previous situation, the defendant Zhang Suifang said, I was introduced to the plaintiff Jin Huizhen by Huang Genfa. Once I invited Ms. Jin to dinner, but Jin thought I shouldn't have invited her to eat a five-cent-a-plate meal, which was a bit stingy, and she didn't want to marry me because she thought I was poor. So the person had to hire another matchmaker and marry Ms. Song. She got married on the third day of November last year. At that time, Jin sent a gift of four yuan in the name of Jin Xiuying</p>
<p>To Attend the Wedding</p>
<p>There is proof of the small gift. She once asked someone to ask me to live together, otherwise she would ask me to pay 7,000 yuan to her</p>
<p>To Set Up an Obstetric Hospital</p>
<p>This time, the extortion was unsuccessful, and the case was reported falsely. The person never persuaded her to drink alcohol, and there was no rape. Please investigate. The judge said that the two parties had different views and ordered a postponement for investigation and re-examination.</p>
<h3>Safe Deposit Boxes at the Bank of Communications to Be Opened</h3>
<p>All safe deposit boxes at the Bank of Communications that have not been opened by customers will be opened on the 20th of this month. After opening, the customers will lose the right to move the items stored in the boxes. In other words, it will be extremely difficult for the original owners to recover the original items. After the boxes are opened, all items will be transferred to the Finance Department of the Japanese Army, and the safe deposit boxes will be repaired, their numbers will be changed, and they will be used for other purposes. Therefore, before this opening takes place, the bank sincerely hopes that customers will open their boxes voluntarily so that the original items can be returned to their original owners. However, the person in charge of the bank said that the bank may hold a withdrawal on the 20th and not take into account the opening of the safe deposit boxes, so as to give customers the opportunity to extend the time. However, this depends on the attitude of the Finance Department of the Japanese Army. Otherwise, even if the bank is busy with withdrawals when the Finance Department of the Japanese Army urges, it will still open the boxes.</p>

<h3>On the Authenticity of "Great Tang Treasure Notes" - Letter from Lawyer Sun Zuji</h3>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor of Shen Bao,</p>
<p>I am writing in response to an article in your esteemed publication on the fourth of this month regarding the exhibition of banknotes from various dynasties. It mentioned that the collection was comprehensive, dating back to the Great Tang Dynasty, including "Great Tang Treasure Notes, One String" issued during the Yongwei era, and "Great Tang Convenient People's Real Notes, One Hundred Strings," said to have been issued during the Tianyou era. Also, regarding the Song Dynasty, it mentioned "Great Song Universal Treasure Notes, One Hundred Strings," said to have been issued during the Jianlong era of Emperor Taizu of Song. Having read this, I was greatly surprised and eager to see these items firsthand. I immediately went to the Youth Association, purchased a ticket, and entered the exhibition. However, the so-called Tang and Song "real notes" were only displayed as photographs hung high up, making them blurry and impossible to discern. There were no actual objects on display. I was very disappointed. I then went to the association's office in room 320 to inquire about the matter. According to the staff, when the association initially collected items from various sources, someone claimed to have Tang and Song treasure notes available for display. However, as the exhibition opened, the actual objects had not been delivered, which they deeply regretted. I could only silently retreat and consult our national history. In the mid-Tang Dynasty, there was only the system of "flying money," equivalent to today's drafts. The Song Dynasty only had items known as "Jiaozi," "Huizi," and "Guanzi." Neither the Tang nor Song dynasties issued anything called "treasure notes." "Flying money" had already disappeared by the late Tang and Five Dynasties periods. Even Jiaozi, Huizi, and Guanzi are rarely found in collections, whether at home or abroad. In 1936, Chen Rentao spent five thousand yuan to acquire a Southern Song "Traveling Treasury Huizi" banknote printing plate, which the academic community hailed as an extraordinary find. As for the so-called Tang and Song treasure notes, whether in the Old Book of Tang, the New Book of Tang, or the Tang Huiyao, Tongdian, or Xu Tongdian, there is no record of such items. Neither is there any mention of them in catalogues of antiquities. Therefore, I believe that the exhibitor in question definitely does not possess authentic Tang and Song treasure notes. Even if they do exist, they are undoubtedly forgeries. Yesterday, I consulted my esteemed friend Zhong Tie, who has studied coinage for thirty years, and he also asserted that there were no such actual notes. As this matter concerns academic history, I fear that later generations might misunderstand and spread false information. I dare to express my views and submit them to you, hoping that your esteemed publication will publish this letter to clarify the truth. I would be most grateful.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h3>Public Bonds Slightly Compensated</h3>
<p>Although the trend in the unofficial market for public bonds was volatile yesterday, the situation was relatively stable. Large bullish investors remained unmoved, while there were still many short sellers. Since large amounts of bonds were not being released, the short sellers could not wait any longer and slightly increased their buying to cover their positions. As a result, market prices rebounded and appeared more stable. However, the number of transactions continued to decrease. The golden age of the past has already become history. Currently, due to restrictions on speculation, floating capital has nowhere to go, leading to a resurgence of new industries and factories. Public bonds, as an investment product, may not always remain dormant. However, they are only temporarily hibernating. Trading was very light yesterday. As a result, Type A and E bonds did not change, Type B bonds rose slightly by two cents, and Type C and D bonds rose by one cent and four cents, respectively. The total transaction volume was only about seven or eight hundred thousand yuan. A brief table is provided below.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Hold Firm. Department Store Stocks Stand Out.</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market conditions for Chinese stocks were stagnant. Department store stocks were firm, industrial stocks were mixed, textile stocks were stable, and new pharmaceutical stocks were slightly weak. Newly listed Shanghai Cotton stocks were stable. Although there were sellers, the absorption capacity of investors remained strong. Detailed stock prices are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Gold Jewelry Prices Unchanged. Silver Continues to Decline.</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the retail price of gold jewelry at Da Xin and other gold shops remained at 2,400 yuan per tael, unchanged (with a reduction of 300 yuan for purchases). The inter-dealer trading price was 2,160 to 2,170 yuan per tael, up only ten or twenty yuan. The trend of the day was stable. The price of jewelry silver continued to decline, with the listed price also falling by one yuan to 17 yuan. The inter-dealer trading price had fallen to 13 yuan with sellers, and the buying price was 12.78 yuan.</p>
<h3>Overnight Interest Rate at 1.6 Cents. Japanese Military Scrip Rebounds.</h3>
<p>The discount rate for newly issued bills remained stable. The Money Dealers Association's overnight interest rate was 1.6 cents. Japanese military scrip rebounded due to certain settlements, resulting in demand exceeding supply. The inter-dealer trading price had rebounded to 5.535 yuan. The buying price offered by Qianzhuang (money shops) to Yinhang (banks) had also rebounded to 5.597 yuan and 5.52 yuan, up three or four cents.</p>
<h3>Feng Yuzhuang Joins the Money Treasury</h3>
<p>The joint reserve committee of the banking industry in this city sent a circular to various banks and Qianzhuang (money shops) yesterday, stating that the Money Industry Reserve Treasury had announced that Feng Yuzhuang had joined the treasury as a member on the 3rd of this month. Therefore, starting from July 10th, various banks and Qianzhuang (money shops) that receive payment instruments from Feng Yuzhuang should entrust the association to collect payment, and handle it in the same manner as other member Qianzhuang (money shops). Furthermore, Maichang Trust Company of this city has recently opened an account with the Joint Reserve Committee of the Banking Industry and has been assigned exchange number 257.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Fluctuates. Range Has Narrowed.</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market continued to rise, but the range of fluctuations had narrowed. Twelve-pound Longtou (Dragon Head) fine cloth opened at 202 yuan, rose to 207 yuan, and closed at 205 yuan. Mid-range Caiqiu (Colorful Ball) and Feiyu (Flying Fish) cloth each rose by three or four yuan. The closing price of Sijunzi (Four Gentlemen) serge was 7.83 yuan. Factory cloth followed suit, with sixteen-pound Diqiu (Earth) coarse cloth at 196 yuan, Feihong (Flying Goose) at 194 yuan, twelve-pound Diqiu (Earth) fine cloth at 177 yuan, and Mulan bleached cloth at 180 yuan, with transactions occurring. Taohua (Peach Blossom) Ladies' poplin opened at 283 yuan and closed at 288 yuan.</p>
<h3>Níróng (Woolen Fabric) Speculators Worry.</h3>
<p>The woolen fabric market remained stable, but transactions remained quiet. Retail prices continued to decrease, due to investigations. Industry players generally do not focus on trading and adopt a non-aggressive trading approach. However, speculators holding woolen fabric are increasingly worried. If they do not sell, they fear stricter inspections and more difficult transportation. If they try to sell, even at reduced prices, no one is interested. This illustrates their difficult situation.</p>
<h3>High Metal Prices Affect Actual Sales of Various Goods.</h3>
<p>The prices of various metal products were resolved by the industry association yesterday, with the standards generally higher than previous market prices, with no declines. However, the metal market is currently extremely quiet, and actual sales of various goods have decreased sharply. It is learned that industry players' sentiment is gradually softening and showing signs of uncertainty. Therefore, the extent of the metal market's stagnation is evident. The prices of various goods in yesterday's market are recorded below, such as 2,000-pound black iron billets at 16,000 yuan per ton, self-made iron sheets at 22,000 yuan per ton, 18- to 20-gauge plain white iron at 30,000 yuan per ton, 26- to 28-gauge colored iron at 32,000 yuan, 2- to 7-gauge new steel plates at 20,000 yuan per ton, 1-point to thick steel plates at 18,000 yuan per ton, and Lao Xiong (Old Bear) steel and Shuang Ma (Double Horse) steel each selling for 800 yuan per case. Benyuan (Original Source) nails sell for 700 yuan per barrel, four-point colored nails for 1,200 yuan per barrel, five-point nails for 1,100 yuan, six-point nails for 1,000 yuan, three-point sesame nails for 1,400 yuan per case, four-point nails for 1,300 yuan per case, five-point nails for 1,200 yuan per case, six-point nails for 1,100 yuan per case, and three-point Western nails for 2,000 yuan per case (all prices are based on Central Reserve Bank currency).</p>
<h3>Wide Price Discrepancies for Coarse Grains</h3>
<p>The coarse grains market remained quiet yesterday, with few transactions. The prices varied widely between supply and demand, making transactions difficult. Only a total of 500 pieces of Hankou soybean cake were offered at a price of 58.5 yuan, and the situation was stable.</p>
<p>According to wholesale statistics, the city's edible oil consumption for June was 19,769 Dan.</p>
<h3>Second-Grade Dates Sell Well. Prices Trend Upward.</h3>
<p>Among black dates, the most common is the second-grade date. Recently, sales of lower-grade dates have been brisk, resulting in daily transactions and gradual price increases. This trend of buying low and selling high is a recent phenomenon. Two batches of goods were offered yesterday, with the initial increase exceeding ten yuan, followed by another five yuan. This shows that the demand side is focusing on lower-quality goods to meet consumer demand, which is a necessary strategy in a price-restricted environment.</p>
<h3>Sugar Stock Trading Remains Light. Market Prices Continue to Decline.</h3>
<p>Trading in sugar stock units at the Sugar Industry Cooperative Business Office remained sluggish yesterday, and prices continued to decline. Coarse sugar stock initially fell one yuan, opening at 318 yuan, and then slightly recovered, closing at 318 yuan. There were 600 bags traded. Red sugar stock lacked transactions due to price competition.</p>
<h3>Dried Squid in Short Supply. Market Tightens.</h3>
<p>Due to lively sales, dried squid continues to rise in price. Additionally, due to scarce supply and limited inventory, the trend remains tight and persistent. Yesterday, Ningbo goods sold for 450 yuan, Zhoushan goods for 600 yuan, and Yantai goods for 600 yuan.</p>
<h3>Soap and Matches Are Well Stocked by Speculators.</h3>
<p>Daily goods trade remains quiet. In the soap market, there are two types of Gu Ben Soap: Xujiahui and Xiaoshadu. Currently, sales have generally shifted to the Xuhui goods, resulting in quiet trade in Xiaoshadu products and low prices. Furthermore, due to price restrictions, Xiang Mao Pi soap retail sales have long ceased, resulting in a narrow sales channel. The previous price increase was due to general speculation. Regarding matches, all factory and warehouse goods are purchased by the Match Allocation Group and distributed to the industry for sale. This has resulted in a large volume of goods being allocated recently. However, the difficulty of transporting goods purchased from the market has deterred speculators.</p>

<h3>Strenuous Effort is Life</h3>
<p>— Gao Jiaji</p>
<p>Once, a young man wrote a letter to an elder, asking him to find "an easy position" for him. The elder replied: "You cannot be an editor; don't become a lawyer; don't think of being a tax collector; give up all ships, stores, and merchandise; don't be a farmer, nor a machinist; don't be a soldier, nor a sailor; don't work; don't study; don't think. Because none of these things are easy. Child, you have come into a world of hard labor! In this world, I know only one easy position, and that is the grave."</p>
<p>If we knew early on that there is no "easy position" in any occupation in life, it would save us a lot of trouble and disappointment. Life is a battle, not an armchair; life is a long, hard struggle, not a carnival; life is a challenge to your talents, not a sleeping pill.</p>
<p>Strenuous effort is life! (Abridged translation from Hoffman's original work)</p>
<p>Sketch</p>
<h3>Hat</h3>
<p>— Wang Hemi</p>
<p>On sunny mornings, an old man named Zhou with many children always sat at the entrance of the house, using grass to weave toy dragonflies, frogs, and other things. He didn't talk much, weaving with his hands, and sometimes he would look up and smile at the excited children.</p>
<p>Originally, it was admirable enough that an elderly person continued to live by his own strength, but if you saw his calm, composed attitude and those eyes that faintly held the light of wisdom, you would have even more profound respect for him.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, he stopped coming, and the children were a little lonely.</p>
<p>One day, I was walking down a quiet, long road, and suddenly, I saw a familiar back: oh, that lovely hair, the dark brown, ancient art box on his back, the steady gait: yes, it was the old man... I greeted him and asked him why he hadn't visited us in so long. He was surprised by my rather abrupt and even somewhat ridiculous enthusiasm, but immediately I found a touching, kind old man's smile at the corner of his mouth. He told me that his home was nearby and invited me to sit for a while.</p>
<p>It was a one-story tile house, with dim light and extremely simple furniture.</p>
<p>"Haha," he said, "this can be considered stark poverty, but pure poverty is lovely..."</p>
<p>He told me that he had a son in a distant place; he himself used to be a teacher, and this craft was something he had only learned a year ago; this really surprised me. He said a lot, and was very different from his usual self. I remained silent, thinking, an old man learns a craft to support himself, maintaining the courage to live, it couldn't help but move people!</p>
<p>Finally, he said to me, "Yes, I am starkly poor, but my son will be able to receive an inheritance from me in the future—a clean surname. In the future, he can proudly tell people that his father was an upright person who never made any dirty money and still lived by his own strength in his old age... I often say a sentence: 'We should take off the hat that warms us but obscures our vision.'..."</p>
<p>As I left his house, I thought, he was not only giving his son a valuable inheritance, but also giving me a valuable gift. I felt that I had to leave an inheritance for my children - a clean surname. Dear reader, this is the gift I am passing on to you:</p>
<p>We must take off the hat that warms us</p>
<p>But obscures our vision."</p>
<p>Reflections</p>
<h3>The Price of Work</h3>
<p>— An Qieni</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Lin Bao's article "Gardener" in the "Free Talk" section of the June 11th issue, I feel I have something to say.</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Bao told us that once he walked past a dilapidated garden and saw two gardeners working diligently. A few months later, he walked past the same place again and it was blooming with life. Therefore, Mr. Lin Bao felt that although the two gardeners worked hard and were poorly paid, their work was not meaningless.</p>
<p>Perhaps their work is not meaningless, perhaps this spirit of serving humanity is worth imitating by the gardeners in our garden of life, but it is best not to be too far from reality. In any case, if the distribution of rewards is not equal to the amount of work, if the work outweighs the reward, it is always one of the serious ills of this society. We should not ignore the fact that the wealth of the rich is merely the accumulation of the labor of most people whose work outweighs the reward.</p>
<p>I believe that Mr. Lin Bao's intention in asking everyone to emulate the spirit of service of the two gardeners is absolutely well-intentioned, and perhaps it is an stimulant for those who are excessively tired of work, but could it also unintentionally become a kind of anesthetic - an anesthetic that neutralizes the resentment of those who are overworked with "empty words of comfort"? If the gardener were to starve to death on the barren ground of the garden before the fruit was born, wouldn't that be a cruel irony?</p>
<p>I believe that if the work in the world can be called work, and is not an activity of hoarding, it is always somewhat meaningful and beneficial to everyone. Not seeking fame is also a good attitude to life; however, the reward must be equal to - at least close to - the value of the work. This is a law that must be observed. Although this seems to have a bit of an individualistic color, it should not be a shameful thing to be unwilling to treat yourself unfairly and to fight for your own legitimate interests.</p>
<p>"First, to survive, second, to have enough to eat and wear, and third, to develop. Whoever hinders this future, whether it is ancient or modern, human or ghostly, whether it is the Three Tombs and Five Canons, the Hundred Song and Ten Yuan Dynasties, the Celestial Sphere Chart, the Golden Man and Jade Buddha, the ancestral pills and powders, or the secret recipes, all must be overthrown." (Lu Xun's words) Yes, "first, to survive, second, to have enough to eat and wear," even the term "self-sacrifice" is not acceptable. Anything that hinders this small requirement of ours must be overthrown, cruelly overthrown.</p>
<p>Human Sentiment</p>
<h3>The Encounter of a "Monkey King" - How Can He Not Complain When He Suffers Today's Hardship</h3>
<p>— Feng Maniu</p>
<p>Before Mr. Lin became the "Monkey King", when he received a diploma in economics, he was full of great ambitions, but it seemed that fate arranged for him to be a "Monkey King". He tried several times to get into the bank, but he didn't have a guarantor and had to start as a trainee, which he didn't like. There were many layoffs and few hires, and he didn't have relatives to climb. So, Mr. Lin was idle for a few months, but fortunately "luck" was still good. Through an introduction, he became the "Monkey King"—a small alley school with two or three hundred small "monkeys" crammed into it, but the sign "Still Vacant" was always hanging at the door. Mr. Lin was in charge of the senior grades, a combined fifth and sixth grade system. He was a homeroom teacher, but Mr. Lin was also assigned to write all the school's announcements and so on. It seemed like he was also a secretary, but he wasn't, because it didn't seem like the salary included that, it was just the number of teaching hours—a month of work added up to less than a hundred, about ninety-five yuan.</p>
<p>However, for the sake of the ninety-five yuan, Mr. Lin sold his entire day like a "bonded laborer." At 8 o'clock in the morning, he went from his home to the school and began to wield chalk and open his mouth in front of the blackboard. At this time, Mr. Lin really seemed "knowledgeable and talented." He not only taught the main subjects such as English history and geography and nature, but Mr. Lin could also handle manual labor, art, and music. However, Mr. Lin often felt the difficulty of teaching. A depiction of an apple drawn on the blackboard made even himself feel "strangely strange," and as for music, Mr. Lin lacked a "golden voice" and could only barely play a few notes on the accordion, which made him feel a headache in class. But, after class, he should be able to rest, right? But no, he had to do some "obligations" for the principal, copying mimeographs and writing announcements. Then, there should be some "reward," such as a rich lunch, but no, it was already contracted in advance "no lunch is provided." Mr. Lin had no choice but to "bring his own." Eating out was too expensive, so he brought some leftover cold rice and some dried side dishes, asked the school's kitchen steward to heat it up, ate a rough meal, and started the afternoon's work again, going home until four or five o'clock. When he got home, he corrected papers and graded homework, making himself dizzy. From morning until bedtime, Mr. Lin seemed to be a slave to this private elementary school.</p>
<p>Mr. Lin has also thought about breaking away from this "slavery" life. He couldn't get enough to eat and couldn't starve to death, and the salary was so low. After paying the rent, he had to buy provisions and still had to borrow money. But Mr. Lin was also like a canary, panicking and getting lost in the cage, unable to make a living, so he had to put it off day by day. Recently, the June salary was changed to a reserve currency, which was halved, but the teachers jointly asked for a raise, and the principal generously agreed, and Mr. Lin's salary became sixty-five yuan, which was slightly more than before when converted, even though the tram fares had increased at the same time!</p>
<p>But unfortunately, it was a "at the same time" - "I heard" that in the next semester, the principal of this humble school "did not intend to operate" it and transferred it to the principal of a certain middle school, because the tuition was increased, there were fewer students, and the expenses were greater than before. Although he himself did not lose money, the shrewd principal who loved to make money was not satisfied and felt that this "business" had little profit and was exhausting. He decided to sell it, and "making money like" and so on could be immediately turned into cash. For the principal, this was another good way to "revitalize" his finances.</p>
<p>Mr. Lin didn't pay attention to this news at first. Later, a week before the start of the summer vacation, the principal treated him to a meal. The principal made a moving speech, first thanking him and then complaining. As a result, this "I heard" was confirmed: in the next semester, it would be transferred to Mr. ×××, the principal of a certain middle school.</p>
<p>Tables, benches, blackboards, and students "had to be transferred," but there was no mention of the teachers. However, some people who knew the principal got tenure, while Mr. Lin, who didn't know him and couldn't "iron his way in," and the new principal didn't ask about Mr. Lin, was "fired."</p>
<p>"No one accepted me," Mr. Lin said with a wry smile. Mr. Lin is now "waiting to be hired" in a small pavilion that is like a furnace!</p>
<h3>Maxims</h3>
<p>— Xiao Zi</p>
<p>He who can not be a slave to his passions is a hero. Gori Qing</p>
<p>Machines are man's slaves, man is not the slave of machines. Farini</p>
<p>Modern people often cry out for leisure. One day those long-suffering gods will punish them by giving them leisure. Andersen</p>
<p>Life</p>
<h3>Self-Respect and Pride</h3>
<p>— Huang Wenjin</p>
<p>I feel that everyone should have self-respect—respect for one's own personality, respect for one's own thoughts, actions, and responsibilities.</p>
<p>On the road to success, those without self-respect will never leave behind their difficult footprints. Did you know that Macaulay was very self-possessed in his childhood? At the age of seven, he began writing a "World History" with lofty ambitions. Think about it, who would not laugh at this child's idea of handling this difficult task with his immature mind? However, he later became a brilliant figure in the British literary world.</p>
<p>However, self-respect is not arrogance, much less stubborn conceit. Because arrogance despises everything, considering everyone else to be inferior to oneself, and thus becoming conceited. After a young person becomes arrogant, he will refuse to learn humbly and will only be buried in his own arrogance.</p>
<h3>Amphibious Tank</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiao</p>
<p>The weakness of a tank’s track system, which uses cog-wheels, is its slow speed, though its strength lies in its ability to travel over rugged terrain. Now, a new type of amphibious tank has been invented, also known as an all-terrain tank. It can traverse mountainous regions as well as flat roads because, in addition to the cog-wheel tracks, it also has tire wheels. When traveling on uneven roads, the tire wheels are lifted, and when on flat ground, they are lowered, offering unparalleled convenience. Recent war reports from Europe and Africa frequently mention tank battles; it is unknown whether this type of tank has appeared in the war efforts there.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms</h3>
<p>— Xiang Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(Six) A Snap of the Fingers</p>
<p>Wei Cheng was reading, or rather, contemplating, in the Chen’s residence. Guo Fang and Guo Qi’s environment was much better. First, the residence was quiet amidst the bustling city. Second, the kind grandmother and the steady maid surpassed my family in many ways... Mrs. Chen, the elder, came to entertain him after finishing her meal. One of her opening lines was quite stimulating: "Young Master Ye, you could also marry a new young mistress now." Wei Cheng merely smiled. Then he looked for his long gown, preparing to return, but Mrs. Chen wouldn't let him leave, saying, "Just stay here and wait for them to come back. They should be back in a day or two." Wei Cheng thought that this was improper in terms of both propriety and brilliance. Mrs. Chen insisted on him staying until he at least had some watermelon before leaving. Wei Cheng couldn't refuse, so he ate the watermelon. The watermelon was indeed very sweet, and the sweetness reminded him that Mrs. Chen was skilled at making Su candy, but unfortunately, it wasn't the right season to eat Su candy.</p>
<p>Wei Cheng left a note on the table, roughly saying: "I came, but you weren't back, which is disappointing. You should be back any day now, please find a way to notify me within twenty-four hours." After putting down the pen, he saw a significant flaw in the note. He couldn't tear up the note and rewrite it in front of Mrs. Chen. What was the flaw? It turned out that the note only mentioned Guo Fang's name and not Guo Qi's. The note also only used "you" instead of "you all," which would make Guo Qi angry. Helpless, he had to pick up the pen again and add the character "Qi" next to the character "Fang," and add the character "all" next to "you," awkwardly handing it to the old maid, saying, "Once your young master and young mistress return, give this to them."</p>
<p>He repeatedly thanked Mrs. Chen, and Mrs. Chen repeatedly chanted "Amitabha," seeing him all the way to the door. He followed the same route back to Shi De Tang. When he arrived home, the sun hadn't completely set. Cui Zhen and Second Mrs. Ye, all wanted to inquire about the situation from Wei Cheng. Wei Cheng said, "Neither of the siblings were home, but Mrs. Chen warmly invited me to a meal." He recounted the dishes he had eaten to his aunt, even making Second Mrs. Ye somewhat uneasy. Cui Zhen said, "This is common. Miss Chen said she might or might not return, I wonder how her health is." (123)</p>
