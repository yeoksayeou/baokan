<p>社評</p>
<h3>對於長期戰應有之認識與準備</h3>
<p>現在進行中的世界大戰，是被逼着走向「長期戰」的前途。因爲戰爭一發動了之後，誠如德國著名的大戰略家克勞塞維支氏所說：「它將不是跟隨戰爭發動者的意志走，而要跟隨戰爭本身的規律走了！」現在的戰爭，自經英美醞釀促成之後，已經一天一天的踏上長期戰的途徑了。而且，美國和牠們的一個體系又誇示着魔術般的數字，有意驅使英·蘇·重慶等去進行反軸心的戰爭，以圖在大家筋疲力盡的時候，好讓美國獨霸世界，所以有意地使戰爭進入長期戰。不過，從東亞國家的立塲，應該怎樣來觀察所謂長期戰的意義呢？最近日本大本營陸軍報道部長谷荻那華雄大佐的「長期戰的新面目」（譯文見今日本報）一文，都値得我們重視。</p>
<p>谷荻部長很坦白地指出當前戰局與長期戰的趨勢，和日本對於「明日之決戰」的決意，他說「今後爲要澈底使英美屈服，我軍將進攻印度，澳洲及阿拉斯加等地，在這中間，大小決戰不知凡幾，或則間隔，或則連續而行，所以今天的長期戰，可說是長期戰與短期戰的複合體」。他更明白的指示出，長期戰對軸心國是有利的，他指出「在最近的將來，美英倘不能走向決定性的勝利，國內外的情勢，就要陷入困窘的狀態，無論如何，今明年中，美英非出發全部兵力，予軸心國以致命的打擊不可。也就是說，長期戰不過是一句空話，他們心裏還是希望速戰速決的。」那麽，從東亞國家和民族的利益着眼，在這樣意義的長期戰中，應該有怎樣的準備呢？谷荻部長說得明白，因爲這次的戰爭是「大小決戰在長期間內一直持續着的一個長期戰。在邋動比賽上說，這不是賽跑，而是彰碍物響跑。如果是賽跑的話，開步時不出力跑也行的，但障碍物賽跑，却非開頭就出力不可！」所以日本爲了最後的勝利，不僅必須準備好在戰爭最後終結中的必勝條件：而且因爲這個最後的決勝，同時又是「在長期間內一直持續着的」「大小決戰」的勝利的積累，所以，又必須馬上集中國內佔領區，和盟邦的一切力量，準備在長期戰期間內的大小決戰中獲得勝利。</p>
<p>我們中國就是處在這樣的長期戰的時代，和處在這樣的戰爭環境與戰略要求的裏面，根據中日在大東亞戰爭中協力的任務，就也必需如這次大戰所賦予日本及其國民的任務那樣，賦予中國及其人民以新的任務。</p>

<h3>長期戰的新面目　大本營陸軍報道部長　谷荻那華雄大佐　譯自十二月九日「大阪新聞」</h3>
<p>八日午後六時，東京日比谷公會堂舉行大東亞戰爭一周年紀念美英擊滅大演講會，大本營陸軍報道部長谷荻那華雄大佐以「長期戰的新面目」爲題，對當前戰局作了詳盡的詮釋。谷荻部長說：「今後爲要澈底使美英屈服，我軍將進攻印度，澳洲及阿拉斯加等地，在這中間，大小次戰不知凡幾，或則間隔，或則連續而行，所以今天的長期戰，可說是長期戰與短期戰的複合體。但是，在明天的準備和好幾年以後的準備，其間有了矛盾的塲合，我們就該先注重明天的準備，而予以急速的處置。」由此可見當前戰局是有極嚴重的意義的。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭勃發之後，敵美英不堪一擊，相繼敗去，在東亞方面，早已是不存一片基地，不賸一個兵卒了。由於屢次的敗北，美國朝野意氣都非常銷沉，關於戰爭指導的想法，最初不免是受動的消極的。經過相當時日，才逐漸恢復了冷靜的頭腦，開始建立了自主的方策。就是說，把戰爭的目的解作對民主主義之防衛，一方面鞭韃重慶，另一方面鼓舞蘇聯，使之牽制住日本及德義，消耗軸心國的兵力，把戰爭變成長期持久性的戰爭。在這中間，對別國要求極度的犧牲，而自己呢，則化爲民主國家的兵工廠，專門負担後方兵站的任務，與其說借貸，寗可說是出賣兵器，從中取得巨額利潤，即使在戰後，也將繼續這樣的搾取，使全世界在物質上都成爲美國的附庸。因此在作戰計劃方面，牠是企圖在一九四四年以前，將陸·海·空軍大大地擴張，乘軸心國疲於久戰之際，大舉反攻，一舉而獲得最後的勝利。至於重慶及蘇聯，一向以飛機潛艇在進行游擊戰的，他們就盡力地予以支持。</p>
<p>美國希望英蘇蔣同歸于盡</p>
<p>到最後的瞬問，只有美國一國是存在的。日，德，義自不用說，就是英，蘇，蔣，美國也都希望他們死盡滅絕。這就是說，美國在第一次世界大戰中採取的老獪的詭計，又想如法泡製一次了。但是，隨着戰爭的進展，他們不得不開始覺悟：這條路是走不通的。至其理由，請申述如下：</p>
<p>美國爲要保衛民主主義，不得不和民主主義最大的敵人之蘇聯携手，這是一個大矛盾。其次，名爲民主國家，而實際則將總統的獨裁權加以强化，這也是非常滑稽的。近來羅斯福和邱吉爾很起勁地在製作大西洋　章，宣說着自由之必須尊重，但是舌苔還沒有乾，他們又在强姦印度人的意志，抑壓他們的獨立了。在伊蘭，伊拉克，叙里亞，馬特加斯加，最近又在北菲，對一切弱小國家，弱小民族，他們都行若無事地去進行着不法侵略。揭開了假面的强盜，大言不慚地在說：「我是你們的友人」。特別是，蘇聯以犧牲爲代價，在要求軍需品的補給以及第二戰錢的開闢，但是美英却由衷地憎厭這樣的要求。這，微之於美蘇協定以及英蘇協定而益信。事實上，現在紳蘇戰綫上所用的兵器，美國製造的是非常之少的，即使有一些，也都是非常舊式的東西。還有，美英對於開闢第二戰綫之無誠意，亦早經史太林申說在前了。</p>
<p>美國對重慶的工作</p>
<p>蘇聯方面，自本年夏季德軍開始了攻勢以來，戰力消耗殆盡，現在差不多已陷於絕境了。重慶呢，惡性通貨膨脹啦，物資缺乏啦，……鬧得不亦樂乎，也在急待美英的救濟。重慶也罷，美央也罷，忚們都是互相利用的，因此，就引起了利害衝突以及離反的傾向。美國派了一部分飛機到中國來，那是事實，但徵之飛襲香港的美空軍俘虜之言，他們對中國的作戰生活是非常不滿的；另一方面，因爲轟炸的結果，無辜的中國人民直接間接受到許多損害，重慶方面對他們也發出了種種不滿之聲。</p>
<p>戰爭目的的矛盾，民心的動搖，弱小國家的危懼，德蘇戰爭的沉悶，蘇聯和重慶方面的離反傾向，……這些，都是叫美國頭痛的問題。加之，又當面着軸心國，特別是日本的强軔的國力，這樣，美國就不得不將牠的戰爭指導方策加以變更了。也就是說，以前一直作爲民主國家的兵工廠之美國，不得不站到作戰的第一綫上來了。羅斯福以前說過，美國靑年決不至於被派到別國作戰，但是現在，數十萬靑年被派出了，他們每日都有死傷，比當局發表的數目多到百倍千倍以上的靑年，或則沉入海底，或則在沙漠上化爲白骨。</p>
<p>美國在對日反攻之際，特別注重「時」與「物」這兩個因素，詳情旣如上述；然則他們果眞能够勝利麽？不，決不可能的。日本大東亞共榮圈的建設，進行得非常順利，而德義在歐洲方面，也繼續發揮着威力。這就是決戰時勝利誰屬的保證。</p>
<p>長期戰對軸心國是有利的</p>
<p>所以，戰爭愈延長，愈能獲利的國家，結果還楚軸心國方面。單就船舶問題來說，美國月產五十萬噸，英國十萬噸，共計只有六十萬噸左右，而每月被軸心國潛艇炸沉的倒有七八十萬噸，多的時候甚至突破百萬噸的記錄。假使繼續這樣下去的話，美英即使作困獸之猶鬥，鬥勁兒也不會有多久了。</p>
<p>我們不妨進一步來分析一下：像英國的塲合，船舶保持量至少得維持約七百萬噸，否則，補給就非常困難。在美國的塲台，無論牠的生產力多發達，但是總有限度的。尤其軍需工業上必不可缺的許多「熱帶資源」，例如橡皮啦，錫啦，鎢金啦，……都非常缺乏，此外，配給的不圓滑，熟練工的不足，以及屢次敗戰中耗去兵力的補充困難等等，在在都使美國焦急。所以，在最近的將來，美英倘不能走向決定性的勝利，國內外的情勢就要陷入困窘的狀態。無論如何，今明年中。美英非出動全部兵力，予軸心國以致命打擊不可。也就是說，長期戰不過一句空話，他們心裏還是希望速戰速決的。</p>
<p>加達卡那兒之重要性</p>
<p>這樣，美國八月上旬起在南太平洋方面，十一月上旬起在西菲方面，東西兩方面都開始了反擊作戰。南太平洋方面，重點是在所羅門羣島的加達卡那兒島上。</p>
<p>加達卡那兒島離東京約二千七百海里之遙，面積縱約十里，橫約四十里，在在在太平洋中簡直是滄海一粟。該島人烟稀薄，大部分都是峻嶮的山岳地帶，而掩蔽這些山岳的，則有鬯茂的樹林。就在這樣蠻荒的地點，我登陸作戰之一部分陸軍部隊以寡敵衆，返復著亘幾晝夜的大肉搏。我軍始終是在極艱難的條件下奮勇作戰著。兵器，槍彈，糧食，樣樣缺乏，但是我們依舊擊敗了敵人。</p>
<p>大陸上的戰門一日達七十次之多</p>
<p>還有，在中國大陸的戰錢上，皇軍反復着一日達七十次之多的重慶擊滅戰。最近，以美空軍作主體，約有二百五十架飛機在大陸各地對日展開遊擊戰，試行對本土的空襲，並企圖威脅內地問的輸送路，這無問題地，是和阿留申及比爾馬方面有關的整個美國對日反擊作戰之一部分。</p>
<p>這樣，在南太平洋方面，以及和這有關，在阿留申。比爾馬。以及中國大陸的各方面，整個美國對日反擊作戰是開始了。關於這次戰爭作爲長期戰的意義，再申述如下：</p>
<p>戰爭之作爲長期戰的意義</p>
<p>戰爭現已到達了峰巓。武力之戰，雖已有勝負之分，但敵人仍未降伏，游擊戰仍在繼續進行中，也可以說，初戰敗北之後，敵人正想重整軍容，以求數年後之決戰·到那時爲止，倘只有游擊戰或小規模戰持續的話，那麼，我國的對策就該是細而長一主義，一切都不離養精蓄銳的原則。但是，大東亞戰爭不單是這種樣式的一個長期戰。爲屈敵計，我們必須繼續進攻印度，澳洲及阿拉斯加等地，並擊潰敵人對我占領地域之反攻，在這中間，大小決戰不知凡幾，或則間隔，或則連續而行，而這次的戰爭，就是這樣大小決戰在畏期間內一直持續着的一個長期戰。在運動比賽上說，這不是馬拉松賽跑，而是馬拉松障碍物賽跑。如果是馬拉松賽跑的話，開步時不出力跑也行的，但馬拉松障碍物賽跑，却非開頭就出力不可。</p>
<p>戰爭是長期和短期的複合</p>
<p>所以，今天的長期戰，乃一般所說的長期戰與短期戰之複合體；也可說是一種馬拉松障碍物賽跑。戰爭指導，國內對策以及佔領地行政等等的困難，就肇因於此。譬如就生產擴充一點而言，假使單是一般所說的長期戰，那麼，即使將目前生產量减縮許多，只要好幾年以後所必要的東西並不缺少，就行；再者，假使單是短期決戰，那麼，以後一切均可不加考慮，只要傾全力於今天的增產，也就行了。但是，因爲是複合性的長期戰之故，一方面要爲明天的決戰準備，同時也不可不想釗好幾年以後的許多事情。假使在明天的準備和好幾年以後的準備，其間有了矛盾的塲合，我們就該先注重明天的準備，而予以急速的處置。</p>
<p>何以故？因爲明天如果戰敗的話，不管你如何努力以後的增產，在終極的大決戰上，你也決不能獲勝。現在，美國人正在對我們施行反擊。美國人是把戰爭看成Sports（運動）的。運動最要緊的是銳氣。戰爭也講究銳氣，所以戰爭可以說是一種大運動。下面的話，是數萬俘虜異口同聲地說着的。開戰以來，歷經好幾次敗北，但是這次反擊假使慘遭挫折的話，戰局大體就決定了，今後的戰爭恐怕要棄權也說不定的。（淡如譯）</p>

<h3>從南太平洋海戰談到明日之決戰　參加對談者　大本營海軍報道部課長平出大佐　東日編輯主幹阿部賢一（四）　譯自十二月十三日「星期每日」</h3>
<p>平出　上次世界大戰中，德國就有潛水商船，聞到紐約去過的。</p>
<p>·持以百年大戰的決意…</p>
<p>阿部　我們抱着必勝的信念，要澈底擊敗英美，國內一切方面生產活動的强化，也是非常重要的條件之一·我們銑後的第一任務就是：生產擴充。這次戰爭，要延長到何年何月，却不可知，正像一個人在勞働着一樣，典奮的時候也有，疲倦的時候也有。不管怎樣，我們總得各盡本分，幫助政府完成預定的計劃，也就是幫助保證大東亞戰爭最後的勝利。</p>
<p>平出　生產擴充假使能順利地進展，前綫將士就無後顧之憂，那麽戰爭一定得獲全勝的。然而生產擴充中還有不能遺忘的一部份，那就是「人」的生產擴充。在進行這樣的大戰爭的塲合，人口率的减少，那是世界的原則。關於這點，「厚生省」自然盡了最大的努力，但是迫於自然的趨勢，戰爭的結果，人口率總是减少下來的。所以，先決問題不得不是：多生些孩子出來！其次，孩子們的敎育，也非常重要。我們得加强國家主義的敎育，使孩子們都成爲身心健全的優秀人種。用以補足人數之少，道是最好的方法。假使這一點能做到，思想，頭腦和身體三方面成爲三位一體的優秀者，那麽，即使人數少，也可以以一抵十，有恃無恐的。生產擴充中的第二戰士的生產擴充，是一個嚴重的問題。不是孩子生出來就完事，而是得使之成爲精兵。關於這點，我們在「軍事援護强化週間」也曾說過很多。軍事援護聲中，頂重要的就是生產擴充。在第一綫打仗的兵士們只有二大心事！一是武器的補充和供給，二是國內人們的和平生活。支配第一錢兵士頭腦的，說來說去，就是這兩件事呀。</p>
<p>阿部　說到這裏，我們可以得出這樣的結論，就是說：靠了我們陸海軍的威力，我們已在著著勝利了，我們在後方人民的任務就在使在前線的人們能繼續安心作戰。要使前綫的人們安心作戰，我們就得盡一切力從事生產，製造武器，以及完成其他許多必要的工作。此後二十年，三十年的事，非現在立刻予以考慮不可。盎格羅。撤克遜民族是二三十年後還要站起來的民族。即使一度歿落了，再隔二十年，他們也還是要起來的。相當的長年月之後，再來一次歷火性的決戰，也是未可預料的。</p>
<p>平出　也許三次返復地進行決戰，亦未可知。所訓百年戰爭，就是指這個而言。這並不是說百年間不斷地在打仗，而是說一度站了起來，還要二度三度地打下去。對於這一點，我們只要稍有疏忽，最後勝利就不能「必屬於我」。</p>
<p>本社　勞二位說了很多話，謝謝……（錢牧譯）</p>

<p>糧食問題論壇</p>
<h3>進一步芻議</h3>
<p>— 陳憲謨</p>
<p>上海糧食問題，日趨嚴重？是誠不可忽親，申報倡之於前，商會主席袁履登先生論之於後，其嚴重性實母庸諱飾，第於具體方法，尚未議及，余以市民之一份子，敢作進一步之探討。</p>
<p>關於解決糧食嚴軍性之對策，綜合過去宏論所提，約得下列數論：</p>
<p>（一）增加計口授糧數量，</p>
<p>（二）切實疏散無業居民，</p>
<p>（三）實行發給米票制，</p>
<p>（四）應許負販暨米商自由採購。</p>
<p>對第一項辦法，似屬刻不容緩之舉，第二項尚有賴於市民本身之檢舉，及當道之嚴格甄別，第三項似於事實上較難着手，第四項或於統制政策上　有阻碍，故除第一項爲當前急務外，其他各項可暫不爲計，蓋一般市民，每人每期所領之米，無論如何，不敷甚巨，倘能增加過半，使每人於每日適求其飽，可無再求戶口米以外之補充必要、所謂杜米之價、不跌自跌、非獨於此、恐杜米之需要、亦必無人問津、同時、其他物價之漲風立戢、自在意中、故今之戶口米應行增加配給額、可成爲天經不易之理、市民應於此時此日、作有系統之請求、望當局予以採納、目前保甲制度、辦理尚見完善、凡屬保甲內之市民、人人有切身利害之關係、應於保甲區內、挨戶微求意見、由各戶長各就其所屬之保甲區內、共同簽名、然後彙同各保、呈請聯保長轉呈市商會主席、向當局作愼重之要求、使糧食問題早日解決、欲求適應中日協力大東亞戰爭之需要、與同時顧念人民最低限度之生活前提、必須實踐糧食政策於準備長期化的需要、如此要求、當局諒必採納民意、使人民减輕痛苦、無異拯市民於水深火熱之中、</p>
<h3>一個報告</h3>
<p>— 閑閑</p>
<p>我現在把我一個家庭的糧食問題報告出來。我是個薪水階級中的人，夫婦二人。最近的十天領到戶口米，糙米二升，碎米一升，麵粉三斤。我們是北方人，本來最喜歡吃麵粉；可是這三斤麵粉，照每人每頓半斤計算，只可供一天半的吃。糙米碎米合起來是三升，共是七十八兩。我二人每頓吃十三兩，共吃三天。所以領到的戶口米，只够四天半的吃。其餘的五天生，共是十一頓飯，只好買苞米粉豌豆粉，黃小米等補充，每頓須十四兩，共約十斤左右。自十一月間，苞米粉每斤自二元二角漲到三元五角，黃小米自每斤三元漲到四元四角，所以十日之內，約增加了負担十三元，一月之間，竟增加了負担三十九元餘。倘如一個家庭是十個人，那末就要加重一百九十餘元了，能不說是最嚴重的問題嗎？我常到各處的雜糧店，觀看各種雜糧價的木簽，差不多一二日就漲一回，有一次前一天的黃小米，是每斤三元三角，第二日就漲到四元。所以現在糧食的價錢，漲到若干才能止住，是誰也不敢預言，想到這裏，怎不敎人不寒而慄呢。所以我們日夜禱祝賢明當局，將戶口米增加一倍，十日之內，我們就可以有九天的糧食，所差一天的糧食，就易於解決了。眞如大旱之望雲霓。</p>

<h3>公債趨勢軟化</h3>
<p>公債趨勞、漸形軟化、一以無‘式市塲、無法流通、二以年關伊邇、銀根又緊所以尚有行市者、祗極少數搶帽子者、欲賴以維持生活而已、故價之起伏範圍、亦極有限、即共所做之價、亦不足代表該公債之本値、昨丙種初曾做過七元有　、後又退至六元三四角、甲戊無市、乙種五元五六角、丁種三元五六角而已、屆此年關結束期債市本亦趨於間散、况在此統制期內乎、故交易亦至爲微細、</p>

<h3>聆黃鐘社播音</h3>
<p>— 勞倫斯</p>
<p>上海天主敎當局最近積極舉辦多種事業，宣揚天主敎的眞諦。本月十三日午後六時三十分，天主敎黃鐘播音社，假霞飛路文化電台，播送演講歌唱及話劇。筆者純爲聽衆立塲，以聽聞所得，披之報端，以饗未曾收聽的讀者。</p>
<p>演講講題是「天主敎與科學」，由震旦大學理化系土仁生敎授主講。王敎授學術豐富，講說內容頗有價値，大抵是述說歐洲科學進展的步程和天主敎的關係的歷史性故事。王敎授演講時，很有點像默想時的提示。</p>
<p>歌唱由慈幼會歌詠團播唱。據筆者所悉，該會對於音樂，是認爲專修的一門，會士們都有相當的修養。唱來有出神人化之概，不無飄飄欲仙，尤其是第三曲Magnum　Agnum，由四部會唱。</p>
<p>話劇是一則英國某地的紀實性故事，劇名「湖上星光」，是一首深含詩意的短劇。此次該社播送，開始時的鋼琴，彈得頗爲合適，這正襯　出星仪湖上的幽靜。話劇員方面，比較稍爲幼稚些：第一是「上海白」的話劇，不大合人胃口，第二是劇詞方面的抑揚頓挫，因得運用「上海白」的關係，很難顯明；還有就是在口語力面，很多「徐家櫃鄉腔」，如「是我（我）」，「是儂（你）」，「是伊（他）」之類，頗爲難聽。其他方面，如以幾首不同的歌曲，來陪襯悄緒，船到埠時的笛聲等，都應用得很爲成功，頗値一提。綜之，該社播送話劇，尚屬初度，而有這樣的成績，是値得欽佩和讚揚的。就以電台話劇塲合觀察，其成績也在水準之上，此是無可諱言的。（却酬）</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>一二　後庭花</p>
<p>維城和黃龍倆，回到了王順興客棧裏。客棧裏的賭局，已然散了，也沒見精神抖擻的王瘋子坐在帳桌上。維城關了門，把桌子輕輕的拍了一下：拍是表示憤怒，輕輕的拍是防備着隔房裏有別的客人聽到。然後嘆出一聲來道：「完了完了」，黃龍道：「也沒有算白跑，不會錯的，程炳準是那老婆子的兒子」。維城道：「怎麼沒有白跑？程炳固然是陳老太太的兒子，陳老太太固然便是程老太太，陳老太太即使否認，也是欲蓋彌彰的了。可是程炳呢？程炳不是死了嗎？我要報父母之仇，仇人已然死了，你說這是一件如何痛心的事呀」？黃龍給說的瞪着雙眼，把兩個拳頭，揑的骨節裏咇　咇　的響，笑道：「也許是他們詭計多端：程炳實在是沒有死，哄我們，就是死了，讓我們死了要殺他的心」。黃龍也乖巧了，把個殺字，說得輕輕的。</p>
<p>維城沈吟一下道：「這個不會：你是想入非非了。他們怎麽知道我們已經發覺程炳便是陳老太太的兒子了呢？他們旣然不知道，便用不着哄我們，所以我說你是想入非非，你也是神經過敏」。黃龍點了點頭。一邊點頭，一邊忙不迭從褥子底下，颼一聲，抽一柄白亮得銀子似的短刀，撩起了袴腿，往襪統裏一塞，臉上白的頓時暴起了幾條靑筋。維城慌了道：「你做什麽」？黃龍道：「你現在不要問我，你只睡在被窩裏，我去一去就來。我常常聽說書先生說的溫酒斬華雄，關雲長在斬了華　回來，一杯酒還沒凉；我現在倒一杯茶在這裏，去斬了那個老不死的老婆子回來，這茶也準是不會凉，你不要替那老婆子向我說情，我看那老婆子，說話喘氣，也沒幾天好活，倘然不下手，等她死了，倒又沒法奈何他，那就不好」。黃龍說完話，不等維城答話，開了門往外就跑。（二四四）</p>
<h3>馬來敗戰回顧錄（六）</h3>
<p>— 前馬來英陸軍司令　帕雪維爾將軍手記</p>
<p>二月十日（星期二），決心將第十八師團抽調一部分出來，用以增强兵力。到二十一日（星期三）早晨，已配置好了大部隊的預備兵力。蒲基退馬跑馬塲失去　，盡力保持阿達姆洛特附近陣地的安全。二月十二日（星期四），第十八師團的全部不得不自北部地區撤退。還有：（一）印度軍第十一師團自海軍基地地區撤退。（二）强基及東南海岸地區部隊也於二月十二日（星期四）向後退却。這樣，到十三日（星期五），星加坡前馬來英陸軍司令帕雪維爾將軍手記市周圍的卡朗飛機塲，比達達利，馬克利契貯水池，亞當，羅特，亞力山大等各地域，都將新陣地建築了起來。二月十四日（星期六），由於本襲及砲擊，水道管被炸裂殆盡，星加坡市的給水遂感極度困難。到十五日（星期日）早上，給水狀況愈形惡化，致使專家們宣告以後只有一晝夜的給水了。這是我們決定於十五日投降的最大原因。</p>
<p>空中狀况</p>
<p>上面的回顧錄，關於空中狀况，差小多毫無觸及。這狀况，不但是英軍，就是日軍當局也不大明瞭。英國因爲在其他方面尚有別的任務，所以不能將必要的空軍勢力派遣到馬來方面來。自最初數日起，日軍就獲得了完全的制空權，直到最後，一直沒有失却。這對我們是件非常麻煩的事，特別是在海岸作戰時，不能自由行動，而不　情報洩漏於日軍。還有，在星加坡地域的行動，也同樣受到重大的影響。就是說，飛機塲的修理，船塢的作業等等，都非常不便。</p>

<h3>Understanding and Preparation for a Protracted War</h3>
<p>The ongoing World War is being forced towards the prospect of a "protracted war." Because once a war is launched, as the famous German strategist Clausewitz said, "It will not follow the will of the war initiator, but will follow the laws of war itself!" The current war, after being brewed and promoted by Britain and the United States, has been moving towards a protracted war day by day. Moreover, the United States and its system are exaggerating magical numbers, intentionally driving Britain, the Soviet Union, Chongqing, etc., to wage a war against the Axis powers, in order to dominate the world when everyone is exhausted, so they are intentionally making the war enter a protracted phase. However, from the perspective of East Asian countries, how should we observe the meaning of the so-called protracted war? Recently, an article by Colonel Taniogi Nahao, Chief of the Army Press Section of the Japanese General Headquarters, "The New Face of Protracted War" (translation appears in today's newspaper), is worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>Colonel Taniogi frankly pointed out the current war situation and the trend towards a protracted war, and Japan's determination for "tomorrow's decisive battle." He said, "In order to thoroughly subdue Britain and the United States in the future, our army will attack India, Australia, Alaska, etc. In the meantime, there will be countless major and minor decisive battles, either spaced apart or continuous. Therefore, today's protracted war can be said to be a composite of protracted and short-term wars." He further clearly pointed out that a protracted war is beneficial to the Axis powers. He pointed out, "In the near future, if the United States and Britain cannot achieve a decisive victory, the domestic and foreign situation will fall into a difficult state. In any case, in the next year or two, the United States and Britain must deploy all their forces to inflict a fatal blow on the Axis powers. In other words, a protracted war is just empty talk, and they still hope for a quick victory." So, from the perspective of the interests of East Asian countries and peoples, what kind of preparations should be made in a protracted war of this meaning? Colonel Taniogi made it clear that because this war is "a protracted war in which major and minor decisive battles continue for a long period of time. In track and field competitions, this is not a race, but an obstacle race. If it is a race, it is okay not to exert effort at the beginning, but in an obstacle race, you must exert effort from the beginning!" Therefore, in order to achieve the final victory, Japan must not only prepare the necessary conditions for victory in the final conclusion of the war, but also, because this final decisive battle is also an accumulation of victories in "major and minor decisive battles" that "continue for a long period of time," it must immediately concentrate all the forces of the domestic occupied areas and allied countries to prepare for victory in the major and minor decisive battles during the protracted war.</p>
<p>We, China, are in such an era of protracted war, and in such a war environment and strategic requirements. According to the task of cooperation between China and Japan in the Greater East Asia War, it is also necessary to assign new tasks to China and its people, just as this war has given to Japan and its people.</p>
<h3>Meeting of Japanese Ambassadors and Consuls in China Opens in the Capital This Morning to Discuss Plans to Intensify Sino-Japanese Cooperation Ambassador Shigemitsu Returns to Japan After the Meeting</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th, Domei News Agency - According to official sources, under the guidance of the Greater East Asia Ministry, the new initiative of Japanese agencies stationed in China is to expand the authority of Ambassador Shigemitsu Kuri, placing Inner Mongolia, North China, Central China, and South China under the jurisdiction of Shigemitsu Kuri, which can make Japan's policies in China proceed more smoothly and achieve its goals quickly. From now on, the Minister in Shanghai, under the guidance of Ambassador Shigemitsu Kuri, will handle the affairs of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. However, regarding the affairs of Japanese residents and embassy staff, there is no need to report to superiors and they can be handled freely. At the same time, North China enterprises will be handled by the Minister in Beijing, and Central China enterprises will be handled by the Minister in Shanghai.</p>
<p>According to news from the Shanghai Continental News, the conference of Ministers and Consuls-General convened by Ambassador Shigemitsu is scheduled to open in Nanjing today to discuss various issues, including plans to intensify Sino-Japanese cooperation. Other topics include adhering to the instructions of Minister Aoki of the Greater East Asia Ministry, consolidating the specific plans of the National Government, and reorganizing the administrative organs of Japan stationed in China on a large scale to adapt to the second year of the Greater East Asia War. It is reported that Minister Shiozawa from Beijing and Minister Watanabe from Zhangjiakou left Shanghai for Nanjing at 9:00 am yesterday to attend the meeting.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 16th, Domei News Agency - According to an announcement here, the conference of Japanese Ministers and Consuls to China, which will open tomorrow morning, will last for two days.

<p>Tokyo, 16th, Domei News Agency - According to reliable sources here, Japanese Ambassador to Nanjing, Shigemitsu Kuri, is convening an embassy meeting in Nanjing, which will last for two days. Once the meeting is over, he will return to Tokyo again next week.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 16th, Central News Agency - The conference of Japanese Ministers and Consuls-General in China is specifically scheduled to be held in Nanjing on the 17th and 18th. This conference is not only the first important conference after the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry, but also coincides with the start of the second year of the Greater East Asia War, which further increases its importance. Since the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry, the local agencies have been unified. Japan is actively cooperating with our National Government to strengthen it, making it smoother. This conference is to be conducted in accordance with the established policy of strengthening the National Government through Sino-Japanese cooperation.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 16th, Central News Agency - The Japanese Embassy in China, based on its established policy of striving to strengthen the National Government, has decided to convene Ministers and Consuls-General stationed in various parts of China in Nanjing today (the 17th) to hold a cooperation meeting at the embassy. It is learned that Kamimura, Director of the Political Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Okumura, Chief of the Second Section, Imai, investigator of the Greater East Asia Ministry, and other officials sent by the Japanese government arrived in Nanjing yesterday (the 16th). Minister Shiozawa from Beijing, Minister Iwasaki from Mengjiang, Minister Tajiri from Shanghai, and twelve Consuls-General, including Kitazawa from Beijing, Yano from Shanghai, and Akahori from Xiamen, also arrived in Nanjing one after another. The conference is scheduled to begin at 9:45 am this morning (the 17th).</p>
<p>Nanjing, 16th, Central News Agency - The first conference of Ministers and Consuls-General stationed in various parts of China since the Japanese agencies in China were completely unified under the jurisdiction of the Greater East Asia Ministry will be held in Nanjing on the 17th and 18th. The most noteworthy point about this conference is that after the integration of various agencies, their functions and powers have been greatly strengthened. They have direct command and supervision over Ministers and Consuls-General in China. Major affairs in Mengjiang, North China, Central China, and South China will all be under the command of the Ambassador from now on. Therefore, the handling of policies towards China can be carried out quickly and forcefully. A summary of the new functional operations of agencies in China is as follows: (1) The Ambassador has the power to command and supervise Ministers, Consular Officers, Consuls-General, and Consuls in China. (2) Ministers stationed in Zhangjiakou and Beijing are, in principle, under the command and supervision of the Ambassador. However, for certain matters, such as affairs concerning the Mengjiang United Autonomous Government or the North China Political Affairs Commission, and administrative affairs for Japanese residents, unless otherwise instructed, the Ministers are directly under the command and supervision of the Minister of the Greater East Asia Ministry, and each Minister has the power to command and supervise the Consular Officers within their respective regions. (3) The Minister stationed in Shanghai is under the command and supervision of the Ambassador, and handles affairs under the jurisdiction of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. However, administrative affairs related to Japanese residents are handled by the Minister, and he commands and supervises the Consular Officers in Central China and South China. (4) The supervision of local affairs of the North China Development and Central China Promotion Companies is undertaken by the Ministers in Beijing and Shanghai, respectively. Therefore, the supervision of the affairs of the North China Development Minister, which was formerly under the supervision of the foreign officials related to Mengjiang, will also be handled by the Minister stationed in Beijing in a unified manner. (5) However, legal matters related to consular trials are directly commanded and supervised by the Minister of the Greater East Asia Ministry to each Consular Officer.</p>

<h3>Japan and Vietnam Enjoy Friendly Relations; De Gaulle Inspects Saigon</h3>
<p>Saigon, 15th, Domei News Agency - Governor-General De Gaulle of French Vietnam, who is here on inspection, told reporters today that relations between Japan and Vietnam are very friendly, which is largely due to Ambassador Ayasawa's amiable attitude. Eight French and Vietnamese youths have now been sent to study in Japan under the student exchange program. An exhibition of Vietnamese art will also be held in Tokyo. As for the defense of Vietnam, after Japan and Vietnam signed a joint defense agreement, the necessary measures have been taken and air defense has been completed. From now on, Vietnamese civilians should no longer be subjected to unwarranted bombings.</p>
<h3>Governor-General Isogai Discusses the Restoration of Hong Kong in the Past Year</h3>
<p>Hong Kong, 16th, Central News Agency - Governor-General Isogai of Hong Kong, on the occasion of the upcoming one-year anniversary of the occupation of Hong Kong on December 25th, issued a statement on the restoration of Hong Kong in the past year, as follows: The purpose of occupying Hong Kong is to thoroughly construct a new order in East Asia, establish the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and make it an important base for the countries of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Based on this belief, I am engaged in governance and construction, making Hong Kong a base for cooperating in the completion of the Greater East Asia War. This is the basic policy of the military administration, and all aspects of politics, economy, education, and culture are carried out in accordance with this basic policy. However, with regard to the restoration of Hong Kong, the trends of the millions of overseas Chinese residing here should be considered. If their psychology can be grasped and they can be made to sincerely cooperate with our policies, then the completion of a bright Hong Kong and the completion of the Greater East Asia War will be closer. With the cooperation of the Chinese and Japanese people, port facilities, some factories, and cultural facilities in Hong Kong are all under construction. The shipping business has also been started, and trade with the coastal areas of Guangzhou, Shantou, and Macau is gradually progressing smoothly. Therefore, there is no need to worry about the shortage of food and other essential supplies. There has also been significant progress in education and health, which has resulted in the stability of the people's hearts. The state of construction of a bright Hong Kong cannot be said to be sufficient, but I am very satisfied with the achievements made in one year.</p>
<h3>British Houses of Parliament Hold Secret Meeting to Discuss Situation in North Africa</h3>

<h3>Order</h3>
<p>Order of the National Government, December 16, 1942: The Garrison Division is hereby abolished. This is the order.</p>
<h3>The New Face of the Protracted War: Report by Colonel Taniogi Nahao, Chief of the Army Press Section, Imperial General Headquarters Translated from the "Osaka Newspaper," December 9</h3>
<p>At 6:00 PM on the 8th, the Tokyo Hibiya Public Hall held a grand speech commemorating the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, titled "Smashing America and Britain." Colonel Taniogi Nahao, Chief of the Army Press Section of the Imperial General Headquarters, gave a detailed interpretation of the current war situation, titled "The New Face of the Protracted War." Colonel Taniogi said: "In the future, in order to thoroughly subdue America and Britain, our army will advance on India, Australia, Alaska, and other places. In the midst of this, countless major and minor battles will take place, either intermittently or continuously. Therefore, today's protracted war can be said to be a combination of protracted and short-term wars. However, if there is a contradiction between preparations for tomorrow and preparations for several years from now, we should focus on preparations for tomorrow and take swift action." From this, it can be seen that the current war situation is of extremely serious significance.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the enemy, America and Britain, were vulnerable and defeated one after another. In East Asia, not a single base or soldier remained. Due to repeated defeats, the morale of the American government and public was very low, and their initial ideas for war guidance were inevitably passive and reactive. After a considerable period of time, they gradually regained their composure and began to establish independent strategies. That is to say, they interpreted the purpose of the war as defending democracy. On the one hand, they whipped Chongqing; on the other hand, they encouraged the Soviet Union, using them to restrain Japan and Germany, consuming the Axis powers' forces, and turning the war into a long-term, protracted war. In the meantime, they demanded extreme sacrifices from other countries, while they themselves became the arsenal of the democratic nations, specializing in logistical support. Rather than lending, they were selling weapons to obtain huge profits, and even after the war, they would continue this exploitation, making the whole world materially subordinate to America. Therefore, in terms of operational plans, they intended to greatly expand their land, sea, and air forces by 1944, and take advantage of the Axis powers' fatigue from prolonged warfare to launch a large-scale counterattack and achieve final victory in one fell swoop. As for Chongqing and the Soviet Union, which had been conducting guerrilla warfare with aircraft and submarines, they would do their best to support them.</p>
<p>America Hopes that Britain, the Soviet Union, and Chiang Kai-shek will Perish Together</p>
<p>In the final moment, only America would exist. Japan, Germany, and Italy, needless to say, but also Britain, the Soviet Union, and Chiang Kai-shek - America hoped they would all die out. That is to say, America wanted to repeat the cunning tricks it had used in World War I. However, with the progress of the war, they had to begin to realize that this path was not feasible. The reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>In order to defend democracy, America had to join hands with the Soviet Union, the greatest enemy of democracy, which was a major contradiction. Secondly, nominally a democratic country, it was actually strengthening the dictatoral power of the president, which was also very ridiculous. Recently, Roosevelt and Churchill had been enthusiastically producing the Atlantic Charter, proclaiming the need to respect freedom, but before their tongues had even dried, they were raping the will of the Indian people and suppressing their independence. In Iran, Iraq, Syria, Madagascar, and most recently in North Africa, they were carrying out illegal invasions against all weak countries and weak nations as if nothing had happened. A robber who has removed their mask, shamelessly says: "I am your friend." In particular, the Soviet Union was demanding the supply of military supplies and the opening of a second front at the cost of great sacrifice, but America and Britain sincerely hated such requests. This is increasingly believed to be true in regards to the US-Soviet agreement and the Anglo-Soviet agreement. In fact, the weapons used on the Soviet front are very few of American manufacture, and even those that exist are very old-fashioned. Furthermore, Stalin had already stated that America and Britain were not sincere in opening a second front.</p>
<p>America's Work with Chongqing</p>
<p>The Soviet Union, since the German army began its offensive this summer, had exhausted its war power and was now almost in a desperate situation. Chongqing, on the other hand, was experiencing rampant hyperinflation, a lack of supplies, and so on, and was eagerly awaiting aid from America and Britain. Both Chongqing and America were exploiting each other, which led to conflicts of interest and a tendency to break away. It was true that America had sent some aircraft to China, but according to the words of the captured American air force pilots who attacked Hong Kong, they were very dissatisfied with their combat life in China. On the other hand, as a result of the bombing, many innocent Chinese people suffered direct and indirect damage, and Chongqing also expressed various dissatisfactions with them.</p>
<p>The contradiction in war aims, the wavering of popular sentiment, the fear of weak countries, the stagnation of the German-Soviet war, the tendency of the Soviet Union and Chongqing to break away… these were all problems that gave America a headache. In addition, facing the strong national power of the Axis powers, especially Japan, America had to change its war guidance policy. That is to say, America, which had previously been the arsenal of the democratic nations, had to step onto the front line of combat. Roosevelt had previously said that American youth would never be sent to fight in other countries, but now, hundreds of thousands of young people had been sent out, and they were dying and being wounded every day, in numbers a hundred or a thousand times greater than those announced by the authorities. Some sank to the bottom of the sea, while others were reduced to white bones in the desert.</p>
<p>When America counterattacks Japan, it pays special attention to the two factors of "time" and "things," as detailed above. But can they really win? No, it is absolutely impossible. The construction of Japan's Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is proceeding very smoothly, and Germany and Italy are continuing to exert their power in Europe. This is the guarantee of victory for whoever wins the decisive battle.</p>
<p>A Protracted War is Advantageous to the Axis Powers</p>
<p>Therefore, the longer the war lasts, the more profitable it will be for the Axis powers. In terms of shipping alone, America produces 500,000 tons per month, and Britain 100,000 tons, for a total of only about 600,000 tons. However, Axis submarines sink 700,000 to 800,000 tons each month, and sometimes even break the million-ton mark. If this continues, even if America and Britain fight like trapped beasts, their fighting spirit will not last long.</p>
<p>We may as well analyze it further: In the case of Britain, its shipping capacity must be maintained at at least about 7 million tons, otherwise, supply will be very difficult. In the case of America, no matter how developed its production capacity is, there are limits. In particular, many "tropical resources" essential to the military industry, such as rubber, tin, tungsten, etc., are very scarce. In addition, the unevenness of rationing, the lack of skilled workers, and the difficulty in replenishing the forces lost in repeated defeats are all causing America anxiety. Therefore, in the near future, if America and Britain cannot achieve a decisive victory, the domestic and international situation will fall into a state of difficulty. In any case, America and Britain must mobilize all their forces within the next year or two to inflict a fatal blow on the Axis powers. That is to say, a protracted war is just empty talk, and they still hope for a quick victory in their hearts.</p>
<p>The Importance of Guadalcanal</p>
<p>In this way, America began counterattacks in the South Pacific from early August and in the West Philippine from early November, on both the east and west sides. In the South Pacific, the focus is on Guadalcanal Island in the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>Guadalcanal Island is about 2,700 nautical miles from Tokyo, and its area is about 10 miles long and 40 miles wide. It is simply a drop in the ocean in the Pacific. The island is sparsely populated, and most of it is rugged mountainous terrain, which is covered by lush forests. In such a wild place, a portion of our landing operations troops fought against a much larger enemy, repeatedly engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat for several days and nights. Our army has always fought bravely under extremely difficult conditions. Weapons, bullets, and food were all lacking, but we still defeated the enemy.</p>
<p>Battles on the Mainland Reached Seventy Times a Day</p>
<p>In addition, on the battle lines of mainland China, the Imperial Army repeatedly engaged in Chongqing annihilation battles as many as seventy times a day. Recently, with the US Air Force as the main force, about 250 aircraft have launched guerrilla warfare against Japan in various parts of the mainland, attempting to carry out air raids on the mainland and threatening inland transportation routes. This is undoubtedly a part of the entire American counterattack operation against Japan, related to the Aleutian and Burma fronts.</p>
<p>In this way, the entire American counterattack operation against Japan has begun in the South Pacific, and in all aspects related to it, in the Aleutians, Burma, and mainland China. Regarding the significance of this war as a protracted war, I will explain it further below:</p>
<p>The Significance of the War as a Protracted War</p>
<p>The war has now reached its peak. Although there has been a distinction between victory and defeat in the war of force, the enemy has not yet surrendered, and guerrilla warfare is still continuing. It can also be said that after the initial defeat, the enemy is trying to reorganize their forces in order to seek a decisive battle several years later. Until then, if only guerrilla warfare or small-scale battles continue, then our country's policy should be one of detail and length, and everything should not deviate from the principle of conserving strength and building up energy. However, the Greater East Asia War is not just a protracted war of this kind. In order to subdue the enemy, we must continue to attack India, Australia, Alaska, and other places, and defeat the enemy's counterattacks against our occupied areas. In the midst of this, countless major and minor decisive battles will take place, either intermittently or continuously, and this war is a protracted war in which these major and minor decisive battles continue for a period of time. In terms of sports competitions, this is not a marathon, but a marathon obstacle race. If it is a marathon, it is okay not to run hard at the start, but in a marathon obstacle race, one must exert oneself from the beginning.</p>
<p>The War is a Combination of Long-Term and Short-Term</p>
<p>Therefore, today's protracted war is a combination of what is generally called a protracted war and a short-term war; it can also be said to be a kind of marathon obstacle race. The difficulties in war guidance, domestic countermeasures, and occupied territory administration stem from this. For example, in terms of production expansion alone, if it were simply a protracted war in the general sense, then even if the current production volume were reduced significantly, it would be fine as long as the things needed several years later were not lacking. Furthermore, if it were simply a short-term decisive battle, then everything else could be disregarded, as long as all efforts were devoted to today's increased production. However, because it is a composite protracted war, on the one hand, we must prepare for tomorrow's decisive battle, and at the same time, we must not forget about the many things several years from now. If there is a contradiction between preparations for tomorrow and preparations for several years from now, we should focus on preparations for tomorrow and take swift action.</p>
<p>Why? Because if we are defeated tomorrow, no matter how hard you work to increase production later, you will never win in the ultimate decisive battle. Now, the Americans are launching a counterattack against us. Americans see war as Sports. What is most important in sports is vigor. War also emphasizes vigor, so war can be said to be a kind of great sport. The following words are said by tens of thousands of prisoners in unison. Since the start of the war, they have suffered several defeats, but if this counterattack is severely frustrated, the war situation will be largely decided, and they may have to give up on future wars.

<h3>Fierce Fighting Continues in Western Cyrenaica: British Frontal Offensive Repulsed, Attempts to Advance on Both Flanks Also Fail</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, German Headquarters, 16th - This afternoon's German military report stated that fierce fighting continued yesterday in western Cyrenaica. British losses included 16 tanks, multiple artillery pieces, and 4 aircraft. German aircraft bombed the port of Benghazi, and a German submarine pursued and sank an enemy submarine in the Eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Rome, 16th - This afternoon's Italian military report stated that German-Italian forces continued to engage in fierce fighting with strong enemy forces between Cyrenaica and Sirte, destroying 16 enemy tanks and multiple artillery pieces. The air force was also very active, with German aircraft shooting down 4 enemy planes. In Tunisia, our forces captured many American soldiers, and German aircraft heavily attacked the port of Bône with good results. Italian aircraft bombed fuel depots in Tripoli and refineries in Beirut, with 2 failing to return to base. Italian submarines sank an enemy ship near Algiers.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, 16th - London dispatches report that the British Eighth Army is advancing slowly. Any attempt at rapid advance will trigger German landmines, inevitably resulting in heavy casualties.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Berlin, 16th - According to military sources, the British army attempted to attack the Axis forces on the Cyrenaica front yesterday, but was repulsed due to a swift Axis counteroffensive. British Commander-in-Chief General Montgomery encountered extensive and well-laid minefields, forcing him to abandon frontal assaults along the coast and instead attack the German flanks. Although enemy soldiers and tanks were numerous, they were defeated by the determined and flexible defense of the Italian mechanized units. By evening, the British had lost 22 tanks and multiple armored vehicles. The weak British air force attempted to assist in the ground battle, but was intercepted by German fighter squadrons before reaching the battlefield, with 9 being shot down. The Axis forces suffered no losses. A British reconnaissance plane was also shot down.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 16th - Responsible sources stated yesterday that the British Eighth Army and the German-Italian forces under Rommel are continuing to fight. The battle situation in the Al 'Aqila area is particularly intense. Rommel's defensive strategy does not seem to be aimed at driving the enemy out of the Al 'Aqila area, but rather at using this battle to undertake new actions.</p>
<p>Rommel Changes Strategy: Joint Defense of Tunisia</p>
<p>Allied News Agency, Stockholm, 16th - London military circles are speculating about the sudden retreat of General Rommel's forces from Al 'Aqila. Although some newspapers claim that the German retreat will allow General Montgomery to advance rapidly, experts do not believe this move is beneficial to the Allies. British military opinion is that General Rommel understands that fighting in Al 'Aqila will have negative consequences, and the best strategy is to approach General Nehring's forces in Tunisia and, if possible, fight side-by-side. General Nehring currently has 30,000 troops and a continually increasing air force, but this is not yet a match for General Anderson's First Army. However, with the addition of Rommel's 50,000 troops, the situation would be different. The general opinion in London is that Rommel's objective is Tunisia, and they point out that the British naval bombardment of Axis positions along the coast is supporting the Eighth Army's advance, so Rommel's forces can only defend the more westerly areas. London military experts anticipate a long and arduous battle. The Eighth Army's supplies must still travel around the Cape of Good Hope, while reinforcements for the First Army are subject to attacks by German submarines in the Strait of Gibraltar, with multiple transport ships having already been sunk.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, 16th - Local newspapers report that a London correspondent stated that developments in the North African war remain the most closely watched event in British public opinion. Previously, the British advance into Tripolitania was generally considered a major victory, but this view has gradually changed recently. Rommel's forces advancing along Sirte could give the Axis powers a strategic advantage and geographical convenience in the Mediterranean. The airfields of Sicily are within sight across the sea, benefiting the Axis powers, while the Eighth Army's supply lines are becoming increasingly distant. The British believe that Rommel may abandon all of Tripolitania in order to focus on defending Tunisia, which is easier to control. What Rommel's strategy is will not be known for sure until a few days later. In short, based on reports from the North African front, the German-Italian forces are clearly retreating in a planned manner, maintaining good order. At the same time, the pursuing British forces are hindered by damaged roads and landmines, making it difficult to move quickly and offering few opportunities to engage the Axis forces. There is little news from Tunisia, and the British First Army remains on the defensive. The Allied forces at El Bahr have apparently completely withdrawn.</p>

They are deploying and attacking from the Terek region in the south to Lake Ilmen in the north. This move was anticipated by the German General Staff, and preparations have been made for a countermeasure, delivering a head-on blow. However, the details of the German countermeasure have not been announced.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 16th - Responsible sources report that a large tank battle took place between the Volga and Don rivers on Monday, destroying two Soviet tank regiments.

<h3>Laval Arrives in Paris, Will Meet with Hitler: Pétain Also Plans to Attend, Franco-German Relations Will Become Clear</h3>
<p>Allied News Agency, Lisbon, 16th - According to Vichy reports, French Prime Minister Laval has requested a meeting with German Chancellor Hitler in the near future, which Marshal Pétain also plans to attend. Laval has arrived in Paris.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Paris, 16th - French Prime Minister Laval arrived here yesterday and has met with Brinon, the French government's delegate-general to the German-occupied zone, Finance Minister Cathala, and Police Chief Bousquet.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Madrid, 16th - According to political observers here, French Prime Minister Laval has completed discussions with Marshal Pétain and his cabinet, so he will travel to Paris again. It is expected that this meeting will lead Franco-German relations into a new stage. Since the Allied forces invaded French colonies, it has been over two months. During this period, Prime Minister Laval has secured full governmental powers, enhanced his domestic position, and conducted specific reviews on strengthening the Mediterranean coastal defenses, adjusting the border line after the German forces entered the unoccupied zone, determining the legal status of the Dover Strait area, and restricting foreign diplomats when returning the capital to Paris. It is generally believed that because these pending issues have been resolved, it is expected that after Prime Minister Laval meets with Chancellor Hitler, he will make a final decision on the future relationship between Germany and France. It is also reported that Chancellor Hitler's representative, Field Marshal von Rundstedt, met with Marshal Pétain in Vichy on the 11th, expressing Germany's hope that France would rebuild its army. It is also expected that Prime Minister Laval will, based on the results of his meeting with Chancellor Hitler, return the capital to Paris within two or three months and immediately begin organizing a single political party.</p>

<h3>From the South Pacific Naval Battle to Tomorrow's Decisive Battle Participants in the Discussion: Naval Press Section Chief of the Imperial Headquarters, Colonel Hiraide; Editorial Director of the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun, Kenichi Abe (4) Translated from the December 13th "Sunday Mainichi"</h3>
<p>Hiraide: During the last World War, Germany had submarine merchant ships that were known to have gone to New York.</p>
<p>·A Resolution to Endure a Century-Long War...</p>
<p>Abe: With an unwavering belief in victory, we must thoroughly defeat Britain and the United States. Strengthening all aspects of domestic production is also a very important condition. Our primary task after smelting is: production expansion. It is impossible to know how many years and months this war will last. It's like a person working, with times of vigor and times of fatigue. Regardless, we must all do our part to help the government complete its planned goals, which is to help guarantee the final victory of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Hiraide: If production expansion can proceed smoothly, the soldiers on the front lines will have no worries about the rear, and then the war will surely be won. However, there is a part of production expansion that cannot be forgotten, and that is the production expansion of "people." In the event of such a large war, the reduction of the population rate is a world principle. Regarding this point, the "Ministry of Health and Welfare" has naturally made its best efforts, but due to natural trends, the war will always reduce the population rate. Therefore, the prerequisite problem must be: have more children! Secondly, the education of children is also very important. We must strengthen nationalistic education so that children become excellent people with sound minds and bodies. Using this to make up for the small number of people is the best way. If this can be achieved, and the three aspects of thought, mind, and body become a trinity of excellent individuals, then even if the number of people is small, they can still be worth ten, and there will be no fear. The production expansion of the second soldier in production expansion is a serious problem. It's not enough for children to be born, they must be made into elite soldiers. Regarding this, we have also said a lot during "Military Support Strengthening Week." The most important thing in military support is production expansion. Soldiers fighting on the front lines only have two major concerns! One is the replenishment and supply of weapons, and the other is the peaceful life of people at home. What dominates the minds of the front-line soldiers, in the end, is these two things.</p>
<p>Abe: Speaking of this, we can come to the conclusion that: relying on the power of our army and navy, we are already winning step by step. The task of our people in the rear is to enable the people on the front lines to continue to fight with peace of mind. To enable the people on the front lines to fight with peace of mind, we must do everything we can to engage in production, manufacture weapons, and complete many other necessary tasks. The matters of the next twenty or thirty years must be considered right now. The Anglo-Saxon nations are nations that will rise again in twenty or thirty years. Even if they have fallen once, they will still rise again in twenty years. Another fiery decisive battle after a considerable period of time is also unpredictable.</p>
<p>Hiraide: Perhaps we will have to repeat the decisive battle three times, which is also unknown. The so-called century-long war refers to this. This does not mean that we will be fighting constantly for a hundred years, but that once we stand up, we will have to fight a second and third time. If we are even slightly negligent in this regard, the final victory cannot "certainly belong to us."</p>
<p>The Newspaper: Thank you for saying so much, both of you... (Translated by Qian Mu)</p>

<h3>Vowing to Eradicate the Black Market with All Our Strength Applying Strong Measures Cooperation between the Police Department and the Control Office Awaiting the Final Step After Verification</h3>
<p>A senior official of the Shanghai Municipal Police stated, "The Police Department authorities will not cease investigating and prosecuting until the black market trade in this city is completely eliminated. The Materials Control Office is fully cooperating with the Police Department. Once the investigation is completed, strong measures will be taken against speculators and those engaged in black market transactions.</p>
<p>Speculative Merchants Entirely Brought to Court</p>
<p>The official continued to declare that last week, police officers at the cotton cloth exchange arrested 364 speculative brokers. This is the turning point for a comprehensive investigation. Those arrested are being interrogated one by one. If solid evidence is found, they will all be brought to court for trial. Because bringing them to court individually is more complicated, handling all of them together will result in the same crime being punished. When asked when the evidence will be verified, it is said that it will take at least one month. However, when taking the final step, the Materials Control Office and the Police Department will take a dominant position, and the elimination of black market activities is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Revealing the Masterminds Behind the Scenes</p>
<p>The recent efforts of the Police Department to curb black market transactions are due to the resurgence of speculative merchants engaging in illegal activities. The brokers and others who were arrested on the spot during the raid on the exchange had a lot of evidence. When asked what impact this investigation will have on the masterminds behind the scenes, it is said that the true faces of the masterminds will soon be revealed, and the punishment they receive will naturally be heavier than that of ordinary brokers. In three months, the number of speculative brokers arrested has reached thousands. After interrogation, there have been many new discoveries. These discoveries will greatly help the work of eliminating the black market.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Branch of the Relief Commission Manages Winter Relief in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Subsidizing the Puji Sanatorium with 100,000 Yuan Winter Relief Funds Set at 450,000 Yuan Donations from Allied Envoys to the Children's Education Institute</p>
<p>The Shanghai Puji Sanatorium in Minhang, Shanghai, is jointly funded and managed by the Public Concession, the French Concession, and the Shanghai Municipal Government. Now, Director-General Okazaki of the Public Concession has requested the Relief Commission to decide to allocate 100,000 yuan to the sanatorium. Director-General Okazaki and Chairman Fang Tongshen of the Shanghai Branch of the Relief Commission once discussed this matter in person, and this fund will be used for the quota of patients outside the city.</p>
<p>It is also heard that the Shanghai Branch of the Relief Commission's winter relief fund for this year has been decided to be 450,000 yuan, for handling porridge relief, clothing relief, shelter from the cold, and subsidizing charity projects. The estimated number of people receiving relief is more than 300,000 units. The branch is actively preparing. The Father Relief Commission has always attached great importance to the relief of refugee children. In addition to running the Capital Children's Education Institute, it is now planning to open the Shanghai Children's Education Institute, selecting the former site of the orphanage in Longhua. Chairman Fang Tongshen of the Shanghai Branch is responsible for the preparations. It is heard that in addition to the fixed relief funds, there are also 200,000 yuan donated by three Allied envoys. In the future, this institute will be a solemn friendly undertaking for the national societies of China and Japan.</p>
<h3>French Concession Checking Residence Permits</h3>
<p>The French Consul-General, Majella, issued a notice a few days ago stating that the identity residence permits for people in the concession have been fully issued and will be checked on a regular basis. If travelers stay in hotels, people pawn items in pawnshops, and pedestrians encounter checks on the road, they must show this document. The details have been reported in the newspapers. It is now known that this measure has been implemented since yesterday. In addition to hotels and pawnshops asking guests to verify their documents, police officers from the French Concession are dispatching Chinese and Vietnamese detectives at the iron gates at the junction of Huafa to conduct inspections. Certificates from the three parties of the two concessions and Nanshi are all valid for passage. However, because each one has to be checked one by one, it takes a lot of time, so pedestrians are extremely crowded. Those who do not carry this certificate, or the old certificates issued by Nanshi before, will be rejected and not allowed to enter the concession.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the residence permits in the urban area have not yet been fully issued, and some residents feel inconvenienced. It is now known that the authorities, in view of this, have made a special accommodation. Residents in the urban area can also pass through the iron gates with the fourth root of the residence permit application form.</p>
<h3>Air Raid Drills Continue Time of Alerts is Uncertain or May Not be Lifted All Night Long Arousing Public Awareness</h3>
<p>After the comprehensive air defense training exercises were held continuously for two days on the 14th and 15th, the alert was stopped for one day yesterday. It will continue to be held from today until the 23rd of this month. The training exercise will last for a total of ten days. The nature of this comprehensive air defense training exercise is different from the last one. Because the last one only controlled lights, the exercise was limited to the evening. This time, because important training programs have been added, the exercise is not limited to the evening. Air raid sirens will also be sounded at any time during the day.</p>
<p>The Timing of the Alerts is Not Fixed</p>
<p>Therefore, during the ten-day exercise period, the alert may not be lifted at night after the alert is issued in the evening, or it may only be held during the day and no alert is issued in the evening. It is extremely complex, arousing residents' awareness and creating an outstanding situation. Since yesterday, public concession police, baojia, self-defense corps members, and fire brigade members have begun special air defense control comprehensive training, and it is stipulated that it will be held in sections. Those who held it yesterday were the Yangshupu Yulin Road two districts, and today Jiayu Road and Hongkou District will continue to hold it.</p>
<p>Model Baojia in Lao Zha District Inspected</p>
<p>Baojia No. 4 Lianbao No. 4 in Lao Zha District of the Public Concession was recently designated by the authorities as a model baojia. The baozheng, Baochang Li Wencai, and deputy baochang Zheng Heyan Xu Yunsheng planned and organized it, establishing air defense, fire fighting, ambulance, traffic light control, and other teams, and once performed on-site, with satisfactory results. At 9:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, Captain Hashida Hashimoto, specially dispatched by the Naval Landing Force, led soldiers and, together with Chief Nakano of the Lao Zha Police Department, Chief of the Criminal Section Nagatokoro, and Okumura, the chief of the baojia system, went to the baojia for inspection. The baojia was greeted by all the baojia executives, Zhou Yutang, Chen Ruizhang, Yuan Rongsheng, etc. Then Shan Hao Ruichen, Ding Min, Jin Songsheng, and Wu Qinsun led all the team members to listen to the inspection, and the results were good. It is heard that at 9:00 a.m. this morning, the authorities will send personnel to continue to inspect the baojia. On the afternoon of the 19th, a comprehensive training exercise will be held, and there will be performances such as fire fighting and ambulance.</p>
<h3>Total Amount of Shanghai Old Currency Exchange</h3>
<p>Within one month in November, the National Old Currency Consolidation Committee stipulated that the comprehensive exchange of old currency should be carried out in three provinces and two cities. The relevant authorities in various places are now compiling accurate figures and submitting them. It is now learned that Shanghai has submitted the exchange of approximately 23 million yuan. Other places are rushing to complete the statistics. Once completed, the total amount of comprehensive exchange in the country can be settled and statistically analyzed.</p>
<h3>The 21st Period of Food Rationing by Headcount No Change in Allocation</h3>
<p>The 21st period of food rationing by headcount will begin on the 21st of this month. The quality and quantity of rice allocation are the same as the 20th period, still one liter of brown rice and half a liter of broken rice, priced at 3.8 yuan in new currency, and one and a half jin of flour, priced at 3.4 yuan in new currency, for a combined sale of 7.2 yuan. The authorities and the Rice Management Committee have not yet mentioned whether or not there will be sales for one day on New Year's Day.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Qingpu Branch Scheduled to Hold New Movement Training</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Qingpu Branch Political Work Group recently convened the second symposium for propaganda staff in various districts in the conference room of the association. It was decided to launch the New National Movement training work during the third phase of the propaganda work. Starting from January 4th next year, outstanding youths will be selected in each district to implement the training of the New National Movement separately.</p>
<h3>New Structure of the Japanese Shanghai Embassy Office Personnel Assignments in Five Departments Announced</h3>

<p>Food Problem Forum</p>
<h3>Further Suggestions</h3>
<p>— Chen Xianmo</p>
<p>Is the Shanghai food problem becoming more serious? It is indeed not to be ignored. Shen Bao advocated it in the past, and Chairman Yuan Ludeng of the Chamber of Commerce discussed it later. Its seriousness is indeed undeniable. However, concrete methods have not yet been discussed. As a citizen, I dare to make further explorations.</p>
<p>Regarding the countermeasures to solve the severity of the food problem, the following theories can be obtained by combining the grand theories of the past:</p>
<p>(1) Increase the amount of food rationing by headcount,</p>
<p>(2) Effectively evacuate unemployed residents,</p>
<p>(3) Implement a rice ticket system,</p>
<p>(4) Allow peddlers and rice merchants to purchase freely.</p>
<p>The first method seems to be an imminent move. The second still relies on the citizen's own reports and the strict discrimination of the authorities. The third seems to be more difficult to implement in practice. The fourth may be an obstacle to the control policy. Therefore, except for the first item being an urgent task at the moment, the other items can be temporarily ignored. Because the rice received by the general public every period, no matter what, is not enough. If it can be increased by more than half, so that everyone can seek their fill every day, there is no need to seek additional supplements other than household rice. The so-called price of illegal rice will fall without being suppressed. Not only that, I am afraid that no one will be interested in illegal rice. At the same time, the price increases of other commodities will be immediately curbed, which is expected. Therefore, the household rice should be increased in the allocation amount, which can become a natural law. Citizens should make systematic requests at this time and on this day, hoping that the authorities will adopt them. At present, the baojia system is still well managed. All citizens within the baojia have a vital interest. Opinions should be solicited from house to house within the baojia district. The heads of each household should jointly sign in their respective baojia districts, and then the baos should be collected and submitted to the lianbao chief for submission to the chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to make a cautious request to the authorities, so that the food problem can be solved as soon as possible. In order to meet the needs of Sino-Japanese cooperation and the Greater East Asia War, and at the same time take into account the minimum living conditions of the people, it is necessary to practice the food policy to prepare for long-term needs. The authorities will surely adopt public opinion in such a request, so that the people can reduce their suffering, which is no different from rescuing citizens from deep waters and scorching fires.</p>
<h3>A Report</h3>
<p>— Xianxian</p>
<p>I am now reporting on the food problem of my family. I am a salaried person, a couple. In the recent ten days, I received household rice, two liters of brown rice, one liter of broken rice, and three jin of flour. We are northerners and originally liked to eat flour the most; but these three jin of flour, calculated at half a jin per person per meal, can only provide one and a half days of food. Brown rice and broken rice together are three liters, totaling 78 taels. My husband and I eat 13 taels per meal, for a total of three days. So the household rice we received is only enough for four and a half days of food. For the remaining five days, a total of eleven meals, we had to buy corn flour, pea flour, yellow millet, etc. to supplement, requiring about 14 taels per meal, totaling about ten jin. Since November, corn flour has increased from 2.2 yuan per jin to 3.5 yuan, and yellow millet has increased from 3 yuan per jin to 4.4 yuan, so in ten days, the burden has increased by about 13 yuan, and in a month, the burden has increased by more than 39 yuan. If a family has ten people, then the burden will increase by more than 190 yuan. Can you say that it is not the most serious problem? I often go to various coarse grain stores to watch the wooden signs of various coarse grain prices. They increase almost every one or two days. Once, the yellow millet the day before was 3.3 yuan per jin, and the next day it increased to 4 yuan. So now, no one dares to predict how much the price of food will rise before it stops. Thinking of this, how can people not feel chills? Therefore, we pray day and night to the wise authorities to double the amount of household rice. Within ten days, we can have nine days of food, and the shortage of one day of food will be easy to solve. It is like hoping for clouds in a great drought.</p>

<h3>To Avoid Chaos Orderly Purchase of Oil Based on House Tax Receipts Each Household in Both Concessions Can Purchase Two Jin Urban Areas Can Purchase Half a Jin Based on Household Registration Certificates</h3>
<p>Recently, the amount of edible oil arriving in Shanghai has been relatively scarce, resulting in insufficient supply and sales. Although the edible oil industry wholesale department has tried its best to maintain it, it is like a drop in the bucket and still does not help. In recent days, the storefronts of various retail edible oil stores have been very crowded and disorderly. In view of this, the wholesale department specially decided yesterday to formulate a new method for purchasing oil. It is planned that starting from the 20th of this month, public concessions will purchase two gold coins based on autumn house tax receipts, and French concessions will purchase two gold coins based on September and October house tax receipts. Shanghai West, Nanshi, Zhabei, and Pudong will purchase half a jin of oil based on household registration certificates. It is heard that this is a temporary measure. Once the source is smooth, it will be improved. At present, there are a total of 5,000 dan that can be shipped for sale. If there are no unexpected obstacles, the supply of edible oil should be normal. Also, the allocation department is currently setting the retail price of edible oil at 7.2 yuan per jin for soybean oil and 6.2 yuan per jin for rapeseed oil.</p>
<p>Investigating and Punishing the Oil Cartel</p>
<p>According to the opinions expressed by the edible oil industry office, citizens are concerned that the supply of edible oil is about to run out, so they are all scrambling to buy, resulting in great chaos. The most hateful thing is that there are often unscrupulous citizens who organize an oil cartel, making it difficult for genuine oil buyers to buy. The police authorities have paid close attention to this point. Once it is cracked down, it will be severely punished. Also, retail stores sometimes deduct oil and create a black market. It is hoped that citizens will cooperate with the authorities and report such incidents to the police station. The most severe crime should be punished. Citizens may purchase oil based on house tax receipts, and if necessary, oil may be allocated based on headcount. These are all being carefully considered by the distribution authorities. Once realized, the fear of buying oil will be eliminated.</p>
<h3>Detailed Rules for Prohibiting the Trading of Stocks Have Been Promulgated Listing of Chinese Merchant Stocks Should Be Approved First</h3>
<p>The municipal government previously handed over the rules for prohibiting the trading of stocks by Shanghai stock industry merchants issued by the Ministry of Industry to the Social Affairs Bureau for drafting implementation rules. Now, the bureau has submitted a report, and the municipal government has revised and implemented it. The detailed rules are copied below: (1) Stock industry merchants should prepare an application form in accordance with the provisions of Article 2 of the Ministry of Industry's prohibition rules and apply to the Shanghai Special Municipality Social Affairs Bureau for registration. The application form style is formulated by the Social Affairs Bureau. (2) When stock industry merchants apply for registration, they should pay a registration fee of 50 yuan in national currency. (3) Stock industry merchants who have not been approved and registered by the Social Affairs Bureau shall not engage in the stock business of Chinese merchant companies, including those who are engaged in both businesses. (4) Stock industry merchants, except for merchants, banks, trust companies, etc. that also operate luxury goods, should pay a deposit in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of the Prohibition Rules. (5) The aforementioned deposit shall be collected and stored by the Shanghai Special Municipality Fuxing Bank and shall be given annual interest in accordance with the regulations. (6) If stock industry merchants encounter new shares of Chinese merchant companies being listed, they should first report to the Social Affairs Bureau. After verification, they can be traded.</p>

<h3>This Newspaper's Poverty Alleviation Movement Hoping for Social Response</h3>
<p>The social service department of this newspaper is appealing for the poor and sick refugees and launching a poverty alleviation movement. The reason has been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Now, Zhu Yiyun is undertaking his father's 30th anniversary and admiring his father's virtues, saving 1,000 yuan and donating it to the poverty alleviation fund. The action is purely voluntary and worthy of respect. The deposit yesterday was 1,000 yuan, and the total deposit is 2,000 yuan. Zhang Dianxiang also purchased 10 coupons for children's jackets and pants from Xiang San Nongchan Company and has delivered them to the refugee children wearing single clothes on the street. I hope that wealthy people will automatically purchase and send them. The merit is immeasurable.</p>

<h3>Eastern League Cup Charity Football Match, Act Two: Eastern League and Western League Squads Announced, Elites of East and West to Clash</h3>
<p>The second act of the charity football match hosted by the Shanghai branch of the East Asia League China General Association, a battle between the East China League Friendship Mixed Team and the Western League, is scheduled to take place at 3:00 PM this Sunday (the 20th) at the Jiao Zhou Park. The lineups of both teams have been carefully selected after serious consideration by the Western League, and were officially announced yesterday. The Eastern League team is composed of five players from Shandong, five from China, and six from the Friendship team. The goalkeeper position will be filled by Hong Kong player Liu Xianhan. The left-side defender is the stalwart Li Tiansheng, while the right side is covered by Zhuang Youren. The defensive strength appears extremely solid. Song Lingsheng sits in the center of the defense, flanked by his old partner Zheng Yingquan on the left and the young Han Longhai on the right. Song's position as a central pillar is undisputed in Shanghai, and his wisdom and bravery, combined with Longhai's cooperation, are invaluable. The striker position is led by Ade, who commands the three armies, with Sun Tuitui Xu Wenkui assisting on the left and right. The right winger is Jia Youliang, and the left winger is Zhuo Shijin. These five tiger generals will charge into battle and are sure to make the enemy crumble at the mere sight of them. The Western League team is mainly composed of players from the Italian Navy, with a total of six players selected. Old Wei Ketai of the Portuguese Business Association will play as right-back, Oliveira as right-wing midfielder, and V. Su Ruo as left inside forward. Only Fu En from St. Francis was selected. In addition, Nishida from the Japanese Association will serve as the left-wing midfielder. Overall, the Western League's lineup also appears very complete. At that time, there is sure to be a wonderful performance with the Eastern League, and it is unclear who will win. Le Xirong will manage the Eastern League, and Pasais will belong to the Western League. The lineups of both teams are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Chinese Stocks Continue to Fall, Great China Match Surges Amidst Acquisition Interest</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market situation continued to decline amidst the pressure of the approaching year-end and tight credit. However, some stocks rose on favorable news. For example, the Great China Match Company announced that each old share would receive five new shares and a dividend of thirteen yuan and twenty cents. The acquisition became even more enthusiastic, once again rising to an unprecedented high price of three hundred and ninety yuan. In the end, it returned slightly by five yuan, still rising by five yuan compared to the previous day. New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory, among the new pharmaceutical industries, also had a shareholder meeting today where old shareholders would have various preferential rights. Investors absorbed as much as possible, and the regular price rose from sixty-six yuan and a half to sixty-nine yuan and a half for the final transaction price, a rise of one yuan and a half. There were buyers above seventy yuan later, but sellers disappeared, and the rising momentum was the sharpest. The Sino-Western Pharmacy did business at four hundred and seventy-five yuan, then seventy yuan, an increase of ten yuan. Minyi also rose one yuan to ninety-one yuan. Other stocks, however, fell amidst selling pressure. Sino-French Pharmacy fell to twenty-nine yuan. Xinyi was difficult to sell even at two hundred and sixty yuan. Star Perfume retreated to two hundred and thirty-two yuan and a half. The cultural industry Jiu Jue softened. Gao Wu Zhonghua stepped lower and did not return, falling by five yuan to two yuan and a half. The world retreated to one hundred and five yuan, then seven yuan, still down slightly by three yuan. The department store industry fell in many lots. The National Goods Company broke through eighty yuan and finally returned to the checkpoint. Innerwear fell by one yuan to around thirty-three yuan. Wing On retreated to one hundred and thirty-three to four yuan, while Sincere fell by one yuan and a half to three yuan, which was inconsistent. Wing On Textile fell slightly by fifteen yuan to around one thousand nine hundred yuan. Small-denomination tickets tended to be sluggish and flat. Rongfeng rose to over fifty yuan, and the family industry traded at five hundred and twenty-five yuan. In the public utilities sector, Zhabei Water and China Electric Power both fell first and then returned, each rising slightly by one yuan. Other stocks were flat. The list is shown below:</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Tend to Soften</h3>
<p>Government bonds are sluggish and gradually soften, first because there is no 'formal market' and cannot be circulated, and second because of the approaching year-end and tight credit. Therefore, only a very small number of speculators who want to maintain their livelihood rely on the current market. Therefore, the range of price fluctuations is also extremely limited. Even the price that is done is not enough to represent the value of the government bond. Yesterday, Type C initially traded at seven yuan and then retreated to six yuan and thirty-four cents. Type A and E had no market, Type B was five yuan and fifty-six cents, and Type D was only three yuan and fifty-six cents. At this year-end period, the futures market is also trending towards dispersion, let alone during this controlled period. Therefore, transactions are also extremely small.</p>
<h3>Although Cloth Sales Are Weak, Prices Are Rising, Peach Blossom Lady Forest is Sturdier</h3>
<p>The factory cloth market yesterday still felt quiet in terms of actual sales transactions. However, the goods registered by the industry are not being sold loosely, so the market has turned upward. White goods, coarse and fine cloth, have generally called for higher prices of one or two yuan per piece. Colored goods are even more stable. Peach Blossom Lady Forest Factory's single price is two hundred and ninety-eight yuan, and the spot price is three hundred and five yuan, with no place to find it.</p>
<p>East Piece: Transactions are still rare, and prices have risen. The 12-pound Dragon Head Fine China Banking list rose from 192 yuan to 195 yuan and 5 cents. The Dragon Head New Factory list is 194 yuan and 5 cents, Rainbow Ball is 195 yuan, and Flying Fish Yang Crane and Horns are all about 194 yuan, up to three yuan. Four Gentlemen Biji Hongdan 7 yuan 6 cents 1 and a half points, made to 7 yuan 6 cents half, Banking list 7 yuan 7 cents.</p>
<h3>Horse Mane Satin Willing to Sell Cheap</h3>
<p>Unwilling to store until this day next year. The weather has been cold in recent days, and the business of various coats has increased, and the sales of horse mane satin needed for sleeve affairs have been very prosperous. The selling price is far more flat and tired than woolen goods. Yesterday, the horse mane satin woven with gold yarn was wholesaled at nine yuan to twelve yuan and fifty cents per yard. Artificial silk intertwined horse mane satin was wholesaled at eighteen yuan to twenty-seven yuan and fifty cents per yard. The reason for its smooth sales and flat price is that the production and storage are full, and if you want to turn around and need money, you are willing to sell at cost or at a slight loss. Once the father is over the winter, the actual sales will pass, and the cargo owner is unwilling to store it until this day next year.</p>
<h3>Ornamental Gold Internal Disk Weak, Dismantling Interest Rises to Two Corners</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the municipal silver building industry, Dashin peers jewelry gold door market was still suspended at three thousand three hundred and fifty yuan per tael (receipt decreased by about two hundred and fifty yuan), and the unofficial market price of peers inherited the fatigue of the previous day and turned downward. Jin Bang sold out, and the entrants waited and watched. The morning was three thousand two hundred and eighty yuan, twenty yuan lower. In the situation of little supply and less demand, the noon retreated to three thousand two hundred and fifty yuan, fifty yuan lower than the previous day. The afternoon was even more virtual, retreating to three thousand two hundred yuan. The price of jewelry patterned silver is still sixteen yuan per tael, and Hengfu hangs two yuan less, which is also sixteen yuan. The price of peers is between eighteen and a half yuan and nineteen yuan.</p>
<p>The Money Industry Association's dismantling interest was raised by three points to two corners.</p>
<p>The Japanese military ticket is still little changed, and the inter-peer price is between five yuan, five corners, five points, three five percent. The silver number and the small money bank door market buys in at five corners and four points and sells out six points.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains Transaction Bean Cakes Are More</h3>
<p>Yesterday's miscellaneous grain transaction, with bean cake as the bulk price, was firm because fertilization and edible digestion are both good. Bean sales were rare and prices were flat. It is planned to open more than 20 bags of Chongming Shayuan, priced at 309 yuan, and 20 bags of Sha Chih, priced at 338 yuan, 4 trucks of Fei Zi bean cakes, priced at 80 yuan and 05 cents to 83 yuan and 5 cents, a truck of Yuanlong bean cakes, priced at 83 yuan, and 500 pieces of Yuan Ji bean cakes, priced at 80 yuan and 05 cents.</p>
<h3>Persimmon Cakes Opening Price Rises Again</h3>
<p>Recently, persimmon cakes have continued to arrive at a higher cost, so all parties have held back and sold less. Yesterday, the Nanshi store opened up to fifteen yuan more than before, but compared to the price in Nanjing, it is much inferior.</p>
<h3>Black Date Market is Very Firm</h3>
<p>The black date market is still tight. Yesterday, the stores opened more than 150 pieces, the goods were better, and the identity was very dry. The price of Tianjin Regulation was 750 yuan, and the strength of the market has clearly improved in recent days. The market image is very firm.</p>
<h3>Mandarin Orange Cakes Only Arrived Ten Pieces</h3>
<p>The former goods of Bridge Cake have long been opened up. Although there are continuous arrivals from the stores, the number is only 10 pieces, and the cost of external fees has increased in addition to the cost, which is higher than before, so the asking price is also higher than before. Approximately, it can be transferred to the warehouse in a few days, so there is a real disk.</p>
<h3>Tinplate and Hui Si Tin, None Will Be Out of Stock</h3>
<p>The tinplate market has been short for a long time. Whether it is 90 pounds, 100 pounds, single-linked small tinplate, 180 pounds, 200 pounds of tinplate, 24 pounds, 26 pounds of large tinplate, or even 200 pounds of Hui Si tin, 200 pounds of cyan lead double-linked boards, etc., there are worries that the spot goods will be out of stock. Therefore, although the market wants to buy, it is affected by the thin circulation of goods, and it encounters walls everywhere and it is difficult to make a deal. The market situation has not been able to become lively, and it is mostly a situation of having a market but no market. Yesterday, the market price of each single-linked tinplate box was 1200 yuan, and each double-speed iron box was 2200 yuan, and Hui Si tin was 1750 yuan.</p>

<h3>Historical Traces of Public Utilities in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Bai Hong</p>
<p>After reading the article "The Import of Western Civilization into Shanghai" on the 14th, anyone with a historical hobby will be very interested. However, what is mentioned is only railways, telegraphs, telephones, and electric lights. Now, based on what is known, I will add some other historical traces of public utilities. The accusation of adding superfluous details is not counted.</p>
<p>Trams: The public concession opened on March 5, 1908 (34th year of Guangxu). The French concession opened earlier in February. At that time, the fee per stop was only one copper coin. The Nanshi system started operating in August 1914 (3rd year of the Republic of China).</p>
<p>Trolleybuses: The public concession started operating in November 1924 (13th year of the Republic of China). The French concession started operating in August 1926 (15th year of the Republic of China).</p>
<p>Public buses: The public concession also started operating in mid-October 1924 (13th year of the Republic of China). The French concession started operating in February 1927 (16th year of the Republic of China). Nanshi Zhabei started operating in June and November of the 17th year, respectively.</p>
<p>Double-decker buses started operating in the public concession on April 1, 1934.</p>
<p>Automatic telephones were installed in the concession starting in 1926 (15th year of the Republic of China). The urban area was changed in the 20th year.</p>
<p>International wireless telegraphs: The Zhenru Radio Station was completed in November 1930 (19th year of the Republic of China). In December, it communicated with Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>Civil aviation: Flights started in November 1929 (18th year of the Republic of China). The first route was Shanghai to Hankou.</p>

<h3>Listening to the Huangzhong Society's Broadcast</h3>
<p>— Lawrence</p>
<p>The Shanghai Catholic authorities have recently been actively organizing various undertakings to promote the true meaning of Catholicism. At 6:30 PM on the 13th of this month, the Catholic Huangzhong Broadcasting Society broadcast speeches, songs, and plays at the Xaviai Road Cultural Radio Station. The author is purely a listener, and I will publish what I have heard to the newspaper to share with readers who have not listened.</p>
<p>The topic of the speech was "Catholicism and Science," and it was given by Professor Tu Renzheng of the Department of Physics and Chemistry of Aurora University. Professor Wang is rich in academics, and the content of his speech is quite valuable. Generally speaking, it is a historical story about the progress of European science and the relationship between Catholicism. When Professor Wang spoke, it was a bit like a reminder during meditation.</p>
<p>The singing was broadcast by the Ciyouhui Choir. According to what I know, the association regards music as a major subject, and the members are quite cultivated. The singing is so divine and humanized that it is not without the feeling of wanting to become immortal, especially the third song Magnum Agnum, which is sung by four parts.</p>
<p>The drama is a real story from a certain place in England, and the title of the play is "Starlight on the Lake," which is a short play with deep poetic meaning. This time the society broadcast, the piano at the beginning played quite appropriately, which set off the tranquility of Xingyi Lake. On the part of the drama actors, it is relatively naive: The first is the drama of "Shanghai Bai", which is not very palatable, and the second is the ups and downs of the drama words, because the relationship of using "Shanghai Bai" is difficult to show; and there are also many "Xu Jiagui Township tones" in the oral force surface, such as "It's me (me)", "It's you (you)", "It's him (him)", etc., which are quite unpleasant to listen to. In other aspects, such as using several different songs to accompany the feelings, the whistle when the ship arrives at the port, etc., are all applied very successfully, which is worth mentioning. In summary, the society's broadcast of dramas is still the first time, and it is worthy of admiration and praise to have such achievements. Judging from the observation of the radio drama scene, its achievements are also above the standard, which is undeniable. (Thanks for the reward)</p>
<h3>Riding the Storm Together</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>One or Two. Backyard Flowers</p>
<p>Wei Cheng and Huang Long returned to the Wang Shunxing Inn. The gambling game in the inn had already dispersed, and the energetic Wang Madman was not seen sitting at the account table. Wei Cheng closed the door and tapped the table lightly: tapping is to express anger, tapping lightly is to prevent other guests in the next room from hearing it. Then he sighed and said, "It's over, it's over." Huang Long said, "It's not for nothing, it won't be wrong, Cheng Bingzhun is that old woman's son." Wei Cheng said, "How can it not be for nothing? Cheng is indeed Chen's old lady's son, and Chen's old lady is indeed Cheng's old lady, and even if Chen's old lady denies it, it is trying to cover it up. But what about Cheng? Isn't Cheng dead? I want to avenge my parents, but the enemy is already dead. You say what a painful thing this is?" Huang Long stared at his eyes and clenched his fists, and the joints of his bones rattled, and smiled: "Maybe they are full of tricks: Cheng is really not dead, coaxing us, even if he is dead, let us die to kill him." Huang Long was also clever, and said the word "kill" lightly.</p>
<p>Wei Cheng groaned for a while and said, "This will not happen: you are daydreaming. How do they know that we have already discovered that Cheng is Chen's old lady's son? Since they don't know, there is no need to coax us, so I say you are daydreaming, and you are also neurotic." Huang Long nodded. While nodding, he hurriedly drew a white, shiny silver-like short knife from under the mattress, raised his trousers legs, stuffed it into the sock, and several blue veins suddenly burst out on his white face. Wei Cheng panicked and said, "What are you doing?" Huang Long said, "Don't ask me now, just sleep in the quilt, and I'll be back in a while. I often hear storytellers talk about warming wine and beheading Hua Xiong, and Guan Yunchang hadn't cooled a cup of wine when he came back from beheading Hua. I'll pour a cup of tea here now, and go and behead that old undead woman, and the tea will surely not cool. Don't plead for that old woman to me. I see that the old woman's breathing and breathing is not good for a few days. If I don't do it, when she dies, I won't be able to do anything about it, then it won't be good." After Huang Long finished speaking, he didn't wait for Wei Cheng to answer, opened the door and ran out. (244)</p>
<h3>A Retrospective of the Malayan Defeat (6)</h3>
<p>— Notes of General Percival, Former Commander of the British Army in Malaya</p>
<p>February 10 (Tuesday), resolved to withdraw part of the 18th Division to reinforce the troops. By the morning of the 21st (Wednesday), most of the reserve forces had been deployed. Losing the Bukit Timah racecourse, we tried our best to maintain the safety of the positions near Adam Road. February 12 (Thursday), the entire 18th Division had to retreat from the northern region. Also: (1) The 11th Indian Division retreated from the naval base area. (2) The troops in the Strong Base and Southeast Coast area also retreated on February 12 (Thursday). In this way, by the 13th (Friday), new positions had been built in the areas around the city of Singapore, Karang airfield, Bedadari, MacRitchie Reservoir, Adam, Road, and Alexander. February 14 (Saturday), due to bombing and shelling, the water pipes were almost completely destroyed, and the water supply in Singapore was extremely difficult. By the morning of the 15th (Sunday), the water supply situation deteriorated further, causing experts to declare that there was only one day and night of water supply left. This was the biggest reason we decided to surrender on the 15th.</p>
<p>Air Situation</p>
<p>The above review barely touches on the air situation. Not only the British army, but also the Japanese authorities did not understand this situation. Britain could not send the necessary air force to Malaya because it had other tasks in other areas. From the first few days, the Japanese army gained complete air superiority and never lost it until the end. This was a very troublesome thing for us, especially in coastal operations, we could not act freely, and we were not afraid that information would be leaked to the Japanese army. Also, operations in the Singapore area were also significantly affected. That is to say, the repair of airfields, the operation of shipyards, etc. were very inconvenient.</p>
<p>(Note) Because the air force is independent of the army, specialized matters concerning the air force will not be discussed here.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Japanese Army's Victory</p>
<p>The biggest factor in the Japanese army's success lies in the speed of its advance. This speed was caused by the following reasons. (1) The Japanese army has the possibility of living in this place for longer than the US military. (2) Because of the above reasons, the Japanese army does not have to rely entirely on road traffic. (3) The Japanese army can quickly pass through obstacles such as rivers and swamps, and can quickly repair damage. (4) The Japanese army is full of endurance. (End)</p>
