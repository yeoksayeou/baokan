<p>— 鐵明</p>
<p>第二天，天還未大亮，我們叉上道了。我還是不肯坐在前面，但後面佈置得好多了，所以震動得幷不十分厲害。過了寶立尼（ｏｌｉｇｎｙ）約五十公里，在一個很荒凉的地方，我下車了。仍舊編着故事，說我打算步行，經聖喬治山峽，（Ｃｏｌ　ｄｅ　Ｓｔ　Ｇｅｏｒｇｅｓ）進瑞士去，差不多一天的路程。我們於是說着再會，祝着順利而分手了。但是我實在的行程剛巧和我所說的相反，繞着小路往法國中部走去。</p>
<p>一面走一面考應這個局面。維護會一定以爲馬丁已把海水鍊金的全部秘密連製造金媒的方法統統告訴了我。至少我對於這件事已知梗概，有被殺滅口的資格了。倘使維延德門的炸彈冉遲到五分鐘，也許我就可以明瞭他們到底還是要大量裝造黃金呢，還是祗要防止別人用這個方法來和他鬥金鑛爭利。我想起來第二說似乎蚊爲近情，因爲即使他們要大量製金，其結果終必和李感們一樣，決難長期保守秘密的；他們大概只想把我謀殺了之後就希望再也沒有別人知道有海水鍊金的方法。根據這個理想，我決計把這次經過全部公開發表，讓他們知道我幷未完全明白這個方法，所以也就沒有費手脚謀害我的必要。而爲避免嫌疑起見，我以後決不在近海的地方買地產，也不再到海邊去避暑。</p>
<p>我現在把這次經過的詳情在中國和英國的普通刊物上發表。在英國發表，可以讓維護會的耳目早早見到；在中國發表，可以使我的家族親友們知道我的處境，趕緊使駐外大使館注意，和給我必要的營救。一大半的讀者當然把我的記載看做一篇小說，但是倘使我在歐洲被殺了或者同葛樂華一樣地被誣害了，那麽世界人士—尤其是學術界的人士—都會明白我所叙述的一切全是事實，而知道我是一個爲科學而犧牲者。</p>
<p>維護會和法國警察大概都追踪著我。法國邊境和英法交通綫一定被嚴密注意着，牛津大學大概更不免。但他們再聰明也決想不到我會把二十世紀最重要的科學發明去登載在普通刊物上的。我這篇實錄是在　文省（Ａｎｖｅｒｇｎｅ）一個古老小鎭中寫成的，同時我儘量改變我的形跡，護照已寄給章先生請他代爲保存，叉在路上把小提包向人交換了一個旅行帆布背包；幾天來，我的鬍于巳長得很長，非但使人家不易認識我，而且我的剃刀也賣了十五法郎</p>
<p>身邊的錢一天天少下去，可是不能叫英國方面或章先生匯錢給我，因爲領款時必需證明我的姓甚名誰，而這是目前最危臉不過的。現在我非儘量節省不可，而且還是設法找些進款。有一天一輛汽車在公路上「拋錨」了，我幫那旅客提一個小箱子到近邊一個小村裏，賺了五法郎。沒有錢，在法國是無法生活的，非想辦法不可！</p>
<p>這篇記載未發表之前，隨時可以發生性命之憂。前天我還看見一個人跟隨着我，我拚命跑過一個小山頭纔走脫了。我不信維護會能有這許多爪牙，而那人對我瞪眼也許因爲我容貌古怪服裝不整潔而覺得詫異而巳。可是我寗可草木皆兵，實在不敢放心托大。</p>
<p>我的計劃是把這篇文字寄出之後到盎貝爾去用我最後三十法郎喝一個爛醉如泥，當地警察一定把我請進地方監獄。這種辦法深合我意，因爲監獄是在法國不必費錢而能生活的惟一地方，而且還可以得到充分的安全，不必再憂慮維護會的陰謀。我並不一定喜歡法國的監獄生活，拘役尤爲難堪，但總比踏上馬　的覆轍好得多了。我打算供稱荷蘭籍，叫做康寗（Ｋｏｎｉｎｇ）；身邊旣無荷蘭護照，叉是不名一文，荷蘭文只會幾句，我想附近的荷蘭領事決不肯收　我的。於是我就可以在無人注意的盎貝爾地方監獄裏從從容容地坐等這篇文字的發表和大使館或章先生拿着我的護照和錢來救我出獄。我希望印刷所不要怕排外國字的麻煩，這裏所註的洋文人名地名都是將來營救我的時候極有用處的，性命攸關，千萬不可刪去或排錯！倘使到那時盎貝爾地方監獄裏竟尋不出一個自稱康寗而留有長　子的犯人，那麽大　我竟來不及實行我的計劃　在得到監獄的保護之前，已先得到了和馬丁李感葛樂華同一的命運</p>
<p>這篇記載發表之後；結果如何呢？我猜想維護會一定明白如果我會製造金媒，我決不肯把這秘密這樣和盤托出的。他們如果把我殺害了，那就等於不打自招，坐實了他們謀害馬丁李感葛樂華的罪狀。我想他們決不致如此憑蠢！他們一定只希望讀者不相信我的記載，在不認識我的人只當一篇小說看；而在認識我的人呢，也許以爲是一個敎授在法　酗酒入獄後自己解嘲的把戲吧！可是天下之大，一定有幾個有見識的人知道我這篇報告在科學上的價値。不多幾年一定會有人在什麼地方應用　樂華的方法製造黃金，而謀害我們的那夥壞傢伙，也可以以覺悟阻止科學的前進是一種徒勞無功的反動行爲。五六個有相當浩詣的數理學家合作起來不難在四五年內把製造金媒所必需解答的方程式全都計算出來，所以在六七年之後我要勸告有資產的親友們，把所有公債和金鑛股票趕快賣出，改買別種企業的股票。但是蘇聯有不少很好的數理家，如果他們着手硏究這個方法，每年將不　有五十萬萬羅布以上的金子做世界革命的經費。果眞如此，無論買什麼股票也許都沒有什麽用處了。（全篇完）</p>

<h3 id="c55">我怎樣編導「若蘭怨」 <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— 林諷葊</p>
<p>若蘭怨的故事，完全取材於蘇蕙迥文錦詩。四年前，我在雷台播音講過，同時曾經把　文詩編成一本夫婦入生哲學。這也許廣東同鄉們不至於淡忘罷。</p>
<p>我寫本劇的動機，因爲蘇蕙的人格學問，的確使人太感動了。所謂「臨　端幹。術霜振葉」。缺乏了這種人格思想的人，在社會上，沒有不失敗的。在若蘭怨一劇本中，第一幕暴露了蘇蕙的短處；一言以蔽之，就是性急而傷妬」。本來這種毛病，是古今中外女子的通病，根本就不單是蘇蕙一個人。尤其是在封建時代的中國，簡直是司空見慣。不過蘇蕙却不幸代表了一般婦女的典型而已！因此在第一幕發覺竇滔金屋藏嬌的所在時，就强調了道一個氣氛。</p>
<p>至於趙陽臺身份的介紹，也在第一慕詩情畫意中，造成一個浮雕的印象，一方面反映出蘇若闌的人格與地位。</p>
<p>竇滔固然是一個風流才子，他的　蹟雖然不及孫克咸的轟烈，但祇要看武則天的蘇蕙傳中，「風神秀偉，該通經史尤文允武，　論尚之」四句，便知道究竟是個甚麼人物了，以如此出色當行的人物自然够得上名士風流的資格，所以我在第一幕中，也略略把上文四句的倫廓，給他描摹出來了。不過貪圖富貴，急功好利，這也是他的一生短處，一裏陽，安南將軍」，接旨後的一笑，却把竇滔的心事，曲曲傳出。</p>
<p>故事展開以後，自然最大的高潮，就是主題素材的「　文錦詩」，但是該詩原文，深奧玄妙，而目句法字義，參差錯落，是純文藝的作品，要把它成爲通俗化，且不失題材眞義。第三幕夢景的處理和璇璣圖的介紹，就是根據上述方法寫成的第二幕的高潮有了，第四幕更難下筆，因爲故事上悲劇的氣氛，在第四幕的歷史題村，幾乎找不出一點來。</p>
<p>至於導演方面，也發生過不少困難，幸而結果終於克服了。因爲我這回是希望實現我十餘年「改良粵劇和方言話劇一的理想，所以這回冶歌舞話劇粵劇青華於一爐，的確是一種一大胆的嘗試。</p>
<p>末了。得向諸君說明的，本劇的主旨，是指導夫婦人生的大道，希望收獲「樂而不淫，哀而不傷」的效果的。至於成功與否，這裹不敢自詡，誠懇地請大家予以批評指敎，不勝厚幸。</p>

<p>— 星岩</p>
<p>中華劇校成立僅八閱月，日前余往黃金覜其第一日彩排戲碼共有大賜福，草橋關，吊龜，昭關，搖錢樹（即張四姐下凡）四郎探母六齣，是夕天氣炎熱，而上座竟十二成，樓上下凳子均加滿，盛况可謂空前矣。兒童演戲與大班逈乎不同。蓋大班只着重每一劇中之主角。而小科班則人人皆有精彩，甚至一龍套一物形（即飾猪羊等者）均精神抖擻，無敢稍懈，只整齊莊嚴四字即能使·觀衆滿意，而小兒之活潑天眞與塲面之偉大齊一，尤足使人精神煥發。即如大賜福一劇，若大班演之，則無甚意味，今中華劇校增加雲童二十餘人帶跑雲及汗子奪魁諸塲即鬧忙多多。草橋關之大面，吊龜之老旦，昭關之老生，天賦皆極佳，吃調均在正宮以上，嗓音寬亮，尤屬難得，將來甚有希望。搖錢樹之武旦，刀花熟極，扮相亦美，打出手時雖有一；處失手，惟均在不重要處，而丟　鞭換雙槍及反脚踢花槍等極險極難之出手，反穩當之極，觀衆彩聲雷動，以十三四歲之女生而有如此工夫，洵足使人驚服也。大軸探母，配搭勻整，行頭嶄然一新，甚爲壯覜。該校於公演之前，先能以慈善爲懷，以如此炎夏，任此義舉，足證該校師生之熱心社會事業矣。</p>
<p>（編者按）中華國劇學校慈善彩排之第三晚，余應友人之邀，會往參觀，至則目蓮救母，捉放曹，巳演畢，接演樊江關，二進宮，及楊排風三劇，塲面壯麗，聲容並茂，諸生正在童年，長者十三四，幼者八九歲，而演來一絲不苟，頭頭是道，無論唱做說百，俱相當嫻熟，觀者稱善，彩聲小絕。以八個月之訓練，居然獲此成績，足見敎學努力，洵難能可貴者矣。</p>
<h3 id="c58">告擬搬演「秋海棠」者 <a href="#c58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— 施明揚</p>
<p>「秋海棠」在本報連續登載的時候，我已看過一遍，單行本出版後，我又細細謂了兩遍；就小說論小說，的確是近年來很難得的一部創作。故中中間雖然同樣有軍閥，有戲子，有姨太太，可是結構非常特別，意識和技巧，也比一般以同、樣題材寫成的小說好得多，尤其是改寫以後的那個結束，更有回味不盡的妙處。</p>
<p>現在聽說中聯製片公司巳決定把它搬上銀幕，由馬徐維邦自編自導，同時排演話劇的消息，也鬧得很響。據說某導演確然也是有意一試的，僅僅因爲書中的兩個男主角——秋海棠與趙玉崑——不容易我到適當的演員，唯恐失敗，所以到現在還沒有決定。</p>
<p>這倒眞是搬演　秋海棠一書的最大困難，在銀幕上，也許還可以想出一種取巧的方法來解決，但在舞台上却就大成問題了。因爲秋海棠是全書的主角，演得好，全劇才有生氣，演得不好，就可以因爲個人的失敗而使全劇失敗。現在上海的話劇界裏，優秀的男演員比女演員少得多，尤其像秋海棠這種個性（堅忍沉毅）更不容易做得好，譬如像石揮和黃宗江兩位，演技都非常洗鍊，讓他們飾演秋海棠，在毀容以後是一定可以成功的，但爲了耍增加悲劇的氛圍起見，未毀容　的秋海棠，必須以美少年，和名旦的態度出現，這和黃石兩位就不大相官了。並且趙玉崑那樣有血性，有義氣，而行動又十分滑稽活潑的角色，也不容易找到適當的人。</p>
<p>至於劇本的改編，委實也不是一件容易的事，像這種偏重於心理描寫的長篇巨著是極容易使編劇人失敗的，囂俄的名著、孤星淚」在銀慕上所演出的遠不如原書精采，便是一個實例。所以編劇人在著手改編以前，至少得鄭車攷　，並多多徵求讀者意見，才不致白費一番心血。</p>
<p>我是很願意看到這部戲的人，而且十分肯定地相信，假使劇本編得好，演員支配得適當，這部戲是必然可以成功的</p>

<p>爲了翠珍失踪，又爲了强盜上鬥目的並不在乎財物，維城就想着了費長河。他站在天井一　把雙手反剪着，向前走了兩步，就往後退却一步，忽的把手掌拍在大腿上道：「一定是他，一定是他！」喜鵲少見多怪，忙報告葉二太太說；「少爺一個人在說話。葉二太太走到天井裏，見維城巳經走出大門，就喚道：「維城，你往那裹去？」維城站定了，附在葉二太太耳畔，嘁嘁喳喳說了幾句。葉二太太道：「算來是不會的吧，費長河，我們沒待錯他，他不會這樣做，翠珍也沒待錯他，他也不會對翠珍這樣做。」維城道·「我想冷不防往費長河家裹去看一看，如果是他把翠珍姊搶了去的，我不問靑紅皂白，一把胸脯抓住了他，近，鄉裏，遠，城裏，隨便到那裏去都可以。」葉二太太連忙把維城一攔，又遠遠的喚阿興關了籬門，然後對維城道：「我的膽子，幾次給你嚇得小之又小了。費長河家裏是一個是非門，他這種人，又生成的是一個惡棍，一個賭徒，你怎麽到他家裏去？現在，凡是你想去的地方，可以讓阿興去，何子興去。就是你不要去。一</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Battle of Stalingrad Enters a Decisive Phase: German Forces Advance on the City in Two Pincers, Another Route Pushes Towards the Black Sea Coast <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Allied News Agency) - General Bock's mechanized forces, after crossing the Don River northwest of Stalingrad, have overcome fierce Soviet resistance and are advancing on Stalingrad, a major city on the Volga River producing tanks. Official announcements here remain tight-lipped about the specifics of the battle, but indicate that fierce fighting is taking place in the narrow strip of land between the Don and Volga rivers. The Battle of Stalingrad has entered a decisive phase. German forces are attacking the city in two directions. No new information has been received from the southern route in Kotelnikovo, only that German forces have driven a wedge deep into Soviet positions, and fierce fighting is taking place in that area. As for the German offensive against Soviet Black Sea positions, the German command has not provided detailed reports, only that German forces are rapidly advancing towards the coast, making the situation of Novorossiysk, the base of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet, even more critical.</p>
<p>Hitler's Headquarters, 25th (Haitong News Agency) - Today's German war report stated that Romanian forces have occupied Temryuk, a port at the mouth of the Kuban River. South of the lower reaches of the Kuban River, enemy forces launched several counter-attacks, all of which were repulsed, and the enemy was forced to retreat deep into the mountains. German mountain troops have occupied several key passes in the western Caucasus Mountains. At 11:00 AM on the 21st of this month, a team of mountain troops climbed the highest peak of the Caucasus (Mount Elbrus, 5,661 meters above sea level) and hoisted the German flag. Northwest and south of Stalingrad, despite the Soviets' valiant resistance, German forces continue to advance. 52 Soviet tanks were destroyed. On the Don front, Italian forces engaged in several hand-to-hand combat with the invading enemy, eventually repelling them. German planes bombed Stalingrad day and night, causing fires at several factories and other military facilities. Two transport ships were sunk in the Volga River. Southwest of Kaluga and northwest of Medyn, enemy aircraft attacks failed. In Rzhev, German forces engaged in fierce fighting with enemy infantry and tank formations, destroying 63 Soviet tanks. Southeast of Lake Ilmen and near Leningrad, only localized fighting occurred. Yesterday, German planes attacked the Soviet White Sea port of Arkhangelsk, causing several major fires.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 25th (Havas News Agency) - August 24, 1942, will be one of the most important days in world history. On this day, German forces began a general offensive against the central and vital points of the outer defenses of Stalingrad. For the past 24 hours, German light tanks, field artillery, and infantry units have been continuously crossing the Don River on pontoon bridges or being transported by barges. There are two important crossing points: one at Verkhny Chir, 37 miles northwest of Stalingrad. It is thought that the German forces crossing at the former location have already cut off the railway line connecting Stalingrad to Moscow, as this railway runs parallel to the Don River in several sections. The German offensive against Stalingrad this time still takes the form of a familiar pincer movement. One pincer is at Kachalinskaya in the north, and the other is at Abganerovo in the west. Both locations are the same distance from Stalingrad. The German army has an advantage in both manpower and tanks, and its air force is also very fierce. Fortifications around Stalingrad are being heavily bombed. Fortifications are heavily concentrated along the route from the Don to the Volga River, but the distance between the two rivers is not far, approximately 30 to 38 miles. According to German authorities, the fate of Stalingrad should be decided within this week. German newspapers also record that after the German forces reach the mouth of the Volga River, they will have reached "the natural boundary between Europe and Asia," and it seems that they will not advance any further for the time being.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 25th (Haitong News Agency) - BBC commentator Hale said today, "If we are still unaware of the plight of Soviet forces in the Caucasus and refuse to acknowledge that the German advance towards the Caucasus can be compared to the worst periods in France and Ukraine, then we are all blind. A certain member of the Communist Party's Central Committee warned the Soviet people on the radio that if the Germans conquer the Caucasus, the impact on the Soviet Union will be very significant. During the First World War, all of Europe opposed Germany, but today Germany can exert its full power in the eastern war and possesses the potential of the entire European economy and labor force. Now that German forces are only 40 to 50 miles from Stalingrad, I believe there has been a new, and increasingly worse, change in the Soviet war effort. This new change is enough to increase the difficulties of the war, and I believe the most difficult training period has arrived."</p>

<p>Berlin, 24th (Havas News Agency) - Regarding Brazil's declaration of war against Germany and Italy, the German Foreign Ministry commented that Brazil has become a slave to the United States. From a military point of view, Brazil's participation in the war is not of great significance. From an economic point of view, the country's resources have long been at the disposal of the United States, so there will be no significant increase or decrease in the future. The German government is not surprised by Brazil's decision, because the country's government has been constantly taking actions that violate neutrality under the instigation of the enemy. The people of Brazil will one day demand that those who plunged the country into the vortex of war explain their reasons. As for the Brazilian authorities' claim that five of its ships have been sunk by Axis submarines, it is not true and is merely an excuse.</p>

<p>Washington, 24th (Havas News Agency) - Secretary of State Hull and British Ambassador to the United States Lord Halifax met for a long time today to discuss important issues between Britain and the United States and the backlog of cases during the British Ambassador's return to his country. Hull declined to announce details of the meeting. When reporters asked about Finnish Foreign Minister Tanner's statement that he did not want to negotiate a separate peace with the Soviet Union, he replied that the US government had not received any reports on this matter and therefore did not wish to criticize it.</p>
<p>British General Election Not to be Held Early</p>
<p>London, 25th (Havas News Agency) - It has been learned that Prime Minister Churchill recently made a short stay in Cairo during his trip to Moscow. It has also been announced here. The British government does not intend to hold the next general election early.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 25th (Haitong News Agency) - According to London news from Swedish newspapers, the date for Parliament to convene to hear Churchill's report on the Moscow Conference has not yet been determined. There is currently no immediate sign of a meeting being called. Churchill made a week's stop in Cairo after flying from Moscow and before arriving in London. Churchill traveled 15,000 miles on his round trip to Moscow.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 25th (Haitong News Agency) - According to a London dispatch from the "Daily News," there is very little news in London about the establishment of a new defense zone by British troops in Iran and Iraq, and the appointment of General Wilson as commander-in-chief of the zone. The development of this matter may be decided by the Moscow Conference, which is part of a joint British-Soviet strategy in the Caucasus. It is also rumored that former commander-in-chief of the Egyptian front, Auchinleck, will take an important position in the defense zone. It is almost certain that British troops will be sent to fight in the Caucasus, as the Soviets need war materials, not soldiers, so the Soviet Union has rejected the British suggestion. It seems possible that British forces will be responsible for supplying Soviet troops in the Caucasus. Therefore, the demarcation line between the British and Soviet armies will move north from south of Tehran. London has doubts about whether British troops will be able to carry out their responsibilities. London is also rumored to have landed US troops in Persian ports.</p>

<p>— Tie Ming</p>
<p>The next day, before dawn, we were on our way again. I still refused to sit in the front, but the back was much better arranged, so the jolting was not too severe. About fifty kilometers past Poligny, in a very desolate place, I got out of the car. I continued to make up a story, saying that I planned to walk through the Saint-Georges Gorge (Col de St. Georges) into Switzerland, which was about a day's journey. We then said goodbye, wished each other well, and parted ways. But my actual route was exactly the opposite of what I said, winding along small paths towards central France.</p>
<p>As I walked, I pondered the situation. The Maintenance Society must have thought that Martin had told me all the secrets of seawater alchemy, including the method of making gold mediums. At least I knew the general outline of the matter and was qualified to be silenced. If the Viyende Men's bomb had arrived five minutes later, perhaps I would have understood whether they still wanted to manufacture gold in large quantities, or whether they only wanted to prevent others from using this method to compete with them in the gold mining industry. I thought the second explanation seemed more plausible, because even if they wanted to produce gold in large quantities, the result would inevitably be the same as with Lee Gam, and it would be difficult to keep the secret for long. They probably only wanted to murder me and then hope that no one else would know about the method of seawater alchemy. Based on this idea, I decided to publish the entire experience, letting them know that I did not fully understand the method, so there was no need to bother murdering me. And to avoid suspicion, I would never buy real estate near the sea in the future, nor would I go to the beach for summer vacation again.</p>
<p>I am now publishing the details of this experience in common Chinese and English publications. Publishing it in England will allow the Maintenance Society's ears and eyes to see it early; publishing it in China will allow my family and friends to know my situation, quickly alerting the embassies abroad to pay attention and provide me with necessary rescue. Most readers will, of course, regard my account as a novel, but if I am killed in Europe or falsely accused like Ge Lehua, then the people of the world—especially those in academic circles—will understand that everything I have described is true, and that I am a victim who has sacrificed for science.</p>
<p>The Maintenance Society and the French police are probably tracking me. The French border and the Anglo-French transportation lines must be under close surveillance, and Oxford University is probably no exception. But no matter how clever they are, they would never imagine that I would publish the most important scientific invention of the twentieth century in common publications. This true account was written in Anvergne, an ancient small town. At the same time, I tried my best to change my appearance. I had already sent my passport to Mr. Zhang to keep it for me. I also exchanged my small handbag for a travel canvas backpack on the road. For the past few days, my beard has grown very long, not only making it difficult for people to recognize me, but I also sold my razor for fifteen francs.</p>
<p>The money on hand is decreasing day by day, but I can't ask the British side or Mr. Zhang to send me money, because it is necessary to prove my name when receiving the money, and this is the most dangerous thing at the moment. Now I must save as much as possible and still find ways to earn some money. One day, a car "broke down" on the highway. I helped the traveler carry a small box to a nearby village and earned five francs. Without money, it is impossible to live in France, so I must find a way!</p>
<p>Before this account is published, there is always a risk to my life. The day before yesterday, I saw someone following me. I ran desperately over a small hill to escape. I don't believe the Maintenance Society could have so many henchmen, and that person's staring at me was perhaps because he was surprised by my strange appearance and untidy clothes. But I would rather be overly cautious and dare not take it lightly.</p>
<p>My plan is to send out this text and then go to Ambert to spend my last thirty francs on getting completely drunk. The local police will definitely invite me into the local prison. This method is very agreeable to me, because prison is the only place in France where you can live without spending money, and you can also get complete safety, without having to worry about the Maintenance Society's conspiracy. I don't necessarily like French prison life, and detention is particularly difficult, but it is much better than following in Martin's footsteps. I plan to claim Dutch nationality and call myself Koning. Since I have no Dutch passport and am penniless, and only know a few sentences of Dutch, I don't think the nearby Dutch consul would be willing to take me in. Then I can wait calmly in the unnoticed Ambert local prison for the publication of this text and for the embassy or Mr. Zhang to come and rescue me from prison with my passport and money. I hope the printing house will not be afraid of the trouble of typesetting foreign words. The foreign names of people and places noted here are extremely useful for rescuing me in the future. Lives are at stake, so please do not delete or misspell them! If, by that time, no prisoner claiming to be Koning and with a long beard can be found in the Ambert local prison, then it would be that I did not even have time to implement my plan and had already met the same fate as Martin, Lee Gam, and Ge Lehua before obtaining the protection of the prison.</p>
<p>What will be the result after this account is published? I guess the Maintenance Society will understand that if I could make gold mediums, I would never reveal the secret so completely. If they kill me, it would be tantamount to admitting their guilt in murdering Martin, Lee Gam, and Ge Lehua. I don't think they would be so foolish! They must only hope that readers do not believe my account, and that those who do not know me will regard it as a novel; and those who know me may think it is a professor's trick to excuse himself after getting drunk and imprisoned in France! But in this vast world, there must be some insightful people who know the scientific value of my report. In a few years, someone will definitely use Ge Lehua's method to make gold somewhere, and those bad guys who murdered us may also realize that it is futile and reactionary to prevent the progress of science. Five or six mathematicians and physicists with considerable attainments, working together, should not find it difficult to calculate all the equations necessary for making gold mediums within four or five years. Therefore, in six or seven years, I want to advise my wealthy relatives and friends to quickly sell all their government bonds and gold mining stocks and buy stocks in other enterprises instead. But the Soviet Union has many good mathematicians, and if they start to study this method, they will not have less than 500 million rubles a year to use for the expenses of the world revolution. If that is the case, buying any stock may not be of any use. (The end of the whole article)</p>

<h3 id="e24">Responsible Parties Fully Mobilized for Patrol, Blackout Drill Last Night, Aircraft Surveyed and Circled Several Times, Street Lights All Extinguished Around 9 PM <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Last night's first blackout drill lasted for four hours, from 7:30 PM to 11:30 PM. Prior to the drill, the authorities of the two concessions temporarily posted notices, instructing citizens to completely cover indoor lights during the drill, so that they could not be seen from outside. Therefore, as soon as the drill began, the responsible parties patrolled the streets, and the situation was very tense. Vehicles on the street dimmed their lights or partially covered them with black cloth. Shops either closed early or turned off all advertising lights. Trams were covered with louvers, and all lights were turned off once they entered the depot. Therefore, the streets were half dark. After 9 PM, aircraft rumbled at a higher altitude, and many people looked up to watch. In addition, senior officials from the police departments of the two concessions, fire brigade personnel, and cadres from the health and public works departments all went out to inspect or conduct fire-fighting and rescue drills. At the same time, the newly established health committee of the Baojia Committee also set out to carry out rescue work. In yesterday's drill program, there were no obvious signs in the first hour because it was not dark. After 8 and 9 PM, the whole city seemed to be immersed in a serious atmosphere of air defense. Around 9:30, all the street lights were turned off, and the lights of thousands of homes were controlled. At 11 PM, the Greater East Asia Radio announced the end of the drill. The first blackout in this city ended.</p>
<p>Aircraft Drop Warning Signals</p>
<p>In addition, during the blackout drill last night, aircraft hovered and looked down, dropping signals on places that did not comply with the covering of lights. Areas such as Hongkou and West Shanghai were warned. As for the results of the drill, it remains to be announced.</p>
<p>Fire Occurs During Drill</p>
<p>At 8:26 last night, during the blackout drill in this city, a building in Lane 318, Wuchang Road, Hongkou, suddenly caught fire. Dense smoke spread immediately, and the fire blazed. The fire brigade drove to the scene to put out the fire. After about an hour and a half, the fire was extinguished. As a result, buildings at Nos. 121, 123, 125, and 127 were destroyed.</p>

<p>Continued exchange of evacuees between Japan and the American countries has been negotiated and settled. The Japanese mail ship Asama Maru and the Italian ship Conte Verde are expected to arrive in Shanghai from Yokohama on the 2nd of next month, berthing for several days. They will depart for Lourenço Marques in Africa around the 6th or 7th of the month. The two ships can carry a total of 1,500 evacuees, most of whom are ordinary overseas Chinese. Because diplomatic and consular officials have almost been evacuated in the past, the evacuees are not only limited to Shanghai. Japanese Americans should also be included. In principle, the next batch of American evacuees from Shanghai will be more than those evacuated from Japan. In addition to mainly American people, it will also extend to people from Canada, South America, and Central America.</p>
<p>Those Without Serious Illnesses Must Be Evacuated</p>
<p>The American Association of Shanghai continued to process the registration of overseas Chinese yesterday, with a deadline at the end of the month. Yesterday, it also notified all American people in Shanghai, informing them of the possibility of evacuation in early next month, but instructed them not to constantly inquire about information from the Association or the Swiss Consulate before the overall situation is completely clarified. The notice stated that all American overseas Chinese who have the right to evacuate and are healthy enough to withstand long journeys are expected to leave Shanghai. If there are serious illnesses that make it impossible to travel, the permission of the Swiss Consulate must be obtained.</p>
<p>Canadians Hurry to Register</p>
<p>According to the agreement reached between the governments concerned, Canadians are included in this evacuation. Therefore, the Swiss Consulate in Shanghai published a notice in the newspaper yesterday, stipulating that all Canadian overseas Chinese or those who consider themselves qualified as Canadian citizens must go to the consulate at Room 74, French Post Office Building, 9 Avenue Edward VII before this Saturday to register, and must bring their passports for verification. In addition, those who are not born in this country, regardless of whether they have a Canadian passport or not, must present all the documentary evidence acknowledging the qualifications of official Canadian citizens.</p>
<p>Travel Expenses from the Philippines Back to the United States Are Self-Funded</p>

This cost must be borne by the evacuees themselves, estimated at US$525 per adult, US$131.25 per child under four years of age, and US$262.50 per child between the ages of five and nine. All evacuees must notify the Swiss Consulate of the names of their employers and relatives in the United States, so that the Swiss Consulate can telegraph the US government, so that the US government can collect travel expenses from their relatives, etc., for allocation. American overseas Chinese do not need to rush to notify the Swiss Consulate of the above points unless they have received official notification.</p>

<h3 id="e44">Public Anxiety Leads to Increased Selling - Government Bond Market Under Pressure - Fortunately, Buying on Dips Provides Some Stability <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the unified government bond market experienced a slight softening due to public anxiety and uncertainty. Increased selling pressure prevented the market from rebounding. However, despite the selling intentions of the bears, the large players' buying on dips created some hesitation. As a result, the market was relatively quiet, with fluctuations of only about half a yuan. The morning opened with retail investors pushing up Type C bonds to 9.20 yuan, but as selling pressure increased, prices were pushed down. Later, buying on dips by long players and short covering by retail investors led to a rebound. The market's movements were primarily driven by public uncertainty. However, based on the demand from large players, the buying side appeared to have a slight advantage. The total trading volume for the entire market was approximately 1.2 to 1.3 million yuan. A summary table is provided below:</p>
<h3 id="e45">Low Prices Spark - Interest in Chinese Stocks - Potential for Continued Rebound <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks initially remained weak, but suddenly rebounded near noon. This was due to the significant decline in prices over the past month, which sparked interest from investors. Short covering led by China Underwear and New Asia Pharmaceutical resulted in many stocks reversing their losses and rising. Given the exhausted sentiment and shift towards bullishness, there is potential for continued gains. China Underwear initially fell to 31.25 yuan, but rebounded to a high of 32.50 yuan, a gain of 0.25 yuan. Wing On also saw a low of 89 yuan, but later recovered to above 90 yuan, a gain of 1.50 yuan. Sincere remained stable after an initial decline. China National Goods remained firmly above 100 yuan. New Amusement New Asia saw a low trading price of 40.05 yuan, but a sudden surge in buying lifted the price by 2 yuan to 42.50 yuan. China France also rose by 1 yuan. Civil Friendship saw light trading and fell by 2 yuan to 60 yuan, a significant drop of 20 yuan over five days. Great China Match surged from 171 yuan to 177.50 yuan, a gain of 6 yuan. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco saw 64 yuan and rose 1.50 yuan. Public utility Shanghai Northern Water and Electricity fell to a low of 26.50 yuan, a drop of nearly 50% from its peak. While it later rebounded, it was still down 0.50 yuan. Shanghai Chinese Electric saw light trading and stable prices. Cultural industries China saw a low of 157.50 yuan, later rebounding to 160 yuan, 5 yuan lower than World. Commercial Press was flat, with limited supply and demand. Trading volume was quite significant in the first half of the day. A detailed stock market table is provided below:</p>

<p>According to reliable sources, soccer king Li Huitang has long since gone to the mainland. The rumor of him going on an expedition to Australia is also untrue.

Currently, apart from Li, 17 players including Li Tiansheng, Li Yichen, and Feng Jingxiang have decided to come to Shanghai and are expected to arrive here at the end of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e55">How I Directed "Ruo Lan's Complaint" <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Feng An</p>
<p>The story of Ruo Lan's Complaint is entirely based on Su Hui's palindromic brocade poem. Four years ago, I broadcasted it on the radio and also compiled the palindromic poem into a book on marital philosophy. Perhaps my fellow Cantonese compatriots have not forgotten it.</p>
<p>My motivation for writing this play stems from Su Hui's character and learning, which are truly moving. The so-called "approaching the end with uprightness, even in the face of frost and trembling leaves," those who lack this kind of character and thought will inevitably fail in society. In the play Ruo Lan's Complaint, the first act exposes Su Hui's shortcomings: in a nutshell, "impatience and jealousy." Originally, this kind of flaw is a common ailment among women throughout history and across cultures, and it is not unique to Su Hui. Especially in feudal China, it was simply commonplace. However, Su Hui unfortunately represents the typical woman! Therefore, in the first act, when discovering the location where Dou Tao was hiding his mistress, the atmosphere was emphasized.</p>
<p>As for the introduction of Zhao Yangtai's identity, it also creates a relief-like impression in the poetic and artistic atmosphere of the first act, reflecting Su Ruolan's character and status.</p>
<p>Dou Tao was indeed a romantic scholar, although his achievements are not as grand as Sun Kejian's, but just looking at the four sentences in Wu Zetian's biography of Su Hui, "elegant in spirit, well-versed in the classics and history, especially skilled in literature and martial arts, highly regarded for his discussions," one can know what kind of person he was. With such an outstanding and capable figure, he naturally deserves the title of a romantic scholar. Therefore, in the first act, I also briefly sketched the outline of the above four sentences. However, greed for wealth and a desire for quick success were also his lifelong shortcomings. The smile after receiving the imperial decree of "the General of Pacifying the South," however, subtly conveys Dou Tao's thoughts.</p>
<p>After the story unfolds, the greatest climax is naturally the "palindromic brocade poem," the thematic material. However, the original poem is profound and mysterious, and its syntax and meaning are scattered and misplaced. It is a purely literary work, and it must be popularized without losing the true meaning of the material. The handling of the dream scene in the third act and the introduction of the rotating sphere diagram are written according to the above method. With the climax of the second act, the fourth act is even more difficult to write, because the tragic atmosphere of the story in the historical theme material of the fourth act is almost impossible to find.</p>
<p>As for the directing, there were also many difficulties, but fortunately the results were finally overcome. Because this time I hope to realize my ideal of "improving Cantonese opera and dialect drama" for more than ten years, this time the integration of song and dance drama, Cantonese opera, and Qinghua in one furnace is indeed a bold attempt.</p>
<p>Finally, I must explain to everyone that the main purpose of this play is to guide the great way of marital life, hoping to achieve the effect of "joy without licentiousness, sorrow without injury." As for whether it is successful or not, I dare not boast here, and sincerely ask everyone for criticism and guidance, which would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Xiao Feng and Zhong Ma - Wedding Rescheduled <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— Shadow</p>
<p>The engagement of stage artists Xiao Feng and Zhong Ma has been for a long time. The former is a high-achieving student in the English Department of Guanghua University; the latter is a Bachelor of Laws from Soochow University. Both are very enthusiastic about theatrical arts. The two have similar interests, and the groom and bride are both talented and beautiful. They are truly a match made in heaven. The wedding ceremony was originally scheduled to be held on the Double Tenth Festival in the middle of this month, but because both the International and Jinmen halls were already booked, they would rather choose an auspicious day, but will still borrow the site to get married.</p>
<h3 id="e57">A Record of the Charity Rehearsal of the China National Opera School <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— Xing Yan</p>
<p>The China Opera School has only been established for eight months. The other day I went to the Golden Theater to watch the first day of rehearsals. There were a total of six excerpts: Great Blessing, Caoqiao Pass, Hanging Turtle, Zhaoguan, Money Tree (i.e., Zhang Si Jie Descending to Earth), and Fourth Son Visiting His Mother. The weather was hot that evening, but the audience was twelve times full. The upstairs and downstairs benches were all full. The scene can be described as unprecedented. Children performing is very different from adults. Adults only focus on the protagonist in each play, while small opera troupes have wonderful performances by everyone. Even a supernumerary or an impersonator (i.e., those who play pigs, sheep, etc.) is spirited and dare not slack off. Just the four words "neat and solemn" are enough to satisfy the audience, and the children's liveliness and innocence and the greatness of the scene are unified, which is especially inspiring. For example, in the play Great Blessing, if it were performed by adults, it would not have much meaning, but the China Opera School added more than 20 cloud children who ran with the clouds and seized the championship, which made it very lively. The large mask in Caoqiao Pass, the old woman in Hanging Turtle, and the old man in Zhaoguan are all extremely talented, and the tunes are all above the main palace. The voice is broad and bright, which is especially rare and very promising in the future. The martial woman in Money Tree is extremely skilled with the knives, and the appearance is also beautiful. Although there was a slip in one place during the fight, it was in an unimportant place. However, the extremely dangerous and difficult moves such as throwing the whip, changing the double guns, and kicking the flower gun with the reversed feet were extremely stable. The audience applauded thunderously. It is truly admirable that a 13- or 14-year-old girl has such skill. The finale, Visiting Mother, has a uniform distribution, and the costumes are brand new, which is very spectacular. Before the public performance, the school can be charitable and undertake this righteous act in such a hot summer, which is enough to prove the enthusiasm of the school's teachers and students for social causes.</p>
<p>(Editor's Note) On the third night of the charity rehearsal of the China National Opera School, I was invited by a friend to visit and saw that Mulian Saving His Mother and Catching and Releasing Cao had already been performed. Then the plays Fan Jiangguan, Second Entry to the Palace, and Yang Paifeng were performed. The scenes were magnificent, and the sound and appearance were beautiful. The students are at their childhood, the older ones are thirteen or fourteen years old, and the younger ones are eight or nine years old, but the performance is meticulous and logical. Whether singing, acting, speaking, or doing, all are quite skilled. The audience praised and applauded. With eight months of training, they have achieved such results, which shows the hard work of teaching and is truly commendable.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Advice to Those Planning to Stage "Begonia" <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Mingyang</p>
<p>When "Begonia" was being serialized in this newspaper, I had already read it once. After the separate edition was published, I read it carefully twice more. Judging the novel as a novel, it is indeed a rare work in recent years. Although there are also warlords, actors, and concubines in the middle, the structure is very special, and the consciousness and technique are much better than novels written on the same subject. Especially the ending after the revision, there is endless wonderfulness to savor.</p>
<p>Now I hear that China United Film Company has decided to put it on the screen, directed and written by Ma Xuwibang. At the same time, the news of staging a stage play is also very loud. It is said that a certain director is indeed interested in trying it, but only because the two male protagonists in the book—Begonia and Zhao Yukun—are not easy to find suitable actors for, and fearing failure, so it has not been decided yet.</p>
<p>This is really the biggest difficulty in staging the book "Begonia". On the screen, perhaps a clever method can be found to solve it, but on the stage it becomes a big problem. Because Begonia is the protagonist of the whole book, if he performs well, the whole play will be full of life, if he performs poorly, the whole play may fail due to personal failure. In the Shanghai theater scene, there are far fewer excellent male actors than female actors, especially like Begonia's personality (persevering and resolute), it is even more difficult to do well. For example, Shi Hui and Huang Zongjiang, both have very refined acting skills. Letting them play Begonia, they will definitely be successful after the disfigurement, but in order to increase the atmosphere of tragedy, the undisfigured Begonia must appear as a beautiful young man, and with the attitude of a famous Dan actor, which is not very suitable for Huang and Shi. Moreover, a role like Zhao Yukun who is so bloody, righteous, and yet very humorous and lively is also not easy to find a suitable person for.</p>
<p>As for the adaptation of the script, it is really not an easy task. This kind of long masterpiece that focuses on psychological description is very easy to make the screenwriter fail. The famous work of Russia, "Les Misérables," performed on the screen is far less wonderful than the original book, which is a real example. Therefore, before starting the adaptation, the screenwriter must at least carefully consider it and solicit more opinions from readers, so as not to waste a lot of effort.</p>
<p>I am very willing to see this play, and I firmly believe that if the script is well written and the actors are properly assigned, this play is bound to succeed.</p>
<h3 id="e59">The Future of Xue Youqin: Remarry or Remain Chaste? <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— Xiepu Guest</p>
<p>I remember when Xue Youqin performed at the Great Toad Stage, I went to see her perform Lady Mi in "Changban Slope" and Consort Yu in "Farewell My Concubine", as well as Lian Jinfeng, etc. Xue Niang's performance was meticulous and delicate, and she won the praise of many music lovers. After Qiu Bin Gao Lansheng left last autumn, she stopped performing on the red carpet and followed her husband to rent a house in Betty Alo Road, Betty Fang, with more joy than painting eyebrows. According to Xue Niang, she was Gao Jun's third little star and was very much loved by Gao. However, flowers do not always bloom well, and the moon waxes and wanes easily. Gao suddenly suffered from damp and cold typhoid fever and fell ill in the Sino-Western Nursing Home on Pushi Road on the eighth of last month. Although he was treated by famous Chinese and Western doctors, he was still unable to recover from his illness and finally passed away. Because Mr. Gao was usually chivalrous and generous, and cared for orphans and the poor, all his students and old friends were crying. When the gentleman passed away, Mrs. Gao was overwhelmed with grief, and Xue Niang sobbed even more, unable to speak, tears sparkling, like pear blossoms in the rain. From then on, the separated birds and separated swans felt endless sadness! After Mr. Gao's death, I don't know what her future will be like? Whether she will remain chaste or remarry is what music lovers are eager to know. According to my speculation from the facts, I believe that Xue Niang will definitely not play the old tune again during the mourning period.</p>

<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(8) What to Do?</p>
<p>Because of Cui Zhen's disappearance, and because the robbers did not care about the property, Wei Cheng thought of Fei Changhe. He stood in the courtyard, his hands tied behind his back, took two steps forward, then took a step back, and suddenly slapped his palm on his thigh and said: "It must be him, it must be him!" Magpie, seeing little strange, hurried to report to Second Madam Ye, saying: "The young master is talking to himself." Second Madam Ye walked to the courtyard and saw that Wei Cheng had already walked out of the gate, so she called out: "Wei Cheng, where are you going?" Wei Cheng stopped and whispered a few words in Second Madam Ye's ear. Second Madam Ye said: "It shouldn't be, Fei Changhe, we have not treated him wrongly, he would not do this. Cui Zhen has not treated him wrongly either, he would not do this to Cui Zhen." Wei Cheng said: "I want to go to Fei Changhe's house unexpectedly to take a look. If he is the one who kidnapped Cui Zhen, I will grab his chest regardless of right or wrong, nearby, in the countryside, far away, in the city, anywhere is fine." Second Madam Ye quickly stopped Wei Cheng and called Ah Xing to close the bamboo fence gate from a distance, and then said to Wei Cheng: "My courage has been frightened smaller and smaller by you several times. Fei Changhe's house is a door of right and wrong. This kind of person is born a rogue, a gambler, how can you go to his house? Now, wherever you want to go, you can let Ah Xing go, He Zixing go. Just don't you go."</p>
<p>Wei Cheng was stopped back into the house by Second Madam Ye, and he kept saying that Wei Cheng must not run around outside. Wei Cheng said: "The more I think about it, the more it is him. Besides Fei Changhe, there won't be a second one. He sees me and still calls me Young Master Ye, saying that the Ye family of Shide Hall is the only one who can do such a vicious and rogue thing." As Wei Cheng spoke, he touched the table with his hand, clenched his fist, and hammered it up and down on the table. Second Madam Ye said: "Don't be so angry. I will send Ah Xing out to take a look. Ah Xing goes west, He Zixing goes east. If it is really Fei Changhe who did it, you can't see it on Fei Changhe's face, you can always see it on Fei Changhe's wife and daughter's faces. This is a robbery case. It's not child's play." Wei Cheng raised his face and said: "Aunt, then let them go. I want them to come back within an hour." (164)</p>
<h3 id="e61">Artists at Shangjian: Han Fei Exercises Greatly with Dumbbells <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Ren</p>
<p>It seems that fate has destined those surnamed Han to be thin. Han Fei's thinness is almost the same as Han Langen's. Audiences who have seen him play "Robinson Crusoe" at the Carlton will never forget his bare-footed, naked, skinny and funny state, right? The reason why he can make people remember him particularly deeply is, of course, thanks to his natural and humorous style, and especially his thinness has given us a very deep impression.</p>
<p>Logically, "thin" is beneficial and harmless to Han Fei, but he himself thinks otherwise. The day before yesterday morning, I went to the Shanghai Fitness Academy and accidentally met him also exercising greatly with dumbbells in the gym, his muscles all over his body were extremely tense, which is clear evidence that he is not willing to be thin for a long time. I also saw the great director Zuo Lin, famous actor Hu Xin'an, and Shi Hui, Yingzi, Shen Min, Mo Chou, etc.</p>
<p>More than a dozen people were there. It was a pleasure to meet them in the gym. I had a brief conversation with them. From Shi Hui's mouth, I learned that their hard work is: exercising their bodies, learning to dance, immersing themselves in literature, and devoting themselves to art.</p>
<p>After they finished their morning exercises, they rehearsed the new play "The Great Trap" at the academy, preparing to perform it in the autumn, but there is no ground yet, but that will certainly not be a problem, let us wait and see. When we meet them on the stage again, not only others, but also Mr. Thin Han Fei may become a strongman, because under the guidance of Zhao Zhuguang, the president of the academy, who is rich in experience and knowledge, there is indeed unlimited hope and confidence in the transformation of their physiques.</p>
