<p>限止電力以後，曾有人倡議燃燭夜舞，這或許是「魂斷藍橋」中的燭光舞太美麗太動人了，在霓虹燈下生活的上海人是需要新的刺激的，在燭光搖曳中有女在懷，當然是別有一番滋味在心頭的。然而當前的問題不是光與影，而是限止十時一律打烊，雖有幾家舞塲關起門來通宵達旦，不過「走私」總有「失風」之日，於是再來一個要求；延長營業時間是否能爲當局採納，我們不必代為關心。即使幸而「卹念商艱」，由十時而十二時，或竟是到午夜二時，可是在興盡而返的時候，再要在西北風中安步歸府，也是美中不足，總之，當前的問題是太多了，有的爲了釜中無米粒，有的爲了如何消磨光陰，就是聰明的「設計家」，也要感到「計將安出」了？</p>

<p>但晃眼又過了六七天，這二個疑團還是不曾打破，梅寳自己旣沒有說明，韓老頭兒的話也非常模糊，這就使他覺得不能再忍耐了；而且他自己很淸楚地知道精神已一天不似一天，假使不快一些問個明白，也許他要沒有機會知道了！</p>
<p>這天下午，他便故意把梅寳打發到遠在西區靜安寺附近的一家書舖裏去，詢問上個月委托他們代替賣出的一冊「臉譜」，有了主顧沒有。待梅寳走後，他就立刻要求韓家姑娘去請他爸爸來。</p>
<p>他讓韓老頭兒坐在自己的床沿上，仲出一只瘦得像鷄爪似的右手，握住了韓老頭兒的手，毫不隱諱地吿訴了他自己心裏所懷着的兩個疑點，並且請求他解釋。</p>
<p>韓老頭兒先打了一個哈哈；馬上笑容滿面的向他作了一個揖。</p>
<p>「提起這件事，我先得向三哥道一個喜！」他這麼一說，秋海棠弄得更莫明其妙了。但韓家姑娘却已站在門邊，隨着他父親格格地大笑起來。</p>

<p>Washington, 26th (Havas) – Secretary of War Stimson has announced that a batch of U.S. troops, led by Major General Hartle, have arrived in Northern Ireland. However, the U.S. military's number, internal organization, landing port, and date of departure from the U.S. and arrival in the UK have not been disclosed. This is the first batch of U.S. troops to arrive in the UK since the outbreak of the current European war.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Allied News Agency) – According to reports from Washington, Secretary of War Stimson announced today that U.S. troops, under the command of Major General Hartle, have landed in Northern Ireland. Other details have not been announced.</p>
<p>Washington, 26th (Havas) – Regarding the dispatch of the U.S. Expeditionary Force overseas, the U.S. Foreign Policy Association issued an opinion today, stating that the U.S. Expeditionary Force, stationed 4,000 miles away, requires at least 7 million tons of shipping to transport various necessities across the Atlantic. Therefore, when dispatching the Expeditionary Force overseas in the future, it is necessary to consider President Roosevelt's announced shipbuilding plan, and the transport of U.S. troops abroad must be done by U.S. ships, with no British ships available for dispatch, which is significantly different from the last World War.</p>
<p>London, 27th (Reuters) – U.S. troops have now arrived in the British Isles. The first batch of several thousand infantrymen landed at a port in Northern Ireland a few days ago. This infantry division belongs to the combat force and is equipped with field artillery. Commander Major General Hartle was the first to land. The Governor of Northern Ireland, the Duke of Abercorn, Air Minister Sir Archibald Sinclair, and the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, Andrews, all welcomed him at the port. Sir Archibald Sinclair, on behalf of the British government, gave a welcome speech, stating that the safe arrival of U.S. troops marks a new stage in world war history. These U.S. troops are all young men in their early twenties. Apart from officers, few have experienced the last World War. When they departed from the east coast of the United States, they did not know where they were going. It was not until they glimpsed the coast of Ireland that they realized they were coming to Britain to assist in the war.</p>
<p>Sinclair's Address</p>
<p>London, 26th (Reuters) – Several thousand U.S. infantrymen landed in Northern Ireland this morning. British Air Minister Sinclair, on behalf of the British government, addressed the U.S. Expeditionary Force, saying, "You may join us here to resist the invasion of this island. From here, you will join us in attacking the continent and liberating the oppressed peoples of Europe. The safe arrival of U.S. troops in Britain will mark the beginning of a new stage in the world war and will also be a sign of Hitler's collapse." Sinclair said that the physique and equipment of the U.S. troops are equally perfect. The age of the U.S. troops seems to be young men in their twenties. Apart from officers, there are clearly soldiers who participated in the last war. They did not know that their destination was Northern Ireland until they saw the coast of Ireland. This batch of U.S. troops was sent from the eastern, western, central, and southern parts of the United States and has received excellent training. When the U.S. transport ships docked at the Irish port, the Northern Ireland band played the British and American national anthems. Major General Hartle told people, "I am very happy to be here." One officer said, "We are all ready for battle."</p>

<p>Large Numbers of Elite Indian Troops Arrive in Rangoon</p>
<p>Rangoon, 26th (Havas) – General Wavell, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific, recently arrived here to discuss Burmese defenses with the Governor of Burma, Sir Smith, and the generals of the army, navy, and air force.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 27th (Haitong News Agency) – According to reports from Baghdad, well-trained Indian troops have now withdrawn from Iraq, replaced by approximately 20,000 less experienced Indian troops stationed in Iraq. In the past two weeks, Indian troops have been seen transferring through Basra. It is rumored that after the elite Indian troops withdrew from Iraq, most of them went to Rangoon. People in Iraq estimate that 80,000 elite Indian troops have withdrawn from Iraq to date. Another 20,000 Australian troops passed through Baghdad, presumably also heading to Basra.</p>
<p>Burma Front, 26th (Allied News Agency) – The Japanese Army Air Force attacked Rangoon this morning, engaging in aerial combat with enemy aircraft. Ten enemy aircraft were shot down, and one Japanese aircraft went missing.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 27th (Reuters) – Army authorities announced yesterday that there have been no changes in the front-line fighting in Lower Burma. Although British troops have been forced to retreat southeast of Moulmein, this move is due to general strategic considerations.</p>
<p>Allied Troops Arrive in the Dutch East Indies</p>
<p>Batavia, 27th (Reuters) – Batavia Radio announced today that Allied troops have recently arrived at a port in the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<p>Saigon, 27th (Allied News Agency) – According to news from Batavia today, Japanese aircraft are conducting extensive bombing of the Dutch East Indies, especially the Ambon naval base in the Moluccas Islands.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 27th (Haitong News Agency) – After the Japanese troops occupied Kluang and Hitaam in Malaya yesterday morning, the fierce battle at the British positions there ended. While the Japanese troops were fighting in the aforementioned two locations, they divided their forces and advanced along the west coast of Malaya towards Batu Pahat, occupying the city and continuing to advance towards Seri Gading, in order to reach the highway between Johor Bahru and Singapore, cutting off the British retreat to the south and threatening the British rearguard, forcing the British troops to abandon their positions and retreat rapidly to the south. The length of the battle line there is approximately 50 kilometers.</p>
<p>Speeches by Key Dutch East Indies Officials</p>
<p>Saigon, 26th (Haitong News Agency) – Batavia news, Blas, a member of the Advisory Council of the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, gave a speech on the radio yesterday regarding the war situation. He said that although the situation in the Dutch East Indies archipelago is serious, there are various factors that encourage us, namely that the Dutch East Indies is under the unified command of General Wavell, the Dutch East Indies has a capable Governor-General, and there are brave soldiers of the army, navy, and air force. In addition, the determination of the people ensures that the Dutch East Indies will not fail.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Haitong News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced today that as of January 22, Japanese submarines had sunk 13 enemy ships, totaling 88,000 tons, including one oil tanker (8,000 tons) and one armed ship (15,000 tons) in Java and Sumatra.</p>
<h3 id="e3">British Prime Minister Churchill Refuses to Reorganize Cabinet, Reports on War Trends in the House of Commons, Asks All Members to Cast a Vote of Confidence <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>London, 27th (Reuters) – Prime Minister Churchill, in his address this afternoon at the start of the three-day debate in the House of Commons, admitted that the Japanese air raid on Pearl Harbor had temporarily damaged the U.S. Pacific Fleet, and the U.S.-British naval superiority in the Pacific and Malay Peninsula had temporarily been seized by Japan. He believed that many unfavorable news from the Far East will continue to come, because the situation has turned for the worse and will become increasingly worse. Therefore, he asked the members to cast a vote of confidence. Churchill refused to reorganize the cabinet, stating that if there were any mistakes, he would take responsibility and not blame the soldiers. The question to be decided by the vote is whether the government was right to prioritize supplying the Soviet Union, Libya, and the Near East when the Far East was still calm. It should be known that if we had dispersed the equipment throughout the Far East, we would have been ruined. The Prime Minister also refused the demand to dismiss Duff Cooper (government representative in the Far East), saying that it was a fallacy to think that Britain and the U.S. had been indifferent and indecisive about the Far East since December 7. It should be known that Britain and the U.S. have done a lot, such as reinforcing Australia and New Zealand. U.S. military aircraft will participate in defending the British Isles and attacking Germany, and large U.S. troops will continue to come and be stationed in the British Isles. When he met with President Roosevelt, Roosevelt took his hand and said, "We are determined to fight to the end, no matter the cost." The Prime Minister then discussed war production, saying that Britain's tank production had doubled in six months. The Prime Minister relayed the North African battles, saying that approximately 18,000 British troops had been killed, wounded, and captured in Libya, mostly British. In the fierce battles in Libya, British troops never had 45,000 men, confronting Axis forces more than twice as strong. The Prime Minister then announced the Allied nations' consultations, saying that it had not yet been decided whether the Pacific Council would meet in London or Washington. Australia and New Zealand both favored meeting in Washington. He had telegraphed President Roosevelt to discuss this matter. As for Australia and New Zealand's demand to hear the British policy, the British government has agreed. British, Australian, and Indian troops in the Malay and Singapore campaigns have obtained a large force of reinforcements, determined to fight to the last inch of land and not to regard the Pacific War as a secondary war. Regarding aid to the Soviet Union, the British promise to Stalin was slightly delayed due to bad weather, but it will arrive as scheduled by early February. Churchill also mentioned in his speech that German Deputy Führer Hess landed in Scotland last May, saying that Hess's mission was to make contact with "certain people" in order to expel the "Churchill faction" so that Hitler could grant Britain a lenient peace. When the Prime Minister entered the House to deliver a highly anticipated speech on his visit to President Roosevelt and the war situation, the House was packed, and everyone stood up and cheered. The Prime Minister's speech lasted 95 minutes. The South African, Australian, and Canadian commissioners to Britain, the Greek Crown Prince, and the Belgian Prime Minister were all in attendance. Among the diplomats were the ambassadors of the United States, China, Belgium, Spain, Brazil, and the Soviet Union. Judging from the signs at the end of the speech, the Prime Minister will certainly receive a vote of confidence.</p>

<p>Cairo, 27th (Reuters) – The German Commander-in-Chief Rommel's troops have received a large number of tank and aircraft reinforcements and are launching a fierce offensive to the north and northeast, hoping to cut off western Cyrenaica in one fell swoop and force the British to withdraw from the mountainous area between Benghazi and   the two ports. Benghazi is now in danger, and British troops in the port may withdraw at any time. The scope of the war is very broad, and the weather and visibility are very poor. It is difficult to determine the true situation of the battle, but it is undeniable that the situation is serious.</p>

<p>Rio de Janeiro, 26th (Havas) – The Pan-American Conference has passed many important resolutions, but most of them were voted on after major revisions to the original proposals. Among the most important are: Although the Political Subcommittee had drafted a "Rio Charter" based on the eight principles previously announced by President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill, the Conference did not directly participate in the "Atlantic Charter." The resolution passed by the Conference only stated, "The Conference hereby declares that it has taken note of the content of the Atlantic Charter. The principles commonly followed by the countries of the Americas are all included in this document and are fully in line with the Declaration of Rights and Duties passed by the Seventh Pan-American Conference in 1933. Therefore, the Conference expresses its satisfaction to the U.S. President." Regarding the rights of non-belligerent countries, the resolution passed by the Conference stated, "Any American country that is at war with a non-American country shall be recognized by other American countries as a non-belligerent country. The Conference also advises the governments of American countries to separately decide to provide special convenience to all countries fighting to defend the Western Hemisphere." A proposal submitted by the Mexican representative, advocating that the countries of the Americas should express sympathy for the occupied European countries and their governments in London, was also amended and passed by the Conference, stating, "The Conference decides to continue to maintain diplomatic relations with the governments of countries that are partially or completely occupied and hopes that all countries will quickly restore complete independence and sovereignty." The Conference passed a resolution "prohibiting any country in the Americas from representing the non-American countries that are at war with the American countries within the territory of other American countries and taking care of their interests." The Conference decided that the army and navy experts of the American countries should convene a meeting in Washington as soon as possible to discuss the ways in which the American countries can implement joint defense. The Conference requested the countries of the Americas to immediately take measures to cut off radio communication with the Axis countries and the countries they occupy. Subsequently, only the official telegrams of the governments of the American countries were allowed to be sent and received by radio. The Conference requested the representatives of the countries to strictly control submarine cables and telephone communication to prevent the transmission of telegrams that endanger the safety and interests of the American countries.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Suppressing Rent Gratuities, etc., the Shanghai Municipal Council Announces New By-laws, Including Three Items and Two Revised Articles <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>In order to suppress rent gratuities, substandard food, traffic violations, and the storage of dangerous goods, the Shanghai Municipal Council has drafted three new by-laws, Sections 54, 55, and 56, and two revised articles, Sections 35 and 36, to the Land Regulations, and submitted them to the Consular Body for approval. It is now known that the above new by-laws and revised articles have been approved by the Consular Body and officially promulgated by the Council, and a system of automatic fines for traffic violations has been established and put into effect. For the full text of the proclamation, please read the advertisement in this newspaper.</p>
<h3 id="e19">The Authorities Actively Evacuate the Population, Providing Various Conveniences, Third and Fourth Class Train and Ship Tickets are Discounted <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>According to information released by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office, the Council will set up more offices within days to issue passes to Chinese residents wishing to leave Shanghai and issue travel vouchers to obtain cheap ship and train tickets.</p>
<p>Half-Price Discount</p>
<p>The Japanese authorities have agreed that from now until February 15, second-class train tickets for individuals, fourth-class train tickets for groups of 200 or more, and third- or fourth-class ship tickets for returning to their hometowns will be discounted by half-price. The half-price vouchers issued can be used within ten days from the date of issue. Anyone who has obtained a pass can apply for a half-price voucher, which indicates the names of the people preparing to leave Shanghai and their families, so that they can use it to purchase tickets at the train station or shipping company.</p>
<p>Why Not?</p>
<p>The method of issuing half-price vouchers is of great help to those who are willing to return to their hometowns. In the future, the number of employees in Shanghai will inevitably be greatly reduced. It is more economical for workers to live in their hometowns during this emergency period. Rents are lower and it is easier to buy rice. There is no need to queue, and the amount purchased each time is also larger.</p>
<p>Fill Out an Application</p>
<p>The new application forms for passes and half-price vouchers are currently being printed. In the future, when workers fill them out, they must indicate their skills and the contact address in their hometown. When job opportunities reappear, they will be notified to return to Shanghai for work. The date of establishment of the new office will be announced separately.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Issuance of Permits: Tens of Thousands Daily <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury* reports that the International Settlement's Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) is continuing to issue permits through its Shanghai Volunteer Corps (SVC) office to facilitate residents' departure from Shanghai to return to their hometowns. This morning (the 27th), thousands of citizens gathered in the SMC's courtyard and drill hall, awaiting these permits, causing severe congestion. Although the SVC office is issuing permits as quickly as possible, it is still overwhelmed. There is a real need to establish at least one additional visa office in the Western District, which would both reduce the workload of the SVC office and provide convenience for</p>
<p>Western District Residents</p>
<p>to obtain permits. In recent days, the SVC office has issued an average of no fewer than 3,500 permits per day, but demand continues to increase. There are two other locations in the city that also issue these permits: the Japanese Consulate-General and the French Concession. The number of permits issued daily at these locations is also substantial, with an estimated total of</p>
<p>approximately 10,000 permits</p>
<p>issued each day.</p>
<p>The permit serves as a certificate proving the identity of the holder. The permits issued by the SVC office are produced by the SMC on behalf of the Japanese authorities. According to the Japanese authorities, Chinese citizens wishing to leave Shanghai do not require a special permit; they only need to hold an identification certificate to freely leave Shanghai for the interior. Regarding the already thinned-out</p>
<p>Unemployed Chinese</p>
<p>population of the city, the authorities do not yet have exact figures. It is only known that several hundred thousand Chinese have left Shanghai in the past six weeks alone. Many impoverished Chinese, although they have obtained permits, lack travel funds. For example, in the past two weeks, local cotton mills have closed, and approximately 8,000 workers have been laid off. The severance pay they received, no more than fifty yuan, is insufficient for their return journey, preventing them from leaving.</p>

<p>Since the implementation of electricity restrictions in the city, entertainment venues such as nightclubs, dance halls, theaters, restaurants, and bars have been ordered by the authorities to close by 10:00 PM. As a result, business has been exceptionally slow. Therefore, the owners of various entertainment venues have jointly requested the authorities to extend operating hours, while still complying with electricity restrictions. It is understood that the authorities, in consideration of the difficulties faced by businesses, may make accommodations, but strict energy conservation will still be required.</p>

<p>After the consensus was reached that the general closing period for all businesses in the 30th year of the Republic (1941) would be February 14th (i.e., the Lunar New Year's Eve), both the banking and currency industries, as well as various companies, factories, and firms, have begun preparations. Credit loans and current account balances issued by banks must be cleared before the general closing period. Company factories and trading firms have dispatched personnel to collect outstanding customer accounts. During this period, the customary practice of temporarily suspending all loans and credit sales is in place, and all transactions are primarily conducted with cash. The Money Trade Association will soon convene a meeting to decide on the procedures for handling business before and after the general closing period. As for the financial situation before the general closing period, it remains stable, with ample liquidity and no signs of tension. The interbank call loan rate in the Qianye market was "borrowed for nothing" yesterday, meaning that interbank lending was interest-free. Regarding the interest rate for deposits and loans for January, the Qianye Association announced yesterday that the deposit interest rate is one yuan, one yuan lower than last month, while the loan interest rate is twelve yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Proposal to Allocate Hartung's Estate to Aid Refugees <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The *Shanghai Times* reports that after the death of Luo Jialing, the woman who was the wealthiest in the Orient, an estate of 70 million yuan was left behind, attracting many claimants and resulting in litigation that remains unresolved. The other day (the 26th), a local Chinese charity proposed that one percent of this estate be used to aid and repatriate the 300,000 refugees in Shanghai. Luo Jialing's will had designated 5 million yuan for charitable purposes. Therefore, the Chinese charity's proposal is likely to add another layer of dispute over the estate. The will stipulated that the 5 million yuan allocated for charitable purposes should be distributed to various international charitable organizations in the city to provide relief to impoverished Chinese and foreigners. However, the Chinese charity is now requesting 7 million yuan from the authorities specifically for refugee relief and repatriation. This 7 million yuan should be allocated from the total estate and is unrelated to the 5 million yuan designated in the will. Meanwhile, the lawsuit over Luo Jialing's estate is still under review of all documents and requests from all parties. The rent from Hartung's properties continues to be collected by Ji Juemi.</p>

The Japanese Marine Corps' announcement also warned the public to be vigilant against the infiltration of terrorists and to report any untoward incidents to the nearest police station or Japanese military police for the apprehension of terrorists.</p>

<p>The McGregor Bank Safe Deposit Box opened for two days at the end of last year to allow renters to retrieve items. However, the items that could be retrieved were subject to the same restrictions as now. After the bank announced that it would continue to open safe deposit boxes from the 26th, more than two hundred people went to register on the morning of the same day. They were all registered at window number 12 of the bank, according to the safe deposit box numbers reported by each renter. They were all instructed to bring the registration receipt, keys, and seal to open the box at 2:00 PM on a specified date before March 10th.</p>
<p>30 Openings are Scheduled Daily</p>
<p>Only thirty households opened their safe deposit boxes the day before yesterday afternoon. The renters were still those who had registered a week ago. In addition to the renters who went to register, they can enter through the Bund gate to window number 12 to register from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM every day. Those who go to open the box and retrieve items at 2:00 PM in the afternoon all enter and exit through the side door. Only thirty households opened safe deposit boxes yesterday afternoon. The same standard will be followed to prevent congestion.</p>
<p>Conditions for Opening and Extracting Items</p>
<p>When opening the box for extraction, the items in the box are taken out and divided into two categories: items that can be taken away and items that are not allowed to be taken away. Except for the items that can be extracted, the items that are not allowed to be extracted are still stored in the box. As for the provision in its announcement clarifying the regulations for opening safe deposit boxes that prohibits the extraction of gold and silver jewelry and currency, if they are separate ornaments, such as rings and earrings, they can also be extracted. There is still no news about the opening of HSBC safe deposit boxes.</p>

<p>It is rumored that the Shanghai Gas Company intends to convert a large number of private automobiles and trucks to use gas engines. Regarding this, it is learned that, except for those necessary for important services, they are not likely to be allowed to operate. The Shanghai Municipal Council's intention is to reduce the number of automobiles still running, not to increase it. As for the application of the mechanical engineer Sukorsky to convert automobiles to use gas, the Shanghai Municipal Council must first complete the research by the specially established Alternative Fuels Committee before it can decide whether or not to allow each car to operate. It is rumored that Sukorsky's invention allows automobiles to be converted to use gas, and the speed is the same as using gasoline. Each square inch of pressure only requires 20 pounds of gas. The Shanghai Gas Company's recent plan is limited to converting eight of the company's own automobiles to use gas. One of them has already been converted, and two more will also be converted this week or next week. As for large-scale conversion, it is not the company's intention.</p>

<h3 id="e37">Western Infant Asylum's Expenses: Philanthropist Agrees to Help; Milk Powder Also Available for Free <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>There is a Western Infant Asylum at 296 Brenlin Road that specializes in sheltering orphaned and helpless foreign infants. However, since the Pacific War, the asylum's expenses have also become a problem. Recently, it ran out of funds and could not continue to pay for rent, food, and milk. Eight infants were about to be sent back to families who could not afford to feed them, and even the parents and friends of some infants could not be found, so there was nowhere to entrust them. The asylum's work was almost at an impasse. However, after issuing a plea for help, a certain anonymous philanthropist agreed to fund the asylum's expenses with 3,000 yuan per month, and the Shanghai representative of Glaxo milk powder company agreed to provide milk powder free of charge for a long time. The asylum's financial difficulties have been temporarily alleviated, and it is hoped that it can continue to operate in the future.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the unofficial gold market suddenly trended upward, and the price rose to around the 11,000 yuan mark. The confidence of all parties changed from stable to firm. This was due to the absorption and pull-up by the financial sector and the Xian Yu number, as well as the Beiqingyun Silver Shop. Transactions totaled about 2,000 taels. It opened 50 yuan lower in the early morning, at 10,600 yuan. Yu Taifeng and Yongfengyu sold down to 10,570 yuan. Chengji, Beiqingyun, and a certain gold number had strong buying interest, so it rose by 360 yuan to 10,930 yuan. Tiancheng and Yongcheng released. At 11:00, it was 10,900 yuan.

The black market price had rebounded to around 10 yuan. Silver dollars were still priced at 5.5 yuan for both buying and selling.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign currency market unanimously trended higher. The British pound and the US pound each rose by 10 yuan, the former to 260 yuan, and the latter to 265 yuan. US dollar bills also rose to 15.52 yuan. Hong Kong small bills were 2.7 yuan, and large bills were 2.6 yuan. Military currency continued to rise to 3.995 yuan.</p>

<p>In the unofficial market for government bonds, the market turned firm again yesterday. Classes C and E were the most actively traded. Tongyi ate in nearly 300,000 of Class E bonds, supplied by Hu Heji and Yiji, etc. The market price then saw a new high of 66.4 yuan in the unofficial market. On the one hand, the demand was extremely strong, but on the other hand, sellers were also very active. Temporarily, the bulls still dominated. Class C was also traded very actively, rising to 68 yuan. At 6-7 o'clock, there was some contention and fluctuation. Afterwards, Runde and Hongda surged out, and it returned to 68.35 yuan at closing. Class A was still at the original price of 72.5 yuan. Class B was 69.2 yuan, and Class D was 63.9 yuan. The buyers were Tong , Yu , Yuxing, and Changji, with Tongyi being the most active. The sellers were Hu Heji, Runde, Hongda, Renchang, Tongkang, and Yiji, with Hu Heji being the most active. The situation has gradually formed a fluctuation, but during this Lunar New Year period, if a large number of spot goods flow out, then the market price may be difficult to stabilize. The market results, except for Class A remaining unchanged and Class D rising slightly by 10 cents, the rest rose by 20 cents to 55 cents. Transactions were about 700,000 to 800,000 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e47">Double Horse Yarn Factory Orders Plummet by 100 Yuan <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Orders for Double Horse yarn are greatly weakened, and the price decline is severe. This is due to a lack of confidence, coupled with the approaching end-of-account period. Many speculative buyers, having pledged their goods as collateral, are now facing financial difficulties. Some are forced to cut their losses and close their positions, leading to a further decline in the market. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse yarn factory orders was 1,375 yuan, a drop of 25 yuan. Subsequently, sellers became even more eager to sell, while buyers were scarce, causing the price to plummet to 1,300 yuan, a decrease of 100 yuan compared to the previous day. However, the trend for 20-count Moon Lute yarn is stable, with the spot price remaining at 1,300 yuan. The factory order price is 2,100 yuan. 20-count Blue Phoenix is 2,402 yuan, and 42-count is 3,900 to 3,920 yuan. 20-count Double Horse spot goods cannot be sold at 2,000 yuan, Double Earth is 1,960 yuan, 18-count Weaver Girl is 1,990 yuan, and 20-count Celestial Maiden is 2,600 yuan. As for the previous registration matter, there has been a change. After a meeting and discussion, it was decided that re-registration will begin immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Factory Order Goods Can Be Applied for Movement; Cotton Cloth Market Prices are High <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The factory cloth market was quiet yesterday, due to the approaching end-of-account period. Local merchants are handling closing procedures, and the need for spot goods has become scarce. Furthermore, the circulation of various cloths requires obtaining permits, further stagnating market transactions. Selling prices are based on spot goods, showing considerable stability. Flower Butterfly coarse cloth is 118 yuan, Flying Goose coarse cloth is 92.5 yuan, 11-pound New Character coarse cloth is 64 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong coarse cloth is 55 yuan, Jade Dragon fine cloth is 72 yuan, Shenda fine twill is 70 yuan, and 92-yard Yong Character coarse cloth is 100 yuan, the same as the previous day. Yuxin Factory offered 500 bolts of 120-yard 84 cloth at 193 yuan, with advance warehouse receipts. Over 100 pieces of various cloths were traded on this street.</p>
<p>East Cloth: Yesterday, factory warehouse receipt goods could be applied for movement, so market prices tended to rise. The factory order price for Longtou fine cloth rose to 86.25 yuan at the afternoon close, an increase of 3.25 yuan. However, the spot price weakened to 88 yuan. Caiqiu factory orders opened at 82.75 yuan, Flying Fish at 83 yuan, Yanghe at 82.5 yuan, Trumpet at 82 yuan, and Baby fine twill at 81 yuan. Transactions for Four Gentlemen Serge warehouse receipts were also frequent, rising to 2.94 yuan. August/September orders were slightly lower, at 1-2 cents. Spot serge was 3.05 yuan.</p>

Yesterday, the Tianjin merchants' asking price for top-quality Cangzhou red dates was 180 yuan, date tops were 160 yuan, first-grade were 140 yuan, and second-grade were 120 yuan. The market's counter-offer was still 10 yuan lower, but a price increase of 20 yuan is expected, and a deal is imminent.</p>

<h3 id="e50">What Plan Can Be Devised? <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>After the electricity restrictions, some suggested candlelight dances at night. Perhaps the candlelight dance in "Waterloo Bridge" was too beautiful and moving. The people of Shanghai, who live under neon lights, need new stimuli. To have a woman in one's arms in the flickering candlelight certainly has a special flavor. However, the current problem is not light and shadow, but the uniform closing time of ten o'clock. Although some dance halls close their doors and stay open all night, "smuggling" always has the day it is "caught." So comes another request: will the authorities adopt an extension of business hours? We don't need to care for them. Even if, fortunately, they "consider the merchants' difficulties," changing the time from ten to twelve, or even to two in the morning, it is still unsatisfactory to have to walk home in the northwest wind after the fun is over. In short, there are too many problems at the moment. Some are about having no rice in the pot, and some are about how to pass the time. Even the clever "designers" must feel, "What plan can be devised?"</p>
<h3 id="e51">Stage and Screen <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— A Hui</p>
<p>Shanghai amateur film and drama performers plan to hold a Spring Festival grand performance in the near future. The plays are "The Tragic History of the Pear Garden" and "Fantasia." The performance lineup will gather the essence of Peking Opera, film, and spoken drama.</p>
<p>The "Home" at the Lafayette Theater will continue to be performed today at the request of student audiences, with special treatment, according to the Sunday matinee method, with a 50% discount on ticket purchases with a stamp. Tomorrow, the three-act satirical comedy "The Unofficial Biography of Second Master Hou" will be performed. The entire play ruthlessly criticizes and exposes this society of buying and selling short. Hou Er's insertion is not necessarily a real person, but he is a cell in society, active everywhere. If readers can relate to Zhang Bonan in "The Beginning of Man," the emergence of Hou Er will still evoke endless feelings.</p>
<p>Lianxing is currently hiring someone to write "Su Manshu," which will be directed by Ma Xubang.</p>
<p>Before "Eight Days," Jin Xing only filmed on a small scale. Now it has expanded its filming operations. In addition to Datong, the filming locations also include the Meicheng Factory, and the Yueming Studio has been leased for a long term. Yueming was originally rented to a paper factory, which began to move out one week earlier.</p>
<p>The backstage people of the Huasheng Troupe plan to rent the night show at the Oriental Theater, with a rental price of 400 yuan per day.</p>
<p>Ying Yin's posthumous work "Meat" starring Gu Chulu</p>

<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Seventeen: Return</p>
<p>But six or seven days passed in the blink of an eye, and these two doubts had not been dispelled. Mei Bao himself did not explain, and Han Laotou's words were also very vague, which made him feel that he could no longer endure it; and he knew very clearly that his spirit was deteriorating day by day, and if he did not ask clearly sooner, perhaps he would not have the chance to know!</p>
<p>That afternoon, he deliberately sent Mei Bao to a bookstore far away in the Jing'an Temple area of the West District to inquire whether there were any customers for the "Masks" that they had entrusted them to sell last month. After Mei Bao left, he immediately asked the Han family girl to invite her father over.</p>
<p>He let Han Laotou sit on the edge of his bed, stretched out a right hand as thin as a chicken claw, held Han Laotou's hand, and told him frankly the two doubts he had in his mind, and asked him to explain.</p>
<p>Han Laotou first laughed, and immediately bowed to him with a smiling face.</p>
<p>"Speaking of this matter, I must first congratulate Third Brother!" As soon as he said this, Qiu Haitang was even more confused. But the Han family girl was already standing at the door, laughing loudly with her father.</p>
<p>"This… is… what… meaning… meaning?" Qiu Haitang almost thought that the father and daughter were going crazy there.</p>
