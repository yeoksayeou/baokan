<p>營業設計</p>
<h3>營業收益與資本收益保險公司兩大生命綫</h3>
<p>— 懷萱</p>
<p>—新公司經營問題—</p>
<p>凡一事業，在創辦之初，對於營業方面，必先有縝密之預算與佈置，否則萬不可冒昧從事，尤以保險公司為更甚。按保險公司之營業收入，主要者有三種：　自留保額之保費收入，　分保保費或佣金之收入；　資本運用之利益，吾人依據上述，將保險公司之營業計劃，擬成兩種辦法，今假定有資本二百五十萬元之公司，依第一種辦法，有如下列：</p>
<p>支出方面：開辦費十萬元：經常費每月三萬元（職員入數假定為三十人）。</p>
<p>收入方面：凈費收入每月十萬元，內自留四萬或五萬元，分出六萬或五萬元，分回六萬或五萬元：</p>
<p>提置準備及開支成份：開支佔百分之三十（即三萬元）；賠款準備百分之三十（即三萬元）。準備金百分之叫十。</p>
<p>依據上項估計，即凈收入足以應付經常所需，至資本二自五十萬元除去開辦費十萬元，尙餘二百四十萬元；此項資金，即可完全運用於投資方面。按照保險業法之規定，保險業資金及責任準備金之運用，以左列各款為限：　銀錢業存款；　信託存款；　以担保確實之有價證券為抵押之放款；　以人壽保險單為抵押之放款（此指人壽公司之責任準備金而言），　以不動產為第一担保之放款，　對於公債庫劵及公司債之投資，　對於不動產之投資，故此項資金運用所得之利益，即可作為公司之盈餘</p>
<p>第二種辦法，假　公司成立伊始，營業方面尙無確切把握，則欲藉保費收入，以為開支之抱注，自屬不可能，則最低限度，必須藉資本運用所得之利息以為　充，是此一百四十萬元之資金，茍能獲得週息一分五厘或二分，方敷開支然此究非保險業之正常狀態。</p>
<p>目今保險業果在新興中，其能　第一種辦法，循正軌以求生存或發展者能有幾何？恐什九皆就第二種辦法謀資本之運用以度日歟？</p>

<h3>市塲動態</h3>
<p>公債</p>
<p>債市雖已轉蘇，脚地尙感乏力。非有新刺激，局面尙未易明朗</p>
<p>華股</p>
<p>連週萎頓市氣，稍見廓淸；，但猶未普遍化。上週最見生色者為新藥業股，除若干例外，幾無　不漲。新藥股夕昇降，對整個股市時起興奮作用。此一機運，亦可予今後股市以若干挑撥力，或未可知。惟銀聯會所頒拆放辦法，對於華股評價，以不超過票面為原則。予一般股票交易，不無起相當之約束力。</p>
<p>紗布</p>
<p>紗有環境，迄未好轉；但人心則已轉堅。上週內各檔貨價均見暴漲，八一三後為尤甚，殊堪注意。週末藍鳳已達五千三百元，雙馬廠單又駕現貨而上之，一度抵五千三百五十元高價。廠布東疋一致追上。銀聯會認可貨物做拆放，實為一服興奮劑也。</p>
<p>西藥</p>
<p>新藥業各股之挺秀，實為西藥市氣好轉之反映。上週內跌勢轉穩，反撥力目露端倪。但環境上仍無樂觀可言。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>雜糧交易，極為混沌，漲跌互見。據傳配給辦法巳經決定，配給價以軍票計，天津黃豆每　三十三元半，天津生仁四十五元半，天津青豆二十八元半，菉三十三元半，赤豆二十九元半。</p>

<p>健康</p>
<h3>營養與心理健康</h3>
<p>— 大芬</p>
<p>前些時靑年會會舉行過一次營養展覽，很引起社會人士的注意，但營養的充份與不足，非但和身體健康有關，就是和心理健康也有密切的關係·尤以維生素乙一為甚。</p>
<p>普通我們都知道維生素乙一的缺乏，易致脚氣病。但殊不知它與心理方面也息息相關。食物中稍缺維生素乙一，人的脾氣便變得暴躁，非常易怒。經常不足的結果，乃有心灰意懶，無精打彩，及自卑情緒等。</p>
<p>情緒常態的婦女，食物中各種營養素都有，唯缺維生素乙一，二三星期後便可發現心理上的症候，日子越長，也就越加顯著。如，精神不能集中，記憶糢糊，手足無措，怕羞，自卑，易怒，沮喪，不安等。愉快的，合羣的人，變得冷漢，懶惰，不願與人合作。</p>
<p>因此我們可以相信，某些所謂神經衰弱的病人，實係營養不足，缺少維生素乙一·不過若是醫生以維生素治病，常不免碰壁：病人會懷疑地問，維生素可治病嗎？然而，答案是肯定的。所以治療這些病症，須經常配以營養適當的食物。如某些弱徵根深蒂固時，治療便見困難了。</p>
<p>食物中含維生素乙一的並不多，僅穀類，瘦猪肉，豌豆，黃豆等中含有一些·如果我們食物中缺少這東西，便要患維生素乙一不足症了。但碾過的白米與製成的麵粉，維生素乙一已消失甚多了。但，最近美國有一種「營養麵粉，却會有充份的維生素乙一。</p>
<p>總之，我們現在已有理由可以確信維生素乙一與心理健康相關甚密，至於其他各種維生素，是否也與心理健康相關，則尚有待於研究。</p>
<h3>荳沙包</h3>
<p>— 埜堂</p>
<p>從廣東人的食品攤上，買了一隻荳沙包充飢。不料咬了一口，發覺麵粉內含着不少的細沙。這隻包子，旣含「荳」，又含「沙」，實在可稱名符其實的「荳沙包」了。</p>
<p>隨筆</p>
<h3>甘露</h3>
<p>— 田力</p>
<p>傍晚，從補習學校回來。天氣這麼熱，全身內衣　濕得和身體貼住。嘴，當然也非常渴；因為快兩個多鐘頭了，連一點水也沒有進口。於是，急忙忙地趕回廠去，去享受我現在最需耍的甘露——冷開水。從學校回廠去的路雖不算速，可是也有三四果左右。在這路程上，你能够想見我是多麼的焦急啊！希望一步就到廠，但事實上你愈想快，却愈覺得路途遙遠，走走遼不到。</p>
<p>在上海，其實解渴的東西芷多着：汽水啦，桔汁啦，水淇淋啦，水磚啦……，這些沿路都有出售，何必一定要冷開水呢？哦，你得知道，這些冷飲上品，並不是為我們一輩窮措大預備的啊！所以，每當我走過一家飲水室時，簡直連頭也不敢回一回。有人說：望梅可以止渴。而我却相反地以為看飲水室，只有更增加我的口渴。於是，脚步比前更加緊些，希望快一些到廠。</p>
<p>好容易路進廠門，立刻就把進校前預先凉着的冷開水盒出，一口氣咯噔咯噔喝上十口。這時，口中得到了水的滋潤，全身頓然舒服了起來，我知一道自已的臉上一定在微笑了。因為我覺得滿足，勝利，而且幸福。</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（八）　奈若何</p>
<p>葉二太太也曾料到，或許維域有什麼難言之隱，就不追問下云·倒是向阿興問了許多話，阿興對主母問的話，自然知之為知之，不知為不知，據實報吿·葉二太太道：從別的倒沒有什麼，就是這麼冷的天氣，你們往外跑，第一要防手上脚上長陳瘡。」她眞把維城看做自已云的孩子，伸手到他臉上摸了摸，說道：「可不是麼？維城，你的臉本來是光光滑滑的，現在就不對了。你屋子甚有雪花膏嗎。快些在洗臉的時候，先把胰子擦上一擦，再塗些雪花膏」。翠珍忙接應道：「城弟要，我屋子裹有。反正也是城弟給我買的」。翠珍雖然這樣執誠地吿訴維城，說到下半裁，覺得是城弟給我買的，又何必吿訴二伯母，况且二伯母之外，又有喜鵲阿與等等站在屋子裏。她有些後悔了，後悔在心裏臉上却自會熱烘洪地有一種說不出的難受。串而維城對答得快，說：「羣珍姊，我屋子裹有」。這才稱掩飾過云了。</p>
<p>是維城的衣覆，跟維城出云旅行了一回，回來時經翠珍一件件檢點過了，維城說過需要休息，她把夏天常躺的籘椅上，舖上了一條西狗皮毯子，請他躺下。葉二太太道：「卻還不如早一些睡吧。我們有話，都在明天談了·以後，維城，你不要往外亂跑，你是把兩條腿往外一跑，我倒是把一顆心也往外一跑」。維城唯唯諾諾到他寢室裏去睡了。又是到了葉二太太請維城深夜去談話的時候，維城不請自來，獨自一個，暗中摸索到葉二太太房裏來。他輕輕的在房外喚了一聲嬸娘，葉二太太你回答：維城到了房裏，又是接連喚了兩聲。葉二太太睜眼一看，知道是維城來了，他裏着一件厚絨的寢衣，說：「嬸娘，我吿訴你必定要去我國器國芳兄妹的理由，趁翠珍姊不在面前·」　（一五六）</p>
<p>話匣</p>
<h3>小姐學校</h3>
<p>— 潘淑嫻</p>
<p>學校裏的小姐們</p>
<p>從前曾有人把杭州三所女校的學生，分為三種不同的階級：省立女中的學生，短髪短裙，樸素而愛運動，是學生派；另一所私立而非敎會設立的女校，學生年齡多數較大，愛打扮而偏不整潔，又歡喜唱些壓扁了喉嚨的「桃花江」之類的歌曲，就被稱為「碧玉派」；而那所敎會女校裏的學生呢，則因為她們都穿旗袍，唱洋歌，比較沉靜，比較大方，就被稱為「小姐派」。</p>
<p>不僅杭州如此，各地的敎會女校除了少數例外，大多數都有着「小姐學校」的尊號。而道些學校裹出來的小姐們，往往也特別使許多有閒階級發生興趣。</p>
<p>在上海，有許多社交名媛是敎會學校裏的學生。她們都是漂亮大方，裝飾得雍容華貴，能跳飄飄欲仙的交際舞；能講極流利的英語；多數還能玩一點兒音樂。近來自由車大出風頭，你只要站到街上去獃看，凡車子最漂亮，衣服最考究，頭髮最　登的女士們，十個中準有九個是敎會女校中的小姐。</p>
<p>然而如果以為一切敎會女校中的學生們全像她們一樣，那可就大錯了。的確，敎會女校的學生，因為學校收費較高，所以往往是家庭知識程度較高，經濟狀况較好，而且所受的敎育比較洋化的，因此也許穿得比有些非敎會學校的女學生們整齊些，然而奢侈却談不到。即使是在海上聞名的最「小姐派」的女子中學裹，多數學生還是穿着並不太新的布衣的。而且見了生客，多數還是靦觍含羞，不大像老資格的交際花。</p>
<p>在功課方面，一般人往往以為敎會學校的學生英文必定高明，國文必定馬虎。這也不盡然。敎會學校出身的學生，除了極少數英文程度確然超卓外，普通也不過平平而巳。國文方面則因為有些敎會學校當局本身對於中文就不大有研究，往往因想洗雪「敎會學校國文程度必定不佳」的壞名譽，而致矯枉過正，愛請些前淸貢生或秀才之類的老先生來敎授國文。自然，我們不能一筆抹殺，說這些人完全沒有資格做中學的國文敎員，其中有眞才實學而又循循善誘的，也不在少數；可是往往有許多秀才，除了會背四書五經外，並不懂得『國粹」眞的是什麼，更不必談能引起學生對國文發生興趣的敎授法了。因此學生在課室內雖然須寫「人生於世」的文言作文，甚至須做七言五言的舊體詩，然而在日常生活上，却常會弄得連一封通順大方的普通白話信也寫不好。當然我們還是可以舉出許多文章寫得不錯的出自敎會學校的女士們來的，可是一般而論，敎會學校的國文程度多數總是及不上有些非敎會學校的。</p>
<p>這幸福是怎樣得來的呢？是我在去校之前，先將熱開水放在大杯子裏叫它凉的。回來時，路上也不敢躭擱，一氣走到廠，道一切都是我自己做的，道幸福也是我自己所造成的。</p>
<p>這雖然僅僅是一件極微小的瑣事，然而它便我得到一種啟發。不論你希望做一件什麼事，只要你有計劃，不怕難，不在半途被他人引誘而放棄你的目標，這樣不斷地努力榦去，那末，決不會不達到目的。達到目的的時候，幸福當然也跟着屬於你了。</p>
<h3>眞理</h3>
<p>— 藍柯</p>
<p>一天我在街頭看見「山人」背着葫蘆，扯着小旗，說是在拍賣眞理，我不禁對術士的語言感到了一點憤怒。眞理也成了草頭藥了。</p>
<p>眞理是至善的創造，所以它是一種行動，不是一種情感，更不是術士的語言。</p>
<p>要想達於至善，最便捷的路徑無過於為大多數人造福，為社會團體造福。記住，是為別人，並非僅僅為自己造福。為自已造福祇是替他人增添不幸，招致混亂而巳。</p>

<h3>President of the Indian Freedom League to Visit the Indian Governor-General Shortly, Hoping for a Peaceful Resolution to the Indian Problem; Gandhi's Secretary Desai Dies in Prison</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 15th, Allied News Agency: Reuters reports from Bombay that the President of the Indian Freedom League, Sapru, is scheduled to visit New Delhi soon to confer with Governor-General Linlithgow. Sapru hopes to resolve the Indian problem by convening representatives from all factions for a roundtable conference.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 16th, Allied News Agency: A report from Bengal states that Gandhi's secretary, Desai, who was imprisoned along with Gandhi a week ago, has died in custody due to illness. At the time, he was talking with the prison warden and two other prisoners when he complained of dizziness. He was then treated by Gandhi's doctor in the same location, who administered heart stimulants and all possible treatments, but to no avail. He passed away twenty minutes after the onset of symptoms.</p>
<p>Bangkok, 16th, Haitian News Agency: News received here last night states that British authorities in Bombay announced the death of Gandhi's secretary and assistant, Desai, in prison. However, the cause of death was not announced. The brutal actions of British military police in India have resulted in 600 deaths and 4,000 injuries among Indians.</p>
<p>Unrest Continues in Various Parts of India</p>
<p>Bombay, 15th, Havas Agency: Conflicts between police and demonstrators continue to occur in various parts of India today. The situation in each location is described below: In Dhaka, police opened fire on demonstrators to suppress them, resulting in five civilian deaths and four injuries. Subsequently, the garrison was reportedly dispatched to the scene to assist the police in maintaining order. Civilians threw stones at them, and telephone lines in various locations were cut. Demonstrations also occurred in the southern outskirts of Calcutta, with crowds throwing stones at the police, who had to open fire to disperse them. Local authorities have decided to suspend classes in all schools, from elementary to high school, for ten days. In Benares, citizens marched in formation, led by the flag of the Indian National Congress. Police intervened, and the citizens practiced passive resistance, immediately sitting on the ground. Unable to disperse the crowd, the police opened fire. In Wardha, police opened fire, resulting in one civilian death. In the Central Provinces, two serious incidents occurred yesterday: one involving demonstrators storming a station near Hoshangabad, and the other involving a fire at the Pachmarhi station. According to the British official gazette, the situation in Nagpur is gradually improving.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 16th, Haitian News Agency: According to news from London, disturbances have also occurred in the Assam region along the India-Burma border. The former governor of Assam, Bardoloi, has been arrested for attempting to endanger British security. In addition, thirty-four Indians have been detained in Dhaka. The majority of the Indian crowds were students who immediately demonstrated to protest the authorities' actions. While police attempted to disperse the crowds, another group of demonstrators broke into a British school and burned textbooks, which they considered to distort Indian history and drug Indian youth. Indian authorities have declared martial law and prohibited gatherings of five or more people in the streets. British police have killed seven Indians, injured thirty-seven, and arrested approximately fifty. Crucial machinery was also removed. Clashes between police and demonstrators also occurred in Nagpur, with machine gun fire incessant throughout the day. It is estimated that approximately twelve people were killed yesterday. The number of striking workers in Calcutta continues to increase, with fewer than half of the British factories in the city continuing to operate. British police in the city's port area and workers' residential areas frequently opened fire to disperse crowds. The situation in Bombay is similar, with many civilians killed. Disturbances have also occurred in the Madras region on the east coast of India.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 15th, Allied News Agency: According to news from New Delhi, the anti-British movement in India has intensified. Even in New Delhi, where the Indian Governor-General's residence is located, Indians are constantly attacking the city's railways, telephones, and other government agencies. It is reported that the Governor-General's residence has promulgated strict laws stipulating the death penalty for anyone who interferes with telecommunications and other public facilities, and imposing fines on residents near those who cause the damage. Furthermore, according to the Associated Press, the anti-British struggle in India spread to the central states on the 14th, where four major stations were destroyed. The disturbances in Madras are also gradually expanding. 11,000 Indian laborers in Calcutta have also resolutely refused to return to work. Furthermore, it is reported that Indian civilians are prepared to launch large-scale demonstrations in major cities throughout India on the 16th. The methods of suppression the British authorities will take in response are attracting considerable attention.</p>
<p>National Daily Forced to Cease Publication</p>
<p>Bombay, 15th, Havas Agency: According to British official announcements, Nehru's organ, "National Herald," has been ordered to temporarily cease publication by the authorities. In addition, two other organs of the National Congress, one being the "Ananda Bazaar Patrika" in Bombay and the other being the "Praja Bandhu" in Ahmedabad, will also cease publication. According to Avasni, chairman of the Press Censorship Committee of the Governor-General's Office, the British government has no intention of interfering with the people's right to make political demands or criticize politics, but it will crack down on the spreading of riotous events and will never condone them.</p>
<p>Muslim League Held Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>Lisbon, 16th, Allied News Agency: According to a report from the All India Radio yesterday, the Executive Committee of the All India Muslim League met in Bombay today to discuss the current political situation, chaired by Ali Jinnah.</p>
<p>Bose Broadcast Encouraging Indians</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th, Haitian News Agency: Indian leader Bose broadcast to the nation, saying, "The mask of Britain has now been torn off, and barbaric forces have once again taken control of India. Under the tear gas, batons, and bullets, the Indian people will ask, 'Where are the four freedoms?' This cry is transmitted across the seven great oceans of the world, and there is no echo, not even a word from Washington. India also asks, 'Where is the Atlantic Charter that allows every nation to have its own government?' London replies, 'The Atlantic Charter does not apply to Indian affairs.' This is the position of British and American imperialists on the Indian problem. India is not isolated and helpless in its struggle against British and American imperialism. All countries at war with Britain today are willing to support India. Therefore, all Indians overseas should devote all their efforts to achieving India's goals, day and night, and work tirelessly to bring about the rapid collapse of the British Empire so that India can achieve freedom as soon as possible." Bose finally urged the Indian people to fight to the end and not lose their courage because of the arrest of their leaders.</p>
<h3>Major Changes Expected in British Colonial Policy; U.S. Senator Advocates Worldwide Promotion to Clarify Principles of the Atlantic Charter</h3>
<p>Berlin, 15th, Havas Agency: Recently, the London Times published an article entitled "Colonial Cooperation," which stated in part, "There is no doubt that British colonial policy is about to undergo major changes, and in fact, it has already begun to change. The cooperation of the United States is a major factor that our country should consider when making decisions." At the same time, the newspaper also proposed the "Association of English-Speaking Nations," requesting the government to formulate an outline for joint action. German semi-official sources have paid close attention to this article, believing that the United States has made extensive demands on Britain regarding colonial issues. However, one thing to note is that while Britain, based on the Atlantic Charter, advocates granting "complete freedom" to the Philippines and the Malay States, it only advocates "joint development" by Britain and the United States for the various colonies it still controls, which is inconsistent.</p>
<p>New York, 15th, Havas Agency: New York State Senator Mead gave a speech here today, advocating the immediate launch of a large-scale publicity campaign to make the principles stipulated in the Atlantic Charter clear to the people of the world. Mead also said that after the Allied Powers achieve complete victory, they will encounter a very important problem, namely, forming an international organization based on the principles of justice, humanity, and the Atlantic Charter. It is said that Senator Mead, who is running for Governor of New York State, has received the support of President Roosevelt.</p>
<p>Berlin's Criticism</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th, Haitian News Agency: A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry said yesterday that President Roosevelt's telegram to Churchill on the anniversary of the Atlantic Charter was very weak in its wording. He must have been fantasizing when he talked about the United Nations including twenty-eight countries. Regarding the possibility of Chongqing mediating the Indian problem, the spokesman pointed out that the leader of Chongqing is only listening to the orders of the United States because Song Ziwen has been in Washington for a long time. Therefore, Chongqing's various efforts to mediate the Indian problem are entirely initiated by the United States. The spokesman then discussed the article "Colonial Partnership" published in the London Times, discussing the importance and value of the Atlantic Charter. He said that Britain is like a small business that now wants to cooperate with a wealthy shareholder. At the same time, the countries and territories given freedom by the Atlantic Charter will be subjected to U.S. economic aggression.</p>
<h3>First Meeting of the Burmese Executive Government</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 15th, Allied News Agency: Since its establishment on August 1, the Burmese Executive Government, under the leadership of Dr. Ba Maw, has been working hard on the construction of a new Burma. The Executive Government held its first meeting on the 15th. The various ministers delivered their aspirations for future governance one after another, which lasted for more than three hours before it was completed. According to Mr. Takano, the chief secretary who attended the meeting, the impression he got was that the ministers, including Dr. Ba Maw, were able to cooperate sincerely and help each other in the construction of the new Burma, and were also able to humbly accept Japan's guidance and assistance. At this meeting, the language used by Dr. Ba Maw was no longer the English used in the pre-war cabinet meetings, but pure Burmese. The ministers had detailed discussions on how to eliminate the British color remaining in Burma, and had even more meticulous discussions on how to build a new Burma in Greater East Asia in the future.</p>

<p>Berlin, 15th, Havas Agency: The German News Agency recently issued a message stating that the northwest coast of Europe, from the Barents Sea in Northern Europe to the Skagerrak Strait in Denmark, has been fortified like a rock after two years of efforts. The strategic points of each army are all built with very solid fortifications by the "Todt Organization," which cannot be destroyed by aircraft and artillery. There are also airfields, which can launch attacks against the enemy at any time. There are also machine gun positions between the bunkers and mortar positions, thus forming a continuous line of fire. Elite troops are stationed throughout the front line. These troops are well-trained for their special tasks and have recently been replenished and various obstacles have been added. Any attempt to invade the European continent from the northwest will ultimately fail.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 15th, Allied News Agency: According to a dispatch from Sydney, former Australian Minister of Commerce and Special Envoy to Britain, Page, arrived here on the 15th. Page was dispatched to Britain as a special envoy by Prime Minister Curtin last winter. While staying in Britain, he often attended British wartime cabinet meetings as a representative of the Australian government.</p>
<p>Melbourne, 15th, Havas Agency: Sir Keith Murdoch published an article in the Herald today, the gist of which is: "When the Australian army participated in the Malayan campaign before, its performance was greatly diminished because it could not integrate with the Indian and British troops. In addition, some soldiers shrank back when facing the enemy, which caused chaos in the army. Therefore, we must do our best to maintain military discipline in the future and never underestimate the enemy again."</p>
<h3>Current Situation in Thailand</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 16th, Allied News Agency: Thailand exports products such as rice, tin, and teak every year, while almost all industrial products are imported from foreign countries. After the war, the import of foreign goods was completely cut off. Whisky and foreign cigarettes, etc., are no longer available. The price of sugar has also increased fivefold compared to the past. Matchboxes, soap, sugar, and gasoline are all rationed to prevent hoarding. At the same time, efforts are being made to rebuild the economy. Prime Minister Pibulsonggram once said that everything from toothbrushes to steel should be self-sufficient. In the market of Bangkok today, many daily necessities such as soap and toothpaste are supplied by Japan. Since the beginning of the New Life Movement in Thailand, the people's lives have gradually improved. Women who do not wear hats on the street will be fined. In addition, anyone who does not wear a tie or wears shorts is prohibited from entering and exiting government offices. The Thai government believes that Thais have been indulging in pleasure for hundreds of years, and that without rectification, it will not be enough to revitalize their spirit. Today, apart from coolies and women bathing in the mud in the suburbs, those who come and go in the city all have the demeanor of gentlemen. The men and women youth corps members in uniforms are particularly energetic. The future of the new Thailand has unlimited hope.</p>

<h3>Allied German Forces Break Through to the Outer Perimeter of Stalingrad; Tank Battles Erupt on the Don River; German Forces in the Caucasus Advance Towards the Black Sea</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, a location on the Ukrainian border, 16th. German and Allied forces have broken through to the outer perimeter of Stalingrad.</p>
<p>Allied Press, Xiongcheng [likely a transcription error, should be Stalingrad], 16th. German mechanized infantry and tanks are attacking Stalingrad from the northeast of Nikolov. After fierce fighting northeast of Kotelnikovo, German forces regrouped their infantry and added fresh troops to reinforce the southern flank of the pincer movement, hoping to capture the major city of Stalingrad on the lower Volga River. General von Kleist's troops in the Caucasus are advancing towards the Black Sea.</p>
<p>Allied Press, Lisbon, 16th. According to a London news broadcast, German forces operating northwest of Stalingrad, a key industrial city in the Soviet Union, are now 40 miles from the city.</p>
<p>Allied Press, Berlin, 15th. According to a German command announcement, German forces operating in the North Caucasus have occupied Georgievsk, a crucial point on the Vistula-Baku railway, located 20 kilometers northeast of Pyatigorsk.</p>
<p>Allied Press, Xiongcheng [likely a transcription error, should be Stalingrad], 16th. General von Kleist's mechanized forces are advancing in the southern Caucasus, while German forces in the north continue to strengthen their threat to Stalingrad. German tanks and motorized infantry divisions launched attacks all night on the Kletskaya front. The southern arm of the German forces encircling Stalingrad is closing in on the city. Although not confirmed by any source, a Vichy broadcast reported that German forces in this area had advanced to within 40 miles of Stalingrad. However, Moscow sources acknowledge that the situation in that area has deteriorated. German forces near Kletskaya launched 100 tanks in four consecutive assaults on Soviet lines, attempting to reach the banks of the Don River. In the morning, Soviet rifle divisions lost several important positions, but Soviet artillery rushed to their aid, temporarily reversing the situation. The German forces then launched three more attacks, capturing some territory. The German forces are using tanks in waves of 20 to 30 vehicles, launching attacks every few minutes, supported by heavy artillery fire and dive bombers. The German objective is to clear the road for motorized infantry to advance and consolidate their gains on the Don River. Soviet forces are using artillery and anti-tank guns to resist, but the relentless German attacks forced the Soviet forces to retreat. In the Caucasus, after recently capturing Georgievsk, German forces are continuing to advance towards the Grozny oil fields. Fierce fighting is now taking place in the Mineralnye Vody region.</p>
<p>Allied Press, Moscow, 16th. According to the Soviet Information Bureau's midnight communiqué, fighting continues to be intense in the Stalingrad and Caucasus regions. On August 15th, the Red Army engaged German forces in the areas southeast of Kletskaya, northeast of Kotelnikovo, and in the Krasnodar and Maikop regions. There were no major changes in other sectors.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Stockholm, 16th. German military circles are focusing this morning on the Stalingrad, Novorossiysk, and Grozny regions. Intense fighting is taking place in these three theaters, and the outcome will have a decisive impact on the German summer offensive launched 50 days ago. According to the latest reports, large-scale tank and infantry battles have erupted in the Stalingrad region since the German forces occupied Kalach on August 12th, reaching a critical point. The fighting near Stalingrad is arguably one of the most intense battles of the German-Soviet war, a fact acknowledged by German military circles. Both sides have deployed large numbers of tanks and infantry to the area. The Red Army is putting up a desperate resistance, determined not to give up an inch of ground, so German advances have been slow in recent days. Yesterday's Red Army communiqué mentioned "south of the city of Kletskaya" for the first time, indicating that the Red Army has continued to retreat in the Don River bend. However, the German pressure has increased, forcing the Red Army to withdraw from the town of Kettelmusky-Ingaya. German forces have advanced rapidly to the new defensive line established by the Red Army at the town of Proboya, which is less than 30 miles from Stalingrad. At the same time, another German armored division is advancing along the Kotelnikovo railway, reaching a point 30 miles from Stalingrad.</p>
<p>Soviet Counter-Attacks in the Central and Northern Sectors; Ace German Pilot Killed in Action</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 16th. German aircraft have been extremely active in the past 24 hours. The ports of Anapa, Novorossiysk, and Tuapse on the Black Sea have been bombed, severely disrupting Soviet transport and supply lines. A Soviet destroyer and four coastal vessels have been sunk, and another destroyer has been damaged. German forces crossing the Kuban River have established several bridgeheads. Georgievsk has been occupied by German forces, and tanks are operating between the Kuma and Terek rivers. Fighting has also intensified in the central sector, with battles taking place in Vyazma and Volkhov. Although Soviet forces have launched large-scale attacks, they have not achieved any major victories.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 16th. Berlin military sources claim that the German defensive posture in the central and northern sectors of the Eastern Front is proceeding smoothly. In the area east of Vyazma, enemy forces, covered by artillery fire, launched fierce attacks on our lines, but were repulsed by our defending forces. Enemy attacks in the Rzhev area have also failed to achieve their objectives.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Bern, 15th. German air ace Lieutenant Ostermann was killed in action several days ago in a fierce aerial battle with Soviet aircraft over Lake Ilmen. He engaged five enemy aircraft single-handedly. He scored 102 aerial victories during his career.</p>
<h3>Reinforcements on Both Sides of the Egyptian Front; Major Battle Imminent; British Warships Gather at Gibraltar; New Convoys Being Organized</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Washington, 15th. According to reports from Cairo, both sides on the Egyptian front have received reinforcements and are preparing for a decisive battle. Military sources here agree with the British view that the British forces must hold Egypt until the end of October to have any hope of victory. In general, the Axis powers have shorter supply lines in North Africa, giving them an advantage over the British forces. For the British, however, their merchant convoys coming from the Mediterranean are under serious threat from enemy air and naval forces, and they are hesitant to divert troops from the Middle East to reinforce Egypt due to the tense situation in the Caucasus.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Madrid, 16th. According to reports from Algeciras received here this morning, a British aircraft carrier, two battleships, sixteen destroyers, and several torpedo boats entered the port of Gibraltar yesterday. There are now a total of four aircraft carriers in the port, two of which have been heavily damaged, three battleships and cruisers each, twenty-six destroyers, and several torpedo boats and submarines. It is reported that the authorities in Gibraltar are planning to organize new convoys to sail in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Madrid, 16th. The British merchant ship that fled into the port of Valencia on Friday, though heavily damaged, departed yesterday. It is reported that the ship will sail to the port of Gibraltar.</p>
<p>Allied Press, Berlin, 15th. In the major naval and air battle in the western Mediterranean that began at dawn on the 11th, the Axis forces, with absolute superiority, have achieved an overwhelming victory in the past five days. According to a German High Command announcement on the night of the 15th, the naval and air battle in the western Mediterranean has ended in a major victory for the Axis forces. A large British convoy carrying military supplies has been decisively struck. Only a few damaged transport ships have reached Malta. The remaining fleet, unable to withstand the attacks, has retreated to the port of Gibraltar. In this battle, the German and Italian air and naval forces cooperated in an organized manner, demonstrating once again the difficulty of British transport in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 16th. An eyewitness to the Axis attack on a British convoy in the Mediterranean between August 11th and 13th told Haitong News Agency that the sinking of the British aircraft carrier "Eagle" was the prelude to the latest Allied tragedy. Axis aircraft attacked the heavily defended British convoy in waves. The enemy's defenses were very strong, with aircraft from the accompanying aircraft carrier and anti-aircraft guns on every ship fully deployed. During the fourth Axis air attack, another aircraft carrier was hit and exploded, causing a large fire. Ships and oil tankers were sunk, damaged, or set ablaze. The gasoline carried by the oil tankers floated on the sea surface, covering a radius of two kilometers. The remaining ships that were still able to move had to quickly leave the burning sea. After the air attack began, German and Italian warships immediately arrived to assist in the battle. The remaining ships of the convoy were repeatedly attacked by German and Italian bombers, so only a few ships reached Malta, but were still under attack by the Axis air force.</p>
<h3>Italy Uses Wooden Torpedo Boats in the Mediterranean</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Rome, 16th. Local officials announced yesterday that the Italian Navy recently used new-style wooden torpedo boats to attack a British convoy in the western Mediterranean. These torpedo boats are wooden, agile, and very fast, and are commanded by young naval officers.</p>
<h3>International Military and Diplomatic Developments Last Week</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Vichy, 16th. There are four major international events this week: 1. the rapid development of the German offensive in the Caucasus; 2. the naval and air battle in the Solomon Islands; 3. the naval and air battle in the western Mediterranean; 4. the disturbances that have occurred throughout India following the arrest of Indian National Congress leaders. As for diplomacy, although there have been no major developments, it should not be overlooked. The details and results of the Moscow conference have been kept secret. It is difficult to say whether the three countries of Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union have decided on joint action plans during this conversation process. For example, whether the opening of the second battlefield has been decided is also difficult to guess. All that is known is that the newspapers of Great Britain and the United States have become less enthusiastic about this issue than before. While military experts from Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union were conducting negotiations in Moscow, the German army was launching an offensive in the Caucasus. Strategic points from the Garmeh desert to the lower reaches of the Volga River were under intense German attack, and the Sea of Azov and Black Sea coasts were again captured one after another. The last base of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet has also been directly threatened. The Soviet authorities are deeply concerned that their warships may be intercepted and confined by Turkey in the future. Rumors that the Soviet Union has been negotiating with the Turkish government have not been confirmed. Generally speaking, Turkey should continue to maintain a neutral position. Although Foreign Minister Memduh Şevket Esendal has been succeeded, this consistent policy is unlikely to change. In addition, the development of the German offensive in the Caucasus is enough to influence the political situation in Iran. The pro-Axis tendencies of the country's new Prime Minister, Soheili, are weaker than those of the previous Prime Minister, which is one example. In short, the war in the Caucasus will directly affect the situation in the Near East and indirectly affect the situation in India.</p>
<h3>Turkey Firmly Declares Neutrality; British Request Regarding Soviet Fleet Rejected</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Berlin, 16th. According to reliable sources in Istanbul, the Turkish government has rejected British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen's request that Turkey allow the Soviet Black Sea Fleet to escape into Turkish ports. The Turkish government replied to Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen that "our country is determined to maintain absolute neutrality. Therefore, we are not willing to sign special agreements for the warships of belligerent countries. If any warships of belligerent countries escape into our ports, we will immediately disarm them in accordance with international law and confine all the sailors."</p>
<h3>US Army Plane Crashes During Training Exercise</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Lisbon, 16th. News from Hastings City, Michigan, states that a US Army plane crashed during a night training exercise. The pilots were killed. The number and details are unknown.</p>
<h3>Iraq Controls Trade</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Istanbul, 16th. It is learned here that in view of rising prices and supply difficulties, the Iraqi government has now placed the import and export trade of important commodities in the country's markets entirely under state control. It is said that this is based on the advice of British consultants.</p>
<h3>Vichy Arrests Communists</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Vichy, 16th. Local officials declared that many Communists have been arrested recently in Montpellier and Toulouse. Twenty-six people were arrested in Montpellier. Those arrested in Toulouse are mostly Spanish and Polish radicals.</p>
<h3>Explosion on Chilean Destroyer</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Santiago, Chile, 15th. A depth charge exploded on the destroyer "Hyatt" while it was conducting exercises near the port of Tocopilla, killing two sailors on the spot. The captain was also injured, and the hull of the ship was severely damaged.</p>

Japan's newly appointed ambassador to Switzerland, Sakamoto, and Ono, an official from the Japanese Embassy in Lisbon, will also depart from Japan on the Kamakura Maru, stopping in Shanghai, and transfer to the original ship to go to Europe to take up their new posts. It is a first that diplomatic personnel are traveling on an evacuation ship.</p>
<p>Important British Nationals Departing Shanghai Today</p>
<p>Among the 167 British nationals in Shanghai who will be evacuated tomorrow are Sir Brooke-Popham and his wife, the Counselor for Chinese Affairs at the British Embassy, Mr. and Mrs. Maze, the former Inspector General of Customs, Mr. Rocherfort, the former Customs Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, Mr. Philip, the former Director General of the Municipal Council, Mr. Smouroff, the former Acting Chief of the Police Department, Mr. Robertson, the former Deputy Chief of the Police Department, Colonel Mann, the former Commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, Mr. Madden, the principal of Mow Tai &amp; Co., Mr. Hanselman, the manager of HSBC, Mr. Woodhead, the former editor of the Oriental Affairs Magazine, Mr. Finch, a reporter for the Daily Mail, and Mr. Bloom, the Pacific manager of Reuters News Agency. It is also reported that Miss Xingde, the director of the Industrial and Social Section of the Municipal Council, has resigned and is returning on the Kamakura Maru. Miss Xingde is Australian and is not yet 49 years old. She became involved in social work during her university days. She graduated from the Department of Social Sciences of the University of Sydney in 1913. She came to China in 1926 to study the conditions of factory workers. In 1933, she was hired by the Municipal Council to head the Industrial and Social Section.</p>
<p>British Nationals in Shanghai Evacuated First</p>
<p>The departure arrangements for the repatriated nationals have been completed. Civilians and officials will board the ship in batches, one after the other. The Japanese authorities have instructed civilians to gather at the Columbia Country Club at 2:00 PM this afternoon to have their luggage checked and receive their tickets. According to an official from the Japanese Consulate General, many British nationals in other cities who have been sent to Shanghai by the Japanese authorities will not be evacuated on the Kamakura Maru, but have been forced to wait for the next evacuation ship. The Japanese authorities originally intended to give priority to evacuating British nationals in other cities, because they did not enjoy the convenience and freedom of Shanghai British nationals. However, this plan was changed at the last minute at the request of London, which was forwarded by the Swiss Consulate. London requested that the Japanese authorities give priority to evacuating British nationals in Shanghai. Therefore, British nationals in other cities will temporarily reside at the Columbia Country Club to await the preparation of the fifth evacuation ship.</p>
<h3>Foreign Bank Clearing House to Implement New Measures Starting Today</h3>
<p>The Foreign Banks Association has amended the clearing rules to adopt a fine system in order to improve the efficiency of check clearing. It will be implemented starting today (Monday). The Bank Union Preparatory Committee has joined the clearing group. All receivables and payables between member banks and foreign banks will be handled by the committee. The clearing house is located within the Yokohama Specie Bank in Shanghai. The Specie Bank will send a clearing clerk to handle general matters within the clearing house. Participants in the clearing must open current accounts at the Specie Bank. The clearing difference will be paid or received from these current accounts. Negotiable instruments are checks, drafts, and matured term deposit certificates. If a member bank wants to pay cash from a current account with the Specie Bank, the Specie Bank has the right to request the bank owing the clearing difference to directly pay the cash to the requesting bank. The Specie Bank will then issue a check for the same amount to the paying bank so that the check can be deposited into the current account to offset the clearing difference. Non-member banks may be represented in the clearing by a member bank, but the clearing house must be notified two days in advance, and the following three points must be noted: 1. The non-member bank must send its signature samples to the participating clearing banks for verification; 2. The member banks submitting instruments for clearing have the right to request the bank submitting the instruments to verify the endorsement made by the non-member bank; 3. Rejected return instruments may be handled directly between each member bank and the non-member bank. Regarding the participation of the Shanghai Banking Association Preparatory Committee, which represents the clearing banks of the association, all "Foreign Bank Instruments" received by the clearing banks of the association will be submitted by the association for clearing. Rejected instruments submitted by the clearing banks of the association should be returned through the association. The detailed procedures have been published in the 15th issue of this newspaper.</p>
<h3>Subsidies for Private Schools to Be Distributed Today</h3>
<p>The Chinese Education Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council has historically allocated subsidies to private schools within the Settlement that are well-managed, and has designated them for the purpose of adding equipment and improving school buildings. It is now known that the second installment of subsidies for this year will begin to be distributed today (17th). All schools receiving subsidies can bring a formal letter of authorization from the school board and the school seal to the Chinese Education Office to sign, and then go to the general accounting office of the Municipal Council to collect the money. However, this year's autumn property tax must be paid, otherwise it will be deducted. Applications for next year's private school subsidies have already begun. Schools can obtain blank forms from the Education Office.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over the Sale of the Ji Ren Hospital in the French Concession</h3>
<p>A dispute over the sale of the Ji Ren Hospital on Rue Paul Beau in the French Concession has recently occurred. One of the main parties is Shao Ruxin, a Buddhist layman known for upholding the Dharma, and the other is Master Chi Song, a frequent speaker at Buddhist lectures. Although one is a layman and the other is a monk, both are Buddhists. According to a Great China News Agency reporter, the incident began because Chi Song (resident of the Guandi Temple on Danshui Road) planned to establish a Buddhist hospital, but lacked a suitable location. The Ji Ren Hospital on Rue Paul Beau happened to be in the process of closing down, and the hospital's director, Shao Ruxin, was a devout Buddhist. Therefore, through the mediation of another layman, Yu Jingbo, the entire hospital building was transferred to Chi Song for the purpose of establishing a Buddhist hospital, priced at 25,000 yuan, with 10,000 yuan paid in advance. The remaining amount would be paid after the tenants moved out and the property was handed over. Recently, a disagreement arose between Chi Song and Shao Ruxin. According to Shao Ruxin, the sale of the hospital building was conditional on both parties cooperating. Chi Song stated that it was not cooperation, but a transfer of the building. Each party held their own position and hired lawyers to publish advertisements attacking each other. According to a Great China News Agency reporter, the original receipt signed by Shao Ruxin for the sale of the Ji Ren Hospital stated: "Receipt issuer Shao Ruxin hereby transfers the entire site, assets, medicines, etc. of the Ji Ren Chinese and Western Hospital, as per the account book, to the Buddhist Hospital. The two parties agreed on a price of 25,000 yuan in savings certificates. 10,000 yuan in deposit is received first. The remaining 15,000 yuan will be paid upon the recovery and transfer of all the buildings by the receipt issuer. A formal receipt is made as proof for future reference. Shao Ruxin's blue chop. June 27th, 31st year of the Republic of China." It is now learned that both parties are undergoing mediation, which may prevent the matter from being litigated in court.</p>
<h3>Landlord Sued Over Rent Currency Dispute</h3>
<p>Kang Xingxiang, a local resident, is the owner of ten buildings at 15-17 Taiyuan Lane on Rue Brenier de Montmorand in the Public Concession. Before the war in Shanghai, he leased the buildings to Zhuo Huapu, a deceased Cantonese, to open the Yongxinglong Tea House. Later, due to the decline of business during the war, Zhuo Huapu seized the opportunity to sublet to various residents, reaching 24 households. The rooms on the first and second floors were like pigeon cages, with three tenants totaling 124 people. The rental income was quite substantial. The tea house had a contract with the owner Kang Xingxiang, which expired at the end of March this year. A new contract was renewed. At this time, the ratio of new currency to old currency was 77%. Because the rent from the landlord Kang Xingxiang was low, the new contract stated that the rent would not be divided into new and old legal tender, but would be paid in current legal tender without any discount. However, after the implementation of the new legal tender exchange rate of 2:1, Zhang Xintai, an apprentice of Zhuo Huapu of the Yongxinglong Tea House, suddenly regretted the agreement and hid a copy of the new contract. He claimed that the new contract held by Kang Xingxiang was forged and that the rent should be paid at half the value of the new legal tender. He hired a lawyer to sue Kang Xingxiang for forgery, requesting criminal punishment. Yesterday, Judge Zhao summoned the parties for questioning. Kang hired lawyer Zheng Lintong to defend him and counter-sued for false accusation. The court ordered a postponement for further verification.</p>
<h3>Ci Lian Relief Center Opens Two Refugee Workshops: Weaving Straw Sandals and Sewing Thread</h3>
<p>After the closure of the various refugee camps in Shanghai, over 800 elderly, weak, disabled, and orphaned people were housed in the Ji Yuan Refugee Center on North Zhejiang Road in April this year through a collaboration between the Municipal Council and the Ci Lian Relief Association. According to the collaboration plan, the Municipal Council provided supplies, and Ci Lian was responsible for management. On the 15th of last month, the Municipal Council stopped providing supplies to the Relief Center, and the Ci Lian Association took sole responsibility for managing it. In addition to soliciting donations from various sectors of society, the association was still short of funds. Therefore, it submitted a request to the Municipal Council yesterday to continue issuing supply fees. At the same time, in order to promote refugee production, the center added (1) a straw sandal workshop and (2) a thread bag workshop, each employing over 100 selected orphans and refugees to work. In addition, a horticultural area has been opened to grow vegetables, so that all refugees in the center, except for the disabled, can have work to do.</p>
<h3>Two Concession Authorities to Issue Third Batch of Rice Permits Today; Those Collecting Permits Must Bring Damaged Tickets; Seventh Period of Grain Distribution Begins Today</h3>
<p>After the two Concession Authorities implemented a per capita grain distribution system, they will issue the third batch of rice purchase permits starting today, Monday. This permit is divided into four sections, for the ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth periods. Residents of the Public Concession who are taxpayers can, according to the date noted on the back of their summer housing tax receipt, bring the receipt to the permit issuing office in their residential area to collect the rice purchase permit. The French Concession has already notified the heads of each Lianbao (neighborhood mutual guarantee system) via the police station to inform all taxpayers to bring their donation receipt to the designated location on the specified day to collect the rice purchase permit. Regarding the seventh period of grain collection, all contracted rice shops are prepared and will begin sales today. Holders of the seventh section of the second batch of rice purchase permits can purchase 1.5 Sheng (approx. 1.6 quarts) of white rice per section at a price of 3.8 yuan, with an optional purchase of 1 Jin (approx. 1.3 lbs) of flour at a price of 2.3 yuan, totaling 6.1 yuan. However, the purchase of flour is optional; rice shops must not force purchases.</p>
<h3>Essentials of Home Air Raid and Fire Protection (4)</h3>
<p>Yellow phosphorus can corrode the skin, so do not touch it with hands or feet. If it adheres to the skin, wipe it off with a 5% solution of sodium bicarbonate or a saturated solution of copper sulfate, and then treat it like a normal burn with tannic acid, etc. Incendiary bombs are often dropped together with explosive bombs and gas bombs. Therefore, those engaged in air defense must also have knowledge of protection against blast fragments, explosive force, or poisonous gas.</p>
<p>(C) Defense Against Fires Caused by Other Reasons: For fires caused by reasons other than incendiary bombs, the first requirement is early detection, direct water injection onto the source of the fire, and efforts to prevent the fire from spreading. For fires caused by oils and special chemicals that are not suitable for water injection, use appropriate fire extinguishers such as chemical foam extinguishers or carbon tetrachloride fire extinguishers to extinguish the fire, or cover the fire with sand or blankets.</p>
<p>(D) Defense When a Fire Has Already Occurred: After a fire occurs, directly inject water onto the burning area and work hard to extinguish the fire. If a fire occurs in a detached house (and there is no direct risk of it spreading to adjacent houses) and the home air defense team cannot extinguish it, focus on guarding against flying embers. If there is a possibility of spreading to adjacent houses, immediately work to prevent the spread. For houses connected to several others, water should be injected simultaneously from inside and outside the unburned parts, and efforts must be made to prevent the fire from spreading from the ceiling interlayer. When a fire occurs, pay attention to embers carried by the wind. (E) Essential Points of Firefighting Work: When engaged in firefighting work, be sure to wet your clothes beforehand. When injecting water, concentrate the use of all firefighting equipment such as lead buckets, portable pumps, well pumps, and tap water pipes. When using a lead bucket to inject water, hold the handle and edge of the bucket with one hand, and grasp the edge of the bottom of the bucket with the other hand, leaning forward slightly when pouring. The volume of water in the bucket should be about one-half to seven-tenths of the bucket's capacity. When multiple people are passing lead buckets of water, the distance between two people passing water should be about one and a half meters. However, the distance when returning the empty buckets can be greater. When passing water to the second floor or roof, use ropes to lower empty lead buckets. Sand and soil should be placed in bags with a capacity of about two liters. Fire bells and water ladles are used to watch for embers in high places. Long poles are used to break ceilings and floors, etc., or to move incendiary bombs.</p>
<p>(F) Essentials for Surveillance: After an air raid alarm is issued, each observation post should have one person on duty, rotating every thirty minutes or one hour. When a surveillance person discovers an enemy plane or hears the sound of bombs exploding, or after an enemy plane flies away, they should loudly notify the area. When an incendiary bomb is discovered, use metal instruments to make noise and loudly notify the area.</p>
<p>Other Protective Activities: (A) When there are injuries or deaths from bombing, those engaged in air defense should immediately notify the police station or ambulance station. (B) Make sure the flames are completely extinguished and prevent residual fires from reigniting. After extinguishing the fire, be vigilant for several more hours. (C) If an unexploded bomb is discovered, immediately set up a marker and cordon off the surrounding area with ropes to prevent pedestrians from approaching, and immediately notify the police authorities.</p>
<p>Actions After the Air Raid Alarm is Lifted: After the air raid alarm is lifted, each household's air defense person in charge should check the extent of the damage, implement emergency measures, and strengthen necessary preparations to prevent another air raid. (The End)</p>
<h3>Wife Sues for Divorce Because Husband Has Bad Habits</h3>
<p>Fan Baoying, a 25-year-old woman from Baoshan, currently works as a teacher at Zhabei Elementary School on Nanxing Road in Zhabei. In 1936, at the age of 19, she was betrothed by her parents to Jin Difu (33 years old, currently residing at 480 Kangti Road), who was from the same hometown. During the August 13th Incident the following year, Fan fled to Shanghai for refuge, and Jin took the opportunity to invite her to stay. He then requested to live together, agreeing to hold a wedding ceremony when the situation stabilized. At that time, Fan's parents agreed to his request and ordered their daughter to live with Jin. They have now had three daughters. Fan hoped that her fiancé would strive to improve and build a happy family together. However, Jin has become degenerate, having no occupation and indulging in bad habits. Despite repeated劝劝, he refuses to quit. He uses Fan's hard-earned money to supplement the family expenses, but shows no pity for Fan. Instead, he becomes violent, beating and scolding her. Fan has endured extreme mental suffering. Because she thought she must rely on him, and there would be a long future together, her lifelong happiness has been washed away. She feels it is difficult to stay married to him. Therefore, she hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the court against Jin to terminate the marriage contract and end the cohabitation relationship. The court hearing was held the other day. The defendant, Jin Difu, also arrived at court with his lawyer to defend himself, saying that he and the plaintiff had already married in their hometown, which can be proven by witnesses, and requested that the lawsuit be rejected. The court approved the request and ordered the case to be returned for further investigation and handling.</p>

The approved scholarship lists have been published in this newspaper since the 11th of this month. The elementary school group was published in full on the 11th, 12th, and 13th. Scholarship payments will begin today. The payment time is scheduled from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 4:30 PM daily. Those who did not qualify are also requested to come and retrieve their documents as soon as possible. Payments for the secondary school group are scheduled to begin on the 21st. Please pay attention. Applications for the university group and the free quotas for various schools are still being processed. Impoverished students should not miss this last chance.</p>
<p>Instructions for Collecting Payments</p>
<p>Scholarship checks approved for the elementary school group will be issued starting today. All approved applicants must, starting from the 17th, be accompanied by themselves or a parent to the office within one week, bringing their personal seal (i.e., the original seal affixed on the application form) to collect the check. Payments will not be issued after the deadline. All students whose names have been published on the list, if they need to change schools, please send a letter to the office immediately, stating the reasons for the required school change and requesting the change. Otherwise, once the check has been issued, no further changes can be made. After receiving the check, the school must be responsible for collecting the funds from the bank within two weeks. If the deadline is exceeded, the check will be void. If there are special reasons that require the check to be reissued and the newspaper agrees, the original check must be returned before the change can be made. If an applicant is unable to attend school for other reasons, the check must be returned as soon as possible. The original documents can be retrieved with the registration certificate.</p>
<p>Application Deadline Extended</p>
<p>The number of applicants for this year's university group has already exceeded twice the previous two times. After the application deadline, many impoverished university students continued to write letters requesting to extend the application deadline. After careful consideration by the scholarship committee members Shen Siliang, Chen Xuanren, Lu Gaoyi, and Zhao Zongyu on the 12th, it was deemed that assisting impoverished university students was more urgent than assisting elementary and secondary school students. It was decided to grant a special extension to the application deadline, from now until the 20th of this month. Applicants are allowed to continue obtaining application forms from the office and complete the application procedures. However, it must be specially noted that this application must be certified in writing by the university authorities as being of good character and academic standing and from an impoverished family to be eligible. There are few days left, so do not miss this last opportunity. As for elementary and secondary school students, requests to extend the deadline will not be granted.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Purge and Reconstruction Key Points</h3>
<p>Chen Gongbo, Chairman of the Shanghai Purge and Reconstruction Committee and President of the Shanghai Public Association, and Miyazaki, Head of the Shanghai Special Affairs Agency, jointly issued statements on the Shanghai Purge and Reconstruction, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Chen Gongbo, Chairman of the Shanghai Purge and Reconstruction Committee, issued a statement on the Shanghai Purge and Reconstruction, with four key points: The most important issue of the Purge and Reconstruction is that politics, military affairs, party affairs, social movements, and mass organizations must be unified. Only in this way can the organization of the Purge and Reconstruction be sound, and the mission of the Purge and Reconstruction can be achieved. From now on, after the Purge and Reconstruction is carried out, all political and military affairs must be subject to the supervision and command of the Purge and Reconstruction Committee. This is something that political workers and all soldiers and civilians should understand. The Chairman instructed that the Purge and Reconstruction must first purify the heart. Cadres and all personnel responsible for the Purge and Reconstruction should be honest and impartial, and work hard. Everyone must not disturb the people, and everyone must protect the people. Anyone who violates this principle will be dealt with according to military law. It is hoped that military and political personnel will understand this principle and not violate it. The Purge and Reconstruction is intended to support the people and ensure security and peace. It is hoped that the people will not only cooperate with the Purge and Reconstruction but also actively work hard to organize and develop the security, transportation, economy, education, etc. of the area. In this way, local security can be established, and political integrity can be expected. Those who deliberately disobey will also be executed according to military law. Those bandits and communists within Shanghai who are either blindly following or being coerced and disturbing the local area do not originally intend to do so. Once the Purge and Reconstruction begins, they should immediately show their sincerity and return. The government will not investigate their past actions and will arrange for their resettlement. If they stubbornly refuse to repent, the government will not tolerate them. During this Purge and Reconstruction, there will be no tolerance for those who disturb the local area. It is hoped that they will each return to farming or immediately show their sincerity and accept recruitment, and not violate the law and bring disaster upon themselves.</p>
<p>Miyazaki Shige Saburo, Head of the Shanghai Special Affairs Agency, issued a statement, stating that the construction of a new order in East Asia is China's important mission. Therefore, it is necessary to eliminate bad elements in China, reform politics, and stabilize people's livelihoods as a matter of urgency. Furthermore, in order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to implement the Purge and Reconstruction. If thorough purging is carried out in the military, political, economic, and cultural sectors of each district and town, the people will be able to live in peace in their hometowns, and officials and people will be able to enjoy prosperity. An ideal country can be reached in this way. The first phase of the Purge and Reconstruction in the Shanghai area will be implemented in the three areas of Nanhui, Fengxian, and Beiqiao under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Special Municipality. Military activities will be carried out to eliminate bandits and thieves in the area. Bamboo walls will be built according to the terrain to prevent the infiltration of undesirable elements and to prevent their political infiltration. In the past, sub-district offices, etc., were established below the district offices. Now, in order to achieve great success in the Purge and Reconstruction, in addition to implementing blockade management, working teams will be organized to be responsible for various matters related to the entry and exit of the area. It is hoped that the residents will understand the purpose of the Purge and Reconstruction in detail, lead by example, and cooperate to move forward together to achieve the goal of cooperation between officials and people.</p>

<h3>Operating Income and Capital Income, the Two Lifelines of Insurance Companies</h3>
<p>— Huai Xuan</p>
<p>—New Company Management Issues—</p>
<p>For any business, at the beginning of its establishment, there must first be meticulous budgets and arrangements for business operations. Otherwise, one should not engage in it rashly, especially for insurance companies. The main operating revenues of an insurance company are: Premium income from retained insurance amounts; Income from reinsurance premiums or commissions; Profits from capital utilization. Based on the above, we will formulate two plans for the insurance company's business plan. Now, assuming a company with a capital of 2.5 million yuan, the first plan is as follows:</p>
<p>Expenditure: Establishment fee of 100,000 yuan; recurring expenses of 30,000 yuan per month (assuming 30 employees).</p>
<p>Income: Net premium income of 100,000 yuan per month, of which 40,000 or 50,000 yuan is retained, and 60,000 or 50,000 yuan is ceded. 60,000 or 50,000 yuan returned.</p>
<p>Provisioning for reserves and expense components: Expenses account for 30% (i.e., 30,000 yuan); claims reserves account for 30% (i.e., 30,000 yuan). Reserve ratio percentage ten.</p>
<p>Based on the above estimates, the net income is sufficient to cover recurring needs. The capital of 2.5 million yuan, minus the establishment fee of 100,000 yuan, leaves 2.4 million yuan. This fund can be fully utilized for investment. According to the Insurance Law, the use of insurance funds and liability reserves is limited to the following: Deposits in banking institutions; Trust deposits; Loans secured by valid securities; Loans secured by life insurance policies (referring to the liability reserves of life insurance companies); Loans secured by real estate as first collateral; Investment in public bonds and corporate bonds; Investment in real estate. Therefore, the profit from the use of these funds can be used as the company's surplus.</p>
<p>Second Method: Assume that the company has just been established and there is no certainty in business operations. It would be impossible to rely on premium income to cover expenses. At a minimum, it must rely on the interest earned from capital utilization to cover expenses. That is, if the 1.4 million yuan in funds can earn a weekly interest rate of 1.5% or 2%, it will be sufficient to cover expenses. However, this is not the normal state of the insurance industry.</p>
<p>Is the insurance industry really emerging? How many can follow the first method and seek survival or development on the right track? I am afraid that nine out of ten will resort to the second method and seek to use their capital to get by.</p>
<p>This article was hastily written, and there may be omissions and inaccuracies. I hope readers will forgive me.</p>
<h3>Market Dynamics</h3>
<p>Government Bonds</p>
<p>Although the bond market has turned to recovery, the foundation still feels weak. Without new stimuli, the situation is not easy to clarify.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks</p>
<p>The market sentiment, which had been sluggish for consecutive weeks, showed a slight improvement, but it has not yet become widespread. The most colorful performer last week was the new pharmaceutical stock, with almost no exceptions. The rise and fall of new pharmaceutical stocks often has an exciting effect on the entire stock market. This opportunity may give the stock market some impetus in the future, or it may not be known. However, the interbank lending measures issued by the Silver Union Association evaluate Chinese stocks on the principle of not exceeding the face value. This has a considerable binding effect on general stock trading.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cloth</p>
<p>The situation for yarn has not improved, but people's hearts have become firmer. The prices of various grades of goods rose sharply last week, which was even more noticeable after August 13th, and deserves attention. At the end of the week, Lanfeng reached 5,300 yuan, and Shuangma Factory's single cloth also surpassed the spot price, once reaching a high price of 5,350 yuan. The fabric factory uniformly caught up. The Silver Union Association's recognition of goods for interbank lending is indeed a stimulant.</p>
<p>Western Medicine</p>
<p>The excellence of the new pharmaceutical stocks is a reflection of the improvement in the Western medicine market. The downward trend stabilized last week, and signs of a rebound began to appear. However, there is still nothing to be optimistic about in the environment.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>Grain trading is extremely chaotic, with both rises and falls. It is said that the distribution method has been determined, and the distribution price is calculated in military tickets. Tianjin soybeans are priced at 33.5 yuan each, Tianjin peanuts at 45.5 yuan each, Tianjin green beans at 28.5 yuan each, mung beans at 33.5 yuan each, and red beans at 29.5 yuan each.</p>
<h3>Outside the Venue Gossip</h3>
<p>According to a recent survey by a real estate company, the current market price of real estate in the city is highest in the central area of Nanjing Road at 1.2 million yuan per Mu (approx. 1/6 acre), and lowest in the West Shanghai area at about 100,000 yuan. The approximate prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Around the Yong'an and Xianshi Companies on Nanjing Road: 1.2 million yuan per Mu</p>
<p>Around Zhili Road and Xiangfen Lane on Nanjing Road: 700,000 to 800,000 yuan per Mu</p>
<p>Around Hartung Road and Seymour Road on Nanjing Road: More than 300,000 yuan per Mu</p>
<p>Central area of Xiafei Road in the French Concession: More than 300,000 yuan per Mu</p>
<p>Area west of Albert Road in the French Concession: 230,000 to 400,000 yuan per Mu</p>
<p>East of Yidingpan Road on Yuyuan Road in West Shanghai: 150,000 to 600,000 yuan per Mu</p>
<p>Area west of Yidingpan Road in West Shanghai: Around 100,000 yuan per Mu</p>

<h3>Nutrition and Mental Health</h3>
<p>— Da Fen</p>
<p>Some time ago, the YMCA held a nutrition exhibition that attracted considerable attention from the public. However, whether nutrition is sufficient or not is not only related to physical health but also closely related to mental health, especially Vitamin B1.</p>
<p>We generally know that a deficiency of Vitamin B1 can easily lead to beriberi. However, few realize its close connection to the psychological aspect. A slight deficiency of Vitamin B1 in the diet can make a person irritable and very easily angered. Consistent deficiency can result in discouragement, listlessness, and feelings of inferiority, among other things.</p>
<p>Women with normal emotional states, given a diet containing all nutrients except Vitamin B1, can begin to show psychological symptoms after two or three weeks. The longer the period, the more pronounced the symptoms become. These include an inability to concentrate, blurred memory, helplessness, shyness, inferiority complex, irritability, depression, and anxiety. Happy, sociable people become cold, lazy, and unwilling to cooperate.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can believe that some patients with so-called neurasthenia are actually suffering from malnutrition, particularly a deficiency of Vitamin B1. However, if a doctor uses vitamins to treat the illness, they often encounter resistance: patients may suspiciously ask, "Can vitamins cure diseases?" However, the answer is yes. Therefore, treatment of these conditions must be consistently paired with a diet containing appropriate nutrition. If certain weak symptoms are deeply rooted, treatment becomes more difficult.</p>
<p>Foods containing Vitamin B1 are not plentiful, with only grains, lean pork, peas, and soybeans containing some. If our diet lacks these foods, we will suffer from Vitamin B1 deficiency. However, much of the Vitamin B1 is lost in milled white rice and processed flour. Recently, however, there is a type of "nutritional flour" in the United States that contains sufficient Vitamin B1.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we now have reason to believe that Vitamin B1 is closely related to mental health. Whether other vitamins are also related to mental health remains to be studied.</p>
<h3>Red Bean Bun</h3>
<p>— Ye Tang</p>
<p>I bought a red bean bun from a Cantonese food stall to appease my hunger. Unexpectedly, after taking a bite, I discovered that the flour contained a lot of fine sand. This bun, containing both "red bean" and "sand," can truly be called a "red bean bun" in name and in fact.</p>
<p>Random Thoughts</p>
<h3>Sweet Dew</h3>
<p>— Tian Li</p>
<p>In the evening, I returned from my tutoring school. The weather was so hot that my underwear was soaked and stuck to my body. Of course, my mouth was also very thirsty because I had not had a single drop of water for nearly two and a half hours. So, I hurried back to the factory to enjoy the sweet dew I needed most at that moment: cold boiled water. The road from the school back to the factory, although not very short, was still only about three or four *li*. You can imagine how anxious I was on this journey! I wished I could reach the factory in one step, but in fact, the more you wanted to hurry, the more you felt the road was long and endless.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, there are actually many things to quench one's thirst: soda, orange juice, ice cream, shaved ice… these are all sold along the way. Why did I insist on cold boiled water? Oh, you must know that these cold drinks are not prepared for poor people like us! So, whenever I passed a refreshment shop, I didn't even dare to turn my head. Some people say that imagining plums can quench thirst. But I, on the contrary, think that looking at refreshment shops only increases my thirst. So, I quickened my pace, hoping to get to the factory sooner.</p>
<p>Finally, I reached the factory gate and immediately took out the box of cold boiled water that I had prepared before going to school. I gulped down ten mouthfuls in one breath. At this moment, my mouth was moistened by the water, and my whole body suddenly felt comfortable. I knew that I must be smiling. Because I felt satisfied, victorious, and happy.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat Through Wind and Rain</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(8) What to Do</p>
<p>Second Mrs. Ye had also suspected that Wei Cheng might have some unspeakable difficulties, so she didn't press him for details. Instead, she asked Ah Xing many questions. Ah Xing, of course, answered his mistress's questions truthfully, knowing what he knew and admitting what he didn't. Second Mrs. Ye said, "There's nothing else to worry about, except that in such cold weather, when you go out, you must prevent chilblains on your hands and feet." She truly regarded Wei Cheng as her own child, reaching out to touch his face and saying, "Isn't that so? Wei Cheng, your face was originally smooth, but now it's not right. Do you have cold cream in your room? When you wash your face, quickly rub some soap on it first, then apply some cold cream." Cui Zhen quickly chimed in, "If Cheng *di* needs it, I have it in my room. Anyway, Cheng *di* bought it for me." Although Cui Zhen told Wei Cheng this sincerely, she regretted it halfway through, thinking that since Cheng *di* bought it for me, why did I have to tell Second Aunt, especially with Magpie, Ah Yu, and others standing in the room. She felt a little regretful, and her face naturally felt hot and uncomfortable. But Wei Cheng replied quickly, saying, "Cui Zhen *jie*, I have it in my room." Only then did he cover it up.</p>
<p>Wei Cheng's clothes, having traveled with Wei Cheng once, were checked one by one by Cui Zhen upon his return. Wei Cheng said he needed to rest, so she spread a piece of Western dog skin blanket on the rattan chair he usually lay on in summer and asked him to lie down. Second Mrs. Ye said, "It's better to go to bed earlier. We can talk about everything tomorrow. In the future, Wei Cheng, don't run around randomly. When you run around with your legs, I feel like my heart is running around with you." Wei Cheng agreed and went to his room to sleep. Later, when Second Mrs. Ye wanted Wei Cheng to talk to her late at night, Wei Cheng came uninvited, alone, groping his way to Second Mrs. Ye's room in the dark. He gently called out "Aunt" outside the room, and Second Mrs. Ye replied. After Wei Cheng entered the room, he called out twice more. Second Mrs. Ye opened her eyes and knew it was Wei Cheng. He was wearing a thick velvet nightgown and said, "Aunt, I will tell you the reason why I must go to see my brother and sister Guo Qi and Guo Fang, while Cui Zhen *jie* is not here." (156)</p>

<h3>Miss School</h3>
<p>— Pan Shu Xian</p>
<p>The Misses in School</p>
<p>In the past, someone divided the students of three girls' schools in Hangzhou into three different classes: the students of the Provincial Girls' Middle School, with short hair and short skirts, simple and fond of sports, were the student faction; the students of another private, non-missionary girls' school, mostly older, loved to dress up but were not particularly neat, and liked to sing songs like "Peach Blossom River" with flattened throats, were called the "Jasper Faction"; and the students of the missionary girls' school, because they all wore *qipao*, sang Western songs, and were relatively quiet and generous, were called the "Miss Faction."</p>
<p>Not only was this the case in Hangzhou, but most missionary girls' schools in various places, with few exceptions, had the honorable title of "Miss School." And the misses who came out of these schools often aroused the interest of many leisurely classes.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, many socialites are students from missionary schools. They are all beautiful and generous, dressed elegantly and luxuriously, able to dance ethereal ballroom dances; able to speak fluent English; and most can play a little music. Recently, bicycles have become very popular. As long as you stand on the street and stare, among the ladies with the most beautiful bicycles, the most exquisite clothes, and the most carefully combed hair, nine out of ten are misses from missionary girls' schools.</p>
<p>However, it would be a big mistake to think that all the students in missionary girls' schools are like them. Indeed, because missionary girls' schools charge higher fees, the students are often from families with higher levels of education, better economic conditions, and a more Westernized education. Therefore, they may dress more neatly than some female students from non-missionary schools, but luxury is out of the question. Even in the most famous "Miss Faction" girls' middle school in Shanghai, most students still wear not-so-new cloth clothes. And when they see strangers, most of them are still shy and reserved, not like seasoned social butterflies.</p>
<p>In terms of academics, people often assume that students from missionary schools must be proficient in English and careless in Chinese. This is not entirely true either. Students from missionary schools, except for a very few whose English is indeed outstanding, are usually just average. In Chinese, because some missionary school authorities themselves do not have much research in Chinese, they often overcompensate in an attempt to wash away the bad reputation that "the Chinese level of missionary schools must be poor," and love to hire old gentlemen such as former Qing *gongsheng* or *xiucai* to teach Chinese. Of course, we cannot completely deny that these people are not qualified to be Chinese teachers in middle schools. There are not a few among them who have real talent and learning and are patient and encouraging. However, many *xiucai*, in addition to being able to recite the Four Books and Five Classics, do not understand what the "national essence" really is, let alone the teaching methods that can arouse students' interest in Chinese. Therefore, although students have to write classical Chinese compositions like "Man is born into the world" in the classroom, and even have to write old-style poems in seven-character or five-character lines, they often find themselves unable to write a smooth and generous ordinary vernacular letter in their daily lives. Of course, we can still cite many ladies from missionary schools who write good articles, but generally speaking, the Chinese level of missionary schools is mostly not as good as some non-missionary schools.</p>
<p>How did this happiness come about? It was because before going to school, I put hot boiled water in a large cup and let it cool. On the way back, I didn't dare to delay, and I walked to the factory in one breath. All of this was done by myself, and this happiness was also created by myself.</p>
<p>Although this is only a very small trivial matter, it gave me an inspiration. No matter what you want to do, as long as you have a plan, are not afraid of difficulties, and do not abandon your goal halfway due to the enticement of others, then if you keep working hard like this, you will definitely achieve your goal. When you achieve your goal, happiness will naturally belong to you as well.</p>
<h3>Truth</h3>
<p>— Lan Ke</p>
<p>One day, I saw a "mountain man" on the street carrying a gourd and holding a small flag, saying he was auctioning off truth. I couldn't help but feel a little angry at the fortune-teller's words. Truth has also become a common herb.</p>
<p>Truth is the creation of the ultimate good, so it is an action, not an emotion, let alone a fortune-teller's language.</p>
<p>If you want to achieve the ultimate good, the most convenient path is to benefit the majority of people and benefit the social group. Remember, it is to benefit others, not just to benefit yourself. Benefiting yourself only adds misfortune to others and causes chaos.</p>
