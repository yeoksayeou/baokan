<h3>青年會發起補助清寒學生膳食</h3>
<p>在青年會學生救濟委員會的幹事的地方看到了幾對窮學生的謝函我覺得非常的感動也覺得有點悲哀</p>
<p>這些學生都是高中以上的學生以前受過堂征求救濟委員會的濟助的這幾封信的內容都是大同小異的首先對於該委員會過去的救濟與幫忙表示衷心的感謝接著說可是我現在已經不能享受貴會的恩惠了因為我的肺部已經發現了黑色的斑點醫生診斷為肺病必須停學療養了最後對於該會的工作又表示深心的感佩</p>
<p>最令人感到驚異的就是這些窮學生都患了肺病都因患了肺病而不能繼續求學</p>
<p>記得去年本埠有一所大學檢查身體的結果發現了一個驚人人的事實就是該校有百分之七十的學生患了肺癆</p>
<p>據有一位大學生親自告訴我他本季學費花二百四十元膳食每月卻要花三百塊錢以四個月為一季計膳費需要一千二百元</p>
<p>以上這幾件事實顯示了以下幾點㈠膳費比學費貴上好幾倍㈡患肺癆的學生多這就是說學生多數營養不足㈢勞學生因膳費昂貴營養更成問題㈣學費有人救濟膳費無人幫忙</p>
<p>學生救濟委員會有鑒於此特於去年發起學生膳食補助的辦法特約青年會主辦的學生食堂幫助一部份清寒學生解決吃飯問題目的如下㈠補助眞正清寒的學生一部膳費㈡特別注意學生膳食的營養㈢注重清潔培養自動的習慣</p>
<p>以上幾點已經得到了令人滿意的成績了</p>
<p>今年物價更形昂貴學生救濟委員會為繼續已往的事工並彌補這日漸擴大的缺憾起見特發起學生膳食補助募款運動以五萬元為本季目標希望可以幫助三百清寒學生</p>
<p>可以得到該會膳食補助的學生資格如下㈠中學以上的學生眞正清寒家庭的子弟㈡品學優良經學校當局為以證明者</p>
<p>凡有意請求補且膳食中清寒學生自九月十七日起到二十四日止可向青年會學生救濟委員會登記登記地點星期一三五下午二時至五時在八仙橋青年會星期二四六下午二時至五時在威海衛路六三八號女青年會</p>
<p>社會上不乏熱心愛護青年的人士希望會熱烈響應這個補助清寒學生膳食的運動竟助學之全功收款地點㈠八仙橋青年會㈡威海衛路六三八號女青年會</p>

<h3>人生商場</h3>
<p>— 林保</p>
<p>熙熙攘攘的世界是一個大商場世界上的每一個人都是商人</p>
<p>我們的遺傳環境教育時間空間機會財產以及衣食住行合成了我們的資本我們得利用這些資本去做生意</p>
<p>有人懶惰不去經營結果把資本吃光用盡一無所有</p>
<p>不善經營的人不但把自己的資本虧光了還要蝕到別人的資本</p>
<p>善於做生意的人盡量利用他的資本在人生的商場上去經營擘劃他利用機會賺了大錢成為人生商場上的一個富商巨買</p>
<p>可是人生商場上的經商不是自私自利的不是損人利已的而是合作互助利人利已的</p>
<p>所以人生商場上的貧富不是用銀行的存款計算的也不是用市內的地產測量的更不是用生活的奪得侈來估計的而是用對於社會人羣的貢獻來判斷的</p>
<p>因此在人生的商場上成功的不一定富有富有的不一定是成功</p>
<p>生意越興隆歸還給社會的越多因為社會是我們的老闆</p>
<h3>塗奶油的鮮花</h3>
<p>— 小英</p>
<p>我是一朵鮮花而且最近我已變成一朵舉行過了奶油的鮮花了啊不是嗎你看我不是舉行著香粉煙脂蔻丹這些是我不願意幹的事情但又有什麼辦法</p>
<p>大約是一個多月前的一個早上母親向我說阿雪舅媽已替你找到了職業是他費了多人的力說情來的要懂得謀事的艱難更要懂得生活的困苦你必須好好忍耐著什麼重大事情似地悄悄地向我說你已是二十歲的人了二十歲的姑娘恰似一朵鮮花要留神外面那些浮蜂浪蝶啊</p>
<p>所以當舅舅領我進公司見人事科長的那天我特地卸下心愛的淡紅的泡泡紗旗袍換上一件較新些的素色洋紡的我懷著一顆忐忑不安的心依照舅舅預先的囑咐謹愼地向他鞠著躬叫聲Ｘ先生他點點頭向我瞧了一眼說不錯然而又縐著眉頭告訴舅舅這樣打扮是像學校裹唸書的這裹不興必須必須他沉吟了一下說必須塗點奶油纔是之後他告訴舅舅過一星期再來回家去準備準備現在不坊帶你甥女上下去兜兜看看人家怎樣塗奶油的</p>
<p>抱著懊喪的情緒看遍了樣品我是憤然了脫口告訴舅舅我不會也不愛塗奶油寗願不做但是繼著我迅快地推悉了自己的提議說讓我試試看吧因為我記起了母親說的更要懂得生活的艱苦的話來了</p>
<p>我於是跑公司偷偷地勤奮地學習學習塗化粉塗胭脂塗蔻丹學習捲頭髪學習穿緊裹的旗袍學習赤腳這樣我纔有資格忝入公司的女職員之列</p>
<p>有一次一個買客在櫃外對我緊瞅了足足已五分鐘還不見有走的意思我的心頭卜卜的跳起來了裝做整理壁櫉裹的貨品我背過臉去一起一伏的動擺著但他似乎不能再看真切發怒地喃喃幾咕自家打扮得妖裹妖氣還要像煞有介事搭臭架子花瓶我幾乎氣得想哭但我咬著牙忍住了</p>
<p>是我要當花瓶嗎是我要塗奶油嗎現社會不準我們女人單靠勞力換飯吃我們要吃飯不得不當花瓶塗奶油塗得嬌裹嬌氣呀</p>
<p>這種苦衷有誰能夠了解呢到幾時我們女人纔能真真單靠勞力在社會上立足呢</p>

<h3>Nanjing City Field Tax to be Doubled for One Year</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Due to the soaring prices after the incident, the Nanjing Municipal Government found municipal finances greatly strained.  However, the original field tax revenue was levied according to the tax rate set before the incident.  To balance income and expenditure and adapt to the changing environment, the city government planned to request that the Nanjing field tax be doubled to supplement municipal finances.  The request was submitted to the Executive Yuan, which ordered the Ministry of Finance to review and respond.  It is reported that the Ministry of Finance considered the city's field tax still based on pre-incident levels, which differed significantly from current prices.  Doubling the field tax was deemed necessary.  However, for the sake of caution, it was decided to implement a one-year trial period.  The Ministry of Finance will separately formulate field tax rates to standardize them. The Ministry of Finance has submitted its reply to the Executive Yuan and instructed the municipal government to take note.  It is also learned that the Guangdong Provincial Government, due to the significant disparity between the field tax amount and current prices, has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to double the levy.  It is reported that the Executive Yuan has approved the request, adopting Nanjing's approach for a one-year trial period to provide relief.</p>

<h3>Fighting in Stalingrad Becomes More Intense, Soviets Deploy Fresh Troops for Major Counteroffensive, Fierce Fighting Continues in Voronezh</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 20th (Havas Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>The battle for Stalingrad intensifies. After deploying a large number of fresh troops, the Red Army has launched a major counteroffensive. The Red Army's general headquarters is absolutely determined to relieve the pressure on the city, as evidenced by this. However, according to German sources, German forces in the area between the Don and Volga rivers have been attacked by enemy tank units, with several gaps created at certain locations, which were quickly filled. The Red Army's objective is to establish contact with the defending forces in the city. The Red Army may launch another offensive. Street fighting within the city continues fiercely. German advances are difficult. The German Air Force continues to bomb the city, leaving bombed areas scorched. Although the Red Army has suffered heavy losses, its resistance has not weakened. To prolong the war, the Red Army seems willing to make any sacrifice, and it is rumored that Stalingrad has been cut in two for five days, but this has not been officially confirmed by Germany. In the Voronezh area, the Red Army is concentrating its efforts on launching an offensive and has occupied two villages north and south of the city. In Maliyov city on the west bank of the Don, street fighting also broke out yesterday. Under the cover of tanks, the German forces counterattacked no fewer than eight times. In addition, in the Mostdok area, General Kleist, commander of the German tank unit, has been killed in action. The German 111th and 310th divisions have suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>German Headquarters, 20th (Haitong Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>This afternoon, the German war bulletin stated that fighting within the Stalingrad area is fierce. Soviet reinforcements moving south from the north have failed to achieve their objectives. The enemy forces in Voronezh have suffered heavy losses, and their suicidal charges have been repelled.</p>
<p>Moscow, 19th (Havas Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>The Red Army General Headquarters issued a war bulletin stating that our troops continued to fight in the Leningrad and Mostdok areas tonight. There were no major changes in other war zones.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Haitong Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>After bitter fighting, German forces in Stalingrad have entered the port area, which is a Soviet stronghold. At that time, German combat engineers used flamethrowers. The oil refinery in the area has been destroyed by German aircraft and artillery. Simultaneously, German infantry, combat engineers, armored units, grenadiers, and direct-fire artillery units continue to advance. Soviet forces are still attempting to reinforce the defending Soviet troops, sheltering in destroyed residences and factories to suddenly attack German forces. Soviet troops are attacking from the north in an attempt to relieve the siege of Stalingrad, with the Volga River serving as part of the Soviet defensive line. Seventy-seven Soviet aircraft were shot down over Stalingrad the day before yesterday, demonstrating the intensity of the aerial combat. On the evening of the 17th, Soviet forces attempted to land on the Motovsky Bay on the Soviet northern island but were repelled by German forces. Soviet attempts to land in the Lizza Bay were also repelled by artillery fire.</p>
<p>Soviet border area, 19th (Havas Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>According to German military experts here, two-thirds of the Stalingrad area is in German hands, so the battle for the city has now entered the mopping-up phase. However, the Red Army still holds important positions inside and outside the city, especially in the west and northwest of the city. The German troops that have entered the city have cut the Red Army into several sections. German forces are gradually advancing through the groups of fortresses converted from civilian houses. The fighting is more intense than before. Yesterday, however, it was claimed that the Red Army had recovered three large factories, and in recent days, heavy rains have fallen on the front lines, making the roads muddy and slowing the German advance. However, this type of weather is also unfavorable to the Red Army. The artillery units on the left bank of the Volga River are also less active than in the past. On the German side, however, there are constant attempts to cross the Volga River by force to neutralize the Soviet artillery and cut off the Red Army's only escape route. But to date, none of the German attempts have been successful. In short, the battle for the city appears to be nearing its end. Both sides are fighting resolutely, ignoring the difficulties caused by the prolonged warfare. But in any case, both sides are exhausted and cannot last. In addition, the Stalingrad area is very cold, especially at night, and the cold air is detrimental to the fighting.</p>
<h3>Two Soviet Generals Killed in Action</h3>
<p>Moscow, 20th (Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Moscow Radio announced that two Soviet generals have been killed in action: Lieutenant General Grobov and Lieutenant General Mishukov, both artillery officers.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>The German High Command has officially denied Soviet reports that General Kleist, commander of the German First Tank Corps, has been killed in action. It is claimed that General Kleist is currently leading his mechanized corps from the Mostdok area to attack the Grozny oil fields, about 50 miles southeast of the area. According to a Soviet communiqué, General Kleist was killed in action in the Mostdok area of the Caucasian industrial area.</p>
<h3>Two More Cities in Madagascar Captured, British Forces Only Ninety Miles from Island's Capital</h3>

<p>London, 19th (Havas Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>According to a dispatch from General Platt, commander of British forces in Madagascar, our forces were victorious in a battle with French forces south of the city of Ataripa. Although the advance has slowed somewhat due to various obstacles, it continues to move forward. Our forces departing from Mahajanga have reached the north of Angosobe, only ninety miles from the capital, and are sending reinforcements to defeat the French resistance. Those who landed at Tamatave two days ago are now advancing towards the central area of the island, so the island's capital is simultaneously threatened from the east. However, our forces advancing south from Diego Suarez are encountering difficulties due to the French forces having burned all the bridges and placed various obstacles in the path of our advance.</p>

<p>The Jin Cheng Bank Tongde Society Sports Division holds an annual invitational basketball league. Teams from Jin Cheng Bank, Taiping Insurance Company, Chengfu Trust Company, Xinyu Textile Company, Tongcheng Company, and others participate. Yesterday (the 20th), the opening of the third league took place. The competition started at 9:00 AM at the Society's basketball court. Over 500 members, family members, and guests from various industries attended, creating an unprecedented grand occasion. Three exhibition matches were also held to add to the excitement, inviting men's and women's basketball teams. The first match was between the famous HaiShang women's basketball team, Youdui, and Chong'ai Youdui. Youdui's forwards Liu Zhenbao, Huang Minghuan, and Yan Weiwen scored consecutively. Although Chong'ai had top players Rong Shujian and Li Yunzhi, they lost 11-30 due to a lack of practice. The second match was between Liancheng and Baifu. The two teams were evenly matched, and Baifu won 16-8 by a narrow margin. The final match was between Taiping and Chengfu. Taiping was the first champion of the Tongde Society, and Chengfu was the second champion. The two strong teams meeting each other created a tense atmosphere. The score constantly hovered around one or two points. However, due to time constraints, the exhibition was not able to finish and end with enjoyment.</p>
<h3>Chief Watanabé Talks in Tokyo, Security Foundation of Shanghai Established</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Domei News Agency dispatch) The Police Commissioner of the Shanghai Public Concession, Watanabe, has made great contributions to the establishment of security in the concession since taking office. Watanabe returned to his country on the 11th due to official business. The reporter at the Imperial Hotel especially visited him and was told the general situation in Shanghai as follows: After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, terrorist incidents in the Shanghai Public Concession disappeared. In the past, the average number of criminal cases per month was more than 2,232, but in July of this year, it was reduced to about 1,770, and the cases were very minor. Since the promotion of the Bao-jia organization and self-defense corps in March, and the strict investigation of households and the implementation of general household registration, the foundation for establishing security has been laid. In the future, with the cooperation of all parties, order will surely quickly become normal, and the prosperity of the market will also rapidly progress.</p>

<h3>YMCA Initiates Subsidy for Impoverished Students' Meals</h3>
<p>I saw several thank-you letters from poor students in the office of the Student Relief Committee of the YMCA, and I felt very touched and a little sad.</p>
<p>These students are all high school students or above who have previously sought assistance from the relief committee. The contents of these letters are all very similar. First, they express their sincere gratitude for the committee's past relief and assistance. Then, they say, "But I can no longer enjoy the benefits of your society because black spots have been found in my lungs. The doctor diagnosed me with lung disease and I must stop studying and recuperate." Finally, they express their deep admiration for the work of the society.</p>
<p>What is most surprising is that these poor students all suffer from lung disease and cannot continue their studies because of lung disease.</p>
<p>I remember that last year, a university in this city conducted a physical examination and discovered a shocking fact: 70% of the students in the school suffered from tuberculosis.</p>
<p>A university student personally told me that his tuition fee for this semester costs 240 yuan, but his meals cost 300 yuan per month. With four months in a semester, meal expenses amount to 1,200 yuan.</p>
<p>The above facts reveal the following points: ㈠ Meal expenses are several times more expensive than tuition fees. ㈡ Many students suffer from tuberculosis, which means that most students are undernourished. ㈢ Poor students have even more nutritional problems due to the high cost of meals. ㈣ Tuition fees are subsidized, but meal expenses are not.</p>
<p>In view of this, the Student Relief Committee specially initiated a student meal subsidy program last year. The student cafeteria organized by the YMCA helps a portion of impoverished students solve their meal problems. The objectives are as follows: ㈠ Subsidize a portion of the meal expenses for truly impoverished students. ㈡ Pay special attention to the nutrition of students' meals. ㈢ Emphasize cleanliness and cultivate automatic habits.</p>
<p>The above points have already achieved satisfactory results.</p>
<p>This year, prices are even higher. In order to continue past efforts and make up for this growing shortfall, the Student Relief Committee has launched a student meal subsidy fundraising campaign with a target of 50,000 yuan for this semester, hoping to help 300 impoverished students.</p>
<p>The qualifications for students to receive the society's meal subsidy are as follows: ㈠ Students above the middle school level who are truly children from impoverished families. ㈡ Students with good character and academic performance who have been certified by the school authorities.</p>
<p>Any impoverished students who intend to request a meal subsidy can register with the Student Relief Committee of the YMCA from September 17th to 24th. The registration locations are the YMCA at 8 Xianqiao on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM and the YWCA at 638 Weihaiwei Road on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>There is no shortage of enthusiastic people in society who care for young people. It is hoped that they will enthusiastically respond to this campaign to subsidize the meals of impoverished students and help students in their studies. Collection locations: ㈠ YMCA at 8 Xianqiao ㈡ YWCA at 638 Weihaiwei Road</p>
<h3>Shen Bao Reader's Scholarship Donation Report</h3>
<p>The Shen Bao Reader's Scholarship fund deeply appreciates the generous donations from the actor department of the China United Film Production Company, a group of children, and the Qingan Drama Society.</p>
<p>To the esteemed editor, our company, in order to restrict actors from participating in opening ceremonies or ribbon-cutting events, requires a donation of 5,000 Central Reserve Bank notes for each appearance as a charitable act, to be distributed by the actor to various charitable organizations. When the Mei Er Lian Shoe Company opened, they invited actresses Zhou Manhua and Chen Juanjuan to cut the ribbon. The company, in compliance with the regulations, provided Ms. Zhou and Ms. Chen with 5,000 Central Reserve Bank notes. After donating the funds to the Shanghai Disabled Persons' Home and the Orphanage, there was a remaining balance of one hundred yuan. We respectfully transfer this amount to your scholarship fund. Please verify and issue a receipt for our records. Sincerely, Actor Department of the China United Film Production Company, September 17th.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, Since your newspaper started the scholarship fund, the enthusiastic donations from all sectors of society have been truly heartening. We have always wanted to contribute, but we are all children, none of us even sixteen years old, and we have no financial power. Later, we thought of using the opportunity to perform in plays to raise funds from our relatives and friends. Now we have finally achieved our wish and have raised a total of 277 yuan. We are now presenting the entire amount to the scholarship fund. Although the amount is small, our intention is simply to use it as a stepping stone to encourage more significant contributions. We wish you well. A group of children, Yang Zhaowen, Li Rongjie, Cheng Shidi, Cheng Zhongguang, Yang Zonglin, Yang Zongmian, Yang Hengyi, Hengwen, Guo Yueming, Yang Hengxi, Yang Hengbi, Yang Hengqiang, together.</p>

<h3>Football Season Opens: Tunghwa Draws with St. Francis</h3>
<p>Two to Two, One Goal Each in the First Half</p>
<p>The first sound of autumn football: Tunghwa and St. Francis kicked off the football season at the racecourse yesterday at 5 PM. The match was tense and the performance was excellent. Each team scored one goal in the first half and one goal in the second half, resulting in a 2-2 draw.</p>
<p>Tunghwa Performance</p>
<p>Dai Linjing, Jia Youliang, and Han Longhai were the best players yesterday. Zhang Banglun, Zhuang Youren, and Zhang Zhaopeng were also good. Yuan Kun and Tian Shouren were closely guarded and could not fully demonstrate their skills. Gem Wahda of St. Francis was the most outstanding player, scoring both goals. The second goal, a solo effort, broke through two defenses and was a brilliant performance. Fuen was still an experienced veteran. The audience reached over 5,000 people.</p>
<p>Two Army Contact</p>
<p>Tunghwa's attack was unsuccessful. After seven minutes, Dai Linjing got the ball and shot hard. The St. Francis goalkeeper was careless and missed, but the ball hit the crossbar. St. Francis turned misfortune into blessing. Griffith passed to Gem Wahda who was unable to exert influence within ten-yard shooting position, however, Gem Wahda's shot hit the mark. In less than two minutes, Han Longhai tried a shot from thirty yards and miraculously scored, making it 1-1. Twenty minutes later, St. Francis' Greenburg committed a foul and a penalty was awarded. Ah Dai shot the ball, which hit a body and bounced out of bounds. The battle was fierce and each team had excellent opportunities, but both were unable to take advantage of them. In the dark, after eighteen minutes, Gem Wahda attacked alone as if entering an uninhabited area, and Zhang Banglun could not save it. At fifty minutes, Tunghwa's Dai Linjing, with the help of Zhang Mingsheng, scored from fifteen yards to tie the game. Time expired, Tunghwa 2, St. Francis 2.</p>

<p>Economic Special Issue, No. 432</p>
<p>Market Trends</p>
<p>Government Bonds Surge</p>
<p>The most significant feature of the bond market last week was breaking the old concept of 20% of face value, with all bonds jumping above the 50 yuan mark. Unified Class A and B bonds both rose above 56 yuan, Class C bonds reached 55 yuan, and Class D and E bonds both reached 53 yuan. From a psychological perspective within the bond market, this is quite interesting. However, in terms of the purchasing power of money, bondholders are still at a disadvantage compared to holders of goods or general stocks. Regardless of their motivation, bondholders are cooperators in the nation's finances. If the country does not perish, the government will always need to issue bonds. How can it be in the government's interest to sacrifice the interests of bondholders? Given this principle, the future direction of both markets can be imagined.</p>
<p>The newly established so-called Public Bond Fund Management Committee is said to be chaired by Hou Yuan, with members including Wang Huailian and ten others. Although the management focus may temporarily be limited to the 1.5 billion yuan of Stability Finance Public Bonds issued in Nanjing, before the true situation is clear, the rumors circulating in the market about redemption and reorganization are worth noting.</p>
<p>Regarding the organizational issues of the public bond market, the formal handover procedures between the old and new trade associations were completed last Wednesday, marking the end of a phase. The original Securities Association has transferred all its business to the Securities Trade Association, which is currently being established. The new association is expected to open within days, inheriting the original business and also handling Chinese stock trading.</p>
<h3>Settlement of Foreign Stocks</h3>
<p>Unsettled foreign stocks from before December 8th of last year have become a pending case. With the approval of the authorities, the settlement price will be based on the average price from the 1st to the 5th of that month, and will be combined at a rate of 20% of face value into savings certificates. The average prices have been calculated as follows (unit: legal currency yuan):</p>

<h3>Stagnant Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Compared to the soaring government bonds last week, the Chinese stock market was indeed lackluster, even more stagnant than the previous week. Was this a period of consolidation after a sharp rise, or was it due to the tightening of finances during the Mid-Autumn Festival? Various factors are at play.</p>
<p>The overall trend for the week was initially weak, then firm, and finally softened again, showing how volatile the market sentiment was. This is also a common phenomenon after market prices have risen too much. The main external pressure currently centers on the regulations. It is said that the situation has improved slightly after multiple negotiations, but because the negotiations have been going on for a long time, they have lost their stimulating effect on the market.</p>
<p>Among financial and industrial stocks, some showed relatively strong performance last week. Textile and pharmaceutical stocks also saw a gradual stabilization. Department store stocks, which overreacted in the previous week, were in a state of natural adjustment last week and lacked luster. This controlled rise and fall may continue for some time.</p>
<h3>Yarn, Cloth, Wool</h3>
<p>The market for yarn, cloth, and wool continues to be strong, especially towards the weekend. Phoenix brand reached 5,150 yuan, Horse brand reached over 5,700 yuan, and Dragon Head brand reached 177 yuan. Only the Four Gentlemen remained weak and sluggish. Most other factory cloths also improved, and wool even gained an advantage. This situation has continued for a considerable period. Could there be something else brewing in the future?</p>
<p>The most difficult problem for the textile industry is the difficulty of obtaining raw materials. Last week, the Sino-Japanese Hua Zhong Cotton Control Association was established, with Mr. Tsutsumi of the Japanese Textile Industry Association as chairman and Mr. Tong Luqing of Shen Xin Spinning Mill as vice chairman. The board of directors has ten members, including Jiang Shangda of Minfeng, Guo Ditian of Wing On Third Factory, Li Shengbo of Cheng Yun, and Guo Jianying of Anda. The board of supervisors has four members, including Yan Qingxiang of Su Lun and Li Wenjie of Chang Tai Cotton. The association will be responsible for the purchase and distribution of cotton produced in Central China and will manage cotton prices. It is said that the principle for distributing raw cotton in the future will be based on the average allocation per spindle. According to experts, Chinese factories currently own about 35% of all spindles in the Central China region, so Chinese factories can obtain 30% of the total cotton production in Central China. It is said that the difficulties caused by not obtaining raw cotton can be reduced in the future. Therefore, the establishment of this association should provide a stable force for yarn and cloth prices. However, if the opposite is true, the relevant authorities have paid close attention.</p>
<h3>Off-Market Chat</h3>
<p>The Japanese-owned China Insurance Association is currently accepting applications from Chinese and other foreign businesses to join and reorganize. It is currently being reorganized by seven companies, including the Japanese Maritime Fire Insurance Company. The Japanese Maritime Fire Insurance Company was elected as the chairman of the reorganization committee. The goal of the reorganization is to establish a strong organization to exercise comprehensive guidance over the entire insurance industry in Shanghai.</p>
<p>After the flow of funds concentrated on Chinese stocks, research materials on Chinese stocks emerged. Some people asked me to recommend a few books, but there were very few satisfactory ones. The "Summary of Chinese Stocks" compiled and published by Mr. Wang Xiangqin for Xingye Stock Number is arguably the best one.</p>
<p>The activities of the Japanese Yasuda-affiliated insurance conglomerate in Shanghai are characterized by joint ventures with Chinese businesses. For example, the Anli Maritime Insurance Company, which was previously planned, is a joint venture between the Yasuda group and a certain Chinese business. Now, the Tokyo Fire and Imperial Maritime companies of the Yasuda group have also jointly established a new company with Mr. Chen Bofan.

<h3>The Marketplace of Life</h3>
<p>— Lin Bao</p>
<p>The bustling world is a large marketplace, and everyone in the world is a merchant.</p>
<p>Our genetic inheritance, environment, education, time, space, opportunities, property, and basic needs like clothing, food, housing, and transportation constitute our capital. We must use this capital to do business.</p>
<p>Some people are lazy and do not manage their capital, resulting in its depletion and a state of nothingness.</p>
<p>Those who are not good at managing their capital not only lose their own capital but also encroach upon the capital of others.</p>
<p>Those who are skilled at doing business make full use of their capital to operate and plan in the marketplace of life. They seize opportunities, make a lot of money, and become wealthy merchants in the marketplace of life.</p>
<p>However, conducting business in the marketplace of life is not about being selfish and self-serving, nor is it about benefiting oneself at the expense of others. Instead, it is about cooperation, mutual assistance, and benefiting both oneself and others.</p>
<p>Therefore, wealth and poverty in the marketplace of life are not measured by bank deposits, nor by the amount of real estate one owns, nor by the extravagance of one's lifestyle. Instead, they are judged by one's contributions to society and the community.</p>
<p>Thus, in the marketplace of life, success does not necessarily equate to wealth, and wealth does not necessarily equate to success.</p>
<p>The more prosperous the business, the more one returns to society, because society is our boss.</p>
<h3>Flowers with Butter</h3>
<p>— Xiao Ying</p>
<p>I am a flower, and recently, I have become a flower covered in butter. Oh, isn't that right? Look, aren't I covered in face powder, rouge, and nail polish? These are things I don't want to do, but what can I do?</p>
<p>About a month ago, one morning, my mother said to me, "Ah Xue, your aunt has found you a job. It took him a lot of effort to plead for you. You must understand the difficulty of finding a job and the hardship of life. You must be patient." As if it were a very important matter, she quietly said to me, "You are already twenty years old. A twenty-year-old girl is like a flower. Be careful of those frivolous bees and butterflies outside."</p>
<p>So, the day my uncle led me into the company to meet the personnel director, I deliberately took off my beloved light red poplin cheongsam and put on a newer, plain-colored rayon dress. With a nervous heart, I carefully bowed to him as my uncle had instructed me beforehand and called out, "Mr. X." He nodded, glanced at me, and said, "Not bad," but then frowned and told my uncle, "Dressing like this is like a student in school. This isn't the style here. You must... you must..." He pondered for a moment and said, "You must put on some butter first." Then he told my uncle to come back in a week to prepare. "Now, you might as well take your niece around to see how people put on butter."</p>
<p>Holding onto my frustrated emotions, I looked at the samples and became furious. I blurted out to my uncle that I wouldn't and didn't like putting on butter and would rather not do it. But then, I quickly retracted my suggestion and said, "Let me try it," because I remembered my mother's words about the hardship of life.</p>
<p>So, I ran to the company to secretly and diligently learn how to apply face powder, rouge, and nail polish, how to style my hair, how to wear tight-fitting cheongsams, and how to go barefoot. Only then was I qualified to join the company's female staff.</p>
<p>Once, a customer stared at me outside the counter for a full five minutes without showing any sign of leaving. My heart pounded in my chest. I pretended to be arranging the goods in the wall cabinet and turned my back, swaying from side to side. But he seemed unable to see clearly and angrily muttered to himself, "You dress up so seductively and still put on airs like you're something special. A vase." I almost wanted to cry, but I gritted my teeth and endured it.</p>
<p>Did I want to be a vase? Did I want to put on butter? Today's society doesn't allow us women to rely solely on labor to earn a living. If we want to eat, we have to be vases, put on butter, and act coquettishly.</p>
<p>Who can understand this predicament? When will we women truly be able to stand on our own feet in society by relying solely on our labor?</p>

<h3>A Glimpse into the Money Shop Industry</h3>
<p>— Yi Wei</p>
<p>㈠ Old Seniors of the Financial World</p>
<p>New York in America has Wall Street, which is where banking giants concentrate, secretly holding the financial hub of the entire US and even the world. If you don't mind me making an inappropriate comparison, Shanghai also has its Wall Street, which is the eastern part of Ningbo Road in the Public Concession, from Sichuan Road in the east to Shanxi Road in the west, including Tianjin Road and Beijing Road to the north and south. Within this relatively small area, money shops, banks, money exchange shops, and similar financial institutions like trust companies and insurance companies are concentrated like beehives, door to door. Because the storefronts are limited, even the alleys are penetrated by several money shops. Don't underestimate them; the entire city of Shanghai isn't it the financial hub of all of China and isn't it grasped by the giants here? But one thing is not quite the same as abroad, that is, the new financial organizations, banks, at most can only grasp a small part of the power here, and a large part is still in the hands of its old seniors in the money shop industry.</p>
<p>Saying old seniors is not bragging for the money shop industry, every book studying the financial history of China will tell you that before the earliest bank, the China General Chamber of Commerce was established, money shops had already established a very solid foundation in Shanghai and major cities. Its history is at least two hundred years or more. Its predecessor was transformed from a bill shop specializing in remittance business, but the development in the last hundred years is closely related to the economic aggression of imperialists such as Britain and America, because after foreign capital invaded China, it was unfamiliar with the people and land and needed to use the relationship between money shops and the business community to carry out transactions, so it supported money shops, such as the addition of compradors, the provision of credit loans to foreign banks, and even the remittance system unique to money shops only dealt with foreign banks and resolved payments, while the emerging Chinese banks were still excluded. This was the golden age of the money shop industry, but good times don't last forever, and consecutive blows from the credit crisis, the abolition of taels and the adoption of yuan, and the financial contraction after the 23rd year of the Republic of China, coupled with its own corruption, whether in management or operation, were not as advanced as banks. The leading position of the old seniors gradually had to be replaced by the formidable younger generation. After the outbreak of the 813 War, Shanghai became an isolated island, and the abnormal speculative boom gave it a strong shot in the arm, because during the war, the losses of money shops were not as great as those of banks, and its rampant lending and high interest rates were beyond the reach of banks, so in the last three years, it has flourished again and the profits have doubled until recently, because the authorities controlled prices and cracked down on speculation, and the business of money shops seems to have returned from splendor to blandness, but the newly opened and prepared ones are still coming and going, is it really to help industry and commerce and revive the market or to continue the old tune and collude with speculative merchants? Let's wait and see what happens next.</p>
<h3>Sailing in the Same Stormy Boat</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(9) Human Hell</p>
<p>Wei Yunqing put down the abacus, rushed over and grabbed Madam Wei by the collar, "So, you old woman, you're interfering with my affairs! So you knew Miss Bian was there!" Wei Yunqing grabbed her collar for a while, probing and wanting his wife to tell him. Madam Wei usually couldn't stand up to Wei Yunqing in the Wei residence, but she was considered to be just below one person. Now that she was in front of her son and daughter-in-law and in front of the family, she stood firm and said, "You want to hit me? You want to hit me? I knew, how come you didn't ask me? If you didn't ask me, why should I tell you?" Wei Yunqing immediately let go and said, "You know, that's good. You say where is she?" Madam Wei said, "Good, so you know, Miss Bian and Shaoyun are together. This isn't Miss Bian being missing, nor Miss Bian being robbed, but an idea that Shaoyun came up with. He took her away so that you, the master, would give up on this idea."</p>
<p>Wei Yunqing heard his wife's words, gathered all the saliva in his mouth, puffed up both sides of his ribs, and then suddenly spat on Madam Wei's face, "Bah! Bah! Bah! You're dreaming, and you haven't woken up yet! You've been here for decades, don't you know my temper yet? If I want to do something, I'll stop when I've done it. If I can't do it, I won't stop! I don't have that kind of heart. How did I earn so much real estate? How did I earn so much farmland? Where did I get the money to feed so many mouths and have people wait on you? Old woman, listen up, taking a concubine is something that old people like us do. What concubine should young people take? I've worked hard for decades, and if I take a concubine, it's not even considered enjoyment. I want to take ten! What can you do?" Wei Yunqing's temper flared at Madam Wei. Madam Wei, in her capacity as a madam, dared to retort a few words, saying, "If you have the ability, go and take them. I can't control it. We'll all go out to watch Master Wei take a concubine. We'll open our mouths and eat wedding sweets!" Madam Wei wanted to walk out, but Wei Yunqing reached out and grabbed her, saying, "Where are you going? Your words clearly reveal that Miss Bian is somewhere. Where is that rebellious son Shaoyun? Tell me! Tell me now! If you don't tell me, I won't let you off. I'll go find them myself!" Madam Wei said, "I don't know." (182)</p>
