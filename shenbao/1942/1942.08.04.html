<p>第二種農夫是屬佃農制。其中有一部份是終身的長工，條件較寬，除略付田租外，自已還有不少剩餘，故生活蛟安定。還有一種是短期的長工，專門給人家種，自己所分得的五六成收穫，只夠日常的生活費用；所多剩的棉花，除了給自己做衣裳外，平時爲了許多節日，以及田主們的喜慶關係，往往連送禮還嫌短少。所以一個佃農往往在人家工作了四五年，還落得一身債務。</p>
<p>一般小地主也苦得很，照法人M.　Legrain估計，每個小地主所有的一切財產只合四十八個法郎。他們只有半公畝田，一所陋屋，一堂家具，田園裹有一頭牝牛，一頭牡牛或牡騾，幾只鶏鴿之類，一付農具，和一把老式犁。</p>
<p>至於大地主儘是貴族，他們在農民身上搜括的田租大得驚人。一畝田的買價只有一百七十五法郎，而所收的田租每年要五六百法郎，這眞是咄咄怪事。</p>
<p>田租貴一則固爲人口激增，農工日夥；埃及的手工工價賤，一般別處用機器做的工作，此地仍由人工做，也是這緣故。其次是可耕田太少。對於這問題，近年已有不少改善，他們往往開發荒地，使沙源變成財源。</p>
<p>埃及農人在田主搜括之下，加之年來抵押借款銀行的重利剝削，弄得苦不勝苦。他們的經濟狀况，當推爲全球第一首貧。至於農民們的教育和健康，亦因之而極落後，</p>
<p>他們大都住在甘蔗根搭成的小屋中，一間屋子往往擠得滿坑滿谷，加之又沒有窗戶，空氣弄得混濁十分，平時營養又不足，工作又過勞，所以死亡率甚大。幸而生產率更大，所以能使人口日增。但是兒童死亡率很足驚人，成人因多吃苞米而生腸胃病的很多，又因熱浪之故，生瘟疫的亦夥。此外因風沙之故，生砂眼的人竟達百分之九十二，寧非世界第一。生急性眼炎的和瞎子埃及也很多，因此在埃及到處有眼科醫院，一九三七年的世界眼科大會，亦是在埃及的開維舉行的。</p>
<p>經濟雜譚</p>
<p>埃及在Mehemet　Ali當政以前，一切的土地盡屬諸皇上，一般貴族巨顯也有若干私產，至於多數的農民却都是爲人作稼。到了一八六一年後，埃及方有民有田產一字。但近年外人的勢力漫延，所受的經濟侵略日益加深，所有的土地中，百分之三十四以上己被轉入異邦之手。一般農民都是酷愛田地的人，那麼爲什磨竟肯將自己的田產賣給外人呢？說來倒也有趣，原來埃及人大都信奉回教。照回教的教規，信徒借貸給別人，却不可以收利息的，因此富的農民便不會借錢別人了，而一般窮的農民只好向外人設立的土地抵押借款銀行中去出重利借貸，結果到期不能歸還，土地便落入人家掌中。假使教規同時也不准信徒向人家出利息借款的話，埃及的土地至今或者還是完全屬諸埃及人呢。</p>
<p>對於這種土地問題，埃及人亦何嘗不想法子補救，像在第一次歐戰時有人發起農民合作銀行和外人的銀行競爭，但成續還很少。</p>
<p>埃及的幣制，在十八世紀以前都用金幣和銀幣，可是現在所見到的，只有英國的金磅，法國的法郎，土耳其的土幣，你假使要看看這種埃幣，那非到博物院裹去不可。</p>
<p>一八九八年，埃及政府設立了一所國家銀行，同時發行了第一張埃及鈔票。但是因爲鈔票的價値每與本國棉花生產的多寡而漲落，又加政府方面也不强制流通，結果這種鈔票除了在幾個大都市中通行外，在鄉間根本是見不到了。至於在一八八五年發行的鎳幣，至今仍在市上流通。</p>
<p>假使一個國家的財政穩固與否是以其國債之多少爲準則的話，埃及便該是個財政不行的國家。它歲入約計二百萬埃及金幣，而每年所應付償的債務却佔了一半。埃及經濟方面的貧弱，正是共被異邦侵佔之一因也。</p>
<p>在美國有許多棉花大王，在埃及棉花本身便是大王，它不但是埃及的大王，還是世界上一切棉花中的大王。埃及的一切經濟活動都茲於此，歐非二洲的衣着原料也都仰仗於此。</p>

<p>— 宗一</p>
<p>今年比往年早，在五月間已經結束了學程，在這月中忙法統考，忙着一天到晚將論文打字打出來，還要忙着照畢業照相，方帽一戴，頭一抬簡直比博士還要神氣，此外還有忙着歡送會，茶話會，今天學生請教授，明天教授請學生，後天學生請學生忙得不可開交，總算事情都忙完了，一張臨時畢業證書也到手了。可是「畢業就是失業」立刻呈現到我們的頭上，畢了業自然第一件要緊的就是去我職業，現在一個月逝水似的過去，同學們也星散了，各奔前程去了，還好化學系一茶十幾位理學士都沒有奔出上海現在不妨將幾位大學生最近的遭遇告訴你們：</p>
<p>像老劉，他年紀在一系是最長，所以冠之以「老」字。老劉的家境很不壞，雖然他父親死了，但是他却得着一筆不小的遺產。總算他沒有白念化學系，現在開了一爿××西藥行，專門買賣什麼烏利龍，大健凰，還有什麼奧拍太純，百浪多息，賜保命……等，念都不好念的西藥，總算他生財有道，聽說他在雙桃奎寗上就賺了七萬多，怪不得他最近幾天還請了我們幾位老同學到DD，S吃茶呢！</p>
<p>郭老夫子，因爲他平常續書比較穩重，爲人也很原這，所以有老夫子之稱。現在郭老夫子脫離本行幹起交易所的生意來了，一天到晚總是雙馬，仙桃，童子軍廠單，什麽龍頭，飛魚，四君子棧單，外兼營軍票，股票行市，所以忙得連人影子都看不見，到他家裹去找老夫子，五六次都回說「少爺上公司去了」到底什磨公司我也不知道。</p>
<p>現在有錢的幹大買賣，錢少的幹小買賣，大人做買賣，甚至於小孩也做買賣，上海成了「買賣世界」了。像小王有着嶄新的思想，腦筋一動，想到夏天到了，現在騎自行車的這麼多，草帽生意大可一做。於是拿起他自己的老爺脚踏車，東跑跑西兜兜，大草帽，小草帽，上至外國人戴的最漂亮草帽，下至最普遍化的寗波鹽草帽都堆滿一座小亭子間，自己釘絲帶，自己上五彩顏色，自己送貨，自己做經理，賺錢也是自己用，一天努力之下除了三頓飯吃得很飽之外，還可以有零錢吃點心，看塲電影，現在居然也有新領　，新襯衫，新皮鞋了。</p>
<p>有抱積極主義的也有抱消極主義的。像我們鄭博士他野心最大，他將來價備有四個硫酸廠，二個燒鹼廠，一個大煤氣廠，五個化學原料公司。平素以學問淵博，故常以博士自居，你要問他現在硫酸廠燒鹼廠爲什麼不造起來，他的答案是『現在沒有「外國的原料，現在沒有」外國的機器，叫我怎樣問廠！』也許他學問太博了，所以一定要外國貨補充才行，他到沒有想想外國的機器和原料都是人造出來的。現在博士化學一曲絕彈了，竟唱起戀愛經來，可惜博士對於學問很好，對於戀愛一道並無深刻研究，現在竟遭到失戀，對方以、「愛悄不專回絕，博士也只好從此斷絕瓜葛，終於消極起來，上午睡懶覺，下午在大華冷氣舞廳，擺下一座小小的測字攤，淸茶一杯消磨終日。</p>
<p>化學系還有幾位女將們，也是巾幗鬚眉，說也奇怪，幾位女將在功課上總是比男生要好一些，像我們這位柳小姐，記憶絕頂，功課第一，在她的分數單幾平都是一等，她們住在愚園路，離「惠爾康，依文泰」都很近，這種日子眞有不少的回味呀！</p>
<p>啊我倒忘了一位重要大人物了—阿張—他會歷任多次化學會的會長，在同學方面得人心，在敎授方面也頗得寵？所以同學都跟他很親熱，很熟悉的叫他阿張，現在「風轉扭帆了前幾天跑馬廳大香賓總見他掛着紅牌出進忙碌，一會兒四號獨嬴，一會兒三四雙擋，一會兒來個搖彩，也夠他忙一天的，現跑馬歇夏了，他改到跑狗傷和回力球塲去了，整個下午都浸在亞兩培地，古巴龍，阿斯蒂歐蘭加……等人名裹和什磨買司託別而，克拉夫斗佛琴麗雅，伍特司刀克愛文……的狗名裹。</p>
<p>大學畢業了是多麽動人的名詞呀！大學生是社會的中堅。同時一個化學系裹的人，可是有淸不同的神聖事業，」至於對社會如何，我不敢批評，更不敢下斷語。僅希望他們和她們記着社會很需要人材，更需要大學的人材。同時希望他們要看得起自己，並且尊重百己。</p>

<p>王韜尺牘七　，共十八頁，已裝裱成帖，以儲鈔卅圓得之卡德路舊書店。淘沙得金（語出二十二日談舊書店篇），愉快可知，不可無記。</p>
<p>王，淸長洲人，字紫銓，號子九，父號仲弢，別署天南遯叟。能詩，工駢文。咸同時，官粵中，與洪楊通，洪楊旣定金陵，開科取士，王應試得狀元及第，時人爲之側目。洪楊　敗，主走香港，創辦循環日報，尋遊歐美，親見普法戰况，作普法覜戰記，復遊日本，作扶桑遊記。光緒間歸滬，主講格致書院，著有弢園文集，瀛儒雜誌，淞隱漫錄，甕牖餘談。</p>
<p>這七通信約三千餘言，內中有詩八章，紙墨極講究，寫的一手集王聖教序，是給他友人吳廣需的。吳的生平不詳，僅可從信裹知道他名灝，嘗從黃公度川使日本，任職參贊之款類和王韜關係極深，或竟是拜把子弟兄，因有幾通信裹，王自稱如弟，稱吳爲哥。</p>
<p>一般人目主韜爲淸末怪物，大抵爲了他是長毛狀元出身的緣故。昔年簡又文（即大華、烈士）謝與堯在滬，二位俱是研究洪楊史料的專家。記者偶然與之談起此人，一致認爲王只是書生本色，狂狷有之，自以爲一肚子經綸，切合時弊，沒有人睬他，不免流於憤激，與蘇東坡王安石等輩，胥屬一邱之貉。當時記者自愧淺學。唯唯而已。今細閱王氏尺牘，知道二位批判人物，實具卓見</p>
<p>王氏好駡人，短短七通信裹，筆鋒所觸及的，有黃公度，馬相伯，馬眉叔，李鴻章。這些俱是負一代時譽的人物，在他眼裹都有缺點。被駡得最厲害的是李鴻章云：「滿身俗骨，一派官臉，淺躁輕浮，胸無點墨」。批評黃公度云：「公度自履金山任，政聲倘佳，弟愛其才而竊鄙其人，良以其方寸阻深，有鱗甲笑貓之風，非吾輩光明磊落者可語。倘一朝得權改操，亦　謂，王欽若之流耳！吁，可畏哉！」平心而論，李黃自然不足稱完人，不過如他所說，似亦太過，此等處可以想見王氏狂態之一斑</p>
<p>好駡人的大抵自負不凡，他不僅自負，而且極熱中，有時竟認爲隻手可以旋轉乾坤。光緒壬午（一八八二），法國出兵越南，與我啟釁，淸廷以積弱之勢，意存退讓，命馬眉叔當折衛之任。他於致吳信中，表示不信任馬能勝仟此項交涉。「今茲越南之事，和戰尚無端頴，然以鄙人度之，法人未必敢遂絕我好，亦未必肯遽捨其地，大約仍歸結於法還越所下之城，越賠法興師之費，而以理論則彼曲我直，以勢言則彼遠我近，以眉叔之才，當斯重任，能否化其戎爲玉帛，弭禍患於無形，弟竊疑之……。」語氣率直，頗有「讓我來幹」之意味。光緒十九年，那時以王氏熱中情緒，大概已到白熱化的程度，自稱：「學兵十年，功名未立，滿腔熱血，擬乘此一吐。末段：「當道果憐才如兄言，尚有不盡之言，塡胸之憤，爲詳陳之。」一股請纓自效之熱忱活耀紙上。</p>
<p>於此記者感想甚多，語有之：秀才造反，三年不成，實在是至理名言。蓋秀才智識，大抵得自書本，於實地體騐殊少，即使說來頭頭是道，要亦紙上談兵，淸朝自中葉以後，歷經變故，結果朝野形成水火，當道的顢頇，在野的褊激，顢頇的人固然要不得，褊激之士，亦何嘗於事有濟。</p>
<p>書生不合時宜，窮困原是必然的遭遇，王氏窮困並且窮得可以。有一通信說是缺乏醫藥之資，向吳告貸四十番，四十番之微，竟不能隨地設法，必欲向萬里外呼籲（時吳任職日本），不能不視爲可憐的行徑。百無一用是書生，今古　慨。（民國三十一年七月潘鑄辛記）</p>

<p>— 一靑</p>
<p>展開今日的生活一頁，不要說在你五六年前不會想像到，就是去年今天，大家已經負看難以應付的担子掙扎在生活綫上的時候，也意料不到生活指數竟高漲到今日一天的，萬一想像得到的話，也要感到一焉能活着的吧？</p>
<p>如今，生活指數高漲由事實的給每一個人體騐，每一個人也還活着，這中間，除了極少數利用機會者反能過着較五六年前更奢侈的生活外，不難意會成千成萬人在高壓下喘不過氣來。</p>
<p>從回憶裏歎一句想「當初」，不過自尋煩惱罷了，憧憬「夢一般」的將來更無聊，要求活着，生活的方式就該有加以檢討的必要。</p>
<p>這一句話的意思，淺明的解說，就是你現在的牛活，如果覺得困雞（事實上一定困難的）的話，你先得問一問自己，你願意忍受這種困難嗎？否則，就該想法子了。</p>
<p>我們往往聽到這樣的說。生活太難了，應該「節流」一點才好。</p>
<p>常然，經濟上加以「節流」，這也可能設是使生活不困難的一個—法。不過，澈底的分析，太消極了，試問在今日生活高壓中，大部份都已經分過着最低最艱苦的生活，實在已經無「流」可「節」：即使能「節流」了，可節幾何？況月生活指數隨時在高漲，使你要「節」也無從節的。</p>
<p>因此，節流並不是積極解除生活困難的好方法，我的意見是：——</p>
<p>與其「節流」，不如「開源」！</p>
<p>當你讀到這裹，你一定立刻要反問：既然無「流」可「節」，難道有「源」可「開」嗎？</p>
<p>不錯，按浮面情形，雖然無「流」可「節」，至少可以「節」一些兒，「開源」倒不是隨地有「源」可「開」的，這一點，我懂得，我所以要這樣說，無論如何，「開源」才是一個積極的方法，足以解除生活困難。</p>
<p>姑且舉一個例子：你們是夫妻兩個人，當你覺得你一月薪金的收入已應付不了一個小家庭的生活，你就設法遺使你妻子返到家鄉去，這是屬於「節流」一條路，也就是消極的，但你要知道你妻子返鄉後還是一樣要生活的，同時你自己的生活未必見得可以安定了。如果「開源」，就應該這樣了，你的妻子也同你一樣的獻身社會謀工作，（無能力無知識的妻子在我們一羣也許沒有了）這不但可以使你們生活環境好轉，你的妻子也因此而增強社會經騐。</p>
<p>這不過例子罷了，總言之，「開源」的主要目的在加強工作力，範圍較「節流」廣泛，不論直接與間接間，它是積極的，除個人方面外，並且幫助着社會的建設與生產力。</p>

<h3 id="c54">一個小姑娘 <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— 陸薏</p>
<p>朋友！你是不是說，那窗口支願呆想的小姑娘，似乎有什麼心事嗎？不錯！她是有着心事。—幾小時以後，她將被逼着去做她不願意做的事：也就是所謂墮風塵，入火坑。你月不要驚奇，請坐下來，讓我給你個詳細的敘述。你屢次問起她，今天我該給你滿意的答覆。</p>
<p>你不是懷疑着那個她　為「姆媽」的並不是她的生母嗎？不錯。她本來是鄉下人，因着逃難來上海，四年前彼她的生母以一百五十元的代價，和六年的期限，押賣給一個妓女　養女。不久，這妓女　　洋行買辦量珠聘去，便借我們這樓上為藏嬌的金屋。那便是每星期六坐着包車來的陳先生，和她現在的姆媽，她就以養女的身份寄住於此。</p>
<p>你父問　她老家的情形嗎？她老家本來開糖菓舖，　後也漸漸　恢　從前的境況。她有個哥哥，時常寫信給她，希望她　回去。可是她的押賣期遝差二年，未滿年的贖價，須連　往的食宿衣着損失在內，恐怕一個小小的糖莫舖還不夠吧！喔，你說就這樣吃吃玩玩生活倒比鄉下為舒適嗎？她倒不這麼想，在她那種年齡已應該有家族　念，而況她曾念過書，她在書本裹能知道，她現在的地位是不會受人尊敬的。</p>
<p>忍耐兩年？你不是說她只要忍耐到她做滿養女的年限嗎，呵，事實並不這樣簡單！她的「姆媽」，是個存心狠毒的老妓，一個過時的洋行買辦，對於「小房子」的供應，巳不夠她的　霍。於是總算她不忘其本，預備重理舊事，為顧慮買辦的干涉，她就把這小姑娘做資本去加股與人合作，在「生意浪」，她是從「經理」而退居「董事」地位。對啊！那就是要這小姑娘去做妓女。明天，就是明天要去！</p>
<p>救她？你怪我為甚坐視不救？唉，雖然那姑娘也曾有着求助於我的表示，但沒有充實的經濟力量，教我怎樣來盡我應盡的義務呢？</p>
<p>她曾經問我會不會譏笑她，卑視她。你知道我怎樣回答她？我說：我只有議笑自己，卑視自己，因為我是一個人，竟不能挽救另外一個人。你說對嗎？</p>
<p>怎麼？你說這也是社會問題。朋友，任何不滿意的現實，你總把牠稱為一個廣大名稱的問題，以為便可逃遁自己的　仟。我却不能贊同。宇宙間的事物，對於人類發生了作用，便是人類本身的責任，尤其是入類　體的社會。我們不能挽救她，但我們不能放下我們做人的責仟的，你以為如何？　（酬移助學金）</p>

<p>— 桀人</p>
<p>我們要明白眞即，指導社會的改進，創建大業等，必先獲得眞實的學問和知識；要獲得眞實的學問和知識，只有向書本中探求。人類的學問是每天　步不止的，你不努力跟着跑，便落伍退後，這個不消說；尤要養成讀書的習慣，在學問中尋求興趣。</p>
<p>世界上值得閱讀的書本，眞浩如瀚　。莊子說：「吾生也有涯，而知也無涯，以有涯隨無涯，殆矣！」如不加選擇，不論在經濟時間和精神方面都不可能的。</p>
<p>我們應該讀些什麼書呢？</p>
<p>在人生修養方面：該多讀世界各國偉人的傳記，可以從過去偉人生活中，認識人生奮鬥努力的正當途徑，間接會改造你的生活和事業的成就。</p>
<p>在業務方面：必須多讀和自己業務相關的書籍，多多獲得業務上的知識，這對於職業靑年尤關重要。在學校中所求得的知識，多半屬於普通的，所以剛進人社會，便感覺到自己學識的缺少，而不切實用。從事職業的人，圖上進，求成功，必然利用業餘的時問，來作研究探求的工作，以增進業務上的學識和辦事能力。</p>
<p>至於休閒教育力面，須多讀欣賞的書本，以增進精神上的愉快，使切實了解人生的意義，並可指導人們向更幸福的途徑進展。</p>
<p>胡適之先生說：「我們應多讀書，無論什麼書都讀。往往一本極平常的書中，埋伏着一個很大的暗示。」　現在人們的生活，大家都非常忙碌，沒有充分的讀書時間，尤其業餘的讀者們，光陰對於他們是無上的寳貴，故一定，要費最少的時間，讀最有用的書；用最少的精力，獲得最大的效果。</p>

<h3 id="c58">家的苦難 <a href="#c58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— 之音</p>
<p>妻一向憧憬着的上海，到去年十一月間，才算給達到了目的，但那是經歷了好幾次艱難與危險的旅程，才到得上海的。</p>
<p>當時在她的惟悴的臉上，果然透出了得意的微笑，苦痛的情緒却刺激了我。要住在上海生活，我預算過在經濟負担上，只少要比住在鄉間時加上一倍。譬如鄉間我們有着自己的住屋，在自己的山上也可以斫些柴做燃料，小菜之類經常也可以從自己的菜田上割來的，……但現在呢，屋子，煤球，小菜，以至自來水，倒尿桶……一切的一切，都得付出代價去的了。</p>
<p>担起沉重的肩負，從萬分困難中先找得了一個一層擱，再添買了些家具器皿，一個家是勉強地建立了。滿擬從此能相依為命，共甘共苦地住下去的，意料不到的，是這以後的生活，並不如妻所意想中的安定，誠然，道裹有着她所憧憬着的繁華，但可憐除了看看電車汽車的衝駛，一些高樓大廈的　立天際，聆聆無綫雷中的不熟悉的爵士音樂……之外，她更能體會得一些什麼呢？垃圾桶邊的棄嬰，露天馬路的死屍，……這些可說是她到上海來後才見識到的惰景，她曾這樣地告訴過我。</p>
<p>更可說，隨着食米煤球以及其他日常用品是漸漸地難可獲得了，事實上即使能困難地獲得，但在經濟程度上的漲率，實在巳超過我所能負担的了，我乃不得不重新考慮在上海生活下去的可能性了。而經考慮的結果，我認為只有叫妻仍舊返鄉去。</p>
<p>妻很能體會我們當前的境遇，雖然在情感上是萬分不願地，但她終於也痛苦地答應了下來。</p>
<p>三個月前，我於是又送憂鬱了臉的妻到返鄉的輪埠上。</p>
<p>來去匆匆，我深深為道生活的捉弄，引起了無涯的苦悶，但想起了生活的担子，從此應該減輕了，內心就不覺鬆上口氣來。</p>
<p>但三個月來，從妻的陸續寄來的家書上，仍給我帶來了沉重的苦悶，牠近乎怨尤地告訴我：</p>
<p>「……你的想頭可錯了！回到鄉裹來，屋子確是不用再付房和了，但這兒那兒的捐稅，正可抵得上海一個三層擱的租金呢。是的，燃料本不用買，但山上的一些柴木，都給人家偷斫去了，家中因此仍需要出錢買柴燃，價錢與煤球相差無幾，只是在「買」上，不用如在上海般的　擠軋了。呵，告訴你，這兒的米價也漲得快熱脊，現在也要五百元錢一石了，油·鹽·布·……那一件不是在日漲夜大中呢。總之，我現在住在鄉間，在消費上正相抵於去年上海住時的程度，一錢也少不來的，因此我仍想把家搬回到上海，…「仍想回到上海來！」我可眞怕家的重臨上海了。幾月來的故鄉的變動，固出於我的意料之外，但妻可更不知道上海更不是三個月前的上海了！</p>
<p>我告訴妻：「讓我們再受一下苦難吧！今日的上海，恐和你所接觸過的上海，又完全二個樣子！無論是那一項，這裏的生活費用，顯然父和三個月前的，漲上二三倍哩！因此，我請求妳，不要再存出來的念頭吧，……」</p>
<p>想念着苦難的家，在沉重生活梗策之下，我不覺茫然了</p>

<p>物價高漲，生活艱雖，虎列　盛行……生命脆弱得像一張簿紙。</p>
<p>連靑年們也都搖頭嘆氣，有的嚷着「悶」，有的縱情聲色。</p>
<p>嚷悶和縱情聲色的都在浪費生命。</p>
<p>生命果然脆弱，然而應該浪費麼？</p>
<p>我記起一本小說裹主人公的話：</p>
<p>「人最寶貴的是生命，生命於我們只有一次而巳。一個人的生命是應當這樣波過的：當他回首往事時，他不因虛度年華而悔恨，也不因過去的碌碌無為而羞恥。」</p>

<p>East Zhejiang Japanese Troops, Third Allied News Agency Report: On July 30th, Japanese troops reached Beijie Town and Xinlu, 40 kilometers south of Longyou. The next day at dusk, they advanced to the north of a mountain 682 meters high, which is 20 kilometers south of Beijie Town. They are now rapidly advancing towards Songyang (85 kilometers southeast of Jinhua), on the southwest front line of Zhejiang Province. Xinlu Bay fell on the evening of the 30th, and Beijie Town fell at 3 p.m. on the same day, which was the second day of the Japanese army's new offensive.</p>
<p>Guangdong, Third Allied News Agency Report: According to Chongqing reports, Japanese planes carried out large-scale air raids in the three provinces of Fujian, Hunan, and Jiangxi. On July 31st and August 1st, there were two attacks on Changmen on the north bank of the Min River, destroying military facilities within the city. Another team of Japanese planes attacked Longquan, located in the southeast of Zhejiang Province near the border of Fujian. Furthermore, Japanese planes carried out an air raid on Lingling in southern Hunan last night, destroying military equipment.</p>
<p>East Zhejiang Japanese Troops Front Line, Third Allied News Agency Report: After crossing the Xianxia Ridge and Fengling Mountain ranges, the elite Japanese troops, braving the heat, occupied Beijie, 40 kilometers south of Longyou, and Xinlu Bay, 8 kilometers south of the town, at 3 p.m. on the 30th of last month.

<h3 id="e2">Gandhi and Nehru Declare: Determined to Fight to the End <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Muslim League Criticizes the Congress Party</p>
<p>Lisbon, Third Allied News Agency Report: According to news from New Delhi, Gandhi and Nehru were very displeased upon hearing the threatening remarks made by Amery, the British Secretary of State for India, and Cripps, the Minister in charge of Indian affairs, regarding the Indian issue. Gandhi recently published an article in Harijan, replying by saying that the All-India National Congress Party will disregard both open and hidden threats, and will not change the policy it has decided upon as a result. The civil disobedience movement will be launched as scheduled. The only way to salvage the situation is to grant India immediate independence. During the war, Allied troops can be stationed in India, but they have no right to interfere in India's internal affairs. India should be as free as Britain. Nehru made a speech in Allahabad, using even more intense language. He said, "Struggle, struggle to the end, this is my reply to Amery and Cripps. India's self-respect leaves no room for bargaining. I deeply know that Britain is currently in a difficult situation. Over the years, I have requested a reasonable solution so that all countries can follow suit and move forward as free nations. Thinking about it now, I am filled with sorrow and indignation."</p>
<p>Allahabad, Second Havas News Agency Report: The leader of the Indian National Congress Party, Nehru, recently made a speech here, stating that we will fight to the end, this is my reply to Amery and Cripps. The aspirations of the Indian people leave no room for bargaining. Recalling my personal constant struggle over the past year, I originally wanted to establish an agreement with Britain so that India could become a free country, following Britain's lead and moving forward together. But now, what is the result? Thinking about this, I am filled with sorrow and indignation. Furthermore, former Congress Party Chairman Prasad also made a speech in Patna, stating that Gandhi's proposed civil disobedience movement based on non-violent principles is the final and decisive struggle for India's freedom. Britain still refuses our independence, claiming that India is not yet unified, making it difficult to transfer power to the Indians. Gandhi has a different view on this, as he believes that India must be independent before it can be unified. This is the result of our leader's many years of experience, and it is also the conclusion of the recent talks with Cripps.</p>
<p>Bangkok, Third Haitong News Agency Report: The President of the All-India Muslim League, Jinnah, made a speech in Bombay on Friday, severely criticizing the policies of the All-India National Congress Party, but at the same time, he strongly stated that there is indeed a possibility of cooperation between these two major Indian parties. Not only that, but the Muslim League is willing to establish an agreement with the Congress Party under certain conditions. Those concerned are very interested in Jinnah's speech, believing that the Muslim League fears that the Congress Party will greatly expand its power due to the implementation of the disobedience movement, which will ultimately be detrimental to the Muslim League. Therefore, Jinnah made this speech. Another explanation is that Britain is using its financial power to force the Muslim League to confront the Congress Party, in order to destroy or at least delay the Congress Party's plan by using Indians to control Indians.</p>
<p>Mahatma Gandhi Arrives in Bombay Yesterday</p>
<p>Bombay, Third Havas News Agency Report: Mahatma Gandhi arrived here today, and the crowd welcoming him at the station was huge and bustling. Gandhi is scheduled to attend the All-India Congress Party Executive Committee meeting on the 6th of this month. The main topic of discussion at the meeting will be the "British Quit India" resolution passed by the Standing Committee. Today is Gandhi's "Day of Silence," so there was no action of any kind.</p>
<p>Bangkok, Second Allied News Agency Report: According to news from London, Amery, the Secretary of State for India, recently instructed the Governor-General of India, Linlithgow, to closely monitor Gandhi and Nehru, and decided to take full precautions at the National Congress Party Congress in Bombay on the 7th. If Gandhi and Nehru's words and actions are unstable, the meeting should be stopped immediately. The same instructions have also been issued regarding measures to deal with Muslims.</p>
<p>Bangkok, Third Haitong News Agency Report: It has been learned here that there are widespread rumors in various parts of India that riots and armed conflicts may occur when the National Congress Party Committee discusses Gandhi's independence movement resolution on August 7th. Many people in India believe that if Gandhi launches a civil disobedience movement, most of the shops in India may close down. In recent days, shops have been selling large quantities of food and other items to prevent such an eventuality. It has also been heard that many Congress Party leaders have left their hometowns and gone to Bombay to prepare to attend the Congress Party Committee meeting. Speaker Acharya has now left Calcutta, and Nehru will also leave Allahabad tomorrow.</p>
<p>Pro-British Faction Proposes a Solution</p>
<p>Bangkok, Second Allied News Agency Report: Sir Sapru, President of the Liberal Federation of India, who has always been pro-British, has proposed the following plan to resolve the Indian issue:</p>
<p>Britain should clearly state that it will grant the Indian people independence and freedom one year after the end of the war.</p>
<p>Britain should clarify the powers of the Governor-General and the Indians in administration.</p>
<p>Foreign affairs and finance should be managed by the Indians themselves.</p>
<p>The advisors in the state governments should be abolished.</p>
<p>The civil disobedience movement should be suspended.</p>
<p>Gandhi and leaders of various factions in India should convene an Indian Congress.</p>
<p>The above proposals are nothing more than speaking for Britain. Congress Party leader Nehru strongly rejected the proposal, saying that the Congress Party would never accept this proposal, because what we are asking for is only the immediate realization of independence and freedom for India. Furthermore, Sapru's faction has very few members and no value in existing, so it will not affect the direction of the Congress Party.</p>
<p>Non-Cooperation Movement Brewing</p>
<p>Lisbon, Second Allied News Agency Report: According to a dispatch from Wardha, the heads of the Indian National Congress Party met with Gandhi here on the 2nd to listen to the implementation plan of the new non-cooperation movement, and to discuss the specific direction of the non-cooperation movement, so that when Britain rejects the demands of the Congress Party, the whole country will launch the non-cooperation movement at the same time. The British authorities are deeply worried about this, and are using their usual tactics of both hard and soft measures to prevent the launch of the non-cooperation movement. For example, the Bengal branch of the Indian Landowner's League passed a resolution on the 2nd, stating that the non-cooperation movement would give the enemy an opportunity to suppress the Indian people and plunge India into misery. It is believed that this was instigated by Britain. According to a dispatch from New Delhi, the Indian government has received instructions from Amery, the Secretary of State for India, to take full preparations to deal with the launch of the non-cooperation movement, but the situation has been decided and Britain has no way to reverse it.</p>
<p>Lisbon, Second Allied News Agency Report: According to a Reuters dispatch from Patna, India, Dr. Prasad, the former chairman of the Indian National Congress, spoke on the urgent Indian issue on the 2nd, stating that the new All-India National Movement advocated by Gandhi - that is, the form of a non-violent movement - is actually the final battle for India to gain independence. In the past, the British government often used the excuse that India was not yet unified to refuse to return power to the Indians. Therefore, Gandhi's movement this time will achieve unification and realize independence. This is the result of Gandhi's experience over the years, and also the lesson learned from Cripps' visit to India recently.</p>

<p>Istanbul, Third Haitong News Agency Report: Former Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Aktay, lost consciousness in his residence yesterday. A pistol was left beside him. He was rushed to the hospital after being discovered, but died in the afternoon. He apparently shot himself due to a nervous breakdown. According to reports, the deceased was appointed as the Ambassador to the Soviet Union in 1939 and was recalled to his country this year to report on the attempted assassination of the German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen. He did not return to his post after the incident, and in the previous month, the government appointed Akat as the successor Ambassador to the Soviet Union.</p>

As far as is generally known, the ambassador was physically weak. He suffered greatly from the severe wartime life spent in Kubyshev last winter, which made his physical strength even worse, which may be one of the reasons for his sudden suicidal thoughts.</p>

<h3 id="e9">Vichy Authorities Promote Rice Planting <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Vichy, Second Havas News Agency Report: France's rice has always been imported from French Vietnam. This source has been blockaded and cut off. The French authorities are now planning to promote rice planting to remedy the situation. The French people's food consumption requires a total of 600,000 tons of rice per year. Since the armistice agreement was signed between France and Germany in June 1940, the British blockade policy has been extended to France. At that time, France only had 58,000 tons of rice in stock. The authorities then implemented restrictions on consumption, stipulating that each person could only purchase 10 ounces per month. On the one hand, they promoted rice planting, with the Rhone River Delta being the most suitable area. Many Annamese people have been hired to teach rice planting methods. Italy has the highest rice production in Europe, but its output is only one-tenth of that of Vietnam. Although France's rice planting plan does not hope to be self-sufficient or catch up with Italy, it is hoped that it can meet the urgent need.</p>

It is reported that the Soviet occupying forces are responsible for taking the necessary measures.

<p>Istanbul, Second Havas News Agency Report: After the cabinet crisis in Iran, most newspapers here severely criticized the various measures adopted by the British authorities. Prominent journalist Nayat published an article in the "Kanghal Leaf" newspaper stating that "The current crisis cannot be dismissed as merely a domestic affair. Independent nations of the British Commonwealth, proud of their freedom and independence, must not only occupy other countries, but should also reflect on themselves in all aspects. The various measures adopted by Britain in Iran have exceeded the scope of military needs. This is a shameful disgrace in British history. Iran has fallen into a perpetual crisis. The resignation of the cabinet is just a sign of the overall chaos. To save the overall situation, the only way is to reduce the area of foreign military occupation and let the Iranian people handle Iranian internal affairs."</p>

<p>London, First Havas News Agency Report: "The World Review" magazine recently published an article by editor Carmichael discussing the issue of holding closed parliament sessions, stating that "The reason why the British Parliament must hold closed sessions is not entirely because it does not want to provide the enemy with information, but actually because of the emotional impulses of the Allied countries themselves. Washington does not seem to realize that discussions of thorny issues should actually be relegated to closed sessions." "The Economist" magazine also wrote an article in support, stating that the war information coming from the UK and the US sometimes differs greatly. If the two Allied governments can maintain closer contact, parliamentary debates will be more convenient.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Battles on the Sal River and Don River Areas: German and Soviet Forces Engage in Bloody Combat; Red Army Resistance Strengthened, Situation Returns to a Stalemate <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>German Supreme Headquarters, 3rd (Havas Agency Telegram) – Today's German military communiqué stated that our tank divisions pursued enemy forces to the upper reaches of the Kupen River, where the resisting Soviet forces were routed, capturing countless military supplies and numerous artillery pieces. In the Jie-jia area, enemy rear-guard units were forced to retreat southward, with German forces continuing to advance. Between the Salko and Don Rivers, German and Romanian forces persistently forced the enemy to retreat eastward. German aircraft provided significant support to ground operations, striking Soviet transportation lines in the Kupen area with particular intensity. The railway connecting Baku and Rostov was heavily bombed. Soviet counterattacks along the Don River were repelled, with 85 enemy tanks destroyed. Our dive bombers and anti-tank gun teams played a crucial role. Our aircraft conducted night raids on ships on the Volga River, sinking two oil tankers and six freighters, while damaging nine other freighters. North of Rzhev, before Leningrad, intense enemy units continued to attack our forces on the Vulgok-Wei front, hoping to alleviate the pressure felt by Soviet forces on the southern route. In the Lapland region, German infantry and mountain troops repeatedly attacked several Soviet positions with swift movements. Yesterday, Soviet forces lost 114 aircraft, while five German aircraft went missing.</p>
<p>Bear City, 3rd (Allied News Agency Telegram) – German mechanized units continue to advance towards the Caucasus. The Red Army is now making strenuous efforts to prevent German forces from advancing east towards Stalingrad, an industrial city on the Volga River. To maintain its security, the Red Army is striving to prevent the German forces east of Salsk from quickly linking up with the German forces crossing the Don River. Bloody battles are now unfolding in the Sal River and Don River areas. German paratroopers are landing behind Soviet lines, disrupting the Red Army's front.</p>
<p>Moscow, 3rd (Havas Agency Telegram) – The Soviet Information Bureau announced this morning that Red Army forces engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy last night in the Kreskaya, Tsimlyanskaya, Kushchufskaya, and Salsk areas. German forces launched a major offensive in Kreskaya, sacrificing 2,000 soldiers. In the Kushchufskaya and Salsk areas, the Red Army conducted a difficult defensive battle. Cossack cavalry launched several attacks, routing 1,500 German soldiers in the Kupen and Don River areas.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 3rd (Havas Agency Telegram) – Over the past 24 hours, there has been little major change in the southern Soviet war situation. German motorized vanguard units are still advancing towards the Kupen River, appearing to have reached the vicinity of Kropotkin. German tanks in that area have a significant advantage. Although the Cossack forces are equipped with anti-tank guns, they lack sufficient mechanized units to support them, so they may still have to retreat. However, it can be predicted that German elite units will inevitably encounter a strong Soviet defense line one day, which they will be unable to break through, thus requiring encirclement tactics. At the current rate of German progress, German forces should reach the Kupen River within this week. This river is the only natural defense line east of the Kuma River and in northern Caucasus. It is expected that the main forces of both sides will come into contact within days. The outcome of this battle is of great importance to the success or failure of the German summer offensive. As for the Don River bend front, which is about 120 miles long, the resistance of the Soviet troops has been continuously strengthened, and the two armies have once again fallen into a stalemate. Regarding the battles around Voronezh, the Soviet military's center of resistance has now shifted to the mountainous area northwest of Kalach. In the past ten days, the Soviet side has lost 482 tanks, demonstrating that the Soviet military authorities have now decided to spare no sacrifice to defend key positions. However, the German summer offensive has already paid a great price and will inevitably persist to the end. Its destinations are initially Krasnodar and Meilutuo, then Stalingrad, and finally Astrakhan and Baku.</p>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Havas Agency Telegram) – German forces have reached the upper reaches of the Kupen River. This river is a major waterway between the Don River and the Caucasus Mountains, originating from Mount Elbrus (the highest peak in the Caucasus Mountains). It initially flows north, then turns west, passing through the Kupen plain. Its tributaries flow into the Azov Sea and the Black Sea. The Kupen River is 880 kilometers long. The primary city in the Kupen region is Krasnodar, with a population of 200,000. Before the outbreak of this war, the total population of the Kupen region was 3.1 million.</p>
<p>Fierce Battles in the Don River Basin, Strong Soviet Resistance</p>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Havas Agency Telegram) – According to a German High Command announcement, the battle situation in the Don River basin is intense, with strong Soviet resistance. German forces are increasing their troop strength and expect significant results. German and allied forces are pursuing Soviet forces, making considerable progress south of Kozovskaya and other areas. The Soviet rearguard units have been routed, and German forces have captured approximately 800 prisoners. Romanian forces are assisting in the southern advance and have achieved notable combat results. German aircraft are bombing retreating Soviet motorized units and attacking railways in the Kuban area. Several enemy aircraft were destroyed in their hangars. German and Italian joint forces are attacking Soviet bridgeheads in the Don River bend, forcing Soviet troops to retreat across the Don River. German forces repelled Soviet forces southwest of Kalach, destroying numerous tanks. Soviet bridgeheads were also bombed. Soviet attempts to cross the river in the northern Don area were repelled by Hungarian forces, suffering heavy losses. Soviet forces launched two offensives northwest of Voronezh, losing three tanks. German aircraft shot down 29 Soviet aircraft in the southern part of the Eastern Front yesterday.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to news from the Southern Front, the fiercest fighting on the Southern Front is in the areas of Bataysk and Kstovskoye, as well as the Caucasus line north of Loretsk and Salsk. The Soviet side also admits that the war situation is serious and states that the German army's fierce attack on the rear of the North Caucasus Soviet defense line has caused the situation to take a sharp turn for the worse. Another report says that the German troops who occupied Kstovskoye are pursuing the defeated Soviet troops to the south and continuing their attack. It is reported that the vanguard mechanized units of the German army on the Rostov-Baku railway have occupied many important places and are launching fierce attacks towards the Qi-Pao area. According to the report, this place is the intersection of the Rostov-Baku railway and the Stalingrad-Krasnodar railway, and the German army advancing along the Stalingrad-Krasnodar railway is echoing its friendly forces and pressing southwest. According to Vichy news, it is reported that the German vanguard has reached the Peyserkonevskaya area near Dazhou. The 70 kilometers of the railway leading to Peyserkonevskaya has been completely cut off by the German army.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Ukrainian Border, 2nd (Havas Agency Telegram) – According to the latest news from the front, German forces in the Kuban area south of Rostov are still continuing their advance. The Teharesk railway center was occupied by German forces under General Book on the night of the 1st of this month. According to unconfirmed reports, the vanguard of German mechanized units reached the banks of the Kuban River yesterday, 30 miles west of the Teharesk-Armavir railway line. The railway hub city of Kropotkin is also under threat from German forces. It is generally believed that the current goal of General Book's German forces is the city of Krasnodar. As for the German offensive along the coast of Azov, it has slowed down because the Soviet garrison on the Taman Peninsula is putting up strong resistance.</p>
<p>Soviet Newspaper Calls on Military and Civilians to Defend the Nation with All Their Might</p>
<p>Moscow, 3rd (Allied News Agency Telegram) – Moscow Radio has just broadcast an editorial from the newspaper Pravda, calling on Soviet soldiers and civilians to defend the nation. According to Pravda, "The situation in the south is serious and complex. The danger to the country is now intense. In order to defeat the enemy's plans and protect the resources of the south, we must break the enemy's pressure. We must fight to the last drop of blood everywhere. We must prevent the enemy from entering every mountain, river, and piece of land. Every inch of land handed over to the Red Army is sacred. We would rather die than retreat."</p>
<p>Moscow, 2nd (Havas Agency Telegram) – Pravda recently published an article emphasizing the seriousness of the Red Army's situation, urging railway workers to focus on transportation. It stated, "Transportation is the lifeline of national defense, and the fate of the country depends on it. Your position is no different from that of soldiers on the front lines. From the railway director to the flag wavers and track workers, all have a major mission to fulfill. They must demonstrate their spirit of organization, discipline, and perseverance. Winter is not far away, and all preparations for water pool facilities and fuel supply should be made early."</p>
<h3 id="e19">Eastern Front: German Troops <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Occupy 80% of the Total</p>
<p>Stockholm, 2nd (Havas Agency Telegram) – "The Stockholm Daily News" recently carried a London telegram stating that, according to reliable British sources, since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, the Soviet Union has suffered more than five million soldiers killed, wounded, and captured. The lost territory is approximately equal to the combined area of Italy, France, and Germany. The population in the occupied areas is also close to 50 million. Therefore, the population currently under Soviet rule has decreased to 140 million, while the population under German rule has reached 300 million. From an economic point of view, the Soviet Union has lost half of its steel production, now only able to produce 10 million tons of steel annually, while Germany can produce 40 million tons annually. Aluminum production has also been lost by 75%. The losses of coal mines and farmland are also considerable. Last year, the German forces concentrated in the Soviet Union accounted for about one-third of its total troop strength. This year, the German troops fighting on the Eastern Front account for about 80% of its total. Based on this analysis, opening a second front is a matter of utmost urgency. When the Soviet delegation visited London last month, they strongly advocated for the necessity of this action. It is rumored that General Marshall will be appointed as the commander-in-chief of the British and American forces on the second front. In reality, even if Marshall's appointment is announced immediately, it does not mean that the second front can be established within the year. British and American military experts generally believe that regarding the opening of the second front, only preparations can be made this year, and there will be no actual military action in Western Europe until 1943.</p>

<p>Head to the Mediterranean</p>
<p>Stockholm, 3rd (Havas Agency Telegram) – German Admiral Doenitz told a reporter from the Swedish Daily News yesterday that a large number of German submarines have gone to the Mediterranean to maintain the freedom of communication between Italy and North Africa. This move is not to evade the enemy, but to control the enemy's throat. In order to quickly and severely strike the enemy, we have conducted submarine warfare off the American coast. This matter is by no means easy, but the United States has devised a method to deploy a swift and non-negligible defense line. I do not wish to ignore the enemy's strength. As for the rumors that German submarines are using neutral territorial waters or floating islands as bases, they are ridiculous. In reality, our submarines are capable of crossing the Atlantic and approaching enemy coasts. All members of our submarine crews are naval volunteers. As for enemy bombing of our submarines, it has had no effect so far. At present, our submarines have very strong anti-aircraft equipment, and no bombing can damage them.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Intense Artillery Battles on the Egyptian Front <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Rome, 3rd (Allied News Agency Telegram) – According to an announcement by the Italian Supreme Command, air and artillery battles on the Egyptian front are very intense. Italian and German air forces are heavily bombing British tanks concentrated in the rear. During the attack on the Halfa airfield, two British fighter planes were shot down, and two other British planes were shot down by anti-aircraft fire.</p>
<p>Cairo, 3rd (Havas Agency Telegram) – The British Middle East Command announced this morning that British reconnaissance patrols were active on all routes of the Egyptian front last night. Yesterday, British field artillery attacked enemy positions on the southern route. British bombers and fighter planes attacked enemy reconnaissance teams in the Guataira Lowlands, achieving success. The enemy commander on the southern route also launched an attack.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Air Defense Exercises Held on the Western Coast of Norway; Germany Broadly Constructs Airfields in Occupied Areas; Britain and the United States Consider Establishing a Supreme Command <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, 2nd (Havas Agency Telegram) – In recent days, "large-scale defense exercises have been held on the western coast of Norway, especially in the area southeast of Trondheim Harbor and Klixingsand, with the theme of preventing enemy landings. During the exercises, all merchant ships and fishing boats were prohibited from sailing in the exercise area, as the German authorities had reportedly placed mines in several places. In addition, the Norwegian authorities have ordered all public institutions to handle the matter in the same way as civilians, quickly handing over all copper, tin, and lead items, such as door knockers and metal equipment used in offices, to the authorities. Most of these collected items will be transported to German munitions factories, and the rest will be retained by domestic factories for their own use.</p>
<p>Madrid, 3rd (Havas Agency Telegram) – According to reports in newspapers here, if Britain and the United States want to attack Europe and open a second front, there is no hope of victory from the beginning. Foreign journalists who inspected the fortresses along the Atlantic coast all believed that they were extremely strong and difficult to attack. A Dutch journalist said that he believed that the Siegfried Line had been moved to the Atlantic coast. Another journalist said that the Atlantic coast has become a fortified line of steel and concrete. German troops are waiting in full battle readiness, and the transportation network is dense and can transport troops to threatened locations at any time. German tank divisions are also stationed in strategically important locations, preparing to move to the landing points of enemy forces. Airfields have been built throughout the occupied areas, and planes and warships patrol near the coast day and night.</p>
<p>New York, 3rd (Havas Agency Telegram) – The New York Times said in an editorial today that the authorities in charge in London and Washington are seriously considering the establishment of a joint British-American supreme commander to command all the forces of the two countries. It is being discussed whether to organize a supreme command composed of the naval, land, and air force generals of the two countries, or to hold meetings in London to decide on general strategies. However, this move has not yet been agreed upon, and some senior officers in Britain and the United States have expressed objections. Therefore, no decision will be made on this matter for at least several weeks. However, the situation will be different if the Allied forces suffer another setback in the Middle East or if the Soviet army's resistance collapses. Washington has now publicly admitted that the British-American staff group has failed to fully utilize the strengths of both countries, especially in terms of adjusting and distributing military equipment production and utilizing certain special weapons in the United States. British and American military authorities now unanimously believe that establishing a supreme command and appointing a commander-in-chief for Europe are both wise steps. Candidates for the generals to organize this supreme command have now been proposed, indicating that this matter is already imminent.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Havas Agency Telegram) – New York Telegram, the Baltimore Sun yesterday presented several people as candidates for the Allied forces' supreme commander, in addition to General Marshall, the newspaper also proposed General MacArthur, General Tegor, and General Macknoden, commander-in-chief of the Canadian overseas expeditionary force.</p>
<p>Estimated Number of German Troops Stationed in France</p>
<p>Lisbon (Allied News Agency Telegram) – According to reports from London, the German army moved sixteen regiments, including two mechanized divisions, to the Soviet front line, leaving France almost undefended. Those who believe this statement are mocked by the British military authorities. It is understood that other divisions replaced all the divisions that left France, and the claim that nine divisions remained in the rear is not agreed with. It is estimated that Germany has at least twenty-five divisions stationed in France.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Havas Agency Telegram) – Renolzier, a famous American military reporter, wrote in the Ariel magazine on July 18 that attempting to invade Europe is like playing the lottery, and it is difficult to be sure of success. Because Germany can use all materials in France, Norway and other occupied areas, 300,000 well-equipped German troops waiting for work pose a major obstacle to the British and American invasion of Europe. Whether they can be removed is in doubt.</p>
<p>Rome, 3rd (Havas Agency Telegram) – The Roman People's Daily published an exclusive and unconfirmed report from Stockholm yesterday, claiming that Churchill flew to Moscow to meet Stalin, and the situation during the meeting was very tense. Stalin reportedly accused Churchill of abandoning the Soviet Union on the spot. The newspaper added that the Anglo-Soviet agreement has been established for two months, but the United Kingdom has not fulfilled its promises to the Soviet Union, but the United Kingdom itself is indeed unable to do so.</p>
<p>Delicate Relations Between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – The German army's rapid advance on the southern front has made the Soviet Union's demand for the formation of a second front even more urgent. According to a telegram from Moscow, since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, although the Soviet Union has been in a great crisis, it has been quite silent on the demands of Britain and the United States to land on the European continent. However, all Soviet newspapers on the 2nd unanimously published reports requesting that Britain immediately launch a second front in accordance with the Anglo-Soviet military agreement, and also published detailed reports of speeches and demonstrations in London and New York, in order to prevent the public's morale from wavering. Soviet radio stations have also issued broadcasts saying that we very much hope that the United Nations will launch a new operation. The American magazine "US News" published on July 20 also issued a criticism of the fact that Britain and the United States have been slow to launch a second front, saying that the Soviet Union has only heard various news about the formation of a second front from Britain and the United States, but there has been no actual preparation or action, which has been quite dissatisfied. At this time when the Soviet Union is facing the greatest crisis, rescuing the Soviet army has become the unanimous opinion of the Soviet Union. Therefore, on the issue of the formation of a second front, the Soviet Union's attitude towards Britain and the United States has become more rigid, and the future direction of the three countries may become more delicate as a result.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Mysterious Egypt (7) <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The second type of farmer belongs to the tenant farmer system. Some of them are lifelong long-term workers with relatively generous conditions. In addition to paying a small amount of land rent, they still have a lot of surplus, so their lives are relatively stable. There is also a type of short-term long-term worker who specializes in planting for others. The five to six tenths of the harvest they receive is only enough for daily living expenses. The remaining cotton, in addition to making clothes for themselves, is often insufficient for gifts for many festivals and the celebratory occasions of the landlords. Therefore, a tenant farmer often works for others for four or five years and still ends up with a debt.</p>
<p>General small landowners also suffer a lot. According to the estimate of a French person, M. Legrain, all the property of each small landowner is only worth 48 francs. They only have half a hectare of land, a humble house, a set of furniture, a cow, a bull or a mule, a few chickens and pigeons, a set of farm tools, and an old-fashioned plow in the garden.</p>
<p>As for the large landowners, they are all nobles, and the land rent they squeeze from the farmers is astounding. The purchase price of one hectare of land is only 175 francs, but the land rent collected each year is 500 to 600 francs. This is truly an incredible situation.</p>
<p>The high land rent is due to the rapid increase in population and the large number of farm laborers. The price of manual labor in Egypt is low, and work that is usually done by machines elsewhere is still done manually here, which is also the reason. Secondly, there is too little arable land. In recent years, there have been many improvements to this problem. They often develop wasteland, turning sand sources into sources of wealth.</p>
<p>Egyptian farmers suffer terribly under the landlords' extortion, coupled with the heavy interest exploitation of mortgage loan banks in recent years. Their economic situation can be regarded as the poorest in the world. As for the education and health of farmers, they are also extremely backward as a result.</p>
<p>They mostly live in huts made of sugarcane roots, and one room is often crowded. In addition, there are no windows, making the air very murky. They also suffer from malnutrition and overwork, so the mortality rate is very high. Fortunately, the productivity rate is even greater, so the population can increase daily. However, the child mortality rate is very alarming. Many adults suffer from gastrointestinal diseases due to eating too much corn, and epidemics are also common due to heat waves. In addition, due to wind and sand, the number of people with trachoma reaches 92%, which is certainly the highest in the world. Egypt also has many people with acute conjunctivitis and blindness. Therefore, there are eye hospitals everywhere in Egypt, and the 1937 World Ophthalmology Conference was also held in Cairo, Egypt.</p>
<p>Economic Miscellany</p>
<p>Before Mehemet Ali came to power in Egypt, all the land belonged to the emperor. Some nobles and wealthy people also had some private property, but most of the farmers were working for others. It was not until 1861 that Egypt had the term private land ownership. However, in recent years, the influence of foreigners has spread, and the economic aggression suffered has deepened. More than 34% of all land has been transferred into foreign hands. Farmers generally love their land, so why are they willing to sell their land to foreigners? The story is interesting. It turns out that most Egyptians believe in Islam. According to Islamic rules, believers who lend money to others are not allowed to charge interest. Therefore, wealthy farmers will not lend money to others, and poor farmers have no choice but to borrow from land mortgage loan banks established by foreigners at high interest rates. As a result, they cannot repay the loans when they are due, and the land falls into the hands of others. If the religious rules also prohibited believers from borrowing money from others with interest, the land in Egypt might still belong entirely to Egyptians today.</p>
<p>The Egyptians have also tried to remedy this land problem. For example, during the First World War, some people launched peasant cooperative banks to compete with foreign banks, but the results were still limited.</p>
<p>Before the 18th century, Egypt's monetary system used gold and silver coins, but now all that can be seen are British gold pounds, French francs, and Turkish currencies. If you want to see Egyptian coins, you have to go to a museum.</p>
<p>In 1898, the Egyptian government established a national bank and issued the first Egyptian banknotes. However, because the value of banknotes fluctuated with the amount of domestic cotton production, and the government did not enforce circulation, these banknotes were not seen in the countryside at all, except for circulation in a few large cities. As for the nickel coins issued in 1885, they are still circulating on the market today.</p>
<p>If the financial stability of a country is judged by the amount of its national debt, then Egypt should be a country with poor finances. Its annual revenue is approximately 2 million Egyptian gold coins, but the debt it must repay each year accounts for half of it. Egypt's economic weakness is one of the reasons why it is occupied by foreign powers.</p>
<p>There are many cotton tycoons in the United States. In Egypt, cotton itself is the tycoon. It is not only the tycoon of Egypt, but also the tycoon of all cotton in the world. All economic activities in Egypt depend on it, and the raw materials for clothing in Europe and Africa also depend on it.</p>

Separate bread coupons will also be issued to children between the ages of two and five to ensure equitable treatment for all. It is understood that the authorities will ascertain the number of people in each household from the initial bread registration forms.</p>
<p>Issued According to Registered Number of People</p>
<p>If a bread-consuming household has children between the ages of two and five, they can amend their original registration form at the management office at 209 Jiangxi Road. Bakeries will subsequently receive flour from the authorities, and the white or yellow bread coupons that each bakery and its distributors can obtain will also be determined based on the number of people listed on their registration forms. Furthermore, those who were eligible for rice coupons but now wish to obtain bread will be rejected. Those who have never received rice coupons can apply for registration at the Municipal Council Management Office.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Shanghai Bankers Association Approves Taxation of Hoarded Goods; Warehouse Hoarding Considered a Temporary Profiteering Business; Maximum Tax Rate Limited to 200 Per Mille <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The Joint Committee of the Shanghai Bankers Association and its members, in order to assist the authorities in curbing speculation and hoarding, has submitted and passed a resolution to levy a temporary profit tax on goods hoarded in various warehouses and stockpiles, in accordance with regulations. The resolution instructs all firms establishing warehouses and stockpiles to report the types, quantities, dates of entry and exit, and names of owners of stored goods on a bi-weekly basis for taxation purposes. This reporter learned from the Bankers Association that the temporary profit tax refers to income from the buying and selling of goods unrelated to the main business, and not calculated under the income of the main business, is considered a temporary profit business. Therefore, non-business individuals who buy and sell goods for profit are also regarded as temporary profit businesses and taxed according to their income. The tax rates are as follows: 30 per mille for income between 100 yuan and less than 1,000 yuan; 40 per mille for income between 1,000 yuan and less than 2,500 yuan; 60 per mille for income between 2,500 yuan and less than 5,000 yuan; and for income above 5,000 yuan, an additional 10 per mille is levied for each additional 1,000 yuan of income, with the maximum tax rate capped at 200 per mille. Those who withhold income tax or pay income tax themselves must report their income in the prescribed format to the tax authorities within one month of settlement. Failure to report or making false reports will be punished according to law, and in serious cases, may be subject to imprisonment or detention for up to one year.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Municipal Council Explains Scope of Retail Tax; All Transactions Except Wholesale Subject to Tax <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Council's Information Office announces that, according to reports, some shops still have unclear understanding of the scope of the 2 per mille retail tax levied by the Bureau on goods. The details are explained as follows:</p>
<p>Wholesale</p>
<p>Large-volume transactions of goods, quantified in loose form or calculated by baskets, packages, bags, etc., are not necessarily wholesale transactions.</p>
<p>A transaction constitutes a wholesale transaction regardless of the quantity of goods if any of the following conditions are met and the buyer intends to resell the goods: Manufacturers or their agents selling goods to formal merchants or retailers engaged in the same type of goods; Transactions between two businesses in the same industry; Manufacturers or merchants selling goods to factories, etc., and these goods are processed into other types of goods through industrial or manual processes. The above three types of transactions are not subject to the retail tax.</p>
<p>Consumption</p>
<p>If a buyer's identity and purpose of purchase are unknown to the seller, such transactions are subject to the retail tax, unless the buyer can provide proof (such as verifying membership in a trade association, etc.) that one of the above three conditions is met to qualify for tax exemption. If a buyer cannot or is unwilling to verify their business status and intention, the buyer should be regarded as a consumer and pay the retail tax accordingly.</p>
<p>Transaction</p>
<p>When a manufacturer or merchant of machinery sells a complete machine or parts to a factory, verification of the buyer's status and intention is extremely important. If the purchased machine, whether complete or partial, is used as part of the factory's equipment, such a transaction, in terms of the retail tax, constitutes a retail transaction and should be taxed accordingly.</p>
<p>In general, merchants should maintain detailed records of the names, addresses, and other information of buyers in all transactions that are wholesale in nature for inspection by the Municipal Council's staff.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Notice from the Shanghai Bankers Association: Standardization of Bills Issued by Firms <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Inconsistent Formats Lead to Repeated Disputes; Subsequent Bills Must Be Written in Uppercase to Show Seriousness</p>
<p>In order to standardize the bills issued by firms, the Shanghai Bankers Association has issued a special notice to its member firms: "To whom it may concern, recently, the numerals on the promissory notes and remittance slips issued by various firms in the industry have often been written in inconsistent formats, leading to repeated disputes and economic inefficiencies in both time and procedures. To remedy this, all firms must write numerals on bills in uppercase (e.g., 'one hundred' as '伯') to ensure standardization and seriousness. We hereby issue this notice for your compliance."</p>
<h3 id="e29">All Remaining Old Currency Held by Money Exchange Shops Must Be Reported <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Money Exchange Association received a notice on the 29th of last month that the carrying of old currency would be prohibited starting August 1st. The Association has recently issued a notice and prepared a "Remaining Old Currency Report Form," which has been distributed to money exchange shops. All money exchange shops must fill out the form in detail, listing the amounts of Central Bank, Bank of China, and miscellaneous banknotes (including banknotes from the Central Agricultural Bank, the Ningbo Commercial Bank, and the Zhongnan Bank), as well as worn and torn banknotes, stored in their vaults and submit it to the Association for disposal.</p>
<p>Notice from Songshan Road Police Station: Radio Registration Period</p>
<p>Since the implementation of radio registration in the French Concession last month, registrations have been extremely enthusiastic. However, the registration was temporarily suspended due to the exhaustion of registration forms, and a notice was issued to reschedule the registration. The police stations have separately notified each Lianbao to instruct residents with radios to register. The Songshan Road Police Station issued a special notice yesterday, ordering households within the 71st to 88th Lianbao to apply for registration between yesterday and the 8th, and those who fail to do so will be punished.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Rice Shops Fined <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>On August 1st, the French Concession police discovered the following rice shops in Shanghai engaging in fraudulent practices and irregularities while retailing rice, harming the public interest. Therefore, they were penalized: No. 66 Rue Louban, rice shop No. 577, fined 1,000 yuan; No. 55 Rue du Père Froc, rice shop No. 697, fined 750 yuan; No. 137 Rue du Père Froc, rice shop No. 699, fined 500 yuan; No. 404 Route de Zikawei, rice shop No. 764, fined 500 yuan; No. 94 Rue Amiral Courbet, rice shop No. 611, fined 1,500 yuan; No. 30 Route Marcel Tillot, rice shop No. 643, fined 1,500 yuan; No. 106 Route Wagner, rice shop No. 750, fined 1,500 yuan.</p>
<p>Fire Chief Returns to Post</p>
<p>The Municipal Council Information Office announced that Mr. Little, the Director of the Fire Department, has returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Nightclubs in Both Concessions Request Extension of Business Hours; Authorities Prepare to Consider</p>
<p>Nightclubs and other entertainment venues in both concessions have jointly requested the authorities to permit them to extend their business hours. The Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council are preparing to consider this request. However, the attitude of the two authorities towards this matter is still unpredictable. Recently, the Shanghai Western District Police Department permitted entertainment venues in the district to extend their closing time from 11 PM to 12:30 AM. Therefore, nightclubs in both concessions also intend to follow suit and request the authorities to accommodate them. The outcome will depend on whether the reasons they provide are legitimate.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Cause of the Careless Fire at Daoxiangcun on Sima Road <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>At 3:50 PM on the 31st of last month, a fire suddenly broke out on the upper floor of the Daoxiangcun tea and snack shop at No. 383 Fuzhou Road. Due to the early hour, the fire was very fierce. Fortunately, the Fire Brigade made every effort to extinguish it, averting a major disaster. Afterwards, the Laozha Police Station, under the jurisdiction, instructed Detective Zou Bolang to investigate. The investigation revealed that Shao Yikang rented the mezzanine floor of the shop. On the day of the fire, Shao's cousin, Wang Shangmao from Ningbo (who lives at No. 72 Qunyi Lane, Alcok Road), came to visit. As Wang was about to return home, he threw a cigarette butt onto the mezzanine floor. Although he tried to stomp it out with the sole of his shoe, he did not completely extinguish the embers, causing them to ignite the imitation ivory in the area and start the fire, leading to the disaster. The detectives determined that Shao should be held responsible for the fire and arrested him the day before yesterday for further investigation.</p>

<p>The day before yesterday (Sunday), the eldest son of Ms. Yang Nielingyu, the Principal of the Municipal Council Girls' School, Mr. Yang Lukun, married Ms. Li Di, the daughter of the scholar Mr. Li Yingnan, at the YMCA William Public Prayer Hall. The wedding ceremony was conducted with religious rites, solemnly and reverently, with a large number of guests, making it a grand occasion of the time.</p>

<p>This Newspaper Extends Acceptance of Birthday Gifts for One Day; Gifts Sent from Other Ports Will Still Be Accepted</p>
<p>Yesterday was Mr. Ding Fubao's 69th birthday. The number of people from all walks of life who came to the office to offer birthday wishes was almost overwhelming, reaching more than 300, and the amount of gift money was nearly 20,000 yuan, the highest record in the past ten days. This newspaper originally planned to stop accepting gifts yesterday, but in response to requests from all parties and due to procedural matters, the acceptance period has been extended for another day, until 5 PM today. Birthday gifts sent from other ports will still be accepted and announced in the newspaper.</p>
<p>Saving Banquet Expenses</p>
<p>Dr. Ding Huikang, Mr. Fubao's son, is a well-known tuberculosis specialist in Shanghai and the founder of the Hongqiao Sanatorium. He has a strong enthusiasm for tuberculosis prevention, public health, and charitable causes. For his father's birthday, he was instructed not to hold a celebratory banquet, and instead saved 10,000 yuan to benefit relatives and friends. This amount was sent to this newspaper yesterday to be donated to social causes. His enthusiasm and filial piety are admirable.</p>

<h3 id="e34">University Graduation <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>— Zongyi</p>
<p>This year, it ended earlier than usual, completing the academic program in May. This month was busy with the final exams, typing out theses day and night, and rushing to take graduation photos. Donning the square cap and raising one's head made one feel even more impressive than a PhD. In addition, there were farewell parties and tea parties, with students treating professors one day, professors treating students the next, and students treating students the day after. It was incredibly busy. Finally, everything was finished, and a temporary graduation certificate was in hand. However, the saying "graduation is unemployment" immediately loomed over our heads. Naturally, the first important thing after graduation is to find a job. Now, a month has passed like flowing water, and classmates have dispersed, each going their own way. Fortunately, more than a dozen bachelors of science from the Chemistry Department have not left Shanghai. Now, let me tell you about the recent experiences of some of these university graduates:</p>
<p>Take Lao Liu, for example. He was the oldest in the department, hence the nickname "Lao" (Old). Lao Liu's family circumstances are quite good. Although his father passed away, he inherited a considerable sum of money. He didn't study chemistry in vain. Now, he has opened a ×× Western pharmacy, specializing in buying and selling things like Uleron, Dajianhuang, and other Western medicines that are hard to pronounce, like Opatal, Prontosil, and Cibazol... Fortunately, he has a knack for making money. It is said that he earned over 70,000 on Shuangtao quinine alone. No wonder he recently treated several of us old classmates to tea at DD, S!</p>
<p>Guo Laofuzi (Old Master Guo) is called that because he usually continued his studies with stability and was very prudent, so he has the title of Old Master. Now, Guo Laofuzi has left his field and started doing business at the exchange. All day long, he's busy with Shuangma, Xiantao, Tongzijun factory orders, and what kind of Longtou, Feiyu, Sijunzi stack orders, also dealing in military bonds and stock market prices, so he's so busy that you can't even see his shadow. When you go to his house to find Old Master Guo, five or six times they say, "The young master has gone to the company." What kind of company it is, I don't know.</p>
<p>Now, those with money do big business, those with less money do small business, adults do business, and even children do business. Shanghai has become a "business world." Like Xiao Wang, he has brand-new ideas. With a flash of inspiration, he thought that summer is here, and there are so many people riding bicycles now, so the straw hat business is worth doing. So, he picked up his own old bicycle and ran around, selling large and small straw hats. From the most beautiful straw hats worn by foreigners to the most common Ningbo salt straw hats, they are piled up in a small room. He sews the ribbons himself, applies the colorful colors himself, delivers the goods himself, and acts as the manager himself. He also uses the money he earns himself. After a day of hard work, in addition to eating three full meals, he can also have pocket money for snacks and watch a movie. Now, he even has new suits, new shirts, and new leather shoes.</p>
<p>There are those who embrace optimism and those who embrace pessimism. Like our Dr. Zheng, he has the biggest ambition. He plans to have four sulfuric acid factories, two caustic soda factories, one large gas factory, and five chemical raw material companies in the future. He usually considers himself a doctor because of his profound knowledge. If you ask him why the sulfuric acid factory and caustic soda factory haven't been built yet, his answer is, "Now there are no foreign raw materials, now there are no foreign machines, how can I build a factory!" Maybe his knowledge is too broad, so he must have foreign goods to supplement it. He didn't think that foreign machines and raw materials are made by people. Now, the chemical concerto of the doctor has come to an end, and he is singing a love song. Unfortunately, the doctor is very good at learning, but he has no deep research on love. Now he has suffered a broken heart. The other party refused him because "love is not dedicated." The doctor had no choice but to sever ties from then on and finally became pessimistic, sleeping in in the morning and setting up a small fortune-telling stall in the Dahua air-conditioned dance hall in the afternoon, spending the whole day with a cup of tea.</p>
<p>There are also several female generals in the Chemistry Department. It is strange that the female generals are always better than the male students in their studies. Like our Miss Liu, she has an excellent memory and is the first in her studies. Almost all of her grades are A's. They live on Yuyuan Road, which is very close to "Wellcome and Evian." These days are really full of memories!</p>
<p>Ah, I forgot an important figure – A Zhang – he has served as the president of the Chemistry Association many times. He is popular among students and quite favored by professors, so students are very close to him and familiarly call him A Zhang. Now, "the wind has turned the sails." The other day, I saw him busy at the racecourse with a red card hanging around his neck, sometimes winning with number four, sometimes betting on a double of three and four, sometimes playing the lottery, which was enough to keep him busy all day. Now that the horse racing is over for the summer, he has gone to the dog racing track and the jai alai court. He spends the whole afternoon immersed in the names of people like Aranguren, Cubalong, Astier Olano... and the names of dogs like Mister Beer, Craford Fornelia, Wood Stoker Irving...</p>
<p>University graduation is such a moving term! University students are the backbone of society. At the same time, people in a chemistry department have "different sacred careers." As for how they are to society, I dare not criticize, let alone draw conclusions. I only hope that they remember that society needs talent, and even more so, university talent. At the same time, I hope they look up to themselves and respect themselves.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Anonymous Elderly Man Generously Benefits the Poor <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Donated and Raised Huge Sums of Money</p>
<p>Our newspaper's third reader scholarship fund received a generous donation of 2,000 yuan yesterday from an anonymous elderly man, and 1,000 yuan raised by Father. The anonymous elderly man is a sincere and honest elder in the business world. When our newspaper's first scholarship campaign began, the elderly man was the first to respond, generously donating a huge sum of money, but did not want his name to be known to the world. He also generously donated a large sum of money for the second scholarship fund and gave many instructions on the direction of the scholarship. Not only are the colleagues of our newspaper deeply grateful, but also countless poor students are grateful. Now, we are grateful to the elderly man for his third donation, which has greatly increased the scholarship fund. Such an elderly man is worthy of being a role model for readers. We are also deeply grateful to Mr. Qian Junchuan for raising 1,000 yuan through an anonymous person.</p>
<p>Juelu's Donation</p>
<p>The newly opened Juelu Singing Hall, in order to protect the poor students, yesterday allocated 500 gold from the income of the ticket. The original letter said, "Respectfully, the 'Poor Scholarship Movement' promoted by your newspaper is receiving more and more responses, and people from all walks of life admire it. Since our company's singing hall officially opened on August 1, we will allocate a portion of the front desk ticket income on that day, totaling 500 yuan in banknotes, to donate to the reader's scholarship fund" to provide relief, to show service to the people, and to encourage poor students, who are happy not to forget to do good, and also to accumulate merit for all the audience.</p>

<p>Jin Yin'gen, the owner of Changxing Flower Shop at No. 519 Xiafei Road, Pudong, had a dispute with Wang Weiyuan, the owner of Jinxiuzhai Jewelry Store at No. 521 Kunling Road. It was decided that late at night on June 27, he would wield a knife, climb over the wall, and break into the Jinxiuzhai pavilion to kill Wang. Wang happened to be going to Su the next day, so he was spared. He killed Wang's five-year-old adopted son, Wang Mian, and tried to rape Wang's sixteen-year-old adopted daughter, Qu Huide, but failed. He stabbed Qu. After the case occurred, Jin was arrested by the French Concession Police and sent to court for detention. During the investigation, Jin also confessed that Wang Weiyuan's stepmother, Ms. Wang, and Tang Wenxiang (22 years old, Jiading native, now a partner at Jiermei Jewelry at No. 533 Xiafei Road), a former partner of Jinxiuzhai, etc., had a conspiracy and accomplice relationship. The detectives subsequently arrested Ms. Wang Weiyuan and Tang Wenxiang and other three people and detained them for a joint investigation. The details have been recorded in the newspapers. Now, one of the names, Tang Wenxiang, suddenly fell ill at 7:00 am on the 2nd in the detention center of the General Patrol Room. The guard reported to the patrol chief and sent him to Guangci Hospital, but it was too late to save him. The body was transferred to the coroner's office. Yesterday, his wife, Ms. Tang Zhong, and his father-in-law, Zhong Aquan, claimed the body for burial.</p>

<h3 id="e39">Gateball Charity Match Invites Eight Men's and Women's Teams to Participate <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Opening Order to be Announced Soon</p>
<p>The Changyin Cup Gateball Charity Match has been progressing smoothly since the establishment of the league committee. Five men's teams, including Youlian, Nanyang, Huanan, Tongren, and Zhonglian, and three women's teams, including Youdui, Aiguo, and Lingsheng, are invited to participate in the competition. The elimination system is adopted. The opening ceremony is scheduled to be held at Guangxia Middle School this Sunday (9th) afternoon. The strength of the four men's teams is very even. Nanyang recently won the first Guobin Cup Gateball Championship, and its momentum is strong. Although Huanan was the runner-up in the cup competition, the match against Nanyang was a 2-2 draw, so its strength is no less than Nanyang's. Youlian is a newly emerging organization, but it has a history of several years in the basketball world. This time, it is rising again, with a strong lineup and the same prestige as before. Tongren, known as the Xuan family class, dominates the basketball world and is as famous as Huanan. It is also one of the strong teams. At that time, the four strong teams will compete for the championship, which will be exciting and tense. The ticket sales have been good since the beginning. Yesterday, Zhao Yinsheng of Shengsheng Company purchased 100 honorary tickets, totaling 500 yuan, and Cheng Ying, the red dancer of Paramount, purchased 100 tickets, totaling 500 yuan. As for the opening order, it will be arranged and announced within days.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Talking about Wang Tao's Letters <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Wang Tao's Letters 7, a total of eighteen pages, have been mounted into a post. I obtained it from the used bookstore on Kader Road for 30 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates. It is as joyful as finding gold by sifting sand (from the "Used Bookstore" article on the 22nd), which must be recorded.</p>
<p>Wang, from Changzhou, Qing Dynasty, styled Ziquan, sobriquet Ziju, father styled Zhongtao, another sobriquet Tiannan Dun Sou. Capable in poetry, skilled in parallel prose. During the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods, he was an official in Guangdong, and communicated with Hong Yang. After Hong Yang pacified Jinling, he opened the imperial examinations to recruit scholars. Wang took the examination and obtained the first place, which surprised people at the time. After Hong Yang was defeated, he fled to Hong Kong and founded the Circulation Daily. Then he traveled to Europe and the United States, and personally witnessed the Franco-Prussian War. He wrote the Franco-Prussian War Record. He then traveled to Japan and wrote the Fuso Travelogue. During the Guangxu period, he returned to Shanghai and lectured at the Gezhi Academy. He wrote the Taoyuan Anthology, Yingru Magazine, Songyin Manlu, and Yongyou Yutan.</p>
<p>These seven letters contain about three thousand words, including eight poems. The paper and ink are very exquisite. He wrote a handwritten collection of Wang Xizhi's Sacred Teachings Preface. It was given to his friend Wu Guangxu. Wu's life is unknown, but it can only be known from the letter that his name is Hao. He once followed Huang Gongdu, a Sichuan envoy to Japan, and worked as a counselor. He had a very deep relationship with Wang Tao, or even a sworn brotherhood. In several letters, Wang referred to himself as his younger brother and Wu as his elder brother.</p>
<p>Most people regard Zhu Tao as a monster of the late Qing Dynasty, largely because he was born as a Taiping Rebellion champion. In the past, Jian Youwen (i.e., Dahua, martyr) and Xie Yuyao were in Shanghai. Both of them were experts in the study of the Taiping Rebellion historical materials. The reporter accidentally talked about this person with them, and they unanimously believed that Wang was just a scholar in his true colors, with arrogance. He thought he had a belly full of knowledge that was in line with the current evils, but no one paid attention to him, so he could not help but become indignant, and he and Su Dongpo, Wang Anshi, and others were all of the same kind. At that time, the reporter was ashamed of his shallow knowledge. I could only agree. Now, after carefully reading Wang's letters, I know that the two people's criticism of the characters is truly insightful.</p>
<p>Wang likes to scold people. In just seven letters, the pen touched Huang Gongdu, Ma Xiangbo, Ma Meishu, and Li Hongzhang. These are all figures with a reputation for a generation, and they all have shortcomings in his eyes. The most severely scolded person is Li Hongzhang, who said: "He is full of vulgar bones, has the face of an official, is superficial and frivolous, and has no ink in his chest." Criticizing Huang Gongdu said: "Since Gongdu took office in Jinshan, his political reputation is good. I love his talent but despise his person, because his heart is deep and he has the wind of a cat laughing at scales. It is not something that people like me who are bright and upright can say. If he gains power and changes his behavior one day, he will also be Wang Qinruo's type! Alas, how terrible!" Frankly speaking, Li Huang is naturally not worthy of being called a perfect person, but as he said, it seems too much. From this, one can imagine a glimpse of Wang's madness.</p>
<p>People who like to scold people mostly consider themselves extraordinary. He is not only self-confident, but also extremely enthusiastic, and sometimes even thinks that he can turn the world around with his own hands. In Guangxu's Renwu year (1882), France sent troops to Vietnam and started a war with us. The Qing government, with its weak power, intended to retreat and ordered Ma Meishu to take on the responsibility of defense. In a letter to Wu, he expressed distrust that Ma could win this negotiation. "Now the Vietnam matter, the peace and war are still undecided, but as I see it, the French may not dare to completely break off our friendship, nor may they be willing to give up their land. It will probably still end with France returning the city captured in Vietnam, Vietnam compensating France for the cost of raising troops, and theoretically they are wrong and we are right, and in terms of momentum they are far away and we are near. With Meishu's talent, taking on this important task, whether he can transform their conflict into friendship and eliminate the disaster invisibly, I secretly doubt it..." The tone is straightforward, and there is a strong "Let me do it" meaning. In the nineteenth year of Guangxu, Wang's enthusiastic emotions had probably reached a fever pitch. He claimed: "I have been studying soldiers for ten years, and I have not established a name. I have a full heart of enthusiasm, and I intend to take this opportunity to spit it out." The last paragraph: "If the authorities pity talent as my brother said, there are still unsaid words, and the anger that fills my chest will be detailed." A enthusiasm for volunteering is vividly on paper.</p>
<p>Here, the reporter has many feelings. There is a saying: "A scholar rebels, and nothing will be achieved in three years," which is really a supreme truth. Scholars' knowledge is mostly obtained from books, and they have little practical experience. Even if they speak logically, they are still just talking on paper. After the middle of the Qing Dynasty, after experiencing changes, the court and the people formed fire and water. The ignorant and incompetent people in power are certainly unbearable, but what good have the narrow-minded people done to the cause.</p>
<p>It is inevitable for a scholar to be out of touch with the times and to be poor. Wang was poor and so poor that he was helpless. One letter said that he lacked money for medicine and asked Wu for a loan of forty fans. The small amount of forty fans could not be obtained locally and had to be appealed to thousands of miles away (Wu was working in Japan at the time), which could not but be regarded as a pitiful act. It is useless to be a scholar, which is a sigh throughout the ages. (Recorded by Pan Zhuxin in July of the thirty-first year of the Republic of China)</p>

<p>Yesterday, the dark market for public debt continued to rise, because there were still many buyers. The market price was still slowly rising step by step. Unfortunately, due to the tight money supply and high overnight rates, it was inevitably hindered. Therefore, there were still many floating sellers.

<p>Yesterday, although new buyers were active in the Chinese stock market, it was difficult to reverse the declining trend of the past two weeks.

<p>Xin Jin Vegetable Market Slightly Loosened</p>
<p>The southern transport area for Xin Jin vegetables from Xuzhou is temporarily limited to Shanghai. The return of goods has also been confirmed. However, there are no clear regulations for Nanjing, so the needs of the Nanjing market are temporarily purchased from Zhenjiang. Therefore, the Zhenjiang market tightened again after being relaxed. It once reached four hundred yuan. Yesterday's telegram showed a slight relaxation of ten or twenty yuan, but the situation for Shanghai-bound shipments remains precarious. Dealers are observing and not acting. The subsequent purchase here has a firmness within the softness, and yesterday's requests to open were made.</p>

Large wholesalers are all hoarding. It is observed that Japanese people prefer to wear these black and gray colors, and recently, many Chinese people are also specifically buying them, creating a supply shortage for black and gray woolen fabrics.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Pufferfish <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Mo Ran</p>
<p>People know that pufferfish is delicious; those who have eaten it feel that "after eating pufferfish, everything else tastes bland." However, pufferfish is poisonous, so some say, "Risk your life to eat pufferfish."</p>
<p>For years, those who have manipulated prices and hoarded goods have been like eating pufferfish. No legitimate business offers the generous profits that hoarders and manipulators enjoy. Even today, they dream of the deliciousness of pufferfish, but with the strictness of current prohibitions, hoarders who still want to eat pufferfish are simply courting disaster.</p>
<p>We have long worried about these pufferfish eaters, but the consumption of pufferfish has spread from the head of the household to wives, daughters, and even teenagers, and elderly servants are also involved in hoarding. Only now do they realize that pufferfish is poisonous. Once ingested, even with enemas, suffering is unavoidable. Therefore, we hope that those who have not eaten pufferfish will be careful.</p>
<p>"Vegetables from the garden are even more precious than delicacies." Please do not eat pufferfish!</p>
<h3 id="e52">Rather "Increase Income" Than "Cut Expenses" <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Qing</p>
<p>Opening the page of today's life, you wouldn't have imagined it five or six years ago, and even today last year, when everyone was struggling under the burden of coping with difficulties in life, no one expected the cost of living to soar to what it is today. If they could have imagined it, they would have wondered how they could survive.</p>
<p>Now, the high cost of living is a reality that everyone experiences. Everyone is still alive, except for a very small number who have seized opportunities and are living even more luxuriously than five or six years ago. It is easy to understand that millions are barely able to breathe under this high pressure.</p>
<p>Sighing and thinking about "the beginning" from memories is just looking for trouble. Dreaming of a "dream-like" future is even more boring. To live, the way of life needs to be reviewed.</p>
<p>The meaning of this sentence, simply explained, is that if you feel that your current life is difficult (and it certainly is), you must first ask yourself if you are willing to endure this difficulty. Otherwise, you should think of a way.</p>
<p>We often hear this said: Life is too difficult, we should "cut expenses" a little.</p>
<p>Of course, economically "cutting expenses" may be a way to make life less difficult. However, thoroughly analyzed, it is too passive. In today's high-pressure living environment, most people are already living the bare minimum and most difficult life, so there is really nothing left to "cut." Even if you can "cut expenses," how much can you cut? Moreover, the cost of living is rising all the time, making it impossible for you to "cut" anything.</p>
<p>Therefore, cutting expenses is not a good way to actively alleviate the difficulties of life. My opinion is:——</p>
<p>Rather than "cutting expenses," it is better to "increase income"!</p>
<p>When you read this, you will immediately retort: Since there is nothing left to "cut," is there any "source" to "increase"?</p>
<p>True, on the surface, although there is nothing to "cut," you can at least "cut" a little. "Increasing income" is not something that can be done everywhere, I understand that. The reason I say this is that, in any case, "increasing income" is an active way to alleviate the difficulties of life.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example: You are a married couple. When you feel that your monthly salary is not enough to support a small family, you try to send your wife back to your hometown. This belongs to the "cutting expenses" route, which is passive. But you should know that your wife still needs to live when she returns home, and your own life may not necessarily become more stable. If you "increase income," it should be like this: your wife also dedicates herself to society and finds work (wives without ability or knowledge may no longer exist in our group). This will not only improve your living environment, but also enhance your wife's social experience.</p>
<p>This is just an example. In short, the main purpose of "increasing income" is to strengthen labor force, which is broader in scope than "cutting expenses." Whether direct or indirect, it is active and helps society's construction and productivity, in addition to the individual.</p>

<h3 id="e54">A Little Girl <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Yi</p>
<p>Friend! Aren't you saying that the little girl who is staring blankly at the window seems to have something on her mind? That's right! She has something on her mind. —In a few hours, she will be forced to do something she doesn't want to do: that is, to fall into prostitution, into a pit of fire. Don't be surprised, please sit down and let me give you a detailed account. You have asked about her many times, and today I should give you a satisfactory answer.</p>
<p>Aren't you suspicious that the one she calls "Mama" is not her biological mother? That's right. She was originally from the countryside. She came to Shanghai as a refugee. Four years ago, her biological mother sold her to a prostitute for a price of one hundred and fifty yuan and a term of six years to be a foster daughter. Soon, this prostitute was hired by a comprador named Liang Zhu, and borrowed the upper floor of our building as a golden house to hide her beauty. That is Mr. Chen, who comes by chartered car every Saturday, and her current Mama, she lives here as a foster daughter.</p>
<p>You asked about the situation in her hometown? Her hometown originally ran a candy store, and now they are gradually restoring their former situation. She has an older brother who often writes to her, hoping that she will go back. But her sale period is still two years away, and the redemption price for the years not yet served must include the losses of past food, lodging, and clothing. I'm afraid that a small candy store is not enough! Oh, you say that eating and playing like this is more comfortable than living in the countryside? She doesn't think so. At her age, she should already have a family concept, and besides, she has studied. She knows from books that her current position will not be respected.</p>
<p>Endure for two years? Aren't you saying that she only needs to endure until she completes her term as a foster daughter? Alas, the reality is not that simple! Her "Mama" is a ruthless old prostitute, and a outdated comprador is not providing enough for her expenses. So, she doesn't forget her roots and prepares to return to her old business. To avoid the comprador's interference, she uses this little girl as capital to invest in cooperation with others, In the "business," she is retiring from the "manager" position to become a "director." That's right! That is to make this little girl a prostitute. Tomorrow, it will happen tomorrow!</p>
<p>Save her? You blame me for standing by and not helping? Alas, although the girl has expressed a desire for help to me, without substantial economic power, how can I fulfill my due obligations?</p>
<p>She once asked me if I would ridicule her or despise her. Do you know how I answered her? I said: I can only ridicule myself and despise myself, because I am a human being, and I cannot save another human being. Do you think I am right?</p>
<p>What? You say this is also a social problem. Friend, whenever you are dissatisfied with reality, you always call it a problem with a broad name, thinking that you can escape your responsibilities. But I cannot agree. When things in the universe have an impact on humanity, it is the responsibility of humanity itself, especially the human community. We cannot save her, but we cannot abandon our responsibility as human beings, what do you think? (Proceeds go to scholarship fund)</p>

<h3 id="e56">What Books to Read <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— Jie Ren</p>
<p>We must understand the truth, guide social improvement, and create great undertakings. We must first obtain real knowledge; to obtain real knowledge, we can only seek it in books. Human knowledge is progressing every day, and if you don't try to keep up, you will fall behind. It is especially important to cultivate the habit of reading and to seek interest in knowledge.</p>
<p>The books in the world worth reading are truly as vast as the sea. Zhuangzi said: "My life has a limit, but knowledge has no limit. To pursue the unlimited with the limited is dangerous!" If you don't choose carefully, it is impossible in terms of economic time and spirit.</p>
<p>What books should we read?</p>
<p>In terms of personal cultivation: we should read biographies of great people from all over the world, so that we can learn the right way to strive and work hard in life from the lives of past great people, and indirectly transform your life and career achievements.</p>
<p>In terms of business: you must read books related to your own business, and gain more knowledge in your field. This is especially important for young professionals. The knowledge acquired in school is mostly general, so when you first enter society, you feel that your knowledge is lacking and not practical. People engaged in professional occupations must use their spare time to do research and exploration work to improve their business knowledge and work ability in order to improve and succeed.</p>
<p>As for leisure education: you should read more appreciative books to increase mental pleasure, so that you can truly understand the meaning of life, and can guide people to progress towards a happier path.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Shih said: "We should read more books, no matter what books we read. Often a very ordinary book contains a very big hint." People's lives are now very busy, and there is not enough time to read, especially for part-time readers, time is infinitely precious to them, so they must spend the least amount of time reading the most useful books, and use the least amount of energy to obtain the greatest effect.</p>

<p>(Seven) — Swift Thunder</p>
<p>Wei Cheng said, "Probably after eating these things of theirs, more trouble came later." Mrs. Ye Er said, "Originally, your father's wedding date was set for September of next year, but as a result, your mother was married over in December of that year. Do you know why? First, after the Li family and the Ye family became related, another family came out of nowhere to propose marriage to the Li family. This matter spread from one to ten, ten to a hundred, and everyone knew about it far and wide. Secondly, after those two strange matchmakers came, one night, the Li family suddenly suffered a robbery. When the robbers entered the house, they didn't rob anything, they didn't want money, they only asked who was Miss Li Mingyun. Coincidentally, your mother was sending a cousin back and stayed at her cousin's house that night and was not harmed. Thirdly, after this bizarre robbery case occurred in the Li family, less than ten days later, two old women, with yellow cloth bags on their backs, pretended to be begging for alms, but they stared at your mother with dead eyes, and your mother's heart jumped violently. Your grandmother felt that once, twice, three times, Cheng Bing was behind it all, and she was very uneasy. Therefore, she urged this side to get married early, hoping that everything would be fine from then on. Who knew that in the months before the wedding, and for nearly a year after the marriage, your mother received several letters, all written by Cheng Bing. One letter stated that he had called off his engagement to his original fiancee for your mother's sake, spent countless sums of money for your mother's sake, and that his face was haggard, his spirit was haggard, and he simply asked your mother to stand under a big locust tree outside the village on a certain night, and someone would come to pick her up. Your mother naturally burned the letter. In later letters, Cheng Bing used the name of a woman and called your mother a sister. Some of these letters fell into your father's hands. Your father was a meticulous person and found it very strange that this sister was so busy writing letters, so he asked your mother. Your mother was loyal to her husband and told her husband the whole story. Your father was so angry that he almost lost it, and immediately went to Ant Mound Town to visit. It is said that your father met Cheng Bing, and after a few words, he came back and told your mother. Your mother only advised him to let things rest? But later disasters were thus sown."</p>
<p>Life Snippets</p>
<h3 id="e58">The Hardships of Home <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi Yin</p>
<p>My wife had always yearned for Shanghai. It was not until November of last year that her dream came true, but it was after several difficult and dangerous journeys that she arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<p>At that time, a triumphant smile appeared on her haggard face, but her painful emotions stimulated me. To live in Shanghai, I estimated that the financial burden would be at least twice as much as living in the countryside. For example, in the countryside, we had our own house, and we could also chop some firewood from our own mountain as fuel, and we could often cut vegetables from our own vegetable garden... But now, the house, coal briquettes, vegetables, and even tap water and emptying the chamber pot... everything had to be paid for.</p>
<p>Bearing the heavy burden, I first found a place to live with the utmost difficulty, and then bought some furniture and utensils. A home was barely established. I thought that we could depend on each other from now on and share happiness and hardship. Unexpectedly, life after that was not as stable as my wife had imagined. Indeed, there was the prosperity she yearned for, but besides watching the rush of streetcars and cars, the tall buildings standing on the horizon, and listening to the unfamiliar jazz music on the radio... what else could she experience? Abandoned babies by the trash cans, corpses on the open roads... these were the sad scenes she had seen after coming to Shanghai, she once told me this.</p>
<p>Moreover, it can be said that rice, coal briquettes, and other daily necessities were becoming increasingly difficult to obtain. In fact, even if they could be obtained with difficulty, the rate of increase in economic levels was really beyond what I could bear. I had to reconsider the possibility of continuing to live in Shanghai. After considering the results, I felt that the only thing to do was to have my wife return to her hometown.</p>
<p>My wife was very understanding of our current situation. Although she was very unwilling emotionally, she finally painfully agreed.</p>
<p>Three months ago, I sent my wife, with her melancholy face, back to her hometown's wharf.</p>
<p>Coming and going in a hurry, I was deeply saddened by the teasing of life, which caused endless depression, but when I thought that the burden of life should be lightened from now on, I couldn't help but feel a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>But for the past three months, the letters from my wife that had been sent one after another still brought me heavy depression. She told me, almost resentfully:</p>
<p>"...You were wrong! Back in the countryside, we don't have to pay rent for the house, but the taxes here and there can be worth the rent of a three-story building in Shanghai. Yes, fuel doesn't need to be bought, but some of the firewood in the mountains has been stolen, so the family still needs to spend money to buy firewood for fuel, and the price is similar to that of coal briquettes, except that there is no need to squeeze and jostle as in Shanghai. Oh, I'll tell you, the price of rice here is also rising rapidly, and now it also costs five hundred yuan per stone. Oil, salt, cloth... which one is not rising day and night? In short, I am now living in the countryside, and the consumption is about the same as when I lived in Shanghai last year. It's not a penny less, so I still want to move the home back to Shanghai..." "I still want to go back to Shanghai!" I was really afraid of the family returning to Shanghai. The changes in my hometown in the past few months were beyond my expectations, but my wife didn't know that Shanghai was no longer the Shanghai of three months ago!</p>
<p>I told my wife: "Let us endure the hardships again! Today's Shanghai is probably completely different from the Shanghai you had contact with! No matter what it is, the cost of living here is obviously two or three times higher than it was three months ago! Therefore, I beg you, don't have the idea of coming out again..."</p>
<p>Thinking of the suffering family, under the heavy burden of life, I couldn't help but feel at a loss.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Life <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Yu</p>
<p>Prices are rising, life is difficult, cholera is prevalent... Life is as fragile as a piece of thin paper.</p>
<p>Even young people are shaking their heads and sighing, some are shouting "bored," and some are indulging in pleasure.</p>
<p>Shouting bored and indulging in pleasure are wasting life.</p>
<p>Life is indeed fragile, but should it be wasted?</p>
<p>I remembered what the protagonist in a novel said:</p>
<p>"What is most precious to a person is life, and life is only once for us. A person's life should be lived like this: when he looks back on the past, he will not regret wasting his years, nor will he be ashamed of his past mediocrity."</p>
