<h3>關於錫蘭島　與其開國的神話</h3>
<p>南海戰事繼續蔓延，古佛國的錫蘭島也受到戰火的威脅了。</p>
<p>錫蘭是佛敎的聖地，又適當印度洋交通孔道，所以從很早就著聞於世。西歷一世紀時以身殉維蘇威火山和龐貝城的殷林尼（Pliny　the　Elder,)其所著「自然厯史（Natnral　Aistory)」中即會提到該地，名之爲　Taprobane；同時的哀利特里亞海周游記（The　Periplns　of　theErythraean　Sea）則謂之爲　Palaesimmden（佛法之意，）此外更有　Salika,Sihalaka　等等名稱，都指的是這一島嶼。到第四世紀開始見　Serendivi　之名，也就是後來錫蘭島的名稱所由起。在中國方面關於錫蘭的知識也很早，吳孫權時康泰奉使扶南（今　羅東部一帶，）歸來撰扶南土俗傳，其中提到「斯調洲，」據法國學者伯希和的意見就是錫蘭古名　Sihadiva的譯音，這見解大槪是不錯的。但中國古代對錫蘭最通行的名稱是師子國（或獅子國，）這名稱始見於晋法顯的佛國記，玄奘的西域記中名之爲僧伽羅國或無憂國。後一名稱是因爲釋迦示寂後無憂王曾在此地宜揚佛法，至於僧伽羅國和師子（獅子）國則都是　Sihalaka　的譯文，只是一爲譯音一爲譯義而已。</p>
<p>關於師子（獅子）國名稱的起源，大唐西域上有一段有趣的神話，據說從前南印度有一國王，聘公主赴鄰國成婚，途中忽逢獅子，護送的官兵都紛紛逃避，委棄公主於乘與而去。於是公主便被獅子負入深山，配爲夫婦，生有子女各一，其子長大，異常勇健，及至人智漸通，乃詢母以父獅母人之故，其母備述原委，乃勸其母伺獅父不在，奔返本國。其時該國王宗祀已絕，不得已投至民家，受人資給爲生。及至獅子還穴，不見妻子，憤　之餘，往返村邑尋覓，頗肆殘暴。國王不勝其擾，乃懸重賞徵募能往除息的勇士，共子爲飢寒所迫，竞往應募，不聽其母阻勸，逕赴山林尋覓獅父。獅見子來，忿怒頓息，馴伏示愛，其子竞以刃刺獅腹死之。國王感覺驚異，追詢原委，認爲除蕃有功，殺父大逆，乃重賞共母，留於國中，另備大船，流放子女，共子泛船至於錫蘭，見當地富有珍寶，即留該島，共後子孫繁息，以共先祖除獅有功，即以獅子爲國號云云。此類傳說，在各原始民族往往有之，有如　族之於狗，突厥之於狼，都傳說是獸類後裔，以近代民俗學知識來解釋，大概所謂獅子狗狼之類，都只是各該族往昔民族時代的圖騰而已。</p>
<p>據說釋迦曾化身僧伽羅，降生該島，以後即在當地示寂，因此在佛書上有許多關於錫蘭島的故事，有如僧伽羅降羅刹女即此種著名故事之一。以是島中佛祖遺跡往往而在。有如無畏山（Abhayagiri)　的巨大佛殿和佛塔，亞常峯的佛陀足跡，都是有名的古蹟。關於那一足跡，雖然回敎和婆羅門敎各自有所解釋，但在法顯遊記已以之屬於佛陀，，在中國各種載記中大概都從佛跡之說，只有　涯勝覽因爲著者馬歡是回敎人，獨立主張亞當足跡的回敎傳說。</p>
<p>鍚蘭自古即以盛產珍珠寶石著名，所以在佛經上亦稱之爲寶渚（Ratnadvipa)·這一「獅子後裔」的珠寶之國，此次是否能够倖免於砲火的洗禮呢？怕只有未來的歷史纔能回答。</p>

<p>自荷印無條件屈服後，澳洲大陸，有被日軍往叩門戶的可能，澳聯邦政府已授權軍事當局，於必要時，有權破地道路。公路。鐵路綫，運河，飛行塲，船塢和堤岸等建築物，這是所謂「焦土戰略。」澳洲的人力物力，在此次大戰中，協約國所寄其期望的，非常殷切。牠的富源，若蔗糖，木材，羊，牛，水菓，麥，乳酪和大量的礦產，於遙遠的途程中，不斷地供給牠的宗邦—英國。「上圖」澳洲的木材，隨地可取，尤其是澳洲西部，其最大的樹，有長至二八〇呎和直徑達二四呎者。「下圖」歐洲的羊毛和羊肉，大都出在澳洲一萬四千萬隻的羊身上，有些羊每年可剪毛三次，像這圖上的羊，僅最渺小者之最渺小的一羣而已。</p>

<p>本報特稿</p>
<h3>「印度精神」輪迴的神秘性</h3>
<p>一看見紅頭阿三那張「印度照會」，誰也會感覺到些許神秘。滿臉滿嘴的捲毛　鬚，刺叢般的雨條濃眉，搭拉在圓溜溜的眼睛上面，一隻肥大而且油滴滴的鼻子，堆滿了紅黑相兼的顆粒刺疣，鼻孔被兩撮毛塞得結結實實地，眞不知道怎樣呼吸的。</p>
<p>神秘？阿三的神秘究竟在那裏？第一當然是一年四季盤在頭上的那一大堆，其次就要輸到那一雙昏懂懂像魔夢着的一雙眼睛；又像兩隻黑森森的洞，又像測不透的深淵；臉是看不出的，全是毛，一塌糊塗的毛，當然叫人瞧着有些阿　而又神秘；還有一點就是那不時像呻吟又像夢囈般的喃喃細語——據說是唪着印度敎經。</p>
<p>然而這些並不足以代表「印度精神」的神秘。</p>
<p>譬如參考約翰·根塞所寫的「亞洲內幕」Inside　Asia，提到印度國的神秘玩意兒，類如開鎖要反着轉，鐵道是三條軌，旅館不裝門，也不用鈴，人的名字，名放在第一，姓在第二，並且每人名姓上必得把族名裝在上面算公姓；數目頓位的百位以上，是兩個數字一頓，誓如一千萬的寫法是「一，〇〇，〇〇，〇〇〇」叫作一拉克司，等等。</p>
<p>這些，叫我們敝中國人看來，也並不神秘；更用不着打驚失怪，見神疑鬼。此外傳聞印度阿三的兩隻手要分別派用塲，右手很高尙，只有右手才可以抓飯伸到口裏，左手就祗能在出恭之後做些零碎服務，如用草紙之類，等級劃分得很嚴，雖在軍情如火，大難臨頭的一刹那，這雙手的職務是不能弄錯的。</p>
<p>這是小事一件，不足爲奇。可是朝大處着眼，確也有些令人難解的地方。誓如，看過些關於印度問題書的人，誰也要說印度是個窮國，全國的乞丐連托缽僧在內，觸目皆是；然而在沒有被英人侵佔的五百六十二個土王小國內，每價土王就富得述自己也不知道有多少金珠寶貝和共他財產。至於說到人物，却很可以數出幾位鼎鼎大名的人物來，有男詩人泰戈爾，女詩人潘秋德，政界的尼赫魯，回敎領袖眞納，和一百十二磅重的聖雄甘地。像甘地這樣的人物，在英國朝野的眼光中，就把他沒有辦法，一來就自己鐕到牢裏去，不肯出來。再來就拒絕吃飯，乾餓，一餓就是十幾二十天，滿不在乎。英人只能在這七十三歲瘦小的老頭兒面前屈服，還得稱呼他是「當代的救主耶穌」。</p>
<p>還有些奇怪的事，在恒河邊樹林內，我們如要肯跑一趟的話，就可看見很多修道隱士，在地上，或荊棘叢裏，或樹枝上打坐。坐得一年到頭，不肯起來。聽說—也許是齊東野語—有的隱士坐的年數太多，他們的手脚指甲，長得同枯藤一般盤在身上，和草藤結在一齊，分扯不開，也有的頭髮鬍鬚長得同樹枝糾纏在一起。</p>
<p>論到宗教，也許有些難解的神秘性。數類之多，不可勝數，拜牛·拜鼠·拜猴·拜烏·各從其類，都是一教；不過總括起來，只是印度敎·回敎·兩個大宗。所引以爲神秘民，這兩敎的人常常處在敵對的地位上，芥蒂極深。信印度敎者佔全國百分之六十六，約二萬三千九百萬人，回敎則僅七千七百萬，然因回敎徒多是兵勇，秉性剽悍，所以這兩敎的衝突，在所難免，並且影響到政治上面，全國常年，就不大能够安頓。</p>
<p>兩敎相同的一點，就是不和「卑賤」的爪哇地人　Dravidian　來往。豈僅不來往，要是爪哇地人，來不及　避，踏着了兩敎人的影子，或是他們的影子掠過了兩敎人的身上，這就算他們敎徒觸了霉頭，得鄭鄭重重的來一回法事唪經，纔可解除乾凈。</p>
<p>關於工農兩業也有些希奇古怪，全國百分之六十六的人口是務農爲業，然而出產的米麥總是不大够用，好在有茶葉和棉花佔着極高的農產指數。全國北部是地主佃工制，南部則是小農主，自耕自食；這倒不算特別，所不同的是佃戶情形與我國有點兩樣，名稱佃戶，其實只是傭工，而傭工的工錢却細微得叫人難以相信，每季每日每工只有大洋一毛。然而還比較廠工的工資却還高出了五分之一，因爲廠工每日碌碌十餘小時，只能掙到大洋八分：豈不少得可憐？一個出賣性命的礦工，要是得到五個　比一星期就算了不起了。所以英國人說，天下之大，人工之廉，數到中國已經算得無法再廉的了，而印度却偏偏還要廉到不足　爲數目的地步，豈非奇事？</p>
<p>緣故也許是因爲印度工業太落伍：全國只有兩種工業，紡織（多係手工）和少許的鋼鐵製造。可是全國工人雖僅佔全國人口十分之一，然數目却也到了三千五百萬名口之多。其最奇特的一點，名廠却有一個總工頭，向廠主承攬下召工之職。假使你想做工的話，便得向這工頭買一個位置，代價大約是一磅十先令，合印幣二十　比。請想，這二十　比雖是小小數目，可是在這些窮斯濫矣的阿三頭上，豈非一筆大款。怎麽辦？只好向工頭惜。唔，借印度阿三的錢，算你倒了霉：有許多上海朋友，也許嘗過這滋味。因此印度工人這區區二十　比的借款，有的弄得終身還不淸楚，因爲每月每盧比平均利息是兩個半安納（每安納合十六分之一　比），這樣算算，長年利息就得百分之一百五十（比之我國「大加一」利息要大到十他倍）。</p>
<p>廠主大半是英法人，像這樣的惡例，英人爲什麽不革除呢？其中自有道理。因爲落得省事而用便宜人工。所以廠家每年紅利可以獲到百分之百，甚至於百分之一百五十。……</p>
<p>然而這些怪狀是不是本題所謂之「度精神」？是否「印度精神」輸迴的神秘性？非也。</p>
<p>據佛家語，世界一切衆生，莫不展韓生死於六道之中，如車輪旋轉，故曰輪迴。六道者即天道·人道·神道·鬼道·畜道。地獄道。其中天道最樂，地獄道最苦。</p>
<p>印度自有國以來，老是在這六道之中，輪迥不已，因其輪迴不已，遂而鍛鍊成了一種印度精神一。这種精神，五千年來，死而冉生，生者復死，一再的輪迥着，可是老滅絕不了。</p>
<p>要明白印度精神是什麼，何以不得滅絕，先得看看他的地理形勢，再得觀察他的曆史和社會，就可明瞭。</p>
<p>展開亞洲地圖，就可看到印度之大，僅次於中國，佔地一百八十餘萬方里。與歐洲相較，可說除了蘇聯以外，全是印度。然而形勢却極其特別，有點像一　置的三角。就地勢上講，北部一帶，就有天設地造的一座屏藩—世界最高的喜馬拉雅山嶺。這座山橫阻一切北來的風雨，有四千五百　里之長，四百到六百餘里之闊，平均高度在二萬英尺左右，而最高峯差不多有三萬英尺，就是美國新型的飛行堡壘，要想越過這座屛障，也有好大困難。</p>
<p>全國約有五分之四的地　是伸到印度洋裹，成一尖角。要說用軍艦來進攻的話，有些不大容易；因其失角的兩邊一帶，都是直削形勢，而且西邊臨海帶，都是石壁；東邊一帶，却是沼澤和森林，况且沿海都有淺灘，大型的輪船在六　英里之外就得趕緊拋錨。難道不能　用淺水輪，橡皮輪，和甚麼水陸兩用之類的坦克車？慢來，就算你能登陸，還有那石壁和沼澤森林的防禦。就算跨過了這些障碍，要我到阿三對打，還得深入發十或百餘英里之內，也許纔能碰到幾個「卑賤人」的孤村，和三兩個托缽僧。打不起來，不是嗎？</p>

<h3>普羅飯店速寫  韋格下層階級的噉飯所　　所謂普羅飯店，就是大衆化飯店的別稱。普羅一詞，係英文普羅列塔利亞的簡寫，如文學上有普羅，小資產階級，與貴族等區別。本埠飯店林立，露天飯攤，不能與高貴的飯店並立，因僭以「普羅」名之。　　大雨傘下的長餐桌　　路過貝禘鏖路，平濟利路，馬浪路一帶，在人行道的邊緣，能見到一列一列的長檯子安放着，無論是大好天氣或雨天，總有一頂大油布傘在那　子的一旁　立着。長　子上零亂地陳有一隻隻發着烏光的盛器，因爲有的是木製的，不能一律說它是　；一隻絕大的筷籠，足能容納幾十雙筷，這些竹筷，巳失去原來的外表，而像上過霉色的厚漆一樣；磁碗殘缺的居多，與荒山的古塔相近似，油水從最高一隻碗循序滴下，長檯的下傾處，姑且稱它爲盆地，就注滿了水；　旁的大鐵錢，正四射着滿鍋飯香，吸引那已覺飢餓的人，一輛空的人力車綏緩過來，車夫正準備暫停營業，飽食一頓特快午餐。同時攤上的小伙子，見有空人力車拉過，會跑上去拉了車桿，强制地招徠生意。這種飯攤的顧客範圍很廣，連薦頭店一裏在等候命運的男女，也相率前往果腹。　　鹹菜·黃荳芽·白飯·　　這樣簡單的飯店裏，居然也有菜單，自然這不能和文瑞印書館所印的相提並論，但班框一具，墨痕數行，倒亦別有風致。其實他們沒有菜單也行，因爲每隻　裹所盛的如鹹菜，豆腐，黃荳芽之類，即已明白吿訴了顧客，而且種類有限，價格一律，老吃客早就肚裏有數。普羅飯店裏的座上客，大都沒有「坐相，有把脚翹在凳子上的，有左手抓背右手執筷的，姿態互異，形狀各別；吃飯時則無一非狼呑虎　，而且速度驚人，送也是米價越貴，窮人飯量越大的明證。　　窮得這樣還尋開心　　浣紗溪畔的西施大約並未呈請專利，以致她的芳名到處爲人製用，湯個西施，荳腐西施……之外，普羅飯店林中，也難免來一個飯攤西施，猜度起來，這是窮極無聊的小六子，小三子之類所給予略有幾分姿色的飯攤女郎的雅號。有時行經普羅飯店，看見三五座上客，正與當爐女厮纏，少女鍋　一舉，作欲下擊的姿勢，口中駡着；「死不要臉的，窮得這樣，還尋什麼開心？」但黃包車夫大多是窮得不堪，缺乏綺思，如遇嬌聲呼車的，一手揩嘴，忙着拉車就跑，生活要緊，也顧不得飯後宜劇烈運動，以及秀色之可餐了。　　他拉車，我坐車　　黃包車夫中也不乏富麗人物，有一次在飯店弄堂樓下吃飯，桌少人擠，並坐者適爲一短衣赤足朋友，吃好惠鈔，我的二元六角，他的却超過我二分之一，起初以爲他是外灘的扛棒，力用得過份，所以飯也吃得過份，萬不料他是黃包車夫。走出門首，見他往黃包車的車桿內一站，從墊子不拿出自來火，開始吸嵌在耳朶縫裏的烟尾，因爲我當門　豫，就向我嚷「先生，拉塊去？」春雨纏綿，道路盡　，不忍糟塌布底棉鞋，就以六角錢成交，飯時並肩而坐，飯後他拉車，我高踞而坐，可見得我輩坐車的雖比拉車的舒服，但他們跑跑普羅飯店的，有時也有豪舉呢</h3>

時珍本草綱目引證曹叔雅的　物志說：「芭蕉結實，其皮赤如火，—此句恐誤—其肉甜如蜜，四五枚可飽人，而滋味常牙齒間，故名甘蕉。」宋人范成大在桂海虞衡志上連它的性質效能也記載出來了：「蕉子，芭蕉極大者，……葉根有實，去皮取肉，軟爛如綠——此綠字亦奇！柿，極甘冷！……土人或以飼小兒，云性凉，去客熱。以梅汁漬，暴乾，按令扁，味甘酸，有微霜，世所謂「芭蕉乾」者是也。……」要按這「芭蕉乾」之字看來，是香蕉又能　乾保藏起來如同人製造桃脯，杏脯，或「柿餅子」一樣；不知道這法子是否流傳到現在，也不知道現在還有人如法泡製的沒有，可惜在上海還沒有口福得一嘗此異味哩！　　明朝吳縣人顧　在所作海槎餘錄上又說：「海南芭蕉，常年開花，結實有二種：一曰板焦」，大而味淡；一曰「佛　蕉」小而味甜；俗呼爲「蕉子」。……」至於福州府志上也說物產中有「象牙蕉」和「佛指蕉」；一種是形容香蕉的顏色，一種是表示香蕉的形狀，名字全是非當俊雅可愛的。」從以上引證的書籍看來，香蕉在古時最普通的名字是「甘蕉」或「蕉子」；　（未完）</p>

<p>春秋力學  周默　　「孔子閑居，子貢入侍，見其面有憂色，子貢不敢問，出告顏回，顏回就援琴而歌，孔子聞之，召顏回入，問曰：爾奚獨樂？顏反問曰：夫子奚獨憂？孔子曰：先言爾志。顏日：吾昔聞夫子曰，樂天知命故不憂，面所以樂也。孔子愀然有間日：有是言哉？汝徒知樂天知命之無憂，未知樂天知命有憂之大也；今若吿其修一身仟窮達，知來去之非，爾之所謂樂天知命之無憂也。　我修詩書，正禮樂，將以治天下遺來世，非但修一身而已；今道不行，無救於治亂，而未知所以革之之方，此樂天知命之所憂；雖然我得之矣，無樂無知，是眞樂眞知，故無所不樂，無所不知，無所不憂，無所不爲，詩書禮樂，何棄之有。顏回拜手曰：回亦得之矣。出吿子貢，子貢茫然，歸家淫思七日，不寢不食，以至骨立。顏回往喩之，及返孔門，絃歌誦書，終身不輟。」　　前面這段掌故，當然距今年遠代湮，可是孔子德配天地道冠古今，這種爲學精神，是不應忽略的。子貢長於貨殲，幸而當年顏回尙未短命死矣；要不然，子貢沒有道番敎訓，將荒廢一生了。也幸而列子上還有這段記載，要不然孔子亂世不廢詩書禮樂的敎訓，還能流傳到今日嗎？　　可貴的求學精神，地無分南北，人無分老幼，還是應該刻苦力學的。　　平劇包銀雖按月計算，但停　一日，即扣除包銀一日。大舞台自新正封鎖迄今，不但跑龍套等活不下去，即小角兒也多另尋出路，正如大東舞廳的大批舞女都向高士滿新仙林發展一樣；昨日啟封後，「三門街」陣容當又重行調整。　　共舞台與王桂鄕的「公事」不能定局，最近還是拉牢了一把「小辮子」，就是七歲紅八歲紅九歲紅等。　　更新舞台編排「大俠甘鳳池」新劇，決定星期六晚上演，由郭玉崑飾甘鳳池，趙松樵飾劉　，小楊月樓飾薛翠花，王俊　飾乾隆帝，劉文魁飾奚淸如。如成績良佳，將續排二本。閒話豆腐  維摩　　市井流行的「孵豆芽」和「吃豆腐」兩句話，終究難登天雅之堂，所謂正人君子之流是很少去引用或考究的；這也難怪，實在豆這樣東西，在一般人目光中看來太卑賤而不値錢了。　　靑菜豆腐連在一起，不問可知要把人的嘴吃得吐淸水，「淡而無味」要是一速供上十天八天作爲主要的菜肴，這種現象未始不會沒有。然而話又得說回來，「咬得菜根」和「吃得豆腐」的人，至少在求生方面，無論從實質或精神上講，總是佔便宜呢。　　廣義的講來，黃豆芽也可以算得菜根，能多吃黃豆芽於身體，於經濟都是有益無損的。至於豆腐，可說是素食主義者的「中心思想」，素菜館中的基本隊伍，顚撲不破，不受任何環境的束縛或改變。　　黃豆芽和豆腐都來自大豆，前者在形體上尙有跡象可尋，後者則面目全非，把兩種東西放在一起，在「音容笑貌」上面決不會聯譜歸宗。小小的一粒黃豆在二孵」一「壓」之間就能造成兩種不同的局面，這且不必細說，更偉大的却是它對於人類的價値，還是來規規矩矩研究「吃豆腐」吧。　　本埠雷士德硏究院敎授李特氏，在他所作的「素食有益　生論」的文章中，對於豆類所製造出來各種食品，硏究其營養價値，推崇備至。一切用科學的分析去解答這些「家常」食品的眞正價價所在。　　黃豆芽好像蝌蚪文，論其地位自應置之篇首。據李氏的硏究，這裏面維他命Ｃ最稱豐富。因之在花旗蜜橘視同珍寶，蕃茄尙未大量登塲之時，這黃豆芽倒是很難得的維他命Ｃ供給者，如能常吃定有裨益。　　在做豆腐之前，第一步要把黃豆磨成豆腐漿，它的營養價値不亞於牛乳。一九三七年國際聯盟在爪哇會議時，對於豆腐漿的功能，說它色白和動物的乳汁差不多，如能和以適量的蛋黃，麥芽糖，和礦鹽等，營養價値更高。即使嬰孩也能哺喂哩。一登龍門，身價十倍，些豆腐漿之謂也。　　凡是黃豆所具有營養成份，豆腐集其大成，並因食譜繁多，在具體而微的過程中，倒是更爲發揚光大。多量的蛋白質石灰質脂肪等在在能增加人們的體力。所惜「豆腐要買肉價鈿」一語平經應騐，目下四毛錢一方豆腐，大約是三英寸乘二英寸見方一英寸高而已。　　滬語駡「買塊豆腐去撞死吧」，要是豆腐眞能堅硬的話，在今日計算道「自殺的成本」恐亦非隨便能下手哩！唐槐秋與亞森羅蘋  林之　　誰都知道亞森羅　是法國著名的俠盜，他不但劫富濟貧，而且風流倜儻，變化無窮，往往側身上流社會裏頭，成為一個漂亮約紳士，所以在法國，羅蘋有紳士强盜之稱。　　法國人的生活是比較浪漫而風趣的，他們會想出種種妙趣橫生的方法來娛樂。唐槐秋二十多歲的時候，正在法國留學練習航空，他曾參加過一次有趣的化裝跳舞會——在這次舞會裹頭，每個參加的紳士都要偷偷的化裝成各種典型的人物，不可以把他的本來面目吿訴別人，等到比賽的時候，就一個一個輪流地請許多小姐們隨便猜測這個本人是誰，如果有某一位小姐猜中時，這位被猜的紳士就耍和這位小姐接一個吻。　　這次唐槐秋化裝了亞森羅蘋來參加舞會，原因是他的許多同學們早就說他的面貌身材酷類羅蘋，他想試一試法國人的眼力如何。等到比賽的時候，果然有一位很漂亮的小姐——她是市長的女兒，一口咬定說：「這位漂亮的亞森羅蘋一定是尼古拉唐假扮的！」原來是唐槐秋在法國的名字叫做尼古拉，被這位小姐一猜而中，於是依照規定，二人親密地接了一個吻，許多愛慕這位市長小姐的法國紳士們，眞是　羨我們這個中國靑年的福氣呵！　　其實呢，亞森羅蘋也並非實有其人，而是出法國名小說家勒白朗氏創造出來的，勒氏最近數日前得病逝世了，亞森羅蘋也就成爲他享名的遺作。　　唐槐秋在法國的時候，也和勒白朗氏有相當的交誼，對於他所創造的羅蘋更有豐富的興趣。這次傳聞勒氏病沒，槐秋深致哀悼，異想天開，發明了一個追悼老友的好方法，他就請托了一位作家蕭林，把勒氏的遺著改編成劇本，由唐氏領導的中國旅行劇團來公演，藉紀念勒白朗。第一部最精采的羅蘋俠盜案就是「紅顏知巳」。　　「紅顏知已」裏，唐槐秋親自扮演劇中假委員陳伯康（就是羅蘋喬裝的），這樣一來，槐秋非但在法國的跳舞會裏假裝過羅　，現在又要在中國的舞台上扮演羅　，對於他的愛好羅蘋，總算是大過其癮。　　聽說關於羅蘋俠盜案的劇本，還要不斷地一本一本產生，並且由「中旅」專利演出，很希望能有良好的成績，不負勒白朗氏畢生心血的結晶。風雨同舟  何家支　　（二）悲與喜　　維城再也沒有閒情逸致，去和道位名醫，這位尊親，聞訊任何一句話，他還是從客廳裏，穿到他母親葉大太太厲夫人房裏。房裏點着明晃晃的保險燈，旁邊還有一枝白蠟，床前站了幾個女客，她們都向維城招呼。維城可沒餘暇去看這是誰這是誰，他竄到床前，對躺在床上的，慘白的，憔悴的母親，喚一聲「媽」，巫峽猿啼似的一聲。　　女客裏，有着不止一個人在喚：「維城回來了，他在喚媽。你睜眼看，是誰在喚你？維城是你的心肝，你的寶貝，你聽到嗎？維城回來了。」維城便坐在床沿上，又是一聲「媽」，同時他伸手去撥動葉大太太焦黑的嘴唇。他的眼淚，跟着了滴了一點下來，滴在他手指上，手指是顫動了。又是陸續在喚：「維城回來了，他在喚你。你沒聽到嗎？」維城又嗚咽着喚「媽」。　　葉大太太先是眼皮在浮動，接着睜眼了，兩個眼珠子，黯淡無光的射在維城臉上。維城道：「媽，我回來了。媽不是爲信給我，說身體好了媽？誰知道媽是怕我惦記，全寫些安慰我的話。媽。」旁邊有人說道：「維城，你媽老是昏昏沉沉的，她怕煩。這一回病了，她是不大肯開口。你看，她對你看着，她心裏已是明白的了。」維城的心，暫時鎭靜正來，才知道說話的，是他的大姑母二姑母；拿洋蠟盤擎在手裏照着維城的臉給葉大太太瞧得淸楚些的，是一個遠親翠珍姊。翠珍沒有說過話，還像和維城沒有招呼過，可是她的眼眶周圍，也紅紅的和維城不相上下。（二〇）游藝雜談河南墜字  澤夫　　墜字爲河南所流行之唱詞。豫人稱弦子爲墜子，而其唱詞係一字墜一字者，故名墜字。普通多混　爲墜子，實非。其淵源由於道情。光緒年間，賣唱者嫌道情腔調單純，乃雜以皮黃，梆子，崑曲，大鼓諸腔，改變而創此體。故所用唱詞，即由以上諸種戲劇改編而來，如「單刀赴會」，「三堂會審」，「寶玉探病」之類，惟均爲叙事而非代言。樂器有弦子，脚梆，醒木，簡板，小　諸種。唱時正詞之前，必先唸詩，引子，及序詞三者。詩爲五言或七言四句，內容隨所唱對象而不同。引子通常爲「四句閑言道罷，聽咱慢慢道來。」序詞則大略述墜字之內容。正詞有七言十言之分，亦有三言五言者，謂之三字聯五字嵌，雜於七言十言之中。昔時僅一人自拉自唱，謂之單墜字；近盛行兩人對唱，且另有司樂相佐，謂之雙墜字。業此者大抵多爲妙齡女子，妖嬈逗人，故河南人有「聽戲不如聽墜字」之說云。</p>

<h3>The Imminent Burmese War, Influencing the Entire Pacific Situation: Australian Army Ordered to Adopt Offensive Strategy; Japanese Troops Continue Landing in New Guinea</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 11th (Reuters) – “Too little, too late.” These four words can summarize the tragic history of the fall of Rangoon. Too few personnel, too few supplies, and too few fighter and bomber planes, coupled with inadequate defenses and pressure from a strong enemy, made it impossible to cope. By the time reinforcements arrived, it was too late. The "too late" refers to failing to hold the Qian River, then failing to hold the Baolin River area, and ultimately failing to save Rangoon. The battle of Rangoon has now ended, and the battle of Burma is unfolding. The victory or defeat in this battle is tied to the national fortunes of India and China, and is closely related to the overall situation of the Pacific War.</p>

Jones asked again whether the government could announce when the Prime Minister can fulfill his promise so that they can hold a debate on the entire Malaya and Singapore issue. Attlee replied that this would depend on the availability of information. Before we have information, it is not appropriate to conduct an investigation or debate.</p>
<h3>British Daily War Expenditure Requires Over 14 Million Pounds; Bill for Issuing Public Bonds Passed by the House of Commons</h3>
<p>London, 10th (Reuters) – Chancellor of the Exchequer Wood spoke in the House of Commons today, requesting the House to pass a supplementary war expenditure of 250 million pounds. It is said that in the past six weeks, Britain's daily war expenditure has reached 14.5 million pounds, and in the coming weeks, it will increase even more. The war expenditure previously approved is insufficient, and it is necessary to allocate another 250 million pounds. In 1918, Britain passed a war expenditure totaling 2.5 billion pounds. The war ended thereafter, and it was not fully used. After the last World War, Britain's expenditure increased greatly, and our needs continued to increase. Two years ago, Britain's daily expenditure was 5 million pounds, of which 4 million pounds was for military expenditure. Wood continued to discuss the needs for the coming year, requesting Parliament to vote to allocate 1 billion pounds to cover the expenses for the first few months of the new fiscal year. This amount is determined according to the current rate of expenditure and will be exhausted around mid-June. The primary task is to use funds for war expenditure properly. All consumption should be economical, and everything should be based on the country's needs. Any waste must be eliminated. (The crowd cheered) Any government agency or personnel should avoid wasting national funds and abusing materials and manpower that can be used for war. The Chancellor of the Exchequer continued to explain the importance of national savings. It is said that the national savings movement can make the people clearly understand their responsibilities, avoid waste, and reduce consumption to a minimum. This is the most important task, and its significance has become clear with the progress of the war. The key to our financial success or failure lies in this.</p>
<p>London, 10th (Reuters) – The House of Commons unanimously passed two proposals: the continued issuance of 250 million pounds in public bonds for the current fiscal year and the first installment of 1 billion pounds for the new fiscal year starting April 1st. A short debate was held in the House of Commons beforehand. Financial Secretary Crook stated at the end of the debate that the House of Commons spent a total of 174.2 million pounds during the last World War. In this war, if the two proposals of today are included, the expenditure has exceeded the last World War by 300 million pounds. The current interest rate on public bonds is 2.5% or 3%, while it was 5% or 6% during the last World War, so the cost of borrowing is extremely low. The value of this "Warship Week" lies not in raising more public bonds, but in promoting the meaning of savings. "Savings" should be the national motto. The House of Commons then unanimously passed the government's two requests.</p>
<h3>About the Island of Ceylon and its Creation Myth</h3>
<p>As naval warfare continues to spread, the ancient Buddhist kingdom of Ceylon is also threatened by the flames of war.</p>
<p>Ceylon is a sacred site for Buddhism, and is appropriately located at the traffic intersection of the Indian Ocean, so it has been famous in the world since very early times. In the first century AD, Pliny the Elder, who sacrificed himself to Mount Vesuvius and Pompeii, mentioned the place in his "Natural History," naming it Taprobane; The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, also from the same time, called it Palaesimunden (meaning Buddhist Dharma.) In addition, there were other names such as Salika, and Sihalaka, all referring to this island. Starting in the fourth century, the name Serendivi appeared, which is the origin of the later name Ceylon. In China, knowledge about Ceylon also appeared very early. During the Wu Dynasty of Sun Quan, Kang Tai was sent as an envoy to Funan (present-day eastern part of Thailand), and upon his return, he wrote "Funan Customs," in which he mentioned "Sidiaozhou," which according to French scholar Paul Pelliot, is a transliteration of the ancient Ceylon name Sihadiva. This view is probably correct. However, the most common name for Ceylon in ancient China was Shizi Guo (or Lion Country). This name first appeared in Faxian's "Record of Buddhist Kingdoms" from the Jin Dynasty, and Xuanzang's "Records of the Western Regions" named it Senggaluo Guo or Wuyou Guo. The latter name is because King Ashoka promoted Buddhism in this place after Sakyamuni's death. As for Senggaluo Guo and Shizi (Lion) Guo, both are translations of Sihalaka, one being a transliteration and the other being a translation of the meaning.</p>
<p>Regarding the origin of the name Shizi (Lion) Guo, the Great Tang Records on the Western Regions has an interesting myth. It is said that in ancient times, a king from South India hired a princess to marry into a neighboring country. On the way, they suddenly encountered a lion, and the escorting officers and soldiers all fled, abandoning the princess in the carriage. As a result, the princess was taken by the lion into the deep mountains, where she became husband and wife, and they had a son and a daughter. When the son grew up, he was extremely brave and strong. As his intelligence gradually developed, he asked his mother about the reason for his father being a lion and his mother a human. His mother told him the whole story, and then persuaded him to return to his country when his lion father was away. At that time, the king's ancestral sacrifices had been cut off, and he had no choice but to go to the homes of the people and receive supplies to live. When the lion returned to its lair and did not see its wife and children, it was enraged and searched for them in the villages, wreaking havoc. The king could not bear the disturbance and offered a large reward for a brave warrior who could eliminate the lion. The son, driven by hunger and cold, went to apply, ignoring his mother's dissuasion, and went straight to the mountains and forests to find his lion father. When the lion saw its son coming, its anger disappeared immediately, and it became tame and loving. The son stabbed the lion in the abdomen with a knife and killed it. The king was amazed and asked about the reason. He thought that the son had contributed to eliminating the barbarians but had committed the great crime of killing his father. He then rewarded the mother heavily and kept her in the country, and prepared a large ship to exile the children. The son sailed to Ceylon, saw that the local area was rich in treasures, and stayed on the island. Later, his descendants multiplied. Because their ancestor had eliminated the lion, they named the country after the lion. This type of legend often exists among various primitive peoples, such as the Khitan people's connection to dogs and the Turks' connection to wolves. According to modern folklore knowledge, the so-called lions, dogs, and wolves are probably just the totems of those ethnic groups in ancient times.</p>
<p>It is said that Sakyamuni once transformed into Senggaluo and was born on the island, and later passed away there. Therefore, there are many stories about the island of Ceylon in Buddhist books, such as Senggaluo subduing the Rakshasa woman, which is one of the famous stories. As a result, Buddhist relics are found everywhere on the island. For example, the huge Buddhist hall and pagoda of Abhayagiri and the Buddha's footprint on Adam's Peak are all famous historical sites. Although Islam and Brahmanism each have their own explanations for that footprint, Faxian's "Record of Travels" already attributed it to the Buddha. In various Chinese records, it is generally said to be a Buddhist footprint. Only Yingya Shenglan advocates the Islamic legend of Adam's footprint because the author Ma Huan was a Muslim.</p>
<p>Ceylon has been famous for its production of pearls and gemstones since ancient times, so it is also called Baozhu (Ratnadvipa) in Buddhist scriptures. Will this "lion descendant" jewel country be able to escape the baptism of artillery fire this time? I am afraid that only future history can answer this question.</p>

<h3>Australia's Material Resources</h3>
<p>Since the unconditional surrender of the Dutch East Indies, the Australian continent has been potentially exposed to a Japanese invasion. The Australian Federal Government has authorized military authorities to destroy roads, highways, railway lines, canals, airfields, docks, and embankments when necessary. This is the so-called "scorched earth strategy." The Allies have placed very high expectations on Australia's human and material resources in this war. Its resources, such as sugar cane, timber, sheep, cattle, fruits, wheat, cheese, and vast amounts of minerals, are constantly supplied to its mother country, Britain, over long distances. "Top image": Australian timber, available everywhere, especially in Western Australia, where the largest trees can grow to 280 feet tall and 24 feet in diameter. "Bottom image": Most of Europe's wool and mutton come from Australia's 140 million sheep. Some sheep can be sheared three times a year. The sheep in this image are just the smallest of the smallest group.</p>

<h3>Germany Greatly Strengthens Defenses in Northern Europe to Prevent British and American Supplies from Reaching Soviet Union; Large-Scale Naval Battle Brewing in North Sea</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Swedish Capital, 11th (Havas) – The Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter's Berlin dispatch states that the main mission of the German battleships "Tirpitz," "Scharnhorst," and "Gneisenau" is to prevent British and American escorted merchant fleets from reaching the Soviet port of Murmansk. The German side in charge anticipates that a naval battle is about to occur in the North Sea. It is known that the defenses of the Norwegian naval base of Trondheim have been greatly strengthened in recent months, so it can be known that a large-scale naval battle is about to occur in the North Sea. At the same time, German warships will also prevent the Allied forces from invading Norway. German newspapers have repeatedly mentioned the possibility of Norway being invaded.</p>
<h3>Soviet Forces Attack on All Fronts; Italian Aircraft Participate in Combat on the Eastern Front</h3>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Kaito) – According to authoritative sources, fierce fighting is taking place in the Donets River Basin, around Taganrog, and around Stalino.</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Kaito) – The German High Command announced last night that, under the cover of a large number of aircraft and tanks, the enemy attacked the positions of a certain German division between Lake Ladoga and Volkhov on Monday morning. At one point, the Soviet army launched as many as five attacks, all of which were repelled. Although the Soviet army was able to break through the German line in some places, they were driven out after a German counterattack. The situation in Crimea was relatively quiet on Monday morning, but in the afternoon, the Soviet army attacked the German positions in Sevastopol, but was repelled by the fierce artillery fire of the German infantry artillery. The Soviet counterattack in the Kerch region was also repelled. By evening, there was an artillery battle, and many Soviet artillery positions were destroyed. German aircraft continued to heavily bomb enemy port facilities and positions in Crimea on Monday, with considerable success.</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Kaito) – Military experts, supplementing yesterday's German military report, stated that the German army's deep penetration into the enemy's echeloned positions in the middle section of the Eastern Front is a remarkable achievement. These positions are not fixed straight-line positions, but countless irregular fortresses built according to the terrain, so it is very difficult for the enemy to attack, because there is always the danger of being attacked from the side.</p>
<p>Rome, 11th (Kaito) – A communiqué issued here last night stated that Italian air force personnel have been very active on the Eastern Front recently. On Monday, a squadron of Italian fighters encountered a large number of Soviet aircraft. Although the numbers were greatly unequal, they shot down three Soviet aircraft.</p>

<h3>French Misconduct Case: Riom Trial</h3>
<p>Riom, 10th (Havas) – The Riom Supreme Court continued its session today. Former Prime Minister Blum of the Popular Front Cabinet spoke, stating that during his term as Prime Minister, French industrial production had in fact increased sharply. The labor legislation formulated by the government was truly "a manifestation of public opinion" and did not hinder national defense. He was only fulfilling his duty as Prime Minister of a republic. It is noted that during the general election held in April 1936, strikes broke out in many places throughout the country, and hundreds of factories were occupied by workers. This shows that the wave of strikes occurred before he took office. "At that time, every citizen, including employers, demanded the immediate implementation of social legislation, and employers did not ask the government to drive the workers occupying the factories out of the factories, nor did the representatives of the employers ask me to use force. Moreover, if I had suppressed the workers by force at that time, a civil war would have inevitably occurred, and the result would have affected military production and made the people favor foreign warfare. Furthermore, in 1936, unemployed workers were all over the country, and most French factories could not allow workers to work more than forty hours a week. In addition, military orders had been handed over to private factories by the former Prime Minister. The most important of these was the order for the Hotchkiss machine guns, which had already been handed over to private factories before I took office. As for the situation of political parties at that time, I suggested to the opposition parties to form a 'nationally united' government composed of all parties and factions. At that time, the international situation was becoming increasingly tense, and the Popular Front government also worked hard to step up military production and placed the free economy under state control, controlled foreign exchange, and increased the working hours of factories manufacturing military equipment from forty hours to forty-five hours per week. It should be noted that before we took these measures, the previous cabinet had even watched some factories related to military production working less than forty hours. At the same time, employers, in view of the large number of unemployed workers, also mostly demanded that working hours not be extended. It can be seen that it was not easy for the Popular Front cabinet to increase working hours to forty-five hours. In short, the labor legislation of 1936 was enough to encourage workers to increase production efficiency. Moreover, in 1936, there were three cabinets in succession, namely Blum, Xu Dang, and the third Dala cabinet. Today, I and Dala are being tried here, but it is a pity that Xu Dang is enjoying himself overseas. In fact, during his tenure, the development of the international situation was very important," he said. Blum finally said that he would also submit a lengthy defense to the court tomorrow.</p>
<h3>British Planes Attack Germany</h3>

<h3>Germany and Bulgaria Sign Economic Agreement</h3>
<p>Sofia, 11th (Haitong News Agency) – Bulgaria and Germany have signed an agreement in which Bulgaria will supply Germany and German-occupied areas with 42 million kilograms of tobacco worth 40 million levs. A clause in the agreement expands Bulgaria's 1941-1942 tobacco harvest.</p>
<h3>Post-War France Implements Rural Revitalization Plan</h3>
<p>Havas World News Agency, Vichy Dispatch – Regarding the agricultural situation in post-war France, Marshal Pétain delivered a speech on June 6 of this year, outlining its main points. According to the report, although millions of French farmers were captured on the battlefield, the area of cultivated land nationwide has now increased by one million acres compared to before the war. However, agricultural production cannot meet normal needs, which is still one of the main factors constituting France's poverty today. The phenomenon of insufficient production should not be attributed to the defeat in the war, but rather to the inevitable consequence of the war itself. The result of this war, in addition to ravaging sixty provinces across the country, requires our country to pay materials in accordance with the armistice agreement. In addition, raw materials are extremely scarce, and farmers often have farming machines but lack fuel, and there is a shortage of fertilizer and harvesting equipment, as well as a lack of seeds and livestock feed. In order to remedy the situation, the government has taken various steps to establish "Farmers' Associations" to protect agriculture and rural families, and to prevent their families from being separated. Stabilizing rural life is an urgent task to improve agriculture. The rural revitalization plan currently underway requires a total of 300 billion francs. Since the establishment of the French-German armistice agreement, farmers whose cultivated land has been damaged by the war have been given advances by the government to enable them to continue operating. This advance is limited to 200 billion francs. As for relief for the unemployed, there are many outlets in rural areas. Four thousand unemployed youths have found work in rural areas, and more than 20,000 acres of land have been irrigated. 25,000 acres each of newly reclaimed wasteland and gardens have been opened up. In addition, afforestation and improvement of grazing areas are also being carried out. The government has allocated 150 billion francs for the expenses of these projects. The entire plan will take ten years to complete.</p>

<h3>The Mystery of Reincarnation in the "Indian Spirit"</h3>
<p>Anyone who sees the "Indian Certificate" of a Red-headed Ah San will feel a bit of mystery. A face full of curly hair and a beard, thorny rain-like thick eyebrows drooping over round eyes, a large and oily nose, covered with reddish-black granules and warts, and the nostrils are stuffed tightly with two tufts of hair, making it truly unknown how they breathe.</p>
<p>Mystery? Where exactly is the mystery of Ah San? The first of course is the large pile that is coiled on the head all year round, and the second is that pair of drowsy eyes that seem to be dreaming a demonic dream; they are like two dark caves, like unfathomable abysses; the face cannot be seen, it is all hair, a messy mess of hair, which of course makes people feel a bit of awkwardness and mystery; and then there is the occasional murmuring-like moans or dream-talk—said to be chanting Hindu scriptures.</p>
<p>However, these are not enough to represent the mystery of the "Indian spirit".</p>
<p>For example, referring to John Gunther's "Inside Asia", the mysterious things mentioned in India, such as the lock is turned backwards to open it, the railway has three tracks, the hotel does not install doors, nor does it use bells, the person's name, the name is placed first, the surname is second, and everyone's name and surname must put the clan name on it as a public surname; the number of tonnage above one hundred is two digits at a time, such as the writing method of ten million is "1, 00, 00, 000" called one lakh, and so on.</p>
<p>These, in our Chinese view, are not mysterious; there is no need to be surprised or to treat everything as supernatural. In addition, it is rumored that the two hands of Indian Ah San must be assigned different tasks. The right hand is very noble, only the right hand can grab rice and stretch it into the mouth, and the left hand can only do some piecemeal services after going to the toilet, such as using toilet paper. The level of distinction is very strict, even in military situations as urgent as fire, at the moment of imminent disaster, the functions of these two hands cannot be confused.</p>
<p>This is a small matter, nothing surprising. But looking at the big picture, there are indeed some confusing places. For example, anyone who has read some books on the Indian problem will say that India is a poor country, and beggars all over the country, including monks, are everywhere; however, in the 562 native kingdoms that have not been invaded by the British, each native king is so rich that they do not know how much gold, jewelry, and other properties they have. As for the characters, it is easy to count several famous figures, male poet Tagore, female poet Pandita Ramabai, Nehru in the political circles, Jinnah, the leader of Islam, and Mahatma Gandhi weighing 112 pounds. For someone like Gandhi, in the eyes of the British government and public, they just can't do anything about him. He would go to jail himself and refuse to come out. Then he refused to eat and starved himself, starving for ten or twenty days, without caring at all. The British could only succumb to this 73-year-old thin old man and even call him "the contemporary Savior Jesus".</p>
<p>There are some strange things. In the forests by the Ganges River, if we are willing to take a trip, we can see many hermits practicing, meditating on the ground, in thorn bushes, or on branches. They sit all year round and refuse to get up. It is said—perhaps it is a tall tale—that some hermits have been sitting for too many years, and their toenails and fingernails grow like withered vines wrapped around their bodies, knotted together with grass vines, and cannot be pulled apart. Some also have hair and beards that grow tangled with tree branches.</p>
<p>When it comes to religion, there may be some incomprehensible mysteries. There are countless types. Worshipping cows, rats, monkeys, crows, each according to their own kind, is a religion. However, in general, there are only two major religions: Hinduism and Islam. What is considered mysterious is that people of these two religions are often in antagonistic positions with deep-seated animosity. Believers in Hinduism account for 66% of the country, about 239 million people, while Islam only has 77 million, but because Muslims are mostly soldiers and are inherently fierce, conflicts between these two religions are inevitable and affect politics. The country is generally unable to settle down year after year.</p>
<p>One thing that the two religions have in common is that they do not associate with the "lowly" Dravidians. Not only do they not associate, but if the Dravidians are unable to avoid it, and step on the shadows of people of the two religions, or their shadows pass over the bodies of people of the two religions, then their followers will be considered unlucky, and they must solemnly perform a ritual chanting scriptures to remove the bad luck.</p>
<p>There are also some strange things about industry and agriculture. 66% of the country's population is engaged in agriculture, but the production of rice and wheat is always not enough. Fortunately, tea and cotton occupy a very high agricultural production index. The north of the country is a landlord-tenant system, while the south is small peasant owners, farming and eating for themselves; this is not particularly special, but the difference is that the situation of tenants is a bit different from that in our country. The name is tenant, but they are actually just hired workers, and the wages of the hired workers are so small that it is hard to believe. Each season, each day, each worker only gets one dime of silver. However, it is still higher than the wages of factory workers by one-fifth, because factory workers only earn eight cents of silver a day after working for more than ten hours. Isn't it too little? A miner who sells his life, if he gets five dollars a week, that is considered great. Therefore, the British say that in the world, the labor is cheap, and even China is considered too cheap to get any cheaper. But India insists on being so cheap that it is not worth mentioning, isn't it strange?</p>
<p>The reason may be because Indian industry is too backward: there are only two industries in the country, textiles (mostly handmade) and a little steel manufacturing. However, although workers only account for one-tenth of the country's population, the number has reached as many as 35 million. The most peculiar point is that a famous factory has a general foreman who contracts the job of recruiting workers from the factory owner. If you want to work, you have to buy a position from the foreman, the price of which is about one pound ten shillings, equivalent to 20 rupees. Please think, although these 20 rupees are a small amount, isn't it a large sum of money for these poor Ah Sans? What to do? You have to beg the foreman to lend you money. Oh, borrowing money from Indian Ah San is bad luck: many friends in Shanghai may have tasted this taste. Therefore, some Indian workers can't clear the small loan of 20 rupees in their entire lives, because the average interest rate per rupee per month is two and a half annas (each anna is one-sixteenth of a rupee). Calculating like this, the annual interest rate will be 150% (ten times larger than the "add one" interest rate in our country).</p>
<p>Most of the factory owners are British and French. Why don't the British eliminate such bad practices? There is a reason for this. Because it is easier to save trouble and use cheap labor. Therefore, factories can get an annual dividend of 100%, or even 150%.…</p>
<p>However, are these strange situations the "Indian spirit" referred to in this topic? Is it the mystery of reincarnation in the "Indian spirit"? No.</p>
<p>According to Buddhist terms, all living beings in the world are subject to birth and death in the six realms, like the rotation of a wheel, so it is called reincarnation. The six realms are the realm of heaven, the realm of humans, the realm of gods, the realm of ghosts, the realm of animals, and the realm of hell. Among them, the realm of heaven is the happiest, and the realm of hell is the most painful.</p>
<p>Since its inception, India has always been in these six realms, constantly reincarnating. Because of its constant reincarnation, it has forged a kind of Indian spirit. This spirit has been dying and reborn for five thousand years, with the living dying again, reincarnating again and again, but it can never be extinguished.</p>
<p>To understand what the Indian spirit is and why it cannot be extinguished, you must first look at its geographical situation, and then observe its history and society, and you can understand.</p>
<p>Unfolding the map of Asia, you can see that India is second only to China in size, covering more than 1.8 million square miles. Compared with Europe, it can be said that except for the Soviet Union, it is all India. However, the situation is very special, a bit like an inverted triangle. In terms of terrain, the northern part has a naturally created screen—the world's highest Himalayan mountains. This mountain blocks all northerly winds and rains, with a length of 4,500 miles, a width of 400 to more than 600 miles, an average height of about 20,000 feet, and the highest peak is almost 30,000 feet. Even the new type of Flying Fortress in the United States has great difficulty in crossing this barrier.</p>
<p>About four-fifths of the country's land extends into the Indian Ocean, forming a sharp angle. If you want to use warships to attack, it is not easy; because the sides of the lost angle are all straight-cut shapes, and the west side is adjacent to the sea and is all stone cliffs; the east side is swamps and forests, and there are shoals along the coast, and large ships have to anchor quickly six miles away. Can't you use shallow-water wheels, rubber wheels, and amphibious tanks? Wait a minute, even if you can land, there are still the stone walls and swamp forests for defense. Even if you overcome these obstacles, if you want me to fight Ah San, you have to go deep within ten or hundreds of miles before you may encounter a few isolated villages of "lowly people" and three or two monks. Can't fight, right?</p>

<h3>Borrowing Ships to Dredge Silt at the Confluence of the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>The浚沛局, in order to prevent the accumulation of silt in the Huangpu River, which caused flooding during the continuous spring rains in April, has dredged the Huangpu River and its two confluences with Suzhou Creek and Xujiahui Hong. The dredging work has been going on for a long time. The 浚浦局 recently borrowed a ship from a certain company in Hong Kong to strengthen its dredging fleet. To date, there are a total of three main dredgers and several auxiliary ships that are constantly active. Because a large amount of silt has accumulated in the Huangpu River from the mouth of the Yangtze River to the downstream, if one section is not dredged, then the dredging work elsewhere will be in vain. The dredging of Xujiahui Hong has a significant impact on reducing flooding in the western district. Before the situation in Shanghai changed, the 浚浦局 paid special attention to the dredging of Xujiahui Hong and Suzhou Creek, in order to jointly form the main silt gathering area at the various confluences along the Huangpu River.</p>
<h3>Garbage Cans Should Be Tightly Covered; Sanitary Regulations of the French Concession Will Be Implemented Strictly</h3>
<p>In order to avoid rats serving as a medium for infectious diseases, the French Concession Public Works Bureau hopes that residents in the concession will cooperate with the French Public Works Bureau's rat extermination methods. Therefore, all regulations regarding garbage removal in the sanitary regulations will be strictly implemented. In particular, residents must not ignore the regulation prohibiting the dumping of garbage on the roads. According to the regulations, "Garbage cans should always be kept clean, tightly covered with a lid that is appropriate in size to prevent the intrusion of rats and the breeding of flies, and should be washed frequently with plenty of water and disinfected with quicklime. When the Public Works Bureau sends people to collect garbage, the garbage cans should be sent to the roadside by their owners. If negligence is allowed, resulting in scavengers scattering garbage on the roads, the owners will be responsible. Health inspectors and officers of the French Concession Police Department have all received instructions to strictly enforce the above-mentioned methods.</p>
<h3>Pharmacy Apprentice Steals Medicine after Suspension</h3>
<p>Tong Shuen, an apprentice at the Wanguo Pharmacy on Fuzhou Road, was suspended by the pharmacy's 常局 due to poor conduct. Recently, Tong stole the pharmacy's 印章 and fraudulently obtained several dozen boxes of 活立生 from the Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory. After being discovered, Ren Fengwu, a Chinese detective from the Central Police Department, arrested Tong. Tong confessed that he had stolen ten 打 of 活立生, worth about 8,000 元, while working at the pharmacy, and sold them cheaply to Xu Zhimin, the owner of the Dafeng Western Medicine Store at No. 2, Lane 60, Baike Road. Xu was subsequently apprehended. The management of Wanguo Pharmacy was negligent. 童's theft was discovered only after 童 confessed. The case has now been concluded, and Tong has been sentenced to six months in prison. Although Xu is suspected of serious involvement, he was found not guilty due to 童's protection and failure to prove intentional conduct.</p>
<h3>A Quick Sketch of Proletarian Restaurants</h3>
<p>The Wretched's Eating Place</p>
<p>The so-called proletarian restaurant is simply another name for a popular restaurant. The word "proletarian" is an abbreviation of the English word "proletariat," just as in literature there are distinctions between proletariat, petty bourgeoisie, and aristocracy. In this city, restaurants stand in great numbers, but open-air food stalls cannot be compared with the grand restaurants, hence the use of the name "proletarian."</p>
<p>Long Tables Under Big Umbrellas</p>
<p>Walking along roads such as the Avenue Petain, Route Pellesier, and Route Massenet, one can see rows of long tables set up at the edge of the sidewalk. Whether the weather is good or rainy, there is always a large oilcloth umbrella standing beside the tables. On the long tables, there are disorderly rows of dark, gleaming containers. Because some are wooden, it is not correct to call them all something specific; a huge chopstick holder, capable of holding dozens of pairs of chopsticks. These bamboo chopsticks have lost their original appearance and look as if they have been coated with a thick layer of mold-colored lacquer. Most of the porcelain bowls are chipped, resembling ancient pagodas on desolate mountains. Oil and water drip down from the highest bowl, and the downward-sloping area of the long table, which we might call a basin, is filled with water. Next to it, a large iron pot sends out a strong aroma of rice, attracting those who are already hungry. An empty rickshaw slowly approaches, the driver preparing to take a break and enjoy a quick lunch. At the same time, the young man at the stall, seeing an empty rickshaw passing by, will run up and grab the shafts, forcefully soliciting business. The customer base of these food stalls is very broad, even including men and women waiting for their fate at labor broker shops, who all flock to them to fill their bellies.</p>
<p>Pickled Vegetables, Yellow Soybeans, White Rice</p>
<p>In such a simple restaurant, there is actually a menu, though of course, it cannot be compared with those printed by the Wenrui Printing House. However, a wooden frame with a few lines of ink has its own unique charm. In fact, they don't even need a menu, because the contents of each container, such as pickled vegetables, tofu, and yellow soybeans, clearly inform the customers, and the variety is limited and the price is uniform, so regular customers already know what to expect. Most of the patrons in a proletarian restaurant do not "sit properly." Some put their feet up on the bench, others scratch their backs with their left hand while holding chopsticks in their right. Their postures vary greatly, and their shapes are distinct. When eating, they all devour their food like wolves, and their speed is astonishing, which is clear evidence that the more expensive rice becomes, the more the poor eat.</p>
<p>So Poor, Yet Still Seeking Fun</p>
<p>The Xi Shi of Huansha Creek probably did not apply for a patent, so her beautiful name is used everywhere. In addition to soup Xi Shi and tofu Xi Shi, the proletarian restaurants are also bound to have a food stall Xi Shi. It is guessed that this is an elegant nickname given by poor and bored youths to a food stall girl with some beauty. Sometimes, when passing by a proletarian restaurant, one sees three or five patrons teasing the girl behind the stove. The girl raises her spatula as if to strike, shouting, "Shameless! So poor, yet still seeking fun?" However, most rickshaw pullers are desperately poor and lack amorous thoughts. If they encounter a beautiful woman calling for a rickshaw, they wipe their mouths and rush to pull the rickshaw. Making a living is the priority, and they cannot afford to worry about the suitability of strenuous exercise after a meal or the appeal of feminine charm.</p>
<p>He Pulls the Rickshaw, I Sit in It</p>
<p>There are also wealthy people among the rickshaw pullers. Once, while eating downstairs in a restaurant alley, there were few tables and many people crowded together. My neighbor was a barefoot friend in short clothes. After eating, my bill was two dollars and sixty cents, but his exceeded mine by one-half. At first, I thought he was a dockworker from the Bund who exerted himself too much, so he ate too much. Unexpectedly, he was a rickshaw puller. Walking out the door, I saw him stand between the shafts of a rickshaw, take a flint from under the cushion, and start smoking a cigarette butt stuck in his ear. Because I hesitated at the door, he shouted at me, "Sir, want a ride?" The spring rain was incessant, and the roads were muddy. Not wanting to ruin my cloth-soled cotton shoes, I agreed to six cents. We sat shoulder to shoulder while eating, and afterward, he pulled the rickshaw while I sat high up. It can be seen that although those of us who ride in rickshaws are more comfortable than those who pull them, even those who frequent proletarian restaurants sometimes have extravagant moments.</p>

<h3>Bold Robbers Attempt to Plunder a Westerner's Residence; Scheme Discovered, Arrests Made</h3>
<p>Thirty-two-year-old Ji Shilin, a notorious robber residing at No. 8, Lane 614, Route Tenant de la Tour, French Concession, conspired with his accomplices Wang Zhiyi and He Sanliu on the night before last at No. 49, Huabei Apartments, Route Massenet, to rob the property of Lithuanian resident Li Namen at Room C, No. 255, Haig Road Apartments. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Li, armed with a four-inch live-ammunition handgun, along with Wang and He, proceeded to the location. As they were about to conduct the robbery, due to inadequate confinement, a Chinese servant named Lu San managed to slip out of the room and loudly called out for thieves. Wang and He, realizing the situation was unfavorable, immediately fled. Ji was unable to escape in time and was apprehended by the apartment's concierge. Subsequently, Chinese Detective Zhang Hongkui and French Constable No. 179 arrested Li and took him to the police station, confiscating the handgun. They are currently being detained pending investigation.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Cash Prices Surge in Afternoon Trade, Reaching Around 19,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash market was sluggish, but as trading resumed, prices initially rose before briefly declining, ultimately rebounding as the 17,000 yuan mark was breached. This recovery was largely due to the return of Japanese military notes to the six-yuan level, prompting large-scale bullish traders to re-emerge. Market sentiment remained strong across the board. Starting in the morning, each tael (ten liang) was driven up in the silver shops, rising 150 yuan from the opening price of 17,600 yuan. The price continued to climb to 17,800 yuan, with the Tongkang, Yongsheng, and Da Yong silver firms, along with Tianjin traders, actively selling. As money changers competed to sell, the price gradually declined by 1,000 yuan, falling below 17,000 yuan, reaching a low of 16,800 yuan. The Sheng Da Yong firm stepped in, and limit-order buyers flooded the market, quickly pushing prices back above 17,000 yuan. The rise in military notes further strengthened confidence. Xieji, Chengji, Datong Securities, and retail investors collectively returned to the market, and sellers hesitated. The bullish momentum continued into noon, pushing prices up to 17,700 yuan. The closing price was 17,600 yuan, a further increase of 150 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous afternoon, and 600 yuan higher than the after-hours price, representing a difference of 1,000 yuan on the day. Trading volume was not strong. In the afternoon, military notes soared, rising to around 19,000 yuan amidst heavy buying. Today is Arbor Day and a holiday. Silver shops, including Da Xin Tonghang, uniformly raised the price of gold ornaments by 50 yuan per tael to 1,800 yuan. Soon after, the price increased to 1,850 yuan, then to 2,000 yuan in the afternoon. (Purchase price reduced by 200 yuan.) Silver was exchanged at a premium of 150 yuan, and the rate was 18 yuan. Black market rates rose to 16 yuan. Silver coins rose to nine yuan each.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the interest rate for overnight loans among the money changers remained at two percent. Discounts and cash rates for remittances and checks remained the same.</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign exchange rates saw gains for the British and American gold pounds, rising by five yuan each, to 400 yuan and 405 yuan respectively. American dollars rose to 19 yuan, Hong Kong dollars were at three yuan, with large notes reduced by five fen. Military notes rose to 6.60 yuan.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Show Positive Sentiment, Not Diminished from the Past</h3>
<p>The government bond market continued its strong upward trend yesterday, reversing the previous days of sluggishness and significant declines. Absorption by various trading groups continued actively, with some previous sellers returning as buyers. Firms such as Da Zhongjinwei and Tongkang Xiekang were particularly active in covering positions, and Jiufeng Hefeng showed strong buying interest, creating a very positive atmosphere. As financial changes occurred and a peaceful atmosphere returned, even though firms such as Shunli, Dechang, Tongyi, Lianhe, and Hu Heji sold large amounts, they were promptly absorbed by buyers, leading to a strong market advance. The positive sentiment was undiminished from the past, suggesting that the market is unlikely to decline in the near term. The result was a further increase of nine jiao to 2.8 yuan, with a trading volume of over one million yuan. A summary table follows.</p>
<p>The stock market remained stable, with a total trading volume of 16,500 shares. Jardine Matheson Textiles rose from 25.5 yuan to 25.75 yuan, China Textiles at 10.35 yuan, Jardine Brewery retreated to six yuan before recovering to 6.15 yuan, Asia Navigation at 7.9 yuan and eight yuan, Ken Zhilong at 25 yuan, Ye Guang at 10.23 yuan, British Union rose from 20 yuan to 20.05 yuan, Steel at 13.2 yuan and 13 yuan, Paper at 6.35 yuan, Tramways at 39 yuan and 39.25 yuan, Shanghai Wool at 6.45 yuan, and Garindo at 0.88 yuan.

<h3>Cotton Yarn Market Bounces Back After Initial Dip</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market initially rose and then fell, but ultimately ended higher. This was due to a unified increase in the price of Japanese yarn and cloth, which boosted market sentiment and buying interest. The opening price for 20-count Bianma Factory yarn was 3,020 yuan, and it quickly rose to 3,070 yuan. At this time, speculative traders actively pressured the market, driving it down to 2,950 yuan. As the price dropped, buyers returned, pushing it back above the 3,000 yuan mark. However, short sellers remained active, pushing it back down to 2,900 yuan. As soon as the low price appeared, buyers with ample capital aggressively purchased, and the market quickly turned upwards, rising to 3,030 yuan at the close. 42-count Lanfeng closed at 6,850 yuan, fluctuating between 6,710 yuan and 6,650 yuan. 60-count Niutou was at 12,350 yuan, 60-count Caiqiu was at 14,600 yuan, 40-count Riguang was at 6,100 yuan, 32-count Xiantao was at 5,450 yuan, 20-count Yueqin was at 3,670 yuan, 20-count Lanfeng was between 3,750 yuan and 3,900 yuan, 20-count Shuangdiqiu was at 3,280 yuan, 18-count Zhi Nv was at 3,200 yuan, 16-count Fuyan was at 3,150 yuan, 10-count Deli was at 1,700 yuan, factory-produced 16-count Feiji was at 3,150 yuan, 10-count Songhe was at 2,120 yuan, and 16-count Hongkuixing was at 3,130 yuan.</p>
<h3>Military Notes Soar, Driving Cloth Prices Upward</h3>
<p>The cloth market experienced significant fluctuations yesterday. The market was flat in the morning, but due to the surge in military notes in the afternoon, buyers actively competed, and selling prices rebounded sharply, increasing by two to five yuan per bolt compared to the previous day. Trading was more active in the afternoon, with over 500 pieces traded on the street. 16-pound Huadie coarse cloth was quoted at 160 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong was at 80-83 yuan, Baimao calico was at 115-12 yuan, Jishilin cloth was at 205-110 yuan, Changshou plain silk was at 5.35 yuan, mixed brands were at 5.1-5.25 yuan, Lanmulan bleached cloth was at 139 yuan, and Qianqiu striped bleached cloth was at 132 yuan.</p>
<h3>Eastern Cloth Market Recovers After Morning Dip, Re-Igniting Bullish Momentum</h3>
<p>The Eastern cloth market recovered after a morning dip, re-igniting bullish momentum. Prices of various cloths reached new highs. The opening price for new factory orders of leading brand fine cloth was 165-166 yuan, falling to around 160 yuan before rebounding to close at 163.5 yuan. In the afternoon, due to strong buying interest from both internal and external sources, the market opened at 170 yuan and soared to close at 178 yuan, an increase of 13.5 yuan per bolt. Spot prices for leading brands were at 154 yuan, Feiyu was at 160.5 yuan, Caiqiu was at 161 yuan, Yanghe was at 160 yuan, and Laba was at 159 yuan.

New tax red orders rose to a high of 5.45 yuan and closed at 5.35 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rainproof Cloth Soars Unstoppably</h3>
<p>The price of rainproof cloth has continued to rise. The red plate price was 10 yuan per yard, rising to 11 yuan ten days ago, soaring to 11.5 yuan last week, and now reporting an increase to 12.5 yuan. The reasons for the continued increase are:</p>
<p>Rising prices of all goods and increased factory taxes.</p>
<p>Rising raw material costs and increased processing fees.</p>
<p>Difficulties in production and sales due to various environmental factors.</p>
<p>The gradual disappearance of imported raincoat materials.</p>
<p>Rainproof cloth has become popular and well-known, with rapid sales growth.</p>
<p>Only Youzisheng Factory has stock, and Rentai is in the blockade zone. Jin Xiong rainproof cloth dominates Shanghai, causing prices to rise frequently, yet demand still exceeds supply.</p>
<h3>Starting from the 14th, National Rice is Prohibited from Entering the Settlements</h3>
<p>The price of National Rice without a controlling entity has risen sharply. The retail price of thin paddy rice has risen from 28 yuan to 30 yuan per dou, with high-quality rice being priced as high as 33-34 yuan. However, starting from the 14th, National Rice will not be allowed to be transported into the Shanghai International Settlement. It is hoped that there will be proper measures for the distribution of food for the people of Shanghai. Based on the current retail quantities, families with more than three members will face great difficulties.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains Experience Alarming Price Increases</h3>
<h3>Soybean Market Sees Another Round of Price Increases</h3>
<p>The soybean market is seeing another round of price increases due to scarce inventory and financial news, driving market sentiment upwards. As a result, soybean prices have risen by six to seven yuan, and red beans and broad beans have soared by more than ten yuan. 100 bags of Tianjin Jinyuan soybeans were sold at 190 yuan, 50 bags of Qingdong Doudou were sold at 188 yuan, two carts of Linhuaiguan soybeans were sold at 185 yuan, 500 bags of Chongming sand were sold at 107 yuan to 116 yuan, 700 bags of sand red were sold at 155 yuan to 168 yuan, 50 bags of Benban red beans were sold at 148 yuan, 100 bags of Jiangbei red beans were sold at 130 yuan to 132 yuan, and 30 bags of Pinghu red beans were sold at 158 yuan.</p>
<h3>Red Sorghum is in Short Supply, Driving Prices Up</h3>
<p>The supply of red sorghum is extremely scarce, and demand remains strong, driving prices up by another ten yuan. Shelled peanuts are also firm. Two carts of Anhui Guang Red Sorghum were sold at 108 yuan to 113 yuan, and 150 bags of Tianjin Lizhuang peanuts were sold at 275 yuan to 280 yuan.</p>
<h3>Soybean Cake Prices Rise Amid Buying Interest</h3>
<p>Soybean cake prices rose yesterday due to positive buying news, with investors actively purchasing. As a result, prices rose by four to five yuan across the board. 1,000 pieces of Fengji soybean cake for April were sold at 49 yuan, over 10,000 pieces of Shenji soybean cake for May were sold at 42.5 yuan to 46 yuan, June were sold at 43.5 yuan to 47 yuan, July were sold at 44.5 yuan to 46.5 yuan, and new March were sold at 48 yuan.</p>
<h3>Wheat Bran Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Wheat bran remains popular with speculators, and scattered retail traders are particularly active. Influenced by the soaring gold market and miscellaneous grains, the market is even more bullish, with prices rising by four to five yuan. Only 2,000 bags were traded. Sanxin large bags opened at 79.56 yuan and rose to 85 yuan. Small bags opened at 80 yuan, then rose to 84 yuan. The sellers were firm and unwilling to sell, and there were no further transactions.</p>
<h3>Banana (III) by Gao Jiannong</h3>
<p>A type as large as lotus root, six or seven inches long, squarely shaped, slightly sweet, is the lowest quality! Jia Sixie's "Qi Min Yao Shu" and Li Shizhen's "Compendium of Materia Medica" quoted Cao Shuya's "Wu Zhi" saying: "The banana bears fruit, its skin is red as fire – this sentence may be mistaken – its flesh is sweet as honey, four or five pieces can satisfy a person, and the flavor lingers between the teeth, hence the name Gan Jiao (Sweet Banana)." The Song Dynasty person Fan Chengda also recorded its properties and effects in "Gui Hai Yu Heng Zhi": "Jiao Zi, the largest of the bananas... The leaves have roots with fruit, remove the skin and take the flesh, soft and mushy like green persimmon – this green character is also strange! Extremely sweet and cold!... Locals sometimes feed it to small children, saying it is cooling and removes heat. Preserved with plum juice and dried in the sun, pressed flat, the flavor is sweet and sour with a light frost, what the world calls "Banana Jerky"... " Judging from this "Banana Jerky" description, bananas can also be dried and preserved like people making peach preserves, apricot preserves, or "persimmon cakes"; I don't know if this method has been passed down to the present, and I don't know if anyone still makes them this way. Unfortunately, in Shanghai, I have not had the good fortune to taste this unusual flavor!</p>
<p>The Ming Dynasty person Gu Wei of Wu County said in his "Hai Cha Yu Lu": "Hainan bananas bloom and bear fruit year-round, there are two types: one is called 'Ban Jiao' (Board Banana)", large and bland; one is called 'Fo Shou Jiao' (Buddha's Hand Banana) small and sweet; commonly called 'Jiao Zi'...." As for the Fuzhou Fu Zhi, it also says that there are "Xiang Ya Jiao" (Ivory Banana) and "Fo Zhi Jiao" (Buddha's Finger Banana) among the local products; one describes the color of the banana, and one describes the shape of the banana, the names are all very elegant and lovely." From the above cited books, the most common names for bananas in ancient times were "Gan Jiao" or "Jiao Zi"; (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Spring and Autumn Dynamics by Zhou Mo</h3>
<p>"Confucius was at leisure, and Zigon entered to attend him, seeing that his face had a worried expression. Zigon did not dare to ask, and went out to tell Yan Hui. Yan Hui then took up the lute and sang. Confucius heard it, and summoned Yan Hui in, asking, 'Why are you so happy?' Yan asked in return, 'Why are you so worried, Master?' Confucius said, 'Speak your mind first.' Yan said, 'I once heard the Master say that he who is happy in Heaven and knows his destiny does not worry, and this is the reason for my joy.' Confucius looked grave for a while and said, 'Are those my words? You only know the happiness of knowing Heaven and destiny without worry, but you do not know the great sorrow in knowing Heaven and destiny; now, if I tell you to cultivate yourself, be content with poverty and prosperity, and know that coming and going are not of your own accord, then that is what you call happiness in Heaven and knowing your destiny without worry. I cultivate poetry and books, correct ritual and music, to govern the world and leave it to future generations, not just to cultivate myself; now the Way is not practiced, there is no saving the world from chaos, and I do not know how to reform it, this is the sorrow of knowing Heaven and destiny; although I have attained it, without joy and without knowledge, that is true joy and true knowledge, therefore there is nothing that is not joyful, nothing that is not known, nothing that is not worried about, nothing that is not done, what is there to abandon in poetry, books, ritual, and music. Yan Hui bowed and said: 'I have also attained it.' He went out and told Zigon. Zigon was confused, returned home and pondered for seven days, without sleeping or eating, until he was emaciated. Yan Hui went to enlighten him, and when he returned to Confucius's school, he chanted and recited books, never ceasing until the end of his life."</p>
<p>The above anecdote is, of course, from a distant past, but Confucius's virtue matches Heaven and Earth and his teachings are the crown of the ages. This spirit of learning should not be ignored. Zigon excelled at trade, but fortunately, Yan Hui did not die young; otherwise, Zigon would not have been educated and would have wasted his life. It is also fortunate that there is still this record in Liezi, otherwise, would Confucius's teaching of not abandoning poetry, books, ritual, and music in times of chaos have been passed down to this day?</p>
<p>The commendable spirit of learning, regardless of location or age, should still be diligent and studious.</p>
<p>The salary for actors in Peking opera is calculated monthly, but one day's absence results in the deduction of one day's salary. The Great Stage has been closed since the New Year. Not only can extras not survive, but even minor actors are finding other ways out, just as a large number of dancers from the Great Eastern Ballroom are developing into the Gaoshiman Xin Xianlin. After yesterday's reopening, the lineup for "Three Gate Street" will likely be rearranged.</p>
<p>The "business" between the Co-Stage and Wang Guixiang cannot be finalized. Recently, they have been holding onto a "little pigtail," namely seven-year-old, eight-year-old, and nine-year-old actors.</p>
<p>The New Stage is preparing a new play, "The Great Hero Gan Fengchi," scheduled to be performed on Saturday evening, with Guo Yukun as Gan Fengchi, Zhao Songqiao as Liu Er, Xiao Yang Yuelou as Xue Cuihua, Wang Jun as Emperor Qianlong, and Liu Wenkui as Xi Qingru. If it is well-received, a sequel will be arranged.</p>
<h3>Idle Talk on Tofu by Weimo</h3>
<p>The popular phrases "hatching soybean sprouts" and "eating tofu" are ultimately difficult to reach the hall of elegance. The so-called gentlemen of virtue rarely quote or study them; this is not surprising. In fact, tofu, in the eyes of most people, is too humble and worthless.</p>
<p>Putting green vegetables and tofu together inevitably makes people's mouths taste like clear water, "bland and tasteless," and if one serves it for ten or eight days as the main dish, it may not be uncommon. However, on the other hand, those who "bite the vegetable root" and "eat tofu" always have an advantage in terms of survival, whether materially or spiritually.</p>
<p>In a broad sense, soybean sprouts can also be considered vegetable roots. Eating more soybean sprouts is beneficial and harmless to the body and economy. As for tofu, it can be said to be the "central idea" of vegetarians, the basic team in vegetarian restaurants, indestructible and unaffected by any environmental constraints or changes.</p>
<p>Both soybean sprouts and tofu come from soybeans. The former still has traces of its original form, while the latter is completely different. Putting the two together, there is no way to trace their lineage in terms of "appearance and expression." A small soybean can create two different situations between "hatching" and "pressing." It is not necessary to elaborate on this, but more importantly, its value to mankind is still to study "eating tofu" in a proper way.</p>
<p>Professor Litt of the Lester Institute in Shanghai, in his article "The Benefits of Vegetarianism," studied the nutritional value of various foods made from legumes and praised them highly. He used scientific analysis to answer the true value of these "common" foods.</p>
<p>Soybean sprouts are like tadpole script, and their position should be placed at the beginning of the chapter. According to Litt's research, it is richest in Vitamin C. Therefore, when mandarin oranges are treated like treasures and tomatoes have not yet appeared in large quantities, soybean sprouts are a rare source of Vitamin C, and eating them regularly will definitely be beneficial.</p>
<p>Before making tofu, the first step is to grind soybeans into tofu milk, whose nutritional value is no less than that of cow's milk. At the International League meeting in Java in 1937, the function of tofu milk was described as being almost as white as animal milk, and if it could be combined with an appropriate amount of egg yolk, maltose, and mineral salts, its nutritional value would be even higher. Even babies can be breastfed. Once it passes the dragon gate, its value increases tenfold, that is what is meant by tofu milk.</p>
<p>Tofu embodies all</p>
