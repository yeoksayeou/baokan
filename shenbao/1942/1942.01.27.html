<p>公債暗盤、昨市稍有疲象、昨乙種又漲逾十二月六日收盤價、乃有一部份多頭斬結、致形勢巳不若以前之挺秀、聞月底到期應收之第十二期息票、屆期恐不能收取、市上仍常連息票買賣、檯面進出尚屬均衡、甲種開盤七十三元、抬至三元半、收盤仍爲二元半、與前相同、乙種開盤六十九元三角、抬至九元九角、收盤爲九元、比前小五角、丙種開盤六十八元四元、抬至八元九角、收盤爲七元八角、比前小二角、丁種由六十三元五角、抬至四元五角、收盤爲四元、比前略小四角、戊種爲六十五元八角、抬至六元八角、收盤爲五元七角、趨勢爲先漲後跌、大漲小回、略小一角半至四角、甲種不動、成交約四五十萬元、</p>

<h3>銀行女職員的前途</h3>
<p>— 斯華</p>
<p>據傳本埠銀行業公會將作一人事上之決定，議程之前列爲銀行界女服務員的解僱問題，其趨勢則解僱之說恐將成爲事實。如此項措置付諸實施，暫時的，此後將無女性從業員再在銀行界中活躍。</p>
<p>解僱理由是爲了業務淸淡，而女性職員處於次要地位，在目前工作情形下，巳無繼續僱用之必要。其副理由則爲職員（指男性）之解僱，往往增添社會失業問題之嚴重性，恐因之造成不堪想像的後果，而女職員則多少有所依託，同樣遭受失業，其困難程度當不若男性之深。</p>
<p>在事實未表現以前，先作任何猜測或批評是徒然的，但女性在失業狂潮中，成爲被風浪打擊最烈的一份子，巳因此項消息之來，愈加證實。郵局女從業員問題前會一度引起注意，而由若干女界先進據理力爭，其事尙未有若何圓滿之解決。現在銀行女職員解僱問題，雖亦足引起本埠一部份人視綫的集中，但解僱之舉果而實施，恐怕會挽救無方的！</p>
<p>女子銀行之從業員想又當別論，因爲她們能自己支配自己，不若共他銀行之從業員有男女性之分，這不是故將女子銀行來作反比，委實女子進社會與回廚房這一問題之討論，足能消磨討論者的一生，其結論能否符合最高理想却還是疑問。</p>
<h3>舞壹與銀幕</h3>

<p>夏霞最近息影家園，從事於寫作，聞四幕劇「文君怨」巳脫稿。</p>
<p>華年將於二月一日遷入徐家匯華聯廠工作，該公司宣傳部同人預定兩星期出來一次，其口號曰「到上海去！」</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十七　歸宿</p>
<p>根本他的寒熱並沒有退下去，咯血也不會停止，只是每次咯出來的血，秋海棠都吐在一張張的碎紙裏，揑成一團，丟往床下去，每晚在梅寳出去以後，他才假說是吐的痰，請韓家那位姑娘替他掃出去，因此梅寳一直沒有知道，總以爲他的咯血已經止住了。同時秋海棠的失眠症也從病後起格外加重，往往一日夜二十四小時裏，睡不到兩個鐘頭，這一點他自己也知道是足以致命的大患，然而他從沒有跟梅寳說過，並且永遠不預備說。</p>
<p>至於他想詢問梅寳的是什麼呢？第一是這十數天來的生意何以如此好，梅寳往往在八九點鐘才跟韓老頭兒出去，不到十點半鐘便巳忽忽趕回了，問她唱到多少錢，却每天總是三十四十，這種情形實在很反常。秋海棠是一個患肺病的人，心裏永遠很淸明，當然要覺得詫異起來。第二是最近兩天來，他偷看梅寳的神淸雖然似乎很興奮，但突然又借了一個推託，在每晚出去的時候，硬生生地把韓家姑娘拉了同走，而讓韓老太太上樓來照看自己。這兩點都同樣的使他很困惑。可是他向來知道梅寳的性格，這些錢絕對不會是打歪裏來的，而梅寳的拉着韓家姑娘一起出去，也必然有着她的理由，所以他還是忍耐着不問。（三一六）</p>

<h3>British Aircraft Bomb Axis Powers' Giant Ship</h3>
<p>London, 26th, Reuters: According to an announcement by the Air Ministry, our reconnaissance aircraft discovered several giant merchant ships on Friday morning last week, escorted by a battleship, a cruiser, and several destroyers, heading from the Aegean Sea to North Africa. In the afternoon of the same day, our air force and naval aircraft attacked them. The first bomb landed near the battleship, and the ship immediately changed course. Our torpedoes also targeted the ship, but the results of the bombing were not observed. Later in the evening, our naval aircraft spotted the convoy again and bombed each target from an altitude of 4,000 feet. A 20,000-ton giant ship at the rear of the convoy was hit by a torpedo, and flames erupted. It immediately stopped sailing. A destroyer was also hit in the stern, and the explosion was very loud. Before midnight, the convoy was spotted for the third time. Our Wellington bombers attacked for an hour and a half. The giant ship damaged by the torpedo was hit several more times.

<h3>U.S. Secretary of the Navy Warned of Possible Japanese Attack on Honolulu; Naval Authorities on the Island Failed to Conduct Prior Assessment</h3>
<p>Washington, 25th, Havas: The Commission of Inquiry into the Japanese air raid on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, recently released its report, stating that Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox wrote to Secretary of War Stimson on January 24, 1941, strongly stating that relations between the United States and Japan were tense. If war were to break out, Japan might attempt a surprise attack on the U.S. fleet concentrated in Hawaii. Japanese attacks would take one of the following forms: 1. Attack by bombers; 2. Attack by aerial torpedoes; 3. Sabotage of land-based military facilities; 4. Attack by submarines; 5. Laying minefields; 6. Attack by artillery fire. Subsequently, the military authorities took important measures to protect the islands from air raids. The Japanese Consul General in Honolulu was also engaged in activities harmful to the United States. The Japanese Consul General hired a staff of 200 people for his use last summer, which is clear evidence. As for the course of the Japanese air raid, the Japanese navy and air force participating in the operation included three or four aircraft carriers, many other warships, several submarines, and an estimated 150 to 200 fighter planes, bombers, and planes carrying aerial torpedoes. Most of the damage suffered by the U.S. fleet was caused by aerial torpedoes. The first Japanese attack was at 6:30 AM (Hawaiian time). When a U.S. patrol heard that strange boats had appeared near Pearl Harbor, they identified them as small Japanese submarines and immediately sank them, reporting the incident to the land-based duty officer. The duty officer received the report at 7:12 AM and immediately reported the message to the General Headquarters, but no alarm was issued. At 7:55 AM, Japanese planes officially began bombing. At least two Japanese submarines had entered Pearl Harbor. A submarine protection net was installed in the harbor in early December, but it could only be lowered at night, and it was thought that warships stationed at the entrance of the bay would be able to detect any enemy submarines. As for land-based air defense equipment, it was still under construction and had not been completed by December 7. Therefore, Pearl Harbor did not have a large number of trained personnel capable of performing day and night patrols and prevention work until December 27, 1941. Former Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Fleet Admiral Kimmel repeatedly received reports stating that the air defense equipment was extremely complete. Although Admiral Kimmel received instructions from the government, he did not examine them. In addition, the Navy Department ordered aerial patrols of Oahu Island, but they had not been implemented before December 7.</p>

<h3>Jardine Matheson's Safe Deposit Boxes Open; Land Deeds and Bankbooks May Be Withdrawn; Legal Tender Must Be Deposited Into Mitsui Bank; Gold, Silver, and Cash May Be Withdrawn</h3>
<p>Since the Allied banks in this city were permitted to resume operations, the eight banks, including HSBC, Jardine Matheson, American Orient, Citibank, American Express, China Banking Corporation, Netherlands Indies Commercial Bank, and Hollandsche Bank, have been processing the second round of deposits and withdrawals for one week, which is about to be completed. The American Chase Bank is still processing the first round of deposits and withdrawals. Other banks, such as Sassoon, Mercantile, American Foreign Insurance, and Da Shang, are still in the process of liquidation and have not been able to process deposits and withdrawals. However, safe deposit boxes and securities seals in each of these banks have not yet been allowed to be opened. Jardine Matheson Bank has obtained the consent of the Japanese authorities, and as of yesterday (the 26th), all safe deposit boxes can be opened in succession. However, the objects that users withdraw are temporarily limited to land deeds, passports, bankbooks, and legal tender.</p>
<p>More Than 500 Registered Safe Deposit Box Holders</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson Bank's safe deposit boxes opened as scheduled starting at 2:00 PM yesterday. It is understood that there are more than 2,000 safe deposit box holders in the bank, but the Japanese liquidation personnel, in order to avoid congestion, only allow 30 to 40 safe deposit boxes to be opened each day. Therefore, each safe deposit box holder must register with the bank between 10:00 AM and 12:00 PM each day, specifying the safe deposit box number, and then the bank staff will designate the opening date according to the registration order. At that time, they can bring keys, stamps, etc. to the safe deposit box department of the bank to withdraw the objects that are allowed to be withdrawn according to regulations (if the lease has expired, the rent must be paid). It is heard that a quarter of the registrants were yesterday, accounting for about 500 households. As only 30 to 40 households are allowed to open each day, the designated opening date for the tenants who registered last has been scheduled to the end of the lunar year. The bank posted a notice at the door, writing, "Attention to all safe deposit box holders, opening from January 26 (except Sundays) at 2:00 PM every afternoon, registration in the morning. Tenants who have expired must continue to pay rent."</p>
<p>Notice Stipulates Opening Method</p>
<p>Mitsui Bank and Jardine Matheson Bank jointly issued a notice yesterday, clarifying the regulations on the opening of safe deposit boxes. The main points are as follows: (1) People of enemy countries can withdraw: bankbooks, checkbooks, statements, deposit receipts, passports, land deeds, and Chinese legal tender (must be deposited into Mitsui Bank, and if there is no business relationship, an account can be requested to be opened). (2) People of neutral countries and Chinese can withdraw: bankbooks, checkbooks, statements, deposit receipts, passports, land deeds, local stock securities (limited to Chinese legal tender), legal tender (must be deposited into Mitsui Bank, and if there is no business relationship, an account can be requested to be opened). (3) People of any nationality are prohibited from withdrawing: gold, silver, jewelry, and currency; U.S. dollar bills and British pound bills; and valuable securities denominated in foreign currencies.</p>
<p>Transferring Legal Tender to Mitsui; Interest Rates Clarified</p>
<p>Mitsui Bank, the Japanese bank that is clearing Jardine Matheson Bank, stipulates that the legal tender of Jardine Matheson Bank's depositors and those who have taken it out of the safe deposit boxes, must be deposited into the bank. Therefore, it has now stipulated the interest rates for deposits of people of all countries: for Chinese and people of neutral countries, the weekly interest rate for current deposits is 1%, the weekly interest rate for savings is 2%, and the weekly interest rate for fixed deposits is 5%, limited to new deposits.</p>
<p>HSBC Safe Deposit Box Opening; Currently Under Negotiation</p>
<p>Yesterday, reporters inquired with the British HSBC Bank about when the safe deposit boxes of the bank could be opened. According to the bank staff, the person in charge is currently negotiating with the Japanese clearing personnel at all levels. Presumably, since Jardine Matheson has been opened, the bank may be allowed to be opened by way of example. The date of implementation is not far away.</p>

<h3>Raid on a Bandit Den on Avenue Edward VII, Sixteen Bandits Arrested, Long History of Robbery, Numerous Unsolved Cases</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, in conjunction with the French Concession Police Department, raided a bandit den on the Friday and Saturday of last week, arresting sixteen bandits. Two women were also present in the house and were taken to the police station along with the bandits. It is reported that the successful raid was due to the efforts of a Chinese detective. This detective was investigating another case at a residence on Avenue Foch when he saw five men running out of a neighboring house. Suspecting something amiss, he secretly followed them. The five men turned into another location and finally arrived at No. 68 Avenue Edward VII, where they did not emerge. It was later learned that a robbery had occurred at the residence on Avenue Foch from which the five men had fled. The police ordered the detective and several others to surround No. 68 Avenue Edward VII. When they entered the house, they found no one. The detectives waited patiently and eventually arrested all sixteen bandits. According to one bandit, a large lead box was found in a room at No. 1642 Avenue Edward VII, containing a Mauser rifle, two automatic pistols, and a large quantity of ammunition. This gang of bandits had been committing robberies for a long time, and there are many unsolved cases. It is also reported that this case will be heard this week.</p>
<h3>French Ships Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Shipping lines between this city and various ports in Europe, America, and Southeast Asia have been severed since the outbreak of the Pacific War on December 8th of last year, a period of over four months. The French ship "Kim-Dinh" arrived in Shanghai from Haiphong, Vietnam, on the 20th of this month. Details have already been reported. It is now learned that the second French ship, "D'albert Sarraut," also arrived in Shanghai from Haiphong on Saturday evening of last week, docking at the Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong. Cargo unloading began yesterday morning. The "Kim-Dinh" is scheduled to return to Vietnam at the beginning of next month.

<p>The crowd at the Shanghai Municipal Council's office for issuing return-to-hometown permits to residents has been increasing daily. The number of applicants is around three thousand per day, with yesterday being particularly high, reaching a record of over three thousand. From the entrance on Fuzhou Road, up the stone steps, and to the first-floor corridor, applicants formed long queues. The majority were returning to Ningbo. Many who had obtained permits but were unable to secure boat tickets to Ningbo returned to the office to complain about their stranded situation. Yesterday, some people petitioned the authorities, hoping that the "Moufu" ship, detained in Zhoushan, could be released to return to Shanghai and transport those stranded in Shanghai directly to Ningbo, so that they could return to their hometowns as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Student Aid Applications Closed Yesterday, Continued Appeal for Support from All Sectors, Increased Tuition Fees at All Schools, More Applicants, Strict Selection, Continued Hope for Social Sympathy and Donations</h3>
<p>Since the launch of the second "Shen Bao" Reader Student Aid program, due to the general weakness of social economic strength and the recent sluggishness of various industries, coupled with the approaching Lunar New Year, the number of application forms received from students has multiplied compared to the previous session. This newspaper, with its benevolent heart of "treating the hunger of others as one's own," has generously donated, but still feels the sentiment of "how can one obtain a great shelter to make all poor scholars in the world happy."</p>
<p>Filling Out Forms: Many Incomplete</p>
<p>Therefore, the investigation and review of this session must be strict. There are many students who have completed the forms completely, but there are also not a few who have been perfunctory. For a poor student who studies hard, the urgent desire to study for their own future and the failure to take the formalities seriously, strictly speaking, this student is suspected of not cherishing themselves.</p>
<p>Old Student Performance: Fair Review</p>
<p>In addition, those students who were granted student aid in the first session and have excellent performance this session may continue to receive assistance. At least a small number of students who have been frequently absent from class and have mediocre performance cannot be helped. All these situations will be fairly and carefully reviewed. It is hoped that all the students who apply will pay attention to this.</p>
<p>Appeals: Hundreds Arriving Daily</p>
<p>In recent days, hundreds of letters have been received from students, either without a return address or describing their family situation and appealing for assistance. Some have not even read the student aid measures announced by this newspaper daily, causing the staff handling the student aid to reply to hundreds of letters every day. This situation is a waste of manpower.</p>
<p>Form Regulations: Many Are Not Familiar</p>
<p>It should be known that filling out the application form requires the applying student to come to the newspaper office in person to obtain the form and fill it out according to the instructions. This has been published in the newspaper many times. If one can pay attention to reading the newspaper, there would be no need to inquire by letter. In the future, students will have to serve society. Today's carelessness is also a weakness in future service. It is hoped that the students will correct this. Although the staff is overwhelmed with paperwork, we will continue to do our best. If we can eliminate the students' habit of carelessness, it is what we deeply desire.</p>
<p>Continuous Processing: Investigation and Interview</p>
<p>As for the application deadline, it ended on the 26th. The letters received from students on the 26th cannot be processed. From today, we will no longer accept registration forms. We are now rushing to conduct investigations, interviews, and reviews. The date when the approved list is announced will be the date when payments begin. Those who are not approved will not be notified separately. Please pay attention.</p>
<p>Pacing Around: No Solution</p>
<p>There is still more to be said. The number of applicants in this session is double that of the past, and tuition fees at all schools have also increased sharply. The accumulated savings are not much. The staff examines the forms, which are piled up like mountains. Among these thousands of poor students waiting for orders, we do not know who can be selected and who will be forced to drop out of school. Therefore, we pace around the room, unable to find a solution. We feel like a clever housewife who cannot cook without rice. We also fear that we will barely be able to cope with this session and will have nothing to continue with in the next session.</p>
<p>Eagerly Hope: Generous Donations from All Sectors</p>
<p>The staff also knows that the social economic strength is weak and there is nothing to donate. However, we believe that education is a century-long plan and youth is the pillar of society. If we do not cultivate them, it will be a loss for the future. The readers of this newspaper have worked together to create this great act of righteousness. Looking forward to the future, how can we bear to let it be interrupted? Therefore, we urgently appeal, hoping that all sectors will generously donate funds so that we can manage the current situation and have a foundation for future sessions. Readers are understanding and will definitely support us.

<h3>Beggar Grabbing Food Beaten to Death by Passerby</h3>
<p>At around 11:00 AM yesterday morning, in front of the Lu Gaojian meat shop on Xinzha Bridge Road, a beggar (approximately 30 years old) was stopped and severely beaten by a passerby for grabbing food from a woman's hand. Unexpectedly, the blows struck a vital spot, and he immediately fell to the ground and died. The patrol officer summoned an ambulance to send him to the hospital for an examination. After confirming the death, he was sent to the morgue for an autopsy, and the assailant is being investigated.</p>
<h3>Gang Purchasing Rice Using Counterfeit Money, Seven or Eight People Detained</h3>
<p>At around 10:30 PM the night before last, a man from Jiangbei named Meng Xiaorong transported five dou of white rice from Longhua to Shanghai to sell. When he arrived at the intersection of Malan Road and Xujiahui Road, three ruffians pretended to buy the rice. They agreed on a price of $19.50 per dou, totaling $97.50. They paid with a new legal tender $100 bill from the Bank of Communications and were given $2.50 in change, while another accomplice took the rice away. Meng did not know how to distinguish real from counterfeit currency. He went to a nearby tobacco shop to check, only to find that the bills were counterfeit. A dispute arose, and the patrol officer from the nearby post arrived and detained one person, identified as Hang Xiaoming, who lived on the third floor of No. 17 Gongji Lane, Xujiahui Road. Five hundred dollars in counterfeit money were found in his residence. He confessed that he and his accomplices specialized in using counterfeit money to deceive villagers in the two settlements. The number of people they have deceived is countless. Six or seven of his accomplices were subsequently apprehended and taken to the police station for investigation.</p>
<h3>Multiple Theft Cases Solved in Three Days</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of winter, theft cases have been occurring frequently in the International Settlement. In view of this, the police authorities, in addition to increasing the security force at each police station, have also ordered all Chinese and foreign detectives to step up their investigation and arrest work. This work has been effective. The police station has solved many theft cases in three days. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese detective Liu Junjie and detective Liu Yukun of the Old Zhabei Police Station arrested two bandits, Jin Dongsheng (also known as Xiao Liuzi) and Li Hongfa, from Jiangbei, in Room 470 of the Jue Lu Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road.

Two fake pistols were confiscated.</p>
<p>On January 23rd, the home of Yu Gaofeng at No. 61 Shanxi Road was burglarized. When the thieves fled, they were followed by detectives. Chinese detective Qi Mengqing and detective He Zhizhong and Indian patrolman No. 353, dispatched by the Old Zhabei Police Station, apprehended a bandit from Ningbo named Wang Aliang and confiscated a fake pistol.</p>

<p>Chinese detective Xu Decheng from the Gordon Road Police Station arrested a notorious bandit from Jiangbei named Rui Jinbiao on Avenue du Roi Albert. It was discovered that in addition to committing numerous theft cases, he had kidnapped a wealthy businessman on Singapore Road on July 20, 1940.</p>
<p>All of the above cases were transferred to the Criminal Court 1, 2, and 3 of the Special First District Court yesterday. After questioning by the judge, they were ordered to be detained for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Recent News from Zhonghui Leather Shoe Company</h3>
<p>In view of the suspension of public and private vehicles in the city, the Zhonghui Leather Shoe Company at No. 232 Tongfu Road has specially manufactured a large number of the latest low-heeled running shoes, which are sturdy and comfortable and come in a complete range of sizes, to facilitate walking. In order to promote business, the company has reduced the price, which is only half of the market price. It is also reported that customers who purchase over $100 will receive a free box of valuable shoe-shining supplies. Therefore, there has been a surge in customers recently.</p>
<h3>Summary of Theft Cases</h3>

<h3>New Rules on Prohibiting Tips and Other Matters, Written Approval from Consular Body, Strict Enforcement to Be Announced Soon</h3>

<p>Business News</p>
<h3>National Rice Gradually Decreasing</h3>
<p>Yesterday, national rice arrived in an endless stream, and the goods that arrived on the previous day's holiday were also reported for sale together. Therefore, in addition to the inventory in the market, more than 300 shih of new goods were sampled. In addition, the solicitation along the way and direct allocation did not decrease due to the rain. Therefore, although the official selling price of foreign rice has increased by 2 jiao per 3 sheng, the national rice market has become weak. In the early and late rice areas of Nanlu, Sijing, Qibao, and Qingpu, the price of the unified small rice was 23 yuan. Early rice ranged from 193.5 yuan to 192 yuan, while thin rice ranged from 194 yuan, 193 yuan to 192.5 yuan. The arrival and consumption of North japonica and Yuan rice were balanced, and both remained flat. Jintan white yuan was still priced at 200 yuan. North japonica ranged from 228 yuan to 224 yuan, and 238 yuan with the bag. The market transaction was also for households to replenish their supplies on Monday, with a transaction volume of 280 to 290 shih.</p>
<h3>Oil Beans Mostly Upward</h3>
<p>Edible oil remained firm. 30 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were sold, priced at 430 yuan.</p>
<p>The source of soybeans has become scarce, and the price has risen again. Tianjin's new Jin Yuan reached a new high of 130 yuan, rising 2.5 yuan. Pinghu Du bean was 128 yuan. Red beans and broad beans were firm and stable. Chongming sand red was 85 yuan to 86.5 yuan.</p>

<h3>Gold Bar Fluctuated Very Narrowly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold bar market fluctuated in the dark market, and people's minds were quite stable. The morning securities firms mutually traded 10 taels, priced at 10,600 yuan, down 50 yuan. Then, a certain silver building sold gold bars, down to 550 yuan. Tongkang Yonglai entered 120 taels, and the financial community's gold firms helped to absorb them. Tianyuan's agency Hongchang also bought, and the price rose 250 yuan, reaching 800 yuan. Another securities firm sold 60 taels, which was immediately suppressed by more than 200 yuan. The securities firm sold the remaining 10 taels of Yongxin for 590 yuan. Jin Yuan bought in, and the price rose by dozens of yuan. After 11:00, the fluctuations became even narrower. At noon, it was 10,650 yuan, the same as Saturday's price. The day's fluctuation was 250 yuan, and the transaction volume was 1,500 to 1,600 taels.

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation, British and American gold pounds remained at the original level. US dollar tickets were still 15.4 yuan, Hong Kong dollar tickets rose to 2.65 yuan, and military tickets also rose to 3.98 yuan.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Slightly Weakened</h3>
<p>The government bond dark market was slightly sluggish yesterday. Yesterday, Type B rose again above the closing price on December 6, and some bulls closed their positions, so the situation was not as strong as before. It was heard that the 12th period interest coupons due at the end of the month might not be collected. The market still often trades with interest coupons. The surface transactions were still balanced. Type A opened at 73 yuan, raised to 3.5 yuan, and closed at 2.5 yuan, the same as before. Type B opened at 69.3 yuan, raised to 9.9 yuan, and closed at 9 yuan, 0.5 yuan smaller than before.

The transaction volume was approximately 400,000 to 500,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The black market for foreign stocks was more enthusiastic. 100 shares of British Union were traded at 16.7 yuan, Yangtze at 10.05 yuan, Asia Shipping at 7 yuan, Xiangtai at 24 yuan, Steel at 15 yuan, China Business traded at 6.5 yuan and 9 yuan, Jardine Matheson traded at 45 yuan and 48.5 yuan, Paper traded at 4 yuan and 4.2 yuan, Cultivation ranged from 17.5 yuan to 19 yuan, Galentin's entry price was only 0.65 yuan, sold at 1 yuan, Yeguang was 17.1 yuan, Jardine Matheson Brewery was 3.9 yuan, Jardine Matheson Spinning was 19.5 yuan, China Textile was 7 yuan, Tram was 18.25 yuan, Zilaihuo was 7.1 yuan, Langzhi and Rubber were both 10 yuan, and Kaiping was 22 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn Industry Busy Registering, Transactions Quiet</h3>
<p>The yarn market was mediocre, and transactions did not progress. This was because traffic on the roads was difficult, and buying and selling was blocked, resulting in quietness. The market will recover after the entire solution is announced. On the other hand, the industry is busy with registration procedures, and business is even more bleak. The original price of 20 count Double Horse factory yarn was 1,400 yuan, but it weakened to 395 yuan. Finally, someone wanted it for 400 yuan. As a result, it fell by 30 yuan compared to the previous day. The current price of 20 count Double Globe was 1,970 yuan, Double Horse was 2,055 yuan to 25 yuan, Yueqin was 2,295 yuan to 75 yuan, and 42 count Blue Phoenix was 3,960 yuan. The factory yarn prices were 18 count Weaver Girl 2,020 yuan to 30 yuan, and 20 count Blue Phoenix 2,360 yuan, which were factory yarn prices.</p>
<h3>Cloth Industry Emotions Uneasy</h3>
<p>--Spot Goods Have Risen Without Falling--</p>
<p>The cloth merchants in the factory cloth industry were busy registering the detained goods yesterday, and their emotions were uneasy. Transactions were even lighter, but merchants were unwilling to sell their goods easily, so spot goods have risen without falling. For example, 16-pound Samsung coarse cloth was priced at 102 yuan, Shuanglong at 100 yuan, and Xilin cloth and other blue cloths continued to rise by 35 yuan per piece. Xiaoji blue cloth was priced at 151 yuan.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: The sales momentum of dyed products continued to be strong. More than 300 packages of medium-grade fine cloth were traded, so the spot market has also become gradually lively. The afternoon closing price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth factory yarn was 83 yuan, up 1 yuan from last week. The spot prices of Longtou and Feiwei, Caiqiu, and Yanghe all require 90 yuan and are still in short supply. The highest price for the Sijunzi serge warehouse receipt was 2.83 yuan, up 8 fen per yard, while the spot goods were slightly weaker, priced at 3.1 yuan. The total transaction volume was approximately 100 boxes.</p>
<h3>Walnuts and Walnut Meat Rise Together</h3>
<p>The market for walnuts has become more active recently due to the scarcity of arrivals, and the market trend has turned upward. Southern walnuts opened at 160 yuan yesterday, and walnut meat was sold for 530 yuan, a rise of 60 to 70 yuan. Hand-picked peaches were 240 yuan, and Changping peaches were 220 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tobacco Bureau's Hoarding Becomes Even More Severe</h3>
<p>The rise in cigarette prices has become more severe, and transactions at retail stores have also been sparse. Those who hold the goods are hoarding them even more severely. There is still no news of Yizhong's resumption of business. The prices of Big British Brand opened at 6,150 yuan, Old Knife at 5,100 yuan, Wuhua Xiaoxiannu at 4,000 yuan, Pinhai at 4,900 yuan, Golden Mouse at 1,850 yuan, Beautiful at 2,700 yuan, 50-branch Small Three Cannons at 11,700 yuan per 10,000, 10-branch at 1,600 yuan, 50-branch Big Three Cannons at 2,150 yuan, and 10-branch at 2,000 yuan, up 200 to 300 yuan. The buying prices of daily necessities have risen sharply. Phoenix matches were 1,750 yuan, Rose was 1,750 yuan, Guben soap was 94 yuan, and Huangxiangmao was 73 yuan.</p>

<h3>The Future of Female Bank Employees</h3>
<p>—Si Hua</p>
<p>It is rumored that the Shanghai Banking Association is about to make a personnel decision, with the dismissal of female employees in the banking sector being at the top of the agenda. The trend is that the dismissal is likely to become a reality. If this measure is implemented, there will be no more female employees active in the banking sector, at least temporarily.</p>
<p>The reason for the dismissal is the sluggishness of business, and female employees are in a secondary position. Under the current working conditions, it is no longer necessary to continue employing them. A secondary reason is that the dismissal of employees (referring to male employees) often adds to the severity of the social unemployment problem, which may cause unimaginable consequences. Female employees, on the other hand, have some support, and even if they suffer unemployment, the degree of difficulty is not as deep as that of men.</p>
<p>Before the facts are revealed, making any guesses or criticisms is futile, but women have become the group most severely hit by the wave of unemployment, which is further confirmed by the news. The problem of female employees at the post office once attracted attention, and some female leaders argued their case, but the matter has not yet been resolved satisfactorily. Now, the problem of dismissing female bank employees is also enough to attract the attention of some people in this city, but if the dismissal is actually implemented, I am afraid it will be impossible to reverse!</p>
<p>Female employees of women's banks are another matter, because they can control themselves and do not have the distinction between men and women like employees of other banks. This is not to make a contrast by deliberately using women's banks. In fact, the discussion of the question of women entering society versus returning to the kitchen can consume the lives of the discussants, and it is still questionable whether the conclusion can meet the highest ideals.</p>

<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Seventeen　Destination</p>
<p>Basically, his chills and fever had not subsided, nor had his coughing up blood stopped. It's just that each time he coughed up blood, Qiu Haitang would spit it into scraps of paper, knead them into a ball, and throw them under the bed. Every night, after Mei Bao went out, he would pretend that it was phlegm and ask the Han family's girl to sweep it away for him. Therefore, Mei Bao never knew and always thought his coughing up blood had stopped. At the same time, Qiu Haitang's insomnia also became particularly severe after his illness. Often, he couldn't sleep for more than two hours in a full twenty-four hours. He himself knew that this was a fatal ailment, but he never told Mei Bao, and he never intended to.</p>
<p>As for what he wanted to ask Mei Bao? First, why was business so good these past ten days or so? Mei Bao often went out with Old Man Han around eight or nine o'clock, and hurried back before ten thirty. When asked how much she earned, she always said thirty or forty dollars every day, which was really abnormal. Qiu Haitang, a person suffering from lung disease, was always very clear-headed, and of course, he felt surprised. Second, in the last two days, he secretly observed that Mei Bao seemed very excited, but suddenly, with an excuse, she insisted on taking the Han family girl with her every night when she went out, leaving the Han family's old lady to come upstairs and take care of him. Both of these points equally perplexed him. However, he always knew Mei Bao's character; this money was definitely not from illicit activities, and there must be her reason for Mei Bao taking the Han family girl with her, so he still patiently refrained from asking.
