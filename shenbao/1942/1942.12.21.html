<p>社評</p>
<h3>民意</h3>
<p>人民的力量，是決定一切的力量。</p>
<p>這不僅是新時代政治理論的精髓，而且正是我們中國幾千年政治哲學的最高原則，遠之有孟子「民爲貴」，以及「天視自我民視」的學說，近之更有國父中山先生「民權主義」的倡導，都是有鑒於人民的決定力量而喚起朝野各方注意的。所謂「王道」推其終極，還是「與民更始」以求「得民者昌」而已。在這長期戰時代，我們要求在這戰爭中取得勝利，無論楚精神上的擁戴，物質上的接濟與補充，那一件那一樣不是依賴着人民的？</p>
<p>因此，我們希望友邦日本當局進一步了解中國民意在政治上所起的重大作用，凡是一種政策或法令的推行，必須同時觀察當前最大多數中國人民的需要和民意的趨向，然後適切民意而講求推行的辦法，才能獲得理想的效果，然後可以策其萬全。例如，目前的民食問題，當局所定的原則，非不完善，對於中國人民與對於中日協力這兩方面也是兼籌並顧了，照理論估計，一定可以獲得各方面的贊成和支持。但是，我們從實際情形來觀測，深覺還需要適應中國最大多數的民意的妥善辦法。當然，食糧問題，只是一個例子，其他問題都是如此，僅有原則是不够的，還得有辦法，而辦法的中心，就是要適應中國最大多數的民意。</p>

<h3>粉碎美國的欺騙　——十二月十五日「朝日新聞」社論</h3>
<p>空談戰後的秩序，話說得取多的，恐怕就是美國。但是，這裏所說的戰後秩序，是對的，還是不驛的，不問可知。</p>
<p>去年，十月一日，美國海軍部長諾克斯，主張美英海軍得協力維持全世界海上的治安。這就是說，美英欲以武力監視世界的秩序；他們自己做警察長，對逆他們意的人，就用武力來彈壓。這主張，即在美國國內，也引起了多數人的反對，但是，自任為世界治安及秩序的監察人。警察長的這種態度，到後來，只有愈益固執了起來。</p>
<p>美國的這種世界政策，正如美國人自己指摘的：第一，這是超過美英實力的一種野望；第二，這種高壓的，踞高臨下的態度，相反，倒要引起其他各國的以感，亦未可知。關於第一點，照美國的方法實行起來，美英是想一舉樹立範圍及於世界全體的新體制；作爲紙上談兵？無論這計劃多麼龐大，要想靠二三國家之力見諸實行，到底是不可能的。更進，這二三國家想以己意强迫其他各國遵行，更是亂暴之至。正是這種用以促成新秩序樹立的錯誤的方法，以及他們的傲慢的態度，才成了攪亂和平的要因。這次大東亞戰爭的勃發也就肇因於此。</p>
<p>其次，美國所企圖的和平，到底是怎麼一回事呢？羅斯福　說著四大自由，——那就是言論自由，信敎自由，脫離困窘的自由，不受威脅的自由。和平必須以公正爲前提，那是不待言的。根本上就缺乏着這種前提的他們，要想包攝四大自由，怎麼成呢？赫爾國務卿以互惠通商爲條件，又主張協調之樹立。把東洋人從本國趕出去，在國內拚命地將黑人虐待，藉高率保護關稅對外貨加以排斥，在中南美則以全力進行着掠奪，——特別可恥的是，由於利己主義，幾次三番使國際經濟會議陷於破產：這樣的一個美國，現在居然以互惠通商爲條件，而在大唱其協調之說，這不正好像鬼在唸佛一樣麼？</p>
<p>美國所企圖的新體制，單靠指導者們的幾句空話，我以爲到底是不會成功的。他們的意圖，正像現在在西半球泛美諸國間的關係上已經極具體，極明確地展開了的那樣，是要完成所謂唯利是圖的極端侵略主義。在西半球方面，過去及現在所推行的協調組織，到底是怎樣的東西呢？那就是羅斯福的大棍捧主義，諾克斯的金元外交……等等，在中南美諸國早已吃了一鼻子灰的絕端侵略政策。總之，那不外是藉民主制的假面具以掩蔽其原形的帝國主義而已｛目前，羅斯福在招牌上大書善鄰政策四個大字，但以後，馬脚終於要露出來的。現在，南美的ABC諸國，以及中美的墨西哥，對美國的國際協調組織，不是已經羣起而攻之了麼？總之，就目前西半球的國際組織推測起來，美國的所謂世界政策，是除美國一國外，使全關係國都要顰眉蹙額的東西；也就是只有美國一國能滿足，其餘一切國家都要遭殃的世所謂的「羅馬之征服」。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭勃發以來，匆匆地一年已經過去了。這次戰爭，正是因爲美國唯我獨尊的態度才惹起的。</p>
<p>但是，在皇軍將士的善謀勇戰，以及一萬萬國民的協力團結之下，對美國的霸道，我們正在敢行著嚴肅的膺懲。這不但是大東亞一隅的命運所繫。就是在呻吟於美國利己的制霸政策之下的中南美諸國，一定也很容易諒解日本的眞意，對日本寄與極大的期望的。在此，我們希望要澈底粉碎美國的欺騙。全東亞十萬萬人民，都得明白：目下日本在走的路，是怎樣地接近於大路，怎樣地瀰滿著正義之光。（端譯）</p>

<h3>物資的浪費　一面爭取一面浪費　下年預算難於擬定</h3>
<p>節約的反在、就是浪費、個人浪費了精神、則身體的健康上要發生病象、浪費了金錢、則個人的經濟上要發生恐慌、一個國家浪費了物資、則牠的資源上要發生不足的現象、反之、以浪費換了節約、自然會得到相反的結果、</p>
<p>現代戰爭的勝負、是決定於作戰雙方物資消長的持久程度的、中日事變以來、重慶政權所倡言之「經濟作戰」、三分政治七分經濟等等的話語、都是重視物資的結論、最近渝財政經濟兩部更為進一步爭取物資、擬定了「戰時管理進口出口物品條例」、並把以前頒佈的種種限制辦法、一律廢止、進口貨不以「敵」「友」為取捨標準、凡屬軍需日用物品、概予弛禁、此外、復令各省實行「搶購物資」、以美金公債及節約儲券分配各省推銷、所得現金、作為搶購物資之用、可以說竭盡了「爭」與「搶」的能事、也可以說畢露了窘態了、</p>
<p>可是、重慶政權的措施、往往是虎頭蛇尾、或是立法者的廢法、或是有權勢者的玩法、談到節約、雖無法律的明文規定、但在此時代乃為人人應有的義務、尤其應當公家重於私人、因為私人節約、有時迫於利己的觀念、行之尚易、且今日大多數人的生活、都已瀕於饑餓綫上、節無可節、而最應努力的乃在公家、公務人員、對於公用物品、因不需自己支付代價、不知愛惜、不知保管、任意損壞、任意拋棄、尤以空襲頻繁之際、稍有震毀、一不經意、即行棄置、重新補充、又糜巨帑、在家庭與機關用物化錢的態度、迥然不同、譬如後方公務員的文具、等於前方士兵的槍枝、士兵失落了槍枝、罪有明文的、而後方公務員對於一己所用的文具、則可任意損失、不負任何責任、雖是一筆一墨之微、一印泥一筆尖之細、集少成多、所費也是浩繁、有人說過、公務員之失掉文具、應同士兵喪失槍枝論、在責任上講似科並不為過分、</p>
<p>蘇聯在實施建國的五年計劃的時候、全國節衣縮食、忍耐一切生活享受上的不便、以期建立起國家經濟的鞏固基礎、德國在歐洲是一個戰勝國家、可是每一個德國人、無論貧富、都在國內過着戰時的節約生活、牛肉白麵包是不容易看見的東西、日常零用物品都實行定量分配國家的物資情形容許享受幾多、就只能得到幾多、如欲超過規定的分量、任你有錢也無法買到、回頭看重慶政權當前的環境、國際路綫既先後阻塞、物資來源、頓時斷絕於開源方面很少辦法、而另一面駢枝機關、重床疊架、公務人員、尤其是統治階層、盡情浪費、毫無公理觀念、和責任觀念、這於節流方面又是談不到、在這樣的風氣之下、怎麼能夠真正收到「爭取」和「搶購」物資的效果、就使「搶購」「爭取」到一些、還不是一樣的浪費嗎、既然不具備物資消長的持久程度的條件、那末、怎麼可以得到拖戰的有利結果呢、</p>
<h3>華北資源開發概况　節譯卅一年十二月十一日「大阪新聞」</h3>
<p>大東亞戰爭勃發以來，東北經濟的躍進情形，在各方面殊堪注目，尤其是在重工業方面的開發，異常進步。</p>
<p>鐵礦　民國廿八年七月，蒙疆聯合委員會與華北開發會社各半出資，以二千萬日圓的資本，設立了龍烟鐵鋼株式會社，成為開發的中心。該公司所屬的礦區，係在宜化，懷來，龍關三縣，包括烟山，龐家堡，涿鹿，三叉口等。最初以開發烟筒山礦區為主，龐家堡礦區為附。迨京包綫自宜化站至龐家堡鐵路（即龐家綫）完成後，龐家堡鋼鐵的對日輸出量，逐上躍而凌駕滿洲國之上。該公司因專業逐漸發展，至本年四月，資本增為六千萬日圓，現在銳意於增加出產，力謀發展之中。此外尙有由華北開發會社與大倉鐵業會社各半出資設立的山西製鐵礦業所，亦在從事開採東山，宜襄，寗武等三鐵山，其中以宜襄鐵山為最有望，埋藏量推定為一百二十萬噸，目下正在加緊採掘中。</p>
<p>製鐵事業　從事製鐵者，有河北省的石景山製鐵所，山西省的太原鐵廠，與陽泉鐵廠等三所。石景山製鐵所由龍烟運入礦石，太原及陽泉二廠，則由東山，宜襄、寗武運入礦石，各製成銑鐵及鋼料等。山西及陽泉二鐵廠，為謀改進經營擴充生產起見，於本年四月，由華北開發會社為中心的在華十三家日本公司共同出資，設立山西產業株式會社，管理經營。</p>
<p>煤　煤無論在量方面或質方面，均為華北資源的大宗。目前開發華北實業的中心。即交通通信機關的設立，發電計畫，資源資財的分配等，一切均因煤礦的開發而為優先實施。主要的煤礦有大同，井陘，中興，焦作，柳泉，山西，磁縣等。大同煤礦的增產量達四百萬噸，民國廿九年一月，由華北開發會社，滿鐵會社及蒙疆政府等共同出資，設立大同炭礦株式會社，經營開採。井陘煤礦，由日華合辦的井陘煤礦公司經營開採。該公司創立於民國廿九年七月，現並兼營六河溝西方的煤礦，在石門更設立粉末工塲，以該礦產出的煤為原料，煉製焦煤。中興，焦作，柳泉，山西，磁縣等各煤礦，於民國廿九年十一月以後，聯合經營，由日軍管理。所屬各礦的資本，或由華北開發會社單獨出資，或由該公司與其他日本公司訂約各半了資。其中以中興煤礦為現在軍　管理煤礦之產煤量最大者，其煤質為黏核性的烟煤，發熱量達八千卡路里（Claary）以上，為華北出產之煤中最適於製鐵用者。又柳泉煤因其具有適於低溫乾鎦的性質，最近大受注目，其出產的成績甚佳，本年度將達預定數量以上。此外在山東省的各煤礦，一年以來，亦已在銳意進行開發中。</p>
<p>鹽　關於鹽，最近曾接連數次籌鹽增產計畫，現在進行長蘆　鹽及山東鹽的開發，結果使日本一向依存於遠海鹽者一變而為依存於近海鹽，其出產的鹽，成為日本原料鹽的供給源了。長蘆鹽於民國廿八年八月，在華北開發會社出資一千八百七十五萬日圓，華北政務委員會出資六百二十五萬日圓，合計資本二千五百萬日圓，設立華北鹽業株式會社，經營開發，實行製鹽及精神。一向荒廢的鹽田與手製鹽技術極其幼稚而出產極低的民間鹽田，亦自該公司設立以後，由於鹽田的擴充及技術的改良，完全面目一新。至於山東鹽，原為山東鹽業株式會社所專營，民國廿六年二月設立資本一百萬日圓，民國廿七年三井物產株式會社及三菱商事會社加入經營，資本增為一千萬日圓，三十年六月，華北開發會社讓股權六萬股，於是該公司的經營，隨亦歸附於華北開發會社，大事增產，加強了對日本的後援不少。</p>
<p>其他資源　除上述鐵，煤，鹽等資源的開發外，對於棉花，小麥等農產物的增加生產，亦非常活躍，成為大東亞戰爭勃發以來日本在華北的經濟據點，以逐出美，英勢力，其日漸重要，自不待言。在另一方面，華北已不能仍如向來一樣單成為原料的供給地了，即在加工品等，也差不多到了大半不得再仰給於日本的地步。換句話說，最近的華北，已是到了愈顯確立其自給姿態的時候了。</p>
<p>未來希望　自民國三十一年起，華北已進入了第二次五年計畫的程序，這個計畫的目標，在於五年之後，設立以鐵，煤，鹽為中心的原料品精製工業，使華北由一向為原料供給地的地位一躍而成為工業製造地。此外為增加食糧生產確立河北經濟的自給起見，本年已徹底改善水利。預定自本年二月至明年三月期內，在河北各地，全部建成二十萬處灌溉渠的計畫，內計北京二千，天津三千，保定二萬，石門六萬，邯鄲四萬五千，山東三萬五千，開封一萬五千，山西一萬五千，其他五千。業已開擊完成者，計河北省百分之九十，山東省百分之七十，山西省百分之一百，河南省百分之六十五云，成績湛佳。預料到了明年三月預定期限，必可全部完成。（丁譯）</p>

<p>弟弟呀、有十萬英靈酣睡着的這中國大陸、正是我們埋骨的所在、　　數日前提來的便衣隊、有一個十六歲的少年、是一個和你差不多大的、白面孔的孩子、這少年便衣隊員、是黑夜中、乘了木筏想偷渡怒江時被捉獲的、在他口袋裏、藏着二枚手溜彈、他回答我們的鞫訊說、「爲了蔣委員長、什麽時候我都準備着死」、他斬釘截鐵地說了、以後就議句話也不說了、想想吧、這樣的少年、在中國有很多很多呢、</p>
<p>但是、也有這樣的事、有一個名叫張公忠的敵副團長（中佐等級）、因囊中一張地圖他没有有的只是一綑一綑鈔票、數點了一下、却有三萬元之譜、張中佐在自己營團的大部分被殲滅之後、將營團二千名餉銀領受下来、公然將其一千名分靈數飽了私囊、他這樣招認着、樣子簡直是不知羞恥爲何事、</p>
<p>中國的小兵們在這些腐敗將校的麾下誓死奮戰、這是多麼愚蠢的事呀、然而、比這更狡　的幹部、還有呢、—據俘虜告訴我們、一個名叫楊子龍的敵第五軍的繙譯、流　悲憤之淚、把拳頭向重慶那面揮着、說、「你們知道宋美齡爲什麼渡美去的麼、那是因爲蔣介石及其同謀者把軍費騙了存到美國銀行里、爲要算算利息有多少、才去的呀、還有、因爲抗戰愈弄愈艱難、他們想趁早在國外多置些房產、將來下野之後、好一溜了事、但是、愚昧之極的重慶軍的將士們還蒙在鼓里不知道呢、」</p>
<p>我們覺得楊　譯太可憐、就不談下去了、弟弟喲、置身於從裏面可以窺見重慶心肺的這嚣南的一隅、把蔣政權的前台和後台許多花樣瞧了個透、這是多麼有趣味的事、在下次信里我也許要報告你重慶蔣官邸內部的許多事情、（原文載十二月十五日朝日新聞（中支版）（棘人譯）</p>

<h3>決戰繼續着（三）　平出海軍報道部課長廣播講詞　譯自十二月「讀賣報知」</h3>
<p>戰爭之現階段</p>
<p>從上面各海戰的推移及戰鬥的狀况看來，顯然，這些海戰是可以看作「海上決戰之連續」的。這說明着近代海戰的特質，而爲從來所未有。航空兵力在作戰上的意義之重大，得到實戰的立證，是更爲明顯了。其次，敵人植基於强大的生產力，不管歷次海上決戰的敗北，高呼「最後勝利必屬於我，」仍在執拗地抗戰着…這些事實，我們都不能輕易看過。</p>
<p>日俄戰爭中，日本海一戰而敗北，俄國就此喪失戰意，戰爭也在比較的短時期中匆匆結束了，這次大東亞戰爭，戰爭的終結却不是這樣容易決定的。在這一點上，存在着兩戰爭之本質的差異，是特別要留意的。</p>
<p>其次，我們可以看到，敵人是特別重視所羅門的，爲了確保所羅門之安全，牠不惜傾注了必死的努力。因此，所羅門方面敵人的出擊，是前所未有的大規模的積極作戰。目前美國以此爲「對日本的大決戰」，在宣傳着。國民也都以爲：「日本軍進攻，眞珠灣後，八閱月間，從日本手里又奪回了主動的立塲。」永遠受着戰勝云云的欺騙宣傳的美國國民允其容易趾高氣揚，得意忘形。「美國和聯合國在太平洋上開始了一大進軍，太平洋的潮流立刻要逆流過來了」。簡直是日本軍已被打敗了那么地，現醉在戰勝者的錯覺裏，美國的軍事專家們，也宣稱爲「打破太平洋勢力均衡的一大決戰」，對這决園繞所羅門的海戰，寄與着極大的希望。</p>
<p>著名軍事評論家漢遜，鮑特溫最近自太平洋前綫視察歸來，在紐約時報上批判第一次所羅鬥海戰道：「美國艦隊從航空機接到日本艦隊接近的報吿之後，不動聲色地呆着，僅發了兩三次砲。所以，這次的責任不能單獨歸之於戈姆萊總督一人。這完全暴露了「防過於攻」的心理這一點倘不是正，美國要敗北也說不定。他無視美國海軍部的文吿，而傳出了美國艦隊慘敗的消息。</p>
<p>在所羅門方面，同時，還有我幾多勇士以肉彈擲向敵人。一想到這些爲國成仁的勇士，我們不得不肅然起敬，而致最大的哀悼。但是，正像我們前面說過的，單靠所羅門方面對敵的襲擊，是還不能決定戰爭的總勝負的。因爲美國動員著龐大的生產力，戰爭還在方與未艾呢。</p>
<p>敵之戰備狀況</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭開戰以來，美國在到最近爲止的約一年間，喪失了戰艦九隻，航空母艦約十隻，巡洋艦廿九隻，驅逐艦的五十隻，潛水艇約五十隻。在這時際，一方面將破壞的艦艇加以修補，同時又發表了相當熱鬧的大建艦計劃。根據外國報章傳稱，開戰以來，戰艦四隻，防空巡洋艦六隻，航空母艦及特種航空母艦十隻以上，都相繼建造完工了。再看出現在各海戰中的新艦艇，艦艇建造有相當成績，也是可信的</p>
<p>還有，因爲取航空母艦重點方針的原故，航空機也有飛躍的增勢。據說航空機最近一月中突破四千架之巨數，十一月中一萬噸級的商船也有八十四隻竣工。</p>
<p>同時，我方精銳的新戰艦也有好幾隻早就就役了。開戰以來，從實地受到戰訓，我獨特的航空母艦，巡洋艦及共他艦艇，也都在逐一建造就役中。這樣，我們的海上勢力日益膨大著，威望日益增加著。</p>
<p>兩相比較之下，無問題地我們是可操勝算的。所以，我們萬不可單從數目上過高評價敵人的生產力，而致抱了退縮的觀念。　但是，近代戰之作爲消耗性的長期戰的意義，我們是要深刻考慮到的。尤其生產的戰塲直接與戰塲有關的一點，我們更必須認識淸楚。戰爭目的是要澈底擊滅敵之抗戰力，喪失其作戰意志，從而博取最後的勝利，所以在個別戰鬥上的獲勝，並非就是全盤勝利之謂。尤其是這次戰爭，在尙未獲得最後勝利之前，是絕無任何妥協餘地的。</p>
<p>固然，縱令長期戰也罷，真正決定戰爭大勢的，還在開頭的一兩年；但是，無論如何，這還得着軍·官·民全體的決意和努力如何而定。</p>
<p>總之，我們必須犧牲一切，有一分力出一分力，作爲一個個愛國忠君的日本臣民，向天皇陛下歸一奉公。這樣，我們神國三千年的歷史才得　以不墮。開戰第二年的十二月八日實可說是完全擊滅敵人的真正戰鬥之「新出發點」。決戰在進行著，而且要繼續進行下去的。（錢牧譯）</p>

<h3>靠誰吃飯</h3>
<p>— 濤之</p>
<p>去看一個朋友。</p>
<p>看門的人進去通知了，我就在那裏待着。順眼看見了牆上貼着的一張紙條，想來是那年靑的看門人，用來自勉自動的。紙上這樣的寫着：「流自己的汗，吃自己的飯。。靠天靠人靠祖先，都不楚好漢。」話說得的確是很不錯。</p>
<p>但在現在，要眞正「流自己的汗」，而能「吃自己的飯」，怕己很難。即使幸而不被餓死，而能吃到一口苦飯，那最多亦不過是看門人做上一輩子看門人，小職員做上一輩子小職員而已。在自己心目中，也許會阿Q式似的以「好漢」自傲，但在別人的眼中，就會因你一輩子是個看門人，而說你沒出息。</p>
<p>這社會叫人「有出息」的路，並不是「流自己的汗」，而是要「靠天靠人靠祖先」。許多人硬充養自己心目中的「好漢」，走錯了路，以致弄成了半死不活的沒出息的人。「有出息」的人不用流自己的汗，但可以流別人的汗，要緊的是要有好祖先撑門面，好親友殿後台，而又能捧人，拍人，媚人。</p>
<p>但要是這社會都變成了「靠天靠人靠祖先」的人，而沒有了「流自己的汗」的人，我倒替牠擔憂着，這世界將會變成怎樣的一個世界？</p>
<h3>可敬仰的陳先生</h3>
<p>— 暫無名</p>
<p>普渡衆生，係佛敎的宗旨，捨己救人，係耶穌的宗旨。兩敎雖然門戶各立，但救人的精神則一。可嘆名利塲中，很難發現這種肯犧牲的精神。</p>
<p>昨日敝友介紹一位姓陳的朋友（儒門慈幼院的創辦人）。不禁令我驚異地感到世上竟有那末一個肯犧牲自己的人。</p>
<p>陳君對於中西學識，很有硏究。因愛女死亡，大受刺激。認爲生離死別，係最痛苦的一件事。於是因已及人，決意拚棄名利，終身救濟孤兒，所以慰人，亦所以慰己。可是刦後餘生，無從實現他的願望。他便異想天開，在鎭江，扛一桶石灰，終日在滿街牆上，大書勸人爲善的標語。這種行動，無疑地引起當局的注意。經過幾次的偵查傳訊，都表示同情。最後縣長問他旣想救濟孤兒，經費如何着落。他答：「有一分力，做一分事。可養一個孤兒，就養一個，祗要肯幹，肯犧牲，沒有辦不到的。縣長很受感動，隨即指定雲台山頂經已破壞的圖書館，作爲孤兒收容的地方。他馬上帶着他的妻子，跑到山上。一看門窗均破，於是不辭勞苦，盡已所有，購買應用村料，夫妻二人，日夜修理。有一次，已深夜了，發現窗上少了兩隻釘子，他立即從山頂跑到山下，敲開已經打烊的五金店，買了釘子，跑回山上把窗修好。</p>
<p>這時，他已收養兩名孤兒了。因爲拮据的關係，他每日祗食一頓飯，把節省下來的口糧，以養孤兒，他這種精神，直到今日還是一樣。</p>
<p>最初的時候，當地紳民，都笑他是一個神經病，可是，他的精神，終於感動了譏笑他的人們。助米者有之，捐款者有之。他便慢慢地收養孤兒，今日已有二十四名了。他認定養而不敎，終是憾事。於是聘請兩位熱心而有學識的敎員，和他共同負起這救孤的責任。他的妻子便担任洗滌孩兒衣物，照料孤兒膳宿的責任。數年如一日，並無絲毫怨容。每日早晨五時喚醒孤兒，一同晨操，操後共食早餐，餐后偕同孤兒打掃地方。八時上課，午後偕同孤兒處理園圃。隨時隨地敎導如何爲善，如何爲人。所以這山頂上隨時發現很有禮貌的兒童。</p>
<p>他的精神，他的成績，很受當地鄉紳　嘉許。有幾次到山頂上去訊問他。他全副精神注重孤兒，對於本人的外表，從不修飾。鄉紳祗知其名不識其人，誰也想不到貌表不揚的他，便是克苦救孤的偉人。當鄕紳問他：「陳先生在家嗎？」他很快的回答：「他下山去了。」後來次數多了，鄕紳都疑心起來，有一次，又到山上訪問，坐着不走，一定要見陳先生。坐了幾乎有個把鐘頭，他覺得這次沒法再避，祗得出來承認自己便是陳某。鄉紳問他不見客的理由。他答：「社會人士之表我同情，看在我的成績而已，並不在我陳某個人。我陳某之肯如此苦幹。無非爲孤兒着想而已，並不是爲我個人，我何苦一定要人認識我呢？」</p>
<p>孤兒多了，物價飛漲，他常常憂急自語：「爲善不終，罪莫大焉。」他焦急的情緒，激　了一位朋友的指示，囑他利用園地，廣植無花果。那末來年收獲，不無少補。他立卽跪下叩謝，隨即跑來上海購買三千株，一束一束的梱起，自己扛到北車站，經過種種困難，終於全部運到山上，可是，挨飢餓熬風雨，他因此病倒。別人也許等病好了再來種植。他可不然。他認爲早種一日，則孤兒生計早得一日之保障。扶病起來，和他妻子，一株一株的栽種。現在園內已經可以看見很叢茂的無花果樹了。山上缺管井水，自來水又不捨得去用，但是無花果又不能一日無水，他便每日半夜起床，手挽兩隻鐵桶，跑到山下汲水，再跑回山上去灌溉。這樣的跑上跑下，直至孤見晨操爲止。可憐他人擁被高眠的當兒，正是他披星戴月跑山汲水的時候。他常說：「蒼天有知，當鑒此心。」</p>
<p>他雖然敝屣名利，可是他的事蹟，很迅速的廣播起來。熱心人士，都佩服他的精神，同時也很可憐他的東措西籌。竟有人肯捐荒地數十畝，俾他得以自耕自食，庶幾可免他日夕焦急「為善不終」的憂慮。他固然是感激到不可言狀，可是他的焦急又是不是不可言狀哩。他認為地是有了，開墾的經費，從何籌措。終日嗟嘆，見者動容。鄉紳們憐其苦心，多允將所藏的書畫，借他展覽，藉募款項。他喜極若在，跑來上海，東奔西跑，自己一個人，跑了一個多月，居然他的熱誠，感動了滬地聞人的贊助，書畫展覽會竟然在寗波同鄉會舉行了。</p>
<p>陳君的　蹟，近乎佛家的無我，儒家的克己，耶穌的捨生，這種偉大精神，是値得人們的敬仰。倘能推而廣之，未始非一般孤苦的福音。最低限度，他捨己救人，普渡孤兒的苦心，是應供諸社會而不應泯滅的。至於他的大中，未便宣佈，以成全他不慕名的心蹟。好在展覽會尙未閉幕，雲台山頂的孤兒尙在，有心人儘有訪問的機會哩。</p>
<h3>題字和序文</h3>
<p>— 客觀</p>
<p>假如我們到書舖募或圖書館裏，隨便檢閱書籍，常見書籍的前幾頁，總是題字或序文之類的東西。我們雖未曾加以精密統計，但至少可以肯定地說，我　近幾十年來的出版物裏，題字或序文特別多，而且全是浮泛，空洞無物。有幾本書裏，請人題的字和做的序，竟佔了二三十頁之多。題字作序的人，不是要人，便是名流，與書的內容全無關係。最滑稽的是：一本文學書上，有着不少目不識丁之軍人的　字和序文，內容空泛冬烘，簡直和題寫訃聞一般。</p>
<p>就事論事，請人題字做序，並非絕對要不得的事。倘若自己寫了一本有意義的稿子，送請這門學問的權威學者校訂批評，那權威學者題幾個字或做一篇有價値的序文，這可增加讀者的興趣和理解力，這原是有意義的工作。</p>
<p>不過，當前的事實絕非如此。有許多稿子是編輯而不是著作，犯不着題字做序；而却大動干戈，請些不相干的名人題寫，藉此「登龍」揚名。那些專給人題字做序的名人，忙得或懶得連原稿都沒看見，却「懸空八隻脚」地，「像煞有介事」地題寫起來，竭恭維稱道之能事。其實，不過互相標榜罷了！有時候，作者預先擬就了字句或文章，請名人抄寫一過，或簽上一個姓名出版。彼此「相視而笑，莫逆於心」。</p>
<p>古時候，著作人常在自序上說些「災梨禍棗」等客氣話。如果眞的是「災梨禍棗」者，那首先該是無聊的題字和序文了。</p>
<p>「　獲不及」關於題字和序文，也是如此，有許多書籍，尤其是譯稿，爲讀者計，絕對需要一篇介紹　批判原作的序文的。可是一般譯者却懶得不肯加。這或許是藏拙吧？但是讀者苦了。</p>
<p>至誠地，希望一般作家和出版家，虎處爲讀者利益打算，爲出版物成本打算；時刻不忘這個原則：增加讀者的利益，而不增加讀者購買的負擔。</p>
<h3>談談老鼠</h3>
<p>— 吉思</p>
<p>老鼠之老，並不含有年紀的意義；因為剛出世的老鼠，就稱做小老鼠，這和小老虎之老，同樣地不表示什麼。</p>
<p>北方人稱老鼠爲耗子，倒確實表示了老鼠的性格；因為老鼠對於我們人　，是有消耗性的。家裏有了老鼠，食物，衣服以至用具，將無一不被消耗着。</p>
<p>依據達爾文的演化論來說，老鼠在世界上出現，比人類爲早。從古到今，老鼠　於人類，可說有百弊而無一利。詩經所載，關於老鼠的，例如「誰謂鼠無牙，何以穿找墉！」</p>
<p>「碩鼠碩鼠，無食我黍！……碩鼠碩鼠，無食我麥！……碩鼠碩鼠，無食我苗！……」對於老鼠，都不懷好感。至於所有名詞，凡牽涉到鼠的，也都用來表示汚辱賤視之意，例如「鼠子」「鼠技」「鼠輩」「鼠竄」「鼠瞻」「鼠竊」「獐頭鼠目」等</p>
<p>一般迷信的人們，對於老鼠的舉動，很是重視。所見「老鼠數錢」的聲音，倘若是在黃昏時候，設表示有財氣　門；倘若在天亮時候，說表示財氣出門。其實，這不過老鼠什遇到危險時候，全身的毛豎起，嘴裏發出一種似乎人們計算銅錢的聲音罷了。</p>
<p>在古老的住宅裏，夏季常發生蛇吃鼠的事。蛇以細長如繩索的身子，一圈一圈圍着老鼠。老鼠發出怪可憐的吱吱吱聲音。老鼠被蛇吞吃，人們見了，照理應該發生快感。但是因爲人們很怕蛇，所以看見蛇吃鼠，反而感覺恐懼，當做不祥之事了。</p>
<p>科學發達，病理學家證實了老鼠能傳染一種疫症，名爲「鼠疫」或「黑死病」；老鼠之爲人類公敵，更是罪加一等。於是，撲滅老鼠，便視爲必要舉措。捕捉老鼠的鐵絲籠，鐵夾子，以至藥死老鼠的磷膏等，不絕地！製出來。</p>
<p>上古時候，人們曾　　鼬來捉老鼠。鼬又　黃鼠狼，很會捉老鼠；不過牠也很愛偷鷄吃。鼬一面捉老鼠，一面偷鷄吃，在人們看來，功不足以掩罪。人們仔細一打算，就不再養鼬捉老鼠，而改養貓了。</p>
<p>在戰爭期間，人們對於糧食，特別珍惜；因此，對於老鼠也就更加敵視。我們希望上海在禁止吐痰遵動之後，再來一個「滅鼠遵動」。</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 向家支</p>
<p>一二　後庭花</p>
<p>維城等陳家的老媽子走了，躊躇了一下。想着要是說國芳接到了我的信就趕回來，那是絕對不會這樣快。那麼國芳是本來要回來的了，她爲什麼不等明天回來後天回來；明天後天回來，黃龍是在這裏了。我假定現在就應召而去，據老媽子說，不是還有個朱小姐在她家裏嗎。維城在屋子裏踱過來踱過去，一會兒反剪着手，一會兒把兩手撑在桌子上。他要首先決定的，是對付國芳的態度，他想了好久，幾乎不願意再住在王順興客棧裏，只願意把脖子一縮，立刻回到家裏，只當不知道國芳曾經回到雙橋來，後來把桌子一拍，猛然想起了自己對黃龍說過的話，黃龍笑我只有這隻手舉得起來殺仇人的兒子，却舉不起那隻手來殺仇人的女兒。我當時是怎麼說的，維城一想到這裏，立即鼓起了一般勇氣，把黃龍藏在褥子底下的那柄刀抽出來，揑在手裏試了一試，往後退走幾小，望準了牀沿，遠遠的擲過去。這一擲，倘然出之於黃龍，那還用說得，一定入木三分，刀柄在牀沿上，搖搖擺擺像風前的楊柳一般；現在維城一擲，可離開目已的期望太遠了，刀子和牀沿，一些不發生關係，只豁珢琅的掉在地下，王瘋子在門外問道：「葉先生，什麼東西掉下來了？」</p>
<p>維城在想着，要是再不上陳家去，陳家老媽子又要來了，他懷着那柄刀，付了王瘋子五十塊錢做房飯錢，在暮色蒼茫中，走出客棧。他抿了抿嘴，裝出一副自己覺得是笑容，踏上大街。起先是走着通常的步子，後來慢慢的慢下來。看見雙橋鎭上的店鋪，都還是一派新年氣象，紅紙上寫着黑字隱隱的看得出來。再一看，兩株大楡樹，是顯現在前面，這是陳國芳的家了。他那顆心幾乎要從口腔裏吐出來，突然的，他向後轉，狂奔了。（二四八）</p>
<h3>高黎貢山脈神兵訪問記（二）</h3>
<p>— 潔風譯</p>
<p>（原載十二月六日肩頭賣報知）</p>
<p>大本營陸軍報道部派遣讀賣報知社記者　佐野康（寄自中緬國境某地）</p>
<p>在雲南第一綫的塹壕里</p>
<p>在此友軍陣地上，有標尚五千二百英尺的松林，白色和黃色的高山植物，在朝風下面，可憐地搖擺着。塹壕後面，建有許多簡陋的小屋。這是廚房而兼食堂，食堂而又兼休息室的士兵小舍。和小舍毘鄰，沒有鷄棚，猪棚，在鷄棚的鐵絲和小舍的傾斜的屋　上，還有許多紅柿子在晒着。</p>
<p>「打這樣的仗，還要叫國內的人不安，那是太說不過去了。我們現在在第一綫上，就在行着這樣的現地自給。養鷄，養猪，也是爲着這個目的才養的。到正月初一，我們打算開開殺戒，大吃一頓呢！」</p>
<p>在「燒飯當番」的兵士，這樣笑着說。</p>
<p>此外，陣地上還造了許多運動器械以及遊動圓木之類。據說，這是退治惡疫的唯一妙法。</p>
<p>在自六月起，到十月初爲止的雨季中，兵士們是不大吃得着蔬菜的。有時，只好拿雁來紅和南瓜的蔓藤充飢。但是他們不發一聲怨言，仍在頑强奮戰着。問起他們呢，那麼—</p>
<p>「國內都很振作麼？四月十八日的美機空襲到底怎麼樣？」反來復去，總是這二個問題。對這二點，我這樣地回答他們：</p>
<p>「就算打着這樣的大仗，國內還是處之泰然的。日本的國民生活，非常豐厚。四月十八日的美機空襲也算不了一回事。飛機師被俘，給了嚴重的處分。敵人的游擊性神經戰，相反地，只造成了逆效果。現在，大家都興奮起來，衆口一辭地都在說：空襲有什麼可怕呀！」</p>
<p>之後，我又給他們講了二則故事：一是某僕役手持燒夷彈，奮勇殺敵；一是某老婆婆用飯桶救滅了燒夷彈。兵士們聽　，都「了不得，了不得」那麼地喊着，雀躍起來。部隊長又說道：</p>
<p>「這里，我叫牠作高天原。踞高臨下，雲霓在望，這里簡直可說是天國。就日常生活言，雖感種種不便，但是敵人就在眼前，我們永遠抱着向戰的希望，和烈烈的鬬志，在這些希望和鬬志之前，區區生活上的不自由簡直是値不得提的。據說有日　雲霞爲伍的辟毅仙人，我們站在第一綫上的人，爲烈烈的「鬬魂」鼓舞着，就近乎那個樣子。所以，在第一綫上，是無足掛慮的，我們第一綫將士的心願，永遠盼望後方的人振作，盼望他們過着溫暖豐裕的生活……</p>
<p>在這里，雲南的高天原，我見到的，就是這些決意支持大東亞戰爭的可敬佩的神兵之雄姿。</p>
<p>從仰光到最前綫</p>
<p>所謂滇緬公路，是指自雲南省之昆明以迄於緬甸之臘戍這段一千一百公里的汽車路而言。自臘戍到仰光，同樣一千一百公里之間，和鐵道綫路並行，也有平坦的舖裝路，滿載着援蔣物資的載貨車就在這上面通過。我先坐飛機自仰光飛到美妙，再坐火車從美妙到瓦城，從瓦域到臘戍，然後從臘戍再坐張着蓬的夜行載貨車到最前綫，經由畹町，芒市，龍陵等地，直達怒江的第一綫，踏盡了蜿蜒千五百餘公里的滇緬公路。在一個晴天的早上，飛機離了民加朗東飛機塲，下面看見的是代表「米之國緬甸的豐饒的田野。伊洛瓦底江在左面·再向北稍許，就到了白古，赤土和靑田，麻栗樹的密林，伊洛瓦底江像蜘蛛脚爪似的向四面八方爬開，那兒，滔滔地流着褐色的濁流。飛機在仰光上空向右轉，就到了美妙。這里，是海拔二千七百英尺的高原，酷熱的時候，緬甸央政廳總要從闌貢搬來這里辦公的。</p>
<p>到了美妙之後，換坐汽車，在滇緬公路上逆行六十八公里，才到達仰光。仰光這地方悽慘得很，觸目盡是焦土，紫荊等街樹業已全部焚燬。這是在我軍佔領之前，給中國放火隊縱火燒掉的。只有從前王城的附近，尙餘殘綠。護城河里的水，和仰光山上佛塔的尖頂，在點綴着這寂寞的廢墟。據說，焦土之後，這一帶地　都有惡疫流行着呢！　　本報原有副刊自由談，春秋，遊藝界三種，現已合併，改出綜合性質之自由談副刊一種，每日發刊，茲訂徵稿條例如下：</p>

<h3>Public Opinion</h3>
<p>The power of the people is the power that determines everything.</p>
<p>This is not only the essence of political theory in the new era, but also the highest principle of our Chinese political philosophy for thousands of years. From Mencius's "the people are the most important" and the theory of "heaven sees as the people see," to the advocacy of "people's rights" by the National Father, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, all of these are to awaken the attention of the court and the public to the decisive power of the people. The so-called "kingly way," in its ultimate pursuit, is still "starting anew with the people" in order to "gain the people to prosper." In this era of long-term war, we demand victory in this war. Whether it is the spiritual support, or the material assistance and replenishment, which one is not dependent on the people?</p>
<p>Therefore, we hope that our friendly nation, Japan, will further understand the significant role of Chinese public opinion in politics. The implementation of any policy or law must simultaneously observe the needs and trends of the current largest number of Chinese people, and then seek implementation methods that are appropriate to public opinion in order to achieve ideal results and ensure complete success. For example, in the current issue of people's food, the principles set by the authorities are not imperfect, and they also consider both the Chinese people and Sino-Japanese cooperation. According to theoretical estimates, it will definitely gain the approval and support of all parties. However, from the perspective of the actual situation, we deeply feel that it is still necessary to adapt to the sound methods of the majority of Chinese public opinion. Of course, the food issue is just one example, and other issues are the same. Principles alone are not enough; there must also be methods, and the center of the method is to adapt to the majority of Chinese public opinion.</p>
<p>Translated commentary</p>
<h3>Shattering America's Deception - December 15th "Asahi Shimbun" Editorial</h3>
<p>The talk of postwar order is perhaps most verbose from the United States. However, whether this so-called postwar order is correct or not is self-evident.</p>
<p>Last year, on October 1st, US Secretary of the Navy Knox advocated that the US and British navies should cooperate to maintain maritime security around the world. This means that the US and Britain want to use force to monitor the world order; they act as the chief of police and use force to suppress those who go against their will. This claim, even within the United States, has provoked opposition from the majority, but they have appointed themselves as the supervisors and police chiefs of world security and order. This attitude has only become more persistent over time.</p>
<p>This American world policy, as the Americans themselves point out: First, it is a kind of ambition that exceeds the strength of the US and Britain; second, this oppressive, condescending attitude, on the contrary, may arouse the resentment of other countries. Regarding the first point, if implemented according to the American method, the US and Britain want to establish a new system that covers the entire world; as a pipe dream? No matter how large this plan is, it is impossible to put it into practice with the power of two or three countries. Furthermore, it is even more outrageous for these two or three countries to force other countries to comply with their own will. It is precisely this wrong method of promoting the establishment of a new order, and their arrogant attitude, that has become the cause of disrupting peace. The outbreak of this Greater East Asia War also stems from this.</p>
<p>Secondly, what exactly is the peace that the United States is trying to achieve? Roosevelt talked about the Four Freedoms—that is, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from want, and freedom from fear. Peace must be based on justice, which goes without saying. How can they achieve the Four Freedoms when they fundamentally lack this premise? Secretary of State Hull advocated the establishment of coordination on the condition of reciprocal trade. Expelling Orientals from their own country, desperately abusing blacks domestically, and using high tariffs to exclude foreign goods, while engaging in plunder in Central and South America with all their might—what is particularly shameful is that, due to selfishness, they have repeatedly brought international economic conferences to bankruptcy: how can such an America now sing the tune of coordination on the condition of reciprocal trade? Doesn't this seem like the devil chanting Buddhist scriptures?</p>
<p>The new system that the United States is trying to achieve, relying solely on a few empty words from the leaders, I believe will not succeed in the end. Their intentions, just as they are now very concretely and clearly unfolding in the relationship between the Pan-American countries in the Western Hemisphere, are to complete the so-called extreme aggression of pursuing profit only. In the Western Hemisphere, what exactly is the coordination organization that has been promoted in the past and present? That is Roosevelt's Big Stick Diplomacy, Knox's Dollar Diplomacy...etc., an extremely aggressive policy that the countries of Central and South America have already experienced. In short, it is nothing more than imperialism disguised by the mask of democracy. {At present, Roosevelt has written the four characters "Good Neighbor Policy" in large letters on the signboard, but later, his true colors will eventually be revealed. Now, aren't the ABC countries of South America, as well as Mexico in Central America, already attacking the American international coordination organization as a group? In short, judging from the current international organization in the Western Hemisphere, the so-called world policy of the United States is something that makes all related countries, except for the United States, frown; that is, it is the so-called "Roman conquest" where only the United States can be satisfied, and all other countries will suffer.</p>
<p>A year has passed quickly since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. This war was caused precisely by the United States' attitude of self-righteousness.</p>
<p>However, under the wise strategy and brave battles of the Imperial Army soldiers, and the united efforts of one hundred million people, we are daringly carrying out a solemn punishment against American hegemony. This is not only related to the fate of one corner of Greater East Asia. Even the countries of Central and South America, which are groaning under the American selfish policy of control, will surely easily understand Japan's true intentions and place great expectations on Japan. Here, we hope to thoroughly shatter America's deception. All the one hundred million people of East Asia must understand: the road that Japan is taking at the moment is how close it is to the right path, and how full it is of the light of justice.

<h3>The Propaganda Department Issues a Communiqué: Chairman Wang Leaves Nanjing for Japan; Many High-Ranking Officials from Various Yuan and Departments Accompany Him; Arrived Safely in Tokyo Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency): The Propaganda Department issued a communiqué (released at 3:00 PM on December 20th): The National Government Chairman and concurrently President of the Executive Yuan left Nanjing at 10:00 AM on the 19th to go to Japan. At 1:50 PM on the 20th, they arrived at Haneda Airport in Tokyo. On the 22nd, they will pay a visit to the Japanese Emperor in their capacity as Chairman of the National Government. After the 23rd, they will hold talks with Prime Minister Tojo and other Japanese government authorities in their capacity as President of the Executive Yuan on various issues concerning close Sino-Japanese cooperation. Those accompanying him include Zhou Fohai, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and concurrently Minister of Finance; Chu Minyi, Minister of Foreign Affairs; Mei Shiping, Minister of Industry; Lin Baisheng, Minister of Propaganda; Xiao Shuxuan, President of the Military Advisory Council, and others.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency): The Japanese Information Bureau announced at 1:30 PM on the 20th: Wang Jingwei, Chairman of the National Government of the Republic of China and concurrently President of the Executive Yuan, in order to express congratulations to the Empire on the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War for its brilliant war results, and to seek closer Sino-Japanese cooperation, and to consult with our country's authorities, specially departed from Nanjing on December 19th on the special Haiyan plane and arrived at Haneda Airport at 1:50 PM on the 20th. It is scheduled to visit the Emperor on the 22nd in the capacity of Chairman of the National Government, and to hold talks with the Prime Minister and other officials on the 23rd in the capacity of President of the Executive Yuan. In addition to the President, the entourage also includes Minister of Foreign Affairs Chu Minyi, Minister of Finance Zhou Fohai, President of the Military Advisory Council and Army General Xiao Shuxuan, Minister of Industry Mei Shiping, Minister of Propaganda Lin Baisheng, and others.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency): At this time when the Greater East Asia War is winning victories one after another, and the Axis countries of East Asia and even the world have laid the foundation for victory, Chairman Wang, in order to obtain further cooperation with the Japanese government, to strengthen the National Government, to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War, and to complete the construction of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, decided to travel to Japan in addition to his busy political affairs, in order to discuss specific plans with the Japanese authorities, strengthen the National Government, and seek the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. At 10:00 AM on the 19th, he specially accompanied Minister Zhou Fohai, Minister Chu Minyi, Minister Mei Enping, Minister Lin Baisheng, President of the Military Advisory Council Xiao Shuyi, Vice Minister Zhou Jiangxiang, Supreme Economic Advisor Ishikawa, Supreme Military Advisor Matsui, Naval Advisor Teraoka, and others to fly to Japan by plane. Japanese Ambassador to China Shigemitsu also traveled with them. The heads of various Yuan, Departments, and Commissions who came to the airport to see them off included Chen Qun, Ding Mocun, Chen Chunpu, Chen Junhui, Luo Junqiang, Zhou Xuechang, Xu Suzhou, Cai Pei, Tang Mang, Ye Peng, Deng Zuyu, and others. On the foreign side, Ambassador to Manchukuo Lu Ronghuan, German Ambassador Stoyanov, Italian Ambassador Graziani, Japanese envoys and consuls from various places, totaling more than 100 people, arrived. At exactly 10:00, the Chairman, wearing a black suit and looking radiant, slowly boarded the plane amidst the resounding military music. Various members of his entourage, Zhou Fohai, Chu Minyi, Zhou Longxiang, Ishikawa, Matsui, and Advisor Teraoka, followed one after another into the Chairman's special plane. Ambassador Shigemitsu, Minister Mei, Minister Lin, and Military Attaché Daigu of Ambassador Shigemitsu's entourage, etc., traveled on another plane. At 10:05, the plane started up. The Chairman and members of his entourage, including Minister Chu, waved goodbye to those seeing them off. All those seeing them off also took off their hats in salute. The atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. Only after the Chairman's special plane and Ambassador Shigemitsu's plane flew into the distant sky did those seeing them off leave the scene and return.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency): The Executive Yuan of the National Government, with the President concurrently as the President, arrived here by plane in the afternoon of the 20th. That evening, they lodged at the Guest House in Azabu District. It is scheduled to go to the residence of Minister Aoki of Greater East Asia at 1:00 PM on the 21st to attend the informal banquet hosted by Minister Aoki of Greater East Asia. Then, in the afternoon of the same day, they will visit Prime Minister Tojo.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency): According to observations from various aspects obtained here, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government has cooperated with Japan in the spirit of sharing joys and sorrows, in order to complete the great cause of East Asia. Now, as the Greater East Asia War enters its second year, in order to cope with the current situation, it has been decided to further cooperate with Japan. Because if the Sino-Japanese problem is not resolved, then the Greater East Asia War will be difficult to complete. This time, Chairman of the National Government and concurrently President of the Executive Yuan Wang, accompanied by government officials such as Chu Minyi, Zhou Fohai, Mei Shiping, and Lin Baisheng, has once again gone to Japan. Its significance is extremely profound. Sino-Japanese friendly relations will surely become closer from now on. It has been a year and a half since Chairman Wang visited Japan in late June of last year. During this period, when the Greater East Asia War broke out, Chairman Wang immediately issued a statement, stating that the National Government had decided to follow the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty and the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration, sharing joys and sorrows with Japan. After that, there was Ambassador Chu's special visit to Japan, and the return visits of the three special envoys of Japan, Hiranuma, Arita, and Nagai. The diplomatic relations between the two countries have already become closer. Previously, on the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, Chairman Wang also strongly stated that the National Government would further cooperate with Japan. Therefore, it is expected that after Chairman Wang's visit to Japan, the cooperation between China and Japan will surely have a leap forward development.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency): Chairman of the National Government and concurrently President of the Executive Yuan Wang, accompanied by Minister of Foreign Affairs Chu and more than a dozen members of his entourage, took off from Nanjing on the Haiyan special plane and a specially prepared plane at 10:10 on the 19th. They arrived in Fukuoka at 8:27 PM on the same day. At 10:13 AM on the 20th, they took off again and arrived safely at Haneda Airport here at 1:50 PM in the afternoon. Those who came to the airport to welcome them included Ambassador to Japan Xu Liang, embassy staff, Prime Minister Tojo, Minister of the Navy Shimada, Minister of Foreign Affairs Tani, Minister Aoki of Greater East Asia, Minister of Finance Kaya, President of the Yokusankai Abe, and ambassadors from various countries, including the ambassador to Manchukuo. At 1:40 PM, the shadow of the plane was seen appearing in the western sky. The loudspeaker specially placed inside the airport immediately reported, "Chairman Wang's special plane, the Haiyan, has appeared in the western sky." Upon hearing the sound, those who were welcoming at the scene all looked west, and saw the Haiyan, with its deep green body, flying leisurely, circling over the airport once before landing. The time was 1:50 PM. Then, the door of the plane was seen opening, and the Chairman, wearing a black suit and looking radiant, slowly disembarked. Yoshioka, the third section chief of the Protocol Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, immediately stepped forward to guide him. Ambassador Xu also stepped forward to greet the Chairman, inquire about the safety of his journey, and introduce Minister of Foreign Affairs Tani. Following the Chairman's special plane, the specially prepared plane landed, carrying Minister of Foreign Affairs Chu, Minister of Finance Zhou, President of the Military Advisory Council Xiao Shuyi, Minister of Industry Mei Shiping, Minister of Propaganda Lin Baisheng, and other important officials of the National Government, as well as Economic Advisor Ishikawa, Military Advisor Matsui, and Naval Rear Admiral Teraoka, who were traveling with them.

<h3>General Rommel's Troops Move Towards Nofilia; Reach Favorable Terrain to Buy Time; British Encirclement Plan Has Been Shattered</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 20th (Domei News Agency): According to reports received here from the Axis side, General Rommel's troops, after inflicting blows on the British army, have left Sid and are now moving towards Nofilia, having reached favorable terrain to buy time. According to Berlin Radio, the vanguard of the British army, which had taken encirclement action, had reached the coastal avenue and traveled far. Rommel's rearguard, after resting for a long time, rose up to attack and inflicted heavy damage. It seemed that the British infantry was waiting for the tanks to arrive before acting again on this coastal avenue. Berlin solemnly stated that Rommel had shattered the British army's plan to encircle the German army. In Tunisia, there were only small contacts between the two sides, while the Axis air force continued to attack the Allied fortifications.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Haitong News Agency): Regarding the news reported by London Radio that the German-Italian armored vehicle team under Marshal Rommel in North Africa had been cut into sections and that most of the North African army had been surrounded, Berlin sources stated last night that Rommel had shattered the British army's encirclement plan and captured many British prisoners of war. In addition, the captured German soldiers had been freed. Reuters, due to the facts, had to admit that the surrounded Axis army had escaped. Urged by Churchill, General Montgomery made every effort to attack the flanks of the German-Italian army, but was blocked by the Axis army's fierce artillery fire and vast minefields. In addition to heavy losses, the Allied army achieved nothing.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 19th (Havas News Agency): According to British and German telegrams, there was no change on the Tunisian front yesterday. German sources said that the weather improved slightly yesterday, and German aircraft went out to bomb British and American artillery positions, shooting down 18 British and American aircraft, including two four-engine bombers. According to news from the Allied headquarters in North Africa, there were only local battles on the entire Tunisian front yesterday, but the details have not been announced. In addition, the American side admitted that due to the lack of ships, it is temporarily difficult to fulfill its promise to provide economic aid to French North Africa. Medicines may be transported to North Africa in the coming months, but there are no ships available to transport food.</p>
<p>Tangier, 20th (Haitong News Agency): According to news heard here, a part of the French army in French Morocco that is loyal to General Pétain has joined the Moorish tribes to make armed resistance against the British and American invading forces. In addition, the French reserve army in Morocco refused to join the invaders' camp. Therefore, American propaganda agencies are making every effort to induce the French and natives of Morocco to join the Allied side. The authorities have issued appeals six times, requesting the French reserve army to join the British and American armies.</p>
<p>German Aircraft Attack Benghazi</p>
<p>Rome, 20th (Haitong News Agency): According to the Italian military headquarters, German aircraft attacked Benghazi, destroying two Allied cargo ships, totaling 12,000 tons.

<h3>Turkey and the Soviet Union Have Not Conducted Treaty Negotiations; Only Seeking to Remove Tensions; Turkish Ambassador to Germany Returns Home Via Bulgaria</h3>
<p>Ankara, 20th (Haitong News Agency): Turkish officials yesterday denied the rumors spread by the UK and the US that Turkey had signed a friendship treaty with the Soviet Union. It is said that since the Soviet defendants in the case of the assassination of the German Ambassador to Turkey von Papen have been questioned, Turkey and the Soviet Union are still trying to remove the tension between the two. It is understood that the Soviet Union, in order to be consistent with the policies of the UK and the US, will soon issue a statement in the south to express its friendship to Turkey.</p>
<p>Ankara, 20th (Haitong News Agency): Officials here announced that Turkish Ambassador to Germany Ali Khan returned to Istanbul by car from Bulgaria on the 17th, and is expected to arrive here tomorrow.

<h3>Japan-Thailand Alliance Anniversary; Tsubogami Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 20th (Central News Agency): The 21st is the anniversary of the establishment of the Japan-Thailand Offensive and Defensive Alliance. Japanese Ambassador to Thailand Tsubogami delivered a speech on the 20th and said that the conclusion of the offensive and defensive alliance between Japan and Thailand was by no means accidental. Looking back on the past relations between the two countries, it can be seen that the authorities of the two countries had long had the determination to cooperate between the two countries. However, due to the obstruction of the UK and the US, they could not make a clear announcement. But the hearts of the two countries were filled with enthusiasm. Once it was made public, there would be rapid progress. Looking back on the past year, the people of Japan and Thailand have fought side by side and shared weal and woe. When the Japanese army attacked Malaya and Burma, the Thai government assumed important responsibilities, such as ensuring the rear supply line and providing operational bases. At the same time, the Thai army also responded to the Japanese army's attack on Burma. In addition to assisting Japan militarily, the Thai government also exported a large amount of grain to solve Japan's food problem. In order to resolve Thailand's currency insecurity, Japan also provided Thailand with a loan of 200 million yen. As a result, Japan and Thailand have achieved practical cooperation in financial relations. In order to seek cultural cooperation and restore the inherent culture of East Asia, the governments of the two countries signed a cultural agreement. All of these facts are sufficient to prove that the relationship between Japan and Thailand has become closer, and cannot be shaken by any false propaganda. Looking back on the past year, the Japanese army has been invincible and has won every battle, and has already secured the key to final victory. At the same time, the UK and the US have been defeated again and again. However, the Japanese people are not satisfied with the victories they have obtained. The goal of Japan's operations is to strive for final victory. It will not stop fighting unless the UK and the US are subdued. Therefore, the war in the past year is only the prelude to the war. Today, the people of Japan and Thailand should be aware and sacrifice everything to strive for final victory. If the people of the two countries can thoroughly realize this, the alliance will surely have a leap forward development, and the final victory can be completed as a result.</p>

<p>Haitong News Agency Dispatch from Berlin, December 20th: Fierce battles continue on the Eastern Front, especially in the southern sector. Between the Don and Volga rivers, German-Romanian forces continue to advance, and enemy counterattacks have been repelled, with the enemy losing many tanks.

<h3>Spanish Foreign Minister and Portuguese Prime Minister Meet, Aiming to Maintain Neutrality Jointly; Spanish Economic Delegation Also to Visit Portugal</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, December 20th: Spanish Foreign Minister Jordana arrived here on the afternoon of the 18th and visited Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar on the 19th, and plans to meet with Portuguese President Carmona. Portuguese newspapers have strongly promoted this event.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, December 20th: It has been learned from sources here that Spanish Foreign Minister Jordana and Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar have begun their talks yesterday morning. Jordana left his residence at 10:00 AM yesterday to visit Salazar at the Palácio de São Bento, and left at 11:35 AM with the Spanish Ambassador to Portugal, Franco Nogueiras. Responsible parties here have declined to comment on the various rumors circulating about Jordana's visit to Portugal, stating only that Jordana's trip to Lisbon is merely a return visit for Salazar's visit to Spain earlier this spring. Officials here refuted the claim that a Spanish Second Military Delegation would soon arrive in Lisbon, admitting only that Spain may send an economic delegation to Portugal.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, December 20th: Portuguese President Carmona hosted a banquet yesterday for Spanish Foreign Minister Jordana, declaring that Jordana is not only a representative of the Spanish government but also a representative of the people. The friendly relations between Spain and Portugal have not been destroyed by international disputes, and Jordana's visit will surely strengthen friendly relations and lead to closer understanding. In his reply, Jordana emphasized that the friendly relations between Spain and Portugal are increasingly enhanced by a common mission, which is also the responsibility of countries hoping to maintain Western civilization. Jordana hoped that this visit would demonstrate the friendly relations and unity between Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, December 20th: It is declared here that Spanish Foreign Minister Jordana will not hold political discussions with Portuguese authorities tomorrow.

<p>Consensus May Be Reached on Preventing the Expansion of the Battlefield</p>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, December 20th: Spanish Foreign Minister Jordana, accompanied by twelve staff members, arrived here on the afternoon of the 18th and is scheduled to stay until the 21st, holding separate talks with Portuguese President and Prime Minister Salazar. At a time when the North African war is underway and the movements of Spain and Portugal are attracting worldwide attention, the importance of these talks is self-evident. Spanish Foreign Minister Jordana's visit to Portugal is ostensibly a return visit for the Portuguese-Spanish talks in February of this year, but after meeting with the Portuguese President, the Spanish Foreign Minister will thoroughly exchange views with Prime Minister Salazar, discuss jointly maintaining the two countries' neutrality policies, and discuss current urgent issues, and seek to establish a common stance to prevent the expansion of the war. When British and American forces entered North Africa, Spain and Portugal received guarantees from both warring parties to maintain their neutrality and territorial integrity. However, while the situation in North Africa has not yet come to an end, it is also necessary to determine a common countermeasure to prevent any eventuality. However, Spain still insists on maintaining a friendly non-belligerent stance toward the Axis powers, which is in direct contrast to Portugal's fundamental national policy of protecting its African colonies and seeking the understanding of the United Kingdom and the United States. Therefore, the two countries' foreign policies are too subjective and are actually a point of contention. However, on the point of preventing the expansion of the battlefield, the two countries can naturally reach a consensus. It is generally observed that the two countries may take the opportunity of the talks to agree on joint military action by the two countries when necessary.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, December 20th: According to political circles in Lisbon, the Spanish government decided to send Foreign Minister Jordana to Lisbon for a visit only three weeks ago, which is sufficient to prove that recent developments in North Africa have made Spain have a desire to discuss relevant issues with Portugal. Spain's concern about Spanish Morocco has been exacerbated by the visit of former Spanish Prime Minister Negrín to North Africa, as Negrín has been vigorously advocating for the actions taken by the United Kingdom and the United States in Spain over the past year. The Portuguese side is also very concerned about Negrín's statement, as Portugal has always opposed communist activities. According to the narrow views of political figures in Lisbon, the issues discussed by the Spanish Foreign Minister and Portuguese politicians will be nothing more than the expansion of the North African war, the negotiations between the United States and Negrín, and the intensification of communist propaganda activities on the Iberian Peninsula.</p>

<h3>Waste of Materials: Striving on One Hand, Wasting on the Other; Next Year's Budget Difficult to Draft</h3>
<p>The opposite of thrift is waste. If an individual wastes energy, their health will suffer. If they waste money, their finances will be in disarray. If a country wastes materials, its resources will become insufficient. Conversely, if waste is exchanged for thrift, the opposite result will naturally be obtained.</p>
<p>The outcome of modern warfare depends on the sustainability of the rise and fall of material resources on both sides of the conflict. Since the Sino-Japanese Incident, the Chongqing regime's advocacy of "economic warfare," "three parts politics, seven parts economy," and other statements are all conclusions that emphasize materials. Recently, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs of Chongqing have further sought to acquire materials, formulated the "Wartime Management of Import and Export Goods Regulations," and abolished all previously promulgated restrictions. The standard for imported goods is not "enemy" or "friend"; all military and daily necessities are generally permitted. In addition, the regime has ordered all provinces to implement "material grabbing," distributing US dollar bonds and savings bonds to provinces for promotion, with the proceeds used to grab materials. It can be said that it has exhausted the means of "striving" and "grabbing," and it can also be said that it has fully revealed its predicament.</p>
<p>However, the Chongqing regime's measures are often a flash in the pan, or the law is abandoned by lawmakers, or played by those in power. Speaking of thrift, although there is no explicit legal provision, it is an obligation that everyone should have in this era, especially the public should take precedence over the private. Because private thrift is sometimes driven by the concept of self-interest and is easy to implement, and most people's lives are already on the verge of the hunger line, there is nothing to save. The most important thing to strive for is the public. Public officials do not need to pay for public goods themselves, so they do not know how to cherish or take care of them, and they arbitrarily damage or discard them. Especially when air raids are frequent, they are slightly damaged by tremors, and they are discarded and replenished, which wastes a lot of money. The attitude towards spending money on household and institutional supplies is completely different. For example, the stationery of rear-area civil servants is equivalent to the guns of front-line soldiers. Soldiers are punished for losing their guns, but rear-area civil servants can arbitrarily lose the stationery they use without any responsibility. Although it is a matter of a small amount of ink, a seal mud, or a pen nib, the accumulation of small amounts adds up to a large expense. Someone once said that the loss of stationery by civil servants should be treated the same as the loss of guns by soldiers. In terms of responsibility, it does not seem to be an exaggeration.</p>
<p>When the Soviet Union implemented its five-year plan for national construction, the whole country tightened its belts, endured all the inconveniences of life, in order to establish a solid foundation for the national economy. Germany is a victorious country in Europe, but every German, rich or poor, lives a wartime thrifty life in the country. Beef and white bread are not easy to see. Daily sundries are distributed in fixed quantities. The country's material conditions allow for a certain amount of enjoyment, and you can only get that much. If you want to exceed the prescribed amount, you cannot buy it no matter how much money you have. Looking back at the current environment of the Chongqing regime, the international routes have been blocked one after another, and the source of materials has been suddenly cut off. There are few ways to open up sources, and on the other hand, there are too many redundant institutions, and civil servants, especially the ruling class, indulge in waste without any sense of public morality or responsibility. This means that it is impossible to talk about reducing expenditure. Under such an atmosphere, how can the effect of "striving for" and "grabbing" materials be truly achieved? Even if some are "grabbed" and "strived for," isn't it still the same waste? Since it does not have the conditions for the sustainable rise and fall of material resources, how can it obtain the favorable results of a protracted war?</p>
<h3>Overview of Resource Development in North China, Translated from the December 11, 1942, "Osaka News"</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the economic progress of the Northeast has been remarkable in all aspects, especially in the development of heavy industry.</p>
<p>Iron Ore: In July 1939, the Mengjiang United Committee and the North China Development Company each contributed half of the capital of 20 million Japanese yen to establish the Longyan Iron and Steel Co., Ltd., which became the center of development. The company's mining areas are located in Yihua, Huailai, and Longguan counties, including Yanshan, Pangjiabao, Zhuolu, and Sanchakou. Initially, the focus was on developing the Yantongshan mining area, with the Pangjiabao mining area as an adjunct. After the completion of the Jingbao Line from Yihua Station to Pangjiabao Railway (i.e., the Pangjia Line), the amount of steel output to Japan from Pangjiabao has gradually increased and surpassed that of Manchuria. The company's specialization has gradually developed. As of April of this year, the capital increased to 60 million Japanese yen, and it is now determined to increase production and seek development. In addition, there is the Shanxi Iron Mining Plant, which is jointly funded by the North China Development Company and the Okura Iron Industry Company, which is also engaged in mining the Dongshan, Yixiang, and Ningwu iron mountains, among which the Yixiang Iron Mountain is the most promising, with estimated reserves of 1.2 million tons, and is currently accelerating mining.</p>
<p>Iron and Steel Industry: There are three iron and steel companies: the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in Hebei Province, the Taiyuan Iron Factory in Shanxi Province, and the Yangquan Iron Factory. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant transports ore from Longyan, while the Taiyuan and Yangquan factories transport ore from Dongshan, Yixiang, and Ningwu, and each produces pig iron and steel materials. In order to improve management and expand production, the Shanxi and Yangquan iron factories were jointly funded in April of this year by thirteen Japanese companies in China centered on the North China Development Company to establish Shanxi Industry Co., Ltd. for management and operation.</p>
<p>Coal: Coal is the largest resource in North China in terms of both quantity and quality. It is currently the center of industrial development in North China. The establishment of transportation and communication agencies, power generation plans, and the distribution of resource funds are all prioritized due to the development of coal mines. The main coal mines are Datong, Jingxing, Zhongxing, Jiaozuo, Liuquan, Shanxi, and Cixian. The Datong coal mine has increased its production by 4 million tons. In January 1940, the Datong Coal Mine Co., Ltd. was jointly funded by the North China Development Company, the South Manchuria Railway Company, and the Mengjiang government to operate and mine the coal mine. The Jingxing coal mine is operated and mined by the Sino-Japanese joint venture Jingxing Coal Mine Company. The company was founded in July 1940 and now also operates the coal mine west of Liuhegou. A powder factory has been established in Shimen to refine coking coal using the coal produced by the mine. The Zhongxing, Jiaozuo, Liuquan, Shanxi, and Cixian coal mines have been jointly operated since November 1940 and are managed by the Japanese military. The capital of each mine is either solely funded by the North China Development Company or jointly funded by the company and other Japanese companies by agreement. Among them, the Zhongxing coal mine has the largest coal output of the coal mines currently managed by the military. Its coal is a sticky coking coal with a calorific value of over 8,000 calories, making it the most suitable for iron making among the coal produced in North China. In addition, Liuquan coal has recently attracted much attention due to its suitability for low-temperature dry distillation, and its production performance is very good, and this year will exceed the planned quantity. In addition, the coal mines in Shandong Province have also been actively developed for a year.</p>
<p>Salt: Regarding salt, there have been several salt production increase plans recently. The development of Changlu Salt and Shandong Salt is now underway. As a result, Japan's dependence on distant sea salt has been transformed into dependence on near-sea salt, and its salt production has become a supply source for Japanese raw materials. In August 1939, the North China Development Company invested 18.75 million Japanese yen, and the North China Political Affairs Commission invested 6.25 million Japanese yen, totaling 25 million Japanese yen in capital, to establish the North China Salt Industry Co., Ltd. to operate and develop salt production and refining. The long-abandoned salt fields and the folk salt fields with extremely immature manual salt-making technology and extremely low production have also been completely renewed since the establishment of the company due to the expansion of salt fields and the improvement of technology. As for Shandong Salt, it was originally monopolized by Shandong Salt Industry Co., Ltd., which was established in February 1937 with a capital of 1 million Japanese yen. In March 1938, Mitsui Bussan Co., Ltd. and Mitsubishi Corporation joined the operation, and the capital increased to 10 million Japanese yen. In June 1941, the North China Development Company transferred 60,000 shares, so the company's operations also came under the North China Development Company, greatly increasing production and strengthening support for Japan.</p>
<p>Other Resources: In addition to the development of the above-mentioned resources such as iron, coal, and salt, the increase in production of agricultural products such as cotton and wheat is also very active. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan's economic base in North China has been used to drive out the forces of the United States and the United Kingdom, and its importance has become increasingly self-evident. On the other hand, North China can no longer remain a mere supplier of raw materials as before. In terms of processed products, it has almost reached the point where most of them no longer need to be supplied by Japan. In other words, North China has recently reached the point where it is becoming increasingly established in its self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>Future Hopes: Since 1942, North China has entered the program of the second five-year plan. The goal of this plan is to establish a raw material refining industry centered on iron, coal, and salt five years later, so that North China will leap from a position as a raw material supply area to an industrial manufacturing area. In addition, in order to increase food production and establish the self-sufficiency of the Hebei economy, water conservancy has been thoroughly improved this year. It is planned that from February of this year to March of next year, a total of 200,000 irrigation canals will be built in various parts of Hebei, including 2,000 in Beijing, 3,000 in Tianjin, 20,000 in Baoding, 60,000 in Shimen, 45,000 in Handan, 35,000 in Shandong, 15,000 in Kaifeng, 15,000 in Shanxi, and 5,000 in other areas. It has been completed in Hebei Province by 90%, Shandong Province by 70%, Shanxi Province by 100%, and Henan Province by 65%, which is a good result. It is expected that it will be completed by the scheduled date of March next year. (Translated by Ding)</p>

<h3>Field Communication: Special Correspondent from Hinode (Sent from the Yunnan Front Lines on the 12th)</h3>
<p>Chiang's army, consisting of ten divisions and 150,000 troops, using the Nu Mountain Plateau as a stronghold, are watching intently, constantly seeking an opportunity to retake the Yunnan-Burma Highway. Our XX unit remains vigilant and prepared to shed our last drop of blood in the frozen land. On the third anniversary of this great war, with vast stretches of mist and smoke, they sent their sentiments to their fathers and elders in their homeland:</p>
<p>Part One</p>
<p>"It is unacceptable to call this hardship and sigh with complaint. Look at the enemy; they are also human, and they are suffering as well. The one who can overcome this hardship is the victor of the war. Not only should the soldiers on the front lines think this way, but also the people in the rear should have this understanding," said the XX Unit Commander. "What I hope to convey to the people in the rear is this point." On the face of this stern commander, unwavering determination shone.</p>
<p>The Chongqing army under Luo Zhuoying, which fled from northern Burma to India, mostly lay exposed in the fields, dying from the Black Death and cholera. The survivors are looked upon with disdain by the American and British armies, living as unwanted and superfluous burdens in a state of despair. The reality is such, yet they continue to promote it as the second front in Asia, which is truly the height of absurdity. Since we ravaged the Yunnan-Burma Highway in May, we have received much intelligence that the enemy is planning to secure the India Highway. It is believed that aid to Chiang includes not only weapons and fuel. Since we are aware that a century-long war is unavoidable, Chiang Kai-shek is also loudly calling for the necessity of resisting Japan and saving the nation. He has gathered many military supply factories around Chongqing, using "leap in production" as a slogan to encourage a leap in military supply production capacity. Therefore, the transportation of machine tools and equipment is something we absolutely cannot ignore. When the Yuan Dynasty invaded, our ancestors continued the war to destroy the enemy for twenty-nine long years, shedding an unknown amount of brave blood to barely prolong the nation's fate. We too must share this blood debt; we must fight to the end.</p>
<p>The XX Unit Commander said, "The soldiers are single-mindedly focused on flattening the Kunlun Mountains."</p>
<p>Part Two</p>
<p>An excerpt from a letter from a soldier to his younger brother in his hometown: Many words from the ancients are worth savoring. For example, "Stay long enough and you will become attached to the place." Having arrived here, at the barren and desolate Yunnan front lines, the saying "Stay long enough and you will become attached to the place" has become a reality. We are only interested in two things: killing the enemy and eating. The soldiers' favorite foods are walnuts, persimmons, chestnuts, yams, bananas, as well as mountain doves and wild rabbits. Each carries a taste of home, warming us from the tip of our tongues to the walls of our stomachs. I wanted to write this homesickness in a letter to send back, but looking up, I saw wild geese calling as they flew across the sky, so I entrusted this field communication to the wild geese. What do you think?</p>
<p>One comrade wrote the following few lines of poetry: Night dew falls on the eaves of the tent,</p>
<p>Dreaming of a grand entry into Chongqing on fog-laden streets,</p>
<p>The soldiers are dozing,</p>
<p>Brother, this Chinese mainland, where ten thousand heroic souls slumber, is precisely where we will bury our bones. A few days ago, the captured plainclothes unit included a sixteen-year-old boy, a fair-skinned child about your age. This young plainclothes member was captured at night while trying to cross the Nu River on a raft. In his pocket, he had two hand grenades. He answered our interrogation by saying, "For Chairman Chiang, I am prepared to die at any time." He said it decisively and then said nothing more. Think about it, there are many, many such young people in China.</p>
<p>However, there are also such things. An enemy deputy regimental commander named Zhang Gongzhong (lieutenant colonel rank) had a map in his bag, but he only had bundles of banknotes, which amounted to 30,000 yuan. After most of his regiment was annihilated, Zhang Zhongzuo received the salary for his regiment of two thousand men and openly embezzled a thousand men's worth into his private pocket. He confessed this without any sense of shame.</p>
<p>How foolish it is for Chinese soldiers to fight to the death under these corrupt officers. However, there are even more cunning cadres. According to prisoners, an enemy fifth army translator named Yang Zilong shed tears of sorrow and shook his fist towards Chongqing, saying, "Do you know why Soong Mei-ling went to America? It is because Chiang Kai-shek and his accomplices embezzled military funds and deposited them in American banks to calculate how much interest they would earn before they withdrew them. Also, because the war of resistance is becoming increasingly difficult, they want to buy more property abroad as soon as possible so that they can easily escape after stepping down from office. However, the extremely ignorant Chongqing army's soldiers are still kept in the dark and do not know this."</p>
<p>We felt that Yang Translator was too pitiful, so we did not continue the conversation. Brother, being in this corner of Yunnan, from which one can see the heart and lungs of Chongqing, and seeing through the many tricks of the Chiang regime's front and back stages, is such an interesting thing. In my next letter, I may report to you on many things inside Chiang's official residence in Chongqing. (Original article published in the Asahi Shimbun (Central China Edition) on December 15th) (Translated by Jiren)</p>
<h3>5.6 Million Bags of Wheat to Be Shipped to Shanghai by Deadline for Distribution; Over 4 Million Bags of Flour Already Shipped North; Chinese and Japanese Manufacturers Obtain Loans Separately to Purchase Wheat</h3>
<p>The former Asia Development Board's Central China Liaison Office has approved the shipment of 5.18 million bags of flour to North China. Except for a large portion that has already been shipped, there are still 800,000 bags that the Central China Flour Manufacturers Association will continue to ship to North China via sea and land routes.</p>
<p>Slight Extension of Shipping Deadline</p>
<p>It is reported that including this batch, the Central China Flour Industry Association has already exported 4.55 million bags of flour since April this year, with the remaining 630,000 bags awaiting shipment. According to the original plan, the 5.18 million bags of flour were to be shipped by the end of this month, but due to difficulties in purchasing, it was necessary to extend the deadline slightly. Furthermore, recently, local flour exporters signed an agreement with Hainan Island flour merchants to ship flour to the island, with 5,000 bags soon to be shipped.</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Raw Wheat Shipped to Shanghai in Steady Stream</p>
<p>It is also reported that regarding the purchase of raw wheat from various regions by local flour mills, 5.6 million bags of wheat will be shipped from various production areas in Central China between October this year and April next year. Among them, 4.48 million bags will come from the area around Shanghai, and the remaining 1.2 million bags will come from the Nanjing-Wuhu area. It is said that the official price limit for raw wheat is 180 Reserve Certificates. After shipping to Shanghai, the bags are distributed to various factories to start producing flour.</p>
<p>Banks Provide Loans for Purchasing Wheat in Designated Areas: Local Chinese Merchants Fuxin and Fufeng Flour Mills purchase raw wheat from various areas with loans from the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Zhejiang Bank, Shanghai Bank, and Central South Bank, with permission from the Japanese authorities, under the joint control of the Central China Flour Industry Association, purchasing raw wheat from the Suzhou-Wuxi-Changzhou area. Japanese flour mills, on the other hand, obtain loans from Japanese banks to purchase from the Zhenjiang, Nanjing, and Wuhu areas, and are strictly controlled by a group of 27 Japanese merchants. As for transportation, it is jointly undertaken by the China Inland Shipping Company and the Central China Transportation Company.</p>
<h3>150 Billion Old Currency Already Collected and Exchanged</h3>
<p>Since June of this year, the amount of old currency collected and exchanged for Central Reserve Certificates has reached 150 billion yuan. Currently, the target for promoting Reserve Certificates has shifted from urban areas to the interior. The authorities now prohibit the circulation of old currency in areas where Reserve Certificates are recognized as the only currency, including Nanjing, Shanghai, and the rural areas near Suzhou, Jiaxing, Zhenjiang, and Hangzhou. The use of Reserve Certificates is also widespread in areas centered around Wuxi on both sides of the Yangtze River, and in areas centered around Bengbu in the Huai River basin. Recently, due to the expansion of the war situation, the circulation of Reserve Certificates has extended to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway area, with Zhuji, Yiwu, and other places seemingly forming circulation centers for Reserve Certificates, and circulation is also rapid in the counties of Ningbo, Shaoxing, and Xiaoshan.</p>
<h3>Arbitration Matters of the Insurance Industry Arbitration Committee</h3>
<p>In order to protect the legitimate rights and interests of merchants, in addition to establishing an Insurance Supervision Bureau, the Ministry of Industry submitted a proposal to the Executive Yuan and requested the Central Political Committee to approve and implement restrictions on the establishment of new insurance companies. It is stipulated that insurance companies must obtain a license before being allowed to operate, and existing companies should promptly register in accordance with the law. An Arbitration Committee has also been established, and its organization has been completed. The following is a record of the announcement: "The regulations of the Arbitration Committee of this Bureau have been submitted to the Ministry of Industry for approval and have been announced and implemented by the Bureau. Article 4 of the regulations stipulates the matters for arbitration as follows: A. Disputes between insurance companies; B. Disputes between insurance companies and brokers; C. Disputes between insurance companies and policyholders, insured persons, or beneficiaries; D. Disputes between insurance company employers and employees; E. Other arbitration matters related to the insurance industry. Now, the Arbitration Committee of this Bureau has been organized and established in accordance with the regulations. In the future, if insurance companies have disputes with various stakeholders, they can come to the Bureau to apply for arbitration."</p>
<h3>Separate Purchase Methods to Be Established for Oil and Sugar; In Addition to House Rent Receipts, Citizen Certificates Are Also Required; Severe Investigation of Price Gouging Should Be Conducted; New System for Oil Sales Can Be Agreed Upon Within One or Two Days</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Office, with the approval of the military distribution authorities, originally planned to implement the purchase of edible oil based on house rent receipts and household registration certificates yesterday, after completing all allocation procedures. However, due to the discovery of forged house rent receipts, a special announcement was made to postpone it.</p>
<p>Slight Delay in Oil Sales</p>
<p>"This office's supply of edible oil to this city was originally scheduled to begin on December 20th, based on house rent receipts and household registration certificates. However, because the authorities have discovered some forged house rent receipts and need to seriously investigate and consider them, the date has been postponed for a few days." After the authorities' orders and regulations are set, they will be announced again. "This announcement is made for your information." A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency learned from the Wholesale Office yesterday that the ringleaders involved in the forgery of house rent receipts have been investigated and dealt with by the concession authorities. Therefore, the new system for edible oil sales will continue to be implemented, and it is expected that an agreement will be reached with the authorities today (Monday) before being announced again. However, to strengthen security, it may be necessary to follow the sugar industry's method: when purchasing edible oil, one must bring their own citizen certificate/ID card, and the address must match the house rent receipt to ensure seriousness and prevent abuses.</p>
<p>Investigating Sugar Traffickers</p>
<p>After the Sugar Merchant Cooperative implemented strict sales of sugar to prevent reselling for profit, starting yesterday, those who sell sugar based on house rent receipts must also bring their own citizen certificate with an address that matches the house rent receipt. It is said that some reselling households purchase house rent receipts at high prices and resell the sugar obtained to other areas, and some vendors are even raising prices in front of retail stores, exceeding the official price by more than double. Therefore, the authorities have been requested to take effective measures to maintain people's livelihoods. It is also heard that the Cooperative discovered cases of forged donation tickets being used to purchase sugar. In addition to strictly dealing with the arrested perpetrators in accordance with the law, it has also notified various sales supervisors and inspectors to pay attention to these forged donation tickets at all times and immediately report and arrest anyone found forging them.</p>
<h3>Practicing Light Control During Alert and Warning; Vehicles and Pedestrians Should Abide by Order</h3>
<p>The city-wide air defense training exercises in the two concessions and the city area have been held seven times since the 14th. No alert was issued all day on the previous (19th), and the alert was only issued at 6:10 PM, so the streetlights were still on and vehicles were still running, which was called the alert state. The warning was lifted at 6:00 AM yesterday (20th), and the normal state was restored. Then, at the same time last night, the alert was issued again. The purpose of this exercise is to control lighting, so that residents can become familiar with the process quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>Pujiang Fire Extinguishing Drill</p>
<p>For the sake of training air defense on the river, the local air defense authorities, under the guidance of the Naval Port Affairs Department, designated the Yuanhe Wheel of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which was moored in the heart of the river, as the target, and assumed that incendiary bombs had fallen on the deck of the ship and ignited a fire, and that many people were killed or injured. This river fire extinguishing training was the first of its kind since the implementation of air defense training in the area. Participants were mainly from the Customs Port Affairs Department, and were assisted by the Maritime Police, Customs Police, Municipal Council Fire Brigade, water and soil conservation guards, groups, and other relevant agencies. The fierce fire was extinguished in just ten minutes, and the exercise ended at 4:20 PM. It was assessed that the results were quite good.</p>
<p>Laozha Rescue Performance</p>
<p>The seventh Bao of the second Lianbao in the Laozha District of the Public Concession held an air defense rescue exercise at 10:00 AM yesterday at the intersection of Hankou Road and Zhejiang Road, in front of the Lao Dongfang Hotel. Lianbao Chief Zhang Songtao and Bao Chief Chen Xiangjiu served as instructors. Qiaoben of the Japanese Navy Concession Force, Laozha Police Director Nakano, Criminal Section Chief, the chief of the Baojia system Okumura, and others came to guide the exercise. The exercise began at 10:00 AM, with performances of fire extinguishing and rescue. The techniques were extremely proficient, the performance was realistic, and the results were very satisfactory.</p>
<h3>Cracking Down on Illegal Meat Merchants</h3>
<p>The authorities of the two concessions have not relaxed their efforts to investigate the implementation of price limits for meat in various vegetable markets by sending personnel to investigate. Recently, many meat shops and stalls in small vegetable markets have been punished or suspended for violating price evaluations or having insufficient weights.</p>
<h3>Central Reserve Bank Plans to Establish Foreign Exchange Department to Handle Remittances from Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia; Officially Established in Early Spring</h3>
<p>While banks in the city are busy with year-end accounting, the Central Reserve Bank is actively planning to establish a foreign exchange department, as the bank's business is developing and it has to expand greatly. It is reported that the department is expected to be officially established in the early spring of next year, focusing on remittance business between the bank and overseas Chinese, especially in Southeast Asia. The office will be located on the fifth floor of the Central Reserve Bank at No. 15 on the Bund.</p>
<h3>International Red Cross Distributes Gifts to Prisoners of War</h3>
<p>The Shanghai office of the International Red Cross will hold its second distribution of gifts to prisoners of war held in Shanghai this month on the afternoon of the 22nd. Christmas gifts will also be distributed in small quantities at that time.</p>

<h3>Money Shops Rush to Complete Final Accounting; Cash Withdrawals from Bank Limited to Daily Deposit Amount; Central Reserve Bank and Banking Association Handle Interbank Lending</h3>
<p>The financial industry's year-end accounting period has arrived, and banks are rushing to complete interest calculation: (1) Savings departments began handling it yesterday; (2) Commercial departments are scheduled to begin on the 25th. After this interest calculation is completed, it will be credited to the accounts of various current deposit holders, and each bank will notify each depositor. However, funds deposited after the interest calculation period will be calculated again at the end of June next year. All loans will be handled in accordance with the contracts signed with the borrowers, but overdrafts must be fully repaid before the final accounting and can be resumed on the market on January 5th next year. The overdraft amount will be negotiated separately based on the credit of each current account holder. The money shops' settlement of interest on deposits and debts is usually handled on a monthly basis. The market for interest on deposits and debts for December will be settled after a resolution is reached at a public meeting. Only ordinary accounting is handled at the end of the Gregorian year. The final accounting is usually handled on Lunar New Year's Eve.</p>
<p>Tightening Credit, Rising Interest Rates on Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>Credit has tightened during the final accounting period, and the interest rate on foreign exchange in the money market has risen to 22%. According to Shanghai News Agency's inquiry with the financial industry, the reasons for the tightening of credit are: (1) Various industries need cash to be remitted to peaceful areas to purchase agricultural products such as cotton, wheat, grains, and beans; (2) Floating capital is concentrated in Shanghai, and newly established banks, money shops, trust companies, and other enterprises need it. In addition, banks have temporarily suspended all loans due to accounting reasons during this final accounting period.</p>
<p>Efforts to Adjust and Stabilize Finance</p>
<p>The Money Industry Joint Reserve has recently notified its member shops that if any shop needs to withdraw cash, it should be limited to the amount of daily deposits to limit withdrawals. As for the Banking Joint Reserve, in order to adjust interbank finance and stabilize the market, it is stipulated that if any member bank or shop needs to raise funds for legitimate purposes, it can apply for interbank lending from the association by providing property as collateral in accordance with the interbank lending methods. At the same time, the Central Reserve Bank will allow the adjustment of interbank finance during this final accounting period. All banks and shops with which it has dealings may request interbank lending from the bank.</p>
<h3>This Newspaper Hires Reporters</h3>
<p>In order to expand coverage and enrich news, this newspaper is hiring several reporters. Both full-time and part-time positions are available. If you have the ability to cover news in the fields of social affairs, economics, politics, education, and culture, and are willing to apply, please provide a detailed resume, your areas of expertise, and your desired compensation in a letter to the Editorial Department of this newspaper.

<h3>Checking of Residence Permits for Travel to Nanshi Temporarily Postponed</h3>
<p>The checking of identity and residence permits of pedestrians at the iron gates between Nanshi and the concessions has been quite strict since the 16th. Those without permits or carrying previously issued old permits are not allowed to pass. This has been reported in this newspaper. However, this inspection work only lasted for one day. It is heard that the reason is that the issuance of residence permits in Nanshi and the western districts has not yet been completed. The absence of permits for pedestrians traveling through creates difficulties for the inspection. After discussion by the authorities, the inspection work has been temporarily postponed.</p>
<h3>Adding Place Names to Stamps May Be Implemented on New Year's Day</h3>
<p>Aimed at Preventing Mutual Posting for Profit</p>
<p>Regarding the addition of place names to stamps by the Shanghai Postal Administration, a reporter from the Datong News Agency learned that this matter will take effect on New Year's Day next year. This measure is sufficient to prevent the malpractice of mutual posting of stamps for profit due to the differences in currency systems. However, the post office has not yet announced whether the stamps will be printed with provincial place names or a general name.</p>
<h3>Rectifying Weights and Measures in the City</h3>
<p>Uninspected Instruments Not Allowed to Be Sold After the Incident, weights and measures in the city became extremely chaotic, which is directly and indirectly related to the social livelihood. Therefore, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau specifically restored the weights and measures inspection office and first began to carry out inspection tasks on rice industry weights and measures in the city area. Recently, it was learned that the inspection office, in order to effectively rectify weights and measures in the city, specifically notified weights and measures manufacturers yesterday that the sale of uninspected weights and measures will be severely punished once discovered.</p>
<h3>Municipal Police Bureau Assists in Preventing Evasion of Feast Tax</h3>
<p>Since the Feast Tax Collection Office of the Municipal Finance Bureau was ordered to collect feast taxes in the city area, the collection process in the Nanshi, Pudong, Huxi, and Zhabei districts has been extremely good. The Office believes that feast tax revenue is related to the city area's education funds. In order to effectively prevent evasion and concealment, a request was submitted to the Municipal Police Bureau for assistance. After receiving the request, the Bureau immediately ordered all its subordinate branches to assist at all times to increase the city area's education funds.</p>
<h3>Salvation Army Relief Work</h3>
<p>The Salvation Army has been carrying out winter relief work in previous winter seasons, such as beggar shelters, porridge distribution centers, and providing cotton clothes to the poor. It hopes to cooperate closely with all sectors of society. Three porridge distribution centers serve more than a thousand poor people porridge every day. These are hidden poor, frugal people who are poor, sick, and unemployed. Staff members now personally investigate the poor and issue porridge tickets, which can be used to drink porridge or take it home for a meal. A thousand sets of winter clothes donated by all sectors of society have been distributed to those in need, but many poor people still lack winter clothes. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will actively donate. Candy and food will still be prepared for distribution during Christmas.</p>
<h3>Jing'an Temple Opens King of Purity Dharma Assembly</h3>
<p>Jing'an Temple has scheduled the King of Purity Dharma Assembly from the 22nd to the 24th, inviting Rongzeng Kanbu Rinpoche, the leader of the Tibetan Yellow Sect, to come to the temple to preside over the assembly, mainly practicing the Green Tara Dharma to eliminate disasters and receive blessings, so as to avert catastrophe. All are welcome to join the Dharma Assembly and participate in the potluck, with a cost of ten yuan per person.</p>
<h3>Pude Association Distributes Porridge</h3>
<p>The Pude Association at No. 8 Wenzhou Road, Aivenyi Road, will hold a winter relief porridge distribution, scheduled to begin on the 23rd of this month, distributing porridge tickets at the entrance of the Association at 2:00 PM every day, limited to 1,000 tickets per day. Each person will receive one porridge ticket, which can be used to eat a bowl of standard white porridge at various porridge shops.</p>
<h3>Memorial Service for Shi Zhibu</h3>
<p>Shi Zhibu of Liyang was a famous teacher of his time, teaching in various schools in Jiangsu for more than 40 years. In his prime, he served as an academic supervisor at Changzhou Middle School. Later, he taught at middle schools in Suzhou, Wuxi, and Jiangyin. Recently, he came to Shanghai to seek refuge. Over sixty years old, he taught at Shicheng Middle School and did not miss a single class in four years. He passed away this summer due to stomach illness. The scholarly community has lost a leader, and everyone deeply mourns him. During his lifetime, he wrote more than 30 volumes of Six Scripts Synthesis, all handwritten. All the forms of calligraphy, including inscriptions on bronze and stone tablets, and seal scripts, were complete. It was printed and published by the Commercial Press. Many other works were destroyed in the war. Only the Outline of National Examinations has recently been published. His former colleagues and friends will hold a memorial service at Qingnian Middle School, west of Hualong Road, Xiafei Road, at 10:00 AM on the 21st.

<h3>Eastern League Cup Charity Football Tournament, Second Act: Eastern League Loses to Western League by One Goal; No Goals in the First Half, One Goal Conceded in the Second Half</h3>
<p>The second act of the Eastern League Cup Charity Football Tournament, organized by the Shanghai Branch of the East Asia League China General Association, took place yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at Jiaozhou Park between the East China United Friendship Team and the Western League Team. Although there was continuous drizzle yesterday morning, fortunately, the sky cleared and the rain stopped half an hour before the match, allowing the great game to proceed smoothly, as if heaven had intentionally intervened to help. The two sides played with equal skill and strength, and the match was not affected by the weather. The result was that the Eastern League lost by a score of 1-0. The first half ended 0-0.</p>
<p>Thrilling and Exciting</p>
<p>Secretary-General Chen Fumu of the Association kicked off the match, and the Eastern League launched the first attack. Youliang sent a corner kick, which was headed by A'dai but intercepted by McNitey. Schevita of the Western League took a free kick, aiming straight for the goal, but it was saved by Xianhan. Youliang, Long Hailin, and Jinglu repeatedly launched attacks, but all came to nothing. Thereafter, the two sides exchanged attacks, but neither achieved anything, and the first half ended 0-0. During the break, a charity football was auctioned off, and Councilor Cen Zhengwu bid 22,000 taels of silver to purchase it, and then re-auctioned the ball. Mr. Pan Sanxing also bid 22,000 taels of silver to purchase it.</p>
<p>The Battle Resumes</p>
<p>The Western League replaced Fuen with Baojie as the right inside forward. Except for Su Ruo, the five forwards were all navy soldiers, and their cooperation was excellent, increasing their offensive power. On the Eastern League side, their stamina was somewhat lacking, and they were running out of energy, but fortunately, the players were determined and continued to shoot at the goal, forcing McNitey to run back and forth tirelessly. After lasting for thirty minutes, the referee failed to notice that Song Lingsheng had committed a handball in the penalty area, and penalized the Eastern League twice in a row. Sun Jinshun was then judged to have encroached under non-existent facts, and Schevita took a free kick. With a long pass, Dipanna waited by the goal, leaped up, and headed the ball, which grazed the crossbar and went into the right corner. Although Xianhan tried to save it, it was too late. After the goal, the Eastern League launched a full-scale counterattack, but time was not on their side. In the end, the Eastern League unfortunately lost to the Western League by this groundless goal.</p>

<h3>The Decisive Battle Continues (3): Broadcast Speech by Heihide, Head of the Navy Press Department; Translated from the December Issue of "Yomiuri Hochi"</h3>
<p>The Current Stage of the War</p>
<p>Judging from the development of the above naval battles and the state of combat, it is clear that these naval battles can be regarded as a "series of decisive sea battles." This illustrates the characteristics of modern naval warfare, which is unprecedented. The great significance of air power in operations has been clearly demonstrated in actual combat. Secondly, based on its strong production capacity, the enemy, regardless of the defeat in previous decisive naval battles, continues to stubbornly resist, shouting, "Final victory will surely belong to me..." We must not easily overlook these facts.</p>
<p>In the Russo-Japanese War, Russia lost its will to fight after being defeated in the Battle of the Sea of Japan, and the war ended quickly in a relatively short period. In this Greater East Asia War, the end of the war is not so easy to determine. On this point, there is a fundamental difference between the two wars, which deserves special attention.</p>
<p>Secondly, we can see that the enemy attaches particular importance to the Solomon Islands, and it is sparing no effort to ensure the safety of the Solomon Islands. Therefore, the enemy's offensive in the Solomon Islands is an unprecedented large-scale active operation. The United States is currently publicizing this as a "major decisive battle against Japan." The people also think: "After the Japanese army attacked Pearl Harbor, they regained the initiative from Japan in eight months." The American people, who are always deceived by propaganda about victory, are easily complacent and carried away. "The United States and the United Nations have begun a major advance in the Pacific, and the tide of the Pacific is about to turn back." It is as if the Japanese army has been defeated, and they are now intoxicated in the illusion of victors. American military experts also claim this to be "a major decisive battle to break the balance of power in the Pacific," placing great hope on this naval battle around the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>Hanson Baldwin, a famous military commentator, recently returned from inspecting the front lines in the Pacific. In the New York Times, he criticized the first Battle of the Solomon Islands: "After the American fleet received reports from aircraft that the Japanese fleet was approaching, it remained silent and only fired its cannons two or three times. Therefore, the responsibility for this cannot be solely attributed to Governor Ghormley. This completely exposes the 'excessive defense' mentality. If this is not corrected, the United States may be defeated." He disregarded the document from the U.S. Navy Department and spread the news of the American fleet's crushing defeat.</p>
<p>In the Solomon Islands, many of our brave warriors are also throwing themselves at the enemy as human bombs. When we think of these brave warriors who sacrificed themselves for the country, we cannot help but feel respect and offer our deepest condolences. However, as we said earlier, a single attack against the enemy in the Solomon Islands cannot determine the overall victory or defeat of the war. Because the United States is mobilizing its vast production capacity, the war is still in its early stages.</p>
<p>The Enemy's War Preparedness</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the United States has lost about nine battleships, about ten aircraft carriers, twenty-nine cruisers, fifty destroyers, and about fifty submarines in the year or so up to recently. At this time, while repairing the damaged ships, it also announced a fairly lively large shipbuilding plan. According to foreign newspaper reports, since the start of the war, four battleships, six anti-aircraft cruisers, and more than ten aircraft carriers and special aircraft carriers have been completed one after another. Furthermore, judging from the new ships that have appeared in various naval battles, the shipbuilding effort has achieved considerable results and is credible.</p>
<p>Also, because of the focus on aircraft carriers, the number of aircraft has also increased dramatically. It is said that the number of aircraft recently exceeded 4,000 in one month, and 84 merchant ships of 10,000 tons each were completed in November.</p>
<p>At the same time, several of our elite new battleships have also been commissioned long ago. Since the start of the war, our unique aircraft carriers, cruisers, and other ships, which have received combat training in the field, are also being built and commissioned one by one. In this way, our maritime power is growing, and our prestige is increasing.</p>
<p>Compared to each other, we can be confident of victory without any problems. Therefore, we must never overestimate the enemy's production capacity based solely on numbers, which would lead to a retreatist mentality. However, we must deeply consider the significance of modern warfare as a consumptive long-term war. In particular, we must clearly recognize that the production battlefield is directly related to the battlefield. The purpose of the war is to thoroughly destroy the enemy's resistance and lose their will to fight, so as to win the final victory. Therefore, winning in individual battles does not mean overall victory. Especially in this war, there is absolutely no room for compromise before the final victory is achieved.</p>
<p>Of course, even if it is a long-term war, the first year or two will truly determine the overall trend of the war; but in any case, this still depends on the determination and efforts of the military, officials, and civilians as a whole.</p>
<p>In short, we must sacrifice everything, contribute every bit of strength, and serve the Emperor with one heart as patriotic and loyal Japanese subjects. In this way, the 3,000-year history of our divine nation can be preserved. December 8th of the second year of the war can truly be said to be the "new starting point" for completely destroying the enemy. The decisive battle is underway and will continue to be waged.

<h3>Who Do You Rely On For Food?</h3>
<p>— Tao Zhi</p>
<p>Went to visit a friend.</p>
<p>The gatekeeper went in to inform him, and I waited there. I happened to see a piece of paper pasted on the wall, which I thought was for the young gatekeeper to encourage himself. The paper read: "Sweat your own sweat, eat your own food. Relying on heaven, relying on people, relying on ancestors, none of them are good heroes." What was said was indeed very good.</p>
<p>But now, it is very difficult to truly "sweat your own sweat" and be able to "eat your own food." Even if you are lucky enough not to starve to death and are able to eat a mouthful of bitter food, at most you will only be a gatekeeper for the rest of your life, and a small clerk will only be a small clerk for the rest of your life. In your own mind, you may be proud of yourself as a "hero" in an Ah Q-like way, but in the eyes of others, you will be said to be a failure because you are a gatekeeper for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>The path to "success" in this society is not to "sweat your own sweat," but to "rely on heaven, rely on people, rely on ancestors." Many people insist on pretending to be "heroes" in their own minds, but they have gone down the wrong path and ended up as semi-dead failures. "Successful" people do not need to sweat their own sweat, but they can sweat the sweat of others. The important thing is to have good ancestors to support the facade, good relatives and friends to back you up, and to be able to flatter, fawn, and charm people.</p>
<p>But if this society all becomes people who "rely on heaven, rely on people, rely on ancestors," and there are no people who "sweat their own sweat," I am worried about what kind of world this will become.</p>
<h3>The Venerable Mr. Chen</h3>
<p>— Temporary Name</p>
<p>Saving all living beings is the purpose of Buddhism, and sacrificing oneself to save others is the purpose of Jesus. Although the two religions have different doors, the spirit of saving people is the same. It is a pity that in the arena of fame and wealth, it is difficult to find this kind of spirit of willingness to sacrifice.</p>
<p>Yesterday, my friend introduced me to a friend named Chen (the founder of the Confucian Mercy Orphanage). I couldn't help but be surprised to find that there was such a person in the world who was willing to sacrifice himself.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen has a lot of research in Chinese and Western knowledge. Because of the death of his beloved daughter, he was greatly stimulated. He believes that separation of life and death is the most painful thing. Therefore, he decided to give up fame and wealth for the rest of his life to help orphans, so as to comfort others and also to comfort himself. However, after surviving the calamity, there was no way to realize his wish. He had a whimsical idea. In Zhenjiang, he carried a bucket of lime and spent the whole day writing slogans on the walls of the streets, urging people to do good. This action undoubtedly aroused the attention of the authorities. After several investigations and summonses, they all expressed sympathy. Finally, the county magistrate asked him how the expenses would be settled if he wanted to help orphans. He replied: "Do as much as you can. If you can support an orphan, support one. As long as you are willing to work hard and are willing to sacrifice, nothing is impossible." The county magistrate was very moved and immediately designated the library on the top of Yuntai Mountain, which had been destroyed, as a place to house orphans. He immediately took his wife and ran to the mountain. When he saw that the doors and windows were broken, he did not hesitate to work hard and used all his possessions to purchase the necessary materials. The couple repaired it day and night. Once, it was late at night, and he found that there were two nails missing on the window. He immediately ran from the top of the mountain to the bottom of the mountain, knocked on the hardware store that had already closed, bought the nails, and ran back to the mountain to repair the window.</p>
<p>At this time, he had already adopted two orphans. Because of the tight budget, he only ate one meal a day and saved the rations to support the orphans. He still has the same spirit today.</p>
<p>At first, the local gentry laughed at him as a madman, but his spirit finally moved the people who ridiculed him. Some people helped with rice, and some people donated money. He slowly adopted orphans, and today there are twenty-four of them. He believes that raising them without teaching them is a regret after all. So he hired two enthusiastic and knowledgeable teachers to share the responsibility of saving orphans with him. His wife took on the responsibility of washing the children's clothes and taking care of the orphans' meals and accommodation. She has done this day after day for several years without the slightest complaint. Every morning at five o'clock, she wakes up the orphans and does morning exercises together. After the exercises, they eat breakfast together. After breakfast, they sweep the place with the orphans. They have classes at eight o'clock. In the afternoon, they work in the garden with the orphans. They teach them how to do good and how to be a person at any time and any place. Therefore, very polite children are found on this mountaintop at any time.</p>
<p>His spirit and his achievements have been highly praised by the local gentry. They went to the top of the mountain to ask him about it several times. He focused all his energy on the orphans and never dressed up his appearance. The gentry only knew his name but did not know his person. No one could have imagined that the unassuming person was the great man who worked hard to save orphans. When the gentry asked him: "Is Mr. Chen at home?" He quickly replied: "He went down the mountain." Later, after many times, the gentry became suspicious. Once, they went to the mountain to visit again and sat down without leaving, insisting on seeing Mr. Chen. After sitting for almost an hour, he felt that there was no way to avoid it this time, so he had to come out and admit that he was Mr. Chen. The gentry asked him the reason for not seeing guests. He replied: "The social people express their sympathy for me, just looking at my achievements, not at me, Mr. Chen. I, Mr. Chen, am willing to work so hard, just for the sake of the orphans, not for myself. Why must I let people know me?"</p>
<p>As the number of orphans increased and prices soared, he often worried and said to himself: "It is a great sin to fail to do good." His anxious mood aroused a friend's instruction, urging him to use the garden to plant figs extensively. Then, the harvest next year will not be without some help. He immediately knelt down and thanked him, and then ran to Shanghai to buy 3,000 plants, tied them into bundles, carried them to the North Railway Station, and after various difficulties, finally transported them all to the mountain. However, enduring hunger and braving wind and rain, he fell ill as a result. Others might wait until they got better before planting. But he did not. He believes that planting one day earlier means that the orphans' livelihood will be guaranteed one day earlier. He got up while still ill and planted them one by one with his wife. Now, you can already see very lush fig trees in the garden. There is a lack of well water on the mountain, and they are reluctant to use tap water, but figs cannot be without water for a day. So he gets up every day in the middle of the night, carries two iron buckets, runs down the mountain to fetch water, and then runs back to the mountain to irrigate. He runs up and down like this until he sees the orphans doing morning exercises. It is a pity that when others are sleeping soundly under the blankets, it is the time when he is running to fetch water on the mountain under the stars and moon. He often says: "Heaven knows, it should see this heart."</p>
<p>Although he despises fame and wealth, his deeds have spread very quickly. Enthusiastic people admire his spirit and also pity his east-to-west planning. Some people are willing to donate dozens of acres of wasteland so that he can farm and feed himself, so that he can be spared the worry of "failing to do good" day and night. He was of course grateful beyond words, but was his anxiety not beyond words? He believes that the land is there, but how to raise funds for reclamation. He sighed all day long, and those who saw him were moved. The gentry sympathized with his hard work and agreed to lend him the paintings and calligraphy they had collected for him to exhibit and raise funds. He was overjoyed and ran to Shanghai, running around everywhere. He was alone for more than a month. Sure enough, his enthusiasm moved the support of celebrities in Shanghai, and the painting and calligraphy exhibition was held in the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen's deeds are close to the selflessness of Buddhism, the self-restraint of Confucianism, and the sacrifice of Jesus. This great spirit is worthy of people's admiration. If it can be promoted, it may not be the gospel of the general orphans. At the very least, his hard work of sacrificing himself to save others and saving orphans is worth offering to the society and should not be obliterated. As for his greatness, it is not convenient to announce it in order to fulfill his heart not to admire fame. Fortunately, the exhibition has not yet closed, and the orphans on the top of Yuntai Mountain are still there, and interested people have the opportunity to visit.</p>
<h3>Inscriptions and Prefaces</h3>
<p>— Objective</p>
<p>If we go to bookstores or libraries to browse books, we often see inscriptions or prefaces at the beginning of the books. Although we have not made precise statistics, we can at least say with certainty that there are particularly many inscriptions or prefaces in the publications of our recent decades, and they are all superficial, empty, and useless. In some books, the inscriptions and prefaces that people are invited to write take up as many as twenty or thirty pages. The people who write inscriptions and prefaces are either important people or celebrities, and they have nothing to do with the content of the book. The most ridiculous thing is that a literary book has many inscriptions and prefaces by illiterate soldiers, and the content is empty and pedantic, just like writing an obituary.</p>
<p>Speaking of the matter itself, it is not absolutely impossible to ask people to write inscriptions and prefaces. If you write a meaningful manuscript and send it to an authoritative scholar in this field for review and criticism, the authoritative scholar can write a few words or write a valuable preface, which can increase the reader's interest and understanding. This is originally a meaningful work.</p>
<p>However, the current situation is not like this at all. Many manuscripts are edited rather than written, so there is no need to write inscriptions and prefaces; but they make a big fuss and invite some irrelevant celebrities to write, so as to "climb the dragon" and become famous. Those celebrities who specialize in writing inscriptions and prefaces are so busy or lazy that they have not even seen the original manuscript, but they write it "out of thin air" and "seriously," doing their best to flatter and praise. In fact, it's just mutual promotion! Sometimes, the author prepares the words or articles in advance and asks the celebrity to copy them or sign a name on them for publication. They "look at each other and smile, and understand each other's hearts."</p>
<p>In ancient times, authors often said some polite words such as "disaster pear and disaster jujube" in their prefaces. If it is really a "disaster pear and disaster jujube," then the first thing that should be is the boring inscriptions and prefaces.</p>
<p>"Insufficient gains" The same is true for inscriptions and prefaces. Many books, especially translations, absolutely need a preface that introduces and criticizes the original work for the sake of readers. But most translators are too lazy to add it. Maybe this is hiding clumsiness? But the readers suffer.</p>
<p>Sincerely, I hope that writers and publishers in general will consider the interests of readers and the cost of publications; and always remember this principle: increase the benefits for readers without increasing the burden on readers' purchases.</p>
<h3>Talking About Rats</h3>
<p>— Ji Si</p>
<p>The "old" in rats does not contain the meaning of age; because newborn rats are called small rats, which, like the "old" in small tigers, does not mean anything.</p>
<p>Northerners call rats "haozi," which does express the characteristics of rats; because rats are consuming to us humans. If there are rats in the house, food, clothing, and even utensils will all be consumed.</p>
<p>According to Darwin's theory of evolution, rats appeared in the world earlier than humans. From ancient times to the present, rats have been said to have hundreds of disadvantages and not a single advantage to humans. The Book of Songs records things about rats, such as "Who says a rat has no teeth? How can it pierce the walls!"</p>
<p>"Big rat, big rat, do not eat my millet!... Big rat, big rat, do not eat my wheat!... Big rat, big rat, do not eat my seedlings!..." There is no good feeling for rats. As for all the nouns, all those involving rats are also used to express the meaning of insult and contempt, such as "rat," "rat skills," "rat generation," "rat scurrying," "rat looking," "rat theft," "deer head and rat eyes," etc.</p>
<p>Generally superstitious people attach great importance to the actions of rats. If they hear the sound of "rats counting money" in the evening, it is said to indicate that there is wealth coming; if it is in the morning, it is said to indicate that wealth is going out. In fact, it's just that when rats encounter danger, all the hair on their bodies stands up, and their mouths make a sound that seems like people counting copper coins.</p>
<p>In old houses, snakes often eat rats in summer. The snake surrounds the rat circle by circle with its slender, rope-like body. The rat makes a pitiful squeaking sound. People should feel happy when rats are swallowed by snakes. But because people are very afraid of snakes, they feel fear instead of seeing snakes eating rats, and treat it as an ominous thing.</p>
<p>With the development of science, pathologists have confirmed that rats can transmit a disease called "plague" or "black death"; the rats are even more guilty of being the public enemy of mankind. Therefore, eliminating rats is regarded as a necessary measure. Iron wire cages, iron clips, and even phosphorus paste for poisoning rats are constantly being made!</p>
<p>In ancient times, people used weasels to catch rats. Weasels are also called yellow weasels, and they are very good at catching rats; but they also love to steal chickens. The weasel catches rats on one hand and steals chickens on the other. In people's eyes, the merits are not enough to cover the sins. After careful consideration, people no longer raise weasels to catch rats, but instead raise cats.</p>
<p>During the war, people especially cherish food; therefore, they are even more hostile to rats. We hope that after Shanghai prohibits spitting, there will be a "rat extermination campaign."</p>
<h3>Sharing the Boat Through Storms</h3>
<p>— Xiang Jia Zhi</p>
<p>12. Backyard Flowers</p>
<p>Auntie Chen, who worked for the Wei Cheng and others, had left, hesitating for a moment. Thinking that if Guo Fang received my letter and hurried back, it definitely wouldn't be this quick. So Guo Fang was originally planning to return. Why didn't she wait until tomorrow or the day after? If she came back tomorrow or the day after, Huang Long would be here. I'm assuming I should answer the call now. According to Auntie Chen, isn't there still a Miss Zhu at her house? Wei Cheng paced back and forth in the room, sometimes with his hands behind his back, sometimes with both hands on the table. The first thing he had to decide was his attitude towards Guo Fang. He thought for a long time and almost didn't want to stay at the Wang Shun Xing Inn anymore. He just wanted to shrink his neck and go straight home, pretending not to know that Guo Fang had ever returned to Shuangqiao. Then, he slammed the table and suddenly remembered what he had said to Huang Long. Huang Long laughed at me for only being able to raise this hand to kill the enemy's son, but not being able to raise that hand to kill the enemy's daughter. What did I say at the time? As soon as Wei Cheng thought of this, he immediately mustered up some courage, pulled out the knife that Huang Long had hidden under the mattress, held it in his hand and tested it, then backed away a few steps, aimed at the edge of the bed, and threw it from a distance. If this throw had come from Huang Long, there's no need to say, it would definitely have gone in three inches, with the knife handle swaying on the edge of the bed like a willow in the wind. But now, Wei Cheng's throw was too far from his intended expectation. The knife and the edge of the bed didn't make any contact, and it just fell to the ground with a clatter. Wang the madman asked from outside the door, "Mr. Ye, what fell?"</p>
<p>Wei Cheng was thinking, if he didn't go to the Chen's house soon, Auntie Chen would come again. He held the knife, paid Wang the madman fifty dollars for room and board, and walked out of the inn in the dim twilight. He pursed his lips, put on what he thought was a smile, and stepped onto the street. At first, he walked at a normal pace, but then he gradually slowed down. He saw that the shops in Shuangqiao Town still had a New Year atmosphere, and the black characters written on the red paper could be faintly seen. Looking again, two large elm trees appeared in front of him, this was Chen Guo Fang's house. His heart almost jumped out of his mouth. Suddenly, he turned around and ran wildly. (248)</p>
<h3>A Reporter's Visit to the Divine Soldiers in the Gaoligong Mountains (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Jie Feng</p>
<p>(Originally published in the December 6th issue of the Yomiuri Hochi Shimbun)</p>
<p>Yomiuri Hochi Shimbun reporter dispatched by the Army Press Department of the General Headquarters, Yasushi Sano (From somewhere on the China-Burma border)</p>
<p>In the Trenches on the Yunnan Front</p>
<p>On this friendly army position, there is a pine forest at an elevation of 5,200 feet, where white and yellow alpine plants sway pitifully in the morning breeze. Behind the trenches, many simple huts have been built. These are soldiers' small huts that serve as kitchens and dining halls, and also as rest rooms. Adjacent to the small huts, there are no chicken coops or pig pens. On the chicken coop's wire mesh and on the sloping roof of the small hut, there are also many red persimmons drying in the sun.</p>
<p>"To fight such a war and still make the people at home uneasy is too much to say. We are now on the front line, practicing this kind of local self-sufficiency. Raising chickens and pigs is also for this purpose. On the first day of the New Year, we plan to have a big feast!"</p>
<p>The soldier "on cooking duty" said with a smile.</p>
<p>In addition, many exercise equipment and movable logs have been built on the position. It is said that this is the only effective way to get rid of epidemics.</p>
<p>During the rainy season from June to early October, the soldiers rarely eat vegetables. Sometimes, they have to fill their stomachs with goosefoot and pumpkin vines. But they don't utter a word of complaint and are still fighting stubbornly. When asked, then—</p>
<p>"Is everyone at home doing well? What exactly happened with the American air raid on April 18th?" These two questions are repeatedly asked. To these two points, I answered them like this:</p>
<p>"Even with such a big war going on, the country is still dealing with it calmly. The lives of the Japanese people are very rich. The American air raid on April 18th was nothing. The captured pilots were severely punished. The enemy's guerrilla-like psychological warfare, on the contrary, only created the opposite effect. Now, everyone is excited and unanimously saying: What's so scary about an air raid!"</p>
<p>After that, I told them two stories: one was about a servant who bravely fought the enemy with an incendiary bomb; the other was about an old woman who used a rice bucket to put out an incendiary bomb. The soldiers, upon hearing this, all shouted "Unbelievable, unbelievable" and cheered. The unit commander added:</p>
<p>"Here, I call it Takamagahara. Overlooking from a high vantage point, with the clouds and rainbows in sight, this place can simply be called a paradise. In terms of daily life, although we feel various inconveniences, the enemy is right in front of us, and we always hold the hope of going to war and a burning fighting spirit. Before these hopes and fighting spirits, the minor inconveniences of life are simply not worth mentioning. It is said that there are hermits living among the clouds and mists, and we who stand on the front line, encouraged by the burning 'fighting soul', are close to that state. Therefore, there is nothing to worry about on the front line. The wish of our front-line soldiers is to always hope that the people in the rear are invigorated and that they live a warm and prosperous life…"</p>
<p>Here, in the Takamagahara of Yunnan, what I saw was the admirable heroic posture of these divine soldiers who were determined to support the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>From Yangon to the Forefront</p>
<p>The so-called Burma Road refers to the 1,100-kilometer road from Kunming in Yunnan Province to Lashio in Burma. From Lashio to Yangon, the same 1,100 kilometers, runs parallel to the railway line, and there is also a flat paved road, on which trucks loaded with aid supplies for Chiang pass. I first flew by plane from Yangon to Meimyo, then took a train from Meimyo to Mandalay, from Mandalay to Lashio, and then from Lashio, I took a covered night truck to the forefront, passing through Wanting, Mangshi, Longling, and other places, directly reaching the first line of the Nu River, and traversed more than 1,500 kilometers of winding Burma Road. One clear morning, the plane left Mingaladon Airport, and below I saw the rich fields representing the "Rice Country" of Burma. The Irrawaddy River was on the left. A little further north, I reached Bago, with its red earth and green fields. The dense forests of neem trees, the Irrawaddy River spreading out in all directions like spider legs, and the turbid brown current flowing torrentially there. The plane turned right over Yangon and arrived at Meimyo. This is a plateau at an altitude of 2,700 feet. During the hot season, the Myanmar central government always moves its offices here from Rangoon.</p>
<p>After arriving in Meimyo, I changed to a car and traveled 68 kilometers in the opposite direction on the Burma Road to reach Yangon. Yangon is a very bleak place, with scorched earth everywhere. All the street trees, such as Bauhinia, have been burned. This was set on fire by Chinese arsonists before our army occupied it. Only the area near the former royal city still has some remaining greenery. The water in the moat and the spires of the pagodas on Yangon Hill decorate this desolate ruin. It is said that after the scorched earth, epidemics are prevalent in this area!</p>
