<h3 id="c1">談歐菲戰局 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>第二次世界大戰發展到今日，主要可分爲四大戰塲：一個是以太平洋爲中心的大東亞戰爭，一個是東部歐洲的德蘇戰爭，一個是西部歐洲的　英戰爭，另一個是從地中海至菲洲的北菲戰爭；此外就是比較居於次要地位的埃及戰爭。這些戰爭中心，比較主要的，就只有東方以日本爲主的大東亞戰爭，和西方以德蘇爲主的東歐戰爭。不過，自從日本發動了大東亞戰爭以後，給德義兩國在歐菲作戰以很大的帮助，而且使歐菲戰爭和亞洲戰爭，一天天趨向於會師的途徑。因此，我們在目前來觀測和研究歐菲戰爭，是非常必要的。</p>
<p>歐菲戰爭，從去年六月二十二日德蘇戰爭爆發以後，戰事的重心，就移在東歐和蘇聯的境內，雙方演出了歷史上空前的激戰。不過多少還受着季節的影響，觀察德方的攻略，大體上是以冬季爲準備時期，以春季爲進攻時期，到夏季即使戰爭發展到頂點，秋季便成爲鞏固和擴大戰爭的時期。回顧去年德軍自對蘇開戰以後，長驅直入，迫至首都莫斯科城下，列寗格勒也幾乎完全進入德軍掌握；可是，由於季節的關係，蘇聯得别各路軍之助，使德蘇戰爭頓呈膠着狀態，而德軍乃從事於新攻勢的準俯時期。到今年春季之交，德軍又開始發動進攻，攻陷了烏克蘭的首郡哈科夫，和南俄重鎭西紅斯托波爾，至秋季而進迫史太林格勒城。但也由於季節的關係，使德蘇戰爭又入膠着狀態。而史太林則更鄭重地指斥過去一年間英美未開闢第二戰綫以致釀成聯合國處於被動和失敗地位的過錯，唤起關於第二戰綫的展開，以圖改變整個戰爭局面。</p>
<p>英美對於史太林的第二戰綫的要求，始終是實行着敷衍的態度，口頭上文字上似乎非常熱闹，實際上即始終沒有誠意。因此，自從去年夏季以來，西歐的德英戰爭固然始終消沉，就是北非埃及戰事，英美也只取消極的戰路，而且常處於失敗的地位。可是，自從大東亞戰爭爆發以後，英美在太平洋上的勢力頻於總崩潰的境地，不僅西南太平洋已入於日軍掌握，而且印度的火藥庫邊已開始爆炸，日本的軍事力量頻向印度洋進逼，所謂英帝國之皇冠的印度已處於日本飛機和砲艦的威脅之下，而德義軍隊也有經紅海而與日軍會帥的趨勢。這樣，英國如果再不另作計較，則就有立刻崩潰的危險。這是英美不得不準備在歐菲發動反攻的第一個原因。其次，地中海是英國的生命綫，也是今日英美保持對蘇聯連絡和在土耳其爭取優勢的根據地。可是，由於德義勢力發展的結果，地中海的英國地位已一天一天的走上了末落的過程，英國在那裏的軍略根據地如直布羅陀，馬爾太等，已因義大利空軍的發達而減　了原有的價值，以致在最近一年來直布羅陀與蘇彝士運河的連絡，爲軸心海空軍所阻斷，即英美援蘇和與印度的連絡，已不得不遠繞南非的好望角經過印度洋的遠路。反之，義大利在連絡西西里　泰雷利亞與利此里的特黎波里之綫，及連絡維德斯萊洛斯與利此亞的杜布羅克之綫上，放置了地中海戰略系體的重點，把地中海分成了東西兩　，切斷了英國的生命綫。尤其是西地中海方向，英國的弱點日益顯著，過去已不能不依賴於法國軍事力量，自從它的同盟國法蘭西洛伍以後，西地中海便不能不受到軸心國的威脅，今年六月至八月間西地中海上英國海戰的挫敗，就是最明顯的例子。以上種種現實形勢，已把英國逼到非滅亡即反攻的路上，而蘇聯和美國顯然是更願意幫助英國的反攻的。這是最近北非戰爭的根本原因。</p>
<p>英美侵入北菲，主要的目的，是企圖由戰略的守勢轉變到攻勢，從軸心方面奪取主動。在牠們的周密的準備和相當大規模的作戰計劃上觀測，牠們這次敢於侵略，自然不容輕視，不容作過低的估價。英美侵略北菲的意圖，顯然是想在那裏打定一個立脚點，以便向歐洲大陸展開攻勢，所以在北菲展開的戰鬥，不能不認爲是具有向地中海一帶擴大的必然性的。這是從整個戰略上的觀察。其次，英美軍的侵略北菲，是企圖奪取法蘭西在地中海上成爲戰略體系中樞之一的阿爾及里亞的奥朗與突尼斯的比塞大，以强化他們在地中海的軍略地位。比塞大是對抗義大利班泰雷利亞的强有力的根據地，突尼斯是從菲洲到義大利本土距離最短的戰略要點，從這裏到班泰雷利亞，祇有六十公里，而從班泰雷利亞到西西里也不過九十六公里。所以英美軍集中攻勢於突尼斯，而　義軍也不惜接連放棄杜布羅克·德爾那·班加齊等地中海要點，集中力量以展開突尼斯的反攻。這是對於目防北菲與地中海戰爭重心的觀察。再次，我們要知道地中海在政治上和經濟上對於歐洲一大半的國家，具有密切的利害關係，特別是法蘭西·西班牙·葡萄牙和東面的土耳其，東北的巴爾幹諸國，他們的立塲，常依着地中海情形而發生深刻的甚至是決定性的影響，英美這次在北菲的攻勢，顯然對這些國家是具有着政治上經濟上某種限度的誘惑力量的。觀乎都倫港內法國海軍參加大叛變的陰謀，便可以推測其更遠大的陰謀了。至於爲了對付蘇聯第二戰綫的要求，自然也是誇大宣傳北菲攻勢的原因之一，這在史太林答美國記者的談話中和邱吉爾在議會的報告中，多少也有若干透露出來。</p>
<p>當然，在今日推測歐菲戰爭的發展前途還是太早，英美軍雖然侵入北菲，而北菲西菲的法國軍官們也在達助和戴高樂分別領導下成立了叛變的政權；但是，若不能發展到確立他在地中海上的支配，主要是如果不能確保在突尼斯的優勢，則還不加成爲可以支配歐洲戰局的决定的勢力；而且，事情的發展，也和英美的企圖隔着更遙遠的距離：第一，具有決定性的戰爭，在突尼斯和比塞大間進行，德義已經取回了主動到自己這一方面；第二，法國的叛變在德義閃電鎭壓之下平靖了，法國更向「一體化」的途徑和德義合作了；第三，尤其值得注意的是德軍之斷然進駐都倫港，解除了準備叛變的法國陸海軍的武裝，雖然演出了叛亂法水手全部　沉軍艦的悲痛的事件，然而穗義佔領都倫以後，不但保障了法國南部下再有被英美軍侵入的危險，而且也更强化了義大利本國的國防力量，强化了軸心在地中海上的優越形勢，打破了上述英美方面的戰略上和政略上經濟上的企圖。特别值得注意的，就是英美在這孤注一擲的攻勢中，既沒有吸出德方在東綫的任何主要的兵力，也沒有挽救在東方繼續慘敗的羞辱，最近蘇羅門戰役的慘敗，就說明了英美在歐菲攻略的最重要的失敗的因素，已經在太平洋上發現了。</p>

<h3 id="c21">物價高壓下　內地小學教師之生活　教師服務情緒遭受影響　各校延聘教師極感困難 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>近年內地物價上漲過速，從事教學事業者之生活，愈趨清苦。即以小學而言，教師待遇，雖云提高，然以有限之數額，與無限之物價相較，則落後殆屬必然。其受艱苦壓迫，實不難想像。</p>
<p>廣東民間有一句俗語，形容小學教師之清苦：「晤窮晤教學，哦餓晤吃壳。」實思是：非窮至萬不得已時，決不教學；非餓至萬不得已時，決不吃壳。以吃壳比教學，何等令人感慨之事！</p>
<p>小學教師生活之清苦，不獨影響現任教師之服務情緒，甚目影響新教師之延聘。現在內地小學校長最感痛苦者，莫若聘不到教師。有若干小學，學期將近結束，而教師缺額，仍無法補充，此種情形，相當普遍，其性質之嚴重，實不容忽視。</p>
<p>廣西省素爲注重基層教育之省份，對於基層教育人員之待遇，亦不時予以改善，並採用徵發實物制度。例如若干縣份之小學教師，每月除由縣政府領取生活費三十餘元外，並得向鎭公所領取由各民戶徵抽而來之稻穀八十市斤。（五六十斤者亦有）如此待遇，維持最低限度個人生活，尚有困難，但村街長往往延不繳納稻穀，致各教師飯食，無法解決，祇有向廚房賒欠，久後，廚房同樣無法支持，其結果必然影響全校教務之進行。甚至有表面開門，實際停頓者。至於不發實物，改發代金之縣市，情形亦多類是。此種現象，不獨廣西一省如此，其他省份，亦復如此，茲舉出實例數則，以覘一斑：</p>
<p>（一）臨桂縣蘇橋鄉中心學校，一教師報告：「……此間生活問題，難於解決，我的薪水，每月由縣政府發給生活費三十六元，另由各村抽來食米五十斤，但自今年二月以後，即不能收到一粒米，同事們大都是本地人，還能够向家庭想法，而我是外鄉人，並且囊空如洗，如何過得去呢？」</p>
<p>（二）永福縣中心學校一教師報告：一……我們每月的生活費，一方面靠政府發給幾十元薪金，一方面靠學生捐繳一些食米或貸金，但許多窮學生，都無力辦到、在目前是不够維持必要之營養的，我們已經不敢希望吃蔬菜，更不敢希望吃肉類，而祇希望吃白飯，但因爲飯煮的不多，在每天上午和下午最後一課搖下課鈴後，教室裏教師們，不管書講完沒有，都飛跑到膳　裏來搶飯吃，影響學生的學業和心理，是非常　大的。」</p>
<p>（三）柳江縣一督學的報告「……城中鎭中心校校長，因鎭長不能照發食米，於是率領全校教師向鎭長興問罪之師，結果被縣政府撤職。」</p>
<p>廣東小學教師收入，高者每月約八九十无，低者僅三四十元，內中還有「直屬」與「非直屬」之分別，「直屬」學校之教學，當然比較易於　到優待。此外，廣東亦有「學米」制度，向學生每人每月徵收一市斤，但因徵收方法，各地頗不一致，困難甚多，不易匀允，致教師生活，仍難安定。</p>
<p>其次，因小學經費之不裕，致設備亦無法求全，若干偏僻縣分，除破屋　橡外，簡直毫無設備之可言　甚至報紙亦付闕如，教師身處閉塞之鄉間，與外界一無接　，國內大勢與國際動態，均茫無所知，其精神上之痛苦，實不下於物質上之困難。</p>
<p>重慶政權教育部，年來屢次發表注重教育，提倡國民教育，改善教師待遇之文告，洋洋灑灑，頭頭是道，所耗教育經費，更是可觀。而於負有基層教育使命之小學教師待過，仍是口惠而　不至，提倡云何？改善云何？</p>

<h3 id="c46">「江舟泣血記」觀感 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>— 梅伯</p>
<p>「江舟泣血記」原名爲「怒吼吧中國」，據說以前在上海曾兩度演出過，可惜沒有躬逢其盛，不能將兩者印象地加以比較。這次强調反英美一點，內容上似乎刪改了許多。若干塲面因此就不免單調。例如第一幕第二景，寫美國人阿斯來與船夫爭吵以至溺水殞命，全最對話不過五六句，演出至多不過五分鐘，按說只要艦長（嚴俊飾）一句話表過就算了，現在把牠獨立成爲一景，似乎太不經濟。也許原作就是這樣；那便是原作者的疏忽了。</p>
<p>綜觀全劇，我以爲第一幕與第二幕姣强於其他二幕　也許這是我的偏愛；我總覺得一部藝術作品，與比揷人許多演講詞，寗肯訴之觀衆的直覺，扣動他們的心弦，使他們整個兒被作品陶醉，例如第一幕中，有許多諷刺的對話，非常巧妙，觀衆聽了，時時會浮上會心的微笑。第三幕中幾個船夫的對話，親切而有人情味，也値得我們細細　回味。</p>
<p>導演方面，李萍倚先生相當費了些苦心，但是電影明星演話劇，我　覺得有點一差勁兒」。一個顯明的事實，就是這次參加演出的明星中，以話劇爲「娘家」　，一般地都比眞正老牌的明星成績好。這不正說明了話劇的特殊性麽？</p>
<p>至於演員個別的演技，我對嚴俊的艦長是特別愛好的。嚴俊的臺詞，極盡抑揚頓挫之致，足够把個艦長不可一世的聲勢氣派表現了出來二璐珊臺詞也很流暢，可惜戲不多。張琬飾胎夫乙的妻，始終把握住一貫的情緒，是難能可貴的。徐立的老船夫，不瘟不火，適可而止，似乎比演老　的那位（我看的不是姜明）强得多。演員表中最莫明其妙的就是老費這個角色。這樣一個知書達禮的船夫，在中國的現實里似乎找不出幾個。餘如道尹（那天似乎是周文彬？），黃翻譯，人物都不如前面幾個特出，此地就略而不論了。未人</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>— 未人</p>
<p>「江舟泣血記」是蕭平根據蘇聯未來派詩人屈萊泰角夫原著「怒吼吧！中國」所改編，導演李萍倩，全劇共四幕，第一幕軍艦，第二幕道尹公署，第三幕船夫公會，第四幕墓地和刑塲，參加演出的，除路　外，大部都是「中聯」的演員。</p>
<p>故事發生於一九二四年六月的萬縣，爲了一個船夫計長興，由爭吵而不幸打翻舢板，把可憐的那不懂泅水的美國紳士阿勘來淹死了，於是　　人提出「哀的美敦書，要求中國官廳接受四項苛刻條件，共　的一項是：必須處決二個沒有經過法律裁判的無辜船夫。</p>
<p>憶二十二年九月的秋天，我在黃金大戲院看上　戲劇協社演出的「怒吼吧！中國」，是應雲衛導演的，演員陣容旣緊强，劇本的質量父健全，因此很使我滿意，那時我還只十六歲，我的然情橫溢，爲了這戲的最後一幕二個船夫的絞決，我幾乎眞的在戲院裏哭了！</p>
<p>這一回，我再看「江舟泣血記」，已經整整地過了十年，十年來，我在被壓迫的生活的鬥爭裏摸索，我在痛苦的環境裏掙扎，我牽記「怒吼吧！中國」。</p>
<p>從第一幕到第四幕，我是始終給嚴肅的情緒包圍着，這裏，有血，有淚，更有年靑人的一顆跳躍的心。</p>
<p>導演手法，頗見輕鬆，演員方面，以姜明的老費，和嚴俊的艦長，最見成功。姜明在第二幕中同道尹的那段對白，眞所謂「聲淚俱下」，而嚴浚的一貫洋派的傲氣，把洋人的輪廓，個性，動作等等，都描摩得維妙維肖。其他如呂玉　的船夫，徐立的老船夫，顧也魯的黃翻譯，張琬的船夫妻，周女彬的道尹，路珊的艦長妻，也能合乎身份，並且穩練得很。洪警鈴，秦桐，周起，徐莘園，倉隱秋，關宏達，韓蘭根，章志直，陳琦等，戲不多，沒有甚麽妙揮。</p>
<p>布景和道具是考究的，第一幕第二景的浪潮，第三幕的浮雲，燈光打得聰明之至，效果也很好，如風聲，拋錨聲，狗吠聲，都能像眞。</p>
<p>「江舟泣血記」，是今年話劇界的特殊收穫。</p>

<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（二）　仇家</p>
<p>黃龍向他道了謝，父問王順　在那裏，那夥計一指道：「前面便是，門口有一盞玻璃燈，玻璃上寫着紅字，一個王字，大一些，順興兩字小一些，你們識字不識？」維城在後邊說道：「識字。好了，我們自己我去，謝謝你。」維城說了，他就走在黃龍前面。街上兩旁的商店，一家一家在收市，把門戶裏僅有的燈光，給排門遮蔽了，兩人一脚高一脚低的闖過去，到了十字路口。黃龍抬起手來，拍，打在腦袋上，維城回過臉來問道：「做什麽？」黃龍道：「什麼王順興李順興，原來是王瘋子茶館，我倒記起來了。往北拐彎，我認得。」黃龍搶任維城的前面，拐了彎，笑道：「前面便是，再也不用看燈上的什麽字了，我在這裏打過人。走過去沒幾步，維　還是仰起頭看了一看，果然有燈，燈沒亮，可不知道上邊寫些什麼字。從半張桌子在簷下，半張桌子在戶內的一個戶檻裏走進去，恍然於這王順興客棧的門面，是茶館：王瘋子茶館的內部，是王順興客棧。</p>
<p>黃龍在前，走在黯淡無光的壁燈下，引維城進了一道玻璃門。玻璃很光亮，光亮得一道道的裂痕上，看得出滿貼着十三四個膏藥。黃龍對門裏的人點點頭，帳桌上坐着個老頭兒來招待。黃　道：「我們要一間房，幾張牀倒是隨使。」那老頭兒說：「有有有。」引　屛後一間房裏，黃龍道：「燈呢？那老　兒道：「來了來了，客人別忙。你們從那裏來？」黃龍道：「白天在賭錢，從賭錢的地方來。」燈來了，照見房裏剛是兩張牀，黃龍去推開了兩扇矮窗看看，是一條狹弄，燈光反映到窗外的牆上。維城連說：「很好很好，你是掌櫃的吧？我們去吃了晚飯再來。那老頭兒笑道：「是的，我是王瘋子，其實一些也不瘋，人家這樣喚，我就這樣應。客人到外邊是吃晚飯，那怕沒有地方吃。」　（二三九）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Discussion on the European and African War Situation <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The Second World War, as it has developed to this day, can be mainly divided into four major battlefields: one is the Greater East Asia War centered on the Pacific Ocean, one is the German-Soviet War in Eastern Europe, one is the British-German War in Western Europe, and the other is the North African War from the Mediterranean Sea to Africa; in addition, there is the Egyptian War, which is relatively secondary. Among these war centers, the more important ones are only the Greater East Asia War in the East, dominated by Japan, and the Eastern European War in the West, dominated by Germany and the Soviet Union. However, since Japan launched the Greater East Asia War, it has greatly helped Germany and Italy in their operations in Europe and Africa, and has made the European and African Wars and the Asian War move closer to convergence day by day. Therefore, it is very necessary for us to observe and study the European and African War at present.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the German-Soviet War on June 22 last year, the focus of the European and African War has shifted to Eastern Europe and the territory of the Soviet Union, where the two sides have staged an unprecedented fierce battle in history. However, it is still affected by the seasons to some extent. Observing the German strategy, it is generally based on winter as the preparation period, spring as the offensive period, and even if the war develops to its peak in summer, autumn becomes the period for consolidating and expanding the war. Looking back, after the German army launched a war against the Soviet Union last year, it drove straight in and approached the capital Moscow, and Leningrad was almost completely under the control of the German army; however, due to seasonal factors, the Soviet Union was assisted by various armies, which made the German-Soviet War suddenly become deadlocked, and the German army was engaged in the preparation period for a new offensive. At the turn of this spring, the German army began to launch an offensive again, capturing Kharkov, the capital of Ukraine, and Sevastopol, an important town in southern Russia, and approaching Stalingrad in autumn. However, also due to seasonal factors, the German-Soviet War entered a deadlock again. Stalin more solemnly denounced the mistakes of the United Kingdom and the United States in failing to open up a second front in the past year, which led to the passive and failed position of the United Nations, and called for the development of the second front in an attempt to change the entire war situation.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom and the United States have always adopted a perfunctory attitude towards Stalin's demand for a second front. The verbal and written statements seem very lively, but in fact there has never been any sincerity. Therefore, since last summer, the British-German War in Western Europe has always been sluggish, and even in the North African Egyptian War, the United Kingdom and the United States have only adopted a passive strategy and have often been in a position of failure. However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the power of the United Kingdom and the United States in the Pacific has frequently collapsed. Not only has the Southwest Pacific fallen into the hands of the Japanese army, but also the gunpowder depot of India has begun to explode. The Japanese military power has frequently advanced towards the Indian Ocean, and India, the so-called crown of the British Empire, is under the threat of Japanese planes and gunboats, and the German and Italian troops also have a tendency to meet with the Japanese army through the Red Sea. In this way, if the United Kingdom does not make other plans, it will be in danger of collapsing immediately. This is the first reason why the United Kingdom and the United States have to prepare to launch a counter-offensive in Europe and Africa. Secondly, the Mediterranean Sea is the lifeline of the United Kingdom, and it is also the base for the United Kingdom and the United States to maintain contact with the Soviet Union and strive for advantages in Turkey today. However, due to the development of German and Italian forces, the British position in the Mediterranean has been declining day by day. The British military bases there, such as Gibraltar and Malta, have been reduced in value due to the development of the Italian air force, so that in the recent year, the connection between Gibraltar and the Suez Canal has been blocked by the Axis air and sea forces, and the connection between the United Kingdom and the United States to aid the Soviet Union and India has had to bypass the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa and pass through the distant route of the Indian Ocean. On the contrary, Italy has placed the focus of the Mediterranean strategic system on the line connecting Sicily and Terrelia with Tripoli in Libya, and the line connecting Vedesleslos with Dobruk in Libya, dividing the Mediterranean into east and west, and cutting off the lifeline of the United Kingdom. Especially in the western Mediterranean, the weakness of the United Kingdom is becoming increasingly obvious. In the past, it had to rely on French military power. Since its ally France, Luo Wu, the western Mediterranean has to be threatened by the Axis powers. The failure of the British naval battle in the western Mediterranean from June to August this year is the most obvious example. All the above-mentioned realistic situations have forced the United Kingdom to either perish or counter-attack, and the Soviet Union and the United States are obviously more willing to help the British counter-attack. This is the root cause of the recent North African War.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the British and American invasion of North Africa is to try to change from a strategic defensive to an offensive, and seize the initiative from the Axis powers. Judging from their careful preparations and considerable large-scale combat plans, their daring to invade this time should not be underestimated or underestimated. The intention of the British and American invasion of North Africa is obviously to establish a foothold there in order to launch an offensive against the European continent. Therefore, the battle in North Africa must be regarded as having the inevitability of expanding to the Mediterranean region. This is an observation from the entire strategy. Secondly, the British and American troops invaded North Africa in an attempt to seize Algiers, Oran, and Bizerte in Tunisia, which have become one of the strategic system hubs in the Mediterranean, in order to strengthen their military strategic position in the Mediterranean. Bizerte is a powerful base against Pantelleria in Italy, and Tunis is the strategic point with the shortest distance from Africa to the Italian mainland. From here to Pantelleria, it is only 60 kilometers, and from Pantelleria to Sicily, it is only 96 kilometers. Therefore, the British and American forces concentrated their offensive on Tunisia, and the German and Italian forces did not hesitate to give up the Mediterranean strongholds such as Dobruk, Derna, and Benghazi, and concentrated their forces to launch a counter-offensive in Tunisia. This is an observation on the focus of the defense of North Africa and the Mediterranean War. Again, we must know that the Mediterranean Sea has close interests with more than half of the countries in Europe in terms of politics and economy, especially France, Spain, Portugal, and Turkey in the east, and the Balkan countries in the northeast. Their positions often have a profound or even decisive impact depending on the situation in the Mediterranean. The British and American offensive in North Africa obviously has a certain degree of political and economic temptation for these countries. Judging from the conspiracy of the French navy in Toulon to participate in a major rebellion, one can infer its more far-reaching conspiracy. As for dealing with the Soviet Union's demand for a second front, it is naturally one of the reasons for exaggerating the North African offensive. This is also revealed to some extent in Stalin's conversation with American reporters and Churchill's report in Parliament.</p>
<p>Of course, it is still too early to predict the development prospects of the European and African War today. Although the British and American forces have invaded North Africa, and the French military officers in North Africa and West Africa have also established rebellious regimes under the leadership of Dazhu and De Gaulle; however, if they cannot develop to establish their dominance in the Mediterranean, especially if they cannot ensure their advantage in Tunisia, they will not become a decisive force that can dominate the European war situation; moreover, the development of the situation is even more distant from the British and American attempts: first, the decisive war is being carried out between Tunis and Bizerte, and Germany and Italy have taken back the initiative to their side; second, the French rebellion has been quelled under the lightning suppression of Germany and Italy, and France has further cooperated with Germany and Italy on the path of "integration"; third, what is particularly noteworthy is that the German army resolutely stationed in the port of Toulon and disarmed the French army and navy that were preparing to rebel. Although the tragic incident of all the rebellious French sailors sinking the warship was staged, after the Suiyi occupied Toulon, not only was the danger of the French south being invaded by the British and American forces again, but also the national defense strength of Italy itself was further strengthened, and the superior situation of the Axis powers in the Mediterranean was strengthened, breaking the above-mentioned strategic, political and economic attempts of the British and American sides. What is particularly noteworthy is that in this desperate offensive, not only did the United Kingdom and the United States not draw out any major forces from the German side on the eastern front, but they also failed to save the humiliation of continuing to be defeated miserably in the East. The recent disastrous defeat in the Solomon Islands battle shows that the most important factor in the failure of the British and American strategies in Europe and Africa has been discovered in the Pacific.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Anniversary of the Tripartite Pact Japanese Prime Minister Issues Statement To Advance Rapidly Towards Victory with a Firm War Goal <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th Central News Agency Electric Japan signed a military alliance treaty with Germany and Italy on December 11 last year, that is, this day is the anniversary of the three countries working together to destroy the United Kingdom and the United States, and since then, the Greater East Asia War and the European War have been integrated, and advanced towards the road of defeating the United Kingdom and the United States and building a new world order. On the occasion of the anniversary, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo Hideki met with the German and Italian journalist groups at the Prime Minister's official residence at 4 pm on the 9th, and reiterated the noble belief of the three countries in signing the treaty and rebuilding the world, and answered questions with the German and Italian journalists for an hour. Now I record the questions and answers of Prime Minister Tojo to the journalist group as follows: I am very happy to have the opportunity to meet with the journalist groups of the allied countries Germany and Italy today. However, there may be some cases that cannot be answered about war opportunities. I am a soldier, and I cannot speak euphemistically. I will only answer frankly to what I know. (Question) The enemy countries United Kingdom and the United States, such as Churchill, went to Moscow, and Willkie also went to Chongqing from Moscow. How frequent are the exchanges? What is the Prime Minister's opinion? (Answer) On December 11 last year, Japan, Germany, and Italy signed a treaty to establish a solid alliance, and at the same time established the three major principles of completing the joint operation of the three countries against the United Kingdom and the United States, and the three countries will never make peace alone, and build a new world order. In this way, at the beginning of the war, the three countries had formed an alliance with complete common goals in everything, politically, and spiritually. Based on this, the three countries have recently achieved great results and continue to move forward. As a result, the United Kingdom and the United States, which have suffered repeated defeats, have become extremely panic and are running around, hoping to reverse the decline. If we observe the above situation, then the military, political, and diplomatic advantages of our three countries are superior to those of the enemy countries, which is needless to say. In addition, I would like to add that, in terms of the nature of this war, the purpose of the three countries' operations is based on morality. The three countries share a strong determination to break the old order of the past and build a new order, and are a group of countries advancing towards the same goal. This is the true meaning of the three countries. The United Kingdom and the United States are determined to maintain the old world order and preserve their own interests. The collapse of all selfish country groups is inevitable. (Question) At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the enemy's bases in East Asia were destroyed with the momentum of a whirlwind. What way will the war be conducted in the second year? (Answer) All groups have a firm war purpose when declaring war on foreign countries. Those who start a war without a purpose have never been seen. Since the start of the Greater East Asia War, Japan has completely captured all the strategic strongholds of the enemy countries United Kingdom and the United States in East Asia in the first year. The purpose of future operations is to cooperate with Germany and Italy and advance towards rapid victory. (Question) Has Japan actually applied the resources of the occupied southern region to complete the operation? (Answer) The southern resources obtained by Japan are currently being applied, and considerable results have been achieved in actual operations. (Answer) I heard that the amount of southern oil obtained has exceeded the initial expected amount. Is this true? (Answer) The amount of southern oil has indeed exceeded the initial expected amount. According to the speculation at the time of the outbreak of the war, the enemy forces would inevitably destroy all the oil fields. Therefore, the Japanese army was determined to re-excavate them when it occupied them. However, when seizing the oil field areas, it tried its best to prevent the enemy forces from destroying them. Therefore, it is not unrelated to the fact that the amount exceeded the expected amount this time. In short, with the cooperation of Japan, Germany, and Italy, there is no need to worry about the lack of oil in completing the war in East Asia.</p>
<p>Japanese, German, and Italian Foreign Ministers Give Broadcast Speeches Separately</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th Havas News Agency Electric In accordance with the spirit of the Triangular Alliance, Japan, Germany, and Italy will launch a campaign against the war leader President Roosevelt, which will mark the first anniversary.

The local radio station is scheduled to rebroadcast the speeches of the three at 7:15 pm to 7:45 pm. Radio stations in Japan, Italy, and other allied groups in Europe and Asia will also rebroadcast them.</p>
<p>Milan, 10th Havas News Agency Electric General Tojo Hideki, Prime Minister of Japan, sent a telegram to the Italian people, which was forwarded by the Tokyo correspondent of the "Italian Daily". The telegram was recently published in the newspaper, stating that Japan and Italy are now fighting side by side with Germany to promote the realization of common ideals. What are the ideals? It is to establish a new order in Asia and Europe, and eliminate the ambitions and hegemony of the United Kingdom and the United States. The entire Japanese people express unlimited admiration for the spirit of unity and the firm attitude of the Italian people. Japan will do its best to continue to achieve victory, enhance the friendship between Japan, Germany, and Italy, and conquer all the difficulties on the road ahead to achieve the goal of final victory.</p>

<h3 id="e4">In the Toropetz Region on the Eastern Front, the German Army is Making Smooth Progress Has Occupied Many Important Strongholds Soviet Troops in the Don River Bend Are Also Repelled <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Headquarters of the German Leader, 10th Havas News Agency Electric This afternoon, the German military report stated that the enemy's vanguard between the Volga River and the Don River was surrounded and annihilated. The Soviet army launched several counterattacks, suffering heavy losses and failing. In a certain area the day before yesterday, the Soviet army lost 104 tanks. The German army in the Don River bend repelled the attacking enemy forces and destroyed 16 enemy tanks. In the central section of Eastern Europe, our army's offensive has been quite successful, capturing hundreds of enemy soldiers and seizing a large number of military weapons and supplies. Although the enemy attempted to counterattack, it was ineffective. German fighter planes and dive bombers bombed enemy troops and railway facilities. The German Air Force commando destroyed 59 enemy bunkers. In the Losev area, the Soviet army lost 72 tanks.</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th Havas News Agency Electric The German army's counterattack in the Toropetz area in the central section of the Eastern Front is starting to surround the Soviet army's ten divisions. Many Soviet strongholds have fallen into the hands of the German army. According to the latest news, the Stalin Corps, which is well-equipped and well-trained, is also in danger of being surrounded. The Soviet command is transferring troops to the Toropetz area to resist the German army's patrol offensive.</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th Havas News Agency Electric According to military sources here: (1) The German army launched a large-scale counterattack in the Toropetz area in the central section of the Eastern Front yesterday and achieved great success. The German army advanced steadily, gaining large tracts of land and occupying many densely populated areas and important positions. Although some positions of the Red Army were deeply deployed, they were still occupied. The Red Army's rear transportation line was also cut off. Although it is difficult to draw a conclusion on the current battle, it can be predicted that the results may be to annihilate about ten divisions of the Red Army. This army is composed of the "Stalin Group Army" specializing in offensive warfare and mixed elite troops. The number of tanks, artillery, automobiles, and heavy weapons destroyed by the German army is still difficult to estimate, but this number is constantly increasing. The number of prisoners is also increasing. The German Air Force, braving the bad weather, continuously attacked the enemy troops, giving the army a major boost. (2) In the Don River bend area, the German armored forces counterattacked the attacking Red Army, destroying 46 of its tanks, including several weighing more than 52 tons. The German tank force rushed through the Red Army's assault teams and defeated the Red Army in a large area. The Red Army was forced to retreat in panic. The air force pursued and achieved good results. The battle in the area is still in progress. (3) Between the Volga and Don Rivers, the Red Army repeatedly attacked with large teams of tanks, with great momentum, but was defeated everywhere. The enemy lost 56 tanks. (4) On the south side of Lake Ilmen, the enemy's strength is limited and the offensive is not strong, failing to break through the main German defense line. The German heavy artillery defeated the enemy tanks in the area, preventing them from concentrating. A Red Army unit that was surrounded south of Perai City a few days ago has now been completely annihilated. Only a few troops broke through and fled into the nearby forest area. (5) The German positions north and south of Erzhev have also been strengthened. (6) A German reconnaissance plane in the Kalaki area reported that Red Army infantry had crossed the frozen river surface to reinforce and build artillery platforms. According to Red Army deserters, it was confirmed that the Red Army authorities are currently preparing to launch an offensive in the area. (7) On the Caucasus front, the Red Army concentrated a large army north of the Terek River in order to defend the right wing of the northeast front. The German army again inflicted heavy damage on the enemy yesterday, and several enemy teams were surrounded and annihilated.</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th Havas News Agency Electric From November 4 to December 2, the German army carried out a mopping-up operation in the forest and swamp area behind the central section of the Eastern Front, annihilating many remnants of the Soviet army, killing 992 people, and occupying 15 arsenals. The local residents did their best to cooperate with the German army.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 10th Central News Agency Electric The general budget for the 18th year of Showa has been decided by the cabinet meeting on the 10th and announced. The total amount of revenue and expenditure is 9.995 billion yen, an increase of more than 1.1 billion yen compared to the 17th year. The detailed figures are as follows: General budget for revenue and expenditure in the 18th year of Showa (unit: 1,000 yen), regular revenue 6,452,000, including general revenue 1,938,000, public debt 1,274,000, previous year's rolled-over funds incorporated 330,000, total 9,995,000, regular expenditure 4,932,000, temporary expenditure 5,063,000, total 9,995,000, revenue and expenditure are equal, general budget for expenditure of various ministries in the 18th year of Showa (unit: 1,000 yen), Imperial Household expenses regular 4,500, temporary none, total 4,500, Ministry of Foreign Affairs regular 13,000, temporary 31,000, total 44,000, Ministry of Home Affairs regular 634,000, temporary 339,000, total 974,000, Ministry of Finance regular 3,148,000, temporary 292,500, total 6,074,000, Ministry of the Army regular 600, temporary none, total 600, Ministry of the Navy regular 1,000, temporary none, total 1,000, Ministry of Justice regular 57,000, temporary 12,000, total 70,000, Ministry of Education regular 264,000, temporary 111,000, total 375,000, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry regular 71,000, temporary 509,000, total 580,000, Ministry of Commerce and Industry regular 9,000, temporary 723,000, total 732,000, Ministry of Communications regular 503,000, temporary 106,000, total 609,000, Ministry of Health and Welfare regular 180,000, temporary 151,000, total 332,000, Ministry of Greater East Asia regular 42,000, temporary 151,000, total 194,000, the total regular expenditure of the above ministries is 4,932,000, the temporary expenditure is 7,063,000, and the total is 9,996,000.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th Central News Agency Electric In the general accounting revenue budget estimate for the next year, the regular part is 645.2 billion yen, the temporary part is 354.2 billion yen, the tax revenue for the regular part and the temporary part is 696.8 billion yen, an increase of 104.7 billion yen compared to the current year's 592.1 billion yen, an increase of about 17% compared to the current tax rate. In addition, the general revenue for the next year is 142.3 billion yen, an increase of 86 million yen compared to the current year's 133.6 billion yen. In addition, the public debt for the next year is 127.4 billion yen, a decrease of 25.1 billion yen compared to the current year's 152.6 billion yen. Judging only from the deficit public debt, the decrease is 25.2 billion yen. In addition, the surplus of 330 million yen in the general accounting of the previous year is rolled into the next year. The revenue budget for the current year is incorporated into 54 million yen. This time, there is no incorporation of borrowed funds. In short, the revenue budget for the next year is mainly based on increasing tax revenue to pay for most of the increase in expenditure. Therefore, the revenue for the next year is reduced by the revenue from the surplus to reduce the issuance of deficit public debt, that is, the tax revenue for the next year is 696.8 (unit: million yen), the current year is 592, and the comparison shows an increase of 104.7. Other general revenue for the next year is 142.2, and the current year is 133.6, and the comparison shows an increase of 86. The public debt for the next year is 127.4, and the current year is 152.6, and the comparison shows a decrease of 251. The road public debt for the next year is 18, and the current year is 17, an increase of 1. The deficit public debt for the next year is 125.5, and the current year is 150.7, a decrease of 252. The surplus of the current year is rolled into the next year by 330, the current year is none, an increase of 330.

<h3 id="e7">Food Production Increase in Southern Shandong Province: Overview <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Jinan, 10th (Central News Agency) - Shandong Province occupies an important position in North China, so a self-sufficient food system is critical.  In January of this year, to implement emergency food production increase measures, the Shandong Provincial Emergency Food Production Increase Implementation Committee was established within the Provincial Government.  The following is a summary of the situation of food production increase in Shandong Province over the past year: (1) Well drilling: The total number of wells allocated for this year is 36,000. By the end of September, 90% had been completed. Adding the number of wells drilled independently by various counties, the number had exceeded the allocated number by 16% by the end of September. Therefore, by the end of this year, it is expected to reach 44,000 wells, which can irrigate approximately one million mu of farmland. From this, it is estimated that there will be a considerable increase in the yield of wheat and miscellaneous grains. (2) Land improvement: As a result of land improvement, the yield of wheat per mu of dry land has increased by approximately 150 jin, and the yield of rice per mu of paddy field has increased by approximately one shi and eight sheng. Regarding land improvement work, since March of this year, 1,360,000 yuan has been invested in improving 490 hectares of paddy fields.</p>

<h3 id="e21">The Lives of Inland Elementary School Teachers Under High Commodity Prices: Teacher morale is affected, and schools face extreme difficulty in hiring teachers <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, the rapid rise in commodity prices in the mainland has made life increasingly difficult for those engaged in education. Taking elementary schools as an example, although teacher salaries have nominally increased, they inevitably lag behind the unlimited rise in commodity prices. The hardship they endure is not difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>There is a Cantonese saying that describes the hardship of elementary school teachers: "If you're not desperately poor, don't teach; if you're not starving, don't eat leftovers." To compare teaching to eating leftovers is truly a cause for sorrow!</p>
<p>The hardship of elementary school teachers' lives not only affects the morale of current teachers but also greatly affects the hiring of new teachers. The greatest pain for elementary school principals in the mainland now is their inability to hire teachers. Some elementary schools are nearing the end of the semester, but teacher vacancies still cannot be filled. This situation is quite common, and its severity cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Guangxi Province has always valued grassroots education, and it constantly improves the salaries of grassroots education personnel and adopts a system of requisitioning goods in kind. For example, in some counties, elementary school teachers receive a living allowance of more than 30 yuan per month from the county government and are also entitled to receive 80 jin of rice (some receive 50 or 60 jin), collected from households by the town office. Such treatment makes it difficult to maintain even a minimum standard of personal living, but village and street chiefs often delay the payment of rice, so teachers are unable to solve their food problems and have to borrow from the kitchen. After a long time, the kitchen is also unable to support them, which will inevitably affect the teaching progress of the entire school. Some schools even open their doors in name only but are actually at a standstill. As for counties and cities that do not issue goods in kind but instead issue cash allowances, the situation is often similar. This phenomenon is not unique to Guangxi Province; other provinces are also like this. Here are a few examples to show a glimpse of the situation:</p>
<p>(1) A teacher from the Suqiao Township Central School in Lingui County reported: "...The problem of living here is difficult to solve. My salary is 36 yuan per month paid by the county government, and I also receive 50 jin of rice collected from various villages. But since February of this year, I have not been able to receive a single grain of rice. Most of my colleagues are locals and can still get help from their families, but I am from another town and am penniless, so how can I survive?"</p>
<p>(2) A teacher from a central school in Yongfu County reported: "…Our monthly living expenses rely on the government providing a few dozen yuan in salary and on students donating some rice or loaning money, but many poor students cannot afford it. At present, it is not enough to maintain the necessary nutrition. We no longer dare to hope to eat vegetables, let alone meat, and only hope to eat white rice. But because not much rice is cooked, after the last class bell rings every morning and afternoon, the teachers in the classroom, regardless of whether they have finished the lesson, all rush to the dining hall to grab rice to eat. The impact on students' studies and psychology is very great."</p>
<p>(3) A supervisory official in Liujiang County reported: "...The principal of the central school in the town was dismissed by the county government because the town chief could not issue rice as promised, so he led all the teachers of the school to question the town chief."</p>
<p>The income of elementary school teachers in Guangdong Province is about 80 or 90 yuan per month for those who are paid well, and only 30 or 40 yuan for those who are paid less. There is also a distinction between "directly affiliated" and "non-directly affiliated" schools. Teaching in "directly affiliated" schools is naturally more likely to receive preferential treatment. In addition, Guangdong also has a "school rice" system, which collects one catty of rice per month from each student, but because the collection methods vary greatly from place to place and there are many difficulties, it is not easy to achieve fairness, so the lives of teachers are still difficult to stabilize.</p>
<p>Secondly, due to the lack of funds for elementary schools, it is impossible to achieve complete equipment. In some remote counties, in addition to broken-down buildings, there is simply no equipment to speak of. Even newspapers are missing. Teachers are in closed countryside and have no contact with the outside world. They are ignorant of the major domestic situation and international trends. The spiritual pain is no less than the material difficulties.</p>
<p>In recent years, the Ministry of Education of the Chongqing government has repeatedly issued announcements emphasizing education, promoting national education, and improving teacher salaries. The pronouncements are voluminous and logical, and the educational expenditures are even more considerable. However, the treatment of elementary school teachers, who bear the mission of grassroots education, is still just lip service, with no action taken. How can it be called promoting education? How can it be called making improvements?</p>
<h3 id="e22">Cooking Oil on Sale Today: Sugar Purchase Restrictions Relaxed: Oil Stores Merged for Sale to Facilitate Supervision: Each Household Can Purchase 40 Yuan Worth of Sugar with Housing Tax Receipt <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the supply of the two daily necessities, oil and sugar, solutions have been found. Oil has been transported from Pudong to Shanghai and will be sold today. Restrictions on sugar purchases have also been relaxed. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>The Shanghai Cooking Oil Industry Wholesale Office has already allocated 5,500 dan out of the 10,000 dan of cooking oil ordered last month. The remaining 4,500 dan were recently loaded at the Pudong warehouse and transported to Shanghai for distribution to various retail oil stores. It was originally planned to be sold by various oil stores yesterday, but because the procedures could not be completed immediately, permission was granted to continue retail sales today.</p>
<p>Soybean Oil and Rapeseed Oil Sold Simultaneously</p>
<p>The method remains the same, with each person limited to half a jin per day. The cooking oil allocated to each oil store must be completely sold out according to the daily sales quantity. In order to prevent retailers from cheating, the office will merge more than 800 retail stores with daily sales volume of more than one dan into more than 300, and send personnel to supervise the sales separately. As for smaller retail stores, an inspection system will be adopted. Citizens are encouraged to report any violations. The oil sold this time is divided into two types: soybean oil and rapeseed oil. Soybean oil sells for 3.6 yuan per half jin, and rapeseed oil sells for 3.1 yuan.</p>
<p>Sugar</p>
<p>In order to maintain the supply of sugar in Shanghai, the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office is making every effort to smooth the sugar supply channels. In addition to the more than 60,000 bags of sugar that have already arrived in Shanghai, 500,000 bags of Philippine sugar and sugar stored in Hong Kong have been agreed upon to be transported to Shanghai in batches for supply. The sugar allocation to Class A retail merchants and Class B users will be increased to maintain the legitimate needs of the market. The method for retailers to obtain sugar for sale has been improved, the sales volume has been increased, and it is stipulated that purchasers should distribute it to the attached households in their residences. This will be implemented starting today. The announcement is recorded as follows: "It has been found that in addition to the purchase of sugar with citizen certificates still following the original regulations, regarding the purchase of sugar with housing tax receipts, this office has formulated that it should be distributed based on the number of people in the entire household, naturally including attached households (i.e., three-room tenants). Now that the second phase has begun, in order to popularize the use of sugar for food households, this office will stipulate the following methods starting from the 11th of this month:"</p>
<p>Sugar Purchase Method Based on Housing Tax Receipt</p>
<p>(1) The housing tax receipts used by food households to purchase sugar are stipulated on the left and will be stamped with a triangular stamp by the sales supervisor on the blank corner of the receipts at the time of purchase to avoid duplication. A. Those residing in the International Settlement and the Hongkou and West Shanghai areas will still use the current autumn housing tax receipt. B. Those residing in the French Concession will still use the September-October housing tax receipt. C. Those residing in Zhabei will still use the autumn housing tax receipt. Those without housing tax receipts may use household registration certificates. D. This period is limited to purchasing sugar from the second phase. Those who did not purchase sugar from the first phase will not be allowed to purchase it retroactively.</p>
<p>Each Household Can Purchase 40 Yuan Worth of Sugar</p>
<p>(2) With the above housing tax receipts, each food household can purchase sugar up to 40 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. For the convenience of packaging and carrying, each store is allowed to divide it into four packages of 10 yuan each (including 2% retail tax). Each package contains 2.4 jin of white sugar or 2.6 jin of brown sugar. However, those in Zhabei who purchase with household registration certificates are still limited to 5 yuan per household registration certificate, equivalent to 1.2 jin of white sugar or 1.3 jin of brown sugar.</p>
<p>Purchased Sugar Should Be Evenly Distributed</p>
<p>(3) If there are attached households in the household of the person who purchased the sugar with the housing tax receipt, it should be distributed fairly and evenly according to the number of households. There should be no taking advantage. If there is a refusal to distribute fairly, the attached households (i.e., three-room tenants) are allowed to report to this office (23 Tongyun Street, French Concession, telephone 83300) or to the nearby authorities for investigation.</p>
<p>Retail Stores Sales Volume</p>
<p>(4) Stores that sell sugar with housing tax receipts have already been designated by this office as either "selling sugar every day" or "selling sugar every other day" based on the amount allocated. Each store should clearly mark "This store sells sugar every day," "This store sells sugar every other day," or "This store sells sugar on odd days" on the storefront for identification. Those selling sugar every day will still sell one-thirtieth of the total amount allocated to them. Those selling sugar every other day will sell one-fifteenth of the total amount allocated to them each time.</p>

<p>The Silver and Money Industry Association issued a notice to its member banks and money houses: "Dear Sirs/Madams, According to Article 6 of the Provisional Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions by the Ministry of Finance, 'Financial institutions shall deposit the reserve for payment deposits into the Central Reserve Bank in accordance with regulations.'

<p>The current Shanghai Municipal Council mark and armband were created in 1870. However, according to the results of the Shanghai Municipal Council meeting the other night, the style will be changed and will soon be announced and implemented. Manpower vehicles in Nanshi are allowed to enter the French Concession. After manpower vehicles from the Public Concession and the French Concession successively entered Nanshi, the traffic between the concessions and Nanshi has become more convenient, which directly and indirectly helps the prosperity of Nanshi. It is learned that vehicles in Nanshi have now been approved by the French Municipal Council and, after obtaining vehicle licenses, are allowed to enter the concession. Therefore, a large number of manpower vehicles from Nanshi have already entered the entire French Concession in recent days.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Shanghai Materials Control Committee Reorganized: New Commodity Price Countermeasures Determined: Implemented in Conjunction with Established Currency Policy: All Industrial and Commercial Organizations Ordered to Implement <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Government recently received an order from the Executive Yuan to promulgate the Organizational Regulations of the Central Commodity Price Countermeasures Committee and the draft Organizational Rules of the Local Commodity Price Countermeasures Committee. Considering that the existing Shanghai Materials Control Committee is no longer suitable, a special order was issued to reorganize it in accordance with the Organizational Rules of the Local Commodity Price Countermeasures Committee and to determine the basic guidelines for commodity price management countermeasures as follows:</p>
<p>Establish the Foundation of Reserve Currency Control</p>
<p>(1) Commodity price management countermeasures should be implemented in conjunction with the promotion of the new currency system policy. The main purpose is to seek reasonable material allocation management and maintain fair and stable commodity prices in order to stabilize people's livelihoods and increase production. (2) In the New Legal Tender circulation area, in accordance with the established policy of promoting the new currency system, efforts should be made to break the liberalism of the old legal tender and actively establish the controlled economic foundation of the new legal tender so that currency policy and commodity price countermeasures complement each other to form a stable core for commodity prices. (3) In order to stabilize people's livelihoods, it is appropriate to implement a considerable low-price policy. At the same time, in order to prevent materials from flowing to different areas with higher commodity prices, in addition to the necessary military measures, special economic blockade methods should be sought.</p>
<p>All Industrial and Commercial Organizations Should Implement</p>
<p>(4) Commodity price countermeasures, with the maintenance of fair prices as the central task, should consider the actual situation in all aspects at any time to maintain fair and stable commodity prices. It is not appropriate to adhere to a fixed low-price policy, which will hinder the smooth flow of materials, encourage the accumulation of hoarding, and even promote the flow of materials to different areas. (5) What should be especially considered in commodity price countermeasures is that the source of materials that have always relied on overseas imports has been cut off. Therefore, we should actively strive to increase production to replace them, and the increase in the production of daily necessities is especially necessary. At the same time, we should thoroughly implement the protection of resources and the conservation of consumption. (6) Commodity price management countermeasures should adopt a key-point approach and gradually promote them. The implementation area should start with major cities. The implementation of materials should be carried out step by step in a practical manner for daily necessities, military supplies, export products, and important materials related to resource development. The objects of management and guidance should be all industrial and commercial organizations.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Ineffective Mediation of Rent Leads to Water Shutoff - Landlord Unable to Cover Costs - Tenants Oppose Rent Increase <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Houses numbered 66 to 76 on Beiling De Si Road (newly built at the intersection of Rue Petain and Avenue Joffre) originally had a monthly rent of 60 yuan per unit. However, due to the landlord's inability to cover expenses, they requested a rent increase from the sub-landlords, which was refused. Consequently, the landlord appealed to the French authorities for mediation. However, the sub-landlords in that area adopted a non-cooperative attitude, forcing the French Municipal Council to suspend water supply starting from the 9th as a warning.</p>
<p>Mediation Failure</p>
<p>It is reported that the rent issue in that area was investigated by the French authorities several months ago. The investigation revealed that the landlord was not only unable to profit but was also incurring losses due to high water costs. The tenants' monthly rent of 60 yuan was disproportionately low compared to the value of the 70,000 yuan properties they occupied. Therefore, after research by the French police, it was suggested that the rent per house should be calculated based on the number of occupants, with an increase of 1.30 yuan per person. However, this proposal was rejected by all tenants (most of whom are wealthy Chinese merchants).</p>
<p>Water Shutoff Warning</p>
<p>The landlord stated that they could no longer afford the high water costs and requested another investigation by the French authorities, stating that they were unwilling to continue incurring monthly losses. Finally, with the assistance of the French authorities, the water supply to the tenants was cut off yesterday to urge them to increase the rent slightly or bear the water costs themselves. According to an official from the French Concession's Rent Mediation Committee, the authorities' strict action was a warning to those who disobey reasonable mediation.</p>

<h3 id="e29">Alert and Control Measures Already in Place - Baojia Should Pay Attention to the Following Points - Curtains Should be Wider Than Windows - Lookout Towers Should Be Aware of Objects Dropped <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The baojia offices in all districts of the Public Concession have received an urgent notice from the police station announcing a state of alert and control from today. The General Baojia of the Zhabei District has also notified all Lianbao (joint baojia) to inform their respective baojia heads to pay special attention to seven key points to ensure thorough control.</p>
<p>Cover Skylights</p>
<p>(1) During the last drill, most of the curtains in each household were substandard and should be at least one foot wider than the window on each side to prevent light from escaping. (2) Many rooms have skylights that are not covered. Failure to cover skylights negates the effectiveness of other window coverings. Strict attention should be paid to this. (3) Large buildings such as hotels and department stores have many windows, making management difficult. These buildings must be divided into smaller areas, each assigned to a person responsible for covering the windows or turning off the lights upon hearing an alert to prevent chaos. (4) After the street lights are dimmed, only a few newly installed air-raid lights should be left on in the alleys. The minimum number of lights needed should be determined in advance and reported to the General Baojia, which will then inform the police station for approval.</p>
<p>Lookout Points</p>
<p>(5) During air-raid drills, announcements are broadcast by radio stations, so each baojia office must have a radio (borrowed from residents if not purchased) to receive orders and relay them to the jia heads and residents. (6) During the previous air-raid drill, one model bao was established in each Lianbao. Two more model bao must be established quickly in addition to the existing one. (7) The method for establishing lookout towers was explained in the previously issued Provisional Guidelines for Air Raid Lighting Control. Previously, the focus was on covering the lights in each household, but now, attention must also be paid to the bomb proxies dropped from the aircraft during the air-raid drill. The total number of items must be identified, the location of each noted, and retrieved as possible.</p>

<h3 id="e38">Tight Monetary Policy Remains - Chinese Stocks Fall Across the Board <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese stock market experienced a widespread decline yesterday due to the continued tight monetary policy. The recent surge in prices prompted many to sell and cash out, intensifying the downward trend. Despite activity from new and old investors, the momentum has waned. The approaching Lunar New Year is also a factor in the decline. The outlook is unlikely to improve easily. The decline was most pronounced in the public utilities sector, with Chinese stocks once falling to the 40 yuan level. Zhabei Water and Electricity fell by 2.5 yuan. The textile industry also suffered a setback due to falling yarn prices. Wing On Textiles fell by nearly 40 yuan. Dasheng Mills Nos. 1 and 3 saw selling pressure and bucked the trend, maintaining strength. Small-denomination stocks also softened again. The department store sector was quiet, with Xinhua stocks trading flat. Xinhua new shares plunged by 6 yuan. The Great China Match also rebounded slightly by 2.5 yuan. Nanyang Tobacco plunged by 4 yuan, falling below 130 yuan. Huacheng Tobacco was at 355 yuan. In the new pharmaceutical sector, only Five Continents Pharmacy rose by 5 yuan, while most others retreated. Xinyi fell below 300 yuan. Minyi fell by 6 yuan to nearly 90 yuan. Zhongfa fell by 0.25 yuan. Xinya fell by 2 yuan. The transaction price for Guohua Bank was between 160 and 170 yuan. Meilin Food had buyers at 1,100 yuan. In the cultural sector, Zhonghua alone rose by 2.5 yuan, while Commerce and World both declined. Trading was weak. The market price list for today is recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Government Bond Prices Fall <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Although there has been no market for government bonds recently, prices have fluctuated from time to time, but these are not standard prices, as only a very small number of people are doing spot transactions. Therefore, market prices vary greatly from place to place and from building to building. The highest price traded within the day was slightly over 60 yuan, and the lowest was 55 yuan. Yesterday's price was around 57 or 58 yuan, not far from the ceiling price of 50 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e40">There is Little Demand for Gold Ornaments <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold ornament retail price at the Dahsin Gold Shop and other shops in the city was 3,350 yuan per tael, unchanged. The buy-back price was reduced by about 300 yuan. The price difference was significant, indicating a further decline in the unofficial market price among traders. The price opened at 3,270 yuan in the morning, down 40 yuan. The situation was characterized by little demand. By noon, it was difficult to sell even at 3,200 yuan, a difference of 1,100 yuan from the previous day. Transaction volume was low. The price of silver ornaments remained at 16 yuan per tael, with traders buying and selling at 18.5 and 19 yuan, respectively. The money changers' association interest rate remained unchanged at 1.4 fen.</p>
<p>Military scrip remained stable and firm. The inter-dealer price was 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, 3 li and 5 hao. The retail selling price at banks and small money changers remained at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 6 fen, with the buy-back price also rising to 5 fen.</p>

<p>Factory Cloth Yesterday, the cloth market saw little trading as traders were busy registering inventory. Sellers continued to release stock, causing the market to soften. 16-pound Earth brand coarse cloth was 253 yuan, 14-pound Earth brand was 222 yuan, 9-pound Xinhua brand was 138 yuan, and 8-pound Zhenzhong brand was 135 yuan. In the morning market, 12-pound Earth brand fine cloth traded at 188.75 yuan, and later traded at 188 yuan. The price of Dapeng Fine Cloth also needed to be between 188 yuan and 9 yuan. The price of peach-colored ladies' poplin fell to as low as 295 yuan, closing at 302 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, the price rebounded to 306.5 yuan due to the excessive decline.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth Yesterday, the downward trend continued. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth new orders were 191 yuan, and bank orders were 192.75 yuan, a further decline of 0.25 to 0.5 yuan per bolt. Colorful Ball was 193.25 yuan, Flying Fish was 191.5 yuan, Yang Crane was 191 yuan, Trumpet was 191 yuan, and Five Blessings was 190.5 yuan. Mid-range brands remained relatively stable. However, the Four Gentlemen beaverteen red order had too many floating quantities from retail customers, causing it to decline despite attempts to increase the price. The final price traded at 7.63 yuan, a decline of 7 fen.</p>

<p>Sunflower seeds were initially loose in Shanghai because the production price was more appropriate in Shanghai. However, as sales became more active, the market tightened.

The guild, concerned about the endless rise in prices and its impact on the livelihoods of ordinary people, has banned non-industry people from entering the market since yesterday.

<p>There is extraordinarily minimal transactions of steel plates, 2.5-cent to 7.5-cent plates and old oil-pool plates. Shipyards and ironworks are hardly drawing down.

<h3 id="e46">Thoughts on "Jiang Zhou Weep Blood Record" <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>— Mei Bo</p>
<p>"Jiang Zhou Weep Blood Record" was originally called "Roar, China!". It is said that it has been performed twice in Shanghai before, but unfortunately, I didn't have the opportunity to attend, so I can't compare the impressions of the two. This time, it emphasizes the anti-British and American aspect, and it seems that many contents have been deleted. Some scenes are therefore inevitably monotonous. For example, in the second scene of the first act, the American Aslai quarrels with the boatman and even drowns. The whole conversation is only five or six sentences, and the performance is at most five minutes. It stands to reason that it would be enough for the captain (played by Yan Jun) to say a word, but now it is made into an independent scene, which seems too uneconomical. Maybe that's how the original work was; that would be the original author's negligence.</p>
<p>Looking at the whole play, I think the first and second acts are better than the other two acts. Maybe this is my preference. I always think that an artistic work, rather than inserting many speeches, would rather appeal to the audience's intuition, move their hearts, and make them completely intoxicated by the work. For example, in the first act, there are many satirical dialogues, which are very clever. The audience will often smile knowingly when they hear it. The dialogue of several boatmen in the third act is intimate and humane, and it is also worthy of our careful aftertaste.</p>
<p>In terms of directing, Mr. Li Pingyi has put in a lot of effort, but I think it's a bit "poor" for movie stars to perform dramas. An obvious fact is that among the stars who participated in this performance, those who took drama as their "mother's home" generally performed better than the real old stars. Doesn't this just illustrate the particularity of drama?</p>
<p>As for the individual acting skills of the actors, I especially like Yan Jun's captain. Yan Jun's lines are extremely intonated, enough to express the captain's invincible power. Lu Shan's lines are also very smooth, but unfortunately, there are not many scenes. Zhang Wan, who plays the wife of Boatman B, always grasped the consistent emotions, which is commendable. Xu Li's old boatman is not tepid and stops at the right time, which seems to be better than the one who played the old man (I didn't see Jiang Ming). The most inexplicable character on the cast list is Lao Fei. It seems that it is difficult to find such a knowledgeable boatman in the reality of China. As for the Taoist Yin (seems to be Zhou Wenbin that day?), the Huang translator, the characters are not as prominent as the previous ones, so I will not discuss them here. Unmanned</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>— Unmanned</p>
<p>"Jiang Zhou Weep Blood Record" is adapted by Xiao Ping based on the original "Roar, China!" by the Soviet futurist poet Cui Lai Tai Jiaofu, directed by Li Pingqian. The whole play has four acts. The first act is a warship, the second act is the Taoist Yin's office, the third act is the boatman's association, and the fourth act is the cemetery and execution ground. The performers, in addition to Lu _, are mostly actors from "Zhonglian".</p>
<p>The story took place in Wanxian in June 1924. Because of a boatman, Ji Changxing, a quarrel unfortunately capsized the sampan and drowned the poor American gentleman, Ah Kanlai, who did not know how to swim. So, the _ _ people put forward an "ultimatum" and demanded that the Chinese authorities accept four harsh conditions. One of the conditions was: Two innocent boatmen must be executed without legal trial.</p>
<p>I remember in the autumn of September 22, I watched the "Roar, China!" performed by the Shanghai Drama Association at the Golden Grand Theater, directed by Ying Yunwei. The cast was tight and strong, and the quality of the script was sound, so I was very satisfied. At that time, I was only sixteen years old, and my emotions were overflowing. For the last scene of the play, the execution of two boatmen, I almost really cried in the theater!</p>
<p>This time, I watched "Jiang Zhou Weep Blood Record" again. Ten years have passed. In the past ten years, I have groped in the struggle of being oppressed, I have struggled in a painful environment, and I remember "Roar, China!".</p>
<p>From the first act to the fourth act, I was always surrounded by serious emotions. Here, there is blood, there are tears, and there is a young man's jumping heart.</p>
<p>The directing technique is quite easy. In terms of actors, Jiang Ming's Lao Fei and Yan Jun's Captain are the most successful. Jiang Ming's dialogue with Daoyin in the second act is truly "tearful", and Yan Jun's consistent foreign-style arrogance vividly portrays the outlines, personality, and actions of foreigners. Others such as Lu Yuzhi's boatman, Xu Li's old boatman, Gu Yelu's Huang translator, Zhang Wan's boatman's wife, Zhou Weibin's Daoyin, and Lu Shan's captain's wife can also be in line with their identities and are very stable. Hong Jingling, Qin Tong, Zhou Qi, Xu Xinyuan, Cang Yinqiu, Guan Hongda, Han Langen, Zhang Zhizhi, Chen Qi, etc., did not have many scenes and did not perform well.</p>
<p>The sets and props are exquisite. The waves in the second scene of the first act and the floating clouds in the third act are very cleverly lit, and the effect is very good. For example, the sound of the wind, the sound of throwing anchors, and the sound of dogs barking are all like the real thing.</p>
<p>"Jiang Zhou Weep Blood Record" is a special harvest for the drama circle this year.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Chen Dawei Goes to the Old Capital <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Young actor Chen Dawei performed in the Tianchan Theater last month and made his debut. His reputation was good, and the media regarded him as a prodigy in the Peking Opera world. Since the performance at Tianchan ended, his friends Hu Guoqiao, Lou Longhou, and Ping Opera artists Su Shaoqing, _ Huaguanzhu, Zheng Guoyi, and Fan Shi Ren have all advocated that Chen should go north to observe, learn from teachers and discuss, in order to further his studies. It is reported that Chen has decided to leave Shanghai for the old capital on the 11th of this month to specialize in Peking Opera, learn from teachers, and sing. He plans to form a troupe and return to the south in a year to meet with the people of Shanghai again. With Chen's talent and perseverance, he will surely shine in the Peking Opera world in the future. On the 6th of this month, the Aurora University Winter Clothing Solicitation Committee held a charity Peking Opera concert, and Chen was invited to perform the play "Battle of Taiping" as a farewell memorial. The colleagues of this newspaper set up a banquet for Chen to bid him farewell and strengthen his courage. It is said that the famous amateur actor Fan Shiren will accompany Chen to the north.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Desires After the Resumption of Publication of Shen Bao <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Jingwan</p>
<p>I have lived in Shanghai for forty-nine years. I have always loved reading newspapers and books. After work, I would always bring a newspaper back home to read carefully in the quiet of the night. After reading, I would classify and clip them, and I have done this every day for thirty years without interruption. Later, due to the war and environmental factors, they were all lost in fires, which I find very regrettable. Shanghai Daily's Shen Bao was the earliest newspaper. I have been friends with it for more than thirty years, and the benefits I have gained from it are countless. Therefore, Shen Bao is nothing less than my good teacher and helpful friend. Now that it has resumed publication, I am both celebrating the return of my good teacher and helpful friend to my side and briefly outlining my hopes, hoping that we can encourage each other.</p>

<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(2) The Enemy</p>
<p>Huang Long thanked him. The father asked Wang Shun where he was. The helper pointed and said, "It's just ahead. There's a glass lamp at the door with red characters written on the glass. A big character 'Wang', and the two smaller characters 'Shun Xing'. Do you recognize the characters?" Wei Cheng said from behind, "I recognize the characters. Okay, we'll go ourselves, thank you." Wei Cheng said and walked ahead of Huang Long. The shops on both sides of the street were closing, blocking the meager lamplight from the doorways with their doors. The two stumbled past, one foot high, one foot low, until they reached the crossroads. Huang Long raised his hand and slapped his head. Wei Cheng turned around and asked, "What are you doing?" Huang Long said, "What Wang Shun Xing, Li Shun Xing, it's actually Wang Crazy's teahouse, I remember now. Turn north, I recognize it." Huang Long rushed ahead of Wei Cheng, turned the corner, and laughed, "It's just ahead, no need to look at the characters on the lamp anymore. I've fought here before." He walked a few steps past, and Wei Cheng still looked up to take a look. Sure enough, there was a lamp, but it wasn't lit, and it was impossible to tell what was written on it. He walked in from a threshold where half of a table was under the eaves and half of the table was inside. He suddenly realized that the facade of this Wang Shun Xing Inn was a teahouse, and the inside of Wang Crazy's teahouse was the Wang Shun Xing Inn.</p>
<p>Huang Long was in front, walking under the dim wall lamp, leading Wei Cheng into a glass door. The glass was very bright, so bright that you could see thirteen or fourteen plasters plastered all over the cracks. Huang Long nodded to the person inside the door. An old man sitting at the counter came to greet them. Huang Long said, "We want a room, any number of beds will do." The old man said, "Yes, yes, yes." He led them to a room behind a screen. Huang Long said, "Where's the lamp?" The old man said, "Coming, coming, don't be in a hurry, guests. Where are you from?" Huang Long said, "We were gambling during the day, we came from the gambling place." The lamp came, illuminating the room, which had only two beds. Huang Long went to push open two short windows to take a look. It was a narrow alley, and the lamplight reflected onto the wall outside the window. Wei Cheng kept saying, "Very good, very good, are you the owner? We'll go get dinner and come back." The old man laughed and said, "Yes, I'm Wang Crazy, but I'm not crazy at all. That's what people call me, so that's what I answer to. If the guests are going out for dinner, don't worry about not finding a place to eat." (239)</p>
<h3 id="e50">Memoirs of the Defeat in Malaya （） <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— Lieutenant General Percival's Memoirs</p>
<p>Memoirs of Lieutenant General Percival, Former Commander of the British Army in Malaya</p>
<p>The campaign to capture Malaya and Singapore was our first objective in the Greater East Asia War and also the greatest achievement of the year. After the fall of Singapore, Britain began the first step in a complete retreat in East Asia, and we also took the first step towards a brilliant victory. Before the war, the United Kingdom and the United States regarded this as one of their strongholds and boasted that the defense was very complete. However, before long after the declaration of war, my brave soldiers had completed the desperate "landing in front of the enemy" on the east coast of the Malay Peninsula, such as Singora and Kota Bharu; furthermore, in Slim, Jitra, and Kukup, they continued to repel the stubborn resistance of the enemy, regardless of the severe heat. Or they went deep into the untouched wilderness forests. The 1,100-kilometer distance to Singapore (which is the same distance between Tokyo and Shimonoseki) was breached in a short period of only fifty-five days. The advance was like a hot knife through butter, and the historic capture of the fortress, including the siege of Singapore, was completed in seventy days! It has been exactly one year since the war began. Lieutenant General A.B. Percival, the surrendered commander of the British Army in Malaya, published the following full text of "Memoirs of the Malayan Campaign" as a prisoner of war in a certain location. As Percival said, "The defense of my car has reached the ultimate state of perfection." In this impregnable British position, my loyal generals actually completed the landing operation. This article describes this point vividly, which is worthy of our attention. In addition, the fierce fighting of the Tobi unit in the Kota Bharu area, the "breakthrough" of the Saeki and other units on the Jitra line on the Kedah line, and the gradual defeat of the enemy forces after the naval mobile units and air force attacked the most stubbornly resistant northern part of Kukup area were all vividly described in this article. This path of the enemy's retreat is the scroll of our victory. Looking back on the past, we must strengthen our determination to destroy Britain and the United States.</p>
