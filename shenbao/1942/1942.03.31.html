<h3>爲生活奮鬥　林吉姆擦鞋</h3>
<p>— 也非</p>
<p>十多年前，上海曾發生女學生吳愛蓉熱戀啞靑年林吉姆的戀愛公案，報章宣傳，引爲美談，而有情人總成眷屬，尤足使人興奮。然不數年，林吳兩人又以離婚風潮，轟動社會，後雖經伍澄宇律師及親友之調解，得吿破鏡重圓，然啞夫婦間之情感，則日見冷淡，無復當年戀愛時山盟海誓偕白頭之熱烈矣。</p>
<p>前天，當我行經大世界的時候，突然在那一長排的擦鞋人中間，瞧見了兩個聾啞人在打着手勢，我對啞吧們的手勢話本來懂得一些，這時不免動了我好奇的心情，便停止了脚步向他倆凝視着，大概他們覺察到我在看他，其中一個就停止了他們的手談，向我打個招呼，意思是問我要擦鞋嗎？在他那張帶有西洋人風度的面龐上，我恍惚地想起這個人以前似乎曾經在那兒見面過的，一縷回憶突然繞上我的腦際，我唐突地在手心上寫了幾個字問他：</p>
<p>「你是啞情人林吉姆嗎？」</p>
<p>對面的那個聾啞朋友搶着代他點頭回答。瞧着林吉姆時，裝着笑的臉上頗流露着不自然的神色。爲了要想知道一點啞情人的現狀，以及做擦鞋匠的原因，我獲得了林吉姆的同意，坐在那張給顧客們用的帆布凳上，開始了我們半手勢半筆談的問答。</p>
<p>「你倆現在的感情可好嗎？我問」。</p>
<p>「還好。」他微笑地向我點首，但一會兒他英雋的臉上完全爲一片愁雲籠罩了，略縐着眉，開始筆述他的一切：　（未完）</p>

<p>是在　　冠下邊，那無數紅艷的苞片，紫藍的花朶，團團的簇聚成那肥大稠密的花球。花是雌雄同株，雄蕊黃色，子房下位，有三室。雌蕊受精後，子房便逐漸脹大，變成多肉質的，最後一切子房彼此緊緊的結合在一齊，以致形成一個狀如松毬的那圓或橢圓的果實，長約四五寸，始靑，成熟時紫或黃，這便是我們平常所吃的那甘酸而別有風味的波羅蜜了。　（未完）</p>

<h3>從小處做起</h3>
<p>— 維摩</p>
<p>勿以善小而不為，這是教人對於任何小事情都要去體騐力行的一句名言。如果一個人眞能件件事，不論小到怎樣的一件事，下決心而持之以恆的去做，給果一定會弄得很好。最近在街頭巷尾看到眞正的從小」處做起的一件事，不妨紀在下而，以證我言之不謬。</p>
<p>誰都知道，在馬路上尙未普設公廁所的上海，弄堂角裹最討厭而最沒有辦法的，莫過於大家到處小便。不要說遍地「金黃」，講渠「洋溢」，行人掩鼻而過；就是那牆壁上也弄得五花百門，「書畫」琳琅，不堪寓目，十足表現出　和懶的病根。而且這種舉動，一經有人發起，日夜踵接而來，大有戶限（假定有的話）為穿之勢。這不能不說市容上的一大污點了。</p>
<p>最近在鄰近的弄堂裹，忽然發現一個奇蹟，那一所遠年老坑竟然被消滅了，而且時懇並不長，只有三天工夫，一個陰暗骯髒的所在，恢復了它　根壁角的本來面目。從此行人稱便，走到那里不致疾趨而過了。</p>
<p>這究竟是怎樣做起呢？其實也很自然而簡單。原來那里從自警團制度成立以來，在弄口設着一個崗位，幾天位比較年輕的服務者受不住那股臭氣的薰蒸，而且看上去實然太不雅觀，便在一個下午下了從「小」處做起的決心，實地苦幹了一番。</p>
<p>她們挑了幾桶淸水，備了兩把竹帚，拼命地做着冲掃洗掃工作，那些依牆附璧的黃色陳年老膏，在這幾個年富力强者的努力之下，竟無法抵抗而逐漸消滅了。</p>
<p>如果做了這第一步的仲洗工作，而不去實地監察，那來這苦工還是等於白做。他們一方面在牆上貼着警告，禁止路人不得再在那里方便，一方面實行就近監視，叫人家無從下手，這樣一連三天，來來往往的人，雖眞有內急不堪者，亦只得望望然而去之，另覓正當的地方去解決。到現在差不多已有十餘天約工夫，在不斷的零星冲洗，和嚴密的看管之下，這一個角落也許從此得到解決，而不再是藏垢納污之所了</p>
<p>如果大家能下決心，從小處做起，一個角落薦推廣至於百…千…萬…角落，那末牆壁上「君子自重」等字樣，担保可以永別了!</p>
<h3>兄弟鬩於牆</h3>
<p>— 金毅</p>
<p>兄弟之親，親如手足；即使為了祖上遺產分配不均，而涉訟公庭，也不過是幾個錢的問題，將來各立鬥戶，有什麼婚喪喜慶，還不是「頭頂一姓」，融融如也？</p>
<p>然而在舍弟謀害哥哥的案子發生後，又接踵而起家兄射擊弟弟的新聞。欲置對方於死地而後快，總應該有不世之怨仇在；但前者，祇是老兄不肯慷慨解囊；後者，竟是為了出租一間臥房。共間有沒有「不可告人」的秘密與否，我們不知道，也無從知道；可是也想不出一個為什麼一定要殺死一個人——親如手足的弟兄的理由來。</p>
<p>所謂「兄弟　於牆」，是在牆內吵吵鬧鬧而已，現在是「我要你的命」了！</p>
<h3>活</h3>
<p>— 秦仁</p>
<p>有人說：閉起眼睛罷！</p>
<p>有人說：多活一天，倒底多看一樣！</p>
<p>前者是消極，後者是氣憤，。</p>
<p>然而後者還有活下去的勇氣。</p>
<p>既有勇氣活下去，</p>
<p>更不如堅定地說我要活！</p>

<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（二）悲與喜</p>
<p>等到厲又榭去看了術雲記的壽器回來；看見大門上方，釘了橫披樣的一幅麻，麻上貼了白般剪成的蓮花。他又見天井裹站着七長八短的人，有道士，有樂工，有臨時雇來充雜役的人。他把手按一按，問：「阿興呢？」囑阿興應道：「舅老爺，我在這裏。」厲又榭道：「你去請二太太出來，我在雙梅書屋；看大姑奶奶在，你也請她出來，可不要給你少爺知道，也不要給旁人知道。」阿興道：「有幾個女親來了，二太太在陪着她們哭。」厲又榭把臉一綳道：「為她在哭，你就不能說話嗎？」阿興這才沒有話說。厲又榭先自走到雙梅書屋裏，隨手把門關上，對葉慶棠的遺像長嘆了一聲。他回頤，對明瓦窗上安的小破璃方框望芳，潰葉二太太和大姑奶奶在走來，忙開開門招招手；護她們倆進來了，又關上門，說：「有一件重要的事，和你們談一談。你們一位是維城的嬸娘，一位是維城的姑母，我忝為維城的舅舅，我們三個人先同意了，再給維城知道。」</p>
<p>葉二太太和大姑奶奶都茫然，猜不出厲又榭要說些什磨話，只聽他又說道：「壽器是去看了，還將就可以用得。倒是衛雲卿家裏遇到一個人，這人喚秦潤之，人家有時喚他做九三先生，他說他九流三教無所不知的意思。咋竇維城回來，在路上遇到他，他也和維城招呼。他勸我把喪事慢慢的辦，先辦喜事。」葉二太太和大姑奶奶越發茫然，問怎麼是先辦喜事。厲又榭道：「他也有他的理由，說我姊姊去世了，家裏只　了二嫂子和維城；假使維城再小去念書，只　二嫂子一個人，這是夠冷靜的了。不如把喪不暫時擱下來，擱到後天辦，明天先給維城娶媳婦，是草草不恭的娶媳婦。娶了來，第一是哭婆婆的人有了；發起訃聞來，徹可以頂留一個齊期孫的名字，計聞也好看了。他還說道是通權達變的辦汰，一個人太會得餓經背道，固然是不好；太不會通權達變，也不見得便是好。衛雲卿聽了，也拍手贊成。所鍛我跑回來，和你們商量。」（三七）</p>

<h3>Large-Scale Air Battle Occurs Over New Guinea; Japanese Planes Bomb Port Moresby Again; Military Conference Held in Melbourne</h3>
<p>Washington, 29th (Havas News Agency) - According to news from the Australian radio station in Melbourne, received in San Francisco, a large-scale air battle occurred over the island of New Guinea. Detailed information is not yet available, but it is known that the Japanese Air Force engaged in an air battle with local aircraft groups yesterday while bombing Port Moresby. This was the 21st air raid on the port by Japanese planes. Local newspapers are commenting on the matter, saying that the recent three bombings of the port by Japanese planes were not as intense as before, presumably because the Japanese are trying to disperse enemy air power, forcing the US and Australian air forces to vacate planes to protect airfields in New Guinea. In addition, it is reported that Allied Commander-in-Chief General Macarthur plans to stay in Canberra for a few days before going to headquarters to take office.</p>
<p>Melbourne, 30th (Reuters) - Allied authorities held a military conference here yesterday. Southwest Pacific Commander-in-Chief General Macarthur met Australian Army Commander-in-Chief General Blamey for the first time at the meeting.

After the meeting, changes will be made to Australian military generals and formations.</p>
<p>Flooding in Port Moresby</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 30th (Haitong News Agency) - American hero worship of Macarthur is growing. The "New York Daily News" has discussed this extensively, even suggesting that if Macarthur can lead the United States to victory, he may be elected President of the United States, because the traditional spirit of American presidents, from Washington, Jackson, and Taylor to Theodore Roosevelt, has been victorious generals. However, one difficulty is that the war may not be over by the next election in 1944. If the war is over by then, the American people will definitely give Macarthur an opportunity to enter politics.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Completely Occupy Andaman Islands</h3>

<h3>Situation in Iran</h3>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Havas News Agency) - Iran was originally divided by Britain and the Soviet Union, but in reality, it has become a Soviet experiment. Lately, the Soviet Union, regardless of whether Britain will raise objections in the future, is making incremental progress and making every effort to Sovietize Iran. In the past twelve days, the Iranian capital has been under the control of the Soviet Union, and people are panicked and living in terror. The authorities are currently taking various self-defense measures. Although the Soviet News Agency and American visitors have issued news stating that the situation in Iran is "absolutely normal," in reality, it has reached a state of terror. Therefore, how the Iranian people will react is a matter of great concern. If the Iranian people unite and wash away the shame caused by the treasonous government, Iran will surely be able to restore its importance in the Middle East.</p>
<h3>Vichy Impressed by Attack on Saint-Nazaire</h3>
<p>Vichy, 29th (Havas News Agency) - The British attack on the French port of Saint-Nazaire two days ago has caused a deep impression here. This port is the newest naval base in Europe and even the world, located at the mouth of the Loire River. The world-famous dry dock is located there, and there are all kinds of wharf facilities nearby. There are two dry docks in total, one in the port and one in the Penhoët port. The world's largest mail ship, the "Normandie," was built in the Penhoët shipyard. The main purpose of this British raid was obviously to destroy the dry dock of Saint-Nazaire, which was completed in 1932 and is 350 feet long. Both the left and right ends have sluice gates that can be closed, with the sluice gate on the right being the largest and the main entrance to the port. As for the fact that several British troops were able to carry out a landing and were repelled by German troops only after invading the city, this was due to the fact that the city and the port were too close together. Since last winter, the British have attempted to land in Europe for the _ time, but this is the first time that the US military has achieved considerable results. According to reports, the British first attempted to directly attack the Lofoten Islands in northern Norway last year, and then attempted to land on the coast of Normandy in France, but both times were unsuccessful. The British troops participating in the Saint-Nazaire landing totaled three or four hundred men, one hundred of whom have been captured by German troops. As for the details of the naval battle that took place between the British and German light warships at the mouth of the Loire River, they are not known. What is known is that the water at the mouth of the Loire River is not deep, and even small warships cannot move quickly.</p>
<p>Berlin, 30th (Haitong News Agency) - According to military visitor Blazes, British planes circled _ empty every night, and British ships approached Saint-Nazaire early in the morning the day before yesterday. The British fleet included several motorboats and a destroyer. Scottish troops landed by kayak and occupied several docks, but were discovered by German searchlights. The British ship was hit and caught fire, and the destroyer attempted to escape but was sunk. Although the British troops resisted stubbornly, they were forced to retreat into the harbor city, and street fighting broke out. German troops cleared the landing British troops before noon.</p>
<p>London, 29th (Havas News Agency) - Part of the British troops who attacked the French port of Saint-Nazaire returned to a port in this country tonight. Most of them were seriously injured, and several ambulances were waiting to pick them up at the dock.</p>
<h3>US Transfers Part of Gold to South American Countries</h3>
<p>Washington, 29th (Havas News Agency) - The Treasury Department recently issued a message stating that the US government has transferred part of its gold reserves to various republics in South America. At the end of February this year, the total cash reserves of the United States amounted to $22.74 billion, a decrease of approximately $80 million compared to before the United States entered the war. As of the end of November last year, the United States had a total of $22.784 billion in gold, which was the highest record in the last eight years. According to local financial figures, the decrease in gold is mainly due to the foreign trade surplus of Latin American countries. In addition, the fact that some countries have converted their reserves into cash reserves is also one of the reasons for the outflow of American gold.</p>

<h3>Cripps Formally Announces Outline of British Proposals for India; Constitutional Government to be Established After the War, Creating a Federation with Complete Equality with All Dominions</h3>
<p>New Delhi, 30th (Reuters) - British envoy Sir Stafford Cripps announced last night the British government's proposals regarding the Indian problem. The outline stipulates that after the current war ends, the Indian Constituent Assembly will draft a constitution to establish the Indian Federation, obtain dominion status, and be under the jurisdiction of the British King like other dominions of the British Empire. However, they will be completely equal to other dominions in terms of internal and external affairs. After this constitution is drafted, the government will naturally immediately recognize it. However, the Indian provinces that do not wish to accept this new constitution and wish to maintain their current constitutional system will not be subject to it. In addition, the British government and the Indian Constitutional Drafting Assembly will sign a treaty to protect the racial and religious status of various ethnic minorities within India. The Constitutional Drafting Assembly will be elected by the entire members of the lower house of the provincial assemblies after the re-election of the provincial assemblies after the war, using a proportional election law. The Indian states will appoint representatives to participate in the same proportion according to their population.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 29th (Reuters) - British envoy Sir Stafford Cripps met with reporters in New Delhi tonight and issued a statement on Britain's proposals for resolving the Indian problem. The full text is as follows: When I now announce the conclusions of the British War Cabinet's decision, I wish to explain to you the form of this document. This document has the form of a declaration issued by the Imperial Government on the future of India and the Indian government and Indian defense. I am only publishing this to you today. This proposal has been submitted to the Indian leaders by the War Cabinet, and the Imperial Government's declaration must be published today, but it is the declaration that the Imperial Government is prepared to issue. That declaration will be issued as soon as it receives universal and good acceptance from all sectors of India. I want you to understand this. I believe that every newspaper in India and around the world can study this document with the utmost seriousness and its due sense of responsibility.

I believe that when you express your opinions on this, you will fully understand its significance and importance, and you will fully realize that the way you publish this document and the comments you add to it make you take a _ important position among those who directly participate in solving the problem. I now wish you to give wide publicity to the above document. _ I trust you on one point, that no matter what opinions you express, you will promote the unity of Indian opinions, rather than divide them. I am scheduled to deliver a broadcast speech to the Indians tomorrow night. _ Because of the reason, I _ will not answer the inquiries you raise, except for those who raise them because they _ do not understand the original meaning of the document.</p>

<h3>Cripps Says Difficult for Indians to Preside Over Indian Defense</h3>
<p>New Delhi, 29th (Havas News Agency) - Sir Stafford Cripps recently hosted a press conference here to explain Britain's policy towards India, stating briefly that the British War Cabinet recently decided to establish the Indian Federation, so that it would become a dominion of Britain together with other autonomous territories. It will be implemented immediately after the current war ends, and in the future, India will be free to choose whether to be a British dominion forever or withdraw from the British Empire. However, it is difficult for _ people to preside over the defense of India, and even if all parties make this request, it is impossible to change. In short, the plan drawn up by the British War Cabinet can only be accepted in full or rejected, and there is absolutely no room for compromise. The future Indian Federation will have a central parliament, and all states must elect representatives to participate based on the size of their population. The candidates for representatives will be elected by the provincial legislatures. It is understood that the purpose of the British plan is to establish the Indian Federation and, after jointly pledging allegiance to the British King with other autonomous territories, they can immediately be granted equal status with other autonomous territories and no longer be subject to _ in internal and foreign affairs. _ Once the war is over, the British government will recognize the new Indian constitution based on the above principles. However, Indian provinces that do not wish to accept it can still retain their current status, and the provinces can conclude treaties with the central parliament to protect the rights of ethnic and religious minorities. However, for the time being, the British government sincerely hopes that the Indians will immediately participate in the war to defend their homeland and the British Empire. Cripps _ has expressed that the above plan is the best solution for the happiness and freedom of 350 million Indians.</p>
<p>London, 30th (Reuters) - The British House of Commons is in recess for the Easter holidays, so members of parliament scattered around are quietly awaiting India's reaction to the British cabinet's proposals. The British proposals were originally unanimously approved by the Prime Minister and members of the War Cabinet, so if the Indian side can accept them, there should be no opposition from the parliament.</p>

<h3>Increase in Corpses on the Streets; Urgent Plea for Prompt Collection; Prolonged Exposure is Detrimental to Public Health</h3>
<p>In recent days, due to the uneven weather, there has been a sudden increase in the number of impoverished people residing in the alleys or along the roadsides, who cannot bear the combined effects of poverty and illness, hunger, and drug addicts who succumb to disease. Furthermore, the charitable organizations, relying solely on manpower to collect these corpses found on the streets, are slow in their work. Consequently, corpses in remote roadside locations have remained uncollected for as long as two or three days, exposed to sun and rain, inevitably decaying and emitting foul odors. This not only concerns hygiene but also encourages unscrupulous and base individuals to seize the opportunity to strip the corpses of their clothing for sale. Some corpses have even been found completely naked, a ghastly sight to behold. It is earnestly hoped that the health and police authorities will pay attention to this matter, upholding humanitarian principles and public health.</p>
<h3>Prior License Required for Transporting Various Mineral Oils</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) recently issued a notice stating that Notice No. 5786, issued by the council on February 14 regarding restrictions on the transportation of mineral oils, is revoked. At the same time, it is stipulated that from April 1, the transportation of various mineral oils, such as gasoline, kerosene, fuel oil, machine oil, crude oil, light oil, dithiocarbonate liquid, isooctane, and lubricating grease, must first obtain a permit from the Asia Development Board in the Hamilton House, and then apply for a permit from Office No. 29 on the ground floor of the SMC before it can be carried out. These permits will only be issued based on the primary use.</p>
<h3>Over Two Hundred Orphans Relocated for Care</h3>
<p>Aftermath of the Elderly, Weak, and Disabled Still Under Discussion</p>
<p>Following the dispersal of the Dunxin Road Refugee Camp, more than 600 refugees remained. Their repatriation expenses have been subsidized, and it is hoped that a portion can be repatriated within days. For the remaining few refugees who cannot be repatriated, the aftermath is currently being discussed with the SMC. Their sustenance is temporarily maintained by the Refugee Association. Two hundred orphans from the Beizhejiang Road Fosterage Home have been taken in by the Shanghai Orphanage. Their sustenance is provided by organizations such as the Jisheng Society. Most of the child refugees with families have been claimed. The remaining disabled refugees from various locations will be gathered in one place. The aftermath arrangements are also being discussed with the SMC, and a solution should be finalized within days.</p>

<h3>Notices from Both Concessions: Ban on Exporting Candles</h3>
<p>The SMC recently issued a notice stating that, from March 31, the export of candles from the International Settlement is prohibited (except for those transported to the French Concession). The French Concession authorities also announced that, starting from Tuesday, March 31 of this year, all candles (except those transported to the International Settlement) are not allowed to be exported from the French Concession.</p>
<h3>Vegetable Cultivation Methods - Youth Association Agricultural Lecture - Lecture by Sheng Chengshi</h3>
<p>Vegetables are essential foods for human life, and their importance is second only to food grains. There are those who can maintain their health with an exclusively vegetarian diet, but none can achieve rich nutrition with an exclusively carnivorous diet. This shows that the various nutrients contained in vegetables, such as vitamins A, B, C, and iron and calcium, are not necessarily all found in meat. You can compare the health of vegetarians and meat-eaters to prove my point. At a time when meat is expensive, the need for vegetables is even more pressing. Now that we recognize the importance of vegetables, we should study vegetable cultivation methods to increase their production. This is undoubtedly a secondary solution to the problem of food for the people. In the suburbs of the city, for example, a family of five with three mu of thin land cannot possibly sustain their livelihood by planting rice or cotton. However, by cultivating a vegetable garden, they can harvest three to five crops a year. If managed properly, they can certainly sustain their lives with a surplus.</p>
<p>Types of Vegetables: Melon and Fruit Vegetables - Cucumbers, tomatoes, winter melons, loofahs, eggplants, etc.; Pod Vegetables - Broad beans, peas, soybeans, etc.; Root Vegetables - Radishes, sweet potatoes, beets, etc.; Underground Stem Vegetables - Potatoes, etc.; Leaf Vegetables - Spinach, greens, cabbage, etc.; Flower and Fruit Vegetables - Cauliflower; Stem Vegetables - Chives, onions, garlic, etc.; Tender Stem Vegetables - Asparagus; Miscellaneous - Strawberries, mushrooms, etc.</p>
<p>Types of Vegetable Gardens: Home Vegetable Garden; Small-scale Vegetable Garden; Large-scale Vegetable Garden; Processing-Specific Vegetable Garden (i.e., the attached vegetable garden of a canning factory); Forcing Vegetable Garden (with heating and other equipment to make vegetables mature early).</p>
<h3>Special Security Measures in the International Settlement Completely Lifted; Strict Inspection of Pedestrians and Vehicles on Previous Two Days; All Bridges Over Suzhou Creek Required to Pass in Line</h3>
<p>The International Settlement implemented special security measures for three days starting on the 28th. During this period, in addition to imposing temporary martial law in some areas and intensifying the search of pedestrians, no obstacles were seen set up at the intersection with the French Concession, and vehicles and pedestrians moved freely. However, the inspection of pedestrians on the bridges over Suzhou Creek was very strict, especially for those traveling from south to north. In addition to tram passengers disembarking as usual and walking across the bridge, pedestrians had to line up and cross the bridge one by one. According to a Datong News Agency reporter who patrolled the bridges yesterday afternoon, a winding line of people crossing the bridge was found at the southern end of the Tianhou Temple Bridge, extending westward to Beijing Road, resembling a funeral procession. This phenomenon was not observed at other bridges. On the previous two days, Japanese naval landing forces also deployed posts at important intersections in the central district from time to time, searching passing pedestrians and vehicles. However, traffic was not cut off. According to reporters, temporary martial law was implemented successively in the Sichuan Road, Fuzhou Road, and Beijing Road areas. In addition to dispatching more detectives to patrol and guard their respective jurisdictions, the Shanghai Municipal Police (SMP) also assigned Chinese and Western police officers to station at each tram stop, searching passengers getting on and off the tram to prevent undesirable elements from mixing in. As for the Baojia Self-Defense Corps of the International Settlement, the Baojia organization authorities also issued a notice to each Bao and Jia to dispatch more Self-Defense Corps members to stand guard on the previous two days. It is said that the total number of Self-Defense Corps members on duty was about two thousand. From today, these special security measures have been completely lifted, and traffic in all areas will return to normal. The number of Self-Defense Corps members on duty will also be reduced to the original number.</p>
<h3>Chinese Moral Education Association: Relief for the Poor and Sick; Establishment of Ambulance</h3>
<p>The Chinese Moral Education Association on Tongfu Road recently noted that the soaring prices have greatly affected the livelihoods of the poor. The association has always been proactive in carrying out relief work, and the porridge distribution has not yet ended. Recently, an ambulance for relieving hunger and treating the sick has been added, and it will soon operate in the concession area. When poor and sick people groaning in the streets and alleys are found, they will be treated with medical diagnosis, food and medicine. The association's enthusiasm for charity is truly commendable. This measure not only greatly benefits the poor and sick, but also greatly contributes to local peace and tranquility.</p>
<h3>Summer Property Tax Receipts Should Be Properly Preserved</h3>
<p>The SMC recently issued Notice No. 5837 stating that the property tax receipts for the quarter ending June 30 of this year should be properly preserved by the taxpayers so that they can be presented when needed; otherwise, there may be inconveniences. This matter is of great importance, and all taxpayers must pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>SMC Organizes Registration of Vacant Warehouses</h3>
<p>The SMC recently issued a notice stating that owners of vacant warehouses in the International Settlement should submit a written report of their nationality, as well as the address and volume of the vacant warehouse building, to Office No. 150 of the SMC General Office at 209 Jiangxi Road. The deadline for reporting is April 1.</p>
<h3>Number of Applications for SMC-Issued Return-to-Hometown Certificates Increases Daily</h3>
<p>The SMC's Pass Issuance Office and its branches have been issuing return-to-hometown certificates rapidly, averaging about 3,000 certificates per day. The SMC has recently discovered that some people are profiting by applying for return-to-hometown certificates and half-price certificates on behalf of others, so it has instructed all Pass Issuance Offices to pay close attention. The office hopes that those returning to their hometowns who need a half-price certificate should apply in person to prevent abuses. Various Shanghai native-place associations have been organizing group return-to-hometown registrations for several days. If the applicants are extremely poor and the number reaches 200 or more, they can be referred to the authorities to issue free certificates.</p>
<h3>Tide Level of Huangpu River Will Gradually Rise Starting Next Month; Dredging Work in Various Sections of Huangpu River Still in Progress</h3>
<p>The tides of the Huangpu River will gradually rise starting next month, as the spring tide low tide period has already passed. Generally, it will reach its peak during the autumn tide. As for the seawater outside the Wusong Estuary, there will likely be no large-scale intrusion in the winter, spring, and summer seasons, so there will be no cases of the Huangpu River water becoming salty. Since last winter, the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau has been using the Hong Kong dredger, along with its existing dredgers, to dredge various wharves along the Huangpu River, and the results have been excellent. This has significantly benefited the flow of the Huangpu River water and the navigation of ships.</p>

<h3>In the Case of the Robbery of 320,000 Yuan, the Police Have Captured Several Criminals; The Mastermind, "Little Dog," Is Still at Large</h3>
<p>On the morning of January 16 of this year, the four Shanghai banks of Tianbao, Datong, Jinfeng, and Baocheng, located at No. 5, Lane 444, Jiujiang Road, sent their employees to Shanghai from Nanjing with 220,000 yuan in cash for trading. When they passed the intersection of North Henan Road and Haining Road, they were suddenly attacked and robbed of all the money by several armed robbers. The police officers who arrived on the scene shot and killed one of the robbers, "Little Eight," and seized a Mauser pistol. It is now learned that the case has been solved by the International Settlement police. The wife of the deceased robber, "Little Eight," was arrested first. Based on her confession, more than 16 accomplices were subsequently apprehended, and a portion of the stolen money was recovered. As for the leader of the gang of robbers, known as "Little Dog," he is said to have fled far away with a large sum of the stolen money. In addition to interrogating the arrested criminals and scheduling a sentencing hearing on April 1, the police are also rigorously pursuing the mastermind, "Little Dog," to bring him to justice.</p>
<h3>Returning from Gambling, Encountering Robbery in Broad Daylight</h3>
<p>At about 11:00 yesterday morning, a male pedestrian on the Xinqiao Street Iron Gate in the French Concession was returning from gambling in a gambling den in the Nanshi area, carrying several hundred yuan in cash. Unexpectedly, he was targeted by petty thieves. When the man was followed to the intersection of Avenue Edward VII, two robbers stepped forward to block him, showed a sharp blade, and forbade him from making any noise. They robbed him of all his cash, more than 400 yuan, and fled.</p>
<h3>Second Landlord Sublease Licenses to Be Issued Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Since the application forms for SMC sublease licenses were issued at the Revenue Section, Room 506, SMC Building, Jiangxi Road, second landlords have been flocking to collect them in recent days. After filling them out according to the required format, they can apply for a sublease license at the various branch offices announced by the SMC. When submitting the application form, a license fee of three months, totaling 9 yuan in national currency, and a license plate fee of 1 yuan, totaling 10 yuan, must be paid. The above sublease licenses can be issued starting tomorrow. However, even if one is a second landlord, if one is not currently subletting the remaining rooms to third-party tenants, then it is not necessary to obtain a license.</p>

Those who are not very clear about Chinese stocks can also be provided with explanations and guidance. The service is very thorough.</p>
<h3>Excellent Carbon Paper Introduced to the Market</h3>
<p>Hui Zichu and Zou Zigang, the founders of the Koda Industrial Society, noted that the demand for carbon paper is increasing daily, while the market prices of imported products are surprisingly high. Therefore, based on their research findings, they independently established a manufacturing plant at No. 7 Qingsheng Lane, Qipu Road, specializing in the production of Hero brand carbon paper. The products are excellent, and since their introduction to the market, wholesale orders have been pouring in, and they have been almost unable to keep up with the demand. The recovery of rights and interests is truly significant.</p>

<h3>Striving for a Living: Lin Jim, the Shoe Shiner</h3>
<p>— Ye Fei</p>
<p>More than ten years ago, a love affair between Wu Airong, a female student in Shanghai, and Lin Jim, a deaf-mute youth, was widely publicized in the newspapers as a touching story, and the fact that the lovers eventually married was particularly exciting. However, within a few years, the divorce storm between Lin and Wu shocked society again. Although Attorney Wu Chengyu and relatives mediated, the broken mirror was mended, but the feelings between the deaf-mute couple gradually cooled, and the passion of their love days when they pledged to grow old together was no longer there.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, when I was walking through the Great World, I suddenly saw two deaf-mutes gesturing among the long line of shoe shiners. I originally understood some of the sign language of deaf-mutes, so I could not help but be curious, so I stopped and stared at them. Perhaps they noticed that I was watching them, one of them stopped their hand talk and greeted me, meaning to ask if I wanted my shoes shined. On that Western-looking face of his, I vaguely remembered seeing this person somewhere before. A thread of memory suddenly wrapped around my mind, and I abruptly wrote a few words on his palm to ask him:</p>
<p>"Are you Lin Jim, the deaf-mute lover?"</p>
<p>The deaf-mute friend across from him rushed to nod and answer for him. Looking at Lin Jim, a rather unnatural look was revealed on his smiling face. In order to learn a little about the current situation of the deaf-mute lover and the reason for becoming a shoe shiner, I obtained Lin Jim's consent, sat on the canvas stool used for customers, and began our half-gesture, half-written conversation.</p>
<p>"Are your feelings good now?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Still good." He smiled and nodded to me, but after a while, his handsome face was completely shrouded in a cloud of sorrow. Slightly wrinkling his brow, he began to write down everything: (To be continued)</p>

<p>Business News</p>
<h3>Shuangma Mill Forward Contracts Show Particularly Strong Upward Momentum</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market started with a rise followed by stability, but the upward momentum of Shuangma Mill forward contracts was particularly strong. This is because there are rumors in the market that there is hope of taking physical delivery. As for Shuangma spot goods, affected by registration, there are more selling settlements and loosening, but major players are calm and unmoved, and even buying at low prices, because inventory is decreasing daily. The opening price of 20-count Shuangma Mill forward contracts was 3,300 yuan, which rose to 3,410 yuan shortly after. Sellers released, and there was a decline, but the buying was very strong, and the price continued to rise to 3,490 yuan at the close. 42-count Lanfeng was 8,250 yuan, falling to 8,050 yuan, closing at 8,230 yuan. 42-count Lima was 8,140 yuan, 40-count Jincheng was 7,650 yuan, 42-count Yanghe was 8,200 yuan, 20-count Yueqin was 4,050 yuan to 4,100 yuan, 20-count Shuangma was 4,000 yuan to 3,820 yuan, closing at 3,880 yuan, 20-count Tiannv was 3,880 yuan, 20-count Jinji was 4,080 yuan, 60-count Niutou was 16,900 yuan, 32-count Honghong was 6,700 yuan, 10-count Hongshuangma was 2,550 yuan to 2,650 yuan.</p>
<h3>No Need to Register Mill and Warehouse Receipts; Cotton Cloth Prices Show Stronger Rise</h3>
<p>The factory cloth market yesterday initially fell and then rose, with the price increasing more sharply in the afternoon. Transactions were lively. There were also huge transactions in Yihua Mill and Tongyi Mill coarse cloth factory receipts. White cloth prices rose by 2.5 to 10 yuan, and bleached and dyed cloth prices rose by about 5 yuan. Huadie coarse cloth spot goods were 200 yuan to 205 yuan, factory receipts were 103 yuan to 112 yuan, Fugui fine cloth was 168 yuan to 171 yuan, Feihong coarse cloth was 167 yuan to 172 yuan, 11-pound coarse cloth was 130 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong was about 90 yuan, and Chuji Shilin was 255 yuan to 260 yuan. More than 600 pieces were transacted on this street.</p>
<p>Because there is no need to register factory and warehouse receipts for East cloth, the appetite of both insiders and outsiders has become stronger again, and the buying interest has suddenly become strong. The prices of various cloths have risen in a straight line. The opening price of the new Longtou fine cloth was 204 yuan in the morning, rising to 208 yuan at the close. It opened at 212 yuan in the afternoon, rising steadily, with a maximum of 222 yuan, closing at 212 yuan in the evening. Old warehouse receipts were 198 yuan, Feiyu Caiqiu was 200 yuan, Laba was 198 yuan, Wufu was 196 yuan, Baobei fine twill was 165 yuan, Xieyu twill was 170 yuan, and the factory receipts for the Four Gentlemen Serge for October to December were 6.8 yuan. The new red tax was 6.6 yuan.</p>
<h3>Public Bonds Advance Steadily</h3>
<p>Yesterday's off-exchange trading of public bonds was quite stable in terms of popularity. Most transactions involved buying strong and selling weak positions, leading to a gradual increase in market prices. This was due to a large number of short covering trades, giving buyers a stronger position. Some sellers, after having sold, realized the upward trend and bought back in to cover their positions. Although the news was generally dull, there were no negative reports, which encouraged buyers. For example, Hongxing and Lianhe firms each entered orders for over ten thousand, while Yongkang and Runde also entered orders for around ten thousand each. Shuntai Dafeng covered short positions, and Tongli entered large buy orders. Tongkang sold over ten thousand of Class C and E bonds, while Dingkang, Dazhong, and Tongyuan all released bonds. Tongyi, Yuxing, and Hefeng all initially sold and then bought back in. As a result, the market price stabilized and continued to rise by five cents, one dime, to three dimes. The total transaction volume was approximately 500,000 yuan. A simplified table is provided below:</p>
<p>Foreign stocks remained stable and strong, with 15,300 shares traded. The Jiahe Yarn Factory was particularly active, accounting for 8,200 shares. The price initially retreated from 26.75 yuan to 26.5 yuan, but ultimately reached 27 yuan. 1,500 shares of Xinhe were traded at 7.5 yuan. 3,500 shares of Yeguang retreated from 18 yuan to 18.2 yuan. 600 shares of British United were traded at 20.05 yuan and 20.075 yuan. Jardine Matheson was traded at 54.5 yuan, electric tramway at 42 yuan, and Xiangtai Timber at 23.5 yuan, each with 100 shares traded. 1,000 shares of Galandans were traded at 8.7 cents, and 200 shares of Langezhi at 14.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Chinese stocks remained flat and weak. China and France (new) were at 48.5 yuan, New Asia (new) at 30.05 yuan, Shenghua Preferred at 16 yuan, Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company at 54 yuan, Wing On Company at 65 yuan (ex-dividend 45.5 yuan), down slightly by two yuan, Sincere at 77.5 yuan, China Underwear (new) at around 18.5 yuan, and Great China Match at 122.5 yuan. Huashang Automobiles were at 17.75 yuan. Trading was sparse.</p>
<h3>Cash and Military Notes Move in Lockstep</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the black market for cash was fiercely competitive. Since the registration of cash, the industry has been uncertain about future developments, leading to a wait-and-see attitude. Some small long positions were released, resulting in thin trading volume. Prices initially rose and then fell. After 18,000 yuan was broken, prices retreated. Initially, there was little supply to meet demand, causing buyers to drive up the price. The market opened at 18,500 yuan per bar (ten taels), soaring by 1,150 yuan. Subsequently, a certain gold firm and individual investors released cash, immediately causing the price to retreat to between 17,700 and 17,800 yuan, where it lingered for a long time. A certain jewelry store and money exchange absorbed the supply. Later, securities firms sold cash, causing a further drop of 200 to 300 yuan, reaching a low of 17,450 yuan. Trading became even more sparse, and the market closed at 11:00 AM at 17,500 yuan, which was 150 yuan higher than the closing price on Saturday afternoon. The daily range was 1,050 yuan. After the close, it was heard that military notes had risen, and the price also rose to between 17,600 and 17,700 yuan, and in the afternoon, rose to between 18,200 and 18,300 yuan.</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry per tael at jewelry stores. Daxin and its counterparts initially raised prices by 100 yuan to 1,950 yuan, and then lowered them back to 1,900 yuan (purchase price reduced by 200 yuan), an increase of 50 yuan. Fine silver was listed at 20 yuan, and the black market price was around 13.5 yuan. A silver coin was 8.5 yuan, it was said.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw stable British pounds and U.S. dollars. The former remained at 400 yuan, and the latter remained at 410 yuan. U.S. dollar drafts remained at 25-26 yuan, and Hong Kong drafts also remained at 3.5 yuan, with large notes reduced by one dime. Military notes opened in the morning at 7.25 yuan, and suddenly soared to 7.75 yuan at noon, finally closing at 7.55 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association was nine percent, unchanged. The discount rate for bills of exchange rose by five yuan to ten yuan per thousand yuan, it was said.</p>
<h3>Daily Necessities are Very Weak</h3>
<p>The daily necessities market was flat and weak in buying interest. Unfavorable rumors for buyers caused public sentiment to be extremely weak. Some holders of goods took profits and sold, and sales were difficult to boost. Most traders sold more than they bought, so prices gradually fell. Calculated doing business, Guben soap was 350 yuan, Huang Xiangmao soap was 295 yuan, Bai Xiangmao soap was 310 yuan, Arrow soap was 310 yuan, Beautiful Brand matches were 7,400 yuan, Phoenix Brand was 7,000 yuan, Miscellaneous Brand was 5,700 yuan, Sail Brand candles were hundreds of yuan, Monk Hat Brand was 190 yuan, which were uniformly lower than before.</p>
<h3>Feather Yarn Serge Strong</h3>
<p>Because the restriction of movement of woolen cloth is imminent, the delivery has been very strong recently. In addition, because a general small number of tenants have come out one after another, the standard market conditions on the avenue have turned downstream uniformly, and the rising price of each commodity has stopped. However, the member stores of the general industry association, in view of the fundamental lack of goods at the bottom, generally do not endorse the opening of feather yarn serge. One is because the actual sales are continuing in season, the second is because the market goods are tight, and the third is because the tenants have limited supplies in their hands, so the trend is still firm. Yesterday, the first-class wholesale price of various colored stripes and plain feather yarn serge from the incoming road was 150 yuan per yard, the second-class was 125-6 yuan, the first-class product of this factory was 100 yuan, and the second-class was around 80 yuan.</p>
<h3>Jackfruit</h3>
<p>— Gao Jianong</p>
<p>It is under the crown, those countless red and gorgeous bracts, purple-blue flowers, clustered together to form that fat and dense flower ball. The flowers are monoecious, the stamens are yellow, the ovary is inferior, and there are three chambers. After the pistil is fertilized, the ovary gradually swells, becomes fleshy, and finally all the ovaries are tightly combined together, so that it forms a round or oval fruit like a pine cone, about four or five inches long, initially green, and purple or yellow when ripe. This is the sweet and sour jackfruit with a special flavor that we usually eat. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Starting from Small Things</h3>
<p>— Weimo</p>
<p>"Do not refrain from doing good deeds just because they are small" is a famous saying that teaches people to experience and practice every small thing. If a person can truly do everything, no matter how small, with determination and perseverance, the result will definitely be very good. Recently, I saw a truly "starting from small" thing on the streets and alleys. I might as well record it below to prove that what I said is not wrong.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that in Shanghai, where public toilets have not yet been widely established on the streets, the most annoying and helpless thing in the alleys is that everyone urinates everywhere. Not to mention that the ground is covered in "golden yellow" and "overflowing" odors, causing pedestrians to cover their noses and pass by. Even the walls are covered with various patterns, "calligraphy and paintings" are dazzling, and it is unbearable to look at, fully demonstrating the roots of filth and laziness. Moreover, once someone initiates this behavior, it is followed day and night, with the momentum of wearing through the doorsills (assuming there are any). This cannot be said to be a major stain on the city's appearance.</p>
<p>Recently, in a neighboring alley, a miracle was suddenly discovered. That old latrine from distant years was actually eliminated, and the time spent was not long, only three days. A dark and dirty place restored its original appearance of clean corners. From then on, pedestrians could conveniently walk there without having to hurry past.</p>
<p>How exactly was this done? Actually, it was very natural and simple. Since the establishment of the self-defense corps system, a post was set up at the entrance of the alley. A few young service personnel could not stand the fumigation of the stench, and it looked really unsightly. One afternoon, they made a decision to start from "small" things and worked hard in practice.</p>
<p>They carried a few buckets of clear water, prepared two bamboo brooms, and desperately engaged in flushing and sweeping work. Those yellow, long-standing stains attached to the walls could not resist the efforts of these young and strong individuals and gradually disappeared.</p>
<p>If this first step of rushing and washing work is done without practical supervision, then this hard work is still equivalent to doing it in vain. On the one hand, they posted warnings on the wall, prohibiting passers-by from conveniently going there again. On the other hand, they implemented close monitoring, so that people could not find a way to do it. For three consecutive days, the people coming and going, even those who were really in dire need, had to look away and leave, and find a proper place to solve it. Now it has been about ten days, and under constant sporadic flushing and strict supervision, this corner may be solved from now on, and will no longer be a place to hide dirt and harbor filth.</p>
<p>If everyone can make up their minds and start from small things, one corner will be recommended and extended to hundreds...thousands...millions...of corners, then the words "gentlemen respect themselves" and other similar sayings on the walls will surely be bid farewell to forever!</p>
<h3>Brothers Quarrel Within the Walls</h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>The affection between brothers is as close as hands and feet; even if they are involved in litigation in public court due to unequal distribution of ancestral property, it is nothing more than a matter of a few coins. In the future, when each establishes their own household, what weddings and funerals will still be "under the same surname", harmonious as before?</p>
<p>However, after the case of a younger brother murdering his older brother occurred, news of an older brother shooting his younger brother followed closely. To put the other party to death, there should always be a world of grudges and hatred; but the former was simply because the older brother was unwilling to generously donate money; the latter was actually because of renting out a bedroom. Whether there are "unspeakable" secrets between them or not, we do not know, and we have no way of knowing; but we cannot think of a reason why one must kill a person - a brother as close as hands and feet.</p>
<p>The so-called "brothers quarrel within the walls" is just吵吵闹闹within the walls. Now it's "I want your life"!</p>
<h3>Live</h3>
<p>— Qin Ren</p>
<p>Some say: Close your eyes!</p>
<p>Some say: Living one more day, after all, you see one more thing!</p>
<p>The former is passive, the latter is angry.</p>
<p>However, the latter still has the courage to live.</p>
<p>Since you have the courage to live,</p>
<p>It is better to firmly say that I want to live!</p>
<h3>Scarcity Increases Value</h3>
<p>— Wang Ye</p>
<p>When foreign rice is one斗one圆, choose a store with good rice.</p>
<p>When foreign rice is five升one圆, any rice store will do.</p>
<p>When foreign rice is three升one圆, it is best to line up a little earlier.</p>
<p>When foreign rice is two升one圆, you have to get up in the dark!</p>
<p>When foreign rice is one升one圆, the whole bag is ready to go in the middle of the night!</p>
<p>………………？</p>
<p>Domestic rice is seventy or eighty yuan per 石, "No wonder people are搶米!"</p>
<p>Domestic rice is one hundred and several tens of yuan per 石, "So expensive!"</p>
<p>Domestic rice is two hundred and several tens of yuan per 石, "Really outrageous!"</p>
<p>Domestic rice is three hundred yuan per 石, "Quickly buy a few斗, it will rise again!"</p>
<p>Domestic rice is four hundred yuan per 石, "I have to buy a斗 even if I risk my life!"</p>
<p>Domestic rice is five hundred yuan, six hundred yuan………"I ran around for a long time and couldn't buy any, what should I do!?"</p>
<h3>Sharing a Boat in Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(Two) Sadness and Joy</p>
<p>When Li Youxie went to see the coffin of Shu Yunji; he saw a piece of hemp nailed above the gate, like a horizontal banner, with lotus flowers cut out of white paper pasted on the hemp. He also saw people of all sizes standing in the patio, including Taoist priests, musicians, and temporary hired hands doing odd jobs. He pressed his hand and asked, "Where is A Xing?" He told A Xing to answer, "Uncle, I am here." Li Youxie said, "Go and invite the Second Madam out. I am in the Shuangmei Study; see if the eldest young lady is there, please invite her out too. Don't let your young master know, and don't let anyone else know." A Xing said, "A few female relatives have come, and the Second Madam is accompanying them and crying." Li Youxie glared and said, "You can't speak for her, you can't speak?" A Xing didn't say anything. Li Youxie first walked to the Shuangmei Study, closed the door casually, and sighed at the portrait of Ye Qingtang. He looked back and looked at the small broken glass frame on the skylight. He saw the Second Madam and the Eldest Young Lady were walking over, and hurriedly opened the door and beckoned them to come in. After protecting them both, he closed the door and said, "There is an important matter to discuss with you. One of you is Uncle Wei Cheng's wife, one is Wei Cheng's aunt, and I am Uncle Wei Cheng. The three of us agree first, and then let Wei Cheng know."</p>
<p>The Second Madam and the Eldest Young Lady were both at a loss, unable to guess what Li Youxie was going to say. They only heard him say, "I went to see the coffin, and it's still usable. But I met a person at Wei Yunqing's house. This person is called Qin Runzhi, and people sometimes call him Mr. Ninety-Three, meaning he knows everything about the nine streams and three religions. When I came back with Dou Wei Cheng, I met him on the road, and he greeted Wei Cheng. He advised me to handle the funeral slowly and do the happy event first." The Second Madam and the Eldest Young Lady were even more at a loss, and asked what it meant to do the happy event first. Li Youxie said, "He has his reasons. He said that my sister is dead, and there are only the Second Sister-in-law and Wei Cheng in the family; if Wei Cheng goes away to study, only the Second Sister-in-law will be left alone, which is quiet enough. It is better to put the funeral aside for the time being, put it aside for the day after tomorrow, and marry Wei Cheng a wife tomorrow. Marrying is a casual and disrespectful wedding. After marrying, the first thing is that there will be someone to cry for the mother-in-law; when sending out the obituary, we can add the name of a grandson, and the obituary will look better. He also said that it is a way to be flexible. It is certainly not good for a person to be too stubborn; it is not necessarily good to be too inflexible. Wei Yunqing listened and applauded. So I ran back to discuss with you." (Three Seven)</p>
