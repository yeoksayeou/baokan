<h3>神秘的埃及（六）</h3>
<p>眞正的埃及人是漢族遺存在埃及的後裔，爲數只有八十餘萬，反不及外來的這般閃族人多。他們大都信回敎，信奉基督敎和猶太敎的較少。</p>
<p>在埃及的鄕下田間，到處都是埃及人，他們大都從事耕種，所以有專名曰：Fellah，意即農民也。照法國人種學權威在「東方人種史」中，所描寫的埃及人，眞是活龍活現。他說：「在埃及鄉間只有一種典型人物，刻畫在Thebes和Memphis　寺院和石墓內壁上的人像，正是他們的一個絕好寫照。他們身材瘦長，肩頭寬闊平坦，背部隆起，手臂靈活，指掌機長，腿部贏弱，脚細長而成弓形。頭不長，鵝蛋臉，額略向後傾，眼睛大而有奕彩，鼻高大，嘴闊而脣厚，齒雖小而極爲齊整，二耳聳高緊貼於頭部。」</p>
<p>現在你可以想像得到這種農民的外相了。至於他們的習性，以前一班人都只是應聲相附地說，他們怎麼怎麼好，事實上和實際相去遙遙。這位人種學家倒獨能本科學精神，一字不虛地叙述。他寫道：「農民的樣子苦惱，眼睛裏含着恐懼的光，走起路來似乎心神不安，一雙手顛顛擻擻，好像老在求人家幫忙。他們大都麻木不仁，唯命是從，根本不知道淸紅皂白。」</p>
<p>依近人Piotbey說，他們沒有良知，沒有個性，沒有種族視念，沒有信心，沒有　毀之別，沒有互助精神。這般埃及人眞是一羣可憐虫，他們自從自亞邇人，波斯人等侵入爲主後，一直未曾抬頭。埃及的獨立運動之所以始終不能　印度這般順利，實在大半也是這種民族性的緣故。</p>
<p>壞的反面，他們也有着優秀的性格。他們誠實可靠，　素不車。最司取的，就是他們對於工作的熱誠。由於這個特性，埃及人能使不毛的沙漢有大量的生產，能使不雨之邦成爲世界上一大農立國。</p>
<p>埃及人民中有五分之三以上是農夫。農夫有一種，第一種是隨雇隨歇的農工，每日工薪只有埃幣三個P　iastres，合不到一個法郞。他們家裏的一切開支零用都靠此區區收入。普通一個埃及農夫至少有五六個孩子，你想這種生活怎麼過。所以孩子們往往不及成人便去做工，有半個　Piastre　可拿，以貼補家用。女子們因守舊關係，都不拋頭露面，出來時還要身穿黑衣，頭戴黑紗，臉都遮起來，只有二顆眼珠閃閃可見。他們平時只吃芭米餅，喝點尼羅河的水，嚼嚼蠶豆和碗豆，啃田裏的甘蔗咸，所費不到一個埃幣。菜餚又大都不用烹調，所以節儉得很。這種制度在埃及志部盛行，在三角洲亦有，但工錢比較大。農工們因為埃及氣候溫暖，一年四季都能耕作之故，他們倒不至於沒有工作。今天的工薪，今天用掉，明天還有明天的工作，他們雖然勞苦，即也無憂無慮呢。</p>
<p>典型的埃及農民</p>

<h3>上海福幼院訪問記</h3>
<p>丁福保先生學術深湛，著作宏富，醫學兩界，夙所推崇。近年致力社會事業，主持福幼院，其設施完備，頗多足述，下文所記，僅示先生福幼事業之、斑耳。</p>
<p>「幼吾幼，以及人之幼」，這是人類博愛精神的表現。年來上海慈幼事業有相當的進展，雖然是適應着環境的需要，但是同時也可見社會熱心人士正充分表現着這種博愛精神。上海福幼院，當然是亦這種精神之下產生的一例。</p>
<p>該院的院長就是現在大家替他六十晋　壽辰發起了祝壽把壽儀捐助敎育及社會事業的—福保先生，丁先生一生有許多特點，　善於攝生把年屆古稀的身體，保養得和壯年一樣；　年來替人治病，很少開藥方，却常把食物療病的新法，指導病家，病家都得到很顯著的效果；　把一生所有的精神財力，盡量的貢獻社會；　一生從未破例做過一回壽；因此我想該院在這樣一位超越常人的老先生主持之下，當然也有許多與衆不同的地方。何况該院的副院長激斌先生，是一位基督信徒，本着基督博愛犧牲的精神，在丁先生指導之下，切切實實的來辦慈幼事業，當然是牡丹綠葉，相得益彰。該院在董家渡公義一〇一號，是一座　層樓房，前後共有兩進，前進是七開間，後進是五開問，裏面的大小房間，連廚房在內，不下三四十個。房子是相當的寬大，加以內部　漆得煥然一新，倒一毫不覺得是一所舊式樓房，不過那窗格裏面，完全嵌着蠣殼，在我們看慣亮晶晶玻璃窗的人，好像一旦身入古殿，倒覺古意盎然。據說這所樓房，是一位隱名的業主，完全免費租給該院的，因此我想起小時候看的聊齋誌異首篇考城隍裏面有一副對句，叫做「善欲人知，便非眞善」；這位爲善而不欲人知的業主，眞値得我們萬分欽佩的。</p>
<p>現在院內收容的小朋友，大約有一百五六十名，年齡最大的有十四五歲，最小的四五歲，七八歲的佔着最多數。這些小朋友有些是沒有父母的孤兒，有些是父母無力撫養，把他們送了來，解除一部份的生活負担，還有一二是該院自己收下的街頭難童，聽說這些小朋友在進院的時候，有的渾身疥瘡，有的面黃肌瘦，骨立如柴，簡直沒有一個是身體壯健的。現在呢，這些小朋友雖然不能說都吃喝得肥顯胖耳，却多數是面色紅潤，活潑鮮健，很少有瘠弱的狀態，這大槪因爲該院院長丁福保先生是一位醫界老前輩，又是一位研究食物營養的專家，在他的指導之下，把富含各種維他命的食物，來營養這輩小朋友，所以把他們的體質都改造得這樣好。</p>
<p>這裏有十幾位敎職員，却沒有一個工役，因爲一切雜事，都是由敎職員們幫着年長些的小朋友自已動手來做，非但一方而節省開支，同時還養成了這些小朋友勤勞的習慣，這一點大可給一般兒童敎養院取法的。敎師們對待小朋友，都很和藹可親，敎導他們也很認眞，把人家的子弟當作自巳的一樣吧。</p>
<p>敎學方面，也不是專門敎小朋友讀些死書，是隨時隨地把活的學問，灌輸到小朋友的腦筋裏去，同時又注重手腦並用，使每一個小朋友却得發揮他們的智慧，鍛鍊他們的體魄，在百常生活之中，盡量灌輸給他們做人的應有知識。這種生活敎育，對於小朋友的將來，是很够實用的。</p>
<p>衛生方面，除了採用新的營養方法，來健全這些小朋友的自然發育之外，衣服淸潔整齊，也很注意，此外設有健身房，沐浴間，都很有益於小朋友的健康。在保健方面，新近由慈淑保健會胡起鵬醫師到該院，替每個小朋友檢查身體，發現有肺病嫌疑時，他們是和防癆協會合作的，由會方醫院免費照Ｘ光，小朋友如果生病，院內設有病房，由看護小姐替他調護，重病便送到莫利愛路兒童醫院，由該醫院義務治療，因爲該醫院也是抱着合作精神的。</p>
<p>在該院的後背，還有一個很大的園地，裏面極些玉蜀黍黃豆之類，領導小朋友學習些農事常識。總之該院是一個新闢的兒童樂園，有着特等的園丁，培植那一百五六十個小朋友的新生命，我們要怎樣來使他維持不墮，那當然需要社會上熱心人士的充分加以愛護了</p>

<h3>公債連同息票交割　統甲復出四十元關</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨市漲風愈見有力、甲種復又穿出四十元大關、丙種亦衝達三十九元、形勢頗形優美、交割時仍連同十二十三兩期息票、故行市應連兩期息計算、故市價雖漲、若除息計算、則又反覺其低、照目下環境淸形推論、買賣已可公開、人心已屬安定、前之大賣戶已經中止、即浮戶出範、亦已成強弩之末、其欲出而未出者、已改變其觀念、其已出在中途者、亦改變其途徑、一究各家之出入、即可瞭然、如同利多日陸續均係買進其背景實力可想、如聯益及大中進胃亦極濃厚、如同順向係出範主意、兩日來又吸收不少、順泰吸收爲最近之生力軍、餘尚未計、賣方潤利鴻大信記、餘如同康·新華·胡鶴記·五和·大通等、均爲先出後入、不過出多入少耳、市價結果、續漲六七角至一元三角、成交約近二百萬元、茲列建明表於後、</p>
<p>華股疲落居多</p>
<p>咋華商股票市况、於交易淸稀中、價仍虛疲不振、尤以呆定已一週之文化股、跌勢較銳、商務書館小五元、中華及世界各低二元五角、有脫手求現賣戶、南洋烟草更難振作削落元半、新藥業已轉堅穩、新亞及中法各升五角、民誼獨低元許、百貨業永安微降、新新趨穩、閘北水電復降一元、義商電氣呆定、寗紹輪船有復航在即之訊、價頗堅挺、升至六十元關口、國貨及麗華公司並三友實業社、有新買戶活躍、照當日走勢、巳由疲轉平、且七底已過、銀根轉鬆、明日（週一）各市價格有回升希望、茲分記各股市價表於後、</p>
<p>銀樓飾金原盤　互做價格先低後回</p>
<p>本市銀樓業大新同行首飾金每兩兌出價、均仍掛二千二百五十元未更、（收進减三百五十元）、同行互做價先低後回、晨每兩做一千九百叫十元、計低十元、現金號等買進、始回升、做高至一千九百六十五元、正午一千九百六十元、比上日軋升十元有廿五元差度、成交更稀、首飾紋銀每兩掛十六元未更同業互做價爲十一元四五角</p>
<p>拆息掛小二分</p>
<p>錢業公會拆息突見掛小二分、爲一角八分、新劃頭與現錢仍平掉、外幣市况、日軍票雖有小額某種結款、而同業供售亦殷、做過五元五角五分、後加二厘、始有賣戶、至銀號與錢莊幫門市出入價、仍爲五元五角四分半及五元半亦平云、</p>
<h3>赤日當空冷飲利市（續）</h3>
<p>查夏季的冷飲品部，商店裹大都是臨時設立，如水菓店·茶食店·糖果店·烟紙店·和菜館點心店等，專做夏天一季的生意，其所賣的冷飲品，有自製的，有批來代售的，因其利厚，所以做的不少，商人的做買賣，必須要對準了時令。那才有利可圖。</p>
<p>今年的伏暑裏，因爲西瓜價鈿特別昂貴，不滿十斤一只西瓜，要化十多隻洋，總有的捨不得買來吃。所以較次一般小販，出賣冷飲品的也特別的多，捐了一張照會，就在馬路上挑一副擔子，賣的是「刨冰·和凉粉」，紅綠色的不知道是什麼水，價鈿却也並不最便宜，也得要二三角儲鈔才可以解一霎時的暑渴。還有江北小孩沿街叫喊的販賣機器冰，和不出名的棒冰，生意倒也不差。這種光顧的主客，都是下層階級的人也講不衛生不衛生了</p>
<p>馬路上沿路設攤賣冷飲品，比較稍些好的，用幾塊木板，幾只橙子，攔成一攤子，考究的板上攤一塊白布，陳列着的是玻璃缸裏放置白糖，幾只玻璃杯和刨冰車，這是賣刨冰攤，有的帶賣契稅，自製冰淇淋，橘子水檸檬水也有，價鈿比店裏便宜得多。</p>
<p>總之，在這盛夏烈日之下，勞苦的人們，為了汗的盡量蒸發，水份的需要也特別迫切，最是實胃的普通的馬路上賣碗凉茶吃吃，所費只有一角儲票，或則路上做好事的茶亭裏的茶，是一般慈善店家設立，以供路人口渴時免費贈喝。還的人力車互助會及求世軍三教育會設立的馬路上的茶亭，到處都有，不費分文，而且最合衛生。在這生活程度高壓下，今年叉來幣制改變，商人們的心中今年的物價，比不得去年了，正當的商店物品，當局有統制限價，惟有吃食店裏的物價，利厚利薄，悉由老闆們的良心，所以今年做冷飲品的生意，利潤特別的豐厚。經營的人也特別多，因爲漲價雖漲得驚人，買吃的人却依舊不少。可是這些冷飲攤販，實與衛生上有極大的妨碍，今年霍亂盛行，對於這種不衛生的冷飲，實有禁止發售的必要。（文海）</p>

<h3>布銷未有起色</h3>
<p>昨日棉布、仍頗沉寂、蓋實銷旣稀、人心又虛、龍頭細布新單收盤爲一七八元五角、又銀行單一五三元五角、飛魚細布一五八元五角、陽鶴一五六元、四君子嗶嘰六元九角二分開盤、六元八角七分收盤、廠布交易淸淡、價亦無甚榮辱、十六磅地球粗布一七七元、又飛鴻一七四元、十二磅富貴細布一五九元、有成交、桃花女士林做開二五九元五角、</p>
<h3>棉紗投機　乃告絕迹</h3>
<p>紗市自同業公會取締交易以來、爲愼重起見、加之天氣炎熱、將市塲暫行停頓、審查同業會員資格、並修改規章、須整理淸楚、方能恢復營業、於是投機交易、一網打盡、雙馬廠單之行市完全消滅矣、至於現紗需要較淸澹、市態趨人疲境中、</p>
<h3>大馬口鐵　零銷尙見熱鬧</h3>
<p>五金各貨交易、昨日依然淸淡、就零購與躉交、比較則前者較後者見熱、躉批買賣、益感一無足述、查昨市二十四號與二十六號大馬口鐵、零星張數交易尙稱熱鬧、探悉全日間成交者約三四十張光景、大多係小工塲作之手工川戶、因欲維持生活、不得不搜購原料品、但是項大馬口鐵、滬埠存底已十分單薄、大量現貨巳無從購得、故執有此少量存貨之同業、人心異常俏俐、並不隨其他五金品之實銷難暢、而市勢趨軟、是以此貨標準依舊堅定、如廿四號貨每張沽一百二十元、（該花色交易較稀）、二十六號花色每張售一百元、（該項貨市上成交尙熱但多屬零星甩戶）、探其行價、與前相彷云、</p>

<p>食糖證金暫用儲券　原定章程未更</p>
<p>本月份各種食糖、零售商申請購買期限、業已截止、其購糖證金、合作營業處定章原以軍票爲本位、茲因零售商之請求、暫准以中儲券代用、以示通融、但該處定章、絕未變史云、</p>
<h3>天目尖市象軟</h3>
<p>靑笋干、邇來以到存不多、市勢平定、惟天目尖趨勢見軟、查前市曾到過六七百元、現客方手貨巳不復堅持、時有隨市售出、故較普通之貨、僅售五百元之譜、有一份部客貨欲扳六百元、一時未易達到也、</p>

<p>核桃巳入冷藏者、近有開出、普通爲一百八十二元、較高者二百餘元、上色無成交、桃肉走勢稍動、普通爲五百兀、津桃玉五百六十元、桃球六百元、</p>
<p>香烟評價在即</p>
<p>香烟市面、因各路走銷呆滯、一般囤戶一度騷動、邇父呈寗靜、無意進取、再以當局評價在即、故人心虛怯、而價欲漲乏力、昨做開計大英牌續小至八千一百元、老刀牌五千一百元、品海牌四千三百元、五華牌三千一百五十元、小仙女牌三千六百五十元、較前冉小一二百元之譜、日烟交易尙暢、故市氣堅持、計金槍牌一千四百元、金大樓牌一千八百五十元、紅玫瑰牌一千○五十元、全祿牌一千五百五十元、念枝全祿牌一千五百七十元、指南牌一千三百元、國烟金鼠牌一千五百元、美麗牌二千七百元、金字塔牌三千元、亦告　穩、</p>
<p>日用品上落甚微</p>

<p>家庭</p>
<h3>夫婦的責任</h3>
<p>— 益</p>
<p>許多人以為一對男女在結婚以後，就成為夫婦，而變成家庭中的主角，但他們不久就忘記了他們的責任。</p>
<p>其實，男女雙方的責任和義務，是很淺近的，蕭伯納在「千歲人」劇裏面，說明了他的定義，我們可以從下列的一段對白裏看出來：</p>
<p>亞當：我將永遠愛夏娃，不愛別人。</p>
<p>夏娃：如果亞當能遵守他的諾言，我將除了他以後，不再愛別個人。</p>
<p>蛇：你們兩個人巳發明結婚了，他之對於你而不對別人發生關係他就是你的丈夫，你之對於他而不對別人發生關係，你就是他的妻子？</p>
<p>我願意一般未會結婚和已經結婚的人，時時牢記他們的責任和義務。</p>
<h3>夏天飲品</h3>
<p>— 竺迅</p>
<p>荷棄粥　鮮荷葉菜攤有售，與粥同煮，食時消香可口，功能開胃，佐以茴香，風味更佳。</p>
<p>凉粉　向南貨店內購石花菜，加水放鍋中煮爛，置冷水中凝結一小時後即成，食時伴以薄荷水（藥材店內有售）白糖（田麥粉亦可）淸凉無比。</p>
<p>茶豆湯　茶豆浸水使胖和糯米或芡實米仁煮熟，加白糖少許，冲以薄荷水同食，適口異常。</p>
<p>自製凉茶　向藥材店購藿香，日常泡茶，代替茶葉，待凉飲之凉爽可口，兼可防疫。</p>
<h3>保健運動法　（六）</h3>
<p>麥氏保健法，以第十至十九式爲第二組，已於本期登完，自第二十式起，即巳進人最後一組，即第三組，練習時，如一二組合做而不覺喫力或疲乏，可繼績做第三組，否則應如前幾期所說，寗可循序漸進，而不可性急貪多，或僅揀做比較容易，或是自己認爲有與趣的方式，因爲每一種方式，各有其功用，必須依次練習，纔能得到應有的效果。</p>
<p>按多坐少動的人，背部下面的肌筋，很容易受到不良影響，又婦女們對於臀部的肥大，感覺不滿，而亟圖設法减小者，當然不乏其人本期所刊的第十八式，對於他及她們，實在是最有效的一種練習，做時須注意，腿宕前宕後，均須儘可能宕至最大程度，並須勿觸地，又腰部須絕對保持均衡，而上身則不可搖動。</p>
<p>第十九式功能使腸胃及腎臟，因感受相當壓力而增加其活動，做時上身須挺直，不可以下頷向下，凑近膝部。</p>
<p>第二十式，功能使腹部肌筋，愈能發揮其維護器管之功用，而治脊梁部份之肌筋，則因此得有伸縮之機會，以增益其强固，做時有對於挺直兩膝不易辦到，則可用一固定之架，或用皮帶或粗索結環於板壁上，而以脚尖伸於其中。</p>
<p>（Ａ八十及八十圖）身體側臥，右腰著地，以右手置左臀上，左腿向前後宕動，宕時膝須挺直，腳尖須向下，複做六次，記數以每值腿向後宕爲一次。再轉身側臥，以左腰著地，右腿向前宕動，亦複做六次</p>
<p>（Ａ九十及九十圖）身體側臥，右腰著地，以右手枕頭，左手置左臀上，引左膝向上，使接近下頷，足尖須向下，複做六次，記數以每值腿伸直還原狀爲一次。�轉身側臥，以左腰著地，引右膝向上，亦複做六次（第二組完）</p>
<p>（圖十）身體平臥，兩手互握置頭後，起上身作坐勢，並儘可能向前傾，還原狀，複做六次，記數以每值回至平臥原狀一次，做時須注意兩膝挺直而勿屈曲</p>
<h3>丁仲祜姑丈不做壽之我見</h3>
<p>— 王螢</p>
<p>瑩世居無錫·民國二十六年十月遭亂，避難於長沙，後往香港，由香港輾轉至上海，承丁仲祜姑丈招瑩母子等同居。在此生活程度高漲之下，迄今巳五年矣。此五年中，見姑丈所撰各書，在儒敎書內，當以少年進德錄爲最。在衛生長壽書內，當以衛生書十四種爲最。在算學書內，當以算學書目提要爲最。在小學書內，當以說文解字詁林及補編爲最。在古泉學書內，當以古泉大辭典，歷代古泉圖說爲最。在佛學書內，當以佛學大辭典，及六祖壇經箋注爲最。在醫學書內，當以近世內科全書，新本草綱目爲最。在道敎書內，當以靜坐法精義，老子道德經箋注，道藏精華錄一百種爲最。此外有爾雅詁林，羣雅詁林，釋名詁林，方言詁林，及說文詁簡編等書尙未出版。李審言先生嘗曰，「先生爲千載傳人，即此刊書功德，接人以袣，中國二十八行省，欲別覓與先生相偶者，千披萬索，恐亦不得而同也。」觀姑丈刋行著述之豐富，李先生之言，耍非過譽。姑丈平時對於飲食，與家人從同，未嘗另添佳肴美點，雖惠康表兄，時有甘旨之奉，亦必遍餉家人，衣服亦甚樸素。每晨六時即起，看書讀書著書，無片刻暇晷。上月滬上各界發起姑丈六秩晋九不做壽之紀念。各日報叉大爲揄揚。瑩日將此等文字剪貼於空白簿上，姑丈見之，以爲外界稱譽太過，心殊悚然不安，乃援筆題詞其上曰，「社會人士，捧汝太高·從高跌下，或至於死。汝其自視，道德學問，孰有是處。名過其實，天將罰汝，折福减算，吾爲此懼。寡過未能，汝其殆歟？」瑩錄此可以見姑丈嚴於責己，欿然不自滿足之意。昔遽伯玉行年五十，而知四十九年之非。今姑丈以古稀之年，猶曰寡過未能。然則姑丈之不做壽，豈自視無可壽之處，而有伯玉知非之意，寓於其間歟？</p>
<p>丁福保老先生生平不做壽的主張實在含有壽人濟世的深意，此番以所收壽儀，悉數捐助本報助學金及上海福幼院，對於淸寒學子，孤苦幼兒，固然是極大的恩惠，對於整個社會福利的推進，亦且有莫大的幫助。明天是丁老先生六秩晋九大壽的正日，本刊謹以十二分誠意，恭祝這位老人家精神　鑠，老而彌健。</p>
<h3>疇隱居士嘉言錄</h3>
<p>— 弢</p>
<p>丁福保先生年高德劭，一言一行，足爲靑年楷模，以下所錄，均先生嘉言，可供吾人作座右銘者。疇隱居士，先生之別署也。　——編者——</p>
<p>命運雖定，吿可以人力改造之，如改造孱弱者爲强壯，改造病夫爲無病，改造短壽者爲壽翁，改造到處碰壁之際遇為一帆風順，此即所謂奪命也。</p>
<p>失敗者到處碰壁，成功者到處亨通，今欲變失敗而爲成功，須將懶惰改造爲勤勞，奢侈改爲節約，驕傲改造爲謙恭虛僞改造爲誠實，懦怯改造爲勇敗，嫉妒改造爲幫助，殘忍改造爲博愛，遲疑改造爲敏捷，放恣改造爲謹愼，躁急改造爲忍耐，悲觀改造爲樂觀，久之則非但心身為之改造，即命運亦為之改造矣。</p>
<p>半生擾攘，祗在追求功名利祿者，不能謂爲有意義之人生。然而絕名棄利，遁世入山，亦非有意義之人生，是爲薄志之徒，不能堪人生競爭者也。</p>
<p>夫有足能步，有手能握，有目能視，有耳能聽，有口能食且談，有精神可以判斷，理解，思索，發明，是爲人之活動力也。有此活動力之處，即人生也，無活動力之處，即墳墓也。人旣有天賦之活動力，即應振作精神，自强不息。</p>
<p>人固不能無活動，但損害他人之活動，則爲道德之罪人，法律之罪人，斷無可許之理。祗爲私利私慾而活動，則爲小人，無論其活動如何旺盛，皆不足稱。所謂社會者，乃多數人相集合，互有翻連之謂，人不應祗知有個人，應更進而謀社會一般之福利，是爲構成社會之義務。除此以外，無人生之目的。爲社會盡力，爲人道盡力，爲國家盡力，方爲有用之人，爲最能了解人生意義之人，爲最能活動之人，爲最能盡其人生責任之人。</p>
<p>說人之短，須先自己想想我有多少壞處，若未改好，何暇評論他人。</p>
<p>書籍者，索居之良友，失塗之導師，無助者之佳伴，果寢饋於其中，能使飢者忘共食，寒者忘其衣，病者忘其痛苦，貧者忘其困乏，憂者忘其悒鬱，兼能增人之壽，益人之廣識學問，而使人精神愉快之一物也。</p>
<p>作事當堅忍勇毅，於千辛萬阻之中，不許有半個難字出諸口，愈困難，愈　危，而我必有駕而上之之魄力，以戰退此羣魔，以達我之目的。</p>

<h3>木屐</h3>
<p>— 顧天一</p>
<p>熱天的拖鞋，好像汗衫一樣，差不多每人少不了要備一雙，在家裏拖拖，比穿鞋子要輕鬆而凉快得多。</p>
<p>可是，在這百物昂貴的當兒，一雙皮拖鞋，得化上三四十元。再拿一雙繡花拖鞋來說罷，繡花的面子不算，配一雙底，也得化二十元錢。當然，最能適合於一般平民的拖鞋，祗有用木展來代替了。</p>
<p>說起木展，首推廣東貨，眞够得上稱一聲「刮叫」。跣足穿着，其舒適不亞於拖鞋，並且還有花漆的，不但舒適而又漂亮。要是把粗頭野腦的上海土產來比一下，眞有「天壤之別」。</p>
<p>這種廣東木屐，不但價錢比拖鞋廉。並且脚上有些齷齪，也可放在自來水下一沖，比穿拖鞋要便當。</p>
<p>要是你以爲穿着這「的篤的篤」的木屐太粗野。那末，你錯了，在這時候，只要求經濟實惠，何况，更有人正提倡赤膊，袒露自然美呢！</p>

<h3>American Saboteurs to Undergo Military Trial</h3>
<p>Washington, 31st (Havas Agency)</p>
<p>In the case of the so-called "Nazi saboteurs," President Roosevelt previously ordered a special military tribunal to try the case. The German defendants expressed dissatisfaction and appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, opposing the jurisdiction of the military tribunal and requesting the implementation of habeas corpus procedures. After the Supreme Court heard the appeal, it ruled that the cases committed by the defendants were of a military nature and should be tried by a military tribunal, thereby rejecting the appeal. It is generally believed that this action by the court is tantamount to acknowledging the legality of President Roosevelt's special powers. In other words, it elevates executive power while reducing the power of Congress and conflates acts of sabotage with acts of espionage. During the American Civil War, a man named Milligan attempted to set fire to New York. At that time, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the defendant was not a spy and could not be tried by a military tribunal.</p>

<p>Washington, 31st (Havas Agency) - Officially announced, Soviet Ambassador to the United States Litvinov met with Secretary of State Hull today to exchange diplomatic notes, deciding to extend the 1937 U.S.-Soviet trade agreement for another year, extending it to August 6, 1943.

<h3>Gandhi Says Guarantee of Indian Independence After the War Is Difficult to Accept</h3>
<p>India Demands Immediate Independence Now</p>
<p>Manila, 1st (Domei News Agency) - According to a New Delhi report, Gandhi stated yesterday that any British proposal allowing India to be independent after the end of the war, even if guaranteed by the United States, would be difficult for him to accept. When asked if the Soviet Union, Chongqing, and the United States would guarantee Indian independence after the war, would his large-scale civil disobedience movement be cancelled, Gandhi replied that India demands independence now.</p>
<p>Mumbai, 31st (Havas Agency) - Gandhi's follower, Patel, told the press today, "The civil disobedience movement, that is, the passive resistance movement, will begin soon. It will generally be launched one week after the National Congress Party passes the secondary proposal."</p>
<p>London, 31st (Havas Agency) - The Times of London commented on the recent situation in India today, saying, "In the midst of the war crisis, we must not, as Gandhi says, give up British rule in India. As for the issue of defending India, we should cooperate with the Indian National Congress Party to the extent possible, but when we cannot cooperate with it, we should act alone. Normal order must be maintained within India. If India implements passive resistance, then our attitude must be firm and clear, and Indians must not be allowed to harbor any hopes of luck. In short, Sir Cripps' proposals to the Indian leaders should remain valid, but this is not the time for pointless discussions."</p>
<p>Nehru Talks About the Issue of Independence</p>
<p>Lisbon, Domei News Agency - According to a report from Allahabad, Nehru, former president of the Indian National Congress Party, recently stated that India's independence is a prerequisite for future negotiations with Britain. The round table conference proposed by the Indian freedom group is "unacceptable to us" because it will return to the old methods that have proven to be laborious and fruitless. In addition, other news revealed that the Indian Communist Party sent a telegram to the leaders of the American and British Communist Parties, requesting assistance for India to demand the establishment of an independent national government. Revere was sent to the United States, urging the American Communist Party to request President Roosevelt to telegram Britain, requesting the British government to negotiate with the Indian government to establish an independent Indian national government.</p>
<h3>Second Front is About to Open</h3>
<p>Germany Strengthens Western European Defenses</p>
<p>Swedish Capital, 1st (Haitong News Agency) - According to reports from the British capital, several London newspapers on Thursday carried a speech by Labor Minister Bevin in the House of Commons, stating that British munitions factories have increased the employment of female workers because Britain will have huge losses in the military. From this, it can be seen that the second front is about to open. Regarding this matter, the newspapers also stated that the number of anti-aircraft gunners employed by the home defense forces has also increased, because 100,000 people must serve on the front line. At the same time, the newspapers warned the public not to have extravagant hopes for the second battlefield, because preparations will take a considerable amount of time and cannot be done hastily. In addition, several newspapers reprinted American newspaper editorials, requesting that the issue of the second battlefield be discussed with an objective attitude. The American newspapers also stated that the United States is sending troops to Europe not to spend the holidays there.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 1st (Haitong News Agency) - The New York Times stated, "Only military experts can decide whether or not to open the second front." The newspaper hinted that neither Roosevelt nor Churchill could solve this problem, because they are politicians, and military affairs are only part of their work. Since this matter concerns the survival of Britain and the United States, the solution to the problem cannot be decided solely by them. The newspaper continued, "This matter has not yet been decided, because General Marshall's power cannot command Admiral King, and King has no right to command Marshall. This situation has not changed even after Leahy took office as Chief of Staff. Therefore, what is most needed at present is to establish a supreme commander who is responsible for deciding important matters. American newspapers believe that the supreme commander should be an American. However, the New York Daily Mirror believes that due to the urgency of the situation in all fronts, this supreme commander should be an Englishman. The New York Daily News requested Britain to open the second battlefield, saying, "Although the British have understood that two million troops cannot land in one place, then why are the British leaders still waiting for more reinforcements from the American army?" Determination, but Roosevelt and Churchill should make a decision. We should wait and see."</p>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Haitong News Agency) - According to military correspondent Wamppo, the fortresses on the Atlantic coast are equipped with the best weapons and are greater than the Siegfried Line.

There are also naval and submarine bases along the Atlantic coast. In addition to German workers, French and Belgian workers are assisting in constructing new European defenses.</p>
<h3>"Motor King Ford" Celebrates 79th Birthday</h3>
<p>Talks About World Transportation Issues</p>
<p>Lisbon, 1st (Domei News Agency) - According to a Detroit report, "Motor King" Ford released a letter to the world on his 79th birthday yesterday, stating that after the end of the war, cargo planes will play an important role in solving world transportation problems, but private planes may not be as popular as private cars.</p>
<p>Washington, 31st (Havas Agency) - Kessel, a giant in the American arms manufacturing industry, recently advocated building 5,000 seventy-ton transport planes to avoid submarine attacks on sea transportation. This man arrived here yesterday and gave a speech at the National Press Club, explaining his reasons, strongly advocating transporting goods to Britain by air instead of the current maritime transportation system, in order to avoid the continued heavy losses suffered by Allied merchant ships. This proposal has now become the center of discussion here, but some experts believe that this plan is impractical. Air transport can transport at most 5,000 tons per week, and building giant aircraft can hinder other sectors of the aircraft industry, because the total amount of raw materials in the United States is limited.</p>
<h3>Rumor of Churchill Flying to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 1st (Haitong News Agency) - According to unconfirmed rumors, British Prime Minister Churchill has flown to the Soviet Union to explain Britain's attitude towards the Soviet Union's request to open the second front to Stalin.</p>
<h3>Differences of Opinion Within the British Labor Party</h3>
<p>Swedish Capital, 1st (Haitong News Agency) - According to news from London, British newspapers are propagating signs of a split in the Labor Party, but the Labor Party's organ newspaper, the Daily Herald, stated that the Labor Party will not split, and all rumors are merely speculation. However, neutral people also believe that the Labor Party's opinions are divergent and difficult to reconcile. According to the Liberal Party's organ newspaper, the News Chronicle, only 18% of the 168 Labor Party members of the House of Commons are under 50 years old. The average age of Conservative and Liberal Party members is lower than that of the Labor Party. Older trade union leaders cannot easily formulate plans for the new world, nor can they complete the construction of the new world.</p>
<h3>New York Blackout</h3>
<p>New York, 1st (Havas Agency) - Several minutes before 10 o'clock last night, the air defense authorities suddenly implemented a blackout without issuing any warnings. The entire city was plunged into darkness for 20 minutes.</p>

Next, Prime Minister Laval proposed to the State Council to prohibit the public from holding demonstrations in order to avoid causing domestic unrest. The State Council immediately decided that anyone found illegally possessing explosives and ordnance should be sentenced to death.</p>
<h3>Grand Duchess Anna of Luxembourg Passed Away Yesterday in New York</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 1st (Haitong News Agency) - Grand Duchess Anna of Luxembourg, who had undergone surgery (abdominal disease) in New York several weeks ago, finally passed away last night due to her old age and frailty, at the age of eighty-one. Grand Duchess Anna was originally a princess of Portugal. She married Grand Duke William of Luxembourg on June 21, 1883, and had six daughters, but no sons. The Grand Duke died in 1912, and her eldest sister, Adelheid, ascended the throne, but was forced to abdicate by Britain and France in 1919 due to her pro-German relations. Her sister Charlotte succeeded to the throne. When the German army invaded the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg in May 1940, the monarch, accompanied by the Grand Duchess and some relatives, fled to the United States. Last night, when the Grand Duchess was on her deathbed, Grand Duchess Charlotte was still attending to her bedside. The Grand Duchess's mother was a Duchess of Luxembourg, Germany, and was very fond of German culture.</p>

<p>Moscow, 1st (Domei News Agency) - The German and Soviet forces in southern Russia have reached the stage of major decisive battle. The outcome of this battle will determine the fate of the Caucasus. The Soviet military authorities have now abandoned their strategy of retreat and have decided to stand their ground for a decisive battle. According to yesterday's editorial in the News, "Our army must face the offensive of Hitler's army with a wall of resistance." The order of the motherland is: "Not one step back!" The order of the nation is: "Not one step back!" Stalin's order is also: "Not one step back!" The Red Star also published a similar editorial, stating, "Our army must repel the enemy at any cost. The Red Army has only one slogan: 'Rather die than retreat one step!'" The order of the Soviet High Command also encourages all officers and soldiers in this way.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters report from Moscow, Timoshenko's army is desperately trying to block the German advance on Stalingrad, regardless of all sacrifices. The Germans are bombing the bridges over the Volga River in an attempt to cut off the Soviet supply lines. Soviet anti-aircraft guns are firing, and both sides are engaged in air battles. General Bock has mobilized 600,000 troops from all fronts for a southward offensive. The tension of the battle situation can be imagined. The Soviet newspaper "News" also recognized the tension of the battle situation, and on the 31st, it appealed to the Red Army soldiers to do their best to prevent the German advance, saying, "As long as we have a breath, even an inch of land should be defended."</p>
<p>Moscow, 1st (Havas Agency) - The Soviet Information Bureau announced this morning that on the lower Don front, although our army fought bravely, enemy motorized units and armored units broke through our defense line south and southeast of Bataisk.

<p>Berlin, 1st (Haitong News Agency) - The German High Command announced yesterday that enemy troops on the Leningrad front attempted to cross the Neva River by small boats, but were defeated by our army. On the Rezhev front, enemy attacks also failed and 40 enemy tanks were destroyed by us.</p>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Haitong News Agency) - Lieutenant General Bernuth, Chief of Staff of the German Tank Corps, was killed in action in Eastern Europe. When the bad news came, those who heard it sighed with regret.</p>

There was a major battle in the Don River basin yesterday, destroying 48 enemy tanks. An oil tanker and seven cargo ships were sunk in the Volga River, and another 16 cargo ships were damaged. North of Rzhev, the Soviet army repeatedly attacked after fierce fighting, but was defeated. Our infantry shot down four enemy aircraft. The enemy army, which launched a large-scale offensive against our bridgehead fortresses, engaged in hand-to-hand combat with our army and was finally defeated.</p>
<h3>German Command Announces Occupation of Salsk City</h3>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Haitong News Agency) - As fierce fighting is occurring west of Kalach, the gateway to Stalingrad, German forces advancing southward have accelerated their progress and occupied Salsk, a crucial railway hub southeast of Rostov. German mechanized units have passed through multiple points on the railway between Krasnodar and Stalingrad. The German advance in this area has been very rapid. Yesterday, they routed several retreating Soviet units and encircled them. The annihilation of these units is underway. There is fierce fighting in the area west of Kalach, east of the Don River bend. Soviet forces are attempting to resist to the end. Berlin believes the battles are favorable to the German side. Soviet forces launched a local offensive north of Voronezh, but the situation has not changed significantly. Soviet forces launched a rescue offensive in the area north of Rzhev, suffering heavy losses and being repulsed again. The Spanish volunteer division repulsed a Soviet offensive in the Volkhov area, achieving great success, and the Soviet forces suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Haitong News Agency) - It was announced here last night that German forces continue to advance in Soviet territory and have captured two important industrial towns in the Rostov area: Shakhty and Kamensk-Shakhtinsky. Shakhty is located in the northeastern corner of the Donets Basin, along the Rostov-Moscow railway line. The anthracite coal produced in the surrounding areas is of excellent quality. The area is the largest coal-producing region in the Soviet Union, accounting for 10% of the total Soviet output. In 1939, the population was 155,000. Since then, due to the development of the mining industry in the area, the population has increased significantly. There are several important factories in the area, including the Kuybyshev Machine Plant. In addition, there is a large-scale hydroelectric power plant.</p>
<h3>Stalin Personally Drafts Plan for Soviet General Counteroffensive</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 1st (Havas News Agency) - The battle for the Caucasus oil fields is at its peak. The German summer offensive has now reached its sixth week.</p>
<p>It has now entered an important new phase. Soviet troops have also launched a general counteroffensive from Tsimlyanskaya to the bend of the Don River to save the city of Stalingrad. This counteroffensive plan was personally drafted by Stalin, with the aim of causing such heavy losses to the German forces that the offensive would extinguish itself, as was the case with the offensive against Moscow last autumn. The ferocity of the fighting on the Don River bend has also been acknowledged by the Axis forces. Although the Berlin military authorities have not elaborated on the situation of this British counteroffensive, three points are implicitly made, which are worth noting: 1. The battles on the Don River bend have lost much of their significance compared to the speed of the German advance south of Rostov. 2. The German forces facing Stalingrad have not yet crossed the Don River. Currently, only aircraft are bombing Stalingrad. Ground troops have not yet reached the stage of attacking the city. Yesterday's reports that Stalingrad was threatened from both the north and south are also inaccurate. The German plan originally intended to concentrate all its forces to capture the Maikop oil fields in one go. Their troops have already advanced 100 miles from the lower reaches of the Don River, only halfway to their destination. However, Soviet troops have been able to concentrate in the vicinity of Krasnodar and on the north bank of the Kuban River in time to prevent the German forces from breaking through. According to Soviet intelligence, there are only ten German divisions south of Rostov, while the Soviet side has a large force of fifty divisions assembled in the area from Tsimlyanskaya to the Don River.</p>
<p>Paris, 1st (Haitong News Agency) - A unit of French volunteers left Versailles yesterday to join the French Legion on the Eastern Front.</p>
<h3>French Ship Encountered British Submarine</h3>
<p>Vichy, 31st (Havas News Agency) - The Navy Department has just announced that on the 26th of this month, the French ship "Medea", carrying a cargo of grains, wine, and minerals, was sailing from Oran, North Africa, back to Marseille and was not carrying any wartime contraband. Unexpectedly, it encountered a British submarine in the middle of the journey, which signaled and ordered it to stop. Subsequently, a French destroyer, a patrol ship, and a squadron of aircraft were dispatched to rescue it. The ship was then able to regain its freedom and safely arrive at the port of Marseille.</p>
<h3>Both Sides in North Africa Actively Strengthen Defenses - Italy Believes British Troop Concentration at El Alamein is a Sign of a Large-Scale Counteroffensive</h3>
<p>Rome, 1st (Haitong News Agency) - According to military sources here, the British concentration of large forces in the coastal area of El Alamein indicates that the British will soon launch a large-scale counteroffensive. Currently, there is only artillery fire and reconnaissance activity on the North African front.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 1st (Haitong News Agency) - London newspapers report that in the Egyptian theater of war, both sides are sparing no effort to strengthen their defensive works in the El Alamein area. It is reported that General Rommel has laid a large number of landmines, making the outer defenses of the German positions even stronger. It is said that the landmines laid by the Germans this time are mostly British landmines that the Germans cleared around Mersa Matruh. How can the British not feel ashamed and embarrassed upon hearing this?</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Egyptian border, 31st (Havas News Agency) - In the past 24 hours, the activities of the Axis and British forces in the El Alamein area have been limited to scouting parties, and most of the activities have occurred at night. The reason for this is probably that both sides need to reorganize their forces after the fierce fighting that occurred three days ago. According to military experts, this situation may continue for a considerable period of time, as both belligerents have recently had ample opportunity to strengthen their defenses. At present, both sides have built solid positions in the narrow strip of land from the coast to the Qattara Depression. Any attempt to break through the positions will be difficult to achieve. In addition to stepping up work on the front lines to strengthen defenses, both sides are also expanding the minefields, establishing anti-tank positions and other obstacles behind the first line of defense. The air forces of both sides are also limited to reconnaissance activities. Only German and Italian aircraft bombed the port of Alexandria once yesterday.</p>
<p>Cairo, 31st (Havas News Agency) - The Egyptian Ministry of Interior announced that Axis aircraft bombed the port of Alexandria last night, killing 17 civilians and injuring 4. Other material losses were minimal.</p>
<p>German-Made Trains Transporting Soil</p>
<p>Istanbul, 31st (Havas News Agency) - The Ministry of Transport announced today that a large number of German-made railway vehicles have been arriving in Turkey in the past month, including 14 locomotives and 248 passenger and freight cars. Another 315 vehicles are expected to be delivered soon.</p>
<h3>Finnish Envoy Presents Credentials to Pope</h3>
<p>Vatican City, 1st (Haitong News Agency) - The first Finnish envoy to the Holy See, Karl Britus, was received by the Pope yesterday morning at 10:00 to present his credentials. The embassy secretary, Stenius, accompanied him. The Pope delivered a short speech praising the Finnish people.</p>
<p>Vatican City, 31st (Havas News Agency) - The first Finnish envoy to the Holy See, Karl Britus, presented his credentials to Pope Pius XII this afternoon. The Finnish envoy delivered a speech in French, expressing his hope that the relations between his country and the Holy See would become closer. The Pope responded, elaborating on the role of Catholicism in Finland and offering blessings to the country. After the ceremony, they engaged in a brief private conversation. The envoy then took his leave.</p>
<h3>North African Anti-Aircraft Guns Shoot Down British Aircraft</h3>
<p>Vichy, 1st (Havas News Agency) - Officials announced today that a British aircraft flew over the port of Casablanca, French North Africa, yesterday afternoon and was hit by anti-aircraft fire, crashing into the sea near Marrakesh.</p>
<h3>Mysterious Egypt (6)</h3>
<p>The true Egyptians are descendants of the Han Chinese who remain in Egypt, numbering only over 800,000, which is less than the number of foreign Semitic peoples. Most of them believe in Islam, while fewer believe in Christianity and Judaism.</p>
<p>In the countryside of Egypt, Egyptians are everywhere. They are mostly engaged in farming, so they have a special name: Fellah, meaning farmers. The French anthropologist authority in "History of Oriental Races" described the Egyptians vividly. He said: "In the Egyptian countryside, there is only one typical figure. The images carved on the walls of the temples and tombs of Thebes and Memphis are a perfect depiction of them. They are tall and thin, with broad and flat shoulders, arched backs, flexible arms, long fingers and palms, weak legs, and slender, arched feet. Their heads are not long, their faces are oval, their foreheads are slightly slanted backward, their eyes are large and bright, their noses are large and high, their mouths are wide and their lips are thick, their teeth are small but extremely neat, and their ears are high and close to their heads."</p>
<p>Now you can imagine the appearance of these farmers. As for their habits, people used to just echo each other and say how good they were, but the truth is far from reality. This anthropologist was able to describe them accurately based on scientific spirit. He wrote: "The farmers look distressed, their eyes contain a light of fear, they walk as if uneasy, and their hands tremble, as if always asking for help. They are mostly numb and obedient, and do not know right from wrong."</p>
<p>According to Piotbey, a modern scholar, they have no conscience, no personality, no sense of ethnicity, no faith, no distinction between good and evil, and no spirit of mutual assistance. These Egyptians are truly a group of pitiful insects. They have never been able to raise their heads since the invasions of the Arabians, Persians, and others. The reason why Egypt's independence movement has never been as smooth as India's is largely due to this kind of national character.</p>
<p>On the other hand, they also have excellent qualities. They are honest and reliable and never lie. What is most commendable is their enthusiasm for work. Due to this characteristic, Egyptians can make barren deserts produce a large amount and turn a country without rain into a major agricultural country in the world.</p>
<p>More than three-fifths of the people in Egypt are farmers. There is one type of farmer, the first type being day laborers who are hired and laid off at will. Their daily wage is only three Egyptian Piastres, which is less than one French franc. All the expenses of their families depend on this meager income. An average Egyptian farmer has at least five or six children. Imagine how they can live such a life. Therefore, children often work before they become adults, earning half a Piastre to supplement the family income. Due to old customs, women do not show their faces in public. When they go out, they wear black clothes, black veils, and cover their faces, so only two eyeballs can be seen. They usually only eat barley cakes, drink Nile water, chew broad beans and peas, and gnaw sugarcane stalks from the fields, which costs less than one Egyptian pound. They also do not cook their dishes, so they are very frugal. This system is prevalent in the Egyptian district, and also exists in the Nile Delta, but the wages are higher. Because the climate in Egypt is warm and they can farm all year round, they are not without work. They use up today's wages today, and there is work for tomorrow. Although they are hard-working, they are also carefree.</p>

<h3>City Authorities Consider Air Defense Measures - Baosjia Personnel Receive Air Defense Training - General Police Station Converted to Air Defense Headquarters</h3>
<p>According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, the Tongmeng News Agency reported today (1st) that the Shanghai Municipal Council, together with the Consular Body, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the French Municipal Council, are currently considering various specific air defense measures, such as the effective use of the entire Shanghai Baosjia system for civil air defense, and providing air raid light control training to the broad population of Shanghai's forty different nationalities. Following the announcement by the Japanese Army and Navy commanders in Shanghai on July 29 that all residents are responsible for cooperating with the authorities in civil air defense, joint meetings have been held continuously between the various authorities to agree on the various rules that the public must comply with during air raids. The final air defense regulations have not yet been drafted, but a pilot program has been drafted, which includes the following measures: 1. Mobilizing the entire Baosjia system; 2. Converting the General Police Station into the Air Defense Headquarters; 3. Converting the branch police stations into Air Defense Sub-Headquarters; 4. Naming each Baosjia unit as an Air Defense Brigade; 5. Each police station is responsible for providing preliminary air defense training to the Baosjia personnel within its jurisdiction, as well as training on how to cope with actual air raid situations. It is reported that the Baosjia system, sirens, and electric bells currently in use will be used for air raid warnings.</p>
<h3>Fifth Ration of Grain Concluded Yesterday</h3>
<p>Rations Issued Tomorrow Based on Certificates - Flour Quality Improved</p>
<p>The fifth period of household rice distribution for the two concessions ended at 6:00 PM yesterday. It will expire today. Starting August 3rd, rice shops will sell the fifth period of household rice based on the fifth ration certificate. The quantity and price are the same as the fourth period, without any changes.</p>
<p>Total Amount of Rice Withdrawn by Rice Shops</p>
<p>The amount of household rice that the rice shops designated by the Shanghai Municipal Council Rice and Grain Office withdrew from Taikoo and Zhejiang Xingye Warehouses was completed yesterday. The total amount was 16,980 bags of white rice and 45,285 bags of flour for the Public Concession, and 9,980 bags of white rice and 25,725 bags of flour for the French Concession. The purchase price remained 309.30 yuan per bag of white rice and 93 yuan per bag of flour.</p>
<p>Disposal Measures for Remaining Shuangma Flour</p>
<p>Previously, many rice shops in the two concessions had Shuangma brand flour (produced by Dongfu Company) allocated by the Shanghai Municipal Council Rice and Grain Office left over because it contained fine sand, which made citizens unwilling to purchase it. The Rice and Grain Office has notified the rice shops to report the remaining amount of this flour. There has been no indication of how to dispose of it. However, the Rice and Grain Office has selected the flour currently allocated to rice shops, and the allocation of Shuangma brand flour has been stopped.</p>
<h3>British and Other Nationals to be Evacuated Tomorrow - Ship Tickets Issued Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, British and Allied nationals who have gathered in Shanghai from the occupied areas to await repatriation began receiving ship tickets this morning (1st) and are packing their luggage in preparation for departure. Seventy-eight British nationals from Hankou and Jiujiang are scheduled to arrive here this afternoon. By then, the 320 people departing on the Tatsuta Maru will have all arrived in Shanghai. The Tatsuta Maru is scheduled to depart from Shanghai on Sunday. The nationals to be evacuated are preparing for departure at the Columbia Country Club, just like the American nationals who left Shanghai on the Conte Verde last month. Their ages range from seven to seventy years old. Those who have lived in China for more than forty years are inevitably sad to leave. They are all scheduled to gather in front of the Customs House at 1:00 PM on Monday and board the Tatsuta Maru by ferry. The Kamakura Maru is scheduled to arrive here on August 10th, carrying approximately 530 British and Allied nationals, and depart on August 16th.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Branch of the Clean-Up Committee Established Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Clean-Up Committee began its work on July 1, 1941, focusing on the counties of Suzhou, Changshu, Taicang, Kunshan, Cheng, and Wuxi in Jiangsu Province. After a year of promotion, it recently launched the first phase of clean-up work in the southeastern Taihu Lake area. The Shanghai Branch of the Clean-Up Committee was presided over by Chen Gongbo, who also served as the Deputy Chairman. The preparatory committee was established first and completed its work on July 31st, handing it over to the Shanghai Branch of the Clean-Up Committee. The Shanghai Branch held a grand opening ceremony in the assembly hall of the association yesterday (1st) at 10:00 AM. Major General Miyazaki, head of the special service agency, Major General Fuse, commander of the Shanghai garrison, Colonel Igarashi, director of the Clean-Up Department of the special service agency, and many senior staff members attended. The ceremony was simple and grand. After the ceremony, an announcement was issued, officially establishing the branch and beginning its work.</p>
<h3>140 Shanghai Postal Workers Transferred to Serve in Other Cities</h3>
<p>One hundred and forty postal workers from the Postal Administration were transferred to serve in post offices in other cities.

The postal economy is still very difficult, so the resumption of parcel services is being actively planned.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Continues to Announce Bread Allocation Measures</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office announced that, regarding the implementation of bread allocation measures, a public announcement was issued yesterday. It has been found that among the registered residents, only those with foreign names are given white bread certificates.

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council General Secretary Sends Letter of Thanks to Jordan</h3>

<h3>Strict Penalties Set to Prevent Stores from Deliberately Violating Price Limits - Suspension of Business, Fines, or Revocation of Licenses for Price Gouging, Hoarding, or Deceptive Practices</h3>
<p>Although the problem of stabilizing prices has been carried out jointly by various municipal authorities, there are still some unscrupulous merchants who are driven by greed and act against regulations. Therefore, the relevant price control agencies have had to take more precise measures and at the same time set more universal penalties, which will be implemented from today. Any store or business that has one of the following situations will be fined between 500 yuan and 5,000 yuan in addition to the revocation of its business license: 1. Arbitrarily raising prices for sale in violation of the prices set by the local competent authorities; 2. Falsely claiming that goods are out of stock and refusing to put them on the market in order to hoard them, even after applying for price changes that have not yet been approved; 3. Changing the grade of goods or using inferior goods in order to deceive and profit. Those who commit one of the following situations will be fined between 300 yuan and 3,000 yuan. In the case of repeated offenses, their business licenses should also be revoked: 1. Not marking prices or using price tags in order to raise prices for sale; 2. Using secret codes on price tags in order to deceive and trick. Previously, the authorities of each city district had ordered all stores and businesses not to arbitrarily raise the prices of goods, nor to mix other qualities in the goods, or any other improper behavior. In addition, if there is a need to change prices due to cost factors, the industry association must submit a reason to the local government to request a change. If there is no industry organization, the majority of the industry in the area may directly approach the competent authority. Changes in prices may not be implemented without approval. At the same time, the goods sold should be priced item by item and hung in a conspicuous place in the business location. Those displayed for sale should be marked with price tags separately. Price tags may not use secret codes. The various regulations above are intended to prevent merchants from acting against regulations, so it is necessary to fully implement the penalties.</p>
<h3>Imported Merchant Ships Subject to Strict Quarantine</h3>
<p>The city's epidemic prevention is very strict. The Customs Quarantine Office pays close attention to imported ships. Except for ships coming from Shanghai along the Yangtze River, which can sail directly into port, all ships coming from Shanghai from the North and South Oceans must be approved by the Quarantine Office before they can enter the port. Otherwise, they will anchor at Sanjiashui outside the Wusongkou to wait for inspection. The Donga Shipping Company's Songshan Maru came to Shanghai from Hong Kong and Guangzhou on the afternoon of July 30th and anchored in Sanjiashui to wait for inspection. It was inspected yesterday morning and entered the port. The ship was quarantined outside the Wusongkou for a total of 48 hours. In addition, the company's Mingmen Maru, which runs the Shanghai-Ningbo line, came to Shanghai from Ningbo on the afternoon of the 31st. It also had to be quarantined before it could enter the port, so it anchored in Sanjiashui to wait for inspection. As of 7:00 PM yesterday, it had not been seen entering the port, presumably because the quarantine procedures had not yet been completed. The ship was originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai to Ningbo yesterday afternoon, so this shift was canceled. It is not known whether the next shift (on the 5th) will depart on schedule. The company is not sure and will have to wait for the ship to enter the port before making a decision.</p>
<h3>Shanghai West Nightclubs Delay Closing</h3>
<p>According to the English-language Shanghai Times, due to the request of the Shanghai West nightclubs, stating that the previously stipulated closing time of 11:00 PM was impossible to continue operating, the authorities have issued a notice, allowing the Shanghai West nightclubs to operate until 12:30 AM starting tonight (1st). The proposal to extend the operating hours of the nightclubs has been agreed to by the Chinese authorities, and Pan Da, the Shanghai West police chief, notified the owners and managers of the nightclubs yesterday afternoon. Pan stated that the extension of the nightclubs' operating hours was due to the livelihoods of the 500 to 600 employees of the nightclubs. As for all drinks and food sold in the nightclubs, they will still be subject to a 20% tax. The owners of the nightclubs seem to be satisfied with the extension of operating hours to 12:30 AM, although they had requested an extension to 2:00 AM in the morning. However, the current extension of 90 minutes has already increased revenue. However, in any case, it is still not enough to fully complete the final program of the nightclubs. Therefore, it is understood that the managers are planning a final request to the Chinese authorities. It is not yet certain whether the seven nightclubs that were closed on July 11 will reopen tonight. The regulation requiring Shanghai West nightclubs to close at 11:00 PM began at the outbreak of the Pacific War.</p>
<p>Wufu Stock Company Hosts Banquet</p>
<p>The Wufu Stock Company, located at 407 Xin Kang Building, Jiangxi Road, Second Avenue, will officially open on August 5th. The night before, a banquet was held at the Xindu Hotel to entertain colleagues, with more than 50 people attending. The managing director, Ma Wei, the assistant manager, Ma Weilian, and directors Lin Yiken and Pan Yangyao, provided hospitality. Chairman Xu Xiaochu gave a speech, welcoming colleagues. Directors Jin Zongcheng, Yang Bogeng, and Gu Keming gave speeches. Guests Zhou Bangjun, Wang Yingsheng, Yu Mingshi, and Mu Zhuangwu gave thank you speeches in turn, which was a great event.</p>

<h3>A Visit to the Shanghai Fuyou Orphanage</h3>
<p>Mr. Ding Fubao is deeply knowledgeable in academics and prolific in writing, and is respected in both medical and academic circles. In recent years, he has devoted himself to social causes and presides over the Fuyou Orphanage. Its facilities are complete and there is much to be said about it. The following is a mere glimpse of Mr. Ding's charity work.</p>
<p>"Love my children, and extend that love to the children of others." This is a manifestation of humanity's spirit of universal love. In recent years, child welfare in Shanghai has made considerable progress, which, although it is an adaptation to the needs of the environment, also shows that enthusiastic people in society are fully expressing this spirit of universal love. The Shanghai Fuyou Orphanage is, of course, an example of this spirit.</p>
<p>The director of the orphanage is Mr. Ding Fubao, who everyone is now celebrating his 69th birthday and donating birthday gifts to education and social causes. Mr. Ding has many characteristics in his life: he is good at maintaining his health, keeping his body in his twilight years as strong as a young man; in recent years, he rarely prescribes medicine for people, but often guides patients with new methods of food therapy, and patients have achieved remarkable results; he contributes all his spiritual and financial resources to society as much as possible; he has never made an exception to celebrate his birthday in his life. Therefore, I think that the orphanage, under the leadership of such an extraordinary old man, must also have many unique features. Moreover, the vice president of the orphanage, Mr. Ji Bin, is a Christian who, based on the Christian spirit of universal love and sacrifice, earnestly carries out child welfare work under Mr. Ding's guidance. Of course, it is like the green leaves setting off the peony, complementing each other. The orphanage is located at 101 Gongyi, Dongjiadu, in a three-story building. There are two courtyards in front and behind. The front courtyard has seven rooms, and the back courtyard has five rooms. There are no less than thirty or forty rooms of various sizes inside, including the kitchen. The house is quite spacious, and the interior is painted brand new, so it doesn't feel like an old-fashioned building at all. However, the window lattices are completely inlaid with oyster shells. For those of us who are used to bright and shiny glass windows, it feels like entering an ancient temple, full of ancient meaning. It is said that this building is rented to the orphanage completely free of charge by an anonymous owner. Therefore, I thought of a couplet I saw in the first chapter of *Liaozhai Zhiyi*, *Kaocheng Huang*: "If good deeds are done to be known, they are not truly good." This owner who does good without seeking recognition is truly worthy of our utmost admiration.</p>
<p>There are now about 150 or 160 children in the orphanage, the oldest being 14 or 15 years old, the youngest being 4 or 5 years old, and the majority being 7 or 8 years old. Some of these children are orphans without parents, and some are children whose parents are unable to support them and send them here to relieve some of the burden of life. There are also one or two street children who the orphanage has taken in themselves. I heard that when these children entered the orphanage, some were covered in scabies, and some were sallow and emaciated, as thin as firewood. Almost none of them were healthy. Now, although these children cannot be said to be all eating and drinking themselves fat and plump, most of them have rosy complexions, are lively and healthy, and rarely have a weak state. This is probably because the director of the orphanage, Mr. Ding Fubao, is a senior veteran in the medical field and an expert in the study of food nutrition. Under his guidance, foods rich in various vitamins are used to nourish these children, so their physical constitutions have been transformed so well.</p>
<p>There are a dozen teachers and staff here, but not a single worker. Because all the chores are done by the teachers and staff, helping the older children to do it themselves. This not only saves expenses on the one hand, but also cultivates the industrious habits of these children. This point can be learned by general children's homes. The teachers treat the children very kindly and teach them very seriously, treating other people's children as their own.</p>
<p>In terms of teaching, it is not just about teaching children to read dead books. It is about instilling living knowledge into the children's minds at any time and place. At the same time, it also emphasizes the combination of hands and brains, so that every child can give full play to their wisdom and exercise their physique. In everyday life, they are given as much knowledge as they should have as human beings. This kind of life education is very practical for the children's future.</p>
<p>In terms of hygiene, in addition to adopting new nutritional methods to improve the natural development of these children, they also pay attention to clean and tidy clothes. In addition, there is a gym and a bathroom, which are very beneficial to the children's health. In terms of health care, Dr. Hu Qipeng from the Cishu Health Association recently came to the orphanage to examine the bodies of each child. When a child is found to have suspected lung disease, they cooperate with the Anti-Tuberculosis Association, and the hospital of the Association provides free X-rays. If a child gets sick, there is a ward in the orphanage, and the nurse takes care of them. In serious cases, they are sent to the Moliai Road Children's Hospital, where the hospital provides free treatment, because the hospital also embraces a spirit of cooperation.</p>
<p>Behind the orphanage, there is also a large garden, where they grow things like corn and soybeans, leading the children to learn some common agricultural knowledge. In short, the orphanage is a newly opened children's paradise, with special gardeners cultivating the new lives of those 150 or 160 children. How can we make sure that it does not decline? Of course, it requires the full care and protection of enthusiastic people in society.</p>

<h3>Government Bonds Delivered with Coupons – Class A Rebounds Past the 40 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>In the unofficial market for government bonds, the upward trend became even stronger yesterday. Class A bonds once again broke through the 40 yuan mark, and Class C bonds also surged to 39 yuan, showing a very positive trend. Delivery still includes the 12th and 13th period coupons, so the market price should be calculated including both periods of interest. Therefore, although the market price has risen, if interest is excluded, it actually feels lower. Judging from the current environment, buying and selling can be made public, people's hearts are stable, the previous large sellers have stopped, and even floating sellers are at the end of their rope. Those who wanted to sell but haven't have changed their minds, and those who have already sold midway have also changed their path. An investigation into the ins and outs of each company will reveal the situation. For example, Rutile has been consistently buying, and its background strength is conceivable. Lianyi and Dazhong have also shown great interest in entering. Shunxiang was the main idea for the sales, but it has absorbed a lot in the past two days. Shuntai's absorption is the most recent new force, not to mention others. The sellers are Runli, Hongda, and Xinyi, and the others such as Rutong Kang, Xinhua, Hu Heji, Wuhe, and Datong are all selling more than they are buying. As a result, the market price continued to rise by six or seven jiao to one yuan and three jiao, with a turnover of nearly two million yuan. The Jianming table is listed below:</p>
<p>Most Chinese Stocks Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday's Chinese merchant stock market saw prices remain weak and sluggish amid sparse trading. In particular, the Cultural stocks, which have been stagnant for a week, saw a sharper decline. Commercial Press was down five yuan, and Zhonghua and Shijie were down two yuan and five jiao each. There were sellers looking to sell off to raise cash. Nanyang Tobacco was even more difficult to recover, falling by one and a half yuan. New Pharmaceuticals has turned firm and stable, with Xinya and Zhongfa rising by five jiao each. Minyi was down by more than one yuan alone. In the department store sector, Wing On was down slightly, and Sincere tended to be stable. Zhabei Water and Electricity was down another yuan. Italian Electricity was stagnant. Ning Shao Shipping had news of resumption of service soon, and the price was quite firm, rising to the 60 yuan mark. Guohuo and Lihua Company and Sanyou Industrial Co. had new buyers active. According to the trend of the day, it has changed from weak to flat. Moreover, the end of July has passed and the money supply has loosened. Prices in various markets are expected to rebound tomorrow (Monday). The market prices of each stock market are listed separately below:</p>
<p>Gold Ornament Prices at Silver Shops – Intra-Industry Trading Prices Initially Lower then Rebound</p>
<p>The retail price of gold ornaments at Daxin and other major silver shops in this city remained unchanged at 2,250 yuan per tael (purchase price reduced by 350 yuan). The intra-industry trading price was initially lower then rebounded. In the morning, the price was 1,990 yuan per tael, which was 10 yuan lower. Cash shops and others bought in, and then the price began to rebound, reaching a high of 1,965 yuan. At noon, it was 1,960 yuan, which was a difference of 25 yuan, up 10 yuan from the previous day. Trading was even more scarce. The price of silver ornaments remained unchanged at 16 yuan per tael, and the intra-industry trading price was 11.45 yuan.</p>
<p>Interbank Lending Rate Listed at Small Two Fen</p>
<p>The interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association suddenly listed at small two fen, which is 1.8 jiao. The new settlement and cash remained unchanged. In the foreign exchange market, although there were some small amounts of settlement for Japanese military scrip, the supply from fellow traders was also strong, trading at 5.555 yuan. Later, a premium of 0.2 fen was added before there were sellers. The buying and selling price between silver shops and money shops remains at 5.545 yuan and 5.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cold Drinks Prosper Under the Scorching Sun (Continued)</h3>
<p>Most of the cold drink product sections in stores during the summer are temporary establishments, such as fruit shops, tea shops, candy shops, tobacco and paper shops, and restaurants and dim sum shops, which only do business for one season in the summer. The cold drinks they sell are either self-made or purchased for resale. Because the profits are high, many people do it. Merchants must target the season to make a profit.</p>
<p>During this year's hot summer, because the price of watermelons is particularly expensive, costing more than ten yuan for a watermelon that is less than ten pounds, people are reluctant to buy them. Therefore, there are particularly many small vendors selling cold drinks. After paying for a permit, they carry a load on the street, selling "shaved ice and jelly." The red and green colors are unknown water, but the price is not the cheapest, and it costs two or three jiao of savings notes to quench the thirst for a moment. There are also Jiangbei children shouting along the street to sell machine ice and unknown popsicles, and business is not bad. The main customers of this kind of business are all from the lower classes, and they don't care about hygiene.</p>
<p>The slightly better roadside stalls selling cold drinks are made of a few pieces of wood and a few oranges to form a stall. The more sophisticated ones have a white cloth spread on the board, displaying white sugar in glass jars, a few glass cups, and an ice shaver. This is a shaved ice stall. Some also sell contract taxes, self-made ice cream, orange juice, and lemonade, which are much cheaper than in stores.</p>
<p>In short, under this hot summer sun, the hard-working people, due to the evaporation of sweat, have a particularly urgent need for water. The most practical thing is to eat a bowl of cool tea on the street, which only costs one jiao of savings notes, or the tea in the teahouses on the road run by good-doing charitable merchants, which is provided to passers-by for free when they are thirsty. There are also teahouses on the road set up by the Human Rickshaw Mutual Aid Association and the Qiushi Jun Three Education Association, which are everywhere, costing nothing, and are the most hygienic. Under the high pressure of the cost of living, this year's currency system has also changed. The merchants' minds are that this year's prices are not as good as last year's. The authorities have price controls on goods in legitimate stores, but the prices in food stores, whether the profits are high or low, depend on the conscience of the owners. Therefore, this year's cold drink business is particularly profitable. There are also particularly many people engaged in it, because although the price increase is alarming, there are still many people who buy to eat. However, these cold drink stalls are a great hindrance to hygiene. This year's cholera is rampant, and it is necessary to prohibit the sale of this kind of unhygienic cold drink. (Wen Hai)</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Highest Temperature – 99.9 Degrees</h3>
<p>The heat wave in this city has not subsided at all. Yesterday's highest temperature was still close to 100 degrees. The wind is calm, so the high heat is even greater. According to meteorological observations, there is no hope of cooling down yet. The prolonged sunny days have had a significant impact on crops. It has also been learned that yesterday's highest temperature was 99.9 degrees Fahrenheit (37.7 degrees Celsius).</p>

<p>Circular Croquet Charity Match - Ticket Sales Begin</p>
<p>Ticket sales for the Chang Yin Cup circular croquet charity match began yesterday. Zhang Jingxiao, the general manager of Great China Soap Company and Xin Da Trading Company, purchased 300 honorary tickets, totaling 1,000 National Currency. Mr. Shen Deming also purchased 100 tickets, totaling 500 yuan. Their enthusiasm is commendable.</p>
<h3>Stagnant Cotton Cloth Sales Show No Improvement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, cotton cloth remained quite sluggish, with both actual sales being scarce and market sentiment being weak. "Dragon Head" fine cloth for new orders closed at 178.5 yuan, while bank orders were at 153.5 yuan. "Flying Fish" fine cloth was at 158.5 yuan, and "Yanghe" was at 156 yuan. "Four Gentlemen" serge opened at 6.925 yuan and closed at 6.875 yuan. Factory cloth trading was quiet, and prices showed little fluctuation. 16-pound "Earth" coarse cloth was at 177 yuan, and "Flying Hong" was at 174 yuan. 12-pound "Fu Gui" fine cloth was at 159 yuan, with transactions. "Peach Blossom Lady" cloth opened at 259.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Speculation - Now Extinct</h3>
<p>Since the Cotton Yarn Association cracked down on trading, and to ensure caution, coupled with the hot weather, the market has been temporarily suspended to review the qualifications of member businesses and revise regulations, ensuring everything is clear before resuming operations. As a result, speculative trading has been completely eliminated, and the market prices for Shuangma factory orders have completely disappeared. As for the demand for actual yarn, it is relatively weak, and the market situation is trending towards fatigue.</p>
<h3>Tinplate - Retail Sales Still Lively</h3>
<p>Trading in hardware goods remained sluggish yesterday. Comparing retail and wholesale, the former was more lively than the latter. Wholesale transactions felt increasingly insignificant. Yesterday, retail sales of 24-gauge and 26-gauge tinplate were still relatively lively, with an estimated total of thirty or forty sheets traded throughout the day. Most of these were for small workshops making handicrafts, who had no choice but to purchase raw materials in order to maintain their livelihoods. However, the inventory of this tinplate in Shanghai is very thin, and it is no longer possible to purchase large quantities of spot goods. Therefore, those in the industry who hold this small amount of inventory are unusually astute and do not follow the trend of other hardware products, whose actual sales are difficult and whose market is softening. Thus, the standard prices for this product remain firm. For example, 24-gauge tinplate is selling for 120 yuan per sheet (transactions for this type are relatively rare), and 26-gauge tinplate is selling for 100 yuan per sheet (transactions for this type are still lively in the market, but mostly small amounts). The market price is said to be similar to before.</p>
<h3>Drought Leads to Soybean Cake Stagnation</h3>
<p>The supply and demand for beans remain dull and weak, with only occasional small transactions. The market shows little change, hovering around the same levels. 40 bags of Tianjin red beans were priced at 186 yuan. 10 bags of Chongming sandworms were priced at 110 to 111 yuan. Actual sales of soybean cake continue to be sluggish due to the drought, and most people are taking a wait-and-see attitude. Transactions are still lacking development, and the market situation is quite calm. 500 pieces of "Li" brand soybean cake from May were priced at 66 yuan. 200 bags of "Xing Ji" soybean cake warrants from March from Wan Gu Warehousing were priced at 59 yuan. Also, 1,000 pieces of Wan Gu Warehousing warrants from April were priced at 98.75 to 60 yuan. Also, 500 pieces of Yoshida Warehousing warrants were priced at 65 yuan.</p>
<p>Wheat bran sales remain weak, and the market trend is still softening. 100 bags of "San Xin" small-packaged wheat bran warrants dated May 27 were priced at 101 yuan.</p>
<p>Edible Sugar Deposit Temporarily Using Reserve Vouchers - Original Regulations Unchanged</p>
<p>The deadline for retailers to apply for purchasing various types of edible sugar this month has already passed. The Cooperation Business Office's regulations originally stipulated military currency as the standard for the sugar purchase deposit. However, due to requests from retailers, temporary permission has been granted to use Central Reserve Bank notes as a substitute, to show flexibility. However, the regulations of the office have not been changed.</p>
<h3>Tianmu Bamboo Shoots Market Weakens</h3>
<p>Recently, the market for green bamboo shoots has been stable due to limited inventory. However, the trend for Tianmu bamboo shoots is weakening. Previously, the market had reached 600 or 700 yuan, but now the holders are no longer holding firm, and are selling according to the market price. Therefore, they are only selling for around 500 yuan, compared to the more common goods. Some want to push the price of partial goods to 600 yuan, but it is not easy to achieve for the time being.</p>
<h3>Walnuts and Peach Kernels - Both Show Movement</h3>
<p>Walnuts that have been refrigerated recently began to be released. The average price is 182 yuan, with higher quality ones selling for over 200 yuan. There were no transactions for top-quality walnuts. The movement of peach kernels has slightly increased, with the average price being 500 yuan, Tianjin peach kernels at 560 yuan, and peach balls at 600 yuan.</p>
<p>Cigarette Price Evaluation Imminent</p>
<p>The cigarette market is sluggish due to stagnant sales across various channels. General hoarders were once agitated, but have since become calm and have no intention of making progress. Furthermore, due to the imminent price evaluation by the authorities, market sentiment is weak, and there is no force to raise prices. Yesterday's opening prices included "Great Britain" brand continuing small to 8,100 yuan, "Old Knife" brand at 5,100 yuan, "Pin Hai" brand at 4,300 yuan, "Wu Hua" brand at 3,150 yuan, and "Little Fairy" brand at 3,650 yuan, a decrease of about one or two hundred yuan compared to before. Transactions for Japanese cigarettes remain smooth, so market sentiment remains firm. "Gold Gun" brand is at 1,400 yuan, "Gold Building" brand is at 1,850 yuan, "Red Rose" brand is at 1,050 yuan, "Quan Lu" brand is at 1,550 yuan, "Nian Zhi Quan Lu" brand is at 1,570 yuan, "Guide" brand is at 1,300 yuan, national cigarettes "Gold Mouse" brand is at 1,500 yuan, "Beauty" brand is at 2,700 yuan, and "Pyramid" brand is at 3,000 yuan, all remaining stable.</p>
<p>Minimal Fluctuations in Daily Necessities</p>
<p>The daily necessities market has seen very few changes. For example, the allocation of soap is not strong, and although Xiangmao is allocating goods, each household only receives one box. Market sentiment is trending towards firmness. High-quality brands of matches have few inquiries, while sales of low-quality matches are still lively. Prices are stable. Gu Ben soap remains at 340 yuan, Huang Xiangmao soap at 215 yuan, and Bai Xiangmao soap at 255 yuan. However, the momentum of Scissor soap is increasing again, with a price of 290 yuan. Phoenix brand matches were at 2,750 yuan, with transactions, Beauty brand at 2,950 yuan, Gold Tripod brand at 2,600 yuan, and miscellaneous brands at 2,250 yuan. Yang candles, White Lees, are at 125 yuan, and miscellaneous brands are at 95 yuan, with prices but no market.</p>

<h3>The Responsibilities of a Couple</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Many people believe that after a man and woman marry, they become a couple and the protagonists of a family, but they soon forget their responsibilities.</p>
<p>In fact, the responsibilities and obligations of both men and women are very simple. George Bernard Shaw, in his play "Back to Methuselah," explained his definition, which we can see from the following dialogue:</p>
<p>Adam: I will always love Eve and no one else.</p>
<p>Eve: If Adam can keep his promise, I will love no one else but him.</p>
<p>Serpent: You two have invented marriage. His relationship with you and not with anyone else makes him your husband, and your relationship with him and not with anyone else makes you his wife?</p>
<p>I hope that those who are not yet married and those who are already married will always remember their responsibilities and obligations.</p>
<h3>Summer Drinks</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xun</p>
<p>Lotus Leaf Congee: Fresh lotus leaves are sold at vegetable stalls. Cook them with congee. It is fragrant and delicious when eaten, and it can stimulate the appetite. It is even better with fennel.</p>
<p>Jelly: Buy agar-agar at a southern goods store, add water and boil it until it is mushy. Let it congeal in cold water for an hour to form jelly. When eating, mix it with mint water (available at pharmacies) and white sugar (wheat flour is also acceptable). It is incredibly refreshing.</p>
<p>Tea Bean Soup: Soak tea beans until they are plump, and cook them with glutinous rice or gorgon fruit and Job’s tears. Add a little white sugar and mix with mint water when eating. It is exceptionally palatable.</p>
<p>Homemade Herbal Tea: Buy agastache rugosa at a pharmacy and brew it like tea daily, instead of tea leaves. Let it cool before drinking. It is refreshing and delicious, and it can also prevent epidemics.</p>
<h3>Health Exercise Method (6)</h3>
<p>Mr. Mai’s health exercise method, with formulas ten to nineteen as the second group, has been completed in this issue. From formula twenty onwards, we enter the last group, namely the third group. During practice, if you do not feel tired or exhausted from doing the first and second groups together, you can continue to do the third group. Otherwise, you should follow the step-by-step approach as mentioned in previous issues. It is better to progress gradually than to be impatient and greedy for more, or to only pick the easier or more interesting formulas, because each formula has its own function. You must practice them in order to achieve the desired effect.</p>
<p>For people who sit more and move less, the muscles and tendons in the lower back are easily affected. Also, there are many women who feel dissatisfied with the size of their buttocks and are eager to find ways to reduce them. The eighteenth formula published in this issue is the most effective exercise for them. When doing it, pay attention to extending the legs as far as possible forward and backward, and avoid touching the ground. The waist must also be kept absolutely balanced, and the upper body should not shake.</p>
<p>The nineteenth formula can increase the activity of the stomach, intestines, and kidneys by applying considerable pressure to them. Keep your upper body straight when doing it, and do not lower your chin towards your knees.</p>
<p>The twentieth formula can make the abdominal muscles and tendons better perform their function of protecting the organs. The muscles and tendons of the spine will have the opportunity to stretch, thereby increasing their strength. If it is difficult to straighten both knees when doing it, you can use a fixed frame, or tie a loop of leather or thick rope to the wall and put your toes into it.</p>
<p>(A80 and Figure 80) Lie on your side, with your right waist on the ground. Place your right hand on your left hip and extend your left leg back and forth. Keep your knees straight and your toes pointing down when extending. Repeat six times, counting each time the leg is extended backward as one repetition. Then turn over and lie on your side, with your left waist on the ground, and extend your right leg forward. Repeat six times as well.</p>
<p>(A90 and Figure 90) Lie on your side, with your right waist on the ground. Rest your head on your right hand and place your left hand on your left hip. Bring your left knee up towards your chin, with your toes pointing down. Repeat six times, counting each time the leg is straightened back to its original position as one repetition. Turn over and lie on your side, with your left waist on the ground, and bring your right knee up as well. Repeat six times (End of the second group).</p>
<p>(Figure 10) Lie flat on your back, clasp your hands behind your head, raise your upper body into a sitting position, and lean forward as far as possible. Return to the original position. Repeat six times, counting each time you return to the flat, original position as one repetition. Keep your knees straight and do not bend them when doing it.</p>
<h3>My Opinion on Uncle Ding Zhonghu Not Celebrating His Birthday</h3>
<p>— Wang Ying</p>
<p>Ying’s family has lived in Wuxi for generations. In October of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), we fled to Changsha due to the war. Later, we went to Hong Kong, and from Hong Kong, we eventually arrived in Shanghai. We were taken in by my uncle, Ding Zhonghu, and my mother and I lived with him. Amidst the rising cost of living, it has now been five years. During these five years, I have seen my uncle write various books. Among Confucian books, "Shaonian Jinde Lu" (Records of Moral Progress for Youth) is the best. Among health and longevity books, "Weisheng Shu Shisi Zhong" (Fourteen Kinds of Health Books) is the best. Among mathematics books, "Suanxue Shumu Tiyao" (Abstracts of Mathematical Books) is the best. Among elementary school books, "Shuowen Jiezi Gulin" (Shuowen Jiezi Annotated Forest) and its supplements are the best. Among numismatic books, "Guquan Dacidian" (Dictionary of Ancient Coins) and "Lidai Guquan Tushuo" (Illustrated Explanations of Ancient Coins Throughout History) are the best. Among Buddhist books, "Foxue Dacidian" (Dictionary of Buddhism) and "Liuzu Tan Jing Jianzhu" (Annotated Commentary on the Sixth Patriarch's Platform Sutra) are the best. Among medical books, "Jinshi Neike Quanshu" (Complete Book of Modern Internal Medicine) and "Xin Bencao Gangmu" (New Compendium of Materia Medica) are the best. Among Taoist books, "Jingzuo Fa Jingyi" (The Essence of Meditation), "Laozi Daodejing Jianzhu" (Annotated Commentary on Laozi's Daodejing), and "Daozang Jinghua Lu Yibai Zhong" (One Hundred Selections from the Taoist Canon) are the best. In addition, there are "Erya Gulin" (Erya Annotated Forest), "Qunya Gulin" (Qunya Annotated Forest), "Shiming Gulin" (Shiming Annotated Forest), "Fangyan Gulin" (Fangyan Annotated Forest), and "Shuowen Gu Jianbian" (Shuowen Annotated Abridged Compilation), etc., which have not yet been published. Mr. Li Shenyan once said, "Mr. Ding is a person who transmits knowledge for a thousand years. Just the merit of publishing these books and treating people with respect is unmatched. If you were to search throughout the twenty-eight provinces of China for someone comparable to Mr. Ding, you would probably not find anyone." Observing the abundance of Mr. Ding's publications, Mr. Li's words are certainly not an exaggeration. My uncle usually eats the same food as the family, without adding special delicacies. Although my cousin Hui Kang often provides delicious food, he always shares it with the family. His clothes are also very simple. He gets up at 6:00 AM every morning to read, study, and write, without a moment of leisure. Last month, various circles in Shanghai initiated a commemoration of my uncle's 69th birthday, but he did not celebrate it. Various newspapers also praised him greatly. I cut out these articles and pasted them in a blank notebook. When my uncle saw it, he thought that the praise from the outside world was excessive, and he felt uneasy. So, he picked up a pen and wrote on it, "People in society, praise you too highly. Falling from high places may lead to death. You should examine yourself; do you have the morality and knowledge that are being attributed to you? If your reputation exceeds your reality, heaven will punish you, reduce your blessings, and shorten your lifespan. I am afraid of this. I have not been able to reduce my faults. You are in danger!" I record this to show my uncle's strict self-discipline and his dissatisfaction with himself. In the past, Ju Boyu, at the age of fifty, realized the errors of his previous forty-nine years. Now, my uncle, at the age of seventy, still says that he has not been able to reduce his faults. Then, is my uncle's decision not to celebrate his birthday because he believes he has nothing to celebrate, and is there an intention to emulate Boyu's awareness of his past errors?</p>
<p>Mr. Ding Fubao's lifelong advocacy of not celebrating birthdays truly contains a profound meaning of promoting world's well-being by extending one's life. This time, he donated all the money he received for his birthday to the newspaper's scholarship fund and the Shanghai Children's Welfare Home. This is a great kindness to poor students and orphaned children, and it will also greatly help promote the welfare of the entire society. Tomorrow is the actual day of Mr. Ding's 69th birthday. This publication respectfully wishes this old man good health, and that he remains vigorous in his old age.</p>
<h3>Jialuyanlu by Chouyin Jushi (Record of Wise Sayings)</h3>
<p>— Tao</p>
<p>Mr. Ding Fubao is highly respected for his age and virtue. His words and actions are a model for young people. The following recorded sayings are Mr. Ding's wise words, which can be used as our mottos. Chouyin Jushi is Mr. Ding's pseudonym. ——Editor——</p>
<p>Although fate is fixed, it can be transformed through human effort, such as transforming the weak into the strong, transforming the sick into the healthy, transforming the short-lived into the long-lived, and transforming frustrating circumstances into smooth sailing. This is what is meant by seizing control of one's fate.</p>
<p>Those who fail encounter obstacles everywhere, while those who succeed encounter prosperity everywhere. Now, if you want to transform failure into success, you must transform laziness into diligence, extravagance into thrift, arrogance into humility, hypocrisy into honesty, cowardice into courage, jealousy into helpfulness, cruelty into compassion, hesitation into agility, recklessness into prudence, impatience into patience, and pessimism into optimism. Over time, not only will your mind and body be transformed, but your fate will also be transformed.</p>
<p>Those who spend half their lives in the pursuit of fame and fortune cannot be said to have a meaningful life. However, abandoning fame and profit and retreating into the mountains is also not a meaningful life. These are people of weak will who cannot withstand the competition of life.</p>
<p>To have feet that can walk, hands that can grasp, eyes that can see, ears that can hear, a mouth that can eat and speak, and a mind that can judge, understand, think, and create is to have human vitality. Where there is this vitality, there is life. Where there is no vitality, there is a tomb. Since people have innate vitality, they should invigorate their spirits and strive for self-improvement.</p>
<p>People naturally cannot be without activity, but activities that harm others are moral and legal crimes, and there is absolutely no justification for them. Activities that are solely for private gain and desires are the actions of petty people, and no matter how vigorous they are, they are not worthy of praise. A society is a collection of many people who are interconnected. People should not only be aware of themselves but should also strive for the general welfare of society. This is the obligation of forming a society. There is no other purpose in life than this. To do your best for society, to do your best for humanity, and to do your best for your country is to be a useful person, a person who best understands the meaning of life, a person who is most active, and a person who best fulfills his or her responsibilities in life.</p>
<p>Before criticizing others, you must first think about how many flaws you have. If you have not corrected them, how can you have time to criticize others?</p>
<p>Books are good friends in solitude, guides for those who are lost, and companions for those who are helpless. If you immerse yourself in them, they can make the hungry forget their hunger, the cold forget their cold, the sick forget their pain, the poor forget their poverty, and the worried forget their anxiety. They can also increase one's lifespan, broaden one's knowledge and learning, and make one's spirit happy.</p>
<p>When doing things, you should be steadfast, persevering, courageous, and resolute. In the midst of a thousand hardships and obstacles, you must not utter a single word of difficulty. The more difficult and dangerous it is, the more determined you must be to overcome it with your spirit, to defeat these demons, and to achieve your goals.</p>
<h3>One Thing About Housekeeping</h3>
<p>— Hen Xin</p>
<p>Using wine (or alcohol) instead of water to grind ink can prevent the problem of bad smells in summer and freezing in winter.</p>
<p>Singe the tip of a newly purchased fountain pen slightly over a fire to make it easier to absorb ink.</p>
<p>Oiled paper does not absorb ink, so it cannot be written on. However, if you mix soap water with the ink, it will be the same as writing on white paper.</p>
<p>When drying books, paintings, scrolls, and albums, avoid exposing them to the hot sun to prevent them from becoming uneven, damaged, or cracked. (Donated to Help Raise Funds)</p>
<h3>Vitamins in Fruits and Vegetables</h3>
<p>Among the various fruits available for purchase here, several contain a lot of vitamins. For example, apples contain vitamins A, B, C, and F; apricots contain vitamins A, C, and F; peaches contain vitamins A, B, and C; and tomatoes contain vitamins A, B, C, and F.</p>
<p>Among various gourds, winter melon contains vitamin B, cucumber contains vitamins A, B, and C, loofah contains vitamins A, B, and F, and pumpkin contains vitamins A and B. However, watermelon and cantaloupe do not contain vitamins.</p>
<h3>Wooden Clogs</h3>
<p>— Gu Tianyi</p>
<p>Summer slippers are like undershirts, almost everyone needs a pair. It's much easier and cooler to wear them around the house than shoes.</p>
<p>However, in these times of expensive goods, a pair of leather slippers can cost thirty or forty yuan. Let's take a pair of embroidered slippers as an example; even without counting the embroidered surface, just getting a pair of soles can cost twenty yuan. Of course, the most suitable slippers for ordinary people are wooden clogs.</p>
<p>Speaking of wooden clogs, Guangdong products are the best and deserve to be called "top-notch." Wearing them barefoot is as comfortable as wearing slippers, and they also have painted designs, making them not only comfortable but also beautiful. Comparing them with the rough and unsophisticated Shanghai native products is like comparing heaven and earth.</p>
<p>These Guangdong wooden clogs are not only cheaper than slippers, but if your feet get dirty, you can just put them under the tap to wash, which is more convenient than wearing slippers.</p>
<p>If you think wearing these "clack-clack" wooden clogs is too crude, then you are wrong. At this time, the only thing that matters is economic practicality. Moreover, some people are even advocating bare chests, exposing natural beauty!</p>

<h3>A Week's Family Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>The temperature has exceeded 100 degrees Fahrenheit for several consecutive days. This heat is unprecedented in the last twenty-four years, and the threat of epidemic diseases is increasing day by day. Special precautions must be taken regarding food. In the past, General Wu Peifu advocated three "no's" in his life, which were widely circulated. I believe that for the "food" of the hot summer days, we should also uphold three "no's": 1. Don't eat too much. 2. Don't eat too greasy food. 3. Don't eat carelessly. Because eating too much or too greasy food is difficult for the stomach to digest. A cold can easily lead to epidemics. Everyone knows this. What does it mean to eat carelessly? It means that you should carefully examine the food you eat. Do not eat leftovers that have been stored overnight and have a sour taste. Dishes must be cooked thoroughly. Do not eat things that are half-cooked, and do not eat cold dishes at banquets carelessly. Also, do not eat things that are not covered, because they may have been touched by flies. If we can always uphold these three small "no's" regarding food, then epidemic demons will naturally flee in fear.</p>
<p>Monday: Stir-fried shredded pork with green peppers, sweet and sour yellow croaker, stir-fried bean curd sheets, stir-fried green vegetables, stir-fried long cowpeas</p>
<p>Tuesday: Onion-fried steak, steamed dried fish, stir-fried alfalfa, braised eggplant with sweet sauce</p>
<p>Wednesday: Stuffed old cucumber, stir-fried dried scallops with eggs, braised loofah with tofu, snow cabbage and mung bean sprouts</p>
<p>Thursday: Tomato beef soup, braised salted anchovies with tofu, braised winter melon slices, scallion oil shredded radish</p>
<p>Friday: Braised dried vegetables with pork, steamed fermented carp, vegetarian tofu soup, batter-fried edamame, batter-fried edamame pods</p>
<p>Saturday: Curry chicken cubes, stir-fried crab roe with chives, braised vegetarian ten-delicacy, mashed daylily with tofu</p>
<p>Sunday: Duck giblet soup, stir-fried eel paste, stir-fried flat beans, stir-fried green vegetables</p>
<p>Tianchu Recipe (112)</p>
<h3>(202) Scallion Oil Noodles with Potato Pancakes</h3>
<p>Ingredients: Flour, potatoes, lard, scallions, salt, monosodium glutamate (MSG), poultry or baby bok choy, sugar, vegetable oil</p>
<p>Instructions: First, cook the potatoes until tender, peel, and mash them into a paste. Then, add a thick batter made from flour. The amounts of both should be about equal. Next, add an appropriate amount of chopped scallions, MSG, and salt (or sugar if you prefer sweet). Mix everything together thoroughly. Then, take a spoonful at a time and put it into a hot pan coated with oil. Quickly use a spatula to shape it into a round pancake. Place several small pieces of diced lard in the middle (or vegetable scraps if you are vegetarian). Add another spoonful of potato and flour batter on top and use the spatula to flatten it into a round pancake. Fry repeatedly until both sides are slightly browned. This food is inexpensive and easy to make. Eating it often will not cause indigestion. It is truly an economical, nutritious, and delicious food for families. If you have a large appetite, you can add a little thin porridge.</p>
<h3>(203) Hibiscus Cake</h3>
<p>— Draft by Shen Jianzhi</p>
<p>Ingredients: Flour, crab, pickled mustard tuber, salt, MSG, oil, soy sauce</p>
<p>Instructions: First, boil the small crabs until cooked, remove the meat and soak it in soy sauce. Next, dice the pickled mustard tuber into fine pieces. Then, use water to make a thick batter from flour, and mix in the crab meat and pickled mustard tuber pieces. Add an appropriate amount of salt and MSG and mix everything together thoroughly. Then, make them into round cakes of any size. Finally, deep-fry them in boiling oil until they are golden brown. They will have a unique flavor. Recently, flour has been rationed and distributed according to the number of people in the household, and small crabs are cheap in the market, so using crab meat is truly killing two birds with one stone.</p>
<p>Introduction: "MSG," "Wei Zong" (Flavor Essence), "Tianchu Soy Sauce Essence," and "Tianchu Household Water Chestnut Powder" produced by Tianchu MSG Factory are all available for sale at major companies and southern goods and food stores in the city.</p>
