<p>倫敦廿九日哈瓦斯電下議院通過信任政府案之前、邱吉爾首相曾答覆間話稱、「柔佛巴口、與新加坡之命運如何、此際殆難逆料、但可向下議院諸君保證者、即英國生力軍及飛機、現正源源開往增援是也、關於我國戰鬥艦「威爾斯親王」號與「却敵」號兩艘被日機擊沉事、我國派遣此兩戰鬥艦前往遠東、乃在「希望藉此能使日本置身戰爭之外、至少可使日軍總司令部不敢派遣商船隊駛往選灣、美國有事於夏威夷、無暇他顧、當時並無美國戰鬥艦「威爾斯親王」號實爲當時能駛抵該處應付大局之唯一的戰鬥艦」、以言遠東戰爭一般情形、余對於「一般的軍略佈置」、願負全責、但非負責軍官凟職不究之謂、吾人固巳犯嚴重錯誤、但認爲此種弱點、爲英美兩國因在太平洋暫時喪失海上霸權而致挫折之理由、尤爲謊謬、即在珍珠港事件之前、因日軍開入越南並在該處設立極有價値之根據地之故、英國成功之機會大爲减少、我國倘若不在尼羅河流域及其他地帶作戰、則必能應付日木一旦侵入越南、但英國不能單獨與德義日三國作戰、雖與美國澳洲聯邦　紐西蘭自治領、在新加坡舉行參謀部會議、保持有價値之接觸、但對於局勢之發展、「深爲焦慮、」我國之議會制度、最爲完善、當今之世、實無一國之戰時政府、能參加辯論接受各方面之批評、下議院之職責、其主要工作、乃在產生一有效之行政機關、此次下院辯論、余得益匪淺、對於各方所發表之意見、甚至爲反對內閣方面所提出者、余亦將加以攷慮、以言英美兩國同盟、兩國所有資源、現已集中於一處、共同使用、此外關於北菲洲里比亞戰事、茲有一點、殆可斷言者、即里比亞戰爭、似可造成第二戰綫、俾使德軍不能進攻高加索邦、「無論如何、自此尼羅河流域、可以高枕無憂矣、要之、我國在里比亞所採取之攻勢、雖不若東綫戰爭之重要、但此舉巳逼令敵軍在此危急之秋、不得不自東綫調回大批空軍」云、</p>

<h3>糧荒時代　可以充飢的植物</h3>
<p>雷士德醫學研究院教授李特著</p>
<p>十五世紀之初，中國有「救荒本草』書，載述糧荒時可以充飢的植物共四百十四種，其中不少是泰西書本中引爲有營養價値的。這些植物，分爲草·木·穀·果·菜五類，救荒本草所載每種植物，都有木刻示明。當時歐洲尙不知有刻木術，這些木刻雖較日後的歐洲木刻高明得多，但無科學性質的詳細叙述，且植物的葉，刻劃不明，所以有多種植物，不可確辨，餘者却刻得淸淸楚楚，有其名稱和叙述，不致有誤。</p>
<p>茲將辯認確定的各類植物，擇錄如下：</p>
<p>草　（甲）葉與莖車前子，旋覆花，金盞子，野粉團兒，金針菜（黃花菜），茴香，鴨跖草，小桃紅（鳳），（乙）根　百合，麥門冬，沙參，菖蒲，（丙）子與果　回回米，槮子，疾藜子，鷄冠果，（丁）葉與芽　羊蹄苗，姑娘菜，蒼耳，土茜苗，王不留行，（戊）根與葉尖　牛旁子，蒲笋，杏葉沙參，蔖笋，（己）莖水慈菰，　笋，荇絲菜。</p>
<p>木　（甲）葉夜合樹，木槿樹，白楊樹，椿樹芽，（乙）果　酸棗樹，金銀花，山裏果兒，（丙）葉與果　枸杞，椿桃樹，柏樹，柘樹，（丁）花　藤花菜，槐樹芽，秋樹，（戊）花，葉與果棠梨樹，文冠花，（己）葉，皮與果　桑椹樹，楡錢樹。</p>
<p>穀與有關之屬嫩葉與子喬麥苗，胡麻，　豆，蠶豆，蘇子苗。</p>
<p>家果與塊莖　（甲）果水菱角，軟棗，野匍萄，野櫻桃，（乙）果與葉石榴，杏樹，棗樹，桃子，（丙）莖毛芋艿，　薺，（丁）莖與子　薿。</p>
<p>菜　（甲）葉，莧菜，馬齒莧菜，白甜菜，蓬花花，冬葵菜，蓼芽菜，草頭，荊芥，遏籃菜，孛孛丁菜，（乙）莖，甘露根，（丙）莖與葉野葱，（丁）葉與果薺菜，紫蘇，灰菜，（戊）莖與子山藥。</p>
<p>上述者和其他植物，共有四百十四種，可見任何植物如味不甚惡，都可食用，其數當然很多。但也有食用過限，有害身體的，如連翹葉含糖原質，酸模猶如大黃葉，含蓚酸鹽，有害腎臟，且使小便帶血，橡實則能引起劇烈的痢疾。近年油頭區的無知民衆，以參茨薾磨粉充飢，參茨　原來有毒質，因之中毒入醫院的，頗不乏人。</p>
<p>在這篇短文內，尙可對現已發芽或迅將發芽的則種植物、作稍詳的叙述。</p>
<p>蒲公英　是極普通的蔬菜，亙古以來向為全球人類食用，可以自植，逢春採集，葉大而嫩，略有苦味，以含蛋白質和礦鹽著稱，其所含燐與灰質，勝於菠菜，金盞子，或萵苣，其鎂質亦勝於萵苣與捲心菜，且含重要金屬如鐵，銅，錳與鋅，而富於維他命丙。</p>
<p>薺菜野菜　市有售，味美略辛，其基本的化學成分與蒲公英相同，所含維他命甲與乙一之量相同，鐵質與維他命丙則更多，且富於鐵，灰和其他礦質。</p>
<p>車前子　是遍生世上的雜草，『救荒本草』稱之爲甘美而無毒的蔬菜，採其嫩芽，加油鹽煮之可果腹，花穗結子時所含維他命乙一極豐富。</p>
<p>鴨跖草又名竹葉菜，嫩芽可充食物，開藍花便轉老。關於其他多種植物，如馬齒莧和藜，他國人民也喜食用。家藜有幾種，常令時市上有售。事實上，各種植物無論野生或家植，如可食用，華人罕有不食的。</p>

<h3>「日光節約」的意義</h3>
<p>— 金毅</p>
<p>本年度的「日光節約」將提早於今日午夜起實行，雖然天寒歲暮，那鵝黃絨似的陽光還不能引起人們的注意；但是晚上的霓虹燈歛跡以後，白天終究比晚上討人喜歡。</p>
<p>「日光節約」不過是把鐘點撥快一小時，在每天工作數小時而然後能獲得酬報的人們本來是沒有多大關係的，譬如九五的寫字間，除去十二至二時的休息外，是十足六小時工作。上午提早一小時上寫字間，下午亦提早一小時散寫字間，即使限止電流，寫字間里的電燈在工作時間還是不能减省的。但這運動實行以來，收效據說頗爲宏大，所以本年度又較去年度更提早實行了。</p>
<p>自電車提早進廠，娛樂塲提早打烊又加路刦者的「刺激」，現在，的上海人已經被迫改善了他們過去的「沒有太陽的生活」了。——表面也似乎頗爲接近這一運動的。但早起早眠，祇改善了生活的習慣，而沒有增加生活的意義，譬如早起之後而上茶室去品茗談心，這又與晚上在咖啡室里撩天有什麼分別呢？所以「日光節約」運動在現在應該擴大它的意義，「日光節約」之後，更應「利用日光」，換句話說，亦即是「增加生產」，否則，僅僅提早一小時，還是半斤與八兩的換個名稱而已。</p>
<h3>舞臺与銀幕</h3>

<p>李萍淸新作「貴婦風流」聞係「香箋淚」所改編。</p>

<p>修養漫譚</p>
<h3>看聽做</h3>
<p>— 鴨溪譯</p>
<p>本文作者M．F．Burlingame爲美國名敎育家，此篇譯自氏之演講集中，原文甚長，下文僅是節譯而已。</p>
<p>—譯者按</p>
<p>靑年們，我衷心地希望你們，絕不要忘記了「自修」的意義。學校，書店，和敎師，僅不過是幫助而已，眞眞的敎育，還得在於你自己的努力。堅決不斷的勤勉的學習，能够完成很好的自我敎育。</p>
<p>敎育有兩個目標：第一，發展自我；第二，求得智識。前者的意思，就是激勵和培養你的人格，增進你的記憶力與理解力，使你在這人生的歷程中，學得比以前更合理的生活方式。至於後者，則是學習把握事物本質的方法的意思。</p>
<p>以自修的方式去求知，大概有四個來源：　從觀察中得來。　從經騐中得來。　從談話中得來。　從學習中得來。你如果從這四方面努力地做去，那末，雖然沒有了師長與學校，仍能滿足你的求知慾。</p>
<p>譬如說吧，當你在田野或森林裏散步的時候，你可以見到很多的動物，鳥雀及昆蟲。不要傷害和侵擾它們，你當默默地觀察他們的生活習慣，它們怎樣食物，怎樣行路，更可從聽覺與視覺中去辨別他們的種類。</p>
<p>一個著名的自然科學家如此說過：「我之所以有今日的成功，完全是由於我的觀察事物的精細。」效法他吧！—精細的觀察！那你也可能成爲一個著名的自然科學家的。</p>
<p>我常常感覺到，野外旅行是最好的一個學習機會。因爲藉此你可以更能與大自然接近，更能認識大自然。老實說，大自然簡直是一所最優良的大學校，世界上沒有一所學校能比它更偉大，更廣闊，課目更繁多，標本更豐富，實騐更便利。你用不着到加力福尼亞，或者到南美，到北極圈，去尋覓新奇的材料，在大自然界裏到處都多着你「見所未見，聞所未聞」的事物，等待着你去硏究，觀察，學習。</p>
<p>當你有機會參觀一所工廠的時候，你就應該細細的觀察機械的配置，你要硏究而且思考，如何從一個定點發出力量，轉動　桿以及輪盤，就能產生出巨大無比的力量，這是什麼緣故？要澈底的探究出緣因與結果，這才是眞眞的治學者的精神。</p>
<p>從談話中，也能得到很多你所需要的知識。無論遇着什麽人，一有談話的機會，你就該請求他吿訴你他所最熟悉的事物。</p>
<p>一個博學的人被人問道：</p>
<p>「你是怎樣求得道許多學問的？」</p>
<p>他答道：「我從每一個人的談話中得來。」</p>
<p>最後，願諸君記牢：你們要使自己成功，便當閱讀，學習，觀察，思考，硏究，推論，沈思，永遠地不斷地看，聽，做。至於進學校與否，那倒在所不計。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十七　歸宿</p>
<p>「不錯，都是他！所以咱們出去得遲，回來得反早了。」韓老頭兒一路說，一路還偷瞧秋海棠的臉色，因此忙又急不及待的追加說明。「可是天地良心，那位大少爺從來沒有囉唣過，我女兒也是看見的。要是我騙了你，我就是老亡八！」</p>
<p>秋海棠倒被他逗得笑起來了。</p>
<p>「而且，三哥，他每次付錢總是先交給我，或交給我女兒。問出來的話也總是正經的多。憑他這樣斯文，你們梅寳姑娘還放心不下，這幾天一定要把我女兒牽了一起去。這件事，三哥，我眞要佩服你！」韓老頭兒說到這裏，不由習慣地　翹起了一條大姆指來。「聽你說，從前也是唱戲出身，不料你的家敎竟這樣的好，而你家梅寳姑娘又是如此聽話，眞敎人羨慕！」</p>
<p>韓老頭兒這麼一說，秋海棠的心裏才高興了些，臉上的不快的神色也消去了一大半。</p>
<p>「這……就是……是你所說……說……的喜事嗎？」</p>
<p>韓家姑娘禁不住又哈哈地笑起來了</p>
<p>「我的話還沒有完咧！」韓老頭兒忙着向他女兒使了一個眼色，自己也把態度變得格外莊重起來。「咱們現在是差不多同弟兄一樣了，你今兒旣然把這件事問我，我就不能不把所知道的一齊吿訴你！要說那位大少爺的人品，可真是再端正沒有，心地又熱；可是話又得說回來，無論他人品怎樣端正，心地怎樣熱，假使不打什麽主意的話，他對咱們也決不會這樣好。三哥，你是明白人，我當然不能騙你，看他那個樣子，委實是在第一次上就把梅寳看中的，不過……」（三二〇）</p>
<h3>薄暮的貝當路</h3>
<p>— 蕪喊</p>
<p>懷着一顆空虛的心，和友人漫步到貝常路。這正是夕陽西下，新月未上的黃昏時候。貝常路上暮色倉皇，行人稀少，顯現着一天將結束時由凌亂而入於靜寞的模樣。</p>
<p>漸漸地黑下來了，伸手巳見不到五指，那幾宅矗立着的偉大公寓—譬如　Georgia之類—好樣古廟裏的大鐘，很沉着而穩定的被稀薄的夜之幕蒙起來，微黃的燈光，從十　樓以上的玻璃窗中射出來，初初是疏散的幾只燈在那里放光，不上六七分鐘，幾乎在大半的黑窗框裏都變成了光明的琉璃世界了。</p>
<p>我們走到西區沙利文門口，從靠街的大玻璃窗中望進去，看見擺着些桌子椅子，還有靠小食櫃台旁邊的一排高圓櫈，裏面連女夥計在內，一共祇有五個人，兩個女郞高坐櫃旁，一對男女在「池子」裏啜茗，他們都是洋人，亦不足怪。</p>
<p>寫到這里不免來一個插曲：</p>
<p>據一位朋友吿訴我，沙利文花旗式麪包現在賣一元二角一隻，而且潔白細軟，比之市上那些半生不熟，不是烘得過火，便是焙得不够的「雜色」麪包不知要高到幾倍。不過因爲祇限早晨賣，而且供應的量不多，沙利文當局對於那些麪包主顧現在已發有一種「卡」，憑卡購包，一些不能通融。</p>
<p>我想起那朋友的話，再看看我們所站在的地方，未免憧憬着早晨來憑卡購包的幸福者。看了一會沿着人行道朝南走，徐匯變塔尖因爲厚厚的夜幕垂着，已沒有踪蹤可尋，祇看見七八輛的脚踏車，首啣尾的一字兒衝破着黑暗過來，車尾一盞小燈照在地面上，那薄弱的光綫慢慢地隨着鈴聲過去，雖然覺得很卑謙的樣子，但是在這個時代中，這個「夜」的環境中，倒是不能小覷它們呢。</p>
<h3>蛇與馬</h3>
<p>— 海南</p>
<p>照陰曆計算，今年始辛已年，明年是壬午年，現在已屆蛇尾馬頭之時。據一般人預測，今年是蛇年，所以一字長蛇陣當令，買四元三角三升的洋米要擺一字長蛇陣，買九角五分一斤的平麵，領回鄕通行證也要排隊，甚致銀行裹拿存款也要排一字長蛇陣，長蛇可算出足風頭；因此有人預測到明年馬年，一定是上海市民大開馬（碼）頭，因爲市面的不景氣同生活程度的日益增高，今年關內必有大批商店停業，大　職業靑年勢必被迫解職，不得不大開其碼頭回家鄕也</p>

<h3>War Trends Towards Johor Strait, Johor Bahru to be the Decisive Battlefield, Japanese Troops Advance on Singapore in Three Routes</h3>
<p>Malaya, 28th, Allied Telegraph - Japanese troops in the central part of the Malay Peninsula occupied Kulai this afternoon, 18 miles from Singapore. Those Japanese troops suddenly turned northeast and joined forces with the east coast Japanese troops at 5:30 this afternoon, heading south.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 30th, Huitong News Agency - According to a Singapore dispatch published in the London Times, the sound of Japanese artillery fire has been heard in Johor Bahru at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula. Japanese troops are bombarding British transportation lines. Japanese troops are attacking Singapore in three routes, aiming for a decisive battle in Johor Bahru. The eastern route of Japanese troops has reached the Sudiely Highway, the central route is advancing along the Kulai Highway, and the western route of Japanese troops is advancing towards Pontian Basong.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 30th, Allied News Agency - The Japanese army's advance on Singapore continues to make progress today. They have crossed Apit Apit on the west coast (about 20 miles from Johor Bahru) and Kulai (the fourth railway station, 18 miles from the Johor Causeway). After occupying Apit Apit, the Japanese army has controlled the entire Strait of Malacca. After the Japanese army, advancing south in central Johor, occupied Kulai, they are now advancing rapidly towards Singapore along the highway parallel to the railway, while clearing out the remnants of Australian troops resisting along the central Johor railway. The Japanese army on the east coast of Malaya is now no more than 35 miles from Singapore. It is reported that after one route of the Japanese army on the central front occupied Kulai, it suddenly turned northeast to join forces with the Japanese troops who landed and advanced south on the east coast of Enlau, crushing the Australian troops north of Gemas.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 30th, Huitong News Agency - According to news from the Malayan front, the vanguard of the Japanese army reached Lao Xiang, 50 kilometers northwest of the Johor Strait, last night.</p>
<p>Malaya Front, 30th, Allied Telegraph - Japanese bombers attacked the Singapore airfield yesterday, encountering only fierce anti-aircraft fire and no enemy aircraft to intercept. The Japanese aircraft were very successful in their bombing.</p>
<p>Singapore, 30th, Reuters - During the Japanese air raid on Singapore on Wednesday, some people were killed and wounded. An air raid alarm was issued here yesterday morning, and Japanese naval bombers attacked. Allied fighter planes took off to respond.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 30th, Huitong News Agency - It was revealed here last night that, according to enemy prisoners, the British army originally planned to fiercely resist the Japanese army's southward advance 60 miles north of Singapore on the Malay Peninsula. The defending forces on this line were mainly Indian troops, who were unable to stop the Japanese army's advance. Many also fled the battle. From January 23, the main force composed purely of British troops began to arrive, but it was difficult to reverse the declining trend.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 30th, Huitong News Agency - It has been 50 days since the Japanese army landed on the Malay Peninsula. During this period, they have occupied a total of 900 kilometers of land. Japanese engineers have built 200 bridges in these 50 days, greatly assisting the Japanese army's advance. The Japanese army has encountered even greater difficulties in southern Malaya, especially in Johor, where many bridges and roads have been destroyed. Ultimately, the construction by the engineers allowed the army to advance without any delay.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 30th, Huitong News Agency - The Imperial General Headquarters announced last night that Japanese naval aircraft shot down a total of 45 enemy aircraft in the South Seas area on January 26 and 27. The Japanese Special Naval Landing Force completely occupied Kendari on the southeast coast of Celebes on January 26.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 30th, Allied News Agency - The naval authorities have firmly denied the recent American report that 30 Japanese ships were sunk or damaged and more than 20,000 Japanese soldiers were killed when the Japanese army landed in the Makassar Strait last week. It is claimed that, to date, the Japanese side's losses in that area have only been the sinking of four transport ships, and almost all of the Japanese soldiers on board were rescued and are now participating in land battles.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 30th, Huitong News Agency - According to Australian officers captured by the Japanese army in Johor, there are currently less than 15,000 British and Australian troops remaining in Singapore. The Japanese army is now rapidly advancing towards Singapore, so the defending forces there are extremely panicked. Most of the women and children there have probably been evacuated to Australia.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 30th, Huitong News Agency - According to news from the Malayan front, the Sultan of Johor, Ibrahim, has suddenly disappeared, causing great distress to his family. Captain Amuha, the Sultan's attendant, told an Asahi Shimbun reporter that he could not explain the Sultan's whereabouts. The Sultan had a good impression of Japan, so he allowed large amounts of Japanese capital to be invested in Johor. It is known that the Sultan has recently been monitored by British police or is still being detained by the British.</p>
<p>Singapore, 30th, Reuters - Starting today, Singapore will implement a curfew from 9:00 PM to 5:00 AM the following morning. However, this ban will not apply whenever there is an air raid alarm until ten minutes after the alarm is lifted.</p>
<p>Dutch Forces Continue to Fight in Borneo</p>
<p>Batavia, 30th, Reuters - After the Japanese army landed in Bangka in northwestern Dutch Borneo and occupied Kuching (the capital of British Borneo's Sarawak), their advance on Pontianak, the capital 90 miles to the south, was expected. According to people here, the Dutch side has never kept secret the difficulty of defending Borneo. The size of the army required to provide adequate defense for the island far exceeded its strategic value. No detailed reports have been received regarding the situation in Pontianak, but it is known that the Dutch forces in the area are currently resisting.</p>
<p>Batavia, 30th, Reuters - Today's official gazette stated that Japanese aircraft continued to be active over several parts of the peninsula, especially reconnaissance. Bombs fell in various places, causing material damage but no loss of life. News has recently been received from Minahasa in northeastern Celebes, indicating that Dutch guerrillas are still fighting. No details of casualties have been reported. No further reports have been received from Pontianak (the capital of Dutch Borneo) and Kendari (southeastern Celebes).</p>
<p>Tokyo, 30th, Allied News Agency - Industrial experts stated today that after the Japanese army occupied oil wells in Sarawak and Brunei in Borneo, they can obtain more than 3 million tons of oil annually. The Miri oil wells in Sarawak have been the oil source for the British Far East Fleet for 30 years, demonstrating its importance. Japanese oil industry experts have arrived in Borneo to repair the damaged oil wells and are expected to begin extracting oil this summer.</p>
<p>Singapore, 30th, Reuters - According to a communiqué issued here today, fierce fighting is taking place in the central sector of the Malayan front. There are no changes to report in the eastern sector of the front. In the central sector, the Eighth Army engaged with the Japanese army near Kulai. There was fierce fighting in the Bukit Timah area yesterday, and the Japanese continued to be active, attacking British forward positions and transportation lines. There was little fighting in the Pontian Besar area in the western sector of the front.</p>
<p>London, 30th, Havas - Those responsible announced today that the Japanese army in Malaya has reached Kulai, less than 30 kilometers from Singapore Island.</p>
<p>Batavia, 30th, Havas - The Dutch East Indies High Command announced this morning that fierce fighting is still taking place in Balikpapan and Minahasa. The Japanese air force is very active in that area. According to a telegram from Balikpapan, fighting is taking place in and around the city.</p>
<p>London, 30th, Reuters - London officials stated today that the Japanese army is advancing towards the causeway connecting Johor Bahru and Singapore Island. The closest they have reached is Kulai, about 18 miles (29 kilometers) away.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops in Burma Reach the East Bank of the Salween River</p>
<p>Tokyo, 30th, Huitong News Agency - The Japanese Imperial General Headquarters announced yesterday that the Japanese air force has gained complete air supremacy over the seas around Celebes and the western and southern faces of the Moluccas Islands. At the same time, Japanese troops advancing towards Moulmein in Burma have now reached the east bank of the Salween River and are still engaged in fierce fighting.</p>
<p>Burma Front, 30th, Allied News Agency - Japanese bombers heavily bombed the Rangoon airfield at 5:00 PM yesterday. Twenty British aircraft took off to intercept, and five were shot down.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 30th, Reuters - A joint British army and air force communiqué issued today stated that fighting is currently taking place east and south of Moulmein. There is nothing to report in the Rangoon area. One British air force aircraft did not return from a sortie.</p>
<h3>Street Scene of Singapore</h3>
<p>Singapore is a prosperous commercial center, densely populated, and the only major port in the Nanyang Islands. The city's roads and streets are wide and can be considered first-class in the Far East. Because there are so many overseas Chinese there, the street scenes are very Chinese in character. Taking a tour of the city, it is as if one is in Guangzhou, with posters in Mandarin, Japanese, and English (top picture). Ninety percent of the people seen on the streets are overseas Chinese. The police directing traffic in the city are also very special. In addition to their uniforms, they all carry a rattan shield on their backs, as if they have added wings to their bodies. This rattan shield is used instead of a traffic baton. People who come to Singapore for the first time cannot help but notice and find this kind of traffic police (bottom picture) a very strange outfit.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in Batangas, Philippines</h3>
<p>According to the British Broadcasting Corporation, London, 29th, Washington Gazette, Japanese infantry launched a fierce attack yesterday on the positions of American troops commanded by MacArthur in the Batangas Peninsula, Philippines. They were driven back by heavy American artillery fire.</p>
<h3>Australian Troops in Rabaul Implement Scorched Earth Policy</h3>
<p>Brisbane, 29th, Reuters - According to returning Australian air force personnel, the Australian army implemented a scorched earth policy when withdrawing from Rabaul. All airfields and buildings were destroyed by explosives, and gasoline depots were blown up. Even secondary airfields near Rabaul were also destroyed. The Australian Air Force believes that the defending forces near Rabaul can still hold out for several weeks. The area is forested with few roads, allowing the defending forces to effectively wage guerrilla warfare.</p>
<h3>US Congress No Longer Investigating Pearl Harbor Bombing</h3>

<h3>Churchill Declares Britain is Confident in the War, Britain and the United States Have Pooled Resources, Beaverbrook to Head New Production Department</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 30th, Huitong News Agency - According to news from London, yesterday was the third day of debate in the British House of Commons. Before holding a vote of confidence, Prime Minister Churchill made another speech, stating that all the resources of Britain and the United States have now been pooled. A Raw Materials Bureau will be established in London, similar to the one organized in Washington. The arrival of American troops in Britain is the wish of the American people and leaders, allowing British troops to reinforce the Far East. It is currently impossible to predict the outcome of the Johor battle, but it is known that reinforcements have been arriving steadily in recent weeks. The sinking of the "Prince of Wales" was due to the lack of an aircraft carrier at the time, but he did not want to excuse it. He believes that Britain is confident in the final victory, and everyone must act according to their conscience.</p>
<p>London, 29th, Havas - Before the House of Commons passed the vote of confidence in the government, Prime Minister Churchill answered questions, stating, "It is difficult to predict the fate of Johor Bahru and Singapore at this time. However, I can assure the members of the House of Commons that fresh British troops and aircraft are currently being sent to reinforce them. Regarding the sinking of our battleships 'Prince of Wales' and 'Repulse' by Japanese aircraft, our dispatch of these two battleships to the Far East was in the 'hope that this would keep Japan out of the war, or at least prevent the Japanese General Headquarters from dispatching merchant fleets to the Gulf of Thailand. The United States had issues in Hawaii and had no time to spare. At the time, there was no American battleship. The 'Prince of Wales' was the only battleship that could reach the area to deal with the overall situation.' As for the general situation of the war in the Far East, I am willing to take full responsibility for the 'general military arrangements,' but this does not mean that I will not investigate the malfeasance of responsible officers. We have indeed made serious mistakes, but it is even more absurd to think that this weakness is the reason for the setbacks suffered by Britain and the United States due to the temporary loss of maritime hegemony in the Pacific. Even before the Pearl Harbor incident, the chances of British success were greatly reduced due to the Japanese army's entry into Vietnam and the establishment of extremely valuable bases there. If our country had not been fighting in the Nile River Valley and other areas, it would have been able to deal with the Japanese invasion of Vietnam. However, Britain cannot fight Germany, Italy, and Japan alone. Although we hold valuable contacts at staff meetings in Singapore with the United States, the Commonwealth of Australia, and the Dominion of New Zealand, we are 'deeply concerned' about the development of the situation. Our parliamentary system is the most perfect. In today's world, there is no wartime government in any country that can participate in debates and accept criticism from all sides. The main task of the House of Commons is to produce an effective administrative organ. I have benefited greatly from this House debate and will consider the opinions expressed by all parties, even those put forward by the opposition to the Cabinet. As for the alliance between Britain and the United States, all resources of the two countries are now concentrated in one place and used jointly. In addition, regarding the war in Libya, North Africa, one thing can be asserted: the war in Libya seems to be able to create a second front, so that the German army cannot attack the Caucasus. 'In any case, from now on, the Nile River Valley can rest easy.' In short, although the offensive we have adopted in Libya is not as important as the war on the Eastern Front, this move has forced the enemy to withdraw a large number of air forces from the Eastern Front in this critical moment."</p>
<p>Stockholm, 30th, Huitong News Agency - A dispatch from London stated that political figures in London predict that Lord Beaverbrook will be appointed Minister of Production. The establishment of the department was requested by the Labour Party, and Prime Minister Churchill accepted the proposal to appease the Labour Party. It is not known whether the Labour Party agrees to have Beaverbrook head the department.</p>
<h3>Soviet Announcement of Recapture of Sukhi̇nivichi, etc. – Crimean German Forces Repulse Soviet Troops – Italian Newspaper Reports Soviet Use of Secret Weapons on Eastern Front</h3>
<p>Moscow, January 30th, Reuters – The Soviet Supreme Command announced last night: “After fierce fighting yesterday, Soviet troops repulsed the German counterattack in the central sector and recaptured the cities of Sukhi̇nivichi (central sector), Lokhvitsa (southwestern sector), and Pavlograd (southern sector).</p>
<p>Berlin, January 30th, Transocean News Agency – Military experts supplemented yesterday’s German war report, stating that Allied forces on the Eastern Front continue to inflict heavy blows on the invading Soviet troops. On Wednesday, we received reports of unsuccessful Soviet landings on the southern coast of Crimea. After several days of fighting in the freezing snow, the German-Romanian Allied forces inflicted heavy casualties on the Soviets and completely defeated the Soviet attempt to advance eastward from Feodosia via the sea to attack the German rear. The Soviets value their Crimean base and spare no sacrifices, launching bloody attacks, but the results are still nil. The German Air Force, under extremely adverse weather conditions, is still striving to assist the army in combat, while also striking at enemy transport lines. Yesterday’s communiqué stated that Soviet transport planes were shot down by German aircraft, indicating that Soviet front and rear communications have been cut off, or at least a considerable number of Soviet troops are surrounded, forcing them to transport supplies by air. Reviewing the situation on the Eastern Front, it is clear that although the Soviet troops are constantly counterattacking, they have not yet achieved their intended goals, namely, they have neither conquered Kharkiv nor Smolensk, nor have they broken through the encirclement of Leningrad.”</p>
<p>Rome, January 29th, Havas – Local newspapers today carried dispatches from correspondents stationed in Berlin, stating that German military authorities have recently discovered two types of secret weapons used by the Red Army on the Eastern Front. The first type is “attack aircraft,” called “demolition aircraft,” equipped with several machine guns and a small cannon. The fuselage is protected by thick iron plates, which cannot be damaged unless by intense anti-aircraft fire. They are quite effective in low-altitude bombing, and their speed is unmatched by ordinary aircraft. This type of aircraft appeared at the beginning of the German-Soviet war, but in small numbers, and had no major impact on the war. The second type is heavy-tonnage tanks, called P34. As early as October last year, the Red Army used this type of heavy-tonnage tank, which advanced as usual under German direct-fire artillery fire, without any obstacles. However, two vehicles were destroyed by German “suicide squads” using hand grenades and transported back to Germany for expert research. It was learned that the iron frame of this type of tank is not only thick but also made of special materials, which cannot be destroyed by bullets and shrapnel. In view of this, German military authorities have manufactured bullets that can penetrate this type of tank, so that the Soviet Union no longer has secret weapons. In addition, German engineers are now working hard to manufacture terrifying weapons in preparation for launching an offensive next spring.”</p>
<h3>Anglo-Soviet-Iranian Treaty Officially Signed</h3>

Mr. Bullitt refused to make any statements at the airport, only saying that he would go to Washington to report everything to Roosevelt.</p>
<h3>Three South American Countries Sever Relations with Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, January 30th, Transocean News Agency – According to Mr. Hori, a spokesman for the Japanese Information Bureau, Brazil has not formally notified the Japanese government of the severance of diplomatic relations with Japan, but the severance of relations between the two countries is beyond doubt. Uruguay and Peru have officially notified Japan of the severance of diplomatic relations. Currently, Peruvian diplomats cannot leave Japan, and their freedom of movement has been restricted.</p>
<h3>France Denies Dakar is Being Used by Germany</h3>
<p>Vichy, January 30th, Transocean News Agency – Official sources here strongly deny British reports that the port of Dakar in West Africa has been opened as a German submarine base. A recent article in the “People’s Observer” stated that German submarines could take refuge in the port of Dakar or other French seaports. Britain then spread such rumors based on this, which is extremely unwise. Officials here solemnly stated that the claim that German submarines are using French seaports to patrol the American coast is not true.</p>
<h3>Southern Ireland Denies German Paratroopers Have Landed</h3>
<p>Dublin, January 29th, Havas – The President of the Executive Council of the Republic, Mr. de Valera, stated in the House of Representatives in response to a question from a member: “Regarding the rumor that German paratroopers have landed in Southern Ireland and have made actual contact with the Irish Republican Army, if it proves to be untrue, those who spread the rumors, once identified, will be handed over to the military commission for disposal.”</p>
<h3>U.S. Senate Examining Naval Budget</h3>
<p>Washington, January 29th, Havas – The U.S. naval budget of 2 billion U.S. dollars, including the funds needed to manufacture 27,000 new-type combat aircraft for the navy, is currently under study by Congress. When the Senate Finance Committee discussed this case today, Naval Secretary Colonel Knox attended to explain the reasons and predicted that once this naval plan is implemented, the United States will be able to occupy an absolute advantage in all the oceans of the world. As for the manufacture of 27,000 new-type combat aircraft, it is part of President Roosevelt’s plan to strengthen the U.S. Air Force.</p>
<h3>Plants That Can Fill Your Stomach in Times of Famine</h3>
<p>Written by Professor Li Te of the Lester Institute of Medical Research</p>
<p>At the beginning of the 15th century, China had a book called "Emergency Food Plants," which listed 414 kinds of plants that could fill your stomach in times of famine. Many of them are cited as having nutritional value in Western books. These plants are divided into five categories: grass, trees, grains, fruits, and vegetables. Each plant listed in "Emergency Food Plants" has a woodcut illustration. At that time, Europe did not yet know the art of woodcut. Although these woodcuts were much more sophisticated than later European woodcuts, they lacked scientific details. The leaves of the plants were not clearly depicted, so many plants cannot be accurately identified. The rest, however, are clearly and accurately depicted, with their names and descriptions, so there is no mistake.</p>
<p>The identified plants of each category are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Grass (A) Leaves and Stems: Plantain, Inula, Calendula, Wild Meal Dumpling, Daylily (Yellow Flower Vegetable), Fennel, Dayflower, Small Peach Red (Phoenix), (B) Roots: Lily, Ophiopogon japonicus, Glehnia littoralis, Calamus, (C) Seeds and Fruits: Muslim Rice, Cedrela sinensis, Tribulus terrestris, Cock’s Comb Fruit, (D) Leaves and Buds: Dock Seedling, Groundcherry, Cocklebur, Rubia cordifolia Seedling, Vaccaria segetalis, (E) Roots and Leaf Tips: Burdock, Cattail Shoots, Apricot Leaf Glehnia littoralis, Hosta Shoots, (F) Stems: Sagittaria trifolia, Bamboo Shoots, Nymphoides peltata.</p>
<p>Trees (A) Leaves: Albizia julibrissin, Hibiscus syriacus, Poplar, Toona sinensis Sprouts, (B) Fruits: Ziziphus jujuba, Lonicera japonica, Mountain Rowan, (C) Leaves and Fruits: Lycium chinense, Toona sinensis Peach Tree, Cypress, Cudrania tricuspidata, (D) Flowers: Wisteria sinensis Vegetable, Sophora japonica Sprouts, Catalpa bungei, (E) Flowers, Leaves and Fruits: Pyrus betulifolia, Xanthoceras sorbifolium, (F) Leaves, Bark and Fruits: Mulberry Tree, Elm Seeds.</p>
<p>Grains and Related Genera: Tender Leaves and Seeds: Buckwheat Seedlings, Sesame, Soybeans, Broad Beans, Perilla frutescens Seedlings.</p>
<p>Home Fruits and Tubers (A) Fruits: Water Caltrop, Soft Jujube, Wild Grape, Wild Cherry, (B) Fruits and Leaves: Pomegranate, Apricot Tree, Jujube Tree, Peach, (C) Stems: Hairy Taro, Water Chestnut, (D) Stems and Seeds: Coix lacryma-jobi.</p>
<p>Vegetables (A) Leaves: Amaranth, Purslane, Beet, Erigeron annuus, Winter Mallow, Polygonum hydropiper Sprouts, Clover, Japanese Catnip, Shepherd's Purse, Taraxacum mongolicum, (B) Stems: Stachys geobotrya, (C) Stems and Leaves: Wild Onion, (D) Leaves and Fruits: Shepherd's Purse, Perilla frutescens, Lambsquarters, (E) Stems and Seeds: Yam.</p>
<p>The above and other plants total 414 kinds. It can be seen that any plant, if the taste is not too bad, can be eaten, and the number is certainly large. However, there are also those that are harmful to the body if eaten in excess. For example, Forsythia leaves contain glycogen, and Sorrel, like rhubarb leaves, contains oxalic acid, which is harmful to the kidneys and causes blood in the urine. Acorns can cause severe dysentery. In recent years, ignorant people in the oil head area have used the ground powder of Cibotium barometz as food. Cibotium barometz originally contains toxic substances, and there are many cases of poisoning and hospitalization.</p>
<p>In this short article, a slightly more detailed description can be given of several kinds of plants that have already sprouted or will soon sprout.</p>
<p>Dandelion is a very common vegetable, and has been eaten by people all over the world since ancient times. It can be planted by oneself and harvested in spring. The leaves are large and tender, with a slightly bitter taste. It is known for containing protein and mineral salts. The phosphorus and ash it contains are better than spinach, calendula, or lettuce. Its magnesium content is also better than lettuce and cabbage. It also contains important metals such as iron, copper, manganese, and zinc, and is rich in vitamin C.</p>
<p>Shepherd’s Purse is a wild vegetable that is sold in the market. It has a delicious and slightly spicy taste. Its basic chemical composition is the same as that of dandelion. The amount of vitamins A and B1 it contains is the same. Iron and vitamin C are more abundant, and it is rich in iron, ash, and other minerals.</p>
<p>Plantain is a weed that grows all over the world. "Emergency Food Plants" calls it a sweet and non-toxic vegetable. Its tender shoots can be harvested and cooked with oil and salt to fill the stomach. The seed-bearing flower spikes are very rich in vitamin B1.</p>
<p>Dayflower, also known as Bamboo Leaf Vegetable, its tender shoots can be used as food, and it turns old when it blooms blue flowers. Regarding many other plants, such as Purslane and Quinoa, people in other countries also like to eat them. There are several kinds of garden quinoa, which are often sold in the market. In fact, Chinese people rarely do not eat all kinds of plants, whether wild or cultivated, if they can be eaten.</p>

<h3>Urgent Population Census Time – International Settlement Volunteers Assist Police – Those Leaving Shanghai to Return to Native Place Should Quickly Prepare Application Procedures</h3>
<p>The International Settlement Volunteers will assume civil duties on Sunday, the first time since the outbreak of the Pacific War that they will take over some police work from the Municipal Police, so that the Municipal Police can send more personnel to expedite the population census of the Public Concession. About 200 Volunteer members will be dispatched to take over police work. However, according to the International Settlement Volunteers, it has not yet been decided which unit will be dispatched. It is heard that the population census of the Public Concession will be conducted by 600 people, all of whom are Municipal Police personnel, and it will take about two weeks to complete. All preparations for the formal population census in the two Concessions have been completed.</p>
<p>How to Divide Households is Determined by Oneself</p>
<p>The period for the formal population census in the Public Concession and the French Concession has been delayed for a long time. Now the two Concessions are scheduled to conduct the population census simultaneously from February 1st. The population census form is divided into two copies, the original and the duplicate, and is distributed according to the house. Each taxpayer (i.e., the second landlord of each house, the manager of each business organization) should be responsible for truthfully filling out the form and retaining the duplicate of the population census form (printed in red). Each household or business organization should fill out one form. Each taxpayer should determine for themselves how to divide those who stay overnight in their houses into households in the most appropriate way. For example, how to divide households if the entire house is a residential household, how to classify people into their affiliated business organizations if there are several business organizations living in one house, and how to classify a part of the people into the residential household and a part of the people into the business organization if the house is a combination of residential households and business organizations. However, each person is only allowed to fill out the form once. The items required to be filled out in the form are: Name (Adult males who are unemployed should add a small circle next to their name to indicate), the head of the household's title for each person, province of origin, gender, age. Each taxpayer must designate one person in their house before February 1st to immediately inform the investigators, accompanied by the constables, how many population census forms are needed for the house. Each Chinese population census form can fill in the names of 20 people, and each foreign population census form can fill in the names of 15 people. However, it should be noted that each form is only allowed to fill in one household or one organization. All those who stay overnight in the house must be filled in, otherwise, there is no need to list them. Travelers staying in hotels and inns should each fill out a form. Managers and staff of business organizations who do not stay overnight in the office should not be filled in, but the manager of the business organization must sign and seal the population census form. The original copy of the population census form (printed in black) will be collected by the investigators two days after it is issued (for example, if the form is issued today, it will be collected the day after tomorrow). Taxpayers should be responsible for reviewing each form to ensure that it is filled out truthfully, and should collect the original copy of the population census form (printed in black) in advance, ready to be delivered when the investigators arrive. Taxpayers who fail to comply will be severely punished.</p>
<p>Expanded Handling of Return to Native Place Applications</p>
<p>The format of the return-to-native-place permits application forms issued by the Works Department Building Permit Issuance Office and its newly established offices in the Northwest, East, and Three Northeast Districts have been changed since yesterday. The items to be filled out are more comprehensive, including (A) the name of the person leaving Shanghai, divided into head of the household, family members, and individuals, (B) the address in Shanghai, (C) a summary of the profession and skills before leaving Shanghai, (D) the name of the factory or other workplace, (E) the address, (F) the name of the manager or person in charge, (G) the professional skills of the unemployed, (H) the amount of salary and wages received in December 1941, (I) the intended address, and (J) the intended route, divided into waterway or land route, with the name and address of the ship or station noted.</p>
<p>Branch Offices Established</p>
<p>The Works Department established three new branch offices yesterday to handle the issuance of return-to-native-place permits and travel fare discount coupons. A considerable number of people who had previously obtained permits went to the respective offices again to apply for discount coupons. Those who obtained discount coupons paid half price for boat tickets or third-class train tickets. If a group of 200 people left Shanghai at the same time, they could also pay half price for fourth-class train tickets. The three new branch offices of the Works Department were established at Nie Zhongcheng Public School (Jingzhou Road, Baker Road), Works Department Elementary School (Aierjin Road, Keneng Hai Road), and another Works Department Elementary School (Singapore Road, Jiaozhou Road). At the same time, the Fuzhou Road Volunteer Headquarters also issued permits and discount coupons. Each branch office (excluding the main office) is open as usual on Saturdays and Sundays. Since the establishment of the first office of the Bureau on the 5th of this month, a total of approximately 44,500 permits have been issued. Those who have received permits said that they no longer need to queue up to buy rice. According to the estimate of the visa supervisor, the four offices can issue 5,000 permits per day. If more offices are added, this number can be increased.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Group Applications</p>
<p>The Bureau's Industrial and Social Affairs Department has issued several thousand permit application forms to various factories. Factory employees fill out application forms for employees and their families and send them to the visa office for permits and travel fare discount coupons. Yesterday was the first day of the establishment of the new office, and several factory representatives brought application forms to obtain permits. Any factory that wants to obtain an application form can request it from Office No. 609 of the Industrial and Social Affairs Department or any visa office. As for the issuance of travel fare discount coupons, it ends on February 15th, so there are not many days left. Those who want to leave Shanghai to return to their native place should apply quickly to avoid missing the opportunity.</p>
<h3>French Concession House Tax Collected According to New Valuation – Approximately Doubled, Tax Rate Unchanged</h3>
<p>It is learned that the Concession has changed the method of collecting house tax from January of this year. That is, all rents will be revalued, and the average increase in the same period last spring will be 100%. However, the amount of increase for those who have been occupied for a long time and those who have not been occupied for a long time is not uniform. The house tax of 30% will be collected again according to this new valuation. For example, if the original house price is 100 yuan per month, the house tax of 30 yuan per month was collected according to the 30% tax rate before. From January of this year, the calculation standard has been changed, and the house price will be increased by 100% uniformly, that is, 200 yuan. The house tax will be changed to 60 yuan per month according to the 30% tax rate again. There is no change in the original tax rate.</p>
<h3>Principal and Interest of Consolidated Bonds Paid in Chongqing – Shanghai Branch Not Temporarily Handling</h3>
<p>The 12th redemption of the five types of consolidated bonds has been completed for types A, B, C, and D. Type E has been temporarily changed to be held in Chongqing. The principal and interest due for the winning numbers will be paid by the Central Bank and the China Communications Bank entrusted by it from tomorrow. However, the Shanghai branches of the Central Bank and the China Communications Bank will not temporarily handle the payment. Other banks have also suspended collecting principal and interest on behalf of customers, so the principal and interest due for this period cannot be collected in Shanghai. It is heard that various small money houses in the market are willing to buy the winning bonds, but they are discounted by 15% up and down according to the face value. As for the uncollected winning bonds and interest coupons of the 11th period, the Shanghai branches of the Central Bank and the China Communications Bank have also stopped paying them. Shanghai will not handle the payment for the Republic of China 25-year Revival Public Bonds due at the end of February and the Republic of China 17-year Financial Long-Term Public Bonds due at the end of March, and they will be handled in the same way as the consolidated bonds.</p>
<h3>Eight Robbers Arrested at Yile Tian Teahouse</h3>
<p>Feng Baishun, Chinese Chief Detective of the Louzear Police Station, Deputy Chief Detective Huang Fusen, and Detectives Yang Yun, Liu Zhaonian, and Ma Bingzhang, secretly reported yesterday morning that many fierce robbers were tasting tea and discussing matters at the Yile Tian Teahouse on Nanjing Road. They rushed to the address and arrested Hu Lao Yi (32 years old, Wuxi), Lin Zhengyu (24 years old, Ningbo), Yu Jinshan (26 years old, Yuyao), Wang Jinxiang (28 years old, Shanghai), and Chen A Jin (26 years old, Ningbo) on the spot. According to the confession of the robbers, they continued to arrest the robber gang members Wang Shiyu (21 years old, Ningbo), Cao Guisen (24 years old), and Chen Miaogen (20 years old) at 11:50 a.m. at Room 21, Qichang Hotel, No. 6, Lane 588, Hankou Road. Two fake pistols were found and taken to the police station for interrogation.</p>
<p>Two Police Stations Escorted 20 Fierce Robbers</p>
<p>The Putuo Road and Xinwen Police Stations recently received reports from informants and captured a large number of notorious robbers, Zhang Qiuyi, Shen Qiugen, Chen Bingcai, Liu Yuncheng, Wang Wenxuan, Lu Huawen, Lu Xiaxian, Gao Deshi, Ma Guangqi, Ding Huafu, Chen Awei, Shen Yaokun, Jiang Weimin, and Gao Defu, etc., in the Concession and outside the Concession. One pistol and four bullets were seized. It was found that Zhang and others had committed the following crimes: Robbing Zhang Zhongji of 45,000 yuan in national currency at the intersection of Mei Bei Ge Road and Bai Ke Road on November 21 last year; Robbing Hai Hongren of a self-prepared pistol and five bullets at No. 56, Chengdu Road on August 30 last year; Robbing Qian Fanghan of 6,549 yuan in national currency in Room 5, No. 156, Beijing Road on January 5 this year, and many other cases. They were escorted to the First Special Court yesterday and prosecuted for robbery. After the judge interrogated them, he ordered them to be detained for another hearing.</p>
<p>Chinese Detective Chen Jinsheng and Li Yinmin of the Xinwen Police Station arrested the robbers Qian Xiaojin, Zhou Fengyan, Qian Jinchang, Qian Shunshan, Chen Tunan, and Qian Rongshan in Room 462, Jueshi Hotel, No. 250, Yu Qiaqing Road, a few days ago. It was found that these people had committed no less than a dozen cases of theft and extortion of huge sums of money by writing threatening letters in the Concession. Due to lack of time, it is still difficult to investigate in detail, so they were escorted to the court yesterday to request temporary detention for investigation before formally filing a complaint. The court briefly interrogated them and ordered another hearing.</p>
<h3>New Time Implemented Starting Midnight Tonight</h3>
<p>In order to save electricity and increase office efficiency, the two Concessions will implement daylight saving time early, starting at midnight tonight, advancing the clock by one hour. The closing time of various entertainment venues such as dance halls, nightclubs, theaters, and cinemas will also be changed to 10:00 p.m. new time. The running time of trams in the two Concessions and buses in the French Concession will also be changed according to the new time, leaving the factory and entering the factory earlier. It is also learned that the time report of the Xujiahui Observatory will also be based on the new time, and the clock on the Jianghai Customs and Post Office Building will be advanced by one hour starting at midnight tonight.</p>
<h3>It is Said that French Concession Trams Will Increase Prices Starting Next Month</h3>
<p>It is learned that the price increase of French Concession trams has been approved and will be implemented on February 1st. The new fare for first class will increase from 18 cents to 20 cents, and then increase by 5 cents per stop. The longest distance from Xujiahui to the 16th Pier has increased to a high price of 50 cents. The fare for third class will be at least 15 cents, and then increase by 1 cent or 2 cents per stop, but the odd numbers will be added to 5 cents or 10 cents, for example, if the original price is 22 cents, it will be 24 cents after adding 2 cents, and then add 1 cent to make up 25 cents. The highest will be 30 cents.</p>
<h3>The Rental Housing Problem Must be Considered as a Whole</h3>
<p>According to a public announcement from the Works Department Information Office, the entire issue of managing the subletting of houses is still under consideration by the Bureau. Before the regulations are approved and promulgated, citizens are requested not to submit the proposed subletting methods to the Bureau for approval or apply to the Bureau for mediation of disputes.</p>
<h3>Works Department Rice Sales Office Will Only Sell Broken Rice Starting Today</h3>
<p>The Works Department recently issued a notice stating that the rice sales offices of the Bureau located on Gordon Road, Fair Road, and Hua Min Road will only sell broken rice starting on January 31.

<h3>Guohua News Agency Established – Started Sending Drafts on February 1st</h3>
<p>Since the preparation of the Guohua News Agency began, it has been generally ready. It is scheduled to officially send out drafts on February 1st (this Sunday). The internal composition of the agency has a long history in the news industry, and the reporting work has always been in-depth. Therefore, the reporting of various news is fast and accurate. It is an emerging force and will definitely contribute to the newspaper industry.</p>
<h3>False Alarm at Tianyun Lou the Night Before</h3>
<p>At about 8:00 p.m. the night before, a vicious fight occurred in the rooftop flower enclosure of the Wing On Company due to prostitutes soliciting customers, which caused a misunderstanding. Pedestrians avoided it, and shops closed. After the Old Zha Police Station sent detectives to find out the truth, the matter was calmed down. As a result, the police station arrested three men who caused the incident and escorted them to the First Special Court yesterday and prosecuted them for violating the prohibition, sentencing the three defendants to a fine of 15 yuan each as a warning.</p>
<h3>Lost Leather Wallet</h3>
<p>I picked up a leather wallet containing banknotes and other sundries in a tram car (car number B59) on the way east to west on Shandong Road at 9:00 p.m. last night (January 28). I handed it over to ticket seller No. 571 and asked him to hand it over to the general writing room of the tram company at No. 185 Suzhou Road. If you have lost it, please go to the above location and explain the correct numbers to claim it. Wang Qianqi</p>

<h3>申報 Reader's Aid Fund for Students - Reader's Letters Respond - Appeal to All Sectors to Donate - Free and Half-Price Enrollment Opportunities Continue to Be Open for Application Today</h3>
<p>Our newspaper yesterday received a letter from reader Mr. Shicheng, earnestly appealing to all sectors. The original letter is as follows: "With the general economic decline in Shanghai, the pursuit of education for young people has become a major challenge. On one hand, some families are suffering from unemployment or reduced income. On the other hand, tuition fees are generally increasing due to the financial difficulties of schools. The cost of educating children, which was already a significant burden for middle-class families, has now become almost unbearable. Seeking a way out of this predicament, the reader's aid fund promoted by this newspaper is perfectly suited to this need. The number of applications has reached thousands, which precisely illustrates the widespread danger of dropping out of school due to economic threats. Moreover, it is unknown how many more have not even had the opportunity to apply for various reasons. How can the tens of thousands of dollars currently available be sufficient to address this issue? The immense difficulty in reviewing and selecting applicants can also be imagined. The only remedy is to increase the amount of aid. One more donation of a hundred or ten dollars means one less young person being left out and dropping out of school. But this can only be achieved by appealing for enthusiastic support from the community. Of course, the economic capacity of people in Shanghai is now vastly different from what it used to be. Even those with substantial assets are experiencing various difficulties. However, given the size of Shanghai, providing educational expenses for a few thousand or even more young people should not be a problem. Amidst this chorus of austerity, are there not excessive extravagances everywhere? Think of the tension among these thousands of young people caught between their desire for knowledge and the danger of dropping out of school. The rapid expansion of the aid fund should be a shared responsibility."</p>
<p>Free and Half-Price Enrollment Opportunities</p>
<p>The application for the reader's aid fund of this newspaper closed on the 26th. We are currently organizing and reviewing the applications, and the list of approved aid recipients will be announced soon.

<h3>Spot Goods Flood the Market - Bond Market Collapses - Foreign Stock Trading Turns Active</h3>
<p>The over-the-counter bond market continued to decline yesterday. Category A bonds broke the 70-yuan mark, and market sentiment remained sluggish with no signs of recovery. Category C bonds opened yesterday, immediately breaking 7 yuan to 66 yuan, 5 jiao. Subsequently, the price fluctuated between 66 yuan and 6 yuan, 2 or 3 jiao. Ultimately, due to strong selling pressure from Lianyi, Tongkang, Zhenchang, and Hu Heji, even though Dingkang, Yitai, Tongji, and Maoxin bought in, the supply still outweighed demand. The price broke 6 yuan again, reaching a low of 5 yuan, 7 jiao, before recovering to 6 yuan, 4 jiao at the close due to sudden demand from Tongyi. Category A bonds initially opened at 70 yuan, briefly reaching 69 yuan, 8 jiao before closing at 70 yuan. Category B bonds traded at 67 yuan, 5 jiao, falling to 7 yuan, 3 jiao before rebounding to 7 yuan, 8 jiao, and closing at 7 yuan, 5 jiao.

Category E bonds traded at 64 yuan, 5 jiao, falling to 3 yuan, 9 jiao before closing at 4 yuan, 1 jiao, resulting in a further decline of 5 or 6 jiao to 1 yuan. There were no buyers after the close. Trading volume was approximately 600,000 to 700,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign stocks rebounded strongly, and trading volume increased. A total of 7,600 shares of industrial and public utility stocks were traded, and 100 shares of rubber stocks were traded. It is rumored that HSBC Bank sent a letter to the Stockbrokers Association urging them to register transactions before December 8th. Therefore, there is speculation of priced settlements, and the current prices are too low, which stimulated buying interest and boosted market confidence. Jardine Spinning Mill saw the most trading activity, with a total of 1,300 shares traded. The price rose from 25 yuan to 26 yuan, but then sellers appeared, and buyers bid 25 yuan, 5 jiao. China Textile traded 1,000 shares at 8 yuan, 6 jiao. Tramway traded 500 shares at 32 yuan, 5 jiao, and 500 shares at 32 yuan. There were few sellers afterwards.

<h3>Cash Transactions - Less Speculation</h3>
<p>Yesterday's over-the-counter market for cash was less speculative, accounting for only 10 to 20 percent of transactions. The market situation was more stable. According to sources, the atmosphere was quiet and business was dull. In the morning, each tael (ten liang) was initially traded by two gold shops at 10,900 yuan, 20 yuan higher. Securities firms such as Tongkang Yong and a certain gold shop began to sell, and the price gradually fell by 130 yuan to 770 yuan. Yongfeng Yu Chengji bought, raising the price to 820 yuan. Afterwards, the price hovered around 800 yuan. At noon, the price was 10,810 yuan, 70 yuan lower than the previous day. The price fluctuated by 130 yuan throughout the day. A total of 1,200 to 1,300 taels were traded across various locations. Gold ornaments were still priced at 1,150 yuan, and silver was priced at 16 yuan. There were buyers for black market silver at 10 yuan per yuan of silver coin at 6 yuan each, but there were few sellers, it is said.</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign currency market conditions saw the British pound and the U.S. dollar each fall by 5 yuan. The former fell to 270 yuan, and the latter fell to 275 yuan. U.S. dollar notes were 15 yuan, 6 jiao and a half, Hong Kong notes were 2 yuan, 7 jiao and a half, and military notes were 3 yuan, 9 jiao, 8 fen, and 3 li.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Indirectly Softens</h3>
<p>The selling price of Changshu Chen rice varies from 1670 yuan to 190+ yuan, depending on the quality of the goods. Newly arrived Wuhu rice is uniformly sold publicly at 150 yuan per shi. Therefore, market sentiment is indirectly softening, and buying interest is strong but turning stagnant. Northern rice and Baiyuan rice are weakening first, and early and late rice are also showing a flat trend. Kunshan Bai rice opened at 228 yuan to 224 yuan, Jintan glutinous rice at 207 yuan, and Southern early and late rice at 198 to 197 yuan. Approximately 300 bags were traded in the market. Only half of those reporting were present, and there were fewer small vendors and direct distributors, it is said.</p>
<p>Agar-agar has long been lacking in the regular market. Although there are occasional embellishments from informal over-the-counter transactions and direct distribution, the black market is secretly unverifiable. Reported prices vary. Yesterday, it was heard that American pink agar-agar was 49 yuan including fees, and Kanfen Golden Dragon brand was 45-46 yuan, with a few transactions, it is said.</p>
<h3>Most Miscellaneous Grains Return to Flat</h3>
<p>The supply and demand for edible oil were both quiet yesterday, and transactions were calm.</p>
<p>Soybeans have stopped rising and turned flat. This is because scattered stockpiles are gradually being sold off at high prices. It is estimated that 80 bags of Tianjin new Jin Yuan soybeans were sold, priced at 142-143 yuan, one carload of Wuhu soybeans, priced at 122 yuan, and 20 bags of Pudong soybeans, priced at 124 yuan.</p>
<p>Red beans are still actively selling, and the supply is scarce, leading to an upward trend of 3-4 yuan. It is estimated that 50 bags of Chongming sand red beans were sold, priced at 89-90 yuan. Broad beans are trending stable. Yesterday, 50 bags of Chongming sand broad beans were traded, priced at 68 yuan.</p>
<p>Soybean cake transactions were slightly weaker yesterday, and stockpilers seemed less eager, so the price saw a decline of half a yuan. It is estimated that 2,000 pieces of Shenji soybean cake warehouse receipts in six lots were sold, priced at 26 yuan and a half to 26 yuan.</p>
<p>The corn market initially strengthened and then weakened, and the final result was similar to before. It is estimated that 100 bags of Dutch white corn were sold, priced at 52 yuan, and 200 bags of yellow corn, priced at 53 yuan, 150 bags of mixed yellow and old corn, priced at 53 yuan and a half, and 400 bags of new corn, priced at 57 yuan, 8 jiao at the Western warehouse, 57 yuan and a half to 55 yuan and a half at the Cambodian warehouse, and 59 yuan and a half delivered to the door. Also, 200 tons from Inghua, priced at 82 yuan to 82 yuan and a half for goods in the Hongkou warehouse, and 92 yuan and a half for goods in the Hongsheng warehouse.</p>
<p>The peanut kernel street sales continue, and the market continues to trend upward. Yesterday, more than 100 bags of Jiangbei new peanut kernels were sold, priced at 225 yuan, and 100 bags of Linzhun Guan new peanut kernels, priced at 195 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Market Stable</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: The market was bleak yesterday. Fortunately, the current cloth market can remain stable, but there are few sales. Ten packages of 12-pound Dapeng fine cloth were traded, priced at 93 yuan, 7 jiao and a half per bolt. Xiaoji blue cloth was 153 yuan. Several dozen pieces of other miscellaneous brand blue cloths were traded in this street, priced at around 150 yuan.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Yesterday, the spot market for fine cloth was still active, and prices were firm. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth was traded at 89 yuan, 2 jiao and a half, factory bill at 86 yuan, 2 jiao and a half, Rainbow Ball spot goods at 88 yuan and a half, warehouse bill at 84 yuan and a half. Only the Four Gentlemen Serge was the softest, spot goods at 3 yuan, 5 fen, warehouse bill at only 2 yuan, 8 jiao, 4 or 5 fen.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Still Stagnant</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn situation was stagnant all day. This was because it was raining, and Tonghe Guli could not gather outdoors. Although some yarn merchants talked under the eaves, they could not gather due to the sparse number of people, making it difficult to complete transactions. However, the factory bill price for 20-count Double Horse was approximately 1,325 yuan, which was about the same as the previous day. However, the spot market was very strong, and the supply was very short. The market price was rising with no signs of decline.</p>
<h3>Sugar Shortage</h3>
<p>Recently, the goods sealed in the foreign warehouses of the sugar market are not yet available. Only five or six thousand bags are stored in the local warehouses, which feels quite short. According to the market situation, prices must rise, with the increase for Zhenji No. 1 white being approximately 25 yuan, No. 1 ice sugar 10 yuan, No. 24 coarse white 30 yuan, Dutch red and cart red even scarcer, 20-30 yuan, and Taigu cart white 20 yuan, with a similar increase for cart ice sugar.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Jujubes Sell Best in Ningbo</h3>
<p>Miscellaneous jujubes, such as Fu red and Chang red, are selling very actively in Ningbo. However, 2,000 to 3,000 bags have already been shipped, and there is a sense that supply exceeds demand, causing prices to fall in Ningbo, even to the point of being inverted. According to a telegram from Ningbo, the prices have rebounded by 4-5 yuan, but it is still difficult to approach. If the prices continue to rise, it will be cost-effective, it is said.</p>
<h3>Hawthorn Flakes Discontinued in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Hawthorn flakes are mainly sold to Guangdong and Hong Kong. However, since the outbreak of the Pacific War, shipments have been discontinued. Except for sporadic purchases by pharmacies, there are almost no inquiries. Therefore, the market price is gradually easing. It has now fallen by 20-30 yuan, and there is still a lack of a regular market, it is said.</p>

<h3>The Meaning of "Daylight Saving Time"</h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>This year's "Daylight Saving Time" will be implemented early, starting at midnight today. Although the weather is cold and the year is ending, the sunshine, like golden velvet, cannot yet attract people's attention; however, after the neon lights are extinguished at night, the daytime is still more pleasing than the night.</p>
<p>"Daylight Saving Time" is simply moving the clock forward one hour. It does not have much impact on people who work several hours each day and then receive payment. For example, office workers who work "nine to five" actually work six full hours, excluding the lunch break from twelve to two. Arriving at the office one hour earlier in the morning and leaving one hour earlier in the afternoon does not reduce the need for electric lights during working hours, even with electricity restrictions. However, since the implementation of this movement, it is said to have had significant effects, so this year it is being implemented even earlier than last year.</p>
<p>Since the trams are brought into the depot earlier, the entertainment venues close earlier, and the "stimulation" of highway robbers is added, the people of Shanghai are now forced to improve their past "life without the sun." — on the surface, it seems to be quite close to this movement. However, getting up early and going to bed early only improves living habits, but does not increase the meaning of life. For example, going to a teahouse to sip tea and chat after getting up early is no different from chatting in a coffee shop at night. Therefore, the "Daylight Saving Time" movement should expand its meaning now. After "saving daylight," we should "utilize daylight," in other words, "increase production." Otherwise, merely moving the clock forward one hour is just changing the name of half a catty to eight taels.</p>
<h3>Stage and Screen</h3>
<p>— A Hui</p>
<p>Nightclubs and dance halls have recently hired Li Ming and He Jianfei to direct a one-act comedy "The Mute Wife," performed by the dancers. The hall will also hold a charity tea dance at 4:00 PM on February 3rd, with Han Sen, Hong Jiong, and others participating in the performance. All proceeds, excluding expenses, will be donated to charity organizations.</p>
<p>A year ago, famous Shanghai Shen opera performers, with the assistance of many people engaged in theatrical work, organized the "Shanghai Huju Society." They removed the shortcomings of Shen opera, adopted new scripts, and new stage designs. They performed for a year at the Queen's Theater. Now, due to audience demand, after major expansion, they are scheduled to move to the Xuangong Theater today. The first play, "New Beauty Trap," is written by Song Chao, directed by Xia Tian, and performed by all Shen opera performers.</p>
<p>Li Pingqing's new work, "The Elegant and Romantic Noblewoman," is said to be adapted from "Scented Stationery Tears."</p>
<p>Guohua actors Murong Wan'er, Xu Feng, Zhou Chu, and others plan to take advantage of the abolished Lunar New Year holiday to perform "Lonely Soul in the Black Night" in Suzhou.</p>
<p>Qilin Tong will perform at the Golden Age starting on the abolished Lunar New Year, and Huang Guiqiu, Wang Xichun, and others have also been invited to perform. The popular plays are Tan-style plays such as "Battle of Taiping," "Fourth Son Visits His Mother," and "Empty City Stratagem." The highest seat price is ten yuan, and the performance period is one month.</p>
<p>Wang Yin's "Black Night Phantom" has been temporarily suspended due to actor issues.</p>
<p>Bai Yun has a contract with Guolian for a series of films, which will be fulfilled after Bai Yun's contract with Guohua expires.</p>
<h3>New Year's New Films at Asian Theaters</h3>
<p>— Duo Bao</p>

<p>Leisurely Chat on Self-Cultivation</p>
<h3>Watching, Listening, Doing</h3>
<p>— Duck Creek Translation</p>
<p>The author of this article, M. F. Burlingame, is a famous American educator. This article is translated from his collection of speeches. The original text is very long, and the following is only an excerpt.</p>
<p>—Translator's Note</p>
<p>Young people, I sincerely hope that you will never forget the meaning of "self-study." Schools, bookstores, and teachers are only helpers. True education lies in your own efforts. Resolute, continuous, and diligent study can complete a very good self-education.</p>
<p>Education has two goals: first, to develop oneself; second, to acquire knowledge. The former means to stimulate and cultivate your personality, improve your memory and understanding, and enable you to learn a more rational way of life in this journey of life than before. As for the latter, it means learning the method of grasping the essence of things.</p>
<p>There are probably four sources for acquiring knowledge through self-study: 　It comes from observation. 　It comes from experience. 　It comes from conversation. 　It comes from learning. If you work hard in these four areas, then even without teachers and schools, you can still satisfy your desire for knowledge.</p>
<p>For example, when you are walking in the fields or forests, you can see many animals, birds, and insects. Do not harm or disturb them. You should silently observe their living habits, how they eat, how they walk, and you can also distinguish their types from hearing and sight.</p>
<p>A famous natural scientist once said: "My success today is entirely due to my meticulous observation of things." Follow his example! — Meticulous observation! Then you may also become a famous natural scientist.</p>
<p>I often feel that outdoor travel is the best learning opportunity. Because through this, you can get closer to nature and better understand nature. To be honest, nature is simply the best university. No school in the world can be greater, broader, have more subjects, richer specimens, and more convenient experiments than it. You don't need to go to California, or to South America, to the Arctic Circle, to find novel materials. Everywhere in the natural world is full of things that you "have never seen or heard before," waiting for you to study, observe, and learn.</p>
<p>When you have the opportunity to visit a factory, you should carefully observe the configuration of the machinery. You must study and think about how to generate immense power from a fixed point by rotating the lever and wheel. What is the reason for this? It is necessary to thoroughly explore the cause and effect. This is the spirit of a true scholar.</p>
<p>You can also get a lot of the knowledge you need from conversations. Whenever you meet someone, if you have the opportunity to talk, you should ask him to tell you about the things he is most familiar with.</p>
<p>A learned man was asked:</p>
<p>"How did you acquire so much knowledge?"</p>
<p>He replied: "I got it from the conversation of everyone."</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that you will remember: if you want to succeed, you should read, learn, observe, think, research, reason, and meditate, always and continuously watching, listening, and doing. As for whether or not to go to school, that doesn't matter.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Seventeen - Homecoming</p>
<p>"That's right, it's all him! That's why we went out late and came back early." Old Man Han said all the way, while also secretly looking at Qiu Haitang's expression. Therefore, he hurriedly and impatiently added an explanation. "But by the heavens, that young master has never been fussy, my daughter has also seen it. If I lied to you, I'm an old turtle!"</p>
<p>Qiu Haitang couldn't help but laugh at him.</p>
<p>"Moreover, Third Brother, he always gives the money to me or to my daughter first each time he pays. The questions he asks are always proper. Given how cultured he is, your Miss Mei Bao is still worried, and these days she must drag my daughter along. Third Brother, I really have to admire you for this!" Old Man Han said to this point, habitually giving a thumbs-up. "Listening to you, you used to be a performer too. I didn't expect your family education to be so good, and your Miss Mei Bao to be so obedient, it's truly enviable!"</p>
<p>After Old Man Han said this, Qiu Haitang felt a little happier, and the unhappy expression on his face disappeared for the most part.</p>
<p>"This...is...is what you said...said...the happy event?"</p>
<p>The Han family daughter couldn't help but laugh again.</p>
<p>"I haven't finished yet!" Old Man Han hurriedly winked at his daughter, and also made his attitude extra solemn. "We are now almost like brothers. Since you asked me about this matter today, I must tell you everything I know! To talk about that young master's character, there is truly none more upright, and he has a warm heart; but then again, no matter how upright his character is, no matter how warm his heart is, if he didn't have some intention, he would never be so good to us. Third Brother, you are a sensible person, so of course I can't deceive you. From the way he looks, he really took a liking to Mei Bao the first time he saw her, but..." (320)</p>
<h3>Béthune Road at Twilight</h3>
<p>— Wu Han</p>
<p>With an empty heart, I strolled along Béthune Road with a friend. It was the twilight hour, with the sun setting and the new moon not yet risen. Dusk fell hastily on Béthune Road, with few pedestrians, displaying the transition from disarray to tranquility as the day drew to a close.</p>
<p>Gradually, it grew dark, and one could no longer see one's fingers. The grand apartments standing tall—such as Georgia—resembled the great bells in ancient temples, calmly and steadily veiled by the thin curtain of night. Dim yellow lights shone from the windows above the tenth floor. Initially, only a few scattered lights illuminated the space, but within six or seven minutes, almost all the dark window frames had transformed into a luminous world of colored glass.</p>
<p>We walked to the entrance of Sullivan's in the Western District, peering through the large street-facing glass window. We saw tables and chairs arranged inside, along with a row of high round stools beside the snack counter. Including the female clerks, there were only five people in total. Two young women sat perched at the counter, while a couple were sipping tea in the "pool area." They were all foreigners, which was not surprising.</p>
<p>I can't help but insert an anecdote here:</p>
<p>According to a friend, Sullivan's American-style bread now sells for $1.20 a loaf, and it is exceptionally white and soft. It is several times better than the half-baked, either over-baked or under-baked "mixed-color" bread found in the market. However, because it is only sold in the morning and the supply is limited, Sullivan's management has issued a "card" to those who regularly purchase the bread. Purchases are only allowed with the card, and no exceptions are made.</p>
<p>Recalling my friend's words, and looking at where we were standing, I couldn't help but long for the fortunate souls who come to purchase bread with their cards in the morning. After watching for a while, we walked south along the sidewalk. The spire of Xuhui Cathedral was no longer visible due to the thick night curtain. We only saw seven or eight bicycles, lined up head-to-tail, piercing through the darkness. The small light on the rear of each bike shone on the ground, and the weak light slowly faded away with the sound of the bell. Although they seemed very humble, in this era, in this "night" environment, they should not be underestimated.</p>
<h3>Snake and Horse</h3>
<p>— Hainan</p>
<p>According to the lunar calendar, this year is the Year of Xin Si (Snake), and next year is the Year of Ren Wu (Horse). We are now at the time between the snake's tail and the horse's head. According to general predictions, this year is the Year of the Snake, so the "one-character long snake formation" is in power. To buy $4.33 of foreign rice, one must stand in a long snake formation. To buy 95 cents per pound of plain flour, or to get a return-to-hometown permit, one must also stand in line. Even withdrawing savings from the bank requires standing in a long snake formation. The long snake can be said to be enjoying its moment. Therefore, some people predict that next year, the Year of the Horse, Shanghai residents will surely "open up the docks," because of the sluggish market and the increasing cost of living. This year, many shops within the city walls will inevitably close down, and many unemployed young people will be forced to resign, leaving them no choice but to "open up their docks" and return to their hometowns.</p>
