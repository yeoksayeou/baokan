<h3 id="c25">緬甸的卡慶人（上） <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>在雲南省的西北角，中英未定界一段，恩梅開江（即江心坡）和邁立開江，蜿蜒入緬，兩江會合，一直南流入海，這就是橫貫緬甸的伊洛瓦底江。</p>
<p>就在這兩江合流的地帶，崇山茂林間，住着强悍好鬥的卡慶Kaichin民族。有文字憑着記憶力，從老祖宗的口述，一代傳給一代，能够滔滔不絕地訴說他們的部落歷史，如果下來，準是一部荒誕不經的卡你不怕麻煩，把這幾十代和　　慶人藩殖史。卡慶人主要居留千年的生活紀錄，從頭至尾寫　地域，固然在緬甸的邊境，，可是他們的同族，還有一部份可分散在雲南西部的深山裏。</p>
<p>先從衣食住說起，卡慶人的村落，分佈在高山峻嶺或深密的樹林中，那裏沒有街道，屋子散亂零落，不相聯接，他們的理由，是預防火災的發生。屋子的支架，全用粗大的樹幹搭成，墻壁竹籬，山深林密的地方，這些材料，是取之不竭的。屋內的居室，離地面約二三尺，撑持木架如矮樓，編細竹爲席，就把席鋪在這木架上，上面住人，下面飼養着牲　，穢氣薰蒸，卡慶人處之泰然，絲毫不覺得異樣，這也許是習慣成自然吧！屋子的外　，各伸出數尺，好像一個走廊，在這下面，堆放農具，婦女們春米，男子們消閒，又是牛羊羣棲宿之所。從屋子的外觀來看，是一個長方形，它的長度從三十尺到一百尺不等，全視主人的財富而定。像這樣一個大屋子，可以住幾個小家庭，－就是說數代同堂，在一個家長系統下生活着。</p>
<p>一座房子有兩個門，據說後門供鬼神出入的，所以終年關閉着。我們訪問卡慶人的住宅時，從前門走進，把鞋襪脫掉，赤着雙足，攀登一架粗笨樓梯，踏進舖竹蓆的屋子。主人非常殷勤好客，受到極熱烈的招待，室裹沒有陳設，很低矮的小木橙，幾張睡蓆和幾個貯水竹筒及不大完整的鐵鍋，這便是室內的點綴品。我們在屋之一端，看見許多火塘運列着，父母及已婚的兒子和未婚兒女，各佔據一火塘，到了夜晚，大家便和衣而臥，在火塘畔躺下。山間有的是木材，徹夜生火，把陰翳的屋角，照耀得光明朗澈，但是濃烟薰在竹墻上，已染上漆黑之色。</p>
<p>一個長方形的屋，最多只能住上八年，以後便要漸漸地傾圯了，他們認爲不能居住時，便把舊屋付之一炬，重建新屋。他們有的是人力，有的是材料，更富於合作精神，當主人把建新屋的木材，竹子和茅草準備齊全後，村裏的人，一齊動手，在短促的兩天中，便可建立一個簇新的居所。誰也不耍工資的，當主人率同全家搬進時，置備　盛的酒肉，請大家樂一樂，這便是酬報了。</p>
<p>住的地方固然汚穢，卡慶人穿的衣服，更是髒得可怕。一付衣服穿上身，從來不肯脫下來洗濯，白天夜裏，都是這一件，眞所謂日當衣杉夜當被，除非穿到十分破爛，聽其與身體脫離關係外，決不會換一付新的。卡慶人說，他們住的地方沒有水，如果去取水洗濯，非經過峭壁縣崖，不能得到，然而他們縱使取到一點水，也必先把它作爲飲料的。</p>
<p>米是他們的主耍食物，除少數人有銅鍋，鐵　外，普通多用竹簡，等到竹簡燒焦，飯即熟透。食時不用碗箸，拿樹葉將熟飯分爲若干包，按照人數，不分賓主，不論老少，每人分給兩包，旣不能多，亦不會少，道顯然是原始時代的均產制度的飯包內的食物，除特殊階級者外，多混雜些山芋，豆，麥，等。他們不食隔夜糧，今天所吃的東西，須於今日晨起後春煮。</p>
<p>有人說，緬甸是東方的女權國，因爲女人和男子能一樣角鬥，一樣自衛，更能一樣臨危不懼，其實緬甸的女人並不是取得特殊地位；而是她們具有辦事才能，和男子同等工作；機智技巧，反駕男子而上之，所以她們的權力，顯然隨着能力的發展而加强了。卡慶的婦女也不能例外，背上肩着重負，身體　屈到九十度，雙手繞着小綫錘，一面輕輕地哼着聊以自慰的歌聲。淸早起來，預備三餐米麥，又携取長節竹筒，奔上山頭，去汲取溪水，吃完後早飯，又到深林中拾些柴草，大梱地背負回來。她們還會級織，兩條木棒把經綫拉緊，一根縛在地上的木樁，另一根就吊在自己腰部，人坐在地上，伸直兩腿，腰向後稍稍用勁，雙手於是乎慢慢地投梭。這種原始時代的工作，也能織成各種可愛的花樣。</p>
<p>靑年人也談戀愛的，屋內的火塘，便是調情的所在，家長並不禁阻，在火塘的旁邊有滿足性慾的機會。女子對於貞操觀念，不十分注重，可是有了孩子，男的便耍拿出一筆很重的罰金。雖然戀愛很自由，但婚嫁之事，仍須取決於家長，父母爲兒子擇配，第一件事是把女人的布疋手工要來，交請卜卦人，請他們算一算，如果合意的話，即秘密派人向女家請婚，議定聘金，雙方滿意後婚期便馬上決定了。當結婚的一天，新娘動身向夫家出發，隨着幾個女伴，背着一大籃子的嫁奩，夫家親戚朋友齊到，盛筵旣張，開懊暢飲。新娘登了木梯，直走到堂前，婆婆出來歡迎，向她的頸項上套一個圈兒，這表示巳經承認她是家屬之一員了。接着和丈夫見面，同在草席上坐下，用個杯兒同喝酒，你一口我一口地繼續輸流喝着，又用一枝烟據同抽，也是一口一口地交替着抽。這樣，便算完成了大典。</p>
<p>卡慶人的特質，是强悍好鬥，有仇必報。報仇，是他們應盡的責任，祖孫父子，世代相傳，如果結下了世仇，那末，說不定要幾代報復下去。</p>

<h3 id="c70">擦鞋者的教訓 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— 周默</p>
<p>走過河南路，看見「擦鞋要用氣力」「不用氣力不亮」兩句簡單廣吿，我為它激動了心弦，雖然這年頭生計這樣艱難，擦鞋小事，再不應該假手他人，可是我終爲了這個廣吿效力推動，自然坐到它候客的籐椅上去，這時我的兩足，是在期待試騐他所用的力氣！</p>
<p>開　的鞋油，空的實的黃的黑的堆在石堦的一邊，我再度詳細看他所露布這張字跡東倒西歪的廣吿，除了上面所說這兩句誘人的廣吿而外，還有十幾行小字，說是「開　已經買不到了，敝人却還備有多少，如蒙顧客要買，照市價發售」，足見擦鞋雖小道，也懂得囤貨，但是他還沒有奇貨可居，還肯照市價發售，比一般囤積者慈善得多。</p>
<p>開始擦鞋了，水洗上油旣畢，他眞的用盡平生之力，他懂得刮垢磨光，他雖未讀多少書，却發覺了墨子所謂「賴其力者生，不賴其力者不生」是他生存的原則，確實，他擦鞋所用的力氣，比較他的同業，是努力的，對鈴皮鞋，有其獨特貢獻的。</p>
<p>三分鐘，四角錢，我開始自己懷疑文人寫字的代價，我確信他非四角錢一擦不克生存，於是開始談話了。</p>
<p>「擦一雙皮鞋成本要五分錢嗎？」他說過去只要二三分，現在正要五分錢呢。我忻幸着我的話，尙未與現在社會生活脫節，果然一語中的了，接下去我想他雖然是費力，每天的收人也許不到十元吧，於是我又問他每天收入多少，「大概晴天可以做到二十幾塊錢，下雨天就少得很，」二十幾塊這使我自嘆手無縛　之力，同時想到他以氣力爲號召却眞有至理，並且雖然人人都有力氣，到是他才能將力氣貢獻到人們的足上，他繼續說：家裏有六口待哺，他平均每月收入四百餘元，他的父親，以前是輸船公司做事的，前二月失了業，現在也父習子業了，可是他力氣稍差，又無老主顧，每天平均只能收入六七元，這兩個數目字，更加明顯地證明他力氣的可貴，我約摸一算他們父子每月的收入，照目前是六七百元，我不由喟然長嘆，一面佩服他對生存掙扎，惟力是視的勇氣，一面警覺我心力交瘁兩　已斑的前途，時代督促人們「勞其筋骨餓其體膚」，除了自甘墮落者而外，擦鞋者的廣吿，與墨子唯力哲學，是應該並垂千古了。</p>
<p>我對着鞋子自慚，您雖在發光，可是這一些光，不是我所出的力，我的皮鞋愈光亮，我的懶惰罪惡就愈深，非自力不足爲榮，非自力不足更生！擦鞋者予吾的印象，深深的使我永不敢忘，「自力更生」的敎訓，得來全不費功夫呀！</p>
<h3 id="c71">風雨同舟 <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（二）悲與喜</p>
<p>但是葉大太大猛喚一聲之後，又似失去了知覺一般；雖然有時睜眼，却並不注視着任何人。葉二太太道。。「大嫂，你知道喚維城，維城回來了。這是我們兩個人的寶貝。他很好，他在喚你，你聽到嗎？黃先生的藥快煎好了，你喝個小半碗，你的病便會好起來。做娘的，不要急兒子；做兒子的，不要急娘；便大家好起來。你說到了明年，一定要跟兒子到上海去，到蘇州去，兒子這樣長大了，一定會領了你去的。大嫂你醒醒，別貪睡。嘻嘻！」</p>
<p>葉大太太像是要說話，可是舌尖不由她指揮，把參湯讓她潤了潤喉嚨，還是不成。翠珍把濾出來的大半碗湯藥捧進來，維城接在手裏，凑到　邊，先試一試溫度，又嘗一嘗藥味。顫巍巍的站近床前，喚道：「媽，藥來了！」葉二太太幫着喚：「大嫂，維城來伺候你吃藥了。維城是你的心肝，他道樣的一片孝心，藥又是仙丹一樣的，吃下去病就好了。明天，你就坐起來喝粥。現在，你張了嘴。」葉大太太很不自然的張了嘴，大家一喜。喜鵲　　匙，　珍捧藥盌；二姑奶奶端了一盌過藥的溫水，站得後一些；維城一匙一匙的喂給葉大太太吃。起初三四匙，還受，後來便不受，從　邊淌到脖子裏去。葉二太太道：「等一會再吃，不要忙。」維城又　了一匙溫水，也還是淌到脖子裏去。藥盌，溫水，羹匙，齊雜陳在妝台上，維城又悲從中來，捧着臉嗚嗚咽咽了。（二五）</p>

<h3 id="c72">竹板書 <a href="#c72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— 澤夫</p>
<p>竹板書者，唱時僅用竹板以節音，別無其他樂器，故名。其書當由蓮花落轉變而來，因蓮花落唱時亦僅用竹板，惟唱詞則較蓮花落爲文雅耳。此種唱詞，盛行於河北河南一帶，惟兩地所唱，略有不同。河北所用竹板，　長四寸寬寸半之竹板兩魂，連以　案，用拇指支於兩板之間，相　成聲。所唱多爲生物故事，編凑成詞，如「螞蟻算命」「鸚哥問答」「百花名」等。河南則除左手支兩塊大竹板外，右手又支許多相串之小竹片，俗稱節子。桌上另有醒木，與他種說書相同。所唱多係歷史及說部故事，有唱有白，如「華容道」「武松打店」「猪八戒拱地」之類。間亦有唱小曲者，如「如三字經勸夫」。唱時首有開塲白，末有收塲詞。調則有小口落子調與大口落調之分，小口落子調即唱快板，大口落子調即唱慢板，惟通常以唱快板爲多，故亦稱竹板快書云。</p>
<h3 id="c73">生活之路 <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— 杜亞聲文　江棟良圖</p>
<p>最初看見　三搶大餅饅頭，雖沒有見義勇爲去生擒而活捉之，痛恨他們「不習上」之心總是有的；漸漸也習慣了，即使看見集團搶送貨脚踏車，也祇有低低地一口氣。最初看見弄口有一具死屍，心底就浮起「白麵」兩個大字，同情是由惋惜而產生的，對於這輩「自作孽」者，同情雖廉價，也不致於拍。昨天我親眼看見个個二十多歲的靑年，在弄口倒下去，面如菜色，瘦骨嶙峋，嘴里輕輕地喊着「餓煞哉」！這自然不是毒質在血管起作用，而是胃壁沒有東西吸收所致，及至有人投給他一隻大餅的時候，他的貪婪的目光祇注射着而已不能動手拾取了；最後是放棄了道可以解決「餓煞哉」的食糧而餓煞了！</p>
<p>生而爲人，除了萬不得已而出之於死的一途，求生之心，是高於一切。阮玲玉是爲了「人言可畏」而將自己的生命作孤注之一擲，在施行手術的時候也喊着「我耍活」！然而要出之於搶的一途而苟延殘喘，能够維持幾許時日？那位『餓煞哉』的靑年竟至「美味」當前而不及一膏　吻，大槪是死不瞑目的。</p>
<p>軋米是苦事，脚酸腰疼，挨打流血，也在所勿惜，無他，要活耳！由碎米而苞米粉，而赤荳而蕃薯……還是全力以赴，無他，要活耳！國米不准運進租界以還，黎明即起，趕到徐家匯去的路上，又是一條新的長蛇，長途跋踄，不以爲苦，無他，要活耳！</p>
<p>然而生活之路是那樣狹窄，生活的代價是那樣高昂，求生之路，正如在刀的鋒上爬路，掉下來果然是深淵萬丈，能够挨過一天，膝蓋和手掌上也是鮮血淋淋！</p>
<h3 id="c74">「春天是我們的」 <a href="#c74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— 一靑</p>
<p>『我寫完「春」，最後一次放下我底自來水筆，稍微感到疲倦地掉頭四顧，春風從窗外進來，輕輕拂拭着我底臉頰，倦意即刻消失了。我知道春天已經來臨了。我叉記起淑英底話：春天是我們的……』</p>
<p>巴先生在在「春」之序中這樣地說。</p>
<p>眞的，現在是春天了，在春風的輕拂裏，我讀「春」的小說（這是第三次讀了），我又讀完胡導先生改編的「春」的劇本，在我一回壓重一回的情緒下，我拉開綠色的紗窗簾，向蔚藍的雲空望去，我非但感到這是春天啊，而且覺天外有不少活潑的年靑人在春天裏活　着</p>
<p>春天雖到了，冬天的悲凉依稀存在的，在「春」中蕙與淑英，覺新覺民兄弟，他們都從肅殺的冬天中掙扎着，以熱望寄託在春天中，也許，冰之冷酷，雪之　寒，使一股熱望壓低，甚至犧牲。蕙就是那樣怨艾地犧牲了，覺新也是抱着一顆準備犧牲的心，他們願意嗎？不，這是冬天的冰，冬天的雪，奪去了他與她的心與靈。</p>
<p>春天到底可愛的，不怕艱難挨過了冬天，春天終歸來的。你看！淑英跟覺民等，是給春風溫暖了年靑的生命。</p>
<p>「春」上舞台了，這年靑的一羣幹戲劇的伙伴們，他們當然也要吶喊：「春天是我們的！」</p>

<p>Tokyo, 16th (Domei News Agency) - Cabinet Information Bureau Deputy Spokesperson Mr. Hori, when receiving foreign journalists today, was asked about the reaction to Prime Minister Tojo's address in the Diet. Mr. Hori stated that, according to various signs, Australia seems likely to follow in the footsteps of the Dutch East Indies. Mr. Hori also cited newspaper dispatches stating that Australian Army Chief Ford had received instructions to attack Japanese forces. However, the source of this information and the location of the attack were not disclosed. Australians seem not to understand Prime Minister Tojo's intentions, which, if true, is regrettable, he said.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Haitong News Agency) - Reports have just been received stating that startling military developments will occur in New Guinea in the near future. Japanese forces, having landed in New Guinea, are advancing steadily, seeking to encircle Australian forces. Japanese naval aircraft continue to bomb enemy positions and strafe them with machine guns.</p>
<p>Vichy, 16th (Reuters) - According to reports from Tokyo, Japanese forces in New Guinea are currently traversing the jungle, advancing towards Port Moresby.</p>
<p>Sydney, 16th (Reuters) - It is reported that U.S. forces are currently cooperating in the defense of New Guinea. It is generally believed that the most important factor in the fighting there remains time. Allied forces are available for deployment and are currently being dispatched to reinforce the area. According to military strategists, a large number of aircraft must be assembled over Australia, densely like "a cloud covering," in order to secure the Allied lifeline east of the Australian continent.</p>
<p>Sydney, 16th (Reuters) - According to dispatches from Port Moresby, New Guinea, air combat occurred near Thursday Island last Saturday. It is evident that the scope of aerial combat on the Australian side is very broad. These Japanese bombers, escorted by fighters, may have departed from aircraft carriers, but this seems less likely. Port Moresby was again attacked by Japanese heavy bombers yesterday morning. Yesterday, Sunday, was designated by Prime Minister Curtin as a national day of prayer, and churches everywhere were unusually crowded.</p>
<p>London, 16th (Reuters) - A communiqué issued today by the Australian Air Force stated that Australian aircraft bombed the airfield at Dili, Portuguese Timor, yesterday afternoon. Several islands near New Cape St. George were attacked by Japanese aircraft. Fighters quickly scrambled to intercept. Also, the Japanese aircraft that attacked Port Moresby last Saturday were bombers, their target being an airfield. New Guinea was not attacked by Japanese aircraft fleets at the end of the week.</p>
<p>Sydney, 16th (Reuters) - A dispatch from Port Moresby to the Sydney Morning Herald stated that Japanese aircraft were widely active yesterday. Approximately nine fighters and bombers flew over the Torres Strait. The attack on Port Moresby involved heavy bombers, indicating a gradual increase in Japanese aircraft sorties, apparently in preparation for a large-scale attack.</p>
<p>Allied Forces Rebuild Pacific Fleet</p>
<p>Washington, 15th - Regarding the details of the Java Sea battle announced jointly by Washington and London on the 14th, a U.S. Navy spokesperson expressed the opinion that the Allied nations have now continued to organize a fleet in the Southwest Pacific, preparing for combat. The strength and precise location of this fleet are, of course, military secrets. In Australia and New Zealand, the Allied nations have another fleet under the command of Admiral Leary. The strength of this fleet cannot be announced either.</p>
<p>Canberra, 15th (Reuters) - The Australian Air Force issued a communiqué today stating that it is understood that in the air combat near New Cape St. George on Saturday, our losses included one aircraft destroyed on the ground and one shot down in aerial combat. The pilot of the downed aircraft is unharmed. One of our airmen was injured.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 16th (Haitong News Agency) - The Japanese military authorities in Medan, the capital of Sumatra, have ordered the 4,000 Dutch residents of the city not to leave their homes without permission, except for employees of municipal agencies. The Japanese military authorities have also ordered the destruction of all anti-Japanese, anti-German, and anti-Italian propaganda materials and photographs of the Dutch Queen. The municipal government was taken over by the Japanese military last Friday. Four hundred armed police officers, mostly Malay, are responsible for patrolling the streets of Medan. No Japanese citizens were freed when Medan was occupied, as all Japanese residents of the city had been transported by the Dutch to an unknown destination before the outbreak of hostilities.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Haitong News Agency) - It has been learned from this source that, at the outbreak of hostilities, the Dutch East Indies authorities detained 500 pro-Japanese Indonesians in a village 36 miles north of Bandung. They have now been released by the Japanese military. Since the end of the Java campaign, Japanese people have begun various activities in the Dutch East Indies. 130 prisoners in the Bandung area and 1,500 prisoners in the Surakarta area, as well as the water and electricity supply near Java, have all been cleared. Japanese ships have sailed to Batavia.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Haitong News Agency) - A war correspondent for the Asahi Shimbun reports from the Bandung front that the number of British, Australian, and American soldiers captured in Java has increased to 11,000.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Haitong News Agency) - A dispatch from Sumatra stated that the whereabouts of 150 Japanese residents in northern Sumatra remain unknown.

<p>London, 15th (Havas) - The newly appointed Secretary of State for War, Sir Grigg, took the opportunity of "Navy Week" to deliver a speech in Berkshire, stating that the crisis we are currently facing is even greater than the one we faced last year. This is obvious. The time has come for the British Empire to strive with all its resources in this decisive battle.

Regarding the fall of Singapore, we should refrain from making hasty judgments about this unfortunate event, as we have not yet received accurate information and do not know exactly what the situation is there.</p>

<h3 id="e7">Washington Newspapers Comment on Java Sea Battle <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Washington, 16th (Reuters) - Regarding the officially released details of the Java Sea battle at the end of last month, newspapers yesterday morning published them with large headlines and commentaries, calling it a major defeat for the Allied nations. The Washington Sunday Star wrote that this was Japan's most substantial victory. After this naval battle, Java was utterly defeated, and the reason for this is easy to understand. Furthermore, after this naval battle, the Japanese Navy has gained absolute control in the Southwest Pacific, which is also imaginable. Based on this, the defense of India and Australia will have to rely on air and land forces.</p>
<p>Washington, 15th (Havas) - The Star newspaper published an article today commenting on the setbacks suffered by the Allied navies in the Java Sea, stating that "the victory won by the Japanese Navy this time is truly decisive, because after this naval battle, Java was immediately overrun by Japanese forces. In short, since this naval battle, Japan has gained absolute naval control in the Southwest Pacific. Japan now has every reason to be proud. However, it is undeniable that the Allied joint fleet is inferior to the Japanese in terms of both tonnage and firepower. In short, unless we can surpass the enemy in warships, tanks, aircraft, and artillery one day, we cannot expect the Allied nations to win."</p>

<h3 id="e25">The Kachin People of Burma (Part 1) <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>In the northwest corner of Yunnan Province, in a section of undetermined border between China and Britain, the N'Mai Hka River (i.e., the Jiangxinpo) and the Mali Hka River wind their way into Burma. The two rivers converge and flow south into the sea, forming the Irrawaddy River that traverses Burma.</p>
<p>In the area where these two rivers meet, amidst towering mountains and dense forests, lives the strong and combative Kachin (Kaichin) ethnic group. They possess a written language and, relying on memory, pass down their tribal history orally from generation to generation. They can recount their history fluently. If written down, it would surely be an absurd and unbelievable history of Kachin colonization spanning tens of generations. The Kachin people primarily reside in this area, which, while bordering Burma, also has some of their kin scattered in the deep mountains of western Yunnan.</p>
<p>Let's begin with their basic necessities: food, clothing, and shelter. Kachin villages are scattered on high mountains or in dense forests, lacking streets. Houses are scattered and unconnected to prevent fires. The framework of the houses is entirely built with thick tree trunks, and the walls are made of bamboo fences. In these deep mountain forests, these materials are inexhaustible. The living space inside the house is about two or three feet above the ground, supported by wooden frames like a low building. Woven fine bamboo mats are laid on these wooden frames, and people live above while livestock are raised below. The foul air permeates the house, but the Kachin people are unperturbed, not finding it strange at all. Perhaps this is due to familiarity. The exterior of the house extends several feet, like a corridor, under which farm tools are piled, women husk rice, men relax, and it also serves as a shelter for cattle and sheep. From the outside, the house is rectangular, ranging in length from thirty to one hundred feet, depending on the owner's wealth. Such a large house can accommodate several small families—that is, several generations living together under a single family head.</p>
<p>Each house has two doors. It is said that the back door is for ghosts and spirits, so it remains closed year-round. When we visited Kachin residences, we entered through the front door, taking off our shoes and socks, walking barefoot, and climbing a clumsy ladder to step into the bamboo-matted house. The host was very welcoming and hospitable, and we received a very warm reception. The room had no furnishings, only low wooden stools, a few sleeping mats, several bamboo water containers, and incomplete iron pots. These were the decorations of the room. At one end of the house, we saw many hearths lined up. Parents, married sons, and unmarried sons and daughters each occupied a hearth. At night, everyone would lie down fully clothed next to their hearth. There is plenty of wood in the mountains, so they keep a fire burning all night, illuminating the dark corners of the house, but the thick smoke has stained the bamboo walls black.</p>
<p>A rectangular house can only last up to eight years before gradually collapsing. When they deem it uninhabitable, they set the old house on fire and rebuild a new one. They have plenty of manpower and materials, and they are rich in a spirit of cooperation. Once the owner has prepared all the wood, bamboo, and thatch for building a new house, the villagers all pitch in. In a short two days, they can build a brand new dwelling. No one demands wages. When the owner and their family move in, they prepare a lavish feast of wine and meat for everyone to enjoy, which is their reward.</p>
<p>While their living spaces are filthy, the Kachin people's clothing is even more appallingly dirty. Once a garment is put on, they never take it off to wash it. Day and night, it's the same piece of clothing—truly "clothing by day, bedding by night." Unless it becomes extremely tattered and falls off the body, they will never change into a new one. The Kachin people say that there is no water where they live. To fetch water for washing, one must traverse steep cliffs, and even if they obtain a little water, they will always use it as drinking water first.</p>
<p>Rice is their staple food. Apart from a few people who have copper pots and iron woks, most use bamboo tubes. When the bamboo tube is charred, the rice is cooked. They do not use bowls or chopsticks when eating. Instead, they use leaves to divide the cooked rice into several packets, according to the number of people. Without regard to guest or host, old or young, each person is given two packets—no more, no less. This clearly reflects a primitive era of equal distribution. The food inside the rice packets, except for the privileged, is often mixed with yams, beans, wheat, and so on. They do not eat leftover food. What they eat today must be prepared and cooked after waking up this morning.</p>
<p>Some say that Burma is an oriental matriarchal country because women can fight, defend themselves, and remain fearless in danger just like men. In reality, Burmese women have not achieved a special status; rather, they possess the ability to handle matters and work equally with men. Their ingenuity and skill even surpass those of men, so their power has obviously increased with the development of their abilities. Kachin women are no exception. They carry heavy loads on their backs, their bodies bent at a ninety-degree angle, their hands twirling small spindles, humming softly to comfort themselves. They wake up early in the morning to prepare three meals of rice and wheat, then carry long bamboo tubes up the mountain to fetch spring water. After finishing breakfast, they go into the deep forest to gather firewood, carrying large bundles back. They also weave. Two wooden sticks hold the warp threads taut, one tied to a stake in the ground, the other hanging from their own waist. They sit on the ground, straighten their legs, and slightly strain their backs, then slowly throw the shuttle with their hands. This primitive form of work can also weave various lovely patterns.</p>
<p>Young people also fall in love. The hearth inside the house is where they flirt. Parents do not forbid it, and there are opportunities to satisfy sexual desire next to the hearth. Women do not place much emphasis on chastity, but if they have a child, the man must pay a heavy fine. Although love is very free, marriage matters are still decided by the parents. When parents choose a match for their son, the first thing they do is obtain samples of the woman's cloth and handiwork to give to fortune-tellers to calculate if they are compatible. If they are, they secretly send someone to the woman's family to propose marriage and negotiate the bride price. Once both sides are satisfied, the wedding date is immediately set. On the wedding day, the bride sets off for the groom's house, accompanied by several female companions, carrying a large basket of dowry. Relatives and friends of the groom's family arrive, and a lavish feast is prepared. The bride climbs the wooden ladder and goes straight to the hall, where her mother-in-law comes out to welcome her and places a ring around her neck, signifying that she has been accepted as a member of the family. Then she meets the groom, and they sit together on a straw mat, drinking from the same cup, taking turns sipping, and smoking the same cigarette, taking turns puffing. Thus, the ceremony is completed.</p>
<p>The Kachin people's characteristic is their strength, combativeness, and determination to avenge any grievance. Revenge is their bounden duty, passed down through generations of grandparents, fathers, and sons. If a blood feud is established, it may take several generations to exact revenge.</p>

<h3 id="e27">German-Soviet Front: Situation Unchanged, Germans to Launch Large-Scale Offensive in May or June <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>German Supreme Headquarters, 16th - Huitong News Agency - Today's German military report stated that yesterday, enemy forces on the Kerch Peninsula launched a large-scale attack with multiple armored vehicles, but were ultimately repelled by German and Romanian forces. Soviet casualties were heavy. German fighter and destroyer squadrons destroyed 45 enemy aircraft, with the Germans losing only one aircraft. The 134th Saxon Infantry Division has repeatedly defeated enemy forces in recent weeks, achieving outstanding results. From the 13th to the 15th, Soviet forces on the Kerch Peninsula lost 136 tanks. Soviet forces attacking elsewhere were repelled by the German army after fierce fighting in heavy snow.</p>
<p>Moscow, 16th - Reuters - A semi-official source in Moscow announced today that Soviet forces are continuing to advance on the Southwestern Front (the area of Oryol, Kursk, and Kharkov). It is claimed that Soviet forces broke through German fortifications and recaptured several populated areas, currently facing fierce German resistance and continuing to advance. Soviet troops led by General Gobakov recaptured three large villages, seizing large quantities of ammunition and supplies. Soviet infantry advanced with active tank support. However, the Soviet communiqué at noon only stated that "there were no significant changes on the front last night."</p>
<p>Stockholm, 15th - Havas - The Dagens Nyheter has received a dispatch from its correspondent in Berlin stating that the German army will launch a large-scale offensive on the Eastern Front, likely in May or June. As for the front-line situation, there have been no changes in recent days. Both belligerents are currently preparing for a major battle in the future, so the battle situation is temporarily quiet. At least in the past week, the scope and strength of the Red Army's counterattacks have decreased compared to before, but this does not mean that the Red Army has stopped driving the German army out of its original positions. In fact, in the past few weeks, the Red Army, under the cover of heavy tanks, heavy artillery, and aircraft, attacked a German division a total of 91 times, but ultimately failed each time, retreating to their original positions after suffering heavy losses. Military observers here also said that the Soviet Union still has a large amount of manpower that can be mobilized, but the German army is satisfied with the winter warfare. The Red Army has suffered significant losses and will find it difficult to replenish their forces during the spring offensive. At this time, the Soviet Union's war effort seems to be concentrated on the Crimean Peninsula, especially on the Kerch Peninsula, concentrating a large number of troops in an attempt to break through the German lines in the Isthmus of Feodosia. In the central sector, the Red Army has made some progress in its attack on the city of Yelnaya. As for the Leningrad region in the north, the German army is constantly attacking, attempting to force the Red Army to abandon the west bank of the Volkhov River. Another German force is clearing out remnants of the enemy in the Lyuban district.</p>

Some may think that Turkey is still hesitant and indecisive, but in fact, Turkey's position has long been stated and has never wavered, and it will continue to pursue this policy without ambiguity. However, it is wrong for some people to think that the Turkish authorities will sell the flesh and blood of their children. Turkey is only willing to shed blood to defend its honor and independence.

<p>Havas from Stockholm, 15th: The *Zürcher Nachrichten* recently carried a dispatch from its London correspondent stating that people in London generally believe that cooperation between the Soviet Union and Britain and America is becoming increasingly close. However, the British press still insists that the Soviet government and the British and American governments should find a solution to all political and other issues. It is an undeniable fact that, to date, the Soviet Union remains aloof from all major Allied conferences. The Soviet government's cautious and even suspicious attitude is evident in this.

<p>Haitong News Agency from Stockholm, 16th: According to news from London, British people are now debating offensive military actions, or the spirit of offensive. While they no longer demand an attack on Germany this spring to avoid defeat, they demand the removal of the "difficulties of defense" and "small-scale raids" on the French coast to divert German troops on the Eastern Front. British political figures openly criticize the lack of cooperation among the Allies, saying that each country not cooperating with each other is tantamount to digging their own graves. A Swedish correspondent believes that the return of US Ambassador to Britain, Winant, to the United States is a prelude to the establishment of an agreement between the US and the Soviet Union. London hopes that Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union will eliminate misunderstandings, determine common war goals, and establish a joint combat plan to strive for ultimate victory.</p>

<h3 id="e42">French Concession Police Department's Measures to Ensure Security Increase in the Number and Duties of "Li Zheng", Identity Cards Issued to All Merchants and Residents in the Concession, Implementation of Terrorist Drills, Hope for Cooperation <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>According to the French Municipal Council, in order to cope with the needs of the current environment and to ensure the safety of residents within the concession, the French Police Department will implement the following measures in the short term:</p>
<p>Increase in "Li Zheng"</p>
<p>Increase in the number and duties of "Li Zheng": The "Li Zheng" established in 1938 were originally inspectors permanently stationed by the Police Department in various lanes. One of their main duties was to report to the police station those who possessed or traded weapons, sold opium drugs, or opened gambling venues, as well as all other acts that violated public order. The position of "Li Zheng" should, in principle, be drawn from the most respected landlords. There are currently 1,600 "Li Zheng" in the French Concession. Past experience has proven that these "Li Zheng" are of great assistance to administrative police, and because of the establishment of new lanes, the number of "Li Zheng" will be increased and their duties will be expanded.</p>
<p>Issuance of Identity Cards</p>
<p>Identity Cards: The French Police Department will issue identity cards. Everyone should apply for this identity card in order to prove the identity of merchants and residents within the concession and to prevent villains from lingering around.</p>
<p>Terrorist Drills</p>
<p>Terrorist Drills: In order to habituate residents to suppressing terrorism and bandits, and to train residents to automatically assist the police station, terrorist drills will be implemented. During the drills, designated residents in each lane should enthusiastically fulfill the orders they receive and follow the guidance of the police officers, so that their cooperation will be more effective in the event of an incident in the future.</p>
<p>All residents of the French Concession should understand that the above measures are necessary and are related to their own well-being. Therefore, they should cooperate to the best of their ability to maximize the effectiveness of these measures.</p>

One copy should be filled out when reporting. For re-exported foreign goods transported by inland river vessels, two copies of the re-export declaration should be filled out, and submitted together with the permit and unloading list. Foreign goods and native goods: For goods currently holding sales permits, native goods sales permits, sales sub-permits, and transport declarations, in addition to the names that should be provided as usual, the following sub-declarations for statistical purposes must be filled out: (A) Those holding sales permits and sales sub-permits must also fill out a C3 re-export declaration. (B) Those holding native goods sales permits and transport declarations should fill out D2 and D5 sub-declarations for statistical purposes as needed.

<p>Datong News Agency reported that when the foreign rice issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council to various rice shops is picked up from the warehouse, each bag has a shortage or surplus in weight. Therefore, the Rice and Grain Management Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council entrusts a foreign firm to send someone to weigh the rice and record the weight as a third party in order to show fairness. Recently, an incident of manipulation by the weigher occurred. The following is a record of the incident:</p>
<p>Designated to Pick Up Rice from Yuelai Warehouse</p>
<p>On the 5th of this month, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Management Committee allocated 20 bags of foreign rice to No. 4 branch of Father Lo's Public Welfare Company and designated them to pick up the rice from Yuelai Warehouse at No. 18, Tai'er Road. On the same day, the company sent an employee, Chen Jinkui, to the warehouse to pick up the rice.</p>
<p>Weigher Actually Reduced the Weight</p>
<p>At that time, the Pingzhun Foreign Firm on Beijing Road, which was entrusted by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Management Committee to handle the weighing, sent two employees, Shen Debiao and others, to handle the weighing at the warehouse. The total weight of the ten bags of rice was 4,016 pounds. The weigher actually reduced the weight to 3,357 pounds on the weighing slip. When the Public Welfare Company employee asked the reason for the reduced weight, the weighers Shen Debiao and others replied that they would be responsible for the weighing slip since it was signed by them. After the company picks up the rice, the price of the excess 659 pounds of foreign rice will be calculated and they will come to the store to collect it.</p>
<p>One of Two Weighers Arrested</p>
<p>Although Chen Jinkui did not approve of the weigher's behavior at that time, the weigher held the authority to weigh the rice and could not be offended. After transporting the rice to the store, he immediately reported the situation to the owner. The company authorities believed that this behavior was completely in violation of the law and reported it to the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Management Committee and the Songshan Road Police Station. Subsequently, the Songshan Road Police Station arrested one person, Shen Debiao. The other weigher had already fled upon hearing the news. After the incident, the Shanghai Municipal Council and the police station attached great importance to it and conducted a thorough investigation to see if this weigher, who claimed to be a notary, had committed similar fraud in the past, and imposed severe punishment to warn others.</p>
<p>Overcrowding During Rice Purchase Causes Woman to Faint</p>
<p>According to inquiries from Datong News Agency reporters, yesterday the Rice and Grain Management Committee continued to issue sales orders specifying the number of bags of corn to various rice shops. The rice shops paid at the Rice and Grain Office with the orders. The quantity allocated was exactly the same as that allocated last Monday. They can pick it up one after another from Lihe Warehouse at No. 195 Suzhou Road starting today to handle retail sales on the 20th (Friday). Yesterday was the day for the rice shops to release foreign rice, and the overcrowding was unprecedented. Even the police could not number and line up the crowds. According to Datong News Agency reporters who witnessed it yesterday morning, a young woman in the line for rice at the Tongchang Rice Shop at the intersection of Yuqiaqing Road (Baik Road) fainted from being overwhelmed. Two Chinese police officers stepped forward to help her up and lifted her body up and down for a long time before she recovered. There were even more cases of women and children being squeezed and injured. This tragic scene is truly pitiful.</p>

Zhou bravely arrested the bandits and finally captured one bandit near Yuqiaqing Road and recovered 84 yuan of stolen money. Mr. Zhou not only performed his duties to the best of his ability, but also set an example for other Self-Defense Force members.

It is hoped that other members will follow his example.</p>

Shen and others confessed that there were still accomplices hiding in the back room of No. 13 Wangzhi Road. The detectives then took the bandits there and arrested two more people, Shao Chenggen and Lu Shuxing, and confiscated a six-inch pistol. They were all taken back to the police station. It was learned that the bandits had committed dozens of robbery cases in the two concessions. They were ordered to be detained, investigated for stolen goods, and their accomplices were arrested before being dealt with according to law.</p>

<p>Zhu Jinghe, a woman residing at a certain number in Xinkang Lane, Baik Road, was at home at 2:30 PM on the 11th of this month when a young man knocked on the door and entered. He claimed to be from an American news agency and said that there was a telegram from Chongqing that had to be collected at the Lester School at No. 1320 Avenue Haig with a receipt. He showed a receipt and asked for 26.8 yuan. Zhu paid the amount as requested. When she went to the school to collect the telegram, she realized that she had been cheated. According to the school engineer, Moolick, there have been as many as seven people who have gone to the school to collect telegrams in the past two days. After learning of the above incident, the Police Department hopes that citizens will not be deceived when encountering such incidents and will report to the nearest police station.</p>

They only found two opium dens and nothing else. They then took the opium offenders and the evidence back to the police station for processing.</p>

<p>Sun A'yue, a Ningbo girl, 29 years old, with a bit of beauty, lived at No. 112, Shengsheng Lane, Qianjiatang, Huanlong Road, French Concession. Recently, due to the rising cost of living, she relied on her mother, Zhu, to make a living by washing clothes, which was not enough to maintain her. Therefore, she asked people everywhere to find her a job. A distant relative, Ding A'lin, accepted the girl's request.</p>
<p>Evil Intentions</p>
<p>He falsely claimed to introduce her to work as a maid. On the afternoon of the 2nd of last month, he lured the girl to the home of Gu Yang, a newspaper vendor (56 years old, from Suzhou), at No. 1, Lanxin Lane, Route Albert, and then took her to Changshu and sold her into a brothel at No. 17, Zhucaobang for 300 yuan, to engage in the life of a goddess. A'yue could not bear the abuse and secretly wrote to her mother on the 25th of last month. Sun Zhu went to Changshu to negotiate in person before she was able to redeem her for a considerable price and bring her back to Shanghai. However, she</p>
<p>Escaped Justice</p>
<p>and felt very unwilling to have been free of Ding A'lin and Gu Yang. She immediately reported the information to the French Police Station. Detective Li Yuyuan and Detective Guo Ruimin, who were handling the case, investigated and confirmed the facts. They arrested Gu Yang. Since Ding had already fled upon hearing the news, they arrested his wife, Ding Chen (40 years old, from Changshu, residing at No. 49, Lane 17, Rue des Soeurs), and took them both to the police station for detention. After the investigation is completed, they will file a public prosecution against the two defendants on the charge of obstructing family happiness.</p>

<p>At 3:10 PM yesterday, two robbers suddenly entered Room 203, China Reclamation Bank Building, No. 255 Beijing Road, each armed with a pistol. They robbed 30,000 yuan in cash and fled.</p>
<p>At around 10:00 AM yesterday, four bandits broke into No. 40 Haig Road, one armed with a pistol. As a result, they robbed 580 yuan in cash and two gold rings and fled without a trace.</p>
<p>Yu Xie, a young woman from Shaoxing residing at No. 311 Chengdu Road, 19 years old, was passing by the intersection of Route Mercier in the French Concession at around 5:00 PM yesterday when a young rogue in a suit and leather shoes, Hu Zhikun (31 years old, local), saw that she was wearing a gold ring and was heavily pregnant, making it difficult for her to walk. He rushed up and snatched her gold ring (worth over 200 yuan). She shouted for help, and pedestrians caught Hu and called the patrol officer, who detained him at the police station and immediately took him into custody. However, the stolen goods had been discarded by Hu on the way and could not be recovered.</p>

<p>The English *China Press* reported that the American Community Association of Shanghai announced yesterday morning that the Japanese military authorities have permitted the delivery of daily necessities to American prisoners of war in the Shanghai area. American prisoners of war and refugees from Wake Island are in particular need of warm clothing such as wool sweaters, underwear, socks, candy, canned food, and other useful food and clothing. These people are from temperate climates and are thinly dressed. After arriving in Shanghai, they are not warm enough. It is recalled that the last time the Japanese military authorities permitted the donation of daily necessities to American and British prisoners of war in Shanghai was during Christmas last year. Those currently detained in the Shanghai area include officers and soldiers of the American warship *Wake*, the American Marines stationed in Tianjin, the American garrison on Wake Island, and the officers and soldiers of the British warship *Petrel*, which resisted and sank in the Huangpu River.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Discussion of Bicycle License Consultation to Follow; Joint Tricycle Licenses; Position of the Public Works Department Regarding the Issuance of Joint Bicycle Licenses Remains Unclear <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, the Public Works Department of the International Settlement and the Chinese authorities are still awaiting a decision from the French Municipal Council regarding the proposed joint bicycle license for the three districts of the city. Competent observers believe that after the bicycle license matter is settled, the three parties will further discuss the possibility of using a joint tricycle license.</p>
<p>The French Municipal Council Has Yet to Express Itself</p>
<p>It is noted that when the proposal for a joint bicycle license was announced, the Chinese authorities and the Public Works Department had already reached a tentative agreement on a trial basis and signed an agreement. However, the use of this license requires the formal consent of the French authorities. Therefore, the matter was discussed with the French authorities. As of now, the French Municipal Council has not clarified its position on this matter, stating only that it is under detailed study.</p>
<p>Decision on Bicycle License Within the Week</p>
<p>However, a semi-official source said yesterday (the 15th) that the decision on the joint license method is expected to be announced this week. According to the proposed joint license method, bicycle owners only need to obtain a license from any one district and do not need to obtain separate licenses in the three districts, as the joint license is valid in the International Settlement, the French Concession, the Western District, or the Chinese area. If all current difficulties are resolved and the joint bicycle license is implemented, the three parties will study the issue of joint tricycle licenses. It is widely believed that this matter is extremely important, as tricycles still need to obtain separate licenses in the three districts, which is not only troublesome but also more costly in terms of license fees compared to the joint license method.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the spot Zhá Chì market dropped and then rose, as military notes turned from weak to firm. Because the old and new legal tender had been evened out, people's hearts were soft in the face of uncertainty. Speculative securities firms and Tianjin gangs bought in, and there was no shortage of sellers with high prices and real goods, causing two withdrawals of 18,000 yuan in Customs taels and then a retreat. From the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially suffered from the weakness of the previous Saturday. Under the competition between silver firms and cash firms, the opening was low at 850 yuan, at 17,300 yuan. Because the securities firms vigorously entered the market, it rose to 17,600 yuan. Chengji Shihe and the silver firms rose again, and sold back to 17,300 yuan. Shengyong Securities entered the market, and it was heard that military notes were rising. People's hearts turned better, and retail investors rushed to absorb them. The price actually flew up 750 yuan, breaking out of 18,000 yuan and reaching 18,050 yuan. Hongqing Yongshunyuan vigorously sold, retreating to 17,750 yuan. Tong Kang Yong, Decheng, and Shengyong rose again, reaching 18,250 yuan. Shengyong came out again, and Hesheng and another securities firm sold out. At noon, it retreated to 17,800 yuan. At noon, it closed at 17,950 yuan, a small increase of 200 yuan compared to the previous weekend. There was a difference of 950 yuan in half a day. The transaction was not prosperous. The large Xin Tong Hang of jewelry gold reduced the discount by 50 yuan per tael, hanging at 1,850 yuan, and reduced the intake by 200 yuan. Silver: 20 yuan. The black market selling price was 21 yuan, and the purchase price was within 20 yuan. Silver coins were 10 yuan and 5 cents each.</p>

<p>The over-the-counter market for public debt yesterday saw a decline in transactions due to people's hearts being confused. Market prices were still mixed. However, types Ding and Wu were in greater demand. Lemao sold type Jia because of the rush, and the trend was initially stable. Type Bing rose to 7 yuan and 4 cents, and type Wu rose to 5 yuan and 2 cents, not falling due to rumors. It is said that public debt loans can still be done, but they require quite a few acquaintances. It is also heard that people have already gone to Jinhua to receive interest. It is unclear if this is true. Xie Yuanyuan, Xinhua, Tongyi, Renchang, and Lianyi bought in, while Lemao, Hu Heji, Yiji, Yichang, Zhongfu, etc., supplied quite a bit, so market prices rose and fell unevenly. Except for type Jia, which fell by a relatively large amount of 8 cents, the rest fell only slightly by 2 cents. Type Wu rose by 4 cents. The outlook should be stable for a while. The transaction volume was about 300,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>

<p>The cloth market was weak in the morning and firm at noon, because actual sales were bleak, and stockholders were distracted, sometimes entering and sometimes exiting. There was a sharp drop at one point in the morning, but the closing price rebounded strongly because military notes rose. As a result, white cloth, coarse cloth, and twill rose by 1 yuan to 2 and a half yuan. Bleached and dyed printed cloth was flat. 16-pound coarse cloth, Shuangxiang brand was 165 yuan, Feihong brand was 137 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong coarse cloth was 83 yuan, 9-pound Wufu was 92 yuan, Sanba bleached cloth was 155 yuan, White Cat printed cloth was 120 yuan, White Cat hemp yarn was 145 yuan, 190 Taohua women's muslin was 210 yuan, No. 60 was 182 yuan and a half cents, Butterfly blue cloth was 175 yuan, Changshou plain fu silk was 5 yuan 3 corners and a half cents, Dapeng fine cloth was 134 yuan. More than 400 pieces were transacted on this street.</p>
<p>East cloth: Yesterday's market fell first and then rose, because people's hearts are trending upwards, and it has become easy to rise and difficult to fall. In the morning, the opening price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth new order was 1656 yuan, falling to 64 yuan. At that time, the buying wind was fierce again, gradually rising to 71 yuan at the close. The market later started to rise from 171 yuan and a half cents to 75 yuan at the close because of the strong appetite of those inside and outside the industry, a sharp increase of 6 yuan per piece compared to last week.

Colorful ball fine cloth was 150 yuan and 5 corners, Flying Fish Yanghe was 149 yuan and 5 corners, Trumpet Boy was 48 yuan and a half cents, Five Blessing Double Fish was 48 yuan, Baby fine cloth was 132 yuan, Double Fish Five Blessing oblique was 135 yuan, and Four Gentlemen Serge new order was 5 yuan 2 corners and 8 cents, and red new order was 4 yuan 9 corners and 7 cents, all were quite tight.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Yarn Market Spins <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is still in a spinning situation, because people's hearts are mediocre, and military notes are stable. The initial opening price of 20-count Shuangma factory order was 2,900 yuan, falling to 2,815 yuan. Later, due to profits, people patched up, and it gradually rebounded to 2,990 yuan.

<p>Yesterday's miscellaneous grain market has tended to level off and fall, because prices are too high, actual sales have gradually decreased, and there are quite a few people selling at high prices. Therefore, the market for soybeans, red beans, and kidney beans has fallen across the board by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. However, soybean cake is still active and sees an increase of 1 to 2 yuan. A total of more than 200 packages of Tianjin Jinyuan were sold, priced at 220 yuan. One carload of Linhuaiguan soybeans was priced at 209 yuan.

<p>Also, the Miscellaneous Grains Group of the Shanghai Rice, Wheat, Miscellaneous Grains, and Oil Cake Association was formally established yesterday. It is heard that the first thing to be done is to dredge the source of soybeans.</p>
<p>The leather market fell first and then rose. Initially, it fell by 3 to 5 yuan due to sluggish actual sales and floating households selling. Later, because wealthy households came to absorb them again, the market regained strength. As a result, it rose by about 2 yuan compared to the previous day. A total of more than 4,000 packages of Sanxin large package bran were sold, priced at 99 yuan to 105 yuan, and small package bran was 107 yuan, and orchid bran was 105 yuan.</p>

<p>Since the ban on the transport of national rice into the concession, the burden has stopped, and the rice stores have also closed their doors. Those who sell sell at 4 yuan and 8 cents per liter, still thinking it's a rare commodity. And there are treacherous rice stores that sold foreign rice yesterday, hard currency. Most people, because they did not receive notice in advance, temporarily wrote down the numbers and were forced to withdraw. However, most rice stores do not have this prank. The French Concession sells for about 400 yuan. The area west of Shanghai is cheaper because it is close to the suburbs, at 33 yuan per liter. The rice stores and miscellaneous grain shops, which are suffering the bitter situation of the Japanese, have all raised their inventory by more than double in a few days. There is no joy in the huge profits. It is no wonder that people covet it.</p>

<p>20% of the Sugar Payment Can Be Paid in National Currency</p>
<p>Recently, the sugar market has gradually fallen in price because military notes have eased slightly, about 20 to 30 yuan. At the same time, the sugar stocks of the cooperative have also softened, such as the coarse sand stock at 245 yuan to 47 yuan, a decrease of 10 yuan to 8 yuan, and the red sand stock at 234 yuan to 37 yuan, a decrease of more than 10 yuan. Yesterday, military notes reached a maximum of 6 yuan and 6 cents and a minimum of 6 yuan and 3 cents. The sugar allocated by the cooperative in March can be released one after another today and tomorrow. As for the sugar payment, 20% can be paid in national currency, converted into military notes at 4 yuan, 5 corners, and a half cents, and the remaining 80% must be paid entirely in military notes.</p>

<p>The cigarette market price is stable, because the financial storm has gradually subsided, speculative merchants are less active, and people's hearts are distracted and uncertain. The market is showing a spiral trend.

<p>New purchase prices of daily necessities emerge one after another, and the rising trend is endless. In the sound of rare goods and poor sales, the general market peddlers keep raising prices. The price of Gu Ben soap is 275 yuan per box, Huang Xiangmao soap is 240 yuan, Bai Xiangmao soap is 250 yuan, and Phoenix brand matches are 3,300 yuan, and Ship brand foreign candles are a high price of 180 yuan. Looking at the market outlook, there is still a possibility of rising prices.</p>

<h3 id="e70">The Lesson of the Shoe Shiner <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Mo</p>
<p>Walking along Henan Road, I saw two simple advertisements: "Shining shoes requires effort" and "No effort, no shine." My heartstrings were moved by them. Although making a living is so difficult these days, and the small matter of shining shoes shouldn't be handed over to others, I ended up supporting this advertisement, naturally sitting on the rattan chair waiting for customers. At this time, my feet were expecting a test of the effort he used!</p>
<p>Opened cans of shoe polish, empty ones, full ones, yellow ones, black ones, piled on one side of the stone steps. I carefully looked again at this advertisement with its sloppy handwriting. Besides the two tempting advertisements mentioned above, there were also a dozen lines of small print, saying, "Opened cans are no longer available, but I still have some in stock. If customers want to buy them, they will be sold at market price." This shows that even though shining shoes is a trivial matter, he also knows how to hoard goods, but he hasn't made it a rare commodity yet, and is willing to sell it at market price, which is much more charitable than the average hoarder.</p>
<p>He began shining my shoes. After washing with water and applying polish, he really used all his life's effort. He knew how to scrape away dirt and polish. Although he hadn't read many books, he discovered that Mozi's saying "Those who rely on their strength live, those who do not rely on their strength do not live" was his principle for survival. Indeed, the effort he put into shining shoes was more diligent than his peers, and he made a unique contribution to my leather shoes.</p>
<p>Three minutes, four cents. I began to doubt the value of a writer's words. I was sure that he couldn't survive without earning four cents per shine, so I started talking.</p>
<p>"Does it cost five cents to shine a pair of shoes?" He said it used to cost only two or three cents, but now it costs five cents. I was delighted that my words hadn't yet become detached from current social life, and I had hit the mark with my first guess. Next, I thought that even though he put in effort, his daily income was probably less than ten yuan, so I asked him how much he earned each day. "On a sunny day, I can make about twenty-some yuan, but on a rainy day, it's much less." Twenty-some yuan! This made me sigh at my own helplessness, and at the same time, it made me think that his emphasis on effort was truly reasonable. And even though everyone has strength, it was he who could contribute that strength to people's feet. He continued, saying that he had six mouths to feed at home, and his average monthly income was over four hundred yuan. His father used to work for a shipping company, but he lost his job two months ago and is now following in his son's footsteps. However, he lacks strength and doesn't have regular customers, so he can only earn six or seven yuan per day on average. These two numbers more clearly proved the value of his effort. I roughly calculated that their family's monthly income was six or seven hundred yuan at the moment. I couldn't help but sigh, admiring his courage to struggle for survival with all his might, and at the same time, becoming aware of my own future, with my heart and strength exhausted and my temples already graying. The times are urging people to "toil their muscles and bones and starve their bodies." Except for those who willingly give up, the shoe shiner's advertisement and Mozi's philosophy of strength should be passed down through the ages.</p>
<p>I felt ashamed in front of my shoes. Although you are shining, this shine is not the result of my effort. The shinier my shoes are, the deeper my laziness and sin are. One cannot be proud without self-reliance, and one cannot regenerate without self-reliance! The impression the shoe shiner left on me is deeply unforgettable, and the lesson of "self-reliance" came without any effort at all!</p>

<p>(2) Sorrow and Joy</p>
<p>But after Grandma Ye shouted loudly, she seemed to have lost consciousness again; although she sometimes opened her eyes, she didn't look at anyone. Mrs. Ye the Second said, "Sister-in-law, do you know? Weicheng is calling you. Weicheng is back. He is our treasure. He is very good, he is calling you, can you hear him? Mr. Huang's medicine will be ready soon, drink a small half bowl, and your illness will get better. Mothers shouldn't worry about their sons; sons shouldn't worry about their mothers; then everyone will get better. You said that next year, you must go to Shanghai and Suzhou with your son. Your son has grown up so much, he will definitely take you there. Sister-in-law, wake up, don't be so sleepy. Hee hee!"</p>
<p>Grandma Ye seemed to want to speak, but her tongue wouldn't obey her command. After letting her moisten her throat with ginseng soup, it still didn't work. Cuizhen brought in a little more than half a bowl of strained medicine. Weicheng took it in his hand, brought it to his mouth, and first tested the temperature, then tasted the medicine. He stood tremblingly in front of the bed and called out, "Mom, the medicine is here!" Mrs. Ye the Second helped to call out, "Sister-in-law, Weicheng is here to serve you medicine. Weicheng is your darling, he is so filial, and the medicine is like a magic pill, it will cure you if you drink it. Tomorrow, you will sit up and drink porridge. Now, open your mouth." Grandma Ye opened her mouth unnaturally, and everyone was happy. Magpie held a spoon, Cuizhen held the medicine bowl; the Second Aunt held a bowl of warm water that had been used to rinse the medicine, standing a little further back; Weicheng fed Grandma Ye one spoonful at a time. At first, three or four spoonfuls were okay, but later she couldn't take it, and it flowed from the corner of her mouth into her neck. Mrs. Ye the Second said, "Eat it later, don't rush." Weicheng fed her another spoonful of warm water, and it still flowed into her neck. The medicine bowl, warm water, and spoon were all mixed up on the dressing table, and Weicheng's sorrow came again, and he held his face and sobbed softly. (25)</p>

<h3 id="e72">Bamboo Clapper Ballads <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— Zefu</p>
<p>Bamboo clapper ballads, named because only bamboo clappers are used to control the beat during singing, and no other instruments are used. This type of ballad may have evolved from the lotus flower song, as lotus flower songs also use only bamboo clappers during singing, but the lyrics are more refined than those of lotus flower songs. This type of singing is popular in the areas of Hebei and Henan, but the singing in the two places is slightly different. The bamboo clappers used in Hebei consist of two bamboo clappers four inches long and one and a half inches wide, connected by a silk cord. The thumb supports the clappers between the two boards, and the clappers sound together. The songs are mostly biographical stories, compiled into lyrics, such as "Ant Fortune Telling," "Parrot Answering Questions," and "Names of Hundreds of Flowers." In Henan, in addition to the two large bamboo clappers supported by the left hand, the right hand also supports many small bamboo pieces strung together, commonly known as jiezi. There is also a gavel on the table, the same as other storytellers. The songs are mostly historical and fictional stories, with singing and dialogue, such as "Huarong Road," "Wu Song Fighting at the Inn," and "Pig Bajie Plowing the Earth." Occasionally, there are also songs of small tunes, such as "The Three Character Classic Advising Her Husband." At the beginning of the singing, there is an opening, and at the end, there is a closing. The tunes are divided into small tune and large tune. The small tune is singing allegro, and the large tune is singing largo. However, it is usually sung in allegro, so it is also called bamboo clapper quick ballad.</p>
<h3 id="e73">The Road to Life <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— By Du Yasheng, Illustrated by Jiang Dongliang</p>
<p>At first, seeing people fight over sesame cakes and steamed buns, although I didn't step up heroically to capture them alive, I always felt resentment towards their lack of "striving upwards"; gradually, I got used to it, and even seeing groups抢送货脚踏车 (i.e. groups rushing to deliver goods by bicycle - I can't quite translate this since it's a specific behavior) I could only let out a low sigh. At first, seeing a dead body in the alley, the words "white flour" (i.e. drugs) immediately surfaced in my mind, and sympathy arose from regret. Although sympathy is cheap for these "self-inflicted" cases, it wouldn't be denied. Yesterday, I personally saw a young man in his twenties collapse in an alley, his face pale, his bones emaciated, lightly calling out "Starving to death!" This was naturally not the effect of poison in the blood vessels, but rather because there was nothing for the stomach to absorb. When someone threw him a sesame cake, his greedy eyes only stared, unable to reach out and pick it up; in the end, he abandoned the food that could solve his "starving to death" and starved to death!</p>
<p>Being born as a human, besides the last resort of seeking death, the desire to live is above all else. Ruan Lingyu staked her life on "gossip is a fearful thing," and even when undergoing surgery, she shouted "I want to live!" However, how long can one survive by resorting to抢(i.e. snatching things)? The young man who was "starving to death" didn't even manage a kiss of the "delicious food" before him, most likely dying with his eyes unclosed.</p>
<p>Milling rice is a bitter task, with aching feet and back, being beaten and bleeding, but all of this is worth enduring, for no other reason than to live! From broken rice to corn flour, to red beans to sweet potatoes... still giving it our all, for no other reason than to live! Since rice produced within the country is not allowed to be transported into the concessions, rising before dawn to rush to Xujiahui, there is another new long snake (i.e. a long line), traveling long distances without considering it hardship, for no other reason than to live!</p>
<p>However, the road to life is so narrow, the cost of living is so high, the road to survival is like climbing on the edge of a knife, and falling down is indeed a bottomless abyss, and even after enduring a day, the knees and palms are covered in blood!</p>
<h3 id="e74">"Spring is Ours" <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— By Yiqing</p>
<p>'After I finished writing "Spring," the last time I put down my fountain pen, I turned around and looked around slightly tired, and the spring breeze came in from the window, gently brushing my cheeks, and the tiredness disappeared immediately. I knew that spring had arrived. I also remembered Shuying's words: Spring is ours...'</p>
<p>Mr. Ba said this in the preface to "Spring."</p>
<p>Indeed, it is spring now. In the gentle breeze of spring, I read the novel "Spring" (this is the third time reading it), and I also finished reading Mr. Hu Dao's adaptation of the play "Spring." Under my repeated heavy emotions, I pulled open the green gauze curtain and looked at the azure sky. I not only felt that this was spring, but also felt that there were many lively young people living in spring outside the sky.</p>
<p>Although spring has arrived, the sadness of winter still exists faintly. In "Spring," Hui and Shuying, the Juexin and Juemin brothers, are all struggling from the murderous winter, entrusting their fervent hopes to spring. Perhaps, the coldness of ice and the cold of snow suppress a fervent hope, even sacrificing it. Hui sacrificed so resentfully, and Juexin also holds a heart ready to sacrifice. Do they want to? No, it is the ice of winter, the snow of winter, that took away his and her heart and soul.</p>
<p>Spring is ultimately lovely. Having endured the difficulties and passed through winter, spring finally arrives. Look! Shuying and Juemin, etc., are warmed by the spring breeze and their young lives are growing.</p>
<p>"Spring" is on stage. These young drama partners, of course, also want to shout: "Spring is ours!"</p>
