<p>本報特稿</p>
<h3>緬甸的卡慶人</h3>
<p>在平時，卡慶人如遇到謀殺，故殺，誤殺等事情發生，雖然沒有司法來制裁，但村裏的組織，也極嚴密的，通常由高齡的村長出來處理，按照所犯情節的輕重，假定一個罰金，由兇手承認繳納。如果兇手沒有力量或者不願認繳，則此事的解決，非訴諸武力不可，雙方糾合了同黨，大規模地械鬭，不到雙方大仇已報，認爲滿意時，決不干休；甚至於本人的寃　未報，賷志以沒，則他的子孫，必世世代代報復下去。他們的貨物，像五穀，六畜等被人竊盜，抑或他們的妻女被引誘淫奔以及產私生等，也一律以同樣習慣，採取繳納罰金的辦法，來結束所犯之事，要不然，只好各恃武力，作爲對付了。當械鬭時，完全依賴各人的體力去爭取勝利，絕不以技巧去制服，所謂明人不做暗事，大家保持着君子的態度。</p>
<p>械鬭進行之日，憤怒激昂的　圍，騷動了整個村莊，假定甲村的人被殺死在乙村，則乙村的所有男女老幼，都是甲村的敵人，不管你對於這椿事情有無關係，如果狹路根逢，生命的危險，是要刻刻提防的。從前英國的遠征隊行經八莫和中國的邊境間，處罰了幾僩卡慶人，他們便認爲奇恥大辱，永遠印在每個人的心坎上，直到二十年後，又有一隊英國傳教師走過這個地方，他們便很嚴重地予以襲擊。他們出外時，必肩負長刀一把，從前還荷長矛，並用强弓毒矢，現在却很講究，有一枝好槍。他們還有鈾帽槍，　石槍，在奧　的山裏，會發生廣大的作用。</p>
<p>卡慶人非常好客，任何旅客們行經他們的山國裏，會獲到殷勤的款接，享受幾天溫暖的待遇，在周圍的村落　，可以不費一錢，得到膳食的供應，就是你情願送他們一點酬報，他們也堅決不受的。等到你遊歴完事，他們還可以持械保護，送你出境，殷殷惜別，重訂後會之期。</p>
<p>關於耕種，上慶人仍用原始方法，每年於早春季節，在密林中選擇一大塊地方，將所有的林木，悉數斫去，使這塊地方得與日光接觸，等到若干時日，便縱火焚去樹根，成爲一片焦原，用鋤攤平，然後播種，所謂刀耕火種，卡慶人始終認爲美善的。第二年仍在原地耕耘，但到了第三年，便認爲這裏已欠肥沃，必須另擇他處，砍伐林木。</p>
<p>和其他未開化的民族一樣，卡慶人度着多神敎階段的社會生活，他們認爲樹有樹鬼，山有山鬼，乃至蟲魚花草，亦莫不有鬼。鬼有掌握三十三天，十八層地獄和星辰日月的權能，鬼能降福，亦能降災，五穀是否豐收，六畜是否繁衍，都是鬼在作祟。他們認爲鬼的器量狹窄，如果不向他虔誠獻祭，他決不賜福，反之，倘使時時用牛羊供獻，那就一定祈福得福，求壽得壽了。與鬼溝通的人物，便是巫覡，他們在社會上有特殊地位，受到羣衆的敬仰。</p>
<p>卡慶人雖然過着原始生活，迷信神權，但他們個個都長得很結實，不怕艱苦，能適應環境，能和大自然奮鬥，就靠這幾點，他們在深山中世世代代生存下去。關於他們的人口，因散居各處，當然無法估計，不過照目前他們寄跡區域的廣大，這個民族的力量，是相當偉大的。據說在四十年前，美國浸禮會敎士漢森博士Dr.O.H.Hanson　曾用羅馬字拚成卡慶話，創成一種卡慶文字，在這廣　的山區裏，巳有若干靑年人，逐漸在利用這種新的文字了。</p>
<p>毘鄰卡慶在邊疆最强大有勢力的民族，要算栗粟人了。這兩大民族在血統上同屬蒙古種，從他們的老家西藏，慢慢地向南遷移而來。雲南的怒山一帶，也有栗粟的部落，這是和緬甸的撣族一樣，分佈於中國，緬甸和泰國這些地方。這幾個强大民族，過着原始生活，綿延數千百年而始終具有鬥爭的性格，斷是不可輕侮的。</p>

<p>事變前，每一僧人每日誦經之收入，約爲大洋八角，嗣後屢經增漲，去年已高至三倍，仍因不敷開支，乃改爲每名三元，規模較大之廟字或尙不止此數。且此係指上門佛事，在大雄實殿或彌勒殿上誦經而言，若往施主家中禮懺，其價尙須超出。誦經人數多寡不拘，至少約爲七名，多則二十餘，甚至四十八不等；其中一係主僧，禮拜時擔任領班工作，其服飾與普通僧人略異。侍應衆僧之香伙夫役，每日代價與僧一名相同。</p>
<p>冬夏淡月</p>
<p>寺院佛事隨節季而異，一年十二個月中以春秋兩季爲旺月，每日燭火輝煌，梵唱喧耳，大殿之上，欣欣向榮。夏月汗流夾背，臘冬人事倥惚，施主抗　走俗，無暇登殿禮佛，寺院收人自然清淡矣。「在家人」借用寺院超度亡魂，追荐祖先而外，冥壽追慶，設壇建　等事，亦均以此爲大本營：至若佛誕開光，講經受戒，老僧圓寂，住持接事等等典禮，無論十方大叢林，一隅小寺院以資源所在，咸鄭重將事，不容忽視。</p>
<p>服裝昂貴</p>
<p>綺羅綢緞，呢絨嗶嘰，固非僧人所需，但灰黑色之寬袖大袍，長統布襪，僧　僧帽，缺一不可。照目下市價，老布售至二元餘一尺，一襲僧袍連工帶料，據聞非四五十元不辦，長統布夾襪約六七元一雙，雙　布脊玄色鞋佳者亦須三十餘元，襯裹之衫襖等尙未計算在內。一切蔽體所需，槪由僧人自備。邇來小寺院中之普通師父，其平均收入　約為三十至四十元之間，雖每日有兩稀一乾之淡粥飯可吃，然其生活之淸苦亦可想見矣。</p>
<p>成佛不易</p>
<p>此所謂「成佛」，非指和尙成佛，乃廟中所供佛像之山來處也。寺院中之大小佛像，咸由「成佛處」—新北鬥城內有之－承造，由整塊之香椿木雕塑而成。目下木料飛漲，來源斷絕，金價瘋狂，人工倍增，　論大佛，即相當之小菩　一尊，亦非數百金不辦。若仰光巨佛，勢將傾全城之力矣·佛說世上衆生，一切皆苦惱，善哉　　！</p>

<h3>街頭巷尾</h3>
<p>— 余何言</p>
<p>西方的晚霞未全褪，一鈎眉月，半遮半掩，盤桓於獵戶星座，好似在臨窗憑眺着；大犬座的天狼星，一道一道的光芒，搖紅曳綠，閃爍在她的身畔，正不啻御了一枚十克拉的金剛鑽實石戒。</p>
<p>馬路上一對對路燈，如今是形單影隻。有許多地方，左一燈，右一燈，於冷靜中顯出波浪紋的光綫。正爲了節省電力，好讓那天琴星座的織女，不舍　夜，開足馬力，紡紗織布，到人間賣一百七八十元一疋的細布，空前好價錢。</p>
<p>「哈哈！你爲什麼緊跟着我，戀戀不捨？」</p>
<p>「啊！先生！正爲了米價貴，老闆買不着米吃，把職工解散了。我旣是回不得家鄕，見不得爹娘，顧不得妻房，只好流浪，在街頭，幹那求人的生涯。可憐我，從早晨直餓到黃昏，六穀餅沒有上過口，趕搬塲倒已有了三四次。」</p>
<p>「喂！這是一隻麻袋，裏面不知裝的是甚麽東西？」</p>
<p>「我猜想袋中裝的是米，必爲了超過零售數量，惟恐犯禁吃官司，所以匆匆忙忙丢了就跑走。」</p>
<p>「不！爲什麼是黑沉沉的一大堆，我猜想是後門貨的煤球，恐怕有人追上來，暫時躱風頭。」</p>
<p>「不管他是米是煤，我與你背了走，這正是天賜黃金，串一齣羅夢拾金！」</p>
<p>「啊！呸！」原來是個壁挺的，眞正觸「煤頭」！</p>
<p>「不要管他，他也是時代的犧牲者，我替他念一遍往生咒，祝他往生西方極樂世界，不要再到人世來受苦。」</p>
<p>「咦！他生活纔是安定了，人世間的桎梏，不期然而得着解放。」</p>
<p>一條很潔凈的巷尾，水泥鋼筋的洋房，縷縷燈光，從那窗帘中透露到外面，室中人語，隨着出墻來。</p>
<p>「以前吃飯，最是容易不過事，如今吃飯是難事！」</p>
<p>「不，太太！府上的老爺不會無辦法，某先生不是米業中的大老闆，與老爺很是要好。」</p>
<p>「是的，究竟搬運要費事，你去關照廚房中的阿福，明天買小菜，務必買條牛肺來，餵給阿黃去吃。」</p>
<p>「你以前好駡人猪玀，如今你吃的，正是以前的猪食，這叫做駡人的現世報。」</p>
<p>「哈！你不要挖苦，我如今投機囤積，發了橫財，珍珠用斗量，麥麩黃金屑，煮了充飯吃，你想，豈不是快哉快哉！」</p>
<p>「喂！留心！不要在黑暗中逢着巡海夜叉，羅刹小鬼，崑崙么麽，將你肩負的東西刦了去。」</p>
<p>「咳，不要緊，錢可通神，臨時我自有妙計。」</p>
<p>「黯淡的燈光下，有兩位老者　　而來，嘴裏嘰哩咕嚕，不知說些怎麼，但聽得：</p>
<p>「眞所謂天何言哉，天何言哉！這叫做人焉廋哉！人焉廋哉！」</p>
<p>「宵禁已到了，不久的時光，就得重覩光明，方纔是洋洋乎得其所哉？洸洸乎　哉樂哉！」</p>

<h3>香蕉（五）</h3>
<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>在五十多年以前，美國有個著名的「水菓聯合公司」，－水菓大王－用它豐厚的金錢勢力，强大的政治手腕，在中美洲和西印度羣島上，有計劃的，按步就班的栽培香蕉：這些一向是貧瘠而黃瘧病熱病猖獗的區域，到現在反變成非常富庶的地方了！只是哥斯大利加一個那麽小的國，就擁有香蕉田二萬三千公畝，每年約出產香蕉一千二百萬軸！至於英屬的牙買加島，每年也可出產一千五百萬軸，於是南美各國也羣起效尤，擅香山和菲律濱的出產量也是蒸蒸日上，不知道我國閩粵二省的香蕉栽培家也會努力的急起直追沒有！</p>
<p>香蕉的化學成分是：水佔百分之七十六，炭水化合物－糖澱紛－佔二十二，蛋白質佔一又十分之三，脂肪佔小數點六，維他命和礦物質等佔小數點八。世界上消費香蕉最多的國家是美國，每年要吃四千五百多萬軸：其次是英國，每年要吃一千二百軸；旁的國家則瞠乎後矣。……</p>
<h3>經濟樷談</h3>
<p>— 馮柳</p>
<p>余嘗兩談金剛石，竊疑金剛石之得名，與佛經中所稱之金剛有關，因欲求其迹，以相引證。及讀六朝宋書，天竺迦毘黎國於元嘉五年　金剛指環，摩勒金環諸實物，時爲民國紀元前一四八四年，（西　四二八年）。七年，復有呵羅單國　使　金剛指環。指環即今之戒指，余前已言之，自西南諸國傳入，蓋當時西南諸國王中頗有以戒指作印信之用，固有類於今之印戒。及讀隋書，波斯國出火齊金剛。火齊狀如雲母，色如紫金，有光曜，別之則蟬翼，積之則如紗穀之重沓也。但金剛之爲何狀書未之詳。唐書天竺國乃有金剛形狀之記載，謂似紫石英，百鍊不銷，可以切玉。新唐書扶南國傳，亦謂出金剛，類紫石英，生水底石上，人沒水取之，可以刻玉，扣以　角，乃　。即所謂羚羊角能碎金剛石是也。又稱拂　國有夜光璧，明月珠，不知可是金鋼石一流珍物。</p>
<p>夫如史書所述，則金剛之爲金剛石無疑。叉求諸佛書，則妙法華蓮經中，亦將金剛列於諸珍寶中；叉化作八萬四千衆寶蓮華中，謂以閻浮檀金爲　，白銀爲葉，而以金剛爲鬚。鬚者花蕊也，以金剛作蕊，取其顆粒相類也。則釋迦牟尼佛時已知有金剛之爲物，並知其爲珍貴之品，故以喩經義之不可破壤，之爲寶中之寶。近頃又讀江味農居士，所著金剛般若波羅密經講義，（係得蔣竹莊居士所惠贈）　（未完）</p>

<h3>各國產影業公司　開始辦理結束</h3>
<p>— 太虛</p>
<p>膠片存底已罄！</p>
<p>去年十二月八日後，各種事業都發生嚴重影響。電影界最大的問題，當然是膠片。當時上海膠片的存底倒底有多少，一時無法統計。因爲各公司自身都略有存貨，小囤戶手中也稍有「積蓄」，並且據一般人預料，日本膠片或許也能運到上海來。所以各公司的拍片工作，始終沒有停頓過，就是對於每一部新片的用片，儘量節省。　如每一部片子的長度，從前都在一萬尺左右，改爲九千尺左右；NG儘可能减少，有的公司當局限令導演每一部片子祇能用片一萬二千尺。爲了延長國產電影的生命，像從前那樣每一部片于的　片量超出數萬尺者，實在是不應該再發見的浪費。</p>
<p>國產電影事業雖然是這樣慘淡經營，膠片用一尺少一尺是鐵的事實，前月份起，上海各影片公司每月的產片量限爲六部。分配的比例是：藝華一部，國華一部，國聯（即新華　新　成）三部。事實上那時膠片存底已如食米一樣的在减少了。據昨天得到的消息，如果沒有新的轉機，今後國產雷影勢必全部停頓。</p>
<p>國聯公司除了未完的幾部作品加緊結束外，岳　的「神秘的女郎」佈景已經搭好，亦於昨天拆台」。藝華公司也祇有三部未完成的作品－「淚洒想思地」「鴛鴦淚」「學府風光」在繼續工作，「大飯店」已拍的部份，決意犧牲了。金星有一部「出籠貨」「亂世風光」。國華因周　騎脚踏車傷腿，「林黛玉」也沒有動手。據預料，各公司這幾部最後影片，可維持全滬首輪影院二三個月之用。</p>
<p>公司停頓之後，全上海近千的從　　的恐慌是可以想見的。唯一的出路，是濱話劇。幸　最近話劇的空氣尙稱濃厚，個別在組織中的已有好幾個團體，可是覓地盤也是相當困難，所以，有幾個團體或許要向外埠發展。－這新的發展，在二個月之後當可以有詳細情形　吿。</p>
<p>現在在公演的話劇團體，計：　斐的美藝劇團，卡爾登的藝術劇社，紅寶的未名劇社，即將蘭心公演「殉情」的第八藝術劇團本來是短期性質的，不過經此劇變，因之作長期公演也說不定。美藝與　斐的合同本來至本月底為止，最近有與姚克合作，打入蘭心之意，現在不知有何變化，一時也難能預料。</p>
<p>除了上述的幾處地盤可演話劇之外，新的塲所似乎也不容易獲得，不過據電影界有關係的人士表示，大上海與滬光兩戲院，無論在設備上及交通上，是兩所理想的話劇院，這估計不免言之過早，但電影院改爲括劇院本來是最輕而易舉的。在三月之後，上海的情形勢必不是現在所能　測的。</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（二）悲與喜</p>
<p>「衆非成是」，大家安慰維　，說葉大太太經過林紹邦打了一針，好多了，剛才有些氣喘，現在氣喘倒平了些。　珍紅着眼皮，把一　籐椅子端過來，讓維城半坐半躺，朝葉大太太望着。維城像是出了門回來，做了夢醒來，問吃了藥片沒有，吃了藥水沒，葉二太太道：「有　珍在這裏，一個人抵得三四個人伺候的，你放心。」</p>
<p>厲又　的夫人也來了，大姑奶奶　性帶了她最小的一孩子來了，前村後宅，都有人來探病，都說葉大太太做人是怎麽好。到吃晚飯的時候，維城還是說肚子不餓，家裏人都像不准維城不饑，逼着他吃，他只喝了一　稀薄的粥。在房裏，多點了幾臺燈，明晃晃的。照理，昨天晚上不　的人，今天晚上都該輪到休　；但是葉二太太，從個這不同不相為謀的聲生嘴裏，知道今天晚上是最緊要關頭，說：大嫂過了今晚，一定好起來。」她在無形中，　托出今天晚上，大家當心看護着，別疏忽了。維城他始終把一塊石頭壓在心頭　的，他　然回頭，間：「舉珍姐呢？」葉二太太道。「　珍，她去了。她也是一可憐的孩子，她舅舅費長河，那能和厲家舅舅比。她要不回到舅舅家去，什麽謠言，都會造　的。她走了。」</p>
<h3>又是一個跳樓的人</h3>
<p>— 韓輔芳</p>
<p>最近跳樓的，猛　電桿木的，服毒的……的「故事」實在不能算少了。考其原因，無非是逼於生活。跳樓的如此，猛撞電桿木的服毒的也是如此。</p>
<p>「惻隱之心人皆有之。」因此而嗟吁涕洟者確也不在少數。然而有着「吾與爾猶彼也」乏感者更佔其大半。鳴呼傷哉！</p>
<p>友人來訪，談了油米以後，又提起了關於自殺的事來了。友人有聲有色的講述一個跳樓的故事：「一個年靑的穿着短布衫的人，從大樓上跳下來，着地的時候，就死了。恐怕因跌得很痛的緣故，道死人的腿痙攀着而舉得很高。「友人在講完了以後，又鄭重的加上一個自殺者的身分的說明：「據說死人的長袍子，直貢呢鞋子，都脫在樓上哩。」自殺的故事聽得多了，也覺得無所謂，但最後的一個說明，不由你「無感於中」了。</p>
<p>自殺本不是上策，自殺而怕出　，將衣帽之類藏匿起來，使人不辨眞相，則更是懦怯而糊塗了。</p>
<p>「死要面子活受罪。」這是一個很好的俗諺。然而能夠以此警　，却不見多。這個跳樓的也何嘗不是如此。好像自殺的只局限於藍布短衫之流，假使穿了長袍子而自殺，那實在有礙體面。</p>
<p>自殺據說要有勇氣，不然是「死」不成的。然而這勇氣是只限於「死」的一剎那。至於穿袍子而自殺的勇氣是例外了，而希望有拿「死」的勇氣去移植到「生」的勇氣上時，那更談不上了</p>
<p>自殺決不是上策，希望將自殺的人，好自爲之！</p>
<p>游藝雜談</p>
<h3>雙黃</h3>
<p>— 澤夫</p>
<p>雙簧相傳始於黃福臣。黃為　同聞人，面目奇醜，又跛一足。初亦說書之流，能以一人學作各種人物動態，故名雙黃。其後始分爲二人，學作一人。（見李斐叔梅邊雜憶）或謂黃乃北京票友，與弟同演此戲，故稱變黃。（見慶五京津間之花茶館）按今存百本張雙黃鈔本二種，內一種有云：「我們學的是故去的生意人黃輔臣，人都稱他是黃老太。」則黃福臣似應作黃輔臣。此種說唱，與相聲性質相同，專以博人笑樂爲主。惟相聲係二人對口，雙黃則一坐於前，一隱於後，坐者爲丑角，隱者爲正角。正角在後談笑歌唱，丑角在前隨聲表演，指手畫脚，一如己所說唱者。然演至中途，正角往往故作打　，使丑角不能表演，以便更換他　節目。故一塲之中，忽而說笑，忽而歌唱，全無情節可言，故事足述。演時除醒木外，別無他物；惟歌唱之時，偶亦由正角加彈絃子，以助節奏去爾。</p>
<h3>售貨知識</h3>
<p>— 國瑞</p>
<p>咖啡室的侍役，問你奶粉裏要不要放一只雞蛋，你差不多想也不想，便說「不要」。但是經創製「準售貨術語」的凱庫維萊（ELmer　Wheeler）訓練的店員，就每雙手拿起一只蛋，問你要一只還是兩只。那時你差不多不經考慮，便對他說「一只」，收銀機因此就多紀錄一個額外的　幣了。維萊將整百這類有利的對話供給添油站，飯店，百貨店和頸鍊店的主人，使他在實用心理學史上出了名。</p>
<p>「不要問人要不要，」維萊說：「問他要那一個。」永遠不要給顧客有機會去決定買不　；不要提出他容易答「不」的問題。到Brooklyn埠的某一個冷飲室喝可口可樂的人，侍役總問他們要大瓶或要小瓶；很少人要大的。經過維萊的測騐，以後侍役只問「大瓶？」每五次中的兩次果然是大瓶了</p>
<p>於是，在十多年前，便產生維萊的新職業－代擬銷售貨物最生效的語句。當維萊和他的屬員工作時，他們不立即便提出預備好的口號。他們費了一長時間去聆聽，紀錄和修改。</p>
<p>維萊的活動不限於　　旁。他勸吿洗擦工人帶備肥皂毛巾人屋，未觸動像具前，先請問甚麽地方可以洗手。照他的提議，洗衣商吩咐所有女店夥，不論有沒有結過婚，都自稱某某「夫人」。他又勸吿眞空洗擦　的推銷員，一進門內，先找着雀。狗和孩童。如果找到一隻金絲雀，推銷員的「標準術語」是「牠會唱嗎？」如果那裏有狗，他要問牠的名；如果是孩子，便問他的名字和年歲。有一個推銷員使百分之九十二門上掛着「營求者與乞丐莫入」木牌的人家買他的洗擦機，就是用這方法。一次維萊偶然吿訴狗主人，「防屋內犬」的木牌不如「提防餓犬」來得有效。　（節譯「文摘」）</p>

<h3>Japanese Occupy Entire Timor Island, Intensifying Encirclement of Australia</h3>
<p>Allied News Agency, Eighteenth, from a certain Japanese base: According to front-line reports, Japanese forces completely occupied Portuguese Timor Island on the 12th of this month.  The remaining Allied forces have been completely cleared out.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, Eighteenth: Japanese naval forces are currently moving towards Timor Island and New Guinea. Military observers in London believe that the purpose of the Japanese troop movement is to completely occupy Timor and New Guinea, in order to block the sea from Timor to Darwin and isolate New Guinea from the Torres Strait off the coast of Queensland, Australia. This is the most necessary step for attacking Australia.</p>
<p>Reuters, Wellington, Nineteenth: Before the secret meeting of the New Zealand Parliament, Prime Minister Fraser delivered a speech, emphatically stating that the danger of a Japanese invasion of Fiji has intensified. It is said that the Allies cannot afford the slightest mistake at this stage. Maintaining New Zealand and Australia as bases for offensive and defensive operations, and as important communication points for traffic to the United States, is a crucial point of the Allies' general strategy. The Allies must make enormous efforts to take the initiative and launch offensives. The British and American governments have promised to provide large-scale assistance to New Zealand, and various forms of aid are already on their way.</p>
<p>Active Air Forces on Both Sides</p>
<p>Reuters, Canberra, Nineteenth: Australian Prime Minister Curtin announced in a communique today that the Australian Air Force re-attacked Rabaul on Wednesday during the day and conducted reconnaissance flights over New Britain and other areas. Japanese aircraft also conducted reconnaissance flights over Papua and New Guinea. On Wednesday afternoon, Japanese aircraft reconnoitered an island near Cape York (Queensland). The Japanese aircraft were divided into two teams, reconnoitering for fifteen minutes without attacking. The alert was lifted one hour later. Shortly after the reconnaissance, one team of Japanese aircraft attacked nearby ships. Yesterday afternoon, Australian aircraft re-attacked the Kupang airfield, dropping a large number of bombs. They encountered heavy anti-aircraft fire at the time.</p>
<p>Reuters, Melbourne, Nineteenth: Australian Prime Minister Curtin announced in a communique that Port Moresby was attacked again this morning by Japanese heavy bombers for about half an hour. The targets were port facilities and ships.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, Nineteenth: Australian broadcasts received here stated that Japanese aircraft attacked Darwin Harbor again this morning.</p>
<p>Reuters, Canberra, Nineteenth: Australian Minister of Defence Ford announced today that the coastal artillery of a certain port on the northern coast of Australia fired on a fishing boat that did not respond to ordinary signals. The boat was damaged and three crew members were killed.</p>
<h3>Macarthur's Authority Clarified: Responsible for Implementing Supreme Strategy</h3>
<p>Reuters, Canberra, Nineteenth: It is reported that General MacArthur, as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Australia, is responsible for implementing the supreme strategy. The Australian army is still commanded by Australians, but is under MacArthur's command and maintains close contact with the Allied forces. Lieutenant General Brett will command the Allied air forces. The Australian Air Force is still commanded by Australian officers, but is under Brett's command.</p>
<p>Cable from Chongqing, Nineteenth: General MacArthur has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in Australia and New Zealand. Chairman Chiang telegraphed his congratulations on the 19th. The original cable read: "It is with great pleasure that I learn of Your Excellency's appointment as Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in Australia and New Zealand. I am confident that with Your Excellency's skilled strategy, you will complete a chapter in the great cause of humanity. I hereby send my congratulations."</p>
<p>Huitong News Agency, Stockholm, Nineteenth: According to news from London received here, opinions in London are divided on the appointment of General MacArthur, Commander of the American Forces in the Philippines, as Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific. From a military standpoint, this matter is welcomed by all parties, as the United States has now decided to take action. Military correspondents in London newspapers hope that MacArthur can repel the Japanese offensive against Australia. "Daily Mail," "Daily Express," "News Chronicle," and "Daily Telegraph" are vigorously promoting MacArthur to the British people as a capable military strategist, and believe that MacArthur's new appointment is sufficient to show that the United States and Britain will launch an offensive in the near future. This is the only significance of the appointment of an American general as Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific. MacArthur's new appointment is in response to Australia's special request, and proves that the connection between Australia and the British Empire is becoming increasingly loose. After MacArthur takes office as commander-in-chief, his work will be far from easy. The work in the Southwest Pacific is ten thousand times more difficult than in the Philippines, because the army in the Philippines was organized by MacArthur himself, while the Australian military, after repeated defeats, must be reorganized.</p>

The vehicles are to be delivered in four batches. It is generally believed that these vehicles will be transported from India to Chongqing. Koo is also trying to continue purchasing tanks and chemical warfare equipment.</p>
<p>Reuters, Sydney, Nineteenth: All parts of Australia are enthusiastically welcoming General MacArthur's transfer to the position of Supreme Commander in the Southwest Pacific. The Sydney Sun reports, "The MacArthur of the Philippines" has come to lead the military. Australians welcome him with the utmost sincerity. In addition, from government officials to ordinary citizens, everyone believes that General MacArthur will certainly live up to expectations.</p>
<p>Huitong News Agency, Berlin, Nineteenth: Today's "Der Angriff" commented on MacArthur's appointment as Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in Australia, saying that MacArthur's safe arrival in Australia has long been cited by American newspapers as a victory. The "Abendzeitung" believes that President Roosevelt's appointment of MacArthur as Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in Australia is intended to prevent Australia from reaching a peaceful understanding with Japan.</p>
<h3>Indian Action Committee Discusses Political Situation; Considers Appointment of British Prime Minister's Envoy to India as a Cause for Joy</h3>
<p>Reuters, New Delhi, Nineteenth: The Indian Congress Action Committee held a meeting in Wardha to discuss the political situation. It has adjourned temporarily after two days. After Sir Stafford Cripps, the British Lord Privy Seal, arrives, it will reconvene in New Delhi to study the specific proposals that Cripps may present, and then express its attitude. Before this, it will remain silent after discussions with other political groups, so as not to hinder negotiations. However, it considers the appointment of Cripps as a cause for joy.</p>
<h3>Change of Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union; Tatekawa Scheduled to Return Home</h3>

<h3>Remains of China National Aviation Corporation Plane Crash Victims Have Been Buried</h3>

Knox is currently in New York inspecting port facilities and examining the French liner "Normandie," which recently caught fire and capsized. He stated that the United States' coast guard patrols would be greatly strengthened, and the U.S. Air Force would participate in this activity. He also instructed shipowners sailing along the Atlantic coast to take strict protective measures. Knox also stated that most ship losses occurred at night, so ships should try to avoid entering coastal ports at night. However, ships traveling south that cannot avoid entering ports must extinguish all lights. Shipowners who do not comply with this rule will have their licenses revoked. Knox also proposed a precautionary measure, namely, implementing light controls in coastal ports, so that the outlines of ships do not appear against a bright background, making them visible to the enemy. He concluded, "We do not want to lose another ship."</p>

<h3>Turkish President's Speech Expresses Strict Neutrality</h3>
<p>Havas, Istanbul, Eighteenth: Turkish President İsmet İnönü delivered an important speech today in Smyrna, strongly stating that Turkey wishes to adhere strictly to neutrality and is determined to defend the motherland against any attack. He said, "To this day, no country is unaffected by the war. The number of belligerent countries is increasing daily, accounting for the majority of the world's countries. Only a small number of countries remain outside the conflict, Turkey being one of them. But we are still always concerned about suffering the consequences of war. The current international situation clearly needs to be studied from this perspective. Our country's foreign policy has long been declared to the outside world. Because we have treaty relations with both sides of the belligerents, we faithfully fulfill any treaty we have signed, without distinction. However, it is extremely difficult to adopt an impartial and friendly policy towards all countries during wartime. The government, with the trust of the National Assembly, is now promoting this policy with a serious and fair attitude. At present, we have almost no problems that would drag us into the vortex of war. Looking at the sky, it is clear and blue, without clouds. But we must still take all measures, closely monitor the future development of the current war, and never be negligent. We are prepared to defend the motherland. Since the outbreak of the Great War, the whole country has entered a state of mobilization. The country has never been as well prepared as it is today. In today's world, Turkey is truly the most fortunate country, so the government's adoption of some restrictive measures has been accepted by the Turkish people. We are now doing everything we can to keep our country out of the conflict. If other countries forcibly impose war on us, then for the sake of honor and dignity, we have no choice but to rise up and defend ourselves. The current war may be prolonged, but in any case, Turkey will become a great power after the war."</p>

<h3>British Admiralty Announces Expansion of Prohibited Navigation Zones; French West Coast Included; Three American Ships Sunk in the Atlantic</h3>
<p>Havas, London, Eighteenth: The Admiralty recently issued a communique announcing the expansion of prohibited navigation zones in the Atlantic. The scope is wider than that announced on November 1, 1940. Ships entering the prohibited area are responsible for their own risks. The newly promulgated prohibited navigation zone extends from south of Brest, France, passing "Bishop Rock," then west to 240 miles, then south to 200 miles, then east to 20 miles off the Spanish coast, then north along the Spanish coast to reach the French coast.</p>
<p>Havas, New York, Eighteenth: According to semi-official news from a certain port on the Atlantic, a U.S. ordinary tonnage merchant ship was attacked by three enemy submarines on the morning of the 15th of this month.

The remaining 33 were rescued and have arrived at a certain port in the United States. At the same time, according to news from Washington in the afternoon, the Navy Department announced that two more U.S. merchant ships were torpedoed and sunk off the Atlantic coast.</p>
<p>Huitong News Agency, Madrid, Nineteenth: The Falangist Party organ newspaper "Arriba" criticized Britain's blockade policy yesterday, stating that Spain, as a non-belligerent country, is suffering such pain, which is illegal. The gasoline problem is particularly important to Spain. In 1929, Spain imported 352,000,000 litres of gasoline. Since that year, the gasoline consumption of various countries has increased threefold. It is heard that after Spain's railways were destroyed in the civil war, Spain's transportation is even more dependent on automobiles. But in 1941, Spain only had 263,000,000 litres of gasoline. The situation with kerosene in Spain is also equally serious. However, while there is no need for gasoline in other areas of Europe, gasoline is being transported in. Now, large teams of automobiles, fishing boats, and factories in Spain have stopped operating, the only reason being Britain's ban on gasoline imports.</p>
<h3>Leningrad Front: Fierce Fighting Continues</h3>
<p>London, 19th (Reuters) - According to a broadcast from the Leningrad radio station, fierce fighting is ongoing on the Leningrad front. German forces are desperately attempting to break through Soviet lines, but have failed. The Germans are now deploying automatic rifle units to several sectors in an attempt to alleviate Soviet pressure, but without success. One Soviet unit has even made significant gains. Today's Soviet midday communique stated that there were no major changes on the front on March 18th. Soviet warships sank a 3,500-ton transport ship in the Barents Sea.</p>
<p>Helsinki, Finland, 18th (Havas) - An official war report has been released stating:</p>
<p>- There was infantry and artillery activity on the Karelian Isthmus.</p>
<p>- Our artillery dispersed a Soviet force on the Olonets Isthmus.</p>
<p>- A Soviet attack the previous day was repelled by our forces, with over a hundred enemy deaths and several prisoners taken. Our forces seized a large number of rifles and machine guns.</p>
<p>- Soviet attacks on other northern fronts were also repelled.</p>

<h3>Field Marshal List Inspects German Troops in Finland, Related to Spring Offensive</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 18th (Havas) - After inspecting German troops stationed in northern Norway, Field Marshal List passed through Sweden a few days ago and arrived in Finland to inspect the German troops stationed there before returning to Norway. While List's two inspections appeared unremarkable, those in responsible positions here believe that this move is related to the German army's preparations for a spring offensive in Finland. As for rumors that new German troops have been deployed to Finland, this cannot be confirmed here yet. Currently, various transportation difficulties are due to sea ice and impassable waterways. However, German troops occupying the line from northern Petsamo to Salla may still receive reinforcements, and it is believed that the battlefield there will expand further south. According to well-informed military sources, the German army may attack the Murmansk railway from the north, thereby pressing on Kandalaksha and Sortavala to threaten the junction of the Murmansk-Arkhangelsk railway, which has always been in Red Army hands and has never been directly attacked by Finnish forces. Furthermore, according to news from foreign correspondents in Berlin, there are confirmed to be several armories along the Baltic coast.</p>
<h3>Uruguayan Merchant Ship Sunk, Island Nation Investigating, Preparing Protest to Axis Powers</h3>
<p>Montevideo, Uruguay, 18th (Havas) - Following the sinking of the Uruguayan ship "Montevideo" by a submarine torpedo, the Foreign Ministry is conducting an investigation in order to file a protest. This morning, envoys from several South American countries visited Foreign Minister Guani to express their condolences on behalf of their respective governments. According to a telegram from the captain of the "Montevideo," 18 sailors are missing. It has been determined that 16 of them escaped safely in lifeboats, while the other two drowned. In addition, the German cargo ship "Tacoma," which was docked in this port, has been confiscated by the authorities, and its sailors are currently confined on Flores Island, about 12 miles east of here. They will soon be transferred to Sarandí del Yí Province in the interior for confinement.</p>
<p>Washington, 18th (Havas) - Regarding the sinking of the Uruguayan ship "Montevideo," news has arrived from the Uruguayan capital that the Uruguayan people held another demonstration today to protest. Police authorities have taken necessary measures to protect the shops of Axis nationals and have dispatched personnel to protect the German embassy. People in various places have also held rallies and telegraphed President Baldomir, demanding immediate retaliatory measures.</p>
<p>Washington, 18th (Havas) - Undersecretary of State Welles, representing Secretary of State Hull, met with reporters today and commented on the sinking of the Uruguayan ship "Montevideo" and the decision of several South American countries to suspend shipping to the United States. He said that the Inter-American Defense Board will meet here on the 30th of this month, at which time the issue of escorting merchant ships between North America and South America and between the South American republics will be the main topic of discussion.</p>
<h3>Lyon Supreme Court Continues Trial of National Betrayal Case, General Gamelin and Others Appear to Defend. France's Defeat Attributed to Air Force Inferiority</h3>
<p>Lyon, France, 18th (Havas) - The Lyon Supreme Court convened its 15th session today to try those involved in the national betrayal case. Former Commander of the Alpine Front, General Mittelhauser, spoke, stating that at the beginning of the war, the Alpine fortifications were largely complete and the morale of the defenders was very high. Every enemy offensive was met with a head-on blow, and resistance only ceased when German forces copied our rear and the armistice agreement was signed. We used six divisions to contend with twenty Italian divisions. German forces launched several divisional attacks against us each time, but they were all repelled. However, our forces lacked sufficient officers and both direct-fire and anti-aircraft guns. There was also a lack of communication between the army and the air force, resulting in heavy losses for our forces. As far as tanks are concerned, the German and Italian armies had already gained experience in the application of this weapon during the Spanish Civil War, while we were extremely backward in tank tactics, and even as late as 1937 we were unable to use tank tactics. As for the role of the air force in offensive warfare, we were also completely ignorant. I myself only recognized the power of the air force after the Norwegian campaign. At that time, I warned Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Army, General Gamelin, that dive bombers were a major crisis, as the effectiveness of German bombing technology was astonishing and greatly contributed to undermining morale. In addition, France did not have sufficient intelligence on the military developments in Spain during the Spanish Civil War. On December 15, 1939, I notified the General Staff that the anti-aircraft gun teams under my command were extremely ineffective. If my unit were to be attacked by dive bombers at this time, the whole of France would have to allow the invaders to drive straight in. In terms of the various delaying tactics adopted by France before the defensive war period, they were also ill-conceived. At this point, Daladier asked the witness if he knew that in 1939 the French army had a total of 37,000 officers, which was an increase of 7,400 over the legal quota. General Gamelin suddenly spoke, stating that there were more French officers in 1939 than in the previous Great War in 1914. Not only that, I dare say that at the beginning of the war, France had 4,000 more officers than Germany. Daladier then asked General Mittelhauser to confirm the figures he had put forward, namely, "In July 1938, France had only 34 modern tanks, which increased to 3,500 in 1939, and the number of anti-aircraft guns also increased to 2,500," and emphasized that he had worked hard to rearm during his tenure as Minister of National Defense. General Mittelhauser immediately replied that our rearmament plan, whether in concept or execution, was too late. Next, former Commander-in-Chief of the Ume District, General Franois, the current Commander of the Algiers Region in North Africa, was called as a witness. He stated that the most important factor in frontline warfare was the limited scope of French air force activity, which was insufficient to protect the army from air attacks. The troops transferred from North Africa to the frontline can be called "professional troops." They fought bravely, and not only were the officers excellent, but even the reservists were first-class soldiers. As for the equipment, it was also very good, but there was a lack of hand grenades and motorcycles. Our mechanized units, in terms of materials alone, can be said to be excellent. Our position was also better than in 1914, and morale was high. All the soldiers under my command were able to do their duty, and I loved them all very much. The people of the country were also encouraged by their brave fighting, but because of the lack of air force and heavy artillery, our offensive was only assisted by a small number of tanks, which was very difficult to take effect. Even the bunkers were insufficient. Finally, General Le Gentilhomme, former commander of the Twentieth Army Group, was called as a witness. His words were slightly toned down, attributing France's setbacks entirely to the inadequacy of the French air force. When I asked to strengthen the Vosges Mountains defense line, I encountered great difficulties. In the Saar area, we still had great confidence in the natural barriers as our lines. From the Commander-in-Chief to the ordinary soldiers, they were all able to fulfill their responsibilities. However, because the number of reservists was limited, and their military training only knew theory, their combat capability was very weak. Most of them had only received one year of training, and since 1936, the spirit of the army had deteriorated. Among the officers at all levels, there were also Communist elements, although few in number, they were very active, but it is also a fact that all necessary sanctions were taken at the time. In short, at the outbreak of the war in 1939, the morale of our army was exactly the same as what we had seen three years ago." The court then adjourned at 5:45 p.m. and scheduled to reconvene at 1:30 p.m. tomorrow to call witnesses.</p>
<h3>Airplanes Collide Near Cape Town, Twelve Die</h3>

<h3>Japan Increases Rice Production</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Haitong Agency) - According to the Japanese Minister of Agriculture, the total amount of rice produced in Japan in 1942 will increase by 1,000,000 bushels compared to 1941, reaching a total of 35,800,000 bushels? The production of potatoes and other grains will also increase, it is said.</p>
<h3>Danube Floods, Bulgaria Suffers Heavy Damage</h3>
<p>Sofia, 19th (Haitong Agency) - The Danube River continues to rise, and over a thousand houses have been flooded in the Bulgarian port city of Rousse on the riverbank, leaving over ten thousand people homeless.

<h3>British Prime Minister Churchill Meets Soviet Ambassador</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 19th (Haitong Agency) - According to news from British capital reported by Swedish newspaper, British Prime Minister Churchill met with Soviet Ambassador Maisky last weekend to discuss Anglo-Soviet relations. As for the relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, it is unlikely to be clarified before the US Ambassador Winant returns to his post. According to a correspondent for the Swedish "Dagens Nyheter," both sides were extremely satisfied with Churchill's meeting with the Soviet ambassador, but no decisions were made during the meeting. The content of the talks was largely about political cooperation after the war. This meeting proves that Britain is more willing to cooperate with the Soviet Union than it was several weeks ago.</p>
<h3>Chinese Female Painter Presents Painting to US President</h3>
<p>New York, 18th (Special Dispatch) - According to the New York Times, Ms. Zhang Guangsong, the goddaughter of the famous Chinese artist Guo Guifeng (transliteration), recently painted an American eagle (the national bird of the United States) and presented it to President Roosevelt. When the Japanese army besieged Nanjing, Ms. Zhang worked as a nurse in a rear hospital for two years. Later, she went to the United States to study painting. Her works have been exhibited at the World's Fair in San Francisco. Last year, Ms. Zhang came to New York. The late President Roosevelt's mother greatly admired Ms. Zhang's works and asked her to paint several paintings for her, one of which was the painting of the United States presented to the President. Last week, the United China Relief Association publicly exhibited the painting, which will be delivered to the White House within days.</p>

<h3>The Kachin People of Burma</h3>
<p>In peacetime, if murders, intentional homicides, or accidental deaths occur among the Kachin people, although there is no judicial system to impose sanctions, the village organization is also extremely strict. Usually, the elderly village chief comes out to handle the matter, and according to the severity of the crime, a fine is set, which the murderer admits and pays. If the murderer does not have the means or is unwilling to pay, the matter can only be resolved by force. Both sides gather their comrades and engage in large-scale armed clashes, and they will not stop until the great hatred has been avenged and they are satisfied. Even if the person concerned dies without avenging the wrong, his descendants will continue to retaliate for generations. If their goods, such as grains and livestock, are stolen, or if their wives and daughters are enticed into adultery or give birth to illegitimate children, the same custom of paying fines is adopted to end the crime. Otherwise, they can only rely on force to deal with each other. During armed clashes, they rely entirely on their physical strength to win, and never use skill to subdue. As the saying goes, honest people do not do secret things, and everyone maintains a gentlemanly attitude.</p>
<p>On the day of the armed clash, the angry mobs stirred up the entire village. If a person from Village A is killed in Village B, then all the men, women, old and young in Village B are enemies of Village A, regardless of whether you are related to the matter or not. If you meet on a narrow road, you must be constantly on guard for the danger of death. In the past, when a British expedition passed through Bhamo and the Chinese border, they punished several Kachin people, which they considered a great humiliation, forever imprinted in the hearts of everyone. Twenty years later, when another team of British missionaries passed through this place, they were seriously attacked. When they go out, they must carry a long knife on their shoulder. In the past, they also carried long spears and used strong bows and poisoned arrows, but now they are very particular and have a good gun. They also have flintlock guns, which can play a great role in the depths of the O Mountains.</p>
<p>The Kachin people are very hospitable. Any travelers passing through their mountain country will receive courteous hospitality and enjoy several days of warm treatment. In the surrounding villages, they can get food supplies without spending a penny, and even if you are willing to give them some reward, they will firmly refuse. When you finish your travels, they can also protect you with weapons and escort you out of the country, with heartfelt farewells and a promise to meet again in the future.</p>
<p>Regarding cultivation, the Kachin people still use primitive methods. Every year in early spring, they choose a large piece of land in the dense forest and cut down all the trees, so that the land can be exposed to sunlight. After some time, they set fire to burn the roots of the trees, turning it into a scorched earth. They use hoes to level the ground and then sow seeds. The Kachin people have always regarded slash-and-burn cultivation as beautiful and good. They continue to cultivate in the same place the following year, but by the third year, they believe that the land is no longer fertile and must choose another place to cut down trees.</p>
<p>Like other uncivilized peoples, the Kachin people live in a polytheistic social stage. They believe that trees have tree spirits, mountains have mountain spirits, and even insects, fish, flowers, and plants all have spirits. Spirits have the power to control the thirty-three heavens, the eighteen layers of hell, and the stars, sun, and moon. Spirits can bring blessings and disasters. Whether the crops are abundant and the livestock thrive are all the work of spirits. They believe that spirits are narrow-minded, and if they are not sincerely offered sacrifices, they will never bestow blessings. Conversely, if they are offered sacrifices of cattle and sheep at all times, they will surely pray for blessings and gain blessings, and seek longevity and gain longevity. The people who communicate with spirits are shamans, who have a special status in society and are respected by the masses.</p>
<p>Although the Kachin people live a primitive life and are superstitious about divine power, they are all very strong, not afraid of hardship, able to adapt to the environment, and able to fight against nature. Relying on these points, they have lived in the deep mountains for generations. Regarding their population, it is of course impossible to estimate because they are scattered everywhere, but according to the vast area they currently inhabit, the strength of this nation is quite great. It is said that forty years ago, Dr. O.H. Hanson, a Baptist missionary from the United States, used Roman letters to spell out the Kachin language and created a Kachin script. In this vast mountainous area, some young people are gradually using this new script.</p>
<p>The most powerful and influential ethnic group bordering the Kachin people is the Lisu people. These two major ethnic groups belong to the same Mongoloid race in bloodline, and migrated slowly southward from their old home in Tibet. There are also Lisu tribes in the Nujiang Mountains of Yunnan. This is like the Shan people of Myanmar, distributed in China, Myanmar, and Thailand. These several powerful ethnic groups live primitive lives, stretching for thousands of years and always possessing a fighting character, which must not be underestimated.</p>

<h3>Rice Supply Already Arranged, Residents Need Not Worry, Needed Rice Amount Guaranteed by Japanese Authorities</h3>
<p>A public announcement by the Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office states: The Council has always paid special attention to the food needs of the two settlements, especially rice, in the past three months, and has maintained close contact with the Japanese and French Concession authorities. At the same time, the authorities have had the closest cooperation in obtaining the required food supplies, and have carefully planned to ensure that all citizens can obtain their allocated amount of food.</p>
<p>Inventory as Usual, Sources Assured</p>
<p>Residents need not worry about the future rice supply. Until recently, domestic rice has been continuously entering the settlement, but although the entry of domestic rice has stopped, the Japanese authorities have guaranteed to the Council that they will allow the Council to handle the rice supply. This rice is equivalent to the amount of domestic rice that has been trickling into Shanghai in the past, so the city's rice inventory has not been affected. In addition, the Japanese authorities will allocate rice to the Council for the needs of large food consumers and for sale to the public through rice shops. In the future, the Council will continue to supply this rice to all food consumers.</p>
<p>French Concession Also Supplied</p>
<p>In the past three months, the French authorities have been in constant contact with the Japanese and Public Concession authorities regarding the food supply for residents, and have paid attention to it, especially the rice issue. This close cooperation has never been interrupted, in order to ensure that residents do not have to worry about the lack of essential food. In short, the public does not need to worry about the future rice supply. Although the domestic rice that used to arrive in Shanghai has now stopped, the rice inventory can still be maintained, and the Japanese authorities have guaranteed to the French Council that they are willing to supply the Council with the same amount of domestic rice as before. As for the rice needed by large food consumers and retail rice shops, the French authorities can obtain it from the Japanese authorities for distribution.</p>
<p>Rice Shops Today All Sell Corn</p>
<p>The Rice and Grain Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council designated the foreign rice extracted from the Yuan Tonghua Sheng Zhejiang and other three warehouses the other day, and rice shops can sell it out today to meet the needs of tomorrow (Saturday). Today (Friday), all 395 rice shops in the two concessions are selling corn. The rice shops have extracted all of this corn yesterday. The Flour Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council hopes to have whole bags of corn flour for sale soon to meet the needs. The quality is roughly number three or four. The application method is roughly the same as for flour. The weight, price, and transportation cost of the whole bag of corn flour will be negotiated and announced soon.</p>
<p>Bread Purchase Divided Between New and Old Customers</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that in order to establish an effective bread distribution method for residents within the French Concession, so as to eliminate the crowding in front of bakeries, the French Concession authorities announced the implementation of a new system yesterday (the 18th), stipulating that each bakery should distribute bread to registered old customers in the morning, and then sell it to residents who did not get bread in the morning in the afternoon. Until now, old customers of bakeries still had to line up in the same line with occasional purchasers. But under the current system, they will register with the French authorities so that they can get allocated bread in the morning. The implementation of this new distribution system can prevent crowding in front of bakeries and help the authorities estimate the total amount of flour needed by bakeries to supply old customers.</p>
<p>Rice and Bread Cannot Be Obtained at the Same Time</p>
<p>The authorities are now also formulating plans to prevent bread and rice from being allocated to the same household at the same time. If these plans are realized, then most of the Chinese who usually eat rice will not be able to buy bread from bakeries. When bakeries register the number of customers with the authorities, they must report the customer's name, address, the amount of bread consumed daily, and the number of people in their household, so that registered customers can buy bread without worrying about a shortage. As for unregistered customers who occasionally come to buy bread, they can buy bread in the afternoon. However, the distribution system for unregistered customers has been studied, because the authorities know that there are often those who buy more bread from several stores than they need. A person from a large bakery in the French Concession told reporters yesterday that the list of old customers in the store has now been completed, so registration can be done soon. The Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council is paying close attention to these developments and has studied the implementation of the same method.</p>
<p>Council Will Issue a Notice Soon</p>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council announced this morning (the 19th) its intention to formulate regulations for the supply of bread to residents within the Concession. Queuing to buy bread is a common sight in the Public Concession, so the Council has decided to control the sale of bread by bakeries. Although no definite decision has been made, it is expected that the Council will issue a notice soon.</p>
<h3>Soviet Ship to Sail to Vladivostok, General Valery to Continue Sailing between Shanghai and Vietnam</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the Soviet ship Bichevaya Industriya, leased by the Expoithleb Association, has been repaired in Shanghai and is scheduled to set sail for Vladivostok in a few days. This ship and four other Soviet ships, namely the Gorky, Timiryazev, Volkov, and Komintern, came here from Vladivostok last year for major repairs. Three of them left Shanghai before the outbreak of the war, and the Timiryazev sailed out a month ago, leaving only the Bichevaya Industriya. Originally a ship used for fish canning, it has now been converted into a cargo and passenger ship, carrying a batch of war goods and some passengers to Vladivostok. According to shipping sources, the General Valery, which was previously leased by the Japanese authorities and has now expired, is scheduled to leave Shanghai at the end of the week and sail south, continuing to sail on the Shanghai-Saigon and Haiphong lines.</p>
<h3>New Ship on Shanghai-Ningbo Line, Hua Wan to Sail to Ningbo</h3>
<p>In addition to the five ships currently sailing on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, namely the Hua, Wanji, Naruto, Haitong, and Changshan, the Hua Wan will join on the 21st of this month, i.e., on the maiden voyage to Ningbo on that day. Since the authorities of the two concessions have actively evacuated the population, there have been many passengers on each sailing to Ningbo. However, the number of people coming to Shanghai from Ningbo is small due to the restrictions on exports, and they all have local export permits and are limited to returning to Ningbo within a specified time.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Puller Finds a Large Sum of Money, Unexpected Wealth Ultimately Not His, Affair Causes Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Wang Shuqing, the general affairs director of Lianchang Bank at No. 301 Tianjin Road, hired a rickshaw at 2:30 PM on the 26th of last month, carrying reserve banknotes of 8,500 yuan to the Jinmen Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road. Upon alighting, he suddenly forgot the banknotes on the rickshaw, and the rickshaw number was not noted. He placed an advertisement offering a reward of 1,000 yuan to find it. The rickshaw puller who carried Wang was named Liu Qingshan, rickshaw number 3100. Liu was overjoyed upon finding the money and hurriedly pulled the rickshaw back to his home at No. 305 Chi Hong Road. After counting the amount, he hid it in a box and went out to bathe. Unexpectedly, while he was counting the money, a fellow rickshaw puller, Wei Yulin, saw it. Taking advantage of Liu's absence, Wei sneaked in, broke the lock, and stole 6,000 yuan. When Liu returned home and discovered the theft, he investigated and learned that Wei had stolen it. Because Wei was extremely poor and now had a box full of banknotes, Liu argued with him, leading to a conflict. The incident was detected by Peng Bingsheng, a Chinese detective from the Criminal Section of the Public Concession Police Department, who first arrested Liu and confiscated the remaining 2,000 yuan. He then arrested Wei at No. 29, Lane 209, Wuding Road, confiscating 900 yuan of stolen money. Xu Qingquan, a relative of Wei, was also arrested at his home, and 2,600 yuan of Wei's deposited money was confiscated. Another 1,500 yuan had been sent by Wei to his hometown, and Liu had already spent 500 yuan. All involved were taken into custody, pending further investigation to determine the remaining amount.</p>
<h3>Doctor Yu Xin'en Speaks on Child Nutrition</h3>
<p>A child welfare seminar was held on the fourth floor of the Public Works Department's Tiantingfang building.

<h3>Subletting License Implementation Date Undecided, April 1 Deadline Unreliable, License Date Pending Official Announcement</h3>
<p>The English-language "North China Daily News" reported on the 17th of this month that the Public Works Department had set a deadline of April 1 for landlords subletting properties within the Public Concession to register and obtain licenses. This caused panic and doubt among sub-landlords, who rushed to the police authorities to apply for registration but were unable to obtain clear instructions. According to the regulations on subletting licenses, the Public Works Department issued a public notice on February 25, stating only that disputes between sub-landlords and sub-tenants should not be referred to the Public Works Department until the implementation date of the license system was announced.</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, the date for the implementation of the subletting license application and registration system has not yet been decided. Therefore, the rumor that the registration deadline is April 1 is untrue. The implementation date for the issuance of this subletting license will be announced by the Public Works Department.</p>
<h3>Conclusion of Dispersal of Refugees, More than 4,000 People to be Dispersed Today</h3>
<p>The dispersal of refugees from Shanghai's refugee shelters will come to an end today, as the grace period expires today. According to reports from the Datong News Agency, refugees will be dispersed today from four locations: Dunxin Road, North Zhejiang Road, Jisi Feier Road, and Tianhou Palace. Half have already been dispersed in succession. Of the remaining 4,000, the 200 orphans will be excluded and continue to receive relief from organizations such as the Jisheng Society. All others must be dispersed from the shelters. Today is the final day for those who have not received their dispersal allowance to collect it. The relevant police departments will also dispatch officers to assist. The refugee problem, which has persisted for four years, will thus come to a conclusion.</p>
<h3>Rising Prices in Shanghai Affecting the Lives of Monks and Laypeople</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>There are hundreds of Buddhist temples and nunneries in this city, with thousands of monks and laypeople, forming an independent unit within the entire society. The living conditions of these people are often overlooked by the general public, especially by those who claim to have "no connection with monks and Taoists." In normal times, they "do not enter the Three Treasures Hall," and in times of crisis, they "do not embrace the Buddha's feet." Therefore, the mysteries of life in this special circle, to outsiders, seem unchanging, as mysterious as Zen principles, and difficult to understand.</p>
<p>Vocational</p>
<p>The sole livelihood of monks in ordinary temples is to chant scriptures, perform meritorious deeds, eliminate disasters, and pray for blessings. Each "vocational" temple has a monastic community—referred to as "masters"—ranging from a dozen to hundreds. When there are Buddhist ceremonies, cymbals, drums, and bells ring in unison, incense smoke swirls, and chanting continues all day. After the rituals are completed, the "accounting office" issues an invoice, with various items clearly itemized: number of masters, candles, vegetarian feast, tea and water, incense, and transportation costs, all to be paid. In addition to the regular bill, there are also "rewards," with guests and hosts rejoicing and everyone happy.</p>
<p>Large Expenses</p>
<p>With the high cost of everything in Shanghai, all living beings are affected, and the monks in the temples are no exception. A few large temples own land and do not rely solely on chanting scriptures for income. The remaining small temples rely entirely on donations from Buddhists, offerings from benefactors, and "gold contributions" from donors, which are few in number. The expenses of the temple are like those of ordinary shops or residences: rent, police donations, gas, water, and the seven necessities of life, all requiring cash. There are no other methods available simply because they belong to the Buddhist community.</p>
<p>Slow Seasons in Winter and Summer</p>
<p>Buddhist ceremonies in temples vary with the seasons. Spring and autumn are the peak months, with bright candlelights and loud chanting every day, and the main hall flourishing. In the hot summer months and the busy winter months, benefactors avoid mundane affairs and have no time to visit the temple to worship Buddha, so the temple's income naturally declines. In addition to "family members" using temples to liberate the souls of the deceased and commemorate ancestors, birthdays and other events are also based here. As for Buddhist birthdays, consecrations, scripture lectures, ordination ceremonies, the passing of old monks, and the succession of abbots, all large forests or a small temple in the corner, according to the resources, seriously, can not be ignored.</p>
<p>Expensive Clothing</p>
<p>Fine silks, wools, and serges are not what monks need, but wide-sleeved gray-black robes, long cloth socks, monk's shoes, and monk's hats are indispensable. At the current market price, old cloth sells for more than two yuan per foot. A monk's robe, including labor and materials, reportedly costs no less than forty or fifty yuan. A pair of long cloth socks costs about six or seven yuan, and good black cloth shoes with cloth soles cost more than thirty yuan. Undershirts and trousers are not included. All clothing needs must be provided by the monks themselves. Recently, the average income of ordinary masters in small temples is only about thirty to forty yuan. Although they have two thin and one dry bland meals of porridge and rice every day, the hardship of their lives can be imagined.</p>
<p>Becoming a Buddha Is Not Easy</p>
<p>The "becoming a Buddha" here does not refer to monks becoming Buddhas, but to the origin of the Buddha statues in the temple. The large and small Buddha statues in the temple are all made by the "Buddha-making place"—located in Xin Beidoucheng—and are carved from whole pieces of cedar wood. Currently, wood prices are soaring, supplies are cut off, gold prices are skyrocketing, and labor costs have doubled. Not to mention a large Buddha, even a small Bodhisattva costs hundreds of gold coins. If we want to build a giant Buddha statue like the one in Yangon, it will require the strength of the entire city! Buddha said that all sentient beings in the world are suffering. How wonderful!</p>

<h3>Demanding One Yuan in Debt, European Kills Man, Defendant Denies Murder</h3>
<p>Li A'jin, a Tongzhou native residing at No. 5, Lane 459, Avenue Haig, is 44 years old and works as a rickshaw puller. On December 15th of last year, Li borrowed two yuan from Qiu Haitao, a Tongzhou native and foreman at the Zhu Shunji rickshaw company at No. 6, Lane 353, Rue Maber. By January 15th of this year, he had repaid one yuan. On the 7th of this month, after Li finished pulling his rickshaw and returned to the Zhu Shunji company, Qiu demanded the remaining one yuan from Li, but without success, a conflict ensued. After being beaten, Li returned home, vomiting blood and unable to continue pulling his rickshaw. He remained in bed for ten days. Unexpectedly, at 10:00 AM on the 17th, Li A'jin suddenly died. His wife, Li Wangshi, believed that her husband was beaten to death by Qiu Haitao and reported the incident to the New Concession Police Department. Detectives were dispatched to arrest Qiu and bring him to the police station. Under questioning, Qiu admitted to having a verbal argument with the deceased but denied physically assaulting him. He was ordered to be detained pending an examination of the body.</p>

<h3>Walk Carefully, Otherwise, You Will Be Punished According to the Rules</h3>
<p>The French Municipal Council warned pedestrians yesterday, saying that recently, due to the scarcity of cars in the city, pedestrians are often careless when walking in the road or crossing the street. This causes many difficulties for bicycles, rickshaws, handcarts, and other vehicles, and many people gather at intersections or stand in the middle of the road and talk. They are unable to comply with the rules they used to follow before the disappearance of cars. This matter has attracted the attention of the French Municipal Council, which has instructed detectives to closely monitor pedestrians and warn the public that any pedestrian who disregards traffic regulations and obstructs traffic will be fined or otherwise punished, depending on the severity of the violation.</p>
<h3>Coal Shop Owner Killed, Stabbed Six or Seven Times</h3>

<h3>Please Investigate and Suppress, Goods Intercepted Along the Road</h3>
<p>Recently, a large number of bandit-like figures, dressed like beggars, have been forming gangs along Yuchaqing Road and Avenue Edward VII, intercepting passing merchants and cargo vehicles carrying cigarettes and other goods. As a result, customers regard the area as dangerous, which has greatly affected the business of shops in the area, causing significant losses. It is learned that dozens of cigarette and department stores along Avenue Edward VII and Yuchaqing Road jointly requested the police authorities yesterday to add police posts in the area and conduct strict investigations to eliminate these bandits, in order to benefit merchants and maintain public order.</p>

<p>"Yes, after all, transportation will be troublesome, you go to tell Afu in the kitchen, tomorrow buy vegetables, be sure to buy a cow lung, feed it to Ahuang."</p>
<p>"You used to scold people as pigs, now you eat exactly what pigs used to eat, this is called the present retribution of scolding people."</p>
<p>"Ha! Don't be sarcastic, I am speculating and hoarding now, made a fortune, pearls are measured in buckets, wheat bran and gold crumbs, cooked to eat, you think, isn't it great!"</p>
<p>"Hey! Be careful! Don't meet the patrolling sea yaksha, Rakshasa little ghost, Kunlun momo in the dark, will steal what you are carrying on your shoulders."</p>
<p>"Cough, it doesn't matter, money can communicate with God, I have a clever plan at the moment."</p>
<p>"Under the dim light, two old men are walking and coming, mumbling in their mouths, I don't know what to say, but I hear:</p>
<p>"Truly, what does heaven say, what does heaven say! This is called where can people hide, where can people hide!"</p>
<p>"Curfew has arrived, in a short time, we will have to see the light again, then is it that everything is as it should be? A happy time for joy!"</p>

<h3>This Year's Western Youth Volleyball Tournament - Registration Starts Tomorrow - Still Divided into Three Groups: Men's A, Men's B, and Women's</h3>
<p>The 14th Western Youth Volleyball Invitational League invitation letters have been issued. This year, it is still divided into three groups: Men's A, Men's B, and the Women's group. Registration will begin tomorrow (Saturday). It is reported that the Soviet team has officially joined Group A. In addition, the Russian Overseas Chinese Association will also participate in the competition. This team unfortunately lost to Western Youth in the final decisive match last year, finishing as runner-up. Therefore, their strength is very strong. This year, Western Youth has given up joining Group A. Besides the original famous players of the Russian Overseas Chinese team, such as Leishev, Gaozug, Gaoman, the team has also obtained the assistance of Western Youth's Luo Qingu, Maitolis, Fulo, and Gu. Their fighting power has been further strengthened. It is yet to be determined whether the Chinese team, Yinghua, will join. According to Western Youth's Kaiji Milov, if there are too few participants in Group A, only Group B will be held, with each team limited to two Group A players to increase interest. As for the Women's group, the Youxing team, which has won four consecutive championships, will participate again this year. Western Youth will join Group B with three teams. In terms of strength, the Russian捕 (Russian capture) team is the strongest. The Chinese powerhouse, the White team, possesses famous players such as Zhang Deyuan and Shi Yin, which will definitely be a major concern for the Russian捕 team. The competition is expected to kick off in the Western Youth gymnasium at the beginning of next month.</p>

<h3>Gold Eagerly Seeking Liquidation - Regardless of Low Prices</h3>
<p>The cash market in Shanghai is tight, and prices continue to fall. The price has retreated into the 17,000 yuan range. This is mainly because Jin Yuan Securities and Tong Kangyong are inclined to sell, due to unfavorable rumors about gold. Retail investors are scrambling to sell even more fiercely. Although Japanese military notes are still stable, there is no shortage of buyers to raise the price, but the price is still gradually falling. The mood of all parties is uncertain. The opening price in the morning was 18,200 yuan, which was 80 yuan lower than the closing price of the previous day. The price then went to 18,100 yuan. Securities companies such as Chengji and Decheng came to increase bids, raising the price to 18,350 yuan. Suddenly, a certain gold company commissioned Jin Yuan and Tong Kangyong, along with Yimao and Yongxiejie, to rush to sell. Negative rumors also arose, and many retailers rushed to get rid of their holdings. The downward trend became even sharper, plunging by 550 yuan, falling to 17,800 yuan. When news came that the Japanese military notes had risen to the 7 yuan mark, the market rebounded. Hefaji, Chengji, Defu, and retail investors all scrambled to buy, and the price was temporarily raised by 650 yuan to reach 18,450 yuan. After 11 o'clock, the downward trend resumed. Rumors of profit-taking sales became even more prevalent. Jin Yuan, Tong Kangyong, Shengda, Yonghefa, Yimao, Yong, and other securities companies competed to sell. Many floating orders were urgently cut, regardless of the low price, resulting in a sharp drop of 950 yuan, breaking the 18,000 yuan mark again. At 11:33, the price fell to a low of 17,500 yuan. Retail investors absorbed some of the holdings, and the price slightly rebounded. The closing price at noon was 17,650 yuan, which was 630 yuan lower than the closing price of the previous day. The difference for the day was 950 yuan. After closing, the price rose back to 17,800 yuan. Transaction volume was not strong. The jewelry gold price was quoted by Daxin and its counterparts at 50 yuan less per tael, at 1,850 yuan (purchase price reduced by 200 yuan). Silver was quoted at 20 yuan. The black market price of Laotianbao was 15 yuan, but there were no buyers. The price of a silver coin also retreated to the 10 yuan mark.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange market conditions: The prices of British and American gold pounds each fell by 10 yuan, with the former at 400 yuan and the latter at 410 yuan. American dollar notes also retreated to 20.50 yuan. Hong Kong dollar notes were still at 3.30 yuan, with large notes reduced by 10 cents. Military notes had been as high as 7 yuan, but the final price was 6.85 yuan, down 5 cents from the previous day's closing.</p>
<h3>January's Note Circulation - Presents Unprecedented Contraction</h3>
<p>Since December 8th of last year, all industries in this city have largely been in a state of stagnation. The business of various banks has also become sluggish, and note exchange has also decreased. According to the report of the Shanghai Note Exchange, the total amount of exchange in January of this year was 42,360,09,709.50 yuan in national currency. The total amount in January of last year was 110,282,51,48.05 yuan in national currency. Compared to the two, there was a decrease of 67,921,5438.55 yuan.</p>
<h3>New Correspondent Banks of the Silver Reserve Committee</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the increase in the number of new banks in this city, the correspondent banks of the Banking Industry Joint Reserve Committee have also increased accordingly. The new correspondent bank accounts and names of the committee are listed below: Guofu Bank, Shengda Trust Company, Yongfeng Bank, Dayou Silver Industry Company, Central Trust Company, Guoxin Bank, Limin Bank, Huiyuan Bank, Zhenye Bank, China Tobacco Industry Bank, Anhua Bank, Great Wall Bank, Jiangsu Local Bank.</p>
<h3>Public Bond Resale More Active</h3>
<p>The public bond grey market suddenly trended downward yesterday, because there were more sellers and very few takers. The downward trend became even more severe. Ruidu sold Category C bonds in particular. Yichang, Yitai, Dazhong, Gongmao, Zhongfu, Hongda, and others also sold as opportunities arose. However, the capacity of buyers like Tongli, Yuxing, Xinhua, and Tongxing was limited, and they seemed indifferent. The market price became increasingly weak. Categories A, D, and C all broke through the two major marks of 70 yuan and 60 yuan. Although Xinhua did not receive Category A bonds, Renchang specially supplied them. The situation did not stabilize, because Ruidu's sales had not yet been satisfied. On the other hand, transactions in other markets were active, and everyone abandoned this market for those. For a while, it may not be easy to stabilize the future. As a result, the price fell by as much as 1.05 yuan to 2 yuan. The transaction volume was only over 300,000 yuan. A concise table is listed below:</p>

<h3>Bananas (5)</h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>More than 50 years ago, there was a famous "United Fruit Company" in the United States - the "Banana King" - using its abundant financial power and strong political skills, systematically and step by step cultivated bananas in Central America and the West Indies. These areas, which have always been barren and rife with yellow fever and heatstroke, have now become very prosperous places! Costa Rica, such a small country, alone has 23,000 hectares of banana fields, producing approximately 12 million bunches of bananas annually! As for the British island of Jamaica, it can also produce 15 million bunches annually. As a result, various South American countries have also followed suit. The production volume of Xiangshan and the Philippines is also increasing day by day. I wonder if the banana growers in our country's Fujian and Guangdong provinces will also work hard to catch up!</p>
<p>The chemical composition of bananas is: water accounts for 76%, carbohydrates - sugar and starch - account for 22%, protein accounts for 1.3%, fat accounts for 0.6%, and vitamins and minerals account for 0.8%. The country that consumes the most bananas in the world is the United States, which eats more than 45 million bunches every year. The second is the United Kingdom, which eats 12 million bunches every year. Other countries are far behind. ...</p>
<h3>Economic Chats</h3>
<p>— Feng Liu</p>
<p>I have discussed diamonds twice, and I secretly suspect that the name of the diamond is related to the vajra mentioned in Buddhist scriptures. Therefore, I want to seek its trace to cite it as evidence. When I read the Book of Song of the Six Dynasties, the Kingdom of Kapilavastu of India in Yuanjia five years献 (presented) a diamond ring, a marquis gold ring, and other physical objects. At that time, it was 1484 years before the Republic of China era (428 years in the West). In the seventh year, the kingdom of Karadana again獻 (presented) a diamond ring. The ring is the ring of today, I have said before, transmitted from the southwest countries, probably among the kings of the southwest countries at that time quite a few used rings as seals, so it is similar to the present-day signet ring. When I read the Book of Sui, the Kingdom of Persia produced Fire Jade Diamond. Fire Jade is shaped like mica, the color is like purple gold, with radiance, separated it is like cicada wings, accumulated it is like the heavy folds of gauze. But the shape of the diamond is not detailed in the book. The Book of Tang, the Kingdom of India had a record of the shape of the diamond, saying it is similar to amethyst, tempered hundreds of times without dissolving, can cut jade. The New Book of Tang, the Biography of the Kingdom of Funan, also said that it produced diamonds, like amethyst, growing on stones at the bottom of the water, people dive into the water to take it, can carve jade, knock it with　 (a missing character) horn, then　 (a missing character). That is, the so-called antelope horn can break the diamond. It also said that the kingdom of Fulin has a night-shining wall and a bright moon pearl, I don't know if they are diamond-like treasures.</p>
<p>As described in the historical books, the diamond is undoubtedly a diamond. When I ask for it in Buddhist books, the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma also lists diamonds among the various treasures. It is also transformed into 84,000 lotus flowers of various treasures, saying that Jambudani gold is used as　(a missing character), silver as leaves, and diamond as stamens. The stamen is the pistil of the flower, and diamond is used as the stamen, taking its similar granules. Then Shakyamuni Buddha knew of the existence of the diamond, and knew that it was a precious item, so he used it to metaphorize that the meaning of the scriptures cannot be broken, as the treasure among treasures. Recently, I also read the lectures on the Diamond Sutra by layman Jiang Weinong (which was given to me by layman Jiang Zhuzhuang)　 (To be continued)</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Film Companies in Various Countries - Start Handling Closure</h3>
<p>— Taixu</p>
<p>Film Stock Exhausted!</p>
<p>After December 8th of last year, various businesses were seriously affected. The biggest problem in the film industry is, of course, film stock. At that time, it was impossible to accurately count how much film stock was left in Shanghai. Because each company had some inventory of its own, and small hoarders also had some "savings," and it was generally expected that Japanese film could also be shipped to Shanghai. Therefore, the filming work of various companies has never stopped, and they have tried to save as much film as possible for each new film.　 For example, the length of each film was previously around 10,000 feet, but it was changed to around 9,000 feet. NG was reduced as much as possible, and some company authorities limited directors to using only 12,000 feet of film for each film. In order to extend the life of domestic films, the waste of exceeding tens of thousands of feet of film for each film as before should no longer be discovered.</p>
<p>Although the domestic film industry is operating so miserably, the fact that film is being used up foot by foot is ironclad. Starting from the previous month, the monthly film production of each film company in Shanghai was limited to six. The distribution ratio is: Yihua one film, Guohua one film, Guolian (i.e., Xinhua 　Xin　Cheng) three films. In fact, at that time, the film stock was decreasing like rice. According to the news obtained yesterday, if there is no new turning point, the domestic Lei shadow will inevitably be completely stopped in the future.</p>
<p>In addition to the unfinished works being rushed to completion, the set of Yue　's "Mysterious Girl郎" had already been built, and was also dismantled yesterday. Yihua Company also only has three unfinished works - "Tears on the Land of Longing," "Mandarin Duck Tears," and "School Scenery" - continuing to work, and the parts of "Grand Hotel" that have already been filmed have been decided to be sacrificed. Jin Xing has one "Out of the Cage" and "Turbulent Times Scenery." Guohua's "Lin Daiyu" has not been started because Zhou　 hurt her leg while riding a bicycle. It is expected that these last few films of each company can maintain the use of the first-run cinemas in Shanghai for two or three months.</p>
<p>After the companies close, the panic of nearly a thousand people in Shanghai from　　 can be imagined. The only way out is 濱 (near) drama. Fortunately, the atmosphere of drama is still quite strong recently, and there are already several groups in the process of organizing individually, but finding a venue is also quite difficult. Therefore, some groups may develop to other ports. - The details of this new development can be detailed 　告 (reported) in two months.</p>
<p>The drama groups currently performing include:　 Fei's Meiyi Troupe, Carlton's Art Society, Hongbao's Weiming Drama Society, and the Eighth Art Troupe, which will soon perform "Martyrdom" at the Lyceum. The Eighth Art Troupe was originally of a short-term nature, but due to this change, it may be decided to perform for a long time. The contract between Meiyi and　 Fei was originally until the end of this month, but recently there has been cooperation with Yao Ke, with the intention of entering the Lyceum. I don't know what changes there are now, and it is difficult to predict for a while.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned venues where dramas can be performed, new venues seem to be not easy to obtain. However, according to people in the film industry, the Grand Shanghai and Huguang theaters are two ideal drama theaters in terms of equipment and transportation. This estimate is inevitably premature, but it is originally easiest to convert a cinema into a drama theater. After March, the situation in Shanghai will inevitably not be 　測 (measured) as it is now.</p>
<h3>Sailing in the Same Storm</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(2) Sorrow and Joy</p>
<p>"The multitude denies but confirms," everyone comforted Weicheng, saying that Mrs. Ye Da was much better after Lin Shaobang gave her an injection. She had been a little short of breath just now, but now the shortness of breath has subsided a little. 　Zhen, with red eyes, carried a 　 cane chair over and let Weicheng sit half-sitting, looking at Mrs. Ye Da. Weicheng seemed to have returned from a trip, waking up from a dream, asking if she had taken her medicine, if she had taken her medicine. Mrs. Ye Er said, "With　 Zhen here, one person is worth three or four people to serve, so rest assured."</p>
<p>Mrs. Li You　 came too, and the eldest aunt　 brought her youngest child. People from the front and back houses all came to visit, all saying how good Mrs. Ye Da was to others. When it was time for dinner, Weicheng still said he wasn't hungry. The family members seemed to not allow Weicheng to not be hungry, and forced him to eat, but he only drank a　 thin bowl of porridge. Several lamps were lit in the room, brightly lit. In theory, those who didn't　 rest last night should be able to rest tonight, but Mrs. Ye Er, from the voice of a person who doesn't agree with each other, knew that tonight was the most critical moment, saying: "Eldest sister-in-law will get better after tonight." Invisibly, she　托 (entrusted) that everyone should take care tonight and not neglect it. Weicheng always had a stone pressing on his heart　, he　 ran turned around and asked: "Where's Juzhen?" Mrs. Ye Er said: "　Zhen, she's gone. She's also a poor child. Her uncle, Fei Changhe, how can he compare to厲 (Li) family's uncle. If she doesn't go back to her uncle's house, all kinds of rumors will be made up. She's gone."</p>
<h3>Another Person Jumping Off a Building</h3>
<p>— Han Fufang</p>
<p>Recently, there have been so many "stories" of people jumping off buildings, 猛　(violently striking) telephone poles, taking poison... I really can't count them all. The reason for this is nothing more than being forced by life. This is the case for jumping off buildings, and it is also the case for violently striking telephone poles and taking poison.</p>
<p>"Everyone has a heart of compassion." Therefore, there are indeed quite a few who sigh and weep. However, those who lack a feeling of "I am like him" account for the majority. Alas, lamentable!</p>
<p>A friend came to visit and, after talking about oil and rice, also mentioned the matter of suicide. A friend vividly told the story of a jump: "A young man in a short cloth shirt jumped down from a tall building and died when he hit the ground. Probably because he fell very painfully, the legs of the deceased clenched and raised very high." After the friend finished speaking, he solemnly added an explanation of the identity of the suicide: "It is said that the deceased's long robe and 직공呢 (direct tribute wool) shoes were all taken off upstairs." I have heard many stories of suicide, and I feel indifferent, but the last explanation cannot help but make you "feel something."</p>
<p>Suicide is not the best policy, and it is even more cowardly and confused to be afraid of making a　(missing character) by suicide and hide clothes and hats to prevent people from identifying the truth.</p>
<p>"Die to save face and suffer alive." This is a very good proverb. However, there are not many who can be warned by this. Is this jumper also not the case? It seems that suicide is only limited to the short blue cloth shirt class. If you commit suicide in a long robe, it is really detrimental to decency.</p>
<p>It is said that suicide requires courage, otherwise you cannot "die." However, this courage is limited to the moment of "death." As for the courage to commit suicide in a robe, there is an exception, and it is even more out of the question when hoping to transplant the courage to "die" to the courage to "live."</p>
<p>Suicide is never the best policy, I hope that people who want to commit suicide will take good care of themselves!</p>
<p>Amusement Miscellany</p>
<h3>Double Reed</h3>
<p>— Zefu</p>
<p>It is said that the double reed originated with Huang Fuchen. Huang was 　 a well-known person, with an extraordinarily ugly face and a lame foot. At first, he was also a storyteller, able to imitate the movements of various characters alone, so he was named Double Huang. Later, it began to be divided into two people, imitating one person. (See Li Feishu's "Memories by the Plum Tree"). Or it is said that Huang was an amateur actor in Beijing, who performed this play with his brother, hence the name Change Huang. (See Qing Wu's "Flower Teahouse between Beijing and Tianjin"). According to the two existing manuscript copies of Zhang's Double Reed, one of them says: "We are learning from the deceased businessman Huang Fuchen, and people call him Huang Laotai." Then Huang Fuchen seems to be Huang Fuchen. This kind of storytelling is of the same nature as crosstalk, specializing in making people laugh and enjoy themselves. However, crosstalk is a dialogue between two people, while double reed is one sitting in front and one hidden behind. The one sitting is the clown, and the one hidden is the straight character. The straight character talks, laughs, sings behind, and the clown performs in front with the sound, gesticulating, as if he is the one speaking and singing. However, in the middle of the performance, the straight character often deliberately pretends to be 打　(missing character), so that the clown cannot perform, so as to change other　(missing character) programs. Therefore, in one 塲(performance), sometimes speaking and laughing, sometimes singing, there is no plot at all, and no story is worth telling. When performing, there is nothing other than the awakening wood; only when singing, the straight character occasionally adds 彈 (plucking) strings to help the rhythm.</p>
<h3>Sales Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Guo Rui</p>
<p>When a waiter in a coffee shop asks if you want an egg in your milk powder, you almost instinctively say "no." However, a clerk trained by Elmer Wheeler, the creator of "Tested Selling Sentences," would pick up an egg in each hand and ask if you want one or two. At that point, almost without thinking, you would say "one," and the cash register would record an extra sum of money. Wheeler provided hundreds of these advantageous dialogues to owners of gas stations, restaurants, department stores, and necklace shops, making him famous in the history of applied psychology.</p>
<p>"Don't ask people if they want it," Wheeler said, "ask them which one they want." Never give customers a chance to decide whether to buy; don't ask questions they can easily answer "no" to. At a soda fountain in Brooklyn, the waiters always ask people who want Coca-Cola if they want a large or small bottle; few people want a large one. After Wheeler's tests, the waiters only asked, "Large bottle?" Indeed, two out of every five times, it was a large bottle.</p>
<p>Thus, more than a decade ago, Wheeler's new profession was born – to draft the most effective sentences for selling goods. When Wheeler and his staff work, they don't immediately come up with ready-made slogans. They spend a long time listening, recording, and modifying.</p>
<p>Wheeler's activities are not limited to the vicinity. He advised cleaning workers to bring soap and towels into the house, and before touching any furniture, first ask where they can wash their hands. According to his suggestion, laundry businesses instructed all female shop assistants, whether married or not, to call themselves "Mrs." So-and-so. He also advised vacuum cleaner salesmen to first find birds, dogs, and children as soon as they enter a house. If they find a canary, the salesman's "standard phrase" is "Does it sing?" If there is a dog, he should ask its name; if there are children, he should ask their names and ages. One salesman used this method to get 92 percent of the people who had "Solicitors and beggars not allowed" signs on their doors to buy his vacuum cleaner. Once, Wheeler happened to tell a dog owner that a sign saying "Beware of dog" was not as effective as "Beware of hungry dog." (Abridged translation from "Reader's Digest")</p>
