<p>印度問題專題</p>
<h3>九·印度之寺院與建築（下）</h3>
<p>松溪（Sanchi）塔爲印度最古之名塔，其建築年代已難確定，或云前二世紀後半期之作，相傳阿育王統領八萬四千國，敕諸國建寺共八萬四千所，建塔亦八萬四千座，此松溪塔即爲其中之一云。大塔之外，尙有小塔一羣，傳稱大塔係釋尊之塔，而小塔則爲大迦葉，目犍連等之塔。大塔式樣最古，全體用磚塊建造，成半圓之覆鉢形，遠望宛如我國之丘陵，其下建有基壇，圍成一級巡行道，連基壇之直徑爲百二十英尺，單塔身之直徑約百英尺，自地面至承露盤之高約五十六英尺。半圓形塔身頂部，於建造時本戴有丁字形之相輪，以爲裝飾，不知何時失去，印度政府特重行爲之配置矣。塔之周圍，築有石門石欄等，雕刻精美，式樣古舊，亦爲硏究家所熱心討論之對象，據中國之牌坊，即爲此種石門之蜕變云。其他有名之佛跡，如亞迦坦之石窟寺，以雕刻壁晝聞名於全世，錫蘭獅子島，西克利亞石窟寺，庫台之石窟寺等，或以其中壁晝馳名，或以其雕像著稱，今亦難一一詳述。</p>
<p>印度敎之建築</p>
<p>印度敎之藝術，乃承佛敎藝術之後而興起，故多追隨佛敎，其建築物亦復如此，印度敎之建築初被誤認爲佛敎遺蹟者，亦曾有之。當佛敎爲回敎所壓迫而被逐出印度本土之後，此新興之印度敎，以其爲印度民族信仰之代表而得保存如故。印度敎之藝術品，最長爲六世紀時之作品，其後建築雕刻等物，繼續不斷，直至今日有尙在製作中者。關於印度敎之藝術，第一可舉者爲愛落拉（Ellora）窟院第二十九號以下諸窟，其次如號爲神都之培那來史（Benares）地方，印度敎之寺院臨Ganges河邊，櫛比相連，又如孟加拉之可那拉克—黑塔寺，營造之壯麗，雕刻之離奇，令參觀者口呆目鈍，難以言傳。其餘尙多，未能縷述。此種神祠所奉之神，以婆羅門維希奴（Vishnm）希伐（Siva）爲主神，以主神之化身及神妃神眷等等副之。寺壁雕刻圖畫，多爲關於諸神威德之神話傳說。此種寺院之營迭與雕刻雖於技巧方面，日益精緻，然總不能與佛敎藝術之壯嚴氣韻相比較。例如黑塔寺殿堂之結構，雕刻之神妙，誠遠勝古代，然其羅列無數男女交會之像，則不免淫猥卑俗，信仰旣已墮落，同時藝術當亦墮落，是固無可否認者也。</p>
<p>印度建築之分期與特色</p>
<p>談印度藝術史者，往往自太古迄　多朝爲第一期，認其爲發達時期：　多朝則稱爲中期，而認爲圓熟時期，至　多朝以後，則認爲後期，乃衰頹時期矣。實則此種分期批判，並不可靠，所稱爲發達時期中之作品，即假定其缺乏圓熟技巧，然就其眞摯熱烈之氣魄言之，亦決不劣　　多朝之全盛時期也。</p>
<p>印度建築之最具特之色彩者，即爲寺塔。寺塔最初作半圓形，而爲帶有石門石攔之獨立建築物，其後積漸而成爲寺院之中心，有時又伴築伽藍。印度建築術與歐洲建築最爲相異者，爲圓室（Dome）之構造。印度圓室之楣，全係水平，亦有從兩邊柱頭交會突出之腕材（Bracker）者，而歐洲圓室乃用輻射拱石構造者也。印度腕材爲其建築要術所獨具，世之硏究家謂爲起源於特拉維達人云。至印度建築之影響於世界，自以佛教區域爲依歸，而尤以我中國最受影響，寳塔也，寺院也，以至石窟也，雖不與印度塔、印度寺、印度石窟全同，然其來源則爲印度，故無論如何加以變化，印度建築之面影終不能脫去也。</p>
<p>全印回敎大會主席哈隆逝世</p>

<p>孟買從事戰事準備</p>
<p>印度洋戰事密佈，這幾天更顯得沉重，自錫蘭島首府可侖坡及印度第三大城馬德拉斯遭空襲後，印度沿海岸的城市，須作萬一準備，紛紛疏散人口，從事必要的佈置。這在印度西部的海口，佔着二十二平方哩的面積；有七個島嶼聯綴而成的孟買城Bombay，也不能例外，據說這些日子也做人口疏散的工作了。誰都不相倌，這個城在一六六年原名King　Charles　Ⅱ，係以十個金鎊租賃而得的。（上圖）孟買城之維多利亞車站，（下圖）馬拉巴山Malabar　Hill景色。</p>

<p>柏林卄七日海通社電　德國國會昨日下午三時另八分由戈林上將宣佈開會後、元首希特勒即發表如下之演說稱、一九三九年九月德國被迫作戰、世人於釀成血戰之原因、今當已開始明瞭其眞相、是年九月三日、英法不顧德國維持和平之企圖向德宣戰、致造成今日人類之浩刦、時至今日、余殊不知英國政府於一九三三年後屢拒余樹立諒解之建議、是否爲智者所取、布爾　維克主義者有赤化世界之野心、故德國人士咸具有摧毀紅軍之決心、</p>
<p>誇陳戰績</p>
<p>東綫戰事經過寒冬之後、德軍陣勢益見穩定、溯自西班牙內戰以來、已使歐洲靑年警悟布爾雪維克之危機、故蘇聯欲在此次戰爭中乘機漁利之企圖、今巳爲德義匈三國所挫敗猶太資本主義之民主國家今竟與蘇聯駢肩作戰、究其目的乃欲保特其剝削人類之權慾、但被壓迫民族今已聯合一致、同爲自由與獨立而作戰、以解決衆人之麵包問題、此次戰爭當能在東戰塲決定其結果、德國在此次戰爭中已屢建驚人之戰績、波蘭挪威荷蘭比利時法國已先後爲吾軍所征服、在北非則有義軍與吾軍駢肩作戰、塞爾維亞之叛變亦即爲吾軍所敉平、希臘英軍經吾軍加以痛擊之後、亦即不支潰退、蘇軍企國威脅德　邊境、亦未獲逞、敵方船隻被　擊沉者迄今已有一千六百萬噸之多、凡此種種早巳震驚世人、今則更有英勇之日本在東亞獲得勝利之進展、</p>
<p>艱苦作戰</p>
<p>東綫戰事吾軍因氣候嚴寒無法作戰　遂不得不改到守勢、同時乘此機會補充實力、以待春季之決戰、蓋一八　二年時、拿破崙進兵莫斯科、卒因嚴寒關係致　覆滅、當時最低溫度在冰點下二十五度、上年冬季東綫之最低溫度、則在冰點下五十二度、由此可知東綫德軍將士堅苦情形之一斑、芬軍與吾軍在東棧駢肩作戰、共禦赤禍、亦卓著勞績、迄今勝利信心未稍動搖、殊爲吾人所欽敬、西班牙軍團亦與吾軍在前綫同甘苦、吾人對之、敬佩之心實無以復加、其他軍團如匈牙利·期洛伐克·克羅特之將士、亦堅苦備嘗、履行解放世界之偉大任務、義大利軍隊亦能在　東綫堅守陣地、挫敗蘇軍之進攻、羅馬尼亞軍團之英勇、亦爲吾人同聲景仰、由此可知吾人已與歐洲民族團結一致、誓必摧毀蘇聯赤化世界之威脅、共謀人類之安全、</p>
<p>要求特權</p>
<p>歐洲各民族協力對共同之敵人作戰、德國之衝鋒隊及法·比·立陶宛·拉脫維亞·愛沙尼亞·烏克蘭之軍隊、均參加對布爾雪維克之戰爭、芬蘭及義國之空軍、亦重創敵軍、余以德國人民賦與之權力、作重要之　定、余與全體將士對於全國民衆之擁護領袖、表示謝意、前綫之困苦、爲吾人之敎訓、余將採取各項必要之措置、防止再度遭受此項困苦、今年冬季、德軍將有較好之鐵路·機車·坦克車·拖車·及卡車、汝等當不致懷疑余之決心、余望德國民衆使余具有要求民衆絕對服從之權力、藉以完成更偉大之任務、前綫與後方、均須服從爭取勝利之唯一原則、目前任何個人、不能堅持各項特權、每一個人、均應認識目前唯有責任而已、余要求德國國會、明白規定、余在法律上、具有使任何人盡其責任、並懲罰不盡責任者之權力、此項權力之行使、僅涉及千百萬民衆之少數而已、前綫將士及後方工人、要求請假、余有加以拒絕之權、因一九三三年以後、余未曾有三日之假期、冬季已過、東綫僵持之局勢將結束、歷史將　定誰爲冬季戰事之勝利者矣、</p>
<p>海空戰爭</p>
<p>希特勒繼就空戰方式及潛水艇戰爭有所闡明、略謂、「余並不畏懼英美兩國之將領、惟英國倘欲以新式武器、賡續從事空戰　毒平民、則余不得不在此際、說明余對於空戰所抱之態度、查空戰之發生、邱吉爾本人實爲始作俑者、渠於一九四〇年五月間首先空襲、但當時余僅予以警吿、並等待其幡然覺悟凡四月之久、終因其執迷不悟、而使余不得不有所行動、於是彼發動空戰之人、反而大感恐慌矣、時至此際、余願再事忍耐、以覘其未來行動、惟此種態度、並非示弱、茲當警吿此人、切勿任性再起恐慌、渠巳使余不得不出以報復手段、其結果徒使其人民遭受極大痛苦、自今厥後、余决以打擊還打擊、直至此種罪行絕跡之時而後已、此項工作、將與其人同時吿終、抑余對於將來具有絕大信念、東綫戰爭、自當賡續進行、非至摧毀蘇維埃巨象、決不休止、同時吾人仍當以潛水艇、與英國賡續作戰、一九三九年秋、邱吉爾曾向英國人民發表演說、謂潛水艇之威脅已被征服云、實則此際余敢斷言、潛水艇仍將迫使英國屈膝、不問邱吉爾如何說法、余能向諸君保證、吾人擁有大批潛水艇、其數目較上次世界大戰時爲多、事實上吾人已擁有戰勝所需之一切條件、倘若不幸失敗、我國民族勢將從此　終正　、結果將使野蠻主義風行全歐、與十五世紀前之歐洲將無二致、關於此層、德國士兵知之最諗、英國在現行戰爭中、必將一無所得、甚至勢將喪失一切、最後當可明瞭民族國家之命運、決不可委諸官僚、眞理必能戰勝、而眞理實爲我方所有、當此我國歷史上最偉大之時期、余能領導日耳曼民族共同奮鬥、頗足自豪、茲願無條件的將奈之姓名及生命與國人之命運相聯繫、余對於上帝、除請其爲吾人之後代祝福而外、別無他求、惟仍希望上帝能假余以歲月、以待我民族奮鬥之完成云、（哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<h3>基督教難童教養院　籌謀擴充經費困難　自難胞收容所進行解散後　難童要求入院者未便固拒</h3>
<p>本埠哥倫比亞路蔣家弄基督敎難童敎養院、成立迄今、已逾兩載、所收容者均係顚沛流離之孤兒難童、其宗旨即在敎育優秀兒童、培養健全國民、以延續民族之生命元氣、而使彼輩不致淪爲人類之贅瘤、增加社會之負担、目前收容難童總數共有五十名左右、祇以糧食供應頗感困難、遂有募捐經費之舉、</p>
<p>以往歷史</p>
<p>該院最初係由美國教會曼英女士（Mrs．Main）主辦、在哥倫比亞路租地數畝、自建屋宇多橡、有敎室宿舍醫藥室禮拜堂等、過去會由虞洽卿氏捐贈西貢米十包、紅十字會贈以米麥、中國紗廠捐施布十六疋棉四百斤、各項給麥賴以維持、迨至今春、美僑由滬撒退、始由本國敎會人士李百强黃蘭玉許紹棣等設立董事會、繼續辦理、原定收容難童及孤兒三十人、而各方保送者絡繹不絕、如工部局兒童保障科所收留之貧苦兒童、亦歸該院敎養、</p>
<p>目前頭部</p>
<p>目前收容人數、總數已逹三十名、內男孩三十四名、女孩十六名、年齡均在六七歲至十四歲之間、按照目前敎養各項、每一靴童月需二十五元左右、而其中米糧問題尤爲嚴重、該院所需食米約四包、計費一千三百元、佔經費之大宗、以是深感給養爲難、該院近更因難胞收容所多在進行解散、難童之要求入院者尤术便固絕、茲擬就該院空地添建敎室宿舍、以資容納、如米糧問題獲得解決、即可擴充名額、</p>
<p>呼籲捐助</p>

<h3>一家小麵店　從中午坐到黃昏　三個沒落的外國醫生　吃一餐鮮美的中國麵</h3>
<p>有這末一天，百老匯路畔一家小麵店裹，三個外國人圍着小圓桌坐着，面前各有麵一碗，熱氣騰騰，麵香四溢，他們靜悄悄地吃着，不過很費力似的，因爲兩根光滑的筷子，在他們手中，簡直像執着千斤重担，有力使不出來，運用極不靈便。其他顧客，都是碼頭小工，和人力車夫之類的華人，運用筷子，熟極生巧，即使夾着滑溜溜的麵條，也毫不費事。</p>
<p>漸漸地，顧客陸續離開店堂，回附近的碼頭槓貨去了，單調的「杭唷」之聲，一陣陣地傳來。三個外國人好容易把麵裝進肚子，飽餐已畢時，店堂裹的顧客，幾乎都已散盡了。</p>
<p>他是一位名醫呢</p>
<p>「這一餐多鮮美呀！」一個外國人從　　不堪的上衣口袋裏掏出手帕，輕輕揩着薄薄的嘴唇這麼說。此人年已不輕了，兩鬢呈銀灰色，看來已有五十歲光景：可是他的雙手却整齊有致，伸出在汚舊的袖管外，很不相稱，原來這是一雙名醫的手呢。米契爾·伊凡諾維支·耶勃朗斯基醫師便是他，曾在歐美大學專攻醫科，着實有些名望。來到上海後，也會懸壺應診，怎奈不懂得大吹大擂的訣巧，因此診所裹冷冷淸淸，情况日非，才抛却本行，另覓生路。</p>
<p>同桌的夥伴，有一個是德人，名柯德·許萊辛格，矮胖，禿頂，鼻架厚邊眼鏡，也是個醫生，因沒法糊口，才改業謀生。另一個是波蘭人强恩·浦林卡，五十開外年紀，一頭金黃色的頭髮，兩顆綠澄澄的眼珠，曾得醫學博士，他的專長是屍體防腐術，現在却也拋棄了這行當。</p>
<p>吃了四個禮拜了</p>
<p>「眞奇怪」，浦博士用三人都懂得的德語說，「這種中國麵似乎是很優美的食物，我已吃了四個禮拜，非但還不生厭，而且有終生以此爲食的胃口呢。」</p>
<p>慢爭論新的問題</p>
<p>德人許醫師却帶着不屑一聽的神氣說：「麵雖有充飢的功用，但缺少人體必要的維他命，鈣，燐，和其他重要的營養成份。」許醫師振振有辭，總脫不了從前講學時的氣概。</p>
<p>「親愛的夥伴們，」俄人耶醫師插嘴道：「用慢爭論新問題，我們昨天討論的肺胃神經病問題，還沒解決呢。我始終主張應先從神經冶療着手。」</p>
<p>豈不躭誤了性命</p>
<p>許醫師和浦博士的精神，爲之一振，把椅子更向圓桌拖近些，凝神靜聽耶醫師的高論。等他說完，許醫師伸聳一聳肩膀，機械地把眼鏡抬高一些</p>
<p>「耶勃朗斯基先生，我已向你說過不知多少回了，病人需要立刻施以局部診治，你却主張先施一般的治療，這是絕大的錯誤，豈不躭誤病人的性命。恕我直，你的主張不合科學規則，簡直要不得。」</p>
<p>「我以爲兩位都錯了」，浦博十不耐煩地說：「依我的意見，應該先從病人的强健着想，身體是…」</p>
<p>其餘兩人都有些憤然。耶醫師忍不住用譏笑的口吻道：「你看吧，夥伴先生，我們的友人又在提起身體了，死屍防腐人舉究不脫本色。自說自話，何必聽信。」</p>
<p>消磨了一個下午</p>
<p>整個下半天，就這未消逝了，薄暮時分的夕陽，愈移愈斜，街燈也放光了，還三位外國醫生圍坐着，桌子上放些處方和化學方程式的紙片，還在一本正經地討論着治療方法，彷彿桌子旁邊躺着病人，正待他們決定命運似的。</p>
<p>碼頭小工的一天工作已畢，紛紛夾進晚餐，麵店老闆不得不下逐客令了，這三位醫師還是滿不在意地熱烈議論着，直到老闆大聲咆哮，才把議論打斷。耶醫師站起身來，仲個懶腰，說：「天曉得，我竟忘了兜銷鞋帶了。」</p>
<p>許醫師若有所悟，說：「我也忘了做買賣，你知道，我賣的是精美的衣料。」</p>
<p>浦博士笑道：「閣下都是學識淵博的醫師，却賣鞋帶衣料。我倒還司以靠舊本領賺錢，那天有個王阿三，死了老母，我去料理屍體，事後送我五塊錢酬勞。今天辰光不早，再會了。」</p>
<h3>轎式橡皮輪馬車</h3>
<p>種轎式馬車，驟視之好像一輛普通的汽車，把車前頭的水箱和引擎截去了。沒有馬達的汽車，怎能在馬路上走呢？其實簡單得很，圖中的馬，舉着前蹄，得得向前，豈非名符其實的「馬達麽？你看叫個輪子，氣打得足足的，滾在三合土基的柏油路上，由一匹風神俊逸的白馬挽着，不疾不徐地前進，四平八穩，眞是再舒服也沒有了。這種馬車的車頂，如果能够像汽車般的隨意移動，那末在風和日暖的早晨移開了車頂板，放下了車窗，在寬廣的大道，如靜安寺路，霞飛路一帶兜上幾個圈子，不是也很够怡神「納」福麼？</p>

<h3>同感</h3>
<p>— 維城</p>
<p>軋米巳非易事，再要在道軋來的「一升」博蠅頭之利，更是大難。有人說爲了道些「軋米黨」，才使眞正要軋米的人無從「插足」，　確也是事實，不過，誰不是眞正要軋米的人呢？「軋米黨」忍着肌膚之痛，去而復來，來而復去，肚子裹或許已餓得要吐出淸水來了。</p>
<p>儲備票要五元的找。法幣却是要單塊的，甚至兩個「聯號」的人合起來，也是五元票不要，我不知米店家向棧房出米的時候，是否捧了上千的單票的？不過，現在不是講理的時候，一講理，人已經離開了長蛇陣。軋一升米，豈是容易的？</p>
<p>過去，有過「手槍走火」的故事，現在也發生了「倒地氣絕」的悲劇，爲了吃飯，嗚呼痛哉！</p>
<p>「香港恢復賽馬」，見諸電文，就引起人們紛紛談論；眼前的事，反而是司空見慣了。如果易地以處，我想彼此有同感吧！</p>
<h3>推測</h3>
<p>— 爾冬</p>
<p>閱微草堂筆記引李雲舉言：「有人富甲一鄕，積粟千餘石，遇歲歉，閉不肯　。忽一日，微集僕隸，陳設概量，手書一紅　，榜於門曰：「歲歉人飢，何心獨飽？今擬以歷年積粟，盡貸鄕鄰；每人以一石爲律，即日各具囊篋赴領，遲則粟盡矣。」附近居民，聞聲雲合，不一日而粟盡。有請見主人申謝者，則主人不知所往矣。惶遽大索，乃得於久歸敝屋中，酣眠方熟，人至始欠伸，衆驚愕掖起，於身畔得一紙曰：「積而不散，怨之府也；怨之所歸，禍之叢也。千家飢而一家飽，剽刦爲勢所必至，不名實而亡乎？感君舊德，爲君市德。希恕專擅，是所深　！不省何言何事；詢知始末，太息而巳。然是人情洶洶，實有焚掠之謀，得是博施，乃轉禍爲福。此幻形之妖（狐也）？可謂愛人以德矣。……</p>
<p>讀後，使我想起了曾爲孟嘗君市義的馮煖來。</p>
<p>馮　「市義」，可以見諸史載：狐精「市德」，祇能看作寓言。然而，馮煖這種可愛的人，求諸今日，恐怕踏破鐵鞋也沒法覓到的；大概古代還有一種「古道可風」，今日則人心不大古了吧。是耶非耶，不敢貿斷。</p>
<p>天堂之類的宗敎，有人說是人們因爲苦於現實，夢想求得一種精神上的安慰與靈的寄托，才產生出的。此說假如可信，那麼神學或者在最近的將來要特別的盛起來。</p>
<p>這當然是一種推想，不過也有理由可申說的。</p>
<p>「歲歉人飢」，獨飽的人，不僅「積而不散」，並且過大囤而特囤；市義的人旣然絕跡，人們不得不退而希望世間眞能有種「爲人市德」的「幻形之妖」了。</p>
<p>我雖不敢預言，不過上面推測的倒極可能成爲事實。</p>
<h3>候</h3>
<p>— 星雲</p>
<p>據說以前張良和黃石老人約會，張良第一次平明而去，老人巳先在；第二次鷄鳴而去，老人又巳先在；第三次未到半夜而去，始比老人先至。</p>
<p>現在去「軋米」，平明而去當然沒有你的份；鷄鳴而去也未見得有份；所以只得半夜便去候在米店旁邊。</p>
<p>但是，張良候到的是「平天下」的「太公兵法」，而我們所候到的僅僅是尙不能聊以果腹的一升米罷了。</p>
<h3>三「本」何在</h3>
<p>— 方勝兒</p>
<p>從前，一位實業家有名言曰：「做生意的人，須有三本：一是本心，二是本錢，三是本領。」當時稱之爲「三本主義」。</p>
<p>本心是良心，「商業道德」是也。本錢是資本，「商業資本」是也。本領是能力，「商業知識」再加上經騐，是頗爲抽象，但不可缺少的一種從事商業的力量。</p>
<p>可是試看今日「做生意」的，對於囤積之道，研究有素，昔日囤米今日囤藥，本心何在？而賣空買空，本錢何在？至於本領，則旣不「管理」甚麽，又不須「計劃」甚麽，只是在電話盤裏「翻筋斗」，「徵求」「出售」　裏踱方步，本領又何在？然而這也是做生意，嗚呼！</p>

<h3>失業紀聞</h3>
<p>— 公鷄</p>
<p>失業了。</p>
<p>失業後第一椿可以滿意的事，是可以自由自在的睡覺。以前因爲限時限刻地趕上公事房，天天終有些睏不淸。爬在寫字樓上瞌睡，固然事實不許，然而哈欠連連，似乎也有傷大雅。現在好了，一不必用閙鐘，二不必托叫喊，儘由自己高興，裏在熱被窩裏，睡到日高三竿。</p>
<p>張開眼睛，首先看見的是陲在自己和妻中問的三歲小巴戲，已經撐大了黑眼珠對房頂出神。</p>
<p>「叫爸爸。」</p>
<p>「不叫，！小巴戲有倔强的精神。</p>
<p>「不叫不買糖給你吃。」</p>
<p>「爸爸。」</p>
<p>自己笑了。妻也被笑聲所驚醒。然而聯想到父子的關係，也不過是一種經濟問題，不覺有些悵惘。</p>
<p>起身的漱口洗臉吃點心三部曲奏完之後，先拿起當天的報紙來溜覽溜覽。雖說失業，報紙仍舊照訂。據說報紙是文化的食糧，假若一天不死，這文化食糧有繼續享受一天的必要，我看報紙先看政治新聞。並不是故意裝作關心國家大事，實在因爲國家大事有關心的必要。次則看經濟新聞。因爲雖是失業，個人還有一點商業上來往。何况偶而也往所謂市塲之類的地方跑跑。新聞看完，再看廣吿，我向來注意小廣吿，尤其注意徵求欄內的「微婚」或「徵友」，並不是想應微，實在是常有「奇文」可賞。現在是被「徵求」與「出售」弄得頭昏腦脹了。</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（四）　殘照裏</p>
<p>國芳極力在遷就維城說的不曾沾染什麼習氣，把話放低了程度，一邊笑一邊說道；「我只有個哥哥，沒有個姊姊，就認爲翠珍姊做姊姊吧。翠珍道：「城弟，你看陳小姐，把我抬舉到這個地步，叫我說些什麽話呢？」維城道：一國芳也是個心直口快的人，她輕易也不肯隨便恭維人，所惜我是遭了大故，不然，在道新年裏，國器和國芳同來，我們是何等的快樂：現在心裏亂得不知所云，國芳來了，覺得好一些。」翠珍聽說話聲音中斷了，她又一站，說：「你們坐，我是勞動慣了的，不會這麼端端正正坐着。我聽聲音，好像大姑媽來了。」維城道：「哦，她們來談開喪問題的。」翠珍走了，他也走出去看大姑奶奶。但不特大姑奶奶來，厲叉榭也來，他們在談着如何辦理喪事，國芳倒覺得有些不安起來了。</p>
<p>是葉家的至親，在談着必耍的事，談完了也都走了。維城來告訴國芳道；「先母的開喪日期，已經決定在陰曆二月初二舉辦，現在得忙印訃聞，讓我檢也先父去世時的訃聞，和戚友家送來的訃聞，做參玫。後邊還該有個哀啟，你幫着我做。」國芳連忙搖手道。「這個事情我辦不了，這是應用文。學校裏雖然每兩星期有一課應用文，由教師寫在黑板上，叫我們抄下來，可是誰願意去抄呢？尤其是報喪條，訃聞，哀啟，送喪禮的那些文字，同學誰都不願意去抄。一位同學，是蘇州人，她說的兇，說誰要抄了，就是預備死老子娘用，所以誰都沒有去注意。你要問我，就是問道於盲。我只知道父母死了，稱孤哀子；父親死了，稱孤子；母親死了，稱哀子。，什麽泣血稽類泣血稽首，便鬧不清楚。你要問我，還是婚禮比較的有一些頭緒，因爲我做過兩次女儐相，一次被推爲女賓代表致頌詞。婚禮，鞠躬鞠錯了，不過大家一笑；，弄錯了可不成。」（六一）</p>
<h3>單鈔缺乏的原因</h3>
<p>— 蹣跚</p>
<p>最近，市面上的單鈔又感到不敷了。向銀行裹的朋友掉掉，他們都回答說：「連自己用用都沒有。」問問四川路小錢莊，貼水掛牌已高至每百十塊了。同一銀行的幣制，竟要打上個九折，眞使人不敢置信</p>
<p>踏進小麵館叫碗陽春麵，堂倌就會問你是否帶單鈔；假使你回答說沒有，他就不客氣地請你出來了，理由是－－五塊頭我不出。</p>
<p>那末，單鈔到那裏去了呢？</p>
<p>有人囤積着是無疑的，但單鈔不是銀幣和鎳幣，有它本身的副價値」在內，一鎔化了就可派別的用塲。它之所以被囤積居奇，可見別有原因。</p>
<p>報紙讀罷，吃中飯也是時候了。失業以來，久已實行一菜一湯主義。偶而也買斤把肉吃吃。然而買菜娘姨常常被肉攤老闆認爲是生面孔，而斤兩特別扣尅。不論紅燒白煮，放在碗裏終是可憐相。但是飯量並不因菜少米貴而减低，三碗到肚，才能罷休。據說「荒年大肚皮」，由此看來，信而有徵。</p>
<p>飯後光陰，最是難熬。上電影院或話　塲，偶一爲之，固非不可。倘要排日前往，變成看戲職業化，未免大背失業經濟原理。悶在家裏，三缺一的麻將不會，小說雜誌不是巳經看過，便是太濫竽充數。再三思維，祇有拔起脚來，馬路上蕩蕩。大道如砥，其直如矢。旣無買路錢之需索，還可以看看摩登女郞，何樂不爲？賞鑒賞鑒蜜斯們眉毛，剃光之後，畫以炭筆，有的像初三夜裏的月牙，有的畫成直錢一條，我常常懷疑，是蜜斯們要在臉上證明兩點之間直綫最短的幾何原理。兩頰塗得紅紅地，塗勻的也還罷了，有些獨紅兩塊顴骨，令人有奇峯突出之感。除了人以外，物也大有可看。你看那窗櫉裹的Ｃａｋｅ，就是已經吃飽了飯，也想來一個。木器店的傢具，看了一眼，便捨不得走開。立在樂器店前，聽聽放送的唱片，也可以冒充有音樂的天才。到了走得腿疲力盡，不妨到電影院的過廳裏立一立，好在衣衫不十分襤褸，電影院的Ｂｏｙ，一心以爲你買好了票，等候另一位相好光臨，而且兩壁電影照片，大可以一破岑寂，興盡歸來，破沙發上一靠，恭候晚餐。</p>
<p>吃完晚餐，早早睡覺。明天天亮，我再來消磨這失業的光陰。</p>
<p>這原因我們不妨站在囤積者的立塲來探究一下，其結論也許正是他們的動機。由於戰事的影響，上海生活必需品的存底是日益减少了，爲着市民的福利，工部局開始對米·油·麵粉，苞米粉等規定限價和購買量，於是單鈔的需要急增，因爲一長列一長列在米店門前鵠候着的，手裏非握有單鈔不可。於是聰明人開始動腦筋了，覺着有利可圖，就暗下收買，小錢莊聞風響應，不甘或後，於是各門市商店收入的單鈔不肯出籠，連各色點心攤也貼起「兩塊以上起找的字條來了。加以電車賣票，趁火打刦，由是乎單鈔成爲商品，和美票，軍票一樣的有行問市了。</p>
<p>「始作俑者；其無後乎。」但這種咒駡是沒有用的，唯一的辦法是增加單鈔的發行量，使囤者無所用其技。</p>
<p>要知道－－疏通來源是一切囤戶的致命傷。</p>

<h3>American Authorities Announce: East Coast Designated as a Military Zone; Area from Canadian Border to Florida Under Strict Military Control</h3>
<p>New York, 26th (Havas) – Eastern Coastal Defense Commander Lieutenant General Drum has declared that the Atlantic coast, from the Canadian border to Florida, is now designated as a military zone. This is to implement military control, prevent destructive actions, and hinder enemy activities. The management will be carried out through a district system, with restrictions placed on army, navy, and commercial facilities within each district if required for national defense and security, to prevent accidents. Furthermore, the defense headquarters will issue orders at any time to restrain the actions of foreigners and those deemed to endanger national security, but there is no plan to大規模 evacuate enemy aliens from the area.</p>
<p>New York, 17th (Reuters) – Lieutenant General Drum, Commander of the Eastern Defense Zone and the First Army Corps, announced that military authorities will establish an Eastern Military Control Zone along the entire Atlantic coast from Maine to Florida. This is a wartime security measure. The commanders of the four U.S. military districts now control all coastal lights within their respective jurisdictions. Military authorities have announced that it is not necessary to evacuate all enemy aliens from the zone, but some individuals will be designated for forced evacuation. The purpose of establishing the military control zone is to prevent conspiratorial activities and aid to the enemy. The headquarters of the four U.S. military districts are located in Boston, New York, Baltimore, and Atlanta.</p>
<p>US Aid to New Zealand Already En Route</p>
<p>Washington, 17th (Haitong News Agency) – New Zealand Minister to the US, Nash, stated in a broadcast speech to his countrymen in the US yesterday that US aid to New Zealand is already en route. New Zealand is the last bastion of Australia, and US aircraft and troops will soon join our battle.</p>
<p>Soviet-New Zealand Consular Exchange Under Consideration</p>
<p>Wellington, 27th (Reuters) – New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser announced today that the exchange of consular representatives between New Zealand and the Soviet Union is now under consideration by the New Zealand government. From a trade perspective, this matter is not urgent, but the New Zealand government will give very favorable consideration to any suggestions from the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>US Troops Occupy French Island; Vichy Lodges Protest; de Gaulle Expresses Welcome; Future of Madagascar Worth Watching</h3>
<p>Vichy, 26th (Havas) – After the landing of US troops on the French island of New Caledonia in the South Pacific, the French government, while acknowledging that the island is currently under the control of French dissidents, insists that France has never relinquished its territorial sovereignty. Therefore, the US military's unauthorized landing has prompted the French government to instruct its ambassador to the US, Henry-Haye, to lodge a strong protest with the US government.</p>
<p>London, 27th (Reuters) – After the US military occupied French New Caledonia in the Pacific, General de Gaulle telegraphed Major General Patch, the commander of the US forces, expressing welcome for the joint defense of the island by the US military and the Free French forces. Major General Patch has also telegraphed back, expressing his delight.</p>
<p>Bern, 26th (Havas) – Local newspapers recently reported that the severance of diplomatic relations between the Union of South Africa and France could create a problem for French Madagascar. The island is located east of Portuguese Mozambique, near the Union of South Africa, and in the southwestern Indian Ocean, making it strategically important. German political figures, noting that the Mediterranean Sea and the Suez Canal have lost their value as safe lines of communication, are paying close attention to French Madagascar, which effectively controls the route from Europe to India and Australia. They also believe that the severance of relations between the Union of South Africa and France could promote the development of war in the Indian Ocean, which could determine the fate of the British Empire. The Union of South Africa's decision to sever diplomatic relations with France can be seen as a preliminary step towards an attack on Madagascar. However, France has a fleet stationed on the island, and French authorities have taken precautions, potentially sending warships from Toulon to reinforce the defense. London is also very concerned about French Madagascar. According to sources in the capital of the Union of South Africa, it is not impossible for the Union to attempt to occupy French Madagascar, but officials in both Britain and Germany have declined to comment on the matter.</p>
<p>Vichy, 27th (Havas) – Foreign radio stations have issued misleading reports with ulterior motives, exaggerating the situation on the French island of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. The French Information Bureau today officially stated that the situation on the island is calm and normal, and the rumors are entirely unfounded.</p>
<h3>New Japanese Ambassador to France Presents Credentials; Pétain Receives US Ambassador</h3>
<p>Vichy, 27th (Havas) – The newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to France, Mitani, accompanied by military attachés from the army and navy, as well as embassy officials, presented his credentials to Marshal Pétain this morning. They had a meeting for about ten minutes, with French Prime Minister Laval also in attendance. As Ambassador Mitani and his delegation arrived at and departed from Marshal Pétain's office at the Séville Villa, a battalion of French soldiers presented arms in salute.</p>
<p>Vichy, 27th (Havas) – Marshal Pétain is scheduled to receive US Ambassador Admiral Leahy at 4:30 PM today. Prime Minister Laval is also scheduled to meet with Ambassador Leahy in the afternoon. Ambassador Leahy is scheduled to return to the United States next week to report for duty.</p>
<h3>Molotov Receives Sato and Cripps</h3>
<p>Ankara, 27th (Haitong News Agency) – Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov received the new Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sato, on Sunday afternoon. Molotov also received British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Stafford Cripps, on the same day.</p>
<h3>Soviet-Japanese Relations: Eastern Newspaper Quite Anxious About Soviet Ambassador's Failure to Arrive</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Haitong News Agency) – The "Hochi Shimbun" detailed Japan's international relations and paid close attention to Japanese-Soviet relations. It stated that Japan's policy toward the Soviet Union is based on the Neutrality Pact concluded between the two countries. The fact that the Soviet Ambassador to Japan has not arrived in the past three months should be noted. Whether to reinstate the old ambassador or appoint a new one should be decided as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Large Number of Aircraft Fly Over Tokyo; Originally Belonged to Japan</h3>

<h3>Japan's Wartime Financial Situation: People's Burden Increases</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Haitong News Agency) – Japanese Finance Minister Kaya stated in a speech to the Diet election preparatory meeting tonight that Japan has completed all necessary preparations for the development of the East Asian War. In the five years since the outbreak of the China Incident, Japan's finances have made great progress. At that time, government bonds had reached 800 million yen, and the general public believed that if the amount of government bonds reached 1 billion yen, the crisis would be unimaginable. However, today, the Japanese people subscribe to 1 billion yen worth of government bonds annually. In order to ensure the smooth conclusion of the East Asian War, it is planned to increase this to 2 billion yen annually.</p>
<h3>Canada to Decide on Overseas Deployment of Troops via Plebiscite</h3>
<p>Ottawa, 26th (Havas) – A plebiscite will be held in Canada tomorrow regarding the lifting of the federal government's restriction on sending conscripts to fight abroad. Women will also be able to vote. Voters simply need to write "Yes" or "No" in response to the question: "Do you agree to lift the various restrictions imposed on the government regarding conscription?" The governing party is actively campaigning, urging the public to accept the government's proposal. Prime Minister Mackenzie King has even announced that if the government's proposal is rejected, the cabinet will resign, stating that until now, only volunteers could go overseas to fight, while conscripts could not leave the country. By holding this plebiscite, the government deeply hopes that the people will understand the needs of the overall situation and grant the government the power to act freely to deal with various issues that may arise from the war in the future. Opposition parties such as the Conservative Party and the Social Credit Party initially opposed holding a plebiscite, but have now changed their attitude to support the government, urging party members to vote in favor of the Prime Minister's proposal.</p>
<h3>White House Calls Meeting of Congressional Leaders; Important Meeting to Discuss Anti-Inflation Policy; Treasury to Begin Bond Drive</h3>
<p>Washington, 26th (Havas) – President Roosevelt is scheduled to convene an important meeting with congressional leaders at the White House tomorrow to discuss the message that the President plans to submit to Congress. Although the content is unknown, political circles speculate that it will be nothing more than a discussion of the outline of preventing inflation. The main points are: Freeze all prices at the level of March 1 of this year; Price Administrator Henderson will formulate detailed measures, which are expected to be announced within the next week; Strictly limit wartime profits, and some restrictions will also be placed on salaries; Encourage people to purchase government bonds and defense bonds. The Treasury Department is scheduled to begin a fundraising campaign on the 28th of this month, requiring all American citizens with fixed incomes to purchase government bonds with 10/10000 of their income. According to the observations of prominent American economists, this is the most effective way to absorb currency and will greatly benefit the government's anti-inflation policy.</p>

<h3>9. Temples and Architecture of India (Part 2)</h3>
<p>The Sanchi Stupa is the oldest and most famous stupa in India. Its construction date is difficult to determine, but it is said to have been built in the second half of the second century BC. According to legend, King Ashoka ruled 84,000 countries and ordered all countries to build 84,000 temples and 84,000 stupas, of which the Sanchi Stupa is one. In addition to the Great Stupa, there is also a group of smaller stupas, which are said to be the stupas of Shakyamuni Buddha (釋尊) and the Great Disciples Mahākāśyapa (大迦葉), Maudgalyāyana (目犍連), etc. The Great Stupa has the oldest style, entirely built of bricks, forming a semi-circular hemispherical shape, resembling our country's hills from a distance. Below it is a base, forming a single-level circumambulation path. The diameter including the base is 120 feet, the diameter of the stupa body alone is about 100 feet, and the height from the ground to the chattras (承露盤) is about 56 feet. The top of the semi-circular stupa body originally had a T-shaped finial as decoration, but it was lost at some unknown time, and the Indian government has specially reconfigured it. The stupa is surrounded by stone gates and stone railings, with exquisite carvings and old styles, which are also the object of keen discussion by researchers. According to China's paifang (牌坊), it is a transformation of this type of stone gate. Other famous Buddhist sites, such as the Ajanta cave temples, are famous throughout the world for their sculptures and murals, and the Sigiriya cave temples in Ceylon (Sri Lanka), and the Kutai cave temples, etc., are either famous for their murals or known for their statues, which are difficult to describe in detail.</p>
<p>Architecture of Hinduism</p>
<p>Hindu art arose after Buddhist art, so it mostly followed Buddhism, and its buildings were also the same. Hindu buildings were once mistaken for Buddhist relics. After Buddhism was oppressed by Islam and driven out of the Indian mainland, this newly emerging Hinduism was preserved as the representative of the Indian national faith. The longest Hindu artworks are from the sixth century, and subsequent buildings, sculptures, etc., continued until today, and some are still being made. Regarding Hindu art, the first to mention is the Ellora cave temples below cave number 29, followed by the Benares (培那來史) area, known as the City of Gods (神都), where Hindu temples are lined up along the Ganges River. Also, the Konark Sun Temple (黑塔寺) in Bengal, the magnificence of its construction, and the strangeness of its carvings, leave visitors speechless. There are many others that cannot be listed one by one. The gods enshrined in these shrines are mainly Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, supplemented by the incarnations of the main gods and their consorts and retinues. The temple wall carvings and paintings are mostly myths and legends about the power and virtue of the gods. Although the construction and carving of this type of temple are becoming more and more refined in terms of technique, they cannot be compared with the solemn spirit of Buddhist art. For example, the structure of the Black Pagoda Temple Hall and the wonderful carvings are far superior to ancient times, but the countless images of men and women meeting are inevitably obscene and vulgar. Since the faith has degenerated, at the same time, the art must also degenerate, which is undeniable.</p>
<p>Periodization and Characteristics of Indian Architecture</p>
<p>Those who discuss the history of Indian art often regard the period from ancient times to the Gupta Dynasty (多朝) as the first period, considering it the developmental stage; the Maurya Dynasty (多朝) is called the middle period, and is considered the mature stage; and after the Gupta Dynasty (多朝), it is considered the later period, which is the declining stage. In fact, this kind of periodization and criticism is not reliable. The works in the so-called developmental stage, even assuming that they lack mature skills, are by no means inferior to the heyday of the Gupta Dynasty (　　多朝) in terms of their sincere and enthusiastic spirit.</p>
<p>The most distinctive feature of Indian architecture is the temple tower. The temple tower was originally semi-circular and was an independent building with stone gates and stone railings. Later, it gradually became the center of the temple, and sometimes a sangharama (伽藍) was built. The most different thing between Indian architecture and European architecture is the structure of the dome. The lintels of Indian domes are all horizontal, and there are also brackets (腕材) protruding from the capitals of the pillars on both sides, while European domes are constructed with radiating arch stones. Indian brackets are unique to its architectural essentials. Researchers in the world say that they originated from the Dravidians. As for the influence of Indian architecture on the world, it is based on the Buddhist region, and especially China is most influenced. Pagodas, temples, and even grottoes are not exactly the same as Indian stupas, Indian temples, and Indian grottoes, but their source is India. Therefore, no matter how much they are changed, the image of Indian architecture cannot be removed.</p>

<p>Bombay Prepares for War</p>
<p>With the Indian Ocean war looming, these days seem even heavier. Since the capital of Ceylon, Colombo, and India's third largest city, Madras, were bombed, the coastal cities of India must be prepared for the worst, evacuating the population and carrying out necessary arrangements. In the seaboard of western India, occupying 22 square miles, there is the city of Bombay, consisting of seven islands linked together. It is not an exception; it is said that the population evacuation is also being done in these days. No one believed that this city was originally named King Charles Ⅱ in 1666 and was obtained by renting it for ten pounds.

<h3>US Business Circles Strongly Advocate Developing Inland Waterway Transportation to Avoid Coastal Navigation Hazards Due to Active Axis Submarines</h3>
<p>Washington, 26th (Havas) - As the number of American merchant ships sunk by Axis submarines along the Atlantic coast increases daily, various parties are calling for the immediate development of inland waterway transportation to avoid the dangers of coastal navigation. It has been thirty-five years since American business circles demanded the dredging of domestic canals and the increase in inland riverboats, but without success. Now, they all believe that the transportation of heavy goods cannot solely rely on coastal shipping and that more canals should be built to ensure better transportation between the eastern coastal areas and the Midwest, South, and Southwest. The initial work includes: adjusting canal equipment, building a large number of barges, laying oil pipelines, and opening a new canal across Florida to transport crude oil produced in Texas to the north. In addition, the Midwestern states have always transported all goods via mountain railways, resulting in high freight costs, which are significantly higher than the low freight costs for goods transported by coastal shipping in the eastern coastal states. Therefore, they also strongly support the development of inland waterway transportation.</p>
<p>Washington, 26th (Havas) - According to the Navy Department, an American merchant ship of ordinary tonnage was sunk by enemy torpedoes near the Atlantic coast. There were no casualties, and all the sailors have landed in a port in the east.</p>

<h3>North African Front: Sandstorms and Heatwaves, Only Skirmishes and Artillery Exchanges</h3>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Haitong) - The German High Command announced yesterday that the war in North Africa is currently limited to artillery exchanges and reconnaissance activities due to the desert heat and sandstorms. This is due to "Ghibli," which is extremely unfavorable. "Ghibli" usually occurs in July, but this year it occurred in April. The weather improved slightly at the end of last week, so reconnaissance teams began to operate. Outposts had contact with enemy forces, and British troops, protected by tanks, were defeated by our artillery fire. Transportation in North Africa is unimpeded due to the protection of the German and Italian air and naval forces. Conversely, British transportation has been hindered by German and Italian aircraft bombing. The Axis navies have recently sunk enemy vessels in the central and eastern Mediterranean.</p>

<h3>France Establishes Special Bureau to Collect Waste</h3>
<p>Vichy, 26th (Havas) - Due to the impact of the war and the scarcity of raw materials, French manufacturers have had to use substitutes and waste to compensate. France had already produced some substitutes before the outbreak of the war, such as rayon and artificial leather. However, due to the abundance of raw materials at the time, this industry was not very developed. After the signing of the armistice agreement between France and Germany, the government began to encourage people to manufacture substitutes, such as artificial fuel, coal gas, artificial fiber coke, wood gas, and artificial paint. However, the country still felt a shortage of materials. To remedy this situation, the authorities have established a special bureau dedicated to collecting discarded waste nationwide. However, there are still many difficulties in getting people to understand that this is the most economical way to obtain raw materials. Therefore, the work can be divided into the following aspects: establishing waste trading organizations, researching the goods that can be manufactured from waste and classifying them, compiling waste markets, and disseminating the economic concept of waste utilization to the public through propaganda channels. In 1941, a total of 700,000 tons of rags and 138,000 tons of waste paper were collected nationwide and used to manufacture white paper, accounting for 18% of the total paper production. From April to December of last year, a total of 1,550 tons of discarded rubber and 85 tons of hair were collected. Also, from June to December of last year, French factories used 9,500 tons of waste bones.</p>
<h3>Melbourne, Capital of Australia</h3>

Due to the development of the times, Melbourne's position will now be even more important. This picture is of the Manchester Unity Building in Melbourne.</p>
<h3>Full Text of Hitler's Speech</h3>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Haitong) - After General Göring announced the opening of the German Parliament at 3:08 PM yesterday, Führer Hitler delivered the following speech: "Germany was forced to go to war in September 1939. The world is now beginning to understand the truth about the causes of the bloody war. On September 3rd of that year, Britain and France, disregarding Germany's efforts to maintain peace, declared war on Germany, creating today's catastrophe for mankind. To this day, I do not know whether the British government's repeated rejection of my proposals for establishing understanding after 1933 was a wise decision. Bolsheviks have the ambition to redden the world. Therefore, Germans are determined to destroy the Red Army."</p>
<p>Boasting of War Achievements</p>
<p>"After the winter, the German military posture on the Eastern Front has become more stable. Since the Spanish Civil War, the crisis of Bolshevism has alerted European youth. Therefore, the Soviet Union's attempt to profit from this war has now been thwarted by Germany, Italy, and Hungary. The Jewish capitalist democracies are now fighting alongside the Soviet Union, aiming to protect their power to exploit humanity. However, oppressed nations are now united and fighting for freedom and independence to solve the bread and butter issues of the people. The outcome of this war will be decided on the Eastern Front. Germany has repeatedly achieved astonishing victories in this war. Poland, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France have been conquered by our troops. In North Africa, Italian and German troops are fighting side by side. The rebellion in Serbia has also been quelled by our troops. British troops in Greece, after being severely attacked by our troops, collapsed and retreated. The Soviet Union's attempt to threaten the German border has also failed. Enemy ships sunk to date amount to more than sixteen million tons. All this has already shocked the world. Now, the heroic Japan is making victorious progress in East Asia."</p>
<p>Arduous Warfare</p>
<p>"On the Eastern Front, our troops were unable to fight due to the severe cold weather, and had to switch to a defensive posture, taking this opportunity to replenish our strength to await the decisive battle in the spring. In 1812, Napoleon advanced into Moscow but ultimately perished due to the severe cold. The lowest temperature at that time was 25 degrees below freezing. Last winter, the lowest temperature on the Eastern Front was 52 degrees below freezing. From this, we can understand the hardship of the German soldiers on the Eastern Front. Finnish troops are fighting side by side with our troops to defend against the Red Peril and have made outstanding achievements. Their confidence in victory has not wavered and is worthy of our respect. The Spanish Legion is also sharing hardships with our troops on the front lines. Our admiration for them is beyond measure. Other legions, such as those from Hungary, Slovakia, and Croatia, have also endured hardship and fulfilled the great mission of liberating the world. Italian troops have also been able to defend their positions on the Eastern Front and thwart the Soviet offensive. The heroism of the Romanian Legion is also admired by all of us. From this, we can see that we have united with the European nations and are determined to destroy the Soviet Union's threat to redden the world and to seek the safety of mankind together."</p>
<p>Demanding Special Privileges</p>
<p>"European nations are working together to fight a common enemy. German stormtroopers and troops from France, Belgium, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Ukraine are participating in the war against the Bolsheviks. The air forces of Finland and Italy have also severely damaged enemy forces. I use the power given to me by the German people to make important decisions. I and all the soldiers express our gratitude for the support of the people of the whole country. The hardship of the front lines is a lesson for us. I will take all necessary measures to prevent this hardship from happening again. This winter, the German army will have better railways, locomotives, tanks, trailers, and trucks. You should not doubt my determination. I hope that the German people will give me the power to demand absolute obedience from the people in order to complete a greater mission. Both the front lines and the rear must obey the sole principle of striving for victory. At present, no individual can insist on various privileges. Everyone should recognize that there is only responsibility at present. I ask the German Parliament to clearly stipulate that I have the legal power to make anyone fulfill their responsibilities and to punish those who do not fulfill their responsibilities. The exercise of this power only involves a small number of the millions of people. The soldiers on the front lines and the workers in the rear are asking for leave, and I have the right to refuse them because I have not had three days of vacation since 1933. Winter has passed, and the stalemate on the Eastern Front will end. History will determine who is the victor of the winter battles."</p>
<p>Naval and Air Warfare</p>
<p>"Hitler then elaborated on the methods of air warfare and submarine warfare, stating, 'I am not afraid of the generals of Britain and the United States. However, if Britain intends to continue engaging in air warfare and poisoning civilians with new weapons, I must explain my attitude towards air warfare at this time. Churchill himself was the instigator of the air war. He first launched an air raid in May 1940, but at that time, I only gave him a warning and waited for him to come to his senses for four months. In the end, because he was obsessed, I had to take action. As a result, the person who started the air war was greatly panicked. At this moment, I am willing to be patient again to see his future actions. However, this attitude is not a sign of weakness. I must warn this person not to be willful and cause panic again. He has forced me to take retaliatory measures, which only cause great suffering to his people. From now on, I will retaliate until this kind of crime disappears. This work will end at the same time as him. Moreover, I have great faith in the future. The war on the Eastern Front will continue until the Soviet behemoth is destroyed. At the same time, we must continue to fight Britain with submarines. In the autumn of 1939, Churchill gave a speech to the British people, saying that the threat of submarines had been conquered. In fact, I dare to say at this moment that submarines will still force Britain to surrender, no matter what Churchill says. I can guarantee to you that we have a large number of submarines, more than in the last World War. In fact, we have all the conditions needed to win. If we unfortunately fail, our nation will come to an end, and barbarism will prevail in Europe, no different from Europe before the fifteenth century. The German soldiers know this best. Britain will gain nothing in the current war and may even lose everything. In the end, it will be clear that the destiny of the nation-state cannot be entrusted to bureaucrats. Truth will prevail, and truth is on our side. At this greatest moment in our country's history, I am proud to lead the German nation in a common struggle. I am willing to unconditionally link Nai's name and life with the fate of the people. I have no other request to God but to bless our descendants. However, I still hope that God can give me the years to wait for the completion of the struggle of our nation.' (Havas)"</p>
<p>Göring's Speech Encourages the People</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Wahas) - The House of Representatives convened this afternoon. First, Führer Hitler delivered a speech, reiterating his determination to fight the Soviet Union (see previous telegram). Next, Speaker and Minister of Aviation General Göring spoke, asking all Germans to be loyal to the Führer, stating, "Each meeting of this House occupies an important page in the history of the German nation. Whenever the German nation is at the transition between the old and new stages of life, the Führer must convene this House to explain to the people the reasons for taking certain actions. In this session, the Führer has reported to the people on the winter war situation. Winter was a great crisis for the German nation, and the people deeply felt the existence of this crisis, but they still firmly believed in the Führer. The prosperity of the people in the rear can be compared with the heroic spirit of the soldiers on the front lines. The Führer has thanked the soldiers on the Soviet front lines, but I deeply believe that the people will be able to fully recognize who led us through this crisis. There has never been a nation in the world that is so sincerely grateful to its Führer. Those of us who work under his leadership know how much hardship the Führer has endured to save the motherland. We can now publicly declare that the reason why our country can hold the Eastern Front and launch a great offensive is due to the Führer alone. Now that the difficult situation has passed, I may as well mention how great the Führer needed to be in order to solve the new problems that arose every day in the past. The Führer personally planned various measures to increase the number of trains running to the Eastern Front every day and drafted various combat plans to allow our army to calmly deploy and wait for an opportunity to move. In short, the Führer has foresight on everything. Since last winter, our soldiers and civilians have greatly increased their confidence in the Führer. We are now fighting a battle for the survival of the nation. The Führer must obtain all the power necessary for the final victory. He holds the three positions of Führer of the German nation, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy and Air Force, and Head of Government, and can require every soldier and citizen to do their duty to the end. He does not need to accept the restrictions of the court or law and can implement punishment. In short, we must remove all administrative restrictions on him. Members of Parliament, you are representatives of the German nation, and I now ask you to prove by standing up that the Führer has been granted all the rights he has requested by the entire people." At this point, the members of the court stood up to show their approval. Göring then addressed the Führer, saying, "Führer, you have overcome the difficulties of winter, the most difficult season we have experienced. The national army and people respectfully stand before you, ready to continue fighting under your leadership and overcome any obstacles. The army awaits your orders, and the weather has now improved. Our army is eager to be ready and brave to make contributions. Our army, navy, and air force are eager to fight under your wise leadership to achieve a historically unprecedented victory."</p>
<p>Italian Newspaper Observation</p>
<p>Rome, 27th (Haitong) - Roman newspapers published Hitler's speech in a prominent position, believing that Hitler hinted at the possibility of launching an offensive in the near future. Most newspapers discussed the new powers granted to Führer Hitler by the German Parliament. The Roman People's Daily pointed out that Führer Hitler's personal speech in Congress always had a major impact.</p>

<h3>Municipal Council Tries to Increase Number of Rice Shops, No Sign of Changes in Purchase Limits</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council had previously announced that 397 rice shops were permitted to operate in the two concessions. However, recently, 25 rice shops have had their licenses revoked by the Municipal Council for violations or have voluntarily closed down. Therefore, the number of rice shops actually operating is currently 372. Yesterday, the Datong News Agency reporter learned that the Municipal Council is trying to increase the number of rice shops to make it easier for the public and reduce difficulties in purchasing rice.</p>
<p>Receiving Tickets to Transport Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday, rice shops in the two concessions received tickets for corn from the Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Management Committee. After paying the Rice and Grain Office, they can start transporting corn from Laihe Warehouse at 195 Suzhou Road today for sale in the county on Friday. The transportation permits issued by the Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Office last Saturday, designating the transportation of foreign rice from Jardine Matheson Wharf on Yangshupu Road and Swire Warehouse on the French Concession Bund, were not completed on Sunday and will continue to be transported today. The transportation of this batch of rice from the warehouses can be completed today. The situation for transportation on Wednesday (tomorrow) can be trending towards universality.</p>
<p>Restrictions Remain</p>
<p>As for the restrictions on the quantity of rice transported, the Datong News Agency reporter learned that the limit for foreign rice remains at one sheng per person, and the limit for corn remains at one and a half sheng. There are no signs of increasing the quantity, but there is an increase in the number of rice shops. To prevent accidents, the police force has dispatched more patrol officers to maintain order when rice shops transport foreign rice these days.</p>
<h3>Short Weights in Sales Result in Fines</h3>
<p>Selling Unsterilized Milk Results in a Fine of 50 Yuan. The Municipal Council Information Office announced that New New Company was fined 50 yuan for selling short-weight Goose Brand sugar on April 24 as a warning. The European Bakery was fined 40 yuan for under-weight bread as a warning. Pan Ronghe, the licensee of the Huili Heji Dairy Farm, was fined 50 yuan for selling unsterilized milk in violation of Article 23, Paragraph 1 of the Dairy Farm Rules and Clause 3 of its License Rules as a warning to others.</p>
<h3>Second Landlords' Licensing Period: Only Four Days Left; Fewer Than 30,000 Licenses Issued</h3>
<p>As of last Saturday, the Public Works Department had issued over 26,000 licenses for subletting properties. The highest number issued in a single day was on the 24th, reaching 1,892. With only four days remaining until the licensing deadline, second landlords who have not yet obtained their licenses should not take this final opportunity lightly. It is understood that the department will strictly punish second landlords who fail to obtain licenses before the deadline.</p>
<p>Increased Issuance in Recent Days</p>
<p>According to a report by the Datong News Agency, the daily number of licenses issued by the Public Works Department's Tax Division and various district offices in the Northwest and East, in addition to those previously announced, were as follows: On the 23rd, 345 licenses were issued in the Central District, 646 in the Western District, 1,256 in the Northern District, and 394 in the Eastern District, totaling 1,735.

<h3>A Burglar Who Escaped from Prison Five Years Ago Falls Back into the Net</h3>
<p>Wang Agen, a notorious burglar from Hangzhou, aged 54, was arrested by the French Concession Police five years ago for numerous theft offenses and sent to the Special Second Court for trial. Unexpectedly, before the trial began, Wang took advantage of the carelessness of Judicial Police Officer No. 55 and escaped from custody while awaiting trial, disappearing without a trace. The police officer was subsequently dismissed from his post for negligence. It was unexpected that after Wang escaped, he roamed free and resorted to fraud to make a living for five years, until yesterday at 11:30 AM when Wang attempted to extort money from a business at 489 Avenue Joffre. He was reported, arrested, and during interrogation at the police station, it was discovered that the accused was an escaped prisoner.</p>

<p>Yesterday at 4:15 PM, Chen Baogen, a 22-year-old telephone operator at the Great Shanghai Hotel from Peidong, was accidentally shot in the right waist. He was rushed to Renji Hospital for emergency treatment. The incident occurred when a security guard, Song Binggen, placed his gun on a table in the telephone room. Chen's colleague, Xu Binggen, picked it up and was playing with it, mistakenly believing it was not loaded. He accidentally pulled the trigger, causing the gun to discharge and resulting in this unfortunate incident.</p>
<h3>German Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai Hosts Mr. Kawata, President of the Chamber of Commerce; Mr. Gadew, President of the German Chamber of Commerce, Delivers a Speech</h3>

<h3>Methods for Paying Taxes in the French Concession in Legal Tender to End This Month; Prepayment of Donations Also Accepted in Legal Tender</h3>
<p>According to the English-language North China Daily Mail, the French Municipal Council stated yesterday morning that residents of the French Concession who pay land rent in legal tender must pay their first-quarter land tax before this Thursday (the 30th) to avoid economic hardship after switching to paying taxes in Central Reserve Bank notes. There will be no exchange rate discount for first-quarter land tax payments made after April 30th. This discount is a benefit offered by the authorities to residents of the French Concession to avoid economic losses. The method is that when residents pay taxes, they can pay in legal tender at face value, without having to pay a cent more due to the difference between legal tender and Central Reserve Bank notes. However, this discount does not apply to residents who pay land rent in Central Reserve Bank notes. The deadline for this method is the 30th of this month. Those who have not paid their first-quarter land tax by the deadline will not be able to enjoy the discount, and all future land rent payments in legal tender will also have to be paid in Central Reserve Bank notes. The discount will still be available for prepayment of the second-quarter land tax, but only if prepaid before the end of the month.</p>
<h3>Apprentice Dies Suddenly After Milling Rice</h3>
<p>Xu Zhanghu, a 14-year-old apprentice from Ningbo working at the Taixing Palm Mattress Shop at 265 Rue Foch, was instructed by his master, Yang Jinfu, on the afternoon of the 25th to mill rice at the Yongtai Rice Shop at 119 Avenue Haig. At 5:00 PM, on his way back to the shop, he suddenly collapsed in front of number 48 Avenue Haig. A patrolman from number 595 recognized him and took him to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but he died at 11:15 PM that night. The police transported the body to the morgue for examination. Yesterday, his master claimed the body for burial. His master, Yang Jinfu (37 years old, from Pudong), told people that Xu Zhanghu's death should be thoroughly investigated to determine if it was caused by injuries sustained while milling rice, or if he was beaten or harmed by someone, resulting in his tragic death.</p>
<h3>Warehouse Workers Collude with Rice Shop to Steal and Sell Rice Intended for the Police; Chinese Detectives and Staff at the Gordon Road Police Station Have Eleven Batches of Rice Stolen and Sold; Head Detective Discovers the Theft</h3>
<p>Each week, all Chinese detectives and staff at the Gordon Road Police Station are entitled to purchase rice at a discounted price of five yuan and ten cents per person, limited to three liters. They must first obtain a rice ticket from the Western staff member in the office who manages the food supply.</p>
<p>Rice Tickets Required for Collection</p>
<p>Every day from 3:00 PM, workers from the rice warehouse, Zhu Peizhu, Zhu Peiyao, and Cai Mingyao, all from Jiangbei, and the deliverymen from a certain rice shop who deliver this discounted foreign rice every week, Hou Xiangquan and Zhu Chenglin, both locals, are responsible for measuring and distributing the rice to the ticket-holders among the Chinese detectives and staff. However, the workers Zhu Peizhu and others colluded with the rice shop deliverymen Hou Xiangquan and Zhu Chenglin to embezzle and sell the rice for personal gain, escaping punishment. This was essentially a case of those guarding the store stealing from themselves. Recently, Chinese head detectives Cao Zhide and Zhu Yongsheng discovered the theft of the discounted rice. On the 18th of this month, at 3:40 PM, Head Detective Zhu secretly went to the discounted rice warehouse to observe the situation.</p>
<p>Stealing and Reselling</p>
<p>When a person redeems the discount rice ticket, it must be placed on a metal hook for cancellation. However, these individuals secretly pocketed ten rice tickets, hid them in their clothes, and sold them to others, then returned to the rice warehouse to claim more rice. Head Detective Zhu realized that these individuals were using this method to steal rice tickets, sell them to others for profit, and use the money for their own purposes. He immediately detained the workers Zhu Peizhu, Zhu Peiyao, Cai Mingxiang, and the rice shop deliverymen Hou Xiangquan and Zhu Chenglin, along with ten rice tickets. The legal representative of the Legal Department filed a public prosecution against them for embezzlement under Article 336, Paragraph 1, of the Criminal Law and requested joint detention. An investigation later by Head Detectives Zhao Zhide and Zhu revealed that from January to April 18th, this discounted rice had been sold in fifteen batches. Starting from the fifth batch, there had been this secret fraudulent embezzlement of foreign rice. In total, more than thirty dan (a unit of weight) were missing, worth over 6,000 yuan. Yesterday morning, detectives Zhao and Zhu provided evidence, questioned the defendants, who denied responsibility and gave evasive answers. The case is scheduled for sentencing on May 4th.</p>
<h3>A Rice Purchase Dispute Arises During Street Sales</h3>
<p>Yu Shanqing, a local resident living at 34 Baoyu Lane, Dongxin Bridge Street, reported to the French General Patrol Room the other day that he is a rice merchant's runner. Last month, Fei Xianfang from Ningbo (living at 46 Shanquan Lane, Tianj in Road) approached him, claiming to have 100 bags of white rice for sale. Yu Shanqing agreed to purchase 50 bags, with payment upon delivery. However, not long after, Fei's father came to Yu Shanqing, stating that a transportation permit was needed to deliver the rice, which required 1,000 yuan in Japanese military scrip to obtain. Fei then asked Yu Shanqing to meet him at room 312 of the Dazhong Hotel, Zhengjia Wood Bridge, and paid him over 7,200 yuan in old legal tender, equivalent to 1,000 yuan in Japanese military scrip, for which Fei issued a receipt, promising to deliver the rice after obtaining the permit within ten days. However, Fei has since disappeared. Yu Shanqing realized he had been deceived and requested an arrest warrant for interrogation. The head detective approved the report and dispatched detectives to arrest Fei, who confessed that he was involved in another rice purchase dispute and was therefore withholding the funds. He was detained for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Announcement by the Chairman of the British Residents' Association: The Goal of Relieving British Nationals Is to Enable Self-Sufficiency; The British Government Will Only Cover the Deficit in Funds</h3>
<p>The Swiss Consulate General in Shanghai and the British Residents' Association have recently begun processing relief loans for British nationals. The fund is entirely funded by the British government, with a portion coming from donations from various parties in Shanghai. British nationals who are genuinely experiencing difficulties in maintaining their livelihoods due to the impact of the war may apply for loans. The maximum loan amount per month is 750 yuan for single individuals, 1,500 yuan for couples, 2,000 yuan for couples with one child, 2,400 yuan for couples with two children, 2,700 yuan for couples with three children, and an additional 300 yuan for each additional child.</p>
<p>Funds Rely on Donations</p>
<p>This fund is managed and distributed by the Swiss Consulate, which is responsible for representing British interests, and the British Residents' Association. Its main source of income is donations from various parties in Shanghai. Although the British government also provides subsidies, the amount is limited to the amount needed to cover any shortfall after donations have been collected. Therefore, Mr. Kohler, the Chairman of the British Residents' Association, has already issued a notice to all British nationals in the city, calling for donations and stating that the goal is to enable local British nationals to be self-sufficient. Therefore, it is necessary to maximize income and reduce expenditure as much as possible. Mr. Kohler hopes that British nationals will be able to reach their goal through self-discipline, collective effort, and mutual support during this difficult time.</p>
<p>Applications Not Permitted Unless Facing Hardship</p>
<p>The conditions for British nationals to apply for loans are extremely strict. The maximum amounts mentioned above will only be granted in special circumstances. Those applying for loans should consider their actual needs and determine the minimum amount required. The loan conditions stipulated by the British Residents' Association are that "loans shall not be requested unless all other sources of funds have been exhausted. If an applicant's income is insufficient to cover expenses, the amount of the loan shall be limited to an amount that does not cause their total income to exceed the prescribed maximum amount and exceed a normal standard of living." Applicants must also provide a guarantee that the loan will be repaid in the future. Holders of foreign currency accounts or other securities must issue checks or provide other collateral.</p>
<p>Four Measures for Donors</p>
<p>Regarding donations, the British Residents' Association has also established four measures: 1. When a donor makes a payment to the fund, the British Residents' Association will record the amount and convert it to pounds sterling at the current exchange rate. 2. If a donor requires assistance from the fund in the future, they must also meet the usual conditions. Assistance will be paid monthly according to the regulations in force at the time, until their original donation is exhausted. These payments may be made without requiring a guarantee that they must be repaid in the future. 3. Repayment to donors will depend on the condition of the fund at the time and whether the British government can continue to provide funds to the Consulate General in the administering country. 4. If the donor does not require assistance, the donated funds will be used entirely for the relief fund.</p>
<h3>U.S. War Prisoners Relief Committee Delivers Second Batch of Goods; Twelve People Granted Permission to Leave Camp the Other Day</h3>
<p>This morning (the 27th), the Shanghai American War Prisoners Relief Committee delivered a second large batch of goods, fully loaded on a truck, to Lieutenant Matsuda, Assistant Disbursing Officer of the Japanese Army, for distribution to American prisoners of war in Shanghai.</p>
<p>No Shortage of Clothing and Food</p>
<p>These items, ranging from shirts, shoes, and hats to milk and biscuits, were diverse, totaling 1,139 and a half items. The "half" item was due to there being 29 and a half pairs of socks. Food accounted for the largest number of items, including butter, meat, and canned vegetables, everything was complete. Given the current situation, food is the most important thing, and it will undoubtedly provide great satisfaction to the detained American prisoners. Great attention was also paid to clothing, including no fewer than 149 towels, as well as pajamas and pillowcases, among other things. There were also miscellaneous items such as soap, books, and paper, indicating thorough consideration.</p>
<p>May Be Allowed to Leave Camp in Batches for Recreation</p>
<p>According to a report from the Allied News Agency, twelve American prisoners of war were granted permission by the Japanese Army authorities yesterday afternoon (the 26th) to leave the detention camp and go to Hongkou Park for recreation for two and a half hours. This was the first time they were allowed to leave the detention camp, and they were very happy to have this opportunity. A visit to a Japanese hotel was also very enjoyable. Yesterday's prisoner recreation was of a trial nature. If the results are approved by the Japanese Army authorities, they will be allowed to go out on a regular basis. The twelve American prisoners were led by Major Blanc, former commander of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Tianjin, along with four Marine Corps officers, six civilian workers from Wake Island, and one senior crew member from the American merchant ship *Malama*, which was sunk by the Japanese Navy near Tahiti.</p>

<h3>Christian Orphanage Planning Expansion Due to Funding Difficulties; With the Closure of Many Refugee Camps, It Is Difficult to Refuse Orphans Requesting Admission</h3>
<p>The Christian Orphanage on Jiangjia Lane, Columbia Road, has been established for more than two years. It houses displaced orphans and refugee children, aiming to educate outstanding children, cultivate healthy citizens, continue the vitality of the nation, and prevent them from becoming a burden on society. Currently, it houses around fifty orphans, but it is facing difficulties in supplying food and has launched a fundraising campaign.</p>
<p>Past History</p>
<p>The orphanage was originally run by Mrs. Main of the American Church, who rented several acres of land on Columbia Road and built multiple houses, including classrooms, dormitories, medical rooms, and a chapel. In the past, Mr. Yu Qiaqing donated ten bags of Saigon rice, the Red Cross donated rice and wheat, and the Chinese Cotton Mill donated sixteen bolts of cloth and four hundred catties of cotton, which were relied upon to sustain the orphanage. This spring, when the American expatriates withdrew from Shanghai, a board of directors was established by local church members such as Li Baiqiang, Huang Lanyu, and Xu Shaodi to continue operations. Originally, it was intended to house thirty orphans, but referrals from various parties came one after another. Impoverished children housed by the Public Works Department's Child Welfare Section were also taken in by the orphanage.</p>
<p>Current Situation</p>
<p>Currently, the orphanage houses a total of thirty children, including thirty-four boys and sixteen girls, aged between six or seven and fourteen years old. Each child requires around twenty-five yuan per month for various expenses, with the rice problem being particularly serious. The orphanage needs approximately four bags of rice, costing 1,300 yuan, which accounts for a large portion of its expenses, making it feel that feeding is difficult. The orphanage is now planning to build additional classrooms and dormitories on the vacant land in order to accommodate more orphans, as many refugee camps are being closed and it is difficult to refuse children requesting admission. If the rice problem can be solved, the number of places can be expanded.</p>
<p>Appeals for Donations</p>
<p>Therefore, it is sincerely hoped that enthusiastic members of the public will donate to help, gathering sand to build a tower and collecting armpits to make a fur coat, so that the power of collective effort can be achieved and the effect of lifting a heavy weight with many hands can be seen. The orphanage realizes that social and economic conditions are difficult and that fundraising is not easy, but while the public's situation is difficult, the situation of orphans is even more difficult. We hope that you will embrace the spirit of "treat the young of others as you would your own" and give generously to the poor. The orphanage has four methods for receiving donations: remittances through the post office, remittances through the bank, delivery by fundraisers, or sending someone to collect the donation. Donors can choose whichever method is most convenient. The orphanage's contact address is: Mr. Li Baiqiang, 422 Hankou Road, Shanghai, or Mr. Xu Shaoshan, 125 Hankou Road.</p>
<h3>Flour Allotment: Approximately Forty Bags Per Day</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department's Flour Office has recently continued to designate Taikoo Wharf as the source of flour for various flour product merchants. The flour is transported from the Huasheng Wharf warehouse to Taikoo Wharf to facilitate the extraction by flour product merchants nearby. According to a report by the Datong News Agency, an average of 300 households apply for flour allotment each day, with approximately 4,000 bags allotted. The number of registered flour users is over 4,000, with approval cards issued to about half of them. Recently registered users who have been approved by the office will be notified directly by mail. Those who go to the office to inquire will receive no response.</p>
<h3>Arrest of a Rice Swindler</h3>
<p>According to Huaguang News Agency, Fang Bao from Wuxi, aged 30, recently came to Shanghai from his hometown. He recently used the alias Wu Mingde and colluded with Hu Bingjuan to impersonate members of the Shanghai Special City Rice Market Special Investigation Team, selling rice to various households and shops and collecting deposits ranging from one to two hundred yuan. Victims included Mrs. Kong Cao (housewife of Kong Chengji Clothing Store, 66 Kangti Road), Shen Baokang (waiter at the Continental Hotel, 304 Yu Qiaqing Road), Sun A'mei (owner of a hotel at 324 Hubei Road), (owner of a watch shop at 285 Route Min T'i Ni Yin), and Zhao Guangfa (owner of a shoe store at 427 Zhejiang Road). Afterward, they all reported to the French Concession Police. Detective Li Yuyuan and detectives No. 345 and No. 54 learned that Fang had attempted the same scam on the 25th at 8:00 AM at the Yuanhe Rice Store, 47 Route Sainte Marie, and immediately rushed to arrest him for legal action.</p>
<h3>One Night of Passion Leads to Tragedy; Bride Commits Suicide, Groom Faints; Strange Incident Under Police Investigation</h3>
<p>Wang Dequan, a 27-year-old from Hunan, who lives at 271 Sishun Lane, Da Tong Road, has been working at an antique shop on Wuma Road. Last year, he was introduced by the shop owner and became engaged to a young woman surnamed Zhang (21 years old) from Hangzhou. The wedding was officially held the other day at the Chunhua Lou Restaurant, Daxin Street, Fuzhou Road. In order to simplify things, they rented room 302 of the Xinzha Hotel, Xinzha Road, as their bridal chamber. Unexpectedly, after one night, around 7:00 AM yesterday morning, the bride, Zhang, suddenly jumped out of the room window and committed suicide, falling to the ground with severe injuries to her chest, abdomen, and private parts. Wang, who was in bed, was shocked to see the tragedy and fainted immediately. The hotel clerk reported the incident to the police, and an ambulance was called to rush both of them to Baolong Hospital for treatment. However, Ms. Zhang died from her injuries upon arrival at the hospital, while Wang is still receiving treatment. The police are investigating the cause of the suicide, as the case is very strange.</p>
<h3>Illegal Lottery Den Raided</h3>
<p>Yang Jinlong, a local resident, 50 years old, recently set up an illegal lottery den in a squatter house at No. 3, Lane 284, Route Foch, French Concession, inducing people to gamble. This was discovered by the French Concession Police gambling squad. Detectives were dispatched to the address the other day and arrested Yang and a woman gambling in the lottery, Kang Xindi. Lottery documents and gambling money were confiscated and taken to the police station for detention and interrogation.</p>
<h3>Traffic Resumes in Ningbo City; All Restrictions Lifted; Ships Sailing to Ningbo Have Resumed</h3>
<p>According to a report by the Datong News Agency, traffic in Ningbo city and the Jiangbei riverbank area has been somewhat restricted since the 21st of this month, causing passengers traveling to Ningbo by ship to be temporarily taxed in various inns along the Bund in Jiangbei or to stay in refugee camps, resulting in a large number of people. These restrictions were lifted on the morning of the 26th of this month. The Haitong ship, scheduled to leave Shanghai for Ningbo on the 26th of this month, was therefore delayed and has now been rescheduled to leave Shanghai for Ningbo this afternoon, carrying approximately 900 passengers. The East Asia Company's Changshan Maru left Shanghai for Ningbo the other day, carrying 400 passengers. The Shanghai-Ningbo Company's Hualin ship left for Ningbo yesterday, and the Wanji ship is scheduled to leave for Ningbo tomorrow.</p>
<h3>A Small Noodle Shop</h3>
<h3>Sitting from Noon to Dusk</h3>
<h3>Three Fallen Foreign Doctors</h3>
<h3>Eating a Delicious Chinese Noodle Meal</h3>
<p>One day, in a small noodle shop on the edge of Broadway Road, three foreigners sat around a small round table, each with a bowl of noodles in front of them, steaming hot and fragrant. They ate quietly, but with great effort, because the two smooth chopsticks, in their hands, seemed to be holding a thousand pounds of weight, unable to exert their strength, and extremely clumsy. The other customers were all Chinese, such as dockworkers and rickshaw pullers, who used chopsticks with practiced skill, making it easy to pick up even slippery noodles.</p>
<p>Gradually, customers left the shop one after another, returning to the nearby docks to carry goods, and the monotonous "Hang Yo" sound came in waves. The three foreigners finally managed to stuff the noodles into their stomachs, and by the time they had finished their hearty meal, almost all the customers in the shop had left.</p>
<p>He is a Famous Doctor</p>
<p>"This meal was so delicious!" one of the foreigners said, taking a handkerchief from the unspeakable pocket of his coat and gently wiping his thin lips. This man was no longer young, his temples were silver-gray, and he looked to be about fifty years old. However, his hands were neat and well-proportioned, sticking out from the dirty sleeves, which was very incongruous. It turned out that these were the hands of a famous doctor. Dr. Mitchell Ivanovich Yeblonski, who had specialized in medicine at European and American universities, was indeed somewhat famous. After coming to Shanghai, he also practiced medicine, but he didn't know the trick of boasting, so the clinic was deserted and the situation deteriorated, so he abandoned his profession and looked for another way to make a living.</p>
<p>One of the companions at the table was a German named Kurt Schlesinger, short and fat, bald, with thick-rimmed glasses on his nose. He was also a doctor, but he had to change his profession to make a living. The other was a Polish man named Jan Prilinka, over fifty years old, with a head of golden hair and two green eyes. He had a doctorate in medicine, and his specialty was corpse preservation, but he had also abandoned this profession.</p>
<p>Eaten for Four Weeks</p>
<p>"It's strange," Dr. Prilinka said in German, which all three of them understood, "This kind of Chinese noodles seems to be a very beautiful food. I have eaten it for four weeks, and not only am I not tired of it, but I also have an appetite to eat it for the rest of my life."</p>
<p>Slowly Debate New Issues</p>
<p>Dr. Xu, the German, said with a dismissive look, "Although noodles have the function of filling the stomach, they lack the vitamins, calcium, phosphorus, and other important nutrients necessary for the human body." Dr. Xu spoke eloquently, always with the demeanor of a former lecturer.</p>
<p>"Dear partners," the Russian Dr. Ye interrupted, "Let's slowly debate new issues. The lung and stomach neuropathy problem we discussed yesterday has not been resolved yet. I always insist that we should start with nerve therapy."</p>
<p>Wouldn't it Delay Life</p>
<p>The spirits of Dr. Xu and Dr. Pu were lifted, and they dragged their chairs closer to the round table, listening attentively to Dr. Ye's high-level remarks. After he finished speaking, Dr. Xu shrugged his shoulders and mechanically raised his glasses a little.</p>
<p>"Mr. Yeblonski, I have told you countless times, the patient needs to be given local diagnosis and treatment immediately, but you insist on giving general treatment first. This is a huge mistake, wouldn't it delay the patient's life. Forgive me for being frank, your proposal does not conform to scientific rules, it is simply unacceptable."</p>
<p>"I think you are both wrong," Dr. Pu said impatiently, "In my opinion, we should first think about the patient's health. The body is..."</p>
<p>The other two were somewhat angry. Dr. Ye couldn't help but say in a mocking tone: "Look, partner, our friend is mentioning the body again. A corpse preservation expert will never get rid of his true colors. Why listen to him talking to himself?"</p>
<p>Spent an Afternoon</p>
<p>The whole afternoon was spent in this way. The setting sun in the twilight was moving more and more obliquely, and the street lights were also shining. The three foreign doctors were still sitting around, with some prescriptions and chemical equations on the table, earnestly discussing treatment methods, as if there was a patient lying next to the table, waiting for them to decide their fate.</p>
<p>The dockworkers had finished their day's work and were rushing to dinner. The noodle shop owner had to order them to leave. The three doctors were still enthusiastically discussing, until the owner roared loudly, interrupting the discussion. Dr. Ye stood up, stretched, and said, "God knows, I forgot to peddle shoelaces."</p>
<p>Dr. Xu seemed to understand something, and said, "I also forgot to do business. You know, I sell exquisite clothing."</p>
<p>Dr. Pu laughed, "You are both knowledgeable doctors, but you sell shoelaces and clothing. I can still rely on my old skills to make money. The other day, a Wang A'san died of his old mother, and I went to take care of the body. Afterwards, he gave me five yuan as a reward. It's getting late today, goodbye."</p>
<h3>Sedan-Style Rubber-Wheeled Carriage</h3>
<p>This kind of sedan-style carriage, at first glance, looks like an ordinary car, but the water tank and engine at the front of the car have been cut off. How can a car without a motor run on the road? In fact, it's very simple. In the picture, the horse is raising its front hooves and moving forward, isn't it a veritable "motor"? Look at the rubber wheels, with enough air pressure, rolling on the asphalt road with a cement base, pulled by a handsome white horse, moving forward slowly and steadily. It's really comfortable. If the roof of this kind of carriage can be moved at will like a car, then in the warm and sunny morning, remove the roof panel, put down the car window, and drive a few laps on the wide avenue, such as Jing'an Temple Road and Xiafei Road, wouldn't it be very pleasant and "enjoyable"?</p>
<h3>A Merchant Shop on Sijing Road</h3>
<h3>Robbed of Huge Sums</h3>
<h3>Silver Box Opened and More Than 60,000 Yuan Robbed</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 8:45, three robbers suddenly came to a merchant shop on Sijing Road in the Public Concession. All of them were holding pistols. After entering, they monitored an apprentice and used a hammer to open the silver box. They were robbed of 8,640 Japanese military notes (approximately more than 60,000 yuan) and 6,000 yuan in legal tender. They took the loot and rushed out of the door and escaped without a trace.</p>

<h3>Li Weining's Regular Concert</h3>
<p>A regular concert organized by musician Li Weining at the Baxianqiao YMCA will be held at 5:15 PM on Saturday. The purpose is to promote the most noble music. The hired performers are all first-class musicians in Shanghai. It is said that although Mr. Li knew that the previous program was too heavy, it was still able to win the support of the audience. Although the expenses of this kind of concert are too high, even if it is "full of seats", it is inevitable to lose money. However, Mr. Li still has the spirit of perseverance and resolutely continues. Since the war, the music scene in this city has been very silent. However, after Mr. Li raised his arms and called, the music scene was able to echo back. It is true that "every plant and tree is a soldier" and music can be found everywhere.</p>
<p>It is said that this issue's program is a violin recital by the famous Shanghai musician Adodong. The selection of the entire program has taken great pains. All of them are extremely difficult and famous violin pieces. There is also a sonata by Mozart, which is dominated by the piano and accompanied by the violin. The entire piano will be played or accompanied by Mr. Li himself. It is said that these two music masters have always been close friends. Recently, the two have even doubled their practice together. The result of their cooperation should not be compared with ordinary random combinations without much cultivation.</p>
<p>It is said that after the program list this time, there is a concise explanation compiled by Mr. Li himself, which should be welcomed by the general public. Tickets are now on sale at the Lanxin Grand Theater, Mou Deli Qin Hang, and the YMCA. People who love noble music should not miss this opportunity.</p>

<h3>Where Did the Small Denomination Notes Go After All?</h3>
<p>Small denomination notes have become increasingly scarce today. The most puzzling thing is what is the way out for rice shops that now have a large number of small denomination notes. Why do they only see them coming in and refuse to find them? Moreover, the rice shops are doing everything possible to be opportunistic. For 2.90 yuan per liter of rice, they pay 5 yuan and refuse to find 1 yuan notes. If they pay 3 yuan, they refuse to find 10 cent notes. They are taking advantage everywhere. It can be said that they are worthy of the name, drilling into every seam. Some people say that rice shops collect as many 1 yuan notes as possible and sell them to small money shops. The small money shops then hoard and speculate, with the highest 5 yuan note increasing by 10 yuan, or at least 7-8 yuan. If you buy 2 yuan of cigarettes at a cigarette and paper shop and want to find 2 yuan, it is not good business. They also have a good reason. They can't earn 20 cents from a box of 2 yuan cigarettes. However, if they find 3 yuan small denomination notes, they will lose 30 cents. Many stores have now stated that they will not give change unless you buy 3 yuan (or 2 yuan). When you go to a barber shop, a haircut is 3 yuan. If you pay 5 yuan, they will say thank you and don't expect any change. In addition, there are many statements that if you don't have 1 yuan notes and pay with 5 yuan notes, they will not give change. It is even more difficult to get change on the tram. The ticket sellers keep stuffing the small denomination notes in their pockets. If you want to find 5 yuan, they will not respond as they used to. They will all say that they don't have small denomination notes. The fewer small denomination notes, the more rare they become, and the more they are collected, the less they circulate on the market. In the past, when this kind of situation occurred, there was still relief. But now, a 1 yuan note is only worth a few cents in the past. If you want to print a 1 yuan note, not only is there no way to print it, but the cost is also different from the past. Who would be willing to print it? Who would provide relief? Moreover, 1 yuan notes are the easiest to damage. There is no new supply and many are broken, and broken ones are refused. This is why the number of small denomination notes is decreasing day by day, and there is no way to crack down on hoarding. What can be done about it?</p>
<h3>Gold Shops Sell Off</h3>
<h3>Spot Gold Falls Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash spot gold black market fluctuated greatly, and the trend continued to decline, falling below 21,000 yuan, all because of the sell-off by various cash gold shops. The trading was quite active. In the morning, each bar (10 taels) initially traded at 20,800 yuan, which was 100 yuan lower. Then it was 20,850 yuan. Suddenly, three cash gold shops came to compete for selling, and it fell by 400 yuan to 20,450 yuan. Securities firms and laymen stepped in, and silver shops also absorbed a little, rising to 20,600 yuan. The gold shops continued to sell, and it fell again to 20,400 yuan. The noon price rebounded slightly to 20,500 yuan, which was 500 yuan lower than the price on Saturday, and has fallen for three consecutive days for a total of 1,650 yuan.

<h3>Public Debt Spot Goods Are Less and Less Traded</h3>
<h3>Whether to Draw a Line in the Middle - It's Still Not Certain at This Time</h3>
<p>The public debt black market traded poorly yesterday. Originally, there were no spot goods flowing out. However, whether to draw a line in the middle and give up competition is still uncertain at this time. If they can withdraw from the war zone, then the future will still tend to rise, because the powerful factions are said to be waiting for an opportunity to move. Yesterday, the market was quite narrow, and there were no major opponents. Yesterday, Baolong continued to increase its holdings by about 200,000 yuan. It is said that the Dabei gang bought it. The rest received less. Zhihe, Tongshun, Dazhong, Shuntai, Yichang, Jiufu, Tongli, Lianyi, and Shunli, etc., although they were all buying, only bought 570,000 yuan each. The buyers Hongxing was more than 100,000 yuan, and Xie Kang and Tong Kang were about 100,000 yuan each. The rest of Yongkang, Hu Hejiang, Zhenhua, Xinhua, Jiufeng, Hongda, Xinyuan, Xinfeng, Qianyi, etc., although they sold out, only sold 350,000 yuan each. The opening price of Class C was too high, and then it dropped back quickly. After entering, it was pulled up again. Class A was seen at 70 yuan again, and Class B was sold off by Qianyi at the close, so the result was neither glory nor disgrace. The rest rose by 3 to 5 cents each. The transaction was about 670,000 yuan. Here is a brief table: Category Maximum Minimum Closing Compared to the previous day Total A 7.00 69.20 69.90 Up 0.90 Total B 63.00 62.00 61.60 Flat Total C 62.60 61.40 61.10 Up 0.30 Total D 57.20 56.4 17.20 Up 0.60 Total E 59.05 58.60 59.00 Up 0.50</p>

<h3>Cigarette Prices Plunge</h3>
<p>The decline in cigarette prices is unstoppable, and the prices of all brands have returned to the original prices in mid-January. The intensity of the change is rarely seen in recent times. At present, because actual sales are difficult to enter a good state, the factory's supply is relatively smooth, speculative activity has decreased, and hoarding households are being forced to prevent mold and flood season, and are eager to sell. In general, they are reluctantly cutting off their losses, so the price is plummeting. It is estimated that Great Britain brand is 9,000 yuan, Old Knife brand is 7,700 yuan, Pinhai brand is 5,800 yuan, Little Fairy brand is 5,200 yuan, Wuhua brand is 5,100 yuan, Japanese cigarette Golden Gun brand is 1,950 yuan, Golden Building is 2,200 yuan, Red Rose is 1,850 yuan, Quanlu brand is 2,400 yuan, National cigarette Golden Mouse brand is 2,950 yuan, Beautiful brand is 4,700 yuan, all of which are 2300 yuan lower than the weekend.

<h3>Diaoding's Source is Obstructed Again</h3>
<p>The first batch of more than 150 pieces of Diaoding has arrived. Due to the regulation relationship, the owner's procedures are not in compliance. Therefore, although they have arrived in Shanghai for more than ten days, they have not yet been reported to the warehouse. It is also said that they have been detained. Therefore, the numbers have sent telegrams to temporarily stop the source. However, the national sugar supply in Shanghai has been cut off. Those who are engaged in this business should try to dredge it so as not to interrupt it, so that the supply and demand can be balanced, and they should be needed.</p>
<h3>Xiangchun Buds Fall by 100 Yuan</h3>
<p>The opening price of the first batch of Xiangchun buds was too high. Although they are seasonal delicacies, the sales are still relatively sluggish. Therefore, the continued arrival of goods has been reduced by 100 yuan, and it has not yet opened up. The later market is still preventing further loosening.</p>

<h3>Shared Sentiment</h3>
<p>— Wei Cheng</p>
<p>It is already difficult enough to mill rice, but to try and earn a tiny profit from “one sheng” milled on the black market is even harder. Some say it is because of these "rice milling gangs" that those who genuinely need to mill rice have no way to "get in," which is indeed the case. However, who isn't truly in need of milling rice? The "rice milling gangs" endure physical pain, going back and forth repeatedly, their stomachs perhaps already so empty they're about to vomit clear water.</p>
<p>Reserve notes of five yuan are not accepted as change. Legal tender, however, must be in single-yuan notes. Even two people from "affiliated businesses" together don't want five-yuan notes. I wonder, when rice shops get rice from the warehouses, do they bring thousands of single-yuan notes? But now is not the time to reason; the moment you reason, you are already out of the long queue. Milling one sheng of rice, how could it be easy?</p>
<p>In the past, there were stories of "accidental gunfire." Now, there have been tragedies of "collapsing and dying of exhaustion." All for the sake of eating. Alas, how tragic!</p>
<p>"Hong Kong to Resume Horse Racing," seen in telegrams, has sparked much discussion. The matters before our eyes, however, are all too commonplace. If we were to switch places, I think we would all share the same sentiment!</p>
<h3>Speculation</h3>
<p>— Er Dong</p>
<p>Notes from the Thatched Cottage of Close Observations quotes Li Yunju, saying: "There was a man who was the richest in the village, hoarding over a thousand dan of grain. When famine struck, he refused to open his stores. Suddenly one day, he quietly gathered his servants, arranged measuring tools, and wrote a red notice, posting it on his door, saying: 'In this year of famine and hunger, how can I bear to be the only one full? I now plan to lend all my accumulated grain to my neighbors; each person will receive one dan as the standard. Come immediately with your sacks to collect it, or the grain will be gone.' Nearby residents, hearing this, gathered like clouds. In less than a day, the grain was gone. Some who wished to see the master to thank him found that the master was nowhere to be found. In great haste, they searched and found him fast asleep in his old, dilapidated house. When people arrived, he yawned and stretched. Beside him, they found a piece of paper saying: 'Hoarding without distributing is a wellspring of resentment; where resentment gathers, disaster follows. With thousands starving and one family full, robbery becomes inevitable. Is it better to perish without a good name? Feeling gratitude for your past virtues, I am acting virtuously on your behalf. I hope you will forgive my presumptuousness; this is what I deeply fear! He recalled nothing of what he had said or done. Inquiring about the beginning and end, he merely sighed. But the people were indeed restless, with plans to burn and loot; this charitable act turned disaster into fortune. Was this a shapeshifting demon (a fox)? It can be said that it loved people with virtue…"</p>
<p>After reading this, I was reminded of Feng Xuan, who once purchased righteousness for Lord Mengchang.</p>
<p>Feng Xuan's "purchasing righteousness" can be seen in historical records; the fox spirit's "acting virtuously" can only be seen as a fable. However, finding such a lovable person as Feng Xuan today would be like wearing out iron shoes without success. Perhaps there was a kind of "ancient virtue that could be followed" in ancient times, but today, people's hearts are not as ancient. Whether this is true or not, I dare not say for sure.</p>
<p>Some say that religions like heaven are created by people who, suffering in reality, dream of seeking spiritual comfort and a place to entrust their souls. If this is to be believed, then theology may become particularly prevalent in the near future.</p>
<p>This is, of course, a speculation, but there are reasons to support it.</p>
<p>In a year of famine and hunger, those who are full not only "hoard without distributing" but also hoard and speculate excessively. Since those who purchase righteousness have disappeared, people have no choice but to retreat and hope that there can truly be a "shapeshifting demon" in the world that "acts virtuously on behalf of others."</p>
<p>Although I dare not predict, the above speculation is very likely to become a reality.</p>
<h3>Waiting</h3>
<p>— Xing Yun</p>
<p>It is said that Zhang Liang used to meet with the Old Man of Yellow Rock. The first time, Zhang Liang went at dawn, but the old man was already there. The second time, he went at the crowing of the rooster, but the old man was still there first. The third time, he went before midnight, and only then did he arrive before the old man.</p>
<p>Now, to "mill rice," going at dawn will certainly leave you empty-handed; going at the crowing of the rooster might not get you anything either. So, you have to go to wait next to the rice shop in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>However, what Zhang Liang waited for was the "Grand Duke's Art of War" to "pacify the world," while what we wait for is merely one sheng of rice, which is not even enough to stave off hunger.</p>
<h3>Where are the Three "Fundamentals"?</h3>
<p>— Fang Sheng'er</p>
<p>In the past, an industrialist had a famous saying: "A businessman must have three fundamentals: first, fundamental conscience; second, fundamental capital; third, fundamental ability." This was then called the "Three Fundamentals Doctrine."</p>
<p>Fundamental conscience is a good conscience, "commercial ethics." Fundamental capital is capital, "commercial capital." Fundamental ability is capability, "commercial knowledge" plus experience, a rather abstract but indispensable force for engaging in commerce.</p>
<p>But look at today's "businessmen." They are well-versed in the way of hoarding. They used to hoard rice, now they hoard medicine. Where is the fundamental conscience? As for selling short and buying long, where is the fundamental capital? As for ability, they neither "manage" anything nor need to "plan" anything; they simply "tumble" on the telephone dial and "solicit" and "sell" while pacing back and forth. Where is the ability? Yet, this is also doing business. Alas!</p>
<h3>Wise Words</h3>
<p>— Nan Ding</p>
<p>Since people know to cherish life, do not waste time. Time is the raw material for creating life.</p>
<p>(Benjamin Franklin)</p>
<p>Without freedom, the nation cannot exist; without virtue, freedom cannot exist.</p>
<p>(Jean-Jacques Rousseau)</p>
<p>Do not neglect small things, and then you can accomplish great things.</p>
<p>(Napoleon I)</p>
<p>I never dared to relax my doubts, but studied them repeatedly until I understood them. (John Stuart Mill)</p>
<h3>Record of Unemployment</h3>
<p>— Gong Ji</p>
<p>Unemployed.</p>
<p>The first satisfying thing about being unemployed is the freedom to sleep as one pleases. In the past, because I had to rush to the office at a set time every day, I was always somewhat sleepy. Drowsing in the office was, of course, not allowed, but yawning incessantly seemed to be in poor taste. Now, all is well. I don't need an alarm clock or someone to wake me up. I can stay under the warm covers as long as I please, sleeping until the sun is high in the sky.</p>
<p>Opening my eyes, the first thing I see is my three-year-old son, Xiaobaxi, between my wife and me, staring blankly at the ceiling with wide eyes.</p>
<p>"Call me Papa."</p>
<p>"No!" Xiaobaxi has a stubborn spirit.</p>
<p>"If you don't call me Papa, I won't buy you candy."</p>
<p>"Papa."</p>
<p>I laughed. My wife was also awakened by the laughter. But thinking of the father-son relationship as nothing more than an economic issue, I felt somewhat melancholic.</p>
<p>After finishing the three-part routine of getting up, gargling, washing my face, and eating a snack, I first pick up the day's newspaper to browse through it. Although unemployed, I still subscribe to the newspaper. It is said that the newspaper is the food of culture. If I am not dead for a day, then it is necessary to continue enjoying this cultural food for a day. I read the political news first. Not because I am deliberately pretending to care about national affairs, but because national affairs do need to be cared about. Next, I read the economic news because, although unemployed, I still have some commercial dealings. Besides, I occasionally go to so-called markets. After reading the news, I read the advertisements. I have always paid attention to small advertisements, especially the "seeking marriage" or "seeking friends" ads in the recruitment section. Not because I want to apply, but because there is often "remarkable writing" to appreciate. Now, I am dizzy from the "seeking" and "selling."</p>
<h3>Sharing the Boat in the Storm</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(4) In the Lingering Light</p>
<p>Guofang tried hard to accommodate what Weicheng said about not having picked up any bad habits, lowering the tone of her words. Smiling, she said, "I only have an older brother, not an older sister, so let's just consider Sister Cuizhen as my older sister." Cuizhen said, "Brother Cheng, look at Miss Chen, she's praising me to this extent. What should I say?" Weicheng said, "Guofang is also a straightforward person. She rarely flatters people casually. It's just that I've suffered a great loss; otherwise, during the New Year, when Guoqi and Guofang came together, how happy we would have been! Now, my mind is so confused that I don't know what I'm saying. Having Guofang here makes me feel a little better." Hearing his voice falter, Cuizhen stood up again and said, "You sit. I'm used to working; I can't just sit here properly. I hear a voice that sounds like Great Aunt is here." Weicheng said, "Oh, they've come to discuss the funeral arrangements." Cuizhen left, and he also went out to see Great Aunt. Not only Great Aunt came, but Li Xieshe also came. They were discussing how to handle the funeral. Guofang began to feel uneasy.</p>
<p>They were close relatives of the Ye family, discussing necessary matters. After finishing the discussion, they all left. Weicheng came to tell Guofang, "The date for my mother's funeral has been set for the second day of the second lunar month. Now, we need to rush to print the obituary. Let me find the obituary from when my father passed away and the obituaries sent by relatives and friends to use as references. There should also be a memorial preface at the end. Can you help me with it?" Guofang quickly shook her head, saying, "I can't do this. This is formal writing. Although we have formal writing class every two weeks at school, where the teacher writes on the blackboard and tells us to copy it down, who wants to copy it? Especially the bereavement notice, obituary, memorial preface, and the wording for sending condolences. None of the students wanted to copy them. One student, who is from Suzhou, said fiercely that whoever copied them was preparing to use them when their own parents died. So, no one paid attention. Asking me is like asking a blind person. I only know that when both parents die, you call yourself an orphan and bereaved child; when the father dies, you call yourself an orphan son; when the mother dies, you call yourself a bereaved son. But things like 'weeping blood' or 'kowtowing' are not clear to me. If you want to ask me, wedding etiquette is something I have some idea about because I have been a bridesmaid twice, and once I was chosen as the female guest representative to deliver a congratulatory speech. At weddings, if you bow incorrectly, everyone just laughs. Getting it wrong here would be a disaster." (61)</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Lack of Small Denomination Notes</h3>
<p>— Pan Shan</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a shortage of small denomination notes on the market again. Asking friends at the bank, they all replied, "We don't even have enough for our own use." Asking at the small money shops on Sichuan Road, the premium has risen to as high as ten yuan for every hundred. The currency of the same bank is being discounted by ten percent. It is truly unbelievable.</p>
<p>Stepping into a small noodle shop to order a bowl of plain noodles, the waiter will ask you if you have small denomination notes. If you answer no, he will impolitely ask you to leave. The reason is—I don't take five-yuan notes.</p>
<p>So, where have all the small denomination notes gone?</p>
<p>There is no doubt that some people are hoarding them, but small denomination notes are not silver or nickel coins, with their own intrinsic value that can be melted down for other uses. The fact that they are being hoarded for profit must have other reasons.</p>
<p>Having finished reading the newspaper, it is time for lunch. Since becoming unemployed, I have long practiced a one-dish-one-soup principle. Occasionally, I buy half a catty of meat to eat. However, the vegetable vendor often recognizes my wife as a new face, and the weight is especially skimped. Whether braised in soy sauce or boiled plain, it looks pitiful in the bowl. But my appetite does not decrease because there is less food and rice is expensive. It takes three bowls to satisfy me. It is said that "in a year of famine, the belly grows large." Judging from this, there is evidence.</p>
<p>The time after lunch is the hardest to endure. Going to the cinema or theatre occasionally is permissible. But if I were to go every day, turning into a professional theatre-goer, it would violate the economic principles of unemployment. Staying at home, I don't play mahjong without one short player, and the novels and magazines are either already read or too cliché. After much consideration, I have no choice but to get up and wander the streets. The road is as smooth as a whetstone, as straight as an arrow. There is no need to pay road tolls, and I can also look at fashionable girls. Why not? Appreciating the Misses' eyebrows, shaved clean and drawn with charcoal pencils, some are like the crescent moon of the third night, others are drawn as a straight line. I often wonder if the Misses are trying to prove on their faces the geometric principle that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. Their cheeks are painted red. Those who have applied it evenly are fine, but some have two distinctly red cheekbones, giving the impression of prominent peaks. Besides people, there are also many things to see. Look at the cakes in the window; even after having eaten a full meal, I want to have one. Looking at the furniture in the furniture store, I can't bear to leave after one glance. Standing in front of the music store, listening to the records being played, I can pretend to have musical talent. When my legs are tired from walking, I can stand in the lobby of the cinema. Fortunately, my clothes are not too tattered. The cinema boy thinks that I have bought a ticket and am waiting for a friend to arrive. Moreover, the movie photos on the walls can dispel my loneliness. When I am satisfied, I return home and lean back on the worn-out sofa, waiting for dinner.</p>
<p>After eating dinner, I go to bed early. Tomorrow morning, I will while away this unemployed time again.</p>
<p>We might as well stand in the position of the hoarders to explore the reasons. The conclusion may be their motive. Due to the impact of the war, the reserves of daily necessities in Shanghai are decreasing day by day. For the welfare of the citizens, the Municipal Council began to set price limits and purchase limits for rice, oil, flour, corn flour, etc. As a result, the need for small denomination notes increased sharply, because the long lines of people waiting in front of the rice shops had to hold small denomination notes in their hands. Thus, clever people began to use their brains, feeling that there was profit to be made. They secretly started buying them up. Small money shops responded to the news, unwilling to be left behind. As a result, the small denomination notes received by various retail stores were unwilling to come out. Even various snack stalls posted notes saying, "Change will only be given for amounts above two yuan." In addition, tram ticket sellers took advantage of the situation. As a result, small denomination notes became a commodity, with a market value like US dollars and military notes.</p>
<p>"He who first made burial figures had no posterity." But this curse is useless. The only way is to increase the issuance of small denomination notes, so that hoarders have no way to use their skills.</p>
<p>It must be known—unclogging the source is the fatal weakness of all hoarders.</p>
<h3>A Small Analogy</h3>
<p>— Lin Daiqiu</p>
<p>Conscience is a mirror, sin is dust, and self-renewal is the cloth for wiping the mirror.</p>
<p>The human body is as precious as life, the shadow is like truth, and sunlight is like struggle.</p>
<p>Will is like a jockey, determination is like a rein, strength is like a horse, and behavior is like running.</p>
<p>Hesitation is like fog, determination and action are like sunlight.</p>
<p>Love is like a tree, passion is the branches and leaves, and understanding is the roots.</p>
