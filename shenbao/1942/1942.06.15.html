<p>原來在第一次世界大戰以前，猶太人，早已有了一種回復故土的運動，叫做邭山主義（Zlouism），此主義發動於十六世紀，及十九世紀而益盛，當時以赫斯和卡力希爾兩人為領導的中心，及一八九四年，法國發一生反對猶太人的杜來夫斯，大案，有一個猶太人赫士爾一博士者，乃益起而努力於邭山主義，而猶太人也開始自動，漸漸向巴勒斯坦移住。</p>
<p>在第一次世界大戰進行中，英國人頗想運用英藉猶太人的資金，就隨時與猶太人拉弄。起始時應允猶太入移住於非洲的烏干達，讓猶太人有一個民族的家庭。猶太人有點不大願意。後來英國對於製造炸藥的必須品酒精日漸缺乏，有一個猶太學者韋士曼博士，硏究結果，竟能從木材中取得酒精。英國的酒精問題，得告解決。這一個發明，使英國人非常感激。當時英國的首相勞合喬治說，韋士曼的天才，實救度了英國。於是英國政府為報答厚恩起見，請問韋士曼要些什麼東西，以為酬報。而韋士曼的答話，則說要英國幫助猶太人在巴勒斯坦建立民族的家鄉，上邊所述的見爾福宜言，就是這樣發生的。</p>
<p>英國於接受巴勒斯坦委任統治權之際，不曾發表過一個很好聽的宣言說，要替猶太人建設一個民族的家庭，也要替阿刺伯人保持一個民族的家庭，要訓練巴勒斯坦的居民漸漸習於自治的藝術，我們即使承認英國政治家的理想是誠實懇摯的，事實上巴勒斯坦地方阿猶兩民族，也決難調和。猶太人吝嗇而勤奮，阿刺伯人慷慨懶惰。阿刺伯人恨猶太人來剝削他們，而猶太人則看不起阿刺伯人。</p>
<p>於是自一九二〇年，英國接受巴勒斯坦委任統治以來，一連串楚阿猶衝突的事件，同時英國本身不是受猶太人的怨恨，就是受阿刺伯人的憤恨，一九二四年山繆爾做最高委員時，因袒護猶太人引起阿刺伯人的攻擊。一九二九年，又因猶太人經濟擴展的刺激，借着耶路撒冷的泣牆事件，阿拉伯人大起反對猶太人。英國人看到阿剌伯人氣勢盛大，又只好敷衍阿刺伯人。於是叉有殖民大臣柏斯非爾的白皮書報吿，說要限制猶太人的入遷。這一來，猶太人又不滿意了。</p>
<p>這以後，阿猶兩族一直不能調和。在一九三〇年及一九三三年這幾個年頭中，阿刺伯人的反猶運動，往往轉變而成為反英運動。這樣一直到第二次世界大戰的前夜，英國曾提出一個分劃巴勒斯坦的計劃，將巴勒斯坦分為一部分的政治區域。北部劃歸猶太人，南部劃歸阿刺伯人，而以耶路撒冷附近劃為委任統治的區域。這個計劃沒有實行，而第二次大戰爆發，英國只好以鐵腕統治巴勒斯坦，把阿猶兩族一起鎭壓下去。近三年中，巴勒斯坦方面沒有什麽消息流出來，就是這個道理。</p>
<p>說到那些移回巴勒斯坦的猶太人，他的確能幹。他們在這裹，投下了大批的資本，從事於農業，他們流浪得着實太長久了，很想就此宣傳下來，眞的要把巴勒斯坦做到摩西所說的『乳和密』的世界。他們開發死海中的鉀素，並利用約組河的水力發電。在沿海一帶，近約法地方，他們建設了一但新的城市，住下了五萬個猶太人。他們名此城曰希望之山（Telaviu</p>
<p>猶太人的心思財力，一天天在那里發展，這就大有排斥阿刺伯人的可能。阿刺伯人從中心恨着猶太人。他們說巴勒斯坦是他們的巴勒斯坦的大多數人民是他們。　他們對於猶太人是六對一之比。他們又不滿於英國的統治，他們說在土耳其帝國時代，他們只對蘇丹供獻十八萬鎊，即對英國則須供獻五十萬了。所以阿刺伯人從猶阿而轉變為反英。當。一九三三年，英國自伊拉克到海發的油管完成的時候，阿刺伯人大起暴動，英國用了甚大的壓力，遂能鎭壓下去。</p>
<p>連帶講講外約但</p>
<p>新月地帶可組政治地區——伊拉克叙里亞巴勒斯坦外約但——都是阿刺伯人的家鄕。這四個地區中的阿刺伯人在英法眼中看來，巴勒斯坦和叙里亞最不安分，伊拉克是舉動漂亮而外約但最為馴順。英國在這里安置一個外約但也的確是得意之筆。外約但的地位，正在伊拉克巴勒斯與沙特阿拉伯之間。它可以做阿刺伯人連絡的中一心，它也可作阿刺伯人團結連絡的障碍。因為外約但國王非常馴順，它便障碍了阿刺伯人的連絡團結。當巴勒斯坦與阿刺伯人起而向猶反英的時候，他們不能希望沙漠地方同族的幫助。英國布置巴勒斯坦統治地的時候，就另劃外約但為一個委任統治區域以原來麥加行政長官胡賓國的第二個個兒子阿勃，杜拉為國王。英國以種種近代的享樂，來籠絡這位低能的國王。——送他飛機，送他汽車。——在外約但，英國沒有引猶太人去住，可是英國的顧問，却做了阿勃杜拉的　　。</p>
<p>外約相百底比里亞河及約但河死海一綫向東伸展，而積為千方英里，人口二十四萬，全境大部分是沙漠，首都日阿曼，有公路　耶路撒冷英國在電里駐有空軍。</p>

<p>— 楊子江</p>
<p>最近只要是稍留心閱報的人，就都知道有許多新創設的華商保險公司相機成立，反映出保險事業形成了特殊的發達和繁榮，這許多如雨後春筍般的新保險公司正是這個時代的寵兒！</p>
<p>保險事業在中國，以往是以英美商的保險公司勢力為最大，而且都具有根深蒂固的悠久的歷史。像歐美商的美亞·北美·舊金山……英商的四海。巴勒……非但資金雄厚，而且規模亦大，勢力亦廣。</p>
<p>但是自從去年十二月八日太平洋戰事發生後，英美等商的保險公司及代理商行六十餘家都受影響停止營業，至今年一月二十六日，日方叉宜佈將其中主要的二十三家（內經營水火險二十家，人壽險三家），派遣監督官辦理淸理，這一個轉捩，給予華商保險業一個莫大的興盛的機會，這一次演變，才形成了目前新興保險業蓬勃的氣象·</p>
<p>據調査所得，最近新創立已經加入火險同業業務協會的共有泰安·大安·大南·大業·豐·大東等多家。已經申請入會的有華泰·新豐·國華·大新等數家，正在籌備中的有利民·大中華·中國工業等數家，資本數額都自十萬至一千萬元不等。總計連原有華商保險公司，已述四十餘家，這不僅象徵華商保險業的特殊發達，同時也打破了華商保險事業有史以來的紀錄。</p>
<p>目前新興保險公司的組織，多是以獲得營業上利益為目的之股份公司，一般營利組織之資格，各國所採之法制互異，如法國對人籌保險必須為股份或兩合公司。德國對人壽傷害，風電等保險公司，必須為股份組織，其餘則否。日木僅限於股份有限公司，英國則極對不予限制。股份組織和相互組織互具優劣，主耍則視所處塲合而決定。其促成則以現實社會情形與需求為依歸，在目前這許多新設的股份公司，當然也是由時代背景所產生的。</p>
<p>現在保險業發展的趨勢，最發逮的要推財產保險。</p>
<p>財產保險就是以財產减失損害為訂立保險契約之要件者，最近各種業務的情形變化亦多：</p>
<p>海上保險亦簡稱水險，以担保對於保險標的物，因海上一切事變變化所遭受之損害及費用為目的之保險契約，其屬於船舶者為船舶保險，屬於貨物之貨物保險，及屬於運費之遝費保險，和屬於利益之利益保險，戰前本埠與歐美，南洋及沿海，長江各航綫，輪船往返頻繁，水險亦呈異常發達。迨八一三後，沿海及長江航運首遭打擊，繼又因歐洲大戰爆發，滬歐航輪深受影饗，嗣後又因戰火波及遠東，滬美·滬港及甫洋航輪亦陷停頓，致水險業務迭經打擊，已陷於一蹶不振狀態。目前進出輪隻尙不逮戰前之一二，且海面不靖，戰氣瀰漫，海航安全已失保障，故保險商亦多不敢問津，業務淸淡可見一班。</p>
<p>火災保險簡稱火險，即以賠償標的物因火災所受之損害為目的之保險，又可分為動產（如貨物，機器，生財裝修，衣服行李等）及房屋（包括各種建築物）兩種。滬巿自形成孤島後，人口繁增，發展畸形，而囤積貨物為數尤鉅（統計約二十萬萬元左右）所以火險乃隨之趨而發達，成為目前各保險公司業務的主要目標所在。</p>
<p>其他如運輸保險汽車保險失竊保險汽鍋保險玻璃保險電梯保險等。其中，曾流行一時為汽車保險，因目前汽油已受嚴厲限制，汽車驟减，影響所及，也巳一落千丈。</p>
<p>至於人體保險及無形利益保險，則比較財產保險的數額，是少得多了！</p>
<p>保險公司之收入，一為投保者所付之保費。二為公司投資所得之利益，而其波出則一為損失之賠償，二為營業之費用，收入超過支出時贏餘所得，其効用不外（一）提供意外之損失（二）補給公司之紅利，目前一般保險公司對資金均作種種的投資，其主要者為　不動產。　有價證券如公債股票等。　抵押放款。　現金。　房產租金。　其他產業等六種</p>
<p>脚踏車保險正是和汽車保險相對地興衰的，新保險業務，現在已有數家保險公司在開始經營了！普通脚踏車保險的手續，是由車主將申請書塡就後，携同原車至保險公司交撿査員勘察後，即成立保險手續，申請書內容約略分為　脚踏事之詳細形式·如式樣·牌號·構造·價格·特徵等。　車輪是否在使用式置藏。　車輛是否為私人用處。　使用車輛是否屬於職業上或蘭業上之需要。　除車主本人外又否他人使用。（年齡在十八歲以下及六十歲以上者須加註明。）　被保險之車，以前曾否肇蝸。</p>
<p>至於保險之損害範圍，則包括　損害（如碰撞致受傷損壞）　火險（包括因火或爆炸等致遭損害）　失竊（凡於寓所公共置車塲或辦公所等處失竊均屬此類）　騎乘損害，凡車主於騎乘時，因各種原因致使他人（包括動物）受傷害者或死亡者，均得受賠償之權。</p>
<p>對於保險費率方面，各種均互有差異，主要須視車輛情形而決定。據本埠一家有名保險公司的費率，平均最高每年為百分之一三·三三左右。譬如保險額為一萬元，保險則為七百五十元，在目前脚踏車多事之秋，這費率也不能嫌其過昂哩！</p>
<p>假使說新興保險事業是時代的寵兒，那末脚踏車保險更是道些寵兒中的寵兒了！</p>
<h3 id="c32">應抓手，不夜眼，獅面，裂虘……　麻風人生活寫眞 <a href="#c32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>

<p>盡心盡力求生勇氣依然助已助人友愛精神洋溢</p>
<p>第二種是神經性的。初發時感覺不舒服，酸痛，亦有絕無症象的。後來皮膚局部變為灰白色，變色處麻木，肌肉萎縮，神經麻痺，手指成鷹爪狀，雙眼因神經麻木，不能閉合，睡覺時，亦兩眼張開，成為「不夜眼」。還有一種是皮膚神經兩性兼有的混合性。</p>
<p>麻瘋雖可怕，但不是不治之病。祗要患者不諱疾忌醫，從速醫治，絕無危險。現在麻瘋院中有幾個簡直和常人無異，因為他們一發此症，即行醫治的緣故。預防麻瘋的方法，就是和患者隔絕，一方面注重營養加强抵抗力。假如有人身發紅斑或皮膚變色，可用針刺，生斑或變色的地方，要是不感覺痛，或許有麻瘋嫌疑，請從速往醫診斷。</p>
<p>主辦中華麻瘋醫院的是靜安寺路六一二弄五三號的中華麻瘋救濟會。據該會估計，中國各地有麻瘋病人約一百萬衆，全國共有麻瘋診所四十餘處。自太平洋戰爭爆發後，經費來源大受打擊，國外捐款無不斷絕。而每一麻瘋病人每月約兩百元的費用，却有增無减，所以定自本月十六日起舉行十五萬元的捐款運動，籌募經費，以資維持。</p>
<p>麻瘋是個人的病，防止麻瘋傳染却是社會的工作，社會的責任。無怪乎中華麻瘋救濟會中人所說希望「社會熱心仕女，慷慨解囊」了。（本文完）</p>

<p>— 錢鼎</p>
<p>（二）他鄉遇故知</p>
<p>十六年臘月，在哈爾濱舉　畫展，並作一番酬應之　即乘中東路車，過興安嶺，直到滿洲里，沿途惟見一片氷害，盡是淸凉世界，因寒冷之極，不能往外遊覽寫景，祇有在旅舍看書，或作國畫自遣。居此數日，惟覺孤寂無聞，擬即離去。晨起，先寫信數封，正欲發信之際，忽憶及兩年前曾在北平接得友人董君來自滿洲里一信，吿知在此路局任事，於是隨即試投函，時至午刻，果然有人來探問，推進我房門，竟是董君其人，「見緊緊握手，彼此喜出望外。當此嚴寒邊塞，客居孤寂，今忽千里逢至友，他鄕遇故知，胸中感到無限快慰！董君與我，實同此情景也。他以為我到俄國去，由此經過，想不到我為寫生，乃衝寒踏雪，長途跋涉而來。他要我在此多住幾天，以便暢叙一番。我逢董君於此，實屬難得，亦多以緣叙為樂。他住任同事俄人家裹，因此我寫得一幅俄人多髯的油畫肯像。他這位同事原是舊俄貴族的後裔，革命之後，來到此地，生了許多子女，有兩個年齡不相上下的十四五歲女孩，活潑可愛，總敏勤奮，每犬上學回來，便幫助母親煮飯，整理屋子，赤足刷地板，晚間在燈下同弟弟妹妹做功課、我見他許多孩子，在燈下溫課，或互相問答，眞覺有趣。便在旁用鉛筆速寫幾幅，都被他們索去。董君所住的小小房間，覺幽靜而整潔，壁上掛着他自攝的各唯風景，並掛着他情侶在北平中山園遊玩的照片。他指着照片說，每天要給他一封信，並將她封短札，公開的給我看，這位女子富有文學天才，字迹秀麗，讀之感美。他給我看過後，時時帶着嘆氣說：「怎麽辦呢？」董君是　個富於熱情詼諧而多生趣的靑年，他說到如何達到美滿的結果上，不禁又露出嚴重的意態，說了怎麽辦一聲，看他神情有些苦悶，似乎要同我討論一下，我便對他說，等她大學畢了業，自然會得到　個美滿的結果。隨後他講到中俄在邊境衝突情形，於和平解決後，曾拾得一個空殸炮彈，內裝唐　寄給她的愛人，不料寄到北平是，正値一個嚴里時期，軍警檢査包件，就檢到這笨重可疑的東西，拆開議看，乃赫然一大炮彈，內藏着美麗的糖果，軍警不敢嘗試，以為內中有什麼花巧，即將該件查明地址，嚴詢這可伯可疑的包裹收件人，並在她家裏抄了一下，弄得大家害怕，後來講明了，才算無事。他有許多滑稽的事情，講給我聽，眞覺有趣。他每天辦公下來，就到我族舍談笑，或小酌，或出外踏雪攝影，或邀我到他房東　嘗嘗俄人的家常便飯，或於晚間到俄人俱樂部參加跳舞會，但董君不樂跳舞，竟坐在那裏打瞌睡，我則擺拆字攤，恐竿十其間，看他們的熱鬧。有時旅舍的掌櫃，到我房內來講當地風俗情形，如當帥人在野捕旱獺的情形，又大賴湖中鑿冰捕鯉魚的情形，都極可聽聞。這樣豐富而有趣的生活，不覺過了三十多天，我就決定一個日子，離開這荒凉的境地，那天晚上他送我上車，在寂寞冰淸的景象之下，在火車移動的一霎時問，就悄然握別了。</p>
<p>我離開了哈爾濱，一直到荒凉的邊塞，在此孤寂的旅况中，忽遇釗董君，因此得到豐富而有趣的生活，而董君在愛的黃金時代中，却有具不少的樂趣，亦有算不少的苦悶。在我旅行回到北平後，他也達到理想中美滿的園地。今回憶十四五年前的情景，歷歷如在眼前。人生一如幻景，經過一切努力奮發，苦樂安危，諸多情景，其實都是為着一種愛所衝動；因此我覺得一切生命的存在與其繁榮，皆以愛為源泉，以美為發榮，以眞善為長養。自來人類生活之演進，文物之昌明，如耶穌之為博愛救世，釋迦之證善果，發慈悲，孔孟之講仁義，明人倫，老莊之婦自然，由道德，陽明之求知行合一，學者之明理求眞，藝人之審美游藝，國士之為愛國治政，男女之為愛情結褵，父母之為子女養育，兄弟之如手足相關，朋友之因　道　輔，一切均以愛為原由，一切均在愛中發榮長養。至究其為愛之原可約之為三，即神物與性靈是也，神為形上，永遠不變，物為形下隨時可變，性靈為時中在適其生。我記千山這人之言，所謂使精氣上化，以得其神，為慾心所累，則精神枯槁，其意即人之精神如為慾心所累而枯槁，則物亦無由存在。至此即無眞愛存在，即無生命存在。故任何——會人羣，如多見充滿貪慾夕累，苟安之習，不知在適其生以求眞愛存在，志趣生趣之存在，乃決不能見發榮長養，或竟至瀕於枯槁通境之悲運。由是可知我人之一切生活，其於眞愛之　泉，當日求開發，不可自遏自竭之，使生活園地，失其灌溉而枯涸也。我又想十五年前，我在荒凉孤寂的境界中，竟獲得豐富而有趣的生活，因此又知道董君左眞愛的苦樂中，在生活的努力中，終至獲得了美滿的結果。這似乎有自然的眞神，在從中維護我們，磨練我們，成全我們。由是可知，天助自助者，自己能覺悟，自己能努力，乃决能絕處逢生。現在我們雖然處於繁華的都巿裏，其實更甚於在荒凉孤寂的境界中過生活，但如何還能獲得豐富而有趣的生活，如何還能獲得眞愛和樂的生活？這還是在自己要覺悟，要努力，不要虛妄，不要迷惑，我想大自然的眞神，自會及時降臨，成全一切。</p>

<p>經濟專刋　第四一八期</p>
<p>週間市語</p>
<p>過去一十多天的日子，似乎專備物價賡續上漲而設；民生受高物價壓迫的疾苦，實與儲鈔因高物價而反襯出來的無形蝕偵是同等程度的。那末今次金融變動之後，該有另一步驟出現罷？</p>
<p>現下管理物價，取締投機之說，甚囂鏖上。究竟如何？姑待事實證明。但凡事不離事實，譬如高物價的成因，投機之外，尙有供需上的根本因素。但得而言者，投機果能撲滅，對於疏散本市人口的效力將大著。人口减少，不亦調整供需之一法歟？</p>
<p>退而論物價不斷暴漲，總與通貨數量相關。今日這般連續暴漲之烈，除通貨膨張期所罕見。然則現正以儲鈔一收回法幣二之時期，可謂正在通貨收縮過程中；何以出演此相反現象？蓋因銀行停收法幣現鈔存款，於是周旋於商品交易，證券交易之間；而將幣幣交換過程延展於無形，收縮率乃被流轉率所抵消了。</p>
<p>通貨流旋愈高，通貨之需要即益緊。加以時値端節邊緣，是以本市銀根，不以通貨壅塞而鬆弛。上週錢業拆息由角半增為角七，所增雖微，姿態則同為吿緊。此係又一矛盾。</p>
<p>游資如退出商品投機，則其今後何所歸宿？頗饒興味。華股業已抬頭，但受物價刺激所促成。如果失此因素，則必待發現新標準而後可。</p>
<p>近年地產繁興，人口集中為成因之一；游資過剩亦為成因之一。幣値下降又為另一成因。今後客觀情勢作何轉換？關係至鉅。但窮則工，狹路可以相逢也。此或與人口疏散之象又成另一矛盾歟？</p>
<h3 id="c46">市塲動態 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>公債</p>
<p>上週債市走勢，可稱健飛。各債大都漲起十元左右。中途雖不乏了多，檯向却始終紮住。雙方陣容，與前週大同小異；惟獲利了多者巳較前週為衆。如同順，德孚，胡鶴記，同康等即係個中翹楚。一路瀉出者仍以同利為領袖，惟週初同利進出互有，似曾度動搖其信心者然；但窺其人後續瀉不止，可知係技巧所使然。吸胃雄健者有謙益，順泰，聯和，同源，昌記等等，散多為數亦堪注意。週四漲停板，為變更貨幣單位後之創舉，意義自非等閑可比。週末略見回風，亦不失為重要點綴。但本週動向，關鍵所繫甚大。如果為觀望而靜止，則前途大有苗頭。</p>
<p>外幣</p>
<p>外幣市塲巳目為冷門。唯其如此，就不會被人放過。演出驚人。上週美金鎊已近六百元大關。美金票追踪尤速；講程度：前週金鎊漲力大於金票；上週金票的前進，快過金鎊。</p>
<p>日軍票脚地尙硬，但掛牌穩定性至今惹人注意，月中常是軍票的旺期，目前如何？特饒興味。</p>
<p>港票走勢，步步為營，紮得很緊；週四突來暴風，漲勁猛烈，豈係穩紮穩打的後果。</p>
<p>華股市價，上週尤是生色。連日激漲，非特巳打消改用儲鈔的折半影響，且都越出一比一的比率而復大漲不止。此係一般物價如此漲法的結果，原無足怪。如果物價上漲不止，股市前途亦未可限量，豈不也合邏輯之預測？</p>
<p>時値學期交替，文化股當然得令，商務一馬當先，中華，世界也追踪直上。紡織股跟緊紗布，死不放鬆。巿塲台柱的新藥股，如新亞，中法，都是飛黃騰達；五洲藥房，只有喊買，沒有賣聲。眞可謂奇貨可居。中國內衣初漲後疲，獨呈特徵。</p>
<p>邇來巿間盛傳取締投機之說，一旦實現，投機範圍則益見狹小，其時所能容納游　者，恐唯華股市塲歟？</p>
<p>外股</p>
<p>上週外股巿價，受華股狂漲刺激，亦急戰十漲：風暴之烈，堪相匹敵。華股暴漲於週二三兩天，外股暴漲於週四。華股漲風持續有力，外股一漲即止；可見已成氣泡性質。向為外股牛耳之會德豐，邇來暮氣沉沉，上週內又有返老還童之概，週三最低價僅六十九元半，翌日即達八十四元半，但週五急回七十二元：誠如風燭殘年。紡織外股不讓華紡；橡皮股步漲有序；實業股榮辱互見；地產股銳氣中平。公用事業股疾進無比，為各股之首。此加價與改用備鈔的副產品也。惟整肅巿塲之說，現正甚囂塵上；如係事實，外股恐難倖免歟？</p>
<p>商品</p>
<p>烟市：各檔烟價，一致飛昇；銳氣之甚，不以霉季而遜色：洵為歷來所希見。市傳派貨無着，又有行將提高廠盤。實則利用日商烟廠合併。暫停派貨，硬抬巿價耳。且烟市至今仍做法幣交易，變更貨幣單位原非常事，投機者自不肯錯過機會。然則本巿烟業，已被統制。非其他自由商品可比。最近華中七大日商烟廠，（東洋，武漢華生，共盛，興亞，東亞，華北東亞，中外產業。合併設立之中華烟草株式會社，業已成立，資本增至三千百七十萬元，擁有工廠十所（上海七處，漢口二處），年產能力增達一百三十萬萬枝，前途已可想見。今之抬價，或具二種作用：一為準備二比一改做儲鈔交易時不致比他貨落後，再則新公司開業在即，新貨派出，　戶的存貨出路必窮，尤其在此霉季，曷不我個脫手良機？則今之種種，顯係欲縱故擒，新陳代謝前的一幕捉放曹罷了。</p>
<p>西藥：西藥交易，新舊幣互用，價格參差，大勢趨漲，較他貨則緩慢。良以客銷觀望，常業者又嚴防囤戶活動；故市氣最見正常；在百物暴漲聲中，獨西藥砥柱中流，實為難能可　。</p>
<p>雜糧：豆麥上市巳旺，但到貨未暢，故蠶豆巿氣緊俏，較前週　二十元左右。大豆漲風相若；麩皮貨缺價堅；新麥如神龍之見首不見尾，蓋受嚴格統制故耳。蕪湖當地，日有百包左右交易，崑山出貨亦衆；售價每石二百三十元左右。赤豆存底雖厚價仍挺秀。</p>
<p>油餅：華北花生，生油價雖見跌落，本市獨呈堅佾。週二起，零售食油統制價均一致掛昇兩元。餅市交易不寂，市氣榮辱互見，全週有十元左右波動。</p>
<p>燭皂火柴：燭皂火柴，向追烟市；値此烟價高抬，燭皂火柴自難例外。囤戶不顧統制依舊，不情高價搜求。市氣之盛，不亞烟市。</p>
<p>紗布</p>
<p>連週暴漲，不一而足；週初在統制說中開盤，寬仍　漲不已；</p>
<p>現紗雖也跟着廠單激昇，但不如廠單，落得很後，所以愈軋愈遠。疋頭市氣，不　紗市。但週末人氣　怯，出現全週最高最低價間一二十元差額。</p>
<h3 id="c47">塲外雜談 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>兩相界當局此次開徵零售捐百分之二。旣名零售捐，批發自屬免稅。然則零售與批發如何區別？若從行號性質分，專營批發或零售者果不成問題，但兼營批發與零售者實繁有夥。若從交易總値分，即若干元下課稅，之上免稅。但貨價高低懸殊，非一一規定免稅點不可：但手續未免太煩；依余所見，莫若從各貨交易量分，即購買同類貨若干件上免稅之下課稅；較為簡易。若兩者不予區別，不免發生二重稅三重稅乃至無限重稅，物價的增漲就大有可觀了。不過零售捐的本質，照理決非構成目前物價的因素！</p>
<p>團戶的魔手，似在伸人五金界。然而這是軍需物資；上週與亞院華中連絡部L對日僑發出金屬動員令。徵發銅鐵製品，限九月底前一律繳出。徵發範圍經指定者。</p>

<h3 id="c48">氣候造成天才 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— 何凱</p>
<p>全國科學協會是美國最高深的科學硏究機關。它的三百個會員每二年集會一次，以討論科學界最近的發見。在上一次大會中會員們聽到驚人的消息，說是天才是由氣侯造成的。提出這理論的是伊里諾斯大學的彼得遜敎授。</p>
<p>細査「美國名人錄」，「美國傳記辭典」，「德國名人錄」和「美國科學家人名錄」的結果，彼得遜博士收集二萬五千個名人的資料。他把關於這些人的紀錄和瘋人與囚犯的紀錄比較一下。</p>
<p>他們的生日據說是無關緊要的，可是他非常注重他們受胎的大致的日期。</p>
<p>他的統計表示凡是在上半年懷孕的人有着較其他人更異常的頭腦：這些人裏面包括更多的天才和更多的狂人。</p>
<p>試將這法則應用到三十一位美國總統身上，他發見有一十六個總統（這包括華盛頓，林肯，威爾遜和羅斯福）是在七月前受胎的。只有五位總統　（這包括塔扶特，柯立芝和胡佛）是在十月十一月和十二月懷孕的。</p>
<p>彼得遜博士認為這旣不是由於占星家所說的行星的配置，也不是受着任何神秘的影響；只是氣候在作祟吧。</p>
<p>在北半球，上半年是風暴時期，這影響及於母體和在懷孕的最初數星期中最敏感的胎兒。在比較平穩而無風暴的秋季懷孕將產生身心平衡的，正常而溫文的孩子。而在春季則容易產生天才與異常兒童以及易於患精神病的人們。</p>

<h3 id="c49">深海之民探隱 <a href="#c49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— 星花</p>
<p>幾十年前，人們都以為在深海底裏，動物是完全不能生存的。後來，經過許多科學家用器械採取海底動物的標本，知道事實並不如此。他們發現魚類，蛤類和甲殼類，即使輭體的莞葵　都能在海而下三英里處生活。</p>
<p>在海底日光不能到達，而許多動物郤生有眼睛，我們也許會這樣猜想：牠們自生至死也沒有機會去用眼睛，因為在絕對黑暗之中，是不能看見任何東西的。我們知道——貓之所以能在黑暗中看到景物，因為即使在深夜裏，總是有少些光綫，而牠的眼球會把光綫集中起來的緣故。但是，在全暗的深海底，這種動物的眼睛也是無所用了。好在，海底裏有許多魚類全身能發燐光，這光綫從身上黏液內發出。魚類是好奇的，尤其對於光耀的東西，所以漁夫常常把錫片繫在鈎上去誘捉魚類。而有幾種發光的魚也同能使用牠發光的脊，飢餓的時候，放在嘴前擺動，使近邊的小魚都來探視，立即捕來果腹。但道種魚也常被牠的近親族——專捕魚的蛙（也是魚類）所食，這蛙在近海面是不易捉到的。當捕獲之後，立即剖開來，在牠胃裏發現竟容納了七十五隻鯡魚之多。另一條呢，生前吞進了十五條比目魚。</p>
<p>深海裹的鰻，也能呑下比自身還大的食物，牙牀同蛇的一樣特別寬大，喉嚨身體都具有彈性。杷牠捉上海面，第一隻鰻的肚內容下捲縮的比它長三倍的其他動物。第二隻裏而藏了比自身五倍重的犧牲者。還有一隻吃得太飽了？幾乎使牠的鰭脫節。這世界就是大魚吃小魚的世界。</p>
<p>海底動物必須忍受種不可思議的壓力，我們住在回海水等高的空氣之下，每平方英寸面上尙且有十五磅的壓力呢！何况是水，所以有經騐的潛水夫也不能達到海面下三百呎之處。而魚類能受這兩噸半以上的壓力——等於二十五倍推動火車高速行駛的力量。這似乎是不可能的，但，生活在海底的動物郤多着呢！這問題還等待解決。我們可以這樣回答：因為牠們的身體組織很脆，假使沒有多量的水去把握是很難行動的，在牠們鰾和血液裏都儲藏或溶有氣體，使各方面的壓力相同。有時，它們高出了原在地位，由於外表壓力减小，內部壓力迫使內臟推向口腔，眼球突出於眼圈之外，牠的形體就和原來不同了，所以牠們伏在深海底裹不牧游向上面。</p>

<h3 id="c50">友情 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— 理權</p>
<p>彼此友情的成立或加深，普通是相五有着共同的與趣和見解，但生活實踐的協調之外，每每不能一直永久維持彼此的友情。要想將友情維持得永久，像由初戀到勢戀，由熱戀到偕白首，那必須要有深摯的情感和生活實踐的理解，時時去培植它</p>
<p>如此的友情培植，和培植一個欣欣向榮的花枝，又有甚麽不同的地方！世間最可怕的友情，是將友情組製濫做設着待。你隨便的亂用友情，這是你的自由，友情決不是狗肉般的。我們要是拿功利來付度友情，那是，完了，甚麽都</p>
<p>彼此之間，可以不可以坦白相對？坦白會不會使友情毀滅？</p>
<p>不，決不會的。坦白只有增進彼此的友誼，但坦白只限不損轡了彼此生活方式的尊嚴。不論誰都應有容納他人的坦白批評。一切的批評的出發點都是來自眞正愛護我們的，我們決對沒有拒絕的理由，我們甚至還要感謝坦白批評我們的人們。</p>
<p>可是我們要注意世間的小人，他們會妨礙了我們工作和生活的勇氣。還有一些從旁人處聽來對我們小有反感的話，毫不吝嗇的如實吿訴給我們聽的那種人，也是不忠實的友人，並且還有危險。他們所以要如此的做，那是因為旁人是怎樣吿訴他的，他要在這上面，獲得自我的快感。</p>

<p>— 史東</p>
<p>印度人是非常注重禮儀的；在這禮儀中似乎含着我們所意想不到的神秘的成分。</p>
<p>例如，當他們接到請帖時，他們第一件須幹的事，是叫發請帖者所住的鎭上的理髮師來理髮。倘使這是婚禮的邀請時，理髪師尙須對被邀者授以種種必需的禮節。</p>
<p>遇到發請帖者是貴人的時候，理髮師須一一訪問被邀者，示以全部賓客的名單，而道名單父由各人簽字。可見印度的理髮師是交際界中不可或缺的人物。</p>
<p>赴宴席時男女決不同往。他們完全採取個別行動。</p>
<p>女人乘着周圍遮沒的車輛到會塲去。一到會塲，招待員就會大聲報吿女賓的來到，導入女賓室中。在這時候，如果叫喚女人的名字，據說是非常失禮的。</p>
<p>男賓們被導入大客廳，舖上地毯，等着盛饌的分派。印度婚禮席上的菜肴是千篇一律的。那是一盤馬鈴薯湯和放着肉，牛乳和乳油燒烘的麵包。</p>
<p>道被放在地上，於是大家就踞着取食。</p>
<p>不論在吃東西或喝水時，他們是忌用左手的。因為用左手取食將被目為野蠻人呢。</p>

<p>— 余新恩</p>
<p>（四）自助與互助</p>
<p>當今生活極度艱難的時候，惟有自助互助的方法為最切實。在這囤藥的風氣中，若不幸生病，光一筆藥費也就很可觀了。為避免這種不幸，莫如保持健康。耍保持健康，不外乎飲食起居衛生，這些看來不足輕重，但實佔據主要地位。若果我們吃得合適，睡得充足，至少我們原有的抵抗力不會降落不可防禦疾病。充足睡眠並無需費用，也不用　水加一。食物的費用雖已高漲許多，但我們可向他方面去節省，而獨不要在飯食方面去打算盤，就為的要避免生病。在巳往的收入中，只一部分是為飯食用的，其他則為了衣着，交際，應酬，塲面，娛樂許多項目。現在，不得不重行支配用途了。縮小其他範圍，大家實行儉樸之風，這樣可在飯食上多點　鹽，也就是對於自身的健康多層保障。</p>
<p>此外，種正當的健康保險制度也有實施的必要，為的是自助和互助。每人出力所能及的很小的費用，合起來就可成為一大筆經費，可為不幸生病者的醫藥費。如果你在這年頭不生病，那就是你的大幸。你這點點的款項，可以用為幫助那些小幸生病的，免得他們為了自身經濟的不是而要坐以待斃。同樣的，如果你自身生病了，也可享受此同等權利。我們不妨照這原則去實行，小規模的可聚合十數個家庭分派　備一定款項為緊急醫　之用。不是說你這個月不生病就吃虧了，而是你幫助了別人。在這時候，惟有自助和互助，方是最切實的方策。</p>
<p>醫生與病人，都是向着健康的道上去奮鬭，由疾病轉到健康；但是，讓我們更進步，就是預防疾病，保持健康！（完）</p>

<p>— 劍農</p>
<p>弱小動物的處身在這優勝劣敗强生弱死的世界戰塲上。就好像我們人遭逢着亂世一樣。他們為苟延殘喘計，不能不借助於特異的技能或巧妙的方術。這除了以前談過的「偽裝」大部分也可歸入此例外，再揀幾個普通的談談。</p>
<p>捷足</p>
<p>弱小動物不幸而遇有大敵當前，最簡單的應付方法，就是怕而遠之的三十六計。走為上計！北平人所謂：「大爺！你利害？不惹你！」可是要想走要能走麼，那當然得有一雙飛雲掣雷的「捷足」了。你看那奔跑起來儼如飛箭離弦似的野兎，儼如身傳雙翼似的斑馬；有那竄山跳澗如履平地轉眼就不見蹤影的赤鹿和羚羊等，便是些最普通的例子。要是勉强找幾個古人和牠們相比的話，是否擬於不倫？我看却有些像避難遼東的管幼安，或遁跡海外的朱舜水、</p>
<p>拔身</p>
<p>蝗　或跳蚤等逃命的法子呢，却仗恃着一雙非紫强載而有力的彈簧式的大腿：牠們一看風色有些不對，便踴身一躍的高高跳在天空，給你一個措手不汝，無處捉摸！這種在千鈞一髮的危殆時期却能够「拔身」而出的舉動，不是有些彷彿掛冠返里的漢逢萌，棄官歸吳的晋張翰麽？</p>
<p>高隱</p>
<p>有一種名叫「偕老同穴」——或愛神的花籃——的海綿，牠的形狀彷彿　筩，渾身裹有無數柱狀而多孔的骨片，顏色雪白，儼如用銀絲織就的網目一般。因為牠身體的組織是食　的大魚所不能咀嚼的，於是在牠那中空的廣腔內，便常有一對恩愛的小夫妻——儷蝦，無憂無慮的隱居着：牠名叫「偕老同穴的原因，就在這裹。這一對小夫妻麽，我很願意把牠們比作鹿車共挽的梁鴻和孟光！</p>
<p>深藏</p>
<p>上食塙壤下飲黃泉的蚯蚓，行動遲緩目光晦澀的鼴鼠等，因為世界上沒有牠們用武的餘地，便只好退避三舍的把頭埋在深深的地下層中。就是那頂盔貫甲似　頗有英雄氣概的犰狳，一遇有危險也便用牠那一對比鐵鏟還鋒利的前爪，三掘兩掘，儼如士行孫會地遁術似的很快的，鑽到地中心去！這種深自韜晦以求全身的舉止，也可見之於因樹為屋的申屠蟠，或藏身土室的李二曲等。</p>
<p>自汚</p>
<p>有些動牧，為的苟全性命，致不惜用「自汚」的手段以完成其目的譬如泥蟲的用糞穢蔽體，吹沫蟲的用泡沫裏身，椿象的身發惡臭，還有許多別的吐臭水放臭氣的動物。牠們意思好像向追求者說：「在下不中吃，不敢勞駕，請另覔佳　吧」！這種可憐的避禍手段，又不由叫人想起那墮簡失儀的司空圖，裸體佯狂的唐伯虎來！</p>

<p>六·一彈指</p>
<p>過了三四天，維城天天在屈指算着，翠珍姊也許要回來了，有時候偶然想起黃龍，覺得黃龍這人，有些神龍見首不見尾，不希望他來，他倒突然之間來了，希望他來，他簡直是不來。維城的思慮，對於黃龍，不過是偶然的；偶然的事情，只一會兒功夫又淡然了。他在寢窒裏，想來一次午睡，才躺下去，覺得午睡沒有意思，又不是夏日炎炎的季節。走到雙梅書屋裹，翻幾本古人的詩文集來看看，看不到十分鐘，倒又看不下了。惘然的出鬥，看天際陰雲四合有些雨意。一想不錯，快到淸明了，有所說的，淸明時節雨紛紛，大槪老天已經在準備着過淸明。春風在脚底下，微微的吹起他那件淡灰布罩衫；同時也從袴腿裏，拂拂的吹了進去。向東走了幾步，見河灘的蘆茅，在爭先恐後的探出頭來。楊柳條子，着了幾點靑翠，便顯得格外是柔條。沒多少日子來和大自然接觸，大自然巳是變了樣子。日裏麥葉，蓬蓬勃勃的，把桿子下邊的泥土，全給遮蔽：來一陣風，那麥葉也波浪似的在一起一伏，閃出那畫工畫不來的美態。</p>
<p>維城暫時忘了是居喪，信步所之，迎着春風往東去了。他在想，天如果下雨，也不過細雨，有針一樣的細雨，刺到臉上來，給我一些不痛不癢的刺激，就算是消遣的一法吧。他一路向前走着，瞧見徐全福和何子興在船上捻泥。這沈澱在河底裏的淤泥，夾起來便可以做壅田的肥料，是一種古來相傳的培壅方法。把淤泥做肥料，維城並不反對。當時在岸上問道：「你們兩個在這裏，阿興呢？」何子與道：「阿興在墳地上，大太太的新墳，前回沒有把土堆得怎樣高。兩天了，阿興是去做墳的。」維城點點頭，又往東走了。何子興道：「少爺天說不定要下雨呢，你往那裹去？」維城不回頭，只把手舉的高過肩胛，搖了搖，表示沒關係。（一〇二）</p>

<p>German Headquarters, 14th, Huitong News Agency – The progress of the North African war situation is beneficial to the German and Italian forces. After our army penetrated deep into enemy lines, British armored vehicles suffered losses of 54 vehicles, and 400 soldiers were captured. German fighter planes shot down Soviet aircraft. German aircraft attacked the British escort fleet in the Mediterranean, sinking one 5,000-ton cargo ship and severely damaging two large ships and one escort ship. German submarines sank one enemy patrol boat and one ammunition transport ship.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 14th, "Huitong News Agency" – According to news received here, the British military authorities in Cairo stated yesterday that fierce fighting has occurred 20 kilometers south of Tobruk. A large German force has arrived on the road from Tobruk to El Adem and intends to shift the British front line to the Gazala area. The British commander has dispatched a large number of mechanized units to reinforce and prevent the defense line from being cut off.</p>
<p>Cairo, 13th, Havas News Agency – Military authorities here frankly admit that the vast desert area south of Knightsbridge in Libya has been occupied by the Axis forces. British mobile units are now striving to prevent the enemy from advancing further. Fierce fighting is also taking place in the Tobruk-El Adem area. According to Reuters, German forces may advance east of El Adem, but only with advance units.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 14th, Huitong News Agency – According to Cairo news received by this evening newspaper in London, after Bir Hakeim fell, the battle has developed northward towards Tobruk. Although the city's defenses have not yet been attacked, they are feared to soon fall into the battle line. The British army has apparently been unable to stop the German advance. Since Friday, the British Air Force has concentrated on bombing German and Italian reinforcements, while another part resists German aircraft attacks. According to Reuters, German air raids are extremely fierce, so British fighters must remain in the air from morning to night. London admits that the area south of Knightsbridge has been controlled by German forces. The mechanized units on both sides are now considered evenly matched.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 14th, Huitong News Agency – According to local newspapers, the British press is gradually expressing pessimism about the war news and commentary in Libya. The British press admits that Tobruk is under threat, that General Rommel has again knocked on the doors of Egypt, and hopes that General Ritchie can avert the crisis as a last resort. The southernmost base of the British army's triangular stronghold has been occupied by German and Italian forces, and its western defense line has also been partially destroyed. The central communication in the war zone is also cut off. All commentators believe that the situation is extremely serious. The only hope is that Knightsbridge can still hold firm. The British side admits that after the German army occupied Bir Hakeim, its supply line has greatly improved. A Swedish reporter said that the situation of the British army in Marmarica is also very critical.</p>

<p>Berlin, 14th, Huitong News Agency – According to German military sources, after the fall of Bir Hakeim, it was discovered that the fortifications there were better than expected.

<h3 id="e5">German Submarine Achievements <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 13th, Allied News Agency – A German command headquarters recently announced a special war report stating that German submarines operating in the Atlantic have attacked enemy merchant fleets escorted by warships and trade routes patrolled by the US Navy in the past few days. After fierce battles with enemy ships, one destroyer and 27 ships were sunk, totaling 149,200 tons. In the past six days, German submarines have sunk one destroyer and 40 merchant ships, totaling 212,200 tons, off the US Atlantic coast, and in the Panama Canal, the Caribbean Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th, Huitong News Agency – In the past week, British and American forces have increased the number of warships and aircraft patrolling the sea to prevent German submarines from attacking merchant ships, but the activities of German submarines have not been hindered. A ship sailing from the Panama Canal to Australia was sunk by a German submarine one night. Another ship, although escorted by a destroyer, was also sunk when leaving the Panama Canal. A German submarine attacked an escort fleet including three ships and one destroyer, sinking one cargo ship. One oil tanker was also hit and caught fire.

<h3 id="e7">Britain and the United States Pay Attention to Manufacturing Artificial Rubber <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 14th, Huitong News Agency – According to the "New York Daily News," Palachelle, a senior official of the Asiatic Petroleum Company, told the Gilley Committee that the United States does not yet have a method of manufacturing artificial rubber from petroleum that can be used for large-scale production. The Gilley Committee was established to improve methods and experience in manufacturing artificial rubber. Palachelle said that the results obtained by American experts were no better than his. The "New York Daily News" said that the Gilley Committee is testing the use of alcohol from grains to manufacture artificial rubber, so that farmers can benefit. Some members of the committee condemned the Washington administration for not allowing large oil companies in the United States to obtain patents for manufacturing artificial rubber, because the method of manufacturing artificial rubber from alcohol has been invented for a long time, while the method of manufacturing artificial rubber from petroleum is still under study, so at least people should have commercial competition opportunities. Palachelle admitted in the Gilley Committee that the method of manufacturing artificial rubber from alcohol is more convenient, but the London Times recently received a dispatch from Washington stating that the US government opposes the use of alcohol to manufacture artificial rubber because alcohol is needed for the manufacture of explosives. London is also paying close attention to the production of artificial rubber. The "Manchester Guardian" recently obtained a letter from an official of the British Labor Union requesting that Britain immediately establish two factories for manufacturing artificial rubber. The official said that the United States will be able to produce 700,000 tons of artificial rubber in 1943, but this harvest is too late. He advocated that the state manage the production of artificial rubber and that large-scale production must be planned and implemented immediately. The London "Daily Telegraph" asked London residents to return the rubber earplugs distributed when German aircraft began bombing London in the summer of 1940, which shows the lack of rubber in Britain.</p>

<h3 id="e17">Sevastopol Port: Soviet Defenders Retreat; Fierce Fighting in Izium and Novok; News of Developments on Arctic Front <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Headquarters, 14th, Huitong News Agency – This afternoon's German war report stated that the German army, launching a fierce attack on the suburbs of Sevastopol, has penetrated deep into enemy lines. The enemy's defenses are particularly strong, and the terrain is superior, making it easy to defend and difficult to attack. However, the extremely new "Stalin Fortress" was occupied by the German army. Soviet counterattacks were all repelled. An attempt to reach the southern entrance of Sevastopol was made by a Soviet transport ship (10,000 tons), which was sunk by German aircraft. In Crimea, German aircraft destroyed one Soviet ship and damaged one enemy destroyer. The Soviet army trapped east of Kharkov was partially defeated, partially captured, and the rest are being pursued. 20,000 have already been captured, 169 enemy tanks and 113 artillery pieces were destroyed. In addition, a large amount of military supplies were seized by the German army or destroyed by the German army, resulting in heavy losses. There is still fighting on the central and northern fronts. A Soviet army attacking Volov was repelled. German aircraft attacked Murmansk and the Ruxi railway station. Aircraft engaged with Soviet aircraft, shooting down 11 enemy aircraft. Our aircraft suffered no losses. Six out of seven Soviet aircraft attempting to attack the rear were shot down.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 14th, Huitong News Agency – Today's Reuters telegram to the United States stated that Soviet troops have withdrawn from the naval base of Sevastopol, and the defenders there are also withdrawing.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 13th, Havas News Agency – This afternoon's newspaper reported that the Sevastopol garrison, unable to stop the German advance, is said to have begun to withdraw, and a large number of troops have been withdrawn from the port by sea. The German army is now deploying artillery positions in new positions, and its assault troops have broken through a certain defense line in several places. Red Army counterattacks are said to have been repelled.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Ukrainian border, 13th, Havas News Agency – The fighting in Sevastopol has intensified in recent days. The besieged Red Army fought a desperate battle yesterday, attempting to break out, but was repelled by the German army. The German army took advantage of the victory to advance and tried to use heavy tanks to break into the northeast gap of the city. At the same time, another mechanized unit launched a fierce attack on the north of the city. Based on the German Supreme Command's mobilization of a large number of troops to attack the port, it can be seen that the German side has decided to quickly eliminate the last base of the Soviets in Crimea. As for the true intentions of the Red Army, it is still unknown at this time. It is still difficult to say whether the garrison intends to withdraw or to defend the port to the death. It is said that the Red Army has a large amount of military equipment and ammunition in the port, and there is no shortage of supplies. The positions it currently holds are also very good, but it cannot counterattack, nor can it transfer reinforcements from other places, so it is likely to have to give up. However, the chance of a breakout by the garrison is also extremely slim. The reason for this is that German aircraft patrol the coast of the Black Sea all day long, and the Red Army's retreat would be bombed by German aircraft. However, several Soviet destroyers have recently arrived in the port, but it is still questionable whether they are there to escort withdrawing ships. In addition, the German army on the Kharkov front has recently launched offensives in the Izium and Novok areas, and the war situation has therefore become more intense again. It is expected that there will be significant developments within days. The German side believes that the Red Army has withdrawn east of Kharkov along the Donets River, but the Soviet side says that the Red Army has already established defensive positions there.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 14th, Havas News Agency – According to recent German news, Germany has transferred a large number of tanks, aircraft, and infantry to the Murmansk area as reinforcements, and it is expected that there will be important developments on the Arctic front soon.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Naval and Air Battle in the Harbor <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 14th, Huitong News Agency: According to official reports, German bombers and dive bombers fiercely bombed military targets, artillery positions, and ammunition depots in Sevastopol the day before yesterday. The losses were significant, and gasoline depots were also hit. German aircraft strafed trucks transporting supplies to the front lines. German "Heinkel 111" bombers successfully attacked Soviet barracks, penetrating heavy anti-aircraft fire. German aircraft also heavily damaged several warships and merchant ships in the harbor. Seven Soviet aircraft were shot down in aerial combat. Shipyards and various areas of the city of Sevastopol were on fire, which lasted for several days. The harbor has been blocked by sunken ships. German bombers continue to attack the city, and fighter planes also dropped light bombs. Because the airfields near Sevastopol have been bombed by German aircraft, only a few Soviet aircraft have flown in from the Caucasus coast to fight.</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th, Huitong News Agency: Authoritative sources here declared that German aircraft bombed the port of Sevastopol yesterday, and an enemy merchant ship (10,000 tons) was hit and heavily damaged, sinking within 30 minutes. Several Soviet warships, including a destroyer, were also hit. German aircraft also assisted the army in combat, bombing defensive works in the fortress area, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy.</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th, Huitong News Agency: According to authorities here, railways, stations, and rear transportation lines on the southern route of the Eastern Front were bombed by large numbers of enemy aircraft, causing significant damage. Many trains were destroyed, and several stations caught fire. German fighter planes shot down a total of 23 Soviet aircraft on the southern route. On the northern route, German warplanes attacked Soviet positions and several key points southeast of Lake Ilmen. Several Soviet ammunition depots experienced major explosions. Other bomber squadrons attacked enemy rear railway stations, and one freight car was hit and burned. During aerial combat, three enemy aircraft were shot down.</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th, Huitong News Agency: German war correspondent Li Gan reported that the current war in Sevastopol is one of the fiercest battles on the Eastern Front. The German forces encountered steel and concrete defensive works in this area, and the enemy hid behind them, unafraid of bombs and shells. However, the strategy adopted by the Soviet army is fundamentally flawed, because the Soviet army believes that defensive works can win against an opponent's attack, which is not the case. Therefore, the troops defending each Soviet defensive work are simply inhuman machines, and the result is only significant sacrifice without any achievement. The only military weapon behind the infantry in the German offensive in Sevastopol this time is anti-aircraft artillery, so it is quite vulnerable to Soviet bombing during the advance. Moreover, because the surrounding mountains are full of lookouts and trenches, and machine gunners are hidden in the forests, the Soviet army launches attacks from all directions under the cover of artillery fire when German anti-aircraft artillery bombard them. Although the Soviet artillery positions are also sharp, they have ultimately failed to stop the German advance.</p>

<p>Turkish Capital, 10th, Havas News Agency: According to unconfirmed reports, another American aircraft landed in Diyarbakır, Turkey (60 miles from the Syrian border). It is rumored that these five American bombers that have landed in Turkey one after another are on a special mission over the Balkan Peninsula, generally attempting to fly to the Soviet port of Sevastopol, but were chased by German aircraft, forcing them to land in Turkey.</p>
<p>Turkish Capital, 14th, Huitong News Agency: Sources here said that on the 12th of this month, an American "Flying Fortress" made an emergency landing near Adana, Turkey.</p>

<p>Prague, 14th, Huitong News Agency: According to official reports, the acting protector of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, Heydrich, announced a plan to reorganize the government before his assassination. This plan will be implemented in a few days. Political figures here believe that this measure indicates that Germany's attitude towards the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia has not changed due to Heydrich's assassination, and the power of the Czech autonomous government may increase after the reorganization.</p>

<p>Swiss Capital, 13th, Havas News Agency: According to news from Berlin, after the assassination of Heydrich, the German administrative official in the Czech Republic, the German administrative institutions there will be thoroughly reformed. The powers of the governor's office will be expanded, and a new agency will be established to oversee police affairs. Furthermore, Lidice Town has been destroyed by the authorities for hiding the murderers. It is said that this is the final means of punishing the Czech people.</p>
<p>Prague, 13th, Havas News Agency: Regarding the assassination of Heydrich, the local radio station recently broadcast a message stating that eight more residents of this city have been shot for instigating the assassination beforehand. Another civil servant was executed for dereliction of duty. In addition, 15 people were shot in Brno, including two engineers, one professor, one woman, and several civil servants. The reasons for their execution were the same as those executed in Prague: assisting in concealing the murderers. The German authorities had warned the people that anyone who concealed the murderers or knowingly concealed the murderers' whereabouts without reporting them to the authorities would be sentenced to death.</p>
<p>Dublin, 13th, Havas News Agency: Although various newspapers in London have called for an invasion of the European continent, various circles in Britain are still concerned that the German army may invade the British mainland this summer. Some newspapers even believe that even though the German army is fighting on the Eastern Front, it is still possible to attack Britain at the same time. Among them, "The Times" stated: "The crisis of German invasion still exists, and the men and women of our country should keep this in mind." Furthermore, "The Daily Telegraph" stated: "Today, the possibility of the German army landing on the British mainland is no different than it was a year ago."</p>
<p>Lisbon, 14th, Huitong News Agency: According to London's "News Chronicle," the acting Bishop of Nottingham, England, Noel Bosi, was preparing to hold a demonstration on the anniversary of the Soviet Union's entry into the war on the 21st of this month, but the city's People's Defense Committee prohibited public groups from participating, and a fierce dispute has already occurred.</p>
<p>Moscow, 13th, Havas News Agency: According to an official announcement, the US-Soviet Mutual Assistance Agreement was signed in Washington on the 11th of this month by Soviet Ambassador to the US, Litvinov, and US Secretary of State, Hull, and took effect immediately. It is said that this agreement does not contain any special clauses, and generally states that the signatory countries have decided to work together to establish a reasonable, fair, and permanent peace based on the principles of the Atlantic Charter, and agree to help each other. In addition, there is another provision that the two governments will provide material assistance to each other and exchange information on various possibilities at any time. The Soviet Union must repay the price of the military equipment supplied by the United States, but the United States should provide all convenience to develop economic relations between the two countries so that the Soviet Union can repay its debts.</p>
<p>Rumors of Secret Clauses in the Anglo-Soviet Agreement</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th, Huitong News Agency: Political figures here believe that the Anglo-Soviet Agreement is different from the US-Soviet Agreement. Because the Anglo-Soviet Agreement has secret clauses, the German Foreign Ministry believes that President Roosevelt refused to sign an agreement identical to the Anglo-Soviet Agreement because he feared that Congress would reject the secret clauses of the agreement. A German Foreign Ministry spokesman pointed out that newspapers in various countries no longer feel excited about Molotov's visit to Britain and the United States because this visit has no significant meaning.</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th, Huitong News Agency: A local observer here commented on the recently established agreements between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, stating that this war will not be determined by documents, speeches, plans, or threats, but on the battlefield. Britain seems to believe that it can hand over Europe to the Soviet Union and still have a say in Europe. Britain believes that signing this treaty will increase its strength, but in reality, the ill-fated destinies of the three countries will not change as a result. Britain and the United States are working hard to supply the Soviet Union with military equipment, which shows that they know very well that if the Soviet Union's resistance collapses, their own situation will also be hopeless. The German General Summary commented that the enemy's secret groping in combat and the lack of goals in the war are sufficient to guarantee our victory. A Berlin local daily newspaper stated that Britain and the Soviet Union have already been fighting us, and the United States has long been providing military aid to the Soviet Union, so this treaty cannot change the situation and only shows the difficult situation of Britain and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Sweden and Norway are Both Anxious</p>
<p>Swedish Capital, 14th, Huitong News Agency: Swedish newspapers are very anxious about the Anglo-Soviet Agreement. People here believe that this agreement only confirms the rumors after Eden's visit to Moscow. The prestige of Britain and the United States is declining more and more in Northern Europe. Norwegian people also fear that the Soviet Union will occupy Norwegian seaports for the "security" of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Romanian Capital, 13th, Havas News Agency: Responsible sources here stated that the establishment of the Anglo-Soviet alliance has not changed the international situation at all. The clauses regarding abandoning territorial ambitions and non-interference in other countries' internal affairs are purely propaganda, because Romania has long understood the extent to which the Soviet Union adheres to treaties. In short, Romania is determined to continue fighting until it achieves final victory.</p>
<p>Turkey's Neutral Stance Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>Tokyo, 14th, Allied News Agency: According to the Asahi Shimbun, citing a Stan-fortre report, informed Turkish sources believe that the conclusion of the Anglo-Soviet Agreement is only related to post-war issues and has no real significance for the future development of the war. Furthermore, the Anglo-Soviet opposition caused by the Atlantic Charter still exists. Romania is in a very difficult situation on this Eastern Front, so it requires the formation of a second front, but its disappointment is also clearly visible. As for the establishment of this agreement, it has no impact on Turkey's international relations. Regardless of the content of the Anglo-Soviet agreement, Turkey's fundamental policy of maintaining a strict neutral stance will not change in the slightest.</p>
<p>Rome, 14th, Huitong News Agency: Last night, an official announcement stated that the Italian Navy recently achieved victory in the Black Sea, stating that Italian Mada torpedo boats operating in the Black Sea do not pass through the Dardanelles in order to respect Turkey's neutrality, but their route was not disclosed.</p>

<p>Originally, even before the First World War, the Jews already had a movement to return to their homeland called Zionism. This movement began in the 16th century and became more prevalent in the 19th century, led by Herzl and Kalischer. In 1894, France issued a major case of anti-Semitism by Dreyfus. A Jewish Dr. Herzl then vigorously promoted Zionism, and the Jews also began to automatically move to Palestine.</p>
<p>During the First World War, the British wanted to use the funds of British Jews, so they always tried to win them over. At first, they promised to allow the Jews to immigrate to Uganda in Africa, giving the Jews a national home. The Jews were a little unwilling. Later, Britain became increasingly short of alcohol, which was necessary for manufacturing explosives. A Jewish scholar, Dr. Weizmann, researched and was able to obtain alcohol from wood. Britain's alcohol problem was solved. This invention made the British very grateful. At that time, British Prime Minister Lloyd George said that Weizmann's genius had really saved Britain. Therefore, the British government, in order to repay his great kindness, asked Weizmann what he wanted as a reward. Weizmann replied that he wanted Britain to help the Jews establish a national home in Palestine. The above-mentioned Balfour Declaration was issued in this way.</p>
<p>When Britain accepted the mandate over Palestine, it never issued a very pleasant declaration saying that it would build a national home for the Jews and also maintain a national home for the Arabs, and that it would train the residents of Palestine to gradually become accustomed to the art of self-government. Even if we admit that the ideals of British politicians were honest and sincere, in fact, the two ethnic groups in Palestine, the Arabs and the Jews, were difficult to reconcile. The Jews were stingy and industrious, and the Arabs were generous and lazy. The Arabs hated the Jews for exploiting them, and the Jews looked down on the Arabs.</p>
<p>Therefore, since 1920, when Britain accepted the mandate over Palestine, there has been a series of events of Arab-Jewish conflict. At the same time, Britain itself was either resented by the Jews or angered by the Arabs. In 1924, when Samuel was the High Commissioner, he incurred the attacks of the Arabs for favoring the Jews. In 1929, due to the stimulation of Jewish economic expansion, the Arabs launched a major opposition against the Jews through the Wailing Wall incident in Jerusalem. The British saw that the Arabs were powerful, so they had to appease the Arabs. Therefore, there was also the White Paper report by Colonial Secretary Passfield, saying that he wanted to restrict Jewish immigration. As a result, the Jews were dissatisfied again.</p>
<p>After that, the Arab and Jewish groups have never been reconciled. In the years of 1930 and 1933, the Arab anti-Jewish movement often turned into an anti-British movement. This continued until the eve of the Second World War. Britain proposed a plan to divide Palestine, dividing Palestine into political regions. The northern part was assigned to the Jews, the southern part was assigned to the Arabs, and the area near Jerusalem was assigned to the mandate territory. This plan was not implemented, and the Second World War broke out. Britain had no choice but to rule Palestine with an iron fist, suppressing both the Arabs and the Jews. There has been no news coming out of Palestine in the past three years. This is the reason.</p>
<p>Speaking of those Jews who returned to Palestine, they are indeed capable. They have invested a large amount of capital here and are engaged in agriculture. They have been wandering for too long and want to settle down here and really turn Palestine into a "land of milk and honey" as Moses said. They develop potassium in the Dead Sea and use the hydroelectric power of the Jordan River for power generation. In the coastal area, near Jaffa, they built a new city that is inhabited by 50,000 Jews. They named this city the Mountain of Hope (Tel Aviv).</p>
<p>The minds and financial resources of the Jews are developing there day by day, which makes it very possible to exclude the Arabs. The Arabs hate the Jews from the bottom of their hearts. They say that Palestine is theirs and that most of the people in Palestine are theirs. They outnumber the Jews by six to one. They are also dissatisfied with British rule. They say that in the Turkish Empire era, they only contributed 180,000 pounds to the Sultan, but they have to contribute 500,000 pounds to Britain. Therefore, the Arabs have changed from anti-Jewish to anti-British. In 1933, when the British completed the oil pipeline from Iraq to Haifa, the Arabs launched a major riot, and the British used great pressure to suppress it.</p>
<p>Let's talk about Transjordan</p>
<p>The political areas of the Crescent Area—Iraq, Syria, Palestine, and Transjordan—are all the home of the Arabs. Among the Arabs in these four regions, Palestine and Syria are the most restless in the eyes of the British and French. Iraq is behaving well and Transjordan is the most obedient. The British indeed made a brilliant move by placing a Transjordanian here. The position of Transjordan is between Iraq, Palestine, and Saudi Arabia. It can be a central point of contact for the Arabs, and it can also be an obstacle to Arab unity. Because the King of Transjordan is very obedient, it hinders the connection and unity of the Arabs. When Palestine and the Arabs rise up against the Jews and the British, they cannot hope for the help of their tribesmen in the desert. When the British were arranging the rule of Palestine, they separately designated Transjordan as a mandated territory, with Abdullah, the second son of Hussein, the former administrator of Mecca, as king. The British used all kinds of modern pleasures to win over this mediocre king—giving him airplanes and cars. In Transjordan, the British did not bring in Jews to live, but the British advisers became Abdullah's [illegible].</p>
<p>Transjordan extends east from the line of the Sea of ​​Galilee, the Jordan River, and the Dead Sea, and accumulates to one thousand square miles, with a population of 240,000. Most of the territory is desert, and the capital, Amman, has a highway from Jerusalem. The British have an air force stationed there.</p>
<h3 id="e29">From the 22nd, the Public Concession will Implement Grain Rationing Based on Population; First Step is Issuing Four-Part Rice Coupons, with Formal Distribution of Rice Based on Household Registration Starting July 1st <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The preparations for grain rationing in the Public Concession are gradually nearing completion and have been scheduled to begin on the 22nd of this month. The first step in implementation is the issuance of rice coupons. These coupons are divided into four parts, one part for each week, and are all given to the head of the household. Each part can be used on a designated day of each week at a nearby rice shop to purchase the weekly rice needs for the head of the household's family, as well as any attached households and their families. The rationing standard will be based entirely on the household registration records.</p>
<p>Increase of 657 Rice Shops</p>
<p>According to a report by a Datong News Agency reporter, the number of rice shops in the two concessions will be increased starting on the 22nd of this month, with 414 in the Public Concession and 243 in the French Concession. The number of rice shops has been completely finalized. The purpose of increasing the number of rice shops is to facilitate the implementation of grain rationing. The Municipal Council's Rice Management Committee has also decided to start delivering rice coupons to the ward (保甲) departments on the 22nd of this month for distribution to the heads of households within the Public Concession. It is expected that these rice coupons will be distributed within nine days, and all heads of households should complete the process by the end of this month at the latest.</p>
<p>Rice Shops Must Display Wooden Signs</p>
<p>With this, the first step of issuing rice coupons will be completed, and the second step of grain rationing will be implemented. Starting July 1st, all 657 rice shops in the two concessions must display a white-background, black-letter wooden sign in front of their stores, stating "Shanghai Public Concession Registered Rice Retailer, Number [口號]." The size of these signs is stipulated to be two square English feet. The purpose of setting up these signs is to make it easier for those purchasing rationed rice to verify the registration number of the designated rice shop on their rice coupons.</p>
<p>Formal Rationing Starts July 1st</p>
<p>Starting July 1st, heads of households can use their rice coupons to collect the total weekly rice ration for themselves and their attached households from the designated nearby rice shops. According to investigations, in the most densely populated areas of the Central District, each rice shop can receive up to 11,000 rice coupons based on the situation in the last six months. In other less densely populated areas, they can receive 7,000 rice coupons. Therefore, the implementation of this abundant method will prevent rice shops from being unable to cope with the demand.</p>
<p>Rice Management Committee Notifies Rice Shops</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of rice shops preparing wooden signs, the Municipal Council's Rice Management Committee yesterday issued a notice to all rice shops, stating: "To all registered rice shops, starting July 1st, please prepare a white-painted wooden sign in a prominent location on your premises. The minimum size should be two square English feet, and the sign should be inscribed in black paint according to the following format (detailed in the previous text) with your registered number. Failure to comply with this notice will be considered a violation of the agreement between your shop and this office regarding the retail sale of rice. Please take note.

<h3 id="e31">The Darling of the Times: A New Look for the Insurance Industry <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Zijian</p>
<p>Recently, anyone who has paid even a little attention to the newspapers knows that many newly established Chinese-owned insurance companies have been founded one after another, reflecting the special development and prosperity of the insurance business. These many new insurance companies that have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a rain are truly the darlings of this era!</p>
<p>In China, the insurance business used to be dominated by British and American insurance companies, which had deep roots and long histories. Companies like American Asiatic Underwriters, North America, and San Francisco of the American companies, and Four Seas and Paler of the British companies were not only financially strong but also large in scale and had a wide reach.</p>
<p>However, since the outbreak of the Pacific War on December 8th of last year, more than 60 British and American insurance companies and agencies have been affected and have ceased operations. On January 26th of this year, the Japanese side announced that it would dispatch supervisors to liquidate the main 23 of them (20 engaged in property and fire insurance, and 3 in life insurance). This turning point has given Chinese insurance companies a great opportunity to prosper. This evolution has led to the current flourishing scene of the emerging insurance industry.</p>
<p>According to surveys, the newly established companies that have recently joined the Fire Insurance Trade Association include Taian, Daan, Danan, Daye, Feng, and Dadong. Companies that have applied for membership include Huatai, Xinfeng, Guohua, and Daxin. Companies that are currently in preparation include Limin, Dachina, and China Industrial. The amount of capital ranges from 100,000 to 10 million yuan. In total, including the original Chinese insurance companies, there are now over 40 companies. This not only symbolizes the special development of the Chinese insurance industry but also breaks the historical record of the Chinese insurance business.</p>
<p>Currently, the organization of new insurance companies is mostly based on joint-stock companies that aim to obtain business profits. The qualifications for general profit-making organizations vary from country to country. For example, in France, life insurance companies must be joint-stock or limited partnership companies. In Germany, life, accident, wind power, and other insurance companies must be joint-stock organizations, while others are not required. In Japan, only joint-stock companies are allowed, while the UK does not impose any restrictions. Joint-stock organizations and mutual organizations each have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the main thing is to decide based on the circumstances. Their creation depends on the actual social situation and needs. The establishment of these many new joint-stock companies is, of course, also the product of the times.</p>
<p>Currently, the most developed trend in the insurance industry is property insurance.</p>
<p>Property insurance is insurance that takes the loss or damage of property as a prerequisite for concluding an insurance contract. Recently, the situation of various businesses has also changed greatly:</p>
<p>Marine insurance, also known as water insurance, is an insurance contract that aims to guarantee the damage and expenses suffered by the insured object due to all maritime events and changes. Those belonging to ships are ship insurance, those belonging to goods are cargo insurance, those belonging to freight are freight insurance, and those belonging to profits are profit insurance. Before the war, the ships on the routes between this port and Europe, America, Southeast Asia, the coastal areas, and the Yangtze River were frequent, and water insurance was also unusually developed. After August 13th, coastal and Yangtze River shipping were first hit, and then the outbreak of the European War deeply affected the Shanghai-Europe shipping. Later, the flames of war spread to the Far East, and the Shanghai-America, Shanghai-Hong Kong, and Southeast Asia shipping were also suspended, causing water insurance business to be hit repeatedly and falling into a slump. Currently, the number of ships entering and leaving the port is not even one or two-tenths of what it was before the war, and the sea is not peaceful, and war permeates the area. The safety of sea voyages has lost its guarantee, so insurers are mostly afraid to get involved, and the business is visibly slow.</p>
<p>Fire insurance, also known as fire insurance, is insurance that aims to compensate for the damage caused to the insured object by fire. It can be divided into two types: movable property (such as goods, machinery, equipment and decoration, clothes and luggage, etc.) and houses (including various buildings). After Shanghai formed an isolated island, the population increased dramatically, and the development was abnormal. The amount of goods stockpiled was especially large (estimated at about 200 million yuan), so fire insurance followed suit and developed, becoming the main target of business for insurance companies today.</p>
<p>Other types of insurance include transportation insurance, automobile insurance, theft insurance, boiler insurance, glass insurance, and elevator insurance. Among them, automobile insurance was once popular, but because gasoline is currently severely restricted, the number of cars has decreased sharply, and the impact has been a sharp decline.</p>
<p>As for personal insurance and intangible benefits insurance, the amount is much less than that of property insurance!</p>
<p>The income of an insurance company comes from the premiums paid by the insured and the profits from the company's investments. Its expenditures are the compensation for losses and the operating expenses. When income exceeds expenditures, the surplus is used for (1) providing compensation for accidental losses and (2) supplementing the company's dividends. Currently, insurance companies make various investments with their funds, mainly in: real estate; securities such as government bonds and stocks; mortgage loans; cash; property rental income; and other industries.</p>
<p>Bicycle insurance is experiencing prosperity and decline in the opposite way to automobile insurance. Several insurance companies are now starting to operate new insurance businesses! The procedure for ordinary bicycle insurance is that the owner fills out an application form, brings the original bicycle to the insurance company for inspection by an inspector, and then completes the insurance procedure. The contents of the application form are roughly divided into: the detailed form of the bicycle, such as style, brand, structure, price, characteristics, etc.; whether the wheels are in use or storage; whether the vehicle is for private use; whether the use of the vehicle is for professional or vocational needs; whether anyone other than the owner uses it. (Ages under 18 and over 60 must be indicated.) Whether the insured vehicle has been involved in accidents before.</p>
<p>The scope of insurance damage includes: damage (such as injuries or damage caused by collisions); fire insurance (including damage caused by fire or explosion); theft (all thefts from residences, public parking lots, or offices are included in this category); riding damage, all injuries or deaths caused to others (including animals) by the owner while riding are eligible for compensation.</p>
<p>Regarding insurance rates, various types differ from each other, and the main thing is to decide based on the condition of the vehicle. According to the rates of a famous insurance company in this port, the average maximum annual rate is about 1.33%. For example, if the insured amount is 10,000 yuan, the insurance premium is 750 yuan. In the current era of many bicycle accidents, this rate cannot be considered too expensive!</p>
<p>If we say that the emerging insurance business is the darling of the times, then bicycle insurance is the darling of these darlings!</p>
<h3 id="e32">Hands to Shake, Sleepless Eyes, Lion Faces, Cracked Ulcers... Real-Life Photos of Lepers <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Liang</p>
<p>Doing Their Best to Survive, Courage Still Abounds, the Spirit of Helping Others and Friendship Prevails</p>
<p>The second type is neurological. At the beginning, there is a feeling of discomfort, soreness, and there are also cases with no symptoms at all. Later, the local skin turns grayish-white, the discolored area becomes numb, the muscles atrophy, the nerves become paralyzed, the fingers become claw-like, and the eyes cannot be closed due to nerve paralysis. Even when sleeping, the eyes are open, becoming "sleepless eyes." There is also a mixed type that has both skin and nerve characteristics.</p>
<p>Leprosy is terrible, but it is not an incurable disease. As long as patients do not hide their illness and avoid treatment, and seek treatment as soon as possible, there is absolutely no danger. There are several people in the leprosy hospital who are almost indistinguishable from ordinary people because they sought treatment as soon as the disease appeared. The method of preventing leprosy is to isolate yourself from patients and focus on nutrition to strengthen resistance. If someone develops red spots or skin discoloration, you can use a needle to prick the area with spots or discoloration. If you don't feel pain, you may have leprosy and should seek a medical diagnosis as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The organizer of the Chinese Leprosy Hospital is the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association at 53, Lane 612, Jing'an Temple Road. According to the association's estimates, there are about one million lepers in various parts of China, and there are more than 40 leprosy clinics across the country. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the source of funding has been severely hit, and foreign donations have been cut off. However, the cost of about 200 yuan per month for each leper has increased rather than decreased, so it has been decided to hold a 150,000 yuan fundraising campaign from the 16th of this month to raise funds for maintenance.</p>
<p>Leprosy is an individual's disease, but preventing the spread of leprosy is a social task, a social responsibility. No wonder the people in the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association say that they hope "enthusiastic ladies and gentlemen in the community will generously donate." (End of article)</p>

<p>The free entrance examination for middle school students established by the Chinese Education Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council to subsidize poor youth and reward outstanding students was completed yesterday at Xinzha Elementary School on Xinzha Road. According to the reporter in charge of the office, although the number of students taking the exam this time was small, the results were all excellent, surpassing those of previous sessions. As for the date of the announcement, it will be necessary to wait for one week. It is said that in addition to being disclosed in newspapers, the candidates who are admitted will be notified separately by the examiner, and the schools that recommend them for the exam (those who are not admitted will no longer be notified by letter). As for the students, it has been decided not to notify them separately by letter, so all students who take the exam and want to know the results of the exam can directly ask the school.</p>

<p>As summer approaches and the climate gradually warms, according to usual practice, the parks in the British and French concessions are both open until 10:30 PM. However, visitors to Bund Park mostly stroll around after dinner because it is close to the Bund and the ocean breeze is cooler in the evening. However, recently, other parks have extended their visiting hours one after another, but Bund Park still closes at 8:00 PM every day.</p>

<h3 id="e36">French Concession Authorities Strictly Prohibit Raising Prices and Dispatch Personnel to Conduct Strict Inspections; Violators Will Be Severely Punished <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>The cost of living in Shanghai has skyrocketed, and recently it has been rising extremely wildly. Although the authorities have paid attention to and tried their best to stop it, merchants have devised many clever tricks, making it difficult for market prices to fall back. Recently, at the time of the transition between the old and new monetary systems, most stores took the opportunity to secretly raise prices. The citizens are living in dire straits and complaining endlessly. The French Concession authorities, in view of this, believe that merchants' secret price increases not only affect the lives of citizens but also hinder the entire market. In addition to strictly evaluating the market prices of various goods, they have also dispatched personnel to go out and conduct secret inspections in various vegetable markets and stores. If they find any violations of the evaluated prices or private price increases, they will be severely punished in order to stabilize prices and relieve the people's suffering. The general public is overjoyed to hear this.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Zhu Brothers Abuse Stepmother; A Scene of Martial Drama at Hualong Hospital <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>At about 2:30 PM on the 12th of this month, a commotion suddenly broke out in the accounting room on the ground floor of Hualong Hospital at the intersection of Route Belleserre and Avenue Messimy in the French Concession. The atmosphere was tense. At that time, a certain Mr. [某君] in the hospital's accounting room was beaten and bled from the face, and several tea boys were also beaten. The patients who were staying in the hospital for treatment were panicked. Patients in serious condition were greatly stimulated mentally, and their conditions worsened. According to the patients in the hospital, two Zhu brothers led a group of people into the hospital with the intention of taking action against their stepmother, who was staying in the hospital for treatment. Because the Zhu brothers have always been at odds with their stepmother and often abused her. At that time, the two brothers used the excuse of visiting the patient, but they had other intentions. Since their stepmother was out getting an injection at a Western doctor's office, the Zhu brothers wanted to enter the ward to visit, but they were repeatedly stopped by the hospital manager. The two brothers did not ask for the reason and started beating people, causing the patients in the hospital to be frightened. In recent years, there have been many cases of abuse of direct relatives in Shanghai. The most prominent examples are the Zhou brothers who were hanged on the 10th of this month for murdering their biological father, and a certain son on Route Cardinal Mercier who hammered his biological father to death with an iron dumbbell. Such acts are not tolerated by the law. As a result, the unfilial sons were all sentenced to death. Now there is another incident of Zhu brothers abusing their stepmother, which is regrettable. Young people who have received considerable education and come from noble families are so disobedient to their elders, despise the law, and disregard morality. If this continues to escalate, they will definitely suffer the consequences.</p>

<p>A Suzhou woman surnamed Wang and surnamed Yu, about 40 years old, bought several taels of opium from an opium dealer in Nine Acres Place the day before yesterday afternoon. She hid it on her body and planned to transport it into the concession for sale. When she passed the iron gate of Dongxinqiao in the French Concession, she was stopped and searched by the female search team stationed there. The opium was confiscated, and she was taken to the police station. According to her confession, she bought it to cook and smoke at home and denied selling it. The police chief ordered her to be detained pending investigation and prosecution according to law.</p>

<p>Gu Xiuying, a 19-year-old local woman living at 412 Tokyo Road, was slightly attractive and was bewitched by Zhong Yuan, a Jiangbei woman, who lived next door. She falsely claimed that a factory at 103 Route Frelupt was recruiting female workers, and those with fashionable looks could earn 300 yuan a month. The young and ignorant girl believed it and discussed it with her mother, who agreed to let her go. Seeing that she had been trapped, Zhong claimed that according to the factory's regulations, a contract had to be signed first, otherwise the goal could not be achieved. She also asked the girl to get a perm, dress fashionably, and apply nail polish and powder, and gave her 140 yuan in legal tender as a settlement allowance. Both Gu and her mother followed her instructions. At 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, Zhong and Luo Liu, a Jiangbei woman surnamed Wu Qianzhang, accompanied Gu to the place, and then they took the opportunity to escape one after another. Gu realized that the place was not a factory but a private brothel. After a while, she secretly ran home and told her mother, and reported it to the Gordon Road Police Station. Detective Bai Wenqi was dispatched to arrest Zhong Yuan, Luo Liu, and Wu Qianzhang. He also went to the brothel at 103 Route Frelupt for investigation and confirmed that Xue Landi, a 19-year-old Jiangbei woman who was lured there by Zhong and others to engage in flesh trade last winter, was also taken to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to court on charges of kidnapping decent women into prostitution and requested detention pending further investigation.</p>

<p>According to the Domei News Agency, the Japanese military police in Shanghai have, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident, protected under local institutions in the concession, engaged in anti-Japanese espionage and propagandist strategems for the leaders of the Shanghai media circles. They have, since December of last year until March of this year, separately apprehended and detained Millers Review journalist Miss Beryl Powell (55 years old), journalist for the China Press (大美晚報) Ober (30 years old), editor and critic for the Far Eastern Review Woodhead (58 years old), and more than ten people related to the case. Based on numerous documentary evidence and other clues, after a thorough investigation, the truth about anti-Japanese espionage and propaganda strategems has been revealed. The aforementioned three main figures have been handed over to a military tribunal for interrogation on charges of espionage and disturbing the peace. It has been discovered that their reports to their home countries have not only been used as important data for their home countries' policy decisions on Japan, but their espionage and propaganda have also exacerbated Japan's international environment, and it can be asserted that the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War was actually caused by them. The experiences and activities of the individuals involved in this case are as follows (to be continued).</p>

<p>— Qian Ding</p>
<p>(II) Meeting an Old Friend in a Foreign Land</p>
<p>In the twelfth month of the sixteenth year, I held a painting exhibition in Harbin and engaged in some social interactions. Then, I took the Chinese Eastern Railway train, crossed the Greater Khingan Range, and arrived at Manchuria Station. Along the way, I only saw a vast expanse of ice and snow, a completely cool world. Due to the extreme cold, I couldn't go out for sightseeing or sketching. I could only read books or create traditional Chinese paintings to pass the time in the hotel. After staying here for several days, I felt lonely and planned to leave immediately. In the morning, I wrote several letters first. Just as I was about to send them, I suddenly remembered that two years ago, I had received a letter from my friend Mr. Dong from Manchuria Station in Beiping, informing me that he was working at the Railway Bureau here. Therefore, I immediately tried sending a letter to him. At noon, someone came to inquire and pushed open my room door. It was indeed Mr. Dong! We shook hands tightly, overjoyed to see each other. In this cold frontier, living as a lonely traveler, I suddenly encountered an old friend from afar, meeting a familiar face in a foreign land. My heart was filled with immense joy! Mr. Dong felt the same way. He thought I was passing through here on my way to Russia. He didn't expect that I had come to sketch, braving the cold and snow on a long journey. He wanted me to stay here for a few more days to have a good chat. Meeting Mr. Dong here was indeed rare, and I enjoyed the opportunity to catch up. He lived with a Russian colleague's family, so I painted an oil portrait of a bearded Russian man. This colleague was a descendant of an old Russian aristocrat who had come to this place after the revolution and had many children. There were two girls, about fourteen or fifteen years old, lively and lovely, always diligent and hardworking. Every day after returning from school, they would help their mother cook, tidy up the house, and scrub the floor barefoot. In the evening, they would do their homework with their younger siblings under the lamp. I found it very interesting to see so many children studying under the lamp, or asking and answering questions with each other. I quickly sketched a few portraits in pencil on the side, which they all asked for. Mr. Dong's small room was quiet and clean, with various landscape photos he had taken himself hanging on the wall, as well as a photo of him and his lover playing in Zhongshan Park in Beiping. He pointed to the photo and said that he had to send her a letter every day, and he openly showed me her short notes. This woman was full of literary talent, with beautiful handwriting, which was a pleasure to read. After showing it to me, he often sighed and said, "What should I do?" Mr. Dong was a passionate, humorous, and lively young man. When he talked about how to achieve a perfect result, he couldn't help but reveal a serious expression and said, "What should I do?" His expression seemed somewhat distressed, as if he wanted to discuss it with me. I said to him, "Wait until she graduates from college, and you will naturally get a perfect result." Afterwards, he talked about the border conflict between China and Russia. After the peaceful resolution, he picked up an empty artillery shell containing candy sent by a foreigner to his lover. Unexpectedly, when it was sent to Beiping, it was during a period of strict security checks. The military police inspected the package and found this heavy and suspicious object. Upon opening it, they were shocked to find a large artillery shell filled with beautiful candy. The military police didn't dare to try it, thinking there might be some trickery inside. They checked the address on the package and interrogated the recipient of this suspicious package, and searched her house, frightening everyone. Later, after explaining the situation, everything was cleared up. He told me many funny stories, which I found very interesting. Every day after work, he would come to my lodging to chat and laugh, or have a small drink, or go out to photograph in the snow, or invite me to his landlord's house to taste Russian home-cooked meals, or attend a dance party at the Russian club in the evening. However, Mr. Dong didn't like dancing and would sit there dozing off, while I would set up a fortune-telling stall, just for fun, and watch the excitement. Sometimes, the hotel manager would come to my room to talk about local customs, such as how local people hunted marmots in the wild, or how they caught carp by cutting ice in Lake Dalai, which were all very interesting to hear. This rich and interesting life passed quickly for more than thirty days, and I decided on a date to leave this desolate place. That night, he saw me off on the train. In the lonely and clear scene, at the moment the train moved, we quietly said goodbye.</p>
<p>After leaving Harbin, I went straight to the desolate frontier. In this lonely journey, I suddenly met Mr. Dong, which led to a rich and interesting life. Mr. Dong, in the golden age of love, had a lot of joy and also a lot of distress. After I returned to Beiping from my trip, he also achieved his ideal perfect result. Now, recalling the scene from fourteen or fifteen years ago, it is still vivid in my mind. Life is like an illusion. All the efforts, struggles, joys, sorrows, safety, and danger, all the various situations, are actually driven by a kind of love. Therefore, I feel that the existence and prosperity of all life originate from love, flourish with beauty, and grow with truth and goodness. Since the evolution of human life and the prosperity of civilization, such as Jesus's universal love to save the world, Sakyamuni's attainment of good fruits, compassion, Confucius and Mencius's emphasis on benevolence and righteousness, clarifying human relations, Lao Zhuang's advocacy of nature, morality, Yangming's pursuit of the unity of knowledge and action, scholars' understanding of principles and seeking truth, artists' aesthetic appreciation and art activities, patriots' love of country and governance, men and women's marriage for love, parents' upbringing of children, brothers' close relationship like hands and feet, and friends' mutual assistance in morality, all are based on love as the original cause, and all flourish and grow in love. To explore the origin of love can be summarized into three: God, matter, and spirit. God is metaphysical, eternally unchanging; matter is physical, changing at any time; the spirit is in the middle, living appropriately. I remember what a person from Mount Qian said, "To make essence and energy rise upward to obtain its spirit, but to be burdened by desires, the spirit will wither." The meaning is that if a person's spirit is burdened by desires and withers, then matter cannot exist. At this point, there is no true love, and there is no life. Therefore, any human group, if it is filled with greed and the habit of seeking temporary peace, does not know how to live appropriately to seek the existence of true love, the existence of ambition and interest, then it will never see prosperity and growth, or even face the tragic fate of being on the verge of withering. From this, we can know that all aspects of our lives should seek to develop the source of true love every day, not to restrain or exhaust it, so that the garden of life does not lose its irrigation and dry up. I also think that fifteen years ago, in a desolate and lonely situation, I actually gained a rich and interesting life. Therefore, I also know that Mr. Dong, in the joys and sorrows of true love, and in the efforts of life, finally achieved a perfect result. It seems that there is a natural true God who is protecting us, tempering us, and perfecting us. From this, we can know that God helps those who help themselves. Only when we can realize ourselves and work hard, can we turn danger into safety. Although we are now living in a prosperous city, it is actually more difficult than living in a desolate and lonely environment. But how can we still obtain a rich and interesting life, how can we still obtain a life of true love and happiness? This still requires us to be aware and work hard, not to be vain, not to be confused. I think the true God of nature will come in time to fulfill everything.</p>

<p>The Guo Bin Cup Round Gate Ball League competition kicked off yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Guangxia Middle School on Moore Road. Spectators who came to watch reached several thousands, breaking the previous record for the Guangxia Middle School ball field.</p>
<p>Southern Film Queen</p>
<p>Ms. Li Qinian attended the event and performed the ball-handling ceremony. As a result, the women's performance of rattling bells relied on the average talent and defeated the Central China Team A, composed of patriotic movie stars, by a small margin of two to one. Due to being surrounded by the audience, their strength was greatly reduced and lost to South China by a score of one to three. The Nanyang mixed team played fiercely and could not be separated, and finally drew with Central China with three goals each.</p>
<p>Women Take the Field</p>
<p>Zhang Bihua of the Rattling Bells team was the first to score. Wang Weizhen of the Patriotism team was not willing to be outdone and scored a goal with great difficulty. In the first half, each team had a tie. In the second match, the ladies from both teams each went their own way. At the seventh minute, Wei Peihui of the Rattling Bells team had a delicate hand and scored a goal in the right corner, thus setting the victory and defeating the Patriotism team by a score of two to one. In the first men's performance, as soon as both sides made contact, the China United Team A, under the cheers of thousands of</p>
<p>Viewers Celebrated</p>
<p>and with the assistance of Shu Shi and De Mei Xi, opened the record first. The generals of South China came to invade, and when He Jinkui started, the ball had already entered the net. Fan Jinyong, the goalkeeper of the Central China team, was caught off guard and announced the loss of the city. Halfway through the game, the audience was too crowded, and the major stars were surrounded. In the situation where it was impossible to continue the competition, the</p>
<p>Star Players</p>
<p>turned to retirement to prepare for replenishment. The huge waves began to calm down, and Liu Fuqiang of South China took the opportunity to try to recover. At that time, with momentum, the plum blossoms were second, and South China defeated the United Team A by two to one. The mixed Nanyang conference battle began. Han Longhai of Nanyang gave a small test of his abilities and scored a goal in the chaotic situation first. In less than two minutes, Han Longhai followed the same pattern and scored again. The mixed battle line,</p>
<p>Enemy Cavalry Raged</p>
<p>In 20 minutes, Ma Canxi of the mixed team returned the favor. In the first half, Nanyang led by two to one. After choosing a place to fight again, the mixed team desperately counterattacked, and Zhang Shaoqing rode alone to build a monument and return. After three times of entanglement, Li Yao of Nanyang cleverly used the empty-heart plan to win back a goal. Seeing that the situation was not good, Zhang Shaoqing of the mixed team saw injustice and helped with a knife. The two sides each tied at three goals to form a tie. The list of yesterday's game continuation is as follows:</p>

<p>Economic Special Issue, No. 418</p>
<p>Weekly Market Commentary</p>
<p>The past ten-plus days seem specially designed for the continuous rise in prices; the suffering of the people's livelihood oppressed by high prices is the same as the invisible erosion of savings due to high prices. Then, after this financial change, should there be another step?</p>
<p>Now, the talk of managing prices and cracking down on speculation is rampant. What will happen in the end? Let's wait for the facts to prove it. But everything is inseparable from the facts. For example, in addition to speculation, there are fundamental factors in supply and demand that cause high prices. But it can be said that if speculation can be eliminated, it will greatly contribute to dispersing the population of this city. Reducing the population is also a way to adjust supply and demand, isn't it?</p>
<p>Retreating to discuss the continuous surge in prices is always related to the quantity of currency in circulation. The intensity of such a continuous surge today is rare even during periods of currency inflation. However, now is the period when savings are being used to recover legal tender at a rate of two to one, which can be said to be in the process of currency contraction. Why does this opposite phenomenon occur? Because banks have stopped accepting legal tender cash deposits, they are circulating between commodity transactions and securities transactions; and extending the process of currency-to-currency exchange invisibly, the contraction rate is offset by the circulation rate.</p>
<p>The higher the currency circulation, the tighter the need for currency. In addition, it is close to the Dragon Boat Festival, so the money market in this city is not relaxed due to currency congestion. Last week, the interbank lending rate of money shops increased from 1.5 cents to 1.7 cents. Although the increase was slight, the attitude was still tight. This is another contradiction.</p>
<p>If hot money withdraws from commodity speculation, where will it go in the future? It is quite interesting. Chinese stocks have already risen, but it is driven by the stimulus of prices. If this factor is lost, then it must wait for a new standard to be discovered before it is possible.</p>
<p>The booming real estate in recent years is one of the reasons for the concentration of population; the excess of hot money is also one of the reasons. The decline in currency value is another reason. How will the objective situation change in the future? The relationship is very important. But when things reach an extreme, they will turn around, and a narrow road can be met. Is this another contradiction with the image of population dispersion?</p>
<h3 id="e46">Market Dynamics <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Government Bonds</p>
<p>Last week, the bond market trend can be described as soaring. Most bonds rose by about ten yuan. Although there were many profit-taking in the middle, the stage remained solid. The lineup on both sides was largely the same as the previous week; however, there were more people taking profits than the previous week. Tongshun, Defu, Hu Heji, and Tongkang are the leaders in this regard. Tongli was still the leader in the continuous decline, but at the beginning of the week, Tongli had mutual entry and exit, which seemed to have shaken its confidence; but looking at its subsequent continuous decline, we can know that it was caused by skills. Those with strong absorption stomachs include Qianyi, Shuntai, Lianhe, Tongyuan, and Changji, etc. The scattered many are also worth noting. The limit up on Thursday was a pioneering initiative after the change of currency units, and its significance is certainly not comparable to ordinary times. The slight return wind on the weekend is also an important embellishment. But the direction of this week is very important. If it is still and still for observation, then the future has great potential.</p>
<p>Foreign Currency</p>
<p>The foreign currency market has been regarded as unpopular. Precisely because of this, it will not be let go. The performance is amazing. Last week, the US dollar pound was close to the 600 yuan mark. The US dollar bill tracked even faster; speaking of the degree: the pound's rise was greater than the gold bill in the previous week; the gold bill's advance last week was faster than the gold pound.</p>
<p>The foothold of the Japanese military ticket is still hard, but the stability of the listing has attracted attention so far. Mid-month is often the peak period of military tickets. What is the current situation? Very interesting.</p>
<p>The trend of Hong Kong tickets is step by step, very tightly tied; the sudden storm on Thursday, the rising momentum is fierce, how can it be the result of steady and steady fighting.</p>
<p>The market price of Chinese stocks was particularly brilliant last week. The continuous surge has not only dispelled the halved impact of changing to the use of savings notes, but has also exceeded the one-to-one ratio and continued to rise sharply. This is the result of the general price increase, which is not surprising. If the price continues to rise, the future of the stock market is unlimited, isn't it also a logical prediction?</p>
<p>At the turn of the semester, cultural stocks are of course popular, with Commercial Press taking the lead, and Zhonghua and World also tracking straight up. Textile stocks follow closely with cloth, never letting go. The pillar of the market, the new medicine stocks, such as New Asia and Sino-French, are both flourishing; for Wuzhou Pharmacy, there are only calls to buy, no calls to sell. It can be described as a rare commodity to be cherished. China Underwear was initially up and then tired, showing a unique feature.</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a popular saying in the market about cracking down on speculation. Once it is realized, the scope of speculation will become narrower, and the only place that can accommodate hot money at that time is probably the Chinese stock market?</p>
<p>Foreign Stocks</p>
<p>Last week, the market price of foreign stocks was stimulated by the crazy rise of Chinese stocks, and they also fought ten times: the intensity of the storm was comparable. Chinese stocks soared in the two days of Tuesday and Wednesday, and foreign stocks soared on Thursday. The rising wind of Chinese stocks continued to be strong, and the rise of foreign stocks stopped as soon as it rose; it can be seen that it has become a bubble nature. Jardine Matheson, which has always been the leader of foreign stocks, has been gloomy recently, and it has returned to youth last week. The lowest price on Wednesday was only 69.5 yuan, and the next day it reached 84.5 yuan, but it quickly returned to 72 yuan on Friday: it is really like a dying old man. Textile foreign stocks do not let China Textiles; rubber stocks are rising in an orderly manner; industrial stocks have mixed fortunes; real estate stocks are moderately sharp. Public utilities stocks are advancing unparalleled, as the head of all stocks. This is a by-product of price increase and changing to the use of standby notes. However, the saying of rectifying the market is now raging; if it is true, foreign stocks may be difficult to escape?</p>
<p>Commodities</p>
<p>Cigarette Market: The prices of all cigarette grades have risen in unison; the intensity of the sharpness is not inferior due to the mold season: it is really rare in history. The market rumored that there was no way to ship the goods, and the factory price was about to increase. In fact, it is using the merger of Japanese cigarette factories. Suspending the distribution of goods and forcibly raising the market price. Moreover, the cigarette market still uses legal tender transactions, and the change of currency units is very common, and speculators will certainly not miss the opportunity. However, the cigarette industry in this city has been controlled. It is not comparable to other free commodities. Recently, the seven major Japanese cigarette factories in Central China (Dongyang, Wuhan Huasheng, Gongcheng, Xingya, Dongya, North China Dongya, Sino-Foreign Industry. The Zhonghua Tobacco Co., Ltd. established by the merger has been established, with capital increased to 31.7 million yuan and owning ten factories (seven in Shanghai and two in Hankou). The annual production capacity has increased to 1.3 million cigarettes, and the future can be imagined. Today's price increase may have two effects: one is to prepare for the 2:1 change to savings note transactions so that it will not lag behind other goods, and the other is that the new company is about to open. When new goods are released, the exit of the households' inventory will be poor, especially in this mold season, why not let me have a good opportunity to sell? Then today's various signs are obviously wanting to let go first and then capture, and it is a scene of capturing and releasing Cao before the new metabolism.</p>
<p>Western Medicine: Western medicine transactions use both new and old currencies, and the prices vary, and the general trend is upward, which is slower than other goods. It is good that the customer sales are on the sidelines, and the regular operators are strictly guarding against the activities of the hoarders; therefore, the market atmosphere is the most normal; in the sound of skyrocketing prices of hundreds of things, only Western medicine is the mainstay, which is really commendable.</p>
<p>Grains: Beans and wheat are listed as prosperous, but the arrival of goods is not smooth, so broad beans are tight and the market is tight, about 20 yuan more than the previous week. The rising trend of soybeans is similar; wheat bran is short of goods and the price is firm; new wheat is like a dragon seeing its head but not its tail, which is caused by strict control. There are about 100 bags of transactions in Wuhu every day, and there are also many shipments in Kunshan; the selling price is about 230 yuan per stone. Although the bottom of red beans is thick, the price is still outstanding.</p>
<p>Oil Cakes: Although the price of groundnut and peanut oil in North China has fallen, the price in this city is particularly firm. Starting from Tuesday, the controlled price of retail edible oil has consistently increased by 2 yuan. The cake market transaction is not lonely, and the market atmosphere is mixed, with fluctuations of about 10 yuan throughout the week.</p>
<p>Candles, Soap, and Matches: Candles, soap, and matches have been following the cigarette market; given the high cigarette prices, candles, soap, and matches are difficult to avoid. Hoarders continue to ignore the control, and relentlessly search for high prices. The prosperity of the market is no less than that of the cigarette market.</p>
<p>Cloth</p>
<p>Continuous surge in prices, not enough; opened at the beginning of the week in the control theory, the width is still rising;</p>
<p>Although the existing yarn also follows the factory list sharply, it is not as good as the factory list, and it falls very late, so the rolling is getting farther and farther. The atmosphere of the piece market is not as good as the yarn market. But at the weekend, the popularity was timid, and there was a difference of 120 yuan between the highest and lowest prices of the whole week.</p>

<p>The authorities of the two phases have levied a 2% retail donation. Since it is called a retail donation, wholesale is naturally tax-free. So how to distinguish between retail and wholesale? If it is divided from the nature of the company, it is not a problem for those who specialize in wholesale or retail, but there are many who engage in both wholesale and retail. If it is divided from the total value of the transaction, that is, taxes are levied under a certain number of yuan, and taxes are exempted above that. But the price of goods varies greatly, and the tax-free point must be specified one by one: but the procedure is too complicated; in my opinion, it is better to divide it from the trading volume of each item, that is, taxes are exempted below the purchase of a certain number of similar items; it is easier. If the two are not distinguished, double tax, triple tax and even unlimited tax will inevitably occur, and the increase in prices will be very impressive. However, the essence of the retail donation, in theory, is not a factor in the current price!</p>
<p>The magic hand of the group is likely to extend to the hardware industry. However, this is military supplies; last week, the Liaison Department of the Asian Academy of the Chinese Academy of Sciences issued a metal mobilization order to Japanese nationals on L. Requisition of copper and iron products, all must be submitted before the end of September. The scope of requisition has been specified.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Climate Creates Genius <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— He Kai</p>
<p>The National Academy of Sciences is the most profound scientific research institution in the United States. Its three hundred members meet every two years to discuss the latest discoveries in the scientific community. At the last conference, members heard the startling news that genius is created by climate. The theory was proposed by Professor Peterson of the University of Illinois.</p>
<p>After examining "Who's Who in America," "Dictionary of American Biography," "Who's Who in Germany," and "American Men of Science," Dr. Peterson collected data on 25,000 celebrities. He compared the records of these people with the records of madmen and prisoners.</p>
<p>Their birthdays were said to be irrelevant, but he paid close attention to the approximate dates of their conception.</p>
<p>His statistics show that people conceived in the first half of the year have more unusual minds than others: these people include more geniuses and more madmen.</p>
<p>Applying this rule to 31 American presidents, he found that 16 presidents (including Washington, Lincoln, Wilson, and Roosevelt) were conceived before July. Only five presidents (including Taft, Coolidge, and Hoover) were conceived in October, November, and December.</p>
<p>Dr. Peterson believes that this is neither due to the arrangement of planets as astrologers say, nor is it affected by any mysterious influence; it is just the climate that is at work.</p>
<p>In the Northern Hemisphere, the first half of the year is the storm season, which affects the mother and the fetus, which is most sensitive in the first few weeks of pregnancy. Conception in the relatively calm and storm-free autumn will produce a balanced, normal, and gentle child. And in the spring, it is easy to produce geniuses and abnormal children as well as people prone to mental illness.</p>

<h3 id="e49">Exploring the Secrets of the Deep Sea <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— Star Flower</p>
<p>Decades ago, people generally believed that animals could not survive at all in the deep sea. Later, after many scientists used equipment to collect specimens of deep-sea animals, it was discovered that this was not the case. They found that fish, clams, and crustaceans, and even soft-bodied sea anemones, can live three miles below the surface of the sea.</p>
<p>In the deep sea, sunlight cannot penetrate, yet many animals have eyes. We might guess that they never have the chance to use their eyes from birth to death because in absolute darkness, nothing can be seen. We know that cats can see in the dark because even in the deep of night, there is always some light, and their eyeballs concentrate that light. However, in the completely dark deep sea, such eyes are useless. Fortunately, many fish in the seabed can emit phosphorescence throughout their bodies, with light emanating from the mucus on their skin. Fish are curious, especially about shiny things, so fishermen often tie tin foil to hooks to lure and catch them. Also, some luminescent fish can use their glowing spines, waving them in front of their mouths when hungry to attract small fish nearby, which they then catch and devour. However, these fish are also often eaten by their close relatives—the frogfish (also fish), which specialize in catching fish, and are not easily caught near the surface. When captured, they are immediately dissected, and their stomachs have been found to contain as many as seventy-five herring. Another had swallowed fifteen flounders before its death.</p>
<p>Deep-sea eels can also swallow prey larger than themselves. Their jaws, like those of snakes, are particularly wide, and their throats and bodies are elastic. When brought to the surface, the stomach of the first eel contained a curled-up animal three times its length. The second concealed a victim five times its own weight. Another had eaten so much that it almost dislocated its fins. This world is a world where big fish eat little fish.</p>
<p>Deep-sea animals must endure incredible pressure. We live under air equal in height to the sea, and there is already fifteen pounds of pressure per square inch! Not to mention water. Therefore, even experienced divers cannot reach depths of more than three hundred feet below the surface. Yet fish can withstand this pressure of more than two and a half tons—equivalent to twenty-five times the force of a speeding train. This seems impossible, but there are many animals living on the seabed! This question still awaits a solution. We can answer it this way: because their body tissues are very brittle, it is difficult to move without a large amount of water to support them. Gases are stored or dissolved in their swim bladders and blood, equalizing pressure from all directions. Sometimes, when they rise from their original position, the external pressure decreases, and the internal pressure forces the internal organs towards the mouth, and the eyeballs protrude from their sockets. Their shape becomes different from what it was originally, so they lie on the deep seabed and do not dare to swim upwards.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Friendship <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— Li Quan</p>
<p>The establishment or deepening of friendship often involves shared interests and views, but beyond coordination in life practice, it often cannot maintain lasting friendship. To maintain friendship permanently, like from first love to lifelong commitment, from passionate love to growing old together, deep affection and understanding of life's practice are necessary, and it must be cultivated constantly.</p>
<p>Such cultivation of friendship is no different from cultivating a thriving flower! The most terrible friendship in the world is when friendship is misused and treated as a commodity. You are free to abuse friendship, but friendship is not like dog meat. If we measure friendship with utilitarianism, then it is over, everything is over.</p>
<p>Between each other, can we be frank with each other? Will frankness destroy friendship?</p>
<p>No, it will never happen. Frankness only enhances mutual friendship, but frankness is limited to not harming the dignity of each other's way of life. Everyone should be tolerant of honest criticism from others. The starting point of all criticism comes from truly caring for us, and we have absolutely no reason to refuse it. We should even thank those who criticize us frankly.</p>
<p>However, we must be wary of petty people in the world, who can hinder our courage in work and life. There are also those who, after hearing a slightly unfavorable remark about us from others, generously tell us the truth. These are also disloyal friends and even dangerous. The reason they do this is because of how others told them, and they want to gain self-satisfaction from it.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Indians Who Value Etiquette <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Dong</p>
<p>Indians place great emphasis on etiquette; within this etiquette seems to contain an unexpected element of mystery to us.</p>
<p>For example, when they receive an invitation, the first thing they must do is call the barber from the town where the person who issued the invitation lives to get a haircut. If it is a wedding invitation, the barber must also instruct the invited guest on various necessary rituals.</p>
<p>When the inviter is a noble, the barber must visit each of the invited guests, show them the entire list of guests, and the list must be signed by each person. It can be seen that the barber in India is an indispensable figure in social circles.</p>
<p>Men and women never go to banquets together. They act completely separately.</p>
<p>Women arrive at the venue in vehicles with covered surroundings. Upon arrival, the greeter will loudly announce the arrival of the female guest and lead them into the ladies' room. At this time, it is said to be extremely impolite to call out the woman's name.</p>
<p>Male guests are led into a large living room, where carpets are laid, waiting for the distribution of the feast. The dishes at Indian wedding feasts are always the same. That is a plate of potato soup and bread baked with meat, milk, and cream.</p>
<p>The food is placed on the ground, and everyone squats down to eat.</p>
<p>Whether eating or drinking, they avoid using their left hand. Using the left hand to eat will be seen as barbaric.</p>

<p>(4) Self-Help and Mutual Aid</p>
<p>In these extremely difficult times, the most practical method is self-help and mutual aid. In this atmosphere of hoarding medicine, if you unfortunately fall ill, just the cost of medication is considerable. To avoid this misfortune, it is best to maintain good health. To maintain good health, nothing is more important than diet, daily life, and hygiene. These may seem insignificant, but they actually occupy a major position. If we eat properly and sleep adequately, at least our original resistance will not drop to the point where we cannot prevent diseases. Adequate sleep requires no cost and does not require adding even a drop of water. Although the cost of food has risen considerably, we can save in other areas and not plan on saving on meals, just to avoid getting sick. In the past, only a portion of our income was used for meals, while the rest was for clothing, social activities, entertainment, appearances, and many other items. Now, we have to redistribute the use of our income. By reducing other areas and practicing a frugal lifestyle, we can have more savings on food, which is more protection for our own health.</p>
<p>In addition, the implementation of a proper health insurance system is also necessary for the purpose of self-help and mutual aid. Everyone contributes a very small amount of money within their capacity, which together can become a large sum of money that can be used for the medical expenses of those who unfortunately fall ill. If you don't get sick this year, that is your great fortune. Your small amount of money can be used to help those who unfortunately get sick, so that they don't have to sit and wait for death because of their own financial difficulties. Similarly, if you yourself get sick, you can also enjoy the same rights. We might as well implement this principle. On a small scale, we can gather dozens of families to allocate a certain amount of money for emergency medical use. It's not that you lose out if you don't get sick this month, but that you have helped others. In these times, the most practical strategy is self-help and mutual aid.</p>
<p>Doctors and patients are both striving towards the path of health, from disease to health; but let us go further, which is to prevent disease and maintain health! (End)</p>

<h3 id="e53">Self-Preservation Strategies of Weak Animals <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Jian Nong</p>
<p>Weak animals live in this world, which is a battlefield of the survival of the fittest, where the strong live and the weak die. It's like when we humans encounter a chaotic world. To eke out a living, they must resort to unique skills or clever tactics. In addition to the "camouflage" we talked about before, most of which can be included in this exception, let's pick a few common ones to discuss.</p>
<p>Swift Feet</p>
<p>If a weak animal is unlucky enough to encounter a major enemy, the simplest way to deal with it is to be afraid and stay away—the thirty-six stratagems. Running is the best strategy! As the people of Beiping say: "Sir! You're powerful? I won't mess with you!" But to run, you have to be able to run. Of course, you need a pair of "swift feet" that move like flying clouds and lightning. Look at the wild rabbits that run as fast as an arrow leaving a bow, the zebras that seem to have wings, and the red deer and antelopes that dart through the mountains and leap over streams as easily as walking on flat ground and disappear in the blink of an eye. These are some of the most common examples. If we try to find a few ancient people to compare them to, would it be inappropriate? I think they are somewhat like Guan You'an, who fled to Liaodong to avoid disaster, or Zhu Shunshui, who went into exile overseas.</p>
<p>Freeing Oneself</p>
<p>Locusts or fleas rely on a pair of very strong and powerful spring-like legs to escape. When they see that things are not right, they jump high into the sky, giving you no chance to catch them! This ability to "free oneself" during a moment of extreme danger is somewhat like Han Fengmeng, who resigned from his official position and returned home, or Jin Zhang Han, who abandoned his official post and returned to Wu, isn't it?</p>
<p>High Seclusion</p>
<p>There is a type of sponge called "together in old age, together in the grave"—or Aphrodite's Flower Basket—its shape resembling a bamboo tube, covered with countless columnar and porous ossicles, snow-white in color, like a net woven with silver threads. Because its body structure is inedible for large fish, a loving couple—the shrimp, often live carefree in its hollow cavity. That is the reason it is called "together in old age, together in the grave." I would like to compare this little couple to Liang Hong and Meng Guang, who shared a cart.</p>
<p>Deep Concealment</p>
<p>Earthworms, which eat soil above and drink from the Yellow Springs below, and moles, whose movements are slow and whose eyesight is dim, have no place to use their skills in this world, so they have to retreat and bury their heads deep underground. Even the armadillo, which wears armor and looks quite heroic, uses its front paws, which are sharper than iron shovels, to quickly dig into the ground with a few digs, as if it had the earth-burrowing skills of Sun Shihang! This behavior of deeply concealing oneself to seek self-preservation can also be seen in Shen Tu Pan, who built houses from trees, or Li Erqu, who hid in earthen rooms.</p>
<p>Self-Defilement</p>
<p>Some animals, in order to save their lives, do not hesitate to use the means of "self-defilement" to achieve their goals. For example, mud worms cover their bodies with dung, froghoppers surround themselves with foam, stink bugs emit a foul odor, and many other animals spit out stinky water and release foul gas. They seem to be saying to their pursuers, "I am not edible, I dare not trouble you, please look for other delicacies!" This pitiful means of avoiding disaster cannot help but remind people of Sikong Tu, who lost his composure, and Tang Bohu, who pretended to be mad and naked!</p>

<p>— Shen Xiong</p>
<p>Telephoto photography is a new and emerging novelty, which has been quite developed in recent years, especially in the United Kingdom and the United States. However, news has come that its inventor, Mr. Bowen, has passed away at the young age of thirty-seven. Telephoto photography captures the past activities of people, while telephoto photography allows us to see the activities on the spot, which adds an extra layer of intimacy. Radio can only allow us to hear the sound. With telephoto photography, we can see the person and hear them. The development of science has realized many of the fantasies of years ago. The picture shows the mobile telephoto photography vehicle of the National Broadcasting Company of the United States. The section on the left is where the photographer takes pictures and records sound, and the section on the right is equipped with an antenna to handle the transmission work.</p>

<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>The Sixth Day's Counting</p>
<p>After three or four days, Weicheng counted the days every day, thinking that Sister Cuizhen might be back. Sometimes, when he occasionally thought of Huanglong, he felt that Huanglong was a person who appeared and disappeared unpredictably. He didn't want him to come, but he suddenly came. He hoped he would come, but he simply didn't come. Weicheng's thoughts about Huanglong were only occasional; occasional things faded away after a while. He was in the bedroom, wanting to take a nap, but as soon as he lay down, he felt that a nap was pointless. It wasn't the scorching summer season. He walked to the Shuangmei Study, flipped through a few volumes of ancient poetry, but couldn't read it for more than ten minutes. He went out blankly, seeing dark clouds gathering in the sky, suggesting rain. He thought, that's right, Qingming Festival is coming soon. As the saying goes, it drizzles during the Qingming Festival, probably the heavens are already preparing for Qingming. The spring breeze gently blew up his light gray cloth gown under his feet; at the same time, it blew in from under his trouser legs. He hadn't been in contact with nature for many days, and nature had already changed. In the sun, the wheat leaves were lush and vibrant, completely covering the soil under the stalks. When a gust of wind came, the wheat leaves rose and fell together like waves, flashing the beauty that painters could not paint.</p>
<p>Weicheng temporarily forgot that he was in mourning, strolling along, facing the spring breeze towards the east. He was thinking that if it rained, it would only be a drizzle, a needle-like drizzle, pricking his face, giving him some painless and itchy stimulation, which would be a form of entertainment. As he walked along, he saw Xu Quanfu and He Zixing kneading mud on the boat. This silt, which had settled at the bottom of the river, could be used as fertilizer for enriching the fields when mixed, a method of enrichment passed down from ancient times. Weicheng did not object to using silt as fertilizer. He then asked from the shore, "You two are here, where's Axing?" He Zixing said, "Axing is at the cemetery, Da Taitai's new grave. Last time, the soil wasn't piled up very high. Axing has been making the grave for two days." Weicheng nodded and continued east. He Zixing said, "Young master, it might rain soon, where are you going?" Weicheng didn't turn around, just raised his hand high above his shoulder and waved, indicating that it was okay. (102)</p>
