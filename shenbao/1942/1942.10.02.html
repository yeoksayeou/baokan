<p>紅錫包大鐘一經靜止了將近十個月國際飯店上的天廚味精一也不再睥睨全滬了更想不到七千餘盞的路燈也損失了百分之九十然而上海竟還有籠罩在黑暗中的一天上海人現在正過著奇怪的生活</p>
<p>白天</p>
<p>在咖啡館裹每個人都說著燈火管制在跳舞場裹晚上總沒有人再出來跳舞吧有人這樣說馬路上　車中大家告誡著早早歸家</p>
<p>或許就為了這是奇怪的生活吧在黑布帳幔中的咖啡館裹人們依然呷著吃杯少一杯的咖啡吐出圈圈的煙霧在慘綠的燈光下多富於詩意的情調跳舞場裹洋琴臺上燃亮了蠟炬一魂斷藍橋中的燭光舞正是兩情溶合的媒介曲呢</p>
<p>在金神父路我跳上了一輛由西往東的電車車廂裹塞滿了黑壓壓的人頭眞的一盞路燈也沒有有人說售票員雖然忙著打票子還是接了一句誰跟你開玩笑呢於是大家都笑笑笑得那樣天眞那樣自然</p>
<p>那條長長的霞飛路在法國民主紀念好天這是上海最整齊光亮的一條馬路現在簡直是對面不見人影開車的一路踏著鈴把勃子拉長了三尺注視著車前的軋道上然而黑影還是如蝙蝠似的在穿梭般來往上海人連死都不怕開車的也祗有歏氣的份兒了</p>
<p>到呂班路車子被迫停止了也沒有人問理由大家在售票的吆喝中下了車馬路上是漆黑一片穿梭的蝙蝠卻更多了</p>
<p>沿著人行道走人行道上都是人幸虧踏痛了腳沒有回聲在白天準是一頓臭罵甚至於動起武來上海人確是喜歡瞧熱門但在漆黑一片中看什麼呢</p>
<p>挨挨擦擦不知走過了幾條馬路前面發見了一盞紅燈定眼一看是敏體尼蔭路上的崗位不過這盞交通燈早已失了效用我為了避一輛三輛腳踏車已被送到大世界後面了這里還是一個比較光明的世界原來許多小販都聚集在這兒天津生梨大來西祗賣三角洋鈿一隻亂烘烘鬧成一片也自有許多人圍在綠玻璃田小燈旁榻便宜貨這就何怪一星期廉價的綢緞舖要敲破大玻璃窗了</p>
<p>從更新橋的竹籬笆中踏進公共租界一家麺店門前蜂擁成羣的提藍攜鍋的人一看錶八點鐘還差二十分上海人已經要吃夜點心了我想下期戶口米恐怕更要少發半斤</p>
<p>沿途看熱門的人羣與法租界一樣所謂摸索前進確自躬親體騐了不過繼而一想也幸有這許多看熱門的人羣否則從呂班路到四馬路如果祇有我一個行路人更要心驚膽怕或許袋里的東西也要一喬遷之喜呢</p>
<p>這是燈火管制第一天有了第一天的經騐第二天也許沒有人告誡早早歸家的話了因為大家在黑暗中呷咖啡跳舞看熱門雖然奇怪的生活也將見怪不怪了吧</p>

<h3 id="c36">五年來的學生救濟會 <a href="#c36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>五年前男女青年會當局因為感到戰事影響下的成千萬青年學生不能繼續上學是社會和國家的一種不可彌補的損失所以就聯合了教會各校校長以及社會熱心人士協力組織了一個學生救濟委員會五年來這個委員會所走的歷程是艱苦的所幸在各委員以及各界人士的贊助合作之下學生救濟委員會還替上海的清寒學生們做了一些雖不怎麼驚人但卻是非常切實的事業</p>
<p>首先學生救濟委員會開創地在上海發起了高中以上清寒學生的助學金報名申請助學的每學期總在數千但因為考試嚴格調查嚴格經濟有限名額有限每學期能夠領受這種助學金的約祗有一百五十——二百名左右去年十二月八日以後因為捐款斷絕這種助學金也祇得隨之停辦這是沒有辦法的事情在學生救濟委員會本身是覺得非常內疚的</p>
<p>其次五年以來學生救濟賒也曾替上海的清寒學生們解決了一個時候的住宿問題自從戰事爆發之後該會就在四馬路五洲大樓七八九三層樓設立了一所學生經濟宿舍這個學生經濟宿舍的設立不但收費極廉而且管理謹嚴使寄宿在裹面的學生節省了不少的開支而且還給了他們一個很靜的課餘休憇處所但也是可惜得很這個事業後來也終於為了房屋租約期滿而不能繼續下去了</p>
<p>學生救濟委員會不但在清寒學生的學費和住的方面盡過這些綿力同時也曾為著清寒學生的衣著而發起過寒衣運動學生救濟委員會曾經在去年國內外捐到了大批的舊西裝舊大衣舊絨線衫等在耶誕的季節中公允地攤派給家境確係清寒衣著的確缺乏的清寒學生使他們不致在寒冬季節裹忍受凍餒的痛苦</p>
<p>第四件事是學生救濟委員會在十二月八日後所舉辦的生活津貼上學期受助的學生也在二百名左右每名自數十元之零用至二百元以上的生活費用都有</p>
<p>在目前學生救濟委員會的工作是集中在解決清寒學生的膳食這一問題上這是有好幾個原因的㈠生活指數在上海暴漲的結果成為全市最大威脅的還是喫飯問題學生也同樣的不能例外學費雖增但一學期三百元終不過是三百元每個學生所必須消費於膳食的一學期卻非一千以上不成㈡助學金之舉不但各校有小額的設施申新兩報現在還有了大規模的支助學生救濟委員會似不必再重複㈢學生宿舍雖在需要上未必次於膳食但因為格於缺乏房屋無法舉辦</p>
<p>但根據過去一二年來的經騐要保證濟助清寒學生膳食的事業得到成功和普遍沒有雄厚的經濟基礎是不行的因為這是一件開著眼睛虧本的事業學生救濟委員會發起擴大的濟助清寒學生膳食的運動其原因也在乎此我們希望各界熱心為善的人士能夠予我們以合作和援助那末他們的熱忱不但直接幫助了無數的窮學生間接也就是替國家社會扶植了一大股雄偉茁壯的力量（吳人）</p>

<h3 id="c55">燈火管制第一夜 <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— 之乎</p>
<p>是燈火管制的第一夜我從寫字間出來一路歸家在上海將近十年從來沒有在家用晚膳的一天從今天起我心裹盤算著可以改過這個習慣了每天在外奔走的人同時也應該早起早眠才是</p>
<p>吃過晚餐甲長已經挨戶來警告了把燈罩罩好窗簾放下不能使燈光露到外面來</p>
<p>兩個孩子的興趣幾乎像過新年一樣</p>
<p>一媽燈罩我來罩小的一個已經爬到桌子上去了</p>
<p>一窗簾找來拉大的一個自然不肯放過機會</p>
<p>妻子特別謹愼跑到樓下天井裹向樓上望著她是看看有沒有燈光露到外面來聽說要罰錢呢不是玩的她的消息似乎特別多</p>
<p>看著桌子上一圈燈光也曾悠悠地想著童年時代在油盞燈下讀書的快樂於是從書桌上隨意抽了一本書翻著翻著</p>
<p>兩個孩子是每天在燈下做功課的今天卻跳到床上去了看見我翻著書大的一個開口了爸這一點燈光下怎好讀書呢</p>
<p>小的沒有大的聰明自己先露了馬腳她接著哥哥說的是</p>
<p>爸我們今天不用讀書了好嗎</p>
<p>妻子笑了起來說都是好主意</p>
<p>我祇翻了二頁書隨手一勉難得有早歸來的日子也該早點睡</p>
<p>房東太太卻從三層樓上跑下來了赴美以我們房門口才看到了我她笑著說李先生今天也早回來了早點回來早點睡剛才甲長來關照九點鐘要熄燈我恐怕李先生沒有回來回來了就好了嘻嘻</p>
<p>要熄燈？我奇怪起來上一次防空演習有許多人家都熄燈早睡後來知道祇要把燈光遮掩還是照常工作甲長的話靠不住吧</p>
<p>不會李家嫂嫂是知道的這叫做聲東擊西法房東太太也慣用這一套的不關燈要罰錢的我可罰不起嘻嘻李先生既然回來了就早點睡罷我到下面去關照了嘻嘻</p>
<p>這又是房東太太的主意罷我心裹想著下面也傳來了反抗的回聲但是房東太太的理由還是我可罰不起</p>
<p>果然九點鐘一敲我們像跌進了地獄一樣連一圈燈光也在房東太太的嘻嘻聲中剝奪了</p>
<p>要十天哩我嘆了一口氣不過房東太太房裹的牌聲也停止了就在黑暗中睡覺吧本來睡熟了是不知道天明天黑的</p>
<h3 id="c56">幸與不幸 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— 自新</p>
<p>年來生活日艱於是常有不知狗之慨看或讀到傲踞於包車踏狂吠的哈叭狗或儲款找尋走失警犬的廣告則更憤懣於色大有怒髪衝天之勢</p>
<p>但偶然於靜僻街角瞥見一匹滿身創傷奄奄待斃的病犬我忽然憎狗之心有了動搖</p>
<p>而且由此我又有了如下的感覺</p>
<p>也許過去它是一匹忠於職守的警犬為工廠主守護財產恰如年青力強的工人代工廠主增加財產而辛勤工作待他與它揮盡汗血就恰如榨完了甜汁的甘蔗剩下渣滓被絕無憐憫地驅出門外</p>
<p>他與它都是命運多麼乘舛的不幸啊</p>
<p>可是另一面卻有著不勞而獲的人與狗他享受著他人一點一滴的血與汗無所事事玩弄著狗及其他以解寂寞它或是長得玲瓏機警無須賣力祇靠獻詔優游自得地吃喝玩倣它一世大人先生的寵兒的生活</p>
<p>他與它看來該都是天之嬌子幸運者</p>
<p>人與狗的幸與不幸是早早安排下的麼是的有史以來人類早早奠定了幸與不幸的基礎但安排的決不是有些人所說的上帝或是菩薩而正是為穏定已得的地盤的聰明的不勞而獲的那些天之嬌子</p>
<p>由此我大澈大悟而憎恨之心於是也從此轉了向</p>
<h3 id="c57">夜街頭的巡禮 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>

<p>夜帶來深沉的黑暗沉重壓住這廿世紀的都市</p>
<p>這裹現在已不再是不夜之城了那把半片大幕抹上一片彩霞的年紅燈光交織成探照燈綱光一般的汽車頭上強烈的燈光都已成了牠輝煌的光芒</p>
<p>所以在這裹的夜的街頭是給黑暗所統治著呑噬著陰森恐怖飄浮在空氣裹替代了各種的燈光而佔有了這夜的街頭的祇有自警團崗亭頂上的紅燈一盞盞的像醉漢的眼睛一般地亮著在黑暗裹是顯得那般莊重森嚴</p>
<p>行人的心是灰黯的滯重的腳步聲裹在慨嘆人生道路的崎嶇吧</p>
<p>路口封鎖的桎梏竹棚像猙獰地露著牙的惡獸般的蹲伏在黑暗裹給予行不少的戒心</p>
<p>交通指南的紅綠燈已不過是人力車夫意識上的憶念了那黑色的制服的印捕兩只揮動著的白色袖筒的確是一種顯殊的清晰的信號標識</p>
<p>幾家商店裹疎洛的燈光依稀地像海上的漁火</p>
<p>街角消失了青年人的微笑那些失去光明照耀的飄泊者踽踽地在黑暗裹找尋著他們的歸宿</p>
<p>誰家的ＲＡＤＩＯ中飄浮出一陣悲愴的情調凄涼的旋律深深地撥動了埋在黑暗裹的流浪者的心弦</p>
<p>廿世紀的都市裹的夜的街頭是這般的沉鬰凄涼</p>

<h3 id="e1">Fierce Fighting Between German and Soviet Troops for Volga Fortress; Soviet Tank Units Launch Counter-Offensives North and South of the City Amidst Heavy Fire <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Allied News Agency, Stockholm, 1st</p>
<p>News from Moscow received here today acknowledges that Stalingrad, on the banks of the Volga River, is facing an even greater threat from German forces. The situation remains dire, with German troops slowly advancing through the ruins of the city. However, the Soviet defenders are showing great determination. According to Reuters Moscow, German tanks in the factory district northwest of the city are advancing, followed by relentless bombing that is making the situation at the Volga River docks extremely tense. German artillery is also concentrating its fire on the narrow central area of the city day and night in an attempt to breach it, no matter how small the opening, to allow German infantry and light machine gunners to pass through. Among the German reinforcements recently deployed to the front lines of Stalingrad are two infantry divisions and one tank division. Fighting is also taking place on the vast plains northwest of Stalingrad, bordering the Don River. German forces have been launching a full-scale assault on Stalingrad for the sixth week. This morning, the city was shrouded in smoke and flames, with large formations of German aircraft soaring overhead, dropping bombs. Soviet forces are launching attacks in the south and north of the city in an attempt to relieve German pressure, making the war even more intense. However, German artillery is employing rapid-action tactics to contain the offensive of General Timoshenko's Soviet forces. Soviet tank assaults have repeatedly been repelled by artillery fire. German forces in the northern part of Stalingrad have made slight gains in the Benzotop region. There is little news regarding developments on the extreme southern front, but Moscow reports that Moscow Radio has reported that the fighting has intensified in the Mozdok region of Eastern Caucasus as the German side has transferred reserve forces.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, German Supreme Headquarters, 1st</p>
<p>Today's German military report stated that fierce fighting for high ground is taking place in the Caucasus region. German aircraft are assisting our forces in Stalingrad in penetrating the northern part of the city. Enemy infantry and tank units launching fierce attacks on German positions north of the city have been dealt a heavy blow, losing 98 tanks, mostly of British and American manufacture.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 1st</p>
<p>According to Associated Press Moscow, German forces have recently been using their latest tactics in the northern part of Stalingrad: a large number of small tanks charging forward, followed by heavily armored vehicles full of machine guns making fierce breakthroughs. Soviet defenders and citizen militias continue to resist stubbornly with hand grenades and Molotov cocktails, but ultimately they are forced to retreat due to the vast disparity in strength. Moreover, Moscow Radio reported that the Stalingrad defenders are determined to resist to the end, vowing never to retreat, even if they are reduced to the last street corner, the last house, and the last drop of blood.</p>

<h3 id="e9">Colonel Tani Ogi Delivers Speech on the Greater East Asia War <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Mito, 1st</p>
<p>Colonel Tani Ogi Nahao, head of the Army Press Department of the Japanese General Headquarters, gave a military speech at the Ibaraki Hall here yesterday, titled "How to Complete the Greater East Asia War." The gist of his speech is as follows: The center of the enemy in the Greater East Asia War is the United States. Therefore, the end of the Greater East Asia War should also be resolved by the United States surrendering. When reviewing the future of the Greater East Asia War, we must first grasp the US strategy towards Japan and the operational policy towards Japan. The United States is currently planning to expand its military equipment by the end of 1944, and then take a major offensive against Japan. The content is 4 million army personnel, 20,000 frontline aircraft, and the navy building 2.6 million tons of ships, 15,000 frontline aircraft, and in the preparation period, using aircraft and submarines to carry out attrition warfare against Japan. However, in today's world, today's strategy and tactics cannot be used tomorrow. How it will change is truly unpredictable. Before the Greater East Asia War, the tactics adopted by the United States were battleship centralism, also known as the giant gunship doctrine. However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the unsinkable warships boasted by the US Navy have been sunk by the Japanese Navy at Pearl Harbor and the Malayan waters. They also painfully realized that the power of the air force was insufficient, so they abandoned their battleship centralism and adopted aircraft carrier centralism. This can be proven by the US Navy's plan to rush to build 85 aircraft carriers and the tactics used by the United States in the Coral Sea, Midway Island, and the Second Solomon Sea battle, which were mainly aircraft carriers. In the above battles, the losses of US aircraft carriers were very heavy. They then gained a new lesson, that is, if there are Japanese land bases, it is unfavorable to send a fleet mainly composed of an aircraft carrier to carry out operations. Therefore, they started to build land bases thoroughly on the continuous line from the Aleutian Islands in the north, through Midway Island to the Solomon Islands and the New Guinea Islands in the southwest Pacific, attempting to obtain land air bases. However, this plan still failed, so they planned to build long-range, super-heavy bombers. According to recent news, the super-heavy bomber can complete a 12,000-kilometer non-stop flight from Brisbane Port on the east coast of Australia to San Francisco on the west coast of the United States in 36 hours. If this is true, then Tokyo to Midway Island is only 8,000 kilometers, and Japan should make full preparations in both material and spiritual aspects. As for the situation in the north, Britain and the United States have repeatedly made plots and propaganda, attempting to alienate Japanese-Soviet relations. This really needs to be guarded against. In short, no matter what plots Britain and the United States make, Japan has the determination and countermeasures to deal with it. We can also say that the Greater East Asia War really started today. The United States is now beginning to prepare for war. Japan has absolute confidence in dealing with the US military force. At the same time, in order to win the economic war, we should strive to increase production and savings, and especially strive for important battles in order to establish a system of invincible war.</p>

<p>Allied News Agency, Lisbon, 1st</p>
<p>London: The British Secretary of State for India, Amery, stated in the House of Commons today that the British government still firmly refuses to negotiate with the Indian National Congress Party to resolve the Indian issue. The Labor Party Member of Parliament, Sorensen, asked Mr. Amery whether he knew that many politicians in India who were not members of the Congress Party wanted to communicate with the banned Congress Party leaders in order to find a solution. Mr. Amery replied that he did not believe that contact with Congress Party members at this time would promote a solution. When asked about intelligence that British aircraft had strafed Indian crowds, Mr. Amery avoided answering directly, only saying that he had nothing to add to the official announcement made in the Indian Legislative Assembly last week. The announcement stated that British aircraft had strafed Indians who had secretly sabotaged railways for convenience five times. Mr. Amery also said that in areas where troop movements were obstructed by railways, it was necessary to use aircraft to suppress the rioters' secret sabotage. Furthermore, the British government is not considering organizing an Indian national government.</p>

<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 1st</p>
<p>Hitler's speech this time expounded in detail the economic situation of the Soviet summer campaign, the general military situation, the war against Britain, submarine warfare, and air warfare. The leader first stated the development of the occupied areas of Eastern Europe, making Europe not only lack raw materials and food, but also the Soviet Union's loss of such valuable commerce and industrial areas has inevitably exhausted its strength. Regarding the Stalingrad battle, the leader believed that the purpose of the summer offensive had been achieved due to the blocking of the Volga River. The leader also revealed that Germany will use the winter time and the technology of a large number of foreign technicians to manufacture more sophisticated new weapons in preparation for the coming spring. Neutral military observers in Berlin attach importance to the leader's statement of stepping up submarine production and warned that Britain's indiscriminate bombing is even more worrying. General Rommel was also present when the leader delivered his speech. Rommel looked radiant and in good spirits, which shows that the foreign rumors that Rommel was suffering from an unknown disease were untrue.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 1st</p>
<p>Hitler presided over the winter relief rally at the Berlin Sports Arena yesterday. First, Minister of Propaganda Goebbels gave an opening speech, and then the leader gave a speech in warm cheers, satirizing Roosevelt and Churchill, saying that they only indulged in empty talk, and he only knew how to be down-to-earth and pragmatic, only seeking to solve the urgent problems at hand and had no time to deduce the future situation. The Atlantic Charter is a stupid literary work, and its effectiveness will inevitably be shattered by iron facts in a few years. The full text of the leader's speech is as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Mocking Roosevelt and Churchill <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>For years, Roosevelt and Churchill have hindered the implementation of the National Socialist Party's plans, but they have never succeeded. Now, the promises they offer to the world are the same as what we have done in Germany. Then, they actually declared war on us on this basis. Is it not a strange fact? It is even more ridiculous that Roosevelt and Churchill are now posing as saviors of the world's crisis, failing to recognize the times. British and American propaganda often disregards the facts and conceals Germany's great victories. However, in recent months, the German army's battle achievements have shocked the world. Under favorable circumstances, it can be asserted that it will directly attack the Don River, then the Volga River, and arrive at and occupy Stalingrad. However, Britain and the United States still say that it is not relevant to the overall situation. Then, our army has occupied 65% to 70% of the Soviet Union's iron ore resources, developed the world's largest grain-producing area, and entered the Soviet Union's Moitian, which has become a momentum to shake the Soviet Union's economic lifeline.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Second Front <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the opening of the second front, as when the Canadian army and a small number of British troops recently attacked Dieppe, they were defeated by the German army in less than nine hours. This shows the lack of strength of Britain and the United States. The intention of Britain and the United States to open up the second front is only propaganda to threaten Germany, and there is nothing to fear. Even if Britain and the United States really have the power to attack, there is now more than enough power to counterattack. No matter where Churchill makes another landing attempt, it would be Churchill's luck if he could stay on land for nine hours. Last winter, with the help of God, the German people and armed comrades were finally able to safely pass through the past and defeat General Winter. The German soldiers' fighting spirit was firm and unyielding. After entering the spring, they launched an offensive. This alone is enough to prove that God is also loyal to the German people. The offensive launched by the German army after spring may not have been foreseen by the enemy. In the past three years of battle achievements, the German army has conquered the west and the east, and has won every battle. The German soldiers are both intelligent and brave, and have established the victory of this war. The German people are all happy about this.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Battle Plan <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>The battle plan of our army this year is still very simple, that is, 1. Calmly respond to all incidents. Where our army does not intend to attack, it will stand firm and defend, making the enemy tired and self-defeating. 2. Where we must attack, we will implement the attack. Our operational purpose is also very simple, that is, to destroy the mainstay of the international conspirators. The strategy of the German army against the Soviet Union in the summer of this year was to eliminate the remnants of the Crimean Peninsula, gain control of the Black Sea, and launch the Battle of Kerch and the Battle of Sevastopol from this point. Then, sweep away the traces of the enemy on the Volkhov River and prepare to break through the Soviet army's defense line on the Don River. At that time, the Soviet army attempted to break into the Hombach River from Kharkov and defeat the two German army positions on the Eastern Front. However, the German army took preemptive measures before it launched, making its plan a bubble. The purpose of the German army's major offensive this time is three: 1. To seize the Soviet Union's last wheat-producing area. 2. Deprive it of its remaining coking coal. 3. Seize its oil fields or cut off its supply lines. After the offensive was launched, the Volga River, the largest transportation artery in the Soviet Union, became the only goal of our army. Therefore, the Don River Bay, the Volga River, and Stalingrad became places that must be contested. Then, cutting off the Volga River and occupying Stalingrad can take a step further to complete this strategy. Now the period is not far away.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Use of Winter <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Another plan of Germany this year is to organize a vast occupied area. Most of the tens of thousands of kilometers of railway lines have now been repaired, and thousands of bridges are yet to be built. Our army does not intend to make further progress into enemy territory this winter. The biggest task at present will be to develop the occupied area and stabilize the supply of food and raw materials that we need, in order to maintain the production business of the whole of Europe. Regarding the African war, the German army has now suddenly stopped attacking. This is a steady and steady strategy. After the supply line is fully organized, it will act accordingly. Germany's plan to organize the midline occupied area has now begun. German farmers are already engaged in farming work a few kilometers behind the front line. The German recent increase in the bread restriction is due to the agricultural production in the occupied areas of the Eastern Front. This matter is still in its infancy, and this satisfactory result has already been achieved. Therefore, there is no doubt that Europe's economic life will improve day by day in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Celebrating Allies <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The alliance between Germany and its friendly countries is now becoming stronger and stronger. Although the enemy has used various conspiracies to destroy it, the result has always been unsuccessful. Japan's brilliant military achievements are admirable to us. Today, we have finally obtained a true world alliance and are striving to build a new world order together. The leader then discussed the British air raid on Germany, saying that when British aircraft first bombed the German people in May 1940, he made a serious warning to Churchill. Unexpectedly, Churchill ignored it and repeatedly carried out his barbaric atrocities. Therefore, Germany could not bear it any longer and had to retaliate. Today, the suffering of Britain's air raids is even worse than that of Germany. The Jew who started it has already reaped the consequences. The leader explained the nature of the Eastern Front war, saying that the people under German National Socialism have become more united because of the war, and the cooperation between Germany and its allies has also increased. The friendly forces of various countries fighting on the Eastern Front are now the most loyal comrades of the Axis powers.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Never Kneel <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The spirit of sacrifice of the German workers should also be written and specially written, because German workers have been working 10 to 11 hours a day since this spring. In some factories, there are even no weekends or other holidays. The purpose is to accelerate the production of war equipment. I dare to guarantee to the people of the country that the German soldiers on the front line are indestructible. I also told the soldiers on the front line that the people in the country will never put them aside. Within this amount of time, we will never allow the activities of saboteurs. The leader's conclusion said that under any circumstances, we will never surrender. Our enemies will obviously try their best to prolong the war, but we will also do our best to defeat it. As for the enemy wanting to defeat us, it is impossible. National Socialist Germany and its allies will produce a glorious victory in this war.</p>

<h3 id="e26">Blackout Drill on the First Day Lasted Two Hours <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Future Drills to be Held at Any Time in Preparation</p>
<p>The blackout drill, which had been in preparation for a month, began at 7:30 PM yesterday. After receiving notification from the authorities, each household immediately installed lamp shades and curtains. The situation was more serious than the last time. Some stores closed early. Trams and buses operated as usual, but at a slower speed. After 8:00 PM, a loud alarm sounded, and the entire city was plunged into darkness, which was particularly tense. The Chief of the Police Department and the Director of the Air Defense Department of the Public Works Department issued a statement urging citizens to strictly abide by all regulations during the air defense blackout period. The two-hour drill was reported by the Greater East Asia Radio Station. It is hoped that citizens will be prepared at any time in the future.</p>
<p>Drill Results Not Yet Reported</p>
<p>The results of the first large-scale blackout drill held last night have not yet been reported truthfully. However, it is expected that the most failed point that the authorities believed to be the case a month ago, that is, most citizens failed to remain calm during the drill, will not be repeated this time. The authorities have repeatedly stated that citizens should operate or work as usual during the blackout. The Medical Officer of Health of the Public Works Department, Mr. Watanabe, was scheduled to return to Shanghai from Japan by ship yesterday to participate in the inspection of Shanghai's first expanded air defense exercise, but there was no news of Mr. Watanabe's arrival in Shanghai yesterday. When the Director of the Air Defense Section of the Police Department of the Public Works Department, Mr. Matsumoto, received newspaper reporters, he claimed that the simulated blackout training conducted in the Public Concession since September 20 had achieved unexpectedly good results. Therefore, he could guarantee to the Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters that the ten-day blackout training that started yesterday would be effective.</p>

<p>For the sake of assisting in the holding of a large-scale air raid drill, the Baojia authorities of the French Concession yesterday began a full mobilization of the civil police force. Each Lianbao (group of bao) was temporarily assigned a post, with duty commencing from 8:00 AM and continuing until 12:00 midnight. When on duty, each member of the civil police force carried a bell, which they would ring to warn residents within the area when an air raid commenced and concluded, so that they would be aware.</p>
<p>Baobei Foreigners' Baojia on Duty</p>
<p>The self-defense corps of the Foreigners' Baojia in the various districts of Baobei in the Public Concession began going on duty yesterday afternoon. The head of the Foreigners' Baojia, Kataige (chairman of the Jewish Federation), set an example by being the first to carry out the new duty of going on duty. It is reported that Baobei is divided into three Baojia districts: Hongkou, Huishan, and Yulin, totaling 41 bao. More than 2,000 foreigners will take turns serving as self-defense corps members, each person being on duty for three hours every five days. It was revealed at a meeting of the Foreigners' Baojia on Tuesday that the Foreigners' Self-Defense Corps lacked funds to purchase equipment such as police batons and guard booths. Therefore, it was decided to instruct all Jewish immigrants in Baobei to report the amount of their income so that it could be submitted to the police department to determine who could donate cash to purchase equipment to be issued to the Foreigners' Self-Defense Corps members and to build guard booths on the streets.</p>
<p>Director General Okazaki Issues Statement</p>
<p>The local branch of the Domei News Agency reports that Director General Okazaki of the Public Works Department issued a statement yesterday morning, asking the general public to cooperate fully during the ten-day blackout period so that the air raid drill implemented by the authorities could be completely successful. According to Okazaki's disclosure, the Public Works Department has completed all necessary preparations for rescue, fire fighting, and police services during air raids, in accordance with a plan that has been prepared for several months. The general headquarters for air defense in the Public Concession will be located in the general office of the Public Works Department. The police department will be responsible for guiding the public and maintaining治安 during the alert and blackout period. The rescue team of the health department will be fully responsible for all rescue work, such as urgently sending seriously injured persons to hospitals. Due to the different local conditions, the air raid fire fighting methods used in Japan will be modified and implemented in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Once the Red Packet clock stopped, it has been nearly ten months. The Tianchu MSG advertisement on the International Hotel no longer looks down on all of Shanghai. Even more unthinkable, 90% of the more than 7,000 streetlights have been lost. Yet, Shanghai still has a day shrouded in darkness. The people of Shanghai are now living a strange life.</p>
<p>Daytime</p>
<p>In the cafes, everyone is talking about the blackout. In the dance halls, no one will come out to dance at night, right? Someone said that on the streets, in cars, everyone is advising to go home early.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is because of this strange life. In the cafes shrouded in black cloth, people are still sipping their coffee, which is getting more expensive with each cup, and exhaling circles of smoke. Under the pale green light, how poetic the mood! In the dance halls, candles are lit on the piano, and the candlelight dance in Waterloo Bridge is the medium for the merging of two hearts.</p>
<p>On Jin Shenfu Road, I jumped into a tram heading from west to east. The carriage was filled with black heads. There really wasn't a single streetlight. Someone said the ticket seller, though busy punching tickets, still interjected, "Who's kidding you?" So everyone laughed, laughed so innocently, so naturally.</p>
<p>That long Xiafei Road, in the days of French Democracy Memorial, was the most orderly and brightly lit road in Shanghai. Now, you simply can't see anyone across the street. The driver, constantly ringing the bell, stretched his neck three feet long, watching the tracks in front of the car. However, black shadows were still shuttling back and forth like bats. The people of Shanghai are not even afraid of death. The driver can only sigh.</p>
<p>At Luban Road, the car was forced to stop. No one asked why. Everyone got off the car amid the ticket seller's shouts. The street was pitch black, and there were even more bats shuttling around.</p>
<p>Walking along the sidewalk, the sidewalk was full of people. Fortunately, there was no echo when my foot was stepped on. In the daytime, it would have been a scolding or even a fight. The people of Shanghai really like to watch热闹 (rè nào, a lively scene), but what is there to see in the pitch black?</p>
<p>Stumbling along, I don't know how many streets I passed. Ahead, I found a red light. Looking closely, it was the post on Min Ti Ni Yin Road. However, this traffic light had long been out of order. I had been sent behind the Great World to avoid one, two, three bicycles. This is still a relatively bright world. It turned out that many vendors were gathered here. Tianjin pears and big lychees were only selling for three jiao apiece. It was a noisy scene, and many people were also gathered around the small green glass lights, buying cheap goods. No wonder the cheap silk shops were smashing their large glass windows for the week-long sale.</p>
<p>Stepping into the Public Concession from the bamboo fence of Gengxin Bridge, a crowd of people carrying baskets and pots swarmed in front of a noodle shop. Looking at my watch, it was twenty minutes to eight o'clock. The people of Shanghai were already eating their midnight snacks. I thought the household rice allocation for the next term would probably be reduced by half a catty.</p>
<p>The crowds watching the热闹 (rè nào, a lively scene) along the way were the same as in the French Concession. The so-called groping forward was a personal experience. However, on second thought, it was fortunate that there were so many crowds watching热闹 (rè nào, a lively scene). Otherwise, if I were the only person walking from Luban Road to Sima Road, I would be even more frightened, and perhaps the things in my bag would also be "moving house."</p>
<p>This was the first day of the blackout. With the experience of the first day, perhaps no one will advise going home early on the second day, because everyone is sipping coffee, dancing, and watching热闹 (rè nào, a lively scene) in the dark. Although it is a strange life, it will become commonplace.</p>

<h3 id="e33">Baojia Publicity Week Postponed Due to Heavy Workload and Inadequate Preparation <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>To be held from the 5th to the 15th</p>
<p>In order to improve the security of the concession, assist in promoting Baojia self-defense work, and raise funds, the Baojia authorities of the Public Concession have initiated a Baojia self-defense publicity and fundraising campaign. Meetings have been held on separate days, and it has been decided to raise 2 million yuan for Baojia expenses. In order to ensure that the people within the concession truly understand the true meaning of Baojia, the originally scheduled Baojia expanded publicity week from October 1st to 10th has been postponed to October 5th to 15th due to the heavy workload of the publicity work, according to inquiries made to the Baojia authorities. The publicity methods are divided into the following types: (A) Written publicity; (B) Radio publicity, inviting Baojia committee members, Baojia guidance committee members, and social celebrities to speak about the meaning of the movement; (C) Entertainment publicity, requesting various entertainers to insert words and phrases related to the movement into their performances so that the audience can understand the meaning of Baojia self-defense imperceptibly (the words and phrases will be drafted by the Baojia committee and distributed to the entertainers for publicity to ensure uniformity); (D) Film and lantern slides with text will be shown in various cinemas; (E) Lecture publicity, the method is the same as item B.</p>
<h3 id="e34">French Concession Civil Police Recognized for Diligence and Awarded Commendation <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>At 9:30 AM on September 30th of this year, Shen Fupu, a member of the 788th Civil Police Group of the 38th Lianbao of the French Concession, was on duty at the intersection of Jixiang Street and Fada Road in the Mailan District when he saw Hu Kaifu, a shop assistant from the No. 7 Qianzhuang in Lane 247 of Tianjin Road (resident of No. 170, Wenmiao Road, Nanshi), snatching banknotes worth 2,548.50 yuan from Chen Shenghua (17 years old, resident of No. 4, Lane 33, Zilai Street), who was holding them under his arm. He immediately stepped forward to pursue and arrest him. The Inspector General of the French Concession Police Department was extremely satisfied with the actions of the civil police group member and awarded him a special commendation.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Respectable Merchant Implicated in Robbery of Woolen Cloth Store <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>After Jiangbei bandit Zhou Qifu colluded with a gang and robbed the Turongtai Woolen Cloth Store at No. 80 Luban Road in the French Concession in May of this year, the victim reported the case and requested an arrest. The detectives arrested the thief Zhou, who confessed that his accomplices were Chen Liechang (owner of Chen Tai Wood Shop at Zhangjiazhai, Avenue Edward VII) and Liu Zhiming (owner of Zhongyuan Company at No. 206, Continental Building, Jiujiang Road, resident of No. 8, Daodeli, Beile Road). The detectives then arrested Chen Liechang and continued to investigate the case. However, when detectives Xu Kaixing, Zhu Jutong, and Chen Rongtang went to No. 8, Daodeli, Beile Road to arrest Liu Zhiming, Liu began to scream. The detectives then solicited bribes, but Liu reported them to the police station, and the three detectives Xu, Zhu, and Chen were detained for investigation. Now, after a thorough investigation by the West Detective of the French Police Department, it was determined that Liu Zhiming did indeed collude with Zhou and his gang to commit the robbery. Therefore, at 6:00 AM yesterday, Liu Zhiming was arrested again and immediately escorted to the court to be tried together with Zhou and the others. It was also stated that a detailed investigation of Liu Zhiming's part was still needed, and a request was made to postpone the court hearing. Zhou Qifu confessed that at the time, he was invited by Gao Xiaosanzi, who was still at large, along with Liu Zhiming, Chen Liechang, and other civilians, to rob the Turongtai Woolen Cloth Store. However, when questioned, Liu vehemently denied the matter. Chen Liechang's defense lawyer claimed that his client had been wronged. Chen Liechang was released on 10,000 yuan bail, while Liu, Zhou, and the others were all kept in custody.</p>
<h3 id="e36">The Student Relief Association Over the Past Five Years <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Five years ago, the authorities of the YMCA and YWCA felt that the fact that tens of thousands of young students could not continue their studies due to the impact of the war was an irreparable loss to society and the country. Therefore, they joined forces with the principals of church schools and enthusiastic people from all walks of life to organize a Student Relief Committee. Over the past five years, the committee has gone through a difficult journey. Fortunately, with the support and cooperation of the committee members and people from all walks of life, the Student Relief Committee has done some things for the poor students of Shanghai that, while not very surprising, are very practical.</p>
<p>First of all, the Student Relief Committee pioneered the establishment of scholarships for poor students above the high school level in Shanghai. Every semester, thousands of students apply for scholarships, but because the exams are strict, the investigations are strict, and the funding is limited, only about 150 to 200 students can receive this scholarship each semester. After December 8th of last year, because donations were cut off, this scholarship had to be suspended, which was unavoidable. The Student Relief Committee itself felt very guilty about this.</p>
<p>Secondly, over the past five years, the Student Relief Association has also solved the accommodation problem for poor students in Shanghai for a period of time. Since the outbreak of the war, the association has established a Student Economic Dormitory on the 3rd, 7th, and 8th floors of the Wuzhou Building on Sima Road. The establishment of this Student Economic Dormitory not only charged extremely low fees but also had strict management, which saved the students living in it a lot of expenses and also gave them a quiet place to rest after class. But it is also a pity that this undertaking eventually could not continue due to the expiration of the lease.</p>
<p>The Student Relief Committee has not only done its best to help poor students with their tuition fees and accommodation, but has also launched a winter clothing campaign for poor students. Last year, the Student Relief Committee received a large number of old suits, old coats, and old woolen sweaters from home and abroad, which were fairly distributed to poor students whose families were indeed poor and whose clothing was indeed lacking during the Christmas season, so that they would not suffer from cold and hunger in the cold winter season.</p>
<p>The fourth thing is the living allowances provided by the Student Relief Committee after December 8th. About 200 students were assisted last semester, with each student receiving living expenses ranging from dozens of yuan in pocket money to more than 200 yuan.</p>
<p>Currently, the work of the Student Relief Committee is focused on solving the problem of meals for poor students. There are several reasons for this: ㈠ As a result of the soaring cost of living in Shanghai, the biggest threat to the city is still the problem of eating. Students are no exception. Although tuition fees have increased, 300 yuan per semester is still only 300 yuan. However, the semesterly food expenses of each student must be more than 1,000 yuan. ㈡ Not only do various schools have small-scale scholarship programs, but the Shen and Xin newspapers now also have large-scale support. It seems that the Student Relief Committee does not need to repeat its efforts. ㈢ Although student dormitories may not be secondary to meals in terms of need, they cannot be held due to a lack of housing.</p>
<p>However, according to the experience of the past one or two years, a solid economic foundation is necessary to ensure the success and universality of the undertaking of assisting poor students with meals, because this is a business that loses money with open eyes. The Student Relief Committee's launch of an expanded campaign to assist poor students with meals is also due to this reason. We hope that people from all walks of life who are enthusiastic about doing good will be able to cooperate with and assist us. Then, their enthusiasm will not only directly help countless poor students, but will also indirectly support a large, magnificent, and thriving force for the country and society (Wu Ren).</p>

<p>The 65th session of the Rongwu Sutra Lecture Society featured Shen Jueling speaking on the theme of "Focusing on Oneself is Common to All Five Religions." Mr. Shen, with a slight waist pain from a fall yesterday, lectured on the Confucian emphasis on oneself and then withdrew. Yang Zhongyi continued to speak on the Buddhist and Taoist emphasis on oneself and then dispersed. The 66th session featured Shen Jueling continuing to lecture on the previous topic, the Christian emphasis on oneself according to the Old Testament, and the Islamic emphasis on oneself according to the Quran. Zhao Ximing then elaborated on the meaning of sincerity achieving itself and the Way following itself in great detail, with many encouraging words for those seeking the Way. Gu Daogong then spoke on the difference between "我 (wǒ, I)" and "吾 (wú, I)," saying that "我 (wǒ, I)" comes from "戈 (gē, spear)" and "古 (gǔ, ancient)," the character for "kill," hence Confucius rejected "我 (wǒ, I)." "吾 (wú, I)" comes from "口 (kǒu, mouth)" and "五 (wǔ, five)" sounds. Five is the central number of heaven and earth. Universally referring to oneself as "吾 (wú, I)" is suitable for the middle way. It is said that on October 4th, Shen Jueling will lecture on the study of the Book of Changes, the differences between the Jing and Zhuan, and the similarities and differences.</p>

<p>The final act of the football trial match was the third meeting between Donghua and Shengfangji, which was held at the racecourse at 5:00 PM yesterday. The audience reached 5,000. Under extreme tension, Donghua narrowly defeated Shengfangji by a score of 2 to 1. Donghua relied on good luck, especially the goalkeeper Zhang Banglun's excellent performance, making great contributions. Yuan Kun's sharp breakthroughs in the forward line were also a great contribution. Zhuang Youren, Han Longhai, Jia Youliang, and Zai Linjing had effective coordination. Liang Shutang maintained his original state. Shu Shigeng's offense was not satisfactory, and the goal was often open. Pan Honghai's skills were not as good as the Sheng team. Greenburg made the most contribution, running all over the field. Funnjie and Muhuada and Edward were all just right. The first half ended in a 0-0 draw. In the second half, Sheng team's Green repeatedly fouled, resulting in a penalty kick, which was taken by Han Longhai. The ball went into the net. Both sides were unwilling to concede. Before long, the time was up. Donghua luckily defeated Shengfangji 2-1.</p>

<p>Surplus of 79,964 Yuan Remaining</p>
<p>After the conclusion of the third session of the Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund, the number of applicants, the number of approved applicants, the scholarship expenditure, and the total amount of donations for the various large, medium, and small tutorial groups have been listed and announced one by one (see this newspaper on September 27th). However, it is feared that a small number of students may have received the check from this newspaper but were unable to attend school and did not return the check. Therefore, it is declared that the bank's month-end statement is required. The bank's transaction details have now been cleared. As of September 30th, the total surplus is 79,964.92 yuan.</p>
<p>Income</p>
<p>Since the launch of this scholarship on June 20th, the enthusiastic support of people from all walks of life has resulted in a considerable amount of donations. As of September 30th, a total of 226,705.30 yuan has been received (including a surplus of 33,698.09 yuan from the previous session and 207.52 yuan in bank interest).</p>
<p>Expenditure</p>
<p>The total scholarship expenditure was 146,730 yuan (the original checks issued by this newspaper totaled 147,531.50 yuan, with a small number of students not cashing them in for a total of 801.50 yuan). After deducting the interest income tax of 10.08 yuan, the total expenditure was 146,740.38 yuan. The total surplus should be 79,964.92 yuan. The large number of checks issued for this scholarship were provided free of charge by the Zhongnan Bank. We would like to express our sincere gratitude.</p>

<h3 id="e44">After 200 Consecutive Drops, Chinese Stocks Suddenly Rise Again <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Gongxin Electrical Appliances Debuts</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market first fell sharply and then suddenly rose, regaining its firm footing. The turning point was due to the excessive drops in the past two days. Investors were encouraged, and the overall confidence of all parties turned from tired to hopeful that it would continue to prosper. The increasing news of the preparation for the establishment of a securities market is another factor in the upward movement of prices. In the textile industry, Yong'an Textile broke through the 1,600 yuan mark and then rebounded. It has risen from 1,590 yuan to 1,645 yuan. The small-denomination stocks Hongsheng and Dachina Weaving both rose from 11 yuan to 12 yuan, finally matching Fuchang at 17.50 yuan. Shanghai Cotton Weaving and An Da Shirts also rebounded after falling, but they were still slightly lower than the previous day, with the former down 5 jiao and the latter down 1 yuan. Nanyang Tobacco Company rose from 102 yuan to 106 yuan, rebounding by 1 yuan. Dachina Match fell to a low of half a yuan, fluctuating between 210 yuan and 215 yuan. In the department store industry, Yong'an rebounded to the 120 yuan mark, rising by 1 yuan alone. Xinxin was down 5 yuan, and Guohuo was down 3 yuan, both at 115 yuan, following the trend of first falling and then rebounding. Underwear was slightly lower by 2.5 jiao. The cultural industry was the most stable, with only World Bookstore down 5 jiao. Commercial Press at 195 yuan, China at 195 yuan, and Yongxiang at 25.50 yuan all matched. In the pharmaceutical industry, Zhongxi was down 15 yuan at 435 yuan, Wuzhou added 2.5 yuan to reach 297.50 yuan, Xinya was down 7.5 jiao at 45.50 yuan, and Zhongfa fell to a low of 81 yuan and then rebounded by 2 yuan, matching Minyi at 65 yuan. Transportation stocks fell the most. Zhabei Water and Electricity was the lowest at 36 yuan, and Chinese Electric was down by more than 1 yuan at 31.50 yuan. Gongxin Electrical Appliances debuted at a price of 12 yuan, and buyers were enthusiastic. Other stocks have also rebounded. The details are recorded below.</p>

<p>Due to numerous short-covering activities in the unofficial over-the-counter market for public bonds, market prices surged. However, sellers were also quite active, readily selling at the high prices, resulting in favorable deals. The market atmosphere resembled that of easily frightened birds, a state of self-induced alarm, but not entirely without cause. The market price rose to above fifty yuan, exceeding the face value of the bonds. It is rumored that the authorities believe this is unsuitable and that official trading can only commence when the price is within fifty yuan. While this rumor lacks concrete evidence, it is not entirely unfounded. Abnormal and disproportionate price increases are unlikely to benefit the market. Yesterday, Type C bonds initially traded at 54 yuan, reaching a high of 55.4 yuan, with the final price also at 55.3 yuan. Type A bonds were priced even higher than Type C, while Type B bonds experienced a sharp increase of 2.1 yuan, reaching 4.8 yuan. Types D and E also saw a good increase of 1.5 to 1.6 yuan. The transactions were chaotic and difficult to track.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Decorative Gold Exchange Rate Listed Slightly Below 2400 Yuan <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai gold and jewelry industry association, Da Xin Tong Hang, listed the exchange rate for decorative gold at 2450 yuan per tael at retail outlets. Around 10:00 AM, it was slightly reduced by 50 yuan to 2400 yuan (purchase price reduced by over 300 yuan). Inter-dealer trading prices fell even more sharply, dropping close to the 2100 yuan level. The market situation was weak, with the lowest price being 2180 yuan, down 10 yuan. Amid selling pressure, it fell to 2120 yuan, before rising to 2150 yuan due to buying by a certain group. At noon, it declined again, with a difference of 60 yuan. Trading volume was sparse. The price of standard silver for jewelry was 14 yuan per tael, while the inter-dealer trading price was 13.5 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Military Bond Settlement Rare After Month's End <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange market saw a slight drop in Japanese military scrip, due to fewer settlements after the month's end. The inter-dealer trading price was 5.5546 yuan. Banks and small money shops sold at 5.565 yuan and bought at 5.545 yuan, the same as the previous day.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Money Trade Association's overnight loan interest rate remained at 1.4%.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Scarce Arrival of Miscellaneous Grains <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of beans was again delayed, leading to reduced supply and sales, and very little trading. Only 30 bags of Tianjin red beans were traded at a price of 165 yuan. Two batches of Chongming sand red beans were priced at 164 yuan.</p>
<p>Arrivals of red sorghum were scarce, leading to brisk sales and a rising trend. Yesterday, one cart of Mingguang red sorghum was priced at 117 yuan, and 50 bags of old stock were priced at 98 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Cotton Cloth Dips, Then Halts Decline as Buyers Hunt for Bargains <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Factory Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market initially weakened but then strengthened, with the situation stabilizing. White goods and fine cloth transactions saw prices rise due to dealers searching for bargains. Twelve-pound Dachen Factory singles rose to 157.1 yuan, Fugui Factory singles to 154 yuan, and Bank singles to 151 to 152 yuan with some selling. Coarse cloth also remained firm. Sixteen-pound Diqiu was at 188 yuan, eight-pound Zhenzhong at 110 yuan. Taohua Nvshi Lin initially opened at 249.5 yuan, rising to 250.5 yuan and then falling back to around 249 yuan. However, market sentiment improved and prices gradually rose, reaching a high of 251.75 yuan, an increase of approximately 2 yuan per bolt.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth</p>
<p>The gray market also initially fell but then rose. New singles of Dragon Head fine cloth were rarely sold and did not experience much price movement. At the noon close, it was quoted at 166 yuan, while the smallest transaction for Bank singles was 154.75 yuan, before rising to 156.5 yuan, an increase of 0.5 yuan. Caiqiu was at 155.25 yuan, Feiyu at 154 yuan, Yanghe at 153 yuan, Labu at 152 yuan, and the Hong Dan of Sijunzi Serge was stable at 6.82 to 6.83 yuan for a long time. Later, some buying occurred, and it rose back to 6.86 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e55">The First Night of Blackout Regulations <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Zhizhu</p>
<p>It is the first night of blackout regulations. I left my office and headed home. I have been in Shanghai for nearly ten years and have never had dinner at home. From today onwards, I plan to change this habit. People who are busy outside every day should also get up early and go to bed early.</p>
<p>After dinner, the neighborhood head had already gone door-to-door to warn people to cover their lamps and lower their curtains so that no light could be seen outside.</p>
<p>The two children were almost as excited as if it were New Year's.</p>
<p>"Mom, I'll cover the lamps!" the younger one had already climbed onto the table.</p>
<p>"Find the curtains and pull them down!" the older one naturally didn't want to miss the opportunity.</p>
<p>My wife was particularly cautious, running downstairs to the courtyard to look up at the apartment to see if any light was visible outside. I heard there was a fine if you didn't comply, it's no joke. It seemed she had a lot of information.</p>
<p>Looking at the circle of light on the table, I couldn't help but think of the happiness of reading under the oil lamp in my childhood. So I randomly picked up a book from my desk and started flipping through it.</p>
<p>The two children do their homework under the lamp every day, but today they jumped onto the bed. Seeing me flipping through a book, the older one said, "Dad, how can we read in this little light?"</p>
<p>The younger one wasn't as clever as the older one, and she gave herself away first. She continued what her brother said:</p>
<p>"Dad, can we not study today?"</p>
<p>My wife laughed and said, "Those are all good ideas."</p>
<p>I only flipped through two pages of the book and reluctantly closed it. It's rare to come home early, so I should go to bed early.</p>
<p>The landlady, however, ran down from the third floor. She saw me at our door and said with a smile, "Mr. Li, you're home early today too. Go to bed early. The neighborhood head just came to say that the lights have to be turned off at nine o'clock. I was afraid you wouldn't be back. Now that you're back, that's good, hee hee."</p>
<p>"Turn off the lights?" I wondered. Last time, during the air raid drill, many people turned off their lights and went to bed early. Later, I learned that as long as the lights were covered, we could still work as usual. The neighborhood head's words can't be trusted, right?</p>
<p>"No, Mrs. Li knows. This is called a feint. The landlady is used to this kind of thing. There's a fine if you don't turn off the lights. I can't afford to be fined, hee hee. Since Mr. Li is back, go to bed early. I'll go downstairs and tell them, hee hee."</p>
<p>This must be the landlady's idea, I thought. I also heard voices of protest from downstairs, but the landlady's reason was still, "I can't afford to be fined."</p>
<p>Sure enough, at nine o'clock, it felt like we had fallen into hell. Even the circle of light was taken away in the landlady's hee-hee laughter.</p>
<p>"It's going to be ten days," I sighed. But the sound of mahjong in the landlady's room had also stopped. Just sleep in the dark then. When you're fast asleep, you don't know whether it's dark or light.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Fortune and Misfortune <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— Zixin</p>
<p>Life has become increasingly difficult in recent years, so I often feel resentful. When I see or read advertisements about pampered Pekingese dogs riding in rickshaws or advertisements searching for lost police dogs with rewards, I become even more indignant, feeling a surge of anger.</p>
<p>However, when I accidentally glimpsed a wounded and dying stray dog in a quiet corner, my hatred for dogs suddenly wavered.</p>
<p>Moreover, from this, I had the following feelings:</p>
<p>Perhaps in the past, it was a police dog loyal to its duties, guarding the property of a factory owner, just as young and strong workers worked hard to increase the wealth of the factory owner. When he and it had exhausted their sweat and blood, they were like sugarcane that had been squeezed dry, with only the pulp remaining, and were driven out the door without any mercy.</p>
<p>He and it are both so unfortunate with such unfortunate fates.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, there are people and dogs who reap without sowing. He enjoys the blood and sweat of others, drop by drop, doing nothing, playing with dogs and other things to relieve boredom. It is either exquisite and clever, not needing to work hard, but relying on flattering gestures to eat, drink, and play leisurely, living the life of a pampered darling of adults.</p>
<p>He and it seem to be the lucky darlings of heaven.</p>
<p>Is the fortune and misfortune of people and dogs arranged long ago? Yes, since the beginning of history, mankind has long laid the foundation for fortune and misfortune, but the arrangement is definitely not by some so-called God or Bodhisattva, but precisely by those clever, unearned darlings of heaven who are stabilizing their acquired territories.</p>
<p>From this, I became completely enlightened, and my hatred turned in another direction from then on.</p>
<h3 id="e57">A Nighttime Pilgrimage on the Streets <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— Ling Zuren</p>
<p>Night brings profound darkness, heavily pressing down on this twentieth-century city.</p>
<p>This place is no longer the city that never sleeps. The red lights that used to paint the half-covered screen with a sunset glow, and the intense headlights of cars that intertwined like the beams of searchlights, have all become relics of its former glory.</p>
<p>Therefore, the streets at night are ruled by darkness, swallowed up by it, filled with an eerie and terrifying atmosphere that replaces the various lights. The only things occupying the streets at night are the red lights atop the self-defense force guard posts, shining like the eyes of a drunkard in the darkness, appearing solemn and stern.</p>
<p>The hearts of pedestrians are gray and heavy. The sound of their footsteps is shrouded in sighs over the ruggedness of life's road.</p>
<p>The barricades at the road junctions, made of bamboo poles, squat in the darkness like ferocious beasts baring their teeth, giving pedestrians a great deal of wariness.</p>
<p>The traffic lights are merely a recollection in the minds of rickshaw pullers. The black uniforms of the Indian police and their two waving white sleeves are indeed a clear and distinct signal.</p>
<p>The sparse lights in a few shops faintly resemble fishing lights on the sea.</p>
<p>The smiles of young people have disappeared from the street corners. Those wanderers who have lost the light are trudging through the darkness in search of their homes.</p>
<p>From someone's radio floats a burst of sad melody. The desolate tune deeply stirs the heartstrings of the wanderers buried in the darkness.</p>
<p>The streets at night in a twentieth-century city are so somber and bleak.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Overcoming Difficulties <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Penglun</p>
<p>I once heard a motto from a great entrepreneur: "Ease is the crystallization of many difficulties." This sounds like commonplace platitudes, but upon careful reflection, one will feel that it has great meaning.</p>
<p>To give a very small example, sometimes when we pick up a pencil and find that its tip is inevitably blunt, we will unthinkingly take out a small knife from our pocket and lightly sharpen it a few times. Immediately, the pencil tip becomes sharp and usable again. This seems like the most ordinary thing to us now, but we must not forget that when we were children, we cut our fingers many times, broke the lead many times, and endured many failures before we achieved today's proficiency and ease.</p>
<p>Although this is a very small example, it shows that as long as we tolerate failure, then when we encounter it again in the future, we can handle it easily and solve it smoothly. A person with more skills has more foothold in society, more security in life, and is one step closer to the road to success. Therefore, "ease is the crystallization of many difficulties" can be considered a common secret of success. (Reward for scholarship)</p>
<h3 id="e59">Explanation of Work <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Dahai</p>
<p>Work is a way of being active in which people can compete with others and improve society.</p>
<p>Work can maintain life and eternal sweetness and health.</p>
<p>Work is a powerful hammer that tempers the rough iron of personality into fine steel.</p>
<p>Work can keep the minds of the elderly young in spirit.</p>
<p>Work can preserve mental and muscular strength to meet the challenges of new opportunities and responsibilities.</p>
<p>Work is the secret of success and happiness. (Reward for scholarship)</p>
<h3 id="e60">Aphorisms <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— Guang</p>
<p>A negligent person, even if he walks through the jungle, does not see firewood. (Russian proverb)</p>
<p>An ounce of joy is enough to relieve a pound of sorrow. (Fuller)</p>
<p>A person who cannot get angry is a fool; a person who does not want to get angry is a wise man. (Western proverb)</p>
<p>One today is worth two tomorrows. (Franklin)</p>

<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(9) Human Hell</p>
<p>Aying was eager to know the method that Wei Shaoyun had discussed and repeatedly asked what the method was. Wei Shaoyun said, "Go ask them." As he spoke, he pointed to Cuizhen, meaning, "How can I tell you here?" Aying then walked from the room to the outside and saw three or four people whispering in the south room. She nodded and smiled, "I know it was Little Zhuge's idea." The one called Little Zhuge was a thin-faced man with a thin, long neck that looked somewhat like a pen holder. When he ate, you could see the food going down his throat with each bite. He was under Wei Shaoyun's command but had not yet made any special achievements. He was now attaching half a cigarette butt to a cigarette, making it long, and holding it in his mouth. It was said that his wisdom always came out slowly as he smoked. He winked at Aying, his cigarette still in his mouth, and said, "The tigress has come to sit down and talk." Aying raised her fist and pretended to punch him, but missed, only causing a small piece of ash to fall on the table. He laughed, "Your husband is called Tiger Mountain, aren't you a tigress? I'm telling the truth, not daring to scold anyone." Aying sat down and said, "I haven't eaten yet. Tell me quickly what you've come up with for my brother."</p>
<p>Little Zhuge took the cigarette in his hand, puffed out his pointed mouth and thin lips, and blew a puff of air that made the ash on the table fly around, into the teacup, and onto Aying's and others' faces. Aying said, "You're really annoying. When I ask you to speak, you put on airs." Little Zhuge said, "This method is for dealing with women, and you're a woman, so you can't hear it." One of those sitting opposite Little Zhuge, acting as a mediator, hurriedly said, "Sister and Young Master Wei are siblings, and there are no outsiders here. What does it matter if you tell us?" Little Zhuge, Little Zhuge, then took a sip of hot tea and said with a smile, "This method of mine is tried and tested, a hundred times out of a hundred. Don't go bothering Miss Bian anymore, let her rest well. If she doesn't want to eat rice, then please give her congee. If she doesn't want congee, then please give her coffee and milk. If she still doesn't want it, don't force her. Don't say a word about wanting her to be a concubine or young mistress. Just wait until tonight, when the stars have turned, the night is deep and quiet." (192)</p>
