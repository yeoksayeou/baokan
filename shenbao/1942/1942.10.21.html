<h3>強固市民體魄重要事業</h3>
<h3>健康保險生活程度高疾病生不得防患未然勝於事後貽悔</h3>
<p>生活程度這樣高疾病第一生不得這差不多是每一個中下階級者所能感覺到的眞理當然自從物價飛漲以後民生大蹙靠著薪水過活的人們幸而健康還可以利用他的精神或勞力無虞飢寒假使不幸疾病相侵醫藥費實在可觀尤其是西藥一項海外交通斷絕以來有時簡直有了大洋還買不到藥呢要是再不幸病入膏肓藥石岡效一命鳴呼最起碼的靈柩非ＣＲＢ千計不可雖然不要錢的棺材有處可得但是攸關體面祇得硬著頭皮咬緊牙關來一下子在這種生活變態與經濟變態交相煎迫之下病家的疾苦可想而知而健康之重要性卻與日俱增了</p>
<p>各國保健組織一般</p>
<p>其實保障健康不能單靠醫藥界的努力眞正的保健倒在無病之時講到保健第一應注重攝生善攝生者必定健康防病於無病知病於病之未著治病說初病這三者可說是保健的中心要旨世界各國對於這些都非常注意有種種保健組織之成立所謂保健事業亦就是健康保險健康保險的組織大別可分為公共的和私家的兩種公共健康保險開始於一八七一年凡屬公務人員和職工等在薪俸內提出百分之四至六作為健康保險費有指定醫生和醫院作為保障私家的健康保險除上列人員外凡自由職業者及家庭婦女小孩等都能自由加入可以延請家庭醫師診視以德國論投保者約有二千萬人每年保費在十二萬萬馬克以上美國則達三十六萬萬元以上平均每人為三十元俄國有二十五萬萬盧布的社會保險費日本防療經費為三百萬元保健事業所費在三千萬元以上這類公共健康保險是強迫的店主或公司方面擔任保險費三分之一而由職員擔任三分之二私家保健組織完全不同即與各醫生並無特約凡私家健康保險社之社員可延請其私人醫師診視由社員自行付費於私人醫生或醫院然後再向保險機關收回</p>
<p>服務效力樹有前例</p>
<p>說得再詳細些如美國紐約醫院服務保險公司的第十萬號會員是一個完全健康的人假若他忽然生病要住院治療時雖平時所付會費極少此時就可免費住院診治三星期如期滿繼續住院仍可享受七五折的優待權利紐約城的健康保險費是廿四大規模的保健公司的模範如克利扶倫和白金漢兩城的最低保費是每月六角羅傑司脫是六角五分薩克曼陀和紐奧蘭西城是七角五分有一年五十工歲的紐約老人當最初有人勸他加入保健組織時竭力反對但入會後三星期就因極嚴重的肺炎癥送入醫院痊愈出院時醫院的賬僅二元六角又有一人失業某日跌傷甚劇送入醫院後經用Ｘ光及藥物治療住院一星期痊愈出院未費分文</p>
<p>保健社會倡導於先</p>
<p>中國有沒有同樣性質的保健組織呢有的戰前市政府與業信旗社及虹橋療養院曾分別設立上海市健康保障會及中國保健社以維護公眾健康化極少社費獲得醫藥保障為宗旨就中國保健社言凡住居上海市區內之人士及其家屬均得為該社社員照章享受醫療上種種利益平均每內社費一分六厘全年診療就可免費每日納社費一角三分住院和醫陪上一切都可免費中國保健社在那時對疾病預防十分注意所實行的有肺病癌腫花優劣眼各項檢查和一般的健康檢騐等此外社員日常生活和一切衛生方法均由該社隨時派員防問詳細指導增進社員家庭間健康和幸福</p>
<p>健康檢驗可分三種</p>
<p>提到健康檢驗就可想到它底目的是與其貽總於無窮何如未雨而綢繆中國保健社的健康檢驗工作就是由虹橋療養院所擔任的概括言之可分為三種一為生物學的檢驗各種細菌微生物的檢查血液反應等屬之二為物理學的檢驗血壓測定和愛克司光透視等是三為化學的檢驗包括檢查糖質蛋白質和胃液等現在虹橋療養院仍繼續進行的健康檢驗共有兩種一種是體格檢驗另一種是Ｘ光集團檢驗前者檢驗範圍包括全身器官尤注重於心肺等部血液痰糞便等亦經化騐後者祇是用Ｘ光檢查心肺</p>
<p>人工氣胸治肺目的</p>
<p>由肺部關想到中國患肺病者為數極多而人工氣胸之醫療方法更有提倡之必要一八三二年時詹姆士霍登姆氏曾注意一病勢沈重的肺結核患者因有自生氣胸其病漸癒五十年後福來尼尼氏就報告將空氣注入胸膜腔內可以治療肺結核惟尚未實行至一九○六年方有人工氣胸治療之病倒報告在施行人工氣胸之前須先用Ｘ光透視肺部以知其病象程度然後用針刺入胸膜腔再視其呼吸時之壓力注入適當量之空氣人工氣胸在醫療上的目的有五（一）使有病之肺停止動作由是而得局部之休息（二）減少肺部之緊張力以利其疾病在病理上轉癒時之收縮患肺結核者經施行人工氣胸後肺臓即減低其緊張力同時其疾病點亦可得病理上收縮之便利（三）有病之肺部因被迫壓縮寬洞得以消失（四）緩和淋巴之循環使其減少運輸結核毒素入血之機會由是全身病狀亦可隨之而癒（五）病者經治療至痰中無結核菌後可使其疾病不再散佈至身體其他部分如喉及腸等同時不再散佈至其餘的健全肺部份</p>
<p>聽說最近各界領袖發起組織中國保健股份有限公司聯合各大醫院療養院試騐所藥房藥廠樹立一醫療服務的中心一旦成立將推行防癆運動普及健康檢查和舉辦健康保險等在保險公司如雨後春筍紛紛設立的今日再來一下健康保險倒是當務之急吧</p>

<h3>Stalin City Residential Area Completely Flattened, Northwest Red Army Prepares Counter-Offensive, Fierce Fighting Day and Night in Western Caucasus</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 20th, Havas News Agency</p>
<p>According to unofficial sources today, there have been no major changes in the Stalin City battle situation in the past day. German troops are busy clearing out the remaining enemy forces in the occupied areas. Simultaneously, they have set up artillery batteries on the right bank of the Volga River, seemingly not attacking the October Revolution factories. However, German official sources claim that the encircled Soviet forces there are in a precarious situation, as the German army controls the Volga River area around Stalin City. Reinforcements crossing the river are impossible. The residential areas inside Stalin City have been completely flattened, with not a single house undamaged. According to German aerial reconnaissance reports, German forces are concentrating again in the northwest of Stalin City, equipped with tanks and artillery. However, there is no indication whether General Timoshenko, the commander of the Soviet Southern Front, has taken the offensive against German positions on the Don and Volga Rivers. Since Sunday, Stalin City and its suburbs have been experiencing torrential rain, but the German forces' mopping-up operations within the city have not been hindered.</p>
<p>Hitler's Headquarters, 20th, Huitong News Agency</p>
<p>This afternoon, the German military communiqué stated that several enemy blockhouses in the mountainous woodland area of western Caucasus were destroyed by our forces. Our forces advancing simultaneously from the north and south met on the mountain roads leading to Tuapse. An enemy counterattack in the Terek region was repelled. In the northern suburbs of Stalingrad, German forces captured more houses defended by Soviet troops. The remaining enemy forces in the Red Barracks and artillery factory area are being cleared. German aircraft heavily bombed the most heavily defended points of the October Revolution factories. A tugboat on the lower Volga River, six airplanes parked on the ground, and several freight trains were destroyed by German aircraft. Romanian troops fighting on the Don River repelled an attacking enemy force.</p>
<p>Moscow, 19th, Havas News Agency</p>
<p>The local radio station just announced that enemy infantry, under the cover of tanks, occupied a certain area of Stalin City after suffering heavy losses. The German side lost 18 tanks and left behind hundreds of bodies in this battle. Simultaneously, our forces continued to operate in the northwest of Stalin City, capturing five enemy blockhouses. Three enemy attacks failed. In the area beyond Bryansk, the enemy's attempt to break through our lines has failed. German infantry, under artillery cover, launched a fierce attack on our positions but were repelled to their original positions after our counterattack.</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th, Havas News Agency</p>
<p>Although the fighting northwest of Stalin City has been quiet in recent days, [illegible] Sheikdom is launching a large-scale counterattack.</p>
<p>Ankara, 20th, Huitong News Agency</p>
<p>This morning, Moscow Radio reported that in the western Caucasus region, fighting occurred day and night. Allied forces were forced to abandon two positions and one important high ground. Berlin, 20th, Huitong News Agency</p>
<p>German forces in the western Caucasus, aiming to attack the port of Tuapse on the Black Sea coast, face fierce fighting north and south of the port. Soviet troops are using the mountainous terrain to build defenses, making it difficult to advance. German forces often launch surprise attacks on Soviet troops in concealed locations at dusk, dawn, or in foggy weather, engaging in hand-to-hand combat to capture Soviet fortresses. Soviet troops are striving to defend, not fearing sacrifice. During counterattacks, they set fire to forests, using the thick smoke as cover.</p>
<h3>Commencement Ceremony of the Third Term of the Military Officer Training Corps, Corps Commander Wang Attends and Delivers Instructions</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 20th, Central News Agency</p>
<p>The third term of students of the Central Army Military Officer Training Corps held its commencement ceremony at the corps headquarters at 9:00 AM on the 20th. Corps Commander Wang attended and delivered instructions, roughly stating that nation-building requires army-building, and army-building must first improve the quality of soldiers. With improved soldier quality, the foundation of army-building is consolidated, and then the expansion of the number of soldiers can be pursued. Since the return to the capital, the National Government and commanders of various units have advocated for elite troops. All officers put aside their important tasks and valuable time to receive training at the corps. The purpose is none other than to realize the concept of elite troops. There are three key points to implementing the elite troops concept. First, we must clearly identify our goal, which is to revive China and East Asia, fundamentally eliminating the communist scourge. This military goal is very consistent and clear. Second, responsibilities must be clear. Military force used correctly can save the country and its people, but used incorrectly, it can harm the country and its people. The military must strictly observe discipline, with tight organization. Without discipline, it is not only equal to having no army, but worse than having no army. To truly achieve strict discipline and tight organization, responsibilities must be clearly defined. Third, we must strengthen our ability to take on responsibility. A North American military textbook has a very poignant statement: one cannon with 100% accuracy is equal to one hundred cannons with 1% accuracy. This shows that only with ability can we use weapons, otherwise, even with excellent mechanical combat equipment, it is futile. In this short month, you must first receive training, first achieving the elite troops concept yourself. When you return to your units in the future, you must train your subordinates and encourage your colleagues. You must all strive in the corps to first achieve spiritual unity, and then expand this spirit to all the troops. In this way, on a small scale, comprehensive peace can be achieved, and on a large scale, we can work together to complete the Great East Asia War and fulfill the important responsibility of reviving China and protecting East Asia. I wish to encourage myself with this, and to encourage you all together.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Executive Yuan Meeting</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 20th, Central News Agency</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan held its 133rd meeting on the 20th, chaired by President Wang.

Resolved: To be reviewed jointly by Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Finance, Minister Chen of the Ministry of Interior, Minister Mei of the Ministry of Industry, Secretary-General Chen of the National Economic Council, and Director Zou of the Senate Hall, convened by Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>Willkie to Deliver Radio Address</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 20th, Huitong News Agency</p>
<p>According to news from here last night, Willkie has left Washington for the American Midwest in order to prepare to deliver a radio address to the American people about his impressions of the Soviet Union, the Near East, and China.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 20th, Huitong News Agency</p>
<p>The New York Daily News reports that informed sources say Willkie plans to form a new political party in the United States called the Liberty Party. Although Willkie is a Republican, the party has no shortage of harsh criticisms of Willkie's gaffes, so Willkie has the desire to strike out on his own.</p>

<h3>African Storm Gathers, Smuts Returns to London to Continue Talks with Churchill, to Deliver Speech in Parliament</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 20th, Reuters</p>
<p>According to reports from London, South African Prime Minister Smuts is continuing talks with Churchill. Smuts spent the weekend in the countryside and returned to London yesterday. He is preparing his speeches for the House of Commons and the House of Lords.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Huitong News Agency</p>
<p>[From] London [comes] news that South African Prime Minister Smuts spent his weekend in the countryside to complete his speech to be delivered in the House of Commons soon. At that time, his speech will be broadcast by various British radio stations. Smuts returned to London yesterday.</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th, Havas News Agency</p>
<p>The Deutsche Nachrichtenagentur's diplomatic correspondent recently telegraphed that South African Prime Minister General Smuts is currently conducting negotiations in London. Smuts may take the opportunity to raise some military and political issues related to both the United States and South Africa. Smuts is known to favor the most powerful side and is well aware of the United States' planned Greater South African Empire. At this time, Smuts' desire to please the United States seems to be greater than his desire to please Britain. The reason Smuts is consulting with the United States is probably here.</p>
<p>British Newspapers Reveal African Offensive</p>
<p>Stockholm, 20th, Huitong News Agency</p>
<p>British newspapers revealed that the African offensive plan jointly drafted by Britain and the United States will be fully completed before South African Prime Minister Smuts leaves Britain next week. British newspapers believe that Smuts is unlikely to travel to Washington via London to meet with President Roosevelt. British newspapers commented on the landing of American troops in Liberia, saying that the relationship between this matter and future wars cannot be predicted.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 20th, Huitong News Agency</p>
<p>London Electric News, the British Observer, said that the Allied powers are about to launch a major military action in Africa. This remark has aroused comments from various British newspapers. The military correspondent of the Daily Telegraph said that there is no doubt that the Allied forces will launch a decisive military action in Africa at any time. The landing of Allied troops in Liberia and other places on the West African coast is related to the upcoming war in North Africa, but the correspondent did not discuss this point. Many British people believe that the occupation of Liberia is to protect Allied sea and land transport to the Near East and the Persian Gulf. This has great significance for the British and American winter war plans.</p>
<p>Darlan to North Africa to Meet French Generals</p>
<p>Vichy, 20th, Huitong News Agency</p>
<p>It is reported that French Commander-in-Chief Admiral Darlan has departed for Algiers. Political figures strongly state that this trip is purely private because his son is serving as a naval officer in Algiers and is currently ill. His wife went to Algiers a few days ago. However, Darlan may take the opportunity to discuss with North African French generals the various defensive measures that need to be taken given the current landing of American troops in Liberia.</p>
<p>Vichy, 20th, Huitong News Agency</p>
<p>General Pétain met with various dignitaries yesterday and was very busy.

<p>British and Americans Building Roads in Africa</p>
<p>Lisbon, 20th, Huitong News Agency</p>
<p>Recently, informed sources from neutral countries who arrived here from Africa stated that the British African colonies anticipate that the British and Americans will attack French West Africa during the dry season from late October to May of next year. The British and Americans are currently busy preparing and building their so-called African Burma Road. This road is composed of five strategic highways connecting the west coast of Africa with Egypt. Two of the roads, one from Lagos via Lamy Fortress to Khartoum and one from Douala via Stanleyville to Khartoum, are longer than China's Burma Road. To transport the cargo carried by a medium-sized cargo ship via the above two routes would require about 1,500 trucks and would take several weeks. Therefore, three other routes are being built. Western African ports such as Bathurst, Freetown, Monrovia, Lagos, Douala, Libreville, etc., are all between 4,000 and 5,000 kilometers from Khartoum. It is impossible to travel this long distance without sufficient gasoline. It is now heard that the British and Americans plan to use camels to carry gasoline to various stations along the way to avoid the risk of running out of gasoline midway.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th, Huitong News Agency</p>
<p>A German Foreign Ministry spokesman said yesterday that the landing of American troops in Liberia is tantamount to exposing the other side's mask. Berlin was not surprised at all. Roosevelt often disregards the provisions of the Atlantic Charter and arbitrarily invades small and weak countries according to his own will.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 20th, Huitong News Agency</p>
<p>The London Observer said yesterday that most people believe that the landing of American troops in Liberia is exciting news. In fact, the concentration of Allied troops in Africa is enough to weaken the strength of other theaters. This war cannot be decided in Africa, but only in Europe. If an offensive is to be launched, it should be launched in Europe.</p>
<p>Bern, 19th, Havas News Agency</p>
<p>According to news from Berlin, the news of the landing of American troops in the West African black republic of Liberia was reprinted in German newspapers today. The semi-official diplomatic and political newsletter of the Foreign Ministry also wrote an article commenting on it, stating briefly that any small country, if coveted by Churchill or Roosevelt for unfounded reasons, cannot protect itself. This is further proof of the Liberia matter. Washington claims that after the Allied victory in the future, they will carry out reconstruction according to the principles of democracy and lend-lease. Only fools would believe it. We know very well that the United States intends to distribute the world's resources with one hand. In short, President Roosevelt intends to control world trade and use the United States to control the prices of the world market. At the same time, German diplomatic and political figures do not express surprise at the news of the landing of American troops in Liberia. They are now paying attention to the evolution of the military and political situation in Africa in the next few days, because the English newspapers have repeatedly reported rumors about the establishment of submarine bases by French West Africa's Dakar Port and Germany on the African coast.</p>
<h3>Hori Warns Japan to Prepare for Long-Term War, Second Front Not Limited to Europe, War Has Entered New Stage</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd, Allied News Agency</p>
<p>Information Bureau spokesman Hori broadcast to the nation last night that the planned second front of Britain and the United States is not limited to Europe, but also includes the Pacific and Africa. In the Pacific, the United States may take the form of a general counterattack against Japan. Hori also warned the entire nation of Japan that the American authorities have recognized Japan's true strength and are now using all their strength to step up the manufacture of military equipment and ammunition in preparation for a long-term war. The war has now entered a new stage and is gradually becoming a long-term war in nature. The first ten months of the Great East Asia War were only its beginning. The Japanese nation should respond with all its strength.</p>

<h3>Britain and the United States Agree in Principle to Organize Supreme Committee</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 20th, Central News Agency</p>
<p>According to news from Chongqing, Foreign Minister Song Ziwen of Chongqing will soon depart from Washington to return to Chongqing. While he was in Washington, he proposed that democratic countries such as Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union organize a supreme committee of the anti-Axis United Nations to extensively agree in principle on the implementation of relations during and after the war. In addition, the committee plans to include the heads of state of various anti-Axis countries and powerful figures in the political world, and to have Roosevelt, Churchill, and Chiang Kai-shek as standing committee members to unify the strategic steps of various countries in the war against the Axis powers, so that they can be interconnected and closely connected. However, it is currently unclear what the Soviet Union's opinion is on this matter. Most political figures in Chongqing believe that if the large joint organization is realized, whether its functions can be fully utilized is still questionable. It is also rumored that another plan is to organize a special committee under the Supreme Committee to mediate the Indian issue.</p>

<p>Associate of the Cabinet Michael Antonescu delivered a speech at a workers' meeting in the city of Barasov in the province of Outer Transylvania today, stating briefly that at this point in time, the privileges [illegible] no longer exist, and work is the only source of wealth. If we do not want to be slaves in our own territory and want to consolidate our position on both sides of the Carpathian Mountains, the Doria River, and the Black Sea coast, then we must recognize that only under the condition that continuous work supports the soldiers fighting on the front lines can we realize this wish. Hungary and Romania are in dispute over the sovereignty of the province of Outer Transylvania. Neither side will give in. Hungarian Prime Minister Kere recently gave a speech in Ungvár, saying that Hungary has recovered its lost territory and will never lose it again, seemingly positioning itself as the leader of the Carpathian Mountains.</p>

<h3>Portuguese Newspaper Reviews Current European Political Situation</h3>
<p>The well-known "Manha" newspaper in this area recently published an article reviewing the current European political situation. The article stated that the most significant fact of the past week is that the Soviet Union is independently resisting the German forces and anxiously hopes for the speedy opening of a second front, leading to increasing disagreement with its allies. However, it seems to have forgotten its own attitude when the second front existed, i.e., before the defeat of France. At that time, it joined hands with Germany, only wanting to obtain the necessary peace to safely digest the Polish territory it had occupied by dishonorable means. The United States is now adopting a realistic attitude, deeply aware that if the Soviet Union is left to its own devices and is not saved, it will inevitably lead to isolation and trouble in the future. Therefore, the U.S. government is eager to take more decisive action, but it is still difficult to take effective military action because preparations are insufficient. Britain still maintains its traditional wait-and-see policy, unwilling to take risky actions that would jeopardize its entire future. In addition, the military command must be unified before the second front is opened, but the time is not yet ripe. We often see diplomatic personnel and government officials from various countries actively trying to solve this difficulty, but they keep their missions secret and only make vague statements indicating that they have no important tasks.</p>

<h3>Silver and Banking Industries Make Efforts to Promote Commercial Acceptance Bills to Facilitate Trade and Restore Inherent Commercial Credit; Industries Can Enter into Acceptance Contracts with Banks</h3>
<p>To facilitate the trade of goods and restore inherent commercial credit, the silver and banking industries are promoting commercial acceptance bills. Banks and financial institutions are willing to discount commercial acceptance bills, and leading banks are also willing to rediscount them. Commercial acceptance bills are issued by the seller upon delivering goods to the buyer, specifying payment within a certain number of days after sight. The bill is sent to the buyer for signature and acceptance. Before the bill's maturity, the seller can seek a guarantor and request the bank to discount the bill. The discounting bank will collect the payment from the buyer (the acceptor) on the maturity date. If the commercial credit of the buyer's accepted bill is relatively poor, the seller or the buyer can enter into an acceptance contract with the bank, using the goods being traded as collateral, allowing the seller to have the bank accept and discount the forward bill. To prevent speculators from taking advantage, banks will pay attention to the process by which the bill is issued, such as bills issued by manufacturers and accepted by wholesalers, or bills issued by wholesalers and accepted by retailers, as the process will be smoother and reduce potential abuses. The following is an abstract of the proposed acceptance contract:</p>
<p>Providing Collateral</p>
<p>The acceptance contract stipulates: (1) The drawer issues the remittance for the sole purpose of paying a certain party. (2) The maturity date of the bill issued by the drawer is limited to a maximum of a certain number of days. (3) The drawer shall deposit the funds into your bank a few days before the maturity date of the bill for payment, without fail. (4) The acceptance fee is calculated at a certain percentage per mille of the face amount and shall be paid by the drawer upon each request for acceptance. (5) Your bank may notify the drawer at any time to stop accepting or reduce the limit, which the drawer agrees to comply with. (6) If the value of the collateral falls below the market price at the time of the agreement, the drawer shall immediately increase or replace the collateral to compensate for the reduced value, at least to the extent required to make up the difference. (7) Your bank shall not be responsible for any loss of the collateral due to material deterioration, quantity shortage, or damage caused by natural disasters or other force majeure events. The drawer shall replace the collateral with equivalent value. (8) The type and quantity of collateral to be replaced or added by the drawer must be approved by your bank.</p>
<p>Supplemental Payment</p>
<p>(9) The collateral shall be insured by the drawer with a fire insurance policy in your bank's name (or with your bank as the priority beneficiary) with an insurance company approved by your bank at the market value. If your bank deems it necessary to add war insurance or other types of insurance, the drawer agrees to comply. All formal insurance policies and premium receipts shall be submitted to your bank for safekeeping, and the premium shall be borne by the drawer. In case of an accident, your bank is entitled to receive compensation directly from the insurance company to offset the amount advanced by your bank. If the compensation is insufficient, the drawer shall make a supplemental payment. If your bank deems it necessary to provide additional collateral before receiving the compensation, the drawer agrees to comply. If the insurance company refuses to pay the compensation for any reason, or if the compensation is insufficient, it shall not be the responsibility of your bank, and the drawer shall make a supplemental payment of equivalent collateral or cash. (10) If the drawer fails to promptly insure the items in the previous clause, your bank may handle the insurance on its behalf, and all expenses shall be borne by the drawer. However, your bank has no obligation to handle the insurance. (11) Documents such as warehouse receipts and bills of lading shall be endorsed by the drawer for the purpose of establishing a pledge, and the documents shall be transferred to your bank's account. Your bank shall be entitled to retrieve or inspect the contents of the goods at any time, and the drawer shall not object. All procedures, including transportation, customs clearance, and taxes and fees for storage and sealing, shall be handled by the drawer.</p>
<p>Bank Rights</p>
<p>(12) If the drawer fails to perform any of the conditions stipulated in this contract or if your bank believes that there is a risk of non-performance, your bank may demand that the drawer immediately repay all amounts advanced and paid. Otherwise, interest shall be calculated at the specified rate, and your bank may freely dispose of the collateral deposited by the drawer to offset the debt and all expenses required for the disposal. If the drawer has other assets in your bank, they may also be used to offset the outstanding amount. All receipts and certificates issued by your bank shall be invalidated immediately. If the proceeds are insufficient to offset the debt, the drawer shall be responsible for making up the difference. If there is a surplus, your bank may use it to offset any other outstanding debts of the drawer to your bank, whether due or not. (13) The guarantor shall be fully liable for the conditions stated in this contract if the drawer fails to perform or is deemed unable to perform for any reason. The guarantor agrees to waive the right of defense under Article 724, Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code and the rights under Article 745 of the same code. (14) The guarantor shall not self-guarantee, but the drawer shall immediately replace the guarantor if your bank notifies the drawer to do so. (15) This contract shall be valid from a certain date in a certain month of a certain year to a certain date in a certain month of a certain year.</p>
<p>Guarantor Liability</p>
<p>Anyone requesting a discount must provide a letter of guarantee, stating that the discounter is discounting commercial acceptance bills successively or cyclically with your bank for a specified period and for a discount amount of a certain number of yuan. Within this period and amount, if the bill is not paid on maturity, the guarantor shall be jointly and severally liable, waiving the right of defense, and shall immediately repay all amounts discounted or advanced by your bank, including fees and interest. Regarding the procedures for commercial discounting: (1) Any commercial firm or factory holding an accepted bill shall submit an application to this bank for discounting. (2) If this bank deems the application qualified, it shall notify the applicant to complete the discounting procedures. (3) The discount rate and the discount amount shall be negotiated between the applicant and this bank at any time. (4) The discounted bill shall be endorsed and transferred to this bank. (5) If the bill is not paid on maturity, this bank may exercise the right of recourse against any one of the drawer, endorser, and guarantor. (6) After the bill is paid on maturity, this bank shall return the bill to the payer.</p>

<h3>Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama Talks About Punishing American Airmen</h3>
<p>The Allied Press reports from this port. Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama, spokesman for the Japanese Army Press Department, stated yesterday (Tuesday) during a press conference that the severe punishment of inhumane enemy airmen is in accordance with the Japanese Bushido, and those who commit cruel and barbaric crimes will not be treated with leniency. Mr. Yokoyama strongly criticized the enemy's propaganda using the word "Bushido" to achieve its own goals, saying that the enemy's propaganda quoting Bushido shows that Bushido is only practiced by the Japanese. The condolence telegram received from San Francisco radio station on April 16 reported that American prisoners of war were treated favorably in Japan. At that time, I warned my superiors that this broadcast should be treated with caution. Two days later, American bombers flew to Japan, and I personally saw them strafing schoolchildren. Therefore, we can only feel resentment towards the enemy's inhumane behavior using the name of Bushido. The purpose of our condolence telegram and the San Francisco broadcast was to make American airmen not believe that they would be killed if captured after bombing Japan. This fact is sufficient to show that the enemy violates the principles of Bushido. Based on my previous experience in Vietnam, when the Japanese army was about to enter Vietnam, Britain, the United States, and Chongqing colluded with the then Governor-General of Indochina to prevent the Japanese army's actions and made great propaganda, claiming that the large number of military supplies transported to Chongqing via Vietnam was all unfounded. They also repeatedly stated that the Japanese army's entry into Vietnam violated Bushido. Furthermore, at that time, British Ambassador to Japan Grew and the American and French ambassadors all argued to Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke that the Japanese army's entry into Vietnam violated the principles of Bushido. At that time, I personally witnessed this false propaganda in Vietnam, because military supplies were piled up everywhere, and they were all being transported to Chongqing via Yunnan and Guangxi.</p>

<h3>Final Report (4) Conclusions and Recommendations on French Concession Defense Exercises</h3>
<p>The results of the air defense exercises in the Shanghai French Concession are very satisfactory and meet the expectations of the Japanese authorities responsible for air defense in Shanghai. However, there are still many points that need to be improved, such as concealing lights and general discipline, which residents should conscientiously comply with. Regarding the concealment of lights, attention should be paid to places such as bathrooms, kitchens, corridors, etc., which are easily overlooked in general exercises because they are not used. Some residents only conceal lights in one room and ignore other rooms. This method is very bad, because when the exercise time is extended, people in the room will inevitably have to go to a certain room or a certain room to take necessary items. In addition, residents often neglect the windows of small courtyards and gardens of houses. They think that as long as the indoor lights do not leak out to pedestrians, the concealment measures are perfect, but they do not know that their lights can sometimes be seen by people looking down from a high place. Therefore, special attention must be paid to small windows and small openings facing the sky, which must be turned off or carefully covered. Also, residents do not seem to fully understand the meaning of the various exercises. Currently, there are two types of exercises: one is an alarm exercise, and the other is an air raid exercise.</p>

<h3>Ink Sea Hall Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>Our country's calligraphy and famous paintings are a characteristic of oriental culture and occupy an important position in the world of art. The famous works handed down from generation to generation have been eagerly sought after by emperors, nobles, and elegant scholars of past dynasties. However, as time has passed and the vicissitudes of life have changed, it is inevitable that genuine works have been lost. Nowadays, there are few remaining and they are not easy to obtain. The owner of Ink Sea Hall has been collecting ancient and modern masters' genuine works for many years, numbering no less than several thousand pieces, and it can be guaranteed that there are no imitations. A special exhibition will be held on the fourth floor of the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association to share them with the public.</p>

<h3>Strengthening Citizens' Physique is an Important Undertaking</h3>
<h3>Health Insurance: High Standard of Living, Illness Cannot Be Afforded, Prevention is Better Than Regret</h3>
<p>With such a high standard of living, one simply cannot afford to get sick. This is a truth felt by almost everyone in the lower and middle classes. Of course, since the soaring prices, people's livelihood has been greatly affected. Those who live on salaries are fortunate to be healthy and can use their spirit or labor without fear of hunger and cold. If unfortunately, they are afflicted with illness, the medical expenses are considerable, especially for Western medicine. Since the interruption of overseas transportation, sometimes even with a large ocean, you still can't buy medicine. If it is even more unfortunate that the illness is incurable and medicine is ineffective, then at least the most basic coffin costs thousands of CRB, even though there are free coffins available, but for the sake of dignity, one has to grit their teeth and bite the bullet. Under this combination of life abnormality and economic abnormality, the suffering of the sick family can be imagined, and the importance of health is increasing day by day.</p>
<p>General Health Organizations in Various Countries</p>
<p>In fact, ensuring health cannot rely solely on the efforts of the medical community. True health lies in preventing illness. When it comes to health, the first thing to pay attention to is health preservation. Those who are good at health preservation will definitely be healthy, preventing disease before it occurs, knowing the disease when it is not yet obvious, and treating the disease when it is in its early stages. These three can be said to be the central tenets of health preservation. All countries in the world pay great attention to these, and various health organizations have been established. The so-called health undertakings are health insurance. Health insurance organizations can be broadly divided into public and private. Public health insurance began in 1871. All civil servants and employees contribute 4% to 6% of their salaries as health insurance fees, with designated doctors and hospitals as guarantees. In addition to the above-mentioned personnel, private health insurance is open to freelancers, housewives, children, and others who can join freely. They can hire family doctors for consultation. In Germany, there are about 20 million insured people, with annual premiums exceeding 1.2 billion marks. In the United States, the figure reaches 360 million yuan, averaging 30 yuan per person. Russia has 2.5 billion rubles of social insurance premiums, and Japan's disease prevention expenditure is 3 million yuan, with health undertakings costing more than 30 million yuan. This type of public health insurance is mandatory, with the employer or company bearing one-third of the insurance premium and the employees bearing two-thirds. Private health organizations are completely different, and there is no special agreement with any doctors. Members of private health insurance societies can hire their private doctors for consultation and pay the fees to the private doctors or hospitals themselves, and then recover the fees from the insurance agency.</p>
<p>Service Effectiveness Has Precedent</p>
<p>To explain in more detail, such as member number 100,000 of the New York Hospital Service Insurance Company, who is a completely healthy person. If he suddenly falls ill and needs to be hospitalized, although he usually pays very little in membership fees, he can be hospitalized and treated for free for three weeks at this time. If he continues to be hospitalized after the expiry date, he can still enjoy a 25% discount. The health insurance fee in New York City is a model for 24 large-scale health companies. The lowest premiums in the two cities of Cleveland and Buckingham are six jiao per month, Rogers Trott is six jiao five fen, and Sacramento and New Orleans are seven jiao five fen. An elderly man in New York, 50 years old, strongly opposed joining the health organization when someone first persuaded him to join, but three weeks after joining, he was sent to the hospital due to severe pneumonia. When he was discharged from the hospital, the hospital bill was only two yuan and six jiao. Another person was unemployed and fell badly one day. After being sent to the hospital, he was treated with X-rays and drugs and was hospitalized for a week. He was discharged without spending a penny.</p>
<p>Health Society Advocated in the Beginning</p>
<p>Does China have similar health organizations? Yes, before the war, the municipal government, the Yexin Qishe, and the Hongqiao Sanatorium separately established the Shanghai Health Security Association and the China Health Society to maintain public health, aiming to obtain medical security with minimal membership fees. Taking the China Health Society as an example, all persons and their families residing in the Shanghai urban area can become members of the society and enjoy various medical benefits in accordance with the regulations. On average, the membership fee is one fen and six li per month, and all consultations can be free of charge. Paying a membership fee of one jiao and three fen per day can make hospitalization and all medical expenses free. The China Health Society paid great attention to disease prevention at that time, implementing various examinations for lung disease, cancer, venereal diseases, and eye diseases, as well as general health checkups. In addition, the society sent personnel to visit members' daily life and hygiene methods at any time to provide detailed guidance to enhance the health and happiness of members' families.</p>
<p>Health Checkups Can Be Divided into Three Types</p>
<p>Speaking of health checkups, one can think of its purpose: rather than regretting it endlessly, it is better to prepare for a rainy day. The health checkup work of the China Health Society was undertaken by the Hongqiao Sanatorium. Generally speaking, it can be divided into three types: one is biological examination, which includes various bacterial and microbial examinations, blood reactions, etc.; the second is physical examination, which includes blood pressure measurement and X-ray fluoroscopy; and the third is chemical examination, which includes examination of sugar, protein, and gastric juice. The Hongqiao Sanatorium is still continuing two types of health checkups: one is physical examination, and the other is X-ray group examination. The former examination covers the whole body organs, especially focusing on the heart and lungs. Blood, sputum, feces, etc. are also examined chemically. The latter only uses X-rays to examine the heart and lungs.</p>
<p>Artificial Pneumothorax Aims to Treat the Lungs</p>
<p>From the lungs, we think of the large number of people in China suffering from lung diseases, and it is necessary to promote the medical method of artificial pneumothorax. In 1832, James Holden M.D. noticed that a patient with severe tuberculosis gradually recovered due to spontaneous pneumothorax. Fifty years later, Forlanini reported that injecting air into the pleural cavity could treat tuberculosis, but it was not yet implemented. It was not until 1906 that there was a report of the disease being cured by artificial pneumothorax. Before performing artificial pneumothorax, the lungs must first be fluoroscoped with X-rays to know the extent of the disease. Then, a needle is inserted into the pleural cavity, and an appropriate amount of air is injected according to the pressure during breathing. The purpose of artificial pneumothorax in medical treatment is fivefold: (1) To make the diseased lung stop moving, thereby achieving local rest. (2) To reduce the tension of the lungs to facilitate the contraction of the disease during pathological recovery. After patients with tuberculosis have undergone artificial pneumothorax, the tension of the lungs is reduced, and the disease points can also be pathologically contracted. (3) The cavities in the diseased lungs can be eliminated due to forced compression. (4) To slow down the circulation of the lymph, reducing the chance of transporting tuberculous toxins into the blood, thereby healing the systemic symptoms as well. (5) After the patient has been treated until there are no tubercle bacilli in the sputum, the disease can no longer be spread to other parts of the body, such as the throat and intestines, and at the same time, it will no longer be spread to the remaining healthy parts of the lungs.</p>
<p>It is said that recently, leaders from all walks of life have initiated the organization of China Health Co., Ltd., uniting major hospitals, sanatoriums, testing institutes, pharmacies, and pharmaceutical factories to establish a medical service center. Once established, it will promote anti-tuberculosis campaigns, popularize health checkups, and organize health insurance. In today's society, where insurance companies are springing up like mushrooms after rain, health insurance is an urgent need.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Dashin and other jewelry stores in the city maintained the listed price of 2,550 yuan per tael of gold ornaments (purchases were reduced by about 300 yuan). The inter-dealer price had stopped rising and tended to fluctuate. In the morning, it was 2,340 yuan, the same as the noon price of the previous day, and then briefly dropped slightly by 30 yuan to 2,310 yuan. However, it soon rose again, and the noon price was 2,335 yuan, 5 yuan less than the previous day, with a difference of 30 yuan. Trading was thin. Finally, at 2,340 yuan, it was 20 to 30 yuan less than the final price of the previous day. The listed price of patterned silver ornaments was still 14 yuan per tael, and the inter-dealer price was 13 yuan and 3 yuan and 2 jiao as the entry and exit price for operators. Yesterday, the Public Association of Money Dealers did not change the discount rate and still listed it at 1 jiao and 4 fen.</p>
<p>Yesterday, military tickets suddenly strengthened. The sales price at the front door of the silver shop and small money house was 5 yuan 5 jiao 6 fen, and the purchase price was 4 fen and a half and 5 fen, which was quite different. The inter-dealer price was 5 yuan 5 jiao 5 fen 57 li as the entry and exit price, slightly rising, which was also the result of sugar merchants joining together.</p>
<h3>Commercial Briefs</h3>

<h3>Talking About the Drama of Fullness and Defect (Part Two)</h3>
<p>From the Evolution of Kunqu and Yiyang Opera to the Script of "Selling Horses"</p>
<p>The Chuichang tunes heard in Peking opera seem to be mostly in martial plays, which shows that most of the martial plays are adapted from Yiyang opera. If you want to choose a civil play that purely sings Chuichang, it seems that only "Selling Horses" exists. It is said that Zhu Suyun was the first northern actor to sing this play, but naturally we must promote Mei Wanhua, who sang it so famously that everyone, women and children, knew it. I still remember the first time I saw Mei's performance, it was a single-character play, Xiao Liwu, with Li Shoushan playing Li Qi, Jiang Miaoxiang playing Zhao Chong, Xiao Changhua playing Grandpa Hu, and Zhang Chunyan playing Li Baotong. This is a bit of a cross-dressing. Anyway, the supporting roles have to do everything and cannot care about the distinction between Laosheng and Xiaosheng.</p>
<p>The play usually performed is only four acts: "Crying in Prison," "Writing the Petition," "Three Pulls for Reunion," and "Reunion." The original name is "Qi Shuang Hui." In the 39th volume of the "Xikao" published by the Zhonghua Library, the first half of the play is printed, and the second half is arranged in the 40th volume. However, it is not Chuichang but smoothly flows. The play "Upward Drive and Soaring Energy" must be a rewritten version of the "Qi Shuang Hui" by the playwriting gentleman. Logically, the first half, called "Losing the City and Prison," is very suitable. If the entire play is performed, it seems better to use "Selling Horses" as it is more complete. Unfortunately, my eyesight is too poor and I have never seen the entire performance.</p>
<p>In addition to the "Xikao" record, I have also seen the script of the Experimental District in the second collection of "Xidian." Only the last four acts differ somewhat in content from the "Xikao," but compared to the "Jiahua Station," it is slightly better than the "Xikao." Recently, thanks to my friend Mao Zipei, who sent me a copy of the "Selling Horses" from the Forbidden City, which is complete with Gongche and gongs and drums, and the wording is also better than the two types I have seen before. It can truly be called a definitive edition. Sun Hengyi, a famous Kunqu opera fan, printed it for his birthday. He is willing to make such a precious court original public to the like-minded. This is enough to show his extraordinary mind. (Note: This script is sold by Saoyeshanfang, and the price per copy is ten yuan. The entire book is printed from zinc plates and is very eye-catching.)</p>
<h3>Explaining "Qi Bu Wen Tan" (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>Beautiful women are the cause of trouble, so Daji was executed to punish Zhou, and Xishi was sunk in Wu. The beauty of women can bewitch Yangcheng and enchant Xia Cai. Men are closely surrounded by warriors whose achievements are perfect, and they will definitely seek women to vent their great desires. Once they encounter a beautiful woman, they unconsciously enter her shell. Heroes find it difficult to overcome the barrier of beautiful women, and treacherous heroes also find it difficult to overcome the cold. It was Diao Chan's scheme that eliminated the two evils of Dong Zhuo and Lu Bu with Qiao Qi Chang's father and son. Wang Yun's chain scheme was brilliant, so it is endlessly enjoyable to substitute for the play. The play "Fengyi Pavilion" is often performed in opera troupes, and there is a Lian Yiliu in the Yuan Dynasty that serves as the blueprint for "Fengyi Pavilion." In the early Qing Dynasty, there was "Dingchi Chunqiu" as a palace performance series of plays. The civil servants who were specially compiled by imperial decree are the full version of the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms". The entire play is Kunqu opera, starting from the Oath of the Peach Garden to the Discussion of Swords (Wang Yun summoned Cao Cao to discuss swords, secretly plotting to assassinate Dong Zhuo, Cao Cao was willing to take on the task, and Yun gave him a treasure sword). Dedicating the Sword (Cao Cao used the dedication of the sword as a cause to assassinate Zhuo. When the matter failed, he fled), Releasing Cao (Cao Cao was captured in Zhongmu. The county magistrate Chen Gong had the episode of meeting Lu and not killing Lu, which is different from the current skin note version), Qi Bu Wen Tan, Three Battles, Worshipping the Moon, Small Banquet, Large Banquet, Giving the Crown, and Throwing the Battle (Wang Yun and Cao Cao conspired to assassinate Zhuo, and the plan failed and saw the family prostitute Diao Chan worshipping the moon, feeling worried about the country. Yun thought that the girl was destined to perform the chain scheme and then succeeded. This play consists of more than ninety episodes, and it takes about a dozen days to perform the series, which is really a grand view). During the Tongguang period, Beijing's Sanqing Garden performed the full version of "Romance of the Three Kingdoms", imitating the Kunqu opera version of the Qing Palace and turning it into a skin note play with additions and deletions. Some people said that it was compiled by Lu Yunzi, but I don't know if it is true. The plays commonly performed on the stage today, such as "Catching and Releasing Cao," "Slaying Hua Xiong," "White Horse Slope," "Fengyi Pavilion," "Passing Five Passes," "Gucheng Meeting," "Changban Slope," "Gathering of Heroes," "Sweet Dew Temple," "Manghua Pool," "Chaisang Mouth," "Walking Mai City," "Building White Robes," "Lianying Case," and "Empty City Plan," are all legacy plays of the Sanqing troupe. When I was in Beiping in the early Republic of China, the Fuliancheng Opera School performed the "Three Kingdoms Palace" series of plays in Guanghe Lou, but they could not start from the beginning and set a price because the script had already been lost and no one had rewritten it. Today, if there is a stage that can perform the full version of the series "Romance of the Three Kingdoms", it will definitely cause a sensation and control the profitable tickets.</p>
<h3>Seaside Book Venue Tour</h3>
<p>— Jian Fan</p>
<p>(3) Central Book Venue</p>
<p>The hall downstairs in the Central Hotel on Fifth Avenue, seventeen or eighteen years ago, was one of the first hotels in Shanghai to emulate the Oriental Hotel and convert its empty hall into a book venue. However, due to poor business, it closed down not long after. After the war, it was converted into a dance hall. For a period, it was used as a female storytelling venue during the daytime. At that time, the lineup included Xie Letian and his disciple Xiaotian, telling "Yu Qing Ting", Zhao Meifang and her niece Tu Fang, telling "The Three Smiles", and Wan Xuejun's "Yang Naiwu," which were all very popular for a time, but stopped again in less than a year. Recently, the Central Dance Hall has suddenly transformed into a storytelling venue with string and plucked instruments during the day. The music stage serves as the storytelling stage, and the audience seats are set up in the dance floor, which is quiet and free of noise. The storytelling sound is also very concentrated, making it an ideal new type of book venue. Unfortunately, apart from watermelon seeds, there are no other snacks for sale in the venue. Sitting and drinking clear tea while listening to the storytelling is a bit monotonous. Perhaps due to the location and the fact that it is not an old book venue, coupled with the hot weather, the audience is not large. The current lineup consists of five acts, such as Xue Huiping and Zhong Yueqiao's "Yu Qing Ting". Although they are young ballad singers, their singing and storytelling are very skilled. Gu Hongbo's "The Civet Cat for Crown Prince" has reached the point of interrogating Guo Huai, which is a very interesting turning point in the story. Xu Yunzhi's "The Three Smiles" is still a new addition, and he tells it very delicately and engagingly. Yan Xueting's "Yang Naiwu" is performed by a disciple of his, and the final performance of "The Three Smiles: Hangzhou Story" is a joint performance by the Yu Xiaoyun and Xiaoxia brothers, telling "The Legend of the White Snake" to see the guests off. The art of storytelling is all above standard and worth listening to.</p>

<h3>Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(10) Flying Peak</p>
<p>Huanglong, Weicheng, and Cuizhen were inside a room in the back. They hadn't said a few words when a servant girl named Magpie came in. "Someone named Qin wants to see the young master. He's making a scene outside the gate with Ah Xing. Ah Xing told him the young master wasn't home, but he didn't believe it. He asked the second madam where she was. He said he had to talk to the young master." Weicheng raised his head and thought for a moment, then said, "The surname Qin, is it Qin Runzhi?" Magpie said, "That's right, Qin Runzhi. He's been here before. He said he used to be a matchmaker for you, young master." Huanglong said, "He's alone, what are we afraid of? Even if there were ten of them, we wouldn't be afraid." Weicheng said, "It's not a question of whether we're afraid or not. I know he's a member of Wei Yunqing's faction. His arrival here might bring some news from the Wei family." As he said this, Ah Xing walked in and said, "Young master, the second madam is asking you to meet someone with the surname Bang. I told him you weren't home, but the second madam went and told him you were. It's like there are two different stories coming from within our home." Weicheng said, "It's Qin Runzhi, just a pawn. I'll go, I'll go. Brother Long and Sister Cuizhen, don't panic."</p>
<p>He followed Ah Xing outside, knowing that Qin Runzhi was sitting in the Shuangmei Study, so he straightened his clothes and walked in. He saw Qin Runzhi and the Second Madam Ye sitting face to face. Qin Runzhi's eyes were very sharp. As soon as he saw Weicheng, he stood up as if jumping, and then clapped his hands, saying, "I'm reporting a message to Young Master Ye. Wei Yun Gong, Lang Shaoyun, is dead. Do you think I should clap my hands or not?" Weicheng's expression was calm and composed. He dared not agree with him, nor did he refute him. He only replied, "I don't know what illness it was." Qin Runzhi said, "He died of book illness. If he had died of being murdered, that would have been better. Now the old man Wei is clamoring to find the person who murdered his son. We all advised him that it's better to leave things alone. Reporting to the authorities is a long way away, and we have to wait for the authorities to come to the village to examine the body. This expense will probably be enough to bury Shaoyun. There were at least twenty of us who advised him, and we finally convinced the old man, who was hungry, to agree. But he wouldn't take out the money, saying, 'Since I didn't give birth to this son, you have to bury him. You can only ask the locals to donate.' He had some reasons, saying that this was a murder case, and in principle, all neighbors and friends cannot escape responsibility, so they should contribute some money." (208)</p>
