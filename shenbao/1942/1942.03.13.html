<h3 id="c32">「印度精神」輪迴的神秘性 <a href="#c32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>英國自從一七九八年經營印度以來，也有百數十年了；可迄今為止，沿海岸線一帶，還只有大小六表港口，可以停泊。這六表港口之中只有孟買一表良港，加爾各答次之。其　如卡喇齊，馬德拉斯等等也只是湊湊數目罷了。</p>
<p>這等看來，印度豈非一座金城湯池，不可得而侵略了？那也不然。阿三本來也有些太不爭氣。我們要是翻開印度帳簿看看，上自開天闢地，下至今日現代，阿三之遭侵略，大小也有這麽十幾回。</p>
<p>最初的一回，有的史家說是在西元前二千五百年的當口我國還是三皇五帝得道時代，印度就被一羣不折不扣的黑炭，爪哇地人，就是印度現在所齒的「卑賤種」所佔領。這黑炭們，有的說是埃及人，有的說是非洲地的「阿四」，時代太遠，又沒紀戰，無從稽考。</p>
<p>其次的回，就要輪到西　他們都是一羣遊牧族，本來元前一千五百年的亞利安人。　沒有國籍，而秉性強悍好戰。這羣遊牧民族由阿富汗，波斯等國進到印度，碰見了阿彌陀佛的阿三，當然就不客氣，先一示威，再一燒殺，就把業主阿三給屈服了。可是這亞利安人刁蛋不過，旣經佔領印度之後，知道土人不好對付，於是就來了一個約法三章。道第一章乃是宣布不同爪哇地的一「阿四一通婚。第二，同高等土人聯合起來，把全國國民分作四個階級：　祭司文人，　丘八老總，　行商坐賈，　娘姨大姐輩車夫阿二等。並且，一律都要信奉印度教，但各級也不得彼此通婚。</p>
<p>這個級階制度，十分利害。因經這一間隔，就叫全國阿三，一天到晚不得太平；因爲旣經分級之後，那爪哇地人，是打入了畜道，不必說他，而四級人等，也都有註定了命運，翻身不得；　如車夫阿二的小阿二，還在娘胎，就爲他備下了全新車胎的包車一部，直到這阿二長大成人，只好實任就職。這世界的人，都是天老爺賜下一律平等的人權，怎地儘阿二子子孫孫拉車？這當然不平等之至。既不平等，哪能太後平來，過了毛毛二千年之久在尼不爾降生了一位釋迦牟尼，本也是亞利安種的王子；他覺得這階級制度，太不合理，於是提倡輪迴之說。眾生信道，就得超脫輪迥；換句話說，只要是皈依我佛如來，就能一律待遇。爲這件事，後來亞素加王，這一代英明之主，費了九牛二虎之力，想大興佛敎，以踢翻印度敎，及其種種秩次，可是仍舊敵不過印度敎的根深蒂固，爪哇地人始終卑賤到底，不得超脫。到了約莫五百年之後，這佛敎在印度逐漸烟消火滅。由此可見亞利安人的利害。</p>
<p>那第三次的侵略發生在西元前三百二十六年，侵略者就是强橫一世的大亞力山大，本人不到三四年就伸腿去了，留下子孫在印度也玩了這麼整整八個甲子。其後過了四百來年，大約是西元七百五十年的時候，回敎也看中了這印度一片土地，於是以宣敎爲由，大大來一個移民式的侵略。從此有三百個年頭，擾攘爭鬥，才在印度安下回回的根基，直到今日。</p>
<p>可是回回生席才暖，那阿富汗國在二十八年裏面，前後共來征討了十五次，於西元一千○二十七年也做起印度王來；前後也曾盤據了五個世紀。可是二百年後，在一千二百十九年的當口，元主成吉思汗也帶領大兵，走印度的東北角上，一擁而入，與阿富汗王，在印度一片高原之上，大打擂台。看熱鬧的，倒是一般阿三。雖然不免遭些池魚之殃，好在印度有的是人，死他幾個，値得什麽？迢塲熱鬧，弄到一千五百二十六年，阿富汗漸漸招架不住，就此完塲。到一八〇六年，蒙古的勢力已成强弩之末，那嫡系的亞利安人乘此次偏西一帶山脈爲基礎，也想一顯身手。無奈時運不濟，這時英人的潛力已在二百年內養成了氣候（一六〇〇一八〇〇），於是大做起來。這一來，不　把阿三復國的與頭，澆上了一瓢凉水，想想無法，也只好自嘆命苦而已。</p>
<p>可是英國在印度稱雄，也非一蹴而躋，其中倒是費了不少心機，窺伺了不少年月，經過幾番波折，才能如願以償哩。本來初到印度的歐人，還要數到葡萄牙，遠在一四九八年之前。一百年後叉陸續來了荷蘭，丹麥，法國，及英人。看起來還是英人的後來居上；可是其中也有一個最大的緣因。緣因安在？原來在一六六二年英王卻爾斯第二同葡萄牙的公主天作之合，配了婚姻。這位公主倒也大方，就把印度的孟買港當了嫁　贈給却爾斯。却爾斯尤其慷慨，在一六六八年就把這點嫁　送給倫敦東印度公司，每年只取十磅的津貼。的印度事業，就立下了一個不可動搖的基石。常然生意上也就此興隆起來。那時英人的眼中之釘，就是一個法蘭西；於是在一七四四年找了一個事山，就同法人在印度大打出手。七年之久，終於將法人打下馬來。法人祇好在英人手下討生活，勉强支持到百年之久。直到一七六一年英人的柬印度公司正式成立起來，同年阿富汗又來一次征伐，雖然也給了英人不少麻煩，可是終被驅逐出境。好容易弄到一八五七年，印度天下，英人三分有其二，維多利亞才正式收併印土，兼任女王。其時正是在印人最後一次拚命掙扎之後。（未完）</p>

<p>近幾年來、我們中國發生了一個極　軍的問題、那便是食糧的恐慌、遠東烽火漫天、到處兵荒馬亂、海外洋米的接濟、就從此斷絕、我們覺得增加糧食的生產、格外緊要、於是農業上的肥料、便成爲必須研究的問題了、舉個例說、德國每畝田可產小麥十石至十二石、而我國每畝只產二石左右、相差遠甚、大概因種植方法與蟲害的關係、而缺乏合理的肥料、實爲主因、植物需要肥料與人的需要滋養、其理相同、</p>
<p>肥料分類</p>
<p>植物需要的肥料、大致有十餘種而最主要的要素爲氮（N）、磷（P）、鉀（K）二種、肥料的分類　自給肥料與販賣肥料、自給肥料亦稱天然肥料、農家可自行生產、或收集如人糞·廐肥·堆肥·綠肥·草木灰等、販賣肥料亦稱人造肥料、如硫酸鉀·　化鉀·硫酸錏·過燐酸·石灰·豆餅等、　直接肥料與間接肥料、就效用之不同而分、如豆餅·硫酸鉀，硫酸·能直接供給植物的營養、稱爲直接肥料、石灰·石膏·不含植物營養上所必需的成分但間接能使植物生育良好、產量增加者、稱爲問接肥料、　完全肥料及偏質肥料、就含有的成分完全與否而分析、　動物質肥料、植物質肥料、礦物質肥料、及雜質肥料、這是就材料的來源而分析的、動物質肥料爲動物之屍骸及廢棄物、如人糞尿·廐肥·骨粉等、植物質肥料爲植物體及植物質製造之殘渣、如豆餅·油　·草大灰·綠肥等、礦物質肥料爲各種礦產或化學製造品、如硫酸　·硫酸鉀·過燐酸石灰·石灰·石膏·雜質肥料又名混合肥料、由動植礦之二種或三種以上混合而成、如堆肥河泥等、</p>
<p>人糞分析</p>
<p>我國農村經濟薄弱、兼之國家工　業落後、所以化學肥料非常缺乏、惟有着重天然肥料、而以人糞爲主體、依農業家的統計、中國人每人每年平均排洩的尿糞爲八百二十斤、歐美人因食料之不問約在七百五十斤左右、上海三百萬人口照此推算、每年可產糞二十四萬萬斤、糞大王向承銷給各　農民、每担値一元半至一元八角、總數甚爲可觀、全國五萬萬人口、如果整個的統計起來、到是一筆極大的富源呢、至於人糞的性質、以老年人病人的排洩物爲最佳、因其消化力差、殘餘的蛋白質多、於植物的營養爲最有價值、孩童壯男消化力强、排洩物的營簽力弱、勞動階級雖然吃得多、消化亦强、孕婦產婦亦然、人糞中包含的氣·磷·鉀·成分很多、鄕村裏的糞坑、應三面砌以圍牆、不給陽光所蒸發、使發酵作用遲緩、簽分不致揮發、最好放些石膏、使它慢慢兒發酵、北方雨水較少、可製成糞磚、南方雨水多、大可不必、夏季天熱、傳染病流行、居家往往滲入消毒藥如來沙而·臭藥水、以撲滅細菌、法固善、而妨碍植物的成長、則大大的不利、我想最近之將來、定可發明如何可消毒、而不失肥料的價值、如何可滲入香料、而减少臭氣、旣消毒又减臭、則居家與農民一舉而兩便了、</p>
<p>牲畜肥料</p>
<p>牲畜的肥料、有的成分複雜、而分解甚慢、稱爲冷性、馬糞有熟性發醇力大、園　上用途最廣、歐洲各國農民、視牲畜的糞爲第一種的自給肥料、他們有句通行的農諺「無家畜即無肥料、無肥料即無農業」、其次骨粉爲佳、牲畜的骨、經高溫度蒸熱後、骨內脂肪質溶解、再用重壓機粉碎共骨、其中燐質極多、果樹最需此種肥料、還有綠肥、植物如黃豆·大豆·芥菜·　麥等、長成後、翻入土中、久之成爲良好的肥料、可以大量普遍應用、他如草木灰包含多量的炭酸鉀、促進種子的迅速發芽、亦爲有價値的肥料、總之、天然肥料農民應盡量利用、再加天時地利的調整、農產必可增加、經濟必可富裕、利國福民、當能達到目的、</p>

<p>偏是天公不做美，好像與一班為生存而擠軋的故意開玩笑，不是朔風刮得你皮　破裂，重襖不溫；還要來冰雹雪花，點綴那初春景象；又鬧個雨絲風片，述日不休；水從　梢直淋到脚跟，背介骨倒成了上天下地的水落；兩隻脚自脚心冷起直冷到膝蓋骨以上，休想動彈，好在前擠後擁，用不着你起勁費力，不是一向前移，就是向後退，潮米　去，左　右擺，只要你　　　　　　　的人，後　的人　　　　　的　頭，再須擋提　　　極人，旁敲側擊，前後夾攻，那末，號頭一寫，纔算註定你今天購買的命運。你纔得鬆弛了前後的緊軋，稍得透一口氣，吐一口沫，喊一聲啊唷，望着前面的人，一個一個遞上去，輪着了你，你總算不虛了此行，達到你這天爲生存而掙扎的目的。最可憐是足足等待了幾個鐘頭，寫不着號頭，有了號頭，仍舊買不着怎麽東西。更不幸經不起軋，擋不住攔，只要半個身子斜　在外頭，就不由分說，拉了你出去。憑你千訴萬說，虛費了許多辰光：忍　挨凍，挽回不轉你失望的愁腸。倒是强橫霸道硬行插入的，以及有米頭，也可以憑空挨進去，笑咪咪買了就走，眞要氣得你七　出烟，心頭火起，但是你終沒奈何他：爲什麽你沒有氣力，又沒有來頭，只要埋怨你自己命運低。</p>
<p>阿根啦娘，軋了雨天，軋得來前胸後痛，睡在床上，茶飯也不想吃了！</p>
<p>財賓前天去軋，偏不幸頭上墳起一大塊，倒做了孔老夫子，頭如覆孟。</p>
<p>啊喲，你真蠢、你不做那一百零八將中的穆弘，你就得做那紅　禧中金玉奴的對手力，不然，你休想去軋。</p>
<p>不要緊，我好似天生成的楊七郎，憑他怎樣，我只當他是撣灰　，　護　。</p>
<p>聽說張家的煤球風爐，已是多日不舉火。</p>
<p>李家的嫂嫂，說是三日不知油味。</p>
<p>苞米粉煮粥吃，好比早時吃的常錫機白粳，還要甘香有味。</p>
<p>那知道高梁粉夾靑菜，堪比得紅嘴綠鸚哥，一般美麗。</p>
<p>一件件，椿樁，說他怎甚：終歸是，命運註定。</p>
<p>我們的孔老夫子，說的是「不患寡而患不均，」就是要多寡得其宜，分配得其允。</p>
<p>我們的孟老夫子，也說是「恭者不侮人，儉者不　人；」可知道是節省物力之中，不奪人之所好。</p>
<p>雖然，這或許要你勞其筋骨，餓其體　，刻苦自勵，不要意志頹喪，仍得　發有爲。若照一般醉生夢死的人們，出人於歌塲舞榭，狂做那投機生意，　戒之不爲過。何况尙沒有使他感覺苦痛。倒是一般安分營生的，天天打愁結，日子眞難度。</p>
<p>「紇干山頭凍死雀，何不飛去生處樂。」何嘗不可如是，無如　　未　，何處可寄托？偏叫他離去所業，更有何是樂，這叫做沒奈何，仟　千磨百折，只怪命運歹。</p>

<p>— 空眞</p>
<p>集郵現在在上海差不多成爲一種極普通而平凡的消遣品了，可是在從前却不然，大家都以爲集郵是一種豪舉，耗數百金而購得者，在所不惜。所以西諺有這樣一句話，即「郵爲消遣之王，王之消遣」，這句話的意思，以爲一定要是名公鉅卿，才配得上「集郵家」，普通人即不能集郵了。可是時在今日則不然，上至一國之元首，下至任何那種職業的人，都可以集郵。最　著的集郵人物，若美國現任大總統羅斯福，美前任總統胡佛，英故皇喬治五世等皆是，好來塢的男女明星，嗜好是道的也不在少數。美內務部長阿愛克司（Harold　Ickes)　官：「集郵爲人生一天決事，對工作煩勞者　甚，蓋公餘之暇，偶翻郵本，即可使精神煥發。對於敎育，更有吳大利益，能使天眞爛漫之兒童，對於史地增加無限興趣」。由此可見集郵之趣味了。世界各國的郵票，係英國首先創始，（時在公元一八四〇年，即淸道光二十年左右）。我國採用此法極遲，直至光緒四年，方有正式郵票通用，所以我國郵史極短。（歐戰後所新與之小國例外）集郵的風尙，直至民國五六年，才有較多的人蒐集，所以郵票的商店，也該自彼時開設。</p>
<p>我國的正式郵票，在前淸所發的，有龍圖，鵝圖，以及數種紀念票，如宜統登極，慈禧太后萬壽圖等。在軍閥時代，張作霖也曾發行過海陸軍大元帥的郵票，但此種郵票，只限於他所管轄制的幾省通用，故市面很少，售價也很高。到民國二十幾年時所發的紀念票很多，如孫總理國葬，光復紀念，譚院長紀念，憲法紀念票，共和紀念，新生活等等。普通郵票差不多都是總理像，烈士像等，但在民國二十年時，會發生過總理票的趣事，即普通所謂之單圈雙圈之別。因爲該時這種郵票委托德拉魯（Messrs：　La．　De．　Rue．　＆Co，）公司　模印刷，那知西人不懂我國，國民黨黨徽的意思，竟把白日的一輪，復多　一圈，凡一分二分四分二角一元二元五元七種，即通稱雙圈票的總理像，後雖經政府電令修正，但外面通用的已經很多了。在一九三九年時，也曾發過「慶祝美國百五十年紀念票」，去年六月底，會發過「節約建國票」。</p>
<p>上海爲全國第一大商埠，所以也就是全國集郵市塲的總滙，故稍有變動，即可影響全國。上海的郵票商店，星羅棋布，關於郵票的書籍，也是日新月異，但是價錢昂貴，所以在這年頭集郵，也是樁難事啊！</p>

<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>至於現在那婦孺皆知最爲流行的「香蕉」的名字是從那裏來的呢？原來却只見之於番禺縣志。它在物產門中說：「蕉，……有靑牙，黃牙，」香蕉」三種，香美。」可見香蕉也只是許許多多種類中一個特異的名稱，現在竟成了這種果實的總代表了。一名之微亦須隨風轉移：假設現在有人到水　店中要買「甘蕉」或「蕉子」，恐怕他們要瞠目不知所對吧！番　縣志上又記載旁的種類說：「有名「狗攀子」，小株，矮狗可攀也，味淡品賤。有一種，子甚大，蒸熟與孩子食以代乳，名「喂仔蕉」諸蕉皆性寒，不宜多食，惟「喂仔蕉」熟食不傷人。……」從吳其溶植物名實圖考引證嶺南雜記的記載，我們知道香蕉又有其名俗而不堪的「棒槌蕉」和「狗牙蕉」，更有艷麗媚人「作玫瑰花香」的「玫瑰蕉·」更從它引證的南越筆記上看，我們還可以知道「……以「香牙蕉」爲美，一名「龍奶」，——奶，乳也，美若龍之乳，不可多得！……」還有許許多多旁的名稱，一時也叫人弄不淸頭緒，等着有嗜痂者去繼茶譜荔枝譜……之後而作「香蕉譜」吧。</p>
<p>按外國植物學家的分類法，香蕉可以分爲三種：第一種，就是前邊說過的　Musa　paradisiaca　果實粗大，不能生吃，只好燒熟當菜餚用；這大概相當於上面引證的板蕉，喂仔蕉，或棒槌蕉等。第二種名叫　Musa　pasientnm，果實較小，滋味雋美；第三種名叫　Musa　sinensis,—中國種香蕉—株幹低矮，果實芳甘：這兩種全可以生吃，應該相當於前面說過的羊角蕉，佛指，或龍奶蕉等。可是第二種和第三種的分別在那裏呢？第二種果實稍大，外殼較厚，能够歷時行遠，運輪時手續簡便，不須要特種設備。至於中國種香蕉則容易腐爛。裝船裝車時必須加意保護，譬如用棉花包裏或放入冷藏室等。所以販賣水　的大腹賈們，尤其是英國人，更喜歡運載那第二種香蕉哩。</p>
<p>香蕉的「生吞活剝」所謂生吃法的，是我們每人—說的是在上海的人！所司空「嘗」慣最爲熟知的，用不着去叙述，香蕉的熟食法，前邊已說過喂仔蕉的蒸熟以後叫小孩子吃；現在：我國北方酒館中流行的吃法有兩種·一是用搪和牛奶作汁燒淸吃，一是叫香蕉拖了麫然後用豆油炸着吃。我想廣束那著名的廚師們一定還有很多的新花樣吧，可惜這事是無從去問津哩！再根據生物世界的記載，美洲西印度羣島上的廚司，對於香蕉的烹製法却眞是各色各式，千奇百巧，名目繁多，富麗堂皇，絕不是舊大陸上的人所敢望其項背的上况且把香蕉晒乾製粉的工業正在抬頭，將來在市塲上，我們或者可以見到除了耦粉菱粉……以外，又有「香蕉粉」來供我們驅策了吧。至於用香蕉製飲料，製罐頭……更是盡人皆知的了。聽說在南美北部圭亞那地方人，又把香蕉造成一種爲黑人所非常噹愛的香蕉酒！</p>
<p>香蕉每生只懷胎一次，結果一軸，而它這種果實呢，却又不能叫種子發育成熟，那它怎樣去避免減種絕類的大禍呢？就是母株一軸花穗，它根下的新　芽已蓬勃四出；等着母株開花結實成爲得　之蹄得魚之　可以閉目息眉了，—平常是人把它立刻斫去。—那它的子女們已竟可以巍然成立了。若一公畝香蕉田按一千株香蕉計算，每年收穫兩次，—母株子株各一—約得二十五公斤重的果實兩千軸。勤加灌漑，多上肥料，並且可以把這個數目倍起來。現在上海的香蕉要賣到一兩角一　，這種利息應該是多麽優厚吧！</p>

<p>孔子以謀道不謀食敎人，然而孔夫人或竟感於巧婦難爲無米之炊，故孔子亦不能不慨然於衣食足而後知禮義，飲食男女人之大欲存焉，人莫不知味也。雖然他也會說君子食無求飽，居無求安，可是至少食求半飽，縱不能益壽，也還是延年之道，所以古人談到飯食，其結論只是「民以食為天」。趙威后問齊使，歲亦無恙耶，民亦無恙耶，王亦無恙耶，苟無歲，何有民，苟無民，何有君，亦足見古人對民食之何等重視，韓愈雜說「故雖有名馬，食不飽，力不足，……安求其能千里也。」</p>
<p>今之視昔，後之視今生之者眾，食之者寡，生之者寡，食之者眾，豈可忽略，豈可淡忘此千古不刊之名論？</p>

<p>那理髮店門口的紅白靑三色捲筒，現在是旋轉得更有勁兒了。原來，當着這煤米油鹽價格飛漲的時節，理髮費也快馬加鞭地迎「頭」趕上去。</p>
<p>不要去提起那些四十元五十元的什麼「冷氣克蘭姆雷燙」之類，就是普通的頭髮，低首一下，就非法幣二紙不行。雖說這樣是表示出「頭　有價」，不過想想總有些「不合算」似的。—像坐牢監般的坐上個把鐘頭，一　腦壳還得聽人簸弄，眼看那「受之父母」的髮絲，被無情的剪刀胡亂地糟蹋掉；如此吃虧，未了尙須付錢，眞是從何說起？</p>
<p>省些錢，多留幾天再去修剪吧，雖然不會到「白髮三千丈」那們的程度，但是那一付一怒髮上　冠」的樣兒，也有些叫人看不入眼，實是有得觀瞻；並且，據說還不大衛生哩！——不過，有些自稱藝術家之流，是例外，他們那一頭蜂　似的美髮，是被極口贊賞的，唯一的理由是因爲他們是藝術家，而藝術家的風度，必定是「不凡」的。……這種風度，如今是引起了一些人的羨慕了。</p>
<p>坐在理髮店裏的椅子上，看看鏡內自己的頭被人侮弄，拉雜地想到了這些。突然，又想起了那首滑稽的詩句：「試看剃頭者，人亦剃其頭」，不覺感到牠意味相當深遠，而開始入於遐思了。</p>

<p>對一個住在北京的人說「逛市塲」，同對一個住在蘇州的人說「到覜前去」，一樣地令人感覺得「優閑」得很。市塲是指東安市塲，觀前却是街道名稱。由逛市塲的「逛」字，我們可以知道不一定去買東西。而到觀前去的朋友，又多半是口含松子糖或是牙嗑西瓜子。他們的目的，祗是去「逛逛」，或「是走走」，消遣這無法打發的時間。誓如一個養房產的北京人（俗稱吃瓦片的），一早起來，到中央公園或是北海公園蹓　蹓躂，躱在松柏深處，練上一段太極拳。然後在茶社裏一坐，來上一　「香片」或是「龍井」，和幾個天天見面的朋友，談談說說。中午到了，輸流在小館子裏做個「東」：四兩白乾酒，幾碟饅頭，幾只拚盤炒菜，買一個酒酣飯飽。醉醺醺地跑到琉璃廠，古董鋪裏坐坐，書畫店裏談談。春天來了，崇效寺去看牡丹。秋天來了，西山去賞楓葉。一天天他把自己由遺少變爲遺老。一個靠田產的蘇州人呢。離牀後第一件公幹，是上茶館。吃一頓蹄膀麵蝦蟹麵之類的點心。添枝加葉地談一些口傳新聞。午飯之後，或是觀前去聽會把「書」，或是在茶館裏湊四個人义义麻將。生活好像一齣滑稽的喜劇，嘻嘻哈哈裏開幕了。嘻嘻哈哈裏閉幕了。有人把這兩種生活方式，來代表東方的「精神文明」。前一種生活像一首泊淡寗靜的「詩」。後一種生活像一齣熱鬧可笑的「戲」。有人到了北京，捨不得離開，說那裏有「蔚藍的天」。叉有人到了蘇州，不肯離開，說那裏有「可愛的秋香」。「秋香是（三笑故事裏的主角）在上海旣沒有蔚藍的天」，也沒有「可愛的秋香」。但是你倘若有興緻，你可以發現另一種東方「精神文明」的生活方式。馬路上走着一對對年輕男女，年紀輕得你可以估定他（她）們大學沒有畢業。女的手臂緊緊地吊住了男的，吊得男的肩膀有些一高一低。一脚高一脚低地跳出電影院，鑽進咖啡館；跑出咖啡館，又縮進了跳舞塲。忙得像一只「走馬燈」。據說書沒有什麽可讀的，何况家裏不須要他（她）們去「軋米」？這似乎在兩兩種「精神文明」的生活方式之外的又一種了。</p>

<p>Tokyo, 12th (Haitong News Agency) – Japanese Navy spokesman Hirai declared in the January issue of "Japanese Frontline News" that Ceylon is no longer a safe haven for British fleets, and the British fleets have been forced to retreat to Mumbai. According to recent intelligence, in order to protect British power east of Suez, the British government continues to send two battleships and two aircraft carriers to India, attempting a final struggle. Now, the remnants of the British, American, and Dutch navies in Darwin Harbor are not worth paying attention to. The US Pacific Fleet has suffered heavy losses, and it will take at least three or four years to restore it to its pre-war state. Although President Roosevelt has a massive air and naval plan, its realization is slim under the Japanese blockade. Today, Japan has become the master of the Pacific, and one day the Indian Ocean and the Pacific will both become the Japanese Sea.</p>
<p>London, 12th (Reuters) – Authorities here declared yesterday that after repeated setbacks in the Far East, the Indian Ocean is now wide open. It is expected that Japan will attack Allied trade and transportation in the Indian Ocean. Japanese activities may extend as far as Ceylon in India, or focus on an offensive against Darwin Harbor in Australia.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 11th (Reuters) – The Army Headquarters issued a communiqué stating that there has been no new news from the central front since yesterday. The communiqué also mentioned yesterday evening's communiqué, which stated that the civil authorities in the Irrawaddy Delta had evacuated due to the presence of Japanese troops in the area. This was done before the Japanese landed. According to a statement issued by the civil defense authorities, a certain city in Myanmar reported Japanese aerial activity, but there were no air raids in other areas, and no important news was reported. A communiqué from the British Royal Air Force Command in Myanmar stated that British bombers attacked Moulmein the night before.</p>
<p>Tōjō Warns Australia and India</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Dōmei News Agency) – Prime Minister Tōjō delivered a speech in parliament this morning, warning Australia and India to change their attitudes to avoid being misled by Britain and the United States. He said, in essence, "Australia must understand that it has no ability to defend itself against the ever-victorious Japanese army. If it does not change its current attitude, it will inevitably follow the example of the Dutch East Indies. It is hoped that it can decide its attitude at this extremely important juncture. India has been occupied by Britain for a long time, and Britain is now thinking of using various tricks to deceive India. If Indian leaders disregard the long-standing wishes of the Indian people, abandon the God-given opportunity, and still willingly be fooled by Britain, then it is believed that India will never have a chance to save itself. The misfortune of India's 400 million people will be the greatest." Prime Minister Tōjō also said that Japan is determined to intensify its operations until it defeats Britain and the United States and establishes a new order in East Asia. In addition, Prime Minister Tōjō also described the progress of the war in great detail.</p>
<p>Admiral Hart Discusses Allied Navy</p>
<p>Washington, 11th (United Press) – Admiral Hart, commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, who recently returned home, said that the Japanese army's achievements in the Far East were due to the superiority of its air force. The Allied naval strength in the Far East is very weak, but it fights extremely well. Since the sinking of the British battleship Repulse and the Prince of Wales, half of the Allied fleet in the Far East is made up of American warships. The Repulse and the Prince of Wales were the only two battleships the Allies had in the Pacific, so their loss was extremely serious. The Allies' plan will be overturned by the loss of this base, as Japan can use its superior air force to destroy the facilities of most of the Allied naval bases. In the first two months, the Allies used ten convoys to transport troops and supplies to Singapore. Some Dutch warships and a few American warships were also used for escort purposes. When asked whether the Allies would launch a formal offensive to recover lost territory or carry out a flank attack, Hart replied that a frontal attack is always difficult, while a flank attack is always easier to implement.</p>

<p>Saigon, 12th (Haitong News Agency) – According to news received here, Dutch East Indies Deputy Governor Van Mook declared in Melbourne yesterday that Australia must prepare for the worst. Australian troops must be concentrated under unified command and must pay attention to attacking the Japanese army's supply lines. However, the number of Allied reinforcements that arrived in Java was very small, and the air force consisted of only a few British and American fighters and Flying Fortresses. The Dutch East Indies navy and air force suffered heavy losses in Malaya, Borneo, and elsewhere, so they could not prevent the Japanese from landing. The lack of adequate training of the troops resulted in great losses of soldiers and materiel. Britain and the United States probably underestimated the seriousness of the situation, which led to ineffective assistance to the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<p>Melbourne, 11th (Havas News Agency) – Dutch East Indies Deputy Governor Van Mook, accompanied by his colleagues, fled here from Java. He will soon travel to Washington via London to take up a position in the Dutch central government in London. According to Van Mook's account to reporters about the Java campaign, the number of Japanese troops who landed was greater than expected, and the landing points covered the entire coast. As for the defense forces, a small part of the reinforcements hoped for from the Allied countries did arrive. These troops were originally prepared to go to Singapore, but were temporarily reassigned to the Dutch East Indies. However, most of them were not fully equipped. We transferred most of these troops to the front lines to assist in the fighting. The US Asiatic Fleet, based in Manila, also came to help. A few British warships also came to help. In terms of air force, there was initially a weak air force, including British and American fighter squadrons and some Flying Fortresses. Afterwards, except for a few fighters, no other aircraft arrived. All the troops that arrived in time fought bravely. However, when reinforcements did not follow, we knew that there would be no more help from now on. When the Japanese army landed in Java, the Dutch fleet and air force had actually lost their fighting power, because our navy and air force were unusable after participating in the battles of Malaya, Borneo, and the Makassar Strait. Furthermore, the Dutch East Indies' national defense plan was not completed at all before the outbreak of this war, especially the air force. The government had ordered more materials than usual, and although there were enough air force personnel, not all of them were fully trained. I have witnessed the inevitable consequences of a lack of training: In short, both soldiers and materials suffered losses. I would like to offer two pieces of advice to the Australian authorities: First, concentrate all wartime organizations to avoid the lack of coordination caused by the separation of command posts. Second, do not fight with inadequately trained troops, because proper training is of great significance. Aerial bombardment does not have a serious impact on the morale of well-trained troops. Japanese aircraft are better than "Wirraways" and "Brewsters," but not as good as "Hurricanes" and the best American fighters. However, Japanese pilots are quite excellent. In short, Australia must prepare for the worst situation. Although the Soviet Union can provide assistance due to its geographical location, it is busy with events in Europe and has no time to take care of other matters.</p>
<p>Canberra, 11th (Reuters) – Dutch East Indies Deputy Governor Van Mook has flown from Melbourne to Canberra. Mook met with Dutch officials in Melbourne on the 7th to discuss the re-establishment of Dutch military power. According to Tan Wanlong, although he surrendered to the Japanese army to protect the safety of civilians, the government has ordered the troops on the front lines to continue fighting. I believe that the three armies will be able to operate. Central Sumatra is still in the hands of the Dutch army. Most of the Dutch naval personnel have escaped from Java, and a large number of air force personnel and trainees have also escaped.</p>

<p>Washington, 12th (Havas News Agency) – French Ambassador to the United States Heydrich visited Under Secretary of State Welles today to protest against the anti-French propaganda conducted by American newspapers and radio stations, saying that the US government's condoning of this propaganda will inevitably make relations between France and the United States more complicated. When the ambassador left the State Department, a reporter asked, "The Soviet side is rumored to have said that when Germany and France signed an armistice, France was building 40 warships and has now handed them over to Germany. Is this true?" The ambassador replied that the French fleet is entirely in the hands of the French and will be so in the future. When asked about the rumor that the French-owned African island of Madagascar would become a Japanese base, the ambassador also said that he had not heard that the Japanese government had made such a request, and that France would protect its colonies, especially Madagascar.</p>
<p>Washington, 12th (Reuters) – French Ambassador Heydrich reassured US Under Secretary of State Welles yesterday that the French fleet would not be handed over to the Axis powers. Afterwards, Heydrich told reporters that Madagascar belongs to France now and will be so in the future. It will never be handed over to any party. Subsequently, British Ambassador Halifax also visited Welles, but the purpose of this visit was not disclosed.</p>
<p>London, 12th (Reuters) – London sources stated last night that at present, there is no sign that the Germans intend to take over the French fleet. There have been rumors about the future of the French fleet for a long time, but Admiral Darlan is quite proud of the French fleet he created, and it is questionable whether he would allow this fleet to fall into German hands. The French ship Dunkirk, which was damaged in Oran and subsequently transferred to Toulon, may not be suitable for action for many months to come. Many French ships have been anchored in Toulon for a long time. However, as far as is known, the Richelieu is now moored in Dakar, and its sister ship, the Jean Bart, has not yet been completed, and has been transferred to Casablanca. Its construction work may not be proceeding, because Casablanca does not have the facilities for the large-scale projects required by the ship.</p>

<p>Lyon, 11th (Havas News Agency) – The Lyon Supreme Court today continued to try former Premier Blum. Justice Gao asked the reasons for nationalizing the ordnance factories. Blum replied that the French people mostly believed that the ordnance production during the last war was very successful, so they mostly advocated nationalization, with only the Communist Party opposing it. For example, the Schneider armory received an order from the Soviet Union, stating that the factory did not want to be nationalized. The Soviet Ambassador Bodankin even personally approached me to negotiate. Justice Gao also asked about the 40-hour work week issue. He replied that the 40-hour work week and leisure organizations had a positive impact on military production. As for me, during my tenure, I always advocated a non-armed peaceful policy. This has been advocated by successive cabinets after the war and has also been supported by the canine part of the country. As for the disarmament policy of the Socialist Party, it has never advocated immediate, complete, or unilateral disarmament. Because my country continues to work for peace, its international status has been greatly improved. The country that prepares for peace but does not wage war has close ties with other countries, and international support for my country is growing. At this point, I do not have a war crime. I believe that over the years I have been regarded as a pacifist and have spared no effort to maintain peace. Even although I am a Jew and a Marxist, I still received Hitler's representative Schacht, whose motivation was to ensure peace.</p>

<h3 id="e23">Churchill Announces in the House of Commons Permission for India to Implement Constitutional Governance, with Cripps Negotiating Secondary Issues to Be Resolved As Well <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>London, 11th (Havas) - Prime Minister Churchill today made an important statement in the House of Commons regarding the Indian question. The Prime Minister stated that no decision would be made regarding the legal status India should hold until a thorough investigation of the situation in that country was conducted. Therefore, Sir Stafford Cripps will be responsible for conducting the investigation to facilitate this. "Since the Japanese army advanced southward, India has faced a crisis. Therefore, the British government sincerely hopes that India will concentrate all its efforts so that it can resolutely resist any future attacks. This expectation has been increasing day by day. As for our country's policy towards India and its objectives, the government issued a statement in August 1940, and offered a promise to grant India dominion status, equal to that of other dominions of the British Empire, as soon as the war ends. In addition, we will allow the drafting of a constitution for the Indian people in the future. The drafting of this constitution must not only take into account the lives of the Indian people but also obtain the full consent of the Indian people, so that any provision of this constitution can be accepted by the Indian people. At the same time, we still have the obligation to protect the various ethnic minorities and lower classes in India, which goes without saying. However, since we are closely related to India, we should find ways to resolve certain secondary issues. In recent weeks, various parties have been arguing endlessly about the Indian question, and no consensus has been reached. In order to avoid this unnecessary debate, we have decided to take various measures to avoid the following situations. In other words: 1. Do not allow a powerful minority group in India to oppose the reform plan for a long period of time without end. 2. Do not allow the measures taken by the majority ethnic group to encounter opposition from the minority ethnic groups. Therefore, we originally intended to take immediate steps to make a constructive contribution to the establishment of an autonomous government in India. However, we are deeply afraid that this step will be too hasty and will do more harm than good. Therefore, the urgent task is to obtain the full support of all parties in India and to obtain guarantees that they will put all their strength at our disposal to protect our common interests. To this end, we have sent a member of the wartime cabinet to India to discuss everything with key Indian figures. I believe that this solution is fair. Sir Stafford Cripps volunteered to go to India. He will try to obtain the support of the majority ethnic groups in India and attempt to seek the support of certain powerful minority ethnic groups (mainly Muslims). At that time, Sir Stafford Cripps will meet with the Governor-General and the Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army and firmly express to all parties that our government is determined to fulfill all its obligations to protect India from the threat of the current crisis. In short, Sir Stafford Cripps will go to India in the near future. The House of Commons does not need to debate this matter before he returns to report, as this would only make the trip unsuccessful. During his absence, the position of the government representative in the House of Commons will be temporarily held by Foreign Secretary Eden."</p>
<p>Political Parties Agree on Measures to Handle India</p>
<p>London, 11th (Reuters) - Prime Minister Churchill read a statement in the House of Commons today stating that the government has decided to send Lord Privy Seal Cripps to India and grant him full power to carry out his mission, namely to present to India the conclusion unanimously reached by the wartime cabinet regarding the constitutional status of India. The Prime Minister's statement lasted seven minutes and was delivered in a very slow manner. The history of India's constitution has thus opened a new page. The House of Commons and the House of Lords had originally scheduled to debate the Indian situation this week, but were temporarily canceled at the request of the Prime Minister. There is little doubt that Cripps will gain the trust and support of all parties during this trip to India. The Prime Minister's statement was agreed to by all members. All parties praised the Prime Minister for dealing with this complex situation with the demeanor of a statesman. How important the issues that will be considered in the future and the solution to this issue (referring to sending an envoy to India) are, has not been deliberately ignored by all parties. This solution can be considered unanimously agreed upon by all major political parties, as the Conservative Party has also welcomed Cripps to India in the same way as other political parties.</p>
<p>London, 10th (Reuters) - London's evening newspapers unanimously published the news of the government's decision to send Lord Privy Seal Cripps as an envoy to India in a prominent position. The Standard Evening News stated that Cripps's mission is to make Indian leaders believe that the British people sincerely hope that India will transition to unity and freedom. This task is extremely difficult. Cripps is often a candidate who is willing to take on the task. He has many close personal relationships with Indian leaders. Britain and the free world all hope that he will achieve something in this difficult task.</p>
<p>Indian Representative to the United States Bajpai Makes a Statement</p>
<p>Washington, 11th (Reuters) - Indian Representative to the United States Bajpai, after talking with the US President at the White House, told reporters that he was satisfied with Cripps's visit to India. It is said that Cripps's policy toward India has always been known for its liberalism. When Cripps visited India two years ago, he had many meetings with Indian leaders. That visit to India was almost a prelude to the success of this trip. Bajpai also said that his visit to Roosevelt today was unrelated to the British announcement of Cripps's visit to India. US Undersecretary of State Welles introduced him to the President, and Welles also participated in discussions on sending a US delegation to India. Bajpai said that he hoped that the delegation would achieve complete success in the war efforts in India's production. The British Ministry of Supply had previously sent the Rogers delegation to India and submitted a report to the British government last summer. The delegation achieved excellent results. India's welcome to the US delegation can show India's eagerness to cooperate with the United States and its desire to learn what assistance the United States can provide to India.</p>
<p>London, 10th - According to reliable Indian sources, they believe that the biggest obstacle in the negotiations is the question of whether to allow the Indian Executive Council to be responsible to the Governor-General, in other words, to the British government. Although there is constant hostility between the National Congress and the Muslim League, the leaders of both parties are believed to be willing to work to promote the Indianization of the Executive Council, but only on the condition that the issue of to whom it is responsible must be resolved.</p>
<p>German External Sources Comment on British-Indian Relations</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Haitong News Agency) - A German Foreign Ministry official declared that whether the Indian people will continue to trust Britain's promises or trust the warnings of Indian leader Bose regarding Lord Privy Seal Cripps's visit to India is currently unknown. The British official stated that Cripps's visit was to inspect the ethnic minorities in India and not for the benefit of Britain. However, Britain often uses internal disputes in India, and it is likely to continue to adopt this strategy.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Havas) - The newspapers here have commented on British Prime Minister Churchill's announcement in the House of Commons that Lord Privy Seal Cripps will visit India, saying that Britain wants to deceive the Indian people again. The People's Observer stated that at this critical moment of survival, Britain has become anxious about everything. There is no doubt that Churchill will make greater concessions to India than before. However, Churchill's declaration this time is actually his usual trick of being conceited and overestimating himself. The German Daily reported that Britain is anxious about its Indian colonies.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Haitong News Agency) - A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry pointed out that the British government has no real desire to solve the Indian problem. In 1929, Churchill said that granting India dominion status was an unimaginable thing. In a speech in 1930, he stated that Britain would never be prepared to give up India. This time, Churchill sent Cripps to India to have Cripps deal with unsolvable difficult problems, not with the sincerity to solve the Indian problem.</p>

<p>Cairo, 12th (Reuters) - There were no major battles in Libya yesterday. According to a communiqué issued today by the British Middle East Command, British patrol teams resumed activity on Wednesday, but no major incidents occurred.

In addition, there is only patrol and air activity in the vanguard area. Armored patrols from both sides are active in enemy territory. Currently, British and German forces are contending for air superiority. Tobruk is a frequent target of German aircraft attacks.</p>

<p>Britain has been managing India since 1798, for over a century. Yet, to this day, along the coastline, there are only six ports of various sizes where ships can dock. Among these six ports, only Mumbai is a good port, followed by Kolkata. Others like Karachi, Madras, etc. are just for show.</p>
<p>Judging from this, is India an impregnable fortress, impossible to invade? That is not the case. Indians have always been a bit too disappointing. If we were to open the Indian ledger and take a look, from the beginning of time to the present day, India has been invaded in this way, both large and small, over a dozen times.</p>
<p>The first time, some historians say, was around 2500 BC. When our country was still in the era of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, India was occupied by a group of unadulterated dark-skinned people, people from Java, who are now the "lowly caste" in India. These dark-skinned people, some say were Egyptians, some say were "Africans," but the era is too far away, and there are no battle records, so there is no way to verify it.</p>
<p>The second time, it was the Aryans from the west. They were a group of nomadic tribes, originally from 1500 BC. They had no nationality, but were inherently fierce and warlike. This group of nomadic people entered India from countries such as Afghanistan and Persia. When they met the Indians, of Amitabha, they were naturally impolite, first putting on a show of force, and then burning and killing, and subdued the owner, the Indian. However, these Aryans were not easy to deal with. After occupying India, they knew that the natives were not easy to deal with, so they came up with a three-chapter law. The first chapter was to announce that they would not intermarry with the Javanese "Africans." Second, they united with the higher-class natives and divided the national people into four classes: priests and literati, soldiers and generals, merchants and traders, and maids and older sisters, rickshaw pullers, etc. Also, everyone had to believe in Hinduism, but each class could not intermarry with each other.</p>
<p>This class system was very harmful. Because after this separation, all the Indians were not at peace all day long. Because after the class division, the Javanese were thrown into the animal path, not to mention them, and the four classes of people were also destined for their fate, unable to turn over. For example, the little Indians of rickshaw pullers and waiters had a brand new rickshaw prepared for them in their mother's womb, and they would have to take office as soon as they grew up. All people in this world are given equal human rights by God, why should rickshaw pullers and waiters pull rickshaws for generations? This is certainly extremely unequal. Since it is not equal, how can there be peace? After about two thousand years, Shakyamuni was born in Nepal, also a prince of Aryan descent. He felt that this class system was too unreasonable, so he advocated the theory of reincarnation. If sentient beings believe in the Way, they will be freed from reincarnation. In other words, as long as they convert to my Buddha Tathagata, they can be treated equally. For this matter, King Ashoka, this generation of enlightened ruler, spent a lot of effort trying to promote Buddhism to overthrow Hinduism and its various orders, but he still could not defeat the deep-rooted nature of Hinduism, and the Javanese remained lowly to the end, unable to be freed. About five hundred years later, Buddhism gradually disappeared in India. From this, we can see the harm of the Aryans.</p>
<p>The third invasion occurred in 326 BC, and the invader was the powerful Alexander the Great. He himself died within three or four years, leaving his descendants to play in India for a full eight Jiazi. After four hundred years, around 750 AD, Islam also took a fancy to this piece of land in India, and under the pretext of evangelism, launched a large-scale immigration-style invasion. From then on, there were three hundred years of turmoil and struggle before the foundation of Islam was laid in India, until today.</p>
<p>But no sooner had the Muslims settled down than Afghanistan came to conquer fifteen times in twenty-eight years, and in 1027 AD, they also became kings of India. They also occupied it for five centuries. However, two hundred years later, around 1219 AD, Yuan Emperor Genghis Khan also led a large army, entered from the northeast corner of India, and fought a battle with the Afghan king on a plateau in India. The onlookers were the general Indians. Although they inevitably suffered some collateral damage, fortunately, India had plenty of people, and it was not worth anything to die a few of them. This lively event lasted until 1526 AD, when Afghanistan gradually couldn't resist and ended. By 1806, the power of the Mongols had become exhausted, and the direct descendants of the Aryans took advantage of this opportunity, based on the mountains on the western side, and wanted to show off their skills. Unfortunately, the times were not good, and at this time, the potential of the British had been cultivated into a climate within two hundred years (1600-1800), so they rose up greatly. This time, it not only poured a bucket of cold water on the Indians' revival of the country, but also sighed at their bad fate.</p>
<p>However, it was not a one-step process for Britain to dominate India. It took a lot of effort, spying for many years, and going through several twists and turns to achieve their wish. Originally, the first Europeans to arrive in India were the Portuguese, before 1498. One hundred years later, the Dutch, Danes, French, and British came one after another. It seemed that the British came later and surpassed the others, but there was also one of the biggest reasons. Where does the reason lie? It turned out that in 1662, King Charles II of England and the Portuguese princess had a marriage made in heaven. This princess was also generous, and gave the port of Mumbai in India as a dowry to Charles. Charles was especially generous, and in 1668, he gave this bit of dowry to the London East India Company, taking only ten pounds of subsidy per year. The Indian business established an unshakable foundation. Naturally, business prospered from this. At that time, the thorn in the eyes of the British was France. So, in 1744, they found an excuse and had a big fight with the French in India. After seven years, they finally defeated the French. The French had no choice but to make a living under the British, barely supporting themselves for a hundred years. It was not until 1761 that the British East India Company was officially established. In the same year, Afghanistan launched another conquest, which also gave the British a lot of trouble, but they were finally driven out of the country. With great difficulty, in 1857, the British had two-thirds of the Indian territory, and Victoria officially annexed the Indian territory and served as queen. At that time, it was after the Indians' last desperate struggle. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e33">After the National Society Embargo, Rice Prices Suddenly Surge; Citizens Vie to Purchase at High Prices; Today, Rice Shops Universally Sell Corn Flour <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Council announced on the 14th that it would prohibit the import of national rice into the concessions, news spread yesterday that villagers selling rice from the Chinese areas into the concessions have gradually decreased their entry. Simultaneously, those selling within the concessions are treating rice as a scarce commodity, raising prices steeply. Buyers are also competing to stockpile, willing to pay high prices, causing the price of each "dou" (a unit of volume) to soar to 45, 46, or even 50 yuan. In reality, the Rice and Grain Office is still continuing to designate warehouses to supply rice shops with foreign rice for retail sales yesterday to meet demand.</p>
<p>Both Concessions Take the Same Steps</p>
<p>According to announcements from responsible parties within the Shanghai Municipal Council, starting from the 14th of this month, the import of national rice into the International Settlement will be prohibited. The French Municipal Council is also taking the same steps as the Shanghai Municipal Council, restricting the transport of national rice within the French Concession to one "sheng" (another unit of volume). The above regulations will all be implemented from the 14th onwards. The French authorities will formally announce the above notice today.</p>
<p>Regulations for Transporting Rice</p>
<p>After the Rice and Grain Management Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council stipulated the fee payment and deposit methods for rice transportation permits, they issued another notice yesterday stating, "The permit fee for transporting rice or corn flour is one yuan per bag for those transported by handcart" and three yuan per bag for those transported by truck. For distances within three miles, truck transport is strictly prohibited. A separate window has been set up at the Rice and Grain Office's collection point to handle the collection of rice transport permit fees.</p>
<p>Rice Shops Universally Sell Corn Flour Today</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Council announced that it would begin selling corn flour for the first time this Friday (today), all 395 rice shops in both concessions are selling it. This corn flour has been processed and crushed by the Reiss &amp; Co. trading house, with each grain ground into five or six pieces, equal in size to foreign rice. Each person is limited to purchasing one and a half "sheng," costing one yuan and seven jiao in national currency. After the first sale today, it will be sold once every Friday thereafter.</p>
<p>Three Warehouses to Release Rice for Retail Sales Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Rice and Grain Office continued to designate three warehouses yesterday: Jin Yuan No. 2 Warehouse at 129 Wenchixi Road, Ding He at 57 Lane 5, San Tai Road, and He Ji at 41 Lane 8, North Suzhou Road. It is determined that rice can be released today to supply rice shops for retail sales tomorrow. As for the method for retail sales of foreign rice and corn flour next week, foreign rice will be sold on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays, and corn flour will be sold on Fridays, the same as this week.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Dispersing Refugees from Three Shelters by a Deadline <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>The refugee dispersal issue, needing 700,000 in dispersal fees, is being actively pursued by the Refugee Association, the Tzu Lien Hui, and the Refugee Branch, hoping to complete it all within a week after the 15th of this month. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Remaining Number of Refugees in Three Shelters: Apart from the First Refugee Shelter on Xinzha Road, directly managed by the Refugee Association, which houses 4,000 refugees, the Tzu Yuan Shelter on North Zhejiang Road, managed by the Charitable Federation, houses over 4,000 refugees. Additionally, there is a shelter established by the Tzu Lien Branch, housing an undetermined number of refugees, for a total of approximately 10,000 people. All are planned and provided for by the Refugee Association.</p>
<p>Actively Raising Dispersal Funds</p>
<p>Since refugees in all shelters are limited to being fully dispersed by the 15th of this month, the Refugee Association is not only carrying out dispersal procedures but also raising dispersal funds through various means. According to estimates, the total dispersal fee for the three refugee shelters amounts to over 400,000 yuan. The dismissal fees for the three association staff and other closure matters require 300,000 yuan. Charity leaders are expending great effort in this endeavor.</p>
<p>Dispersal to be Completed by Mid-Month</p>
<p>As of yesterday, the total number of refugees dispersed from the shelters has reached between two and three thousand. The remainder will be fully dispersed within the week after the 15th. The Refugee Association also plans to stop providing supplies to all refugee shelters starting from the 16th of this month. Therefore, the refugee problem, which began at the start of the Shanghai Battle and has lasted for four years, will come to an end.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Coal Shops Fined for Exceeding Price Limits <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office announced that the Xin Ya Coal Shop at 252 Liaoyang Road was found to be selling coal balls for 450 yuan per ton, exceeding the Council's limit of 375 yuan. The Price Limit Enforcement Committee decided on the 11th of this month to order the shop to suspend business for four days or pay a fine of 200 yuan. Similarly, the De Lai Coal Shop at 404 Dalianwan Road and the Fang Feilong Coal Shop at 408 on the same road were punished for exceeding price limits on coal ball sales. Furthermore, the Tai He Coal Shop at 542 Wanjanshi Road was selling Hongji coal for 1,000 yuan per ton, exceeding the limit by 400 yuan. The Yuan Sen Coal Shop at 84 Yuanchang Road was selling Hongji coal for 800 yuan per ton. They were ordered to suspend business for five and six days, respectively, or pay fines of 300 yuan and 500 yuan, respectively. In addition, seven smaller coal shops were ordered to suspend business for three days or pay fines of 50 yuan each for exceeding sales limits. The Committee will impose severe penalties on any coal merchants found to violate price limit regulations as a warning.</p>

<p>Since the production of various machine-made coal ball factories has decreased, leading to fears of shortages, the trend has become quite serious, and residents throughout the city are deeply concerned. The Coal Control Committee of both concessions, in order to prevent fuel shortages and facilitate residents' purchase of coal balls needed for daily cooking, has dispatched personnel to various factories to investigate coal reserves and the reasons for reduced production. The investigations have now been completed one after another, and the investigation personnel have reported for verification. It is learned that the Coal Control Committee of both concessions has been actively discussing concrete measures to alleviate fuel shortages in recent days and has made progress. Therefore, the supply of fuel coal balls in the city is expected to gradually improve soon, and universal sales can be expected. However, citizens are strictly prohibited from stockpiling in large quantities to avoid reducing the amount of available goods. If anyone dares to disobey openly or covertly, they will be severely punished without fail.</p>

<p>Mei Hezhang, a native of Changzhou, former judge of the Da Li Yuan (Supreme Court), and currently practicing as a lawyer in Shanghai (also known as Jie Jie, also named Yuan, seventy years old this year), resides at 322 Fu'anfang, Anxijin Road, French Concession. He previously married a Jin woman, Xie, (forty-eight years old this year) as his wife, and they have four sons, all of whom have grown up. Five years ago, due to disagreements between Mei and Xie, they separated, with Mei providing Xie with 38 yuan per month for living expenses. Meanwhile, Mei married another woman, Zhou Yunzhen, as his second wife. Unexpectedly, Mei stopped providing Xie's living expenses, which has lasted for four years. Moreover, with the high cost of living in Shanghai recently, it is difficult for Xie to maintain her livelihood. Therefore, she informed Mei Hezhang, requesting that he pay the full amount of accumulated living expenses and increase the monthly allowance to 50 yuan in the future. Mei ignored her. Therefore, Xie hired a lawyer to sue in court. Mei's defense is that Xie relies entirely on her sons for small living expenses, so there is no need to repeatedly pester an elderly man in his seventies. He requested that Xie's claim be rejected. The court will soon issue a summons for both parties to hear the case.</p>

<p>Exceeding One-Third Compared to Last Year: After the beginning of spring in the city, the weather has been colder than usual, coupled with the prevalence of seasonal illnesses, leading to a sharp increase in the death rate of the population. According to the corpse collection report released by the Tongren Fuyuan Hall yesterday for February, the total number of corpses collected, both adults and children, was 1,525. At the same time, the Pushen Villa collected a total of 2,625 adult corpses and 3,886 child corpses. According to the French Municipal Council, the above-mentioned number of deaths exceeds the previous year's figure by approximately one-third. A portion of the deaths is due to difficulty in finding food and starvation.</p>

<p>As the season for spring floods is approaching, the Shanghai Municipal Council Works Department is also busy with flood control measures. According to the Works Department's work report for February released yesterday, regarding flood control plans for the Central and Northern Districts, the Works Department has installed flood prevention gates at the outlets of major underground drains on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek. This work is currently in progress. A flood prevention slope has been built on the section of Zhaofeng Road in western Shanghai south of Yuyuan Road. Similar flood prevention slopes have also been happily built on the north and south sections of Yidingpan Road along Yuyuan Road. The demolition of the Jiangxi Road Bridge was mostly completed by the end of last month. The remaining bridge piles will also be removed by the successful bidder. The section of the Suzhou Creek near the Wenzhou Road garbage pier has been dredged, and dredging is currently underway in the section near the Macgregor Road garbage pier.</p>

Furthermore, the Chinese police officers who were transferred from the Shanghai Municipal Police to the Special Police Force when it was established last year will also return to the police force on April 15th. However, the strength of the Shanghai West Special Police will not be weakened but will be maintained at 1,440 people through recruitment. The Shanghai West Special Police will become a purely Chinese organization in the future. A total of 64 foreign police officers have been transferred back to the Shanghai Municipal Police from the Special Police Force, including 30 Japanese. Apart from Mr. Kleso, who has served the Shanghai Municipal Council for over 25 years, no others have resigned.</p>

<h3 id="e45">How to Make Self-Sufficient Fertilizer - Ji Siming's Lecture at the YMCA Agricultural Science Seminar <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, China has experienced an extremely serious problem: the food shortage. The flames of war are raging across the Far East, causing widespread devastation. The supply of foreign rice from overseas has been cut off. We feel that increasing food production is particularly important, and agricultural fertilizer has become a problem that must be studied. For example, Germany can produce 10 to 12 "shi" (unit of weight) of wheat per acre, while China only produces about 2 "shi" per acre, a vast difference. This is probably due to planting methods and pests, but the lack of rational fertilizer is the main cause. Plants need fertilizer, just as people need nourishment, and the principle is the same.</p>
<p>Classification of Fertilizers</p>
<p>Plants need a dozen or so kinds of fertilizers, and the most important elements are nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). Fertilizers are classified into self-sufficient fertilizers and commercial fertilizers. Self-sufficient fertilizers, also known as natural fertilizers, can be produced or collected by farmers themselves, such as human manure, stable manure, compost, green manure, and wood ash. Commercial fertilizers, also known as artificial fertilizers, include potassium sulfate, potassium chloride, ammonium sulfate, superphosphate, lime, and soybean cake. Direct fertilizers and indirect fertilizers are classified according to their different effects. For example, soybean cake, potassium sulfate, and sulfuric acid can directly supply plant nutrition and are called direct fertilizers. Lime and gypsum do not contain the necessary components for plant nutrition, but indirectly enable plants to grow well and increase yield, and are called indirect fertilizers. Complete fertilizers and partial fertilizers are analyzed according to whether the contained ingredients are complete or not. Animal-based fertilizers, plant-based fertilizers, mineral fertilizers, and mixed fertilizers are analyzed according to the source of the materials. Animal-based fertilizers are animal corpses and waste products, such as human excrement, stable manure, bone meal, etc. Plant-based fertilizers are plant bodies and residues from plant processing, such as soybean cake, oil cake, grass ash, green manure, etc. Mineral fertilizers are various minerals or chemical products, such as sulfuric acid, potassium sulfate, superphosphate, lime, gypsum. Mixed fertilizers are also known as compound fertilizers, and are made by mixing two or three or more of animal, plant, and mineral fertilizers, such as compost and river mud.</p>
<p>Analysis of Human Manure</p>
<p>China's rural economy is weak, and the country's industry is backward, so chemical fertilizers are very scarce. Therefore, we should focus on natural fertilizers, mainly human manure. According to agricultural statistics, the average amount of urine and feces excreted by each Chinese person per year is 820 "jin" (unit of weight). Due to differences in food, the amount for Europeans and Americans is about 750 "jin." Shanghai has a population of 3 million, so it can be estimated that the annual output of manure is 2.4 trillion "jin." Manure kings sell it to farmers for 1.5 to 1.8 yuan per "dan" (unit of weight), and the total amount is considerable. If the entire population of 500 million in the country is statistically accounted for, it would be a huge source of wealth. As for the nature of human manure, the excrement of the elderly and sick is the best because their digestion is poor and there is more residual protein, which is most valuable for plant nutrition. Children and strong men have strong digestion, and the nutrients in their excrement are weak. Although the working class eats a lot, their digestion is also strong, as is the case with pregnant women and new mothers. Human manure contains a lot of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. The manure pits in the countryside should be enclosed on three sides with walls to prevent evaporation by sunlight and slow down fermentation, so that the nutrients do not evaporate. It is best to add some gypsum to make it ferment slowly. There is less rain in the north, so manure bricks can be made. In the south, where there is more rain, this is unnecessary. In hot summers, when infectious diseases are prevalent, households often add disinfectants such as Lysol and carbolic acid to kill bacteria, which is good, but it is very unfavorable because it hinders plant growth. I think that in the near future, it will be possible to invent a way to disinfect without losing the value of fertilizer and to add fragrances to reduce odor. Disinfection and odor reduction would be convenient for both households and farmers.</p>
<p>Livestock Fertilizer</p>
<p>The ingredients of livestock fertilizer are complex and decompose slowly, so it is called "cold-natured." Horse manure has strong ripening and fermentation power and is most widely used in gardens. Farmers in European countries regard livestock manure as the first kind of self-sufficient fertilizer. They have a common agricultural saying: "No livestock, no fertilizer; no fertilizer, no agriculture." Bone meal is also good. After livestock bones are heated to a high temperature and the fat is dissolved, they are crushed with a heavy press. They contain a lot of phosphorus, which fruit trees need most. There is also green manure. Plants such as soybeans, mustard greens, and wheat are turned into the soil after they have grown and become good fertilizers after a long time. They can be widely used in large quantities. Other materials such as wood ash contain large amounts of potassium carbonate, which promotes rapid germination of seeds and is also a valuable fertilizer. In short, farmers should make full use of natural fertilizers, and with the adjustment of favorable weather and geographical conditions, agricultural production will surely increase, the economy will prosper, and the goals of benefiting the country and the people will be achieved.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Squeeze! <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Yun</p>
<p>Overhead, *zhá zhá zhá*, vying for air supremacy; what's terrifying is that iron birds are laying eggs.</p>
<p>Underground, *zhá zhá zhá*, struggling for survival; what's agonizing is that ducks are seeing bran but can't eat it.</p>
<p>Terror and agony, humanity mostly unwilling to accept, yet people around the world, save for a few isolated corners, are universally tasting these flavors.</p>
<p>Before the east turns white, before the first rooster crows, the moon hangs on the forest's edge, flower shadows shift east, just when one should be sound asleep, dreaming sweet dreams, already one sees by the roadside a wriggling movement, figures flashing, you squeezing me, packed tight beside the closed shop doors. Automatically, in clusters and groups, in lines and rows. If you go only when the sky lightens, not only can you not squeeze to the front, meeting someone you know, they'll laugh at you for arriving so late to squeeze, truly a sleepyhead!</p>
<p>It is just that the heavens are unkind, as if deliberately playing a joke on the group squeezing for survival, sometimes it's a biting wind that cracks your skin, a heavy coat failing to warm; sometimes hailstones and snowflakes come, decorating the early spring scene; sometimes a continuous drizzle and mist, all day long; water pours from the eaves straight to your feet, your spine becoming a drainpipe from heaven to earth; both feet, from the soles, grow cold straight to above your knees, preventing you from moving. Fortunately, with people squeezing forward and pressing behind, you don't need to exert effort, sometimes shifting forward, sometimes retreating, like tides of rice, swaying left and right, so long as you... [missing text] people, behind [missing text] people... [missing text] head, again must resist... [missing text] people, attacking from the sides and front, only then, when the number is written, is your destiny to buy that day decided. You can then loosen the squeeze from front and back, take a breath, spit, call out, "Aiyo!", watching the people ahead, one by one passing [forward], and when it's your turn, you haven't made this trip in vain, achieving your goal of struggling for survival on this day. Most pitiful are those who wait a good few hours, yet can't get a number written, and even with a number, still can't buy anything. Even more unfortunate are those who can't withstand the squeeze, can't block the pushes, and if even half their body is leaning outside, without a word, they're pulled out. No matter how much you plead, you've wasted much time, enduring cold and hunger, unable to retrieve your disappointed, sorrowful heart. On the contrary, those who are aggressive, overbearing, and forcibly insert themselves, and those who have connections, can also push in out of nowhere, buying with smiling faces and leaving, truly enraging you so that smoke pours from your seven orifices, fire igniting in your heart, but ultimately you can do nothing to them: why don't you have the strength, or the connections? You can only blame your own low destiny.</p>
<p>Ah, Mother, squeezing in the rain, squeezing until your chest and back ache, lying in bed, not wanting to eat or drink!</p>
<p>Cai Bin went squeezing the day before yesterday, and unfortunately a large lump rose on his head, making him resemble Confucius, his head like an overturned bowl.</p>
<p>Aiyo, you're really foolish. If you can't be Mu Hong among the 108 heroes of the Water Margin, then you must be Jin Yu Nu's adversary in "Red Silk's Joy," otherwise, forget about going to squeeze.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter, I'm like Yang Qilang, born from heaven, no matter what happens, I'll just treat it like dusting, protect my body.</p>
<p>I hear that the Zhang family's coal ball stove hasn't been lit for many days.</p>
<p>The Li family's sister-in-law says she hasn't tasted oil for three days.</p>
<p>Corn flour porridge is as delicious as the Chang Xiji white japonica rice we used to eat, even sweeter and more fragrant.</p>
<p>Who knew that sorghum flour mixed with green vegetables could be compared to a red-beaked green parrot, equally beautiful.</p>
<p>One by one, item by item, saying how difficult things are: in the end, it's all destiny.</p>
<p>Our Confucius said, "I do not worry about poverty, but about inequality," meaning that quantity should be appropriate, and distribution should be fair.</p>
<p>Our Mencius also said, "The courteous do not insult others, and the thrifty do not steal from others"; it's clear that saving resources means not depriving others of what they like.</p>
<p>Although, this may require you to toil your muscles and bones, starve your body, endure hardship and encourage yourself, not lose your spirit, and still strive to be enterprising. As for the generally pleasure-seeking people, going in and out of singing houses and dance halls, wildly doing speculative business, warning them is not excessive. Especially since they haven't yet felt pain. It is the generally law-abiding, hard-working people who are worried every day, life is truly difficult.</p>
<p>"A sparrow freezes to death on the peak of the Haggan Mountains; why not fly to a place where it's easier to live?" Why couldn't it be so? But... [missing text], where can they entrust themselves? Forcibly telling them to leave their livelihood, where would they find joy? This is called having no choice, suffering thousands of trials and tribulations, only blaming their bad destiny.</p>

<p>Xiang Dongliang, a young man from Jiangbei residing at 24 Dongjing Road, due to his addiction to gambling and associating with bandits, struggled to make ends meet. He then resorted to a life of banditry. Together with accomplices who are at large, including Wang Changfa, Lao Xu, and Xiao Li, at 8:10 PM the day before yesterday, they went to the flour shop opened by Wang Qiujun, a Danyang native, at 305 Wuding Road. Using both soft and hard tactics, they falsely claimed to the shop owner that they were investigators from the Shanghai Municipal Council. They asked why the shop, which had 200 bags of flour, had not registered and demanded 3,000 yuan to avoid trouble; otherwise, the goods would be confiscated and punished. The shop owner was greatly frightened, but the shop only had twenty or so bags of flour and could not pay such a large sum. Xiao Li, who was at large, then pulled out a pistol, aimed it at the shop owner's chest, monitored his actions, and prevented him from speaking out. They began to loot, seizing valuables worth more than 3,000 yuan, rushed out of the door, and fled in different directions. As a result, a shop assistant secretly followed them and reported them to a Western police officer after they entered a lane at Kang Nao Tuo Road on Dongjing Road. The police officer entered the lane with the shop assistant and arrested the thief Xiang. The accomplices took the opportunity to escape with the stolen goods. He was then taken to the Gordon Road Police Station to await investigation.</p>

The day before yesterday afternoon, Xu hid 50 taels of opium, worth nearly 6,000 yuan, in a rice bag. He went to the Huafa border area of Xujiahui Road on Xuxie Road in western Shanghai. First, he threw the cloth bag containing the opium and rice through a gap in the iron gate into the French Concession. Then, he climbed over the wall next to the iron gate. It happened to be spotted by Detective Li Yuyuan, Detective Guo Ruimin, and patrol officers from the French Police Station who were patrolling. They stepped forward and arrested Xu, along with the opium and rice, and brought him to the police station. According to Xu Sibao's confession, a certain Jia, who is now at large, instructed him to deliver the opium to the intersection of Baileinan Road in Caojiadu and hand it over to the client.

He married Yuan Lianxie, the granddaughter of Yuan Shuangqiu (Chang), a prominent official of the late Qing Dynasty. Yuan was known for her extensive social circle in Qingdao and was even elected Miss Qingdao. As a result, she enjoyed a considerable reputation in social circles. She has been married for many years and has a daughter who is already sixteen years old. Later, she and her husband came to Shanghai to seek refuge. Dr. Liu also established a clinic at No. 113 Jiujiang Road, catering mostly to British and American expatriates, earning a substantial monthly income. However, the relationship between the couple has always been very weak. Recently, Liu became intimately involved with Gao Ruilan, a well-known socialite currently in the United States, and cohabitated with Chen Lili, a famous dancer in the city, even having a child with her. This matter was discovered by Yuan. She went to catch them in the act of adultery with a lawyer and the police. Because Liu claimed American citizenship, he was not taken to the police station. Yuan then filed for divorce from Liu according to law and demanded 100,000 yuan in alimony. After two summonses, it is now known that the two parties have reached a reconciliation through the mediation of relatives and friends.

<p>Beware of Fake Telegrams. Recently, unscrupulous people have come up with strange ideas. They come to the door with a note, falsely claiming that there is a telegram or letter sent to a certain place. They issue a receipt at the time and ask for 20 to 30 yuan in national currency, instructing the recipient to go to a certain place to pick it up with the note. In fact, there is no such thing. Unaware people are often deceived by this. Readers are advised to be careful in the future. Do not pay unless you have received a telegram or message. Qi Wenjie</p>
<p>Alone in Shanghai, Sick. My friend, Mr. Zhang, is 23 years old and unmarried. After being ill last month, his legs suddenly became sore and painful, and his hands became numb. Later, he sought treatment from a traditional Chinese medicine doctor, who diagnosed it as rheumatism entering the bones and muscles. He took medicine for days without any effect. The numbness in his hands became even worse, and his feet were bent and unable to touch the ground, just like the paralysis of an elderly person. Mr. Zhang is a lonely traveler far from home, with no relatives to turn to. He is suffering from this strange disease and is at a loss. Therefore, he is borrowing your newspaper to humbly seek the advice of famous doctors in Shanghai on good medicine or to introduce specialists in mental disorders for diagnosis and treatment.

<h3 id="e61">A Brief History of Chinese Stamps <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— Kong Zhen</p>
<p>Stamp collecting is now almost a very common and ordinary pastime in Shanghai, but in the past it was not the case. Everyone thought that stamp collecting was a luxurious activity, and they would not hesitate to spend hundreds of gold coins to buy them. Therefore, there is such a saying in Western proverbs, that is, "Postage is the king of pastimes, and the pastime of kings," which means that only famous public figures and dignitaries are worthy of being "stamp collectors," and ordinary people cannot collect stamps. But today it is not the case. From the head of a country to people of any profession, anyone can collect stamps. The most famous stamp collectors are U.S. President Roosevelt, former U.S. President Hoover, and the late British King George V, etc. There are also many male and female stars in Hollywood who are fond of this. U.S. Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes said: "Stamp collecting is a decisive event in a person's day. It is very helpful for those who are tired from work, because in their spare time, casually flipping through a stamp album can rejuvenate their spirits. It is even more beneficial for education, as it can increase the infinite interest of innocent children in history and geography." From this, we can see the interest of stamp collecting. The postage stamps of various countries in the world were first created in England (in 1840 AD, around the 20th year of Daoguang in the Qing Dynasty). China adopted this method very late. It was not until the fourth year of Guangxu that official postage stamps were in general use, so China's postal history is very short (with the exception of small countries that were newly established after the European War). The trend of stamp collecting did not have more collectors until the fifth or sixth year of the Republic of China, so stamp shops should have been opened since that time.</p>
<p>The official postage stamps of China issued in the former Qing Dynasty included dragon patterns, goose patterns, and several commemorative stamps, such as the Xuantong Enthronement, Empress Dowager Cixi's Longevity Picture, etc. During the warlord era, Zhang Zuolin also issued postage stamps of the Grand Marshal of the Army and Navy, but this type of postage stamp was only used in the few provinces under his jurisdiction, so it was rare on the market and the price was very high. Many commemorative stamps were issued in the twenties of the Republic of China, such as Sun Yat-sen's state funeral, the Restoration Commemoration, the Tan Yankai Commemoration, the Constitution Commemoration stamps, the Republican Commemoration, the New Life Movement, etc. Ordinary postage stamps were almost all portraits of Sun Yat-sen, portraits of martyrs, etc., but in the twentieth year of the Republic of China, an interesting incident occurred with the Sun Yat-sen stamps, that is, the difference between the so-called single circle and double circle. Because the postage stamps at that time were entrusted to the De La Rue &amp; Co. to print, the Westerners did not understand the meaning of the Kuomintang party emblem, and they actually added a circle to the white sun, including the seven types of 1-cent, 2-cent, 4-cent, 2-jiao, 1-yuan, 2-yuan, and 5-yuan. These were commonly known as the double-circle stamps of the Sun Yat-sen portrait. Although the government ordered corrections by telegram, many of them were already in general use outside. In 1939, the "150th Anniversary Commemorative Stamps of the United States" were also issued. At the end of June last year, the "Frugality and National Construction Stamps" were issued.</p>
<p>Shanghai is the largest commercial port in the country, so it is also the general distribution center for the stamp collecting market in the country, so even slight changes can affect the entire country. Stamp shops in Shanghai are scattered everywhere, and books on stamps are also emerging day by day, but the prices are expensive, so stamp collecting is a difficult task in this year!</p>

<p>News from Hong Kong's football community has attracted the attention of Shanghai football fans. Feng Jingxiang, Meng Yiliang, Cai Shengsen, etc., have decided to come to Shanghai. Whether they can arrive this week is still uncertain. As for Li Huitang, etc., we received a letter yesterday from Mr. Wang of St. John's University, stating that he is still in Hong Kong, which will be welcome news to fans. Here is the letter: Today, I read in your newspaper that Feng Jingxiang, etc., will come to Shanghai from Hong Kong, which is very gratifying. However, regarding the whereabouts of Li Huitang, I learned that he is still safe in Hong Kong, because I recently returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong. Before leaving Hong Kong (about two weeks ago), I personally saw Mr. Li on Queen's Road. I have also seen other Shanghai players, such as Xu Wenkui, Cao Qiuting, etc., all in good health. Can you tell the football fans in Shanghai about this? Li Yichen is also still in Hong Kong and is also doing well. The last football game in Hong Kong was on December 7th (Sunday) last year, approximately between the Eastern team and the Engineers. Because the situation has become tense, it was not held. Also, Cai Huiquan, who performed tennis in Hong Kong before, and his American partner Hammon are still in Hong Kong. Tao Guanqiu (i.e., Tao Mao Nü) is probably still living at Mr. Xu's place, and his skills have greatly improved.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Sugar Prices Rise Daily <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, sugar prices have seen new records due to the gradual and rapid rise of military currency. The current market price for 24 coarse white sugar is 65.75 yuan in military currency, and Dutch red sugar is 60.075 yuan. However, the combined price for coarse white sugar has reached 460 yuan, and the situation for other types of sugar can be inferred from this. There has also been buying and selling of cooperative sugar shares recently. Yesterday, coarse white sugar shares initially traded at 240 yuan, then rose to 255 yuan. Red sugar shares rose from 232 yuan to 250 yuan. The sugar supplied to retailers for this month has been fully distributed, totaling 30,000 bags, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Dried Lily Bulbs Rise Again <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Due to low sales and market stability, dried lily bulbs have attracted considerable attention from hoarders. As a result, the market rose again yesterday. The highest-quality goods reached 180 yuan in the market yesterday, an increase of 20 to 30 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Xianglian Lotus Seeds Maintain Strong Uptrend <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Because the source of Xianglian lotus seeds is related to the transportation of military currency, market prices have risen sharply again. Prices have been raised by more than 100 yuan in recent days, and the market price yesterday was 750 yuan, with signs of further tightening.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Summer Woolen Fabrics and Textiles Rise Even More <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the supply of woolen fabrics and textiles has become very tight. Because the Mao Textile Production and Sales Union organized by the Sihui trade has been formally established, the restriction on movement has not become a reality. There is a lot of hot money in Shanghai, and outside hoarders are increasing their activity. Major wholesalers within the industry all treat their goods like treasures and are mostly unwilling to offer prices. Tailors are showing great interest, and merchants from Shanghai and Nanjing are actively purchasing. Single operators from various routes are active, resulting in a shortage of goods in the market, and prices continue to soar. The intensity of the price increases can be said to be the first time seen this year. The price increases for summer goods are particularly sharp, because the supply is even more scarce and the demand is even greater. Yesterday, Ewo's power strips were being wholesaled for 63 yuan per yard (the opening price was 45 yuan, and they were only selling for 38 or 39 yuan last year). Zhanghua's patterned Fanding fabric was being sold for 75 yuan per yard (the red-market price was 65 yuan, and they were only selling for 53 or 55 yuan last year). Baoxin's ramie cloth was being sold for 5.8 yuan (the red-market price was 5 yuan, and they were only selling for 3.7 to 3.8 yuan last year), which can also be used to assess the speed of the price increases.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Cigarettes Fly High <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Cigarette prices continue to rise sharply, because military currency continues to rise, and people in all quarters are optimistic. Those who hold goods are even more eager to sell, so prices are soaring. The selling price for Great Britain brand cigarettes has reached 8,400 yuan per case, Old Knife brand is 7,400 yuan, Five Flowers brand is 4,900 yuan, Pinhai brand is 6,700 yuan, and Little Fairy brand is 5,000 yuan. The price increases for Japanese cigarettes are the most sharp, with Golden Gun brand reaching 2,450 yuan, Golden Building is 2,700 yuan, Red Rose brand is 3,600 yuan, and Quanlu brand is 2,850 yuan. 25,000 cigarettes have soared by more than 400 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Soap and Matches Rise Even More <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The price of soap is rising sharply, and the selling prices of various brands have broken previous records. Sales are becoming more robust, and the market cannot be restrained. The selling price for Jigu Ben brand soap is 230 yuan per case, Baixiangmao brand soap is 220 yuan, and Huangxiangmao brand soap is 205 yuan. Matches are also popular, with Phoenix brand selling for 2,900 yuan per case and Beauty brand selling for 3,000 yuan, an increase of 300 yuan compared to before.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Bananas (4) <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>As for the current most popular name, "Xiangjiao" (香蕉 - banana), known to all women and children, where did it come from? It originally only appeared in the *Gazetteer of Panyu County*. In the section on products, it says: "Jiao (蕉, banana), ...there are three types: 'Qingya' (靑牙, green sprout), 'Huangya' (黃牙, yellow sprout), and 'Xiangjiao' (香蕉, fragrant banana), which is fragrant and delicious." It can be seen that "Xiangjiao" was just a unique name among many types, and now it has become the general representative of this fruit. Even a slight change in name must follow the times: Suppose someone now goes to a fruit store to buy "Ganjiao" (甘蕉, sweet banana) or "Jiaozi" (蕉子, banana), they would probably stare blankly, not knowing what to do! The *Gazetteer of Panyu County* also records other types, saying: "There is a type called 'Goupanzi' (狗攀子, dog-climbing banana), a small plant that a short dog can climb, with a bland and cheap taste. There is another type with very large fruit, steamed and fed to children as a substitute for milk, called 'Weizaijiao' (喂仔蕉, baby-feeding banana). All bananas are cold in nature and should not be eaten in large quantities, except for 'Weizaijiao,' which is harmless when cooked...". From the *Illustrations and Studies of Plant Names* by Wu Qirong, citing records from *Lingnan Miscellany*, we know that bananas also have the vulgar and unseemly names "Bangchuijiao" (棒槌蕉, club banana) and "Gouyajiao" (狗牙蕉, dog-tooth banana), and even the gorgeous and charming "Rose Banana" that "smells like roses." Furthermore, from the *Notes from Southern Yue* cited by it, we can also know that "...'Xiangyajiao' (香牙蕉, fragrant sprout banana) is considered the most beautiful, also called 'Longnai' (龍奶, dragon milk)—milk, like the milk of a dragon, rare and precious!..." There are many other names, which can be confusing for a while, waiting for someone with a passion to continue the *Tea Manual*, *Lychee Manual*... and create a "Banana Manual."</p>
<p>According to the classification method of foreign botanists, bananas can be divided into three types: The first type is the Musa paradisiaca mentioned earlier, with large fruits that cannot be eaten raw, but can only be cooked as dishes; this probably corresponds to the "Banjiao" (板蕉, board banana), "Weizaijiao" (喂仔蕉, baby-feeding banana), or "Bangchuijiao" (棒槌蕉, club banana), etc., mentioned above. The second type is called Musa pasientnm, with smaller and more delicious fruits; the third type is called Musa sinensis—the Chinese banana—with short trunks and fragrant and sweet fruits; both of these can be eaten raw and should correspond to the "Yangjiaojiao" (羊角蕉, goat-horn banana), "Fozhi" (佛指, Buddha-finger banana), or "Longnaijiao" (龍奶蕉, dragon-milk banana), etc., mentioned earlier. But where is the difference between the second and third types? The second type has slightly larger fruits with thicker skin, which can last a long time and travel far, and the handling during transportation is simple, without the need for special equipment. As for the Chinese banana, it is easily perishable. Extra care must be taken when loading it onto ships and trains, such as wrapping it in cotton or putting it in cold storage. Therefore, the wealthy merchants who sell fruit, especially the British, prefer to transport the second type of banana.</p>
<p>The "raw swallow and live peel" so-called raw eating method of bananas is what everyone - speaking of people in Shanghai! - is accustomed to "tasting" and most familiar with, so there is no need to describe it. As for the cooked eating methods of bananas, it was mentioned earlier that "Weizaijiao" is steamed and then given to children to eat; now: There are two popular ways to eat bananas in northern Chinese restaurants: one is to cook it clear with rock sugar and milk sauce, and the other is to coat the banana with flour and then fry it in soybean oil. I think the famous chefs in Guangdong must have many new tricks, but unfortunately, there is no way to inquire about it! Furthermore, according to records from the biological world, the chefs in the West Indies in America have truly all kinds of ways to cook bananas, with endless variety, extravagance, and grandeur, which people in the Old World would never dare to aspire to. Moreover, the industry of drying bananas and making flour is on the rise, and in the future, we may see "banana flour" on the market in addition to lotus root flour, water chestnut flour... to supply our needs. As for making beverages and canned goods with bananas... it is well known to everyone. It is said that in Guyana, northern South America, people also make a kind of banana wine that is very popular among black people!</p>
<p>Each banana plant only conceives once in its life, producing one bunch, and its fruit cannot develop mature seeds, so how does it avoid the disaster of reducing species and becoming extinct? It is that the new buds under the roots of the mother plant's flower spike emerge vigorously; waiting for the mother plant to bloom and bear fruit and become something that is obtained only to be discarded, - usually people chop it off immediately - then its children can stand tall. If one acre of banana field has one thousand banana plants, harvesting twice a year - one each from the mother plant and the daughter plant - yields about two thousand bunches of fruit, each weighing twenty-five kilograms. With diligent irrigation and plenty of fertilizer, the number can be doubled. Now bananas in Shanghai sell for one or two jiao (角 - a unit of money) each, so the interest is very generous!</p>

<h3 id="e76">Food <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Mo</p>
<p>The *Strategies of the Warring States* says: "In the state of Chu, food is more valuable than jade, and firewood is more valuable than cassia. Now I eat jade and burn cassia." Today, the hardship of livelihood touches upon all aspects upon reading this. Therefore, concerning food and drink, I restate several points.</p>
<p>Confucius taught people to plan for the Way and not for food. However, Mrs. Confucius may have felt that even the cleverest woman cannot cook without rice. Therefore, Confucius could not help but sigh that only when clothing and food are sufficient can one know propriety and righteousness, and that eating, drinking, men, and women are the great desires of human beings, and no one does not know taste. Although he also said that a gentleman does not seek satiety in eating or comfort in dwelling, at least seeking half-satiety in eating, even if it cannot prolong life, is still a way to extend years. Therefore, when ancient people talked about food, their conclusion was simply "the people regard food as heaven." When the Queen Zhao Wei asked the envoy from Qi, "Is the year also well? Are the people also well? Is the king also well?" "If there is no year, how can there be people? If there are no people, how can there be a king?" This is also enough to show how much the ancient people valued the people's food. Han Yu's Miscellaneous Sayings says, "Therefore, even if there is a famous horse, if it is not fed enough and lacks strength, how can one expect it to travel a thousand miles?"</p>
<p>Looking at the past from today, and looking at the present from the future, there are many who produce, and few who eat; if those who produce are few, and those who eat are many, how can we ignore or forget this timeless and unchangeable famous argument?</p>
<h3 id="e77">A Head Has Value <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— R Yang</p>
<p>The red, white, and blue barber pole at the entrance of the barbershop is now spinning even more vigorously. Originally, during this time of soaring prices for coal, rice, oil, and salt, barber fees have also been catching up "head"long.</p>
<p>Don't mention those forty or fifty yuan "air-conditioned Kleram-Lei perms," even ordinary haircuts require two banknotes of illegal tender with just a slight bow of the head. Although this shows that "a head has value," thinking about it, it always seems a bit "uneconomical." - Sitting like being in jail for an hour or two, with one's head being tossed around, watching those strands of hair "received from one's parents" being recklessly ruined by ruthless scissors; such a loss, and still having to pay money at the end, it's really hard to explain!</p>
<p>Save some money and go for a trim a few days later, although it won't reach the level of "three thousand feet of white hair," that look of "hair bristling in anger" is a bit unsightly and truly deserves a spectacle; and, it is said to be unsanitary! - However, some so-called artists are an exception. Their beehive-like hairdos are highly praised, the only reason being that they are artists, and the demeanor of an artist must be "extraordinary."... This kind of demeanor is now causing envy among some people.</p>
<p>Sitting in the chair in the barbershop, looking at my head being molested in the mirror, I thought about these things in a disorderly manner. Suddenly, I remembered that funny verse: "Try looking at the barber, people also shave his head," and I couldn't help but feel that it had a rather profound meaning, and I began to enter into reverie.</p>
<h3 id="e78">According to What I've Seen <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong</p>
<p>On the filthy sidewalk, there was a puddle of vomit residue near the wall, and a black dog sniffed it and ran away. Then came a disheveled female beggar, draped in a sack, greedily grabbing the gray grains of rice and sending them to her mouth, making it her meal in no time!</p>
<p>At the entrance of a lumberyard, there lay a dying beggar, his face ginger yellow, constantly shaking his head, seemingly making a final struggle with death. The lumberyard boss came out to scold him, drive him away, pull him, and kick him. Finally, he had no choice but to give him two mao (毛 - a unit of money) to ask him to leave. The money fell on the ground, and the beggar lay still, stiff, and died.</p>
<p>A young and very handsome young man had just come out of a tea and snack shop, holding a package of biscuits. With a turn, the biscuits were snatched away, and his hat also fell to the ground. The young man flew after them, catching the thief, who hadn't had time to open the package, and punching and kicking him, extraordinarily brave, not even wanting his hat anymore. As a result, the biscuits were crushed on the ground, and the thief lay there, sobbing, willing to return the biscuits.</p>
<p>The bystanders all said in unison: "So-so, picking up the hat is more important," but this young man seemed to think that the biscuits and hat could be abandoned, but this anger could not be left unvented.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Eastern Spiritual Civilization <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— Gongji</p>
<p>To say "strolling through the market" to someone living in Beijing is as "leisurely" as saying "going to Guanqian" to someone living in Suzhou. The market refers to Dong'an Market, while Guanqian is the name of a street. From the word "strolling" (逛) in "strolling through the market," we can know that it doesn't necessarily mean going to buy things. And friends who go to Guanqian are mostly with mouths full of pine nut candy or sunflower seeds. Their purpose is just to "stroll" or "walk around" to pass the time that cannot be gotten rid of. For example, a Beijing resident who lives off rental income (commonly known as "eating tiles"), gets up early, goes to Central Park or Beihai Park for a stroll, hides in the depths of pines and cypresses, and practices a bit of Tai Chi. Then, he sits in a teahouse, orders a pot of "fragrant tea" or "Longjing," and chats with friends he sees every day. At noon, they take turns being the "host" at a small restaurant: four liang (兩 - a unit of weight) of baijiu (white liquor), a few steamed buns, a few plates of assorted stir-fried dishes, buying a drunken and satisfied meal. Drunkenly, he runs to Liulichang to sit in antique shops and talk in calligraphy and painting shops. When spring comes, he goes to Chongxiao Temple to see peonies. When autumn comes, he goes to West Mountain to admire maple leaves. Day by day, he transforms himself from a remnant young man into a remnant old man. A Suzhou resident who lives off farmland, the first thing he does after getting out of bed is to go to a teahouse. He eats a snack such as pig trotter noodles or shrimp and crab noodles. He adds embellishments and details to gossip. After lunch, he either goes to Guanqian to listen to storytelling or gathers four people in a teahouse to play mahjong. Life seems like a slapstick comedy, opening in laughter and closing in laughter. Some people use these two ways of life to represent the "spiritual civilization" of the East. The former life is like a light and tranquil "poem." The latter life is like a lively and funny "drama." Some people who go to Beijing are reluctant to leave, saying that there is a "blue sky" there. Others who go to Suzhou are unwilling to leave, saying that there is a "lovely Qiuxiang" (Qiuxiang is the main character in the "Three Smiles" story). In Shanghai, there is neither a "blue sky" nor a "lovely Qiuxiang." But if you are interested, you can discover another way of life of Eastern "spiritual civilization." Walking on the road are pairs of young men and women, so young that you can estimate that they have not graduated from university. The woman's arm is tightly hooked on the man's, hooking the man's shoulder a bit high and a bit low. One foot high and one foot low, they jump out of the movie theater and into the cafe; run out of the cafe and shrink into the dance hall again. They are as busy as a "zoetrope." It is said that there is nothing to read, let alone that their families do not need them to "mill rice"? This seems to be another kind outside of the two kinds of "spiritual civilization" lifestyle.</p>

<p>(2) Sorrow and Joy</p>
<p>Wei Cheng was sitting on the edge of the bed, his body leaning, as Mrs. Ye Da stretched a dry hand out from under the covers. Everyone asked her what she wanted. He Ma flashed in, not knowing when. She said, "Second young mistress, why don't you feed her a spoonful of water?" The second young mistress fed Mrs. Ye Da a spoonful of ginseng-infused soup, very peacefully. Her hand was still stretched out. Wei Cheng said, "I know, Mom always likes to stroke my hair, she only thinks I'm still a five or six-year-old child." Wei Cheng lowered his head to bring it closer to his mother's hand. Mrs. Ye Da opened her hand and did indeed stroke the back of Wei Cheng's head. Only Wei Cheng noticed that his mother's hand had no strength at all. It wasn't stroking, but just pressing the palm of her hand against it.</p>
<p>He Ma saw that it was okay to speak and said, "Young master, the maternal uncle said that he is asking the young master to go outside so that Mr. Huang can write the prescription. The maternal uncle has something to discuss with the young master." Wei Cheng was still reluctant to part. The eldest and second young mistresses both said, "Mr. Huang won't wait. He is a famous doctor. Getting a number so early and inviting him out, only Shidetang (世德堂) could invite him. He has given us great face. Wei Cheng, go quickly." Wei Cheng put Mrs. Ye Da's hand inside the covers and pressed it once on the surface of the covers before standing up and walking out. Cui Zhen didn't know what she said to the eldest young mistress. The eldest young mistress said, "Wei Cheng, when you go outside, don't let the tears flow and wipe your eyelids with a handkerchief." Wei Cheng said, "I know." Cui Zhen handed over a handkerchief. She was still holding a tray of foreign candles in her hand.</p>
<p>The sky was clear and the sun was bright, but inside the house, there was only a dismal fog and gloomy clouds. He Ma led Wei Cheng to a room opposite the Shuangmei Study, where he saw Huang Shipu holding a water pipe, using smoking to ponder; on one side was Li Youxie, and on the other was Second Mrs. Ye; the table was covered with writing brushes and paper. Li Youxie urged: "Wei Cheng, you've come. Mr. Huang originally refused to write a prescription, but now Second Sister-in-law and I have strongly persuaded him. Mr. Huang has already written one here on the prescription. But Mr. Huang also has something to say to you." Wei Cheng nodded to Huang Shipu. (21)</p>

<p>— Zefu</p>
<p>It is said that Yangge originated in Ding County, Hebei, and was created by Su Dongpo in the Song Dynasty. The farmers near Heilong Spring in Ding County mostly grew rice. Every time it was time for transplanting rice seedlings, the farmers would sing this kind of song to relieve their labor, so it was named Yangge (transplanting song). In the beginning, it was just short songs, and it is still so in the Beijing area today. When singing, one must step on sturdy wood, called Gaoqiao (high stilts). (Some say that this is the original intention of preventing mud from splashing on the rice fields.) Each song has four lines, each line with seven characters, linked together to form a story. Later, it was transformed into a performance, without the use of stilts, purely a dramatic form. In addition to being popular in Ding County, the Shandong and Shanxi areas also had their traces. The roles include the elderly male, young male, young female, painted face, and clown. The instruments include the gong, drum, cymbals, and small cymbals, without the accompaniment of string and bamboo instruments, which still preserves the original form. The plays performed are mostly love affairs between men and women and family trivia, such as "Blue Bridge Meeting," "Ding Lang Seeking His Father," "Brick Topping," etc., which are quite popular with the general public. However, the lyrics sometimes involve obscenity, so they are sometimes banned by local authorities. In recent years, those engaged in this profession have wanted to reform it, so they adopted Peking Opera and adapted new plays, such as "Guan Wang Temple" and "Sitting in the Building Killing Xi," but looking at the themes, it is still difficult to escape its original form.</p>

<p>The business in the foreign firm has already stopped. Although the foreign masters are crestfallen, their lives are not yet in trouble. The compradors (Chinese managers), who have always considered themselves high-class Chinese and are skilled at maneuvering, naturally also have ways. The most bitter are those in our class, who are neither high nor low, of coolie laborers.</p>
<p>According to the current prices, if the rice bowl is not broken, we can barely get by. Now that we have become unemployed vagrants, if we don't return to our hometowns, we will only starve to death. But going home also requires travel expenses. We have already been cutting flesh to heal sores, moving east and west, so now we are naturally unable to find help. Thinking over and over, we can only ask the foreign masters and high-class Chinese to show mercy and give us several months of severance pay.</p>
<p>More than a dozen poor colleagues gathered together and debated the issue of severance pay. Some advocated asking for six months, some advocated three months, but some also advocated one year. Just as everyone was discussing, the comprador came slowly.</p>
<p>Although he was worried in his heart, he wore a smile on his face, and his attitude when talking to us had changed from that of a superior to that of a friend. First, he described in detail and with tears the various pains and losses he had suffered. Then, he talked about how much he sympathized with us, wishing he could take on the burden of life for us. But in the end, he was unable to do what he wanted and unable to help.</p>
<p>Among the poor colleagues, there were also those who had suffered grievances on weekdays. Today, since the rice bowl has already been broken anyway, they began to complain "like a river breaking its banks." They said that he had never cared about our lives on weekdays, and now he "doesn't care about the dead." Some even said, "You have been a comprador for ten years, and your family assets are over a million. This million in assets is all from the labor and effort of our colleagues. Now you should take out some to help us."</p>
<p>These words naturally made the comprador uncomfortable. At the time, there were many people talking at once, and it was difficult to distinguish the arguments clearly, and he was not allowed to show a stern face. Fortunately, there were a few good people who did their best to suppress the anger, and at the same time urged the comprador to reconsider, agreeing to talk again at a later date. In the end, they didn't make things awkward. However, the road ahead is long. If we continue to fight hard like this, I'm afraid we will eventually get the boot!</p>

<p>It's a pity that this "he" was unfortunately abandoned by the woman "he loved," and painfully transferred his love to a small dog "he originally hated."

<p>When Mr. Wang in the front building talked to people about the problem of life, he would definitely say: "There are too many children, and the standard of living is so high. My meager income makes it quite difficult to maintain the family's life." Indeed, there are seven children in his family. Counting him and his wife, there are nine people. Eating two bowls of rice per meal, one dan (石 - a unit of volume) of rice a month is "more than enough." The expense of rice alone is already close to three hundred yuan. Counting the other expenses, thirty-one plus thirty-one, it would naturally be four or five hundred yuan a month. In this year, earning this amount of money is indeed not easy. He said: "If it were just my wife and me, wouldn't the expenses be much less?" After speaking, he sighed repeatedly and spoke in a tone of scolding the children. Also, the second landlord's wife often used the excuse of having many children to increase the rent, and sometimes, if the children made a little noise, she would start scolding loudly. Therefore, Mr. Wang always frowned. When he was annoyed, he treated the children as vents, scolding them "to death," sometimes even hitting them hard. "Big creditors, small creditors." This is the common expression that he and his wife used to call their children, especially Mr. Wang. Looking at it this way, do they dislike having too many children?</p>
<p>Recently, I often heard Mrs. Wang in the front building "gagging! gagging!" sounds of vomiting. According to Mom, she is pregnant.</p>
