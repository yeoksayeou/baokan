<h3>明末金尼閣携來之　七千部西書</h3>
<p>— 徐宗澤</p>
<p>明淸之際，耶穌會士來吾國，於傳敎之外，輸入西洋科學，而吾國學術界上頓呈一種異彩。梁啟超先生曰：「明朝以八股取士，一般士子，除了永樂皇帝欽定的性理大全外，幾乎一書不讀，學界本身，本來就像貧血症的人衰弱得可憐。……利瑪竇，龐迪我，熊三拔，龍華民，鄧玉函，湯瑪諾，羅雅谷，艾儒略，湯若望等，自萬曆末年，至天啟崇禎間，先後入中國：中國學者如徐文定，李凉庵，都和他們來往，對於各種學問有精深之硏究，……在這種新環境之下。學界風氣，當然變換。後此淸朝一代舉者，對於曆算學都有興味，而且最喜歡談經世致用之學，大概受利徐諸人的影響不小」。（中國近三白年學術史頁十三，十四）旨哉斯言。</p>
<p>雖然，西士灌進科學，其功固在溝通中西文化，然其精深之硏究，即譯書之運動，亦當一述及之。西士譯書之運動，開始於利瑪寶徐光啟之譯幾何原本：而其擴大之工作，自金尼閣司鐸從歐西携來七千部書籍為始。</p>
<p>金尼閣P．Nleol．Trigault字四表杜愛人，生於一五七七年，一五九四年入耶穌會，一六一〇年秋抵澳門，翌年春至南京；時中國耶穌會會長龍華民，以中國敎務逐漸發展，需人赴羅馬，報告耶穌會總會長中國傳敎事務，幷請遣派敎士來華，乃命金公四行。一六一二年，金公自南京首途，抵澳門，一六一三年春，乘輪出發，一六一四年冬，抵羅馬，入覲敎皇保祿五世，奏陳敎務，幷請准繙譯經典；又見耶穌會總會長。事畢，公週遊歐洲，乘機晉謁拳敎各國當道，詳述在華傳敎情形，幷宜揚中國文化。一六一八年四月，公與同會士二十二人起程離歐，一六二〇年七月二十二日始抵澳門，携歸敎皇所賜之西書七千餘部，裝訂精美，　異中書。一時吾國奉敎學者，若徐光啟，李之藻，楊廷筠，王徵等，俱歡忻無已，亟思一一翻譯，俾歐洲科學，盡量輸入吾國；今從其已譯之書序中，可以窺見當時譯書運動之一斑焉。</p>
<p>先是徐光啟於一六〇三年領洗後，與西士多有往來，親炙其言論，思將西士携來之書籍，（非金公携歸之書），藉同志而迻譯：徐子跋利瑪賽之二十五言曰：「間請其（利子所譯書數種，受而卒業；其從國中携來諸經書盈篋，未及譯，不可得讀也。自來京師，論著復少；此二十五言，成於留都；今年夏，楚憲馮先生請以付黎棗，傳之其人，是所謂萬分之一也；然大義可覩矣。余更請之曰：先生所携經書中，微言妙義，海涵地負，誠得同志數輩，相共傳譯，使人人飫聞至論，獲厥本原，且得竊其緒餘，以裨益民用，斯亦千古大快也」。（萬曆甲辰公元一六〇四年）</p>
<p>徐光啟有此譯書之請求，而利瑪賽答以；「翻譯經義，今茲未遑，子姑待之耳。」蓋西士之來吾國，原為宣揚聖敎，若以譯著是務恐人誤會其不遠千里而來，專為鼓吹形下之學，而於榮主救靈超性之功，反置不講，故似有難色。此意徐子亦瞭解明白，故其序態三拔泰西水法云：「格物窮理之中，又復旁出一種象數之學。象數之學，大者為歷法，為律呂，至其他有形有質之物，有度有數之事，無不賴以為用，用之無不盡巧極妙者。昔與利先生遊，嘗為我言。……迄余服關　朝，而先生已長逝矣。間以請於態先生，唯唯者久之，察其心神，殆無吝色也，而顧有怍色，余因私揣焉。無吝色也者，諸君子講學論道，所求者無非福國庇民；矧茲土苴以為人豈不視猶蔽蓰哉。有怍色者，深恐此法盛傳，天下後世視以公輸墨翟，即非其數萬里東來，捐頂踵冒危難，牖世兼善之意耳。」（萬歴壬子，公元一六一二）</p>
<p>徐光啟旣倡譯書之議於前，及金尼閣携歸七千部書籍，而此議復盛興於後。李之藻序艾儒略職方外紀曰。「金子者實彼國書籍七千餘部，欲貢之蘭臺麟室，參會東西之學術者也。德之庥明，奎　炳瑞；時則有异國異書，梯航九萬里而來；蓋擴古於今為烈，聖主崇文，第今得廣致羣英，分曹摘槧，以盡傾海嶽之奇乎。！」（天啟癸亥，一六二三年）</p>
<p>又楊廷筠序艾儒略西學凡云：「所稱六科經籍，約略七千餘部，業已航海而來，且在可譯，此豈蔡愔玄奘諸人近採印度諸國，寂寂數簡，所可當之者乎。」（天啟癸亥，一六二三年）</p>
<p>楊廷筠代疑續編「原同」中亦曰：「噫，七千部之西來，非偶然也；編摩　繹，是異是同；吾儕自受衷來，烱烱靈明必不能昧，亦在乎靜心以求，虛心以翕受之耳。」</p>
<p>李之澡序寰有詮亦曰：「景敎來自貞禮，常年書殿翻譯經典頗多，後人妄加改竄，以歸佛藏。……我明大開景運，聖聖相承，道化翔洽於八烻？名賢薦瑞於上國；時則有利瑪實浮槎開九萬之程，旣又有金公尼閣載書踰萬部之富，乾坤琿其靈秘，光岳煥彼精英；將寰進闕廷，鼓吹聖敎，文明之，蓋千古未有者。……而此編）有詮）第論有形之性，猶其盛淺者。余自癸亥（一六二三年）歸田，即從傅公汎際，結廬湖上，形神並式，研論本始。每舉一義，輙幸得未曾有，心眼為開；遂忘年力之邁，矢佐繙繹，誠不忍當吾世失之。而惟是文言　絕，喉轉棘生，屢因困難閣筆；乃先就諸有形之類，摘取形天土水氣火所名五大有而創譯焉。是編竣而修士於中土文言理會者多，後此亦能暢其所欲言矣。於是乃取推論名理之書，而嗣譯之。」（崇禎元年，一六二八年）</p>
<p>從上所言，可知金尼閣帶來之書約有七干餘部；然書籍之種類未曾明言，必不外關於聖敎，神哲學，天文，地理，曆算及一切科學之書而已。此種書籍，起初留在澳門，嗣後絡續運入內地，特別是在北京。一六二三年後，似已開始選譯，李之藻之寰有詮序已隱約言之。而李子努力譯書，至老靡已，常　西士有何新書？何書可譯，足見其醉心西學。共逝世之前年，尙匯刻天學初函二十種，匯刻之宗旨，李子在題辭中，自言之矣；其言曰：「時則有利瑪　者，九萬里抱道來賓，重演斯義，迄今父五十年，多賢似續，翻譯漸廣；顯自法象名理，微及性命根宗，義暢旨玄，得未曾有：顧其書散四方，願學者，每以不盡覩為憾。茲幾諸舊刻，臚作理器二編，編各十種，以公同志，略見九鼎一　……又近歲西來七千卷，方在候旨，將來問奇探頤，尙有待云。（崇禎二年一六二九）</p>
<p>論開局譯書之事，李子在景敎碑書　，亦曰：「七千部奧義宏辭，梯航嗣集，開局演譯，良足以增　冊府，軼古昭來，其如道不虛行，故迄今尙有所待。」</p>
<p>觀此，譯書之舉，似有大規模之組織，將請朝廷，設局逢譯，故曰：「西來七千部，方在候旨……」曰：「開局演譯……」但此偉大計劃，似未曾實行；不過奉敎官紳與西士共相編譯而已；然譯成之書，在明末已有百餘種：王徴序奇器圖說曰：「奇器圖說乃述西諸儒携來彼國圖書，此具七千餘部中之一支，此特其千百之什一耳。」（天啟七年一六二七）</p>
<p>又李九功序勵修一鑑云：「聖化朔洽，西儒接踵來賓，其遠携緗帙七千餘部，譯者百有餘種，而敎中闡理記事諸畫，已具大凡。」（崇禎己卯一六三九年）</p>
<p>又佟國器福州重建聖堂碑記云：「　明萬曆辛丑，泰西利氏梯航九萬里，朝實萬國輿圖，及西書七年餘部；同會諸子在京繙譯白有餘種，明正敎，繼絕學，給紳先生咸稱道之。」</p>
<p>此七千部西書，當時奉敎學者咸樂道之，即敎外及仇敎者亦嘗談述之，則其影響之大可知矣。</p>
<p>霞漳黃貞闢天主敎書云：「今日天主敎書名目多端，艾氏（儒略）說有七千餘部入中國，現在漳州者百餘部。……」（破邪集卷三）</p>
<p>又許大受聖朝佐闢云：「彼夷更宣言西國天書有七千部，即書目已有充楝之多，特未到此耳。……」（破邪集卷五）</p>
<p>金公帶歸之七千部書，及其譯本百餘種，旣如上述，但此七千部今得保存者，僅在北平西什庫北堂圖書館，數百本而已，背面印有耶穌會之會徽，及敎皇保祿五世之宗座微章；其餘書籍，或遺失殆盡，或埋沒無聞，或無從可考。鳴呼！滄海桑田，不禁無限感慨。茲述梗概，以誌前賢熱心文化事葉云爾。</p>

<h3>暑天呢絨淡銷</h3>
<p>時屆伏暑、呢絨銷路自缺、因華服多穿絲綢紗羅、西服今因價貴、亦多改製布質、一般門市舖子、莫不門可羅雀、棋盤街上及長樂樂園諸茶會等市塲、逐日集市者亦漸减少、蓋受當局抑平物價以來、囤戶生意、早已停止、躉批賣買、驟見缺乏云、</p>

<h3>生活與求生</h3>
<p>— 炎炎</p>
<p>坐在黃包車上，披襟當風，似乎並不覺得酷熱；但在前面拉着車，赤腿飛奔的黃包車夫，就汗流浹背了。有八以為這是不人道的，發出「為什麼我坐車而他拉車呢」的口號。我並不這樣想，我想的是另一問題，就是生活是苦痛的。</p>
<p>黃包車以拉車夫為職業，他應該拉，拉也就是他的生活。我們雖然在坐在黃包車上的時候，好像比他有着一個距離，但在我們的職業上，我們的痛苦也正如在赤日底下奔跑，或者有過之無不及。</p>
<p>做汽車夫總比黃包車夫舒服多了，主人化錢買了汽車，租了車間，僱了車夫，在享受上不是同樣的，不過主人坐在後面車夫坐在前面而已。但汽車夫也有他的痛苦。譬如主人通宵遊玩，汽車夫祇能蜷縮在車廂中打瞌睡；開車出了毛病，總是汽車夫頂罪名。</p>
<p>總之，生活是苦痛的！不必羨慕他人，祗要有求生的勇氣。</p>
<h3>曝衣</h3>
<p>— 匡成</p>
<p>晒台上好似在開服裝展覽會，滿眼是皮袍子，大衣，絨綫衫，氈毯……家家戶戶都在忙着翻箱籠，理衣服，一件一件的陳列出來。這幾日，天氣晴朗，靴得有這麽好的太陽，誰都要乘此機會曝晒衣服。</p>
<p>黃老太家，一連忙了五天，才將三箱衣服晒好，而黃老先生叉要來晒他最珍愛的古書和字書了。</p>
<p>天井已經改成了客堂，晒台上叉都是衣服，祗得將一大堆書畫搬在弄堂裏，靠在墻脚下晒着。</p>
<p>一羣皮的孩子，以為又有什麼玩意兒，一齊聚在旁邊觀看，如果沒人看見，就來動手翻書弄畫，這下子又使黃老太多一番麻煩，他祇有端了一張凳子，坐在門口，看見孩子們近攏來，她的嘴就癟呀癟的，駡將起來：</p>
<p>「小鬼，不許亂動！」</p>
<p>內中有不怕事的孩子，看她這樣生氣，反覺得好笑，索興用脚將書踢了一下，並且說道：</p>
<p>「有啥希奇！」</p>
<p>黃老太可更動了火，惡狠狠地駡道：</p>
<p>「不希奇，看你家裏沒東西晒！」</p>
<p>阿毛娘放工回家，看見人家晒書，晒衣服，便想起箱子裏她那件大衣，旗袍，阿毛爺的皮袍子……雖然不多，但也得晒一下子，免得上了霉，到冬天穿不上身。</p>
<p>回家後，阿毛娘將床下的箱子拖了出來，可是開了箱蓋，除了三件單衫外，那裏還有什麽大衣和皮袍子！</p>
<p>「啊！被人偷掉了！」她大吃一驚，可是轉而一想，覺得決不曾有人來偷竊，一定阿毛爺出的花頭。</p>
<p>她忙到床邊，將正在打鼾的阿毛爺用力推了一下，問道：</p>
<p>「箱子裏的衣服那裏去了？」</p>
<p>阿毛爺翻了一個身，慢呑呑地說：「不知道！」</p>
<p>「快說！」阿毛娘喊了幾聲，「不要裝腔！」</p>
<p>「我欠了張瞎子錢，一時逼着要還，祗得將衣服押給他了！」</p>
<p>阿毛娘不禁大怒，「放屁，又是賭錢輸了，你這個人，怎麽這樣沒出息，我們祗有這幾件衣服，到了冬天，拿什麼來穿……」</p>
<p>阿毛娘說罷，便哭了起來。但是弄堂裏黃老太和小孩們吵嘴的聲音又傳了進來：</p>
<p>「看你家沒有東西晒呢！」</p>
<h3>做餠記</h3>
<p>— 星花</p>
<p>第二週戶口米，白米一升，碎米半升之外，並可兼買麵粉一斤半。我家十一人，買得麵粉十六斤半。</p>
<p>麵粉買來，第一天做南瓜麵疙瘩，第二天做靑菜麵餛飩。因為平時不大吃麵食，所以偶而吃幾次，味兒竟異常可口。幾天以後，預備冉做荳沙大餅，換換口味。</p>
<p>我也懷着好奇和興奮的心，加入製造荳沙餅的工作。第一揑乾麵，就要有恒心，時間愈多愈好，務使光滑糯軟。第二，間做圓子一樣，揑成碗形坯子，再把荳沙放進，做成圓體。壓扁，內行與外行就在這最後關頭有分別了。當我慢慢的，使牠扁的當兒，看！那被包圍在裏面的荳沙，從壳薄處，突破而出，於是我不得不打補丁，東一塊，西一塊，成了一個畸形的東西。</p>
<p>烘的工作也是我担任，爐邊溫度相當高，汗不住的滴下，但我不願意把道職務讓給別人。餅烘好了，一盤一盤。凡是奇形怪狀的，我都認得，這是我的「大作」。於是特地叫別人嘗嘗我做的餅，搖頭是給我的回答。我吃自己做的，的確，不說半句謊，牠是多麽好吃呀！</p>
<p>用勞力做成一件件物品，不論給自己或別人享用，是一件快樂的事。——這是　從　次做餅所得的感想。</p>

<h3>「吊兒郎噹」之類</h3>
<p>— 許席珍</p>
<p>俄國作家阿爾志跋綏夫的有名的小設一沙寗」中，我們可以看到不少還一類「吊兒郎噹」的貨色：他們在年齡上是靑年，可是在禁魂上，他們却早巳失去了自信與朝氣。在遍地狼烟的離亂中，他們祇能跳舞，喝酒，賭錢，玩女人，結果，讓目己在這伽驚心怵目的大時代里化成一縷齷齪的烟……而這一類的姿熊，在我們目前的大小城市中的街頭巷尾，當不是頂陌生的了。我們現在是有着頗不少的這一類吊兒郎噹的渣滓隊里的靑年的，他們托蔭在一種特殊僥倖的不須自己辛苦掙取口糧的生活下，蒙着大中學生的外皮或幌子，以三分「小開」，七分「白相人」的姿態出沒在舞塲，劇院，以及靑年女性的周遭，把自己的可貴的年華傾倒在腐臭的垃圾桶里，洋洋自得，扮演了無恥與荒淫的小丑……</p>
<p>曾經有一個時期，我是頗為道些吊兒郎噹之類的靑年表示了惋惜的，可是現在，我甚至不免感到連這點惋惜也是多餘的了。而代替了這惋惜的，却是一種可怕的顫慄：在全部的人類史上，是從來不曾有過一個世界能夠較久地容得下目棄的渣滓的。他們頂多祇能在一個短期的陰霸中一現原形，到這個陰靈過去之後，他們便祇有與惚惚的喑影同其滅亡了。在小說「鋼鐵是怎樣鍊成的」里面，一個由孤兒出身的苦幹家曾對一般吊兒郎噹的靑年們說過這樣的話：「我們用不着他們，我們不要再作請求了，我賭咒，我們決不需要你們這些混蛋。……</p>

<p>Tokyo, 20th (Domei News Agency telegram) Director-General Matsumoto of the Maritime Affairs Bureau, in a speech delivered on the second annual Sea Day, strongly emphasized the importance of maritime transport in the current war and urged increased assistance to sailors. General Matsumoto also called on the nation to pay attention, stating that the work of sailors and shipbuilders, each within their own scope, should intensify their efforts, and their tasks are by no means inferior to the navy. He stated that the concept of modern naval guerrilla warfare aims to hinder commerce, and that future sacrifices are unavoidable. However, he also pointed out that in the current war, the losses of the Japanese merchant fleet have been particularly small, while the losses of the British and American fleets have been very heavy, with Britain losing 18,500,000 tons by the end of June and the United States losing 2,000,000 tons by May 23.</p>

<h3>First Air Raid Alert on the US Atlantic Coast</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 20th (Reuters telegram) According to news from New York last night, the first air raid alert on the US Atlantic coast occurred yesterday midway between New York and New Orleans, in Wilmington and Reidsville in North Carolina. Military authorities in the two cities issued the alert because they received reports of suspicious activity off the coast near Wilmington. A blackout was implemented throughout the coastal area for an hour. The details have not yet been released.</p>
<p>Washington, 19th (Havas Agency telegram) Officials announced today that the Eastern Coast Defense Command reported yesterday that suspicious aircraft were spotted off the coast near Wilmington, South Carolina.

<h3>US Implements Management of Sailing Ships, Establishes American Shipping Company</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 17th (Domei News Agency telegram) According to news from Washington, the US government has decided to establish an American Shipping Company as a supplement to the shortage of ships in American waters. The main business of this new company is to manage the requisition, modification, and operation of sailing ships in the Americas.</p>
<p>Vichy, 20th (Reuters telegram) According to the "Navigation and Commerce News," the US investigation into Asian ships was not satisfactory. Due to the lack of US ships, the supply of white paper to Uruguay is causing panic, and the size of the country's newspapers may be reduced again. The United States is unable to charter ships for transporting iron ore from Brazil and Uruguay. Only one ship transported corn from the Paraíba River to California last week, at a price of $27 per ton. The United States is now organizing land transportation in Central America, and the Mexican government has prepared a large amount of railway materials for Washington.</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Havas Agency telegram) A wireless broadcast from here tonight claimed that in the past 24 hours, our fleet has sunk six enemy merchant ships in the Gulf of Mexico and the territorial waters near British possessions along the South American coast.</p>
<h3>France Modifies Service Law</h3>
<p>Vichy, 20th (Reuters telegram) The French forced labor service law has been slightly modified, with the aim of excluding Jews from the law. The first clause of the law has now been amended to read, "All non-Jewish French male youths are required to perform labor service upon reaching the age of twenty." The recent extension of the French compulsory labor service has increased from eight months to ten months.</p>
<h3>Czech Fraud Case</h3>
<p>Prague, 20th (Reuters telegram) Before the fall of Czechoslovakia, a Jew named Saslavsky collected used stamps, chemically washed off the postmarks, and changed the colors of the stamps. He sold them to stamp collectors at home and abroad as "printing error" stamps, making a profit of 28,000,000 crowns. The Jew has fled, and several accomplices have been arrested.</p>
<h3>Battle Underway in the Eastern Section of Al Alamein; Germans Concentrating Attacks on Ruweisat, British Consolidating Positions in the Center</h3>
<p>Cairo, 20th (Havas Agency telegram) The British Middle East Command announced this morning that there had been no changes in the British front lines in Egypt yesterday. Since the 4th of this month, the number of Axis prisoners has reached 4,000.</p>
<p>Rome, 20th (Reuters telegram) An Italian military headquarters communiqué stated that attacks by British tank formations on the northern and central routes in Egypt had been repelled.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Egyptian Border, 19th (Havas Agency telegram) According to news from Cairo, there were only minor engagements on the front lines in the past 24 hours. Most of the fighting is taking place in the Ruweisat area, which controls the eastern section of Al Alamein. It appears that German Commander Rommel is concentrating all his forces to attack this fortress, but the British are defending it staunchly, making it difficult to take lightly. The Axis forces launched an attack on El Alassa on the northern route yesterday, but were repelled by British tanks and artillery. On the central front, the British attempted to consolidate their positions and straighten their lines. Newspaper reports indicate that Australian forces occupied an important position five miles south of El Alassa the day before yesterday, El Mreir, and intended to continue their advance, but were forced to retreat after fierce resistance from the Axis forces. This British offensive appears to be part of their military strategy to establish a protective line for the Nile Delta. On the German side, there also appears to be an attempt to consolidate their positions, so they have been deploying defenses along the entire front for several days. However, the British hold on El Alassa and Ruweisat prevents the Germans from comfortably deploying a strong defensive line. It is widely believed that the Germans will launch an attack soon. Currently, artillery battles on the front lines are fierce, and troop movements are frequent. Low pressure and sandstorms are not enough to stop their activities. Although the air force is hindered by wind and sand and cannot mobilize extensively, German aircraft are still bombing British transport routes, and British aircraft are also bombing Tobruk and Mersa Matruh. According to British sources, a ship in Tobruk harbor was hit and sunk, and several fires broke out in Mersa Matruh harbor.</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Havas Agency telegram) Military sources: In the past week, fierce battles have continued on the Al Alamein front in Egypt. The British lines, stretching approximately forty miles from a certain point in the east to the Qattara Depression, are now in critical condition. According to Egyptian newspapers, Egypt's fate depends on the current campaign, so the British have taken various steps to suppress anti-British activities. When the Axis forces arrived at the Al Alamein front, they found a large number of enemy troops gathered, and all the fortifications had been built several months ago. The British troops stationed there were troops from India, Australia, South Africa, and other places. On the night of the 14th of this month, the enemy launched an attack with infantry and tank formations, attempting to break through our central line of defense, but they were repelled by the German and Italian allied forces, with 1,200 British soldiers captured and several tanks destroyed. On July 16, our army launched a counterattack, and the British army retreated eastward again. British forces north of Al Alamein launched an attack on our forces that morning. The enemy first bombarded with artillery, and then attacked our lines with tanks and mechanized units along the coastal road, but they were also repelled by the German army, with eight tanks destroyed. On July 17, South African British forces launched another attack on our forces, but were again repelled, with many tanks destroyed and 500 South African soldiers captured.</p>
<h3>German and British Aircraft Launch Air Raids Against Each Other</h3>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Reuters telegram) Authoritative sources here claim that German bombers attacked a major factory in Chelmsford, Essex, England, yesterday. The crew observed that the factory was hit directly by several bombs. German aircraft also attacked ships in the seas around Britain.</p>
<p>London, 20th (Havas Agency telegram) Two German aircraft attacked barrage balloons over Dover today, and several balloons caught fire and burned.</p>
<p>London, 20th (Havas Agency telegram) The Air Ministry announced this morning that there was no German aircraft activity over Britain last night.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Reuters telegram) German officials revealed that groups of British bombers flew over the coastal areas of northwestern Germany last night, and three were shot down.</p>
<p>London, 19th (Havas Agency telegram) The Air Ministry issued a communiqué tonight stating that this afternoon, our aircraft attacked targets in the cities of Lille and Béthune in northwestern France. Afterwards, two bombers and one fighter plane failed to return to base. In addition, our fighter squadrons also launched offensives along the French coast, with unknown results.</p>
<h3>Typhoid Epidemic in Chile</h3>
<p>Santiago, 20th (Reuters telegram) According to the Chilean government, Chile is threatened by meningitis and typhoid fever, and has authorized health authorities to prevent these infectious diseases. All hospitals are controlled by the authority, which can also close schools, barracks, and hotels.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt is Drafting a Plan to Unify Command of the Army and Navy; Leahy to Hold a Key Position in the New Agency, But His Authority Will Not Exceed That of the Deputy Commander-in-Chief</h3>
<p>Washington, 19th (Havas Agency telegram) According to the Washington Post, President Roosevelt and his advisors are drafting a plan to unify the command of the Army and Navy. Former US Ambassador to France, Admiral Leahy, is rumored to hold a key position in this new agency. Admiral Leahy is not only a capable diplomat, but also an outstanding naval talent. Before serving as ambassador to France, he served as Chief of Naval Operations. It is said that he will be ordered to coordinate the activities of the US Army, Navy, and Air Force in various theaters of war around the world, roughly as the President's "Military Assistant." According to the US Constitution, the President is the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and Leahy will assist him in the future. However, Leahy's future authority will not exceed that of the Deputy Commander-in-Chief. His task will be limited to maintaining liaison between the President and the Supreme Command.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 20th (Reuters telegram) According to news from Washington, President Roosevelt has drafted a plan to establish a Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, and it is likely that former Ambassador to France, Admiral Leahy, will hold this position, reporting directly to the President.</p>
<h3>US Senator Tydings Delivers Broadcast Speech</h3>
<p>Baltimore, 19th (Havas Agency telegram) US Democratic Senator Tydings delivered a broadcast speech today stating that British and American generals both support opening a second front in Europe. However, if such a large-scale war is launched without adequate support, it would be a grave mistake, and those responsible should bear the blame. According to the highest military authorities, if the second front cannot be sustained, Britain and the United States will once again face the humiliation of the "Dunkirk evacuation." If so, the situation of the Allied countries will be worse than it is now. It will take time to rest and replenish troops and replenish military equipment. On the other hand, Germany will be able to do what it wants even more than before. However, I am not saying that this risky action is not worth considering, but it must be done with considerable confidence.</p>
<h3>Indian Congress Party Committee to Move to Bombay</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 20th (Reuters telegram) According to sources here, the central organization of the Indian Congress Party is scheduled to move from Allahabad to Bombay on August 2. The Congress Party Committee is scheduled to meet there on August 7.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency telegram) The All-India National Congress Executive Committee recently passed a resolution demanding the withdrawal of British forces from India. The British government is using all means to create an atmosphere of opposition. According to a New Delhi dispatch, the new Indian Defense Minister, Khan, stated on the 19th that the British opposed the Congress Party launching a non-cooperation movement, saying, "Gandhi's request for British labor to withdraw from the movement is clearly intended to establish the right of Hinduism to dominate India. The non-cooperation movement he advocates is a form of intimidation against Britain." It is acknowledged that the Congress Party has contributed greatly to the political awakening of India, and the passage of this resolution is truly incomprehensible. Indian workers, Muslims, communists, and political groups such as the Indian Congress, the Free League, etc., are unlikely to support the resolution.</p>
<h3>Britain Expresses Apology to Sweden</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 19th (Domei News Agency telegram) The Swedish government protested to Britain on July 15 regarding British aircraft flying over its airspace on March 18 and July 10. The British government replied on the 19th, expressing its apology, stating that it was possible that British aircraft ordered to lay mines had flown over Swedish airspace, and guaranteed that similar incidents would not occur again in the future.</p>
<h3>Germany Permits Nude Co-Bathing for Men and Women</h3>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Reuters telegram) According to an order from German Police Chief Himmler, Germany now permits nude co-bathing for men and women, provided that public morals are not offended. Previously, Germany did not allow public nude bathing.</p>
<h3>Private Cars Prohibited in Brazil</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 20th (Reuters telegram) Starting today, Brazil has banned the use of private cars. Trucks and buses are also banned from 10:00 PM to 6:00 AM. According to a spokesman for the Brazilian Oil Committee, trucks will be allowed 15 liters of gasoline per day, and buses 10 liters per day. After this measure is implemented, it will save 330,000 tons of gasoline per year. Last year, Brazil imported 550,000 tons of gasoline.</p>
<h3>US Black Troops Arrive in Northern Ireland</h3>

<h3>English Church Holds Special Prayer for Navy and Merchant Marine</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 20th (Reuters telegram) According to news from London, yesterday, churches throughout England held special prayers for the British Navy and merchant marine. The main ceremony was held at St. Paul's Cathedral in London. British admirals and the Commander of the US Fleet in European waters, Stark, participated in the event. The service was presided over by Archbishop Matthew, who stated that Britain's chances of survival depend on the outcome of the naval battles.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 20th (Reuters telegram) According to news from London, the British House of Commons secretly discussed shipping issues. Members were surprised by the heavy losses of ships. Germany has announced that the Axis powers have sunk 19,000,000 tons of merchant ships. The British government has also admitted that more ships are being sunk than are being built. However, experts believe that new ships built by August next year will be sufficient to compensate for the ships sunk. Britain and the United States have reached an understanding regarding shipbuilding plans, and the construction of merchant ships will be given priority, while the construction of warships will only be secondary, because resolving the transportation problem is of decisive importance to the war situation.</p>
<h3>France and Spain Discuss Implementation of Trade Agreement</h3>
<p>Vichy, 20th (Havas Agency telegram) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today that France and Spain have organized a committee in Madrid to discuss the implementation of the 1940 trade agreement. After several weeks, consultations have been completed, and all issues related to trade between the two countries this year have been resolved.</p>
<h3>British Ship Sunk by Mine Near Portuguese Azores</h3>

<p>Washington, 20th (Havas Agency telegram) Officials announced this morning that two medium-sized US merchant ships have sunk near the eastern coast of the United States and the northern coast of South America. The rescued sailors have landed.</p>
<h3>Guerrillas in Yugoslavia Suffer Losses</h3>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Reuters telegram) German, Hungarian, and Croatian allied forces attacked guerrillas in the Bosnian mountains, killing 11,000 guerrillas in Kladanj.

<p>Berlin, 19th (Havas Agency telegram) According to German military sources, German troops are still continuing their suppression of insurgents in the Bosnian region of the former Yugoslavia. A large number of insurgents have fled into the forests and remote mountains, but the German, Hungarian, and Croatian allied forces are now pursuing them relentlessly, aiming to gradually annihilate them. In one battle, the insurgents lost over a thousand men. Another group of insurgents fled southwest of Sarajevo, attempting to reach the railway line in order to obtain military supplies, but were repelled and suffered over 300 casualties. In addition, another group of insurgents was hiding northwest of Belgrade, repeatedly attacking residents there and even kidnapping women and children. However, after being severely suppressed by government forces, they suffered heavy losses.</p>

<h3>The War Situation on the Southern Front of the Soviet Union: Approaching the Gate to the Caucasus, German Troops in Voronezh Take a Defensive Stance</h3>
<p>German Headquarters, 20th (Haidao News Agency Electricity) - Today's General Military Communiqué states that our troops on the southern route of Eastern Europe, as soon as the heavy rain ceases, will exert their full force to pursue the Soviet troops retreating southeast. Our aircraft routed the enemy east of Rostov, sweeping away vital transportation routes for enemy supplies in the Don River basin. Yesterday, strong enemy forces again attacked the bridgehead fortress of Voronezh, engaging in fierce fighting for a long time but failing to break through. Our aircraft participated in the battle, destroying 36 out of 60 enemy tanks. The railways in the Moscow area are being bombed by German aircraft day and night. The enemy forces south of Lake Ilmen failed in their offensive; an enemy unit was annihilated and 19 tanks destroyed. The port of Murmansk was bombed, with fires breaking out in several shipyards and oil depots. Our aircraft engaged enemy aircraft in Kola Bay, shooting down 17 enemy planes.</p>
<p>Moscow, 20th (Havas News Agency Electricity) - The Soviet Information Bureau announced this morning that fierce fighting is still taking place in the Voronezh area, where German troops have taken a defensive stance. Our troops have retaken several locations.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 19th (Havas News Agency Electricity) - According to an announcement by the Moscow Radio Station, the Red Army General Headquarters has ordered the abandonment of Voroshilovgrad. For the past 24 hours, the Red Army has been confronting the enemy in the Voronezh area and south of Millerovo. As for other areas of the front line, there have been no major developments.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 19th (Alliance News Agency Electricity) - News from Moscow states that hundreds of German tanks are currently targeting Rostov, launching a fierce attack southward. The battle for Rostov, a tank battle between German and Soviet forces, is unprecedented in scope. Since the Soviet army recaptured Rostov from the German army last year, it has made every effort to fortify the city. The Soviet army is now attempting to defend the city to the death, and it is expected that the Soviet army will put up considerable resistance in the city. It is now reported that fresh German troops are arriving continuously in the lower reaches of the Don River, and a portion of them has crossed the Don River and is advancing eastward towards Rostov.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Ukrainian border, 19th (Havas News Agency Electricity) - According to military sources, the Soviet southern front war yesterday approached the gate to the Caucasus. German and Romanian troops, after breaking through the Soviet defenses east of Rostov, continued to advance last night, advancing approximately eight to ten miles in a single day. German forces also used a large number of paratroopers to land behind Red Army lines. Rostov is now within range of German heavy artillery fire, and German aircraft are constantly bombing the city. Transportation in the city is inconvenient, and it is feared that the Red Army will not be able to hold it for long. In addition, the Kalitova River has also been controlled by the German army, and transportation lines to the northeast of the city have been cut off. Even if the Red Army wants to retreat, the only way is to cross the Don River. As for railway transportation, Rostov currently only has a route through Salsk to Stalingrad. German troops have arrived in the suburbs of Kamensk-Shakhtinsky, north of Rostov, and the two armies are engaged in fierce fighting. It is rumored that German motorized units have broken into the city, but this has not yet been confirmed. There is also fierce fighting in the area of ​​Radufsk east of Rostov, where German troops intend to go directly to Novocherkassk. From the current situation, the Red Army's resistance on the Donets River and Don River has weakened in the past five days. The counteroffensive on the line from Stalingrad to Astrakhan has not yet succeeded. In the Astrakhan area, the large tank battle is still ongoing, but it has shifted to the east, which proves that the Red Army is already showing signs of being unable to hold on. According to military observers, after the German army captures Rostov, it will go south to seize the Caucasus. In view of the recent German military deployments in the Kerch Peninsula, this observation is all the more credible. However, according to news from Berlin, the large-scale German offensive has not yet been launched. The current battle situation is still of a preparatory nature, with the aim of occupying strongholds in preparation for a decisive battle. After Rostov and Stalingrad fall, the communication between the Soviet headquarters and the Caucasus will be completely cut off. At that time, the Red Army in central and northern Soviet Union will have difficulty obtaining gasoline supplies. Berlin believes that it will be difficult for the Soviet authorities to transport large amounts of gasoline through the Caspian Sea and Saratov. However, the Soviet army has not been completely defeated. According to the authorities, there is enough gasoline outside the Caucasus to last for two or three months of combat. However, this kind of optimistic view should not be lightly believed.</p>
<p>German Military Department Releases War Situation</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Haidao News Agency Electricity) - According to the German High Command, in the central sector of the Eastern Front, several hundred Soviet troops continued to be captured in the Kiev area, and the mopping-up operation there is about to end. When German aircraft conducted armed reconnaissance in the area, they again attacked Soviet trains southeast of Moscow and destroyed many sections of the railway tracks with heavy bombs. On July 17, the German artillery bombarded the Soviet army during its offensive, first with heavy artillery bombardment, and then infantry, aircraft, and tanks launched a fierce attack. In this battle, 19 Soviet tanks were destroyed or captured. The German Air Force also participated in the battle and was very effective. On Saturday, German dive bombers raided the port of Losista in Kola Bay in the Murmansk region, dropping bombs on the port's ship repair yards and dock facilities, causing several fires. Another German bomber squadron raided the power plant in Momyhi, shooting down four Soviet aircraft.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Haidao News Agency Electricity) - According to the German High Command, German troops advanced towards the lower reaches of the Don River and continued to pursue the defeated Soviet troops in the Voroshilovgrad area. German aircraft assisted in the battle and were also very effective. The railway southeast of Rostov was also heavily bombed, and three trains transporting troops and war materials were destroyed. Ten other trains were also hit, and a station and a fuel depot were also bombed. German aircraft attacked airfields in and around Rostov, destroying four enemy aircraft. The German-Hungarian allied forces advanced towards the Don River. The Soviet counterattack has been defeated, and 121 tanks have been destroyed, with another 14 captured by the German-Hungarian allied forces. Soviet infantry and tank units in the Voronezh area have repeatedly attacked but have also been repulsed. German aircraft in the area have achieved considerable results, with 14 freight cars destroyed inside the station.</p>
<p>Red Army Breaks Through Encirclement Line</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 20th (Havas News Agency Electricity) - For the past 24 hours, the German offensive against Rostov and Stalingrad has not diminished in intensity. According to the Red Star newspaper, the German army has also seized a stronghold in the Millerovo area, enough to threaten the entire front line of the southern Red Army. At present, the battle situation between the Donets River and the Don River is like a race, that is, the large Red Army corps is retreating towards Stalingrad, and the German army is trying to cut off its path. According to Moscow's announcement, the Red Army's retreat is orderly, and the large corps has escaped the encirclement. Berlin also admitted yesterday that the southern Red Army's defense line is quite elastic, implying that the encirclement operation has not been completed and that last year's annihilation battle has not been repeated today. This is something that the German authorities did not expect. However, the German authorities still intend to find ways to attack it, so that it has no opportunity to reorganize and is unable to effectively resist the next German offensive. As for whether the Red Army still intends to defend Rostov or intends to concentrate its forces to hold the new defense line on the Don River and the Caucasus, in other words, the new defense line on the Don River and the Krasnodar-Stalingrad railway, there are still no detailed reports to support this. This line is currently the only transportation line between the central and southern Soviet Union, and it should be defended at all costs. According to news from Moscow, a large number of fresh troops from the Caucasus and Volga regions, commanded by General Lev Lvovich, have arrived at the front line, preparing to assist General Timoshenko's troops in fighting a decisive battle with the German army. The defense of this railway is greatly aided by the effective resistance in the Voronezh area. The continuous counterattacks by the Red Army in the area have contained five or six German armored divisions and five or six infantry divisions.</p>
<p>Moscow, 20th (Havas News Agency Electricity) - The Red Army's official newspaper, Red Daily, recently published an editorial frankly admitting that the Red Army is currently in a critical situation. A warning issued by a reporter stationed in Moscow stated that the German army is still determined to give the Red Army a fatal blow, and this blow will be launched on the southern route. Can it be prevented in time? Can the situation still be reversed to put the German army at a disadvantage? All Soviet newspapers today cautiously answered this question with "yes." In addition, the Truth newspaper published an article today urging the Red Army artillery to do its best to stop the enemy's backbone armored divisions, stating that the Red Army's artillery fire is very fierce, but because it is too scattered, a part of the artillery can not be moved nimbly, and can not be bombed quickly. A large number of German troops are able to concentrate in several places to break through our army's defense lines.</p>
<h3>The Seven Thousand Western Books Brought by Nicholas Trigault at the End of the Ming Dynasty</h3>
<p>— Xu Zongze</p>
<p>During the transition from the Ming to the Qing Dynasty, Jesuit priests came to our country. In addition to spreading religion, they introduced Western science, which brought a unique splendor to the academic world of our country. Mr. Liang Qichao said: "The Ming Dynasty used the Eight-legged Essay to select scholars. The general scholars, except for the Complete Book of Human Nature and Principles personally designated by Emperor Yongle, hardly read any books. The academic world itself was as weak as a person with anemia... Matteo Ricci, Michael Ruggieri, Sabatino de Ursis, Niccolò Longobardo, Didace de Pantoja, Johann Schreck, Emmanuel Diaz, Giulio Aleni, and Johann Adam Schall von Bell, etc., entered China one after another from the late Wanli period to the Tianqi and Chongzhen periods. Chinese scholars such as Xu Wending and Li Liang'an interacted with them and had in-depth research on various academic disciplines... Under this new environment, the academic atmosphere naturally changed. Later generations of scholars in the Qing Dynasty were interested in calendar and mathematics and were most fond of talking about practical application of knowledge, probably influenced by Matteo Ricci and Xu Guangqi." (Academic History of China in the Last Three Hundred Years, pages 13, 14) These words are well said.</p>
<p>Although the Western scholars instilled science, their contribution lies in bridging Chinese and Western cultures. However, their in-depth research, that is, the translation of books, should also be mentioned. The translation of books by Western scholars began with Matteo Ricci and Xu Guangqi's translation of Euclid's Elements, and its expanded work began with the priest Nicholas Trigault bringing seven thousand books from Europe.</p>
<p>Nicholas Trigault, P. Nleol. Trigault, whose Chinese name was Si Biao and courtesy name was Du'airen, was born in 1577. He joined the Society of Jesus in 1594. In the autumn of 1610, he arrived in Macau, and the following spring, he arrived in Nanjing. At that time, Niccolò Longobardo, the head of the Jesuit mission in China, believed that as Chinese ecclesiastical affairs gradually developed, it was necessary to send someone to Rome to report to the Superior General of the Society of Jesus on the missionary affairs in China and to request that missionaries be sent to China. Therefore, he ordered Nicholas Trigault to go. In 1612, Nicholas Trigault set off from Nanjing, arrived in Macau, and in the spring of 1613, he set sail. In the winter of 1614, he arrived in Rome, was received in audience by Pope Paul V, presented the ecclesiastical affairs, and requested permission to translate the classics. He also met the Superior General of the Society of Jesus. After finishing his work, he traveled around Europe, taking the opportunity to pay his respects to the authorities of various Catholic countries, detailing the situation of missionary work in China and promoting Chinese culture. In April 1618, he and 22 fellow members set off from Europe. On July 22, 1620, they finally arrived in Macau, bringing back more than 7,000 Western books given by the Pope, beautifully bound, different from Chinese books. At that time, Chinese scholars who believed in religion, such as Xu Guangqi, Li Zhizao, Yang Tingyun, and Wang Zheng, were all overjoyed and eager to translate them one by one so that European science could be fully introduced into our country. From the prefaces to the translated books, one can get a glimpse of the translation movement at that time.</p>
<p>Earlier, after Xu Guangqi was baptized in 1603, he had many exchanges with Western scholars, listened to their opinions, and thought of translating the books brought by the Western scholars (not the books brought back by Nicholas Trigault) with the help of like-minded people. Xu Guangqi's postscript to Matteo Ricci's Twenty-five Words said: "I occasionally asked for several kinds of books translated by him (Matteo Ricci), received them, and finished studying them. The scriptures he brought from his country filled the boxes, but they had not been translated and could not be read. Since coming to the capital, there have been few writings. These Twenty-five Words were completed in the temporary capital. This summer, Chu Xian, Mr. Feng, asked to give them to Li Zao and pass them on to his people, which is what is called one in ten thousand. However, the general meaning can be seen. I further asked him: In the scriptures you brought, the subtle words and profound meanings are as vast as the sea. If we could get a few like-minded people to translate them together, so that everyone could hear the ultimate arguments and obtain their origins, and also steal their remains to benefit the people, that would be a great pleasure for all ages." (Wanli Jia Chen, 1604 AD)</p>
<p>Xu Guangqi had this request for translating books, and Matteo Ricci replied: "Translating the meaning of the scriptures is not yet possible. You can wait." The reason is that the Western scholars came to our country originally to promote the Holy Religion. If they were to make translation their main task, people might misunderstand that they came from afar solely to promote the study of physical forms and would not pay attention to the merits of glorifying the Lord, saving souls, and transcending nature. Therefore, they seemed reluctant. Xu Guangqi also understood this meaning clearly, so his preface to Sabatino de Ursis's Western Water Law said: "In the study of things and the investigation of principles, there is also a kind of study of images and numbers. The study of images and numbers, the greater ones are calendars and musical scales. As for other things with shape and quality, things with degrees and numbers, they all rely on it for use, and everything used is extremely ingenious. I once traveled with Mr. Ricci, and he told me... Until I served in the court, Mr. Ricci had already passed away. I occasionally asked Mr. Sabatino about it. He hesitated for a long time. Observing his mind, he seemed not stingy, but he seemed ashamed. I then privately speculated. Not being stingy means that all gentlemen seek nothing more than benefiting the country and protecting the people when they study and discuss the Way. How much more would they regard this foreign land as rubble. Being ashamed means that they are deeply afraid that this method will be widely spread, and future generations will regard it as Lu Ban and Mo Di, which is not their intention to come ten thousand miles to the east, sacrificing their lives and risking dangers to enlighten the world and benefit all." (Wanli Ren Zi, 1612 AD)</p>
<p>Xu Guangqi first proposed the idea of ​​translating books, and after Nicholas Trigault brought back seven thousand books, this idea flourished again. Li Zhizao's preface to Giulio Aleni's Record of Foreign Lands said, "This Mr. Nicholas actually has more than seven thousand books from that country, intending to contribute them to the Lantai Unicorn Chamber to combine the knowledge of the East and the West. The virtue is enlightened, and the stars shine brightly. At that time, there were foreign books from foreign countries coming nine thousand miles by sea. This is to expand the ancient to the present and make it magnificent. The Holy Lord respects culture. Now, it is time to extensively gather all the talents, divide them into groups, and translate them so as to fully express the wonders of the sea and mountains!" (Tianqi Gui Hai, 1623 AD)</p>
<p>Also, Yang Tingyun's preface to Giulio Aleni's General Western Learning said: "The so-called Six Classics and scriptures are approximately more than seven thousand books, which have already been transported by sea and can be translated. How can this be compared to the few books brought back by Cai Yin and Xuanzang from various countries in India?" (Tianqi Gui Hai, 1623 AD)</p>
<p>Yang Tingyun also said in the "Origin of Harmony" in the Continued Compilation of Substitutions: "Alas, the coming of seven thousand books from the West is not accidental. Whether they are different or the same, we must not be ignorant of the bright intelligence we have received from the heart. It also lies in seeking with a calm heart and accepting with an open mind."</p>
<p>Li Zhizao also said in the preface to Universal Explanation: "The Jing Sect came from Zhenli, and the Scripture Hall translated many classics over the years. Later generations falsely modified them and attributed them to the Buddhist scriptures... Our Ming Dynasty greatly opened the great fortune, and the sages inherited each other. The Taoist culture is spread throughout the world. Famous scholars recommend auspicious signs to the upper country. At that time, Matteo Ricci opened up a journey of ninety thousand miles, and Nicholas Trigault carried more than ten thousand books. The universe reveals its spiritual secrets, and the mountains and rivers shine with their elite. He will present the world to the court, promote the Holy Religion, and civilize it. This is unprecedented in history... And this book (Universal Explanation) only discusses the nature of form, which is still its most superficial aspect. Since I returned to the countryside in Guihai (1623), I have been living with the Rev. Fu Fanji by the lake, cultivating both body and spirit, and studying the origin. Every time I bring up a meaning, I am fortunate to have never had it before, and my heart and eyes are opened. Therefore, I forget the years and the efforts, and I vow to help translate it, because I cannot bear to lose it in my time. But the written language is cut off, and the throat becomes thorny, and I have repeatedly put down the pen due to difficulties. Therefore, I first selected the things that have form and translated the five great things named heaven, earth, water, air, and fire. After this book is completed, there will be many people in China who understand the written language and reason, and they will be able to express what they want to say. Therefore, I will take the book of reasoning and logic and translate it later." (Chongzhen first year, 1628)</p>
<p>From the above, it can be known that the books brought by Nicholas Trigault are approximately more than seven thousand copies, but the types of books have not been clearly stated. They must be related to the Holy Religion, theology, astronomy, geography, calendar calculation, and all sciences. These books were initially kept in Macau and later continuously transported to the mainland, especially in Beijing. After 1623, it seems that the selection and translation had already begun. Li Zhizao's preface to Universal Explanation has hinted at it. And Li Zhizao worked hard to translate books until he was old, and he often asked Western scholars what new books they had and what books could be translated, which shows his fascination with Western learning. In the year before his death, he also compiled and published twenty kinds of Heavenly Learning Letters. Li Zhizao himself explained the purpose of compiling and publishing in the preface: "At that time, there was Matteo Ricci, who came from ninety thousand miles to bring the Tao. He re-enacted this meaning. Up to now, fifty years have passed, and many virtuous people have continued his work. The translation has gradually expanded, showing itself from the laws of physics and logic, subtly reaching the roots of nature and life. The meaning is clear and the purpose is profound, and it is unprecedented. However, the books are scattered in all directions, and scholars always regret that they cannot see them all. Now, I have gathered the old engravings and made two compilations of principles and instruments, with ten kinds in each compilation, to share with like-minded people. This is to give a brief glimpse of the importance of knowledge... Also, in recent years, seven thousand volumes have come from the West and are awaiting instructions. In the future, there will be much to explore and study." (Chongzhen second year, 1629)</p>
<p>Speaking of opening a bureau to translate books, Li Zhizao also said in the Jing Sect Stele Inscription: "Seven thousand volumes of profound and magnificent words have been gathered one after another, opening a bureau to translate them, which is enough to increase the books in the book repository, surpassing the ancients and revealing the future. It is like the Tao is not practiced in vain, so it is still awaiting."</p>
<p>From this, it seems that there was a large-scale organization for the translation of books, and it was planned to request the court to set up a bureau for translation. Therefore, it is said: "Seven thousand volumes from the West are awaiting instructions..." "Opening a bureau for translation..." However, this great plan seems not to have been implemented. However, the religious officials and gentry jointly translated with the Western scholars. However, there were already more than a hundred kinds of translated books at the end of the Ming Dynasty. Wang Zheng's preface to Illustration of Strange Machines said: "Illustration of Strange Machines is a description of the books brought by Western scholars. This is one of the seven thousand copies, and this is only one-tenth of one hundredth of them." (Tianqi seventh year, 1627)</p>
<p>Also, Li Jiugong's preface to Admonition to Cultivate One's Self said: "The Holy teachings have spread widely, and Western scholars have come as guests one after another. They have brought more than seven thousand volumes of books from afar, and more than one hundred kinds have been translated. The various paintings that explain the principles and record events in the teachings have already been made in general." (Chongzhen Ji Mao, 1639)</p>
<p>Also, Tong Guoqi's Stele Inscription on the Reconstruction of the Holy Church in Fuzhou said: "In the Ming Dynasty, in the Xin Chou year of Wanli, the Westerner Matteo Ricci traveled ninety thousand miles by sea, presenting a map of the world and more than seven thousand copies of Western books. The disciples of the same association translated more than one hundred kinds in Beijing, clarifying the true teachings, continuing the lost learning, and the gentlemen and scholars all praised it."</p>
<p>These seven thousand Western books were happily talked about by the scholars who believed in religion at that time, and even those outside the religion and those who were hostile to the religion also talked about them, so the great influence of them can be known.</p>
<p>Huang Zhen, a native of Xiazhang, wrote the book Refuting the Catholic Church, saying: "Today, there are many kinds of Catholic books. Aleni said that more than seven thousand copies have entered China, and there are more than one hundred copies in Zhangzhou now..." (Volume 3 of Breaking Evil Collection)</p>
<p>Also, Xu Dasu wrote the book Assisting the Holy Dynasty in Refuting, saying: "Those foreigners even declare that there are seven thousand volumes of Western books, and the book list alone is enough to fill a shelf, but they have not yet arrived here..." (Volume 5 of Breaking Evil Collection)</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Nicholas Trigault brought back seven thousand books and more than one hundred kinds of translations. However, only a few hundred copies of these seven thousand copies are preserved today, only in the library of the North Church in Xishiku, Beijing, with the emblem of the Society of Jesus and the pontifical coat of arms of Pope Paul V printed on the back. The remaining books have either been lost, buried, or cannot be verified. Alas! Times change, and there are infinite feelings. Here is a brief account to commemorate the enthusiastic cultural career of the former sages.</p>

<h3>Landlords Renting Out Houses Do Not Need to Apply for Licenses; The Third Paragraph of the Municipal Council's Amended Rules for Sublease Licenses Only Requires Clear Disclosure of Partially Rented Areas and Rents</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council recently issued Regulation No. 6005, stipulating that landlords (i.e., main landlords) who rent out a portion of their houses to others as residences, provided that they do not open separate doors or pay separate house taxes, do not need to apply for sublease house licenses. Furthermore, from now on, the third paragraph of the sublease house license rules is amended as follows:</p>
<p>"The licensee shall clearly list the exact amount of rent paid to the landlord, along with the amount of the municipal tax license fee and utility bills for the previous month (if the licensee provides lighting for their tenants), and post it in a conspicuous location within the house. If the licensee subleases the entire house, they may charge a profit of up to 20% calculated according to the above-mentioned burdens. If the licensee subleases any part of the house, they may charge the same profit proportionally. The all-inclusive rent for each subleased part of the house should be listed, and the portion allocated for the part used by the licensee themselves should also be listed separately in the list. If any question or dispute arises as to whether the rent allocation between the subleased parts is appropriate, the Council may, on its own initiative or upon written request from any sublease tenant, determine the appropriate rent for each subleased part of the house. Licensees shall not add any tips paid to the landlord or any renovation costs for the house to the rent of the sublease tenants to compensate for them."</p>
<h3>Bankers Association Examines the Business of Banks and Pawnshops</h3>
<p>After the Bankers Association was ordered to crack down on banks and pawnshops that were operating without registration and licenses, the Association required new banks and pawnshops applying to join the Association as members to obtain a business license and strictly reviewed their qualifications to ensure prudence. Regarding the business of member banks and pawnshops, strict examinations will be carried out, and they must operate within the scope of business stipulated by laws and regulations. Banks and pawnshops are prohibited from directly engaging in the sale and purchase of commodities for profit and from providing loans to individuals using commodities as collateral to facilitate funding in order to stabilize finance and avoid fueling speculation.</p>
<h3>Rice Purchase Certificates for Next Month Will Be Issued Soon</h3>
<p>The Third Week Rationing Began Yesterday</p>
<p>Rice stores in the two concessions began selling the third installment of rations yesterday, issuing rice based on the third set of purchase certificates. Each purchase certificate can purchase half a liter of white rice, one liter of broken rice, and one and a half catties of flour, which together cost 7.2 yuan in savings certificates. The validity period of the third set of purchase certificates is from yesterday until the 26th. The price of an additional 1.5 catties of flour this period has been reduced by three corners compared to last week. The rice purchase certificates for August have been issued by the district offices starting yesterday. The dates for obtaining the certificates were noted on the back of the donation tickets when the July rice tickets were obtained, so residents only need to check the dates to know everything.</p>
<h3>Foreign Nationals Registration in the French Concession Has Ended</h3>
<p>The registration of foreign nationals from third countries residing in the French Concession and the Western District ended yesterday (the 20th) afternoon and will not be extended, as all such foreign nationals have been registered. According to French police personnel, those who register must be guaranteed by two people, but the guarantors do not have to be residents of the French Concession. Any foreign nationals from third countries who have not yet registered will not be able to obtain a citizen's card and will lose their future rationed food.</p>
<h3>Application for Student Aid Begins: Register Quickly by Filling Out Forms; Application Deadline Approaching, Please Don't Delay. Readers Enthusiastically Donate Funds.</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the first day for the third session of our newspaper's student aid application, students from various primary and secondary schools came to our office to collect forms from morning till night, an unprecedentedly crowded scene. This clearly shows the vast number of young people out of school and the deep and urgent need for support from enthusiastic individuals from all walks of life. Based on the amount of donations received so far, the number of students who can receive assistance is very small. We urge our readers to have compassion for the hungry and those in need, to make a wish to help others help themselves, and to donate generously. This is what we earnestly hope for.</p>
<p>Collect Forms in Person at Our Office</p>
<p>Students from various schools with financial difficulties who wish to collect forms must come to our office in person. Each person is limited to one form and cannot entrust others to collect it on their behalf, and even more so, cannot send servants to collect it. Otherwise, our office will refuse. Furthermore, our office will consider the situation and advance the deadline for application. We hope you will apply as soon as possible, don't delay.</p>
<p>Readers Donate More Enthusiastically</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Tao generously donated 2,000 yuan, Mr. Wang Shenfu of Zhaotai Cotton Cloth Company donated 1,000 yuan through the Wang Chunde Hall, Li Jinshan donated 50 yuan (for his late mother's 12th anniversary memorial from friends), and the Commercial Press (gleanings) donated 7.5 yuan. The above totals 3,057.5 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates. With the previous balance of 64,800.0034 yuan, the total is 67,857.84 yuan.</p>
<h3>Population Census Completed in Both Concessions and the Chinese Area; Foreign Residents' Baojia System Organization Underway</h3>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that, according to information received this morning (the 20th), the population census statistics for the Baojia system in the Shanghai concessions and the Chinese area will be ready for announcement by the 24th or 25th of this month. Except for the large number of German refugees in the Hongshan District, the figures for other residents are almost completely calculated. The registration of foreign residents by the Baojia organs in the French Concession was completed on July 1st, and the statistics for the total number of residents in the French Concession were compiled by July 15th. The work in the Western District began on July 5th and will be completed today. The organizational work for the foreign residents' Baojia organs is also currently underway. It is noted that Chinese residents have already formed their own Baojia system, and Japanese residents have a "neighborhood system." These organizations are all helpful to the authorities. Therefore, the organization of foreign residents' Baojia will also be beneficial to themselves and the municipality. It is heard that the exact duties of the foreign residents' Baojia have not yet been fully decided. However, according to the opinion of police personnel, foreign residents are unlikely to patrol the streets.</p>
<h3>Seasonal Diseases are Prevalent; Pay Attention to Health Preservation</h3>
<p>Cholera has not yet disappeared in this city, and its spread is quite serious. The authorities in both concessions are actively carrying out prevention and control measures. According to reporter inquiries, 98 patients have been confirmed to have true cholera at the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Yu Qiaqing Road. Cases have also been found in other epidemic hospitals. Although most of the infected areas are in the Chinese area, six cases have also been found in the French Concession, and one case has been found in Hongkou. The Public Concession is still safe for the time being. It is generally expected that the epidemic can be suppressed after citizens receive the second injection of vaccine.</p>
<p>According to a report from the Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, within the week before midnight on July 18, 1942, the number of cases and deaths from infectious diseases were as follows: scarlet fever and diphtheria, 5 cases, 2 deaths; tuberculosis, 79 cases, 50 deaths; cholera, 15 cases, 1 death; typhoid fever, 50 cases, 43 deaths; typhus, 14 cases, 9 deaths; choleraic diarrhea, 19 cases, 2 deaths; other diseases, 576 cases.</p>
<h3>Subsidies for Private Schools from the Shanghai Municipal Council Released Yesterday</h3>
<p>Must Hold a Formal Letter of Authorization from the School Board. The Chinese Education Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession has always allocated subsidies to well-managed private schools within the concession and designated them for purposes such as improving school buildings and enriching equipment. It is now known that the first installment of subsidies for private schools for the 1941 academic year was released yesterday (the 20th). The Chinese Education Department has informed each school receiving subsidies to come and collect them at the designated time. However, they must hold a formal letter of authorization from the school board and the school's official seal, and have paid the house tax for the autumn of this year before they can collect it from the Shanghai Municipal Council's General Accounting Office.</p>
<h3>Swiss Authorities Broker Agreement; British and Japanese Exchange of Nationals; British Nationals in the Far East to Withdraw from Shanghai in Early August Aboard the Kamakura Maru and Tatsuta Maru to East Africa</h3>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that the Japanese Consulate General in this city announced that British nationals will withdraw aboard the Japanese ships Kamakura Maru and Tatsuta Maru in August. Havas News Agency reported from London yesterday that an agreement on the exchange of nationals has been finalized through the mediation of the Swiss authorities. It is expected that a total of 1,800 people will be withdrawn, including nationals of the Allied Powers and the United Kingdom from China, Japan, Manchuria, Vietnam, and the Philippines. They will be transported to Lourenço Marques in Portuguese Africa, where Japanese diplomats and civilians will be exchanged on August 27th and September 7th. It is heard that several Swiss representatives will accompany the withdrawing nationals of the Allied Powers and the United Kingdom on board the Kamakura Maru and Tatsuta Maru, as was done when the Conte Verde and Asama Maru carried American nationals withdrawing from Shanghai and Japan. A Havas dispatch also reports that some of the repatriated nationals will go to India, while the rest will continue their journey by taking two ships from Lourenço Marques to England. One of the ships is said to be the "Nevi," while the name of the other ship has not been disclosed. As for the two Japanese ships, they will load Japanese and Thai nationals withdrawing from England, Australia, India, and Africa at Lourenço Marques. It is also disclosed here that among the 1,800 British nationals to be repatriated, diplomats and missionaries will be the majority, with a small number of civilians. If the number of repatriated people increases, British nationals in other cities will be given priority. At the same time, British Consul Gibson, leading 11 British nationals stationed in Nanjing, will arrive in Shanghai this week from Ningbo to await repatriation to their home country.</p>
<h3>Husband, Wife, and Child Perish in Fire</h3>
<p>The Yongli Flag Store on Old North Dou Street in the French Concession caught fire accidentally at 3:30 AM the day before yesterday, resulting in the neighboring Qianzhuang (money shop) owner Dong Zhiliang and his wife, Dong Qiu, being unable to escape and perishing in the fire. The details have been reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that Dong's son, named Keliang, seven years old, was burned in the fire at the time and died in the hospital yesterday morning at 7:00 AM. The police sent the three bodies, large and small, to the coroner's office. Yesterday, the family claimed the bodies for burial.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai Seeks Funding for Projects</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai issued a notice yesterday stating that after the closing of the 12th Membership Solicitation General Assembly, it was resolved to allocate funds to carry out educational loans, vocational loans, relief work, and subsidies for primary schools. Committee members have been separately assigned to be responsible for handling these matters. The purpose of the above four projects is to universally assist poor fellow countrymen, so that they can have opportunities for schooling, employment, and relief. The educational loan application began on the 15th of this month, and the vocational loan application is scheduled to begin on August 1st. All fellow countrymen who are unable to afford schooling or employment may, with the introduction of two members, come to the association to obtain the regulations and register according to the prescribed form, awaiting review. Relief work will also be carried out sequentially once the council has been convened. However, the funds allocated for this item are limited, while the expenses are huge. It is sincerely feared that it will be difficult to sustain in the future. Therefore, we dare to appeal to enthusiastic fellow countrymen to provide assistance to maintain the permanent nature of the projects. Those who wish to donate to a specific project should state it to the association's accounting office when making the payment. A receipt will be issued separately, and thanks will be announced at any time to demonstrate sincerity. This is hereby announced.</p>

<h3>Ocean-going Ships of German, Italian, Portuguese, and Other Foreign Merchants Restore Chinese Merchant Status; Change Names and Lease to Japanese Merchants for Operations on Various Lines; Shanghai's External Shipping Expected to Show New Vigor</h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the Pacific War, Shanghai's external shipping came to a standstill, and industrial and commercial trade was also affected. This was because some shipping companies, originally Chinese merchants, changed to foreign merchant status after the Shanghai war and were forced to suspend business operations. The authorities, aware that this would be very harmful if it continued for a long time, specially approved the restoration of Chinese merchant status to various foreign merchant shipping companies. The ships under their ownership were renamed and leased to Japanese merchant companies for operation. Some did not restore Chinese merchant status but leased their ships directly, while others sold their ships to the Japanese side. The disposal methods for some ships have not yet been decided. However, generally speaking, Shanghai's external shipping and transportation are expected to show new phenomena in the future. Various concrete plans are being promoted step by step.</p>
<p>Permission to Restore Chinese Merchant Status</p>
<p>Shipping companies that changed from Chinese to foreign merchant status and continued to operate after the Shanghai war include: German merchants Reith &amp; Co., Far Eastern Shipping Company, and Lulin &amp; Co.; Portuguese merchants Chengde, Merrill, Huamei, and other shipping companies; and Italian merchants Yihua and Sino-Italian joint venture Sino-Italian shipping companies. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the shipping businesses of the above companies were virtually suspended, and all their ships were completely out of service. They have now been approved by the authorities to restore Chinese merchant status. The ships will be renamed and leased to the Japanese merchants China Shipping Company and East Asia Steamship Association for operation on the: Shanghai-Ningbo line, Shanghai-Dinghai line, including Wan Shenjiamen, Shanghai-Chongming line (Baozhen) (Nandou Port), Shanghai-Yangzhou Qian, Shanghai-Xinshenggang line, Shanghai-Qinglonggang line, Shanghai-Nantong line (Renjiagang) (Tianshenggang), Shanghai-Hankou line.</p>

<h3>Second Landlord Beats Tenant; Police Order Arrest of Assailant</h3>
<p>Shen Baohua, the second landlord of No. 7 Yanging Lane, Xiamen Road, on the 12th of this month, demanded a rent increase from Chen Caisheng (45 years old, from Changzhou), a tailor renting three rooms in the living room. When the demand was not met, he gathered more than ten hooligans and beat Chen, injuring his left waist. Afterwards, Chen abandoned his home and fled. Only one accomplice, Yu Ruifeng, was captured. The details have been briefly reported. It is now learned that Chen was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment by the police after being injured. Although he has recovered slightly, he is still not out of danger. As for the perpetrator Shen Baohua, the police have been sending detectives to guard his house for days, but he has not been captured. A lot of evidence of violations of the law has been found in his house. He is now being strictly ordered to be arrested.</p>
<h3>Da Ya Engineering Company Produces Automobile Carburetors</h3>
<p>Since the supply of gasoline in Shanghai became unsustainable, many people have converted their cars to burn charcoal. However, there are very few who truly engage in this with both engineering principles and experience. Now there is the Da Ya Engineering Company, which is organized by former Jiaotong University professor Mr. Fang and others. It employs engineers who are members of various engineering societies in China and skilled technicians, specializing in the manufacture of carburetors for automobiles. Each machine is specially designed, operates rationally and sensitively, is easy to handle and economical. It is equipped with both electric and hand-cranked blowers, starting in less than five minutes, which is unmatched by ordinary products. It also uses a chemical gas purifier and an oil filter to clean the gas and mix machine oil into the cylinder, which lubricates the inside of the cylinder, making the action more reliable and saving lubricating oil. Installation takes a short time and is inexpensive. Use is guaranteed after installation, and free service is provided. The company welcomes people from all walks of life to try it out and can contact the office at Jiyu Cheng Building, Jiangxi Road (telephone 13195), or the engineering department at the old site of Xiang Sheng Automobile Station, Foch Road (telephone 31212) for nearby contact.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I am writing to you on behalf of my client, Mr. Xi Shengyuan, owner of Taichang Car Company, who states that he has read a news item in today's "Shen Bao" about various car companies receiving stolen goods. The part that involves my client's company is not in accordance with the facts. Zhang Rongqing is one of the employees of this company, and he is not the store owner. Zhang was entrusted by a friend to pack tires that the friend had purchased elsewhere for transportation. He was implicated by this, which was completely unexpected. This matter has nothing to do with this company. Fearing that inaccurate rumors may harm the reputation of the company, I am specially commissioned by the company to send a letter requesting correction. Accordingly, I am sending this letter on behalf of my client, hoping that you will publish it in the "Letters to the Editor" column of your newspaper to make a correction.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Lawyer Ma Junshuo</p>
<p>Today's Newspaper will be published at 6PM.</p>

<h3>Government Bonds in Latent Period; Trade is Light; Situation is Fluctuating</h3>
<p>The over-the-counter market for government bonds was even quieter yesterday. The strong players were all spectators. The market was uncertain, with more declines than gains on the surface. The situation is still fluctuating, but the longer the fluctuation lasts, the greater the change that will brew in the future. It is generally believed that the powerful players are now gathered in the Chinese stock market and are no longer interested in government bonds. However, this is not the case. I expect that there will be a great rebound in the near future, but it will take some time. Those who are good at reading newspapers should know the general outline. Therefore, it is known that it cannot remain latent for long. Yesterday's market price results showed that only Class A bonds rose by 10 cents, while the rest all fell by a small amount of 20 to 30 cents. The turnover was only more than 500,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Weak, More Declining Than Rising</h3>
<p>The Chinese stock market sentiment is erratic, shifting from stable to weak. Among department stores, only Wing On showed a profit, while Sincere declined. China Underwear saw the most active trading, with prices rebounding slightly after a significant increase last weekend. Shanghai Cotton Textiles held firm, Hanyeping was high. Wing On Textiles remained stable. Cultural and New Pharmaceutical stocks both underperformed. Zhabei Water &amp; Electricity and China General Edison continued to fall. Trading volume was thin. Today, we again record the market prices below:</p>
<p>Stock Name	Highest	Lowest</p>
<p>Wing On Co.	167.50	121.50</p>
<p>Sincere Co.	150.00	140.00</p>

<h3>Gold and Silver Jewelry Prices Unchanged</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the selling price of gold jewelry per tael by major jewelry stores in the city remained unchanged at 2,250 yuan (purchases reduced by 350 yuan). Inter-dealer prices ranged from 1,965 yuan to 1,925 yuan per tael, settling at 1,940 yuan at noon, a decrease of 20 yuan. The market was generally weak, with sparse trading. In the afternoon, the price was 1,978 yuan. The listed price for standard silver jewelry remained at 16 yuan per tael, with inter-dealer prices at 11.56 yuan.</p>
<h3>Call Loan Rate Reaches 1.5%</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the military note market saw inter-dealer trading at 5.545 yuan, with retail bid and ask prices at 5.4 and 5.55 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Money Dealers Association suddenly raised the call loan rate by 40%, reaching 1.5%, reportedly due to the flat discounting of new exchange-issued drafts.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Falls Excessively, Small Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the factory cloth market turned around, with prices gradually rebounding, likely due to the excessive falls of the previous week, warranting a reaction. 16-pound "Globe" coarse cloth opened at 175 yuan in the morning, later rising to 180 yuan with buyers. "Flying Goose" coarse cloth was at 177 yuan. 12-pound "Globe" fine cloth was at 166 yuan. "Dapeng" new singles were at 160 yuan, "Fugui" at 161 yuan, "Fugui" fine twill at 42 yuan, and "Magnolia" bleached cloth at 165 yuan, "Qin Liangyu" at 155 yuan, all rising by 5-6 yuan per piece. "Changshou" silk pongee was at 6.25 yuan, "Volleyball" at 4 yuan, and "Three Rams" gingham at 6.2 yuan, all seeing transactions. "Peach Blossom" ladies' crepe opened at 258.5 yuan, closing at 263 yuan at noon and reaching a high of 264 yuan in the afternoon, closing at 263.5 yuan, also up 6 yuan from last week, indicating a firm monthly trend. No. 1 East cloth first fell and then rose, showing a strong upward trend. 12-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth new singles opened at 175 yuan. Both internal and external buying interest increased, gradually rising to a high of 184 yuan, closing at 182.5 yuan at noon, up 6 yuan from last Saturday. Both the industry and its peers were absorbing supply, leading to a general shortage of mid-to-low-end fine cloths. "Dragon Head" bank singles rose to 162 yuan, "Color Ball" to 168 yuan, "Flying Fish" to 164 yuan, "Five Blessings" fine twill to 165 yuan, and "Baby" fine twill to 160 yuan. "Four Gentlemen" gingham opened only at 6.68 yuan in the morning. Short covering and new longs rushed to accumulate, tightening supply. The price closed at 7.02 yuan at noon, also up about 0.23 yuan.</p>
<h3>Summer Woolen Fabrics Sell Slowly</h3>
<p>With the arrival of midsummer, woolen fabric sales are naturally weak, as Chinese garments mostly use silk gauze and other materials. Western suits are also mostly made of fabric now due to high prices. Most retail shops are experiencing slow business. The daily market gatherings in places like Chessboard Street and Changle Paradise tea houses are also gradually decreasing. Since the authorities have suppressed prices, hoarding has already stopped, and wholesale transactions have suddenly become scarce.</p>
<h3>Stable Grain Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, only a few bean transactions occurred, just a slight addition, presenting a stable market. Chongming sand silkworm beans, 20 bags, were priced at 105 yuan. Tianjin tea beans, 25 bags, were priced at 210 yuan.</p>
<p>Sweet potato dried slices had both good arrivals and sales with little change. Yesterday, Jiangbei sweet potato dried slices, 50 bags, remained priced at 110 yuan, and Shandong sweet potato dried slices in straw bags, 30 bags, were priced at 107 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the bean cake market was quite stable. Although inland consumption was not yet active, people's minds were unusually stable, and prices consistently hovered without much fluctuation. Li Zi brand cake, May new crop, 1,000 pieces, was priced at 67.45 yuan. Qing Zhong brand cake, 300 pieces, was priced at 65.5 yuan. Fei Zi brand cake, April, one cart, was priced at 63 yuan. Shen Ji brand cake, March, Wan Gu Zhan delivery order, 500 pieces, was priced at 62 yuan, and April, 500 pieces, was priced at 63.25 yuan. June, 500 pieces, was priced at 65 yuan. May, Yoshida Zhan delivery order, 500 pieces, was priced at 69 yuan.</p>
<p>Bran sales shifted from sluggish to active, showing a market trending from stable to firm. San Xin small bag bran, May delivery order, 300 bags, was priced from 93 yuan to 95 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Shares Dumped by Scattered Hoarders</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sugar share trading at the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office declined sharply due to dumping by scattered hoarders, falling by as much as six yuan. However, sugar firms were buying at the same time, so transaction volume increased. Coarse sugar shares opened at 305.5 yuan, falling directly to close at 301 yuan, with 3,800 bags traded. Raw sugar shares were bid at a little over five yuan, at 290 yuan, but no transactions occurred.</p>
<h3>Fresh Cabbage Prices Fall</h3>
<p>Fresh Xuzhou cabbage prices softened as buyers from the Beijing-Shanghai region did not procure directly from the production areas, and the amount of goods on the market gradually increased. Yesterday, prices fell by over ten yuan with the Lianbang group, but reaching agreement on volume was still difficult. However, it is possible agreement could be approached.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes Increasingly Declining</h3>
<p>The cigarette market continued its downward trend, with local purchasing power weakening considerably. Sales through various channels were rare, resulting in increasingly quiet trading. Consumer sentiment was weary, and market prices declined sharply. Yesterday's opening prices included "Great Britain" brand at 8,000 yuan, "Old Knife" brand at 5,100 yuan, "Pin Hai" brand at 4,400 yuan, "Wu Hua" brand at 3,200 yuan, and "Fairy" brand at 3,250 yuan, a sharp drop of 100-200 yuan compared to last weekend. Japanese cigarettes were inevitably following suit, with "Gold Gun" brand down to 1,250 yuan, "Golden Mansion" brand at 1,800 yuan, "Red Rose" brand at 900 yuan, "All Green" brand at 1,450 yuan, "20 Sticks All Prosperous" brand at 1,500 yuan, "Compass" brand at 1,100 yuan, domestic "Golden Rat" brand at 1,500 yuan, "Beauty" brand at 2,800 yuan, and "Pyramid" brand at 3,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hardware Market Unremarkable</h3>
<p>Recently, the hardware market has been difficult to assess in terms of prosperity or decline, as sales through various channels are vastly different from the past. Moreover, current hardware products have reached a point of balanced supply and demand, resulting in a rather bleak market sentiment. Industry bids and asks largely follow the public meeting quotations from two weeks ago, and the market for various goods is largely unremarkable. We now record the standard market prices below. Originally, purchases of rivets were numerous due to a shortage of circulating goods, so the "Times" price rose from 700 yuan to as high as 750 yuan per barrel. However, inquiries have been scarce since yesterday and today, and the enthusiasm has dissipated. Consequently, industry prices have returned from 750 yuan to 700 yuan, showing no difference from the public meeting quotation. In addition, cement, steel bars, and other key items have fallen back by 1,000 yuan to match the public meeting quotation, with the former selling for 10,000 yuan per ton and the latter for 7,000 yuan per ton. New angle iron sells for 13,000 yuan per ton, and new foreign coins, foreign squares, and foreign plates all sell for 12,000 yuan per ton. Plain galvanized iron ranges from 30,000 to 32,000 yuan per ton, with "Che Guang Yuan Zheng" brand at 20,000 yuan and "Deputy" brand at 18,000 yuan, all showing little difference from the public meeting quotations.</p>
<h3>Sesame Rivet Sales Sluggish</h3>
<p>Since the factory output of sesame rivets has been low, the local inventory is feeling the pinch. Fortunately, sales through various channels have also stopped, so there is no imbalance between supply and demand. Previously, merchants from the Tianjin, Yantai and Northern routes were the main buyers of this product, followed by local factory users. Door-to-door transactions were also lively. However, these wholesale businesses have disappeared recently, with only sporadic retail transactions at shops. The hoarding trend has also vanished long ago, as hoarders no longer consider hardware to be worth hoarding. Industry sentiment is naturally difficult to boost, and standard sales quotations remain stable. Yesterday, 3-point flower color was priced at 1,400 yuan per box, 4-point flower color at 1,300 yuan, 5-point goods were quoted at 1,200 yuan, and 6-point goods sold for 1,100 yuan per box. The market is difficult to assess in terms of prosperity or decline compared to the past.</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Life and Survival</h3>
<p>— Yan Yan</p>
<p>Sitting in a rickshaw, with my coat open to the wind, I didn't feel the heat at all; but the rickshaw puller in front, running barefoot, was covered in sweat. Some people think this is inhumane, and they shout the slogan "Why am I riding while he's pulling?" I don't think that way. I'm thinking about another problem: that life is suffering.</p>
<p>The rickshaw puller's profession is pulling rickshaws. He should pull, and pulling is his life. Although we seem to be at a distance from him when we sit in the rickshaw, in our professions, our suffering is just like running under the scorching sun, or even worse.</p>
<p>Being a chauffeur is much more comfortable than being a rickshaw puller. The master spends money to buy a car, rent a garage, and hire a chauffeur. The enjoyment is not the same, except that the master sits in the back and the chauffeur sits in the front. But the chauffeur also has his own suffering. For example, if the master is out all night, the chauffeur can only curl up in the car and doze off; if something goes wrong with the car, the chauffeur always takes the blame.</p>
<p>In short, life is suffering! There is no need to envy others, just have the courage to survive.</p>
<h3>Airing Clothes</h3>
<p>— Kuang Cheng</p>
<p>The drying platform is like a clothing exhibition, full of fur coats, overcoats, wool sweaters, felt blankets... Every household is busy rummaging through their trunks and sorting out their clothes, displaying them one by one. These days, the weather is sunny, and everyone wants to take this opportunity to air their clothes.</p>
<p>Granny Huang's family had been busy for five days to dry three trunks of clothes, and now Mr. Huang wants to dry his most treasured ancient books and calligraphy.</p>
<p>The courtyard has already been converted into a living room, and the drying platform is also full of clothes, so he had to move a large pile of books and paintings into the alley, leaning them against the foot of the wall to dry.</p>
<p>A group of mischievous children thought there was something fun to see, and gathered around to watch. If no one was looking, they would start flipping through the books and messing with the paintings, which caused Mr. Huang a lot of trouble. He had no choice but to carry a stool, sit at the door, and when he saw the children approaching, his mouth would twitch and he would start scolding:</p>
<p>"Little devils, don't mess around!"</p>
<p>Some fearless children found it funny that she was so angry, so they kicked a book with their feet and said:</p>
<p>"Nothing special!"</p>
<p>Granny Huang got even more angry and scolded fiercely:</p>
<p>"Nothing special, see if your house has anything to dry!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Mao returned home from work and saw people drying books and clothes. She remembered the overcoat and cheongsam in her trunk, and Grandpa Mao's fur coat... Although there weren't many, she still had to dry them for a while to avoid mildew, so she could wear them in winter.</p>
<p>After returning home, Mrs. Mao dragged the trunk out from under the bed, but when she opened the lid, besides three summer shirts, there were no overcoats or fur coats!</p>
<p>"Ah! Someone stole them!" She was shocked, but then she thought about it and felt that no one had ever come to steal, it must have been Grandpa Mao's doing.</p>
<p>She rushed to the bed and pushed Grandpa Mao, who was snoring, forcefully, and asked:</p>
<p>"Where did the clothes in the trunk go?"</p>
<p>Grandpa Mao turned over and said slowly: "I don't know!"</p>
<p>"Tell me!" Mrs. Mao shouted a few times, "Don't pretend!"</p>
<p>"I owed Zhang the Blind money, and he was pressing me to pay it back, so I had to pawn the clothes to him!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Mao couldn't help but get angry, "Bullshit, you lost gambling again, you have no ambition, we only have these few clothes, what will we wear in winter..."</p>
<p>After Mrs. Mao finished speaking, she cried. But the sound of Granny Huang arguing with the children in the alley came in again:</p>
<p>"See if your house has anything to dry!"</p>
<h3>Making Cakes</h3>
<p>— Xing Hua</p>
<p>The second week's household ration of rice: in addition to one liter of white rice and half a liter of broken rice, you can also buy one and a half catties of flour. My family has eleven people, so we bought sixteen and a half catties of flour.</p>
<p>After buying the flour, we made pumpkin dumplings on the first day and vegetable wontons on the second day. Because we don't usually eat much pasta, eating it a few times occasionally tastes exceptionally delicious. A few days later, we planned to make red bean paste cakes to change the flavor.</p>
<p>I also joined the work of making red bean paste cakes with curiosity and excitement. First, kneading the dry flour requires perseverance. The more time spent, the better, to make it smooth and soft. Second, like making glutinous rice balls, pinch it into a bowl-shaped embryo, then put in the red bean paste and make it into a round body. Pressing it flat is where the expert and the layman differ. When I was slowly flattening it, look! The red bean paste wrapped inside broke through from the thin spot, so I had to patch it up, one piece here, one piece there, turning it into a deformed thing.</p>
<p>I was also responsible for baking. The temperature by the stove was quite high, and sweat dripped constantly, but I didn't want to give up my job to others. The cakes were baked, one plate after another. I recognized all the odd shapes, these were my "masterpieces". So I specially asked others to taste the cakes I made, and the answer I got was a shake of the head. I ate the ones I made myself, and indeed, without telling a lie, they were so delicious!</p>
<p>Making items with labor, whether for yourself or for others to enjoy, is a happy thing. —— This is the reflection I got from making cakes for the first time.</p>
<h3>Life</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yueshan</p>
<p>Life is like tea, the deeper you drink, the sooner you will see the dregs at the bottom of the cup. — Baley</p>
<p>Life is short, and time is constantly flowing, like blood flowing from a fatal wound. — Heraclitus</p>
<p>The length of life is not calculated by the number of years he lives, but by the events he encounters in those years. — Wolff</p>
<p>The wisdom of life is often deeper and broader than the wisdom of people. — Gorky</p>
<h3>The Fun of Living</h3>
<p>— A Meng</p>
<p>The simplest way to test each person's interests is to observe whether they find something interesting on every page of the newspaper: international news, sports, theater, music, books, stock market transactions, etc. If they do, then they must be living a beautiful life. This not only shows the richness and abundance of life, and the constant expansion of curiosity; it is also the best insurance against the inevitable decline and difficulties of life. Even if a person is unhappy, they can still think of the fun of living. Today's world is not as easy as it was ten years ago, but its fun has become even greater and more boundless. "Translated from Reader's Digest"</p>
<h3>"Cavalier" and the like</h3>
<p>— Xu Xizhen</p>
<p>In the famous short novel "Sanin" by Russian writer Artzybashev, we can see many "cavalier" types: they are young in age, but in their souls, they have long lost their confidence and vigor. In the midst of chaos and war, they can only dance, drink, gamble, and play with women, and as a result, they turn into a filthy wisp of smoke in this shocking era… And this kind of posture is not unfamiliar in the streets and alleys of our big and small cities today. We now have quite a few of these cavalier youths in the scum team. They are under the shadow of a special kind of luck, not having to work hard to earn their living, wearing the outer skin or facade of college students, appearing in dance halls, theaters, and around young women with a three-point "young master" and seven-point "playboy" posture, pouring their precious youth into foul-smelling garbage cans, smug and playing the clown of shamelessness and absurdity…</p>
<p>There was a time when I felt quite sorry for these cavalier youths, but now I even feel that this pity is superfluous. What has replaced this pity is a kind of terrible tremor: in the entire history of mankind, there has never been a world that can tolerate self-abandoned scum for long. At most, they can only briefly appear in a short-term darkness. After this dark spirit passes, they can only perish with the vague shadows. In the novel "How the Steel Was Tempered", a hardworking man from an orphanage once said these words to a group of cavalier youths: "We don't need them, we don't want to ask for it anymore, I swear, we definitely don't need you bastards."</p>
<h3>Sharing Weal and Woe</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(7) Swift Thunder</p>
<p>Cui Zhen saw this unusual thing and told Mrs. Ye Er the situation. After hearing the report, Mrs. Ye Er immediately went to Shuangmei Study. Seeing that Wei Cheng looked like he had shed tears, she looked at the desk and saw only thread, old letters, and a few old books. She asked Wei Cheng, "Wei Cheng, is there something wrong?" Wei Cheng forced a smile and said, "I'm fine." Mrs. Ye Er said, "No, Cui Zhen told me that you found a piece of paper in the old books, and you were so startled that your hands were ice-cold and your face changed color. What exactly is going on?" Wei Cheng said, "That's Cui Zhen's overthinking. What I saw was a letter my mother gave me when I was studying in Suzhou. I brought this letter back home from Suzhou, and I felt some emotions when I saw it. Actually, it's nothing." Mrs. Ye Er said, "No, no, your eyelids are still wet, you've been crying. This isn't just emotion." Wei Cheng said, "When I read the letter and looked at the portraits of my father and mother, I thought that when my mother wrote the letter, she was still able to write even though she was sick. Now, my mother is sleeping soundly underground, and she can no longer teach me in letters, so I shed two tears." Mrs. Ye Er said, "I told you a long time ago that people cannot be brought back to life. It's understandable to be sad about your mother's death. But if you keep thinking about it and shedding tears, your mother wouldn't want that either. I always remember your mother saying: Seeing my son eat more, I will eat more too. If your mother were alive, she would definitely be sad to see you sad. Wei Cheng, you've been hiding in Shuangmei Study for the past few days, and you've lost weight. This is not a solution. Visit relatives, don't just keep thinking that you are in mourning, not drinking, not eating meat, not going out. When you were studying at school, didn't they say that modern young people only wear a black纱 on their arms as a sign of mourning for their parents? If you can think that way, you won't just act like a saint at home." Wei Cheng nodded repeatedly and said, "Aunt, I understand." (133)</p>
