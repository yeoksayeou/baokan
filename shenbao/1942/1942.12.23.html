<h3 id="c1">服從公衆秩序 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>去年大東亞戰爭爆發以來，上海開始進入新的時代，由英美的統治進入在日本指導下市民逐漸自治的階段。每一個市民，都有參加公共事業的權利和義務。最明顯的例子，是保甲制度的實施，使每一個市民都有自衛的機會，這在上海的地方歷史上，是値得大書特書的。</p>
<p>很明顯的，社會公衆秩序的維持，並不辦是當局的警　，和保甲自警團的責任，我們一般市民也要分別負起責任來的。因為，上海是四百多萬人口的大都市，警　和自警團的人數當然有限，希望社會的安寗，首先還在一般市民服從公衆秩序，勿作妨礙治安的行動；否則單靠警　和自警團的力量，空間是「事倍功半」了。</p>
<p>可是，過去國人對於服從公衆秩序的習慣，還不能普遍。例如一般人素以法律上大家小能做不許做而自己可以破例去做爲榮耀；同時聽到看到的人，也會對他表示羨慕之意。我們希望改去這種惡習，固然不是一朝一夕所能做，但是，在目前戰時，卻不容許我們再有這種惡習了。</p>
<p>最近本市舉行防空演習，一部份市民還不能充分遵守秩序，他如對於空襲時交通的規則，以及公共租界和法租界交界地點，自警團向市民檢查市民證，常有不願服從自警團，强詞奪理的情形，使公衆秩序的維持工作不能順利進行。</p>
<p>所以我們一方面希望自　團認　自己對地方安寗，對社會秩序所負責任的重大，認眞執行自己的任務。當然，在對待同胞的態度上，須有禮貌。一方面我們最期望的還是一般市民，大家要服從公衆的秩序，不要見了　警，則害怕得連話也說不出，而見了自己同胞所組織的自警團，就倔强無禮，甚　惡意地開玩笑和辱駡。我們要大家自己檢點，自己警惕。我們要在這戰時，共同來盡力維持公衆的秩序。</p>

<h3 id="c2">北非戰的重要性與軸心的反攻　十二月十八日大阪每日社論 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>敵軍的北非登陸作戰，雖經華斯福飾以遁詞，輕舞淡寫地喚做「小規模的第二戰綫」，其實却包含着極大的欲望，是敵人作了相當準備才展開的一大作戰。與北非登陸相呼應的英第八軍自埃及的大規模攻勢，事前一直在進行着的西非及英本土一帶的美兵力的增强，對愧儡達朗的卑劣的拉攏，這些都說明着他們的處心積慮。無論美英如何瘋在，爲了「小規模的第二戰綫」，難道他們肯拋下比骨肉更貴重的八百餘船艦的賭注麼？他們所希望的，恐怕是想由登陸軍和第八軍兩面夾攻，把難美爾將軍從非洲趕出，把地中海制海權奪回美英的手中，然後，從歐洲大陸地中海沿岸的最弱點企圖着登陸吧！故此，這一舉的成收，不僅可以決定一局部戰的勝負，並且可以說是這次大戰中劃時期的一段落。</p>
<p>敵方以極小的損失，博得了開頭一些廉價的成功。摩洛哥方面的大舉登陸，由遠朗叛　造成的阿爾及耳的早期崩潰，蒙特戈姆萊麾下第八軍的班加齊南方進出，就是乘勝而來的英軍，突破了比　和突尼斯的中間一點，甚至表示了有出擊蓋勃斯灣的可能。</p>
<p>但是，我軸心國方面的反攻，也未可小視。德義空軍不久就大舉向突尼斯方面移動；地中海最狹部的所謂突尼斯，西齊利亞，薩爾求尼亞正三角形，由軕心空軍鐵壁一樣的掩護，而被確保：地中海被切成了兩截。敵方二條補給路，一自阿爾及耳到丘尼其亞，一自埃及到班加齊，早被强化了的軸心空軍切斷；敵人剛剛奪回去的阿爾及耳里比亞諸港，受着無間斷的猛炸，已陷於「使用不能」：尙嫌不足的船舶，則相繼化爲地中海的藻屑。因此，陸上作戰就减少了當初的威力，立刻轉成了守勢。到比塞大爲止進展了十幾公里的美英軍，被德義機械部隊包圍起來，達巴爾卡相繼吿失，銳氣墮盡的蒙特戈姆萊完全失去了作用。</p>
<p>形勢逆轉，不但限於戰鬥而已。政治方面，也日益於我方有利。由美國策動而出的達朗，和英國製的偽政權特戈爾，雙方起了正面衝突，由此並波及到美英蘇外交關係的破裂。特戈爾在法國瓦解後，在英國的最困難期，就投入英國懷抱，二年餘來共了許多患難，現在把他加以遺棄，從新又捧出一個赤裸裸再現著反英傾向的達朗來，這在英國難道是可能的麼？假令眞是這樣的話，那麼，以倫敦爲安樂窩的亡命者的政權就要動搖起來。這些亡命客，一向在妄想美英勝利的一天，他們是吃住了英國的，現在看到主人這樣隨隨便便地加以遺棄，一定不會再死心塌地爲英國效命了。反對達朗的蘇聯，再從中一作梗，美英就更加頭痛。因此，連美國恐怕也不會永久擁立達朗的，把他作爲作戰上一時的工具，用了一下，然後棄如敝屣，那是不待言的。</p>
<p>北非的戰局，目前還未脫初戰時期。英勇迎戰的德義軍，每天都在改進着戰綫，到眞正打敗美英爲止，這猛烈的戰爭恐怕通過今冬一直要繼續下去的吧。假使軸心國能確保現在的空軍優勢，繼續給美英船舶以致命打擊，使美英軍吃第二次鄧苟克的敗仗，也許這就成爲決定這次大戰勝負的關鍵之一，也說不定。最近，每日電訊（Daily　Mail）的社論說：「丘尼其亞一戰，美英方面似乎稍形慌亂」。說着這樣沉痛的話，在我們看來，無寗倒是一件快報。</p>

<p>答、國民政府認定復興中華、保衛東亞、爲其　肩上所擔負之同一責任、政治、軍事、財政、經濟方策、均以此爲準繩、自强云者、固在使中國增强其力量、而非僅爲中國增强力量、，尤在增强此力量使再貢獻於東亞之保衛與建設、其可貨諸君扼要言之者、則（一）在政治上、首在把握民心、使全國國民明白認識撲滅抗戰陣營、協力大東亞戰爭之意義與責任、並予以嚴格之組織與訓練、使能擔負此責任、新國民運動之使命、卽在於此、次爲强化政治機構、增進行政効率，務使一人一事皆能發揮最大之功能、中央之決策、地方之施政、渾然一體、依於時局之需要、就其重點一一推進、（二）在軍事上除對渝共軍事方略外、採取精兵主義、建軍與整編並重、建軍在養成新的良好軍隊、整編在就原有軍隊使之化弱爲强、中央陸軍軍官學校及海軍學校之設立、即所以養成優秀、之靑年軍官、使能建立和平反共建國之中堅部隊、以爲興奪中華保衛東亞之　旅、中央　軍將校訓練團及海軍高級幹部講習班之舉行、則就各部隊調集將校、授予政治訓練與軍事訓練、俾能對國家對東亞有堅定之信念、　地方盡保陣治安愛護民衆之職責、（三）在財政經濟上、還都第一年於離亂之餘、　言復興建設、自非易事、故首先勵行極度之緊縮、以確立預決算收支之平衡、並盡最大之努力、維繫僅存之元氣、使民生經濟不再受摧殘、還都第二年、幣制之整理、以爲確立財政、調節金融、促進生產之槓桿、並加緊糧食之管理期民食之所需兩得其平、今將進入第三階段、即幣制之統一與强化、物資之調劑與管理、而以動員人力物力以求生產力之增進爲其目標、凡所以謀國民政府財政經濟力量之强化者、亦即所以應協力完遂戰爭之需要、、</p>

<p>答、在大東亞戰爭期間、貴國有大東亞省之設置、所關於協力完遂戰爭及戰爭完遂後共榮圈之建立者至深且鉅、靑木大臣閣下自還都以來、即就任國民政府最高經濟顧問、對於中國之堪狀及其前途、知之彌深、而助之彌切、以靑木閣下而首任大東亞大臣、國民政府同人期待至股、於此猶有一語欲爲諸君吿者、大東亞省設置之初、外間頗有謂共榮圈內無外交之可言者、斯實無稽之　言、東亞今日首須對內團結、乃能對外禦侮、竊以爲今日以後、東亞同志各國必須盡其心血的外交、以求彼此之互相諒解、互相信賴、互相濟助、使東亞各國家民族之心力、人力物力合　爲、以爲對外發揮强而有力之織血外交之基礎、故今後外交之性格、實較舊秩序時代彼此　心鬥角之　謀術數、更爲　要而更有意義、一言以蔽之、則東亞同志各國、於共榮圈內必須各盡其最誠摯之心血外交、而後對共榮　外、乃能共舉其强力之鐵血外交、明乎此、則大東亞無外交之怪論、不攻而自破矣、</p>

<p>眾議院長議員　津雲國利</p>
<p>眾議秘書長　大木　操</p>
<p>譯自三十一年十二月「現代」</p>
<p>大木：因爲地下的水，非常之少，選煤的設備和勞力，都可省去。掘出的煤，馬上可以裝在運貨汽車上。此外，斷層面也極少。煤層向水平展開着，並不傾斜過甚。由上可知這煤鑛實在具備着極優秀的特徵。它現在正在迅速地開發之中，富麗的職員住宅，也已竣工了。</p>
<p>津雲：一踏進山西省，每一個車站前面，都有直徑二三尺的煤塊滾在地上，有時候把它捆在繩上，使無鞍之馬背負着，煤塊很大，所以不必裝在袋裏，從火車的窗口可以看到數百至數千匹無鞍之馬背負着煤塊，而旁邊有日本兵護送着。石灰石錳等也用繩縛在馬背上，數百匹馬形成長蛇陣搬運着。這眞是壯觀。這一切都是有助於大東亞戰爭的。</p>
<p>大木：大同煤的歷史，據說是世界最古的。在歐洲尙未應用煤炭之前，中國人已經把它當作會燃燒的黑石，用來燒飯了。據說，離今約六百五六十年前，馬可勃羅在大同看到這情景，頗爲驚異，特地把它記於「東方紀遊」之中。</p>
<p>記者：此外蒙疆還有什麼重要資源呢？</p>
<p>津雲：還有日本及滿洲所無的石棉和雲母。</p>
<p>記者：你們有沒有去瞻謁北白川宮永久王殿下的遺跡嗎？</p>
<p>津雲：瞻謁了北白川宮永久王殿下的遺跡，拜見殿下的樸素的陣中生活之模樣，聽到管理者種種說明，我們一行不禁淚下。經過淸水河的陣亡兵士紀念塔的人們，日本人不必說了，就是華人，滿人及蒙古人，也都誠心地對之敬禮，這是我親眼看到的，殿下遺德的廣大無涯，使我極爲感動。</p>
<p>大木：我也和議長同行，訪問殿下曾居住的紀念館，並曾瞻謁安置殿下之靈位的蒙疆神社，從梅田司祭聽到殿下的陣中生活和陣亡的模樣，感動得不禁淚下。聞悉殿下爲日蒙親善所盡的努力，想起蒙古發展的前途，眞是感激萬分。</p>
<p>記者：眞是値得感激的事。在這裏請你們對華北及蒙疆的將來的重要性發揮一下。</p>
<p>津雲：自從大東亞戰爭以來，華北及蒙疆作爲後方兵站的重要性，更形增加了。例如：在南方適於製鹽的地方很少，而在華北如剛才所說製鹽是有極燦爛之前途的。因此，南方的鹽，將山華北供給，把南方的資源和華北的資源配合起來，戰爭資材及其他生活資材，才有大量生產的可能。試舉一事為例，倘使南方的鐵非鐵多屬，經金鐵等原鐵，被大量輸入，那麼華北的煤就變成絕對需要了。</p>
<p>將這些事實綜合地考慮起來，藉大東亞戰爭獲得南方資源之後，華北作爲後方兵站的重要性，自將益形增加。</p>

<p>德元首行營二十二日海通社電　今午德軍戰報稱、蘇軍企圖在伏爾加河對岸獲得根據地未退、頓河流域中區激戰未已、德軍數師昨奮勇抵抗進犯之蘇軍、敵損失慘重、最近十日中、某一區內蘇聯坦克車損毀四〇四輛、蘇齊尼希區內、德·匈聯軍敢死隊摧毀蘇軍堡壘多處、獲得戰勝品而返、進犯之敵軍勁旅已被擊退、托洛貝資區內之蘇軍、數廣進攻德軍陣地、獲得進展、班加齊遭遇夜襲、港務設施被炸彈擊中、敵魚雷艇一艘、中彈受創、</p>
<p>柏林二十二日海通社電　柏林消息靈通人士透露、除斯達林格勒西南區外、頓河流域東部戰事最爲激烈、最近蘇軍之大舉進攻、在德軍將領意料之中、即將採取反攻之適當措施、　何時、何地及如何進行反攻之消息、則目前不能透露、空軍相交、德機仍佔上風、德空軍質量咸較敵爲優、斯城西南部之戰事、德羅駐軍仍居主動地位、斯城戰事情况、無重要變動、</p>
<p>柏林二十二哈瓦斯社電　官方頃宣布東綫戰局如下（一）中路方面紅軍繼續進行攻勢戰、該區紅軍係由斯達林及伏羅希洛夫上將親自指揮、紅軍犧牲雖衆、仍不斷以大批摩托化部隊增援、但紅軍迄未獲得決定性的勝利、</p>
<p>柏林二十二日中央社電　此次蘇軍在頓河中流一帶發動攻勢、曾突破軸心軍一部份防衛陣地、德義聯軍爲避免無謂損失起見、即暫轉移至後方新陣地、茲據德軍當局於二十一日下午聲明稱、頓河戰綫現仍繼續激戰中、蘇軍雖曾不顧重大損失猛烈進攻、但其攻擊力已削弱、經德義軍數度反攻、其兵員裝備消耗甚大、德軍當局在該聲明中、使用「消耗甚大」、四字、因係尙屬初次、故蘇軍所受損失之重大不難於此想見、蘇軍在頓河、伏爾加河中部、雖發動大規模反攻、終於喪失戰車七十輛後完全敗退、現德軍仍固守各原有陣地、</p>

<p>上海食油同業批發處、自繼續向軍配當局購就食油五千担運滬後、原擬配給各食油零售店、規定憑房捐及戶籍證發售、旋因發現有僞造房捐票弊端、遂臨時改變辦法、將全市一千八百卅家食油店合併、分爲甲乙兩組、於昨（廿一）日起十五日爲止、乙組由二十六日起售至二十九日爲止、門售價格每一市斤爲七元一角、半市斤爲三元五角半、甲組商店售油每人最多爲一斤、乙組商店售油每人最多半斤、昨（廿二）日各大食油市民均排號購油、情形異常擁擠、未至二小時、即行售完、</p>
<p>對軋油應斷然處置</p>
<p>據大通社記者赴各另售油店視察、昨日各另售店均將售油時間延長、自上午九時起至下午五時止、故軋油隊仍可映入眼簾、昨日出售油店、係屬甲組、每人可購豆油一斤、憑編定號次購買、並無其他手續、昨日出售之甲組油店、僅一部分、今日出售之第二組、仍爲八十家、由批發處排定發表、以便往購、　　各業需油直接配給</p>

<p>油料運滬分配辦法</p>
<p>軍配黨局為疏通食油來源、向大連青島天津等產油區域訂購食油運滬接濟、並收購滬市各榨油廠所榨之油、此外、並計劃增加各油廠生產量、自與華北關係方面訂有華北華中物資交換協定後、依此協定、華北將有大豆芝蔴等六千噸運滬、所以本市榨油業可望好轉、聞此項大豆芝蔴分配辦法、（一）日商方面八家油廠可得全額百分之七五、（二）華商方面四家油廠可得全額百分之二五、預料明春起、中日各榨油廠之開工率可達四成、嗣後如原料獲得接濟、其開工率再可增加、並能救濟滬市食油缺乏之恐慌、如各油廠完全恢復開工製油、則其生產之油量、足可應用、</p>

<h3 id="c38">標本願望 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— 元咎</p>
<p>關於食糧問題之嚴重性，有增無已！本報讀者亟切呼籲於前，有關當局發　談話於後。其在政治，經濟上之影響，已　發無遺。今以市民立塲，謹作芻　之獻如後：</p>
<p>治標辦法　由市商會召集各同業公會籌款，及與銀行界商借臨時借款，—尤其中央儲備銀行，儘量幫助，俾物價政策，與通貨政策，打成一片。—與保甲委員會合作，呈准當局，向四郊採米，實行公糶，以補戶口米之不足。</p>
<p>治本辦法　兩租界當局，與和平區行政當局洽商，暢通米糧來源，增加戶口米配給量。同時，改善其米質。以足敷食用爲止。</p>
<p>附帶辦法　禁止並搜查米店及住戶有囤積行爲，並限定米販市價，俾不致居奇，而影響平民生活。</p>
<p>以上三種辦法，希望能立時逐步實現！因循一天，即人民多受一天痛苦！上海的地方經濟，多增一些不安現象！同時，因上海食糧恐慌，刺激物價上漲，也影響到和平區的物價。所以，上海食糧問題得到圓滿的解決，和平區的物價統制政策，也能得釗莫大的幫助。這不是簡單的上海地方問題，或和平區連帶的問題，更是大東亞共榮圈的基礎問題！</p>
<p>米價陡漲之真因　逸民</p>
<p>（一）奸商在上海近郊囤米　近二月間，奸商因見上海近郊米價，每擔約二百四十元，紛紛向銀行提款，在崑山蘇州南翔大塲浦東江灣吳淞等　，囤積大量米穀，將來靑黃不接之時，運來上海，以圖厚利，因此市上之米頓减，價乃大漲。</p>
<p>（二）米販散播謠言　謠言一出，米價遂即提高，尤其是上海人，見米價一高，恐慌亦巨，愈買愈高，愈高愈買，此乃米販作祟，欲杜絕奸商與米販之作祟，惟一辦法，即工部局戶口米增加數量，及嚴厲取締近郊囤米，如果可能，對米販售價，加以抑制。</p>
<p>全面解決的注意點　仁林</p>
<p>糧食問題的解決，不宜各地爲政，而須有統一的辦法，謹提出幾個根本的注意點以供當局的參考，並備國人的研究：</p>
<p>（一）糧食應採嚴格的有計劃的統制，絕對禁止過去的自由買賣和任意操縱的狀態，以杜絕奸商搗亂之弊。</p>
<p>（二）糧貧統制的區域，宜擴及於整個的和平區。</p>
<p>（三）米價爲華中一般物價漲落的中心，絕對不能將米價指數與其他物價指數，作同等的看法。所以劃一米價的訂定，須十分的審慎。</p>
<p>（四）米價的決定，須顧及生產者和消費者雙方的利益。否則仍將有害而無利，難免再蹈過去的覆轍。米價須包括農民的生產成本，和合理的利潤，以訂定一整個和平區的劃一之標準，然後再參照各地的情形，和加上必要的運銷費用，依此標準，酌爲增减，而爲各該地的當然價格。</p>
<p>（五）糧食的運銷，須有整個的計劃和合理的分配，使各地能收互通有無調劑盈虛之效。</p>
<p>（六）加緊各地農村的生產與鄰近都市的消費之聯絡，糧食的需要以取給於當地的爲原則。有盈則供他地的不足，不足則取給於他地的有餘。</p>
<p>（七）至於糧食的採購機構，也須加以澈底的改革。在治安業已確立的淸鄕區域內，可由政府機關直接採購，以免商人的剝削。在尙未淸鄕的區域，直接採購較爲困難，則仍可由米商等代辦，但是政府不得爲少數的代辦者維持利益，更不可爲少數的地主之利益打算，而結怨於民眾。總之，糧食的採購，須本為公約精神，以維持一般人民的利益，藉以安定民生，鞏固治安</p>
<p>（八）至於銷售的機構，也須加以改革。在淸鄕區內，戶口調查，業已完成，亦可採取計口授糧制。至於未淸鄕的區域，則可採公賣的辦法，迨至將來淸鄉完成後，再改採計口採糧制。</p>
<p>（九）對於授糧的數量、須加以合理的詳細的規定，以滿足各個人的需要。</p>
<p>（十）對於製酒　糕餅等不必要之消費，須加以限制和禁止。</p>

<h3 id="c50">何必發訃聞 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— 客觀</p>
<p>在一個買賣廢紙者的籮裏，看見幾冊訃聞，都是厚厚的一本，潔白連史紙，藍面，綫裝，印刷以至一切，都很精緻優美。</p>
<p>封面上有某名人的題字。第一頁是死者的銅版照片，照片上有某要人的題額，照片下有某詩人題的象贊。下兩頁是訃吿，是全冊的正文。以後幾十頁全是要人，名人，文人，聞人，各業鉅子的題字以及古詩，五言詩，七言詩等，內容可說千篇一律，都是對死者不盡不實的頌揚，而直接或間接巧妙地烘托出那顯親揚名的「孝干賢孫」。所題寫的字，包括篆，隸，行，草，楷。楷書裏又分顏，柳，歐，蘇等體。最後，有一篇很長的哀啟。這是「孝子賢孫」自撰或托人捉刀的大文。從死者的高曾祖說起，說到死者的一生。把死者抬到三十三天，形容成古今少有的一個完人。</p>
<p>偉大的集體寫作！不知費了多少聰明才智之士的心血。如果以目前的紙張印刷來計算，這厚厚一冊的成本，該是很可觀的了！</p>
<p>我把這幾冊訃聞，翻閱了一下，呆想：訃聞的作用，在報告死者的生年月日，和死年月日，以及殯葬的日期，使親友們知道。這樣，只須一張紙便够了。其餘的文字，全是多餘的。紙張和印刷，統是浪費了。</p>
<p>眞實地說，所謂「孝午賢孫」，其平日行爲是否「孝」，是否「賢」，是說可完全另一回事。他們大發訃聞的用意，有的在顯親揚名，有的在歛財，有的在名利雙收。</p>
<p>假如這些「孝子賢孫」肯以印發訃聞的錢，捐給學術機關，或用來倣些有益的事，其對社會的貢獻，該不知大若干倍。一般參加訃聞集體寫作的朋友，倘能移其精神爲活人寫作，或做別的有益的事，其對社會的貢獻，也該不知大若于倍</p>
<p>退一步說，死者的確有功於國家社會的，國家社會自有表揚方法。所謂立德，立功，立言，自有其不朽之道，而與是否發訃聞，毫無關係。退一萬步說，就是必須發訃聞，至多一張紙便够了。</p>
<p>「母以善小而不爲，母以惡小而爲之」願一般「孝子賢孫」和文人學士，不再幹這無聊的勾當。</p>

<p>租界中，華人的路名，大家祇知道法租界一條朱葆三路，公共租界一條虞洽卿路，其贊尚有一條麟桂路，在法租界聖母院路西，南起蒲石路，北迄巨籟達路，多數人不大知道。按麟桂係八旗籍，爲道光年問的上海道台，開放法新租界，就是他欣然允諾的。</p>
<p>法租界路名，雖多數係取法國人名，但其中也有發個係別國人名，如愛麥虞限路，係意大利國王名；亞爾培路，係比處時國王名；海格路，係第一次歐戰英名將名；福開　路，係美商人名。</p>
<p>又麥高包綠路，係意大利探險家名，此路名實應照舊譯作馬哥孛羅，即作　界名著馬哥孛羅游記者，渠於元世祖時來中國，爲歐洲人來華的第一人。</p>
<p>又愛多亞路乃係法文譯音，如照英譯，應作愛德華第七路，原來此路名係紀念英王第七世的。</p>
<p>上海人第一次見飛機，係於宜統三年（即辛亥年）五月，由法人環龍携來兩架，在滬表演，不幸於五月六日第一次表演時失事，本人墜機喪命，法租界的環龍路，即爲紀念斯人。</p>
<p>西人的銅像，上海共計有四：一爲英人赫德，係第一任總稅務司，像在外灘江海關前。二爲英公使巴夏禮，像在南京路外灘。三爲法海軍大將卜羅德，像在法大馬路捕房前。按卜係於幫助淸軍攻太平軍時陣亡。四爲一不知名者，在葛羅路捕房後，西人公墓內，作背包步行狀，牆外可見之。</p>
<p>除愛多亞路外灘「和平之神」的像外，北四川路郵政局屋脊上，尙有一「風之神」的像。</p>
<p>馬霍路靜安寺路上，馬房門首的石像，相傳係陸遜（三國時人）墓前的翁仲，該處傳爲陸遜墓址。</p>

<p>黃龍回頭一看，葉二太太在裏邊走出來，他忙放下了手，和葉二太太招呼。葉二太太道：「你們到底是在什麼地方，怎麼一個人先回來，一個人後回來，而且維城回來了，整整的一天不快活，是不是把錢輸光了？輸幾個錢，不算一回事，只要身體沒妨碍，精神沒妨碍，逢塲作戲，又太太平平回來，還有什麼不快活的呢？」維城怕黃龍答的話，和自己告訴嬸娘的前後矛盾，連忙搶着同答，不讓黃龍開口。黃龍也明知維城在撒謊，聽維城說了幾句，他便挿曲似的凑上一句，無非是附和着他。維城把葉二太太對付過去了，向黃龍擠擠眼，葉二太太問黃龍吃過晚飯沒有，黃龍笑道：「二伯母，你不問我，算是吃過了，你要一問我，我是沒有吃過。」維城笑道：「沒人問，是忘了，黃龍哥的嫵媚，就是在這等地方。」葉二太太去通知何媽，快開飯出來給黃龍少爺吃，接着翠珍出來，和黃龍談話，說：「過了明天，一個新年就過了半個了。」</p>
<p>又是晚上，黃龍和維城有了談話的機會，他並不因爲時間的過去而輕减了實問維城的程度，說道：「你會回來，這是誰都想不到的。我們在王順興客棧裏怎麼說的？說的話可以不算，除非讀了一肚子的書的人是這樣，我們肚子裏連一點墨水也沒有的人割了腦袋也不會這樣。」維城只有向他徵笑道：「我說了和你再去，你忙什麼？請你吿訴我往上海去的情形。」黃龍道：一這還用得着問嗎？說得到，就是做得到。我到上海，我到同孚路，看門牌對了，又看門上張着一倏麻布，便敲門。他媽的！門上有個螺旋一樣的圈，旋過去，便有了一個窟窿；旋過來，窟窿便沒有了。裏邊一個老婆子，要我把信塞進去，我就塞進去。老婆子叫我在外邊等，那窟窿倒沒有了。我等了好些時候，還是那個老婆子開了窟窿，說：少爺小姐都沒在家，知道了，你去吧。（二五〇）</p>

<p>近讀中國國民黨史稿第二篇宣傳，深感一種革新之學說，非有普遍之宣傳，不能喚起一般人之重視與同情，此篇所載宣傳革命之各種報紙，略有遺漏，今參加楊棟林中國近世史予以補入，俾當時勞心嘔血者，不致湮沒無聞焉。</p>
<p>戊戍改變後，康梁創淸議報，專以攻擊慈禧及剛毅榮祿爲事。時總理鑒於保皇黨不能澈底革命，僅謀與淸室妥協，流毒所被，爲害極烈，復鑒於倡導革命，非藉新聞紙之普遍宣傳不爲功，爰命陳少白回港創中國日報，倡民族主義，主張革命，是爲鼓吹革命新聞紙之始。同時又有廣東報，有所謂報，少年報等，皆爲本黨之喉舌，惟筆鋒不若中國日報之犀利，目不若中國日報之純粹的爲宣傳報也。上海方面以蘇報爲倡導革命之最著者，該報原爲日人創辦，後由陳範（湖南衡山人，嘗官江西知縣，因案罷官，憤吏治腐敗，思以淸議喚醒國人）。繼主筆政，先屬保皇黨，旋鑒康梁主張之不澈底，乃改依革命派。時有蜀人鄒容者，著革命軍一書，約二萬言，痛心疾首，以維新明志，章炳麟爲之序，蘇報引爲同調，作讀革命軍文以闡揚之，淸廷乃控蘇報於上海會審公堂，而鄒章下獄，此爲淸末文字獄之最大者。</p>
<p>蘇報被禁後，尙有國民報（張等所組織），警鐘日報（蔡元培等所組織），相繼發刋，主張排滿日烈，然不久又被封。各省學生會刊行之報紙，以浙江，江蘇，湖北諸者，皆明目張膽，痛詆淸廷，高談革命。及同盟會成立，設民報黨宣傳，（係就宋敎仁，陳天華兩氏發行之「二十世紀之支那」雜誌改組）張繼任發行人，全筆政者先後有胡漢民等數人頗總理親撰發刊詞。梁啓超亦，悟保皇黨之非，於是改淸議報爲新民叢報，於民主主義頗表贊同，康有爲移書斥之非吾徒，梁自是不敢言民主，再倡君憲。當時所謂兩人派者，爲作正式論戰，君憲派以新民叢報爲根據，後者以民報爲根據，</p>

<h3 id="e1">Obeying Public Order <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War last year, Shanghai has entered a new era, transitioning from British and American rule to a stage of gradual citizen self-governance under Japanese guidance. Every citizen has the right and obligation to participate in public affairs. The most obvious example is the implementation of the Baojia system, giving every citizen the opportunity for self-defense, which is worthy of special mention in Shanghai's local history.</p>
<p>Clearly, maintaining social public order is not only the responsibility of the authorities' police and the Baojia self-defense corps, but also the responsibility of us, the general public. Because Shanghai is a metropolis with more than four million people, the number of police and self-defense corps is naturally limited. The hope for social tranquility lies first and foremost in the general public obeying public order and not engaging in actions that hinder public safety; otherwise, relying solely on the strength of the police and self-defense corps will only be "twice the effort, half the result."</p>
<p>However, in the past, the habit of obeying public order has not been widespread among our people. For example, it is generally considered an honor to be able to do what everyone is forbidden from doing in the law, and those who hear and see it will also express admiration for it. We hope to change this bad habit, which cannot be done overnight, but in the current wartime, we cannot allow ourselves to continue with this bad habit.</p>
<p>Recently, a portion of the citizens in this city could not fully comply with the order during the air defense drills. For example, there were traffic rules during air raids, and at the border between the Public Concession and the French Concession, self-defense corps members often encountered citizens who were unwilling to obey the self-defense corps' inspection of citizen certificates, and argued strongly, making the work of maintaining public order difficult to proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>Therefore, on the one hand, we hope that the self-defense corps recognizes the great responsibility they bear for local safety and social order, and earnestly perform their duties. Of course, they must be polite in their attitude towards their compatriots. On the other hand, what we most hope for is that the general public will obey public order. Don't be so afraid of the police that you can't even speak, but be stubborn and rude when you see the self-defense corps organized by your own compatriots, even maliciously joking and scolding. We want everyone to examine themselves and be vigilant. We want to work together in this wartime to do our best to maintain public order.</p>

<h3 id="e2">The Importance of the North African War and the Axis Counteroffensive - Osaka Mainichi Editorial, December 18 <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Although the enemy's North African landing operation has been disguised and lightly described by Washington as a "small-scale second front," it actually contains great desires and is a major operation launched by the enemy after considerable preparation. The large-scale offensive by the British Eighth Army from Egypt in response to the North African landing, the strengthening of American forces in West Africa and the British mainland that had been going on beforehand, and the despicable wooing of the puppet Darlan all demonstrate their careful planning. No matter how crazy the US and Britain are, would they be willing to stake more than 800 ships, more precious than flesh and blood, for a "small-scale second front"? What they hope for is probably to drive General Rommel out of Africa by a two-pronged attack by the landing forces and the Eighth Army, to seize control of the Mediterranean Sea back into the hands of the US and Britain, and then attempt a landing from the weakest point on the Mediterranean coast of the European continent! Therefore, the success of this move can not only determine the outcome of a local battle, but can also be said to be a landmark in this great war.</p>
<p>The enemy has won some cheap successes at a very small cost. The large-scale landing on the Moroccan side, the early collapse of Algiers caused by Darlan's betrayal, and the British army under Montgomery's advance south of Benghazi, which took advantage of the victory, broke through the middle point between Bizerte and Tunis, and even showed the possibility of attacking the Gabes Gulf.</p>
<p>However, the counteroffensive by our Axis powers should not be underestimated. The German and Italian air forces soon moved in force to the Tunis area; the so-called Tunisia, Sicily, and Sardinia triangle in the narrowest part of the Mediterranean Sea was secured by the Axis air force's iron-wall-like cover: the Mediterranean Sea was cut in two. The enemy's two supply lines, one from Algiers to Tunisia and the other from Egypt to Benghazi, were cut off by the strengthened Axis air force; the ports of Algiers and Libya that the enemy had just regained were subjected to continuous bombing and were already "unusable": the already insufficient ships were successively turned into seaweed in the Mediterranean Sea. Therefore, the land operations reduced their initial power and immediately turned to the defensive. The American and British forces, who had advanced more than ten kilometers to Bizerte, were surrounded by German and Italian mechanized units, and Tabarka was lost one after another, and the sharp spirit of Montgomery was completely lost.</p>
<p>The reversal of the situation is not limited to combat. Politically, it is also increasingly in our favor. Darlan, who was instigated by the United States, and the British-made puppet regime of De Gaulle, clashed head-on, which also affected the rupture of US-British-Soviet diplomatic relations. De Gaulle, after the collapse of France, threw himself into the arms of Britain during its most difficult period, and shared many hardships for more than two years. Now, to abandon him and bring out a naked Darlan who is once again showing anti-British tendencies, is this possible in Britain? If this is true, then the regime of exiles with London as their safe haven will be shaken. These exiles have always been fantasizing about the day of US and British victory, and they are dependent on Britain. Now that they see their masters abandoning them so casually, they will certainly no longer wholeheartedly serve Britain. The Soviet Union, which opposes Darlan, is interfering from within, making the US and Britain even more headache. Therefore, even the United States probably will not permanently support Darlan, using him as a temporary tool in the war, using him for a while, and then discarding him like worn-out shoes, that goes without saying.</p>
<p>The battle situation in North Africa has not yet escaped the initial stage of the war. The German and Italian troops, who are bravely fighting, are improving the battle line every day. This fierce war will probably continue throughout this winter until the US and Britain are truly defeated. If the Axis powers can maintain their current air superiority and continue to inflict fatal blows on US and British ships, causing the US and British forces to suffer a second Dunkirk defeat, perhaps this will become one of the keys to determining the outcome of this great war. Recently, an editorial in the Daily Mail said, "The US and British sides seem to be slightly flustered in the battle of Tunisia." In our view, saying such painful words is actually a piece of good news.</p>

In particular, Chairman Wang expressed his deep admiration for the sincere situation of the Japanese people, who are united as one to advance the completion of the war. Therefore, it is expected that after Chairman Wang returns to China, he will strive to refresh internal affairs, strengthen the National Government, and thoroughly implement the general mobilization of both material and spiritual aspects by promoting the New Citizens Movement, advancing in sharing weal and woe. At the same time, the cooperation and cooperation between the two countries in the second year of the Greater East Asia War will inevitably become even closer.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Chairman Receives Tokyo Reporters at the Guest House, Declares the National Government Will Exert All Its Efforts to Follow Advanced Nations in Completing the War <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Wang, Chairman of the National Government, paid his respects to His Majesty the Emperor this morning. After returning to the guest house, he summoned reporters from various newspaper and news agencies at 11:40 AM. In his address, he stated, “During my visit to your esteemed country last June, I was deeply moved by the gracious hospitality of your court and government. This time, I am deeply honored to have met His Majesty the Emperor again, and I am profoundly grateful for the honor of receiving the most prestigious medal. I am beyond words. Regarding the current situation, I have engaged in frank discussions with Prime Minister Tojo, Foreign Minister Tani, Minister for Greater East Asia Aoki, and other cabinet members. We have reached a common resolution. From now on, our two nations will cooperate and work towards the completion of the Greater East Asia War. A clear path forward has been established, which is truly gratifying. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the soldiers and sailors of your esteemed country have displayed unwavering loyalty and courage, promoting national prestige, and shattering the maritime power and colonies of Britain and the United States in the Eastern Pacific and South Seas. This is not only a glory for your esteemed country, but also a glory for East Asia. The Greater East Asia War has only been ongoing for a year, yet the achievements have been so great, that it inspires immense admiration. Moreover, your court, government, and the people, at this time of successive victories, show not a trace of complacency. The soldiers on the front lines advance bravely, and the people in the rear work diligently and tirelessly. Since my arrival, I have heard and seen the firm resolve and intense dedication of your court, government, and the people everywhere, which reflects the spirit of your head of state. This truly proves that your victories are not accidental. Such a spirit in an advanced nation provides an excellent model for other neighboring countries in East Asia. On the day the Greater East Asia War broke out, the National Government declared its determination to share the joys and sorrows with your esteemed country. Since then, we have deeply felt the weight of our responsibility. We are aware of our impoverished state and fear that our efforts may be insufficient. However, we are determined to encourage ourselves to make some progress, and to share the burden. Internally, we have launched the New National Movement to awaken national mobilization and ensure that the meaning of the Greater East Asia War and the necessity of cooperation are understood. In the past year, preparations have made some headway. As the Greater East Asia War enters its second year, what your esteemed country is diligently pursuing is, first, how to ensure the gains of the past year, and second, how to complete the war as soon as possible. This is the key to the victory of the Greater East Asia War and the foundation for the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The National Government will exert all its efforts to follow advanced nations. This time, we have expressed our sincerity to the government of your esteemed country and have been met with understanding. We have reached a consensus on various cooperation issues, which is a source of deep satisfaction for me, and I can announce this to the citizens of our friendly nations.”</p>
<p>Minister Lin Provides Detailed Answers to Reporters’ Questions</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) – After Lin Baisheng, Minister of Propaganda of the National Government, delivered his address to the Japanese press corps, he answered the various questions raised by the reporters in detail. A transcript of the Q&amp;A follows:</p>
<p>Q: What is the purpose of Chairman Wang’s visit this time?</p>
<p>A: During Chairman Wang's visit to your esteemed country last June, he addressed the journalists, stating that international circumstances are ever-changing, and we must strengthen the East Asian axis to remain constant amidst change. After June, the Greater East Asia War broke out, and China, based on this principle, declared its determination to share joys and sorrows. Both Manchukuo and Thailand also shared the same mind and cooperated with each other. Over the past year, thanks to the heroic battles of your country’s soldiers on the front lines and the diligent service of the people in the rear, as well as the fighting strength of our East Asian nations, the influence of Britain and the United States has been swept away in one fell swoop, laying the foundation for certain victory. Now, as the war enters the decisive stage of its second year, how can we further advance the relationship between our two countries towards the original goals of the peace movement? How can we make the cooperation between our two countries, in line with the development of the war situation, more active and effective? How can China better exert its will and strength to share the responsibility for completing the war? This is an urgent matter. The purpose of Chairman's trip is to sincerely consult with key figures in your country on these key issues, and to express his admiration for the achievements of your country’s court, government, and the people in defending East Asia.</p>
<p>Q: What are the National Government's policies for political, economic, financial, and military self-strengthening?</p>
<p>A: The National Government recognizes that the revival of China and the defense of East Asia are the same responsibility on its shoulders. Political, military, financial, and economic policies are all based on this guiding principle. Self-strengthening is, of course, to enable China to increase its strength, but it is not just for China to increase its strength; more importantly, it is to increase this strength so that it can be further contributed to the defense and construction of East Asia. What I can briefly tell you is that (1) in politics, the first priority is to win the hearts of the people, so that the people of the whole country understand the meaning and responsibility of eradicating the anti-Japanese camp and cooperating in the Greater East Asia War, and to provide them with strict organization and training so that they can assume this responsibility. The mission of the New National Movement lies in this. The second is to strengthen political institutions, improve administrative efficiency, and ensure that everyone and everything can exert the maximum function. The central government's decision-making and the local government's implementation are integrated, and they are promoted one by one according to the needs of the current situation; (2) in the military, in addition to the military strategy against Chongqing’s communist army, we adopt the principle of elite troops, emphasizing both building new armies and reorganizing existing ones. Building new armies is to train new and good armies; reorganization is to transform existing armies from weak to strong. The establishment of the Central Military Academy and the Naval Academy is to train excellent young military officers to establish a central backbone force for peace, anti-communism, and national construction, to serve as a brigade for revitalizing China and defending East Asia. The Central Military Officers' Training Group and the Senior Naval Cadre Training Class are held to gather officers from various units, provide them with political and military training, and enable them to have firm beliefs in the country and in East Asia, to fulfill their responsibilities to maintain local security, protect the people; (3) in terms of finance and economy, in the first year of returning to the capital, it is not easy to talk about revival and construction after the turmoil. Therefore, we first implemented extreme austerity to establish a balance between budget revenue and expenditure, and made the greatest efforts to maintain the remaining vitality, so that the people's livelihood and economy would no longer be undermined. In the second year of returning to the capital, currency reform was used as a lever to establish finance, regulate finance, and promote production, and to strengthen the management of food so as to balance the needs of the people's food. Now we will enter the third stage, that is, the unification and strengthening of the currency system, the adjustment and management of materials, and the goal is to mobilize human and material resources to seek increased productivity. All that is done to strengthen the financial and economic strength of the National Government is also to meet the needs of cooperating to complete the war.</p>
<p>Q: What are the National Government's past and future cooperation strategies for the Greater East Asia War?</p>
<p>A: From the beginning, the National Government recognized its due obligations and responsibilities for the Greater East Asia War. In the declaration of sharing joys and sorrows, we clearly stated the position and determination that the survival and safety of China and Japan are interconnected. We have always stood on the front lines of common life and death. In the past year, China has been in the rear, so it has focused on establishing security and improving people's livelihoods, to fulfill its responsibility to consolidate the rear. The mental and physical response, and the material assistance, goes without saying. However, compared with the brave soldiers of your country charging into battle and the people in the rear enduring hardships, we are ashamed. We do not need to ask how much we have cooperated in the past, but only ask what we should cooperate on in the future. We must face the second year of the Greater East Asia War with a more serious attitude and more concrete actions, to share the obligations of the war. In other words, we not only share joys and sorrows, but we must also share life and death. This was the determination we had early on when the Greater East Asia War broke out, and now we must make greater efforts to put it into practice. As for cooperation with friendly countries in the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, we have always said that in this turning point of the old and new order, East Asian nations must be East Asian comrades or East Asian traitors. Now we must say one more thing: we must make the greatest efforts and sincere cooperation to make East Asian nations all East Asian comrades and not East Asian traitors. East Asian comrades must clearly recognize that they are members of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, following the advanced nations, each doing their best, and then we can talk about coexistence and co-prosperity. From one point of view, we can only survive if we can coexist; from another point of view, we can only cooperate if we each make our own efforts. The cooperation we should do is active and self-initiated cooperation. As for passive and swaying cooperation, it is cooperation in name, but in fact, it is ruining one's own future, adding one burden to East Asia, and adding one exploitable gap to the enemy. This should also be frankly and directly stated to friendly countries in the Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
<p>Q: What are the National Government's thoughts on the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry?</p>
<p>A: During the Greater East Asia War, your country established the Greater East Asia Ministry, which is deeply and greatly related to cooperating in completing the war and establishing the Co-Prosperity Sphere after the war. Since returning to the capital, Minister Aoki has served as the National Government's top economic advisor, and he knows China's situation and its future very deeply, and he helps us more and more. With Minister Aoki serving as the first Minister of Greater East Asia, the National Government and its colleagues have great expectations. Here, I would like to tell you one more thing: at the beginning of the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry, some outsiders said that there is no diplomacy to speak of in the Co-Prosperity Sphere. This is truly unfounded. East Asia must first unite internally today to be able to resist foreign aggression externally. I believe that from now on, East Asian comrades must do their best in diplomacy to seek mutual understanding, mutual trust, and mutual assistance, so that the minds, manpower, and material resources of East Asian countries and nations can be combined to form the basis for externally exerting strong and powerful iron-blooded diplomacy. Therefore, the nature of diplomacy in the future is more important and more meaningful than the scheming and tactics of mutual suspicion and infighting in the old order. In short, East Asian comrades must do their most sincere diplomacy within the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and then they can jointly promote their powerful iron-blooded diplomacy to the Co-Prosperity Sphere. If this is understood, then the strange theory that there is no diplomacy in Greater East Asia will be defeated without being attacked.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Pilgrimage to the Forefront of North China (Dialogue) (2) <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Member of the House of Representatives: Kunitoshi Tsugumo</p>
<p>Secretary-General of the House: Osamu Oki</p>
<p>Translated from December 1941 "Modern"</p>
<p>Oki: Because the underground water is very scarce, coal selection equipment and labor can be saved. The excavated coal can be immediately loaded onto freight cars. In addition, there are very few fault planes. The coal seam spreads horizontally, and does not slope too much. It can be seen from the above that this coal mine has very excellent characteristics. It is now being rapidly developed, and magnificent staff residences have also been completed.</p>
<p>Tsugumo: As soon as you step into Shanxi Province, in front of every station, there are coal blocks with a diameter of two or three feet rolling on the ground. Sometimes they are tied to ropes and carried on the backs of bareback horses. The coal blocks are very large, so they do not need to be put in bags. From the train window, you can see hundreds to thousands of bareback horses carrying coal blocks, with Japanese soldiers escorting them. Limestone, manganese, etc. are also tied to the backs of horses with ropes, and hundreds of horses form a long snake formation to transport them. This is truly spectacular. All of this is helpful to the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Oki: The history of Datong coal is said to be the oldest in the world. Before coal was used in Europe, the Chinese had already used it as a black stone that could burn to cook food. It is said that about six hundred and fifty years ago, Marco Polo saw this scene in Datong and was quite surprised, and specially recorded it in "The Travels of Marco Polo".</p>
<p>Reporter: Besides, what other important resources does Mengjiang have?</p>
<p>Tsugumo: There are also asbestos and mica, which Japan and Manchuria do not have.</p>
<p>Reporter: Did you visit the ruins of Prince Kitashirakawa Yoshihisa?</p>
<p>Tsugumo: We visited the ruins of Prince Kitashirakawa Yoshihisa, saw the Prince's simple life in the camp, and heard the manager's various explanations. Our group could not help but shed tears. People passing by the memorial tower for the fallen soldiers in Qingshuihe, not to mention the Japanese, also the Chinese, Manchus and Mongolians, all sincerely saluted it. I saw this with my own eyes. The vastness of the Prince's posthumous virtue moved me extremely.</p>
<p>Oki: I also accompanied the Speaker to visit the memorial hall where the Prince had lived, and visited the Mengjiang Shrine where the Prince's spirit was enshrined. Hearing the Prince's life in the camp and the manner of his death from the priest, I was moved to tears. Hearing about the efforts made by the Prince for the friendship between Japan and Mongolia, and thinking about the future development of Mongolia, I am truly grateful.</p>
<p>Reporter: It is indeed something to be grateful for. Here, please elaborate on the future importance of North China and Mengjiang.</p>
<p>Tsugumo: Since the Greater East Asia War, the importance of North China and Mengjiang as rear area supply depots has increased even more. For example: there are very few places suitable for salt production in the South, while in North China, as I just said, salt production has a very bright future. Therefore, the salt from the South will be supplied by North China. By combining the resources of the South and the resources of North China, the mass production of war materials and other living materials will be possible. To give one example, if non-ferrous metals, etc., are imported in large quantities from the South, then North China's coal will become absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>Considering these facts comprehensively, after obtaining Southern resources through the Greater East Asia War, the importance of North China as a rear area supply depot will increase even more.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Fierce Fighting Continues in Central Don Area, German Forces to Launch Counter-Offensive <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>German Supreme Headquarters, 22nd (Havas Agency) - Today's German military communique stated that Soviet forces’ attempts to gain a foothold on the opposite bank of the Volga River have not ceased. Fierce fighting continues in the central Don River region. Several German divisions bravely resisted attacking Soviet forces yesterday, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. In the past ten days, 404 Soviet tanks have been destroyed in one sector. In the Soviet Chizhenixi area, German-Hungarian allied suicide squads destroyed multiple Soviet fortresses and returned with captured war material. Attacking enemy forces have been repelled. Bangazi was hit by a night attack, and port facilities were struck by bombs. One enemy torpedo boat was hit and damaged.</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Havas Agency) - Well-informed sources in Berlin revealed that fighting is most intense in the eastern Don River region, apart from the southwestern Stalingrad area. The recent large-scale Soviet offensives were anticipated by German generals, who will take appropriate measures for a counter-offensive. Information regarding when, where, and how the counter-offensive will be conducted cannot be disclosed at this time. In aerial combat, German aircraft continue to have the upper hand, with German aircraft superior in quality and quantity to the enemy. German troops stationed in the southwestern area of Stalingrad remain in a proactive position. There are no significant changes in the situation in Stalingrad.</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Havas Agency) - Official sources have announced the following regarding the Eastern Front: (1) On the central front, the Red Army continues its offensive. The Red Army in this area is personally commanded by Stalin and Marshal Voroshilov. Although the Red Army has suffered many casualties, it continues to reinforce with large numbers of motorized units. However, the Red Army has not yet achieved a decisive victory.</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) - In the recent offensive launched by the Soviet forces in the middle reaches of the Don River, they broke through a portion of the defensive positions of the Axis forces. To avoid unnecessary losses, the German-Italian allied forces temporarily retreated to new rear positions. According to a statement issued by the German military authorities on the afternoon of the 21st, fierce fighting is continuing on the Don River front. Although the Soviet forces launched a fierce attack, disregarding heavy losses, their offensive capability has been weakened. After repeated counter-offensives by the German-Italian forces, their personnel and equipment have been greatly depleted. The German military authorities used the phrase "greatly depleted" in their statement. As this is the first time it has been used, it is not difficult to imagine the extent of the losses suffered by the Soviet forces. The Soviet forces launched a large-scale counter-offensive in the central Don and Volga River regions, but were completely defeated after losing 70 tanks. Currently, the German forces are still holding all their original positions.</p>

Hartford, Connecticut, 20th - Former US Ambassador to Japan, Joseph Grew, recently stated in a speech here that if Japan has the opportunity to develop its resources in the Far East, then its plan to conquer the United States is only a matter of time. I will state without hesitation or reservation that our country and our major cities are under serious threat from the latent power of the Japanese military establishment. This power will enable Japan to become the most powerful country in the world, possibly even more powerful than England, Germany, the Soviet Union, or the United States.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to dispatches from New York, Hugh Drum, commander of the US Eastern Defense Command, issued an order on the 21st, stipulating that new prohibited areas be established in the eastern coastal states of the United States.

<p>Bern, Switzerland, 21st (Havas Agency) - According to official British news, the British-controlled fortress of Gibraltar has been placed under the command of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, commander of the US expeditionary force in North Africa. The announcement has caused considerable shock, as it is the first time since Britain occupied the port in 1704 that it has been placed under the command of a foreign commander. The British side admitted that the matter was decided at the beginning of last month, but it was kept secret until now due to the war situation.</p>

<h3 id="e12">Edible Oil Needed by Various Industries to Be Directly Rationed; Regulations for Government Employees to Purchase Oil to Be Determined Separately <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Edible Oil Wholesale Office continued to purchase 5,000 dan of edible oil from the military allocation authorities and transport it to Shanghai, it originally planned to allocate it to various edible oil retail stores, stipulating that it would be sold based on housing tax and household registration certificates. However, after it was discovered that there were fraudulent housing tax receipts, the method was temporarily changed. The city's 1,830 edible oil stores were merged and divided into two groups, A and B. Group A began selling yesterday (21st) and would sell until the 15th. Group B would sell from the 26th to the 29th. The retail price was 7.1 yuan per catty, and 3.55 yuan per half catty. Yesterday (22nd), many Shanghai citizens lined up to buy oil, and the situation was extremely crowded. The oil was sold out in less than two hours.</p>
<p>Firm Action to Be Taken Against "Oil Rolling"</p>
<p>According to reporters from Datong News Agency who went to inspect various retail oil stores, the stores extended their sales hours yesterday from 9 AM to 5 PM, so the "oil rolling" teams could still be seen. The oil stores selling yesterday belonged to Group A, and each person could buy one catty of soybean oil by presenting an assigned number, without any other procedures. Only a portion of the Group A oil stores sold yesterday. Today, the second group will still consist of 80 stores, which will be scheduled and announced by the wholesale office for people to go and buy.</p>
<p>Direct Allocation of Oil to Various Industries</p>
<p>The wholesale office has decided to directly allocate oil to oil stick businesses, oil frying businesses, and roasted goods businesses that have been registered and approved. Previously, it was stipulated that they could purchase oil daily from designated agent oil supply points or nearby retail stores, and the prices were all the same as the retail price. Now, it has been changed to receiving oil once a month. As for the oil needed by Chinese and Western restaurants, it will be reported and registered individually, and then directly allocated after the quantity is approved. The above-mentioned oil allocation will be based on the oil purchase certificate issued by the wholesale office. When purchasing oil, various businesses must fill out an oil collection slip and abide by the following two principles: (1) The amount of oil required by each business must be filled in truthfully. If it is found that there are false reports, the supply will be stopped immediately. (2) The oil received must be completely used for the needs of the certificate holder's business and must not be stored or transferred to others for use. Regarding the allocation for this period, reporters from Shanghai News Agency learned from the wholesale office yesterday that the allocation procedures have been completed. After sending personnel to verify the facts, oil will be issued based on the certificates and will be completed before the end of this month. The method for government employees to purchase oil will also be formulated separately, so they will not be allowed to participate in retail purchases.</p>
<p>Methods for Allocating Oil Transported to Shanghai</p>
<p>In order to smooth the source of edible oil, the military allocation authorities have ordered edible oil from oil-producing areas such as Dalian, Qingdao, and Tianjin to be transported to Shanghai for relief, and have also purchased oil extracted by various oil mills in Shanghai. In addition, plans are being made to increase the production of various oil mills. Since the conclusion of the Sino-North China Materials Exchange Agreement with North China, 6,000 tons of soybeans, sesame, etc., will be transported to Shanghai according to this agreement. Therefore, the city's oil extraction industry is expected to improve. It is reported that the allocation methods for soybeans and sesame are: (1) Japanese oil mills (8) will receive 75% of the full amount; (2) Chinese oil mills (4) will receive 25% of the full amount. It is expected that starting next spring, the operating rate of Chinese and Japanese oil mills can reach 40%. If the supply of raw materials is received later, the operating rate can be increased again, and the fear of edible oil shortages in Shanghai can be alleviated. If all oil mills completely resume oil production, the amount of oil produced will be sufficient for use.</p>

Request to Increase Sugar Supply to 50,000 Bags in January. <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sugar Merchants' Cooperative has already completed the distribution of 30,000 bags of sugar for this month, and retailers are selling it daily or every other day in accordance with the cooperative's regulations. The second phase of special allocations to various industries is also continuing to be verified. Yesterday, the cooperative announced to the Shanghai News Agency reporter that the sources of sugar have been very smooth recently, and deliveries have been arriving in Shanghai one after another. Now that the Lunar New Year is approaching and households are using more sugar, the cooperative plans to increase the allocation of sugar to 50,000 bags in January and has requested approval from the authorities. Since the implementation of purchasing sugar with property tax receipts or citizen cards, purchases have become more common, but profiteers are still sabotaging the system in various ways. In order to protect the legitimate interests of households, meticulous discussions are underway, and the most complete method should be implemented soon. Recently, some profiteers have forged tax receipts for purchasing sugar or altered the receipts. The authorities have arrested many of them in recent days.</p>

<h3 id="e19">The U.S. and Britain Criticize Anti-Religious Groups. Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama Refutes Them. The Two English-Speaking Countries Use Religion as a Tool of Aggression. <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Domei News Agency, Shanghai dispatch: Yesterday, Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama, spokesman for the Army Press Department, strongly refuted the accusations made by the United States and Britain against Japan's anti-religious groups in the Far East, and urged attention to the fact that Britain and the United States, which claim to be Christian countries, incited anti-Japanese sentiment in China and held political demonstrations during the Spanish Revolution. Mr. Yokoyama said that these two English-speaking countries use religion as a tool. Their broadcasts attack Japan on this point, which is actually a broadcast that violates God's will. After all, broadcasting is a planned propaganda. Before the U.S. Air Force attacked Japan in the spring, San Francisco radio praised the spirit of the Japanese Bushido. Japan was negligent in its defense. Britain and the United States preached in China under the guise of loving mankind, but only aroused anti-Japanese sentiments. The Constitution of Japan, within Japan and its military, guarantees religious freedom within the scope of peace and order, and a protection team has been specially established, whose work is to consider how religious groups' doctrines are, regardless of their doctrines. This evidence is sufficient to show the falsehood of the propaganda of the United States and Britain and the fairness of Japan in the religious world.</p>

<p>Christmas is the day after tomorrow. Yesterday, we received a letter from the Christian Wang Youdao, which is very meaningful and is recorded below: "After reading your newspaper's editorial, 'Abolishing Christmas Customs,' I was deeply moved. This year, when we celebrate the festival here, we can no longer live in a drunken stupor, singing and dancing as we have in the past. Instead, every citizen needs to take on a part of the responsibility, prepare new ways to celebrate, and implement the spirit of Jesus' universal love. Abolish all unnecessary extravagance, and concentrate the money spent on festivals in large stores, teahouses, restaurants, and dance halls to donate to your charity fund, to rescue our fellow Chinese who have fallen into destitution on the streets of Shanghai, without clothing, food, home, or hometown, so that they can get warmth and food, a place to live, and the opportunity to learn skills to support themselves. It can also help the children of the poor who have dropped out of school."</p>

<p>The Resumption Issue is Scheduled for January</p>
<p>Shen Bao Monthly Magazine was founded in 1932. It was well-received by readers for its rich content and appropriate compilation. In 1935, it was changed to a weekly magazine, and sales increased greatly, reaching over 150,000 copies. It was forced to suspend publication until the August 13th Incident in Shanghai. Recently, the situation has changed again, and order has been restored. In view of the decline of the domestic publishing industry and the lack of spiritual sustenance felt by the general public, this newspaper has decided to resume publication of the monthly magazine. The resumption issue is scheduled to be published on January 16th next year, and editing has already begun. In addition to special contributions, we also hope that scholars in China will contribute articles. A special section will be opened in each issue, soliciting articles on a specific topic. The topic for the first solicitation has been set as "The Food Problem and its Countermeasures," because the food problem is becoming increasingly serious and has a significant impact on the public. The Shen Bao Monthly Magazine takes this as its topic in order to explore countermeasures for the authorities to adopt and regulate people's livelihood.</p>

<h3 id="e23">Remain Vigilant and Prepared After the End of the Air Defense Drill. The Scope is Wider and the Tasks of the Police are More Onerous. <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Today is the last day of the second comprehensive air defense control training, which began on the 14th of this month. The highest air defense authorities in Shanghai, the military agencies, the air defense departments of the two concession police forces, and the relevant officials in the districts outside the concessions are very satisfied with the results of the past nine days of training compared with the initial control in early October. What is more noteworthy is that the scope of this air defense training is wider than the last time. In addition to the light control, there are also fire fighting, rescue, poison gas prevention, sound control, and traffic alert exercises. It is truly commendable to have achieved better results within a wider scope. The Inspector General of the Public Works Department has greatly praised this, believing that it is the result of the sincere cooperation between the citizens and the authorities and the diligent performance of their duties by the Baojia Self-Defense Corps. Today is the last day. It is hoped that the people of the city will maintain the same spirit from beginning to end, remain vigilant and prepared at all times, and ensure safety.</p>
<p>Comprehensive Drill on Nanjing Road</p>
<p>Yesterday's air defense control was different from usual. At 6:00 a.m., the air raid siren sounded loudly, and residents were awakened from their dreams. The sound of engines was heard, and the situation was extremely tense. All vehicles on the street stopped, and the departure time of trams and buses was also delayed. The alert was lifted after two hours. During the day, police officers in each district, together with the Baojia Self-Defense Corps, held fire drills. The situation was similar to the air raid control in the evening. First, from 5:30 p.m. to 8:00 p.m., a comprehensive air defense, rescue, poison gas prevention, and fire drill was held on Nanjing Road, between Shanxi Road and Yu Qiaqing Road. Traffic was temporarily cut off. During the drill, the Inspector General of the Public Works Department and Deputy Inspector Matsumoto personally inspected the drill.</p>
<p>Grenade Drill on Route du Père Huc</p>
<p>At noon on the 21st, the 176th Joint Bao of the Central District of the French Concession held an expanded grenade and arson drill in Lane 434 of Route du Père Huc. The units participating included the French Concession Police Department, the Engineering Department, the Fire Department, the Health Department, and the Central District Baojia Office. District Chief Yu Zhijing personally attended the scene, leading the Joint Bao Chief Fan Yonglian and the Baojia personnel in charge to conduct a realistic performance. First, police officers ignited a small smoke bomb in the lane, and the smoke immediately rose. The duty police officer reported to the police station by telephone. At the same time, members of the civil police group were dispatched in shifts. Because the smoke was overwhelming, all participating civil police officers used wet towels to protect their mouths and noses. First, the traffic team was dispatched to maintain traffic order. The sidewalk was cordoned off with ropes to prevent pedestrians from approaching the scene. One traffic officer held a red flag to indicate the location of the incident. Then, firefighters arrived at the scene to put out the fire, and the rescue team was dispatched to carry the injured on stretchers. At the same time, fire trucks and ambulances arrived at the scene one after another, pushing up ladders and connecting water hoses. Stretchers from the ambulances were also carried out one after another. At the same time, the tram company also dispatched two buses (to transport the lightly injured). All participating personnel wore gas masks, and the situation was very tense and realistic. Eighty people were carried out of the fire, all of whom were taken by the ambulance to the Guangci Hospital for treatment. All the doctors and nurses of the hospital were dispatched to take the injured, take names, examine the severity of the injuries, and place them in wards, and carry out rescue work, such as artificial respiration and various bandages. At the same time, work continued at the scene of the incident. After the smoke was extinguished, the cleaning team of the Cleaning Bureau, together with the members of the cleaning team of the Joint Bao, cleaned up the fire scene. At this point, the drill ended, and the various teams returned to their respective units one after another. The observers from various agencies praised the results of this drill as excellent, surpassing the previous few times. The participants and observers in this drill included Fabre, Chief of the French Concession Police Department; Deputy Drill Master Elly; Deputy Chief Blancsy; Deputy Superintendent Meicai Ge; Pu Sake, Chief of the Central Police Station; Lai Hana, Deputy Chief; Inspector Zhou Shangyi; and the chiefs and deputy chiefs and inspectors of various police stations.

<p>South of Fuzhou Road Under Its Jurisdiction</p>
<p>Mr. Uemura, the patrol officer in charge of the Laozha Police Station's Vice Squad, along with Deputy Patrol Officers Bao Tianyi and Huang Fugen, have planned to designate a prostitution zone due to the proliferation of prostitutes within the jurisdiction, especially the occasional prostitutes soliciting customers along Nanjing Road, Zhejiang Road, and other places every night, which is unsightly. General licensed prostitutes are allowed to operate within the designated area, which is from East Freedom East Road in the east to Yu Qiaqing Road in the west, and from Avenue Edward VII in the south to Fuzhou Road in the north.

As a result, the bustling areas of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road have no longer seen occasional prostitutes standing on the street.</p>

<p>Ma Pu'an, a reviewer in the accounting department of a bank, overdrawn 15,250 yuan from the bank on the 6th of this month using a check from his own account. He then took the money to the Yong'an gambling den in Nanshi, where he lost it all in less than an hour. Because he could not return the bank funds, he went to the Central Police Station to falsely report that he had been robbed. However, Detective Yao Bingsong discovered the truth, detained Ma, and escorted him to the Special First Court for interrogation. Detective Yao also discovered that Xiang Sheng, Zheng Ning, Chang Tai, and other money shops in Shanghai had received four remittance slips issued by the Baxianqiao branch, totaling 23,300 yuan. After discovering that the remittance slips were forged, the police were asked to investigate. After questioning Ma, he learned that Wei Baohua, a native of Yangzhou who had been transferred from the Baxianqiao branch to the head office, was highly suspected. The detective then arrested Wei. Under strict interrogation, Luo confessed that when he was in the Xianji branch, he had stolen a book of remittance slips issued by the preparatory treasury, and at the same time, he had stolen a canceled genuine remittance slip. Later, he met Wang Zifeng in the Yong'an gambling den. Wang talked about expanding capital in order to gamble wildly in the gambling den and win. Yu then handed over the stolen blank remittance slip book and a canceled genuine remittance slip to Wang, and Wang forged it according to the signature pattern on the genuine slip. However, since the delivery, Wang has not been seen, so he does not know how he issued the fake remittance slips. Yesterday, the Special First Court interrogated Ma and Luo together. The two admitted all of the above facts. The court ordered the conclusion of the confession and waited for the verdict.</p>

Regarding the cultivation and production of tobacco, the vicinity of Hangzhou in Zhejiang Province and areas such as Xinchang and Shengxian in eastern Zhejiang have historically produced it. However, merchants in the producing areas have primarily used it to make local tobacco (dry tobacco). Since the beginning of this year, tobacco leaves produced in the vicinity of Hangzhou have been transported to Shanghai, where tobacco merchants have been using them to manufacture cigarettes, generating substantial profits. However, due to transportation difficulties and the fact that Japanese tobacco leaves are subject to control, few people are engaged in this business. According to information obtained by a business reporter, recently in the Hangzhou area, under the leadership of the Japanese authorities and Japanese tobacco merchants, a "Hangzhou Area Tobacco Purchase Association" has been established. The inaugural meeting was held on the 18th of this month. The purpose of the association is to centrally purchase tobacco leaves from the Hangzhou area for use as raw materials in Shanghai cigarette factories. Regarding the tobacco leaf purchase activities of the Tobacco Purchase Association, in accordance with the instructions of the relevant authorities, a notice was issued to all tobacco merchants on the 19th: (1) All Chinese and Japanese tobacco leaf merchants must go to the Purchase Association to apply for registration before December 23rd; (2) Each tobacco leaf merchant should declare the type and quantity of tobacco leaves and the original purchase price in a suitable format; (3) According to the association's principles, no one who is not a member of the association may purchase tobacco or transport it; (4) The purchase price of the tobacco leaf will be decided by the authorities' notification, so purchasing is temporarily suspended. According to people in the tobacco industry in this city, if the Hangzhou tobacco industry can be purchased effectively in the future, then the raw materials for cigarette production in Shanghai can be partially resolved.</p>
<p>Food Problem Forum</p>
<h3 id="e38">A Humble Wish <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan Jiu</p>
<p>The severity of the food problem is constantly increasing! Readers of this newspaper have been urgently appealing before, and relevant authorities have issued statements after. Its impact on politics and economics has been fully revealed. Now, from the standpoint of a citizen, I respectfully offer the following humble suggestions:</p>
<p>Stopgap Measures: The Municipal Chamber of Commerce should convene various trade associations to raise funds and negotiate temporary loans with the banking community, especially the Central Reserve Bank, to provide as much assistance as possible, so that price policy and currency policy can be integrated. Cooperate with the Baojia Committee to submit a request to the authorities to purchase rice from the outskirts of the city and implement public sales to supplement the shortage of household rice rations.</p>
<p>Fundamental Solution: The authorities of the two concessions and the administrative authorities of the Peace Zone should consult with each other to unblock the source of rice and increase the amount of household rice rations. At the same time, improve the quality of the rice so that it is sufficient for consumption.</p>
<p>Supplementary Measures: Prohibit and search rice shops and households for hoarding behavior, and set price limits for rice vendors to prevent them from taking advantage of the situation and affecting the lives of ordinary people.</p>
<p>It is hoped that the above three measures can be implemented step by step immediately! Every day of delay means that the people suffer one more day! The local economy of Shanghai will experience more instability! At the same time, the food panic in Shanghai will stimulate rising prices and also affect prices in the Peace Zone. Therefore, a satisfactory solution to the food problem in Shanghai will greatly help the price control policy in the Peace Zone. This is not a simple local problem in Shanghai, or a related problem in the Peace Zone, but a fundamental issue for the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere!</p>
<p>The Real Reason for the Steep Rise in Rice Prices — Yi Min</p>
<p>(1) Unscrupulous merchants hoard rice in the suburbs of Shanghai: In the past two months, unscrupulous merchants, seeing that the price of rice in the suburbs of Shanghai was about 240 yuan per dan, have withdrawn funds from banks and hoarded large quantities of rice in Kunshan, Suzhou, Nanxiang, Dachang, Pudong, Jiangwan, Wusong, etc., so that when the time comes when the old harvest is exhausted and the new harvest has not yet arrived, they can transport it to Shanghai to make huge profits. As a result, the rice on the market has been greatly reduced, and prices have risen sharply.</p>
<p>(2) Rice vendors spread rumors: As soon as rumors spread, the price of rice immediately increased. Especially the people of Shanghai, seeing the high price of rice, were also greatly panicked, buying more and more at higher and higher prices. This is the work of rice vendors. The only way to stop the malpractices of unscrupulous merchants and rice vendors is to increase the quantity of household rice rations by the Public Works Department and severely crack down on hoarding rice in the suburbs. If possible, the selling price of rice vendors should be suppressed.</p>
<p>Points to Note for a Comprehensive Solution — Ren Lin</p>
<p>The solution to the food problem should not be governed by different policies in different places, but should have a unified approach. I would like to put forward a few fundamental points to note for the authorities' reference and for the study of the people of the country:</p>
<p>(1) Food should be subject to strict and planned control, and the past state of free trade and arbitrary manipulation should be absolutely prohibited to prevent unscrupulous merchants from causing trouble.</p>
<p>(2) The scope of the food control area should be extended to the entire Peace Zone.</p>
<p>(3) The price of rice is the center of general price fluctuations in Central China. It is absolutely impossible to treat the rice price index as equivalent to other price indices. Therefore, the establishment of a uniform rice price must be very cautious.</p>
<p>(4) The decision on the price of rice must take into account the interests of both producers and consumers. Otherwise, it will still be harmful and unprofitable, and it will be difficult to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. The price of rice must include the farmer's production costs and reasonable profits in order to establish a uniform standard for the entire Peace Zone, and then refer to the situation in various places and add the necessary transportation and sales costs, and increase or decrease it appropriately according to this standard to become the natural price for each place.</p>
<p>(5) The transportation and sale of food must have an overall plan and reasonable allocation so that various places can achieve mutual communication and regulate surpluses and deficits.</p>
<p>(6) Strengthen the connection between rural production in various places and the consumption of neighboring cities. The need for food should be based on local supply as a principle. If there is a surplus, it should be used to supply the deficiencies of other places, and if there is a deficiency, it should be supplied from the surplus of other places.</p>
<p>(7) As for the food procurement agencies, they also need to be thoroughly reformed. In the Qingxiang areas where security has been established, the government can directly purchase to avoid the exploitation of merchants. In areas that have not yet been Qingxiang, direct procurement is more difficult, so it can still be handled by rice merchants, etc., but the government must not maintain the interests of a few agents, let alone plan for the interests of a few landlords and incur resentment from the people. In short, food procurement must be based on the spirit of public agreement in order to maintain the interests of the general public, stabilize people's livelihoods, and consolidate security.</p>
<p>(8) As for the sales agencies, they also need to be reformed. In the Qingxiang areas, household surveys have been completed, and a system of rationing food according to population can also be adopted. As for the areas that have not yet been Qingxiang, a public sales method can be adopted, and then a system of rationing food according to population will be adopted after the Qingxiang is completed in the future.</p>
<p>(9) The quantity of food rationed must be rationally and detailedly regulated to meet the needs of each individual.</p>
<p>(10) Restrictions and prohibitions must be placed on unnecessary consumption such as wine and pastries.</p>

<p>Although the Chinese stock market continued to decline yesterday, it showed a trend of first falling and then rebounding on the same day. The shaky confidence of all parties has stabilized. Because the price has fallen too much in the past four days, investors have taken the opportunity to act, and the investment enthusiasm is relatively strong. However, the morning opening has already caused a huge setback, resulting in a small squeeze at the end. The rise and fall of department stores are the most active. Wing On Company fell to 123 yuan, the same as 27 and a half yuan. Sincere once rose to 140 yuan, then 37 and a half yuan, both down a small 2 and a half yuan. National goods were 75 yuan, down a small 1 yuan. Underwear retreated to the edge of 30 yuan. In the textile industry, Wing On Spinning Factory broke into 1,800 yuan and then rebounded, squeezing a small 20 yuan. Small denomination shares remained flat. Fochang Dyeing and Weaving fell again to 15 yuan. Rongfeng fell sharply by another 3 yuan. The Huashang public utilities, which were less subject to the main, fell to within 40 yuan, down a small 1 and a half yuan. The Zhabei water and electricity were around 60 yuan, down 1 yuan. The Great China Match except that the price was 360 yuan, Nanyang Tobacco was down a small 2 yuan. The cultural industry fell the most severely. Commercial Press fell sharply by 15 yuan. China fell by 7 and a half yuan. The world was also down a small 2 yuan, around 103 yuan. In the new pharmaceutical industry, only Sino-French Dispensary did 455 yuan, up 5 yuan alone. Sino-French was 26.25 yuan, slightly tired. Minyi saw a low price of 72 yuan again. Xinyi fell by 10 yuan. Star Perfume was 220 yuan. Financial stocks still had no sellers. Food stocks were stable and firm. Guanshengyuan had buyers at 410 yuan. A certain account of Kangyuan Confectionery absorbed quite a lot. Meilin Food was 1,200 yuan. Other stocks were still stable. Transactions were rare. Listed below:</p>

<p>The bond market was even more unsustainable yesterday. Sellers were in a hurry and could not choose, while buyers were extremely rare, resulting in lower and lower selling prices. Because the silver root is getting tighter, the banks are urging the redemption of collateral, and they have no choice but to depreciate and seek to sell. Type C once broke 4 yuan, and finally did 4 yuan and 34 cents, which was 2 yuan less than before. Type A was 2 yuan and 57 cents, Type B was priced at 2 yuan and 78 cents, Type D was firmer at around 1 yuan and 50 cents, and Type E was about 2 yuan and 34 cents. Except for Type C, which had some transactions, the rest were only quotes without trades.</p>

It was said that it had risen to 2,840 yuan, and once stepped down to around 2,810 yuan. At noon, it was 2,820 yuan, which was 30 yuan less than the previous day. Transactions are light. As for ornaments and silver, each tael is still listed at 16 yuan. The inter-industry transaction price has retreated to 17 yuan.</p>

<p>Coarse Cloth is Uniquely Firm</p>
<p>Factory Cloth: The white goods market was stable yesterday, and the colored goods turned down, because the industry's silver root is very tight, and the hand goods have quite a lot of sales. Only coarse cloth is the firmest. 14-pound Earth coarse cloth still needs 233 yuan. Fine cloth is slightly soft. 12-pound Earth coarse cloth opened at 194 yuan in the morning, and there were no transactions in the afternoon market. Fugui Da Zhu shouted a price of about 193 yuan. The receiving price of Peach Blossom Lady Lin Wu was 316 yuan, a drop of about 4 yuan.</p>

<p>The standard market price of woolen fabrics was still firm both overtly and covertly yesterday. Regardless of the thickness, the price of goods for cold and summer has only increased and not decreased. None of the wool, cotton, silk, and linen yarn woven products are not expensive in the current market. Currently, 6-inch horsehair lining is sold for 4 yuan per yard, 9-inch is 5 yuan, Taijitu soft lining is 7 yuan and 6 jiao, 1470 French lining is 6 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen, Whale Star hemp cloth is 10 yuan, Dafugui is 9 yuan and 6 jiao, Yousheng Golden Bear brand rainproof cloth is 23 yuan, and Daya yarn back satin is 12 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>

<p>The price of upper-grade dried longan has gradually become active due to the excessively loose opening price of the previous customs industry.

<p>Yesterday, the sesame nail trade was still clear, because the goods are going to be removed, most of them are currently stopped. Although the wood street manufacturers and retail customers are also idle, the real sales of the whole are difficult to smooth. People are not very optimistic about the good market for other goods of this color. Currently, the market price of three-point color is 1,500 yuan per box, four-point color straw box is 1,400 yuan, five-point goods are 1,300 yuan per opening, and six-point color is shouted at 1,200 yuan.

<h3 id="e50">Why Send Obituaries <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— Objective</p>
<p>In the basket of a waste paper buyer, I saw several books of obituaries, all of which were thick volumes, clean white Lian Shi paper, blue cover, thread-bound, and the printing and everything else were very exquisite and beautiful.</p>
<p>On the cover was the inscription of a certain celebrity. The first page was a copperplate photo of the deceased, with the inscription of a certain important person on the photo, and an elegy by a certain poet under the photo. The next two pages were the obituary, which was the main text of the entire book. The following dozens of pages were all inscriptions by important people, celebrities, literati, famous people, and giants from all walks of life, as well as ancient poems, five-character poems, and seven-character poems. The content can be said to be the same, all of which are insincere praises for the deceased, and directly or indirectly cleverly highlight the "filial and virtuous grandchildren" who are showing off their relatives and making a name for themselves. The words inscribed included seal script, official script, running script, cursive script, and regular script. The regular script was further divided into Yan, Liu, Ou, Su, and other styles. Finally, there was a very long elegy. This was a great essay written by the "filial sons and virtuous grandchildren" themselves or entrusted to someone to write. Starting from the deceased's great-great-grandparents, it talked about the deceased's life. It elevated the deceased to the thirty-third heaven, describing him as a perfect person rarely seen in ancient and modern times.</p>
<p>Great collective writing! I don't know how much effort the minds of talented and intelligent people have spent. If calculated based on the current paper and printing, the cost of this thick book should be considerable!</p>
<p>I flipped through these obituaries and thought blankly: The role of an obituary is to report the deceased's date of birth and death, as well as the date of the funeral, so that relatives and friends know. In this way, only one piece of paper is enough. The rest of the text is all superfluous. The paper and printing are all wasted.</p>
<p>To be honest, whether the so-called "filial sons and virtuous grandchildren" are "filial" or "virtuous" in their daily behavior is completely another matter. The intention of their sending out obituaries on a large scale is sometimes to show off their relatives and make a name for themselves, sometimes to collect money, and sometimes to gain both fame and wealth.</p>
<p>If these "filial sons and virtuous grandchildren" are willing to donate the money used to print and distribute obituaries to academic institutions, or use it to do some beneficial things, their contribution to society would be many times greater. If the friends who participate in the collective writing of obituaries can shift their energy to writing for the living or doing other beneficial things, their contribution to society should also be many times greater.</p>
<p>To take a step back, if the deceased has indeed made contributions to the country and society, the country and society have their own methods of commendation. The so-called establishing virtue, establishing merit, and establishing words have their own immortal ways, which have nothing to do with whether or not to send out obituaries. To take ten thousand steps back, even if it is necessary to send out obituaries, at most one piece of paper is enough.</p>
<p>"Do not do good because it is small, and do not do evil because it is small." I hope that the general "filial sons and virtuous grandchildren" and literati and scholars will no longer do this boring thing.</p>

<p>In the concessions, everyone only knows Zhu Baosan Road in the French Concession and Yu Qiaqing Road in the Public Concession. In fact, there is also Lin Gui Road, which is located west of the Sacred Heart Hospital Road in the French Concession, starting from Bubbling Well Road in the south and ending at Route Gustale Frey in the north. Most people don't know much about it. According to records, Lin Gui was a banner man and was the Shanghai Daotai during the Daoguang reign. He was the one who gladly agreed to the opening of the French New Concession.</p>
<p>Although most of the street names in the French Concession are taken from French names, some of them are also taken from foreign names, such as Avenue Emile Guimet, which is the name of the King of Italy; Route Albert, which is the name of the King of Belgium at the time; Avenue Haig, which is the name of a famous British general in the First European War; and Avenue Foch, which is the name of an American merchant.</p>
<p>Also, Route Marco Polo is the name of an Italian explorer. This street name should actually be translated as Marco Polo as before, that is, the famous traveler Marco Polo, who came to China during the reign of Kublai Khan and was the first European to come to China.</p>
<p>Also, Avenue Edward VII is a French transliteration. If translated according to English, it should be Avenue Edward VII. Originally, this street name was to commemorate King Edward VII of England.</p>
<p>The first time Shanghainese saw an airplane was in May of the third year of Xuantong (i.e., 1911), when two airplanes were brought to Shanghai by a Frenchman, Huan Long, to perform. Unfortunately, on May 6, the first performance was an accident, and the person himself died in the crash. Route Huan Long in the French Concession was to commemorate this person.</p>
<p>There are a total of four bronze statues of Westerners in Shanghai: one is of Robert Hart, a Briton, who was the first Inspector General of Customs. The statue is in front of the Jianghai Customs on the Bund. The second is of the British Minister Harry Parkes, the statue is on the Bund of Nanjing Road. The third is of the French naval admiral Protet, the statue is in front of the police station on Avenue Joffre. According to records, Protet died while helping the Qing army attack the Taiping army. The fourth is of an unknown person, behind the police station on Great Western Road, in the shape of walking with a backpack, which can be seen outside the wall inside the Western cemetery.</p>
<p>In addition to the statue of the "Goddess of Peace" on the Bund of Avenue Edward VII, there is also a statue of the "God of Wind" on the ridge of the post office on North Sichuan Road.</p>
<p>The stone statues in front of the horse room on Route Mahé are said to be the stone figures in front of Lu Xun's tomb (a man from the Three Kingdoms period). The location is said to be the site of Lu Xun's tomb.</p>
<p>The most special street name is "West Shanglin" at the east end of Shilu Road, starting from Guangdong Road in the north and ending at Route Edward VII in the south.</p>

<p>One, two, and then "Backyard Flower"</p>
<p>Huang Long looked back and saw Mrs. Ye Er walking out from inside. He quickly put down his hand and greeted Mrs. Ye Er. Mrs. Ye Er said, "Where exactly are you two? Why did one person come back first and one person come back later? And Weicheng has been unhappy all day since he came back. Did you lose all your money? Losing some money is not a big deal. As long as your body is not harmed and your spirit is not harmed, it's just a play. If you come back safe and sound, what's there to be unhappy about?" Weicheng was afraid that Huang Long's answer would contradict what he had told his aunt, so he quickly interrupted and answered, not allowing Huang Long to speak. Huang Long also knew that Weicheng was lying. After listening to Weicheng's few words, he chimed in like an interlude, just echoing him. Weicheng managed to deal with Mrs. Ye Er, winking at Huang Long. Mrs. Ye Er asked Huang Long if he had eaten dinner. Huang Long laughed and said, "Second Aunt, if you don't ask me, it's as if I've eaten. If you ask me, then I haven't eaten." Weicheng laughed and said, "If no one asks, it's forgotten. Huang Long Ge's charm is in these kinds of places." Mrs. Ye Er went to inform Aunt He to quickly serve dinner for Huang Long Shao Ye. Then Cuizhen came out to talk to Huang Long, saying, "After tomorrow, half of the New Year will be over."</p>
<p>Again it was night, and Huang Long and Weicheng had the opportunity to talk. He did not reduce his inquiry of Weicheng because of the passage of time, saying, "That you would come back, no one would have expected. What did we say at Wang Shunxing Inn? What was said doesn't count, unless it's people who have read a bellyful of books who are like that. People like us who don't even have a drop of ink in our bellies wouldn't be like that even if we cut off our heads." Weicheng could only give him a forced smile, saying, "I said I'd go with you again. What are you busy doing? Please tell me about the situation of going to Shanghai." Huang Long said, "Does this need to be asked? What I say, I can do. I went to Shanghai, I went to Tongfu Road, saw that the door number was right, and saw a wisp of hemp cloth hanging on the door, so I knocked on the door. Damn it! There was a spiral-like circle on the door. Twist it, and there was a hole; twist it back, and the hole disappeared. An old woman inside wanted me to stuff the letter in. I stuffed it in. The old woman told me to wait outside, and the hole disappeared. I waited a long time, and it was still the old woman who opened the hole, saying: The young master and young lady are not at home, I know, you can go." (250)</p>
<h3 id="e53">Newspapers in Revolutionary History <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Middle</p>
<p>Recently, after reading the second chapter on propaganda in the "Draft History of the Chinese Kuomintang," I deeply felt that a revolutionary theory, without widespread propaganda, cannot arouse the attention and sympathy of the general public. This chapter, which records various newspapers that promoted the revolution, has some omissions. Now, I add information from Yang Donglin's "Modern History of China" to supplement it, so that those who worked hard and shed blood at that time will not be forgotten.</p>
<p>After the Reform Movement of 1898, Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao founded the "Qing Yi Bao" (Public Opinion Newspaper), which specialized in attacking Empress Dowager Cixi and the officials Gangyi and Ronglu. At that time, Sun Yat-sen, realizing that the royalist party could not thoroughly carry out the revolution and only sought compromise with the Qing Dynasty, whose poisonous influence was extremely harmful, and also realizing that advocating revolution could not succeed without the widespread propaganda of newspapers, ordered Chen Shaobai to return to Hong Kong to found the "China Daily," advocating nationalism and promoting revolution. This was the beginning of newspapers advocating revolution. At the same time, there were also the "Guangdong Bao," "You Suowei Bao," "Shaonian Bao" (Youth Newspaper), and others, all mouthpieces of the party. However, their writing style was not as sharp as that of the "China Daily," and their purpose was not as purely for propaganda as that of the "China Daily." In Shanghai, the "Su Bao" was the most prominent in advocating revolution. This newspaper was originally founded by a Japanese person. Later, Chen Fan (from Hengshan, Hunan Province, who had served as a magistrate in Jiangxi and was dismissed due to a case, resentful of the corruption of officialdom and hoping to awaken the Chinese people through public opinion) took over as editor-in-chief. Initially, he belonged to the royalist party, but later, realizing that Kang and Liang's advocacy was not thorough, he switched to the revolutionary faction. At that time, Zou Rong, a native of Sichuan, wrote the book "The Revolutionary Army," about 20,000 words, expressing his grief and determination to revitalize China. Zhang Binglin wrote a preface for it. "Su Bao" regarded it as an ally and published the article "Reading 'The Revolutionary Army'" to promote it. The Qing government then sued "Su Bao" in the Shanghai Mixed Court, and Zou and Zhang were imprisoned. This was the largest literary inquisition of the late Qing Dynasty.</p>
<p>After the "Su Bao" was banned, there were still the "Guomin Bao" (organized by Zhang Taiyan and others) and the "Jingzhong Ribao" (Alarm Bell Daily, organized by Cai Yuanpei and others), which were published one after another, advocating the expulsion of the Manchus with increasing fervor, but they were soon banned as well. The newspapers published by student associations in various provinces, especially those in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Hubei, openly and boldly criticized the Qing government and discussed revolution at length. When the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance) was established, it set up the "Min Bao" (People's Journal) for party propaganda (reorganized from the magazine "China in the 20th Century" published by Song Jiaoren and Chen Tianhua). Zhang Taiyan served as the publisher, and Hu Hanmin and others successively took charge of the writing. Sun Yat-sen personally wrote the inaugural statement. Liang Qichao also realized the wrongness of the royalist party and changed the "Qing Yi Bao" to the "Xinmin Congbao" (New People's Journal), expressing approval of democracy. Kang Youwei wrote a letter criticizing him as no longer his disciple. Liang then dared not speak of democracy again and instead advocated constitutional monarchy. At that time, the so-called two factions engaged in formal debates, with the constitutional monarchists based on the "Xinmin Congbao" and the revolutionaries based on the "Min Bao."</p>

<p>In the above nineteen locations, the two parties used writing to promote their ideas. Among them, the "Min Bao" and "Zhongxing Bao" were the mainstays, and the debates were the fiercest. Sun Yat-sen wrote articles to refute them. The "Xinmin Ye Bao" and "Nanyang Zonghui Xinbao" were far from their match. The students in Paris' "Xin Shiji" often debated with each other. Ultimately, because the people's hearts trended towards revolution, the "Min Bao"'s arguments received more sympathy from readers, and newspapers in various places also clearly divided into two factions. The ones that can be examined are listed in the table below:</p>
<p>Royalist Party's Organ Newspapers</p>
<p>Guoshi Bao    Yangcheng Daily    Qishi'er Hang (Seventy-Two Trades)</p>

<p>Xinmin Congbao</p>
<p>Start Reporting and Read It with Pleasure. After the death of Emperor Guangxu, Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao lost their protectors, and their party members scattered like birds and beasts.</p>
<p>During the Tongmenghui period, according to the "Draft History of the Chinese Kuomintang," in the Nanyang region, there were also the "Tunan Bao" in Singapore, the "Guanghua Bao" in Rangoon, the "Myanmar Bao" in Burma, the "Xingzhou Chenbao," "Nangiao Ribao" in Singapore, the "Qiaosheng Bao" in Kuala Lumpur, and the "Jiaomin Bao" in Siam, which were quite influential in their propaganda efforts.</p>
<p>Yu Youren (at that time only known by his alias Bo Xun) was wanted by Qing officials for his writings, so he went from Shaanxi to Shanghai. He first took charge of the "Shenzhou Bao," and after the establishment of the Tongmenghui, he also ran the "Min Hu Ribao" (People's Cry Daily). Because of his radical views, it was also banned. He then founded the "Min Li Bao" (People's Stand Daily), promoting the revolution even more vigorously. At that time, Song Jiaoren, using the pseudonym "Fisherman," published articles that were brilliant and compelling, and readers mostly admired them. The writers in its supplement were all well-known figures, such as Fisherman, Chu Cang, and Sao Xin, who used their eloquent pens to express their concern for the country. Yu's comrades, such as Yang Shouren, Zhang Rong, and Wu Yue, were all outstanding talents of their time. Outsiders mostly regarded the "Min Li Bao" in Shanghai as the party headquarters of the revolutionary party, and there was a reason for that. Other newspapers, such as the "Tianmin Bao," "Qimin Bao," and "Pingmin Bao" in Guangzhou, also had a considerable readership. Furthermore, newspapers such as the "Guomin Bao" in Beijing and the "Dagong Bao" in Tianjin devoted even more efforts during the Tongmenghui era.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Visit to the Divine Soldiers in the Gaoligong Mountains (4) <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Jiefeng</p>
<p>(Originally published in the Yomiuri Hochi on December 6)</p>
<p>Sent by the Army Press Department of the General Headquarters, Yomiuri Hochi reporter, Yasushi Sano (sent from a certain place on the Sino-Burmese border)</p>
<p>The next day at 7:30, in the dimness of dawn, we set off for the front line. Because we had entered Chinese territory, fearing the appearance of plainclothes squads, the unit specially used a large passenger car, and also sent three soldiers to escort me. From Mangshi to the front line, it was all valleys on the left and right, and the Burma Road stretched out like a snake. The wreckage of enemy tanks, cargo trucks overturned with working machinery, and many lime buckets... Seeing these, a picture of the enemy scrambling to escape appeared before my eyes. The car was driving in the clouds, and soon we entered the streets of Longling. To the left of the street entrance, cargo trucks, small trucks, new tires, were piled up together. The Burma Road beyond Longling was still under construction. Gravel, asphalt, barrels, etc. along both sides of the road illustrated this fact. About thirty kilometers out of Longling, near a village called Mengchang Street, I saw a small and exquisite house. When I stopped the car to look, it turned out to be a hot spring. At the entrance, on a board, were carved the four characters "Egret Hot Spring." In the courtyard, there were rockeries, springs, pines, and cypresses. The bath was made of concrete and was an excellent hot spring field equipped with a steam bath. The water in the field was sulfurous spring water, used specifically for healing. But next to it, there were also baths for the residents to use. On the front line, resources, labor, and technology were lacking, but overcoming these shortcomings, the soldiers were still diligently building. Fortifications, barracks, roads, bridges are not to be mentioned, even hot spring fields for the residents were built. This stubborn construction power of the soldiers is truly amazing. In the trenches overlooking the enemy's position across the Nu River, I learned from these divine soldiers from Takamagahara many "lessons" that people in the rear must learn. (The End)</p>
