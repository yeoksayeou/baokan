<p>關於將領在體力上應具的特質，我也想略爲一提，這不外乎膽勇，健康，和朝氣。至於他的外貌，我們倒毋庸計較；八面威風的儀容固然再好沒有，但良將和駿馬一樣，必能「在任何姿態中疾馳」。血氣之勇，對於將官的陞遷現在已非主要因素，確和短兵相接的舊時代大相逕庭；不過在戰事進行中還是靠着勇氣來決定一個司令官所敢冒險的程度，所以依舊佔着極重要的地位；而且在機械化戰爭中，我們又可以看見將官在近前綫的地方督師，往往身先士卒，甚或親自升空偵察並發號施令呢！</p>
<p>要知道舊時代戰爭中將官們所受到的砲火如何猛烈，這裏是一個例子，在白雷哈姆戰役中，馬爾巴羅進攻舒倫堡的結果，聯軍陣亡中將六員，受傷者五員，英軍共傷亡一千五百人，內有少將四員，副少將及中校廿八員。還有一個故事講到拿破侖手下的一員虎將，就是但澤公爵勒非勃。據說，公爵有一個作文官的朋友，看着他的壯麗宅第及其他因戰功所獲得的助獎，屢次表示羨妒，老將軍聽了生厭，就對他道：「假使你要這些東西，跟我到花園裏去，讓我在相隔四十步的距離對你開十槍，假使你倖得不死，我就把這所房子和裏面的東西統統給你」。他的朋友當然不允許這麼辦。於是老將軍道：「這就作罷。不過你要知道，我在未曾得到這些東西之前，身臨火錢，會經有幾百顆子彈在那樣近的距離向我飛來啊」！</p>
<p>一個將領必須兼有肉體上和道德上的勇氣，實已毋庸置疑。福祿特耳嘗稱　馬爾巴羅道，他「在戎馬倥偬中顯出鎭定的勇氣，在生死關頭上謐靜如恒，這正是將兵者最好的天賦」。還有一個近代的軍事著作家，他雖則不很崇拜霞飛，但是也不得不讚許霞飛木强的鎭靜和堅定的決心，當年在絕望的總撤退時期中就靠這種工夫來抵袖他在戰略上所鑄成的幾個大錯。將領的健康自然也是頂重要的條件，不過這條件僅是相對的。譬如眼前有一個患病的拿破崙和他的幾個敵人，我想我們一定都願意拿破崙加入我們的一邊，而決不要他的敵人。由烏爾弗等人所顯示的榜樣，可知脆弱的身體也能蘊著一種偉大精神。當馬爾巴羅從事幾次偉大戰役的時候，假使讓現代的醫藥衛生部去檢查其體格，多半會請他免役的罷。</p>
<p>其次，講到將領的年齡又是一個聚訟粉紜的問題。古時有一個羅馬詩人已經說過，老年人在戰爭和戀愛中皆無令譽。但是究竟過了什麼年紀一個將領才不爲敵人所威懼，一個風流才子不受異性的歡迎，實不易確定。以漢尼拔，亞歷山大，拿破崙，威靈頓，烏爾弗等名將而論，可以說戰爭的最高榮譽應歸諸靑年人。反之’則又見愷撒和克倫威爾過了四十歲才開始重大的征戰，馬爾巴羅在六十一　時攻破了號稱「不可逾越」的防綫，爲共一生最受稱譽的戰役；屠棱在六十三歲時打完最後一仗，據說是生平最勇最佳之一役；據近代軍人牛耳的毛奇六十六歲剛才出名，七十歲始李盛譽，羅伯次六十七歲到非洲去圖雪英軍敗衂之恥，卒在帕得堡圍困波耳軍，並奪獲布隆方丹與比勒陀利亞；福煦在六十七歲時猶精力彌滿，富有創意。</p>
<p>我們雖拿從前的將領來作比較，須知今日之軍人成器較晚；例如威靈頓，烏爾弗，穆爾，克牢福脫等十五歲左右即已服役，且有的入伍不久便經歷戰事。靑年的熱熾勇敢與年事較長後的明斷多識，實難確切估價以分軒輊；假使成熟的心志猶能理解新觀念而吸收之，猶能忍受意外的打聽，猶敢實施大膽而反常的計劃，則其豐富的學識與判斷力確勝靑年一篓。但無疑的，一個年靑的良將往往可以擊敗一個年老的良將；最近英軍將官年齡限制的減低，從另優勢早失良材，實為恰當的舉動。德性我想母庸絮絮詳說。無論何人，不問其學識如何淵博，非有領袖的天賦決不能成爲領袖的。領袖的特性諒諸君也知之已諗，在第二講中我還要提到，現在只舉最根本的幾個要素來說一說　一個領袖必須具有個性－，這就是說旣能洞悉目的所在，且有不達不休的勇氣和決心；又應摯懷人道通達世情，這是領袖立身行事之本，而最重要的是必須具備戰鬥的精神，必勝的意志。這種精神我們在運動場上時常看到，譬如必比賽失敗的一面能盡心竭力的繼續賽下去，明明已經失敗的竟能恢復力量轉敗爲勝，有的雖已敗了而始終不肯認敗。但是一個眞正偉大的軍事領袖所以和尋常的將官不同，我以爲還有一點德性上的區別，就是前者必完具有一種冒險精神，像賭棍一樣的冒險精神。拿破崙道：「爲戰爭藝術僅以不冒險爲盡能事，則一切榮譽皆歸庸夫矣。」所以他講到一位將官，動亂間其是否「倖運」。他的意思就是問是否大膽的」。將領可獲倖運，無膽的決不能獲得倖運。甘心被各種條規重重束縛的將領極難有打一次勝仗的希望。這種指揮官會得到怎樣的結果呢？讓我援引海軍史上的一個例子，來做一示警垂訓的故事」。</p>
<p>大約在距今一百七十五年之前，有一個小心翼翼而才能似乎平庸的海軍大將在後甲板上往來蹀跳，一面和旗艦艦長切切議事。原來此時正有一隊敵　駛過，近在襲擊距離之內，而道位大將還在研究其進攻的配置是否與海軍部最近頒下的冗長訓　密相合。但是等到艦長的答覆已能使其滿意，敵艋也已逃之夭夭了。大將回國后坐是受軍法裁判而遭槍決，以懲傚尤。假使後人因此次敎訓的鼓勵，果能在必要時棄條規如敝屣，那麽這位倒霉的而大將也算不曾白死了。其實只在承平的時候，條規和例行公事才覺得重要，大膽和獨創的見解也須加以阻遏。不過我們看英國的許多名將，如克倫威爾　　葡巴羅，威　　及其手下的格　姆，喜爾和克牢福脫，在承平中服役的期間都極短促。</p>
<p>以上所說，都是關於將領在體力上和德行上的問題，現在接下去講智力上的特性。共最重要的就是所謂常識，申言之，就是能明辨何者可能何者不可能的知識。常識的基礎必須築在「戰爭機構」的健全學上，即地形學，行軍學，和軍需學。軍事學識的眞正基礎也就是這些，並非戰略戰術，如　一般人所設想的。那班業餘戰略家之所以失算就因爲不懂得軍隊進退管理上的理論與實踐，也就是有些人所說的「行軍兵站學」。至於戰略原理，只要稍明事理的人便能够在短時期間學會的。可否讓我舉一個極廣淺的例子？一個計劃消度假期的人可以因自己的決定或別人的意見，準備往埃及一游。道是極易定奪的；但是進一步他就得計算到埃及去的旅程旅費，須分別和假期的長短錢袋的豐吝來比較一下。這才是一步困難的工作，說一個政治上的例子，譬如有許多失業的人，又有一件工作，令失業的人去做那件工作，誰都想得到，但是在實行的時候，要顧到行動，居室，經濟等等問題，却又成難事了。</p>
<p>不幸大多數的軍事學專藉，因爲太重視戰略戰術的緣故，反忽略了管理部署上的事務，例如，白雷哈姆戰役如何獲勝，軍事學者莫不知之，但是能知未戰之前如何作種種部署進備，才得一戰而捷，則十不得一，阿楞比的第三次迦薩戰役事先會費了幾個月的部署籌　，始獲成功。一七一一年突破「不可逾越」防线，難為馬爾巴羅最受人稱譽的戰略，共實即小孩子都想做得到，不過能够竟其全功的恐怕除了馬爾巴羅外更無第二人。一九〇〇年，羅伯次的帕得堡之役，一九一七年阿楞比的迦薩別是巴之役都應用上述馬爾巴羅極簡單的戰略而加以變化罷了；但實施起來又必需極其靈活謹愼的部署了。所以當需君研究戰史的時候，應牢記管理部署方面的事務是一個重要因素，因爲一般批評家和許多將領的錯誤都在這方面啊。</p>

<p>春秋何不食苞米？  之滄　　目前的食糧問題，眞是我輩小市民心頭上的一個苦結，幾時輕鬆一二呢，甚至可以完美解決呢？不免三太息，我欲問蒼天，蒼天莫能答。　　但「天無絕人之路」，似有明訓，雖嘆生不逢辰，但為應付現實起見，不得不硬起頭皮做一天和尙撞一天鐘，撞得淸脆響亮，嘶啞黯淡則在所不計，這未嘗不是一個辦法，可以聊為解嘲。　　工部局日來勸吿市民兼食苞米，不勝胞與之至。誠然，中國有史以來，人民即以米為主要給養，尤其在南方是如此。但現在呢，對於米以下的糧食都要問津。嘗聞諸父老云：「飯為根本肉為標」，但他們目前連吃麵都似奇貨可居，不像從前米到過三十塊時硬咬麵疙瘩腹中似有痞塊而表示「遺憾」，因為麵粉也實在少，連生煎饅頭也有「才難」之嘆。　　米羅一斗時，趨之若狂，頗嫌不够；至三升時，則不足一家六口之糧，因之米店前眞有萬馬奔騰，人山人海之勢；現在到了一升，則又如何？這都是事實。　　因之「飯為根本肉為標」的俗語，必將不攻自破。晋惠帝云：「何不食肉糜」，雖有煞風景之感，在營養方面講，自然是顛撲不破的眞理。　　「何不食西點？」這是笑話。「何不食白脫麵包？」市上畢竟缺如。「何不食黃豆？何不食赤豆？」事實上黃豆也比米貴，一試便知在下之言非虛。　　然而苞米的確比較便宜，當局勸吿食用，言之諄諄，確有必要。苞米在營養上講雖不及肉糜，却視白米無有不及。　　凡經過時間所淘汰下來的俗語，决將現其眞正的價值。「飯為根本肉為標」，自然不足以慰我望。在必要之時，飯的代用品將有許許多多，何必貪茲口腹，而陷於不能應付的窮境。　　希望苞米長留，而且不能漲價上去。拋磚引肉  留申　　大概是小康人家年貨辦得過賸，把一大塊鹹肉憑空懸在沿馬路牆壁上，害得沒處吃年夜飯的馬路英雄饞涎欲滴，無不思得之而甘心，乃籌得一法，以麻繩縛磚，於夜深人靜時向肉遙擲，居然一擊而中，肉隨磚下，肉主人竟因「懷璧其罪」，以致將年貨拱手讓人。生活決定意識  林峯　　同事張君：穿着馬褲呢大衣在排隊買米，被另一個同事小李瞧見了，一進辦公空就像報吿緊急新聞那樣報告大家：　　「哈哈！我早上來，在路上看見老張穿着馬褲呢大衣，戴着呢帽，軋在老太婆女人當中買米，哈哈！他還向我點點頭；我看了眞難為情。」　　有人報以歡笑，有人報以白眼。　　王先生放下報紙說：一這有什麽難為情，出錢買米，不是偷，又不是搶，你是小開，家里有十包二十包米存着，但是一個人有旦夕禍福呵，明天倒起霉來，怕你不去軋着隊買米！怕你不去掃垃圾米吃！」　　「談也不要談起，這倆情願餓死，眞不高興去軋米：」小李橫着嘴說。　　「噓……」這兩句話引起了大家普遍的反感。　　一我知道的，老張有一個母親已經六十幾歲了，妻子有了孕，將要分娩；一個女孩子祇有五歲，除了他自己，還有誰可以幫他去買米呢」！方胖子這樣說。　　「唔，老張的境况是很可憐的。」王先生說着，拿起了報紙。「但是偏偏有人把別人家的痛苦當作笑料，其實它本身就是一種笑料！」大家都叫他「哲學大家」小毛的不平之鳴。　　這時候老張進來了，大家的目光都不約而同地集中了他，他默默地脫下帽子，大衣上的粉筆字還隱然可見。　　「老張，你洋粉袋有多嗎？明天我幫你去軋米。」方胖子說。　　「好，謝謝你！」　　這時候，小毛揭下一張日曆，拿起鋼筆在上面寫了：　　「生活决定了人生的意識舞臺与銀幕　　薜玲仙潦倒已久，忽於去年年底返嚴宅，而壽終正變矣。最早在玫瑰團時代，與陳敬如同享盛名；後與白虹胡笳等分庭抗禮，終因染惡嗜好而不能自拔，嗚呼！　　上官雲珠去靑島，致卡爾登「楊貴妃」中的梅妃「脫班」，現由了芝任之。　　陸露明在紅實演「大地回春」（按：即「這不過是春天」），據聞酬金為一千元。　　王獻齋死後，他母親竟亦在年前逝世，袁竹如王薇母女倆，內心悲傷可知。　　唐若靑「牽記」的孫景璐，巳與華年解約，「地獄天使」女主角迄今尙在物色中。　　李綺年脫離藝華後，有入國華訊，確否待證。　　王次龍之死，本刋首先登載，有王元龍致張善琨的雷報為證。  太虛　　李綺年在藝華任事頗久，賓主尙無不合。最近李忽與該公司主人嚴春堂發生裂痕，突控嚴積欠其薪金及風流寡婦片酬金共達四萬七千元及妨害自由背信等，經月初一度傳訊，聞日內尙將再行研訊云·  社聞社　　俄國歌舞團，為國際著名藝人所組合，擁有男女演員五十人，樂師二十六人，聞此一組織將於三月六日在大光明戲院登台表演，其中節目甚多，而尤以沙洛爾斯基及尼亞石夫指導之但丁名著「詩人遊地獄」，及「伊戈王子」最為偉大富麗，此外並將表演中國舞。聞座價最低二元最高六元，日內即將開始售票云。　　中華口琴會定三月一日上午十時假座愛多亞路光華大戲院舉行十二週紀念音樂大會，節目有玩具交響曲，未完成交響曲，邀舞，海盜序曲，菲格羅結婚序曲等，由王慶隆氏領導，該會口琴隊百餘人登臺演奏。風雨同舟  何家支　　㈠　風雨之夕　　坐在維城對面的，是一個穿翠綠色雨衣的女子，維城在愁着自己沒有帶得雨具，一共不曾注意到她是什麽地點什麼時候上的車。偶然一抬頭，對而已有了道個女子。她的雨衣，和燈罩式的雨帽上，全潮了，雨衣的前襟，還沾了一大片泥漿，她不住撩着衣襟來看，又攢聚着兩條彎彎的細細的小眉峰，知道她是在惋惜。她在車廂裹，似乎是一隻鳳凰在雞窠裹，車上的人，都忙裹偷閑的看着她，維城便扭過臉去不看。這須不是維城的嫉妬，他想：一個年靑女子，經過許多目光注視着她，是會害臊的，他宅心仁厚，不忍去看人家害臊。　　電車到了五馬路外灘，維城把一件西裝厚呢大衣的領子監起了，一手掖著衣領，一手撩舖的二路電車，因為是中途上車，所以連坐位也沒有。他只能在蔽不得風雨的月台上站立。他憧憬着穿翠綠色雨衣的女子，把剛才所要看的窗外景色忽略了。車到十六舖，又換坐了往高昌廟的電車，中間經過董家渡站。董家渡，是他要到達的第一目的地。　　董家渡是一個船碼頭，黃浦江裹，排列着許多形形色色的船隻。在這裹，堅着烟囱的小輪船，巳是村中無虎犬為王；共餘全是些民船：像舢板，擺渡船，夜航船，馬頭船，無錫快，都是。在風雨交加的暮色中，維城下了車，站在扶梯式的碼頭上，舉手遮住帽蒼，遠遠的瞭望到黃浦江裹。他要尋覓一隻揷着紅旗子的船。雨中走過一個撑了油紙傘的老者，問道：「是葉少爺嗎？」維城回頭一看，見他花白的短鬍子和裝了密密的鈕扣而從來不扣的短襖，便知道他是船家張樹榮。道可使他有了一些笑意，問道：「我正要找你，你的船呢？怎麼不揷紅旗子了？一張樹榮笑道：「雨下的大，雨繩子都從傘上掛下來。棄少爺，你上一枝春茶館喝一盌茶，再下船不遲，張樹榮陪了你說話。」他說時，把那油紙傘遞了過來。（二）遊藝雜談骰子  澤大　　現今博戲之中，以骰子應用為最廣，蓋取此以定次序，決先後；而骰子本身之為戲，名目甚多，暇當分別叙述，茲備考其來源。按古時大博有箸，小博有瓊，此箸與瓊，後變五木，至唐又變為骰子。骰本作投，取投擲於盤筵之義。或作頭字，言其骨頭所成。又作骰字，則取骨製而可投擲者也。然骰即古之股字，不音投，故實借用，非其原義。此種骰子，舊傳為魏曹植所製，實非，乃由五木轉變而來。蓋五木兩頭尖銳，骰子乃裁尖為方；五木但有黑白兩面，骰子則因方而分六面。此六面各者一數，兩顆相合，最多為十二點，所以應十二月也。至飾四以朱者，相傳始於唐玄宗，如唐潘遠西墅記談云：「玄宗與貴妃采戰，將北，唯重四可轉敗為勝。上擲而連呼叱之，骰子宛轉，良久而成重四。上大悅，命將軍高力士賜四緋。」故今以四二為至尊，反較十二點為大者，即由玄宗一時戲言所致也。如何從事修養  流之　　沒有作業計劃的人固然糊裏糊塗，飽食終日，無所用心，有上一大串作業計劃而不付之實踐的人，也祗有嘆氣的份兒，甚至逢茲良辰佳節，會觸目驚心，精神疲乏；有計劃而做到的人，在休息的時候，最為舒適；一想到工作的成績，三萬六千根毛孔裹都長出了一個愉快來。　　孟子說得好：「……人恒過，然後能改，困於心，衡於慮，而後作……然後知生於憂患而死於安樂也。」這是最通的眞理，我們要心中安泰，事業成功，非要理會一切自身的矛盾不可；而理會則必須修養。　　陶侃在歷史上終算赫赫有名的了；為政如諸葛孔明，行軍如曹孟德；但他有時非得做做泥水匠不可。這「運甓」的道理，就是現在小學生也都會侃侃而談。此無他，世界上決沒有一個懶惰的諸葛孔明和一個懶惰的曹孟德。　　陶淵明有詩云：「雖有五男兒，終不好紙筆……阿舒已二八，懶惰故無匹……天運苟如此，且進杯中物」！老人的敎訓，頗言之痛心；然而他的頹廢，也為世人所詬病。但你也別看輕了他，他雖沒有光祖陶侃的功業，在田野中却是努力過來了的。他種田，才有收成。「採菊東籬下，悠然見南山一正是他體會了自然環境以後的愉快表現。一石米  星雲　　現在要買一石米：必須往返一百次！必須在寒風中鵠立（百餘小時！　　（附註：「跑空趟」不計內）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Sea Battle in the Lombok Strait; Japanese Troops Land on Bali; Java Threatened on Three Sides; Allied Forces Retreat from Sumatra <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Domei News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:15 PM today that two Japanese destroyers engaged two Dutch East Indies cruisers and three destroyers in the Lombok Strait between Bali and Lombok Islands yesterday at midnight. They sank two destroyers and heavily damaged another. The Japanese destroyers pursued the Dutch cruisers for three hours. Subsequently, two more Japanese destroyers arrived to assist and attacked the enemy cruisers with torpedoes.</p>
<p>Batavia, 21st (Havas News Agency) – Official sources have announced that Japanese troops are continuing to land on Bali Island despite fierce resistance from the defending forces. Bali Island is separated from Java by only a narrow strait, about one mile wide. It has a population of 1.2 million, of whom only 400 are Caucasians.</p>
<p>Batavia, 20th (Havas News Agency) – Official sources announced that tensions have risen here since the Japanese invasion of Bali Island. The island is east of Java and is strategically important. If the Japanese occupy the island, Java will be threatened on three sides. In other words, the Japanese will be able to attack Java from Borneo in the north, Sumatra in the west, and Bali Island in the east.</p>
<p>Batavia, 21st (Reuters) – The battle for Bali Island continued last night and today, and it is undoubtedly a large-scale operation. The battle for Bali is the first round in the struggle for Surabaya and eastern Java. This is well understood here. The waters around Bali are turbulent with strong currents, large waves, and many coral reefs, and sharks are present. Only shallow-draft vessels can approach the shore, so the Japanese landing forces must transfer to smaller boats far from the coast. Because of the reefs, it is difficult for Allied submarines to operate there. Panarukan, on the eastern coast of Java, just one and a half miles from Bali Island, was bombed by Japanese planes today. However, there is no indication that Japanese troops will advance towards Batavia or western Java. According to today's Dutch East Indies Army communiqué, Japanese planes scouted northern Sumatra, and one airfield each in western and eastern Java were attacked and slightly damaged.</p>
<p>Batavia Harbor, 21st (Havas News Agency) – It has been learned that Allied forces have begun to retreat from Sumatra. Ten ships have arrived at Merak, Java, to evacuate troops.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Domei News Agency) – It is reported that Japanese troops landed yesterday at two locations on the Dutch-owned Bintan Island, 45 kilometers southeast of Shonan (Singapore), and occupied them without resistance. The island is known for its rich bauxite and tin deposits.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Domei News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced today: Japanese naval aircraft heavily bombed Surabaya on the 18th of this month, shooting down 13 American aircraft and severely damaging five destroyers. Two Japanese aircraft were lost. Japanese naval aircraft attacked Kupang, the capital of Dutch Timor Island, on the 17th of this month, destroying 20 buildings, including barracks and forts, and sinking a 3,000-ton merchant ship. Japanese naval units fought in the waters off Sumatra on the 17th and 18th of this month, sinking one enemy ship, capturing one British submarine destroyer, one minesweeper, and one British and one Dutch merchant ship. Japanese army aircraft bombed the Karijati airfield, 100 kilometers east of Batavia, yesterday, destroying or damaging a total of 27 enemy aircraft.</p>

<p>Washington, 20th (Havas News Agency) – According to an Army Department announcement, full-scale war has broken out on the Bataan Peninsula in the Philippines. Japanese artillery has heavily bombarded American supply lines.</p>
<p>Washington, 20th (Reuters) – The War Department announced yesterday that there are positional battles on all fronts of the Bataan Peninsula in the Philippines. Japanese planes dropped many incendiary bombs behind our lines. 60,000 workers at the U.S. Army arsenal sent a telegram to General MacArthur, commander of the U.S.-Philippine Allied Forces in the Philippines, expressing their respects. General MacArthur has replied with a telegram of thanks.</p>

<p>Canberra, 21st (Havas News Agency) – Following repeated Japanese air raids on Darwin, official sources have declared martial law and ordered all non-essential residents to evacuate. Nurses will be the only women allowed to remain. Local overseas Chinese had already evacuated. According to eyewitnesses, the third Japanese air raid on Darwin was the most intense. Japanese planes flew over the area from the south about six or seven times, with nine planes in each wave. There were only two minutes between the air raid warning and the first bombs landing and exploding. Japanese planes attacked every three minutes.</p>

<p>Canberra, 21st (Havas News Agency) – Australian Prime Minister Curtin returned here the other day from Sydney to attend a special cabinet meeting to discuss the Japanese bombing of Darwin. He attended a secret parliamentary meeting today to make a report. The public session of parliament has been postponed until the 25th of this month. According to his remarks, the extent of the damage caused by the Japanese bombing of Darwin will not be released, but he acknowledged that several ships anchored in the harbor were damaged.</p>
<p>Sydney, 21st (Havas News Agency) – Former Australian Prime Minister Menzies gave a radio address yesterday, urging women across the country to take over men's jobs so that more men can join the military.</p>
<p>Saigon, 21st (Haitong News Agency) – A dispatch from Wellington states that the Japanese attack on Darwin has made New Zealand feel uneasy. New Zealand and Australia are in negotiations to combine their air forces. The New Zealand government has ordered that female factory workers may not marry without the permission of the factory.</p>

<p>Sydney, 21st (Reuters) – It is reported that overseas Chinese women and children evacuated from New Guinea and other islands in the Southwest Pacific are now settled in a refugee camp outside Sydney. The camp was provided by the New South Wales Overseas Chinese Evacuation Committee (chaired by the Chinese Consul General) for overseas Chinese women and children to live in. It is equipped with bowls, chopsticks, and other utensils. Overseas Chinese doctors are volunteering to provide free medical treatment for them.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Palembang Oil Wells Completely Destroyed; Large Stockpiles of Oil Consumed by Fire <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>San Francisco, 20th (Special Dispatch) – Mr. Pirie, an employee of the Standard Vacuum Oil Company in Palembang, Sumatra, broadcasted "Eyewitness Account of the Great Fire in Palembang" from Batavia to the United States yesterday, stating that the first Japanese paratroopers landed near the Standard Vacuum Oil Company refinery in Palembang at 9:30 AM on the 15th. The Standard Vacuum Oil Company began evacuating its employees at noon, while some experts prepared to completely destroy all machinery. At 2:00 AM the next morning, electricity was used to detonate five bombs simultaneously. With a deafening roar, millions of barrels of oil stored in the entire plant were consumed by fire. The 80-mile long pipelines and oil wells were then destroyed, with explosives placed every few hundred feet so that the entire 81-mile pipeline was destroyed simultaneously upon detonation. The methods used to prevent oil from flowing out of the oil wells during the destruction cannot be announced at this time. Some sources say that it will take several years of repairs before the Palembang oil wells can resume production, and several months of restoration will not be enough. A Batavia newspaper reported that the fire in Palembang was unprecedented in history. The fire was so intense that it caused a sudden change in the weather. The fire was followed by a major storm.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 21st (Domei News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced this afternoon that in the Singapore campaign, Japanese forces captured 73,000 British soldiers, including Lieutenant General Percival, the British commander in Singapore. 8,000 were injured. In addition, the spoils of war included 3,000 cannons of various types, 2,000 machine guns, 50,000 rifles, 200 tanks and armored vehicles, 10,000 automobiles, 200 motorcycles, one 10,000-ton ship, three 5,000-ton oil tankers, and countless other military expenses. The Japanese suffered approximately 1,000 casualties in this campaign.</p>

<h3 id="e9">The World Closely Watches the Political Developments in Britain; Cripps Broadcasts to the Nation Urging Increased Wartime Industrial Production <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>London, 20th (Havas News Agency) – The newly appointed Lord Privy Seal, Sir Stafford Cripps, delivered a radio address to the nation today, emphasizing the need to increase wartime production. He stated that at this point, all factories in the Soviet Union are completely on a war footing, without exception. "Every worker is prepared to die for their country and sacrifice for the success of their people." Although Britain has lost its naval superiority in the Southwest Pacific, he believes that ultimate victory will belong to us.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Havas News Agency) – A semi-official German commentary on the British political situation stated that British Prime Minister Churchill would rather reorganize his cabinet than submit a vote of confidence to Parliament again. Furthermore, Churchill was willing to sacrifice his close confidant, Lord Beaverbrook, and recruit his "personal political enemy," Stafford Cripps, into the cabinet. He knows that Cripps is a close friend of Stalin and a person who carries out Communist orders within Britain. The reason he still believes that it is a good move to invite Cripps to serve as Leader of the House of Commons is because he believes that Cripps, after taking office, can respond to the attacks from the opposition in Parliament at any time. Churchill's intention is to turn the person who has criticized the government most fiercely in the past into the government's greatest supporter. Whether this strategy will succeed can be answered by past experience. In short, the cabinet reshuffle will not eliminate the difficulties Churchill is facing. At the same time, the public will still demand answers from the government regarding the recent political and military failures. In any case, Germany is closely watching how the British political situation will develop in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Fierce Fighting in Northern and Eastern Henan <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing, 21st – Chongqing newspapers expressed their satisfaction with the British cabinet reshuffle. The Ta Kung Pao commented that Britain's greatest crisis was at the time of France's defeat. The current situation is far from what it used to be. Britain overcame the crisis at that time with a spirit of struggle and perseverance and eliminated the doubts about the capacity of the democratic system. With the institution being strengthened by this cabinet reshuffle, the domestic reforms and the foreign struggles will begin with renewed momentum. Because Churchill is decisive and intelligent, he accepted public opinion and removed those less capable members from the cabinet, and he brought in those who are more popular and capable. This is no different from injecting new blood into the wartime government. Politics will progress, and combat power will be strengthened. The war situation will change. The entry of the Labor Party's radical Stafford Cripps into the cabinet will make Britain and India more cooperative because Cripps has always advocated that Britain's friends in the Middle East are the people of India. In short, the anti-aggression front will be strengthened by the continuous struggle resulting from the British cabinet reshuffle. The Central Daily News said that this British cabinet reshuffle can only be regarded as the beginning of designing new policies and reviewing new strategies. The entry of Cripps can strengthen British cooperation with China, the Soviet Union, and India because Cripps is a strong advocate for Britain to have concrete connections with the three major nations of China, the Soviet Union, and India. Churchill accepted Cripps’s political views when he brought him into the cabinet. From now on, British foreign policy will have new developments, and there will be new decisions on the attitude toward India. Not only will this make the British Empire a unified and strong combat group, but the allies will also benefit from it. It goes without saying that the morale of the British people will be boosted because of this. The Saodang Pao commented that in this British cabinet reshuffle, Prime Minister Churchill concurrently serving as Minister of Defense can be regarded as the coordination of British political and military strategy, which means strengthening the British fighting spirit and implementing an active offensive. The assumption of new positions by Attlee and Cripps will help Churchill get along with India and complete the mission of mobilizing India. The disharmonious atmosphere in the government will also be eliminated by Cripps serving as Leader of the House of Commons, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="e14">Former French Prime Minister Demands Investigation into Responsibility for Defeat; Military Leaders Should Be Responsible for Strategic and Tactical Errors <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Lyon, France, 20th (Havas News Agency) – The Supreme Court in Lyon held its second hearing today on the case of those accused of leading the country astray. The attorney for former Prime Minister Daladier, Mr. Lebet, spoke, requesting the Supreme Court to investigate all responsibilities before 1936 and after France's entry into the war on September 4, 1939. He emphasized that it is necessary to conduct a military investigation into France's defeat, stating that "Our country's defeat was due to strategic and tactical errors. The demoralized spirit of our country's military leaders was also one of the reasons for the defeat because France had a strong army and unparalleled perfect equipment, as admitted by General Weygand, the former commander-in-chief of the National Defense Army. The Supreme Court should conduct another investigation to determine the responsibilities of those in command of the military. The real purpose of this trial was to try those who should be held responsible for the current European War and France's defeat, but at this point, it has changed its original intention and instead is trying those responsible for France's failure to prepare for war. Daladier's crimes are considered that he should be responsible for the current war and that he must answer for the French army's failure to be fully prepared, which is logically inconsistent." At this point, the president of the Supreme Court, Mr. Jaouss, warned Attorney Lebet that he should defend the court and not appeal to sentiments. Attorney Lebet then continued to speak, saying, "The military expenditures in 1934 and 1935 were not fully utilized. It was not until Daladier became Minister of the Army that huge sums of money were allocated for military expenditures and that he sought to have the parliament pass a bill to reorganize the armed forces. Initially, the total cost was 140 billion francs, which was later increased to 600 billion francs. It can be seen from this that Daladier had long wanted to reorganize the armed forces." Attorney Spanial, the attorney for former Prime Minister Blum, continued to speak, saying, "I absolutely agree with the speech given by Attorney Lebet because Blum was not in a key position at the beginning of the outbreak of the European War. Therefore, the Supreme Court is trying the political leaders for the crime of dereliction of duty, and Blum is not included. Who should bear this responsibility? The court should investigate." After finishing speaking, Blum himself spoke, saying, "The stage of transitioning from a state of peace to a state of war is the question that needs to be studied now. This stage did not occur before the Munich Agreement because at that time, maintaining peace can be fully proven. Therefore, the investigation of responsibility should begin in 1938, and if it is to be discussed from a political perspective, it should begin in 1939. The real crisis of the war began when the National Socialist Party came to power in 1933. France announced the end of its disarmament policy in 1934. What was the state of the country's military equipment when we came to power in 1936? Those who despised aviation and motorization equipment and only relied on static positional warfare were responsible for the defeat. Why don't you order these military leaders to come to court to confront us? You criticize the organization of the 'Popular Front,' but you must know that since 1934, there has been a conspiracy against the republic in France. Tauriot and Bechelet and others have acted arbitrarily and conspired to undermine national unity, which is why the Popular Front was formed. Therefore, these two people should also come to court to confront us." Finally, Prosecutor General Gassanou rose to speak, stating that insufficient military equipment and inadequate preparation were the main reasons for France's defeat. "We must know that only a few people are being questioned in court today. There are still many people who share responsibility for the defeat. We will prosecute the current and former ministers in accordance with the provisions of the law, but not the generals. It is a well-known rule that the generals who command the entire army must surrender themselves. Even if we investigate military figures who are liable, it will not add anything to today's trial. The reason why we must start the investigation from 1936 is that, according to what Daladier said in 1939, the crisis in Germany had become absolutely clear at that time because March 7, 1936, was the day the German army entered the Rhineland." After finishing speaking, Blum's defense attorney requested the court to show some case files concerning his client's opposition to communist propaganda. The court then adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e24">On the Qualities of a General, by Wavell (Part 3) <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the physical attributes that a general should possess, I would also like to briefly mention that these are nothing more than courage, health, and vitality. As for his appearance, we need not dwell on that; a commanding presence is certainly desirable, but a good general, like a fine horse, must be able to "gallop in any posture." Physical bravery is no longer the primary factor in the promotion of officers, certainly a far cry from the old days of close combat; however, in the course of battle, the degree of risk a commander dares to take is still determined by courage, so it still occupies a very important position. Moreover, in mechanized warfare, we can again see generals supervising operations near the front lines, often taking the lead, even personally taking to the air to reconnoiter and issue commands!</p>
<p>To understand how intense the artillery fire was that generals faced in the old days of warfare, here is an example: in the Battle of Blenheim, Marlborough's attack on Schellenberg resulted in six lieutenant generals killed and five wounded in the Allied forces; the British suffered a total of 1,500 casualties, including four major generals, and 28 brigadier generals and lieutenant colonels. There is also a story about one of Napoleon's fierce generals, Marshal Lefebvre, Duke of Danzig. It is said that the Duke had a friend who was a civil official who, looking at his magnificent residence and other rewards he had obtained through military achievements, repeatedly expressed envy. The old general, tired of hearing this, said to him: "If you want these things, come with me to the garden and let me fire ten shots at you from a distance of forty paces. If you are lucky enough to survive, I will give you this house and everything in it." His friend, of course, would not allow such a thing. So the old general said: "Then forget about it. But you must know that before I got these things, I was in the line of fire, and hundreds of bullets flew at me from that close a distance!"</p>
<p>There is no doubt that a general must possess both physical and moral courage. Voltaire once said of Marlborough that he "displayed calm courage in the midst of the chaos of war, and remained as quiet as ever in the face of life and death, which is the best natural gift for a military commander." There is also a modern military writer who, although not a great admirer of Joffre, could not help but praise Joffre's stubborn calmness and firm determination, which he relied on during the desperate general retreat to offset several major strategic errors he had made. A general's health is naturally also a very important condition, but this condition is only relative. For example, if we have a sick Napoleon and several of his enemies before us, I think we would all prefer Napoleon to join our side and certainly not his enemies. The examples shown by Wolfe and others show that a fragile body can also contain a great spirit. When Marlborough was engaged in several great battles, if the modern department of medical and health were to examine his physique, they would most likely ask him to be exempt from service.</p>
<p>Next, when it comes to the age of a general, it is another contentious issue. An ancient Roman poet once said that old men have no reputation in war or in love. But it is difficult to determine at what age a general ceases to be feared by the enemy or a charming man ceases to be welcomed by the opposite sex. Judging by famous generals such as Hannibal, Alexander, Napoleon, Wellington, and Wolfe, it can be said that the highest honor of war should be attributed to young people. Conversely, we also see that Caesar and Cromwell did not begin their major campaigns until after the age of forty. Marlborough, at the age of sixty-one, broke through the so-called "impregnable" lines of defense, which was the most praised battle of his life; Turenne fought his last battle at the age of sixty-three, which is said to be one of the bravest and best of his life; Moltke, the leader of modern military personnel, did not become famous until he was sixty-six years old, and only began to enjoy great prestige at the age of seventy; Roberts went to Africa at the age of sixty-seven to avenge the shame of the British defeat, and finally besieged the Boer army in Paardeberg and captured Bloemfontein and Pretoria; Foch, at the age of sixty-seven, was still full of energy and creativity.</p>
<p>Although we use past generals for comparison, it should be known that today's soldiers mature later; for example, Wellington, Wolfe, Moore, Crawford, and others served at the age of fifteen or so, and some experienced battles soon after enlisting. It is difficult to accurately assess the heat and courage of youth and the clear judgment and extensive knowledge after a longer age to distinguish between the two; if a mature mind can still understand and absorb new ideas, can still endure unexpected setbacks, and still dares to implement bold and unconventional plans, then its rich knowledge and judgment are indeed superior to youth. But undoubtedly, a young good general can often defeat an old good general; the recent reduction in the age limit of British officers, to prevent the loss of talent, is indeed an appropriate move. As for virtue, I think there is no need to go into detail. No matter who it is, no matter how profound their knowledge, they can never become a leader without the natural gift of leadership. I think you all know the characteristics of a leader very well. I will mention it again in the second lecture. Now I will only mention a few of the most fundamental elements: a leader must have individuality - that is, he must be able to discern the purpose and have the courage and determination to achieve it; he should also be humane and understanding of the world, which is the foundation of a leader's conduct, and most importantly, he must possess the spirit of combat and the will to win. We often see this spirit on the sports field, for example, the side that is destined to lose can continue to compete with all its might, and those who have clearly failed can regain their strength and turn defeat into victory, and some, even though they have lost, will never admit defeat. But I think there is another difference in virtue that distinguishes a truly great military leader from an ordinary general, and that is that the former must possess a spirit of adventure, like the spirit of a gambler. Napoleon said: "If the art of war consists only in avoiding risks, then all honor belongs to mediocrities." So when he talked about a general, he asked whether he was "lucky." What he meant was whether he was bold. A general can be lucky, but the timid can never be lucky. A general who is content to be heavily bound by various rules and regulations has little hope of winning a battle. What will be the result of such a commander? Let me cite an example from naval history as a warning story."</p>
<p>About one hundred and seventy-five years ago, a cautious and seemingly mediocre admiral was pacing back and forth on the quarterdeck, discussing matters with the captain of the flagship. It turned out that an enemy fleet was passing by at this time, within striking distance, but the admiral was still studying whether the configuration of his attack was in line with the lengthy instructions recently issued by the Admiralty. But by the time the captain's reply had satisfied him, the enemy ships had already fled. The admiral was later court-martialed and shot for setting a bad example. If future generations, encouraged by this lesson, can indeed discard regulations when necessary, then this unlucky admiral will not have died in vain. In fact, only in times of peace do regulations and routines seem important, and bold and original ideas must be suppressed. But we see that many of Britain's famous generals, such as Cromwell, Marlborough, Wellington, and their subordinates Graham, Hill, and Crawford, served for very short periods during peacetime.</p>
<p>What has been said above is all about the physical and moral qualities of a general. Now let's move on to the intellectual characteristics. The most important thing is what is called common sense, in other words, the knowledge to distinguish what is possible and what is impossible. The foundation of common sense must be built on a sound understanding of the "war machine," namely topography, logistics, and supply. The true foundation of military knowledge is these, not strategy and tactics, as most people imagine. The reason why those amateur strategists miscalculate is because they do not understand the theory and practice of troop movement and management, which is what some people call "logistics." As for the principles of strategy, anyone with a little common sense can learn them in a short period of time. May I give a very broad example? A person who plans to spend a vacation can, based on their own decision or the opinions of others, prepare to travel to Egypt. That is very easy to decide; but further, they have to calculate the cost of the trip to Egypt, which must be compared with the length of the vacation and the size of their wallet. This is a difficult task. To give a political example, if there are many unemployed people and there is a job for the unemployed to do, everyone can think of it, but in practice, it is difficult to take into account the issues of action, housing, and economics.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most military textbooks, because they attach too much importance to strategy and tactics, neglect the affairs of management and deployment. For example, military scholars all know how the Battle of Blenheim was won, but few know how to make various deployments and preparations before the battle to win the battle. Allenby's Third Battle of Gaza took months of deployment and preparation to succeed. The breakthrough of the "impregnable" line of defense in 1711 is Marlborough's most praised strategy, which is actually something that even a child can think of, but I am afraid that no one but Marlborough can accomplish it. In 1900, Roberts' Battle of Paardeberg and Allenby's Battle of Gaza-Beersheba in 1917 both applied the above-mentioned very simple strategy of Marlborough and modified it; but its implementation requires extremely flexible and careful deployment. Therefore, when you study military history, you should keep in mind that the affairs of management and deployment are an important factor, because the mistakes of general critics and many generals are in this area.</p>

<h3 id="e25">Shanghai Municipal Council's Budget: Revenues and Expenditures Both Sharply Reduced; Actively Planning to Cut Spending and Increase Revenue to Seek Balance; Budget Table Has Begun to Be Prepared and Can Be Completed by the End of the Month <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>This year, the Shanghai Municipal Council's various tax revenues have trended downwards, estimated to decrease by several million yuan compared to last year. In order to seek a balance between revenues and expenditures, the Municipal Council is actively planning to cut spending and avoid unnecessary consumption. The Council's Finance Department has already begun to prepare this year's budget table, which will be submitted to the Board of Directors for resolution by the end of this month.</p>
<p>Shortfall of 1.7 Million for the Year</p>
<p>The Municipal Council's recurrent expenditure budget for last year was 80,109,770 yuan in revenue and 81,052,910 yuan in expenditure, with a shortfall of 943,170 yuan. The recurrent expenditure final account for last year was 89,445,000 yuan in revenue and 91,230,120 yuan in expenditure, resulting in a shortfall of 1,784,720 yuan. This figure is significantly reduced compared to the previous year's shortfall of 12 million yuan.</p>
<p>Various Tax Revenues Reduced Compared to the Past</p>
<p>As for this year's financial budget, it will change its approach due to the changing situation. It is expected that both revenue and expenditure will be greatly reduced. Since the shortage of gasoline and the restriction of car use, the revenue from car license fees has decreased by about 4 million yuan. Following the resolution of the Shanghai West tax issue, the tax revenue power has been transferred again. In addition, the revenue of more than 7 million yuan in the public utilities sector last year will also tend to decrease sharply this year due to the suspension of public buses and the reduced scope of other public utilities. Furthermore, the simultaneous closure of factories, companies, and firms has a great impact on the Municipal Council's revenue.</p>
<p>Expenditure Budget: Thoroughly Cut Spending</p>
<p>According to the latest estimate by the Municipal Council's Finance Department, the total revenue for this year is about 50 million yuan, a decrease of 30 million yuan compared to last year's revenue of more than 80 million yuan. Therefore, this year's expenditure budget will inevitably be greatly reduced accordingly. According to the Municipal Council's expenses in previous years, personnel expenses accounted for the largest part, and the cost of goods and equipment was about 20% to 30% of personnel expenses. In the future, thorough austerity measures may be implemented, and measures such as layoffs and salary reductions may be taken. Unnecessary groups such as the orchestra may also be disbanded.</p>
<p>Salaries and Allowances of Staff All Planned to Be Reduced</p>
<p>The February salaries of the Municipal Council's staff will also be reduced. The minimum salary has been revised to 500 yuan for unmarried staff, 1,000 yuan for married staff, 1,300 yuan for married staff with one child, and 1,500 yuan for married staff with more than one child. Staff who are unmarried or married without children and whose monthly salary exceeds the minimum salary by more than 500 yuan will have their salaries reduced by 20%. Married staff with children will have their salaries reduced by 10%. The maximum salary will be limited to 4,000 yuan. This is expected to save a total of 7 million yuan. In addition, the various allowances for staff totaled 2.5 million yuan last year, and an additional 650,000 yuan in pension funds was issued, totaling more than 3.1 million yuan. This expense is also planned to be reduced or abolished, and is currently under close consideration by the authorities.</p>
<p>Increase Revenue and Donations to Make Up for the Shortfall</p>
<p>After the personnel expenses are reduced in this way, about 10 million yuan can be saved, requiring more than 60 million yuan. In terms of the cost of goods and equipment, 5 million yuan can also be saved, requiring 12 million yuan, for a total expenditure of about 72 million yuan. If the total revenue is 50 million yuan, there is still a shortfall of 22 million yuan. This amount will probably be compensated by increasing revenue, such as increasing the donations for licenses for cars, bicycles, and other vehicles, as well as the fees for permits to transport controlled goods, which can increase revenue by about 5 million yuan. In the future, after the new rental regulations are implemented, a small amount of license fees can also be collected from second landlords.</p>
<p>Revenues and Expenditures for this Year Can Roughly Offset Each Other</p>
<p>Therefore, the revenues and expenditures for this year can roughly offset each other. However, the Municipal Council still has a deficit of 12 million yuan from previous years, and the outstanding debt is also as high as 89 million yuan, for a total debt of 111 million yuan. This huge amount of money still needs to be repaid by the authorities. On January 1 of this year, the Municipal Council originally intended to levy a special donation on business premises, but later decided to postpone the collection due to various reasons. If this special donation is levied, it is estimated that it can generate about 7 million yuan in revenue. However, in order to repay the entire debt, the issuance of public bonds is inevitable this year. As for special temporary expenses, short-term loans may be borrowed from banks to resolve them.</p>

<p>According to a report from a reporter of the Datong News Agency who inquired at the Shanghai Postal Administration, the Transportation Department of the Administration, in respect of the mail from Shanghai to Hong Kong, except for registered mail, light mail would be accepted and sent as usual, and that the transport route would be via Guangzhou, because there were steamships sailing between Shanghai and Guangzhou, with two or three sailings each month. There are now two ships operating between Guangzhou and Hong Kong, sailing to and fro daily. Mail from Shanghai to Hong Kong, relayed via Guangzhou, would, if the sailings were properly coordinated, take only ten days to reach, or at most one month. If sent by air, it would arrive on the same day. According to the Shanghai-Guangzhou air service, there are flights every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and the airmail, loaded on arrival in Guangzhou, can be loaded on ships sailing to Hong Kong on the same day, and transported there in the afternoon. Since Hong Kong underwent hostilities, postal facilities were managed and dispatched by the Japanese side in the name of the Field Postal Bureau. As to shipping between Hong Kong and overseas, this has not been restored. For overseas mail from Shanghai, only Vietnam and Thailand now have Japanese and French ships sailing, which can be directly shipped out. Mail for Germany is relayed via Turkey. Sea mail for Europe and America cannot be dispatched.</p>

<h3 id="e30">Increased Compensation for Photo Studio Staff <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Photo studio staff in the concession have requested that employers consider the hardships of staff and modestly increase their compensation to ensure their livelihood, because prices have risen exorbitantly and endlessly, and the burden of living has increased day by day, while their salaries have been difficult to sustain a living. Employers have generally found it difficult to accept the demands of staff because business has declined significantly recently and daily support has been difficult. After extensive negotiations between representatives of both labor and management, agreement was finally reached yesterday and a contract was signed as follows: Employers will increase special allowances for workers as follows: A. Workers earning less than 100 yuan per month will receive an allowance of 10 yuan. B. Workers earning more than 100 yuan per month will be subsidized by employers at 12 yuan and 50 cents. Year-end bonuses for workers will be issued in accordance with industry-wide announcements. It is said that the agreement has been implemented since February of this year.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Japanese Textile Mill Further Reduces Work <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>According to the Tongmeng News Agency in Zhabei, the Japanese textile mills in this city had agreed at a meeting on February 10 to reduce work by another one-tenth from March 1. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the Japanese textile mills have reduced their scope of work to four-tenths due to power saving and lack of imported raw materials. Now that it has been reduced by one-tenth again, its scope of work is only three-tenths of what it was before the outbreak of the Pacific War. If there are no changes in the situation in the future, this new method will be maintained until the end of August. It is also heard that Chinese textile mills with existing raw materials are still working in proportion to the halving of work, but they will soon be drastically reduced again.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Three Withdrawals from Banks of Allied Powers Difficult to Realize Recently; But Two Banks Have Already Recovered Huge Loans <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>The foreign banks in this city resumed operations at 10 am on the 19th, after the Spring Festival holiday, simultaneously with Chinese banks. The banks of the Allied Powers, such as Hui Feng and Maccary, also continued to implement the measures implemented before the Spring Festival holiday, paying the deposits of individual depositors, and opening safe deposit boxes. All restrictions remained unchanged. Only three banks, HSBC, Maccary, and Chase, opened safe deposit boxes. The number of people going to open and withdraw items has been very small. All banks were able to handle it within office hours.</p>
<p>Commercial Firms' Expenses Not Yet Approved</p>
<p>The opening method of the safe deposit box of Chase Bank, its restrictions are originally strict, only allowing the extraction of contract documents, and the handling of the transfer of legal currency, may be eased in the future. As for the application for the necessary expenses of commercial firms, as of now, no approval has been obtained. The application forms that have been filled out for review are still under consideration by the banks. It is also learned that the hope of the Japanese side approving the third withdrawal by the banks of the Allied Powers to handle the liquidation is difficult to realize recently. Many people in the banking industry believe that the realization of the third withdrawal still needs to wait until after January or February.</p>
<p>Recovery of Loans Varies from Bank to Bank</p>
<p>At present, at least two of the banks of the Allied Powers are able to pay for the third withdrawal. They have already repaid huge amounts of cash borrowed from various main loans, and in the near future, they can also expect to recover huge loans. However, the debt collection situation of other banks is not so smooth. Many believe that the Japanese side may allow most of the banks of the Allied Powers to handle the third withdrawal, and whether they will be allowed to withdraw again in the future, or whether it will be the last time, is unknown.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Case of Huge Robbery of 300,000 Yuan; Six Members of the Gang Arrested; Only a Small Part of the Original Stolen Goods Recovered; Two Main Culprits Still at Large <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>At 7 am on January 16 of this year, a Nanjing money house sent 300,000 yuan to Shanghai, dispatching staff Guo Chengyi and Chen Wenquan, hiding them in three small leather suitcases, and hiring rickshaws. When passing near the intersection of North Henan Road and Haining Road, they were suddenly attacked by four robbers, who pulled out their guns, dragged Guo and others into nearby No. 360 Heng, forbidding them to make any noise, and snatched the huge sum of money, fleeing in different directions. Guo immediately followed and reported to the police, drew his gun and chased, resulting in the shooting and killing of the brutal robber Liu Xiaobazi, a native of Jiangbei, but all the stolen money was taken away by his accomplices, making it impossible to find. Yesterday, the Chinese detectives of the Huizhong Concession Police Station, Feng Baishun and Huang Fusen, detective Yang Yunfeng, and detective Guo Xiangyao, based on a confidential tip, at No. 9 Robert Road, No. 155 Bai Linan Road, No. 1 Wulin Village, Kang Nao Tu Road, Jisi Fei'er Road and other places, successively arrested Wu Xiaobao, the wife of the slain robber Liu Xiaobazi, who confessed to five accomplices, including Zhu Dasizi, Xu Changsong, the woman Zhang Liu, Xu Zhu, and Min Qian. They were successively arrested at their addresses, and a part of the original stolen goods was seized, totaling more than 13,000 yuan. They confessed that the four leaders, Xiaogouzi and Xiaolucai, were at large, hiding in Nanjing. The two detectives, Feng and Huang, who were handling the case, immediately went to Nanjing. They learned that Xiaolucai was staying at a friend's house at No. 189 Gonghe Road and rushed to arrest him, but he had already fled upon hearing the news, and only a leather suitcase of the original thief was seized. The police station, considering that the robbery involved a huge sum of money, that a large amount of stolen money had not been recovered, and that the leaders and robbers were at large, detained the six men and women, including Wu Xiaobao, pending further investigation.</p>

<p>Death Statistics on French Concession Roads</p>
<p>The weather has been mild recently, but the cost of living in Shanghai is extremely high, making it impossible for ordinary poor people, drug addicts, and beggars to make a living. As a result, they suffer from hunger and cold and cannot resist, leading to death and corpses lying on the roadside, which has increased sharply compared to before. According to investigations within the French Concession, since New Year's Eve (when it rained and snowed all day), the bodies of 130 to 140 men and women have been found dead on the roads in the past week, mostly men, with only about 20 women, averaging nearly 30 people per day. Except for those with family members, the Tongren Fuyuan Branch handles the burial arrangements.</p>

<p>New Trends in Construction Industry</p>
<p>This year, the construction of new houses in the Public Concession seems to be concentrated on Chinese-style houses. The construction of subdivided buildings and Western-style houses is less sought after, and the construction of storage warehouses is also slightly active. However, the number of new houses built has decreased by more than half compared to last year. In December last year, 194 applications for building houses were filed in the Public Concession, and 129 were approved. The estimated value of the new houses built totaled more than 9.9 million yuan. In January this year, only 93 applications for building houses were filed, and only 67 were approved. The total value of these new houses is 1.4423 million yuan, accounting for about one-seventh of December last year. Among the new houses approved for construction in January, there were 44 Chinese-style houses, 4 warehouses, 2 Western-style houses, and 1 subdivided building. The distribution of new houses is the highest in the western district of the Public Concession, followed by the eastern district, the central district is less, and the northern district is the least.</p>

<p>Bright Spring Scenery Talks About Newlyweds</p>
<p>Wu Zhe</p>
<p>The birds are singing and the flowers are fragrant, spring has arrived, and young people feel an indescribable joy at this time, especially those who have just gotten married. Speaking of the word "newlyweds," according to the definition of the ancients, all women who have been married are newlyweds. If you think about the joy of this night, which can be the same as several ordinary nights, you will know that the consumption of this night can also be the same as several ordinary nights. Only by ensuring that this night is not harmed by marital injuries can you really talk about the strange labors of newlyweds. Flattering to gain favor, and also enduring different fatigue, bravely crossing the river, not knowing when to advance or retreat in moderation, and later seeing it, it is inevitable to suffer major setbacks, even exhaustion, and heavy problems. Like neurasthenia, poor memory, dull thinking, kidney deficiency and physical weakness, "Brain Kidney Ding" is the most powerful tonic for modern times. Everyone knows that this tonic can nourish the brain, strengthen the kidneys, consolidate essence, and increase strength. It is a unique and effective tonic that works repeatedly and is effective in hundreds of trials. Moreover, the medicinal properties are mild and the medicinal power is long-lasting. Men, women, old and young, can all take it, and it is suitable for all seasons. "Brain Kidney Ding" is sold in company pharmacies. General Manager Lu Jixing's Enlightenment</p>

<p>A Year Ago in Shanghai (1)</p>
<p>Translated by Wu Yancun</p>
<p>When travelers cross the East China Sea towards Shanghai, they will find that the vast blue sea suddenly turns into a muddy yellow stream. Above that is where the Yangtze River, 3,200 miles long, empties. This is the soil moved from Central China, and 188 million people live on this soil, which is roughly half of the "400 million customers." Shanghai, the gateway to Central China, still needs about five hours of sailing after crossing the border of this clear and turbid sea. During these five hours, the number of ships entering and exiting gradually increases, and what comes into view are the flags of various countries, such as the Sun Flag, the Union Jack, and the Stars and Stripes, but it is not easy to find Chinese ships. "There are so many foreign ships!" When thinking like that, although they have not yet reached the urban area of Shanghai, based on the foreign ships sailing on the mudflow, the initial impression is not far from the truth. Indeed, Shanghai is not only the center of Central China, but also the international economic center of the entire China!</p>
<p>Now, due to the results of the Second European War, the international economies of various countries in the world are showing abnormal conditions and have lost their original meaning. The world is divided into several economic groups, such as Britain and the United States, Germany and Italy, the Soviet Union, Japan, etc. Each has formulated self-sufficiency plans within its scope and gathered to form small organizations. However, in normal times, regardless of large or small countries, mutually exchanging goods, circulating funds, developing transportation, and people interacting with each other are all part of the international economy.</p>
<p>China is a part of the East Asian economy, which is parallel to Japan. At the same time, because of the opposing relationship, it is even more important. The reason for the opposition, in the simplest sentence, is because Japan is a semi-industrial country, while China is a raw material country. All countries are searching for raw materials from China and promoting goods. Carl Crow did not call the Chinese "400 million customers" without reason. (Translator's note: Carl Crow is a Shanghai advertiser, and "400 Million Customers" is the name of a book he wrote about China.)</p>
<p>In this way, China's international economy, which is centered on trade, naturally focuses on marine transportation. Now, because of the Japanese navy's coastal blockade, the Chinese inland is using the northwest and Myanmar routes. Originally, the problem of the transportation capacity of land trade had not occurred. All trade was almost entirely concentrated in the 26 commercial ports along the coast from Qinhuangdao in North China to Beihai in South China. Moreover, among these thirty-six commercial ports, only a few are directly related to foreign countries, and most are only indirectly connected because they are central locations connecting various regions. In North China, the center of such international economic activities is Tianjin and Qingdao, and in South China, it is Hong Kong. Further analysis shows that Central China is of course Shanghai as a major central location, and Shanghai is not only the center of Central China, but also the international economic center of the entire China.</p>
<p>After another hour, when the ship approached the famous Wusong Fort on the starboard side, we turned from the main stream of the Yangtze River into the tributary of the Huangpu River. In a broad sense, the port of Shanghai starts from here, and the port of Huangpu itself can be said to be the port of Shanghai. Later, turning left and right along the Huangpu River, on the right side, called Pudong, first see the huge oil tanks of the Anglo-American capital oil companies such as Mobil Company, Asiatic Company, and Texaco Company. Some oil tankers fly the Union Jack or the Stars and Stripes in the wind, and some are docked beside the pier. Like that, about 60 million liters of oil are transported to Shanghai every year, taking 1939 as an example, about 12 million liters were imported from the United States, and about 52 million liters were imported from the Dutch East Indies, with a price of 16 million yuan in legal currency. At a certain time, the oil stored in the Shanghai oil tanks from the United States and the Dutch East Indies was transferred to various ships on the Yangtze River and the tributaries of the Yangtze River and was widely distributed to various places in Central China. There is also a definite fact that about 40% of the oil from the Dutch East Indies is capital supplied by the British, and the promotion in the Chinese market is also handled by the British-owned Asiatic Company. Therefore, the battle for oil capital between Britain and the United States in front of the gate of China is also revealed. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<p>Cash Breaks Through 13,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Inside the Pass</p>
<p>The cash market continued to decline sharply, and the price has broken through 13,000 yuan. It is the Hefeng agent of the Tianjin Gang who is selling aggressively again. The morale of all parties is unstable. At the beginning of the fourth day, there was supply but no demand everywhere. The market price dropped step by step, and 12,700 yuan was the first transaction price, which was 600 yuan lower. The Tianjin Gang sold aggressively, and Decheng and others competed. Retail investors were particularly eager to sell, and the price continued to drop by 300 yuan, seeing a low price of 12,400 yuan. Yongfengyu and Tongkangyong (Nanjing Gang) and other cash houses absorbed at low prices, once rebounding by 600 yuan, raising to the 13,000 yuan mark. After 10:50, the Tianjin Gang sold again, and the gold shops and retail investors pressed to sell, immediately dropping to 12,780 yuan. Lemao Chengjibuy bought in. Because it was Saturday, the market closed early at 11:30, and the price was 12,800 yuan, which was 500 yuan lower than the previous day. It has fallen for three consecutive days, a total of 1,450 yuan. After the closing, it fell again to 2,650 yuan, a high and low of 600 yuan on the day, and the transaction was still clear. The price of jewelry gold was raised by another 50 yuan per tael to 1,350 yuan (150 yuan lower for receiving), standard silver was 14 yuan, and black market silver was 13 yuan, both flat. Silver dollars have fallen back to 8 yuan. Some sellers said. The money industry association's borrowing rate is still white, and the discount rate for exchange drafts and notes is flat. The foreign currency market is trending lower.

Military tickets soared to 4 yuan, 2 jiao. When the public debt falls, there is a low absorption of foreign stocks and continued firmness.</p>
<p>The public debt black market continued to fall yesterday. Although Tongyi and Dingyu rose up to buy strongly, they still failed to reverse the decline. Morale is still weak. However, although the downward trend has not stopped, every time the price falls, the transaction is greatly reduced. Now it has returned to its old state. Only one or two companies sold in large quantities, and one or two companies bought in enough to offset the sales. However, during this downward trend, many parties took advantage of the low price to absorb, and they were also unwilling to raise the price. It was found that there were no major reasons for this downward trend, mostly due to head positions and the supply and demand of chips. For example, the two companies with larger sales were Hengkang and Tongshun, but they were taken up in full by Dingyu and Tongyi. The remaining sales of Hu Heji and Tongxing were not significant. The market price has fallen for three consecutive days, and it may be slightly suppressed in the future. Yesterday's results, except for the type E that was not opened, the type D fell more significantly due to the lack of market the day before yesterday, falling by 1 yuan, 7 jiao, and the rest fell by 6 jiao to 1 yuan, 1 jiao. The transaction was only about 300,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below. The foreign stock market continued to rise, and the transaction has increased to 10,500 votes. Jardine Spinning Mill rose from 26 yuan, 7 jiao, and a half to 27 yuan. Xinyi Spinning Mill rose from 7 yuan, 4 jiao, and a half to 7 yuan, 7 jiao, and a half.

<p>That is, in the works of Diodore de Sicile, a Greek authoritative historian contemporary with Octavian at the end of the first century BC, or in the book Alexander's Biography written by the Greek Arrien in the second century AD, one cannot find any clues about oranges! However, what is strange is that: in the ancient Indian Kucha language called Sanscrit (Sanscrit language, there is also the word Nagrnga for oranges; it is from this word that the current Indian word for oranges, Narouji, has been transformed. When did the orange plant enter Buddhist India? According to the French Encyclopedia,</p>

The managing bank has already started payment on the 5th of this month.</p>
<p>The Price of National Rice Falls Again</p>
<p>Yesterday, although the national rice shops were greedy for demand, after the weather cleared, the burdeners gradually increased, and the retail price had already fallen sharply before the market. Therefore, the rice shops lowered their bids, and both thick and thin japonica rice immediately fell by 7 to 8 yuan. Northern Gang Gaokun japonica rice sold for 276 yuan to 273 yuan. The market price of 270 yuan green angle thin rice was 251 yuan, 250 yuan to 248 yuan. Southern Gang early rice was 251 yuan to 249 yuan and a half. However, Jintan Yuan rice was still being contested by wineries, rice carriers, and households, and there was little stock and no foreign yuan or yin yuan arriving. Therefore, the market rose again by 5 yuan yesterday, opening at a price of 255 yuan.</p>

Judgment: During the period of Nearqne and Diodore, that is, in the third century BC to the first century BC, India "West" must not have cultivated orange trees, and as for the east - the part close to Annam - it did not dare to say clearly. According to the Records of the Southwest Yi in the Historical Records: Zhang Ang saw Shu cloth and Qiong bamboo canes in the Daxia Kingdom and asked about their origin. The Daxia people said: "From the southeast body poison - India - the country, it can be thousands of miles, and the 'Shu merchants' market can be obtained. ... We can know that in the second century BC, Sichuan merchants did indeed trade with Indians: Did these "Shu merchants" also bring the "Shu gan tree orange" bridge seeds to India in addition to the Shu cloth and Qiong bamboo canes? Unfortunately, we have no way to directly study the historical records of India, and we have no time to look at the Buddhist scriptures: otherwise, we will surely get a lot of inspiration. (To be continued)</p>
<p>The bean cakes were sold off in bulk yesterday, and the price fell by 2 to 3 jiao. It is estimated that 1,000 pieces of Shengji bean cakes were sold, and the June warehouse receipt price was 31 yuan, 3 jiao, and the May warehouse receipt price was 30 yuan, 6 jiao. The bran skin customers were not declining, and the Kunshan gang followed the Wuxi gang to the city vegetables, and the local and rural households also needed it strongly. Therefore, while the traveling groups took the opportunity to sell at high prices, the market still stood at the original level. Sanshin bran skin sold 2,450 packages, priced at 64 yuan.</p>
<p>The excessive rise in cotton yarn caused profit-taking. The cotton yarn market rose for two consecutive days, and after the high yesterday, it turned down. This was because the degree of the rise was relatively large, causing profit-taking, which led to the downstream. However, the transaction was not large. The opening price of 20-count Shuangma factory order in the morning was 2,300 yuan, and it rose to 2,310 yuan in a flash. However, this high price did not stand firm, and a group of hoarders came out, and the price gradually fell to 2,170 yuan. The closing price rose slightly by 10 yuan to 2,180 yuan, which was 110 yuan lower than the previous day. 42-count Lanfeng 4,950 yuan to 4,840 yuan, 42-count Baoguang 4,900 yuan to 4,850 yuan, 32-count Xiantao 4,080 yuan to 50 yuan, 80-count Sunlight 11,200 yuan, 20-count Fengnian 2,950 yuan, 20-count Sunlight 2,840 yuan, 20-count Baoyi 2,420 yuan, 20-count Yueqin 2,715 yuan to 2,650 yuan, 20-count Shuangma spot price was 2,550 yuan to 2,450 yuan, 20-count Shuangdiqiu 2,470 yuan, 16-count Hongkuixing 2,200 yuan to 2,200 yuan, 16-count Fuyan 2,180 yuan, 10-count Boy Scout 1,700 yuan, 14-count Jinta 2,170 yuan.</p>
<p>The supply of piece goods is not strong.</p>
<p>The factory cloth market rose yesterday after noon. As a result, some cloth prices rose or fell by 2 jiao and a half to 5 jiao compared with the previous day. The number of new shops in this street is gradually increasing. This is because the factory orders of Yihuo and other factories still cannot be picked up, and the supply of goods in the hands of the same industry is not strong. Yihuo coarse cloth is the most popular, 11 pounds 82 yuan, 13 pounds 95 yuan, 14 pounds 102 yuan and a half, 16 pounds 122 yuan and a half, 16 pounds Feihong 102 yuan and a half, Shuanglong 115 yuan, all announced a slight increase.

<p>Dong cloth Sheng continued to rise, and then heard that foreign firms had extra sales, scattered more profits taken, and the price fell back. The highest dragon head factory order was 112 yuan, and the price fell to 108 yuan and a half, with a closing price drop of 2 yuan. Four gentlemen flannel new orders and new taxes were 3 yuan and 6 jiao, down 5 cents. Inter-industry purchases were very strong, and the dyeing factory's stomach was quite dull.</p>
<p>The woolen red plate is firm.</p>
<p>The general line numbers, factories, and joint companies of the woolen red plate have mostly opened one after another. The red plate prices are mostly firmer and more expensive than last year. The colors on the market are more scarce than in previous years. Therefore, most wholesalers still delay the opening of the market, because the current situation is special, and they are watching the changes in the market.</p>
<p>The sale of cigarettes is still popular.</p>
<p>Since the opening price of cigarettes on the red plate, each brand has continued to rise. The goods stored in the warehouse are not enough for market sales, and there is still no definite news from the factory about the distribution of goods, so the market price continues to be popular. Yesterday, the price of each box of British brand cigarettes still reached a high price of 7,800 yuan, Laodao brand 6,800 yuan, Wuhua brand 4,400 yuan, Xiaoxiannv brand 4,400 yuan, 50-branch Datosanpaotai 12,700 yuan per 10,000, Japanese merchant cigarettes Jintang brand 1,520 yuan, Jindalou 1,650 yuan, Quanlu brand 2,070 yuan, calculated as 25,000 branches.</p>

<p>Why Doesn't Spring and Autumn Eat Corn?</p>
<p>Zhi Cang</p>
<p>The current food problem is really a knot in the hearts of us small citizens. When will it be relaxed a little, or even perfectly resolved? I can't help but sigh three times, I want to ask the sky, but the sky can't answer.</p>
<p>But "Heaven never seals off all exits," seems to be a clear instruction. Although I lament that I was born at the wrong time, in order to cope with reality, I have to harden my head and work one day at a time, ringing the bell crisply and loudly, regardless of whether it is hoarse and dim. This is not necessarily a way to comfort oneself.</p>
<p>The Public Works Bureau has been advising citizens to eat corn, which is very kind. Indeed, since the beginning of Chinese history, people have mainly relied on rice for food, especially in the south. But what about now? We have to ask about grains below rice. I once heard the</p>

The treatment was ineffective, and he soon died.</p>
<p>Cai Rongzhang, a native of Ningbo, 39 years old this year, went to Room 39, Siming Hotel, No. 96, Avenue Edward VII on the afternoon of the 18th, due to unemployment and economic pressure, unable to maintain his livelihood. He then took poison to commit suicide on the night of the 19th. It was not until noon the next day that the room service found him already dead in bed. They immediately reported to the French Concession Police, who sent detectives to investigate. The deceased left no suicide note and had no possessions left behind, making it impossible to investigate his family. The corpse was carried to the morgue for examination. Yesterday, the charity organization provided coffin and burial, waiting for relatives to claim.</p>

On the 1st of this month, he pledged two diamond rings to a friend for 1,000 national currency for use. Unexpectedly, the next day, the creditor discovered that both diamond rings were fakes. On the 11th, the creditor met Shen at the Anle Palace Hotel and urged Shen to redeem the diamond rings.
