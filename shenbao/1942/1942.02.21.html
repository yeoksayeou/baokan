<p>本報特稿</p>
<h3>華維爾論將才（二）</h3>
<p>我記得許多年前當我還是一個少年軍官的時候，一個山砲兵裏的朋友吿訴我說，從前要是有一尊新標子的山砲建造出來，呈交砲械委員會試騐，必定先運到一座幾百呎高的塔頂上，將其推下地來，假使着地後，這尊砲還可以使用，纔再行試放，假使已不堪使用，便視爲脆弱而加以拒絕了。委員會的理由是說騾子和山砲極易在山坡失足下墜，所以必須有經受這種小磨雜的力量。因爲同樣的緣故，我們知道來復槍和自動機槍送到輕兵器委員會後，也要先埋在泥地裏約四十八小時，然後試騐火力。這個道理可以引上次大戰中的一件事實來做例證。那時，加拿大軍隊開抵法國，其所携來復槍係羅斯式，道槍平日在俾斯萊打靶塲原有卓越的射擊紀錄。可是在戰壕的泥地裏應用，幾發之後便覺阻塞，所以在實際戰鬥中，只經短時期的試用，即爲加拿大士兵所棄絕，而定要改用英國式來復槍了。</p>
<p>現在講到將帥在戰爭期間的心境就彷彿天天埋在不可靠的情報和不確定的因素中，何止四十八小時呢；而且往往因敵軍的奇襲，意外的事故，或天時的突變，隨時可以受到重大打擊，無殊從幾百呎高的地方跌下來，碰在石頭上。在戰事中，纖巧脆弱的機件實在一無用處；這句話就指揮官的心志體力來說也對，就軍隊的士氣以及武器裝備來說也對。所以一切有關乎戰爭的物事，包括將領在內，都必須有高出尋常極限强度的堅實性。常常有人說，英國的戰具過於堅固了，似非必要，大概英國的將領也是如此罷。但是我們能够超越極限强度，使處處多留穩妥餘地，一定是不會錯的。</p>
<p>戰爭究竟是一種藝術還是一門科學，這問題不時有人在爭辯討論。此次約我來講演的請柬上是說題目隨擇戰爭「科學」之某一部門。假使　請柬是從另一所見解相反的大學裏發出來，恐怕就敢稱戰爭「藝術」了。但是當一個藝術家或科學家經年累月孜孜工作的時候，無論他是一幅書，彫一尊像，或做一個實騐，若說同他競爭的人竟然可以任意的投以巨石，竊取其工具，並毀損其物資，豈非天下奇談，要是眞有這樣情形，那裏還能够產生多少偉大的藝術作品或科學發明呢。所以在文事方而作比較，祇能說戰爭是一種競技，一種野蠻卑劣的競技，參加的人皆須有堅韌不拔之體力與心志。戰爭時士兵生命無異是操在將領手中，故非有堅靱不拔的精神不克担負這種緊張的責任。上次大戰時曾有許多將領猝然病故，由此一端即可窺知其緊張程度了。諸君讀戰史時，也應當注意到有多少次的失敗是造因於缺少這種堅韌不拔的力量啊！</p>

<p>春秋</p>
<h3>萬物風興又一春</h3>
<p>— 之滄</p>
<p>陽春草生，萬物風興，在春節的幾天裏，不能謂之春風駘蕩，却也略見溫暖。但在禹　年廿節的夜，雨雷霏霏,積雪頗厚。假休沐之便，靜處於家，雖免去衝風冒雪，顫慄於街頭巷尾之苦，然而也有仰望彤天，手足皸榢之感。</p>
<p>在翌晨總算見到了陽光，於是略略感覺到春天的氣息。可是寂寞得很。愛羅先珂曾說過：「在沙漠裹似的寂寞呀！」我的眼球尙能轉動，但蟄處斗室，祗足面壁而已。我也隱約聽到遠處鑼鼓之聲傳來，却也只二三迵旋就算了，細聆之下，似乎分外的寂寞，黯淡。自然，新春的鑼鼓，頻頻敲擊之下，對於一年辛苦的人，也是一種興奮的象徵，可以重新與時間奮鬥，我在學校唸書的時候，對於在路上一大隊義務奏樂者的玩意兒就大無好感，以爲稚態可掬；但在今，我假如一出門口，逢到如此興奮的一羣，在心底裏不免會發出一種反應來——這也可以說是一種「同嗚」，我能體味小市民的意境，他們這類要求自小自在的舉動大可不必「噓」之。所謂「羯鼓一催，則萬花齊放」，人呢，非要與「時序」競爭不可，否則不足以言活躍。</p>
<p>我是羨慕活躍的，但是爲什麽在這幾天中分外感到寂寞呢？難道已「垂垂老去」了嗎？攪鏡自照，不覺一笑置之。我自已的意境自己體味得有點不够了，於是我飮了一小杯酒，這是春天以來第一杯，不必　然，祗要活絡我的血管而不麻木我的神經，對於如此一杯，不妨不妨。這是「柏酒桃湯」的功用能。</p>
<p>宗檁刑楚歲時記有云：「正月一日，以錢其杖脚，迥以投糞帚上，云令如願。」此類亟求「如願」之情，我也一笑置之，原是小市民的「覆　之鮒」的心境而已。但我由此却記起「如願」的故事來：據說「如願」是一種仙女，獲得了如有要求，無不如願；但如願却也有限度，不能盲求。……這是「神話」，但也合理。我耍付以眞正的辛苦，才能如願，對了。在新春，我倒是「安份守已」，不願開家庭空頭支票的</p>
<h3>誕生</h3>
<p>— 韋格</p>
<p>友人以電話告我他的太太在醫院誕生麟兒的喜訊，連日徹夜無眠，倦眼竟爲之開展，似乎望見能够付予寄託的對象——新生。</p>
<p>隣居兒童在新年爭着向父母索取壓歲錢，幼童圍坐，居然也撲克一番，勝的敗的，弄得哭笑俱全；遊藝塲去不得，小心眼偏是鬧蹩扭，結果是父親做護衛，到已拉鐵門的小影戲院走一趟，讓他們死心塌地大吉。這些兒童的行爲，是一般都市兒童的表現，他們是學來的；有的間接來自小朋友處，有的直接由父母兄長在有意無意中直接敎悔。對此兒輩，誰也不能無所感。</p>
<p>兒童在未長成前，每人有共偉大的將來，即使孤兒院中的棄嬰，我們不能決定共他日必爲平凡人物，苦兒如斯，家庭中的兒童，做父母的應如何加以注意，事無鉅細，必須以敎養訓導，使之一長成爲原則，不能因偏愛而忽視，造成他日坍圮的基點。</p>
<p>中年人寄託希望於剛誕生的嬰兒，足見其自餒，若知如何盡灌溉培植之責，自餒者始能私心稍安。因友人誕兒而若有所感，自已現在膝下猶虛，然安知他日不愧爲人父？</p>
<p>[P各人自掃門前雪</p>
<p>— 金毅</p>
<p>大除夕雪花飛舞，迄晚未止，元旦開出門來，積雪已經結成堅冰，隔壁人家的娘姨正用劈硬柴的刀努力作淸除工作。但是弄堂的過路太狹，這些連冰帶雪的障礙物就移交到我家門口了；如果我家的娘姨也能够如此聰明，則由彼而此，山此而他，……到弄底最後一家的門口時，積雪盈尺也將見諸事實了。</p>
<p>從前看卓別麟的某一張影片（或許是「淘金記」），這位破靴子先生在大雪之後到人家門前去掃雪，也是從甲門口而乙門口，乙而丙，丙而丁，他的酬勞就麥克麥克了。卓別麟的影片富於諷刺，這「掃雪移交法」不知在沙士比亞的集子裏有過什麽「典」沒有，而在中國是有「各人自掃門前雪的古訓的。－－現在我竟也目睹了，大概古今中外，做人都以「少管閑事」爲上策（？）</p>
<p>但是我們門前的雪佔了兩裏面積是事實，要和那娘姨理論罷，他家的門上明明貼着「開門大吉」的紅紙，多說多話是不免要弄出什麼不吉利的「詞兒」來的；置之不理罷，出進旣不便，一不留神，或許還要「還元實」。一直到下午，淸道夫　如數收訖才放下了一件心事。</p>
<p>我不反對「莫管他家屋上霜」，關起大門做皇帝那是各人的自由，然而「己所勿欲，賜之予人」也不甚符合「少管閑事」的原則的：一是他人至少要因你的門前雪」而多管一下閑事；二是大家效法「移交」，聚沙成塔，萬一阻塞了弄堂，在自家門口賞雪山也不會是賞心悅目的。</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>㈠風雨之夕</p>
<p>據說還是楚國春申君開　的黃浦江，一匹白練似的，橫躺在一塊大地中間。江水滔滔不絕，正不知淘盡了古今多少人物，也不知載來了東西多少文明，這因爲黃浦江西岸，便是全國經濟中心和交通中心的上海呀。</p>
<p>上海的繁華，是無待贅言的，只市廛的鱗次榔比，行人的肩摩踵接，二語已經足以概括之了。惟其這樣繁華，一般人的心理，只是歡喜天天放晴，不歡喜一年三百六十五天裏，有一天刮風下雨，妨礙他們的出遊。倘然在文字上，發現什麼「湖心亭賞雨」，「跑馬廳聽雨」，「黃浦江看雨」，那是自命爲文人的詩集子裹的話，却不是一般上海人的普遍心理。尤其是禮拜六下午，和禮拜日全日，老天下雨不得；倘竟下雨，咒詛是不能倖免的。</p>
<p>也是一個笑話：有一年，老天和上海人有仇似的，一到禮拜六下午，便淅淅瀝瀝下起雨來，到禮拜一上午，倒又雨散雲收，一連十幾個星期，都是如此。竟有人提議：「上海人的享樂日期，被上天知道了，不如把禮拜三改爲禮拜日吧，免得盼望了一星期的遊興，交爲風雨所阻。」這雖然不曾成爲事實，也可以見到上海人是如何厭惡雨天。</p>
<p>然而老天是不管你們歡喜和厭惡的，它要下雨，是誰也攔阻不了。是歲暮天寒的一天，又下雨了；先是陰雲四合，接着刮起一陣冷風，雨點便由疏而密，由細而大，從上海的上空，不斷的灑下來。這時，六路圓路電車，正從北火車站東駛，駛過白渡橋，沿着黃浦灘前行。每到一站，車廂裹吐出幾個鼓着勇氣去冒雨的男女，又吸進幾個已經被風吹雨打的男女。車廂裏用木梗子釘的地板上，驟然望下去，成了幾道小小的河流。一個正襟危坐的靑年學生葉維城，他那淸秀的臉上，顯現着小安，反手在玻璃窗上劃了幾劃，想看看窗外是個什麽景色。可是不濟事，窗內的一重薄霧，固然給他擦去了，窗外却依舊被雨條雨點封鎖着；白茫茫一片，連黃浦江裏火輪船的輪廓都看不出來。</p>
<h3>梅熹秘密離滬　白雲上官雲珠偕行</h3>
<p>— 太虛</p>
<p>「木蘭從軍」之後的梅熹，在國聯公司的地位是當然的「首席小生」，那時被派他主演的戲幾乎有分身乏術之苦，但不久梅熹的地位被劉瓊與顧也魯取而代之，創辦聯星公司或許就是爲了這個緣故吧。可是太平洋的烽火叉使他的「秋僅」吿吹了。空閑的時間一多，消費的支出也因之激增，外傳梅熹積蓄甚富，事實上却並不如此，於是在小除夕之夜，梅熹秘密離開上海了。</p>
<p>國聯公司曾接到梅熹太太的信，要求公司卹念多年賓主之情，貸五百金度歲，這更證明梅熹的私蓄是「意外」的支出了。</p>
<p>據說梅熹此行的目的地是靑島，偕與同行的有白雲，上官雲珠，蒙納，周芻等。按照這「陣容」推測起來，大槪是上靑島去演「秋風戲」的；如果這推測果而不錯，那末所演的劇目大概又是「雷雨」興「日出」等等的「本作戲」。</p>
<p>以如許大明星爲號召，「略有收穫」是沒有問題的，不過內地的小姐們對於大明星的崇仰不幸而與上海的「丹心格」有同樣作風的話，其「收穫」的成績就不能預測了。</p>

<h3>British Wartime Cabinet Reorganized: Churchill Remains Prime Minister, Cabinet Members Reduced from Nine to Seven, Cripps Appointed Lord Privy Seal</h3>
<p>London, February 20th (Reuters) – The British Cabinet has now been reorganized as follows: Prime Minister, Minister of Finance and Minister of Defence, Churchill; Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Dominion Affairs, Attlee (formerly Lord Privy Seal); Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Commons, Cripps (formerly Ambassador to the Soviet Union); Lord President of the Council, Anderson; Foreign Secretary, Eden (reappointed); Minister of State, Lyttelton (formerly Minister of State in the Near East); Minister of Labour, Bevin. All the above are members of the wartime cabinet. The wartime cabinet originally had nine members, now reduced to seven. As for the former Minister of Aircraft Production, Beaverbrook, he has left the wartime cabinet and will be stationed in the United States to oversee the coordination of resources between Britain and the United States. After the cabinet reshuffle, Prime Minister Churchill, except for extremely important periods, may not need to attend the House of Commons to report on military and political affairs and answer questions from members of Parliament, which can be handled by Cripps instead.</p>
<p>London, February 19th (Havas) – King George VI received the former Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Stafford Cripps, today and had lunch with him.</p>
<p>London, February 17th (Havas) – King George VI summoned Prime Minister Churchill today and had lunch with him.</p>
<p>London, February 15th (Havas) – Prime Minister Churchill delivered a broadcast address to the nation on this, the darkest day of the British Empire, reporting that Singapore and the entire Malay Peninsula had fallen. He urged listeners not to be disappointed and not to use the current setbacks to attack the government. Churchill's speech was rebroadcast by various American radio stations. He first recounted the evolution of the European war before the outbreak of the Pacific war, stating briefly: "When President Roosevelt and I signed the Atlantic Charter, the Germans were planning to crush the Red Army in order to occupy major Soviet cities. Britain fought alone, suffering oppression everywhere, relying solely on valuable American military supplies to survive. We were unable to fight Japan because we were assisting the Soviet Union in fighting Hitler. However, in 1941, our position had improved greatly compared to the dark days of 1940. The most important fact was that the United States was of one heart and mind with us, fighting side by side. Therefore, I crossed the Atlantic again to meet with President Roosevelt for the second time and comprehensively allocate all the resources of Britain and the United States." At this point, Churchill touched on the situation in the Soviet Union, emphasizing that Leningrad and Moscow were still in the hands of the Red Army, and that Japan's entry into the war was another fact that we should consider. In the past, because we were fighting Germany and Italy, we could not defend the Far East and confront Japan alone, because we were defending the Nile and other regions, and our resources had already been used to the extreme. There was not a single ship, vehicle, or aircraft that was not being used. While we defended our own territory, we had to assist the Soviet Union. If Japan had entered the war at that time, our only hope was to expect the United States to fight alongside us." Churchill then admitted that the British government had previously doubted that Japan would necessarily enter the war to confront the British-American alliance, because Japan had not attacked Britain in more favorable circumstances. The strength of the Japanese war machine should not be underestimated, as facts have now proven. However, if we were not restrained by Germany and Italy, we would be able to make full preparations. Churchill concluded by urging the people to continue to resist, emulating the spirit of the Soviet people, because Moscow was threatened during the darkest period in Soviet history, but the Soviet people never weakened the power of their leaders. It goes without saying that the British democratic system should be absolutely preserved, but the setbacks in the war should not be used to oppose the government. It must be understood that Singapore has now fallen, the Malay Peninsula has also been occupied, and other dangers are threatening us. However, the facts of our past overcoming difficulties are all there, and the people of the country should not find it difficult to recall them. This is the time for Britain to show a spirit of calm and perseverance. The future of mankind depends on our efforts and actions, he said.</p>
<p>British House of Commons to Hold Special Debate on the Far East War Situation</p>
<p>London, February 19th (Reuters) – Attlee reported to the House of Commons that at the next meeting, there would be a debate on the current situation, especially on the Far East war situation. The meeting could move to adjourn, but in order to thoroughly review the Far East war situation, a closed-door meeting would follow. The debate would continue for three days.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting on the Bilin River in Burma; Chiang Mai in Northern Thailand Bombed</h3>
<p>Rangoon, February 20th (Reuters) – Military authorities announced last night that fighting had broken out after our troops retreated behind the Bilin River. Japanese forces had cut off the western flank of our troops north of the Bilin River. Our troops immediately counterattacked, and the two armies are engaged in fierce fighting. Our bombers, escorted by Hurricane fighters and Allied fighters, bombed positions east of the Bilin River on Wednesday. The Indian Air Force conducted reconnaissance flights throughout the day. According to Sydney radio reports, the Australian Air Force was active in the Moulmein area and northern Thailand.</p>

<h3>Tojo's Speech</h3>
<p>Tokyo, February 18th (Haito) – Prime Minister Tojo delivered a speech today at a public gathering celebrating the fall of Singapore, stating that the occupation of Singapore is the birthday of a new Asia and a turning point in world history. After being oppressed by Britain and the United States, Japan has recently recaptured the British and American bases in East Asia in a short period of time. The development of the Pacific War will enable the leaders of Britain and the United States to realize the error of underestimating Japan's strength. The economic encirclement policy has also not been effective. The Prime Minister then mentioned the cooperation between Japan, Germany, and Italy. Later, the German Ambassador, Watter, and the Italian Ambassador, Intal, also came to deliver brief speeches.</p>

<p>Batavia, February 15th (Reuters) – A batch of wounded soldiers who arrived here today gave a very detailed account of the situation in Singapore on the last days of the battle. According to reports, Singapore was like a "burning hell." When they left the island, the entire island was shrouded in thick smoke, and the smoke billowed upwards without end. It was difficult to see anything for miles around. Countless refugees were lying on the streets, in the parks, and in the suburbs, mixed with exhausted soldiers who had retreated from the front lines for a temporary rest.</p>
<p>Tokyo, February 18th (Haito) – A Japanese war correspondent described in detail the situation in Singapore within hours after the surrender. The British residential areas had all been dug into trenches, and cannons were hidden behind the short hedges. The streets were filled with British and Indian soldiers and civilians. Japanese soldiers first occupied the police headquarters in the center of the city. The British police asked the Japanese army to allow them to continue to perform their duties in order to maintain law and order in the city. British prisoners of war were being sent to the railway station, part of which had been destroyed during the air raid. To the south was the Imperial Dockyard, with two 1,000-ton ships overturned in it. The city's chamber of commerce and many banks had been converted into Red Cross societies.</p>
<p>Colonel Kamada's Remarks</p>
<p>Colonel Kamada, the head of the press department of the Japanese China Area Fleet, said in a speech: "I am extremely pleased to have received the Japanese army's announcement of the complete occupation of Singapore. Only seven weeks have passed since the start of the Greater East Asia War, and Singapore has succumbed to the might of the Japanese army. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the officers and soldiers of the Japanese army for their profound strategy and courageous and agile autonomy. The so-called anti-Axis countries under the guidance of Britain and the United States have imposed unreasonable oppression on Japan. This time, Japan resolutely took up the sword of justice. Without delay, the American Pacific Fleet was defeated by the Japanese army in the waters off Hawaii. Subsequently, the Japanese army annihilated the British Far East Fleet in the Malayan waters and the Dutch East Indies Fleet in the Java Sea. By this point, the enemy fleet has become demoralized and unable to do anything. Now that its last base, Singapore, has been captured, the so-called anti-Axis front has no room for activity in East Asia in the future. Moreover, the important resources of the South Sea are all under the control of Japan, which will promote the smooth construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."</p>

<h3>Hua Weier Discusses the Qualities of a General (Part Two)</h3>
<p>I remember many years ago, when I was still a young military officer, a friend in a mountain artillery unit told me that in the past, whenever a new model mountain gun was manufactured and submitted to the Ordnance Committee for testing, it would first be transported to the top of a tower several hundred feet high and pushed to the ground. If the gun was still usable after landing, it would then be test-fired. If it was unusable, it would be considered fragile and rejected. The committee's reasoning was that mules and mountain guns were very likely to slip and fall on mountain slopes, so they had to have the strength to withstand such minor mishaps. For the same reason, we know that rifles and automatic machine guns, after being sent to the Small Arms Committee, would first be buried in mud for about forty-eight hours before being tested for firepower. This principle can be illustrated by an incident in the last Great War. At that time, when the Canadian army arrived in France, the rifles they brought were Ross rifles, which had excellent shooting records at the Bisley shooting range in peacetime. However, when used in the muddy trenches, they became jammed after a few shots. Therefore, after a short period of trial use in actual combat, they were abandoned by Canadian soldiers, who insisted on switching to British-style rifles.</p>
<p>Now, talking about the state of mind of generals during wartime is like being buried in unreliable intelligence and uncertain factors every day, not just for forty-eight hours. Moreover, they are often subject to major blows at any time due to enemy surprise attacks, unexpected accidents, or sudden changes in the weather, no different from falling from a height of several hundred feet and hitting rocks. In war, delicate and fragile mechanisms are truly useless. This statement is also true for the mental and physical strength of commanders, as well as for the morale of the troops and the equipment of weapons. Therefore, everything related to war, including generals, must have a solidity that far exceeds the ordinary limits of strength. It is often said that British war equipment is too strong, seemingly unnecessarily so. Perhaps British generals are the same. But we can exceed the limits of strength, leaving a safe margin everywhere, and we will certainly not be wrong.</p>
<p>Whether war is an art or a science is a question that is constantly debated. The invitation to me to speak today stated that the topic was a certain department of the "science" of war. If the invitation had come from another university with an opposing view, it would probably have been called the "art" of war. But when an artist or scientist works diligently for years, whether painting a picture, sculpting a statue, or conducting an experiment, it would be unheard of if his competitors could arbitrarily throw huge stones at him, steal his tools, and destroy his materials. If such a situation really existed, how many great works of art or scientific inventions could be produced? Therefore, comparing it to literary endeavors, it can only be said that war is a competition, a barbaric and base competition, and those who participate must have the tenacious physical and mental strength. In war, the lives of soldiers are in the hands of the generals, so one must have a tenacious spirit to bear this tense responsibility. During the last Great War, many generals died suddenly of illness, which gives us a glimpse into the degree of tension. When you read war history, you should also note how many failures were caused by the lack of this tenacious strength!</p>

<h3>The Supreme Court of Lyon Announces the Crimes of Daladier and Five Others. Neglect of Duty is Judged According to the Newly Promulgated Laws. A Separate Secret Trial Will Be Held for the Diplomatic and Military Parts.</h3>
<p>Lyon, 20th (Havas) - The Supreme Court of Lyon today began hearing the cases of the key figures accused of harming the country. The President of the Court read out the crimes of each person as follows: Daladier: As the former Prime Minister and Minister of the Army, Daladier neglected his duty. He made no preparations for military training, industrial mobilization, military production, and air defense equipment. He also submitted incorrect reports to the parliament. Blum: Blum implemented labor laws that endangered national defense. He was unable to suppress revolutionary propaganda, resulting in insufficient production. Gamlin: Gamlin failed to urge the government to step up military production. The organization of the supreme command during the war was also flawed, leading to defeat. Cote (absent): As the former Minister of Aviation, Cote neglected to organize the air force. He also nationalized military factories, further reducing military production. He also supplied new-style aircraft to the Spanish Republican government. La Chambre: As the former Minister of Aviation, La Chambre was weak and incompetent in dealing with worker activities, resulting in insufficient industrial production. He also provided false reports to industrial investigation agencies. Jacomet: As the former Director-General of Military Supplies, Jacomet neglected his duty and failed to supervise military production. He failed to make practical preparations for industrial mobilization in advance and failed to implement it afterward. He also provided false reports to his superiors and the parliament. Furthermore, on August 22, 1939, at the request of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Daladier convened a military meeting. At that time, military leaders, in light of the defeat and destruction of Poland, raised questions and asked whether the government had confidence. Gamlin said that the military was ready, and La Chambre also said that the air force had made great progress. Daladier deliberately instructed them to give these answers so that the Minister of Foreign Affairs would not have to consider various military possibilities in diplomacy. From this, it can be inferred that the above-mentioned officials have been neglecting their duties for a long time, at least ten years. According to the order issued by the government on August 1, 1940, the actions of these officials constitute crimes. The punishments they deserve will be judged according to the law promulgated on July 31, 1941. As for the diplomatic and military parts, due to national security, it is difficult to announce them publicly, and a separate secret trial will be held.</p>
<p>Blum's and Others' Arguments</p>
<p>Lyon, 19th (Havas) - The Supreme Court of Lyon held its first hearing at 1:30 PM today to try the key figures accused of harming the country. After the President of the Court read out the charges, he identified the defendants. General Gamlin, the former Commander-in-Chief of National Defense, spoke first, saying, "During the trial period, I do not wish to say a word, because in the past I repeatedly wanted to submit my resignation, but I ultimately believed that my duty was still to be the leader of the French army, navy, and air force. At this moment, I again believe that my responsibility to the country and the army is to remain silent." General Gamlin's lawyer also claimed that General Gamlin's silence was due to his spirit of sacrifice. The general is willing to take all responsibility and does not want to implicate his subordinates. The main reason for France's defeat in this war was the chaotic state of the democratic political system. The general has no responsibility to speak of. France has always been known for its fairness in the world, and he still firmly believes in this traditional spirit. Next, Blum, the former Prime Minister of the People's Front Cabinet, spoke, expressing his surprise at General Gamlin's decision to remain silent, stating, "This trial, all testimonies will be kept secret, but now that General Gamlin has withdrawn from the trial, it is as if he is not here during the trial proceedings. In my opinion, France's defeat in this war was actually a military defeat, but because of General Gamlin's silence, it is as if the military part will no longer be tried. Therefore, I cannot agree with Gamlin's silence, because he must bear full responsibility for this defeat. The court has refused to listen to the testimony of military witnesses, which makes me doubt the concept of judicial independence. It should be known that the verdict for us has already been decided, but we must still strive to participate in the debate. Where the truth lies, it will not be difficult to find out. What you are trying is not [blank], but the political system." At this point, President Jaoce immediately replied that the Supreme Court of Lyon is completely independent, which has been stated on record. At this point, Blum's lawyer claimed that French law has never recognized the principle of "retroactivity," but the law on which this court is based was made after the fact, which is very inappropriate. Finally, former Prime Minister Daladier spoke, saying, "I have been detained for seventeen months and have never had the opportunity to defend myself. In the current European war, Germany is the main culprit and should bear full responsibility. However, Germany is trying its best to evade this responsibility." President Jaoce immediately warned Daladier that if he continued to involve foreign countries, the trial would be changed to a secret trial. Daladier then said, "After I took office as Minister of the Army, I realized the actual situation of the French army and immediately took various steps to improve the French army. Based on this, who is responsible for this defeat? I believe that our military leaders should be responsible. They dispersed our military strength. We had a large number of weapons stored in our country, but they did not know how to use them. My conscience is absolutely pure. I trust the court, respect the dignity of French justice, and believe that the traditional virtues of the French people have never been extinguished."</p>

<h3>Rice Prices Increase Daily, Supply Insufficient: Citizens Advised to Supplement Diet with Corn</h3>
<p>In the near future, rice shops will be given a grace period to sell corn. The Public Works Department has issued a proclamation urging citizens to switch to corn, as follows: "Since the beginning of Chinese history, rice has been the main food for the people. There is no doubt that rice is the most suitable food for Chinese people, not only because of its nutritional value but also because of its reasonable price and abundant supply. However, since the outbreak of the war, rice prices in Shanghai have risen daily and the supply has been gradually exhausted. Therefore, for the sake of the citizens, the urgent task is to consider adopting a food that can be eaten in combination with rice or completely replace rice when necessary.</p>
<p>Sold at Four Times the Price of Foreign Rice</p>
<p>When choosing a substitute, attention should be paid to ensuring that its quality is not too different from rice. For example, potatoes and beans are rich in nutrients and are inexpensive, but it is not easy to switch to these foods in a short period of time because their quality is very different from rice. As for corn (i.e., pearl rice), which is similar to rice and contains the same nutrients but is cheaper, it is the best choice. In the near future, corn will be sold in rice shops throughout the city. The amount allowed to be purchased each time is in a ratio of one part corn to four parts rice. Corn is cooked in the same way as rice, and the taste is good when mixed in equal parts. In addition, corn can be mixed with rice or cooked alone as porridge for breakfast. Fine-ground corn should be used for porridge, while coarse-ground corn can be mixed with rice or porridge. Now, the Food Control Committee of this Bureau urges the citizens of this city to try to eat corn in combination with rice so that the supply of stored rice can be extended and at the same time develop the habit of eating this food, which is no different from rice but is cheaper.</p>
<p>Registration Method for Corn Products</p>
<p>The Public Works Department recently issued Proclamation No. 5793, stating that in order to use corn flour and crushed corn as part of flour and rice, the Bureau hereby announces the following: All owners of various crushed corn or corn flour stored in the Public Concession must register these stocks with the Bureau no later than 12:00 noon on Tuesday, the 24th of this month. The registration location is the Bureau's Price Control Office on the fifth floor of the Asiatic Petroleum Company Building at No. 1 The Bund. Registration forms can be obtained from that office. Stocks that have not been registered after that day will be confiscated without compensation. From the 21st of this month, it is forbidden to transport or export any kind of corn flour or crushed corn exceeding 25 pounds in the Public Concession without first obtaining a permit from the Bureau. Transportation permits can be obtained from the following locations: (A) Corn Flour: Office No. 801, General Office of the Bureau, No. 209 Jiangxi Road; (B) Crushed Corn: Office No. 701, General Office of the Bureau, No. 209 Jiangxi Road.

<p>Several terrorist incidents occurred in the Public Concession on the evening of February 14th (i.e., Lunar New Year's Eve). The Japanese military authorities imposed a lockdown on the incident locations and their vicinity. The situation from various parties is compiled below.</p>
<p>Alert Drill Scheduled to Be Implemented</p>
<p>The Shanghai Police Department has decided to conduct an alert drill for terrorist incidents and issued the following advance notice on the 20th: In order to prevent the occurrence of terrorist incidents, the authorities and the people will conduct a drill to arrest criminals. This drill will be carried out repeatedly over a long period of time until the goal is achieved. The general public must abide by the following items and cooperate to achieve the purpose of the drill: Those who witness a terrorist incident should shout "Terror!" loudly to inform nearby residents and pedestrians to do their best to arrest the perpetrator. Those who witness or hear of a terrorist incident should immediately report it to the nearest official or self-defense corps. Telephone users have an obligation to notify the authorities when they receive a report. Those who witness a terrorist incident must remember the perpetrator's appearance, clothing, and direction of escape and automatically report it after the officials arrive. Individuals or groups who bravely pursue and arrest the perpetrator or cooperate with the officials will be rewarded by the authorities as appropriate. Those who do not comply with the above items will be punished after being discovered by supervisors. The drill perpetrators will wear red and white armbands on their left arms with the words "Drill Perpetrator" written on them. It is forbidden to commit violence against drill perpetrators.</p>
<p>Statement by the Japanese Naval Authorities</p>
<p>The Japanese Marine Corps authorities issued a statement saying that when terrorist incidents occurred in the Public Concession on February 14th, the Japanese Marine Corps cooperated with the Military Police and the Bureau's Arresting Office to lock down the area surrounded by Henan Road, Avenue Edward VII, Yu Qiaqing Road, and Suzhou Creek. The lockdown was lifted on the 17th, but the four locations where the incidents occurred were still under partial lockdown, prohibiting traffic. The Japanese military implemented the lockdown based on the emergency announcement issued by the supreme commanders of the Japanese army and navy stationed in Shanghai on December 14th of last year. The suffering of the residents of the area, both mentally and physically, and economically, can be easily imagined. However, the losses and suffering caused by terrorist incidents are even greater and deeper. Some areas in Shanghai have now implemented the baojia system or cooperate with the authorities to arrest criminals. If all the citizens of Shanghai do so, terrorist incidents will definitely disappear. The Marine Corps authorities hereby declare that unless the residents of the locked-down areas become aware of themselves and work out effective measures, the lockdown will never be lifted.</p>
<h3>New Rates for Land Tax in the French Concession: Add 16/1000 to the Assessed Value</h3>

This year's land tax will be levied at 16/1000 of the new assessed value, that is, 160 yuan will be levied for every 10,000 yuan of assessed value. It will still be collected in two installments in the spring and autumn.</p>

<h3>Departure of the "D'Artagnan" Delayed; The "General Joffre" Requisitioned by the United States</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, international shipping to and from this city, except for Japanese ships which continue to operate as usual, has been completely suspended. In the middle of last month, two French vessels, the "Général de Trentinian" and the "Arbre Salués," arrived in Shanghai from Haiphong and have since returned to Vietnam one after another, as reported in previous issues. As for the French mail ship "D'Artagnan," which arrived in Shanghai from Saigon on November 20th of last year, it has been unable to return to Saigon due to the impact of the Pacific War. It underwent repairs in Shanghai and was completed in the middle of this month. It was originally scheduled to depart Shanghai on the 18th to return to Saigon and Haiphong. However, the 18th coincided with the Lunar New Year, and there was insufficient time for loading cargo, so the departure was postponed to yesterday afternoon. According to a statement released by the company yesterday, the "D'Artagnan" was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai at 3 pm yesterday to return to Saigon, but the export procedures have not yet been completed, so the departure has been temporarily suspended. Once the export procedures are completed, it will return to Vietnam. It is said that there are forty to fifty French and Vietnamese passengers on board bound for Saigon, with only a hundred tons of cargo. Whether this ship and the previous two ships will return to Shanghai after returning to Vietnam, the local company is unable to confirm. Furthermore, the 12,000-ton French Line vessel "General Joffre" has been requisitioned by the U.S. authorities. Before the Pacific War, this ship regularly sailed between Shanghai, Manila, and Saigon. In early December of last year, it came to Shanghai to transport a batch of American expatriates to Manila. After the outbreak of the war, it was unable to leave Manila and was taken over by an American crew on December 12th and sailed to an American port.</p>

<h3>Post-Holiday Gold Market: Sudden Drop</h3>

<h3>Shift in Domestic Debt Investment; Weak Trading in Foreign Stocks</h3>
<p>The over-the-counter market for public bonds was on its second day after the Lunar New Year holiday, with a generally bullish sentiment. Most people were optimistic about the first red trading day, so the market price did not fall on the opening day. However, most market participants had already prepared to sell in the red market, causing the market to move easily and ultimately become unsustainable. Although strong bullish players were still absorbing, they were outnumbered. On the first day, it fell slightly by 4 jiao to 8.5 jiao. Yesterday, on the second day, bullish players and short sellers rose, causing the market price to fall further by 1.5 to 6 jiao. The trend indicates continued declines, partly because bullish players are still crowded, and partly because most materials have been released, causing a slight shift in investment objectives. However, strong bulls have not wavered and are still absorbing at low prices, so there should not be a larger decline. For example, Tongyi has been buying strongly over the past two days. Yitai and Hengxing have also made purchases. Shuntai, although initially selling, resumed buying yesterday. Dingkang has been consistently selling. Other firms such as Dakang, Chengjiu, RunDe, Xinhua, Yuxing, and Tongxing all sold yesterday, but in small amounts. The price declines over the two days have also been between 2 yuan and 2.35 yuan. Class B and C have even broken the 70 yuan mark again. Trading volume was high on the previous day, about one million yuan, but only 300,000 yuan yesterday.

<p>Dongbu's selling prices continued to rise, due to strong demand from peers and actual needs on this street. Leading factory singles opened jumping to 108 yuan, continuing to rise to 111 yuan. There was a small consolidation in the middle to 108.75 yuan, but ultimately closed around 110 yuan, up 3.75 yuan. Four Gentlemen serge new singles were 3.65 yuan, up 2 jiao per yard. Warehouse singles for Leading were 100.075 yuan to 100 yuan [number omitted] yuan. Colorful Ball was 103 yuan to 105 yuan, up over 3 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains All Rising</h3>
<p>Miscellaneous grains all saw a sharp rise, due to shortages and low inventories, especially with mung beans about to be sold out, rising 20 yuan. Tianjin mung beans were 120 yuan to 138 yuan. Other grains rose by 5, 6, or 7 yuan each. Yesterday, soybeans rose another 3 to 4 yuan. Tianjin Jinyuan sold 300 packages, priced at 157 yuan to 159.5 yuan.

Red sorghum sales were quite active, with a distillery on this street buying two cars of Mingguang red sorghum yesterday, new goods at 71 yuan, old goods at 62 yuan. Soybean cake continued to rise by 3 to 5 jiao, but later, due to hoarding sales, the result was a decrease of 2 or 3 jiao from before. Shenji soybean cake sold 8,000 pieces, with June warehouse singles priced at 32.6 yuan to 31.6 yuan, July warehouse singles at 33 yuan to 32 yuan, and January warehouse singles at 36.5 yuan. Raw peanuts sold 50 packages of Bengbu raw peanuts yesterday, priced at 225 yuan. Sesame sold 100 packages of Guandian white sesame, priced at 190 yuan.</p>
<p>In addition to inland merchants actively purchasing bran, local villages on this street are also inquiring, but both inventories and production are low, so the market is gradually rising. Yesterday, the Wuxi gang was particularly greedy, and the market continued to be strong. The opening price for Sanxin bran in February and spot goods was 64 yuan, and Ke Fu Orchid brand was 61.5 jiao to 7 jiao. Ke Fu traded 700 packages in two days, and Sanxin's term and spot totaled 3,300 to 400 packages, with prices rising by 2, 3, or 4 yuan each.</p>
<h3>Seafood All Rising</h3>
<p>Seafood all rose in the first market. Yesterday, round scallop meat opened at 2,700 yuan, broken scallop meat at 2,500 yuan. [missing character] Jiangbei early red nibe opened at 700 yuan, the second grade at 620 yuan, and Si[missing character] at 560 yuan.

<h3>The Spring Breeze Revives All Things Again</h3>
<p>— Zhi Cang</p>
<p>The warm spring grows grass, and all things are stirred by the wind. During the Spring Festival days, while one could not call it gentle breezes, a bit of warmth could be felt. But on the night of the Year-End Festival of the Wu [dynasty], there was drizzle and thunder, and the accumulated snow was quite thick. Taking advantage of the holiday, I quietly stayed at home, avoiding the suffering of facing wind and snow and shivering in the streets and alleys. However, there was also a feeling of looking up at the red sky with chapped hands and feet.</p>
<p>In the next morning, I finally saw the sunlight, and then I slightly felt the breath of spring. But it was very lonely. Eroshinko once said: "The loneliness is like being wrapped in a desert!" My eyeballs can still roll, but being confined in a small room, I can only face the wall. I also vaguely heard the sound of gongs and drums from afar, but they only revolved two or three times and then stopped. Listening carefully, it seemed extraordinarily lonely and dim. Of course, the frequent beating of New Year's gongs and drums is also a symbol of excitement for those who have worked hard for a year, allowing them to compete with time again. When I was in school, I had no good feelings about the games of a large group of volunteers playing music on the road, thinking that they were childish; but now, if I went out and encountered such an excited group, I would inevitably have a reaction in my heart - this can also be said to be a kind of "sympathy." I can appreciate the state of mind of ordinary citizens. There is no need to "shush" at this kind of behavior of asking for freedom since childhood. As the saying goes, "With the drum beats, all flowers bloom." People must compete with "time," otherwise it is not enough to call it active.</p>
<p>I envy those who are active, but why do I feel extraordinarily lonely these days? Have I already "reached the end of my days"? Looking in the mirror, I smiled and ignored it. I didn't have enough understanding of my own state of mind, so I drank a small glass of wine. This is the first glass since spring. It doesn't have to be, just as long as it activates my blood vessels without numbing my nerves. For such a glass, it's worth it. This is the function of "cypress wine and peach soup."</p>
<p>Zong Lin’s "Chronicle of the Chu Year" says: "On the first day of the first month, use money to tie its cane feet and throw it on the dung broom, saying that it will be as you wish." I also smiled and ignored this kind of eagerness to "get what you want," which is just the mentality of the "carp in a rut" of ordinary citizens. But from this, I remembered the story of "As You Wish": It is said that "As You Wish" is a kind of fairy. If one gets it, whatever one asks for will be fulfilled; but "As You Wish" also has its limits and cannot be blindly asked. … This is a "myth," but it is also reasonable. I have to pay with real hard work to get my wish, that's right. In the New Year, I am "satisfied and abide by the law" and unwilling to write a blank check for the family.</p>
<h3>Birth</h3>
<p>— Wei Ge</p>
<p>A friend telephoned to tell me the joyous news of his wife giving birth to a son in the hospital. Sleepless for days and nights, my weary eyes suddenly opened, as if seeing a newborn to whom one could entrust hopes.</p>
<p>Children in the neighborhood scramble for New Year's money from their parents. Little ones sit in a circle, even playing poker, some winning, some losing, resulting in a mix of laughter and tears. They can't go to amusement parks, and their petty minds are set on creating trouble. In the end, the father acts as a guardian, taking them for a trip to the movie theater, already with its iron gates pulled shut, to give them some peace of mind. These children's behaviors are typical of urban children, they are learned; some indirectly from friends, some directly taught by parents or older siblings intentionally or unintentionally. No one can remain indifferent to these children.</p>
<p>Before children grow up, each has a great future. Even with abandoned infants in orphanages, we cannot decide that they will surely be ordinary people. If impoverished orphans are like this, parents should pay attention to children in families, in everything big or small, and guide them to grow into adulthood. They cannot neglect them due to favoritism, creating a foundation for future collapse.</p>
<p>Middle-aged people placing their hopes on newly born infants shows their own discouragement. If they know how to fulfill their responsibilities of watering and nurturing, those discouraged can finally have some peace of mind. Feeling moved by my friend's newborn, even though I have no children of my own yet, how can I know that one day I won't be a father to be proud of?</p>
<p>[P Everyone Sweeps the Snow from Their Own Doorstep</p>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>Snowflakes danced on New Year's Eve, not stopping until late at night. On New Year's Day, when I opened the door, the accumulated snow had already frozen into solid ice. The maid of the family next door was diligently working to clear it away with a knife meant for splitting firewood. However, the alleyway was too narrow, so these obstacles of ice and snow were transferred to the front of my house. If my family's maid could also be so clever, then from there to here, from here to there... by the time it reached the last house at the end of the alley, the fact of snow piled a foot deep would be evident.</p>
<p>I once saw a Charlie Chaplin film (perhaps "The Gold Rush") where this tramp went door-to-door sweeping snow after a heavy snowfall, from house A to house B, B to C, C to D. His reward was a lot of money. Chaplin's films are rich in satire. I wonder if there's a "classic" example of this "snow-sweeping transfer method" in Shakespeare's collections. But in China, there's the ancient saying, "Everyone sweeps the snow from their own doorstep." Now I've witnessed it firsthand. Perhaps, throughout history and across cultures, "minding one's own business" is the best policy (?).</p>
<p>But the fact is that the snow in front of our door occupies two square meters. If I were to argue with that maid, the words "Good Luck Opening the Door" are clearly pasted on her door, and saying too much would inevitably bring about some unlucky "phrases." If I ignore it, it's inconvenient to go in and out, and if I'm not careful, I might even "fall flat." It wasn't until the afternoon, when the sanitation workers collected everything as counted, that I could finally set my mind at ease.</p>
<p>I don't object to "not minding the frost on someone else's roof." Closing the door and acting like an emperor is everyone's freedom. However, "Do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire" doesn't quite align with the principle of "minding one's own business." Firstly, others will at least have to "meddle" a little because of the "snow in front of your door"; secondly, if everyone imitates "transferring," piling up sand into a tower, it might block the alley, and admiring a snow mountain in front of one's own door won't be pleasing to the eye.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Boat in Wind and Rain</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>㈠ An Evening of Wind and Rain</p>
<p>It is said that the Huangpu River was dredged by Lord Chunshen of Chu. Like a white silk ribbon, it lies horizontally in the middle of a great land. The river flows continuously, I don't know how many figures of ancient and modern times it has washed away, nor how much civilization of the East and West it has carried. This is because the west bank of the Huangpu River is Shanghai, the economic and transportation center of the whole country.</p>
<p>The prosperity of Shanghai is needless to say. The crowded markets and the shoulder-to-shoulder pedestrians, these two phrases are enough to summarize it. Because of this prosperity, most people only like sunny days and dislike windy and rainy days, which hinder their outings. If you find something like "appreciating the rain at Huxin Pavilion," "listening to the rain at the racecourse," "watching the rain on the Huangpu River" in literature, that's in the poetry collection of a self-proclaimed writer, but it's not the common psychology of ordinary Shanghai people. Especially on Saturday afternoons and all day Sunday, it is forbidden for the heavens to rain; if it rains, curses are inevitable.</p>
<p>Here's a joke: One year, it seemed like the heavens had a grudge against Shanghai people. Every Saturday afternoon, it would drizzle, and by Monday morning, the rain would clear and the clouds would dissipate. This happened for a dozen weeks in a row. Someone even suggested: "The heavens know the leisure days of Shanghai people, so why not change Wednesday to Sunday, so that the week-long anticipation of fun is not hindered by wind and rain." Although this never became a reality, it shows how much Shanghai people hate rainy days.</p>
<p>However, the heavens don't care whether you like it or hate it. If it wants to rain, no one can stop it. It was a cold day at the end of the year, and it was raining again. First, dark clouds gathered, then a gust of cold wind blew, and the raindrops went from sparse to dense, from small to large, constantly falling from the sky over Shanghai. At this time, the No. 6 streetcar was heading east from the North Railway Station, passing over the Waibaidu Bridge, and proceeding along the Bund. At each stop, the carriage spit out a few men and women who mustered up the courage to brave the rain, and sucked in a few men and women who had already been blown and battered by the wind and rain. Looking down suddenly at the wooden-slat floor of the carriage, it became a few small rivers. A young student, Ye Weicheng, sitting upright, had a trace of anxiety on his handsome face. He rubbed the glass window with the back of his hand, trying to see what the scenery outside was like. But it didn't work. The thin mist inside the window was wiped away, but the outside was still blocked by raindrops. It was a white blur, and even the outline of the steamship in the Huangpu River could not be seen.</p>
<h3>Mei Xi Secretly Leaves Shanghai - Bai Yun and Shangguan Yunzhu Accompany Him</h3>
<p>— Tai Xu</p>
<p>After "Mulan Joins the Army," Mei Xi's position in the Guolian Company was naturally the "leading man." At that time, he was assigned so many roles that he almost had the difficulty of being in two places at once. But soon, Mei Xi's position was replaced by Liu Qiong and Gu Yelu, and perhaps the founding of the Lianxing Company was for this reason. However, the Pacific war caused his "Autumn Only" to fail. With more free time, his spending also increased sharply. It was rumored that Mei Xi had a lot of savings, but in reality, it wasn't so. So, on the night of New Year's Eve, Mei Xi secretly left Shanghai.</p>
<p>Guolian Company received a letter from Mei Xi's wife, requesting the company to consider their years of service and lend 500 gold to get through the year. This further proves that Mei Xi's private savings were "unexpectedly" spent.</p>
<p>It is said that Mei Xi's destination is Qingdao, accompanied by Bai Yun, Shangguan Yunzhu, Meng Na, Zhou Chu, etc. Based on this "lineup," it is likely that they are going to Qingdao to perform "Autumn Wind Opera." If this guess is correct, then the plays performed will probably be "Thunderstorm" and "Sunrise," etc. "Original Plays."</p>
<p>With so many big stars as a gimmick, "some harvest" is no problem. However, if the admiration of inland ladies for big stars unfortunately has the same style as Shanghai's "devoted loyalty," then the results of the "harvest" cannot be predicted.</p>
<h3>Nothing Shown on the Silver Screen</h3>
<p>— Yi Qing</p>
<p>In "Dream of Beijing", performed by LaFayette, a cellar scene is needed in the play, but there is no way to install it on the stage, so the space under the stage is used. LaFayette's stage is originally open above and below.</p>
<p>In "Chu Overlord" at Lanxin, a Russian was specially employed to manage the lighting. In the last scene of Wujiang Suicide, moving clouds were projected with a magic lantern, which was quite novel and beautiful.</p>
<p>Gu Yelu, Zhang Fan, and others will be invited to make guest appearances in Carl Deng's upcoming performance of "The Strange Man of Zhongliu."</p>
