<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c1">情報與輿論 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>情報與輿論，都是政府的耳目，用以作爲決定一國政策和施政辦法乏參攷的。不過，情報是由政府成立相當廣泛而嚴密的組織，依照一定約計劃，向民間搜集各方面的言行動態而報吿於政府當局。輿論則爲各方面民衆依藉有形的（如報紙雜誌等）及無形的（如口頭的傳述等）以發表其對於政治和現實環境的喜·怒·哀·怨的情緒，提出各種希望與要求。所以，一般的說，民閒的輿論，是最眞實的，是最不容輕視的。相反，政府的情報，則因爲是指定某些特殊人物去搜求的，不免耳目有所不過，能力有所不逮，利害有所朦蔽，是非有所不實，因此，所得情報的準確性，往往和實際情形相反，爲政者如果昧然以爲施政的準繩，往往會收到極壞的後果。所以我們檢閱古今中外的歷史事實，凡是良好的，賢明的政府，一定重視輿論，視輿論的向背，以爲施政的準繩，因此，這個政府的政策，一定獲得全國民衆的擁護，政府賴以鞏固，國家也賴以安全。反之，違反王道精神的政府，就不重視輿論，反轉是畏懼輿論，那時就只重視情報了，於是黑白不分，是非顚倒，良善忠信者盡成仇讐，而脅肩諂笑之徒，禍國殃民之輩，乃得安富尊榮，而天下危岌，國事不足以有爲了。</p>
<p>我們並不是說情報根本要不得，不，情報有情報的用處，特別是在這國性的大戰中，不僅自己要設法獲得敵方的情報，而且還要防制敵方對我的刺探。不過，工作有它在時間和空間的種種限制，特別是中國，不要說日本在華當局，就是中國自已的當局，實施情報工作，也不得不認眞注意這種限制。主要的是：第一，中國一向是崇尙王道之治的，情報工作向不重視，不僅一般人民沒有這種知識，就是當局也一向不了解情報的眞實意義。因此，在中國就不容易物色到完全適合的情報員。如果對於情報員的任務沒有正確認識的人去充當情報員，其危險性實在有不敢設想者。其次，中國人民在儒敎精神數千年的浸潤之下，向以「隱惡揚善」爲正人君子做人的起碼道德；相反的，一班趨炎附勢的小人，他們根本不知道「道德」爲何物，惟知自私自利，只要有助於自己利祿的增加，便不惜誣良陷善。一方面是善人不問世事，一方面是惡人恣意作孽，君子道窮，小人升騰，千百年來中國政治的腐敗黑暗，癥結所在，或卽在此。所以，在這樣一個社會裏實施情報工作，就不能不特別提高自己的警戒心，因爲一不當心，就會供給壞人作惡的機會，而對於工作本身毫無益處。</p>
<p>過於重視情報工作而結果造成政府當局與民間之仇恨，慶政椎就是最明顯的例子。重慶政權爲了重視情報工作，控制民間輿論，曾經建立了嚴密的情報體系，和特務機構，不僅在各省市地方遍佈情報網。情報網之嚴密，可謂無以復加了，每一個人民一聽釗「情報「特務」二字，莫不談虎色變，然而，結果如何？首先是造成了民間普遍的恐怖心理，增加了人民對政府的不了解和怨恨，其次是一切政府的和民間的機關團體，爲了情報和特務網的存在，而鬆懈了本位工作，大家敷衍塞責，惟恐一認眞工作，就成爲情報員的目標。第三，是由於情報員的嫉賢忌能，多數振作有爲的政府幹部和各界專門人才，都被挾誣入獄及寃死，剩下爲政府工作的只是些唯唯否否的庸材和脅肩諂笑的奴才。第四，由於情報人員具有超越一切的權力，他們常常利用機會，營私舞弊，陷害忠良，從這裏可見情報工作的誤用，收釗的是怎樣嚴重的惡果。</p>
<p>在中國實行情報工作，對於重慶政權這種慘敗的情形和所食的惡果，是不能不鄭重加以注意的。我們認爲目前日本在華當局特別應當檢討一下情報工作的實情和結果，而特別要重視的（一）是一切情報工作人員，必須要選擇其人格健全，有學識，有道德；只有經過嚴格的選擇，才能保證他在工作中的效果。（二）一切情報工作人員必須經過充分的政治訓練，使對於一般政治形勢和自己的任務有充分的認識，特別是對自巳道德和人格具有信念，對於自己工作具有高尙的感覺。（三）由於中國的特殊情形，對於每一情報，必須以充分的時間去判別其正確的程度，且不可一得情報，就信以爲眞，率然出之以行動，因爲「寧枉母縱」的政策，重慶政權早已實行過而且慘敗了。（四）對於依據認定正確的情報，而對中國人或其集團實行檢舉與逮捕時，必須力避株連無辜，而且迅速加以合法的審判。（五）對於不實的情報的來源者，應予以反坐的嚴格處分。此外，認眞實行「不咎旣往」的政策，凡是某種情報涉及某人或某集團過去的思想與行動的，縱使認爲正確，亦應不予處理。這種寬大的政策，直接固然於中國人民有利，可是間接也幫助了日本自己。</p>
<p>除了對於情報工作這些必要的注意以外，我們竭誠希望日本當局適應中國的歷史環境和現實情形，不作「情報萬能」的觀念，注意民間的輿論，抹植民問的輿論，一反重慶政權的箝制政策，開放善意的批評和民情的抒發。因爲只有民間輿論，才是政府最忠實的耳目：只有眞正的民間輿論，才能補充情報所不及和補救情報的弊端，即幫助良好政策的推行。</p>

<h3 id="c2">漫談突尼西亞之戰　譯自十二月二十一日大阪新聞 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>（問）所羅門在東，突尼西亞在西，一般人認爲這是目　世界職面之二大重點。請問北非戰局到底如何？</p>
<p>（答）已登陸的美軍，有七個師十四萬衆，陸續從阿爾及爾，和里比亞各港，英美軍仍在開拔前來，所以，傾主力攻突尼西亞的美英軍總數，果然應當是相當可觀的。和這對應着，德義軸心軍不斷地把戰車和步兵向突尼西亞輸送，同時從西西里，撒丁島，陸續有新兵增援，國境附近各要點已充分配置就緒，在和法守備軍協力之下，佈成一鐵壁似的防禦陣地，正花和美英軍展開大規模的遭遇戰。當然，現在正在所謂一進一退之際，離到達決定綫還遠着，但歐洲大戰，頗有已將重點移置于此之觀呢。</p>
<p>（問）我有些擔心：軸心國在這裏不是逐漸被拉進艱苦的「短期消耗戰」了麼？請問尊見</p>
<p>（答）對手旣爲美國，這恐怕是不免的吧。在埃及，美國已設立了裝置工廠，飛機一大批在造出來。在西部非洲什麼地方，戰機工廠也設立了。總之，他們傾全力于物質力和生產力之昂揚，打算在「物」的比賽上使德義不戰自敗。另一方面，現在美英軍的兵站綫，因爲延綿太長之故，不斷地受着德空軍集中猛炸，自美國來的裝送其輸送船也時時受到軸心潛艇的奇襲，所以，美英軍可說是已逢到了絕大的難關。但是，德義方面也未許樂觀。美英爲求握得地中海制海權，是不惜任何犧牲的，他們沾沾自喜的，正就是要在歐洲大陸築成第二戰錢。軸心方面，疏忽和偷閒，都是大忌事。</p>
<p>（問）一般人把這叫做第二戰綫，但是，斯達林在革命紀念日不是說「第二戰綫僅限于歐洲大陸」，而把北非爲第二戰綫之說加以否定了麼？</p>
<p>（答）美國在登陸當初，也曾聲明「這不是第二戰綫」，但不管羅斯福多麼狡滑，結果還是發表了「那就是第二戰綫」之類的話。這之間，美英是相當用了一番心思的。就是說，假使把這叫做第二戰綫，對蘇聯就比較地好說話了。說是這樣說，其實却完全是美英帝國主義的侵略。也就是：羅斯福要在這裏實現他朝夕夢想着的猶太經濟帝國主義。最近有人謠傳猶太帝國要建設在這里，無風不起浪，這可能是有所根據的。</p>
<p>（問）特戈爾和達朗二政權，處境相同，目標相同，應該是互相合作的，而今竟然齟齬起來，其原因恐怕就在這里吧。</p>
<p>（答）是的。露骨地說，美國的傀儡政府是達朗（譯者按達朗現已被刺殞命）政權，英國最初加以控制的却是特戈爾政權，因此，就煽動特戈爾派起來反對達朗政權。由此可以窺見美英在北非政治工作上的對立。</p>
<p>（問）這樣傾軋頻起之間，由於軸心軍的猛炸，敵人的登陸軍和增援軍都將一一被殲滅了。是麼？</p>
<p>（答）和法守備軍並肩作戰着，這樣的戰果，一定會完成的。今後，就將漸次走入長期戰了。（惠譯）</p>

<p>首相報吿各地戰况大意如下在過去一年間、日陸軍之戰况可劃爲前後兩期、前期即攻陷香港、新加坡及柯勒基陀等以及敉平爪哇。菲島·及緬甸等地之閃電戰、後期則作戰更呈執拗强鞭之決戰態勢而進入正軌作戰、敵軍雖屢戰屢敗、猶恃其豐富之物力擴充軍備、企圖克復吾南方各佔領地、並增强在渝空軍兵力、反攻所羅門新幾內亞及阿留申羣島等、故如細加一觀察、則具有重大意義之作戰、續在各方面展開中</p>
<p>（一）南方各地</p>
<p>首就緬甸而言、自下即度方面敵軍及印軍陸上兵力共的白萬人、飛機的六百架、且似續有增强之勢、緬甸日陸軍不僅在西部國境與敵接觸、在東北方面怒江一帶、亦與渝軍十餘師相對峙、英美空軍又時以東部印度及雲南爲根據地、連日以飛機十數架來襲、日軍已艇次將其擊退、並以戰鬬機及轟炸機之聯合大編隊攻擊敵根據地、予以重創十月廿五日日空軍襲印緬國境西部之琴伐加及吉大港等地、會擊落敵機四十餘架、又十二月五日及十日復猛襲吉大港、擊燬敵機十餘架、擊沉敵船二十餘艘、並向車站及軍事設施投下巨彈、十五十六兩日父攻擊吉大港及芬尼兩機鄉、擊燬敵機二十餘架、本月二十日以來、並數度空襲加爾各答、獲預期以上之戰果、一方面緬甸治安自新行政機關成立後益趨良好、緬甸所組織之緬甸防衛軍亦已完成、日實力甚强、在越南·菲島·馬來·爪哇·蘇門答臘·婆羅洲各方面日軍各部隊、除菲島方面有一部份尙在進行討伐作戰外、其他各地治安均已確保、所羅門羣島方面日海軍少數部隊所佔領之爪達爾卡納爾島、於本年八月上旬美軍大舉登陸、日陸軍即與海軍堅密協力、實行登陸、並克服一切運輸·登陸給養·及衞生上之各種困難、刻亦與敵軍對峙作戰中、該方面敵軍具有空軍根據地、故日軍之登陸及海上運輸決非容易、但仍能展開陸海一體之作戰、</p>
<p>（二）中國方面</p>
<p>日駐華派遺軍在全中國構成綿長戰綫、對渝軍三白萬共軍六十萬隨時展開殲滅戰、摧毀其戰力、並確保各地治安、其主要爲華中方面之浙贛作戰、及華南華北蒙疆之各地作戰、共作戰决數實達二百五十次、日軍所截獲之軍需品及其他戰果實甚巨大、以言在渝之美空軍及渝方殘存空軍、共約有飛機三百架、自六月以還、在華北華中華南各地展開游擊戰、但我方受損極輕、日軍又屢次　減浙閩兩省渝空軍根據地或反覆襲擊渝方移動空軍根據地、予以重大打擊、壓制其蠢動、故在渝美空軍目下已逃避不敢與日航空部隊作戰、</p>
<p>（三）北方地區</p>
<p>阿留申　島為敵軍一重要進攻　、本年六月八日日陸海兩軍在協力作戰之下、分在西部數島相繼登陸、確保各地壓制其進攻、至於滿洲方而亦日夜在防衞警戒中、並進行積極訓練、俾在變幻無常之世界情勢下固守北方、奠完遂大東亞戰爭之基礎於磐石、</p>
<p>（四）經濟開發</p>
<p>南方佔領地軍政現在順利進展中、行政機構概已整備完成、並續派必要人員先後前往、刻正屐開具之軍政建設、各地住民均深明日本眞意、對掙脫英美荷桎梏建設大東亞新秩序之意義、頗爲感激、願與日本同甘共苦協力合作、至於經濟開發、以獲得國防上重要之資源爲目標、重要物資之開發、前受戰火破壞者大部業已恢復、此於增强日軍戰力裨益甚鉅、如汽油·鐵礬土·鐵礦·鎢礦·錫礦等資源、均已有極大收穫、又銅礦鉛礦等亦均已達到日本物姿動員所期待之生產數量、至於農林姿源、南方實爲世人共知之世界寳庫、不僅糧食產量足供大東亞全體之需要、即橡皮·奎寗麻·梅木馬尼刺麻·及椰子等之生產量、在世界市塲上海有獨佔之地位、關於物資運輸則已盡量利用陸軍微用船、計截止十月底止、已運物姿數量共達一百八十餘萬噸、一年中可望超出預定墩量之十七倍云、</p>
<p>以上乃佔領各區軍政機關轄下悄勢之一般叙述、軍事·政府與平民各方咸需傾其全力、互作最密切之合作、日本帝國陸軍於過去一年戰爭中所獲綜合戰果及其所受損折、已由帝國大本營於十二月七日公布、故今日無庸詳述、東條首相之報吿末稱、「余茲願剴切而言者、日本陸軍在皇威之下、與海軍嚴密合作、並得日帝國一億人民之熱誠聲援、已確立必獲最後勝利之戰略地位、」</p>

<p>（十一月廿六日）東亞經濟懇談會，得日滿華蒙各地域會員，其他民間有力的經濟家，以及政府有關官員等五百餘名之參加，自廿六日起，互三日間，在東京丸之內大東亞會館內舉行第四次大會。大會第一日，即廿六日，自上午八時起，由新會長小倉正恒氏致開會詞，日本本部長藤山愛一郞，滿洲本部長馮涵淸，華中本部長陳紹嬀，華北木部長　泉蓀，業疆木部長宗像久敬，分別作會務報吿。接着，舉行評議員八十名的增員選舉。上午九時半，舉行開會式。由東條首相致祝詞。下午的會程，有靑木大東亞相之「關於大東亞經濟建設」，賀屋箴相乏「關於大東亞經濟建設的理念」等演講。繼之，滿洲國經濟部大臣阮振鐸，華北政務委員會實業總署督辦王蔭泰，關於各地域經濟建設，作了詳盡的報吿。到了下午五時，第一日會務就此終了。</p>
<p>靑木大東亞相演詞</p>
<p>（前略）關於大東亞經濟建設方策，前經附設於內閣的大東亞建設審議會加以周密檢討後，業已向政府答覆過了。政府對這答覆頗爲心許，即以此爲基凖，而有種種施策。茲將內容簡述如次：</p>
<p>第一，大東亞經濟建設，以道義爲立脚點，謀建設大東亞之經濟新秩序，並貢獻於新世界經濟之建設。這是根據所謂八絃一宇的我國傳統精神而成的，和美，英，荷蘭等國對東洋的殖民地政策，寳有著本質的差異。因此，大東亞各國的住民，必須使他們各盡其力，各得其所，要做到這一步，就得互相提携，向共同的理想前進。第二，必須發揮各地域人力及資源乏經性，綜合地充實大東亞全體之經濟力，完成以帝國爲中心的大東亞防衛所必需之自主國防經濟。爲了在大東亞的世界經濟範圍內築成一優越地位，同時爲了確保大東亞地域內各國的生存，使各國國民得以安居樂業，這將是惟一的方法。第三，目前建設工作的重點，必須放在戰爭遂行力之急速增强上。大東亞戰爭若不獲勝，一切理想和希望都將歸於泡影。我們應知，大東亞各國及其住民是共運命的，「兄弟閱於墻」，那樣的對立觀念，絕對不允許有。必須一致協力，共謀綜合戰力之增强。</p>
<p>在上面所述的理念之下，我皇國舉國家之全力，以圖大東亞戰爭之完成，並爲大東亞建設面努力。政府之所以設置大東亞省，就是要使中央及現地，在一元性的機構下，迅速適當地處置大東亞建設的各事項。</p>
<p>其次，關於經濟建設的具體方策，想加以概要的說明：</p>
<p>第一，有關農林業及水畜產業的方策。大東亞各地域人口之大多數都在從事農林水畜產業，所以這一點是特別需要重視的。皇國所必需的重要食糧，通過日滿合作，可保自給自足。食糧不足的地方，可由他地域供給。在目前戰時，固有運輸上種種不便，尙不能期以十分的圓滿，但這只是一時的現象，隨着將來根本對策之樹立，問題就會解決的。</p>
<p>關於林業對策，目前重點必須放在軍需及生產力擴充所必要的資材乏供給及確保上。因此，南方森林資源之開發，特別是被期待着的。</p>
<p>水產業方面，相應於各地域之特性，期能供給並確保水產物，準備冷藏，冷凍，加工等設施，而謀水產業之綜合的發展。又畜業方面，和供給及確保畜產食糧的同時，羊毛，毛皮，毛革等之生產擴充，亦爲當務之急。</p>
<p>纖維資源方面，相應於各地域之特性，期能綜合地開發並利用棉花，麻類，蠶絲類，羊毛，織維原料等各種資源。尤其中國之棉花增產，大家寄與極大的期望，希望關係各方面特別加以注意。</p>
<p>此外，砂　，橡皮，規那，麻栗樹等南方特產物，足供共榮圈之需要而有餘，這些必須加以科學的利用，俾在世界經濟上得確保大東亞之優位。</p>
<p>其次，有關鏞工業的方策。其重點必須放在戰爭遂行力之增强，戰時生活之確保，以及將來產業發展之基礎之確立等等上面。進一步而圖大東亞產業之飛躍的發展，及大東亞民生之暢達。照目前的情勢看來，重點非放在鋼鐵，煤，石油，其他液體燃料，銅，鋁，航空機，船舶，肥料，電力等之建設上不可。所以，爲貫澈此目的，共榮圈內之勞力，輸送力，資材，資金，必須盡可能她集中起來，加以活用。又，關於國防產業，基礎產業等，戰力增强上必不可缺的隆業部門，爲要通過大東亞全域而强化其有機的連擊，皇國必須對其建設運營加以統轄，關於民生產業及其他產業，一方面力求經營之自主性，另一方面，現地開發所必要之技術者及勞動者，必須盡可能地求之於現地住民之協力。</p>
<p>調查了資源的現存狀態，作主要產業的現地計劃大約如次：</p>
<p>（甲）製鐵事業，其新規擴充之重點，放在滿洲及華北。</p>
<p>（乙）煤鑛業，主要的在華北，滿洲，寳行劃期的開發。至原料煤，「發生爐用煤」等特殊的煤，則通過各地域，實行重點的增產。</p>
<p>（丙）天然石油的　發，傾主力於南力，人迭石油事業則以滿州，樺太，北海道及華北爲中心，期以加强的擴充。</p>
<p>（丁）鋁工業，在目前，以朝鮮及滿州爲中心，將來可向華北及南方推行擴充。</p>
<p>（戊）纖維工業，暫限於一定範圍，以後應諸般情勢之變化，再遂次向共榮圈地域推行擴充。</p>
<p>（己）皇國特別着重精密工業，機械工業，兵器工業等高度工業之發展。</p>
<p>（庚）電力的開發，和國防計劃，產業開發計劃相呼應，企圖以水力發　爲主，綜合地，計劃地加以實施。</p>
<p>再次，有關交通的對策。把目前大東亞經濟建設之難關，統歸之於輸送二字，亦不爲過言。爲將各地豐富的物資迅速予以輸送，船舶、鐵道、汽車、航空業等等，非充分活用其機能及特性，交通全般的綜合能率，非最高度地予以發揮不可。同時，在日本海，柬中國海，南中國海等領域，必須造成一以日本爲核心的强有力的交通圈，並使之成爲大東亞內海一樣的東西。在滿州，中國及蒙古等大陸圈，在南方其他的海洋圈，必須適應各自的地位，確立產業上所必要的交通情勢，以圖更進而使這成爲對全世界交通發展之前進基地。</p>
<p>要之，爲完成目前的大東亞戰爭及强有力的經濟建設，在上述的各經濟部門，痛感有綜合地，計劃地加以施策之必要。</p>
<p>現在，大東亞建設邁着巨步，在進行着。除蒸蒸日上的我皇國之外，一心一德和皇國結合着的滿州國，也在迎接建國十周年，產業及經濟各分野都已有長足的進展；此外，中華民國還都南京二年有餘，因頑迷的重慶政權還在抗戰着，戰火至今未熄，但其政治的滲透力甚大，所以，經濟的復興及建設都在着着進行，在與日本同甘共苦的精神下，對大東亞建設有着極大的貢獻。</p>
<p>再則，我國與暹羅，安南的提携，特別是經濟方面—日益密接起來，在南方的廣大的新佔領地上，更確保了號稱世界獨一的寳庫，適應各地域特性之不同，積極地在從事開發及建設等活動，也就是說，大東亞經濟建設早已豪壯地出發了。然而，大東亞戰爭方興未艾，大東亞建設還是非常艱苦的。爲了打勝這長期戰，完成建設的大業，一方面固有賴於皇國一萬萬國民的奮鬥努力，同時，共榮圈各國及其住民的提携合作，也是不可少的。</p>
<p>結局，現下諸問題的解決，就端賴協力二字。這所謂協力，就指的是：以大東亞各國及其住民的運命共同感爲基礎，相互對對手方的立塲予以正確的理解，共謀國家開政策見解之一致。</p>
<p>然而，爲圓滑實現此協力關係計，單靠國家間意見的合致，還是不行的，還得通過各國民間業務上的接觸及其日常生活，而謀眞正的親善融合。以上所說，不僅是理論，而且是我最近在外勤務中所得的一個結論，一個信念。至於新設大東亞省的運命，我總想，爲求大東亞各國及其住民之相互提携而以全力赴之。在這意味上，東亞經濟　談會對日、滿、華三國的意見溝通及協力之具現，是有極大貢獻的：我希望在目前大戰的緊張中，這次大會把任務更向前推進，對大東亞建設作更進一步的發揮，以期澈底完成懇談會之目的。</p>
<p>賀屋藏相演講</p>
<p>（前略）諸般方策中，特別是關於貿易、金融、財政等問題，擬簡述如次：</p>
<p>皇軍的赫赫戰果，使共榮圈資源頓時加多了不少，但有效適切的活用，則尙視圈內外計劃的交易之遂如伺而定。</p>
<p>大東亞的物資交換，志在完成大東亞戰爭，增强國力，也就是以大東亞共榮圈之確立並發展爲目的，實施以日本爲核心的高度計劃交易。因此，一方面，和業已決定的大東亞各地產業立地計劃相呼應，設定綜合的交易計劃，同時，以迅速適確爲第一要旨，和匯兌物價，關稅，交易機構等各般施策相關聯，對此計劃綜合地加以調整，也是必要的。</p>
<p>至於金融方面，一言以蔽之，就是以日圓爲中心的大柬亞金融圈之確立問題。大東亞圈內各地域相互間的決算，必須依照日圓，以日本銀行爲中心，綜合一體地加以執行。同時，圈內各地域的通貨，必須以日圓爲其價値基凖及發行基礎，圈內各地域的發券機構，必須在日本銀行裏立有日圓的往來賬目，準此　執行相互間的決算，這一層固不待言，就是對圈外的決算，也得如此。因此，圈內各地域通貨對日圓的兌換率，必須公正地加以核定，俾使大柬亞物資勞力等綜合計剖得以有效地完成。同時，各地域的物價，通貨價値，必須安定下來，俾使大東亞全體的生產增强，物資交流，勞務調度，得以圖層地進行，國防經濟力也得日臻隆盛。</p>
<p>其次，關於財政方面，希望圈內各地域能自行負　各自的軍事設施費，產業開發費等，以檣財政之獨立，同時，必須爲財政負擔之相互調整而努力。所謂財政負　之相互調整，不外就是財政上「各盡所能協力及負擔之理念」而已。就是說，大東亞共榮圈內各地域必須自覺「大東亞之確立維持及發展」此一崇高的一元普遍的共同目的，爲達成此目的，並須積極地盡其所能來貢獻自己的一分力量。同時，就消極方面說，必須亘古長時期，有大犧牲之決心，爲達成上述的目的，各組成昌各自發揮其特色，盡其所能來協力並負擔一切。總之，這就是以大東亞全體同甘共苦爲其特色的一個大覺醒遝動。基於上述的理念，國內各地域的歲出，必須把重點放在用以確立並發展綜合的國防力及經濟力的許多施策上，以圖民生之安定向上。在歲入方面，通過各地域，必須沾在公正的基準上，盡可能地施行簡素制度，特別是，依照各地域情形，民智程度之不同，而考慮其稅收種類之選擇。對各地尤不可律以公式的劃一主義。關於各地域的公債發行，和金融旋　相呼應，必須基於綜合約計劃而施行統制，依照各地城實情之不同，用適當的方法，確保其財政需要資金之源源接濟。</p>
<p>以上，關於大東亞經濟建設的若干方策，已講述了個大概。當然，這樣的大事業決不是一朝一夕所能辦到。在實施的當時，不妨分爲若平時間的階段。同時，各地域帶着各自的特色，也不是可以律以同等的方策及規則的。然而，最重要的一點是，到最後，必須有機地和綜合地，以日本為核心，而一元化起來。</p>

<p>— （綠蒲我生）</p>
<p>本市兩租界及滬西南市等地，有舉辦保甲及實施自警團站崗網後，恐怖减少，宵小潛蹤，地方治安，日臻安謐，不特一般市民得以安居樂業，即社會秩序，亦爲之井然不紊，此皆由於各保甲當局指導有方，及各自警團員均能洞悉保甲意義與本身關係，故能樂於努力本位工作所由致也，然而木市幅員廣闊，人口繁多，事務紛繁，莫此　甚，關於一切保甲興革事項，自必踵接而起，第以保甲當局，袞袞諸公，統籌兼顧，高瞻遠矚，洞見癖微，自必游刃有餘，固毋席饒舌，但本人爲自警團員之一份子，對於服務社會，維持地方治安，固亦負有一部份責任，一得之愚，未敢緘默，因此小辭謝陋，對於保甲興革事項，列舉如下，以爲蒭蕘之獻，謹將鄙見，臚列於后：</p>
<p>（甲）於保甲委員會者：（一）籌備　　　行，查本市保甲組織，　　偉大，應興應革，端賴經濟以爲推動，似宜級織一統一金融機關，（卽保甲銀行）以資便利，同時並鼓勵各級工作人員及自警團員等儲蓄，以養成節的儉樸之風；（二）設立保甲醫院，以利各級工作人員及自　團　家屬等，於遇有疾病時，得享受義務醫治之權利；（三）設立保甲義學，以作育人材，查本市自受戰後影響，物價奇昂，普通人家，日常生活，已感困難，遑論子女敎育，須知敎育事業，爲百年大計，作育人材，亦爲當務之急，但為一般家　清寒，無力負擔子女教育之保甲各級工作人員及自警團員計，則保甲義學似有亟於設立之必要；（四）籌辦保甲日刋，以利宣傳。同時對於社會一般輿情，自更融治。其他關於一切保甲法令及各種消息，更可廣爲傳播，不至隔膜，並須在各區保街頭佈告牌及崗亭附近之適宜　點，每日張貼一份，使婦孺咸知，則收效更大（五）舉辦職介紹，設立失業登記，量才介紹，擇尤錄用，使一般失業團員，得以解決此種痛苦，而安心於其本位之工作，則保甲效率，自必大見增加也。</p>
<p>（乙）屬終各區聯保辦事處者：（一）添設禦寒棉褸及防雨雨衣，按自警團員中，不少淸貧階級，禦寒服用，多感不足，每當更闌午夜，風雨交加時，體力羸弱者，不易支持，故審情度勢，則棉褸雨衣之設，似亦爲當務之急，（二）添設値夜電筒，以利工作，（三）設立意見箱，以期溝通輿情，（四）警鈴鑰匙保管人姓名住址，應在警鈴觸目之處標明，同時並在該保管人所在地作同樣之標明；（五）保甲長本人辦事處，（商店或住宅）應在門首觸目之處改用木牌標明，以資識別。惟不可用紙書寫以防易於脫落：（六）加派暗查按班考勤，如發覺團員有犯規者，先予警吿，再犯記過，累犯的予處罰。反之，如有團員在服務時期，精神煥發，工作認眞者，應先加以精神之獎勵，次而記功，累功酌予嘉獎，以鼓勵團員精神之振作；（七）任意禮貌，如一般過路人之問路時，須以溫和態度出；（八）訂定團員服務細則，並印在查崗冊上及在崗亭內標明，以便遵守；（九）崗亭內之垃圾，必須按日淸理，同時並禁止瓜皮菓殼及痰涕等物隨意擲吐，以保消潔而重衛生；（十）各團員臂章及號帶等如有陳壞者，須隨時更換，以莊觀瞻；（十一）各團員間有因職務關係，對於站崗時刻有衝突時，應准予酌量調班，以免影響職務。</p>
<p>綜上所述，係就一般普通的而言，對於列舉事項，雖間有已經舉辦者，但亦有尙未舉辦者，請予分別加以酌辦，以臻完善，管見所及，的略言之，還祈保甲諸君指正爲幸。</p>

<h3 id="c51">船舶戰爭　對談 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>海軍造船中將　永村清</p>
<p>前東京高等商船學校校長　須川邦彥</p>
<p>朝日週刊記者</p>
<p>譯自十二月二十七日朝日週刊</p>
<p>記者：這樣的大戰爭，無論站在那方面來說，決不　只有武力戰一種，而是在表現着各樣的戰爭的面貌，其最顯著的，就是所謂船舶戰爭。今天想在拜聆兩位關於這方面的話。</p>
<p>自從本年七月下旬，到十月下旬爲止，根據歷次爲日本海軍潛艇所擊沈的船舶的發表看來，固然把敵船擊沈了不少，然而日本的犧牲，也相當重大，這個由於潛艇　擊的損失，總沒有方法防止嗎？</p>
<p>永村：美國游擊戰中所用的武器，是潛艇和飛機。講到潛艇，最先用於戰爭中的，乃是上次的世界大戰，那時德國利用這種新武器，破壞通商，得到很好的成績，爲名國海軍所承認。就是英國，對它也不敢不另眼看待。而海軍元帥澤力科（Jellicoe）等，則對於將來的潛艇戰，還深抱着憂懼。所以德國對於使用潛艇一道，是非常發達的；面其對於潛艇的防禦方法，也有相當的研究。到了這决戰爭，比起上次的戰爭來，潛艇的防禦方法和攻擊方法，已經達到了劃時期的進步。又利用其他力面的科學進步，例如利用超短波無綫電以探知潛艇的所在等的方法，也發達了。所以，攻勢和防禦，兩者是緊緊地追趕着的。因爲兩力都進步，所以潛艇的游擊戰也跟着發展。</p>
<p>記者：拿德國擊沈敵船的數目看來，每月差不多有一百萬噸。所以，鑒於船舶沈失於被潛艇襲擊一事，愈覺有多多建造的必要吧。</p>
<p>永村：建造是一個辦法，不使沈失也是一個辦法。</p>
<p>須川：講到不使沈失的辦法，有攻擊和防禦，以及探知潛艇所在等的方法。然而現在敵人拚命地進行着的游擊戰，它的對象　什麼呢？結局不外是商船吧，木用說，軍艦也是它的目標，可是軍艦有着完全的防備。例如小型驅潛艇，即是爲要打擊潛艇而造成的。所以潛艇只好把防禦力很小的商船，拿來做目標了</p>
<p>然而用商船來載運貨物，在戰爭中是少不了的。它載運的是極重要的資材，或國民生活所不可缺少的必需品。所以，從二十幾年前的第一次歐　大戰以來，若能把商船一艘一艘擊沈，就能把敵人打倒，已成爲常識的追理了。商船這樣東西，換句話說，就是海上輸送這件事，要想得到戰爭的勝利，是決不可以缺少的。船舶是左右一國命運的東西，這話在這次的戰爭裏，更加顯得確實。所以，軸心國的海軍或航空機，每月要擊沈百萬噸以上的船，也是爲了這個目的。我對於戰術，雖然不是個專門家，可是對於德國不必在英國本土登陸作戰，只要使英國的船舶保有噸數减少到某一個噸數以下時，就能使英國吃敗仗，這個道理，倒是很明白的。因此，他們在加緊地把它擊沈哩；</p>
<p>對付潛艇的戰術有種種</p>
<p>所以，商船也採用了種種的防禦方法，如所謂船圑航行，把許多船集在一起，使有力的艦隊跟着，保護他們航行，就是一種防禦方法。然而這個方法，在上决的歐洲戰爭裏，並不顯得怎樣有力。那時僅由軍艦一艘保護着許多武裝的商船航行而已，可是現在則已改用　偉的艦隊來護航了。不過，敵人游擊戰的目標，倒是在於單獨航行中的商船。爲避免被襲　起見，商船也已裝備了某種的武裝，不過和軍艦的武裝比起來，那是談不上的。因此，敵人就把它來做龔擊的目標。最近大本營發表有二十幾艘日本的船被破壞了，想來也是被這種游擊着想，除了急速發見敵人之外，沒有別的辦法候，則魚雷通過的路上，有水泡在海面浮起，成為「條白綫奔了過來。等到發見了這白綫而知道有魚雷射來的時候，方綫可知有潛艇跟着了。所以除了急速發見敵人，而用自己裝著的大砲轟射敵人以外，沒有別的辦法。現在已有靠着這個方法打擊敵人的例子，又躲避魚雷的辦法也有，因為魚雷是拖着白綫奔了過來的，所以只要趕快轉軸動船舵，也可以躲避，又若潛艇浮出於海面，也可以用大砲來轟射它，不過對方的身體很小，這邊則很大，而對方也不會浮出來給你看見。</p>
<p>所以，從規在美國的游擊　看來，不能不認爲日本沿岸，到處都有着敵人存在。因此船不管是在日本的海港，或遙遠的南方，或其他的海港，一旦駛出海港，就不得不感覺到有敵人的潛艇潛在水裏，或裝設着機械水雷，或浮在水面。所以，商船上的人，不管是船員或船客，實是冒着非常危險而航海着的。</p>
<p>記者：使船的本身雖遇潛艇　來亦不懼怕，例如建造具有相當速力的船，這種辦法，亦可加以考慮嗎？是非常必要的事。這不但在防禦上說來是很好</p>
<p>永村：不用說，把商船的速力弄得極快是非常必要的事。這不但在防禦上說來是很好的辦法，而日是一種攻擊力哩。不過把商船充分武裝，使有充分的防禦力，則商船便要變成軍艦了。也許大砲缺少了幾尊，然而總會變成和軍艦差不多的。這樣一來，輸送力就要大大是辦法，然而迅速發見敵人，則是最重要的。</p>
<p>須川：迅速發見敵人自是必要的。同樣，自己不給敵人發見，也是必要的。言雖是肖極的辦法，可是二十幾年前的歐洲戰爭裏，已經有不使商船冒出烟來的例子了。所以有「餘烟是得禍之因「這句話，烟在水平錢上，即使是細細的冒一條出着，也會給人知道有船駛來了。所以在有潛艇盤踞着的危險的海面上，日間不用烟煤來燒，而改用無烟煤來燒的。這是不使敵人早速發見的一種辦法。還有帆檣也是討厭的東西，因爲它高高　伸出於船上，　遠遠地方就可望得見。水平綫上即使有一根像毛那樣的帆檣可以看見，就可知道有船駛來J。因此也有把很長的帆檣，截成短短的。烟囪也是如此。又把艙頂上部的構造物改成小而低矮，也是這個道理。者是不使還處的敵人發見的手段。至於夜間，則採用燈火管制的辦法。即把船上的燈火完全熄滅，在黑暗中進行也有因爲稍微漏出來的一點火光，而被擊沉的船哩。例如，有一個人在艙面上吸紙烟，紙烟的火雖是很小和螢火差不多，然而因此竟中了魚雷而沉沒了。的確有過那樣的船。</p>
<p>偽裝問題</p>
<p>還有一個方決，就是不用無綫電。用無綫電是極危險的，發出去的無綫電是要被人家聽見的，這正和大聲說話要被附近的人聽見一樣。船上如有無綫電放出去，只要裝有無綫電機械的船，都可聽見。一聽見之後，用方向探知機來查察，就可探知所在。還有船上不可大聲說話，也不可以打鐘。避免這些事價，就是商船的一毬自衛。還有把油類和垃圾等能浮在海面的東西丟在海裏，也很危險。尤其是在許多船集在一起航行時，如把這些東西丟在海裏，則這些油和垃圾等就跟着船走，拖成長長的帶，於是自己走過的足跡便留在海面，可以給敵人立刻發見，所以凡是可以焚燒的垃圾，就要在夜裏把它燒掉，不能焚燒的，便用錘打得結結實實投入海底。這種辦法，是必須加以考慮的。其次，便是速力的問題，可是這實在就是船的武器。拿陸地來比方，潛艇的游擊戰，好像是曠野裏走着的人被野狗追襲一樣，所以若那人跑得快，就可以逃脫；若跑不快，就要被狗咬咧。</p>
<p>在第一次歐洲戰爭，到了中期，已經有一千五百萬噸的船被擊沉。根據那時所作的統計，大概速力在十二海里左右的船，被敵發見而終得逃脫和終被擊沉的，約各居半數。而速力在六海里左右的船，則百分之百被擊沉。至於速力在十八海里以上的船，則其被擊沉的僅佔百分之三，其餘都逃出了危險。又因先發見敵人或被敵人先發見而得逃出危險，或逃不出危險這一點，在那個統計裏，大體也曾發表出來。所以速力就是武器這句話，是說得不錯的。</p>
<p>其次，還有偽裝問題。所謂僞裝問題，就是把船施以迷彩或改變船的構造物的辦法，在前次的戰爭裏，已經有了相當的研究。例如，日本的船博多丸」，也曾有過僞裝的事。當時會在船後向船頭盡了一條粗綫，好像上向的箭狀，這樣在眞正的船頭後面，盡了一條錢之後，看起來便像是船頭了。因此，潛艇在夜間弄錯了方向，以爲是向着逆的方向進行，就放出魚霄射來，因而得免於難、這似乎有點滑糟吧，又在大船的橫腹上，畫一隻驅逐艦，使從遠處看來，好像旁邊有隻驅逐艦護衛着一樣，這種僞裝的例子，也曾有過。</p>
<p>彈在反向的舷裏穿出</p>
<p>永村：剛繼所說迷彩的話，那邊也是拚着命的，因此，看錯的也很多。還有在潛艇不能到達的綫海裏航行，也是一種方法。又日間航到潛艇不能潛入的淺海或陸地相　的地方去，夜間再到危險的地方去航行，也是一種方法。此外，還有種種方法，然而用這些消極的方法，只不過防術自己而已。進一步的方法，則是用大砲來矗舉。又在極近的距離內遇到敵人時，而已經毫無辦法的時候，則惟有自沉。最近也有過這種實例、今年四月裏，有一艘〇〇丸，就在傍晚時候自沉了。那時潛艇浮着，發射了魚雷，而〇〇丸則避開魚雷而自沉了。其次還有反而把防禦力弄得很　而謀逃避的方法。例如在日俄戰爭裏，佐渡丸即因此得救。當時該船的右舷被擊中一彈，却在左舷穿出了。那顆炸彈剛巧打在煤會裏，因爲單已穿出，水同時從兩舷進入，因此得平平直直地沉下，這樣便得救了。原來炸藥的力，被其磁着的東西愈堅强，愈能發揮其猛力，碰着的東西若愈脆弱，則像和弱者比力一樣，愈能簡簡單單的了事。</p>
<p>須川：其次，來講瞭望的話吧，這是非常緊張的瞭望。而這所謂瞭望，不只指眼的瞭望而已，乃是利用人的五官……儘可能還要利用到第六感哩。當須這樣地去瞭望前後左右，近年還須瞭望天空，而且必須是水裏，水面和天空的立體的瞭望，所以是非常緊張的。</p>
<p>又在上次的歐洲戰爭裏，對於海面的鷗羣，也會非常注意。大家曉得鷗是跟隨着鯨或鷗羣的。鯨為呑食鳁魚及其他小動物而追游着，所以有鳁魚的地方，必有鯨在，有鯨的地方，也有鳥在的。而且鷗看”了潛艇也要跟隨的，因此有許多鷗羣聚着的地方，說不定有潛艇隱匿着。像這樣利用海上動物的習性於戰爭中的例子，也有不少呢。下面所述的，便是上次歐洲戰爭巾的一個故事。</p>
<p>那時　濟某一個國家，會使用着海驢。海驢是海豹的）種，把它訓練馴熟後，就可使用。在訓練時，不給餌食，使其肚裏飢餓，而在靠近海岸的地方，把潛艇椗泊着，使海驢看着，於是把潛艇的引擎開動，發出「隆隆」的聲音，在這個時候，就用餌餵給海驢，使其知道在潛艇的引擎開動時候，便有餌可得。其次把潛艇開到遠離海岸的地方，海驢則留在陸地，於是再來開動潛艇的引擎。這樣一來，海驢聽見引擎聲音，就以爲有餌可得了，立即跳入海裏，游到潛艇那邊云了，游到後就給以餌。再次，把潛艇潛入水裏，把海驢用小汽艇艇載着，海驢的體上則用紅色像紙烟那樣大小的浮木繋着。等到潛艇開動引擎潛去時，海　聽一聽到聲音，便又立刻跳入海裏，向着潛航着潛航着的潛艇游去，小汽艇則隨着海驢的浮木追着。用那樣的方法把海驢來訓練，利用海驢本能的聽覺，使自尋潛艇的所在，等到潛艇的所在知道後，便把海驢牽上，然後用炸雷射去，那樣的方法曾經有過。</p>
<p>不可輕視的美國的造船</p>
<p>記者：雖然有了那些防禦的方法，然而結局仍不能不受到潛艇所加的相當損害，那末，所謂船舶戰爭，不得不被正式採用了。據說美國年造八百萬噸的船舶，有這樣的可能性嗎？</p>
<p>永村：是不是確實，倒不知道。不過美國所謂八百萬噸，是指死重（Dead　Weightht）而言，而被擊沈的，則是用噸數米表示的，所以建造的噸數，當比被擊沈的噸數多。兩相比較看來，應該把建造的噸數打一個七折計算。所以所謂建造八百萬噸，實際不能不看作六百萬噸以內。不過，他們是在想怎樣地盡力來建造，倒是無可疑的。　（未完）</p>

<p>— 穆文</p>
<p>會吃淡飯的人大概不多，還得吃些小菜下飯，不論小菜多寡好壞。</p>
<p>單用淸水燒菜似乎也不大好，還得用些油；爲了色彩和調味的需要，更得加些糖。上海人吃小菜，尤其喜歡肥，喜歡甜。所以燒小菜就省不了油與糖（我們這裏不討論營養）。</p>
<p>目前在上海買油買糖都得軋，軋不到怎麼辦呢？有錢的人有辦法。猪油可以自由購買，生的熟的都有，二十幾塊錢一斤。可是葷油燒菜不及素油肥，而且冷了要凝凍，素油仍然非用不可。聽一位朋友談起，一家人家從秘密市塲裏買到素油五十斤，每斤價二十五元，合計一千二百五十元！至於糖，二房東可以拿了房捐票一次購得四十元，分不分給房客另有辦法。再不然，也許還有辦法買得到車糖。只苦惱了那些還可以勉强吃頓把飯，吃樣把小菜的人家，主婦燒菜沒有油也沒有糖，只好望着鍋子歎氣。至於連飯也沒得吃的八，油糖倒索興已成了憂愁不到的問題。</p>
<p>新近却從那些善於打算的朋友那裏得到了有趣的經騐：他們用油條炒菜，用山芋和入麵粉做餅，就那麼揩揩油水，嘗嘗甜頭（純吃山芋又當別論）。窮朋友眞也有他們的窮打算！</p>

<p>雖然每天早晨從東方升起來的太陽，還是和昨天的一樣，幾千萬年來從來沒有改變過形勢，然而你不能因為他的模樣不會改變，就不能承認這是新的一天，而不撕下你的日歷。</p>
<p>日曆一頁一頁的撕過去，撕過去，撕完了一本又是一本。從鴻濛開闢到現在不知已撕完多少本的日曆了。現在，掛在壁上的三十一年度的日曆又將撕完，只剩下薄薄的幾頁了。丹桂飄杳，菊黃蟹肥的時候，一霎眼已經過去了。彷佛人生之道上的路標，很快地已經很到遠處去，愈遠愈小，終於看不見了。擋在面前的正是北風凛冽，天寒地凍的歲盡隆冬</p>
<p>對着十二月，這歲尾，你將發生如何的感想呢，也許你會發出一什麼，一年又過完了嗎？」的嘆息，而對於歲月的匆匆，發生無限感慨。你覺得這一年眞是虛度，無論在那一方面，都沒有收穫和長足的進步。而歲月逼人，轉眼又將馬齒徒增了。也許你看着這殘餘的日曆，會懶洋洋地什麼事都打不起精神來做。「隨他吧！反正一年就要過完了，有什麼事就留到來年再做好了。在這短短的時間裏，也做不出什麼事來。</p>
<p>我們在每一時期的開始，，總是緊精會神地去應付的。不過卽使在終了的時候，也不應該有一分鬆懈，是月也，一方面讓我們反省一下這一年來的所爲，以作下一年的借鏡；方面也讓我們定好來年約計劃，以便一開了年就脚踏實地的去做。</p>
<p>情形正有如一張電影名片的獻映一樣，無論誰都要談談這片中的情節和主角的演技。要是有誰不知道，他就不能被稱爲時髦人物。但名片的獻映，只能引起一部份人的欣賞和注意。有許多人是甘居於不時髦之列而置之不聞不問的，而現在談論米的問題的時髦性，是勝電影傑作多多了。這種盛况，眞是空前的，從這種空前的盛况中，可以看出米的問題是如何嚴重了。尤其踏進了這個月以後，米價在漲無已。加上油，糖的買不到，眞叫上海人難於生活了。</p>
<p>最束手無策的，當然是那一班窮人。在生活的高壓下，他們早已奄奄一息了，如何再禁得起寒意的襲擊？飢火煎心，朔風刺骨，宛轉呻吟着，易一晨昏，如歷年歲的可憐蟲，馬路上觸目皆是，我不信他們都是前世不修的人，這些瑟瑟作戰，嗷嗷待哺的人，那一個不是我們的姊妹弟兄？我們誼屬同胞，豈忍見死不救？唉！「安得廣厦千萬間，大庇天下寒士盡歡顏！」杜甫雖然有那樣的心腸，但沒有那樣的力量，也屬徒然。現在社會上有這個力量的人，想來一定不少，誰肯本己飢己溺之心，推普渡普濟之願呢？眞不勝馨香祝禱之至啊！</p>
<p>是月也，自然界裏寂無生氣，沒有桃李的穠華，沒有牡丹芍藥的妍艷，沒有蓮的淸新，沒有菊的韻逸；就是梅的暗香也還沒有消息。我們爲什麼不將我們的同情和愛隨時撒種，隨時灌溉，使牠在風寒冰凍，霜零木脫的十二月中，抽苗茁芽，吐出芳芬嬌美的花來呢，（　酬轉助學金）</p>

<p>烟台，多麼富於象徵意味的名兒！在這裏，天公不喜下雨，但愛刮風。靜坐斗室中，細聽猴啼虎吼般的松濤，就如被百獸包圍，令人毛骨悚然。淸晨徘徊斜坡上，眼前呈現着的，好像西洋鏡的變化萬千。薄霧籠罩着睡眼惺忪的高山，浮雲密佈遼闊無邊的蒼海，醉了的在風，摟着黃沙飛舞，孤傲的烟突，從嘴裏吐出嬝娜的黑魔，在天上排成長蛇。烟，雲，霧，沙，打成了一片灰色的世界。</p>
<p>劉公島，質樸豪遇，悲壯沈雄：芝罘山，讀麗婉的，淸柔曲折。洗沙旺的黃沙，賽過大戈壁，四村的櫻花，無異世外桃源。嫵媚的烟台山，遙望着巍峨的烟台山，彷彿美人英雄，相映成趣。稱爲最高學府的燜台中學，獨據毓璜頂的峯巔，似有目空一切，不可一世的氣概。</p>

<p>— Lincoln　Schuster　古心譯</p>
<p>—世界著名科學家的書翰之一—</p>
<p>一八五九年十月十五日，達爾文從約克郡（Vorkshire）寫信給赫胥黎（ThomasHuxley）說：「我現在在這裏用水治療着，在我完成了那本被咒詛的書（種源論）之後，又重生了，這木書對於別人，也許是容易的工作，但對於我，却幾乎丟了我半條命。…我一些也不敢要你相信我許多的邪說。」</p>
<p>最後，在一八五九年，達爾文劃時代的傑作，到底在一八五九年出世了，書名是「由於自然選擇的種源」（On　theOrigin　of　Specoes　byMeans　of　Natnral　Selection)或稱『生活競爭中適宜種族的保存』（Preservation　of　Favoured　Races　in　the　Stiuggle　ofLife)。該書初版一千二百五十冊，在出版的一天就賣完。</p>
<p>在下列的信中，我們可以略略看出達爾文一切工作中的考察。檢定。和創造性的思想。</p>
<p>「決意發表人類來源的小小論文……」</p>
<p>本文</p>
<p>我所親愛的華萊士，——培次（Bates）是很對的：你正是別人遭了困難向你就商的人。除了你的意見（註）以外，我沒有聽見過更加智巧的意見，我希望你能够證明其眞實。講到白蛾的事實，非常動人，看見一種學說差不多要被證明時，眞會使人的血溫暖起來。關於雄蝴蝶所以美麗的話，我還是要想，這是爲性的選擇。蜻蜓全被鮮明的色彩所吸引，也有着某種證據；不過使人發生上述的信仰的，乃是許多直翅類和蟬類的動物都有音樂的器官。爲了這樣，所以我也相信烏類在性的選擇上，其情形也正和蟲類的色彩一樣。我希望我有氣力與工夫，會作你所想示的幾種實騐，但我想蝴蝶是不能够拘留起來的。我確實聽見過這樣的困難。許多年以前，我有一尾塗着燦爛顏色的蜻蜓，但是我却從來沒有機會好好地試騐牠。</p>
<p>現在我對於性的選擇感覺着很大的興趣，其原因是我差不多已經決定，要發表一篇小小的論文，講到人類的來源，並且我仍管理堅强地想（雖然我不能使你相信，而這一點對於我簡直是最重允的可能打擊），性的選擇是形成人類種族的主動者。</p>
<p>順便再說，此處還有一個主題，我要介紹到我的論文中去，那就是面容的表示。現在，由於偶然的機會，你會不會知道馬來海中有一個很和善的，精明的觀察家，對於馬來人被谷種情緒激勁時的面貌，你想誰會給我一些便利的意見呢？假使有這樣的人，我要送給他一張問題表。我謝謝你給我的最有趣的信。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Information and Public Opinion <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Both information and public opinion serve as the eyes and ears of the government, used as references for deciding national policies and implementing measures. However, information is gathered by the government through a relatively extensive and rigorous organization, according to a certain plan, collecting reports on various aspects of people's words, actions, and movements from the public to the government authorities. Public opinion, on the other hand, is the expression by various segments of the population, through tangible means (such as newspapers and magazines) and intangible means (such as oral transmission), of their emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, and resentment toward politics and the real environment, and the presentation of various hopes and demands. Therefore, generally speaking, public opinion is the most genuine and should not be taken lightly. Conversely, government information, because it is gathered by designated special individuals, inevitably has limitations in perception, ability, obscured interests, and untruthful judgments. As a result, the accuracy of the information obtained often contradicts the actual situation. If policymakers blindly take it as a guiding principle for implementing policies, it often leads to extremely bad consequences. Therefore, when we review historical facts from ancient times to the present, both in China and abroad, all good and enlightened governments value public opinion and regard the support or opposition of public opinion as a guiding principle for implementing policies. As a result, the policies of such governments inevitably gain the support of the entire nation, the government is consolidated, and the country is secured. Conversely, governments that violate the spirit of benevolent governance do not value public opinion but instead fear it. At that time, they only value information, and as a result, right and wrong are indistinguishable, good and evil are reversed, and virtuous and loyal people become enemies, while sycophantic and flattering individuals, those who harm the country and the people, are able to live in peace, wealth, and honor, and the country is in danger, making it impossible to achieve anything.</p>
<p>We are not saying that information is entirely unnecessary. No, information has its uses, especially in this great war involving national characteristics. Not only should we find ways to obtain information about the enemy, but we must also prevent the enemy from spying on us. However, the work has various limitations in time and space, especially in China. Not to mention the Japanese authorities in China, even the Chinese authorities themselves must pay serious attention to these limitations when implementing intelligence work. The main points are: First, China has always advocated the rule of benevolence, and intelligence work has not been valued. Not only do ordinary people lack this knowledge, but the authorities have also never understood the true meaning of intelligence. Therefore, it is not easy to find fully suitable intelligence officers in China. If those who do not have a correct understanding of the duties of an intelligence officer serve as intelligence officers, the danger is truly unimaginable. Second, under the influence of Confucianism for thousands of years, the Chinese people have always regarded "concealing evil and promoting good" as the minimum moral standard for upright gentlemen. Conversely, a group of sycophantic petty people do not know what "morality" is at all and only know how to be selfish and self-serving. As long as it helps to increase their own interests and benefits, they will not hesitate to slander the good and entrap the virtuous. On the one hand, good people do not care about worldly affairs, and on the other hand, evil people wantonly commit sins. Gentlemen are in despair, and petty people rise. The root cause of the corruption and darkness of Chinese politics for thousands of years may lie in this. Therefore, when implementing intelligence work in such a society, one must particularly heighten one's vigilance because if one is not careful, one will provide bad people with opportunities to do evil, which is of no benefit to the work itself.</p>
<p>Overly valuing intelligence work and ultimately creating hatred between the government authorities and the people is most clearly exemplified by the Chongqing regime. In order to value intelligence work and control public opinion, the Chongqing regime established a strict intelligence system and secret service organization, spreading intelligence networks not only in various provinces and cities. The strictness of the intelligence network can be said to be unparalleled. Every person who hears the words "intelligence" and "secret service" turns pale at the mention of them. However, what was the result? First, it created widespread fear among the people, increasing their misunderstanding and resentment towards the government. Second, all government and civilian organizations, due to the existence of intelligence and secret service networks, relaxed their own work, and everyone perfunctorily tried to avoid responsibility, fearing that if they worked seriously, they would become targets of intelligence officers. Third, due to the jealousy and hatred of talent by intelligence officers, most of the energetic and promising government cadres and experts from all walks of life were framed, imprisoned, and unjustly died, leaving only mediocre people who said "yes" to everything and slaves who flattered and fawned on the government. Fourth, because intelligence personnel had powers that surpassed everything, they often took advantage of opportunities to engage in corruption, bribery, and harm the loyal and good. From this, it can be seen what serious consequences result from the misuse of intelligence work.</p>
<p>When implementing intelligence work in China, the disastrous defeat of the Chongqing regime and the evil consequences it suffered must be given serious attention. We believe that the Japanese authorities in China should seriously review the actual situation and results of intelligence work, and what should be particularly valued is: (1) All intelligence personnel must be selected for their sound character, knowledge, and morality. Only through strict selection can the effectiveness of their work be guaranteed. (2) All intelligence personnel must undergo thorough political training so that they have a full understanding of the general political situation and their own tasks, especially a belief in their own morality and character, and a noble feeling for their work. (3) Due to the special circumstances of China, each piece of intelligence must be given sufficient time to judge its degree of accuracy, and it is not permissible to believe it to be true as soon as it is obtained and act on it rashly, because the policy of "rather wrong than let go" has already been implemented by the Chongqing regime and has been disastrously defeated. (4) When conducting investigations and arrests of Chinese people or their groups based on intelligence that is determined to be accurate, it is necessary to avoid implicating the innocent as much as possible and to promptly conduct legal trials. (5) Those who provide false intelligence should be severely punished. In addition, the policy of "no blame for past offenses" should be seriously implemented. If a certain piece of intelligence involves a certain person's or group's past thoughts and actions, even if it is considered accurate, it should not be dealt with. This lenient policy is directly beneficial to the Chinese people and indirectly helps Japan itself.</p>
<p>In addition to these necessary attentions for intelligence work, we sincerely hope that the Japanese authorities will adapt to China's historical environment and current situation, not adopt the concept of "intelligence is omnipotent," pay attention to public opinion, cultivate public opinion among the people, reverse the Chongqing regime's policy of suppression, and open up benign criticism and the expression of public sentiment. Because only public opinion is the most loyal ears and eyes of the government, only genuine public opinion can supplement what intelligence does not cover and remedy the drawbacks of intelligence, thereby helping the implementation of good policies.</p>
<p>Translation of Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e2">A Casual Discussion on the Tunisian War Translated from the Osaka News of December 21st <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Question) Solomon is in the East, Tunisia is in the West, and most people think that these are the two major focal points facing the world. What is the situation of the North African war?</p>
<p>(Answer) The American troops that have landed have seven divisions, a total of 140,000 men, and are continuously arriving from Algiers and various ports in Libya. British and American troops are still setting off. Therefore, the total number of American and British troops attacking Tunisia with all their strength should indeed be quite considerable. In response to this, the German-Italian Axis forces are constantly transporting tanks and infantry to Tunisia. At the same time, reinforcements are continuously arriving from Sicily and Sardinia. Various key points near the border have been fully deployed, and in cooperation with the French garrison, a defensive position like an iron wall has been formed, and a large-scale encounter battle with the American and British forces is unfolding. Of course, it is currently in a so-called advance-and-retreat phase, far from reaching the decisive line, but there is a view that the focus of the European War has shifted here.</p>
<p>(Question) I am a little worried: Aren't the Axis countries gradually being drawn into a difficult "short-term war of attrition" here? What is your opinion?</p>
<p>(Answer) Since the opponent is the United States, this is probably inevitable. In Egypt, the United States has set up equipment factories, and a large number of aircraft are being manufactured. Somewhere in West Africa, aircraft factories have also been established. In short, they are devoting all their efforts to promoting material strength and productivity, intending to defeat Germany and Italy without a fight in the "competition of things." On the other hand, the American and British army's supply lines are constantly being bombed by the concentrated German air force because they are too long, and transport ships from the United States are also constantly being attacked by Axis submarines, so the American and British armies can be said to have encountered great difficulties. However, the German and Italian sides are also not allowed to be optimistic. The United States and Britain are willing to make any sacrifices in order to seize control of the Mediterranean Sea. What they are complacent about is building a second front on the European continent. Negligence and relaxation are great taboos for the Axis powers.</p>
<p>(Question) People generally call this the second front, but didn't Stalin say on Revolution Day that "the second front is limited to the European continent," and deny the notion of North Africa as the second front?</p>
<p>(Answer) The United States also stated when it landed that "this is not the second front," but no matter how cunning Roosevelt is, he eventually announced something like "that is the second front." In the meantime, the United States and Britain put in a lot of thought. That is to say, if this is called the second front, it is easier to talk to the Soviet Union. That being said, it is actually a complete invasion by American and British imperialism. That is: Roosevelt wants to realize his long-cherished dream of a Jewish economic empire here. Recently, there have been rumors that a Jewish empire is to be built here. No wind makes no waves, and this may be based on something.</p>
<p>(Question) The Tergol and Darlan regimes have the same situation and the same goals, and should cooperate with each other, but now they are actually disagreeing. The reason is probably here.</p>
<p>(Answer) Yes. To put it bluntly, the American puppet government is the Darlan regime (Translator's note: Darlan has now been assassinated), while the British initially controlled the Tergol regime. Therefore, they incited the Tergol faction to oppose the Darlan regime. From this, we can see the opposition between the United States and Britain in North African political work.</p>
<p>(Question) With such infighting occurring frequently, the landing and reinforcement troops of the enemy will be annihilated one by one due to the fierce bombing of the Axis forces. Is that so?</p>
<p>(Answer) Working side by side with the French garrison, such a battle result will definitely be achieved. In the future, it will gradually enter a long-term war. (Translated by Hui)</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Propaganda Department Issued a Communiqué Chairman Wang Returned to the Capital He Made a Speech Expressing His Deep Gratitude for Japan's Preferential Treatment Further Development of Cooperation in the War <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency) The Propaganda Department issued a communiqué at 4:00 PM on the 27th as follows: "On the 19th of this month, Chairman Wang went to Japan and consulted with the authorities of friendly countries on the current situation in his capacity as President of the Executive Yuan. He returned to the capital this afternoon and made a speech as follows: 'Since arriving in Tokyo, I have been deeply grateful for the preferential treatment of the friendly country's imperial family and the hospitality of all sectors of society. Regarding the current situation, I have had several earnest talks with the officials of the government authorities. Our opinions are harmonious, and there has been further development in strengthening the National Government and cooperating in the Greater East Asia War. I am deeply gratified.'"</p>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) Since the Chairman and President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government arrived in Japan on the 20th, he paid a visit to His Majesty the Emperor on the 22nd. He then exchanged opinions with Prime Minister Tojo on consecutive days, and everything went quite smoothly. At 10:00 AM on the 26th, he and his entourage took a special aircraft, the Haiyan, from the airport here to return to the country. Prime Minister Tojo and other ministers attended the opening ceremony of the 81st Diet on the morning of the same day, so they all went to the guesthouse in the morning before Chairman Wang set off to see him off. Others who went to the airport to see him off included Vice Minister Kimura of the Ministry of the Army, Vice Minister Matsumoto of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Director Yamamoto of the Greater East Asia Ministry, Heiji Chikiichiro, Ambassador Shigemitsu to China, newly appointed Ambassador to Italy Hidaka, Director-General of Aviation Dohihara, and our country's Ambassador to Japan Xu.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency) Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the situation in East Asia has rapidly unfolded, and the foundation for victory has also been laid. In order to directly exchange opinions with the Japanese government authorities, strengthen the National Government, and complete the Greater East Asia War, the Chairman and President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, accompanied by Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance Zhou Fohai and other entourage members, took the Haiyan special aircraft to Japan at 10:00 AM on the 19th of this month. After arriving in Japan, he paid a visit to the Japanese Emperor on the 22nd. From the 23rd onwards, he met with Prime Minister Tojo and ministers of the Army, Navy, Foreign Affairs, and Greater East Asia, as well as various other parties from the government and the public, in his capacity as President of the Executive Yuan. He exchanged opinions with various parties on issues such as close cooperation between China and Japan and achieved satisfactory results. Therefore, at 10:30 AM on the 27th, he returned to Nanjing from Fukuoka on the Haiyan special aircraft. At 3:40 PM, he safely arrived at the capital's airport. The ministers of various yuan who arrived to welcome him at the time included Wen Zongyao, Jiang Kanghu, Chen Qun, Chen Chunpu, Chen Junhui, Xu Suzhou, Su Chengde, Deng Zuyu, Ren Yuandao, Ye Peng, and foreign guests, including Ambassador Lu Ronghuan of Manchukuo, Ambassador Starmer of Germany, a representative of the Italian Ambassador, and Chief of Staff Kawato of Japan, totaling over a hundred people. At 3:30 PM, the silhouette of the aircraft was seen appearing in the eastern sky. The welcoming personnel at the scene all smiled and craned their necks in anticipation. A moment later, the dark green Haiyan aircraft flew to the top of the sky and circled over the airport for a week before slowly landing at 3:40 PM. The welcoming personnel immediately raised their hats to welcome him. Then, the aircraft door opened, and the Chairman, dressed in a black formal suit and full of vigor, slowly descended from the aircraft amidst the loud military music. Entourage members Chu Minyi, Lin Baisheng, Xiao Shuxuan, Zhou Longxiang, Chen Changzu, and Navy Advisor Teraoka followed suit. After getting off the aircraft, the Chairman smiled and nodded frequently to the welcomers. At 3:50 PM, the Chairman and all the entourage members finally took a car back to their residences to rest.</p>
<p>Fukuoka, 27th (Central News Agency) The Chairman and President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government went to Japan on the 20th and exchanged opinions with the Japanese government authorities for consecutive days. On the morning of the 26th, he left Tokyo with his entourage members Chu Minyi, Lin Baisheng, Xiao Shuyi, Chen Changzu, and others, as well as the military advisor of the National Government, Navy Rear Admiral Teraoka, on a special aircraft. After spending one night in Fukuoka en route, he safely arrived in Nanjing at 3:40 PM on the 27th.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 27th (Domei News Agency) After Chairman Wang's visit to Japan and return to the country, it is heard that the National Government is now re-adjusting its administrative and military organs in accordance with the basic policy of cooperation with Japan and conducting the Greater East Asia War. Regarding this matter, Chairman Wang's visit to Tokyo this time can be said to be a turning point for closer cooperation between China and Japan in carrying out the war. Judging from the current situation, it is not difficult to imagine that the National Government will adjust its military and political organs based on the complete unity of all political parties. According to political observers here, the specific adjustment plan will be drafted by Minister of Finance Zhou Fohai and Minister Mei Siping. It is expected that this reorganization will expand to political and economic aspects, with three goals: to strengthen the administrative power of the National Government, increase productivity, and raise the standard of wartime life for the Chinese people. The adjustment plan is expected to affect China's financial institutions, the rural pacification movement, national policy companies, and the utilization of enemy-managed factories.</p>
<p>Minister Lin and Others Express Their Thoughts on Chairman Wang's Visit to Japan</p>
<p>Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency) After Chairman Wang returned to Beijing on the afternoon of the 27th, Minister Lin of the Propaganda Department and Information Minister Yofu of the Japanese Embassy specially held a joint reception for Chinese and foreign journalists at the Propaganda Department's press room to express their thoughts on Chairman Wang's visit to Japan.</p>
<p>Minister Lin said in his speech that he accompanied the Chairman to Japan this time and had expressed his feelings, which were published in the newspapers. He also had something to tell you all. Today is December 27th, and the day after tomorrow is the 29th, which is the fourth anniversary of the Telegraphic Message. On the occasion of the fourth anniversary of this Telegraphic Message, the guiding force of the Telegraphic Message has made the situation develop further. Not only is He Yun's comrade pleased, but he will also work even harder to lead the people of the country to endure hardship and strive to realize their own goals. Some of you may ask where the so-called development of the situation lies. I solemnly tell you, the iron front formed by the East Asian people and East Asian comrades has become stronger and stronger. The great power exerted by this strong front will allow us to witness the final destruction of the enemies of East Asia and the final annihilation of the rebels of East Asia in the 32nd year of the Republic of China. We hold this spirit to celebrate the fourth anniversary of the Telegraphic Message and the 32nd year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Information Minister Yofu of the Japanese Embassy in Nanjing gave a speech at the Propaganda Department on the 27th after Chairman Wang returned from Japan and met with reporters. Chairman Wang was pleased to return from Japan this time. This visit by the Chairman has made the relationship between China and Japan closer and more cooperative, and is moving towards the path of completing the Greater East Asia War. What kind of assistance has Yufang recently given to the United States and Britain to make various necessary struggles? And what has the United States and Britain shown to them? This is really a great insult to China by Yufang. The Chinese will demand that the United States revise the immigration law containing anti-Chinese connotations, but the result is rejected. The United States incorporates Chinese people into the army and sends them to the front lines in Europe and the South Pacific to fight, using the blood and flesh of the Chinese people to exchange for their own delusions of victory. During the First World War, the Americans incorporated Chinese people into the army and sent them to the European battlefield. Britain also organized the Indian army and falsely promised to give the Indians independence and freedom after the war as a price. But at the beginning of the war, they needed the Indians, and now they have turned a blind eye to India's independence. Now, the most cruel thing that Britain does is to use all kinds of inhumane and forceful suppression against the Indian independence movement. This time, the United States is driving the Chinese to fight, and is giving them a blank check as a reward, allowing them to revise the immigration law after the war. Britain's tactics against India are really poisonous. Britain puts the Yujun in the front line on the Burmese front, so the corpses abandoned on the battlefield are all Chinese. This kind of fact is still in the deep memory of the world. It is impossible to make countries with such different races and civilizations cooperate with each other. Even if they cooperate for a while, it is only for their own interests, and there is no possibility of permanence. It is gratifying that China and Japan, with the same script and the same race, are moving towards the common goal of protecting East Asia in a natural posture. Looking back at Yufang's repeated exploitation by the United States and Britain, we feel even more that the path of cooperation between China and Japan is correct and beyond doubt.</p>

<h3 id="e5">The Greater East Asia War Now Enters Its Second Stage - Japanese Prime Minister Addresses Parliament on the War Situation, Hoping the Entire Nation Will Exert Greater Effort <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Domei News Agency) - Prime Minister Tojo, in his capacity as Minister of the Army, addressed both houses of the Imperial Diet this afternoon, stating that the first stage of the Greater East Asia War, characterized by lightning-fast surprise attacks, has now passed and become a protracted affair. The enemy, initially suffering bitter defeats, is now striving to reorganize its military strength. Their apparent plan involves recapturing Japanese-occupied territories, increasing their air force stationed in China, and launching counter-offensives in the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, and the Aleutian Islands. Close observation reveals that extremely important strategies are taking shape in various locations, creating the impression that "the real war will now begin."</p>
<p>The Prime Minister reported on the war situation in various regions, outlining that the Japanese Army's operations over the past year can be divided into two phases. The first phase involved lightning warfare resulting in the capture of Hong Kong, Singapore, Corregidor, and the pacification of Java, the Philippines, and Burma. The latter phase saw the fighting become more stubborn and intense, entering a phase of full-scale combat. Despite repeated defeats, the enemy relies on its abundant material resources to expand its military strength, attempting to recover our southern occupied territories, strengthen its air force in Chongqing, and counter-attack in the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, and the Aleutian Islands. Therefore, close observation reveals that operations of great significance continue to unfold in various aspects.</p>
<p>(1) Southern Regions</p>
<p>Regarding Burma, the enemy has a total of 100,000 troops, including those from British India, and 600 aircraft, with the strength seemingly continuing to increase. The Japanese Army in Burma is not only in contact with the enemy on the western border, but also confronting over ten divisions of the Chongqing army in the Nujiang River area in the northeast. The British and American air forces, using eastern India and Yunnan as bases, attack daily with dozens of aircraft, but the Japanese army has repeatedly repelled them. Joint large formations of fighters and bombers have attacked enemy bases, inflicting heavy damage. On October 25th, the Japanese air force attacked Chimgaga and Chittagong in the western Burmese-Indian border region, shooting down over forty enemy aircraft. On December 5th and 10th, they again launched a fierce attack on Chittagong, destroying over ten enemy aircraft, sinking over twenty enemy ships, and dropping heavy bombs on stations and military facilities. On the 15th and 16th, they attacked Chittagong and Feni airfield, destroying over twenty enemy aircraft. Since the 20th of this month, they have also repeatedly bombed Calcutta, achieving results exceeding expectations. Meanwhile, security in Burma has improved since the establishment of the new administrative agencies, and the Burmese Defense Army, organized by Burma, has been completed. Japanese strength is very strong. In Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaya, Java, Sumatra, and Borneo, Japanese units, except for a portion in the Philippines still engaged in suppression operations, have secured peace and order. In the Solomon Islands, the small Japanese naval units that occupied Guadalcanal Island were heavily attacked by the US military in early August of this year. The Japanese army immediately cooperated closely with the navy, implementing landings and overcoming all kinds of difficulties in transportation, landing supplies, and sanitation. They are currently confronting enemy forces. The enemy forces in that area have air bases, making Japanese landings and maritime transport not easy, but they are still able to conduct integrated land and sea operations.</p>
<p>(2) China Front</p>
<p>The Japanese Expeditionary Force in China has constructed a long front throughout China, launching annihilation warfare against three million Chongqing troops and six hundred thousand communist troops at any time, destroying their combat power, and ensuring peace and order in various places. The main operations include the Zhejiang-Jiangxi operation in Central China, as well as operations in various regions of South China, North China, and Inner Mongolia. The total number of operations reached 250. The military supplies and other war spoils captured by the Japanese army are substantial. Regarding the US Air Force in Chongqing and the remaining Chongqing air force, they have a total of about 300 aircraft. Since June, they have been conducting guerrilla warfare in North China, Central China, and South China, but our side has suffered very little damage. The Japanese army has also repeatedly reduced the Chongqing air force bases in Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, or repeatedly attacked the mobile air bases of the Chongqing side, inflicting heavy blows and suppressing their movements. Therefore, the US Air Force in Chongqing is now avoiding fighting the Japanese Air Force.</p>
<p>(3) Northern Region</p>
<p>The Aleutian Islands are an important enemy offensive point. On June 8th of this year, the Japanese army and navy, in cooperation, landed successively on several islands in the western region, securing those locations and suppressing their attacks. As for Manchuria, they are also on guard day and night, conducting active training, in order to solidify the north amidst the ever-changing world situation, and lay the foundation for the complete prosecution of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>(4) Economic Development</p>
<p>Military administration in the southern occupied territories is now progressing smoothly. Administrative agencies have been generally established, and necessary personnel have been continuously dispatched. They are currently launching the military administration and construction. The residents of various places deeply understand Japan's true intentions and are grateful for the meaning of breaking free from the shackles of Britain, America, and the Netherlands to build a new order in Greater East Asia. They are willing to share weal and woe with Japan and cooperate. As for economic development, the goal is to obtain important resources for national defense. Most of the important resources that were destroyed by the war have been restored, which is of great benefit to enhancing the combat power of the Japanese army. Resources such as gasoline, bauxite, iron ore, tungsten ore, and tin ore have already yielded great gains. The production of copper and lead mines has also reached the production quantities expected by Japan's resource mobilization. As for agricultural and forestry resources, the South is a world-renowned treasure trove, not only producing enough food to meet the needs of the entire Greater East Asia, but also having a monopoly on the production of rubber, quinine, Manila hemp, and coconuts in the world market. Regarding the transportation of materials, they have made every effort to use army transport vessels. By the end of October, the total amount of materials transported had reached more than 1.8 million tons, and it is expected to exceed the planned tonnage by seventeen times within a year.</p>
<p>The above is a general description of the situation under the jurisdiction of the military administration agencies in various occupied areas. The military, government, and civilians need to devote their full efforts and cooperate most closely with each other. The overall results of the war and the damage suffered by the Imperial Japanese Army in the past year of the war have been announced by the Imperial General Headquarters on December 7th, so there is no need to elaborate today. Prime Minister Tojo concluded his report by saying, "I would like to sincerely state that the Japanese Army, under the Emperor's authority, is cooperating closely with the Navy and receiving the enthusiastic support of the 100 million people of the Japanese Empire, has established a strategic position of certain final victory."</p>
<h3 id="e6">Navy Minister Shimada Reports on Naval Achievements <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Navy Minister Shimada reported on the naval battles since May of this year at the 81st Diet session on the 27th. The general outline is as follows: From the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War to mid-May of this year, after repeated naval battles, the strategic strongholds in the Western Pacific and the major areas in the South Seas have all fallen into our hands, establishing a very favorable foundation for combat. Recently, naval units have cooperated closely with the army, actively implementing combat, and constantly pursuing the defeated enemy, in order to destroy them. The current war has expanded to extremely distant regions, and its scale is also quite large. It can be roughly divided into three: (1) Operations in the Indian Ocean; (2) Operations in the Australian region; (3) Operations in the Pacific region. Regarding the Indian Ocean, our army has established a solid foundation by occupying Burma, the Andaman Islands, the Nicobar Islands, and Sumatra, making the war easier to conduct. Naval units searched for remnants of the enemy, from the Indian Ocean to as far as South Africa. For example, on May 31st, a special submarine force raided Diego Suarez, an important port at the northern tip of Madagascar, destroying a British battleship of the Elizabeth class and a cruiser of the Amos-class, giving the enemy a great shock. In total, our submarines sank 35 enemy ships, approximately 270,000 tons, in the Indian Ocean and South Africa. Regarding the Australian region, our naval units, with powerful air forces, have continuously bombed key locations on its west coast, such as Darwin, and on July 30th, bombed Port Hedland, a key hub in the central west coast, destroying the enemy's air force and destroying its ships and military facilities. During this period, they also bombed Aru Island, Kai Island, and Tanimbar Island in the Arafura Sea. During this period, our naval units have consistently conducted lively operations in New Guinea and the eastern coast of Australia. The bombings of Port Moresby and Townsville in northern Australia were the most intense. In total, the damage suffered by the enemy during this period, including the New Britain area, has reached 905 aircraft shot down and destroyed. The severity of the damage is self-evident. At sea, we have consistently used submarines and other forces to conduct operations in the waters near Australia, either destroying enemy transportation lines or disrupting their rear, all of which have yielded great results. For example, on May 31st, our special submarines broke into Sydney Harbor, sinking an enemy warship. The enemy's losses were very great. Regarding the Pacific Ocean, our naval units have consistently pursued the remnants of the enemy in various parts of the Pacific Ocean leading to the United States mainland, in order to destroy them. During this period, all important naval battles almost all occurred in that area. We have used powerful forces to raid key locations that the enemy regarded as forward bases, such as Dutch Harbor in the Aleutian Islands and Midway Island in the Hawaiian Islands. The enemy's forces and bases have been heavily damaged. On June 4th and 5th, our powerful naval forces braved severe weather and continuously bombed Dutch Harbor and the surrounding islands, heavily damaging enemy airfields, ships, and important military facilities. At the same time, when our naval forces launched a large-scale attack on Midway Island, they fiercely attacked the American fleet that was heading to reinforce that area. The decisive naval battle was quite fierce. Our side lost one aircraft carrier, and one aircraft carrier and one cruiser were destroyed, and 35 aircraft were lost. However, our side sank three American ships, the aircraft carrier USS Yorktown and one large cruiser and one submarine, and shot down 105 of their aircraft. This time, the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise was also heavily damaged, and important military facilities were destroyed. Later, on June 7th, our navy occupied Kiska Island, an important western stronghold in the Aleutian Islands, and on the 8th, occupied Attu Island at its western end. These islands are important strongholds in the northern Pacific, with important strategic positions. Also, some of our submarines have operated far off the Pacific coast of the United States, either disrupting enemy sea lanes or attacking their important bases. Now, I will briefly report on the situation of the most intense South Pacific operations. The importance of that area has increased since our army occupied the Solomon Islands, making the enemy deeply uneasy. The enemy and I had a so-called Battle of the Coral Sea in early May. On August 7th, the enemy launched a large-scale counter-offensive against the southern end of the Solomon Islands, the tip of our occupied territories. A powerful British-American joint fleet and more than ten transport ships invaded Tulagi and Guadalcanal. Our naval units immediately confronted them. From August 7th to 9th, our naval air force continuously carried out bombings, and the naval units boldly entered the enemy's ranks at midnight on the 8th, carrying out night battles. In this battle, we sank a total of 35 British and American cruisers (13) and destroyers (22), and heavily damaged other ships and aircraft, reaping great results. This is the so-called First Battle of the Solomon Sea. Our side's losses in this battle were very small, only 21 aircraft and two cruisers slightly damaged. This operation was the enemy's first large-scale counter-offensive. Since the enemy's naval forces were severely damaged, and their land forces landed on Tulagi and Guadalcanal, confronting our garrison, and the enemy's air force also participated in the battle, the subsequent battles between us in the vicinity became more intense, and large and small naval battles occurred repeatedly. For example, on the night of August 17th, an American surprise attack force came to attack Maiana Island, the northern end of the Gilbert Islands occupied by us. About 200 American troops successfully landed, but were immediately completely repelled by our garrison. Subsequently, our powerful forces engaged in the Second Battle of the Solomon Islands in the sea east of the Solomon Islands on August 24th. In the following two months, large and small battles continued to occur in that area. During that time, our side sank the American aircraft carrier USS Wasp, three cruisers, and a total of 22 other enemy ships, and shot down and destroyed 519 aircraft. In addition, many enemy battleships and aircraft carriers were destroyed, reaping great results. Our losses were two cruisers, two destroyers, one submarine, five transport ships, and 135 aircraft. After repeated defeats, the enemy was overwhelmed with frustration. In order to reverse the decline, they used their remaining forces to move north of the Santa Cruz Islands in late October. As a result, the Battle of the South Pacific occurred on October 26th. Our fleet fiercely attacked the enemy from dawn to night on that day, and after a day of fierce fighting, we sank one enemy battleship, three aircraft carriers, three cruisers, and one destroyer, for a total of eight ships, and heavily damaged six other ships and shot down more than 200 enemy aircraft. Our side only had two aircraft carriers and one cruiser slightly damaged. Although the enemy fleet was severely defeated, they still used their rear-area base at close range to repeatedly force reinforcements and supplies to the landing forces on Guadalcanal. We also took the opportunity to counterattack, and the Third Battle of the Solomon Sea and the Battle of Lunga Point occurred successively on the 11th. From November 12th to 14th, enemy ships appeared one after another in the Guadalcanal area. Our fleet attacked them day and night. On the night of the 14th, they attacked a powerful enemy reinforcement force northwest of Guadalcanal. After a fierce battle, we sank two enemy battleships, eleven cruisers, and many other ships and aircraft. Our side lost one battleship, one cruiser, and three destroyers, and one battleship was damaged. Our battleships attacked enemy ship formations at night with supporting units, destroying enemy ships, causing our battleships to be the first to be sacrificed since the start of the war, suffering concentrated attacks from enemy forces. Next, on the night of November 30th, our mine warfare unit attacked a powerful enemy fleet again in the sea off Lunga Point on Guadalcanal Island. After a magnificent night battle, we sank one enemy battleship and one Augusta-class cruiser and two destroyers, demonstrating the power of our night battle unit. As such, our navy's operations in the South Pacific are proceeding favorably, and our side has repeatedly reaped great results. Although we have also suffered some losses, the naval units have consistently cooperated closely with the army, courageously advancing to complete the combat objectives. In addition to the larger operations mentioned above, the Japanese Navy has also undertaken important tasks in other regions, dividing land and sea responsibilities, actually conducting operations, and making the strategic situation occupied by the Empire more and more solid. Here, I will once again state the overall results obtained by our navy in the year since the start of the war. We have sunk 11 enemy battleships, 11 aircraft carriers (including one seaplane carrier), 46 cruisers, 48 destroyers, 13 submarines, and 54 other ships. Not counting other ships, a total of 1.1 million tons of warships were sunk, accounting for 38 percent of the total strength of the British, American, and Soviet navies before the war. In addition, 9 battleships, 4 aircraft carriers, 19 cruisers, 23 destroyers, 60 submarines, and 39 other ships were heavily damaged. Also, 424 merchant ships were sunk and destroyed, totaling 2.27 million tons. 9 warships and 503 merchant ships were captured, approximately 220,000 tons. 3,853 aircraft were shot down and destroyed. All of this has caused enormous damage to the enemy. Although the enemy authorities are doing their best to conceal it from their people, the depth of the blow can already be seen from this. As for our navy's losses, there have been 1 battleship, 3 aircraft carriers, 4 cruisers, 15 destroyers, 9 submarines, and 20 other ships, as well as 65 naval-related ships of 200,000 tons, and 568 aircraft. The damaged ships include 1 battleship, 2 aircraft carriers, 3 cruisers, 9 destroyers, 1 submarine, and 10 other ships. Now that the war situation has reached the decisive stage, our naval officers and soldiers, with the sincere assistance of the people, have an increasingly high morale. With the belief of certain victory, we will overcome any difficulties, annihilate the enemy, and complete the final objective of the war.</p>

<p>Berlin, 27th (Domei News Agency) - People here claimed last night that the Red Army's Christmas Day offensive against the strong defense lines of the Axis forces in various areas had failed, and suffered great losses. There were fierce tank battles in the narrow area between the Volga and Don rivers and the Terek area of the Caucasus. The Soviet army lost 136 tanks in these two areas and other areas of the long front line, including a tank brigade that was completely annihilated in the Terek area. The German Air Force assisted the German and Axis forces in combat on that day, breaking up the Soviet army's attacks. Various German aircraft cooperated to bomb the Soviet army, transport vehicles, and transportation lines. 30 Soviet aircraft were shot down. The temperature on the Eastern Front dropped to minus 20 degrees Celsius. The Soviet commander has dispatched additional troops to attack the Axis forces' positions between the Volga and Don rivers, and used heavy artillery and large tank formations to assist in the battle. However, the Axis forces stood firm and repelled the Soviet army's repeated attacks. The Soviet army's manpower and material resources suffered an electrical shock, with nothing gained. In the Caucasus area, there was a lot of activity on the banks of the Terek River. The Soviet infantry there, with the assistance of large tank formations, attempted to break into the Axis forces' positions, but repeated attacks were defeated. A Soviet tank brigade was annihilated by the German counter-offensive. The weather was bad in the Tuapse area of northwestern Caucasus, with heavy fog. The Soviet army made several local attacks, but was driven back by the German army. The Soviet army on the central front attempted to break through the German defense lines in Rzhev and Velikiye Luki (northwest of Moscow) at night, but was also severely damaged and retreated.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet border, 26th (Havas Agency) - Yesterday, the Red Army continued to attack the German army in various places on the Eastern Front, but they were all repelled and suffered heavy losses. Here is a summary of the battle situations on each front: (1) On the north bank of the Baksan River in the Caucasus, the Soviet Union is still using large forces to escape the German army's front line, but they are all blocked by the German army and have made no progress, and have lost 29 tanks. (2) The Red Army between the Volga and Don rivers has been repelled several times, losing 42 tanks. The Hungarian army in that area is very active. The Hungarian air force is also coordinating with German aircraft to cover the army's operations. Several Hungarian troops on the east bank of the Don River launched a fierce attack on the Soviet army's positions, and the Soviet army was defeated and retreated. (3) Northwest of Voronezh and in the Kaluga region, the Axis forces launched a large-scale counter-offensive. The Soviet army resisted stubbornly and suffered heavy losses, and was finally forced to retreat. (4) The fierce battle between the German and Soviet armies in the middle reaches of the Don River has lasted for ten days and was still fierce yesterday. (5) The German garrison in Velikiye Luki has repelled the Soviet army's offensive several times and has consolidated the positions around the city.

<h3 id="e12">Japan's Politics in the Year Since the Start of the Greater East Asia War <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>The Greater East Asia War has been going on for a year. In this year, Japan has not only established a foundation for certain victory militarily, but has also established a unique political system domestically, in step with military victories. This is a landmark page in Japanese history. It can also be said that there is no precedent in the political history of various countries in the world, because in this year, Japanese politics has rapidly established a strong political leadership of the government in accordance with national goals under the supreme goal of striving for victory. Based on this, it has further formed a new national organization. In this way, the national people and the government's policies have established a strong political situation under close coordination. I remember that during the Second Konoe Cabinet, there were three basic national policies for political reforms in Japan, namely (1) a new political system, (2) the establishment of a national organization, and (3) the achievement of a parliamentary endorsement system. This work was fully realized in just over half a year under the Tojo Cabinet. This is the biggest gain in Japanese politics under the Greater East Asia War. On the one hand, this gain is a necessity of the objective conditions under wartime, and on the other hand, it can be said to be the result of the Tojo Cabinet's decisive execution. The first key to wartime politics is the strengthening of the government's political leadership. The basis of this strengthening should be (1) the integration of political strategy and war, (2) the strengthening of the Prime Minister's authority and the unity of the cabinet, and (3) the comprehensive efficiency of internal and external administration. The promotion of these government affairs was carried out in a straightforward manner when the Tojo Cabinet was formed. That is, Prime Minister Tojo concurrently served as the Minister of the Army as an active-duty general, and first obtained integration with the General Staff Headquarters, and the Prime Minister's position was actually strengthened. Secondly, in order to ensure transportation capacity, the Wartime Transportation Committee was established in the Planning Board on January 6, the Technology Institute was established on February 1, and the Greater East Asia Construction Deliberation Council was established in the Cabinet to allow powerful figures from the private sector to participate in the planning of important national policies. Then, on July 1, local offices were established in 427 locations across the country to strengthen local administration in response to administrative simplification. Regarding the issue of administrative simplification, the outline for implementation was decided by the cabinet meeting on June 16. On the one hand, the number of civil servants in various agencies was reduced, and on the other hand, this was used to allocate resources to the construction of Greater East Asia. The implementation measures were fully announced on November 1 and implemented on the same day. At the same time, the issue of the establishment of the Ministry of Greater East Asia and the outline of the unification of internal and external administration were also fully announced and implemented on November 1, and the government's strong political leadership also permeated the entire administrative system, establishing a new system for administrative operations. Secondly, the consolidation of domestic political forces is essential under wartime. The Japanese government also exerted its strong political leadership in this regard and resolutely implemented the system of recommending candidates for general elections at the end of April. As a result, the elected candidates who were recommended accounted for an absolute majority, which is enough to show the determination of the Japanese people to fully complete the war. At the same time, the Japanese government further focused on the unity of national political forces. A political association was formed by a large number of members of the House of Peers and the House of Representatives and powerful figures from all walks of life, with General Abe Nobuyuki as the president. Soon after, the Imperial Rule Assistance Association was comprehensively reorganized, and the personnel and institutions were expanded. According to the cabinet decision on May 15, the Imperial Rule Assistance Association unified all national movement groups, and established affairs bureau chiefs in local branches to cooperate in strengthening local institutions and guiding activities such as neighborhood associations, becoming an administrative auxiliary institution. By the end of September, the Imperial Rule Assistance Association convened the third Central Cooperation Conference to make the intentions of the superior known to the subordinate, and the subordinate's situation known to the superior. The Imperial Rule Assistance Association became one with the government, achieving the ideal state of an endorsed political system and achieving unprecedented results. It is worth mentioning here that in the past year, all Japanese citizens have been able to cooperate with the government with their sincere attitude. I also recall that Prime Minister Tojo said at a lecture for local governors on November 14 that the government will definitely avoid using power and trusts that the people will do their best to complete the war with their sincere dedication. Therefore, Japan's politics in the past year has exerted the greatest power under the united pace of the whole country, thereby establishing a political system of national unity.</p>

<p>Bern, Switzerland, December 27th, Havas: It is learned that no major changes have occurred in the situation in North Africa in the past 24 hours. In Tunisia, US troops are still a few miles east of Médenine and El Bab. In Libya, the positions of the British Eighth Army are west of Sirte.</p>
<p>Berlin, December 27th, Allied News: The Tunisian front was relatively quiet yesterday, as the Allied forces are now organizing their defenses after being defeated in the Maktar and El Bab areas last Thursday. The US forces have not attempted to retake the mountains now occupied by German forces. It is also reported that German assault troops have occupied the foothills west of Kairouan. Bern, Switzerland, December 26th, Havas: According to reports from the Axis and Anglo-American sides, there were no major changes on the North African front yesterday. In Tripolitania, activities were limited to scouting. The British also claimed that their advance guard had reached Bir Tarsin and that the main force of the Eighth Army had approached Sirte. At the same time, German Commander-in-Chief Rommel has entrusted the defense of the Misratah line to Italian forces. In Tunisia, Axis forces are consolidating their positions in the Maktar and El Bab areas. There was some fighting six miles northeast of the city. The Anglo-American Allied Headquarters in North Africa announced that a fierce German attack in the Kairouan area was repelled. There was some scouting activity near Bou Arada, west of Teboursouk. Fighting on the Tunisian front has been hampered by bad weather. Berlin also claimed that port facilities and railway transportation in Algeria were heavily bombed by German aircraft. All docks in the port of Algiers were destroyed, and warehouses were also set on fire. At the same time, German fighter groups flew low and bombed trucks carrying food and ammunition to supply Anglo-American Allied forces in Tunisia, causing heavy losses to the enemy.</p>

<p>Ankara, December 27th, Havas: The Turkish newspaper "Ulus" published an article by parliamentarian Ate, stating that the Saadabad Pact automatically extended for another five years starting from the 25th of this month, because the four signatory countries of Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan did not notify the abolition of the pact. The Foreign Ministers of the four countries sent congratulatory telegrams on the occasion of the extension of the pact. Turkey believes that the pact is a guarantee of peace in the Near East, and that all issues are resolved peacefully. With the international situation becoming increasingly tense, the importance of the pact has also increased. Although Iraq and Iran are not belligerent countries, they are greatly affected by the war. Afghanistan is also in a difficult position. After the extension of the pact, the peace between the four signatory countries will continue to be guaranteed.</p>

<p>Vichy, December 27th, Allied News: In his Christmas broadcast on the 26th, President Pétain called on all French people to make further efforts to rebuild France, saying, "I still have unshakable faith in the future of France. I remember that in June 1940, I agreed with you that I would stay in France forever. Today, I still adhere to this belief and work as President to rebuild France. Fellow citizens, in order to overcome current difficulties and restore the traditional face of our France, we must understand that cooperation is essential. The reconstruction of France must also depend on your cooperation. What France will be like next year is difficult to predict at this moment, and it is up to God to decide. But here, I want to say to you that all French people should reflect on the reasons for the current difficulties."</p>

<p>Lisbon, December 27th, Havas: New York dispatch: General Eisenhower, while on a tour, learned of Darlan's assassination and hurriedly returned to Algiers. According to well-informed sources in the United States, the US policy in North Africa will not change due to Darlan's death. The New York Times also stated that Darlan's death would not affect the temporary agreements made by the United States in North Africa. As for who the US military authorities in North Africa will contact in the future, this can be freely decided by General Eisenhower. The New York Tribune, however, stated that even with Darlan's death, it would be difficult for the Allied forces in North Africa to overcome disagreements.</p>
<p>Tangier, December 27th, Havas: This morning, the Allied Headquarters in Algiers issued a communiqué confirming that General Giraud has succeeded Darlan in managing the administrative affairs of French North Africa.</p>
<p>Tangier, December 27th, Havas: General Giraud stated today after being appointed High Commissioner that his ambition is to be a soldier, not a politician. According to an official spokesman in Algiers, General Giraud has many affairs to attend to, and it is not yet known whether he will actually take over military command in North Africa. However, Giraud's main goal is to continue fighting there. No decision has yet been made on how to organize the High Commissioner's staff. Since General Giraud has accepted the position left by Darlan, it is expected that he will organize a unified French front to resist the Axis forces.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, December 27th, Havas: According to a report from the London Observer correspondent, General de Gaulle has expressed his willingness to cooperate with General Giraud.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, December 27th, Havas: London dispatch: General Giraud, when interviewed by American reporters yesterday, refused to comment on the political situation in North Africa caused by Darlan's assassination, but said that it is necessary to strengthen cooperation with General de Gaulle in the future. It is generally believed that this statement can reveal the motives for Darlan's assassination.</p>
<p>Vichy, December 27th, Havas: Political figures here believe that the fact that the assassin of Darlan was quickly executed and that the details of the assassin were not disclosed is to keep the political background of the case as secret as possible. Regarding the selection of Darlan's successor, it is considered very difficult here, because this time the British intelligence personnel dealt a great blow to the United States, and the faith of the French people in North Africa in the United States has been shaken. As for General Giraud, he has no political experience, so it is difficult for him to be competent. The fact that Governor Boisson, General Noguès, and General Juin are holding meetings and have not yet reached a decision proves that their opinions are also inconsistent. The crux of the problem lies in the future attitude of the North African government, because the people of North Africa are practicing Darlan's promises, maintaining General Pétain's policies, and dedicating themselves to the unity between France and its colonies.</p>

<p>Jiaxing, December 27th, Central News Agency: The work in the second phase of the Qingxiang area in Southeast Taihu Lake has been carried out so far and has achieved the expected results. In order to inspect the actual situation in the local area, Chuan, the Concurrent Director, specially went to Zha Pu, Pinghu from Jiaxing on the morning of the 24th, accompanied by Tokue Kohaku, the Director of the Hangzhou Special Affairs Agency, and many staff members. Zha Pu is an important coastal town in Zhejiang Province and the location of a major eastern port. After listening to local reports, the Chuan Party gave instructions to representatives from all walks of life and then inspected the coast for a week.

<h3 id="e26">Yamamoto Sanetomo, President of the Japanese Renovation Society, Writes to the People of Chongqing <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo, 17th, Central News Agency) The Japanese journal "Renovation" in its New Year's issue carries an essay by its president, Yamamoto Sanetomo, titled "To the Gentlemen of Chongqing," which essentially states that Roosevelt once said, "America is the arsenal of democracy" to rally against the Axis powers. However, America has also been made dictatorial by Roosevelt's own hand, and opposition to Roosevelt's political methods is increasing daily. The previous defeat of Roosevelt's father in the New York gubernatorial election is clear evidence of this. Furthermore, the recent request for wartime special powers was also unresolved in the House of Representatives, proving that Roosevelt's authority has been swept away. Hoover recently criticized the impropriety of domestic divisions and fully exposed the struggles between American industry and bureaucrats. The author Pearl Buck recently also criticized the government based on issues of black racial equality and black blood transfusions. According to statistics, there are currently 12.8 million black people living in the United States, but the actual number is closer to 16 million. Although the American government ostensibly allows them to participate in political conferences, in reality, Mitchell, who was elected as a senator with hundreds of thousands of votes, was prevented from riding in first-class carriages solely because he was black. It is unknown what America's so-called "democracy," "human equality," and "humanitarian justice" really are. I have personally witnessed the tragic oppression of black people. America also fears an increase in the number of black people in America, so they offer free abortions, can this be called humanitarianism? Furthermore, Chinese immigrants in America receive the same treatment as black people. This is something that Chiang Kai-shek and Soong Tzu-wen are not unaware of, so why are they willing to place Asia, with its long and glorious history, in the position of a slave to the Anglo-Saxons? Chiang and others are foolishly complacent because of the glory of their ancestors, yet they are willing to obliterate the glory of Chinese history and culture, and the teachings of Confucius and other sages. The representative black magazine "Africa" once stated that Anglo-American imperialism is nothing more than white supremacy over the world, and hopes that China will also recognize this point and not suffer the same fate as Africans. Furthermore, it is hoped that Chinese people will recognize that Japan's motive stems from the survival of the entire East. China and Japan are of the same culture and race, and have an inseparable relationship. However, if China is controlled by Anglo-American imperialism, the consequences will be unimaginable. It is ridiculous that Chiang Kai-shek views the imperialism of the white race as sacred, while looking down on Japan's true intention to revive Asia. Gentlemen in the rear, why do you tolerate the advance of Anglo-American forces into Asia and Africa, but not allow Japan to revive Asia? What is the reason for this? What country other than Japan possesses the military and economic power to achieve human equality? It is hoped that the gentlemen of Chongqing will recognize this point and consider the future of the nation. If the independence of China that Chongqing desires must be borrowed from England and America, then the future result will inevitably be that China's state of semi-colonialism will become even more profound, and may even become slaves to England and America. This can be clearly understood from the aforementioned situation of black people and the current situation of France. Moreover, Japan's military and political power has already controlled the entire Greater East Asia, so dependence on England and America is impossible. Sun Yat-sen, the father of the Chinese nation, once said that if China and Japan do not cooperate closely, there is no way to realize the liberation of East Asia. The predictions of the East Asian future by Chinese and Japanese visionaries have been realized in the first year of the Greater East Asia War, expelling the British and Americans from East Asia. The results of the lifelong revolutionary efforts of Sun Yat-sen and Song Jiaoren are only being held by a few people in Chongqing. What is being given to the 450 million people is only starvation. The leaders of Chongqing have turned the great cause of the revolution into a tool to satisfy their own desires, and they are not only traitors who are selling out the 450 million people to England and America, but also public enemies of East Asia. The spirits of Sun Yat-sen and the other martyrs in heaven will surely be unable to rest in peace knowing of Chongqing's actions to destroy the nation and the people. The chairman and his comrades, in the face of countless difficulties, disregard slanderous attacks and are not afraid of the destruction by evil forces. They take all the people of the nation as their focus and the future of Asia in decades and centuries as their goal. Their painstaking efforts for the country and the people and their unyielding spirit are truly felt by both gods and men. Millions of Japanese soldiers and the entire nation are prepared to die, starting this war in the East with the sole purpose of planning for the future of East Asia. The fundamental ideal of the Japanese people today is the same ideal of shared security and common destiny that the Chinese people possess. One hundred million Japanese people are willing to make any sacrifice to liberate East Asia and strive for the glory of victory. It is hoped that the gentlemen of Chongqing will understand that Japan's glory is also China's glory. Only after China has gained liberation can the independence and prosperity of Asia and the independence and prosperity of China and Japan be realized.</p>

<p>In order to alleviate the people's hardship and maintain the food supply within the concessions, the authorities of the Public and French Concessions have implemented a rationed food supply system based on population since July 6th of this year, eliminating the situation of queuing to buy rice. Residents within the concessions can purchase rice and flour from designated rice stores with which the authorities have contracted, based on the rice purchase certificates issued by the authorities. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective. Shanghai News reporters learned yesterday from relevant parties and the rice industry that the authorities are determined to maintain the food supply for the people of Shanghai. In addition to making every effort to facilitate the source of supply, the rationed amount of rice and flour will be increased to make it more sufficient for taxpayers within the concessions and prevent private traders from raising prices for profit. The 22nd term household food rations are approved from January 1st to 9th of next year. All designated rice stores are closed on the 10th as usual. Each designated rice store received a purchase order from the Rice and Grain Office: (1) Rice is 304 yuan and 40 cents per bag, the previous term was 309 yuan and 30 cents; (2) Flour is 92 yuan per bag, the previous term was 95 yuan. The amount of rice flour paired with white rice is the same as the previous term, but the amount of flour has increased by about one-quarter. Therefore, it is expected that the next term will still be one and a half liters of white rice, and the flour will increase to two catties, and the exact amount and selling price will be clearly announced by the authorities. Each rice store is approved to pay the fee and receive the delivery order today, and pick up the goods from the designated Swire Zhexing warehouse in the next few days, and sell them in accordance with the date and method stipulated by the authorities.</p>

<p>Day 1</p>
<p>(November 26th) The East Asia Economic Conference, with the participation of more than 500 members from Japan, Manchuria, China, and Mongolia, as well as influential economists from other private sectors, and relevant government officials, held its fourth conference at the Greater East Asia Hall in Marunouchi, Tokyo, over three days starting on the 26th. On the first day of the conference, the 26th, starting at 8:00 am, the new president, Ogura Masatsune, gave the opening speech, followed by reports on the association's affairs by Japanese headquarters director Fujiyama Aiichiro, Manchurian headquarters director Feng Hanqing, Central China headquarters director Chen Shao-wei, North China headquarters director Izumi Son, and Xinjiang headquarters director Munakata Hisayuki. Next, the election of 80 new members to the council was held. At 9:30 am, the opening ceremony was held, with Prime Minister Tojo giving a congratulatory speech. In the afternoon session, speeches were given by Aoki, Minister of Greater East Asia, on "The Economic Construction of Greater East Asia," and Kaya Okinori, Minister of Finance, on "The Ideals of Economic Construction in Greater East Asia." Following this, Ruan Zhenduo, Minister of Economy of Manchuria, and Wang Yintai, Superintendent of the Industry Bureau of the North China Political Affairs Commission, gave detailed reports on the economic construction of each region. The first day's conference ended at 5:00 pm.</p>
<p>Speech by Aoki, Minister of Greater East Asia</p>
<p>(Omitted) Regarding the measures for economic construction in Greater East Asia, the Greater East Asia Construction Deliberation Council, which is affiliated to the Cabinet, has already conducted a thorough review and replied to the government. The government is very pleased with this reply and is implementing various measures based on it. The contents are briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>First, the economic construction of Greater East Asia is based on morality, aiming to build a new economic order in Greater East Asia and contribute to the construction of a new world economy. This is based on the traditional Japanese spirit of "Hakko Ichiu," and has essential differences from the colonial policies of countries such as the United States, England, and the Netherlands in the East. Therefore, the residents of each country in Greater East Asia must be made to do their best and get what they deserve. To achieve this, they must cooperate with each other and move forward towards a common ideal. Second, it is necessary to comprehensively enhance the economic strength of the entire Greater East Asia by leveraging the human resources and resources of each region, and to complete the self-sufficient national defense economy necessary for the defense of Greater East Asia, with the Empire as its center. This will be the only way to build a superior position within the scope of the Greater East Asia world economy, and at the same time ensure the survival of each country in the Greater East Asia region, so that the people of each country can live and work in peace. Third, the focus of current construction work must be placed on the rapid enhancement of the power to wage war. If the Greater East Asia War is not won, all ideals and hopes will be reduced to nothing. We must know that the countries of Greater East Asia and their residents share a common destiny, and the concept of opposition like "brothers quarreling within the walls" is absolutely not allowed. We must work together to enhance comprehensive combat power.</p>
<p>Under the above-mentioned ideals, our Imperial Country is exerting the full strength of the nation to complete the Greater East Asia War and is working towards the construction of Greater East Asia. The reason why the government established the Ministry of Greater East Asia is to enable the central government and the local areas to quickly and appropriately handle the various matters of Greater East Asia construction under a unified organization.</p>
<p>Next, I would like to briefly explain the specific measures for economic construction:</p>
<p>First, measures related to agriculture, forestry, and aquatic and livestock industries. The majority of the population in each region of Greater East Asia is engaged in agriculture, forestry, and aquatic and livestock industries, so this point needs special attention. Important food grains necessary for the Imperial Country can be ensured to be self-sufficient through Japan-Manchuria cooperation. Areas with insufficient food grains can be supplied by other regions. At the current time of war, there are various inconveniences in transportation, and it is not yet possible to expect complete satisfaction, but this is only a temporary phenomenon, and the problem will be solved with the establishment of fundamental countermeasures in the future.</p>
<p>Regarding forestry measures, the current focus must be placed on the supply and securing of materials necessary for military demand and the expansion of production capacity. Therefore, the development of southern forest resources is particularly expected.</p>
<p>In terms of the aquatic industry, in accordance with the characteristics of each region, the aim is to supply and secure aquatic products, and to prepare refrigeration, freezing, processing, and other facilities, and to promote the comprehensive development of the aquatic industry. In terms of the livestock industry, along with the supply and securing of livestock food grains, the expansion of the production of wool, fur, and leather is also an urgent task.</p>
<p>Regarding fiber resources, in accordance with the characteristics of each region, the aim is to comprehensively develop and utilize various resources such as cotton, hemp, silk, wool, and weaving raw materials. In particular, the increase in cotton production in China is highly anticipated, and it is hoped that all relevant parties will pay special attention to it.</p>
<p>In addition, southern specialties such as sand, rubber, quinine, and mallet trees have more than enough to supply the needs of the co-prosperity sphere, and these must be scientifically utilized so as to ensure the superior position of Greater East Asia in the world economy.</p>
<p>Next, measures related to the steel industry. The focus must be placed on enhancing the power to wage war, ensuring wartime life, and establishing the foundation for future industrial development. Furthermore, the aim is to achieve the leaping development of Greater East Asia's industry and the prosperity of the people of Greater East Asia. In the current situation, the focus must be placed on the construction of steel, coal, oil, other liquid fuels, copper, aluminum, aircraft, ships, fertilizers, and electricity. Therefore, in order to implement this purpose, the labor force, transportation capacity, materials, and funds within the co-prosperity sphere must be concentrated as much as possible and utilized. In addition, regarding national defense industries and basic industries, etc., in order to strengthen their organic integration throughout the Greater East Asia region in industrial sectors that are indispensable for enhancing combat power, the Imperial Country must統轄their construction and operation. Regarding civilian industries and other industries, on the one hand, autonomy in management should be sought, and on the other hand, technicians and laborers necessary for local development must be sought from the local residents as much as possible.</p>
<p>After investigating the existing state of resources, the local plans for major industries are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(A) The focus of new expansion in the steel industry will be placed in Manchuria and North China.</p>
<p>(B) The coal mining industry will be extensively developed in North China, Manchuria, and the rest of the region. For special coals such as raw material coal and "producer gas coal," a focus on increased production will be implemented throughout the region.</p>
<p>(C) The development of natural petroleum will focus on South China, and artificial petroleum projects will be expanded with a focus on Manchuria, Sakhalin, Hokkaido, and North China.</p>
<p>(D) The aluminum industry will currently focus on Korea and Manchuria, and may be expanded to North China and the South in the future.</p>
<p>(E) The fiber industry will be temporarily limited to a certain scope, and will then be gradually expanded to the co-prosperity sphere region in accordance with changes in various circumstances.</p>
<p>(F) The Imperial Country places special emphasis on the development of high-level industries such as precision industries, machinery industries, and weapons industries.</p>
<p>(G) The development of electric power, in response to national defense plans and industrial development plans, will be implemented comprehensively and systematically, with a focus on hydroelectric power generation.</p>
<p>Again, measures related to transportation. It is no exaggeration to say that the current bottleneck in Greater East Asia's economic construction is transportation. In order to quickly transport the abundant resources of various places, the functions and characteristics of ships, railways, automobiles, aviation, etc. must be fully utilized, and the overall efficiency of transportation must be maximized. At the same time, in the Sea of Japan, the East China Sea, the South China Sea, and other areas, a powerful transportation zone centered on Japan must be created, making it like an inland sea within Greater East Asia. In the continental sphere of Manchuria, China, and Mongolia, and in other marine spheres in the South, it is necessary to establish the transportation situation necessary for industry in accordance with their respective positions, and to further make this a base for the development of transportation to the world.</p>
<p>In short, in order to complete the current Greater East Asia War and carry out powerful economic construction, it is strongly felt that it is necessary to comprehensively and systematically implement measures in the above-mentioned economic sectors.</p>
<p>Currently, the construction of Greater East Asia is progressing with great strides. In addition to our ever-growing Imperial Country, the State of Manchuria, which is united with the Imperial Country with one heart and one mind, is also welcoming its tenth anniversary of its founding, and industry and the various fields of economy have made great strides. In addition, the Republic of China has been in Nanjing for more than two years, and the war has not yet ended due to the stubborn Chongqing regime's continued resistance, but its political influence is great, so economic reconstruction and construction are being carried out step by step. Under the spirit of sharing weal and woe with Japan, it is making a great contribution to the construction of Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our country's cooperation with Siam and Annam, especially in the economic field, is becoming increasingly close. In the vast new occupied territories in the South, we have further secured the treasure trove that is said to be the only one in the world, and are actively engaged in development and construction activities in accordance with the different characteristics of each region. In other words, the economic construction of Greater East Asia has already embarked on a magnificent start. However, the Greater East Asia War is still raging, and the construction of Greater East Asia is still very difficult. In order to win this long-term war and complete the great cause of construction, on the one hand, it depends on the hard work and efforts of the 100 million people of the Imperial Country, and on the other hand, the cooperation of the countries and residents of the co-prosperity sphere is also indispensable.</p>
<p>In the end, the solution to the current problems depends on cooperation. This so-called cooperation refers to: correctly understanding the positions of the other parties based on the sense of shared destiny of the countries and residents of Greater East Asia, and jointly seeking agreement on national policy views.</p>
<p>However, in order to smoothly realize this cooperative relationship, it is not enough to rely solely on the agreement of opinions between countries. It is also necessary to seek genuine friendship and integration through the contact of people's business and their daily lives. What I have said above is not only a theory, but also a conclusion and a belief that I have recently gained during my foreign service. As for the fate of the newly established Ministry of Greater East Asia, I always want to do my best to seek mutual cooperation between the countries and residents of Greater East Asia. In this sense, the East Asia Economic Conference makes a great contribution to the communication of opinions and the realization of cooperation between Japan, Manchuria, and China. I hope that in the midst of the current tension of the great war, this conference will move the task further forward and make further contributions to the construction of Greater East Asia, in order to thoroughly complete the purpose of the conference.</p>
<p>Speech by Finance Minister Kaya</p>
<p>(Omitted) Among the various measures, especially regarding trade, finance, and fiscal issues, I would like to briefly describe the following:</p>
<p>The glorious achievements of the Imperial Army have instantly increased the resources of the co-prosperity sphere, but the effective and appropriate utilization depends on how the planned transactions within and outside the sphere are conducted.</p>
<p>The exchange of goods in Greater East Asia aims to complete the Greater East Asia War and enhance national power, that is, to establish and develop the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere, and to implement highly planned transactions centered on Japan. Therefore, on the one hand, in response to the already decided industrial location plans in various places in Greater East Asia, a comprehensive transaction plan is set up, and at the same time, speed and accuracy are the first priority, and it is also necessary to comprehensively adjust this plan in connection with various measures such as exchange rates, prices, tariffs, and transaction institutions.</p>
<p>As for finance, in a nutshell, it is the issue of establishing the Greater East Asia financial zone centered on the Japanese yen. Settlements between regions within the Greater East Asia zone must be executed in accordance with the Japanese yen, with the Bank of Japan at the center, in a comprehensive and unified manner. At the same time, the currencies of each region in the zone must use the Japanese yen as the value standard and issuing base, and the issuing institutions of each region in the zone must have a yen transaction account in the Bank of Japan. It goes without saying that settlements between regions must be executed in this way, and settlements with regions outside the zone must also be executed in this way. Therefore, the exchange rate of the currencies of each region in the zone against the Japanese yen must be fairly assessed, so that the comprehensive planning of materials, labor, and other aspects of Greater East Asia can be effectively completed. At the same time, the prices and currency values of each region must be stabilized, so that the overall production, material exchange, and labor dispatch of Greater East Asia can be promoted smoothly, and the national defense economic power can be increased.</p>
<p>Next, regarding fiscal matters, it is hoped that each region in the zone will be able to bear its own military facility expenses, industrial development expenses, etc., in order to strengthen fiscal independence. At the same time, efforts must be made to mutually adjust the fiscal burden. The so-called mutual adjustment of the fiscal burden is nothing more than the fiscal "concept of each doing what they can and cooperating and bearing the burden." That is, each region within the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere must be aware of the lofty, universal, and common purpose of "establishing, maintaining, and developing Greater East Asia," and must actively contribute its own share to achieve this purpose. At the same time, from a negative perspective, there must be a determination to make great sacrifices for a long time in order to achieve the above-mentioned purpose. Each region must develop its own characteristics and do its best to cooperate and bear everything. In short, this is a great awakening that is characterized by the entire Greater East Asia sharing weal and woe. Based on the above-mentioned ideals, the emphasis in the expenditures of each region must be placed on many measures to establish and develop comprehensive national defense and economic power, in order to stabilize and improve the people's livelihood. In terms of revenue, each region must adopt a simple system based on fair standards as much as possible, and in particular, consider the choice of tax types according to the circumstances and the level of intelligence in each region. A formalistic uniformity must not be imposed on each region. Regarding the issuance of public bonds in each region, in conjunction with financial旋　, it must be implemented and controlled based on comprehensive planning. In accordance with the different circumstances in each city, appropriate methods must be used to ensure the source of funds needed for its finances.</p>
<p>The above has given a rough description of some measures for economic construction in Greater East Asia. Of course, such a great undertaking cannot be accomplished in a day or two. During implementation, it may be divided into several time stages. At the same time, each region has its own characteristics, and it is not possible to impose the same measures and rules on all of them. However, the most important point is that, in the end, it must be organically and comprehensively unified with Japan as the core.</p>

<h3 id="e34">Implementing New Price Control Measures: Establishing a Price Control Bureau, Adjusting Rationing with a Common Pricing System, and Implementing Normal Consumption Methods for Rice and Other Goods <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>In order to deliberate on price issues, relevant authorities have established local price control committees in various regions. Furthermore, to unify the official management affairs between the central government and local areas, a Price Control Bureau has been established in Shanghai. Similar committees have also been set up in Nanjing, Bengbu, Hangzhou, Hankou, Guangzhou, Subei, and Suhuai. The Price Control Committee differs from the Price Control Bureau in that the former is an agency for price deliberation, while the latter is an organization for price management. The former determines policies, while the latter implements them.</p>
<p>Price Control: Four Major Principles</p>
<p>The Shanghai Regional Price Control Bureau, following the guidelines of the local price control committees, is determined to implement the following four new principles: (1) Using materials crucial to the economic center as a foundation, referencing prices before the exchange of new and old currencies in May of this year to determine an appropriate price. (2) Reducing coal prices to achieve moderate rice prices. (3) To expand production, making efforts to acquire raw materials from North China, Mengjiang, Manchuria, and the South to prevent the accumulation of materials in specific regions. Utilizing idle capital for production, the Price Control Committee will be at the center, with various agencies assisting in the process.</p>
<p>Reducing Coal Prices, Adjusting Rice Prices</p>
<p>The above four principles are the backbone for implementing price controls. More detailed content can be divided into seven items: (1) Aiming for gradual stability, price control is based on prices before the exchange of new and old currencies in May of this year. (2) The Price Control Committee is at the center of price control, receiving guidance from relevant agencies, and comprehensively studying plans. (3) Appropriate prices will initially target materials crucial to the economic center. After agreement by private organizations, they will be implemented with the approval of administrative authorities. Coal prices will be reduced (already implemented), and rice prices will be adjusted so that other prices can be reduced accordingly. Matters concerning electricity, transportation, wages, land rent, housing rent, loan interest, and profits will also be moderated.</p>
<p>Easing Regional Controls</p>
<p>(4) Promoting increased production of materials in the interior and collecting raw materials from various regions to adjust material needs. At the same time, the agencies for handling goods distribution will be adjusted, adopting a common pricing system, prohibiting market manipulation and speculative trading, and implementing normal consumption methods for rice and other necessities. (5) Regarding restrictions on the movement of important materials, it is strictly forbidden to move them out of the area. Movement within the jurisdiction will be relaxed under the control of the authorities, minimizing accumulation in any one area and streamlining transportation to ensure smooth material exchange. (6) To smooth the currency policy based on the new legal tender and expand its circulation, idle capital will be absorbed and used for production. (7) Concerning price control, private groups will automatically enforce it.</p>

<p>Regarding firewood prices, it is heard that the two authorities have paid close attention and decided to find ways to lower them, or to assess and set price limits, ordering merchants in the industry to comply. In addition to lowering prices, the authorities will assist in purchasing large quantities of firewood to be shipped to Shanghai for sale, thereby increasing the supply of goods. Therefore, firewood prices may tend to fall.</p>

<p>To rectify the city's appearance, the Public Concession Police authorities have absolutely prohibited prostitutes from forcibly soliciting customers in the Nanjing Road area. They have also issued prostitute licenses and designated the area north of Edward Road, east of Yuqiaqing Road, south of Fuzhou Road, and west of Shandong Road as the "Morality Zone," ordering prostitutes to move into the "Morality Zone" to operate. Since the issuance of this order, the prostitution business in the Nanjing Road area has disappeared, and they have all moved into the "Morality Zone" to continue their business. They have also been ordered to have the Prostitute Guild notify all prostitutes to obtain licenses in accordance with the regulations, and no evasion is allowed. Any further violations will be severely punished if discovered.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Sugar and Oil Prepared for Per Capita Rationing, Special Rationing for Various Industries, Limited to Legitimate Business Use, Adopting an Application, Registration, and Approval System <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>To eliminate resale for profit and allow legitimate food users to obtain fair allocation, the Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office and the Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Office, with the approval of the military rationing authorities, are preparing to implement per capita rationing. Once detailed consideration and all preparation procedures for per capita allocation are completed, specific measures will be announced and implemented. According to sources at the Shanghai Social Reporter at the Sugar Merchants Cooperative and the Edible Oil Wholesale Office, industries that have legitimate business needs for sugar and oil after the implementation of per capita rationing will receive special allocations. (1) Confectionery and biscuit factories, cafes, etc., will receive the necessary sugar. (2) You tiao, deep-frying, roasted goods industries, Chinese and Western restaurants, etc., will receive the necessary edible oil. This is to ensure that their businesses are not affected by per capita rationing. The specific measures for special allocation are still under discussion, but will adopt an application, registration, and approval system, limited to applicants with proven legitimate needs. The amount of allocation will be determined by the needs of the business. Strict regulations will require that the sugar and oil obtained must be completely used for business needs and must not be stored or transferred to others for use or sold secretly at inflated prices. Violators will have their allocation permanently terminated.</p>

<p>The Public Concession Baojia Self-Defense Corps Youth Department has achieved excellent results since it began physical training this month. Yesterday (the 27th) at 10 AM, a grand ceremony was held at the Racecourse Plaza to mark the start of training. A total of 25 cadres and 355 members from seven districts, including Central, Laoza, Chengdu, Xinzha, Jing'an, Gordon, and Putuo, attended. Chinese and Japanese officials participating in the ceremony included Deputy Chairman Yuan Liden of the Public Works Department, Permanent Director Cheng Zhiliang, Deputy Police Commissioner General Goshima, Deputy Chairman Wang Boyuan of the Baojia Guidance Committee, Director Shigeta of the Baojia Guidance Department, senior staff, chiefs of various police stations, and all Lianbao chiefs within the concession. Japanese military and constitutional authorities and youth groups sent official representatives. The ceremony began at 10 AM, with the Public Works Department band playing music and raising the corps flag. After everyone sang the Youth Department corps song, a moment of silence was observed for the spirits of East Asia. Peng Sijian, chairman of the Youth Department, reported that basic training began last week after the internal establishment last month. Today, everyone is in high spirits and has achieved considerable results. The purpose of the training is (1) to strengthen oneself and (2) to serve the community. He hoped that everyone would continue to work hard to complete the great mission of the Youth Department in the Baojia system. The Chinese and Japanese official representatives, led by Deputy Commissioner General Goshima and Deputy Chairman Wang Boyuan, inspected the members. The members then performed basic training exercises, including standing at attention, resting, turning left and right, turning backward on the spot, and marching. Deputy Chairman Wang Boyuan then gave instructions, saying that efforts should be made to fulfill one's duties and be law-abiding. This training is to strengthen the body and maintain social order, so as to achieve the goal of benefiting oneself and others. He hoped that the short-term training would be completed and that the entire self-defense corps would be trained, expecting the self-defense corps to follow everyone's lead in the future to complete the mission. Thus, today's members are the pioneers of Baojia self-defense. Deputy Commissioner General Goshima then gave instructions, stating that everyone bears the important mission of building a new Shanghai and creating a new history for centuries to come. In the past, due to the evil forces of Britain and the United States, the spirit of youth could not be promoted. The establishment of the Baojia organization this spring, thanks to everyone's efforts, has allowed the people within the concession to live in peace. The Youth Department was created by organizing the Baojia system, and he hoped that everyone would work hard to train, maintain治安, and remove obstacles to complete the Youth Department's mission. The Youth Department's members from various districts then held ball games in rotation for entertainment, and the meeting adjourned at noon.</p>

<p>A letter from young readers, the Ying brothers, states: "The weather is very cold, and the water outside is freezing into ice. Our father (Mr. Ying Yongyu) said: The Shenbao is launching the 100,000 Gold Poverty Relief Movement in the spirit of serving society. Now, the two of us brothers have saved ten yuan from buying candy and toys and are sending it to your newspaper as a donation to support poverty relief. We hope that all the children in the city will save money from buying toys and candy and donate it to newspapers. We also hope that your newspaper will help poor, homeless children so that they don't freeze or starve. From Ying Chun Gao and Ying Chun Tong."</p>
<p>Also, Du Xinwu wrote in a letter that south of the Xuhui Sacred Heart Convent there is a five- or six-year-old boy who is bald, barefoot, and poorly clothed and has been crying from hunger and cold for three days. Presumably, his parents have abandoned him because they cannot afford to raise him. He hopes that the priests there will quickly send him to an orphanage to save his life. Also, Mr. Xinyi generously donated one hundred yuan, bringing the balance to five thousand three hundred thirty-seven yuan.</p>

<p>Datong News Agency reports: This city has again been controlled by a cold wave since yesterday. The temperature has dropped sharply to below zero degrees Celsius.

The porridge distribution station on Wuding Road is being actively planned and opened by Fang Tongshan and Chen Junhong. At the same time, a shelter is also being planned on Yuyuan Road to benefit the poor.</p>
<p>The climate in this city was mild for the past few days, resembling early spring. Since the winter solstice, it has suddenly turned bitterly cold. Last night, the north wind was biting, piercing the skin, and the deep winter weather has arrived, causing many poor and homeless people and beggars to be unable to withstand the hunger and cold and to freeze to death. Within the French Concession, thirty corpses of men, women, and children were found yesterday morning. The police notified the charity to collect and bury them.</p>

<h3 id="e45">Speaking Up for the Baojia Authorities <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— (Lupu Wosheng)</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the Baojia system and the establishment of self-defense corps posts in the two concessions and the Southwestern Municipal area of Shanghai, terror has decreased, petty criminals have disappeared, and local security has become increasingly peaceful. Not only can ordinary citizens live and work in peace, but social order is also well-organized. This is all due to the proper guidance of the various Baojia authorities and the ability of each self-defense corps member to understand the meaning of the Baojia system and its relationship to themselves, so that they can happily work hard in their positions. However, this city has a vast area, a large population, and complex affairs. Regarding all matters of Baojia reform, they will inevitably arise one after another. The Baojia authorities, with their many officials, will be able to coordinate, take a broad view, and see the subtle details, so they will have plenty of room to maneuver. Therefore, I need not be redundant. However, as a member of the self-defense corps, I also bear a part of the responsibility for serving society and maintaining local security. I dare not remain silent about my ignorant opinions. Therefore, I humbly offer my humble opinions on Baojia reform matters, listed below as a small contribution.</p>
<p>(A) Regarding the Baojia Committee: (1) Preparing and Implementing Matters. The organization of the Baojia system in this city is grand, and what should be established and what should be reformed depends on the economy for its driving force. It seems appropriate to organize a unified financial institution (i.e., the Baojia Bank) to facilitate this. At the same time, it should also encourage savings among all levels of staff and self-defense corps members to cultivate a frugal lifestyle. (2) Establish a Baojia Hospital to benefit all levels of staff and self-defense corps members and their families, so that they can enjoy the right to free medical treatment when they encounter illness. (3) Establish a Baojia Free School to cultivate talent. Since this city has been affected by the war, prices are extremely high, and ordinary families already feel difficulty in daily life, let alone the education of their children. It must be known that education is a major undertaking for a hundred years, and cultivating talent is also a top priority. However, for the sake of the generally poor Baojia staff and self-defense corps members who are unable to afford their children's education, it seems necessary to establish a Baojia Free School. (4) Publish a Baojia Daily to facilitate publicity. At the same time, it will be even more conducive to integrating general public opinion in society. Other Baojia laws and regulations and various news can also be widely disseminated, so as not to create isolation. A copy must be posted daily on notice boards in each Baojia street and near the sentry boxes in suitable locations, so that women and children will know, which will be even more effective. (5) Organize job introductions and establish unemployment registration, introducing people based on their talents and selecting the best for employment, so that unemployed members can resolve this kind of pain and feel secure in their positions, so that the efficiency of the Baojia will be greatly increased.</p>
<p>(B) Belonging to the Liaison Office of each District: (1) Add winter coats and raincoats. Among the self-defense corps members, many are in the poor class, and their winter clothing is often insufficient. Whenever it is late at night and it is windy and rainy, those with weak physical strength find it difficult to persevere. Therefore, considering the circumstances, it seems imperative to establish winter coats and raincoats. (2) Add night-time flashlights to facilitate work. (3) Establish opinion boxes to communicate public opinion. (4) The name and address of the person responsible for the alarm key should be marked in a conspicuous place on the alarm, and the same mark should be made at the location of the custodian. (5) The Baojia head's office (shop or residence) should be marked with a wooden sign in a conspicuous place at the door for identification. However, it should not be written on paper to prevent it from easily falling off. (6) Increase secret inspections and attendance checks. If a member is found to have violated the rules, a warning should be given first, then a demerit is recorded for repeated violations, and punishment is given for repeated offenses. Conversely, if a member is found to be energetic and works conscientiously during the service period, they should first be given spiritual encouragement, then a merit is recorded, and a reward is given for accumulated merits to encourage the members' spirit. (7) Practice courtesy, such as when a passer-by asks for directions, give them a warm attitude; (8) Formulate detailed service rules for members and print them in the inspection book and mark them in the sentry box for compliance; (9) The garbage in the sentry box must be cleaned daily, and at the same time, it is forbidden to throw melon skins, fruit shells, phlegm, and the like at will to ensure cleanliness and hygiene. (10) If the armbands and waistbands of each member are worn or damaged, they must be replaced at any time to maintain appearance. (11) If there is a conflict in the guard duty time due to the duties of each member, they should be allowed to adjust the shifts appropriately to avoid affecting their duties.</p>
<p>In summary, what is said above is generally common. Although some of the listed items have already been implemented, there are also some that have not yet been implemented. Please consider them separately to achieve perfection. As far as I can see, I have spoken briefly. I hope that the Baojia gentlemen will correct me.</p>

<p>In the West Union Football League A Group match, Friendship faced Saint Francis. They met at Jiaozhou Park at 3:30 PM yesterday. The referee was Zhang Le. Friendship was at an absolute advantage with a score of 2-0, but Saint Francis broke through twice in a row, forcing a 2-2 draw. The second goal scored by the Saint team was a penalty kick. Zhang Le was impartial and enforced the law like a mountain. Yesterday's draw indirectly created the opportunity for the Righteous Navy to win the championship. In yesterday's game, Friendship first played with ten players. After a quarter of an hour, Meng Yiliang arrived and joined the battle. At 28 minutes, Fei Chunhua picked up the ball, Wu Qixiang passed it in the middle, and Zhuo Shijin knocked on the door. Yivano bounced it out with his chest. Zhuo rushed up and shot again, breaking through the goal and returning. Friendship took the lead with a score of 1-0 in the first half. When the battle started again, after twenty-seven minutes, Sun Jinshun took a long shot 30 yards from the back, and the ball hit Schultz's heel and rolled towards the goal. Ivano did not defend and watched it enter the net, making it 2-0. Ten minutes later, Fuen handed over Bao Za, who swept and scored, pulling back a goal. In the last two minutes, Fuen cut in and Liu Xianhan jumped up to catch it, but at this time, Zhang Lingen suddenly knocked Carrolie down, and a penalty was called. Fuen took the penalty and kicked it into the net. Time was up, and the two sides drew with a score of 2-2. In another game in the morning, the French Chamber of Commerce easily defeated Suke by a score of 4-0.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Naval Warfare: A Dialogue <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Naval Shipbuilding Vice Admiral: Kiyoshi Nagamura</p>
<p>Former Principal of Tokyo Higher Merchant Marine School: Kunihiko Sugawa</p>
<p>Asahi Weekly Reporter</p>
<p>Translated from the December 27th Issue of Asahi Weekly</p>
<p>Reporter: In such a large war, no matter which side you stand on, it is by no means just a military battle, but rather a manifestation of various forms of warfare, the most prominent of which is the so-called naval warfare. Today, I would like to seek your insights on this aspect.</p>
<p>From late July to late October of this year, according to the announcements of ships sunk by Japanese Navy submarines, although many enemy ships have been sunk, Japan's sacrifices have also been quite significant. Is there no way to prevent these losses due to submarine attacks?</p>
<p>Nagamura: The weapons used by the United States in guerrilla warfare are submarines and airplanes. Speaking of submarines, they were first used in warfare during the last World War, when Germany used this new weapon to disrupt trade and achieved great results, which was recognized by the navies of various countries. Even Britain dared not treat it lightly. Naval Marshal Jellicoe and others were deeply concerned about future submarine warfare. Therefore, Germany was very advanced in the use of submarines, and also conducted considerable research on methods of defending against submarines. In this current war, compared to the last war, the methods of submarine defense and attack have reached a groundbreaking level of progress. Furthermore, the use of other scientific advancements, such as using ultra-shortwave radio to detect the location of submarines, has also developed. Therefore, offense and defense are closely chasing each other. Because both sides are progressing, submarine guerrilla warfare is also developing accordingly.</p>
<p>Reporter: Judging from the number of enemy ships sunk by Germany, it is almost one million tons per month. Therefore, in light of the sinking of ships due to submarine attacks, it seems increasingly necessary to build more ships.</p>
<p>Nagamura: Building is one solution, preventing sinking is also a solution.</p>
<p>Sugawa: Speaking of ways to prevent sinking, there are methods of attack and defense, as well as detecting the location of submarines. However, what is the target of the guerrilla warfare that the enemy is desperately carrying out now? In the end, it is nothing more than merchant ships. Needless to say, warships are also their target, but warships have complete defenses. For example, small anti-submarine escorts are specifically designed to combat submarines. Therefore, submarines can only target merchant ships with very little defensive capabilities.</p>
<p>However, using merchant ships to transport goods is indispensable in wartime. They carry extremely important materials or necessities indispensable for the lives of the people. Therefore, ever since the First World War more than twenty years ago, it has become common sense that sinking merchant ships one by one can defeat the enemy. Merchant ships, in other words, maritime transport, are essential for achieving victory in war. The fact that ships determine the fate of a nation is even more evident in this war. Therefore, the Axis powers' navies or aircraft sink more than a million tons of ships every month for this very purpose. Although I am not an expert in tactics, I understand the principle that Germany does not need to land troops on British soil; as long as the tonnage of British ships is reduced to a certain level, Britain will be defeated. Therefore, they are intensifying their efforts to sink them.</p>
<p>Various Tactics to Counter Submarines</p>
<p>Therefore, merchant ships have also adopted various defense methods, such as so-called convoy sailing, where many ships are gathered together, and a powerful fleet follows to protect their voyage. However, this method did not seem very effective in the last European war. At that time, only one warship protected many armed merchant ships, but now it has been changed to using a large fleet for escort. However, the target of the enemy's guerrilla warfare is merchant ships sailing alone. To avoid being attacked, merchant ships have also been equipped with some kind of armament, but it is not comparable to the armament of warships. Therefore, the enemy uses them as targets. Recently, the headquarters announced that twenty-some Japanese ships have been damaged, and I think they were also targeted by this kind of guerrilla warfare. There is no other way but to quickly discover the enemy. If a torpedo is launched, air bubbles will rise to the surface of the water, forming a "white line" rushing over. By the time you discover this white line and realize that a torpedo has been launched, you know that a submarine is following. Therefore, there is no other way but to quickly discover the enemy and use your own guns to bombard them. There have already been examples of defeating the enemy using this method. There are also ways to avoid torpedoes because torpedoes drag a white line as they come. Therefore, you can quickly turn the rudder to avoid them. Also, if a submarine surfaces, you can use guns to bombard it, but the other party is very small, while you are very large, and the other party will not surface for you to see.</p>
<p>Therefore, judging from the guerrilla warfare in the United States, one cannot help but think that there are enemies everywhere along the Japanese coast. Therefore, whether a ship is in a Japanese port, or far away in the south, or in other ports, once it leaves the port, it cannot help but feel that there are enemy submarines lurking in the water, or mechanical mines installed, or floating on the surface. Therefore, people on merchant ships, whether crew or passengers, are really sailing at great risk.</p>
<p>Reporter: Is it possible to consider building ships with considerable speed so that the ships themselves are not afraid of submarine attacks? This is very necessary. This is not only good in terms of defense.</p>
<p>Nagamura: Needless to say, making the speed of merchant ships extremely fast is very necessary. This is not only a good method in terms of defense, but it is also a kind of attack power. However, if merchant ships are fully armed and have sufficient defensive capabilities, then merchant ships will become warships. Perhaps a few guns are missing, but they will still become almost like warships. In this way, the transport capacity will be greatly reduced. It is a solution, but quickly discovering the enemy is the most important thing.</p>
<p>Sugawa: Quickly discovering the enemy is certainly necessary. Similarly, it is also necessary not to be discovered by the enemy. Although it is a passive method, in the European war more than twenty years ago, there were already examples of merchant ships not emitting smoke. Therefore, there is a saying that "residual smoke is the cause of trouble." Even a thin wisp of smoke rising above the horizon will reveal that a ship is coming. Therefore, in dangerous waters where submarines are lurking, smokeless coal is used instead of bituminous coal during the day. This is a way to prevent the enemy from discovering you quickly. Also, masts are also annoying because they extend high above the ship and can be seen from afar. Even a mast as thin as a hair can be seen on the horizon, indicating that a ship is coming. Therefore, some people cut long masts short. The same goes for chimneys. Also, making the structures on the upper part of the deck small and low is also for this reason. These are means of preventing the enemy from discovering you. As for the night, blackout measures are adopted, that is, all the lights on the ship are completely extinguished, and navigation is carried out in darkness. There have also been ships sunk because of a slight leak of light. For example, a person smoking a cigarette on deck, even though the fire of the cigarette is very small, almost like a firefly, was hit by a torpedo and sank. There really have been such ships.</p>
<p>The Problem of Camouflage</p>
<p>Another solution is not to use wireless radio. Using wireless radio is extremely dangerous. The wireless radio that is sent out will be heard by others, just like speaking loudly will be heard by people nearby. If a wireless radio is sent out from a ship, any ship equipped with wireless radio equipment can hear it. After hearing it, using a direction finder to investigate can detect the location. Also, one should not speak loudly or ring bells on the ship. Avoiding these things is a way for merchant ships to protect themselves. Also, it is very dangerous to throw things that can float on the sea, such as oil and garbage, into the sea. Especially when many ships are traveling together, if you throw these things into the sea, these oil and garbage will follow the ship, dragging a long tail. Then, the traces of your passage will be left on the sea surface, which can be immediately discovered by the enemy. Therefore, any garbage that can be burned should be burned at night, and those that cannot be burned should be hammered firmly and thrown into the seabed. This method must be considered. Next is the issue of speed, but this is really the weapon of the ship. Comparing it to land, the guerrilla warfare of submarines is like a person walking in the wilderness being chased by wild dogs. Therefore, if that person runs fast, he can escape; if he does not run fast, he will be bitten by the dogs.</p>
<p>In the First European War, by the middle of the war, 15 million tons of ships had been sunk. According to statistics at that time, about half of the ships with a speed of about 12 knots were discovered by the enemy but managed to escape, and half were sunk. As for ships with a speed of about 6 knots, 100% were sunk. As for ships with a speed of 18 knots or more, only 3% were sunk, and the rest escaped the danger. Also, the fact that they were able to escape the danger because they discovered the enemy first or were discovered by the enemy first, or were unable to escape the danger, was also generally published in that statistic. Therefore, the saying that speed is a weapon is correct.</p>
<p>Next is the issue of camouflage. The so-called camouflage issue is the method of applying camouflage to the ship or changing the structure of the ship. In the previous war, there was already considerable research on this. For example, the Japanese ship "Hakuto Maru" also had camouflage. At that time, a thick line was drawn from the stern to the bow, like an upward arrow. In this way, after drawing a line behind the real bow, it looks like the bow. Therefore, the submarine made a mistake in direction at night, thinking that it was going in the opposite direction, and launched a torpedo, thus avoiding disaster. This seems a bit tricky. There have also been examples of drawing a destroyer on the side of a large ship so that it looks like there is a destroyer escorting it from a distance.</p>
<p>A Bomb Penetrates the Opposite Side</p>
<p>Nagamura: Regarding the camouflage just mentioned, the other side is also trying their best, so there are many mistakes. Another way is to sail in waters that submarines cannot reach. Another way is to sail in shallow waters or places close to land during the day where submarines cannot dive, and then sail in dangerous places at night. In addition, there are various methods, but using these passive methods only defends yourself. A further method is to use artillery to attack. Also, when encountering the enemy at extremely close range and there is no way out, the only thing to do is to scuttle the ship. There have also been such examples recently. In April of this year, there was a ship, the 〇〇 Maru, that scuttled itself in the evening. At that time, the submarine was floating and launched a torpedo, but the 〇〇 Maru avoided the torpedo and scuttled itself. Another method is to make the defense very weak and try to escape. For example, the Sado Maru was saved in this way in the Russo-Japanese War. At that time, the ship was hit by a bomb on the starboard side, but it penetrated the port side. The bomb happened to hit the coal bunker. Because the bomb had penetrated, water entered from both sides at the same time, so it sank evenly and straight, thus being saved. Originally, the power of the explosive is stronger the stronger the object it hits, and the easier it is to deal with if it hits a weaker object.</p>
<p>Sugawa: Next, let's talk about lookout. This is a very tense lookout. And this so-called lookout does not only refer to the lookout with the eyes, but rather the use of human senses... and even the sixth sense as much as possible. You must look out in all directions, front, back, left, and right. In recent years, you must also look at the sky, and you must have a three-dimensional lookout of the water, the surface of the water, and the sky. So it is very tense.</p>
<p>Also, in the last European war, great attention was paid to seagulls on the sea surface. Everyone knows that seagulls follow whales or schools of fish. Whales chase and swim to eat baleen whales and other small animals. Therefore, where there are baleen whales, there must be whales, and where there are whales, there are also birds. Moreover, seagulls also follow submarines. Therefore, where there are many seagulls gathered, there may be submarines hiding. There are many examples of using the habits of marine animals in war like this. The following is a story from the last European War.</p>
<p>At that time, a certain country used sea lions. Sea lions are a type of seal. After training and taming them, they can be used. During training, they are not given food to make them hungry. Then, submarines are moored near the coast for the sea lions to watch. Then, the submarine's engine is turned on, making a "rumbling" sound. At this time, the sea lions are fed so that they know that when the submarine's engine is turned on, they can get food. Then, the submarine is driven away from the coast, and the sea lions are left on land. Then, the submarine's engine is turned on again. When the sea lions hear the engine sound, they think they can get food, and they immediately jump into the sea and swim to the submarine. After swimming to the submarine, they are given food. Again, the submarine dives into the water, and the sea lions are carried in a small motorboat. A red float the size of a cigarette is tied to the sea lions' bodies. When the submarine turns on its engine and dives, the sea lions immediately jump into the sea and swim towards the diving submarine. The small motorboat follows the sea lions' floats. By training sea lions in this way, using their innate hearing, they are able to find the location of submarines. After the location of the submarine is known, the sea lions are pulled up, and then a depth charge is launched. That method has been used before.</p>
<p>The United States' Shipbuilding Should Not Be Underestimated</p>
<p>Reporter: Although there are those defense methods, in the end, you still cannot avoid suffering considerable damage from submarines. Then, the so-called naval warfare has to be formally adopted. Is it possible that the United States can build eight million tons of ships per year?</p>
<p>Nagamura: I don't know if it's true. However, the so-called eight million tons in the United States refers to dead weight, while the sunken ships are expressed in tons. Therefore, the number of tons built should be more than the number of tons sunk. Comparing the two, the number of tons built should be discounted by 30%. Therefore, the so-called eight million tons built should actually be regarded as within six million tons. However, there is no doubt that they are trying their best to build them.

<h3 id="e52">Frugal Plans for Oil and Sugar <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Wen</p>
<p>There are probably not many people who can eat plain rice. They still have to eat some side dishes with their rice, no matter how much or how good the side dishes are.</p>
<p>It also doesn't seem very good to cook vegetables with just water. You still have to use some oil. For the sake of color and taste, you have to add some sugar. People in Shanghai especially like fatty and sweet side dishes. So you can't do without oil and sugar when cooking side dishes (we are not discussing nutrition here).</p>
<p>Currently in Shanghai, you have to "squeeze" to buy oil and sugar. What if you can't squeeze? Rich people have ways. Lard can be freely purchased, both raw and cooked, at twenty-some yuan per catty. However, animal oil is not as fatty as vegetable oil for cooking, and it solidifies when cold. Vegetable oil is still indispensable. A friend of mine told me that a family bought fifty catties of vegetable oil from a secret market at a price of twenty-five yuan per catty, totaling one thousand two hundred and fifty yuan! As for sugar, the sub-landlord can buy forty yuan worth of sugar at a time with the rent donation ticket, whether or not to distribute it to the tenants is another matter. If not, there may still be ways to buy rock sugar. Only those families who can barely afford to eat a bowl of rice and a small side dish are troubled. The housewife has no oil and no sugar for cooking, so she can only sigh at the pot. As for those who can't even afford to eat, oil and sugar have become problems they can't even worry about.</p>
<p>Recently, I have gained interesting experiences from those friends who are good at planning: they use fried dough sticks to stir-fry vegetables and add sweet potatoes to flour to make cakes, just to get some oil and taste some sweetness (eating sweet potatoes alone is another matter). Poor friends really have their frugal plans!</p>
<h3 id="e53">This Month <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan Liduan</p>
<p>— Written by a fifteen-year-old child —</p>
<p>Although the sun that rises from the east every morning is still the same as yesterday's, and its shape has never changed for tens of millions of years, you cannot deny that this is a new day just because its appearance will not change, and you must tear off your calendar.</p>
<p>The calendar is torn page by page, torn and torn, and one book after another is torn. I don't know how many calendars have been torn since the beginning of time. Now, the calendar for the 31st year hanging on the wall is about to be torn off, leaving only a few thin pages. The time when sweet osmanthus fragrantly falls and chrysanthemums are yellow and crabs are fat has passed in the blink of an eye. It seems like the road signs on the road of life have quickly gone far away, getting smaller and smaller, and finally disappearing. What is blocking in front is the cold winter at the end of the year with the biting north wind.</p>
<p>Facing December, this end of the year, what kind of feelings will you have? Perhaps you will let out a sigh of "What, another year has passed?" and feel infinite emotion about the fleeting years. You feel that this year has really been wasted, and there has been no harvest or significant progress in any aspect. And time is pressing, and in the blink of an eye, you will be growing older in vain. Perhaps looking at this remaining calendar, you will lazily lose the motivation to do anything. "Let it be! Anyway, the year is about to end. Whatever needs to be done, leave it for next year. You can't do anything in this short period of time."</p>
<p>At the beginning of each period, we always deal with it with great concentration. However, even at the end, we should not be slack in the slightest. This month allows us to reflect on what we have done in the past year to serve as a mirror for the next year; on the other hand, it also allows us to set a plan for the coming year so that we can start working on it in a down-to-earth manner as soon as the year begins.</p>
<p>The situation is just like the presentation of a film's title card. Everyone wants to talk about the plot of the film and the acting skills of the leading actors. If anyone doesn't know, he cannot be called a fashionable person. But the presentation of the film only arouses the appreciation and attention of a part of the people. There are many people who are willing to be out of fashion and ignore it. But the fashion of talking about the rice problem is much better than a film masterpiece. This grand occasion is really unprecedented, and from this unprecedented grand occasion, we can see how serious the rice problem is. Especially after entering this month, the price of rice has been rising endlessly. Adding to the unavailability of oil and sugar, it is really difficult for people in Shanghai to live.</p>
<p>The most helpless, of course, are those poor people. Under the high pressure of life, they have long been on the verge of death. How can they withstand the attack of the cold? Hunger is burning their hearts, the north wind is piercing their bones, and they are groaning and moaning. They are pitiful worms who spend their mornings and evenings as if they were years. They are everywhere on the streets. I don't believe that they are all people who did not cultivate themselves in their previous lives. Which of these shivering and crying people is not our sister or brother? We are compatriots and cannot bear to see them die. Alas! "How can I get ten thousand rooms to shelter all the poor people in the world and make them happy!" Although Du Fu had such a heart, he did not have such strength, so it was futile. Now there must be many people in society who have this power. Who would be willing to help others as they would help themselves, to extend the wish to relieve all sufferings and save all people? I am really filled with sincere prayers!</p>
<p>In this month, there is naturally no vitality in the natural world. There is no abundance of peaches and plums, no beauty of peonies and peonies, no freshness of lotus, no charm of chrysanthemums; even the subtle fragrance of plum blossoms is still not heard. Why don't we sow and irrigate our sympathy and love at any time, so that it can sprout, grow, and bloom beautiful and delicate flowers in the cold, icy, frosty, and bare December?

<h3 id="e54">Memories of Yantai <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— You Guiying</p>
<p>Yantai, what a symbolic name! Here, the heavens do not like to rain, but love to blow the wind. Sitting quietly in a small room, listening carefully to the pine waves like the cries of monkeys and tigers, it is like being surrounded by hundreds of beasts, which makes people shudder. Wandering on the hillside in the early morning, what is presented in front of you is like a kaleidoscope of changes. The thin mist shrouds the sleepy high mountains, and the floating clouds densely cover the vast and boundless sea. The drunken wind embraces the dancing yellow sand, and the solitary chimneys spit out black demons from their mouths, forming long snakes in the sky. Smoke, clouds, fog, and sand form a gray world.</p>
<p>Liugong Island is simple, bold, tragic, and deep; Zhifu Mountain is beautiful, gentle, clear, and winding. The yellow sand of Xisha Bay is better than the vast Gobi Desert, and the cherry blossoms of Sincun are no different from a paradise. The charming Yantai Mountain overlooks the majestic Yantai Mountain, like a beautiful woman and a hero, complementing each other. The Yantai Middle School, known as the highest institution of learning, occupies the peak of Yuhuangding alone, seemingly disregarding everything and arrogant.</p>
<p>On a moonlit night, strolling on the long dyke of Bohai Bay, appreciating the high tides of more than ten feet, surging and vast, overwhelming the mountains and seas, one will naturally feel the greatness and wonder of nature.</p>
<p>Often on a calm morning, in the faint white mist, you can actually see miracles such as "castles in the air" or "mirages."</p>
<p>Although Yantai is not as rich as Qingdao, it has a simple charm. Those slow camels, simple people, and majestic mountains and rivers will always give me endless memories.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Correction of the Location of Lu Xun's Tomb <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Yan</p>
<p>In Mr. Baihong's "Street Anecdotes" on December 23, the origins of the names of roads and statues of gods and figures of foreigners in the concession are described in detail, which is helpful for understanding the anecdotes and history of Shanghai. I am deeply impressed. The stone statues in front of the stables on the Mahe Road and Jing'an Temple Road, which are said to be the Weng Zhong in front of Lu Xun's tomb, and the area is said to be the site of Lu Xun's tomb, cannot but be doubted. According to: Lu Xun, whose style name was Boyan, lived in the Three Kingdoms period; Lu Shen, whose style name was Yanshan, lived in the Ming Hongzhi period. Shen's pronunciation is close to Xun, so the people of the county often mistakenly attributed the deeds of the local predecessors to Lu Boyan, not knowing that the times were separated by nearly 1,300 years. According to today's research, Lu Xun's tomb is in Hengyun Mountain, and Lu Shen's tomb is in Pudong, which has nothing to do with the cemetery next to Jing'an Temple. Lu Xun's position is not comparable to that of Cao Cao, so it is not necessary to set up another tomb outside the main tomb. Moreover, the style of the stone statues is completely different from the statues of the Han and Jin Dynasties, which can be seen at a glance. I am afraid that if it is not carefully examined, the truth of the facts will be contradicted, so I correct it.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Sharing a Boat in Stormy Weather <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>12. "The Rear Courtyard Flower"</p>
<p>Wei Cheng said, "We have things to say, let's talk after we leave the city streets."  He said this and ran straight ahead, with Huang Long following behind. Neither of them spoke a word. In the blink of an eye, they reached the edge of the city, and some dawn light was beginning to appear in the east. Wei Cheng sat down beside an old tree with tangled roots by the roadside and shook his head, saying, "I'm afraid I've bled too much." He raised his arm for Huang Long to see. Huang Long showed no pity for him and didn't sit down either, but exhaled and said, "Too much bleeding? Who told you to bleed?" Wei Cheng said, "I was thinking..." Huang Long said, "You've been thinking for days, and you're still thinking? Fine, you're willing to use your own flesh to replace the flesh of those little bastards surnamed Cheng. This is what you've thought up after so many days. No need for further words, the knife is mine, not yours, and I can't let you use my knife to stab your flesh. Give it here!" Huang Long didn't even bother to ask for Wei Cheng's agreement and took the knife from Wei Cheng's hand, smelling it on his nose. Wei Cheng turned his head and called out, "Brother Long," Huang Long replied, "Goodbye, Brother Long." Huang Long walked forward without any reluctance. Wei Cheng held one hand over the wound on the other arm, stood up, and called out, "Brother Long, where are you going?" Huang Long didn't answer, but kept walking forward.</p>
<p>How could Wei Cheng outpace Huang Long? At first, they were only a few yards apart, but gradually the distance grew to more than ten yards, and gradually only a shadow could be seen, and gradually even the shadow disappeared. Wei Cheng looked at his body in the dawn light, but couldn't see any obvious bloodstains, and he couldn't walk as fast as before. As he walked, he thought, "Did Guo Fang open her eyes for a moment just now? I wonder if she woke up in her sleep and saw me and Huang Long? Assuming she saw me and Huang Long, she would definitely have cried out. Since there was no sound, she must not have seen us." Thinking this, Wei Cheng felt a little calmer and ran forward again. Then he thought, "He suddenly remembered that when Huang Long stabbed the knife down, it pierced through the quilt of Guo Qi; the second knife stabbed into my arm, and my blood flowed out at that moment. Guo Fang's bed must also be stained with blood, so Guo Fang's surprise when she wakes up is self-evident. Moreover, the door was opened and not closed, so it can be said that she will think that there was an assassin, no matter what."</p>

<h3 id="e57">Darwin's Letters on Biology (Part Two) <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— Lincoln Schuster, Translated by Gu Xin</p>
<p>—One of the Letters of World Famous Scientists—</p>
<p>On October 15, 1859, Darwin wrote to Thomas Huxley from Yorkshire, saying: "I am here undergoing water treatment. After I finished that cursed book (On the Origin of Species), I was reborn. This book may be easy work for others, but for me, it almost cost me half my life... I dare not ask you to believe my many heresies."</p>
<p>Finally, in 1859, Darwin's epoch-making masterpiece was finally published in 1859. The title of the book is "On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection" or "Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle of Life." The first edition of 1,250 copies was sold out on the day of publication.</p>
<p>In the following letter, we can roughly see the examination, verification, and creative thinking in all of Darwin's work.</p>
<p>"Determined to publish a small essay on the origin of mankind..."</p>
<p>Text</p>
<p>My Dear Wallace,—Bates is quite right: you are the person others turn to when they encounter difficulties. Apart from your opinion (note), I have never heard a more ingenious opinion, and I hope you can prove its truth. Speaking of the facts about white moths, it is very touching, and seeing a theory almost being proven really warms the blood. Regarding the beauty of male butterflies, I still want to think that this is for sexual selection. Dragonflies are all attracted by bright colors, and there is some evidence; however, what causes the above belief is that many orthopteran and cicada-like animals have musical organs. For this reason, I also believe that in sexual selection, the situation of birds is the same as the color of insects. I hope I have the strength and time to do the several experiments you want to show, but I think butterflies cannot be detained. I have indeed heard of such difficulties. Many years ago, I had a dragonfly painted with bright colors, but I never had the opportunity to test it properly.</p>
<p>Now I feel a great interest in sexual selection, because I have almost decided to publish a small essay on the origin of mankind, and I still strongly think (although I cannot make you believe, and this point is the most important possible blow to me), that sexual selection is the active agent in forming the human race.</p>
<p>By the way, here is another topic that I want to introduce into my essay, that is, the expression of the face. Now, by chance, do you know a very kind, clever observer in the Malay Sea who can give me some convenient opinions on the faces of Malays when they are aroused by emotions? If there is such a person, I will send him a questionnaire. Thank you for your most interesting letter.</p>
<p>Most Sincerely Yours, Charles Darwin</p>
<p>Down, February 26, (1867)</p>
<p>(Note) Those butterfly moths and butterflies are not eaten by birds because they are easily recognized and easily discarded, so they are preserved.</p>
<p>Consequences</p>
<p>One year after this letter was written, in 1868, Darwin greatly expanded on the topic discussed in this letter and wrote an article entitled "Variations of Animals and Plants Under Domestication." Finally, "The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex" was also published by Darwin in 1871, which was also a problem touched upon in this letter written in 1867.</p>
<p>Regarding religion, Darwin said: "The feeling of disbelief entered my heart at a very slow pace, but finally it was completed. The progress was so slow that I did not feel pain." (End of this issue)</p>
