<h3>四、宗教聖地巴勒斯坦</h3>
<p>究竟是怎樣的一個樂土呢？</p>
<p>巴勒斯坦西瀕地中海，北界叙里亞，西南界埃及，東為外約但與外約但河為界。面積約九千方哩，人口約一百萬，約當我國江蘇省的四分之一。牠的地勢，是四面較高，中間低下。最低之處，就是死海。死海水面低於海平面一千三百呎，是世界最低的水面。死海的水，含有鹽分甚多，魚類不能生活，故稱死海。因為含礦物多，所以死海海水的比重，為一.二。人在死海水中，很易浮起。可無溺死之虞。死海海水中的礦鹽，以鉀鹽為最多。所以自從第一次世界大戰以後，英國招猶太人回巴勒斯坦故鄉，猶太人就設法在死海海水中提取鉀索，很有成績。德國對於死海海水中的鉀鹽，也頗為注意。</p>
<p>死海為狹長形，長四十六哩闊平均八哩，含鹽分百分之二十五。有人估計，其中礦鹽可有炭酸鉀十萬萬噸，溴素八萬五千萬噸，　　一百萬萬餘噸，氣化鎂二百萬萬餘噸。</p>
<p>巴勒斯坦的物產，就農產方面言，有大麥，小麥，橄欖，無花果，阿勒伯棗，葡萄，桔子，檸檬等等，就礦產方面言，有石材石膏鹽等，沿海漁業頗盛。丘陵區盛行畜牧，以山羊綿羊及　陀為大宗。</p>
<p>論到巴勒斯坦的交通，陸有鐵路縱貫。其通開羅一段，為第一次歐戰時英人的軍用鐵路。第一次歐戰時，英人攻土耳其的海峽不能得手，就設法一面從阿刺伯牛島方面，以游擊戰術牽制土耳其的軍隊，一面由愛　璧將軍率領英軍，從埃及越過西奈半島直達巴勒斯坦，動搖了土耳其帝國的軍事形勢，就走的這一條鐵路。至於海路，則有下述的約發海發二埠，為外海航路的中心。</p>
<p>巴勒斯坦的居民，阿剌伯人佔八分之六，猶太人佔八分之一。在英國人的幫助之下，猶太人的人數繼續在那裏增加，難怪阿刺伯人要見而寒心。他們的數字，從一九二〇年的五萬八千人，增至一九三一年的十四萬人。全世界的猶太人，計有一千六百萬人，這裏已有了十分之一了。</p>
<p>這裏有聖城耶路撒冷，—基督敎徒的聖城，也是回敎徒的聖城。－今為委任統治地的首都，它們於巴力斯坦的中部。死海的西北，建於高出海面二千五百餘呎的山頂上。這裏有伯利恒（Bethlehe　　），是耶穌基督的出生處。這裏的人民，以宗示敎來分，有信奉猶太敎的猶太人，有信奉基督敎的基督徒，有信奉回敎的叙里亞人。</p>
<p>它的重要港口，有約發和海發。約發在耶路撒冷的西北瀕海，且有鐵路與耶城相近。四方來朝拜聖地者，多由此登陸。附近產橘甚多，均由此輸出。海發在約發之北，，瀕海也有鐵路相通，也是一個重要商港。自從英國經營蘇油田（在伊拉克）以來，建有一千餘哩的油管，直通海發，石油即在海發，自油管移上運油船，非常便利，所以海發是加一　的重要了。</p>
<p>巴勒斯可分為二帶，　沿海是肥沃的地中海區，出產桔子和其他果子。　邱陵帶，則是耶路撒冷的所在地，冬令頗為寒冷，出產橄欖叢樹。　深谷地區，即是約河海和死海的所在地，這裏天氣又頗暖熱</p>

<p>上海電力公司為本埠公用事業之一、其所供電力、即為上海生產活動之原動力、故其電力之分配方法、殊堪重視、去年末該公司因煤斤缺乏、曾對於一切生產需電或消費需電、概行限制、减少供給、</p>
<p>限制方法</p>
<p>當初限制方法、以去年度消費量為根據、其配電率如下、　交通及公用事業七成、　建築物及住宅六成、　工業四成半、　奢侈品四成半、　娛樂四成半、其後日軍進駐租界、該公司亦受其管理、但對於此項分配方法、並不更改、</p>

<h3>康脫凡第輪　展期載僑離滬　定本月二十三日啓程六進五十人搭輪撤退</h3>

<p>撒退名單不斷修正駐華美國、加拿大及南美　國之外交領事官員、雖已由關係當局宜稱、定於本月中離滬赴葡屬東菲洲、對換集合該地之日本官員、但實際情形、日當局暨瑞士駐滬總領署、均拒不發表、據稱業已編就之撤退人名單、徵諸瑞士副領事希齡博士、此一名單將不斷修改、以迄成行前之最後一分鐘為止、因目下決定准予撤退者、屆時未必撤退、今將名單發表、反引起種種不安及失望之情緖、</p>
<p>若干細則有待商決惟、般外僑人七相信、本月中或將撒退之協約國籍官員、其數恐不及六百五十人、因其中大部份為來自華北華南各埠之普通人民、最近數日來、自平、津、靑島、濟南、芝罘、南京等地來滬集合待撤者、絡繹不絕、一向僑居滬凟之美國人民等、雖有準備行裝萬一徹退者、但大多數人均懷疑是否亦有撒退之可能性、就事案之整個發展觀之、關於互換官民事、定有若干最後細則、尙懸而未決、以至陰霾迄未廓淸、</p>
<p>康脫凡第試行日本至於定於月中中滬放菲之義郵輪康脫凡第號、於星期日晚突然駛日後、各方頗多揣測、惟較為可靠一致之意見、即為該輪似巳為日海軍當局所租、此次駛日為檢騐船身及機器、返滬時可能將留日協約國官員載來、待滬美加等官民登輪後、一同載往東菲洲、固該輪艙位甚多、儘够容納、至於英國官員撤退、瑞士副領事稱、待下月內日郵船龍田丸或鎌倉丸有自滬駛往東菲之可能時、再行考慮云、</p>

<h3>鷹爪手，不夜眼，獅面，裂膚……麻瘋人生活寫眞</h3>
<p>— 家良</p>
<p>盡心盡力求生勇氣依然助已助人友愛精神洋溢</p>
<p>在這樣一個複雜繁華，充滿了刺激和興奮的大都巿生活中，男女老幼的動態會合成一般不斷的人底洪流，誰亦不會想到在同地方的另一角，有一羣人因為生理的缺陷，在渡着與世隔離的生活。他們不是受到戰爭影響顚沛流離的難民，亦不是遭社會奚落輕視的乞丐而是身患傳染惡疾，不得不與外界隔絕的麻瘋病人。</p>
<p>他們被收容在滬西白利南路上的中華麻瘋醫院內。全數共一百零八人，其中有年可十三四黃毛未退的小伙子，亦有七十古來稀的老翁；有受過大都會風光洗禮的所謂摩登姑娘，亦有粗戇似乎有些半開化的鄕下老太婆；有終日聖經不離手開口上帝閉口悔改的牧師，有畫家，有作家，亦有目不識丁「一字當作橫劃」的低能。他們來自不同的背景，有不同的信仰，不同的與趣，和一切不同的不同：但是生港同樣的病，隔離在同一的醫院裏，受同樣的待遇，過同樣的生活。</p>
<p>醫院雖非高樓大廈，而祗是茅屋數橡。麻雀雖小，五臟俱全。淮門處前埭房屋為通道，藥房，紡織室，辦公室及圖書室等。院中為大天井，兩側為男女病人。男病人共七十三名，視病情輕重，分居兩室，其中患肺病者因恐傳染，復另行隔離。女病人二十九名，另居一室。天井正中為禮堂，堂簷下懸紅色大十字架一座。堂內可容納數白人，壁懸鏡框一隻，上書「基督為此院之主」。天井之左前方為診療室，洗衣處和廚房。禮堂後又為空地，闢為種植畜牧之塲。</p>
<p>這「一百零八將」的日常生活，雖然未由醫院當局規律嚴格，但出於自動的紀律倒是値得提的。除了病重的　得躺在床上由人服侍外，其餘的至少都能自己料理一切。洗衣，紡紗、木工、養鴿、養豬。看　、收拾。打掃等等，都由麻瘋人分工辦理。智職程度較高的還自願作義務敎授，幫助院內一般文盲；有的擅於寫作，聯合幾個同志辦一種名叫「晨光季刋」的雜誌，是麻瘋院的喉舌；有的提倡「勞動服務」，用石板舖成院內平坦的路；有的個別編結織物，經院方消毒後，向外出售，聊以自給。他們絕不因生理上的不健全而减少求生的勇氣，他們還儘量利用尙未被麻瘋剝一的技能和智力，自助，互助，充滿友愛精神，建造他們自己的世界。</p>
<p>淸晨，一部份麻瘋人聚集在禮堂中禮拜讀經。他們不忘追求精神上的力量與安慰，來消彌肉體上的不足和痛苦。他們的寢食亦是很講究的。單人彈簧床，白白的後單，厚厚的墊褥。吃的每日三頓，早粥或摻麩皮或混赤豆，午餐一湯兩菜，都用分食制。每年聖誕節他們屠宰自己所畜養的豬，儘量的吃一頓。</p>

<h3>銀幕上的標準夫人</h3>
<p>— 陶順聖</p>
<p>茂娜洛埃離婚有感</p>
<p>憶一九三六年，好萊塢影星茂娜洛埃，與劇作者兼製片家霍勃魯亞瑟結婚了。當時他曾發表一篇關於、夫人」的「標準一見解：『男子對於女性是絕對的柔弱的，他們不能抵抗異性的進攻，於是做妻子的就免不了遭遇到同性的競爭。婚前的競爭是初步的，婚後的競爭是大規模的長期的。本來，愛情是自私的，可是這自私應該是一種諒解的自私。婚姻的另外一種代名詞該是快樂。如果愁苦，抑鬰，猜忌等成分，慢慢地侵蝕到婚姻的園地裹來，這婚姻是必然失敗的。」</p>
<p>在好萊塢女星中，茂娜洛埃是以標準夫人聞名的。好萊塢的新聞記者更告訴我們：她在私生活方面，和在銀幕上一樣，是一個典型的夫人。可是消息傳來，木月一日茂娜在里諾與霍勃魯離婚了。想必是婚姻的園地裏有了愁苦抑鬰的成分。</p>
<p>然而茂娜到底是勇敢的，第一次大規模的長期的競爭剛結束，她馬上就開始了第二次的長期競爭　　據紐約電訊：茂娜在離婚後第五天上（本月六日）又已與某著名廣吿公司協理哈資約翰結婚。不知道我們這位銀幕上的標準夫人在揭開道一次長期競爭的序幕時，有沒有競爭到底的準備與決心？</p>
<h3>中國舞劇社演「五生星」與「印度舞」</h3>
<p>— 農</p>
<p>「中國舞劇一是要先採取中國舊劇中的舞姿，用情節貫串起來，藉音樂來幫助舞蹈，把心聲傳達給觀衆，是耳與目的欣賞。實際上比較主要的是音樂，舞不過是幫助音樂的瞭解。這在歐洲，被稱為Ballet，是世界上最高雅的一種藝術，因為它不用言語，所以又是最有國際性的一種藝術。如果要把一個民族藝術宣揚到世界上去，這是最直接的一種手段。在美國，在蘇聯，舞劇所處的地位都很高。</p>
<p>中國舞劇社在去年所演出「古剎驚夢」也是民間抽象的故事。該社是幾個對於中國舞劇的創立，對於中國音樂的發揚有着深厚興趣的人所結合的。其中作曲者阿父夏洛穆夫，遠在二十多年前便研究中國音樂，以前曾作有「北京胡同」等交饗曲，先後在北平，上海，紐約等地演奏，極博好評。現在要演出的「五行星」便是在克服了種種困難之後，方始問世的一個短舞劇。</p>
<p>「五行星」取材於一張發掘自教煌地室事的佛像，（這張佛像為五世紀之物，現藏倫敦博物館），除了中坐的彌勒佛之外，週團站着金，木，水，火，土五行星宿。故事便根據這張書，而加以想像的發展：在淸農，這些星宿，雖然自　上，但也和人間一樣，作了種種遊戲，然後又各自歸還原位。這簡單得簡直不能稱為故事的，然而它卸包含了很多美　的舞姿和幽揚的音樂。</p>
<p>不完全襲用皮黃曲調，而根據中國民謠製曲的新歌劇，用部分的對白，歌唱，舞蹈而綜合成的音樂劇，這將都是中國舞劇試騐成功之後所要嘗試和建立的戲劇藝術。</p>
<p>中國舞蹈還沒有被發掘和發揚，也和音樂一樣，經過一番復興和發展之後，將是世界藝壇的一個最奇矞豐美的寳座。關於這點，就是在今天，也被許多瞭解中國藝術的外人所公認。</p>
<p>除了五行星獨幕舞劇之外，還有幾隻個別的小舞蹈：「馬射」，「游　」，「　　」，「打漁」和「出征」等。</p>
<p>這些一節都由名坤伶馬麗雲，業餘劇人陳鐘等演出。馬　雲是我們比較熟悉的名字。　「去冬還在黃金演戲，二三年前她並曾和周價芳們一同演過話劇「雷雨」，是一個有志於改良平劇的平劇演員」。陳鍾去年在「古剎驚夢」裏演敏勇，成續很好，還有「印度舞」，中著名印度舞專家英蒂拉戴薇女士主演。</p>
<p>中國舞劇和印度舞自昨日起至明日止，每日下午五時一刻起，在蘭心大戲院公演。</p>
<h3>「春水情波」的我見</h3>
<p>— 鄭鑌凌</p>
<p>「春水情波」是金星的出品，內容叙述一個出洋留學生唐樹生回國後，愛上了其家抵債的女婢阿毛，並於某夜，情不自禁，發生了關係。迨後樹生北上做官，阿毛母女因身份不同不克同行，樹生旣晋身官階，縱情聲色，先與交際花寒瓊相燕好，繼又和表妹胡小瑜結婚，而昔日之阿毛，早置諸腦後。阿毛自春風一度，耶產一兒，因格於環境，不克容身，遂避入一育嬰堂，該堂主持者正創辦墾荒團，阿毛毅然加入相與遠行，路過樹生住處，相見之下，竟為樹生所否認。未幾，樹生與寒瓊之事為其妻所悉，於是兩鵰相繼與之脫離，無何，樹生追踪至墾荒團，冀與阿毛重圓其夢，但為阿毛所拒絕。</p>
<p>導演黃漢，為其初出茅廬之作，然手法老練，與組織之有條不紊，並不遜於前輩，唯一缺點，就是緊張塲面不够緊張。演技方面，徐風之樹生，胡楓之阿毛，王耶絮之唐父，秦煒之劉子和，歐陽莎菲之寒瓊，皆頗適合其個性，故演出自然，其他演員，亦演得不差。縣影方面，有幾個鏡頭頗為新穎，例如唐父之望其子成為大官及與表妹結婚，均由照片中表示出來，較之言語形容，可謂勝過多矣。大體看來，該片仍不失為一成功作品，可惜膠片太短，演時僅一點一刻，觀衆們也許不够過癮吧。</p>

<p>費長河和他的羽黨，面有得色而去了，秦潤之也忽然想着了什麼，急急忙追進出去。阿興和何媽等，還在屋簷下竊竊私語，維城對他們望了一眼，問道：「何子興呢？」阿興道：「他接二太太去了。」維城道：「誰敎接去的讓二太太在張家多住一天不好嗎？」阿興低了頭沒有話說，維城又問了一聲是誰的主意，葉二太太從外面進來，一路進來，一路在問：「人在那裏，人在那裹？」這差不多是給阿興解了圍。維城從　裏邊迎出來。見葉二太太把絨繩短大衣擺在手上，頭髮給河風吹得蓬蓬鬈鬈的，斷定她今天還沒上過刨花水：何子興在後邊跟進來，手裏抱了一大捆紅皮甘蔗。維城忙喚道：一嬸娘，你怎麽就回來了？」葉二太太道：一聽說費長河帶了狐羣狗黨來我們家裏訛詐財，還有個秦潤之在做笑面虎。人呢？　維城笑道：「沒有像嬸娘說的嚴重，一定是何子興輕事重報。嬸娘，他們走了。」葉二太太看喜鵲拿了箕帚，在雙梅書屋裏打掃，她就走進雙梅書屋去。維城道：「他們眞是走了。一一姨的身體怎樣，完全好了嗎？很好的，靜心在那邊住幾天，偏是給何子興去請了你回來。葉二太太道：「他們走了，他們得不着便宜不肯走的，你給了多少錢？」維城道：「沒有多少錢，嬸娘知道，怕會心痛。」葉二太太道：「你說。這桌子上是什麼，像賣田契樣的？」維城道：「這便是費長河立的契約，以後他不再來借錢。」葉二太太看出是三百塊錢，便咂　嘴，抱怨維城沒處世經騐，這個錢花的沒意思。維城紅了臉想想，倒也有些對不起尊長，自己手頭闊一闊倒又累嬸娘不快活。（一〇一）（本節完）</p>

<h3>The Port of Sevastopol: German and Soviet Forces Engage in Bloody Battle; Nine-Mile Narrow Front Witnesses Successive Attacks and Heavy Casualties; Large-Scale Air Battles Over the Black Sea and Arctic Ocean</h3>
<p>Swiss Capital, 12th, Allied Press Dispatch: The Soviet front line's battle reached its peak this year last night. In the land wars of the two major battlefields of Crimea and Ukraine, German and Soviet forces are still locked in bloody combat in the Sevastopol area. Sevastopol is the last stronghold of the Soviet army in Crimea and the direction of Kharkov. Reports reaching here indicate that in addition to land warfare, there have been large-scale air battles on the flanks of the Black Sea and the Arctic Ocean. The reports also stated that the German army has successively repelled the Soviet army's counter-offensives in Sevastopol and Kharkov.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 11th, Allied Press Dispatch: Sources here say that on the night of the 10th, the German army on the Kharkov front launched a fierce attack on the Ukrainian corps under the command of Timoshenko. Led by General Hoth, the German army is carrying out a large-scale encirclement and annihilation operation against the Soviet army. After the success of the previous battle, they immediately prepared for a new offensive, launching a sudden and fierce attack on the Soviet army's positions on the night of the 10th. Fierce fighting broke out on the entire Kharkov front. The Soviet Information Bureau had already acknowledged this on the night of the 10th and briefly announced the fact that the German army had launched a fierce attack on the Kharkov front on the night of the 10th.</p>
<p>German Headquarters, 12th, Havas: This afternoon's German military report stated that in the fierce battles in many places within the Soviet fortress of Sevastopol, the German army continued to make progress. The Soviet army's repeated counter-offensives were all crushed, resulting in heavy losses. German bomber groups continued to bomb the Soviet army's deep trenches and high ramparts. German forces were active elsewhere. Our forces east of Kharkov are fighting particularly hard.</p>
<p>Swedish Capital, 12th, Havas: In the battle between German and Soviet forces for Sevastopol, reinforcements are constantly arriving, advancing in waves. The German army attacks strongholds, while the Red Army tenaciously defends them. The battle is rapidly reaching its climax. Soviet reports say that the German army has suffered heavy casualties, while the German side says that these casualties can be replenished. The troops concentrated in front of Sevastopol are fully manned and sufficient to complete the attack mission, especially since the German army has gained air supremacy. However, the Red Army is not showing weakness and is constantly launching powerful counter-offensives. However, these counter-offensives can only delay the time and consume the German side's strength, given that they are outnumbered. The Sevastopol front line is only nine miles long. The amount of heavy artillery concentrated by both sides in this narrow combat zone is astonishing, and the caliber of the artillery is unprecedented since the beginning of the war. German battlefield reporters all admit that the German army is facing unprecedented difficulties in its attack. It is expected that it will take a considerable amount of time before it can be captured.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th, Havas: According to German authoritative authorities last night, the German army is continuing its fierce attack on the Soviet army's strong fortresses in Sevastopol. The Soviet army is still resisting desperately. On Wednesday, German stormtroopers repelled another Soviet counter-offensive, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. The German army is constantly bombarding the enemy's positions with artillery fire, so the fighting there is exceptionally fierce. The German air force is providing extremely effective support, and enemy military targets are constantly being bombed. On Wednesday, one enemy ship was sunk. The German army has also achieved victories in other positions on the Eastern Front. The enemy has built its artillery emplacements in forests and swampy areas. Berlin revealed on Wednesday that in the past three days, the German army destroyed 483 enemy fortresses on the northern route. On Wednesday, another 107 were destroyed, which shows the fullness of the German army's combat power. In the Volkhov area, the Soviet army attempted to seize German outposts, but all failed. Twenty-four Soviet tanks were destroyed in two days.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Ukrainian Border, 11th, Havas: The port of Yana, in the Taman Peninsula occupied by the German army, is a vital location on the Black Sea coast, located about 25 miles northwest of Novorossiysk. The remains of an 18th-century Turkish fortress are still there. The port has a population of about 15,000. After the German army controlled the port, the Red Army in the North Caucasus and Transcaucasus is in danger of being isolated. Moreover, the garrison on the Taman Peninsula has only two routes to communicate with the mainland. After the fall of the port, the southern route has been blocked. The Red Army concentrated on the peninsula can only follow the northern route along the Sea of Azov, which has a serious impact.</p>
<h3>British Acknowledge in Cairo: Bir Hakeim Has Fallen; Germany and Italy Announce the Capture of 2,000 Men; New Battle in North Africa Is About to Begin</h3>
<p>Rome, 12th, Havas: Today's Italian military report stated that the defenses of Bir Hakeim were strong. They have now been broken by German and Italian mechanized units and occupied yesterday morning. The air force's assistance was greatly meritorious. More than 2,000 enemy troops were captured, and a large number of spoils of war and vehicles were seized. Armored patrol vehicles of the British army north of Bir Hakeim attempted to advance, but were severely damaged and repelled by us. The enemy's rear positions were also attacked by the air force. Many armored vehicles and supply vehicles were hit and caught fire. In the air battle, German aircraft shot down five enemy aircraft. One of our destroyers in the Mediterranean was hit and sunk by an enemy torpedo. Another hit a mine and sank. Most of the crew members were rescued. The number of casualties in the Taranto air raid has now increased from twenty to forty-one. Many bombs were dropped on the outskirts of Taranto last night, but there was no damage or casualties.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th, Havas: German officials claimed that the German-Italian Allied forces captured 2,000 men when they occupied Bir Hakeim, and seized or destroyed 24 enemy artillery pieces. Hundreds of motorcycles were seized or destroyed, which proves that the British claim that the British army and the Free French forces voluntarily withdrew from Bir Hakeim is not credible.</p>
<p>Cairo, 11th, Havas: The British General Headquarters has just issued a military report stating that the garrison of Bir Hakeim withdrew from the city last night on the orders of General Ritchie. Most of these troops were "Free Frenchmen" under the command of General Koenig, and had resisted for sixteen days.</p>
<p>Swedish Capital, 12th, Havas: A London telegram stated that the British's last report on the situation in Bir Hakeim arrived in London three hours before the place fell. It was said that after the German army's artillery and aircraft fiercely bombed Bir Hakeim, the German armored units attacked the place from three directions. Our losses were heavy, and the situation was critical. The southern positions were attacked from three sides and had no strength to continue resisting. Three hours later, the British Exchange Telegraph Agency discovered that the telegraph communication with Bir Hakeim had been interrupted.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th, Havas: Military circles pointed out that the fall of Bir Hakeim has greatly enhanced the position of the Axis forces. That place is the most important base and transportation point for British defense. General Rommel's capture of that fortress signifies the end of the second phase of the war. The first phase ended with the capture of 10,000 enemy troops. Now a new battle is about to begin, and its impact on the future is also extremely far-reaching.</p>
<p>Swedish Capital, 12th, Havas: General Koenig, commander of the Bir Hakeim Free French forces, was only a lieutenant when he participated in the Norwegian campaign two years ago. Although he has a German surname, he is actually French. His ancestors were Alsatians who moved to France after 1871. Regarding the importance of Bir Hakeim, the British Daily Express wrote an article on the eve of the city's fall. It was said that if the Axis forces could occupy Bir Hakeim, it would create a new situation for the German army's attack on Tobruk. General Rommel's transportation problems could also be greatly facilitated.</p>
<h3>Results of Air Battles in New Guinea</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th, Allied Press Dispatch: According to a telegram from a certain base, the Japanese Navy has been quite active in the New Guinea area under the equator in recent days, and has fiercely bombed various key enemy locations such as Port Moresby, threatening the isolated Pacific island of Australia. From the 16th of last month to the 9th of this month, the Japanese Navy shot down a total of 68 enemy aircraft and destroyed 4, totaling 72. The Japanese Navy lost a total of 6 aircraft. The details are as follows: On the 16th of last month, two enemy aircraft attacked Lae, and were shot down. On the 18th, when attacking Port Moresby, 4 enemy fighters were shot down, and 4 were destroyed. The Japanese Navy lost 1 aircraft. When attacking the same place on the 20th, another 2 enemy P-39s were shot down. On the 21st and 22nd, 1 enemy B-16 was shot down when attacking Lae, and 6 enemy B-25s were shot down when attacking Lae. The Japanese Navy lost 1 aircraft. On the 26th, during an air battle over Salamaua, 5 enemy aircraft were shot down. On the 27th, when attacking Port Moresby, 4 enemy Spitfires and 6 P-39s were shot down. On the 28th, when attacking the same place, another 1 Spitfire and 12 P-39s were shot down. On the same day, 1 enemy P-26 was shot down when attacking Lae. On the 29th, when attacking Port Moresby, 5 enemy P-39s were shot down. The Japanese Navy lost 1 aircraft. On the 1st of this month, when raiding Port Moresby, 11 enemy P-39s were shot down. The Japanese Navy lost 1 aircraft. On the 2nd, when raiding the same place again, 3 enemy P-39s were shot down. On the 9th, 4 enemy B-26s were shot down when attacking Lae and Salamaua. The Japanese Navy lost 2 aircraft.</p>
<h3>Another American Merchant Ship Sunk</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 11th, Allied Press Dispatch: According to a Washington telegram, the US Navy Department has just announced that an American merchant ship was attacked by an Axis torpedo on the US Atlantic coast.</p>
<p>Washington, 11th, Havas: The Navy Department issued a communiqué today stating that an American cargo ship was sunk by a submarine with artillery shells in the Atlantic Ocean. Many rescued sailors have landed at a certain port in the east.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 12th, Havas: The latest issue of the American magazine Time commented on the loss of American ships, saying that the protection of American coastal shipping is very unlikely, because the US Navy is more urgently needed elsewhere. The United States is currently using small airships as the only weapon to defend against submarines. There are currently three small airship stations on the American coast, and several more are under construction. However, this weapon is difficult to use on a large scale, because the construction of airship stations takes a long time. Therefore, the only way to overcome the difficulties of shipping is to switch to air transport. However, to transport 20 million tons of cargo, 40,000 aircraft are needed, and it will take three years to reach this number.</p>
<h3>Japanese Recruits Will Learn Chinese and Malay</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th, Havas: It was announced here today that all Japanese people who enlist in the autumn will be taught Chinese or Malay before being assigned to the army. These foreign language classes will begin at the end of this month after the physical examination.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 12th, Allied Press Dispatch: According to a Saigon telegram from the Nichinichi Shimbun, the Duke of Gloucester, the brother of the British King, suddenly flew to Karachi on the 11th. A few days ago, he also toured Cairo, Cyprus, Sares, Iran, and other places. After inspecting the British and Indian troops there, he suddenly flew to India to visit various parts of India as the King's representative. The surface reason is to discuss military issues with Indian military leaders, but according to general observations, it is believed that this move is to hold talks with representatives of various factions in India. Following Cripps, this is a means of appeasement towards India. At 8:30 AM on the 12th, the Duke of Gloucester broadcast the King's statement to the Indian people in New Delhi. From this, it can be seen how distressed Britain feels about the anti-British movement in India.</p>

<h3>Soviet, British, and American Agreement: The Goal Is in Europe; The Soviet Union Maintains Neutrality Towards the East</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th, Allied Press Dispatch: Regarding Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's visit to Roosevelt in the United States, although the United States has not made any formal announcements, according to foreign dispatches, the content of the Molotov-Roosevelt talks will mainly focus on two issues: the transportation of aid to the Soviet Union and the creation of a second front in Europe. The East Asian issue will not be of particular importance. The Soviet Union will continue to maintain its neutral attitude in accordance with the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Treaty. Also, the main points of the talks will be to review how to actually implement both aid to the Soviet Union and the European second front in light of all circumstances. However, the desire for the rapid development of these two matters is not smooth at the moment. Therefore, the holding of the British-American-Soviet talks will have, at most, a propaganda effect. It is doubtful whether it will have any major impact on international politics.</p>

At the same time, the two countries reached a complete understanding, agreeing to open a second front in 1942. The White House immediately announced the agreement after its establishment yesterday. The agreement was signed by Secretary of State Hull and Litvinov. Its content is the same as that signed by the United Kingdom and the United States, and it stipulates cooperation in post-war economic relations. This move by the United States clearly aims to divert the attention of the people after the attacks suffered in Dutch Harbor and Midway Island in the Aleutian Islands. The agreement was facilitated by Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov. According to the White House press release, those who participated in the talks included Litvinov, Lend-Lease Administrator Hopkins, Admiral King, Commander-in-Chief of the United States Navy, and Secretary of State Hull. The press release also stated that during the talks, a complete understanding was reached on the urgent and important task of opening a second front in 1942.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 11th (Allied Press) - According to a report from Washington, the White House announced to the press that the United States and the Soviet Union have reached an understanding on joint operations.

Various measures, such as increasing and promoting U.S. aid to the Soviet Union in the form of aircraft, tanks, and other military supplies, were also discussed. Basic issues of U.S.-Soviet cooperation aimed at guaranteeing post-war peace and security were also discussed, and the opinions of both sides converged.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Washington, the U.S. State Department announced today that the U.S. and the Soviet Union have concluded a new economic agreement in addition to the U.S.-Soviet agreement. The economic agreement is aimed at providing material aid to the Soviet Union. Its contents are as follows: 1. The United States will supply the Soviet Union with food and materials in accordance with the Lend-Lease Act, but the payment deadline will be negotiated separately. 2. The agreement stipulates the principles of establishing economic institutions for peace and after the war. 3. The agreement includes post-war issues such as production and the exchange of materials. 4. The agreement abolishes discriminatory treatment in trade and commerce between the two countries. 5. The agreement abolishes protective tariffs and other obstacles to commerce. 6. The agreement achieves the economic goals stated in the Atlantic Charter. The United States believes that this economic agreement can be called the "economic charter" of the U.S.-Soviet "alliance" during wartime and after the war. The Anglo-Soviet treaty and the U.S.-Soviet agreement are evidence of the common cooperation between the UK, the US, and the Soviet Union on European issues.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Reuters) - According to reports from New York, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov traveled to the United States from London on a Soviet four-engine bomber and arrived in Washington on May 29.

An understanding has also been reached on the issue of opening a second front in Europe this year, and the increase in the shipment of war materials to the Soviet Union has also been discussed.</p>
<h3>No Agreement Reached on Soviet Union's Post-War Borders</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 12th (Reuters) - Today, Swedish newspapers reported that London's comments on the Anglo-Soviet treaty pointed out that the issue of the Soviet Union's post-war borders had not been agreed upon. "Nyheter" wrote that during the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, it was originally intended to write these borders into the treaty, but one party refused, so this did not become a reality. People in London believed that this move would please the United States, Poland, and Turkey. "Dagens Bladet" carried a telegram from a London correspondent, saying that London political figures were very surprised by the intention of the Anglo-Saxon countries to establish a second front in Europe this year. The general public's fear was that this move would have a significant moral impact on the UK, the US, and the Soviet Union. The correspondent continued, saying that the announcement of this plan by the Anglo-Saxon countries proved that the UK's current air offensive against Germany could not be regarded as an action to establish a second front, and that British and American troops had to land on the European continent. "Svenska Dagbladet" wrote that the Anglo-Soviet treaty was written in both English and Russian and was attached with dark blue silk emperors. Both were attached with the red seals of the foreign ministers of the two countries. When Molotov was in London, he met with all the members of the British cabinet and went to the bombed areas of London to inspect the damage. The head of the Soviet delegation to the Army and Navy also went to Washington with Molotov. It is said that Molotov conducted very detailed discussions on military issues during his negotiations in London and Washington, basing his negotiations on the Anglo-American strategic agreement signed during U.S. Chief of Staff Marshall's visit to London.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 12th (Reuters) - This morning, Swedish newspapers revealed detailed contents of the Anglo-Soviet military and economic agreement, including those that have not yet been revealed to the world. The report cited London dispatches pointing out that the new Anglo-Soviet treaty did not mention anything about the Soviet Union's future borders in Europe. However, before the signing of the treaty, the two sides had negotiated for five months, and it was not impossible that they had discussed in detail and even decided on the Soviet Union's post-war borders. Commentators said that Article 5 of the treaty, which recognized the need to guarantee each other's security, implied acceptance of the Soviet Union's request for a militarily advantageous western border. When Eden reported to Moscow, Stalin expressed his personal views on post-war borders, which was the beginning of the negotiations. After listening, Eden declared to Stalin that he was willing to convey everything he had heard to the British wartime cabinet. During the talks, Stalin emphasized the need to restore the western border of the Soviet Union as of June 22, 1941, such as the eastern part of Poland, Bukovina, Bessarabia, and the territories ceded to the Soviet Union by Finland. At the same time, Stalin assured Eden that he fully understood Britain's interests in the Mediterranean and Africa, and Britain's need to obtain naval bases on the western coast of France. He also emphasized that the Soviet Union needed to obtain freedom of access to the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea. Finally, Stalin demanded a solution to the Yugoslavian border issue. After Eden returned to London, negotiations continued, with Soviet Ambassador to the UK Maisky participating in the discussions, and progress was smoother. On March 12, Churchill sent a letter to Stalin, in addition to expressing admiration for the Red Army's achievements in Eastern Europe, stating his desire for the UK and the Soviet Union to conclude an alliance, but the contents of this treaty must be notified to the US government and must not contain secret clauses. At this time, the United States had revealed its unwillingness to participate in the Anglo-Soviet alliance. Roosevelt believed that it was unwise to subordinate the eastern part of Poland to the Soviet Union. On the 16th of the same month, Maisky presented Stalin's reply to Churchill in front of Eden. Stalin agreed to inform the US government of the progress of the negotiations at any time and agreed to publish it if an agreement was signed. At the same time, he expressed his belief that Germany would be defeated this year. Eden repeatedly invited Molotov to come to the UK to discuss major issues. Molotov initially declined, but finally accepted the invitation and went to the UK. At that time, Roosevelt invited Stalin to Washington to discuss important matters. For various reasons, Stalin could not agree. Molotov then decided to visit the UK first and then go to Washington, first to discuss the overall operational plan and second to revise the contract for the delivery of munitions, because the contract signed when Lord Beaverbrook and Harriman reported to Moscow would expire on July 1. At this time, the Polish government-in-exile, having learned of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, was greatly alarmed, and General Sikorski personally went to Washington to take advantage of the situation. Now let us briefly describe Molotov's visit to the UK and its gains. On May 20, Molotov arrived at the Scottish airfield. Ten officials accompanied him to the UK. Eden personally went to the airfield to welcome him. The negotiations began on May 22 and ended on the 25th. In addition to the important personnel accompanying Molotov, Ambassador Maisky and the Soviet military and naval attachés to the UK also attended the discussions. From this, one can see the special importance of military issues. After several meetings, the new Anglo-Soviet treaty was signed on the evening of May 26 in the office of the Foreign Secretary. Prime Minister Churchill and Sir Sinclair were present to celebrate the success of the treaty. Half an hour later, Molotov set off for the United States. Eden met with the Turkish ambassador to the UK and the foreign minister of the Polish government-in-exile before signing the treaty to inform them that the UK and the Soviet Union were about to sign an agreement, and it seemed that he no longer had time to consider the attitudes of other countries.</p>
<p>The issue of disarmament was also not mentioned. Stockholm, 12th (Reuters) - "Nyheter" wrote in today's editorial that the last world war had published a peace plan, but the treaty signed by the UK and the Soviet Union did not mention the reduction of armaments. On the contrary, the UK and the Soviet Union both want to use force to defend the new Europe they want to create. The UK is now vigorously promoting this Anglo-Soviet treaty. Considering the goals of the UK, the US, and the Soviet Union, it is to counter Germany's post-war plan. According to a dispatch from a London correspondent in Swedish newspapers, Molotov stopped in London for two days on his way back to Moscow from Washington, apparently to inform the British government of the results of his negotiations with Roosevelt. It is known that Molotov's visit to Washington resulted in two major achievements: 1. The United States will supply the Soviet Union with unlimited military supplies in accordance with the Lend-Lease Act. 2. The Soviet Union agrees to the U.S. government's international trade policy, meaning that the Soviet Union will no longer insist on self-sufficiency. "Svenska Dagbladet" wrote that regarding the issue of the second front, the people of London still do not know when and where it should be. It is generally expected that it will not become a reality before the fall of this year. The newspaper continued that Churchill and Eden had arranged everything for Molotov's visit to Washington for negotiations.</p>
<p>Difficulties in transporting aid to the Soviet Union. Tokyo, 12th (Allied Press) - According to the White House in the U.S., the UK, the US, and the Soviet Union have reached a consensus on issues such as promoting the transportation of aid to the Soviet Union, opening a second front, and post-war reconstruction. However, according to various opinions, due to the recent shortage of ships on the United Nations side and the obstruction of sea routes, it is feared that the transportation of aid to the Soviet Union will not have any effect. Moreover, because the United States' aid to the Soviet Union in accordance with the Lend-Lease Act is only empty talk, the Soviet Union, under the fierce German offensive, sent Molotov to the United States to urge the country to promote its aid to the Soviet Union. As for the issue of the second front, the Soviet Union is also urging it very urgently. However, the US is short of ships and its combat power is low, so only the UK is bombing southwestern Germany with its air force to muddle along. Regarding the issue of post-war reconstruction, in the past, when Soviet Ambassador to the US Litvinov and Hull negotiated, the United States' post-war countermeasures based on the "Atlantic Charter" were clearly different from the Soviet Union's views, and the conflicting views between the US and the Soviet Union had also become ossified. In this embarrassing situation, the United States encouraged Molotov to visit the United States to exchange views in order to slightly appease the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Former Burmese Prime Minister Ba Saw Still in Prison</h3>
<p>London, June 11th, Reuter - The Minister for Indian and Burmese Affairs, Mr. Amery, stated in the House of Commons today that the former Prime Minister of Burma, Ba Saw, is currently still in prison. The current Burmese Prime Minister and Finance Minister are serving in the interim government of India and Burma.</p>
<h3>4. Palestine, the Religious Holy Land</h3>
<p>What kind of paradise is it exactly?</p>
<p>Palestine is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the west, Syria to the north, Egypt to the southwest, and Transjordan to the east, with the Jordan River as the boundary. It covers an area of approximately nine thousand square miles, with a population of about one million, roughly equivalent to a quarter of Jiangsu Province in China. Its terrain is high on all sides and low in the middle. The lowest point is the Dead Sea. The Dead Sea's water surface is 1,300 feet below sea level, making it the lowest water surface in the world. The Dead Sea's water contains a high amount of salt, making it impossible for fish to live, hence the name Dead Sea. Because it contains many minerals, the specific gravity of the Dead Sea water is 1.2. People can easily float in the Dead Sea, so there is no danger of drowning. Among the minerals in the Dead Sea water, potassium salt is the most abundant. Therefore, since World War I, when the British recruited Jews to return to their homeland in Palestine, the Jews have found ways to extract potassium from the Dead Sea water, with considerable success. Germany has also paid close attention to the potassium salt in the Dead Sea water.</p>
<p>The Dead Sea is narrow and elongated, 46 miles long and an average of 8 miles wide, containing 25% salt. Some estimate that it contains 100 billion tons of potassium carbonate, 85 million tons of bromine, over 100 billion tons of , and over 20 billion tons of magnesium chloride.</p>
<p>In terms of agricultural products, Palestine produces barley, wheat, olives, figs, Arab dates, grapes, oranges, lemons, etc. In terms of mineral products, it has stone materials, gypsum, salt, etc. Coastal fishing is quite prosperous. Animal husbandry is prevalent in the hilly areas, with goats, sheep, and camels being the main livestock.</p>
<p>Regarding transportation in Palestine, there is a railway running vertically. The section connecting Cairo was built by the British for military use during World War I. During World War I, when the British failed to capture the Turkish Straits, they devised a plan to use guerrilla tactics from the Arabian Peninsula to contain the Turkish army on one hand, and on the other hand, General Allenby led the British army from Egypt across the Sinai Peninsula directly to Palestine, shaking the military position of the Turkish Empire, which is the railway they took. As for sea routes, there are the ports of Jaffa and Haifa, which are the centers of overseas navigation.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Palestine consist of Arabs, who account for six-eighths of the population, and Jews, who account for one-eighth. With the help of the British, the number of Jews continues to increase there, which is no wonder that the Arabs are dismayed. Their numbers increased from 58,000 in 1920 to 140,000 in 1931. Out of the 16 million Jews worldwide, one-tenth are already here.</p>
<p>Here is the holy city of Jerusalem—the holy city for Christians and also the holy city for Muslims—now the capital of the mandated territory, located in central Palestine, northwest of the Dead Sea, built on a mountaintop over 2,500 feet above sea level. Here is Bethlehem, the birthplace of Jesus Christ. The people here, divided by religion, include Jews who believe in Judaism, Christians who believe in Christianity, and Syrians who believe in Islam.</p>
<p>Its important ports include Jaffa and Haifa. Jaffa is located northwest of Jerusalem on the coast and has a railway connection to Jerusalem. Many who come to worship at the holy land land here. The nearby area produces many oranges, which are exported from here. Haifa is north of Jaffa, on the coast and also connected by railway, and is also an important commercial port. Since the British began operating the Su Oilfields (in Iraq), they have built over a thousand miles of pipelines directly to Haifa. The oil is transferred from the pipelines to oil tankers in Haifa, which is very convenient, so Haifa is more important.</p>
<p>Palestine can be divided into two zones. The coastal area is a fertile Mediterranean region, producing oranges and other fruits. The hilly zone is where Jerusalem is located, which is quite cold in winter and produces olive trees. The deep valley region is where the Jordan River and the Dead Sea are located, where the weather is quite warm.</p>

<h3>Rationing by Population in the French Concession to Begin on the 20th of this Month; Landlords or Public Residence Managers Who Extort Residents Will Be Severely Punished</h3>
<p>According to a report from a Datong News Agency reporter who inquired at the French Concession's Paocheng System Headquarters on Jinshenfu Road, residents of the French Concession are currently applying for identity cards, but they have not yet been issued. However, the rationing system in the French Concession will be implemented starting on the 20th of this month, regardless of whether the identity cards have been fully issued. Detailed and precise measures have already been drafted and will be announced soon. For residents who are subtenants, their applications must be guaranteed by the head of the household. Residents living in public residences must also be guaranteed by the manager of the public residence (who is also the head of the household). If landlords or public residence managers take this opportunity to increase rents or extort residents, once discovered, the French police will take the same attitude as the Public Concession Paocheng Guidance Department, namely, severely punish them, or even expel them from the concession.</p>
<h3>Major Industries in This City Will Not Accept Old Currency Starting on the 19th of This Month</h3>
<p>According to the Allied News Agency, the Chinese Merchants Bank in this city has already stopped accepting old currency in order to help the National Government withdraw it. In addition, major Japanese companies and military-managed companies have decided to take the same measures starting on the 17th. It has now been decided that major Chinese-owned department stores, hotels, movie theaters, restaurants, and wholesale and retail merchants of silk, rayon, and woolen goods within the concessions will also refuse to accept old currency (subsidiary coins are not included) starting on June 19th, and will switch to transacting entirely in new legal tender. Regarding this matter, the China Liaison Department of the Asian Development Board announced on the 12th that transactions in major stores and companies within the concessions will be entirely converted to one type of new legal tender (except for military scrip transactions). Other small businesses, for their own benefit, will have no choice but to take the same measures. At the same time, regarding the full implementation of new legal tender transactions in the French Concession, the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai is currently urging the French Concession's Municipal Council to realize it. Therefore, transactions in the Shanghai area will become entirely new legal tender. An official from the China Liaison Department of the Asian Development Board stated that major Japanese companies and military-managed companies will stop accepting old currency and switch to new legal tender transactions starting on June 17th to assist the new currency policy. The details have already been announced previously. Now, major Chinese-owned department stores, hotels, movie theaters, restaurants, and wholesale and retail merchants of rayon and cotton-woolen goods within the concessions, after consultation with the local authorities, have also decided to refuse to accept old currency starting on June 19th and to transact entirely in new currency. Therefore, in order to prevent the value of old currency from becoming unstable after the full exchange period, most Chinese merchants are quickly exchanging all old currency for new legal tender, hoping that all transactions will be calculated entirely in new legal tender. In addition, as a result of discussions between various industries and the authorities, the following major Chinese companies and stores will uniformly transact in new legal tender starting on June 19th:</p>
<p>Department Stores: Wing On, Sincere, The Sun, China National Goods, Whiteaway Laidlaw, Welfare, Lihua.</p>
<p>Hotels: Park Hotel, Cathay Hotel. Movie Theaters: Grand Theatre, Hukuang, New China, Paramount, Capitol, Greater Shanghai, Kincheng, Grand Cathay, Nanjing, and twelve others.</p>
<p>Restaurants: Datung Restaurant, Xinhua Restaurant, Guanshengyuan, Hongmian, Park Hotel, Sinya, Dai Erh Sin, Ihon, Ron Wah, King Wah, Dai Wah, Kung Tak Lam Vegetarian Restaurant, Meihua Restaurant, Tung Ah Restaurant, Chin Jiang Sichuan Restaurant, Yueh Bin Lau, Ta San Yuan, Chih Mei Lau, Hsin, San Ho Lou, Cheng Du Sichuan Restaurant, Hui Bin Lou, Xing Hua Lou, Nan Wah Restaurant, and twenty-nine others.</p>
<p>Silk Fabric Merchants: Member stores of the Shanghai Silk Fabric Trade Association, member stores of the Shanghai Cotton Fabric Trade Association, member stores of the China Woolen Textile Production and Sales Association.</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Businesses Stop Accepting Old Currency; No Accommodation for Old Currency for Debt Repayment or Withdrawals; Depositors Must First Exchange for Central Reserve Bank Notes</h3>
<p>The Provisional United Association of Members of the Silver and Money Industry received a letter from the Japanese Finance Officer stating that, except for handling the exchange of old legal tender on behalf of the Central Reserve Bank, all other receipts and payments of old legal tender should be stopped. The association issued a notice to member firms yesterday to comply. It is reported that various banks and money shops have recently decided that, starting today, only Central Reserve Bank notes will be accepted for debt repayment and withdrawals. Old legal tender will absolutely not be accommodated. Those who open accounts with old legal tender converted into Central Reserve Bank notes must first fill out an application to exchange old legal tender for Central Reserve Bank notes and can only deposit Central Reserve Bank notes after exchanging them. However, there are no restrictions on the exchange of old legal tender by various firms. Exchange is available at any time during the firm's business hours (9:00 AM to 3:00 PM).</p>
<h3>Asian Development Board to Investigate Factories in This City Starting Tomorrow to Ensure the Rational Development of Essential Goods Production and Improve Work Efficiency to Achieve Stable Livelihoods</h3>
<p>In order to reorganize various industries in this city and create basic statistics, the Japanese have long planned to investigate the actual conditions of factories in this city, and the relevant Japanese authorities have been preparing step by step. It is reported that a comprehensive survey of factories in Shanghai will begin on June 15th. The China Liaison Department of the Asian Development Board summoned most of the relevant merchants on the 11th to explain the implementation methods and other matters and issued a statement.</p>
<p>Ensuring Rational Development of Production: The statement said that starting on June 15th, the Asian Development Board authorities will investigate factories in Shanghai, which will take about a month. This matter has also received the full assistance of the Public Works Department and the French Municipal Council. The plan includes surveying over 1,300 factories of all nationalities that usually employ 30 or more workers. Since the Pacific War, the operation of various factories has been very difficult. The main goal of this survey is to obtain the necessary information on production conditions and labor conditions in order to achieve stable livelihoods, ensure the production of essential goods, and rationally develop the Shanghai economy. Some factories that are currently closed or suspended may be necessary for stabilizing livelihoods in the future and may be reopened.</p>
<p>Investigative Work Carried Out in Groups: In this way, the Japanese may be able to increase the supply of raw materials and make the factory's production equipment more rationalized in order to improve work efficiency. In addition, the factory owners or managers of the factories to be investigated should assist the authorities in conducting the investigation and should not have any misunderstandings. As for the investigative work, several investigation teams will be formed according to the type of factory. Each team will consist of four people: one official from the Asian Development Board, one engineer, one patrolman, and one interpreter. All investigators will be equipped with an Asian Development Board investigation certificate and armband. If suspicious persons are encountered, the Asian Development Board must be notified immediately. Factory owners and managers should also pay attention not to reduce their normal work standards during the investigation.</p>

<h3>News from the Chinese Religious Moral Society: Hosting Tea Cart Distribution of Medicine and Medical Consultations</h3>
<p>The Chinese Religious Moral Society on Tongfu Road in this city has always been committed to various charitable activities. Recently, in view of the increasing heat and the general plight of coolies and rickshaw pullers who are inevitably thirsty and annoyed under the scorching sun all day long, the society has actively produced several tea carts for the convenience of the poor to drink at any time, which will soon be running in the concession areas. They will also carry refreshing medicine and pestilence-preventing pills to distribute to the poor and sick. In addition, the free medical consultation and medicine distribution department has hired several famous Chinese and Western doctors to hold large-scale free medical consultations and medicine distribution at the main and branch locations of the society starting from the first day of the fifth lunar month, from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM every day. No registration fee is required. At a time when prices are high and the poor are struggling, the society's enthusiasm is truly a blessing for the people in need. It is also reported that the society is still handling return-to-hometown travel permits. Citizens who wish to return to their hometown can apply every afternoon.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Electric Power Company Changes Power Distribution Policy to Fully Supply Production and Severely Restrict Consumption; Power Supply Will Be Stopped After Two Instances of Overconsumption</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Electric Power Company is one of the public utilities in this city. The electricity it supplies is the driving force behind Shanghai's production activities, so the method of its power distribution is particularly important. At the end of last year, due to the lack of coal, the company restricted and reduced the supply of electricity to all production and consumption needs.</p>
<p>Restriction Method</p>
<p>The initial restriction method was based on the consumption in the previous year, and the power distribution rates were as follows: Transportation and public utilities 70%, buildings and residences 60%, industry 45%, luxury goods 45%, entertainment 45%. Later, after the Japanese army moved into the concessions, the company was also under their management, but they did not change this distribution method.</p>
<p>Distribution Policy</p>
<p>Until recently, when the Japanese entrusted the China Hydroelectric Company to operate the Shanghai Electric Power Company, they re-established the distribution restriction method, with the new policy of fully supplying production electricity needs and severely restricting non-production electricity needs. The distribution rates have also changed as follows: Special industries 100%, transportation and public utilities 100%, buildings and residences 45%, ordinary industries (excluding food industries) 45%, luxury goods 40%, entertainment 45%.</p>
<p>Penalties for Overconsumption</p>
<p>As for ordinary households, the consumption limit is five KW per household per month. Those who exceed this amount must pay an excess fine in accordance with the regulations. In the past, the company only needed to fine these users slightly and continued to supply electricity. However, after the company was entrusted to operate, it has stipulated more severe measures, that is, if a user overconsumes electricity for the first time, in addition to the fine, the power distribution for the following month will be reduced. If there are two instances of overconsumption, the power supply will be terminated.</p>

<h3>Conte Verde Cruise Ship Postpones Carrying Overseas Chinese from Shanghai; Departure Set for the 23rd of This Month; 650 People to Evacuate by Ship</h3>
<p>A reporter recently learned from authoritative sources that the Italian large passenger ship Conte Verde, which was assigned to carry American evacuees from China to Portuguese East Africa, will be delayed by one week and is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 23rd or 24th of this month. 650 people will leave on this ship, but not all will depart from Shanghai. The ship will stop at other ports on its way to Africa to pick up evacuating diplomats and overseas Chinese on assigned duties from those locations and sail to their destination together. It is reported that the ship can accommodate 1,000 passengers, and it is currently only carrying 650 passengers, so there is plenty of space. Therefore, authoritative sources believe that the number of evacuees may increase until the ship is full. According to officials in charge of coordinating the evacuation of overseas Chinese, only a very small number of ordinary American overseas Chinese in this city will be on the evacuation list. The complete list will be finalized and announced one or two days before departure. It is reported that officials from Canada and South American countries will also be on the Conte Verde. It is also learned that a group of Allied officials and civilians from the Nanjing area, including 52 American diplomats and missionaries, arrived in Shanghai by train from Nanjing the day before yesterday. Among the American evacuees, 31 are from Nanjing, from Huaiyin, 2 from Zhenjiang, 1 from Changzhou, and 10 from other places along the Beijing-Shanghai line.</p>
<p>Evacuation List Continuously Revised: Although it has been declared by the relevant authorities that diplomatic and consular officials from the United States, Canada, and South American countries stationed in China will leave Shanghai for Portuguese East Africa in the middle of this month to exchange for Japanese officials gathered there, the actual situation is that the Japanese authorities and the Swiss Consulate General in Shanghai refuse to announce it. It is said that the list of evacuees that has been compiled, as corroborated by Swiss Vice Consul Dr. Schilling, will be continuously revised until the last minute before departure. Because those who are decided to be allowed to evacuate at the moment may not evacuate at that time. Announcing the list now will cause all kinds of unease and disappointment.</p>
<p>Some Details Awaiting Negotiation: However, the general public of foreigners believes that the number of Allied officials who may be evacuated in the middle of this month will not exceed 650, because most of them are ordinary people from various ports in North and South China. In recent days, people from Ping, Tianjin, Qingdao, Jinan, Zhifu, Nanjing, and other places have been arriving in Shanghai to gather and wait for evacuation. Some Americans living in Shanghai have prepared their luggage in case of evacuation, but most people doubt whether they also have the possibility of evacuation. Judging from the overall development of the case, there are definitely some final details regarding the exchange of officials and civilians that remain unresolved, so the haze has not yet cleared.</p>
<p>Conte Verde Trials in Japan: As for the Italian postal ship Conte Verde, which is scheduled to leave Shanghai for the Philippines in the middle of the month, after it suddenly sailed to Japan on Sunday night, there has been much speculation. However, the more reliable and consistent opinion is that the ship seems to have been leased by the Japanese naval authorities. This trip to Japan is to inspect the hull and machinery. When it returns to Shanghai, it may bring back Allied officials left in Japan. After the American, Canadian, and other officials and civilians in Shanghai board the ship, they will be carried to East Africa together, as the ship has many cabins and is enough to accommodate them. As for the evacuation of British officials, the Swiss Vice Consul said that it will be considered when the Japanese postal ships Tatsuta Maru or Kamakura Maru may sail from Shanghai to East Africa next month.</p>
<h3>Six Bandits Arrested</h3>

Subsequently, in the French Concession and Nanshi, they successively arrested five accomplices, Lu Hongbin, Lu Juzi, (alias Lu Zhenguo), Yang Xuedan, Yang Xuegui, and Wu Wenzhun, all from Jiangbei. A lotus seedpod-type pistol and six bullets were also confiscated from Yang Xuegui. They were all taken to the police station and detained for investigation.</p>
<h3>Former Public Works Department Guarantee Deposits Calculated in Central Reserve Bank Notes</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department recently issued an announcement stating that the old legal tender guarantee deposits previously collected by the department will be converted into Central Reserve Bank notes starting on June 1st at a ratio of two to one.</p>
<h3>Deaf and Dumb Saved</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fudya School sent a letter saying that after this newspaper published the article "Save Deaf and Dumb Orphans," it received sympathy and support from enthusiastic people in the community. It has now received 1,000 yuan from Pan Wuben Church, 50 yuan from Lu Feizhang, 20 yuan from an anonymous letter, 40 yuan from an anonymous person in person, and 100 yuan from Yu Ji, totaling 1,210 old legal tender. Thank you for that. Rice teachers and mothers have already managed to provide clothes and bedding and first sent Yi Yunyin (12 years old) and Li Mingsheng (8 years old) to the school to study. The two students are like fish in water, very happy, innocent, lively, and have good qualifications, and will definitely achieve something in the future. The other four students, seeing that these two students have been able to enter the school, are envious and show reluctance, which is very pitiful. It is hoped that enthusiastic people in the community will generously donate to help these orphans achieve their goals. As you rebuild their lives. If you wish to donate, please notify the Shanghai Fudya School at No. 23 Huangjiasha Flower Garden Road, Cade Road, telephone 32946, and we will send someone to collect it immediately.</p>

<h3>Mingxin Establishes Summer Bookkeeping Class</h3>
<p>The Mingxin Commercial Accounting School at No. 18, Alley 531, Henan Road in this city believes that businesses in Shanghai (especially sole proprietorships) do not pay much attention to accounting, so the accounts are not complete. However, since the Public Works Department opened the retail tax on June 1st, businesses have had to make accurate records of the accounts in order to ensure fair taxation. In order to meet the needs of various industries, the school has established a bookkeeping and accounting class during the summer vacation to quickly train accounting personnel. Classes are scheduled to start at the end of June. Industries that need to improve their accounting can send staff to join the school's morning and evening classes for study.</p>

<h3>Japanese Military Authorities Establish Enemy Property Management Committee to Handle the Assets and Enterprises of Enemy Countries and Nationals</h3>
<p>According to the Allied News Agency, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Army and Navy authorities have taken various measures to handle all assets and enterprises of enemy countries and nationals. It is learned that the Japanese military authorities have established an Enemy Property Management Committee, which has already started working. The address is Branch 2 of the Asian Development Board at 2 Jiangwan Road. It is scheduled to move to the Naval Attaché Office at 27 Bund recently. The Japanese Fleet Reporting Department in China and the Shanghai Military Reporting Department jointly announced on the 11th that since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Army and Navy have taken measures to seize materials, liquidate financial institutions, and take over factories for enemy countries and nationals' assets. This time, in order to properly handle all movable and immovable properties and enterprises of enemies in Central China (excluding the Wuhan area) and contribute to the construction of the Central China economy and the establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Enemy Property Management Committee has been established, and preparations have been completed and work has begun. According to past facts, it is very clear that the examination and handling of enemy property has always been done fairly and properly. Those who have objections or wish to apply regarding the examination or handling should submit an application with supporting documents to the Enemy Property Management Committee through the nearby Kempeitai if the property is located in an army-guarded area, or through the Naval Attaché Office if it is in a navy-guarded area (for navy-guarded areas outside Shanghai, it should be submitted through the local navy garrison unit).</p>
<h3>Eagle Claw Hand, Nocturnal Eyes, Lion Face, Split Skin... A True Account of Leprosy Patients' Lives</h3>
<p>— Jia Liang</p>
<p>Exerting Their Utmost to Survive, Courage Still Helps Themselves and Others, Friendly Spirit Abounds</p>
<p>In such a complex and bustling metropolis, full of stimulation and excitement, the movements of men and women, old and young, merge into a constant torrent of people. Who would think that in another corner of the same place, there is a group of people living a life isolated from the world because of their physical defects? They are not refugees displaced by war, nor are they beggars scorned and despised by society, but leprosy patients suffering from a contagious and deadly disease, who have no choice but to isolate themselves from the outside world.</p>
<p>They are housed in the Chinese Leprosy Hospital on Route Ghisi in western Shanghai. There are a total of one hundred and eight people, including young men of thirteen or fourteen years old whose childishness hasn't faded away, and old men of seventy who have lived a long life; there are so-called modern girls who have been baptized by the glamour of the metropolis, and there are also crude, seemingly semi-civilized old women from the countryside; there are pastors who always have the Bible in their hands and repent with every word about God, there are painters, there are writers, and there are also mentally challenged people who are illiterate. They come from different backgrounds, have different beliefs, different interests, and all kinds of differences. However, they suffer from the same disease, are isolated in the same hospital, receive the same treatment, and live the same life.</p>
<p>Although the hospital is not a tall building, but only a few thatched huts, it is small but complete. The houses in the front of the courtyard serve as passageways, pharmacies, weaving rooms, offices and libraries, etc. The courtyard is a large patio, with male and female patients on both sides. There are a total of seventy-three male patients, who are divided into two rooms according to the severity of their condition. Those suffering from lung disease are isolated separately for fear of infection. There are twenty-nine female patients, who live in a separate room. In the center of the patio is a chapel, with a large red cross hanging under the eaves. The chapel can accommodate hundreds of people, and a mirror frame is hung on the wall, on which is written "Christ is the Lord of this Hospital." To the left front of the patio are the clinic, laundry, and kitchen. Behind the chapel is an open space, which is used as a place for planting and animal husbandry.</p>
<p>The daily life of these "one hundred and eight heroes," although not strictly regulated by the hospital authorities, is worth mentioning for its automatic discipline. Except for those who are seriously ill and have to lie in bed and be served by others, the rest can at least take care of everything themselves. Laundry, spinning, carpentry, raising pigeons, raising pigs, watching over, tidying up, sweeping, etc., are all handled by leprosy patients with division of labor. Those with higher intelligence and skills also volunteer to be honorary teachers to help the general illiterate people in the hospital; some are good at writing and jointly run a magazine called "Morning Light Quarterly" with several comrades, which is the mouthpiece of the leprosy hospital; some advocate "labor service" and pave the flat road in the hospital with stone slabs; some individually knit textiles, which are disinfected by the hospital and sold to the outside world to make a living. They never reduce their courage to survive because of their physical disabilities. They also try to use the skills and intelligence that have not been stripped away by leprosy to help themselves and each other, full of friendly spirit, and build their own world.</p>
<p>In the early morning, a group of leprosy patients gather in the chapel to worship and read the scriptures. They do not forget to pursue spiritual strength and comfort to eliminate physical deficiencies and pain. They are also very particular about their food and lodging. Single spring bed, white sheets, thick mattresses. They eat three meals a day, early porridge with bran or red beans, lunch with one soup and two dishes, all using a separate meal system.

<h3>Rumors of Suspension of Business Rampant in the Market, Cotton Cloth Price Drop Suddenly Arises</h3>

<h3>Demand Exceeds Supply, Boiled Raw Silk Falls and Then Rises Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the underground market for cash boiled raw silk first fell sharply, and then suddenly rebounded in the afternoon, once retreating to the 24,000 yuan level. Initially, the news of control coming from the cotton yarn market caused infighting among many parties, but the Tianjin gang continued to be allowed to cover their shorts. Ultimately, due to the relationship between chips, it was announced to rise. According to the indefinite state of mind of various parties, from the farmer, each bar (10 taels) opened at 24,800 yuan, 400 yuan lower. A certain securities firm and a certain gang competed to enter, and those who sold less immediately saw a rise of 1,000 yuan, making a high of 15,800 yuan. Many parties in the financial community came out, and a certain bank and a cash shop competed to come out.

<h3>Floating Profits Released, Government Bonds Suddenly Rebound, Drop Degree is Abnormal: E-Type is Still Larger than B-Type</h3>
<p>The government bond underground market rebounded yesterday due to the release of floating profits. The opening was falsely raised, extremely chaotic, and then fell due to insufficient support. The A and B types fell more, resulting in a special abnormal state, such as the B type being 1 yuan and 2 jiao smaller than the A type, while the E type was still 2 jiao larger than the B type. This kind of abnormal state is often found during major ups and downs, and it can also be seen that the general public is alarming each other, panicking for a while, and not thinking, resulting in this situation. The closing price of the C type was false and unreal. Yesterday, Xinji sold a large amount first, followed by Xie Kangyuan and Runde. Tongli and Tongkang both came out and entered first, and Tongshun's settlement was also extremely surging. Lianyi also sold out, mostly floating profits. Buyers included Tongyuan Lianhe Yongchang Chengkang Renchang Zhenhua Changji Runli Hengxing and other companies.

<h3>The Standard Wife on the Silver Screen</h3>
<p>— Tao Shunsheng</p>
<p>Thoughts on Mona Maris' Divorce</p>
<p>I remember in 1936, Hollywood star Mona Maris married playwright and producer Hob Rou Asser. At that time, he published an article about "Mrs." standard insight: "Men are absolutely weak to women, they cannot resist the offensive of the opposite sex, so wives inevitably encounter competition from the same sex. Pre-marital competition is preliminary, and post-marital competition is large-scale and long-term. Originally, love is selfish, but this selfishness should be a kind of understanding selfishness. Another synonym for marriage should be happiness. If sadness, depression, jealousy and other ingredients slowly erode the garden of marriage, this marriage is bound to fail."</p>
<p>Among Hollywood actresses, Mona Maris is known as the standard wife. Hollywood reporters tell us: In her private life, she is a typical wife, just like on the screen. But news came that Mona divorced Hob Rou in Reno on the first of this month. Presumably, there were sad and depressed ingredients in the garden of marriage.</p>
<p>However, Mona is brave after all. As soon as the first large-scale and long-term competition ended, she immediately began the second long-term competition. According to New York Telegraph: Mona married Harry Johnson, an assistant manager of a famous advertising company, on the fifth day after the divorce (the sixth of this month). I wonder if our standard wife on the screen has the preparation and determination to compete to the end when she opens the prelude to this long-term competition?</p>
<h3>The Chinese Dance Drama Society Performs "Five Planets" and "Indian Dance"</h3>
<p>— Nong</p>
<p>"The first step for Chinese dance drama is to adopt dance postures from old Chinese operas, string them together with plots, and use music to assist the dance to convey the inner voice to the audience, appealing to both ear and eye. In reality, music is the most important, and dance is merely an aid to understanding the music. In Europe, this is called Ballet, which is one of the most elegant arts in the world, because it does not use words, so it is also one of the most international arts. If you want to promote a national art to the world, this is the most direct means. In the United States and the Soviet Union, dance drama occupies a very high position.</p>
<p>The "Dream Awakening at an Ancient Temple" performed by the Chinese Dance Drama Society last year was also an abstract folk tale. The society is a combination of several people who have a deep interest in the creation of Chinese dance drama and the promotion of Chinese music. Among them, the composer, Father Xia Lomo Fu, studied Chinese music more than twenty years ago, and previously composed symphonies such as "Beijing Hutong," which were performed in Peiping, Shanghai, New York, and other places, receiving extremely high praise. The "Five Planets" which is about to be performed, is a short dance drama that was finally released after overcoming various difficulties.</p>
<p>"Five Planets" is based on a Buddhist statue excavated from the Dunhuang cave (this Buddhist statue is a 5th-century artifact, now in the collection of the British Museum). In addition to the Maitreya Buddha in the center, the five planets, Venus, Jupiter, Mercury, Mars, and Saturn, stand around. The story is based on this book and developed with imagination: in Qingnong, these planets, although self-possessed, also play various games just like humans, and then return to their original positions. This is so simple that it cannot even be called a story, yet it contains many beautiful dance postures and melodious music.</p>
<p>New opera that does not completely follow the tunes of Peking opera but creates music based on Chinese folk songs, and musical theatre that combines parts of dialogue, singing, and dancing, will all be theatrical arts that the Chinese Dance Drama will attempt and establish after its trials are successful.</p>
<p>Chinese dance has not yet been discovered and promoted, and like music, after a period of revival and development, it will be one of the most magnificent and beautiful treasures in the world of art. Regarding this point, even today, it is generally recognized by many foreigners who understand Chinese art.</p>
<p>In addition to the one-act dance drama "Five Planets," there are also several individual small dances: "Horse Archery," "Swimming," "　　," "Fishing," and "Expedition," etc.</p>
<p>These sections are all performed by famous Kunqu opera actress Ma Liyun, amateur actor Chen Zhong, etc. Ma Liyun is a name we are more familiar with. "Last winter, she was still acting in the Gold Theater, and two or three years ago, she also performed the spoken drama "Thunderstorm" with Zhou Jiefang and others. She is a Peking opera actress with ambitions to improve Peking opera." Chen Zhong played Min Yong in "Dream Awakening at an Ancient Temple" last year, and his results were very good. There is also "Indian Dance", starring the famous Indian dance expert Indira Devi.</p>
<p>Chinese dance drama and Indian dance will be performed at the Lyceum Theatre from yesterday to tomorrow, every afternoon at 5:15.</p>
<h3>My Opinion on "Spring Water Love Waves"</h3>
<p>— Zheng Binling</p>
<p>"Spring Water Love Waves" is a Venus production, the content narrates that a student, Tang Shusheng, who studied abroad, falls in love with Ah Mao, a female servant in his family who was used as collateral for debt, and one night, he cannot restrain himself and has a relationship with her. Later, Shusheng goes north to become an official, and Ah Mao and her mother cannot go with him due to their different identities. Shusheng, having ascended to officialdom, indulges in pleasure, first has an affair with the socialite Han Qiong, and then marries his cousin Hu Xiaoyu, while Ah Mao of the past is long forgotten. Since Ah Mao had a one-night stand, she had a son, but due to the environment, she could not survive, so she avoided entering a nursery. The person in charge of the nursery is founding a reclamation corps, and Ah Mao resolutely joins and travels far away with them. Passing by Shusheng's residence, they meet, but Shusheng denies her. Before long, Shusheng's affair with Han Qiong is discovered by his wife, so both women successively leave him. Shortly thereafter, Shusheng tracks down the reclamation corps, hoping to rekindle his dream with Ah Mao, but is rejected by Ah Mao.</p>
<p>Director Huang Han, this is his debut work, but his technique is sophisticated, and his organization is well-organized, not inferior to his predecessors. The only shortcoming is that the tense scenes are not tense enough. In terms of acting, Xu Feng's Shusheng, Hu Feng's Ah Mao, Wang Yexu's Tang father, Qin Wei's Liu Zihe, and Ouyang Shafei's Han Qiong are all quite suitable for their personalities, so their performances are natural, and the other actors also perform well. In terms of cinematography, there are several quite innovative shots. For example, the Tang father's hope that his son will become a high official and his marriage to his cousin are both shown in photographs, which can be said to be much better than verbal descriptions. On the whole, this film is still a successful work, but unfortunately the film is too short, and it only lasts for one hour and fifteen minutes, so the audience may not have enough fun.</p>
<h3>Showbiz Scene</h3>
<p>— Xin Juan</p>
<p>In the past, Rongwei Company was limited to the Dragon Gate Theatre due to location constraints. Recently, they signed a contract with the Lyceum Theatre and performed Ba Jin's "Autumn" and Wei Yuqian's "Birds of a Feather" at the Lyceum and Dragon Gate respectively, with excellent results. It has been learned that the company plans to successively perform the following plays: "Sherlock Holmes" (sequels), written by Cheng Jiu and directed by Yao Ke. "The Eldest Son" original by Galsworthy, adapted and directed by Zuo Lin. "Spring is Gone" written by Yao Ke and directed by Zhu Duanjun. "The Great Thunderstorm" adapted by Hu Dao. "Banquet" written by Shi Huafu.</p>

<h3>Riding the Storm Together</h3>
<p>— He Jiaji</p>
<p>(5) Retaliation</p>
<p>Fei Changhe and his gang left with smug looks on their faces, and Qin Runzhi also suddenly thought of something and hurried out to chase after them. Ah Xing and He Ma and others were still whispering under the eaves. Wei Cheng glanced at them and asked, "Where is He Zixing?" Ah Xing said, "He went to pick up the Second Madam." Wei Cheng said, "Who told him to pick her up? Wouldn't it have been better to let the Second Madam stay at the Zhang's house for another day?" Ah Xing lowered his head and said nothing. Wei Cheng asked again whose idea it was. Ye Er Madam came in from outside, asking all the way, "Where is the person, where is the person?" This was almost a way to relieve Ah Xing. Wei Cheng greeted her from inside. Seeing that Ye Er Madam had her velvet rope short coat in her hand, and her hair was blown by the river wind, he concluded that she had not used pomade today: He Zixing followed behind, holding a large bundle of red sugarcane in his hand. Wei Cheng hurriedly called out: "Aunt, why did you come back?" Ye Er Madam said: "I heard that Fei Changhe brought a bunch of foxes and dogs to our house to extort money, and there is also Qin Runzhi acting as a smiling tiger. Where are they?" Wei Cheng smiled and said, "It's not as serious as Aunt said, He Zixing must have made a mountain out of a molehill. Aunt, they're gone." Ye Er Madam saw Magpie taking a broom and sweeping in the Shuangmei Study, so she walked into the Shuangmei Study. Wei Cheng said, "They really are gone. How is Yi Yi's health, is she completely healed? It's very good, she's been staying there quietly for a few days, but He Zixing insisted on inviting you back. Ye Er Madam said, "They're gone, they wouldn't leave if they didn't get any benefit, how much money did you give them?" Wei Cheng said, "Not much, Aunt knows, I'm afraid you'll be heartbroken." Ye Er Madam said, "Tell me. What is this on the table, like a land deed?" Wei Cheng said, "This is the contract that Fei Changhe made, and he won't come to borrow money again in the future." Ye Er Madam saw that it was three hundred dollars, and she clicked her tongue, complaining that Wei Cheng had no experience in dealing with the world, and that the money was spent meaninglessly. Wei Cheng blushed and thought, it was indeed a bit unfair to the elders, and his own wealth made Aunt unhappy. (101) (End of this section)</p>
