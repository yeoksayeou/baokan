<h3>肅清毳手聲中暴露毳手眞面目組織嚴密活動領域廣泛</h3>
<p>本報專訪</p>
<p>工部局警務處積極施行肅清毳手運動每日平均拘獲二十名至三十名之多自十月六日發動以來輕徵竊案業已減少同時法租界警務處近日調動大批探員在界內各處從事搜捕毳手黨警務處某要員表示肅清毳手之有效方法厥在市民對警方作密切協助云</p>
<h3>毳字之探討</h3>
<p>毳手據說是三百六十行之一有師承有業規組織嚴密只是局外人不大容易明瞭其內幕而已考毳字許氏說文不載康熙字典亦不錄其為近代產物蓋無疑義造字的人相當聰明因為這字頗合乎六書中的會意當他們作法之　失主茫然不覺旁人視若無賭一殺蟲那間財物轉移似乎比普通人多一條妙手似的故從三手</p>
<h3>小錢改用刀片</h3>
<p>集會場所菜館戲院電車上總之人頭愈擁擠情緒愈緊張也就愈合他們理想所用的法寶已往是兩個康熙小錢磨成極薄鋒利無比近年聽說已經進步改用剃刀片了他們行事時大概有同黨在一起避諱如在電車上一旦找著對象先是一人在你面前一推你略略震動另一人連忙用刀片把內衣割破皮夾落下隨手接住其間手法敏捷眞所謂間不容髮尤其神奇的乃是他們刀法之輕重必須恰到好處維也納內衣不同於老布短襖印度綢與嗶嘰更有厚薄之別重則易被察覺輕則創口太小皮夾無從落下要不然對付紡綢內衣用力一割刀鋒直入失主股膚皮夾未必到手傷害罪已告成立豈非糟糕</p>
<h3>欲擒故縱妙計</h3>
<p>此外如何認清目的也是比較艱難的功夫中裝的口袋分左右著西裝的老是把皮夾藏在屁股後面看上去飽滿的隆起的或者是日記簿煙盒之類毳手應付這種疑難局面往往用欲擒故給之計突然高聲叫擠得來當心袋袋謹愼的人經此一提醒都不免按一下自己藏錢所在這無異說明此地無銀三十兩而第二幕也便是隔壁王二不曾偷了</p>
<h3>失物可以歸趙</h3>
<p>毳手有黨的組織大概非經過嚴密訓練不會出道分區活動秩序井然據記者所知失主要是熱悉門檻的話請託此中人物化些小費可以把失去的財物收回他們的衝語謂之轉趙但以三天為限這是事實一位姓張的朋友便曾用這個方法收回一束重要文件</p>
<h3>一個外國故事</h3>
<p>某作家遊歷歐美歸來告訴記者美國著名毳手茄克遜(Eddile　Jackson)稱霸中西部各洲同業尊為一代宗匠毳技精絕警局都沒奈何他有一位老實紳士因為常遭茄克遜的親睞恨極了有一次特地把廢紙裝成錢袋模樣其中寫有兩句云今番上了老夫的當了豬玀期待數天結果并未毳去這使老實紳士感到無上驚奇暗想這壞蛋的乘覺眞不可及然而使了驚奇的還不止此當他將錢袋解開檢點時卻發覺字句已赫然改成別開玩笑吧豬玀</p>
<h3>表演神妙技術</h3>
<p>肅清毳手是一件德政記者以為對付毳手降了和臭蟲一樣勤捉之外把預防常識灌輸給市民也頗切要從前常見一種影片旨在分析運動動作開映時先是急劇活動鏡頭之後便把片子掏得特別遲緩使一舉手一投足的動作過程清晰地表現出來為今之計警務當局正不妨叫捉來的許多毳手表演其各式各類找　神妙技術攝成影片巡廻放映俾市民一體瞭然他們第三隻手活動的過程而知所戒備則收效必宏（勤孟）</p>

<h3>節省家庭消耗補助清寒學生膳食費</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>現在什麼東西都是非常之貴而在學青年的膳食更成問題一部份因為家屬不在上海起居簡陋一部份因為學費的負擔已經很重並無餘力再去應付膳食</p>
<p>在學的青年大都在發育期間他們所需的營養比其他各時期年齡的人為多而且求學時間更須有集中的思想然而吃飯尚成問題怎談到這許多呢</p>
<p>不過這在青年的數目在上海的總人口數中終究還是很小的部份換句話說上海尚不乏可以餘資去補助他們的人如果我們可以從家庭消耗方面可能地加以節制那就可以把節省下來的錢去補助這些清寒學生了</p>
<p>為善最樂我們想到自己的幸福就可以為清寒者表示同情而起來援助他們</p>
<p>（按青年會現正成立補助清寒學生膳食捐款委員會統盤籌劃辦理救濟事宜讀者如有此項捐中逕送八仙橋該會）</p>
<h3>促膝談心</h3>
<p>— 思</p>
<p>從前有人去問一個小說家他認為最快樂的是什麼時候他的回答是四隻腳　在壁爐架上他的意思就是夫婦兩人在一處靜靜地談心這下是我國人所謂促炎心了</p>
<p>的確我們如果沒有什麼奪得望那末嘗擺脫工作的煩腦孩了們自顧自地在遊嬉屋子裹靜悄悄地沒有聲響夫婦兩人在一處談談家常回憶過去檢討現在討劃將來眞可說是人生樂事了</p>
<p>這原因非常簡單因為家庭生活可以分為物質的與精神的兩方面有許多家庭物質的享受達於極點但他們的精神是痛苦的無寗少一點物質的享受而得到精神的安慰</p>
<p>而且抱著這種精神那末正合乎室雅何須大花香不在多的生活藝術了</p>
<h3>兒童的情緒</h3>
<p>— 桂質良醫師</p>
<p>人類在嬰兒時代情緒緒有相當的發育所以劇烈的響聲或是將托抱的人手驟然挪開會使嬰兒發生驚怕的表示小手小腳被約束的時候也要發怒的大哭反之嬰兒啼哭的時候若是輕輕地在他身上撫摸他會感覺舒服而停止他的啼哭</p>
<p>簡單的說情緒是有益於人的比如怕懼在人類求生存的過程中是自衛的要具知道火燄的利害才能避免焦灼的痛苦畏懼留級的恥辱才能使許多兒童努力用功適宜的競爭心可以勉勵不少事業的成功總括而論適中的情緒衝動是有益的但是劇烈的懷緒衝動或是不合理的衝動是不健康的</p>
<p>什麼情緒是合理的呢喪失至親不免悲慟但是這種悲哀與患有精神病的人整日整夜的可憐自己是完全不同的兒童因為新年快到或是某某同學約會期近心中高興不肯照常安睡是可原諒的學校中成績不好心中煩悶也是自然的反應這些都是合乎情理的反應</p>
<p>情緒衝動也會影響生理的作用身體倦乏失望憂鬰往往會感覺頭能和頭眩考試期間或其他情緒緊張的時候小便特多害怕的時候皮膚顏色慘白心慌脈搏細弱胃口不佳這些徵象若是短時間的那末環境變遷以後情緒亦隨之消滅是通常的反應若是反應過份劇烈或是時間太長那就是不健康的表示了</p>
<p>在比較普通的各種情緒中忌姑要算第一頭生的兒童因為他是一家的中心父母親友的整個注意力都集中在他的身上忽然有了弟妹要侵佔他的天下往往會發生姑忌的心聰明的父母好好的利用兒童的責任心使他幫忙預備新弟妹的來到</p>
<p>兒童的發脾氣是常見的除了低能的兒童以外這般行為是由於家庭或學校教育無方這些哭嚎啼叫的兒童正在試騐他的長輩若是他們屈服他暫時可以停止哭鬧但是手中已握有得勝的利器以後隨時隨地遇有不順意的事更要哭跳打滾因為他已經知道經久的優勝是屬他的對於這類兒童我們要首先檢察他的身體有沒有生體方面的刺流激使他的情緒不穏定不要輕信靜養補血的治療因為這般治療使兒童自憐要求更特別的注意而做父母的要節制自己的情緒因為兒童是最聰明的觀察家他們若是窺見父親在家滿肚惱騷母親終日議論鄰居他也會效法榜樣的所以做父母的必須以身作則否則就要失去管理兒童的權利</p>
<p>對於兒童的本身我們當採取不問不聞的態度在情緒激昂的時候任何人不會肯聽勸告的是最好不睬他兒童發脾氣的時候他期望成人屈服或是靜候刑罰無論如何得到些注意若他見不睬他他得不著一點注意他會非常失望以後不會再犯這種毛病了</p>
<p>做父母的或是做師長的當深切的認識情緒不穏定的兒童前途未可樂觀因為父母決不能因為保護他而對他屈服一生一旦父母棄世誰有同樣的愛心耐心順從他一切的要求他日後的孤苦伶仃苦痛煩悶不堪設想所以眞心愛護兒童的父母一定先要訓練兒童節制他的情緒</p>

<h3>Frontline Silence for a Month and a Half, North Africa Sees Renewed Fierce Fighting: Cairo Announces Offensive Launched, German Army Also Warns of Preparations to Respond</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 24th (Allied News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>According to news from Cairo and Berlin today, the British Eighth Army on the Egyptian Alamein front launched an attack on Axis positions last night, breaking the month-and-a-half-long silence on that line. During this period, the weather was harsh, with sandstorms obscuring the sky and hindering military operations. Now, fierce fighting has resumed along the line. Both British and German sources report that fierce battles are developing, but clear information cannot be obtained from these reports, nor is it known whether the British attack was successful. Cairo sources said that the British offensive had strong air support, but Berlin did not indicate the trend of the battle, only stating that the Axis forces had launched a spring offensive in North Africa three months ago, traversing Libya and reaching Egyptian territory, within 100 miles of Alexandria, the British naval base, posing an unprecedented threat to Egypt.</p>
<p>Cairo, 24th (Havas News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>The British Middle East Command has just announced that the British Eighth Army began launching an offensive on the Egyptian front last night, and a major battle is underway.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 24th (Reuter's News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>A Cairo war report stated that the British Eighth Army, with the assistance of the Air Force, launched an offensive in Egypt last night and is currently engaged in fierce fighting. From the night of the 22nd to the 23rd, the Allied Air Force continued to put pressure on enemy airfields, shooting down eight German aircraft and destroying many Axis warplanes. A Taito aircraft was shot down by us.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 24th (Reuter's News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>British military officials in Cairo stated that the offensive launched by the British Eighth Army last night was intended to defeat the Axis forces in North Africa and thereby determine the fate of the Mediterranean. In the days before the British launched this offensive, British aircraft bombed Rommel's lines of communication.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 24th (Reuter's News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>News of the British Eighth Army launching an offensive on the Egyptian front quickly spread to London. Although the British people knew that the British and Americans would take action in Africa, they did not expect it to be so fast. People in London were skeptical about whether the British and Americans could launch a large-scale offensive, but this news brought some relief. The British have recently publicized their preparations for North Africa, so people have a strong impression that a major war will occur in North Africa, especially the large-scale air battles on the Egyptian front.</p>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Reuter's News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Reuter's military reporter Steelfried wrote that the British Eighth Army launched an attack on the German positions in Alamein last night and is currently engaged in fierce fighting. Details are unknown. According to the British, the British offensive was assisted by the Air Force. According to the German-Italian Allied forces' offensive this spring, they have penetrated deep into Egypt, about 100 kilometers from Alexandria, making it impossible for the British to defend their position in Egypt, greatly threatening their prestige in the Near East countries. At the same time, the German-Italian air bases are also close to the Nile region, and Axis aircraft can bomb the naval bases in Alexandria and the Suez Canal area. Therefore, the British have long wanted to obtain American assistance to launch a counter-offensive to consolidate their position. The German army was prepared to respond to the British offensive.</p>

<h3>A Great Fire Occurred Yesterday Afternoon in Yangjiadu, Pudong, Destroying Over 5,000 Shantytowns and Covering an Area of Three Li</h3>
<p>At 10:30 AM yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out in the shantytown at No. 1675 Beicaonitang, south of Yangjiadu, Pudong, at the home of Gao Changnian, a native of Yangzhou, due to carelessness. The fire quickly intensified, and the wind fanned the flames, making it impossible to extinguish. The area was filled with shantytowns of poor migrant workers, densely packed like pigeon coops, so the fire spread rapidly and uncontrollably. Soon, firefighting boats from the Customs Water Police Station and the Pudong District Fire Brigade arrived one after another to extinguish the fire, which was finally put out at 1:00 PM. It is estimated that the fire burned about 5,000 households, covering an area of about three li. During the height of the fire, Yang Jin’s six-year-old daughter, Liu Juzi, was buried in the flames, and Liu Changshun’s three-month-old son was also burned to death. Many livestock also perished, and the cries of mourning were deafening, a truly unprecedented disaster.</p>
<p>The English-language North China Daily News reported that several hundred poor people lived in Yangjiadu Village (transliterated) in Pudong. Due to carelessness, a fierce fire broke out this morning (the 24th). From the Bund, across from the Roosevelt Wharf, a plume of thick smoke billowed up, not dissipating even in the afternoon. Upon receiving the news, the Water Fire Brigade dispatched the Puji (transliterated) fireboat to Pudong to assist in extinguishing the fire. Another fireboat also set off from its berth in Yangshupu to assist. As of noon, the Harbor Master's Office had not yet received a detailed report, so it was unknown whether any large warehouses, factories, or wharf buildings were affected or threatened by the fire. It is generally believed that since the fireboats could not reach far and the Pudong fire brigade was poorly equipped, the material damage would be extremely significant. It was reported that the fire started around 10:00 AM, and by 11:00 AM, black smoke began to rise into the sky, visible from the opposite bank of the Huangpu River.</p>

<h3>Government Bonds Surge Amid Speculation</h3>
<p>Government bonds on the unofficial market surged yesterday amidst speculation. All bonds rebounded strongly, rising by two yuan or several jiao. A good phenomenon occurred on Saturday. It can be confirmed that there are no problems with the government bonds themselves. However, the speed of the rebound was unexpected, mainly due to too many short positions. Series D bonds quickly rebounded to 60 yuan. It is easy to imagine that it is difficult for them to fall but easy to rise. Yesterday, Series C bonds opened at 63.5 yuan, with the high price reaching 5.75 yuan. All prices rose in a straight line, fluctuating sharply. The market prices ultimately rebounded by two yuan and one jiao across the board. St. Tan rose by one yuan and four jiao, and 96 bonds rose by one yuan and two jiao.

<h3>Cloth Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Mill Cloth</p>
<p>Market sentiment continues to rise, mainly due to stable raw material prices and optimistic sentiment. Yesterday, white cloth prices also increased by 5 jiao to 1 yuan per bolt. 16-pound Earth coarse cloth was at 201 yuan. The same weight of Feihong was at 198 yuan. 9-pound New Character was at 113 yuan. 8-pound Zhenzhong was at 110 yuan. 12-pound Earth fine cloth was at 171 yuan. Dapeng New Single was at 167.5 yuan.

<h3>Continuous Acquisition of Large Tinplate</h3>
<p>The 24-gauge and 26-gauge large tinplate circulating in the market have been continuously acquired by yarn factories and others for making rollers every day. The available stock is becoming increasingly scarce. At the same time, those in the industry who hold the remaining stock are extremely shrewd. Although only a dozen or so sheets have been traded, prices have reached a new high. Currently, 24-gauge is selling for 150 yuan per sheet, and 26-gauge is selling for 130 yuan per sheet, both up 10 yuan per sheet compared to the previous market. In addition, other hardware items, such as new angle iron, are at 16,000 yuan per ton. New Russian leather is at 14,000 yuan. New foreign square plates are at 12,000 yuan. Cement rebar and foreign square plate angle iron heads are all selling for 10,000 yuan per ton (prices for the above items are subject to slight increases). Prices are high, and sales are sluggish.</p>
<h3>Amidst the Crackdown on Pickpockets, the True Face of Pickpockets is Exposed: Well-Organized, Wide Range of Activities</h3>
<p>Special Report from This Newspaper</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department is actively carrying out the crackdown on pickpockets, arresting an average of 20 to 30 people every day. Since the campaign began on October 6th, minor theft cases have decreased. At the same time, the French Concession Police Department has recently mobilized a large number of detectives to conduct searches for pickpocket gangs in various parts of the concession. A senior official of the Police Department stated that the most effective way to crack down on pickpockets is for citizens to closely assist the police.</p>
<h3>An Exploration of the Term "Pickpocket"</h3>
<p>It is said that pickpocketing is one of the 360 trades, with apprenticeship and industry regulations, and a well-organized structure. However, it is not easy for outsiders to understand its inner workings. According to Xu Shen's Shuowen Jiezi, the character "pickpocket" is not found, and it is also not recorded in the Kangxi Dictionary. It is undoubtedly a product of modern times. The person who created the character was quite clever because this character is quite in line with the ideographic principles of the Six Writing Styles. When they commit their acts, the victim is unaware, and onlookers are indifferent. In that instant, property is transferred as if they had an extra skillful hand compared to ordinary people, hence the three hands.</p>
<h3>Small Coins Replaced by Razor Blades</h3>
<p>The more crowded the place and the more tense the mood, the more ideal it is for them. In the past, their treasures were two Kangxi small coins ground to an extremely thin and sharp edge. In recent years, it is said that they have progressed to using razor blades. When they act, they usually have accomplices with them to avoid detection. For example, on a tram, once they find a target, one person will push you in front, and as you shake slightly, another person will quickly use a razor blade to cut through your underwear, and the wallet falls out, which is caught immediately. Their techniques are truly swift, so-called "not allowing even a hair's breadth." What is especially magical is that the lightness or heaviness of their cutting must be just right. Viennese underwear is different from old cloth short jackets. Indian silk and serge have different thicknesses. If they cut too hard, they will easily be noticed. If they cut too lightly, the incision will be too small, and the wallet will not fall out. Otherwise, if they cut a silk underwear with too much force, the blade will go straight into the victim's buttock skin, and the wallet may not be obtained, but the crime of assault has been committed. Wouldn't that be terrible?</p>
<h3>A Clever Trick: "Feigning Capture to Let Go"</h3>
<p>In addition, how to identify the target is also a relatively difficult skill. Those wearing Chinese clothing have pockets on both sides, while those wearing Western suits always hide their wallets in their back pockets, which look full and bulging, or it could be a diary or cigarette case. Pickpockets often use a trick to deal with this difficult situation: they suddenly shout loudly, "It's crowded, be careful of your pockets!" Careful people cannot help but press the place where they keep their money after this reminder. This is tantamount to saying, "The silver is not buried here!" And the second act is that the Wang Er next door did not steal it.</p>
<h3>Lost Items Can Be Returned</h3>
<p>Pickpockets have a gang organization and are probably not able to "debut" without rigorous training. They operate in designated areas with order. According to the reporter, if the victim is familiar with the ins and outs, they can entrust someone in the pickpocket world, spend a little tip, and recover the lost property. Their slang term for this is "transfer Zhao," but it is limited to three days. This is a fact. A friend named Zhang once used this method to recover a bundle of important documents.</p>
<h3>A Foreign Story</h3>
<p>A certain writer who traveled to Europe and the United States told the reporter that the famous American pickpocket Eddile Jackson reigned supreme in the Midwestern states. His colleagues respected him as a master of his generation. His pickpocketing skills were so exquisite that the police could do nothing about him. A certain honest gentleman, because he was often favored by Jackson, hated him to the extreme. Once, he specially filled a money bag with waste paper and wrote two sentences on it: "This time, you've fallen for my trick, you beast!" He waited for several days, but it was not pickpocketed. This made the honest gentleman feel extremely surprised, thinking that this villain's awareness was truly unmatched. However, the surprise did not end there. When he opened the money bag to inspect it, he found that the sentences had been changed to: "Don't joke around, you beast!"</p>
<h3>Demonstrate Magical Techniques</h3>
<p>Cracking down on pickpockets is a virtuous act. The reporter believes that in addition to diligently catching pickpockets like bedbugs, it is also important to instill preventive knowledge in citizens. In the past, a kind of film was often seen, the purpose of which was to analyze sports movements. When the film was shown, it would start with a fast-paced action shot, and then the film would be slowed down so that the action process of each movement would be clearly shown. For today's plan, the police authorities might as well have the many pickpockets they have caught demonstrate their various pickpocketing techniques, filming them and showing them on a tour so that citizens can understand the process of their "third hand" activity and know what to guard against, which will be very effective (Qin Meng).</p>

<h3>Chinese vs. Western Round Gateball Tournament: Nanyang vs. Western Youth Today</h3>
<p>The Chinese vs. Western Round Gateball对抗大賽, with the Chinese champion Nanyang team, is scheduled to play its first match against the Western Youth team at 3:00 PM today at the Guangxia Middle School field at the intersection of Moore Road and Fuxu Road. The referees are Wu Zibin and Zhang Juefei. The Nanyang team has many multi-talented basketball and double-squash players, such as goalkeeper Zhang Banglun and forward Han Longhai, who are particularly well-known. In addition, Xu Xilu and Li Zhuang's defense is impenetrable, and Fan Qingcheng and Han Longquan are all top-notch players. Today, they have also invited famous basketball players Qu Xilin and Qu Xilong to assist, which is most exciting. The blue-and-white main player Bao Songyuan will also play for Nanyang, making a guest appearance as center, which makes them even stronger. The Western Youth team has been engaged in this sport since the spring of this year. In the early summer, they played against the round gateball originator Blue and White, and the result was a narrow defeat by only one goal, 3 to 4. However, their crisp and sharp style has already left a deep impression on the audience. Their lineup includes strong players such as Du Laiye, Long Gong, Sasha Jin, Feng Kaikeman, Miluofu, Founike, Smith's Wei and her husband, and Taoblinji's center defense. With Sasha Jin guarding the goal, the lineup is complete and very ideal. This time, they are making a comeback and will surely pose a serious threat to Nanyang. The competition will be decided by a best-of-three series for the championship. The date of the second match will be announced soon. In addition, the English translation of round gateball has been determined to be Areh Ball, which means "semi-circular arc shape," which is very accurate.</p>

<h3>Saving Household Expenses to Subsidize Meal Expenses for Impoverished Students</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Everything is very expensive now, and meal expenses for young students are even more problematic. Some students have simple living arrangements because their families are not in Shanghai, and some have already burdened themselves with tuition fees and have no extra resources to cover meal expenses.</p>
<p>Students are mostly in the developmental stage, and they require more nutrition than people of other ages. Moreover, studying requires focused thinking. However, if even eating is a problem, how can we talk about so much else?</p>
<p>However, the number of students is still a small part of the total population of Shanghai. In other words, Shanghai does not lack people who can afford to subsidize them. If we can possibly control household expenses, we can use the money saved to subsidize these impoverished students.</p>
<p>Doing good is the greatest joy. When we think of our own happiness, we can express sympathy for the impoverished and rise up to help them.</p>
<p>(Note: The YMCA is now establishing a fundraising committee to subsidize meal expenses for impoverished students to comprehensively plan and carry out relief efforts. Readers who wish to make donations can send them directly to the YMCA at Baxianqiao.)</p>
<h3>Heart-to-Heart Talk</h3>
<p>— Si</p>
<p>Someone once asked a novelist what he thought was the happiest time. His answer was "four feet on the fireplace rack." He meant that the husband and wife were quietly talking heart-to-heart together. This is what our countrymen call "conversing intimately."</p>
<p>Indeed, if we have nothing to hope for, we can get rid of work worries, and the children are playing on their own. The house is quiet and silent. The husband and wife can talk about everyday family matters, reminisce about the past, review the present, and plan for the future. It can truly be said to be the joy of life.</p>
<p>The reason is very simple because family life can be divided into material and spiritual aspects. Many families have reached the extreme in material enjoyment, but their spirits are in pain. It is better to have less material enjoyment and get spiritual comfort.</p>
<p>And holding this spirit is in line with the art of living: "A humble room is fine; why must it be large? Fragrance is not in abundance; it is in quality."</p>
<h3>Children's Emotions</h3>
<p>— Dr. Gui Zhiliang</p>
<p>Human emotions have a considerable development in infancy, so a violent sound or suddenly moving the hands of the person holding the baby will cause the baby to show signs of fear. When the baby's little hands and feet are restrained, it will also get angry and cry loudly. Conversely, when a baby cries, gently stroking its body will make it feel comfortable and stop its crying.</p>
<p>Simply put, emotions are beneficial to people. For example, fear is a means of self-defense in the process of human survival. Knowing the dangers of flames can avoid the pain of being scorched. Fearing the shame of failing a grade can make many children work hard. Appropriate competitiveness can encourage the success of many careers. In summary, moderate emotional impulses are beneficial, but violent emotional impulses or unreasonable impulses are unhealthy.</p>
<p>What emotions are reasonable? Losing a close relative inevitably causes grief, but this sorrow is completely different from someone with a mental illness pitying themselves all day and night. It is excusable for children to be happy because the New Year is approaching or because a certain classmate has an upcoming date, and they refuse to go to sleep as usual. It is also a natural reaction to feel troubled by poor grades in school. These are all reasonable reactions.</p>
<p>Emotional impulses can also affect physiological functions. Physical fatigue, disappointment, and depression often cause headaches and dizziness. During exams or other times of emotional stress, urination is frequent. When frightened, the skin turns pale, the heart races, the pulse is weak, and the appetite is poor. If these symptoms are short-lived, then the emotions will disappear as the environment changes, which is the usual reaction. If the reaction is too violent or lasts too long, it is a sign of unhealthiness.</p>
<p>Among the more common emotions, jealousy is the first to consider. The firstborn child is the center of the family, and the entire attention of parents, relatives, and friends is focused on them. Suddenly, a younger sibling arrives to invade their world, and jealousy often arises. Smart parents will make good use of the child's sense of responsibility to help them prepare for the arrival of the new sibling.</p>
<p>Children's tantrums are common. Except for children with intellectual disabilities, this behavior is due to improper family or school education. These crying and wailing children are testing their elders. If they give in, they can temporarily stop crying, but they have grasped the winning weapon in their hands, and they will cry, jump, and roll around whenever they encounter unpleasant things in the future because they already know that prolonged victory belongs to them. For this kind of child, we must first check whether there is any physiological stimulation that makes their emotions unstable. Do not easily believe in treatments that promote rest and blood enrichment, because these treatments make the child self-pity, demand more special attention, and the parents must control their own emotions, because children are the smartest observers. If they see their father full of anger at home and their mother gossiping about the neighbors all day long, they will also imitate them. Therefore, parents must lead by example, otherwise, they will lose the right to manage their children.</p>
<p>For the child themselves, we should adopt a "do not ask, do not listen" attitude. When emotions are high, no one will be willing to listen to advice. It is best to ignore them. When a child throws a tantrum, they expect adults to give in or wait for punishment. In any case, they get some attention. If they see that they are ignored and they do not get any attention, they will be very disappointed and will not repeat this behavior in the future.</p>
<p>Parents or teachers should deeply understand that the future of emotionally unstable children is not optimistic. Because parents can never protect them by giving in to them for life, once the parents die, who will have the same love, patience, and obedience to all their demands? Their future loneliness, pain, and annoyance are unimaginable. Therefore, parents who truly love their children must first train them to control their emotions.</p>

<p>Family Mailbox</p>
<p>Mr. Editor:</p>
<p>I am a young man of marriageable age and I also hope to have a family to call home. However, due to my economic circumstances, I cannot fulfill my wish. Furthermore, I did not find a suitable match before leaving vocational school, so I inevitably feel pessimistic about my outlook on life. I have long admired your publication and the writers for being a beacon of light for those in difficulty. I dare to ask you to answer the following small questions on my behalf:</p>
<p>(1) How can one cultivate optimism in life and suppress the occurrence of pessimism? (2) What is the latest age a man can postpone marriage? (3) Can a satisfying result come from getting to know someone through introduction? (4) What are the necessary conditions for marriage and how to manage a typical household?</p>
<p>Respectfully, Feng</p>

Now, we will answer your questions below. (1) It is not difficult to cultivate optimism in life. You can find legitimate pastimes or establish a plan for advancement and follow that plan.

(2) As long as the reason is acceptable, there is no limit to the age a man can marry. (3) Yes, it is possible. In fact, getting to know each other between men and women must go through procedures, and you can also hear about the other person's general situation from the introducer.

As for the necessary conditions, there are physical health, similarity of interests, beauty of the environment, common cooperation, etc. Due to space constraints, it cannot be fully described.

<h3>Twenty Letters from the Ge Family</h3>
<p>— Sincerely, Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>Mr. Ge Laiheng's son has been promoted from the position of managing mail to being a bookkeeper. This made him very happy, so he specifically wrote a letter to express his joy and give him some encouragement.</p>
<p>Mr. Ge Laiheng does not treat his own child as a spoiled brat and puts business first in everything. This can also be said to be worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>Eighth Letter</p>
<p>Promotion and salary increase. The doctor here is treating me for rheumatism. He says that it can be cured in about thirty days, so I think I can return to Chicago in about two weeks. My doctor is just like some doctors. He can cure poor people two weeks earlier, and he needs two weeks for rich people. He claims to be a specialist, but I think that is the reason why he charges ten dollars for every time he looks at my tongue.</p>
<p>But this is not the intended beginning of my letter. What I want to tell you is that I was unspeakably happy to read your letter saying that you have been promoted from the position of mail manager to bookkeeper. I feel very gratified that your superiors can actually appreciate you.</p>
<p>I used to hire a Kryto, who had lost his mother. His father had worked for me as a bookkeeper before he died. In the first three weeks of the month, he always put away the ledgers half an hour before the end of office hours, and at the end of the fourth week, he worked overtime every day to find the eight cents that was missing. After he passed away, his wife found that his life insurance had expired for a month, so she brought her children to the company to ask me for a job.</p>
<p>In my opinion, Krelan was not a lovely child, but just a miniature of his father. However, his mother thought he was a very remarkable talent. I felt it was difficult to refuse her plea, so I assigned him to be an errand boy. His mother couldn't help but shed tears as she watched him leave her arms, and repeatedly asked me to take care of him. There were many jokes that morning. He was looking for things in the ashtray, it turned out that he was smoking, but since it was his first day at the company, no one paid attention to him. However, not long after, a customer came from Barton, leading a child wearing velvet pants. While the customer and I were discussing the terms of the contract, the child inadvertently walked to the place where the errand boys ate, and Krelan actually started to play with the child. As a result, the customer cancelled the contract and criticized my company as a place with a bad environment. I had no choice but to immediately fire Krelan, although his mother said many complaints, blaming me for burying her husband's whole life and refusing to promote her children.</p>
<p>The reason I cite this example is simply to let you know that my policy is that I am very slow to decide on my judgment, so I want you to work under Mr. Millingen so that I can understand you through his eyes. If he thinks you can be promoted to bookkeeper and receive a salary of twelve yuan, I don't think there will be any mistakes.</p>
<p>Of course, I am very happy to see talents gradually progressing, whether he is my child or not, so I hope that this promotion for you is the starting point for your rise, and I wish you a bright future.</p>
<p>Your loving father, Ge Laiheng</p>
