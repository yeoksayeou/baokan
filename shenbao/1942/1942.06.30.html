<h3>德義軍事當局宣稱　攻佔瑪薩瑪特魯　軸心軍繼續向東推進英集中空軍保衛埃及</h3>
<p>羅馬二十九日同盟社電　義軍司令部今日宣佈、軸心軍已於今晨奪佔埃及邊界內一百三十哩之瑪薩瑪特魯、</p>
<p>柏林二十九日海通社電　據德軍事當局稱、距埃及邊境二百公里之英軍要塞瑪薩瑪特魯業被軸心國軍隊攻陷、德義聯軍賡續向東推進、</p>
<p>羅馬廿九日海通社電　瑪薩瑪特魯陷落之訊、引起義大利全國之歡欣、英國通信社昨已開始警告人民準備瑪薩瑪特魯之陷落、因接濟成為問題、故該地甚難扼守、良以自英國運輸供應至該處戰塲之船隻、於十月問始能抵達、至自直布羅陀經過地中海之海道雖為最速與最短之路、但取道該綫甚為危險、至於軸心國軍隊可自義國直接獲得供應、羅馬方面認英國通信社所作之遁辭甚為牽強、因瑪薩瑪特魯為鐵道綫之終點、有完善之鐵道設備、可自亞歷山大運輸接濟、此綫直至該地失陷前二十四小時始被截斷、英方所稱軸心國軍隊獲得接濟、較為簡便之說、義國方面並不贊同、因德義軍隊深入敵境、其供應綫為之延長、且在沙漠中作戰之軍隊依賴後方之接濟尤為密切、</p>
<p>柏林二十九日海通社電　據德國負責方面稱、德國空軍昨在北非作大規模之活動、追繫退却中之英軍及轟炸軍事及交通設備、德機在富加區域及亞歷山大之東攻擊滿載戰具及軍隊之英國火車數列、兵車二列及運載汽車之火車一列被毀、尚有運載戰具之火車一列起火受創、對英軍極為重耍之海岸鐵道有數處中彈截斷、該綫沿錢之車站亦遭猛襲、開赴前綫之英軍汽車及坦克車隊被德機低飛攻擊、損失甚大、摩明蒲薩克飛機傷遭德機數批之轟炸、停在地面上之飛機及機庫皆中單、</p>
<p>里斯本二十九日同盟社電　開羅消息未設實羅馬與柏林宣布之攻佔瑪薩瑪特魯事、僅謂非洲大戰、昨在瑪薩瑪特魯迤南沙漠地激烈進行、而協約軍竭力阻擋德方非洲軍團之機械化部隊、是役結果或將決定中東與地中海之命運、開羅消息又傳星期六午後。兩軍各傾全力作沙漢大戰、終夜求已、至昨晨戰况倍見激烈、德軍現距其最近之根據地杜白魯克已二百四十哩、惟衆信此項因素、不致减其前進之銳勢、開羅發表之公報對瑪薩瑪特魯四週戰况、所述不詳、僅以該地東南與西南有遭遇戰為言、足見軸心軍巳東進頗遙、英方消息傳北非大戰、仍在以瑪薩瑪特魯與哈姆柴為樞軸、廣約四百方哩之區內進行、英軍顯圖從每一可能方面、向德軍攻擊、但亦承認此乃艱難之任務、蓋軸心軍機械化實力殊龐大、計有德軍第十五與二十一機械化師、及第十九輕兵師、曁義軍三師。</p>

<p>故事的開頭</p>
<p>提起阿刺伯，至少這字眼，在我們腦經裹已經川現過多次了，我們對於這樣一個外國譯名，一點也不感生疏，在我們的日常生活中，遇到記賬算數什麼的，老歡喜用阿刺伯字碼書寫，我們對於這樣一個古老的國度，也許並沒特別好感，但在不知不覺中，我們却接觸着一點牠特有的文明。假如你不太健忘的話，你總還該記起，在那逝去愉快的童年時代中，也許是在那靜謐的黃昏，你懷着一片天眞的歡樂伏在陰暗的屋角裹，手頭抱着一本「天方夜談」津津有味地讀着。你被那遠方國度奇異的故事攪得有點迷亂，那些怪誔的妖術與美麗仙女充塞在你幼稺的心田裏，使你半天被苦惱着。你那時的印象目然極其迷糊，你根本就不知道這阿刺伯究竟她怎樣一個帶有神秘意味的地方。</p>
<p>以後你歲數漸漸大了起來，你又多讀了一點書，在歐美的小說中，我們不難見到這樣的描寫，一個小孩半夜哇的一聲哭了，大人被攪得厭煩不過任是怎麽，哄勸也無用，最後聰明的主婦想出了一個辦法，她低聲對小孩凑着耳朶說，「阿刺伯人來了」，這句短短的話語像具有無限的威力，果然小孩就此止住哭。一個阿刺伯人在一個歐美人的眼光裹看來是個奇異的動物，像一個奔逐於山野的猛獸它可使一個喧鬧的小孩噤噤不響，它的名字也會吏一個膽怯的人戰栗，你讀着這樣的叙述，於是在你的腦　裏更印一層不可　滅頑固的意念，阿刺伯人是條物；是猛獸，是殺人不眨眼的强盜……你小時候那麽想，到大了你還是那麽想。</p>
<p>阿刺伯她怎樣一個傳說中的奇異地方呢？這問題太攏統，我們通常所提起阿刺伯，這字眼所含的意義太廣泛，我們的意思大概都是指這半島的全體而言，這麽說什麽伊拉克，叙利亞等等也都儘包括在內，關於這些在前數章裏已經叙述過了。我們現在講的，祇是指其中一部叫做沙地阿刺伯的地方，阿刺伯是一般人都能懂得的，可加上沙地兩字，就又變得瞠然不知其解其來。實在說沙地阿剌伯這名稱開始出現，也不過是近十年的事。在早先阿刺伯全境均歸土耳共統治，直到上次歐戰，土耳其之勢力才退出，伊拉克克拉克也相繼獨立了。當戰爭繼續時，麥加之中教受英國之慫慂起兵反抗土耳其，成立漢志王國，名義上雖說獨立，但實際上還不過是英國之卵翼政權，但不管如何當時倒也威勢咄咄逼人頗有併吞各部落之雄心。偏就在此時。特地在內志冒出一個叫依奔沙得酋長來，這人倒是個勇謀兼備不可多得之幹才，他先組織一種兄弟會（Ikkvans），以華哈壁民族（Wababites）為基　向外擴展。憑着他超越之智謀，先擊敗鄰近之小部落，當時阿刺伯酋長衆多，每人　據一方，並擁有軍權，與咱們古時之封建制度頗相似。但泰半均係　合之衆，一旦有事。乃望風收竄，依奔沙得似乎並沒怎樣特別費力，就一個接一個，給收拾得個乾凈。一九二四年滅漢志，翌年佔領及得（Djeddal）從此勢力一直擴展至紅海沿岸。再一年亞西爾（Assir）亦被佔領，封為保護地，至此於一九三二年沙地阿刺伯乃正式宣告成立。這新興之國家雖說歷史短促，但經當政者之銳意經營，倒也國運日隆，蒸蒸日上。前幾年與葉鬥起　，要不是列强們出面調解，憑葉門這渺小的國　怕眞不是對手，能不遭滅亡總算幸事。假如不是這次大戰發生，憑着沙地阿刺伯那股新興朝氣，即使統一全部阿刺伯倒也不是不叮能的呢！</p>
<p>在阿刺伯半島，雖然算起來也有近十個國家，獨立國方面有伊拉克；克拉克，代管地有叙利亞；巴勒士坦。酋長國有葉門；科威特·，阿曼三國。此外還有英屬亞了及丕林島，保護即哈達拉毛等等。粗看一下倒也洋洋大觀，　由於阿剌伯人自己不爭氣，多年來一直為外族統治。在前受着土耳其的壓迫，第一次世界大戰後，雖說是個民族自決的好機會，但又給輕易錯過了，除了沙地阿刺伯尚維持一絲獨立國應有之尊嚴外，其他不管是獨立國也好，酋長國也好，實際上還不是列强們之附庸。這塊土地在上古時代，是文明之發源地，從前都曾繁榮一陣子地，隨後衰落了。但它豐富的寶藏依舊叫第三者看得眼紅，於是你爭我奪，早成為列強勢力鬥法的地方。隨着這次世界大戰洪流之侵襲，有許多國家的面目是改變了，像叙利亞已由英軍佔領，伊拉克政府也被改組，到現在為止，表面上看，沙地阿刺伯還好像太太平平，未曾被現行戰爭所攪擾，但觀察近些日子彼此之行動如英美軍增防近東，德國陳兵埃及邊境等等，這都說明一個未來的大風暴她已經潛伏下了。誰能說木來之阿刺伯大規模之沙漢戰不會有今日里比亞之利害呢？</p>
<p>地勢一瞥</p>
<p>沙地阿刺伯之國境，包括阿刺伯牛島之大部，面積約有三百七十萬力公理，但其中百分之九十九（計三百六十三萬方哩）倒趁沙漠，我們如果管牠叫「沙漠之王國」眞一點不過份。在這廣漠無垠的土地上，人口的白分率她異外地稀少，祇佔面積總數八分之一，那就是說才祇四百五十萬人，論面積倒有半個歐洲大，但人口尚不及一個大都市如倫教，紐約來得多，那情形多少與咱們的新疆有點近似。你如果在你的腦筋裹織一幅構圖，你該能意會到阿刺伯之腹地是如何顯得荒凉了。</p>
<p>沙地阿剌伯東北與叙利亞克拉克接壤，西北則是美索不達米亞低地，東部臨波斯灣，往南則是阿刺伯海，西部囊括漢志王國及亞西爾全部，直達紅海，組看起來却似一個幾何上之梯形。沙地阿刺伯全境盡屬高原，山脈綿直，南部沙漢浩瀚，為羅巴厄爾哈里沙漢（Robael　Khali）所在地，這一帶在一切上講與菲洲夕微哈拉大沙漠均無二致。這裹的氣候酷熱·乾燥，一年到頭難得落幾滴雨，一日之內溫度上下個幾十度也是司空見慣的事，早上也許地面上還舖着一層厚甸甸的雪，可是太陽一露臉，那乾亢的熱氣流就使出威力來。正午太陽的火舌像在熔爐翻筋斗，跳上跳下地，人熱啊熱地喘不過氣即使受得住，也倦得要我老想那兒躺他一下。到晚你以為也許會飄過一陣凉風吧，老天爺就似乎從不放棄與你開個玩笑，天還沒漆黑，於是眞的來了風，川那是那般凜冽，漫天灰啊沙啊地　揚起幾丈高，你的眼睛被那厚厚的灰沙弄得睜不開，你低着頭，尖銳的北風在空中呼嘯着，狂吼着，能將整個天地一齊掀起來，你的頸脖裹倒處被冷氣流侵襲着，你望着那漸趨暗弱灰色的天幕，你心頭也給浸得冰凉地，你眞要喊出一聲：一多麽嚴寒的夜晚啊！」</p>
<p>就在巡樣的空氣裹，我們的阿刺伯人是一代接一代地生長起來了，等他們一踏到道土地上，他們　　試到風沙的滋味了。歲數大了，經過不斷的淘冶，他們一個惆都變成健實的小伙子身體魁梧，皮膚略成褐色，在這樣環境長大的人他們目然都是够結實的，從他們有記憶起，他們就在風沙中馳騁着，日子久了，他們都是一羣熟練的騎士，他們的慄悍，勇武可與哥薩克的騎兵相媲美，也就是道樣，人們將阿刺伯人描繪成一個可怪的怖物，眞像他有三頭六臂的精靈般地。</p>
<p>在他們的故鄉的土地上，那裏的一切是如此貧瘠，荒凉，種田嗎，那乾燥的沙石上怕連根草還長不住，那末還趁牧畜吧！可牛啊豬啊地成年連一滴水也見不着，如能養活那才是件怪事。這樣他們不得不離別了家鄉向外尋活路去，他們總不能待着活活餓死，為了生，於　終年拖着一雙流浪者的脚步四處蹀　着。有一陣子他們也許來到一個有水草的地方，於是他們歇下了腿，有一部份人就此建立了茅舍固定安居下來，這往後發展就成為最初城市的雛型。另一部份人待上些日子，於是再繼續那迢遙沒有終結的旅程。在中古世紀裹，阿刺伯人像一支洪流，在世界的每個角落都能尋川他們的足跡他們有的渡越紅　，踏上菲洲大陸，有的則輾轉流陟到印度南洋等地，藉着這批人的移動，早期阿刺伯的文化也開始被遠播開來，就像我們日常通用的阿刺伯字碼，還不是這批人帶出來的嗎？</p>

<h3>集團自殺</h3>
<p>— 波動</p>
<p>合家從人世界屋頂上集團墜地自殺的新聞，決不會在人們的腦膜上　滅；做父親的把毒藥和在粥　逼使全家自殺的新聞，也不是容易使人遺忘的事，而現在，又有做母親的將煤爐窒死全家的慘劇發生，讀報至此，自己彷彿在夢中一樣，有人間何但之慨！</p>
<p>從大世界屋頂上集團墮地自殺到現在，說長罷，已經是五六年；說短罷，也祗有五六年。如果以這三件慘絕人寶　事併在一起看，閉了眼請一想，眞趁一切如在目前一樣，也就是說，我們僅僅過一個短短的時期！可是在這短短的時期中，變化太大了，如此不忍聽間的慘劇就發生了三起之多，零零碎碎的死耗，以及街頭的露屍，自然已引不起人們的注意了。</p>
<p>然而還沒有結束，也許正是開始，在　短的時期中，恐怕將有更慘的新聞發現，一念至此，歎人間何世有什麼用呢！</p>
<p>自殺是勇的，（恕我並不鼓勵自殺但希望以更大的勇氣來遏止自殺，社會應該負起　資仟，也是每個人應該負起這責仟，小過看「做法」如何耳！</p>
<h3>在電車裏</h3>
<p>— 莎</p>
<p>天一下雨，各種事情似乎都改觀了，本來這幾天的天氣並不十分好，天上常常帶着陰　，好像為上就要下雨的樣子。昨天早上起，果然下雨，而且下得很暢。這一塲霉雨的來勢到不能不說甚兇呢。衣食住行，缺一個字不了，天　下下雨，飯不能不　，要吃飯就得跑路。在雨天這「行」字却最不容易解決。</p>
<p>如果一出鬥就喊黃包車，也不講價鈿，聽車夫拖，拖到付錢，那末服現在的人力車價，在戰前，從上三個月之後，就很可以買一輛半新不舊的包車了。黃包車在今日，好像五六年前的雲飛和祥生汽車，非必要時，和兩條腿尚能搬動時，普通人恐怕都有些不「忍」妄自登車罷。</p>
<p>於是電車，雖尚穩快，而價則並不十分廉的電車，即使不楚天下雨，在目下上海的馬路交通上儼然有權威之目，成為大衆的代步恩物了；何况大又下着雨，平時慣乘脚踏車的一班人，也因為雨大風緊，暫時由兩倫改為多輪了。</p>
<p>自從當車漲價以來，起初好像乘客較為少一些，然而幾天之後，猶之一般物價步步高昇，在上下寫字間的時間中，仍舊滿坑滿谷把車廂塞得水洩不通。風雨交加之日，行人怕走路，而且黃包車又貴得那樣怕人，於是雷車又成為代步的騙子了。你看，許多人水淋淋地從站頭擠上車子，拖泥帶水，好不討厭。</p>
<p>好容易坐定下來，覺得車廂裏的氣壓分外低，舉目四顧，原來窗子十扇倒有五扇緊閉着，雨點打在車窗玻璃上，積點成綫，積綫成面，看不見點，望不見綫，玻璃上竟像澆了一桶水；外面淋漓盡　，裹面　人氣氤氳，弄得車窗上白茫茫地一片，也看不淸楚馬路上作何景象。</p>
<p>車子到站，一批批人上來，總算頭等車的入口和出口分得較為淸楚，秩序尚好。但是尙有少數人一時心急要下車，竟向入口衝出去；弄得進者不得進，出者無從出，急得開車的和，　　嘴　有些不　了。好在大家急於出或進，只做充耳不聞，少得有人去理會。結果上來的人多，出去的人少，分　是「　　」。</p>
<p>最近會和友人往靜安寺路一家外人開的店舖，問過雨衣的價鱸，圾便宜的一種大約傷鈔二百八十七元，較好的為三百二十…及以上；女人穿的雨衣，一種透明像蟬翼似的，價亦不實，再加上每人至少一變皮鞋，（穿套鞋的比較少，西婦都皮鞋外面冉加套鞋。）算起來車廂裏許多乘客，這一筆「禦雨」的工事費也就極叮觀了。</p>
<p>雨天的氣壓雖然低，但是生活上的必需支出反而高了起來！</p>
<h3>福祿壽</h3>
<p>— 阿田</p>
<p>偶然靠窗眺望，窗外即是馬路，　車隆隆來去不絕，想起目車價漲後，幾　無車不空，不禁感釗生活之艱難。但是人生來是賤胚，不消幾天後，覺得跑路　底是吃力的，於是又是無車不滿了、</p>
<p>電車上做着全祿牌香烟的廣告　記得中國自古以來，往往以「福綠壽」三全祝賀人的。大概「福」是指老年人的福氣，五代同堂，子孫滿屋就是福氣。小時候給祖父帶出去玩的時候，往往有人問祖父有多少孫子，祖父也得意地誇耀着，於是便得了人家「好福氣好福氣的同答，「綠」當然是指　貴榮華。而「壽」呢，有錢人家不要說是高年，即使是靑年，也要在大生日「做」下「壽」的。</p>
<p>寫到這裏便想起旣用「全祿」來做廣告，為什麼沒有仿傚，來一下「全福」，「全壽」呢？我以為福綠到在其次，而「壽」對於一個人實在是要緊的。多活幾年，多看一些世故，是人類最大的幸福。而老年人却歡喜被人尊為福氣，為了子孫，他情願犧牲自己一切。也有許多人只求溫鉋，過份的富貴榮華，他們並不奢求。但沒有全福「全壽」，却祇有「全綠」商標。</p>
<p>由此感到這艱苦時代的生活却給人更多的教訓。在現在，福綠壽三個字已完全聯繁起來了，而其中最重要却還是「祿」。你有錢，便是福氣，有錢仲養得活子孫，有錢便買得起補品，吃個白白胖胖增加大壽。但錢都鑽進少數的投機家和囤積家的袋裏，於是祖父們不再自引為福氣了，擔憂着怎樣來承當這一份家口，心裏希望着媳婦不要再生產孩子老人們住在兒子家裏，自己埋怨自己怎不早點上天，這樣時代白吃下輩的實在也有點歉然。更慘然的是有人出賣孩子，溺斃孩子，也聽到有人跑到警察局，說：「救救我吧，把我關在牢監裹吃口飯！」放棄了「壽」，因不能生活而自殺的史不在少數。</p>
<p>「祿」都變做衆矢之的了，老頭子，女人，小孩子也在打算着怎樣賺錢。但是賺錢要有本錢，結果她有錢人越有錢，無錢人越無錢。有人不敢憑空亨受「福」「壽」，「福綠壽」「全」都併到幾個人身上去了。</p>
<p>想到這裹，不禁然久之，無怪乎祇有）用「全祿」而「福」「壽」只不過是「祿」的附屬品吧了。</p>
<h3>新法幣與房租問題之一建議</h3>
<p>— 道頑</p>
<p>按舊法幣改為新法幣，應依二對一之比率計算，為不司爭之事。房東力面有增加成數夕議，則因捐稅水電費實際增加之故。按捐稅之增加，依法應由川租人負擔，不應轉嫁於房客。至於每度水電費率之增加，為價格（Price）之增，而非價值（Value）之增。民法四四二條規定得請增减（注意僅為「得」請增减而非、應增减）租金之要件為「不動產」（租賃物）「價值」之昇降，而非「租賃」「價格」之昇降：故據水軍　增率以為增成折合，變相加租之理由，實與民法四四二條不符。（價值就貨物本身而言，價格就貨幣數額而言。房屋之面積大小，設備優劣等，為價值之異；租金多少，為價格之異，價格不與價值成正比；價格增加，價值可以不變，或反减低。例如現在煤球價格遠較以前為高，而因原料缺乏，成色减　，其價值反而减低是。）至於捐稅水常費等因改用新幣而實際增加，致房東受影響時，似應視其利潤率為斷。按訓政時期約法第四十五條，有不動產使用之軍租應以法律禁止之明文：約法第八十四條，有法律與本約法抵觸無效之明文。至於房屋利潤率，超適百分之十五者為過分利得：超過百分之廿若，依民法二〇五條之法意，應視為重租；（該條為各種債之通則；房屋和賃亦為債務之一，利潤率為利率之一。）至於未約定之利率亦無法律可據者，依民法二〇三條應為百分之五。據此法律，倘房東方面之租率原為軍租，捐稅水　費等因改幣而實際增加之後仍為　租；（二房東之利潤率有高至百分之數百者）不但不應加租，且房客仍得請减租。倘因捐稅水雷費之增加　房結利潤率降至百分之廿以下，百分之五以上；則應不加不减，依原額折牛用新幣。付租倘利潤率降至百分之五以下，或竟至　本，則宜加至百分之五之利潤。又大二房東之利潤率相去懸殊，故有大房東力面應加租，而二房東方面，即就已加後之數額核算，仍不應加租，或仍得請减租者；不可一概以大房東增加折合率為二房東增加折率理由之烟幕。（二房東對於大房東之娑求，有原應拒絕者，可因圖籍詞加租而發生偏與妥協之弊，故大房東方面某折率或加租之實行，不成為二房東對於三房客應仿行之當然理由。）父大房東對於各二房東之契約，往往一律，而各三房客對於二房東之契約，則各各不同，其原利潤率亦各異　故攤派之法，僅在計算利潤率或　積時為普遍適用；在租金力而，則房東不應以多數房客之自願妥協，而對於依法拒絕之房客，以攤派為理由，以實不公允而美其名曰公允為名義上之烟幕。以上係對華籟民而言。至於不同國籟者問，共法律或異。非本建議範圍之所及。房東房客問訂有特約者，自願妥協者，亦皆當別論。（然自願妥協者之多，形成風氣，實大為據理力爭者無形之碍。）應見如此，是否有常？所引條文，是否如此適用？是否共他法規另有規定？請精於法律者教正之。（不受酬）</p>
<h3>寄宿生的膳食問題</h3>
<p>— 言明</p>
<p>暑假開始了，住在學校裏的寄宿生，都忙着回鄉去，據說下舉期他們皆不願再來上海讀書，家庭　對於他們求學的費用，實在難以負擔。</p>
<p>學費雜費書籍費雖　很大，但還可以勉強支持，宿費因為有一定的數目，也能應付，最感到困難　是一日三餐</p>
<p>一個最儉省的學生，每天早上，吃一頓最簡單的點心，也至少二塊錢，中午和晚上，最便宜的飯　，算是五元，這樣每天要　塊錢伙食，一個月就是二百元，一學期就是八百元。</p>
<p>寄宿生每學期　低限度須一千五百元，還是苦讀書，平日小　隨意多用一文，家庭方面旣難供給，如果申請助學金，决不會有這麽大的一筆錢。</p>
<p>以前，學校裏遠有廚房包飯，前幾個月因為買不到米，大多都停辦了　我以為學校當局，對於學生們的吃飯問題，必須多多注意，　好每個學校裏，都能够設立一個食堂，由學校當局向工部局申請食米，再骰法購買燃料，再僱用人燒飯，總之，一切事務，都由學校富局與學生們直接管理，不使有人從中營利，那麽學生們吃一頓飯，就可以經濟得多了。</p>
<p>希望學校當局們考慮一下，為寄宿的學生們减輕負擔</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（六）一彈指</p>
<p>葉二太太道：「明天你就去吧，早上去，看天黑上來了就回來。倘然光是陳小姐在家，不要住：倘然他哥哥也在家，你就看情形，他們留得殷勤，便住個一天兩天。」葉二太太的話，是很大方的，維城和翠珍聽了，都微笑着，倒像含有什麽神秘在裏邊。維城接着說道：「我說過的，和庫珍姊同去，翠珍姊怎麼樣？」舉珍毫不遲疑的回答道：「我不去。陳小姐和陳先生到道裏來，是兄妹，臉也長得一模一樣。我們雖說是姊弟，一個姓葉，一個姓卞，說與人家聽，人家也不信，給人家說閒話。城弟你上　橋去了，請陳小姐來道裏住，倒她挺好的。」葉二太太也贊成翠珍說的。維城想着，旣然翠珍姊避嫌疑，就不必勉強。吃完晚飯，是月初，沒有會麽月光，依舊坐在中庭納凉，螢火蟲閃着徵光，飛來飛去，牠不知道黑暗　坐着人，眞飛到　珍面前來。喜鵲拿了一把團屬追逐，沒撲着螢火蟲，倒是撲在翠珍肩膀上。維城道：「這又不會咬人，要你忙甚麽？」　珍道：「喜鵲眞還趁個小孩子脾氣，昨兒晚上，我看見她捉了好些個，放在一個蛋殼裹，把蛋殼掛在帳頂裹，說要當做一盞燈。我說，你要給少爺省油火錢，這幾惆錢，也不能做什麽。」維城道：「誰要她省錢，快把昨天晚上捉的放掉。白天打磕睡，晚上倒忙起道個來了。」葉二太太道：「喜鵲早跑了。現在，維城處處都是依規蹈矩，從前不是也捉螢火蟲嗎，他比喜鵲聰明，捉了來放在玻璃瓶子裹，把瓶塞旋得緊緊的，再放在養金魚的玻璃缸裏，哄黃龍，說是水晶燈。這些事情，部不記得了嗎？所以到了什麼年齡，做什麼事，勉強不得。女大當嫁，男大當婚，也趁一件事，年齡到了，不容人不提。」維城笑起來，　珍在黑暗裏溜去了；一時冷落了納凉的一幕。（一一五）</p>
<h3>畢業有感</h3>
<p>— 張火</p>
<p>從校長手裹接渦高中的畢業文憑，心裏感到說不出的難受。</p>
<p>許多　學在商議投考大學我連聽的膽氣都沒有，我知道自已是不配進大學的，慢說巨額的學費，就她和一般西裝革屐的同學厮混在一起的交際費，豈是所能負担的！</p>
<p>另外一些人在談就業間題，有人說：「現在找事眞不容易，許多工廠行家都在裁員减薪，只有做投機的銀號像雨後春　地開設，可是沒有門路是不能進去的。」就算有情而講了進去，那工作也是很難滕任的，像聽電話，打算盤，搶帽子這　事，我們又沒有學過。」這是另個、的補充。說來說去，總沒有一點結果，甚至有人拉起　畢業就是失業　的老調。</p>
<p>培根說：「教育的眞正的目的，是　社會訓練良好的公民。」。我以為我所受到的教育未免太不合實際。</p>

<h3>The Lake and Marsh Areas of Jiangxi Province: Japanese Troops Launch Major Offensive, Battle Engages North and South of Lixi, Yiyang Falls Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Nanchang, 29th, Central News Agency: A large-scale encirclement battle has now resumed in the lake and marsh areas of Jiangxi. Japanese troops are fiercely attacking the 20,000 men of the Chongqing Fourth Army. The battle situation up to 2:00 PM today is as follows: Japanese troops advancing from Fuzhou, after occupying the key point of Longgu, are advancing south along the Yihuang River. On the 29th, at dawn, they reoccupied the key point of Tanfang (8 kilometers southwest of Lixi). Japanese troops advancing from western Changjiang are fiercely attacking the 102nd Division, which is holding a position 70 kilometers from Jianchang. Japanese troops advancing towards the center in conjunction with the previous two units are engaged in fierce fighting with the 9th Division on the high ground 3 kilometers northwest of Lixi. Another unit is advancing towards Meifang, 6 kilometers south of Lixi.</p>
<p>Jiangxi Japanese Front, 28th, Domei News Agency: Japanese troops in Jiangxi launched an offensive against the four divisions of the Chongqing Fourth Army last Thursday at midnight. The fighting continued until daybreak on Saturday. The 102nd Division and the Provisional 1st Division are currently under heavy attack by the Japanese.

<h3>Remarks by Japanese Commander Itagaki: Recent Situation in Burma; Establishment of the Asia Youth League in Burma</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 28th, Domei News Agency: The Japanese military operations in Burma have come to an end. Lieutenant General Itagaki, Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army in Burma, met with a group of reporters here and stated that the fighting on the entire Burmese front has ended, and peace has been restored. When I returned here from ××, I witnessed the rural scenery along the railway and highway and was deeply gratified by the very good public order situation. The main reason for this is the soldiers fighting hard on the front lines, completely driving the enemy out of Burma, and the cooperation of Burmese talent, preventing the remaining enemies from carrying out guerrilla warfare. In the future, we will reorganize the central administrative institutions of Burma and strive to ensure that the Burmese people, liberated from the exploitation and oppression of the British, will forever enjoy happiness. The Burmese Independence Army is instilling the true intentions of Japan into the Burmese people and posing a significant threat to the British army. It was previously rumored that Burma was a malarial area, but the northeastern part of Burma has the same climate as Japan. In the future, we must have a clear understanding of this.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 27th, Domei News Agency: The Burmese Student Union (approximately 30,000 members) and the Youth Advancement Association (approximately 10,000 members) have now merged to form the Asia Youth League. The inaugural meeting was held in Rangoon on the 28th, and Mr. Ba Que was elected as the chairman. The League will also establish branches throughout Burma, bringing together enthusiastic young students dedicated to building a new Burma, and jointly carry out the following tasks: Establishing private schools; Publicly organizing lectures and discussions; Establishing libraries; Sending student representatives to Japan and other Axis countries for visits, or inviting student representatives from various countries to Burma for inspections; Dispatching League committee members to Japan to inspect the current state of the Japanese education sector.</p>
<h3>Former Governor of Burma Arrives in England</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 29th, Huitong News Agency: It has been learned here that Sir Reginald Dorman-Smith, the former British Governor of Burma, arrived in London on the 28th. It is reported that Sir Dorman-Smith will stay in England for a short period to discuss the situation in the Far East and India with the government.</p>
<h3>British Military Activities in India</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 28th, Central News Agency: Britain has abandoned its appeasement policy towards India and is now strengthening its military preparations to intimidate India and adopting repressive measures. As before, many members of the Bose faction have been arrested, and recently, the government has issued proclamations prohibiting gatherings and associations. The status of Britain's reinforcement of military preparations in India is as follows: Britain had previously established a plan to recruit 500,000 soldiers in India. The British government's garrison army is 60,000, the Indian regular army is 150,000, the British volunteer auxiliary army is 20,000, the Indian local army is 20,000, and the reserve army is 50,000. In addition, there are 60,000 troops from the princely states. The total number has recently been increased to 450,000. Its organization is divided into the expeditionary defense force, the border reserve force, the domestic security force, the coastal reserve force, and the general reserve force. British and Indian cavalry units are equipped with light tank units and motor vehicle regiments. Under the command of Major General Brooke-Popham, the air force has been actively expanding its airfields near Calcutta and conducting nightly exercises to intimidate the Indian people.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 28th, Central News Agency: Radio stations throughout India are currently broadcasting a British government announcement stating that it has decided to mobilize all doctors, nurses, and hospital staff in India to serve in the war zone. After all the plans implemented by the British authorities in India failed, Britain decided to abandon its appeasement policy and instead adopt coercive measures, forcing the Indian people to fight on the front lines. The current recruitment of medical personnel can be seen as a prelude to the mobilization of the Indian people.</p>
<h3>Indian Governor Orders Release of Communist Prisoners, Residences of Important Indian Figures Searched</h3>

The number of hospital beds will be increased from 20,000 to 100,000 within five years. The government will allocate 600 million yen to build many anti-tuberculosis hospitals in major cities. It is reported that in 1934, the number of people who died from tuberculosis in Japan was no less than 70,000.</p>
<h3>German Newspaper Examines the Evolution of American Strategy: Conflicting Opinions Between Offensive and Defensive Factions, Differing Interpretations on Opening New Battlefields</h3>
<p>Somewhere in Germany, 28th, Havas News Agency: A Munich magazine published an article today examining the evolution of American strategic concepts. The original text stated that recently, opinions in various circles in the United States on the war can be broadly divided into two factions. One faction advocates adopting a defensive posture, with military commentator Liddell Hart being one of them. The other faction believes in the doctrine of the late Admiral Mahan, which holds that it is necessary to obtain absolute naval supremacy. A recent book by Lieutenant Colonel Kernan of the U.S. Army, titled "Defense Cannot Win," was very popular and widely praised. In his book, Kernan stated that Gamelin, Gort, and Gamelin were completely controlled by Hitler before June 10, 1940, because Hitler could arbitrarily choose the location and time to launch an offensive. Conversely, General Foch believed that "operations must advance, and the most important thing is to have a strong army to defeat Germany on land."</p>
<p>Washington, 28th, Havas News Agency: President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill jointly assured the Soviet Union that the Allied nations would immediately open new battlefields. Regarding this matter, opinions among members of Congress vary. Some believe that it will soon be possible to open new battlefields, while others believe that the current troop levels and lack of military equipment will make the next six months the most critical period of the war. For example, Senator George holds this view, but emphatically states that this does not mean that the war will end in six months, and that the war will still be protracted. Senator Clark agrees with the views of Senator Ball of Minnesota, stating that in the next six months, the Allied nations can only conduct defensive warfare. In addition, Congress hopes to adopt various methods to reduce the alarming number of merchant ship losses. For example, Senator Ellender stated that with so many ships sinking and so many people drowning, it is not comforting to say that new ships can be built to make up for the losses, even if we occasionally think of those who died.</p>
<h3>American Warships Patrol the South Atlantic, Three More American Cargo Ships Sunk in the Atlantic</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 29th, Huitong News Agency: According to a report from Montevideo received by the Exchange Telegraph Company, the U.S. Navy has taken over the patrol duties in the South Atlantic and stated that Montevideo will serve as a military port and supply base for U.S. warships.</p>
<p>Washington, 28th, Havas News Agency: The Navy Department recently announced that three more American ships have sunk. The first was a medium-sized cargo ship that sank in the Gulf of Mexico on the 22nd of this month. All 33 crew members perished. After the incident, the authorities dispatched planes and warships to the scene for rescue, but only saw a wisp of black smoke slowly rising. The ship's name was still visible, and there was a lifeboat nearby, but there was no one in the boat. The ship did not have time to send out a distress signal when it was attacked, and the detailed circumstances of the sinking are unknown. The second and third ships were also medium-sized ships that were sunk by torpedoes in the Atlantic Ocean several weeks ago. The rescued crew members subsequently landed at a port in the eastern United States.</p>
<h3>Violent Earthquake in the Capital of Chile: Residents Awakened from Sleep, Running Barefoot and Naked to the Center of the Streets to Seek Shelter</h3>
<p>Capital of Chile, 29th, Havas News Agency: At 3:26 this morning, several violent earthquakes occurred here. Residents were greatly frightened and ran barefoot and naked to the center of the streets. The damage was great, but there were no casualties.</p>
<p>Capital of Chile, 29th, Huitong News Agency: An earthquake occurred here at 1:27 this morning, causing slight damage. The power and telephone lines on the north-south roads of the city were cut off, and the city was without lights for half an hour.</p>
<h3>The United States Establishes a New Air Transport Command: Commander George Takes Office and Delivers a Speech, Hawaiian Authorities Advise Residents to Evacuate</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th, Domei News Agency: According to the Asahi Shimbun, a special dispatch from the capital of Argentina states that the U.S. Department of the Army established an Air Transport Command on the 27th to complete the air transport organization. After taking office, Commander Major General George delivered a speech stating that the purpose of establishing the Air Transport Command is to ensure the smooth implementation of the United Nations' war plans around the world. According to well-informed sources in the capital of Argentina, the reason for the U.S. Army's establishment of the Air Transport Command is the special activity of submarines in the Atlantic Ocean, which has resulted in many military supplies being attacked by German submarines and buried at the bottom of the sea before they could be transported to their destinations. Furthermore, the Japanese army's occupation of the Burma Road has completely cut off the main supply route for the United Nations, so it is necessary to find a way to use aircraft for air transport in order to provide some relief.</p>
<p>Capital of Argentina, 28th, Domei News Agency: According to a report from Washington, U.S. military authorities in Hawaii issued another evacuation advisory to residents of the island on the 27th. The text reads as follows: The danger of Hawaii being attacked has not diminished at all. In view of the importance of Hawaii's defense, it is necessary for residents to continue to evacuate.</p>
<h3>Thai Economic Mission Departs Japan for Home</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th, Domei News Agency: The Thai economic mission, led by Minister Wanid of the Small Business Administration, which came to Japan to negotiate economic matters between Japan and Thailand, stayed in Japan for about three months. Now that its mission is completed, the group of five flew from Tokyo to Fukuoka by plane on the morning of the 29th and is scheduled to return home by plane on the 30th.</p>
<h3>Brazil Mistreats German Nationals: Germany Lodges Strong Protest, Threatens to Impose Retaliatory Measures</h3>
<p>Berlin, 29th, Huitong News Agency: The official newspaper here reported last night that if the persecution of German nationals in Brazil does not stop, Germany will take countermeasures against Brazil. Since Brazil severed diplomatic relations with Germany, anti-German actions within the country have escalated. Roosevelt has also sent personnel to Brazil to stir up anti-German sentiment among the Brazilian people, resulting in the persecution of German nationals. Brazilian Foreign Minister Aranha should bear full responsibility for such incidents. The Brazilian government has not taken immediate steps to suppress these unfortunate events, so the German government will take countermeasures.</p>
<p>Berlin, 29th, Huitong News Agency: Regarding the Brazilian government's abuse of German nationals, the German government issued the following communiqué: After Brazil severed diplomatic relations with Germany, the anti-German activities within the country intensified. Roosevelt's spies have now regarded Brazil as the most suitable place for their activities, constantly inciting ignorant mobs to commit acts of violence against German nationals and their property. Brazilian officials have even been willing to take orders from Washington. The person in charge of this is Aranha, the former Brazilian ambassador to the United States and the current Brazilian Foreign Minister. Personnel from German consulates and embassies have also been subjected to treatment that violates international law. For example, the German Vice Consul in Paranaguá, Mr. Brandt, was arrested by Brazilian police on the day of the severance of German-Brazilian relations and was imprisoned in a detention center, without being provided with food, as if he had committed heinous crimes. The next day, the police authorities informed him with a letter from the Federal Prosecutor General Ribas, stating that German consuls in Brazil no longer have the right to continue their business. Based on this letter, the authorities transferred Mr. Brandt to prison for months, treating him like an ordinary criminal. Before Brazil severed diplomatic relations with Germany, the Brazilian President had assured the German Ambassador that he would not mistreat German nationals. However, a large number of German nationals and those of German descent have been arrested. The U.S. Embassy in Brazil even submitted a list to the Brazilian government, instructing it to arrest those named and imprison them. The conditions in the prisons are extremely poor. The rooms are less than two square meters, and larger rooms are crowded with many people. The stench is nauseating. During interrogations, many black people were present to beat and torture them, and they were not allowed to sleep at night in order to force confessions. Mr. Daidai, the police chief of Rio de Janeiro, also admitted that some of the complaints about the poor treatment made by the detainees were valid. For over a hundred years, Germans have contributed greatly to the economic and cultural development of Brazil, and the Brazilian people have no animosity towards Germans. The terrorist measures taken by the Brazilian government under the influence of Washington are contrary to Brazilian public opinion. If the Brazilian government does not immediately stop these illegal acts, Germany will inevitably take retaliatory action.</p>
<h3>Argentine Ship Attack Incident Concluded: Argentina Satisfied with German Reply, Cabinet to Discuss Diplomacy</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 29th, Huitong News Agency: The Argentine Foreign Ministry announced yesterday that the Argentine government is satisfied with Germany's reply to Argentina's protest over the torpedo attack on the Argentine oil tanker Victoria. The matter is therefore concluded. Argentina has not requested compensation for the losses, as the losses will be covered by the insurance company.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 29th, Huitong News Agency: Argentine President Castillo is scheduled to convene a cabinet meeting next week to discuss Argentina's foreign and domestic policies. Political figures here stated that former President Justo was the first to congratulate Castillo after he took office as President.</p>

<h3>German and Italian Military Authorities Claim: Occupation of Mersa Matruh; Axis Forces Continue Eastward Advance; Britain Concentrates Air Force to Defend Egypt</h3>
<p>Rome, 29th, Allied News Agency: The Italian military headquarters announced today that Axis forces captured Mersa Matruh, 130 miles inside the Egyptian border, this morning.</p>
<p>Berlin, 29th, Transocean News Agency: According to German military authorities, Mersa Matruh, a British stronghold 200 kilometers from the Egyptian border, has been captured by Axis forces. German and Italian forces are continuing their eastward advance.</p>
<p>Rome, 29th, Transocean News Agency: The news of the fall of Mersa Matruh has caused rejoicing throughout Italy. The British news agency has already begun warning the people to prepare for the fall of Mersa Matruh, as supply has become a problem and the area is difficult to defend. This is because ships transporting supplies from Britain to the battlefield will not arrive until October. Although the sea route from Gibraltar through the Mediterranean is the fastest and shortest, it is very dangerous to take this route. As for the Axis forces, they can receive supplies directly from Italy. Rome believes that the excuses made by the British news agency are far-fetched, because Mersa Matruh is the terminus of a railway line with excellent railway facilities, and supplies can be transported from Alexandria. This line was only cut off twenty-four hours before the fall of the city. Italy does not agree with the British claim that it is easier for the Axis forces to receive supplies, because the German and Italian forces are deep inside enemy territory, their supply lines are lengthened, and the troops fighting in the desert are particularly dependent on rear supply.</p>
<p>Berlin, 29th, Transocean News Agency: According to German authorities, the German Air Force carried out large-scale operations in North Africa yesterday, pursuing retreating British forces and bombing military and transportation facilities. German planes attacked several British trains full of war equipment and troops in the Fuka area and east of Alexandria. Two troop trains and one train carrying vehicles were destroyed, and another train carrying war equipment caught fire and was damaged. Several sections of the coastal railway, which is extremely important to the British army, were hit and cut off. The stations along the line were also heavily attacked. British vehicle and tank convoys heading to the front line were attacked by German planes in low-level attacks, suffering heavy losses. The aircraft at the Ma'mura aerodrome suffered multiple bombing raids by German planes, and the planes and hangars on the ground were hit.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 29th, Allied News Agency: News from Cairo does not confirm the capture of Mersa Matruh announced by Rome and Berlin, only stating that the great battle in Africa took place fiercely yesterday in the desert south of Mersa Matruh, and that the Allied forces are doing their best to block the mechanized units of the German African Corps. The outcome of this battle may determine the fate of the Middle East and the Mediterranean. Cairo news also reported that on Saturday afternoon, the two armies used all their strength in a great desert battle, which lasted all night. The battle situation was even more intense yesterday morning. The German army is now 240 miles from its nearest base, Tobruk, but it is widely believed that this factor will not reduce its momentum of advance. The communiqué issued by Cairo did not provide detailed information about the fighting around Mersa Matruh, only mentioning encounters in the southeast and southwest of the area, indicating that the Axis forces have advanced quite far to the east. British news reported that the great battle in North Africa is still taking place within an area of ​​approximately 400 square miles with Mersa Matruh and El Hamza as its axes. British forces are clearly attempting to attack the German forces from every possible angle, but also acknowledge that this is a difficult task, as the Axis forces have enormous mechanized strength, including the German 15th and 21st Mechanized Divisions, the 19th Light Infantry Division, and three Italian divisions.</p>
<p>Berlin, 29th, Transocean News Agency: Berlin military circles believe that the rapid fall of Matruh is extremely important, as it has been learned that there are no other lines of defense from there to Alexandria. The British troops captured in Matruh are the remnants of the British Eighth Army that escaped from Tobruk. News reports that the British Ninth Army has rushed from Syria and Palestine to Egypt are not taken seriously by Berlin military circles, which believe that this group of British troops cannot arrive in a short period of time. The combat power of the so-called Nile Army must also be proven first. Much talk from the British side will absolutely not win the battle. This has been proven twice in North Africa.</p>
<p>Rome, 29th, Transocean News Agency: The Italian General Headquarters announced today that the city of Matruh was captured this morning. After the Axis mechanized units broke through British resistance southeast of the stronghold, they continued to advance eastward, capturing 6,000 enemy soldiers, seizing 18 tanks, and countless other military supplies. Two ships in the port were hit. In the air battle, 17 British planes were shot down.</p>
<p>North African Front, 28th, Havas Agency: The battle for Egypt has been unfolding near Mersa Matruh since last Saturday. The terrain of Mersa Matruh is strategically important, and battles are now taking place simultaneously on its southwest sides. The British defense line, known as the "Wavell Line," runs in a straight line from the Mediterranean coast to the Qattara Depression in the south, approximately fifty miles long. This defense line is still solid, but General Rommel, commander-in-chief of the German-Italian forces, is sending troops to attack from the south. His strategy seems to be to launch a large-scale encirclement of the British positions along the coast. According to reliable sources, the Axis forces operating south and west of Mersa Matruh include the German 15th and 21st Armored Divisions of the North African Army, two Italian armored divisions, and the entire light motorized unit. The fighting along the coast is still fifteen miles from the main British position. A sandstorm is currently raging there, making combat extremely difficult. However, the military authorities of both sides are well aware that the outcome of the Battle of Mersa Matruh is related to the survival of Egypt and the security of the Near East, and are therefore doing their best to engage. In terms of military strength and weaponry, the Axis forces, riding on the momentum of their victory in the Battle of Tobruk, certainly have the upper hand. However, their lines of communication are very long, and the soldiers must be exhausted after prolonged combat. On the British side, supplies must come from the Cape of Good Hope, a voyage of over 14,000 miles, which is their disadvantage. However, the troops have been reorganized and re-equipped. Now that they are deployed to the new defense line for combat, they are like fresh troops. Therefore, it is difficult to predict who will win.</p>
<p>Rome, 29th, Transocean News Agency: Official sources here announced yesterday that in the fighting in Egypt on the morning of June 26th, two Italian generals were killed in action: General Bakkeda Sal, commander of an Italian army corps, and General Bisenshai.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 28th, Havas Agency: Military expert Colonel Le Tellier recently published an article in the "Swiss Daily" comparing the current situation in North Africa with the situation in 1915, stating that in the autumn of 1915, the German-Turkish allied forces advanced from Libya, forcing the British army to abandon Sollum and Barrani and retreat to Mersa Matruh. However, by December of that year, after the British army received reinforcements, they drove the enemy forces to the border line in a few weeks. However, at that time, only small-scale units from both sides participated in the war, and motorized units and air forces were lacking, which was roughly similar to the situation in the winter of 1940-1941. At present, the Axis forces have obviously not lost their offensive power, and Mersa Matruh will soon be subjected to fierce attacks. Britain's only hope lies in preserving this stronghold.</p>
<p>London, 28th, Havas Agency: News from Egypt states that fierce fighting is taking place on the Egyptian border. The lightest British units, under the cover of artillery and motorized infantry, are continuously advancing to the front lines. The outcome of this battle may have a decisive impact on the evolution of the entire war, but it is still difficult to predict who will win at this time.</p>
<p>Milan, 29th, Transocean News Agency: According to sources here, the British Air Force in North Africa has reduced its activity since the fall of Tobruk due to recent heavy losses. The "Milan Evening Post" war correspondent claims that the British Air Force is now concentrating all its aircraft to defend Egypt, while simultaneously sending urgent messages to Iran, Iraq, and the Near East in an attempt to contain the advance of the Axis forces. Although the British Air Force is paying the highest price, it is still unable to achieve this goal. A squadron of British bombers, escorted by fighters, appeared west of Mersa Matruh and engaged in an air battle with Italian squadrons. Italian planes shot down seven enemy planes and drove away the remaining planes. Six British bombers attempted to attack Axis forces but were also attacked by Italian planes. Two British planes crashed behind the Italian lines, and four others were also heavily damaged. In another air battle, Italian fighter pilots outnumbered the British and shot down five British planes.</p>
<p>Alexandria Harbour Attacked by Air</p>
<p>Lisbon, 29th, Allied News Agency: According to news from Cairo, Alexandria, the British naval station in the eastern Mediterranean, was attacked by Axis planes this morning. The Egyptian Minister of Interior announced that the attacking Axis planes dropped several bombs, causing damage to the area. No details have been disclosed regarding the number of planes involved in the attack.</p>
<p>Ankara, 29th, Transocean News Agency: After the fall of Mersa Matruh, a British stronghold in Egypt, the British forces in Alexandria have prepared to destroy the various facilities in the port of Alexandria. British engineer teams are very busy in the port area. The public has withdrawn from Alexandria on a large scale. The delta of the Nile River is crowded with refugees. The desert road has been closed to refugees by the British army.</p>
<h3>Muslims Lean Towards the Axis; Britain Prepares Defenses; British Forces in Syria Concentrated in Haifa</h3>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 28th, Central News Agency: Under the fierce offensive of the Axis forces in North Africa, Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas requested the British commander in Egypt, Clayton, to have the British forces withdraw from Cairo. This attitude of the Egyptian government towards Britain is quite noteworthy. According to reports from the Basel News Agency correspondent in Budapest, the situation in Egypt has changed significantly due to the Arab and other Muslim nations expressing confidence in the Axis powers. The battlefield victories of the German and Italian armies have had an unusual impact on the Arabs and other regions. Therefore, the British forces in Palestine are now making efforts to restore defensive preparations and are quite fearful of the Arabs launching anti-British movements. Furthermore, the British Ninth Army stationed in Syria is now concentrating its main forces in Haifa. At the same time, railway use in Palestine has been restricted for military reasons. This can also be seen as a glimpse of the precautionary measures taken by Britain.</p>
<p>Budapest, Hungary, 28th, Havas Agency: The leader of the anti-British faction in Palestine, the Muslim Elder, Seyn, has returned to Berlin after visiting Rome. He recently told the Berlin correspondent of the "Hungarian Daily" that we are simultaneously fighting three enemies: Britain, the Jews, and Bolshevism. Anti-British movements in Arab territories have been rising one after another. In the most recent rebellion, thousands were killed and 40,000 were arrested. As for the Jews, we will never grant them privileges. I am also convinced that Germany will achieve final victory.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 28th, Central News Agency: As the situation in North Africa is about to be decided, the most noteworthy thing is Turkey's movements. Since Turkey is located between the Crimean Peninsula and the Egyptian front, the German-Italian allied forces' invasion of Egypt has had a subtle effect on Turkey's position. It is widely believed that the Turkish government will temporarily maintain neutrality, but it must express its final attitude. Turkey is currently purchasing large quantities of military supplies from the belligerent countries and is using 45 divisions to engage in defense. Recently, the United Nations, especially the United States, has made great efforts to ease Soviet-Turkish relations in an attempt to win over Turkey. However, Turkey recognizes the strength of the German forces on the Eastern Front, and the recent news of the disastrous British operations in North Africa has caused the pro-British sentiment in Turkey to decline, which will have a significant impact on Turkey's future decisions. According to news from the Turkish capital, Turkish Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Saracoglu have held multiple meetings recently. Well-informed sources believe that these meetings are related to the attitude taken by Turkey under the current situation. The movements of Turkey and the recent movements of various countries in West Asia are of concern to the world.</p>
<h3>British People Concerned About the Situation in Egypt; Public Opinion Unanimously Demands the Prime Minister Resign from Concurrent Posts</h3>
<p>Dublin, 29th, Havas Agency: The British newspapers today are all commenting on the situation in Egypt. The joint declaration of President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill has been relegated to a secondary position. Some newspapers regret that Churchill was not in the country when Libya was defeated, stating that Churchill's concurrent posts as Prime Minister and Minister of Defence are actually detrimental to military affairs. Military affairs value speed. For the present plan, Churchill should give up his concurrent post as Minister of Defence. At the same time, all newspapers unanimously demanded that the Prime Minister make an honest announcement to the House of Commons, saying that the Prime Minister's popularity has not wavered at all and that there is currently no one who can succeed him. However, his work is so heavy that he cannot make the concurrent post of Minister of Defence match his main post.</p>
<p>Topics Discussed at the Roosevelt-Churchill Meeting</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 12th, Reuters News Agency: The arguments published in London newspapers show that the topics of the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting were the issue of aid to the Soviet Union, the war in the Pacific, and the issue of ships. The joint British-American communiqué did not mention the issue of opening a second front. London regards this as avoiding the Axis powers from obtaining intelligence. US Senator Snyder declared before Churchill left the United States that the Allied forces would open a second front in Western Europe before winter. Londoners have already made a deep impression. At present, there are about 10,000 American troops in Britain and Northern Ireland. All parties are discussing plans for the US to assist in the invasion of the European continent. Political figures in London expect Churchill to deliver a broadcast speech before addressing the House of Commons. Churchill will announce to the House of Commons that reinforcements have arrived on the Egyptian front and will state that the positions in the Mediterranean are still firmly held.</p>
<p>British Military Tactics Urgently Need Improvement</p>
<p>Madrid, 29th, Transocean News Agency: The London correspondent of the "Yes" newspaper here states that the British Upper House will demand the establishment of a joint staff of the army, navy, and air force in response to the British army's performance in Libya. The "Times," which has always been very cautious in its tone, now openly supports this plan. The newspaper believes that there are two reasons for the British army's failure: lack of imagination and adherence to convention. It also states that the tanks and strategies used by the British army in Libya this time could have defeated General Rommel last year. Britain has so far failed to solve the problems of mechanized warfare and air force cooperation, resulting in repeated defeats. Therefore, British military tactics need to be improved.</p>
<h3>Gibraltar Fortress Air-Raided Twice in One Day; One Australian Warship Sunk in the Mediterranean</h3>
<p>Madrid, 29th, Tong News Agency: News from La Línea states that the British fortress of Gibraltar was bombed last night by planes of unknown nationality. The first air raid occurred at 00:49 midnight, and two more air raids occurred quickly at 02:15. Twelve bombs were dropped on Gibraltar's military airfield, destroying several planes parked on the ground. When foreign planes appeared over Gibraltar, British anti-aircraft guns immediately opened fire, but none hit. Fires broke out in the fortress area after being hit.</p>
<p>Madrid, 29th, Transocean News Agency: Fourteen merchant ships carrying military supplies and food arrived in Gibraltar on Sunday and are currently docked near three cruisers, six destroyers, and eight gunboats.</p>
<p>Melbourne, 29th, Havas Agency: Officials have announced that one Australian destroyer was sunk in an air battle in the Mediterranean on the 15th of this month. Out of 200 sailors, three were killed and one was injured.</p>
<p>Saigon, 29th, Transocean News Agency: The Allied Headquarters in Melbourne announced in its noon report today that the destroyer "Nestor" was attacked by German and Italian forces while escorting convoys in the Mediterranean on June 15th and has been sunk. The ship was the latest type of British destroyer and had only recently entered service.</p>
<h3>German Navy Weekly War Report</h3>
<p>Berlin, 29th, Transocean News Agency: Since the Axis forces won a major victory in North Africa, the Mediterranean has been controlled by the Axis powers. The participation of German light naval units in the attack on Tobruk is sufficient to show that the situation in the Mediterranean is very different from before. At that time, a German minesweeper team passed through the British water and power defenses of Tobruk and penetrated deep into the port. At the same time, German light naval units blockaded the port, and German heavy artillery on the high ground around Tobruk opened fire on British ships in the port, while planes also assisted in the air battle. Under the land, sea, and air siege by the enemy, there was no escape. It is estimated that one gunboat and five transport ships, a total of 2,000 tons, were sunk by German artillery fire. Since Tobruk, Bardia, Sollum, and other places were successively occupied by the Axis forces, the supplies for the German and Italian forces in North Africa have become much more convenient. On June 22, a team of British ships attempted to escape Tobruk Harbor and was intercepted by German motor torpedo boats. One cruiser, six coastal ships, and one 4,500-ton transport ship were sunk, and three coastal ships were captured. In the Atlantic Ocean, German submarines sank another 20 enemy ships, totaling 102,000 tons. Italian submarines also sank two enemy ships in the same area, totaling 14,550 tons. The convoy system has now been implemented on the east coast of the United States, but the US Secretary of the Navy has also expressed doubts about whether it can prevent the submarine threat, as he intends to propose building submarine cargo ships. Even if the construction of submarine cargo ships can become a reality, their capacity is limited and they cannot load a large amount of goods. The Japanese navy is also very active in the Pacific Ocean. Japanese submarines have even shelled the coast of Vancouver Island and Oregon, causing great shock to the enemy.</p>
<h3>Soviet Military Attaché to Turkey Takes Family Back to Country</h3>
<p>Istanbul, Turkey, 28th, Havas Agency: It has been learned that the Soviet military attaché to Turkey, Mr. Dai, has taken his wife and five family members of the Soviet embassy and consulate staff back to their country. Furthermore, it is generally believed here that the return of Soviet Ambassador to Turkey Vinogradov is for no more than two reasons: dissatisfaction with the criminal sentences imposed on two Soviet citizens in the Tullibahn case; and reporting to the government on Turkey's attitude toward the Battle of Sevastopol and the issue of refugees fleeing to Turkey when the port fell. Lord Halifax will return home for duty within a short period of time and will stay in London for about four weeks. The rumors about Mr. Halifax being recalled or resigning are not true.</p>
<h3>German Troops in Denmark and Norway Actively Making Military Preparations; Denmark Reinforces Naval and Air Forces; Norway Conducts Coastal Defense Exercises</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 28th, Havas News Agency: Recently, German troops have been engaging in preparations within Norway, and the Danish Minister of Justice also issued an order yesterday to take precautionary measures along the coast. In the past few weeks, Denmark has also been actively reinforcing its army and air force. All of these have been given extreme importance by general observers here. In addition, the German troops have recently conducted large-scale defense exercises on the Norwegian coast. It is speculated that the purpose is to test whether the local defense forces can resist enemy naval突attacks. In addition, the Norwegian military authorities have been constantly inspecting the state of preparation of the various forts in Oslo in the past few weeks. From this point of view, it can be seen that the area from the port of Narvik in Norway to the Danish coast is now in a state of alert. The German army has prepared everything to prevent the sudden landing of the Allied forces in the future.</p>
<h3>State of Siege Declared in Mexican Oil Region</h3>
<p>Mexico City, 28th, Havas Agency: Since the Tampico oil region was attacked by enemy submarines, a state of siege has been declared in the area. A curfew is in effect at night, and all types of motorcycles and vehicles are prohibited from driving on the highways near the oil region.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 29th, Transocean News Agency: According to news from Mexico City yesterday, two Mexican oil tankers, the "Tuxpan" and the "Chapaz," were lost on the 27th in the Gulf of Mexico, 50 miles from the Mexican coast. The above two ships were originally Italian oil tankers, which were confiscated by the Mexican government and then incorporated into the Mexican merchant fleet. Since this incident occurred, Mexico has taken preventive measures along the coast and implemented a curfew along the coast of Veracruz. The people were extremely agitated after hearing the news that submarines had begun to attack the Mexican coast. The military authorities believe that this will cause people to be even more terrified by such things as coastal cities prohibiting automobile traffic, closing entertainment venues, and troops巡inspecting city streets.</p>

<h3>Japanese Envoy Oshima Visits Germany to See His Father's Relics</h3>
<p>Stuttgart, Germany, 29th, Havas News Agency—Japanese envoy Oshima and his wife have been staying in Stuttgart for several days. Yesterday, they attended a grand reception at the Ludwigsburg City Hall. The ambassador visited the house where his father lived in 1892, when the ambassador was still a captain in the artillery. Later, he went to the barracks of the Württemberg artillery regiment, which his father had belonged to, for an inspection. Then, he drove to Marbach to visit the Schiller Museum and Schiller's birthplace. On Saturday night, the ambassador hosted a formal banquet at the Hotel Marquardt in Stuttgart, inviting representatives from the party, government, and military. He also visited the local branch of the German-Japanese Association to view the German exhibition, which displayed relics of the ambassador's father. The ambassador's father came to Germany in 1892 as a Japanese exchange officer and joined the Württemberg artillery regiment for practical training. At that time, the ambassador was only six years old. Later, the ambassador's father was promoted to lieutenant general and became a member of the House of Peers, so he ordered his son to learn German. The German-Japanese Association exhibition also displayed many photographs of the Russo-Japanese War and reports from German officers who participated in the war. The ambassador's father participated in the war and made remarkable contributions in the Battle of Shenyang.</p>

<p>Special Compilation on the Near East</p>
<h3>10. Kingdom of the Desert (1) - A Full View of Saudi Arabia</h3>
<p>The Beginning of the Story</p>
<p>Speaking of Arabia, at least this word has appeared in our minds many times. We don’t feel unfamiliar with such a foreign transliteration. In our daily life, when encountering bookkeeping and calculations, we always like to use Arabic numerals to write. We may not have a particularly good impression of such an ancient country, but unconsciously, we are in contact with some of its unique civilization. If you are not too forgetful, you should still remember that in that pleasant childhood that has passed, perhaps in that quiet dusk, you lay in a dark corner with a pure joy, holding a copy of "Arabian Nights" in your hand and reading it with relish. You were a little confused by the strange stories of that distant country. Those strange magic tricks and beautiful fairies filled your young heart, making you troubled for a long time. Your impression at that time was extremely vague. You simply didn't know what kind of mysterious place Arabia was.</p>
<p>Later, as you grew older and read more books, it is not difficult to see such descriptions in European and American novels: a child suddenly cried in the middle of the night, and the adults were annoyed but no matter what, persuasion was useless. Finally, a clever housewife came up with a solution. She whispered to the child, "The Arabs are here." This short sentence seemed to have infinite power, and the child stopped crying. In the eyes of a European or American, an Arab is a strange animal, like a wild beast running in the mountains, which can make a noisy child silent, and its name can also make a timid person tremble. You read such a narrative, and then an indelible and stubborn idea is imprinted in your mind: Arabs are monsters, beasts, ruthless robbers… You thought so when you were young, and you still think so when you grow up.</p>
<p>What kind of legendary and strange place is Arabia? This question is too general. The meaning contained in the word Arabia that we usually mention is too broad. We probably mean the entire peninsula. In this way, Iraq, Syria, etc. are all included. These have been described in the previous chapters. What we are talking about now only refers to a part of it called Saudi Arabia. Arabia is understandable to everyone, but adding the word "Saudi" makes it incomprehensible. In fact, the name Saudi Arabia only began to appear in the last ten years. In the early days, the entire territory of Arabia was ruled by Turkey until the last European war, when Turkey's power withdrew, and Iraq and other places also became independent one after another. When the war continued, the religious leader in Mecca, under the instigation of Britain, revolted against Turkey and established the Kingdom of Hejaz. Although it was nominally independent, it was actually just a puppet regime under the protection of Britain. But no matter what, at that time, it was quite aggressive and ambitious to annex various tribes. But at this time, a chieftain named Ibn Saud emerged in Najd. This man was a rare talent with both courage and wisdom. He first organized a brotherhood (Ikhwan), based on the Wahhabi nation (Wahhabites), and expanded outwards. Relying on his superior wisdom, he first defeated the neighboring small tribes. At that time, there were many Arab chieftains, each occupying one side and possessing military power, which was quite similar to our ancient feudal system. But most of them were a rabble. Once something happened, they fled in the wind. Ibn Saud didn't seem to spend much effort to clean them up one by one. In 1924, he destroyed Hejaz, and the following year, he occupied Jeddah, and from then on, his power expanded to the coast of the Red Sea. One year later, Asir was also occupied and designated as a protectorate. By this point, in 1932, Saudi Arabia was formally declared established. Although this emerging country has a short history, thanks to the vigorous management of the ruling party, its national fortune is thriving. A few years ago, it fought with Yemen. If it weren't for the great powers intervening, Yemen, such a small country, would probably not have been a match. It was fortunate that it was not destroyed. If it weren't for the outbreak of this war, with the emerging vigor of Saudi Arabia, it would not have been impossible to unify the entire Arabia!</p>
<p>Although there are nearly ten countries in the Arabian Peninsula, the independent countries include Iraq, the mandated territories include Syria and Palestine. The emirates include Yemen, Kuwait, and Oman. In addition, there are British Aden and Perim Island, and protectorates such as Hadhramaut. At first glance, it looks quite impressive, but due to the lack of ambition of the Arabs themselves, they have been ruled by foreign races for many years. In the past, they were oppressed by Turkey. After the First World War, although it was a good opportunity for national self-determination, it was easily missed again. Except for Saudi Arabia, which still maintains a trace of the dignity that an independent country should have, other countries, whether they are independent countries or emirates, are actually vassals of the great powers. This land was the birthplace of civilization in ancient times, and it was once prosperous for a while, and then it declined. But its rich treasures still make third parties jealous, so they fight for them, and it has long become a place where great powers compete for power. With the invasion of the torrent of this world war, the faces of many countries have changed. For example, Syria has been occupied by the British army, and the Iraqi government has been reorganized. So far, on the surface, Saudi Arabia still seems to be peaceful and has not been disturbed by the current war, but observing each other's actions in recent days, such as the increase of British and American troops in the Near East, and the deployment of German troops on the Egyptian border, etc., all indicate that a future storm has been lurking. Who can say that a large-scale desert war in Arabia in the future will not be as severe as that in Libya today?</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Terrain</p>
<p>The territory of Saudi Arabia includes most of the Arabian oxbow island, with an area of about 3.7 million square kilometers, but 99% of it (3.63 million square miles) is desert. It is not an exaggeration to call it the "Kingdom of the Desert". On this vast land, the percentage of the population is extraordinarily sparse, accounting for only one-eighth of the total area, that is, only 4.5 million people. In terms of area, it is half the size of Europe, but the population is not as large as a big city like London or New York. The situation is somewhat similar to our Xinjiang. If you weave a picture in your mind, you should be able to understand how desolate the hinterland of Arabia appears.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia borders Syria and Iraq in the northeast, the Mesopotamian lowlands in the northwest, the Persian Gulf in the east, the Arabian Sea to the south, and includes the entire Kingdom of Hejaz and Asir to the west, reaching the Red Sea, looking like a geometric trapezoid. The entire territory of Saudi Arabia is a plateau, with continuous mountain ranges, and the vast desert in the south is the location of the Rub' al Khali desert. In all respects, this area is no different from the Sahara Desert in Africa. The climate here is hot and dry. It is rare to get a few drops of rain throughout the year. It is also common for the temperature to fluctuate by dozens of degrees within a day. In the morning, there may still be a thick layer of snow on the ground, but as soon as the sun comes out, the dry and hot air current will exert its power. At noon, the flames of the sun are somersaulting up and down in the furnace. People are so hot that they can't breathe. Even if they can bear it, they are so tired that they always want to lie down there for a while. You thought that maybe a cool breeze would blow in the evening, but God never seems to give up joking with you. The sky is not yet dark, and then the wind really comes, but it is so cold, with dust and sand flying several feet high. Your eyes are blinded by the thick dust and sand. You lower your head, and the sharp north wind howls and roars in the air, which can lift the whole world together. Your neck is invaded by cold air currents everywhere. You look at the gradually darkening gray sky, and your heart is also soaked in ice. You really want to shout: "What a cold night!"</p>
<p>In the patrol-like air, our Arabs have grown up generation after generation. As soon as they set foot on the land, they tasted the taste of wind and sand. As they grow older, after continuous washing, they all become strong young men with burly bodies and slightly brown skin. People who grow up in this environment are naturally strong enough. From the time they have memories, they have been galloping in the wind and sand. Over time, they have all become skilled knights. Their bravery and valor can be compared with the Cossack cavalry. That's why people depict Arabs as a strange and terrifying creature, as if they were a genie with three heads and six arms.</p>
<p>In their homeland, everything is so barren and desolate. Farming? I'm afraid that even a blade of grass can't grow on the dry sand and rocks. Then let's graze livestock! But cows and pigs can't see a drop of water all year round. It would be a strange thing if they could survive. Therefore, they have to leave their homes and seek a way to survive. They can't just stay there and starve to death. For the sake of life, they drag their wandering feet around all year round. For a while, they may come to a place with water and grass, so they rest their legs, and some people build thatched huts and settle down permanently. This later development became the prototype of the earliest cities. Another group of people stay for a while, and then continue that long and endless journey. In the Middle Ages, Arabs were like a torrent, and their footprints could be found in every corner of the world. Some of them crossed the Red Sea and set foot on the African continent, while others traveled to India, Southeast Asia, and other places. Through the movement of this group of people, the early Arab culture also began to be spread far and wide. Just like the Arabic numerals we commonly use, weren't they brought out by this group of people?</p>

<h3>Food Rationing to be Implemented Next Week: Two Liters of Rice Per Person Per Week, Including Half a Liter of Broken Rice, Priced at Five Yuan, with Permission to Purchase Additional Flour to Supplement the Shortage. Due to the Warm and Humid Climate, Flour-Based Foods Temporarily Forgo Corn Flour.</h3>
<p>In order to regulate the food supply for Shanghai residents, the authorities of the two settlements have decided to implement food rationing. Designated rice shops will distribute rations. The International Settlement has designated 14 stores, and the French Concession has designated 243, for a total of 657. All rice shops distributing rations must enter into a sales contract with the authorities and will be assigned a tiger code by the authorities. At the same time, taxpayers within the settlements are instructed to obtain rice purchase certificates, which will be implemented starting from Monday, July 6th. Each person will be allowed to purchase one and a half liters of white rice and half a liter of broken rice per week, totaling two liters, priced at five yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>Price of Rice for Contracted Rice Shops</p>
<p>The Rice and Grain Office notified the contracted rice shops yesterday, stating: "Dear Sirs, according to the Bureau's food rationing plan, the number of bags of white rice and broken rice that your shop should send for the first time was notified in a letter dated the 20th of this month. It is now found that the selling price of white rice is set at 309.3 yuan per bag, and the price of broken rice is 292.8 yuan per bag. The payment must be fully paid to this office by July 2nd. The delivery order will be issued on the afternoon of the same day. Your shop must pick up the goods from the warehouse before July 4th. The above-mentioned rice must be sold starting from July 6th."</p>
<p>Two Liters of Rice Per Person Per Period</p>
<p>"When selling, you should rely on the first stub of the rice certificate issued by this bureau. The registration number of your shop is noted on the ticket. The person holding the stub will pay one stub and receive one and a half liters of white rice and half a liter of broken rice, totaling five yuan. For the above-mentioned quantity, your shop is allowed to sell to each person who comes with a stub at any time from July 6th to 11th. However, if the person delivers multiple stubs, rice can also be issued according to the number of tickets. A sample of the rice ticket will be issued to your shop together with the delivery order for reference. For the sake of your own interests, you should carefully study the sample of the rice ticket so as not to make mistakes when issuing rice. In the first week, rice will be issued based on the first stub, in the second week, rice will be issued based on the second stub, and so on."</p>
<p>White Rice and Broken Rice Matching Method</p>
<p>For this household rice, white rice and broken rice are matched in proportion. For those who can import 35 bags of household rice, 26 bags are white rice and 9 bags are broken rice. For those who import 50 bags, 37 bags are white rice and 13 bags are broken rice. For those who import 70 bags, 53 bags are white rice and 17 bags are broken rice. For those who import 80 bags, 64 bags are white rice and 21 bags are broken rice. The import price of white rice is 309.3 yuan per bag in national currency, and the price of broken rice is 292.8 yuan per bag in national currency.</p>
<p>Rice Shops Can Also Sell Flour</p>
<p>When the rice shops' trade association dispatched Lu Wenshao and Tong Fuyu the day before yesterday to meet with the Public Works Bureau, the managing director of Liki Foreign Firm, and the Japanese secretary for day-to-day affairs, it was heard that when each rice shop sells household rice, it will also sell flour. Approximately two catties of flour will be sold for every liter of rice purchased. If the number is small, it can be purchased at will, but it must not exceed two catties at most. It is estimated that for every 50 bags of rice received, 200 bags of flour must be taken.</p>
<p>Mutual Assistance and Adjustment Measures Agreed Upon</p>
<p>It is reported that the rice shops' trade association discussed measures the day before yesterday. The capital of fellow traders who take flour will inevitably increase, and they feel it is quite difficult to do their best. However, taking flour is the intention of the authorities to supply food to the people and should be accepted. Therefore, a "Mutual Assistance and Adjustment Method for Fellow Traders Selling Flour" was agreed upon, in which those with strength assist those without strength, so that the capital of fellow traders can be mutually assisted and adjusted to pay the flour payments, so that they will not feel difficult.</p>
<p>Corn Flour Discontinued for Flour-Based Foods</p>
<p>The Public Works Bureau has recently issued a notice stating that the previous notice requiring the use of 20% corn flour in bread baking has been canceled. At the same time, it is stipulated that from July 7th, the use of corn flour in bread and pancakes sold in the International Settlement should be discontinued. The reason for this order is that in the current wet and hot climate, food made with corn flour is prone to souring. Once the weather turns cool, the Bureau will issue another notice to resume the use of corn flour in the production and sale of bread and pancakes.</p>
<p>Last Retail Sale of Foreign Rice Today. Rice shops in the two settlements will sell the last retail rice this morning. Each person is still limited to purchasing one and a half liters, sold for 3.8 yuan in national currency. The sales method remains the same as before. However, the sale of broken rice will be discontinued on Thursday, July 2nd, and only broken corn will be sold for one day on the 3rd. Each person is limited to purchasing one and a half liters, sold for 2.2 yuan in national currency per liter.</p>

<p>Allied News Agency reported that, according to the exchange agreement between Japan and the United States, the American residents in China who will be exchanged with Japanese residents in the United States include the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Lockhart, diplomatic officials, clergy, managers of major commercial companies, and their families. A total of 636 American citizens, men and women, departed at 6:00 a.m. yesterday in the rain. They boarded small steamships from the Jianghai Customs Wharf and were transferred to the Dahe Wharf (also known as Qichang Zhan Wharf), where the Italian ship "Conte Verde" was waiting. The ship set sail at 1:00 p.m., scheduled to sail to Syonan (Singapore), to rendezvous with the Asama Maru, and then arrive at Lourenço Marques in the Mozambique Channel in South Africa to exchange personnel. The nationalities of the evacuated citizens are as follows: 549 Americans, 20 Canadians, 14 Mexicans, 13 Brazilians, 7 British, 5 Panamanians, and 28 others.</p>
<p>Buses Transported People to the Wharf</p>
<p>A total of 22 buses, specially hired or temporarily requisitioned by the Japanese Consulate, transported the evacuees from their residences to the wharf. Among them, 7 were French Concession red buses and 15 were China General Omnibus Company green buses. Twelve buses were dispatched at 5:00 a.m. from the Columbia Country Club at 201 Great Western Road. The remaining 6 buses, three and one respectively, departed from Hua Mao Apartments, the American School, and the International Hotel at 5:30 a.m., arriving at the New Customs Wharf between 5:40 a.m. and 6:15 a.m. The buses were connected end to end, similar to the scene at the end of November last year when the first batch of American troops were evacuated on double-decker buses to the wharf. Each evacuee carried two or three small pieces of luggage, while larger luggage was transported by Changfeng Company and the Japanese Annesho's card army.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the New Customs Wharf</p>
<p>The entire wharf scene was tinged with a sense of sadness due to the overcast sky. Among the evacuees were consuls from the United States, Brazil, Mexico, Guatemala, and other countries stationed in Shanghai, the Commercial Counselor of Canada in Shanghai, and diplomatic and consular personnel from Japanese-controlled areas in North and South China. There were personnel from the American Red Cross in Shanghai, newspaper and news agency reporters, church workers, and ordinary overseas businessmen. For identification purposes, ordinary overseas residents wore white ribbons on their lapels, while officials and their families wore red ribbons. Men, women, old and young, rode in the same cars and ships, but their expressions varied, some smiling, some sad. After getting off the buses, they entered the customs room in single file through the side door.</p>
<p>Four Ferries Carried Passengers to the Italian Ship</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, among the evacuees, there was one seriously ill person and one paralytic. Both were sent to the wharf by ambulances. The former was carried on a stretcher with one or two doctors accompanying, while the latter was pushed in a wheelchair and then transferred to a chair to be carried onto the ferry. The farewell crowd stood in rows outside the pier, not allowed to enter. Although separated by a road, they could not cross. However, after getting off the bus, the evacuees could linger outside for a moment to say goodbye to their relatives and loved ones. Some embraced and kissed, some shook hands endlessly, and some waved handkerchiefs from afar. Several flower baskets adorned the roadside. At that moment, farewells echoed. Between 6:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m., two ferries of the Japanese Mail Steamship Company, Jinling Maru, and Haihuan Maru, carried the evacuees to the Qichang Wharf in Pudong to board the Conte Verde. When the last ferry sounded its whistle, smoke billowed, and white waves surged. The farewell crowd outside the pier displayed unique emotions.</p>
<p>The Wind and Rain Accompany the Crowded Farewell</p>
<p>The morning light was dim, and the fog was thick, but the Jiangshui River was seen rolling. The Conte Verde, carrying the first batch of evacuees from the Allied countries, sailed through the waves. Yesterday morning, it was still raining, and a cold wind blew. More than 636 diplomatic and consular officials and ordinary overseas residents from the United States, Canada, and South American countries were transported by 22 specially hired buses from their residences to the New Customs Wharf, where they gathered. At 6 o'clock when the customs bell rang, the Bund was desolate, but the farewell crowd was crowded. The evacuees boarded the ferries in turn to transfer to the large ship. The whistle blew, and handkerchiefs fluttered. The Conte Verde departed from Qichang Wharf in Pudong at noon yesterday, heading directly to Magaski in East Africa.</p>
<p>Strict Security Along the Way</p>
<p>From 5:00 a.m., the area along Nanjing Road to the Bund on Edward Road was declared under temporary special martial law. Japanese military police stood guard fully armed, prohibiting pedestrians from approaching. The Public Works Department also dispatched a large number of Chinese, Western, and Japanese detectives to assist in maintaining traffic and order. The left side door of the customs inspection room was the entrance for evacuees. The gate was heavily guarded. Except for evacuees, no one was allowed to enter without special badges. The American Overseas Chinese Association and the Japanese Consulate General sent personnel to take care of matters at the wharf. They wore rose-shaped badges on their lapels, with a ribbon attached, which read "Member of the Overseas Chinese Association." In addition, a large number of customs officers were stationed in the inspection room and on the wharf to guide the evacuees' movements and manage their luggage. The situation was very tight.</p>
<p>Arriving in East Africa in Two Weeks</p>
<p>The Conte Verde set sail around 12:00 noon yesterday and will meet the Asama Maru, which is evacuating Japanese war refugees from Yokohama, overseas in Singapore. They will sail together to Lourenço Marques in East Africa. The entire journey will take about two weeks, arriving on the other shore approximately on July 11th. The two ships will carry a total of 1,500 American and Asian officials and civilians from the Far East. The exchange can only take place after the Gripsholm arrives there from New York and Rio de Janeiro on July 15th, carrying Japanese officials and civilians. The Conte Verde and Asama Maru will then carry the same number of Japanese officials and civilians obtained in the exchange back to Japan. When the Conte Verde set sail yesterday, one representative from the Swedish Embassy in Japan and one representative from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs accompanied the ship to supervise. Among the 636 evacuees, 155 were officials (131 Americans, 11 Brazilians, 6 Mexicans, 4 Canadians, and 3 Guatemalans), 419 were overseas residents from other places, 13 from Venezuela, and only 49 were residents from this port who were evacuated. After arriving in East Africa, they will be transported back to the United States by the Gripsholm.</p>
<p>Names and Positions of Evacuated Officials</p>
<p>Among the officials evacuated yesterday were U.S. Consul General in Shanghai Lockhart, Consul Pangg, Judge of the U.S. Court for China Helmick, Zhi Chang Stanger, Lowden, Collins, and Xue Lins, Assistant Commercial Counselor Kai Da, U.S. Consul in Tianjin, Butlerick, Consul Corps Secretary Mr. and Mrs. Lang and their beloved daughter Francis, Mexican Chargé d'Affaires in Shanghai Berliato, Mrs. Su Shi, wife of the Minister to China, and her four daughters, Canadian Commercial Counselor in Shanghai Du Lous, Mrs. Mai Han, wife of the Commercial Counselor in Hong Kong, Brazilian Consul in Kobe Olivier, Panamanian Consul in Manila Parsons, Guatemalan Consul in Shanghai Na Qiale, American Red Cross representative Anderson, Assistant Hanno, United Press reporter Jin En and Ford, Associated Press reporter White, New York Times reporter Roberson, and three children of Bai Lusi, the manager of the Shanghai English-language Great American Evening Post. The youngest evacuee was the daughter of the Guatemalan Consul Na Qiale, only two years old. The oldest was Miss Wilder, a 72-year-old missionary.</p>
<h3>The Situation of American Nationals Leaving Shanghai</h3>
<p>Over 600 American officials and civilians evacuated back to their country yesterday morning. In the wind and rain, they boarded four ferries from the New Customs Wharf to the Conte Verde mail ship, which set sail at noon. The left picture (top) shows the evacuees walking into the pier carrying suitcases and bags, and (bottom) shows the last ferry leaving the shore, with the well-wishers staring intently.</p>

Yesterday, Bai Mu Industrial Company initiated a group fundraising campaign led by Mr. Ye Chuanrong and Ms. Pei Li. It is said that the two gentlemen usually serve conscientiously and are highly trusted by their colleagues, so they were able to call upon the public, and everyone responded. In addition, Zhu Mu, Madam Xu, celebrated her 70th birthday and donated the congratulatory gifts from relatives and friends to this newspaper's scholarship fund. This act of kindness is highly admirable.

<h3>The Low-Pressure System Passed Over Shanghai and Went Out to Sea. Yesterday Was Windy and Rainy. The Water Level in the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River Rose. A High Tide Erupted Suddenly at 2:00 PM.</h3>
<p>Since the day before yesterday, the weather in this port has changed drastically, with wind and rain, and the temperature has dropped sharply. Yesterday morning, the rain was heavy and continuous, causing water to accumulate on the roads and form ditches. Starting at 2:00 p.m., a high tide suddenly erupted in the Pei River. The tide water emerged from the sewers and flooded the roads, merging with the accumulated water. The water was very deep on the roads, and low-lying areas became a vast expanse of water, turning into a swamp.</p>
<p>Low Pressure Exits to Sea</p>
<p>According to a Reuters reporter, the low-pressure system moving eastward from the Yangtze River basin has reached the vicinity of Shanghai, so the weather in this port is extremely bad, but it will soon go out to sea. According to news from the Customs Port Affairs Section, the river water in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, such as Hankou, Jiujiang, and Wuhu, has risen in recent days, especially in the waterways of Madang and Jiaoshan, where the water level is even higher. Therefore, the customs is considering setting up flood warning lights to facilitate navigation and protect the embankment.</p>
<p>Inconvenient Transportation</p>
<p>Since the high tide flooded the roads in the afternoon, traffic on each public road has been inconvenient. The trams in the French Concession were immediately temporarily suspended. Route 22 buses detoured through Avenue Joffre and Avenue Petain, barely managing to drive. The rain did not stop until the evening. The water accumulation was very deep in the areas of Route Massenet and Route Molière, and the west side of Fourth Road in the International Settlement was also difficult to walk.</p>
<p>Mid-section of Avenue Joffre flooded to mid-shin</p>
<h3>The Wang Jinxiu Murder Case: The Culprit Has Been Arrested. Jin Fugen, the young owner of Changxing Flower Shop, Was So Filled with Hatred That He Killed and Injured Two People.</h3>
<p>In the Wang Jinxiu Zhai gold and silver jewelry store at 521 Route de Zikawei in the French Concession, on the night before last (the 26th), a boy named Wang Mianwu, only five years old, and a girl named Qu Huide, sixteen years old, were sleeping in the attic room on the second floor. Wang was stabbed to death with a sharp blade, and Qu was injured by being hit with a rosewood stool. The details have already been reported in the previous newspaper.</p>
<p>The Young Owner of the Flower Shop Is the Real Murderer</p>
<p>The police attached great importance to this case and dispatched Inspector Gui Baoquan to conduct a strict investigation to arrest the culprit as soon as possible and bring him to justice. In recent days, Gui Baoquan led detectives Zhou Buguang, Wu Xiaopei, Yan Jinwen, Xing Shaoxian, Wang Xianyou, and others to track down the murderer. Yesterday, it was discovered that Jin Fugen (22 years old, from Pudong), the young owner of the Changxing Flower Shop at 519 on the same road, was the real culprit in the case. He was immediately arrested and taken to the police station for questioning.</p>
<p>Harboring Resentment for Erecting a Bamboo Shed</p>
<p>According to his confession, in February of last year, he erected a bamboo shed in front of his flower shop. Before long, Wang Wei, the owner of the neighboring Wang Jinxiu Zhai, reported it to the police, claiming that the bamboo shed was prone to fire, and was ordered to remove it and fined. Therefore, he harbored resentment and repeatedly wanted to harm him. Until the night before last (the 26th), at about 10 o'clock, he first borrowed a ladder from neighbor number one, but the ladder was short. Then, he borrowed a longer ladder from neighbor number four and placed it at the back door of Wang Jinxiu Zhai at 521, climbing up and digging open the glass window of the attic room to crawl into the room, intending to murder Wang Weiyuan. Who knew that Wang was not there?</p>
<p>Miss Qu Was Awakened and Injured While Calling for Help</p>
<p>The girl, Qu Huide, was awakened. They both knew each other. Huide thought that her adoptive father was traveling far away, and it was midnight, so Fugen came in through the window with indecent intentions. Therefore, she shouted for help. I ignored everything and immediately picked up the rosewood stool and hit her head once, causing her to faint on the spot and lose consciousness.</p>
<p>The Child, Wang, Was Stabbed to Death While Crying</p>
<p>At that time, the boy, Wang Mianwu, also woke up and cried non-stop after seeing the situation. I also hit his head with the rosewood stool. The crying became louder, so I took out a sharp blade and stabbed his head, face, waist, abdomen, and other parts several times, eventually causing him to die from serious injuries. Afterwards, I stole 300 yuan in cash from the writing desk drawer and left through the window. I directly admitted to injuring and killing the two children, both male and female. After a preliminary trial by the police, he was ordered to be detained for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Dance Hall Bloodshed: The Culprit Executed</h3>
<p>In the Shanghai Dance Hall opened by Tang Mingde at 440 Guangdong Road, a dispute arose on the 2nd of this month between dancers over a dance hostess, Shen Meiying. Instead of trying to resolve the conflict, the dance hall authorities, including inspector Xue Linlin, dance hostess manager Lou Minwei, and tea waiters Shao Amao and Zhao Jingen, beat the dancers indiscriminately with iron bars, resulting in the death of Chen Yunlai, who was beaten to death, and injuries to four others, including Lin Siqing, Sun Meitao, Zhou Xuanming, and Chen Shuwang. After learning about this, the old police station detectives Liu Jun and Chen Jun and Yin Mengfei went to arrest Xue and others separately. They were charged with the crime of causing death by injury, and the trial has been completed. Yesterday, the verdict was announced: Xue Linlin was sentenced to five years in prison, Lou Minwei was sentenced to ten months in prison, Shao Amao was sentenced to six months in prison, and Zhao Jingen was acquitted.</p>
<h3>Jianye Real Estate Company: Rent Collection Dispute Occurred</h3>
<p>The issue of currency system changes and conversion of houses has become a hot topic. The tenants of Jianye Lane, Bugaoguo Garden Fang, Wanyi Lane, Paris New Enclosure, and other buildings owned by the French Jianye Real Estate Company were previously notified by the company that, starting in May of this year, rents would be collected in banknotes converted at a rate of one to one. The tenants of each lane jointly sent a letter to the company, requesting a correction to the rent collection method, and also sent a special letter to the highest authorities in this port, complaining about their plight.</p>
<h3>Detective of the Dixwell Road Police Station Cracked a Blackmailing Dance Hall Criminal Case. The Two Criminals Committed Other Major Cases.</h3>
<p>Huang Siming, a Chinese detective from the Dixwell Road Police Station, arrested criminals Zhou Zhengming from Zhejiang and Zhu Qi from this area in room 16 of the Huxi Hotel on Great Western Road, and continued to arrest a woman, Li Zhang, in 19 Qianjia Lane, confiscating two pistols and seven bullets. They were taken to the police station. After a detailed investigation, it was discovered that Zhou and Zhu had repeatedly used false names to extort money from the manager of Xin Da Xin Dance Hall on Chuchiang Road, Lu Jin yuan, the manager of the MGM Dance Hall Chen Wei Xian and the manager of the Jinshan Dance Hall in Hankou Road Chu Ming, for amounts ranging from 50,000 to 150,000 yuan by sending intimidating letters in March and April of this year. However, Zhou, Zhu, and others have other major cases, which cannot be investigated in detail at this time, so they will be detained pending further investigation.</p>

<h3>Sports Briefs</h3>

<p>Business News</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Rise Today, Cooperative Sugar Stocks Follow</h3>
<p>The saying that sugar will increase in price has been detailed in previous newspapers and has been realized yesterday. Because everything is expensive now, daily expenditures have increased, and even the warehouse rent has risen with the military tickets. Therefore, distributors and retailers requested a price increase. The established price from February to May did not change much, which is equal to no increase. It was approved yesterday. Starting today, the price will increase by seven cents. For example, the retail price of fine white sugar will be 7 jiao and 8 fen per catty, and red sugar will be 7 jiao and 3 and a half fen. The allocation for retailers this month is 25,000 bags of evening sugar, and each deduction increases by 7 yuan in military tickets. The wholesale price of coarse white sugar is 79 yuan, 2 jiao, 8 fen in military tickets, and red sugar is 70 yuan, 0 jiao, 7 jiao, 8 fen. The rest can be deduced by analogy.</p>
<p>Due to the above reasons, the sugar stocks of the cooperative business office have tightened again in the market. Coarse sand stocks rose by 4 yuan in the morning, initially at 311 yuan and 5 jiao, then rose to 16 yuan. In the afternoon, it rose by another 2 yuan and 5 jiao to 318 yuan to 318 yuan and 5 jiao. Red sand was tight, initially rising by 7 yuan, then rising by 5 yuan, 305 yuan in the morning, and 310 yuan in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Public Debt Market is Relatively Stable: Short Covering Turns Prosperous, and Market Prices Rise</h3>
<p>The gray market for public debt was more stable yesterday. Amid various controls, public debt is almost incomparable to other commodities. However, before it is officially confirmed, people are still uneasy. Therefore, large investors retreated, and retail investors hesitated. As a result, yesterday's trading was greatly reduced. Sellers were rare, and short covering was slightly more. Market prices rose slightly due to short covering. Furthermore, Wednesday and Thursday are the bank closing period, and there are two days of holidays, so the inflow and outflow of general people suddenly decreased, and the trend may temporarily tend to be hovering. The entry and exit of the various businesses were quite lax. As a result of the market situation, except for Class A, which was slightly tired by one jiao, the rest all returned by 5 jiao to 8 jiao. The turnover was about 1.5 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<h3>New Pharmaceutical Stocks: Rising Even More Strongly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rise of Chinese stocks was even stronger. Since the recent decline has been too great, new investors are enthusiastically buying. New pharmaceutical stocks rose even more strongly. Cultural stocks and Chinese underwear stocks also rose in the buying spree. The stock market is recorded separately below:</p>
<h3>Electricity Priority: Investment Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign stocks were firm and weak. Jardine Spinning Mill was sold at 41 yuan and 5 jiao and 42 yuan successively. China Textile imitated 38 yuan. There were buyers later. Shun Ho Spinning Mill was sold at 36 yuan, and Woolen was sold at 16 yuan. The selling price of Woolen and Jardine Beers were slightly lower to 12 yuan and 8 jiao. There were buyers for Steel at 17 yuan and 2 jiao. Investors were active in Power Priority at 95 yuan. The rest had no price.</p>
<h3>Banning Speculative Trading: Cloth Industry Can Only Suspend Meetings Temporarily: Currently Applying for Explanation</h3>
<p>Due to the continuous rain yesterday, the transaction of factory cloth was even more quiet. There were very few people doing business, only dozens of packages of coarse and fine shilin cloth. Prices were firm. For example, 16-pound Flying Hong coarse cloth was 170 yuan, 12-pound Earth fine cloth was 158 yuan and 5 jiao, 12-pound Fugui fine cloth was 153 yuan and 5 jiao, and Peach Blossom Lady Shilin was 253 yuan. As for the transaction of factory cloth, it has always been a cash transaction, and there is absolutely no possibility of speculation. Summer is originally a slow season. At present, the market price has fallen below the price before May 28, which is sufficient to prove that the transfer of actual sales.</p>
<p>Regarding the cloth market in the east, due to the authorities' ban on speculative warehouse receipts and sales, even the transactions between businesses have always been cash in and cash out, and cannot be regarded as speculation. However, when shipping goods, a warehouse receipt must be held, which may cause misunderstanding. We are applying for an explanation, so we are temporarily suspending meetings. However, people in foreign firms and businesses still trade with each other. It is said that the new order for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth is as high as 91 yuan, returning to 188 yuan. The bank order for Dragon Head is 162 yuan. The color ball fine cloth is 168 yuan. The four gentlemen's serge red list is 7 yuan, 1 jiao, 2 fen. The bank list is 6 yuan and 5 jiao. The mountain is extremely scarce, because the wholesale price of fine cloth is above 200 yuan.</p>
<h3>Strict Price Limits on Woolen Fabrics: 66% Discount on Old Currency</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of strict price limits on woolen fabrics, the prices in the two concessions have been reduced in a row. The guild on Qipan Street instructed all businesses, large and small, to adjust and unify the marked prices from today, based on the old currency price of the major companies on Nanjing Road on the 27th and 28th of last month, discounted by 66%, and no secret price increases are allowed.</p>
<h3>To Suppress Prices: Grain Transactions Greatly Reduced</h3>
<p>The grain market was quite bleak yesterday. Before the plan to suppress prices was announced, everyone was in a wait-and-see attitude, and because the end of June was approaching, supply and demand were greatly reduced, and transactions were extremely rare. The unified market only sold 10 packages of Min Grain New Green Silkworm at a price of 158 yuan, 20 packages of Chongming Sand Red at a price of 172 yuan, and 1,000 pieces of Lizi Soybean Cake warehouse receipts for May at a price of 53 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<h3>No Changes in Call Loan Rates</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Bankers' Association's call loan rate was unchanged at 1 jiao and 6 fen. The discount rate for new exchange drafts remained flat. Military tickets remained between 5 yuan and 5 jiao and 5 jiao and a half.</p>
<h3>Xuzhou Daylily: New Products Coming Soon</h3>
<p>Xuzhou sent a quick letter yesterday stating that the daylily produced in this year's season is expected to be new soon. The water quality is very good, but the planters have switched to planting other things, and the output cannot be increased too much, so the price is difficult to look down on. As for the time of shipment, it is still difficult to predict.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Market Declines: Lingering Dampness Weakens Spirits</h3>
<p>The cigarette market is weakening. The momentum of British and American brands has stabilized, but the decline of Japanese and domestic cigarettes is difficult to reverse. Due to the continuous rain, people's spirits are further weakened, causing prices to plummet. British brands are at 8,100 yuan, Old Knife Brand at 5,200 yuan, Pin Hai Brand at 4,500 yuan, Wu Hua Brand at 3,500 yuan, and Fairy Brand at 3,750 yuan, with no significant fluctuation. Japanese Jinqiang Brand cigarettes were at 1,360 yuan, slightly recovering to 1,400 yuan later. Jin Dalou was at 20 yuan, Red Rose Brand at 1,300 yuan, and Compass Brand at 1,350 yuan, all falling by one or two hundred yuan. Domestic Golden Mouse Brand cigarettes were at 1,610 yuan, Beauty Brand at 3,200 yuan, and Pyramid Brand at 2,800 yuan, also falling by 50 to 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Match Prices Soar, Soap Prices Plunge</h3>
<p>The price of daily necessities such as matches sharply declined last week, but the market opened yesterday with an upward trend. Soap prices continue to fall, making it difficult to grasp the root cause, so prices uniformly dropped by about five yuan. Gu Ben soap is at 285 yuan, Bai Xiang Mao soap at 235 yuan, Huang Xiang Mao soap at 180 yuan, Arrow Knife soap at 245 yuan, Phoenix Brand at 3,100 yuan, Beauty Brand at 3,300 yuan, and miscellaneous brands at 2,300 yuan, up by four or five hundred yuan compared to the weekend. The rapid rise and fall make it impossible for dealers to predict. There is no significant change in the price of candles. White Lee's remains at 120 yuan, and Top Hat Brand at 115 yuan.</p>

<h3>Group Suicide</h3>
<p>— Ripples</p>
<p>The news of a family group suicide by jumping off the roof of a world building will not fade from people's minds; the news of a father forcing his family to commit suicide by poisoning their porridge is not easily forgotten. And now, there is another tragedy of a mother suffocating her entire family with a coal stove. Reading the newspaper to this point, I feel as if I am in a dream, lamenting the sadness of the human world!</p>
<p>From the group suicide by jumping off the roof of the World Building to now, whether it seems long, it has been five or six years; whether it seems short, it is only five or six years. If we look at these three heartbreaking events together, close our eyes and think, it seems as if everything is happening right before our eyes, which means we have only lived through a short period! But in this short period, the changes have been too great. So many unbearable tragedies have happened, and the sporadic deaths and corpses on the streets no longer attract people's attention.</p>
<p>However, it is not over yet, perhaps it is just the beginning. In the next short period, I am afraid that even more tragic news will be discovered. Thinking of this, what is the use of lamenting the state of the world!</p>
<p>Suicide is brave (please forgive me for not encouraging suicide, but I hope to use even greater courage to curb suicide). Society should bear this responsibility, and everyone should bear this responsibility. It depends on how we "do" it!</p>
<h3>In the Tram</h3>
<p>— Sha</p>
<p>Once it rains, everything seems to change. The weather these past few days hasn't been great, the sky is often overcast, as if it's about to rain. Yesterday morning, it finally rained, and it rained hard. This rainstorm is quite fierce. Food, clothing, housing, and transportation, none can be missed. When it rains, one still needs to eat, and to eat, one must move around. In rainy weather, the "transportation" aspect is the most difficult to solve.</p>
<p>If you hail a rickshaw as soon as you step out, without bargaining, and let the driver pull you, after paying the fare, the cost of rickshaws these days, compared to pre-war prices, after three months, you could buy a rickshaw that is half new. Rickshaws today are like Cloud Flying and Xiang Sheng automobiles five or six years ago. Unless absolutely necessary, and while one's legs can still move, ordinary people are probably reluctant to board.</p>
<p>So, the tram, although stable and fast, and the price is not very cheap, even if it is not raining, in the current Shanghai road traffic, it has the authority and has become a useful means of transport for the masses. Moreover, it is raining heavily, and those who usually ride bicycles have temporarily changed from two wheels to more wheels because of the heavy rain and strong wind.</p>
<p>Since the price increase of the tram, at first it seemed that there were fewer passengers, but after a few days, like the general rise in prices, during the time for going to and from offices, the carriages are still packed with people. On days when wind and rain are mixed, pedestrians are afraid to walk, and rickshaws are so expensive that people are afraid, so the tram has become a cheating means of transport. Look, many people, soaked with rain, squeeze onto the tram from the stop, dragging mud and water, which is annoying.</p>
<p>With great difficulty, one finds a seat, and the air pressure in the carriage feels particularly low. Looking around, it turns out that five out of ten windows are tightly closed. Raindrops hit the carriage windows, accumulating into lines, accumulating lines into a surface. You can't see the dots, you can't see the lines. The glass is like it had a bucket of water poured onto it. The outside is drenched, and the inside is filled with warm air, making the carriage windows a white fog, and you can't see the scenery on the road.</p>
<p>When the carriage arrives at a stop, groups of people get on. Fortunately, the entrance and exit of the first-class carriage are relatively clear, and the order is good. But there are still a few people who are in a hurry to get off the train, and they rush to the entrance, making it impossible for those who want to get in to enter, and impossible for those who want to get out to exit. The driver and the conductor are so anxious that they can't express themselves. Fortunately, everyone is anxious to get out or get in, and they just pretend not to hear, and few people pay attention. As a result, more people get on than get off. The distribution is " . "</p>
<p>Recently, I went with a friend to a foreign-owned store on Jing'an Temple Road and asked about the price of raincoats. The cheapest kind cost about 287 yuan, and the better ones cost 320 or more. Women's raincoats, a transparent, cicada-like type, were also overpriced. In addition, each person needed at least a pair of leather shoes (few people wear galoshes; Western women wear galoshes over their leather shoes). Calculating it all, many passengers in the carriage paid a considerable amount for "rain protection."</p>
<p>Although the air pressure on rainy days is low, the necessary expenses of life have increased!</p>
<h3>Fortune, Prosperity, Longevity</h3>
<p>— A Tian</p>
<p>Casually looking out the window, outside is the road, with cars rumbling back and forth. Thinking that after the tram price increase, almost every tram is empty, I can't help but feel the difficulty of life. But humans are born cheap, and after a few days, they feel that running is tiring after all, so again, the trams are full.</p>
<p>The tram has advertisements for Quanlu Brand cigarettes. I remember that since ancient times in China, people often used "Fortune, Prosperity, Longevity" to congratulate people. Generally, "Fortune" refers to the fortune of the elderly, with five generations living under one roof, and grandchildren filling the house, which is fortune. When I was taken out to play by my grandfather when I was a child, people would often ask my grandfather how many grandchildren he had, and my grandfather would proudly boast about it, and then he would get people's response, "Good fortune, good fortune." "Prosperity" of course refers to wealth and glory. As for "Longevity," rich people, not to mention the elderly, even young people, would "celebrate" their "longevity" on their big birthdays.</p>
<p>Writing this, I thought, since "Quanlu" is used for advertising, why not imitate it and create "Quanfu" and "Quanshou"? I think fortune and prosperity are secondary, while "longevity" is really important to a person. Living a few more years and seeing more of the world is the greatest happiness of mankind. But old people like to be respected as having fortune, and for the sake of their children and grandchildren, they are willing to sacrifice everything. There are also many people who only seek to be warm and well-fed, and they do not ask for excessive wealth and glory. But there is no "Quanfu" or "Quanshou," only the "Quanlu" trademark.</p>
<p>From this, I feel that life in this difficult era gives people more lessons. Nowadays, the three words fortune, prosperity, and longevity are completely linked together, and the most important one is still "prosperity." If you have money, you have fortune, you can afford to raise your children and grandchildren, and you can afford to buy supplements to eat, so you can grow fat and increase your longevity. But the money goes into the pockets of a few speculators and hoarders, so grandfathers no longer consider themselves fortunate, worrying about how to bear the burden of the family, hoping that their daughters-in-law will not have more children. Old people living in their sons' homes resent themselves for not going to heaven sooner, and they feel a little ashamed to be supported by the younger generation in this era. Even more tragic is that some people sell their children, drown their children, and some people are heard running to the police station, saying: "Save me, lock me in jail and give me a meal!" There are countless cases of people abandoning "longevity" and committing suicide because they cannot make a living.</p>
<p>"Prosperity" has become the target of public criticism, and old men, women, and children are also planning how to make money. But to make money, you need capital, so the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer. Some people do not dare to enjoy "fortune" and "longevity" for nothing. "Fortune, prosperity, and longevity" all go to a few people.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, I can't help but sigh for a long time. No wonder only "Quanlu" is used, and "fortune" and "longevity" are just appendages of "prosperity."</p>
<h3>A Suggestion on the New Legal Tender and Rent Issues</h3>
<p>— Dao Wan</p>
<p>Changing the old legal tender to the new legal tender should be calculated at a ratio of two to one, which should not be a matter of dispute. If the landlord attempts to increase the rent, it is because of the actual increase in taxes and utility fees. According to the law, the increase in taxes should be borne by the tenant, and should not be passed on to the tenant. As for the increase in the rate of each unit of electricity, it is an increase in price, not an increase in value. Article 442 of the Civil Code stipulates that the conditions for requesting an increase or decrease in rent (note that it is only a request, not a mandatory increase or decrease) are the rise or fall in the "value" of the "real estate" (leased object), not the rise or fall in the "price" of the "lease." Therefore, the reason for increasing the rent in disguise based on the increased rate of utilities is not in line with Article 442 of the Civil Code. (Value refers to the goods themselves, and price refers to the amount of currency. The size of the house, the quality of the equipment, etc., are differences in value; the amount of rent is a difference in price. Price is not directly proportional to value; price can increase, but value can remain unchanged or even decrease. For example, the price of coal balls is now much higher than before, but due to the lack of raw materials and the deterioration of the quality, its value has decreased instead.) As for the actual increase in taxes and utility fees due to the change to the new currency, which affects the landlord, it seems that the profit rate should be considered. According to Article 45 of the Provisional Constitution during the Period of Political Tutelage, there is an explicit provision that military rent for the use of real estate should be prohibited by law; Article 84 of the Provisional Constitution provides that laws that conflict with the Provisional Constitution are invalid. As for the profit rate of housing, more than 15% is considered excessive profit; more than 20% should be regarded as excessive rent according to the legal meaning of Article 205 of the Civil Code (this article is a general rule for various debts; housing rent is also a debt, and the profit rate is one of the interest rates). As for interest rates that are not agreed upon, and for which there is no legal basis, Article 203 of the Civil Code stipulates that it should be 5%. According to these laws, if the original rent rate of the landlord was a military rent, and the taxes and utility fees have actually increased due to the change of currency, it is still a military rent; (the profit rate of sub-landlords can be as high as several hundred percent) not only should the rent not be increased, but the tenant can still request a rent reduction. If the increase in taxes and utility fees causes the housing profit rate to fall below 20% but above 5%, then it should not be increased or decreased, and the old amount should be converted to the new currency. If the profit rate falls below 5%, or even results in a loss, then it should be increased to a profit of 5%. Also, the profit rates of major landlords and sub-landlords are very different, so in the case where major landlords should increase the rent, the sub-landlords should still not increase the rent after calculating the increased amount, or can still request a rent reduction; it should not be generally assumed that the increased conversion rate of the major landlord is the sub-landlord's excuse for increasing the conversion rate. (The sub-landlord may have originally rejected the demands of the major landlord, but may compromise in order to increase the rent, so the implementation of a certain conversion rate or rent increase by the major landlord does not become a natural reason for the sub-landlord to imitate it for the tenants.) The contracts between major landlords and sub-landlords are often the same, while the contracts between each tenant and the sub-landlord are different, and their original profit rates are also different, so the method of apportionment is only universally applicable in calculating the profit rate or arrears; in terms of rent, the landlord should not use the voluntary compromise of a majority of tenants to justify the apportionment for tenants who refuse to comply with the law, and use this injustice as a smoke screen under the name of fairness. The above is addressed to Chinese nationals. As for those of different nationalities, their laws may be different, which is beyond the scope of this suggestion. Contracts with special agreements between landlords and tenants, and voluntary compromises, should all be considered separately. (However, the large number of voluntary compromises creates a trend, which greatly hinders those who argue on legal grounds.) This is how it should be, is there any consensus? Are the cited articles applicable in this way? Are there other laws and regulations that stipulate otherwise? Please correct those who are proficient in the law. (Unpaid)</p>
<h3>The Problem of Boarders' Meals</h3>
<p>— Yan Ming</p>
<p>Summer vacation has begun, and the boarders living in the school are busy returning to their hometowns. It is said that they are unwilling to come to Shanghai to study next semester because their families find it too difficult to bear the cost of their education.</p>
<p>Tuition, miscellaneous fees, and book fees are very large, but they can still be barely supported. Boarding fees can also be coped with because they have a certain amount. The most difficult thing is the three meals a day.</p>
<p>For the most frugal student, eating the simplest snack in the morning costs at least two yuan, and the cheapest meals for lunch and dinner cost five yuan, so it costs ten yuan a day for food, two hundred yuan a month, and eight hundred yuan a semester.</p>
<p>The minimum requirement for a boarder per semester is 1,500 yuan, and they are still studying hard and will not spend any extra money at will. It is difficult for the family to provide this. If they apply for financial aid, they will not receive such a large amount of money.</p>
<p>In the past, there were kitchens in the school that provided meals, but most of them have been closed for the past few months because they could not buy rice. I think the school authorities must pay more attention to the students' eating problems, and it would be best if each school could set up a canteen, and the school authorities could apply to the Municipal Council for rice, and then purchase fuel, and then hire people to cook. In short, all affairs should be directly managed by the school authorities and the students, so that no one can profit from it, and then the students can eat a meal more economically.</p>
<p>I hope the school authorities will consider this and reduce the burden on the boarders.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Boat in Storm</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(6) In a Flash</p>
<p>Mrs. Ye said, "You should go tomorrow, go early in the morning, and come back when it gets dark. If only Miss Chen is at home, don't stay. If her brother is also at home, then you can see how things are. If they invite you warmly, then stay for a day or two." Mrs. Ye's words were very generous. Wei Cheng and Cui Zhen smiled when they heard this, as if there was something mysterious in it. Wei Cheng then said, "I said, go with Sister Cui Zhen, what do you think, Sister Cui Zhen?" Cui Zhen replied without hesitation, "I'm not going. Miss Chen and Mr. Chen are siblings to Dao Li, and their faces look exactly the same. Although we are said to be siblings, one is surnamed Ye and the other is surnamed Bian. People won't believe it if they hear about it, and they will gossip. If you, Brother Cheng, go to Zhouqiao and invite Miss Chen to stay in Dao Li, that would be pretty good." Mrs. Ye also agreed with what Cui Zhen said. Wei Cheng thought, since Sister Cui Zhen is avoiding suspicion, there is no need to force her. After dinner, it was the beginning of the month, there was no moonlight, and they still sat in the courtyard to cool off. Fireflies flickered with faint light, flying around, unaware that people were sitting in the darkness. A magpie took a bunch of fans and chased after them, but didn't catch the fireflies, but pounced on Cui Zhen's shoulder. Wei Cheng said, "These won't bite, what are you busy with?" Cui Zhen said, "This magpie is really like a child, last night, I saw her catch a lot of them and put them in an eggshell, and hung the eggshell on the top of the tent, saying she was going to use it as a lamp. I said, you want to save the young master some money for oil, but a few coins won't do much." Wei Cheng said, "Who wants her to save money, quickly let go of the ones you caught last night. You sleep during the day, and now you're busy at night." Mrs. Ye said, "The magpie ran away a long time ago. Now, Wei Cheng is doing everything according to the rules. Didn't you also catch fireflies before? He was smarter than the magpie. He caught them and put them in glass bottles, screwed the bottle caps tightly, and then put them in the glass tank where the goldfish were kept, to coax Huang Long, saying it was a crystal lamp. Don't you remember these things? So, at what age, you do what you should do, and you can't force it. When a girl grows up, she should marry, and when a man grows up, he should get married, that's the matter. When the age comes, people can't help but mention it." Wei Cheng laughed, and Cui Zhen slipped away in the darkness; the scene of cooling off was temporarily deserted. (115)</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Graduation</h3>
<p>— Zhang Huo</p>
<p>Receiving the high school diploma from the principal, I felt unspeakably sad in my heart.</p>
<p>Many classmates are discussing taking university entrance exams. I don't even have the courage to listen. I know that I am not worthy of entering a university. Not to mention the huge tuition fees, but also the social expenses of mingling with classmates in suits and leather shoes, which I cannot afford!</p>
<p>Some other people are talking about employment problems. Someone said, "It's really not easy to find a job now. Many factories and businesses are laying off employees and cutting salaries. Only speculative banks are opening like bamboo shoots after a rain, but you can't get in without connections." Even if you are lucky enough to get in, the job is still difficult to handle. Things like answering the phone, calculating accounts, and snatching hats, we haven't learned." This was another classmate's supplement. After talking for a long time, there was no result at all. Some people even brought up the old tune of "graduation is unemployment."</p>
<p>Bacon said: "The real purpose of education is to train good citizens for society." I think the education I have received is too unrealistic.</p>
