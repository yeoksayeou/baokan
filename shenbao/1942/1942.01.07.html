<p>哈瓦斯社五日柏林電　德意志通訊社頃發出消息稱、近日各方均認爲日蘇關係、不久即將發生重大變化、但德國政界人士、對於此項見解、並不苟同、據柏林一般人意見、認爲截至目下爲止、尚無可靠消息、足資證信日蘇兩國政治關係、行將發生變化云、</p>
<p>羅馬六日海通社電　此間負責政界人士評英外相艾登由蘇回國後之演說稱、默洲必須團結以對付蘇聯、因英國已決心犧牲全歐洲使受共黨荼毒、而使英帝國獲救、英國擊敗軸心國計劃、雖無實現之可能、但英蘇之協定、成爲歐洲各國之威脅、東綫蘇軍人數雖佔優勢、但其精銳已消滅、實不足慮、其捉襟見肘之窘狀日後將益暴露、以新近蘇軍之進攻義軍、雖以四比一之多數、均被擊退可爲明證、以遠東之軍事局勢言之、英軍之着着失敗、有如一農夫欲救其屋、但其穀倉及馬廄均已着火焚毀云、</p>

<h3>王世杰招待記者　發表重要談話</h3>
<p>重慶　中宣部王部長王世杰、六日在招待中外記者席上發表談話、要點如次、</p>
<p>二十六國聯合宣言</p>
<p>二十六個反侵略國家在華盛頓簽訂的聯合宣言、造成了一種空前的國際大結合、這種結合、眞合稱爲（神聖結合）、這個宣言不單確定了同盟國共同作戰的責任、並且確定了同盟國共同的和平計劃、因爲宣言已將所謂大西洋憲章納入其中、在上次世界大戰中間、英美法諸國對於和平目的、始終不曾成立任何成文的或確定的了解、即威爾遜總統的十四條款、亦只是威氏單方的表示、並未能拘束其他同盟國、這就是後來巴黎和會的一大癥結、此次羅邱兩公在極短時間內、使一切同盟國正式接受一個偉大的和平計劃、宏才卓識、實在令人欽佩、這個聯合宜言不僅促成作戰的勝利、並目可以保證和平的成功、中國政府認爲和平的成功、其軍要性至少與作戰勝利相等、</p>
<p>統一指揮迅赴事功</p>
<p>吾人對於關太平洋區域及中國區域各成立統帥部之決定、亦至感欣慰、上次世界大戰、差不多經過了四年的時間、同盟國始在西歐成立了一個統帥部、南太平洋作戰區城與中國作戰區域、（包括越泰等地）、實際上均較西歐當日戰區廣闊得多、今於太平洋大戰爆發後四星期內、均成立了統一指探的統帥部、實在是一件値得慶幸的事、倘非同盟國諸領袖間彼此有甚深的信任、當不能有此成就、</p>
<h3>陳策抵韶</h3>

<h3>蔣經國昇軍長</h3>
<p>東京六日海通社電　蔣介石將軍之長公子蔣經國少將、已被任命爲十九路軍長、前任軍長爲蔡廷錯將軍、</p>
<h3>北非德義軍　續自索倫敦撤退　堅守海爾發雅軸心軍遭英方空軍不斷轟炸</h3>
<p>倫敦六日路透社電　開羅昨夜發表公報稱、昨日北非里比亞區班加齊以南戰况、仍限於局部戰事、主要活動、集中於海爾發雅山隘、該處德義軍隊終日遭英空軍不斷猛炸、倫敦消息靈通人士批評義方所傳義軍已退出邊區索倫之訊稱、巴迪亞陷落後、義軍退出索倫一舉、乃當然之事、義軍退至海爾發雅山隘、較易扼守、班加齊以南奇達比亞四週之德軍、或正掘壕據守、昨夜德方公報宣布「里比亞無重大戰事」、義方公報則證實英方砲隊與空軍對邊區軸心軍陣地、大爲活動、據稱、空戰中射落英機兩架、又謂奇達比亞無要事可報、義方公報又述及德義大隊飛機進襲馬爾太島及英空軍轟炸西西里島之加斯德爾維特蘭諾城、開羅英軍司令部昨夜發表之公報如下、「奇達比亞區英軍流動縱隊與英空軍、續向敵軍、尤其是西面之敵軍交通、施加壓力、英軍又在馬迪亞俘獲敵兵五百名、巴迪亞旣已攻陷、英軍今仍轉移其注意力於被圍在西列內加東部之末支敵軍、扼守海爾發雅堅强陣地之軸心軍、遭英空軍不斷猛斷、</p>
<p>羅馬　日哈瓦斯電　此間軍事當局、頃評論過去數週之戰局、略謂、英軍在北菲之進展甚緩、紅軍雖因德義聯軍自動撤退、而獲有進展、但困難滋多、英蘇兩國所望之勝利、遙不可期、彼等顯已失去寳貴之時機、目下戰爭之趨勢、證明時間因素、對於英蘇兩國極端不利、英軍攻擊阿奇達比里之弛緩難進、更足充分證明敵軍之兵力已達衰竭地步、至於巴迪亞港之失陷、早在意料之中、况當地守軍已充分完成其使命質言之、即已克盡緩和敵方壓力之責任、而使軸心軍隊得以從容在後方建設新陣地、他如蘇聯前綫紅軍、雖集中大批兵力與軍實、並不時發動新的攻勢、截至目下爲止、其所獲成就、純因德軍自動撒至冬季陣地所致云、</p>
<h3>德義聯軍司令　患熱帶症　自里比亞返歐陸</h3>
<p>紐約六日哈瓦斯社電　據紐約泰晤士報瑞士京城專電稱、里比亞德義聯軍總司令羅美爾、因患熱帶病症、業已返往歐陸、</p>

<h3>今宵燈如畫</h3>
<p>— 金毅</p>
<p>古裝片曾經風行一時，據說並不是對古人的可歌可泣事蹟特表好感，而是海靑蟒袍才美麗奪目而已。如果此說非虛，現在摩登女子之重行喇叭袖旗袍，良有以也。所以汽車停駛以後，大家部想到馬車是尚，夕陽影裏，有女（易紅倌人而爲舞女）同車，到「飛特爾」吃吃咖啡，其風味當有勝於安凱第也。最近各娛樂塲限止十時打烊，節省電力，於是又想到了「燃燭狂歡」之舉，這又與宮殿之上「今宵燈如晝」的光景相彷彿；那些伏在肩頭上歌着「我愛今宵」的舞女向你媚笑的時候，或許也正如一頁劃階爲盤，以宮女爲子，貴妃笑而明皇樂的宮闈艷史也。而且自古以來，中國人對於燈有特殊的癖好：蠟炬銀臺，纓絡相映，上兀佳節，燈月爭輝。那些懷舊之家，在電燈泡外懸以宮紗之燈，亦就古氣盎然了。所以汽車停駛，限止電力，雖然在享受上减少了些興趣，但在善於追求興趣者是會想起古時候的什麼什麼來代替的，不過買米而排隊，排隊而飮彈（據說是手槍走火），却是並無先例的！</p>

<p>湘綺本來也是一個富於情感的人，經不起他們賢伉儷三番兩次的竭誠挽留，便祇得答應了；三四十天以後，裕華所派的一個夥計已從北平回來，給湘綺把所有的東西全收拾好運回，並且還帶給她好幾封熟人所寫的信。但不幸的是這些信裏頭，依舊看不到一些關於秋海棠父女倆的消息。</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops in Malaya to Launch Major Battle Within Days as They Advance Southward; Britain Determined to Defend Singapore at All Costs</h3>
<p>Malay, 6th (Allied News Agency dispatch) – Japanese troops are nearing completion of preparations for their assault on ××, the most important stronghold of Selangor in Malaya, considered the forward defensive position for Singapore. Using the water currents along the west coast of Malaya, Japanese forces continue their advance aboard boats, making a surprise breakthrough at the flank of the crucial ×× point at dawn on the 6th. Another Japanese unit advanced even faster on the morning of the 6th, breaking into the territory of Perak Selangor and pushing south. The Japanese have completed a half-moon encirclement of 50 kilometers, winding from the vicinity of the Strait of Malacca to the foothills near the central mountain range of Malaya at the ×× pass. It is reported that British General Commander Percival and Malayan Commander Major General Smith have gone to the front lines to supervise the battle. The biggest decisive battle is expected to unfold in the vicinity of the crucial ×× point.</p>
<p>Malay, 6th (Allied News Agency dispatch) – The situation on the Malayan front has intensified further since the Japanese troops broke into southern Malaya. The British army is exhausting all means for defense, making use of the unique terrain to construct fortifications, thoroughly destroying bridges, and burying landmines in various key passes to lure the Japanese troops deeper. However, the Japanese troops discerned the British defensive strategy and switched to using boats, launching surprise attacks along the coastline on the rear of the British forces. As a result, the British army can only rely on resisting in the area to fight the battle in southern Malaya. A three-dimensional battle is currently unfolding on land and sea.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Haito News Agency dispatch) – Well-informed sources here claim that after Japanese forces occupied Kuantan airfield last Saturday (the 3rd), the last line of defense for the British forces defending Singapore on the east coast of the Malayan Peninsula has lost its effectiveness.</p>
<p>London, 6th (Reuters) – A communiqué issued by military authorities here acknowledges that British troops have withdrawn from the Kuantan area. The airfield there, located 200 miles from Singapore, has been occupied by the Japanese.</p>
<p>Singapore, 6th (Reuters) – A communiqué issued here states that British troops on the Perak front have withdrawn slightly again to cope with the threat on the left flank. Johor and Singapore were bombed by Japanese aircraft yesterday, with minor damage.</p>
<p>Bangkok, 6th (Haito News Agency dispatch) – British troops south of Ipoh have retreated further. Japanese forces are not far from Selangor. The British in Singapore fear further Japanese landings on the west coast of the Malayan Peninsula because the Japanese have secured a base. If reinforced by a large army, they could break through the British front line between Ipoh and Kuala Lumpur and attack the rear of the British forces, which would be extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>Bangkok, 6th (Haito News Agency dispatch) – Singapore radio announced today that a large number of Japanese aircraft heavily bombed Singapore this morning. Details are not yet known.</p>
<p>Washington, 5th (Havas) – Political figures here recently stated that we must defend Singapore at all costs. We cannot delay further in strengthening the defenses of this fortress. If this fortress unfortunately falls, it will constitute a major catastrophe for all democratic nations. The balance of economic power will also be altered, benefiting the Japanese side, because the rubber, tin, and other tropical products produced by the Malayan Peninsula and the Dutch East Indies will no longer be available to Britain and the United States, and the various important raw materials that Japan needs urgently will have a source. Furthermore, from a military perspective, once Singapore falls, it will be very inconvenient for the democratic nations to recover the Far East in the future, and the British and American joint fleets will only be able to operate in secondary bases in Australia and India. However, it is believed that the Singapore fortress will be able to hold firm, forcing the attackers to wage a long siege. We must exhaust all methods to send a large number of British and American troops to reinforce it. Since the fall of Manila, the U.S. Far East Army, under the command of General MacArthur, has retreated to Corregidor Island to resist. The British and American governments have reached complete agreement on the defense of Singapore. The strategy of the American forces in the Philippines is to use various methods to restrain the Japanese forces and their tank corps as much as possible, so that they cannot be transferred from the Philippines to the Malayan Peninsula to attack Singapore.</p>
<h3>Wavell's Headquarters to Be Established in Surabaya; Dutch and Australians Discuss Joint Defense Plans; Australia Strengthens Air Defense Measures</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 6th (Haito News Agency dispatch) – According to official sources in London, the headquarters of General Wavell, the newly appointed Supreme Commander of the British and American Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific, will now be established in Surabaya. The rapid advance of Japanese forces in the Malayan Peninsula seems to have caused Wavell to abandon his original plan to establish his headquarters in Singapore. Surabaya is a seaport in the Dutch East Indies, located on the north coast of Java, with a population of 350,000.</p>
<p>Batavia, 6th (Havas) – Officials here announced today that the headquarters of the Allied Forces Supreme Command in the Southwest Pacific will be established in the Dutch East Indies. However, the exact address has not been disclosed.</p>
<p>London, 6th (Reuters) – It is said that the Supreme Command in the Southwest Pacific will be located in Surabaya, on the northern coast of the eastern end of Java. It has been transformed into an important military port in a very short period of time, comparable to Singapore. Torpedo boats, submarines, pursuit boats, patrol boats, and minesweepers are being manufactured in large quantities, and many have already been launched. Dry dock facilities have also been greatly expanded, and in the future, all types of ships except battleships can be accommodated. The beaches of the Dutch East Indies are very shallow and heavily mined, making it difficult for Japanese main force ships to approach.</p>
<p>Canberra, 6th (Reuters) – According to Prime Minister Curtin, Dutch Colonial Minister Mook is scheduled to arrive here today to discuss all relevant issues between the Dutch East Indies and Australia after the unified command in the Pacific. The Australian government welcomes Mook's visit and considers it a clear demonstration of close cooperation between the Dutch East Indies and Australia in the democratic bloc.</p>
<p>Bangkok, 6th (Haito News Agency dispatch) – In view of the recent heavy bombing of the Rabaul airfield in New Britain by Japanese aircraft on two occasions, the Australian government has strengthened air defense facilities throughout the country. Minister for Air Drakeford stated that in the future, some of the country's best pilots will serve in Australia instead of being sent abroad.</p>
<p>London, 5th (Havas) – According to a Reuters dispatch from Batavia, after the establishment of a unified command in the Southwest Pacific theater, people in the Dutch East Indies are wondering what positions Dutch East Indies Commander-in-Chief General Ter Poorten and Admiral Helfrich will hold. According to Dutch observers, the two may be appointed as advisors to the supreme command to assist in military affairs. General Ter Poorten has served in the Dutch East Indies for nearly 30 years, while Admiral Helfrich is a submarine warfare expert and has been responsible for commanding naval operations since the outbreak of the Pacific War. In addition, the Dutch East Indies Daily also commented on the Pacific War situation, stating briefly that the economic resources of the Philippines and Malaya should be regarded as temporarily lost. The Allied forces must provide effective assistance to protect the resources of rubber, oil, and tin in Sumatra and Borneo. If these resources are also occupied, the war may be prolonged for several years.</p>
<h3>North Borneo Oil Fields Ablaze; Flames Over Two Zhang High; Extinguished by Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Haito News Agency dispatch) – A reporter from the "Nichinichi Shimbun" stationed in North Borneo reported that when British troops withdrew from North Sarawak, they set fire to oil fields and oil wells. The fire was fierce, with flames from one oil well reaching 25 feet high. After the efforts of Japanese soldiers and workers, it took two weeks to completely extinguish the fire.</p>
<h3>U.S. Aircraft Supply Ship Damaged in Bombing; U.S. Intercepts Italian Ship</h3>
<p>Washington, 6th (Reuters) – The U.S. Navy Department announced yesterday afternoon that the U.S. aircraft repair and supply ship "Heron" withstood seven hours of Japanese aircraft bombing, being hit by one bomb and with three bombs landing beside the ship. Although the ship was damaged, it safely returned to a certain port. Admiral Hart, Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, has awarded the Navy Cross to Captain Kerber, and the rest of the personnel will also be commended, according to the Navy Department's order.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 6th (Haito News Agency dispatch) – The U.S. Navy Department announced last night that the Italian merchant ship "Marconi" has been intercepted by a U.S. warship in the Atlantic Ocean and taken to Cristobal Port in the Panama Canal. The ship has a displacement of 1,406 tons and is owned by the Genoa Meruso Company.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Attack Hawaii Using Special Powerful Explosives</h3>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Reuters) – According to a Tokyo dispatch, the Japanese Times reported yesterday that the British battleship "Prince of Wales" was sunk near the Malayan Peninsula previously due to the use of special powerful explosives. The same was largely true of the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. This type of special powerful explosive "can be manufactured without restriction in a short period of time."</p>
<h3>Soviet Union in a Special Position Regarding the Far East Situation; Pursuing an Independent Foreign Policy While Maintaining Original Relations with Japan</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 5th (Havas) – The "Neue Zürcher Zeitung" recently published a dispatch from its London correspondent stating, "The Soviet Union is in a special position regarding the Far East situation. This position should be recognized by both Britain and the United States. According to recent talks held separately in Moscow and London, the British and American governments are very grateful for the Soviet Union's great contribution to the struggle against Hitlerism. They also understand that if the Soviet Union wants to maintain the benefits it has gained in the past month of combat, it is necessary for the Soviet Union to concentrate its forces and continue to obtain British and American assistance. It is expected that Soviet industrial production will not return to the level of last spring until next spring. This means that Soviet industry is temporarily insufficient to meet the needs of the Red Army, which also means that the Soviet Union still needs to rely on the Allied powers for the supply of weapons and ammunition. Furthermore, after British Foreign Secretary Eden recently went to Moscow to hold talks with Soviet political leaders, he learned that the Soviet Union's greatest concern at present is its own problems. In other words, the Soviet Union is most concerned about the development of its national economy, because a large part of Soviet territory has been destroyed by the war. This problem is, of course, becoming increasingly acute. In short, according to the general impression gained by the British, although the Soviet Union will cooperate with Britain and the United States to achieve victory in the current war, it will still want to pursue an independent foreign policy in the future."</p>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Havas) – The German News Agency recently issued a message stating that recently, all parties have believed that a major change in Japanese-Soviet relations will occur soon. However, German political figures do not agree with this view. According to the general opinion in Berlin, it is believed that as of now, there is no reliable information to prove that the political relations between Japan and the Soviet Union are about to undergo a change.</p>
<p>Rome, 6th (Haito News Agency dispatch) – Responsible political figures here commented on the speech made by British Foreign Secretary Eden after returning from the Soviet Union, saying that Europe must unite to deal with the Soviet Union, because Britain has decided to sacrifice all of Europe to be poisoned by communism in order to save the British Empire. Although the British plan to defeat the Axis powers is unlikely to be realized, the British-Soviet agreement has become a threat to European countries. Although the number of Soviet troops on the Eastern Front is superior, their elite troops have been eliminated and are not worth worrying about. Their embarrassing situation will be further exposed in the future. This is evidenced by the recent attacks by Soviet troops on Italian troops, who were repelled despite being outnumbered by four to one. As far as the military situation in the Far East is concerned, the repeated failures of the British army are like a farmer trying to save his house, but his granary and stables have already caught fire and been destroyed.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt and Churchill Sign Agreement; Establishing an Armaments Allocation Committee</h3>
<p>Washington, 5th (Havas) – In addition to announcing the establishment of a joint fleet command for the Allied powers in the Atlantic, it has been learned that British Prime Minister Churchill and Roosevelt have signed an agreement to establish an Allied Armaments Allocation Committee.</p>
<h3>Wellington Koo Visits Eden</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 6th (Haito News Agency dispatch) – According to news from London, Chinese Ambassador to Britain Wellington Koo visited British Foreign Secretary Eden yesterday afternoon to discuss the war situation in the Far East.</p>
<h3>U.S. Congress Reconvenes to Discuss War Expenses; Totaling 5 Million Ten Thousand Dollars; Roosevelt to Deliver Speech</h3>
<p>Washington, 5th (Havas) – The Senate and House of Representatives reconvened today. The two most important bills on the agenda are: 1. Discussing the war expenses bill, totaling 5 million ten thousand U.S. dollars for purely combat purposes in the future. As for how to raise this huge sum of money, it is said that the initial method is to authorize the government authorities by the Senate and House of Representatives to levy new taxes of 2 million ten thousand U.S. dollars. 2. Establishing methods for controlling prices will also be submitted for discussion. Once passed by both houses, it will open a new record in American economic history, thereby becoming the most important law.</p>
<p>Washington, 5th (Havas) – President Roosevelt is scheduled to deliver a speech at the joint meeting of the Senate and House of Representatives at 5:30 tomorrow afternoon. According to congressional leaders who have met with the President, the President will submit the entire wartime budget bill on the 7th, totaling 5 million ten thousand U.S. dollars.</p>
<h3>President Roosevelt Orders Registration of All National Youths</h3>
<p>Washington, 5th (Havas) – President Roosevelt today signed an order stipulating that men aged 18 to 44 who have not yet registered for military service should immediately register with the competent authorities.</p>
<p>Washington, 5th (Havas) – After ordering the registration of all national youths, President Roosevelt has signed another order stipulating that personnel of foreign embassies and legations shall be exempt from military service, as shall foreign consuls and consulate personnel. Others who reside in the United States but are not American citizens, or do not wish to become American citizens, and certain types of residents to be announced, shall also be exempt from military service. According to current U.S. law, foreigners who have resided in the United States for two years can apply for initial resident certificates, and after five years, they can apply to become American citizens. Therefore, they have the obligation to register for military service. President Roosevelt's above order is to exempt the military service obligations of diplomatic personnel and other individuals from various countries.</p>
<h3>Wang Shijie Hosts Journalists and Delivers Important Speech</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Minister Wang Shijie of the Central Propaganda Department gave a speech at a reception for Chinese and foreign journalists on the 6th. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>The Declaration of the United Nations</p>
<p>The United Declaration signed in Washington by twenty-six anti-aggression countries has created an unprecedented international combination. This combination can truly be called a (Sacred Union). This declaration not only establishes the responsibility of the Allied nations to fight together, but also establishes the Allied nations' common peace plan, because the declaration has incorporated the so-called Atlantic Charter into it. During the last world war, the British, American, and French countries never established any written or definite understanding of peace goals. Even President Wilson's Fourteen Points were only Wilson's unilateral expression and could not bind other Allied nations. This was a major crux of the Paris Peace Conference later. This time, Roosevelt and Churchill formally enabled all Allied nations to accept a great peace plan in a very short period of time. Their great talent and vision are truly admirable. This United Declaration will not only promote the victory of combat, but can also guarantee the success of peace. The Chinese government believes that the success of peace is at least equal in importance to the victory of combat.</p>
<p>Unified Command Quickly Achieves Success</p>
<p>We are also very pleased with the decision to establish supreme commands in the Pacific region and the China region. In the last world war, it took almost four years for the Allied nations to establish a supreme command in Western Europe. The South Pacific war zone and the China war zone (including Vietnam and Thailand) are actually much larger than the war zone in Western Europe at that time. Now, unified command headquarters have been established in both areas within four weeks of the outbreak of the Pacific War, which is truly a fortunate thing. If there were not a deep trust between the leaders of the Allied nations, this achievement would not have been possible.</p>
<h3>Chen Ce Arrives in Shaoguan</h3>
<p>Shaoguan – Chen Ce and a group of British military officers arrived safely in Shaoguan on the afternoon of the 6th. (Dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<h3>Increased Fees for Visas and Passports for Foreigners Traveling Inland</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Regarding the fee collection methods for inland travel visas and passports for foreigners, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs originally stipulated a fee of one yuan in national currency for inland visas and two yuan for inland passports. Recently, in order to remedy the shortage, it has been learned that a new method has been revised. The actual fee for inland visas is six yuan in national currency, and the fee for inland passports has been changed to six yuan in national currency, which will be implemented from January 1 of this year. (Dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<h3>Chiang Ching-kuo Promoted to Army Commander</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Haito News Agency dispatch) – Major General Chiang Ching-kuo, the eldest son of General Chiang Kai-shek, has been appointed as the commander of the 19th Route Army. The previous commander was General Cai Tingkai.</p>
<h3>German and Italian Troops in North Africa Continue to Withdraw from Sollum; Defending Halfaya Pass; Axis Forces Constantly Bombed by British Air Force</h3>
<p>London, 6th (Reuters) – A communiqué issued in Cairo last night stated that the battle situation south of Benghazi in the Libyan region of North Africa yesterday was still limited to local battles. The main activity was concentrated in the Halfaya Pass, where German and Italian troops were constantly bombed by British air force throughout the day. Well-informed sources in London criticized the Italian report that the Italian army had withdrawn from the border area of Sollum, saying that the Italian army's withdrawal from Sollum after the fall of Bardia was a matter of course. The Italian army's retreat to the Halfaya Pass was easier to defend. The German troops around Qidabiya, south of Benghazi, may be digging trenches to defend. The German communiqué announced last night that "there were no major battles in Libya," while the Italian communiqué confirmed that British artillery and air force were very active against the Axis forces' positions in the border area. It was said that two British aircraft were shot down in the air battle, and that there was nothing important to report in Qidabiya. The Italian communiqué also mentioned that a large number of German and Italian aircraft attacked Malta and that the British air force bombed the city of Castelvetrano in Sicily. The communiqué issued by the British military headquarters in Cairo last night was as follows: "Mobile columns of British troops and the British air force in the Qidabiya area continue to exert pressure on the enemy troops, especially on the enemy's communications in the west. British troops also captured 500 enemy soldiers in Martubia. Now that Bardia has been captured, British troops are still shifting their attention to the enemy troops besieged in the eastern part of Cyrenaica. The Axis forces, who are defending the strong position of Halfaya Pass, are constantly bombed by the British air force."</p>
<p>Rome, 6th (Havas) – Military authorities here recently commented on the battle situation in the past few weeks, stating briefly that the British army's progress in North Africa has been very slow. Although the Red Army has made progress due to the German and Italian allied forces' automatic withdrawal, there are many difficulties. The victories hoped for by Britain and the Soviet Union are far from being realized. They have obviously lost valuable opportunities. The slow and difficult progress of the British army's attack on Agedabia is sufficient to prove that the enemy's forces have reached the point of exhaustion. As for the loss of the port of Bardia, it was expected long ago. Moreover, the local garrison has fully completed its mission. In other words, it has done its best to alleviate the enemy's pressure, so that the Axis forces can calmly build new positions in the rear. As for the Red Army on the Soviet front, although it has concentrated a large number of troops and military supplies and launched new offensives from time to time, so far, its achievements are purely due to the German army's automatic withdrawal to winter positions.</p>
<h3>Commander of German and Italian Allied Forces Suffering from Tropical Disease; Returns to Europe from Libya</h3>
<p>New York, 6th (Havas) – According to a New York Times special dispatch from Switzerland, Rommel, the commander of the German and Italian allied forces in Libya, has returned to Europe due to a tropical disease.</p>
<h3>Anti-Aggression Propaganda Committee Established in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 6th (dispatch) – The Anti-Aggression Nations Joint Propaganda Committee was established in Chongqing on the 6th, organized by representatives from the Central Propaganda Department and the British, American, and Dutch embassies in Chongqing. Other anti-aggression nations can also send representatives to participate. The task is to enhance the connection of propaganda work among the Allied nations. Similar organizations will also be established in Washington and London.</p>
<h3>Air Force Review Held in Tokyo; Tojo Says He is Not Afraid of Air Raids</h3>

<p>Berlin, 6th (Haitong News Agency) - German military experts made the following statement to a reporter from Haitong News Agency regarding the war situation: On the central sector of the Eastern Front, German forces continue to repel attacking enemy forces. In other sectors, only localized engagements occurred. The German Air Force is extremely active, heavily bombing enemy positions and shipping in the port of Feodosia. Two Soviet destroyers and one large merchant ship were hit.</p>
<p>London, 6th (Reuters) - Fierce fighting took place along the entire Eastern Front yesterday. In bitterly cold weather, Soviet forces continue to exert pressure on German lines. The midnight communiqué issued by Moscow stated only, "On the night of January 4th, Soviet forces engaged the enemy along the entire front." The communiqué issued by the Soviet side last night declared, "After fierce fighting and occupying several locations, Soviet forces continue to advance." Furthermore, according to an official announcement from the German High Command, "The enemy's repeated offensives in the central sector (Moscow region) have been repelled. In other sectors of the Eastern Front, there has only been localized activity. Large formations of German aircraft attacked Soviet positions in the Feodosia region of the Crimean Peninsula." Simultaneously, according to information received in London, Soviet forces in the Moscow region have advanced to within 25 miles of Mozhaisk (on the highway between Moscow and Smolensk). After recapturing Maloyaroslavets three days ago, Soviet forces retook the important town of Borovsk, 15 miles to the north, on Sunday. Borovsk is 25 miles southeast of Mozhaisk and is the town closest to Moscow that was occupied by German forces. As a result, the German positions in Mozhaisk are now under serious threat from both the north and south. Furthermore, news from Moscow quoting dispatches from the Red Star newspaper's Caucasus front correspondent reports that Soviet forces on the Crimean Peninsula have advanced 45 miles in the past two days, nearly driving the Germans out of the entire Kerch Peninsula. Regarding the situation on the Crimean Peninsula, the latest news received in London is that Soviet land forces in the Caucasus region have launched a major offensive from the Kerch Peninsula to relieve the besieged naval base of Sevastopol.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Foreign Rice to be Generally Sold Starting from the 10th; 250 Designated Rice Shops Responsible for Selling at Fair Prices to Meet Civilian Demand</h3>
<p>Over 300 Rice Shops Scheduled to Close on the Afternoon of the 9th</p>
<p>The Rice and Grain Management Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council, in view of the still insufficient general supply of foreign rice in the market and the considerable difficulty experienced by ordinary people in purchasing rice, after consultation with the Rice Shop Guild, has decided that starting from the 10th of this month, a portion of rice shops in the two concessions will be designated to be specifically responsible for retail sales. Within the International Settlement, there will be 250 rice shops designated to sell Shanghai Municipal Council foreign rice. Their names will be announced within days.</p>
<p>A Portion of Rice Shops Scheduled to Close</p>
<p>There are originally about 560 rice shops in the International Settlement. It is now decided that starting from [date], after designating 250 shops to be specifically responsible for supplying retail sales at all times, the amount of rice issued must be greatly increased in order to facilitate widespread retail. The calls from public opinion in recent days for improving fair price selling methods are now being implemented. Ordinary people can be spared the labor of trekking and the suffering of queuing and waiting. As for the remaining 300 or so rice shops, according to information obtained by the Datong News Agency from the Shanghai Municipal Council, it is stipulated that they must all close down at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 9th, and their business licenses will also be suspended from that time.</p>
<p>Five or Six Thousand Bags of Rice Released from Three Warehouses</p>
<p>According to inquiries made at the Rice and Grain Affairs Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the number of rice moving permits issued by the office to various rice shops yesterday was small, with the amount of rice released being only slightly more than 1,000 bags, designated to be collected from Chinese warehouses today. However, the Mao Tai, Roosevelt, and China warehouses were still open yesterday, releasing foreign rice for which moving permits had been issued the previous day for the various rice shops to handle retail sales, totaling about 5,000 to 6,000 bags. Those who received Shanghai Municipal Council foreign rice yesterday opened their doors for retail sales as usual. Due to the crowding of people, those at the back of the queue were still inevitably left empty-handed. As for the palm print method that the Rice and Grain Management Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council had previously planned to trial, it was abandoned after opposition from the Rice Shop Guild due to imperfections. The rice buying queues are still numbered using white powder, and order is maintained by police officers.</p>
<p>Record Amount of Flour Issued</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Flour Affairs Office yesterday issued a total of 5,545 [bags] of flour allocated to dough makers, sesame pancake and fried dough stick sellers, and retailers of pancakes, steamed buns, noodles, and bread. Of these, 4,967 bags were designated to be collected from the New No. 2 Factory and Fuxin No. 7 Factory, and 578 bags were designated to be collected from the Fu [missing character] Factory. The large quantity allocated has broken the record of the past half month, sufficient to meet the needs of various flour product merchants for one week to [missing character] days.</p>
<p>Product Price Limits Not to be Exceeded</p>
<p>Mr. Xie Liang, from the [missing character] office, told a Datong News Agency reporter that the office has stipulated retail prices for various flour products such as noodles, pancakes, steamed buns, fried dough sticks, sesame pancakes, and dough, which must not exceed the price limits. Flour product retailers who have not obtained flour can apply to the [missing character] for [missing character] distribution. For example, the flour allocated yesterday from the local factory was priced at 38 yuan per bag, so the cost of making food from it is very low. Furthermore, according to Mr. Xie, those who can apply to the office for flour allocation, such as biscuit merchants, are limited to making ordinary biscuits. The office refuses applications for fancy biscuits and filled biscuits, as the supply of this flour is to meet the food needs of the general public. Since the office began allocating flour in the middle of last month, it has distributed approximately 40,000 bags to date. The office sincerely hopes that the owners of flour retail stalls who have not organized trade associations can automatically go to the office to apply, and those who are unclear about the application procedures will be guided by the office. Mr. Xie was formerly a commercial assistant to the Australian government and is now responsible for issuing permits and allocating flour in the Flour Affairs Office, making many contributions to the policy of [missing character] distribution of food for the public.</p>

<p>Liu Shi, a 27-year-old woman from Ningbo, married Liu Guochu and resided with him at 10 Wen'anfang, Kezheer Road in the French Concession. They have a seven-year-old daughter, A Mao.

<p>The afternoon before yesterday, Vietnamese police officer No. 558 and other Chinese and Vietnamese police officers were maintaining order in front of the Hexing Rice Shop at 56 Xin Yong'an Street. Because they found it inconvenient to carry rifles while suppressing the crowd, they handed their firearms to Vietnamese police officer No. 549. However, because Vietnamese police officer No. 549 already had his own rifle in hand, he failed to properly catch the firearm handed over by Vietnamese police officer No. 558.

<h3>Rice Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market saw a sharp decrease in supply due to rain in the suburbs. Only about 40 bags of new rice arrived in the market, a decrease of 70-80% compared to previous days. Food retailers and shops shifted their focus to domestic rice due to the difficulty in buying foreign rice. Consequently, due to the imbalance between supply and demand, prices surged by 5-6 yuan to 10 [missing character] [missing character] or so. Northern japonica rice opened at 220 yuan and 214-5 yuan. Southern late-season rice opened at 200 yuan, with prices ranging from 202-3 yuan to 205 yuan. Early-season rice was priced at 200 yuan to 201-2 yuan. However, the sales of Yin Hua Yuan rice were not as active as in previous years due to price controls. The market stabilized, with prices opening at 212 yuan and 210 yuan. The total number of transactions was still close to 300 bags. There was no market for foreign rice, but its situation was also affected by the popularity of domestic rice. However, peddlers selling along the roads were active again in the afternoon, as peddlers from the countryside carried their goods into the city after the weather cleared. Therefore, the supply may continue to increase today. In the Hongkou district, whole bags of thin rice opened at 191 yuan, but could not cross the river to the south.</p>
<p>After a brief decline the day before yesterday, bran futures rebounded due to limited subsequent supply. The price of Zhenchang Lan Hua bran, which had previously opened at 54 yuan, rose sharply to 54.5-55 yuan yesterday, a rebound of one yuan. The price of bran from the Japanese Sanxin factory also rose, as there was little outflow from the market. The previous price of 56 yuan was no longer offered for sale, and the market is expected to improve further. Yesterday, only about 400 bags were traded.</p>
<h3>Edible Oil Also Under Unified Control; Soybean and Corn Transactions are Brisk</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the city's edible oil market became sluggish as the Military Distribution Office announced its unified control, prohibiting free buying and selling. Soybeans, being scarce, continued to show strength, and corn also saw a slight increase.

<h3>Huge Amount of Gold Pounds Arrives in Shanghai; Cash Reverses and Plummets; 1,400 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash market in Shanghai experienced a sudden reversal and decline. Prices successively broke through the 13,000 yuan and 12,000 yuan levels. Public confidence weakened after hearing that a large amount of Russian gold pounds had arrived in Shanghai to be melted into gold bars. Additionally, it was rumored that the gold price in Tianjin was prepared at 10,500 yuan, and that group was selling heavily, causing a surge in physical goods. From the morning's initial price of 13,100 yuan, which was already 100 yuan lower, the two gold firms, Qianzhuang banks, and Sheng Da Yong (Tianjin group) competed to sell. Many retail investors followed suit, causing the price to plummet rapidly by 1,450 yuan, reaching 11,650 yuan at 11:15 AM. At that time, a certain Qianzhuang bank entered the market with a limited price to buy, and the gold firms also repurchased, causing the price to rebound slightly. The closing price at 11:30 AM was 11,800 yuan, a small recovery of 1,400 yuan compared to the previous day's price. This was a correction after six consecutive days of gains, amounting to an increase of 3,700 yuan. The daily range was 1,450 yuan, with about 700-800 taels traded in half a day. The selling price of gold ornaments per tael at silverware stores, including Da Xin and its counterparts, was lowered three times, totaling 150 yuan, to 1,250 yuan (purchases reduced by 200 yuan). Silver remained at 16 yuan, with buyers in the black market at 12 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign currency market suddenly weakened. US dollar bills once retreated to 16.78 yuan, with the final price at 17 yuan, a decrease of 1.23 yuan from the previous day. Hong Kong dollar bills sharply fell to 2.89 yuan, and military scrip was at 3.785 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange bills and notes dropped to 3 yuan per thousand, or even broke even. The interest rate for interbank lending at the Money Trade Association remained at 6%.</p>
<h3>Profit-Taking Emerges; Yarn Prices Plunge After Rising</h3>
<p>The yarn market initially rose but then fell. This was due to profit-taking after several days of continuous gains. Simultaneously, the gold market also reversed and eased. This phenomenon was within expectations. The opening price for 20-count Shuangma factory yarn slightly increased by 30 yuan to 1,250 yuan, then dropped by 10 yuan. However, buying interest remained strong, and the market suddenly tightened, with shouts to enter the market and prices rising rapidly. It unexpectedly surged to 2,300 yuan. Unexpectedly, the rise was too steep, and profit-takers rushed to sell, causing the market to shift from high to low, gradually weakening to 1,165 yuan. However, the closing price was slightly better by 10 yuan, at 2,175 yuan. As for the Japanese yarn trade, it was even more prosperous, with prices first rising and then softening. 42-count Lanfeng was at 4,220 yuan to 80 yuan, 20-count Yueqin was at 2,470 yuan to 350 yuan, 20-count Shuangdiqiu was at 2,110 yuan to 20 yuan, and 20-count Tiannv was at 2,630 yuan to 80 yuan. Spot goods for Lvbao included 18-count Zhinv at 2,040 yuan, 16-count Feiji at 1,880 yuan, 16-count Jinta at 1,900 yuan, 10-count Hong Shuangma at 1,600 yuan, and 10-count Dabao at 1,500 yuan. Approximately 450 packages were traded in half a day. The market generally fell by about 10 yuan compared to the previous day. Currently, the yarn market is buoyed by the rumored doubling of the unified tax and the thriving spot trade in Japanese yarn, so confidence is boosted, and the market should stabilize.</p>
<p>The cotton situation is increasingly calm. Factories have a daily intention to purchase, so public confidence is stable.</p>
<h3>Increased Factory Unified Tax; Eastern Piece Goods Market Declines; Factory Cloth Spot Goods Scarce</h3>
<p>Factory cloth prices continued to rise yesterday due to active sales by local merchant groups and the large-scale sealing of spot goods, leading to a perceived shortage. 16-pound Huadie coarse cloth was priced at 108 yuan, Feihong at 87 yuan, 11-pound Sanmian coarse cloth at 75 yuan, 9-pound Wufu coarse cloth at 65 yuan, Fugui fine cloth at 86 yuan, and Dapeng at 87 yuan, all rising by 1.5 to 3 yuan compared to the previous day. Over 200 pieces were sold by local merchants. Although demand from the Yongdinghai group was good, the issuance of removal certificates was scarce and restricted. More than ten pieces of Dapeng Fugui fine cloth and other goods were purchased.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth prices fell yesterday due to the decline in cash and the increase in the factory unified tax. The evening closing price for 12-pound Longtou fine cloth factory orders was 89.75 yuan, a drop of 2 jiao and 2 yuan per piece. Caiqiu Feiyu Yanghe Laba were all sold at 86 yuan to 6.25 yuan. The opening price for the new Junzi Bijī order in the morning was 3.35 yuan, which dropped to 3.26 yuan. The market later rebounded to 3.28 or 9 yuan, but the situation softened again at the close, falling to 3.245 yuan, showing a revolving pattern.</p>
<h3>Public Bonds Rebound</h3>
<p>The over-the-counter market for public bonds is becoming increasingly firm, with a strong upward trend. Trading is also not weak. Type A opened at 62 yuan, and Type C opened at 58 yuan. After entering the market, Tongkang suddenly had demand, and Tongyi also absorbed some. Type A rose to 63 yuan to 3.3 yuan, and Type C gradually rose from 58.2 yuan, with the highest price at 60.3 yuan. Type B was priced at 60.05 yuan, Type D at 55 yuan to 56 yuan, and Type E rose from 56.5 yuan to 58.2 yuan. All types of market prices rose, with Type C being the strongest, while the others felt incomparable. The fifth installment of the 10th period red interest coupon, which should have been received by the end of November last year, has not yet been received. It is said that it has been suspended and will wait for further instructions. However, the bond market has risen sharply by 2-3 yuan, and it is unknown what its effect will be. The over-the-counter market is too small, making it easy to manipulate, which is also a major reason.</p>
<p>The stock prices outside the Zhongye Public Office are still inconsistent. Jardine Matheson was at 60 yuan, Ewo Cotton Mill at 278 yuan, Kenchih at 21.5 yuan, Asia Dock at 10 yuan, Yeguang at 14 yuan, Zhongfang at 9.25 yuan, Zhive at 6.25 yuan, and Langgezhi at slightly above 20 yuan. No other prices were available.</p>
<h3>Sugar Merchants Cooperate in Business</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office was established on the 4th of this month to closely cooperate with the military distribution association to complete the distribution of sugar. Anyone holding sugar stocks participating in the public sale is a shareholder, with each piece of sugar being counted as one share (small packages of sugar not exceeding 30 kilograms are generally counted as three pieces as one share), and is not bound by the Company Law and the Cooperative Law. It is divided into six groups: coarse granulated sugar group, white sugar group, raw sugar group, brown sugar group, green sugar group, and rock sugar group. Participants in the public sale must first submit 20% of the warehouse receipt for the number of sugars registered. If the number to be submitted is less than 50 packages, each package will be delivered at a price of 80 yuan. This 20% will be used as capital for public sale. The publicly sold sugar is pooled together, and the proceeds from each group are distributed jointly according to the number of shares in that group, regardless of the origin of the goods. However, the distribution will only take place when the number of pieces sold by the group reaches one-tenth of the total. If it is less than one-tenth, the funds will be kept by the office and added to the next distribution when it reaches one-tenth. If the sugar in any group is damaged in part or in whole, regardless of who owns the goods, it will be jointly recognized according to the number of shares in that group. All transactions of sugar firms must use military scrip for payment. Sugar firms reselling to other merchants should also try to use military scrip within the possible scope, and stipulate payment before delivery. The Zhengjin Bank is used as the correspondent bank, and military scrip and legal tender accounts are opened, with the signatures of three managing directors required. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Tonight, the Lamps are Like Paintings</h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>Costume dramas were once popular. It is said that it was not because of a special appreciation for the admirable deeds of the ancients, but because the dark green python robes were so beautiful and eye-catching. If this saying is true, then the modern women's re-emergence of bell-sleeved cheongsams is well-founded. Therefore, after the cars stopped running, everyone thought of horse-drawn carriages as being fashionable. In the shadows of the setting sun, a woman (replacing the red-light district courtesan with a dancer) rides in a carriage to "Fittle" to drink coffee, the flavor of which must be better than Ankaydi. Recently, entertainment venues have been limited to closing at 10 o'clock to save electricity, so people have also thought of the "candlelight revelry" act, which is similar to the palace scene of "tonight the lamps are like daylight"; when those dancers leaning on your shoulders and singing "I love tonight" smile coquettishly at you, perhaps it is also like a page of scandalous palace history where servants are used as chess pieces and concubines laugh while the emperor is amused. Moreover, since ancient times, the Chinese have had a special fondness for lamps: candlelight on silver stands, tassels reflecting each other, on the festive days, lamps and the moon compete for brilliance. Those nostalgic families who hang palace gauze lanterns outside electric light bulbs are also filled with ancient charm. Therefore, although the suspension of cars and the limitation of electricity have reduced some enjoyment, those who are good at pursuing interest will think of something from ancient times to replace it. However, queuing to buy rice and being shot while queuing (said to be a accidental shooting), are unprecedented!</p>
<h3>New</h3>
<p>— Dong</p>
<p>Old clothes are renovated, but the clothes are still old. Old wine is put into new bottles, but the wine is still old. An old house is painted once or twice, a layer of white powder is applied, and it is called a new house again.</p>
<p>But the newness we need is true newness, creative newness.</p>
<h3>Zhang Yi's Letter from Hong Kong</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>Standing under lead-like clouds, looking out at the artists on the South Sea Islands, only the cold wind brings waves of loneliness and emptiness; the longing in my heart only stirs up melancholy emotions.</p>
<p>Those who remain in this metropolis without New Year's lanterns are all silently praying:</p>
<p>——May they continue to be active,</p>
<p>And I, remembering the friends who left in a hurry, often read the last letter he sent from Hong Kong: When I saw your first letter on the evening of November 14th, it was like meeting each other, simple and speechless. The brother also has this writing problem, so Fei Xiong (Note: Fei Mu) has not yet sent a letter there. Regarding the absurd history of the Thirteen Points Jesus, I can only express tolerance and discuss it when I return. Wu Yonggang will not be able to return to Shanghai this year because he has been hired by the Nanyang Company and is currently writing a play. But Du Yu's abandonment of the industry for the automobile business is not bad. Lulu and Jiang Junchao are directing and starring in "Song of the Earth," with Wang Renmei as the female lead. All the location shots have been completed, and the interior shots are being borrowed from the National Photography Studio. In short, the living conditions in Hong Kong are all good, without any of the troubles of Shanghai. Yes, Yu Ling is working on writing and performing. We are now living on the third floor of No. 7 Fulao Village Road, Kowloon City. The sub-landlord is a Hong Kong Miss Deng, but her life is not romantic, and she is quite interested in literature, movies, and dramas. She also knows a few people from mainland China, but her Mandarin is not very good. At least she needs to invite Yan Gong to train her for a few months. (Laugh). Shen (Note: That is Miss Gu Shen) still has athlete's foot. I still often go to the beach to fish. It's hard to avoid mahjong, which has caused great damage to my vitality. My appetite is the same as always, don't worry. Wish you peace! Zhang Ji</p>
<p>I wonder when I will receive his letter again, and when I will see his face again?</p>
<p>Gazing sadly at the southern sky, I am silently praying for the health of my friends!</p>
<h3>A Sacrifice</h3>
<p>— Dongfang Shuo</p>
<p>One day, Dongfang Shuo went to a certain rice store to buy rice. There were thousands of buyers. After waiting for a long time, he got three liters. He was joyfully delighted. In the "queue," a three-foot-tall child was knocked into the road by the crowd. A certain bus happened to pass by, and the brakes failed, and the child died. Dongfang Shuo heard the tragic cries and witnessed the tragic scene, and could not help but feel a sense of sorrow in his heart. He took out three grains of "pearl rice" (as rare and precious as pearls) from his bag, threw them on the ground, and spoke a sacrificial verse, sighing and weeping as he told the child, saying:</p>
<p>"Alas, alas! Why did you come here? I think you are no more than eight or nine years old, not yet reaching the legal age of the Labour Bureau; why did you come here? Is it because there are too many people in your family, and you cannot enjoy ready-made meals for two meals a day, and you came to earn your own living? Or did your parents not have time for this and sent you? If you truly love these three liters and came here, then you should be cautious, as if facing a deep abyss, as if treading on thin ice. Why were you not careful, and exchanged your three-foot body for three liters? So that your mother and younger siblings lean on the door all day, hoping for you to return with the rice! If you knew you would die here, why didn't you just starve to death at home? It's all your own fault, what can I say? I shouldn't grieve for you anymore! I will sing a song to comfort you, listen to it! The song says:</p>
<p>"Life and death are destined! How do we know that the old man losing his horse is not a blessing! From now on, your family will save a mouth of food! You can also avoid the suffering of toiling from dawn till dusk, eating wind and drinking dew. I respectfully offer three grains of "pearl rice" here. My family of six, three liters is only enough for one day's full meal. I cannot give you more. May you come and enjoy it!"</p>
<p>After singing, the police arrived with whips. Dongfang Shuo fled in panic. Returning home, he vomited three times, looked up to the sky and sighed, saying: "Although there is millet, can I eat it?"</p>
<p>Dongfang Shuo is truly a man of sorrow!</p>
<p>News from the Xuan Palace</p>
<p>The Tianfeng Theatre Company, which performed at the Xuan Palace Theatre, has recently disbanded. Except for some actors who left, the rest are directly under the Xuan Palace Theatre and have signed contracts. Therefore, all future performances will be handled entirely by the Xuan Palace Theatre in a business-like manner.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Sixteen, The Fire of Youth</p>
<p>"Second Sister, now that Dad has passed away, only the two of us are left in the family. Why must we separate?" Yu Hua said sadly, with a depth of emotion rarely seen in an ordinary businessman.</p>
<p>At the same time, Yu Hua's wife, Jin Yu, was exceptionally virtuous. She did not show any of the usual airs of a madam. Although she and Xiangqi had only met recently, they became very close after spending a few days together. Hearing that Xiangqi wanted to leave, she felt even more distressed than Yu Hua and tried every means to persuade her to stay.</p>
<p>Xiangqi was originally an emotional person, and could not resist the sincere persuasion of the couple, so she had to agree. Thirty to forty days later, a clerk sent by Yu Hua returned from Beiping, bringing back all of Xiangqi's belongings, and also brought her several letters written by acquaintances. But unfortunately, these letters still did not contain any news about the Qiuhaitang father and daughter.</p>
<p>"Unless I can see them again in my dreams!" Xiangqi thought sadly, clutching a broken heart.</p>
<p>However, her brother treated her very well. On the one hand, Yu Hua's business became better day by day. By the time the sound of gunfire rang out in Shanghai, he was already a wealthy merchant with hundreds of thousands of assets. In the small Western-style house he built, Xiangqi also occupied a large and luxuriously furnished room. Every servant treated her with respect, calling her "Auntie," and even Yu Hua's son, Shao Hua, had been taught by his parents to be very respectful to Xiangqi. Whenever he came back from outside, the first thing he would always do was to call "Auntie." (296)</p>
