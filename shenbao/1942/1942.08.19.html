<h3>兩個高調門鬚生（上）</h3>
<p>— 病鳩</p>
<p>——　宋實羅與紀玉良</p>
<p>無論何種技術，流傳旣久，因時代與　境之變遷，而發生極度才變化，此種變化之發生，換言之即派別給歧所由來。輓边伶人，因天賦不足，嗓音氣魄，江河日下，更兼環境誘惑，　賊自傷，老生之學譚者，紙學譚之柔，不學譚之剛，學譯夕低，不學譚之亢；以是調門愈唱愈矮，氣魄愈降愈弱，以致造成今日靡靡夕音之局面。</p>
<p>最沂宋實羅紀玉良二伶之來滬，實予吾人極度之興奮，不論其唱法如何，聽其嗓音之高亢痛快，巳足使人廻腸盈氣，讚嘆不已。今宋紀二伶「輟唱，餘音嬝嬝，尚在耳際，爰就其藝事大體，約略言之。</p>
<p>宋實維嗓音高亢，底氣充足，發音俏拔驚裂，隱約寓肅殺之氣。倒板啤調，游刃有餘，偶使長腔，亦一波三折，剛柔兼備，普階起伏，深得收放縱擒之法，格調頗似高慶奎，低音雖亦悠蕩自如，組具神韻，但細味其音，則細機有之，柔和不足，目梭角迭見，蓋　力未逮也，歌唱發音高易而低難，發低細才音而能圓潤靈活者為尤難。昔日老譚以善唱名，今日玉霜之馳舉歌壇，皆得力於此，寶維於此點尚須力加磨練。至於中音之不耐聽，尤為大病，往往在極精彩之倒板後，原板則平淡無川奇之處，大感失望。此其原因，則在年靑力壯，衷氣充沛，全憑佳嗓以取勝，於音韻夕學，未加注意之故。要知大氣磅礴，賣嗓非賣唱也，充其極亦不過許蔭棠一流人物而已。今寶羅年事方青，目有好嗓，若能揣摹名家唱法，去其組獰，取其肫切，博采衆長，溶為己有，則前途庶有望焉。</p>
<p>訪舞壹藝人</p>
<h3>東山再起的費茵</h3>
<p>— 未人</p>
<p>費茵巳有好久不在舞壹上出現了，或許一設人的印象，對她在慢慢的遺忘，生疏，其實她始終沒有放棄過愛好話劇的興趣，這被遺忘的，生疏的，過程裹，她同梅阡一塊兒在工作着，他們二個人的愛情，是完全建築在事業上，換一句話說，就是相互的認識，相互的了解，相互的努力。</p>
<p>最近她和即將在麗華大戲院演出的中中劇圈，簽訂了合同。記者在她簽計合同的一天，作一次簡單的訴問：</p>
<p>「差不多將近一年了，你不午舞臺上演戲，這一次又怎麽會加人中中劃團呢？」這楚我第一個提出的問句。</p>
<p>一到「中中」演戲，是冷山先生來找我的，我本來就打算要重臨舞臺，學習一些知識，我知道自己的渺小和薄弱，我相信有不斷的奮　，才有偉大的成就。」她說話的熊度，很是莊嚴。</p>
<p>「那末你對於中中劇團可有甚麽感想呢？」我等候着她的寰貴的意見。</p>
<p>「中中劇團是一個新生的劇團，雖然裏面工作的一些藝人，也有是我過去的朋友，而我總以為，新的劇團，有他的新的朝氣和精神，我願意接受新的啟示，創造新的生命？」她的談話，完全有新的力量在灌溉。</p>
<p>接下去，她又談了一些她的過去和現在的生活。</p>
<p>她是北平人，從小生長在天津，電就讀於北平女子學阮，對音樂頗有心得，中西樂器，會的很多。她和梅阡的認識，是在他天津教書的時候。後來來上海後，就加入「天風」，演過「十字街頭」，「恩與仇」，「淘余記」，「孤島男女等許多戲，其中以十字街頭」的楊志英，演來最是成功。</p>
<p>東山再起的費茵，是中中劇團的一朶燦爛的鮮花！</p>
<h3>圈內動態</h3>
<p>— 管華</p>
<p>白雲已於昨日（十八日）早晨離滬赴靑島，此去目的，在活動當地戲劇園　，定下月一日返滬，冉傾全力於一傾國傾城之演出。</p>
<p>二十世紀藝術劇團，因麗都塲地尚無確切答覆，故改變計劃，以「胭脂虎有嘗試演出，地點在俄國藝衛劇院，日期是二十四，五，六，七四天，「春之花之演出，或在秋凉以後。</p>
<p>未明劇團趕排「血淚」，該戲定二十九日在璇宮上演，先試十天，倘成績美滿，或有同璇宮當局簽訂長期合同之可能。</p>
<p>吳景平領導的中中劇團，即將開始排戲，在　華大戲院之第砲，非常隆重，劇本尚在保守秘密中。</p>
<p>此次綠寶的新華劇團招考演員，投考者達一百七十餘人之多，而能選拔錄取者，僅得四人，此四人為試用性質，每月津貼車馬費一百元。另有劇壇的新人」一，已正式加入該團，此後「新華」之陣容，益見堅強。</p>
<h3>「秋海棠」搬上銀幕</h3>
<p>在本報上運載年餘的長篇小說「秋　棠」，是寫一個名伶與軍閥夕妾的一段慘絕人寶的故事。馬徐維邦讀了夕後，決將它搬上銀幕，巳定為「寒山夜雨」後的新作，日前挽友人介紹，　興原作者秦瘦鵬一度會談，雙力的意見，頗為接近。</p>
<p>「秋濟棠是一個唱靑衣的男伶的藝名，即如梅蘭芳等唱靑衣的仱人都得取一個比較香豔的藝名一樣。他在科班中習戲的時候，會受到常閥的侮辱，初不料軍閥之妾也是個被迫的可憐的女學牛，他們在一　偶然的機會中遇見了，在「彼此有同感焉」的情緒中，竟見種情，因之，發生了不可預測的後果。</p>
<p>馬徐維邦表示決然電原著，不過將特別提出一科班，學生的不幸際遇。不渦這位男主角，一時無從定奪，因為在中聯小生陣容中，能哼尖喉矓的不一定就適合秋海棠這角色的個性，女角羅湘綺，仍屬意於李麗華云。有的玩意兒，到底還沒有被中國人自已遺忘掉！」</p>
<p>不過，我希望「業餘木偶劇　」，今後能多演些史有意義的東西，那才是第一要着！</p>
<h3>「恨不相逢未嫁時」　大光明二十日獻演</h3>
<p>高占非返滬後第一部作品「恨不相逢未嫁時」將於二十日起在大光明獻映了、老高離開上海將近五截，上海觀衆，渴望他的新作問世是可以想見的</p>
<p>「恨不相逢未嫁時」的事故，可以當得　感人淚下。四個字，尤其是由衷美靈表演「身世悽凉」的趙小蘭。徐立，章志直，殷秀岑、張琬等也非常努力。</p>
<p>大華舞廳歌星都杰虹影</p>
<h3>簡訊</h3>
<p>戲劇刊物之繼續出版者，祇有「半月戲劇」一種，發行五年，從水間斷，自添闢「話劇園地後，面目為之一新，質單方面，相當充實。叫卷四期新　，已於日前出版，內容較前尤見精采，銅圖二十餘幅，有禮社票房梁小鸞顧正秋諸專員，文字執筆者皆一時知名之士。</p>
<h3>「原始人」導演　虞哲光氏訪問記</h3>
<p>— 靑君</p>
<p>當我在本報見到「原始人」將近上演的消息，引起了我很大的興趣，日昨就去參觀一下他親手製作的木偶。約莫有三尺多高，周身裹以獸皮或樹葉，手脚多用終提拉，尤其偵得一提的楚，那木偶的手脚等部都有關節可以靈活運用。但其他的動物都比人大上了一兩倍，像猛媽（毛象，）恐龍·劍虎等，都比人類大得多。因此，我就擔心着那隻木偶戲檯一定要大得便提綫人感釗吃勿消；或是在台上轉不過來。</p>
<p>等他停了書筆，我就開始了我的開話。</p>
<p>「虞先生楚新近才開始這玩責兒的吧？」</p>
<p>「不是，那還遠在八九年以前的事。當民國二十四年國際兒童聯歡會時，我所作的木人戲，即已在靑年會演出過」</p>
<p>「噢，為什麽虞先生不請我們來看一下呢？」</p>
<p>「當時，我們曾在蘭心，浦東大廈禮堂等處上演過一文天祥「與」臥薪嘗膽」等數劇，但都不是公開售票的，所以外界不大淸楚。」</p>
<p>「那末，這次的規模看樣子一定很人了？」</p>

<h3>斗會</h3>
<p>— 澤夫</p>

<h3>German Troops Advance Towards the Caspian Sea: Grozny Surrounded, Battle for Stalingrad Rages, Soviet Union Calls for National Unity to Defend Against the Enemy</h3>
<p>Reuters, Lisbon, 17th: According to a broadcast from Vichy at 5 PM, German forces have advanced to within 120 kilometers of the Caspian Sea and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with Soviet troops.</p>
<p>Havas, Ukrainian Border, 18th: German and Romanian forces are steadily advancing towards the Caucasus. They have reportedly reached the vicinity of the Kuban River estuary, 18 miles north of the port of Anapa, at a place called Gastogay. In the central Caucasus, German vanguards have reportedly crossed the Batalpashchinsk and reached the vicinity of Chermalinsk, southeast of Adygeysk. German armored units suddenly penetrated the outskirts of Ordzhonikidze yesterday afternoon, and fierce street fighting is now taking place within the city. To the east of that area, German forces reached Betlovsky, 9 miles east of Grozny, yesterday. This morning, other units also arrived 18 miles west of Grozny, thus encircling the city. The city of Belnaya, south of Stalingrad, was occupied on the 15th of this month. It has also been confirmed that German forces are advancing from Elista towards Astrakhan, with the vanguard only 120 miles southeast of the port. Fierce fighting is taking place around Stalingrad. There was also a bloody battle near Ilovlinkaya yesterday morning, and the city is on the verge of falling. The Soviet troops in the Kalach district are putting up strong resistance. German armored car units are advancing along a six-mile front and have already crossed several miles north of the city.</p>
<p>Havas, Stockholm, 18th: Moscow considers the situation around Stalingrad to be very urgent. German engineers have built pontoon bridges on the Don River. The Don River loop is about 120 miles long, and the Soviet Union seems unable to prevent the German army from crossing the river. Soviet troops had gathered on the Godelnikovo highway to prevent the German army from attacking from the southwest. The right wing of this army is now under serious threat, so the German army's situation is becoming more favorable.</p>
<p>Havas, Moscow, 17th: The General Staff of the Red Army recently issued a battle report stating, "In the past 24 hours, our army fought southeast of Kletskaya and northeast of Kotelnikovo. Enemy forces launched repeated attacks, but they were all repelled by our army. Our army held its original positions and remained steadfast. In addition, the Red Army resisted enemy tank and motorized infantry units in the Mineralaanya-Vod region."</p>
<p>Havas, Moscow, 17th: Alexander, the Minister of Propaganda of the Communist Party, delivered a radio address to officers and soldiers of the Red Army and the Soviet Navy today, stating, "The German army is now approaching important centers of our country, and the situation is becoming increasingly serious, even more so than in the summer and autumn of last year. At this moment, the German side is concentrating all its reserve troops, attempting to occupy the richest regions of the Soviet Union, especially the republics in our south, which are famous for producing oil, wheat, and other raw materials. We must find ways to contain them so that they cannot pass through. Therefore, the Red Army will launch a large-scale counter-offensive this year to prevent them from advancing. In the past two months, the Red Army has suffered setbacks, and the reason for this is probably that the German side has transferred all its reserve troops and all its material resources to the front line for combat. In the last World War, Germany was able to resist for four years, even while fighting on two fronts. Today, Germany is only fighting on the Soviet front, and its strength is naturally expected to be great. But in any case, the Red Army's resistance is getting stronger and stronger. The immediate task is to stop the enemy from continuing to advance south. We must regard all the weak and wavering elements in our country as traitors and eliminate them all. In short, if we can stop the enemy from advancing, then the Soviet Union will be assured of ultimate victory."</p>
<p>German Troops March on the Caucasian Front Amidst Suffocating Dust</p>
<p>Haitong Agency, Berlin, 18th: German war correspondent Lorenz writes that the greatest difficulty encountered by the German army, which is currently advancing towards the Caucasus Mountains, is the dust flying everywhere. The Battle of Bataisk was a vast grassland. After passing this, the German army began to reach the cool foothills of the Caucasus Mountains. Armored car units were covered in dust, alongside the infantry column on a rapid march. Handkerchiefs had to be wiped across the face, immediately turning gray. Military uniforms were also covered in dust, appearing as a gray column from a distance.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 18th: The General Headquarters announced this morning that the German army and its allies continued to advance towards the Caucasus yesterday, braving the heat and traversing rugged terrain. Twelve enemy ships were sunk by our air force in the Black Sea ports, and one large oil tanker and eight ammunition ships were damaged. Since the 15th of this month, 12,800 Red Army soldiers have been captured northeast of the Don River loop, and 47 tanks and 252 field guns have been lost. Red Army counterattacks east of Vyazma and in the Rzhev area have all failed. Since the 30th of last month, the Red Army has lost 1,068 tanks.</p>
<h3>Remarkable Achievements of Japanese Submarines Since the Start of the War: Over a Hundred Ships Sunk</h3>
<p>Domei, Tokyo, 17th: The Japanese General Headquarters announced today that Japanese submarines have sunk another ten enemy ships in the seas around Australia from late July to early August. Qualified observers have recently commented on this, saying that since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japanese submarines have sunk 115 enemy ships, totaling 884,000 tons. This is a remarkable achievement, as Japanese submarines must patrol the vast areas of the Pacific and Indian Oceans to search for their spoils, which is not as easy as the congested shipping lanes between America and Europe in the Atlantic Ocean and along the coast of the United States. Now that the enemy has lost another ten transport ships, totaling about 90,000 tons, as announced today, it will be a fatal blow to Australia. If Australia continues to cling to the illusion of relying on Britain and the United States and ignores Japan's control of the ocean, then its days are numbered.</p>
<h3>Sapru's Proposal Not Yet Accepted by the British: Continued Riots in Calcutta, Muslim League Executive Committee Continues Meeting</h3>
<p>Haitong Agency, Stockholm, 18th: According to Swedish newspapers, news from London last night stated that the proposals put forward in the speeches of two major Indian politicians, Sapru and Rajagopalachari (former Premier of Madras), have not been adopted by London. Sapru's proposal to London to send a new delegation to India has not received a response. According to the British explanation, the negotiations that Cripps made to India in New Delhi on behalf of the British government were only a few months ago, and the British proposal to India at that time is still applicable today. Well-informed sources in London stated that Rajagopalachari's appeal to the All-India Muslim League to support the Congress Party's establishment of an Indian provisional government claimed that the conflict between a government including Muslims and the interests of the Allied powers is the same as a purely Indian government.</p>
<p>Haitong Agency, Saigon, 18th: Reuters from Bombay reports that angry mobs rioted and demonstrated in Calcutta yesterday afternoon. Due to strict British censorship of news, details are unclear, but leaked information indicates that the British authorities are still using brutal measures to try to contain these demonstrations. It is also learned that the curfew in New Delhi has been extended by another hour today.</p>
<p>Haitong Agency, Bombay, 17th: The unrest in India has not subsided. Demonstrations and disturbances broke out again in Calcutta today. The curfew in New Delhi has been extended for another two days, and the ban on gatherings of more than five people on the streets has also been extended for five days.</p>
<p>Domei, Lisbon, 18th: According to Reuters from Madura, over 10,000 people rioted in Kumbakonam (Madura State) on the 17th, placing obstacles on the streets and throwing stones, bricks, and broken glass. Several government officials and police officers were injured. The police force attempted to repel the crowds with batons, but to no avail, so they opened fire, resulting in one death and four injuries. In addition, in Bangalore City, Mysore State, the police force opened fire on the people, killing one and injuring 21. Furthermore, some of the troops dispatched to suppress the unrest suffered casualties due to sniper fire, and there were also many casualties among the police force.</p>
<p>Havas, Bombay, 17th: The League Executive Committee continued its meeting today to study the attitude that Muslims should adopt towards Gandhi's arrest and British measures. After several hours of discussion, the meeting was extended to tomorrow to continue discussing the wording of the final resolution draft.</p>
<p>Domei, Buenos Aires, 18th: According to news from Washington, 16 prominent Americans, such as Socialist leader Thomas, have recently called on President Roosevelt to use his power to bring an end to the crisis in India. They urged the President to stop the bloodshed in India, and the way to achieve this goal is not to mediate on the principle of national freedom, but to use his goodwill to help establish a satisfactory provisional government and formulate the terms of cooperation between India and the United Nations.</p>
<p>Haitong Agency, Saigon, 18th: A telegram from New Delhi states that the Indian government is considering convening an emergency meeting of the Central Legislative Assembly. The regular meeting of the assembly was originally scheduled for October 26, including internal ministerial meetings and legislative meetings, also known as the upper and lower houses.</p>

<p>Havas, Rome, 17th: The mouthpiece of Prime Minister Mussolini, Gaeda, recently published an article in the Italian Daily, stating, "Previously, Britain and America had attempted to land on the Mediterranean coast, but as a result of fierce sea and air battles, the Axis powers have won a complete victory. What exactly is the plan of Britain and America? Why have they sent such a large fleet into the Mediterranean? One cannot help but have various speculations. It is true that Malta should be reinforced and resupplied, but the fleet that Britain and America attempted to force through the Strait of Sicily is so large that it cannot be accommodated by the port of Malta. In our estimation, Britain and America have even greater ambitions. According to the reconnaissance photos of our aircraft, it has been proven that British and American warships and transport ships are equipped with small boats, one of which is about 50 feet long. Moreover, after many battles, British warships would turn back and return whenever they sailed to the Strait of Sicily, but this time they ignored the resistance of our air force and still attempted to force through. Its mission must undoubtedly be important. It is not impossible for Britain and America to attempt to land on the Mediterranean coast of Europe or Africa. If so, then the significance of the Axis powers' great victory in the sea and air battles will be even more important." A German torpedo boat sunk.</p>
<h3>British and German Artillery Battle Across the English Channel: A German Torpedo Boat Sunk</h3>

<h3>Strange Aircraft Sighted Over Rome</h3>

<h3>Anglo-American-Soviet Cooperation in War, Important Resolutions Reached, Anglo-Soviet Alliance Reaffirmed, Churchill Returns to London with Harriman</h3>
<p>Moscow, 17th (Domei) - The Soviet government announced on the 17th regarding Churchill's visit to the Soviet Union that, during his stay in Moscow from August 12th to 15th, Churchill held several consultations with Stalin, and the heads of the two governments reached important decisions regarding the conduct of the war, and further reaffirmed the alliance between Britain and the Soviet Union in the war against Germany and its European allies.</p>
<p>Ankara, 18th (Haitong News Agency) - According to a special dispatch from Moscow, British Prime Minister Churchill arrived in Moscow on the 12th of this month and, after a three-day meeting with Soviet leaders, flew from Moscow yesterday morning back to London. Accompanying him was Harry Hopkins, the special representative for U.S. war supplies. The plane he took had four engines and was the same one Churchill used to fly to Moscow.</p>
<p>London, 17th (Havas) - Regarding the results of the Moscow Conference, the official communique was released tonight as follows: "Chairman of the Soviet People's Committee, Stalin, and British Prime Minister Churchill held an important meeting in Moscow. President Roosevelt's representative Harriman, Soviet Foreign People's Commissar Molotov, Commander-in-Chief of the Red Army General Voroshilov, British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Cripps, British Chief of Staff General Brooke, Undersecretary of the Foreign Office Cadogan, and British military representatives were present. Important decisions were made regarding the common war against Hitlerism. In essence, the British and Soviet governments have decided to devote all their resources to the war until Hitlerism and its tyranny collapse. The negotiations were conducted with utmost sincerity, and the two governments had the opportunity to reaffirm their close and seamless relationship, which is fully supported by the United States regarding the Anglo-Soviet alliance.</p>
<p>Progress of the Three-Power Talks</p>
<p>London, 17th (Havas) - According to an official announcement, Prime Minister Churchill flew to Moscow at 4:00 AM on the 12th of this month aboard a four-engine "Liberator" bomber, accompanied by President Roosevelt's personal representative Harriman, the Prime Minister's personal physician, and secretary. Soon after, a British-American delegation of twenty people arrived, including key figures such as Chief of the Imperial General Staff Sir Brooke, Permanent Under-Secretary of the Foreign Office Cadogan, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in India General Wavell, Commander of the British Air Force in the Middle East Tedder, Commander of the American Forces in Egypt Major General Maxwell, and American Major General Patton. Upon arriving in Moscow, the Prime Minister told the press that the purpose of this trip was to express Britain's determination to fight alongside the Soviet Union in the current difficult situation, and that no matter how difficult the future may be, the two countries will fight until Hitlerism is eliminated from the earth. When Churchill and Harriman disembarked, Soviet Foreign People's Commissar Molotov, Red Army Chief of Staff General Shaposhnikov, British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Cripps, U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Admiral Standley, and General Bradley, who had just arrived from Washington a few days ago, were at the airport to welcome them. The short speeches given by Churchill and Harriman were recorded for future broadcast. That evening, the two British and American giants held their first meeting with Stalin, which lasted for more than four hours. Churchill and Stalin were meeting for the first time. The next day, Churchill spoke with Soviet Foreign People's Commissar Molotov for a long time, and in the afternoon, he held a second meeting with Stalin. By the 14th of this month, several important negotiations had been held. Stalin hosted a banquet at the Kremlin for Prime Minister Churchill and the British and American representatives. All the key members of the Soviet government were present. The atmosphere was harmonious, and the conversations were no different from those during negotiations. Stalin, Cripps, and Standley all raised their glasses in toasts, and the event ended in joy at midnight. The next afternoon, Churchill and Harriman visited the outskirts of Moscow, and in the evening, Churchill had his final meeting with Stalin. However, complete agreements on all important issues had been reached in previous meetings. Harriman participated in every meeting between the two leaders. According to Harriman's statement to the Soviet press, "The U.S. President ordered me to accompany Prime Minister Churchill on this trip at this crucial moment. The President had already expressed his agreement in advance on the decisions to be taken at the Anglo-Soviet meeting. It is clear that the United States is determined to fight shoulder to shoulder with the Soviet Union on the battlefield." The Anglo-Soviet talks concluded on the 15th of this month. According to an official announcement from here, important decisions have been made on all issues related to the war, but the specific measures and content of the decisions will not be disclosed. After returning to London, Prime Minister Churchill immediately sent a telegram to Stalin expressing his gratitude. The telegram read, "I am deeply grateful for your kind hospitality during my visit to your capital. I dare to express my gratitude in this telegram. I found this trip to be one of the most gratifying experiences of my life, as it gave me the opportunity to explain everything to you, which is my responsibility, and to meet with you, which will be of great benefit to the cooperation between our two countries. I hope you will understand my humble intentions and please convey my regards to your Foreign People's Commissar Molotov."</p>
<p>Wavell's Participation is of Great Significance</p>
<p>Goose Bay, 18th (Domei) - It is reported that observers here believe that the participation of General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in India, in the Moscow Conference is of great significance, and that concrete suggestions for lifting the siege of the Soviet forces defending the Caucasus and opening a second front were likely discussed at the conference. According to Reuters dispatches received here, General Wavell has recently been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Indian 10th Army, which is being established in Iran.</p>
<p>Rumors of Separate Peace Eliminated</p>
<p>Stockholm, 18th (Havas) - According to a report from Moscow, the results of the meeting between Stalin and Churchill did not generate as much enthusiasm among the Soviet people as Molotov's visit to London and Washington in May and June to sign the Anglo-Soviet alliance. The issue of opening a second front in Europe this year seems to have been implicitly shelved. In addition, judging from the communique released yesterday in London, the two sides still need to continue "negotiations." Churchill's telegram to Stalin after returning home also stated that "full explanation is his duty." It seems that the Allied nations still need to "explain." What the Soviet people need is not explanations, but the immediate opening of a second front. However, Churchill's trip to Moscow has certainly accomplished one thing: it has eliminated rumors of a separate peace between Germany and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Speculations on the Purpose of the British Prime Minister's Visit to the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Domei) - Regarding the news of the Anglo-American-Soviet Moscow talks, apart from repeated reports from Berlin, London and Moscow have made no announcements. There are many speculations about Churchill's purpose in visiting the Soviet Union. The opinions of neutral countries are summarized as follows: The rapid expansion of German military gains in the Caucasus and the serious situation on the Eastern Front have forced Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to urgently consult and discuss common countermeasures. Due to the urgent crisis on the Eastern Front, the Soviet Union's demand for the establishment of a second front has become increasingly strong, but the establishment of a second front is practically impossible for Britain and the United States. Therefore, Churchill had to personally visit the Soviet Union to meet with Soviet authorities to explain and conduct direct and concrete negotiations on issues such as arms supplies. Due to the rapid advance of the German army, the Soviet Union is increasingly in danger. Churchill's visit to the Soviet Union allows him to personally inspect the situation and conduct a thorough and final review of the Soviet Union's ability to resist and other aspects. In short, the three-power talks must be to discuss countermeasures against the defeat of the United Nations, especially on how to maintain the Soviet Union's ability to resist, is beyond doubt.</p>
<p>Rome, 17th (Havas) - According to a dispatch from a correspondent of the Radol News Agency stationed in Ankara, the British government, due to the defeat at Tobruk, diverted a batch of arms and equipment destined for the Soviet Union from Basra, Iraq, to North Africa, which led to the collapse of the Soviet defense line near the Caucasus. Prime Minister Churchill had no choice but to visit Moscow to explain the situation to Stalin. British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Cripps strongly advocated that the British Prime Minister personally visit Moscow.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Domei) - According to a dispatch from London, Churchill held talks with South African Prime Minister Smuts, who was staying in Cairo, during his transit through Cairo on his way to Moscow.</p>
<p>Berlin Closely Watches</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Haitong News Agency) - At yesterday's information conference at the German Foreign Ministry, Minister Schmidt, in answering questions about Churchill's trip to the Soviet Union, first pointed out that German newspapers had published a German news agency report on the nature of Churchill's meeting in the Soviet Union. He then added that the German side was paying close attention to Churchill's trip to the Soviet Union because Churchill's foreign trips were often seen as a symbol of a serious military and political situation. Minister Schmidt, in discussing Molotov's appointment as Deputy Chairman of the Soviet People's Committee, stated that after this change in Soviet domestic politics, Stalin's absolute power in politics had been somewhat limited.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Domei) - Since the outbreak of the European War, British Prime Minister Churchill has traveled abroad five times, including this visit to Moscow. The first time was in June of the year before last, when France was about to surrender, to request the French government to continue fighting against Germany. The second time was on August 14th of last year, when he met with Roosevelt on the "Prince of Wales" to formulate the Atlantic Charter. The third time was in December of last year, when he crossed the Atlantic aboard the "Duke of York" battleship and visited the United States on the 22nd of that month. On December 26th, Churchill gave a speech at a joint session of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, then went to Canada, and returned to Washington, where he signed the anti-Axis alliance treaty of 26 countries, including Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, on January 2nd of this year.

<h3>Major Players Take Profits at High Levels, Bond Market Falls</h3>
<p>Yesterday's unified public bond market situation was volatile and rapidly changed. Generally excited bulls saw that each bond was high and fixed, especially the C type, which not only failed to see the 40 yuan mark, but also turned back. In the trend, the buyers hesitated, so the buying sentiment that permeated the previous day was frustrated. Generally those who profited and the sellers were under this situation, and they could not but take advantage of the situation. Therefore, the selling sentiment turned stronger after entering the stage. However, retail investors tried to push the price up, and finally there were differences. At the opening in the morning, Qingan was the first to advance strongly, followed by Tongli, Tongyuan, Tongyu, Shuntai, etc., which continued to absorb quite strongly. Then, the C type saw a high price of 9 yuan and 70 cents, and A reached 40 yuan and 2 cents. However, due to the sales of major players, such as Dachung, Xinhua Bank, Runli, Hu Heji, Dakang, etc., each detective saw a small return. As a result, except for E which was good for a cent, A and D were flat, and B and C were slightly down by one or two cents. In the arena, the high-level and late-handedness of the major players hindered the entry of new long positions and the addition of old long positions. Therefore, if the absorption of regular customers is equal, it may first soften and then harden. The total turnover is about 2 million yuan. The list is shown below.</p>
<h3>Stocks Weaken, Trading Is Quite Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market turned weak. Only Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory in the new pharmaceutical industry狂退 from 44 yuan to 42 yuan and a half in the selling atmosphere. At one time, there were few buyers, and the final軋小 was one yuan. Sino-French fell by more than one yuan, and the rest were平定. In the cultural industry, only Commercial Press削低 five yuan. China and World were 平. In the department store industry, Chiyi fell by nearly one yuan. Wing On and Sincere each fell by five yuan to two yuan. Da Zhonghua Match rose by two yuan and a half to reach the 190 yuan mark. Chinese Electric Power rose slightly, and Zhabei Water and Electricity fell to 31 yuan, and then returned to flat. Nanyang Tobacco fell from 72 yuan to 68 yuan, and finally saw a return to上, which was the same as the previous day's price. There were few changes in the rest. In addition, Xinfeng Printing and Dyeing Factory, with a long history and excellent products, especially the White Cat brand calico and Peach Blossom Ms. Lin cloth, are the most widely sold. In order to expand its business, it has increased its capital, and its new shares have entered the market and are very popular among investors. The transaction price is between 23 and 4 yuan. The transaction of each stock is quite active. According to all parties, the人心 is still坚定. The market prices of each stock are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Hefeng Stock Company Opens</h3>
<p>Hefeng Stock Company, located at 153 Wuma Road in this city, was organized by the financial industry and opened the day before yesterday. For a time, the guest was full of people, and the grand scene was unprecedented. The company has strong funds and a sound organization. It is said that it has accepted the entrustment of several factories to handle capital increase matters.</p>
<p>In addition, China Stock Company has recently issued a book called "Compilation of Chinese Merchant Stocks" in order to meet the needs of investors in Chinese shares. The content is quite valuable. All sectors can go directly to the company at 316 Jiangxi Road for an interview.</p>
<h3>Autumn and Winter Cloth Sales Look Promising; Piece Goods Merchants Unwilling to Loosen Sales</h3>
<p>Merchants in the market east of the city yesterday were determined and confident. Although actual sales were slow, those holding goods in the industry hoped for the arrival of autumn and winter for improved prospects. Their attitude was very calm, and most were unwilling to lower prices. Prices of fine cloth rose slightly, about one yuan per piece. For example, 16-pound Globe coarse cloth was 177 yuan, Flying Goose 174 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong 106 yuan, 9-pound New Character 108 yuan, 12-pound Globe fine cloth 161 yuan, Dapeng 152 yuan, Fugui 154 yuan, Magnolia bleached cloth 161 yuan, Qin Liangyu 152 yuan, Longevity Mansion silk 5 yuan and 9 jiao, Changting 5 yuan and 7 jiao, Volleyball 3 yuan and 9 jiao, Three Sheep Serge 5 yuan and 9 jiao, and Qin Meiren cotton cloth 132 yuan, all showed increases.

<p>Eastern cloth first fell and then rose, showing a firm trend. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at 176 yuan, 7 jiao, and noon closed at 178 yuan and a half, an increase of 5 jiao. Bank orders were 158 yuan and a half, Color Ball 163 yuan, Flying Fish 160 yuan, and Yang He 158 yuan, all up by more than one yuan. Four Gentlemen Serge started at 7 yuan, 2 jiao, and 2 fen, fell to 7 yuan, 1 jiao, and 2 fen, but buyers rushed in, raising it to 7 yuan, 3 jiao at closing. In after-hours trading, it was 7 yuan, 3 jiao, and 2 fen, a total increase of about 1 jiao, reportedly due to a shortage of Red Factory orders.</p>
<h3>Gold Jewelry Drops 50 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold jewelry industry in the city quoted the price of gold per tael (ounce) in Sichuan currency. It initially opened at 2,200 yuan, but around 10 o'clock, it dropped 50 yuan to 2,150 yuan (buying price reduced by 350 yuan). Cash stores quoted 2,100 yuan in Sichuan currency, also lowering by 50 yuan after 10 o'clock, with the buying price reduced by 300 yuan, some reducing by 200 yuan and quoting 1,900 yuan. The price among fellow traders continued to decline. The initial settling price was 1,890 yuan, then gradually declined by 35 yuan amidst selling pressure, falling to 1,855 yuan. The noon price was 1,860 yuan, which was a decrease of 30 yuan or 35 yuan from the previous day, with a total volume of over one hundred taels. Silver ingots were still quoted at 16 yuan per tael, with an inter-dealer price of 10 yuan, 0 jiao, and 8.9 fen.</p>
<h3>Military Scrip Slightly Down</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign exchange market, the inter-dealer price of military scrip slightly retreated to 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, 5.6 li, with storefront buy/sell quotes at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen and a half, and 6 fen and a half.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate of the Money Trade Association remained unchanged at 1 jiao and 6 fen, with new calls for balancing spot cash.</p>
<h3>Bean Trade Sparse; Dried Sweet Potato Prices Remain Firm</h3>
<p>The bean trade was quite slow yesterday, and the market was calm. Only 60 bags of Chongming sand silkworms were sold in the general market, priced at 122 yuan to 123 yuan.</p>
<p>The price of dried sweet potatoes was slightly lower due to the lack of burlap bags and the change to grass bags for packaging, but the underlying trend remained firm. Yesterday, 40 bags of Qingdao dried sweet potatoes were offered at 106 yuan, and 20 bags of Jiangbei dried sweet potatoes were offered at 107 yuan, all self-offered.</p>
<p>Red sorghum arrivals and sales were both quiet, and trading had been scarce for a long time. Yesterday, 50 bags of Mingguang red sorghum were sold at 109 yuan and a half.</p>

<h3>Sugar Stock Trading Increases Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar stock orders at the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office were stable and firm according to the market association's settlement.

Trading increased slightly, with a total of 1,300 bags traded.</p>
<h3>New Watermelon Seeds Already on the Market</h3>
<p>The four bags of new black watermelon seeds that arrived from Guzhen a few days ago had been shelved for many days without hope of improvement. Yesterday, they were settled at 450 yuan, indicating that the market remains weak. However, the production price is still upside down, and losses must still be absorbed.</p>
<h3>Hawthorn Slices</h3>
<p>The market price for old hawthorn slices remains stable, with recent arrivals being scarce. Stocks in the market are gradually returning to Sichuan, so prices are moderate. Yesterday, a certain company offered 80 bags, the goods were still good, but the color was slightly inferior, and they were settled at 105 yuan. Recently, the Guangdong merchants' appetite for stomachics has gradually increased, while the pharmaceutical merchants' transactions are not many, and the market is stable.</p>
<h3>National and Japanese Cigarettes</h3>
<p>Active hoarding...Market sentiment remains firm. The cigarette market has seen gradual price increases due to hoarding and strong actual sales. Hoarders of British and American goods are not moving, and prices are stable. The market for national and Japanese cigarettes remains brisk, making it difficult for prices to fall. Yesterday, Great Britain brand was quoted at 8,450 yuan, Old Knife brand at 5,700 yuan, Pinhai brand at 5,100 yuan, Small Fairy brand at 4,300 yuan, Five Flowers brand at 4,100 yuan, Japanese Golden Gun brand at 1,830 yuan, Golden Mansion at 2,280 yuan, Quanlu brand at 1,980 yuan, Nianzhi Quanlu had the same price, Guide brand at 1,580 yuan, National Golden Mouse brand at 1,800 yuan, Beautiful brand at 3,150 yuan, and Pyramid at 3,300 yuan. Transactions in daily necessities are sluggish, and prices remain stable.</p>
<h3>A New Batch of Guanmi Rice Has Arrived</h3>
<p>Tonglai Company cabled that they had found a way to transport a batch of Guanmi rice, which is currently in season and in short supply in Shanghai, so the market is quite firm. The asking price is reportedly 550 yuan. According to investigations, there are still old stocks in the market, and although they are worm-eaten, it does not affect the quality, as the worm-eaten part is only the core of the rice, which should be removed anyway, and it is said to taste soft and delicious when cooked.</p>

<h3>Two High-Pitched Beards (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Sick Dove</p>
<p>—— Song Shiluo and Ji Yuliang</p>
<p>Regardless of the skill, it has been a long time in circulation, due to changes in the times and environment, and has undergone extreme changes. The occurrence of this change, in other words, is the origin of factional divergence. In recent years, actors have been deficient in talent, their voices and bearing have declined, and they have also been tempted by the environment, hurting themselves. Those who study the old male roles only learn Tan Xinpei's softness, not his strength, learn the decline of translation, not the arrogance of Tan Xinpei; thus, the tone becomes shorter and shorter, and the bearing becomes weaker and weaker, resulting in the current situation of decadent sounds.</p>
<p>The recent arrival of the two actors, Song Shiluo and Ji Yuliang, in Shanghai has given us great excitement. Regardless of their singing style, listening to their high-pitched and joyful voices is enough to make people feel uplifted and amazed. Now that Song and Ji have stopped singing, the lingering sound is still in my ears, so I will roughly talk about the general situation of their artistic careers.</p>
<p>Song Shilu's voice is high-pitched, his breath is full, and his pronunciation is crisp and surprising, implicitly containing a sense of solemnity. He is proficient in inverted boards and beer tunes, and he also uses long tunes occasionally, with twists and turns, combining rigidity and softness, with rising and falling tones, deeply grasping the method of releasing and controlling. His style is quite similar to Gao Qingkui. Although his low voice is also leisurely and free, it has a subtle charm, but tasting his voice carefully, it is subtle, but lacks gentleness, and the edges and corners are repeatedly seen, because the strength is not enough. It is easy to sing high and difficult to sing low in singing pronunciation. It is especially difficult to emit low and fine sounds and be able to be round, smooth, and flexible. In the past, Tan Xinpei was famous for his good singing, and today Yu Shusheng's success in the music world is all due to this. Bao Wei still needs to work hard on this point. As for the unpleasantness of the middle voice, it is a major problem. Often, after the extremely wonderful inverted board, the original board is plain and has no wonders, which is very disappointing. The reason for this is that he is young, strong, and full of energy, and he relies entirely on his good voice to win, and has not paid attention to the study of phonology. It is important to know that a grand spirit is selling the voice, not the singing, and at best it is only a figure like Xu Yintang. Now that Baoluo is young and has a good voice, if he can learn from the singing methods of famous artists, remove the fierceness, take the sincerity, and absorb the strengths of others and integrate them into his own, then the future can be hoped for.</p>
<p>Visiting a Dancer</p>
<h3>Fei Yin's Comeback</h3>
<p>— Wei Ren</p>
<p>Fei Yin has not appeared on the dance stage for a long time. Perhaps people's impressions of her are slowly fading and becoming unfamiliar. In fact, she has never given up her interest in drama. In this forgotten and unfamiliar process, she has been working with Mei Qian. The love between the two of them is completely built on their careers. In other words, they recognize each other, understand each other, and work hard together.</p>
<p>Recently, she signed a contract with the Zhongzhong Drama Troupe, which will perform at the Lihua Grand Theatre. The reporter conducted a brief interview with her on the day she signed the contract:</p>
<p>"It's been almost a year since you performed on stage. Why did you join the Zhongzhong Troupe this time?" This was the first question I asked.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lengshan came to me about performing at Zhongzhong. I originally planned to return to the stage to learn some knowledge. I know my own insignificance and weakness. I believe that with constant effort, there will be great achievements," she said in a very solemn manner.</p>
<p>"Then what are your thoughts on the Zhongzhong Drama Troupe?" I waited for her valuable opinion.</p>
<p>"The Zhongzhong Drama Troupe is a new troupe. Although some of the artists working in it are also my friends from the past, I always think that a new troupe has its own new vitality and spirit. I am willing to accept new inspirations and create new life?" Her conversation was full of new power.</p>
<p>Next, she talked about some of her past and present life.</p>
<p>She is from Beiping and grew up in Tianjin. She studied at Beiping Women's University and has a good understanding of music. She knows many Chinese and Western musical instruments. She and Mei Qian met when he was teaching in Tianjin. Later, after coming to Shanghai, she joined "Tianfeng" and performed in many plays such as "Crossroads," "Gratitude and Hatred," "Tao Yu Ji," and "Isolated Island Men and Women," among which Yang Zhiying in "Crossroads" was the most successful.</p>
<p>Fei Yin, who has made a comeback, is a brilliant flower in the Zhongzhong Drama Troupe!</p>
<h3>Inside the Circle</h3>
<p>— Guan Hua</p>
<p>Bai Yun left Shanghai for Qingdao early yesterday morning (the 18th). The purpose of this trip is to activate the local drama scene and return to Shanghai on the first of next month to devote all efforts to the performance of A Fallen City.</p>
<p>The 20th Century Art Troupe has changed its plans because Lido Theater has not given a definite answer. They will try to perform "Rouge Tiger" at the Russian Art Defense Theater on the 24th, 25th, 26th, and 27th for four days. The performance of "Spring Flowers" may be after the autumn coolness.</p>
<p>The Weiming Troupe is rushing to rehearse "Blood and Tears." The play is scheduled to be staged at the Xuan Palace on the 29th for a ten-day trial. If the results are satisfactory, there may be a possibility of signing a long-term contract with the Xuan Palace authorities.</p>
<p>The Zhongzhong Drama Troupe, led by Wu Jingping, is about to start rehearsing. The first shot at Huada Grand Theatre is very grand. The script is still being kept secret.</p>
<p>This time, the New China Troupe of Lubao recruited actors, and more than 170 people applied, but only four were selected. These four are on a trial basis, with a monthly allowance of 100 yuan for transportation expenses. Another "newcomer to the drama world," Yi, has officially joined the troupe. From then on, the lineup of "New China" will become stronger.</p>
<h3>"Begonia" on the Silver Screen</h3>
<p>The long novel "Begonia," which has been published in this newspaper for more than a year, tells the tragic story of a famous actor and a warlord's concubine. After reading it, Ma Xu Weibang decided to put it on the silver screen as his new work after "Cold Mountain Night Rain." A friend recently introduced him to have a meeting with the original author, Qin Shoupeng, and the opinions of both parties were very close.</p>
<p>"Qiuhaitang" is the stage name of a male actor who sings Qingyi roles, just like Mei Lanfang and others who sing Qingyi roles must take a more glamorous stage name. When he was studying opera in the class, he was insulted by the Chang warlord. Unexpectedly, the warlord's concubine was also a poor female student who was forced. They met by chance in an opportunity, and in the mood of "feeling the same way," they developed a relationship, which led to unpredictable consequences.</p>
<p>Ma Xu Weibang expressed his determination to make a film of the original work, but he will specially focus on the unfortunate experiences of students in the opera school. However, the male lead has not been decided yet, because among the young male actors in the China United Film Company, those who can hum in a shrill voice may not necessarily be suitable for the personality of Qiuhaitang. The female lead, Luo Xiangqi, is still considering Li Lihua, he said. There are some tricks that have not been forgotten by the Chinese themselves!"</p>
<p>However, I hope that the "Amateur Puppet Theatre" can perform more meaningful things in the future, that is the first priority!</p>
<h3>"If Only We Had Met Before Marriage" Premieres at the Grand Theatre on the 20th</h3>
<p>Gao Zhanfei's first work after returning to Shanghai, "If Only We Had Met Before Marriage," will premiere at the Grand Theatre on the 20th. It has been almost five years since Lao Gao left Shanghai, and it is conceivable that Shanghai audiences are looking forward to the release of his new work.</p>
<p>The story of "If Only We Had Met Before Marriage" can be described as touching and tear-jerking. The four words are especially true of Zhao Xiaolan's performance of "a miserable life" by Zhong Meiling. Xu Li, Zhang Zhizhi, Yin Xiucen, Zhang Wan and others have also worked very hard.</p>
<p>Du Jiehong, singer at Dahua Ballroom</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>The only drama publication that continues to be published is "Semi-Monthly Drama," which has been published for five years without interruption. Since the addition of "Drama Garden," the appearance has been renewed, and the quality of the single aspect is quite substantial. The new issue of Volume 4, Issue 4 was published a few days ago, and the content is even more exciting than before, with more than 20 copperplate illustrations, including the Li She ticket office, Liang Xiaoluan, Gu Zhengqiu and other commissioners, and the writers are all well-known people of the time.</p>
<h3>Interview with Yu Zeguang, Director of "The Primitive Man"</h3>
<p>— Qing Jun</p>
<p>When I saw the news in this newspaper that "The Primitive Man" was about to be staged, it aroused my great interest. Yesterday, I went to see the puppets he made by hand. They are about three feet tall, wrapped in animal skins or leaves, and their hands and feet are mostly controlled by strings. What is particularly worth mentioning is that the hands and feet of the puppets have joints that can be used flexibly. But the other animals are one or two times larger than humans, such as the mammoth (woolly mammoth), dinosaur, and saber-toothed tiger, which are much larger than humans. Therefore, I was worried that the puppet stage must be so large that the string pullers would feel overwhelmed; or that they would not be able to turn around on stage.</p>
<p>After he stopped writing, I started my conversation.</p>
<p>"Mr. Yu, did you just start playing with this thing recently?"</p>
<p>"No, that was long ago, eight or nine years ago. When the International Children's Carnival was held in the 24th year of the Republic of China, the puppet show I made had already been performed at the Youth Association."</p>
<p>"Oh, why didn't Mr. Yu invite us to come and see it?"</p>
<p>"At that time, we had performed several plays such as "Wen Tianxiang" and "Lying on Firewood to Taste Gall" at the Lyceum, the Pudong Mansion Auditorium, and other places, but none of them were publicly ticketed, so the outside world was not very clear."</p>
<p>"Then, it looks like this time the scale must be very large?"</p>
<p>"Not necessarily, but the cost cannot be considered small, especially in the past month, I have almost not slept well or eaten a meal, but the excitement is really great."</p>
<p>"Indeed, this play - "The Primitive Man" - is full of educational meaning, but I wonder what Mr. Chu's plans are for the future?"</p>
<p>"After "The Primitive Man," we are preparing two plays, but I think it is better not to announce the names of these plays for the time being." Then Mr. Yu smiled and said, "Sorry."</p>
<p>At this point, I saw that they were all very busy, especially another producer, Mr. Li Zhenzhi, and Miss Ma Xuruo, who was arranging the music, and other workers were sweating, and I was embarrassed to delay any longer, so I had to say goodbye.</p>
<p>As I happily stepped out of that old school gate, I thought, "These unique</p>
<p>Things have not been forgotten by the Chinese themselves after all!"</p>
<p>However, I hope that the "Amateur Puppet Theatre" can perform more meaningful things in the future, that is the first priority!</p>

<h3>Dou Hui (Ritual Gathering)</h3>
<p>— Ze Fu</p>
<p>In the Zhejiang area, whenever there is a funeral or a Mid-Year Festival, the family will summon Taoist priests to perform rituals involving chanting, singing, and drumming, known as Dou Hui. Its nature is quite similar to the release of flaming mouths by monks. The Yun Ji Qi Qian of Taoism says: "The Dan Yuan Star Heavenly Dou Lord is in charge of the registers of life and fortune, the upper laws of the Nine Heavens, the middle command of the departments of ghosts and gods, and the lower command of the registers of the lives of the people who study the truth." Therefore, there are secular rituals of paying homage to the Dipper to pray for blessings. The Dou in this Dou Hui should refer to the Dou Lord. However, although the monks' flaming mouth rituals also involve some drumming, chanting sutras is the main thing; this kind of Dou Hui specializes in drumming, chanting and singing, and chanting sutras is secondary. Each gathering involves a minimum of seven or eight people and a maximum of ten or more. The songs performed may be current tunes or short operas, and the content is chosen by the host. According to Fan Zushu's "Hangzhou Customs and Legacy" written during the Tongzhi period: "A singing troupe, the signboard says, 'Offering tea and banquets, paying homage to the Dipper to bless fortune.' For birthdays, they specialize in singing operas. The troupe members are proficient in eleven melodies. There are large boxes, medium boxes, and small boxes. The large and medium boxes have some decorations, with two square tables placed opposite each other at the door. The large box can accommodate eight people, the medium box can accommodate six people, and the small box can only accommodate four people." The note goes on to say: "This is what the Shaoxing people and Taoist priests do now. The people of Hangzhou do not trust them very much. Shaoxing people who reside in Hangzhou for funerals all use them." This is actually another name for Dou Hui, and it is known that it was already very popular between the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat in Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(8) What to do?</p>
<p>Mrs. Ye said, "You don't need any matchmaker. Old Mrs. Chen is also a straightforward person. Ordinary old ladies wouldn't say such things." Wei Cheng said, "Yes, when I heard her words, I felt like I had taken a stimulant. I went to Shanghai in the afternoon. I first went to Gu Qizhi's residence to look for Gu Qi. When I asked, I learned that Gu Qi had returned home. I found them at their home. Gu Qi and Gu Fang were about to go out, so we met. The siblings grabbed one of my hands each and didn't let me into the house. Instead, they took me to a small restaurant for dinner. They asked me what I was doing in Shanghai. I only said, 'I missed you so much after not seeing you for so long. It snowed, and I felt as happy as Dai Kui did when he visited Shanxi. I came to Shanghai from Shuangqiao.' Gu Qi's temperament was still so bold, and Gu Fang's temperament was still so lively. I asked them what they were busy with, and they said they weren't busy with anything. There were many people eavesdropping in the small restaurant, so I didn't say anything. After dinner, I wanted to open a room in a hotel in the central area and invite them to have a long talk. They said, 'Our father is sick, and we have to go home at night and can't keep you company.' I asked what kind of illness it was, and they said, 'He has been sick for several months, sometimes better and sometimes worse. He has been wheezing badly these past few days.' When I heard them say that, I couldn't force them."</p>
<p>Mrs. Ye said, "That's why things often happen unexpectedly. Later, did you open a room?" Wei Cheng said, "I did. It's a joke to tell you. A Yu and I only planned to go to Shuangqiao, not to Shanghai. I felt that I didn't have enough money. When I told them that, Gu Fang took out thirty yuan for me." Mrs. Ye said, "In the future, when you go out, you must bring more money." Wei Cheng said, "Yes, but this is a rare occurrence. The next day, I called Gu Fang from the hotel. Gu Fang came alone, Gu Qi didn't come. At that time, I ignored everything and brought up the issue of marriage with Gu Fang. Aunt, guess what happened? I shouldn't have mentioned it. Even now, my face still feels hot." Mrs. Ye said, "What? Did she reject you?" Wei Cheng said, "She said, 'If you had mentioned this half a year ago, I would have agreed to you immediately, without hesitation. Now, unfortunately, it's too late. I have things that are more important than marriage." (158)</p>
