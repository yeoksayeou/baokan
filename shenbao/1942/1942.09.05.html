<p>瑞典京城四日哈瓦斯社電　德軍總攻斯達林城內圍防綫之緊急情形、與時俱增、城北城西戰事亦甚猛烈、蘇聯軍隊步步退却、不得不集中在較狹促區城、據蘇聯方面公報、德車機械化部隊所受損失尚難全部統計、僅知在一處戰區、德軍戰車三十八輛中、被擊毀者僅有六輛、另一處德軍戰車二十輛中、有十一輛被衝過、時至此際、德軍突破斯達林城內圍防綫之處、已不勝枚舉、軍事專家今日咸謂、蘇聯軍隊挽救斯達秣城之希望、已日趨渺茫、守軍雖在數處地方從事反攻、亦無法轉危爲安、德方丞認敵軍抵抗堅强、作戰勇敢、但預料斯達林城之陷落、僅時間問題、惟亦不以爲守軍將突然屈服、蓋有奧特薩及塞伐斯托波爾前車可鍳也、四十八小時以來、德軍在城南之攻勢、益見激烈、並巳於惡戰後奪獲山頭一座、該山足以俯視克拉斯那梅斯克鎭、至於城西城北、蘇聯軍隊抵抗較有效力、至於德軍其他目標有二、一爲黑海要港諾伏洛西斯克、一爲高加索方而之格洛慈尼、黑海方面、德軍攻勢已爲大雨及地勢所阻、蘇聯方面、則擬自海道接濟諾伏洛西斯克、似有久守之意、惟增援部隊能否及時開到、頗屬可疑、格洛慈尼方面、德軍步兵及戰車、已渡過特勒克沙、油區已受直接威脅、</p>
<h3>諾伏洛西斯克西北一帶戰</h3>
<p>莫斯科三日哈瓦斯社電　蘇聯統帥部頃發表戰報　、過去二十四小時上、我軍在斯達林城西北、西南及諾伏洛西斯克港西北一帶與德軍　戰、其他各縣無重要變化、</p>
<p>烏克蘭邊境哈瓦斯社電　前縣昨日最重大之變化、　為德軍向諾伏洛西斯克附近進展、距該港僅十英里之夏浦蘇格斯加亞城、昨已被德、羅聯軍佔據莫、斯科今晨首次發表公報、提及諾伏洛西斯克東北之戰事、德國飛機不斷轟炸該港、預料該區現正從事大規模撒退、目前在諾港之蘇軍似有三師、高加索前錢共他各路局勢、較爲穩定、德蘇兩軍地位、均無變動、蘇軍防力似較前爲强、據德國軍事專家談稱、高加索小地並無統一陣綫、各軍現正個別作戰、</p>
<p>柏林四日同盟社電　官方宣布、九月一日波寇爾許海峽在塔曼半島登陸之德軍、今日已從東前進之羅軍獲得聯絡、在塔曼牛島被截斷之蘇軍、仍加抵抗、但其軍力並不龐大、</p>

<h3>為抑低物價籌設產銷聯合組織　製造批發零售一致行動　日來商店售價已見抑低</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報　、工部局物品統制處主任稻　今日（四日）向記者概述當局爲抑低物價而刻正加　調查之各種因素、略稱、製造商·此發商與零售商各自成立聯合會、　酊給之計劃、將在一般的穩定上海生活狀况之工作中、佔一重要部份、</p>
<p>批發價格積極調整</p>
<p>日當局最近頒佈之物價統制通告、旨在謀取生活標準之穩定、並指導民衆瞭解與合作、目下當局從事種種研究、莫不儼格遵照近頒之物價統制通告辦理、而工部局之行動、均與日當局合作進行、以目前而言、僅零售商已受統制、故倘須更深刻調香批發商與零售商間交易之價格、對於批發商與零售商間之售價、加以調整、實乃極重要少事、一如製造商與批發商間之售價亦須加以調整然、</p>
<p>考量適當配給計劃</p>
<p>當局爲對製造商售價、加以　當之統制起見、現囑彼等是報製造費用之詳報、然　將蒐集批發商之成本若干加以調查、最後始調查零售商之成本、配給物品之方法、當局亦將加以研究、而考量適當之配給計劃，亦屬必要之舉、俾能發現其缺乏或不足之處、職是之故、製造商。批發商與零售商、均須分別成立聯合會、</p>

<h3>貨物限價　雜糧交易甚稀</h3>
<p>昨日雜糧市况、供稀求少、交易頗淸、良以貨主因到缺未肯輕脫、木街店戶則受抑制物價而乏意進取、故市是互擯、統市祇開崇明沙蠢五十包、價一百卅四元、三鑫小包麩皮七月份棧單三百包、價一百十六元、</p>

<p>游藝界</p>
<h3>如是我聞之宋德珠</h3>
<p>— 病鳩</p>
<p>宋德珠以武旦姿態，蜚聲歌壇，其機緣半仗技藝，半亦人和也。客有詢宋伶身世經歷者，乃草斯文以告之。</p>
<p>學藝經過</p>
<p>宋德珠河北天津人，世業商，迄至其父，家道中落，宋父乃送德珠入戲校，時德珠年僅十二齡，以靑衣開蒙，繼習武旦，迭受九　風，朱桂芳，郭際湘，余玉琴等名師薰陶，藝大成。民國二十六年北平立言報主辦童伶票選，德珠得票最多榮膺武旦冠軍，聲名更噪。當其在校時，副校長李伯言最寵愛之，拔德珠於舉校數百學生之中，教導嚴督，有如已出，且爲之編排新戲「平陽公主」，該劇中之武技，頗多新頴玩意，如「如意雙鈎」之起舞，配以姑蘇水仙及傍妝台等古譜曲牌，古色古杳，悅耳娛目，時人稱之。同時更聘國術家高紫雲教授太極羅漢乾坤對擊劍，此種技術能下苦工，胥有助益於旦角之身段，德珠今日之成就，實基於此。</p>
<p>初次組班</p>
<p>民國二十八年元旦，德珠初次組班演出於北平新新戲院，以武旦挑班，創梨園界之紀錄。劇目爲全部楊排風，其配角陣容，靑衣爲陳盛蓀，王盛意，武生鍾鳴岐，鬚生陸鳳山，武淨蕭德賓趙　勛，武丑殷金振，裏子老生修德新，小生李德彬，大半爲戲校舊人。</p>
<p>出國未成</p>
<p>二十八年美國舊金山舉行金門博覽會，時李伯言仟職海外，頗欲使宋劇團赴美參加表演，爲國家及個人爭光榮，益以旅美華籍電影明星黃柳霜之慫恿，願作經濟上之助益，以是函電往返，接洽已有端倪，但終以人事問題，未能解決，况國家又在多事之秋，雅不欲有所舖張，功敗垂成，彌可惜也。</p>
<p>藝事一斑</p>
<p>宋德珠爲武旦專工，技藝大半受自九隙風，觀　出手之驚險迅捷，頗相類似，所打套子完全，花式繁多，絕少雷同，態度從容不迫，時有美妙之花旦身段參雜其間，婀娜生姿，頗爲可愛。武旦能剛柔兼俱者，德珠實爲第一人。蹺工純屬武旦式，「立」「坡」互有，深含中庸之道，進退如意，美觀絕倫，惜下蹬及站住工夫稍差，打快槍時每能見之，德珠嗓狹唱靑衣戲，尚宜勤加鍛練，否則武旦之外，兼學花旦，未始不能逞雄旦行，藝貴精而不求博，鄙意深以後說爲然也。</p>
<h3>孫劍秋藝事猛晋</h3>
<p>— 海生</p>
<p>美麗坤旦孫劍秋，隸演更新舞台，色藝俱佳，此番宋德珠來申演蝶戀花，美人魚，得意緣，花田錯諸劇，劍秋之合演，殊收組花綠葉，相得益影之妙。劍秋力求深造，沂央名丑慈少泉爲說荷珠配，小放牛諸劇，編劇家翁偶虹對之甚爲讚許許，推爲後起之秀，劍秋日內將拜列名票胡耕雲君門牆爲義女云。</p>
<h3>靑光劇團動態</h3>
<p>— 良人</p>
<p>靑光劇團首次演出「寄生草」曾由馬來華僑鄭歌之導演，博得各界一致好評。現正積極排練七幕哀情文藝名劇「花月佳期」，曲折離奇，新頴非凡，決定中秋節隆山獻演，地點正與某大戲院接洽中。其後緊接五幕熱情歌舞劇「南海戀歌」爲歌之編導，並由華僑舞踊專家鄭里　君及音樂家楊頌平君任歌舞指導，聞該團現有演員仍不敷分酊，如有對於戲劇愛好而稍有經騐者，均可投考參加，函寄大通路一二三號該團接洽。</p>
<h3>薛進在「血淚」中</h3>
<p>— 范石人</p>
<p>提起薜進這名字，好像跟諸位都很生吧？的確，就是不佞在以前也並未耳聞，我發現道位有演劇大才的藝人還是最近的事。在一個明風淸的秋夜，被一位友人邀往璇宮觀未名劇團公演的。血淚二劇，我初次見到了這位優秀而有望的靑年，他在該劇中飾一個風流的匪魁，出現於第二幕中。當他登塲後，滿院的觀衆　立刻鴉雀無聲地靜寂下來，再不像第一二幕那樣煩囂不安，一個個莫不聚精會神地安坐着靜觀，到得意處使來一陣熱烈的掌聲。我不批評台上人的演技是如何細膩傳神，可觀台下人的情緒是否整　被表演者所控制；只要演戲人的神跟看戲人的心膠着，其情有如觸電，這演員的藝事便可承認到了　當的境界了；而一個藝、的全部精靈也便寄在這里，薛進任許多未名的藝人中便是飽孕着這種媚力的一個。</p>
<p>第四幕盜窟被剿的一瞬，是全劇的最高潮，　跟其他優良的演員一樣，很能將高潮的中心點把握住使全塲的空氣始終保持着極度的緊張，於槍聲劈拍中他最後的一個動作是飲彈畢命。慕下時，台上橫滿着屍體，而我的額角也堆滿着汗珠了。</p>
<p>有知道薛進的人說他今年才二十歲，進未名劇團做基本演員還不久。演過的戲有女人心中的王維仁，雷雨中的鄒平，女子公寓中的駱委員，等個性絕對小同的角色，可謂善於演戲的了，而　說劇團的主人却並沒有把他看得十分重要，這種吃虧，也許　基囚於他的年靑境困的緣故吧！</p>
<h3>藝苑動態</h3>
<p>— 一靑</p>
<p>唐槐秋唐彩靑將自皇后期滿　，實踐中國旅行劇團」的名羲，預備大隊人馬門到華北各馳演出。</p>
<p>藝劇團正積極籌　中的　大地　，　請舒適担任導演，舒適尚在考慮中。</p>
<p>蘭心決定今日駇封，院務經地趙朱孫三君，親往檢視一切，待陸露明的「少奶奶的扇子」演畢後，即將正式執行演出權，委由劇壇某某兩君負責進行中。</p>
<p>CZC公司解散後，李健吾巳衣示灰心，無意經營，佐臨所組織的「苦幹」，或有與「華藝」合作的可能性。</p>
<h3>平和義演</h3>
<p>— 海子</p>
<p>今日平和票房假座大舞台爲同仁輔元堂舉行慈善公演，日夜兩塲，臼戲主要劇目爲顧禎祥朱俾茗朱傳芳之「斷橋二陳鼎新之「乾元山」賀松年顧宜翔曹雪芹之打漁殺家。夜塲李元龍詹筱　之「戰長沙」，費席珍顧禎祥之販馬記，及顧宜翔之「捉放曹」，聞銷券認捐L達五六萬元，圖爲顧宜　君便裝小影。</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（八）奈若何</p>
<p>衛雲卿忘了算盤砸在桌子上，咂壞了一個釘子，又砸壞了銅皮，於今叉把算盤提起來拍在桌子上，喝道：一少雲，到底你是我的父親，還是我是你的父親？你說話，怎麼不講理的？我年紀這麼大了，早就想把家政交給你，只看你一味是個浮滑少年的樣子，不大放心。你一不讀書，二不做買賣，不叫你管家裏的事，你倒父管起家裏的事來了。去！給我去唸書，便不唸出聲音來，是看書，看到新年，我再給你幾個錢，至少總是十塊錢，讓你在新年裏樂一樂。」衛少雲聽十塊錢是一個小數目，衛雲卿說十塊錢是一個大數目，兩個人的心理小同，所以衛少雲披一披嘴笑道：「爸爸，你怎麼把十塊錢來誘惑我？我是問你，在我家裏的女人是誰？我耍看一看，你怎麼不給我看？我猜是費長河弄來的女人，也不會漂亮。但是我說的漂亮，水準也並不怎樣高的，只要比你的兒媳婦高明一些，便算漂亮了。」</p>
<p>衛雲卿道：一畜生。說到後來，又不知道說到什麼地方去了。你當做你娶了老婆，我便不能打你，沒有這個話。你惹的我的火冒上來了，我還是會打。忘了嗎？前十年，打折了一根竹竿。去！到你媳婦那裏去！看看她，織的那藍道紅格的布，織多少了。我好好的說話你不聽，你是沒便宜的。秦潤之說了今天來的，算起來要來了，你不聽我的話，給外邊的人知道了，傳出去是笑話。衛少雲昂着頭想了想，把皮鞋在地下頓一頓，往外就走。衛雲卿輕輕的走到門口，看他往那裏走看時，他是往大門外走的，才放了心，又自言自語道，「蠜妻劣子，串關前世。唉！（一七三）</p>

In addition, the other 31 kings on the island are also cooperating with the Japanese army to drive out the Dutch.

In addition, the Soviet troops in the northwestern war zone of the city are currently carrying out desperate counterattacks to prevent the German advance.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - Military authorities revealed that the battle of Stalingrad has entered its final stage from the most intense stage. Stalingrad's guards have been assisting in the battle and are doing their best to defend the city.</p>

Mountain fortresses northwest of Novorossiysk continue to be occupied by our troops. German motor torpedo boats sank three enemy ships with a total of 8,500 tons in the eastern Black Sea. Since the beginning of the Caucasus war, the German Navy has sunk 35,400 tons of Soviet merchant ships. The German offensive on Stalingrad entered the western suburbs of the city yesterday.

Offensives south of Lake Ladoga and on the Leningrad front also failed. The enemy's attempt to cross the Neva River was thwarted, with 20 enemy ships destroyed by our troops.</p>
<h3>Soviet Troops Retreat to New Front Lines in Several Areas of Stalingrad</h3>
<p>Ensk, 4th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - The General Headquarters announced this morning that the Red Army continued to retreat in the southwest of Stalingrad and the northwest of Novorossiysk yesterday.</p>
<p>Sweden Jingcheng, 4th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - The Soviet front lines northwest and southwest of Stalingrad were attacked by 25 divisions of the German army and hundreds of tanks, and were defeated. Soviet troops in several areas are retreating to new front lines. The Soviet Red Star newspaper reported that the intensity of the fighting northwest and southwest of the city, and the large number of soldiers and weapons deployed by both sides, were unprecedented in Soviet battles. Soviet sources admitted that the German forces north of the city were strong, and the number of German troops in several areas in that direction had increased by two or three times yesterday. German troops in several areas in the northwest have broken through the outer defense line of the Soviet army and are currently engaged in fierce fighting. German planes have repeatedly carried out dive bombing attacks over the city of Stalingrad, and Soviet fighter planes have intercepted them, resulting in continuous air battles. The Soviet communique admitted that German tanks and infantry south of the city of Stalingrad had made advances, and Soviet troops in another area were also forced to withdraw to new front lines. The communique also revealed that Soviet troops continued to maintain a defensive posture in the battle of Novorossiysk. German tank troops and motorized infantry, after heavy bombardment by aircraft and artillery, broke into the Soviet positions. It is also reported that German troops have re-entered the Grozny oil fields, but the details are unknown.</p>
<p>Sweden Jingcheng, 4th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - The emergency situation of the German army's general attack on the inner defense line of Stalingrad is increasing. The fighting in the north and west of the city is also very fierce. The Soviet troops are retreating step by step and have to concentrate in a narrower area. According to a Soviet communique, the losses suffered by the German mechanized units have yet to be fully accounted for. It is only known that in one war zone, only six of the 38 German tanks were destroyed. In another area, 11 of the 20 German tanks were overrun. At this point, the number of places where the German army has broken through the inner defense line of Stalingrad is too numerous to count. Military experts today generally believe that the hope of the Soviet troops saving Stalingrad is becoming increasingly slim. Although the defending troops have launched counterattacks in several places, they have been unable to turn the tide. The German side admits that the enemy's resistance is strong and the fighting is brave, but expects that the fall of Stalingrad is only a matter of time. However, they do not believe that the defending troops will surrender suddenly, as there is a precedent of Odessa and Sevastopol. The German offensive in the south of the city has intensified in the past 48 hours, and has captured a mountain after fierce fighting. The mountain is enough to overlook the town of Krasnaya Sloboda. As for the west and north of the city, the Soviet troops' resistance is more effective. As for the other two objectives of the German army, one is the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk, and the other is Grozny in the Caucasus. On the Black Sea front, the German offensive has been hindered by heavy rain and terrain. The Soviet side intends to resupply Novorossiysk by sea, and seems to intend to hold it for a long time. However, whether reinforcements can arrive in time is questionable. On the Grozny front, German infantry and tanks have crossed the Terek River, and the oil area is under direct threat.</p>
<h3>News from the Northwest of Novorossiysk</h3>
<p>Moscow, 3rd (Havas Agency) – The Soviet High Command has issued a war report stating that in the past twenty-four hours, our forces engaged in combat with German troops northwest and southwest of Stalingrad, and northwest of the port of Novorossiysk.

Moscow issued a communiqué for the first time this morning mentioning the fighting northeast of Novorossiysk. German aircraft are continuously bombing the port, and it is expected that a large-scale retreat is currently underway in the area. It appears that there are currently three Soviet divisions in the port of Novorossiysk. The situation on other fronts in the Caucasus is relatively stable. The positions of both German and Soviet forces remain unchanged. Soviet defenses appear to be stronger than before. According to German military experts, there is no unified front in the small Caucasus region, and each army is currently operating independently.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (DNB Agency) – An official announcement stated that German troops who landed on the Taman Peninsula in the Pokrovsky Strait on September 1st have today made contact with Romanian troops advancing from the east. Soviet forces cut off on the Taman Peninsula continue to resist, but their military strength is not significant.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 3rd (Havas Agency) – Today is the 438th day of the German-Soviet war. The pressure on Stalingrad remains as before. German and allied forces are attacking from the north, south, and west, with the front lines about fifteen to twenty-five miles from the city. The Soviet forces west and southwest of the city are in a very dangerous situation. German troops on the northern route have also reached the city of Dubrovka on the banks of the Volga River. However, German supply lines there are frequently attacked by Soviet forces, so the situation is not yet extremely critical. The Soviet side now also acknowledges that the situation in the city is critical, but Soviet resistance is extremely strong. General Timoshenko's counter-offensive in the Kletskaya region continues to keep the German High Command on edge. According to reports received in Berlin today, Stalin left Astrakhan yesterday aboard a gunboat and arrived in Stalingrad today to take command, demonstrating the Soviet determination to defend the city to the end. As for the former region of Rzhev, the Soviet offensive remains very strong. The Soviet side has mobilized a large number of tanks to assist in the battle, suffering heavy losses. However, to date, the Soviet forces have not achieved any significant gains. There have been no major changes on the Caucasus front. The pressure from German and Romanian forces on the port of Novorossiysk continues to increase. The Soviet position is critical. Although they are making every effort to use the terrain to stop the German forces, it is expected that the collapse of their resistance is only a matter of time. There is also fighting in the area of the Terek River in the southeast. It is reported that German troops have crossed the river in the Mozdok area. However, Moscow claims that German troops have not yet been able to establish a bridgehead in the south.</p>

<h3>Establishing Joint Production and Sales Organizations to Suppress Prices</h3>
<h3>Manufacturers, Wholesalers, and Retailers to Act in Concert</h3>
<h3>Shop Prices Have Already Been Reduced Recently</h3>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reports that Mr. Inao, Director of the Industrial Bureau's Commodity Control Office, today (the 4th) outlined to reporters the various factors the authorities are currently investigating to suppress prices, stating that the establishment of associations by manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers will play an important part in the overall effort to stabilize life in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Active Adjustment of Wholesale Prices</p>
<p>The recent price control notice issued by the Japanese authorities aims to stabilize living standards and guide public understanding and cooperation. Currently, the authorities are conducting various studies, all strictly in accordance with the recently issued price control notice, and the actions of the Shanghai Municipal Council are being carried out in cooperation with the Japanese authorities. As it stands, only retailers are subject to control, so it is extremely important to make a more thorough adjustment of the prices of transactions between wholesalers and retailers, and to adjust the sales prices between wholesalers and retailers. Similarly, the sales prices between manufacturers and wholesalers must also be adjusted.</p>
<p>Consideration of Appropriate Rationing Plans</p>
<p>In order to effectively control manufacturers' sales prices, the authorities have now instructed them to submit detailed reports of manufacturing costs. They will also collect information on the costs of wholesalers. Finally, they will investigate the costs of retailers. The authorities will also study methods of rationing goods and considering appropriate rationing plans is also a necessary measure in order to discover shortages or inadequacies. For this reason, manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers must each establish associations separately.</p>
<p>Three Parties Agree on Uniform Prices</p>
<p>And from these three sections, agree on a uniform price, submit it to the authorities for approval, the authorities will refer to the detailed report of the cost of goods, to ensure the establishment of reasonable price levels. There are still several types of retail businesses that are not included in ordinary retailers and will be strictly controlled by the Shanghai Municipal Council to ensure that they maintain reasonable sales prices. The prices of all goods currently controlled by the Japanese authorities may be greatly reduced, and goods shipped to Shanghai from Japan and other places will only be allowed to obtain reasonable profits. Regarding the supply of goods from the interior to Shanghai, he believes that "cheap supply and cheap purchase" can smoothly transport products from the interior to Shanghai. At the same time, there should be greater freedom in the transportation and movement permits for goods.</p>
<p>Shop Prices Have All Fallen</p>
<p>The Datong News Agency reports that the overall economic situation of the city's people has improved as a result of the authorities' active adoption of strict price suppression measures. Major department stores have gradually marked the prices of goods they sell this month to conform to the price limits set by the authorities. The impact of this has caused the prices originally set by other shops in the city to start to waver. The shopkeepers of these stores all expect that in the near future, the authorities will put pressure on the scope of the goods they sell, so they are now eagerly getting rid of their stock, and have slightly reduced prices, so as not to be</p>
<h3>Forcibly Suppressed</h3>
<p>To even lower prices in the future. According to reporters, the Chinese domestic goods company, which was the first in this city to sell goods according to the prices set by the authorities, only reopened at 10 a.m. yesterday, after closing at 11:25 a.m. the day before. Before the company opened the iron gates, there were already over a thousand customers waiting on the sidewalk of the road, and police maintained order and enforced queuing, dividing them into two lines for men and women. The men's line extended to the middle of Shandong Road, while the women's line extended to the bottom of the Cishu Building, and there was not enough space to accommodate them. The crowding situation was</p>
<h3>As Before</h3>
<p>The rice line at the Municipal Council. Then the company opened the side door at ten o'clock, putting a part of the customers in, because the number of people was too large, it closed again after noon and posted a notice in front of the door, "Please come early tomorrow." Other four companies, such as Wing On, were also extremely crowded and adopted the system of putting customers in in batches. Sincere and The Sun Sun also opened a side door all day long and did not close it, but all closed shop before six o'clock.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Police Department Establishes Music Inspection Section</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the Shanghai Municipal Police Department has established a Music Inspection Section to supervise the music played in Shanghai's dance halls and nightclubs. This is the first time in Shanghai's history. Yesterday (the 3rd) afternoon, the leaders of the various bands were summoned to the headquarters of the Police Department, where they were given a list of songs prohibited from being played by the police, and it was stipulated that newly composed songs must be approved by the inspectors before they could be played. The banned songs include the Western songs "America, I Love You," "Thank You, America," "Good Luck and Same to You," and "Georgia Marek." The Chinese songs include "Peach Blossom River" and "When Will You Return?" because their lyrics are inappropriate.</p>
<h3>Counterfeit Foreign Wine</h3>
<p>Xue Ruilin, a Chinese detective of the Criminal Division of the Public Concession Police, recently learned that someone was counterfeiting and selling whiskey. He instructed his officers to contact these people and agreed on a price of 1,800 yuan per dozen. They were to be delivered to the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Dahua Road the day before. When a Suzhou man, Kong Linshu, arrived with a dozen bottles of fake whiskey, he was arrested. After interrogation, he confessed and the police went to No. 11, Lane 46, Chengdu Road, and arrested Zhang Youguang, a Suzhou native, seizing four batches of fake brandy. Then, at No. 353, Aierjin Road, they arrested Wang Yixing, a native of Ningbo, seizing six dozen bottles of Helen Te Whiskey produced by the Fahua Factory at No. 19 Xuhuali Road. After investigation, it was found that they were adding a little black tea to the Helen Te wine and putting it into empty bottles of British whiskey to pass it off as the real thing. As further investigation is required, they were ordered to be temporarily detained pending further investigation.</p>

Recently, Guo took advantage of his position to over-report purchases to the accounting department when buying supplies, embezzling the difference. Over several months, he embezzled approximately 22,400 new yuan. The pharmacy discovered this a few days ago and reported it to the Lao Zha Police Station. Chinese detective Zhou Zhenxing arrested Guo. Guo confessed to the embezzlement, but only admitted to 10,000 yuan. As there was a dispute over the amount, Guo was detained pending investigation and verification of the accounts.</p>

<h3>Mr. Zhao De's Memorial Service Held Yesterday</h3>
<h3>People from All Walks of Life Came to Express Condolences</h3>
<h3>Staff of This Newspaper Held a Public Memorial Ceremony</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the date of the memorial service for Mr. Zhao Dezai, the father of Zhao Youhao, a reporter for this newspaper. People from all walks of life came to express their condolences in an endless stream from morning till night. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Dezai devoted his life to history and geography and the development of education, making contributions to society. His sudden death has caused grief in all circles. Those who went to offer condolences yesterday included elders Shen Enfu, Ding Fubao, Yuan Ludeng, Feng Bingnan, Jiang Weiqiao, Pang Diancai, and other leaders from all walks of life, totaling more than 1,000 people. Eulogies and scrolls were hung on all four walls, all deeply respecting Mr. Zhao's achievements.</p>
<p>At noon, the staff of this newspaper held a public memorial ceremony, presided over by Wang Ziqin, with Lu Yiming and Tang Shichang as assistant officiants. The Banjiang Children's Home first played sad music, presented flowers and wine, and solemnly read the eulogy. The ceremony was solemn and lasted for an hour. In the afternoon, people from all walks of life continued to offer condolences. The entire road on Kuling Road was filled with white horses and elaborate decorations, showing great respect.</p>
<h3>Thinking about the Value of Life from Mr. Zhao's Memorial Service</h3>
<p>Life is originally a journey. Some devote themselves to academia, completing their journey of establishing a career. This is a meaningful and valuable life. Reading the eulogies and couplets from people of all walks of life at Mr. Zhao Dezai's memorial service in Shanghai yesterday, we deeply felt the value of life. Mr. Dezai devoted himself to education and the study of history and geography, and his filial piety and friendship were respected by scholars. He enjoyed a long life and completed his journey of devoting himself to academia. Now, we select excerpts from the condolences from all walks of life to show that although Mr. Zhao's image is gone, his virtue still remains:</p>
<p>Elderly man Shen Enfu (79 years old) couplet: Skilled in history and geography, accomplished in filial piety and kindness, this old man should enter the Confucian biography, worrying about the times when he was ill, and his soul returned to the land of happiness, knowing that he achieved Buddhahood through the Pure Land sect.</p>
<p>Chen Taoyi's eulogy: Living in the empty mountains, writing books to show his ambition, ascending to the land of happiness forever, abandoning his body in peace.</p>
<p>Hu Pu'an's eulogy: Alas, Mr. Zhao, lofty in his aspirations, pure in his body, versed in all the books, knowledgeable and virtuous, living in harmony, teaching his sons with righteousness, treating people with sincerity, but not reaching the age of hope, what is the reason for the heavens? The younger generation looks up to him, and the autumn water is born. Alas, since Mr. Zhao's death, who is the true Confucian?</p>
<p>Feng Bingnan's eulogy written by Qian Chongwei: Venus is dim, and Shao Wei star falls. A philosopher has passed away, and the sound of virtue is lacking. Only Mr. Zhao, in his prime, was famous in the school. Observing the times and judging changes, his eyes were like torches. Seeking practical knowledge, he devoted himself to mathematics and astronomy, and studied geography. He had a thousand years in his heart and recorded them in his writings. Studying the past to verify the present, he wrote a general history. Building a school in Guangling, he held grand lectures, cultivating future generations, with many talented students. He tried his best to serve his parents, cutting his own flesh to treat their illness, moving the gods with his sincerity. His filial piety was a model, his righteous ways taught his sons, and he passed on a clean family, bringing prosperity to his descendants, becoming the essence of the country. Strolling with a cane, he lived in seclusion in the fields, planting flowers and bamboos, searching for mountains and asking questions. Suddenly encountering chaos and hardship, he became ill with worry and abandoned the world. An elder achieved a good end, and his model did not fall. The thoughtful ones are virtuous, shedding tears in the wind.</p>
<p>Jiang Weiqiao's couplet: Skilled in the three fields of learning, using the original principles, nothing is better than history. Four phoenixes in front of the hall, virtuous generations have talented people.</p>
<p>Li Haoran's couplet: Indulging in reading historical records and geography, studying the past and the present. What is the difference between his far-sightedness and Gu Jingfan? Passing on the family is only accumulating learning, inheriting the methods of his predecessors, and future generations will not be ashamed of Hui Songyai.</p>
<p>Du He's couplet: Melting the classics and history, developing learning and nurturing talents, saving the world from chaos, he can be regarded as a pioneer. Filial piety and friendship, cautious in the small and upright in virtue, his pure fragrance will leave a legacy, blessing his descendants.</p>
<p>E Sheng's eulogy: In the past, Xiao Yan wrote a general history. When Jiangling was burned, both civil and military officials were saddened. For thousands of years, only the sound of Dongshui was respected. Mr. Zhao's foresight matched that of his predecessors. He roamed the past and the present, collecting records and weighing changes, uniquely marking new ideas. His son, bearing his father's teachings, reported on current affairs, holding a pen in Shanghai, independent and unyielding, accumulating knowledge and benefiting future generations, encouraging the present world. His high style will last forever.</p>
<p>All the staff of this newspaper couplet: The world has experienced disasters, and the land is full of chaos. Mr. Zhao used Buddhist principles to prove the three vehicles. Let us wait and see for the rosy clouds, and his soul will have a basis to transform. His son's fame is widely known. Heaven does not destroy his filial piety, leaving an old man. Waiting for the Pleiades to set and the moon to fall, his spirit is like a fragrance. If he returns,</p>

<h3>Spotlight on Hong Kong Football Stars (3)</h3>
<p>Versatile Forward Zhuo Shijin</p>
<p>Zhuo Shijin is a versatile forward from Hong Kong, able to use both feet equally well and comfortable in any forward position, hence his reputation for versatility. He comes from the South China Athletic Association, known as the Hong Kong football academy. At the age of eighteen, he became famous on the football field. He was selected as one of the representatives of China's World Games team. At the age of only twenty-two, he was the youngest member of the team.

<h3>Under the Coverage of Buying Sentiment, the Bond Market Becomes a Straight Line</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the unified government bond market was thriving, the market sentiment was strong, and it was exceptionally stable. This was because various banks received a lot of cash, and people's hearts were refreshed. Because the number of chips was rare, it caused short covering, so the rising trend became stronger and stronger. The whole city was covered by buying sentiment, almost becoming a straight line up. Judging from the trend, with the actual receipts of new entrants and large holders, the potential of sellers in terms of chips is slightly inferior. Therefore, for the time being, the buyers are in a better position. In the morning, Hongda, Tongyuan, Shuntai, Qianyi, Xie Kang, etc. first bought in. Although Tongshun, Xin Kang, Lanxin, Runde, Tongyu, Lianhe, Hu Heji, etc. sold hard along the way, it was slightly softer for a while. However, later, due to the needs of Runli, Tongli, and retail investors, it was pulled up. As a result, except for Class A bonds which only rose 7 jiao, the other bonds rose about 1 yuan each. The turnover was about 3 million yuan. The table is listed below.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks at a Loss</h3>
<h3>Except for Department Stores Which Have Turned Around</h3>
<h3>Others are Exhausted as Before</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market was still falling sharply. Only the stocks of the three department stores, Wing On, Sincere, and China National Goods, have rebounded due to excessive declines recently and the activity of bargain hunters. The market has stabilized. Wing On rose 5 jiao, Sincere added 1 yuan, and China National Goods rose 1 yuan and 5 jiao. China Underwear has shown little improvement. Due to news of a fire at the factory this morning, it fell by a huge 1 yuan and 5 jiao. The new pharmaceutical industry was particularly depressed. New Asia plunged by 2 yuan. Sino-French broke through the 70 yuan mark, small 3 yuan and 5 jiao. Minyi fell 1 yuan to 60 yuan. In the cultural industry, only China Bookstore saw stability. The Commerce Press was at a small 7 yuan and 5 jiao. World Book Company was down 5 yuan. In the public utilities sector, Zhabei Water and Electricity was down a small 5 jiao, falling close to the 30 yuan mark. The Chinese market sentiment was stable. The Great China Match Company continued to decline by 2 yuan and 5 jiao. The Nanyang Tobacco Company was down 1 yuan. The new stocks also fell accordingly. Fu Chang Dyeing fell by a small 5 jiao. Great China Weaving and Shanghai Cotton Weaving returned to the previous day's price. As of today, people's hearts are still difficult to stabilize. The turnover was not lonely. The prices of each stock are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabrics and Guang Goods are Uniquely Popular</h3>
<p>The trend of Guang goods and woolen fabrics has been quite popular recently. The supply of raw materials, wool, is cut off, and there is no doubt that the production of factories will inevitably decrease in the future. Therefore, those in the industry with inventory are mostly hoarding and not selling. Also, because the inventory is not large, the retail demand is not weak, and people's hearts are more optimistic. Yesterday, such as fine wool woven medium-thick flower呢, various patterned and plain western-style suit 花呢, ビジ海林棒, 宜維華達呢, 馬褲呢驼叫巾 and the like, were popular in the market, with brisk transactions. The prices are rising, and the demand and supply are still equal.</p>
<h3>Commodity Price Limits - Very Little Grain Trading</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the grain market saw scarce supply and little demand, resulting in very light trading. This was because sellers were unwilling to easily sell due to a lack of inventory, while shops on Muji Street were reluctant to purchase due to price controls. Thus, the market was mutually exclusive. Only 50 bales of Chongming sand silkworm pupae were traded, priced at $134. 300 bales of July futures contracts for Sanxin small package bran were priced at $116.</p>
<h3>Preserved Tangerines Watched Closely</h3>
<p>The preserved tangerines that arrived from the suppliers sold out quickly because the Northern merchants have quite a need for them, and the market was brisk. It is said that the supply of tangerine cakes in the producing areas is already low, so even if telegrams are sent to urge shipment, the number of arrivals will be limited. Therefore, the future market may see further price increases.</p>
<h3>Few Sugar Shares Offered</h3>
<p>Sugar merchant cooperative business office sugar shares, recently because the place has dividends to distribute, so the output is very small, transaction is sparse crude sugar shares of 301 yuan, and a small five corners, the deal four white bags, after the lack of make, raw sugar shares called the original price, no deal.</p>
<h3>Jewelry Gold - Even Inter-Dealer Trading Is Light</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the retail price of jewelry gold at Dasin Jewelers in this city remained unchanged at 2,100 yuan per tael. The buying price was reduced by about 300 yuan. Inter-dealer trading prices fluctuated within a small range, and the trading volume was even lower. Initially, it was 1,877 yuan and 5 jiao, up by one and a half yuan. Then, it was seen at 1,870 yuan. Xiangrong was buying in small amounts, pushing it up by 15 yuan to 1,885 yuan. At noon, it was 1,875 yuan, the same as the previous day's price, with a difference of 15 yuan. Trading was light. Jewelry silver was listed at 14 yuan per tael, and the inter-dealer price was around 11 yuan.</p>
<h3>Military Note Discount Rate - No Change</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the foreign exchange market, the Japanese military notes were flat. The inter-dealer price was about 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, 5 and 7 li, unchanged. As a result, the banks and small money shops sold them at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, and 7 fen and bought them at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, and 5 fen.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate of the Commercial Practice Association remained flat at one jiao and three fen. The new clearing houses are settling cash at par. Five Continents Jiangsu Local Banks.</p>
<p>The Joint Reserve Committee of the banking industry in this city yesterday sent a circular to all exchange banks, stating that the Committee will begin to act as an agent for the exchange of bills of the Five Continents Bank and the Jiangsu Local Bank on September 7, 1942 (next Monday). The exchange number of the Five Continents Bank in the exchange is 52-12, and the exchange number of the Jiangsu Local Bank in the exchange is 52-14.</p>

<h3>As I Heard It: Song Dezhu</h3>
<p>— Sick Dove</p>
<p>Song Dezhu is famous in the opera world as a female martial role, partly because of her skills and partly because of her good relationships. A guest inquired about Song's life experience, so I wrote this article to tell you about it.</p>
<p>Learning Experiences</p>
<p>Song Dezhu is from Tianjin, Hebei. Her family was in business, but by the time of her father, the family fortune had declined. Song's father sent Dezhu to a drama school. At that time, Dezhu was only twelve years old. She started with female lead roles and then studied female martial roles. She was nurtured by famous teachers such as Jiu Jianfeng, Zhu Guifang, Guo Jixiang, and Yu Yuqin, and her skills became great. In 1937, the Beiping Liyan Daily organized a child actors' election, and Dezhu received the most votes and won the female martial role champion, and her reputation became even more loud. When she was in school, Vice Principal Li Boyan loved her the most. He singled Dezhu out from among hundreds of students in the school, and taught and supervised her strictly, as if she were his own daughter, and also choreographed a new play "Princess Pingyang" for her. The martial arts in the play had many new and interesting things, such as the dance of "Ruyi Shuang Gou," which was matched with ancient melodies such as the Suzhou Narcissus and the Beside the Dressing Table. The ancient colors were ancient, and it was pleasant to hear and entertaining to see, and people called it that. At the same time, he also hired national martial artist Gao Ziyun to teach Tai Chi Arhat Qiankun sparring sword. This kind of technology can work hard, and it will help the figure of the female role. Song Dezhu's achievements today are based on this.</p>
<p>First Time Forming a Group</p>
<p>On New Year's Day in 1939, Dezhu formed a group for the first time and performed at the Xin Xin Theater in Beiping, taking the lead as a female martial role, creating a record in the opera world. The repertoire was the entire Yang Paifeng. Her supporting cast included Chen Shengsun and Wang Shengyi as female leads, Zhong Mingqi as a male martial role, Lu Fengshan as a male character with a beard, Xiao Debin and Zhao Xun as martial roles with painted faces, Yin Jinzhen as a martial clown, Xiu Dexin as an old male character, and Li Debin as a young male character. Most of them were former students of the opera school.</p>
<p>Failed to Go Abroad</p>
<p>In 1939, the Golden Gate Exposition was held in San Francisco, USA. At that time, Li Boyan was working overseas and wanted to send the Song troupe to the United States to participate in the performance, to win glory for the country and individuals. In addition, with the encouragement of Chinese-American movie star Anna May Wong, he was willing to provide economic assistance. Therefore, letters and telegrams were exchanged, and negotiations had already begun, but in the end, personnel problems could not be resolved. Moreover, the country was in a time of turmoil, and she did not want to make a show of it. The effort failed, which is a pity.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Artistic Affairs</p>
<p>Song Dezhu is a specialist in female martial roles. Most of her skills were learned from Jiu Jianfeng. The thrilling and swift movements of the audience's shots are quite similar. The set of moves she plays is complete, with many patterns, and rarely the same. Her attitude is calm and unhurried, and there are often beautiful female lead movements interspersed between them, graceful and charming, and very lovely. Dezhu is the first person to be both strong and soft in martial roles. The "standing" and "slope" of the high-soled shoes are mutually available, deeply containing the doctrine of the mean, advancing and retreating as desired, and are beautiful. It is a pity that the skills of going down the stairs and standing still are slightly lacking, and they can often be seen when playing fast guns. Song Dezhu's narrow voice is suitable for singing female lead roles, and she should practice more diligently. Otherwise, in addition to martial roles, she may as well learn flower roles, and she may not be able to show her strength in the role. Art is valued for its excellence rather than its breadth, and I deeply believe that the latter is true.</p>
<h3>Sun Jianqiu's Artistic Achievements Are Rapidly Improving</h3>
<p>— Hai Sheng</p>
<p>Beautiful female lead Sun Jianqiu, who performs at the Gengxin Stage, is excellent in both beauty and art. This time, Song Dezhu came to Shanghai to perform Butterfly Lovers, Mermaid, An Accidental Romance, and Flower Field Wrong. Jianqiu's co-performance is a wonderful combination of green leaves and shadows. Jianqiu strives for further studies. Yi Yang, a famous comedian, told him about He Zhu Pei and Little Shepherd Boy. Playwright Weng Ouhong praised him very much and recommended him as a rising star. Jianqiu will soon be listed as a goddaughter under the tutelage of famous amateur opera singer Hu Gengyun.</p>
<h3>Dynamics of the Qingguang Troupe</h3>
<p>— Liang Ren</p>
<p>The Qingguang Troupe's first performance of "Parasitic Grass" was directed by Zheng Gezhi, an overseas Chinese from Malaysia, and won unanimous praise from all walks of life. It is now actively rehearsing the seven-act sad literary drama "A Good Time for Flowers and Moon", which is tortuous, bizarre, new and extraordinary. It is decided that the Mid-Autumn Festival will be performed at Longshan, and the location is being negotiated with a major theater. Then, the five-act passionate song and dance drama "South China Sea Love Song" was directed by Gezhi, and Zheng Lizhen, a dance expert from overseas Chinese, and musician Yang Songping were the song and dance instructors. It is said that the troupe still does not have enough actors, and those who love drama and have some experience can apply to participate by sending a letter to the troupe at 123 Datong Road.</p>
<h3>Xue Jin in "Blood and Tears"</h3>
<p>— Fan Shiren</p>
<p>Mentioning the name Xue Jin seems to be very unfamiliar to everyone, right? Indeed, even I had not heard of it before. I discovered this artist with great acting talent only recently. On a clear and breezy autumn night, I was invited by a friend to see the premiere of the "Blood and Tears" drama by the Unnamed Troupe at the Xuan Palace. I saw this excellent and promising young man for the first time. He played a romantic bandit leader in the play, appearing in the second act. When he appeared on stage, the audience in the whole theater immediately fell silent, no longer as noisy and restless as in the first and second acts. Everyone sat quietly and attentively, and gave a warm round of applause when they were happy. I don't criticize how delicate and expressive the acting skills of the people on stage are, but I can see whether the emotions of the people off stage are controlled by the performers; as long as the spirit of the actors and the hearts of the audience are intertwined, and the emotion is like an electric shock, then the artist's artistic career can be admitted to a proper state; and all the essence of an artist is also placed here. Xue Jin, among many unknown artists, is one who is full of this kind of charm.</p>
<p>The moment when the bandit's lair was wiped out in the fourth act was the climax of the whole play. Like other excellent actors, he was able to grasp the center of the climax and keep the atmosphere of the whole scene in extreme tension from beginning to end. In the midst of the gunfire, his last action was to drink bullets and die. When the curtain fell, the stage was full of corpses, and my forehead was covered with beads of sweat.</p>
<p>Someone who knows Xue Jin said that he is only twenty years old this year, and he has not been a basic actor in the Unnamed Troupe for long. He has played roles with absolutely different personalities, such as Wang Weiren in A Woman's Heart, Zou Ping in Thunderstorm, and Committee Member Luo in Women's Apartment. He can be said to be good at acting, but it is said that the owner of the troupe does not value him very much. This disadvantage may be based on his youth and poverty!</p>
<h3>Dynamics of the Art Garden</h3>
<p>— One Qing</p>
<p>Tang Huaiqiu and Tang Caiqing will prepare to go to northern China to perform with a large number of people in the name of "China Touring Troupe" after the end of the Huanghou.</p>
<p>The Art Troupe is actively preparing for The Earth. I have invited Shu Shi to be the director, and Shu Shi is still considering it.</p>
<p>Lan Xin decided to seal the building today. Zhao, Zhu, and Sun, the managers of the theater, personally inspected everything. After Lu Luming's "The Young Lady's Fan" is finished, the right to perform will be officially exercised, and two gentlemen from the drama world will be responsible for carrying it out.</p>
<p>After the CZC company was dissolved, Li Jianwu showed discouragement and had no intention of operating it. "Kugan" organized by Zuo Lin may have the possibility of cooperating with "Huayi".</p>
<h3>Peace Charity Performance</h3>
<p>— Hai Zi</p>
<p>Today, the Peace Box Office will hold a charity performance at the Grand Stage for the Tongren Fuyuan Hall. There will be two performances day and night. The main repertoires of the daytime performance are "Broken Bridge" by Gu Zhenxiang, Zhu Biming, and Zhu Chuanfang, "Qianyuan Mountain" by Er Chen Dingxin, and "Fishing and Killing Family" by He Songnian, Gu Yixiang, and Cao Xueqin. The evening performance is "Battle of Changsha" by Li Yuanlong and Zhan Xiaoling, "The Story of the Horse Trader" by Fei Xizhen and Gu Zhenxiang, and "Catching and Releasing Cao" by Gu Yixiang. It is said that sales and donations have reached 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. The picture shows a small casual photo of Mr. Gu Yixiang.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat in Wind and Rain</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(8) What Can Be Done</p>
<p>Wei Yunqing forgot that the abacus hit the table, smashed a nail, and broke the copper skin. Now he picked up the abacus and slapped it on the table again, shouting: "Shao Yun, are you my father or am I your father? Speak, why are you so unreasonable? I'm so old, I've long wanted to hand over the household affairs to you, but I see that you're just a frivolous young man and I'm not very relieved. You don't study, and you don't do business. I don't ask you to take care of the family's affairs, but you're starting to take care of the family's affairs for your father. Go! Go read a book, even if you don't read it out loud, just read, read until the new year, and I'll give you some money, at least ten yuan, so you can have fun in the new year." Wei Shaoyun heard that ten yuan was a small amount, but Wei Yunqing said that ten yuan was a large amount. The two people's psychology was different, so Wei Shaoyun smiled and said, "Dad, why are you using ten yuan to tempt me? I'm asking you, who is the woman in my house? I want to take a look, why won't you let me see? I guess it's the woman that Fei Changhe brought, and she won't be pretty. But the pretty that I'm talking about is not that high of a standard, as long as she's better than your daughter-in-law, then she's pretty."</p>
<p>Wei Yunqing said, "Beast! In the end, I don't know where I'm talking about. You think that just because you married a wife, I can't hit you? There's no such thing. If you make me angry, I'll still hit you. Have you forgotten? Ten years ago, I broke a bamboo pole. Go! Go to your daughter-in-law's place! See how much of the blue-striped red-checkered cloth she's woven. You don't listen to me when I talk nicely, you won't get any benefits. Qin Runzhi said that he's coming today, it's about time he'll be here. If you don't listen to me, and people outside know about it, it'll be a joke." Wei Shaoyun raised his head and thought for a while, stomped his leather shoes on the ground, and walked out. Wei Yunqing walked lightly to the door. When he saw where he was going, he was walking outside the gate, and then he was relieved. He muttered to himself again, "Rebellious wife and wicked son, intertwined in the past life. Sigh! (173)"</p>
