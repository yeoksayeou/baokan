<h3>神秘的埃及（上）</h3>
<p>引言</p>
<p>提起埃及，一般人總是只追想到它過去的一切，至於它近來的狀况，根本就很少知道。近來雖然大家的目光都跟了戰神的足跡也來注意一下，但是所聯想到的也沒有什麽它近年的發展，而無非是些金字塔，人首獅身像，木乃伊，蒙形文字。（Hieroglyphice），以及歷史上著名的拿破崙遠征埃及等等。</p>
<p>實在這種極巳屬陳跡，只能作為大家茶餘酒後的談資而巳。須知埃及已今非昔比，它也早巳受了科舉洗禮，跟着時代而進行着。它也有學校銀行之設立，幣制公債之發行。工商業方面很是發達，在世界上也有相常的地位。像紙烟的出產，更為一般人所熟諗。</p>
<p>本文所要叙述的，當以埃及的近况為王，以期有助於讀者在對於目今戰事之瞭解。</p>
<p>往史的追溯</p>
<p>埃及是西洋文化的發源地，也可以說是全世界文化發源最早的地方。它所以有這般早的開化，當然要歸功於那條尼羅河。那裏氣候溫暖，加之尼羅河有定期的汎濫，所以一切生物生長甚速，而能在距今五千年前巳有了燦爛的史蹟。—有人以為人種也源於此，但未見證實。</p>
<p>大概在公元前三千五百年的時候，埃及已有個國王Menes。他在Memphis地方建都。當時他們已會用大塊的靑石未建築，遺留至今，為各國人仕憑吊的大金字塔，便是用這種有二噸多里的大石造成的。在Memphis一帶，有許多金字塔，普通在像片上見到的是入首獅身像附近的大金字塔，它有五百呎高，比之上海國際飯店還要高上多多。有人佔計，假使要在今日照樣重造一座，至少要十萬工人，並且要十年才能造好，其工程之浩大可見一斑。從這種金字塔看來，當時的人一定深知幾何算術，及建築原理，不然是造不成的。</p>
<p>金字塔實際上是當時王公的墳墓。他們將屍體用極精細的麻皮包裹起來，再用香料藥物將之製成永世不壞之身，隨後裝入金棺中。現在雖相隔數千年，這屍體仍乾皺而不腐，這就是世人所謂木乃伊也。</p>
<p>那人首獅身像是埃及王Khafre的石像，它原是一塊天然岩石而由美術家彫刻成的，所以高大無比，是世界上最大的牛身像。據考測，這石像因了年歲之故，巳陸沉了許多，不然還要高出地面呢。到埃及的人無不來此遊息者；稱雄一世的拿破崙，在他出征埃及時，也曾到此像下念念歌德的「少年維持之煩惱」以自娛。</p>
<p>Memphis在今埃及首都開羅之西，相隔一條尼羅河，所以交通甚便。那裹還有許多古宮遺跡，亦足一觀。</p>
<p>自Menes朝代後，坎及十分興盛，領域逐漸擴張，所佔有尼羅河流域，紅海沿岸。該時文化亦盛，除了建築外，還發明了語音文字，象形字母，文具，年曆等。他們已會造玻璃、疏璃瓦，並會紡織，其布疋之精細和現代之鐵物一般。美術方面有彫刻，圖畫，宗敎方面也有人死後靈魂須受審判的觀念，還有一本「陰間指南」（Livre　pour　les　morts）是給人死後用的。</p>
<p>直到公元前一五八○年，埃及在國王Thutmose三世統領之下，建設了海軍，攻入地中海愛琴海，佔領了無數島嶼，父從蘇彝士地峽攻入亞洲，佔領了阿刺伯之西部一帶。該時埃及國都已遷到尼羅河上游的Hi　Karnak地方，至今還有Thutmose之世建的神廟，其石柱高六七十呎，粗數十圍。廟前還有他自已的石像，其龐大幾與人首獅身像相仿。</p>
<p>但是盛極必衰，這埃及帝國到了公元前一一五○年後，便屢受外人侵侮，為外人所征服了。先後有亞　人，波斯人來犯。及希臘興起，亞力山大的老將Ptolemy到埃及為主，他在尼羅河口三角洲上建了一座亞力山大城，還在港口築了一座高高的亞力山大像，其形式和美國舊金山外口的和平之神像差不多。</p>
<p>Ptolemy將王位傳給子孫承受也經了二三百年。到公元前五十年，才給羅馬帝國的Augustus奪去。</p>
<p>到土耳其Abbas州唐書中所謂阿蒲羅拔是也）朝代，穆罕默德的鏑裔AH的後代，因為反對當這而跑到埃及，趕走了羅馬人，成為Fatima，王朝，至此方建都在開羅。</p>
<p>土耳其人統治了未久，又被一種回敎軍Mamelukes佔領。到了公元一五一七年，再度為土耳其併入其版圖中。</p>

<p>上海內地充分合作</p>
<p>（四）嚴格執行關於新設店號之規例、以防不適宜者經商、並防杜在滬申請營業執照而遭拒絕者赴內地各城巿開設商店、關於此點、為杜絕漏隙起見、上海與內地各城市之日華當局、應保持充分接觸、（五）與日陸軍特務機關保持充分接觸、而上海及內地日方經濟當局與華人常局之間、由特務機關擔任聯絡、俾日當局能詳悉國府各機關所施行之各種統制辦法、上項決議案、將終短期內付諸實施、</p>

<h3>壽丁福保先生</h3>
<p>葷菜吃得愈多愈壞</p>
<p>丁先生是一個忠實的紫食主義者，所以他敢說「輩菜吃得愈多愈壞。」其實，在某一個時期他是極端醉心於肉食的，每大兩頓大菜，還嫌不够，可是身體壞了，民國七年時他受了伍廷芳博士提倡素食的影響，就拋棄了洋盆大菜，茹素節食，到現在快三十僩年頭了。他少而多病，甚疲弱，三歲時息熱病幾死，十六歲時患胃病，嘔吐甚劇，久而始瘥，然益衰弱不堪，見者以為壽不中年，其家死於肺癆病者凡五人，一其嫂二其尊人承祥公，三其妹，四其大小兩侄女，他亦博染而病肺，、當時人壽保險公司不敢為他保險，他從此注重頥養攝生之法，化病弱為健康。後信伍廷芳氏胃腸衛生之說，自民國元年一月一晶起每日於朝餐前灌腸，以免積糞中毒，六年前，開始於每晚添灌一次，這樣胃腸淸滌，延年却病，所以他很自信地說：「我一面注　飲食，一面注重排泄，通便亦可說是長生要訣之一。」</p>
<p>老人家的談鋒越來越健了，他拿手帕把額上的汗珠拭去後，用力地揮動那柄摺扇，如數家珍地繼續解釋長生不老之術。</p>
<p>早睡早起一夫一妻</p>
<p>他像說法的生公，頑石聽了亦會點頭。他主張早睡早起，最好要睡足八小時。夜飯不宜過量。睡時上半夜宜向右側，因胃之下口傾向右邊，使停在胃中的食物，易入十二指腸而向小腸輸送。他認為工作不宜連續數小時而不息，最好每工作三刻鐘，休息一刻鐘，旣可保持康健，又可免除疲倦。他勸吿靑年不應放縱色慾，斵傷精神，一生宜謹守一夫一妻制。他更贊成人家學習靜坐之法，每天在固定時間靜心打坐，集中精神於兩眉之間，不生一念，這樣可使精神灌注不致散漫，辦事效率，可增加百倍·說到這裏，他復引證老子道德經，來說明靜坐功夫的玄秘，同時又大大地發揮了老子「恍矣惚矣，惚矣恍矣」的道理。</p>
<p>有人或許要想像丁先生這樣事由講求衛生的人，一定是非常養尊處優，抱着享樂中義的，可是事實則不然。他有一個可以為人效法的人生觀。什么叫做人生觀？</p>
<p>「什麼叫做人生觀！」他說「人生觀就是講人生底目的。我們要得到這樣一個身體，幷不容易，常然要有一個目的。人生是為吃，為住，為玩嗎？非也！人生是要服務社會，盡已力以救人，有學識的助人的學識，有財力的助人的財力。眞正的快樂，不是享受，而是給予。」</p>
<p>「………………」</p>
<p>「要知道一切功利，富貴，榮耀，權勢都不是自己的。靈魂是自己的。生不帶來，死則帶去的是學問，功德和罪孽。一般人「死要銅鈿」，其實錢多闖禍，許多人家發生家庭兇殺案，不亦是因為錢多賈禍嗎？最好是做做吃吃，安分樂天。因果相尋，「六道輪迥」的圈子是逃不出的」。</p>
<p>一提到「六道輪迴」，就會想到丁先生一定是個佛敎徒。是的，他小僅是一個虔誠的佛、敎徒，還是一個深博的佛學家。他的人生觀，完全是由他的宗敎信仰產生出來的。在四十歲以前，他受了王充論衡的影響，認為一個人「死了死了，一死就了」。叫十一歲時，他方才覺悟到死了以後是不了的。他說了一個故事，雖然內容涉乃怪誕離　，要亦為他趣事之一、</p>
<p>他說：當我四十一歲的時候，鄰家一女，忽得怪病，有三個長毛鬼」附身，這三個鬼操着湖南的口音，他們的說話完全由那病女表達出來。有八知道她附着了鬼，就去買了半個猪頭送祭，不料這三個鬼藉着那個女子的嘴說：「我們弟兄三個人，半隻猪頭怎麼够吃！」於是那家人就接着預備再宰一隻鷄請他們三位貴賓吃，但因為家中無人會宰鷄，，所以拿出去請人家代殺，不料鷄將被拿出門的時候，那個惡鬼附身的女子又開口說「這隻鷄我們要吃的，不准拿出去」。……我以後亦常常經歷到同樣性質的情事，便覺悟人死了以後是不會了的，這樣我就慢慢地踏上信仰佛敎的路。</p>
<p>人間世本是苦惱的</p>
<p>由於他的宗敎信仰，他感覺到人間本是一個苦惱的地方，種種為自己利益而從事的工作中問，毫無絲毫的樂趣存在，人生要回到西方「凈土一才有樂趣可言，不過他和自私自利的念佛老太婆有點不向，他不以個人的往生凈土為已足，他以衆生都能往生凈土才是極樂的世界，所以他並不逃避現實的挑戰，而反極力想普渡這五濁惡世的芸芸衆生，因此養成了他一個服務人羣的人生觀</p>
<p>他認為自已所有的東西贈給別人後方才是自己的。他畢生致力行醫著述以外，喜歡藏書和收集古錢，但他所藏的書和收集的古錢並不藏為私用兼以惠及他人。他曾極感慨地說：「余以中人之產，節縮衣食遊讌嗜好之費，欲買書數十萬卷，其艱難困苦，較富人之搜羅古籍以為美觀者，不可以道里計也……凡人當為社會服役，為有益於人羣之事，不當為自私自利之謀，……每一藏書家，苟能出其所有，予學者以共讀之機會，則必能减少學者之觖望，而免錮藏飼蠢之誚，而其結果，則不僅學者個人受惠無窮，即我國之學術文化，亦必賴以增進，可無疑也」。遵照他的信念，他先後把藏書數萬冊捐入無錫圖書館，前上海市圖書館及震旦大學圖書館等，又創設丁氏圖書館」供人閱覽，他以前亦經表示祇要有人肯捐館址，他願意將他的藏書，全部捐入。他所搜集古錢，積五十年之勞力，蔚為鉅觀他却亳不吝嗇地分捐給各地學校，圖書館及博物院等。他還計劃不久開一個古錢展覽會，門票收人，悉助慈善事業哩！</p>
<p>佛書云：「物施己，是我物；在家者，非我物；物施巳則堅牢；在家者，不堅牢」。丁老深於佛理，故能如此。</p>

<h3>關於梅蘭芳行蹤之謎　關係方面報告確將抵滬</h3>
<p>— 梅花館主</p>
<p>關於梅蘭芳之行蹤，傳者小一，言人人殊，有謂已於上月月杪抵滬者，亦有謂甫於日前到達此間者，更有謂至今仍安居香島實未越雷池一步者，而詢之梅宅僕役，則謂大爺實未嘗蒞此，傳說紛紜，莫衷一是。</p>
<p>上月傅德威在滬時，曾有函致其家中，謂梅氏確已返抵滬上，並曾親見。且言梅因經濟不甚寬裕，勢將重理舊業，　度其粉墨生涯，最近期內，或擬北上一行，俾得與諸舊雨一傾積愫云云。此項消息，沽上新天津畫報，曾以顯著之地位，並用特大標題刊諸報端，其按語有云：「德威家報，當無任何作用，其所言似可置信，惟人事滄桑，瞬息萬變，是否確實可靠，容待事實之證明可也。」按　威為人忠厚，在戲班有好好先生之目，由渠筆底傳出「梅巳抵滬，並會親見」，似屬信而有徵，第與愚所知「梅尙留港」之說，未免相距太甚耳。</p>
<p>前日（二十一日）之夜，遇李祖萊先生（中國銀行襄理）於麗都花園，據伊告余，謂蘭芳確尙在港，日前　有電來，電云：「蘭准十九日乘機飛滬」，惟昨今兩日，未見蒞止，想係颶風交通受阻所致，此間友好，預料二三日內，必可與梅握手於飛機之塲，可斷言也。</p>
<p>按李君固與梅時通音訊者，關於梅之消息，自以李君知之為最詳。爰據其說，寫此短文，以吿讀者。</p>
<h3>「海上大觀園」獻映</h3>
<p>— 一靑</p>
<p>朱石麟處理喜劇的生動在「野花那有家花香」時已給予我們深刻的印象，現在是更進一步的，繼以「海上大觀園」貢獻了。</p>
<p>此片演出的輕鬆，活潑，不但符合喜劇的原則，題材也更廣泛，它是大膽的無情的，暴露人與人間的殘酷，自私。</p>
<p>是這樣的一個故事：講一個門房自從與縫窮婦結合後，省吃儉用，極盡搜括的能事，終至成海上唯一的大地產商，可惜膝下空虛，於是廣收義子義女，不料他們與她們，（他的太太與一位賬房元生都在內）無非都在利用機會博一筆遺產罷了，待到他覺悟已經來不及了。</p>
<p>我們不必說這是在隱射什麽人，反正在上海各階層間，類於這一種故事者，實在是隨時聽到隨地看到的。值得一提的梅熹在「海上大觀園」中演那一位刻薄成家的地產商，不論外形動作，都極維妙畢肖，恰到好處，從此，我們對於梅熹，將重新給予新的評價了。</p>
<h3>梅熹與陸露明</h3>
<h3>馬連良弄璋之喜</h3>
<p>馬連良近在故都演唱，聲譽日隆，秋凉後又有來滬之訊，確否待讀。馬君新舉一雄，昨日適值彌月之喜，其海上友好，紛一致賀，蓋以其多年不育，忽產寗馨兒，想見其伉儷之篤而值得一賀也。</p>
<h3>京戲的新鮮噱頭　共舞臺排演「家」</h3>
<p>— 天衣</p>
<p>趙如泉飾高老太爺</p>
<p>上海的京戲，大概可以分為二大類，一類是京朝大角，循規蹈矩，一類是連台本戲，出盡噱頭。後者以共舞台為此中俊俊，十年來，如火如荼，生意興隆。最近把「白蛇傳」分為前後兩集，什麼眞蛇眞水眞雲眞火，又賣了一個多月的滿堂，上海人愛熱鬧，共舞台有專家研究觀衆口胃，百發百中，道眞是極盡　妙了。不料繼「白蛇傳」之後，共舞台將排演「家」，「家」是巴金的名著，新　公司動員全體明星拍過電影，舞台上的一時俊彥合演過話劇，現在却是共舞台的「角兒」們來演道個「家」，聽說趙如泉決演高老太爺，陳　聲的覺新，李如春的覺慧，陳桂蘭的嗚鳳，王寳蓮的陳姨太，完全時裝登台，不打鑼鼓，話劇作風，不過話劇祗有四五慕戲，他們却有四五十幕，注重佈景，加足穿揷。預料這又是上海人趨之若騖的新鮮噱頭。為了尋幾個鐘頭開心，拉開嘴來笑笑，其實也不妨見識見識。上海的京戲，眞將是「另有一番面目」了。</p>
<h3>郎德山明日登台</h3>
<p>技術家郞德山，頃應友好之請，定於明日（星期日）在大光明登台表演大套技術及魔術，同時新萬花團亦排演嶄新節目，此兩大藝團之合作，一則神通廣大，一則歌舞穠歡，定使觀衆為之眉飛色喜也。</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（七）迅雷</p>
<p>葉二太太把遺囑還了翠珍，吩咐翠珍道：「在什麽地方拿的，還是放在什麼地方，這事，我得想一想，再說話。」翠珍小心翼翼的依舊放在玻璃墊子下，還喜維城沒從雙梅書屋回到房裹去。翠珍發現了這個秘密，也像維城一般憂形於色起來，再偷眼看葉二太太，葉二太太也無心去翻帳簿打算盤了。到了晚上，風依然是怒號，雪沒下，倒是下了一陣雪珠，翠珍在葉二太太房一裏補綴一件舊衣。葉二太太道：「他們都睡了嗎？」翠珍道：「想起來是睡了吧。喜鵲嚷冷，早就想睡了。」二太太道：「你去看城弟睡了沒有，如果沒有睡，你就喚他。我知道他難過極了。」翠珍道：「城弟來了，我還要跟了一塊兒來嗎？」葉二太太道：「也來。」</p>
<p>翠珍奉命去喚維城，她怕維城驚疑，並不突如其來走到他房裹去，只在房外喚道：「城弟，你沒睡嗎？二伯母請你到她房裹去，有話和你說。」維城應道：「就來。」翠珍回到葉二太太房裹，維城也就來了。他勉强笑道：「嬸娘，喚我有什麼事吧？」業二太太星裏，有一張小方桌子，一邊靠著壁，三邊可以坐人。葉二太太翠珍已是分着兩邊坐下，維城就往空着的一邊坐下。葉二太太在燈下對維城一看，越發看出維城是一股憂能傷人的樣子。她先按了按維城的肩胛，說道：「這裹只有我們三個人，沒有外人。你的事我知道了，就是你看到了你媽的遺囑。」維城把嘴一張，要說，說不出什麼來。葉二太太道：「你媽的遺囑，是放在什麽地方的？」維城的眼皮巳經有些潮了，答道：「是在舊書裏檢到的。」　（一三七）</p>

The Japanese forces immediately attacked them.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles on the Ruweisat Ridge: German Artillery Bombards Advancing British Forces; Scale of Fighting in Other Areas Reduced</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 24th (Domei News Agency) - The new battle of El Alamein in Egypt has entered its third day. The most intense fighting in this battle is taking place on the Ruweisat Ridge in the central sector of the Egyptian front, which stretches for ten miles. German forces are rushing large numbers of artillery units to this area to bombard British forces advancing on this position. Conflicting reports indicate that the artillery bombardment from both sides is intensifying and that a major tank battle will soon reach its climax. The scale of fighting in other areas of the front has decreased, reaching a stage of consolidating positions. The central sector is filled with the roar of artillery fire today. German General Rommel has begun to redeploy his mechanized units and truck-borne infantry to counter British forces moving along the edge of the Qattara Depression. Several skirmishes have already occurred between the two sides. Activity is frequent in the desert between the Ruweisat Ridge and the Qattara Depression. On Wednesday night, German and British artillery engaged in a fierce exchange throughout the night. Small units of British infantry and machine gun teams attempted to cross open ground and penetrate German positions. German anti-tank guns opened fire, followed by fierce fighting between tanks and artillery. The attacking British forces were repulsed by the anti-tank guns. Initial reports merely stated, "The battle situation is still unclear." Simultaneously, the fighting in the northern sector has shifted from El Eisa, but the situation remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 24th (Domei News Agency) - British forces on the Egyptian front resumed their offensive on Wednesday night, but on a small scale. German forces are holding their defensive lines, waiting for the enemy to tire. Fighting continued yesterday without major changes. Yesterday morning was limited to artillery duels and sporadic tank and infantry engagements.</p>
<p>Rome, 24th (Haitong News Agency) - This afternoon's Italian military report stated that Italian forces have occupied the Siwa Oasis, southeast of Jaghbub within Egyptian territory. The oasis is one mile wide and twenty miles long and contains the historically famous Temple of Amun and the ruins of the Spring of the Sun.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 24th (Havas News Agency) - According to a London dispatch in the Swiss newspaper "Journal de Genève," although British newspapers are using large headlines to report on the new offensive in Egypt by General Auchinleck, Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East Forces, British officials are remaining silent about the nature of this offensive and its future objectives. The general impression is that the British are attempting to use this offensive to regain the advantage lost by the recent ineffective German offensive. It is generally believed that General Auchinleck is expanding a local offensive. However, the resistance of the Axis forces demonstrates that they are not entirely unprepared and are capable of launching a major offensive towards Alexandria. Therefore, the British objective is to preemptively destroy German preparations.</p>
<p>Rome, 24th (Havas News Agency) - Reports indicate that the commander of the New Zealand forces on the Egyptian front, General Freyberg, has been seriously wounded and has been rushed to the Cairo Military Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Egypt Takes Measures to Protect Its National Interests</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 23rd (Havas News Agency) - According to Cairo reports received from German sources, the Egyptian General Staff has taken decisive steps to protect its national interests. Recently, many British troops stationed in Egypt have been transferred to the El Alamein front for reinforcement. The defense duties they left behind have been immediately taken over by Egyptian troops. For example, railway and highway hubs, as well as bridges and embankments, have all been taken over by Egyptian forces. Even a large part of the Suez Canal area is now guarded by Egyptian troops. Egyptian soldiers have received orders to fire on anyone approaching restricted areas, without stating any exceptions for British troops. According to German sources, this is to prevent the British from implementing a "scorched-earth policy." It is also reported that the King Farouk's Guard has been reorganized recently, significantly increasing its strength. The palace is entirely guarded by Egyptian troops, with no British troops in the vicinity. According to Cairo reports today, the former Secretary-General of the Nationalist Party, Makram Ebeid, recently disagreed with Prime Minister Nahhas and, along with 26 members of his party, was expelled from the party. They have now formed an opposition party.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 24th (Havas News Agency) - Rumors here suggest that if German forces break through the British defense line at El Alamein on the Egyptian front, the Egyptian government will move from Cairo to another location.</p>

<h3>Eden's Speech: Reviewing the War Situation</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 24th (Haitong News Agency) - British Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a speech in Nottingham yesterday, reviewing the war situation and elaborating on the post-war world construction plan. Eden avoided mentioning the second front issue, only stating that the war had reached its peak. He believed that the outcome of the war would be determined on the Eastern Front and in North Africa. Although British forces have suffered repeated defeats, Britain's determination to achieve final victory has not been affected. In terms of social policy, the British government will correct past mistakes, as only a healthy population can build a better world. He hoped that Britain and the United States would continue to cooperate in peacetime.</p>
<h3>Hull Broadcasts to the American People Yesterday</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 24th (Domei News Agency) - According to reports from Washington, Secretary of State Hull broadcast to the nation on the evening of the 23rd, frankly explaining that the current US military operations are due to the United States and other democratic nations neglecting military preparedness for their own interests. He urged Americans to rise up in time and face the difficulties together. The main points of his speech are summarized as follows: (1) It is common throughout history that those who fight for freedom often neglect to defend their freedom after obtaining freedom and valuable privileges, and only realize that they are unprepared when they are suddenly attacked by new threats. (2) The United States and the United Nations are forced to fight due to being attacked because they have forgotten many lessons from history. (3) Since the last major war, the United States and many countries have sacrificed collective security guarantee systems for their own interests, neglecting to provide equal opportunities to all countries, leading to political suspicion and competition in arms expansion, and causing panic in the world after the economic countries fall into poverty. Emerging forces then take advantage of the situation, and the entire world is enveloped in the smell of gunpowder. (4) The United States, starting with the attack on Pearl Harbor last December, has been attacked by the three Axis powers of Japan, Germany, and Italy. The Axis powers believe that they must suppress the United States in order to achieve victory. (5) We must know that merely repelling attacks on the US border is not the same as winning this war. In this war, the tasks of every citizen are extremely important. You must not be discouraged by temporary defeats. It is essential to know that achieving final victory depends on every citizen of the United Nations sacrificing everything to obtain it.</p>

<p>Berlin, 23rd (Domei News Agency) - According to a report from the German News Agency, the Indian National Congress Party's anti-British movement has rapidly intensified, causing extreme instability in the Northwest Indian region, the birthplace of the anti-British movement, and increasing the possibility of an outbreak of riots. The Northwest Frontier Police Minister, detecting this situation, requested the Indian government to urgently send more police officers. Seven thousand police officers have already been dispatched from New Delhi to that area. The Indian government also plans to transport 13,500 guns to the Northwest Frontier, of which 10,000 will be distributed to pro-British local natives.</p>

<h3>German High Command Announces Occupation of Rostov; Volga-Caucasus Battle Begins; Moscow's Situation Also Becomes Critical</h3>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Haitong News Agency Urgent Dispatch) - The German High Command issued a special communiqué stating, "Our forces have occupied Rostov."</p>
<p>Führer Headquarters, 24th (Haitong News Agency) - This afternoon's German war report stated that German aircraft assisted German and Slovak troops in breaking through the strong enemy defenses of Rostov and occupying the city. The remaining enemy forces in the city are being cleared. In the Don River area, our infantry and mechanized units destroyed newly arrived Soviet reinforcements, destroying 69 tanks and 29 artillery pieces. Strong enemy forces northwest of Voronezh attacked several times but were repulsed. Our fighter planes and dive bombers aided the army in inflicting heavy casualties on enemy troops. The enemy suffered heavy losses. In the Volga and Leningrad areas, enemy forces attacked repeatedly without success. Enemy forces preparing to launch a major offensive were dispersed by our artillery fire. In the Arctic region, German aircraft attacked submarines and military facilities in the port of Polyarnoe. Yesterday, the Soviets lost 83 aircraft, and 7 of our aircraft went missing.</p>
<p>Moscow, 24th (Domei News Agency) - It has been publicly acknowledged here that Rostov is in imminent danger. The city is the terminus of four important railroads and is located 13 miles from the mouth of the Don River. The Don River is the only obstacle in front of the Caucasus Mountains. The German offensive is advancing in a semicircular pattern.</p>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Domei News Agency) - According to military news last night, after German forces entered the outer defensive line of Rostov by 20 miles, they deployed on three sides while spearhead units repeatedly penetrated the city. The gateway to the Caucasus appears to be in imminent danger. It is reported that a large Soviet force is preparing to withdraw from the city and head south across the Don River. However, Berlin believes that one of the Don River bridges has already been destroyed, cutting off the Red Army's retreat route. When a small number of troops retreated, they were heavily bombed by German aircraft. Berlin also suggested that German forces have crossed the Don River in large numbers near Tsimlyansk and are advancing south and east along both banks of the Don River. Their main target may not be limited to Rostov. Other German units appear to be targeting Stalingrad, which is reported to be only 35 miles from the Volga River. Thus, the Don River bend is almost entirely under German control.</p>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Haitong News Agency) - German and Slovak troops reached the outskirts of Rostov yesterday. The city is the sixth-largest city in the Soviet Union, with a population of 500,000. Before World War I, it was the most modern city in southern Russia. The city is located on the right bank of the Don River, about 50 kilometers from the mouth of the Don River. It is also an important economic and transportation center for the Soviet Union and has evolved from a commercial center to an industrial city. The railway from the Caucasus and the Caspian Sea to Moscow passes through Rostov, and the oil pipeline from the Caucasus to the Donets River basin also passes through Rostov. The city is the "Gateway to the Caucasus" and is a grain market and shipping center with agricultural machinery factories, automobile factories, tractor factories, shoe factories, aircraft factories, and munitions factories.</p>
<h3>German Forces Determined to Launch All-Out Attack on Stalingrad</h3>
<p>[City name unclear, possibly Bear City] 24th (Domei News Agency) - The path for the German forces advancing in southern Soviet Union to attack the Caucasus is almost open. After the German announcement of the capture of Rostov, their three-pronged offensive has crossed the Don River region and is advancing towards Stalingrad, making an all-out effort to seize this key area and cut off the Caucasus from the rest of the Soviet Union. Stalingrad is a large city on the Volga River that manufactures tanks, munitions, and forging plants. The danger it faces has increased due to the German advance. This point can be substantiated by the statement that German forces have broken through the Soviet resistance in the Don River bend. At the same time, Moscow news has not confirmed the German occupation of Rostov, only stating that the fighting near Novocherkassk (20 miles northeast of Rostov) on the north bank of the Don River is extremely fierce. Moscow news also reports that German forces are attacking in the Tsimlyansk area, indicating that Stalingrad is also threatened in the southwest and that Soviet forces must withdraw or be surrounded.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 23rd (Havas News Agency) - According to Moscow news, the Red Army General Staff announced in today's war report, "Today, the Red Army is fighting hard in the vicinity of Voronezh, Tsimlyansk, Novocherkassk, and Rostov. There have been no major events in other battle areas."</p>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Domei News Agency) - Moscow, Soviet Information Bureau, published the war situation late on the 23rd, stating that Soviet forces had retreated to new positions after fierce fighting in Novocherkassk.</p>
<p>Bucharest, Romania, 23rd (Havas News Agency) - According to a dispatch from the Romanian Rador News Agency's Berlin correspondent, Moscow's situation is critical, and it may be possible for it to fall before Rostov. The German pincer movement is increasingly approaching Moscow, and all railway lines leading to the Russian capital have become useless. Once Moscow falls, not only will the morale of the Red Army be greatly affected, but the communication lines between the Red Army fighting in the various front areas will also be completely cut off. It is obvious that the German authorities do not want to sit idly by and watch the enemy reinforce. The German side believes that attacking the railway center of Moscow is not to be delayed. The fighting in the central and northern areas of the front, though not as magnificent as in the south, is being carried out with the same method and determination. The Red Army General Staff has deployed its forces along the entire line and is advancing according to a meticulously prepared plan.</p>
<h3>Soviets Deploy New Defense Line from Sea of Azov to Caspian Sea</h3>
<p>Soviet border area, 23rd (Havas News Agency) - Today marks the 396th day of the German-Soviet war. The most notable events on the front are the beginning of the battle of the Volga and the battle of the Caucasus. A large German unit in the Stalingrad area is advancing along the Don River, intending to invade the Volga River basin. Another two German units are advancing towards the northern Caucasus. One of them is blocked in front of Rostov, and the other, after crossing the Don River, is advancing south. The aim of the German offensive is to control the railway from Stalingrad through Proletarskaya to the Caucasus, where General Timoshenko seems to have decided to defend Rostov to the death, at any cost. Rostov's role in this war is similar to that of Tobruk in North Africa last year. Most of the city has been destroyed by artillery fire, but the Red Army still holds strong positions and disregards the German invasion of the city's defenses, continuing to hold out for some time. As for the lower reaches of the Don River, there are still two German regiments advancing towards the easternmost point of the river. One of them is advancing east, probably reaching the vicinity of Ostrovyansk, while the other is advancing northeast from Kamensk, seemingly without encountering significant resistance. In addition, General Timoshenko seems to have withdrawn the Red Army in the Donets River basin to avoid encirclement. Timoshenko is also reorganizing troops near the Caucasus, preparing to continue the resistance. His new defense line will run from the Sea of Azov to the Caspian Sea, approximately 300 miles long.</p>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Haitong News Agency) - German authorities said last night that German forces in the lower Don River are continuing to advance fiercely. The vast plains there are extremely suitable for the operations of German mechanized units, so several retreating units have been annihilated. The entire area of the Don River bend is now in German hands. German forces are now only 60 kilometers from the Volga River. German forces in the Voronezh area are continuing to fight defensively. Soviet forces have launched group attacks, but all have been repulsed and have suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 23rd (Havas News Agency) - The Basler Nachrichten newspaper published a Berlin dispatch today stating that, according to the opinions of German military observers, the Red Army in the Don River basin should immediately cease its determined resistance and surrender its arms. However, it is difficult to say how much strength and weaponry the Red Army still possesses. What is known is that all important Soviet strongholds are now under direct threat from German forces. While the Red Army General Staff knew that the Don River would greatly benefit the Red Army's defense, it did not anticipate that a major battle would occur in the south. The German General Staff took advantage of the opportunity as early as last winter to reorganize its forces and prepare to use new weapons in the southern theater. The reason for the current situation lies in this. As for the Red Army's "scorched-earth policy" in the south, German officials commented, "Germany cannot feign benevolence, so the people in the areas destroyed by artillery fire must find their own means of survival. Soviet civilians are undoubtedly victims of the Red Army's barbaric policies. However, no matter how serious the situation, the German General Staff will always prioritize its own troops and continue the war, so it will have no time to deal with the aftermath of the war zone."</p>
<h3>Rapid Harvest Underway in Southern Soviet Regions</h3>
<p>Kuybyshev, 23rd (Domei News Agency) -</p>
<p>The Soviet people have begun a rapid harvest in the Volga River basin and southern regions to avoid being caught off guard by the arrival of German forces. However, it is feared that the harvest in the Volga River basin will be difficult to complete this month. Therefore, not only farmers are busy working in the fields, but also civilians without special jobs and women between the ages of fourteen and fifty have been mobilized to help. Evasion will be severely punished. It is reported that a certain young girl was sentenced to six months of hard labor for this reason.</p>
<h3>Turkish President Inspects Agricultural Areas; Cabinet Strives to Solve Production and Supply Problems</h3>
<p>Constantinople, 23rd, Havas News Agency – President İsmet Inönü personally inspected agricultural areas in central Anatolia. He arrived in Konya today and delivered a speech to local farmers, urging them to work hard to increase production and ensure abundant food supplies for the coming winter.</p>
<p>Constantinople, 23rd, Havas News Agency – Upon assuming office, the primary task of the Sazakoğlu cabinet is reportedly to resolve various issues related to production and supply. The new government's economic policy will be based on a more liberal foundation, especially concerning the vital wheat market. The initial plan involves thoroughly reorganizing most state-owned and public-private wheat trading organizations. The government is reportedly determined to follow France's example in restoring farmers' confidence. Local price control committees will be abolished and replaced by the Ministry of Trade, which will be responsible for all supply matters. These measures have generally been warmly welcomed by the public, as the food problem has become increasingly severe recently, and rampant black market trading has caused widespread anxiety.</p>
<h3>Southern Sweden Bombed Last Night</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 24th, Huitong News Agency – Last night, two unidentified aircraft bombed and set fire to southern Sweden. Two incendiary bombs fell near Solliden Palace on Öland Island, where the King spends his summers. Local soldiers have been deployed in the vicinity. The bomb explosions caused widespread panic, with some people gathering in front of the police station seeking protection, while others rushed into nearby air raid shelters. The atmosphere was tense, and order was disrupted.</p>
<h3>British Houses of Parliament to Adjourn as Usual This Summer; British Government to Propose New Bill to Extend Term of Parliamentarians by Another Year</h3>
<p>London, 23rd, Havas News Agency – Lord Privy Seal Sir Stafford Cripps, the government's representative in the House of Commons, announced today that both houses of Parliament would adjourn as usual this summer. Labor MP Aneurin Bevan immediately expressed indignation and questioned Cripps, "How can the House of Commons consider adjourning at a time when the entire nation is tense due to the government's unclear military intentions? I believe the House should convene a closed-door meeting to discuss the entire war situation." Another MP then asked Deputy Prime Minister Major Clement Attlee whether the United States was represented at the Allied Chiefs of Staff meetings in Britain. Attlee replied that the United States was represented at every meeting, with Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Harold Stark and Commander of the European Theater of Operations General Dwight Eisenhower having attended all important meetings. Former Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin then questioned whether the House was wasting the officials' time by discussing "purely domestic affairs." Deputy Prime Minister Attlee immediately replied, "You are quite right."</p>
<p>London, 23rd, Havas News Agency – Home Secretary Herbert Morrison announced in the House of Commons today that the government would introduce a new resolution in both houses of Parliament, proposing to extend the term of the current parliamentarians again, by one year from this November. The Northern Ireland Parliament will also introduce a bill of a similar nature.</p>
<h3>Italy Releases Indian POWs, Reorganizes Them into Colonial Army</h3>
<p>Bern, 23rd, Havas News Agency – A correspondent for the Neue Zürcher Zeitung in Milan reports that a group of Indian prisoners of war, carefully selected by the Italian military authorities, have been released with the consent of the Italian Foreign Ministry. After swearing allegiance, they have been incorporated into the Italian army and wear Italian colonial army uniforms.</p>
<p>Military Plans Will Never Be Disclosed</p>
<p>Stockholm, 24th, Huitong News Agency – During yesterday's session of the British House of Commons, Labour MP Bevan demanded that the government guarantee the early opening of a Second Front, arguing that the public was eagerly requesting an offensive to aid the Soviet Union, and that British workers were greatly surprised by the lack of effective British aid to the Soviets. Sir Stafford Cripps, representing the government, replied that the government would not disclose military plans. This delicate issue could not be discussed even in a closed-door session of the House of Commons, as the intentions of the military authorities could not be revealed to the 615 members of Parliament. The British government understands the public's wishes, and the public should also understand the unreasonableness of Parliament disclosing military plans.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Urges Britain to Open a Second Front</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 24th, Huitong News Agency – A Swedish correspondent in Britain, Lei, reports that the Soviet Union is constantly increasing pressure on Britain to quickly open a Second Front. Soviet Ambassador Maisky has repeatedly met with Prime Minister Churchill and other members of the War Cabinet to discuss the matter. Soviet pressure is not limited to the activities of the Soviet Ambassador to Britain; the public opinion and mass movements echoing the call for a Second Front, such as the mass meeting in Trafalgar Square on Sunday, may well have been orchestrated by the Soviet Embassy in Britain. From a strategic point of view, launching an offensive in Europe at the present time may not be the best option. It would be best to wait until winter, concentrate all efforts in North Africa, and then launch an offensive in Europe the following year. However, the Soviet Union is currently in a very critical situation, so what Britain and the Soviet Union are currently discussing is whether to launch a Second Front in Western Europe immediately, regardless of the consequences. During yesterday's session of the British House of Commons, Labour MP Bevan demanded a debate on the Second Front issue to dispel public doubts, but Sir Stafford Cripps, representing the government, refused to discuss the matter, arguing that even a closed-door session would be inappropriate, as the matter was of great importance and it would be inappropriate for the 600 members of Parliament to know the details.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 24th, Huitong News Agency – Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky continues to lobby British government officials, urging them to quickly open a Second Front. According to British exchange telecommunications news, Maisky has been extremely busy in recent days, meeting with Churchill, Eden, and British army, navy, and air force leaders. People in London are extremely concerned about the situation in the Soviet Union. Responsible parties point out that the number of Russians now under German control has reached 40 to 50 million. If the German army can advance to the Volga River, the Soviet supply line will face the most serious threat.</p>
<p>Berlin, 24th, Huitong News Agency – Berlin military circles, discussing the Anglo-American attempt to open a Second Front, admit that the German army is waiting for the enemy to attempt an offensive. Whether the enemy wants to attack in a few months, a few weeks, or even a few days, we are ready to deal with them at any time. We have been preparing for a long time.</p>
<h3>Mysterious Egypt (Part 1)</h3>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>When Egypt is mentioned, people generally only recall its past, and rarely know anything about its recent situation. Recently, although everyone's attention has followed in the footsteps of the god of war, what is associated with it is nothing more than the pyramids, the Sphinx, mummies, hieroglyphs, and Napoleon's famous expedition to Egypt, etc.</p>
<p>In fact, these are all relics of the past, and can only serve as topics for conversation after meals. It should be known that Egypt is no longer what it used to be. It has long undergone baptism of scientific development, and is progressing with the times. It has also established schools and banks, and issued currencies and public bonds. The industrial and commercial sectors are very developed, and it has a considerable position in the world. The production of cigarettes, in particular, is well known.</p>
<p>This article will focus on describing the recent situation of Egypt, with the aim of helping readers understand the current war situation.</p>
<p>Tracing the Past</p>
<p>Egypt is the birthplace of Western culture, and can also be said to be the earliest place of cultural origin in the world. Its early civilization is of course due to the Nile River. The climate there is warm, and the Nile River floods regularly, so all living things grow very quickly, and brilliant historical sites have been created as early as 5,000 years ago. — Some people believe that the human race also originated here, but this has not been confirmed.</p>
<p>Around 3500 BC, Egypt already had a king named Menes. He established his capital in Memphis. At that time, they already knew how to use large blocks of bluestone for construction. The Great Pyramid, a legacy that people from all over the world come to commemorate, was built using this kind of large stone weighing more than two tons. There are many pyramids in the Memphis area. The one commonly seen in pictures is the Great Pyramid near the Sphinx, which is 500 feet high, much higher than the Shanghai Park Hotel. Someone has estimated that if it were to be rebuilt today, it would require at least 100,000 workers and ten years to complete, which shows the enormity of the project. Judging from this kind of pyramid, people at that time must have had a deep knowledge of geometry, arithmetic, and architectural principles, otherwise it would not have been possible to build it.</p>
<p>Pyramids were actually the tombs of kings and nobles at that time. They wrapped the corpses with extremely fine hemp skin, and then used spices and medicines to make them imperishable, and then put them in golden coffins. Now, thousands of years later, the corpses are still dry, wrinkled, and incorruptible, which is what the world calls mummies.</p>
<p>The Sphinx is a stone statue of the Egyptian king Khafre. It was originally a natural rock that was carved by artists, so it is extremely large and the largest bovine statue in the world. According to research, the statue has subsided a lot due to its age, otherwise it would be even taller above the ground. Everyone who comes to Egypt comes here to visit; Napoleon, who dominated the world for a while, also went to this statue when he was on an expedition to Egypt, and recited Goethe's "The Sorrows of Young Werther" to amuse himself.</p>
<p>Memphis is located west of Cairo, the current capital of Egypt, separated by the Nile River, so transportation is very convenient. There are also many ancient palace ruins there, which are also worth seeing.</p>
<p>After the Menes dynasty, the kingdom became very prosperous, and its territory gradually expanded, occupying the Nile River basin and the Red Sea coast. Culture was also flourishing at that time. In addition to architecture, they also invented phonetic writing, hieroglyphs, stationery, and calendars. They already knew how to make glass and glazed tiles, and could also spin and weave. The fineness of their fabrics was comparable to modern ironware. In terms of art, there were sculptures and paintings. In terms of religion, there was also the concept that the soul must be judged after death, and there was also a "Book of the Dead" (Livre pour les morts) for use after death.</p>
<p>Until 1580 BC, under the leadership of King Thutmose III, Egypt built a navy, invaded the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas, occupied countless islands, and attacked Asia from the Isthmus of Suez, occupying the western part of Arabia. At that time, the Egyptian capital had been moved to Hi Karnak, upstream of the Nile River. To this day, there is still a temple built during the time of Thutmose, with stone pillars 60 to 70 feet high and dozens of circumferences thick. In front of the temple, there is also a stone statue of himself, whose size is almost the same as the Sphinx.</p>
<p>But prosperity must decline. After 1150 BC, the Egyptian empire was repeatedly invaded and conquered by foreigners. First, the Assyrians and Persians invaded. When Greece rose, Ptolemy, Alexander's old general, went to Egypt to become the ruler. He built the city of Alexandria on the Nile Delta, and also built a tall Alexandria statue in the port, which is similar in shape to the Statue of Peace outside San Francisco, USA.</p>
<p>Ptolemy passed the throne on to his descendants for two or three hundred years. It was not until 50 BC that it was taken away by Augustus of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>During the Abbasid dynasty of the Turkish Tang Dynasty (also known as Abu Lubot), the descendants of Muhammad, the descendant of AH, because they opposed the authorities, ran to Egypt, drove away the Romans, and became the Fatima Dynasty, and from then on established the capital in Cairo.</p>
<p>The Turks ruled for a short time before being occupied by a type of Muslim army, the Mamelukes. In 1517, it was incorporated into the territory of Turkey again.</p>

<h3>Japanese Consulate General Conducts Detailed Study of Price Control Measures; Shanghai and the Interior Adopt Uniform Steps; Strict Control Over All Prices</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the two-day economic conference held in Shanghai under the auspices of the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai has concluded. The Japanese authorities here prepared yesterday (23rd) to cooperate closely with the Nanjing authorities to strictly implement the five resolutions passed at the conference in order to stabilize prices. Well-informed sources attach great importance to this two-day conference.</p>
<p>Strict Control Over All Prices</p>
<p>According to them, this conference is the beginning of a decisive movement to curb rising prices, stabilize the cost of living for the public, and ensure an even distribution of supply and demand. The conference also resolved to control not only basic prices, but also the prices charged by restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and other establishments. The last meeting was held at the Astor House Hotel on Tuesday morning at 10 a.m. and lasted for more than three hours. Representatives from the Japanese consulates in Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Wuhu also attended the meeting to discuss the economic situation in Shanghai and the interior.</p>
<p>Detailed Study of Specific Measures</p>
<p>After the five resolutions on price control were passed, specific measures for implementing the price control regulations were discussed. To facilitate the implementation of these measures, it was unanimously agreed to maintain the closest cooperation with the Nanjing authorities and other price control agencies. This cooperation can adjust the differences between the prices charged by Japanese and Chinese merchants in Shanghai and the interior. According to reports submitted to the conference by representatives from various cities in the interior, the price limit and distribution plans in the interior have been quite successful, especially in Wuhu, where matches, sugar, and several other basic items are sold according to the distribution plan.</p>
<p>Four Important Measures Proposed</p>
<p>Among the many suggestions made at the conference to improve price control, the four most important are as follows: (1) The Japanese authorities in this city should provide statistics to the Japanese authorities in various cities in the interior so that they can calculate wholesale prices; (2) To distribute goods more smoothly to various cities in the interior to meet local needs; (3) All parties should maintain cooperation in order to control prices in the interior; (4) Take concrete steps to control wholesale prices in the interior, as so far the interior has only controlled retail prices and prices for small-scale transactions.</p>
<p>Current System Readjusted</p>
<p>Based on various suggestions, the conference passed resolutions on the following issues: (1) In order to cope with the current needs, the official price limit methods should be readjusted and improved based on the current price limit table system in Shanghai. Therefore, the previously existing price limit tables for various categories of goods should be replaced by price limit tables for all goods, which should be promulgated in Shanghai and various cities in the interior; (2) To give greater legal status to the price marking system implemented in Shanghai in 1940; (3) Invoices must be issued for the sale of goods, and sellers must keep detailed records of all transactions so that the authorities can review them when necessary.</p>
<p>Full Cooperation Between Shanghai and the Interior</p>
<p>(4) Strictly enforce the regulations on the establishment of new stores to prevent unsuitable people from doing business and to prevent those who have been rejected for business licenses in Shanghai from going to various cities in the interior to open shops. In this regard, in order to prevent loopholes, the Japanese and Chinese authorities in Shanghai and various cities in the interior should maintain full contact; (5) Maintain full contact with the Japanese military special service agencies, and the special service agencies will act as liaison between the Japanese economic authorities in Shanghai and the interior and the Chinese authorities, so that the Japanese authorities can know in detail the various control methods implemented by the various agencies of the National Government. The above resolutions will be implemented in the short term.</p>
<h3>Thirty-One Shops in Violation Continue to Be Fined</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department's Intelligence Office announced that in the week ending the 18th of this month, the department's price limit enforcement office sent personnel to investigate 1,138 shops, of which 31 were found to have violated the price limit rules and have been punished separately. A large number of other shops have been ordered to comply with the department's regulations and will not be prosecuted for the time being. In the week from the 11th to the 18th of this month, 124 cases were reported in the French Concession for violating the price management regulations, of which 29 shops were punished for failing to adjust prices in accordance with the authorities' instructions, and the remaining 85 were fined for not marking prices.</p>
<h3>Anonymous Person Donates Large Sum to Public Works Department</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department's Intelligence Office announced that the department's chairman recently received a donation of 50,000 Central Reserve Bank notes to subsidize the Public Concession's Baosjia (neighborhood watch) expenses. The donor wishes to remain anonymous. He is a close friend of the chairman and a supporter of the department. His generous donation demonstrates his enthusiasm for public welfare and is worthy of admiration. The department has accepted the donation and sent a letter of thanks.</p>
<h3>Rice Shops Not Allowed to Force Citizens to Buy Flour</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department's Intelligence Office announced that the department recently issued Announcement No. 6010, stating that when citizens purchase rice from rice shops with rice purchase certificates, they should be free to choose whether or not to purchase flour. If rice shops refuse to sell rice alone, they should immediately report the matter to the police station nearby for investigation and handling.</p>
<h3>Cholera Epidemic in the City Becomes More Rampant; 270 Cases Discovered</h3>
<p>Since the two concessions and the Nanshi, Zhabei, and other Chinese areas have successively reported cases of true cholera, according to the health department authorities, the number of cholera cases has reached as many as 270. The French Municipal Council's Health Department said that the spread of cholera is currently being suppressed. In the first two weeks of July, 157 cases of cholera had been discovered, which led the Tokyo Japan Health Association to recognize Shanghai as a cholera epidemic area. At the same time, the health department authorities said that the total number of cholera cases in the city this year is bound to exceed last year's number of 900. The second cholera vaccination campaign is currently being actively promoted by the health authorities in various districts. However, the health department is not satisfied with the results of the average of 25,000 people vaccinated daily in the two concessions in the past few days. It is reported that between April and May, when the first epidemic prevention campaign began, there were often 65,000 to 75,000 people applying for vaccinations from the health departments of the two concessions every day. True cholera has not disappeared since it occurred in the city. However, the health authorities in the two concessions are actively implementing the second vaccination and are implementing blockade disinfection in the residential areas where infected patients occur at any time, so it is hoped that the disease will not spread and will tend to be eradicated.</p>
<h3>Donations to Education and Orphanage Funds for Ding Shou's Birthday Celebration; More Than 2,000 Yuan Received Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since the news of Mr. Ding Fubao's 69th birthday was published in this newspaper, people from all walks of life have sent congratulatory gifts. Yesterday alone, more than 2,000 yuan was received. It is expected that the number will be quite considerable by Mr. Ding's birthday on August 3. Mr. Ding is determined not to celebrate his birthday, and will donate all the birthday gifts to this newspaper's reader scholarship fund and the Shanghai Fuyou Orphanage. All those who participate in the public celebration will receive a copy of Mr. Ding's book "How to Create My Healthy Life," which is a commemorative book of Mr. Ding's 50 years of writing and living, with rich and valuable content. The list of gentlemen who sent congratulatory gifts yesterday is recorded as follows: Yaoji, 1,000 yuan; Yan Zhichun, 1,000 yuan; Anonymous person, 200 yuan; Yao Zichu, 100 yuan; She Lei, Tong Ruizhong, Ding Bingnan, Huang Ruixiang, Luo Zhijiang, Deng Songying, Lu Guiye, Ying Yongyu, Pu Jiting, 10 yuan each; Li Shoulu, 6 yuan; Luo Hongtao, Zhu Jian, Tong Renxi, Zhang Weichun, Wang Wen , Zhu Zengfu, 5 yuan each; Zhang Jiemin, 3 yuan. The total amount above is 2,429 yuan.</p>
<h3>Bank of China and Bank of Communications Scheduled to Resume Business in Early September; Operating Purely as Commercial Institutions</h3>
<p>This newspaper agency reports from this city that the arrangements for the reopening of the former Chongqing banks, namely the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, by the Sino-Japanese Joint Committee are progressing smoothly. As it stands, these two banks will resume business in early September. Their Shanghai branches have been cleaned up and reorganized, and will cut off relations with Chongqing. It is expected that they will open first, and then the branches in other areas will resume business one after another. At that time, the banks will operate purely as commercial institutions under the leadership of the Central Reserve Bank. Their existing capital will be converted into Central Reserve Bank notes at the official exchange rate of two to one. Therefore, the new capital of the Bank of China will be 20 million Central Reserve Bank notes, half of which will be purchased by the Central Reserve Bank. The capital of the Bank of Communications will be 10 million Central Reserve Bank notes, of which 6 million Central Reserve Bank notes will be purchased by the Central Reserve Bank. It is heard that the candidates for general manager of the two banks have been unofficially decided: Wu Zhenxiu will be the general manager of the Bank of China, and Tang Shoumin will be the general manager of the Bank of Communications. The deputy general manager will be assigned by the Central Reserve Bank.</p>
<p>Central and Farmers Banks Continue Withdrawals</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Central, Chinese, and Farmers Banks were designated by the relevant authorities to have a Japanese bank handle the liquidation, deposits of general depositors in these two banks whose accounts were verified to be non-enemy assets have been returned in two installments. The amount of the first withdrawal was 1,000 Central Reserve Bank notes per household, and the amount of the second withdrawal was 50% of the remaining balance after the first withdrawal. The third withdrawal of the Central Farmers Bank began yesterday (24th), and the withdrawal amount was the entire remaining balance after the first and second withdrawals. This reporter visited the two banks and learned that starting from 10 a.m. yesterday (24th), the withdrawals were quite enthusiastic. Because there was not much remaining deposit amount, it is expected that the withdrawal can be completed within the next week.</p>
<h3>Third Phase of Grain Distribution Ends This Afternoon</h3>
<p>The sale of the third phase of household rice by rice shops in the two concessions will end at 6 p.m. today, and the third rice purchase certificate will also expire from the 26th. It is reported that the fourth phase of rations will be sold by the rice shops starting from the 27th with the fourth rice purchase certificate. The quantity and price will be announced by the Public Works Department on Saturday. It is also learned that the Public Works Department's Grain Management Committee plans to add about two rice shops west of the Hongqiao Road Van Huangdu Railway for grain distribution. This matter is still being investigated to find suitable locations in the area for establishment.</p>
<h3>Landlord Stops Water Supply to Force Tenants to Move Out</h3>
<p>A building at 432 to 4 , and Lane 442 on Beijing Road is owned by the Yuanji Company on North Suzhou Road. Recently, the sub-landlords have been involved in a lawsuit with Yuanji Company due to a lease dispute, which has not been resolved. Unexpectedly, Yuanji Company suddenly stopped supplying tap water to the area a few days ago to force the tenants to move out, which has caused great anxiety to the tenants, including the Daxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Tongchang Silk Shop, Dasheng Silk Shop, Dechang Cotton Cloth Shop, Qingda Silk Shop, Fengyuan Tobacco Shop, Taijin Hardware Shop, Jincheng Wood Shop, Jiangxing Wood Shop, Shishunji Shop, etc. The tenants all use tap water especially for daily drinking, and hygiene and cleanliness also depend on it. If a fire breaks out, it will be even more dangerous. Because the matter is related to public health and social stability, they yesterday submitted a document to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession and other relevant parties, appealing for justice and demanding that the landlord restore the supply of tap water.</p>

<h3>Suzhou Creek to Be Connected for Rickshaws: Merger of Two Rickshaw Associations Planned First</h3>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reports that, according to a press release today (the 24th) from the Tongmenghui [Chinese Revolutionary Alliance], if a plan currently under consideration by the Public Works Department, the Japanese Naval Landing Party, and the Japanese Consulate General is implemented, rickshaws will be able to cross Suzhou Creek directly, similar to how trams are already operating. However, this plan involves technical issues, so its implementation may be delayed. It is understood that the issue involves merging the Shanghai Rickshaw United Association, north of the concession, into the Shanghai Rickshaw Owners United Association, south of the concession, while granting the Public Works Department the authority to manage all rickshaws in the Public Concession. The establishment of two separate rickshaw associations north and south of Suzhou Creek was implemented after the outbreak of the Shanghai War. This inconvenient system is no longer necessary, and the authorities are currently discussing reform measures.</p>
<p>Smooth Negotiations</p>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reports that Matsumoto, the newly appointed Director of the Public Works Department's Traffic Division, told reporters this morning (the 24th) that if negotiations between the Public Works Department and the Japanese Naval Landing Party regarding rickshaw licensing in Hongkou are successful, a considerable sum of money will be returned to the Public Works Department's revenue each year. After five years, the Bureau now intends to have rickshaws in the northern districts of the concession re-apply for Public Works Department licenses. It is estimated that there are currently about two thousand public rickshaws in northern Hongkou, and the license fees will increase the Bureau's revenue. This plan is currently only in the negotiation stage, but progress is quite smooth.</p>
<p>Preliminary Plan</p>
<p>When asked about other plans for Shanghai's traffic, he said that he had only arrived here two months ago and was still unfamiliar with the situation in this city. However, he believes that restoring the normalcy of traffic in Hongkou is a preliminary step in any process. It is noted that Matsumoto was sworn in as Assistant Director of the Traffic Division on July 15th and has now succeeded Mr. Feke as the Director. Feke and 74 other British and American police officers have been dismissed and ceased service on July 31st. Matsumoto was previously a consul at the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai and has also worked in police affairs for a long time.</p>
<h3>Hengmao Lane Landlord Restricts Water Use</h3>
<p>In Hengmao Lane on Mintini Road in this city, the landlord, due to water bill issues, has been threatening to close the main water pipe since a few days ago. The tenants, unable to withstand the pressure, have jointly appealed to the concession authorities to uphold justice. To clarify the truth, the reporter visited the residents of the lane, who said that most of the residents in the lane are on fixed-term leases, with clear stipulations in the lease agreement that water fees are to be borne by the landlord. In May of this year, the Synthetic Real Estate Company's management office notified each household that the water fee would be increased by five cents per month. This was already unexpected. Some tenants, understanding the landlord's difficulties, and considering the amount not large, paid the full amount. Other tenants, based on the lease agreement, were unwilling to pay. Unexpectedly, one wave had barely subsided when another arose. In early June, a notice was issued to all tenants that the water fee would be changed to 13.7 yuan, which, calculated in old legal tender, would be 27.4 yuan. This amount was considered excessive, and they unanimously refused to pay. The landlord, unable to get his way, closed the main water pipe, opening it only three times a day: from 6:30 AM to 8:00 AM, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM, totaling only four and a half hours per day. During this scorching summer, when water usage is high, the coercion is particularly severe, and they had no choice but to appeal to the authorities for a fair resolution. It is said that yesterday, the landlord sent a letter to each household, willing to reduce the 13.7 yuan to 10 yuan. However, the residents still considered the amount too high, and a compromise seems difficult. The general opinion of the residents in the lane is that the tenants and the landlord should each bear a reasonable responsibility. The landlord should not shift all water and electricity costs onto the tenants, and the tenants cannot be completely irresponsible. As long as the amount is reasonable, they are willing to compromise and accept it.</p>

<h3>Mock Terrorist Drill Conducted in the French Concession Yesterday</h3>
<p>The French Concession Police Department conducted a mock terrorist drill at 3:00 PM yesterday on Wangzhi Road. Police officers disguised as terrorists opened fire in front of 105 Wangzhi Road. Upon receiving the news, the police immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to block off Wangzhi Road and nearby roads such as Beile Road and Baiyu Road. Later, after the disguised perpetrators and suspects were apprehended, the blockade was lifted.</p>
<h3>Dancer's Jewelry Stolen</h3>
<p>Tang Mali, a popular Cantonese dancer at the Paramount Ballroom (father's name: Tang Guiyang, residing at 68 Anle Lane, Jing'an Temple Road), did not return home after dancing on the evening of the 22nd of this month. She stayed in Room 6 at the Ingel Hotel at 1222 Avenue Ivanhoe. The next morning at 10:00 AM, she suddenly discovered that a diamond and emerald brooch of considerable value was missing. Unable to find it, she reported it to the Jing'an Temple police station. Detective Yan Bingheng went to investigate. Tan Juanjuan, also a Cantonese dancer at the Paramount Ballroom and a friend of Tang, was also in the room at the time. The detective suspected Tan, but she denied it. After a search, the original brooch was found in her waistband. She was taken back to the police station. After interrogation yesterday, Tan was sentenced to two months imprisonment, suspended for two years.</p>
<h3>Mr. Ding Fubao's Longevity</h3>
<p>The More Vegetarian Food You Eat, the Worse It Is</p>
<p>Mr. Ding is a devoted vegetarian, so he dares to say, "The more vegetarian food you eat, the worse it is." Actually, at one point, he was extremely fond of meat, not even satisfied with two large meat-filled meals a day. But his health deteriorated. In 1918, influenced by Dr. Wu Tingfang's advocacy of vegetarianism, he abandoned Western-style meat feasts and adopted a vegetarian and frugal diet, which he has maintained for nearly thirty years. He was sickly and weak as a child. At the age of three, he nearly died from a fever. At sixteen, he suffered from a severe stomach ailment with intense vomiting, which eventually subsided but left him extremely weak. Observers believed he wouldn't live to middle age. Five members of his family died of tuberculosis: his sister-in-law, his esteemed father Chengxiang Gong, his sister, and his two nieces. He also contracted a lung ailment. At that time, life insurance companies were unwilling to insure him. From then on, he focused on health preservation methods, transforming his weakness into health. Later, believing in Wu Tingfang's theory of gastrointestinal hygiene, he began performing enemas every morning before breakfast in January 1912 to prevent toxin buildup from accumulated feces. Six years ago, he started adding a second enema every evening. This gastrointestinal cleansing prolonged his life and warded off illness. Therefore, he says with great confidence, "I pay attention to both diet and excretion. Regular bowel movements can also be said to be one of the keys to longevity."</p>
<p>The old gentleman's eloquence grew even stronger. He wiped the sweat from his forehead with a handkerchief and vigorously waved his folding fan, continuing to explain the art of immortality as if listing his family treasures.</p>
<p>Early to Bed, Early to Rise, One Husband, One Wife</p>
<p>He was like the monk Seng Zhao preaching, even inanimate rocks would nod in agreement. He advocates going to bed early and waking up early, preferably getting eight hours of sleep. Dinner should not be excessive. When sleeping, the upper half of the body should face the right side, because the stomach's lower opening leans towards the right, making it easier for food to pass from the stomach into the duodenum and then into the small intestine. He believes that it is not advisable to work continuously for several hours without rest. It is best to rest for fifteen minutes after every forty-five minutes of work, which can maintain health and avoid fatigue. He advises young people not to indulge in sexual desires, which harm the spirit, and to adhere to a one-husband-one-wife system throughout life. He also advocates that people learn the practice of meditation, sitting quietly at a fixed time each day, concentrating the mind between the eyebrows, without producing a single thought. This allows the spirit to be focused and not dispersed, increasing work efficiency a hundredfold. At this point, he quoted Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching to explain the mysteries of meditation, and greatly elaborated on Lao Tzu's principle of "dim and obscure, obscure and dim."</p>
<p>Some people may imagine that a person as particular about hygiene as Mr. Ding must live a very pampered life, embracing hedonism. But the reality is not so. He has a worldview that can be emulated. What is a worldview?</p>
<p>"What is a worldview!" he said. "A worldview is about the purpose of life. It is not easy to obtain such a body, so naturally there must be a purpose. Is life for eating, living, and playing? No! Life is for serving society, doing one's best to help others. Those with knowledge use their knowledge to help others, those with wealth use their wealth to help others. True happiness is not enjoyment, but giving."</p>
<p>"………………"</p>
<p>"You must know that all benefits, wealth, glory, power, and influence are not your own. The soul is your own. What you are born with, and what you take with you when you die, is knowledge, merit, and sin. Ordinary people 'die wanting money,' but too much money causes trouble. Don't many family homicides occur because of too much money? It is best to work and eat, and be content and happy. The cycle of cause and effect, the 'six realms of reincarnation,' cannot be escaped."</p>
<p>Mentioning the "six realms of reincarnation" brings to mind that Mr. Ding must be a Buddhist. Yes, he is not only a devout Buddhist but also a deeply learned Buddhist scholar. His worldview arises entirely from his religious beliefs. Before the age of forty, he was influenced by Wang Chong's "Discourses Weighed in the Balance" and believed that when a person "dies, they die, and death is the end." It was not until he was forty-one that he realized that death is not the end. He told a story, though its content may be strange and bizarre, it is still one of his interesting anecdotes.</p>
<p>He said: When I was forty-one years old, a neighbor's daughter suddenly developed a strange illness. She was possessed by three "hairy ghosts" who spoke with a Hunan accent. Their words were expressed entirely through the sick girl. Someone who knew that she was possessed by ghosts went to buy half a pig's head as a sacrifice. Unexpectedly, the three ghosts, through the girl's mouth, said, "How is half a pig's head enough for the three of us brothers to eat!" So the family then prepared to slaughter another chicken to entertain their three esteemed guests. But because no one in the house knew how to slaughter a chicken, they took it out to ask someone to do it for them. Unexpectedly, as the chicken was about to be taken out the door, the girl possessed by the evil spirit opened her mouth again and said, "We want to eat this chicken, don't take it out." ... I have often experienced similar events since then and realized that death is not the end. In this way, I slowly embarked on the path of faith in Buddhism.</p>
<p>The Human World is Fundamentally Suffering</p>
<p>Due to his religious beliefs, he felt that the human world is fundamentally a place of suffering, and there is no joy whatsoever in the work one does for personal gain. Life only becomes joyful when one returns to the Western "Pure Land." However, he is different from selfish and self-serving chanting old women. He is not satisfied with personal rebirth in the Pure Land; he believes that the world will only be truly blissful when all sentient beings can be reborn in the Pure Land. Therefore, he does not escape the challenges of reality but instead tries to save the masses of beings in this defiled world. This has cultivated in him a worldview of serving humanity.</p>
<p>He believes that what he gives to others is what truly belongs to him. In addition to devoting his life to practicing medicine and writing, he likes to collect books and ancient coins, but he does not hoard what he has collected for his own use but shares it with others. He once said with great emotion: "I am a man of moderate wealth, scrimping on food, clothing, entertainment, and hobbies, wanting to buy hundreds of thousands of volumes of books. The difficulty and hardship are incalculable compared to the wealthy who collect ancient books for aesthetic pleasure... Everyone should serve society, do things that benefit humanity, and not engage in selfish pursuits... If every book collector could make their collections available to scholars for communal reading, it would reduce the disappointment of scholars, avoid the criticism of hoarding and neglecting knowledge, and the result would be that not only scholars would benefit immensely, but also our country's academic culture would be enhanced, without a doubt." Following his beliefs, he donated tens of thousands of books to the Wuxi Library, the former Shanghai Municipal Library, and the Aurora University Library, among others, and established the Ding Family Library for public reading. He also expressed that as long as someone would donate a library site, he would donate his entire collection of books. He collected ancient coins for fifty years, amassing a great collection. Yet he generously donated them to schools, libraries, and museums in various places. He also plans to hold an ancient coin exhibition soon, with all ticket revenue going to charity!</p>
<p>Buddhist scriptures say: "What is given away is mine; what is kept at home is not mine; what is given away is secure; what is kept at home is insecure." Old Master Ding understands Buddhist principles deeply, hence he can do this.</p>
<h3>Record of Ms. Gu Mofei's Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>The painter Ms. Gu Mofei will be holding a solo exhibition of her latest works (several dozen pieces) at the Women's Bank Building on Nanjing Road, second floor, from the 25th to the 29th (9:00 AM to 6:00 PM daily). Those in Shanghai who admire Ms. Mofei's poetry and painting are happily ordering her work, creating a situation where her paintings are as sought after as paper in Luoyang [idiom for popular work].</p>
<p>I have long been familiar with Ms. Mofei's clear, remote, and uninhibited painting style. However, in recent years, her work has been imbued with a heroic spirit. Yesterday, I saw her horizontal scroll with craggy peaks gushing like springs, and ancient pines spreading their wings like roc birds, shaping the wind and clouds. The tones of Ms. Gu Mofei in the past were clear and elegant, but now they are clear and majestic. The Huangshan School has been popular recently, which is not without grandeur, but compared to Ms. Gu's work, one only feels that the artistic charm is different. Painters naturally regard artistic charm as the most important thing. If the energy is pure and the charm is pure, then ancient simplicity is acceptable, elegance is acceptable, and heroic wonder is also acceptable. Knowing this is the key to reading Ms. Gu's paintings. Mingshan wrote a poem for Ms. Gu's paintings: "Who is like you in obtaining pure energy? The simple ink reveals the spirit. From now on, I recognize the趣 of Yunlin [Ni Zan]; I do not wish to walk in the general's painting." I think this poem still has some discrepancies. Yunlin captures the spirit with simplicity and remoteness, but Ms. Gu has a clear and splendid quality in her simplicity and remoteness. This is what Yunlin lacks. However, Yunlin's poetic style is indeed clear and splendid. Ms. Gu seems to have combined Yunlin's poetry and painting for her paintings, but her painting is unattainable. Ms. Gu's poems and lyrics have been compiled into volumes, but none have been published yet. Her landscape paintings are particularly outstanding. One line says, "I beg for banana seeds in front of the courtyard, only wanting a clear shade covering half the sky." Ms. Gu once studied painting with Huang Binhong, emphasizing outlines, simple but elegant, simple but abundant. The "begging for seeds in front of the courtyard" line may implicitly indicate the origin of her style, but Ms. Gu has already surpassed Mr. Huang's skill. Although the poem has a self-assured tone, it is actually a modest expression. (Mingshan)</p>
<h3>Tram Avoiding Pedestrian Crashes into and Destroys Two Trees</h3>
<p>At around 9:00 AM yesterday morning, a route 17 trolleybus (number 237) was speeding south on Rue du Père Froc in the French Concession when a local cashier from the Jinhua Coal Ball Company, Zhou Lianrong, was walking in front of the bus. The tram driver swerved sharply to avoid him, but inadvertently ran onto the sidewalk and knocked down a large tree on the side of the road.</p>

<h3>Dye Factories' Greige Fabric Sales Increase, Piece Goods Market Sentiment Rises</h3>
<p>Greige Fabrics: Yesterday, the market saw slightly improved sales, strengthening confidence. All fabrics continued to rise. While trade in coarse and fine fabrics was not particularly brisk, those holding goods were keen to hoard and demand high prices. For example, 16-pound Earth coarse cloth was offered at 184 yuan, and Flying Swan at 180 yuan, but these were unsold offers. 12-pound Earth fine cloth traded at 170 yuan, up 2.5 yuan. New orders for Dapper Rooster &amp; Wealth and Prosperity were rare. Wealth and Prosperity bank orders were bid for at 157 yuan, also up 2 yuan. Magnolia bleached cloth was 170 yuan, Three Sheep Serge 6.35 yuan, Volleyball Poplin 4.10 yuan, and Peach Girl 1226.5 yuan, also up 0.5 yuan.</p>

Colorful Ball fine cloth was 170 yuan, Flying Fish 166 yuan, and Yang He 164.5 yuan, all seeing tightness. Four Gentlemen Serge red orders closed at 7.3 yuan at noon, continuing to rise by 7 cents.

<h3>Cigarette Settlements Boost Military Notes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate at the Bankers' Association remained at 20%, unchanged. The discount rate for new Shanghai bills was discounted by half a cent.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign currency market saw military notes slightly firmer, due to cigarette settlements. Interbank rates were raised by a few cents, calculated at 5.55 yuan. Money changers and silver shops sold at 5.56 yuan, with some requiring 5.565 yuan, and bought at 5.54 and 5.545 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the daily retail price for gold jewelry at the Da Xin Tong Hang jewelry store in this city remained at 2,250 yuan per tael, unchanged (purchase prices were slightly higher, reduced by 300 yuan), slightly converging, due to slightly increased interbank rates. Initially, it was 2,000 yuan per tael, then fell back to 1,970 yuan, and rebounded to 1,995 yuan at noon, 4.5 yuan higher than the previous day, a difference of 30 yuan, with even scarcer transactions. The retail price for silver jewelry remained at 16 yuan per tael, with slightly higher interbank rates at 11.67 yuan.</p>
<h3>Two Banks Join the Exchange</h3>

<h3>Hesitant Investment, Chinese Stocks Prices Remain Low</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market situation remained sluggish, with prices staying low. Investors are still hesitant and waiting for an opportunity to act. However, as soon as low prices are seen, those with significant resources and strength are absorbing large quantities, limiting the extent of the decline. Dasheng Third Factory is moving towards a peak, reaching 238 yuan, rising another 10 yuan. Nanyang Tobacco rose 2.5 yuan, Hanyeping rose 0.5 yuan, New Asia and Minyi rebounded 2 yuan, and the rest remained flat. In the department store industry, Wing On and Sincere were stable, while Shanghai Underwear continued to decline by more than a yuan, showing a softening trend. Zhabei Water &amp; Electricity and China Merchants Electric Power each fell by one yuan. Shanghai Wool Weaving and An Dyeing &amp; Weaving were both flat. There was little demand for financial stocks, so the situation was very stable, and the trading was not deserted. The market price list is further recorded below:</p>
<h3>Bond Market Shows Signs of Life, Scattered Purchases, Market Prices Improve by Several Cents</h3>
<p>The gray market for government bonds showed a slight improvement yesterday. The trends of various bonds have turned around. Although selling from various groups continued, such as Chatay selling about 200,000 of types A and B, and Lianhe selling nearly 200,000 on behalf of a certain money shop, others such as Heng Kang, Xing Zhen, Chang Tong Shun also sold a lot. However, the market price was still relatively strong. Tongli made purchases on behalf of others, and the volume was not weak. Tongkang, Tongyuan, Xinfeng, Xinhua, and scattered purchasers were also able to counter the selling pressure. At the close, there was still demand. It seems that people's sentiment has slightly changed, and as a result, market prices uniformly rose by 0.10 to 0.50 yuan. The transaction volume was about 800,000 to 900,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below.</p>
<h3>New Lead Wire: Shortage of Goods and Firm Prices</h3>
<p>The circulation of new lead wire in the market has recently been quite tight. It has been found that the source of goods was cut off early, and the stock in this port is also thin. As a result, after daily searches, the market goods are becoming increasingly scarce. There is concern about shortages soon. In recent days, there has been a surge of inquiries in the market, and purchases have also increased. As a result, the market situation is very firm, and the atmosphere is enthusiastic. The asking price is greatly affected by the shortage of colors and is extremely high. Currently, colors from number 8 to number 15 are selling for 22,000 yuan per ton, colors from number 16 to number 20 are selling for 24,000 yuan per ton, and colors from number 21 to number 25 are being quoted at 27,000 yuan per ton. The single pick of number 25 fine color is even more scarce, and the market price may not stop there, and some are even selling for 30,000 yuan per ton. In addition, sales of other goods are scarce due to high prices, such as 2,000-pound black iron billets, which sell for 16,000 yuan per ton, and white lead wire, which also requires 16,000 yuan per ton. New plate numbers 4, 5, and 6 are 16,000 yuan per ton, and cement steel is 10,500 yuan per ton.</p>
<h3>Publicly Allocated Beans Gradually Supplied, Transactions are Very Dull</h3>
<p>The bean market situation, soybeans and red beans are gradually supplied due to publicly allocated goods, buyers are very rare, tea beans and broad beans, also because the needs of this street are satisfied and there are few purchases, so the transaction is very dull, the entire city only opened more than ten bags of Pinghu soybeans, the price is 187 yuan.</p>
<h3>Bean Cake Holders Support</h3>
<p>Bean cake domestic sales are limited, but the holders still support and refuse to loosen, so the market situation still sees a trend. Yesterday, Lizi bean cake opened 500 pieces of new goods in May, the price was 69 yuan, 1 jiao and 5 fen, Shenji bean cake April Yoshida stack single 500 pieces, the price was 69 yuan, 7 jiao and 5 fen, and Wangu stack single 500 pieces, the price was 64 yuan and 5 fen.</p>

<h3>Chinese Toon Sprouts are Especially Popular in Local Sales</h3>
<p>Chinese toon sprouts, because there have been no arrivals for a long time, market stocks are gradually becoming thin, and it is the summer season, toon sprouts can be cut into thin slices and mixed with tofu, drizzled with sesame oil, a wonderful vegetarian dish that is clean and refreshing, and is a simple food, so local sales are especially popular, now the price of the goods is 400 yuan, the price of the goods is reduced.</p>

<h3>Regarding the Mystery of Mei Lanfang's Whereabouts, Related Parties Report that He Will Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Master of the Plum Blossom Hall</p>
<p>Regarding the whereabouts of Mei Lanfang, there are many rumors and different opinions. Some say that he arrived in Shanghai at the end of last month, while others say that he just arrived here a few days ago. Still others say that he is still living peacefully in Hong Kong and has not taken a step beyond. When asked, the servants of the Mei residence said that the master has not been here at all. The rumors are confusing and there is no consensus.</p>
<p>When Fu Dewei was in Shanghai last month, he sent a letter to his family saying that Mei had indeed returned to Shanghai and that he had seen him in person. He also said that Mei's finances were not very generous and that he would have to resume his old profession, resuming his theatrical career. In the near future, he might go north to express his accumulated feelings to old friends. This news was published prominently in the Shanghai New Tianjin Pictorial with a large headline. The editor's note said: "The news from Dewei's family should be reliable, and what he said seems credible. However, the world is constantly changing, and whether it is really reliable remains to be proven by facts." Dewei is a kind person and is known as a Mr. Nice Guy in the theater troupe. The news that "Mei has arrived in Shanghai and has seen him in person" coming from his pen seems to be credible, but it is too far from what I know, "Mei is still in Hong Kong."</p>
<p>The night before yesterday (the 21st), I met Mr. Li Zulai (Assistant Manager of the Bank of China) at Lido Garden. According to him, Lanfang is indeed still in Hong Kong. A telegram came a few days ago saying: "Lan is scheduled to fly to Shanghai on the 19th." However, he has not arrived in the past two days. It is thought that the hurricane has disrupted transportation. Friends here expect that they will be able to shake hands with Mei at the airport in two or three days. It can be said with certainty.</p>
<p>Li is a frequent correspondent with Mei, and he is the most knowledgeable about Mei's news. Therefore, I have written this short article based on his words to tell the readers.</p>
<h3>"The Grand View Garden on the Sea" Premieres</h3>
<p>— Yiqing</p>
<p>Zhu Shilin's lively handling of comedy gave us a deep impression in "Wildflowers Are Not as Fragrant as Home Flowers." Now it is a further step forward, followed by a contribution of "The Grand View Garden on the Sea".</p>
<p>The performance of this film is easy and lively, which not only conforms to the principles of comedy, but also has a wider range of topics. It is bold and ruthless, exposing the cruelty and selfishness between people.</p>
<p>It is such a story: it tells the story of a gatekeeper who, after marrying a poor seamstress, saves money and tries his best to search, and finally becomes the only big real estate businessman on the sea. Unfortunately, he has no children, so he widely accepts adopted sons and daughters, but they (his wife and a bookkeeper, Yuan Sheng, are included) are only taking advantage of the opportunity to win a fortune. It was too late when he realized it.</p>
<p>We don't have to say who this is alluding to. Anyway, in all walks of life in Shanghai, stories similar to this are really heard and seen anytime and anywhere. It is worth mentioning that Mei Xi plays the stingy real estate businessman in "The Grand View Garden on the Sea". Regardless of his appearance or actions, he is extremely vivid and appropriate. From now on, we will give Mei Xi a new evaluation.</p>
<h3>Mei Xi and Lu Luming</h3>
<h3>Ma Lianliang is Blessed with a Son</h3>
<p>Ma Lianliang has been singing in the old capital recently and his reputation is growing. After the autumn cools down, there is news that he will come to Shanghai again. It is not certain. Mr. Ma recently had a son, and yesterday was the first month celebration. His friends at sea congratulated him, because he had been infertile for many years and suddenly had a son, which shows the devotion of his couple and deserves congratulations.</p>
<h3>New Gimmicks in Peking Opera, Co-Stage Rehearses "Home"</h3>
<p>— Tianyi</p>
<p>Zhao Ruquan Plays Old Master Gao</p>
<p>Shanghai's Peking Opera can probably be divided into two categories: one is the Peking-style big-name actors, who follow the rules and regulations, and the other is the continuous dramas, which are full of gimmicks. The latter is centered around the Co-Stage, which has been booming for ten years and has a thriving business. Recently, "The Legend of the White Snake" has been divided into two parts, with real snakes, real water, real clouds, and real fire, and has sold out for more than a month. Shanghainese people love excitement, and the Co-Stage has experts who study the audience's tastes and are 100% accurate. It's really wonderful. Unexpectedly, after "The Legend of the White Snake", the Co-Stage will rehearse "Home". "Home" is Ba Jin's famous work. The New China Company mobilized all its stars to make a movie, and the stage's leading figures co-starred in a drama. Now, it is the "actors" of the Co-Stage who are playing the "Home". It is said that Zhao Ruquan will play Old Master Gao, Chen Xiaosheng will play Juexin, Li Ruchun will play Juehui, Chen Guilan will play Mingfeng, and Wang Baolian will play Aunt Chen. They will all appear on stage in modern costumes, without drums and gongs, in a drama style. However, the drama only has four or five acts, but they have forty or fifty acts, focusing on the scenery and adding enough insertions. It is expected that this will be another new gimmick that Shanghainese people will flock to. In order to find a few hours of happiness, open their mouths and laugh, it might be worth seeing. Shanghai's Peking Opera will truly be "a completely different look".</p>
<h3>Lang Deshan Takes the Stage Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Technician Lang Deshan, at the request of friends, is scheduled to perform a large set of techniques and magic at the Grand Theater tomorrow (Sunday). At the same time, the New Kaleidoscope Troupe will also rehearse brand-new programs. The cooperation of these two major art troupes, one with great supernatural powers and the other with joyful singing and dancing, will surely make the audience smile with joy.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat in Storms</h3>
<p>— Hejia Branch</p>
<p>(7) Thunder</p>
<p>Mrs. Ye returned the will to Cuizhen and instructed her: "Put it back where you found it. I need to think about this matter before I speak." Cuizhen carefully put it back under the glass mat, still happy that Weicheng had not returned to the room from the Shuangmei Study. Cuizhen discovered this secret and also looked worried, just like Weicheng. Looking at Mrs. Ye again, Mrs. Ye was no longer in the mood to flip through the account books and plan. In the evening, the wind was still howling, and it didn't snow, but there was a burst of snow pellets. Cuizhen was mending an old piece of clothing in Mrs. Ye's room. Mrs. Ye asked, "Are they all asleep?" Cuizhen said, "I think they're asleep. The magpie shouted cold and wanted to sleep early." Mrs. Ye said, "Go see if Chengdi is asleep. If he's not asleep, call him. I know he's extremely sad." Cuizhen said, "If Chengdi comes, should I come with him?" Mrs. Ye said, "Come too."</p>
<p>Cuizhen was ordered to call Weicheng. She was afraid that Weicheng would be alarmed, so she didn't suddenly go to his room, but only called outside the room, "Chengdi, are you not asleep? Second Aunt asks you to go to her room, she has something to tell you." Weicheng replied, "Coming soon." Cuizhen returned to Mrs. Ye's room, and Weicheng also came. He smiled reluctantly, "Aunt, what do you want me for?" In Mrs. Ye's room, there was a small square table, one side against the wall, and people could sit on three sides. Mrs. Ye and Cuizhen had already sat down on both sides, and Weicheng sat down on the empty side. Mrs. Ye looked at Weicheng under the lamp, and even more saw that Weicheng was a picture of worry that could hurt people. She first pressed Weicheng's shoulders and said, "There are only three of us here, no outsiders. I know your business, that is, you saw your mother's will." Weicheng opened his mouth, wanting to speak, but couldn't say anything. Mrs. Ye said, "Where was your mother's will placed?" Weicheng's eyelids were already a little wet, and he replied, "It was found in an old book." (137)</p>
