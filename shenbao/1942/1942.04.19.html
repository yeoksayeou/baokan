<h3>法政府下令設置　海陸空軍總司令　委達蘭上將充任斯職原有國防部予以撤銷</h3>
<p>維希十八日哈瓦斯社電　　政府頃頒布法令、設置全國海·陸·空·軍總司令、直接受貝當元首之節制、該總司令於涉及其職權範圍以內之問題時、得出席國務會議、至原有之國防部、亦即掌管海陸空三軍軍政之國防部、則予以撤銷、同時內閣總理公署即依據上述法令、任命達蘭海軍上將爲海·陸·空軍總司令、</p>
<p>維希十八日海通社電　法國政府公報刊載新法、一般人咸重視之、第一條規定設海·陸·空軍總司令一員、第二條規定該總司令由元首任命、向元首負責、第三條規定凡閣議討論之問題涉及該總司令之職務者、得列席閣議、第四條賦予該總司令以組織、訓練及遣調本國軍隊之大權、規定政府於聆取其意見後、決定軍隊之給養及武器配備等問題、所有商船、民衆飛機·以及海·陸·空軍之參謀人員、悉受該總司令之節制、將軍之任命昇調、亦由該總司令按照現行法規辦理之、新法之最後一條廢除國防部、</p>
<p>維希十七日哈瓦斯社電　法國新舊內閣交替之際、維希方面空氣頗爲緊張、令人憶及戰前迭次閣潮發生時之景象、奉召組閣之賴伐爾、業於昨日自巴黎返此、當晚即與貝當元首及內閣協理達蘭長談、當賴伐爾與若干政界要人接洽時、原任內閣亦即舉行最後一次會議、全體閣員當向貝當元首提出辭呈、達蘭辭職書中稱、本人決辭去本兼各職、俾鈞座得以採取最適合國家福利之各項決定云云、組織新閣之途徑、因而開啟、一般人原以爲新閣名單發表在即、惟事實上政客及各報記者雖鵑候各官署會客室內、但名單迄今遲遲不發、査內閣此次改組、與數月前一次改組情景大異、蓋前次改組、事前早有綫索可尋、今次改組、則事出兀突、而爲一種絕對秘密決定之結果、顧新閣名單、雖未正式發表、各方揣測則已不一而足、蓋値此困難時期、賴伐爾所物色之閣僚人選如何、關係自屬異常重要、且賴伐爾現與各方所接洽者、不僅決定新閣人選、且將決定法國今後在國際政治中所將採取之政策、至於美國駐法大使李希海軍上將之奉召回國、亦爲時局之一大發展、此事已於本日午後證實、政界人士對於羅斯福總統此項決定、並不表示驚異、蓋觀於美國報紙近日所提倡之反法運動、世人固早已見其端倪、况在目前情形之下、羅斯福總統欲與駐法大使親自面談、亦屬情理之常、抑此間負責方面對於此事迄今拒不評論、可證法政府對於此舉、不欲過分重靦、要之、今後法國外交政策究竟如何、當俟新閣成立之後、始可分曉、</p>
<h3>賴伐爾　內閣名單　昨日下午發表</h3>
<p>維希十八日哈瓦斯社電　賴伐爾內閣名單、或可於今日午後五時左右發表、</p>
<p>維希十八日海通社電　賴伐爾昨日下午未離塞維湼別墅、與貝當元帥及其親信僚屬、研究新政府之名單、消息靈通之政界人士昨稱、賴伐爾担任政府領袖之職、貝當元帥並未十分同意、賴伐爾本人亦無意出任此職、料新政府名單將與貝當元帥之宣言同時發表、蓋所以向世人表示賴伐爾係受貝當元帥之完全信任也、</p>
<p>里斯本十七日同盟社電　據維希來電、賴伐爾定今日或於十八日發表新閣員、施政方針之聲明、亦已起草竣事、該項聲明因鑒於目下法對外關係極呈微妙、是以將集中於內政問題、尤其爲解決糧食問題、獎勵農產以及法軍俘虜等問題、英、美方面通信認爲、賴伐爾擬對軍事、政治各部門根本加以整頓、並傳法政府將遷返巴黎、僅留外交部於維希、</p>
<p>日內瓦十七日哈瓦斯社電　關於法國內閣改組事、此間政界人士現均等待法國官方正式宣布新閣名單、但新聞界已迫不及待、紛紛加以揣測、並私擬一種、「可能的」名單如次、　賴伐爾將任內閣總理兼外交、內政、宜傳三部部長、梅馨將爲外交部次長、馬里翁爲宜傳部次長、伊萊爾爲內政部次長、而全國警務則當由蒲斯蓋處理、　司法部長巴特萊密仍當蟬聯、　陸軍部長一席、以鄧茲將軍與勃利杜將軍二人最有希望、　謝納幹將軍將任航空部長、　奧芳海軍上將將任海軍部長、　財政部長蒲蒂里埃亦將蟬聯、　敎育部長將由法蘭西通儒院會員波那爾担任、　勒洛亞拉杜利將任民食部長、　特拉伽台勒將任勞工部長、　希歇利將任交通部長、　　貝加佛將任國民經濟部長、　　殖民部長貝拉東海軍少將亦將蟬聯、</p>
<p>瑞士京城十八日海通社電　「巴斯勒報」社評今日著稱、法政府改組乃考慮成熟之後所決定、賴伐爾加入內閣後、貝當上將雖不再親自主持內閣會議、但貝當上將之道德感人甚深、故其聲譽不致稍受影響、達蘭雖已退出內閣、但已改任法國海陸空軍總司令、其地位殆已成爲法國軍事之獨裁者、該報相信達蘭當不致利用其職權、將法國艦隊移交予軸心國、或組織法國輔助軍團對蘇作戰、要知達蘭所推行之政策、僅贊同與軸心國在經濟上互相合作、對軍事合作、則表反對、至賴伐爾上台後將如何、吾人敢斷言者、賴伐爾將效力於德、法二國之經濟合作、防範英國侵襲法國、藉使德國在本年夏季、在後方得一安全之保障、甚於此者、當爲賴伐爾亦所不願爲之、若以賴伐爾與葵士林並論、乃屬錯誤之見、賴伐爾入閣後、德國所得者、乃合於現實情形之希望、即增加法國工業供應運至德國、並使德國可無非佔領區內發生特戈爾份子之煽動事件之憂慮、該報繼相信賴伐爾必能利用其巧妙之手腕、避免與盎格魯薩無遜國家發生衝突</p>
<p>維希十七日哈瓦斯社電　賴伐爾息影年餘、東山再起、重握揆席、頗爲舉世所注目、茲將其生平經歷、縷述於后、以備關心法國政局者之參考、查彼得賴伐爾、現年五十九歲、係於一八八三年六月、生於奧凡臬省蒲特陀姆城夏戴桐村中、家境淸寒、幼時在家助父操作、稍長入聖台基埃納中學肄業、旋叉轉學巴育納中學、旋往巴黎、應法一律考試、而於一九〇九年在巴一黎律師公會登記營業、先後任一各工會法律顧問、並迭次代表一工人出庭、一九一四年在巴黎一近郊某鎭、被選爲衆議員、時年三十一歲、政治生涯於是開始、一九二七年當選參議員、一九一三五年又當選連任、此爲渠之議會生活、渠於一九二三年時、一被選爲巴黎附近亞勃維爾城市一長、連任至今、迄未更動、至賴一伐爾之入閣、則始於一九二五一年、初任公共工程部長、並先後在白里安內閣中任次長、在泰狄歐內閣中任司法部長及勞工部長、一九三一年、賴伐爾初任閣揆、直至一九三四年二月六日、始行辭職、厥後杜美格出任總理、組成所謂協調的與諒解的國民內閣、而命賴伐爾先後担任殖民部長及外交部長、一九三五年頃、法國危機四伏、對外關係極度緊張、一時頗有草木皆兵之感、賴伐爾重主揆席、推行果敢政策、以求法國之復興、財政安全及降低生活程度、爲其主要任務、且力求與歐洲各大國之見解及利益相一致、薩爾區公民投票之微妙問題、即係在和平空氣之中、由渠一手解決、而阿比西尼亞戰事期間、法國所遭遇之國際嚴重糾紛、亦因賴伐爾而安全渡過、一九三穴年一月二十日、法國人民陣綫得勢、賴伐爾被逼去職、其時渠仍以參議員資格、繼續在參議院外交委員會中、爲自身主張辯護、一九三九年九月初、渠藉政府要求國會投信任票之機會、反對政府宜戰、翌年初、復在參議院發表演說、對政府作最後警吿、及至法·德停戰協定成立、貝當元首臨政、駐節波爾鐸、即任賴伐爾爲內閣協理、一九四〇年七月、渠代表政府出席在維希召集之國民大會、而使大會決定授予貝當元首全權、按賴伐爾之政策、志在使法、德兩國間誠信相孚、故於一九四〇年十月、促成貝當元首與德國元首希特勒、在蒙都亞鎭所舉行之歷史性的會議、氏旋於數星期後去職、但仍主張法·德妥協及歐洲集團政策、去年八月二十七日、渠在凡爾賽遇刺受傷、入院療治、痊愈以來、益信其個人主張切合實際、距今數星期前、賴伐爾曾以本人所引爲焦慮者、面吿貝當元首、貝當在此種情形之下、授命賴伐爾組閣、以期造福國家、</p>

<p>瑞典京城十八日海通社電　瑞典報紙得倫敦息、倫敦報紙認華盛頓之召回美國駐維希大使李希、為美·法絕交之初步、若美國對法斷絕外交關係後、即將正式承認持戈爾之政府、倫敦方面重視法國政府之改組、即以英國首相邱吉爾準儘發表廣播演說一事足以證明之、</p>

<h3>法艦隊實力</h3>

<p>印度問題專輯</p>
<h3>三往史的追溯（下）　蒙兀兒帝國</h3>
<p>從第八世紀起，回敎即漸次傳入印度，十世紀末年，突厥人在波期東部建立伽色尼朝（Ghafni　Dyuasty），在十一世紀最初三十年問屢次進侵印度。他的勢力遠達恒河流域；不久，同族的廓爾王朝（Ghor　Dynosty）代興，更深入印度內地，掃蕩了彼此爭雄的喇遮菩提（Raiputs）小王國勢力，回敎遂更形深入。這兩百年間就是印度歷史上所謂的回敎王朝。其後廓爾大將庫特布丁（Kutb－nd－din）自立於德里，建立奴隸王朝。據傳十三世紀初年，成吉思汗西征花刺子模時，曾有意進征印度，因爲在鐵門關遇到一個叫做「角端」的怪獸，耶律楚材又乘機進諫，遂中止征印之師。當時適値奴隸王朝的黑暗時代，外侮之來，未必不反能促成印度的進步和統一，而善戰的蒙古人，在熱帶的印度也未必竟能獲逞，從這一點講來，成吉思汗之停少進兵，也許到是印度的不幸。</p>
<p>十四世紀中，蒙古怪傑帖木爾蹶起於中亞，他其實是個突厥人冒稱成吉思汗的後裔。於征服中央亞細亞全境之後，適値印王因强迫臣民信奉回敎，全國大亂，他即於一三九八年由印度邊境渡過印度河。大肆屠殺，在帕尼帕惕（Panipat）大敗印王馬哈木第三（MahmvudⅢ）兵衆，攻陷德里，進兵恒河西岸。旋因小亞細亞方面有事，乃停止征印之兵，印度也表示服從了帖木爾的統治。但是帖木爾的帝國比較成吉思汗帝國瓦解更快，僅僅百年即爲烏茲貝克人（今蘇聯聯邦之一）所滅。他的一個五世孫咱喜兒丁（Yahir－ed－Din），綽號巴卑爾（Baber義爲虎），於國亡之後徬徨無歸，但他却銳意培植實力以謀復國。常他和烏茲貝克人作戰不利之後，便專心經營印度。一五二六年巴卑爾征服印度北部，建都德里，成立蒙兀兒帝國，據說他是一個文武兼長的人物，他用突厥語所寫的自傳，至今還是一部記載從帖木爾帝國到蒙兀兒帝國事蹟的最可寳貴史料。巴卑爾再傳至亞克巴爾（Akbar）他善爲消泯回敎各王國和印度敎各邦的衝突，把他們組織在一個偉大帝國之內，於是印度又一度瑧於興盛。自阿克巴爾以後，兩世紀閒，尙能勉强維持帝國的完整。十八世紀初年。名王奧藍塞布（Aurunyeb）死後，權臣藩王各自攬權，漸成尾大不掉之勢。到英法兩國聞始爭奪印度殖民地時，蒙　兒王雖仍君臨德里，已經是號令不出國門，只有坐視滅亡末運的來臨。</p>
<p>綜上所述，可見印度的致命傷在於內部政權的分立和宗派的紛歧，自從太古時代已經如此。是以縱在文化和宗敎上有你大的成就，最後仍無補於危亡。到最近，已經是印度命運千鈞一髮之時，而其內部這種隔閔猶未宣吿泯減，這正不只是印度自身的不幸而已。</p>
<h3>馬那堪山隘</h3>
<p>當紀元前三二六年，亞力山大進兵印度時，曾經過馬那堪山隘Maiakand　Pass，這裹的佛敎紀念碑至今尙矗立着。此處距Hindu　Kush密邇，即蘇聯與印度交界地也。</p>

<h3>東方的女權國　緬甸女人素描（續）</h3>
<p>有的頭上頂一籮貨物求賣；就是市塲裏也是她們忙着做買賣，望望田間又是她們在耕耘。緬甸男子，犂了田以後，差不多什麽都不管，像挿秧呀！牧穫呀！打穀呀！……沒有」樣責任不放在女人肩上。所以全緬大部分的農產，可說是女人們血汗的結晶！她們的家庭手工業，隨地不同，譬如，教生（Bassein）地方的傘，卜岸的漆器，曼德禮的絲幔等，也都是她們的成績。</p>
<p>絲織業可算是全緬最重要的家庭手工業，亦可算完全女人化，因爲紡織的都是少女少婦；還有全世界著名的緬甸朱律烟，完全是婦女捲成的，就是烟的栽種，一直到捲，切，裝，一層層工作幾何全未經過男子的接觸。</p>
<p>角力鬥歐臨危不懼</p>
<p>總之，無論那一種手工業，女子巳成爲必要工人；在所有經濟活動範圍裏，要是不佔男子上峯，亦不在男子之下。她也能和男子一樣角力鬥毆，她能自衛，也能臨危不懼。</p>
<p>緬甸女人的內心，純潔無暇，一充滿溫柔，和　，愉快，活潑，熱情等素質。她們對於任何勞作，均肯努力苦幹。但未嘗因此放棄及時行樂的機會，如看戲，鬧佛節，玩音樂，跳舞，尤其以跳舞及音樂是她們陶情養性的要素；她比男子還愛看戲，小戲班裏，小丑一言一動，粗野下俗，聽到入微處，還能同男子一樣的瘋狂暴笑；緬甸女人普遍地能歌善舞，而不精於音樂，繪畫和其他的算術，這大槪是時間及習性的關係吧！緬甸女人，因為經濟方面能獨立，所以社交極公開，極自由。</p>
<p>社交方面極為活躍</p>
<p>她們出門時，永遠不肯坐騎動物，就是二輪手車也很少用以代步，她們不肯奇服怪裝，亦不願示人色相。平時，頭，手，脚趾，露出衣裳外，出門時，也不學那波斯人用面帕蒙着她可愛的臉兒，或仿回敎徒以外套隱蔽她美麗綢衣。私人社交方面，她們是極活躍的份子，因爲她們和　可親，善待人接物。就是陌生客誤入家門，入席就坐，亦得享受招待，假使做買賣的人造訪，亦先加以招待後，再講生意經。就是討債人，也不會有兩樣的招待的。</p>
<p>她們的人生哲學，以爲現在活着應完全爲來生的幸福打算；現在沒有什麼重要，來生才是最後的歸宿、，不過目前的努力亦可以幫助將來的享樂，所以她對於集團社交，不甚注意，但對於個人事業，有如歐美婦女對禮拜堂一樣的熱心。</p>
<p>虔誠信仰舊有宗敎</p>
<p>緬甸女人假使不信仰宗敎；虔誠接受那極其神明的吿誡，便空虛到一無所有。她們的風俗習慣，只有靠宗敎而產生；她們的生命受宗敎支配；她們的性情受宗敎薰陶，所以宗敎是她們的一切禮儀，思想，志向，行動的淵源。</p>
<p>雖然緬甸隸英以後，西洋勢力的侵入；仍舊衝不破緬甸婦女的舊社會制度的觀念，或推翻其固有的信心，她們不敢冒險接受新思潮的洗禮，是爲着怕死後落難啊！「不信敎，不是人。」是緬甸男女慣當所勸兒女的活語。</p>
<p>隆重舉行穿耳典禮</p>
<p>女孩一生中，第一件大典是穿耳，叫「D敦敏格拉」（Na　Swin　Mingala）穿了耳，便是她新紀元的開始。從此，她眼裏看每個男性，都是她可能的情人，她出鬥必須有母親，姑母，或已嫁的姊妹當個監護人，每次出門，必須盛裝。</p>
<p>在吉日將臨時，女兒的心裏含着喜懼兩種情緒。懼的是穿耳要挨痛，喜的是不久就得自由了。父母們也認爲這是與男兒爲僧一樣的光榮與喜悅的日子，所以有錢的人，設宴，演戲，奏樂，暗示自家的女兒年已及　，彷彿就是吸引人們注意。有錢人家倩耳匠拿金針（針端有鑽石）在隆重的典禮下穿耳孔，貧苦入家最低限度也要用銀針。此後做耳孔張大的工作，以便帶鑽石挿鮮花。</p>
<p>戀愛過程別有風趣</p>
<p>她的戀愛過程，認眞研究，煞有興趣。在鄕村的習慣，穿了耳洞的姑娘便開始化裝，不久，另　　　子做買賣了。不用說，那生意的最大目的，是選擇夫婿了。此外，汲水的井邊，也是年靑人聚會的　所。</p>
<p>緬甸習俗，男子必須向悅意的女郞，作一度的求婚。求婚時候，不定要花前月下或佳節良宵，通例一律在晚上進行，白天極少。所以緬語中有一句（Loo　HleJhee　AEhain）意即「求婚時候」，用在日常會話裹，代表晚上九句鐘。「早上女人性情兜易怒，日中嘗試易衝突，祇有晚上，是女人最可愛而溫和的時節。」這是緬國一般的經騐之談</p>

<h3>拏藥當飯喫</h3>
<p>本報曾有「改行年」一文，着實抓着養處，但是從鄙人看來，今年不特是行業改變，就是人的生理組織也改變了！不然，爲什麽拿藥當飯吃呢！平常是般闊老因爲飯吃不下，便吃補藥，打補針，現在則老爺少爺太太小姐，只要手邊有幾個現鈔的，就拚命買藥囤積起來。人家說，囤藥是爲的賺錢，那裏當飯吃呢？然而不然。囤藥表面匕固然爲賺錢，實實在在是拿藥當飯吃。因爲囤藥者的心理是這樣的：「米儘貴好了，四百元一石，六百元一石，甚至一千元一石，我也不關心，原來我囤的藥能够同白米的漲價賽跑呢的！」那不是活生生地說拿藥當飯吃嗎？</p>
<p>拿藥當飯吃的風氣的造成，全　　班藥物的經售商，一二萬元的資木會變成幾十萬，那如何不令人眼紅？於是囤藥風氣就此大盛。藥物的經售商最初是莫明共妙地賺錢了一筆錢。因爲太平洋戰事爆發後，船舶少來上海，供求關係不平衡了，於是這般商人睡在床上做了個黃金夢，等到明早起來，藥品漲價，果然慿空多了一大堆鈔票！他們的嘴吧就此永遠落開了。因爲藥品的統制以及運輸的困難，藥品商們試行運藥到內地去，又是大賺錢，於是引起一般外行商人也來做藥生意了，果然也賺錢，於是傳染到老爺太太少爺小妣都做起藥品生意來了。上海人是一窩蜂，你帝樣，我也這樣，囤藥也是一窩蜂，那裏講道理，只要囤藥者所囤的藥物不過二十種，便可知道全然是胡閙，比了猶太人的囤貨方法還差得遠差得遠！　可是幾家藥房的小夥計却拚命要學猶太人，硬勁抬髙藥品價目，　却侵佔了不少人家袋裏的鈔票。現在手腕愈來愈精明，出售藥品價目單，故意低廉，去向他買時，回答說賣完了，其甚者，故意報錯價目，叫人出寃枉電話費，至於徵求藥品價目單呢，也特意提髙，好在要不要，鈔票還在他手裏，你有藥，想照徵求價目賣給他時，他便回答說「我們買足了！如此這般硬把藥價抬髙，更抬髙，在小夥計手裏　票貨色，便從一元變成五六十元了！</p>
<p>有一位吃系念佛的老太太，手邊有十餘萬，眼光倒也不錯，在去年一二八前，拿出五千餘元，買進十萬粒的昆寗丸，可惜命中註定，一二八事變來了！老太太嚇煞哉，趕快要把丸藥　去，東托人，西托人，總算賣去，也沒蝕本，也沒賺錢。最近昆寗丸靠藥房夥計學猶太人，居然大漲而特漲，那位老太太便常常指隔隣一座新落成的洋房說，「要是我的丸藥不賣脫，到令早，這座洋房是我的了，要知道屋價不過十三四萬元，十萬粒的昆寗丸價格現在不止此數呢。」老太太不僅想把藥品當飯吃，並且想造房子造在藥品上了。像此老太太者雖不少，然如今之小夥計們還在一相情願「天下皆窮我獨富啊！</p>
<p>拿藥當飯吃的，讓他拿藥當飯去吃吧。奉勸眞正治病的醫師們，請看穿囤藥者的奸計，勿要開囤貨單裏的藥品吧。　有許多代替某牌的藥物吧，例如吃痢疾肚痛的藥特靈，竟要賣二十餘元一粒，醫師們請諒察一下，我這篇文章寫了這許多，還不値牛粒藥特靈呢。其實中國藥廠有即用藥特靈之粉製劑的，只是牌子不用罷了，請開價廉而能治病的藥品，那眞是感恩不淺了。至於一般人士，也請勿迷信某藥才靈，要知道譬如治傷風咳嗽的藥不止一種，「必靈」的倒也未「必靈」，何苦一定要出六十多塊錢去買一支呢其他藥品，也有廉價品可代的啊。總之，不必迷信某一牌子，只要是眞能治病的藥就好，這樣一來，那末以藥爲飯吃的囤貨單上至少要减少一半。（甘草）</p>

<p>家庭</p>
<h3>夫妻互相不滿意的地方</h3>
<p>— 月下人</p>
<p>每一對夫婦中的一方常會對於另一方感到不能滿意。其原因很多，現在且根據一本外國雜誌上所羅列的相互不滿意點，依着其嚴重性的次序寫在下面。讓我們在祝福「願天下有情人都成眷屬」之外，再願犬下姻緣都美滿吧！</p>
<p>丈夫對妻子的不滿意處：</p>
<p>如無理的要求；缺少情感；自私心太重；太多的實備；干涉丈夫的嗜好；外觀不整潔；易於發脾氣；干涉丈夫的計劃與事業，自大；不眞摯；太容易發怒；太喜批評；器量窄狹；忽略兒童；不善處理家事；太會爭吵；有惡習慣；不忠實；對於小孩溺愛；不善理財；親戚太多；進款不足等等。</p>
<p>妻子對丈夫的不滿意處：</p>
<p>如自私自利；事業無成；不誠實；太多的責備；不顯示情感；談話不能開誠佈公；對待兒童粗暴太甚；性情急躁；對兒童不感樂趣；對家事毫無樂趣；無情感；；粗魯；無志氣；神經質或不能忍耐；批評太多；不善理財；器量過小；不忠實；懶惰；愛談話；親戚太多：容易被人說動；經濟太緊等等。</p>
<p>我們如果依據上邊的小統計而矯正自己：做丈夫的好好地發展他的事業，處處誠懇，而妻子也能减少一些無理的要求，多流露伊的情感，那麼，家庭的生活定將趨於快樂而美滿了。</p>
<h3>兒童挑食心理的檢討</h3>
<p>— 程衆</p>
<p>在一般的家庭中，往往可看到子女吃這樣，不吃那樣的事情發生。</p>
<p>這種揀食的原因不外兩種</p>
<p>就是子女的胃部有病，說得「新」些，就須立刻打針，吃藥地醫治；但這一點，我個人迄今尙未見到一個診治後而不揀食的孩子，不過這也不能不算是原因之一。</p>
<p>就是作者今日要檢討的，即完全由父母「慣使」成功的！先舉個例來說：</p>
<p>舍親有二獨養子，因爲是「獨養子」，所以一切都護他任性。最初，他不肯吃藥芹，說是有藥味，由此他的父母連一藥芹買進門都不准；若在別人一家吃飯而桌上有藥芹，那孩子一尙未說出「討厭」「不吃」的話來，而他的父母就好像說出：「我家××是不吃藥芹的」是無上光榮似的；後來那孩子不斷增加他不吃的菜的數量，猪胃子有氣味不吃，猪腰子有氣味不吃；羊肉亦有氣味亦不吃；……代他統計一下，不下十多種！但他的父母仍然如故，並不想方法使他吃。。——有一部份他根本就沒有吃過。——有一次，他母親無意把猪胃湯給他吃，他仍是很貪婪地吃，並沒有覺到有什麼氣味」；可是等到他母親發覺後而吿訴他之後，他就立刻停止吃下去，還哭了一塲。</p>
<p>由這段事實，我們可以知道兒童揀食，是一種心理作用——其實說得透澈點，就是「慣使」作用，——在作祟，至於原因我想是這樣的：</p>
<p>一個兒童都有他的好勝心，和常常愛撤嬌的心，尤其是父母不加適當管束的孩子，假使有一次，小孩子因爲沒有好菜就以這樣不吃，那樣不吃地要求父母，父母立刻就依照他弄些別的菜給他吃；在父母，當然是爲了愛牠，爲了不願看着自己的子女受餓；可是在孩子方面，就以爲這是種極好的要挾手段；於是一再如此，他當然不願再吃那樣菜了。若再加上父母常當着孩子面前，說那種自以爲光榮，而間接鼓勵他的話，或者幾個不負責的人說是「還小哩的話，這孩子又怎得不使孩子大膽地再來別的嘗試呢？還有一種就是孩子聽別人說這　不好吃，那樣有氣味的話，在孩子根本就不懂什麽，而以爲這種很有趣，亦就跟着學會，久而久之，就成了習慣。</p>
<p>我想上述兩點，大概是最重要的原因吧！其他如環境問題，如第一次給孩子嘗試而生厭惡心等亦是，不過總而言之：多是人爲的，而並非是病」</p>
<p>做父母的請注意這點，並且立刻就改正你子女的環境習慣吧！不過我們不能說慢慢地等孩子大了再糾正，或者是等他自己改正；我們須要一刀兩斷地做，作者並非「唯打駡主義論」者，但亦不是「唯利誘哄騙主義者」的人；因爲吃東西，祇有吃與不吃之分，並沒有吃與不吃各佔百分之幾的理由。我認爲使他們吃的方法，以其他美味合起來給孩子吃，或者事前不吿訴他讓他久而久之忘却了這一點爲較好。一句話說：就是利用心理學上底「轉移律」。</p>
<p>上面不過作者個人一點意見，來貢獻給諸位讀者，——當然並非專爲舍親而發，——更希望大家來討論一下，得一圓滿的解決方法。因爲一個人不吃這樣，不吃那樣地活着，對自己是多麽地不幸，而對別人是多麼地不便，甚而致於厭惡啊！</p>
<h3>我的家搬到鄕下後</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>自戰爭開始，物價上漲以後，我的家庭之累，也一天沉重一天。爲了要求生存，自然要想法子，開源無路，祇有節流。米漲到二十多元一担後，我們節約的第一步，就是把女傭解僱，接着又把房子翻小，取消早餐，改食餅饅一類早點，而最後，就是把家搬到鄉下去。</p>
<p>本來家當然在內地較爲節省，但家搬回了鄕下，我個人還是要租房子，弄伙食，那豈非比住在上海更不經濟，祇有勉强把家寄托在這個繁華都市中。照我的收入，壓根兒不配做上海住民，這問題所以不能解決者，就爲個人的食宿，原是出於無可奈何。</p>
<p>直到前年雙十節，我因爲兼了另一學校的針職，是供給膳宿的，當時看看上海的物價，日漲夜大，便決心把家搬到鄕下去，讓我一個人住在上海。在開支方面，總可减省些了。而那時我的所以要還鄕搬家，除了節省開支以外，更因妻子又要產生孩子了，自從女傭辭退後，所有管家工作，都由伊一人擔任，在大腹使便的當兒，自然不能再工作了。</p>
<p>屈指到現在，是一年半了，一年半的時間，說長不長，說短也不短，但這個一年半中，物價的上漲，竟出人意外。當我搬回去時，米祇六十多元一担，柴一個月祇燒二三元，現在米將近三百元，柴每天要燒一元，其他如日用品之類，更不必說了。當初我估計到每月的開支七十元已足够，但現在非三百元不可，還是每天吃些粥和素菜。</p>
<p>過去幾個學期，敎育界的薪給也未始不加，但所加的總是追不上物價，而今妻子也在敎書，兩個人賺來的錢，維持家用，還時常在寅吃卯糧，妻子每次的來信，總是說米價又漲了，再要漲下去，命怕不能活下去了哪！親友們和我相見，總是說我聰明人，有先見之明，老早把家搬回鄕下，今日可免軋米軋油之苦，但他們又那裏會知道內地的生活程度，比之上海，相差有限，我們也在苦難中度日呢！</p>
<h3>電影明星夫婦因何要離婚</h3>
<p>— 心鵑</p>
<p>好萊塢有的是漂亮的明星，動人的影片，美麗的風光，此外冰是層出不窮的時髦的離婚案件了。最近一年來，新婚的固然不少，如蓓蒂黛維絲與方斯華·露茜鮑兒與台西阿納茨·狄安娜　萍與馮保羅·咸廉霍爾頓與白蘭黛瑪霞兒·裘蒂迦綸與台芙羅斯·康絲登裴納與吉爾勃羅倫等等；喜訊將近的，尙有卡萊葛倫與白蓓蘭許頓·湯尼馬丁與拉娜透納等等；可是鬧離婚也多得不可開交，最近，埃洛爾茀林夫人向法院以「精神虐待」爲理由，要求與其夫離異，埃洛爾茀林夫婦一向是很恩愛的，此次竟至對簿公堂，殊令人不解。</p>
<p>明星們容易離婚，原因厥有數端：一·報紙雜誌和閒人的飛短流長，造謠生事，二·是他的性情，三·是他們的社交生活；以上三端，可以說是構成離婚的主要原因。</p>
<p>在家庭裏，夫婦常因抵觸而發生裂痕，魯易海華和伊黛羅碧諾他們就很注意到這一點，他們彼此知道怎樣去避免對方的惡感。他們有同樣的嗜好，而且彼此都非常坦白誠實，在大家都有戲拍的時候就分屋而居，免得因工作勞苦而發生煩惱。他們處處地方都相敬如賓，竭力忘去自已是個了不起的大明星，所以他們結褵三年，却從未吵嘴，這也許是因爲他們懂得「夫婦之道」的緣故吧！</p>

<h3>一星期家常菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>近來不知是甚麼緣故，猪肉代價之貴，眞的是駭人聽聞，每斤曾到過十元大關，這幾天也須七元半左右，叫人如何敢作食肉之想？想到五年前每元可買三四斤，眞的是黃金時代啊！可是猪肉雖貴，我這菜單中却又少它不來，只得請大家每天買這麽二三元，（一）元是最少之數，再少肉店裏就不肯賣給你，）多加些輔佐品，炒炒肉絲，殺殺饑吧。最時鮮的，要算是菱兒菜炒肉絲，這東西好像是小茭白，外面有殼，每斤約在一元左右，倘若加些竹笋絲在內，那麼買半元的茭兒菜，二元的猪肉，也可以敷衍日夜二餐了。</p>

<h3>「離婚後怎辦？」</h3>
<p>— 何如</p>
<p>—一些小意見</p>
<p>離婚後怎辦？差不多每一個離婚後的女子都這樣想。</p>
<p>祖英女士指出了三條路，但伊根據了一半年來的嘗試」伊看見了每條路上都高掛了「此路不通」的牌子，就失望而且消極了，伊想自殺，三次的自殺。……</p>
<p>這確是應該同情而且幫助的！但我們除了同情以外，還有忿怒！我們看見殺人不見血的禮敎和制度將一個「年紀只有二十四歲」的靑年女子逼到無路可走的地步，以致於三次的自殺，爲祖英女士着想，爲自己未來幸福計，應該報復。這就是說不管「親戚們的含血噴人的話」，不管他們的侮辱和卑視，不管他們的爲了一些些小事「就當作新聞看而一傳十十傳百的義務、宣傳」，一切都當作不聞不問，而照着自己的意思去做自己所認爲可以做的事：自殺只是懦弱的服屈的表示，爲什麼一個年紀很輕的人就屈服在行將崩潰的禮敎之前呢？</p>
<p>謀職業確是不大容易的，「一個髙中尙未畢業的女子」，在此時此地，確是沒有一一個地方容你挿足」的，但這不必灰心也不必怨恨，因爲有還補救的辦法。如果家庭經濟不成問題的話大可以利用空閑的時光，學習一些專門的技術，例如打字，會計，紡織，縫紉，護士，醫藥，無錢電，等等，都可以依照自己的興趣去學，有了技術，職業自然迎刃而解，而且如今正有許多地方熱烈地需要技術人材啊！</p>
<p>「好馬是不是「不吃回頭草」，我們不知道，然而「好女不嫁二夫」這似乎並不是一件天經地義的事：何况時代文明的巨輪，已推到二十世紀的今日，爲什麼還將這些陳腐的觀念放在腦筋裏？誠如祖英女士所說的：「女子的再嫁和男子的續絃有何不同呢？」照原則上講起來這是一些也沒有不同的。但祖英女士竟然遭到「卑視」了；這因爲人們的眼光還停留在舊禮敎的社會的習慣裏。然而時代是前進的，人們的思想行爲也該眼着前進整個的舊制度已經打破，一些閑話和卑視又算得什麼呢？</p>
<p>這是一些小意見，不知祖英女士以爲如何？</p>

At the same time, the Prime Minister's Office, based on the aforementioned decree, has appointed Admiral Darlan as Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Army, and Air Force.</p>
<p>Vichy, 18th (Haitong News Agency) – The new law published in the French government gazette is attracting widespread attention. Article 1 stipulates the establishment of a Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Army, and Air Force. Article 2 stipulates that the Commander-in-Chief is appointed by and responsible to the head of state. Article 3 stipulates that the Commander-in-Chief may attend cabinet meetings when issues discussed concern their duties. Article 4 grants the Commander-in-Chief broad powers to organize, train, and deploy the national armed forces, stipulating that the government shall decide on the supply and equipment of the armed forces after hearing their opinion. All merchant ships, civilian aircraft, and staff of the Navy, Army, and Air Force are under the control of the Commander-in-Chief. The appointment and promotion of generals are also handled by the Commander-in-Chief in accordance with current laws and regulations. The final article of the new law abolishes the Ministry of National Defense.</p>
<p>Vichy, 17th (Havas) – During the transition between the old and new cabinets in France, the atmosphere in Vichy is quite tense, reminiscent of the frequent cabinet reshuffles before the war. Laval, who was summoned to form a cabinet, returned here from Paris yesterday and had a long talk with Marshal Pétain and Cabinet Associate Darlan that evening. While Laval was in contact with several key political figures, the outgoing cabinet held its final meeting. All cabinet members submitted their resignations to Marshal Pétain. In his resignation letter, Darlan stated that he was resigning from all his positions so that the Marshal could take the most appropriate decisions for the welfare of the country, thus opening the way for the formation of a new cabinet. The public originally thought that the list of the new cabinet would be announced soon, but in fact, although politicians and reporters were waiting in the reception rooms of various government offices, the list has been delayed until now. This cabinet reshuffle is very different from the one a few months ago, as the previous one had clues beforehand, while this one came suddenly and was the result of an absolutely secret decision. Although the list of the new cabinet has not been officially announced, speculations are already rife. At this difficult time, the selection of cabinet members by Laval is of course extremely important, and Laval's contacts with various parties will not only determine the new cabinet members, but also determine the policies that France will adopt in international politics in the future. The recall of U.S. Ambassador to France, Admiral Leahy, is also a major development in the situation, which has been confirmed this afternoon. Political figures are not surprised by President Roosevelt's decision, as the anti-French movement promoted by American newspapers recently has long been foreseen. Moreover, under the current circumstances, it is reasonable for President Roosevelt to want to meet with the Ambassador to France in person. However, the responsible authorities here have so far refused to comment on this matter, which shows that the French government does not want to overemphasize this move. In short, the future French foreign policy will only be clear after the new cabinet is formed.</p>
<h3>Laval's Cabinet List Announced Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Vichy, 18th (Havas) – Laval's cabinet list may be announced around 5 p.m. this afternoon.</p>
<p>Vichy, 18th (Haitong News Agency) – Laval did not leave the Sévié villa yesterday afternoon, and studied the list of the new government with Marshal Pétain and his confidants. Political sources with inside information said yesterday that Marshal Pétain did not fully agree with Laval taking the position of head of government, and Laval himself did not intend to take this position. It is expected that the new government list will be published at the same time as Marshal Pétain's declaration, so as to show the world that Laval is fully trusted by Marshal Pétain.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Allied News Agency) – According to a telegram from Vichy, Laval will announce the new cabinet members today or on the 18th, and the policy statement has also been drafted. The statement will focus on domestic issues, especially solving the food problem, encouraging agricultural production, and the problem of French prisoners of war, in view of the extremely delicate French foreign relations. Communications from the British and American sides believe that Laval intends to fundamentally reorganize the military and political departments, and it is rumored that the French government will move back to Paris, leaving only the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Vichy.</p>
<p>Geneva, 17th (Havas) – Regarding the French cabinet reshuffle, political figures here are now waiting for the official French announcement of the new cabinet list, but the press has been impatient and speculated, privately drawing up a "possible" list as follows: Laval will serve as Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Interior, and Propaganda; Mesin will be the Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs; Marion will be the Undersecretary of Propaganda; Hilaire will be the Undersecretary of the Interior; and national police affairs will be handled by Busquet; Minister of Justice Barthelemy will continue to be reappointed; General Dunz and General Brido are the most hopeful for the post of Minister of the Army; General Chenagan will be the Minister of Aviation; Admiral Aufan will be the Minister of the Navy; Minister of Finance Putillier will also continue to be reappointed; Minister of Education will be assumed by Bonar, a member of the Institut de France; Le Roy Ladurie will be the Minister of Food; Tracatel will be the Minister of Labor; Chicely will be the Minister of Transportation; and Bergaff will be the Minister of National Economy; Minister of Colonies Rear Admiral Bellatour will also continue to be reappointed.</p>
<p>Swiss Capital, 18th (Haitong News Agency) – An editorial in the "Basler Zeitung" today stated that the French government reshuffle was decided after careful consideration. Although General Pétain no longer personally presides over cabinet meetings after Laval joined the cabinet, General Pétain's moral character is deeply moving, so his reputation will not be affected in the slightest. Although Darlan has withdrawn from the cabinet, he has been reassigned as Commander-in-Chief of the French Navy, Army, and Air Force, and his position has almost become the dictator of French military affairs. The newspaper believes that Darlan will not use his powers to hand over the French fleet to the Axis powers or organize French auxiliary legions to fight against the Soviet Union. It should be known that Darlan's policy only supports economic cooperation with the Axis powers and opposes military cooperation. As for what Laval will do after taking office, we dare to assert that Laval will work for economic cooperation between Germany and France, prevent Britain from invading France, and thus give Germany a safe guarantee in the rear this summer. Anything more than this is something that Laval would not want to do. It is wrong to compare Laval with Quisling. What Germany will gain after Laval joins the cabinet is realistic hope, that is, to increase the supply of French industries to Germany and to ensure that Germany will not have to worry about the incitement of Teggert elements in the non-occupied areas. The newspaper went on to believe that Laval will be able to use his skillful skills to avoid conflicts with Anglo-Saxon countries.</p>
<p>Vichy, 17th (Havas) – Laval's re-emergence after more than a year of seclusion and his regaining of the prime ministership has attracted worldwide attention. His life experience is described below for the reference of those who care about the French political situation. Pierre Laval, 59, was born in June 1883 in Chateldon village, Pou de Dôme province, Auvergne. His family was poor. He helped his father at home when he was young. When he grew up, he studied at the Saint-Étienne Middle School, and then transferred to the Bayonne Middle School. He then went to Paris to take the French law exam, and was registered in the Paris Bar Association in 1909. He successively served as legal counsel to various trade unions, and repeatedly represented a worker in court. In 1914, he was elected as a member of the Chamber of Deputies in a town near Paris, at the age of 31, and his political career began. In 1927, he was elected as a senator, and in 1935, he was re-elected. This was his parliamentary life. In 1923, he was elected as the mayor of Abbeville, a city near Paris, and has been re-elected until now, and has not been changed. Laval's entry into the cabinet began in 1925. He first served as Minister of Public Works, and successively served as Undersecretary in the Briand cabinet, and Minister of Justice and Minister of Labor in the Tardiou cabinet. In 1931, Laval first served as Prime Minister until February 6, 1934, when he resigned. Later, Doumergue took office as Prime Minister and formed the so-called coordinated and understanding national cabinet, and ordered Laval to successively serve as Minister of Colonies and Minister of Foreign Affairs. Around 1935, France was surrounded by crises, and its foreign relations were extremely tense. For a time, there was a sense of panic. Laval took over the prime ministership again and implemented a resolute policy to seek the restoration of France. Financial security and lower living standards were his main tasks, and he strived to align with the views and interests of the major European countries. The delicate issue of the Saar region referendum was resolved by him in a peaceful atmosphere, and the serious international disputes encountered by France during the Abyssinian War were also safely overcome thanks to Laval. On January 20, 1936, the French Popular Front gained power, and Laval was forced to leave office. At that time, he continued to defend his own views in the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee as a senator. In early September 1939, he took the opportunity of the government's request for a vote of confidence in the parliament to oppose the government's declaration of war. In early 1940, he delivered a speech in the Senate and made a final warning to the government. When the French-German armistice agreement was concluded, Marshal Pétain came to power and stationed in Bordeaux, and appointed Laval as a cabinet associate. In July 1940, he represented the government at the National Assembly convened in Vichy, and enabled the Assembly to decide to grant Marshal Pétain full powers. According to Laval's policy, he aimed to make France and Germany trust each other, so in October 1940, he promoted the historic meeting between Marshal Pétain and German leader Hitler in Montoire. He resigned a few weeks later, but still advocated French-German compromise and European group policies. On August 27 last year, he was stabbed and injured in Versailles and was hospitalized for treatment. Since his recovery, he has become more convinced that his personal views are practical. A few weeks ago, Laval told Marshal Pétain in person what he was worried about. Under these circumstances, Pétain ordered Laval to form a cabinet in order to benefit the country.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Decides to Recall Ambassador to France, and Will Announce U.S. Policy; London Attaches Importance to the French Government Reshuffle</h3>
<p>Washington, 18th (Reuters) – Undersecretary of State Welles declared yesterday that, in view of the impact of Laval's organization of a new government in France, President Roosevelt has decided to recall Ambassador to France, Admiral Leahy, to return home for consultations. Once the titles of Laval's cabinet members are announced, the United States will announce its policy. During Ambassador Leahy's absence, the embassy's Counselor, Throg, will be the Chargé d'affaires. Mrs. Leahy underwent surgery a few days ago. As soon as she recovers, Ambassador Leahy will set off to return home. In addition, the note submitted by France for the United States to establish a consulate in Brazzaville, French Equatorial Africa, has been rejected by the United States.</p>
<p>Washington, 17th (Havas) – A spokesman for the French Embassy in the United States told the press that Ambassador Henri hasn't received government instructions to return home for consultations. After the signing of the French-German armistice agreement in June 1940, U.S. Ambassador to France, Bullitt, was also summoned to return home, while the French ambassador remained in Washington. This fact should be remembered.</p>
<p>Swedish Capital, 18th (Haitong News Agency) – Swedish newspapers received news from London. London newspapers believe that Washington's recall of U.S. Ambassador to Vichy, Leahy, is the first step in the severance of relations between the U.S. and France. If the United States breaks off diplomatic relations with France, it will formally recognize de Gaulle's government. London attaches importance to the French government reshuffle, as evidenced by the fact that British Prime Minister Churchill is about to deliver a broadcast speech.</p>
<h3>Germany's Attitude Towards Vichy Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Haitong News Agency) – The German Foreign Ministry held an information meeting yesterday, proving that Germany's attitude towards the Vichy government remains unchanged. Minister Schmidt discussed the recent events in Vichy, such as the meeting between Laval and General Pétain the day before, the recall of U.S. Ambassador to Vichy, Leahy, and the news released by the government gazette and news agencies, one by one. The fact that German Ambassador to Paris, Abetz, is still in Germany has been confirmed. A reporter raised the possibility that Laval had contacts with the German side when he was in Paris. Schmidt did not comment on the crowd's feelings about this matter, and said that he did not deny it.</p>

As for the progress of the talks, apart from the official guarantee that the talks are "proceeding smoothly," nothing else has been heard.</p>

<h3>Argentina Considers Amending Election Law</h3>
<p>Argentine Capital, 18th (Haitong News Agency) – Argentine Vice President Castillo made a statement to a reporter from "Ahora Weekly," stating that Argentina's sovereignty is not threatened, and Argentina's foreign policy will not be easily shaken. The entire nation supports the current policy. Regarding domestic affairs, Castillo declared that although martial law is currently in effect, the parliament is not restricted. The government is considering amending the election law and reforming the organization of political parties so that honest and capable people have the opportunity to work diligently for national affairs. The government will do its best to provide ships to develop export trade, and the development of industry will also be assisted. Private capital will also be mobilized. The expansion of the arms industry and the exploitation of coal and iron are very important. Although there are many difficulties, there is no way to solve them.</p>
<h3>Strength of the French Fleet</h3>
<p>London, 18th (Reuters) – After the changes in the French political situation, the country's navy has become a topic of public discussion. According to the Reuters naval reporter, the fleet commanded by the country's Navy Commander-in-Chief Darlan is as follows: The Toulon port in the country is stationed with the battleships Strasbourg (26,500 tons) and Provence. The new-style battleship Dunkerque (26,500 tons) is under repair in the dock in the port. In addition, there is also an aircraft carrier, Teste (10,000 tons), four 8-inch gun cruisers, three 6-inch gun cruisers, nineteen large destroyers, and fifteen submarines. The Casablanca port in North Africa is stationed with the battleship Jean Bart (35,000 tons), but the turret has been destroyed. In addition, there is a 6-inch gun cruiser. The Dakar port in West Africa is stationed with the battleship Richelieu (35,000 tons), which is also under repair. In addition, there are three 6-inch cruisers. The Martinique Island in America is stationed with the aircraft carrier Béarn (22,146 tons) and two 6-inch gun cruisers. It is certain that destroyers and submarines must also be stationed in the above places. The island of Malta in the Mediterranean has been bombed more than 1,000 times since the British and Germans declared war. This number is astounding. However, Malta is still Malta. According to Berlin Radio, "Although Malta has been fiercely attacked by the Axis forces, the British army can still resist for a long time. The main reason is that the island's coastal artillery is protected by rocks, which makes it easy to defend. At the same time, Malta has no rear road to attack. The Axis forces can only attack directly from the sea or the air. For this reason, the Battle of Malta cannot be compared with the rapid conquest of Hong Kong and Singapore." It can be seen that the reason why Malta can be defended for a long time. The two pictures on the left are photos of the port of Malta.</p>

<h3>Thailand Prepares to Move Capital</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 18th (Haitong News Agency) – The Thai government is now preparing to move its capital from Bangkok to another location.

It is generally known that the government has been planning this for many years. It is expected that the new site will be either Lopburi, 120 kilometers north of Bangkok, or Ayutthaya (the old capital of Thailand from 1350 to 1767), 60 kilometers north of Bangkok. If this plan is decided upon, it will still take several years to realize, as it will require the construction of official residences and other facilities.</p>

In short, his mission is similar to that of his predecessor, General Wavell. As for whether New Zealand is within MacArthur's command, I am still unable to say for sure at this time. Furthermore, the air defense of the US mainland needs to be strengthened urgently. We must obtain security for our cities and factories so that our war efforts are not interrupted for a moment.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 18th (Haitong News Agency) – According to Swedish newspapers, the news that Cripps will succeed Linlithgow as Governor-General of India has caused excitement in London. Cripps' delay in Cairo shows that this news has considerable certainty, but it is not yet certain whether Cripps will accept this position. According to sources close to Cripps, Cripps is unwilling to prolong his time away from Britain, but political circles in London believe that Cripps is the only person familiar with Indian affairs and has close relations with Indian leaders, and is sufficient to organize India's defense in the current environment. Recent news from Cairo says that Cripps' talks with Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas were extremely important.

<h3>Fierce Fighting on Two Fronts in the East, Situation About to Change</h3>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Haitong News Agency) – This afternoon's German military report stated that the Soviet troops attacking in various parts of Eastern Europe were all repelled. German fighter groups sank an enemy merchant ship (7,000 tons) in the Black Sea. Our army won victories in the central and northern routes, regardless of the difficulty of the terrain. Our aircraft fiercely bombed enemy forces and tank concentration areas, as well as Soviet rear transportation. The enemy forces annihilated in the previous day's battle report.</p>
<p>Moscow, 18th (Reuters) – The Soviet noon communiqué stated, "There were no major changes on the front line last night." A supplementary communiqué stated, "On the central front, Soviet troops broke through the German army's resistance and occupied several strong points." According to Soviet news agencies, Soviet troops in a sector of the Finnish front have broken through the Finnish lines and advanced several miles.</p>
<p>Moscow, 18th (News Agency) – Soviet communiqué states that Soviet forces launched offensives on several lines on the 17th, improving their positions.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 17th (Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>The spring offensive is about to begin, and it is expected that the situation on the Eastern Front will change completely. Military figures here have explained the positions currently held by the German and Soviet armies. It is said that because neither the Finnish nor the Soviet sides have released any news about the Finnish border, it is difficult to determine how the positions of the two sides are divided. In the Leningrad area, it can be determined that the city has long been surrounded by the German army. The two sides are fighting fiercely in front of the town of Ivanovskoye, fifteen miles southeast of the city. It is found that Ivanovskoye is an outpost of the Red Army in that theater. Further southeast is the town of Chassapovo. Also, the important town of Lyuban, a major town along the Moscow-Leningrad railway line, located sixty miles southeast of Leningrad, is also a key point that the German and Soviet armies must contend for. The Red Army has lost and regained it many times. It seems that it has now fallen into German hands again. Another railway center, Chudovo, although it has also been occupied by the German army, is surrounded by the Red Army. As for the two towns of Spas-Polist and Podberezye near the city, they have been recovered by the Red Army. The Red Army took advantage of the victory to advance and cut off the railway line from Novgorod to Leningrad. This front line, starting from the city of Novgorod, runs along Lake Ilmen, south to the city of Shimsk (thirty miles northwest of Staraya Russa). The fighting in the area is very chaotic. According to the Soviet side, the German Sixteenth Army has been isolated, but the German side flatly denies it. Traveling south from this line to the town of Beloye on the Leningrad-Vitebsk railway, and then turning southeast, is the Lovat River. It is even more difficult to accurately describe the positions of the two sides below the current situation. However, after this front line passes twelve miles east of Luki, it runs in a straight line south to the upper reaches of the Lovat River, to the border of Belarus. The front line runs along the Disna River to the city of Velizh (sixty miles northeast of the city of Vitebsk). Recently, tank formations from both sides fought fiercely in the area. In terms of the central front, from north to south, to the city of Demidov (fifty miles northwest of Smolensk), the city of Dukhovshchina is in German hands, but the Red Army continues to resist in the small towns near the city. The front line moves further south, passing through the cities of Yartsevo and Krasnaya (ten miles north of Vyazma). The German army holds Vyazma firmly and has not been surrounded by the Red Army. However, the railway from Yartsevo to Vyazma and Krasnaya is controlled by the Red Army. As for the railway from Vyazma to Smolensk, although it is completely under the control of the German army, it has been reached by the Red Army's artillery fire. From north to south, to Dorogobuzh and Elnino, east of Bryansk, it is connected to the Orel railway line to the city of Khotynets. The situation of the fighting near Orel is unclear. Further south to the Kursk railway, it runs parallel to the Kursk-Kharkov railway to the city of Chervonodvarichne (twenty-five miles northwest of Kharkov). From there, east to the city of Losovaya (forty miles southeast of Kharkov), it reaches the end of the Soviet positions. On the southern route, the positions of the two sides are even more difficult to distinguish. Generally, they run westward, passing through the two cities of Barvenkovo and Slavyansk, and then along the railway straight to the city of Taganrog. The important stronghold of Stalino has fallen into the hands of the German army.</p>
<p>Special Issue on the Indian Question</p>
<h3>Retracing the Three Exchanges (Part 2) – The Mughal Empire</h3>
<p>From the eighth century onwards, Islam gradually spread to India. At the end of the tenth century, the Turks established the Ghaznavid Dynasty in eastern Persia. In the first thirty years of the eleventh century, they repeatedly invaded India. Their power reached the Ganges River basin. Soon, the related Ghurid Dynasty rose and penetrated deeper into the Indian interior, sweeping away the forces of the Rajput principalities that were fighting each other. As a result, Islam became even more deeply rooted. These two hundred years were the so-called Islamic dynasty in Indian history. Later, the Ghurid general Qutb-ud-din declared himself independent in Delhi and established the Slave Dynasty. According to legend, in the early thirteenth century, when Genghis Khan went west to conquer Khwarazm, he intended to invade India, but because he encountered a monster called "Jiaoduan" at the Iron Gate, and Yelü Chucai took the opportunity to advise him, he stopped the army from invading India. At that time, it happened to be the dark age of the Slave Dynasty. The arrival of foreign insults might not have promoted the progress and unification of India. The Mongols, who were good at fighting, might not have been able to succeed in tropical India. From this point of view, Genghis Khan's decision to stop advancing may have been India's misfortune.</p>
<p>In the mid-fourteenth century, the Mongolian prodigy Timur rose in Central Asia. He was actually a Turk who claimed to be a descendant of Genghis Khan. After conquering the entire territory of Central Asia, he took advantage of the fact that the king of India forced his subjects to convert to Islam, causing great chaos throughout the country. He crossed the Indus River from the Indian border in 1398, carrying out large-scale massacres. He defeated the Indian king Mahmud III at Panipat, captured Delhi, and advanced to the west bank of the Ganges River. Because of events in Asia Minor, he stopped the army from invading India, and India expressed its obedience to Timur's rule. However, Timur's empire disintegrated faster than Genghis Khan's empire, and was destroyed by the Uzbeks (now one of the Soviet Union's republics) in just a century. One of his great-great-grandsons, Zahir-ed-Din, nicknamed Baber (meaning "tiger"), wandered aimlessly after the country was destroyed, but he was determined to cultivate strength in order to restore the country. After he fought unsuccessfully against the Uzbeks, he focused on managing India. In 1526, Babur conquered northern India, established his capital in Delhi, and founded the Mughal Empire. It is said that he was a person of both literary and military talent. His autobiography written in Turkish is still the most valuable historical material recording the events from the Timurid Empire to the Mughal Empire. Babur was succeeded by Akbar, who was good at eliminating the conflicts between the Islamic kingdoms and the Hindu states, and organized them into a great empire. As a result, India once again prospered. From Akbar onwards, the integrity of the empire could still be barely maintained for two centuries. In the early eighteenth century, after the death of the famous King Aurangzeb, powerful ministers and vassal kings seized power, gradually becoming a major problem. When Britain and France began to compete for Indian colonies, the Mughal king still reigned in Delhi, but he could no longer issue orders outside the capital, and could only sit and watch the arrival of the doom of destruction.</p>
<p>In summary, it can be seen that India's fatal wound lies in the division of internal political power and the differences in sects. This has been the case since ancient times. Therefore, even with great achievements in culture and religion, it ultimately cannot compensate for danger and destruction. Recently, when India's fate was hanging by a thread, its internal divisions had not yet been declared extinguished. This is not just India's own misfortune.</p>
<h3>Malakand Pass</h3>
<p>When Alexander invaded India in 326 BC, he passed through the Malakand Pass. The Buddhist monument there still stands today. It is located close to the Hindu Kush, which is the border between the Soviet Union and India.</p>

<h3>The Oriental Nation of Female Rights: Sketches of Burmese Women (Continued)</h3>
<p>Some carry baskets of goods on their heads to sell; even in the marketplace, they are busy with buying and selling, and looking out in the fields, they are also the ones cultivating. Burmese men, after plowing the fields, hardly care about anything else, such as transplanting rice seedlings! Harvesting! Threshing!... There is no responsibility that isn't placed on the shoulders of women. Therefore, the majority of Burma's agricultural produce can be said to be the result of women's blood and sweat! Their family handicrafts vary from place to place, for example, umbrellas from Bassein, lacquerware from Pagan, silk shawls from Mandalay, etc., are all their achievements.</p>
<p>Silk weaving can be considered the most important family handicraft in all of Burma, and can also be considered completely feminized, because it is young girls and married women who do the weaving; and the world-famous Burmese cheroots are entirely hand-rolled by women, from the planting of the tobacco to the rolling, cutting, and packaging, almost every step of the work has not been touched by men.</p>
<p>Fearless in Wrestling, Fighting, and Facing Danger</p>
<p>In short, no matter what kind of handicraft it is, women have become necessary workers; in all areas of economic activity, even if they don't surpass men, they are no less than men. They can wrestle and fight like men, they can defend themselves, and they can be fearless in the face of danger.</p>
<p>The inner world of Burmese women is pure and flawless, filled with qualities such as gentleness, harmony, joy, liveliness, and passion. They are willing to work hard at any labor. But they never give up the opportunity to enjoy themselves in a timely manner, such as watching plays, celebrating Buddhist festivals, playing music, and dancing, especially dancing and music are essential elements for nurturing their emotions; they love watching plays even more than men, in small opera troupes, the clown's every word and action, crude and vulgar, when they hear the subtle parts, they can laugh wildly like men; Burmese women are generally good at singing and dancing, but not proficient in music, painting, and other arithmetic, this is probably due to time and habits! Burmese women, because they are economically independent, are extremely open and free in their social interactions.</p>
<p>Extremely Active in Social Aspects</p>
<p>When they go out, they never ride animals, and they rarely use two-wheeled handcarts for transportation. They are unwilling to wear strange clothes, nor do they want to show off their beauty. Usually, their head, hands, and toes are exposed outside their clothes. When they go out, they don't learn from the Persians to cover their lovely faces with veils, or imitate Muslims to hide their beautiful silk clothes with coats. In private social interactions, they are extremely active members, because they are amiable and kind, and good at treating people and dealing with things. Even if a stranger mistakenly enters the house and takes a seat, they will be treated hospitably. If someone making a deal visits, they will first be treated hospitably before discussing business. Even debt collectors will not be treated differently.</p>
<p>Their philosophy of life is that living now should be entirely for the sake of happiness in the next life; the present is not important, the next life is the final destination, but current efforts can also help future enjoyment, so they do not pay much attention to group social activities, but are as enthusiastic about individual careers as European and American women are about churches.</p>
<p>Piously Believing in the Old Religion</p>
<p>If Burmese women do not believe in religion; and piously accept the extremely divine admonitions, they are empty to the point of having nothing. Their customs and habits only arise from religion; their lives are dominated by religion; their character is influenced by religion, so religion is the source of all their etiquette, thoughts, aspirations, and actions.</p>
<p>Although Burma has been under British rule, the intrusion of Western powers has still not broken through the concepts of the old social system of Burmese women, or overthrown their inherent faith. They do not dare to take the risk of accepting the baptism of new ideas, because they are afraid of suffering after death! "Not believing in religion is not human" is a common saying used by Burmese men and women to persuade their children.</p>
<p>Holding Ear-Piercing Ceremonies in a Grand Manner</p>
<p>The first major ceremony in a girl's life is ear-piercing, called "D Dun Mingala" (Na Swin Mingala). Piercing the ears marks the beginning of her new era. From then on, every man she sees is a potential lover. When she goes out, she must have her mother, aunt, or married sister as a guardian, and she must dress up every time she goes out.</p>
<p>As the auspicious day approaches, the daughter's heart is filled with both joy and fear. She fears the pain of ear-piercing, and rejoices that she will soon be free. Parents also believe that this is a day as glorious and joyful as when a son becomes a monk, so wealthy people hold banquets, perform plays, and play music, hinting that their daughter is of age, as if to attract people's attention. Wealthy families hire ear piercers to use gold needles (with diamonds at the tip) to pierce the earholes in a grand ceremony, while poor families must use silver needles at the very least. After this, they work to enlarge the earholes, in order to wear diamonds and insert fresh flowers.</p>
<p>The Process of Love is Unique and Interesting</p>
<p>Her love process, if studied seriously, is quite interesting. In rural customs, girls who have had their ears pierced begin to dress up, and soon go to do business. Needless to say, the greatest purpose of that business is to choose a husband. In addition, the well where water is drawn is also a gathering place for young people.</p>
<p>Burmese customs require men to propose to the girl they admire once. When proposing, it is not necessary to be under flowers and moon or on a festive occasion, the general rule is to do it at night, rarely during the day. Therefore, there is a sentence in Burmese (Loo HleJhee AEhain) which means "when proposing", used in everyday conversation, it represents nine o'clock in the evening. "In the morning, women's temperament is easy to anger, and conflicts are easy to try during the day, only at night is the time when women are most lovely and gentle." This is a common experience in Burma.</p>
<h3>British and American Nationals in South China to Arrive in Shanghai in Two Days for Evacuation; British and American Nationals in North China Already Arrived in Shanghai from Yantai</h3>

<h3>Construction of Flood-Proof Slopes on Low-Lying Roads; Dredging of Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>According to a public notice issued by the Public Works Department, the Department is currently continuing with flood control projects in this city. Flooding in this city occurs every year in the coming months. To prepare for a rainy day, the Department has already started constructing flood-proof slopes on various low-lying roads, and the work is said to be progressing very smoothly. Flood-proof slopes on Route Dufong, Route Edan, Route Brenan, and other locations in the Western District have already been completed one after another. The sidewalks in low-lying areas have been greatly raised, and a large amount of garbage and sludge has been used to pave macadam roads. Thousands of square feet of macadam roads without water accumulation have already been paved. The sidewalk on Route Brenan east of Jessfield Park has also been excavated in preparation for building another flood-proof slope. In addition, in order to prevent flooding in the Central and Northern Districts, check valves to prevent river water from flowing back are being installed at the outlets of the major drains on the north bank of Suzhou Creek, and the installation of such check valves has also begun on the west bank of Hongkou Creek. As for the dredging work on Suzhou Creek, it is currently underway in front of the Macgregor Road garbage wharf, and the total amount of silt that has been excavated is approximately 27,500 cubic feet.</p>
<h3>Bombing Case at the Approach to the New Zhapu Bridge; Cracked on the Spot</h3>
<p>(Dispatch from the Allied News Agency in this City) Since the beginning of March, the authorities in this city have been conducting security drills and organizing self-defense groups to patrol and stand guard, in order to prevent crime. Since the implementation, the results have been remarkable, and all terrorist incidents have decreased significantly. For example, in the attempted terrorist case that occurred in the Public Concession on the night of the 14th of this month, the perpetrator was arrested on the spot with the cooperation of nearby residents and the self-defense group. This is the effect of organizing the self-defense group. The authorities have awarded certificates and bonuses to those who bravely arrested the thugs in order to encourage them. On the afternoon of the 14th, at approximately 8:15 p.m., at the army sentry post at the approach to the New Zhapu Bridge in the Public Concession, a thug suddenly threw a paper package at the post and then turned around and tried to escape. At that time, a woman named Yu Mei, who lived nearby, witnessed this situation and shouted loudly, calling her husband, Yu Mubing (47 years old), to join nearby residents and report to the self-defense group and the police, who followed the thug and chased him urgently. After a few steps, they arrested the thug. They immediately opened the paper package and inspected it, and found that it contained a four-pound time bomb, which fortunately did not explode. After a detailed investigation, the perpetrator was named Wang Asheng, 34 years old, and lived at No. 14, Lane 1, Meifang Lane, Route Robison. The next day, more than ten of his accomplices were completely rounded up in one fell swoop. The cracking of the case was unprecedented. The Japanese Kempeitai and the Municipal Council specially awarded certificates and bonuses to Yu Mubing, You Zhengsen (member of the self-defense group), Song Shengcai (member of the self-defense group), Li Xiangzi (member of the self-defense group), Sun Cheng (police officer), and Zhang Zhengzhen (police officer), six local people who assisted in the arrest of the thug, in order to encourage them. After the case was cracked, the authorities expressed deep appreciation for the cooperation of the residents, and hoped that they would continue to cooperate more actively in the future.</p>
<h3>Too Many People Buying Rice; Extended Hours</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council Rice and Grain Office has designated Taikoo, Roosevelt, Zhejiang Xingye, China Maotai and other godowns for rice shops to pick up foreign rice. Because China and Maotai godowns only had the remaining balance from the previous pick-up, the quantity transported by Taikoo, Roosevelt, and Zhejiang Xingye was greater, and the rice shops picked them up yesterday separately, which is expected to be completed tomorrow. Yesterday, the hours for rice shops to sell foreign rice were still extended from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. The crowds of purchasers were extremely crowded, and in the afternoon, there were still long lines in front of the rice shops. Some rice shops did not finish selling by 6:00 p.m., so they unexpectedly extended their business hours. The phenomenon of selling out is gradually becoming universal. Those who have numbered tickets can generally buy foreign rice.</p>
<h3>Two Terror Drills in the Public Concession Yesterday</h3>
<p>At approximately 1:00 p.m. yesterday, the Public Concession Police Department conducted a terror incident drill on Park Road and Edinburgh Road, and temporarily sealed off the area. It was reopened after the drill was completed. Then, at approximately 2:00 p.m., the Police Department held a terror drill in the area of Yuqiaqing Road and Race Course Road, which lasted a full half hour. During the drill, important intersections such as the intersection of Yuqiaqing Road and Avenue Edward VII were sealed off.</p>
<h3>Exanthematous Typhus; Severity Increasing</h3>
<p>According to the French Municipal Council Health Department's March report released yesterday morning, the spread of exanthematous typhus in this city is quite noteworthy. The number of Chinese patients has tripled compared to before, and the number of Western patients has almost doubled. Moreover, the severity of exanthematous typhus has also increased. Among the patients, the mortality rate is 17.4% for foreigners and 22.6% for Chinese. At the same time, the spread of typhoid fever, according to reports from doctors, is also quite rampant among Chinese. The simultaneous spread of both exanthematous typhus and typhoid fever is noteworthy. The number of relapsing fever patients also increased last month, and cases of scarlet fever, diphtheria, and meningitis have been discovered. The number of meningitis patients is slightly higher than before. Vaccination with cowpox continued last month, and at the end of last month, an epidemic prevention campaign was launched. A total of 40,578 people were vaccinated with cowpox, and a total of 34,883 people were vaccinated with epidemic prevention vaccines.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Ships Resume Passenger Service</h3>
<p>Although ships between Shanghai and Ningbo have been sailing recently, they are equivalent to being suspended in intangible form because they do not carry passengers. On the 14th of this month, the Public Concession Municipal Council Information Office announced that the half-price preferential treatment method for returning home set by the bureau will be terminated on May 1. A portion of Ningbo residents residing in this city, because they have no need to reside here, and who followed the authorities' advice to return to their hometown, feel very inconvenient because there are no direct ships. In order to facilitate this batch of people returning to Ningbo, the authorities specially found a way to resume passenger service on the ships. The schedules of the recent ships are as follows: Changshan sailed to Ningbo at 3:00 p.m. yesterday from the Taikoo Wharf, Haitong on the 18th, Hualin on the 19th, and Huawan is temporarily suspended, and the suspended Wanjilun will fill the gap, and the sailing date is set for the 20th.</p>
<h3>Infants' and Young Children's Education Institute; Reception for Fundraising Committee Members</h3>
<p>Reception for Fundraising Committee Members The Shanghai Infants' and Young Children's Education Institute was originally reorganized from the Gonghua Orphanage. It has been in operation for almost two years, and has accommodated 250 orphans, which is quite a large scale. Recently, due to rising prices and depleted funds, most of the children accommodated in the institute are orphans who were victims of the war, and they cannot be dismissed, so a fundraising campaign was held yesterday, and the fundraising committee members were specially invited to the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA, with more than 100 people attending, including Wen Lanting, Chen Xuanhan, Xu Zhichao, Zhang Chunyan, Jin Dingxun, Yao Junzhi, and Ding Fubao. First, Chen Xuanhan gave a speech, and then Zhu Lianxiang and Zhang Jusheng, the executive directors of the institute, reported on the recent situation of the institute. Wen Lanting, Ding Fubao, Jin Dingxun and other gentlemen gave speeches one after another, all believing that children are the future masters of society, and helping the charitable cause of child care is the most meaningful thing, and encouraging everyone to work together, they will definitely break through the fundraising target. The event ended at 8:30 p.m. The institute is located at No. 9, Zhengxiu Lane, Lane 210, Kaifeng Road (telephone number 43276). The fundraising period is set for one month, and all enthusiastic people from all walks of life are sincerely welcome to visit the institute.</p>
<p>Fuyou Receives More Than 50,000 Yuan in Donations</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Fuyou Institute began raising funds for the education and upbringing of orphans on the 15th of last month, donations from all walks of life have been quite enthusiastic. As of the 17th, a total of more than 50,000 yuan in donations had been received. However, this is only half of the predetermined target. It is reported that the number of orphans in the institute is increasing day by day, and prices are soaring, making it very difficult to maintain. Therefore, fundraising continues, and it is hoped that philanthropists from all walks of life will uphold the spirit of child care and generously donate to help complete the target as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Women's Christian Association Affiliated; Supply Cooperative Opens</h3>
<p>The Women's Christian Association, in view of the difficulty in purchasing daily necessities, has specially established a supply cooperative, the purpose of which is to sell household daily necessities such as towels, socks, toothbrushes, etc., to sell old items consigned by the members, and to make clothes and knit wool sweaters on behalf of others, at low prices. The regulations are available upon request. Business hours are from 1:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. The addresses are at No. 43, Lane 43, Wuding Road, and No. 638, Weihaiwei Road. It is reported that it is scheduled to open at 1:00 p.m. on the 20th of this month, and there will definitely be a lively scene at that time.</p>
<h3>Chinese Hospital Epidemic Prevention Campaign</h3>
<p>The Chinese Hospital was founded by Yuan Lüdeng, Wen Lanting, Guan Jiongzhi, Zhou Bangjun, Xie Baosheng, Xu Qianlin and others, and has been in existence for more than ten years. Recently, in view of the fact that the weather in this city is not good and epidemics are rampant, it has jointly launched a summer epidemic prevention campaign with Yamamoto Hospital, Pingmin Hospital, Yamamoto Chuandai Zhifo, Yang Chuanbing, Feng Zhiyin, Huang Yülun, Wang Boyuan and other doctors, and will provide free vaccinations or free consultations from today, in order to prevent problems before they occur and protect health.</p>
<h3>Using False Names to Study and Rashly Discussing Love; Resolution to Punish Severely; Using a Steel Pen Nib as a Weapon to Stab a Love Rival; It Is Not Enough to Administer Strict Punishment to Correct the Academic Atmosphere</h3>
<p>Wang Ziqi, a Suzhou woman residing at No. 333, Tongfu Road, is 19 years old and was studying at Guanghua Middle School. At that time, there was a male student named Zhou Zhaoling in the school who, because of their classmate relationship, saw each other every day, and actually planted seeds of love in each other's hearts, not seeking the length of their studies, but studying love knowledge. Later, Wang was expelled from Guanghua for</p>
<p>Violating School Rules</p>
<p>And Zhou also became estranged from Wang. Xia Lian (17 years old, from Anhui), a female student at Zhendan Middle School, whose cousin was also a student at Guanghua Middle School, and was a classmate of both Zhou and Wang, so Zhou often went to Xia's place to visit Xia's cousin. This aroused Wang's suspicion, thinking that Zhou's break with her must be because he had moved his love to Xia. She couldn't help but feel angry and resentful. At approximately 8:00 p.m. on the 1st of this month, she went to Xia's home at No. 5, Lane 208, Jiaozhou Road, and negotiated with Xia. Because Xia was not at home, she retreated and waited at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Jiaozhou Road. Soon, Xia arrived, and Wang immediately stepped forward and asked Xia to go with her to find Zhou. But Xia refused, saying that she was not familiar with Zhou Zhaoling, so how could she know his address? Unexpectedly, Wang suddenly</p>
<p>Used a Steel Pen Nib</p>
<p>To stab Xia's face twice, causing injuries to her face and temples. After reporting to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, the Chinese detective Yang Fusheng investigated. Wang also directly admitted that she had stabbed Xia with a steel pen nib. She was sued. After investigation, it was found that young men and women today do not think about delving deeper into their studies, but only know how to use the excuse of studying to make friends, talk about love, watch movies, and play in dance halls. If they are not severely punished for such absurd behavior,</p>
<p>It is not enough to correct the academic atmosphere and set the tone. Wang was sentenced to three months' imprisonment. Considering that it was her first offense, she was allowed to reform herself. If she converted the sentence to a fine, it could be calculated at two yuan per day. If there are similar incidents in the future, severe penalties will be imposed.</p>

<h3>Salvation Army Food Distribution; Continuing on Macau Road</h3>
<p>The Salvation Army, which had set up three food distribution points in the Public Concession last winter, namely on Xiamen Road, Maohai Road, and Macau Road, has stopped distributing food at the Xiamen Road and Maohai Road food distribution points by the end of this March. However, the food distribution point on Macau Road is still continuing to distribute food, with approximately 800 people going there to receive food every day. The place also provides relief to those who are forced to sleep on the streets. Every night, Salvation Army workers patrol the streets and distribute food coupons to beggars and refugees on the streets. They can use these coupons to receive food at the food distribution point on Macau Road. According to Colonel Walker, the leader of the Salvation Army in this city, the price of staple foods is expensive this year, so rice is no longer distributed. What is currently distributed is cracked wheat, beans, or sweet potatoes, etc. This kind of food is very nutritious, enough to sustain life, and does not cause beriberi or stomach problems, so it is better than eating pure white rice. Although the cold winter has passed, there are still some beggars who have difficulty making a living, so the food distribution point on Macau Road has decided to continue distributing food to help these people.</p>
<h3>Chinese Relief Association; Holds Small Loan Program</h3>

Applicants should first send a written application to the association at No. 656, Hamilton Building, Jiangxi Road.</p>
<h3>Italian Warship Cook Accused of Fraud</h3>
<p>A Chinese man named Wang Genwei (transliteration) has been serving as a cook on the Italian warship Libento in this city. Because he wanted to defraud 1,700 yuan in cash, he was accused by the captain of the warship, Goffotto. The defendant was hired on the ship last year when the ship was stationed in Tianjin. On the 24th of last month, the ship's purser gave him 1,700 yuan in cash and asked him to buy several kinds of food. However, by the end of last month, the defendant had delayed handing over the food. Goffotto suspected that something was wrong and reported it to the police station. The police officers immediately went to No. 108, Jiaozhou Road, and arrested the defendant. The case was tried the day before yesterday. The defendant did not deny it, but because the plaintiff did not arrive, the trial was postponed to the 24th.</p>

<h3>Regarding the Sale of Canned Food, an Elder Brother Accuses His Younger Brother of Theft</h3>
<p>Wei Chi Baoqing, the owner of the Guandongheng Canned Food Company on Yunnan Road and Hankou Road, previously filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the French Police Department, accusing his younger brother, Wei Chi Zhaojia, the manager of Guanshuhang, of stealing 250 boxes of canned food from the warehouse and selling them for his own use. He requested an investigation. This case was heard again yesterday. According to the plaintiff, the stolen goods were worth over 60,000 yuan, but the defendant only sold them for 35,000 yuan. He requested that the law be enforced. The defendant stated that he was the manager of the company and had the right to sell the goods. The reason for the sale was that his elder brother had been kidnapped the previous year and rescued through various efforts, which cost 40,000 to 50,000 yuan in ransom, causing the company to suffer from a shortage of funds. Therefore, he obtained his elder brother's consent to sell the goods, and the proceeds were handed over to his elder brother. The defendant claimed that he was appointed as manager according to his late father's will. His elder brother was addicted to opium, consuming 200 to 300 yuan worth per day. During their father's lifetime, he had been confined due to his gambling and opium use. He claimed that he was being falsely accused and requested an investigation. The plaintiff further stated that after his younger brother stole and sold the goods, he kept all the proceeds for himself and did not hand them over. It was only when the police sent detectives to his home that they found 16,000 yuan in stolen money. The police, having received a formal receipt and invoice for the purchase of the goods, did not prosecute Kaiyuan Company and only requested the return of the stolen goods. The court ordered a postponement for further hearing, and the defendant was released on his original bail.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Guandongheng Food Store at 123 Yunnan Road is owned by Wei Chi Baoqing from Nanjing. A warehouse was established at 134, 134 Shengmuyuan Road. On March 19th of this year, Wei Chi discovered that the iron lock on the warehouse door had been sawed off and 350 boxes of goods, worth tens of thousands of yuan, had been stolen. He reported this to the French police, who discovered that the culprit was his younger brother, Wei Chi Zhaobao (24 years old). He was arrested and investigated according to the law. It is now learned that during the police investigation, it was also discovered that the defendant had sold the stolen goods to Xiaohecheng Confectionery on Baliaoqiao Street for over 35,000 yuan, which had then been resold to Jin Dingrong, the owner of Kaiyuan Confectionery at No. 1 Yuqingfang, Laoshenfu Road. The police went to arrest the owner of Xiaohecheng, but he had fled upon hearing the news. The shop was sealed off. At the same time, Jin Dingrong also evaded arrest. Jin's wife, Zhang, was summoned and, together with the defendant, was escorted to court yesterday for trial and punishment.</p>

<h3>The Mastermind Behind the Assassination of Xu Xiaokang, Zhou Axiang, Dies of Illness</h3>
<p>On December 28th of last year at 8:20 PM, at the intersection of Rue Henri and Route Tenant de la Tour in the French Concession, a pedestrian was shot and killed. After investigation, the victim was identified as Xu Xiaokang, a 22-year-old native of Pudong, residing at No. 41 Jin Yuli, Rue Pissot. The perpetrator, Zhou Axiang (22 years old), was apprehended on the spot by a police officer. He was taken to the police station for interrogation. However, due to the suspect's illness, he was transferred to the Guangci Hospital Prison Ward. It is now reported that the suspect's condition worsened, and despite medical treatment, he died in custody yesterday morning around 8:00 AM. The police sent the body to the morgue for examination.</p>
<h3>Sunny Weather</h3>
<p>For the past few days, it has been constantly raining, and the spring chill makes one recall the delightful and precious bright spring days of last week. For those living in Shanghai, going to the countryside to enjoy spring is a very troublesome matter. The most convenient places to go, of course, are the parks. Zhaofeng Garden in the Western District, the Bund Park in the Central District, and Gujiazhai Garden in the French Concession are all gathering places for ladies enjoying the spring. On sunny days, going for a stroll in the garden with two or three companions, appreciating the birdsong and fragrant flowers, is truly a delightful experience!

<h3>Taking Medicine as a Meal</h3>
<p>This newspaper previously had an article "Changing Professions," which really hit the mark. But from my point of view, not only are professions changing this year, but people's physical constitutions are also changing! Otherwise, why would people take medicine as a meal! Usually, wealthy people eat tonic medicines and get booster shots because they can't eat their meals, but now, as long as gentlemen, young masters, ladies, and young ladies have a few banknotes in their pockets, they desperately buy and hoard medicine. People say that hoarding medicine is for making money, not for eating as a meal, right? But that is not the case. On the surface, hoarding medicine is indeed for making money, but in reality, it is taking medicine as a meal. Because the mentality of those hoarding medicine is like this: "It doesn't matter how expensive rice gets, four hundred yuan a picul, six hundred yuan a picul, or even a thousand yuan a picul. I don't care, because the medicine I hoard can keep pace with the rising price of rice!" Isn't that literally saying that they are taking medicine as a meal?</p>
<p>The trend of taking medicine as a meal is entirely due to the drug dealers, whose capital of ten or twenty thousand yuan turns into hundreds of thousands. How can this not make people envious? Therefore, the trend of hoarding medicine has become widespread. The drug dealers initially made a fortune inexplicably. Because after the outbreak of the Pacific War, fewer ships came to Shanghai, and the balance between supply and demand was disrupted, these merchants had a golden dream while sleeping in their beds. When they woke up the next morning, the price of medicine had risen, and they suddenly had a huge pile of banknotes! Their mouths have been open ever since. Because of the control of medicine and the difficulty of transportation, the drug merchants tried to transport medicine to the interior, and they made a lot of money again, which led ordinary merchants to also do medicine business, and they also made money. Then it spread to gentlemen, ladies, young masters, and young mistresses who all started doing medicine business. People in Shanghai are like a swarm, if you do this, I will do this too. Hoarding medicine is also like a swarm. There is no reasoning. As long as the medicine hoarded by the hoarder does not exceed twenty kinds, it can be known that it is completely foolish, far inferior to the hoarding methods of the Jews! However, the shop assistants in some pharmacies desperately want to learn from the Jews, stubbornly raising the prices of medicines, thereby encroaching on the banknotes in many people's pockets. Now the tricks are becoming more and more sophisticated. When selling medicine price lists, they deliberately lower the prices. When you go to buy from them, they reply that it is sold out. Even worse, they deliberately report the wrong price, causing people to waste phone fees. As for soliciting medicine price lists, they deliberately increase the prices. It doesn't matter whether you sell or not, the banknotes are still in his hand. If you have medicine and want to sell it to him at the solicited price, he will reply, "We have bought enough!" In this way, they stubbornly raise the price of medicine higher and higher. In the hands of the shop assistants, the value of the ticket-goods has changed from one yuan to fifty or sixty yuan!</p>
<p>There was an elderly Buddhist woman who had more than one hundred thousand yuan in her hand. Her vision was not bad. Before January 28th of last year, she took out more than five thousand yuan to buy one hundred thousand Kuning pills. Unfortunately, it was destined that the January 28th Incident would come! The old woman was terrified and quickly wanted to sell the pills. She asked people here and there, and finally sold them. She didn't lose money, nor did she make money. Recently, Kuning pills, because the pharmacy assistants learned from the Jews, have risen greatly. The old woman often points to a newly built Western-style house next door and says, "If my pills hadn't been sold, this house would be mine by now. You know that the house price is only 130,000 or 140,000 yuan, and the price of 100,000 Kuning pills is now more than that." The old woman not only wants to take medicine as a meal, but also wants to build a house on medicine. Although there are many people like this old woman, the shop assistants are still wishfully thinking, "Everyone in the world is poor, but I am rich!"</p>
<p>Let those who take medicine as a meal continue to take medicine as a meal. I advise the doctors who truly treat diseases to see through the tricks of the hoarders and not to prescribe medicines from the hoarders' inventory. There are many substitutes for certain brands of medicine. For example, the medicine for treating dysentery and stomach pain, "Teling," actually sells for more than twenty yuan per pill. Please consider, doctors, that this article I have written is not worth a single "Teling" pill. In fact, Chinese pharmaceutical factories have powder preparations that can be used instead of "Teling," it's just that the brand is different. Please prescribe cheap and effective medicines, that would be greatly appreciated. As for the general public, please don't be superstitious about certain medicines being more effective. Know that there is more than one type of medicine for treating colds and coughs. "Biling" is not necessarily "Biling," so why bother spending more than sixty yuan to buy one? Other medicines also have cheaper alternatives. In short, don't be superstitious about a certain brand, as long as it can truly cure the disease. In this way, the hoarder's inventory of medicine-as-a-meal will be reduced by at least half. (Licorice)</p>

<h3>General Response to Those Appealing for Help with Poverty and Illness</h3>
<p>This column has received a continuous stream of letters from readers stating that due to the high cost of living, they are unable to afford medical expenses. In the past month, we have received over 300 letters of this kind. We are aware that the situations described by the appellants are likely to be true. Most of those who are poor and unable to afford medical treatment are those who rely on manual labor to support their families. Failure to provide treatment will affect their entire family life. The elderly will lose their support, and the young will lose their reliance. However, this column lacks specialized knowledge of both Chinese and Western medicine, and it is impossible to prescribe appropriate medicine based on the conditions described in the letters. After much consideration, we have been appealing to major hospitals and doctors in this city on behalf of those in need since the 16th. Since the 17th, we have received two responses from hospitals and doctors willing to provide free medical care to the poor and sick. These will be published in successive issues. We hope that the poor and sick will read them carefully and not simply beg for free treatment. It is important to know that social charitable work must be cherished by the public in order to be sustained in the long term. Even if one receives social assistance due to inability to afford treatment today, once one recovers and is able to make a living, one must find ways to repay those who provide free treatment, so that charitable hospitals and doctors can continue to serve other poor and sick people. All future letters from patients will not be answered individually. - Service Column</p>

<h3>Aurora Charity Football Final: Hequn Red Loses to French Police 3-0, Championship to French Police</h3>
<p>The Aurora Cup charity football match was held yesterday afternoon at the Aurora Stadium on Lube Street. As a result, Aurora defeated Hequn White 8-0, and the French Police defeated Hequn Red 3-0. In this match, the Jewish referee favored the French Police, causing Hequn Red to lose heart and suffer a crushing defeat. With their strong opponent gone, the French Police have the championship in their grasp. The audience was about three thousand people. In the Aurora vs. Hequn White match, Aurora scored five goals in the first half. In the second half, Hequn White tried to counterattack, but they were unable to do so. Aurora became even more energetic. In the end, Hequn White lost to Aurora 0-8. In the main event, the French Police struck first, scoring a goal in seven minutes. At ten minutes, French Police player Luo Zasaise touched the ball with his hand and was penalized with a penalty kick. Dai Linjing took the kick, but unfortunately missed. At twenty-four minutes, Lie Tanmifu of the French Police came on a solo raid. Jiang Yinsheng, the linesman on the left wing, raised the French flag early for an offside, but the Jewish referee did not understand the rules of the game and acted like a wooden chicken. The Hequn Red players also stopped attacking. The French Police kicked the ball into the empty net. Hequn Red lost heart and hastily ended the first half, with the French Police leading by two goals. In the second half, the French Police's offensive became even more rampant. In the seventeenth minute, French Police player Lao Kestov was injured and replaced by Ai Huibo. Before long, Yuan Kuntian scored again, and the French Police won 3-0 over Hequn Red. This morning at 10:30 AM, Nie Zhongcheng will face Hongyuan to resolve the yellow package (issue).</p>

<h3>Public Bonds Trading Range Widens, Large Batch of Spot Goods Seek Way Out in the Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday's unofficial public bond market continued to fluctuate in a downward trend, and its scope continued to expand. As for the fundamental situation, what exactly is it? Readers must be eager to know. After detailed investigations, it is now known that these spot goods belong to certain large banks, and the number is truly alarming. Apart from one-third that cannot be circulated in the market, the remaining amount is still huge and cannot be supported by the current fragile trading floor. There is no other method or place to sell off besides dumping them on the market, which has already seen over a thousand million, so the public bond market is bearing the brunt. Currently, the market sentiment is still such that a small number of people buy when prices are low, while one side dumps and the other side covers short positions. There are also those who add more after covering, which is not a good sign and should not be ignored. In the future, the more liquid capital there is, the more changes there will be. Yesterday, Xinyuan sold a large amount again, and Tongkang and Dakangcheng were of the same origin. Coldly observing from the sidelines, the situation is clear. As for those buying, apart from covering short positions, there are quite a few who buy low to profit, but there are also those who have already lost money and are adding more to make a desperate gamble. Hongxing and Jiufeng covered short positions very eagerly. Yitai, Gongmao, and Lemao absorbed a lot. The rest, such as Shunli, Tongshun, Runde, Hu Heji, Renchang, and Zhongfu, also bought a small amount, but each group still sold eagerly. Hongda, Shuntai Qingcheng Tongyuan, Xufeng, Lianyi, and Dechang all sold. The goods received by the buyers are all new notes and joint numbers, which is unusual. As a result, the market price, apart from Type A, which rebounded slightly by 60 cents due to falling by 3 yuan the day before, the rest still fell by several dimes to 1.3 yuan. The transaction volume was about 1.4 to 1.5 million yuan. A brief table is listed below: Category, Highest, Lowest, Closing, Compared to the previous day. Unified A, 64.90, 63.50, 64.80, up 0.60. Unified B, 59.00, 58.00, 58.80, down 1.30. Unified C, 58.40, 56.50, 58.40, up 0.20. Unified D, 53.10, 52.50, 52.50, up 0.50. Unified E, 55.50, 54.50, 55.00, up 0.70.</p>
<h3>Foreign Shares Continuously in Demand</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rise in foreign shares was still sharp. A total of 30,710 shares were traded, with Shanghai Wool the most popular, with 9,000 shares traded. The price rose from 9.5 yuan to 10.05 yuan, a huge increase of 9.5 dimes. 5,000 shares of Zhongfang rose from 18.1 yuan to 23 yuan, an increase of more than 5.5 yuan. 1,200 shares of Jardine Matheson Textile Mill opened at 36 yuan and rose to 37.25 yuan, an increase of 2.5 yuan. 2,500 shares of Sino-British from 14.2 yuan to 14.5 yuan, an increase of 1.6 yuan. 3,500 shares of Yeguang rose by 5 dimes to 25 yuan. 1,800 shares of British Union at 26.25 and 26.5 yuan. 1,500 shares of Asia Navigation at 9.3 yuan. 500 shares of Jardine Matheson Brewery at 10 yuan. 500 shares of Ken Zhi at 35 yuan. 200 shares of Zilaihuo at 16 yuan. 300 shares of Kaiping at 51.5 yuan. 100 shares of Xiangtai Timber at 29 yuan, an increase of 2 yuan. 1,000 shares of Yangzi at 13 yuan. 10 shares of Power Preference at 110 yuan. 300 shares of Langezhi at 18 yuan. The rest were not traded.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stock Market Shows Strong Performance</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market showed a strong performance. Xinya (New) at 32.25 yuan, Zhongfa (New) from 52.5 yuan, rebounded to 53 yuan. Shenghua Preference at 17.75 yuan had buyers.

<h3>Cotton Yarn Buyers in High Spirits, On the Other Hand, Rapid Rise Causes Several Bears to Become Stranded</h3>

This is because the stock of spot goods is drying up day by day, so buyers are very interested. 42 count Blue 100 yuan, 60 count Sunlight 20,400 yuan, 60 count Lima 20,000 yuan, 42 count Baoguang 10,000 yuan, 42 count Xiantao 10,220 yuan to 10,280 yuan, 40 count Earth 8,800 yuan, 40 count Colorful Ball 9,600 yuan to 9,700 yuan, 40 count Sunlight 9,700 yuan, 20 count Double Horse 5,020 yuan to 5,100 yuan, 20 count Double Earth 5,100 yuan to 5,200 yuan, 20 count Tiannv 5,050 yuan to 5,100 yuan, 20 count Hongxi 5,400 yuan, Fengnian 5,500 yuan, 20 count Yueqin 4,960 yuan to 5,200 yuan, 20 count Shuiyue 5,550 yuan, 20 count Lanfeng 5,900 yuan, 10 count Red Double Horse 4,040 yuan to 4,150 yuan, 10 count Boy Scout 3,990 yuan to 4,100 yuan, 6 count Bumblebee 4,750 yuan, 8 count Boy Scout 4,700 yuan, 10 count Red Baoyi 3,840 yuan, 10 count Songhe 3,750 yuan. 20 count Double Horse factory single opened at 4,270 yuan, then due to profit-taking, and after continuous crazy increases, several bears have become stranded, so the trading floor turned loose and fell to 4,170 yuan, but the spot goods situation is good, and it rose again to 4,280 yuan, closing slightly flat at 4,240 yuan. After closing, it rose to 4,310 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coarse and Fine Cloth Difficult to Sell</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market opened steadily in the morning, subsequently rising continuously in the east. Buyers were eager, and factory orders increased the fastest. Twelve-pound "Fortune" fine cloth was bid at $155, with spot bank orders rising from $192 to $195. "Great Roc" fine cloth was at $198, and "Globe" fine cloth at $202. Sixteen-pound "Globe" coarse cloth was at $230, with no sellers. "Flying Goose" coarse cloth was at $213, with transactions. "Cheese Forest" was at $310, "Peach Girl" at $315, "Longevity Mansion" silk at $6.50, "Three Sheep Stripes" at $6.60, and "Plain Silk" at $6.15. Due to seasonal demand, sales were brisk.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Initially weak due to yarn fluctuations, it rebounded due to low inventories, showing a strong trend. Twelve-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth opened at $239 for new orders, falling to $237 before rising again to $241.50 at noon closing. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday, but off-market transactions were reported at $242. Old shop orders were at $222, "Colorful Ball" fine cloth at $220, "Yang Crane" at $218, and "Baby Diagonal" at $200. "Four Gentlemen" serge red warehouse orders were exceptionally popular, exceeding yellow shop orders, closing at $7.40 at noon. October to December yellow shop orders were at $7.30.</p>
<h3>Xuanwei Woolen Cloth Is in Season</h3>
<p>Xuanwei woolen cloth sales are currently in season, especially for Western clothing tailors, leading to brisk retail sales. Light gray and white plain Xuanwei are selling particularly well, as buyers can sell them as soon as they purchase them. However, herringbone patterns are slightly stagnant, while dark-colored stripes are also in demand. Due to shortages, various shops are actively sourcing them early. The main reason for the high prices is the shortage of inventory. Although prices are rising frequently, demand remains strong. It is easy to quote prices but difficult to replenish stock, making it a perpetual "kick the can" business. Yesterday, Xuanwei woolen cloth from this factory sold for $170-180 to $200 per yard, Eastern goods for $180-190 to $230, and Western goods for $200 to $260-270.</p>
<h3>Cash Slightly Higher</h3>
<p>Cash was slightly higher in the dark market, with a slight increase amid stability. Transactions were sparse, totaling around 100 taels. Certificates were sold by a certain jewelry store, with gold shops and silver shops helping with purchases. Prices initially reached $18,050, then $18,070 and $18,080, and later $18,100, showing an upward trend. Compared to the previous day, the price rose by $50. At noon, demand exceeded supply at the above prices. Jewelry gold was still listed at $1,100 per tael by major new dealers (purchases were reduced by $200). Silver bullion was listed at $18, and the black market price was $13.67. Silver coins were at $8.23 per coin, all stable. The discount rate of the Money Dealers Association continued to rise by two cents, reaching $0.11. The spot discount rate remained at around $25 per thousand, the same as the previous day.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies in a Stable Situation</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw stable British and American gold pounds, with the former at $430 and the latter at $440. The U.S. dollar rebounded by over one dollar, rising to $31. Hong Kong notes were stable and firm, with large notes at $4.60 and small notes at $4.70. Japanese military notes rose from $7.48 to $7.51, then suddenly fell to $7.39, eventually settling at $7.48, a rise of three cents.</p>
<h3>Bank Reserves Association Investigates Bank and Firm Reserves</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Industry Joint Reserve Committee, in order to understand the current situation of banks and firms in the city, yesterday specifically investigated the paid-up capital, public reserve funds, and the amount of old legal tender cash and old legal tender current deposits (excluding interbank deposits) in the vaults of all banks and firms in the city as of the end of the thirty-year final accounts on March 7th, March 21st, and April 11th. It also investigated current deposits (old legal tender cash, excluding interbank deposits), cash in vaults (old legal tender cash), and the amount of cash in money storages (old legal tender cash) as of February 14th, as well as interbank placements (Central Reserve Certificates), interbank deposits (Central Reserve Certificates), Central Reserve Certificates current deposits (excluding interbank deposits), and Central Reserve Certificates in vaults as of April 10th.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Recently, the price of domestic rice, which had been traded little, has soared due to continuous rain. It seemed to have leveled off slightly the day before yesterday, but yesterday, rumors spread that vendors in the suburbs were scarce and purchase prices were high, causing the price to rise again. Early and late indica rice in the French Concession initially rose from $435 to $440, and then to $443. In the British Concession, it rose from $464-465 to $467-468, a sharp increase of over ten dollars compared to previous prices. While this price is difficult to confirm, it was unexpected.</p>
<h3>Grains Prosper in Unison</h3>
<p>Yesterday's grain market saw prosperity across the board, as strong demand from local shops and eager sellers led to brisk sales. Yellow soybeans rose by $3-5, broad beans and red beans rose by $5-6, and corn rose sharply by $6-7. Soybean cakes continued to rise, with Shanghai Pudong beans (30 bags) at $229, Pinghu small yellow soybeans (50 bags) at $224, Benniu red beans (20 bags) at $196, Chongming sand red beans (200 bags) at $206-208, sand broad beans (over 100 bags) at $145-148, Wujiang picked green beans (50 bags) at $196, Hankou soybean cakes (500 pieces) at $39.50, Lizi soybean cakes (March new order, 500 pieces) at $52.75, Feizi soybean cakes (November order, 1 wagon) at $48.30, and Shengji soybean cakes (4,005 pieces, April new order) at $55.20, May old order at $48.30-49, and June old order at $49.50-49.20, September old order at $50.</p>

<h3>Longkou Vermicelli Rising</h3>
<p>Longkou vermicelli is increasingly scarce recently, and most of the inventory is concentrated in the hands of several firms, so the market has risen again and again. The current market is more than one hundred dollars higher than at the beginning of this month, and Qingdao vermicelli, which is inferior, has also risen by thirty or forty dollars. The market situation is very stable.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Transactions Still Brisk, Market Prices Not Much Different</h3>
<p>The cigarette market situation is such that each person's views differ, resulting in brisk buying and selling.

<h3>Areas of Mutual Dissatisfaction Between Husband and Wife</h3>
<p>— Matchmaker</p>
<p>One party in every couple often feels dissatisfied with the other. There are many reasons for this. Now, based on the points of mutual dissatisfaction listed in a foreign magazine, I will write them below in order of their severity. In addition to blessing "May all lovers in the world be married," I also wish all marriages under heaven to be happy!</p>
<p>Husband's Dissatisfaction with Wife:</p>
<p>Such as unreasonable demands; lack of affection; excessive selfishness; too much practicality; interfering with husband's hobbies; untidy appearance; easily angered; interfering with husband's plans and career; arrogance; insincerity; too easily angered; too fond of criticism; narrow-mindedness; neglecting children; poor at managing household affairs; too argumentative; having bad habits; infidelity; spoiling children; poor at managing finances; too many relatives; insufficient income, etc.</p>
<p>Wife's Dissatisfaction with Husband:</p>
<p>Such as selfishness; lack of career success; dishonesty; too much blame; not showing affection; inability to talk openly; being too harsh with children; impatience; lack of interest in children; lack of interest in housework; lack of affection; rudeness; lack of ambition; nervousness or intolerance; too much criticism; poor at managing finances; narrow-mindedness; infidelity; laziness; talkativeness; too many relatives; easily swayed; economic tightness, etc.</p>
<p>If we correct ourselves based on the above small statistics: if husbands develop their careers well and are sincere in everything, and if wives can reduce some unreasonable demands and express more of their emotions, then family life will surely become happier and more fulfilling.</p>
<h3>A Review of Children's Picky Eating Psychology</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhong</p>
<p>In general families, it is often seen that children eat this but not that.</p>
<p>There are only two reasons for this picky eating:</p>
<p>One is that the child has a stomach problem. To put it "newly," they must be treated immediately with injections and medicine; but in my personal experience, I have not yet seen a child who does not pick and choose after treatment. However, this cannot be ruled out as one of the reasons.</p>
<p>The second is what the author wants to review today, which is entirely "spoiled" by the parents! Let's start with an example:</p>
<p>A relative has two only sons. Because they are "only sons," they protect them and let them have their way in everything. At first, he refused to eat medicine celery, saying it had a medicinal taste. As a result, his parents did not allow any medicine celery to be brought into the house. If they ate at someone else's house and there was medicine celery on the table, before the child even said "disgusted" or "won't eat," his parents would say, as if it were the ultimate honor: "My ×× doesn't eat medicine celery." Later, the child kept increasing the number of dishes he wouldn't eat. Pig stomach has an odor and he won't eat it. Pig kidney has an odor and he won't eat it. Lamb also has an odor and he won't eat it... Counting it for him, there are more than a dozen! But his parents remained the same and did not think of ways to make him eat it. — Some of them he had never eaten at all. — Once, his mother accidentally gave him pig stomach soup to eat, and he ate it very greedily, not noticing any odor. But when his mother found out and told him, he immediately stopped eating and even cried.</p>
<p>From this fact, we can know that picky eating in children is a psychological effect — or, to put it bluntly, it is a "spoiling" effect — at work. As for the reason, I think it is like this:</p>
<p>Every child has a desire to win and a heart that often loves to act spoiled, especially children whose parents do not properly discipline them. If once, a child demands that his parents give him something else because there is no good dish, and the parents immediately make some other dishes for him according to his wishes, the parents are of course doing it for the sake of loving him, for the sake of not wanting to watch their children go hungry; but from the child's perspective, he thinks this is an excellent means of coercion; so he does it again and again, and of course he doesn't want to eat that dish anymore. If the parents often say in front of the child, what they think is glorious, and indirectly encourage him, or if some irresponsible people say "he's still young," how can this child not dare to try other things? Another type is when children hear others say that this is not delicious and that has an odor. Children basically don't understand anything, and think this is very interesting, so they also learn to do it. Over time, it becomes a habit.</p>
<p>I think the above two points are probably the most important reasons! Other issues such as environmental problems, such as the first time a child tries something and develops an aversion to it, are also factors, but in summary: it is mostly man-made and not a "disease."</p>
<p>Parents, please pay attention to this point and immediately correct your children's environment and habits! However, we cannot say that we will slowly wait for the child to grow up and then correct him, or wait for him to correct himself; we need to do it decisively. The author is not a proponent of "only beating and scolding," but he is also not a proponent of "only enticing and coaxing"; because when it comes to eating, there is only eating and not eating, and there is no reason why eating and not eating each account for a certain percentage. I believe that the way to make them eat is to combine it with other delicacies for the child to eat, or not tell him beforehand and let him forget about it over time. In a word: it is to use the "law of transference" in psychology.</p>
<p>The above is just the author's personal opinion, to contribute to all readers, — of course, not just for relatives, — and I hope everyone will discuss it and find a satisfactory solution. Because a person who lives without eating this or that is so unfortunate for himself and so inconvenient for others, even to the point of disgust!</p>
<h3>After My Family Moved to the Countryside</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>Since the start of the war and the rise in prices, the burden on my family has become heavier day by day. In order to survive, we naturally had to find a way to make money, but with no way to increase income, we could only reduce expenses. After rice rose to more than twenty dollars a dan, our first step in saving was to dismiss the maid. Then we reduced the size of our house, canceled breakfast, and switched to eating biscuits and steamed buns for breakfast. Finally, we moved the family to the countryside.</p>
<p>Originally, it would certainly be more economical to have the family in the interior, but if I moved the family back to the countryside, I would still have to rent a house and prepare meals, which would be less economical than living in Shanghai. I could only reluctantly entrust my family to this bustling city. Based on my income, I was fundamentally not worthy of being a resident of Shanghai. The reason why this problem could not be solved was that my personal food and lodging were a last resort.</p>
<p>Until the Double Tenth Festival the year before last, I took on a knitting job at another school, which provided food and lodging. At that time, looking at the prices in Shanghai, which were rising day and night, I decided to move my family to the countryside and let me live in Shanghai alone. In terms of expenses, I could save some money. And at that time, the reason why I wanted to return home and move was not only to save expenses, but also because my wife was about to have another child. Since the maid was dismissed, all housekeeping work was done by her alone. Naturally, she could no longer work in the midst of her pregnancy.</p>
<p>It has been a year and a half now. A year and a half is neither long nor short, but in this year and a half, the rise in prices has been unexpected. When I moved back, rice was only sixty dollars a dan and firewood cost only two or three dollars a month. Now rice is almost three hundred dollars and firewood costs one dollar a day. Other items such as daily necessities go without saying. I initially estimated that monthly expenses of seventy dollars would be enough, but now three hundred dollars are indispensable, and we still eat some porridge and vegetarian dishes every day.</p>
<p>In the past few semesters, salaries in the education sector have also increased, but the increases have always failed to keep up with prices. Now my wife is also teaching. The money earned by both of us is used to maintain the household, and we are often living beyond our means. My wife's letters always say that the price of rice has risen again and that if it continues to rise, she fears that we will not be able to survive! Relatives and friends always say to me when they see me that I am a smart person who had the foresight to move the family back to the countryside early, so I can avoid the suffering of husking rice and pressing oil today. But how would they know that the cost of living in the interior is not much different from Shanghai, and we are also living in hardship!</p>
<h3>Why Do Movie Star Couples Get Divorced?</h3>
<p>— Xin Juan</p>
<p>Hollywood has beautiful stars, touching movies, and beautiful scenery. In addition, there are endless fashionable divorce cases. In the past year, there have been many new marriages, such as Bette Davis with Farnsworth, Lucille Ball with Desi Arnaz, Deanna Durbin with Paul, William Holden with Brenda Marshall, Judy Garland with David Rose, Constance Bennett with Gilbert Roland, etc.; there are also imminent good news, such as Cary Grant with Betsy Drake, Tony Martin with Lana Turner, etc.; however, there are also many divorces. Recently, Errol Flynn's wife filed a divorce in court on the grounds of "mental cruelty." Errol Flynn and his wife have always been very loving, and it is incomprehensible that they have now gone to court.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why celebrities are prone to divorce: one is the rumors and gossip spread by newspapers, magazines, and idlers; the second is their temperament; and the third is their social life. The above three points can be said to be the main reasons for divorce.</p>
<p>In the family, couples often have rifts due to conflicts. Louis Hayward and Ida Lupino paid close attention to this point. They knew how to avoid each other's unpleasantness. They have the same hobbies, and they are both very open and honest. When everyone has a movie to shoot, they live in separate houses to avoid being troubled by the hard work. They respect each other everywhere and try their best to forget that they are great stars. Therefore, they have never quarreled in the three years they have been married. Perhaps this is because they understand the "way of husband and wife"!</p>

<h3>A Week's Home-Style Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Recently, for some unknown reason, the price of pork has become frighteningly expensive, reaching a high of ten dollars per catty. These days, it is still about seven and a half dollars, making people dare not even think about eating meat! Thinking back to five years ago when one dollar could buy three or four catties, it was truly the golden age! But although pork is expensive, my menu cannot do without it, so I have to ask everyone to buy two or three dollars' worth every day (one dollar is the minimum amount; meat stores will not sell you less), add more supplementary ingredients, stir-fry the shredded pork, and satisfy your hunger. The freshest item is water chestnut with shredded pork. This thing looks like small water bamboo shoots, with a shell on the outside, and costs about one dollar per catty. If you add some shredded bamboo shoots, then buying half a dollar's worth of water chestnut and two dollars' worth of pork can also suffice for two meals, day and night.</p>
<p>Monday</p>
<p>Water Chestnut with Shredded Pork, Preserved Vegetable Stewed Yellow Croaker, Stir-Fried Baby Bok Choy, Bamboo Shoot with Chopped Horse-tooth Fern</p>

<h3>"What to Do After Divorce?"</h3>
<p>— He Ru</p>
<p>— Some Minor Suggestions</p>
<p>What to do after divorce? Almost every divorced woman thinks this way.</p>
<p>Ms. Zu Ying pointed out three paths, but based on her "year and a half of trial," she saw "No Thoroughfare" signs hanging on every path, and became disappointed and passive. She thought about suicide, three times. ...</p>
<p>This is indeed something that should be sympathized with and helped! But besides sympathy, we also have anger! We see that the bloodless customs and systems are forcing a young woman "only twenty-four years old" to a point where there is no way to go, resulting in three suicide attempts. Thinking about Ms. Zu Ying, and thinking about one's own future happiness, one should retaliate. That is to say, regardless of the "blood-spraying words of relatives," regardless of their insults and contempt, regardless of their "obligations to treat even some minor matters as news and spread it from one to ten, and from ten to a hundred," treat everything as if unheard and unseen, and do what you think you can do according to your own wishes. Suicide is only a weak expression of submission. Why should a young person succumb to the collapsing customs?</p>
<p>It is indeed not easy to find a job. "A woman who has not yet graduated from high school" certainly has "not a single place for you to set foot" at this time and in this place, but there is no need to be discouraged or resentful, because there are still ways to remedy the situation. If the family's finances are not a problem, you can use your free time to learn some specialized skills, such as typing, accounting, weaving, sewing, nursing, medicine, wireless electricity, etc., all of which you can learn according to your own interests. With skills, finding a job will naturally be easy, and there are many places that are eagerly in need of skilled talents now!</p>
<p>We don't know whether "good horses" do not "eat grass that has been turned back to," but it seems that "good women do not marry twice" is not necessarily a matter of course: moreover, the great wheel of the times has been pushed to the 20th century today, so why should these stale concepts still be kept in mind? As Ms. Zu Ying said: "What is the difference between a woman's remarriage and a man's remarriage?" In principle, there is no difference. But Ms. Zu Ying was actually "despised"; this is because people's eyes are still fixed on the habits of the old society. However, the times are advancing, and people's thoughts and behaviors should also be advancing. The entire old system has been broken, so what do some idle words and contempt amount to?</p>
<p>These are some minor suggestions. I wonder what Ms. Zu Ying thinks?</p>
