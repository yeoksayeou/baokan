<p>阿根廷京城十一日同盟社電　據華盛頓訊、美國海軍部今日承認珊瑚海之所羅門戰役中、美方有巡洋艦一艘沉沒、另有巡洋艦兩艘、驅逐艦兩艘及運輸艦船一艘受創、關於此戰役之報告、並不完全、而倫敦對此海空戰、尙未有所宣布、聞惡戰仍在進行中、</p>
<p>里斯本十一日海通社電　海軍作戰長官金氏、昨晚在華盛頓發表所羅門戰役之首次官方公報、其結語稱、「預料將有相當之損失」、該公報中解釋戰事甚為困難及複雜、故損失是所難免、</p>
<p>里斯本十一日同盟社電　美艦隊司令官金格、十日發表所羅門海戰戰報如次、所羅門羣島近海作戰、已歷時三日、現仍繼續進行中、該海戰由美太平洋艦隊司令官尼米資大將任總指揮、南太平洋聯合司令官戈姆利中將仟直接指揮、</p>
<p>阿恨廷京城十日中央社電　據華盛頓電、美海軍部九日發表所羅門海戰戰况、稱美軍對日之軍事行動刻仍繼續進行中、美海軍　遭遇日軍强力之抵　、雙方損失之結果、尙未至發表期間、又據合衆社紐約電、美太平洋艦隊司令官尼米資於報告所羅門海戰之經過後、並向美國民呼籲對戰局之嚴重性、應有深刻認識、請國民予軍隊以　大之援助、</p>

<h3>夏季的防疫　時疫發生多刻有飲食不愼强健腸胃自可減少染患</h3>
<p>那厭人的蒼蠅，飛滿了人間，由於它們的來往逐飛，就處處的埋伏了人生的危機。最重要的腸疾病，有：痢疾，腸傷寒等症，偶一不愼，就會被它們把生命剝奪了去的。所以傳染到這種病症的綠故，大多由於飲食的不愼，把這種種，痢疾菌啦，傷寒菌啦！帶到腸裹去，才給它們機會，在人身體中繁殖猖狂起來了，它們的症狀，簡單的寫在下面一點！「霍亂普通稱為虎列拉，是一種最可怕的流行症，可能在很短時期結束了人的生命！輕的只不過吐瀉幾回，頭覺着疼或暈，身體微倦，四肢較冷，約一週卽可痊愈，而重者則每以致命，嘔吐及排洩劇甚，眼窩下凹，指螺下陷，面蒼白，口喝，聲低啞，痙攣等態。但身體衰弱的人，多生此病，假若服了强身補血的「若素」體格强健起來，抵抗病菌強大，絕不能患這種的。</p>
<p>「傷寒」普通約長四週，初週食慾不強，倦怠發燒。次週則熱度加高，約在　氏三十九度及四十度，意識不淸，譫語，舌苔乾燥，暗黑而厚，而舌尖刺離反是，此週最危險，三週時尙不知注意，如腸內遺瘍，甚至出血，穿孔，而溫度則降低，不免處脫而死；但度過三週，無此現象，則四週後體溫復常，諸症象消失？卽均漸次痊愈矣。</p>
<p>「赤痢」普通分赤白兩種，但赤痢較重，而通俗亦稱為痢疾，輕者類似大腸炎，腹部蒼痛，排洩時裹急後重，便中帶黏液質，但重者則腸部生潰瘍，便內有濃血，倦怠無力，無神，排洩次數增多，往往死亡。</p>
<p>總觀以上三種疾病，由於一時的不愼，而這受到很大的痛苦，甚至死亡，敢不戒哉？故古人有言；「病從口入，禍從口出。」誠不謬也，但飲食的謹愼，不能那麼準有把握，現一在，有救星了，比打預防針還可靠方便的，就是那最著名的「若素」，它是最可靠，最安全的預防良藥，如果你不願受到疾病的痛苦。就趕快服用這偉大的若素。「若素」成分爲維他命B强力消化酵素賀爾蒙…等故有特効。（各地各藥房均售）</p>

<h3>高加索的史乘（一）</h3>
<p>在此次蘇德戰爭中，德國勢在必得的高加索有着豐富的自然資源，這包括錳，煤，銅和木材，而尤其電要的是它擁有以巴庫為中心的亞塞培强的油田。在今日提起俄國開始控制高加索的一段歷史有着一種特殊的意義；從這裏我們可以知道俄國和高加索所在地的喬其亞有着多麼悠久的歷史淵源，而描寫此項聯繫的最顯著的例于就是，目下整個的俄國正處於生長在喬其亞的史太林的領導之下。</p>
<p>喬其亞人　是居住於高加索的衆多的種族之一。大概遠在紀元前一世紀，他們已經開始定居於北部高加索的山脈與南部亞美尼亞平原之間。在俄國升至今日的强國地位的數世紀前，喬其亞人已經建立優越的文化，藝術與文藝幾平盛極一時，女王泰瑪拉之中世紀的王國名震遐邇，而她的宮延詩入蕭達勒斯塞佛里（hota　Rustbvaeli）足以被稱為世界最大詩人之一。可是喬共亞的文化猶如乍開乍謝的花朶：整個地說起來，這地方的歷史實在是充滿着火藥氣味的連績不斷的戰爭史。</p>
<p>這應歸因於二個因素：其一是地理上的陣礙。巨大的山林的存在每當賢能的看主去位時使喬其亞分裂為無數的小國；其二是喬其亞人早先的改位基督敎。這使他們在悠久的期間處於不時受强大的回敎國之威脅的窘境。因此當俄國力足以將其勢力伸展至外高加索的時候，他們實在作為被土耳其及波斯壓迫不堪的喬其亞之救星出現的。</p>
<p>俄國和高加索人民的開始接觸遠在其時之前，約在十世紀時變方已有往來；可是眞正稱得上初次接觸的該推十六世紀末葉哥薩克人的侵入帖雷克水之河口周圍的區域。自從那時起，哥薩克人源源流入，而那著名的「哥薩克綫」也就逐漸建立，這日後作為俄國防備來自南方及東南方之侵略的前哨防綫曾發揮極大的功用。『哥薩克綫一因沿帖雷克河全錢的堡壘相繼築成而逐漸增强。這工程至一八三二年始告完成，可是在這以前它已屢次建立奇功。</p>
<p>信奉基督敎的喬其亞因不堪回敎國的壓迫向俄國呼援已歷數世紀之久，可是直到十八世紀中葉俄國才達到足以採取實際行動的强有力的地位。第一次的武力干涉發生於一七六九年。俄方派遣大將托特爾本經過達里亞峽谷穿越北奇山脈，進入喬其亞之首邑的提弗利司，大敗土軍於伊美立西亞。</p>
<p>可是除了表示俄國尙繼有行動之可能外，這並沒有歷久的效果。第二次的事件有着更大的重要性，因為它引起那著名的喬其亞軍公路的起築。在其後的一世紀中它形成俄國與外高加索間交通的唯一主要動脈，喬其亞的伊拉克里第二世要求俄女皇凱塞琳借以援手以便抗拒得寸進尺貪得無饜之土耳其的要求。俄方迅即派遣波頓金將軍，將山間崎嘔不平的馬道改造成可供軍隊迅速調動的軍公路。在北面底端，他將倭拉的喀甫喀斯建成要塞，以防衛這軍公路的起點。至一七八三年十月他已能將軍隊長驅開人提弗利司，而毫無後顧之憂了。</p>
<p>波頓金在其他方面也頗有貢獻。他不但是第一個把俄國殖民從內地引到外高加索的功臣，並且又是將德國殖民導入提弗利司的創議者。他回時又竭力收容不堪土耳其的壓迫紛紛逃入的亞美尼亞難民，以便利用他們的商才以發展俄國的對外貿易。</p>
<p>波頓金遠征提弗利司之後繼着而來的是外交上的難齬和軍事上的頓挫。直到一七九九年被棄守而毀壞的倭拉的喀甫喀斯才被重建，而直到其翌年喬其亞才正式和俄國合併。自從一八○二年名叫齊齊亞諾夫的一個傑出的人才被任爲高加索德司令後，針項聯繫更形增强了。</p>
<p>血統是喬其亞可是却生長於俄國，在任四年直到陣亡於巴川之役為止，齊齊諾夫　示他對於敎育和文化擁有他對於軍事和外交同樣的才幹。可是在他的前面卻橫著訊多難題。喬其亞和俄國的合　必然地意。味着與波斯及土耳其　於小久的敵對狀態。這又使展國勢耳將山居的種族加以　　　出版不可。因爲他們大都信奉　　，一旦俄國與其新的　居發生正面而突時，他們　然有助敵進攻的可能。於是聞始進　山居民族的長期的戰役，　消耗俄國的兵力竟達半世紀之久，同時又調動無數駐明的將領和長官。</p>

<h3>梁仁政旅行抵滬　談華北現狀</h3>
<p>（同盟社訊）石門學務局長梁仁政，此次來華中旅行，業巳抵滬，特於十一日下午九時一刻，在上海電台廣播，題爲將華北實狀吿全國同胞」，茲將其演詞摘要如次。</p>
<p>親愛的全國同胞們，我爲了欲明膫華　實狀，特由華北到這一裏來旅行，今天積此廣播機會，能與親愛的同胞們一談，實在愉決，事變五年來之華北實狀，或者亦爲諸立所樂聞的吧。</p>
<p>蘆溝橋事變后之華北，整個陷於混亂狀態，人民流離失所，土匪蜂起，農村幾陷於停頓狀態，因而都市如北京天津，亦曾鬧過食糧恐慌之慘劇，后於民國二十九年，成立華北政務委員會，自此組織成立后，華北之政治·治安·財政·建設·敎育·諸般政務，淮展急速，先以政治來說，各省主辦縣政人員調練所，在職之縣知事及各縣署之秘書科長一同訓練，非經過此項訓練，不能任命縣知事，如此甌別之結果，無能之投機縣知事已洶汰十之八九，因而各縣縣政進展急速，保甲體制早巳完成，近已着手編制大鄉，預計本年度即可完成，大鄉制度若一經編成，則各鄉均有歲出歲入之豫算，屆時貪官汚吏，劣質村長，將無計施其伎倆矣，華北之大鄉編制，在河北省現已編就的縣份約居百分之八十。</p>
<p>再言華北之治安，治安强化運動自去年舉行以來，至今年六月十五日裁止，分爲四次，第四次治安强化運動乃推動於大東亞戰爭爆發之後，故其運動分爲三大目標，第一目標在喚醒民衆，使民衆腦海中各有排除英美建設東亞之意識，謂之爲「東亞解放」，第二目標爲「剿共自衛」第三目標爲「勤儉增產」，在此期間，華北各地之自衛團，加緊訓練，在第四次治安强化期間最大收穫，乃勤儉增產中之鑿井工作也，河北，河南，山東，山西，四省同時舉行，鑿井總數爲五十萬眼，每縣約千眼之譜，每井一眼，由華北政務委員會免息貸與五十元之貸金，並津貼炭兩噸，以備燒磚之需，此項鑿井工作，現已成功，華北數千年來之旱災問題，於此四次治安强化期間，予以局部之解決矣，因四次治安强化運動之結果，民心大安。</p>
<p>同時華北政委會治安總署叉着手建軍，編成者分駐華北各地，每一士兵皆爲家有恒產稍具知識之良家子弟，蓋係由各縣各村由村長選送之靑年，並須經過考試後始許入伍受訓，華北之警權，亦隸屬於治安總署，設警務署，由王竹林氏仟署長，積極强化警政，如各縣警官警士之訓練，警察所長必詳寨其才能，甄別其資歷，各省並設有驚察所長訓練所，因之各縣之警務人員索質漸次向上，對於保甲之編制，自衛團之訓練，經濟之統制，物費之配給諸當前要政，均能勝仟愉快，</p>
<p>其次再言華北經濟之實狀，由於聯合準備銀行發行　銀券之成功，當聯銀政策推進之初，亦會遭逢諸多困難，但因其主事者埋首苦幹，終於舊法幣絕跡於華北之後，政務委員會復强制統制金融機關，如取締不合法之銀號錢莊，因而華北之銀號錢莊，均自動改業，或互相集股，依法呈請開設銀號銀行奢亦有之，總之，經過如此嚴厲統制後，已將華北之游資，納入正軌，投機營業，早巳肅淸無餘，近更將一切商業組成組合制，一切商品完全實行配給制，售品明碼制，若，岡獲取不法之暴利，即時可受到經濟警察官之取締與制裁，因之物價之平抑，頗收宏效自</p>
<p>其次再將華北之建設及敎育簡單來談一談，事變五年來華北之建設，誠有令人驚嘆不置者，具體的說，第一，石德鐵路已吿修成，這是由河北省南部之石門市（原名石家莊）通達山東要地德州之鐵路綫，此綫橫貫京漢津浦兩綫。</p>
<p>同時並將石太綫，（即正太綫）改成寬軌，因之山西豐富之實藏，直可運至石德綫，冀南一帶之農作物，如棉花小麥花生等重要產物，皆可便利搬運矣，客車亦早巳開通，例如吾人若由上海或靑島赴石門，或去太原，由津浦綫之德州，可改乘石德錢，無須由天津北京繞道矣。</p>
<p>其他建設工作，如釜腸河，永定河，支河之開闢，石津運河之新築（由石鬥至天津），不特利交通，且防水患也，再如新都市之建設，北京東西車站之大改革，徐州，太原，石鬥，邯鄲，保定，小型都市之積極建設，父如街道之开闢，上下水道之完成，公共汽車交通各縣，凡我等理想所及之華北重耍工程，均在着着進展中，即以滄石鐵路及石津運河而言，我國要人，前二十年即有闢修之擬議，其間幾番醞釀，均未見諸事實，今乃成功於軍荒馬亂之中，吾人於此不禁不有所感慨矣。</p>
<p>華北之敎育，較之事變當時，固己進步多多，然較之事變以前，質量均尙有遜色，量的方面，因限於洽安經濟問題，質时方面，則因缺乏知識份子，然近一年來因各地治安逐漸轉捩，量的方面，已有突然孟晋之勢，大東亞戰爭爆發之當時，華北英美各敎會學校均收爲國營，且均巳恢復上課矣，當此炎夏，謹祝全國同胞健康，再見。　（完）</p>

<h3>各劇壇之秋季攻勢</h3>
<p>— 病鳩</p>
<p>海商梨園，夏季沉寂狀態，巳將過去，靜極思動，紛紛作秋季攻勢之準備。調整陣容，羅致新人，爾虞我詐，互獻神通，正如大戰前夕，例有必然之一度沉寂，在此沉寂期間之工作，實較大戰時史爲重要繁劇。目下各劇壇之準備工作，雖尙未系決定階段，大半業已成熟，彙聞）東，付諸公開，（但菊部消息，轉瞬千變，最後決定，尙待事實之證明。</p>
<p>黃金</p>
<p>黃金秋凉陳容，業巳大部就緒，班底如芙蓉草，小三麻子，高雪樵等仍蟬聯，平角方面已聘定果素秋，李盛藻，袁世海，江世玉，艾世菊一行，大約本月下浣啟程來滬，開鑼日期，定九月十日左右。</p>
<p>更新</p>
<p>宋德珠劇團原定演期一月，若叫座不弱，或將蜎聯牛月，下期角色，尙在物色中，目標在鄭冰如或梁小鸞。</p>
<p>天蟾</p>
<p>天蟾主人對於本年秋凉陣容，銳意革新，不惜重金，邀聘平角，與黃金更新等較一短長。約角人員，業巳赴平，角兒內定爲金少山或李萬春，同時更有請梅蘭芳登台傳說，因梅氏與天蟾主人，年前曾有舊約云。（一說巳聘妥于素蓮高百歲等未知孰是。）</p>
<p>共舞臺</p>
<p>仍排本戲，陣容無可更動。</p>
<p>大舞臺</p>
<p>大舞台去年曾約譚富英來滬，頗獲利，今歲擬再請其南下演唱一月，但平滬滙率，年來陡增倍蓰，包銀問題，尙須費一番折衝也。</p>
<p>皇后</p>
<p>皇后改演平劇，雄心勃勃，志趣不小，除派員北上約尙小雲周嘯天外，班底方面，巳聘定趙松樵，程玉普，劉韻芳，葛次江，張月亭等，頗爲堅强整齊。（外傳已約妥程少餘，劉斌崑，王蘭芳，惟程等係黃金基本人物，恐難成事實。）</p>
<p>大上海</p>
<p>大上海改演乎劇之說，甚囂塵上，主持人張善琨馮耿光，目光集中於梅蘭芳一人身上，若梅氏願意出山，則改組爲平劇戲院，不成問題，否則恐將成爲泡影耳。</p>
<p>此外如向演國產電影之中央大戲院，亦擬改演平劇，現尙在籌備中，有聘周信芳登台說，班底陣容尙未確定。總之，今年以電影院片荒關係，無形中予平劇戲院一抬頭機會，惟平角句銀浩大，各項開支巳非昔比，再兼市面呆滯，人民生活不安，各院雖琿精竭慮，鈎心鬬角，第恐結果未能如理想中之美滿耳。</p>
<h3>陳燕燕　黃紹芬　婚變眞相</h3>
<p>— 隱</p>
<p>電影界最近很熱烈的鬧着一件婚變事，影迷們都很關心這案件，筆者探得其眞相，特爲報吿讀者。</p>
<p>婚變主角爲著名影星人稱小烏的陳燕燕，她的丈夫爲攝影師黃紹芬，他倆的結合，係從友誼而進入戀愛，於民國二十六年九月間結婚，因戀愛的結合，度着甜蜜的生活，不久又慶弄瓦，小名「寳寳」，現已五歲。無奈月圓則缺，花好易殘，在去年起，雙方感情日趨冷淡，竟有蹈周璇與嚴華同樣的趨勢。祇因「寳寳」扶養問題，無形中把這事躭擱下來。因爲他倆談妥的辦法，是「實實在十歲以內由陳燕燕扶養，十歲以外由黃紹芬敎育，這一寳寶、從小由燕燕的母親扶領，她想到可愛的外孫女，一滿十歲，要被黃紹芬領去，心上實在難捨，當時遂中止離婚之議，暫以分居相約。消息傳播以後，遂產生不少猜測之辭，再添油加醬地替變方暗曙配上一個對象，本來一件極簡單的事，經此一渲染，平空地造成緊張複雜的形勢。因爲替陳燕燕配上的對象，爲使君有婦而其婦又爲燕燕手帕交，苟明白事理和法律的，必知此二人絕對不能成此理想，從然掀起了許多無情的風波而已。最近數天，袁仰安律師受任陳燕燕的法律顧文廣吿刊在於本報及各日報後，叉引起不少人的猜測，筆者欲明瞭眞相，經多方刺探，方知陳燕燕以前確有與黃紹芬提議離婚的意見，最近事請發展到離奇怪誕的地步，此　暫告中止，而且深居簡出，絕不與外界往來，以免再被飛短流長。至於委請法律顧文的動機，因爲外面造謠的多，使得有法律保障。簡單些說，陳燕燕正在很安靜地過她的夏季生活，絲毫沒有緊張的　態在演進着，外傅如此這般，多半選是空氣的作用。</p>
<h3>清歌消夏記</h3>
<p>— 蘇少卿</p>
<p>戈文生</p>
<p>戈君北平名票，十年前曾在梅蘭芳余叔岩等創辦之國劇傳習所肄業，尃研究余派老生戲，對於靠把及做工戲先稱擅長，在北平近日票友中，爲最能用工求進之人，其地位正似上海之孫鈞卿也。此次因事來滬，曾在黃金表演全齣瓊林宴，爲慈善　體籌款，吾往觀之，問樵起出箱止，身段步伐，甩髮水袖，皆有尺寸，惜因病後噪昔梢低，戈君身材頗高大，若演靠把戲，必更有可觀。是日戈君旣在座，雖病體氣虛，亦不能推辭不唱，結果唱烏盆記「嘆人生」，「好一個」，兩段，純粹余味，小腔甚多云。戈君下問唱法，吾謂；余之柔密處，君得十之八九，可以無憾，但以君身驅之大，衷氣必足，宜再從剛勁錘鍊，剛柔相間，期入上乘。叔岩之用柔，乃萬不得已。夫柔，坤道也，水德也，若以乾剛離火濟之，則盡等盡美矣。自叔岩菊朋運良成冬，凡四十歲以內之伶人票友，無不致柔，吾夕此說，自知不合時宜，然欲救時弊，吾說必有可採，不但爲戈君一人而發。剛之一字，如虎疫盛行之際，人人須打一預防針焉。</p>
<p>戈君唱後，座中客皆相繼起唱，有一大面，一小生，一靑衣，餘皆老生，不必縷述·最後派在卑人頭上來，吾本不敢唱大軸，作殿軍，因衆位屢次囑唱，吾屢次推拖，至此賸吾一人未唱，陳戈二君，慫慂尤力，蓋彼之欲聽吾唱，亦猶之吾欲聽彼也。地主江四先生指定唱桑園寄子之「嘆兄弟遭不幸」四句慢板　簧，昔老譚拿手，小培於此四句亦至得意，每於酒筵間遇知友命唱，則歌此，吾雖不能上追英秀，能與小培並駕，於願已定，恐仍未至也。</p>
<h3>兩新片將獻映</h3>
<p>衰美雲高占非主演之「恨不相逢未嫁時」，巳定於本月二十日起在大光明大戲院公映，此片纏綿曲折，頂料必迎合多數觀衆之口胃，爲王引生平導演傑作。現聞卜萬蒼導演陳雲裳主演之「牡丹花下一，亦巳定於本月二十七日起在大華大戲院公映，此二片爲中聯特選之無上佳片，故分別排與西片戲院，以示隆重。</p>
<h3>聆朱嘯秋之法門寺後</h3>
<p>— 過宜</p>
<p>上星期五（七號）朱嘯秋爲義務戲串演於黃金，余偕金少剛君同往聆焉。嘯秋自漢皋返滬，與余數相晤會，聆其吊嗓者非一，歌喉圓潤，唱腔悉中繩墨，當已嗟其材質兼美，以爲際此梨園格律散墜，頹波日下，後進者競習辨婀軟媚，以逐時投好，乃有斯確乎不拔，粹然一循正軌者，如蒼軍突起於其間，無異聞空谷之音，使人欣喜也。而其粉墨登塲，茲實初次寓目，成績之佳，則叉過於始望，長不可不有一言以助之張目，庶幾異日嘯秋風緣機會，或在上海出演，顧曲者持吾月旦之說，得以略悉其大概云爾。</p>
<p>嘯秋爲湘南世家，躭嗜皮簧，嘗玩票於漢口，聲稱藉甚，同時儕輩，鮮或稍攖其鋒，旋遊故都，遍請益於前輩伶工，磨礱灌浸，日引月長，所造愈邃，於是始有志下海。鄂省名票，先嘯秋下海而有成者爲南鐵生，今嘯秋繼之，足以抗其單行，凡鐵半所有者，嘯秋靡不畢擅，而嗓音淸亮，嘯秋獨得天賦之厚，鐵生弗克及焉。至板槽工穩，亦且駕乎鐵生之上，節節比較，已不翅過之矣。以是夕之法門寺而言，覺其行腔恪守典則，似黃桂秋，然高亢勁挺之處，桂秋遜其應赴從容，嘯秋於此極其拙樸之趣，猶存靑衣風範也。嘯秋越日嘗蒞余寓邸，殷勤謙抑，期余盡言其所未轉，此在嘯秋固備見不恥下問，以能問不能之誠意，顧余何足以益嘯秋哉？惟嘯秋充是自視欿然之志，吾知其今日方發軔而馳，未見其止也。千里空谷，嘯秋之幗興，無異當材難之極選，叉力求進取如此，汲引期勵，是所望於與吾同志者，余雖無似，有非實當吾意，亦不輕許人以可者也。</p>
<h3>海上書塲巡禮</h3>
<p>— 健帆</p>
<p>年來海卜書壇，又呈蓬勃氣象。聽書消遣，惠而不費，在各項娛樂中，代價最爲低廉。而且雅俗共賞，只消耐心靜坐，誰都聽得津津有味！說書人鬵藝走江湖，深入民間，負官揚通俗文化之資，在游藝界中，原有崇高的地位：濟移默化，倒也不容忽視。最近上海租界區內，相繼新設好幾家書塲，連原有的不下十六七家。一般響擋名家，上有應接不暇之勢。我半日酷嗜聽書，如今發一宏願，預備固遊各　塲，把耳聞目見的形形色色，記述下來，供諸同好：</p>
<p>皇富書塲</p>
<p>八月一日來幕的皇宮書塲，設在中區浙江，戲院隔壁弄內，皇宮飯店的禮廳原址。裝修得煥然一新，富麗堂皇！臺上的布幔桌幃，純用黃色，確乎有些像皇宮氣派。一律新製的帆布坐椅，可容聽客二白左右。設備佈置，還算不錯。</p>
<p>皇宮的說書陣容，卻很堅强。日塲，中塲，夜塲，都是一時之選！尤其是日塲，人村濟濟，可說盡是精華，足使聽者過癮咧。</p>
<p>劇壇喜訉</p>
<h3>孫景路與「麗華」訂約</h3>
<p>— 未人</p>
<p>孫景路巳經在和愛的友好的氛圍中離開綠寳了！關於她以後的去路，各方面都在密切的注意，茲經記者探得，孫景路巳與麗華大戲院訂立合同。</p>
<p>麗華大戲院的建造圖樣，完全參照好萊塢最新式的劇院，無論舞豪面，座位，燈光等，在上海還別開生面，譬如關於幕幔，除了外面的絲絨幕以外，另有薄薄的紗慕，而且上面更裝備七色的幻燈，當慕將啟時，四壁燈光，漸漸暗下，中間即有一「靜字出現，繼之，叉有「第一慕」三字出現，如此富有詩一樣靈快的盡面，一定是給臺下的覜衆一種淸凉的刺激。</p>
<p>孫景路與該院訂立合同，一切條件，都已談妥，上演期約在廢曆中秋節（九月十九日左右）。這熱浪侵襲的一月，她正傾其全力，用功地排戲，每一演員，都抱着推進劇運的職志，大家把戲劇看作自己的生命一樣重要。</p>
<p>劇本與導演，尙在保守秘密中，不過據記者　想，他們一定不會草率從事。</p>
<p>以理想的舞臺，有理想的陣容演出，這是上海劇壇的一個喜訊！</p>
<h3>高天偷之新作</h3>
<p>高天倫氏所領導之木偶劇團，在滬公演以來，極得各方稱賞，茲又製成新式木偶二十餘個，專供演著名童話「木偶奇遇記一之用。此劇電影曾在滬上哄動一時，尤其爲兒童所歡迎，今以眞正的木偶演之，其精彩當更百倍，聞高氏現方日夜籌備，大約三星期之後，此劇即可與滬人士相見云。</p>
<h3>短訊</h3>
<p>曉光劇團係名律師陳醒民等創辦，去歲會在蘭心公演狄叫娘，成績良好，不日擬冉公演女人心，必有一番盛況也。</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>八　奈若何</p>
<p>世德堂葉家的人，上自葉二太太，下至喜鵲等等，都在盼望維城歸來，從早晨盼望起，直盼望到夜晚。到黃昏後回來，葉二太太很後悔，吃了午飯，爲什麽不打發何子興上雙橋鎭去呢？到了夜深人靜後回來，葉二太太又後悔，在天黑上來的時候，爲什麼不打發何子興上變橋鎭去呢？但是翠珍卻和何媽倆，一味價安慰葉二太太，說雪停了，說風靜止了，說有阿興跟了去，便把他少爺揹在背脊上揹回來，也容易啊。棄二太太拿維城的留言，在燈下反覆看了幾遍，說道：「維城說我，過幾天會知道他爲什麼到要橋去的。爲什麽過幾天我才能知道，又爲什麼我現在不能知道。」她自己在咕噥着，卻不許何媽喜鵲等竊竊私語。她的意思，是維城倘然在外邊叫門，給你們說話聲音，擾亂了他的打門聲音，可就聽不出來。她聽自鳴鐘鳴了十二下，要喜鵲扶她出去，到大門外，看維城是不是在回來。葉二太太往昔，在世德堂的新婦班子裹，是比葉大太太精明，今天晚上，爲了酷念着維城在外的安全問題，忽然情感把她的理智征服。雖然經過翠珍解說：「大門外是漆黑一團，看不見什麽的。她說：「地下堆滿了雪，怎麼會看不見？翠珍說：「深夜不回來，一定是傲陳少爺陳小姐留住了，到大門外去看，也楚徒然。」她說：「便是維城給他們留住了，阿興是可以回來的。我看見阿興，就像看見我的兒子回來。」翠珍見勸解無效，便立刻要何媽打起燈籠來，送葉二太太到門外去。何媽提了燈籠在前，左邊喜鵲，右邊翠珍，法住了葉二太太往外走，長工徐全福，開了大門開了籬門等着。大門外是一片自，望遠處又是一團黑，別說維城阿興杳無消息，連不相識的行人，一個都沒有。一陣旋風，幾乎把燈籠裹的洋蠟都吹熄了。這不得不使葉二太太廢然而返。　（一五二）</p>

<p>Lisbon, 11th (Haitong News Agency): Chief of Naval Operations King issued the first official communiqué last night in Washington regarding the Solomon Islands battle, concluding, "Considerable losses are expected." The communiqué explained that the battle was very difficult and complex, so losses were unavoidable.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 11th (Allied News Agency): U.S. Fleet Commander King issued a report on the Solomon Islands sea battle on the 10th as follows: The battle near the Solomon Islands has lasted for three days and is still continuing. The sea battle is under the overall command of Admiral Nimitz, Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, and directly commanded by Vice Admiral Ghormley, Commander of the South Pacific Joint Forces.</p>
<p>Argentine Capital, 10th (Central News Agency): According to a Washington dispatch, the U.S. Navy Department issued a report on the Solomon Islands sea battle on the 9th, stating that the U.S. military operations against Japan are still continuing. The U.S. Navy encountered strong resistance from the Japanese forces. The results of losses on both sides have not yet reached the point of being announced. According to a United Press New York dispatch, after reporting on the Solomon Islands sea battle, U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz also appealed to the American people to have a deep understanding of the severity of the battle situation, and requested the people to give the military great assistance.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Allied News Agency): According to a Washington message, the U.S. Department of the Army has announced the names of 77 American soldiers missing in action in the Pacific, mostly airmen, including 10 officers and 27 soldiers missing in action in Alaska, 5 officers and 20 soldiers missing in action in Midway, and 6 soldiers missing in action in Hawaii.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Allied News Agency): According to a Washington dispatch, U.S. naval authorities announced that U.S. naval and air forces attacked the Japanese-occupied Western Aleutian Islands on the 8th. According to this report, it is different from past false propaganda; it does not mention a word about the results of the battle, and the reporting agencies in the U.S. and the U.K. only state that the details are unclear. A San Francisco broadcast claimed that the attack has ended, but the results cannot be known until the U.S. troops return to base, and it will take two weeks to determine.</p>
<p>Kamada Reveals Japanese Navy's Night Battle Victory Yesterday</p>
<p>Allied News Agency, Local Report: Japanese Navy Spokesman Colonel Kamada stated yesterday while receiving reporters that the reason for the U.S. Navy's rapid defeat in the Solomon Islands battle was because the battle occurred at night. Colonel Kamada revealed for the first time that the battle occurred at night, and said that this naval battle has completely exposed the U.S. Navy's weakness in this regard. The U.S. fleet was quite surprised to suddenly encounter Japanese ships because what they expected was to deal with Japanese air raids. Many U.S. ships did not even have time to aim their guns at the Japanese ships, which shows that it was a complete surprise. As a result, the Japanese ships broke through the U.S. transport lines and inflicted heavy damage. The U.S. fleet's night battle training was poor, which completely put them at a disadvantage. To win in night battles, all crew members must undergo rigorous training, but the U.S. side was not suitable for night battles because their ships lacked searchlights. Due to the Allied powers' deliberate distortion of propaganda, it is clear that they still underestimate the strength of the Japanese Navy. The Allied side has suffered defeats in the past, but still stubbornly underestimates the strength of the Japanese Navy, which must be due to the fact that U.S. officers and soldiers do not know the truth about the past defeats. In response to questions, Colonel Kamada further revealed that the fleets were extremely close when they engaged in battle, and sometimes the warships almost collided.</p>
<h3>Prominent Japanese Naval Expert Explains Significance of Solomon Islands Sea Battle</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency): Renowned Japanese naval commentator Masanori Ito recently commented on the significance and great results of the Solomon Islands sea battle, stating that the enemy had proclaimed Australia as the only remaining base for offensives against Japan in the Pacific, pinning their last hope on Australia, thinking that it might be possible to reverse the entire Pacific war situation. However, our imperial army finally subdued the Solomon Islands, which are located to the east of Australia and New Guinea, and are a vital hub for U.S. and Australian maritime communications. Recently, our navy attacked the Arafura Sea to the northwest of it, making the situation of the isolated Australia even more difficult, proving that the talk of an offensive against Japan is just an illusion. As a result of despair and anxiety, the British and Americans believe that it is necessary to strengthen Australia's defense and transport a large number of U.S. Army troops. According to announcements, their transport team consists of one battleship, seven or more Class A cruisers, three or more Class B cruisers, and six or more destroyers, and is accompanied by a strong escort fleet. From their all-out efforts to protect it, we can infer that there are more than ten transport ships, carrying a considerable number of large units. The United States is betting everything, as can be seen from the general situation. The strength of the U.S. escort fleet this time can be said to be unprecedented. The strength of the British escort fleet that was bombed by Italy in the Mediterranean was only half of this time. After the U.S. aircraft carrier was bombed and destroyed by us, only three remain. The reason why no aircraft carrier was deployed in this escort fleet is precisely because of this. The greatness of the results achieved by our army in this naval battle exceeds the battles of Hawaii and Malaya. In this battle, the enemy had one battleship and seven Class A cruisers damaged. This is indeed a wound that the U.S. cannot quickly recover. What we should emphasize now is this. The destruction of the U.S. escort fleet will have a profound impact on the transportation of ground troops for combat in the future. In terms of opening up a second front in Europe, the transportation of ground troops by sea is a prerequisite. This was the first time that the British and Americans had cooperated in transporting troops, and it was destroyed in one fell swoop, defeated without a fight. The elite of the U.S. Army on the transport ships has suffered a terrible fate, so this defeat not only severely damaged the British and American navies, but also inflicted a painful blow on their armies and people. The U.S. Army units that the United States boasts of suffered a setback in their first operation against Japan, so the second front will forever become an unattainable dream, it can be asserted.</p>
<h3>Extremely Chaotic Situation in India; Civilian-Police Clashes Unceasing, with Numerous Deaths and Injuries; Mumbai, New Delhi, and Three Other Cities Are the Most Severely Affected</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 11th (Allied News Agency): According to reliable sources, the anti-British struggles in India are intensifying. The anti-British struggles of the people in Mumbai, Lucknow, Kolkata, New Delhi, and other places have spread to the entire country. The situation in various places is described as follows: Mumbai citizens attacked railway stations on the morning of the 10th, and clashed with police teams, with more than 20 people injured. The people were very indignant at the authorities' violent suppression, so they attacked police teams, damaged telegraph and telephone lines, and post offices. When the police were dispatched to suppress the unrest, they clashed with the people everywhere and opened fire. On the 10th alone, 11 citizens died and 49 were injured. On the police side, 91 people were injured. In Lucknow, students held demonstrations and threw bricks and tiles at the police. Ahmedabad Gujarat University held a rally against the arrest of Gandhi. Indian university students clashed with the police. British troops were dispatched to suppress the unrest. In New Delhi, the people wanted to destroy the Governor-General's residence, and clashed with the police. Workers at the jute mills in Kolkata have begun to strike. On the morning of the 10th in Pune, a large number of citizens gathered around the Aga Khan Palace, where Gandhi and others were detained. The police wanted to disperse the crowd and opened fire, resulting in a bloody battle with the people. At that time, the crowd threw stones at the suppressing troops. Another group of people wanted to gather at the city's Kuomintang branch to hold an anti-British rally. The police opened fire to interfere, and several people were injured. In short, the anti-British struggle in India is raging like wildfire and has spread throughout India. Although the British have banned gatherings, arrested key figures, and dispatched police and troops to suppress the unrest, it is to no avail. The situation is serious and has reached its peak.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 11th (Allied News Agency): The situation in India is deteriorating daily. In Mumbai alone, 15 people have died and 169 have been injured in the two days of Sunday and Monday. The number of deaths and injuries throughout the country is increasing with time. A curfew has been implemented in northern Mumbai. Police are stationed at all stations to prevent National Congress activities. The ban has been extended to Bengal, Madras, and Mysore. Workers at several yarn factories in Kolkata went on strike yesterday. The Dadar oil depot was set on fire and burned. The Mumbai-Baroda and Central India railways were disrupted by students yesterday, and were once unable to operate. Many store windows in New Delhi were smashed, but Old Delhi and New Delhi were relatively peaceful yesterday.</p>
<p>Mumbai, 10th (Havas News Agency): The situation in India has not calmed down today. In many places, there have been continued clashes between the people and the police, especially in the three cities of Mumbai, Lucknow, and New Delhi. The details are as follows: In Mumbai, the people attacked the Tardeo railway station in an attempt to cut off traffic between the city and the suburbs. The police drove the rioters out of the station, but they gathered in the nearby square and moved a large number of oil drums from the station, piling them up in the streets in an attempt to block traffic. At the same time, they threw stones at the police, and the police immediately opened fire in retaliation. Twenty-three people were injured. Several minor clashes also occurred in other parts of the city. The official announced the number of casualties for the two days as follows: Yesterday, 11 civilians died and 49 were injured, 22 police officers were injured, and 69 police officers were injured. Today, 27 civilians were injured. The number of police deaths and injuries is not yet known. In Lucknow, university students ignored the authorities' ban and jointly went on strike to hold demonstrations in the streets. The police attempted to disperse them, and they threw stones at the police like rain. The authorities immediately ordered the opening of fire. The number of casualties afterwards is unknown, only that 13 students were arrested. The situation in New Delhi is also very serious. The crowd stormed through the barbed wire placed on a certain hillside (the Governor-General's residence is located there) and were repelled by the police. Another group of rioters prepared to storm near the Governor-General's residence, but were also blocked by the police. In Karachi, all city markets have been closed. Students at most schools have gone on strike. Singh, the chairman of the Bihar Congress Party branch, has been arrested. Various organizations of the Congress Party in Mysore have been declared illegal.

Various Congress Party agencies in Madras Province have also been declared illegal. Governor Sir Hope of the province, who was on vacation in Ootacamund, flew back to his post today. All demonstrations, mass gatherings, and various political activities are prohibited. Many Congress Party leaders have been arrested.</p>
<p>Saigon, 11th (Haitong News Agency): According to news from Mumbai, in the second disobedience movement in India, disturbances, strikes, and boycotts have occurred everywhere. Universities in major cities have also gone on strike. Currently, the British suppression of the Indian independence movement is even more severe than the measures taken by the British police during the previous civil disobedience movement. Police use tear gas, bombs, and pistols on defenseless people in the streets. In Benares, a group of young students were repeatedly attacked by the police. The demonstrators were dispersed by gunfire, and nearly 30 students were killed or injured. Clashes continued in Pune, where Gandhi and other Congress Party leaders are detained. All entrances to the city are tightly guarded by the police. There are boycott movements in Kolkata, Mumbai, Benares, Agra, Lahore, Hyderabad, and small cities in various provinces. Strikes have occurred in Kolkata and Mumbai, but due to British press censorship, details of the expansion of the strikes are unknown.</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Holds Emergency Meeting to Discuss Indian Issue; House of Commons Does Not Intend to Convene Meeting</h3>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Allied News Agency): According to a dispatch from the Swedish capital, the British Cabinet held an emergency meeting on the morning of the 10th to discuss the Indian issue, which lasted for quite a long time. At that time, the Secretary of State for India, Amery, first explained in detail, based on a report from the Government of India, the process of adopting the resolution of the All-India Congress Committee demanding the withdrawal of British forces, and the situation of disturbances caused by the suppression of the Congress Party, and the situation of the unfolding of the non-cooperation movement. Each member of the Cabinet seemed to have raised questions about this, and the content of the discussion is not yet fully understood. However, judging from the opinions of various London newspapers, there were many differences of opinion in this Cabinet meeting, but apart from being unable to but recognize the tough policy of the Government of India, there seemed to be no results. However, there was strong opposition to this attitude of the government, especially from the Labour Party. The Labour Party also convened a meeting on the 10th for the Indian issue. According to news from the German News Agency, the Labour Party issued a statement after the meeting, greatly criticizing the neglect of the measures taken by the Government of India. The party also demanded that the government immediately convene Parliament to explain the policy of the Government of India. The party's organ, "Report News," also commented on the Indian issue, stating that the result of the government using force to prevent instability has instead accelerated the development of this situation, so the state of unrest in India will be increasingly deepened in the future.</p>
<p>Swedish Capital, 11th (Haitong News Agency): News was received from London late last night that the British House of Commons does not intend to convene a meeting to discuss the situation in India. The Independent Labour Party had proposed convening Parliament, but political circles in London believe that the government is unlikely to accept this proposal.</p>
<p>Swedish Capital, 11th (Allied News Agency): A London message received here today revealed that the Cabinet held an emergency meeting this morning, which lasted for quite a long time, to consider the latest developments. This message is sufficient to reflect the seriousness of the Indian crisis encountered by the Churchill government. During the British Cabinet meeting, Secretary of State for India Amery explained the general situation, followed by a heated debate, but the details have not been disclosed. At the same time, Independent Party leader Maxton demanded that Parliament be reopened to discuss the Indian situation.</p>
<h3>Bose Delivers Broadcast Speech in Germany</h3>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Havas News Agency): Indian pro-Axis nationalist leader Bose delivered a broadcast speech here today to the Indian people, urging all men, women, and children in the country to unite and participate in the anti-British imperialism struggle, stating, "Our leaders Gandhi, Nehru, and other key figures have been arrested for the crime of demanding freedom for India. This kind of measure is not surprising, because many of us have been imprisoned for many years for committing the same crime. Although the British flaunt the banner of 'fighting for freedom and democracy,' it is the British who ordered the arrests, so in fact, the British are only fighting for their imperialist interests. At this time, all countries in the world are expressing sympathy for us, and it is time for us to make the final struggle for our freedom. In this large-scale struggle, all Indians, regardless of men, women, old, or young, must unite as one. We should not stop fighting until we drive the British out of the country and the flag of freedom flies all over the country."</p>
<h3>Summer Epidemic Prevention: Seasonal Epidemics Often Occur Due to Dietary Carelessness; Strengthening the Stomach and Intestines Can Reduce the Risk of Infection</h3>
<p>Those annoying flies fill the world, and because of their coming and going, they hide the crisis of human life everywhere. The most important intestinal diseases include: dysentery, typhoid fever, etc. With just a little carelessness, they can strip away one's life. Therefore, the reason for the transmission of these diseases is mostly due to dietary carelessness, bringing these kinds of things, such as dysentery bacteria and typhoid bacteria, into the intestines, giving them the opportunity to breed rampant in the human body. Their symptoms are briefly written below! "Cholera, commonly known as tiger cholera, is one of the most terrible epidemics that can end a person's life in a very short period of time! Mild cases are just a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea, a headache or dizziness, slight fatigue, and cold limbs, and can be cured in about a week. Severe cases are often fatal, with severe vomiting and diarrhea, sunken eye sockets, sunken fingertips, pale face, thirst, low and hoarse voice, cramps, etc. However, people with weak bodies are more likely to get this disease. If they take the strengthening and blood-tonifying 'Ruosu,' their physique will become strong, their resistance to bacteria will be strong, and they will never suffer from this disease.</p>
<p>"Typhoid fever" usually lasts about four weeks. In the first week, appetite is poor, and there is fatigue and fever. In the second week, the fever increases, around 39 and 40 degrees Celsius, with impaired consciousness, delirium, dry tongue coating, dark and thick, while the tip of the tongue is prickly and detached. This week is the most dangerous. If attention is not paid in the third week, such as ulcers in the intestines, even bleeding, perforation, and the temperature will drop, and death is inevitable; but if the third week is survived without these phenomena, then the body temperature will return to normal after the fourth week, and all symptoms will disappear, and recovery will gradually occur.</p>
<p>"Dysentery" is commonly divided into red and white types, but red dysentery is more severe, and is also commonly known as dysentery. Mild cases are similar to colitis, with abdominal pain, a feeling of urgency and tenesmus during excretion, and mucus in the stool, but severe cases will develop ulcers in the intestines, with pus and blood in the stool, fatigue, weakness, listlessness, increased frequency of excretion, and often death.</p>
<p>In summary, these three diseases are caused by momentary carelessness, resulting in great suffering, even death. How can we not be vigilant? Therefore, the ancients said, "Disease enters through the mouth, and disaster comes out of the mouth." This is indeed not wrong. However, dietary prudence cannot be so accurately guaranteed. Now, there is a savior, which is more reliable and convenient than getting vaccinations, and that is the most famous "Ruosu." It is the most reliable and safest preventive medicine. If you do not want to suffer from the pain of disease, then quickly take this great Ruosu. "Ruosu" contains vitamin B, powerful digestive enzymes, hormones, etc., so it has special effects. (Available in all pharmacies)</p>

The number of unemployed in the city has gradually decreased due to the revival of factories, businesses, and firms.

<h3>Roosevelt's Letter to Stalin: Not Yet Delivered by the U.S. Representative; General Bratton First Receives Reporters, Saying He Has Already Met with Soviet Authorities Four Times</h3>
<p>Moscow, Eleventh Day, Allied News Agency: After U.S. President Roosevelt's representative, General Bratton, arrived here, he received reporters from various countries for the first time yesterday. According to him, President Roosevelt's letter to Stalin has not yet been submitted. The purpose of his visit is purely military in nature, mainly to discuss the acceleration of the supply of U.S. military supplies to the Soviet Union, and has absolutely nothing to do with opening a second battlefield. He has already discussed with the Soviet military authorities in the Defense Committee Office four times, and no representatives from other countries participated.</p>
<p>Berlin, Eleventh Day, Hai Tong News Agency: A German Foreign Ministry spokesman declared last night that Churchill seems to have rushed to Moscow, as Churchill must go abroad whenever the Allied powers encounter new disasters.

<h3>U.S. Ordnance Production Lags Behind; House Defense Committee Releases Report</h3>
<p>Washington, Tenth Day, Havas News Agency: The House Defense Committee released a report today stating that the quantity of U.S. ordnance production is lagging behind the planned schedule. The figures released by the Ordnance Production Bureau regarding U.S. armament and ordnance production do not match the facts. According to the actual situation, the production of certain types of ordnance is far from the plans repeatedly announced to the press by President Roosevelt. The figures and statements repeatedly released by the Ordnance Production Bureau are based on the production figures before the Japanese aircraft bombing of Pearl Harbor, and the gravity of the current situation has not been accurately explained. It is not known that before December 1941, the actual production volume was far below the production capacity. At that time, it was not even thought of completing this great task. In short, the policy adopted by the government for allocating manpower seems extremely clumsy, causing workers to feel as if they are facing conscription or partial mobilization. In fact, mandatory measures are only implemented when it is necessary to transfer workers from a certain industry to more important jobs, and not all of them must be forced.</p>

<h3>A Historical Account of the Caucasus (1)</h3>
<p>In this Soviet-German war, the Caucasus, which Germany is determined to obtain, is rich in natural resources, including manganese, coal, copper, and timber. Of particular importance is its possession of the Baku-centered Azerbaijan oil fields. Today, mentioning the history of Russia's initial control over the Caucasus holds a special significance. From this, we can understand the long historical connection between Russia and Georgia, located in the Caucasus. The most prominent example of this connection is that the entire Russian nation is currently under the leadership of Stalin, who was born in Georgia.</p>
<p>The Georgians are one of the many races residing in the Caucasus. It is believed that they began settling in the mountains of the northern Caucasus and the plains of southern Armenia as early as the first century BC. Centuries before Russia rose to its current position as a powerful nation, the Georgians had already established a superior culture, and the arts and literature were nearly at their peak. The medieval kingdom of Queen Tamar was renowned far and wide, and her court poet, Shota Rustaveli, can be regarded as one of the world's greatest poets. However, Georgia's culture was like a flower that bloomed and withered quickly. Generally speaking, the history of this place is filled with a continuous history of war permeated with the scent of gunpowder.</p>
<p>This can be attributed to two factors: one is the geographical obstacle. The existence of vast mountains and forests caused Georgia to split into countless small states whenever a wise and capable ruler passed away. The second factor is the early conversion of the Georgians to Christianity. This placed them in a long-term predicament of being constantly threatened by powerful Islamic nations. Therefore, when Russia was strong enough to extend its power to the Transcaucasus, they appeared as saviors of Georgia, which was suffering under the oppression of Turkey and Persia.</p>
<p>Russia and the people of the Caucasus began contact long before that time; there were exchanges as early as the tenth century. However, the real initial contact can be traced back to the late sixteenth century when the Cossacks invaded the area around the mouth of the Terek River. Since then, Cossacks have been flowing in continuously, and the famous "Cossack Line" has gradually been established. In the future, this will serve as Russia's outpost defense line against aggression from the south and southeast, playing a significant role. The "Cossack Line" was gradually strengthened as fortresses were built along the Terek River. This project was completed in 1832, but it had already performed many meritorious deeds before that.</p>
<p>For centuries, Christian Georgia, unable to bear the oppression of Islamic nations, had been appealing to Russia for help. However, it was not until the mid-eighteenth century that Russia reached a powerful position sufficient to take practical action. The first military intervention occurred in 1769. Russia sent General Totleben through the Daryal Gorge, across the northern Caucasus Mountains, and into Tiflis, the capital of Georgia, defeating the Turkish army in Imereti.</p>
<p>However, besides indicating that Russia still had the possibility of action, this did not have a lasting effect. The second event was of greater importance, as it led to the construction of the famous Georgian Military Road. In the century that followed, it formed the only major artery for transportation between Russia and the Transcaucasus. King Heraclius II of Georgia requested Empress Catherine of Russia to help resist the increasingly greedy demands of Turkey. Russia quickly dispatched General Potemkin, who transformed the rugged and uneven mountain paths into a military road that could quickly mobilize troops. At the northern end, he built the fortress of Vladikavkaz to defend the starting point of the military road. By October 1783, he was able to drive his troops into Tiflis without any worries.</p>
<p>Potemkin also made other significant contributions. He was not only the first meritorious official to introduce Russian colonists from the interior to the Transcaucasus, but also the initiator of introducing German colonists to Tiflis. When he returned, he also made every effort to accommodate Armenian refugees who were fleeing from Turkish oppression, in order to use their business acumen to develop Russia's foreign trade.</p>
<p>After Potemkin's expedition to Tiflis, diplomatic difficulties and military setbacks followed. It was not until 1799 that the abandoned and destroyed Vladikavkaz was rebuilt, and not until the following year that Georgia was officially merged with Russia. Since 1802, when an outstanding talent named Tsitsianov was appointed as the commander of the Caucasus, this connection has become even stronger.</p>
<p>Although of Georgian descent, he grew up in Russia. During his four years in office until his death in the Battle of Baku, Tsitsianov showed that he possessed the same talent for education and culture as he did for military affairs and diplomacy. However, many difficulties stood before him. The union of Georgia and Russia inevitably meant a prolonged state of hostility with Persia and Turkey. This also made it impossible to fully subdue the mountain-dwelling races, because they mostly believed in Islam, and once Russia had a direct and sudden conflict with its new neighbors, they would naturally be likely to help the enemy attack. Thus began the long-term campaign against the mountain tribes, which consumed Russian military power for half a century, and also mobilized countless famous generals and officers.</p>

To date, a total of 83 inspections of rice stores in the French Concession have been carried out, of which 17 were found to have fraudulent practices in the amount of rice sold, and have been subjected to severe administrative penalties. The inspection work is still continuing, but violations have almost disappeared.</p>
<h3>New Puyutang Faces Financial Difficulties - Deeply Hoping for Donations from All Sectors - Monthly Expenses Total More Than 70,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The New Puyutang provides shelter for more than 1,200 men, women, old, young, disabled, and orphaned people. Over the years, it has received donations from society and barely maintained its expenses. Recently, with the high prices of various commodities, the livelihood of the poor has become even more difficult. The hall cannot bear to refuse to take in refugees who ask for relief, but daily expenses require more than 30,000 yuan per month for rice, more than 10,000 yuan for coal, more than 10,000 yuan for vegetables, and more than 20,000 yuan for water and electricity, totaling more than 70,000 yuan, which is very difficult to maintain. It is learned that in recent months, the hall has received donations from all sectors, but they are still less than half of the expenses. It is deeply hoped that all sectors will enthusiastically donate, so that more than a thousand orphans and elderly people can maintain their lives. Collection points are: Trust Department of the Silk Industry Bank, 460 Hankou Road; Jihua Tang Pharmacy, 47 Yunnan Road; Huamei Pharmacy, 156 Fuzhou Road; Catholic Church, Catholic Church Street, French Concession (also accepts items).</p>

<h3>Three Kidnappers Involved in a Major Case Two Years Ago Arrested - Taking the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce as a Base, the Main Culprit Tang Wanzhi Fled to Other Ports</h3>
<p>Wang Jinsheng, a Chinese detective of the Laozha Police Station, and detectives Ding Yizhong and Liu Yuliang, etc., previously arrested the kidnappers Gao Youyi, Zhou Zhengrong, and Wang Hengyuan, and seized two Mauser pistols and 32 bullets. According to their confessions, they also fished out a No. 4111 car specially used for kidnapping at Xujiahui. After investigation, it was found that Gao and others had committed many kidnapping cases, including: December 29 of the 29th year, kidnapping the owner of Delong Tobacco Company, Wang Weiwan, and his wife at the entrance of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce gambling den at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Haig Road; September 26 of the same year, kidnapping Ying Jipin, the owner of the New China Iron Factory at 815 Xiaoshadu Road; August 24 of the same year, kidnapping Shen Jiucheng, the owner of the Shengsheng Ranch at 175 Daxilu; April 64 of the 30th year, kidnapping the wealthy son Yu Jingqi at the intersection of Moore Hall on Yu Qiaqing Road; etc. Tang Wanzhi (also known as Zhong Yao), the main culprit of these kidnappings, directed all the kidnapping cases. The No. 4111 car also belonged to Tang. It was also found that the two Mauser pistols seized belonged to the former Chinese General Chamber of Commerce gambling den. The den was actually the root of the kidnappers. All wealthy people who went to gamble were under observation, and then kidnapping was planned. It is learned that the Tang criminal fled to other ports, and a secret investigation is underway.</p>

<h3>Wang Jinxiu Jewelry Store Murder Case: Details of the Criminals' Confessions; the Arrested Major Criminal Tang Wenxiang Died in Custody from Illness; Police Department Charges with Murder and Robbery</h3>
<p>Wang Weiyuan, the owner of the Wang Jinxiu Jewelry Store at 521 Xiahui Road, whose daughter, Qu Huide, was living with him, was attacked and injured by Jin Fugen, a native of Pudong and owner of the Changxing Flower Shop at 519 next door, and his accomplices on the night of June 26. Wang's adopted son, Wang Mian, was killed, and 300 yuan in cash was robbed.</p>
<p>Four People Arrested</p>
<p>After the incident, the French police arrested the criminals Jin Fugen, Wang Ruigen, Tang Wenxiang, and Wang Yangshi (Wang Weiyuan's concubine mother), and the shop assistant Gao Shouting. The details have been reported in the newspapers. However, Tang Wenxiang, a major criminal in the case, died in custody from illness. The police department has now transferred Jin and the other criminals to the court. The police department charged Jin Fugen, Wang Ruigen, and others with murder and robbery. Tang Wenxiang, having died from illness, was not prosecuted.</p>
<p>Jin Fugen's Confession</p>
<p>Under interrogation, Jin Fugen confessed that he runs a flower shop. Last month, Tang Wenxiang, a former partner of the plaintiff, met with him in the French Park. He said that the plaintiff's mother, Wang Yangshi, and he had opened the Warner Jewelry Store on Xiahui Road, but the police had unreasonably ordered it to close, mistaking that Wang Weiyuan had instigated it. Therefore, he was angry at the plaintiff and instructed him to find a way to murder Wang Weiyuan. They agreed to borrow two bamboo ladders to connect and place them against the window of the plaintiff's attic room on that night. He then gathered three apprentices from his shop, including Wang Ruigen, and entered the room together. Wang Weiyuan was away in Suzhou. There was only a daughter and a boy in the room. The girl screamed, so he threw a wooden stool at her but missed. Tang Wenxiang then used a stool to knock the girl down on the bed, leaving her dying. Tang then hacked the boy to death. They opened the box and robbed 300 yuan in cash before fleeing.</p>
<p>Two Criminals Detained</p>
<p>Wang Ruigen, 17 years old, confessed that he had been an apprentice at the Changxing Flower Shop for only four months. Jin Fugen asked me to go with him to help with the crime. When I went upstairs, I saw that Jin and the others had already injured a boy and a girl. I went downstairs. I don't know anything else. Wang Yangshi confessed that she lives at 21 Luban Road. Although she learned about the Jinxiu Jewelry Store murder case afterward, she was not involved in the conspiracy. Gao Shouting confessed that he has been working at the plaintiff's shop and knows nothing about the murder case. The court ordered Wang Yangshi and Gao Shouting to be released on bail. Jin Fugen and Wang Ruigen were detained for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Liang Renzheng Arrives in Shanghai After Trip: Talks about the Current Situation in North China</h3>
<p>(Tong Meng News Agency) Liang Renzheng, the Director of the Shimen Education Bureau, arrived in Shanghai after traveling in Central China this time. He gave a broadcast speech at the Shanghai Radio Station at 9:15 PM on the 11th, titled "Telling the Compatriots of the Whole Country the Actual Situation of North China". The following is a summary of his speech.</p>
<p>Dear compatriots of the whole country, in order to understand the actual situation of China, I came to travel here from North China. Today, taking this broadcasting opportunity to talk with you, my dear compatriots, is truly enjoyable. The actual situation of North China in the five years since the Incident may also be something you are happy to hear about.</p>
<p>After the Lugou Bridge Incident, the entire North China fell into chaos. People were displaced, bandits rose up, and the countryside almost came to a standstill. As a result, cities such as Beijing and Tianjin also experienced the tragedy of food panic. Later, in the 29th year of the Republic of China, the North China Political Affairs Commission was established. Since the establishment of this organization, the political, security, financial, construction, and educational affairs of North China have developed rapidly. First, in terms of politics, each province organized a training center for county administration personnel. Incumbent county magistrates and the secretaries and section chiefs of various county governments were trained together. Without undergoing this training, one could not be appointed as a county magistrate. As a result of this selection, about 80-90% of incompetent and opportunistic county magistrates have been eliminated. Therefore, county administration has progressed rapidly. The Baojia system was completed long ago, and recently, the compilation of large townships has begun, which is expected to be completed this year. Once the large township system is compiled, each township will have a budget for income and expenditure. At that time, corrupt officials and inferior village chiefs will have no way to use their tricks. In North China, the counties that have already compiled the large townships in Hebei Province account for about 80%.</p>
<p>Speaking of the security situation in North China, the security strengthening campaign has been held since last year and ended on June 15th of this year, divided into four times. The fourth security strengthening campaign was promoted after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, so its movement was divided into three major goals. The first goal was to awaken the masses, so that the masses have the awareness of excluding Britain and the United States and building East Asia in their minds, called "East Asia Liberation". The second goal was "Suppressing Communists and Self-Defense" The third goal was "Diligence, Thrift, and Increased Production." During this period, self-defense groups in various parts of North China intensified training. The biggest gain during the fourth security strengthening period was the well-drilling work in diligence, thrift, and increased production. Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and Shanxi provinces held it simultaneously. The total number of wells drilled was 500,000, about 1,000 wells per county. For each well, the North China Political Affairs Commission provided an interest-free loan of 50 yuan and subsidized two tons of coal for brick burning. This well-drilling work has now been successful, and the drought problem in North China for thousands of years has been partially solved during these four security strengthening periods, as a result of the four security strengthening campaigns, the people's hearts are greatly at ease.</p>
<p>At the same time, the North China Political Affairs Commission Security General Office also started building the army, and those who were compiled were stationed in various parts of North China. Every soldier is a good family child with a constant property and a little knowledge. They are youths selected by the village chiefs from each county and village, and they must pass an exam before being allowed to enlist and receive training. The police power in North China is also affiliated to the Security General Office, which has a police affairs office, headed by Wang Zhulin, who actively strengthens police administration, such as the training of police officers and police officers in each county. The police chiefs must carefully select their talents and examine their qualifications. Each province also has a training institute for police chiefs, so the quality of police personnel in each county is gradually improving. For the compilation of Baojia, the training of self-defense groups, the control of the economy, and the distribution of supplies, they can all happily handle the current important policies.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about the actual economic situation in North China. Due to the success of the United Reserve Bank's issuance of silver notes, there were many difficulties when the United Reserve Bank's policy was promoted. However, because those in charge buried their heads in hard work, after the old legal currency disappeared in North China, the Political Affairs Commission forcibly controlled financial institutions, such as banning illegal silver houses and money shops, so the silver houses and money shops in North China automatically changed their business or gathered shares to apply for opening silver houses and banks according to law. In short, after such strict control, the floating capital of North China has been brought into line. Speculative business has long been completely eliminated. Recently, all businesses have been organized into a cooperative system, and all commodities have been completely implemented with a rationing system and a marked price system. If one illegally obtains exorbitant profits, one can be immediately subject to the investigation and sanctions of the economic police officers. Therefore, the price suppression is quite effective.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk briefly about the construction and education of North China. The construction of North China in the five years since the Incident is truly amazing. Specifically, first, the Shide Railway has been completed. This is the railway line from Shimen City (formerly known as Shijiazhuang) in the southern part of Hebei Province to Dezhou, an important place in Shandong Province. This line runs across the Beijing-Hankou and Tianjin-Pukou lines.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Shitai Line (also known as the Zhengtai Line) was converted into a wide gauge, so the rich resources of Shanxi can be directly transported to the Shide Line. Important products such as cotton, wheat, and peanuts from the southern part of Hebei can be easily transported. Passenger cars have also been opened early. For example, if we go to Shimen from Shanghai or Qingdao, or go to Taiyuan, we can change to the Shide Line from Dezhou on the Tianjin-Pukou Line without having to detour through Tianjin and Beijing.</p>
<p>Other construction works, such as the opening of the Fujiang River, the Yongding River, and the tributaries, and the new construction of the Shijin Canal (from Shitou to Tianjin), not only benefit transportation, but also prevent floods. Another example is the construction of new cities, the major reform of the Beijing East and West Railway Stations, and the active construction of small cities in Xuzhou, Taiyuan, Shitou, Handan, and Baoding, such as the opening of streets, the completion of sewers, and public bus transportation in various counties. All the important projects in North China that we can imagine are progressing steadily. Taking the Cangshi Railway and the Shijin Canal as examples, important people in our country had proposed to build and repair them 20 years ago, and they had been brewing several times, but they had not been realized. Now they have succeeded in the midst of military chaos. We can't help but feel emotional about this.</p>
<p>The education of North China has indeed progressed a lot compared to the time of the Incident. However, compared to before the Incident, both the quality and quantity are still inferior. In terms of quantity, it is limited by security and economic problems. In terms of quality, it is due to the lack of intellectuals. However, in the past year, as the security situation in various places has gradually turned around, the quantitative aspect has suddenly become more prosperous. At the time of the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, all the British and American missionary schools in North China were taken over by the state and have all resumed classes. In this hot summer, I wish all the compatriots in the country good health. Goodbye. (End)</p>

<p>Acknowledgement from this Newspaper</p>
<p>On July 30th, the Second Branch of the Shanghai Emergency and Epidemic Hospital sent personnel to inject epidemic prevention needles for the employees of this museum. However, some employees did not have time to inject at that time. Therefore, yesterday, we asked the hospital to send Mr. Xu Mian, Mr. Zhu Bingwen, Ms. Wang Shuzhen, and Ms. Wang Jingzhen to the museum for a second injection. All the employees of this museum have now been completely injected. The enthusiastic service spirit of the hospital is admirable. Thank you here.</p>

<h3>Not Lacking Selling at High Prices, Public Bond Gains Failed to Sharply Increase; Jin Chang Suddenly Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market conditions of unified public bonds continued the momentum of the previous day and rose again. However, due to selling at high prices from various parties, the gains failed to be very sharp. When the market opened in the morning, the market atmosphere was reported to be firm. Although there was no shortage of profit-taking in the market, the multiple parties continued to pull up the market. Type C bonds opened at 40 yuan, and after competing for buying and selling, they entered and exited around 40 yuan several times. Its highest was 0.02 yuan, and the lowest was squeezed to 9.08 yuan, which shows that the parties were very intense. The initial trading of other bonds also rose, but they fluctuated between 0.03 and 0.05 yuan in the middle. Observing the competition between multiple parties in the market, if Type C bonds can recover to 4 yuan and stand firm, the trend may continue to be firm. Other bonds will also follow suit. In the city, Tongshun, Runli, Hongda, Datong, Yutong, Tongyuan, Zhenhua, and Lianyi absorbed the most, and only Xinhua, Tonghe, Hengxing, Lianhe, Hu Heji, Yuanhe, and Tongji had more supply. The results of each bond varied from 0.02 yuan to 0.04 yuan. The transaction volume was about 2 million yuan. Jin Chang, which had not been opened for a long time, had a transaction yesterday. Its market price was first 32 yuan, and the highest was shouted to 33 yuan. The sale was calculated at 32 yuan, and tens of thousands of yuan were traded. It was sold by Hongxing and purchased by Xie Kangna. The list is as follows,</p>
<p>Type　High　Low　Close　Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>A　40.70　40.40　40.50　Up 0.20</p>
<p>B　40.00　39.50　39.60　Up 0.20</p>
<p>C　40.20　39.80　39.90　Up 0.30</p>
<p>D　38.70　36.40　36.60　Up 0.40</p>
<p>E　38.00　37.70　37.80　Up 0.40</p>
<p>Jin Chang　32　32.00　32.00</p>
<h3>Prosperous Trading in East China; Most Market Prices are Prosperous, Few Disgraced</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market conditions of Chinese stock shares continued to be firm and stable. The people of all parties were very confident. The Lemao Xinjih Yin Hao opened, and new buyers and investors came one after another. The market atmosphere became more and more prosperous, and the trading was smooth. As a result of the market price, the department store industry, China's underwear industry, took the lead in rising to a high price of 37 yuan, with a rise of 1.125 yuan being the largest. Yong'an and Xinxin, the two companies, returned to the same level after their initial rise. The cultural stock, Commercial Press, rose to 280 yuan, up 2.5 yuan. Zhonghua was flat, and Shijie also rose by 0.05 yuan. Yongxiang Printing convened a meeting of new and old shareholders and had good development. Buyers were more and more eager, and it continued to rise by 0.05 yuan. In the new pharmaceutical industry, Zhongfa was slightly up, and Xinya and Minyi were inferior. Dachina Match dropped by 2.5 yuan, Nanyang Tobacco Company fell slightly by 0.05 yuan, and Zhabei Water and Electricity stopped and retreated slightly. After Huashang Electric's 30 yuan barrier was broken, it returned again. Most of the other stocks also made progress as above. The market price list of each stock market is now recorded below.</p>
<h3>Decorative Gold Exchange Rate Raised by 50 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the selling price of jewelry gold coins per tael of the Dashin Tongxing Jewelry industry in this city was initially listed at 2,100 yuan. At around 10:30, it suddenly rose by 50 yuan and was suspended at 2,150 yuan (the purchase price was reduced by 350 yuan). At the same time, the retail price sold by the cash store was also raised from 2,050 yuan to 2,100 yuan. The purchase price was reduced from 300 yuan to 200 yuan, and the listed price was 1,900 yuan. It was also the rise in inter-industry price making under the concentrated buying power. The market opened 10 yuan higher in the morning, at (per tael) 1,830 yuan. Suddenly, in the situation of more demand than supply, a certain helping gang absorbed and stepped up 60 yuan, reaching a maximum transaction price of 1,890 yuan. The noon moment turned stable, and at noon, it was 1,880 yuan, which was 70 yuan higher than the previous day. The transaction was not deserted, with a high of 60 yuan.

<p>Competition Begins</p>
<p>Aiguo launched a fierce attack. Chen Zezhuang made a powerful move, but Lingsheng failed to defend in time. Before five minutes had passed, Wang Weizhen scored again. Lingsheng lost two goals in the first half. After changing sides, Lingsheng became even weaker. Aiguo's Ming Jing, Zhong, and Meihua scored twice. Seeing the situation was not good, Lingsheng quickly mobilized reinforcements. Indeed, Chen Ru'an recovered some lost ground. Aiguo's Zhu Chengran was suddenly called for a foul. Chen Ru'an scored on the six-meter penalty kick. With only one minute left in the game, Wang Weizhen scored again, leading to a 5 to 2 victory.</p>
<p>Youlian vs. Huanan - A Rematch on the Field</p>

Not long after the start of the game, Zhang Xianlun single-handedly stormed the enemy's gate. Huanan's Li Xianzheng carelessly failed to block him, and the first goal was scored. Huanan's Liu Chuji, unwilling to be outdone, cleverly used an "empty fort" strategy and immediately scored a goal back.

<h3>Autumn Offensive of Various Theatrical Circles</h3>
<p>— Bingjiu</p>
<p>"The Shanghai theatrical scene, which had been quiet during the summer, has now passed its period of dormancy. Stirred by this prolonged stillness, various troupes are making preparations for an autumn offensive. They are adjusting their lineups, recruiting new talent, engaging in mutual deception, and showcasing their skills. This is like the calm before a major battle, and the work done during this period is more important and complex than the battle itself. Although the preparations of various theatrical troupes are not yet in the final stage, most are already well underway. This information is being disseminated, but theatrical news can change rapidly, and the final decisions remain to be seen.</p>
<p>Golden</p>
<p>Golden's autumn lineup is mostly finalized. The core members, such as Furongcao, Xiao Sanmazi, and Gao Xueqiao, will remain. As for the supporting roles, they have hired Guo Suqiu, Li Shengzao, Yuan Shihai, Jiang Shiyu, and Ai Shiju. They are expected to arrive in Shanghai around the end of this month, with the opening date set for around September 10th.</p>
<p>Renewal</p>
<p>Song Dezhu's troupe was originally scheduled to perform for one month, but if the performances are well-received, the engagement may be extended for another month or two. The cast for the next period is still being sought, with Zheng Bingru or Liang Xiaoluan being the targets.</p>
<p>Tianchan</p>
<p>The owner of Tianchan is determined to innovate this autumn, sparing no expense to hire supporting actors to compete with Golden and Renewal. The recruiting staff has already gone to Beijing, and the leading actor is expected to be Jin Shaoshan or Li Wanchun. There are also rumors of inviting Mei Lanfang to perform, as Mei had a previous agreement with the owner of Tianchan a few years ago. (Some say Yu Sulian and Gao Baisui have been hired, but it is unclear which is correct.)</p>
<p>Gongwutai</p>
<p>They will continue to perform original plays, with no changes to the cast.</p>
<p>Great Stage</p>
<p>Last year, the Great Stage invited Tan Fuying to Shanghai, which proved to be profitable. This year, they plan to invite him again for a month-long engagement. However, the exchange rate between Beijing and Shanghai has increased significantly in recent years, so the issue of payment still needs to be negotiated.</p>
<p>Empress</p>
<p>The Empress is ambitiously switching to Peking Opera, with a grand vision. In addition to sending staff to Beijing to invite Shang Xiaoyun and Zhou Xiaotian, they have also hired Zhao Songqiao, Cheng Yupu, Liu Yunfang, Ge Cijiang, Zhang Yueting, and others, forming a strong and well-organized team. (Rumor has it that Cheng Shaoyu, Liu Binkun, and Wang Lanfang have been hired, but since Cheng and others are core members of Golden, this is unlikely to be true.)</p>
<p>Great Shanghai</p>
<p>Rumors of the Great Shanghai switching to Peking Opera are rampant. The hosts, Zhang Shankun and Feng Gengguang, are focusing on Mei Lanfang alone. If Mei is willing to perform, then restructuring into a Peking Opera theater will not be a problem. Otherwise, it may just be a pipe dream.</p>
<p>In addition, the Central Grand Theater, which has been showing domestic films, is also considering switching to Peking Opera and is currently in preparation. There are rumors of hiring Zhou Xinfang to perform, but the cast has not yet been determined. In short, this year, due to the film shortage, Peking Opera theaters have been given a chance to make a comeback. However, the cost of hiring leading actors is high, and other expenses are no longer what they used to be. Coupled with the sluggish market and the people's insecure livelihoods, although the theaters are racking their brains and competing fiercely, the results may not be as satisfactory as they hope.</p>
<h3>The Truth Behind Chen Yanyan and Huang Shaofen's Marital Crisis</h3>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>"The film industry has recently been buzzing with news of a marital crisis. Fans are very concerned about this case. I have uncovered the truth and am reporting it to the readers.</p>
<p>The main characters in this marital crisis are the famous actress Chen Yanyan, known as 'Little Crow,' and her husband, the cinematographer Huang Shaofen. Their union began with friendship and blossomed into love. They married in September of the 26th year of the Republic (1937). Due to their love, they lived a sweet life. Soon after, they celebrated the birth of their daughter, nicknamed 'Baobao,' who is now five years old. Unfortunately, the moon waxes and wanes, and beautiful flowers wither easily. Starting last year, the feelings between the two gradually cooled, and they seemed to be heading in the same direction as Zhou Xuan and Yan Hua. However, the issue of 'Baobao's' upbringing has stalled the matter. The agreed-upon solution is that Chen Yanyan will raise 'Baobao' until she is ten years old, and Huang Shaofen will educate her after she turns ten. This Baobao has been raised by Yanyan's mother since she was a child. She felt heartbroken at the thought of her beloved granddaughter being taken away by Huang Shaofen when she turned ten. Therefore, the divorce proposal was temporarily suspended, and they agreed to separate. After the news spread, many speculations arose, and people added fuel to the fire by pairing the couple with other potential partners. A very simple matter was amplified, creating a tense and complicated situation. The person paired with Chen Yanyan was a married man, and his wife was a close friend of Yanyan. Anyone who understands reason and law would know that these two could never be together, but this has stirred up many ruthless storms. Recently, after lawyer Yuan Yang'an was appointed as Chen Yanyan's legal advisor, as announced in this newspaper and other daily newspapers, it aroused further speculation. To understand the truth, I made many inquiries and learned that Chen Yanyan had indeed proposed a divorce from Huang Shaofen before. However, recent developments have become so bizarre and absurd that the matter has been temporarily suspended. She is now staying at home and avoiding contact with the outside world to avoid further rumors. As for the motive for hiring a legal advisor, it is because there are many rumors circulating, so she needs legal protection. Simply put, Chen Yanyan is living her summer life quietly, without any tension. The rumors are mostly due to the atmosphere.</p>
<h3>A Record of Summer Entertainment with Qingge</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>Ge Wensheng</p>
<p>"Mr. Ge is a famous amateur Peking Opera singer from Beijing. Ten years ago, he studied at the National Opera Training Institute founded by Mei Lanfang, Yu Shuyan, and others, specializing in the Yu school of laosheng (old male) roles. He excels in 'kao ba' (military) and 'zuo gong' (acting) plays. Among the amateur singers in Beijing today, he is the most diligent and progressive. His position is similar to that of Sun Junqing in Shanghai. He came to Shanghai on business and performed a full rendition of 'Qionglin Banquet' at the Golden Theater to raise funds for a charity organization. I went to watch it. From the opening scene of 'Wen Qiao' asking for directions to the closing, his movements, steps, hair flicks, and water sleeves were all precise. It was a pity that his voice was a bit low due to illness. Mr. Ge is quite tall. If he were to perform 'kao ba' plays, it would be even more spectacular. That day, even though Mr. Ge was in the audience, he could not refuse to sing due to his illness and weak voice. As a result, he sang two excerpts from 'The Basin Case,' 'Sighing at Life' and 'What a Good One,' purely in the Yu style, with many small tunes. Mr. Ge asked me about his singing technique. I said, 'You have captured eight or nine tenths of Yu's subtlety, which is commendable. However, given your large physique and ample lung capacity, you should further refine your vigorousness. Combine strength and softness to reach the highest level. Yu's use of softness is a last resort. Softness is the way of the earth, the virtue of water. If you combine it with the yang (male) energy of fire, it will be perfect.' Since Yu Shuyan, Jukui, Yunliang, and Chengdong, all performers and amateur singers under the age of forty have been emphasizing softness. I know this opinion is not in line with the times, but to correct the current trend, my advice should be adopted, not just for Mr. Ge alone. The word 'strength' is like getting a vaccination during a severe epidemic.'</p>
<p>After Mr. Ge sang, the other guests in the audience also sang one after another. There was one damao (female role), one xiaosheng (young male role), one qingyi (virtuous female role), and the rest were laosheng (old male roles), so I won't go into detail. Finally, the task fell on me. I originally didn't dare to sing the finale, but everyone repeatedly urged me to sing since I was the only one left. Mr. Chen and Mr. Ge were especially insistent, as they wanted to hear me sing just as much as I wanted to hear them. The host, Mr. Jiang Si, asked me to sing the four lines of 'Sighing at the Misfortune of My Brothers' from 'Sangyuan Jizi,' a slow-tempo erhuang. Lao Tan (Tan Xinpei) was a master of this, and Xiao Pei (Pei Yanling) was also very proud of these four lines. He would sing them whenever he met a friend at a banquet. Although I cannot surpass the heroic figures, I am content to be on par with Xiao Pei.</p>
<h3>Two New Films to Be Released Soon</h3>
<p>"Hate to Meet Before Marriage", starring Shu Mei-yun and Gao Zhanfei, is scheduled to be released on the 20th of this month at the Da Guangming Theater. This film is filled with twists and turns, and is expected to appeal to the tastes of most audiences, and is a masterpiece directed by Wang Yin in his life. It is now reported that "Under the Peony Flower", directed by Bu Wancang and starring Chen Yunshang, is also scheduled to be released on the 27th of this month at the Dahua Theater. These two films are excellent films specially selected by the Zhonglian Film Company, so they are scheduled to be shown at Western film theaters to show their importance.</p>
<h3>After Listening to Zhu Xiaoqiu's "Fa Men Temple"</h3>
<p>— Guo Yi</p>
<p>"Last Friday (the 7th), Zhu Xiaoqiu performed 'Fa Men Temple' as a charity performance at the Golden Theater. I went with Mr. Jin Shaogang to listen. Since Xiaoqiu returned to Shanghai from Hankou, I have met him several times and heard him practice his voice. His singing voice is round and mellow, and his singing style is accurate. I have always praised his talent and beauty. In this era when Peking Opera standards are declining, when the younger generation is competing to learn seductive and charming styles to cater to the times, it is rare to find someone so unyielding and purely following the correct path. It is like hearing the sound of an empty valley, which makes people happy. This is the first time I have seen him on stage with makeup, and his performance is even better than I expected. I must say a few words to help promote him, so that in the future, if Xiaoqiu has the opportunity to perform in Shanghai, the audience can have a general understanding of him based on my comments.</p>
<p>Xiaoqiu comes from a prominent family in southern Hunan. He is fond of Peking Opera and has played it as an amateur in Hankou, where he is very famous. At the same time, his peers rarely dare to challenge him. He then traveled to the old capital and sought advice from senior actors, refining and immersing himself in it day by day and month by month. As a result, his skills became more profound, and he decided to become a professional actor. The famous amateur singer from Hubei Province who became successful before Xiaoqiu was Nan Tiesheng. Now Xiaoqiu is following in his footsteps and is enough to compete with him. Xiaoqiu possesses everything that Tiesheng has, and Xiaoqiu has the unique advantage of a clear and bright voice, which Tiesheng cannot match. His solid rhythm and timing are even better than Tiesheng's. Comparing them in every aspect, Xiaoqiu is not just surpassing him. Taking the 'Fa Men Temple' this evening as an example, I felt that his singing style strictly adheres to the rules, like Huang Guiqiu. However, in terms of his high-pitched and vigorous parts, Guiqiu is less calm and composed. Xiaoqiu maintains a simple and unadorned style, while still retaining the demeanor of a qingyi. Xiaoqiu came to my residence the next day, courteous and humble, hoping that I would point out his shortcomings. This shows Xiaoqiu's willingness to learn from others and his sincerity in asking about what he doesn't know. However, how can I benefit Xiaoqiu? I only know that Xiaoqiu is humble and ambitious, and I believe that he is just starting his career and will not stop. Xiaoqiu's rise in the empty valley is like choosing the most talented person in difficult circumstances, and he is striving to improve himself. Encouraging him and setting expectations is what I hope for from those who share my values. Although I am not talented, I do not easily praise others unless they truly deserve it.</p>
<h3>A Tour of Shanghai's Book Market</h3>
<p>— Jianfan</p>
<p>"In recent years, Shanghai's book market has been booming again. Listening to storytelling is an affordable form of entertainment. Among all the recreational activities, it is the cheapest. Moreover, it is enjoyed by both the refined and the common. As long as you sit patiently and quietly, everyone can listen with great interest! Storytellers travel around, engaging in their art and delving into the lives of ordinary people. They have the responsibility of promoting popular culture and play a noble role in the entertainment industry. Their subtle influence should not be ignored. Recently, several new book markets have opened in the Shanghai concessions, bringing the total number to at least sixteen or seventeen, together with the existing ones. Famous storytellers are in high demand and are fully booked. I have a passion for listening to storytelling and have made a grand aspiration to visit various venues and record what I see and hear for fellow enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Huangfu Book Market</p>
<p>The Huangfu Book Market opened on August 1st. It is located in the alley next to the theater on Zhejiang Road in the central district, on the original site of the Huangfu Hotel's ballroom. It has been renovated to look brand new and luxurious! The curtains and table covers on the stage are all yellow, giving it a regal atmosphere. The newly made canvas chairs can accommodate about two hundred listeners. The equipment and layout are quite good.</p>
<p>The storytelling lineup at the Huangfu is very strong. The daytime, afternoon, and evening sessions all feature top performers! Especially the daytime sessions, which are full of talent and guaranteed to satisfy listeners.</p>

<h3>Sun Jinglu Signs Contract with "Lihua"</h3>
<p>— Weiren</p>
<p>Sun Jinglu has left the Green Treasure Theater in a friendly and amicable atmosphere! Everyone is paying close attention to her future plans. According to reporters, Sun Jinglu has signed a contract with the Lihua Grand Theater.</p>
<p>The Lihua Grand Theater's design is completely based on the latest Hollywood-style theaters. The stage, seating, lighting, and other aspects are unique in Shanghai. For example, in addition to the velvet curtain on the outside, there is also a thin gauze curtain. Above it are equipped with seven-color lanterns. When the curtain is about to open, the lights on all sides gradually dim, and the word "Quiet" appears in the middle. Then, the words "First Act" appear. This poetic and lively scene is sure to give the audience a refreshing stimulation.</p>
<p>Sun Jinglu has signed a contract with the theater, and all the conditions have been agreed upon. The performance period is scheduled for the Mid-Autumn Festival in the lunar calendar (around September 19th). This scorching month, she is putting all her efforts into rehearsing the play. Every actor is embracing the mission of promoting the theater movement and treating theater as important as their own lives.</p>
<p>The script and director are still being kept secret, but according to reporters, they will definitely not be careless.</p>
<p>Performing on an ideal stage with an ideal cast is good news for the Shanghai theater scene!</p>
<h3>Gao Tianlun's New Work</h3>
<p>The puppet troupe led by Mr. Gao Tianlun has been highly praised since its public performance in Shanghai. Now, more than 20 new-style puppets have been produced, specially for performing the famous fairy tale "The Adventures of Pinocchio". This film was a sensation in Shanghai, especially among children. Performing it with real puppets will be even more exciting. It is said that Mr. Gao is currently preparing day and night, and the play will be able to meet the people of Shanghai in about three weeks.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>The Xiaoguang Troupe was founded by the famous lawyer Chen Xingmin and others. Last year, they performed "Dijiujiao Niang" at the Lyceum Theatre, which was a success. They plan to perform "The Heart of a Woman" soon, which is bound to be a grand event.</p>
<h3>Sailing in the Same Boat Through Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jiaji</p>
<p>VIII. What to Do About It?</p>
<p>"The Ye family of Shidetang, from Madam Ye Er to Magpie and others, were all hoping for Weicheng's return, from morning to night. When he returned after dusk, Madam Ye Er greatly regretted not sending He Zixing to Shuangqiao Town after lunch. When he returned late at night, Madam Ye Er again regretted not sending He Zixing to Bianqiao Town when it was getting dark. But Cuizhen and He Ma kept comforting Madam Ye Er, saying that the snow had stopped, the wind had died down, and that with Axing accompanying him, it would be easy to carry the young master back on his back. Madam Ye Er took Weicheng's message and repeatedly read it under the lamp, saying, 'Weicheng said that I will know in a few days why he went to Yaoqiao. Why can I only know in a few days, and why can't I know now?' She muttered to herself, but didn't allow He Ma, Magpie, or others to whisper to each other. Her thought was that if Weicheng were to call at the door, their voices would disturb him, and she wouldn't be able to hear him. She listened to the chiming clock ring twelve times, and asked Magpie to help her go outside the gate to see if Weicheng was coming back. In the past, Madam Ye Er was more astute than Madam Ye Da among the wives of Shidetang. But tonight, because she was so worried about Weicheng's safety outside, her emotions suddenly overwhelmed her reason. Although Cuizhen explained, 'It's pitch black outside the gate, you can't see anything.' She said, 'The ground is covered with snow, how can you not see anything?' Cuizhen said, 'If he doesn't come back late at night, it must be that Master Chen and Miss Chen have kept him. It's pointless to go outside the gate.' She said, 'Even if Weicheng is kept by them, Axing can come back. Seeing Axing is like seeing my son come back.' Seeing that her persuasion was ineffective, Cuizhen immediately asked He Ma to light a lantern and send Madam Ye Er outside the gate. He Ma held the lantern in front, with Magpie on the left and Cuizhen on the right, holding Madam Ye Er as she walked outside. The farmhand Xu Quanfu opened the main gate and the bamboo gate and waited. Outside the gate was a sheet of white, and in the distance was a patch of black. There was no sign of Weicheng or Axing, not even a single passing stranger. A gust of wind almost blew out the candle inside the lantern. This forced Madam Ye Er to return disappointed." (152)</p>
