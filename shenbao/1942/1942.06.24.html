<p>對德宣戰</p>
<p>實屬錯誤、此與一九一八年間吾人未能以對德諒解、作爲建樹歐洲和平之基礎、先後如出一轍時至此際、吾人必須竭盡　切可能的方法、以達到與</p>
<p>德國協調之目的、並當不惜任何代價、務使吾人之後世不致每　二十五年或三十年、即發生次戰禍現行戰爭之結果、行　產生一新歐洲、德國爲建設新歐洲起）、現正從事人規模的戰爭、任何重大犧牲、均所不惜、原來從事農工業之全國靑年茲已一致參加鬥爭、在此種情形之下、余惟有希望德國戰勝</p>
<p>蓋非然者、鮑爾雪維主義即將蔓延全世界也、吾人於一此、僅有兩途可循、一即參加新的和平的歐洲、吾人之榮譽及生存攸關之利益、均將因此獲得他國之尊重、二即坐視我國文明之消滅、余知採取</p>
<p>對德合作</p>
<p>政策對於一般國人、不無困艱之處、良以國人過夫所受敎育，從不知有與德國成立協定之必要、但余因愛護祖國太甚之故、實不暇顧及一己之毀譽、蓋余必須履行政府首長之責任、余敢明吿諸君、</p>
<p>此一政策</p>
<p>乃法國自救之唯一的康莊大道、足以保證將來和平之發展諸君務當見信、並追隨本人之後、共同奮鬥、則個人幸甚、國家幸甚、抑在過去數星期中、余已迭次接見軍界領袖、各省省長、新聞記者、勞資代表、暨參戰軍人代表相與談話、余曾披肝瀝胆、坦白相吿、言無不盡、自余</p>
<p>就任首長</p>
<p>一職以來、雖僅爲時兩月、但余深知已爲國人所認議、諸君須知、政府茲已遭遇新的困難、英國之侵略我馬達加斯加島、美國之干涉我國西印度羣島、即其犖犖大者、當余出任政府首長之日、一般人莫不相信改善對德關係之後、必能使法國少受</p>

<p>德國當局</p>
<p>寬大爲懷、業已採取各種優待措置、例如准許俘虜請假、及與普通工人同樣待遇、給予工資、甚至准許將其家屬接往德國、以期團聚等等辦法、不一而足、是以余有種種理由、可信彼時希特勒元首原擬採取若干寬大措置、以對待我國俘虜、詎知事與願違　發生驚人事件、季祿將軍竟突然潛逃無踪、於是德國政將即通知我國、聲明所有給予俘虜之各種便利、均常取消、此其可憾、不言可喩矣査近年法國國內</p>
<p>原料匱乏、我國工廠幾陷於停頓狀態、失業工人因以日見增加、反之、德國對於人力、則方需要甚殷、在此種情形之下、我國俘邊似又發生一種新希望、余知吾國工人、對於會　　　、素確以仁俠之精神、加以　　、故余此次決計再向君等作</p>

<p>戰俘歸耕</p>
<p>、一俟君等到達　國、即可見　實行、君等倘能前往德國工作、以使大批戰俘得以歸返家國、重叙天倫之樂、若　妻子、必將感激諸君於無涯、前者我國戰士効命疆塲、以保衛國內勞工、時至今日、當有勞工報答戰士之時矣、法蘭西同胞乎、君等之前往德國、將爲釋放我國戰俘而往、亦即爲國家利益而往、不特此也法國且可在</p>

<p>恢復其應有地位、余　言此次戰爭、與以往不同、因此次乃革命戰爭、新歐洲必將脫穎而出、君等對於法國之新體制、無庸疑惑、蓋將來之法國、必爲一蓬勃强盛之共和國、社會主義亦必遍佈於歐洲、此在法國必將根據共本國特質、採行適合我國之政體、問胞乎、</p>
<p>貝當元首　乃偉大之戰士、畢生奉公守法盡瘁報國、現方領導我國、致力復興、余今夜特代其發言、元首亦將親自明吿君等曰、法國絕不容有歷史而無法國、仰賴元首之剛毅、深信我國必能否極泰來、</p>

<p>斑疹傷寒，近來　之色變，尤以西人為甚，然國醫於傷寒論，自古以來，最爲經心，而條理析辨，積久蔚爲大觀，鑒於普通人相驚伯有，敢貢常識。</p>
<p>斑疹傷寒，古名熱疫病，又名疫疹，俗呼疙瘩溫，初起，症象先惡寒，後發熱，頭痛腰痛，腹攪（即絞）嘔　，下身無汗，上身有汁，頭汗更多，顏面腫脹，潮紅，嗜眠囈語，重者一二日即昏迷，三五日後，遂發紅疹，甚且赤斑，脈搏與傷寒相反，（按傷寒脈遲綫與熱勢不符）乃與熱並增者，大便多秘，亦有下惡垢糞水者。</p>
<p>經歷情形，大概「初起寒戰發熱甚髙，脈數，體痛，頭痛，煩熱，夜間囈語，」三五日後發疹，熱稍退，繼復髙升，第二星期勢轉劇，，神昏譫狂，挖枕，摸床，手舞足蹈，咬牙抽　，舌紅苔黑兩便失禁，以至於死。」</p>
<p>性質——屬傷寒中最危險，進行轉變最速者。</p>
<p>起因爲營養不良，起居不淸潔，故此病多生於船舶囚獄，及人烟稠密處，而於天時亢旱時，凡素體抵抗力弱，（血少心臟弱）食偏肉類，少食蔬菜者，最易患之。</p>
<p>病毒中處——初在血脈心臟，後入腦中。</p>
<p>洽法——一起即須治之，因危急者不俟第二星期，轉瞬即毒人腦中，中醫謂邪入心胞，其主方爲余師愚余師愚淸初人，皖籍，與紀文達公同時。淸瘟敗毒飲，主藥如下：生石膏鮮生地角，犀·川運·梔子·桔梗·黃苓·知母赤　元參運喬甘草·丹皮·鮮竹葉·而大靑葉板藍根皆可加入，毒入腦用羚羊龍齒膽草，濂珠粉，初起症輕汗少，脈浮大而數者，用桔梗湯，方如下：桔梗。梔子·連喬·黃苓·甘草·薄荷。生石膏。</p>
<p>兩方見王孟英溫熱經緯，酌加木通，通草·赤小豆·海金沙·澤蘭·紫草·以排泄血分邪毒。</p>
<p>勿用硝黃攻大便，勿服表汗藥，舌乾裂津缺口大渴者，可服鮮而潔凈之甜橘汁，及石斛湯，以顧全病人之津液。相當期間，則用人參仙鶴草，靈效尤著。倘病毒入腦已深，及本元耗竭者，多不能治愈。</p>
<p>病家應注意考察者：查病人身上有無蚤虱，曾否接近貧人及汚穢人家，病人身上無紅疹紅斑。</p>
<p>禁忌方藥，桂枝，麻黃，弋黃，，芒硝，附子，肉桂，及多量之豆豉，豆卷，蘇葉，浮萍，及一切除石膏外，表散攻裏諸劑。再開數藥如麝香，蘇合香等，亦須忌服。（華星若）</p>

<h3 id="c64">評黃桂秋的齣戲 <a href="#c64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— 雁卿</p>
<p>我曾看聶黃桂秋　鎖記，祭長江，玉堂春，宇宙鋒，叫齣裏面，最滿意的是金鎖記，其次祭長江，冉次玉堂春宇宙鋒。</p>
<p>金鎖記是靑衣正工戲，梅蘭芳常　六月雪，只有稈硯秋和黃桂秋貼的是金鎖記。討好的地方，完全在坐監時的慢板和法塲上大段反調。但是最難唱也在這兩處地力，假如唱得不好，聽的人就索　乏味，毫無價値可言了。劇情雖涉於迷信，然而頗能警戒愚，終不失為</p>
<p>一齣好戲</p>
<p>黃桂秋去竇娥，扮　端莊，神態穩重，再適合也沒有，和程硯秋正是天生一對竇娥，程硯秋唱這齣戲，法塲上一段比坐監一段好，黃桂秋剛好相反，坐監一段勝於法塲一段。兩下扯平，剛好一樣，誰也分不出髙低來。向禁大娘懇悄和臨刑時之白口，柔聲下氣，凄切悲咽，一種嬌羞情恨的情緒，眞個要叫人心膽俱碎，不忍卒聽。所以在四齣戲中，金鎖記當排第一。第二應該是祭江，這駒戲是接看連運寨的，取材於</p>
<p>三國演義</p>
<p>大大略謂「東吳遺呂蒙襲取荊州，關公麥城歸大，張飛急爲報兄仇，致被范疆張達所害，蜀主劉備，興兵報仇，連敗東吳，後被陸遜用火攻之計，燒連營七百餘里，當時誤傳劉備歿軍中，孫夫人聞之，親至江邊設奠遙祭，因念先主，遂投江而死」。祭江一事，正史上並無紀載，皮簧劇大都根據稗官野史，往往妄加臆斷，不管事之有無，固不止祭江一劇也。那天夫劉備者爲紀玉良，去關羽者爲小三麻子，小三麻子是江南挺有名氣的紅生，除了唱工不逮林樹森外，其餘都較勝一籌。現在他是黃金的基本演員。黃桂秋是</p>
<p>德霖嫡派</p>
<p>所以祭江一劇，依然老派作風。唱做念白，都有點像德霖，嗓音很婉轉，髙音低音，全都使得來，總而言之，祭江是一齣賣唱戲，工力梢遜者，往往不敢動他。桂秋對於這一類老戲，却都有獨到之處，所以四齣戲中可以排第二。第三齣是玉堂春，我已經大略寫過了，姑且從略。最後一齣戲是宇宙鋒，這齣戲最難的地方，不在「我這裏假意見一段反二簧，却在唱這段反二簧時的神情，這種欲言欲止的神態，不但要和唱詞相合，而且要和啞奴的動作相合，委</p>
<p>很難表現</p>
<p>出來，黃桂秋天資聰敏，所以在這種地方，討着不少便宜。金殿裝瘋一塲，一貞」「烈嬌、羞、個字，都能做到，駡秦二世的白口，剛柔都有，就是欠淸晰。這齣戲好雖好，却不及以上三齣：所以只好屈居第四。</p>
<h3 id="c65">劇本與觀眾 <a href="#c65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>

<p>費穆自從導演孔夫子梅花夢等劇以來，深得觀衆們的仰慕，都說他是目前銀幕與舞台數一數二的導演。他平時很謙虛，有許多轎傲虛榮自以爲很髙明的演員，看見他是要慚愧的。本來，謙受益滿招損，虛榮驕傲的人終歸失敗，謙虛的人才會成功。</p>
<p>費穆不說對於戲劇有所研究，祗說是懷著很大的與趣。他說最近正愁着的是劇本的問題。「然有幾個很好的劇本，可惜因爲服裝等的緣故，却不宜於夏季公演。戲劇是演員在舞台上表演給觀眾看的一段一悄節，選劇本時，除了須顧到演員的能力與舞台的條件是不是合格以外，還須顧到觀衆是不是能够接受的問題。沒有觀衆的戲是不可想像的。我們很想搬演有名的中外大戲，祇是萬沒有人要看呢！往往觀衆所要的不是一部整個的戲，而是戲的故事，祇要故事動人，倒不在乎戲本身的好壞。所以我想先找一些適當的劇本來演，等到抓住了觀衆的時候，我們可以漸漸地改變觀衆的興趣，提高他們看戲的標準。」</p>

<p>對於周貽白君的電影劇本，我們已是最熟悉不過的了；可是周君的舞台劇本，自「李香君」後，却很不輕易可以看到，直到如今，才有「花花世界」新作，由唐若靑主演，與我人相見。</p>
<p>我們覺到周貽白的劇本，最可取的，便是緊緊抓住社會的現實，像新姐妹花」「歡樂年年」等，都予我們以親切實在的感覺。「花花世界」也是如此，它以描寫都會中職業少女生活變態為主題，很透澈地寫一個女學生，欲謀自身獨立，以虛榮的引誘，終於爲資本家蹂躪，而又墮落為舞女。像這樣的故事，是太現實而也太多了。周君把全劇四幕的過程，刻劃得十分淸楚：尤其是把各色人物的個性，有恰到好處的描寫着。</p>
<p>唐若靑以前很少演時裝戲，自「水仙花」獲得卓越成就後，接連便主演這一新作。她又是以豪華的作風，出現於此劇中。她投入資本家邵華的懷抱中，却不能沒有精神上的安慰，終於又誤奔到一個虛有其表的靑年趙恕那裏，於是展開了一幕絕大的悲劇。從喜劇轉到悲劇，唐若靑邵華趙恕這三主角，都有很可寳貴的演出。至於燈光置景，也都在水平綫之上的。</p>

<p>維城朝著他叔母十笑道：「過去，我們家境要比現在好，欠的債也沒有現在多。現在是不可同日而語了。」葉太太道：「不能這樣說，我們家境好不好，要從兩處看：一處就是看田裏的骰子，收的棉花，收的黃豆，如果收多了，就是好；一處要看你，你讀了書，畢了業，做了事，如果你有事，就是好。這麽說起來，家境便不會比以前壞。維城，我的擔子，一天比以前重一天，生怕把家境弄壞了，一則對不起你的母親，再則對不起世德堂，所以沒日沒夜的在想着，那裏能把我這副擔子，分給一個人，不要讓我一個人挑，最好是能讓兩個人來抬。」維城看了叔母的神情，又聽她說的話，有什麽懂不得，但是還追問了一句道：「嬸娘，想把擔子的重量分給誰？」（一一〇）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japanese Submarine Shells US Coast; American and Canadian Public and Officials Feel Uneasy; US Announces Coastal Convoy System Implementation <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Domei News Agency dispatch) – Reliable sources confirmed today that after a Japanese submarine shelled military facilities on Vancouver Island, another Japanese submarine appeared off the coast of Oregon in the United States, shelling US military installations. The location was near Fort Brown and Weissport, both located at the mouth of the Columbia River. The incident occurred between midnight on June 21st and the morning of the 22nd, with the submarine firing heavy artillery twice. According to news from Tokyo, the entire US West Coast is shaken by this. Both Canada and the United States have been subjected to submarine attacks, further proving Japan's control of the Pacific.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Domei News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese submarine's sudden shelling of Vancouver Island, Canada, on the afternoon of the 20th has caused great panic in Britain and America. From the night of the 21st to the morning of the 22nd, a Japanese submarine appeared again in the ocean near Brown Port and Westport at the mouth of the Columbia River in Oregon, North America, shelling important US military facilities there twice, causing great panic in the United States. The location of the Japanese submarine shelling is at the mouth of the Columbia River north of San Francisco, very close to Vancouver Island, which was shelled the day before. Large cities such as Portland and Olympia are located upstream of the river. Due to the continuous shelling of the US mainland by Japanese submarines, the confusion within the British and American camp has reached an extreme point.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 22nd (Domei News Agency dispatch) – Following the Japanese submarine shelling of Vancouver on the 20th, the northern coast of Oregon in the United States was again shelled by Japanese submarines from the night of the 21st to the morning of the 22nd. The Axis powers' unhesitating offensive operations are receiving great attention and astonishment from the world. Japanese submarines have bypassed United Nations surveillance and are carrying out elusive actions in the waters off the northwest coast of the American continent, proving how fragile the US and Canadian patrols are. After the Aleutian Islands operation, submarine warfare has become more active. According to general observations, until the Alaska Highway currently under construction is completed, there is no other way to transport supplies to Alaska other than by sea. The Japanese side has seen through this point, so they have taken special measures to hinder the US and Canada from increasing their land, sea, and air operations in that area.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Domei News Agency dispatch) – According to a Washington dispatch, the US West Coast Army Defense Command recently announced that a Japanese submarine shelled military facilities on the northern coast of Oregon twice, at 11:30 PM on the 21st and 2:30 AM on the 22nd. The first attack lasted for 15 minutes. Another message stated that according to a resident nearby, between ten and sixteen shells flew overhead at the time. This shelling of the US Pacific coast by a Japanese submarine is the third time. The first time was on February 23rd of this year, when Roosevelt was broadcasting a fireside chat, and the Japanese submarine shelled oil fields near Santa Barbara, California. The second time was two days ago (the 20th), shelling Vancouver. The second and third shellings serve as a warning to the Roosevelt-Churchill defeat conference currently being held in Washington.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Domei News Agency dispatch) – The attack by a submarine on Vancouver Island off the Canadian Pacific coast on the 20th was announced on the 21st by the Canadian Minister of National Defence, acknowledging the astonishing actions of the Japanese submarine, which has clearly caused panic among the American and British authorities. Today, the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun editorial commented on the matter, saying that the previous daring attack by a German submarine entering the St. Lawrence River on the east coast of Canada had shocked the entire country. This time, the sudden attack by a Japanese submarine on the west coast has caused a significant shock to the Canadian government and people. It also stated that Japanese submarines were active off the west coast of the US mainland at the end of last year, and on February 24th, they fiercely attacked military facilities in Santa Barbara, California, after which they continued to expand their gains in the Pacific. The US authorities were even afraid of Japanese air raids and focused on defense work. Since the defeat in the Aleutian Islands, the feeling of danger has become even more profound, and before the aftermath of this matter has been resolved, the sharp edge of the Japanese military has suddenly penetrated the west coast of Canada. This has not only shattered their dreams of a counter-offensive operation but will also cause them great concern about the defense of their homeland.</p>

<p>Domei News Agency, This Station – Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama, a spokesman for the Japanese Army, stated at the regular press briefing yesterday afternoon that the shortage of shipping tonnage is one of the main reasons why the Allies have failed to open a second front. When asked whether Roosevelt and Churchill would adopt public opinion to open a second front, especially after the fall of Tobruk, Mr. Yokoyama expressed his opinion in the capacity of a military officer, pointing out that the British army has never succeeded in any of its landing attempts when encountering resistance from the Axis forces. He also stated that the European coastline is heavily defended, and the Axis forces have prevented every British landing attempt. If the British army attempts to land in Spain or Portugal, it would be a violation of neutrality, and this attempt would only push the two countries towards the Axis. The situation in Northwest Africa may change, but this type of place mainly represents the expansion of the European front. Even if it is assumed that a portion of the British army successfully lands, a very large amount of shipping tonnage is required to maintain the supply route for the landing site, and this route will be constantly attacked by the Axis sea and air forces. Assuming the landing attempt is successful, the Axis forces are willing to carry out a war of attrition to deplete the Allies' ships. As for the situation in Africa, strategically, if the transportation and reinforcement routes are not taken into account, it is almost impossible to open a second front, and the British army is currently facing a great danger in Africa. Mr. Yokoyama said that the final question of opening a second front is also a matter of morale. Psychologically, if an army has never succeeded in a landing attempt and has suffered defeats, it is difficult to imagine that it would take brave action. Although the Soviet Union is urgently demanding the opening of a second front, the British army will obviously have to do something. It is expected that the British army will carry out air raids or make a sudden landing in Europe or Africa to fulfill its responsibility.</p>

<p>Disagreement Between the Two on Opening a Second Front</p>
<p>Madrid, 23rd (Haitong News Agency dispatch) – The newspapers in Spain last night published prominently news from Washington stating that Churchill and Roosevelt have very different opinions on the issue of the second front. Rumors are especially rife in Washington military and diplomatic circles, saying that Roosevelt has asked Churchill to open a second front immediately, but Churchill insists that an offensive should only be launched on the European continent after the Allies have a firm grasp on success. Churchill believes that solving the problem of ship tonnage and defending Egypt are more important than opening a second front. Washington sources believe that Churchill is deeply afraid that launching an offensive on the European continent will encounter a second Dunkirk fate. Roosevelt believes that it is unwise for the United States to station a large army in Britain and do nothing. Washington political figures commented on the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting, saying that after British and American generals have held meetings in Washington and London, Churchill and Roosevelt need to exchange opinions in person.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Haitong News Agency dispatch) – The New York Times published a dispatch from its Washington correspondent stating that the American newspapers initially viewed the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting as a symbol of the imminent opening of a "second front." However, after the news of the fall of Tobruk and the failure of the Soviet army in Sevastopol reached the United States, the optimistic mood of officials disappeared. The correspondent continued that Washington is now focusing on the defense of Egypt, and the discussion of opening a second front is no longer being emphasized.</p>

<p>New York, 23rd (Havas News Agency dispatch) – Soviet Ambassador to the United States Litvinov recently delivered a speech at the wartime relief association, stating that it is a pity that the second front was not opened when the Red Army took the initiative. If this move had been realized in time, the German army would have suffered a fatal blow, or at least would have suffered great losses. The armaments that the United Kingdom and the United States supplied to us, no matter how valuable, are proportionally insufficient to meet our wartime needs. But there is now reason to believe that the situation will soon change, and Germany will have to abandon its specialty of concentrating all its forces on one front.</p>

<h3 id="e17">Axis Military Advances Towards Egyptian Border, North and South Routes Encircle Solum, Fierce Fighting Near Capuzzo, General Rommel Promoted to Field Marshal <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Rome, 21st, Havas Agency Telegram: Today, the Italian Armed Forces Headquarters announced in a statement that the vanguard of the Axis forces has reached the Libyan-Egyptian border.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd, Domei News Agency Telegram: According to a special telegram from Rome on the 21st, published in the Tokyo "Nichinichi Shimbun," the main force of the Axis mechanized corps, after capturing Tobruk, El Adem, and Bardia, is pursuing the retreating Allied forces. The vanguard has broken through the Egyptian border, encircling Solum from the north and south. The Axis air force is also providing air support, heavily bombing Allied mechanized units, and conducting air raids on Allied rear bases such as Sollum, Marsa Matruh, destroying ground military facilities, warehouses, hangars, etc. They are also using machine guns to strafe Allied tank and truck convoys retreating into the desert. The Axis forces now control the airspace over this area. The British forces, under heavy land and air attacks from the Axis, have suffered severe damage. This battle can be described as the "Dunkirk" of the Sahara Desert. The railway and highway connecting Alexandria to Marsa Matruh have been bombed in more than ten places and are unusable.</p>
<p>Near the Libyan Border, 22nd, Havas Agency Telegram: After the successive losses of Tobruk, El Adem, and Bardia, the British forces have no foothold left in Libya. They now face a major task: how to continue resisting along the Libyan-Egyptian border in order to protect the Nile Valley, the Suez Canal, and all of Egypt. It is reported that the British Middle East Command has ordered its troops to hold firmly to the new defensive positions established along the border. At the same time, according to the latest news, a large quantity of military equipment appears to have fallen into the hands of the German-Italian forces in the port of Tobruk, as an important convoy recently sailed from Alexandria, where it unloaded fresh troops to assist the defenders. The British side acknowledges that at least 25,000 soldiers have been captured, including British, South African, and Indian units. British military experts believe that this setback is mainly due to the excessive losses of British armored units in the past week and the insufficient number of troops. The port of Tobruk is an important supply center for desert warfare, occupied by the British forces since January 22, 1941. It was surrounded by the Axis forces on April 12 of the same year, until December 10, when the Axis forces voluntarily lifted the siege. Only a few days ago, the port was once again heavily besieged, and finally, German armored units occupied it with a single blow. This is the success of the blitzkrieg offensive by General Rommel, commander of the German forces in North Africa. For the British, it represents a major blow, as they have lost a large number of troops well-trained in desert warfare. It is widely believed that Rommel will now fully utilize this new offensive base to concentrate his forces for a large-scale attack on Egypt. Fighting is reported to have broken out northwest of Fort Capuzzo, and the Axis forces appear to be launching a central breakthrough offensive against the British defensive line to test their resistance. It is now believed that Rommel will launch a swift attack as soon as his troops are reorganized and his lines of communication are consolidated, without waiting for British reinforcements to arrive. It is expected that after the German forces occupy a superior position, the Allies will have to transport military equipment via Cape Town in South Africa and the Red Sea, or even have to divert military equipment originally intended for Europe to reinforce the main defenses of Egypt.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd, Havas Agency Telegram: According to an official announcement here, General Rommel, commander of the Axis forces in North Africa, has been promoted to Field Marshal. Führer Hitler sent a telegram of congratulations, stating, "Your Excellency's command of troops in the North African campaign has been skillful and meritorious. In order to reward the brave fighting of your command, I hereby promote Your Excellency to Field Marshal, effective today."</p>
<p>Rommel's Brief Biography</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd, Havas Agency Telegram: Germany currently has over ten generals. Rommel, the newly promoted general, is named Erwin, is 52 years old, and is the youngest among the German generals. He is also the most admired general in the eyes of the German people today. Rommel first distinguished himself in the 1917 campaign against Italy. At that time, the Italian forces were defending Mount Matajur, which is 1,643 meters high. Rommel led the mountain troops in a fierce advance and achieved a remarkable feat within half an hour of the initial attack. Five regiments of Italian infantry, 150 officers, and 9,000 soldiers surrendered. In May 1940, Rommel achieved another remarkable feat. The troops under his command broke through the Maginot Line and advanced at an astonishing pace. Two enemy divisions, seeing the German troops descend from the sky like flying generals, were terrified and quickly defeated. At that time, Führer Hitler awarded him the Iron Cross, while the enemy called his troops the "Ghost Division" because of their ability to appear and disappear mysteriously. Last spring, Rommel was the commander of the German forces fighting in Africa. Before long, he drove the British forces out of Libya. The German Führer awarded him the Oak Leaves to the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, and the Italian army presented him with a silver medal to show their admiration. Last July, he was promoted to Lieutenant General. Last winter, Rommel led his troops and drove the British forces out of Cyrenaica, and was promoted to General. The German Führer awarded him the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords, and the Italian government awarded him the Savoy Cross. By then, Rommel's name was known throughout the world. Recently, Rommel conquered Tobruk, for which he was promoted to General, a truly great honor. Rommel is not only brave and good at fighting, but also has a deep understanding of military theory. From 1928 to 1939, Rommel served as an instructor and held other positions at military schools. His book "Infantry Attacks" has long been praised by practitioners. There are very few German officers who are praised in writing like Rommel, making him a remarkable figure.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Details of the Fall of Tobruk <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Rome, 23rd, Havas Agency Telegram: The "Messaggero" yesterday published a report on the structure of the Tobruk fortress and the entry of Axis forces into the city, stating that Tobruk had three strong defensive lines on the outer perimeter, at distances of 9 kilometers, 7 kilometers, and 2 kilometers from the center of Tobruk. Each defensive line had strong fortifications, and the areas inside and outside the defensive lines were heavily mined, making it impossible for the enemy to approach. The Axis forces began attacking Tobruk on the morning of June 20, guided by aircraft, followed by tanks and assault troops, with specialized engineers removing all obstacles. While German and Italian aircraft covered the ground forces operating along the entire line, they did not encounter a single enemy aircraft. The enemy forces were quickly defeated, and by noon, the Axis forces had broken through the second defensive line and were clearing out the remaining enemy forces between the second and third defensive lines. By 5:30 PM, the Axis vanguard had reached the port of Tobruk, and by then, the fall of the fortress was only a matter of time. The British forces, led by tanks, attempted to break through the Axis encirclement but were forced to retreat by heavy bombing from the German air force.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd, Havas Agency Telegram: According to military correspondent Koch, who accompanied the German-Italian forces to observe the North African campaign, when the attack on Tobruk began on the morning of June 20, he did not expect that the city could be occupied that evening. General Rommel's strategy was to occupy new positions at night and attack Tobruk from the new positions in the morning. Fifty German and Italian dive bombers first bombed the enemy's front-line fortifications. Artillery concentrated its bombardment on a 5-kilometer-wide area to prepare for the infantry attack. Engineers removed mines and cut barbed wire. Tanks immediately moved out, and engineers erected bridges over the anti-tank ditches. Infantry advanced with the tanks, and by 9:00 AM, they had stormed into the enemy's fortifications. Although the enemy fiercely shelled the gaps in the defensive line, they were unable to stop the Axis forces from penetrating. Artillery moved forward at any time, bombarding military targets. Enemy tank attacks were repelled. The number of enemy soldiers surrendering increased. Vehicles that were hit caught fire and burned. General Rommel directed the battle from an armored vehicle, and by 11:30 AM, he had penetrated 12 kilometers into the fortification line. After the German-Italian forces reached the coast, the British forces launched another tank attack, but were also repelled. The German forces occupied the high ground south of Tobruk in the evening. Artillery bombarded ships in the harbor, and fuel depots and other military targets were also destroyed. The remaining British forces surrendered, and Tobruk fell into the hands of the Axis forces.</p>
<h3 id="e19">British Acknowledge Serious Situation, Deputy Prime Minister to Report to House of Commons on North African War Situation <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 23rd, Havas Agency Telegram: A commentator for the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) stated that the fall of Tobruk has created an extremely serious situation for the British forces in North Africa. This crushing defeat is comparable to the disasters of Dunkirk, Greece, Crete, Malaya, and Burma. The main reason for the defeat of the British Eighth Army is the lack of tonnage. Therefore, the British people are now beginning to recognize that the tonnage problem is the most important issue.</p>
<p>London, 22nd, Havas Agency Telegram: It has just been learned that Deputy Prime Minister Major Attlee will deliver a speech in the House of Commons, reporting on the Libyan war situation and the fall of Tobruk. At that time, Members of Parliament will also be able to ask questions, but the House of Commons will not hold a debate before Prime Minister Churchill returns from Washington. Members of both the House of Commons and the House of Lords believe that the fall of Tobruk constitutes a serious blow. There are various indications that after this new setback, the authorities will no longer be tolerated by the two Houses if they continue to make optimistic speeches. However, there will be no changes among the Cabinet members.</p>
<p>American Newspapers Consider Defending Egypt Important</p>
<p>Washington, 22nd, Havas Agency Telegram: The fall of Tobruk in North Africa has been widely commented on by newspapers here, all of which say that the Allies have suffered another major setback. The impact of this event on the defense of Egypt and the opening of a second front is even more significant than the event itself. For example, the New York Times stated, "The fall of Tobruk, along with the crisis in Sevastopol, has greatly disappointed those who were overly optimistic about Prime Minister Churchill's discussions with President Roosevelt about opening a second front. What we should pay attention to now is the defense of Egypt, not the opening of a new front, because Egypt is very important for protecting the Allied position in the Middle East. In short, the fall of Tobruk will inevitably affect the decisions that Roosevelt and Churchill should take." The New York Post also stated, "The British forces have suffered another setback, which will inevitably have serious consequences for British politics and military strategy. This event makes American public opinion believe that the current military situation is still very unfavorable."</p>
<p>Australia Greatly Shaken, Turkey Deeply Impressed</p>
<p>Sydney, 22nd, Havas Agency Telegram: The news of the fall of the British fortress of Tobruk in Libya has shocked the entire nation of Australia. Public opinion is demanding a thorough investigation of responsibility for the defeat. The Sydney Sun stated, "British critics should be responsible for investigating whether this setback was due to insufficient equipment, strategic errors, or poor command from headquarters. It is feared that German General Rommel will not be satisfied with this victory. Therefore, the only way to improve the situation is to improve strategy and strengthen resistance, so as to recover part of the prestige lost by the Imperial troops in the past three weeks."</p>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd, Domei News Agency Telegram: Australian Army Minister Ford recently criticized the consequences of the fall of Tobruk, expressing deep concern that the Suez Canal would fall into the hands of the Axis powers and that the British would lose their control of the Mediterranean. Ford said briefly that the failure to defend Tobruk should not be underestimated, as it is a major blow to Allied objectives. Tobruk is one end of a pincer attack, and the other end is Sevastopol, which is currently under threat. If the two ends merge, the Allies will be driven out of the Mediterranean, and the Suez Canal will be lost.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 22nd, Havas Agency Telegram: Turkish officials have been deeply impressed by the fall of Tobruk and the victory of the Axis forces in Libya. At the same time, they are critical of the strategy of the British headquarters. Pro-German Member of Parliament Sadat said in an article published in the "Akşam" newspaper, "The British government prides itself on having control of the Mediterranean and Egypt, but we must admit that the German-Italian forces have reached the Egyptian border, which is not good for the Allies. The British side often regards the Libyan front as the most important line. The German forces have now invaded Egypt to prevent the Allies from opening a new front in Europe. We must admit that the German plan has been very successful. The current task for the British is to relieve the danger to Egypt and the Suez, so opening a second front is for Germany, not for Britain."</p>

<p>Near the Soviet Border, 22nd, Havas Agency Telegram: After the German-Romanian forces broke through the last line of defense of the port of Sevastopol, street fighting is reported to have broken out outside the port. The German-Romanian forces have occupied a large area on the north bank of the port, and the Red Army is slowly retreating. German artillery in the north is now heavily shelling the Red Army positions in the south. The downtown area of the port has been reduced to rubble, and bloody fighting is about to break out in the city center. It is now believed that the Red Army has decided to sacrifice part of its troops in street fighting in order to allow the main force of the defenders to calmly board ships and evacuate, but evacuation is also very difficult under German air bombardment.</p>
<p>Bern, 23rd, Havas Agency Telegram: According to the Moscow correspondent of the British Exchange Telegraph Company, organized resistance in Sevastopol has been eliminated. According to last night's report, the Soviet forces in Sevastopol have been cut off into several parts and can no longer offer organized resistance. Since the German forces occupied the north bank of Sevastopol Bay, the port of Sevastopol has lost its value to the Soviet forces. The fortifications south of the Sevastopol fortress were completely destroyed yesterday, and the interior of the fortifications was pulverized by 2,000 kg bombs.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd, Havas Agency Telegram: According to the German High Command, German forces began an offensive northeast of Kharkov on the 20th of this month and have made considerable progress. Three Soviet tanks were destroyed, and an enemy reconnaissance team that crossed the Donets River at night was also repelled. German fighter planes shot down eight Soviet planes in an air battle east of Kharkov.</p>
<p>Romanian Losses</p>
<p>Bucharest, Romania, 22nd, Havas Agency Telegram: It has just been officially announced that Romanian forces have been fighting the Soviet Union for a year. In this year, a total of 5,918 senior and middle-ranking officers, 2,633 junior officers, and 148,941 soldiers have been lost. This number includes those killed in action, wounded, and missing. Among them, the wounded account for approximately 70% of the total losses, and most of them have returned to their units after recovering from their injuries.</p>
<p>Finnish Achievements</p>
<p>Helsinki, Finland, 22nd, Havas Agency Telegram: Today is the anniversary of the start of the German-Soviet war. The Finnish government has issued a statement detailing Finland's achievements since entering the war, stating that since Finland entered the war on June 25, 1941, it has shot down as many as 872 Soviet aircraft. No fewer than 2,308 aircraft have been damaged, and 33 have been captured. Finland has lost only 56 aircraft. Political figures here have also made statements, reiterating that Finland's participation in the war was entirely because it was attacked first. It can be seen that Finland's war aim is to protect its national independence and to obtain easily defensible borders, and this wish has actually been achieved. According to the "Kuvalehti" newspaper, Finland's natural borders, the Karelian Isthmus, the Isthmus of Onega, and the Isthmus of the White Sea, if new defensive fortifications are added, can be as solid as gold. Strategically speaking, Finland's borders are as follows: in the southeast, starting from Lake Ladoga, following the Svir River to Lake Onega, then via the Stalin Canal, Lake Vygozero, and the Vygozero River to the White Sea.</p>

<h3 id="e23">Laval's Radio Address Emphasizes Cooperation with Germany and Italy, Urges Workers to Go to Germany to Serve <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Vichy, 22nd (Havas Agency) - Chief Laval delivered a radio address this morning, strongly advocating that France should restore normal relations with Germany and Italy. The full text of his address is translated as follows: "Fellow countrymen, we must clearly understand the current situation. In 1939, our</p>
<p>Declaration of War on Germany</p>
<p>was a mistake. This is similar to our failure in 1918 to establish European peace on the basis of understanding with Germany. Now, we must do everything possible to achieve</p>
<p>Coordination with Germany, and we must spare no cost to ensure that our future generations do not suffer another war every 25 or 30 years. The result of the current war will produce a new Europe. Germany, as the builder of a new Europe, is now engaged in a large-scale war, sparing no major sacrifice. The young people of the whole country, originally engaged in agriculture and industry, have now unanimously joined the struggle. In this situation, I can only hope for a German victory,</p>
<p>Because otherwise, Bolshevism will spread throughout the world. We only have two paths to follow: one is to participate in a new, peaceful Europe, where our honor and vital interests will be respected by other countries; the other is to sit idly by and watch the destruction of our civilization. I know that adopting a</p>
<p>Policy of Cooperation with Germany</p>
<p>is not without difficulties for the general public, because the education that the people have received in the past has never taught them the necessity of establishing an agreement with Germany. However, because I love my country so much, I have no time to worry about my own reputation. I must fulfill the responsibilities of the head of the government. I dare to tell you clearly that</p>
<p>This Policy</p>
<p>is the only broad road for France to save itself, and it is enough to guarantee the development of future peace. Please believe and follow me, and work together. Then, I will be fortunate, and the country will be fortunate. In the past few weeks, I have repeatedly met with military leaders, provincial governors, journalists, labor and management representatives, and representatives of veterans to talk to them. I have spoken frankly and honestly, saying everything without reservation. Since I</p>
<p>Took Office as Chief</p>
<p>only two months ago, I know that I have been recognized by the people. You must know that the government is now encountering new difficulties. The British invasion of our Madagascar and the American intervention in our West Indies are the most obvious examples. When I took office as the head of the government, everyone believed that improving relations with Germany would reduce France's suffering from</p>
<p>Defeat in the war. At that time, the families of our war prisoners had great hope. Even I personally hoped to do my best for this matter. At one point, our prisoners did have hope of returning home. Unfortunately, since Germany was at war with the Soviet Union, the manpower that our prisoners could provide was exactly what Germany needed, so this matter could not be resolved for a while. However,</p>
<p>The German Authorities</p>
<p>are generous and have already taken various preferential measures, such as allowing prisoners to take leave, and giving them the same treatment as ordinary workers, giving them wages, and even allowing their families to be taken to Germany for reunion, etc., and so on. Therefore, I have various reasons to believe that Head of State Hitler originally intended to take some lenient measures to treat our prisoners. Unexpectedly, a shocking event occurred. General Giraud suddenly escaped without a trace. As a result, the German government immediately notified our country, stating that all the conveniences given to the prisoners would be cancelled. This is regrettable, and it goes without saying. In recent years, France has been in a state of</p>
<p>Raw Material Shortage, and our factories are almost at a standstill. The number of unemployed workers is increasing day by day. On the contrary, Germany is in great need of manpower. In this situation, our prisoners seem to have a new hope. I know that our workers have always been treated with a spirit of benevolence and compassion, so I have decided to make another appeal to you,</p>
<p>A Plea for Help,</p>
<p>because the lives of our prisoners depend entirely on our workers in the future. If the workers can agree to go to work in Germany, they will surely be welcomed by Germany. On the one hand, it can allow the prisoners to return home, and on the other hand, for the workers themselves, they can get higher wages and send part of them back to France to support their families. In the future, a large number of French workers will live in Germany for a long time, get along with the German people in harmony, and sign contracts like comrades, and take leave to return home on a regular basis. Workers across the country should understand the importance of my appeal this time. At this time when Germany is willing to sacrifice for the construction of a new Europe, we should not turn a deaf ear. One day, our country will have to negotiate a peace treaty with Germany. French workers, the recovery of our war prisoners depends on you now. They fought for you before and have suffered the pain of being prisoners. That's why I don't hesitate to appeal to you, because I want to find a way to free them. Head of State Hitler has recently decided to release a large number of</p>
<p>War Prisoners to Return to Farming.</p>
<p>Once you arrive in Germany, you can see it being implemented. If you can go to work in Germany so that a large number of war prisoners can return to their homes and reunite with their families, their wives and children will surely be grateful to you. In the past, our soldiers gave their lives to protect the domestic workers. Today, it is time for the workers to repay the soldiers. French compatriots, your trip to Germany will be to release our war prisoners, and it will also be for the benefit of the country. Not only that, but France can also</p>
<p>Restore its due position in the new Europe.</p>
<p>I dare to say that this war is different from the past, because this is a revolutionary war, and a new Europe will surely emerge. You don't need to doubt the new system of France, because the future France will surely be a vigorous and strong republic, and socialism will surely spread throughout Europe. In France, this will be based on its own characteristics and adopt a political system suitable for our country. Fellow countrymen,</p>
<p>Marshal Pétain is a great warrior, who has devoted his life to serving the country and working diligently. He is now leading our country and striving for revival. Tonight, I am speaking on his behalf. The Marshal will also personally tell you that France must never have a history without France. Relying on the Marshal's perseverance, I firmly believe that our country will turn things around.</p>

<p>The police department is still investigating stores that do not comply with the authorities' notice and will be punished separately. Most of the stores that violated the regulations claimed that their prices were calculated according to the black market, but the French authorities believe that the soaring prices are all due to this, so this defense cannot be adopted.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Small Denomination Old Legal Tender Continued to be Exchanged Today <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The deadline for the exchange of old legal tender expired on the 21st. The exchange deadline for remote towns such as Taicang, Yangzhou, Ningbo, and Taixian will be extended to the 30th of this month due to inconvenient transportation. All eleven cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Suzhou will stop exchanging old legal tender on the 21st and prohibit its circulation. However, because the Shanghai urban area is vast and many merchants and residents have not been able to exchange their old legal tender, the Old Currency Consolidation Committee has specially set up four exchange points on the Bund, Avenue de Messy, Nanshi, and at its offices to handle small denomination exchanges. The exchange will continue today (24th).</p>
<p>Qian Dagui's Talk</p>
<p>Yesterday, Qian Dagui, the chairman of the Old Currency Consolidation Committee, said that the use of old currency is prohibited from the 25th, starting with Nanjing and Shanghai as the implementation areas. It is stipulated that except for the subsidiary currency notes issued by the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, the use of all other old currency is prohibited. Those who violate the regulations and use old currency will have their old currency confiscated, and those with minor offenses will be punished in accordance with the Police Violation Punishment Law. Those with serious offenses will be punished in accordance with the Provisional Regulations on Punishing Crimes Against the New Legal Tender. It is reported that the exchange of old currency in Shanghai should have ended on the 21st. However, on the last day of the 21st, from morning to night, all exchange points were extremely crowded, making it difficult to complete the exchange in a short time. In the last few days, most of those who exchanged at the committee's offices were small businesses and laborers. Therefore, the committee will continue to handle small denomination exchanges for those who have not been able to exchange their old legal tender for the next three days. After the implementation of the measures to prohibit the use of old currency from the 25th of this month, the use of old currency will be a violation of the law. It is hoped that citizens will pay close attention to this. As for the subsidiary currency notes issued by the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, they will still be circulated at half the price of the new legal tender currency notes and have not changed and are not within the scope of the prohibition.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Rice Purchase Certificates for Citizens to be Issued on the 4th of Next Month, Date of Rice Distribution Still to be Determined and Announced <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The first step in the rationing of rice in the two concessions, the issuance of rice purchase certificates, has begun on the 22nd. The date of implementation of the second step, the distribution of rice, will be announced after it is determined. The rationing of rice is carried out in parallel. Starting from the 22nd, every two days is a group, limiting taxpayers in designated blocks to collect certificates from the certificate issuing offices in their districts. The certificate collection dates are twelve days in total, divided into six groups. The distribution of dates for each group is as follows: June 22-23, June 24-25, June 26-27 (June 28 is Sunday, no certificate issuing), June 29-30, July 1-2, July 3-4. The issuance of rice purchase certificates in the International Settlement can be completed by 5 pm on July 4. The issuance in the French Concession can also be completed by 6 pm on the same day. July 5 is the preparation time for determining the retail rice shops that sell household rice and the residents who collect household rice. The official implementation of rice distribution will begin on July 6. The above are all planned plans. Whether there are any changes will be determined at any time.</p>
<p>Rice Collection Dates for Rice Shops</p>
<p>The rice shops that have signed retail contracts with the Municipal Council Rice Management Committee have previously announced 414 in the International Settlement and 243 in the French Concession. Recently, two more shops have paid their deposits, so there are a total of 659 shops. All the above rice shops are required to pay and collect the first retail rice for household rationing by June 30. The number of bags varies depending on the population density around the rice shop, with a maximum of 200 bags and a minimum of 30 bags. All are required to pay and collect rice once a week.</p>
<p>Blocks for Certificate Collection Tomorrow in Various Police Districts of the French Concession</p>
<p>Regarding the issuance of rice purchase certificates, the French Concession has previously issued a notice. The French authorities are now issuing a notice again that the second landlords, namely the heads of households, in the following blocks are required to go to their respective jurisdictions to collect rice purchase certificates starting at 8 am on the 25th of this month (Thursday).</p>

<p>The economic cafeteria jointly run by the Student Economic Aid Committee and the Chinese YMCA, originally located at the old YMCA on Sichuan Road, will temporarily suspend its student section until the beginning of September due to soaring prices.

<p>Industrialist Xie Xiaochu has been suffering from stomach problems. Since assisting in handling important materials after December 8, he has been overworked, causing his old illness to recur last month. After resting for several weeks, various associations have asked him to resume his duties as soon as possible due to the heavy workload and the need for someone to preside over them. It is reported that Mr. Xie has agreed to take office, but because his health has not fully recovered and he runs many businesses, he will only limit himself to associations related to his own business and the Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce. He cannot take care of other organizations. He has already issued a statement in the newspaper yesterday.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the International Settlement will soon conduct a survey of all foreign residents in the Settlement for the purpose of issuing citizen certificates and registering them for the purpose of distributing food evenly in the future. This survey will be conducted by the Foreign Affairs Section of the International Settlement Baojia Committee with the assistance of police officers. It is also learned that various foreign associations will also assist in the survey. The exact date of implementation of the survey has not yet been determined, but it is said that it is not far off. Although the complete plan for the implementation of the survey has not yet been finalized, it is generally believed that these foreign residents will register with their national overseas Chinese associations or with the police station in their area of residence. Recent rumors that foreign men will serve in the self-defense corps have not been confirmed by well-informed sources. It is said that there is absolutely no need for foreigners to serve in the Baojia. It is expected that the full details of the survey of foreign residents will be announced soon.</p>

<p>Zhou Xiuying, a young woman from Suzhou in her early twenties, beautiful and graceful, lived with her mother, Zhou Guiying, at 38, Datong Apartment, Lane 29, Fuxu Road. Last winter, while working as a dance hostess at the Jinshan Ballroom, she met Zheng Yuzhi, a Teochew insurance agent (resident at 86, Siming Lane, Xiafei Road), and fell in love at first sight. Later, they engaged in physical relations at the Huangong Hotel on Zhejiang Road. Afterward, their love deepened, and they rented a house to live together at 75, Lane 41, Ta’erfeisi Road in the French Concession. This past spring, Zheng suddenly lost his job, and they faced dire economic straits. Zhou then returned to her former profession, working as a dance hostess at the Xinhua Ballroom on Edward VII Avenue. At the same time, they moved to 16 Maitesi Road, which allowed them to barely make ends meet. Unexpectedly, Zheng's wife discovered the affair, went to the house, beat Zhou, and took away her watch and coat. From then on, Zhou and Zheng broke off their relationship. However, Zheng soon returned to pester her. Unable to bear the harassment, Zhou quit dancing several times. On the evening of the 19th of this month, at 11 p.m., Zheng opened room 37, on the fourth floor of the Xindu Apartment in Daodeli, Beile Road, and asked Zhou to come, intending to rekindle their romance. Although Zhou arrived as agreed, she reproached Zheng for his heartlessness, which led to an argument. Zhou was also confined indoors by Zheng, not allowed to leave for thirty hours. On the morning of the 21st, at 7 a.m., Zhou suddenly felt weary of the world and jumped out of the window to commit suicide, suffering severe injuries on the spot and tragically losing her life. Afterward, the apartment’s management reported the incident to the police, who arrested Zheng. Upon completion of the investigation, the police will file a public prosecution against Zheng according to the law.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Evacuation Ship Departure Date Swiss Consulate Says Delay of Two or Three Days <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>According to the English-language Da Mei Wanbao, Zhen Zhi, the director of the translation department of the Japanese Consulate-General, told reporters that the departure date of the evacuation ship "Kantofan 第号" would only be delayed for a few days. The Swiss Consulate also stated that the ship would be delayed by two or three days from its original departure date. According to reliable sources, another evacuation ship, "Asama Maru," is actually still in Yokohama, contrary to previous reports that the ship had already departed with evacuees on board. As for the departure date of "Kantofan 第号", the Japanese Consulate-General in this city has not yet received official news. Both Japanese and Swiss officials said that the exact date of the ship's departure has not been decided. This sudden postponement of the ship's departure allows evacuees sufficient time for farewells. However, as luggage has already been handed over to the Nippon Yusen Kaisha shipping company, many are now living a vagrant life. It is also heard that whether there will be a final change to the list of evacuating foreigners is yet to be announced. The ship's delayed departure may be due to this reason.</p>

<p>Recently, incidents of vehicle accidents still occur from time to time. Yesterday at around 1:30 p.m., at the intersection of Xiafei Road and Du Road, an old man was struck in the foot by a car, causing him to fall to the ground suddenly. Because his head hit the ground very hard, he immediately lost consciousness and was rushed to the hospital by the car that caused the accident. At around 2 p.m. yesterday, at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Kade Road, a boy of about ten years old was walking on the road and was knocked down and injured by a bicycle ridden by someone. He has been sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>After the French authorities announced that all businesses operating within the concession must pay a 2% retail tax on goods starting this month, they have already issued two identical forms, one positive and one negative, to each business, to be filled out with their business income, with a 2% tax to be levied. However, because the date of payment is unclear, many businesses within the concession have printed the forms and sent the amount due to the tax collection section in recent days, but all have been returned. This is because the tax is based on the entire income for June and is paid the following month.</p>

<p>French Ambassador Cosme came to Shanghai earlier and was very busy handling daily official matters. He gave many instructions to the French Concession authorities regarding their regular work. He also inspected all the members of the fire brigade at the playground of the Xiafei Road Municipal Council a few days ago and awarded medals. Because there were matters in Beiping, Mr. Cosme left Shanghai for Beiping at around 8 a.m. yesterday. The Director-General of the French Municipal Council, Tan Gutu, the French Consul-General, Majieli, and senior police officers all went to see him off.</p>
<h3 id="e35">General Police Station Arrests Habitual Offender and Notorious Kidnapper Cao Guilin Was Involved in the Kidnapping of Cai Lanzhou, Hu Zude, and Other Cases <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Detectives from the General Police Station recently arrested three criminals from Jiangbei: Cao Guilin (aka Cao Xiaogui), Cao Ronglin, and Chen Mingrong (aka Xiao Daizi). After investigation, it was learned that Cao Guilin had, on November 3rd of the 26th year of the Republic of China, at 7:30 p.m., colluded with accomplices and armed with weapons, kidnapped local businessman Cai Lanzhou from the Mingyuelou Teahouse at 107 Mabal Road, intending to demand a ransom. On November 18th of the same year, at 8 a.m., he kidnapped five-year-old Hu Zude on Kainalu Yidingpan Road, extorting 20,000 yuan in ransom. On January 7th of last year, at 1:20 a.m., he robbed a Russian man named Harry Raisim of a diamond ring at the Post Office at 23 Bailinan Road and shot and wounded the Russian man. Cao Guilin and Chen Mingrong are also related to two armed robbery cases involving residents on Maigen Road. The suspects were escorted for questioning yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Victim Identification</p>
<p>According to the victim, Cai Lanzhou, on the day in question, when I was enjoying tea at Mingyuelou, five bandits suddenly arrived, used Mauser pistols to force me into a pre-hired car, and drove me to a straw shed in Caojiadu. After several hours, I suddenly heard gunshots nearby (actually, the police were arresting thieves in another case). The kidnappers were frightened and dragged me out, ordering me to hide next to a nearby stream. After a while, I saw the guard flee, so I took the opportunity to escape to the Putuo Road Police Station to report the incident. He also pointed out in court that Cao Guilin was one of the bandits. Another victim, Hu Zude, 11 years old, testified that on the day in question, while on his way to school, he was forced into a car by four bandits, held in a straw shed, and forced to write two ransom letters. He was released after more than two months. He also pointed out in court that Cao Guilin was present. Hu Qichang testified that Zude was his son. After he was kidnapped, the bandits called, demanding a ransom of five million yuan and instructing a well-known figure in Shanghai to negotiate on their behalf. I invited two people to contact them but failed. Later, my old family servant, Yang Faji, repeatedly contacted them, and the ransom was eventually paid with 20,000 yuan. The court ordered the defendants to be detained pending a rescheduled review.</p>

<p>According to the Allied News Agency, in order to seek assistance from the commercial and industrial groups of the Axis powers in Shanghai in promoting the implementation of the materials movement system currently in place in the Shanghai area, the Japanese Consulate-General in Shanghai held the first informal meeting between the Japanese authorities and members of the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Italian Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai at the Cathay Hotel on the 22nd. Most of the authoritative figures from the Axis powers in Shanghai attended the meeting and expressed their willingness to fully cooperate with the Japanese economic control. More than 20 German representatives attended, including Consul Ganer, Commercial Officer Wentaifuerte, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry Getuo, and Director Fu Aoshi. More than 10 Italian representatives attended, including Deputy Consul Xiao Luo. Mr. Getuo, chairman of the German Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai and chairman of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said in his speech at the meeting that the German giants of Shanghai's commerce and industry are assisting Japan in implementing materials movement control and promoting Japanese-German economic cooperation.

<h3 id="e37">Moufu Steamer Leaves Dock Moored on Huangpu River Pontoon Name of Voyage and Ship Not Yet Finalized <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The Moufu steamer of the German firm Lihe 洋行 entered the dock for repairs after returning to Shanghai. It has now left the dock and is moored on pontoons 22 and 23 on the Huangpu River to continue minor repairs. A reporter from Datong News Agency inquired with the Ningshao Company on Ningbo Road yesterday and learned that the ship is still under repair after leaving the dock. The ship was also washed the day before yesterday. Rumors that the ship would test its engine on the 25th and sail on July 1st are completely false. Currently, whether the ship's name will be restored to its original name of Xin Ningshao, or whether it will be leased, or whether the company will continue to operate it, has not been determined. The total cost of this ship repair is about 500,000 yuan. Before the war, it would have been only 20,000 to 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Da Steamer Sails to Jiangbei</p>
<p>The Gaodeng steamer of the German firm Lulin 洋行 has now been rerouted to the Jiangbei route and has been renamed Dafeng Steamer. It has already sailed several voyages. The ship sailed from Shanghai on the 21st, and the next sailing date is scheduled for the 26th. It will stop at all ports along the Jiangbei route.</p>

<p>On the 8th of last month, the Xinfengxiang Jewelry Store at 580 Xinzha Road was suddenly broken into by several bandits, who robbed four diamond rings worth 40,000 yuan. The bandits fled without a trace. Now, Han Kaiyuan, a Chinese detective from the Jing'an Temple Police Station, has arrested Wu Zhonghua, one of the bandits involved in the case. It was found that Wu previously worked as a bodyguard for Li De (aka Da Ban), the director of the Chinese General Association. He has been ordered to be taken into custody pending investigation and transfer.</p>

<p>Jue Garden at 118 Hed Road in West Shanghai was originally the Nanyuan Garden of the late Mr. Jian Zhaonan, owner of the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company. The houses are magnificent, the flowers in the garden compete in beauty, the green shade covers the sky, and the lake pavilion, the Nine-Bend Bridge, and the Bodhi tree are spectacular. Nanyuan Garden was once one of the famous gardens in Shanghai. After several vicissitudes, people left and the buildings were empty, making one feel a sense of melancholy.</p>
<p>Motivation for Founding</p>
<p>Mr. Jian was a Buddhist believer. There is a temple in the garden, with a grand main hall, standing in a corner. Four or five people are employed to chant scriptures and worship. There is also an attached Buddhist Jingye Society, with a lecture hall where comrades are invited to join the society to study Buddhism and promote the true meaning of Buddhism. Since Mr. Jian's death, the Jingye Society has continued to exist. In June of the year before last, in view of the large number of orphans in Shanghai and the need for relief for those who are displaced, the Jingye Orphanage was founded. More than one hundred people have been successively taken in to date, either sent by the Municipal Council's Guarantee Department or sent by the International Relief Committee.</p>
<p>Teaching Methods</p>
<p>According to reporter Zhao Puc Chu Jun, most of the internal orphans are sent by the Municipal Council's Guarantee Department for education and upbringing. Among them are petty thieves and pickpockets, and it is really difficult to educate them, The ages range from eight or nine to seventeen or eighteen years old, and their bad habits are too ingrained. They often beat and scold others, and it is impossible to reason with them. Therefore, the daily curriculum only includes Chinese language and arithmetic, and the teachers compile their own lectures, using aphorisms such as "Study hard with perseverance, do not scold or fight." Classes are held for two hours in the morning, and work is done in the afternoon, adopting a half-work, half-study system. There are seven workshops: rattan, bamboo, leather shoes, suits, Chinese clothing, rabbit breeding, and net weaving, all with technicians hired to teach the skills. The wages earned are properly kept by the orphanage. When this reporter visited, the students were in class. Before long, it was time for lunch. As soon as the monitor rang the bell, they lined up and entered the dining hall in an orderly fashion.</p>
<p>Work and Supply</p>
<p>Some of the orphans in the orphanage have gradually been brought back on the right track. Cooking, washing clothes, cleaning rooms, tidying up bedding, and washing dishes are all done by the students themselves. The teachers guide them patiently. In terms of diet, they have three meals a day, eating thin porridge with crushed wheat, corn, sorghum, and white rice. In terms of clothing, about 50,000 yuan is needed for the whole year. The orphanage has stored some cloth, and the students' clothes are made from flour sacks to reduce the burden.</p>
<p>Current Situation</p>
<p>However, the most difficult thing at present is funding. At the beginning, there were only more than 20,000 yuan, which was enough for one year's expenses. Now, prices have soared, suddenly increasing to 200,000 yuan for the whole year's expenses. Moreover, the Relief Association used to provide some assistance, but now it does not. The situation is precarious, and there is no way to appeal. We sincerely hope that all sectors of society will provide assistance so that these hundred or so orphans can still receive a good education in such an environment.</p>

He went out shopping at 3:00 p.m. on June 17 and has gone missing. He was wearing a blue lined single robe, cloth shoes, and carrying a black cane. He has a short beard. He has not yet returned home, causing his old wife, children, and other five family members to search everywhere, extremely anxious.

<h3 id="e43">Datong Safe Deposit Boxes to Be Opened on Behalf of Customers Bank Not Responsible HSBC Safe Deposit Boxes Still Freely Accessible <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>According to responsible personnel at the Datong Bank on the Bund yesterday, the bank had previously sent letters to all safe deposit box customers, ordering them to come to the bank's vault to open their safe deposit boxes before June 10, otherwise the bank would automatically open them. In consideration of depositors residing in other cities, although there are still more than 200 safe deposit boxes whose customers have not opened them, the bank has not yet started the process. However, in the near future, once the sorting procedures are completed, the bank will no longer expect customers to come and will automatically open them. Furthermore, the bank will change the numbers of the safe deposit boxes and will not be responsible for any items placed in the boxes, regardless of their value. Although the bank's office hours are from 9:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m., the opening time for safe deposit boxes is only two hours per day, from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. It is also learned that the McGreggor Bank has already opened on behalf of customers the items deposited in safe deposit boxes by depositors who have not come to open them, but is still responsible for their safekeeping. As for the safe deposit boxes at the HSBC Bank vault, they are different from those of other banks because the bank's safe deposit boxes are old-fashioned and have a spare key kept at the bank. Therefore, even if the customer does not bring a key to open the box in person, the bank can still open the items deposited in the safe deposit box by the customer. As such, the bank has not ordered depositors to come and open their boxes by any date, and depositors can freely open and close their safe deposit boxes and are not subject to any restrictions from the bank. As for the aforementioned Datong Bank, it is heard that, in addition to the more than 200 boxes that have not been opened by depositors, the depositors of the remaining more than 2,000 safe deposit boxes have already gone to open them due to the bank's notice of a deadline for opening.</p>
<p>Letter</p>
<p>Dear Sir, I have recently been entrusted by Zhu Yimin of Yicheng Osmanthus Cake Shop to state that the news item entitled "Fictitious Silver Shop Swindles Remittances" published in your newspaper's local news section is not consistent with the facts. After investigation, Yimin has been running Yicheng Osmanthus Cake Shop for many years. This time, Chen Qilian, who lives with him, was entrusted by Yikang Silver Shop in Suzhou to handle the collection and remittance of funds. After Yikang went bankrupt, he was implicated in a fraud case. However, the case has absolutely nothing to do with me or my apprentice, Zhu Peibin. The above-mentioned sections, which relate to my reputation, are deeply afraid of causing misunderstandings from all walks of life. For this reason, I have entrusted a representative to send a letter to your editor-in-chief to request a correction. This is to the Shen Bao Newspaper Office, Lawyer Fan Gang, June 23, 31st year.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Typhus Is Not a Terminal Illness Treatment Method of a Traditional Chinese Medicine Doctor <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Typhus has recently caused many to blanch in fear, especially Westerners. However, traditional Chinese medicine doctors have always been most concerned with the Treatise on Cold Damage, and the analysis and identification of principles have accumulated over time to become a grand view. In view of the general public’s excessive fear, I dare to offer my knowledge.</p>
<p>Typhus was formerly known as Heat Epidemic Disease, also known as Epidemic Rash, and popularly called Geda Wen. At the onset, the symptoms are initially chills, followed by fever, headache, back pain, abdominal churning (i.e., colic), vomiting, no sweat on the lower body, and juice on the upper body, with even more head sweat. The face is swollen and flushed, and there is drowsiness and delirium. In severe cases, the patient becomes comatose in one or two days. After three to five days, red rashes appear, and even red spots. The pulse is opposite to that of typhoid fever (according to typhoid fever, the pulse is slow and inconsistent with the heat). The pulse increases along with the fever. Bowel movements are mostly constipation, but there are also cases of foul-smelling watery stools.</p>
<p>The process generally involves "severe chills and fever at the beginning, rapid pulse, body pain, headache, feverishness, and delirium at night." Rashes appear after three to five days, and the fever subsides slightly, then rises again. In the second week, the condition worsens, with confusion, delirium, pillow digging, bed touching, flailing of the hands and feet, teeth grinding, convulsions, red tongue with black coating, and incontinence of both urine and feces, leading to death.</p>
<p>Nature—It is the most dangerous of typhoid fevers, with the fastest progression and transformation.</p>
<p>The cause is malnutrition and unclean living conditions. Therefore, this disease often occurs in ships, prisons, and densely populated areas, and during times of severe drought, those with weak resistance (low blood, weak heart) and a diet that is biased towards meat and lacking in vegetables are most susceptible to it.</p>
<p>Location of the Virus—Initially in the blood vessels and heart, then entering the brain.</p>
<p>Treatment—Treatment must begin immediately, because in critical cases, the poison will quickly enter the brain before the second week. Traditional Chinese medicine says that evil enters the pericardium. The main prescription is Yu Shiyu's Yu Shiyu was a person from the early Qing Dynasty from Anhui, contemporary with Ji Wenda Gong. Qing Wen Bai Du Yin, the main ingredients are as follows: raw gypsum, fresh rehmannia, rhinoceros horn, Sichuan rhubarb, gardenia, platycodon, skullcap, anemarrhena, red peony, scrophularia, Yunnan Qiaogan grass, Moutan bark, and fresh bamboo leaves. Large amounts of Da Qing Ye and Ban Lan Gen can also be added. If the poison enters the brain, use antelope horn, dragon teeth, bear bile, and Lian Zhu powder. For mild cases with little sweat and a floating, large, and rapid pulse, use Platycodon Grandiflorum Decoction, with the following formula: Platycodon, gardenia, forsythia, skullcap, licorice, mint, and raw gypsum.</p>
<p>Both prescriptions are found in Wang Mengying's Wen Re Jing Wei, with the addition of Mutong, Juncus effusus, adzuki bean, Lygodium japonicum, Ze Lan, and Gromwell root to excrete evil toxins from the blood.</p>
<p>Do not use Glauber's salt or rhubarb to purge the bowels, and do not take diaphoretics. If the tongue is dry and cracked, saliva is lacking, and there is severe thirst, you can take fresh and clean sweet tangerine juice and Dendrobium decoction to protect the patient's body fluids. During the corresponding period, the use of ginseng and Agrimony pilosa has a particularly noticeable effect. If the virus has penetrated deep into the brain and the original energy is exhausted, it is often incurable.</p>
<p>Things that the family should pay attention to: Check the patient's body for fleas and lice, whether they have been in contact with poor people and dirty families, and whether the patient has red rashes and spots.</p>
<p>Forbidden prescriptions and medications: cinnamon twigs, ephedra, Yihuang, Glauber's salt, aconite, cinnamon, and large amounts of fermented soybeans, bean curd skin, Perilla leaves, duckweed, and all diaphoretic and purgative agents except gypsum. Furthermore, several medicines such as musk and storax must also be avoided. (Hua Xingruo)</p>

<h3 id="e50">After Three Days of Decline, Public Bonds Experience a Slight Rebound <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The unofficial public bond market experienced a slight rebound yesterday after three consecutive days of decline. However, large-scale selling by major players remained significant, impacting the extent of the rebound. The underlying situation and trend still suggest a strong upward trajectory, with no signs of loosening in the available securities. A pause in selling is needed to restore the previous upward momentum. Yesterday, Tongli was the largest seller, accounting for nearly three-quarters of total transactions. Dalai also sold heavily, while others such as Hu Heji, Tongyuan, Wuhe, Dechang, and Gongmao also reduced their holdings. Hongxing and Xinji were the primary buyers, with Tongshun, Lianyi, Tongkang, Dakang, Hongda, and others also buying in. Pressure from short sellers slightly hampered the upward momentum on the trading floor, but prices ultimately rebounded by two to five jiao across the board. Approximately 2 million yuan worth of transactions took place. A brief summary table is provided below: Category, Highest, Lowest, Closing Price, Compared to Previous Day.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Huagu Transactions Remain Flat <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>

<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday, sentiment in the cloth market remained weak, with a sharp decline in prices. Widespread selling by small and floating holders continued unabated. New long positions hesitated due to various rumors, causing the market to plummet. Peach Blossom Lady Lin opened in the morning at 284 yuan, falling to 277 yuan, with an afternoon closing at 280 yuan and further decline in the after-market to 276.5 yuan, a substantial drop of eleven to twelve yuan per bolt.

<p>Eastern Cloth: Yesterday, prices for all cloths declined in unison due to the sharp drop in yarn prices. The leading fine cloth, new stock, has broken through the 200 yuan barrier. It opened in the morning at 202 yuan, falling to 193 yuan, with a slight rebound in the afternoon closing at 196 yuan.

<p>Domestic sales of soybean cake have weakened due to transportation difficulties, leading to a softer market and prices one to two yuan lower than previously. 57.5 yuan was the price for the Fung Kee soy cake May warehouse receipts, fifty yuan for the Lee brand soy cake April 500-piece warehouse receipts, also the price was 57 yuan to 58 yuan for May's one thousand piece warehouse receipts, 54.2 yuan to 50 yuan was the price for the Sang Kee soy cake May's one thousand and five hundred piece old warehouse receipt, 55 yuan to 53.5 yuan for June's two thousand piece old warehouse receipt, 53 yuan for July's five hundred piece old warehouse receipt, and fifty-nine yuan to fifty-seven yuan the price for April's 1,000-piece new warehouse receipt, also sold at 59.5 yuan for June's 500-piece warehouse receipt.</p>

<p>Trading in beans remained slow yesterday, with scarce supply and demand due to increased transportation difficulties and reduced actual sales due to high prices. The market was generally quiet, with mixed prices. Broad beans generally had good retail sales and rose by three to five yuan. Red beans were being sold off by scattered holders, showing signs of fatigue. There was little other activity. 30 bags of new Qing broad beans from Hongqiao were sold at 170 yuan, and 10 bags of sand broad beans from Chongming at 115 yuan.

<p>The first batch of new black leaf lychees from Guangdong is reported to have been shipped to Shanghai for market testing in eight boxes.

<p>Daily necessities prices have fallen for several consecutive days. As the authorities actively stabilize prices, speculators inside and outside the industry have successively withdrawn, leading to a quiet market with few transactions. For example, Gu Ben soap is at 305 yuan per case, Bai Xiangmao soap at 270 yuan, Huang Xiangmao soap at 225 yuan, and Arrow Knife soap at 270 yuan, all down by about five yuan from previous levels. Phoenix brand candles are at 3,500 yuan, Beauty brand at 3,600 yuan, miscellaneous brands at 2,500 yuan, Golden Cauldron brand at 2,800 yuan, Whiteley's foreign candles at 130 yuan, and Monk's Hat brand at 125 yuan, all showing a lack of both buyers and sellers.</p>

<p>Cigarette market activity has been quite flat for the past two days. Following the currency reform, various parties are taking a wait-and-see approach amid the authorities' efforts to stabilize prices, resulting in few transactions. Traded prices include Great Britain brand at 8,350 yuan, Old Knife brand at 5,300 yuan, Pin Hai brand at 4,500 yuan, Wu Hua brand at 3,850 yuan, Fairy brand at 4,000 yuan, Japanese cigarette Golden Gun brand at 1,750 yuan, Golden Building at 2,250 yuan, Red Rose brand at 1,325 yuan, Quan Lu brand at 1,950 yuan, Compass brand at 1,450 yuan, White Five Rings at 1,000 yuan, domestic cigarette Golden Mouse brand at 1,950 yuan, Beauty brand at 3,600 yuan, and White Golden Dragon at 2,300 yuan, all showing declines. However, black market prices for various brands are all falling below market prices. It remains uncertain whether limited price controls will be extended to consumables in the future. Compared to other daily necessities, there is a vast difference. However, cigarettes are typically calculated at a 20% discount, making it difficult to predict future price movements.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Review of Huang Guiqiu's Performances <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Qing</p>
<p>I have seen Nie Huang Guiqiu in "Golden Lock Record," "Sacrificing to the Yangtze River," "Yutang Chun," and "Cosmic Peak." Among these, I am most satisfied with "Golden Lock Record," followed by "Sacrificing to the Yangtze River," then "Yutang Chun," and "Cosmic Peak."</p>
<p>"Golden Lock Record" is a Qingyi Zheng Gong opera. Mei Lanfang often performs "June Snow," but only Cheng Yanqiu and Huang Guiqiu perform "Golden Lock Record." The appealing aspects lie entirely in the slow melody during the imprisonment scene and the extended counter-melody on the execution ground. However, these two parts are also the most challenging. If sung poorly, the audience will find them tedious and valueless. Although the plot involves superstition, it serves as a warning against foolishness and remains a good play.</p>
<p>Huang Guiqiu is suited for the role of Dou E, portraying her with dignity and composure. She and Cheng Yanqiu are a natural pair for the role of Dou E. Cheng Yanqiu sings the part on the execution ground better than the part during the imprisonment scene in this opera, while Huang Guiqiu is the opposite, with the part during the imprisonment scene surpassing that of the execution ground. Balancing each other out, they are equally matched, with no clear winner. Her pleading with Aunt Jin and her spoken words before execution, with a soft voice, poignant sorrow, and a hint of shyness and resentment, truly rend the heart and are unbearable to hear. Therefore, "Golden Lock Record" ranks first among the four plays. The second should be "Sacrificing to the Yangtze River," which is a continuation of the "Lianyun Village" story, based on the</p>
<p>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</p>
<p>Roughly, it tells the story of "Dong Wu's Lü Meng seizing Jingzhou by surprise, Guan Gong returning to Maicheng in defeat, Zhang Fei rushing to avenge his brother, resulting in his murder by Fan Jiang and Zhang Da, Shu's ruler Liu Bei launching a campaign to avenge his brother, repeatedly defeating Dong Wu, later being defeated by Lu Xun's fire attack, burning over seven hundred miles of linked camps, at that time wrongly conveying Liu Bei's death in the military, Sun's wife, upon hearing of it, personally journeyed to the riverside to prepare a sacrifice for the distant memorial service, because of remembering the former leader, she then throws herself into the river and dies". The sacrificing to the river incident, in official histories is not recorded, Pihuang operas mostly take as their basis unofficial histories, often recklessly adding speculations, disregarding the presence or absence of matters, indeed is not just one play that is Sacrificing to the River. That day's husband Liu Bei by Ji Yuliang, he who takes the role of Guan Yu is Xiao San Mazi. Xiao San Mazi is the rather famous Hong Sheng in Jiangnan, other than singing technique not overtaking Lin Shusen, the rest are a bit more superior. Now he is the fundamental actor of Golden Stage. Huang Guiqiu is</p>
<p>a legitimate student of De Lin</p>
<p>Therefore, the performance of "Sacrificing to the Yangtze River" retains the old style. The singing, acting, and recitation all resemble De Lin. Her voice is very gentle, and she can handle both high and low notes. In short, "Sacrificing to the Yangtze River" is a play that emphasizes singing ability, and those with less skill often dare not attempt it. Guiqiu, however, has unique insights into this type of old play, so it can rank second among the four plays. The third play is "Yutang Chun," which I have already written about in general terms, so I will omit it here. The last play is "Cosmic Peak." The most difficult part of this play is not the "I will feign madness here" passage, but the expression while singing this counter-melody. This hesitant expression must match not only the lyrics but also the movements of the mute servant. It is</p>
<p>very difficult to portray.</p>
<p>Huang Guiqiu is naturally intelligent, so she gains a lot of advantages in this area. In the scene of feigning madness in the golden palace, she can embody the words "chastity," "passion," "娇," "羞," and "anger." Her spoken rebuke of Qin Er Shi is both firm and gentle but lacks clarity. This play is good but not as good as the previous three, so it can only rank fourth.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Scripts and Audience <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— Tao Shun Sheng</p>
<p>Ever since Fei Mu directed plays such as "Confucius" and "Plum Blossom Dream," he has gained the admiration of audiences, who say that he is one of the best directors in both cinema and theater. He is usually very modest. Many arrogant and vain actors who think they are very talented should feel ashamed when they see him. Originally, modesty benefits while arrogance invites loss. Arrogant and vain people will eventually fail, while modest people will succeed.</p>
<p>Fei Mu does not say that he has studied theater but rather that he has a great interest in it. He says that he is currently worried about the problem of scripts. "There are several very good scripts, but unfortunately, due to the costumes and other reasons, they are not suitable for public performance in the summer. Theater is a performance by actors on stage for the audience, and when selecting scripts, in addition to considering whether the actors' abilities and the stage conditions are qualified, it is also necessary to consider whether the audience can accept them. A play without an audience is unimaginable. We would very much like to perform famous Chinese and foreign plays, but no one wants to see them! Often, what the audience wants is not an entire play but the story of the play. As long as the story is moving, they do not care about the quality of the play itself. So I want to find some suitable scripts to perform first, and when we have captured the audience, we can gradually change their interests and raise their standards for watching plays."</p>
<h3 id="e66">Cai Tan's Glory <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>

<p>The "Three Smiles" at the theater originally invited Chen Lu to play Qiu Xiang, but Chen is affiliated with the Weiming Troupe, so Tong Yi was replaced. Tong Yi has received much praise since "Floating Goose." Playing Qiu Xiang in "Three Smiles" this time, he should be able to fulfill the role happily.</p>
<p>Zheng Xiaoxiao directed, Hu Feng, Shu Shi, Xu Feng co-starred in "Brother and Brother", in order to suit the needs of the story, decided to change the name to "Romantic Family".</p>
<p>Xu Xinfu is recently preparing a new Chen Cha Li detective film, the protagonist is still Xu Xinyuan, Gu Meijun.</p>
<p>Li Pingqian directed "Madame Butterfly", has been completed last week, the second planned play is "Artistic Blood and Tears".</p>
<p>Bu Wancang's "Under the Peony Flower" will be completed within days, the next opening is "Two Generations of Women", intending to invite Yuan Meiyun to take the lead role.</p>
<p>Zhong Lian's "Spring" has been launched, but the lineup has changed a lot, the female actors include Zhou Manhua, Wang Danfeng, Chen Qi, Wang Muping, Zhang Cuiying, Zhang Fan, Yuan Zhuru, Huang Naishuang, Zhang Wan, Cang Yinqiu, etc., the male actors include Tu Guangqi, Xu Li, Yan Hua, Yan Jun, Jiang Ming, Xu Xinyuan, Zhang Zhizhi, etc.</p>
<p>Rongwei company after "Hero of the Desert Island" performs "Birds Flying Wing to Wing", what is currently being practiced is "Sherlock Holmes", "Widow's Asylum", etc.</p>
<p>Zhou Manhua in the summer is even more charming, she has been very busy lately, after filming "The Return of the Swallows", she is now starring in "Spring".</p>

<h3 id="e67">The Empress to Perform Spoken Drama <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Ping</p>
<p>Recently, the theater world is showing an unprecedentedly vigorous atmosphere, like the Rongwei Company powerfully occupying both the Lanxin and Longmen theaters, Sun Jinglu hosting the Carlton, Yang Naimei, Li Qinian and Bai Yun are also respectively on stage at the Lafayette, Green Treasure and Red Treasure, etc., and Tang Ruoqing is also breaking precedent by performing frequently at the Tiangong.</p>
<p>According to reliable sources yesterday, the Empress Grand Theater will also hold a short-term spoken drama performance. The partner of the Empress is the China Touring Theater. Because the China Touring Theater feels that the venue at Tiangong is not large enough to accommodate a large audience, and the Empress also intends to give up showing movies in the summer, the two hit it off and decided to work together to launch a brand new plan.</p>
<p>It is heard that the Empress side has filled all the summer equipment, and the China Touring Theater and Tiangong are also gathering manpower and resources to make various preparations. Around the end of next month, you can probably see the grand occasion of Shanghai's first round of movie theaters performing stage plays.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Review of The Flowery World <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— Hong Ying</p>
<p>We are already very familiar with the film scripts of Mr. Zhou Yibai; however, since "Li Xiangjun," we have not easily seen Mr. Zhou's stage scripts, and only now is there a new work, "The Flowery World," starring Tang Ruoqing, to meet with us.</p>
<p>We feel that the most commendable aspect of Zhou Yibai's scripts is that they firmly grasp social reality. Works like "New Sister Flowers" and "Happy Year After Year" give us a sense of closeness and reality. "The Flowery World" is also like this. It focuses on depicting the abnormal lives of professional girls in the metropolis, thoroughly writing about a female student who wants to seek her own independence, is tempted by vanity, and is finally ravaged by capitalists and falls into becoming a dancer. Such stories are too real and too many. Mr. Zhou portrayed the four-act process of the entire play very clearly, especially the personalities of the various characters, which were depicted appropriately.</p>
<p>Tang Ruoqing has rarely performed modern dramas before, but since achieving remarkable success with "Water Lily," she has consecutively starred in this new work. She once again appears in this play with a luxurious style. She throws herself into the arms of the capitalist Shao Hua but cannot have spiritual comfort, and finally mistakenly rushes to a youth with only outward appearances, Zhao Shu, and thus unfolds a grand tragedy. From comedy to tragedy, Tang Ruoqing, Shao Hua, and Zhao Shu, the three protagonists, all have valuable performances. As for the lighting and set design, they are all above the waterline.</p>

<p>(6) A Snap of the Fingers</p>
<p>Second Madam Ye spoke, wanting to hear how Wei Cheng would reply. Wei Cheng lifted his arm and scratched the back of his head. Second Madam Ye said: "Why aren't you speaking?" Cheng smiled: "Wasn't mother speaking on my behalf?" Second Madam Ye originally wanted to find out Wei Cheng's intentions, but now that Wei Cheng has replied in this way, she could not help but put on a smile and said: "Your uncle is not like Cui Zhen's uncle. Although he doesn't come often, he is very concerned about your affairs. You can't blindly imitate the sages. In everything, you have to see which way the wind blows. If your mother were alive, whether it was the first half of this year or the second half of this year, she would have proposed this marriage for you. One year, it was the year you graduated from senior primary school, right? Your mother let slip some information, saying that she was going to set a betrothal for her son. One person tells ten, ten people tell a hundred, and many relatives and friends sent the birth dates of girls. I remember that the box was completely full. A little later, there were probably hundreds of them. Your mother happily said, 'I only need one daughter-in-law, how did so many girls come? I guess Wei Cheng will have luck with the ladies in the future.' I joined in and said, 'When Wei Cheng gets married, we can paste these red papers all over the walls of a room, and it won't be in vain for those matchmakers to work so hard.'"</p>
<p>Wei Cheng smiled at his aunt and said: "In the past, our family's circumstances were better than they are now, and we didn't owe as much debt as we do now. Now it's a different story." Madam Ye said: "You can't say that. Whether our family's circumstances are good or bad depends on two things: one is to look at the crops in the fields, the cotton harvested, and the soybeans harvested. If we harvest more, that's good. The other is to look at you. You studied, graduated, and worked. If you have a job, that's good. If that's the case, the family's circumstances won't be worse than before. Wei Cheng, my burden is getting heavier day by day. I'm afraid of ruining the family's circumstances. On the one hand, I would be letting down your mother, and on the other hand, I would be letting down Shidetang, so I'm thinking about it day and night. Where can I divide this burden of mine and not let me carry it alone? It would be best if two people could carry it together." Wei Cheng looked at his aunt's expression and listened to what she said. How could he not understand? But he still asked, "Aunt, who do you want to share the weight of the burden with?" (110)</p>

<p>Since "Dragon Fight Tiger Battle" opened at Huguang, it has been unprecedentedly grand, and Shanghai movie fans have a very good impression of Manchukuo Film Association productions. It is heard that the movie coming after this one is "Rouge," which is also a large-scale costume film. The story is taken from the Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio story "Night Trial of Zhou Ziqin," which is the first time Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio has been brought to the screen. The plot is winding and strange, attracting the audience. The leading actress is the northeastern celebrity Ms. Zheng Xiaojun, with natural beauty and delicate acting skills, who has long been famous in the Guandong art world. Moreover, with her origins from a prominent family and her deep family learning, she has a subtle understanding of the character of film art, so every move she makes is tightly connected and moving in every way. She plays Guan Suda's Rouge, lewd but not vulgar, with ample charm, her surprised posture and lustful mood are amazing, other female actors include Zhao Aiping, Zhang Min, etc., all of whom are the first choice in the Northeast film industry.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Hunan Opera <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— Ze Fu</p>
<p>Hunan local opera has Han tune and Gao tune divisions. Although Han tune originated in Hubei, the singing method is different from Hubei Han tune due to language relations. However, the scripts and lyrics are often very similar or completely different. It is roughly the case that they were originally the same, but later the performers had to make slight changes in order to suit the local conditions, leading to divergences. In addition to Han tune, there are also small tunes such as Fengyang Flower Drum mixed in. Gao tune can be said to have evolved from Kunqu opera, because its script is completely the same as Kunqu opera, so those who are knowledgeable about historical anecdotes all say that Hunan opera evolved from Kunqu opera. However, the singing has undergone great changes to this day. There is no string or bamboo accompaniment when singing, only one person sings and others provide backing vocals. The instruments are drums, clappers, small gongs, and cymbals, which are played during the backing vocals. In addition, there are large suona horns, trumpets, and flutes, which are not used much, so the performance is extremely elegant and quite different from the Han tune. In the past, this kind of opera was only popular in villages and temple fairs. It was not until the end of the Guangxu reign that the Yichun Garden organization was established in Changsha, and then it was formally performed on the stage. In 1923, Chen Youcai and others organized the Hunan Opera female actors' Fortune and Prosperity Troupe, named Shou Chun Yuan, and it was the beginning of female actors performing Hunan Opera.</p>
