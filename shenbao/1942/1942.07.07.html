<p>阿刺伯人是一個偉大的民族，對於歐洲文化的貢獻，自有其特殊功業，為世人所不能否認的。關於道個民族，我們在近東專輯中，曾經介紹過他們幾個小的國家，可是僅就地勢和政治道兩點，作了一點簡單的提供，現在我們重把這個民族過去燦爛的歷史，作一有系統的概述，在這中東緊張局勢下，也許足資使助罷！</p>
<p>一·一般的講話</p>
<p>阿刺伯，中國史上稱為大食或天方。它是中國的老朋友。中國在亞洲大陸上有兩個老友，互相作過文化的交換。一個是印度，比較的近一點。一僩是阿刺伯，比較遠一點。印度的確給與了中國一些寳貴的東西。可是阿刺伯人給與中國的，却更寳貴更實用。而且印度人不曾建立過橫趨歐亞的大帝國，而阿刺伯人却建立過東西橫貫歐亞，以宗敎軍事政治及物質發明等等，演出過歷史七煊爛的名劇。它以經歷三百年照耀史乘的偉大民族，偉大帝國，與亞洲另一個偉大民族偉大帝國中國的唐代－－相對峙着，這眞是一個很有意義的偶合，値得大書特書的。</p>
<p>中國的一般人，好像不甚覺得有這樣一個歷史大民族存在，他們聽到大食這一個名詞，只是以為考古學者書簏中績存的古董。美國輸入中國的影片，也有如廷宮寳盒這類片子。可是那些翻譯說明書的匠人，簡直不知所云。把報達譯成了一個古怪的聲音，把喀立法譯作了皇帝。他們知阿刺伯實在太生疎了。他們的心版上，連淡淡的影子都沒有。</p>
<p>其實，我們只要一留心阿刺伯的文化的遺迹，就到處存在。敎門館的鷄鴨，架子上懸有一張照會似的東西，這就是阿刺伯文字。學校兒童日常演字的數字，一二三四五六七八九這幾個符號，就是阿刺伯人所發明的遺跡。我們所飮用的提人精神的加非，最初就出在阿刺伯沿江海的馬查地方，那是一種矮矮的灌木上所生的果子。也許從造地毯等類的束西，也是從阿刺伯人方面得來的一種技術。中國民間的傳說，有所謂回回收寳者，也是表明阿刺伯長于經商，與中國交往貿易的迹象。</p>
<p>中國的民族構成中，居于優秀和主體地位的，自然是漢挨。可是那有力量，有精神，有團結意識的，就得論到分布于西北及西南的回敎徒了。這些回敎徒，就其血統言，果然是土耳其人蒙古人和漢人的混合體，可是就推動的根本言，實在是阿刺伯民族，全世界民族，受阿刺伯民族推動而共入于回敎機搆之內者，也不能算多。－－北非的摩爾人，巴比爾人，埃及人，南段的土蘭人，中段的突厥入，小亞細亞的土耳人，還有中國西北的土蒙漢混合人－－而中國居然與回敎有其密切的關係，這不能不說是中國的一種光榮。－－然而這一種光榮，却為中國的一般人所忽略遺忘了。</p>
<p>按阿刺伯人之東來，實循了海陸兩條路錢。從陸路上來的，是推廣政治勢力軍事勢力的武人，但他們只是少數中之少數，實際上是土耳其人替他們推開了塲面的。從海路上來是，經營商業的商人，這些阿刺伯人，在中國沿海各地，成立據點，建設回敎大寺，與中國人密切接觸，他們從實際上擴展了自己門勢力，建樹了眞正的阿刺伯文化的基礎。</p>
<p>在中國的政治史上，阿刺伯人參加的分兒，也着實不小。唐太宗之得大下，借助於回敎徒之力甚多。蒙古人用回回大砲攻打金人的防錢，克奏膚功，完全利用了阿刺伯人的技術和人才。蒙古人進據中原以後，利用色目人為客卿，替兀胡的王　，作種種奇技淫巧的器物。此輩色目人中，實在阿刺伯人為最多。在文物制度上，元胡很重視回回文，甚至定為國子學，回回文，就是阿刺伯文。</p>
<p>最有趣的，是南宋史上泉州豪猾阿刺伯人蒲壽庚這個人所扮演的故事。蒲　庚以海上行商，仕宋做泉州提舉市舶。當時自明州起以迄廣州一帶的估舶，幾乎全在蒲壽庚一人敎制之下。南宋受元人壓迫，由臨安退溫州，再退福州，更由福州退泉州，依陸秀夫的計劃，就想利用海舶，來對抗元人，即以海軍為根據，樹立趙宋復興之基業。却不料，中途因為收取內河舶稅的問題，得罪了蒲壽庚。蒲壽庚就以海上勢力降元，替張弘範引路，並為元人建立了對付宋人海軍的大艦隊。所以我們不妨說，南宋之亡，是亡於阿刺伯人蒲壽庚之手內。</p>
<p>阿剌伯人自興起於麥加之後，凡自八世紀初以至十五世紀末，近八百年間包辦了歐亞通商的事業。而八世紀後半期，以報達為首都之阿拔期胡，最努力於海道東行，與中國通商。其路徑，自波斯灣經印度洋，過馬來半島，以至廣州，其後史至泉州，明州，揚州。阿刺伯人與中國通商，起自唐代，（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c23">十一·葉門素描　（二） <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>沙那在過去曾經頗繁榮過一陣子，為着與麥加互爭聖地，曾經亂哄哄鬧上一陣子，但最後失敗了。聖地依然在麥加，而沙那亦因此沒落下來了。在葡萄牙未曾發現菲洲航路以前，沙那是作為由印度去埃及之主要貿易中心，但海運一暢通，就沒人再來注意這高原上的城市了，這些年經着不斷的建設，沙那在市容上算是勉强恢復了一點，那白色的房舍與褐色之山腰相映成趣，一直到現在，阿刺伯之樂園這雅號仍舊給擱在牠頭上。在沙漢地區住久了的歐洲人，總喜歡來這兒銷磨些日子，實在說來，這兒的天氣很有點像意大利之地中海岸般的呢！</p>
<p>葉門之舊都是麥加，也就是咖啡之大量產地，位於紅海之東南，十八世紀時為葉門最大之都會，有人口五萬人，單說城墻就有三哩長。一七零八年法國人很想在這兒立立脚，但沒成功，莫加之主要之貿易是咖啡與香料，為南阿刺伯之主要輸出港，但自亞丁繁榮後，這兒就也像沙那似地從此一蹶不振。那些過去的繁華也就烟消雲散給人作為追憶之裁料了其實要說亞丁港，也就是地勢佔便宜，為軍事要衝，論貿易眞是微乎其微、然而憑着英國人之銳意建設，首先來往的大航船都停泊在那兒，大宗的煤之貿易也移過來了，從此麥加史反映着沒落下來。</p>
<p>紫門除了沙那麥加外，現今惟一的良港為荷台達（Hodeida）其他的大城尙有依布，ibb）達碼（Dhamar）都是揀有河流的地方建立而成的。這些城市也有廣大的橋園在建築的式樣上，一切還落後，可要是從自然風景來講，倒也都是極美的都市呢。</p>
<p>葉門的文化可以說是阿刺伯及埃及文化之合流，像這一帶地方，在古代都曾大大出過風頭，但現今一切都已過去，我們單看埃及同阿刺伯牠們這些年還不是走着倒運葉門又那能例外呢？這情形說起來也不僅葉門如此，整個的近東各國都被那倒退的潮流襲擊着。未來葉門之繁榮與共他近東各國也有着緊密不可分之連繫性。</p>

<p>「近東專輯」自五月廿七日開始登載，至今日吿多月一結束。在這一個中，歐陸戰局，急轉直下，果如專輯第一篇「開塲白」中所言：「德國為加强其對蘇攻勢起見，預料共必然在最近的　來，再在北菲里比亞方面，捲土重來，企圖襲擊埃及與蘇彝士運河。……」</p>
<p>沙那</p>
<p>沙那Sana城之四週，由磚石圍城，右面之營房，係由土耳其人人所建。城後之畢爾厄爾亞策布Bir-el-Azeb，為著名之別墅，景色淸幽，市民游　　　也。</p>
<p>戰局的推移，我們竟不幸而言中，此後中東近東整個局面的開展，固然在未定之天，然而我們編撰這一個專輯，也不是徒然的。近東專輯共十一篇，茲再刊布其次序如下：</p>

<p>夫造化自然，眞理無極，我人生息其問，充其知覺行為，取舍萬物，此果何為耶？曰：我人之為生也，為天演化生之一景，其能實現眞理，得其眞趣，成達牛活至於美善，此乃人生之光華；我人得此光華，而人事以興，文化日進。明哲者乃代有所生，有追慕先賢，而窮究自然，有闡明理性，而崇尙道德，有鍊達身心，而功在言行，有富足經騐，而增益智能，使人生益趨光大和樂，復以信仰所歸，期達郅治之域，此皆盡人事之極則。然時地有變易，人事有盛衰，人心物慾，消長其間，眞偽是非，相隨相生，有因智慮身修而得善有因迂腐積弊而生惡，終於治亂相尋，不可究詁，然則造化無窮之理，人事莫測之數，果非人智之所能及耶？於是有澈悟者，反求諸己，知有自我之存在，可參天地之化育，察芸芸其物之根，循綿綿其生之道，一貫心情，與之無間，以合乎一切自然法則，而成達自我之道。蓋我人所具之形神，非我人可得自私，人多為自私所蔽，故無由自明。是以自我之道，在求自明，非所調大我小我，乃自然所致，靈　相通，為至大至剛之生命潛力，存　其中，發之而成事物，而生光華。故人能澈悟於自我者，乃能確立人道至高絕對之信仰以赴之，乃能成達其為眞趣和樂之人世。</p>
<p>至夫萬物，皆有所立，皆有所達，人生之道，所立何在？所達何在？先聖哲之行仁義，要在以德愛人行其所宜，愼思明辨，致乎中席，矯時弊，維社會，期達相敬相愛，意出至誠，相親相扶，互濟其成，無所猜忌，無所怨尤，而歸大同樂善，此為人生無上之美德，應知發揚而光大之。茲披歷先代有幾多光華，照光及於我儕，我儕當知向其光明大道，勉力前行，倘若不此之由，不自取擇，不思進修，難免虛妄自是，或所行無道，至其極，勢必如江河日下，自陷昏沉，將如何挽救。是以處今之世，尤當奮發自勉，知所反求諸己，澈悟自我，行其素志，期達美善，為惟一歸趨</p>
<p>藝術為文化之實質，起於生趣之美，具有創造之機，在表達自我所感，求得眞趣所在也。一民族之興，由於眞精神與美意織之發展，其文物之興，即見其生趣意識之美，有生趣意識之美，乃得發榮滋長，其樂融融：反之，民族間如多見無文無質之虛浮生活，則無殊喪失其根株之樹，即枝　猶存，但無　有重生之望，遑論發榮滋長。是故求生之道，原在於愛，得　生趣，原在於美，表見其美，乃有藝術，有藝術而文物以成，人類內有文物而得繁榮悠久，和樂美善，所以欲求民族之興，必待人文興起，須得和樂　善可知矣。至於「愛」為生之仁核，一美為生之良果，善　為生之和樂，仟何學術思想，如宗敎，哲學，科學等，無不感動於美，濫觴於愛，而致於利生和樂。而藝術在本諸自我所感，成達其愛，表見其美而得乎眞趣之樂，</p>
<p>抑人之生趣，在所欲求，其求之於外，則唯物是取，求之於內，則唯心是尙，心通物用，乃得其樂。物為心障，則有何趣？人之心理，因時因地，因情因物，而各有所向，然其歸趨，皆好和樂美善。但人之生性，難於自率，有因放縱物慾，而予取予求，甚至忍心害理，無所不為，而人道以廢，有因積習旣深，而自墮心志　，隨波逐浪，茫茫不知所至，甚至惰性已成，不知自處，致形骸僅存，而生機已非，良可悲已！雖然，　之所極，必復共本，人人窮途，豈無反省，反省所悟，未有小思，所以善川其精神百　，奮發以進，而求達生活至於美善者矣。</p>

<h3 id="c40">黃宣平昨廣播　計口授糧計畫 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>工部局統制物價委員會委員黃宜平君、應工部局之請、於昨晚八時假座上海方向廣播雷台播音、對於計口授糧計劃有所說明、茲將其演詞錄後、</p>
<p>鄙人今晚承公共租界工部局之囑、用無綫雷向諸君講述該局分配米糧計劃、目的是要把分配計畫和辦法的若干點說明一下、這個計畫、現在雖然進行很順利、上海居民領得購米證的也巳經在百分之七十五以上、但是還有很多的居民、到現在還沒有領得購米證、而且對於這個計畫還有不明瞭的地方、鄙人現在把他分別說明、</p>
<p>諸君要知道、住在公共租界內的中國人、無論老幼男女、都有領得一紙購米證的權利、凡確是活着的人、便是剛纔出世一天的嬰孩、倘使由當地的保甲或本區的捕房證明確實有怎麼一個人、就可以領得一張購米證、</p>
<p>凡間接向工部局納稅的人們、一定要堅決地使住屋內直接繳納捐稅的人、代向工部局請領購米證、分給他們、替三房客請領購米證、是二房東的本分、每一個二房東都應該盡他的本分、他不可以不盡、也不可以向三房客索取任何交換條件、二房東若是不肯履行他的本分、三房客應該向本區捕房或保甲吿發、</p>
<p>現在已經確定、從本年七月六日起、工部局的米只能够憑購米證向零售米店買、</p>
<p>一家的人不必統統跑到米店去買米、一個人可以代表一家許多人、這樣一來、排隊軋米的情形可以避免、</p>
<p>你們也不必於每星期的頭一天、趕去米店買米、因為有一星期的時間給你、從七月六日起到十一日止的、星期內、無論那一天、你都可以憑購米證的第一號聯票、跑到票上寫明米店號數的那一家米店去買、工部局擔保你們一定可以買到你們一家所食的米、</p>
<p>納稅人諸君、若使因為一時不留心所以還不曾知道在什麼時候和到什麼地方、纔可以領到頭一批購米證的話、請你們於隨便那一天的下午三時至五時、隨帶本年六月季的房捐收據、到本膩的發米辦事處接洽、但是你們一定要在七月十日以前往那裹接洽、纔能够領到頭一星期所派的米、若使還有人不知道什麼地方去找發米辦事處的話、可以向各本區的保甲或隨便那一處發給購米證辦事處查問、</p>
<p>因為民衆謀便利、和使他們一家所用的米都能够拿到家裏起見、現在設有運米許可證的人、至多可以移運三斗的米、若使數量超過三斗、就非先向工部局米糧辦事處領得運米許可證、一概不准移運、</p>
<p>頭一星期所分派的米是在七月六日到十一日之間、憑購米證第一號聯票購買、數量是二升、其中白米一升半、碎米半升、價錢統共是新法幣五元、第二星期內是使用購米證第二聯票，除可以買米一升半以外、還可以買麵粉大約一斤半、等於一·六五磅、或·七五公斤、</p>
<p>公共租界內外僑居民、如具有中國人的用人、應該把房捐收據呈騐、向分發米糧辦事處替他們申請食米、發給食米辦事處的名單、巳經在本年六月二十四日各報發表過、</p>
<p>凡納稅人因為不能够把六月季的房捐收據呈騐、所以不能够領得購米證、請隨帶道一季本局所發收捐通知書、到捐稅股第五十四號辦公處接洽</p>
<p>關於分配米糧計晝、若使還有不明瞭的地方、請用書面向江西路　〇九號統制物價辦事處詢間、</p>

<h3 id="c43">赤脚與着襪  蔭子 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>六七年前，某君曾帶譏諷的口吻對某女士說：「現在的時勢眞是奇怪，女子的袖子自長袖子至中袖子，至短袖子，至凹袖子；褲子自長褲至短褲，至三角褲；襪子自畏統至短統，至赤脚；更加以鏤空皮鞋，並不以為敗風惡俗。男子却反密層層地全身裏住，在交際塲中不穿外套己欠禮貌，論若袒臂露腿，豈不視為大不敬麼？」常時素愛爭男女平等的某女士，竟噤口無言可答。最近某女士記起舊情，對某君說：「商業競爭，一經濟」之風盛行，有經濟小吃，一經濟」客飯，「經濟」旅館，「經濟」設備，「經濟」…，一般商人究竟是最會講究「經濟」的，為「經濟」手續，直　地就在原來價目邊加上ORB三字，眞是兩得其便。別的不說，單說現今的襪子，普通麻紗襪須十五六元儲幣，絲襪在二十元儲幣以上，即以短線襪而論，至少亦須五六元儲幣，安得不人人做赤脚大仙？」某君亦啞然。</p>
<p>近十數年來，大腿美的潮流一起，時髦女子爭相赤脚，脚趾上塗了鮮紅的蔻丹，脚踝骨上　一條精細的金鍊，累得幾個學究先生縐眉閉眼，幌着腦袋，畏嘆　世風日下，人心不古。自物價高漲以後，赤脚之多，賽過　舫之腿，人的觀念也大為之轉移，反對聲中多了一層原諒。</p>
<p>至於仍維持穿襪為原則的人呢，如果你脫下張三的鞋子一看，脚趾上是破洞，脚後跟也是破洞；脫去李四的鞋子一看，也全是破洞；祇耍襪統上不出毛病，將就得過去，這雙襪子的壽命，還能喘延若干天。人人抱着「天看見我着襪，地看見我赤脚。」的態度。這種着襪哲學，在現在時代實在是十分流行。我就是其中的一個。我究竟不是時髦女子，用不着炫耀我的腿美－其實，即使赤足，也並不怎樣美觀，旣無血樣的蔻丹，又無價昂的金鍊－更加受不了長輩譴責的目光，所以在寒冬時，固然是必定穿機，即在盛暑上街時，亦仍穿着統子很長的絲襪，不過我究竟是不合潮流了，路人反投了二道驚奇的眼光，似乎說這個女子倒不赤脚！</p>
<p>如果你是方惚過浴到公園裏去納凉，或是挾三二膩友傍晚時在幽靜的馬路上散步，赤脚是最凉爽舒暢的，但為了數千年來風俗·習慣·種種文化交織成的社會，令人可以舒暢的實在不多，拜客時如果可以照在家時一樣短衣短褲，該是多麼便利舒服，偏要穿着長衫，男的，必要時更要穿上馬掛，原有些拘謹虛套，可是你能不穿嗎？盛宴時撑着硬領的燕尾服，挺直着脖子活受罪幾小時，但是你還希望下次的宴會，你仍有這榮譽參加的資格。你肯蓬着頭黃着臉上公司買束西麼？所以在納凉時，散步時，自我的消遣中，正似在桎梏的虛隙夷偷取一些解放，而在拜客宴會時，赤脚實在是不登大雅，缺欠禮儀的惡習。有人也許責駡我未脫封建的餘毒，缺欠蓬勃的朝氣，不曾打破這桎梏的禮敎，求完全的解放，却似迂腐老朽一般。為何不實際地求生活上的舒適，却反被虛偽的禮儀所拘束？讓道世界解放了男女的身心，渲染了濃厚的Romantie的色彩。然而你看，事實上社會果眞是不需要禮儀為維持善良風俗，人類感情的準繩嗎？人與人之間的關係，可能回復到原始時代那麼的單純嗎？何况，在這茫茫的人世間，何處是一片安樂土？還說得上Romantie的色彩？</p>
<p>不過，最近赤脚已非單純的腿美問題了，腿不美的也要露醜了。豈眞是物價的高潮，使我必得放棄我的素養麼？還是仍抱着我的着襪哲學呢？也許等到物價狂潮再度猛漲時，也會把我捲入赤足的時代狂流中了！</p>
<h3 id="c44">市招漫談  勤孟 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>市招者，商店之招牌也。古今中外，市招以老為貴。北平有一爿店，歷史着實悠久，招牌是嚴嵩手筆，嚴嵩不是書家，他的人格亦不齒於衆口，該店所以保護唯恐或失者，亦倚老賣老之意耳。</p>
<p>記者會做過小小統計，大抵市招的命名，可分十類：其一，老閶開店先討吉利，如永盛，祥茂，恒泰，晋隆。其二，地名國名人名，容易使人記憶，如中山，華盛頓，巴黎，遠東，中英，蜀蓉。其三，自詡營業優點，使顧客嚮往，如雲飛，一樂也，津津，二我軒，潔而精。其四，老闆好名，把自己大名移作市招，如張小泉，冠生園，陳阿筱，馮存仁。其五，新名詞旣時髦一時，又流行於衆口，題作市招，可省宣傳之勞，如新生活，民生，大都會，三民，勝利，共和，大衆。其六，英美文字的音譯，或同時顧及意義，如米高美，夏令配克，派克，百樂門，亨達利。第七，古代或近代建築物而為一般人所熟悉的，如掃葉山房，梵王宮，杏花樓，頤和園。第八，以招徠口吻題作市招，如試試看，好吃來。第九，以營業範圍標於市招，以銀行業為多，如堅業，農民，殖邊，漁業，交通。第十，故作驚人之筆，藉以吸引顧客，如神仙世界，快活林，上天，樓外樓。市招萬萬千千，命名的方法，自然不止這些，此僅就下筆之際，一時想着的略舉其例耳。</p>
<p>上海市招的書寫，除美術體外，幾乎由幾個人包辦着，十年前，唐駝大紅，十塊市招至少三塊是他寫的，潤筆年獲兩萬金，且有由偶像而趨於迷信之勢。當時傳說，開店苟非請唐某寫招牌，三年之內關門可必。唐駝死後，譚澤關崛起，五六年來，就數量及收入而言，已打破唐駝記錄。其次王紹羲，次于右任，次章雋，此外黃葆戊，馬公愚所書亦多。</p>
<p>市招命名之怪，無過於八九年前，開設於五馬路（記得是中央大旅社附近）的勃郞林食品公司。命名的人大約是瘋子，否則其心可誅！按勃郞林即手槍，顧客光臨該店，豈非自認吃衛生丸的殺坯。此店不關，是無天理－結果，不到一年，長期打烊矣。</p>
<p>八一三前，先施公司本有一橫式市招，沿南京路直展至浙江路，寫着「先施公司統辦環球貨品，中華國產，南北海味，中西器皿，關東人參……」，計長三十餘丈，把它賢起，高度可與國際大飯店並肩，其長大當推全市第一。「八·一三」戰役，該公司中一巨彈，後來重修門面，遂不復見。</p>
<p>市招的向積，一般都以門面大小為比例，但是也有例外的，跑馬廳畔國際大飯店，建築雄偉，不僅上海第一，抑係遠東第一。但其市招之小，令人難以置信，「國際大飯店」五個克羅咪字，貼在入口處門楣上，大小僅與兒童方塊字彷彿耳。</p>
<p>醬園店輒將醫園二字，特別放大，每不明其用意所在，字體之大，足以駭人，筆畫的直徑有大至二尺的，整個字的面積，常有四五丈見方。某算學家說，普通目力，只要視錢無阻礙，雖距離一萬九千密達，猶可淸晰可辨。亡友鄭正秋，目光近視，冠於一時，生前嘗偕之散步愛文義路，因未戴眼鏡，記者指着馬路對面的醬園二字給他認，竟答不見。可憐亦復可笑。</p>

<p>市招命名新穎別緻的，舉二例如下：南京路某眼鏡公司，市招為「OIC」，諧音oh！I　See！一意即啊！我看淸了！鄭正秋之流見之，有不被其吸引而破鈔者乎？泥城橋一浴室名「大觀園」，園中裸體如林，人魚滿池，大觀二字，允稱貼切。　旅館亦如律師，往往不大而大，自承小旅館者有二家，一在北四川路橫浜橋附近，名已遺忘，一在敏體尼蔭路南陽橋，曰東南小旅社。　市招命名能雅固佳，惟亦不宜過於冷癖，有題飲食店日一者者居者，人莫之解。問之，則取論語：近者悅，遠者來也。叉吾邑宜興北大街，有裱畫店曰「特健藥齋」，為邑中某名士所題，非無出典，特太雅耳！初開張時，誤會者極多，記者童年，亦嘗上門購取六味地黃丸，店主以為有意搗蛋，余亦為正名而力爭，幾演三本鐵公鷄，殊可哂也！（完）</p>

<p>— 譚影</p>
<p>今後靑年學業問題的嚴重，由於新聞界的首先公開討論，　引起了社會各方面深切地注意。每天的報紙上，總有幾篇靑年學生，尤其是本屆的畢業生，向社會呼籲的文字儘管他們都在喊着。「什麼是我們的出路？　現社會所能給與他們的，只有空虛的同情，而無滿意的答覆。雖然，我個人對於這個問題還沒有切身的關係，但去年今日，我也是陷於同樣的苦悶之中，現在雖已僥倖地獲得一個求學的機會，又何敢稍存「隔岸觀火」的心情？我願以這一年來就學的經過，提供作本屆中學畢業生的參考</p>
<p>記得是去年的六月中旬，畢業考試考過了，同學們都在興高彩烈地大談其出路問題，有的預備繼續升學，有的已謀好了相當的職務。當他們徵詢到我的計劃時，我一字也回答不出，　能報之以苦笑。的確，在那時對於這兩點都沒有一些把握；去年的生活指數雖較今年為低，但照我的家境，還是不能供給我讀書費用，就業吧，則感釗旣無能力，又無人力。在這樣的情形下，苦悶司調達於極點，雖則苦悶，但我毫不失望，存在於我的內心，一直有着這樣的一個堅强的信念：只要我努力向前去追求，前面就決不是懸崖絕壁，一定有一條司走的路。於是我一面寫了許多的信給我的親戚故交們，請他們在可能範圍內，予我以幫助，一面每天在翻報紙，想在上面尋得一個機會。終於有一天我得到兩個可喜的消息。</p>
<p>有　位老先生—我的親戚—願意供給我的求學費用，我因為不願無故接受下這樣一個大的幫助，便婉然地謝絕，最後，他懇切地同我說：「我知道靑年們都不甚願意接受人家的幫助，現在讓我們擬定一個辦法，算是我借錢給你求學，等你能自立了再歸還我，借錢　書的例子很多，並不是　恥的，你得知道我願幫助你，並不是特別示惠與你，而是盡我為國家社會所應盡的義務，所以我希望你將來也能以你的力量去幫助別的淸寒學生就行了。」雖然我終於因獲得了別的機會而未接受他的幫助，但這種仁義可風的美意，却深深地感動了我，希望社會上有錢的人們，都能效法這位老先生</p>
<p>第二件可喜的事是報紙上登着一家工業學校免費供給膳宿的招生廣吿，在我，期認為比前者尤為興奮，可是為了立定自己的脚步，乃不得不各方而調查它的背景，後經某報代為查覆，原來是幾家工廠為要造就專門人才而設，宗旨很為純正。於是我就去報名應試了，出乎意料之外，雖招收二十人之多，而投考的却僅二百人，—我想，或者有一部份人因不明情形，而不收去考吧！所以幸運得很，竟也錄取了。因為我們要在兩年中讀完四年的課程，一星期須上三四十小時課，由於生活的安定和缺少外界的誘惑，我們也不覺得過分吃力。很快的一年過去了，雖然環境會時常變遷，沒有人能擔保此後的一兩年也能安然渡過，但過去的一年我能獲得求學的機會，却是値得自慰的！</p>
<p>魯迅先生說過：一什麼是路？路是從荊棘中開闢出來的。」由於這次的遭遇，我更信它的眞確。朋友們，不要為了前途的阻礙而灰心，堅定自已的信念，用自己的努力去拓屐前途，不要讓時光在苦悶中溜去！</p>
<p>機會不會在前面等待你，却要你自已去追求。</p>
<h3 id="c66">夏令三浴 <a href="#c66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— 若賢</p>
<p>所謂夏令三浴者，即日光浴冷水浴，與腸胃浴是也。前二者為我人所熟知者，而後者常不為一般人所注意。若我人常常使行此三種浴，不但疾病與我人無緣，即是患有胃腸病，皮膚　者，往柱能收不藥而治效。故夏令乃我人　一改進健康的一個好季節，切莫讓他輕輕的逃過才是。今把此三種浴略加說明於下。</p>
<p>日光浴</p>
<p>在夏季行日光浴，效力最大目極為便利。夏天我人衣服單，與日光接觸的機會最多。直接　增强我人皮膚的抵抗力，間接可增進血球數量和血液循環。且因日光中紫外綫的作用，能殺滅皮膚病中的細菌，常作為皮膚病自療之一法。在夏季使用日光浴，時間不宜過長，十分鐘至一刻鐘巳足够，更切忌中午日光最烈時舉行，否則常發生皮膚晒焦。頭昏。目眩等現象。行使時身體時常轉動，使全身都有受到日光的機會。頭部須有物遮蓋，且能戴上一副黑色眼鏡最佳，以免有上述之現象的發生。使行地點室外室內均可，在室內舉行時，須注意　窗，因普通玻璃不能通過日光中的紫外綫的緣故。</p>
<p>冷水浴</p>
<p>不論冷水浴如何使行法，其最重的一個步序，必須摩擦。因為冷水浴後，能使體溫降低，並且發生毛孔收縮等現象。所以必須全身摩擦至覺得溫熱為止。冷水浴在夏天尤為我人所歡迎，浴後凉快異常，淸醒神志，且能增這身體各部器官工作的效能。</p>
<p>腸胃浴</p>
<p>所謂腸胃浴者，即絕食一餐而代以相當量之水或其他流質食物之謂也。可使胄腸得到一個充分休息時間，增進消化與吸收能力，胃腸病亦無從發生。因為胃腸等病，常在食得過飽所致；胃部既無充分之消化力，往往發生一種毒質餘留在體內，因而致胃腸中毒，即我人所謂自毒（Auto-intoxicatyon）是也。此法雖不日日行之，每週數次已可，不論早晚皆宜。惟實行時多飮流質食品，因我人數日不進餐不會餓死，而不能數日無水而生。</p>
<h3 id="c67">皮鞋與西裝 <a href="#c67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— 納罕</p>
<p>天地良心說一句，皮鞋是便宜下來了。起因當然是法工部局的一紙皇皇處罰佈吿，一條霞飛路，從華龍路到金神父路一段，走不七三九家就有一家罰令停業X大的佈吿黏姑在玻璃窗上，據一家受罰的皮鞋店主語人：被罰　巴自動　定價打了一個七折，目前櫉窗裏三百元以上的皮鞋已吿絕跡，大致是動於二百元左右，一般祇見價目單直綫向上而五年來絕　回頭　的朋友覺得他的「視覺」已舒服了許多。</p>
<p>受罰的店家，一致强辯為原料來自黑市，然當局已將此項理由駁斥了，同時更抄查了專做投機黑市的電話二十餘家，予以然　，惟其店家將黑市　來愈抬高了，（當然有大半店家本身早囤了若干原料而惟恐天下不亂。）生活程度高漲，於是一無止境，這一次皮鞋店關刀，雖則二百元CRB在中等階級還是可望而不可接，可是比之半月前的三百元巳覺看看俗倒還嘸啥」了！</p>
<p>為着研究市情，不，算是打聽市面價目吧，偶然走進一家西服店問料子，一問之下，每碼二白元以下的貨色據說全是「落擋貨」，亦即所謂少有人顧問的繁脚貨是也。有一塊料子的價目是每碼六百二十元，打七折，實價每碼四百二十四元，身西裝二碼七五計算，加上做」共計一千三百六十六元CRB，（據說二百元做工還是用的起碼襯料。）王家沙有一家櫉窗裏的一身西裝看看嘸啥，一問價鈿是二千元。據某一家店家的學徒懇切表示：「斯鮑坦克司」，棋盤街已不出樣版，價鈿是有，出六千元CRB可以買到，上次看到王家沙那一身還嘸啥的西裝，證實下來已非　斯鮑坦克司一無疑</p>
<p>市價飛漲，皮鞋店下來讓還西服店最厲害，同時尙未聞有賞罰如皮鞋店那樣痛快的情爭，呢絨自改為CRB計算起無日不在看漲中，遑論按照　月　十六至二十八日之對折及六六計算，恐怕不行亦且三級跳了，眞是「窮人褲子二爿洞，換季日子何時來。」</p>
<h3 id="c68">鈔票頌 <a href="#c68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— 渭祥</p>
<p>此次管氏假八仙橋靑年會舉行「歷代鈔票展覽會」，往觀者極衆。偶憶俞申五先生所作鈔票頌，極有意義，茲錄之如次：一鈔票鈔票，木是　遣，不耐火燃，不堪水漂。銀行是牠的監牢，基金是牠的倚靠不論柴米油，無拘衣履帽，有牠來都辦到，無牠時使不妙。親朋每為牠參商，去婦總因牠吵鬧。牠眞是刁鑽古怪惡魔王，人人為牠情顚倒，怎怪牠劣小子苦逢迎，厚顔不顧人護誚。闊大少擺威風，祇嚷着滿不在乎，兄弟有的是現鈔。」</p>
<h3 id="c69">風雨同舟 <a href="#c69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>六　一彈指</p>
<p>城從廂屋裏踱到堂屋裏，陳老太太從後邊廚房裏出來，笑道：一葉少爺，你隨便走走，我們家裏，不能像府上的房子，又寬大，父整齊，芳官回來給我說過的。因為我們先前也不是　橋人，這房子是現成買的。我看我兒子，他是不要住這裹，我的孫子孫女兒，越發不會要住這裏。將來我老婆子伸了腿，只有關起來。維城道：一這房子也不錯，又緊峭，又古雅，他們兄妹回來，就住東邊幾間嗎？陳老太太一指道：一是東邊兩間，兄妹倆一人一間陳老太太開了從堂屋裏通過去的腰門，維城笑道：一鏡台上，有着花露水瓶，粉盒粉缸，遭大概是國芳妹妹的房了。一陳老太太道：一是的。芳官也會淘氣，去年暑假回來，鄉裏總是鄕裏的景緻，到了晚上自然有蚊子，家裹可只一頂透凉紗帳午，他們兄妹倆便爭起來，器官要，芳官也要。我說什麼　都該做妹妹的讓哥哥。葉少爺，你道她怎麼說，她說，現在是男女平權。」維城站在國芳和國器的房的中間，兩邊看了看，笑道：一太伯母我猜結果是國芳妹妹勝利的。我可惜沒這樣一個妹妹，有這樣一個妹妹，我也是願意讓她勝利。但是太伯母疼孫女兒，也勝過疼孫子的，是不是？</p>
<p>維城的活，漸漸的脫離了客氣，而陳老太太也給他說的滿懷高興。一會兒走到廚房裏去，看看臘肉爛了沒有，一會兒又來和維城談話。維城遵命把大褂脫了，聞到飄拂過來的一陣肉香，就說「太伯母，你只當我是你的孫子，別當是一位客人，有一樣兩樣菜够了，不必多費事。陳老太太笑道：我沒這福分把葉少爺當做孫子，便是當做孫子，我是疼孫子孫女兒的，他們回來了，也得請他們吃一個痛快。」維城笑了。　（一二一）</p>

<p>— 新夢</p>
<p>自己對於別種運動都提不起興趣，然而對游泳却相當的愛好。往年一到暑天，百忙中總得抽些閒去練習游泳。在這暑假的前夕，游泳季又照例的展開了，使我不自覺的回味到往年和友好練習游泳的樂趣。市游泳，虹口游泳池，乃至海濱浴塲，又都像浮現在我的眼簾之前，好比身臨其境的樣子。然而戰事之後，他阻止了人間的一切，使我們和這幾個游泳池也隔絕了四五個年頭啦。</p>
<p>也許有人會說你要游泳，公共租界，法租界，每年還不是有幾個游泳池開放嗎？不錯，然而這些都是營業性質的游泳池，門票相當貴，休息時間，僕歐便會向你兜賣食品，好像不吃一些東西，是不配進這種游泳池的。尤其是今年，游泳池的門票要中儲券四五元，你想薪資階級的我們，够資格常到這些地方央游泳嗎？因此，我也就整整的五個年頭不進游泳池了。</p>
<p>最近，在報紙上發現了青年會體育部的中青游泳團在招收團員，便去要了一份章程，逐條看過之後，覺得的確非常經濟，因此，我很想為愛好游泳的朋友作一介紹。中靑游泳在四川路中國靑年會老會所，建在室內的，這游泳池目建成以來，年數已相當遙遠。</p>
<p>這次靑年會體育部主辦的中靑游泳團，日期自七月一日至八月三十一日，適足兩個月。靑年會方面，所以主辦這游泳團，宗旨在聯合高級游泳　　，作有組織的游泳訓練，以提高游泳水準和興趣。不過加人為團員的，事前須經醫師的檢騐體格，患傳染病和心臟病的人　謝絕參加的。能够游自由式，蛙式，側式，仰臥式等一，可達二十碼遠，而會潛水跳水的，都可參加。</p>
<p>在兩個月的訓練期內，包括高級水上安全技能和游藝，各項游泳比賽訓練，初步拯溺術，各種花式跳水、各項游泳成績測騐等科目。訓練時間在每星期二，四，六晚間七時至九時。關於費用，少年會友和學生游泳班友五元，成人會友十兀，非會友十五元，道是作為貼補水　費的。</p>
<p>不過，加入中靑游泳團的費用果然是經濟，關於資格的限制，未免太嚴格。能够游泳各式的泳而會潛水，跳水當，究竟不多，這樣就祇限高級的游泳人才入會，而一般初習游泳或已會初步的就不能加入。所以我很望中靑游泳團除招收高級團員之外，對於初級也能另外招收，使不會或少會游泳的人，也能入團受訓，才符合了提倡游泳的本旨。</p>
<h3 id="c71">「惻隱之心」 <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— 匍匐</p>
<p>是商店打烊的時候了，司開　上鐵門，凑巧，把一隻花貓軋在上面了，牠掙扎着，哀號着，那副樣子是够可憐的，於是一店人的注意力都被吸引過去了，七嘴八舌的生張牧法營救。結果是—經理出來了，他馬上吩咐司閣的拿長梯子去把牠救下來，可見「惻隱之心」，是「人皆有之」的。</p>
<p>然而有人在竊竊私語了：認為經理對於貓的關心超過了一店的同事。目前生活程度像漸漸的紙　，而津貼問題却還沒有合理的解決，雖只同事們也上過「陳情表」，擺出一副可憐相來，以冀引起在上者的一惻隱之心」，可是結果竟沒有貓的幸運！於是牢騷來了：人不如貓！</p>
<p>其實，這　問題已經是老調了，速在兩千年前，我們的孟老夫子就在一位國君面前提出過…</p>
<p>「今恩足以及禽獄而功不至於百姓者，獨何歟？」</p>
<p>我記不起那位國君怎樣回答，我也不知道這位經理如何置辯，但祇要你能够冷靜的想一想，這獨何歟」，是不難加以解釋的。那就是人與人之間有利害關係在內，而禽獸則根本不同了。這就是中國所以有護牲協會的組織而職工的保障則仍付缺如的原故。講人道的人們看見小販倒提着鷄鴨過市，就會發「虐待」，而對自己屬下的職工要求改善待遇，却是「置若罔聞」，是並不矛盾的，因為「人之道一，是一損不足以奉有餘」，講人道的人們，是「人」，也就雖怪其然了。</p>
<p>然而因吐怠工等事情又時有所聞了，幸　很快就得到解決。但這也不能說是犯上」，因為「天之道」，原是一損有餘以補不足」，而況這有餘有職工的汗血在內。</p>
<p>在目前，勞資關係是應該建業在「同舟共濟」上的，這意義又還在「惻隱之心」以上了，而人貓的不同也就在這　。</p>

<h3 id="e2">Prime Minister Tojo's Statement <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, June 6th, Domei News Agency Dispatch: Prime Minister Tojo issued a statement commemorating the 5th anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Incident, stating roughly: "In the past, Japan has consistently adopted a peaceful policy towards the Chongqing regime in order to achieve a satisfactory resolution. However, they misjudged our strength, leading to the escalation of the incident under the assistance of British and American schemers. After Mr. Wang Jingwei broke away from Chongqing and devoted himself to peace, the construction of peaceful areas in China has also steadily progressed under the cooperation of Japan. The United Kingdom and the United States, attempting to dominate East Asia, have continued to aid Chongqing, and have surrounded our empire, threatening our survival. This is why we were forced to declare war on the United Kingdom and the United States last winter. The Imperial Army and Navy are brave and invincible, and the bases of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands in East Asia have been completely destroyed. The supply routes to Chongqing have also been completely cut off. From the July 7th Incident through the Greater East Asia War to the present day, not only has the construction of Greater East Asia steadily progressed, but also a foundation for certain victory has been established. We hold absolute initiative in various parts of East Asia. At the same time, the National Government of China has clearly indicated its close cooperation with us. The Imperial Government has repeatedly stated in the past that assisting the development of the National Government is a fundamental policy, and our determination to cooperate with China, Manchuria, and Thailand to build a new order in Greater East Asia will not be changed in the slightest."</p>
<h3 id="e3">President Wang's Reflections <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>President Wang issued a commemorative article, stating roughly: "More than half a year has passed since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, and a comprehensive peace has not yet been realized. This is truly a heartbreaking matter. Before the Greater East Asia War, Japan had already explained the significance of building a new order in East Asia, in preventing the spread of communism and eliminating Anglo-American economic aggression. After the Greater East Asia War, these theories have become a reality. The entire East Asia, the National Government, and the Manchurian State have cooperated with Japan. Thailand has fought alongside Japan. The rest, from the Philippines eastward, including British and Dutch territories, to various ethnic groups in Burma in the west, are eager to break away from the shackles of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands. The movement for Indian independence is gaining momentum. The Japanese government has already stated its support for Indian independence. It can be seen that the entire East Asia is united in objective and in fact, with the common goal of completing the Greater East Asia War and building Greater East Asia. On the occasion of the 5th anniversary of the July 7th Incident, I would like to solemnly propose the following points: First, we should restart psychological construction, recognize the legacy of Pan-Asianism, work together with one heart and one mind, and cooperate in the Greater East Asia War, which is the practice of Pan-Asianism. Second, we should know that the so-called cooperation in the Greater East Asia War is not empty talk, but must be put into practice. We should contribute our mental and material strength to the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, we should strive to implement planned production policies in agriculture and commerce, so that our national strength and people's strength will increase day by day. If so, the Greater East Asia War will be more smoothly carried out with our cooperation, and our country and nation will be liberated as a result of the victory of the Greater East Asia War. Third, we should know that to achieve comprehensive peace and cooperate in the Greater East Asia War, it is essential that we communicate with those in Chongqing who are inclined to peace, relieve their pain of suppression and restraint, and encourage them to actively participate in the peace camp, concentrating the nation's mental and material strength to engage in the practice of Pan-Asianism. On December 29th of the 27th year [1938], the bombshell I dropped, if the Chongqing side could have received it, then when the European War broke out in early September of the 28th year [1939], China and Japan would have been able to deal with world events in the same stride. Japan would have achieved smooth development, and China would have had the opportunity to recover its vitality and seek further progress. Why has it been delayed until now? If we continue to delay, I am afraid there will be no hope of recovery. I hope that the Chongqing side will quickly reflect on this critical moment."</p>
<h3 id="e4">Commander-in-Chief Hata's Statement <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, June 6th, Domei News Agency Dispatch: July 7th is the 5th anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Incident. General Shunroku Hata, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Army in China, issued a statement, roughly saying: "Looking back at the Sino-Japanese Incident since its occurrence, the strategy has gone through three stages. First, from the beginning of the war to the capture of Nanjing. Second, from the fall of Nanjing to the capture of the three towns of Wuhan. Third, from the occupation of the three towns of Wuhan to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. The stationed army, while fighting, has also strived to ensure the security of the occupied areas, and has promoted construction work in political and economic terms. That is, in political construction, in accordance with the major policy of dealing with the incident, we have worked to strengthen the National Government. In economic construction, China and Japan have cooperated. Now, the stationed army has entered the stage of final decisive battle with the Chongqing faction. That is, recently, the Japanese army has carried out operations to attack the Communist army in North China, implemented the Zhejiang-Jiangxi operation in Central China, and launched offensives in South China, expanding the war results in various places. I hereby reiterate our determination. The Japanese Army stationed in China is determined to make every effort with a spirit of perseverance, and move towards the completion of the operational objectives."</p>

<p>From our military correspondent in Jiangxi, June 6th, Domei News Agency Dispatch: Elite Japanese troops, determined to attack the 20,000-strong 58th Army stationed in the southern boundary of the triangular zone, have arrived this morning at a location 35 kilometers northeast of Zhangshu Town and southwest of Fengcheng. They are currently fiercely attacking the newly formed 1st Division and the 10th Division of that army. According to reports, the Japanese army attacked the 58th Army yesterday morning and is now jointly attacking with other Japanese troops advancing westward from the Chongren area.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Indian Liberal Party Leader Issues Statement <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, June 6th, Domei News Agency Dispatch: Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, leader of the Indian Liberal Party, declared yesterday that although the Executive Council of the Governor-General has been expanded and the number of Indian members has increased to ten, its political power and organization have not actually changed. The control of the British Cabinet's India Office over the Council is the most powerful. Whether in India any party or faction doesn't see the current British Secretary of State for India, Amery, as the most untrustworthy person in the British Empire. As for British Minister Cripps' repeated telegrams stating that he is eager to obtain the consent of the Indian National Congress and the All-India Muslim League, this is sufficient to alienate the various parties and factions in India.</p>

<p>Hankou, June 5th, Domei News Agency Dispatch: On the morning of the 3rd, the Japanese army attacked approximately 15,000 soldiers from the 15th Brigade of the New Fourth Army near Xiyebei (approximately 28 kilometers south of Yingcheng) and completely occupied Xiyebei, where its headquarters was located, on the morning of the 4th. They are continuing to attack the surrounding areas.</p>
<h3 id="e8">United States Republican Party Changes Direction <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>New York, June 5th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: The Public Opinion Research Institute recently surveyed Republican Party members on the question of whether the United States should actively participate in any post-war international organization. Among them, those who indicated they should participate accounted for 77% of the total, an increase of 40% compared to the same survey conducted by the institute five years ago. When the League of Nations was established in 1920, the Republican Party was the one who opposed U.S. participation. From the above survey, it can be seen that the Republican Party has now changed its direction.</p>

<p>Vichy, June 6th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: French Minister of Agriculture, Mr. Le Roy Ladurie, gave a radio speech today, appealing to French farmers to work hard to harvest so that there is no shortage of food for the people. According to the latest statistics, this year's wheat harvest faces many difficulties and it will be impossible to supply sufficient food. However, the people have always trusted the farmers, knowing that no matter what the statistics show, French farmers will not allow their compatriots to starve.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Fierce Fighting on the Central Soviet Front; German Forces are Seeking to Open a Path to Attack the Caucasus to the South <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>German Supreme Headquarters, June 6th, Huitong News Agency Dispatch: This afternoon's German war report stated that the military operations in the southern sector of Eastern Europe are proceeding according to plan. The enemy's strong forces trapped west of the Don River are being annihilated. Attempts by Soviet infantry and tank units to launch rescue attacks have been ineffective. German aircraft assisted the army in combat, fiercely bombing the enemy's supply transportation and railways. North of Voronezh, enemy's strong forces launched an attack, but were repelled despite the assistance of enemy aircraft and tanks. Many enemy tanks were destroyed. The battle continues. As a result of yesterday's air combat in Eastern Europe, 127 enemy aircraft were shot down, while we lost only 3 aircraft.</p>
<p>Xiongcheng, June 6th, Domei News Agency Dispatch: Under a strong offensive, German forces have crossed the upper reaches of the Don River and are advancing toward Voronezh on the Moscow-Rostov railway line. Progress has been made after five days of attacks. According to reports, General Timoshenko's Soviet forces are in danger of being cut off from the northern Soviet forces. The situation of the Soviet forces defending the Don River front is now very dangerous and must be avoided immediately. There is no detailed report on the progress of the German forces after crossing the Don River. The counterattacks of Soviet tanks and artillery have not been able to stop the advance of German tanks. A German communiqué stated that a large number of Soviet troops have been surrounded in the Kursk and Belgorod areas. London does not deny the seriousness of the situation of the Soviet troops in that area. The German army has broken through several points on the 150-mile long front from Kursk to Kupiansk. The pressure from the German army has not diminished in the past 24 hours. Today, the Soviet noon supplementary communiqué stated that in the Belgorod area, the German army had made a wedge-shaped incursion. Last night, the Moscow war report also acknowledged that General Bock's troops attacking in the Kursk area totaled 11 divisions: 5 infantry divisions, 4 tank divisions, and 2 motorized divisions. North of Kalinin, northwest of Moscow, fighting has continued since Friday. There is still no detailed war report.</p>
<p>Berlin, June 6th, Domei News Agency Dispatch: The German High Command announced last night that the pincer offensive by German forces in the Kursk and Kharkov areas after the general German offensive in central Soviet Union had made contact. Several Red Army units were annihilated, with many prisoners and war trophies seized. The Red Army's counterattacks with tanks and artillery were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Moscow, June 5th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: The Soviet official communiqué stated that Soviet troops on the Kursk front engaged in combat with German infantry and tank units. Fierce fighting is also taking place on the Belgorod and Volchansk fronts. There is nothing to report on other fronts. In addition, the Red Army newspaper "Red Star" published supplementary news stating that on the Kursk front, the German army attacked our positions with five infantry divisions, four tank divisions, and two motorized infantry divisions. Fierce fighting is in progress. German tank units have broken into our defense lines in several places. However, our troops on the northern route defeated two German regiments and recovered four villages and towns. On the Belgorod front, although the enemy fiercely attacked our troops, our positions remained unmoved. The Volchansk district front, which had been quiet for a while, is now being attacked by the German army again. In this short, narrow front, the German army used no fewer than 200 tanks. Last night, the German army broke through several gaps in our positions, but after our fierce counterattacks, the German army failed to penetrate further.</p>
<p>Capital of Switzerland, June 5th, Domei News Agency Dispatch: According to a German announcement, the Crimean Peninsula (including Kerch and Chersonesus) is now completely in German hands. The implication is that the remnants of the Soviet army that withdrew from the fortress of Sevastopol have been cleared.</p>
<p>German Strategy</p>
<p>Capital of Sweden, June 5th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: According to military observers in neutral countries here, the German summer offensive on the Eastern Front, which has been long advertised, has now been launched. The German authorities will spare no effort to achieve their offensive objectives in the shortest possible time. The German strategy is to take encirclement actions in the Kursk and Belgorod areas, with the aim of meeting in Voronezh. The Soviet side has admitted to retreating east in the Konlsk and Belgorod areas, but neither the German nor the Soviet side has stated to what extent. According to last night's news, the advance units of the German left wing have crossed the Don River and have already crossed the river near Voronezh. At the same time, its right-wing armored units have also reached the left bank of the Oskol River, which is between the cities of Stary Oskol and Valuyki. The Soviet troops in the Kursk area are in danger of being surrounded first. According to German military circles, the operational objective of the German troops in that area is not to occupy land, but to eliminate the Red Army. The German army has deployed many aircraft and tanks in this operation. The Soviet side admitted yesterday that the number of German tanks exceeded 2,000. However, the current tank battle seems to be only a prelude to a large-scale infantry battle. It is generally believed that the German army will head south as soon as it conquers Voronezh, going straight to the lower reaches of the Volga River, so as to open a path to attack the Caucasus. As for other areas, they will not be safe and sound. Fighting has already started in the Katsk district, 100 miles west of Moscow. Northwest of Moscow, in the Kalinin area, the Soviet side has admitted that the defense line has been broken through. The German army lost 27 tanks. The situation in the Leningrad area has also become slightly tense in recent days. German long-range artillery is fiercely bombarding the outskirts of the city and the port of Kronstadt. The Soviet side has also prepared to deal with a frontal attack by the German army. A steady stream of reinforcements is being transported to Leningrad daily via Lake Ladoga. These troop transport ships also carry women and children from the endangered city on their return journey.</p>
<p>Eastern Front Situation</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet border, June 5th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: It has been learned that the German High Command on the Eastern Front is currently working to cut off the rear transportation of the Soviet forces in the Donets and Don River areas. According to military experts, the situation on the Eastern Front is roughly as follows: The German offensive is not limited to the Kursk to Kharkov front; almost all areas in the middle route are included, especially Belgorod. The German army has a wide foothold in the upper reaches of the Don River, forming a protruding position. If the German army can hold it for a long time, the line of General Timoshenko's troops is in danger of being cut off. The German army's immediate goal is obviously to occupy the city of Voronezh (in the upper reaches of the Don River). The Soviet army has set up defenses along the Oskol River, resolutely resisting. The city of Valuyki has been occupied by the German army, so they had to retreat. However, the Soviet positions in the middle of the Oskol River remain intact. The Soviet troops in Belgorod are still maintaining contact with the Soviet troops in Kursk. As of now, it is not yet clear what the exact positions of the German army are in the Don River basin. It is approximately in the area north of Ostrogozhsk. According to informal German sources, the German army has crossed the Don River in two locations, somewhere south of Voronezh. Unless the Soviet army can counterattack as quickly as possible, the water transportation between General Timoshenko's troops and the Caucasus will be blocked. According to front-line news, the Red Army's resistance is extremely fierce. In short, the German strategy this time will be the same as the last offensive on the Donets River. That is, once the German army has a strong bridgehead on the Donets, the Soviet line will be in chaos.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Berlin Officially Announces the Scope of German Aircraft Activity <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, June 5th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: The authorities announced that the weather was clear yesterday, and the scope of German aircraft activity was extremely active, from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Red Sea in the south. A convoy heading east was discovered between North Cape and Spitsbergen. German dive bombers immediately attacked it, sinking four freighters, approximately 24,000 tons, and scattering another eleven. Our enemy also engaged in aerial combat with enemy aircraft at that location, shooting down four enemy aircraft. The Murmansk city area and port were also bombed, and a 6,000-ton freighter was severely damaged. On the northern route of the Eastern Front, German aircraft concentrated on destroying the enemy's transportation lines. Enemy motorized units and supply trains reinforcing the front line were annihilated. Enemy warehouses and artillery positions in the Ilmen district were also bombed. The ability of German infantry to advance to the Don River area between Moscow, Kursk, and Kharkov also benefited from the air force's assistance. The ports on the eastern coast of the Black Sea were also attacked, and two freighters were heavily damaged. Fires broke out in several ports. In the above battles, we shot down a total of 57 Red Army aircraft, and four German aircraft went missing. In North Africa, the German and Italian air forces jointly attacked enemy airfields, shooting down 19 British aircraft. The air battle was most intense around the El Guetar base and the Suez Canal area. The Guetar railway station and airport were completely destroyed. German and Italian aircraft also attacked Malta, encountering fierce resistance. A total of 14 British aircraft were shot down.</p>

<p>Reuters dispatch from Bear City, 6th: In the northern sector of the Egyptian theater, General Leese's troops have achieved some local advances. Meanwhile, British counterattacks in other areas have been repelled by the Axis forces. Although the British have made every effort to advance, the Axis forces stand firm. British reports state that they are continuing to attack Rommel's troops, but make no mention of any victories, and admit that the Axis forces have not suffered significant losses. Yesterday's reports stated that German tanks and infantry had broken into the center of the battle zone, and fierce fighting is underway. A Cairo communiqué stated that fierce fighting continued throughout the day yesterday in the Al Alamein area. In one area, the British forces launched an attack in the evening. The communiqué also stated that in one air battle, the British lost six aircraft.</p>
<p>Havas dispatch from an Egyptian border region, 5th: The great battle in the Al Alamein area has lasted for five days. The positions of the two sides appear to be unchanged. Although there have been some breakthroughs along the line from the coast to the Qattara Depression, the entire front line is still held by the British forces and remains firm. For the past two days, the troops of General Auchinleck, Commander-in-Chief of the British Middle East Forces, have launched counterattacks, even pushing the German-Italian forces slightly westward. The two sides are now fighting fiercely on the scorching sand dunes (the recent heat in Shanghai is, of course, far less severe than in the desert). The center of the fighting appears to be in the so-called "bottleneck area" between Al Alamein and Qattara. Yesterday morning, German Commander-in-Chief General Rommel launched an offensive in that area, deploying all of his armored units. This strategy was clearly anticipated by the British, who had made all preparations to counter it. South African troops are resisting in the mountains north of Al Alamein, while New Zealand troops are preparing to attack the Axis forces from the right flank. The Axis armored divisions participating in the battle are the German 15th and 21st Divisions, and the Italian Littorio Division. In summary, the great battle is still raging. Cairo believes that the overall situation is "still good" and is eagerly awaiting reinforcements to arrive, so that the British forces can launch a counteroffensive.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Ankara, 6th: Although Washington has denied reports that American troops have arrived in Egypt, news from Cairo states that American troops have recently been arriving in Egypt by plane from India and South Africa. It is also said that some American troops from Iraq have also gone to Egypt. It is widely believed that the American troops who landed in Basra a month ago have already arrived in Egypt.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Lisbon, 6th: Last night, Hungarian radio reported that Axis forces in North Africa had made contact with American troops in the Al Alamein area. This is the first time since the start of the war. However, according to news from Washington, it is difficult to confirm reports circulating in Washington and other capitals that American troops have arrived in the Near East, especially in Egypt. The U.S. War Department has neither confirmed nor denied this news.</p>
<p>Britain Takes Important Measures to Defend the Suez Canal</p>
<p>Havas dispatch from the Swiss capital, 5th: A correspondent for the "National Daily" in Berlin reported today that military and political figures in Berlin are quite satisfied with the development of the Libyan campaign in North Africa. They believe that the German forces in North Africa have been checked around Al Alamein for the past five days and have failed to continue their advance, but this is not necessarily a disadvantage. As for General Rommel's plans, they are currently being kept secret, but it is expected that there will soon be surprising news. It is said that the British army has built a strong line of defense east of Al Alamein. The British General Headquarters is doing everything in its power to prevent General Rommel's troops from approaching the Nile Delta. However, the number of British troops captured in the Egyptian theater has reached 60,000. According to reports from Swiss newspaper correspondents in Britain, people in London believe that the situation in Egypt is extremely critical, but not yet desperate. Military figures believe that the defense of Al Alamein has given the British army a very good opportunity, and that important measures to defend the Suez Canal have also been put in place. In short, time is of the essence at this moment, as General Rommel's forces are currently attempting to rapidly advance towards the Nile Delta, in order to prevent British reinforcements from Syria and Palestine from arriving to reinforce the defense. Furthermore, a correspondent for the "Swiss Daily" in Rome reported on the political plans that Italian officials intend to implement in the Near East in the future on behalf of the Axis powers, stating that Germany and Italy have jointly promised to liberate Egypt and respect its independence. This is by no means a temporary political gesture; on the contrary, it is a long-standing policy of Germany and Italy. Italy is fighting not only for itself, but also for other countries in the Mediterranean. The outcome of the current war will inevitably liberate the countries of the Near East from the shackles of the British Empire.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Ankara, 6th: A dispatch from Cairo states that continuous attacks by the Axis air force on El Qantara have forced ferries traveling between the two banks of the Suez Canal to suspend operations. The railway between Cairo and Port Said has also been damaged in several places. The Egyptian Railway Administration has announced that traffic on this line has been temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Rome, 6th: An official statement issued by the Italian military headquarters this afternoon stated that mechanized units, armored forces, and artillery are very active in the Egyptian theater. Enemy tank formations attacking in various places have been repelled. German and Italian aircraft bombed and strafed enemy concentrations and motor vehicle formations. Several vehicles caught fire or were severely damaged. Eleven enemy aircraft were shot down in aerial combat. Our air force heavily bombed the port facilities of Alexandria and Port Said. Four of our aircraft have not returned to base. It has been confirmed that the 50-ton ship previously reported as sunk by a torpedo has been sunk. British aircraft dropped bombs near Landini yesterday, but there were no losses.</p>
<h3 id="e15">France's Total Expenditure for This Fiscal Year <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Havas dispatch from Vichy, 6th: According to officials, since the armistice, France has shouldered a heavy burden, and the national wealth has been declining daily. Fortunately, with skillful financial management, relying on tax revenue and the proceeds from the issuance of public bonds, all treasury expenditures can still be met comfortably. The total expenditure for this fiscal year, including both regular and temporary expenses, is 138,500,000,000 francs, while regular revenue is 80,000,000,000 francs (mostly tax revenue). In the first quarter of this year, from January to March, tax revenue has exceeded 20,000,000,000 francs, accounting for more than a quarter of the total revenue budget. Based on this projection, it can be seen that this year, relying solely on tax revenue, it will not be difficult to reach the revenue budget of 80,000,000,000 francs. At the same time, the government is making every effort to reduce expenditures to the lowest possible level. During this extraordinary period, various essential expenditures are normally covered by the country's regular revenue. Recently, in order to provide relief to wartime refugees, 2,000,000,000 francs are needed, which has been added to the additional tax revenue item. The total amount of this tax revenue is 275,000,000,000 francs. As for the revenue and expenditure shortfall of 60,000,000,000 francs for this fiscal year, it has been covered by the issuance of public bonds, without the need for the Bank of France to advance funds. However, due to the excessive burden of providing sustenance to the German troops stationed in the occupied territories, the government cannot but increase the issuance of banknotes to compensate for this. Since the French-German armistice, France has had to pay the German army 400 million francs per day, which was later reduced to 300 million francs. On the 4th of last month, the Bank of France also agreed to allocate a special advance of 169,000,000,000 francs to the treasury to provide financial support. Throughout last year, a total of 130,000,000,000 francs was paid to support the German army, 45 percent of which was allocated from regular revenue. From January to May of this year, 44,000,000,000 francs were paid to support the German army, of which only 23,000,000,000 francs, or 52 percent, were advanced by the Bank of France, with the remaining 48 percent being transferred from revenue. However, excessive issuance of banknotes is also a danger. At the end of 1941, the amount of banknotes in circulation was 270,000,000,000 francs. In June 1942, it increased to 300,000,000,000 francs. The increase in the amount of banknotes issued in this fiscal year is even greater. However, there are various reasons for the inflation situation. German troops squander most of their support funds. This is one reason. The German side also uses up a portion of the francs it previously held. This is the second reason. Farmers release hoarded banknotes, and there is an abundance of floating capital in the market. This is the third reason. Fortunately, the government has begun to issue savings bonds, offering preferential interest rates, in order to absorb floating capital from farmers.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Ancient and Modern Arabia <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>The Arabs are a great nation, and their contribution to European culture has its own special merits, which cannot be denied by the world. Regarding this nation, we have introduced several of their small countries in the Near East Special, but only provided a brief introduction in terms of geography and politics. Now we will re-systematically outline the past brilliant history of this nation. Under the current tense situation in the Middle East, it may be helpful!</p>
<p>1.  General Remarks</p>
<p>Arabia, known in Chinese history as Dashi or Tianfang, is an old friend of China. China has two old friends on the Asian continent with whom it has exchanged cultures. One is India, which is relatively close, and the other is Arabia, which is relatively far away. India has indeed given China some valuable things, but what the Arabs have given China is even more valuable and practical. Moreover, the Indians have never established a vast empire spanning Eurasia, while the Arabs have established an empire spanning East and West, and performed magnificent dramas in history with religion, military affairs, politics, and material inventions. As a great nation and great empire that illuminated history for three hundred years, it stood in opposition to the Tang Dynasty of China, another great nation and great empire in Asia. This is indeed a very meaningful coincidence and worthy of special mention.</p>
<p>The general public in China does not seem to feel the existence of such a great historical nation. When they hear the term "Dashi," they only think of antiques stored in the books of archaeologists. There are also films imported from the United States, such as "The Treasure Box of the Imperial Palace," but those craftsmen who translate the explanations simply do not know what they are talking about. They translate Baghdad into a strange sound and translate Caliph into emperor. They know Arabia too little. There is not even a faint shadow on their mental boards.</p>
<p>In fact, as long as we pay attention, traces of Arab culture are everywhere. Chickens and ducks in mosques have a notice-like thing hanging on the shelf, which is Arabic writing. The numbers used by schoolchildren in daily writing, 123456789, are relics invented by the Arabs. The coffee we drink to refresh ourselves was originally produced in the Mocha area along the coast of Arabia, which is a fruit grown on low shrubs. Perhaps technology such as carpet weaving also comes from the Arabs. Chinese folk legends say that the "Huihui" are good at treasure hunting, which also shows that the Arabs are good at business and trade with China.</p>
<p>Among the ethnic components of China, the Han are naturally in the excellent and dominant position. However, when it comes to strength, spirit, and unity, it is necessary to mention the Muslims distributed in the northwest and southwest. These Muslims, in terms of blood, are indeed a mixture of Turks, Mongols, and Han Chinese, but in terms of the fundamental driving force, they are indeed the Arab nation. There are also many ethnic groups around the world who have been driven by the Arab nation and have joined the Islamic organization. --The Moors of North Africa, the Berbers, the Egyptians, the Turanians in the south, the Turks in the middle, the Turks in Asia Minor, and the mixed Tu-Mongol-Han people in northwest China--and China actually has a close relationship with Islam, which cannot be said to be a glory of China. --However, this glory has been neglected and forgotten by the general public in China.</p>
<p>According to the Arab arrival in the east, it actually followed two routes, land and sea. Those who came from the land route were warriors who promoted political and military power, but they were only a minority of the minority. In fact, the Turks cleared the way for them. Those who came from the sea route were merchants engaged in business. These Arabs established strongholds in various coastal areas of China, built Islamic mosques, and had close contact with the Chinese. They actually expanded their power and built the foundation of true Arab culture.</p>
<p>In Chinese political history, the Arabs have also participated in no small part. Emperor Taizong of Tang Dynasty relied heavily on the power of Muslims to gain great success. The Mongols used Muslim cannons to attack the Jin's defenses and achieved great success, fully utilizing Arab technology and talent. After the Mongols entered the Central Plains, they used Semu people as guests and made various strange and ingenious objects for the kings. Among these Semu people, the Arabs were the most numerous. In terms of cultural relics and systems, the Yuan Dynasty attached great importance to the Huihui script and even designated it as the Guozixue. The Huihui script is the Arabic script.</p>
<p>The most interesting story is played by Pu Shougeng, a wealthy and cunning Arab in Quanzhou in the Southern Song Dynasty. Pu Shougeng engaged in maritime trade and served as the Supervisor of Maritime Trade in Quanzhou during the Song Dynasty. At that time, almost all the estimated ships from Ningbo to Guangzhou were under the control of Pu Shougeng alone. The Southern Song Dynasty was oppressed by the Yuan and retreated from Lin'an to Wenzhou, then to Fuzhou, and then to Quanzhou. According to Lu Xiufu's plan, he wanted to use maritime ships to resist the Yuan, that is, to use the navy as the basis to establish the foundation for the revival of the Zhao Song Dynasty. Unexpectedly, in the middle of the way, he offended Pu Shougeng because of the issue of collecting inland river ship taxes. Pu Shougeng surrendered to the Yuan with maritime power, led the way for Zhang Hongfan, and established a large fleet for the Yuan to deal with the Song navy. Therefore, we might as well say that the demise of the Southern Song Dynasty was due to Pu Shougeng, an Arab.</p>
<p>Since the rise of the Arabs in Mecca, from the early 8th century to the end of the 15th century, they monopolized the business of trade between Europe and Asia for nearly 800 years. In the second half of the 8th century, the Abbasid Dynasty, with Baghdad as its capital, made the greatest efforts to travel eastward by sea and trade with China. Its route passed through the Persian Gulf, the Indian Ocean, the Malay Peninsula, and then to Guangzhou, and later to Quanzhou, Ningbo, and Yangzhou. Arab trade with China began in the Tang Dynasty (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e23">11. Sketches of Yemen (2) <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Sana'a had flourished for a while in the past, competing with Mecca for the holy land, and there was a chaotic period, but it eventually failed. The holy land is still in Mecca, and Sana'a has also declined as a result. Before the Portuguese discovered the African route, Sana'a was the main trade center between India and Egypt, but once maritime transport became smooth, no one paid attention to this plateau city anymore. After years of continuous construction, Sana'a has barely recovered a little in terms of urban appearance. The white houses contrast with the brown mountainside. Even now, the elegant name of the Arab Paradise is still placed on its head. Europeans who have lived in the Sana'a area for a long time always like to come here to spend some time. In fact, the weather here is a bit like the Mediterranean coast of Italy!</p>
<p>The old capital of Yemen is Mecca, which is also a large coffee producing area, located southeast of the Red Sea. In the 18th century, it was the largest city in Yemen, with a population of 50,000 people. The city walls alone were three miles long. In 1708, the French wanted to establish a foothold here, but they were not successful. The main trade in Mocha is coffee and spices, which is the main export port of South Arabia, but since Aden's prosperity, it has also fallen into decline like Sana'a. Those past glories have vanished into smoke and given to people as materials for memories. In fact, to say that the port of Aden has an advantage in terms of topography, as it is a military stronghold, and the trade is very small. However, relying on the British's determination to build, the large ocean-going ships first docked there, and the large coal trade also moved over, from which Mecca reflected the decline.</p>
<p>Besides Sana'a Mecca, the only good port in Yemen today is Hodeida. Other major cities include Ibb and Dhamar, which are built in places where there are rivers. These cities also have large bridge gardens. In terms of architectural style, everything is still backward, but in terms of natural scenery, they are all extremely beautiful cities.</p>
<p>The culture of Yemen can be said to be a confluence of Arab and Egyptian cultures. Like this area, it was once very prominent in ancient times, but now everything has passed. We only see that Egypt and Arabia have not been unlucky in these years. How can Yemen be an exception? This situation is not only the case in Yemen, but the entire Near East countries have been hit by the backward trend. The future prosperity of Yemen is closely related to other Near East countries.</p>
<p>Editor's Respectful Note</p>
<p>The "Near East Special" began publishing on May 27 and ends today after more than a month. During this period, the European war situation took a sharp turn for the worse, just as mentioned in the first article of the special, "Opening Remarks": "In order to strengthen its offensive against the Soviet Union, Germany is expected to launch a comeback in North Africa Libya in the near future, attempting to attack Egypt and the Suez Canal..."</p>
<p>Sana'a</p>
<p>Sana'a City is surrounded by brick walls. The barracks on the right were built by the Turks. Bir-el-Azeb behind the city is a famous villa with beautiful scenery, where citizens can also swim.</p>
<p>The shift in the war situation has unfortunately proven us right. Although the development of the entire situation in the Middle East and Near East is still uncertain, our compilation of this special is not in vain.

<h3 id="e29">Barbershops, Awed by Regulations, Voluntarily Reduce Prices by About 10-20% <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The authorities of this city previously announced that from October 17th, all businesses should change their price markings to Central Reserve Certificates (CRC), and the new prices should not exceed half of the average price in old currency in May. Therefore, some shops and companies, not following the regulations, privately raised prices and have been continuously punished by the relevant authorities. However, the barber industry is different. On the one hand, they changed to marking prices in CRC, but on the other hand, they actually increased prices by several times, more than doubling them compared to before. People from all walks of life have been suffering from unbearable burdens. It is now learned that, starting yesterday, barbershops, out of fear of the authorities' regulations and criticism from public opinion, have voluntarily reduced prices by 10-20%. In reality, they still exceed the regulations of the Public Works Department, but according to people in the industry, the skyrocketing water and electricity bills make it truly unavoidable.</p>

<p>Nature is natural, truth is limitless. We humans live and breathe within it, fulfilling our senses and actions, taking and discarding all things. What is the purpose of this? It is said that our existence is a scene in the evolution of nature. Our ability to realize truth, attain its true essence, and achieve good and beautiful living is the radiance of human life. We humans obtain this radiance, and thus human affairs flourish and culture advances daily. Wise people are born in every era, some pursuing the ancients and deeply studying nature, some elucidating reason and revering morality, some refining mind and body and achieving meritorious words and deeds, some enriching experience and increasing intelligence, so that human life trends towards greater greatness and harmony, and then with faith as a guide, aspiring to reach the realm of perfect governance. All of this is exhausting the ultimate principles of human affairs. However, times and places change, human affairs prosper and decline, human desires wax and wane, and truth and falsehood arise together. There is good arising from intellectual cultivation and evil arising from rigidity and long-standing abuses. In the end, order and chaos alternate endlessly. Is it then that the infinite principles of nature and the unpredictable numbers of human affairs are truly beyond the reach of human intelligence? Thereupon, some with thorough understanding turn inward, knowing that there is a self that can participate in the creation of Heaven and Earth, observe the roots of all beings, and follow the continuous path of life, connecting their feelings and emotions without interruption, so as to conform to all natural laws and achieve the way of the self. The form and spirit we possess are not for us to selfishly possess. Many are obscured by selfishness, so they have no way to understand themselves. Therefore, the way of the self lies in seeking self-understanding, not in so-called great self or small self, but in what is naturally caused, with spiritual resonance, the greatest and most unwavering potential of life residing within, manifesting as things and creating radiance. Therefore, those who thoroughly understand the self can establish the highest and most absolute belief in humanity and devote themselves to it, thus achieving a truly interesting and harmonious human world.</p>
<p>As for all things, they all have what they establish and what they achieve. Where does the way of human life establish itself? Where does it achieve? The actions of ancient sages in practicing benevolence and righteousness lie in loving others with virtue and acting in accordance with what is appropriate, thinking carefully and judging clearly, reaching moderation, correcting contemporary abuses, maintaining society, aspiring to mutual respect and love, with sincerity of intention, mutual affection and support, helping each other to succeed, without suspicion, without resentment, and returning to great unity and joy, this is the supreme virtue of human life, which should be known, developed and expanded. Now we examine how much radiance from past generations illuminates us, and we should know to move forward diligently on the great road of light. If not, if we do not choose this ourselves, if we do not think about self-cultivation, it is difficult to avoid vanity and self-righteousness, or actions that are without principle. To the extreme, it will inevitably be like a river flowing downward, sinking into obscurity, and how can it be saved? Therefore, in the present world, we should especially strive to encourage ourselves, know to turn inward, thoroughly understand the self, act on our original aspirations, aspire to beauty and goodness, which is the only trend.</p>
<p>Art is the essence of culture, arising from the beauty of life's interests, possessing creative potential, expressing the feelings of the self, and seeking the true essence. The rise of a nation is due to the development of true spirit and beautiful meaning. The rise of its cultural relics is the manifestation of the beauty of its vital consciousness. When beauty of vital consciousness is present, it can flourish and grow, joyfully and harmoniously. Conversely, if there is too much empty life devoid of culture or substance among a nation, it is no different from a tree that has lost its roots. Even if the branches still exist, there is no hope of rebirth, let alone flourishing and growing. Therefore, the way to seek life lies in love, the attainment of life's interests lies in beauty, the expression of beauty is art, with art, cultural relics are formed, and with cultural relics within, mankind can thrive for a long time, harmoniously, beautifully and virtuously. Therefore, if we want to seek the rise of a nation, we must wait for the rise of culture, and it must be harmonious and virtuous. As for "love" as the benevolent core of life, beauty is the good fruit of life, and goodness is the harmony of life, any academic thought, such as religion, philosophy, science, etc., is moved by beauty, originates in love, and leads to benefiting life and harmony. And art is based on the feelings of the self, achieving its love, expressing its beauty and attaining the joy of true essence.</p>
<p>Indeed, the interests of human life lie in what they desire. When seeking externally, they only take material things, and when seeking internally, they only value the mind. When the mind communicates with material use, joy is attained. When material things block the mind, what interest is there? Human psychology varies according to time, place, emotion, and things, but its trend is all towards harmony, beauty, and goodness. However, it is difficult for human nature to control itself. Some indulge in material desires, taking and demanding, even becoming cruel and unscrupulous, and human morality is abandoned. Some, due to deep-seated habits, abandon their ambitions and follow the waves, not knowing where they are going. Even inertia has become established, and they do not know how to deal with themselves, so that only their physical form remains, but their vitality is no longer, which is truly lamentable! Although, at the extreme, they must return to the root. Everyone at the end of the road, how can there be no reflection? The realization of reflection, there is no small thought. Therefore, those who are good at their spiritual self-cultivation will strive to advance and seek to achieve a life of beauty and goodness.</p>

<p>Kang Liwen's home at No. 42 Jiangjia Port, Haining Road, was suddenly invaded by several bandits on the afternoon of December 14, 1937, with the intention of robbery. At that time, Tang immediately sounded the alarm, causing the bandits to not dare to rob and flee in different directions. However, Tang knew that the bandits would definitely not give up, so he planned a method of defense. Tang was friendly with Liu Xuecheng, Chinese detective No. 238 of the Police Department of the Public Concession, so he invited Liu to his home for protection. Detective Liu accepted the request and went to Tang's home at 8 PM that afternoon. Just as he arrived at Tang's gate, the gang of bandits came again to rob, and they met Liu. The bandits held four or five weapons and were numerous. Liu was outnumbered and was captured by them. They robbed Liu of the long robe he was wearing, the money in his pocket, a .38 caliber pistol, and bullets. They also copied a business card from his pocket, knowing that he was a detective. Fearing that releasing him would be detrimental to them, they fired three shots, killing Liu, and fled in all directions. Afterwards, Chinese and foreign detectives from the Huisi Police Station arrested Zhao Xiaosizi (34 years old) from Jiangbei, the principal offender in the case. It was found that Zhao was the one who committed the crime. He was sent to court and sentenced to death, which has already been confirmed. This morning, he was ordered to be executed by hanging. When the judge interrogated him, asking if he had any last words, Zhao only asked to notify his friend Xia Chao, who lived at No. 10 Rue Robert, to collect his remains. The judge then ordered him to be sent to Nanshi for execution by hanging.</p>

<p>The Liushen Pills sold by Suzhou Lei Yunshang Pharmacy at the intersection of Minguo Road and Xingsheng Street outside Xinbei Gate are famous at home and abroad and have a long history. As a result, some unscrupulous people often counterfeit fake medicines and sell them in the market. Last month, the owner of the store found that someone was privately setting up a fake Liushen Pills factory in Room 18 of the Nuxing Hotel on Avenue Edward VII. He immediately entrusted lawyer Zhu Yisheng to report to the French police station, which dispatched detectives Shen Lianfang, Xia Guoxiang, etc., to rush to the Anxing Hotel and arrest the brothers Lou Kunshan and Lou Pintang. A large number of counterfeit Liushen Pills, instruction manuals, bottles, boxes, and other evidence were confiscated on the spot and taken to the police station for investigation and handling. The day before yesterday, the detectives learned that the counterfeiters had a main factory for counterfeiting this medicine in a bungalow in Lianqingfang, Wanbang Road, Nanshi. They immediately coordinated with the police district to send personnel to assist in rushing to the address and confiscated a large batch of counterfeit goods such as Liushen Pills and instruction manuals worth tens of thousands of gold, which were transported back to the police station by truck. The accomplice Zhong Lin was also arrested on the spot and taken to the police station for detention, awaiting joint investigation with the Lous.</p>

<p>After the dissolution of the refugee relief associations and various refugee shelters of the Cilian Disaster Relief Association's branch in this city, the elderly, disabled, orphans, and widows who were left with no support were accommodated by the Cilian Disaster Relief Association at the former site of the Ciyuan Shelter on North Zhejiang Road, which was established as the Yangji Almshouse and Ciji Place, accommodating more than 1,000 people. The provisions for the Yangji Almshouse were originally funded by the Public Works Department, and all other expenses were borne by the Cilian Disaster Relief Association. Now, the Public Works Department will terminate its provisions for the almshouse on the 15th of this month, and the entire burden will be borne by the Cilian Association. The monthly expenditure is about 60,000 yuan. The association has no foundation, donations have become exhausted, and at this time of soaring prices, they can only sigh and lament, barely surviving. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will generously show their compassion and enthusiastically sponsor this cause, so that these thousands of refugees can barely survive, a work of immeasurable merit.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Huang Xuanping Broadcasts the Grain Rationing Plan Yesterday <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Huang Xuanping, a member of the Price Control Committee of the Public Works Department, at the request of the Public Works Department, broadcasted on the Shanghai Direction Radio Station at 8 PM last night, explaining the grain rationing plan. The following is the record of his speech:</p>
<p>Tonight, I am entrusted by the Public Works Department of the Public Concession to use wireless radio to explain to you the bureau's grain distribution plan. The purpose is to explain some points of the distribution plan and methods. Although this plan is progressing very smoothly now, and more than 75% of Shanghai residents have already obtained grain purchase certificates, there are still many residents who have not yet obtained grain purchase certificates, and there are still some unclear points about this plan. I will now explain them separately.</p>
<p>You must know that Chinese people living in the Public Concession, regardless of age, gender, or child, have the right to obtain a grain purchase certificate. As long as the person is confirmed to be alive, even a newborn infant of one day, if the local Baojia or the police station in the district can prove that there is indeed such a person, they can obtain a grain purchase certificate.</p>
<p>Those who indirectly pay taxes to the Public Works Department must firmly ensure that those who directly pay house taxes in the house apply to the Public Works Department for grain purchase certificates and distribute them to them. Applying for grain purchase certificates for subtenants is the duty of the head tenant. Every head tenant should fulfill his duty. He cannot fail to fulfill it, nor can he ask the subtenant for any exchange conditions. If the head tenant refuses to fulfill his duty, the subtenant should report it to the police station or Baojia in the district.</p>
<p>It has now been determined that from July 6th of this year, the Public Works Department's rice can only be purchased from retail rice shops with a grain purchase certificate.</p>
<p>The members of a family do not all have to rush to the rice shop to buy rice. One person can represent many people in a family. In this way, the situation of queuing to buy rice can be avoided.</p>
<p>You also do not have to rush to the rice shop to buy rice on the first day of each week, because there is a week for you, from July 6th to the 11th. On any day of the week, you can take the first coupon of the grain purchase certificate and go to the rice shop number written on the coupon to buy rice. The Public Works Department guarantees that you will definitely be able to buy the rice eaten by your family.</p>
<p>Taxpayers, if you are not careful and do not know when and where you can receive the first batch of grain purchase certificates, please bring your house tax receipt for the June quarter of this year to the grain distribution office in this district between 3 PM and 5 PM on any day to contact them. However, you must contact them there before July 10th to be able to receive the rice distributed in the first week. If there are still people who do not know where to find the grain distribution office, they can inquire at each Baojia in the district or at any grain purchase certificate issuing office.</p>
<p>For the convenience of the people and to ensure that they can take home all the rice used by their families, those who have a rice transportation permit can now transport up to three dou of rice. If the quantity exceeds three dou, they must first obtain a rice transportation permit from the Public Works Department Grain Office before they are allowed to transport it.</p>
<p>The rice distributed in the first week can be purchased between July 6th and 11th with the first coupon of the grain purchase certificate. The quantity is two sheng, including one and a half sheng of white rice and half a sheng of broken rice. The total price is five new yuan. In the second week, the second coupon of the grain purchase certificate is used. In addition to being able to buy one and a half sheng of rice, you can also buy about one and a half jin of flour, equal to 1.65 pounds or 0.75 kilograms.</p>
<p>Foreign residents within the Public Concession who have Chinese servants should present their house tax receipts to the grain distribution office to apply for rice for them. The list of grain distribution offices has already been published in the newspapers on June 24th of this year.</p>
<p>Taxpayers who are unable to present their house tax receipts for the June quarter and therefore cannot obtain a grain purchase certificate should bring the tax notice issued by the bureau for the quarter to Office No. 54 of the tax collection section to contact them.</p>
<p>Regarding the grain distribution plan, if there are still unclear points, please send written inquiries to the Price Control Office at No. 109 Jiangxi Road.</p>

<p>Qiu Shaoqing, a 40-year-old employee of Zhongfu Trading Company at No. 93 Guangdong Road, lives at No. 51 Chengyu Li, Caishi Road, French Concession. He married a Shaoxing woman, Zhang, and their relationship was still harmonious. Later, Qiu went to his mother-in-law Zhang Wang's house at No. 39 Hengmao Li, Baxianqiao, and became acquainted with Ruan Shi, a widow who was a housemate of his mother-in-law. Over time, they developed an illicit relationship. Qiu, coveting Ruan's wealth, abandoned his wife as if she were a stranger. On the 29th of last month, Qiu went to Ruan Shi's house again to linger, and was followed by his wife and mother-in-law, who went to negotiate and persuade him to go home. Unexpectedly, Qiu, out of shame and anger, became violent on the spot and beat his wife and mother-in-law. They were intimidated by his ferocity and reluctantly returned. The next day, Qiu's anger had not subsided. After returning home, he beat his wife again. The mother and daughter, unable to bear it any longer, filed a complaint with the police station. Qiu has now been ordered to be summoned for questioning.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Bare Feet and Stockings by Yinzi <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Six or seven years ago, a certain gentleman said to a certain lady with a sarcastic tone: "The current situation is truly strange. Women's sleeves have gone from long sleeves to medium sleeves, to short sleeves, to sleeveless; trousers have gone from long trousers to shorts, to briefs; socks have gone from knee-high to ankle-high, to bare feet; and adding open-toed shoes, they don't consider it indecent. Men, on the other hand, are wrapped up in layers from head to toe. It's already impolite not to wear a jacket in social gatherings, let alone going bare-armed and bare-legged, which would be considered utterly disrespectful?" The lady, usually fond of arguing for gender equality, was left speechless. Recently, the lady recalled the old days and said to the gentleman: "The trend of 'economic competition, one economic' is prevalent. There are 'economic' snacks, 'economic' set meals, 'economic' hotels, 'economic' equipment, 'economic'... In the end, businessmen are the most particular about 'economic' benefits. For 'economic' procedures, they simply add the letters 'ORB' to the original price, which is really killing two birds with one stone. Not to mention other things, just look at socks these days. Ordinary cotton socks cost fifteen or sixteen yuan in savings certificates, silk stockings cost over twenty yuan, and even short socks cost at least five or six yuan. How can everyone not become barefoot immortals?" The gentleman was also rendered speechless.</p>
<p>In recent decades, with the rise of the thigh beauty trend, fashionable women have been competing to go barefoot, painting their toes with bright red nail polish, and adorning their ankles with delicate gold chains, which has caused several scholarly gentlemen to frown, close their eyes, shake their heads, and sigh in despair at the declining morals and changing times. Since the surge in prices, the number of people going barefoot has surpassed the number of legs on barges, and people's perceptions have greatly shifted, with a layer of understanding added to the opposition.</p>
<p>As for those who still adhere to the principle of wearing socks, if you take off Zhang San's shoes and look, there are holes in his toes and holes in his heels; if you take off Li Si's shoes and look, there are also holes everywhere. As long as there are no problems with the tops of the socks, they can barely get by, and the lifespan of these socks can be prolonged for a few more days. Everyone holds the attitude of "Heaven sees me wearing socks, and the earth sees me barefoot." This philosophy of wearing socks is very popular in this era. I am one of them. After all, I am not a fashionable woman, and there is no need to show off my leg beauty - in fact, even barefoot, they are not very attractive. I have neither blood-like nail polish nor expensive gold chains - and I can't stand the condemning gaze of my elders. Therefore, in the cold winter, I certainly wear them, and even when I go out in the hot summer, I still wear long silk stockings. However, I am ultimately out of touch with the trend, and passersby cast strange glances, as if saying, "This woman doesn't go barefoot!"</p>
<p>If you are going to the park to cool off after a bath, or taking a walk on a quiet road with two or three close friends in the evening, going barefoot is the coolest and most comfortable thing to do. But due to the social fabric woven from thousands of years of customs, habits, and various cultures, there are not many things that can make people feel comfortable. How convenient and comfortable it would be to wear short clothes and shorts when visiting guests, just like at home, but you have to wear a long gown. Men, when necessary, even have to wear a mandarin jacket. There are some restraints and formalities, but can you not wear them? At a grand banquet, you suffer for hours with a stiff collar and a tailcoat, but you still hope that you will have the honor of participating in the next banquet. Would you dare to go to the company with messy hair and a pale face to buy something? Therefore, during cooling off and strolling, in self-entertainment, it is like stealing some liberation from the cracks of the yoke, while going barefoot at a visit or banquet is really not elegant and lacks etiquette. Some people may accuse me of not shedding the remnants of feudalism, lacking vigorous vigor, and not breaking this yoke of etiquette to seek complete liberation, resembling a pedantic old fool. Why not seek comfort in life practically, but instead be bound by hypocritical etiquette? Let the world liberate the body and mind of men and women and render thick Romantie colors. However, look, is it really true that society does not need etiquette as a guideline to maintain good customs and human emotions? Can the relationship between people return to the simplicity of primitive times? Moreover, in this vast world, where is a peaceful land? What Romantie colors are we talking about?</p>
<p>However, recently, going barefoot is no longer just a matter of leg beauty. Even those with unattractive legs have to show their ugliness. Is it really the high tide of prices that makes me have to give up my cultivation? Or should I still hold on to my philosophy of wearing socks? Perhaps when the price frenzy surges again, it will also sweep me into the era of barefoot madness!</p>
<h3 id="e44">A Casual Discussion on Shop Signs by Qin Meng <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Shop signs are the signboards of shops. In ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad, old shop signs are considered valuable. There is a shop in Beiping with a truly long history. The sign was written by Yan Song. Yan Song was not a calligrapher, and his character is despised by everyone. The reason why the shop protects it as if they fear losing it is also to sell on its antiquity.</p>
<p>I have done a small survey and found that the naming of shop signs can be roughly divided into ten categories: First, old shops seek good luck first, such as Yong Sheng, Xiang Mao, Heng Tai, and Jin Long. Second, place names, national names, and personal names are easy to remember, such as Zhong Shan, Washington, Paris, Far East, Sino-British, and Shu Rong. Third, they boast of business advantages to attract customers, such as Yun Fei, Yi Le Ye, Jin Jin, Er Wo Xuan, and Jie Er Jing. Fourth, the boss likes fame and uses his own name as the shop sign, such as Zhang Xiao Quan, Guan Sheng Yuan, Chen A Xiao, and Feng Cun Ren. Fifth, new terms are both fashionable for a while and popular with the public. Using them as shop signs can save on publicity, such as New Life, Min Sheng, Metropolitan, San Min, Victory, Republic, and Dazhong. Sixth, transliteration of English and American words, or consideration of both meaning and pronunciation, such as MGM, Summer Pieke, Parker, Paramount, and Henry. Seventh, ancient or modern buildings that are familiar to the general public, such as Sao Ye Shan Fang, Fan Wang Gong, Xing Hua Lou, and Yi He Yuan. Eighth, the shop sign is titled with a welcoming tone, such as Try it and Delicious Come. Ninth, the business scope is marked on the shop sign, mostly in the banking industry, such as Jian Ye, Farmer, Border Colony, Fishery, and Transportation. Tenth, deliberately shocking people to attract customers, such as Wonderland, Happy Forest, Heaven, and Lou Wai Lou. There are thousands of shop signs, and the naming methods are naturally more than these. This is just a brief example of what I thought of at the time of writing.</p>
<p>The writing of shop signs in Shanghai, except for art fonts, is almost monopolized by a few people. Ten years ago, Tang Tuo was very popular. At least three out of ten shop signs were written by him. The brush fee earned him 20,000 gold a year, and there was a trend from idolization to superstition. At that time, it was rumored that if a shop did not ask a certain Tang to write the sign, it would be certain to close within three years. After Tang Tuo's death, Tan Ze Guan rose to prominence. In the past five or six years, in terms of quantity and income, he has broken Tang Tuo's record. The next is Wang Shao Xi, followed by Yu You Ren, followed by Zhang Jun, and in addition, Huang Bao Wu and Ma Gong Yu also wrote a lot.</p>
<p>The strangest naming of shop signs is the Bolanglin Food Company, which opened on Wuma Road (I remember it was near the Central Grand Hotel) eight or nine years ago. The person who named it was probably a madman, otherwise his heart is punishable! According to Bolanglin, it is a pistol. If customers patronize the store, wouldn't they admit that they are taking hygienic pills to kill them? If this store does not close, there is no justice - as a result, it has been closed for a long time in less than a year.</p>
<p>Before August 13th, Sincere Company had a horizontal shop sign that stretched straight along Nanjing Road to Zhejiang Road, writing "Sincere Company manages global goods, Chinese domestic products, north and south seafood, Chinese and Western utensils, Guandong ginseng...", which was more than thirty feet long. If it was erected, its height could be side by side with the International Hotel. Its length is definitely the first in the city. During the "August 13th" battle, the company was hit by a giant bomb. Later, the facade was rebuilt, and it was never seen again.</p>
<p>The area of shop signs is generally proportional to the size of the storefront, but there are exceptions. The International Hotel near the racecourse has magnificent architecture, not only the first in Shanghai, but also the first in the Far East. However, the size of its shop sign is unbelievable. The five chrome letters of "International Hotel" are affixed to the lintel at the entrance, and the size is only similar to children's blocks.</p>
<p>Pickle shops often enlarge the words "pharmacy", which is particularly magnified, and I don't understand its meaning. The size of the fonts is enough to be frightening, and the diameter of the strokes is as large as two feet, and the entire area of the word often has four or five feet in size. A certain mathematician said that with ordinary eyesight, as long as you can see the money without obstruction, even at a distance of 19,000 meters, you can still see it clearly. My late friend Zheng Zhengqiu was extremely nearsighted. During his lifetime, I once took him for a walk on Avenue Road. Because he was not wearing glasses, I pointed to the words "pickle shop" on the opposite side of the road for him to recognize, but he said he couldn't see it. Pitiable and ridiculous.</p>
<p>Since the invention of neon tubes, the decoration of shop signs has been completely new, but this thing is easily damaged, often resulting in incomplete strokes. Tianyunlou often becomes "Dayin Woman", and Guangshengyuan turns into "Inch of Land". In mid-July of the 27th year of the Republic of China, a storm swept through Shanghai and damaged many neon shop signs. The four words "Tianchu MSG" on the top of the International Hotel actually became "A Bite of Rice". At the time, it looked plain and unremarkable. Currently, rice is so expensive that it costs a thousand yuan per stone. There are very few people who can afford two bites of rice. If this shop sign is damaged and becomes its old appearance, I dare say that passers-by will inevitably swallow their saliva nonstop when they pass by.</p>
<p>Here are two examples of shop signs with novel and unique names: A certain eyeglass company on Nanjing Road has a shop sign that reads "OIC", which is homophonic with Oh! I See! If a person like Zheng Zhengqiu saw it, wouldn't he be attracted and spend money? A bathhouse named "Daguan Garden" on Nicheng Bridge is full of naked bodies like a forest, and mermaids fill the pool. The two words "Daguan" (Grand View) are appropriately named. Hotels are like lawyers, often not big but big. There are two who admit to being small hotels, one near Hengbang Bridge on North Sichuan Road, the name has been forgotten, and the other on Mintini Yin Road Nanyang Bridge, called Southeast Small Hotel. It is good for shop sign names to be elegant, but they should not be too unpopular. Some people title a restaurant "One Who Dwells Nearer", which no one understands. When asked, they take the Analects: "Those who are near are pleased, and those who are far away come." There is also a painting shop in Yixing North Main Street called "Te Jian Drug Store", which was titled by a famous scholar in the city. It is not without origin, but it is too elegant! When it first opened, there were many misunderstandings. When I was a child, I once went to buy Liuwei Dihuang Pills, and the shopkeeper thought I was deliberately messing around. I also argued hard to justify myself, almost turning into a three-act Iron Rooster drama, which is ridiculous! (End)</p>

<p>Since the active handling of food distribution per capita in this city, the general poor population is quite gratified because they no longer need to endure the suffering of being squeezed when buying rice in the streets. However, some cunning people are taking this opportunity to spread rumors to deceive the villagers living in the suburbs, falsely claiming to buy rice directly from the Shanghai Municipal Council in the Public Concession, selling each dou for only thirty yuan in savings certificates, and that this rice payment must first be collected by the notifying person. The villagers are ignorant and mostly deceived. Therefore, in recent days, there have been many people holding fake receipts to collect rice from the Municipal Council. Once they learn that there is no such thing and that it is a scam, they cry incessantly in front of the Municipal Council Building, which is truly pitiful.</p>

<p>The English Times reported that the Superintendent of Police of the Shanghai Municipal Council made a statement yesterday, saying that members of the local defense corps continue to provide valuable assistance to the police. The reduction in robberies in the concession is indeed due to them. In this month, members of the local defense corps were responsible for arresting sixty-eight criminals in a total of sixty cases, and also provided a lot of assistance in many other cases. The Superintendent of Police also said that the organization of the Baojia Corps has been of great help in reducing crimes in the concession.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Huashang stock market situation saw Shanghai Cotton Micro Manufacturing Plant stocks newly enter the market for circulation. Investors were enthusiastic, and the market price rose steadily, remaining in a buying frenzy throughout the day and rising to 21 and a half yuan. The prices of other stocks mostly increased compared to last Saturday's prices, with only New Pharmaceutical stocks showing fatigue, with market prices fluctuating within a small range. The stock prices of each market are recorded below.</p>

<p>The public bond gray market still did not break away from the fluctuating situation yesterday, with a slightly weaker trend. Because the financial community sold more through the same smooth method, the market price tended to be firmer, slightly exceeding last Saturday's closing price, and then fell back. Because there was no interest in buying, it was not at all excited. Those who were long were all thinking of a five-day Beijing official. Therefore, it is difficult to expect improvement for a while, and the transaction volume has also been greatly reduced. As a result, the market price, except for the slightly better one point, the rest were down three or five points. The turnover was only about seven or eighty million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>

<p>The bean market saw a turning trend yesterday, which was weaker because shop hoarding and importing were limited in the sound of price restrictions. Therefore, the market has consistently slightly weakened. A total of 60 bags of Sangyuan soybeans were opened, priced at 195 yuan. 20 bags of Chongming sand silkworms, priced at 113 yuan. 40 bags of Hongqiao New Qing silkworms, priced at 175 yuan to 170 yuan. 30 bags of Tianjin mung beans, priced at 220 yuan.</p>

<p>Dried sweet potatoes are both good for sales and sales. The sellers' intention to sell is slightly relaxed, and the price has fallen by two yuan.

<p>Soybean cake sales started sluggishly and then moved. The market initially fatigued and then firmed. It was not much different from before. A total of 500 pieces of Hankou old cake were opened, priced at 43 yuan. 1,000 pieces of Lizi cake new goods in May, priced at 57 yuan and a half to 57 yuan and 7 jiao. 500 pieces of Shenji cake old goods in September, priced at 51 yuan. 500 pieces of new goods in called months, priced at yuan and 18 yuan, and 500 pieces of new goods in June, priced at 58 yuan and a half.</p>

<p>The selling price of cigarettes is difficult to boost, because both customer sales and local streets are deserted. Peers have to sell all kinds of goods at low prices, and they cannot sell them all at once. For the sake of funds, they mostly cut prices and sell cheaply. At present, life is difficult to recover in the sound of the high heat wave. The opening prices yesterday were like Da Ying Pi at 8,800 yuan, Lao Dao Pai at 5,850 yuan, Pinhai Pai at 4,800 yuan, Xiannv Pai at 3,900 yuan, and Wuhua Pai at 3,700 yuan, with slight differences compared to the weekend.

A total of Golden Building Brand still opened at 2,100 yuan, Red Rose Brand at 1,200 yuan, Quanlu Brand at 1,900 yuan, and Compass Brand at 1,300 yuan. National Cigarette Golden Mouse Brand at 1,600 yuan, Beauty Brand at 3,100 yuan, and Pyramid at 2,850 yuan, showing a market without a market.</p>
<p>The daily necessities market shows a flat fatigue. Due to the strict prohibition of transportation and selling prices, people's hearts are tired. Therefore, both buying and selling are quiet. The opening prices are Phoenix Brand 3,000 yuan, Beauty Brand 3,250 yuan, Zapi 2,350 yuan, Gu Bensao 335 yuan, Bai Xiang Mao Zao 245 yuan, Huang Xiang Mao Zao 210 yuan, Scissors Zao 265 yuan, Bai Li Shi Yang Candles still 120 yuan, Monk Hat Brand 115 yuan, all see Bu You.</p>

<h3 id="e65">The Path of Learning Requires Self-Exploration <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— Tan Ying</p>
<p>The severity of the academic problems faced by young people has garnered deep attention from all sectors of society, thanks to the initial public discussion by the press. Each day, newspapers carry several articles from young students, especially this year's graduates, appealing to society. They are all shouting, "What is our way out?" All society can offer them is empty sympathy, but no satisfactory answer. Although I personally do not yet have a direct stake in this issue, I found myself in the same predicament last year at this time. Now that I have been fortunate enough to gain an opportunity to study, how can I dare remain indifferent? I would like to offer my learning experience of the past year as a reference for this year's secondary school graduates.</p>
<p>I remember it was mid-June last year when the graduation exams were over. My classmates were excitedly discussing their future paths. Some were preparing to continue their education, while others had already secured decent jobs. When they asked about my plans, I could not answer a word and could only offer a bitter smile. Indeed, at that time, I had no confidence in either of those options. Although the cost of living last year was lower than this year, my family's financial situation still could not support my studies. As for employment, I felt that I lacked both the ability and connections. Under such circumstances, my anxiety reached its peak. Despite the anxiety, I did not despair. I held a firm belief in my heart: as long as I strive forward, the path ahead will not be an insurmountable cliff, and there will definitely be a path to take. So, I wrote many letters to my relatives and old friends, asking them to help me as much as possible. At the same time, I flipped through newspapers every day, hoping to find an opportunity. Finally, one day, I received two pieces of good news.</p>
<p>An old gentleman—my relative—was willing to provide my tuition fees. Because I was unwilling to accept such a large amount of help without a good reason, I politely declined. Finally, he earnestly said to me, "I know that young people are not very willing to accept help from others. Let us devise a plan now. Consider it as me lending you money to study, and you can repay me when you can support yourself. There are many examples of borrowing money to study, and it is not shameful. You must know that my willingness to help you is not to show you special favor but to fulfill my duty to the nation and society. Therefore, I hope that you can also use your strength to help other poor students in the future." Although I ultimately did not accept his help because I found another opportunity, his kind and benevolent intention deeply moved me. I hope that the wealthy people in society can all follow the example of this old gentleman.</p>
<p>The second piece of good news was that a newspaper published an advertisement from an industrial school offering free board and lodging to enrolling students. To me, this was even more exciting than the former. However, to establish a firm footing for myself, I had to investigate its background from all sides. After a newspaper helped me investigate, it turned out that it was established by several factories to train specialized talents, and its purpose was very pure. So I went to register for the entrance exam. Unexpectedly, although it was recruiting more than twenty students, only two hundred people applied—I think some people may not have taken the exam because they were unclear about the situation! So, I was lucky enough to be admitted. Because we had to complete a four-year curriculum in two years, we had to attend thirty to forty hours of classes a week. Due to the stability of life and the lack of external temptations, we did not feel overly burdened. A year has passed quickly. Although the environment will change frequently, and no one can guarantee that the next year or two can be spent safely, I am gratified that I was able to obtain the opportunity to study in the past year!</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Xun once said, "What is a road? A road is opened up from thorns." Due to this experience, I am even more convinced of its truth. Friends, do not be discouraged by the obstacles ahead. Strengthen your beliefs and use your efforts to explore the future. Do not let time slip away in distress!</p>
<p>Opportunity will not wait for you ahead, but you have to pursue it yourself.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Summer Trio of Baths <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— Ruo Xian</p>
<p>The so-called summer trio of baths refers to sunbathing, cold water bathing, and gastrointestinal bathing. The first two are well-known to people, while the latter is often not noticed by the general public. If we often practice these three types of baths, not only will diseases have nothing to do with us, but even those suffering from gastrointestinal diseases and skin problems can often achieve therapeutic effects without medication. Therefore, summer is a good season for us to improve our health, and we must not let it slip away lightly. Now, let me briefly explain these three types of baths below.</p>
<p>Sunbathing</p>
<p>Performing sunbathing in the summer is most effective and extremely convenient. In summer, our clothes are thin, and we have the most opportunities to come into contact with sunlight. Direct contact can enhance the resistance of our skin, and indirectly, it can increase the number of blood cells and blood circulation. Moreover, because of the effect of ultraviolet rays in sunlight, it can kill bacteria in skin diseases and is often used as a self-treatment for skin diseases. When using sunbathing in the summer, the time should not be too long. Ten minutes to fifteen minutes is enough, and it is even more important to avoid holding it when the sunlight is strongest at noon, otherwise, it often causes phenomena such as sunburned skin, dizziness, and blurred vision. When using it, the body should be turned frequently so that the whole body has the opportunity to receive sunlight. The head must be covered, and it is best to wear a pair of black glasses to avoid the occurrence of the above phenomena. The location for the exercise can be indoors or outdoors. When holding it indoors, pay attention to opening the window, because ordinary glass cannot pass through the ultraviolet rays in sunlight.</p>
<p>Cold Water Bath</p>
<p>Regardless of how the cold water bath is used, the most important step is to rub. Because after a cold water bath, it can lower body temperature and cause phenomena such as pore contraction. Therefore, the whole body must be rubbed until it feels warm. Cold water baths are especially welcomed by people in summer. They are exceptionally cool after bathing, refreshing the mind, and can increase the efficiency of the work of various organs of the body.</p>
<p>Gastrointestinal Bath</p>
<p>The so-called gastrointestinal bath refers to skipping a meal and replacing it with an appropriate amount of water or other liquid food. This allows the stomach and intestines to get a full rest time, increases digestion and absorption capacity, and gastrointestinal diseases will not occur. Because stomach and intestinal diseases are often caused by eating too much; the stomach does not have sufficient digestive power, often producing a toxic substance remaining in the body, thus causing gastrointestinal poisoning, which we call autointoxication. Although this method is not practiced every day, several times a week is enough, whether morning or evening. However, drink more liquid foods when practicing it, because people will not starve to death without eating for several days but cannot live without water for several days.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Leather Shoes and Western Suits <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— Na Han</p>
<p>To tell you the truth, leather shoes have become cheaper. The cause is of course the French Municipal Council's imposing punishment notice. On Avenue Joffre, from Rue Hua Long to Rue du Pere Froc, almost every one of the 739 stores had a notice posted on its glass window ordering them to suspend business. According to a leather shoe store owner who was punished, "Since being punished, everyone has automatically reduced prices by 30%. Currently, leather shoes priced above 300 yuan have disappeared from display windows. They are mostly around 200 yuan. Friends who have never seen prices go down after the price list has been going straight up for five years feel that their "vision" has become much more comfortable."</p>
<p>The punished stores have unanimously argued that the raw materials came from the black market, but the authorities have refuted this reason. At the same time, they have also searched and investigated more than twenty phone numbers specializing in black market speculation and punished them severely. However, the stores have raised the black market prices even higher. (Of course, most of the stores themselves hoarded some raw materials long ago and feared that the world would not be chaotic.) The cost of living has soared, and so it is endless. Although 200 yuan CRB is still beyond the reach of the middle class, it is better than 300 yuan half a month ago.</p>
<p>In order to study the market situation, no, to inquire about market prices, I happened to walk into a tailor shop and asked about the material. After asking, I found out that all the goods priced below 200 yuan per yard were said to be "inferior goods," that is, so-called unpopular goods that few people care about. The price of one piece of material was 620 yuan per yard, 30% off, the actual price was 424 yuan per yard. Calculating 2.75 yards for a suit, plus the tailoring fee, the total is 1,366 yuan CRB (it is said that 200 yuan for tailoring is still the minimum lining material used). There was a suit in the display window of a store in Wangjiasha that looked mediocre. When asked about the price, it was 2,000 yuan. An apprentice from a certain store earnestly stated: "The 'Sportsman' cloth, chessboard street has no samples, the price exists, 6,000 yuan CRB can buy it, the last time I saw the mediocre suit in Wangjiasha, it has been confirmed to be 'Sportsman' without a doubt."</p>
<p>Market prices are soaring, leather shoe stores have come down, but tailor shops are the most aggressive. At the same time, there has been no news of rewards and punishments as swift as those for leather shoe stores. Since wool has been calculated in CRB, it has been rising every day, let alone calculating it at 50% off or 66% from July 16 to 28, I am afraid it will jump three levels. It is really "the poor man's pants have two holes, when will the season of changing clothes come."</p>
<h3 id="e68">Ode to Banknotes <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Xiang</p>
<p>Mr. Guan held a "Historical Banknote Exhibition" at the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association. Many people went to see it. I recall Mr. Yu Shenwu's "Ode to Banknotes," which is very meaningful. I am recording it as follows: "Oh, banknotes, banknotes, they are not firewood, they cannot withstand fire, they cannot withstand water. The bank is their prison, and the fund is their support. Regardless of firewood, rice, oil, or clothing, shoes, and hats, they can all be handled with them, but without them, things go wrong. Friends and relatives often quarrel over them, and wives leave because of them. They are truly cunning, eccentric, and evil demon kings, and everyone is fascinated by them. How can you blame those inferior fellows for flattering and shamelessly ignoring people's scolding? The rich and powerful show off their power, shouting that they don't care, 'Brothers have plenty of cash.'"</p>

<p>Cheng walked from the side room to the hall. Old Mrs. Chen came out from the kitchen in the back and smiled, "Mr. Ye, feel free to walk around. Our house can't compare to your house, which is spacious and tidy. Fangguan told me about it. Because we weren't originally from Xiaoqiao, we bought this house as it was. I think my son doesn't want to live here, and my grandsons and granddaughters are even less likely to want to live here. When I, the old woman, kick the bucket, it will only be locked up." Wei Cheng said, "This house is also good, tight and elegant. When their siblings come back, will they live in the rooms on the east side?" Old Mrs. Chen pointed, "Yes, the two rooms on the east side, one for each sibling." Old Mrs. Chen opened the waist door leading from the hall. Wei Cheng smiled, "On the dressing table, there are cologne bottles, powder boxes, and powder jars. That must be Miss Guofang's room." Old Mrs. Chen said, "Yes. Fangguan is also naughty. When she came back during the summer vacation last year, the countryside is always the scenery of the countryside, and there are naturally mosquitoes at night. But there is only one cool gauze mosquito net at home, and the siblings quarreled over it, Guoqi wanted it, and Fangguan also wanted it. I said that the younger sister should let the older brother. Mr. Ye, what do you think she said? She said, 'Now there is gender equality.'" Wei Cheng stood in the middle of Guofang and Guoqi's rooms, looked at both sides, and smiled, "Great Aunt, I guess the result was that Miss Guofang won. It's a pity I don't have such a sister. If I had such a sister, I would also be willing to let her win. But Great Aunt loves granddaughters more than grandsons, doesn't she?"</p>
<p>Wei Cheng's words gradually became less polite, and Old Mrs. Chen was also very happy to talk to him. After a while, she went to the kitchen to see if the cured meat was cooked. After a while, she came back to talk to Wei Cheng. Wei Cheng followed her instructions and took off his gown. Smelling a waft of meat fragrance, he said, "Great Aunt, just treat me as your grandson, don't treat me as a guest. One or two dishes are enough, don't bother too much." Old Mrs. Chen smiled, "I don't have the blessing to treat Mr. Ye as my grandson. Even if I treat you as my grandson, I love my grandsons and granddaughters. When they come back, I have to treat them to a happy meal." Wei Cheng laughed. (121)</p>
<h3 id="e70">Economical YMCA Swimming Club <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Meng</p>
<p>I am not interested in other sports, but I am quite fond of swimming. In previous years, I always had to take some time out of my busy schedule to practice swimming during the summer. On the eve of this summer vacation, the swimming season has started as usual, which makes me unconsciously savor the fun of practicing swimming with friends in previous years. The city swimming pool, the Hongkou swimming pool, and even the seaside beach all seem to appear before my eyes, as if I am on the scene. However, the war has stopped everything in the world, and we have been separated from these swimming pools for four or five years.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people will say that if you want to swim, aren't there still several swimming pools open in the public concession and the French concession every year? That's right, but these are all commercial swimming pools, and the tickets are quite expensive. During rest time, servants will peddle food to you, as if you are not worthy of entering this kind of swimming pool without eating something. Especially this year, the swimming pool tickets cost four or five yuan in central reserve certificates. Do you think we salary earners are qualified to go to these places to swim often? Therefore, I have not entered the swimming pool for five whole years.</p>
<p>Recently, I found out in the newspaper that the Chinese YMCA Sports Department's Zhongqing Swimming Club is recruiting members, so I went to ask for a copy of the constitution. After reading it item by item, I felt that it was indeed very economical. Therefore, I would like to introduce it to friends who love swimming. The Zhongqing Swimming Pool is located in the old clubhouse of the Chinese YMCA on Sichuan Road and is built indoors. The number of years since this swimming pool was built is quite long.</p>
<p>The Zhongqing Swimming Club, organized by the YMCA Sports Department, runs from July 1 to August 31, a full two months. The YMCA's purpose in organizing this swimming club is to unite senior swimmers and provide organized swimming training to improve swimming standards and interest. However, those who join as members must first undergo a physical examination by a doctor. People with infectious diseases and heart diseases are rejected from participating. Those who can swim freestyle, breaststroke, sidestroke, and backstroke for up to twenty yards, and who can dive and jump, can all participate.</p>
<p>The two-month training period includes advanced water safety skills and recreation, various swimming competition training, preliminary rescue techniques, various fancy diving, and various swimming performance tests. Training time is from 7:00 to 9:00 pm every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Regarding fees, YMCA members and students in swimming classes pay five yuan, adult members pay ten yuan, and non-members pay fifteen yuan. This is used to subsidize water and electricity costs.</p>
<p>However, the cost of joining the Zhongqing Swimming Club is indeed economical. The restrictions on qualifications are too strict. Not many people can swim all kinds of strokes and dive and jump. In this way, only senior swimming talents are limited to joining the club, while general beginners or those who have learned the basics cannot join. Therefore, I hope that the Zhongqing Swimming Club, in addition to recruiting senior members, can also recruit junior members separately, so that people who do not know or know little about swimming can also join the club for training, which is in line with the original purpose of promoting swimming.</p>
<h3 id="e71">"A Heart of Compassion" <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Pu Fu</p>
<p>It was time for the store to close. The clerk was opening the iron gate when, by chance, he crushed a tabby cat on it. It was struggling and wailing, and its appearance was quite pitiful. So, the attention of the entire store was drawn to it, and everyone started shouting and trying to rescue it. The result was that the manager came out, and he immediately ordered the clerk to take a long ladder to rescue it. It can be seen that "a heart of compassion" is "something everyone has."</p>
<p>However, some people were whispering, thinking that the manager's concern for the cat exceeded that for the colleagues in the store. The cost of living is gradually soaring, but the subsidy issue has not been reasonably resolved. Although the colleagues have also submitted a "petition," putting on a pitiful appearance, hoping to arouse the "heart of compassion" of those above, the result was not as fortunate as the cat's! So, complaints came: people are not as good as cats!</p>
<p>In fact, this issue is already an old tune. As early as two thousand years ago, our Master Mencius raised it in front of a monarch…</p>
<p>"Now your kindness is sufficient to reach birds and beasts, but your beneficence does not reach the people. Why is this?"</p>
<p>I don't remember how the monarch answered, and I don't know how the manager would defend himself, but as long as you can think calmly, "why is this?" is not difficult to explain. That is, there are vested interests between people, while animals are fundamentally different. This is why China has animal protection associations, but the protection of workers is still lacking. People who advocate humanitarianism will express "abuse" when they see vendors carrying chickens and ducks over the market, but they are "deaf" to the demands of their employees to improve their treatment. It is not contradictory because "the way of man is to take from what is deficient to supply what is in excess." People who advocate humanitarianism are "people," so it is not strange.</p>
<p>However, things such as strikes and work slowdowns are still being heard from time to time, and fortunately, they are resolved quickly. But this cannot be said to be "offending the superiors," because "the way of heaven" is originally to take from the excess to supplement the deficiency, and besides, this excess contains the sweat and blood of the employees.</p>
<p>At present, labor-capital relations should be built on "sharing the same boat," and this meaning is even above "a heart of compassion," and the difference between people and cats lies here.</p>
