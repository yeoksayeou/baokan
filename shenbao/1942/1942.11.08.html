<p>莫斯科七日同盟社電　斯達林昨於蘇聯革命二十五週年紀念向全國廣播演說、仍以英美應在歐洲開闢第二戰塲爲言、據稱、英美若能於年內在歐陸發動第二戰塲、必可使德國自蘇聯方面抽調六十師、並可使其同盟國抽調二十師、因而阻止德軍在東綫獲勝、埃及方面戰事、德軍被牽制者僅四師、義大利軍被牽制者十一師、蘇聯方面則有軸心軍二百四十師之衆、在上次世界大戰中、歐洲有東西二戰綫、但在此次歐戰、因無第二戰綫之故、敵我兵力成二與一之比、紅軍作戰之苦、犧牲之大、自可想像、總之、第二戰綫必須實現、此非出於我人需要之故、即在吾盟國方面亦屬必要也、至於德軍在蘇聯南部作戰計劃、目的原在包抄蘇聯軍隊、使與莫斯科隔絕、德軍向蘇聯產油區進攻、並非其主要目的、不過一種副作用而已、德軍因無後顧之憂、得以集中全力、在東綫取得一重大勝利、英美若能如上次世界大戰情形、開闢第二戰綫、則蘇聯方面戰局必能急轉直下、德在上次世界大戰、共有陸軍二百二十師、其用以對俄作戰者不過八十五師、外加匈奧聯軍二十七師、保加利亞軍三師及土耳其軍三師、今年九月、據確實紀錄德軍二百五十六師中、用以對付蘇聯者一百七十九師，外加羅馬尼亞軍二十師、芬蘭軍十四師、義大利軍十師、匈牙利軍十三師、斯洛伐克軍一師、西班牙軍一師、共計二百四十師之衆、若與拿破崙攻俄戰事相較、兵力相差亦甚遠、拿破崙攻俄大軍六十萬人、開到鮑洛定諾者不通三四萬人、開到莫斯科者亦不過此數而已、現在紅軍所與周旋者在三百萬以一、且備有最新式兵器、斯達林精論云、此次大戰中、敵我兩軍作戰目標完全相反、我人作戰方針、厥在粉碎歐洲新秩序、</p>
<p>莫斯科六日中央社電　斯達林於六日晚在此間赤色廣塲向全國發表廣播說、首先檢討過去一年間蘇聯在前綫方之成績、其言有曰、蘇維埃政府於過法一年內之活動、集中於組織國內戰綫與紅軍作戰兩方面、以言國內工業、則已遷至東部、耕種面積亦予擴大、後方勞工規律亦已強化、因內之組織可稱已臻健全、</p>
<h3 id="c16">風雲變幻中之非洲　八十名黑奴手創的里比利亞獨立國（二） <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>這地方原是英國西非的一塊小屬地，名叫塞拉勒窩內。冒險隊派了幾名代表上岸一看，覺得不對勁。一方面由於他們老鄉們太不文明，連褲子都不肯穿；一方面岸上幾位白人地主，把當地黑人牛馬不如的使喚着；想已經恢復了自由的人那裏肯再去受人鞭策？他們寗可死在海裏。</p>
<p>八十人一番討論之後，決定再往南行，情願跑到人跡不到的所在去同獅子鱷魚拚命。果然天從人願，居然被他我到了曼挪河口的一個小島，上面各種樹木花果都有，就只差人料理。八十老小就在這裏登陸，把這島題了一個名稱，叫作天堂島。</p>
<p>在這小島一面生活，一面又到對岸的大陸上去探險，於是發現曼挪河流域，確實可以大展宏圖，便遷移了一部分人過去。這裏就是密蘇拉多角，也就是現在里比利亞的首都滿羅維亞。第二年美國的黑奴聽了這個消息，心下活動了不少，一下就有男女老小二千名渡洋而來。二千名確實是個大數目，新發現的地方已經開闢的，還容納不下，於是另外組織一個團體沿海邊南下，希望找到一片足以安身立命的所在。</p>
<p>這一部分人沿路走走住住，費了十一二年光陰，（一八三三），大槪走了三百多哩，又在巴馬角的地方發現了一塊好地，就定名「非洲自立邦美麗鄕」，這塊自由區後來很興旺，到了一八五七年，方才決定歸併到里比利亞，稱爲美麗省。</p>
<p>里比利亞的名稱，是個什麼來由呢？原來在八十人發現首都滿羅維亞的第二年（一八二四）有一位傳敎師格爾雷，見道裏一片翠綠，滿地花菓，靈感一到，於是就定了這個名稱Liberia，這字的前五個字母拼合起來，就是法語「自由」的意思。（照音讀，應譯爲「徠貝利亞」，亦可免與義國屬地里比亞混淆）。</p>
<p>其實，這塊地也並不算自由黑奴的新發現。在十四世紀就有一個葡萄牙的探險家到過這裏，並且繪了一張地圖，所以到現在沿用的許多老地名都是葡萄牙字音。十五世紀也有葡萄商人來過，到了十六世紀，英，荷，德，法，的探險團，接踵而來，反而把最初發現此地的葡人趕跑了。</p>
<p>自從自由黑人到了里比利亞後，每年都陸續有黑人從美國移來，最多的一次有三千多名。二十五年之內，在天堂島和首都道一方面的人大都受着英人的管理，在美麗自由鄕的，才是眞正自治團體。</p>
<p>到了一八四一年最後一任的白人官死了，就有一位傑出人才，是一個道地的黑種，名叫羅伯茲，登台上任。這時里比利亞還不算一個國，又不是任何國的正式殖民地，就算一個黑奴自由區罷。可是因爲沒有一個正式名義，一切事務都不好辦理。尤其可惡的，是區界邊境上，常常有英法殖民地的衝突，常常有交涉，也常常鬧一回大打出手。此外，本自由區內，有不少的土人種族，常常也要給他們找麻煩。一年到頭，天天有這一類的事悄發生。</p>
<p>黑人領袖羅伯茲，雖說不是那先驅八十人中的一份子，但確實是八十八中之一的家屬。他在美國烟葉最馳名的維金尼亞省黑人大學讀書卒業；雖說不是專門人才，著名的學者，但在學問和知識上，確不愧爲自由區全區的領袖人物。至於精神魄力，雄才大略，確是超人一等。</p>
<p>自由區有了這樣一位了不得的人物，又抓住了適當的機會，上了政治舞台，當然是要天大發揮一下。起首六個年頭之內，所有的精力，完全是安內攘外。安內，是降服了好幾個爲首的大部落蠻族，叫他們歸順。攘外，完全是向英法屬地的宗國直接交涉。</p>
<p>到了一八四七年，一切政務和外交部辦得不差什麼了，於是平地一聲雷，宣佈自由區正式成立里比利亞公和國。一切的政務組織和法度，都仿照美國辦理；同時起草了一篇慷慨激昂的立國宣言；大意譯述如后：</p>
<p>吾等里比利亞國民俱係原先北美合衆國之國民。</p>
<p>吾等在該國爲民時期，在某地區內，乃不能獲人類應有之權益；在其他某地區，其較法律尤有權威之民情，乃劣視吾人至於極度。</p>
<p>各地凡稱爲文明之塲所，乃將吾人擯諸門外。</p>
<p>一切行政，乃無吾人參加餘地。</p>
<p>抽稅納糧，不容吾人置喙。</p>
<p>吾人橫被壓迫，納獻出產，乃無絲毫國家的保護。</p>
<p>吾人被區別成一特殊民族，所有之改進，吾人無權享受，而其他外來民族與吾人膚色不同者，反得事事優先。</p>
<p>吾人一再伸訴，乃不予理會，或竟以特殊組織爲托辭。</p>
<p>吾人工切希望，終乃幻滅；懸於吾人前途者，惟有墮落。</p>
<p>自登非洲海岸以來，吾人乃得自由欣賞一綫光明之前途，希望吾人能發揮天賦人類之人格；懷育吾人誠意向上之一腔烈火：發展創造者賦予吾人之靈感；向素日卑視，蔑笑，壓迫吾人者，表示吾人與彼等乃同一圓顱方趾，同一天賦；同樣能獲得文質彬彬之休養，同樣能獲得裝飾所謂高尙人類之進化……。</p>

<p>英文泰晤士報云、頃據記者調查所知、市政當局雖訂有各項條例、而貿易公會亦圖遏制囤積罪惡、然糖油米肉囤積居奇之風、仍未稍戢、故上海市民現要求當局立刻採取嚴厲行動、俾完全肅淸食物之黑市活動、</p>
<p>囤積暴利　應予嚴懲</p>
<p>上海各報、無論華文·日文·英文與俄文、均明瞭市民所遭遇情勢之嚴重、乃一致爲取締囤積暴利運動聲援、並指出當局須有迅速而嚴厲之行動、以防各物投機之風加熾、若干人士且主張對囤積暴利者、應處以極重之懲罰、同時改組目下之食物分配制度、使之適應現時需要、據一般意見、最重要之改組步驟、厥爲樹立計口授給制、以分配各種食品、警方刻正密切注視統制食品之問題、而當局有何統制食品之布告、公衆均表示歡迎、</p>
<p>黑市活動　迄未稍戢</p>
<p>查本年初、中外市民對當局計口授給米·麵粉·麵包與牛油之計劃、尚多猜疑、今則極望一切日用品俱以計口授給制度分配之、米糖油肉等物之買賣、發現黑市活動、已引起公衆之重大關切、當局雖竭力推行低價政策、然食品之黑市價、不斷高漲、且糖與油已感匱乏、迄今爲止、糖與油之配給、乃由上海糖商合作營業處與油商批發處分別辦理糖之情勢、自本月初以來、未見好轉、至於素油、則油商批發處現正採取强硬手段、以防素油交易、發生同樣情形、</p>
<p>食油供應　何至缺乏</p>
<p>據記者昨日（六日）所晤之各方人士聲稱、即使當局派給最低量之糖與油、亦較目下之食糖分配、必須列隊候購半磅之辦法爲佳、過去兩週來、華字報紙日載食物黑市價格之消息、例如滬寗鐵路一帶米價爲二百五十元、上海米價則增三倍（計口授計之米不在此例）、據消息靈通人士聲稱、素油每日分配一千擔、不特足應兩租界居民之需、且可供西區與浦東居民之合法需用、上海油店約二千家、內的四百家有從事投機之嫌疑、致油價提高、此輩黑市投機者、現已有若干家不　派得素油、</p>
<p>澈底統制　計口授給</p>
<p>至於食糖、上海糖商合作營業處雖屢次宣布存底充足、然囤積居奇者、賡續活動、公衆則未能獲得日常所需之糖、以言肉類、當局會於十月十一日發表限價、然伙食店與攤販售肉時遵守限價者、寥寥無幾、約六週前豬肉市况、頗形惡劣、嗣稍見改善、但未完全好轉、而牛羊肉之市價、亦公然高於限價、奸商旣蔑視官方條例、公衆乃更迫切要求對於一切食物、均施以澈底統制之計口授給制、</p>

<p>冷天是窮苦的同胞最感受威脅的季節，他們饑寒交迫，要謀生存，實在是很困難的，這一點只要看每年街頭凍死的人數統計，就可以證明。</p>
<p>我們曾經在今年度過一個酷熱的暑天，預料一定有一個奇寒的冷天，想起了一般窮苦的同胞，不覺爲他們躭憂，因爲同情心是每人都有的。</p>
<p>然而沒有組織的救濟也有相當弊病的，現在有一個機會，可以使我們盡一點人類互助的責任，因爲女靑年會，正在發起徵募寒衣運動，有五種方法，可以參加，我們除了出錢或者出力之外，尙可以把無用的舊衣舊襪交到女靑年會去。</p>
<p>在顧到自身過冬的種種準備之餘，兼能參加寒衣運動，可說是當前最有意義的工作。</p>

<p>— 徐百益譯</p>
<p>葛賴亨先生的兒子，再度獲得了升級的機會，他從開帳員升到了旅行推銷員的職位，而起程到外埠去了，葛賴亨先生在送行的那天所得到的印象並不佳妙，所以立刻寫信給予他許一多忠告，這種忠告，在普通一般人，知道葛賴亨先生的兒子是公司小主人的地位，決不會給予他，而他的父親能够拋開父子的私情，以公司爲前提而痛快的說個明白，對於他是非常寶貴的。</p>
<p>第十封　經商之道親愛的兒子：</p>
<p>當我在昨天看你出發開始旅行的時候，我實在有一些不安，因爲你顯得非常神氣，好像你現在是全公司最重要的人物。但是你要知道我們所需要的是定單而不是對外職員的神氣活現。</p>
<p>臘腸是我們公司中主要出品之一，因此就應該很愼重的去規劃一切，在上星期中，臘腸部的主任建議在臘腸上面加一張鉛質的牌子，我立刻加以阻止，因為那樣一來，就無形中成爲一種商標了，將來在出售的時候，要平添許多麻煩。這一點就可以證明我們辦事的審愼。</p>
<p>我希望你在你的頭腦裏牢牢地記住，這一次的旅行多少是一個試騐，你的是否能　成功，完全要看你自己的努力如何。一個眞正的推銷員是十分之一的說話和十分之九的判斷力，他應該利用十分之九的判斷力，去判斷什麼時候去用那十分之一的說話。有許多推銷員，都以爲進貨員所感覺興趣的是棒球，有趣的故事，而做生意還是屬於次要的地位，然而能够做到進貨員的的職位人，決不能聽聽笑話就成功的。</p>
<p>當然啦，你待人接物，能够和藹是最好，但過分的和藹，就成爲無用了。一個眞正精明的進貨員，除了我們貨品的質料和價錢之外，對於其他的事，並不會感到興趣，你不必向同業讓步，但不必訴說他們的缺點，你不心跪下來去懇求定單，也不能將你的鼻子抬得過高。在你旅行的時候，一定會遇見許多你並不喜歡的人物，但那些人正是可以與公司發生營業關係的。</p>
<p>如果你要做一個頭等的推銷員，你應該以下列三點爲目標：（一）將定單寄到公司，（二）繼續寄更多的定單，（三）寄價值更大的定單。你能够做到這三點，那末你決沒有時間去寫很長的信，而且我們也決沒有時間續很長的信，因爲我們將忙於製造和寄發貨品了。我們對於別人所獲得的定單，並不感到興趣，所以萬一被別人搶去了定單以後，你也不必來報告公司，因爲最妥當的辦法，當然是不被別人搶去生意，最好的辦法就是每天把你的住址和定單寄到公司來，這樣我們就可以知道你的一切動態了了、</p>
<p>以前我曾經代表一家公司到埃及開羅去推銷服裝用品，我到了那裏，在初次與新環境接觸，就以爲很有推銷的可能，將來的營業，一定可以成功。然而推銷的結果，並不如理想的那末美滿，因此我就時常寫信給總公司，報告失敗的原因和怎樣被同業爭去生意的詳情，結果總公司來了一個電報，電文是：「我們知道同業的一切動態，他們獲得了全部的營業，但是你在做些什麼？」那時候我立刻明白，再解釋也沒有什麼用處，惟有提出辭職，所以就把辭職信發出，現在我們對於你也抱着同一態度，等待着你的定單或是辭職信。</p>
<p>你的摯愛的父親葛賴亨。</p>

<p>— 路琦</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友：</p>
<p>時光過得眞快，嚴寒的冬天又將到臨了，小朋友們一定也很不高興冬天的來臨的罷？因爲天太冷了，手指會凍得僵紅，而且媽媽是不會允許你出去玩的，但是，小朋友，你有沒有看見馬路上許多窮困的孩子嗎，他們穿着一件薄薄的衣服，在路上奔走工作着，肚子又餓，身上父冷，他們和你同樣是好孩子，他們的媽媽也是愛他們的，但是，他們太窮了，爲了生活，他們不得不冒着風雪工作着。</p>
<p>前天，我走過虞洽卿路，看見許多人圍着一個荷包這兒躺着一個死的孩子，孩子痙攣地露出一個恐怖的小臉。唉，小朋友，我難過極了，你看，這孩子一點也沒有錯就這樣的死了。</p>
<p>在這嚴寒的冬天，小朋友們，又不知將有許多窮苦的孩子凍死餓死，人是應該互助的，現在已經有女靑年會發起幫助這許多苦兒的寒衣運動。小朋友你願意不願意也節省一點糖果錢來帮助這許多苦孩子嗎？我們希望你同你的爸爸媽媽一同節省着來給這許多苦孩子縫製棉衣。</p>

<p>「衣服的縫製和分發」是合乎救濟性質的，我們將利用一般失業的婦女來縫製，在按件計工的原則下可以對於她們的生活略有補助，此外，我們更將請我們的會員和社會上熱心的人士，共同來分担這種縫製的工作，至於寒衣的分發也是很嚴格的領取寒衣一定要經過可靠機關或個人的介紹而經本會調查確屬需要的人始能核准發給。</p>
<p>「寒衣委員會執行工作」以上一切關於寒衣的捐款，縫製和分發等工作，均有本會寒衣委員會執行推進，捐款賬目和救濟人數，將來可以在報端公開發表。</p>

<p>— 星也</p>
<p>我們每次領了麵粉，總是做些麵餅；麵疙瘩吃。未免生厭。想做饅頭，又不懂如何發酵。某次在米店裏領麵粉，順便買一塊新亞酵母，拿了一張說明書，回去試做，居然很好。現在把我的經騐寫在下面，以供參考。</p>
<p>先把酵母一塊，在微溫水裏溶化調勻，加糖少許。然後稱二斤麪粉，放在磁盆裏，拿溶化的水慢慢倒下，隨倒隨搓，揑成一個柔軟的麪團，上面把潮毛巾蓋好，放在溫暖的地方（如爐子附近等），這就等他發酵了。</p>
<p>三小時以後，再去看看，麪團已經漲大一倍有餘，我非常驚異，認爲這種酵母的確不錯。隨即做成一個個饅頭，排在檯上（檯上先要灑些乾麪粉）上面仍把潮毛巾蓋好。因爲如不蓋好，饅頭吹了風，要起硬皮，就不會鬆軟了。</p>
<p>這時候把鍋子蒸籠（或蒸架）預備好。籠裏墊了濕布，先用强火隔水煮沸。再把做好的饅頭排入籠裏，大約蒸十幾分鐘，熱汽直綫上騰，饅頭就好了。我吃着自己做成鬆軟的饅頭，心中愉快，眞非筆墨可以形容呢。</p>
<p>讀者如有興趣，不妨也做來換換口味，好在新亞酵母在米店和食品店裏，都有出賣的。（廣告）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Announcement from the Japanese Imperial Headquarters: Recent Naval Battle Results - Over 250,000 Tons of Enemy Ships Sunk <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Domei News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM today that Japanese warships had sunk 21 enemy submarines from late July to late October. During the same period, the Japanese Navy sank 34 enemy ships, totaling 252,400 tons. The Japanese side only lost two submarines. The Japanese Imperial Headquarters also admitted that the Japanese side lost 29 merchant ships, totaling 122,500 tons, during the three months. According to military observers in Tokyo, as reported by Domei News Agency on the 7th, the Japanese military results announced by the Imperial Headquarters this afternoon included the sinking of 21 enemy submarines and 24 enemy ships, totaling 252,400 tons. Combined with the Japanese Navy's battle results since the start of the war, a total of 89 British and American submarines have been sunk and 39 damaged, totaling 128. In addition, a total of 391 ships have been sunk or damaged, approximately 220,000 tons. It is expected that most of the enemy submarines sunk in this announcement belong to the United States. Therefore, it can be estimated that the U.S. submarines have lost about 60 ships since the start of the war. Thus, most of the U.S. submarines in the Pacific have been lost, and those that remain are restricted by the Japanese Navy's control of the sea. Therefore, it will be impossible for the United States to implement a commerce raiding war in the Greater East Asia area. Most of the ships lost by Japan are transport ships in combat, and the loss of ships engaged in commerce is extremely minimal. From this, it can be seen that the Japanese army has established a strong and complete defense line in the Greater East Asia area against enemy submarine attacks. In the future, U.S. Navy submarines will have no room to be active under the power of the Japanese Navy. In addition, the number of enemy ships sunk by the Japanese Navy since the start of the war has reached 391, approximately 220,000 tons. Although this number is still small compared to the battle results of the German and Italian navies, the waters in which the Japanese Navy operates are much wider than those in which the German and Italian navies operate. The purpose of the Shanghai Naval operation is mainly to destroy the British and American maritime forces, and the commerce raiding war has no important position. Therefore, the focus of the Japanese Navy's operational goals is completely different from that of the German and Italian navies. Since the start of the war, the overall battle results of Japanese submarines have been very significant. The surprise attacks by submarines on Pearl Harbor, Sydney Harbor, and Madagascar, as well as the sinking of the USS Wasp and USS Hornet aircraft carriers by Japanese submarines, are all important battle results.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - The Sino-Japanese Joint Celebration Night, sponsored by the Propaganda Department and the Japanese Embassy, was held at the Grand China Theater at 7:30 PM today. Minister Lin personally attended and delivered a speech. The main idea was: "Tonight, the Japanese Embassy and the Propaganda Department are holding a celebration party here. I am deeply grateful for the enthusiastic participation of all officials and people from all walks of life. Originally, during the war, it is time for us to shed blood and sweat, not for singing and dancing. The reason why we are celebrating today is not for singing and dancing, but for another important meaning. First, today is the eighth anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. In the past year, the brave soldiers of the Allied Powers have achieved an absolute victory in the Greater East Asia War. This victory is not only the glory of the Allied Powers, but also the glory of the entire East Asia. We have today's celebration to show the bright future of East Asia to the people of both countries. Second, with the progress of the Greater East Asia War and the collapse of the Anglo-American aggressive forces, the success of the peace movement is determined. However, to win a thorough victory, we still need the continuous efforts and joint cooperation of the two major nations of China and Japan. We have today's celebration to continue our past efforts. We have today's celebration to step up our future cooperation. Third, the chairman often tells us that to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War, the people of East Asia must share weal and woe. To complete the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the people of East Asia must love each other. During the war, we don't need to ask how to share weal in the future, but only ask how to share woe now. Only by being able to share woe can we talk about sharing weal. We have today's celebration with this spirit. Based on the above three points, we want to express our infinite respect to the heroic soldiers of the Greater East Asia War. We want to express our infinite sympathy to the majority of hardworking and resilient people. We must have the same brave and diligent spirit as the soldiers to fight. We must have the same hardworking and resilient spirit as the people to work hard. We must expand today's celebration in continuous efforts and continuous struggles, and make it a grand celebration held simultaneously by 550 million people in China and Japan."</p>

<h3 id="e6">East of Mersa Matruh, German and Italian Forces Counterattacked Several Times: Armored Forces on Both Sides Fiercely Engaged; Genoa, Italy Bombed the Night Before Last <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Domei News Agency) - Fierce fighting continues east of Mersa Matruh in Egypt. German General Rommel and British General Alexander's armored forces are fiercely engaged. Although the Axis forces have been subjected to fierce attacks by British tanks and infantry, they are still maintaining an unbroken line. The British side claims that the Axis forces have been driven back, while here it is announced that the Axis heavy bomber squadrons have continuously bombed the British motorized units between Mersa Matruh and El Alamein, inflicting heavy damage. Informed sources here say that the British claim that a large amount of German and Italian military equipment has been destroyed and captured is absurd. General Rommel is withdrawing from the El Alamein positions according to a pre-determined plan. When the German army withdrew from the old positions on the nights of November 3rd and 4th, only unusable war equipment, heavy artillery, and other military equipment were left behind. The artillery had been moved to the new positions to bombard the British army. The Axis forces are still outnumbered on land and in the air, so reinforcements have begun to arrive. There are no continuous lines on the current front. The fighting is currently taking place along a 60-mile front from north to south.</p>
<p>Fuhrer Headquarters, 7th (DNB) - Today's German military report states that fierce fighting continues in Egypt. German and Italian troops counterattacked, inflicting heavy losses on enemy tank formations. German and Italian air forces in batches attacked enemy mechanized units between Mersa Matruh and El Alamein. The anti-aircraft guns of German warships shot down five enemy aircraft in the Mediterranean in recent days. A few British planes, under cover of floating clouds, flew into western Germany and harbors yesterday during the day. The damage to the people was very small. Six enemy aircraft were shot down.</p>
<p>Rome, 7th (DNB) - Today's Italian military headquarters communique states that operations continued yesterday east of Mersa Matruh. The Axis forces counterattacked several times, inflicting heavy damage on enemy tanks. Our aircraft attacked the airfields on Malta several times last night. British aircraft bombed Genoa last night, causing greater damage to the eastern part of the city. Twenty civilians were killed and fifty were injured. However, the general public observed discipline and the order was quite good. Only one enemy bomber was shot down.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 6th (Domei News Agency) - Regarding the fighting in North Africa, the London military believes that the first phase of the large-scale offensive launched by General Alexander has come to an end. It will take some time to see how it develops in the future. Since the battle has changed from trench warfare to mobile warfare, General Rommel has been known as an expert in mobile warfare in the Axis countries. Therefore, the final outcome should be judged carefully and not be too optimistic. Moreover, although the British army has won, the German and Italian forces on the Egyptian front have not completely collapsed, and their retreat is a planned one.</p>

<p>London, 6th (Havas) - According to semi-official sources, the Axis countries are currently sending a large number of reinforcements to North Africa. In addition to multiple trains full of troops seen in Greece, troops are also about to depart from Sicily and Genoa in Italy. It is estimated that the strength of all the reinforcements is at least four divisions.</p>
<p>Berlin, 7th (DNB) - German military figures pointed out that the German and Italian air forces are able to continuously bomb North Africa, which proves that fresh troops have flown in to help. But we cannot assume that the German and Italian air forces have gained the upper hand in Egypt, because there are more British planes than ever before. It is estimated that the British Eighth Army is larger than the British army that went to France in 1940. However, the British claim that the Allied forces in North Africa number no less than one million is doubtful.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 7th (DNB) - According to British sources in London, the fighting in the El Daba area is still going on. This morning's news from Cairo states that the British army has occupied the landing place of Fuka. It is reported that the landing place of El Daba has also been occupied. The British army has also crossed the El Daba defense line. Military circles in Cairo believe that Marshal Rommel has built two defense lines in the past two months to protect Libya. The first line of defense starts east of Mersa Matruh, passes through the Libyan plain, and reaches the Siwa Oasis. The second line of defense is based on the Halfaya Pass and extends to the south of the Siwa Oasis.</p>

<p>Fuhrer Headquarters, 7th (DNB) - Today's German military report states that in the western Caucasus, our army launched a surprise attack and repelled the enemy on a certain high ground. German infantry north of Tuapse made progress in the rain. East of Alagir, the enemy counterattacked several times. German aircraft destroyed 30 Soviet tanks and an armored train. German reconnaissance bombers attacked Soviet troops advancing along the Georgian Military Road. There were only local battles in the Stalingrad area. Our dive bombers attacked enemy artillery positions east of the Volga River. Our suicide squads destroyed many enemy bunkers in the central sector. German aircraft bombed enemy concentrations in the Volga River and Vinnitsa River areas.</p>
<p>Rome, 7th (Havas) - According to reports here, the resistance of the Soviet army in the Terek area of the Caucasus has been strengthened, and fresh troops are constantly arriving. Special forces are busy building fortifications at night.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 7th (Havas) - The German-Soviet war has lasted 72 weeks, and there are no major changes. In the Stalingrad area, a large number of German reinforcements have arrived in recent days, and the air force has also stepped up bombing. Street fighting in the city is still very fierce, but there are no large-scale battles on either side.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 7th (DNB) - London formally announced yesterday that the British High Command has agreed to an armistice with the French Governor-General of Madagascar. An official statement issued here states that the War Office announces that at the request of the French Governor-General of Madagascar, hostilities ceased at 2:00 PM on November 5th. The armistice agreement has been signed by both sides, and the battle of Madagascar has come to a smooth end.</p>
<p>Vichy, 6th (Havas) - The French Cabinet held a state council meeting today, chaired by Marshal Petain. The head of government, Laval, reported on the course of the fighting on the island of Madagascar and explained the difficulties faced by the island's garrison, saying, "The French army on the island has fought to the last breath, but the greatness of their spirit of sacrifice has been fully demonstrated and is worthy of the respect and admiration of the people across the country." After the meeting, officials confirmed that hostilities on the island of Madagascar had ceased and that negotiations for an armistice agreement had begun.</p>
<p>Vichy, 6th (Havas) - The French garrison on the island of Madagascar was in dire straits and had no choice but to request an armistice.

<h3 id="e15">Stalin's Radio Address on the Anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution - Strongly Argues that Britain and the United States Should Open a Second Front and Explains the Goals of the Current War Against Germany <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Moscow, 7th (Domei News Agency) - In a radio address to the nation yesterday on the 25th anniversary of the Soviet Revolution, Stalin again argued that Britain and the United States should open a second front in Europe. He said that if Britain and the United States could launch a second front on the European continent within the year, they would be able to draw 60 German divisions from the Soviet side and 20 divisions from their allies, thereby preventing the German army from winning on the Eastern Front. In the Egyptian sector, only four divisions of the German army are being restrained and 11 divisions of the Italian army, while the Soviet side has a total of 240 divisions of the Axis forces. In the last world war, there were two fronts in Europe, east and west, but in this European war, there is no second front, so the ratio of enemy and our forces is two to one. The suffering of the Red Army and the magnitude of the sacrifices can be imagined. In short, the second front must be realized, not because of our needs, but also because it is necessary for our allies. As for the German plan to fight in southern Soviet Union, the original goal was to encircle the Soviet army and isolate it from Moscow. The German army's attack on the Soviet oil-producing areas was not its main goal, but only a side effect. Because the German army has no worries, it can concentrate all its forces and win a major victory on the Eastern Front. If Britain and the United States could open a second front as in the last world war, the situation on the Soviet side would definitely take a sharp turn for the better. In the last world war, Germany had a total of 220 army divisions, of which only 85 divisions were used to fight against Russia, plus 27 divisions of the Austro-Hungarian army, three divisions of the Bulgarian army, and three divisions of the Turkish army. In September this year, according to accurate records, of the 256 German divisions, 179 divisions were used to deal with the Soviet Union, plus 20 divisions of the Romanian army, 14 divisions of the Finnish army, 10 divisions of the Italian army, 13 divisions of the Hungarian army, one division of the Slovak army, and one division of the Spanish army, totaling 240 divisions. Compared with Napoleon's invasion of Russia, the strength of the forces is also very different. Napoleon invaded Russia with an army of 600,000 people, and no more than 300,000 to 400,000 people reached Borodino, and no more than this number reached Moscow. Now the Red Army is dealing with more than three million people and is equipped with the latest weapons. Stalin elaborated that the goals of the enemy and our armies in this war are completely opposite. Our operational policy is to crush the new order in Europe.</p>
<p>Moscow, 6th (Central News Agency) - Stalin delivered a radio address to the nation at Red Square here on the evening of the 6th, first reviewing the achievements of the Soviet Union on the front line in the past year. He said, "The activities of the Soviet government in the past year have focused on organizing the domestic front and the Red Army's operations. In terms of domestic industry, it has been moved to the east, the area of cultivation has also been expanded, and the discipline of rear workers has also been strengthened. Therefore, the organization within the country can be said to be sound."</p>
<h3 id="e16">Africa in the Midst of Shifting Winds: The Independent Nation of Liberia, Founded by Eighty Freed Slaves (Part 2) <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>This place was originally a small British West African territory called Sierra Leone. The expedition team sent a few representatives ashore to take a look, but they felt something was amiss. On the one hand, their fellow countrymen were too uncivilized, refusing even to wear trousers; on the other hand, the white landowners on shore were treating the local black people worse than animals; those who had already regained their freedom were certainly unwilling to be whipped again. They would rather die in the sea.</p>
<p>After a discussion among the eighty people, they decided to sail further south, willing to go to a place where no one had set foot and fight for their lives against lions and crocodiles. As fate would have it, they found a small island at the mouth of the Mano River, which had all kinds of trees, flowers, and fruits, only lacking human care. The eighty people, old and young, landed here and named the island Paradise Island.</p>
<p>While living on this small island, they also explored the mainland across the river, and discovered that the Mano River basin could indeed be a place for great achievements, so they moved a portion of the people there. This is the Mesurado Cape, which is now the capital of Liberia, Monrovia. The following year, the black slaves in the United States heard this news and were greatly encouraged, and two thousand men, women, and children crossed the ocean to come. Two thousand was indeed a large number, and the newly discovered place, even after being developed, could not accommodate them all, so another group was organized to head south along the coast, hoping to find a place where they could settle down.</p>
<p>This group of people walked and lived along the way, spending eleven or twelve years (1833), roughly walking more than three hundred miles, and found a good piece of land at Cape Palmas, which they named "Maryland in Africa." This free area later prospered, and in 1857, it was finally decided to merge into Liberia and be called Maryland County.</p>
<p>What is the origin of the name Liberia? It turns out that in the second year after the eighty people discovered the capital Monrovia (1824), a missionary named Gurley saw that the area was lush and green, with flowers and fruits everywhere, and with inspiration, he named it Liberia. The first five letters of the word spell "liber" in French, which means "free." (Phonetically, it should be translated as "Lai Bei Li Ya" to avoid confusion with the Italian territory of Libya).</p>
<p>In fact, this land was not exactly a new discovery by free black slaves. In the fourteenth century, a Portuguese explorer had been here and drawn a map, so many of the old place names still in use today are of Portuguese origin. In the fifteenth century, Portuguese merchants also came, and in the sixteenth century, exploration teams from England, the Netherlands, Germany, and France came one after another, driving away the Portuguese who had first discovered the area.</p>
<p>Since the free black people arrived in Liberia, black people have continued to migrate from the United States every year, with the largest number being more than three thousand. Within twenty-five years, most of the people on Paradise Island and in the capital were under the management of the British, while those in the free area of Maryland were truly self-governing.</p>
<p>In 1841, when the last white official died, an outstanding talent, a pure black man named Roberts, took office. At this time, Liberia was not yet a country, nor was it an official colony of any country; it was just a free area for black slaves. But because it did not have an official name, it was difficult to handle all affairs. What was especially hateful was that there were often conflicts between the British and French colonies on the borders of the area, often involving negotiations, and often breaking out into fights. In addition, within this free area, there were many indigenous tribes who often caused trouble for them. Throughout the year, things like this happened every day.</p>
<p>The black leader Roberts, although not one of the original eighty pioneers, was indeed a member of one of their families. He graduated from the black university in Virginia, the state best known for its tobacco; although he was not a specialized talent or a famous scholar, he was indeed worthy of being the leader of the entire free area in terms of learning and knowledge. As for his spirit, courage, and great talent, he was indeed extraordinary.</p>
<p>The free area had such an incredible figure, and seized the right opportunity to enter the political arena, so of course he was going to make a big difference. In the first six years, all his energy was devoted to internal stability and external resistance. Internal stability meant subduing several leading barbarian tribes and getting them to submit. External resistance meant directly negotiating with the colonial powers of England and France.</p>
<p>In 1847, everything was handled quite well in terms of political affairs and foreign affairs, so with a thunderclap from the ground, the free area officially declared the establishment of the Republic of Liberia. All political organizations and laws were modeled after the United States; at the same time, a passionate declaration of independence was drafted; a rough translation of the main points is as follows:</p>
<p>We, the citizens of Liberia, are all originally citizens of the United States of North America.</p>
<p>During our time as citizens of that country, in certain regions, we were unable to obtain the rights that human beings should have; in other regions, the customs of the people, which had more power than the law, looked down on us to the extreme.</p>
<p>Everywhere that calls itself a place of civilization, we are excluded.</p>
<p>We have no say in any administration.</p>
<p>We are not allowed to express our opinions on taxation and levies.</p>
<p>We are oppressed horizontally, and although we offer our products, we receive no national protection.</p>
<p>We are distinguished as a special ethnic group, and we have no right to enjoy any improvements, while other foreign ethnic groups with different skin colors from us are given priority in everything.</p>
<p>We have repeatedly appealed, but have been ignored, or even dismissed on the pretext of special organizations.</p>
<p>Our hard work and hope have finally been shattered; what hangs before our future is only depravity.</p>
<p>Since landing on the coast of Africa, we have been able to freely admire a glimmer of light in our future, hoping that we can develop the personality of human beings endowed by nature; nurture our sincere and upwardly mobile fire; develop the inspiration given to us by the creator; and show those who have always looked down on, mocked, and oppressed us that we are the same round-headed, square-footed beings, with the same natural gifts; and that we can also obtain the cultivation of a refined nature, and also obtain the evolution that decorates so-called noble human beings....</p>

<h3 id="e17">Authorities Determined to Suppress Commodity Prices. Public Announcement Addressed to Citizens. Calling for Citizen Cooperation and Encouraging Production, Discouraging Speculation and Excessive Profits in Order to Stabilize Prices. <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement and the French Municipal Council jointly issued a public announcement addressed to citizens regarding commodity price controls. It stated, "Now, in order to stabilize commodity prices and ensure the well-being of the people, we specially call on citizens to cooperate. Although the authorities can find ways to control commodity prices, this matter requires the cooperation and understanding of citizens to be effective. The harms of rising commodity prices are well known to the public. If the trend of rising prices is not curbed, not only will the wage-earning class experience great difficulties, but the economic foundation of this city will also be shaken. Whenever commodity prices rise beyond the affordability of the general wage-earning class, social and physical harms will follow, and their impact will be obvious. Therefore, the rise in commodity prices, if not checked, will always be a source of social unrest."</p>
<p>Credit Loans; Encouraging Production</p>
<p>The true key point of our research into economic problems is the purchasing power of money. Therefore, our actions must be determined by whether their impact can increase or decrease the purchasing power of money. When commodity prices rise, the purchasing power of money decreases. For example, if a person has 1,000 yuan to buy goods, and the price of the goods doubles, their money will also double to 2,000 yuan. But at this time, the 2,000 yuan they obtain has the same purchasing power as the previous 1,000 yuan, or even less. On the authorities' side, there are currently plans for various methods, such as credit loans, limited to production enterprises, and encouraging major industries, etc., to improve the situation.</p>
<p>Focus on Investment; Do Not Engage in Speculation</p>
<p>On the citizens' side, the following items can also be implemented for cooperation: (1) focus on the operation of production enterprises; (2) individual purchases should be limited to practical and essential items; (3) do not hoard any goods; (4) rather than engaging in the distribution of manufactured products, focus on investing in genuine production enterprises; (5) do not engage in speculation in goods and stocks to seek excessive profits; (6) carefully study various investments based on the previous ratio of dividends and profits, and do not rely on impressions and rumors. Before investing, you should also carefully check the company's balance sheet and profit and loss statement. If citizens can implement the above methods, not only will rising commodity prices be suppressed, but also the wealth they already possess and will obtain in the future will be protected.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Department has finalized an order for 500 tons (equivalent to 10,000 dan). In addition, retail stores began selling their stock yesterday. Such lines can be seen at edible oil stores on Xiamen Road, Fujian Road, Tiantong Road, and Baker Road. Therefore, citizens do not seem to need to worry excessively about edible oil at present.</p>
<p>Oil Purchase Certificates; Suspended This Month</p>
<p>The Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Department, regarding the item "Restaurants and Wine Shops Receive Oil Purchase Certificates" published in various newspapers yesterday, stated to the Datong News Agency reporter with great emphasis that, as there are discrepancies with the facts, in order to avoid misunderstandings from the outside world, the issuance of oil purchase certificates for restaurants and wine shops began several months ago. Starting this month, due to the insufficient supply of edible oil, the authorities of the wholesale department issued a notice temporarily suspending the issuance.</p>
<p>500 Tons of Oil; Scheduled for Distribution</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Department, the 500 tons of edible oil that has been finalized has made headway in moving permits. It is expected that it will be distributed to retail stores for sale next Tuesday or Wednesday. However, in order to avoid hoarding and creating black markets, the initial distribution volume is temporarily set at 1,000 to 2,000 dan.</p>

<p>Since the highest air defense authority in this city announced that large-scale blackout exercises would be held again starting on the 8th of this month, all districts of the city have paid close attention and have held local exercises one after another. Yesterday, for the sake of caution, the Lianbao chiefs of the two concessions issued notices separately, with roughly similar wording. It is noted that the large-scale air defense exercise in this city will be held again starting tomorrow, or warning exercises may be held at any time without prior notice. Therefore, residents must pay attention to the sound of the air raid siren at all times, and pay extra attention to covering up all lights. The police authorities have dispatched detectives to patrol in sections, and residents who violate the rules will be severely punished.</p>

The former is filled with photographs of Soviet leaders and the country's war efforts, as well as texts commemorating this great Soviet holiday. The White Russian newspaper has a large headline, "Day of Sorrow for Russians," and the entire page of the White Russian Shanghai "Chara" newspaper is surrounded by a thick black border and contains anti-Soviet texts, such as the assassination of Tsar Nicholas II and his family.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Exorbitant Black Market Profits Have Yet to Be Curtailed; Thorough Elimination Is Urgently Needed; Swift and Severe Action Is Required to Prevent the Resurgence of Speculation in Various Commodities <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Times" reports that, according to a recent investigation by reporters, although the municipal authorities have enacted various regulations and trade associations are attempting to curb the evils of hoarding, the trend of hoarding and speculation in sugar, oil, rice, and meat has not yet been curtailed. Therefore, the citizens of Shanghai are now demanding that the authorities take immediate and severe action to completely eliminate black market activities in food.</p>
<p>Hoarding and Excessive Profits; Should Be Severely Punished</p>
<p>All Shanghai newspapers, whether Chinese, Japanese, English, or Russian, are clearly aware of the seriousness of the situation faced by citizens and are unanimously supporting the movement to crack down on hoarding and excessive profits, and pointing out that the authorities must take swift and severe action to prevent the intensification of speculation in various commodities. Some people even advocate that hoarders and profiteers should be punished with the utmost severity, and at the same time, the current food distribution system should be reorganized to adapt to current needs. According to general opinion, the most important reorganization step is to establish a per capita rationing system to distribute various foods. The police are currently closely monitoring the issue of controlled foods, and the public welcomes any announcements by the authorities regarding controlled foods.</p>
<p>Black Market Activities; Have Yet to Be Curtailed</p>
<p>At the beginning of this year, Chinese and foreign citizens were still suspicious of the authorities' plan to ration rice, flour, bread, and butter per capita. Now, they are eager for all daily necessities to be distributed through a per capita rationing system. The discovery of black market activities in the buying and selling of items such as rice, sugar, oil, and meat has aroused serious concern among the public. Although the authorities are making every effort to promote a low-price policy, the black market prices of food are constantly rising, and sugar and oil are already in short supply. So far, the rationing of sugar and oil has been handled separately by the Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative and the Oil Merchants Wholesale Department. The situation of sugar has not improved since the beginning of this month. As for vegetable oil, the Oil Merchants Wholesale Department is now taking strong measures to prevent the same situation from occurring in vegetable oil transactions.</p>
<p>Why Is There a Shortage of Edible Oil?</p>
<p>According to people from all walks of life interviewed by reporters yesterday (the 6th), even if the authorities allocate the minimum amount of sugar and oil, it would be better than the current method of lining up to buy half a pound of sugar. Over the past two weeks, Chinese newspapers have been reporting daily on the black market prices of food. For example, the price of rice along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway is 250 yuan, while the price of rice in Shanghai has tripled (rice rationed per capita is not included in this example). According to well-informed sources, the daily distribution of 1,000 dan of vegetable oil is not only sufficient to meet the needs of the residents of the two concessions, but also to meet the legitimate needs of residents in the western district and Pudong. Of the approximately 2,000 oil shops in Shanghai, 400 are suspected of engaging in speculation, which has led to higher oil prices. Some of these black market speculators are currently not being allocated vegetable oil.</p>
<p>Thorough Control; Per Capita Rationing</p>
<p>As for sugar, although the Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative has repeatedly announced that stocks are sufficient, hoarders and speculators continue to be active, and the public has not been able to obtain the sugar they need daily. With regard to meat, the authorities issued a price limit on October 11, but very few food shops and vendors complied with the price limit when selling meat. The pork market situation was quite bad about six weeks ago, but it has improved slightly since then, but not completely. And the market price of beef and mutton is also openly higher than the price limit. Since unscrupulous merchants disregard official regulations, the public is even more urgently demanding a thorough control and per capita rationing system for all foods.</p>

<p>The "Public" monthly magazine, founded by the contemporary erudite scholar Qian Xumi, sold out within three days of its premiere on the 1st of this month. Distribution points in Shanghai and other places have requested additional copies, so an additional edition was immediately printed and released yesterday. The content is wonderful, and it has a good reputation. The whole book is 250 pages and sells for 5 yuan. The office is located at No. 48, Lane 228, Baker Road, phone number 91131. The distributors are Wuzhou Pictorial Society, and the distributors are Huxi, Bai Peng Chunming, Zhongxi, and Qiuyi.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Record of an Interview with Mr. Xia Jingguan <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The old seniors in the literary and academic circles, in the present day, are as sparse as the morning stars. The countable ones are the five old gentlemen Jin (Songcen), Li (Bake), and Qian (Mingshan), and Chen (Hecai). Some are known for their classical Chinese, others for their poetry. But besides poetry and prose, the one who can write and paint is Mr. Xia Jingguan.</p>
<p>At the extreme west of Avenue Joffre, a place called "Jingcun," I met two old men with flowing white beards. When I arrived, they had probably been quietly wielding their brushes and ink, busy with their art. After readjusting their clothes, they slowly came out to meet me. At that time, Mr. Xia put down his pen and chatted with me. He had unique insights on politics, society, science, and all kinds of knowledge, and was by no means as stubborn as ordinary people. He pointed me to a completed painting under a corner of the bright window. It had faint peaks and sparse forests, and was inscribed with twenty-four characters: "In a world of great peace, people do not travel to and fro, new houses are built, leaning against the mountains, dogs bark sparsely, and roosters crow harmoniously." A kind of unattainable ancient style seemed to awaken my tired soul, which had just swallowed a full "world of dust." He told me that he always leaned over this corner of the bright window to wield his brush for an entire morning. As soon as one piece was finished, another would come next, it was a bit overwhelming. He is not an ordinary artist, he is a famous veteran in the literary world, a craftsman in the art world. From November 6th, at the urging of his friends, he held a painting exhibition at the Ningbo Fellow Countrymen Association for three days, and today is the last day.</p>
<p>Jingcun, how fortunate to have this noble and old gentleman residing there. "Only through purity and quiet can one travel freely in the spirit," this is the meaning of Yang Ziyun's "Mystery," perhaps he loves Jingcun for this reason! I thought. (Huazi)</p>

<p>The Middle School Cup Round Gate Ball League, sponsored by Shiye Middle School, was originally scheduled to kick off today.

At that time, a mixed team of men and women from the West Union will be invited to participate in the performance.

<p>Yesterday, the woolen fabric market saw significant progress, mainly due to the Zhuma Company's high-priced purchases of grass-green broadcloth and serge. Merchants from Nanjing, Xuzhou, and Bengbu showed slight interest. Simultaneously, favorable buying news spread frequently. With the first ten days of the month passed, buyers began to take action, leading to a surge in both retail and wholesale transactions. Consumer confidence rebounded, and prices began to rise. Flannel, palis, white drills, white serge, "Guang Huo" (plain weave) spring light tweed, summer gauze and rubberized fabrics, and similar items from various brands were successively acquired by major wholesalers in the industry. As a result, market sentiment improved significantly, with prices rising and shortages appearing. Yesterday, "Guang Huo" spring light tweed from foreign sources sold for around 400 yuan for ordinary quality, while goods from eastern factories sold for around 300 yuan, and local factory goods for 200 yuan.

<p>Although the price of dried mussels has recently stabilized, it remains high compared to previous levels, with no signs of easing. Yesterday, market prices were as follows: large Dongdan (Eastern dried mussels) sold for 3,800 yuan, small Dongdan for 3,300 yuan, domestic Ningbo dried mussels for 4,000 yuan to 3,950 yuan, San Zi Gong (three-seed offering) for 3,600 yuan, and Yuan Dan (original dried mussels) for 3,000 yuan to 2,950 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Beans Remain in Demand <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>The arrival of beans has been delayed for a long time, and the allocation of goods is also scarce, resulting in high demand and prices. About ten bags of Pudong Du beans were traded at a price of 280 yuan.</p>
<p>The supply and demand of bean cakes are relatively balanced, and there are no significant price changes. 500 pieces of Changji bean cake were traded at 72 yuan and 7.5 jiao. One cart of Yuanlong bean cake was 76 yuan, and two carts for delivery in two weeks were 74 yuan and 7.5 jiao to 74 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>

<p>The jewelry gold price quoted by large silver firms such as Daxin Tonghang at the storefront was initially 2,650 yuan per tael. At 9:30 AM, it dropped by 50 yuan to 2,600 yuan (buy-back price reduced by approximately 300 yuan). The inter-dealer price remained weak, opening 30 yuan lower at 2,340 yuan. It then slightly recovered to 2,360 yuan. After 10:00 AM, the market stabilized at around 2,350 yuan, which was slightly lower (20 yuan) than the previous day, with a difference of 20 yuan. Transaction volume was low. The price of standard silver jewelry remained at 14 yuan per tael, with an inter-dealer price of 12 yuan and 57.5 jiao.</p>

<h3 id="e35">"Shuang Ma" Factory Receipts – Trading Vanishes <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market has recently experienced rapid and unpredictable fluctuations, causing anxiety and fear. Previously, due to the higher price of current yarn in the Beijing-Shanghai Railway area, speculators became very active, and buyers were even more crowded. Under these circumstances, the market price soared, breaking through the 7,000 yuan mark. At this time, short sellers, unable to cover their margin calls, began to falter. In particular, one company, with a large number of short positions, was unable to cover and was forced to close down, causing significant market turmoil. Simultaneously, news of stricter government control further unsettled those with long positions. The market price suddenly reversed, plummeting from over 7,000 yuan to 6,500 yuan, with a low of 6,430 yuan. Today, the Shanghai Municipal Council issued a notice strictly prohibiting trading in "Shuang Ma" factory receipts, with penalties for violations. As a result, trading in "Shuang Ma" factory receipts ceased immediately. The previously transacted amounts were generally settled at a price of 6,600 yuan to finalize the transactions, although most have not yet been accepted.</p>

<p>According to a quick letter from Nanjing yesterday, prices for black melon seeds showed a slight easing, but the amount was very small and still difficult to transfer to Shanghai. Xu Da Pian Zi (Xu large slice seeds) were priced at 840 yuan, Tongcheng Zi (Tongcheng seeds) at 720-730 yuan, Wuhe Zi (Wuhe seeds) at 580 yuan, and Linhuai Zi (Linhuai seeds) at 560 yuan.</p>

<p>The previous arrival of guest goods (fleeceflower root) has been held up until now due to unmet offers. Yesterday, the market offered slightly increased bids, only about 20 yuan higher than before, still under negotiation and potentially leading to a transaction.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Cigarettes, Soap, and Candles: Prices Fall <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The market prices of cigarettes, matches, soap, and candles are all trending downwards. This is largely due to the tight credit conditions affecting all goods, causing them to decline successively. The cigarette market price has been difficult to stabilize, following the downward trend. British brands fell to 9,000 yuan, Old Knife brand to 8,000 yuan, Pin Hai to 7,900 yuan, Fairy brand to 7,150 yuan, and Wuhua brand to 7,000 yuan, a decrease of 100-200 yuan compared to the previous day. Japanese cigarettes: Golden Gun brand at 3,150 yuan, Golden Building at 3,500 yuan, Quanlu brand at 3,250 yuan, Compass brand at 2,700 yuan, Beauty brand at 5,400 yuan, and Golden Mouse brand at 3,900 yuan, Pyramid at 6,250 yuan all showing weakness. Phoenix brand matches at 2,500 yuan, Gubensao soap at 395 yuan, Huangxiangmao soap at 290 yuan, and Arrow Knife soap at 260 yuan, also down slightly less than ten yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Rayon Also Trending Down <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the rayon market has also been trending downward due to the decline in yarn and cloth prices. No. 120 Tianqiao (Sky Bridge) bright silk opened at 7,380 yuan yesterday morning, closing at 7,400 yuan, down 85 yuan from the previous day. Xuhui was at 7,400 yuan, Jin San Ma (Golden Three Horses) at 7,465 yuan, Toyo at 7,200 yuan, Silver Bird at 7,340 yuan, Fuji at 7,150 yuan, and No. 150 Golden Ring Star at 7,200 yuan, No. 75 Golden Chicken semi-gloss at 5,800 yuan.</p>

<p>Recently, there has been no improvement in sales of new foreign silver dollars and square ingots. Guest merchants have lost interest, and local manufacturers and users are also showing little interest, so the market price has not fluctuated much. New foreign silver dollars and square ingots are selling for 12,000 yuan per ton, with a slight premium for different patterns.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Tinplate Continues to Increase <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local yarn factory used rolling machines to search for more than ten sheets of No. 24 and No. 26 tinplate, and the market atmosphere inevitably revived. Standard asking prices continued to increase. Currently, No. 24 pattern is offered at 160 yuan per sheet, and No. 26 goods at 140 yuan.</p>

<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Cold weather is the most threatening season for impoverished compatriots. They are plagued by hunger and cold, and it is truly difficult for them to survive. This is proven by the annual statistics of people freezing to death on the streets.</p>
<p>We experienced a scorching summer this year, and we anticipate an exceptionally cold winter. Thinking of our impoverished compatriots, we cannot help but worry about them, because everyone has compassion.</p>
<p>However, unorganized relief efforts also have significant drawbacks. Now there is an opportunity for us to fulfill our responsibility of human mutual assistance, because the YWCA is launching a winter clothing drive, with five ways to participate. In addition to donating money or labor, we can also donate unused old clothes and socks to the YWCA.</p>
<p>While taking care of our own winter preparations, participating in the winter clothing drive is arguably the most meaningful work we can do right now.</p>

<p>— Mrs. Huang Zuoting, Huang Xuepa</p>
<p>The happiest person in the world is not the one with a house full of gold or lofty fame, but the one who can build their own happiness on the happiness of others, helping others everywhere and working diligently for the happiness of others.</p>
<p>The YWCA's annual winter clothing drive is about to begin again. Perhaps in these difficult times, you may feel "powerless" to contribute to these good deeds. However, I believe that you and I are still living a happy family life with plenty of food and clothing, which is much happier than the many people suffering from hunger and cold in the icy and snowy weather. As long as we slightly economize on our personal and family daily expenses, we can accumulate a small amount into a large sum, which is enough to sew thin cotton clothes for these many starving and freezing people.</p>
<p>"The greatest happiness is doing good." Please donate generously!</p>

<p>— Translated by Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>Mr. Ge Laiheng's son was once again promoted, from an accounting clerk to a traveling salesman, and set off to another city. Mr. Ge Laiheng did not have a good impression on the day of his departure, so he immediately wrote a letter to give him many pieces of advice. This kind of advice would not be given to ordinary people who know that Mr. Ge Laiheng's son is the company's young master. His father's ability to put aside the private feelings between father and son and frankly speak his mind from the company's perspective is very valuable to him.</p>
<p>Letter 10: The Way of Doing Business</p>
<p>Dear Son:</p>
<p>When I watched you depart yesterday to begin your travels, I felt somewhat uneasy because you seemed very proud, as if you were now the most important person in the entire company. But you need to know that what we need are orders, not the flamboyant demeanor of an external employee.</p>
<p>Sausage is one of the main products of our company, so everything should be planned very carefully. Last week, the director of the sausage department suggested adding a lead tag to the sausage. I immediately stopped him, because that would invisibly become a trademark, which would add a lot of trouble when selling in the future. This proves our prudence in handling affairs.</p>
<p>I hope you will firmly remember in your mind that this trip is somewhat of a test. Whether you can succeed completely depends on your own efforts. A true salesperson is one-tenth speaking and nine-tenths judgment. He should use nine-tenths of his judgment to determine when to use that one-tenth of speaking. Many salespeople think that purchasing agents are interested in baseball and funny stories, and that doing business is only secondary. However, people who can reach the position of purchasing agent cannot succeed by listening to jokes.</p>
<p>Of course, it is best if you can be amiable in dealing with people, but excessive amiability becomes useless. A truly shrewd purchasing agent is not interested in anything other than the quality and price of our goods. You don't have to give in to your competitors, but you don't have to talk about their shortcomings. You don't have to kneel down to beg for orders, but you can't hold your nose too high either. During your travels, you will inevitably meet many people you don't like, but those people are precisely the ones who can have a business relationship with the company.</p>
<p>If you want to be a top-notch salesman, you should aim for the following three points: (1) Send orders to the company, (2) Continue to send more orders, (3) Send orders of greater value. If you can do these three points, then you will definitely not have time to write long letters, and we will definitely not have time to read long letters, because we will be busy manufacturing and shipping goods. We are not interested in the orders that others have obtained, so if someone else steals your order, you don't have to report to the company, because the most appropriate way, of course, is not to have your business stolen by others. The best way is to send your address and orders to the company every day, so that we can know all your dynamics.</p>
<p>I once represented a company and went to Cairo, Egypt to sell clothing supplies. When I arrived there, I initially came into contact with the new environment and thought that there was a very good possibility of sales, and that business would definitely succeed in the future. However, the results of the sales were not as ideal as I had imagined, so I often wrote letters to the head office reporting the reasons for the failure and the details of how the competitors were stealing business. As a result, the head office sent a telegram with the text: "We know all the movements of the competitors, they have obtained all the business, but what are you doing?" At that time, I immediately understood that it was useless to explain any further, and the only thing to do was to resign, so I sent out the resignation letter. Now we have the same attitude towards you, waiting for your orders or your resignation letter.</p>
<p>Your loving father, Ge Laiheng.</p>
<h3 id="e45">A Letter to the Children <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Qi</p>
<p>Dear Children:</p>
<p>Time flies so fast, and the cold winter is coming again. Are the children also unhappy about the arrival of winter? Because it is too cold, your fingers will freeze and turn red, and your mother will not allow you to go out to play. But children, have you seen many poor children on the road? They are wearing thin clothes, walking and working on the road, hungry and cold. They are just as good children as you are, and their mothers love them too, but they are too poor. In order to live, they have to work in the wind and snow.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I walked past Yu Qiaqing Road and saw many people surrounding a bundle. There was a dead child lying there, his small face convulsed with terror. Alas, children, I was extremely sad. You see, this child died without doing anything wrong.</p>
<p>In this cold winter, children, I don't know how many poor children will freeze to death or starve to death. People should help each other. Now the YWCA has launched a winter clothing drive to help these many suffering children. Children, would you be willing to save a little bit of your candy money to help these many suffering children? We hope that you and your parents will save together to sew cotton clothes for these many suffering children.</p>
<p>Your friend, Lu Qi</p>
<p>November 6th</p>
<h3 id="e46">YWCA Launches Winter Clothing Drive <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The weather is getting colder and colder, and there seems to be a bleak atmosphere on the streets. Of course, on the roads in the cold winter, you can see fur coats, woolen coats, and velvet coats! Warmly dressed pedestrians, but have you ever seen those hardworking and impoverished people, who for their own lives, wear only their thin winter clothes, braving the fierce wind, stepping on the ice and snow, and working? Do their teeth chatter, and their bodies and legs tremble? When you walk past them, have you ever had the compassionate thought of reaching out a hand to save them? Seeing the need for this relief work, the Shanghai YWCA has distributed winter clothing in previous years. This year, everyone knows that life is more difficult, so the need for this relief work has also increased accordingly. Although this work is quite complicated and difficult, the YWCA, based on its consistent spirit of service in the past, will continue to promote this work this year. Naturally, the completion of this work still depends on the sponsorship and promotion of enthusiastic people in society.</p>
<p>"Relief Targets" The relief targets this year are still the general elderly, weak, and women and children.</p>
<p>"Purpose of Donations" The purpose of the donation is "30,000 yuan." It is estimated that new clothes can be sewn at 60 yuan per set, which can make 500 sets, that is, 1,000 pieces. It is hoped that 5,000 sets of old clothes can be collected (that is, 10,000 pieces). If the donation exceeds that, then of course there will be more clothes.</p>
<p>"Methods of Donation" The YWCA is just a social service organization. The donation of funds depends entirely on enthusiastic people in society, who cooperate and pledge donations. The methods of donation can be divided into the following aspects: (1) Donating cash—pledging set donations (60 yuan per set) or donating arbitrarily (amount not fixed). (2) Donating winter clothes and asking our association to distribute them on your behalf. (3) Donating new and old fabrics, cotton, thread, foreign currency, etc. (4) Donating labor—volunteering to sew clothes. (5) Donating old clothes, old shoes, old pants, old socks, etc. All the above items are very welcome if donated.</p>
<p>"Sewing and Distribution of Clothes" is in line with the nature of relief. We will use generally unemployed women to sew clothes. Under the principle of paying by the piece, their lives can be slightly subsidized. In addition, we will invite our members and enthusiastic people in society to jointly undertake this sewing work. As for the distribution of winter clothing, it is also very strict. Receiving winter clothing must be introduced by a reliable organization or individual and approved by our association after investigation to confirm that it is needed.</p>
<p>"Winter Clothing Committee Implements Work" All the above-mentioned work related to winter clothing donations, sewing, and distribution will be implemented and promoted by the Winter Clothing Committee of our association. Donation accounts and the number of people who received relief will be publicly published in the newspapers in the future.</p>
<p>"Donation Date and Collection Points" The donation date is from now until the end of this month. The collection points are the following four places: (1) Our association's office at 638 Weihaiwei Road, (2) Our association's Shanghai nursery at 66 Daxilu Road, (3) Our association's dormitory at 8, Lane 1086, Yuyuan Road, and (4) Our association's dormitory at 206 Yuanmingyuan Road.</p>

<h3 id="e47">Talking about Making Steamed Buns (Mantou) from Experience <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— Xingye</p>
<p>Every time we receive flour, we always make pancakes and noodles to eat. It is inevitable to get tired of it. I wanted to make steamed buns, but I didn't know how to ferment them. Once, I received flour at the rice store and bought a piece of Xinya yeast. I took a sheet of instructions and went back to try it, and it turned out very well. Now I will write down my experience below for reference.</p>
<p>First, dissolve a piece of yeast in lukewarm water and mix well, add a little sugar. Then weigh two catties of flour, put it in a ceramic basin, slowly pour in the dissolved water, kneading as you pour, and knead it into a soft dough. Cover it with a damp towel and place it in a warm place (such as near the stove), and then wait for it to ferment.</p>
<p>After three hours, go and take a look. The dough has swelled to more than twice its original size. I was very surprised and thought that this yeast was indeed good. Immediately, I made individual steamed buns and arranged them on the table (sprinkle some dry flour on the table first). Because if it is not covered well, the steamed buns will be blown by the wind and form a hard skin, so they will not be soft.</p>
<p>At this time, prepare the pot, steamer (or steaming rack). Put a damp cloth in the steamer, first use a strong fire to boil the water. Then put the prepared steamed buns into the steamer, steam for about ten minutes, the hot steam rises straight up, and the steamed buns are ready. I ate the soft steamed buns that I made myself, and my heart was happy, which is truly indescribable in words.</p>
<p>If the reader is interested, you may as well make them to change the taste, since Xinya yeast is sold in rice stores and food stores. (Advertisement)</p>
