<h3>阿拉伯的古與今（二）</h3>
<p>中經五代，以迄於宋，一直沒有間斷。宋代的市舶管理，多少與阿刺伯人的交易有關係。元人代趙宋而有中原，對於阿刺伯人的貿易，更加鼓勵。而海舶出入最繁之港口，則為泉州而非廣州。這也許由於蒲壽庚的經營所致，也許由於泉州的地理位置關係。</p>
<p>輩阿刺伯人之來中國，多與華人雜居，或竟採用華人姓氏，生活方式也多受華人習俗。惟宗敎則仍篤守伊斯蘭敎，間或也有集聚的定處，則稱為蕃坊，頗似近來之租界。宋代待遇蕃客（即阿刺伯人），頗為優渥。有私法者，多使其用阿刺伯法律處置，叉似近來之領事栽制權了。</p>
<p>宋元時各港口之阿刺伯人，大抵非常富有，服用非常奢侈。沒出息的地方官，往往求阿刺伯人資助，阿刺伯人也以此勾結官家，施其豪媚技倆。上邊所述的蒲壽庚，就是此中代表。阿刺伯人多有娶漢女為妻，修習漢學的。甚至有應中國的科舉，博取功名，做中國的官吏的，凡此種種，都有史籍可為佐證。</p>
<p>宋元時南方海洋上的交通，都用帆船。這些帆船有的是阿刺伯人的，有的是中國人的。自阿刺伯以至中國，往返約須二年。大約自阿刺伯海來華，多在陰曆四月末至五六月，即印度洋上季候風（monson）的當兒。而由中國以返阿刺伯，則為十月末至十二月，即北半球東北貿易風（tradewind）當令的時候。而阿刺伯人在中國沿海各港口做生意，最繁盛的時期，就在六月以至十月　幾個門中。</p>
<p>阿刺伯人之來華營商，有按年返國者，有在華久住者，交易之時，通常有舌人，稱曰唐帕。但久住華土的阿刺伯人，就都能說華語寫華文了。</p>
<p>阿刺伯人對於西方文化的關係更是密切。中國的蠶絲火藥羅盤針製紙各種器物，都由阿刺伯人傳遞過去，這是史家共認的定說。共實阿刺伯人之加惠於歐洲人，並不以這種形下的器物為限。最要緊的，還是阿刺伯人對於學說的態度和方法。他們並不如中世紀歐洲人那麼受獨斷神學的影響，故能注意到古希臘人的理知成就。他們保存並傳譯希臘人的著作，這使得歐洲文藝復興時的幾個大師，對於搜集和閱，　希臘古籍的工作，减經了不少困難。我們很可以說，待歐洲文藝復興打前鋒的，乃是阿刺伯人。就是後來歐洲的大學制度和圖書館制度，也都是由阿刺伯人首先示範。—今日埃及開羅的大學，以及亞力由大城的圖書館，還是阿刺伯人所開的規模。—更有一點與歐洲文藝復興有密切關係的，是印刷術的引入。這是一柄開啟學術竇庫的鑰匙，歐洲人不能不感激阿剌伯人的。</p>
<p>阿刺伯人不僅僅以知慧的成就來影響歐洲人，他們而且具體地在歐洲大陸上建立過一番進步的文化。他們走在歐洲人之前。他們的續業，即今日的西班牙人，也不能企及。　就是他們在伊比里半島上，建立了以故爾陀伐為中心的回教國家。這個回教國家的民族　成，大多數是北非的摩爾人，可是其中也有不少阿刺伯人。他們在八九世紀時，着實使西班牙開出了燦爛的文明之花。農業的方法，農產品的種子，都大大有所改良。工業上則製造五金刀劍，紡績布匹，製造玻璃，製造皮革，製造紙張，推行郵政，批廣商業，即藝術敎育等也着實發達。凡近代文明國家所有東西，它都有了。然而歐洲人至今都抹殺了這位文明先進的老大哥，而看不起阿刺伯人。</p>

<h3>蘇嘉路上一小鎮　盛紡的產區　夏布拷綢缺貨唯我獨尊以全廠絲電力紡為最優</h3>
<p>夏季衣衫料子，每取輕薄爽利為第一，因之江西夏布，廣東拷綢，以及盛紡，便成為夏季衣料之寵兒。但自戰事以後，江西夏布來源早斷，廣東拷綢因在統制之下，亦幾絕跡。滬市夏布與拷綢，據經營該貨之商賈稱，幾乎可說都屬存貨矣。僅有盛紡，仍從產地源源運滬。今即就盛紡談談，以供消費者參考。</p>
<p>盛澤特產</p>
<p>盛紡乃盛澤紡綢之簡稱，盛澤為一小市鎮，係屬於江蘇吳江縣，在蘇嘉鐵路中，為比較重要之一站。全鎭人口約三四萬，鎮市面積不大、惟以其為絲綢工業地域，故繁華熱鬧異常，素有小上海之稱，為全吳江縣市鎮中之領袖。戰爭火　所到之處，淒慘情景是難倖免的，盛澤難遭受砲火之處不多，但也儘够使人目覩戰火之遺痕。幸而該鎭為絲綢工業區，故慘澹情景還較他鎭為輕微。</p>
<p>手工藝品盛紡本為手工出品，凡屬盛澤土著幾人人無不知紡機者，而所用之織機為舊式之木機，但近來亦已有利用雷力者，所謂曾力紡者，即指用電力織成之紡綢也。紡綢所用之絲，有屬廠絲，有用土絲。廠絲自較土絲光潔，故盛紡中以全廠絲電力紡為最優，土絲電力紡為其次，此外有光口紡。光口紡中有純白者，有條子者，有格子者，更有洋紡，則為盛紡中最次之貨，近來因廠土絲電力紡價貴，甚至有人以洋紡加練之後冒充發售者，然此種行經，盛澤本幫均不惜為，因要樹坍牌子之故，大都是外行客幫之把戲。</p>
<p>眞絲原料</p>
<p>盛紡本僅有純白一種，提花及格條紋均係後起曾有一時，蠶絲中夾以人造絲，或緯中夾以洋綫者，近來洋綫價貴而人造絲亦缺貨，於是盛紡一如昔日絲絲是真絲矣。盛紡好處，全在質料輕薄，價格較其他各地產品為廉，每至夏季，盛紡即活躍滬市。男子用以製為內衣或西裝襯衫，女子用以製旗袍或內衣，至如洋紡，用以為夾袍及絲棉衣服之裹最為得宜。盛紡因屬手工品，所以出品未能達到標準化，雖長短闊狹之間，出入甚少，然即因此而授人以口實，於運輸上常常遭受留難，綢商不免無形中增加不少消耗。大抵盛紡每疋闊約二足尺，長約十八碼，即四丈五尺足。每疋盛紡可以裁製男子西裝襯衫約六七件，男子短衫褲三套有餘，餘綢或尙可做女子旗袍一襲，今年流行之襯衫，為小方格及條子，大都即用盛紡裁製者也。</p>
<p>現在市價</p>
<p>盛紡中最佳之純廠絲電力紡，在戰前不過數十元一疋，戰後價格日增，迨至今日，其價自屬更貴。在本年五月初，全廠絲電力紡每疋不過法幣三百元，土絲者僅二百七八十元，格子光口紡每疋二百六七十元，條子二百四十元左右。至五月底，價目一跳，便增加原價二分之一，至改用中儲券後，其價格且比舊數為增加，即此時之價較五月初已一倍有餘矣。盛紡之所以日貴，原因全在絲價之狂漲，例如無錫廠絲，素為盛紡原料，而今廠絲飛騰，盛綢成本日重，其價格自亦不得不直綫上升。加以內地生活日高，工資日貴，織綢工人及綢商均不肯廉價脫手也。盛紡雖日貴，但比較他處綢貨沿屬低廉，至與布價洋府綢之價目飛躍，情形比較盛綢尚未過分也。</p>
<p>同樣盛紡各一疋，但貨色高低，頗有分別，有細潔光緻，有毛暗不勻，在價格上不免跟着有高低，大抵盛澤本　所做之貨，均經別選，即有毛暗之貨，亦先言明，決不自願做壞牌子耳。（甘）</p>

<h3>切實執行二對一　糧商慄慄自危　於大衆則為有益</h3>

<p>徐州金針菜產區已零星見新、申市因存底尙有、而客幫不吃高價、故多數無意急進、聞南京幫以手貨已罄、曾在該處採辦、致產價不鬆反緊、前後盤巳升聯鈔十元、有復緊之象、</p>
<h3>香烟一蹶不振</h3>
<p>香烟賣價續趨疲勢、因天時關係、致本街進胃微些、一般浮散戶出籠頗多、乃呈供多求少之象、昨日做開計大英牌八千八百元、老刀牌五千七百五十元、品海牌四千八百元、五華牌三千八百五十元、仙女牌三千七百元、五十枝大前門每箱二千三百元、十枝大前門二千三百五十元、廿枝大前鬥二千四百元、日烟金槍牌一千三百五十元、金大樓牌二千○廿元、紅玫瑰牌一千一百五十元、全祿牌一千七百五十元、指南牌一千二百七十元、國烟金鼠牌一千穴百元、美麗牌三千○五十元、金字塔二千九百元、均比上日降小、昨市金槍牌交易尙盛、餘者鮮少做開、氣勢頗為一蹶不振、</p>

<h3>推行崑曲　必先栽養笛師</h3>
<p>— 思莘閣主</p>
<p>度曲所以調和身心，南曲弛緩，句律和馴，北曲雄豪，激昂奮發，蓋盛世元音，弦歌雅頌之聲也。故由亂而治則興，由治而亂則衰。三五年來，海上歌聲，錯綜雜沓，正氣消沉，欲一聆演暢之音，其唯求之於崑。而仙霓分裂，已成殘局，朱傳茗從俞振飛配，張傳芳多授女票，鄭傳鑑教練戲校生徒，王傳淞改入蘇劇一途，而笛師如曙後孤星，更無新出者。然滬票京劇，力求深造，精研身段，追溯崑腔豪步，若販馬記，林冲夜奔諸劇，苟無佳笛，便見遜色。醉妃有悠然之調，彈詞得蒼凉之音，半皆笛孔相襯。惟一師之吹，代價菲薄，每日所得不過二三元，其何能以維持生活？無怪其改習他業，而終見此道衰零矣。　　近來就余所知之笛師，惟李亞雄。沈三明。金壽生。朱水鏡。蔣耕生。數人而已。李有嗜好，精神欠佳；金。沈。笛風最，而能戲又多。沈須節勞息養，非五年以上老友，不肯輕吹。朱與蔣戲較少，而能自奮不倦，所以支持各社，僅僅存此。予友褚君言，某日京票彩排，一本販馬記，登台所費三百餘金。崑票崇儉蓄德，謙廉可敬，顧栽養笛師，尤爲急要。其積極辦法，敦勸各曲社，各票房，招雇幼童，每社四人至六人，排日學笛。某調某腔，務求準繩，月試二次，評成績，定賞罰。其次選女童吹習員，兼唱兼習台步，每周規定若干小時，其他職業，仍可兼作，庶與經濟時光，兩不濫費。逢星期日，選曲本故事之忠正可風者，延社友義務傳講，先灌輸其曲情，收循循演進之效。平聲，賡春，嘯社，各有文藝家，音律家，當可互相誼助。若能依此誘掖，不出一年，必有造就，其大略如此，希望愛好者，改善而倡行之。</p>
<h3>猴戲聖手　郝振基逝世</h3>
<p>— 梅花館主</p>
<p>郝振基，爲北崑班中演猴戲聖手，在平津一帶，歷享盛名。近年以來，因年事巳高，乃息影家居，不願再以絕技示人。最近崑曲名小生白雲生在津主辦崑曲大會，原擬約郝伶加入合演，且巳見諸海報，詎知崑曲大會開演之日，竟未見老郝出台，一般觀衆，猶疑爲係白伶所玩之把戲，無非空氣作用，藉此以資號召耳。孰知噩耗傳來，老郝果已於上月月秒溘然長逝。（卒於玉田縣鴉鴻橋本宅）一代宗匠，懷技仙去，老輩英雄，又弱一個，不特崑曲班之不幸，實梨園界之一大損失也。</p>
<h3>電影院停發說明書　讀者意見一束</h3>
<p>— 惠影</p>
<p>「自七月一日起，中國影片停發說明書之消息宜佈後，一般影迷不免大掃其興。筆者試提兩個折衷辦法如下：　　每逢新片放映時，院方或影片公司可發行一種新片特刊刊物。如觀衆欲閱看可出資購買。　　新片放映之前，於申新兩報登一本事廣告，亦不失爲沒有辦法中之一個辦法。（醒夢）</p>
<p>某新片將獻映時，預先將該片本事登載於報紙之副刊上。</p>
<p>用　筆繕寫該片之本事，分黏於各戲院貼照片之處。本事說明書，字數不在多，但求簡括，段落分明便爲上乘。（鄭鑲凌）</p>
<p>影院當局在開演之前，用幻燈片將極簡明的本事演給觀衆一看。</p>
<h3>彈詞瑣話</h3>
<p>— 風</p>
<p>昔日彈詞界有「四大金剛」，就是馬趙姚王；馬如飛以「珍珠塔」名，趙湘洲以「描金鳳」名，姚士章以「水滸」名，王石泉以「果報錄」名。叉有所謂大三牲，就是朱耀庭。耀笙。的「雙珠鳳」，楊月搓。星搓。的「珍珠塔」，吳陛泉。西庚。的「白蛇傳」。因爲這三檔書各有各的口味，各有各的傳神處，且「朱楊吳」和「豬羊魚」是諧音，所以名之曰「大三牲」。</p>
<p>二年之前，會有人在中華職補校，附設「新說醫專修班」，招收初中學生，施以兩學期的訓練，上課時閒在晚閒，教員爲范烟橋，陸澹　，徐卓呆等。在緣起中有言云：「得在說書傷中，別樹一幟，在文學上有適當的價值，在職業上有獨造的知能，不談政治，不涉荒僻，不及猥褻」諸語。但以後即一直床聽到關於這專修班的消息不知現在還存在否？也許是因爲種種困難而停辦了吧，說書一業，與社會教育有密切關係，目前的「彈詞」和「評話」，實均有加以改進之必要，故關終此類專修班，不知能否重振旗鼓？</p>
<h3>閑話泰隆鮑華</h3>
<p>— 陶順聖</p>
<p>少年英俊的泰隆鮑華，五月五日生於美國的哦亥哦，中學畢業的時候，他曾演過一齣戲叫做「第六六六號軍官」。在這齣戲裏，他的演技頗爲他的父親所贊許，就親自加以訓練。他的父親原是以演莎士比亞戲劇而著名的。不久，泰隆鮑華就在芝加哥表演「威呢斯商人」中的老人。後來經過兩年的奮鬥，才得到了好萊塢的注意，開始作一名電影演員。在「蕩寇志」中飾一個愍不畏法的强盜，一副「盜腔」，給予觀衆一個新的印象。他那副冷靜的，嚴肅的，令人佩服的神情，活像一個勇敢的，柔情的，梁山上的英雄好漢。　　在「寶劍留痕」中，我們第一次見識到他的劍術；在最近獻映的碧血黃沙」中，我們更領略了他的鬥牛術。他眞是一個多才多藝的大演員。從他的作品中，我們可以見到他對於「芝加哥大火記」開攝的前一年，還是那麼平常，但是在「芝加哥大火記」以後，他不僅躍登銀壇的王座，而且做了全世界婦女的崇拜者。後來接着和瑙瑪希拉主演「絕代艷后」，和愛麗絲費與唐阿曼契主演「樂府滄桑」，和安娜葩拉與洛麗泰揚合演「蘇彝士」，演來均非常出色，從此，享受着空前的盛譽。</p>
<p>溫文爾雅的泰降鮑華，在工作的態度，是怎樣的認眞，他的演技是日見增進。我相信努力前進的人，他的前途該是遠大的。泰隆鮑華是有希望的。</p>
<p>在上海似乎也有一個美的少年演員，大家譽之爲「東方泰陸鮑華」。可惜他不會把他的美點表達川來，不會把他的才能從工作中顯露出來，未免有點辜負了大衆的期望。</p>
<h3>著名電影明星泰隆鮑華</h3>
<h3>舊劇伶人的絕技</h3>
<p>— 伍音</p>
<p>國人有一種自私的心理，不肯把自己所最擅長的技術，傳授給他人。許多老伶工，都有這種習性：所以有許多的絕技，再也不能在舞毫上見到，這眞楚使人萬分扼腕的。</p>
<p>老譚唱烏龍院的宋江，在閻媳姣逼他寫休書的時候，頭上戴的方巾會筆直豎起來，眞所謂怒髮冲冠。王瑤卿的長板坡，在縻夫人脫衣投井的時候，迅速乾淨，不落痕跡。陳喜才演扈家莊中的王英，能矮步與扈三娘交戰。小翠花醉酒，蹺工之佳，無出其右。陳德霖御碑亭之遇雨滑步，出神入化。朱素雲岳家莊之哭，宛似兒童一片天眞。尚和玉四平山要鎚，能在手掌中飛轉自如。楊小樓鐵籠山，在姜維携弓敗退時，低頭一轉，水髮與長鬢，各分左右，美觀絕倫。余叔岩問樵鬧府，能將鞋子踢起，輕輕自落頭上。此外像黃潤甫，錢金福，的臉譜，朱挂芳，九陣風，的出手，都是登峯造極，在現在的伶工中，尋不出對兒了。</p>
<p>中國舊劇的不能進步，原因很多，但這種自私的心理，無疑也是很重要的原因。希望一般目光遠大的伶人，消去此類惡劣心理，儘量將自己的技藝，傳給後人。否則，舊劇的前途，一定會從漸漸退化踏進破滅的危境。</p>

<h3>亞虎村劇之由來</h3>
<p>— 中堂</p>
<p>考惡虎村一劇，乃晚淸道咸閒之故事也。全劇係採取施公案中黃天霸，濮天鵬，武天虬，之三義絕交事之精華也。此乃武生之正工戲，凡觀過是劇者，未有不識共劇中之情節者，惟對於該劇起始之編排，及成此劇之原因，係出於何人之手，則稔之者或尚寥寥。茲就不佞所知略述於后，以作參老。</p>
<p>晚淸道咸年間，有表唱武生名沈小慶者，搭京劇春豪班，頗負時譽，且富編劇天才，時與淸廷刑部衙員名金老叫者過從甚密。一日金沈二人漫步閑遊，忽於某弄口見竚立一美艷少婦，情態浪漫，於眼角傳神之間，迭送秋波，金頗爲所動　欲挑逗之，爲小慶所阻，責以非禮。迨金烏西墜，乃各返家，此後金雖屢覓芳踪，無如均成泡影，致遷怒於沈，每思設法報復以洩憤。會某日適小慶病，金以雅片勸進，其疾果廖，迨第二次病，金叉如法泡製勸進，一面暗舉於官，遂繁於獄，至時金之憤乃消。迨及沈在獄中得悉金之陰謀事，遂抑鬱難伸，思編一劇以責金。熟思施公案中之黃天霸，與濮武二人本亦異姓兄弟，後以志趣不同，致演成三義絕交情勢，濮武陷害天霸固屬不仁。而天霸殺濮武全家尤其慘毒，因是全劇遂以此爲題材，而編成惡虎村之一劇矣。</p>

<p>不一會吃飯，依陳老太太的意思，還要老媽子去街上打一斤上好的陳紹。維城道：「這可不敢，我本來不喝酒，居喪了更不喝酒」。陳老太太也就罷了。但是她叉想着，應該到鄰家去借一個陪客的人，因爲她自己是個女人，叉吃着到處流行的六月素，對於招待方面，家裹派不出人來，就該去借。維城忙阻止道：「太伯母要這樣，就是不肯把我當做孫子了」。陳老太太這個主張，又給維城阻擋，看老媽子端出菜來，滿滿的堆了一桌子。維城要表示不是外人，陳老太太要他吃，他就吃，本來祇吃兩碗飯，在陳家倒是添了半碗·陳老太太還說他：出來多少存着一些客氣。　　吃完飯，不見國器國芳回來。維城知道陳老太太還沒吃飯，笑道：「我看他們兄妹房裹有幾本書，我去翻着看，太伯母你用飯吧。最好不要招待我」。維城獨自走進國芳的房裹，見鐵牀上鋪着一條軟席，牀頭堆着一個枕頭和一條毛巾毯子，從這一點上，知道家裹已是的的確確在等她回來。又往國器房裹看一看，也是一樣的陳設。他隨意在籘製書架上抽了一本書，並不看書，踱到國芳的牀前，想坐而還沒坐時，老媽子擰了手巾來。他擦了臉，忙不迭翻書來看。老媽子走出去了，不知不覺的坐了下去。牀前有着一把舊式的靠背椅，又有一個圓凳子，他都不坐，等到坐下了看時，才知是坐在國芳牀上。既然坐了，也就算了，不一定要矯枉過正，說這是坐不得的。不想老媽子又捧了一杯凉茶來，這不得不使他直挺挺的一站，接了老媽子的茶，連忙坐下去，却坐在圓凳上。那圓凳比牀的高度低了一寸有奇，維城把坐牀的經騐來坐圓凳，兀自一驚，杯子裹的茶，也潑了些在手上。（一二三）</p>

<h3>German Air and Naval Forces Attack British and American Convoy in the Arctic Ocean; One Cruiser, One Merchant Ship, and Twenty-Eight Vessels Sunk</h3>

<h3>Swedish Escort Ship Attacked</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Havas News Agency dispatch dated the 6th: The General Staff announced tonight that a Swedish warship escorting merchant ships in Swedish territorial waters between Landsort Island and the Swedish coast this morning was suddenly attacked by a submarine. A merchant ship was immediately hit by a torpedo. The warship then dropped depth charges on the submarine. The Navy Department also announced that a Swedish warship escorting merchant ships near the west coast of Öland in Swedish territorial waters had opened fire on a submarine of unknown nationality that appeared in the nearby waters. The Navy Department did not say whether the submarine was the same one that attacked the Swedish convoy near Landsort Island.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Huitong News Agency dispatch dated the 7th: The news that a Soviet submarine attacked a Swedish merchant ship within Swedish territorial waters yesterday and was repelled by a Swedish warship is being prominently featured in the local newspapers this morning. Most newspapers are publishing photographs of the destroyed Soviet torpedo boat. Well-informed sources in Sweden reveal that Soviet torpedo boats have taken such actions as many as five times in recent days. The Swedish ship "Fortuna" was attacked by a torpedo last Saturday, and was only half a meter away, and survived the attack. Sweden has decided to continue taking measures to protect its neutrality. The Swedish people find it difficult to tolerate the aforementioned actions of Soviet submarines and torpedo boats.</p>
<h3>Ninth Column Active Within Syria</h3>

<h3>Volcano Erupts on Sicily</h3>

<h3>British and New Zealand Forces Launch Major Counteroffensive in the Alamein Area of Egypt; Massive Tanks Deployed to the Front Lines; Axis Blitz Halted</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Huitong News Agency dispatch dated the 7th: Military circles in London stated yesterday that the British counteroffensive in the Alamein area of Egypt is not a large-scale one. The Reuters military correspondent in North Africa said that the New Zealand army is the main force in the fighting in the Alamein area of Egypt.</p>
<p>From a location on the Egyptian border, Havas News Agency dispatch dated the 6th: There have been no major changes in the Egyptian war situation today. Fierce fighting continues southwest of the Alamein area. According to news from Cairo, General Auchinleck is taking the offensive at several points, attempting to drive Axis forces out of their positions southwest of Alamein. Over the past 24 hours, British forces have launched repeated major counterattacks under the cover of artillery and tanks. Allied air forces are also continuously bombing German and Italian transportation lines. However, General Auchinleck's strategy cannot be considered decisive, as it only aims to defeat the Axis forces' advancing power. Therefore, military observers in Cairo generally believe that the situation has improved, but should not be overly optimistic. The British defensive line remains unmoved. General Auchinleck's aim is not only to keep Axis forces in their original positions, but also to defeat the Axis forces before General Rommel organizes supply lines through Tobruk and Benghazi. Everything now depends on whether General Auchinleck can obtain reinforcements in the shortest possible time. Rumors that General Rommel intends to advance towards the Siwa Oasis (100 miles south of Bardia) and then attack the Nile River Valley are not credible, as this would encounter significant difficulties. Historically, only the army of Alexander the Great attempted to invade from east to west, but since then, no one has dared to enter the desert.</p>
<p>Bern, Havas News Agency dispatch dated the 6th: The Swiss newspaper "Neue Zürcher Zeitung" recently reported that all sectors in London have been extremely optimistic since receiving the latest news from North Africa. The general public believes that General Auchinleck has completed the task of reorganizing the remnants of the Eighth Army and assigning them to the Egyptian Army and Near East Forces, and has deployed new massive tanks to the front lines. These tanks are comparable to German Mark tanks. In addition, a large number of aircraft are active, attacking the enemy's supply lines, especially the port of Benghazi, which has suffered significant losses. However, General Rommel will soon be able to transfer reinforcements from Greece and Crete and obtain supplies from Italy and Tobruk. Therefore, London should not be overly optimistic. General Auchinleck's main problem is whether he can react swiftly and be more rapid than General Rommel. Opening a second front in Europe is becoming increasingly important, as it is necessary to restrain enemy forces and alleviate General Auchinleck's difficulties.</p>
<p>Bern, Havas News Agency dispatch dated the 7th: The "Neue Zürcher Zeitung's" correspondent in London recently cabled that London is expressing complete confidence in the battle in the Alamein area of Egypt. The extreme caution and silence that British war correspondents had previously shown has completely changed their tone. One of them asserted that the first German offensive towards the Nile Delta has been repelled. At the same time, British military observers do not underestimate the danger posed by the enemy's pressure on Alexandria. The strategy that General Auchinleck, the Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in the Middle East, should adopt after repelling the enemy's initial offensive is currently under discussion. There are now two possible trends in the future of the war situation: whether the British have sufficient mechanized reserves to launch a counteroffensive and whether British bombing is sufficient to prevent the enemy's supply train from supporting the advance of armored units. At present, both sides will take full advantage of their time to mobilize troops and prepare their generals.</p>
<p>US Troops Participate in North African Campaign; Washington Confirms</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Tongmeng News Agency dispatch dated the 7th: According to news from Washington, the US War Department yesterday publicly disclosed for the first time that US troops are already in the thick of fighting, confirming rumors that have been circulating in Washington and other capitals around the world in recent days. According to a US War Department communiqué, American-made tanks driven by American soldiers participated in a portion of the battle in Libya on June 11th and 12th. They were part of an American armored corps observer team that had arrived in North Africa several weeks prior.</p>
<p>Near East Forces Transferred to Egypt as Reinforcements; Trains and Cars Requisitioned</p>
<p>Lisbon, Huitong News Agency dispatch dated the 7th: The US War Department issued an official communiqué last night stating that US troops have not yet participated in the battle in Egypt. Only members of a US technical mission are currently working in Egypt, having arrived only a few weeks ago. They have been observing the war in American tanks.</p>
<p>Istanbul, Havas News Agency dispatch dated the 6th: All trains on the eastern branch of the railroad have been requisitioned to transport Allied troops and military supplies to Syria and Egypt. As a result, rail traffic in Iraq and Turkey is now completely cut off. In addition, all types of cars have been requisitioned by the authorities.</p>
<h3>Gailani Advocates for Egyptian Revolt Against Britain, Saying the Opportunity to Fight for Freedom Should Not Be Missed</h3>
<p>Berlin, Havas News Agency dispatch dated the 6th: Gailani, the pro-Axis leader and former Prime Minister of Iraq, gave a broadcast address to the Egyptian people today, calling for a revolt against Britain. He stated briefly that the Suez Canal must belong to Egypt. Egypt will be the first country among Islamic nations to fight for freedom and break away from British shackles. Any force that oppresses us is our mortal enemy, past, present, and future. Egypt is now at the forefront of this freedom war and will not be isolated. All Arab neighbors are inextricably linked to it, as Palestine, Syria, and Iraq are all under British oppression. Britain has broken its promises countless times, and they have always deceived the people with sweet words.</p>
<p>Egypt Improves Air Defense Measures</p>
<p>Ankara, Huitong News Agency dispatch dated the 7th: The Egyptian Minister of Health and the Minister of Defense have initiated the establishment of an Air Defense Committee, as Egypt's current air defense equipment is extremely incomplete. The committee held a meeting in Cairo yesterday and decided to immediately build public air raid shelters and improve the shortcomings of past air defense measures.</p>
<p>Egyptian Strike Wave Not to Be Taken Lightly</p>
<p>Tokyo, Tongmeng News Agency dispatch dated the 7th: According to a "Yomiuri Shimbun" special dispatch from Sweden, sources in neutral Cairo report that workers in all of Egypt's major industries suddenly began a general strike on the 6th, citing harsh working conditions. The Egyptian government is deeply concerned and has warned the unions, demanding that the workers return to work within two days, or the military will be immediately deployed to enforce compliance. At the same time, it has ordered the formation of a special committee composed of labor and management representatives to study compromise methods. It is believed that the workers will reject this proposal. British authorities believe that the strike has been instigated by nationalists and have adopted a tough stance. The development of the situation is worthy of serious attention.</p>
<h3>German Forces Launch All-Out Offensive; Fierce Battle Rages in the Don Region; Germans Announce Capture of Voronezh; Soviet Forces Launch Counter-Offensive in the Orel Region</h3>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Bear City, July 7th: According to today's news, a division of German forces under General Kleist has breached Soviet defenses at several points along the Kursk-Kharkov front and has occupied Voronezh. This city is a key point in the Soviet defenses on the eastern side of the Don River. It is reported that the Germans have deployed a large force of one million troops and are currently advancing through the gap created by the breakthrough on the Ukrainian front. London sources have not confirmed the capture of Voronezh, but they have stated that German forces have already advanced to the outer defenses of this important city on the Moscow-Rostov railway. Moscow sources acknowledge that German forces have continued to make significant progress at several points on the central Soviet front. The Germans are currently advancing towards the main Soviet transportation routes behind the Don River. The Soviets are resisting with the heaviest KV-type tanks, each weighing 50 tons. It is reported that the situation in the central Kursk area is particularly serious for the Soviets. German armored car and tank divisions are continuing their intensive attacks. The Germans appear to be using their successful tactics of breaking through defenses with tanks, followed by infantry. Under this intense attack, the Soviets have been forced to retreat repeatedly.</p>
<p>Havas dispatch from an undisclosed location on the Soviet border, July 6th: German forces under General Bock have launched a new offensive in the northeastern Orel region, advancing along a line parallel to the Tula-Orel railway. Their objective appears to be to reach the railway line connecting Moscow to Voronezh. It is reported that German forces in this area had established defensive positions along the Zhizdra River two months ago and are now launching their offensive from this position. According to the latest reports, German forces have reached the town of Maslovka, northeast of Orel, which not only threatens the Moscow-Rostov railway but also the Tula-Kuibyshev railway. It is estimated that the combined forces on both sides of the front number no less than 200 divisions, with a large number of reserves in the rear ready to reinforce at any time. It is reported that General Timoshenko has also launched a counter-offensive in the Orel region, with the aim of flanking the German forces attacking the upper reaches of the Zhizdra River from the rear, or at least forcing General Bock to move northeast.</p>
<p>Havas dispatch from the Swiss capital, July 7th: According to Berlin sources, German political figures are confident that the German spring offensive plan will achieve significant success before winter. Although the German offensive in the Don region has achieved initial success, the Red Army still has a large number of reserves and armaments. The Red Army Commander-in-Chief has not lost all initiative, as evidenced by the Red Army's counter-offensive in the Orel region.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from the German Führer Headquarters, July 7th: This afternoon, the German military communique stated that our forces have crossed the Don River and captured the important industrial city of Voronezh.</p>
<p>Reuters Urgent dispatch from Berlin, July 7th: Well-informed military sources in Berlin revealed that the strategically important city of Voronezh, located on the east bank of the Don River, has been captured by German forces. The railway connecting Rostov to Moscow passes through this city, and there is now a risk that oil transported from the Caucasus to Moscow will be cut off by the Germans. Voronezh is located 200 kilometers east of Kursk.</p>
<p>Havas dispatch from the Swedish capital, July 6th: Moscow Radio has just released a battle report stating that fierce fighting is taking place west of Voronezh and southwest of Stary Oskol. Our forces have abandoned several villages and towns. The fighting on the Kursk front is also extremely intense. Our tank forces annihilated a regiment of enemy infantry and a battery of artillery. Nothing else is worth mentioning on other fronts. Reuters correspondent in Moscow reports that Soviet forces, under intense German pressure, have made an orderly retreat from the Kursk, Belgorod, and Volchansk sectors. Soviet newspapers also acknowledge that German forces have broken through Soviet defenses at several points, and Soviet forces have been forced to retreat. The German forces used in the sector east of Kursk consisted of four armored divisions, five or six infantry divisions, and two mechanized divisions. The terrain in that area is a plain, with only a few rivers as obstacles for mechanized units, which are easily overcome. According to the latest news from Moscow, Soviet forces have recently launched a vigorous counter-offensive, halting the German advance. The Red Army's official newspaper, "Red Star," also confirms that German pressure north of Kursk is increasing, and the situation in Belgorod is particularly serious. The Germans are currently advancing northeast, apparently aiming to link up with the right flank of General Bock's army. The Soviets acknowledge that the Germans occupied an important position there yesterday, but tank and infantry units are still engaged in fierce fighting. According to Soviet sources, although the Germans have made progress, they have paid a heavy price. In one sector alone, the Germans have suffered 1,200 casualties and lost 50 tanks. It is reported that General Timoshenko's forces have launched several counter-offensives on the southern and central fronts. Despite heavy rain in the Rzhev and Gzhatsk regions, fierce fighting continues. In addition, the German offensive on the Kalinin-Moscow line, which began last Thursday, also appears to have achieved significant gains. The Soviets indicate that the German forces on that line outnumber the Soviet forces, and German tanks have broken through Soviet defenses. The Germans claim that due to recent weather conditions, the German command has not been able to fully exploit its advantages.</p>
<p>German Summer Offensive Aims to Reach Volga River</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from the Swedish capital, July 7th: Berlin dispatches to Swedish newspapers state that once Germany has achieved its objectives in the central Soviet offensive, its next move will almost certainly be a large-scale offensive in the southernmost sector of the Soviet front, with the Volga River region as its target. Berlin feels that General Bock will attempt to reach the Volga River in the next offensive. Hitler's operational plan is to capture the Caucasus, Leningrad, and Murmansk before the end of the summer campaign and to deploy German forces on the banks of the Volga River.</p>
<p>British and Americans Emphasize Eastern Front Situation; Public Opinion Calls for Opening of New Battlefield</p>
<p>Havas dispatch from London, July 6th: British observers generally believe that the situation on the Eastern Front appears to be becoming extremely serious and is likely to cause all sorts of major consequences.</p>
<p>Havas dispatch from Washington, July 6th: Since news of the German advance to the Don River arrived from the Soviet front, American circles have attached great importance to it. Public opinion is unanimously calling for the immediate opening of a second front in Europe to divert German forces and provide some assistance to the Soviet Union in this difficult and arduous environment. According to military experts here, the German aim is to capture the city of Voronezh in order to cut off the Moscow-Rostov railway. If the Germans are able to achieve this objective, the Southern Red Army will be isolated, and its supply of military supplies will become more difficult. At that time, the German offensive against the Caucasus region will be more convenient. The only solution now is for Britain to immediately invade the coasts of France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, regardless of the danger. However, according to Major Seversky, author of "Victory Through Air Power," a second front cannot be opened on the European continent until the Allied air forces have achieved absolute superiority, because landing on the European coast requires bombing of German transportation lines first. In addition, according to the well-known American political commentator Williams, the Allied number of pilots is not enough to protect the army landing, but should take action now. Even if it fails, it should be done by the army and navy first. In short, I can assert that invading the European continent is easier now than in the past.</p>
<h3>Argentina National Day Commemoration; President Castillo Reaffirms Determination to Maintain Peace; Resolves to Defend National Sovereignty With All His Might; Unwilling to Unreasonably Participate in Any War</h3>
<p>Reuters dispatch from the Argentine capital, July 7th: The Argentine army and navy held a banquet yesterday to celebrate National Day. The new Argentine President Castillo also attended and delivered a speech, reaffirming Argentina's determination to maintain peace. General Panding, the former Minister of National Defense, first delivered a speech on behalf of the army and navy, saying, "All of our officers and soldiers have great faith in the President's attitude of assistance at this difficult time and consider it a great honor. President Castillo handles state affairs based on the interests of the entire nation and is able to win the hearts of the people. The neutral policy pursued by the President does not neglect cooperation with other friendly nations in the Americas. This alone is enough to prove President Castillo's ardent patriotism and will never harm Argentina's sovereignty. President Castillo's position is supported by the entire people." President Castillo then delivered a reply, saying, "We respect others and therefore respect ourselves. We deeply hope that the policy based on reciprocity will not be undermined by one side. Some professional agitators are taking advantage of the situation and confusing the public under the name of democracy. They should go to the battlefield to work, not just cause trouble in the rear. There are also enemies of democracy within our own class, so I cannot allow them to interfere with the government's policies. The government will defend the sovereignty of the country with all its might and will not lose the dignity of the country. This can be reported to the entire people. At this difficult time, the joint responsibility of the officers and soldiers of the army and navy to defend the country is greater than before. We love peace and are unwilling to participate in any war unreasonably. Pan-Americanism is used to promote the close relationship between the nations of the Americas, not to launch a war."</p>
<p>Cargo Ship Bombing Incident; Ministry of Foreign Affairs Issues Statement</p>
<p>The Argentine Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued an important statement today. The full text is as follows: "On June 30, this Ministry received a note from the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs forwarded by the Argentine Embassy in Germany. The note acknowledged the protest filed by Argentina on June 26 regarding the sinking of the Argentine ship 'Tercero' by a torpedo fired by a German submarine and expressed its apologies. In order to maintain diplomatic relations between the two countries, Germany is willing to compensate for the losses. However, according to the report of the commander of the submarine, he and his crew were unable to identify the ship's national emblem, which is probably the truth. The note also stated that this Ministry has recently received reports from various locations stating that German submarines allowed ships to continue sailing after identifying that they belonged to Argentine nationality and did not cause any difficulties. This shows that German submarines have no intention of deliberately insulting the Argentine flag. As for the Argentine government's request for permission for Argentine ships to freely pass through, the German government believes that as long as Argentine merchant ships clearly display their national emblems, they will not be attacked by German submarines." The Ministry of Foreign Affairs statement also stated, "Today, this Ministry also sent a note to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs' reply has been reviewed in its entirety, but based on the results of the investigation by this country's government, it should be solemnly stated that the 'Tercero,' which was sunk by a German submarine, did indeed display its national emblem and had other markings indicating its nationality."</p>

<h3>Rebellion Occurs Within South Country; Italy Announces Account of Suppressing Rebellion</h3>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Rome, July 7th: The Italian semi-official news agency Stefani News Agency issued a special dispatch detailing the suppression of the Communist rebellion in Montenegro, stating that an Italian division had been ordered to engage in the work of clearing out the Communist crisis, and many Montenegrin nationalists participated in the Italian army. The Italian army advanced from the town of Nikšić towards the main Communist base of Mount Vojnik, the headquarters of which was located on the summit of Mount Utčam, 2,556 feet above sea level. After a fierce battle, the Italian mountain troops occupied the Communist position, and its leaders, Kovačević and the leader of the Montenegrin rebellion, Đjlete, were forced to flee. The Communists attempted to recover the mountain with young party members aged 18 to 20 but were repelled. The Italian army finally completely annihilated the Communists, and the situation in the area has returned to normal. The Italian army is assisting in repairing the roads destroyed by the Communists.</p>

<h3>Arabia: Past and Present (2)</h3>
<p>Through the Five Dynasties and up to the Song Dynasty, it never stopped. The Song Dynasty's management of maritime trade was somewhat related to trade with Arabs. The Yuan Dynasty replaced the Zhao Song Dynasty and had the Central Plains, and further encouraged trade with Arabs. The busiest port for ships entering and exiting was Quanzhou, not Guangzhou. This may have been due to Pu Shougeng's management, or it may have been due to Quanzhou's geographical location.</p>
<p>Many Arabs who came to China lived with Chinese people, or even adopted Chinese surnames. Their lifestyle was also greatly influenced by Chinese customs. However, they still strictly adhered to Islam. Sometimes they gathered in fixed places, which were called Fanfang, which were quite similar to the concessions in recent times. The Song Dynasty treated foreign guests (i.e., Arabs) very well. In cases involving private law, they were often allowed to be handled according to Arab law, which was similar to the consular jurisdiction of recent times.</p>
<p>During the Song and Yuan dynasties, the Arabs in various ports were generally very wealthy and lived a very luxurious lifestyle. Corrupt local officials often sought assistance from Arabs, and the Arabs used this to collude with government officials and show off their flattery skills. Pu Shougeng, mentioned above, is a representative of this. Many Arabs married Han women and studied Chinese. Some even took the Chinese imperial examinations, obtained fame, and became Chinese officials. All of this can be verified by historical records.</p>
<p>During the Song and Yuan dynasties, maritime transportation in the south used sailing ships. Some of these sailing ships belonged to Arabs, and some belonged to Chinese. It took about two years to travel back and forth from Arabia to China. Generally, ships came from the Arabian Sea to China in late April to May, during the Indian Ocean monsoon season. Ships returned from China to Arabia from late October to December, during the Northeast trade wind season in the Northern Hemisphere. The busiest time for Arabs doing business in various ports along the Chinese coast was from June to October.</p>
<p>Some Arabs who came to China to do business returned home every year, while others stayed in China for a long time. During transactions, there was usually a translator, called Tangpa. But Arabs who lived in China for a long time could speak and write Chinese.</p>
<p>The Arabs' relationship with Western culture was even closer. Chinese silk, gunpowder, compasses, papermaking, and various other items were all transmitted by the Arabs. This is a fixed saying recognized by historians. In fact, the Arabs' benefits to Europeans were not limited to these material things. The most important thing was the Arabs' attitude and method towards scholarship. They were not as influenced by dogmatic theology as Europeans in the Middle Ages, so they were able to pay attention to the intellectual achievements of the ancient Greeks. They preserved and translated the works of the Greeks, which made it much easier for the masters of the European Renaissance to collect and read Greek classics. We can say that the Arabs were the vanguard of the European Renaissance. Later, the European university system and library system were also first demonstrated by the Arabs. The University of Cairo in Egypt today, as well as the library of Alexandria, are still the scale opened by the Arabs. Another point closely related to the European Renaissance is the introduction of printing. This is a key to opening the treasury of knowledge, and Europeans cannot but be grateful to the Arabs.</p>
<p>The Arabs not only influenced Europeans with their intellectual achievements, but they also established a progressive culture on the European continent in a concrete way. They were ahead of the Europeans. Their successors, the Spaniards today, cannot even reach them. It was they who established the Islamic state centered on Cordoba on the Iberian Peninsula. The ethnic composition of this Islamic country was mostly Moors from North Africa, but there were also many Arabs. In the eighth and ninth centuries, they indeed made Spain blossom with a brilliant civilization. Agricultural methods and crop seeds were greatly improved. In industry, they manufactured metal hardware, swords, spun cloth, manufactured glass, manufactured leather, and manufactured paper. They promoted the postal service, expanded commerce, and also greatly developed art and education. Everything that modern civilized countries have, it had. However, Europeans still deny this civilized elder brother and look down on Arabs.</p>

<h3>Rationing of Grain Progressing Smoothly; Second Phase of Rice and Flour Allocation; Approximately 80,000 Bags of Flour; Price Not Yet Determined; Additional 19,000+ Bags of White Rice Released; Broken Rice Reduced by Half</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of the implementation of grain rationing. All 659 rice shops started selling household rice according to regulations from 8 a.m. The procedures were the same as the previous day. Each rice ticket was uniformly for 1.5 liters of white rice and 0.5 liters of broken rice, totaling 2 liters, sold for 5 yuan in rationing coupons. Therefore, the purchase of rice was very good. Residents were able to purchase the prescribed amount of rice from the registered rice shops written on their rice tickets. A Minghua News Agency reporter learned from various rice shops yesterday that the rice tickets received the day before had been pasted on the rice sales report form the previous night and sent to the Food Rice Management Committee offices of the two concessions yesterday for record. The number of rice sold yesterday was to be reported to the authorities by each rice shop today. In the future, the amount of rice sold by each rice shop on the first day must be reported on the next day and may not be neglected.</p>
<p>Second Phase of Rice Allocation Begins Payment</p>
<p>Currently, the Food Rice Management Committee of the two concessions has started the second phase of household rice allocation. For the International Settlement, there are 12,392 bags of white rice, 6,198 bags of broken rice, and 52,049 bags of flour. For the French Concession, there are 6,646 bags of white rice, 3,373 bags of broken rice, and 27,865 bags of flour. The price per bag is set at 309.30 yuan. The market price of flour has not yet been determined by the Price Stabilization Bureau. However, the full amount of the payment must be paid by 12 noon today, and the delivery order will be issued in the afternoon of the same day. At the same time, after the payment is made and the delivery order is obtained, the goods can be delivered from the designated warehouse starting on the 9th and must be delivered by the 11th in order to start the second phase of sales on the 13th.</p>
<p>Quantity and Price Determined Periodically</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Food Rice Management Committee yesterday, residents of this city will no longer have to worry about a shortage of daily rice in the future. Although each person can only temporarily purchase 2 liters of household rice per period, the two authorities are still actively trying to find a way to supply the household rice needed by each rice shop on a daily basis, so that they can sell rice for a long time. If it is factually possible, the amount of household rice purchased by citizens may be increased appropriately. On the one hand, the sales price will be determined periodically based on the actual situation.</p>
<h3>French Nationals Registration</h3>
<p>Can Be Handled Directly at the French Police Station; French Municipal Council Issues Notice: French nationals in this city, with the special permission of the Japanese authorities, may register directly with the French Concession Police Station, regardless of whether they reside within the French Concession. The notice also states that French nationals can obtain a registration certificate from any French police station. The completed form must be submitted to the Central Police Station.</p>
<h3>Embezzled Over 300,000 Yuan; Private Hoarding; Qiu Yutian Reported; Police Station Strictly Investigating</h3>
<p>Qiu Yutian, a 26-year-old man from Anhui, falsely claimed to his friends in April of this year that he had a large amount of white rice in a certain location outside the city. He could find a way to transport it to Shanghai for sale, which would be very profitable. At that time, the plaintiffs, Li Shuangyu and others, believed him and raised over 300,000 yuan, which they gave to him to operate outside the city. However, after Qiu obtained the money, he hoarded other goods and avoided meeting people. After several months, Li and others learned that he was hiding at No. 2, Liang'an Lane, Grolleau Road, in the French Concession and reported it to the police station. The police were instructed to go and arrest him and bring him to the police station for strict investigation.</p>
<h3>Fire on Pinlang Road; Two People Injured; Shanghai Printing Company Careless; Workers Fled the Factory</h3>
<p>At 1:45 p.m. yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out at No. 34, Lane 347, No. 347 Pinlang Road, Shanghai Printing Company. In an instant, the flames spread in all directions and were uncontrollable. After the Fire Brigade received the news, it rushed to the rescue and extinguished the fire after a long time. The damage was quite significant. When the fire spread, the workers inside were all working and fled for their lives. As a result, worker Lin Kunshi (24 years old) was burned on his back and left hand, etc., and Sun Xiaohai (25 years old) was burned on his body. They were sent to Tongren Hospital and Red Cross Hospital respectively for emergency treatment.</p>
<h3>British and American Bank Deposits to Be Fully Withdrawn; Withdrawal Limit Doubled</h3>
<p>It is hereby announced that the Chartered Bank has started four withdrawals from yesterday morning, the amount of which is 12% of the deposit balance on December 6 of last year. The total amount before and after these withdrawals will reach the total deposit balance. The withdrawal limit has now been increased to 1,000 yuan per month or 500 yuan per week, which is double the previous amount. It was previously only allowed to withdraw 1,000 yuan per month. At the same time, Citibank is now continuing to pay depositors with four withdrawals. Citibank's four withdrawals began last week and will continue until all depositors have withdrawn. As for the date of the next withdrawal from HSBC, it has not yet been decided, but it will not be far off, as HSBC has sufficient cash to meet all needs. The Agricultural &amp; Commercial Bank is now also paying depositors 500 yuan per week or 2,000 yuan per month. Mr. Hanschmann, the manager of the bank, said that most banks are now doing the same.</p>
<h3>Speculative Businesses Closed: Over a Hundred Companies Shut Down, Commodity Market Prices Calm and Stable, Vegetable Market Price Hikes Under Secret Investigation</h3>
<p>Shanghai Times reports: As a result of the authorities' strict measures to crack down on speculation, over a hundred small financial firms engaged in speculative transactions have been forced to close. Currently, there are 183 exchange shops in the concession area and 56 in the Hongkou area permitted to engage in military note trading. Additionally, several dozen more are currently applying to the authorities for permission to operate this business.</p>
<p>Speculation Ceases, Market Calms</p>
<p>It is reported that after the authorities adopted control measures, speculative trading on the local black market has virtually ceased. Activities in markets such as gold and foreign currencies have completely stopped. Only government bonds and Chinese merchant stocks still have some minor trading. Due to banks refusing to provide loans, speculators can no longer continue their activities. As a result, the commodity market has become calm and stable.</p>
<p>Vegetable Price Increases to be Severely Punished</p>
<p>While the authorities are actively stabilizing various commodity prices, some vegetable vendors have dared to raise prices arbitrarily, causing the prices of vegetables, fish, and shrimp to exceed the set limits. Ordinary people are finding this unbearable. The concession authorities, recognizing this, have already dispatched personnel to conduct a secret investigation and have decided to impose severe punishments to alleviate the people's suffering. It is reported that the local South Goods Merchants Association, in order to comply with the authorities' intention to suppress commodity prices, yesterday specifically notified all members through the trade association that they must sell goods at half the original price in new currency as stipulated from May 26th to 28th, so as to avoid arbitrarily raising prices.</p>
<h3>The Chen Huang Family Suicide Case: Police Suggest Joint Suicide Should Avoid Punishment</h3>
<p>Chen Huang, a Guangdong woman residing at No. 225 Gan Village, Gan Si Dong Road, French Concession, was accused of theft and reprimanded by her employer last month on the 26th. Due to environmental pressures, she had a desire to end her life. Her eldest son, Guo Zhu, 18 years old, her second daughter, Cui Xia, 15 years old, and her youngest son, Guo Jun, 9 years old, along with herself, burned a coal briquette stove in the attic at night, hoping to suffocate themselves. At 9 a.m. the next morning, when Guo Jun did not arrive at Longmen Elementary School for the exams, a classmate was sent to his home to investigate, and the tragic family scene was discovered. The police were notified and an ambulance was dispatched to the hospital. Only Chen Huang and her daughter were saved, while the two sons died. Subsequently, the police sent Ms. Huang to court to be prosecuted for instigating murder and other crimes, and she was detained pending trial. The details have been reported in the newspapers. This case was brought up again yesterday. The police representative stated that Chen Huang did commit the crime of murder, but according to Article 271, Section 3 of the Criminal Law, attempting joint suicide but committing the crime under Section 1 should exempt her from punishment, and requested a review. After the hearing, the court ordered Chen Huang to be temporarily released into the custody of her brother-in-law, Chen Mo, on bail. The verdict is scheduled to be announced on the 11th.</p>
<h3>Preparations for Xinda Qianzhuang</h3>
<p>Financial industry giants such as Ding Shanggui, Yin Zibai, and Tang Songrong, Chuan Bingzhang, etc., have recently initiated the establishment of Xinda Qianzhuang.

<h3>British Nationals Evacuating from Shanghai: Negotiations Have Not Reached a Result, If Successful, 1,800 People Will Be Evacuated, Over 8,000 British and Indian Residents in the City</h3>
<p>The English-language "Great American Evening News" reports: According to Masaki, the director of the translation department at the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai, negotiations between the Japanese and British governments, if successful, would result in the repatriation of approximately 1,800 British nationals from Shanghai to Lourenço Marques.</p>
<p>Departure Date</p>
<p>The tentative date is the end of this month. The number of 1,800 is an approximate figure suggested in the negotiations. Two ships will be required to transport this number of nationals. The Japanese ship "Ryuta Maru" has already been designated to transport British nationals from Shanghai. The second ship has not yet been determined, pending the conclusion of negotiations between the two countries through the Swiss government,</p>
<p>Ships for Evacuation</p>
<p>It would be premature to decide. The Nippon Yusen Kaisha's "Kamakura Maru" might be used for this purpose. If the "Kamakura Maru" is retained to transport British nationals evacuating from Japan and Manchuria, other Japanese ships will be utilized. Furthermore, the "Conte Verde" and the Japanese ship "Asama Maru" recently sailed from the Eastern Hemisphere carrying American nationals to Lourenço Marques and will carry Japanese nationals evacuating from the Western Hemisphere back here.</p>
<p>The British Association in this city has registered</p>
<p>All British nationals who wish to evacuate. There are over 8,000 British nationals in Shanghai, including those of Indian descent. In addition, many British nationals from the interior have already arrived in Shanghai. It is expected that more British nationals will continue to arrive in Shanghai. The British Association has found suitable accommodation for these people, many of whom are residing at the Columbia Country Club on Great Western Road.</p>

<h3>Infected Area in Nanshi: May Be Locked Down for a Week, Bodies Not Allowed to Be Moved to Funeral Homes, Coffins Should Be Bought and Bodies Placed Inside Immediately in Hospitals</h3>
<p>The true cholera has been discovered in this city, and as many as eight people have been infected, posing a threat to the health of the city's residents this summer. The Datong News Agency reporter records the continuing situation as follows:</p>
<p>Infected Areas May Be Locked Down</p>
<p>Eight cases of true cholera have been discovered in the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Qiaqing Road. The infected areas are all located in the Huining Road area of Nanshi. Therefore, this area may be subject to a one-week epidemic prevention lockdown to carry out disinfection and isolation work to eliminate the spread of germs.</p>
<p>Vaccinations Should Be Administered to Avoid Infection</p>
<p>According to a Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry, if a case of true cholera occurs in a household in the two concessions, the house must be disinfected and sealed off for a week for isolation purposes. Therefore, every resident should quickly get a vaccination to avoid infection and to avoid the inconvenience of having their home sealed off. Do not delay.</p>
<p>Buy Coffins and Collect Bodies Inside Hospitals</p>
<p>Those who die from true cholera after ineffective treatment must have their bodies placed in coffins purchased inside the hospital. They must not be moved to funeral homes to prevent the spread of cholera germs through corpses. Therefore, all epidemic hospitals are following this procedure.</p>
<h3>Yesterday Continued with Heat Waves, Temperature 91 Degrees, Over 400 Cases of Epidemic</h3>
<p>The weather in this city was extremely hot again yesterday. According to a Datong News Agency reporter, the highest temperature yesterday rose to 91 degrees Fahrenheit (33 degrees Celsius). Because the wind was calm, the heat was even more intense. As a result, epidemic patients increased sharply. According to records from the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Qiaqing Road, there were more than 400 outpatients yesterday. All 400 beds in the hospital were also occupied by inpatients.</p>
<h3>Central Hotel Detains a Large Number of Extortionists</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Central Police Department of the Public Concession received a report that a large number of extortionists were hiding in Room 203 of the Central Hotel on Wuma Road. When the detectives arrived at the address, they found many people gathered in the room, so they were all arrested. They are currently being held for investigation.</p>
<h3>Repatriation Certificates: No Issuance in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>According to inquiries made by the reporter at the issuance office for repatriation permits in the Public Works Department Building on Jiangxi Road, the office has resumed issuing permits this morning since it stopped working on the 1st of this month. It is also heard that the office hours have been shortened due to the temporary suspension of the issuance of round-trip permits. In the future, the time for issuing repatriation permits will only be from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and no issuance will be done in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Private Smuggling of Opium Seized: Both Parties Arrested</h3>
<p>Chen Xinggui, Bu Chaoke, Wu Zhiliang, and Xu Shunxiang from Anhui, who are opium traffickers, recently brought 21 taels of opium worth over 2,000 yuan from Wuhu to Shanghai. At 10:40 AM on the morning of the 19th of last month, while passing near Feilun Road outside the Hongkou Bridge, they were seen by Zhu Jinmao from Hai'ning, who pretended to be an investigator from a certain organization and tried to extort money from them. They argued with each other. Fang Fucheng, a detective from the police station, investigated and learned the details. He took the opium and the people involved to the police station. The lawyer representing the legal department prosecuted them for both transporting and robbing opium and demanded that the five defendants be punished. When questioned, Chen Xinggui and the other three admitted to transporting the opium to Shanghai to sell for profit. They each offered to pay 200 yuan to be leniently treated. Zhu Jinmao, the opium robber, gave inconsistent statements. The verdict is scheduled to be announced on the 10th of this month.</p>
<h3>The Guild of Boiled Water Shops Encourages Members to Continue Setting Up Tea Pavilions, Authorities Promise to Find a Solution to the Coal Problem</h3>
<p>The Boiled Water Shop Guild of this city has, in the past year, supervised all member shops to set up tea pavilions on important streets, with remarkable results, benefiting ordinary people and street wanderers. Now that the hot summer is approaching again, the guild still embraces the idea of helping those in need and has again exhorted all members to continue setting up tea pavilions, in order to carry out this benevolent act to the end.</p>
<h3>Recent News on Leprosy Society Fundraising</h3>
<p>The China Leprosy Relief Association's fundraising campaign has been going on for three weeks since its opening, and has received about 70,000 yuan. In addition to Nanji's 5,000 yuan donation, there are many donations of 1,000 yuan and 500 yuan. However, there are only eight days left in the association's fundraising deadline, and it is still short of more than half of the original target. In order to maintain leprosy hospitals across the country and in Shanghai, the association needs at least 150,000 yuan to support the existing work. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will enthusiastically contribute to make this cause a success.</p>
<h3>Jewish Refugee Committee Severes Ties with American Headquarters, Funding Sources Face Serious Difficulties</h3>
<p>Ms. Margaret, the chairman of the Jewish Refugee Relief Committee in this city, revealed yesterday that the committee had received a telegram from Washington stating that the American Headquarters will sever ties with the Shanghai Committee from now on. As a result, tens of thousands of Jewish refugees currently residing in Shanghai will lose economic support, especially the elderly and young, and food assistance will face an unprecedented and serious panic from the end of this month. It is reported that European Jewish refugees in this city have encountered great difficulties in assistance since the second half of last year. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, with the permission of the Japanese authorities, they borrowed a sum of money from neutral parties in this city for six months, because the American Headquarters telegraphed allowing the Shanghai Committee to borrow money from outside for six months and repay it after the war. Now that six months have passed, the American Headquarters has stopped providing assistance, so the situation is serious. All refugee camps may be closed by the end of the month. There were many refugees in the past, but after the war, half of them were gone, and only young children and the elderly remain. If they are disbanded, it will be difficult for them to survive. Currently, the Shanghai Committee is trying to solve their livelihood problems. The cost for each refugee per month is 50 Chu banknotes.</p>
<h3>Maid Holding Young Master Cooling Off, Never Returns</h3>
<p>At No. 152 Stylester Lane, Xujiahui, Room 4 of a certain foreign apartment, resides Attorney Zhan Jifeng, who has been there for years. He has a son named Yigang, who is also married and has a boy who is just over one year old. The family employed a maid, an Anhui native named Wang Ma, 35 years old. Around 8 PM the night before, due to the oppressive heat, she took the child in her arms to cool off outside the door, but she never returned. She disappeared without a trace. After Zhan reported to the French police, detectives went to investigate, but they returned to report to the police chief that there was no progress.</p>
<h3>This Newspaper's Student Aid Fund: Preparations for Application to Begin, Tuition Increases Several Times, Aid Money Insufficient, Striving to Proceed Under Difficult Circumstances, Hoping All Sectors Donate as Much as Possible to Accomplish the Task</h3>
<p>Since the promotion of the third session of this newspaper's student aid fund, it has been deeply appreciated by readers who have generously donated. Various schools have sent letters donating free tuition slots. The material and spiritual assistance given by all parties has made the colleagues of this newspaper more aware of their responsibilities. Now that the time is approaching to start accepting applications, we would like to sincerely reiterate the details of the operation of this session's student aid fund to all sectors.</p>
<p>School Tuition Fees Increase Sharply</p>
<p>The most difficult part of this session's student aid fund is the economic constraint. Although the total amount of donations has now exceeded 40,000 Chu banknotes, which is not less than previous sessions, the tuition fees of schools at all levels have increased sharply in the coming semester. According to an on-site investigation by this newspaper's reporter, primary schools average about 80 to 90 yuan, junior high schools average about 140 to 150 yuan, senior high schools average about 180 to 190 yuan, and universities average about 240 to 250 yuan, all collected in Chu banknotes. The amount of increase is no less than five to six times compared to the previous semester. Therefore, in terms of the number of students who can be assisted, if 1,000 people could be assisted in the previous session, this session can only afford 200 people based on the current aid money received. Furthermore, as the cost of living increases, the number of impoverished students applying for aid will be several times higher than in the past, while the estimated number of those who can receive aid will be several times less than the previous session. All of these actual situations should be understood by enthusiastic people from all walks of life, without the need for further explanation. We only hope that enthusiastic people will keep the welfare of impoverished students in mind and continuously provide assistance, so that the students' studies will not be interrupted as a result.</p>
<p>Welcome Donations for Tuition Slots</p>
<p>In recent days, many schools have sent letters donating free tuition slots, demonstrating enthusiasm and jointly participating in this charitable act. We are very grateful. We have recorded them separately and will publish the school names after compiling them. In the future, we will send letters to recommend outstanding impoverished students to enroll. However, summer tutoring schools, due to the application deadline not yet arriving and the time required for screening, investigation, and review, cannot be guaranteed to be sent, so we are sorry for the generous offer of summer tutoring slots donated by various schools. Due to the limitations of the facts, we hope for understanding. As for the donation of free tuition slots in universities, middle schools, and tutoring schools, we will solemnly recommend students in accordance with the procedures.</p>
<p>The Charitable Actions of Mr. Zhang and Mr. Zhou</p>
<p>This newspaper received a letter from Mr. Zhang Jingcheng yesterday, which said, "Dear Sirs, I am hereby submitting 410 Chu banknotes and pray that they be used for the student aid fund. A small amount, but a slight effort. May your newspaper call on the society even more, give great sympathy to the students, save unnecessary waste, and fulfill the ambitions of young students with a wave of the hand, so as to fulfill one's due obligation to society. Then the youth will be fortunate. Respectfully, Zhang Jingcheng." Mr. Zhou Zhifeng, to thank friends for their birthday wishes, saved money on banquets and donated 300 yuan to student aid, creating blessings for relatives and friends. The enthusiastic charitable actions of the two gentlemen are worthy of emulation. Yesterday, the aid money received included 410 yuan from Zhang Jingcheng, 300 yuan from Zhou Zhifeng, 250 yuan from Longji, 178.68 yuan from the rewards of all the initiators of the National Publishing Co., Ltd., 50 yuan from Xu Aitang, and 10 yuan from Wang Jinfang, totaling 1,198.68 Chu banknotes. Adding the previous balance of 42,444.76 yuan, the total balance is 43,642.44 yuan.</p>

<h3>Sanletang Scholarship for Students: Twenty Students to be Selected This Term</h3>
<p>In view of the difficult times, we have specially saved on expenses and accumulated some funds to reward and assist hardworking students and pay their tuition fees. The following are the provisional rules:</p>
<p>Students who are currently (or newly entering) middle school and whose families are indeed in financial difficulty and unable to pay tuition fees should state the true situation in writing for investigation.</p>
<p>Those whose academic performance and conduct in the previous semester were rated B or above should submit school certificates for review.</p>
<p>Applicants for the scholarship should provide a detailed description of their personal resume and family situation in the application, along with school certificates and personal photos, and mail them to "Qi Residence, No. 1, Lane 479, Kangti Road (opposite the post office)" for collection.</p>
<p>The deadline for receiving applications is from July 15th to 30th.</p>
<p>After preliminary investigation and review, a notice will be sent for a scheduled examination (written or oral).</p>
<p>The number of scholarships is tentatively set at 20 for this term. After the selection, a notice will be sent to submit the school's payment slip for payment of tuition fees.</p>
<h3>Organizing an Old Book Exchange</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the high price of paper and the lack of teaching materials, Wang Gongwei and several university students have jointly invested in the organization of the Five-Star Old Book Exchange, which is large in scale and widely collects books. This organization is indeed newly established, and its future development has unlimited hope. Its business is mainly exchange, and consignment sales and consignment purchases are secondary. If students have used textbooks that they want to exchange for the current semester, the society can assess the price and exchange them. Or, if there are books that are not suitable and you want to transfer them, you can set a reasonable price and entrust the society for consignment sales. If you want to purchase teaching materials or reference textbooks, you can go to the society to choose them. Otherwise, you can specify the publisher and book name, and the society can purchase them on your behalf. The price is lower than the market price. All colleagues are purely serving the student community faithfully, and the fees charged are about 10%. The address of the society is temporarily located at No. 102, Lane 370, Xiaoshadu Road (intersection of Wuding Road), inside Jiande Elementary and Middle School. Brochures are available upon request.</p>

<h3>Second Summer Light Cup Basketball Tournament: Huanan and Nanhua to Compete in the Final Tomorrow, at Xia Guang in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The champions of the "Xia" and "Guang" groups in the second Summer Light Cup Basketball Tournament are Huanan and Nanhua teams respectively. The championship final will be held at Xia Guang Middle School tomorrow (Thursday) at 6:45 PM. The two teams will perform a "brotherly squabble." Nanhua has always been a dominant force. Huanan was formed by its division, so the strength is difficult to distinguish. At that time, it will be a family feud, and it is unknown who will win. Before the game, there will be another game in the Xia group between the Qiangxing team and the V team. Both sides have each lost once. This battle will determine the runner-up of the Xia group. Both teams will do their best to compete. The game will end here and the closing ceremony will be announced. Tomorrow's schedule is as follows: Qiangxing vs. V team (Xia group) at 6:00 PM Huanan vs. Nanhua (final) at 6:45 PM</p>
<h3>Yingming Sports Association Organizes Summer Small Football Tournament</h3>
<p>Registration starts now and ends on the 12th. Mr. Ma Jitao, the president of the Yingming Sports Association in this city, has always spared no effort in promoting sports. In order to give young people who love football more opportunities to practice during the summer vacation, he has initiated the Yingming Cup Summer Small Football League. The football field is borrowed from the Xuhui Middle School outdoor playground (enter and exit from the Xujiahui Xuzhen Road entrance). Registration starts now and ends on the 12th of this month (Sunday). Only Group B and the youth group can participate. Group B is limited to 24 teams, and the youth group is limited to 8 teams. The registration fee and deposit are 20 yuan each. A single round-robin system is adopted. Group B is divided into three divisions, and the champions of each division will compete for the overall championship. The prizes are as follows: the overall champion will receive a large silver cup donated by Ma Jitao, and the runner-up, third place, and youth group champion will each receive a small silver cup or silver shield. There will also be medals for each winning team member to encourage them. Registration locations: Ma Jitao, No. 25 Nianwu New Village, Fuxu Road, Wang Wenxi, No. 20, Lane 498, North Suzhou Road, Gu Zhifan, No. 10, Lane 320, Shut De Fang, Yao Zhujiao Road</p>
<h3>A Small Town on the Sujia Road: A Major Sheng Spinning Production Area, Summer Cloth and Kao Silk are in Short Supply, Only Sheng Spinning is Unique, Full Factory Silk Electric Spinning is the Best</h3>
<p>For summer clothing materials, lightness and coolness are the top priorities. Therefore, Jiangxi summer cloth, Guangdong Kao silk, and Sheng spinning have become the favorites of summer clothing materials. However, since the war, the source of Jiangxi summer cloth has been cut off, and Guangdong Kao silk has also become almost extinct due to being under control. According to merchants who deal in these goods in Shanghai, almost all of the summer cloth and Kao silk in the Shanghai market are inventory. Only Sheng spinning is still being shipped from the production area to Shanghai. Now let's talk about Sheng spinning for consumers' reference.</p>
<p>Shengze Specialty</p>
<p>Sheng spinning is the abbreviation of Shengze silk spinning. Shengze is a small town belonging to Wujiang County, Jiangsu Province, and is a relatively important station on the Sujia Railway. The entire town has a population of about 30,000 to 40,000. The town area is not large, but it is unusually prosperous and lively because it is a silk industry area. It is known as Little Shanghai and is the leader among the towns in Wujiang County. Wherever the flames of war have reached, the tragic scene is inevitable. Shengze has not suffered much from the fires of war, but it is enough for people to see the traces of war. Fortunately, the town is a silk industry area, so the bleak scene is still lighter than in other towns.</p>
<p>Handicrafts</p>
<p>Sheng spinning was originally a handmade product. Almost everyone in Shengze knows how to use a spinning machine. The weaving machines used are old-fashioned wooden machines, but in recent years, some have used electricity. The so-called electric spinning refers to the silk spun by electricity. The silk used for spinning has factory silk and native silk. Factory silk is cleaner than native silk, so full factory silk electric spinning is the best among Sheng spinning, followed by native silk electric spinning. In addition, there is Guang Kou spinning. Guang Kou spinning includes pure white, striped, and checkered patterns, and even foreign spinning, which is the worst among Sheng spinning. Recently, because factory native silk electric spinning is expensive, some people even use foreign spinning after processing to impersonate and sell it. However, such a practice is despised by the Shengze natives, because it would damage the brand. Most of the time, it is the trick of amateur non-local merchants.</p>
<p>Real Silk Raw Materials</p>
<p>Sheng spinning originally only had a pure white color. Jacquard and checkered patterns are later developments. There was a time when artificial silk was mixed with silk, or foreign thread was mixed with the weft. Recently, foreign thread is expensive and artificial silk is also in short supply. Therefore, Sheng spinning is as it used to be, with every strand being real silk. The advantage of Sheng spinning is that it is light and thin, and the price is cheaper than products from other regions. Every summer, Sheng spinning becomes active in the Shanghai market. Men use it to make underwear or suit shirts, women use it to make cheongsams or underwear, and foreign spinning is most suitable for lining robes and silk cotton clothes. Because Sheng spinning is a handmade product, the products cannot reach standardization. Although the length and width vary little, this gives people an excuse, and it is often difficult during transportation, which inevitably increases a lot of consumption for silk merchants. Generally, each bolt of Sheng spinning is about two feet wide and about 18 yards long, which is 45 feet. Each bolt of Sheng spinning can be used to make about six or seven men's suit shirts, more than three sets of men's shorts, and the remaining silk can be used to make a woman's cheongsam. The shirts that are popular this year, such as small checkered and striped patterns, are mostly made of Sheng spinning.</p>
<p>Current Market Price</p>
<p>The best pure factory silk electric spinning among Sheng spinning was only a few dozen yuan per bolt before the war. The price has increased day by day after the war, and its price is even more expensive today. In early May of this year, full factory silk electric spinning was only 300 yuan per bolt in legal currency, native silk was only 270 to 280 yuan, checkered Guang Kou spinning was 260 to 270 yuan per bolt, and striped was about 240 yuan. By the end of May, the price jumped, increasing by one-half of the original price. After switching to Chu banknotes, the price has increased even more than the old price, that is, the price at this time is more than double that of early May. The reason why Sheng spinning is becoming more expensive is all due to the soaring price of silk. For example, Wuxi factory silk has always been the raw material for Sheng spinning, and now the price of factory silk is soaring, and the cost of Sheng silk is increasing day by day. Its price must also rise linearly. In addition, the cost of living in the interior is increasing day by day, and the wages are expensive, so the silk weaving workers and silk merchants are not willing to sell at low prices. Although Sheng spinning is becoming more expensive day by day, it is still cheap compared to silk goods from other places. Compared with the skyrocketing price of cloth and foreign house silk, the situation of Sheng silk is not too excessive.</p>
<p>The same is true for each bolt of Sheng spinning, but the quality is quite different. Some are fine and clean, while others are rough and uneven. The price will inevitably follow with high and low. Generally, the goods made by Shengze merchants are carefully selected. Even if there are rough and dark goods, they will be stated in advance, and they will never voluntarily damage the brand. (Gan)</p>

<h3>Sudden Large-Scale Release of Public Bonds; Each Falls Around One Yuan</h3>
<p>In the gray market for public bonds, yesterday's market initially remained stable. However, a large number of bonds were suddenly released, causing prices to fall. This further dampened confidence. Previously, the bulls were confident because prices mostly rose with few declines, so they rarely sold. Since the recent volatility, the bulls have become less secure. This is just a partial fluctuation, and not necessarily indicative of a general rise or fall. The cracks have not yet become obvious, and it is hoped that the bulls will work hard to save the situation, which is still quite manageable. Yesterday, because of companies like Yi Li, Wu He, and Heng Yu, bulls released large quantities. Reportedly, a large portion of these sales represent small financial institutions liquidating their positions, also indicating a lack of confidence. As a result, prices uniformly continued to fall by seven or eight cents to one yuan and forty cents, with transactions of about one million two hundred to thirty thousand yuan. A summary table is provided below.</p>
<h3>Strong Buying Interest in Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market for Chinese merchant stocks remained strong. Shanghai Cotton Textiles rose by as much as twenty-four yuan. New Pharmaceuticals also stopped falling and turned upwards. Cultural and financial stocks were also steady. Transactions were brisk. Detailed price tables for each market are listed below.</p>
<h3>Cloth Market Remains Stagnant</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cloth market did not escape the trend of stagnation. Confidence was relatively stable. New orders for twelve-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth opened at one hundred and ninety yuan and closed at two hundred and two yuan. "Four Gentlemen" serge fluctuated around seven yuan and seventy or eighty cents. There were few transactions in factory cloth, and prices did not change much. Sixteen-pound "Globe" coarse cloth was currently quoted at one hundred and eighty-nine yuan, and "Flying Swan" at one hundred and eighty-five yuan. Twelve-pound "Globe" fine cloth was one hundred and seventy-three yuan and fifty cents. There were occasional transactions. Due to seasonal factors, printed fabrics saw even fewer transactions. "Jasper Scholar's Gown" poplin was quoted at six yuan and five cents, "Volleyball" yarn poplin at three yuan and seventy cents, "Three Sheep" serge at six yuan and thirty-five cents. New orders for "Peach Blossom" women's fabric opened at two yuan and seventy-six cents, reached a high of two yuan and eighty-three cents, and closed at two yuan and eighty-two and a half cents, it was said.</p>
<h3>Difficult Situation for Retailers of Woolen Fabrics</h3>
<p>Since the authorities implemented price controls, retailers of woolen fabrics have successively lowered their posted prices. Because the symptom was treated instead of the root cause, the wholesale prices on the market remain firm, exceeding retail prices. The prices quoted by the factories are even higher than the wholesale prices on the market. According to the factories, the new cost of production makes higher prices inevitable, and the lack of raw materials suggests an impending shortage. This is because water and electricity rates have increased by two-thirds since the old currency was changed to the new currency, workers' food expenses continue to rise, salaries have more than doubled from the old to the new currency, and prices of wool and cotton raw materials are high and scarce. All these facts demonstrate that everything is going in the opposite direction.</p>
<h3>Strict Enforcement of Two-to-One Exchange Rate; Grain Merchants Fearful; Beneficial to the Public</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for miscellaneous grains suddenly turned quiet, because the authorities of the French Concession issued an order through the association, informing fellow merchants that they should sell at a rate of two-to-one, converting to Central Reserve Bank notes based on the prices from May 26th to 28th of this year, and must not exceed this rate. Otherwise, once discovered, they would be severely punished without leniency. Therefore, everyone was apprehensive, and both supply and demand were lacking. Only Sheng Ji bean cakes were traded, five hundred pieces of old stock from an unspecified month at fifty-two yuan, and five hundred pieces of new stock from April at fifty-eight yuan. However, the source has not yet been unblocked, and the underlying trend remains strong.</p>
<h3>Sugar Rationing for June and July Combined</h3>
<p>It is heard that the sugar rations for retailers for last month and this month have been decided to be combined, with a total of 35,000 bags, and purchase certificate number 10 can be issued. Yesterday, the sugar stocks of the cooperative business office saw light trading and continued to weaken slightly, with coarse granulated sugar at three hundred and nineteen and a half yuan, down one yuan. There were no transactions in red granulated sugar stocks.</p>
<h3>Jellyfish Head and Skin Are Expensive</h3>
<p>Jellyfish heads and skins produced in Ningbo have become increasingly scarce recently, and inventories are low. However, the sales channels are quite active, so prices continue to rise. Currently, the market price for jellyfish heads is one hundred and sixty yuan, up by one-fourth, and for jellyfish skin, two hundred and fifty yuan, up by one-fifth. The market is generally stable.</p>
<h3>Fresh Daylily from Xuzhou Rises</h3>
<p>New daylily from the Xuzhou producing area has begun to appear sporadically. Because Shanghai still has inventories and buyers are unwilling to pay high prices, most have no intention of rushing to buy. It is heard that buyers from Nanjing, with their stocks depleted, have been purchasing from there, causing prices in the producing area to tighten instead of loosen, with prices having already increased by ten yuan in national currency, showing signs of further tightening.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes in Decline</h3>
<p>Cigarette selling prices continue to weaken. Due to weather conditions, the number of customers visiting the street has decreased slightly, and many scattered sellers are releasing their stocks, creating a situation of more supply than demand. Yesterday's transactions included "Great Britain" brand at eight thousand eight hundred yuan, "Old Knife" brand at five thousand seven hundred and fifty yuan, "Pinhai" brand at four thousand eight hundred yuan, "Wuhua" brand at three thousand eight hundred and fifty yuan, "Fairy" brand at three thousand seven hundred yuan, fifty-stick "Great Front Gate" at two thousand three hundred yuan per carton, ten-stick "Great Front Gate" at two thousand three hundred and fifty yuan, twenty-stick "Great Front Gate" at two thousand four hundred yuan, Japanese cigarette "Golden Gun" brand at one thousand three hundred and fifty yuan, "Golden Building" brand at two thousand and twenty yuan, "Red Rose" brand at one thousand one hundred and fifty yuan, "Quanlu" brand at one thousand seven hundred and fifty yuan, "Guide" brand at one thousand two hundred and seventy yuan, national cigarette "Golden Mouse" brand at one thousand and seventy yuan, "Beautiful" brand at three thousand and fifty yuan, and "Pyramid" at two thousand nine hundred yuan, all slightly lower than the previous day. The "Golden Gun" brand saw brisk trading yesterday, while few other brands were traded, and the overall momentum was in decline.</p>
<h3>Daily Necessities Market Continues Downward Trend</h3>
<p>The market for daily necessities is showing a downward trend because the price of cigarettes continues to weaken slightly, inevitably softening confidence. Trades included "Phoenix" brand at three thousand one hundred yuan, "Beautiful" brand at three thousand two hundred yuan, miscellaneous brands at two thousand two hundred yuan, "Guben" soap at three hundred and thirty yuan, "Bai Xiangmao" soap at two hundred and forty-five yuan, "Arrow Knife" soap at two hundred and sixty yuan, "Huang Xiangmao" at two hundred and ten yuan, "White Rice" brand candles at one hundred and twenty yuan, and "Monk's Hat" brand at one hundred and fifteen yuan, with only slight differences from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Abalone Shells Remain Firm and Expensive</h3>
<p>Abalone shells, also known as Shi Jue Ming, have been in short supply for a long time, and market inventories are very low. Therefore, selling prices have not weakened, but have instead tightened. Yesterday, the market price was five hundred yuan per dan [unit of weight], whereas normally it is only several tens of yuan. The difference between now and then cannot be measured in common terms.</p>
<h3>Pangolin Scales Remain Firm</h3>
<p>Pangolin scales have been in short supply for a long time, and market inventories are extremely low. Therefore, prices are quite high and have remained so for a long time. Yesterday, the market price for clean pangolin scales was five thousand yuan. Pangolin skin is out of stock and the trend is firm.</p>

<h3>To Promote Kunqu Opera, It Is Necessary to Cultivate Flute Players First</h3>
<p>— Owner of Sixin Pavilion</p>
<p>Musical composition is used to harmonize the body and mind. Southern tunes are relaxed, with gentle phrases and melodies. Northern tunes are heroic, inspiring, and energetic, representing the sounds of harmony and refinement during prosperous times. Therefore, it flourishes when order is restored from chaos and declines when order gives way to chaos. In the past three to five years, the sounds of songs in Shanghai have been diverse and jumbled, with a decline in positive energy. If one wants to listen to clear and fluent music, one can only seek it in Kunqu opera. However, the famous Kunqu performers have already separated, leaving a fragmented situation. Zhu Chuanming pairs with Yu Zhenfei, Zhang Chuanfang mostly teaches female amateurs, Zheng Chuanjian trains students at a drama school, and Wang Chuansong switches to the Suzhou opera path, while flute players are like lonely stars after dawn, with no new ones emerging. However, Shanghai Beijing opera amateurs strive for improvement, meticulously studying stage movements and tracing back to the majestic steps of Kunqu opera. In plays such as "Selling the Horse" and "Lin Chong Flees at Night," a good flute is indispensable, otherwise, they would be less impressive. "Drunken Concubine" has a leisurely melody, and storytelling gains a desolate tone, both thanks to the accompaniment of the flute. However, the fee for a flute player is meager, earning only two or three yuan per day, which is not enough to sustain a livelihood. No wonder they switch to other professions, leading to the decline of this art. Recently, according to my knowledge, the only flute players left are Li Yaxiong, Shen Sanming, Jin Shousheng, Zhu Shuijing, and Jiang Gengsheng. Li has a fondness for indulgence, and his spirit is not good. Jin and Shen have the best flute styles and know many operas. Shen needs rest and recuperation and is reluctant to play for anyone except old friends of more than five years. Zhu and Jiang play in fewer operas, but they are diligent and tireless, supporting various troupes and barely keeping them alive. My friend Mr. Chu said that a Beijing opera rehearsal of "Selling the Horse" cost over three hundred gold yuan on stage. Kunqu opera amateurs advocate thrift, cultivate virtue, and are humble and respectful. However, cultivating flute players is especially urgent. A proactive approach would be to urge various music societies and amateur troupes to recruit young children, four to six per troupe, to learn the flute daily. They should strive for accuracy in learning specific melodies and tunes, with monthly tests to assess performance and determine rewards and punishments. Secondly, select female children as flute students, combining singing and learning stage movements, with a fixed number of hours per week. They can still pursue other occupations, so that economic resources and time are not wasted. On Sundays, select morally upright stories from opera scripts and invite troupe members to lecture voluntarily, first instilling the essence of the opera to achieve gradual progress. Pingsheng, Gengchun, and Xiaoshe societies each have writers and musicians who can help each other. If one can guide and encourage them in this way, achievements will be made within a year. This is a general outline, and I hope enthusiasts will improve and promote it.</p>
<h3>Monkey Opera Master Hao Zhenji Passes Away</h3>
<p>— Owner of Meihua Pavilion</p>
<p>Hao Zhenji, a master of monkey opera in the Northern Kunqu troupe, enjoyed a long-standing reputation in the Beijing-Tianjin area. In recent years, due to his advanced age, he retired to his home and was unwilling to showcase his extraordinary skills. Recently, Bai Yunsheng, a famous young Kunqu opera actor, organized a Kunqu opera festival in Tianjin and originally planned to invite Hao to join the joint performance and even announced it in posters. However, Hao did not appear on stage on the opening day of the Kunqu opera festival. The general audience suspected that it was a trick played by Bai, simply creating publicity to attract attention. However, the sad news came that Hao had passed away suddenly at the end of last month (died at his residence in Ya Hongqiao, Yutian County). A master of his generation passed away with his skills, and another hero of the older generation has weakened. This is not only a misfortune for the Kunqu troupe but also a great loss for the opera world.</p>
<h3>Readers' Opinions on Movie Theaters Discontinuing Program Guides</h3>
<p>— Hui Ying</p>
<p>"Since the announcement that Chinese films will discontinue issuing program guides from July 1st, the general movie fans inevitably feel disappointed. I would like to suggest two compromise solutions:</p>
<p>Whenever a new film is released, the theater or film company can issue a special publication about the new film, which audiences can purchase if they wish to read it.</p>
<p>Before the release of a new film, an advertisement summarizing the story can be published in Shen Bao and Xin Bao newspapers. This is also a solution when there are no other options. (Xing Meng)</p>
<p>When a certain new film is about to be released, the summary of the film can be published in the supplement of the newspaper.</p>
<p>The summary of the film can be handwritten and posted in the places where photos are displayed in each theater. The summary does not need to be long, but it should be concise and well-organized. (Zheng Xiangling)</p>
<p>Before the show starts, the theater authorities can use slides to show the audience a very brief summary of the story."</p>
<h3>Anecdotes about Suzhou Storytelling</h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>In the past, there were the "Four Great Vajras" in the world of Suzhou storytelling: Ma, Zhao, Yao, and Wang. Ma Rufei was famous for "The Pearl Pagoda," Zhao Xiangzhou was famous for "Drawing a Golden Phoenix," Yao Shizhang was famous for "Water Margin," and Wang Shiquan was famous for "Records of Retribution." There were also the so-called "Big Three Sacrifices," which were Zhu Yaoting and Yao Sheng's "Double Phoenixes," Yang Yuecuo and Xingcuo's "The Pearl Pagoda," and Wu Biquan and Xigeng's "The Tale of the White Snake." Because these three stories each had their own unique flavor and expressiveness, and "Zhu Yang Wu" sounds like "Pig, Sheep, Fish" in Chinese, they were named "Big Three Sacrifices."</p>
<p>Two years ago, someone established a "New Medical Specialization Training Class" at Zhonghua Vocational Supplementary School, recruiting junior high school students and providing two semesters of training with evening classes. The teachers were Fan Yanqiao, Lu Dan'an, Xu Zhuodai, etc. The stated purpose was: "To establish a unique style in the art of storytelling, to have appropriate value in literature, to have unique skills in the profession, not to discuss politics, not to involve obscure topics, and not to be obscene." However, no news about this specialization training class has been heard since then. Perhaps it has been discontinued due to various difficulties. The storytelling profession has a close relationship with social education. The current "Suzhou Storytelling" and "Pinghua Storytelling" both need to be improved. Therefore, it is unknown whether this type of specialization training class can be revived.</p>
<h3>Chatting About Tyrone Power</h3>
<p>— Tao Shunsheng</p>
<p>The handsome young Tyrone Power was born on May 5th in Ohio, USA. When he graduated from high school, he performed in a play called "Officer Number 666." In this play, his acting skills were praised by his father, who personally trained him. His father was originally famous for performing Shakespearean plays. Soon, Tyrone Power played the old man in "The Merchant of Venice" in Chicago. After two years of hard work, he finally gained the attention of Hollywood and began working as a movie actor. In "Jesse James," he played a fearless robber, with a "bandit's accent" that gave the audience a new impression. His calm, serious, and admirable expression was like a brave and tender hero from Liangshan Mountain.</p>
<p>In "The Mark of Zorro," we saw his swordsmanship for the first time; in the recently released "Blood and Sand," we further appreciated his bullfighting skills. He is truly a versatile actor. From his works, we can see that he was so ordinary the year before the filming of "In Old Chicago," but after "In Old Chicago," he not only jumped to the throne of the silver screen but also became the idol of women around the world. Later, he starred with Norma Shearer in "Marie Antoinette," with Alice Faye and Don Ameche in "Alexander's Ragtime Band," and with Anna Bella and Loretta Young in "Suez," all of which were excellent. From then on, he enjoyed unprecedented fame.</p>
<p>The gentle and elegant Tyrone Power is so serious about his work, and his acting skills are improving day by day. I believe that people who work hard will have a bright future. Tyrone Power is promising.</p>
<p>There also seems to be a beautiful young actor in Shanghai, who is praised as the "Oriental Tyrone Power." Unfortunately, he does not express his beauty well, nor does he reveal his talent in his work, which is a bit disappointing to the public.</p>
<h3>Famous Movie Star Tyrone Power</h3>
<h3>Unique Skills of Old Opera Performers</h3>
<p>— Wu Yin</p>
<p>Chinese people have a selfish mentality and are unwilling to pass on their most proficient skills to others. Many old opera performers have this habit, so many unique skills can no longer be seen on stage, which is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>When Lao Tan sang Song Jiang in "Wulongyuan," when Yan Xijiao forced him to write a divorce letter, the square scarf on his head would stand straight up, truly "hair standing on end in anger." Wang Yaoqing's "Changbanpo," when Lady Mi took off her clothes and threw herself into the well, was swift and clean, leaving no trace. Chen Xicai, playing Wang Ying in "Hujiazhuang," could fight with Hu Sanniang in a crouching position. Xiao Cuihua's drunken performance was unmatched. Chen Delin's slipping steps in "Yubei Pavilion" were divine. Zhu Suyun's crying in "Yuejiazhuang" was like the innocence of a child. Shang Heyu could spin the hammer freely in his hand in "Siping Mountain." When Yang Xiaolou's Jiang Wei carried his bow and retreated in "Iron Cage Mountain," he lowered his head and turned around, causing his hair and long sideburns to separate to the left and right, which was extremely beautiful. Yu Shuyan could kick his shoes up and let them fall gently on his head in "Wen Qiao Makes Trouble at the Government Office." In addition, the facial makeup of Huang Runfu and Qian Jinfu, and the movements of Zhu Guafang and Jiuzhenfeng, were all at the peak of perfection, and no one among the current performers can compare.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why Chinese old opera cannot progress, but this selfish mentality is undoubtedly a very important reason. It is hoped that performers with a broad vision will eliminate this kind of bad mentality and try to pass on their skills to future generations. Otherwise, the future of old opera will inevitably gradually decline into a dangerous state of destruction.</p>
<h3>Scenes from the Entertainment World</h3>

<h3>The Origin of the Opera "Evil Tiger Village"</h3>
<p>— Zhong Tang</p>
<p>The opera "Evil Tiger Village" is a story from the late Qing Dynasty, during the Daoguang and Xianfeng periods. The entire opera is based on the essence of the story of Huang Tianba, Pu Tianpeng, and Wu Tianqiu from the "Shi Gong An" cases, about their breaking of their sworn brotherhood. This is a legitimate opera for martial actors. Anyone who has seen this opera knows the plot well. However, few people know who was behind the initial arrangement and the reason why this opera was created. Here, I will briefly describe what I know for reference.</p>
<p>During the Daoguang and Xianfeng periods of the late Qing Dynasty, there was a martial actor named Shen Xiaoqing, who was part of the Chunhao Beijing Opera Troupe and enjoyed a good reputation. He was also a talented playwright. He had a close relationship with Jin Laojiao, an official of the Qing court's Ministry of Justice. One day, Jin and Shen were strolling leisurely when they suddenly saw a beautiful young woman standing at an alleyway, looking romantic. She sent seductive glances with her eyes, and Jin was tempted to flirt with her, but Xiaoqing stopped him, scolding him for being indecent. When the sun set, they each returned home. Since then, Jin had repeatedly searched for her踪跡, but all in vain, causing him to get angry with Shen and think of ways to take revenge to vent his anger. One day, Xiaoqing fell ill, and Jin encouraged him to take opium, which cured his illness. When he fell ill a second time, Jin used the same method to encourage him to take opium, while secretly reporting him to the authorities, and he was imprisoned. At this time, Jin's anger was relieved. When Shen learned of Jin's conspiracy in prison, he felt depressed and wanted to write a play to accuse Jin. After carefully considering the story of Huang Tianba, Pu Tianpeng, and Wu Tianqiu in the "Shi Gong An" cases, who were also sworn brothers, but later became enemies due to different ambitions, leading to the breaking of their sworn brotherhood, Pu Tianpeng and Wu Tianqiu harmed Tianba, which was unkind. However, Tianba's killing of Pu Tianpeng's entire family was even more cruel. Therefore, the entire opera was based on this theme, and "Evil Tiger Village" was created.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Storm</h3>
<p>— He Jiawen</p>
<p>Six, a snap of the fingers</p>
<p>Before long, it was time for dinner. According to Mrs. Chen's wishes, the servant was asked to go to the street to buy a catty of good Chen Shao wine. Wei Cheng said, "I dare not. I don't drink alcohol, and even less so during mourning." Mrs. Chen gave up on that. But she also thought that she should borrow a guest from the neighbor's house, because she herself was a woman and was observing the popular June vegetarian diet, and no one could be spared from the family to entertain. Wei Cheng quickly stopped her, saying, "If Auntie does that, it means you don't consider me as a grandson." Wei Cheng blocked Mrs. Chen's suggestion again. He watched the servant bring out the dishes, piling up a table full. Wei Cheng wanted to show that he was not an outsider, and Mrs. Chen wanted him to eat, so he ate. He originally only ate two bowls of rice, but at the Chen's house, he added half a bowl. Mrs. Chen still said that he was being too polite.</p>
<p>After eating, Guoqi and Guofang had not returned. Wei Cheng knew that Mrs. Chen had not eaten yet and said with a smile, "I saw a few books in their brother and sister's room. I'll go flip through them. Auntie, please eat your meal. It's best not to entertain me." Wei Cheng went alone into Guofang's room and saw a soft mat laid on the iron bed, with a pillow and a towel blanket piled at the head of the bed. From this, he knew that the family was indeed waiting for her return. He looked into Guoqi's room, and it was the same arrangement. He randomly took a book from the rattan bookshelf, not looking at the book, and walked to Guofang's bed, intending to sit down but not yet sitting when the servant wrung a towel. He wiped his face and quickly started reading the book. The servant went out, and unconsciously, he sat down. There was an old-fashioned armchair with a backrest and a round stool in front of the bed, but he didn't sit on either of them. It wasn't until he sat down that he realized he was sitting on Guofang's bed. Since he had sat down, so be it. There was no need to overcorrect and say that he shouldn't have sat there. Unexpectedly, the servant came again with a cup of cool tea, which forced him to stand up straight, take the tea from the servant, and quickly sit down, but he sat on the round stool. The round stool was more than an inch lower than the height of the bed. Wei Cheng, using his experience of sitting on the bed to sit on the round stool, was suddenly startled, and some of the tea in the cup spilled on his hand. (123)</p>
