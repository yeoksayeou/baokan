<h3>南市安老院</h3>
<p>老人，除非是你我自己的父母，要我們耐心地服事他一星期或一個月，任何人都會　着眉認為不是一件美差。若是請你三年五年長期地服事一個不相干的老頭子或一個老太婆，你或許認為和你開頑笑。然而現在居然有人肯做，並且不要分文酬勞，並日服事的不只是一個老人，而是幾十百個，並且終身做去，經常替這些老人沿門托鉢。這在我們歷史上，除了一個興學的義丐武訓以外，確沒有見過第二個例。可是現在竟有這樣的奇蹟，而且這奇跋不遠不近，就在我們的眼前。</p>
<p>說起甫市的安老院，誰也有些耳熟，恍惚不過是一個收養貧苦無吿的老人機關而已。但事實却並不那麽簡單。在一個所謂慈善機關裹，主事者按時簽到，細心督察，已經算盡了　　職責，定要他如何「　必躬親」，也不過是那末一句話而已。然而南市安老院中的修女，通稱為「貧人小妹或姆姆」，都不折不扣歡欣踴躍地做到了這一點。全院男女老人三百五十位，食時由她們侍應，起臥由她們扶持，病時由她們不分晝夜的看護，衣服由她們洗滌伙食由她們烹飪，甚至有幾位能鍾不堪的，還要她們將扶着更衣人浴，死時則伴護撫慰，親視含險。實際上即使有孝子順孫的人家，也不見得準能事到這些窮苦老人的晚福！</p>
<p>安老院裏的修女，計　國籍的十四人，外國籍的二十人，都是立誓守貞，終身為老人服務的。她們照例不得有田地財產，以為生利之資，所以常年開支給養，全憑她們　日乞化而來。不問寒暑，不避風雨，數十年來如一日。這種牛淡而偉大的犧牲精神，在目前的社會裏，眞値得欽佩和讚揚。</p>
<p>可是她們所期望於社會的，絕對不是什麽欽佩讚揚，而是大量　同情和援助。時下道年頭兒市面蕭條，物價髙漲，院中每月食米要七十五石，一切用度，也要一萬五千元。可是原來有錢的施主，近來漸覺力不從心，愛莫能助。她們不替自己愁，却替那些靠她們活命的老人上愁。「巧婦艱為無米炊」，以後日子眞不知如何過下去？然而她們有堅決的信仰，她們相信在人類文明社會中，儘還有些俠腸義胆的好善仕女，決不忍坐視她們的事業無以為繼。她們在日夜希望着有力的人加以援手。不論金錢，食物，衣履，不計多寡，不問優劣，一　　受，　　　　　　經濟動蕩叫苦連天的時局中，還是在這　天地泣鬼神的事業上「用脫兩鈿」，替自己和兒孫造福吧！</p>

<h3>協助工局部　預防霍亂</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>最近本市發現眞性霍亂多起，於是工部局，為謀全市人民安全起見，進一步實行預防，我們為保障自身及家庭健康，自然應該與當局，取密切的合作。</p>
<p>霍亂菌是在一八八三年，由髙區（KOCH）氏發明，這種病菌，往往滋長在水中，罹患的病人，吐瀉交作，而病者的四週以及糞便，都是霍亂傳染的媒介，所以我們立刻應該注意下列各點：</p>
<p>一，垃圾桶的蓋，應該蓋好，切勿開啟，使蒼蠅無從進去，因為蒼蠅是病菌的媒介。</p>
<p>二，一切蔬菜等食品必須洗凈，並須煮沸，然後取食。</p>
<p>三，所有飲水，必需煮沸，萬勿使生水入口。</p>
<p>四，遇有霍亂病人，所有他附近的一切，立刻實行消毒。</p>
<p>五，保藏的菜肴，必須用紗罩蓋好。</p>
<p>六，自動向防疫針注射處注射防疫針。</p>
<h3>扶育子女的三種態度</h3>
<p>— 靜</p>
<p>扶育子女，實在可以說最重要的是父母們所取的態度，而下列三種，尤其是最重要的。</p>
<p>一，虛心的態度：這並不是說做父母的自己應該一點也沒有自信力，而意思是應該不取一種肯定的態度。向來父母的主張終是不會錯的，其實並不如此，我們應該勇於認錯，即使在子女的面前，也可以認錯，譬如說你的大兒子對你說：「你向來不許我做這樣做那樣，為什麽弟弟可以照着他自己的意思去做呢？一你就可以說：「孩子，我們終不免有錯的，尤其當你幼年的時候，因為你是我們第一個孩子，一這樣父母和子女之間的情感會很快的增進起來，而子女決不會因此而失去他們尊敬父母的心理。</p>
<p>二，涵養的態度：有許多做父母的，一點沒有涵養的功夫，一遇到失意的事，就把東西很重的處置，或者把門重重的關上，或是在屋子裏跳脚，或是把貓狗踢出門外，再不然把子女無緣無故地責罵敲打，這些對於子女方面，都足以留一個很壞的印象。</p>
<p>在家庭裏，規矩是不得不有的，然而凡事終要用沉着的態度去應付，如果做父母的一味暴躁從事，那末子女們也要因此而學樣了。</p>
<p>三，寬容的熊度：每一個人是不能沒有過失的，尤其是缺少人生經騐的子女們，所以做父母的要從子女們的立塲觀察他們的行為，從而逐漸敎導他們以種種必要智識。如果祗定出了很高的標準而不從下層入手，決不能使子女養成良好的習慣。</p>
<p>但這裏所說的寬容是平心靜氣的扶育子女，而給予他們一點餘地，並不是一味容忍任憑他們去胡作亂為。</p>
<h3>霍亂症之預防</h3>
<p>— 兪立人</p>
<p>可怕的眞實性霍亂，本市已迭有發現，喪性頃刻，蔓延堪虞，無怪個個談虎色變，人人慄慄危懼，怎樣認識本症，如何可以預防，自非嚴加注意不可。</p>
<p>按本症之病原，為「，」形桿菌，為他症所無，菌形强半微曲，校螺菌粗短，叉有多菌連成螺形，或S形，在食物中能活七八天，在蠅腸中至少可活三天，遇乾爆及酸類則速死，本病傳染媒介中之緊要者，約述於左。</p>
<p>霍亂病人之排洩物，濫投水中或在河濱，井邊，洗濯病者衣服食器等類，使水中常混有霍亂菌，一旦吸飲極易感染，夏秋多蠅之時，亦極易於傳染。</p>
<p>本症約可分為三種，　單純性霍亂下痢，一日六次至八次，經數大至一週　治愈。　類似性霍亂症，水瀉數回後，成米泔樣下痢，嘔吐亦然，尿量减少，手足厥冷、蒼白、脫力、腓腸肌疼痛，如經適當醫治，二十四小時後，下痢即止，然有轉為眞性霍亂症可能。　眞性霍亂症，本菌潛伏期無定，約不出二天至五天，其瀉或無先兆，突然而來，頭痛、嘔吐、全身衰弱、體溫下降，日出冷汗，脈搏頻數細小，泌尿减少，或絕止，無痛性之米泔樣吐瀉，一天二十次至三十次，眼窩凹陷，皮膚冷厥，呈紫藍色，諸肌痙攣，呼吸困難，經數時至數日而死，亦有不下痢而經過者，此曰乾性霍亂症，總之，不論屬於何種，均應立即就臀為是。</p>
<p>諺曰：「一兩之預防，勝於一磅之治療一如以霍亂症而論，預防實　關　要，　患本症者，當急送傳染病院，室內嚴行消毒及滅菌法，以防傳佈，未患者，應速注射防疫針，在本症流行時，對於飲食尤宜特別注意，良以傳染本症之主要原因，實為飲用染有霍亂菌之水，或食物所致，故勿飲未沸之水，勿食未熱或潰爛之瓜果，以及蒼蠅接觸之食物，實為預防霍亂症必須遵守之原則，此外注重淸潔及排除污穢、死水、實行街道里弄家庭大掃除，講求營養衛生，每天早起　眠，飲食有節，以增加抵抗力，以及勿多慮煩悶，無事勿蒞公共塲所等，均為當務之急，至如患有洩瀉者，應即就醫，以免誘發本症。</p>
<h3>家事一得</h3>
<p>— 寅生</p>
<p>米：米缸（或箱）內放辣椒數枚，或螃蟹殼二三隻，可使米日久不蛀。</p>
<p>書：書櫥中藏芸香，（又名七里香）可辟　。</p>
<p>花瓶水：夏日人火燒瓦一片不臭，冬月入硫磺不凍。</p>
<p>梨：用梨蘿蔔隔開，勿使相着，用竹簍收藏，（忌木器）經年不壞。</p>
<p>衣箱：箱內放浮水之蘆甘石（藥舖有售）於四隅，可收濕氣，永不生蛀蟲。</p>
<p>貓犬生癩：以硫磺拌飯與食極效。</p>
<p>雞瘟：亦以生硫磺灌食極效。</p>
<p>預防霍亂：夏日菜餚最好以蔬食為主，若能多吃酸醋更佳，以免霍亂菌之傳染。（因霍亂菌是畏酸性的）惟已患霍亂症象者，官亟速延醫，切勿耽誤。</p>

<h3>怕羞了嗎？</h3>
<p>— 胡蓉</p>
<p>慧兒因為沒有新衣穿，不肯去參加表兄的婚禮。她說：「穿了舊衣服和親戚相見，怪難為情的」。爸爸說：「有什麽難為情？在有遠見的人的眼中，一件淸潔的舊衣比綢製的新衣容易得到同情和信仟；只要你有學問，有本領，衣服穿得舊些，並無關係。假使你沒有學問和本領，即使打扮得像仙女一樣，別人還是看不起你的。」</p>
<p>媽媽叫敏兒去泡水，敏兒不肯去，他說：一提了銅壼在街上走，多麼難看；假使被回學遇見，不怕被他們笑歪嘴嗎」？媽媽說：「孩子，你錯了，你去泡水，是幫家裏做事，別人一定說你勤勞，決不曾笑你，你記住，做工不是可羞的事，貪吃懶做和不正當的事，才是眞正的可羞」！</p>
<p>小朋友！你曾經為了不必要的羞恥而不願赴宴嗎？不願做事嗎？假使有過，請記住上面爸爸和媽媽的話。</p>

<h3>保健運動法（四）</h3>
<p>麥氏保健法，全套二十七種，分為三組，第一組練習方式，已於上期登完，本期起當連續刊登第二及第三兩組，即十至十　及二十至二十七式，請讀者注意。</p>
<p>保健運動二十七種，簡單與複雜兼而有之，練習時雖有難易之分，但其促進健康，增加抗力之功能則一，况不受時地限制，不必借重器械，家庭之中，人人實行，對於家庭健康幸福之增進，實有極大幫助。</p>
<p>本期所刊第十二圖式，是比較複雜的一種，練習時，非集中心思，不能使動作一致，惟開始雖較困難，但熟能生巧，積而久之，自能得心應手，運轉自如。</p>
<p>保健原非「一蹴可幾」惟有抱定「鍥而不舍」的精神，依照方式，天天練習，對於看似簡單的幾種，旣不忽略過去，對於複雜的方式，也不畏難而止，這樣一定可以逹到確保健康的目的。</p>
<p>（圖十及十一）</p>
<p>身體平臥，兩手貼腰際，兩腿分開，舉左腿及右臂，用腿轉一圓圈，轉時應如圖中箭頭轉至裏邊，勿觸地，同時右臂轉一圓圈，由裏面轉至外邊，複做六次，紀為一次。</p>
<p>第十一練習方式，與上述動作完全相同，但應舉右腿及左臂，亦複做六次。</p>
<p>按以上兩種方式，使肩胸腿臂各部，均得有充分運動，而用腿臂轉圈，則使肌筋中。或其主要部份，獲有新的活動機會，裨益尤非淺鮮。</p>
<p>（圖十二）</p>
<p>身體平臥，兩腿上舉成直角，兩臂向上伸直，靠近兩腿，同時轉雙圓圈，左腿及左臂向左轉，右臂及右腿向右轉，轉時由外而裏，兩手及足勿觸地，複做六次，記數以圓圈為一次</p>

<h3>一星期家常菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>茄子上市還不滿一月，現的不算怎樣貴了。茄子有本地產與甯波產兩種，以人體來作經，產於本地的是矮胖子，產於寗波的是瘦長條子，倒也像美國滑稽影片中勞來哈台一樣，甚是好頑，葷的做法，可將子挖去，塞以肉末，加以邊尖香菌等輔佐品，一同紅燒，還有用雞油來也一同白燒的，四川菜中就有這種做法，吃客視為美肴。還有用麵粉雞蛋等麵拖茄子的，可　茄子洗凈去皮，切成梭子塊，將雞蛋麵粉打和做成糊槳，將茄子在內拖過，然後油煎，稍見焦黃便可取食，蘸以辣醬油，大可佐酒。素的做法，最好用甜醬同燒，至酥爛　度，簡便一些，那麼只須在飯鍋上蒸酥，用醬麻油或麻醬拌來吃好了。</p>
<p>星期一　茄子塞肉末　糖醋鹹帶魚　紅燒捲心菜　香椿拌豆腐</p>
<p>星期二　洋葱牛肉絲　蝦米蛋花湯　百葉炒靑菜　雪菜　豆芽</p>

<h3>British-Indian Relations Gradually Reaching a Stalemate</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 18th, Domei News Agency - According to news from London, well-informed sources in London recently stated that the British government is paying no attention to the Indian Congress Party's request for renegotiation. This statement indicates that the only avenue for compromise left by the Walter Hall resolution has been closed. The stalemate between India and Britain is brewing. The British government is now carefully watching the development of the anti-British movement in India. If this movement threatens the British line of defense in India, the British government will not hesitate to take decisive action.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 18th, Haitong News Agency - A Swedish newspaper correspondent in England reported that British government officials stated that if any movement launched by the All-India Congress is enough to endanger the defense of India, Britain will immediately take decisive measures. It is absolutely impossible for the British government to change its attitude towards the Indian seat or make concessions to the Indian Congress Party at this time. Sir Cripps's words are the final words of Britain. The British government will never allow changes to India's constitutional status during the war. The British government is confident that its position will be supported by Parliament.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 17th, Domei News Agency - According to a dispatch from New Delhi, Nationalist leader Nehru expressed strong opinions when he met with reporters today. He said that Britain should immediately return political power to the Indians. The Executive Committee of the Congress Party is not concerned about Britain's actions after the war, but about how they will act today.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 18th, Havas News Agency - The committee passed a resolution stating that India should be governed by Indians. Because after the United States joined the war, its responsibility to the world's democratic nations has increased, India hopes that the United States can influence British policy.</p>
<h3>Washington Watching the French Fleet Issue - Hai Henri Visits Welles</h3>
<p>Washington, 17th, Havas News Agency - When Secretary of State Hull received reporters today, a reporter asked that if the French fleet anchored in Alexandria were to be sabotaged one day, the opinions of France and the United States differ on who should be responsible. How should this matter be resolved? Secretary of State Hull immediately replied that he would wait to receive information before expressing an opinion. Political figures here believe that Hull's reserved attitude is intended to ease the tone of American newspapers, because some newspapers have made fierce criticisms of the current relationship between France and the United States. The French fleet issue is being closely watched here. Today, French Ambassador to the United States Hai Henri met with Under Secretary of State Welles to discuss the matter. It is expected that consultations will continue within days.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Switzerland, 17th, Havas News Agency - The Lausanne Tribune commented on the current relations between the United States and France, saying, "Regarding the disposition of the Alexandria fleet, Chief Laval has adopted a very tough stance. If the French fleet accepts Admiral Howard's order to sail to the ports selected by Britain and the United States, it would directly contradict the provisions of the Franco-German armistice agreement. France can only accept two solutions: one is that the French fleet will remain in Alexandria regardless of what happens in the future, and the other is to return to France. Chief Laval's stance is entirely based on the obligations France assumed when signing the armistice agreement, so his stance is firm and immovable. We hope that this matter will be resolved smoothly without sinking the French fleet."</p>
<p>French Ambassador's Secretary Arrested in the United States</p>
<p>Lisbon, 18th, Haitong News Agency - According to news from Washington, Mossaz, the secretary of French Ambassador to the United States Hai Henri, has been arrested. Hai Henri expressed "extreme regret." He said that Mossaz was not a secret agent of Vichy.</p>

British reconnaissance units reported that German forces were active in the southern zone, and General Rommel had deployed defenses slightly behind the front line in preparation for a southerly offensive. Although the battle situation was not as fierce as on Thursday, reports from all sides said that the war was far from over and would become more intense. At the same time, the Cairo Gazette stated that yesterday British troops in the northern zone advanced southwards, but as a result of the Axis counterattack, the British troops had abandoned the occupied territory.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Switzerland, 18th, Domei News Agency - The tank units of the two armies in the middle of Alamein, Egypt, launched a tug-of-war battle on Tuesday morning, which became more and more fierce. It only stopped in the darkness of the night. It is unknown who won or lost. There were no reports as to whether they contacted again yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 18th, Haitong News Agency - According to the London Times, there is a battle for important positions south of Alamein, and a large number of tanks are participating. The battle situation is unpredictable. The loss of a large number of tanks may change the battle situation, but the battle has reached a decisive stage.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 18th, Haitong News Agency - The "Evening News" correspondent in London reported that the British Air Force in North Africa is now trying to detect the location of Marshal Rommel's headquarters. The British side frankly admitted that the main purpose of the British aircraft's repeated air raids was here. London even claimed that several cars belonging to Rommel's headquarters were hit by bombs, but it was impossible to find out whether the German commander was sitting in any of them. The British people's emotions about the situation in Egypt are becoming increasingly tense. London believes that the tank battle now underway is very important.</p>

<h3>German Special War Report Announces: Capture of Voroshilovgrad</h3>
<p>German Supreme Headquarters, 18th, Hai Tong News Agency - The German Military Headquarters issued the following special war report last night, stating that Voroshilovgrad, an important industrial town in the Donets region, has now been captured by the German army after several days of fierce fighting. Many areas are on fire.</p>
<p>German Supreme Headquarters, 18th, Haitong News Agency - This afternoon's German war report, our troops and mechanized units continue to advance southward, have reached the lower reaches of the Don River, annihilated the surrounded enemy troops, and occupied more territory. The German Air Force bombed the enemy and was very active in the lower reaches of the Don River. The retreating Soviet troops south of the Don River were particularly threatened by German aircraft. Luoji and other important areas in the industrial area of the Don River basin were occupied by infantry on July 17. Most of the city was engulfed in flames, which proved the great losses suffered by the Soviet Union after several days of fierce fighting. The enemy troops who attacked the fortresses were repelled. The remaining enemy troops in the rear in the middle of the road are being cleared. South of Lake Ilmen, the elite enemy forces launched an unsuccessful attack. An enemy team once entered our army's position, and our army quickly counterattacked and repelled the enemy.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Switzerland, 18th, Domei News Agency - The Red Army in the Don River bend continues to retreat. Voroshilovgrad, an important industrial area located 100 miles north of Rostov, was also captured by the German army after several days of fierce fighting. Several places in the city are on fire. At the same time, Stalingrad, a city in the lower reaches of the Volga River, is also becoming increasingly dangerous. The Red Army has concentrated all its heavy artillery and tanks to defend this important industrial area. The Red Army authorities have also strictly ordered soldiers to defend the city to prevent the German army from crossing the Volga-Don Canal. Rostov is the gateway to the Caucasus, and it is also becoming tight. There are 15 divisions of German troops attacking in that direction. Fierce fighting is still going on in the area of Voronezh in the upper reaches of the Don River.</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th, Haitong News Agency - Voroshilovgrad, which was broken into by the German army yesterday, is located in the northern end of the Donets coal mining area. The city's industrial progress has been very rapid. In 1933, the city had only 100,000 people. By 1936, it had increased to 213,000. Later, the Soviet Union set up important military equipment industries in the area and expanded the existing coal mining industry, so people continued to increase. The city is the capital of the Voroshilovgrad region of Ukraine. The area covers an area of 36,500 square kilometers and has a population of 1.3 million. There are many iron smelters, locomotive factories, engineering factories, and military equipment factories in the city. The city is located 15 kilometers southwest of the Don River, with multiple railway lines passing through it, and a direct railway to Rostov in the south, so the city is very important in terms of transportation.</p>
<p>Chicago, 18th, Domei News Agency - According to news from Moscow, the situation in the central region of the Soviet-German front suddenly became obviously tense again, because there were signs that the German army was planning to launch a large-scale offensive in the Belinsky area. At the same time, it was heard that the German army set out from Kalinin, Erzhev, Vyazma, and Orel and exerted great pressure on the Soviet defense lines around Moscow.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 18th, Havas News Agency - According to yesterday's news from the Eastern Front, the German army has advanced to a certain place 30 miles west of Rostov. Today, it is heard that the east side of the city is also threatened. The defending troops now have to deal with attacks from both sides. It is expected that the battle of Rostov will be similar to the battle of Voronezh.</p>
<p>German Offensive Near Voronezh Encountered Obstacles</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 17th, Havas News Agency - The recent development of the battle situation on the Eastern Front shows that the German offensive in Voronezh has been frustrated, but the German offensive near the Don River bend is becoming increasingly fierce. Currently, fighting is still going on near the city of Voronezh. The Red Army bulletin stated that the German army launched many local offensives in the area, but they were all repelled. Neutral observers here believe that the German authorities are now replenishing troops and mobilizing new forces in order to launch a decisive battle. The Soviet Air Force is extremely active in the area, bombing German pontoon bridges and barracks without leaving any effort. As for the battles in other areas, Berlin has been taciturn for several days. Only the Red Army General Headquarters issued a war report stating, "Bloody battles occurred northeast of Millerovo. Our army was outnumbered and is retreating to new positions and curbing the enemy's advance on various transportation lines." Also, news from the Soviet official indicated that a large tank battle is currently taking place in the Astakhov area east of Millerovo. The earth-shattering nature of this battle is more than the famous tank battle in the Kharkov area in May. In addition, the Red Army counterattacked on the left bank of the Don River and has reached the city of Migolinskaya, which was captured by the German army three days ago. The Red Army's resistance between Millerovo and Astakhov is fierce, and the German army's eastward advance has been frustrated. It has no choice but to concentrate all its forces southward. The German army is now advancing parallel to the Voronezh-Rostov railway line, with the obvious purpose of reaching the junction of the Don River and the Donets River in order to encircle the Red Army in the Rostov area in one fell swoop. It is heard that the German army has established a pocket-shaped position 30 miles east of Millerovo. According to other news from the Soviet Union, it is learned that Moscow hopes that the battle situation can be stabilized within a few days, but Soviet official and semi-official spokespersons frankly admit that the Red Army's position is still very critical. If Stalingrad falls, the Red Army's morale and strategy will be greatly affected. In the middle section of the front, no major battles have occurred, but the German army is preparing to attack in the areas of Kalinin and Bryansk. As far as the former area is concerned, the Red Army claims to have repeatedly repelled the enemy's offensive, and even consolidated positions in certain places in order to cope with the enemy's general offensive. As far as the latter area is concerned, fierce local battles have also occurred. The German army is concentrating a large army and tank units there.</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th, Haitong News Agency - Military sources here last night denied the Soviet claim of progress in the Voronezh area on the southern route of the Eastern Front, stating that Voronezh has been behind the German battle line for many days. The Soviet troops in the city have completely withdrawn, and a large German army is passing through the city and heading east.</p>
<h3>Soviet Troops Adopt Two-Sided Attacks</h3>
<p>Moscow, 18th, Domei News Agency - Millions of German troops are flowing through the countryside, approaching the Caucasus. Soviet troops retreated to the lower reaches of the Don River last night. The German troops advancing towards Rostov and the Caucasus have expanded their area of advance and made a wedge-shaped penetration south from Millerovo. As a result, Kamensk, a railway city in the Don River basin 40 miles away, is closer. Now Stalingrad, an industrial city in the Volga River bend, and Rostov are both under serious threat, and the Soviet troops based in the western corner of the Caucasus are in serious danger of being surrounded by the German troops southeast of Millerovo. After cutting off the important railway traffic between Moscow and Rostov, the German army continued to advance, and is now trying to bypass the north of the Don River basin and attack Rostov from the north, while at the same time rushing to Stalingrad to cut off the entire Caucasus connection. North of Kamensk, there is the Donets River as cover. It is heard that the Red Army has attacked the two sides of the German troops who recently made a wedge-shaped penetration in order to hinder the German army's advance.</p>
<h3>Soviet Aircraft Fly to the Gulf of Finland and Bomb German Warships</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Switzerland, 18th, Havas News Agency - According to news from Moscow, Germany has concentrated a large number of warships and transport ships in the Gulf of Finland. For three days, Soviet aircraft have been bombing them fiercely, and several ships have been sunk and damaged.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Urgent Need for Emergency Action - Urge Opening of Second Battlefield</h3>
<p>Washington, 17th, Havas News Agency - After the German army penetrated deeper and deeper on the Eastern Front, the Soviet Union's diplomatic pressure to request the Allied countries to open a second battlefield increased. The Soviet Union fully acknowledges that dispersing the enemy's forces should be considered purely from a military point of view, but insists that emergency action is needed under the current situation. Soviet newspapers often carry the words of government officials, arguing that a large-scale Allied offensive in Western Europe can at least force the German army to withdraw half of its strength from the Eastern Front in order to cope with this new attack. Both Soviet and British officials acknowledge that opening a second battlefield is extremely dangerous and will affect most countries, but the Soviet side still maintains that no matter how dangerous this matter is, it must be realized.</p>
<p>London, 17th, Havas News Agency - The British Communist Party issued a declaration demanding that the government immediately open a second battlefield.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 18th, Haitong News Agency - According to the Washington Post, before Britain and the United States open a second front, they must first prevent the threat of submarines. According to the Tribune, the Allied countries' opening of a second front depends on the Soviet Union's possession of reserves. When the Allied countries launch an offensive, the British and American troops need the cooperation of the Soviet reserves.</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th, Haitong News Agency - According to the German Foreign Ministry's mouthpiece, the "German Foreign Policy Communication," Britain and the United States' call to open a second front and launch a war in Western Europe violates international law. Article 43 of the Hague Land Warfare Convention stipulates that the occupying country shall be responsible for maintaining order in the occupied area and take strict measures to prevent various difficulties.</p>
<h3>Finnish Consulate in the US Temporarily Closed</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Alliance News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Washington, the US State Department recently announced that the Finnish Consulate in the US will be temporarily closed until August 1st.</p>
<p>Helsinki, Finland, 17th (Havas News Agency) - The local authorities recently issued a public statement saying that the Finnish government was astonished to hear of the US decision to sever consular relations with Finland. The Finnish government does not believe that the attitude of its diplomatic or consular personnel in the US would warrant such action. In the future, Finland's interests in the US will be handled directly by the Embassy in Washington. It is reported that Finland has a Consulate General in New York, and a total of sixteen consulates throughout the US. Furthermore, local political figures do not overemphasize the US decision to sever consular relations with Finland, as no new incidents have occurred between the US and Finland in recent months that would cause relations to deteriorate. Another dispatch from Washington states that the US State Department has notified the Finnish Minister to the US, Mr. [勃洛髙波], that he or his embassy staff must obtain special permits if they wish to travel throughout the United States in the future.</p>
<h3>Secret British Discussion on Shipping Situation</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 18th (Alliance News Agency) - According to reports from London, the British House of Commons debated the issue of the extreme shortage of British ships yesterday afternoon. Not only was it held in secret, but nothing was disclosed afterwards. It was only announced that "the House of Commons discussed the shipping situation and listened to the government's report." In addition, Sir Stafford Cripps also stated that the government would definitely not make any announcements, so this secret debate remains shrouded in mystery. It is heard that the only reason for keeping the debate secret is that the tonnage of ships lost and newly built would be helpful to the enemy.</p>

Except for eleven people who died because they were sent to the hospital late and could not be treated in time, the rest have gradually recovered and been discharged. Recently, the heat wave has not subsided, and the spread of cholera is even more rapid, especially in the Nanshi area. The concession area is densely populated, and the infection is a cause for concern. It is hoped that citizens throughout the city will pay special attention to diet and hygiene to avoid infection. If symptoms of cholera are found, send them to the hospital immediately to avoid delays and untreatable outcomes. It is noted that the hospital has a long history and remarkable achievements. The medical staff and the authorities in charge are all enthusiastic individuals who provide medical treatment and medicine, saving countless lives. They are busy day and night and manage the hospital perfectly. Due to the rising prices of medicine and the large expenses, the hospital is experiencing great financial difficulties. It is sincerely hoped that people from all walks of life will make generous donations so that the hospital's operations will not be interrupted, benefiting the poor and sick. Such contributions would be a deed of immense merit. Donations can be sent directly to the hospital, or call 7283-4 for collection.

This measure by the authorities is necessary to crack down on speculation, as some exchange houses are engaged in transactions of old legal tender between Shanghai and the interior. The relevant authorities are considering specific measures to implement this plan.</p>
<h3>Nanshi Old People's Home</h3>
<p>Old people, unless they are your own parents, asking us to patiently serve them for a week or a month, anyone would frown and consider it a thankless task. If you were asked to serve an unrelated old man or an old woman for three or five years, you might think it was a joke. However, there are actually people willing to do it now, without any remuneration, and they serve not just one old person, but dozens or hundreds, and they do it for life, often begging from door to door for these old people. In our history, apart from [武訓], a beggar who built schools, we have not seen a second example. But now there is such a miracle, and this miracle is not far away, right before our eyes.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Nanshi Old People's Home, everyone is somewhat familiar with it, vaguely thinking it's just an institution that takes in poor, helpless old people. But the reality is not that simple. In a so-called charity organization, the person in charge signs in on time and carefully supervises, which is already considered fulfilling their responsibilities. Demanding that they do everything "personally" is just an empty phrase. However, the nuns in the Nanshi Old People's Home, commonly known as "Little Sisters of the Poor" or "Mums," wholeheartedly and joyfully do just that without exception. They serve meals for all 350 male and female elderly residents, help them get up and go to bed, care for them day and night when they are sick, wash their clothes, cook their meals, and even help those who are too weak to bathe and change clothes. When they die, they accompany, comfort, and watch over them until their last breath. In reality, even in families with filial sons and obedient grandchildren, they may not be able to provide these poor old people with such blessings in their old age!</p>
<p>There are fourteen Chinese nuns and twenty foreign nuns in the Old People's Home, all of whom have vowed chastity and to serve the elderly for life. According to regulations, they are not allowed to own land or property to generate income, so their annual operating expenses and supplies all depend on their daily begging. Regardless of cold or heat, rain or wind, they have done this day in and day out for decades. This simple yet great spirit of sacrifice is truly worthy of admiration and praise in today's society.</p>
<p>But what they expect from society is definitely not admiration and praise, but a great deal of sympathy and assistance. Currently, the economy is sluggish, prices are soaring, and the home needs 75 shi of rice per month and 15,000 yuan for all expenses. However, the original wealthy donors have recently felt stretched and unable to help. They are not worried about themselves, but worried about the old people who depend on them for their lives. "Even the cleverest housewife cannot cook without rice," and they don't know how they will manage in the future. However, they have a firm faith, they believe that in human civilized society, there are still some benevolent men and women with chivalrous hearts who will not bear to see their work unable to continue.

<h3>American Express Bank to Make Fourth Payment Tomorrow; Chase Manhattan to Make Third Withdrawal; HSBC and Overseas Chinese Bank Fearful, Show No Intention; Central and Farmers Banks to Allow Withdrawals of Up to 1,000 Yuan per Person</h3>
<p>As Citibank handles withdrawal matters, American Express Bank in the Sassoon House at No. 20 The Bund also announced yesterday that it would begin its fourth payment starting on Monday. This fourth payment will be 40% of the original deposit minus the previously withdrawn 2,000 yuan. Nationals of Britain, the United States, and other countries can still enjoy the right to withdraw 500 yuan per week according to the previously determined plan. At the same time, it is rumored that other banks such as the Overseas Chinese Bank and HSBC will soon begin another round of withdrawals, as it is said that the deposits in these banks are sufficient to handle this task. However, the date has not yet been determined. Citibank's fourth withdrawal amount is half of the deposit after deducting the previous three withdrawals. In other words, depositors can withdraw 50% of the amount frozen in Citibank. As for the Central Bank and the Farmers Bank of China, they are continuing to handle the first payment, with depositors being able to withdraw up to 1,000 yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes. The withdrawal locations are the Jing'an Temple Road branch of the Central Bank and the Avenue Foch branch of the Farmers Bank, with withdrawals being handled from 10:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. daily. Chase Manhattan Bank's third withdrawal, approved from Monday of next week (July 20th), will allow each person to withdraw 10% of their deposit.</p>

<h3>Public Bonds Nearly Stagnant – New Developments</h3>
<p>The over-the-counter market for public bonds yesterday showed a weak, range-bound trading pattern. The trading range narrowed, and it seemed difficult to break the stagnant situation in the short term. Since the talk of unified control arose, investors have hesitated. While trading wasn't entirely quiet, it was hard to generate any excitement. A few firms accounted for most of the trading, which mainly consisted of bulls exiting positions and shorts covering. With no new developments, it's unclear how long this stagnation will last. The final market prices were mixed, with more declines than advances, and the changes were only a few cents. Trading volume remained around one million yuan. A summary table is provided below:</p>

<h3>Assisting the Public Works Department in Cholera Prevention</h3>
<p>— Huá</p>
<p>Recently, several cases of true cholera have been discovered in the city. Therefore, the Public Works Department, to ensure the safety of all citizens, is further implementing prevention measures. To protect our own health and the health of our families, we should naturally cooperate closely with the authorities.</p>
<p>The cholera bacteria was discovered in 1883 by Dr. Koch. These bacteria often thrive in water. Patients suffer from vomiting and diarrhea, and the patient's surroundings and feces are all carriers of cholera. Therefore, we should immediately pay attention to the following points:</p>
<p>1.  The lid of the garbage can should be closed tightly to prevent flies from entering, as flies are carriers of the bacteria.</p>
<p>2.  All vegetables and other foods must be washed thoroughly and boiled before consumption.</p>
<p>3.  All drinking water must be boiled. Do not drink raw water.</p>
<p>4.  In the event of a cholera patient, everything near them should be disinfected immediately.</p>
<p>5.  Preserved dishes must be covered with gauze.</p>
<p>6.  Voluntarily get vaccinated at a vaccination site.</p>
<h3>Three Attitudes for Raising Children</h3>
<p>— Jìng</p>
<p>The most important thing in raising children is the attitude taken by the parents, and the following three are especially important.</p>
<p>1.  A Humble Attitude: This does not mean that parents should have no confidence in themselves at all, but rather that they should not take a definitive attitude. It has always been assumed that parents' opinions are never wrong, but this is not the case. We should be brave enough to admit mistakes, even in front of our children. For example, if your eldest son says to you, "You never let me do this or that, why can my younger brother do as he pleases?" You can say, "Son, we are bound to make mistakes, especially when you were young, because you were our first child." In this way, the feelings between parents and children will quickly increase, and the children will never lose their respect for their parents.</p>
<p>2.  A Cultivating Attitude: Many parents have no cultivation at all. When they encounter disappointments, they handle things very heavily, or slam the door shut, or stomp their feet in the house, or kick cats and dogs out the door, or even scold and beat their children for no reason. These things leave a very bad impression on the children.</p>
<p>In the family, rules are necessary, but everything should be dealt with in a calm attitude. If parents are always impatient, then the children will learn to imitate them.</p>
<p>3.  A Tolerant Attitude: Everyone is bound to make mistakes, especially children who lack life experience. Therefore, parents should observe their children's behavior from their perspective and gradually teach them the necessary knowledge. If high standards are set without starting from the lower levels, it will never be possible to cultivate good habits in the children.</p>
<p>But the tolerance mentioned here is to raise children calmly and give them some leeway, not to simply tolerate and let them run wild.</p>
<h3>Cholera Prevention</h3>
<p>— Yú Lìrén</p>
<p>The terrible true cholera has been repeatedly discovered in the city, and its lethality is imminent and spreading. No wonder everyone talks about it with terror and everyone is fearful. It is essential to pay close attention to how to recognize this disease and how to prevent it.</p>
<p>According to this disease's pathogen, it is a comma-shaped bacillus that is unique to this disease. The shape of the bacteria is mostly slightly curved, the size of a cochlea is short and thick, and multiple bacteria are connected in a spiral or S shape. It can live in food for seven or eight days, and in fly intestines for at least three days. It dies quickly when exposed to dryness and acids. The important vehicles of transmission of this disease are summarized below.</p>
<p>The excrement of cholera patients is thrown into water or on riverbanks, wellsides, and washing of patients' clothes and tableware, etc., causing the water to be often mixed with cholera bacteria. Once ingested, it is extremely easy to be infected. It is also extremely easy to transmit during the summer and autumn months when there are many flies.</p>
<p>This disease can be roughly divided into three types: Simple cholera diarrhea, six to eight times a day, cured in several days to a week. Similar cholera symptoms, watery diarrhea several times, then turns into rice water-like diarrhea, vomiting as well, reduced urine output, cold and pale hands and feet, fatigue, calf muscle pain, if treated properly, diarrhea will stop after 24 hours, but there is a possibility of turning into true cholera. True cholera, the incubation period of the bacteria is uncertain, about two to five days, the diarrhea may be sudden without warning, headache, vomiting, general weakness, decreased body temperature, cold sweats, rapid and weak pulse, decreased or complete cessation of urination, painless rice water-like vomiting and diarrhea, twenty to thirty times a day, sunken eye sockets, cold and clammy skin, purplish-blue, muscle spasms, difficulty breathing, death in a few hours to a few days, there are also those who pass through without diarrhea, this is called dry cholera. In short, no matter which type, you should seek medical attention immediately.</p>
<p>As the saying goes: "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure." As far as cholera is concerned, prevention is essential. Those suffering from this disease should be sent to infectious disease hospitals immediately, and strict disinfection and sterilization methods should be carried out indoors to prevent spread. Those who have not been infected should be vaccinated as soon as possible. Special attention should be paid to diet during the prevalence of this disease. The main cause of infection with this disease is drinking water or food contaminated with cholera bacteria, so do not drink unboiled water, do not eat uncooked or rotten melons and fruits, and food touched by flies. These are essential principles to be followed in preventing cholera. In addition, pay attention to cleanliness and eliminate dirt and stagnant water, carry out street, alley, and household cleaning, pay attention to nutrition and hygiene, get up early and go to bed early every day, eat in moderation to increase resistance, do not worry or be depressed, and do not go to public places if you have nothing to do. All these are urgent matters. As for those suffering from diarrhea, they should seek medical attention immediately to avoid triggering this disease.</p>
<h3>One Thing Learned in Housework</h3>
<p>— Yín Shēng</p>
<p>Rice: Place several chilies or two or three crab shells in the rice jar (or box) to keep the rice from being infested for a long time.</p>
<p>Books: Hide rue (also known as seven-mile fragrance) in the bookcase to ward off insects.</p>
<p>Vase Water: In summer, putting a piece of tile burned by fire in the water will prevent it from smelling; in winter, putting sulfur in it will prevent it from freezing.</p>
<p>Pears: Separate pears from radishes and do not let them touch. Store them in bamboo baskets (avoid wooden utensils) to keep them from spoiling for a year.</p>
<p>Clothes Trunk: Place floating alum stone (available at pharmacies) in the four corners of the trunk to absorb moisture and prevent moths forever.</p>
<p>Dog and cat mange: Mix sulfur with rice and feed it to them for extreme effect.</p>
<p>Chicken plague: Also, feed raw sulfur down their throats for extreme effect.</p>
<p>Cholera Prevention: In summer, dishes should preferably be vegetarian. It is even better to eat more sour vinegar to prevent the spread of cholera bacteria (because cholera bacteria are afraid of acidity). However, those who already have symptoms of cholera should quickly seek medical attention and not delay.</p>

<h3>Are You Shy?</h3>
<p>— Hú Róng</p>
<p>Huì'ér refused to attend her cousin's wedding because she had no new clothes to wear. She said, "It's so embarrassing to meet relatives in old clothes." Her father said, "What's embarrassing about that? In the eyes of far-sighted people, a clean old piece of clothing is easier to get sympathy and trust than a new silk dress. As long as you have knowledge and ability, it doesn't matter if your clothes are a bit old. If you have no knowledge or ability, even if you dress up like a fairy, others will still look down on you."</p>
<p>Mom asked Mǐn'ér to fetch water, but Mǐn'ér refused to go. He said, "It's so ugly to walk on the street with a copper kettle. If I run into my classmates, wouldn't they laugh their heads off?" Mom said, "Child, you're wrong. You're fetching water to help the family, and others will definitely say you're diligent. They'll never laugh at you. Remember, working is not a shameful thing. Gluttony, laziness, and wrongdoing are truly shameful!"</p>
<p>Little friends! Have you ever refused to attend a banquet or do something because of unnecessary shame? If you have, please remember the words of the father and mother above.</p>

<h3>Health Exercise Method (4)</h3>
<p>The Mài's health exercise method has a total of twenty-seven exercises, divided into three groups. The first group of exercises has been published in the previous issue. Starting with this issue, the second and third groups, namely the tenth to nineteenth and twentieth to twenty-seventh exercises, will be published continuously. Please pay attention.</p>
<p>The twenty-seven health exercises are a combination of simple and complex. Although there is a difference in difficulty during practice, their function of promoting health and increasing resistance is the same. Moreover, it is not restricted by time and place, and there is no need to rely on equipment. Everyone in the family can practice it, which is of great help to improving family health and happiness.</p>
<p>The twelfth diagram published in this issue is a more complex one. During practice, you must concentrate your thoughts to make the movements consistent. Although it is more difficult to start, practice makes perfect. Over time, you will be able to master it and operate it freely.</p>
<p>Health care is not something that can be achieved overnight. Only by holding on to the spirit of "never giving up", practicing every day according to the method, and not neglecting the seemingly simple ones, and not stopping because of the difficult methods, can you definitely achieve the goal of ensuring health.</p>
<p>(Diagram 10 and 11)</p>
<p>Lie flat on your back, with your hands close to your waist and your legs apart. Raise your left leg and right arm, and rotate your leg in a circle. When rotating, you should rotate to the inside as shown in the arrow in the picture, without touching the ground. At the same time, rotate your right arm in a circle, from the inside to the outside. Repeat six times to record as one time.</p>
<p>The eleventh exercise method is exactly the same as the above action, but you should raise your right leg and left arm, and also repeat six times.</p>
<p>According to the above two methods, all parts of the shoulders, chest, legs, and arms can get sufficient exercise, and using the legs and arms to rotate in a circle gives the muscles and tendons, or their main parts, new opportunities for activity, which is especially beneficial.</p>
<p>(Diagram 12)</p>
<p>Lie flat on your back, raise your legs up at right angles, stretch your arms straight up, close to your legs, and rotate both circles at the same time. The left leg and left arm rotate to the left, and the right arm and right leg rotate to the right. When rotating, from the outside to the inside, do not touch the ground with your hands and feet. Repeat six times, counting a circle as one time.</p>

<h3>Replies to Letters Concerning Health Exercises</h3>
<p>Since this publication published the Mài's health exercise method on the 28th of last month, it has received many letters from readers, raising many questions about practice time, place, etc. It can be seen that readers are eager for health needs. The various questions asked are answered as follows.</p>
<p>The effects of practicing in the morning or evening are the same.</p>
<p>There is no difference before or after meals, but of course, you need to rest for a considerable amount of time after meals.</p>
<p>It can be done on the bed or on the ground, but of course, a soft bed that has lost its elasticity is not suitable for practice. After finishing the exercise, if you feel tired, you can rest for a while, otherwise, there is no need.</p>
<p>(Above answers to Mr. Ní Yōngxuān)</p>
<p>For the second exercise, do it fifteen times first, rest briefly, then do it fifteen times, rest for a moment, and then do twenty-five times.</p>
<p>The third and fourth exercises are the same. The so-called do not touch the ground when returning to the original position means that you can only touch the ground after doing it six times.</p>
<p>Due to space and picture limitations, we can only publish it one after another, but within the possible scope, we will publish it as soon as possible. (Above answer to a reader)</p>
<h3>One-Week Regular Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Huá Yīng</p>
<p>Eggplant has only been on the market for less than a month, and it's not that expensive now. There are two types of eggplant, local and Níngbō. To make an analogy to the human body, the one produced locally is short and fat, and the one produced in Níngbō is thin and long, which is like Laurel and Hardy in American comedy films. The savory method is to dig out the seeds, stuff them with minced meat, and add side-tip mushrooms and other auxiliary products, and braise them together. There are also those who use chicken oil to braise them together. There is this kind of practice in Sichuan cuisine, and diners regard it as a delicacy. There are also those who drag eggplants with flour, eggs, etc. You can wash the eggplants, peel them, cut them into shuttle-shaped pieces, mix the eggs and flour to make a paste, drag the eggplants in it, then fry them in oil, and you can eat them when they are slightly yellow and crispy. Dip it in spicy soy sauce and you can drink with it. For vegetarian dishes, it is best to braise with sweet sauce until soft and rotten. For something simpler, just steam them until soft on the rice pot and eat them mixed with sauce sesame oil or sesame sauce.</p>
<p>Monday: Eggplant Stuffed with Minced Meat, Sweet and Sour Salted Hairtail, Braised Cabbage, Tofu with Toon</p>
<p>Tuesday: Onion Beef Shreds, Dried Shrimp Egg Flower Soup, Baiye Fried Green Vegetables, Preserved Vegetables, Bean Sprouts</p>
<p>Wednesday: Chinese Chive Sprouts Fried with Shredded Pork, Pan-Fried Pomfret, Stir-Fried Ong Choy, Stir-Fried Long Cowpeas</p>
<p>Thursday: Tomato Beef Soup, Salted Pork Braised Tofu, Braised Winter Melon Slices, Scallion Broad Bean Paste Sand</p>
<p>Friday: Green Vegetable Rotten Meat Balls, Scallion Braised Small Crucian Carp, Vegetarian Oil Tofu Soup, Dried Tofu Stir-Fried Luffa</p>
<p>Saturday: Lettuce Mixed with Shredded Chicken, Flat Moss Fried with Eel Paste, Sweet Sauce Fried Eggplant, Dried Shreds Fried with Green Pepper</p>
<p>Sunday: Meat Fried Sauce, Fried Pomfret, Vegetarian Ten Views, Stir-Fried Lima Beans</p>

<h3>(197) Potato Flour Cake</h3>
<p>— Shēn Jiànxiá</p>
<p>Preparation: Rice Flour, Potatoes, Dried Shrimp, Salt, Monosodium Glutamate, Wine</p>
<p>Method: Peel and cook the potatoes, mash them into a puree, then mix them with an equal amount of rice flour and water to make a thick paste, and mix in the mashed potatoes. Then soak the dried shrimp in wine for a while, chop them finely with scallions, add an appropriate amount of salt and MSG, and mix them into the rice flour and potato paste. Then make small pieces of cake and put them in oiled oil and fry them repeatedly until they are all golden brown. Take them for meals, and you will feel that they are loose, beautiful and delicious. The broken rice distributed in the recent rationing of food can be washed clean and ground into flour, but pure flour cakes are not easy to digest. If the rations are not enough to eat, you can mix in potato puree. It is delicious and cheap and rich in nourishing ingredients. Please try it!</p>
<h3>(198) Cassia Potato Red Bean Paste Paste</h3>
<p>— Jiànxiá</p>
<p>Preparation: Potatoes, Cassia, Lard, Red Bean Paste, Sugar MSG</p>
<p>Method: First cook the potatoes, peel them, and mash them into a puree, then cut the lard into small pieces, and mix them with an appropriate amount of red bean paste, sugar, cassia, and MSG into the potato puree and mix them well, then put them in a boiling oil pot and stir-fry them briefly. This kind of food is enough to relieve the shortage of rations. It is made purely from miscellaneous grains and can be used as a meal substitute, which is acceptable. And the cost is cheaper than rice and noodles. You can try it. The flavor is extremely beautiful.</p>
<p>Introduction: "MSG", "Flavor Master", "Tianchu Soy Sauce Essence", and "Tianchu Household Water Chestnut Flour" produced by Tianchu MSG Factory are sold in major companies and South-North Goods food stores in the city.</p>
