<h3>美州長議員昨選舉　不致有意外結果　預料民主黨仍可佔多數</h3>
<p>華盛頓二日哈瓦斯社電　依照美國憲法規定、衆議院全體議員及參議員三分之一、每二年改選一次、本年適爲改選之年、已定於本月之第一個星期二舉行投票、任期屆滿之州長亦須同時改選、故是日全國人民均將忙於投票、據此間政治觀察家談稱、此次投票不致有驚人結果、預料共和黨在參議兩院、均能獲得右干議席、但民主黨仍可佔有多數、此次選舉中、最惹人注意之事、厥爲紐約州長之改選該州檢察官杜威、爲共和黨候選人、而裴納特則爲民主黨候選人、查羅斯福總統最初支持參議員梅特爲候選人、後遭亞爾巴尼與紐約兩州民主黨支部之反對、愛乃決定贊助裴納特、按梅特參錢員平時擁護新政、不遺餘力、而裴納特則爲民主黨中之保守份子、民意測騐院最近舉行民意測騐、其結果百分之五十三贊成共和黨候選人杜威、百分之三十九贊成民主黨候選人裴納特其餘百分之八、則贊成美國工黨候選人亞爾芳格、杜威明日倘能當選則一九四四年總統大選時共和黨將有極大希望、政府要人及民主黨員、又以爲杜戚對於戰後復興計劃所抱見解、與羅斯福總統之見解、完全不符、故對於杜威獲選一層、認爲非常危險、民主黨方面業已表示意見、以爲杜戚倘於現行戰爭結束之後、當選爲美國總統、「則一九一九年之錯誤、又將重演、」是故共和黨在下屆總統大選中、倘能獲勝、則其候選人、當以威雨基最爲適宜、至少在外交政策方面、其見解與羅斯福總統完全一致云、</p>

<h3>風雲變幻中之非洲　埃及—大戰重心的第二門戶（三）</h3>
<p>英人明知道保衛的計劃，並不專在拱守局部，能够多推出幾層外圍，比較拱守局部更爲安全。今歲春問不是在里比亞節節推進嗎？後來第八軍鎭守不住，終於在六月間把亞力、山大都鉗碎了，辛辛苦苦打出來的外圍，一層層被人破去，這時　當然要設法整頓人馬。</p>
<p>據我們統觀全局，德軍左螯旣已準備渡冬，現在的文章，定然是要把全力部傾注在右螯上。而英人方面，旣要保衛埃及，同時還要把地中海的實力充實起來；如若得手的話，還想巡一步建立第二戰塲，或是希臘，或是義大利，都有可能。這麼看來，雙方的使命都有萬鈞之軍，是毫無二疑義的了。現在要問雙方的準備，目下到了什麼程度。</p>
<p>這種軍事上的布置，局外人本來無從推測，可是從報紙的電訊上，一鱗半爪，搜集起來，也可糢糢糊糊有個大略。我們且先看一看斯末　將軍在倫教所說的兩句話：「過去四年，戰爭係取防守姿態，已吿結束；現則開始最後之進攻矣……」，又說「拚死之鬥爭已臨，吾人應當仁不讓……」。</p>
<p>這個口氣利害得很，「最後之進攻「拼死鬥爭」，這都不是單爲埃及目前的局部戰事而言；乃是一個龐大決戰的肇端。由此而觀，在準備上，必定相當充足。眼面前所知道在埃及的英軍只有十師，不過二十來萬人馬，較之去歲德蘇一千五百哩戰綫上的一二千萬人馬，數目上相差得太遠。</p>
<p>在德人夏季攻勞發動的時候，我們似乎聽得說過，英美蘇在近東高原上準備下了一個火藥袋袋，好像黃眉羅漢的乾坤袋一樣，這種袋袋陣需要的人馬，決不會只有幾十萬。從這一點看，也許所謂英軍十師的說法，僅僅是指着第一綫而言。</p>
<p>再看德義把兄弟二人的現况如何；據電訊上統計，現下由羅美爾將軍指揮的，有戰車二師，步兵二師，義軍七師；統統在內，約爲二十來萬人馬，可是羅美爾　軍回　與希氏晤談，中文章，不外乎添兵增將。所以現在已亦疆塲的兵卒，也僅是第一綫。</p>
<p>從攻守的形勢上看，德義方面，目下是以義人的里比亞爲根據　，前綫在阿拉眠附近，目標是亞歷山大·開羅·蘇彝士：而給養和援軍等等，都要從德義本土飛跨地中海而來，其中不免有些吃力，譬如中途的邀擊，和沿海岸綫常遭英海軍的襲擊，都要打些折扣</p>
<p>至於英美聯軍方面，除了從埃及可以就聽取得大部的給養外。軍火方面，在近東一帶，　備下的，大概也不少。同時在沿海一帶利用海軍，時常可以鬧鬧登陸的玩意兒。大的計劃方面，如西非南非布置得手，美國的供應可由達加爾或里比利亞直運埃及蘇丹再抵埃及前綫。所以從雙方局而上看來，這一次的北非戰事，將成爲很够熱鬧的一本戲。也許世界戰局，將在北非一帶打個定局，也未可知。</p>
<p>以上囉囉哆哆，抱泥帶水的說了不少廢話，可始終把前文提出的埃及門戶上的三把鑰匙，沒有交帶出來，抱歉得很</p>
<p>這三把鑰匙，其一是運輸錢的埃及蘇丹公路，其二是歐亞交通孔道的蘇彝士，其三是軍事重鎭的亞歷山大等等，前文指點出來過了，這　預備逐一提出看看，這幾把鑰匙，究竟是些什麼東西。</p>
<p>關於第一把鑰匙，牽扯的範圍很廣，如要詳細分析，勢必要從三皇五帝講起，例如埃及蘇丹的歷史·風土·人情·變革·山川土木，如何而有埃及與埃及蘇丹的劃分等等。這麼一來，又要弄得廢話連天，而且讀者只要把非洲地誌略一翻閱，比較淸楚得多了。</p>
<p>這裏只想把蘇丹公路的形成，略表一下，然又顧到下篇里比亞的重復叙述，所以只能略而又略的說幾　。</p>
<p>埃及蘇丹的局面自經英人經營以來本來極其複雜而微妙。自從央人允許埃及獨立，而維護着一段不了的姻緣，何以又不肯將蘇丹部分造成同樣的局面呢？第一，英人天性慳吝，不輕易痛痛快快的放棄在手的利權。第二，在蘇丹以南，整個的非洲東南半壁，除了葡屬摩贊俾克，和海上的法屬馬達加斯加之外，都是英屬的範圍，所以分出一部埃及來獨立，已是担了很重的心事，豈能又讓蘇丹脫手？</p>
<p>况且，一九三六年夏天，土耳其人在蒙特羅會議席上爭回了韃靼尼爾海峽的武裝，是由於英人幕後搗鬼的功勞。却未料到這一着棋引起了義大利出兵羅　斯島，同時義人爲了防息未然，又在里比亞增駐大軍，英人瞧着義人的種種行動，也就在埃及大整軍備，以爲對抗之計。殊不知這一來，把埃及的民衆騷擾得言三語四起來，英國紳士爲了要消弭埃人這種感情的衝動，所以毅然在一九三六年根據一九二二和一九三〇年的條件，成立協定，允許埃及正式獨立，並允許埃人無限制的移民到埃及蘇丹。</p>

<h3>蒐羅豐富的六大圖書館巡禮（三）</h3>
<p>中外各家圖書可稱全備　希望大眾養成讀書嗜好</p>
<p>查目須知</p>
<p>要找需要的書，可以查閱書目有的書目是書本式。的，有的書目是卡片式的。新亞的書目卡已隨着閱覽室　而鎖掉，僅藉圖書目錄來查考，所以增訂數次，新書並有加入。鴻英的圖書雜誌和明復的西文書雖有書目，但都因有卡片的輔助，所以年久失修，有許多書名是沒有列入的，所以查閱書目，當以卡片爲宜。卡片之中分分類卡·書名卡·作一者卡·三種，查閱時只須查其類屬，書名或作者某一項即可查到。但幾大圖書館的書目卡，往往不十分完備，工部局的中文書目卡和鴻英的雜誌種類卡，常有遺漏，震旦無著者卡。鴻英的叢書集成之部亦然。且其叢書集成中二書合訂者，以後數本卡片，每付缺如，非查原目不可，這些都是初來者所該注意的。查卡片的方法和查辭典一般，多按筆畫分類，這是很容易的，不過國文書名上有「增廣「最新」等字者須略去，英文書名的The亦然。</p>
<p>或翻目錄，或入書庫，便沒有這樣易尋，此處便非知道一些圖書館的門徑不可。圖書依着書碼排列，書碼則由分類碼書名著者三碼台成。現在普通採用的書碼根據杜威氏十進分類法，即以0至9十個字代表十類。即哲學·宗敎·社會·語文·自然·應用（包括農醫家事）·藝術·文學而殿以歷史，這九項知識的排列，大略有一點自然的順序，所以稍加注意是頗易記憶的。在此九項之外的，便都歸入0，放在1的前面，名爲總類·圖書·叢書之學便包括在這總類內。至於這十類中再分細目，一直分至小數爲止。只關於這些細目，巳成一册大書，其複雜可知。我們却只須略知大槪已便利不少了。</p>
<p>國文書的著者碼普通用王雲五四角號碼法，是照著者名字首字來排的。英文書的第二碼，第一字爲大寫字母即著者第一字，以下阿刺伯字爲根據其名字字母代出的數碼，最後一字母則爲書名首字，所以要查某人所著之書，即在該類中找某人名字第一字母的部分即可。</p>
<p>要查期刊刊載的文字中找需要的篇目，須有索引。鴻英圖書館旣以搜藏期刊著稱，它的業誌索引　很有用。不過以前所用的人文雜誌索引（該館前名「人文」出過人文雜誌）是分期刊載的，零零碎碎，頗不易查，最好查該館的卡片，卡片上所有的篇目，其雜誌即爲該館所藏者。此外其他外埠大圖書館所編的索引，普通的如嶺南的中文雜誌索引，北平的國學論文索引，專門的如農學論文，地學論文，昆轟論文，文學論文，心理論文，以至於淸人文獻，都有索引。他如科學敎育一雜誌有專門的索引，也有在索引中附記該交大意的，便叫提要（abstraet），關於史學論文從前大夏有過提要，其他似未見過，</p>
<p>借書手續</p>
<p>在目錄上查好書名，便可寫在借書單上，號碼要照樣抄下不可寫錯，否則便往往借不到。初去借書的人，往往不注意這些，所以很感麻煩。其實號碼的意義明白以後，寫起來便不易錯了。</p>
<p>每次借書大約可借兩三部，各館略有不同，有的地方有限定，有的地方沒有限定。</p>
<p>六圖書館中鴻英·海關·明復三處的書都不能借出館外，只司在館內閱覽。但明復圖書館本供中國科學社社員之用，對於捐款五百元以上的僩人或團體，贈送全年借書　張普通不能借出。震旦的書借出要　臨時保設金，中文書是十元，西文書是二十元，並限於單行本子，叢書不在內。新亞的書大部很，如果咨價高的，要看超出保證金的價目多少來決定。因爲加入先後的遲早，該館借書證的保證金自二元至五元，又改爲新幣五元，中間有許多等級，所以臨時保證金的數目也各各不同。工部局的書除參考書及叢書外。都可借出，因爲入館時已有學校或店舖負責擔保，所以就沒有別的保證金了。（待續）　（按本稿係李忙人君所撰，第一篇誤署「劍」宇，特爲勘正。</p>

<h3>持螯賞菊</h3>
<p>蟹是不幸的介族，它虛有其表，號稱「鐵甲將車」，却是一無腸公子」。披着一身盔甲，滿擬橫行江海。人類畢竟聰明，投其所好，搆搭蟹舍，挑燈誘捕，於是成羣結隊，自投陷阱·這幾天籬畔菊黃，蟹亦上市，不免瞎扯一轉，聊應時景。</p>
<p>蟹的產地，大別可分海洋·長江·內河·海水味鹹，所產的蟹，怪模怪樣，有的大如石皷，或則一對巨螯，形似魔掌，肉老味劣，非胃納奇佳者不屑問鼎。長江水活波淸，產蟹極多，味亦鮮美。不過上海人所貴，却在內河，這裏所說內河，其實指太湖流域一帶，即所謂「大閘蟹」者是。而洋澄湖所產，尤足珍奇，名氣之大，可與河南風陵渡黃河鯉；松江秀雅橋下四鰓鱸；富春江釣臺附近紅鱗鰣比擬。據說天地靈氣所鍾，獨具異徵，靑甲·白肚·金爪·黃毛·脂滿肉肥，鮮美無匹。更有故神其說的，背紋有深顯『王』字，爬行玻璃上，八足撑起，臍部懸空，的括不同凡品云。於是，蟹販咸以「洋澄湖」爲號召，而上海人吃蟹，也有非「洋澄湖」不可之勢！然據調查，洋澄湖產蟹不豐，即在大年，也不過八百担至一千担，以之分銷京滬綫各地，上海能幾何？又息够老饕大嚼？這且不去管它，反正吃個名氣，也是快意的事。</p>
<p>秋冬之交，南市大碼頭，十六舖，虹口頭壩，老閘橋沿浜，情緒分外緊張。蓋因長江下水輪船，蘇·錫·崑·太·杭·嘉·松·湖·航船傍岸，必有各地產蟹運來。蟹販鵠候已久，一見貨到，蜂擁上前，選購所需要的貨色，待銀貨兩訖，然後選擇大小，配搭雌雄，分置鐵絲籠裏，陳列街頭，供大衆購取。</p>
<p>除小菜塲外，熱鬧馬路口，以及菜館酒肆門前，胥爲蟹攤集中地。其中日昇樓一區，規模尤大，自先施公司迤北至北京路，兩邊人行道門面，全給佔據，蔚成蟹國。同行旣多，竸爭勢所才然，有的以霓虹管為廣告；有的以大喉嚨作招徠，除概稱眞正道地洋澄湖淸水大蟹外，還有把「蟹大王」爲標凖的，所謂蟹大王，每只重的七八兩，定價CRB二十元正。廣式酒家，佈置購究，向不讓人，這一時更鄭重將事，選取一二只大蟹，熱帶魚暫請出屋，養在玻璃缸裏，吸引食客。</p>
<p>燒蟹之法，近年大有進步。已往用水燒煮，蟹在鑊中受熟不住，必翻騰亂竄，致膏脂走散，肉老味淡。十年前，四馬路高長與發明紮煮法，下水之前，騐明正身，縛以五花大纔，使蠻動彈不得，如對付斬犯一般。此法傳，大爲風行，但仍未可謂盡美畫善。因爲用水燒煮，鮮味終必外溢，滲入湯中。於是更事改良，形成今日最講究的隔水蒸法及炭烤法。而炭烤法允稱二十世紀東方食譜唯一重大發明，燒熟的蟹，味鮮肉嫩，膏脂脹滿，色香味三者俱佳。</p>
<p>吃的藝術，由野蠻進步而爲文明，乃自然之過程，但在極端文明之中，略帶野蠻方式，原始風味，往往別有情趣。叫化鷄突然爲士大夫激賞，北方烤羊肉必一手持白干，一條腿擱在凳上，日烤且吃，方才够味。大觀園十二金釵山珍海味嘗得膩了，偷偷地弄來一塊鹿肉，胡亂燒熟，大家你爭我奪，興高彩烈，似乎那時的金陵，猪肉也有黑市，吃蟹的方式，無疑是較爲野蠻的，而情趣也正在野蠻之叩</p>
<p>俗諺有「叫化子吃死蟹隻隻好。」可見吃蟹有品，大槪最够風雅的，則是一面持螯，一面賞菊。戰前，江灣小觀園，浦東市立農塲，漕河涇冠生園農塲，都以藝菊者名，佳種極富。年年今日，必開菊花展覽會，供人賞覽，要是跟園主熟識，或托熟人介紹的話，還可以載酒携蟹前往，賞花之餘，借地宴飮。冠生園農塲更代客設想，附設飲食部，特派專員採辦洋澄湖蟹，在塲烹售。此種豪情勝概，已成陳迹，渺不可得。記者以爲持螯賞菊，情趣固然不錯，但亦不必勉强併爲一事。上海獨多附庸風雅之徒，好像賞菊非持螯不歡；持螯非賞菊不雅。妓院裏一年一度菊花大會，號爲盛舉，硬生生把菊花枝幹屈曲，紮成一斛珠，滿天星，已够俗濁，再堆疊成山。花酒雙台，俗骨一羣，酒醉飯飽之後，草草吃幾個蟹腔，如是而謂雅致，委實不敢恭維！（待續）</p>

<h3>論李玉芝之前程</h3>
<p>— 蘇少卿</p>
<p>李玉芝乃北平戲校坤旦四玉之一。北平戲校第四班以玉名，旦角下一字皆用奇花香草，四玉獨著，四玉者，侯玉蘭李玉茹白玉薇李玉芝也，前三玉皆次第來滬，載譽而去，獨玉芝最後至。或疑玉芝何以遲遲其來？此中有故，玉芝年最少，四玉南來，若遣嫁然，嫁之次序，先長後幼，少小者常俟諸姊妹綠樹成陰，始得作新娘子，此古禮也，若亂次以濟，則於理未合。考生理慣例，姊妹多人，幼者獨聰慧而貴，楊貴妃姊秦國號國二夫人，何嘗不絕美，然尙遜貴妃二分。又不觀戲劇之王寳釧乎？二姊金釧鋃釧，聰慧識力，皆不及三妹，名貴亦不逮，此其鐵證，四玉雖非親姊妹，事例或將同焉。又聞玉芝一病年餘，亦爲未能早日圖南之主因。</p>
<p>吾觀玉芝戲雖不多，然可以斷其前途，將蛟彼三玉更有遠大希望，何以言之，吾觀其聰明較高，而靑衣花旦能兼演，嗓音唱腔姿色做工，全在水平綫上也。今日戲界風氣，演成一身須兼三種角色，始能應看客之要求，如旦角能靑衣花旦刀馬三行技藝，又要嗓音，扮相，武工俱佳，乃得稱爲全才，然三者不可得兼，則靑衣能演花旦戲而有風趣，亦可大紅，若徒工靑衣戲，每不易受羣衆歡迎。玉芝旣以靑衣唱工見長，又兼擅花旦各戲，吾見其雙瞰　有風神，頰上有兩酒渦，每一發笑，好看異常，身材玲瓏，宜於轉折，如「梅龍鎭」「文章會」，等戲，伊人自信絕有把握，蓋大生花旦人才也。彼三玉者，或能靑衣不宜花且，或只長花且，唱工嗓子不佳，尙能載譽享名，由此觀之，玉芝前程，豈可量耶？</p>
<h3>梨園動態</h3>
<p>更新舞臺刻已約就童芷苓遲世恭閻世善，以繼李宗義李玉芝李多奎之後，至於現有配角，如傅德威關德咸慈少泉王玉讓殷金振高德松等，准全部挽留，惟小生周維俊，則易以江世玉，因周在平另有他約，不便久留海上也。</p>
<p>天蟾舞臺最近已邀就楊寳森鄭冰如，楊鄭二人，言明合作，不分前後，戲單兩面分印，以示並牌之意。一昨冰如來函，謂公事業已說妥，款亦收訖，准本月六日乘機甫下，登臺當在十日左右。</p>
<p>黃金吳素秋葉盛章，演至本月六日打住，不再蟬聯，七日起將由富連成小班接演夜塲，至於程硯秋之秋聲社，已決定十一日夜塲開始登臺，老生貫盛習及配角塲面等，准於日內乘火車南來，明後日即可到達滬埠。</p>
<p>吳素秋離滬後，將先至天津，應中國大戲院之邀演唱短局，小生俞振飛將隨之偕行，聞兪此次願加入吳劇團，係由北平戲劇報社長朱復昌君所拉攏，每月包銀，大約爲聯準票六千元云。宋寳羅宋紫萍在蘇州開明大戲院出演，一再賡續，售座仍盛，現經情商挽留，准再續演十天，至本月十日滿期，即率隊北歸，一說將赴寗演唱短局。</p>
<h3>李健吾「雲彩霞」獻演</h3>
<p>— 逸香</p>
<p>夏霞雕滬前最後演出　顧徳剛東山再起合演</p>
<p>上海劇壇漸漸形成天下三分的局面，「上藝」鎭坐「卡爾登」以「大馬戲團」奠定復興的基礎，「中中」劇因內備居「麗華」，聘吳仭之等加入力圖振作，而「蘭心」在十月六日起由新興的藝光劇團演出。「藝光」由「華藝」蛻變而成，但再由夏霞，顧　剛，林彬等加入，聲勢大有後來居上，第一個劇目決定爲李健吾編劇，朱瑞鈞導演之「雲彩霞」。</p>
<p>「雲彩霞」是一個五幕大悲劇，把一個聞名遐邇的紅女伶生活爲背景。同時介紹當時一般闊人先生們的捧角在，和京戲班後台的風光。使人想起了「秋海棠」的小說也是如此，而很受人歡迎。「雲彩霞」非但與「秋海棠」有異曲同工之妙，而有許多地方情節曲折，故事動人，實在是最近劇目所少見的。演員有夏霞，蓋蘭，黃宗江，黃宗英，蔣天流，王祺等，還是有一個使人興奮的消息，當上海劇藝社以「人之初」定天下時，那時梁主角顧德剛的演技深得各界擁護，闊別劇壇三年之久，這次加入客串，的確可以使「雲彩霞」生色不少。</p>
<p>夏霞決定在最近期內遠行一次，約期就在這個月裏面，恐怕非短時間內重能返滬，「雲彩霞」是她離滬前的最後演出，愛看夏霞演技的觀衆，一定願意多看一次她的作品的。</p>
<h3>防癆影展　明日開幕</h3>
<p>— 良</p>
<p>沉默了好久的攝影界，明日起又將充分地活躍起來，因爲上海防癆運動委員會主辦的攝影名作展覽大會，將在梅蘭芳博士揭幕和海上二十餘位名媛翦綵所交織的塲合下，向全市市民行見面禮。</p>
<p>靜安寺路大華路口新厦眞是最適宜於攝影展覽了！三層樓全部九大房間，佈滿了大小照片約三百幀。最精彩的就是攝影界名宿郞靜山的傑作六十餘幀，奇麗的風景，細膩的人像，顯示了近代攝影藝術的飛速進步，它全帶給人們理想和靈感，深深地佈全到人間眞善美的綜合表現。餘如盧施福，陳傳霖，胡伯翔等的作品，亦可說是藝術的結晶，它的每一角面反射出人類的聰明，智慧和技巧。展覽日期約十天，雖然並非「不取分文」，但是要知道它的內容，而親眼先睹的人，以爲化數元門票和二三個鐘頭把自己融解在對藝術的欣賞中，間接幫助了貧苦的肺癆病人，一舉數得，那是很上算的</p>
<h3>王熙春　重返銀壇</h3>
<p>正當中聯改組時王熙春却因在新婚燕爾期內並沒有加入，然而不論在中聯當局或萬千影迷，無不希望王熙春仍繼續在水銀燈下工作，現在，還願望終於是實現了，王熙春在重重情誼下，已與中聯正式簽訂特約合同，第一部戲也已決定了，那是屠光啟導演的梅娘曲」。「梅娘曲」不是陳燕燕主演嗎？爲什麼要調動呢？那是有原因的，陳燕燕自一蝴蝶夫人」至「芳華虛度」，都是大悲劇，「梅娘曲」的內容，又是苦盡慘絕，所以陳燕向公司提出要求來演幾部喜劇，恰巧王熙春加入，「梅娘曲」就作王熙春重返銀壇第一聲，其他演員如嚴俊張琬等都不動。</p>
<h3>梅壽</h3>
<p>— 筱</p>
<p>梅蘭芳博士，前日在私邸度其四九誕辰，梨園中人，程硯秋等及親友數十人，紛往道賀：惟外客到者寥寥，蓋梅氏以世變方殷，不欲舖張揚厲。益以感受風寒，患傷風甚劇，近亦極少酬應，外傳其短鬚已薙，並非事實。</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（一〇）　飛來峰</p>
<p>維城去所父親的遺像拿下，父親的遺像，可不比母親的遺像，掛上去的日子久了，釘子是跟着銹了，繩子也有些爛了，繩子上和框緣的灰塵，也積得更厚了。維城才把鏡框抬得一抬「拍」一聲，那鏡框便掉到地下來，連伸手去搶，都搶不住。他忙着隨了鏡框俯身下去，把鏡框端起來，回身放在桌上。可是一方玻璃，已經碎成了七八方，有幾方已經不在框子裏，維城張了嘴，心中有了說不出的慚愧。他想着家裏還有好幾個鏡框，不知道尺寸是不是和像片相符。他把框子翻到背而來，去了一塊底板，想把父親的遺像取出來，另外去裝框　，可是驚人的發現，就發現在這時候。</p>
<p>在底板和像片的中間，夾着一張不是四寸便是六寸的男子半身像片。有這麼十張像片，是不奇，奇就奇在像片旁邊的題款，右邊是「惠芬女士惠存「六個宇，左邊是程炳謹贈」四個字。他眼簾裏耀進惠芬和程炳字樣，不由得不驚異了，驚異得幾乎要使他發在了。惠芬是葉大太太的名字，程炳是有殺父之仇的仇人，如何不要驚異。他突然的走到門口，把兩扇門掩上了，再回到桌子旁邊來，捧起像片來，細細一看。一看，是看程炳　字，並沒有錯誤；再看，看那影中人程炳，倒也方面大耳，在二十歲到三十的年齡。他把左手揑了像片，右手却握了個拳頭，對程炳臉上試一試；，一邊又咬緊了牙齒，咬得的吱吱吱的。如果眼睛裏眞能出火的話？他的火早已冒出來了。他的心，在腔子裏卜通卜通的跳，把奉頭拍着胸脯口，想吐一口氣，可又悶的吐不出來。他再一看時，程炳的臉，像是在那裏見過的，只是想不起在那裏見過。把像片放在桌子上，捧了頭思索一下，在屋子裏走來走去，　對像片看看，終於被他想出來了。（二二〇）</p>

<h3>After the Al Alamein Front, British Attempted Landing Fails, Frontline Battles Reach Climax, Italian Aircraft of All Types Deployed</h3>
<p>Reuter Dispatch from Berlin, 3rd: Well-informed sources here claimed last night that the British attempt to land behind the German Al Alamein front line was thwarted by our forces last night.</p>
<p>Havas Dispatch from Stockholm, 3rd: According to reports from both belligerent parties, the battles on the Egyptian front have now reached their climax. The intensity is unprecedented. Semi-official sources in Berlin stated that the British offensive, originally intended to decide the Egyptian campaign in one decisive battle, has failed after six days of intense fighting. However, the German High Command has acknowledged that the fighting is intense, even more so than before. The Italian High Command's battle report this morning also indicated the same, but stated that the enemy's offensive had been contained by the Axis forces, and that the Axis forces had launched repeated counter-attacks. In addition, the intensity of the air battles is also rare. Meanwhile, the British Middle East Command stated that Allied infantry divisions made significant progress south of the coast yesterday. The intense tank battles between the two sides raged throughout the day yesterday, and the intensity has not diminished. Axis attacks on the coastal front have been repelled. The British Air Force bombed enemy positions, inflicting heavy losses. Yesterday, British aircraft lost thirteen planes, while at least five German Junkers aircraft were shot down, four other aircraft were shot down, and seven caught fire after being hit.</p>
<p>Reuter Dispatch from the German Führer's Headquarters, 3rd: Today's German war report stated that the Egyptian battles are intensifying. Enemy tank units that penetrated the northern sector of the Al Alamein line were unable to advance due to our forces' fierce counter-attacks. German and Italian air forces are continuously bombing British mechanized units, enemy artillery positions, and rear lines of communication. Five British aircraft were shot down in the Mediterranean, one of which was shot down by a German submarine.</p>
<p>Reuter Dispatch from Rome, 3rd: The Italian High Command announced this afternoon that the battles on the Egyptian front became more intense yesterday. Large formations of fresh enemy troops advanced towards the Axis positions. Our forces fought bravely and launched repeated counter-attacks, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, with losses of over ninety tanks. Our side also suffered heavy losses. The battles are currently raging. Our forces are deploying all types of aircraft to attack enemy troops and the enemy's rear lines. In multiple air battles, our fighter planes shot down three enemy planes, and German planes shot down twelve enemy planes. At the same time, while escorting transport ships, German and Italian aircraft repelled several attacking enemy aircraft and shot down four twin-engine enemy aircraft. Our navy also sank one enemy submarine.</p>
<p>Reuter Dispatch from Berlin, 3rd: Yesterday morning, British tank units launched a large-scale offensive, which was crushed after twenty-four hours of intense fighting. The British forces on the Al Alamein front have now ceased their offensive activities.</p>
<p>Reuter Dispatch from Stockholm, 3rd: London newspapers commented on the North African campaign, stating that the success of the Allied offensive depends on control of the sea and air. Once victorious, large numbers of warships and aircraft can be redeployed to other fronts.</p>
<h3>Battle Enters Second Phase, 2,000 Allied Soldiers Captured</h3>
<p>Havas Dispatch from Berlin, 2nd: The following report on the situation on the Egyptian front has just been released here: On the sixth morning of the British offensive, the Axis positions from the Qattara Depression to the coast are still in the hands of the German-Italian allied forces. As a result of two fierce British attacks, the Axis positions were broken through in a very narrow area, but this offensive was quickly repelled. The enemy suffered heavy losses, retreated in panic, and even abandoned their original positions. When the Axis forces began their counter-offensive in Egypt, a German detachment, isolated, re-established contact with the main force. This detachment, outnumbered, fought with unprecedented bravery. The "hedgehog" position it held was extremely important, and the large British forces were thereby constrained, thwarting their attempt to break through the Axis lines. As a result of the fierce fighting yesterday, the communication lines for other isolated strongholds have also been restored. They immediately joined forces with the main force of the German-Italian "blitz unit" to attack. At the same time, semi-official sources here claim that since the British launched another offensive at dawn on the 31st of this month, the battle has entered its second phase. The German side is confident about the future of the battle. This final British attack copied old tactics, but still could not go far beyond the Axis outposts. The battle is now taking place on the Axis main defensive line. So far, there has been no tank battle anywhere on the front line. Yesterday, multiple air battles took place over the Al Alamein area. Groups of "Curtiss" and "Spitfire" aircraft attempted to attack Axis positions, but before reaching their destination, they were intercepted by our "Messerschmitt" aircraft. The enemy aircraft were dispersed in the high altitude, and four enemy aircraft were lost. Another team of British bombers was also driven back by our fighter planes and anti-aircraft guns, failing to carry out their bombing attempt. As for the German dive bombers, they attacked British tanks near the Al Alamein railway station and were very successful.</p>
<p>Reuter Dispatch from Berlin, 3rd: It is claimed here that in the recent two days, the German-Italian allied forces counter-attacked in the northern Al Alamein front, capturing 2,000 enemy soldiers, seizing 51 anti-tank guns and a large number of supplies, and destroying 100 tanks.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, 2nd: Since the British Eighth Army launched its offensive on the Al Alamein front, it has been frequently subjected to fierce attacks from the Axis air force and artillery, and has been frustrated. Therefore, in the past two or three days, large numbers of British troops have been reinforced from Cairo and Alexandria. General Rommel, in order to implement a war of attrition strategy, deliberately avoids the main force, only using heavy artillery to bombard the British counter-attacking troops, and using tank guns to destroy British tanks. In the past two or three days, the number of British tanks destroyed by the Germans has reached 100. Since the start of the counter-offensive, the number of British tanks destroyed has reached 400. Currently, fierce ground battles are unfolding with the northwest Al Alamein area as the center. Once the Axis forces have used artillery tactics to exhaust the British tank units, they will launch a full-scale offensive.</p>
<p>Reuter Dispatch from Berlin, 3rd: Three Hurricane aircraft attacked a German motorcade on the coastal highway in North Africa. One of the aircraft was hit by German machine gun fire. The aircraft was severely damaged and forced to land. The Australian pilot was captured.</p>
<h3>New Advisor, Ishiwatari Arrives in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Domei Dispatch from Nanjing, 3rd: The newly appointed advisor, Ishiwatari, arrived here yesterday. At 11:00 AM today, he visited Chairman Wang at his official residence, accompanied by Japanese Ambassador Mamoru Shigemitsu. Chairman Wang formally invited Ishiwatari to take office as the highest financial advisor to the National Government. Ishiwatari accepted. The meeting lasted for half an hour.</p>
<h3>National Training Convention Ends Yesterday in Japan</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, 3rd: The 13th Meiji Shrine National Training Convention, which opened on October 29th, has now been held for six days.

<h3>Financial Authorities Deny Rumors: Reports of Currency System Change are Inaccurate</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 3rd: Rumors have been circulating in the market for days, saying that the currency system will soon be reformed, with Central Reserve Bank notes being exchanged for new currency at a rate of four or five yuan. The rumors have become increasingly prevalent in Shanghai, causing panic among the people and rising prices, which is of great concern to the financial future. The reporter specifically visited the financial authorities to inquire about the matter. It was reported that the government has already determined its policy on the currency system and has no intention of making any changes. Recently, the government announced a final exchange deadline of one month for old and new currencies to avoid losses to the people and to allow the Central Reserve Bank notes to be widely promoted and become the sole currency. The rumors circulating in the market are completely unfounded and should not be easily believed to avoid causing disturbances. This is specially published to dispel the rumors. It is hoped that all sectors will not listen lightly to avoid suffering losses.</p>
<h3>Greater East Asia Writers' Conference Opened Yesterday in Tokyo</h3>
<p>Domei Dispatch from Tokyo, 3rd: The Greater East Asia Writers' Conference was solemnly opened at the Imperial Theater here at 10:00 AM on the 3rd. More than twenty representatives and assembly participants and guests from China, Japan, and Manchukuo attended. After the formalities, Kume Masao, Director of the Japan Literary Patriotic Association, delivered the opening address. Subsequently, all the delegates of the conference unanimously elected Japanese representative Hiroshi Shimomura as the chairman of the conference and delivered his inaugural address. Then, Sub-Director Okumura of the Information Bureau, Director Taniwaki of the Army Ministry's Press Department representing the Minister of the Greater East Asia Ministry, Section Chief Hirade of the Navy Ministry's Press Department, and Secretary-General Goto of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association delivered congratulatory speeches. Representatives from the Republic of China, Zhou Huaren, Qian Daosun, Zhabu, and representatives from Manchukuo, Gutin, and Japanese representative, Kan Kikuchi, delivered speeches one after another and read out the texts addressed to the conference by representatives from Thailand, Vietnam, and Burma.

<p>Domei Dispatch from Tokyo, 3rd: At the opening ceremony of the Greater East Asia Writers' Conference, Okumura, the Sub-Director of the Japanese Information Bureau, said in his speech that as the forces of Anglo-American aggression have been driven out of East Asia, Asia's existence has a bright future. The so-called cultural crisis of today is nothing more than the existing world culture manipulated by the United States and Britain. However, a new Asian culture has begun to regenerate in the future, so there is no cultural crisis to speak of. If we look at the culture of the United States and Britain again, we find that they only use culture as a means to protect their lives. This kind of culture is only a usurious, non-laboring culture, and also an extractive commercial culture. In contrast, Asian culture is born from the ultimate purpose of life and is a noble culture of respect for humanity and respect for labor. This culture is not only expressed in life, but also in art and religion. Therefore, Asian culture is a culture in which religion, politics, and education are integrated, and is a comprehensive and unified culture, which is completely different from the divisive culture of the United States and Britain. Under the current situation, "Pan-Asian unity" has been realized. In the future, we must use common ideals and morals to achieve shared happiness and hardship, co-existence and co-prosperity. Therefore, it is necessary for all Asian nations to realize the greatness of Asia and enhance their self-confidence. Therefore, it is hoped that all of you can become the second Muhammad, the first Confucius, and the second Sakyamuni.</p>

<h3>Intercepted the Mountain Road of Transcaucasia by the German Army; Artillery Fights between Two Armies on the Banks of the Volga River; Nalcrucknowledge fell</h3>
<p>Berlin, 3rd, Havas News Agency: After the German army occupied Alagir on the Terek front, Okhiniki is threatened, and the Ossetian military road has also been cut off. Because the central Caucasus Mountains are as high as 4,000 meters, it is difficult to pass in the autumn. The Soviet army between the Terek River and Mount Elbrus has little chance of escaping. The fighting in the Stalingrad area is calm. The German engineering team has made slight progress in the industrial area on the west bank of the Volga River. The supply of the Soviet army in the city is becoming increasingly difficult.</p>
<p>Berlin, 3rd, Havas News Agency: It is claimed here that the only mountain road through the Central Caucasus, the Ausztians military road, has been cut off due to the German occupation of Alagir. The highway is 293 kilometers long. Alagir is located 50 kilometers west of Okhiniki. It is the terminal station of the Weistoff Grosny Railway. The surrounding land is extremely fertile. There are small arsenals and chemical plants in the city. The lead mine in the south is very rich.</p>
<p>Guilin, 3rd, Havas News Agency: The Caspian Sea has been bombed by German aircraft many times last week. Baku is the center of Caspian Sea transportation. It exports 9,000,000 tons of kerosene every year. However, the northern Caspian Sea freezes for about three months every year, which hinders shipping. Recently, British and American war equipment has also been transported from Iran to the Soviet Union via the Caspian Sea. It is estimated that there are about 120 Soviet ships in the Caspian Sea, including 75 oil tankers.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd, Central News Agency: A special telegram from Berlin stated that, according to sources from the German military headquarters, the last bridge in Stalingrad was completely destroyed by the German army on the 2nd under the fierce bombing of the German air force and the continuous bombardment of the German heavy artillery. In addition, the German artillery units on the west bank of the Volga River also fiercely bombarded the Soviet artillery positions on the east bank on the 1st. The terrain of the German artillery positions is higher than that of the Soviet artillery positions on the opposite bank, so the German army has a clear advantage in the artillery battle between the two armies. In addition, the powerful anti-aircraft artillery positions of the German army on the west bank of the river have been completed recently since they were actively built.</p>
<p>Ankara, 3rd, Havas News Agency: Moscow telegram, after the German army occupied the city of Nalchik last Thursday, the Soviet military headquarters only admitted in the war report last night that the city had fallen.</p>
<p>Street fighting in Stalingrad is still going on</p>
<p>German Head of State's Camp, 3rd: Today's German military report stated that the fighting in western Caucasus is very fierce. Our army's counterattack has made progress. The Slovak army annihilated the surrounded enemy. The German army east of Alagir continued its offensive, penetrating deep into the enemy's minefields and strong defenses. The enemy army suffered heavy losses from our planes bombing. An enemy armored train was destroyed. The German army in the Kalmuk Mountains once counterattacked, repelling the invading cavalry, causing many casualties. Fierce street fighting in Stalingrad is still going on. Our rapid-descent bombers attacked the enemy's strongholds north of the city. The enemy lost ground again. Repeated counterattacks were ineffective. Our fighter squadrons bombed the railway east of the Volga River and the enemy's equipment for crossing the river. The Soviet army attempted to cross the Don River from several locations, but was severely beaten by the Romanian and Hungarian armies. Italian aircraft bombed Soviet positions at low altitude. The Hungarian army destroyed Soviet bunkers on the east bank of the Don River many times, capturing many enemies. The enemy army southeast of Lake Ilmen is still resisting stubbornly in the swampy lowlands. Last month, German aircraft sank a total of 33 Soviet transport ships and cargo ships, including many oil tankers and one patrol ship. In addition, 32 cargo ships and many warships were damaged.</p>
<h3>US Governor and Congressman Elections Yesterday; No Unexpected Results Expected; The Democratic Party is Expected to Still Hold a Majority</h3>
<p>Washington, 2nd, Havas News Agency: According to the provisions of the US Constitution, all members of the House of Representatives and one-third of the senators are re-elected every two years. This year is the year of re-election, and the vote has been scheduled for the first Tuesday of this month. Governors whose terms have expired must also be re-elected at the same time. Therefore, the people of the country will be busy voting on that day. According to political observers here, this vote will not have surprising results. It is expected that the Republican Party will win some seats in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, but the Democratic Party will still hold a majority. The most noteworthy event in this election is the re-election of the Governor of New York. The State Attorney, Dewey, is the Republican candidate, while Bennett is the Democratic candidate. President Roosevelt initially supported Senator Mette as a candidate, but was opposed by the Democratic branches of Albany and New York. He decided to support Bennett. Senator Mette usually spares no effort to support the New Deal, while Bennett is a conservative member of the Democratic Party. A recent public opinion survey showed that 53% of the people supported the Republican candidate Dewey, 39% supported the Democratic candidate Bennett, and the remaining 8% supported the American Labor Party candidate Arfang. If Dewey is elected tomorrow, the Republican Party will have great hope in the 1944 presidential election. Government officials and Democrats also believe that Dewey's views on the post-war reconstruction plan are completely different from President Roosevelt's views. Therefore, they believe that Dewey's election is very dangerous. The Democratic Party has expressed its opinion that if Dewey is elected President of the United States after the current war ends, "the mistake of 1919 will be repeated." Therefore, if the Republican Party can win the next presidential election, its candidate should be Wiggy, at least in terms of foreign policy, his views are completely consistent with President Roosevelt.</p>
<h3>Australia will limit consumption of civilian goods</h3>
<p>Saigon, 3rd, Havas News Agency: A telegram from the Pear states that the Australian Commissioner of Price Control, Goplan, yesterday announced that Australia will further limit the consumption of civilian goods and concentrate production.

<p>Lisbon, 3rd, Havas News Agency: According to Washington news, the United States elected 32 governors, 35 senators, and 434 representatives today. The American people are indifferent and uninterested. The general public believes that the Republican Party will gain a little. Dewey, the Republican candidate for governor of New York, may be elected. Republican leader Bretton is running for governor of the state of Okhai, and they are all opposed to Roosevelt's policies and hope to be nominated as presidential candidates in 1944.</p>
<p>Saigon, 3rd, Havas News Agency: According to news from Sydney, the working hours of Australian officials will be increased from five and a half days per week to six days, in order to transfer strong men to participate in national defense work. If they do not work on Saturday afternoon, they will extend their working hours at ordinary times. About 15,000 officials will be affected by this decree.</p>
<h3>The United States Unifies Intelligence Propaganda and will Establish a Supreme Authority</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd, Havas News Agency: According to the latest issue of the American "Newsweek", the United States will announce the establishment of a supreme authority for propaganda and intelligence soon. The authority will take over the intelligence organizations of various departments of the United States, such as the American Affairs Processing Bureau presided over by Davis. One of the main tasks of the new authority is to unify the American broadcasting system. Fourteen private radio stations will be taken over by the government during the war, and 22 new short-wave wireless stations will be established. These radio stations will be divided into two groups, one for psychological warfare and the other for broadcasting news programs to inspire the spirit of overseas American troops and Allied troops.</p>
<h3>Africa in the Midst of Change: Egypt - The Second Gateway of the Center of the War (3)</h3>
<p>The British knew that the defense plan was not just about guarding a local area, and that it would be safer to push out a few more outer layers than to guard a local area. Wasn't it advancing step by step in Libya this spring? Later, the Eighth Army could not hold it, and finally crushed Alexandria in June. The outer layers that had been painstakingly built were broken one by one. At this time, of course, we had to find a way to reorganize the troops.</p>
<p>According to our overall view, since the German army's left claw is preparing to spend the winter, the current article must be to pour all its strength on the right claw. On the British side, they must protect Egypt and enrich the strength of the Mediterranean Sea. If they succeed, they still want to establish a second battlefield, either Greece or Italy. It is possible. From this point of view, both sides have a mission of great importance, which is undoubtedly true. Now we need to ask how far the preparations of both sides have reached.</p>
<p>The outsider originally had no way to speculate on this kind of military deployment, but from the news on the newspapers, we can collect a little bit of information to get a rough idea. Let's first take a look at the two sentences spoken by General Smuts in London: "The past four years of war have taken a defensive stance and have come to an end; now the final offensive has begun..." and said, "The struggle to the death has arrived, we should not give way...".</p>
<p>This tone is very serious, "the final offensive" and "the struggle to the death" are not just for the current local war in Egypt; it is the beginning of a huge decisive battle. From this point of view, the preparations must be quite sufficient. What we know in front of us is that there are only ten British divisions in Egypt, but about 200,000 troops, which is too far from the 12 million troops on the 1,500-mile front of Germany and the Soviet Union last year.</p>
<p>When the German summer offensive was launched, we seemed to have heard that the British, American, and Soviet Union had prepared a gunpowder bag on the Near East plateau, like the Universe Bag of the Yellow-Eyebrowed Arhat. The troops needed for this kind of bag formation will never be only a few hundred thousand. From this point of view, perhaps the so-called ten British divisions only refer to the front line.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the current situation of the German and Italian brothers; according to the statistics on the news, at present, General Rommel commands two tank divisions, two infantry divisions, and seven Italian divisions; all in all, there are about 200,000 troops, but Rommel met with Mr. Shi, and the article was nothing more than adding troops and generals. So the soldiers on the battlefield are only the front line.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the offensive and defensive situation, the German and Italian side is currently based on Libya, the front line is near Alamin, and the goals are Alexandria, Cairo, and Suez: and supplies and reinforcements, etc., must fly across the Mediterranean from the German and Italian mainland, which is inevitable Some are laborious, such as ambushes in the middle, and the British navy often attacks along the coastline, which will have some discounts.</p>
<p>As for the British and American Allied forces, in addition to being able to obtain most of the supplies from Egypt. In terms of ammunition, there are probably not a few prepared in the Near East. At the same time, the navy can be used along the coast to make some landing tricks. In terms of large plans, if West Africa and South Africa are arranged successfully, the American supply can be directly transported from Dakar or Liberia to Egypt, Sudan, and then to the Egyptian front line. Therefore, from the perspective of both sides, this North African war will become a very lively drama. Perhaps the world war will be settled in the North African region, which is unknown.</p>
<p>The above is a lot of nonsense, but I still haven't explained the three keys to the Egyptian gateway mentioned in the previous article. I'm very sorry.</p>
<p>These three keys are the Egyptian-Sudan Highway for transportation, the Suez for the Eurasian transportation hub, and Alexandria for the military stronghold. I have pointed them out in the previous article. I am going to take a look at each of them to see what these keys are.</p>
<p>The first key involves a wide range. If you want to analyze it in detail, you must start from the Three Emperors and Five Emperors, such as the history, customs, human relations, changes, mountains and rivers of Egypt and Sudan, how Egypt and Egyptian Sudan are divided, etc. In this way, there will be a lot of nonsense again, and readers only need to flip through the African geography, which is much clearer.</p>
<p>I just want to briefly describe the formation of the Sudan Highway here, but I also consider the repeated narration of Libya in the next article, so I can only briefly say a few words.</p>
<p>The situation in Egyptian Sudan has been extremely complicated and subtle since it was operated by the British. Since the British allowed Egypt to be independent and maintained a never-ending marriage, why are they unwilling to create the same situation in Sudan? First, the British are naturally stingy and will not easily give up the rights and interests in their hands. Second, in the south of Sudan, the entire southeastern half of Africa, except for Portuguese Mozambique and the French Madagascar on the sea, are all British territories, so it is a very heavy matter to separate a part of Egypt to be independent. How can we let Sudan get out of hand?</p>
<p>Moreover, in the summer of 1936, the Turks regained the armament of the Dardanelles Strait at the Montreux Conference, thanks to the British's behind-the-scenes efforts. Unexpectedly, this move caused Italy to send troops to Rhodes, and at the same time, Italy stationed a large army in Libya in order to prevent future troubles. The British saw Italy's various actions and also carried out large-scale military preparations in Egypt as a countermeasure. However, this disturbed the Egyptian people so much that the British gentlemen, in order to eliminate this emotional impulse of the Egyptians, resolutely established an agreement in 1936 based on the conditions of 1922 and 1930, allowing Egypt to be formally independent and allowing Egyptians to immigrate to Egyptian Sudan without restrictions.</p>
<h3>The Great Nile Iron Bridge</h3>
<p>Cairo, the capital of Egypt, is the largest Islamic city on the Nile River. More than one million Africans, Orientals, and Europeans live here. There are many tourists in winter. The picture shows a bird's-eye view of the great iron bridge over the Nile River in Cairo. The wind is blowing, and people come and go like shuttles.</p>

<h3>It is Urgent to Improve the Retail of Oil and Sugar, Relieve the Suffering of Citizens; The Authorities Dispatched Personnel to Monitor the Sale of Sugar and the Separate Sale of Edible Oil, and the Market Can Restore to Normal</h3>
<p>In the past week, the supply of edible oil in the city has been insufficient. Although some were obtained from the military distribution office on the 30th of last month, they were sold out soon due to the small quantity. Therefore, most of the separate sales offices have been out of stock. According to reliable sources, the recent lack of oil rations is not due to too little oil in stock, but due to the reorganization of the Asia Development Board and the temporary suspension of the office. It is expected that the situation will soon be restored to what it was a week ago.</p>
<p>Crack down on the black market</p>
<p>The police authorities in the two concessions are now considering ways to crack down on the edible oil black market. At the same time, they hope that citizens will assist in reporting. Once it is verified, the distribution will be stopped and other penalties will be imposed. Regarding the possibility of distributing oil according to the population, the Edible Oil Industry Office is scheduled to hold a council meeting on the 6th of this month to thoroughly discuss it. Recently, citizens from all walks of life have been extremely dissatisfied with the oil market situation, and there has been more criticism of the internal structure of the Oil Industry Office. The edible oil black market is actually caused by the big oil merchants in the industry. The difficulty for citizens to buy edible oil is increasing day by day. It is hoped that the edible oil distribution authorities will take necessary steps as soon as possible to relieve public suffering.</p>
<p>Supervise sugar sales</p>
<p>In order to thoroughly eliminate the sugar black market and strictly supervise the widespread sale of sugar by Class A retailers to eliminate malpractices and maintain proper food for the people, the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office has appointed 116 supervisors, inspectors, and investigators. Each of the 96 retailers who distribute more than 30 bags of sugar will be assigned a supervisor to be stationed in the store to supervise the sales. The more than 300 retailers who distribute less than 30 bags of sugar will be randomly checked by inspectors and investigators to check the sales accounts from time to time. Ordinary food households must hold a citizen's certificate or residence identity certificate to purchase sugar. In addition, all Class A retail stores are strictly ordered not to secretly raise prices, reduce the amount, or engage in mixed situations. Purchasers are allowed to report them for investigation. The English "The Times" queued up to buy. The English "The Times" reported that the Shanghai Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office has publicly announced in the Chinese newspapers that from November 1st, citizens can purchase 5 yuan of sugar from the retail stores in their respective districts with their citizen's certificates. However, on Sunday and yesterday (2nd), residents were still seen queuing up to buy in sugar stores all over the city, and only those who were quick were able to buy only half a pound of sugar. It is heard that there are still black market transactions in sugar. Some sugar dealers actually sell 10 pounds, 20 pounds, or even 50 pounds of sugar at a secret price of 7 yuan per pound at a time. Ordinary residents have to wait for several hours in front of the sugar stores, and when it is not their turn, they often see the notice board "Sugar Sold Out" hung up high.</p>
<p>Supply is less than demand</p>
<p>Therefore, the public is still asking the authorities to intervene. Many people believe that only municipal organs can intervene and distribute sugar according to the population can control the sugar situation. According to the announcement of the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office, residents of each district can purchase 5 yuan of sugar with their citizen's certificates, and it is reiterated that there is enough sugar in stock for long-term needs. However, according to the reporter's investigation, this situation does not exist. The number of Chinese and foreign residents queuing up in front of the sugar stores is increasing day by day. Most retail stores only sell sugar for 10 to 15 minutes every morning. Several retail stores on Jing'an Temple Road open at 8:00 am and start selling sugar, and sell out their allocation in ten minutes.</p>
<p>Half a pound per person</p>
<p>A manager of a store said that the store's daily allocation is 24 pounds, which is sold in 48 packages of half a pound each, instead of following the method of purchasing 5 yuan (one and a half pounds) of sugar per person set by the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office. Other retail stores also sell half a pound to each customer. Chinese and foreign customers in front of each store are divided into two rows. Some families, old and young, are also mixed in the long line, waiting to buy sugar to meet their daily needs. A certain southern goods store in the Central District still forces customers to buy the same amount of other goods, which violates the regulations set by the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office.</p>
<h3>Public buses operate from Jiangwan Road to Edward Road</h3>
<p>The United News Agency's local news reported that, according to the Shanghai Daily News, the Huazhong Public Bus Company has opened a new route south of Suzhou Creek, starting from the Shanghai Shrine and passing through Jiangwan Road, Wusong Road, Haining Road, North Sichuan Road, Sichuan Road to Edward Road. The first public bus was seen passing Sichuan Road Bridge on Tuesday morning at 7:00 am. This new public bus is called Route 25, with a total length of 2 kilometers and a fare of 2 military notes. A bus runs every 5 to 10 minutes. There are buses going back and forth every day from 7:00 am to 10:00 pm.</p>
<h3>Blackout Exercise to Continue Soon</h3>
<p>The English "The Times" reported that an officer from the Air Defense Section of the Public Concession Police Department claimed that the blackout exercise in Shanghai will be resumed in mid-month. The rumors that it will be held on the 4th or 6th are not true. The next blackout exercise will be held suddenly, so the authorities may only publish an announcement in the newspapers announcing that the blackout will be implemented between a certain day and a certain day. Residents should be prepared at any time to avoid being caught off guard.</p>
<h3>Rice shops sell ration rice with adulteration</h3>
<p>In addition to the whole rice allocated for each period of population rationing, it is often mixed with broken rice. However, recently, some rice shops have mixed yellow sand, gravel, or coarse millet in the broken rice they sell in an attempt to make a profit. This kind of adulterated substance is extremely broken and mixed because the broken rice is extremely broken and mixed. It cannot be discovered until it is washed. Because substances such as coarse sand can only be removed after being washed away by water and sinking. Also, those who mix broken rice in whole rice, this kind of profiteering behavior not only violates the original intention of the authorities to regulate food for the people, but also affects the nutrition and health of residents. I hope that the rice shops will realize this as soon as possible, otherwise the authorities will take measures to crack down on them.</p>
<h3>Jiang Bingquan appointed as Director of the Nanshi Collection Office</h3>
<p>Chen Menglai, director of the Nanshi Collection Office of the Bureau of Finance, was recently ordered to be transferred to the Chongming District Financial Specialist. The vacancy has been filled by Yuan Houzhi, director of the bureau, who has appointed Jiang Bingquan as the director. It is said that he will take office on November 6th. Jiang is good at finance and has served in financial positions in Jiangsu Province.</p>
<h3>Winter Clothing Drive</h3>
<p>The Shanghai YWCA, in view of the approaching cold weather, believes that the general poor compatriots are still struggling to find food, and how can they have the surplus to seek winter clothing. The association is preparing for the future and continues the purpose of distributing winter clothing in previous years. It has launched a winter clothing drive, hoping to sew 500 sets of new cotton clothes (1,000 pieces), each set costing 60 yuan (if there is a surplus, the number will be increased), totaling 30,000 Central Reserve Certificates, and collect 5,000 to 10,000 pieces of old cotton clothes. The committee members are now planning the sewing and distribution. All kind-hearted ladies in the society who are willing to donate money, cloth, cotton, old clothes, shoes, socks, hats, gloves, etc. and cooperate to make this a great event are welcome. The association's address is 638 Weihaiwei Road.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Fellow Association Handles Small-Scale Loans</h3>

<h3>Rongwu Society 70th Sutra Lecture</h3>
<p>The 70th sutra lecture of the Rongwu Sutra Society, Hong Qingdao, said in his lecture on the Taoist method: "The principle of Tao is one yin and one yang. The evolution of the great Tao begins with Lao Tzu. Once the void is judged, the pure and turbid are separated. After the creation of Hongmeng, the Five Old Emperors govern the world. Then there are the Five Sons, the Shangyuan Ziwei, the Great Emperor, called the Tianguan, who is Tang Yao. The Zhongyuan Qingxu Great Emperor is called the Diguan, who is Yu Shun. The Xiayuan Dongyin Great Emperor is called the Shuiguan, who is Xia Yu. The Three Origins circulate to govern Shenzhou. The East belongs to the Zhunti, and the West belongs to the reception. They are all disciples of the Yuanshi Daozu, who reported the teachings of the Xiantian Wuji Daozu. After Xuanyuan, the Jintian Clan ruled the central master of the thirty-three heavens, who is the Jinque Jade Emperor, surrounded by the three and two heavens in the four directions. Each heaven has an Emperor to govern the people of his teachings, which are not connected to each other. The Qingxu Great Emperor is located in the center, enlightening the poor and evolving the great law, which will be used to specially build the Xiantian, Qingji Orthodox sect, to turn the fortunes of plunder and save those who are destined." After the lecture, it was announced that the next lecture will be given by Mr. Yang Zhongyi on the study of the Book of Changes, and Mr. Zhao Buming will talk about the origin of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Christianity.</p>
<h3>Xu Xingbin's Birthday Celebration for Education</h3>
<p>Xu Xingbin, a famous reporter from Zhejiang and former provincial assemblyman, will celebrate his 70th birthday on the tenth day of the tenth lunar month this year. His disciples Zhang and Xu and others plan to celebrate his birthday. Xu firmly refused. Friends in Shanghai, such as Cheng Xuechuan, Sun Jincai, and two historians, and fellow villagers, such as Xu Shenru and Shen Mianfu, used Xu's words "Who is busy for a year in Shu Huai at seventy, most of the sacrifices are in the locality" and "Arrange a good scene to plant peach and plum trees, and beg for new shade to protect the Zisang" to propose to build a school in Xu's village Zhouwang Temple as a birthday gift for Xu, saving all the pomp of the birthday celebration, and using the birthday celebration as an education fund to fulfill Xu's intention of "Celebrating the birthday and waiting for the return to the hometown". The collection offices in Shanghai are Yuanchangzhuang, Fuxingli, Beijing Road, Hangzhou is Wuyuanzhuang, Zhongqing Avenue, and Xiajiashi is Yongxingzhuang, Zhongning Lane.</p>
<h3>Young Female Painter Li Qingping's Art Exhibition</h3>

She graduated from the Shanghai Xinhua Art Academy and taught in middle schools in this city and Anhui Province before the war. Later, she was invited to teach at Nanyang Kuncheng Girls' High School and went to Nanyang to teach. Ms. Li has profound attainments in Western painting, and her landscape paintings are particularly valuable. She has held exhibitions in Kuala Lumpur, Hankou, and other places, which have been highly praised by all sectors. The art master Xu Beihong praised her as the most promising young painter in China. This time, she came to Shanghai at the invitation of friends and held an exhibition on the fourth floor of the Great New Company department store for a week starting yesterday. All sectors are welcome to visit.</p>

<h3>A Tour of Six Major Libraries with Rich Collections (3)</h3>
<p>Complete Collections of Chinese and Foreign Books</p>
<p>Hoping the Public Cultivates a Love of Reading</p>
<p>Instructions for Checking the Catalog</p>
<p>To find the books you need, you can consult the catalog. Some catalogs are in book form, and some are in card form. The card catalog of New Asia has been locked away with the reading room and can only be consulted through the book catalog. Therefore, it has been revised several times, and new books have been added. Although Hongying has catalogs of books and magazines, and Mingfu has catalogs of Western books, they have not been maintained for many years because of the assistance of cards, and many book titles are not included. Therefore, it is advisable to consult the card catalog. The cards are divided into three types: classification cards, title cards, and author cards. When consulting, you only need to check one of the categories, titles, or authors to find it. However, the card catalogs of several major libraries are often not very complete. The Chinese book card catalog of the Public Works Department and the magazine type card catalog of Hongying often have omissions, and Zhen Dan has no author card. The same is true for the series collection of Hongying. Moreover, in the series collection, if two books are bound together, the subsequent cards are often missing, so you must check the original catalog. These are all things that newcomers should pay attention to. The method of checking cards is the same as checking a dictionary, mostly classified by stroke count, which is very easy. However, words such as "增廣" (enlarged) and "最新" (latest) should be omitted from Chinese book titles, and "The" should be omitted from English book titles.</p>
<p>Whether flipping through the catalog or entering the book depository, it is not so easy to find. Here, you must know some of the ways of the library. Books are arranged according to book codes, which are composed of classification codes, title codes, and author codes. The book codes currently commonly used are based on the Dewey Decimal Classification, which uses the ten digits 0 to 9 to represent ten categories: philosophy, religion, society, language, natural science, applied science (including agriculture, medicine, and domestic affairs), art, and literature, with history at the end. The arrangement of these nine categories of knowledge roughly follows a natural order, so it is easy to remember with a little attention. Everything outside of these nine categories is classified as 0 and placed before 1, called general works. The study of books and series is included in this general category. As for the further division of these ten categories into subcategories, all the way down to decimals, it has become a large book, and its complexity can be imagined. However, we only need to know the general outline to facilitate a lot.</p>
<p>The author code for Chinese books commonly uses the Wang Yunwu Four-Corner Numeral System, which is arranged according to the first character of the author's name. For the second code of English books, the first letter is the capital letter of the author's first name, and the following Arabic numerals are the numerical code based on the letters of the name. The last letter is the first letter of the book title. Therefore, to find a book written by someone, just find the part of that category with the first letter of the person's name.</p>
<p>To find the articles you need in periodicals, you must have an index. Since the Hongying Library is known for its collection of periodicals, its journal index is very useful. However, the humanities magazine index (the library was formerly named "Humanities" and published the Humanities Magazine) used before was published in installments, piecemeal, which was not easy to check. It is best to check the library's cards. All the articles on the cards are from magazines collected by the library. In addition, other major libraries in other cities have compiled indexes, such as the Lingnan Chinese Magazine Index, the Beiping National Studies Paper Index, and specialized indexes such as agricultural science papers, geographical science papers, Kunming papers, literary papers, psychological papers, and even Qing Dynasty documents. Other magazines such as Science Education have specialized indexes, and some also attach a summary (abstract) of the articles in the index. Daxia used to have summaries of historical papers, but others seem to be unseen.</p>
<p>Borrowing Procedures</p>
<p>After checking the book title in the catalog, you can write it on the borrowing slip. The number must be copied exactly, otherwise, you will often not be able to borrow it. People who borrow books for the first time often do not pay attention to these things, so they feel a lot of trouble. In fact, after understanding the meaning of the number, it is not easy to make mistakes when writing it.</p>
<p>Each time you can borrow about two or three books. Each library is slightly different. Some places have restrictions, and some places do not.</p>
<p>Among the six libraries, the books of Hongying, Customs, and Mingfu cannot be borrowed outside the library and can only be read in the library. However, the Mingfu Library is intended for members of the China Science Society. For individuals or organizations that donate more than 500 yuan, a full-year borrowing card is given, but ordinary people cannot borrow it. Borrowing books from Zhen Dan requires a temporary deposit. Chinese books are ten yuan, and Western books are twenty yuan, and it is limited to single copies, not including series. Most of the books in New Asia are very expensive. If the price is high, it depends on how much the price exceeds the deposit. Because of the early or late addition, the deposit for the library card of the library ranges from two yuan to five yuan, and then changed to five yuan in new currency. There are many levels in between, so the amount of the temporary deposit is also different. All the books of the Public Works Department can be borrowed except for reference books and series. Because the school or shop has already provided a guarantee when entering the library, there is no other deposit. (To be continued) (Note: This manuscript was written by Mr. Li Mangren. The first article was mistakenly signed "劍" (sword), which is specially corrected.)</p>

<h3>Another Grand Football Match is Being Promoted This Weekend or May Be Realized The Baojia Self-Defense Match Urges the Baojia Side to Pay the Ticket Money</h3>
<p>The Baojia and Self-Defense Cup, two major football tournaments organized by the Baojia Guidance Committee of the Public Concession of this city, have been successfully concluded. The accounts of the expenses related to the football matches are being settled. According to the person in charge of the committee yesterday, the holding of the Baojia and Self-Defense Cup was enthusiastically sponsored and actively supported by all sectors, which is very grateful. The ticket revenue was excellent and broke the record of charity matches held for public welfare or charitable causes. However, the promotion of tickets this time, in addition to pre-sales and door sales, honorary tickets and special tickets, which were automatically recognized or enthusiastically promoted by various committees, as of now, ordinary tickets are only for door sales and pre-sales, so the numbers can be concluded. The other two items still have a small part of the ticket money that has not been paid, and the total amount of tickets and football auctions is estimated to be around 250,000 yuan. In order to speed up the ending, the committee once again urges all parties to remit the ticket money to the committee at 200 Fuzhou Road within three days as soon as possible, or call 10145 to notify, and personnel can be sent to collect it. It is also learned that the permanent director of the Baojia Guidance Department, Cheng Zhiliang, Xu Xiangsheng, and Wang Ruilong, have been promoting another grand match, and the target of the team and the venue are being negotiated. If it goes smoothly, it can be realized at the end of this week.</p>

All newspaper stands, bookstores, and sports equipment companies have it for sale, and each copy costs 2.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Holding Crabs and Appreciating Chrysanthemums</h3>
<p>Crabs are an unfortunate species of shellfish. They have a false appearance, claiming to be "armored generals," but they are "gutless wonders." Wearing a suit of armor, they intended to roam the rivers and seas. Humans are clever after all, catering to their preferences, building crab houses, and luring them with lights. So, in groups, they throw themselves into the trap. These days, chrysanthemums are yellow beside the fence, and crabs are also on the market. I can't help but make a random chatter, just to suit the season.</p>
<p>The producing areas of crabs can be roughly divided into ocean, Yangtze River, and inland river. Seawater is salty, and the crabs produced are strange-looking, some as big as stone drums, or with a pair of giant claws, shaped like magic hands. The meat is old and the taste is inferior, and those who are not exceptionally stomach-endowed would not bother to ask about them. The Yangtze River has lively and clear water, producing a large number of crabs, which are also delicious. However, what Shanghainese value is in the inland river, which actually refers to the Taihu Lake basin, which is what is called "Dazha crabs". And those produced in Yangcheng Lake are even more rare, and their reputation can be compared with the Yellow River carp in Fenlingdu, Henan; the four-gilled perch under the Xiuyabridge in Songjiang; and the red-scaled shad near the Diaoyutai in Fuchun River. It is said that the spirit of heaven and earth is concentrated there, with unique characteristics: green shell, white belly, golden claws, yellow hair, full of fat and fleshy, unparalleled in freshness. There is even a story of deifying them, with a deep "王" (king) character on their backs, crawling on glass, with eight feet propping up, and the navel hanging in the air, which is indeed different from ordinary products. Therefore, crab vendors all use "Yangcheng Lake" as a slogan, and Shanghainese eat crabs, and they must be "Yangcheng Lake"! However, according to the investigation, Yangcheng Lake does not produce many crabs. Even in a big year, it is only 800 to 1,000 dans, which are distributed to various places on the Beijing-Shanghai line. How many can Shanghai get? How can enough satisfy the gluttons? Let's not worry about it for now. Anyway, eating the reputation is also a happy thing.</p>
<p>At the turn of autumn and winter, the big wharves in Nanshi, the 16th Pier, the Hongkou Touba, and the old Zhage Bridge along the bank are particularly tense. Because the Yangtze River boats, Su, Xi, Kun, Tai, Hang, Jia, Song, and Hu boats, must have crabs from various producing areas brought in. The crab vendors have been waiting for a long time. Once the goods arrive, they swarm up to select the goods they need. After the silver and the goods are exchanged, they choose the size, match the male and female, and place them in iron cages, displayed on the street for the public to buy.</p>
<p>In addition to the small vegetable markets, the lively road intersections, and the entrances of restaurants and taverns, all are concentrated places for crab stalls. Among them, the Risheng Building area is particularly large, from the Ciro's department store north to Beijing Road. The sidewalks and entrances on both sides are all occupied, forming a crab kingdom. Since there are many in the same industry, competition is inevitable. Some use neon tubes for advertising; some use loud voices to solicit customers. In addition to generally referring to the genuine Yangcheng Lake clear water crabs, there are also those who use "Crab King" as the standard. The so-called Crab King, each weighing seven or eight taels, is priced at CRB 20 yuan each. Cantonese restaurants, which are particular about decoration, have always been reluctant to let others. At this time, they are even more serious and choose one or two big crabs, and temporarily ask the tropical fish to move out of the house and keep them in glass tanks to attract diners.</p>
<p>The method of cooking crabs has greatly improved in recent years. In the past, they were boiled in water. The crabs could not stand the heat in the wok and would inevitably turn and scramble, causing the fat to scatter, and the meat to become old and tasteless. Ten years ago, Gao Chang and his partner invented the tying and cooking method on Fourth Malu. Before putting them in the water, they were tied with colorful ropes to make them unable to move, just like dealing with a cut criminal. This method spread and became very popular, but it is still not perfect. Because when boiled in water, the fresh taste will eventually overflow and seep into the soup. So, more improvements have been made, forming today's most sophisticated steaming and charcoal grilling methods. And charcoal grilling can be called the only major invention in the 20th-century Oriental diet. The cooked crabs are fresh, tender, and full of fat, and the color, aroma, and taste are all excellent.</p>
<p>The art of eating, progressing from barbarism to civilization, is a natural process. But in extreme civilization, with a slightly barbaric way, the original flavor, is often unique. Beggar's chicken is suddenly appreciated by the literati. When eating roasted mutton in the north, you must hold a glass of white wine in one hand and put one leg on the stool to taste good. The twelve beauties in the Grand View Garden are tired of tasting delicacies, so they secretly get a piece of venison, cook it randomly, and everyone fights for it, happy and excited. It seems that at that time, there was also a black market for pork in Nanjing. The way of eating crabs is undoubtedly more barbaric, and the fun is in the barbarism.</p>
<p>There is a common saying that "beggars eat dead crabs, every one is good." It can be seen that eating crabs has a style. The most elegant thing is to hold a crab and appreciate chrysanthemums at the same time. Before the war, Xiaoguan Garden in Jiangwan, the Municipal Agricultural Ground in Pudong, and the Guanshengyuan Agricultural Ground in Caohejing were all famous for cultivating chrysanthemums, with a rich variety of good varieties. Every year on this day, a chrysanthemum exhibition must be held for people to admire. If you are familiar with the garden owner, or introduce yourself through acquaintances, you can also bring wine and crabs to enjoy the flowers and hold a banquet on the spot. Guanshengyuan Agricultural Ground even thinks of customers and has a catering department, which specially sends people to purchase Yangcheng Lake crabs and sell them on the spot. This kind of heroic victory has become a thing of the past and is nowhere to be found. The reporter thinks that holding crabs and appreciating chrysanthemums is certainly a good fun, but it is not necessary to force them into one thing. Shanghai has too many people who are fond of elegance, as if appreciating chrysanthemums is not pleasant without holding crabs; and holding crabs is not elegant without appreciating chrysanthemums. The annual chrysanthemum meeting in the brothel is hailed as a grand event, and the branches and trunks of chrysanthemums are forcibly bent and tied into a dipper of pearls and baby's breath, which is vulgar enough, and then piled up into a mountain. Wine and flower stands, a group of vulgar bones, after being drunk and full, casually eat a few crab cavities, and if this is called elegant, it is really dare not flatter! (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Public Bonds are Tired of Thinking About Revival</h3>
<p>The public bond grey market rebounded slightly yesterday, but the big drop and small rebound did not show stability. However, speculators only did temporary speculative transactions, and short sellers also made up for it, resulting in a rebound of one yuan and several angles in the market. The trend may lead to a situation of suppressing first and then raising. The market was still weak at the opening, and both Ding and Wu types were within 50 yuan. The use of Type B was also smaller than the previous day. After rising, it fell back to below the previous day's price. At the close, the bulls tried their best to pull it up, and it rebounded slightly. In terms of news, it is still a consistent policy to consider anything above 50 yuan as illegal. However, if it falls to the 50 yuan level, there may be a longer period of hovering. That is, when the Public Enterprise Exchange opens in the future, the authorities will not open it especially above 50 yuan. This is the crux of the public bond market price, and the reason for the rise and fall. Originally, it was above par, and this newspaper had already stated it in advance, but the general public was still obsessed and did not pay attention to it. As a result, the market price rose by one yuan to two yuan across the board, and there were very few 96 transactions. The only exception was a rise of 3.1 yuan, which was the most. The total transaction volume was about 3 million yuan. The summary table is listed below:</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Rise and Fall Unevenly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market rose first and then fell back, which was due to the actual goods being sold high. However, several old stocks are still progressing upward. Yongxiang Printing and Minyi Pharmaceutical have the right to recognize the new shares of Sanle Industrial, and investment is still strong. Other stocks eventually rose and fell unevenly. The textile industry was the weakest. Yongan Textile only opened at 1,856 yuan, a small drop of 60 yuan. Meilun Woolen, Shanghai Cotton Weaving, and Dazhonghua Weaving all rebounded by a small amount of 0.5 to 2.5 jiao. In the department store industry, Yongan and Guohuo rose by one yuan each, and Xinxin fell to 139.5 yuan. Underwear fell by 0.5 jiao. In the new pharmaceutical industry, Minyi saw 94.5 yuan and rose by 2 yuan again. Zhongfa and Xinya each fell by about 2 yuan. Star Perfume rose by 7.5 yuan to 255 yuan. In cultural stocks, Commercial Press rose by another 10 yuan, and Zhonghua rose by 0.5 jiao. The world has rebounded by a small amount of 5.5 yuan. Yongxiang was a blockbuster, appearing at a high price of 30 yuan, and then at 28 yuan, a huge rise of 13 yuan. Nanyang Yan Cao rose to 112.5 yuan, and Dazhonghua Matches was 268 yuan, and the trend has stabilized. In the public utility industry, Zhabei Water and Electricity rose by 0.5 jiao, and Huashang Electric was flat. Daxin Electrical Appliances, a large household, saw a high price of 17.5 yuan yesterday, Vita Wealth is still around 25 yuan, and Gongli Bus and Xinhua Lacquer are firm, and the transaction is normal. The market price list for today is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Jewelry Gold Unchanged</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold shops in this city and the Da Xin industry issued a price of 2,550 yuan per tael of jewelry gold (about 300 yuan less for purchases), which has not changed. The inter-industry price has little change. It was initially 2,310 yuan, and then it rose slightly to 1,2315 yuan, and then fell back. At noon, it was 2,310 yuan, the same as the previous day. The transaction was sparse, and the final price was 2,320 yuan, which was quite high. As for jewelry and patterned silver, it was still 14 yuan per tael, which has not changed. The inter-industry price was 12.35 yuan for supply and demand. Yesterday, the Qianye Gonghui's discount rate changed little and remained at 1.4 jiao.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market, the Japanese military ticket trended flat, and the inter-industry price was 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen and 57 li. The silver shop and the small money shop sold it at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 6 fen and 6.5 fen, and bought it at about 5 fen.</p>
<h3>Cloth Still Tight</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth The market rose again yesterday, and the goods continued to be tight. 16-pound Earth coarse cloth was 225 yuan, the same pound of Feihong was 31 yuan, 9-pound Xinzi was 125 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong was 122 yuan, 12-pound Earth fine cloth was 184 yuan at noon, and the afternoon market needed 186 yuan. Dapeng Fugui Xin Dan shouted at 183 yuan to 4 yuan, and the bank order was 177 yuan, and someone wanted it. Taohua Nvshi Lin received the price at 270.5 yuan in the afternoon, and 274.75 yuan was traded, and Chuji Shilin was 265 yuan, and An An Lan was 210 yuan in dark color, all with demand and no supply.</p>
<p>Dong Cloth The price rose after the initial flat, and the prices rose. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth Xinxin Dan was 193 yuan to 4.5 yuan, the bank order was 185.25 yuan, and Caiqiu was 185.5 yuan, all short of supply. Sijunzi Serge Hong Dan was 7 yuan, 3 jiao, 78 points, and rose to 7 yuan, 4 jiao, 56 points. After the noon closing, the fine yarn was reported to rise to 7 yuan, 5 jiao, 34 points, and there was still demand.</p>
<h3>Bean Cake Sales are Strong</h3>
<p>In the miscellaneous grain market, the arrival of goods was still sparse yesterday, and only bean cakes were traded. The market situation was trending strong. It is estimated that 500 pieces of Kai Changji bean cakes were priced at 73 yuan, and 1,000 pieces were delivered in two weeks at 73.5 yuan. One cart of Yuanlong bean cakes was priced at 74 yuan, and three carts of Fei Zi bean cakes were priced at 75 yuan to 76 yuan.</p>
<h3>Commercial Briefs</h3>
<p>Soft Cakes are Tight The previous batch of arrivals has been almost sold out. According to the customer's telegram, several dozen pieces of the next batch are being shipped and are on the way to Shanghai. The cost must be at least 100 yards more than before. If the cake blank is soft and glutinous and bright in color, it will definitely continue to rise. Jinshan branches are slightly loose and cheap, and the market has returned to flat due to the slightly sluggish sales. Yesterday, I heard that the number was more than 200 pieces, slightly lower than before, and the goods fluctuated slightly, with a difference of 20 yards high and low, which was immediately opened. However, the production price is still hard, and the source is not easy. There is no hope of excessive loosening in the future.</p>
<p>Medium-Grained Ganbei is Flat The market sells for 5,100 to 200 yuan. Triangular Ganbei is in short supply. I heard that the consortium has already transported a batch, but it has not yet been opened.</p>
<p>Daily Necessities Have Less Supply Than Demand In the daily necessities market, such as the dwindling inventory of soap, the owners are trying harder to thicken the bottom, creating a situation where there is less supply than demand, causing the price to rise higher and higher. Gu Ben soap has risen to 375 yuan, Bai Xiangmao is 320 yuan, Huang Xiangmao is 280 yuan, and Scissors soap is 330 yuan, which is 5 to 10 yuan higher than before. Matches are temporarily stable, with Meili at 2,550 yuan, Phoenix at 2,350 yuan, Jindin at 2,250 yuan, and miscellaneous brands at 1,850 yuan, with no honor or disgrace. The candle market is still popular, with White Reeve's Ship Brand reaching 180 yuan, Hump Cap Brand at 155 yuan, and miscellaneous brands at 130 yuan. The pharmaceutical market has a strong underlying trend, which is generally caused by hoarders. There are also rumors of gossip Dan's chemical reproduction and various profitable purchases, so those who hold the goods are even more profitable, and the price is rising daily. Bagua Dan is priced at 26 yuan, Mentholatum is 30 yuan, and headache powder is 25.5 jiao, all priced per dozen. Crane Vegetable is 58 yuan, Longhu Rendan is 24 yuan, and Invincible Tooth Powder is 9.5 jiao, and the selling prices are all trending upward.</p>

<h3>On Li Yuzhi's Future</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>Li Yuzhi is one of the four famous female Dan performers from the Beiping Opera School. The fourth class of the Beiping Opera School was known for its "Jade" (玉) designation, with the female roles each named after beautiful flowers and fragrant herbs. Among them, the "Four Jades" were particularly prominent: Hou Yulan, Li Yuru, Bai Yuwei, and Li Yuzhi. The first three Jades had already come to Shanghai in succession, leaving with great acclaim, with Li Yuzhi being the last to arrive. Some wondered why Yuzhi was so late in coming. There is a reason for this: Yuzhi is the youngest. The arrival of the Four Jades in the South resembles a kind of "marriage," with the order of marriage following the rule of "eldest first, then youngest." The younger ones usually wait until their older sisters have achieved success before becoming brides themselves. This is an ancient custom, and deviating from this order would not be appropriate. Examining common principles, among many sisters, the youngest is often the most intelligent and favored. Yang Guifei's sisters, the Duchess of Qin and the Second Duchess, were undoubtedly beautiful, but still paled in comparison to Guifei. Furthermore, consider the drama of Wang Baochuan. The two older sisters, Jin Chuan and Yin Chuan, were less intelligent and capable than the third sister, and their fame was also less. This is irrefutable proof that, although the Four Jades are not blood sisters, the precedent might be similar. It is also rumored that Yuzhi was ill for over a year, which was a major reason for her inability to seek opportunities in the South earlier.</p>
<p>Although I have seen few of Yuzhi's performances, I can predict that her future holds even greater promise than the other three Jades. Why do I say this? I observe that she is more intelligent and capable of playing both Qingyi and Huadan roles. Her voice, singing, appearance, and stage skills are all above average. In today's opera world, a performer must be able to play three types of roles to satisfy the audience's demands. For example, a Dan role should be proficient in Qingyi, Huadan, and Daoma (female warrior) techniques, and possess excellent voice, appearance, and martial skills to be considered a "complete" performer. However, it is difficult to excel in all three. A Qingyi role who can also perform Huadan roles with flair can also become very popular. Simply focusing on Qingyi roles is often not well-received by the public. Yuzhi excels in Qingyi singing and is also skilled in various Huadan roles. I see her eyes sparkle with spirit, and she has dimples on her cheeks. Every time she smiles, she is exceptionally beautiful. Her figure is petite and suitable for agile movements. In plays like "Mei Long Zhen" and "Wen Zhang Hui," she is confident and certain to succeed. She is truly a budding Huadan talent. The other three Jades either excel in Qingyi but are unsuitable for Huadan roles, or are only good at Huadan roles with poor singing and voice. They have still gained fame and recognition. Considering this, how can Yuzhi's future be measured?</p>
<h3>Opera World News</h3>
<p>The Gengxin Stage has already engaged Tong Zhiling, Chi Shigong, and Yan Shishan to succeed Li Zongyi, Li Yuzhi, and Li Duokui. As for the existing supporting actors, such as Fu Dewei, Guan Dexian, Ci Shaoquan, Wang Yurang, Yin Jinzhen, and Gao Desong, they will all be retained. However, the young male actor Zhou Weijun will be replaced by Jiang Shiyu because Zhou has other engagements in Beiping and cannot stay in Shanghai for long.</p>
<p>The Tianchan Stage has recently engaged Yang Baosen and Zheng Bingru. Yang and Zheng have agreed to collaborate without prioritizing each other. The playbills will be printed with both names equally to show their partnership. Yesterday, Bingru sent a letter stating that the agreement has been finalized, and the payment has been received. She will arrive by plane around the 6th of this month, with her stage debut expected around the 10th.</p>
<p>Huangjin, Wu Suqiu, and Ye Shengzhang will perform until the 6th of this month and will not continue their engagement. Starting from the 7th, the FULIANCHENG Little Class will take over the evening performances. As for Cheng Yanqiu's Qiu Sheng Society, they have decided to start performing on the evening of the 11th. The leading actor, Guan Shengxi, and the supporting cast are expected to arrive in the South by train in the next few days and should reach Shanghai soon.</p>
<p>After leaving Shanghai, Wu Suqiu will first go to Tianjin to perform short plays at the invitation of the China Grand Theatre. The young male actor Yu Zhenfei will accompany her. It is rumored that Yu's decision to join Wu's troupe was facilitated by Zhu Fuchang, the president of the Beiping Drama Newspaper, with a monthly salary of approximately six thousand yuan from the Federal Reserve. Song Baoluo and Song Ziping are performing at the Kaiming Grand Theatre in Suzhou. Their engagement has been extended repeatedly, and ticket sales remain strong. After repeated requests, they have agreed to extend their performances for another ten days, until the 10th of this month. They will then lead their troupe back north, with one report suggesting they will perform short plays in Ningbo.</p>
<h3>Li Jianwu's "Yun Caixia" Premieres</h3>
<p>— Yi Xiang</p>
<p>Xia Xia's Last Performance Before Leaving Shanghai; Gu Degang Makes a Comeback to Co-star</p>
<p>The Shanghai theater scene is gradually forming a three-way split. "Shangyi" is stationed at the Carlton, establishing its resurgence with the "Great Circus." The "Zhongzhong" Theater relies on its internal resources at the Lihua, hiring Wu Renzhi and others to strengthen its efforts. The "Lyceum" will be staging performances by the emerging Yiguang Theater Company starting on October 6th. "Yiguang" is a transformation of "Huayi," but with the addition of Xia Xia, Gu Degang, Lin Bin, and others, its momentum is strong. The first play is Li Jianwu's "Yun Caixia," directed by Zhu Ruijun.</p>
<p>"Yun Caixia" is a five-act tragicomedy set against the backdrop of the life of a renowned female opera star. It also depicts the patrons of wealthy gentlemen and the backstage life of Peking Opera troupes. It reminds one of the novel "Qiu Haitang," which was also very popular. "Yun Caixia" not only shares similarities with "Qiu Haitang" but also has many intricate plots and moving stories, which are rare in recent plays. The cast includes Xia Xia, Gai Lan, Huang Zongjiang, Huang Zongying, Jiang Tianliu, and Wang Qi, among others. There is also exciting news that Gu Degang, the leading actor who won widespread support when the Shanghai Drama Society established itself with "Ren Zhi Chu," has joined as a guest performer after being away from the stage for three years. This will undoubtedly add much to "Yun Caixia."</p>
<p>Xia Xia has decided to take a trip in the near future, around this month. It is likely that she will not return to Shanghai for a while. "Yun Caixia" is her last performance before leaving Shanghai. Audiences who enjoy Xia Xia's acting will surely want to see her work one more time.</p>
<h3>Anti-Tuberculosis Film Exhibition Opens Tomorrow</h3>
<p>— Liang</p>
<p>The film industry, which has been silent for a long time, will be fully active again starting tomorrow. The Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Movement Committee's exhibition of famous photographic works will be opened by Dr. Mei Lanfang and twenty famous socialites, ushering in the event for the city's residents.</p>
<p>The new building at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Dahua Road is truly ideal for photographic exhibitions! All nine rooms on the three floors are filled with approximately three hundred photographs of various sizes. The most outstanding are the more than sixty masterpieces by renowned photographer Lang Jingshan. The stunning scenery and delicate portraits showcase the rapid progress of modern photographic art. They bring people ideals and inspiration, deeply permeating the comprehensive expression of truth, goodness, and beauty. Works by Lu Shifu, Chen Chuanlin, Hu Boxiang, and others can also be described as artistic crystallizations, with each facet reflecting human intelligence, wisdom, and skill. The exhibition will last for about ten days. Although it is not "free of charge," those who know its content and see it with their own eyes believe that spending a few yuan on tickets and two or three hours immersing themselves in the appreciation of art, indirectly helping impoverished tuberculosis patients, is a very worthwhile endeavor with multiple benefits.</p>
<h3>Wang Xichun Returns to the Silver Screen</h3>
<p>While the China Film Studio was being reorganized, Wang Xichun did not join due to being in the early stages of her marriage. However, both the studio and countless fans hoped that Wang Xichun would continue to work under the spotlight. Now, that wish has finally come true. Wang Xichun has officially signed a special contract with the China Film Studio under strong public support. Her first film has also been decided upon: "Meiniang Ballad," directed by Tu Guangqi. Isn't "Meiniang Ballad" supposed to star Chen Yanyan? Why is it being reassigned? There is a reason for that. From "Madame Butterfly" to "Fanhua Xudu," Chen Yanyan has starred in several tragedies. The content of "Meiniang Ballad" is also filled with suffering and despair. Therefore, Chen Yanyan requested the company to allow her to act in some comedies. Coincidentally, Wang Xichun joined the studio, so "Meiniang Ballad" will mark Wang Xichun's return to the silver screen. The other actors, such as Yan Jun and Zhang Wan, will remain the same.</p>
<h3>Mei Shou</h3>
<p>— Xiao</p>
<p>Dr. Mei Lanfang celebrated his 49th birthday at his private residence the day before yesterday. People from the opera world, including Cheng Yanqiu and dozens of relatives and friends, went to offer their congratulations. However, there were few foreign guests, as Mei did not want to make a lavish display due to the changing times. Furthermore, he has been suffering from a severe cold and has been responding to external engagements less often. Rumors that he has shaved off his short beard are not true.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(10) Feilai Peak</p>
<p>Wei Cheng took down his father's portrait from the wall. His father's portrait had been hanging for longer than his mother's. The nails were rusty, and the rope was frayed. The dust on the rope and frame was also thicker. Just as Wei Cheng lifted the frame, "clatter" it fell to the ground. He couldn't even catch it in time. He hurriedly followed the frame down, picked it up, and placed it back on the table. But the glass had shattered into seven or eight pieces, and some had fallen out of the frame. Wei Cheng opened his mouth, filled with indescribable shame. He thought that there were several other frames at home and wondered if the sizes would match the photo. He turned the frame over, removed a piece of the backing, and wanted to take out his father's portrait to reframe it. But an astounding discovery was made at that moment.</p>
<p>Between the backing and the photo was a half-length portrait of a man, either four or six inches in size. Having ten of these photos would not be unusual, but what was strange was the inscription next to the photo. On the right were the words "To Madam Huifen for her safekeeping," and on the left were the words "From Cheng Bingjin." The sight of the names Huifen and Cheng Bing entered his mind, and he couldn't help but be surprised, so surprised that he almost became paralyzed. Huifen was the name of the eldest Mrs. Ye, and Cheng Bing was the enemy with whom he had a vendetta for his father's death. How could he not be surprised? He suddenly walked to the door and closed both panels, then returned to the table, picked up the photo, and examined it carefully. He looked to see if the character Bingjin was correct, and there was no mistake. Then he looked at the person in the photo, Cheng Bing, who had a square face and large ears and was between twenty and thirty years old. He held the photo in his left hand and clenched his right fist, trying to hit Cheng Bing's face. He gritted his teeth so hard that they creaked. If fire could truly come out of one's eyes, his would have already been blazing. His heart was pounding in his chest. He beat his fist against his chest, wanting to exhale, but he was so suffocated that he couldn't. When he looked again, Cheng Bing's face seemed familiar, but he couldn't remember where he had seen it before. He put the photo on the table, held his head, and thought for a moment. He walked back and forth in the room, looking at the photo, and finally, he remembered. (220)</p>
