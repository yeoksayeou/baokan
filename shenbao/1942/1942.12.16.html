<p>社評</p>
<h3>重慶政權西北「中央北」的困難</h3>
<p>渝府目前繼續堅持拖戰的政策，除了對外更澈底地依存英美，敷衍蘇聯之外，對內便有近來「甚囂塵上」的西北「中央化」運動。爲什麽要實行西北「中央化」政策呢？首先是因爲大東亞戰爭爆發以後，西南的國際通路已被封鎖，萬卞屬目的滇緬路，已變成日本軍隊的進兵路綫了；於是渝方的目光，遂移注到西北的交通和資源開發方面。其次是中日事變以來五年間，中共及其軍隊的勢力日漸擴充，這使渝府感到最大的不安。便想利用所謂戰略的相持階段的空隙，從軍事政治尤其是經濟方面，來把西北爭到渝府的掌握。在這兩大目標之下，西北「中央化」的口號一時響入雲霄。不過所謂西北「中央化」政策的內容，至少在目前還只限於經濟上的，所以我們且從這一方面稍加硏究，看它有什麼前途。</p>
<p>事變以來，渝方的經濟困難，始終是最嚴重的困難。首先是對英美依存關係的增加，失去了「自力更生」的基礎，一切經濟政策失去自主性。其次是工業分佈的不平衡，以內遷工廠論，六百三十九家內遷工廠，遷往西北的僅有二十七家，其餘都集中在西南地區，尤以遷居四川者爲最多。以發展悄形說，西南方面先後成立的有一千三百餘家，而西北僅有七十三家。而且西北的各種工業，百分之八十都集中在陜西少數大城市，甘肅方面僅只略具規模，說得上新工業的，不過百分之二三。這種不合理的現象，不僅影響到國民經濟生活的調整，而且父影響到對內對外物資的政策，形成年來渝方物資恐慌，戰鬥力薄弱的主要根原。（參閱本月八·九兩日本報澳門通信重慶物資缺乏之現狀）這種現象，是比政治上甚至軍事上的困難更使渝方苦悶的。大東亞戰爭以後，渝方這種苦悶更爲增加，於是始有改變工業建設方針，建設「新西北」的口號。一方面有蔣（介石）翁（文灝）等西北之行，不斷地進行軍·政·經濟界的種種會議；另一方面又發動了「民間」的經濟活動，如「中國工程師學會」的擴大討論開發西北資源問題，「工礦調整處」與「渝市工業界」之合組「西北工業考察團」，到西北各地去專事查勘。都可以表明渝府過去對於西北的失策，及其目前西南方面的苦悶，而不得不周章地喊出了西北「中央化」的調子。</p>
<p>不過所謂西北「中央化」並不如理想的美滿，渝府已經遭遇到許多困難。</p>
<p>第一，西北在資源上，在勞力上，在資金上，雖然都存在着足够開發的條件，但是，從交通上說，從人民生活或購買力說，從動力的供給上說，從氣候上說，西北工業的開展，都不是一件容易的事，可說是困難重重。過去五六年來渝方工業徧集於西南一隅，而對於西北無人問津，正說明了西北工業化的條件太差，至少不爲一般工業界所敢輕試。渝府縱有了莫大的決心，但是牠那裏來龐大的資金，技術人才和機械工業。而且，牠是否有這耐性等待那麽一二十年之後的收穫？</p>
<p>第二，根據西南工業發展的情形，可見各工業部門的配合，是相當零亂的，而一些可獲暴利的事業，往往羣趨若鶩，以致造成某些工業部門的畸形發達。如酒精工業即是一例。從一部門說，生產欠缺調整，致有搶購原料，挖雇技工，以及製成品的粗製濫造等現象，相繼發生。如機械製造業即是一例。西南是比較最適宜於工業發展的，尚存在如此嚴重的缺陷；至於西北，更存在着許多弱點：如（一）機器銅鐵工業及動力供給的不足。（工礦業的資本總額僅五十餘萬元，機器製造業資本總額僅八八十餘萬元）。（二）交通不便。（十數里之路程，運費常爲二倍乃至七八倍於貨價）。（三）外來原料輸人不易，今後縱有中蘇路綫的暢通，但對於原料及機械的輸入，不會有多大的期待。（四）技術人才缺乏，較西南更甚。這些困雞中最主要的是第一項，由於重工業和動力沒有相當基礎，使略具規模的新工業與交通事業不能逐步展開，把整個資源開發和經濟建設政策束縛起來。</p>
<p>第三，就一般經濟界工業家的情緒來看，渝府所謂建設「新西北」，也存在着嚴重的阻礙，因爲到目前爲止，西北還是最窮苦的未開墾的處女地，而開墾這種交通不便，氣候不適，物產貧乏，人民旣愚又少的荒地，是一件最困難的事。這和投資在熟地上是不可同日而語，和投資在商業的投機上，更有天淵之別。以發慣了國難財的西南經濟界，謀求其改而從事於西北窮荒的開發，這是不可想像的。而且，渝府對於携資前往開發的廠家們，在運輸上，在資金上，在外來原料的供給上，在稅則的擔負上，在一般的政治條件上，都沒有給予他們以特別的便利，幫助，和减低其擄負，又怎能提高一般廠家對工業建設的積極性？以目前西南工業界的困苦情形看來，可以預料西南實業界對於「開發西北」，勢必裏足不前。那麼，只靠渝府一部分力量，人力財力，均有所不逮，所謂開發西北，將成空洞的口號。如果渝府在西北經濟建設上不立定基礎，那麼，所謂西北「中央化」更只成爲一句空洞的口號罷了。何况在政治上，「中央」與「地方」，「政府」與人民，還互存芥蒂，還不能和衷共濟呢？</p>
<p>西北「中央化」將成爲空洞的口號，而西南的形勢又岌岌可危，那麽，重慶政權的前途已很顯然，重慶政權下的民衆，不是到了値得認眞考慮其前途的時候了嗎？</p>

<h3>從南太平洋海戰談到明日之決戰　參加對談者　大本營海軍報道部長平出大佐</h3>
<p>— 東日編輯玉幹阿部賢</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>譯自十二月十三日「星期每日」</p>
<p>·數字是不可信的·</p>
<p>平出　相信數字的人固然有，但是，看到這次海戰中日美兵力的懸殊，反而相信英美必亡，抱那樣極端樂觀的念頭的人也不是絕無。我倒覺得，大部分人現在都是那樣想的。就事實而論，現在比起戰爭開初的當時來，我國不是愈益進入有利的勢態了麽？他們造多少，我們自然也非造多少不可。但數目完全相同，却是不必要的。只要傾向相同就行。對於敵人的多少，我們可以拿多少去對抗，這個絕對數我們是非保持不可的。</p>
<p>阿部　美國盛傳在製造大批的飛機，戰車，戰艦；這也許是一種宣傅，也許是哄騙國民的一種敗戰的辯解，更也許只是選舉上的一種政治的裝態。關於這點，你的意見怎樣？</p>
<p>平出　敵人是這樣大大地在宣傳着。只有數目是確實的。物資有種種不足，但是勞働者的不足，特別是熟練工的不足，是非常麻煩的。退一步言，照羅斯福的計劃即使完全行得通，那內容也是很令人懷疑的。這是羅斯福的噱頭，我們大可不必驚奇。</p>
<p>阿部　航空士，空軍人員，海軍軍人等等的養成，大概費時多少？請問。</p>
<p>平出　這點，日本和美國是有些區別的。日本這方面，現在是赤脚漢都在製造高度科學性的武器，（道一點也可說是日本人了不起的地方）這樣就非有長期的訓練不可。美國人自小就受着富有科學性的敎育，小孩子都懂得無綫電的分解結合，十四五歲就懂得汽車的分解結合，可以着手普通的修繕工作，我們和他們是不能比的呵。日本人須要多少年，並不就是說美國人也需要多少年。在他們的塲合，因爲準備敎育不同的原故，普通一些智識，短期內是可以灌輸的。然而，要成爲大艦隊的司令長官，大戰艦的艦長，却絕非一蹴可及的事。隨便什麽國家，要造成一個大尉，至少需時十年，艦長三十年，長官則四十年。無論你多麼心焦，靠短期講習要造成艦長或長官，總是不可能的。</p>
<p>阿部　那麼說來，以四三及四四年爲目標，他們也得造成大批人才才行哪！</p>
<p>平出　是的。他們非那樣做不可。但是，在那樣的短時期中，只有打敗仗的長官他們訓練得出來。現在美國所苦惱的，就是大元帥人才的缺乏。大元帥和熟練工同樣，不是短期間訓練得成的。</p>
<p>阿部　還有，軸心國海軍的携手，我覺得是非常重要的。德國雖爲陸軍國，但是他們潛艇的活動也曾相當破壞過英美的通商綫。假使日德海軍携手的話，那決不是一加一等於二，而是比二更多。日本有潛艇去訪問德國，最近德國也有許多潛艇自非洲方面東調。這是很好的事。關於海軍作戰，我是門外漢；可能的話，我希望不是潛艇，而是請雙方都製造些一萬至二萬噸的大潛水船出來。說到這裏，請問潛水船那樣的東西是有的吧？</p>
<h3>斯城南蘇軍被迫　退第二道防綫　丁莫生柯所部有被圍之虞</h3>

<h3>蔣介石視察西北　認西北為建國根據地　但地瘠民貧開發為難</h3>
<p>最近重慶來人談、蔣介石於九月間曾親赴西北各省作了一個月的視察、返抵重慶後、高唱「西北是建國的根據地、」因此、過去集中西南之視錢、漸移轉至西北、又十月五日吳敬恒報告西北考察觀感、謂開發西北、首重交通建設、尤以鐵路爲主、惟據熟悉西北情形者云、目前的西北、除新疆地富人稀外、其餘各省、大概皆是連年荒歉、人民困窮、西北的荒落、由來已久因地力太衰憊了、甘肅多有五年一收之田、甘陝的一片童禿、千里不見樹木、又西安物價跳得不成話、主要的是銀行資金作祟云、</p>

<h3>昆明物價動盪狀態　投機交易家操縱物價　取締的法令效果甚微</h3>
<p>事變以後，昆明一地，新興了不少實業，市面驟然繁榮，到了今年仰光失守，金華路斷，這兩方面又有很多官商巨賈以及賣空賣空的投機交易家遷到昆明來，當作樂園。他們不甘寂寞，運用了必勝的經營方法，造出很多光怪離奇的黑市塲。把整個昆明市塲籠軍在這些氛圍中。</p>
<p>自然，在這種狀態之下，物價愈漲愈高。平價當局，雖然召集了金融界巨頭。市商會。及同業公會的負責人，開會討論，並訂立了許多取締和遏制的法令，但祇能暫時寗靜，他們並不因當局限制而减少投機行爲，因爲假借權勢有背景的冒牌商人正多　哩！我們在後面的例子中，就可以看出個中消息了。</p>
<p>香煙價格的績漲</p>
<p>香烟有紙烟統銷處管理，向不受平價會統制。平價會開會的時候，統銷處代表答覆大家的詢問，竟說：「來源减少，供不應求，故小得不提高售價，以資限制。但漲風仍高漲不已，實出於不得已而爲之，以免私人囤購。」這一個答覆，被平價會主席給以爽直的反駁：「……紙烟統銷處是公家的，公家小平價，商人如何平，不論公私，一概要平。」接着，引起一塲熱烈緊張的辯論。</p>
<p>但辯論儘管辯論，漲價還是漲價，平一次，漲一次。尤其是禁止外國香烟入口令，以及渝筑等地漲價消息傳來以後，漲勢汹湧，更足驚人。香烟市塲的地點，是在護國門外的新市塲一角，這裏有幾百家大小烟商，收貨賣貨，轉手之烟，燜價隨即高漲。八月中，漲風最厲的時候，竟有人以小旅行車來搶收貨物，見貨即收，打開搶收貨物的新局面，新局而，做他日不堪回首的材料。</p>
<p>香烟難漲，吸者仍大有人在，暴發戶當然滿不在乎，投機者更不放在眼中，但用思想的大學敎授們，只得改吸了一元錢四支的鸚鵡牌，這種不登大雅之堂的香烟，居然成了學者們助長文思的珍品。</p>
<p>金價和處幣</p>
<p>金價的高漲，原在意料之中，但誰也想不到這樣快，金店把金價和工價混淆了起來，糊裏糊塗把價格提高，一個月內，條金自三千九百五十元漲過五千元大關。</p>
<p>外幣市塲，盧比買賣，每盾七元，漲至七元五角，銀行宣佈自八月十八日起停止兌換後，囤積者爭先拋出，錢莊也拒絕收兌，於是一時稍靜。美金賣買，則自三十二元漲至三十四元。</p>
<p>平價聲中，香烟和金價兩項，竟得逍遙法外，不受平價限制。這兩項對於一般物價高漲的刺激性，是有最大的罪狀的。</p>

<p>糧食問題諭壇</p>
<h3>糧食統制</h3>
<p>— 鐵民</p>
<p>茲就糧食之統制，略陳一得之愚，以供租界當局與政府主管糧食機關之參考。</p>
<p>（一）上海租界與四週和平區域，自英美勢力消滅之後，在政治上軍事上，幾已打成一片。則經濟與物資方面，亦可變方融通，使租界與非租界，打成一片，恢復戰前狀態。但爲防止奸商之囤積居奇，與高抬物價，則宜實施統制方法，以取締之。</p>
<p>（二）目前上海租界之食糧統制，有名無實，雖有限價，而黑市依然橫行，如米麵糖油，莫不如此。在和平區域，並無此項現象，而上海獨有者，蓋由統制方法之未能完善，與統制地區之只限於一隅故耳。</p>
<p>（三）關於糧食之統制，須租界當局與我國政府，通力合作，組成一元系統。地域要廣，規模須大，組織宜密，不可單限於上海一市，更不可祗限於租界一隅，至少要包括華中諸省。凡收買，搬運·銷售·均須登錄與許可。同時注意於糧食之增產，如此則調節有無，價格標準，皆操於統制機關，奸商之投機囤積，自無從活動矣。</p>
<p>（四）雜糧爲補助米麵之不足，勞働階級，大率恃此爲活，故尤須流通無阻，抑低價格，即販運小量米麥之小民，亦可予以寬大，實則物資一經流通，統制範圍旣經擴大，小民無利可圖，便不禁而自止矣。</p>
<p>（五）租界戶口米之配給量，必增加至一人足够十日之糧爲止，若租界當局因所藏食糧，不敷供給，則不如作罷，另圖施行大規模有系統之統制爲善也。</p>
<p>（六）現在上海四週，正在淸鄉期間，各項物資之不能圓滑流通，對於租界當局，以及我國糧食機關，自當加以原諒，惟今後急須準備，着手組織，以期糧食統制之合理化，得提早實現。</p>
<p>以上數項，祇就目前與租界之狀態而言，尚未及於全國食糧統制之大計。要而言之，筆者之要旨，首在使租界與和平區域之食糧流通，次之乃在破除租界與非租界之界限，實施大規模有組織之統制也。至於此項統制之如何組織？如何營運？一方須得友邦之協助，必要時與友邦合作。一方希望我國政府，尤其是上海市政府，計劃進行。使糧食統制，能舉其實，能得其平，俾上海市民能安居樂業，不再感受糧食之極度痛苦，於願足矣。</p>

<h3>治病不是可恥的事情</h3>
<p>— 新</p>
<p>祗要生息在這個疾病的世界，我們相信沒有一個人可以據言自己身上絕無一點毛病，也更沒有一個人可以預言自己今後永遠不會生病。現在世間的所謂健康與吾，這祗是一件相对的而不是絕對的事情。換言之，一個人或多或少輕或重地帶着一些毛病是一種常態，而一點沒有毛病或者今後絕對不會生病，却是近乎空想幻想的事情。</p>
<p>假定眼前有這麽兩個人，一個不諱自己有病，也不怕自己身上的病，公公開開地延醫診治服藥調養，另一個明明毛病很多，而偏偏要裝硬好漢，諱疾忌醫，有時候甚至於還要主張他自己的毛病是優點而不是缺點，正像阿Ｑ對於自己的癩頭一樣，乃至更進一步，主張治病是要不得的事情，那麼這兩者之中的可笑者屬於那裏一個，不是明明白白，不侍智者而自明的事嗎？</p>
<p>治病並不可恥，有病而不自覺，或者自覺而怕醫治，那倒是危險的事情，爲着民族的康健，我們希望大家有病治病，無病健身，看見別人延醫治病，而就視爲笑談，誇大其詞地向人家說：瞧，連他身上也有病啊」，那麼，他不是天上降下來的神仙，怎麼會沒有病呢？將對方看作應該一點病也沒有的神仙，那豈非欲毀之而润足以譽之，那不是和原來的企圖相反了嗎？</p>
<p>不理會自己的病而專找別人的病，這行徑不算得聰明，希望别人也和自己一樣地諱疾忌醫，乃至自己害怕治病而將別人的治病當作反襯出自己「健康」的資料，更是一種惡德……現在已經是應該淸除這種習性的時候了吧。</p>
<p>尊重別人，別人才尊重自己。</p>
<h3>讀石揮「慕容天錫七十天記」後</h3>
<p>— 南容</p>
<p>——原文載「雜誌」十二月號</p>
<p>我近來正在讀關於托爾斯泰的寫作態度之類的文章。內中提起托氏在那處女作「幼年時代」的序文上，載着關於自已修辭上的粗野和沒有技巧的說明，以爲這是因爲不用喉嚨，而用肚子唱歌的緣故。據他自己說，則從喉所發的聲音，較之腹聲，雖頗婉曲，而不感動人。腹聲却反是，粗野則有之，但澈底於人的精神。……因而抒寫之法，缺劃一，欠暢達，成佶倔云云。</p>
<p>像這類出於腹聲底創作的文章已經長久沒有讀着了。在「雜誌」十二月號裏石揮的「慕容天錫七十天記」，讀後，覺得這一個藝人用生命來演了他的戲，又用生命來爲了他的文章。有些人也許會輕視他文章中的所調缺劃一，欠暢達，成佶倔之處，但這正是他的腹聲，也就是他的生命的跳躍與透露，相反的，我們應當給予重視。</p>
<p>「雜誌」上同時有一篇叫作「天才藝人石揮」，讀了「慕容天錫七十天記」，便一定會感到，天才兩個字也許反而會把藝人咬牙苦鍊的努力輕輕地掩沒了。一個藝人的成功，我以爲天才祇好佔十分之二三，大部份要靠努力得來，我們看石揮的演技，他是怎樣用全生命的力量去搏得的啊！</p>
<p>這篇文章，大部份是演「大馬戲團」的手記，給與演員們貢獻是非常之大的。當代從事戲劇的人們以及愛好者都會得去讀了再讀，我不在這裏再多所舉出。</p>
<p>値得我們注意而成爲問題的，是那「後語」，他不僅描出「一幅藝人末路窮途的圖畫」實即是當代社會給藝人的待過問通。我記得某一個哲人說的：「給予人成功底力量的，是莫過於有計劃的志願與相當的貧困」。所以說「相當的」貧困者，因爲太順利的境遇，固然會失去天才的鍛鍊，太艱苦的生活，也一樣的會蹧蹋了天才，竟至於覆滅。</p>
<p>「又要排戲了，一個病勢未愈的身子，拖來拖去終有她停止活動的一天」。</p>
<p>在我們的社會裏，竟會看着一個眞正的藝人發出這樣絕望的叫喊而仟其自然的毀滅嗎？</p>
<p>受生活的不宰和種種的迫害，好像是嚴肅的藝術家常會遭遇的事，這在歷史上也成爲定例似的。莫非是由於藝術家的對於藝術底嚴肅，忠實，做一個像樣的人，不會鑽營，現世就很難給他優裕的待遇了。</p>
<p>石揮有了這種才能，他雖然在文字裏也發着自憐自傷的話，但也並不是非活不可的十分經心於自己的死亡，他是非常强硬的，他謙虛地說：「我不懂政治，也不了解經濟」，但他在「總之，當前的社會問題不解決，像我這樣普遍的現象是永遠存在的」這結語裏分明　指出他自己的命運，並且指出的不僅是他個人，他是和普遍的人一樣的命運。他對這社會，經濟，個人和人們的問題實在深深的思索過。我現在要把打爾斯泰所說的「澈底於人的精神」奉給他，這也就是他的藝術所以有今日這樣成就的胎產所在。這個，大概讀者不會覺得我言之太過罷？</p>
<p>「人們都去追尋他們自己的溫暖，誰來管你這一片枯黃破碎的落葉？這是他暈倒後第三天的夜裏獨自在風雨街頭發出來的悲歎。今日的人間竟冷酷到道樣麽？我慚愧地寫下這一篇小文，算是我送給這位藝人的一點暖意。</p>

<p>當我們剛得到工作時，一顆純潔的心，欣慰異常，以　如今可以用勞力來解決困苦的生活了。可是待上班時，上司命令我們的臉部須用脂粉來塗搽，服裝是當局以　價定製的艷麗的衣衫。我們失去了樸實的內心，和天眞無邪的顏容。他們要我們裝出嫵媚的笑容。可是那種不自然的微笑，實在是怪可憐的，同時也掩飾不了我們內心的悲哀。我們大多數需要負擔一家的生計，因家人的失業，才由我們來走進此深淵。但幾百元一月的收入，在此生活費用日益飛漲的時期中，用來維持一家的開支，已很拮据，何况又得買豪華的消耗品，脂粉，物飾等來裝點門面。這樣一天十三小時的辛勞，溫飽尚可勉强，但物質的享受是談小到的，而精神上的創傷却也很深。我們受盡了侮辱與譏嘲，絲毫得不到同情與撫慰。如果遇到吃人膏血的人」，他們會作出無禮貌的輕狂動作，倘有怠慢，將遭辱駡，同時上司又要加你以服務不週的罪名，說不定會打破飯碗。同是人類，我們爲何該挨受這一切冷酷的待遇？我們還被人家取了一個「玻璃杯』的雅號，他們以爲我們女招待不是潔白的女性。但是我們一顆至誠求上進的赤心，是無論如何毀滅不掉的。我們利用　餘的僅有時間，不斷地學習。我們雖被生活剝尊了靑年應享受的求學權利，可是我們決意奮鬬，我們不與惡劣的環境妥協。在這盪動的大時代裏，應該拿出勇氣來，迎接當頭大難。暫時的受挫，是不足爲奇的。我們暫時雖是一般社會人士所鄙視的！羣，可是我們相信將來必定有揚眉吐氣，大家平等的一天。我們雖過着凄楚的生活，到人靜夜深時，擁衾而泣，但我們並不絕望，我們不能做一輩子的奴隸。我們要從生活中學習，不斷地學習。我們雖爲下層職業者，却不存自私心。不比　般衣冠楚楚的僞君子，絲毫沒有同情心。在惟利是圖以後，就是揮金如土，作威作福，在我們面前賣弄。可是我們不願接受非善意的饋贈，同時謝絕不勞而獲。我們要努力掙脫生活的枷鎖，追求光明的新生！</p>

<p>陳老太太躺在藤椅上，哭的出聲了。維城和黃龍都愕然，道：「怎麽的是誰過去了？」維城問老媽子，老媽子一方面伺候她的老太太，一方面說，我們老爺是某月某日壽終滬寓了。</p>
<p>陳老太太聽了談論程家的事，會想到自己兒子的死；維城和黃龍看了陳老太太的掉淚，就立即想到陳老太太的兒子是誰，這僑人怎麽可以死？仰們陪了陳老太太悽然，屋子裏頓時變成寂靜。在寂靜之中，陳老太太帶着嗚咽的聲音又說道：「葉少爺，你怎麼想着到這裏來，你是來看我的孫子孫女兒的嗎？他們，他們在他們的爸爸死了以後，胳膊上裏着黑紗，回到雙橋來過一次，我問他們裏着那東西做什麼，他們還說是紀念一個朋友。把生身之父當做朋友，把我蒙在鼓裏，葉少爺，你想想，够痛心不够痛心？」維　道：「後來，太伯母怎麼知道的？」陳老太太道：後來我寫信去上海，要兒子孫子孫女兒回來過年，要雇了木匠和漆匠泥水匠，給他們把房間整理整理。這個老媽媽，勸我不必，說老爺少爺小姐是不會回來的了。</p>

<h3>The Difficulties of the Chongqing Regime's Northwest "Centralization"</h3>
<p>The Chongqing government is currently continuing to adhere to the policy of protracted war, further relying on Britain and the United States externally and superficially accommodating the Soviet Union. Internally, there is the recent "uproarious" movement for Northwest "Centralization." Why implement the Northwest "Centralization" policy? Firstly, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the international routes in the Southwest were blocked, and the highly anticipated Burma Road had become the advance route of the Japanese army. Thus, the Chongqing side's attention shifted to transportation and resource development in the Northwest. Secondly, in the five years since the Sino-Japanese War, the power of the Chinese Communist Party and its army had been expanding daily, causing the Chongqing government great anxiety. They wanted to take advantage of the so-called strategic stalemate to bring the Northwest under the Chongqing government's control militarily, politically, and especially economically. Under these two major goals, the slogan of Northwest "Centralization" resonated loudly. However, the content of the so-called Northwest "Centralization" policy is, at least for now, limited to the economic aspect, so we will briefly study this aspect to see what its prospects are.</p>
<p>Since the Incident, the Chongqing side's economic difficulties have always been the most serious. Firstly, the increased reliance on Britain and the United States has led to the loss of the foundation of "self-reliance," and all economic policies have lost their autonomy. Secondly, there is an imbalance in the distribution of industry. Of the 639 relocated factories, only 27 were relocated to the Northwest, with the rest concentrated in the Southwest, especially in Sichuan. In terms of development, over 1,300 factories have been established in the Southwest, while only 73 have been established in the Northwest. Moreover, 80% of the various industries in the Northwest are concentrated in a few major cities in Shaanxi, with Gansu only slightly developed. New industries account for only 20-30%. This unreasonable phenomenon not only affects the adjustment of the national economy and people's livelihoods, but also affects the policy of domestic and foreign materials, forming the main root cause of the Chongqing side's material panic and weak combat effectiveness in recent years. (See this newspaper's Macau dispatches on the 8th and 9th of this month regarding the shortage of materials in Chongqing.) This phenomenon is more distressing to the Chongqing side than political or even military difficulties. After the Greater East Asia War, the Chongqing side's distress increased, leading to the slogan of changing the industrial construction policy and building a "New Northwest." On one hand, Chiang Kai-shek, Wong Wen-hao, and others traveled to the Northwest, constantly holding various military, political, and economic meetings; on the other hand, they launched "civilian" economic activities, such as the expansion of discussions on developing Northwest resources by the "Chinese Institute of Engineers," and the joint formation of the "Northwest Industrial Inspection Group" by the "Industrial and Mining Adjustment Office" and the "Chongqing Industrial Community" to conduct special surveys in various parts of the Northwest. All of this shows the Chongqing government's past failures regarding the Northwest, as well as its current distress in the Southwest, forcing it to loudly proclaim the tune of Northwest "Centralization."</p>
<p>However, the so-called Northwest "Centralization" is not as ideal as imagined, and the Chongqing government has encountered many difficulties.</p>
<p>First, although the Northwest has sufficient conditions for development in terms of resources, labor, and capital, the development of Northwest industry is not an easy task due to transportation, people's livelihoods or purchasing power, power supply, and climate. It can be said that there are many difficulties. The fact that the Chongqing side's industry has been concentrated in the Southwest for the past five or six years, while no one has paid attention to the Northwest, shows that the conditions for industrialization in the Northwest are too poor, or at least not something that the general industrial community dares to lightly attempt. Even if the Chongqing government has great determination, where will it get the huge amount of capital, technical talent, and mechanical industries? Moreover, does it have the patience to wait for the harvest after ten or twenty years?</p>
<p>Second, based on the development of industry in the Southwest, it can be seen that the coordination of various industrial sectors is quite chaotic, and some businesses that can make huge profits often flock to them, resulting in the abnormal development of certain industrial sectors. The alcohol industry is one example. From a departmental perspective, there is a lack of adjustment in production, leading to phenomena such as scrambling for raw materials, poaching skilled workers, and the crude manufacture of finished products. The machinery manufacturing industry is one example. The Southwest, which is relatively most suitable for industrial development, still has such serious shortcomings. As for the Northwest, there are even more weaknesses: such as (1) the lack of machine, copper, iron industries and power supply. (The total capital of the industrial and mining industries is only more than 500,000 yuan, and the total capital of the machinery manufacturing industry is only more than 880,000 yuan). (2) Inconvenient transportation. (The freight cost for a journey of tens of miles is often two to seven or eight times the price of the goods). (3) It is not easy to import foreign raw materials. Even if the China-Soviet route is unblocked in the future, there will not be much expectation for the import of raw materials and machinery. (4) There is a lack of technical talent, even more so than in the Southwest. The most important of these difficulties is the first, because the lack of a considerable foundation in heavy industry and power prevents the gradual expansion of new industries and transportation projects that have already taken shape, thus restricting the entire resource development and economic construction policy.</p>
<p>Third, judging from the general sentiments of the economic and industrial circles, there are also serious obstacles to the Chongqing government's so-called construction of a "New Northwest," because so far, the Northwest is still the poorest, undeveloped virgin land, and it is most difficult to develop such barren land with inconvenient transportation, unsuitable climate, scarce products, and ignorant and few people. This is not comparable to investing in developed land, and even more different from investing in commercial speculation. It is unimaginable for the Southwest economic circles, who are accustomed to making war fortunes, to change and engage in the development of the poor and barren Northwest. Moreover, the Chongqing government has not given the manufacturers who bring capital to develop the Northwest any special convenience, assistance, or reduction of burdens in terms of transportation, capital, supply of foreign raw materials, tariff burdens, and general political conditions. How can it improve the general manufacturers' enthusiasm for industrial construction? Judging from the current difficult situation of the Southwest industrial circles, it can be predicted that the Southwest business community will inevitably hesitate to move forward with the "Development of the Northwest." In that case, relying only on a portion of the Chongqing government's strength, manpower, and financial resources will be insufficient, and the so-called development of the Northwest will become an empty slogan. If the Chongqing government does not establish a foundation in the economic construction of the Northwest, then the so-called Northwest "Centralization" will only become an empty slogan. Moreover, in politics, there is still estrangement between the "Central" and the "Local," and between the "Government" and the people, and they cannot yet cooperate sincerely.</p>
<p>The Northwest "Centralization" will become an empty slogan, and the situation in the Southwest is precarious. Then, the future of the Chongqing regime is very clear. Isn't it time for the people under the Chongqing regime to seriously consider their future?</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Air Force Stationed in Burma Attacks Chittagong, India, Causing Extremely Heavy Damage to British Military Facilities</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th, Central News Agency dispatch. The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at noon today that the Imperial Army Air Force in Burma carried out air raids on Chittagong, India, on December 5th and 10th, causing heavy damage to British air force ships and military facilities. As of today, the major battle results have been confirmed as follows: (1) British damage: 10 aircraft shot down (including 3 unconfirmed), 7 ships sunk, 10 heavily or lightly damaged, 4-5 fires, 8 land facilities including railway stations, wharves, and warehouses hit, and 1 train on fire. (2) Japanese damage: 2 aircraft have not returned.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 15th, Central News Agency dispatch. According to a New Delhi dispatch, the Japanese Air Force raided Chittagong on the night of the 10th, causing heavy damage to various military facilities. Tokyo, 15th, Domei News Agency dispatch. According to sources close to the Japanese Navy, it was announced today that the British army's attempt to land at Chittagong was thwarted by two attacks by the Japanese Army Air Force on December 5th and 10th. This move by the British was not only intended to strengthen their outpost on the Indo-Burmese border, but also to disperse some of the Japanese forces in the Solomon Islands. As a result of the sudden attack by Japanese aircraft, more than twenty-one British ships were sunk, damaged, or set on fire, and the British port base's railway station and other land facilities were also heavily damaged. The British convoy, which was subjected to this fierce attack by the Japanese Air Force, consisted of forty transport ships, one small cruiser, and five gunboats. The Japanese Air Force learned of the British army's intention to land quite early and dispatched large formations of fighters and bombers, breaking through intense anti-aircraft fire and fighter resistance, achieving a brilliant victory. Of the seven enemy aircraft that were confirmed to have been shot down, five were Hurricane fighters, one was a P-40 fighter, and one was a P-26 fighter. In addition, it is believed that three other enemy aircraft were also shot down. After further investigation, it is hoped that the enemy's losses will prove to be even greater than previously known. The enemy has also admitted that Chittagong was attacked and suffered significant losses. The so-called counter-offensive by the British and American forces has already begun, mobilizing combined land and air forces in the South Pacific and fiercely counterattacking in the Solomon Sea. On the other hand, the Chongqing side and the British and Americans are planning joint military operations on the western front in Asia to recover Burma, continuing guerrilla warfare in the air while rushing reinforcements to the Indian border. This is an attempt by the British and American forces to disperse Japanese forces in the Solomon Islands. It goes without saying that the Japanese army has established a kind of organization for this serious enemy strategy, enabling the Japanese army to launch rapid attacks at any time when opportunities arise. A case in point is the large-scale attack by the Japanese Air Force on enemy air bases in Tinsukia and Chittagong at the end of October, which dealt a fatal blow to the enemy's attempt to strengthen its outposts and bases. Since then, the Japanese Air Force has continued to attack enemy military facilities. The recent battle was to encircle and annihilate a large enemy convoy full of troops. The recent repeated attacks have proven the effectiveness of the Japanese organization, which can strike before the enemy and break their counter-offensive plans. It is especially noteworthy that the Japanese air units only targeted enemy facilities and inflicted fatal damage with accurate bombing. The Japanese Air Force is said to be following the principle of not harming the Indian public in any way.</p>
<h3>Results of the Japanese Air Force in the New Guinea Area: 44 Enemy Aircraft Destroyed, 2 Patrol and Transport Ships Sunk</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th, Domei dispatch. The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM today that, during the period from November 24th to December 8th, the Japanese Naval Air Force shot down and destroyed a total of 44 enemy aircraft on the ground in the New Guinea area, and sunk two enemy patrol ships and two transport ships near Buna in the eastern part of the island. During the same period, nine Japanese aircraft did not return, several of which deliberately crashed into enemy targets.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th, Domei News Agency dispatch. The naval community revealed today that the Japanese Navy shot down 44 enemy aircraft and sunk two enemy patrol ships and two transport ships in the battle of Buna in eastern New Guinea within 15 days. This battle was conducted under the most adverse weather conditions. At that time, the sky above the forest was covered with dark clouds, hindering air operations, and the steep terrain of the Owen Stanley Range made the work of the naval units even more difficult. The Japanese attack began on December 16th, when two small and large enemy aircraft and one fighter were shot down near Na Bo, and one enemy transport ship was sunk at sea. On December 28th, Japanese aircraft sank two enemy patrol ships. On December 30th, Japanese Navy bombers and fighter squadrons engaged a large enemy aircraft formation, setting fire to and shooting down ten enemy Aira Cobra P-39 aircraft and thirteen Curtis P-40 aircraft, and destroying three large enemy aircraft on the ground. On December 1st, the Japanese Air Force launched another attack, shooting down one North American B-25 medium bomber and one Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress. On December 6th, Japanese Navy pilots sank one enemy transport ship, and a fierce air battle took place the next day. The Japanese Air Force shot down four enemy Aira Cobra P-39 aircraft, one Republic P-40 aircraft, and three Boeing P-40 aircraft. On December 8th, three Boeing B-17 bombers were shot down in an air battle. At the same time, Japanese naval units continued to conduct fierce operations in the New Guinea area, echoing the Japanese Naval Air Force, which began attacking enemy air forces in the Solomon Islands on August 7th, destroying enemy air forces.</p>
<h3>War Results of the Japanese Army in the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai. After the Chongqing army in the Third War Zone suffered a major blow in the Zhejiang-Jiangxi operations, it still attempted to revive its declining trend. The Fifth War Zone also tried its best to avoid attacks by the Japanese army. The movements of the Chongqing Communist army in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River were very passive, and they only repeated old tunes and vigorously promoted the "Winter General Counter-Offensive." The Japanese army's first line units accumulated markers to search for traces of the enemy army, and launched occasional attacks, continuing to suppress and punish them. The main war results in November are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) After a certain unit swept away the New Fourth Army near Dagang Town, south of Yancheng, at the end of October, it turned its attention to a surprise attack on the New Fourth Army near Fanchuan Town, west of Xinghua, on the 8th. The New Fourth Army abandoned 27 corpses and captured 10 people.</p>
<p>(2) A certain garrison team pursued about 300 members of the New Fourth Army along the coast northeast of Fuying for three days starting on the 8th. The New Fourth Army abandoned 80 corpses, captured 6 people, and intercepted 1 light machine gun and 33 rifles.</p>
<p>(3) Near Pai Tou Town, between Zhuji and Yiwu, at the beginning of this month, the battalion commander of the 16th Division led about 18 troops to participate in appeasement operations. On the 16th, a certain Japanese army unit discovered that the bandits were moving north from Changcun Bridge, east of the area, and immediately annihilated them. The bandits abandoned 35 corpses, captured 18 people, and intercepted a large number of military weapons.</p>
<p>(4) In the Hongze Lake operations, the Japanese garrison team thoroughly swept the Third Division in the northeast area and the Fourth Division in the northwest area of Hongze Lake for about two weeks since the 15th, abandoning 264 corpses, capturing 66 people, and intercepting 245 rifles, one mortar, and 229 cannons. Military facilities destroyed included 2 divisional headquarters, 2 brigade headquarters, 2 cadre training centers, 2 weapons factories, and 1 clothing factory. In addition, the New Fourth Army, which was being transferred to the south bank of Hongze Lake, was swept away. The New Fourth Army abandoned 40 corpses and intercepted 2 light machine guns and other military supplies.</p>
<p>(5) From the 26th to the beginning of December, a suppression operation was carried out against the New Fourth Army in the middle area between the Tianjin-Pukou and Huainan lines, achieving great results.</p>
<p>(6) On the 21st, about 1,000 members of the 21st Division were attacked near Dancheng, southwest of Xuzhou, abandoning 80 corpses and intercepting one heavy mortar and 58 rifles. On the same day, the garrison team learned that an internal strife had occurred in the 2nd Security Regiment near Niubu, downstream of the Yangtze River Tongling, and immediately surrounded them, capturing 109 people and destroying their stronghold.</p>
<p>(7) A certain unit began operations on the 30th to sweep away the Salvation Army who had infiltrated south of Danyang on the Huainan line. By the 2nd, the Salvation Army had abandoned 133 corpses, captured 17 people, and intercepted 3 light machine guns and 44 rifles.</p>
<p>The consolidated war results for November are as follows: The Chongqing Communist army abandoned 1,325 corpses, captured 1,129 people, 511 people participated in the appeasement operations, intercepted 284 cannons, 4 mortars, 21 light machine guns, 8 self-made rifles, 1,295 rifles, 158 pistols, and 7 grenade launchers.</p>

<h3>Talking about the South Pacific Naval Battle and the Decisive Battle of Tomorrow – Participants in the Dialogue: Colonel Hirade, Head of the Naval Press Department of the General Headquarters</h3>
<p>— To-Nichi Editor Tamaki Abe Ken</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Translated from the December 13th "Sunday Mainichi"</p>
<p>·Numbers are Not Believable·</p>
<p>Hirade: Of course, there are people who believe in numbers, but seeing the disparity in the military strength of Japan and the United States in this naval battle, some people believe that Britain and the United States will definitely perish, holding such extremely optimistic thoughts. I think that most people think that way now. As a matter of fact, compared to the beginning of the war, isn't our country increasingly entering a favorable situation? No matter how much they build, we naturally have to build that much. But it is not necessary for the numbers to be exactly the same. As long as the trend is the same. We must maintain this absolute number for how much we can use to counter the enemy's amount.</p>
<p>Abe: There are rumors in the United States that they are manufacturing large quantities of airplanes, tanks, and warships. This may be a kind of propaganda, or a defense of defeat to deceive the people, or even just a political facade for the election. What is your opinion on this point?</p>
<p>Hirade: The enemy is propagating it greatly. Only the numbers are certain. There are various shortages of materials, but the shortage of labor, especially skilled workers, is very troublesome. To take a step back, even if Roosevelt's plan works completely, the content is very doubtful. This is Roosevelt's gimmick, we don't need to be surprised.</p>
<p>Abe: How long does it take to train aviation soldiers, air force personnel, naval soldiers, etc.? Please tell me.</p>
<p>Hirade: There are some differences between Japan and the United States on this point. In Japan, even barefoot people are now manufacturing highly scientific weapons (this can also be said to be the amazing thing about the Japanese), so long-term training is necessary. Americans have received highly scientific education since childhood. Children know how to disassemble and assemble radios at the age of fourteen or fifteen, they know how to disassemble and assemble cars and can start ordinary repairs. We cannot compare with them. It does not mean that how many years the Japanese need is the same number of years the Americans need. In their case, because of the different preparatory education, some common knowledge can be instilled in a short period of time. However, it is by no means a matter of one or two days to become the commander-in-chief of a large fleet or the captain of a large warship. No matter what country it is, it takes at least ten years to train a captain, thirty years for a captain, and forty years for a commander. No matter how anxious you are, it is impossible to train a captain or commander by relying on short-term courses.</p>
<p>Abe: In that case, they also have to train a large number of talents with 1943 and 1944 as the goals!</p>
<p>Hirade: Yes. They have to do that. However, in such a short period of time, they can only train commanders who have been defeated. What the United States is now troubled by is the lack of grand marshal talents. Like skilled workers, grand marshals cannot be trained in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Abe: Also, I think the cooperation of the Axis navies is very important. Although Germany is a land army country, their submarine activities have also considerably damaged the trade lines of Britain and the United States. If the Japanese and German navies join forces, it is by no means one plus one equals two, but more than two. Japan has submarines to visit Germany, and recently Germany has also transferred many submarines eastward from Africa. This is a good thing. I am a layman when it comes to naval operations. If possible, I hope that both sides will manufacture large submarines of 10,000 to 20,000 tons. Speaking of which, do things like submarines exist?</p>
<h3>Southern Soviet Army in S City Forced to Retreat to Second Defense Line; Timoshenko's Troops at Risk of Being Surrounded</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 15th, Domei News Agency dispatch. Yesterday, Soviet troops fiercely attacked German army lines in the central Rzhev district and the southern Stalingrad district, but the German army counterattacked fiercely, forcing the Soviet troops to retreat to the second defense line. The Moscow command admitted that the German army's counterattack southwest of Stalingrad against General Timoshenko's Soviet troops had forced the Red Army to retreat three to four kilometers along a forty-kilometer-long front line. The German army, with infantry and tanks, attacked the Red Army in four groups from the flanks, and the Red Army was at risk of being surrounded, so it was ordered to withdraw. German reinforcements west of Rzhev are increasing day and night, increasing the pressure. Moscow news admitted that the German army launched seven consecutive counterattacks on one point of the Soviet army line overnight. The entire central Soviet line seemed to have frequent attack battles. The German blitz troops and infantry took the brunt, braving heavy snow and fighting bloody battles, severely damaging the Soviet army.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 15th, Haituong News Agency dispatch. A correspondent from the British Exchange Telegraph Agency in Moscow reported that the German army launched a large-scale attack on the Soviet front line from the Caucasus to the Kotelnikovo railway line starting on Monday, advancing north and northeast in an attempt to break General Timoshenko's defense line. The German strength is said to be comparable to the German army that launched the offensive in Stalingrad in mid-October.</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th, Haituong News Agency dispatch. According to the latest news, fierce fighting is still taking place in the Don River bend. Military personnel here only said that "the German army is resisting stubbornly," but it is clear that the German army has begun important military operations. According to Moscow news, the town of Kotelnikovo, located between the Don River and the Kalmyk Steppe on the Stalingrad-Novorossiysk railway, fierce fighting began near the town yesterday. The southern wing of the Soviet army in Stalingrad may be severely threatened. German aircraft attacked the Soviet airfield the night before, destroying 16 Soviet aircraft. German and friendly forces in various places have made progress. The Soviet army south of Stalingrad has not launched a fierce attack, probably because General Timoshenko was forced to transfer troops elsewhere. The Soviet army attacked between Kalinin and Lake Ilmen, losing many tanks. The Damian district lost 62 vehicles. The Soviet army lost a total of 145 tanks and 37 aircraft the day before. Germany only lost 4. It is estimated that the Soviet army has lost approximately 3,000 tanks since launching the winter offensive on November 21st. This is the result of the Soviet tanks failing to make contact with the infantry. Heavy snow in the Caucasus has silenced the war situation. The Soviet army only attacked the German positions northeast of Tuapse in western Caucasus again, but was repelled after a melee.</p>
<h3>Japanese Great Political Association Branch Offers Aircraft Movement</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th, Central News Agency dispatch. Since the Tokyo branch of the Great Political Assistance Association launched the military aircraft donation campaign in March, town associations in various districts of the city have enthusiastically donated. As of the 27th of last month, it has exceeded 2.5 million yen, with the predetermined amount reaching 3,777,860 yen and 96 sen. The association will gather the funds and hold a donation ceremony at Hibiya Public Hall at 1:00 PM on the 16th. These funds will purchase 27 army aircraft and 18 navy aircraft. The remaining 270,000 yen will be used to purchase 12 Tokyo-style barrage balloons for air defense in Tokyo.</p>
<h3>Ren Haichang Goes to Guangdong to Inspect the Navy</h3>

<h3>Japanese Industry and Economy Representatives Hold Informal Discussion, Tojo Attends and Delivers a Speech</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - As the Great East Asian War enters its second year, the Japanese government, in order to further unite the country's total strength, establish a winning system, and ensure victory in the war, convened a production enhancement meeting between government officials and the public on November 15th to hold informal discussions with powerful representatives from various sectors. On the 27th of the same month, a temporary production enhancement committee and local liaison coordination councils were established to actively study various strategies for expanding production capacity. Furthermore, in light of the fact that the enemy countries of Britain and the United States are attempting to adjust their counter-offensive posture by utilizing their massive production capacity, it is an urgent task to strike at the enemy's economic power. Therefore, with the expansion of production capacity as the center and with the aim of establishing a support system for daily life, the government again gathered powerful leaders from the national industrial and economic circles and convened a discussion meeting with representatives from the industrial and economic circles at the Prime Minister's official residence at 8:20 AM on the 15th. Prime Minister Tojo, Director-General of the Planning Board Suzuki, other cabinet members, the four cabinet chiefs, vice ministers of various ministries, and representatives of other relevant agencies attended. On the private sector side, there were over 360 powerful representatives from various industries and economic sectors, including national industry, finance, transportation, agriculture, forestry, and fisheries. Prime Minister Tojo first gave a speech, stating that as the Great East Asian War enters its second year, the victory or defeat of the war will be determined by the superiority of the production capacity of the Empire and the enemy countries of Britain and the United States. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary for our country's industrial and economic power to become combat power and establish a support system for daily life with genuine Japanese characteristics. He deeply hoped that people in the industrial and economic circles would rise up together. Then the informal discussion began. Each attending representative expressed their opinions and hopes regarding government facilities for expanding production capacity and increasing national strength. There was a lunch break at noon, and the informal discussion continued in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - His Majesty the Emperor of Japan is very concerned about the trends in the domestic industrial and economic circles during the Great East Asian War. On the morning of the 15th, he made an exception and granted an audience to a group of over 380 representatives attending the industrial and economic circles informal discussion in the palace. Led by Prime Minister Tojo, they lined up and entered the palace. At 10:00 AM, His Majesty the Emperor appeared in the West Hall, and all the attending representatives respectfully paid their respects and then withdrew from the palace.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - Prime Minister Tojo attended the National Industrial and Economic Representatives Informal Discussion today and delivered a speech to encourage the representatives. In the speech, the Prime Minister explained the strengths of the Japanese army, stating that the strength of the Japanese army lies in His Majesty the Grand Marshal personally leading the troops, having unparalleled spiritual strength in the world, and having commanders with skillful command. They regard righteousness as heavy as a mountain and death as light as a feather as the spirit of the military, and regard killing the enemy as an attacking spirit. This superior spiritual strength is the foundation of their strict adherence to military discipline. Furthermore, the Japanese army's unique command and training are also a reason for its strength. For many years, the Japanese army's strength has been restricted due to grain issues, and therefore it is slightly insufficient in quantity. In order to remedy this shortcoming, under the general policy of prioritizing quality, they have undergone intense training. Today, their power has been fully demonstrated in this war. They are still accelerating training in the country to seek improvement. At the current stage of the war, it is worth mentioning that the strength of the Japanese army lies in the strategic advantages gained from the victories in the early battles. This is clear from looking at the map. When we think about the importance of the air force, we deeply appreciate it. A large number of important resources that can be used for military purposes have now been seized from the enemy and are under our control. This further proves the strength of the Japanese army. The Japanese army has consolidated its confidence in victory and is determined to continue fighting to the end in order to win the final victory.</p>

<h3>Japanese Government Implements Petroleum Monopoly</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - In order to meet the needs of wartime national defense and industry, the Japanese government has decided to implement a petroleum monopoly system. The outline of the monopoly law was announced on the 14th and will be submitted to the Diet. According to the authorities of the Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the government has decided to submit the bill to the Diet to implement the petroleum monopoly system. This monopoly is a temporary measure under wartime conditions. The reason for implementing this system is that, in view of the fact that petroleum, a basic material for national defense and industry during the Great East Asian War, has an inseparable relationship with military demand, in order to ensure the needs of officials and the public and to implement a high degree of allocation, the government will take the initiative to manage and allocate it properly.</p>

<h3>Chiang Kai-shek Inspects Northwest, Recognizes Northwest as a Base for National Construction, But Land is Barren and People are Poor, Development is Difficult</h3>
<p>According to recent visitors from Chongqing, Chiang Kai-shek personally went to various provinces in the Northwest in September for a month-long inspection. After returning to Chongqing, he proclaimed that "the Northwest is a base for national construction." Therefore, attention that was previously concentrated in the Southwest is gradually shifting to the Northwest. Furthermore, on October 5th, Wu Jingheng reported on his observations from an inspection of the Northwest, stating that the development of the Northwest should prioritize transportation construction, especially railways. However, according to those familiar with the situation in the Northwest, with the exception of Xinjiang, which is rich in land and sparsely populated, the remaining provinces are generally experiencing years of famine and the people are impoverished. The desolation of the Northwest has been going on for a long time due to the depletion of the land's fertility. In Gansu, there are many fields that yield a harvest only once every five years. Gansu and Shaanxi are completely barren, with no trees to be seen for thousands of miles. Furthermore, the prices in Xi'an are skyrocketing unreasonably, mainly due to the manipulation of bank funds.</p>

<h3>Kunming Commodity Prices in a State of Turmoil, Speculative Traders Manipulate Prices, Restrictive Laws Have Little Effect</h3>
<p>Since the incident, Kunming has seen the emergence of many new industries, and the market has suddenly prospered. This year, after the fall of Rangoon and the cutting of the Jinhua Road, many officials, merchants, and speculative traders who sell short have moved to Kunming, regarding it as paradise. They are unwilling to be lonely and use their winning business methods to create many bizarre black markets, enveloping the entire Kunming market in these atmospheres.</p>
<p>Naturally, under this state of affairs, prices are rising higher and higher. Although the Price Stabilization Bureau has convened meetings with financial tycoons, representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and trade associations to discuss and establish many restrictive and curbing laws, they can only provide temporary calm. They do not reduce speculative behavior due to government restrictions because there are many bogus merchants with power and backing! We can see the inside story in the following examples.</p>
<p>Continuous Rise in Cigarette Prices</p>
<p>Cigarettes are managed by the Cigarette Monopoly Bureau and are not subject to price controls by the Price Stabilization Bureau. When the Price Stabilization Bureau convened a meeting, the representative of the Monopoly Bureau replied to everyone's inquiries, saying: "The source has decreased, and supply cannot meet demand, so we had to raise the selling price to limit consumption. However, the rising trend is still high and unabated, which is really a last resort to prevent private hoarding." This reply was given a straightforward rebuttal by the chairman of the Price Stabilization Bureau: "... The Cigarette Monopoly Bureau is public, how can the public not stabilize prices while merchants do? Regardless of public or private, all must stabilize prices." This was followed by a heated and intense debate.</p>
<p>But debate as they might, prices still rose, stabilizing once and then rising again. Especially after the ban on the import of foreign cigarettes and news of price increases in Chongqing and Guiyang came, the rising trend was fierce and even more alarming. The location of the cigarette market is in a corner of the New Market outside Heguo Gate. There are hundreds of large and small cigarette merchants here who receive and sell goods, and the price of cigarettes immediately soars when they change hands. In mid-August, when the rising trend was at its highest, someone even used small travel vehicles to rush to collect goods, buying everything they saw, opening up a new situation of rushing to collect goods, a new situation that would become material for regret in the future.</p>
<p>Cigarettes are difficult to buy, but there are still many smokers. The nouveau riche, of course, do not care, and speculators do not pay attention to them, but university professors with thoughts have to switch to smoking Parrot brand cigarettes, which cost one yuan for four cigarettes. This type of cigarette, which is not suitable for refined tastes, has unexpectedly become a precious item for scholars to boost their literary thoughts.</p>
<p>Gold Price and Foreign Currency</p>
<p>The rise in gold prices was originally expected, but no one expected it to be so fast. Gold shops confused the price of gold with the cost of labor, vaguely raising prices. Within a month, the price of gold bars rose from 3,950 yuan to over 5,000 yuan.</p>
<p>In the foreign currency market, the buying and selling of rupees rose from seven yuan per rupee to seven yuan and five jiao. After the bank announced that it would stop exchanging rupees from August 18th, hoarders rushed to sell them, and money shops also refused to accept them, so it was quiet for a while. The buying and selling of US dollars rose from 32 yuan to 34 yuan.</p>
<p>Amidst the calls for price stabilization, cigarettes and gold managed to remain free from the restrictions of price stabilization. These two items have the greatest guilt for stimulating the general rise in prices.</p>

<p>Forum on Food Issues</p>
<h3>Food Control</h3>
<p>— Tie Min</p>
<p>I would like to briefly present my humble opinion on the control of food, for the reference of the concession authorities and the government agencies in charge of food.</p>
<p>(1) Since the elimination of British and American influence, the Shanghai concessions and the surrounding peaceful areas have almost become one in politics and military affairs. Therefore, in terms of economy and materials, they can also be integrated to make the concessions and non-concessions one, restoring the pre-war state. However, in order to prevent unscrupulous merchants from hoarding and speculating and raising prices, it is appropriate to implement control methods to crack down on them.</p>
<p>(2) The current food control in the Shanghai concessions is nominal. Although there is a price limit, the black market is still rampant, such as rice, flour, sugar, and oil. This phenomenon does not exist in the peaceful areas, but it is unique to Shanghai because the control methods are not perfect and the control area is limited to one corner.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the control of food, the concession authorities and the Chinese government must work together to form a unified system. The region should be wide, the scale should be large, and the organization should be tight. It should not be limited to Shanghai City alone, and it should not be limited to one corner of the concession, but should at least include the central China provinces. All purchases, transportation, and sales must be registered and licensed. At the same time, attention should be paid to increasing food production. In this way, the adjustment of supply and demand and the price standard will be controlled by the control agency, and the speculative hoarding of unscrupulous merchants will have no way to operate.</p>
<p>(4) Miscellaneous grains are used to supplement the shortage of rice and flour, and the working class relies on them for survival. Therefore, it is especially necessary to ensure that they are circulated without obstruction and that prices are lowered. Even small people who traffic in small amounts of rice and wheat can be treated with leniency. In fact, once materials are circulated and the scope of control is expanded, small people will have no profit to be made and will stop without being prohibited.</p>
<p>(5) The ration of rice for concession households must be increased to the point where one person has enough food for ten days. If the concession authorities do not have enough food in storage to supply, it is better to give up and find another way to implement large-scale, systematic control.</p>
<p>(6) Currently, Shanghai is undergoing a period of clearing the countryside, and the smooth circulation of various materials should be forgiven by the concession authorities and the Chinese food agencies. However, in the future, preparations must be made immediately and the organization must be started in order to rationalize food control and achieve it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The above points are only based on the current situation and the state of the concessions, and do not address the overall plan for food control nationwide. In short, the author's main point is to first enable the circulation of food between the concessions and the peaceful areas, and then to break the boundaries between the concessions and non-concessions and implement large-scale, organized control. As for how to organize and operate this control? On the one hand, the assistance of friendly countries is required, and cooperation with friendly countries is necessary when necessary. On the one hand, the Chinese government, especially the Shanghai Municipal Government, is expected to plan and implement it so that food control can be effective and fair, and so that the citizens of Shanghai can live and work in peace and no longer suffer from the extreme pain of food shortages.</p>
<h3>Excellent Results in Light Control Drills; Comprehensive Air Defense Training Begins; Firefighting, Rescue, and Poison Prevention Exercises to be Held in Designated Areas</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "North China Daily News," Mr. Arikawa, the assistant chief of the Public Concession Police Department, recently told reporters that the police have decided to hold a variety of special drills during the air defense period to train the personnel responsible for vigilance and light control. These include air defense measures such as poison prevention and firefighting, and extinguishing incendiary bombs. Police officers, Baojia personnel, fire brigades, and health department personnel of the Public Concession will participate in the exercises. Mr. Arikawa also commented on the light control situation last night (the 14th), saying that Deputy Police Chief Major Gojima personally patrolled last night and inspected from the rooftops of the Broadway Mansions and Wing On Company. He saw that the light control south of the Suzhou Creek was quite satisfactory, but north of the Suzhou Creek, many lights were still visible, especially in the Hongkou West District near Zhabei. Mr. Arikawa also stated that yesterday (the 14th), the light control started at 1 PM and continued until dawn. Therefore, unless air defense measures are lifted, citizens should not turn on lights in the early morning. If the vigilance and light control start in the afternoon, citizens should dim the lights when turning them on in the evening, rather than waiting for notification from the Baojia personnel. (Further report) Since the formal start of the air defense exercise the night before last, the vigilance and control status has not been lifted. At 9:20 AM yesterday, a loud air raid alarm sounded, and the entire city was in a state of tension. Roads were blocked with ropes, and all kinds of vehicles stopped moving. However, pedestrians could slowly walk along the sidewalks on both sides of the road. This state of alert continued until 11 AM when the all-clear signal was sounded, and normalcy was restored. In the evening, it started at 7:30 PM and ended at 9 PM.</p>
<p>Passive Defense Demonstration</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, Baojia personnel from various districts of the Public Concession, wearing armbands, observed various passive defense methods for air defense at the Racecourse. More than 2,000 Baojia personnel participated. A house made of bamboo mats had been set up in advance inside the Racecourse, and various performances were held around the house. To allow the Baojia personnel to learn and imitate, the firefighters demonstrated various actions. The performance program included: (1) Using buckets and hand-operated pumps to extinguish fires caused by incendiary bombs (single-line bucket brigade); (2) Demonstrating the use of yellow sand, dry mud, or fine ash, and long-handled iron shovels to rake and extinguish incendiary bombs. After the incendiary bombs are extinguished, use lead buckets containing yellow sand (or dry mud or fine ash) to move the incendiary bombs to a safe location; (3) Using iron bomb-extinguishing covers coated with fire-resistant cotton to extinguish incendiary bombs; (4) Using wet straw mats to extinguish incendiary bombs. After covering the incendiary bombs with straw mats, spray water on them; (5) Using wet straw mats to extinguish incendiary bombs. Instead of spraying water, cover the mats with sand and soil; (6) A house is set on fire by an incendiary bomb. Baojia self-defense team members attempt to extinguish it with buckets (using a double-line bucket brigade) and hand-operated pumps. Because the fire is too fierce to control, the fire brigade is called to the scene to put out the fire; (7) Firefighting demonstration: (A) Using powerful water jets to extinguish large fires; (B) Using a 150-foot automatic all-steel rotating ladder to rescue people from the top floors of tall buildings; (8) The fire brigade rescue team, wearing self-contained breathing apparatus and gas masks, enters a house filled with dense smoke to rescue trapped people. An ambulance arrives, and paramedics wearing gas masks assist in rescue work, and transport suffocated people to the aid station.</p>
<p>Comprehensive Training Program</p>
<p>According to a statement released by the Air Defense Section of the Public Concession Police Department, the Public Concession Police Department, Fire Department, and Health Department will, starting today, guide self-defense teams and Baojia personnel in holding comprehensive air defense training in sections, such as firefighting, rescue, and poison prevention.

<h3>A Record of the Rongwu Buddhist Society's Sutra Lectures</h3>
<p>The 74th lecture of the Rongwu Buddhist Society was on the subject of the "Unfilial Hell" from the Earth Store Bodhisattva Sutra. First, Yao Taiping introduced the Zen Master as the abbot of the Anting Bodhi Temple, recounting his history of arduous practice for a long time before he ascended the platform to begin the lecture. He strongly condemned the various sins of the unfilial that would lead them to hell, and earnestly exhorted people to fulfill their filial duties. The audience considered filial piety to be common to the five teachings. Those who had previously listened to Mr. Shen Juelin's lectures were very satisfied. The 75th lecture was by Mr. Yang Zhongyi on the study of I-Ching, saying that there are sixty-four hexagrams in the I-Ching, and their way is nothing more than one Yin and one Yang. Those who are pure Yin and Yang are Qian and Kun. Those whose miscellaneous objects write virtues and prepare for the question of the two instruments have sixty-two hexagrams, all of which are based on the Yin and Yang of the lines and the Yin and Yang of the positions, calculating their correctness and I, and judging their auspiciousness, fierceness, regret, and stinginess. In fact, the sentence "Those who are shocked without blame are good at making up for the past" is used to summarize it. Therefore, the I-Ching is a book of few transgressions. During the Spring and Autumn Period, the teaching of I-Ching flourished, and scholars were generally able to cite images and judge the I-Ching, and attribute words to the meaning of human affairs, one word and one action, and decide their auspiciousness, fierceness, nearness, and remoteness as a way to advance and retreat. In later generations, the way of I-Ching was lost, and what was popular in society was nothing more than the art of divination. However, the theory of the five elements of mutual generation and restraint, and the reasons for the prosperity and decline of the six relatives, all open up different paths outside the words of the hexagram lines, although the twelve line Chen Su Ben Jing Zheng's old sayings, but the purpose of Zhou Kong's line of praise, there is not the same.</p>
<h3>This Newspaper's Social Services Department Launches a Poverty Relief Campaign</h3>
<p>Mr. Gan Dounan Takes the Lead in Donating One Thousand Gold Pieces</p>
<p>At the beginning of this newspaper's resumption of publication, in response to the urgent needs of the environment, a Social Services Department was specially established to appeal on behalf of the poor, sick, and distressed compatriots. The first step is not to solicit donations from outside, but to first seek voluntary assistance from benevolent people. The second step is to carefully select fair and just people in society to organize a poverty relief committee, appropriately allocate funds, and disclose finances. At this severe winter, providing clothing and porridge is not only saving people, but also saving society, so that society sees less cruelty. This newspaper is launching a poverty relief fund campaign. Yesterday, Mr. Gan Dounan, manager of the Lixing Thermos Factory, generously donated one thousand yuan to take the lead in advocating and benefiting the poor. Mr. Gan's letter stated that recently, prices have skyrocketed, and the lives of most people in Shanghai are extremely difficult. In this severe winter, the north wind is biting, and the starving are everywhere. What is heard and seen is heartbreaking and lamentable. Therefore, your newspaper has added social service work, demonstrating enthusiasm and charity, not hesitating to work hard and loudly calling out for the benefit of society. Dounan is a member of society and will do his best by donating 1,000 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates, which is sent along with this letter. He deeply hopes that all circles will respond and make this frugal assistance to the sick a fashion. According to the notice, donations from all circles should be sent directly to the accounting office of this newspaper, and a receipt will be given as proof.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Declining Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Greater China Matches Uniquely Rise</p>
<p>Yesterday's Chinese stock market was still pressured by tight credit.  Various established stocks saw a sharp decline. Only Greater China Match shares, continuing the previous day's upward momentum, uniquely reached an unprecedented high price of $385, finally closing at $380, up $5.  As for others, such as the Sino-Western Pharmacy in the New Pharmaceutical Industry, there was little supply for the demand, rising $10 to a high of $460.  New Asia dropped $1 to $68.  Hsin Yi retreated to around $260, down more than $10.  Sino-French and Min Yi had sparse transactions at unchanged prices.  In the textile industry, only Fu Chang Dyeing and Weaving had some support, rising to $17.  The other smaller-denomination weaving stocks, such as Greater China and Hong Sheng, showed little improvement.  Wing On Textiles were flat and weak at $5.  The cultural industry saw the most severe declines, with Commercial Press at $460, China entering the $200 range, and World Book Company at $110, all down from $5 to $7.50.  In the department store sector, Sincere retreated to $145, then recovered to $7, still up a small $2.  Wing On and China Emporium were flat and weak at $0.50.  Public utilities declined $1, with Zhapu Water &amp; Electricity at $64 and China General Edison at $44.  Guan Sheng Yuan fluctuated between $350 and $360.  Most other stocks saw declines.  Trading was not quiet.  Details are listed below:</p>
<h3>Stagnant Bond Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the bond market became even more stagnant.  All respectable merchants who possessed physical bonds had disappeared.  The propertied class was even more hesitant.  It is evident that before the official announcement of how to handle bonds legally, everyone is naturally unwilling to test the law.  Only Class C bonds saw slight transactions, in very small quantities, peaking at $8 and then falling to around $7.30-7.40.  Very few people were talking about them.</p>
<h3>Gold Ornaments List Price Unchanged; Overnight Loan Interest Suddenly Rises 30%</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the list price for gold ornaments at jewelry stores in the city, starting with Da Hsin, was still $3350 per tael (buying in was $200 less).  The industry still lacks a centralized and official market price, often leading to the feeling that it is difficult to buy in when needed and there is a lack of counterparties for sales, making market prices prone to changes.  The morning bid for buying in was $3300, gradually rising to $3330-3340.  After 10:30, the supply exceeded demand, and the price immediately fell.  By noon, it was difficult to sell even at $3300, still up $40 from the previous day, with a difference of $40.  成交 was scarce.  The list price for silver ornaments was still $16 per tael, with inter-dealer transactions between $18.50 and $19.  Yesterday, the overnight loan interest rate at the Money Dealers Association suddenly rose 30% to 17%, indicating that credit conditions are tightening and difficult to ease.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw a slight weakening of the market price for Japanese military scrip, quoted at $5.55. The buying and selling prices at the shop fronts of money houses and small private banks were $5.545 and $5.56, respectively. Inter-dealer prices remained at $5.5535.</p>
<h3>Minimal Cotton Cloth Trading</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market atmosphere was quiet, with very few transactions. Sales offers in various markets remained weak and sluggish, and very little trading took place. Only 12-pound Fugui fine cloth was traded at $186.50. Dyed goods such as Fu Chou Bijou Shuxiang factory singles were $7.90. Peach Blossom Ms. Lin factory singles continued to fall, with afternoon bids at $297.50, while spot goods still required $303-$304.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Started weak but strengthened later, with fine cloth slightly rising. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth new singles still sold at $191 unchanged, but bank singles rose from $190 to $191.50, up $1. Caiqiu fine cloth was $191, Yanghe $190.50, Flying Fish $190.50, Trumpet $190, Wufu $189, but trading was not high. The closing price for Four Gentlemen serge red singles at noon was $7.53, a further decline of $0.02.</p>
<h3>End of Rising Trend for Woolen Fabrics</h3>
<p>Woolen fabrics, suitable for the cold season, saw sporadic transactions. However, bulk trading for hoarding gradually decreased. Medium-thick Serge Han Limeng, Valetine Gabardine Yuan Zhigong wholesale were sold at $180 to $240 per yard. Retail prices were limited to $235 to $270. Camel hair cashmere riding breeches wholesale sold for $225 to over $280, retail limited to $280-290 to $345. Meifeng Yuanzang grey plain overcoat fabric wholesale was $370 per yard, limited retail price was $440.</p>
<h3>Quiet Demand and Supply for Grains</h3>
<p>Yesterday's trade in coarse grains was quite quiet, due to the inconvenience of transportation amidst air raid alerts, resulting in both supply and demand being idle. The entire market only opened with 30 packages of Chongming Sand Yellow, priced at $305, and 15 packages of Sand Red, priced at $338. Ground prices remained firm.</p>
<h3>Dried Persimmon: A Good Companion for Starchy Foods</h3>
<p>Dried persimmons have rebounded in price recently due to previous low prices. The price increase in this city is 40-50 "ma" (a unit of measurement) higher than the lowest price, while the price increase in the capital city is nearly 100 "ma". This item is cooling in nature, very sweet, and contains persimmon frost, which is also a component of sugar. Therefore, some people now mash it, and it is even better with walnuts, as a filling for starchy foods, being sweet and delicious. We might as well try it, knowing that it is affordable and of good quality, to avoid the difficulties of squeezed sugar.</p>
<h3>Lily Buds Rebound</h3>
<p>Lily buds have recently rebounded due to actual sales, reversing the weakening trend. Openings have occurred daily, totaling 600-700 packages, rising $40-50 from the lowest price. Medium-grade goods opened at $540-550, and the market is gradually stabilizing.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes Distributed Yesterday</h3>
<p>The market for British and American cigarettes is still stable. Japanese cigarettes saw prices trend downwards as Huayuan distributed to retailers yesterday, successively distributing to Category A and B dealers. Domestic cigarettes saw quiet supply and demand, resulting in little price fluctuation. Trading volume was: Great Britain brand $9200, Old Knife brand $8300, Pinhai brand $8000, Wuhua brand $6400, Fairy brand $7400, Japanese cigarettes Golden Gun brand $2800, Golden Building $3550, 20-stick pack $3000, Compass brand $2350, domestic cigarettes Pyramid $6400, Beauty brand $5850, Golden Mouse brand $3900, White Gold Dragon $3950.</p>
<h3>1300 Barrels of Cooking Oil Shipped from Dalian to Shanghai Yesterday - Cooking Oil Problem Expected to be Resolved</h3>
<p>The issue of the cooking oil supply in this port has been ongoing since the military distribution group arranged for the previously ordered 5,000 dan of cooking oil to be shipped to Shanghai, distributed by the Cooking Oil Distribution Office and sold at various retail cooking oil stores, and continues to be distributed. Each person is limited to half a jin. Simultaneously, 500 barrels of cooking oil shipped from Dalian, equivalent to 2,000 dan, have also begun to be distributed to various retail cooking oil stores to meet market needs. Yesterday afternoon, a Datong News Agency reporter learned that another 1,300 barrels of cooking oil from Dalian were loaded and arrived in Shanghai yesterday and have already been moved to the warehouse. Payment and delivery procedures can be processed starting today. This batch of cooking oil will continue to be allocated to retailers. Subsequently, Dalian oil will continue to be shipped to Shanghai. Therefore, the problem of the cooking oil supply in this port is expected to no longer be interrupted.</p>
<h3>Army Press Chief Yokoyama Criticizes Anglo-American Hypocritical Propaganda</h3>
<p>(Dohmei News Agency, Shanghai) Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama, spokesperson for the Shanghai Japanese Army Press Department, stated at a press conference yesterday that the propaganda from the Allied nations has intensified recently, repeatedly attacking the personalities of Axis leaders. The foundation of propaganda judgment lies solely in accuracy. The anti-Axis propaganda lacks this accuracy. Any country that respects itself will not engage in slanderous words. Today, the anti-Axis nations have concentrated their propaganda efforts on repeatedly slandering Premier Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini, accusing the German premier of being psychologically disturbed or the Italian premier of suffering from a brain disease, merely exposing the Allied nations' own plight. The Allied leaders' minds must be disordered. The more intensely the Allied nations attack individuals, the more obvious the Allied nations' doomed plight becomes. President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill often repeat the platitudes of "restoring peace" after and "when we achieve final victory," no different from the cries of those about to drown, trying to convince themselves that they can still be saved. When these two Allied leaders suffer setbacks, they repeat these words, just like those about to drown clinging to floating weeds in an attempt to save themselves. The truth of propaganda can only be judged by the evidence that can be provided. If the anti-Axis nations could provide evidence, they would certainly present it. However, the anti-Axis nations have not obtained facts that can prove their "false words," so they can only speak of future hopes. The Allied nations repeatedly mention the Second Front, but it is actually better to say "the second Dunkirk." All the Allied nations can do is proclaim where the Second Front will be opened, either in Australia and India or in Africa or Europe. The spokesperson concluded that Chiang Kai-shek's wife's "pilgrimage" to the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union is another piece of evidence of the Allied nations' plight. Axis leaders have not been reduced to the point of having to send their wives door-to-door begging for help.</p>

<h3>It's Not Shameful to Seek Medical Treatment</h3>
<p>— New</p>
<p>As long as we live in this world of diseases, we believe that no one can claim that they have absolutely no ailments, nor can anyone predict that they will never get sick. In this world, so-called health is a relative rather than an absolute matter. In other words, it is normal for a person to have some ailments, whether minor or major, while having no ailments at all or never getting sick in the future is close to fantasy.</p>
<p>Suppose there are two people in front of us: one does not shy away from admitting that he is sick and is not afraid of his illness, openly seeking medical treatment, taking medicine, and recuperating; the other clearly has many ailments but insists on pretending to be a tough guy, avoids medical treatment, and sometimes even claims that his ailments are advantages rather than disadvantages, just like Ah Q's attitude towards his own scabs, and even goes further to claim that seeking medical treatment is unacceptable. Then, which of these two is ridiculous is clear, a fact that is self-evident without the need for wisdom.</p>
<p>It is not shameful to seek medical treatment. It is dangerous to be unaware of one's illness, or to be aware of it but afraid to seek treatment. For the sake of the nation's health, we hope that everyone seeks treatment when sick and exercises when healthy. Seeing others seeking medical treatment and treating it as a joke, exaggeratingly saying to them, "Look, even he has ailments!" Well, he is not a god descended from heaven, so how can he not have ailments? To regard the other person as a god who should have no ailments at all, is that not intending to destroy him but instead praising him, and is that not contrary to the original intention?</p>
<p>Ignoring one's own ailments and only looking for others' ailments is not a clever act. Hoping that others will also avoid medical treatment like oneself, or even using others' medical treatment as a foil to highlight one's own "health," is even a vice... Now is the time to get rid of this habit, isn't it?</p>
<p>Respect others, and others will respect you.</p>
<h3>After Reading Shi Hui's "Seventy Days of Mo Rong Tian Xi"</h3>
<p>— Nan Rong</p>
<p>--Originally published in "The Magazine," December issue</p>
<p>I have been reading articles about Tolstoy's writing attitude recently. It mentions that in the preface to his debut novel, "Childhood," Tolstoy included an explanation of his own rhetorical crudeness and lack of skill, believing it was because he sang with his stomach rather than his throat. According to him, the sound emitted from the throat, although more melodious than the sound from the abdomen, was not moving. The abdominal sound was the opposite: it was crude, but it penetrated the human spirit... Therefore, his writing method lacked uniformity, lacked fluency, and became awkward, and so on.</p>
<p>It has been a long time since I have read articles written with such abdominal sound. After reading Shi Hui's "Seventy Days of Mo Rong Tian Xi" in the December issue of "The Magazine," I felt that this artist used his life to perform his play and used his life to write his article. Some people may despise the so-called lack of uniformity, lack of fluency, and awkwardness in his writing, but that is precisely his abdominal sound, that is, the jumping and revealing of his life. On the contrary, we should pay attention to it.</p>
<p>There is also an article called "Genius Artist Shi Hui" in the same issue of "The Magazine." After reading "Seventy Days of Mo Rong Tian Xi," one will definitely feel that the word "genius" may lightly obscure the artist's hard work. For an artist's success, I believe that genius accounts for only 20-30%, and the majority relies on hard work. We see how Shi Hui's acting skills are obtained with the power of his whole life!</p>
<p>This article is mostly a manual for performing "The Big Circus," and it makes a very large contribution to the actors. Those who are engaged in drama today, as well as enthusiasts, should read it again and again. I will not mention more here.</p>
<p>What is worthy of our attention and becomes a problem is that "postscript." Not only does he depict "a picture of an artist's dying days," but it is actually the current social treatment of artists. I remember a certain philosopher saying: "What gives people the power to succeed is nothing more than a planned ambition and considerable poverty." So, the reason for saying "considerable" poverty is that too smooth circumstances will lose the training of genius, and too difficult a life will also ruin genius, even to the point of destruction.</p>
<p>"Another play is about to be rehearsed. A body that has not recovered from illness will eventually have a day when it stops moving."</p>
<p>In our society, will we watch a true artist utter such a desperate cry and let him be destroyed naturally?</p>
<p>Being oppressed by life and all kinds of persecutions seems to be something that serious artists often encounter, and this has become a precedent in history. Perhaps it is because artists are serious and faithful to art, and do not know how to ingratiate themselves, so it is difficult for the world to give them preferential treatment.</p>
<p>Shi Hui has this talent. Although he also expresses self-pity and self-sorrow in his writing, he is not so preoccupied with his own death that he must live. He is very tough. He humbly says: "I don't understand politics, and I don't understand economics," but in the conclusion, "In short, if the current social problems are not solved, such a widespread phenomenon as mine will always exist," he clearly points out his own fate, and he points out not only his individual fate, but the fate of everyone. He has truly thought deeply about the problems of society, economy, individuals, and people. I now want to offer him what Tolstoy said, "penetrating the human spirit." This is the place where his art's achievements of today are conceived. Readers probably won't think that I am exaggerating too much, right?</p>
<p>"People all go to pursue their own warmth. Who will care about this withered and broken fallen leaf?" This is the lament he uttered alone on the windy and rainy streets on the third night after he fainted. Is the human world so cold today? I write this short article with shame, as a little warmth that I send to this artist.</p>
<h3>Selling Melon Seeds (Woodcut)</h3>
<p>— Written by A Man</p>
<h3>A Waitress's Words</h3>
<p>— Bo Xin</p>
<p>Following the needs of the environment, the restaurant and catering industry is flourishing like bamboo shoots after the rain, adorning the prosperity of Shanghai. In addition to making magnificent decorations to eateries, capitalists have also recruited young and beautiful women to use as a lure. Pitiable us, under the lash of life's whip, we must painfully sacrifice our beauty, and fall into the pain of muddy waters.</p>
<p>When we have just obtained a job, a pure heart is exceptionally delighted, believing we can now use our labor to resolve a life of hardship. Yet, when we report for work, our superiors order us to cover our faces with powder, and the clothing is a set of colorful garments custom-made by the authorities for a fixed price. We have lost our pure hearts, and our innocent and guileless visages. They want us to put on a charming smile. Yet that kind of unnatural smile is truly pitiful, while it cannot conceal the sorrow in our hearts. Most of us need to bear the livelihood of our families, and it is only because our family members are out of work that we step into this abyss. Yet with an income of a few hundred dollars a month, in this era of daily climbing living expenses, it is already greatly strained to maintain a family's expenses, not to mention that we also have to buy luxurious consumer goods, face powder, ornaments and so on to adorn our appearance. Thus, with thirteen hours of labor per day, we can at best meet our basic needs, but material enjoyment is out of the question, and the spiritual harm is also very deep. We have endured insults and mockery, and we have not received any sympathy or comfort. If we encounter people who suck people's blood," they will make impolite and frivolous gestures, and if there is any negligence, we will be subjected to insults, while at the same time, the superiors will also charge you with inadequate service, and you might even lose your job. We are all human beings, so why should we suffer all this cruel treatment? We have even been given the nickname "glass cup," and people believe that we waitresses are not innocent women. Yet, our sincerely-seeking, upward-striving red heart can in no way be destroyed. We use what scant free time we have to constantly study. Although life has deprived us of the right to education that young people should enjoy, we are determined to struggle, and we will not compromise with the bad environment. In this turbulent era, we must summon our courage to meet the difficulties ahead. Temporary setbacks are not surprising. We are temporarily scorned by the general public! A group, but we believe that there will definitely be a day when we can hold our heads high, and everyone will be equal. Although we live a sad life, we hug our quilts and weep when people are quiet and the night is deep, but we do not despair, and we cannot be slaves for the rest of our lives. We want to learn from life, and constantly learn. Although we are lower-level workers, we do not have selfish hearts. We are not like those well-dressed hypocrites, who have no sympathy at all. After only thinking about profit, they squander money like dirt, and flaunt their power and prestige, showing off in front of us. Yet, we are unwilling to accept ill-intentioned gifts, and at the same time, we refuse to gain without labor. We must strive to break free from the shackles of life, and pursue a bright new life!</p>
<h3>In the Same Boat Through Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>— A Family of Enemies</p>
<p>Old Mrs. Chen lay on the rattan chair, crying out loud. Wei Cheng and Huang Long were both stunned and said, "What's wrong? Who passed away?" Wei Cheng asked the old nanny. The old nanny, while serving her old mistress, said that our master died in Shanghai on such and such a date.</p>
<p>Old Mrs. Chen, upon hearing the discussion about the Cheng family, thought of the death of her own son; Wei Cheng and Huang Long, upon seeing Old Mrs. Chen's tears, immediately thought about who Old Mrs. Chen's son was. How could this overseas Chinese person die? We kept Old Mrs. Chen company in sadness, and the room suddenly became silent. In the silence, Old Mrs. Chen said with a sobbing voice, "Young Master Ye, why are you thinking of coming here? Are you here to see my grandsons and granddaughters? After their father died, they wore black gauze on their arms and came back to Shuangqiao once. I asked them what they were doing wearing that thing, and they even said it was to commemorate a friend. They treated their biological father as a friend and kept me in the dark. Young Master Ye, think about it, is it painful enough?" Wei Cheng said, "How did you know later, great aunt?" Old Mrs. Chen said, "Later, I wrote a letter to Shanghai, asking my son, grandsons, and granddaughters to come back for the New Year, and I wanted to hire carpenters, painters, and plasterers to tidy up their rooms for them. This old mama advised me not to, saying that the old master, young masters, and young ladies would not be coming back.</p>
<p>I heard something fishy in her words, and I eventually found out the truth. Now, now..." Old Mrs. Chen gasped. Wei Cheng didn't dare to interrupt her, and listened to her continue, "Now I have written another letter, my son will never come back, and I don't know if my grandsons and granddaughters will come back." Wei Cheng and Huang Long sighed.</p>
<p>But Wei Cheng didn't forget the original intention of his visit and said, "Great aunt, then Mr. Chen's spirit should now be returning to Yidun Town, right?" Old Mrs. Chen said, "Young Master Ye, we are not from Yidun Town, and we have never lived in Yidun Town. How could my son's spirit have ever gone to Yidun Town?" Wei Cheng said, "Yes, yes, what time do you plan to hold the funeral? We, as the younger generation, should come and kowtow four times." Old Mrs. Chen said, "He, my son didn't marry a wife, and my daughter didn't marry a son-in-law, so even if we hold a funeral, there won't be many people coming. Why hold a funeral?" Wei Cheng then made some other polite remarks and bid farewell with Huang Long. Old Mrs. Chen also asked Wei Cheng where he lived. Wei Cheng thought that it wouldn't matter if he told her, so he said that he was staying at the Wang Shun Xing Inn. Once outside, Huang Long couldn't help but say, "Didn't you hear her? First she admitted to living in Yidun Town, and then she denied it. This must be that the Chen family is actually the Cheng family." Wei Cheng quickly grabbed his hand, preventing him from speaking.</p>

<h3>Malaya Defeat Retrospective (5)</h3>
<p>— Former British Army Commander in Malaya, General Percival's Memoirs</p>
<p>(1) Placing a brigade of the Indian 9th Division at Gurun, and the Australian troops at Ayer Hitam, making a brigade of the Indian 9th Division in the Lengaam area a reserve for the above troops. All these troops were commanded by Major General Gordon Bennett.</p>
<p>(2) Placing the Indian 11th Division on the coast road, with the vanguard at Batu Pahat.</p>
<p>The Australian troops also had a brigade group left in the Mersing area. This brigade group was under the command of the 3rd Indian Army. To reduce air raids on Singapore, the Gurun airfield must not fall into the hands of the Japanese army. The mission of the brigade group was to prolong the battle in that area as much as possible.</p>
<p>Defense of Singapore Island</p>
<p>Before the outbreak of this war, all efforts were concentrated on the coastal protection of Singapore Island, but the northern coast had not been subjected to even the slightest defense work. During the battle, defense facilities were still being carried out successively, but until the time of the attack on Singapore Island, the defense was still not very complete. The deployment of the troops was as follows:</p>
<p>Western area of the island, including Kranji</p>
<p>Northern area including Chiang Chi</p>
<p>Southern area (including Chiang Chi)</p>
<p>The general defense plan was to inflict maximum damage on the attacking troops crossing the Johore Strait, so outposts were deployed along the coast, with several operational strongholds selected within, and many reserves deployed in each stronghold, ready for counter-attacks at any time. If adjacent troops called for help, these many reserves would have to go out to defend.</p>
<p>The Battle of Singapore</p>
<p>Although the Japanese army concentrated its artillery fire on the northeastern part of the island, trying to divert our attention to that direction, our search troops reported that the Japanese army was gathering in the exact opposite area. Therefore, the landing on the northwestern coast was not unexpected. The Australian army and the Malaya Army Headquarters immediately ordered the reserves to be sent to the Tanjung area, and quickly established positions in Senai, Kulai, and between Senai and Skudai.</p>
