<p>瑞典京城五日海通計　　本京昨日降雪、是爲本年之初雪、</p>
<h3>風雲變幻中之非洲　埃及—大戰重心的第二門戶（四）</h3>
<p>蘇丹及非洲東南半壁，旣都在英人掌握中，而西非又散佈着好幾塊屬地，當中僅隔着一槐自由法區，比屬剛果，和葡屬安哥拉；所以要在沿非洲西及西南和東南三邊海岸取得海上供應，只需橫貫自由法區建起一條公路，就可四通八達，直達埃及蘇丹，轉　埃及。所以說蘇丹公路是矣及門戶上的一把重要鑰匙。　其是在地中海上義大利蚊子艇大盛行之後。</p>
<p>至於埃及門戶上的第二把鑰匙蘇彝士河，早已久享盛名，全球婦孺皆知，其重要性也無庸筆者多贅。還是留下一點地位來寫寫這第三把鑰匙的亞歷山大罷。</p>
<p>亞歷山大（有譯爲亞歷山大利亞，亦有稱爲亞歷山大港者。）這個名字熟得很。最近報上關於北非消息，常有亞力山大將軍字樣，這與本文，所提的亞歷山大地名毫無關係；倒是西元前三百多年，那位不可一世的馬基頓王大亞歷山大，與這地名確有直接的因緣。</p>
<p>原來埃及立國算到目前爲止，至少有五千五百年歷史。可是自立國二千多年後，在西元前一千五十年當口，就衰落起來；直到現在，那一片破碎的河山，從未電新收拾完整過，西元前三百卅二年，大亞歷山大到了埃及，他想在埃及找一個適宜地段，建築一個希臘權勢的中心，同時要把馬其頓和尼羅河流域連成一貫，而且還要築成一個穩固的海軍港。找去我來，就在現在的亞歷山大城沿海的一個法羅島上，築下了一個軍站。隨後，亞歷山大的大將托勒密到埃及自立爲王，才把亞歷山大建起一座城來，就算他的都城。</p>
<p>托勒密的王們，在這裏也還延長到二百多年，其後就被羅馬的興國皇帝奧古斯督奪去了。這小小的一座城，在歷史上二千多年以來，見過不少的興廢。羅馬之後，西元六一六年曾被波斯人佔據過一時：到六四〇年又遭到亞拉伯的洗刦佔領；其後又有土耳其的侵入，又有回軍的奪佔，直到一五一七年又由土耳其收回。再後，就是一八〇〇年左右時拿破侖的登陸。第二年又經英人大集海軍，趕來與法軍大火併。雖然，亞歷山大里亞到了一八六三年，就不再稱爲埃及都城了。</p>
<p>亞歷山大雖說經過了如許的興廢，然而二千多年，不曾减却繁華的氣象；因爲這裏不只是一個軍港，同時也是都會，而同時又是地中海有名的商埠。因其如此繁盛，所以也出產過許多風流案件；就中最香艷而膾炙人口的，要算埃及皇后克利奧佩特拉與羅馬該撒大將的一段孽緣。</p>
<p>至於古跡方面，這裏有最著名的亞歷山大神廟，是西元前五十年時的遺跡。現在的亞拉伯公墓，還保留着二千餘年前的潘佩依柱石。在法羅島東端，轟立着四百多呎高的燈塔，是世界七大寄跡之一。此外，在海邊上還有兩座白石尖塔，稱爲「克利奧佩特拉之針」，是風流皇后留下給後人憑弔的一個紀念品。</p>
<p>這座城並不大，據一九三十年調查，人口才有五六十萬。其中本地土人之外，大約五分之一是歐亞各國的僑民。自從西元九六九年興築了開羅，一四九八年好望角又開闢了航綫之後，亞城的商務因之减色不少。但是一八五六年興築鐵道直達開羅以來，又漸漸恢復了昔日的繁榮。英國百分之八十的進出口都在這裏交易。</p>
<p>但亞歷山大所以如此重要，還在軍港方面。這裏的軍港是憑着天然的地形築成，共分內外二港：外港約八九千畝，內港約佔面積三千餘畝。老港是一八七一年所築，到了一九〇六又費了兩年的工程，開拓了二英哩之多。</p>
<p>這裏的地勢，沿海數十里外多有淺灘，而沿岸陸地上則又多峭壁，要想從這裏的海面登陸，頗不容易。</p>
<p>可是德義聯軍是沿里比亞海邊陸地襲來，而阿拉眠前綫距離亞歷山大僅有百餘哩之遙，照理該城情形相當吃緊。雖說英軍發動攻勞已有一個多星期，但據聞這僅是一種試探性的突擊；所以雙方仍在秣馬厲兵，等待一塲血戰。在這種緊張的局面之下，想全世界關心時局的人，都矚目在這一把鑰匙上，要看牠能不能把大戰重心的第二門戶—埃及—牢牢的封鎖着。（本篇完）</p>

<h3>持螯賞菊</h3>
<p>（續）菊是隱士，賞菊必須有悠閑恬靜的心境。陶淵明詩：「採菊東籬下，悠然見南山」。「悠「字眞是神來之筆，非他不能道破。上週承黃園主人惠贈名菊四本，其一名金絡案，花飄一面黃，一面紅。其二梨香，菊有色無香，此是接種，法將菊苗挿入梨枝，花發遂有雅梨香甜之味。其三名墨雲，紫色或大紅，在菊最爲珍異，此則深紫近乎黑色，尤其名貴。其四名十丈珠簾，花瓢細瘦如髮絲，紛然下垂，有弱不禁風之致。李淸照詞云：「簾捲西風，人比黃花瘦，她大約沒有見過此種異品，否則，當不敢輕率下此比喩。</p>
<p>記者居處狹隘，慢說東籬，天井一方都無。這四盆菊花做了案頭淸供，相對日久，覺得菊花頗宜於燈下觀賞，燈光不必强烈，但能照得壁上映出菊影即可，口啣捲烟，默坐其間，靜觀壁上菊影楚楚，饒有八大石濤畫意。回頭對花欣賞一回，偶而一口濃烟，噴向花朶，有烟籠芍藥之妙。</p>
<p>「口之於味，有同嗜焉」！蟹味美，人人愛吃，但愛吃的程度，頗有分別。大抵愛好逾恒或食量過人，可謂之癖。醫如，譚延闓酷嗜魚翅，非此不能下飯；馬相伯喜吃臭乳腐，一日無此，則胃中作惡。嗜蟹最聞名的，近代當推李梅庵（淸道人），有李百蟹之號，他民初在上海賣字，收入大部抵付蟹賬。三馬路小有天閩菜館，他有股份，三年結算，紅利股本一齊化爲妙蟹粉，蟹黃魚翅。據說每次非吃一百隻不能殺饞。至於古人，也不乏其例，畢吏部云：「右手持酒杯，左手持蟹螯，拍浮酒船中，便可了此生」！黃鈞宰金壺戲墨：「蟹味之美，人所同嗜，獨金華陸少葵嗜之尤甚，且食且讚，同人或譏之，少葵曰，吾之嗜蟹猶未也，不及吾師，吾師食已，不盥手，則納諸袖中，曰，留此餘香，以供被窩中噢玩也」。淸朱其恭亦嗜蟹成癖，一日，方啖蟹獨酌，　人以八座來爲報，朱叱云，去！我不以八座易八脚也，大啖如故。</p>
<p>距今十五年前，新世界游藝塲突然覓到一件希世奇珍，名美人蟹，得自寗波海濱，廣吿天花亂墜，不僅眉目如畫，幷且擅做媚眼云云。這一記噱頭較之不久前某戲院的兩頭烏龜高明得多，萬人爭觀，嘖嘖稱奇，券資收入十餘萬。記者那時尙在求學，爲此逃課趕去一開眼界，此蟹養在水盆中，大如銀圓，背紋略具人面五官之影，是否美人，頗難判斷。不過會做媚眼，倒是眞的：原來所謂蟹美人秋波，恰是蟹壳透明部份，蟹在水裏爬行，腹中腑臟也在霎動，依稀看去，謂之做媚眼固無不可，謂之迎風流淚亦無不可！後來不知是有人中傷呢，抑係秘密洩漏，說是假的，用一種化學藥水畫成，入水不褪，如是而已。</p>
<p>同時，記者又在豫園展覽會，見到一個張飛蟹，倒是貨眞價實，係福建沿海所產，離水即死，所以已經製成標本，色黑，大如鬧鐘，背紋眦裂髮戟，宛然袁世海廬花蕩　　。</p>
<p>走筆至此，記起屈原楚辭有「餐秋菊之落英」之句。作家體騐不够，往往鬧成笑話，蓋自古而然！按菊花除經霜而發的特徵外，雖萎不謝，別的花絢爛之後，落英繽紛，惟獨菊花不然。屈原吃菊花鍋，我們無法干涉，但這個「落」字實在欠通，宋閏房秀朱　真詩云：「　可抱向枝上死。不隨黃葉舞秋風。」可見古時的菊花亦未必有落英現象也！</p>
<p>此文寫竟，擱在案頭多時，今日某兄來訪，順手翻閱一遍，臉部表情嚴肅，提筆批了四句：</p>
<p>「持螫賞菊？正當及時；兵荒馬亂，無此雅興。一記者討此沒趣，不禁大爲懊喪，頗欲塞入字紙籠了事，繼念此時此地，閑情逸致的人正還多着，而且文章是自己的好，棄之未免可惜，爰付發表，讀者幸勿譏爲無聊，有厚望焉！（完）</p>

<h3>黄菊花开紫蟹肥</h3>
<p>— 弓</p>
<p>秋高氣爽，黃菊花開紫蟹肥，持螯賞菊，正合其時，可是當此末世，許多人早已沒此閒情逸致。所可能的，街頭看看蟹市，公園看看菊花而已。當我的眼廉接觸到這牢籠中的肥蟹，和盛開的菊花的時候，輒有所感。</p>
<p>蟹，人對之多無好感，有的說牠是無腸公子，有的說牠是橫行介士，於是以此爲藉口，而捕之，縛之，囚之，終於殺而食之，說道：「宜矣」。其實，蟹的無腸是生理，橫行是本能，蟹是不能自主的，並且在動物界中，牠不至無腸到如蜘蛛般自相殘殺，也不至橫行到如臭蟲般侵犯人纇。世問本來有賜而專仿傲無賜，天生直行而僞學習蟹行的，不比蟹更不如麼？所以人們見蟹肉之肥，口饞而食之也就罷了，何必還苛責於蟹呢？</p>
<p>菊，傲霜而放，向稱花中的淸高隱士，可是在現時代裏，淸高則可，如若逃避現實，去做生活而不工作的隱士則不可。菊花已是時代的落伍者，再菊花是以色以香，供人玩賞的，腦滿腸肥的市儈得而玩賞，不辨菽麥的走卒得而玩賞，以至於沒心肝，沒腦子的人也得而玩賞。菊花生在這個光怪陸離的亂世，專事取悅於人，也够不幸與可憐了。</p>
<h3>二十五年</h3>
<p>— 海麟</p>
<p>幽逸的星光，逗留在一個靜謐的夜晚的天空上，岑寂的靜安寺路上，有幾盞孤單的路燈，在柏油路上反映出安靜肅穆的氣息。陣陣悒鬱慵懶的秋風，飄送着蒼茫的寒冷。</p>
<p>戈登路口一家皮貨店的門口，一年四季全放着的一個籐椅上，萎縮着一個完全藏在皮衣裏的羅宋老頭兒，只留出一個飄動着銀鬚的頭，戴着一頂圓邊平頂的哥薩克帽，朦朧地抬頭望望隔壁亨得利掛在外邊的大鐘，已經二點半了，又望望深藍色的天空。無聊地點着一支香烟，空虛地望着飄浮不定的縷烟，象徵着他寂寞悽愴的老年，消失在銀鬚之中。</p>
<p>寒凉的風，把他的淸秀和氣的老臉，送進了溫暖的皮領，殘餘的烟頭，從手上滑落到地上，裊裊的烟雲環繞着他，使他幻想在憧憬之中，他咳嗽了幾聲，抖動的心弦上，奏出他嘹喨英偉的前行曲，他似乎是騎在一匹駿馬之上了。哥薩克的騎士，俄帝尼古拉第二的寵臣，多麼令人羨慕的英雄呀！</p>
<p>記得很淸楚，有一天他逃出了酒店胭脂的包圍，蹓躂在像今天一樣的深夜的街頭，他吸了一口黎明之前淸凉的空氣，全身非常舒適，二隻皮靴的脚，載着他魁偉的身體，走到了俄國皇城的貧民窟！　忽然，他聽見有囁嚅而出的歌聲，天然一富有歌唱本能的沉着和遼遠。他跟着這謳歌走近，那是一個孤單的老頭，骯髒油膩的衣服，與頭髮相接速的鬍鬚，一個典型的俄國老人，在邊歌邊將稻草一梱一梱放上馬車，熟練地，古板地，他禁不住走上去問他：『喂，老先生，一個人嗎？』</p>
<p>『是的，只是一個人，但現在連你有二個人了，年靑的騎士。』有禮貌，但是是勉强的回答。</p>
<p>『這麼晚還在作工，太勤了，也太可憐了，一個孤單單活在世上的老人。』</p>
<p>『不！我不喜歡別人可憐我，你應當贊美我，我年紀不太老，我用手作工，供給我自己的黑麵包，我還很驕傲呢？五十九歲還能養活我自己。』</p>
<p>『那麼請你原諒我，不過我總是不懂，你到底是一個可憐的人，這麼老，而沒有小輩們來養你，讓你休息。想我這麼年靑，還非得有許多侍候的人來供我使喚，替我作工，我才快樂呢？如果讓我自己來作工，那簡直是太苦的事了。那麼請問老先生，你這樣生活，覺得苦麼？』</p>
<p>『苦！你太年靑，不懂得什麼是「苦」，什麼是「樂」，不過我可以吿訴你，我很快樂　你慢慢地會懂得的，再會吧！高貴的年靑人，我還要趕市呢？』老頭的蒼老黝黑的靨孔上，露出神秘的笑，坐上了馬車，搖擺着滯鈍的輪子走遠了。</p>
<p>悵望着遠去的塵士，沉思地走回華麗的宮舍！這是一九一六年的事了，這疑問永遠不曾離開他，一九一七年的革命爆發，他如喪家之犬似的到處流浪了飄盪，他一路上用自己的雙手養活自己，先是非常懊喪，感到悽凉，隨後也慣了，他相信了自己的手的能力。</p>
<p>二十五年以後的現在，一九四二年的上海，他老了，銀白的鬍子，像繁殖極强的野草似的，生長在他的臉上，頭髮白了，身子萎縮了，甚至於生長在西伯利亞冰原上的他，在現在不過是秋季的夜晚，他也要披上了皮衣了。</p>
<p>做皮貨店的司間，已成了白俄的專業，沉着，毅力，安祥，驚醒是他們的特色。</p>
<p>他做夢也不曾想到二十五年以前的貴族，會在現在當着司閣，但他也不曾想到自己也會成了二十五年以前曾談話片刻的孤單的老頭兒</p>
<p>烟的殘燼一熄，他似乎淸醒了一切，看看鐘，已經五點鐘了，他習慣　知道再一會兒天便亮了，一陣寒風吹來，淸醒的他，在追思二十五年前那老者的話的真理。</p>
<p>他覺的有些飢餓，隨手在籐椅下，拿出一塊黑麺包啃着，他突然地明白了。他想「我也五十歲了，但是我能夠以我自己的能力，賺的這黑麵包，養我自己，這的確是值得驕傲的。不然的話，如果革命不發生，那我現在一定是躺在華貴床上，由待者或小輩拿牛奶灌給我吃，像活屍似得等死，那活着又有什麽意味呢？「人」生在世界上本是要奮鬥的呀！我現在到底是還年靑呢？我還有燦爛的活力」我不怕麵包漲價了我還能飽受風霜抵抗這寒凉的長夜，我的手臂還有肌肉，我的血還在沸騰，……我太興奮了，我還是靑年啊！「他跳了起來，哼着哥薩克騎兵的進行曲。他找到「人」生的快樂了</p>
<p>天亮了，太陽溫熹地照耀着大地，熱情地凝視着這羅宋老貴族銀白的鬍鬚和年靑的心</p>
<h3>青年跑出學校</h3>
<p>— 注祖念</p>
<p>在這一個生活困難的現社會裏，能够每天衣食不缺，已經是很不容易了。如果依舊有力量進高中大學去讀書求學，我想誰也不能不承認，他是一個天之驕子」幸運兒了吧。你看，多少靑年想進入最高學府，而迫於金錢，不得不半途輟學就業，只好眼紅着看人家去繼續未完學程。</p>
<p>這樣說來，能跑進高中大學的門不是我們每一個青年所最希望的嗎？</p>
<p>是奇怪的事竟這樣出人意外。許多人沒有錢，不能進去。而有一批公子們，他們有力量進學校去專心研讀，他們無須得愛心於生活，他們却不願意去，甚至於情願把這一學期已繳納的數百元費用白白丟掉，半途脫離學校。</p>
<p>那末，他們爲的是什麼呢？他們跑出學校做什麼事呢？</p>
<p>回答是他們要鑽進商業塲去，好趁大大地撈一票。</p>
<p>這個年頭兒，百物飛漲，凡是手裏有幾個錢，自己做生意的，莫不利市百倍，暴發戶多得簡直驚人。他們中有的是目不識丁者，有的是以前舊式商店中小夥計，學徒。現在却多巳腰纏百萬，腹大便便的富家翁。出入車馬，吃的是高貴餐室，著的是綢緞毛貨。</p>
<p>所謂人生在世，總不外爲名爲利。尤其是一輩講「現實主義」的，他們高喊鈔票至上，享受第一。在這種情形下，試問莘莘學子豈有不被引誘心動之理。他們認爲所以要讀書求學，爲的是將來好做大官，賺大錢。現在旣然有不必文憑，又無須學識，却能够賺大錢的機會，那末，又何必多讀書求學一舉呢？於是乎他們要跑出學校來了。</p>
<p>還記得在小學裏念書的時候，曾經屢次聽先生們講，國父孫總理說：我們應該立志做大事，不要立志做大官。意思是叫我們立志做有益社會國家的事業，不要做魚肉百姓的官吏。</p>
<p>注視一下前面所講的學生們，他們非但不立志做有益社會國家的大事，反而想做與魚肉百姓的官吏同樣爲害民衆的操縱商，大圃戶。</p>
<p>這是一個問題。一個嚴重的學生們的思想問題。</p>
<h3>窮教員送禮</h3>
<p>— 治</p>
<p>從校役手里接過來一張紅紅的柬帖，知道又是一個學生結婚請客柬，果然，映入眼簾的，是小兒或小文某某舉婚禮，恭請光臨等字樣。記起某某者即某年的學生也，承他不棄，還記得有我那麼一個窮敎員，不能不感激他的好意，但我却覺得有點受寵若驚了！</p>
<p>在這樣物價高漲的時候，送禮當然也要增高了，非十元二十元送不出，這却有些爲難了，在我們從敎書而得的薪水，生活還不够維持，弄得前吃後空，要在每個月裏負擔二三個人情，眞有點捉襟見肘，左右爲難了—在其樂融融的結婚人方面，那裏會知道我們做敎師的苦處呢？</p>
<p>記得當我們幼年的時候，對於老師的賀禮，往往在事後璧還的，現在時世不同了，還有誰肯再去行那些舊規矩呢？一般曾經提倡過尊師的人，對於這個問題，有沒有什麼辦法</p>
<h3>籲請新亞圖書館　星期日開放</h3>
<p>編輯先生：圖書館是服務人類文化的機關，它是以服務為職責，而新亞所包含的成份，大都屬於職業青年，富然為職業靑年謀福利。但新亞的開放日期，不同於量才時代（星期日開放星期一休息）我等身居滬東，服務工廠，平日自晨至暮，未能離職，而僅星期日休息，適與該館開放日期相反。因此借還日期之延誤，罰款必所不免，若請假借還，又遭廠方扣去薪資。如此不但精神倍受損失，即物質上蒙受浪費，也屬不貲。當今各方努力推進文化運動，而身負都市文化堡壘六大圖書館之一的新亞，定能俯察無數身受職業束縛的靑年苦衷，予以更改，實不勝幸甚。專此，順請撰安，讀者容貞·陳嘩·文達·乾寳·積盈·謹啟。</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（一〇）　飛來峯</p>
<p>黃龍走到東屋裏，把堆在屋角裏的三四個鏡框抗了過来。維城比一比大小，比原來裝像片的框子，只小得一二分。那就案性把華太太的像片也取出來，換上一樣的框子，同時把玻璃擦乾凈了，繩子也換了新的。翠珍從裏邊走來，笑道：「城弟，你忙茶麼，要明天才請到世德堂上去呢。」黃龍吿訴她，已經換了鏡框，翠珍又笑道：「到明天取下來，不是不會打爛玻璃了嗎？」維城有一件心事蘊藏在肚子裏，看見翠珍笑，只隨和着顯出不自然的笑，當時，把兩個裝置像片的鏡架，安放在桌子上，反而催着黃龍和翠珍去就寢。</p>
<p>維城獨自摸索到先前的寢室裏，點了燈，把捺在壁上的陳國芳像片，和懷裏的程炳像片一比，那就使他悲傷，憤怒，懊喪，溶成了一片。看國芳和程炳，眉宇之間，口輔之間，處處都相肖，這可斷定這程炳便是陳國器陳國芳的父親；便不是父親，陳國器陳國芳，一定全是程炳的私生子。若說程炳是和國器兄妹，也是兄弟兄妹，那年齡便不對。可不明白程炳爲什麼姓程，而國器兄妹爲什麼姓陳。這許多思慮；在維城腦筋裏，轆轤一般轉着，嘴裏便不期然而然的念着。他自己不覺得，黃龍却在掩了進來，把維城冷不防抓住道：「你讓別人去睡覺，你自己呢，倒不想陲覺。啊，這娘兒們是誰，不是陳小姐嗎？我什麼都明白了。你原來在想陳小姐，怪不得你不要翠珍姊了哈哈。」（本節完）二二二）</p>

<h3>North African German-Italian Allied Forces Adopt Flexible Strategy, Moving to Better Positions to Continue Striking Attacking British Forces</h3>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from the capital of Switzerland, dated the 5th: The British Eighth Army launched its fiercest attack yesterday on all positions of General Rommel on the Egyptian front, causing the Axis lines to retreat. According to a report from Cairo, the Axis forces are withdrawing along the coastal slopes to better positions. At the same time, the German Air Force is providing cover for the attacking British Air Force. The details of the battle are not yet known. More detailed news may be available within twelve hours. However, it is reported that the Axis forces have now retreated to one mile west of El Alamein. General Montgomery's attack on the 12th began yesterday morning. The British army concentrated all its forces on the northern flank of Alamein and began its offensive. At the same time, intensive artillery fire had already begun at midnight, bombarding for six hours. According to Berlin sources, the first British attack, without tanks, was repelled with heavy losses. The second attack involved tanks. Berlin also acknowledged the loss of some positions, but called this General Rommel's flexible strategy. With the northern battle being fierce, attacks also began in the south and center of Alamein, led by intense artillery fire and bombing. Cairo claims that the British have advanced past Himemat, but the British are advancing cautiously because General Rommel's armored units have not yet been mobilized, and their direct-fire artillery has also inflicted heavy losses on the British.</p>
<p>A Havas dispatch from Rome, dated the 5th: The General Headquarters announced that yesterday, mixed units of our tanks and infantry engaged in a day-long bloody battle with similar enemy units in the desert area between Alamein and Fuka. After unprecedentedly fierce resistance, the German-Italian Allied forces retreated towards a new line of defense to the west in the evening. The enemy suffered heavy losses in tanks and soldiers, and our side also suffered heavy losses. Axis fighter planes engaged in air battles with enemy planes, shooting down twenty-six enemy planes in the past two days. Italian planes also strafed enemy tank columns with machine guns at low altitude. Enemy planes bombed Tobruk and Benghazi, causing heavy ground damage.</p>
<p>A DNB rapid dispatch from Berlin, dated the 5th: According to responsible military officials here, the British forces in North Africa lost 52 heavy tanks and 25 aircraft yesterday. Only two German planes were lost. Intense fighting took place over Alamein yesterday, with the British suffering heavy losses. After repelling enemy aircraft, German planes attacked British tank columns.</p>
<p>A Havas dispatch from Berlin, dated the 4th: Military figures here recently stated that the commander of the British Eighth Army, General Montgomery, again launched an all-out offensive this morning in the northern sector of the El Alamein area, first subjecting the Axis positions to heavy artillery bombardment for six hours, and then advancing troops from South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, and India. The first attack was repelled because it lacked tank cover, resulting in heavy losses. The second attack, under the cover of tanks, made some progress in certain areas. However, the Axis forces adopted a flexible defense, keeping their armored units in the rear and only using artillery and anti-aircraft guns to bombard the enemy, which proved quite effective. Concentrated artillery fire destroyed eleven British heavy tanks in one hour. German-Italian grenade units were also very effective in attacking British tanks. This morning, the German-Italian Allied forces adopted a new defensive strategy to continue inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. The British forces failed to achieve significant gains and instead lost many tanks and various heavy weapons. However, the war in that area is still ongoing.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Central Political Conference Approved the Restoration of the Confucian Sacrificial Ceremony and Stipulated the Dates for the Spring and Autumn Sacrifices</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing, dated the 5th: The Standing Committee of the Central Political Committee held its 115th meeting on the morning of the 5th. Committee members Chu Minyi and others submitted a proposal requesting the National Government to issue a clear order to restore the Confucian spring and autumn sacrificial ceremonies, and to rename the Chong Sheng Temple as the Temple of Past Sages. The resolution was passed, and it was decided to place the Confucian Temple under the management of the Mausoleum Management Committee, merging the Mausoleum Management Committee and the Confucian Temple Management Committee. Li Shengwu and Lin Baisheng were added as committee members. As for the dates of the sacrificial ceremonies, the spring sacrifice will be held on Qingming Festival, and the autumn sacrifice will be held on September 28th. (Another dispatch) At the 115th meeting of the Central Political Committee on the 5th, the chairman reported the designation of Zhou Fohai, Secretary-General of the Committee; Chen Chunpu, Secretary-General; Luo Junqiang, Deputy Secretary-General; Mei Siping, Director of the Legal System Special Committee; and Chen Junhui, Director of the Economic Special Committee, to also serve as members of the Qualification Review Committee for the Appointment of Special Committees of the Central Political Committee.</p>
<h3>Leadership of British Military Delegation Stationed in Chongqing Changes</h3>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Saigon, dated the 5th: According to official sources in Chongqing, Major General Bruce, the leader of the British military delegation, has been relieved of his post and returned to India on October 30th. Greenslade, the military attache of the British Embassy, was promoted to Major General on the first of this month and has also taken over as the leader of the military delegation.</p>
<h3>Canada Appoints Ambassadors to Chongqing and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon, dated the 4th: According to a dispatch from Ottawa, Canadian Prime Minister King announced on the 4th the appointment of Major General Odlum as Ambassador to Chongqing, and the appointment of Wilgress as Ambassador to the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Shigemitsu Returns to Japan to Meet with Minister Aoki for Talks</h3>
<p>A DNB dispatch from Tokyo, dated the 5th: Japanese Ambassador to China Shigemitsu Kui returned to Japan by plane at the invitation of Aoki of the Greater East Asia Ministry. He arrived at Haneda Airport here at 11:30 this morning. He immediately drove to the official residence of the Minister of Greater East Asia to visit Minister Aoki for important talks. Minister Aoki first explained the establishment and future fundamental policy of the Greater East Asia Ministry. Ambassador Shigemitsu also gave his first report on the situation on the National Government side and discussed general affairs related to China. After lunch with Vice Minister Yamamoto and Usami, Director of the China Affairs Bureau, Minister Aoki plans to separately consult with Ambassador Hosawa stationed in Vietnam and Ambassador Tairaue stationed in Thailand.</p>
<p>A DNB dispatch from Tokyo, dated the 5th: After a meeting with Minister Aoki of the Greater East Asia Ministry, Japanese Ambassador to China Shigemitsu told reporters that the establishment of the Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry requires urgent coordination of various affairs, so he returned to Tokyo. During his stay, he plans to consult with Minister Aoki. Before leaving Nanjing, he strengthened the various institutions of the embassy to make them perfect and effective for new operations. Horiuchi, the minister stationed in Nanjing, and Tajiri, the minister stationed in Shanghai, have both taken office and started working. His affairs will increase further in the future, and he intends to inspect the embassies and offices in various places to ensure consistency. Such affairs are not easy. As for foreign relations, they remain the same as before, and it is just a matter of how to operate the new institution. The Sino-Japanese issue is extremely important, and he very much wants to study it thoroughly.</p>
<h3>Former Japanese Prime Minister Kiyoura Passes Away</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo, dated the 5th: Former Japanese Prime Minister Count Kiyoura Keigo, who had been recuperating at his villa in Atami due to illness, passed away at 4:53 PM today due to old age and weakness, at the age of 93.

<h3>Fierce Fighting Between German and Soviet Forces in Stalingrad and Tuapse</h3>
<p>A Havas dispatch from the capital of Switzerland, dated the 5th:</p>
<p>Fierce fighting is taking place in the Tuapse port area and the Stalingrad area on the Eastern Front. The battle situation in the Alagir area has taken a sharp turn in favor of the German forces. The German High Command has launched a large-scale offensive in the area. According to the latest news, the German-Romanian Allied forces, which have been operating in the Terek Plain since the 2nd of this month, have occupied half of the area between Alagir and the Ordzhonikidze fortress.

However, the Red Army is relying on the tributaries of the Terek River as natural barriers and is bravely resisting, causing the Axis forces to suffer some setbacks in their advance. However, a large German force, assisted by mechanized units, has made significant progress and has crossed the Atai-Ku mountain range, occupying two-thirds of the area between Alagir and the Mamison Pass. The Atai-Ku Pass, which reaches 13,920 feet, is the second highest mountain in the Caucasus (the first highest mountain is Kazbek) and has been captured by German mountain troops. Fighting also broke out for the first time today west of the Kalmyk Desert, especially in the northern part of the Kuma River delta. On the 30th of last month, the Red Army attempted to defeat the resistance of the German forces in the Butnovsk-Palla-Kofany area with a large cavalry force and advanced towards Elista.</p>

<h3>First Snow in Swedish Capital</h3>
<p>A DNB report from the capital of Sweden, dated the 5th: It snowed in the capital yesterday, the first snow of the year.</p>
<h3>Africa in the Changing Winds: Egypt—The Second Gateway to the Center of the War (4)</h3>
<p>Since Sudan and the southeastern half of Africa are both under British control, and West Africa is scattered with several territories, separated only by a strip of free French territory, the Belgian Congo, and Portuguese Angola, to secure maritime supplies along the west, southwest, and southeast coasts of Africa, one only needs to build a highway across the free French territory to connect everything, reaching Egypt and Sudan, and then transferring to Egypt. Therefore, the Sudanese highway is a crucial key to the gateway of Egypt, especially after the proliferation of Italian mosquito boats in the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>As for the second key to the gateway of Egypt, the Suez Canal, its fame has long been established, known to all, and its importance need not be elaborated upon. It is better to leave some space to write about Alexandria, the third key.</p>
<p>Alexandria (sometimes translated as Alexandria, also known as the Port of Alexandria). This name is very familiar. Recent news reports about North Africa often mention General Alexander, which has nothing to do with the place name of Alexandria mentioned in this article. However, the Macedonian King Alexander the Great, who was invincible more than three hundred years before Christ, has a direct connection with this place name.</p>
<p>Originally, the history of Egypt, up to the present, is at least five thousand five hundred years. However, after more than two thousand years of its founding, it began to decline around 1500 BC. Until now, that shattered land has never been completely restored. In 332 BC, Alexander the Great arrived in Egypt. He wanted to find a suitable location in Egypt to build a center of Greek power, while connecting Macedonia and the Nile River basin, and also building a solid naval port. After searching back and forth, he built a military station on the island of Pharos along the coast of what is now the city of Alexandria. Later, Alexander's general Ptolemy went to Egypt and established himself as king, and then built Alexandria into a city, considering it his capital.</p>
<p>The Ptolemaic kings also extended their rule here for more than two hundred years, after which it was seized by the Roman Emperor Augustus. This small city has witnessed many rises and falls in its more than two thousand years of history. After Rome, it was once occupied by the Persians in 616 AD. In 640 AD, it was looted and occupied by the Arabs; later, there were Turkish invasions, and then the regaining of control by returning forces, until 1517 when it was recovered by Turkey. Then came Napoleon's landing around 1800. The following year, the British assembled a large navy and engaged in a major battle with the French forces. Although Alexandria ceased to be the capital of Egypt in 1863.</p>
<p>Although Alexandria has experienced such rises and falls, it has not diminished its prosperity for more than two thousand years, because it is not only a military port but also a metropolis, and at the same time a famous commercial port in the Mediterranean. Because of its prosperity, it has also produced many romantic incidents; the most glamorous and popular of which is the scandalous relationship between the Egyptian Queen Cleopatra and the Roman General Caesar.</p>
<p>As for historical sites, there is the most famous Temple of Alexandria, a relic from 50 BC. The current Arab cemetery still preserves the columns of Pompey from more than two thousand years ago. At the eastern end of the island of Pharos stands a lighthouse more than four hundred feet high, one of the seven wonders of the world. In addition, there are two white stone spires on the seaside, called "Cleopatra's Needles," a souvenir left by the romantic queen for posterity to remember.</p>
<p>This city is not very large. According to a survey in 1930, the population was only about 560,000. Among them, besides the local natives, about one-fifth are expatriates from various European and Asian countries. Since the construction of Cairo in 969 AD, and the opening of the Cape of Good Hope route in 1498, Alexandria's commerce has declined considerably. However, since the construction of the railway directly to Cairo in 1856, it has gradually restored its former prosperity. Eighty percent of Britain's imports and exports are traded here.</p>
<p>But the reason why Alexandria is so important lies in its military port. The military port here is built based on the natural terrain, divided into inner and outer ports: the outer port covers about 8,900 acres, and the inner port occupies an area of more than 3,000 acres. The old port was built in 1871, and in 1906, two years of engineering were spent to expand it by more than two miles.</p>
<p>The terrain here has many shallow beaches dozens of miles offshore, while the land along the coast has many cliffs, making it difficult to land from the sea here.</p>
<p>However, the German-Italian allied forces are attacking along the coast of Libya, and the Alamein front line is only a hundred miles away from Alexandria. In theory, the situation in the city should be quite tense. Although the British army has launched an offensive for more than a week, it is said that this is only a probing attack; therefore, both sides are still preparing for war, waiting for a bloody battle. Under this tense situation, people all over the world who care about the current situation are focusing on this key, to see if it can firmly block the second gateway to the center of the war—Egypt.

<h3>The British are Concentrating a Large Number of Warships in Gibraltar; Forty Giant Aircraft Have Also Arrived, but Most Have Flown to the Mediterranean Sea</h3>

<h3>Key Republican Figure Dewey Elected Governor of New York; Democrats Still Dominate Both Houses; Roosevelt's Policies Unaffected</h3>
<p>New York, 4th (Havas News Agency) - Elections for members of the US Senate and House of Representatives and gubernatorial elections were held yesterday. The preliminary results obtained by the Republican Party are still difficult to estimate at this time. However, political figures here attach great importance to the election of New York State Attorney General Dewey as Governor of New York. They all say that judging from the election of Republican candidates in New York State, it can be known that many Americans do not fully agree with the policies adopted by the government authorities in the war, or may agree to adopt an isolationist attitude after the end of the current war. As far as Dewey himself is concerned, although he has repeatedly declared, "In this war, it is necessary to strive for victory at any cost," he has repeatedly criticized the organization of war industries and demanded that the authorities take effective measures to handle public affairs properly. He also opposes the government's proposed post-war reconstruction plan, because he has always opposed the United States cooperating with other countries in the world to jointly organize a new world after the end of the war. Dewey has always advocated absolute nationalism, so his opponents even claim that Dewey will adopt the path of absolute isolationism, "so that the mistakes of 1919 will be repeated in the future." In addition, after Dewey is elected Governor of New York, he may be a presidential candidate in 1944, so the position of Willkie, who has always been the Republican presidential candidate, will be greatly weakened.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Haitong News Agency) - According to news from Washington, the Republican Party has a considerable advantage in the election of members of the US Congress.

Among the 32 new senators, the Republican Party has won 9 seats and the Democratic Party has won 15 seats. Among the 33 new governors, Republicans occupy 15 seats and Democrats occupy 18 seats. It is expected that the Democratic Party will still maintain its advantage in the House of Representatives. Two-thirds of the senators have not been re-elected, and the Democratic Party will continue to maintain its advantage in the Senate.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Haitong News Agency) - Washington telegram, the provisional results of the US gubernatorial election show that Republicans have been elected in 18 states, and Democrats have been elected in 15 states. In four states, which were previously governed by Democrats, Republicans have now taken over.</p>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Haitong News Agency) - Berlin political figures said that even if the Republican Party wins a major victory in the US gubernatorial election, it will not be enough to change Roosevelt's policies. Roosevelt's mistakes can no longer be corrected by constitutional methods.</p>

<h3>Authorities Adopt Strict Measures; Black Market Rice Prices Drop; Illegal Traders to be Punished</h3>
<p>The English-language *Shanghai Times* reports that, due to effective steps taken by the authorities, rice prices, which had soared to unprecedented levels in the past two weeks, fell back to normal yesterday. The authorities are determined to eliminate all hoarding and profiteering, and will take strict measures to punish all those engaged in illegal trading of essential goods. The French police also arrested rice vendors on Tuesday who were found to be transporting more than two *dou* of rice around the city, in violation of the rules.

<h3>Clean-up of Pickpocketing Campaign Achieves Good Results</h3>

Recently, Lianbao *Baojia* leaders in each district have been busy rushing to complete the application forms and photos of residents, submitting them to the police stations for issuance. Although it rained all day yesterday, the residents who went to get their permits were still coming in an endless stream. However, except for those who are over 60 years old, all other men, women, old and young, must be vaccinated to prevent the spread of smallpox in the coming spring and protect the health of residents.</p>

<h3>A Large Number of Coffins of Poor Families in the City are Transported Out</h3>
<p>"Transported to Ningbo in Two Ships"</p>
<p>Since the Guohua Coffin Transport Department was ordered to evacuate the city's coffins, it has done so 22 times. Two batches of coffins for poor families have also been transported.

<h3>Holding Crabs and Appreciating Chrysanthemums</h3>
<p>(Continued) Chrysanthemums are reclusive gentlemen, and appreciating them requires a leisurely and tranquil state of mind. Tao Yuanming wrote in his poem, "Picking chrysanthemums under the eastern fence, I leisurely see the Southern Mountains." The word "leisurely" is truly a stroke of genius, and no other word can express it. Last week, I received four precious chrysanthemums from the owner of Huangyuan Garden. One is called "Golden Net Case," with one side of the flower yellow and the other red. The second is called "Pear Fragrance." Chrysanthemums have color but no fragrance, so this is grafted. The method is to insert the chrysanthemum seedling into the pear branch, and the flower then has the elegant, sweet taste of pear fragrance. The third is called "Ink Cloud," with purple or dark red colors, which are the most precious and unusual among chrysanthemums. This one is deep purple, almost black, making it especially valuable. The fourth is called "Ten-Foot Pearl Curtain," with petals that are thin and slender like hair, falling down in a profusion, with a delicate, fragile air. Li Qingzhao wrote in her poem, "The wind rolls up the curtain, and the person is thinner than the yellow flower." She probably had not seen this kind of rare species, otherwise, she would not have dared to make this comparison so lightly.</p>
<p>My residence is cramped, and I have no eastern fence, not even a courtyard. These four pots of chrysanthemums are placed on my desk as a simple offering. After facing them for a long time, I find that chrysanthemums are best appreciated under lamplight. The light does not need to be strong, but it should be able to cast the shadow of the chrysanthemums on the wall. With a cigarette in my mouth, I sit silently, watching the chrysanthemum shadows on the wall, which are reminiscent of the paintings of Bada Shanren. I turn back to admire the flowers again, and occasionally blow a puff of thick smoke towards the petals, creating the beauty of smoke enveloping peonies.</p>
<p>"People have the same tastes for flavors!" Crab meat is delicious, and everyone loves to eat it, but the degree of love varies greatly. Generally, those who love it excessively or eat a large amount can be said to have a "癖" (addiction/idiosyncratic hobby). For example, Tan Yankai was addicted to shark fin soup, and could not eat without it. Ma Xiangbo liked to eat stinky tofu, and would feel ill if he did not have it for a day. The most famous crab lover in modern times was Li Meian (Qing Daoren), who was known as "Li Hundred Crabs." He sold his calligraphy in Shanghai during the early Republic of China, and most of his income went to pay for crabs. He had shares in the Xiaoyoutian Min cuisine restaurant on Sanma Road, and after three years of accounting, his dividends and capital were all turned into crab roe powder and shark fin soup. It is said that he had to eat a hundred crabs each time to satisfy his craving. As for the ancients, there were also many examples. Bi Libu said, "With a wine cup in my right hand and a crab claw in my left hand, floating in a wine boat, I can end my life like this!" Huang Junzai wrote in his "Golden Pot Playful Ink," "The taste of crab is loved by everyone, but Lu Shao Kui of Jinhua loves it even more. He eats and praises it, and others ridicule him. Shao Kui said, 'My love for crabs is still not enough, not as much as my teacher. After my teacher eats, he does not wash his hands, but puts them in his sleeves, saying, 'I will keep this remaining fragrance to play with in the quilt.'"" Zhu Qigong of the Qing Dynasty was also addicted to crabs. One day, he was eating crabs and drinking alone when someone came to report that he had been offered the position of "八座" (high-ranking official). Zhu scolded, "Go away! I would not trade eight feet for 八座 (high office)," and continued to eat heartily.</p>
<p>Fifteen years ago, the New World Amusement Park suddenly found a rare treasure, called the "Beauty Crab," which was obtained from the Ningbo coast. The advertisements were exaggerated, saying that not only were its eyebrows and eyes like paintings, but it could also make seductive winks. This gimmick was much more clever than the two-headed turtle in a certain theater not long ago. Tens of thousands of people rushed to see it, exclaiming in wonder. The ticket revenue was more than 100,000. At that time, I was still a student, and I skipped class to go and see it for myself. This crab was kept in a water basin, and was as big as a silver dollar. The patterns on its back vaguely resembled the facial features of a human face. Whether it was a beauty was difficult to judge. However, it could indeed make seductive winks: it turned out that the so-called crab beauty's flirtatious gaze was precisely the transparent part of the crab shell. When the crab crawled in the water, its internal organs also moved slightly. Viewed vaguely, it could be said to be making seductive winks, or it could be said to be shedding tears in the wind! Later, I don't know if someone was slandering it, or if a secret was leaked, saying that it was fake, and was painted with a kind of chemical potion that would not fade in water, and that was all.</p>
<p>At the same time, I also saw a "Zhang Fei Crab" at the Yu Garden exhibition, which was genuine. It was produced on the coast of Fujian, and would die as soon as it left the water, so it had already been made into a specimen. It was black in color, as big as an alarm clock, and the patterns on its back were cracked and disheveled, just like Yuan Shihai in "Luhua Dang".</p>
<p>Writing to this point, I remember that Qu Yuan's "Chu Ci" has a line "eating the fallen petals of autumn chrysanthemums." Writers often make jokes because of insufficient experience, and this has been the case since ancient times! According to the characteristics of chrysanthemums, in addition to blooming after frost, they do not wither even when they are withered. Other flowers fall in a dazzling display after they have bloomed, but chrysanthemums are not like that. We cannot interfere with Qu Yuan's eating chrysanthemum hot pot, but the word "fallen" is really inappropriate. Song Yanfangxiu Zhu 颎zhen wrote in his poem: "菊可抱向枝上死，不隨黃葉舞秋風。(Chrysanthemums can be embraced and die on the branches, not dancing with the yellow leaves in the autumn wind.)" It can be seen that even ancient chrysanthemums may not have had the phenomenon of fallen petals!</p>
<p>This article has been written and placed on my desk for a long time. Today, a friend came to visit and casually flipped through it. His expression was serious, and he wrote four lines:</p>
<p>"Holding stinging crabs and appreciating chrysanthemums? It is exactly the right time; in times of war and chaos, there is no such leisure. A reporter finds this uninteresting, and cannot help but feel very frustrated, and wants to stuff it into the wastebasket. Then he remembers that at this time and place, there are still many people with leisurely moods, and besides, one's own article is good, and it would be a pity to discard it, so he pays it to be published, hoping that the readers will not criticize it for being boring, and has great expectations!" (The End)</p>

<h3>Public Debt Market: Much Struggling</h3>
<p>In yesterday's gray market for public bonds, both buyers and sellers were quite competitive. Buyers wanted to raise prices but lacked the courage, and sellers wanted to lower prices but were not strong enough. Therefore, market prices struggled quite a bit, and market sentiment remained uneasy. Those who entered the market believed that the air was still just air, while those who exited believed that it was inevitable. In general, regulation is inevitable. Everything is already under regulation, so how can public debt be an exception? It is only known how much the degree of regulation will be. At present, buying and selling are still groping in the dark. Yesterday, Class C bonds initially traded at five yuan, then dropped to as low as four yuan, and then rose to as high as five yuan and nine jiao, but ultimately remained at five yuan. The chaotic market conditions are enough to show the anxiety of people's hearts. Before a formal announcement is made, there will still be much volatility in the future. The market price results show that highs and lows differed by only a few jiao. The turnover was about three million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>

<h3>Yellow Chrysanthemums Bloom, Purple Crabs Are Fat</h3>
<p>— Gong (a pen name)</p>
<p>The autumn sky is clear, yellow chrysanthemums are blooming, and purple crabs are fat. Holding crabs and appreciating chrysanthemums is exactly the right thing to do. But in this end of times, many people have long lost this leisure. What is possible is to look at the crab market on the street and look at the chrysanthemums in the park. When my eyes come into contact with the fat crabs in the cage and the blooming chrysanthemums, I often have some feelings.</p>
<p>Most people do not have good feelings towards crabs. Some say that they are "腸公子" (intestine-less gentlemen), and some say that they are "橫行介士" (sideways-walking armored warriors). So, using this as an excuse, they capture them, bind them, imprison them, and finally kill and eat them, saying, "It is right to do so." In fact, a crab's lack of intestines is physiological, and its sideways walking is instinctual. Crabs cannot control themselves. Moreover, in the animal kingdom, they are not so intestine-less as to kill each other like spiders, nor so sideways-walking as to infringe on humans like bedbugs. In this world, there are those who are granted but specially imitate arrogance without being granted, and those who are born to walk straight but falsely learn to walk sideways like crabs. Are they not worse than crabs? Therefore, it is fine if people eat crab meat because they are gluttonous, but why should they be so critical of crabs?</p>
<p>Chrysanthemums, blooming in defiance of frost, have always been called lofty hermits among flowers. But in this modern era, loftiness is fine, but it is not acceptable to escape reality and be a hermit who lives life without working. Chrysanthemums are already outdated. Moreover, chrysanthemums are for people to appreciate for their color and fragrance. The fat-headed, big-bellied merchants can appreciate them, the coolies who cannot distinguish beans from wheat can appreciate them, and even those who have no heart and no brain can appreciate them. Chrysanthemums are born in this strange and chaotic world, and they specialize in pleasing people, which is unfortunate and pitiful enough.</p>
<h3>Twenty-Fifth Year</h3>
<p>— Hai Lin</p>
<p>The secluded starlight lingered in the still night sky. On the silent Jing'an Temple Road, a few lonely streetlights reflected a serene and solemn atmosphere on the asphalt. Gusts of melancholic and languid autumn wind carried a vast coldness.</p>
<p>At the entrance of a fur shop at the Gordon Road intersection, on a wicker chair that was out all year round, a Russian old man, completely shrunken and hidden in a leather coat, only revealing a head with a fluttering silver beard, wearing a round-brimmed, flat-topped Cossack hat, vaguely looked up at the large clock hanging outside Hendry’s next door. It was already half past two. He then looked at the deep blue sky. Bored, he lit a cigarette, emptily watching the drifting smoke, symbolizing his lonely and sorrowful old age, disappearing into his silver beard.</p>
<p>The cold wind blew his refined and gentle old face into the warm leather collar. The remaining cigarette butt slipped from his hand to the ground. Curling smoke surrounded him, making him fantasize in reverie. He coughed a few times, and the strings of his trembling heart played his clear and heroic march, as if he were riding a steed. A Cossack knight, a favored subject of the Russian Emperor Nicholas II, what an enviable hero!</p>
<p>He remembered clearly, one day he escaped the encirclement of rouge in a hotel, strolling on the streets in the deep night just like today. He took a breath of the cool air before dawn, feeling very comfortable all over. His feet in leather boots carried his robust body to the slums of the Russian Imperial city! Suddenly, he heard a murmuring song, naturally rich in composure and distance with singing instinct. He followed the singing closer, and saw a lonely old man, with dirty and greasy clothes, beard connected to his hair, a typical Russian old man, singing while putting bundles of straw onto a carriage, skillfully and mechanically. He couldn't help but go up and ask him, "Hey, old man, are you alone?"</p>
<p>"Yes, just alone, but now there are two of us, young knight." A polite, but reluctant answer.</p>
<p>"Working so late, you're too diligent, and too pitiful, a lonely old man living in the world."</p>
<p>"No! I don't like others pitying me, you should praise me. I'm not too old. I work with my hands and provide my own black bread. I'm still very proud. At fifty-nine, I can still support myself."</p>
<p>"Then please forgive me, but I still don't understand. Are you really a pitiful person, so old, and without younger generations to support you, to let you rest. I'm so young, and I still have so many people serving me, working for me, that's when I'm happy. If I had to work myself, that would be too hard. So, may I ask, old man, do you feel bitter living like this?"</p>
<p>"Bitter! You are too young, you don't understand what 'bitterness' is, what 'joy' is. But I can tell you, I am very happy. You will slowly understand. Goodbye! Noble young man, I still have to rush to the market!" The old man's old, dark cheeks revealed a mysterious smile, and he sat on the carriage, swaying as the sluggish wheels rolled away.</p>
<p>Gazing at the departing dust, he walked back to the magnificent palace in contemplation! This happened in 1916, and this question never left him. The revolution broke out in 1917, and he wandered everywhere like a stray dog. Along the way, he supported himself with his own hands. At first, he was very depressed and felt desolate, but he gradually got used to it. He believed in the ability of his own hands.</p>
<p>Now, twenty-five years later, in 1942 Shanghai, he is old. His silver-white beard, like vigorously growing weeds, grows on his face. His hair is white, his body is shrunken. Even though he grew up on the Siberian ice plains, now, even on autumn nights, he has to put on a leather coat.</p>
<p>Working as a clerk in a fur shop has become a profession for White Russians. Composure, perseverance, serenity, and alertness are their characteristics.</p>
<p>He never dreamed that the aristocrat of twenty-five years ago would now be a clerk, but he also never dreamed that he would become the lonely old man he had a brief conversation with twenty-five years ago.</p>
<p>The embers of the cigarette went out, and he seemed to have become aware of everything. He looked at the clock, it was already five o'clock. He was used to it and knew that it would be dawn soon. A gust of cold wind blew, and the sober him was reflecting on the truth of the old man's words twenty-five years ago.</p>
<p>He felt a little hungry. He casually took out a piece of black bread from under the wicker chair and gnawed on it. He suddenly understood. He thought, "I am also fifty years old, but I can earn this black bread with my own ability and support myself. This is indeed something to be proud of. Otherwise, if the revolution hadn't happened, I would definitely be lying on a luxurious bed now, being force-fed milk by attendants or younger generations, waiting for death like a living corpse. What's the point of living like that? A 'person' is born into the world to struggle! I am still young after all? I still have brilliant vitality!" I am not afraid of bread prices rising. I can still withstand the wind and frost and resist this cold long night. My arms still have muscles, my blood is still boiling... I am too excited, I am still young!" He jumped up, humming the marching song of the Cossack cavalry. He had found the joy of "life"!</p>
<p>Dawn broke, and the sun warmly shone on the earth, passionately gazing at the silver-white beard and young heart of this Russian aristocratic old man.</p>
<h3>### Youths Running Out of School</h3>
<p>— Zhu Zunian</p>
<p>In this current society where life is difficult, it is already not easy to have enough food and clothing every day. If one still has the strength to go to high school or university to study, I think no one can deny that he is a "darling of heaven," a lucky person. You see, how many young people want to enter the highest institutions of learning, but are forced by money to drop out and get a job halfway through, and can only enviously watch others continue their unfinished studies.</p>
<p>That being said, isn't being able to run into the doors of high school and university what every one of our young people most hopes for?</p>
<p>It is a strange thing that happens unexpectedly. Many people don't have money and can't get in. But there is a group of young masters who have the ability to go to school and study diligently, they don't need to worry about life, but they are unwilling to go, and even willing to throw away the hundreds of dollars of fees they have already paid for this semester, dropping out of school halfway.</p>
<p>Then, what are they doing it for? What are they doing outside of school?</p>
<p>The answer is that they want to plunge into the commercial arena in order to make a big fortune.</p>
<p>In this era, everything is soaring in price. Anyone who has some money in their hands and does business themselves is making a hundredfold profit. The number of nouveaux riches is simply astonishing. Some of them are illiterate, and some of them used to be small clerks or apprentices in old-fashioned stores. Now, most of them have millions around their waists and are wealthy men with large bellies. They travel in carriages and horses, eat in expensive restaurants, and wear silk and wool goods.</p>
<p>It is said that life in the world is always about fame and fortune. Especially those who talk about "realism," they shout that money is supreme and enjoyment comes first. In this situation, how can students not be tempted and moved? They believe that the reason they want to study is to become high-ranking officials and make a lot of money in the future. Now that there is an opportunity to make a lot of money without a diploma or knowledge, then why bother reading and studying? So they want to run out of school.</p>
<p>I still remember when I was studying in elementary school, I often heard the teachers say that the Father of the Nation, Sun Yat-sen, said: We should aspire to do great things, not aspire to become high-ranking officials. The meaning is to ask us to aspire to do undertakings that are beneficial to society and the country, not to become officials who prey on the people.</p>
<p>Looking at the students mentioned earlier, they not only do not aspire to do great things that are beneficial to society and the country, but instead want to become manipulators and big bosses who harm the people in the same way as officials who prey on the people.</p>
<p>This is a problem. A serious ideological problem for students.</p>
<h3>### Poor Teacher Giving Gifts</h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>Receiving a red invitation card from the school clerk, I knew it was another wedding invitation from a student. Sure enough, what caught my eye were the words "My son/daughter so-and-so is holding a wedding ceremony, respectfully inviting your presence." I remembered that so-and-so was a student from such-and-such year. I am grateful that he didn't forget me and still remembered that there was a poor teacher like me, but I felt a bit flattered!</p>
<p>In these times of high prices, the gifts must of course also be increased. It's impossible to give less than ten or twenty yuan, which is a bit difficult. The salary we get from teaching is not even enough to maintain our lives, leaving us with empty pockets. Having to bear two or three social obligations every month is really stretching us thin and putting us in a dilemma. How would the happy wedding couple know the suffering of us teachers?</p>
<p>I remember when we were young, the gifts given to teachers were often returned afterwards. Now, times are different. Who would still be willing to follow those old rules? Has anyone who once advocated for respecting teachers have any solutions to this problem?</p>
<h3>### Appeal to Xin Ya Library to Open on Sundays</h3>
<p>Editor: Libraries are institutions that serve human culture, and their duty is to serve. Xin Ya's constituents are mostly working youths, and it naturally seeks to benefit working youths. However, Xin Ya's opening days are different from those of Liangcai Era (open on Sundays, closed on Mondays). We live in Shanghai's east, working in factories, unable to leave our jobs from morning till night, and only have Sundays off, which coincides with the library's closing days. Therefore, delays in borrowing and returning books are inevitable, and fines are unavoidable. If we ask for leave to borrow and return books, we will also have our wages deducted by the factory. In this way, not only is our spirit greatly harmed, but the material waste we suffer is also significant. Today, all parties are working hard to promote the cultural movement, and Xin Ya, one of the six major libraries bearing the cultural fortress of the city, will surely sympathize with the plight of countless young people bound by their occupations and make changes. We would be most fortunate. Respectfully, Rong Zhen, Chen Hua, Wen Da, Gan Bao, Ji Ying, sincerely.</p>
<h3>### Sailing Through Storms Together</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(10) Flying Peak</p>
<p>Huanglong walked into the east room and carried over the three or four mirror frames piled in the corner of the room. Weicheng compared the sizes and found that they were only one or two centimeters smaller than the original frames for the photos. So he replaced the frames of Mrs. Hua's photo with the same frames, while also wiping the glass clean and replacing the ropes with new ones. Cuizhen walked in from inside and smiled, "Brother Cheng, what are you busy with? We're not inviting her to Shide Hall until tomorrow." Huanglong told her that he had already changed the frames, and Cuizhen smiled again, "If you take it down tomorrow, won't you break the glass?" Weicheng had a matter on his mind, and when he saw Cuizhen smiling, he only showed an unnatural smile to appease her. At that time, he placed the two framed photos on the table and urged Huanglong and Cuizhen to go to bed.</p>
<p>Weicheng groped alone to the previous bedroom, turned on the light, and compared the photo of Chen Guofang hanging on the wall with the photo of Cheng Bing in his arms, which filled him with sadness, anger, and frustration. Looking at Guofang and Cheng Bing, between their brows and mouths, they looked alike everywhere, which confirmed that Cheng Bing was Chen Guoqi and Chen Guofang's father; even if he wasn't the father, Chen Guoqi and Chen Guofang must all be Cheng Bing's illegitimate children. If it were said that Cheng Bing was siblings with Guoqi, they would also be siblings, but the age wouldn't match. He couldn't understand why Cheng Bing's surname was Cheng, while Guoqi's surname was Chen. These many thoughts were turning in Weicheng's mind like a pulley, and he inadvertently muttered. He didn't realize it himself, but Huanglong pushed in and suddenly grabbed Weicheng, saying, "You let others go to sleep, but you don't want to sleep yourself. Ah, who is this woman? Isn't it Miss Chen? I understand everything. So you were thinking about Miss Chen, no wonder you don't want Sister Cuizhen haha." (End of this section) (222)</p>
