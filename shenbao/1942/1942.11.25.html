<p>象牙海岸（The　Ivory　Coast）位於非洲唯一的獨立共和國利比里亞與英屬黄金海岸之間，並與法屬幾內亞及法屬蘇丹兩屬地爲鄰。法國對於象牙海岸，雖於一八四二年，即聲明該處爲法國所有，但至一八八二年，始加以佔領。迨至一九三三年一月一日，又將伏爾泰河上游的一部份，併入象牙海岸，故其面積，較前擴大，合計一八〇·八〇二平方英里，一九三五年調查戶口，土人三·八四七·六一三人，歐洲人三·一二四人！其中大半爲法蘭西人，此一屬地的首府原在班熱維爾（Bingerville）後來遷都亞比特祥（Abidjan），但其故都，現仍爲法屬西非洲教育中心，該城學校林立，並有官立學校多所。其課程均以法文爲第一外國語，英文爲第二外國語。象牙海岸也可以說是法屬西非洲中的宙庶之地，不下法屬幾內亞，其主要出產，有花生，玉蜀黍，米，香蕉，鳳梨，及其他各種水菓，並已開始試種可可，一九三五年可可的產量，由四噸（一九〇四至一九〇八年之產量）增加至四三·五六五噸，增加的迅速，令人咋舌。此外，還有棉花及橡膠，也在試種之中，成績殊佳，所以象牙海岸每年的出口，也以椰子可可，咖啡，及木材爲大宗。進口貨物，則以棉織物，煤油酒類，汽車，以及其他金屬品爲主，每年出超，礦產部份，法屬象牙海岸，也有相當蘊藏，除金礦外，尚有製造飛機所必需的錳礦，在國防工業上，頗爲重要。境內交通、公路鐵路，四通八達，甚爲便利。</p>
<p>尼日兩殖民地（The　Colony　Of　The　Niger）位於英屬尼日利（Nigeria）之北，撒哈拉大沙漠之南。此一殖民地係於一九二二年十月十三日法國政府命令成立，其後法國政府又以陶里區與法達區，併入尼日兩殖民地，因此土地擴充，全境面積約有四九九·四二平方英里，人口據一九三七年調查達一·七三三·七〇五书户譜，其中包括歐洲人四五三人，法蘭西人四一二人。此一殖民地，以其土地的肥瘦，可分爲三個區域，北部地瘠民貧，幾乎是一片不毛之地：中部爲森林地帶，遍地叢莽，毒蛇猛獸，出沒其間。此在南部則爲草原，宜於農牧，出產棉花，玉蜀黍，烟草，暨小麥等物。就一般國民經濟生活而諭，人民均以畜牧爲主業，一九三七年調查，境内共有馬六三·三七七匹，牛六八五·六八三頭，羊二·四八三·五八〇頭，驢一五五·三六七頭，駱驼四九·五七五頭。我們研究尼日爾殖属地的農業所以不發達的原因，一言以蔽之，除尼日爾河流域與乍得湖（LJake　Tchad）之外，各地均缺乏雨水。一九三六年的對外貿易出口四九·二二〇·一七二法郎，進口二八·六〇三·三七四法郎。尼日爾殖民地最特別的地方，就是有一種巨蟻，當地的人民，都度着一種營幕的生活，巨蟻往往侵入螢幕，使一股人不能安眠，尤其是初到那裏遊歷的歐洲人，看見了這種巨蟻，就要大驚小怪，退避三舍。</p>
<p>荷美（Dahomey），位於英屬尼日利亞與黄金海岸之間，北與法屬尼日爾殖民地爲鄰，南　幾內亞海灣。法人於一八五一年在該地獲有立足之點，逐漸侵入達荷美王國，至一八九四年始併入法蘭西殖民帝國，海岸僅長七十英里，但向北伸入内地，面積約四一·三〇二平方英里，據一九三五年調查，人口共一·三五一·五一一人，其中有歐洲人九〇九名。以波多諾伏（Porto　Novo）爲首府，亦爲商業中心，境內教育普及，各地均設有大中小各級學校，一九三五年教育經费達一·八〇二·一八五法郎之譜。土人純屬黑種人，在浩海一帶，從事農工，生活安逸。出產以椰子·小麥·玉蜀黍爲大宗，最近試種棉花成績甚佳。南部各省，試種咖啡，也已獲得良好結果，一九三五年進口五六·三三八·六〇七法郎，而其出口則爲五五·四七〇·〇〇〇法郎</p>
<p>基因加爾（Senegal），這是非洲出產花生之地，當地土人，靠了這一條塞內加蘭河横貫其境，大家都種植花生，每年花生出口，達十萬萬鎊以上，花生匪特是一種食物，而且還可以此製成食油，在植物油缺乏的今日，大可重視。此一屬地，他於非洲的西端，北靠摩里塔尼亞，南臨英屬岡比亞（Gambia），面積七七·七三〇平方英里，人口一·六九七·六七一人，其中有歐洲八六·六七一人。那裏的土人·我們稱之爲華洛夫族（Ouolofs），首府係一古城，就是聖路易斯城（St．Louis）於一六五八年即已開埠，爲法屬西非洲的門戶。境內土壤多係沙地，除出產花生而外，並可種植稻及玉蜀黍，但產量不多，一九三五年的對外貿易，進口四六七·三六九·二九一法郎，出口四四一·四五九·七五六法郎。此外，塞內加爾的畜牧業，也相當發達，一九三四年調查，境內計有羊一〇四·〇〇〇頭，牛三五五·〇〇〇頭，驢六〇·〇〇〇頭及馬四〇·〇〇〇四。</p>
<p>至於交通情形，較任何屬地爲發達，其西部極端，有一要港，匪特爲法屬西南非洲總督府所在地，而且也是法國在西非洲唯一的海軍根據地。這就是英美所重視的達加爾港。除有鐵路與首府聖路易斯城相通而外，並有鐵路直達法屬蘇丹首府巴馬科城，該港在地理上雖在塞內加爾屬地之內，但在行政上，並不屬於塞內加爾，超然獨立，自成單位，法人稱之爲「達加爾特區及其附屬地，」關於該港的詳細情形留在下文詳細說明。</p>

<h3 id="c49">怒吼吧，中國！　將重上舞臺了 <a href="#c49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— 白蒂</p>
<p>「怒吼吧中國」這個名字是够興奮的，它是一部生動的劇本，記得在七年前的時候，它曾經轟動一時地在上海演出，爲着這個劇本內容充滿着反帝，反侵略的情調，所以當時通受了公共租界當局的禁演，後來由各方面的疏通，終於在法租界的舊共舞臺上公演，由應雲衛担任導演，袁牧之陳波兒領銜的演出，結果的成績可以說是優美而圓滿的，它給予中國觀衆的印象是深刻的，動人的。</p>
<p>現在，據記者的探詢，這一別七年的怒吼吧中國劇本，將於下月八日起在大光明戲院演出，據聞主持者爲中華民族反英美協會。劇名在多方考慮之下已改爲「江舟泣血記一。主要演員多由電影界話劇界的第一流演員担任，李麗華，石揮也在劇中分任重要的角色，至導演人選已決定請李萍倩和屠光啓負責。又據各方報道，「江舟泣血記」公演之外，還有女星們和歌星的客串歌唱，這幾天大家已開始排演劇本了，預料在最近期間，它可能與觀衆們相見</p>
<p>關於「怒吼吧中國」劇本，前曾由潘孑農譯出，情調生動，塲面偉大，我們正期待它的重上舞臺，這不但是一年來上海劇運上的驚人演出，而是一個劃時代的影劇界人員總集合的奏曲！</p>
<p>怒吼吧！中國，我祝福它的再見有期。</p>
<h3 id="c50">「男女之間」觀感 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— 葉</p>
<p>「男女之間」是一齣喜劇。</p>
<p>題材的現實，與描摹的親切，使「男女之間」得了意外的成功。劇作者利用人類心理的矛盾，與思想的不健全，造成了不少笑料，這些笑料的揷入是那樣的自然與親切。雖然由於劇本故事性的不够，看去似不是一齣大喜劇，但是劇作者對於自己劇本的表現形式，完全着眼於素描與速寫二種表現方法上，所以我以爲它的平淡與質樸，正是劇本的可貴處。</p>
<p>導演喜劇是一件吃力不討好的工作，尤其是這一種喜劇，原因是導演沒有辦法利用演員地位的走動，或是動作的誇張或是利用故事的錯綜複雜的關係，造成一個最高潮。我覺得毛羽的成功，在演員地位的恰到好處，使人起美感，所謂動的美。</p>
<p>也許一個導演的任務，並不祗限於排地位，同時排地位往往又爲觀衆所忽略，因之導演的排地位，大都一例地注意靜的塲面。但是一待演員走動，就會使人覺得生硬與塲與塲之間缺乏聯繫。這一點「男女之間」却沒有這些弊病。</p>
<p>下幕時候的太平淡，缺乏高潮，至少是沒有力量，那是惟一的疵點，這是編劇與導演，應該共同負起的責任。</p>
<p>關於演員我覺得都很好，祗是缺乏一些眞實的情感，自然這是非常籠統的說法。由於篇幅，我的話就止於此。</p>
<h3 id="c51">「雲彩霞」面面觀 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— 洛綠</p>
<p>展開「雲彩霞」的演員表來一看，長長地一行，集藝壇之精銳，爲近來劇壇所罕見，論他的陣容，可說是够堅强的了。論劇情，自然是離事實太遠，這在作者，早已「自白」的聲明過，但有些地方覺得過分地脫離事實了，末一幕的服毒後的唱戲」就是一例，一個人中毒後，再會瘋在地大唱其戲，於情似乎不合，而本來末一幕是一個很緊張悲慘的塲面，却也給它「哼京調兒」而將緊張的氣氛給鬆弛妻下來，一個高潮，就歸於平淡。</p>
<p>「雲彩霞」的全劇演出，最獲成功的一個當推飾琴師王景福的異方了，目第二幕出塲起，直到末一幕止，每二幕的動作，看得觀衆都覺得很適合，而他也處處都能把握住劇中人的個性。</p>
<p>女主角飾雲彩霞的蔣大流，演來雖不能說十分成功，但並未失敗，除了喉嚨有些沙音以致影響到名角風　」之外，共他似乎也無「疵」可求。</p>
<p>男主角的辛愛王臺吉，是一個吃力而不易討好的角色，他英俊雖覺是很英俊，但是還不昨抓住劇中人的個性，台詞說夾像　書，第二幕中，當他到陳家後對衆人訴說到京的情形時，一忽兒走到道邊，一忽兒走到那邊，太覺刻板，叫人看了不舒服。末一幕雲彩霞死在他身邊時，還不够表情。</p>
<p>總括地說一句，這一個「雲彩霞」的戲，雖有幾處未能盡善，但全劇演出，還不使人失望，繼上藝的「大馬戲團」　，値得一看的戲，該向諸位推荐着這部「雲彩霞」了。</p>
<h3 id="c52">無意間看了兩齣好戲（下） <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— 蘇少卿</p>
<p>德威扮高冲演這挑鏵車，很有幾處與別人不同的地方，槍挑兀朮的大耳環，別人是立着挑，德威是衝上去，兩腿懸空的竄蹦起來挑，他這猛勁，眞有泰山壓頂的力量，還有打金國錘將時，打的像風掃落葉一般，忽然將錘將打倒，他很快的亮一個金雞獨立，並且歪斜的架子，速而且穩，可與尚和玉鐵籠山裏一個歪像媲美。我向來不喜歡喊好，此時也忍不住破例喊一聲「好」，也許他知道我要看尚派歪斜的架子，今天看見我在臺下，特地「冒上」，用十二分的力量，來這一手，叫我看看，這是我自己往臉上搽粉，不知猜着沒猜着，但我今天旣然看了他這一個好架式，就是不看鐵籠山，也大爲滿意了。</p>
<p>李多奎的行路訓子　多奎的老旦戲，我有十幾年沒有聽過，如今他是魯殿靈光了，也想好好的聽他一回，今天傅德威的挑鏵車完，便是他的行路訓子，這齣戲不是老旦的重頭，我今天的耳福還不能算好，但他提起嗓子，來幾個高而且長的老旦大腔，不由人不說一聲好，到底是老手兒，總有些眞本領，並不全是朦世而得的虛名，可惜他年紀已入老境，白口，字眼，不能十分淸楚了</p>
<p>下面是李玉芝的能仁寺，大軸子是李宗義的失街亭斬馬謖，我看到城樓二六完，天已不早，便離座回家，我看李宗義年富力强，演黑鬍子的戲，捉放曹一、類，還比較合適，若演這齣食少事繁的諸葛亮戲，况且又是譂派正脾戲的大活，總覺着差一點，爲省筆墨，恕不細表了。</p>

<p>維城又虛與委蛇的和老者父子走了一程，大家分手了。往前走了幾十步，維城往道旁一個蟻墩上坐下來，黃龍也蹲下了，掏出烟捲，兩個人吸着。維城道：「聽那老人家一說，我們簡直不必再上蟻墩鎮去了，所以人生何處不相建　有許多路打算要走的，結果倒是不必走，反過萊說，有的想　走幾步路，結果反而多走了路。」黃龍道：「不上蟻墩鎭，就上雙橋鎭。」維城道：「是的，到那裏，你不必多開口，我常常替你担心。而且逢人只說三分話，你不必喚我維城，我不必喚你黃龍，以防萬一。」黃龍笑的望在地上道：「你說這話，就該自己打耳光，你在那寒窰一般的小茶館裏，不是喚了我黃龍，才給那三分像老板的傢伙，想出我是在觀音堂開茶館的黃龍嗎？」維城也笑道：「這麼說起來，，說實話也有好處，說了蟻墩鎭，也省得我們上蟻墩鎭去。」</p>
<p>兩人站起來，黃龍一指道：「柱雙橋，該從這裏在南。這到是我比你熱的多了。」在路上，維城道：「和炳這人，大概是陰賊險狠的人，他會放火燒了自己的房子，又燒死兩個人。」黃龍道：「那老傢伙沒有說是程炳自己放火。」維城笑道：「他是沒有說，可是我們猜想得出來，不然，不會道樣離奇。」黃龍還待說，維城在他肩膀上一磕，知道後面有人跟上來了。黃龍走的快，在夕陽沒到地平綫下去的時候，他們到了雙橋鎭。他們在路上商量好了，一到雙橋鎭，先找一家客棧歇，一歇脚，吃了晚飯，然後到陳老太太家裏，去問一個迅雷不及掩耳。如果程炳眞是陳老太太兒了，無論如何，會在言語之間神色之間，暴露出來。所以他們一到鎭上，黃龍先向市梢上一家雜糧行裏問道：「這裏有個隆興客棧麽？」這實在是黃龍揑造出來的。行裏夥計道：「隆興客棧沒有，本鎭只有王順典客棧，是第一家了，最大的一家了。（二三八）</p>

Last year, the National Government also joined, thus strengthening the world's anti-communist camp. Currently, China and Japan have joined hands and are moving towards the path of revitalizing Asia. The National Government has resolutely moved to expel the Communist Party, which is eroding China. This is a cause for celebration for the defense of Chinese civilization, for the sake of China, and for the sake of Asia."</p>

<h3 id="e4">General Hata Returns to Nanjing and Makes a Statement <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency telegraph) - The Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Forces in China, in order to understand the military situation and general conditions in the Anhui area, inspected Luzhou, Jiulonggang, Bengbu, and other places before the 19th. It is now known that General Hata returned to Nanjing on the 21st and met with reporters on the 24th to make a statement, the main points of which are as follows: (1) The soldiers in the area are currently working diligently day and night, wholeheartedly striving to carry out security affairs, especially those on the front line, are most remarkable. For example, a security team in a certain area northwest of Guangzhou, with only a dozen men, engaged in prolonged battles with the enemy. When their support troops arrived, they jointly launched an attack, which is one of the best examples. The fact that the National Government's troops along the Huainan line can cooperate with the Japanese army to be responsible for railway security is also quite gratifying. (2) The security in the peaceful areas is gradually being restored. In particular, this year's harvest is abundant, and various materials are extremely plentiful. Therefore, people's livelihood is also very stable. (3) During the inspection of the Huainan Coal Mine, the staff there were able to work hard based on the principle of serving the country through industry, and their spirit was very commendable. The company is very generous in its treatment of the staff, so the staff are also very at ease and happy to engage in the practical work of Sino-Japanese industrial cooperation.</p>

<h3 id="e9">Soviet Offensive in Don River Bend Blocked; Axis Forces Restore Original Positions; Large Number of Soviet Tanks Destroyed <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Haitong News Agency telegraph) - Military sources stated yesterday that the Soviet army launched a major offensive in the Don River bend and the Kalmyk region south of Stalingrad, and once broke through the German defense line. Now, this gap in the defense line has been sealed by the Axis forces. After the Axis counter-attack, a large number of enemy tanks were destroyed, cutting off their connection with the rear. The German and Romanian armies arranged their positions within the first three days of the Soviet offensive as a stronghold for counter-attack. The Soviet army in the Kalmyk region made considerable progress in the first two days of the offensive, taking advantage of its numerical superiority, but the rear transportation lines of its advancing troops were cut off by the German army, so the fuel supply tended to be cut off. The German and Romanian armies launched a counter-attack on Monday, finally driving back the Soviet army between Krasno and Amisk, with more than 50% of the enemy soldiers being killed.</p>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Haitong News Agency telegraph) - Recent reports from the Eastern Front state that the Don River bend and the area south of Stalingrad, where the Soviet army launched a large-scale offensive, are completely under the control of the German and Romanian armies. Although the Soviet army broke into the German defense line at several points, this is an inevitable phenomenon in the initial stages of a major offensive, and Berlin does not attach importance to it. The invading enemy troops will soon be surrounded. Although the Soviet side reported victories, there are no concrete facts to prove it, and it is not credible. No war reports have been received from Duyapurs and Stalingrad last night. The German army in the Terek region is intensifying its encirclement of the enemy army. The Soviet counter-attack south of Nalchik was repelled. The Soviet army also attempted to attack south of Lake Ilmen, but retreated without success.</p>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Haitong News Agency telegraph) - The German positions broken through by the Soviet army on the Seraphimovich front on the Eastern Front were restored yesterday by a flanking attack launched by the Romanian army. A large number of Soviet tanks were intercepted, and their infantry was cut off. In the battle in the Gormark grasslands south of Stalingrad, the Soviet offensive was repelled yesterday by a counter-attack by the German and Romanian allied forces.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Havas News Agency telegraph) - According to recent war news from the Eastern Front, the German army on the Caucasian front again made progress yesterday. The details are as follows: The fighting near Nalchik in the southern region is becoming increasingly fierce. The German and Romanian allied forces repeatedly launched offensives in the foothills, directly attacking the enemy's transportation routes, with considerable success. A large number of enemy motorized units were annihilated en route. Two regiments of our advance troops in the Terak region, after meeting from both sides, surrounded a team of the Red Army, achieving a great victory. The Red Army's several incursions in this area were repelled by our side. The Red Army's repeated attacks south of Stalingrad and in the Don River basin have not been successful and have suffered losses. In the last battle, the Red Army lost 600 officers and soldiers and 25 tanks. In addition, as a result of our aircraft assisting in the battle, 10 enemy tanks and 50 other trucks were destroyed. Although the Red Army disregarded significant losses, they still took the offensive. The Red Army, which was dispersed by our side southeast of Mei Gupu, attacked our mountain ridge position again. Several teams of our army fought fiercely with them with the assistance of aircraft. Afterwards, 200 enemy soldiers were killed by our army, including four political commissars. In addition, our army also occupied two enemy warehouses, with many war horses.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency telegraph) - The first committee meeting of Japan's Greater East Asia Ministry was held at the residence of the Minister of Greater East Asia at 4:30 PM on the 24th. Minister Aoki, Vice-Minister Yamamoto, the heads of various bureaus, and committee members in Tokyo were present. First, Minister Aoki explained the establishment and general policies of the Greater East Asia Ministry. Subsequently, Vice-Minister Yamamoto gave a concrete explanation of the committee member system and its operational guidelines. The most noteworthy aspect of these guidelines is that, due to the nature of the Greater East Asia Ministry, the committee members will be divided into three types based on geographical location, belonging to the China, Manchuria, and Southern Bureaus, respectively, so that they can conduct comprehensive and individual research and investigations on the specialized issues selected by each bureau in the future. Furthermore, in accordance with the purpose of establishing the provincial committee members, a decision was made to actively seek to convey public opinion.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Allied News Agency telegraph) - British and Canadian joint bomber formations attacked the important industrial area of ​​Vatzsizgart in southwestern Germany on the night of the 22nd. Another formation bombed the northern French coast and bombed the ports of Saint-Nazaire and Lorient on the west coast of France on the afternoon of the 23rd. According to the British Air Force authorities, this bombing is the latest large-scale bombing of Germany, but due to the attacks by German fighter planes and anti-aircraft guns, British aircraft seem to have suffered heavy losses.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 24th (Allied News Agency telegraph) - Former US Ambassador to Japan, Grew, said in a speech in Lake City, USA yesterday, "Japan is becoming increasingly powerful. Not only is it equal to the United States, but its latent military strength exceeds that of the United States. Only by matching it with equal or greater strength in material and spirit can it be defeated. If we lose one day in attacking Japan, its inferiority is no different from losing a ship. We are extremely impatient and must not be careless. We must not engage in futile arguments, dispersion, and indecisiveness."</p>

<p>Bern, Switzerland, 23rd (Havas News Agency telegraph) - According to recent news from London, the leader of the British House of Lords, Lord Cranborne, is about to join the wartime cabinet to better implement his duties. In addition, according to official announcements, Sir Stafford Cripps, after being transferred to Minister of Aircraft Production, will also serve as Vice Chairman of the Anti-Submarine Warfare Committee, with Prime Minister Churchill himself serving as Chairman.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 23rd (Havas News Agency telegraph) - The Neue Zürcher Zeitung carried a dispatch from London stating that the British people were deeply surprised by the cabinet reshuffle. Although Sir Stafford Cripps had shown his loyalty to his duties in the wartime cabinet, he was not entirely suitable for the position and often disagreed with Prime Minister Churchill. In recent weeks, Sir Stafford Cripps has been approaching people without political affiliations, sympathizing with the economic and social proposals of people who are neither Labour nor Conservative party members, thus abandoning his traditional party affiliation. He has recently strongly supported the Archbishop of Canterbury's remarks. In short, Cripps' departure from the wartime cabinet and his transfer to Minister of Aircraft Production can be explained as his temporary departure from the political stage, and he will now focus on administrative work. Conservative Party members are very satisfied with Eden's succession to Cripps as Speaker of the House of Commons.</p>
<p>Zurich, 24th (Allied News Agency telegraph) - According to dispatches from London, all the newspapers in London today published news of the British cabinet reshuffle in an important position and added comments. The London Times said that Cripps' transfer to Minister of Aircraft Production will directly participate in the operation, but he has completely no right to speak on the British government's policy guidance. The Manchester Guardian said that Morrison's entry into the cabinet is not surprising, but Cripps' withdrawal from the cabinet is unexpected. As a result, Cripps is likely to eventually step down. As for the fact that Morrison's entry into the cabinet has greatly strengthened the Labour Party's position in the cabinet, and at the same time, because Eden took office as Speaker of the House of Commons, the Conservative Party can also be satisfied. Also, the Daily Express said, "Cranborne was transferred from Colonial Secretary to Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, not directly responsible for administrative duties. Is this a temporary measure because Cranborne will succeed Linlithgow as Governor-General of India?"</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Allied News Agency telegraph) - The German foreign authorities recently expressed their opinions on the reorganization of the British cabinet, saying, "When we consider the experience of Cripps being expelled from the wartime cabinet, we know that Churchill has finally adopted a dictatorial and autocratic approach, and does not allow some signs of opposition or dissenting opinions in the cabinet. After Cripps was expelled, the British government's policies towards India and other colonies have been completely promoted in accordance with the principles of imperialism."</p>
<h3 id="e20">Spain Expresses Determination to Maintain Neutrality; National Executive Committee of Falange Reorganized <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Madrid, 24th (Allied News Agency) - Since the Allied forces of Britain and the United States invaded French North Africa, Spain's movements have attracted considerable attention worldwide. Now that the North African war has passed its tenth day, judging from the current situation in Spain, despite this extraordinary period, its neutral stance has not undergone drastic changes. There are two reasons for this: Spain's national strength has recovered, but if it were to participate in the war, it would lack adequate preparation in terms of both morale and materials. Britain and the United States are using Spain and Portugal as bases for their strategies against Europe, adopting a friendly diplomacy towards various countries, just as they used to treat France. Furthermore, there is much speculation about the new mobilization plan announced by the Spanish government on the 19th, with various opinions differing. Observers here believe that this mobilization by the Spanish government is a defensive measure that does not hinder neutrality. This is because part of the Allied forces of Britain and the United States has already invaded Spanish Morocco, and 300 people have been arrested, and Allied aircraft have landed in Spanish territory. According to reliable sources, Spain and Portugal will take advantage of this situation to issue another statement, reaffirming their neutrality. It is generally believed that the Spanish government will consistently adhere to its neutrality policy.</p>
<p>Madrid, 23rd (Havas) - Head of State Franco today issued an order to revise the organization of the National Executive Committee of the Falange as follows: The number of executive committee members is set at 116; General Franco will serve as the Chairman and Secretary-General of the Falange; in addition to Head of State Franco himself, the executive committee members will include the Speaker of the House of Representatives, all cabinet members, ten army generals, two naval generals, and several other senior military officers.</p>

<p>The Ivory Coast is located between Liberia, the only independent republic in Africa, and the British Gold Coast, and borders French Guinea and French Sudan. Although France declared the area to be French territory as early as 1842, it was not until 1882 that it occupied it. On January 1, 1933, part of the upper Volta River was incorporated into the Ivory Coast, thus expanding its area to a total of 180,802 square miles. According to a 1935 census, there were 3,847,613 natives and 3,124 Europeans, most of whom were French. The capital of this territory was originally in Bingerville but was later moved to Abidjan, but the former capital is still the educational center of French West Africa, with many schools, including numerous government-run schools. The curriculum prioritizes French as the first foreign language and English as the second. The Ivory Coast can also be said to be the most fertile land in French West Africa, not inferior to French Guinea. Its main products include peanuts, corn, rice, bananas, pineapples, and various other fruits, and cocoa has begun to be cultivated experimentally. The yield of cocoa increased from four tons (the yield from 1904 to 1908) to 43,565 tons in 1935, a staggering increase. In addition, cotton and rubber are also being cultivated experimentally, with excellent results. Therefore, the Ivory Coast's annual exports are mainly coconuts, cocoa, coffee, and timber. Imports consist mainly of cotton fabrics, kerosene, liquors, automobiles, and other metal products. Each year, there is a surplus of exports. In terms of minerals, French Ivory Coast also has considerable reserves. In addition to gold mines, there are also manganese mines necessary for the manufacture of aircraft, which are very important for national defense industries. The territory's transportation, highways, and railways are well-developed and very convenient.</p>
<p>The Colony of the Niger is located north of British Nigeria and south of the Sahara Desert. This colony was established by order of the French government on October 13, 1922. Later, the French government incorporated the regions of Toureg and Fada into the Niger Colony, thus expanding the land. The total area is approximately 499,42 square miles, and the population, according to a 1937 survey, reached 1,733,705, including 453 Europeans, of whom 412 were French. This colony can be divided into three regions based on the fertility of the land. The northern part is barren and impoverished, almost a desolate area. The central part is a forest zone, covered in dense thickets, where poisonous snakes and fierce beasts roam. The southern part is grassland, suitable for agriculture and animal husbandry, producing cotton, corn, tobacco, and wheat. Generally speaking, the people's economic life is mainly based on animal husbandry. A 1937 survey showed that there were 63,377 horses, 685,683 cattle, 2,483,580 sheep, 155,367 donkeys, and 49,575 camels. When we study the reasons for the undeveloped agriculture in the Niger colony, we can summarize it in one sentence: except for the Niger River basin and Lake Chad, there is a lack of rainfall in all areas. In 1936, foreign trade exports amounted to 49,220,172 francs, and imports amounted to 28,603,374 francs. The most peculiar thing about the Niger colony is the existence of giant ants. The local people live a tent-like existence. The giant ants often invade the tents, preventing people from sleeping peacefully, especially the Europeans who travel there for the first time, who are alarmed and retreat at the sight of these giant ants.</p>
<p>Dahomey is located between British Nigeria and the Gold Coast, bordered to the north by the French Niger Colony, and to the south by the Gulf of Guinea. The French gained a foothold in the area in 1851 and gradually invaded the Kingdom of Dahomey, which was incorporated into the French colonial empire in 1894. The coastline is only 70 miles long, but it extends northward into the interior, covering an area of approximately 41,302 square miles. According to a 1935 survey, the population totaled 1,351,511, including 909 Europeans. Porto-Novo is the capital and also a commercial center. Education is widespread throughout the territory, with schools of all levels established in various locations. In 1935, education expenses amounted to 1,802,185 francs. The natives are purely black, engaged in agricultural work in the coastal areas, living comfortably. The main products are coconuts, wheat, and corn. Recently, the experimental cultivation of cotton has yielded excellent results. In the southern provinces, the experimental cultivation of coffee has also achieved good results. In 1935, imports amounted to 56,338,607 francs, while exports amounted to 55,470,000 francs.</p>
<p>Senegal is the land in Africa that produces peanuts. The local natives rely on the Senegal River, which traverses the territory, and everyone grows peanuts. Annual peanut exports reach over 100 million pounds. Peanuts are not only a food item but can also be used to make edible oil, which is of great importance today when there is a shortage of vegetable oil. This territory is located on the western edge of Africa, bordered by Mauritania to the north and British Gambia to the south, covering an area of 77,730 square miles, with a population of 1,697,671, including 86,671 Europeans. The natives there, whom we call the Ouolofs, have a capital that is an ancient city, Saint Louis, which opened in 1658 and serves as the gateway to French West Africa. The soil within the territory is mostly sandy, and in addition to producing peanuts, rice and corn can also be grown, but the yield is not high. In 1935, foreign trade imports amounted to 467,369,291 francs, and exports amounted to 441,459,756 francs. In addition, Senegal's animal husbandry is also quite developed. A 1934 survey showed that there were 104,000 sheep, 355,000 cattle, 60,000 donkeys, and 40,004 horses.</p>
<p>As for transportation, it is more developed than in any other territory. On the western extreme is a key port, which is not only the seat of the Governor-General of French Southwest Africa but also France's only naval base in West Africa. This is the Port of Dakar, which is valued by Britain and the United States. In addition to having a railway connecting it to the capital city of Saint Louis, there is also a railway directly to Bamako, the capital of French Sudan. Although the port is geographically located within the territory of Senegal, administratively it does not belong to Senegal but is independent, forming its own unit. The French call it "The Special Territory of Dakar and its Dependencies." A detailed description of the port will be provided in detail below.</p>

<p>The objectives and foundations of price control in the Shanghai area have recently been agreed upon by the Price Control Committee as follows: (1) Establish an appropriate price based on the prices of essential goods in the economic center, with reference to the prices before the exchange of old and new currencies in May of this year; (2) Reduce coal prices and seek moderate rice prices; (3) In order to expand production, collect inland goods as much as possible, strive to obtain raw materials from North China, Mengjiang, Manchuria, and the South, and prevent the accumulation of goods in various regions; (4) Absorb idle capital and use it for production. In order to realize this, the Price Control Committee will be the center, and various agencies will assist in the process.</p>
<p>Make All Prices Moderate</p>
<p>The above four major guidelines are the main pillars for implementing price controls. The more detailed content can be divided into seven items: (1) Take the prices before the exchange of new and old currencies in May of this year as the target for controlling prices, in order to gradually stabilize them; (2) The Price Control Committee will be the center of price control, guided by relevant agencies, and comprehensively research and plan; (3) Appropriate prices will be temporarily targeted at essential goods in the economic center, agreed upon by private organizations, and then implemented after approval by administrative authorities. Among them, coal prices will be reduced, and rice prices will be adjusted so that other prices can be reduced accordingly. Other expenses such as electricity, transportation, wages, land rent, housing, loan interest, and profits will also be moderated;</p>
<p>Promote Production; Adjust Supply and Demand</p>
<p>(4) Promote the increased production of inland goods and the collection of raw materials from various regions in order to adjust the supply and demand of goods. At the same time, the agencies that handle the allocation of goods will be adjusted, a common price system will be adopted, and the manipulation of the market and speculative trading will be prohibited. Practical and normal measures will be implemented for rice and other essential goods; (5) Regarding the restriction of the movement of important goods, it is strictly forbidden to move them to other areas. As for movement within the jurisdiction, under the control of the authorities, the restrictions will be eased as much as possible, and efforts will be made to avoid accumulation in a certain area. At the same time, the rationalization of transportation will be sought in order to facilitate the smooth exchange of goods; (6) In order to facilitate the smooth implementation of currency policies based on the new legal tender and to expand the circulation of the new legal tender, idle capital will be absorbed and used for production; (7) Regarding the suppression of prices, private groups will be encouraged to take the initiative, and the economic police mechanism will be strengthened;</p>

<p>Stop Selling Above Price This Month; Contracts Already Signed to be Delivered This Month</p>
<p>It is heard that the Shanghai Japanese Cotton Industry Association recently held a temporary meeting at the Japanese Club and decided to fully assist the authorities in maintaining the price limit for cloth. The methods are as follows: (1) The highest price for cloth has been set and will be implemented from December 1st, but new transactions exceeding this highest price will not be conducted in mid-November; (2) Transactions that have already been contracted, if they exceed the highest price, can still be fulfilled according to the contract within November, but not after December; (3) Transactions that have already been contracted that exceed the highest price, if they cannot be completed within November, must be terminated. The principle of termination is that both parties should resolve the matter appropriately by taking a suitable price between the contracted price and the highest price; (4) New transactions will not be conducted for brands for which the highest price has not yet been announced. As for those already contracted, if the delivery date is within November, they can be fulfilled according to the contract; otherwise, they must wait for the announcement of the highest price before delivery, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Reduction in Electricity Fees Not Yet Notified <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Gas Fee Reduction Already Confirmed</p>
<p>The English "Shanghai Times" reported that gas fees in the Public Concession and the French Concession will be reduced by 11% from December 1st. This has recently been confirmed by Mr. Tajima, Assistant Secretary of the Shanghai Gas Company. However, personnel from the Shanghai Power Company said that they had not received notification from the management company (Central China Water and Electricity Company) to reduce electricity fees from next month. In addition, when reporters asked Mr. Ducles, Manager of the Shanghai French Electricity Company, about the reduction of electricity fees in the French Concession, he replied that he could not comment on this matter at all. The electricity and power fees in the French Concession all depend on the price charged by the Shanghai Power Company to the French Company. The Shanghai Power Company supplies 90% to 95% of the electricity consumed in the French Concession. If the Shanghai Power Company reduces electricity fees, the users in the French Concession will naturally benefit greatly.</p>

Goods transported from Shanghai to Singapore include soap, matches, cotton cloth, silk, etc. At the same time, raw materials needed by Shanghai, such as oil and rubber, will be transported from Singapore to Shanghai.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 24th of this month, a Chinese man was carrying a leather bag containing $15,000 in cash and foreign currency on Edward Road and boarded a public bus. On the way, he discovered that a passenger in an adjacent seat had slashed his leather bag. He immediately pointed out the thief and notified the ticket seller. When the bus reached the intersection of Avenue Foch and Route Say Zo Se, two Chinese passengers in the bus asked the ticket seller to open the door to let them off. When the ticket seller refused, the two men beat the ticket seller, forcibly opened the door, and got off the bus. The thief also took the opportunity to escape. The police station received a report after the incident and is currently investigating.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Yü Mao Official Salt Company Plans to Grant Salt Based on Baojia Areas; Authorities in Both Concessions Have Not Approved This <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The English "Shanghai Times" reports that just hours after the Yü Mao Official Salt Company officially announced that salt would be distributed per capita starting December 1st, salt merchants in both concessions considered it a rare commodity and only sold small quantities of salt, with prices already much higher than before.</p>
<p>Monopoly Started Before Implementation</p>
<p>Large shops in both concessions continued to sell salt on the 23rd, while small food stores refused to sell salt unless customers were willing to pay a high price. Many small shops are preparing to sell salt in one-yuan packages according to the official price limit. According to shop owners, if there is no effective rationing method for salt, the lines of citizens waiting to buy salt in front of salt shops may be even longer than the lines for buying sugar, because salt is an absolute necessity for every household, while sugar can be regarded as a semi-luxury item. As economic experts predicted, a man-made shortage of salt occurred after the per capita salt distribution was announced on Sunday. This was caused by salt merchants taking the opportunity to hoard and the anxiety of small citizens who feared a salt shortage, leading to a rush to buy.</p>
<p>Salt Shops and Restaurants Registering</p>
<p>At the same time, all salt shops and restaurants in the city registered yesterday in order to receive the salt to be allocated on December 1st. Two application forms must be filled out during registration, one guaranteeing that the shop owner is a genuine merchant and the other detailing the monthly sales or consumption of salt. It is heard that the distribution of salt will be implemented according to the Baojia area, calculating the total number of residents in each Baojia area and distributing salt at a rate of 0.5 kg or 17 ounces per capita. Salt shops in each area will receive salt in proportion to their past sales volume to meet the needs of the residents in that Baojia area and avoid the phenomenon of queuing. Residents can only purchase salt at salt shops in their residential area. According to officials from the Public Works Bureau and the French Municipal Council, the per capita salt distribution plan was initiated by Chinese shops and has not been approved by the two bureaus.</p>
<p>Free Purchase of Salt Not Restricted</p>
<p>Twenty-First Century News Agency Shanghai reports that according to the person in charge of Yü Mao Official Salt Company, the distribution of salt in the two concessions will be based on the actual monthly sales volume of salt in each sub-salt shop (including breweries and soy sauce shops) and distributed within that area to ensure that the distribution of salt is equal. Therefore, the rumor that per capita salt distribution will be implemented next month is a misunderstanding. At the same time, private salt vendors are deliberately spreading rumors in an attempt to take the opportunity to raise prices and dump their products for profit, creating a tense situation. However, the city's salt reserves are sufficient, and the supply is abundant, so there is no need to implement per capita salt distribution. Citizens can still buy and use salt freely without restrictions.</p>

<p>Coal and Salt in Surplus</p>
<p>According to the English "Shanghai Times," Chang Zhou of North China lifted restrictions on the transportation of agricultural products from the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, as well as the three cities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Qingdao, on the 5th of this month. The authorities took this measure to adjust the supply and demand of agricultural products. Before the lifting order was issued, the prices of agricultural products in various parts of North China were rising sharply. Beijing millet was as high as 70 yuan (joint currency) per load, corn was 44 yuan, sorghum was 39 yuan, and soybeans were 60 yuan. In addition, coal and salt were in surplus. The official price of coal was 32 yuan per ton, and salt was sold for 16.9 cents per kilogram.</p>

<p>Since rickshaws and vehicles in the concessions have been able to directly enter the South City, the traffic between the South City and the concessions has become more convenient. Passengers do not need to get off the vehicles and bypass when passing through the iron gate. In order to ensure the security and stability of the South City, the Municipal Police Headquarters has ordered the three police stations of the South City and the Yimiao to pay attention to the passengers on the vehicles at any time when the rickshaws pass through the iron gate of the French Concession to enter the South City. If there is anything suspicious, they should order them to get off the vehicle and search them thoroughly. They must implement this and not make mistakes.</p>

<p>Forcing Bundling Sales of Soy Sauce and Salt is Illegal; Report It</p>
<p>Recently, although the edible oil wholesalers have actively adjusted the supply situation for the serious edible oil situation, it does not seem to be stabilizing. The retail situation is still congested, and there has been no relaxation to date. The price gouging events by various oil shops in the city continue to occur, especially in the Nanshi district. Oil shops in Houjiabang Road and Fangbang Road in the district are using the excuse that they have to bundle sales of soy sauce or salt in order to buy half a catty of oil, otherwise they refuse to sell. The quantity of soy sauce and salt is reduced by more than half compared to the past. According to the person in charge of the edible oil wholesalers, this disguised price increase and forced bundling of soy sauce and salt is illegal. It is hoped that citizens in the city will cooperate closely with the wholesalers and report any such incidents to the wholesalers for joint suppression.</p>

<p>The public bond gray market still showed no signs of recovery yesterday. Selling by the financial sector seemed to be nearing its end, but public confidence remained uninspired. The tightness of credit was evident. The environment seemed to have eased slightly, but heavy selling pressure in the market indicated that public sentiment was still surrounded by uncertainty. Yesterday's news of the reorganization of the Securities Exchange further weakened public confidence, causing instability in the bond market. Yesterday, Class C bonds opened at 57 yuan, reaching a high of 7.6 jiao, but due to persistent selling pressure, they retreated back to 7 yuan and even dipped to 6 yuan, with a low price of 55.8 jiao. The final price was 6.8 jiao. Class A bonds reached a high of 5.5 jiao and closed at 4.5 jiao. Class B bonds were at 53.5 jiao, with a low price of 2.8 jiao and a final price of 3 jiao. Class D bonds were at 2.5 jiao, with a low price of 1.2 jiao and a final price of 1.6 jiao. Class E bonds reached a high of 3.8 jiao, with a low price of 2.5 jiao and a final price of 2.8 jiao. All bonds continued to fall by 1.3 to 4 jiao, with Class A bonds falling the most, by 3.5 jiao. Trading volume was approximately 2.2 million yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Public Utility Stocks Surprisingly Lead the Way <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's market situation for Chinese merchant stocks saw a decline followed by a slight rebound around 11 o'clock. This was likely due to excessive declines in recent days, combined with rumors of interventions, which created a psychological effect. However, public sentiment remained unsettled. Ultimately, all stock prices declined uniformly, even the public utility sector, which had uniquely bucked the trend the day before, saw a retreat and took the lead in the decline. Zhabei Water &amp; Electricity fell from 51.5 yuan to a low of 49.5 yuan, eventually closing at 50 yuan, a slight recovery of 2 yuan. Regardless of the state of the water and electricity industry itself, there has been no dividend distribution to shareholders, so a little benefit may be expected to alleviate their hunger and thirst. Even if this isn't the case, half a loaf is better than none. In reality, this is still wishful thinking on the part of stockholders. Huadian's share capital is of little significance, merely following Zhabei's lead. Yesterday, it also fell to around 35 yuan, down by 5 jiao. Great China Match once fell to 289 yuan, eventually closing at 292.5 yuan, up by 2.5 yuan. Pufoyang Tobacco also fell slightly by 5 yuan to 105-6 yuan. Cultural industries like Commercial Press and Zhonghua, suffering from oversupply, fell by 10 yuan. Department stores also experienced significant declines, with National Goods Company falling below 120 yuan, down by 5 yuan. Wing On and Sincere Company both fell by 2.5 yuan. Underwear and Kelly Department Store prices were more stable. In the textile industry, Wing On Textile fell to 1735 yuan, down by 40 yuan. Wuhe Weaving rose to 240 yuan with trading activity. Great China Weaving, with small denomination shares, once fell to 9 yuan, later recovering to 9.75 yuan with buyers, a rebound of half a yuan. Shanghai Cotton Weaving rose by 5 jiao to 12 yuan. Hongsheng, Daguangming, Yiyuan, Ningbo, and Fourth Weaving remained sluggish. New pharmaceutical stocks fluctuated, with Xin Ya closing at 50 yuan, Zhongfa at 98 yuan, and Minyi at 85 yuan, down by 1 to 3 yuan. Sino-French also fell to 455 yuan. Financial stocks, which have long suffered from high demand and low supply, saw some activity, with Guohua Bank at 155 yuan, Zhongnan at 260 yuan, and Kangyuan Canned Goods falling by another yuan, closing at 51 yuan. Considering the premium shares, it is only one yuan higher, indicating a general lack of interest among investors. Transaction days are rare. Today's report is listed below.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the gold jewelry market of Shanghai, Da Xin and other jewelers continued to post a selling price of 2,750 yuan per tael (with a reduction of approximately 300 yuan for buying in). There was no official market activity, with prices remaining between 2,660 and 80 yuan, the same as the previous day. Trading was sparse. The price of ornamental silver remained at 14 yuan per tael, with inter-dealer trading at 13.35 yuan, a slight increase. Yesterday's overnight loan interest rate from the Money Trade Association was 1.4 jiao, with no change.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw stable Japanese military scrip. The inter-dealer price remained between 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, 4 li and 6 li. Banks and small money shops quoted buying and selling prices of 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 9 fen and 6 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e47">New Foreign Silver Dollars and Ingots Still Face Difficult Sales <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's market remained quiet and inactive. Market activity relied solely on sporadic buying and selling by speculators. Wholesale transactions were insignificant. Merchants had long ceased dealing in various types of new foreign silver dollars and ingots, and street sales were also sluggish. While dealers holding inventory may have been encouraged by low stock levels in Shanghai, they ultimately found it difficult to achieve brisk sales. The market remained stagnant. Yesterday, new foreign silver dollars, new foreign ingots, and new foreign bricks were all priced at 12,000 yuan per ton, with higher prices for mixed types. New triangular iron was quoted at 16,000 yuan per ton, and 40-foot cement steel bars were priced at 10,000 yuan per ton. Foreign silver dollars, ingots, and triangular iron heads were all priced above 10,000 yuan per ton, with higher prices for mixed types.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Common Bitter Apricots Relatively Cheap <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Common bitter apricots were not strongly held by dealers. Several dozen packages were offered yesterday, in relatively dry condition but with some wormholes. The price for red-skinned goods was 500 yuan per batch, a relatively loose price. However, this was due to the lower quality of the goods, not a general price decline.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Business Briefs <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Orchid and Bamboo Branches Continue to Ease: Due to reduced actual sales of orchid and bamboo branches, dealers are eager to sell off their stock quickly, leading to a repeated devaluation and softening prices. Recently, wholesale prices have eased by 10 to 20 yuan. However, prices are still not high, and operating at the quoted price is unlikely to be profitable. Therefore, a rebound in the market is expected in the future.</p>
<p>Black Pepper Weak and Listless: Black pepper has seen little trading recently, leading to a soft and weak market. Wholesale prices have broken the 900 yuan mark. Stockholders are not interested and even intend to sell, causing the market to be listless. Currently, the market price is just above 900 yuan, but there are few buyers, suggesting little hope for improvement in the short term.</p>
<p>High-Quality Red Yeast Rice Becoming Scarce: The source of red yeast rice is gradually drying up, and high-quality goods in the market are even scarcer. Recently, internal medicine and pharmaceutical companies have primarily required high-quality products, so the market for good, thoroughly colored goods is becoming increasingly tight. Current market sales prices have risen by 100 to 200 yuan.</p>
<p>Daily Necessities Market Steadily Firm: Soap and candles are experiencing the most active sales, with rising prices reaching a boiling point. This is due to strong demand from various sources, causing holders of goods to refuse to release them. Firm Brand soap is as high as 420 yuan, Bai Xiangmao soap is 380 yuan, Huang Xiangmao soap is 320 yuan, and Arrow Knife soap is 390 yuan, a sharp increase of 20 to 30 yuan. White Li's Ship Brand candles are 310 yuan, Monk's Hat Brand are 260 yuan, and miscellaneous brands are 210 yuan, all up by about 10 yuan. Matches are also soaring, with Beauty Brand at 2700 yuan, Phoenix Spleen at 2600 yuan, Golden Tripod Brand at 2250 yuan, and miscellaneous brands at 2000 yuan. The trend in pharmaceuticals remains healthy, with Headache Powder trading at 26.5 yuan, Wan Jin You at 28 yuan, Bagua Dan at 24 yuan, Partridge Vegetable at 56.5 yuan, Longhu Ren Dan at 22 yuan, and Invincible Tooth Powder at 10 yuan, all of which have risen compared to previous prices.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains Trading Remains Light: Yesterday's market was mixed, with slight fluctuations. Ten packages of selected green Wu Jiang were traded at 285 yuan, 20 packages of Chongming red sand were priced at 262 yuan, and 30 packages of sand silkworms were priced at 210 yuan. Forty packages of Qingdao sweet potato dried were priced at 190 yuan, and a truckload of Yuanlong soybean cake was priced at 67 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Roar, China! Will Return to the Stage <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Di</p>
<p>The name "Roar, China!" is exciting enough. It's a vivid script. I remember seven years ago, it caused a sensation when it was performed in Shanghai. Because the content of the script was full of anti-imperialist and anti-aggression sentiments, it was banned by the authorities of the Public Concession at the time. Later, through various channels, it was finally performed at the old Gong Wu Stage in the French Concession. Ying Yunwei was the director, and Yuan Muzhi and Chen Boer took the lead roles. The result was excellent and fulfilling. It left a deep and moving impression on Chinese audiences.</p>
<p>Now, according to the reporter's inquiry, this "Roar, China!" script, which has been absent for seven years, will be performed at the Grand Theatre starting on the 8th of next month. It is said that the organizer is the Anti-British and American Association of the Chinese Nation. After much consideration, the name of the play has been changed to "The Blood-Stained Record of Jiang Zhou." The main actors are mostly first-class actors from the film and drama circles. Li Lihua and Shi Hui also play important roles in the play. The director has been decided to be Li Pingqian and Tu Guangkai. According to various reports, in addition to the performance of "The Blood-Stained Record of Jiang Zhou," there will also be guest performances by female stars and singers. Everyone has already started rehearsing the script. It is expected that it may meet the audience in the near future.</p>
<p>The script of "Roar, China!" was previously translated by Pan Zienong. The emotions are vivid, and the scenes are magnificent. We are looking forward to its return to the stage. This is not only a surprising performance in Shanghai's drama scene in the past year, but also a total assembly of film and drama personnel of an epoch-making era!</p>
<p>Roar, China! I wish it a promising reunion.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Thoughts on "Between Men and Women" <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Ye</p>
<p>"Between Men and Women" is a comedy.</p>
<p>The realism of the subject matter and the intimacy of the portrayal have made "Between Men and Women" an unexpected success. The playwright uses the contradictions of human psychology and the unsoundness of thought to create a lot of jokes. The insertion of these jokes is so natural and intimate. Although the script lacks a strong storyline, making it seem not to be a great comedy, the playwright's expression of his script is completely focused on sketching and quick writing, so I think its simplicity and authenticity are the valuable aspects of the script.</p>
<p>Directing a comedy is a thankless job, especially this kind of comedy, because the director has no way to use the actors' position movements, exaggerated actions, or the intricate relationships of the story to create a climax. I think Mao Yu's success lies in the appropriate placement of the actors, which makes people feel beautiful, the so-called beauty of movement.</p>
<p>Perhaps a director's task is not limited to arranging positions, and at the same time, the arrangement of positions is often overlooked by the audience. Therefore, directors usually pay attention to static scenes. But once the actors move, it makes people feel stiff and the scenes lack connection. "Between Men and Women" does not have these shortcomings.</p>
<p>The end of the play is too bland and lacks a climax, or at least it lacks power. This is the only flaw, and it is a responsibility that the playwright and director should share together.</p>
<p>Regarding the actors, I think they are all very good, but they lack some real emotion. Naturally, this is a very general statement. Due to space limitations, my words will end here.</p>
<h3 id="e52">A Comprehensive Look at "Clouds and Rainbows" <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Lü</p>
<p>Looking at the cast list of "Clouds and Rainbows," a long line gathers the elite of the art world, which is rare in the recent drama scene. In terms of its lineup, it can be said to be strong enough. In terms of plot, it is naturally too far from the facts. The author has already "confessed" this in the statement, but some places feel that they are too far removed from the facts. The "singing opera after being poisoned" in the last scene is an example. After being poisoned, a person will sing opera loudly on the ground, which seems inappropriate. The last scene was originally a very tense and tragic scene, but it was "hummed with Beijing tunes," which relaxed the tense atmosphere, and a climax turned into blandness.</p>
<p>The most successful performance of the entire play of "Clouds and Rainbows" is Yi Fang, who plays the qin player Wang Jingfu. From his appearance in the second act to the end of the last act, the audience felt that every movement in the second act was very appropriate, and he was able to grasp the personality of the characters in the play everywhere.</p>
<p>Jiang Daliu, who plays the heroine Yun Caixia, cannot be said to be very successful, but she has not failed. Except for some hoarseness in her throat, which affected her reputation as a "famous actress," there seems to be no "flaw" to be found in her.</p>
<p>Xin'ai Wang Taiji, the male lead, is a difficult and unrewarding role. Although he is very handsome, he has not yet grasped the personality of the characters in the play. His lines sound like storytelling. In the second act, when he arrives at the Chen family and tells everyone about the situation in Beijing, he walks to the side of the road and then to the other side, which is too rigid and makes people uncomfortable. When Yun Caixia dies beside him in the last scene, he does not show enough emotion.</p>
<p>To sum up, although there are a few places in this play "Clouds and Rainbows" that are not perfect, the overall performance does not disappoint. Following the "Great Circus" of Shangyi, it is a play worth watching, and I recommend this "Clouds and Rainbows" to everyone.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Accidentally Saw Two Good Plays (Part Two) <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>Dewe's performance of Gao Chong in "Picking the Halberd Cart" has several points that are different from others. When picking Wu Zhutu's big earrings with his spear, others pick them while standing, but Dewe rushes up and picks them while his legs are suspended in the air. This fierce strength of his truly has the power of Mount Tai pressing down. Also, when he is fighting the Jin Kingdom Hammer General, he hits like the wind sweeping fallen leaves. Suddenly, he knocks the Hammer General down, and he quickly strikes a golden rooster standing on one leg, and the crooked stance is fast and stable, comparable to Shang Heyu's crooked stance in Iron Cage Mountain. I have never liked to shout "Bravo," but at this time, I couldn't help but break the rule and shout "Bravo." Perhaps he knew that I wanted to see Shang's crooked stance, and today he saw me in the audience, so he deliberately "took the risk" and used twelve points of strength to show this move to let me see. This is me putting powder on my own face. I don't know if I guessed right or not, but since I have seen this good stance of his today, I am very satisfied even if I don't see Iron Cage Mountain.</p>
<p>Li Duokui's "Walking and Teaching His Son" Duokui's old woman opera, I haven't heard for more than ten years. Now he is like the last flame of the Lu Temple, and I want to listen to him well once. Today, after Fu Dewei's "Picking the Halberd Cart" is finished, it is his "Walking and Teaching His Son." This play is not an important one for the old woman, so I can't say that I have good fortune today, but when he raises his voice and sings several high and long old woman arias, people can't help but say "Bravo." After all, he is an old master, and he always has some real skills. He is not just getting a false reputation by fooling the world. It is a pity that he is old and his white mouth and words cannot be very clear.</p>
<p>Below is Li Yuzhi's "Nengren Temple," and the main show is Li Zongyi's "Losing Jie Ting and Executing Ma Su." I saw the completion of the two sixes on the city tower, and it was already late, so I left and went home. I think Li Zongyi is young and strong, and it is more suitable for him to play the plays of black-bearded people, such as "Catching and Releasing Cao." If he plays this play of Zhuge Liang, which requires little food and much work, and it is also a big living show of the Zheng Pi school, I always feel that it is a little lacking. To save space, I will not go into details.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Drama Stage Spring and Autumn <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Ren</p>
<p>Following "Red Star Tears," "Zhongzhong" staged "Desire Demon," with Sun Jinglu playing Hua Yueying, another bold and unrestrained style. Chou Quan's role is also very important. This play is a competition of acting skills for the actors and is worth watching.</p>
<p>"New Zhong" has begun rehearsing Qiu Hao's "Autumn Boudoir Complaint," with Gu Han still taking the lead.</p>
<p>The performance of "The Grudge of the Qing Palace" may be problematic. "Yiguang" is currently rushing to rehearse "Sweet Sister," with a wonderful performance by Huang Zongying.</p>
<p>Li Qinian has canceled his plan to go to Paris to perform and is rumored to be going to Nanjing to perform in the next few days.</p>
<p>Lu Ming is scheduled to leave for Tianjin and Beijing at the end of the month to perform.</p>
<p>Yao Ke has resigned as the manager of the Lyceum Theatre, and Ma Jiang will succeed him.</p>

<p>— Xiang Jia Zhi</p>
<p>One One - The Qiu Family</p>
<p>Wei Cheng walked with the old man and his son of the Qiu family for another distance, then they parted ways. After walking dozens of steps forward, Wei Cheng sat down on an anthill by the roadside, and Huang Long also squatted down, took out a cigarette, and the two smoked. Wei Cheng said, "Listening to what the old man said, we don't need to go to Ant Hill Town anymore. So, there are many roads that we plan to take, but in the end, we don't need to take them. Conversely, some people want to walk a few steps, but in the end, they walk more." Huang Long said, "If we don't go to Ant Hill Town, we will go to Double Bridge Town." Wei Cheng said, "Yes, when we get there, you don't have to open your mouth too much. I am always worried about you. And only tell three points of the truth to people. You don't have to call me Wei Cheng, and I don't have to call you Huang Long, just in case." Huang Long laughed and looked at the ground and said, "If you say that, you should slap yourself in the face. In that small tea house like a cold kiln, didn't you call me Huang Long, which made that guy who looked like the boss think that I was Huang Long who runs a tea house in Guanyintang?" Wei Cheng also laughed and said, "In that case, telling the truth also has its benefits. Saying Ant Hill Town saved us from going to Ant Hill Town."</p>
<p>The two stood up, and Huang Long pointed and said, "To go to Double Bridge, we should go south from here. I am much more familiar with this than you." On the road, Wei Cheng said, "He Bing is probably a sinister and treacherous person. He would set fire to his own house and burn two people to death." Huang Long said, "That old guy didn't say that Cheng Bing set the fire himself." Wei Cheng laughed and said, "He didn't say it, but we can guess it, otherwise, it wouldn't be so bizarre." Huang Long was about to say something, when Wei Cheng bumped him on the shoulder, knowing that someone was following them. Huang Long walked fast, and before the setting sun went below the horizon, they arrived at Double Bridge Town. They had discussed on the road that as soon as they arrived at Double Bridge Town, they would first find an inn to rest, rest their feet, eat dinner, and then go to Old Mrs. Chen's house to ask a quick question. If Cheng Bing is really Old Mrs. Chen's son, no matter what, it will be revealed in his words and expressions. So, as soon as they arrived in town, Huang Long first asked a grocery store on the market, "Is there a Longxing Inn here?" This was actually made up by Huang Long. The store clerk said, "There is no Longxing Inn. The only inn in this town is the Wang Shundian Inn, which is the first one and the biggest one. (238)</p>
