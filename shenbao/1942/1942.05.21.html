<p>倫敦二十日路透社電下院今日恢復辯論戰局時、前陸長倍立厦（獨立黨議員）聲稱、英國現有樂觀之感覺、一反二月問前次戰局辯論時之情緒、歐洲方面蘇聯以英勇姿態開始春季攻勢、固予吾人以激勵、然日人現仍前進中、中國獲取聯合各國之援助綫已被截斷、日本巳獲得至少廿五萬協約國士兵之配備、對方挑戰力並未减弱、吾人務須明瞭吾人非對德國單獨交鋒、而係對聯合之軸心國作戰、吾人必須以聯合一致之戰略、以應付對方聯合一致之戰略、至於遠東方面、華維爾將軍之迭次調動是否智舉、頗成問題、華氏先從中東調至印度、繼調任西南太平洋司令、旋復調返印度、而新加坡與緬甸均曾三易其司令、此舉實未能在作戰之軍隊間樹立信念、且有目的游移不定之意、故英本國內部之聯合籌劃、實有改善之必要、邱吉爾支配總參謀部工作之制系、殊不合宜、倍氏繼連及英陸軍缺乏空中協助事稱、蘇聯軍隊以大批史托瑪維克式俯衝轟炸機協助、展開卡柯夫攻勢、德軍則以俯術轟炸機二千架爲輔、在寇爾許半島進攻、遠東方面整個屬地之被佔、非因對方軍隊衆多、實由於採用現代戰術所致、英軍並無此種空中協助、緬甸英軍司令亞力山大將軍乃英陸軍中最幹練將領之一、惟渠在緬境之部衆飲食慎缺、其運輸被摧毀、軍火被炸毀、彼等並會涉渡沼澤、水深齊頸、恒爲蚊蛇所擾、摘生果以果腹、皆因缺乏充分之空中協助、有以致之、戰爭三載之後有此情形、實不堪容忍、倍氏結尾則調、現代之敎訓必須記取云、</p>
<h3>世界唯一和平　誠實里斯本漫話（二）　國際外交人員的兌換所本報特稿</h3>
<p>各國船上的水手們，都在那裏操作的操作，談笑的談笑：而彼此之間，雖說不是怎麽親熱，但是那種擅袖攘臂的情形，担保不至於發生。</p>
<p>再要走到里斯本的郊外飛機塲新特拉SinreaAirdrome那更得叫你吃一大驚；因爲在這烽火連天的世界大戰塲合之下，這個飛機塲上，並排停駐着各國各式的飛機。要是跑到飛機塲的辦公處張張看，就可看到同一佈吿等類的東西，用英，德，法，等五國的文字張貼着。有人要說，像這各國的飛機在各種不同的航綫上飛來飛去，就不怕遭遇敵國的襲擊麼？這是很可放心的；因爲各交戰國，都想維持着一個共同的接觸交通錢；那麽，彼此之間，就可互相探聽些對方的消息。因着這點關係，大家誰也不願幹那種「鴨屎臭式的襲擊，把手無寸鐵的商用飛機，當作敵機來實地戰鬥咧。</p>
<p>里斯本旣是這等一個交戰國和非交戰國混合接觸的塲所，因此城中除了各國的外交使節之外，最活動的就是各種不同國籍的間謀。有的是打　自已國籍的旗號。在各種塲合中替本國刺探消息？有的則是不明國籍的眼錢，幹着職業間謀的勾當，把探取的國際秘密當貨品山售。然而無論是何種間諜，在里斯本是用不着偷偷摸摸，鬼鬼祟祟的；相反的，他們甚至都願掛出幌子來以廣招徠，爲的是便於吸收各種有價値的消息。</p>
<p>當然也不能一槪而論，那最高層正式的重要間諜，仍舊不願山頭露面；他們不是什麽科學傳士，便是什麽子爵侯爵，或是名妓，名伶，，大商，巨賈，音樂家等等。並且他們都是一本正經「像煞有介事「的守住本位，三句不離「本行」的幹着。記得去歲在某雜誌見過一篇文字，提到里斯本出過一件出賣海軍文件的秘密案件，那主角却是兩位如花似玉的佳人；其一是掛着德國公爵夫人的牌子，在高等交際塲上出入，其一則是一位下流酒吧間的紅舞女。後來把事情揭穿，原來這兩位不同社會層的女性，是一雙姊妹花，正充仟着某國情報幹部的台柱子呢。</p>

<h3>風氣</h3>
<p>— 蕭毓華</p>
<p>去年夏天摩登的男士們流行穿花得刺眼的襯衫，到了今年，時髦的小姐們風行短打扮了。花樣翻新，對於都市兒女原是必要的事，正如以貴族化爲炫耀的糖菓之需要裝璜。生活之於他們，也正是裝璜。</p>
<p>而落在我們眼中的乃是一點小小的悲劇。自我喪失的悲劇。左右這類人的行動的，不是他自已，而是他自己以外的別人；他的注意所在，不是自己該怎樣做，而是別人在怎樣做。而他的行動原則，便也是別人怎樣做就怎樣做。</p>
<p>風氣原不　定是壞，只是以風氣爲風氣却是件很可悲哀的事。因爲人先得做自己的主人。若被風氣佔先了一着，那就什麽也做不得主了。如同海水中的一塊木片，任浪簸送而已。</p>
<p>花襯衫，短打扮也只是一個例子吧了。而且是一個無關大體的小例子。隨着別人混水摸魚的事，俯拾即是。眞不知有多少乖巧的人，追着別人，幹看來聰明，其實糊塗的事呢。</p>
<p>他們已失去了一點做人的原則。他們已沒有了一點內在的個性。只是迷失在烏烟瘴氣的風氣中，是非巳失去了標準。所以，他們寗肯棄去自己以爲對的事，而去跟着別人荒唐。</p>
<p>「別人都是如此。」一個多麼耳熟，却又多麼軟弱的理由呀。</p>
<h3>文人的肚皮</h3>
<p>— 汎勝之</p>
<p>說起文人，每每聯想到貧窮，而父每每聯想到他們的「吃飯問題」，是的，歷來的文人作家是運一日三餐也難維持的，他們的肚皮雖然一面忙於打「腹稿」。肚皮裏（？）塞滿了書卷墨汁，但時時「懷才不遇」，覓不到牛油與麵包的。</p>
<p>像與普希金萊蒙托夫並列的俄國作家納克拉蘇夫，他幼年與他十三個兄弟跟着父親過着貧窮的生活他很艱難的得入彼得勃魯的大學，當然屬於最窮苦的大學生的部類，他後來在「自白」裹說「三年間我差不多完全枵腹，每次只有仕飯店吃一些人家剩下的麵包屑」，這種長時的餓肚皮，我想拉氏的肚皮是有一種抵抗飢餓的靱性。</p>
<p>這種靱性是隨時可在文人中找到例子：囂俄，史蒂文生，迭更斯，杜斯退夫斯基，毛爾脫，易卜生，西萬提斯……寫出來恐怕要佔滿一大版篇幅，像自然主義先驅實騐小說的始作俑者左拉，未成名時，是餓着肚皮在盧森堡公園的椅子上讀着書有一回一個不相識的少女戰慄對他說：「我是一個錢也沒有，並且兩三天內還一點沒有吃甚麼。」左拉回答道：「我也是一樣的呀」但爲了不給這少女失望，將上衣脫了拿給少女去換一餐僅够一人的食物，自己只剩了一件襯衫而又耽贖着诗了。</p>
<p>偉大的文人們，他們的肚皮構造恐怕是與書囊一樣的吧，只覺精神的愉快，而物質的享受是毫不以爲意的，所以誰都耐得住飢餓，有幾回餓肚皮的經騐，這經騐往往寫進他們的小說，像丹麥哈梭生在篇作品裏描寫主人公的餓肚皮時的心情，占了幾頁篇幅，且勾劃入微，據說也是哈氏的經騐談，在未身歷其境的「桂冠詩人」之流是寫不出的。</p>
<p>記得我國有一位新文學家曾說：「一個文藝寫作者如果一連餓肚皮的經騐也沒有，那是不够一個作家的資格。」這也是深刻的體騐之談呢。</p>
<p>不過，有人把文人喩爲唱歌的鳥以爲不在唱歌便應該吃些東西，而科學家也會認爲一個文學家的勞心，一小時所銷耗的體力是抵得勞力者的三小時，而且腦袋的所需營養是更甚於肌肉，所以也有不少的文人是不顧錢囊的乾澀而以「吃飽肚皮」爲宗旨的，像寫虛榮之市」的薩格萊先生爲了吃一盤豬肉豆，他是情願得罪貴族的舞會；而大仲馬則是一餐能吃兩隻或三隻以上的烤鷄鴨，早餐要吃大塊的鷄蛋糕，他說不快意的吞食一番，是寫不出一個宇，而頹廢詩人愛侖坡，幾乎每天泥醉在酒店裏，他的肚皮是每天裝滿了老酒和熏臭的牛排，他在醉後才能發揮他的才情，我恐怕他們在肚子餓的時候是不能着筆，而今日世界上留下不朽的成績，在他們看來是一種酒醉飯飽後的排泄吧！</p>
<p>還有像詩人　尼生喜歡吃大塊的烤牛肉，而肚皮的容納量也是驚人的，早上吃半打鷄蛋外加兩磅牛肉，及乳油，一大堆洋葱，中午是佐以六塊黃豆燒豬肉，鹿腿等等的美食，這種大肚皮也怕是很少見的了</p>
<p>可　　尼生生活在優閒的世界·　個桂冠詩人，平日出入宮廷，舒服優逸怕也是使他肚皮放寬的一個原因，而我國的袁中郞竟編起「隨園食譜」，家中聘了名廚釀酒製菜，也是雅閒之所致。</p>
<p>最後以薩格萊的名讚烤羊詩，作爲本文的結束：</p>
<p>「一隻，上好的烤羊腿。我求你爲我燒好，在三點鐘。要燒得爛，加些醬，我的好露賽！天下，可還有比這更美的好食品嗎？」</p>
<h3>戰爭新式輕坦克</h3>

<h3>黑暗</h3>
<p>— 田雨</p>
<p>教不歌頌黑暗，正如我不禮讚醜惡，只是我有勇氣面對黑暗，我努力了解黑暗。所以茫茫夜，我在伸手不見五指的路上蹀　。</p>
<p>有時，我們必須懂得黑暗，因爲它是一種鐵的存在；同時也是一種相對的存在。如果沒有如墨的黑夜，你將永遠想像不出一個銀月夜的美麗，溫柔的月光的輕瀉終將化爲烏有</p>
<p>黑夜不僅點綴了月光的美麗，它也喚起了你對光明的渴望呢。</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（五）拔來報往</p>
<p>可是眞像羣珍說的，一會兒就有人來招呼翠珍小姐出去，又一會，又有人來說：「大太太靈前要上祭了，請少爺出去。」國器道：「他們忙，我們再也不能敎他們忙上加忙。」便向底下人手裏要了飯來吃，等維城翠珍回到裏邊，他們兄妹已是擦過了臉在喝茶。維城致了歉意，國器拉着維城手搖撼一下道：「你眞當我們是客人，那可不成。那幾間屋子，我可以出進自由的，你吿訴我。」</p>
<p>這一晚，維城名爲請國器歇宿在一個房裹，爲了羽士的鐃鈸叮噹，爲了親友紛紛議論着出殯的儀仗和路由，爲了什麼做半夜七和鬧五更，國器倦了，只在藤椅上靠一下，不會肯大模大樣上牀去安睡。次日，維城對國芳說：「我眞的要派你做招待了。」國芳一諾無辭。國器自顧自把幾間屋子裏掛的聯幛，巡視了一遍。從早上八點起，開始有了弔客，一直到正午，源源不絕，道父不比昨天晚上，昨天晚上不過是十來席，今天可就加了幾倍。</p>
<p>維城是匍匐在孝幃裏，照例不出來見客，厲又榭派的幾個職員，還都能盡職。舉殯的時候，孝幃裏突然喧鬧起來，說有一位女客，暈厥仆地。厲又榭正在塲上排道，奔進去探問，原來楚翠珍悲哀過度，因此一口氣回不過來，不知人事。那好得名醫黃石甫的及門弟子楊小甫，和西醫杜紹邦，都在做弔客不會走。大家來問楊小甫和林紹邦，楊小甫立即執筆處方：林紹邦也說不妨事，敎把翠珍胸脯口的小褂解開了，又給注射一針。等翠珍哇一聲哭出來。却看的把國芳也哭了。因爲道麽一來，翠珍便沒去送殯，國芳父自吿奮勇負起看護翠珍的責任來。　（八一）</p>

<h3>Kharkov "Steel Battle": German Position Gradually Improves, Soviets Claim New Strategy Being Used</h3>
<p>Stockholm, May 19 (Havas World Telegraph) – According to military sources here, the fighting in the Kharkov area has calmed down in the past 24 hours, and the German position has visibly improved. According to a semi-official German statement, the German army has launched a major counter-offensive to block the Red Army's advance and is still engaged in fierce fighting. However, the German army is now able to control the overall situation. Moscow claims that the purpose of the Soviet offensive is not to occupy any cities, but to eliminate the enemy and its equipment. Soviet newspapers also stated that a new strategy was used in the fighting near Kharkov to "save manpower." Soviet broadcast news also stated that the German resistance was very fierce, and they used paratroopers for the first time when fighting in the open fields. However, the Red Army had already deployed cavalry to immediately eliminate or capture enemy soldiers after they landed behind enemy lines. There is reason to believe that wars of the same nature as those in the Kharkov and Kerch areas will occur in other areas, especially in the areas of Leningrad, Kalinin, and Lake Ilmen. It is reported that the Red Army has repeatedly attacked in the area of Lake Ilmen, so the German army has been frequently mobilized between Vyazma and Valkiv in recent days.</p>
<p>London, May 20 (Reuters) – The "steel battle" on the Kharkov front is still underway. The German army is using all its strength to block the Red Army from breaking through various points, mainly with tanks. It is reported that in yesterday's battle, the German army used as many as 150 tanks on a two-and-a-half-mile front. In another location, the German first line used 100 tanks, the second line used 80 tanks, and the third line used 50 tanks. According to Moscow's announcement last night, the troops of General Timoshenko, commander-in-chief of the Southern Front, are advancing steadily and have gained a stronghold on a certain highway behind the German army. The German army is also making every effort to defend this road, which is the main transportation line for the German army and connects two cities, which form an obtuse angle with Kharkov. General von Bock, commander-in-chief of the German Southern Front, has established a defensive network to the east, and every village is a strong stronghold. According to Soviet official reports, since the 7th, the Red Army on this front has destroyed or captured nearly 500 German tanks and more than 600 artillery pieces.</p>
<p>Moscow, May 20 (Reuters) – The Moscow Broadcasting Station announced that the Soviet army on the Kharkov front is continuing to advance and is defeating the stubborn German army. Soviet artillery is fiercely bombarding German infantry and tank convoys, and the Soviet Air Force is bombing German-occupied airfields and dense German troop formations.</p>
<p>German Side Issues Special War Report: Kerch Campaign Concludes</p>
<p>Berlin, May 19 (Haitong News Agency) – The German High Command issued the following special war report at the Führer's headquarters last night, stating that the German-Romanian forces in Crimea, under the command of General von Manstein, have reached the Kerch Strait and are now pursuing the defending forces at various points. The last strong bridgehead in the Kerch urban area was occupied on Tuesday after fierce fighting, so the Kerch campaign has come to an end. It is estimated that three Soviet armies were annihilated, including 17 infantry divisions, three brigades, two cavalry divisions, and an armored brigade. 149,156 Soviet soldiers were captured, and 3,133 artillery pieces, 372 rocket launchers, 258 tanks, 3,814 vehicles, several hundred war horses, and a large number of light weapons were seized. Only remnants of the troops crossed the strait to reach the other side. The air force units led by General Lörzer and Baron von Richthofen made great efforts in this battle. German aircraft covered ground troops and inflicted heavy damage on the fleeing Soviet army. A total of 323 Soviet aircraft were shot down in air combat. In the waters of the Kerch Peninsula, a total of 16 enemy ships were sunk, totaling 136,000 tons, along with one minesweeper and 21 coastal boats. In addition, 10 enemy ships were severely damaged, and the enemy suffered heavy losses when crossing the strait.</p>
<p>Moscow, May 20 (Reuters) – The Soviet midday communiqué stated that our army on the Kharkov front launched an offensive on the 19th. The Kerch area of the Kerch Peninsula is continuing to see fierce fighting. There were no major changes in other areas.</p>
<h3>Troop Transport to Singapore: Queen of Asia Liner Sunk by Bombing, Over Two Thousand British Soldiers Mostly Rescued</h3>
<p>Ottawa, May 20 (Reuters) – The large mail ship "Queen of Asia" was sunk while transporting troops to reinforce Singapore before its fall. The official announcement was only made here last night. Fourteen rescued Canadian sailors have now safely arrived at a port in eastern Canada. They described the incident as follows: "The 'Queen of Asia' was attacked by multiple Japanese dive bombers six miles from Singapore. Bombs rained down, and several hits caused multiple fires on the ship. In an instant, the entire ship became a mountain of flames. All the lifeboats were destroyed by fire. Fortunately, the small Australian cruiser 'Yella' arrived, and 1,500 British soldiers on board were mostly rescued before the ship sank, and all 100 sailors also escaped safely. The 'Queen of Asia' was originally a luxurious large mail ship. When it sank, it had been burned into a twisted steel skeleton, and there is no hope of salvaging it."</p>

<h3>British House of Commons Continues to Debate the War Situation in Tense Atmosphere, Churchill Unable to Attend in Person, Deputy Prime Minister Reports on Recent Developments</h3>
<p>London, May 20 (Havas News Agency) – The House of Commons met today and began debating the war situation in a tense atmosphere. Prime Minister Churchill was unable to attend in person, and some members protested, leading to an argument with government representative Cripps. The debate then officially began. First, Cripps announced that the former wartime cabinet minister stationed in the Far East, Duff Cooper, did not want to submit a report on his time in Singapore. Deputy Prime Minister Attlee then reported on the recent developments on various battlefields, stating, "Japan has gained naval supremacy in the Far East, so we are in a disadvantageous position. General Alexander is currently in Burma, covering the retreat of troops. General Alexander is commanding effectively. The loss of Burma has caused major difficulties. Maritime traffic from Burma to India has been cut off, and our military position is becoming increasingly difficult. The Japanese army is currently threatening China. It is difficult to say at this moment whether the Japanese army will attack India, but our country must prepare for any eventuality. British troops on the island of Ceylon have been strengthened. In addition, with British troops occupying Diego Suarez Port, the Japanese army may change direction and attack Australia and New Zealand. There is no news yet regarding the naval battle in the Coral Sea. Britain must study all possibilities and send reinforcements to Australia. On the Eastern Front, General Timoshenko is leading the Red Army in a major counter-offensive in the Kharkov area. I dare say that everyone is excited. It is difficult to say at this moment whether this counter-offensive is a prelude to the Red Army's overall counter-offensive. However, no matter what the Soviet Union's war plan is, we still believe that the Red Army will be able to demonstrate the same fighting strength and resistance in the summer war as it did in the winter war. For us, we should transport all kinds of military supplies to the Soviet Union in a steady stream, but this is not easy. Due to the current climate conditions, it is especially difficult to go to the port of Murmansk by sea. Our navy and merchant fleet have encountered great difficulties in their efforts to transport ammunition and artillery to the Soviet Union. As for opening a second battlefield, I can tell you that we have never neglected the possibility of fighting in Europe. The German General Staff must be well aware of this. The war front in the current war is extremely broad, and this is what we cannot forget. At the same time, we must also understand that our defense line starts from the port of Murmansk, passes through southern Europe and Africa, and reaches the Far East. The British Navy protects the transportation lines, ensuring that they are unimpeded, and assists the merchant fleet in transporting food, ammunition, and other military supplies to various battlefields, which is quite commendable. We are fighting together with our Allied countries in the current war, but there are many inconveniences due to the great distances between us. During the last war, the Allied Supreme Military Council could meet within a few hours, but this is absolutely impossible this time. It is actually impossible for Chiang Kai-shek, Stalin, Roosevelt, and the prime ministers of various autonomous territories to come to London or to go with Prime Minister Churchill to a certain central location to directly direct military affairs, as each leader is an indispensable leader in their own country and cannot leave the country for even a step. Fortunately, we have established the Allied Supreme Military Council in Washington D.C. and sent military delegations to the Soviet Union. We have made great efforts to coordinate various military strategies and military supply issues. All of these issues must be decided by Prime Minister Churchill and cannot be shirked off. I have worked with the Prime Minister for two years, and I dare to assure you that Britain has not had such a wise leader for a long time," he said.</p>
<p>Second Day of Debate</p>
<p>Belisha Speaks</p>
<p>London, May 20 (Reuters) – When the House of Commons resumed debating the war situation today, former Secretary of War Belisha (Independent Party member) claimed that Britain currently has a feeling of optimism, a reversal of the mood during the previous war situation debate in February. The Soviet Union's heroic start to the spring offensive in Europe has inspired us, but the Japanese are still advancing. The line by which China receives aid from Allied nations has been cut off. Japan has obtained the equipment of at least 250,000 Allied soldiers. The other side's challenging power has not weakened. We must understand that we are not only fighting Germany alone, but are fighting a united Axis. We must use a united strategy to deal with the other side's united strategy. As for the Far East, whether the frequent transfer of General Wavell was a wise move is questionable. Wavell was first transferred from the Middle East to India, then to the Southwest Pacific Command, and then back to India, while Singapore and Burma each changed their commanders three times. This move failed to establish confidence among the fighting troops and implied a wavering purpose. Therefore, the internal joint planning of Britain needs to be improved. Churchill's system of controlling the work of the General Staff is inappropriate. Belisha then touched on the lack of air support for the British Army, stating that Soviet troops launched the Kharkov offensive with the help of a large number of Shturmovik dive bombers, while the German army used 2,000 dive bombers to assist in the offensive on the Kerch Peninsula. The occupation of the entire territory in the Far East was not due to the large number of enemy troops, but due to the use of modern tactics. The British army does not have this kind of air support. General Alexander, the commander of the British army in Burma, is one of the most capable generals in the British army, but his troops in Burma were severely short of food and drink, their transportation was destroyed, their ammunition was bombed, and they had to wade through swamps, with water up to their necks, and were constantly harassed by mosquitoes and snakes, picking wild fruits to satisfy their hunger, all due to the lack of sufficient air support. After three years of war, this situation is intolerable. Belisha concluded by stating that modern lessons must be learned.</p>
<h3>The Only Peace in the World: A Candid Talk on Lisbon (Part 2) – The Exchange for International Diplomats, Special Report from Our Newspaper</h3>
<p>Sailors from ships of various countries were either working or chatting there. Although not particularly intimate with each other, there was no risk of them engaging in any hostile behavior.</p>
<p>Even more astonishing is the Sintra Airdrome on the outskirts of Lisbon. Amidst the flames of world war, this airfield had planes of various types from various countries parked side by side. If you went to the airfield's office, you would find the same notices and the like posted in English, German, French, and five other languages. Some might ask, "Aren't these planes from different countries flying on different routes afraid of being attacked by enemy countries?" This is something to be reassured about, because the warring nations want to maintain a common contact and transportation route. In that way, they can inquire about each other's news. Because of this relationship, no one wants to do a "foul trick" attack, treating unarmed commercial aircraft as enemy planes in actual combat.</p>
<p>Lisbon is such a place where warring and non-warring countries mix and make contact. Therefore, in addition to the diplomatic envoys of various countries, the most active people in the city are spies of various nationalities. Some fly their own country's flag, probing for news for their country in various situations. Others are eyes of unknown nationality, engaging in professional espionage, selling international secrets they acquire as merchandise. However, no matter what kind of spy they are, they do not need to be secretive or furtive in Lisbon. On the contrary, they are even willing to put up a sign to attract customers, in order to facilitate the absorption of various valuable information.</p>
<p>Of course, this cannot be generalized. The highest-level, formal, and important spies still do not want to show their faces. They are either science professors, viscounts, marquises, famous courtesans, famous actors, big merchants, tycoons, musicians, and so on. And they all keep to their positions in a serious, "as if it matters" manner, and their conversation never leaves their "profession." I remember seeing an article in a magazine last year that mentioned a secret case in Lisbon involving the sale of naval documents. The protagonists were two beautiful women. One was a German duchess who frequented high society gatherings, and the other was a red-light dancer in a low-class bar. Later, it was revealed that these two women from different social strata were sisters, serving as pillars of the intelligence agency of a certain country.</p>

<h3>Coffins from Ningbo Must Be Reburied Within a Time Limit</h3>
<p>It is heard that the authorities, in view of the accumulation of coffins in the funeral homes in this city, which is quite a burden on sanitation facilities and indirectly endangers the policy of dispersing the population, the Navy, Army, and special agencies have decided to first register the coffins of Ningbo origin within a time limit and transport them back in batches for burial. Coffins from other places will be transported back to their place of origin successively after a solution is determined. The Shanghai Siming Guildhall Guohua Funeral Home has been notified to undertake the registration and shipping matters. All Ningbo-Shanghai ships have also been notified to be responsible for transportation, ensuring safety. The cabin prices are set at the lowest possible amount. To be cautious, Guohua has specially asked the Jinlai Company Transportation Department in this city to carefully design the transportation method. It is heard that close contact has been established with Ningbo and the local Siming Guildhall, which can absolutely guarantee safety. The guildhall is preparing everything to accommodate the coffins returning to Ningbo, and it is agreed to start shipping at the end of this month. It will also respect the customs and traditions of the Chinese people and provide convenience. If the family members escorting the coffin must return to Shanghai, they can apply for a round-trip certificate.</p>
<h3>The Tiger That Died in the French Park to Be Dissected and Examined</h3>
<p>A male tiger kept in the zoo in the French Park on Rue Lupan died of illness the day before yesterday afternoon. Even a brave tiger could not withstand the invasion of germs, which is quite intriguing. The personnel in charge of the animal section of the park intend to hand the tiger over to the hospital for dissection to examine the cause of death. After the examination, a specimen will be made and displayed as a memorial. According to a report from the Datong News Agency, five or six years ago, a tiger died of illness in the Municipal Zoo on Penglai Road in the Nanshi district. After dissection, it was found that the cause of death was lung disease, because the lungs were completely ulcerated. At that time, doctors speculated that the cause of the lung disease was due to the overwhelming invasion of the city's foul air.</p>

The program they will perform also includes first-class European musical works. Ms. Li Huifang will provide accompaniment. It is expected that there will be many artistic contributions at that time. This kind of concert is also quite educational.</p>

<h3>The 47th Lecture of the Rongwu Society: Why Confucianism and Buddhism Agree</h3>
<p>The 47th Buddhist Lecture of the Rongwu Sutra Lecture Society, the fifth session, was given by Mr. Shen Jueling on the reason why Confucianism and Buddhism agree. Everyone knows that Confucianism is a method for entering the world, and Buddhism is a method for transcending the world. But how can they be said to agree? The Buddhist method of transcending the world must enter the world to save people, so transcending the world still requires entering the world. Confucianism is a method for entering the world, and Confucius, in his commentary on the Book of Changes, said to "return to the origin and go back to the end, so know the teachings about death and life." If one reads "return to the origin and go back to the end" as "beginnings and endings," then life is its beginning and death is its ending. If one reads it as "return," then death is the beginning of life, and life is the ending of death, which is the teaching of reincarnation. Zisi wrote in the Doctrine of the Mean, describing the virtues of the sages and ancestors, and praised the virtues of ghosts and spirits. In the Analects, Zilu asked about ghosts and spirits, and Confucius said, "If you are not yet able to serve men, how can you serve ghosts?" When asked about death, he said, "If you do not yet know life, how can you know death?" This does not mean that Confucianism does not deal with ghosts and spirits, or does not want to know death. It simply means that one must first be able to serve men before one can serve ghosts and spirits, and one must first know life before one can know death. Because human affairs are complex and ever-changing, and it is not easy to deal with them, one must think about how to deal with them. If one can deal with them, then one can serve men. Life is a heavy responsibility, and it is not easy to bear. One must think about how to bear it. If one knows how to bear it, then one knows life. This is like those who believe in Buddhism must first enter a Buddhist temple and become a monk to practice diligently before they can be worthy of being a Buddhist disciple. Although lay Buddhists do not leave home, their diligent practice is the same as being a monk. Their starting points may be different, but their principles are the same. Then, Mr. Yang Zhongyi quoted the Book of Changes, the Book of Rites, the Zuo Zhuan, the Song Confucian li-learning, and the Mahayana Chan and Esoteric teachings to elaborate on its meaning, and concluded with the two phrases "The superior man understands upward, the inferior man understands downward." After the lecture, he announced that the next lecture would be on the 24th, a lecture on Chinese studies, with strict attendance.</p>

<h3>Mail Carrier Arrested for Drug Trafficking</h3>

At 4 pm that day, Mao obtained a package of morphine from his friend Qin Guolian at the Shenzhou Hotel on Zhejiang Road, hid it in the mailbag, and planned to go to Nanshi by boat to Zhoupu.

<h3>The Gloomy Atmosphere Is Swept Away, Public Debt Rebounds and Rises to the Limit</h3>
<p>The public debt grey market suddenly rebounded sharply yesterday. Types B, C, D, and E all rose by more than four yuan to the daily limit. Type A, although it did not hit the daily limit, also rose by a good three yuan and three corners. The long-standing depression suddenly unfolded, and the gloomy atmosphere was swept away. The market price rose smoothly all the way. Types D and E broke through the 50 yuan mark again. After a storm, suddenly seeing the sun is also a proper expression of the bond market. It can also be seen that the efforts of the bulls have paid off. Although Tongli sold some yesterday, the number was small. Hongxing was the first to sell, and the number was also not large. Yongkang, Hongda, Huichang, Wuhe, Jiufu, Xinji, Renchang, and Dechang all sold, but the buyers were very enthusiastic for a while. The market price jumped up because the supply could not meet the demand. For example, after Type A made two yuan, it immediately made three yuan. After three and a half yuan, it immediately made four and a half yuan. Type D only made one opening price, which was 50 yuan, and then it hit the daily limit. The morale was high, unprecedented. The buyers were Qianyi, Tongkang, Runde, Yongchang, Lianyi, Hu Heji, Tongshun, Yuanhe, Lianhe, Xie Kang, and Hengfu, all absorbing at any price. In terms of market price, it is indeed cheap, and it is purchased with a dividend. Therefore, the author said that if the bulls can continue to work hard, they will surely win one day. However, it is not known whether there are still remaining goods for sale in the future. As a result, the market price generally rose by three yuan and three corners to four yuan, with four types hitting the daily limit. The turnover was approximately one million yuan. A brief table is listed below. Type Highest Lowest Closing Change from Previous Day Unified A 61.00 61.50 64.00 Up 3.30 Unified B 57.00 57.50 57.00 Up 4.00 Unified C 56.50 52.90 56.50 Up 4.00 Unified D 50.00 -- 50.00 Up 4.00 Unified E 52.40 50.20 51.40 Up 4.00</p>

<h3>Factory Cotton Yarn Prices Fall Amidst Uncertainty, Rumors of Possible Refunds Abound</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market shows slightly calmer spot conditions, as rumors from the previous day proved untrue, and the price surge in the past two days led some bulls to take profits, resulting in a more stable market. However, rumors of favorable factory single sales have caused prices to rebound, but the situation remains volatile, leaving people in a fog. 42s Blue Phoenix eased from 16,800 yuan to 16,300 yuan, closing at 16,500 yuan. 42s Water Moon was at 15,500 yuan, 42s Fairy Peach at 15,400 yuan, 32s Fairy Peach at 14,250 yuan, 60s Wu Zi at 27,200 yuan, 40s Sunlight at 14,700 yuan, 20s Yue Qin from 8,150 yuan to 8,000 yuan, 20s Li Ma at 8,650 yuan, 20s Blue Phoenix at 8,550 yuan, 20s Golden Pagoda at 8,200 yuan, 20s Double Horse from 8,400 yuan to 8,250 yuan, 20s Double Globe from 8,400 yuan to 8,250 yuan, 20s Heavenly Maiden at 8,000 yuan, 10s Boy Scout from 6,950 yuan to 6,600 yuan, 10s Red Double Horse from 6,950 yuan to 6,650 yuan, 10s New True at 6,400 yuan, 10s Double Globe at 6,650 yuan, 10s Victory at 3,750 yuan, 8s Li Hu at 6,520 yuan. The initial opening price for 20s Double Horse factory singles was 6,400 yuan, closing at 6,320 yuan, but immediately after closing, prices soared, with rumors circulating that factory singles could be refunded, and gray market prices already reaching 6,700 to 6,800 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Prices Soar Irrationally, Inland Prices are Reversed, and Actual Sales Have Long Ceased</h3>
<p>Cotton Cloth: Yesterday, the cloth market initially declined due to the drop in East Piece, but then surged due to the sharp rise in Double Horse Yarn factory singles. Bids in various markets still showed more increases than decreases. 16-pound Globe coarse cloth was at 280 yuan, Flying Phoenix at 272 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong at 152.5 yuan, 12-pound Fugui fine cloth had selling at the morning opening at 245 yuan, but later rose to 250 yuan, Globe fine cloth at 255 yuan. Yao Hua Ladies' Lin Ba Fu experienced even greater volatility, falling to 379 yuan in the morning, rising to 390 yuan in the afternoon, and closing at 388 yuan. Chickadee Sheeting at 386 yuan, Longevity Fuchou silk at 8.5 yuan, Wan Ben Li at 8.2 yuan, Volleyball yarn Fuchou silk at 6 yuan. Eastern Cloth: Prices fell first and then rose. The speculative actions of traders are completely irrational. It is said that merchants in Beijing and Hangzhou used to be able to sell Longtou fine cloth, when it was priced within 300 yuan, for 330-340 yuan in those cities. Now, the Shanghai market has soared to 340 yuan, but it is difficult to sell it even at 300 yuan in Beijing and Hangzhou. Market prices have become inverted, indicating that people no longer have the purchasing power. Therefore, actual sales have ceased long ago. The continued surge in recent days is nothing more than general speculative manipulation, with blind囤积户 (dun ji hu - hoarding households), and a reaction is not far off. New orders for 12-pound Longtou fine cloth saw prices decline due to the stipulation of savings certificates at 74% cash. Market sentiment turned weak, opening at 331 yuan and falling straight to 320 yuan. Midday closing slightly rose to 322 yuan. In the afternoon, rumors of a surge in the Double Horse gray market emerged, opening immediately at 334 yuan, reaching a peak of 340 yuan, and closing at 338.5 yuan, an increase of another 4 yuan from the previous day. The smallest price for Four Gentlemen Serge Red singles was 11.14 yuan, with a maximum of 12.3 yuan, and closing at 12.15 yuan, an increase of 0.2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Decline Rapidly</h3>
<p>Cash: The black market suddenly rebounded and declined. This is because the discount on promissory notes has decreased, and the premium on savings certificates has been set at a 74% discount. This has stabilized market sentiment. The morning opening was 22,800 yuan, a decrease of 150 yuan compared to the previous day, and 600 yuan lower than the gray market. Cash houses and Tianjin firms sold off aggressively, and one firm had strong selling intentions, continuing to lower prices by 550 yuan, falling to 22,250 yuan. Securities firms and another cash house then raised prices to 22,700 yuan, but gold firms and another group sold heavily. The final transaction price at noon was 22,400 yuan, a decrease of 550 yuan from the previous day's closing price, and 1,000 yuan lower than the afternoon price. Prices then rebounded in the afternoon with buyers at 22,800 yuan, reportedly due to rumors about the paper currency.</p>
<p>Silver jewelry in silver shops was uniformly marked down by 150 yuan by major new firms, to 2,250 yuan per tael. Prices rebounded by 50 yuan in the afternoon, reaching 2,300 yuan (purchases reduced by 200 yuan). Refined silver was listed at 18 yuan, with the black market price at 15.67 yuan. Silver coins were at 9.45 yuan each, all showing declines.</p>
<h3>Discount Rates Decline</h3>
<p>In the foreign exchange market, the British gold pound and the US dollar remained flat and weak. The former remained at 520 yuan, and the latter at 530 yuan. US dollar notes were at 35-36 yuan, Hong Kong notes around 5 yuan. Military notes opened at 7.97 yuan in the morning, rose to 8.03 yuan, then fell to 7.67 yuan, and finally closed at 7.83 yuan, a decrease of 0.17 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<p>The discount rate for promissory notes fell from 90 yuan per thousand to around 55 yuan, eventually settling at 65 yuan and 66 yuan, a decrease of 30 yuan. The interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association remained at 0.15 yuan. The Central Reserve Bank of China's (CRB) listed exchange rate was changed to 74% from yesterday. Authorized exchange banks still allowed each person to exchange 300 法幣 (fabi - legal tender) for 222 yuan in CRB notes, a reduction of 9 yuan in CRB notes compared to before. Furthermore, the interbank rate for CRB promissory notes opened at 1.45 yuan yesterday, reaching a low of 1.40 yuan, and closing at around 1.47 yuan. Cash was at 1.357 yuan, the buying and selling price between silver firms and small money shops. However, there were rumors of changes in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Golden Vegetables Rebound</h3>
<p>Golden vegetables rebound. Since the Taiwanese groups have massively purchased daylily, the market inventory suddenly feels thin, and the number of plates has also become tight. Yesterday, the market opened up by 30 to 40 yuan, and the Taiwanese gang continued to release prices to purchase, so the market has a tendency to continue to tighten. The line market has called for an increase of 50 to 60 yuan.</p>
<p>Ordinary black dates. The Taiwanese gangs have continued to search for purchases in recent days, with a total number of about thousands of dan, so the market trend is gradually stabilizing. Yesterday, the market trader Tongshou dates sold for 256 yuan (Northern Standard), and Zhuang Gao also called for an increase, but because the removal was relatively weak, it was not easy to get better for a while.</p>
<h3>Billet Market is Lively</h3>
<p>In recent days, the market for black iron billets has been very lively. Local iron factories, machinery factories, iron printing factories, and billet factories have been consuming a lot, with daily intake. However, it has been verified that the source of goods has disappeared, and the inventory in Shanghai is not abundant, so those holding goods are optimistic and prices are being supported. Yesterday, 2,000-pound old steel mill goods were selling for 14,000 yuan per ton, and Huilin Deng goods were also selling for 13,000 yuan, an increase of 300 to 400 yuan compared to the previous market price.</p>

<h3>Trend</h3>
<p>— Xiao Yuhua</p>
<p>Last summer, fashionable men were wearing flashy shirts, and this year, trendy young ladies are favoring short outfits. Constantly changing styles are necessary for urbanites, just as decoration is needed for candy that flaunts its aristocratic nature. Life for them is precisely that: decoration.</p>
<p>And what we see is a small tragedy: the tragedy of losing oneself. What guides the actions of these people is not themselves, but others outside themselves; their focus is not on what they should do, but on what others are doing. And their principle of action is to do what others do.</p>
<p>Trends are not necessarily bad, but taking trends as trends is a very sad thing. Because people must first be their own masters. If you are preempted by a trend, then you can't be the master of anything. Like a piece of wood in the sea, tossed about by the waves.</p>
<p>Flashy shirts and short outfits are just one example. And a small, insignificant example. The act of following others and muddling through is everywhere. I really don't know how many clever people are chasing after others, doing things that seem smart but are actually foolish.</p>
<p>They have lost a bit of the principle of being human. They no longer have a bit of inner individuality. They are just lost in the murky atmosphere of trends, and the standards of right and wrong have been lost. So, they would rather abandon what they think is right and follow others' absurdities.</p>
<p>"Everyone else is doing it." What a familiar but weak reason.</p>
<h3>The Bellies of Men of Letters</h3>
<p>— Fan Shengzhi</p>
<p>Speaking of men of letters, one often thinks of poverty, and of their "eating problem." Yes, men of letters and writers throughout history have had difficulty maintaining their daily meals. Their bellies are busy drafting ideas but filled with books and ink, yet they are often "unappreciated" and cannot find butter and bread.</p>
<p>Like Nikolai Nekrasov, a Russian writer ranked alongside Pushkin and Lermontov, he lived a poor life with his thirteen siblings following his father. He managed to enter the University of Saint Petersburg with great difficulty, certainly belonging to the poorest category of students. He later said in his "Confessions," "For three years, I was almost always hungry, and I could only eat some leftover bread crumbs from the dining hall." I think Nekrasov's belly had a resistance to hunger due to this long period of starvation.</p>
<p>Examples of this resilience can be found among men of letters at any time: Xiao E, Stevenson, Dickens, Dostoevsky, Mault, Ibsen, Cervantes… Listing them would probably take up a whole page. Like Émile Zola, the pioneer of naturalistic experimental novels, when he was not famous, he read books on a bench in the Luxembourg Gardens while hungry. Once, an unfamiliar young woman trembled and said to him, "I don't have a penny, and I haven't eaten anything for two or three days." Zola replied, "I am the same." But in order not to disappoint the young woman, he took off his coat and gave it to her to exchange for a meal that was only enough for one person, leaving himself with only a shirt, and still indulging in poetry.</p>
<p>The bellies of great men of letters are probably constructed like book bags, only feeling spiritual pleasure, and not caring about material enjoyment at all. Therefore, they can all endure hunger. They often write about their experiences of starving in their novels, like Hans Christian Andersen of Denmark, who devoted several pages to describing the protagonist's hunger and the accompanying emotions, saying that it was Andersen's own experience, which those "crowned poets" who had never experienced it could not write about.</p>
<p>I remember a new literary figure in our country once said: "A literary writer is not qualified as a writer if they have never experienced hunger." This is also a profound reflection.</p>
<p>However, some people compare men of letters to singing birds, believing that they should eat something when they are not singing. Scientists also believe that the mental labor of a literary figure for one hour consumes as much physical energy as a laborer for three hours, and that the brain needs more nutrition than muscles. Therefore, many men of letters disregard their empty wallets and make "eating their fill" their goal. For example, Mr. Thackeray, who wrote "Vanity Fair," was willing to offend a noble's ball for a plate of pork and beans; and Alexandre Dumas could eat two or three roasted chickens and ducks in one meal, and ate a large piece of chicken cake for breakfast, saying that he could not write a single word without swallowing it heartily. And the decadent poet Edgar Allan Poe was almost always drunk in hotels, his belly filled with old wine and smoked beefsteak every day. He could only unleash his talent after being drunk. I am afraid that they could not write when they were hungry, and that the immortal achievements they left behind in the world today were a kind of excretion after being drunk and full!</p>
<p>There is also the poet Tennyson, who liked to eat large pieces of roast beef, and whose belly was also surprisingly accommodating. In the morning, he ate half a dozen eggs plus two pounds of beef, as well as cream and a large pile of onions. At noon, he ate delicacies such as six pieces of pork belly braised with soybeans and deer legs. Such a big belly is probably rare.</p>
<p>It may be that Tennyson lived in a leisurely world, was a crowned poet, and regularly went to the palace, comfortable and comfortable, which may also be a reason for his belly to widen. And Yuan Zhonglang in our country even compiled the "Suiyuan Food List," hired a famous chef at home to brew wine and make dishes, which was also caused by leisure.</p>
<p>Finally, let's end this article with Thackeray's poem praising roast lamb:</p>
<p>"A good roast leg of lamb. I beg you to roast it well for me, at three o'clock. Roast it until it is tender, add some sauce, my good Lucet! In the world, is there any better food than this?"</p>
<h3>New Light Tanks in the War</h3>
<p>— Shen Xiong</p>
<p>Although there have not been any particularly strange new weapons in this war, it has broken traditional concepts. The main force of the war is now tanks and aircraft. The above picture shows a new type of light tank, with a speed of up to 50 miles per hour, equipped with three machine guns and a two-way short-wave radio. At full speed, it can jump over low embankments. The above picture shows the scene of the recent mechanical unit's grand review when it jumped over the embankment. (Editor's note: The picture of "Puppet Band" published on the 18th was mistakenly inverted. We hereby correct it.)</p>
<p>Essays</p>
<h3>Darkness</h3>
<p>— Tian Yu</p>
<p>I do not praise darkness, just as I do not praise ugliness, but I have the courage to face darkness, and I strive to understand darkness. So, in the vast night, I stumble along a road where I cannot see my fingers.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we must understand darkness, because it is an iron existence; and it is also a relative existence. If there were no ink-like dark night, you would never imagine the beauty of a silver moonlit night, and the gentle outpouring of moonlight would eventually vanish.</p>
<p>The dark night not only adorns the beauty of moonlight, but it also awakens your desire for light.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Boat in Storm</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(5) Reciprocity</p>
<p>But as Qunzhen said, someone came to invite Miss Cuizhen out in a moment, and then someone else came to say, "The grand madam wants to offer sacrifices before her spirit, please ask the young master to go out." Guogi said, "They are busy, we can't make them busier." Then he asked the people below for food to eat, and by the time Weicheng and Cuizhen returned inside, the siblings had already wiped their faces and were drinking tea. Weicheng apologized, Guogi shook Weicheng's hand and said, "If you really treat us as guests, that won't do. I can come and go freely in those rooms, you tell me."</p>
<p>That night, Weicheng nominally asked Guogi to rest in a room, but because of the Daoist priests' clanging cymbals, because of the relatives and friends discussing the funeral procession and route, and because of what to do at midnight and dawn, Guogi was tired and only leaned on the rattan chair and would not lie down on the bed to sleep. The next day, Weicheng said to Guofang, "I really have to assign you to be the host." Guofang agreed without refusing. Guogi inspected the couplets hanging in several rooms himself. From eight o'clock in the morning, mourners began to arrive, and they continued until noon, 道父 (dao fu - funeral banquet) was much more than last night. Last night there were only a dozen tables, but today there were several times more.</p>
<p>Weicheng was prostrate in the mourning curtain, as usual, and did not come out to meet the guests. Several staff members sent by Li Yousha were able to perform their duties. During the funeral, there was a sudden commotion in the mourning curtain, saying that a female guest had fainted and fallen to the ground. Li Yousha, who was arranging the procession on the field, rushed in to inquire and found that Chu Cuizhen was too sad, so she could not catch her breath and lost consciousness. Fortunately, Yang Xiaofu, a disciple of the famous doctor Huang Shifu, and the Western doctor Du Shaobang, were both mourners and had not left. Everyone asked Yang Xiaofu and Lin Shaobang, Yang Xiaofu immediately wrote a prescription: Lin Shaobang also said that it was okay, and told them to untie Cuizhen's small coat on her chest and gave her an injection. When Cuizhen cried out, Guofang was also seen crying. Because of this, Cuizhen did not go to the funeral, and Guofang took the initiative to take responsibility for taking care of Cuizhen. (81)</p>
