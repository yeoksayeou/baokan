<h3>西報以滿腔熱望向日僑進靜言大陸新報作意義深長之警告泰晤士報引伸其說撰文勗勉</h3>
<p>上海泰晤士報昨刊社評題為警告在華日人略稱本市日文人陸新報社評攔昨刊一文對在華日僑發一意義賞格工之警告誡具愼勿以戰勝者面目對待華人並謂日本有戰勝者應更緊勒其甲胄之古諺在華日人應守此精神而日常生活出以溫文固不得以傲慢態度對待華人也云云</p>
<p>幸弗再蹈英美覆轍</p>
<p>查現行戰爭之目的不容忽視自不待言質言之日人亟應處處防範免蹈美英在華之覆轍如果日本僅在中國替代舊有之英美勢力則其作戰努力之大部份實屬待勞藍日本之眞願厥為協助中國自立並與日本合作以擺脫英美之桎梏而獲取亞洲民族之永久和小與繁榮</p>
<p>理應增強中國力量</p>
<p>是故日本理應增強中國之力量而不得蓄意阻撓中國經濟與防衛力之賡續　滋長如欲協助中國更臻強盛務必樹立擺脫帝國主義侵略之新局面庶華人得運用其天然能力為本國以至世界謀最大之利益說日本竟向帝國主義之途誤進一步必將在華成為第二個英美而自敗其目的矣</p>
<p>日僑當知責任重大</p>
<p>吾人竊願乘此機會重申日人在華應審愼從事之必要實緣邇來尤其是東亞戰爭勃發以還日僑之行為頗不乏令人懷疑其是否深知重大責任者日本於此已處甚不利之地位上海領袖商人十四人於週二初次往游南京實可表示許多華人領袖對日本或南京政府之在華有何成就為如何疑惑</p>
<p>務向華人保證誠意</p>
<p>故日本以對華並無領土與物質圖謀為言時務必向華人羣眾保證其誠意而欲達此目的在華日僑咸應自動協助華人更瞭解日本之政策茍有日僑其行為不合日本所抱之目的則何能盼望華人信任日本之言行耶此言對於在華日僑固頗苛刻抑彼等茍不獲華人之信賴則極難在東亞建立新秩序之共榮圈</p>
<p>一切必須根本做起</p>
<p>在華之美英僑民現已失其往日之威望然許多華人似仍默處於英美宣傳勢力之下華人信賴之堅深由此可見日人如欲剷除東亞之美　勢力必須根本做起清除華人迄今仍信日英美之因素關於此點務須採取嚴厲行動使華大不復起美英之影響如取締短波收音機即其一端同時日人亦應竭力博取華人之合作</p>

<h3>吃耳光與笑（閒讀隨感）</h3>
<p>— 惰之餘</p>
<p>小丑們在舞臺上雖然佔不到甚麼地位然而卻始終為觀眾所歡迎—因為他們能風眾們笑暢快的開心一下娛樂原是解悶小丑們於這一點便傾力的做到了</p>
<p>小丑們博取到人們的笑法子確實是很多鼻子上按勞分配一塊白搖搖扇子說著詼諧的話是法子爬墻頭跳火車如羅克那樣做著滑稽的動作也是法子不過原則似乎只有一個就是扮小丑的要說出　不合情理的話做不合情理的動作</p>
<p>但說詼諧的話要轉念頭做滑稽的動作要費手腳為俄國神秘象徵派的安特列地在他的名劇吃耳光的人裹卻提供出了一一簡單的法子那就是一個小丑並不要甚麼武功也不要甚麼文才只要把臉伸出來讓舞臺上別的角色打他的耳光右耳光打過再讓人打左臉打了還要笑還對打的人鞠躬有一回這一個小丑吃了一百個耳光使觀眾們都稱心滿意哈哈的笑了而這位小丑也走了紅</p>
<p>不過如果這位小丑事情以自己身世的凄涼而一下悲痛的眞哭起來訴說自己下臺後不堪待遇的生活那麼說觀眾一定感到十分掃興的我想在觀眾羣中將會有人這樣的說大爺化錢是來尋樂的不是看你一副哭相</p>
<p>觀眾們不同情小丑這是不合情理的古羅馬帝皇看人與獸門誰都感到是殘酷的娛樂但我想看小丑吃耳光而笑得出的那也怕是屬於一種殘酷的欣賞的取樂</p>
<p>然而大家都不覺得在看完小丑吃耳光哈哈大笑之餘餘興還在的話或許人坑喊再亞個這大約是為了人們對有些不合情理的事　過慣了的緣故</p>
<h3>不能診斷的病</h3>
<p>— 之乎</p>
<p>從診察室中出來我始不疑是朋友安慰我故意淡然說我沒有病夜間　我再到一個不相熟的醫生那裹仍斷的結果也是沒有病</p>
<p>最近幾天來感到非常不舒服但又不能指出是一種什麼不舒服甚至可以說事整個身體機搆都發生窒息狀態可是在聽診器下證明我絕對沒有病</p>
<p>有位朋友說這是氣候關係人們經過一個夏天的大解放到了落木蕭蕭的秋天猶如一頭自由的烏突然關到籠子裹它雖然能夠飛能夠唱能夠飮食但是它級剝奪了自由人們從夏天到秋天就像頭烏關進籠子裹一樣醫生能診察你的身體但不能診察你的心理狀態</p>
<p>這是舉例而不量是由我想駁覆他但是我也沒有充份的反理由</p>
<h3>夜行</h3>
<p>— 佐拔</p>
<p>我們下課的時間是下午八點鐘</p>
<p>她和我是同級而且同路的每當下課以後總見她怱怱地回去走得比我快</p>
<p>昨夜下課因為防空演習的關係馬路上已是漆黑一團了我照例步行回家</p>
<p>佐拔突然一個聲音從後邊叫我道請你走得慢一些我們一道走罷</p>
<p>我看不見是誰但是我聽清是她</p>
<p>好的我說等了幾稍鐘處此的足音整齊了</p>
<p>燈火管制演習路上一燈一火都沒有了</p>
<p>連人影子也不容易看清啊她說</p>
<p>哦</p>
<p>下一次應該帶隻電筒來才好她又說</p>
<p>不必的我答道徐非長亮著否則非但自己還要使人家也弄得眼花瞭亂呢我們應該趁此機會訓練訓練眼睛今天世界的諸大都市如倫敦如柏林如巴黎如羅馬如莫斯維也納如如那一個不如吡呀</p>
<p>可是在黑暗中走路總究是很糟的</p>
<p>在鄉下走夜路的人也能過得可況我們都市是這麼好的平的正直的路呀在小地方走夜路沒有路燈人們都是仰頭看天的在兩邊的墻壁之中看出就是監暗的沉靜的天看著天走就不會碰壁了</p>
<p>那麼壞地方不會跌交麼所以是就熟路講的我答道</p>
<p>你是說這種黑暗的情形是會熟習起來的麼</p>
<p>不錯一切都會熟習起來的你不久就會熟習了正如一個不慣於走遠路的都市人到了鄉下動產豐富以無舟車可趁非走不可的時候也能走起遠路來的馘量樣的而且他多走了以後還以為這樣是多得了一種經騐呢</p>
<p>於是我伴十字街頭指揮交通的紅綠燈射過來眞舒服舒服尤其是光波比較長的綠燈使人疲勞的身體突然得到一種平衡的安慰</p>
<p>在黯音速看到一盞燈光好像特別快活她說</p>
<p>是的在寺炬通明的晚上人們並不愛惜燈光燈光的價值大半都被抹殺了那時候有許多燈光都是浪費了</p>
<p>紅綠燈很快地過過我們又在黑暗中趣聞許久</p>
<p>有幾分鐘的沉默她又說道</p>
<p>是的現在比剛從有光的課堂中出來的時候好多了那個時候連人影兒也不易看清現在可連人行道的高低也有見了</p>
<p>在黑暗中我聽見她的微笑是一種安慰的微笑而目是柔和的</p>
<h3>生與死</h3>
<p>— 楊志剛</p>
<p>最近在報紙上披露豐計多值得注意的新聞像嬰兒王殖率的顯著地減退以及和這相對的路斃棄嬰屍體的激增未已等還有些許多殯儀館傳來的消息近來亦都時常屍滿為患這些交織著的生和死的新聞正是反映現實社會的最好的縮圖</p>
<p>其中最使人們關心的事莫過於本埠出生嬰兒的劇遽的減少這生殖率的減退當然有它的現實的和複雜的客觀原因存在著但是這卻無疑是一個極嚴重的社會問題</p>
<p>近代史上亦有不少類似的事情當首次世界大戰展開直到大戰結束以後幾年間歐洲各國的嬰兒生育率亦曾遭到歷史上罕有的減退現象其中尤其是以英國為最甚</p>
<p>那時英國孟撤斯得導報曾經發表過一篇精闢的評論盲目地希望人口的增加正是野蠻人的迷信試問目前蕓蕓眾生食不飽肚衣不蔽體者比比皆是而終歲辛勞而不獲飽暖者為數尤眾增加這類為幸福的人羣究是缺少意義所以如何設法改善生活在這社會裹的人們的生活這個問題是無論如何比盲目地冀求生育率增加來得重要同時亦正是對生殖率減退對策的先決條件</p>
<p>我對此是非常同感對這名論起了強烈的共鳴</p>

<h3>Caucasus Soviet Counteroffensive in the North of Stalingrad, Fierce Battles, Germany Claims Soviet Troops Retreating from Several Locations</h3>
<p>German Führer's Headquarters, 8th, Renter News Agency</p>
<p>Today, the German military communiqué claimed that enemy advances in the Caucasus region were repelled, while our troops continued to penetrate enemy positions. Enemy troops in Stalingrad continued to retreat from several locations. Enemy troops encircled in the northwest have been annihilated. Shipping on the lower Volga River and in the Caspian Sea was also bombed. German troops east of Kaluga, in a surprise attack, captured a hill position from the enemy. Enemy troops entrenched in the forests south of Lake Ladoga have been driven out. Enemy counterattacks have all failed. Enemy attempts to cross the Neva River repeatedly have been repelled. The German Air Force continued to bomb the enemy's northern railway lines. Several strongholds of the enemy have been lost in Kandalaksha, Lapland.</p>
<p>Rome, 7th, Havas News Agency</p>
<p>An Italian war correspondent, recently returned from the Eastern Front, reports that the Red Army's ability to defend Stalingrad appears to have weakened slightly, with a gradual shortage of military equipment and ammunition, especially heavy artillery and tanks. However, the Red Army still holds the northern part of the city, supplied by paratroopers or small boats crossing the Volga River at night. However, the replenishment of tanks and heavy artillery is quite difficult, thus greatly affecting their resistance. According to a report from the Giornale d'Italia, German and Italian forces in the Don River region have used incendiary bombs to great effect against Soviet tanks. However, in recent days, a large number of new Soviet tanks have arrived, moving very quickly and able to pass unscathed through the fire lines laid by incendiary bombs. At the same time, the Red Army in Stalingrad continues to use artillery units on the left bank of the Volga River to constantly bombard German positions, and it is difficult for the advancing German troops to make contact with the German artillery units, so they cannot retaliate.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 7th, Central News Agency</p>
<p>German forces have concentrated artillery fire for four days, fiercely attacking the factory zone northwest of Stalingrad. According to a United Press Moscow dispatch, German forces continue to reinforce with transport planes. Engineering and construction battalions that previously participated in the attack on Sevastopol have also joined the battle, launching dozens of fierce attacks on Soviet troops with the cooperation of German tanks and infantry.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Central Political Conference</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 8th, Central News Agency</p>
<p>The Central Political Conference held its 113th meeting at 9:00 AM on the 8th. Chairman Wang Zhaoming (A) reported briefly on matters. (B) Matters for discussion: (1) The Chairman submitted for discussion a case from the Executive Yuan, based on a report from the Ministry of Finance, stating that the implementation of increased official salaries for central government agencies will soon reach one year, and that current prices continue to rise. In order to encourage civil servants to work with peace of mind, it is proposed to grant a temporary additional doubling of salaries from November of this year, based on the previous year's increase method. Public servants will also receive an additional 80% as originally planned, and seven restrictive measures will be established to avoid further increasing the burden on the national treasury. The case was submitted for review and decision. The resolution was passed and sent to the National Government for implementation. (2) The Chairman submitted for discussion a case from the Executive Yuan, based on a report from the Ministry of Finance, consulting the provincial government on a proposal to increase the silk improvement fee in accordance with the example of silkworm silk, and to levy a supplementary local silk improvement fee and special tax. Considering that this matter involves changing tax rates and increasing the burden on the people, it should first be submitted to the councilors of this Yuan for review and signature, and then the two ministries of Finance and Industry should jointly review and propose opinions to the National Government for approval. The resolution was passed at the 131st Yuan meeting and the case was recorded and submitted for review. The resolution was passed and the Legislative Yuan was instructed to revise the "Provisional Regulations on the Dried Indigo Tax in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces" with reference to the revisions.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Executive Yuan Orders Prohibition of Rice Merchants Spreading Rumors</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 8th, Central News Agency</p>
<p>Executive Yuan Instruction (No. 588) orders Zhou Xuechang, Mayor of Nanjing Special City, and Deng Zuyu, Chief of the Capital Police Headquarters, to strictly enforce the grain control policy. This is because the government, in view of the serious situation and the insufficiency of domestically produced rice, established the Grain Management Committee to manage national grain administration regarding production, sales, and prices in a comprehensive manner, in order to balance supply and demand and ensure an equal distribution of food for the people. Since its implementation, it has had considerable success. It is reported that recently, unscrupulous rice merchants in the capital city have arbitrarily spread rumors against the control policy. Some gentry, not understanding the meaning of the system and not recognizing the needs of the times, have echoed their sentiments, advocating for the unscrupulous merchants and creating all kinds of seemingly plausible arguments to confuse public opinion and disrupt people's minds. Such deliberate sabotage, hostile to the people's food supply, is extremely reprehensible. It must be known that in the past, rice merchants could hoard and speculate, trade freely, and prices could rise and fall arbitrarily, with generous profits and personal gain at the expense of the people. This was already inconvenient in normal times, but it is even more unacceptable in the current situation to sit idly by while they harm the people and benefit themselves. Now that control has been returned to the government, the people can share the joys and sorrows equally, while these people cannot maintain their undue advantages. If these people are allowed to spread rumors and deceive the public to achieve their selfish goals, the future of the people's food supply will be even more unbearable. The Mayor and the Chief of the Capital Police Headquarters should jointly issue a clear proclamation, strictly prohibiting unscrupulous merchants from spreading rumors and causing trouble. If anyone dares to deliberately violate the order, they will be punished severely as saboteurs of the grain policy and monopolizers of the people's food supply, and those who spread rumors and cause trouble should be secretly investigated and punished to the full extent of the law to emphasize the importance of grain security and maintain the people's food supply. In addition to distribution, it is ordered to comply with this order and report the compliance situation.</p>

<h3>Rumor that Stanley Proposed a New Agreement Between Three Countries, Soviet Union Proposed Military Committee, Requests that the United Kingdom and the United States Will Agree</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th, Central News Agency</p>
<p>According to the Yomiuri Hochi, a special telegram from Argentina to Seoul states that U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Stanley has decided to return home immediately to report on his duties after Stalin issued a statement. Therefore, the future direction of relations between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union is worthy of attention. A telegram from Washington states that Stanley has advised Roosevelt that, in order to win over the Soviet Union, the United States should conclude a new agreement between the three countries to improve joint operations against Germany.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 7th, Central News Agency</p>
<p>According to Reuters Moscow, U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Stanley recently decided to return home within three days to report to Roosevelt and paid a special visit to Stalin on the 7th for a meeting.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 8th, Renter News Agency</p>
<p>According to London news, British人士 have begun to discuss Stalin's request for the establishment of an Allied military committee and no longer discuss the issue of a second front. The United Kingdom and the United States have weighed the pros and cons and chosen the easier option to implement. U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union General Stanley may be carrying Stalin's advice to the defeated generals in Viesfor. London insiders believe that the United Kingdom and the United States will agree to establish a military committee and send representatives from the Soviet Union as well, in order to ease the atmosphere in Moscow. However, neither Roosevelt nor Churchill intends to abandon military leadership, and the differences of opinion between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union may become more and more apparent. Currently, Soviet newspapers continue to criticize the failure of the United Kingdom and the United States to fulfill their promises of aid to the Soviet Union, and the newspapers also publish satirical cartoons.</p>
<h3>Reduced Military Aid, Dissatisfaction with the United States in Various Countries</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 7th, Havas News Agency</p>
<p>The Basler National-Zeitung recently published a dispatch from its London correspondent stating that the written statement recently issued by Stalin to American reporters was purely to express the Soviet Union's dissatisfaction with the current policy adopted by the United States. The Soviet Ambassador to the United States recently went to the State Department to lodge a protest, demanding that the United States change its policy. The Soviet Ambassador believes that the United Kingdom and the United States should immediately muster the courage to formulate a bolder operational plan. In the past, American soldiers had a creed that the United States could only launch an offensive after working with its allies, but at this time, they seem to have abandoned this view, and the isolationism commonly seen in the political world seems to have spread to military leaders. Until the United States entered the war, the U.S. policy was to supply military equipment to its allies in accordance with the provisions of the Lend-Lease Act. However, today, due to the United States' own need for a large amount of military equipment to build a large army, the amount of military equipment supplied has also been reduced to a minimum. The military authorities have now decided on a quota for military equipment exports, so the allies are all dissatisfied with this situation and believe that their needs should not be sacrificed due to the U.S. military reorganization plan. The issue of opening a second battlefield is closely related to the issue of supplying military equipment and other necessities to the allies. Therefore, the current attitude of the United States is quite unpopular with the allies.</p>
<h3>Germany Announces List of British Ships Sunk</h3>

<p>Stockholm, 8th, Renter News Agency</p>
<p>Canadian Prime Minister King announced yesterday the reorganization of the cabinet. Canadian legal persons joined the cabinet. The former Deputy Minister of National Defense for Army, LaFleche, was promoted to minister. Fournier was appointed Minister of Public Works.

<h3>Danish Political Situation Still Tense</h3>
<p>Copenhagen, 7th, Havas News Agency</p>

At the same time, the Berlin official did not criticize Danish Prime Minister Buhl's speech yesterday, but it has gained the impression that Denmark is likely to participate in the new European organization.</p>

<h3>Willkie Has Left Chongqing, Met with Stilwell Again Before Departure</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 8th, Domei News Agency</p>
<p>According to a message from Chongqing, Roosevelt's personal envoy Willkie flew from Chongqing yesterday afternoon. This news was not allowed to be published in the newspapers until today. Willkie had a second meeting with Lieutenant General Stilwell, commander of the U.S. forces in the Chongqing area, at noon on Tuesday, lasting about twenty minutes.</p>
<p>Published Views on Visits to Various Countries</p>
<p>Lisbon, 7th, Domei News Agency</p>
<p>U.S. Envoy Willkie issued another statement in Chongqing on the 7th, saying that this statement was to explain his personal views and called for an active offensive against the Axis. At the same time, he admitted that the distribution of armaments by the United Nations was unfair. The general idea of his statement was: "Since I departed from the United States, I have visited thirteen countries and carefully examined the current situation of the governments and peoples of these countries. The people of these United Nations have three hopes: (1) Victory of the United Nations; (2) Launching an active offensive against the Axis immediately; (3) Freedom and independence after the war. However, after the war, it is doubtful whether the major democratic countries will actually respect the freedom and independence of other countries. However, what I have gained from this trip is that a defensive war will hardly be won, and the benefits to the American people have been repeatedly announced to the world in numbers regarding the increase in domestic production. However, some United Nations claim that the armaments sent by the United States are very few. If this is considered a disruption to American production, it is not necessarily unreasonable. The United Nations should adopt appropriate plans to allocate the armaments equally to the Soviet Union and Chongqing. However, it is difficult to win by only providing weapons. We must have hope for the future. Some people in the United Nations doubt the attitude of the major democratic countries towards freedom and independence after the war, which is enough to make the countries lose their enthusiasm for actively cooperating in the war. It is extremely difficult for us to win without the support of the general allies. Some people have held talks with me and expressed their displeasure with the American so-called Atlantic Charter. They have raised the question of whether the countries that signed the Atlantic Charter agree that the charter applies to the Atlantic? The United States should issue a simple and clear statement to help me answer."</p>
<h3>British Forces Occupy Two Cities in Southwest Madagascar</h3>
<p>Vichy, 7th, Havas News Agency</p>

<h3>Blackout Achieves Satisfactory Results, Air Raid Drill Has Ended, Authorities Issue Communiqué Expressing Satisfaction</h3>
<p>Domei News Agency, This Port - The blackout training period ended last night. The Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Command expressed satisfaction with the significant improvement of this passive defense measure. The blackout training ended last night, two days earlier than the originally scheduled ten-day period. The Air Defense Command issued a communiqué last night stating that the results of the blackout exercises conducted after dark fully reflected the Shanghai residents' understanding of the current situation and their sincerity in cooperation. Blackout in the French Concession and the Public Concession was very good. The Chinese areas and the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek were also quite good. The Public Concession has undergone strict supervision by the relevant authorities in recent days, and the blackout measures have been significantly improved and are quite satisfactory. However, residents in the Yangshupu District and the area west of Wing On Company still need to pay attention to improving blackout measures, while blackout in the Nanshi and Pudong areas is not effective and special attention must be paid in the future. The communiqué further enumerated the following points that can make the city's air defense measures perfect: (1) Residents must pay attention to distinguishing the three stages of preparation, alert, and air raid control. During the preparation blackout, business must continue as usual, and the purpose of the alert blackout is not to suspend any business. (2) All residents who have not prepared for defense and have not made preparations to shield window lights must take appropriate defensive and shielding measures. Light bulbs should be removed from lights that are not commonly used. (3) The back of houses and patios are most likely to leak light and must be given special attention. (4) Automobile lights must also be given attention. Generally speaking, the control of front lights is satisfactory, but the rear lights are not. (5) Residents must be prepared at all times to quickly implement all blackout measures within seconds after an alarm is issued. Anyone who takes a long time to prepare should prepare in advance so that they can implement them immediately upon receiving notification. (6) Some street lights have too much reflection, and their strong light is reflected into the sky from the walls. Further research will be conducted on this point. The results of radio broadcasting control during the eight-day training period were also satisfactory.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Households Penalized for Violations</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the French Concession Police Department took strict measures to implement its warning to residents to abide by the blackout regulations. On Monday and Tuesday nights, hundreds of households were penalized for violations by cutting off their electricity for several hours to the entire night. So far, the authorities have not imposed fines on violators in accordance with the French Consulate General's air defense proclamation. However, the French Police Department is working closely with the Baojia system to warn violators and inform them of the best ways to shield lights in their homes to prevent them from leaking.</p>
<p>Fire Drill Achieves Good Results</p>
<p>The English-language Great American Evening News reports that Mr. Matsudaira, Deputy Director of the Police Department's Traffic Bureau and Director of the Defense Committee, praised the Baojia personnel for their enthusiastic participation in the first simulated air raid fire drill held this afternoon (8th). It is said that the Baojia personnel, who had only received two or three days of training, performed well in the drill held on Putuo Road yesterday, and the fire brigade once again proved to be a very effective group. Since the Baojia personnel were participating in a fire drill for the first time, there was no shortage of areas for improvement. After more drills, it will be even more effective. The rescue work of the Baojia personnel was also very satisfactory. They helped to carry the injured to the side of the street, where they were transferred to the first aid station by the health department. Their work was commendable. Fire drills will continue to be held in other areas of the city, and this special work training is currently being carried out among the Baojia personnel.</p>
<h3>Baojia Fund-Raising Propaganda Music Concert</h3>

<h3>Western Newspapers Eagerly Encourage Japanese Residents in China, While the Continental New Report Makes a Profound Warning; The Times Elaborates and Encourages</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Times published an editorial titled "A Warning to Japanese in China," stating that a recent editorial in the Japanese-language Continental New Report issued a significant and earnest warning to Japanese residents in China, urging them not to treat Chinese people as if they were conquerors. It quoted an ancient Japanese proverb that even conquerors should tighten their armor. Japanese in China should uphold this spirit and conduct themselves with courtesy in their daily lives, refraining from arrogant behavior towards the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Hoping Not to Repeat the Mistakes of Britain and America</p>
<p>The purpose of the current war should not be overlooked; it goes without saying that Japanese should be vigilant in preventing a repetition of the mistakes made by the United States and Britain in China. If Japan merely replaces the old British and American influence in China, most of its war efforts will have been in vain. Japan's true wish is to help China become independent and cooperate with Japan to break free from British and American shackles and achieve lasting peace and prosperity for the nations of Asia.</p>
<p>Should Strengthen China's Power</p>
<p>Therefore, Japan should strengthen China's power and not deliberately hinder the continuation and growth of China's economy and defense capabilities. To help China become stronger, a new situation must be established that eliminates imperialist aggression, so that the Chinese people can use their natural abilities to seek the greatest benefits for their country and the world. If Japan mistakenly takes another step towards imperialism, it will become a second Britain and America in China and defeat its own purpose.</p>
<p>Japanese Residents Should Know They Bear Great Responsibility</p>
<p>We would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the need for Japanese residents in China to act with caution. In recent times, especially since the outbreak of the East Asian War, the behavior of Japanese residents has raised doubts as to whether they fully understand their important responsibilities. The fact that fourteen leading merchants from Shanghai visited Nanjing for the first time on Tuesday may indicate the doubts that many Chinese leaders have about Japan or the achievements of the Nanjing government in China.</p>
<p>Must Assure the Chinese People of Their Sincerity</p>
<p>Therefore, when Japan states that it has no territorial or material ambitions in China, it must assure the Chinese people of its sincerity. To achieve this goal, all Japanese residents in China should voluntarily help the Chinese people understand Japan's policies better. If some Japanese residents behave in ways that contradict Japan's stated goals, how can it be hoped that the Chinese people will trust Japan's words and actions? This may sound harsh to Japanese residents in China, but if they do not gain the trust of the Chinese people, it will be extremely difficult to establish a new order of co-prosperity in East Asia.</p>
<p>Everything Must Start from the Ground Up</p>
<p>American and British residents in China have now lost their former prestige, but many Chinese people still seem to be silently under the influence of British and American propaganda. The depth of Chinese trust in them is evident. If the Japanese want to eliminate American and British influence in East Asia, they must start from the ground up, eliminating the factors that still cause the Chinese to trust Britain and America. Strict measures must be taken to prevent the resurgence of American and British influence, such as banning shortwave radios. At the same time, Japanese should also strive to win the cooperation of the Chinese people.</p>
<h3>Japanese Go Masters Visit Chinese Chess Friends</h3>
<p>Japanese Go masters Sakata Eio, Wu Qingyuan, both 8-dan, and Hashimoto Utaro, 7-dan, were invited by the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association to come to Shanghai. The local chess community welcomed them. Wu Qingyuan's name is well-known to the Chinese people, and Sakata Eio and Hashimoto Utaro are also prominent figures in the Japanese chess world. Fourteen years ago, they came to Shanghai as tourists, and Zhang Danru hosted a banquet for them, expressing his respect. Now, Sakata and others have returned to Shanghai, and their skills are even more advanced than before. Old friends met again, and they happily reminisced about the past, their feelings sincere. Yesterday, Sakata and the others, together with Wu Qingyuan and Hashimoto, drove to Zhang's residence to inquire about his illness and express their concern and care over the past ten years. They also presented Zhang with a 4-dan certificate from the Japanese Go Institute. The Japanese chess community is very strict in awarding ranks, and Zhang's receipt of this honor is a wonderful story in the Sino-Japanese chess world.</p>

<h3>Record of Rongwu Society Sutra Lecture</h3>
<p>In the 67th lecture of the Rongwu Society Sutra Lecture, Mr. Shen Jueling lectured on the differences between the scriptures and commentaries in "Essentials for Studying the Book of Changes." Yunhan Shuyi Wenzhi Book of Changes 12 chapters complete Shanghai classics Confucius' ten wings, commentary, upper biography, family upper biography, image upper biography, image divination, clean words upper biography, commentary divination, text blind biography, gossip biography, sequence biography, miscellaneous gossip biography ten chapters as twelve chapters Although collectively referred to as scriptures, the commentaries and the scriptures are separate. Zhu Liu originally used Wang Bi's Book of Changes, that is, Zheng Kangcheng, according to Fei Zhi, to attach the biography to the scripture, the biography of Xiang Shang, Xiang Bu Xiang Shang Xiang Bu Xiang Wenyan attached to the scripture, and the remaining five biographies are still separated from the scripture. In the Song Dynasty, Zhu Zi used Lu Zuliang's version to restore the old eleven chapters. In the Qing Dynasty, Zhouyi Zhongzhong used Benyi, Benyi first, then Cheng biography, then Jishuo, collected from the imperial editions from Han to Ming, and recorded Benyi below the Zhu Liu Ben, thinking that it was not Benyi. The annotation of Benyi is clear that it is not the original of Benyi. It is the most confusing. Those who study the Book of Changes take Li Yi... Fengguo... I heard... Zhao</p>

<h3>The Bond Market Is Unpredictable</h3>
<p>Over-the-counter trading in public bonds was still quite busy yesterday. The market price fluctuated by about 2 yuan. Initially, the bulls raised prices, and then many bulls emerged. Afterwards, retail investors absorbed the bonds, so the price fluctuated. Type C bonds were the most popular, changing hands several times at the 60 yuan level. Sellers were slightly more dominant. Type C bonds once fell below 59 yuan, seeing a low price of 58.8 yuan. Although they broke through 60 yuan several times, they were still at 59.5 yuan afterwards. People in the industry had different opinions and reasons, so it is still difficult to predict the future of the market price. Type A bonds were still outside 60 yuan at 60.01 yuan. Type B bonds were at 59 yuan, Type D at 56.6 yuan, and Type E bonds at 57.5 yuan. As a result, except for Type A bonds, which rose by 1 jiao, the rest all fell by small amounts of 2 jiao to 5 jiao.</p>

<h3>Cotton Cloth Not Very Prosperous, Only East Coupon Bank Notes Are Popular</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market was firm and stable, neither prosperous nor declining. Although actual sales were still sluggish, the underlying trend was upward. The prices of various cloths were as follows: 16-pound Earth coarse cloth 190 yuan, Tai Feng 190 yuan, Flying Hong 187 yuan. 9-pound New Character coarse cloth 110.5 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong 107.5 yuan, 12-pound D.P.C. fine cloth 162 yuan, Dapeng New Single 60 yuan, Fugui 155 yuan.

<p>East Cloth</p>
<p>The market is still in a state of flux. However, the recent trend is that bank warehouse receipts south of Suzhou River are becoming scarce. In the past, buyers were often concerned that bank receipts stored in warehouses for too long might be moldy or damaged. Now, they no longer hesitate, which shows a change in perception. Yesterday, 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth, Sincere Single, was 168 yuan, with little change, but the bank notes were more actively traded. The closing price at noon was 159 yuan, continuing to rise by 2.5 jiao. Colored Ball fine cloth was 158 yuan, down 2.5 jiao. Flying Fish 156 yuan, Yang Suzhu 154.5 yuan. Four Gentlemen Serge red coupons had very few transactions, closing at 6.92 yuan at noon, down 2 fen, but bank serge rose to 6.8 yuan, an increase of 5 fen, and the price has gradually leveled off.</p>
<h3>New Beans Arrive in Shanghai, and Transactions Become Active</h3>
<p>Recently, beans have become more active because new products have been successively produced in various suburban areas, and peddlers have been trying to transport them to Shanghai. However, the market situation is still firm. Pudong Du beans 30 bags priced at 235 yuan, Pinghu black beans 10 bags priced at 220 yuan, Wujiang picked green 50 bags priced at 100 yuan, Tianjin red beans 20 bags priced at 169 yuan, Chongming new sand silkworms 50 bags priced at 151 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, dried sweet potatoes were still firm and rising. Qingdao dried sweet potatoes more than 30 bags priced at 141 yuan.</p>
<p>Bean cakes have recently been gradually increasing in transactions as new goods have been coming on the market. The market has been rising due to high expectations. Yesterday, Changji bean cakes opened at 1,000 pieces priced at 64.5 to 60 yuan. Feizi bean cakes three vehicles priced at 65.5 to 66 yuan.</p>
<h3>Ornaments and Discount Rates Remain Unchanged</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of ornaments sold by jewelry stores in Shanghai was still 2,450 yuan per tael (about 300 yuan less for purchases). The price of inter-dealer trading first varied and then slightly recovered. The morning price was 2,240 yuan, 20 yuan higher. The Russian market rose to 2,255 yuan, and those who saw the high price sold, and the price fell back slightly by 25 yuan, to 2,230 yuan. The price of silver for ornaments was still 14 yuan per tael. The price of inter-dealer trading was 13.5 yuan, slightly weaker.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate of the Money Industry Association remained unchanged at 1 jiao and 4 fen. Also, the total number of bills exchanged in Shanghai in September was 231,440, with an amount of 222,326,667 yuan.</p>
<h3>Industry Briefs</h3>
<p>Daily Use Soap Sells Well</p>
<p>The market for daily necessities such as soap continues to rise. Match prices once rose sharply, but transactions cooled off yesterday. Phoenix brand 2,200 yuan, Beauty brand 2,400 yuan, Golden Tripod brand 2,150 yuan, miscellaneous brands 1,700 yuan. The prices were quite similar to the previous prices. Guyuan soap 325 yuan, Bai Xiangmao soap 265 yuan, Huang Xiangmao soap 225 yuan, Scissor soap 280 yuan. The price of Whiteley's candles remained high at 145 yuan. The pharmaceutical market, such as Bagua Dan, was slightly prosperous, priced at 18 yuan. Headache powder 22 yuan, Universal Oil 21.5 yuan, Partridge Vegetable 56 yuan, Dragon and Tiger Ren Dan 13 yuan. There were no changes.</p>
<p>Fragrant mushrooms are not pure, but the market inventory is relatively sufficient, so the recent trend has been to remedy the situation. Now, they are selling for 3,200 to 4,500 yuan. However, the stock of high-quality fragrant mushrooms from the east is rare, and the price remains high, selling for up to 8,500 yuan, which is relatively firm.</p>
<p>Longan Meat Rising</p>
<p>Recently, there have been more new goods arriving, but in some cases, the bills of lading have not arrived, and the goods cannot be picked up temporarily, so the spot goods are still scarce. Yesterday, the market opened and rose by another 50 yuan. The market is tight.</p>

<h3>Slap and Laugh (Random Reading Thoughts)</h3>
<p>— In addition to idleness</p>
<p>Although clowns do not occupy a very important position on the stage, they are always welcomed by the audience - because they can make the audience laugh heartily and relieve boredom. Clowns have done their best in this respect.</p>
<p>Clowns have many ways to get people to laugh. Pressing a piece of white on the nose and shaking a fan while saying humorous words is one way. Climbing walls and jumping on trains, like Rock, doing funny actions is also a way. But the principle seems to be only one, that is, the clown has to say unreasonable words and do unreasonable actions.</p>
<p>But saying humorous words requires turning your mind, and doing funny actions requires effort. For the Russian mystic symbolist, Andreyeve, in his famous play "The Slap in the Face," provided a simple way: a clown does not need any martial arts or literary talent. He just needs to stick out his face and let the other characters on the stage slap him. After the right ear is slapped, let others slap the left face. After being slapped, he has to laugh and bow to the slapper. Once, this clown was slapped a hundred times, which made the audience feel satisfied and laugh out loud, and this clown became popular.</p>
<p>However, if this clown suddenly starts crying sadly because of his own miserable life experience and complains about his intolerable life after stepping down from the stage, then the audience will definitely feel very disappointed. I think someone in the audience will say something like this: "I paid to have fun, not to see you crying."</p>
<p>Audiences do not sympathize with clowns. This is unreasonable. Ancient Roman emperors felt that watching people and beasts fight was a cruel form of entertainment. But I think those who can laugh after watching a clown being slapped are also indulging in a kind of cruel appreciation for entertainment.</p>
<p>However, everyone does not feel this way. After watching the clown being slapped and laughing heartily, if the excitement is still there, perhaps someone will shout, "Another one!" This is probably because people are used to some unreasonable things.</p>
<h3>A Disease That Cannot Be Diagnosed</h3>
<p>— Zhihu</p>
<p>Coming out of the consulting room, I did not doubt that my friend comforted me and deliberately said indifferently that I was not sick. At night, I went to an unfamiliar doctor, and the result was still that I was not sick.</p>
<p>I have been feeling very uncomfortable for the past few days, but I cannot point out what kind of discomfort it is. I can even say that the entire physical mechanism is suffocating, but under the stethoscope, it proves that I am definitely not sick.</p>
<p>A friend said that this is due to the climate. After a summer of great liberation, people feel like they are entering a cage, just like a free crow suddenly being locked in a cage in the bleak autumn. Although it can fly, sing, and eat, it is deprived of its freedom. People feel like crows being locked in cages from summer to autumn. Doctors can diagnose your body, but they cannot diagnose your mental state.</p>
<p>This is an example, and it is not measured by my wanting to refute him, but I do not have sufficient reasons to refute him.</p>
<h3>Night Walk</h3>
<p>— Zoba</p>
<p>Our class ends at 8 p.m.</p>
<p>She and I are in the same grade and go the same way. Whenever class ends, I always see her rushing back, walking faster than me.</p>
<p>Last night, because of an air-raid drill, the streets were pitch black. As usual, I walked home.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a voice called me from behind, "Zoba, please walk slower. Let's walk together."</p>
<p>I couldn't see who it was, but I heard her clearly.</p>
<p>"Okay," I said, waiting for a few minutes until her footsteps caught up.</p>
<p>During the blackout drill, there were no lights on the road.</p>
<p>"It's not easy to even see people's shadows," she said.</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>"We should bring a flashlight next time," she added.</p>
<p>"There's no need," I replied. "Unless it's always on, otherwise it will not only blind yourself, but also make others dizzy. We should take this opportunity to train our eyes. Every major city in the world today, such as London, Berlin, Paris, Rome, Moscow, Vienna, etc., is practicing."</p>
<p>"But walking in the dark is always terrible."</p>
<p>"People who walk at night in the countryside can manage it. Moreover, our city has such good, flat, and straight roads. In small places, people walking at night have no street lights, so they look up at the sky. Between the walls on both sides, what they see is the dark, silent sky. If you walk while looking at the sky, you won't bump into anything."</p>
<p>"So you won't stumble in bad places?"</p>
<p>"So it's just for familiar roads that I can answer," I replied.</p>
<p>"Are you saying that people can get used to this kind of darkness?"</p>
<p>"That's right. Everything can be gotten used to. You will soon get used to it, just like a city dweller who is not used to walking long distances. When he arrives in the countryside, where production is abundant and there is no boat or car to take, he has to walk. And after walking more, he will think that he has gained a kind of experience."</p>
<p>Then, the traffic lights shining over the intersection made me feel so comfortable, especially the green light with a longer wavelength, which suddenly gave my tired body a kind of balanced comfort.</p>
<p>"Seeing a light in the darkness seems particularly happy," she said.</p>
<p>"Yes, on nights with bright lights, people don't cherish the lights. Most of the value of the lights is obliterated. At that time, many lights are wasted."</p>
<p>The traffic lights quickly passed, and we ventured in the dark for a long time.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of silence, she said again.</p>
<p>"Yes, it's much better now than when we just came out of the brightly lit classroom. At that time, it wasn't easy to see even people's shadows. Now, you can even see the height of the sidewalks."</p>
<p>In the darkness, I heard her smile, a comforting smile, and it was gentle.</p>
<h3>Life and Death</h3>
<p>— Yang Zhigang</p>
<p>Recently, newspapers have revealed many noteworthy news items, such as the significant decline in infant birth rates, and in contrast, the unabated surge in the number of abandoned infant corpses. Furthermore, there have been frequent reports from funeral parlors indicating that they are often overcrowded with corpses. These interwoven news stories of life and death are the best reflection of the reality of society.</p>
<p>Among them, the most concerning issue is the drastic decrease in the number of infants born in this city. The decline in birth rates certainly has its realistic and complex objective reasons. However, it is undoubtedly a very serious social problem.</p>
<p>There have been many similar events in modern history. During the First World War and for several years after its end, the infant birth rates in various European countries also experienced a historically rare decline, especially in Britain.</p>
<p>At that time, the Manchester Guardian published a profound commentary stating that blindly hoping for population growth is a barbarian superstition. The question is, are there not countless people who are underfed and poorly clothed, and even more who toil year-round without warmth or nourishment? Adding to this population of unhappy people is of little significance. Therefore, how to find ways to improve the lives of people in this society is, in any case, more important than blindly hoping for an increase in birth rates. At the same time, it is also a prerequisite for addressing the decline in birth rates.</p>
<p>I strongly agree with this and deeply resonate with this famous argument.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat in Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jiazhai</p>
<p>(10) Flying Peak</p>
<p>Wei Shaoyun fell backward. He was supposed to fall suddenly. The force of the oncoming person's punch, with that weight, would have made a loud "thud" sound, conveying the sound waves to the east room, startling Little Zhuge and his group to their feet. But Wei Shaoyun fell without making a sound. Why was that? The assailant darted over, clenched his fist, and punched down, while using his left hand to slowly cradle Wei Shaoyun's neck, letting him fall to the ground. Didn't that prevent the sound from happening? This blow made Wei Shaoyun's eyes blur and his ears ring. He couldn't hear anything anymore. A mouthful of blood spurted out of his mouth. He unconsciously cried out in pain. As soon as he opened his mouth with that blood, the assailant seemed to be prepared, stuffing a wad of cotton into Wei Shaoyun's mouth in the blink of an eye. Wei Shaoyun passed out, and he had no chance to cry out again.</p>
<p>Cui Zhen, on the bed, didn't know who had come. She only saw Wei Shaoyun fall down. She thought, "Could it be someone resorting to violence to resolve a dispute, someone jealous and competing with Wei Shaoyun for my affection?" But then she looked again and saw that the person had a shaved head and was wearing a set of coarse blue clothes, looking like a worker. On his face, in a fit of rage, several veins were bulging. Not menacing, but heroic. Cui Zhen suddenly understood that it was Huang Long. As soon as she opened her mouth, Huang Long quickly and quietly said, "Don't speak!" As he spoke, he picked up one of Wei Shaoyun's arms that had fallen to the ground, intending to lift him over with great energy. Some lifting over, he still threw his arm away, stepped to the front of the bed, and hurriedly untied the ropes on Cui Zhen's hands and feet. He softly said, "Sit up, let's go. What are we waiting for?" Cui Zhen stretched her hands and feet and shook her head, saying, "I've become a cripple. My hands and feet are numb." Huang Long never knew how to be polite with people. He tugged on Cui Zhen's hand. Cui Zhen borrowed some momentum and sat up, asking, "Are there people outside their door who can walk?" (198)</p>
