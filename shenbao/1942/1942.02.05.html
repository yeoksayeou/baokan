<h3>柑橘（二）</h3>

<h3>吃年夜飯與戒殺生</h3>
<p>— 寥霂</p>
<p>「凄風苦雨愁煞人」，在夏曆的歲暮年終度此景象，眞有佛曰「不可說」之感；然而時間不肯讓人，終於曾經輕輕地飄過，叉悄悄地一度來臨了。昨天是「立春」，我們不久就要迎接「春節」。</p>
<p>在通常時候，一年辛苦，稍歇下來點綴點綴，謝年祭祖之下，一家團聚快快活活吃年夜飯，也是人生之一樂。數杯濁酒，幾味膾羹，在人情上講，誰也不敢說是太浪費，也自有它令節的意義。即使是表現得闊綽一些，殺一些雞鴨，煮若干魚肉，托神靈祖宗之福，也彷彿是熙熙攘攘者應有之權利。</p>
<p>然而時至今日，令節當前，如要多分我一杯羹，不能免俗來奉行一番，我想一班平糴米者眞要大皺其眉，徒作苦笑而已，這和一些嚴肅的佛家與革命家，雖有若干的距離，然而「山梁雌雉，時哉時哉」，也是彼一時也，此一時也。</p>
<p>有些人還歡喜硬起頭皮來奉行故事，大吃其年夜飯，不肯從事於節約運動；但度此良宵，明日如何？於是不敢太樂天的就應該打算打算良宵佳節之後也要支撑生活一下。鬼神之事，藐乎遠矣；口福之樂，祇度眼前。——這就叫人引起一種特殊的情感來。</p>
<p>中敎道義會在提倡戒殺而救生，救物而救人，雖然或有以為是老生常談，但體味之下，今日確有其意義。「東鄰殺牛不如西鄰之淪祭」淪祭者，煮蔬菜以祭也，亦勉力之祭也。愼終追遠，自不可忘其根本，亦更要抱着「悲天憫人，物傷其類」的觀念。苦中作樂，有些難堪；節省糜費，還可做些有益於人之事。</p>
<p>淸彭際淸除夕有感詩云：「鄰雞夜夜競先鳴，到此蕭然度五更；血染千刀流不盡，佐他杯酒話春生。」我亦有簫然之感也，悲哉！</p>

<p>「我……已經……很……很需要有……有一個永……永久……的歸宿……歸宿了！」秋海棠的聲音是低得像耳語一樣。「孩子……，我所……所放心不下……下……的就是……你還沒……沒有……一……一個暫時的……歸宿……。」</p>
<p>說着，他就從枕頭下面慢慢地抽出一張照片來。</p>
<p>「對於你……，」他用一雙毫無精神的眼珠，看定着這一張十幾年來從沒有同他離開過的照片，斷斷續續的說：「我……我也是……覺……覺得很……很對不起……的。當初……，我原……是……是為了……不願……讓……你……你看見我……我這一張……醜……臉……，又不……不願使……使你……你隨着……我……吃苦……，才硬……硬生生地……避……避開了你……你。現在……現在是……懊悔……也來不及了……。」</p>
<p>梅寳看他說得很吃力，忙斟了半杯開水，和着那個大夫所留下的止喘藥，收住眼淚，走上去喂給他吃，一面還把他手裏所捧着的那張照片接了過去。</p>
<p>「爸爸，歇息歇息吧！明兒咱們一定再去換請一個更好的大夫來，隨便怎樣，總要把你的病看好。」梅寳很穉氣地說。（三二五）</p>
<h3>「聞雞起舞」</h3>

<p>報載：「各娛樂塲所因提早打烊後，損失重大，特聯合向當局呈請，在節電原則下，酌將營業時間延長。」</p>
<p>報載：「當局重申前令，娛樂塲所打烊時間，仍嚴限每晚十時前。」</p>
<p>報載：「新發明晨餐舞，每天上午九時起。」</p>
<p>對於上海的跳舞塲經營商人，我們不得不佩服，為了替自己營業打算，為了替大衆謀幸福，（娛樂是每個人調劑疲乏的必需品，謂之曰「大衆幸福」，想非溢譽。）不惜去碰那麼一惆大釘子。但是略為動動腦筋，便繼着午餐舞，茶舞，晚舞之後，而產生了晨餐舞，隨時隨地，欲舞則舞，於是營業收入增加，而大衆亦莫不稱便。</p>
<p>俗言「大腹善賈」，像發明晨餐舞的商人，應該算是「善」之時者也。在生意眼和適應現環境兩個觀點上看來，晨餐舞自有其價値；因為夜市旣吿消滅，人們的睡眠必然增多，睡眠和喫飯一樣，喫飯過飽，反足傷胃，睡眠過多，也足以使頭腦昏糊，這麼一來，早起之後便可到舞場裏去跳上一兩小時「醒腦舞」，順便進早餐，兩得其所，保證一天精神健旺。跳舞一事，據說是有寓運動於娛樂的意義，但願上海仕女們都去跳舞，因跳舞可早起，因早起可增強體格，「晨餐舞」，僅在舞的程序中「聊備一格」，却另有莫大之助焉。</p>
<p>新鐘點實行之後，九點就是八點，從茲以往，在晨光曦微中，舞侶們便須載欣載奔，誰說上海人生活頹廢和不振作哩，君不見今日之下，她或他們巳在實行「聞鷄起舞」嗎？</p>
<h3>雪下人</h3>
<p>— 華京</p>
<p>前一陣孤島二次降雪，當夜馬路上凍死者　增。諺云：「江南三尺雪，人道十年豐」，現在可改為「上海一夜雪，街頭露屍增」！有許多人說：這許多凍死的人都是吃白麵，紅丸，自作自受，死有餘辜；但是其中孩屍竟佔半數以上，可見路斃者並非全係有毒癮者，請睡在溫暖的被窩做着好夢的人發發慈悲，想個辦法救救這些雪下可憐蟲！寒冷的氣候還有長時期的繼續，正不知尚有幾許雪下人在「候補」呢！</p>
<h3>王次龍在港逝世</h3>

<p>王次龍在銀壇上也是一位老將了。在大中華百合時代，「銀壇霸王」王元龍出足風頭的時候，次龍可以說是左右手，「美人計」「王氏四俠」都是不可炙手的作品。這十五六年間。多少影星況落了，而他們倆還是兀然不動。戰事以後，次龍是國聯公司的駐港導演，胡蝶的「蝴蝶夫人」本來是預備年底上映的，現在不但因為「八日」而停頓，而且也是永訣了！</p>

<h3>The Active Japanese Air Force: No Change in the Battle of Xin'dao (Singapore Island); British Forces Await Japanese Attack on Australia; Long Broadcast States Reinforcements are on the Way</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Domei News Agency) - Japanese planes and artillery continued to bombard Singapore today. Japanese aircraft also intensified their attacks on British positions in central Burma. As for the Japanese ground forces, it is reported that small units are crossing the Salween River westward.</p>
<p>Singapore, 3rd (Havas) - An official communique has been released stating that in the past twenty-four hours, Japanese aircraft have been extremely active over Singapore, repeatedly bombing military targets and causing several fires. However, casualties were very light.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Haitong News Agency) - According to war reports from Xinshan (Johor Bahru), the gasoline depot at Seletar Fortress in Singapore, which caught fire after being hit the previous morning, was still burning yesterday. The fire was very intense.</p>
<p>Singapore, 4th (Reuters) - Japanese aircraft continued to attack Singapore yesterday. British air defense forces actively resisted. British and American forces anxiously await a land attack. According to today's Far East British Command communique, there are no changes to report in the battle situation. British artillery shelled Japanese motorized transport units in Xinshan. Xin'dao (Singapore Island) was attacked several times by Japanese aircraft yesterday, suffering slight damage, but there was no Japanese aircraft activity over Xin'dao from last night until this morning.</p>
<p>Bangkok, 4th (Haitong News Agency) - Australian Army Minister Ford, in a broadcast from Canberra to Australian troops in Singapore yesterday, stated that Allied reinforcements are on the way and that Japanese actions can be stopped at any time.</p>
<p>London, 3rd (Havas) - The Daily Telegraph reported today that while the Japanese army is developing an offensive against Singapore, although we will soon be unable to use the island's airfield, it is not impossible for our planes to operate over Singapore. This is because there are other bases within the operating range of our fighter planes, presumably airfields in Sumatra or the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<p>London, 3rd (Reuters) - Military commentators say that there is little news from the Far East today. The Japanese are apparently concentrating their forces in an attempt to attack Singapore. The preparation period will take some time, so this battle will clearly not be easy. Japanese aircraft have begun to intensify attacks on Singapore Island. The British air force bases there are very exposed and are unlikely to be useful in defense. Japanese aircraft have also bombed Surabaya, the main Dutch naval base on Java Island. This shows the extent of Japanese air operations. There are unconfirmed reports that the Japanese army has broken through the upper reaches of the Salween River. It is possible that Japan may temporarily refrain from attacking Singapore and shift its offensive to Burma, aiming to conquer the Dutch East Indies through continuous attacks. Currently, Japan is in a completely dominant position in land, sea, and air.</p>
<p>The Situation on Singapore Island</p>
<p>Xinshan, 4th (Domei News Agency) - The scenery of Singapore is not very clear from here, but with binoculars, all movements are clearly visible, as if one were in Singapore. The British positions are also in sight. A vessel with three smokestacks, resembling a cruiser, was found aground on the beach. There are no people around the British naval headquarters. On the highway connecting the military port to Singapore city, military trucks are busy traveling, seemingly moving supplies to Singapore city. Part of the highway near the naval base is blocked to obscure the view, so it is impossible to see the vehicles traveling. No citizens are seen on the road, presumably having fled to the countryside. The area is full of fortresses, which are disguised, but upon closer inspection, the gunports of the fortresses can be seen pointing towards Xinshan. Near the military port, there are twenty-six heavy oil tanks that were bombed by Japanese aircraft. Five of them are still burning. The extent of the damage to the naval docks can also be seen through binoculars. There are only four anti-aircraft positions in the area, all on the right side of the Causeway. Behind the anti-aircraft guns is Seletar Airfield, but there are no fighters or bombers taking off. There are quite a few transport planes taking off, perhaps retreating towards the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 3rd (Havas) - The "United News" recently received a dispatch from its London correspondent stating that although Singapore is surrounded, life is as peaceful as usual. The purchase of fruits and vegetables has been restricted a few days ago. The authorities have also drafted a plan to plant various vegetables in all arable land. However, the issue of drinking water is still a concern for the authorities. It is understood that the authorities have taken all necessary measures to prevent a shortage of drinking water. Although the situation is extremely serious, theaters and cinemas are still operating as usual.</p>
<p>Wavell Encourages British Troops</p>
<p>Singapore, 4th (Reuters) - General Wavell, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Southwest Pacific, today sent a telegram to the British troops besieged in the fortress of Singapore Island, encouraging them. The telegram stated briefly, "We must buy time to wait for the reinforcements that Britain and the United States are currently sending to the Eastern battlefield. You must fight for every inch of land. Our allies, the Dutch, are determined to sacrifice and are implementing this policy throughout the Dutch East Indies. I hope you will no longer have the thought of retreat and that the defense of Singapore will be remembered like Tobruk."</p>
<p>Stockholm, 4th (Haitong News Agency) - According to news from London, British newspapers and the public are quite concerned about the fate of Rangoon, because if Rangoon is occupied and the Burma Road is sealed off, China will have no supply route. British newspapers believe that the situation in Singapore is also extremely serious and that only a large number of fighter planes can save Singapore. This squadron must be stationed in Sumatra, because Singapore's three airfields are within range of Japanese artillery.</p>
<h3>Gu Weijun's Speech in England on the Importance of Singapore</h3>
<p>London, 3rd (Havas) - Gu Weijun, the Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, recently delivered a speech at the Kilt Hall here, stating briefly that Singapore's position is important, so its safety not only determines who obtains endless resources, but also determines who gains a strategic advantage in the global war. If the Japanese army can occupy Singapore, the South Seas will be controlled by Japan. If that happens, it will greatly help the large-scale pincer strategy planned by the Axis powers. In other words, Germany and Japan will advance simultaneously at that time. The German army will attack eastward from the Caucasus, Iran, and Iraq, while the Japanese army will attack westward from its new positions in Malaya and the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<h3>Sydney East Coast Conducts Air Defense Exercises</h3>
<p>Melbourne, 3rd (Associated Press) - Australia has suspended postal flights with the British Empire.

Only two air raid alarms were issued. British aircraft provided cover for the army to attack Japanese positions.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Fiercely Attacks American Troops on Philippine Islands</p>
<p>Washington, 4th (Reuters) - The Department of the Army announced yesterday that in the Philippines, the Japanese army attempted to land on the west coast of the Batangas Peninsula on Luzon Island twice on Monday night last week, using a large number of barges, escorted by warships. However, before reaching the shore, they were discovered by several of our night fighter planes. When the Japanese army approached the coast, the coastal defense forces immediately used artillery and machine guns to counterattack. The Japanese offensive against our left flank has been weakened, and our army has launched a counterattack against them. Japanese aircraft activity has also slowed down in the last twenty-four hours. In addition, our army officer, Lieutenant General Pierce, sustained minor injuries during the battle.</p>
<p>Australian Passenger Plane Shot Down</p>
<p>Melbourne, 4th (Havas) - Local officials have announced that the giant seaplane "Corinthian," flying from Darwin Port on January 30th, was shot down by Japanese aircraft over Kupang, the capital of Timor Island.

Fierce fighting is still taking place on Ambon. The battle is continuing near Balikpapan on the east coast of Dutch Borneo. According to a communique issued by the Dutch East Indies Military Headquarters this afternoon, a total of seventy or eighty Japanese bombers, escorted by fighter planes, bombed several cities and airfields in Java yesterday. The main targets of the attack were Surabaya, Malang, and Madiun. Dutch East Indies fighter planes took off to intercept them at each location. Japanese planes in Surabaya ×××××××× Dutch side suffered heavy damage, but details are not yet known. Dutch warships were also attacked by air in several locations.</p>
<p>Washington, 2nd - A communique from the U.S. Department of the Army stated that U.S. Flying Fortresses bombed Kuala Lumpur and Kota Bharu in the Malay Peninsula. The results of the bombing are unknown due to poor weather. All aircraft returned safely to their base.

<h3>Landslide in Bulgaria</h3>
<p>Sofia, Bulgaria, 3rd (Havas) - A landslide occurred on the Stara Zagora highway today. Fifty ski cars were passing by at the time, resulting in a tragedy. Four people died. Due to heavy snow and the rampant wolf packs nearby, rescue efforts are extremely difficult.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting on the Eastern Front; Soviet Defense Committee Appoints Deputy Commander of the Air Force</h3>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Havas) - Officials announced this morning that fighting on the Eastern Front was very intense yesterday.</p>
<p>London, 3rd (Associated Press) - On the German-Soviet battlefield, although German resistance is gradually strengthening, Soviet forces continue to attack fiercely in the Leningrad, Moscow, and Kharkov battlefields. In addition, Soviet forces have intensified their offensive in the Sevsk area northwest of Moscow, and its threat has extended to the entire position of the German army on the battlefield west of Moscow. In the Kharkov area, Soviet ski troops continue to attack the German front line east of the city and continue to advance westward south of the city.</p>
<p>Moscow, 4th - The Soviet Defense Committee has decided to appoint Air Force Lieutenant General Novikov as the First Deputy Commander of the Air Force and Air Force Lieutenant General Petrov as the Second Deputy Commander.</p>
<p>Ankara, 4th (Haitong News Agency) - Moscow dispatches state that the Soviet Defense Council has added two new members: Foreign Trade Commissar Lyubimov and Vyshinsky, who once held an important position.</p>
<h3>Hanoi Issues Air Raid Alert Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Soviets Train New Army in the Urals; Factories Evacuated to Central Asia</h3>
<p>Moscow, 4th - Soviet factories that have been evacuated are now resuming operations in Central Asia. At the same time, a new army is being actively trained in Siberia and the Urals.

<h3>Unified Command of Allied Forces in the Pacific; Naval Commander-in-Chief May be Appointed First</h3>
<p>Washington, 3rd (Havas) - Officials from the Army and Navy here said that the new developments in the Pacific War and the "repeated opening of new battlefields in the Pacific in recent days" have made it necessary to unify the command of the Allied naval, land, and air forces now fighting in the Pacific. Regarding this matter, British and American military officials are reportedly considering it. As a result of repeated requests from the Dominion of New Zealand and the Commonwealth of Australia, the first step will likely be to appoint a Naval Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in the Pacific, so that naval command can be unified first. Admiral Helfrich is currently only the Naval Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific, and Admiral Nimitz is the Commander of the Hawaiian Fortress. Since the Pacific War is now a large-scale naval war, it is appropriate to have unified command.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 4th (Haitong News Agency) - Yesterday, information received from Washington stated that the location of the Supreme Military Council of the Allied Forces in the Pacific will reportedly be in Washington. British Prime Minister Churchill originally wanted to establish it in London, but it did not come to fruition due to the opposition of New Zealand, the Dutch East Indies, and Chongqing.</p>
<p>Dutch East Indies Deputy Governor Urges Coordination of Needs</p>
<p>Washington - Dutch East Indies Deputy Governor Van Mook, in a speech to the National Press Association, stated that there is an urgent need for Allied nations to coordinate their operational strategies and objectives in the Pacific. He also stated that we need a unified command and objective. If the Japanese army breaks through the defensive line between Asia and Australia, the Japanese army can attack the rear of the Middle East front. To avoid this, the troops and supplies needed in the Pacific must be shipped as quickly as possible. The Dutch East Indies needs airplanes, anti-aircraft guns, submarines, and other small boats. The U.S. government is now fully aware of the seriousness of the situation. Van Mook also commented on the importance of battleships. He believes that battleships are not important in the current war because the sea area of the current operation is small and combat is hindered. Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens spoke at the same location, saying that the United Kingdom is also well aware of the seriousness of the situation and feels the problem on the path to assistance.</p>
<p>Canberra, 3rd (Havas) - The Australian Commonwealth Foreign Minister stated that the government has decided to strictly supervise the activities of foreign immigrants in northern Queensland, and even implement clearing villages is possible. The authorities have recently received reports that only 20% of Italian immigrants in northern Queensland have complied with the law and surrendered their new firearms to the police. Nine out of ten Italian immigrants harbor ulterior motives towards the Commonwealth government. Although military and police authorities are implementing measures, residents of Rambuton Shire have scheduled a public meeting today to discuss the rapid organization of "militias" to prepare for invasion and monitor Italian immigrants within the territory.</p>
<p>Sydney, 3rd (Havas) - Australian Commonwealth mining experts recently held a meeting here and immediately decided that if the crisis of Japanese invasion of Australia becomes increasingly imminent, all Australian resources must be destroyed.</p>
<h3>Order Restored in Huixian County</h3>

<h3>Measures for the Distribution of Funds for the Relief of Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Chongqing, today's dispatch - After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the central government has been very concerned about the lives of overseas Chinese and their families and students in the mainland.

At his advanced age, he demonstrated righteousness. It was hoped that his spirit would last forever. Sadly, fate is impermanent, and in a moment, he has departed from this world. In retrospect, my grief is immense. I hope you will accept the change and restrain your grief, and carry on his noble aspirations. I respectfully send this telegram of condolence and offer my regards. Ye Chucang."</p>

<h3>Egyptian King Advocates Organizing a Coalition Cabinet; Consultations with Leaders of Various Parties Concluded; Stone Appointed Commander of British Forces in Egypt</h3>
<p>Cairo, 4th (Havas) - King Farouk concluded consultations with leaders of various parties regarding the organization of a new cabinet today. It is reported that Farouk advocates recruiting figures from various parties to organize a coalition cabinet.</p>
<p>Cairo, 3rd (Havas) - After the Hussein cabinet resigned, King Farouk appointed Ali Maher Pasha to form a new cabinet. Maher accepted the appointment and immediately began contacting various parties.</p>
<p>Cairo, 3rd (Havas) - King Farouk met with British Ambassador Lampson today for discussions. The content of the talks was related to the current cabinet crisis in Egypt. According to informed sources here, the Egyptian cabinet's resignation was not only due to the issue of severing relations with France, but also due to the national food crisis, which was a major reason. During the most recent meeting of the House of Representatives, various parties strongly criticized the government's improper handling of agricultural affairs. Some members were shocked that Egypt, such a fertile country, was suffering from famine. The wheat stored last year will be completely consumed by the end of this month, and the new wheat will not be harvested until April of this year. With the situation so critical, the government was at a loss, so they asked Prime Minister Hussein to find a way to import a large amount of wheat from the United Kingdom, otherwise he should resign.</p>
<p>London, 3rd (Havas) - Reuters Cairo dispatch states that the Egyptian cabinet's announcement of its resignation was actually due to the Prime Minister's decision to sever relations with France. When the cabinet decided to sever relations with France, King Farouk was not in the capital. When the King returned to the capital, he asked the Foreign Minister to resign. Prime Minister Hussein expressed his agreement with the Foreign Minister's views and also submitted his resignation, which was accepted by the King. British political figures deeply regretted that Hussein, who had always faithfully fulfilled the entire Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, had resigned.</p>

<p>Since the member banks and firms of the Silver and Money Trade Association have complied with the temporary measures for the operation of banks and money firms promulgated by the Federation, the entire financial situation has stabilized and credit has become more readily available. Now, to adjust finance and support the development of various industries, payment of funds to companies, factories, and firms is being handled with special flexibility. Although it is stipulated that current deposits before December 8th should be paid out at a rate of 500 yuan every three days per account, if there is a genuine and proper use, each account can negotiate directly with the banks and firms without restriction. Checks issued by each account are allowed to be cashed flexibly. Bank and firm withdrawal slips are now fully accepted in the market, which is deeply trusted by all coupon holders. Furthermore, withdrawal slips are paid out as much as possible for payments to various industries. It is rumored that once the final account period for each industry has passed, the previous temporary operating measures will be abolished. The operating hours of each bank and firm are temporarily from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM, according to the new Municipal Council time.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Selling Flour at 50 Yuan per Bag</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council recently issued a notice stating that, starting from the 5th of this month, all kinds of flour purchased by the Council and the French Concession Municipal Council will be sold at a wholesale price of 50 yuan (national currency) per bag (49 pounds).

<h3>Population Census Proceeding Smoothly with the Assistance of Postal Workers</h3>
<p>The English-language "North China Daily News" reports that the population census conducted by the Concession authorities is still proceeding smoothly this morning (the 4th). Approximately 300,000 census forms have already been issued in the International Settlement, and the same number of forms will be issued again from tomorrow (the 5th) until Friday. The Western District is relatively small, and only about 1,000 forms have been distributed to foreign residents in the district, and the progress is quite satisfactory. The census in this district is expected to be completed before February 20th. The population census in the two Concessions is expected to be completed around February 10th.</p>
<p>Regarding the census in the French Concession, in addition to deploying police officers, postal workers from the Masnan Road Post Office have been borrowed to assist. It is understood that these postal workers assisting the French police in the census are not all from the Masnan Road Post Office. Due to restrictions on automobile traffic and the shortage of gasoline in the two Concessions, the five vehicles used by the Postal Administration's main and branch offices to transport packages have also been unable to operate. As a result, the Postal Administration drew seventy messengers and postal workers from various offices to transport these packages by bicycle. Now, the French Municipal Council has requested the Postal Administration to borrow postal workers to assist in the census within the French Concession. The Postal Administration has assigned these workers who transport packages to carry out this task, and the French Municipal Council will provide 15 gallons of gasoline daily to allow the five vehicles transporting packages to continue operating without affecting postal services. These postal workers have been carrying out the census work within the French Concession since the 1st of this month, and the French Municipal Council also sends gasoline to the main office every day for the vehicles transporting packages to operate.</p>
<h3>Urge Registration of Industrial Raw Materials</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council issued a notice stating that all factories and workshops located in the International Settlement that employ 30 or more workers and intend to operate this year should register the quantity of raw materials they need each month with the Council. Application forms can be obtained from the Council's Volunteer Corps parade ground. Once completed, they should be submitted by the responsible person to the Council's office number 803 for verification. All items required in the form should be filled in accurately, as the future supply of raw materials to each factory may depend on the accuracy of the quantity reported. As of now, more than 600 registration forms have been collected, but many have not yet been collected. Please collect and fill in the forms as soon as possible. Do not delay any further. The registration should be completed by 4:00 PM on the 11th of this month. As for factories run by Japanese merchants and those currently controlled by the Japanese authorities, they do not need to register.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council Handles Registration of Charcoal</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council recently issued a notice stating that anyone holding more than 150 kilograms (or 300 catties) of charcoal in stock should report to the Council for registration before the 8th of this month. However, charcoal owned by Japanese residents that has already been registered with the Japanese authorities does not need to be registered with the Council again. When registering the stock, the weight of each type of charcoal should be indicated in kilograms, and the types should be determined according to their place of origin (such as Huzhou, Changxing, Jiaxing, Xiashi, Ninghai, Hangzhou). The total number of baskets of stock, as well as the weight of each basket, together with the location of the stock, should be clearly indicated. Registration forms can be obtained from the Council's office number 333. Once completed, they should be sent to that office for verification as soon as possible. Stocks that are not registered with the Council in accordance with this notice will be confiscated without further compensation.</p>

<h3>Only Over 900 Cars Running in the Two Concessions; Authorities Will Re-select When Renewing Permits Next Month</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen restrictions on automobiles, the authorities in the two Concessions have reduced the number of running cars to slightly over 1,000 and have issued permits, which car owners should affix to the windows for identification. The first phase of permits stopped being issued on the 23rd of last month, and their validity was also stipulated to end on the 31st of last month. The second phase of new permits began to be issued on February 1st, and the number of vehicles approved to run has decreased even more compared to last month. A total of 854 vehicles were approved to run in the International Settlement last month. This time, it has been reduced by another 300 vehicles, leaving only 554 vehicles. In the French Concession, only slightly over 400 vehicles have been approved to run this month, a decrease of about 100 vehicles compared to the 500 or so vehicles last month. Therefore, there are currently only over 900 cars in the two Concessions with running permits. The validity period of this second phase of permits is roughly one month as well. Next month, new permits will be renewed, and there will be another strict selection by the Concession authorities.</p>
<h3>Robbed on the Way Back from Gambling</h3>

When A left the gambling den laden with money, the thief followed him. When they reached a quiet spot on Henan Road, the thief took out a tin fake pistol, pointed it at A's face, and demanded money. A was forced to hand over the money, but he was unwilling. When the thief was fleeing, a police officer happened to be passing by, so he was arrested by the police. However, A was also detained in the police station, accused of gambling.</p>

<h3>Citrus Fruits (II)</h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>What is strange is that the Jin Dynasty scholar Ji Han, in his work "Descriptions of Plants and Trees of the South," sometimes describes the shapes of other plants in great detail. Yet, regarding the shape of the "tangerine," he uses only eleven characters: "Tangerines have white flowers, red fruit, fragrant peel, and a delicious taste." Regarding the "mandarin orange," he only says, "The mandarin orange belongs to the tangerine family. It has a particularly sweet and delicious flavor. Some are yellow, some are reddish, and those that are broad are called 'pot mandarin oranges.'" Perhaps he thought that mandarin oranges were native to our country and familiar to everyone, so there was no need to waste ink on depicting them? We now know that mandarin oranges belong to the genus Citrus of the Rutaceae family because they propagate so easily.</p>

<h3>Eating New Year's Eve Dinner and Abstaining from Killing</h3>
<p>— Liao Mu</p>
<p>"The chilling wind and bitter rain sadden people." Experiencing this scene at the end of the lunar year truly gives one the feeling that the Buddha described as "unspeakable." Yet, time refuses to wait for people and has finally drifted by gently and quietly arrived once more. Yesterday was "Beginning of Spring," and we will soon welcome the "Spring Festival."</p>
<p>In ordinary times, after a year of hard work, taking a short break to decorate, offering thanks at year's end, and the whole family reuniting to happily eat New Year's Eve dinner is one of life's pleasures. A few cups of unfiltered wine, a few dishes of sliced raw fish and meat, in terms of human feelings, no one would dare say it is too wasteful, and it has its own significance for the holiday. Even if one displays some extravagance, killing some chickens and ducks, and boiling some fish and meat, relying on the blessings of the spirits and ancestors, it seems to be a right that those who are bustling and lively should have.</p>
<p>However, in this day and age, with the holiday at hand, if one wants to share more of the soup and cannot avoid following tradition, I think a group of those who buy rice at fixed prices would truly frown and only give a bitter smile. This is somewhat distant from some serious Buddhists and revolutionaries, but "the pheasant on the mountain ridge, now is the time, now is the time," that was then, and this is now.</p>
<p>Some people still like to stubbornly adhere to tradition, eating their New Year's Eve dinner with gusto, unwilling to engage in conservation. But how will tomorrow be after this good night? Therefore, those who are not too optimistic should plan for how to support life after the good night and holiday. Matters of ghosts and spirits are distant and vague; the pleasure of the palate is only for the present. This evokes a special emotion.</p>
<p>The Chinese Moral Improvement Society is advocating abstaining from killing to save lives, saving creatures to save people. Although some may think it is a commonplace, upon reflection, it does have meaning today. "It is better for the neighbor to the west to offer a simple sacrifice of vegetables than for the neighbor to the east to slaughter an ox." A simple sacrifice is to offer boiled vegetables. Being cautious to the end and remembering those who are far away, one must not forget the fundamentals, and one must also hold the concept of "compassion for heaven and pity for mankind, being saddened by the suffering of one's kind." Finding joy in hardship is somewhat embarrassing; saving on waste can still do something beneficial for others.</p>
<p>Qing Dynasty scholar Peng Jiqing wrote a poem on New Year's Eve: "The neighbor's chickens crow all night, vying to be the first to announce dawn; here I pass the fifth watch in desolation; blood stains a thousand knives, flowing endlessly, while accompanying wine and talk of spring's arrival." I also have a feeling of desolation, alas!</p>
<h3>Stage and Screen</h3>
<p>"The Hunter's Story," co-starring Walter Pidgeon and Joan Bennett, is a sensational thriller that Shanghai film fans have been eagerly awaiting. It is now known that the film is in Hong Kong and will come to Shanghai as soon as the situation stabilizes.</p>

This spring, she accepted an invitation from Dianlei Hua and co-starred in a film with Walter Huston called "All That Money Can Buy." It is said that this film was shipped to Shanghai before the outbreak of the Pacific War and will soon be released to the public.</p>
<p>— Duo Bao</p>

<p>As he spoke, he slowly pulled a photograph from under his pillow.</p>
<p>"To...you...," he fixed his lifeless eyes on this photograph that had never left him for more than a decade, and said haltingly, "I...I also...fee...feel very...very sorry....

Now...now it's...too late...to regret...."</p>
<p>Seeing that he was having difficulty speaking, Mei Bao quickly poured half a glass of boiled water, mixed it with the asthma medication left by the doctor, held back her tears, walked over to feed it to him, and at the same time took the photograph he was holding in his hand.</p>
<p>"Dad, rest, rest! Tomorrow we will definitely go and hire a better doctor, no matter what, we must cure your illness." Mei Bao said very childishly. (325)</p>
<h3>"Awakening and Dancing to the Rooster's Crow"</h3>
<p>— Wang Qiushui</p>
<p>Reportedly: "Various entertainment venues have suffered heavy losses due to early closing hours and have jointly petitioned the authorities, requesting that the business hours be appropriately extended under the principle of electricity conservation."</p>
<p>Reportedly: "The authorities reiterated the previous order, strictly limiting the closing time of entertainment venues to before 10 p.m. every night."</p>
<p>Reportedly: "A new invention, the breakfast dance, starts at 9 a.m. every day."</p>
<p>We cannot help but admire the Shanghai dance hall operators. In order to plan for their own business and to seek happiness for the public (entertainment is a necessity for everyone to relieve fatigue, which can be called "public happiness," presumably this is not excessive praise), they do not hesitate to run into such a big snag. However, with a little brainstorming, they followed the luncheon dance, tea dance, and evening dance with the breakfast dance. Dancing is available anytime, anywhere, thus increasing business income and providing convenience for the public.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "A big belly is good for business." The businessman who invented the breakfast dance should be considered "good" at adapting to the times. From the perspectives of business acumen and adapting to the current environment, the breakfast dance has its own value. Since the night market has disappeared, people's sleep will inevitably increase. Sleep is like eating; overeating is harmful to the stomach, and excessive sleep can also cause the brain to become muddled. In this way, after getting up early, one can go to the dance hall to dance for an hour or two to "wake up the brain" and have breakfast at the same time, achieving both goals and ensuring a day of vigor. It is said that dancing has the meaning of combining exercise with entertainment. It is hoped that the ladies of Shanghai will go dancing, because dancing can lead to getting up early, and getting up early can strengthen the body. The "breakfast dance" is only a "token gesture" in the dance program, but it provides great help.</p>
<p>After the implementation of the new time, 9 o'clock is 8 o'clock. From now on, in the faint morning light, dance partners must run eagerly. Who says that Shanghai people's lives are decadent and uninspired? Do you not see that today, she or they have already started practicing "awakening and dancing to the rooster's crow"?</p>
<h3>People Under the Snow</h3>
<p>— Hua Jing</p>
<p>During the last two snowfalls on the isolated island, the number of people who froze to death on the streets that night increased sharply. There is a saying: "Three feet of snow in Jiangnan means ten years of abundance." Now it can be changed to "One night of snow in Shanghai, the number of corpses on the streets increases!" Many people say: These many people who froze to death are all addicted to white powder and red pills, they brought it on themselves and deserve to die. However, child corpses account for more than half of them, indicating that those who died on the road were not all drug addicts. Please, those who are sleeping in warm beds and dreaming good dreams, have mercy and think of a way to save these pitiful worms under the snow! The cold weather will continue for a long time, and who knows how many people under the snow are still "waiting in line"!</p>
<h3>Wang Cilong Passed Away in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>— Tai Xu</p>
<p>Today, I must report another unfortunate news to the readers: Wang Laowu Wang Cilong has passed away in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Wang Cilong was also a veteran on the silver screen. In the era of Da Zhonghua Baihe, when "Silver Screen Overlord" Wang Yuanlong was in the limelight, Cilong could be said to be his right-hand man. "Beauty Trap" and "Four Heroes of the Wang Family" were all highly sought-after works. In these fifteen or sixteen years, many movie stars have declined, but the two of them remained unmoved. After the war, Cilong was the resident director of the Guolian Film Company. Hu Die's "Madame Butterfly" was originally scheduled to be released at the end of the year, but now it has not only been suspended due to "August 8th," but it is also a permanent farewell!</p>
<p>This unfortunate news was sent by Wang Yuanlong in a letter from Hong Kong yesterday. News of other film people staying in Hong Kong was not mentioned.</p>
