<h3>對青年運動　貢獻幾點意見　林宣傳部長廣播詞</h3>
<p>各位同胞、各位靑年、這一次奉命赴日、除出席興亞懇談會外、主要的任務是考察友邦靑少年的組織和訓練、自九月底出國十月底取道京城北京、返抵首都、歷時一月、在日本各地考察的時間、共計三個星期、關於友邦男女靑少年·學校靑少年·職業靑少年·工廠靑少年·農村靑少年、以及海陸空軍靑少年之組織訓練實况、在精神上、技術上所見所聞、可資借鏡的、實在太多了、現在正與同行諸人、整理資料、打算在最近寫成考察報吿書、以貢獻於政府、及全國靑年、今天先就此次考察友邦靑少年組織訓練、在精神上最足注意的提出幾點、來向各位作一簡單的報吿、</p>
<p>第一點、友邦靑少年團指導者的努力、完全是爲國家訓練靑年培養力量、絕對不是爲私人樹植勢力的、大家只知爲國家、爲東亞、把個人的一切貢獻出來、友邦國勢蒸蒸日上、致有今日、絕不是偶然的、我們中國之有靑年運動、不自今日始、靑年運動對於國民革命佔有很重要的地位、革命以來、靑年同志的努力和犧牲精神、實足敬佩、可是廿餘年來、靑年運動之發展、有一個最大的缺點、是我們所首應深切反省加以糾正的、不少從事靑年運動的人總是拿靑年運動來做私人的工具、把靑年放在私人的夾心袋裏、利用靑年愛國的精神、利用靑年參加革命的熱情、造成私人的地位、等到目的已達、便把靑年丢棄、甚或加以蹂躪、二十多年來、歷次政治運動小組織林立、政治局勢擾攘不安、以致於靑年們始而一片精誠、繼而意見紛歧、終至消沉徬徨、可以說都是由此而生的、我們今日處在生死存亡、間不容髮的嚴重局面下、再不容許利用靑年來樹植私人勢力、我們應該盡心盡力、精誠團結、訓練靑年、培養力量、以之獻給領袖、獻給黨、獻給國、獻給東亞、友邦靑少年團指導者、那種爲國家爲東亞貢獻力量的精神、正値得我們拿來做榜樣、新國民運動要在組織訓練中消滅個人主義、就必須從指導者本人做起、兄弟個人首先應該反省、並以此與全國靑年指導者共相策勉第二點、友邦國民男女老幼、都有一種認眞而嚴肅的精誠、他們無論做什麽事、絕對沒有馬虎塞責的、有一天、正是發表美國空襲陰謀的時候、我們淸晨外出參觀、沿途看見都是防空演習的人員、不分男女、穿起防空的衣帽、一處一處、一隊一隊站崗的站崗、演習的演習、直到深夜還是一樣、差不多整個東京動員起來、從事防空演習、速飯館娛樂塲所裏也是一樣、他們一點不苟且、都是認眞而嚴肅的、過幾天參觀大學女學生、並防空演習、那天剛是下着大雨、學校當局、徵求學生的意見、他們說下雨也會空襲、自然也要演習、結果照預定計劃切切實實的去做、那種逼眞的情形、一隊一隊的救火隊、防毒隊、救傷隊、在滂沱大雨下、就像在槍林彈雨中作戰一樣、她們一點不苟且、都非常認眞、非常跋肅、友邦國民此種精神、隨時隨處可以看見現在不過舉一個例而巳、回想五六年來、無論在實際的空襲或在假想的演習中、只有極少數不能不負責者在那裏、勉力從事、大多數人不是袖手旁觀、便是倉皇逃避、唉、我們生在這裏、死也在這裏、逃到那裏去、自己不嚴肅的負責靠　　誰來負責、這一點又是我所應該反省引以爲榜樣的、</p>
<p>第三點、友邦靑少年的組織訓練、爲爭取戰爭的勝利與戰後建設、以國防訓練爲經、以勤勞奉仕爲緯、而對各地方的情形、各個人的工作崗位、工作能力、都能够周密的顧慮到、對於學校靑年、不是叫他們荒廢學業、只知貼標語、喊口號、而是於組織訓練之中、補助敎育的效率、發揮靑年的本能、鍛鍊學生的身心、使之更能向上、更能爲國家、爲社會效力、對於工廠靑年、不是叫他們擅離職守、只知開會叫囂、鈎心鬥角、去增加勞資糾紛、而是於組織訓練之中、給予精神的敎育技術的鍛鍊、使之更能勞資調協、更能增加生產、亦即更能爲國家增進力量、對於農村靑年、也是一樣、那一個地方要開墾的、那一條河道要開濬的、依照實際需要去動員、靑年參加勞動、還有農忙的時候、都市的小姐、一隊一隊的到鄉村去替農民照料兒童、燒火煮飯、每一件事、都有實際的需要、得到實際的效果、對靑年有益對鄉土有益、對國家有益、絕不是我們那樣叫靑年學生掃掃街、種種樹、只是拿來做宣傳的、</p>
<p>以上所說、不過就觀感所及、對於友邦靑年運動優良的精神、而正是我們中國所急需的兩三點、特別提出來、向全國同胞報告、至於組織上、訓練上、各種具體的問題、因爲彼此國體國情不盡相同，我們拿看同中見異、異中見同、取人之長、補已之短、兩個原則去悉心考察、覺得可供參證的地方、絕不是簡單幾句話所可槪括、只好留待書面的報吿了、</p>
<p>最後還有一點要鄭重報吿的、我們於這一次考察中、在戰時體制下、看見友邦社會組織更嚴密、經濟力量的本質更堅靸、國民精神更煥發、我知道大東亞戰爭、不只有必勝的信念、並且有必勝的信念、其尤足爲我們所敬佩的、便是全國上下男女老幼一種最高度最純潔的愛國心、我們從這裏更體認出友邦靑年對於中國的熱情與誠意、惟其有此最高度的愛國心、所以能够把一切獻給國家、所以遇事能够認眞而嚴肅、所以能够刻苦耐勞勇猛精進、唯其有此純潔的愛國心、所以能够擴展其愛國心、而愛東亞、所以能够推己之所愛、而及人之所愛、我們兩國、幾十年來、雖然有過創鉅痛深的變故、然而兩國靑年的深心裏、始终有着一種最純潔的心靈的交響、這完全是由於最純潔的愛國家愛東亞的心情所發生出來的、短短三星期間、無論在什麼塲合、友邦青少年對於我們的熱烈與誠意、實在使我們太感動了、這種熱情與誠意、不是對兄弟個人、而是對中國、對中國靑年、對愛中國、愛日本愛東亞的中國靑年的、我們確信由於兩國靑年心靈的交響、必能使兩國靑年團結起來、建立成爲一隊一隊的保衛東亞的鐵軍、可以斷言、靑年們、友邦靑年已大步的在保衛東亞的大道上走在前頭了、我們要怎樣努力邁進、這是我們所應該深自鞭策的、兄弟今日更無別的說話、願隨全國靑年之後更加强其促進新國民運動的決心、和努力、謹以滿腔熱誠、祝中國靑年團結起來、創造靑年的中國、並祝東亞靑年團結起來、創造靑年的東亞、</p>

<h3>食油批發處通吿　掃數出售存油　運油移動證正設法請准</h3>
<p>油商數百家因抬價停止配給</p>
<p>最近市內食油、因有一部份商人囤積、以致發生不安之狀、同業批發處特聲明（一）目前市內存油數量尙甚充足、在相當期內、定無缺乏之虞、（二）目前上海製油工廠生產量、日約千擔、供給上海一日需要、有過無不及、即使今後因原料不能源源運來、油廠開工率减低、而現存之油亦可抵補、（三）浦東滬西已有工廠數家、除供給當地需要外、尙有一部份可運入市內、故市內食油供求狀况、今後當可緩和、至於食油黑市、係牟利之徒所造成、該處已嚴密澈查、澈底取締、其另售店高抬價格、已經查明確實、停止配給者有二三百家、所以現所配給食油之店爲一千八百餘家、</p>
<p>通吿</p>
<p>上海食油同業批發處昨發通吿各食油零售商店云、上略、查上海地區所需食油、其供給機關、爲軍配組合、至於本處、不過職司分配而已、當成立之時、呈請</p>
<p>按月需要食油數量、定爲四萬擔、至少爲三萬擔無如過去九閱月中、每月供給數量僅有二萬擔左右、除酒菜等業另行配給外、可分配於各會昌者祇有一萬七千擔之譜、如以二千家會員</p>
<p>平均分派每月每家、所得爲八擔五十斤、此數不足應銷、自在意中、而按之配給物資原則、猶不能以會員家數爲單位、必須根據過去歷史營業情形、並依</p>
<p>申請登記數量、以定分配之多寡、則範圍較小之會員另售店、配給數量當然更少、故就會員之家數與過去食油之供量而言、是以本處對於會員請求增加油量、或申請加入配油、此爲本處</p>
<p>深感困難未能照辦之眞正原因、現屆冬令、油銷較旺、本批發處深悉情形、一再請求當局增加數量、奈以種種關係、不獲如願、近日運油移動證、以主管機關交替中、不能請領、</p>
<p>現正請求當局設法善後、以資維持、一俟核准、再行通吿、至貴會員存油、應即從速掃數出售、以應市民需要、幸勿居奇、以免當局查明致受處分、特此奉聞、即希查照爲荷、</p>

<p>存糖可維持一年餘</p>
<p>現有存糖頗足、非特足供本年之用、且可維持至來歲以後、尤有進者、食糖來源已通、自無匱乏之可能、故居民母須自相驚擾、切勿忙於添購食糖、據該處查悉、向零售店爭購食糖之羣衆中、有半數均以高價轉售爲目的、因此規定須憑市民證、始得購糖、旨在防止非法貿利之徒、高價轉售或運往他區、關於恢復此間食糖供應之常態事、該處已研究確保公允分配之辦法、而擬具計劃、將呈交當局作最後之考量與核准、該員末稱、上海食糖供應、絕無短少之問題、目下存在之不幸狀况、皆係無稽謠諑所造成、糖商合作營業處刻正竭其所能、以謀補救、俾使情况復入正軌云、</p>

<h3>蒐羅豐富的　六大圖書館巡禮（四）</h3>
<p>借書出館的時間，各圖書館都限於星期日子，禮拜天槪下借出。新亞開放的時間是上午九時半至十二時，下午一時至四時，暑天則中午不停，延至二時即行閉館。震旦借書的時間為上午八時半開始下午三時開始，各維持二小時。工部局則開放即可借出。</p>
<p>新亞因爲借書的人多，不易借到，每次要開許多書，才可借到一二本。流行的書如巴金小說以及郵政考試期間的郵政書，和現在的保險業書等，都是極不易借到的。往往開了許多仍借不到一本的。別處借書都要每書寫一張紙，館內即以此紙爲憑。工部局圖書館的書可以自到書庫挑選，如果不會挑選的，可索取卡片，在目錄上查明號碼作者，寫在上面，背面寫自己地址姓名投入卡片箱內，若書在的，兩三天後，便會寄到；再去領取。新亞也有這種手續，但限於預定不易借到的書。</p>
<p>一張借書證能借的書普通爲兩本。新亞則限一本。工部局有三本，但學生只借兩本。借出的書，如新亞只一星期，工部局明復都一星期，震旦則至一月，期滿必須交還，否則要罰金，新亞每日為五分，他處一角。如果要續看，可帶書到館展期（Renew），展期的期限和借出期限相同。新亞有些厚的書，自動展期一至三星期的，但這許多時間內仍看不完，展期的時間仍只一星期。</p>
<p>借出的書籍自然要珍惜。常有許多讀者喜歡在書上批評，謾駡，或發牢騷，實在太無意義了。有的人看見好的便要撕去，而且只要有利可圖，甚至要把圖書館的東西，昧歸己有。新亞圖書館中所藏那些商務中華等大書局以外的書，往往不漲定價，而且這些書大都已經絕版，很爲珍貴，所以寄語該館，應加注意才好。據作者的意見，書的價値是在其靈魂，不在其軀殼，你把書中的要旨了解明白，書的軀殼對於你便無用處了。反之，那些斤斤計較於書的軀殼的人，一定是不肯讀書的人，書的軀殼雖然到你手裏，書的靈魂却仍舊沒有屬於你。</p>
<p>餘論</p>
<p>現在的出版界非常寂寞沉悶，使讀書的人減卻不小的勇氣。其中最普通的是兩種觀念。有派守舊人以爲米價貴了，飯也吃不起了，得過且過也沒有辦法了，還買什麼書？另外有一派很新的人以爲新的雜誌沒有了，還讀什麽書？</p>
<p>關於第一個問題，我覺得買書固好，借書也未嘗不可。書的價値是書底靈魂的價値，並不是書底軀殼的價値。所以只要讀得越認眞，軀殼的價値失得越快；讀得越多，軀殼的價値失得越多。以這點而論，借書反比買書合算。如果喜歡到外面看書，而貪安逸，那麼借到家裏，也未始不可。圖書館裏普通的書都可借出，專鬥一些的書，則在圖書館裏閱讀，有時反比在家裏的專心一志，可以收到更大的效果。</p>
<p>關於第二個問題，我想沒有一個人能把舊的完全讀過，那末新的固很需要，舊的也不能缺乏。一切新的思想，學術，不能憑空突發；都由較舊的思想，較舊的學術中演變出來；脫胎出來。我們自現在追溯上去，一定可以發現其來龍去脈。這對於讀書的效果上，一定很有幫助。而且新的一切旣以舊的爲基礎，那末，對舊的多所了解，即對新的多能吸收。所以閱讀較舊的書，並不一定無用，這不但是無新書時權宜之計，而且也是有新書時應有的努力。（完）</p>

<p>小談</p>
<h3>犧牲精神</h3>
<p>— 高佳基</p>
<p>那天晚上已經十點多鐘了，突然聽見外面警笛大鳴。跑到窗口去探個究竟，看見路人紛紛朝北面跑。接着舉目一望，對面屋後濃烟密佈，火光燭天，烈燄直向上湧，火星滿天亂飛。原來是前面那些矮屋失火了。</p>
<p>一會兒救火車在奔駛來了，救火員開始忙碌地工作着，形勢突然緊張起來。因爲前面人頭擁擠，而且巡捕大隊出動維持秩序，不能挨近受災區域，祇能遠遠地隔道觀火。</p>
<p>六七歲的小孩，抱着剛睡暖的被，從災區逃跑出來，母親抱着孩子，有的乘黃包車，載運行李，情形惶急而悽慘。這樣一直鬧到深夜以後，才算把火救熄。可是已經有幾千人無家可歸，祇好幕天席地過夜了。</p>
<p>第二天一早就到災區去看，燒成平地的約有五六百家，有一兩間小工廠也在被焚之列。棟樑燒成了木炭，磚瓦焦黑了；殘餘的輪盤，機件，水筒，和鍋爐，散滿遍地。災民扶老携幼在灰燼中挖掘，在絕望中希冀保存一點失物。</p>
<p>在災區中，我突然發現了一列拆去一半的房子。樓上樓下的內容，一目瞭然。這列房屋以南，完全燒成平地，這列房子以北，則完好無缺。無疑地，這是救火員昨晚救火時所做的一部份工作。這列房屋是爲保全其他的房屋而犧牲了。</p>
<p>有許多時候，我們也應該有這種斷然拆屋的犧牲精神。爲了保全我們所愛的人，和他們的身家性命財產，以免同歸於盡，我們有時候應該犧牲金錢，犧牲職業，犧牲地位，犧牲豐厚的收入，犧牲物質的享受，甚至犧牲自己的性命</p>
<p>這樣佛家所謂「捨」的犧牲精神，是偉大的。</p>
<p>話匣</p>
<h3>貨物的媒介人</h3>
<p>— 開之</p>
<p>（三）辛苦銅鈿快樂用</p>
<p>掮客與掮客之間，大都少連絡，不守掮客應守的道德。例如：你在做生意，他曉得了，會暗暗地去「盜根子」，「甩盤子」，無所不用其極來搶你的生意經。所以常有打相打，吃講茶的事情發生的。</p>
<p>他們還有許多使人意料不到的詭計。在以往貨價在漲時期，你如於早晨向他買定某一種貨，言明是於下午或是明天出貨的，但貨買定後而價忽大漲，你如時打銀去出貨，有時不免出貨不到—他已將你買定的貨以更高價另售於第三者了。這大概便是所謂神仙，老虎的手段罷。自然，你要向其交貨，他只是敷衍，任憑你怎樣的痛駡，他報你以嬉皮笑臉，使你對他無法處置。</p>
<p>不過這種事情，在要「面子」講信用的人是不會有的。但話要說回來，買賣兩方，有時也失信，如賣方賣後爽約，買方買後不去出貨，這使捐客要「軋　頭」的。</p>
<p>有一種掮客，對於本份應得的佣金，很不注重。有生意，也懶得去做，他們要做甚麼呢？便是「捉阿毛」，「帽子」。所謂「捉阿毛」，「戴帽子」者，即是在賣方開出的價錢，私底下加上一個「盤子」。這種伎倆，祇有豐富經騐的老掮客方能勝任，吾則，不免就要露出馬脚來。交易如成功，賺幾百幾千塊元是不以爲事的。有如此的進入，他們自可以多幾個錢了。但是易賺也易用，佣錢一到手裏，不是跑舞塲，看影戲，上館子，便是開房間，又麻將，玩弄女人，亂花亂費。還有許多關生意的應酬，如某號「阿大」「做花頭」，老闆做大慶，小開做彌月，都須去酬酢，而且不能饋贈一點微物便算事，因爲這是他們的「衣食父母」也。</p>
<p>所以十個跑街和掮客中間，九個是積不起錢來的。他們有這樣的話：勿用勿來，辛苦銅鈿快樂用。　現在囤積之風已戢，各業生意也淸淡得很，他們無事可做，沒有收人，而吃慣用慣的，有應酬還不能不去，遂感到非常的苦悶，看他們漸漸走上沒落的途徑了。（全篇完）</p>

<h3>路程</h3>
<p>— 桀人</p>
<p>天下有兩條路；一條是　坦而開着花卉的路，一條是崎嶇並堆着亂石的路。一般初入社會平凡的人，尤其是我們靑年人，看着這兩條路，就要發生迷茫。很多人却走到平坦安適的路上去了，那條崎嶇的路最沒有人走，其實這條路最能磨鍊我們的血氣，最能使我們成爲能幹的人。自古以來，世界各國偉大的成功人，他們所以能成功，就是揀這條崎嶇之路走的呀！</p>
<p>在黑夜裏前行的時候，是艱苦的，是寂寞的，並且須要燈照。可是，黑暗僅是渦渡的幻影，嘗盡苦味，才有快樂，這苦後的樂是甜蜜的，是偉大的；也是走過黑暗才會遇見葳雜的天色，忠吿你的人就是明燈，他能使你走上成功的道路上去。</p>
<p>一位著名的航海家會說：「在在濤澎湃的海路中，最需要的是憑自己的決斷，如果猶豫不決，那無異於自殺。」路是悠綿的，可是，走就能克服它的悠綿！峻險的道路祇有愚笨的人才膽怯不進，別因路途的崎嶇而停止你的前進！人生的路途上有暴風雨，有黑暗，也有峻險的山道。</p>
<p>走吧！朋友們！去踏平世間的崎嶇，用我們大衆的力量，來開闢正義的路！從黑暗中創造出光明的大道！</p>

<p>程炳像誰？有一些像陳國器，又有一些像陳國芳，這是維城的新發現。陳國器和陳國芳，是同父同母的兄妹，像了陳國器，自然會像陳國芳，只是這個程炳怎麼會像陳國器的呢？維城經過時間的消逝，把憤怒蛻變而爲深思；坐在椅子裏，緊蹙看雙眉，昂頭，低頭，把兩手托着下巴頦，又托着後腦杓子，閉了眼想陳國器是一個什麼型，這殺人的惡魔又是一個什麼型。想的他忽然怪叫一聲，同時把右手打在他自己大腿上。這怪叫一聲，倒是引出雙梅書屋外邊的大笑一聲。黃龍在外邊哈哈哈大笑，接着門也給拽開了，一脚闖進來道。。「你原來在此地，我说到了什麽地方去了，我起先想，不見你，也不見翠珍姊，你們小倆口子，唧唧噥噥躱在那裏說話去了。我倒是想錯了，你原來在此地。裏邊有沒有翠珍姊，別在人面前說的光明正大，在人背後，姊呀弟呀的喚得熱鬧，哈哈哈。」</p>
<p>維城在聽到是黃龍來時早就搶到桌子邊，把程炳的像片往衣袋裏一塞，裝做沒事。看黃龍醉醺　的搖擺着身體闖進來，又說了不倫不類的好些話，便說道：「別瞎說，是我一個人在屋子裏。你看，我想把先嚴先慈的遺像拿下來，不料不小心，把鏡框子打爛了，這怎麼辦？」黃龍道：「打爛了，在那裏？哦，這桌子上的，是不是？」他一看，一張是葉大太太的像片，又一張，把他翻過來看，一翻時倒又讓破碎的玻璃，七零八落，掉在地下，掉在桌面上。黃龍雙手一張，舌頭一吐道：「你倒是沒有打爛，我才是打爛了。怎麼的，這個玻璃，老了，不中用，一碰就碎了。」他忙不迭從地上拾起碎玻璃來，裝在框子裏。維城道：「碎了，還有什麼用呢？」黃龍把手一拍道：「我想起來了，東屋裏有着和這一樣的框子，我去搬過來。這是誰，這是你老子呀。啊，對不起，對不起，他要活着，那我一定是挨了他的駡。」（二二一）</p>

<h3>North African Alamein Front: Large-Scale Tank Battle Unfolds; Germany Confident in Strong Defense; British Offensive Suffers Another Setback</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Domei News Agency) - The British Eighth Army on the Egyptian front launched a sudden counter-offensive in the Alamein area today. According to the Associated Press war correspondent Macmillan, the fierce battle was as follows: British tank units engaged in a fierce battle with Axis tank units in the northern Alamein area. In addition, infantry units from both sides are also engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat in the area. The British Air Force is heavily bombing Axis positions, while artillery units are also engaged in fierce combat with Axis forces with heavy artillery fire.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Haitong News Agency) - London officials confirmed yesterday that the long-rumored large-scale tank battle has begun on the Alamein front on the 2nd of this month. On the morning of that day, British and German tanks engaged in fierce combat all day, and the situation remained stalemated until night. The outcome of the war is still unknown in London. According to a special correspondent of Reuters stationed on the front line, it is too early to predict the outcome of the war.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Haitong News Agency) - Regarding the recent fighting in North Africa, responsible officials here stated yesterday that "the largest tank battle ever seen in Africa" is underway. Since the British army launched its offensive, it has lost one-third of its tanks, but the British army continued to attack yesterday, it is said.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Haitong News Agency) - Military sources here claim that the defensive strength of the German armored forces in North Africa is still superior to the British offensive power. The battle in Egypt has reached its climax, and the outcome should be decided in a short period of time. Axis aircraft have also stepped up their activities, it is said.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Haitong News Agency) - Responsible military officials here discussed the details of the large-scale tank battle that began on the Alamein front on the morning of the 2nd of this month, saying that although the British Eighth Army suffered heavy losses, its commander, Montgomery, continued to concentrate his forces to launch an offensive, attempting to break through Axis positions. Although the British offensive had been thwarted, fierce fighting continued yesterday. In the first nine days of the offensive, the British army suffered heavy losses, so it has now transferred troops from the central and southern routes of the Alamein front to the area for combat. After the British army broke through Axis positions south of Sidi El Rahman, the enemy launched a large-scale attack, and German and Italian artillery and aircraft met them with heavy fire, until the British tank units were exhausted. General Rommel then dispatched tanks to attack the enemy's flanks. The two sides fought desperately, step by step, with the Axis forces pressing the enemy to retreat. After a stalemate of several hours, the British army finally collapsed and retreated. Both sides suffered heavy losses in the battle, but the German-Italian coalition forces regained the upper hand that night, it is said.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Haitong News Agency) - According to sources here, British aircraft attempted to attack a German convoy between Crete and Africa yesterday, but were intercepted by German aircraft. Despite the disparity in numbers, the German aircraft shot down four enemy aircraft and repelled the enemy aircraft, it is said.</p>
<h3>Italian Assault Troops Reinforce the Front; Two Princes Killed in Action</h3>
<p>Rome, 4th (Haitong News Agency) - When the Italian assault troops departed from Rome last night, the people lined the streets to see them off, cheering like thunder. Fascist Party Army Chief of Staff Garibaldi also went to the station to see them off.</p>
<p>Rome, 4th (Haitong News Agency) - Princes Marescotti and Constantino of the Roman aristocratic Ruspoli family, who served as paratroopers in North Africa, were killed in action a few days ago. Other princes of the family also serve in the Italian army. One of them, Prince Carlo, is a famous pilot, it is said.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Shigemitsu Arrives in Fukuoka by Air</h3>
<p>Fukuoka, 4th (Domei News Agency) - Japanese Ambassador to China Shigemitsu arrived here by plane from Shanghai at 1:00 PM today with Secretary Shimizu. He is scheduled to take a train to Tokyo tomorrow. After disembarking, Ambassador Shigemitsu made a brief statement, saying that after the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry, the agencies of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Asia Development Board in China can carry out everything under unified command, which is truly gratifying. This time, I am returning to the country to consult the government on all matters related to my personal duties.</p>
<h3>Ishiwata Visits Commander-in-Chief Hata, Receives Reporters and Makes a Statement</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) - At 11:00 AM on the 4th, Supreme Economic Advisor Ishiwata, in his capacity as the National Government's Supreme Economic Advisor, visited Japanese Army Commander-in-Chief General Hata. The host and guest had a long conversation before he took his leave.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) - National Government Supreme Economic Advisor Sotaro Ishiwata received Japanese reporters at the International Club at noon on the 4th after visiting the Japanese General Headquarters and made the following statement: "I have assumed the position of Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government at the behest of the governments of China and Japan. However, I am ashamed of my limited talent and knowledge, and I am unable to bear this heavy responsibility. Now that I have just arrived, I can only contribute my humble efforts to live up to the expectations of the two governments. Since the National Government's return to the capital and the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the international situation is extremely critical, and the future of the economy and finance is full of obstacles. However, because of these obstacles in the future, the relationship between China and Japan will become closer. The establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry by Japan this time is also for strengthening the system of cooperation between the two countries in the construction of Greater East Asia. Although I am not talented, I am determined to do my best to assist the National Government in completing its important mission."</p>

The battle situation at that time was recorded in detail by a member of the Japanese Navy reporting team who participated in the battle. The gist is recorded as follows: At 9:15 PM on the 11th, our cruiser fleet was speeding south under the starlight. Suddenly, a fleet of enemy ships was spotted near Savo Island in the Solomon Islands. Our ships immediately launched a surprise attack. Under the intense searchlight, the enemy fleet was seen to be in a state of chaos, completely covered by our military's artillery fire. As the distance became closer, the cannons of our ships also began to bombard fiercely. At that time, one enemy ship was hit by our torpedo again, and flames shot up immediately. Upon closer inspection, it was learned that it was an enemy 10,000-ton cruiser of the Honolulu type. After burning for a short time, the fire on the sea gradually subsided. In a moment, this huge object sank to the bottom of the sea. At that time, a small destroyer in the middle of the enemy fleet was glimpsed, gradually approaching our fleet. As our ship's cannons roared, after three shots, this enemy ship disappeared below the horizon in a blaze of fire again. At the same time, a certain ship of ours approached another enemy cruiser at maximum speed. Under the combined attack of torpedoes and cannons, the enemy ship suddenly burst into flames again. The ship first slowly sank, and then was buried in the seabed in a constant burst of explosions. At the same time, another enemy cruiser had been hit by our artillery shells and was desperately sailing south while surrounded by flames. It escaped, but it is still impossible to predict whether the ship will return to its base. In this battle, although one of our cruisers was also sacrificed, the great victory has been deeply imprinted on the turbulent waves of the South Pacific, it is said.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Domei News Agency) - U.S. Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox told reporters yesterday, "Regarding the war situation in the Solomon Islands, it is not appropriate to be overly optimistic. If it causes undue hope, the danger is very great. Fierce fighting is still expected. If you suffer an unexpected setback, it will inevitably cause greater disappointment. The Japanese fleet is still very strong. To say that the war has ended is not true, it is said.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 4th (Domei News Agency) - The Greater East Asia Literary Conference held a formal meeting on the morning of the 4th. The first agenda item in the morning was the establishment of the spirit of Greater East Asia. Representatives from China, Japan, and Manchukuo all expressed their opinions enthusiastically. The gist is recorded separately below: Japanese representative Sanemori Mushanokoji said, "In order to achieve mutual cooperation among writers in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, I sincerely hope that they will actively rise up and strive to establish the culture of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and should study its methods." Chinese representative Yusheng Liu said, "Regarding the establishment of the East Asian spirit, my personal opinions are as follows: 1. Harmonizing the feelings between ethnic groups is the first step in establishing the East Asian spirit; 2. All East Asians should love East Asia, so we should use literary works to make everyone love each other, love their own country as the first step, love neighboring countries as the second step, and love East Asia together as the third step; 3. Adhering to morality and emphasizing benevolence and righteousness are the highest cultural goals of East Asia. Literature is the leader of thought and the guide of life. I hope that all East Asian writers will work together." Manchukuo representative Gu Ding said, "The spirit of Greater East Asia is the spirit of reviving Asia, which is also the spirit of the founding of Manchukuo. Ethnic harmony is the true meaning of the founding of Manchukuo. In order to build the spirit of Greater East Asia, we must liquidate the history of past ethnic struggles and expand the spirit of ethnic harmony to the entire Greater East Asia and the world. We who are engaged in literature must build a Greater East Asian literature of ethnic harmony." Chinese representative Daosun Qian said, "The spirit of East Asian civilization can be said to be represented by China, Japan, and India. That is, China's 'all people within the four seas are brothers', Japan's 'Hakko Ichiu', and India's 'one lotus flower'. The European and American spirit emphasizes profit, while the East Asian spirit emphasizes righteousness, so East Asia should take righteousness as its foundation and promote it to the world. Based on the original meaning of 'all people within the four seas are one family', East Asian countries should love, respect, and honor each other, and discover each other's strengths. After the European and American spirit flowed into East Asia, due to the difference between profit and righteousness, it was invisibly affected by its instigation. Today, East Asians should realize the original meaning of carrying the Tao with literature, seek the unity of East Asian culture, and spread it to the world, so that the world becomes a whole of true, beautiful, and good humanity."</p>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Domei News Agency) - The Greater East Asia Literary Conference continued its meeting on the afternoon of the 4th. Chinese representative Huaru Zhou and Manchukuo representative Qing Wu Ying, on the topic of the popularization and strengthening of the spirit of Greater East Asia, expressed their opinions separately. Chinese representative Huaru Zhou said, "We should promote and carry forward the inherent cultural spirit of East Asia, and at the same time liquidate the Western utilitarian thinking. If we want to strengthen the spirit of Greater East Asia, we should first pay attention to the economic life of the East Asian people and the economic prosperity of the East Asian countries. We should further promote the development of scientific and material construction to increase the well-being of all ethnic groups in East Asia. In order to promote the spirit of Greater East Asia, the East Asian nations should also work hard individually and have an organized and planned progress, so it is necessary to organize cultural institutions of the spirit of Greater East Asia to take on its tasks. The Greater East Asia Literary Conference has begun to be held and has a common goal and a common path. I firmly believe that with concerted efforts, the East Asian spirit will be strengthened and popularized." Manchukuo representative Jueqing said, "Japan is the pioneer of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The cultural spirit of Japan is worth learning from. In the future, the new culture of East Asia should also be combined with the spirit of Japan to facilitate the early completion of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." Manchukuo representative Wu Ying said, "Regarding the work of establishing, strengthening, and popularizing the spirit of Greater East Asia, I will speak from the standpoint of women. As a literary worker, I should especially promote and popularize the inherent feminine virtues of the East."</p>

<h3>Captured British and American Aircraft and Weapons to be Transported to an Exhibition</h3>

<h3>Yang Zhonghua Granted Amnesty by Order</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) - Order of the National Government (November 4, 1942): The five years and six months of imprisonment that Yang Zhonghua should have served are hereby granted amnesty, and he shall still be strictly supervised by the Motor Transport Committee. This order is issued by Chairman Wang Zhaoming and President Wen Zongyao of the Judicial Yuan.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) - The original report of the Military Affairs Committee's trial of Yang Zhonghua is transcribed below: According to the report of Liu Dufen, the chief judge of the High Military Law Court of the Army, and judges Bao Wenyue, Xiao Shuxuan, Da-yi Ying, and Xixian Zhang, etc., the undersigned, having been instructed to try the case of Yang Zhonghua, the dismissed commander-in-chief of the Second Group Army, for violating laws and regulations, have completed several trials and have decided to sentence Yang Zhonghua to five years of imprisonment for illegally collecting donations, three years of imprisonment for embezzling funds, and a combined execution of five years and six months of imprisonment. The remaining parts are proposed to be declared not guilty. Whether or not this is appropriate, we have prepared a written report and attached the full volume for your review. The case file is attached. According to this, it is found that Yang Zhonghua, who held an important position, actually acted illegally and committed crimes, and should be punished with the deserved punishment. However, considering that the official was ordered last year to go to northern Jiangsu to recruit troops and traveled to various counties, he was quite diligent and has contributed to the country's military building. We earnestly request your Majesty to be lenient and grant him amnesty, and hand him over to the Military Affairs Committee for strict supervision and observe his subsequent effects. Whether this is feasible, we hereby submit a written report for your consideration. Respectfully submitted to Chairman Wang Zhaoming,</p>

<h3>Contribution of Several Opinions on the Youth Movement - Broadcast Speech by Minister of Propaganda Lin</h3>
<p>Fellow compatriots, fellow youths, this mission to Japan, in addition to attending the East Asia Roundtable Conference, has the main task of studying the organization and training of young people in friendly nations. I departed at the end of September, passed through Beijing in October, and returned to the capital, spending a month in total. The time spent inspecting various parts of Japan was a total of three weeks. Regarding the organization and training of young men and women, school youth, vocational youth, factory youth, rural youth, and army, navy, and air force youth in friendly nations, there are truly too many things seen and heard in terms of spirit and technique that are worthy of emulation. I am currently organizing materials with my colleagues, intending to write an inspection report in the near future to contribute to the government and the youth of the entire country. Today, I would like to present a few points that are most noteworthy in the spirit of this inspection of the organization and training of youth in friendly nations to provide a brief report to everyone.</p>
<p>First, the efforts of the leaders of youth groups in friendly nations are entirely for the purpose of training young people and cultivating strength for the country, and absolutely not for establishing personal power. Everyone only knows how to contribute everything for the country and for East Asia. The national strength of friendly nations is flourishing and has reached its current state, which is by no means accidental. Our China has had a youth movement for a long time, not just since today. The youth movement occupies a very important position in the National Revolution. Since the revolution, the efforts and spirit of sacrifice of young comrades are truly admirable. However, in the development of the youth movement over the past two decades, there has been a major shortcoming that we should deeply reflect on and correct. Many people engaged in the youth movement always use the youth movement as a personal tool, placing young people in their personal pockets, using the patriotic spirit of young people, using the enthusiasm of young people to participate in the revolution, to create personal positions. Once the goal has been achieved, they abandon young people, or even trample on them. For more than twenty years, various political movements have been rife with small organizations, and the political situation has been turbulent, so that young people started with sincerity, then diverged in opinions, and finally became depressed and bewildered. It can be said that all of this is born from this. Today, we are in a serious situation of life and death, and we can no longer allow the use of young people to establish personal power. We should do our best, unite sincerely, train young people, and cultivate strength to dedicate it to the leader, to the party, to the country, to East Asia. The spirit of the leaders of youth groups in friendly nations to contribute strength to the country and to East Asia is worthy of us taking as an example. If the New National Movement wants to eliminate individualism in organization and training, it must start with the leaders themselves. I should first reflect on myself and encourage all youth leaders in the country to do the same. Second, the people of friendly nations, men, women, old and young, all have a kind of serious and solemn sincerity. No matter what they do, they are absolutely not perfunctory or irresponsible. One day, just when the American air raid conspiracy was announced, we went out early in the morning to visit, and along the way, we saw personnel engaged in air raid drills. Regardless of men or women, wearing air raid clothing and hats, some were stationed, some were practicing, until late at night it was still the same. Almost the entire city of Tokyo was mobilized to engage in air raid drills. The restaurants and entertainment venues were the same. They were not perfunctory at all, but serious and solemn. A few days later, we visited female university students and participated in air raid drills. That day, it was raining heavily. The school authorities sought the opinions of the students, and they said that there would be air raids even when it rained, so naturally they had to practice. As a result, they did it faithfully according to the planned plan. The lifelike situation, teams of firefighters, poison gas teams, and casualty teams, in the pouring rain, were like fighting in a hail of bullets. They were not perfunctory at all, but very serious and very solemn. This spirit of the people of friendly nations can be seen anytime and anywhere. I am just giving one example now. Thinking back over the past five or six years, whether in actual air raids or in hypothetical drills, only a very few people who could not but be responsible were working hard. Most people either stood by and watched or fled in panic. Alas, we are born here, and we will die here. Where can we escape to? If we ourselves are not seriously responsible, who will be responsible? This is another point that I should reflect on and take as an example.</p>
<p>Third, the organization and training of young people in friendly nations are aimed at winning the war and postwar construction, with national defense training as the warp and diligent service as the weft. They are able to comprehensively consider the situation in various places, the jobs of individuals, and their work abilities. For school youth, they are not told to abandon their studies and only know how to put up slogans and shout slogans. Instead, in the organization and training, they supplement the efficiency of education, give play to the instincts of young people, and train the students' bodies and minds, so that they can be more upward and more effective for the country and society. For factory youth, they are not told to leave their posts without permission and only know how to hold meetings and clamor, and engage in intrigue to increase labor-management disputes. Instead, in the organization and training, they are given spiritual education and technical training, so that they can better coordinate labor and management and increase production, which is to increase the strength of the country. It is the same for rural youth. Which place needs to be reclaimed, which river needs to be dredged, they mobilize according to actual needs. Young people participate in labor. Also, during the busy farming season, teams of young ladies from the city go to the countryside to take care of children for the farmers, cook food, and every task has practical needs, achieving practical results. It is beneficial to young people, beneficial to the countryside, and beneficial to the country. It is definitely not like us, telling young students to sweep the streets and plant trees, just to do propaganda.</p>
<p>What has been said above is just what I have observed, regarding the excellent spirit of the youth movement in friendly nations, which is precisely what China urgently needs. I have specially pointed out two or three points to report to compatriots across the country. As for the specific issues of organization and training, because our national systems and national conditions are not entirely the same, we carefully examined them with the two principles of "seeing the similarities in the differences and seeing the differences in the similarities, taking the strengths of others to make up for our own shortcomings." I feel that the places that can be used for reference cannot be summarized in a few simple words. I can only leave it to a written report.</p>
<p>Finally, there is one more point that I want to solemnly report. During this inspection, under the wartime system, we saw that the social organization of friendly nations is more rigorous, the essence of economic strength is more solid, and the national spirit is more vibrant. I know that the Greater East Asia War not only has the belief of certain victory, but also the conviction of certain victory. What is especially worthy of our admiration is the highest degree and purest patriotism of men, women, old and young throughout the country. From this, we have a deeper understanding of the enthusiasm and sincerity of young people in friendly nations towards China. Only with this highest degree of patriotism can they dedicate everything to the country, so they can be serious and solemn in everything, so they can endure hardship and be brave and diligent. Only with this pure patriotism can they expand their patriotism and love East Asia, so they can extend what they love to others. Although our two countries have experienced grievous changes in the past few decades, there has always been a symphony of the purest hearts in the depths of the hearts of young people in both countries. This is entirely due to the purest feelings of loving the country and loving East Asia. In the short period of three weeks, no matter what the occasion, the enthusiasm and sincerity of young people in friendly nations towards us really moved us too much. This enthusiasm and sincerity is not towards me personally, but towards China, towards Chinese youth, towards Chinese youth who love China, love Japan, and love East Asia. We are confident that due to the symphony of the hearts of young people in the two countries, young people in the two countries will be able to unite and build into teams of iron troops to defend East Asia. It can be asserted that the youth of friendly nations have taken big steps on the road to defending East Asia. How should we work hard to move forward? This is what we should deeply encourage ourselves. I have nothing else to say today. I am willing to follow the youth of the country and further strengthen my determination and efforts to promote the New National Movement. I sincerely wish the youth of China to unite and create a youth China, and wish the youth of East Asia to unite and create a youth East Asia.</p>

The value is self-evident, but this trump card is now in our hands, and we have no intention of giving it up. As for the battle to defend the port of Dakar in the future, it will definitely not be the so-called 'war of honor,' because the glory of France has not wavered. We defend it in order to preserve this colony, not just for honor. And the way to preserve it depends on our own strength, so we hold French West Africa and will never give it up. All of us French must unite as one. Today, since we have a famous Verdun general as our leader, we should immediately eliminate all political opinions and restore the spirit of Verdun."</p>

<h3>Notification from Edible Oil Wholesale Department - Selling Off All Stocked Oil - Applying for Transportation and Movement Certificates</h3>
<p>Hundreds of Oil Merchants Suspend Distribution Due to Price Increases</p>
<p>Recently, due to hoarding by some merchants, there has been unrest regarding edible oil in the city. The trade association wholesale department specifically stated: (1) The current amount of oil in the city is still very sufficient, and there is no need to worry about a shortage in the foreseeable future. (2) Currently, the production of Shanghai oil factories is approximately 1,000 dan per day, which is more than enough to meet the daily needs of Shanghai. Even if the operating rate of oil factories decreases in the future due to the inability to transport raw materials from all sources, the existing oil can also be used to compensate. (3) Several factories in Pudong and Puxi already exist, and in addition to supplying local needs, a portion can also be transported into the city. Therefore, the supply and demand situation of edible oil in the city should ease in the future. As for the black market for edible oil, it is created by profiteers. The department has conducted a thorough investigation and will thoroughly crack down on it. It has been confirmed that the retail stores that have raised prices have been stopped from distributing oil. There are two or three hundred of them. Therefore, there are currently more than 1,800 stores that are distributing edible oil.</p>
<p>Notification</p>
<p>The Shanghai Edible Oil Trade Association Wholesale Department issued a notification to all edible oil retail stores yesterday, saying, "As above, this office has learned that the supply organizations for the edible oil needed in the Shanghai area are military distribution organizations. As for this office, it is only responsible for distribution. When it was established, this office applied for a monthly need of edible oil to be set at 40,000 dan, and at least 30,000 dan. However, in the past nine months, the monthly supply has only been about 20,000 dan. After a separate allocation to the wine and food industries, only about 17,000 dan can be distributed to various guilds. If we divide this number equally among 2,000 members, each member will receive 8 dan and 50 jin per month. It is not surprising that this number is not enough to meet sales. However, according to the principle of allocating materials, the number of members cannot be used as a unit, and it must be based on the past historical business situation and the amount of registration applied for to determine the amount of allocation. Therefore, the amount of allocation for smaller member retail stores will naturally be even less. Therefore, in terms of the number of members and the past supply of edible oil, this is the real reason why this office has had difficulty in fulfilling members' requests to increase the amount of oil or apply to join the oil distribution. Now that the winter season is approaching and oil sales are stronger, this wholesale department is well aware of the situation and has repeatedly requested the authorities to increase the amount. However, for various reasons, this wish has not been fulfilled. Recently, it has not been possible to apply for transportation and movement certificates for oil transportation due to changes in the competent authorities.</p>
<p>This office is now requesting the authorities to find a way to deal with the aftermath to maintain the situation. Once approved, a notification will be issued again. As for the oil in stock of your members, you should sell it all off as soon as possible to meet the needs of the citizens. Please do not hoard it, lest the authorities find out and impose penalties. This is to inform you, I hope you will take note of it."</p>
<h3>Factories Start Buying Raw Wheat</h3>
<p>Limited Price of 180 Yuan Per Dan</p>
<p>After the China Communications Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Shanghai-Central Bank, and other banks agreed to lend money to Fuxin, Zaofeng, and other flour mills to purchase raw wheat from various places, the factories have all obtained permission from the Japanese authorities. Under the control of the China Central Flour Milling Association, they purchased raw wheat from Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and other producing areas. It is said that the authorities have set a limited price of 180 yuan per dan in Central Reserve Certificates for raw wheat. They are trying to transport the wheat collected to Shanghai to start manufacturing flour. As for the flour mills of Japanese merchants, they have purchased wheat from Zhenjiang, Qingpu, and other places with loans from Japanese banks. A joint entity organized by 26 Japanese merchants is preparing to strictly control the work of purchasing raw wheat in the Wuhu area.</p>
<h3>New Measures Will Be Formulated for Sugar Supply</h3>
<p>Half of the Crowds Rushing to Buy Resell at High Prices - Thoroughly Eliminating Behind-the-Scenes Operations to Restore the Situation</p>
<p>The English-language Great American Evening Post reported that a certain official of the Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office met with reporters this morning (4th) and stated emphatically that there is absolutely no problem with the sugar supply, and the sugar in stock at the cooperative business office is sufficient for the needs of this year and next year.</p>
<p>Eliminating Speculation and Fair Distribution</p>
<p>The office is currently drafting measures for the fair distribution of sugar and the elimination of illegal speculators, and has recently issued additional regulations regarding the retail of sugar in order to reduce black market activities and prevent hoarding and speculation. After these regulations are put into effect, special supervisors will be sent to supervise the prices and quantities of sugar sold by registered retailers. The sugar situation in this city has not yet recovered, but the office's efforts to crack down on black market activities have achieved satisfactory results.</p>
<p>The Sugar in Stock Can Last for More Than a Year</p>
<p>The existing sugar in stock is quite sufficient, not only sufficient for this year's use, but also for next year and beyond. What's more, the source of sugar has been opened, and there is no possibility of a shortage. Therefore, residents do not need to alarm each other and should not rush to buy sugar. According to the office's investigation, half of the crowds rushing to buy sugar at retail stores are doing so for the purpose of reselling it at high prices. Therefore, it is stipulated that sugar can only be purchased with a citizen's card, which is aimed at preventing illegal profiteers from reselling it at high prices or transporting it to other areas. Regarding the restoration of the normal state of sugar supply here, the office has studied ways to ensure fair distribution and has drafted a plan that will be submitted to the authorities for final consideration and approval. The official stated at the end that there is absolutely no shortage of sugar supply in Shanghai. The unfortunate situation that exists at present is all caused by unfounded rumors. The Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office is doing its best to remedy the situation and bring it back on track.</p>
<h3>Clearing of Trust Deposits - First Refund Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Central Trust Bureau, located at 592 Foch Road, 2nd Floor, which is being liquidated, began to refund the first deposit at 10:00 a.m. yesterday (4th). The amount refunded per household was 1,000 yuan, and the funds paid by the same industry from December 9, 1941, to September 13, 1942, were included. Those with deposits of more than 5,000 yuan must indicate that they are not hostile before they can be paid. It is said that yesterday (4th), many depositors went to withdraw their deposits enthusiastically.</p>
<h3>Inaugural Meeting of the Shanghai Branch of the Indian Independence League</h3>
<p>The Indians in Shanghai, with the Indian Independence League headquarters in Bangkok, are fighting for the freedom and independence of their motherland. They deeply feel that the Indian compatriots in this city also need to rise up and respond. Therefore, they proceeded with preparatory work. Six Indian groups in the city jointly organized the Shanghai branch of the Indian Independence League. The preparations have now been completed, and the inaugural meeting was held at the Racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road from 2:00 p.m. on the 2nd. More than 1,000 representatives from various factions and Indians from all walks of life participated.

<h3>Speculators Released on Bail Violate Promise to Await Summons</h3>
<p>Twelve Brokers Will Be Summoned to Explain Reasons</p>
<p>It is learned that speculators who were arrested for engaging in black market activities from July 25 to September 30 were released on bail at their request on October 29. However, these people did not appear in court for trial on the previous (3rd) court date. Therefore, the parties concerned will summon the 12 brokers who were released on bail again within two weeks to explain the reason for their failure to appear in court. It is said that they expressed considerable surprise at the failure of these 12 brokers to keep their promise to appear in court for retrial. Therefore, they hope to obtain the reasons for their failure to appear in court at the next interrogation and expect the rest of those arrested to also appear in court. Looking back at the arrests of speculators in September, only 12 representatives from various firms were summoned to court. Most of the firm representatives admitted their guilt and expressed their obedience to the notification issued by the Public Works Department regarding the prohibition of speculation. From then on, they will no longer engage in black market activities, and the Huo Nuoqian Company has changed its business to the trading of stock certificates and goods pledges. It is stipulated that a profit of 10 yuan will be drawn for every 10,000 yuan of bonds. Before July 25, the company engaged in speculation and made a profit of 2 yuan for every package of cotton cloth sold. It is also learned that because reports of rampant black market activity in this port have been received, the police are continuing to investigate and make arrests.</p>

<h3>Statement by Japanese Ambassador to Shanghai, Mr. Tajiri</h3>
<p>Mr. Tajiri Aiyi, the newly appointed Japanese Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Shanghai, arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the 3rd. On the morning of the 4th, at 10:30 AM, he met with reporters for the first time on the sixth floor of the Broadway Mansions, stating: "The Japanese government has newly established the Greater East Asia Ministry, and the local organizations in China and their operations are being consolidated in a unified manner. A new embassy office has been established in Shanghai, and I have been entrusted with this significant responsibility. The scope of affairs of the Shanghai Embassy Office will broadly cover political, economic, and cultural matters in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. We intend to closely coordinate and cooperate with the command headquarters to carry out the affairs under our jurisdiction. Shanghai and its surrounding areas are quite important in terms of the position and development of the National Government. It is also important in terms of constructing Greater East Asia and completing the Greater East Asia War. Our responsibility is to further develop this position and increase its value beyond what it is today. We should consider that the Greater East Asia War is a war that progresses in conjunction with construction. Looking back at history, past wars ended due to exhaustion, and construction began afterward. But today is different. We are engaging in construction while fighting the war. This is a characteristic of the Greater East Asia War. Although the phrase 'war and construction progress in conjunction' is simple, it contains a very significant meaning. This point should be deeply recognized. After a deep understanding, a new awareness will emerge. The idea of construction while fighting the war is to cultivate combat power, which is an indispensable necessity and a major task of the embassy office. As for the National Government of the Republic of China, construction in the political, economic, and cultural aspects is necessary to establish friendly relations between the people of China and Japan. Therefore, broadly speaking, the people of China and Japan, centered on Shanghai, should, in the Yangtze River area, respond to military demands with mutual trust and harmonious cooperation to complete the war. At the same time, we should strive to make the people of both countries respect each other and foster harmonious feelings to establish friendly relations. If this construction is successful, a new order based on the spirit of benevolence and righteousness can be established in East Asia. If there are still remnants of British and American influence in East Asia, they will surely be eliminated. Furthermore, although people from Japan's allied countries are active in various places, they must deeply recognize the situation and cooperate with Japan to achieve construction. In short, the construction of Greater East Asia is a very important undertaking that must be carried out step by step. I hold a firm will and hope that all overseas Chinese and gentlemen of the Republic of China will have a deep understanding, share the responsibility of cooperation and construction in Greater East Asia, and provide continued cooperation and guidance in the future."</p>
<p>Address to Subordinates</p>
<p>(Our Correspondent in Shanghai) The newly appointed Ambassador to Shanghai, Tajiri Aiyi, delivered his first address to over 600 embassy officials yesterday morning (Wednesday), pointing out that closer cooperation among all officials is essential for the Shanghai Embassy to operate smoothly. He said, "We have colleagues from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the East Asia Bureau, but from now on, we will be working together in the Greater East Asia Ministry, and we should strive to enhance cooperation." He recalled the speech given by Minister Aoki of the Greater East Asia Ministry in Tokyo, hoping for cooperation among colleagues, simplification of procedures, and regularization of official regulations. Therefore, Tajiri urged the embassy officials here to set an example not only for the Japanese in Shanghai but also for the people of third countries. In the afternoon, Tajiri, accompanied by the newly appointed Minister to Nanjing, Horiuchi Kaneki, visited the Shanghai Shrine and various Japanese organizations.</p>
<p>Talk by Japanese Consul General</p>
<p>Mr. Yano Seiki, the newly appointed Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, arrived on the evening of the 3rd. At 4:30 PM on the 4th, he met with a group of reporters for the first time in the Consul General's office at the Consulate General, and gave a brief statement: "I am deeply honored to be appointed as the Consul General of Shanghai, despite my humble abilities. At the same time, I deeply feel that the responsibility is extremely heavy and great. All previous Consuls General in Shanghai have been capable and efficient individuals. I am deeply apprehensive about being appointed as the first Consul General after the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War on December 8th of last year, the situation has taken a sharp turn. This time, in order to achieve the goals of the war, the government has established the Greater East Asia Ministry. The mission of this Consulate General is to respond to this new situation, to work together with the Japanese in Shanghai, and to join hands with Chinese people to strengthen the rear defenses and echo the brilliant achievements of the soldiers on the front lines, with the aim of establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. I will also devote all my efforts to fulfill my responsibilities. I hope that the Japanese people in Shanghai will continue to support the Consulate General and provide cooperation."</p>

<h3>Vita-Fu Cup Volleyball Charity Match, Soviet Team Corrects Competition Name</h3>
<p>The Vita-Fu Cup China-Russia volleyball charity match has concluded. Yesterday, the captain of the Soviet team, Mr. Mi Weiguv, stated in a letter that the team did not participate in the competition and should be corrected. Upon investigation, the "Soviet" in the Vita-Fu Cup China-"Soviet" volleyball charity match was actually a mistake for "Russia." The team that competed against Xingren was Russian expatriates, not the Soviet team. Therefore, the name of the China-Soviet charity match seems inappropriate.</p>
<h3>Sunset at an Ancient Temple</h3>
<p>The Tuberculosis Prevention Society's photography exhibition opens today, featuring many exquisite works. The light and angles of this frame are extremely beautiful.</p>
<h3>A Tour of the Six Major Libraries, Rich in Collections (Part 4)</h3>
<p>The time for borrowing books from the library is limited to weekdays; there is no borrowing on Sundays. The opening hours of Xin Ya are from 9:30 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM. During the summer, there is no break at noon, and the library closes at 2:00 PM. Zhen Dan's borrowing hours start at 8:30 AM and 3:00 PM, each lasting for two hours. The Public Concession Library is open for borrowing as soon as it opens.</p>
<p>Because there are many people borrowing books at Xin Ya, it is not easy to borrow them. You have to request many books each time to borrow one or two. Popular books, such as Ba Jin's novels, postal books during the postal examination period, and current insurance books, are extremely difficult to borrow. Often, you request many and still can't borrow one. When borrowing books elsewhere, you have to write a slip of paper for each book, which the library uses as proof. You can select books yourself in the stacks of the Public Concession Library. If you don't know how to select, you can ask for a card, check the number and author in the catalog, write them on the card, write your address and name on the back, and drop it into the card box. If the book is available, it will be mailed to you in two or three days; then you can go to pick it up. Xin Ya also has this procedure, but it is limited to pre-ordering books that are difficult to borrow.</p>
<p>An ordinary library card can borrow two books. Xin Ya limits it to one. The Public Concession Library has three, but students can only borrow two. Xin Ya only lends books for one week, the Public Concession Library and Ming Fu for one week, and Zhen Dan for one month. They must be returned by the deadline, otherwise a fine will be charged. Xin Ya charges five cents per day, and other places charge ten cents. If you want to continue reading, you can bring the book to the library to renew it. The renewal period is the same as the borrowing period. Some thick books at Xin Ya are automatically renewed for one to three weeks, but even with so much time, you still can't finish reading them, and the renewal period is still only one week.</p>
<p>Borrowed books should naturally be cherished. Many readers like to criticize, scold, or complain in books, which is really meaningless. Some people tear out good pages when they see them, and even want to misappropriate things from the library for their own benefit if there is a profit to be made. The books in the Xin Ya library that are not from major bookstores such as Commercial Press and Zhonghua Bookstore are often not priced at the original price, and these books are mostly out of print and very valuable, so I would like to suggest that the library pay more attention to them. In my opinion, the value of a book lies in its soul, not its body. If you understand the main points of the book clearly, the body of the book will be useless to you. On the contrary, those who are meticulous about the body of the book must be people who are unwilling to read books. Although the body of the book is in your hands, the soul of the book still does not belong to you.</p>
<p>Further Discussion</p>
<p>The current publishing industry is very lonely and depressing, which reduces the courage of book readers a lot. The most common are two views. Some conservatives think that rice prices are expensive and they can't even afford to eat, so they can't do anything about it, so why buy books? Another group of very new people think that there are no new magazines, so why read books?</p>
<p>Regarding the first question, I think buying books is good, but borrowing books is not necessarily bad. The value of a book is the value of the soul of the book, not the value of the body of the book. Therefore, the more seriously you read, the faster the value of the body is lost; the more you read, the more the value of the body is lost. From this point of view, borrowing books is more cost-effective than buying books. If you like to read outside and are greedy for comfort, then it is not impossible to borrow books to your home. Ordinary books in the library can be borrowed, and more specialized books can be read in the library, which is sometimes more focused than at home, and can achieve greater results.</p>
<p>Regarding the second question, I don't think anyone can completely read the old books, so new books are very necessary, but old books cannot be lacking. All new ideas and academics cannot emerge out of thin air; they all evolve and emerge from older ideas and academics. If we trace back from the present, we will definitely find its origins. This will definitely be very helpful for the effect of reading. Moreover, since all new things are based on the old, then understanding more about the old means being able to absorb more of the new. Therefore, reading older books is not necessarily useless. This is not only an expedient measure when there are no new books, but also an effort that should be made when there are new books. (The End)</p>

<h3>Public Debt Sellers Flood the Market, Price Falls Further</h3>
<p>The gray market price of public bonds fell further yesterday. There was a flood of consistent sellers, and the market price fell by two yuan.

Generally speaking, major holders were looking for a way out, and consistent sellers still had goods to deliver. Yesterday, the northern gang's buying appetite was stronger, but it was ultimately overwhelmed by the outflow from major holders. This situation is because the news has not yet been officially released, and is still in a state of secrecy. Yesterday, Class C started low by about 1.5 yuan, and then fell another yuan. Sellers stopped in the middle, and retail investors and the northern gang absorbed the supply. Suddenly, it rebounded by 2.5 yuan. Near the close, powerful major holders suddenly flooded the market with sales again, and the price fell another 1.5 yuan. Fluctuations were sudden, and the result was a uniform decline of 0.7 to 2 yuan. Class D also broke the 50 yuan mark. The trading volume was about 3.5 million yuan.

<h3>Gold Jewelry at Silver Shops: 2,600 Yuan</h3>
<p>In the gold jewelry market of the major silver shops in the city, the quoted price per tael at the beginning of the day was slightly flat, but at around 10 o'clock, it rose by 50 yuan to 2,600 yuan (the buying price was reduced by about 300 yuan). The intra-industry price suddenly rose. The rise in the Allied Union Coupons was stimulated by rumors of profitable purchases. It opened at 2,345 yuan in the morning, which was 35 yuan higher. In the continuous buying frenzy, it rose to a high of 2,380 yuan, and then fell back to 2,350 yuan.

<h3>Commercial Briefs</h3>
<p>Dried Oysters Not Yet in Peak Season: Dried oysters are a specialty of the Guangbang (Guangdong) merchants, and the peak sales season will not arrive until mid-winter. The Cantonese people especially like to use this ingredient to cook porridge in winter, so the sales volume is relatively high. Currently, the market price for eastern goods is 4,200 yuan, and actual sales have not moved.</p>
<p>West Sand Rice Difficult to Transport: West Sand rice is experiencing tight prices due to a lack of supply and difficulty in transporting subsequent batches. The market price the other day was 7,000 yuan per load, but yesterday the market price was 7,200 yuan, with signs of further tightening.</p>
<p>Soap Prices Soaring: The cigarette market is stable and firm, with prices generally similar to the previous day. However, among daily necessities, soap prices are soaring significantly due to hoarding. Gu Ben soap has risen to 400 yuan per box, Bai Xiangmao soap to 350 yuan, Huang Xiangmao soap to 290 yuan, and Scissors soap to 360 yuan, an increase of 20 yuan per item compared to the previous day. Therefore, people's livelihoods are threatened. Match prices are still stable, but there is a general sense of optimism. Phoenix brand is 2,400 yuan, Beautiful brand is 2,550 yuan, showing a slight increase. Whiteley's Ship brand is 185 yuan, a good start of 5 cents. Monk Hat brand is 155 yuan, and miscellaneous brands are 130 yuan, which are stable.</p>

<h3>The Spirit of Sacrifice</h3>
<p>— Gao Jiaji</p>
<p>That night, it was already past ten o'clock when suddenly I heard loud siren wails outside. I ran to the window to see what was happening and saw people running northwards. Then, looking up, I saw thick smoke billowing behind the houses across the street, flames reaching the sky, and sparks flying everywhere. It turned out that the low houses in front were on fire.</p>
<p>Soon, fire trucks came rushing in, and the firefighters began to work busily, and the situation suddenly became tense. Because the front was crowded with people and the patrol police were deployed to maintain order, we could not get close to the disaster area and could only watch the fire from a distance.</p>
<p>Six or seven-year-old children, holding the quilts they had just warmed in their sleep, fled from the disaster area. Mothers held their children, some taking rickshaws to carry their luggage, in a state of panic and misery. This continued until late at night before the fire was finally extinguished. But already, several thousand people were homeless and had to spend the night under the open sky.</p>
<p>The next morning, I went to the disaster area to see the aftermath. About five or six hundred houses had been burned to the ground, including one or two small factories. The beams and pillars were charred, and the bricks and tiles were blackened. Remnants of wheels, machine parts, water pipes, and boilers were scattered all over the ground. The victims, supporting the old and carrying the young, were digging through the ashes, hoping against hope to salvage some of their lost belongings.</p>
<p>In the disaster area, I suddenly discovered a row of houses that had been half-demolished. The contents of the upper and lower floors were clearly visible. To the south of this row of houses, everything was burned to the ground, while to the north of this row, everything was intact. Undoubtedly, this was part of the work done by the firefighters last night. This row of houses was sacrificed to protect the other houses.</p>
<p>There are many times when we too should have this spirit of decisively demolishing a house as a sacrifice. In order to protect the people we love, and their lives and property, and to avoid mutual destruction, we should sometimes sacrifice money, sacrifice our careers, sacrifice our positions, sacrifice our generous incomes, sacrifice our material pleasures, and even sacrifice our own lives.</p>
<p>Such a spirit of sacrifice, which Buddhists call "giving," is great.</p>

<h3>The Mediators of Goods</h3>
<p>— Kai Zhi</p>
<p>(3) Hard-Earned Money is Spent Happily</p>
<p>Brokers often have little contact with each other and do not adhere to the ethics that brokers should follow. For example, if you are doing business and they find out, they will secretly try to "steal the root," "dump the plate," using any means to snatch your business. So, fights and tea talks often occur.</p>
<p>They also have many unexpected tricks. In the past, when prices were rising, if you bought a certain kind of goods from them in the morning, specifying that they would be delivered in the afternoon or the next day, but the price suddenly rose sharply after you bought them, you might not receive the goods when you sent the money to pick them up – they had already sold the goods you had bought to a third party at a higher price. This is probably what is meant by the methods of gods and tigers. Naturally, if you ask them to deliver the goods, they will just prevaricate, and no matter how much you scold them, they will respond with a smile, leaving you with no way to deal with them.</p>
<p>However, such things do not happen to people who value "face" and keep their word. But on the other hand, both the buyer and the seller sometimes break their promises, such as the seller reneging after selling, or the buyer not picking up the goods after buying, which forces the brokers to "square accounts."</p>
<p>There is a kind of broker who does not pay much attention to the commission they deserve. They are too lazy to do business, so what do they do? They "catch Amaos" and "wear hats." "Catching Amaos" and "wearing hats" means secretly adding a "plate" to the price offered by the seller. Only experienced old brokers can do this skillfully; otherwise, they will inevitably reveal their true colors. If the transaction is successful, earning hundreds or thousands of dollars is nothing. With such income, they can have more money. But it is easy come, easy go. As soon as the commission is in hand, they either run to the dance hall, watch movies, go to restaurants, or rent rooms, play mahjong, play with women, and spend money recklessly. There are also many business-related social engagements, such as someone in a company "making a big deal," the boss celebrating a major event, or the young master celebrating a full moon, all of which require them to socialize, and they cannot simply give a small gift, because these are their "bread and butter."</p>
<p>Therefore, nine out of ten runners and brokers cannot save money. They have this saying: "If you don't spend it, it won't come; hard-earned money is spent happily." Now that the trend of hoarding has subsided, and business in various industries is very quiet, they have nothing to do, no income, and they are used to eating and spending, and they still have to attend social engagements, so they feel very depressed, and you can see them gradually heading towards decline.

<h3>The Road</h3>
<p>— Jie Ren</p>
<p>There are two roads in the world; one is a flat road with flowers blooming, and the other is a rugged road piled with rocks. Ordinary people who are new to society, especially our young people, will feel confused when looking at these two roads. Many people go to the flat and comfortable road, and no one walks the rugged road. In fact, this road can best temper our blood and energy and enable us to become capable people. Since ancient times, the great successful people in various countries of the world have succeeded because they chose to walk this rugged road!</p>
<p>Walking in the dark is difficult and lonely, and requires a light. However, darkness is only a transient illusion; only after tasting bitterness can there be happiness, and the happiness after bitterness is sweet and great; and only after walking through the darkness will you encounter the magnificent colors of the sky. The person who advises you is the bright light, which can lead you to the road to success.</p>
<p>A famous navigator would say, "In the turbulent sea, the most important thing is to rely on your own judgment. If you hesitate, it is tantamount to suicide." The road is long, but walking can overcome its length! Only fools are afraid to walk on dangerous roads, so don't stop your progress because of the ruggedness of the road! On the road of life, there are storms, darkness, and dangerous mountain paths.</p>
<p>Go! Friends! Let's flatten the ruggedness of the world and use the power of the masses to open up the path of righteousness! Create a bright path from the darkness!</p>

<h3>Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(10) Flying Peak</p>
<p>Who does Cheng Bing resemble? He somewhat resembles Chen Guoqi, and also somewhat resembles Chen Guofang. This is Wei Cheng's new discovery. Chen Guoqi and Chen Guofang are siblings from the same parents. If he resembles Chen Guoqi, he will naturally resemble Chen Guofang, but how could this Cheng Bing resemble Chen Guoqi? As time passed, Wei Cheng transformed his anger into deep thought. Sitting in his chair, he furrowed his brows, looked up, looked down, supported his chin with his hands, and then supported the back of his head, closing his eyes to think about what kind of person Chen Guoqi was, and what kind of person this murderous demon was. While thinking, he suddenly let out a strange cry and slapped his thigh with his right hand. This strange cry elicited a loud laugh from outside Shuangmei Shuwu. Huang Long laughed loudly outside and then yanked open the door and barged in, saying, "So you were here. I was wondering where you had gone. At first, I thought, I couldn't find you or Sister Cuizhen. You two were whispering secrets somewhere. I was wrong, you were here. Is Sister Cuizhen inside? Don't be so upright in front of people, but behind their backs, you call each other 'sister' and 'brother' so enthusiastically, hahaha."</p>
<p>When Wei Cheng heard that it was Huang Long, he quickly rushed to the table, stuffed Cheng Bing's photo into his pocket, and pretended that nothing had happened. Seeing Huang Long swaying in drunk, saying many nonsensical words, he said, "Don't talk nonsense, I'm alone in the room. You see, I wanted to take down the portraits of my late parents, but I accidentally broke the frame. What should I do?" Huang Long said, "Broke it? Where is it? Oh, on this table, right?" He took a look, one was a photo of Mrs. Ye Da, and the other, he turned it over, but when he turned it, the broken glass fell to the ground and on the table. Huang Long spread his hands and stuck out his tongue, saying, "You didn't break it, I broke it. What's wrong, this glass is old and useless, it breaks as soon as you touch it." He hurriedly picked up the broken glass from the ground and put it back in the frame. Wei Cheng said, "It's broken, what's the use?" Huang Long clapped his hands and said, "I remember, there's a frame like this in the east room, I'll go get it. Who is this, is this your father? Ah, sorry, sorry, if he were alive, I would definitely be scolded by him." (221)</p>
