<h3 id="c20">德國傘兵編練小史（八） <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>現在來看一看傘兵攻勢所用的方法，也是一件有興味的事。在對蘇戰事中，母須應用這全部技術，因爲沒有海洋的阻隔，不必變更飛機戰車攻勢，但是德國果眞企圖侵人英倫的話，就得應用傘兵攻勢，並有兩種重要的輔冀：一是沿海峽長距離射程大砲的掩護砲火，一是海面上海陸軍的聯合進攻。</p>
<p>下面就是標準化傘兵攻擊的全部過程，尙係初次公佈於世，但在克里特戰役中巳極度施展過了。全程可以淸楚劃分做十二個步驟，通常並規定開戰後一小時內須佔據重要機塲至少一處，否則全部戰事都趕不上預算了。</p>
<p>一·最高統帥選定進攻目標，空軍參謀部即對此作詳盡硏究，並擬定進攻計劃。</p>
<p>二·長時間作縝密的空中偵察，以決定明確的最初目標，及附近最適宜有用的降落地點。</p>
<p>三·從高空轟炸設防區域及陣地，如港口和飛機塲。</p>
<p>四·以司吐加急降轟炸機進玫。</p>
<p>五·殲滅機掃蕩敵方空軍；殲滅機是一種長距離的戰鬥機或驅逐機。</p>
<p>六·降落傘部隊開始由空中進攻，最初僅用手槍和手溜彈，在克里特戰役中，士兵都在胸前備帶第二頂應急的降落傘。</p>
<p>七·載傘兵的飛機，兜了一個圈子後，仍飛臨戰塲上空，事實上，只要能够維持機隊的整齊交通，這圈子兜得愈速愈妙，但同時當然還要竭力閃避敵方的高射砲火。在第二次飛過陣地的時候，機內人員拋下了傘兵的別種裝備，主要的是每人一支步槍並一二挺機關槍。機關槍係一種特別式樣，用輕的錳合金製成，分三部份拋下，可以迅捷的合起來施用，步槍都巳實彈，裝在一隻有襯墊的長金屬盒內，並附有一偭包着橡皮的軸輪，以便在地上推動，滾到需用的地方去。有些東西繋在一種三連降落傘上拋下，這傘的各部分自然要比傘兵所用的獨頂傘小得多。各種不同的東西就以傘的顏色來辨別；偽裝的塗色法僅在士兵的傘上小規模的試騐過。</p>

<p>— 金毅</p>
<p>在接到孩子們的成績報吿單後，又是一個靑天霹靂，下的數字變得太快了。一個初級三年的小學生，其數巳超過我們讀中學的時代了。果然培植子弟，是做父母的責任，不過到了，吃飯」也成問題的時候，也不能履行「良田千畝，不如薄技在身」的遺訓，而做「不是爸爸」了！</p>
<p>教師的淸苦，與乎學校的開支增加，酌加學費自然是最後的途徑，然而「孤島學店」在這幾年來學費的一加再加，共比例不下於二房東之於三房客，做父母的人還在節衣縮食凑出這一筆錢送他們的子弟入學者，實在是不願意自巳的孩子把光陰浪費在打菱角「造屋子」上面，而貽害他們的將來。即以像我這樣每月尚能領到一筆固定的薪水來說，爲了籌劉「六個月」付出一次的學費，也是「不可說」了。</p>
<p>所以，現在已不是「呼籲」，而是「哀求」了，爲了孩子，也是救救做父母的人，在加學費的算盤珠上希望儘量减到最低限度，身負「教育」之重任的學校當局眞「忍令兒輩作頑童」嗎！</p>

<p>五音戲爲山東之地方戲，因其戲包括雙連環，九連環，娃娃腔，鬥寒蟲，雞拴五種音調，故名。又稱五人戲，或謂由於生，旦，淨，末，丑五種角色而起；或謂山東人讀「人」「音」兩字不分，故人實爲音之聲誤。土人則又稱爲肘骨子，似爲「秧歌」兩字之轉音。其戲相傳發源於淸時章邱歷城間之農村中，山秧歌演變而來。漸後流入都市，上自王公官府，下至士庶庭院，莫不有其蹤跡。劇本多爲才子佳人之故事，而絕少帝王將相之偉蹟。如樊江關，祝英台，王二姐思夫等，皆能迎合大衆之心理，故山東人有「栓老婆的橛子」之稱，謂其受婦人歡迎，一如門橛之栓合者，實則不僅婦人爲然也。正戲之外，又有粉戲，則較爲淫積，如桃花庵之類，今巳漸加改良。唱時無絲絃伴奏，僅用鑼鈸鼓板。唱至未句，例有拖長尾聲，而鑼鼓亦必　　槍以接之。其戲分東西兩路，東路屬歷城，注重於唱；西路屬章邱，則注重於演云。</p>
<h3 id="c48">「限電」一個建議 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>爲節减所存燃料的消費起見，法商電燈公司巳於去年十二月十日起實施限制用電的辦法。雖然上海電力公司也於同月二十三日經工部局核准通告限制用電，削减用電量，但是對於每月用電在五百度以下的用戶，仍舊准許用電五百度爲限。</p>
<p>法租界的限制用電辦法就比較嚴厲，他的內容是從這天起各用戶的用電量應該核减爲「平均參考用電數」的百分之八十。所謂「平均參考用電數」就是過去十二月間用電最多的四個月用電量的平均數，假使超過了這個平均數的百分之八十，就得遭受二十五倍收費的處罰。按照現在每度六角二分的價格計算，那麽超過一度，就得支付十五元五角的節金。</p>
<p>我們爲應付避免被處罰起見，也是儘量的節减用電，不過我覺得一般用戶對於過去十二月用電數量的紀錄往往殘缺不全，所以平均數計算起來一定感覺非常困難，因此作者主張法電當局應該把每一用戶可能用電的限度專函通知，同時在每月的帳單上用紅字把它特別標明出來，使得每一用戶知道「平均參考用電數」的百分之八十究竟是多少。那麼限制用電辦法固然可以順利推行，而一般用戶也可以避免無謂的處罰。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Fierce Battle in the Muar River Basin: Australian Troops Arrive in Northern Johor as Reinforcements <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Singapore, February 22nd (Reuters) – According to war correspondents for Australian newspapers, two divisions of the Australian army are again engaged in fierce battles with Japanese troops in the Muar River basin in southern Malaya. One correspondent, after interviewing Australian military commander Major General Bennett, gained the impression that Major General Bennett remained very calm and confident about the war situation. The situation on the coast is expected to improve. Separately, according to a correspondent for the Australian Associated Press, Australian troops have moved to the right flank of British forces in the Muar River basin in northern Johor to block Japanese invading forces, now only a few miles from the Muar River.</p>
<p>Singapore, February 21st (Havas) – The British General Headquarters has just issued a war report stating that fierce battles are currently taking place in northwestern Johor and along the eastern coast of the Malay Peninsula. In the east, British forces are heavily outnumbered by the Japanese. Our troops have abandoned Endau and are deploying new positions in the south. On the northwestern front, fighting is taking place in the Bukit Kepong area. The Japanese air force is extremely active and is using machine guns to strafe British troops moving to the front lines. British fighter planes are assisting the army in combat and encountered a squadron of Type 97 Japanese aircraft. Contact has already occurred in the Parit Sulong area. Mersing was bombed again by Japanese aircraft yesterday. In addition, more than ninety Japanese aircraft bombed Singapore yesterday, according to investigations.</p>
<p>Tokyo, February 22nd (Domei) – According to a dispatch from an Asahi Shimbun war correspondent in Malaya, Australian reinforcements arrived at the Malayan front on the 16th of this month on five transport ships. At the same time, a large number of fighter planes arrived in Singapore, and fresh national strength has also arrived.</p>
<p>Saigon, February 22nd (Haitong News Agency) – An Australian military correspondent on the Malayan front reports that the current fighting in western Malaysia can be described as a battle for roads. The Japanese army’s flanking maneuvers in the Muar-Batu Pahat area are attempts to seize the highways. If the Japanese army achieves its objectives, the highway across the central region to Mersing will be controlled by the Japanese. The Japanese army is increasing pressure at various points, and the defending forces are resisting fiercely. Few details of the fighting in the area are being revealed. A portion of the Japanese army has infiltrated behind the main battle lines, cutting down trees to block roads and obstruct British troop withdrawals.</p>
<p>Tokyo, February 22nd (Haitong News Agency) – According to announcements here, when Japanese aircraft bombed Singapore, they shot down seven British planes. When Singapore was attacked, many buildings and military targets in the city were hit by bombs.</p>
<p>Bangkok, February 22nd (Haitong News Agency) – According to a report from a Tokyo Asahi Shimbun correspondent on the front lines, the British troops surrounded in southern Johor have been attacked by the Japanese army. British troops in Segamat and Batu Pahat have surrendered separately. Currently, about 20,000 British, Australian, and Indian troops are still resisting fiercely. After this enemy force is defeated, Singapore can be attacked directly. According to announcements from Yangon, British troops in the Tenasserim Province of Burma are still retreating in order to concentrate their defenses. The province's terrain is long and narrow, making it easy to attack and difficult to defend, so British troops have no choice but to retreat quickly. The British are reporting very little war news from Malaya.</p>
<p>Observers believe that the situation in Singapore has become critical, so the British military authorities do not want to release much information. The Japanese air raid on Singapore on Tuesday was very intense, and much military equipment was destroyed. After the Japanese army invaded Burma, Thai troops also crossed into Burma east of Myawaddy, and fighting is now taking place north of that city. People in Singapore believe that the Japanese army is now preparing to attack Sabang Island at the northern tip of Sumatra in order to encircle Singapore.</p>
<p>Sydney, February 22nd (Reuters) – A dispatch from a special Australian correspondent accompanying troops on the Malayan front states that the British army commanders at the front yesterday reached a decision that will have a major impact on the fighting in northern Johor. British commanders held talks under the gaze of Japanese bombers. The discussions concerned the serious fighting in the Muar River and Batu Pahat areas on the west coast (70 to 100 miles from Singapore). The positions south of the Muar River are now the most important point in all of Malaya. Australian army commander General Bennett has indicated that he is concerned about the left flank of the Australian troops engaged in fierce fighting in that area. Bennett also provided reporters with details of the current situation in the northern and western war zones.</p>
<p>First Batch of Chinese Troops Arrives in Burma, Japanese Advance on Moulmein</p>
<p>Saigon, February 21st (Domei) – According to reliable sources in Yangon, the first batch of Chinese troops has arrived in Burma and is under the command of the British military authorities.</p>
<p>Yangon, February 22nd (Reuters) – After occupying Tavoy, the Japanese army launched another offensive yesterday, hoping to seize Moulmein. Fierce fighting is taking place east of that city.</p>
<p>Yangon, February 21st (Havas) – The British government issued an official communiqué today stating, "Heavy fighting is taking place in the Kyaikkami area, twenty miles south of Ye and forty miles east of Moulmein. Our troops are fighting bravely and relentlessly all day long. The battle is still ongoing. British aircraft have bombed the Mergui airfield, which has been occupied by the Japanese army, and have flown reconnaissance missions to the front lines."</p>
<p>Tokyo, February 22nd (Haitong News Agency) – According to the latest news from the Burmese front, after fierce fighting west of the border with British troops, the Japanese army routed 40,000 British troops, so the Japanese army has made progress in the Moulmein area. When Japanese aircraft raided the Moulmein airfield, two British aircraft were shot down in aerial combat and two more were destroyed on the ground.</p>
<p>Stockholm, February 21st (German News Agency) – A correspondent for "Svenska Dagbladet" in London reports that the siege of Singapore is imminent. In a few days, Japanese artillery fire will reach the city, so Singapore will soon no longer be a useful base for the British fleet. The correspondent pointed out that Japanese aircraft are now able to attack escort ships from Calcutta to India and Britain, and from the United States to Yangon. The British intention to enter Thailand from Burma in order to cut off Japanese communications between Japan and Malaya has now vanished. The current question is whether the British troops in Burma have the ability to resist the Japanese troops advancing into Burma. The correspondent concluded by saying that the fact that the British fleet did not intervene when the Japanese army landed along the coast of Malaya has caused great surprise in London.</p>
<p>Yangon, February 22nd (Reuters) – Japanese and Thai troops have launched new attacks on Burma across the Salween River in at least two or three places (the Salween River forms the border between Burma and Thailand in that area). It is reported that Thai troops are digging trenches and deploying in the Pa-an area (30 miles southeast of Myawaddy) and attacking the Kawkareik outpost. The Me Gaung River and Kalama River to the west of that area provide obstacles, but the Kawkareik area, which sits on a high mountain ridge, has good mountain passes.</p>
<p>Bangkok, February 21st (German News Agency) – According to Thai newspapers and uncensored radio news, the British are planning to move the capital of Burma from Yangon to Moulmein, because Yangon is not only suffering constant bombardment, but is also now under threat from land forces.</p>
<p>Tokyo, February 21st (Domei News Agency) – The Japanese army is advancing south along the entire Johor front, while British troops are continuing to retreat towards Singapore. Recent news from the battlefield reports that the Japanese army advancing in the central part of the Malay Peninsula crossed Labis last night. Another Japanese force is attacking Merlimau (nine miles south of Labis) in order to cut off the British army's retreat. The Japanese army crossing the Muar River southward is attacking the Japanese army about fourteen miles west of Yong Peng. Japanese aircraft again bombed Mersing on the east coast. Japanese aircraft are conducting extensive bombing raids in the Dutch East Indies. In the Philippines, the Japanese army has completely occupied Morong on the west coast of the Bataan Peninsula and is now advancing towards a certain location near the mouth of Manila Bay in order to cut off the American army's retreat.</p>
<p>Washington, February 22nd (Reuters) – The War Department announced that Japanese troops in the Philippines had launched another fierce attack on the American army's front lines on the Bataan Peninsula.</p>
<p>Correspondent Accompanying Troops on the Burmese Front, February 22nd (Domei News Agency) – The newly launched Burmese campaign continued today. The Japanese army invading from Thailand has now occupied one-third of Lower Burma. At the same time, the Japanese army invading southern Burma has occupied Myitta (on the Burmese border east of Tavoy). Fighting is occurring in various areas along the Burmese border, but the situation is unclear. However, there are reports of fierce fighting in an area east of Moulmein (about 120 miles from Yangon), but details are unknown. Japanese army aircraft again attacked Moulmein today, bombing the local aircraft hangar and freight trains.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Rumors that Dutch East Indies Army has Destroyed Oil Wells in Balikpapan, Some Resistance Still Reported in Minahasa <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Yangon, February 22nd (Haitong News Agency) – A dispatch from Surabaya states that the oil wells in Balikpapan on the east coast of Dutch Borneo have been destroyed by the Dutch East Indies army to prevent them from falling into Japanese hands, as rumors spread that the Japanese army is gradually approaching the city.</p>
<p>Saigon, February 22nd (Haitong News Agency) – Reports from Batavia state that concerned parties there commenting on the Pacific War situation say that six weeks have passed in an instant since the outbreak of war. Our experience allows for full formation. Military observers in Batavia analyzed yesterday's communiqué from the Dutch East Indies authorities, believing that the authorities have taken appropriate measures to protect the rich oil fields of Balikpapan from unexpected Japanese attacks. It is expected here that the Japanese army will attack the area sooner or later. If the Japanese army advances by land, the distance is too long and it will be difficult to achieve success. However, if they attack by sea, they will also encounter serious difficulties, as Balikpapan Bay is small and shallow, and even at high tide it is quite difficult for ships to navigate. However, it is not impossible for the Japanese army to attempt to seize the area, as past experience has shown that the Japanese army can accomplish things that were previously considered impossible.</p>
<p>Bangkok, February 21st (Haitong News Agency) – According to news from a Batavia correspondent, military circles in Batavia have not yet received reports of the Japanese army completely occupying the Minahasa Peninsula in Celebes due to communication disruptions, and they believe that the defenders' resistance is still ongoing. Authorities in Batavia acknowledge that the Japanese army is in an advantageous position because its lines of communication are not under any threat. The main objective of the Dutch East Indies' defensive strategy is to buy time to implement its scorched earth policy, as in Tarakan, and to hold the line as long as possible. If the regular Dutch East Indies army is unable to resist in the future, the Dutch East Indies troops will wage guerrilla warfare against the Japanese army. The Japanese army's strategy in the Dutch East Indies can be seen in the battles of Tarakan and Celebes. Before the Japanese army landed, Japanese aircraft attacked military targets around the landing sites, dropping incendiary and explosive bombs, causing large fires, and strafing military targets with machine guns. After that, the Japanese fleet unloaded the landing troops and supplies, with aircraft and artillery providing cover. The main equipment of the Japanese army is artillery, light machine guns, hand grenades, and wireless radios used to direct bombing.</p>

<p>Shaoguan, February 21st – Acting Chairman Xu Shiying has been negotiating with Guangdong Chairman Li Han-hun in Shaoguan for several days and has drafted an outline of the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Relief Plan, which has been telegraphed to the central government for approval.</p>

The Overseas Chinese Relief Plan is divided into offices by administrative region, stationed in Huiyang, Taishan, etc., and work stations and escort teams are sent to pick up and drop off people along the way, with Longchuan and Qujiang as distribution centers for resettlement. Overseas Chinese students who were originally in the country have been issued a one-time relief fund and will continue to receive loans.</p>

Establish an international currency based on gold to promote and facilitate import and export trade. 3. Centralize the gold reserves of all countries in one place and ask Latin American countries to replace their currencies with a new international unit. 4. Formulate a common labor plan for the Western Hemisphere and form a civilian labor corps so that any country in the Americas that lacks workers can be assisted by this group. 5. The term of validity of this plan shall be until the end of the war. 6. All ships transporting Pan-American trade shall implement convoy measures. In addition, it is learned that this proposal will be presented to the conference by the U.S. representative Welles and implemented by the countries that support it, even if Argentina and Chile express dissent.</p>

<h3 id="e20">A Short History of the German Paratroopers (8) <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Now let's take a look at the methods used in paratrooper offensives, which is also interesting. In the war against the Soviet Union, there was no need to apply all of these techniques, because there was no ocean barrier, and it was not necessary to change the plane-tank offensive. However, if Germany really intended to invade England, it would have to apply a paratrooper offensive, with two important auxiliary aids: first, the covering fire of long-range coastal artillery across the English Channel, and second, a joint land and sea invasion across the sea.</p>
<p>Below is the entire process of a standardized paratrooper attack, which is being published for the first time in the world, but was already extensively implemented in the Battle of Crete. The entire process can be clearly divided into twelve steps, and it is usually stipulated that at least one important airfield must be occupied within one hour of the start of the battle, otherwise the entire operation will not be on schedule.</p>
<p>1. The supreme commander selects the target of the attack, and the air force staff conducts a detailed study of it and formulates a plan of attack.</p>
<p>2. Conduct lengthy and meticulous aerial reconnaissance to determine the specific initial target and the most suitable and useful landing sites nearby.</p>
<p>3. Bomb fortified areas and positions from high altitude, such as ports and airfields.</p>
<p>4. Attack with Stuka dive bombers.</p>
<p>5. Fighter planes sweep and eliminate the enemy air force; fighter planes are long-range fighters or destroyers.</p>
<p>6. Paratroop units begin the aerial attack, initially using only pistols and hand grenades. In the Battle of Crete, soldiers carried a second emergency parachute on their chests.</p>
<p>7. The planes carrying the paratroopers make a circle and fly over the battlefield again. In fact, the faster the circle is made, the better, as long as the formation of the air fleet can be maintained, but at the same time, efforts must be made to avoid enemy anti-aircraft fire. On the second pass over the position, the crew threw down other equipment for the paratroopers, mainly a rifle and one or two machine guns per person. The machine gun is a special type, made of light manganese alloy, and is thrown down in three parts, which can be quickly assembled for use. The rifles are all loaded and packed in a padded long metal box with a rubber-covered axle wheel to push them on the ground to where they are needed. Some things are tied to a three-parachute drop, and each part of this parachute is naturally much smaller than the single parachute used by the paratroopers. Different things are distinguished by the color of the parachute; camouflage painting has only been tried on a small scale on soldiers' parachutes.</p>

<h3 id="e21">Authorities Plan to Conduct a Census of All Concessions Starting Early Next Month <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>This Move is Necessary to Maintain Public Security and Allocate Supplies</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement and the French Municipal Council will begin conducting a census of all residents in the concessions starting early next month. Traditionally, the city's population is surveyed every five years. It was originally intended to start the survey last year, but it was abandoned due to excessive costs. This year's population survey in the International Settlement will be conducted by Municipal Council personnel, and the method will be more effective than in previous years. In the French Concession, this work will be carried out by the police department and the finance department. Before the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the city had a total of 3.8 million residents. Afterwards, Chinese refugees continued to enter the concessions, and the population reached 5 million by the time the Pacific War broke out. Tens of thousands of people have been persuaded or voluntarily returned to their hometowns. This survey is a necessary measure to maintain public security and allocate supplies. It is also reported that the French Concession has agreed with the 18th Post Office on Rue Massenet to dispatch 70 employees and mail carriers at that time to carry out the survey work.</p>

<p>Previously, for the purpose of regulating the silver and money industry, stabilizing finance, and enlivening the market, businesses were permitted to use inter-bank drafts. The total amount was set at 50 million yuan in national currency, managed by the Joint Reserve Committee of Banks, and a Joint Reserve Inspection Committee of Silver and Money Businesses was established to conduct monthly public inspections to ensure credibility. It has now been resolved by the joint meeting of silver and money businesses to complete the closure process by December 12th. The total amount of inter-bank drafts used by various businesses is 6,523,000 yuan in national currency. All outstanding drafts borrowed by various businesses must be cleared. The guarantees submitted by businesses for using drafts will be fully refunded. The two trade associations have already issued notices to member businesses to comply. The associations have sent special letters expressing gratitude to the Inspection Committee members Wu Yunzhai, Qin Runqing, Xu Ji, Huo Jinshi, and others.</p>

The four supplementary regulations are: complete prohibition of collecting tips in any form within the Public Concession; prohibition of selling unclean food; imposition of unprecedented penalties for certain types of traffic violations; and authorization for the Public Works Department to take strict action against the storage of dangerous goods, as the recent series of major fires in the city were caused by the storage of dangerous goods.</p>

<p>Mr. Lang, the secretary of the Consular Body, told reporters that the Body has given temporary approval to these four supplementary regulations. In other words, the consuls have orally expressed their approval to the Public Works Department for these measures.

<p>It is reported that some nightclub and dance hall owners in this city have issued a joint petition requesting the French Municipal Council and the Public Works Department to allow the entertainment venues to extend their business hours. The main reason for submitting the petition is the huge losses incurred due to early closing. The petition states that after the entertainment venues close early, tourists are unwilling to go to the entertainment venues for short-term enjoyment and prefer to stay at home. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities of the two concessions will postpone the closing time to 11:30 PM every night. They explained that the main reason for the current restriction on nightclub business hours is to avoid wasting electricity. If the closing time is allowed to be extended, each nightclub will strictly comply with the electricity consumption restrictions proposed by the electricity company. Private clubs in the French Concession also close at 10:00 PM every night because the French police notice treats private clubs the same as nightclubs and dance halls. As for private clubs in the Public Concession, there are currently no time restrictions, but this issue is also being considered by the Public Works Department.</p>

<p>Three West Youth Basketball matches were held last night. Division B's Huanan team, with a seven-game winning streak, clashed with Baofeng. Huanan surprisingly lost to Baofeng with a score of 28 to 37, causing a major upset. Huanan's chances of winning the group championship are now shaky, indirectly giving Tongren a chance to win the title. In another match, Lanbai B defeated French Army with a score of 44 to 39. In the final match, Division A's Lianxing met Giant again in the second round. In the first round, Lianxing suffered a narrow defeat to Zhonglianxing by one point. This time, the rematch was crucial for the championship, so both teams gave their all. Lianxing, eager to avenge their loss, showed extra effort. Giant, perhaps due to excessive psychological tension, performed worse than usual. After the game started, Lianxing had a smooth start and led by a wide margin of 12 to 2. Giant's attack, with Phunik and Smith both scoring, Lianxing also gained some points. At the end of the first half, Lianxing led with a score of 16 to 8. After the break, the game became more intense. Lianxing's Kong Guangyi and Qiang Linlai performed well, with Kong being particularly active. Chen Xuechong and Qu Xilin also scored many points. Giant was unable to catch up. In the end, Lianxing defeated Giant with a score of 38 to 25, avenging their previous loss. The Division A championship will depend on the last match between the two teams. Tonight at 6:20 PM, three more matches will be held in Divisions A and B. Division B: Shangxing vs. Yiguang, French Police vs. Yiguang. Division A: Fulian and Zhongyi will meet again for the second time. In the first match, Fulian narrowly won by one point.

<p>Cash slumped in the black market, turning from firm to weak. Cash firms intended to boost the price, but unfavorable speculation was difficult to dispel, and strong selling intentions in the financial sector caused the price to fall rapidly after briefly breaking through the 11,500 yuan level twice. Sentiment was generally weak. The initial opening price this morning was as high as 190 yuan per tael (ten liang). Tianyuan sold ten taels to a certain silver building at a price of 11,150 yuan. Upon seeing Jinhong and other gold firms selling, the price immediately dropped by 200 yuan, falling to 10,850 yuan. Cash firms suddenly began buying, with Yongcheng, Wanfeng, Taikang, and Runyinlou competing to buy, causing the price to rise to 11,100 yuan. Money changers strongly sold hundreds of taels, further increasing selling intentions in the financial sector. At noon, the price fell further and was difficult to recover, dropping by 300 yuan. At noon, it fell to 10,800 yuan, with few trading houses. The price fell by another 160 yuan compared to the previous day, with a range of 350 yuan on the day. A total of 1,500 to 1,600 taels were traded. Jewelry gold was priced at 1,105 yuan per tael by Daxin and other firms (200 yuan discount on purchases). Silver was priced at 16 yuan, and the black market price fell to 11 yuan, with rumors of activity.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies were quiet. British gold pounds remained at 255 yuan, US gold pounds remained at 206 yuan, US dollar notes remained at 15 yuan and 56 jiao, Hong Kong notes at 2 yuan and 6 jiao, and military notes at 3 yuan and 9 jiao and 3.5 fen.</p>

<p>Government bond grey market prices continued to rise sharply yesterday, increasing by another 6 jiao to 1 yuan. The situation was more favorable than when trading officially opened, and it seemed that the closing price on December 6th was about to be surpassed. The market price of red tickets also rose from 75% to 80%. Type D bonds, which had the smallest increase the previous day, rose by 1 yuan to make up for the previous day's shortfall. Type C bonds opened at 66 yuan and 4 jiao, immediately rising by 3 jiao. Due to vigorous selling by Hengkang and Xinhua, the price fell back to 6 yuan and 9 jiao. However, with strong buying interest from Xingfeng, Tongyi, and Qianyi, the market still felt that demand exceeded supply, despite continued selling by Lianyi and Tongkang. The highest price traded was 66 yuan and 9 jiao, and the closing price was 6 yuan and 7 jiao. Type A bonds rose from 70 yuan to 71 yuan and 8 jiao, and the closing price was 1 yuan and 4 jiao.

The trend remained stable, and trading was not weak, with a total transaction volume of over 600,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the over-the-counter black market for stocks at the various industry guilds remained weak. The asking prices for various stocks have decreased.

<p>The rice market initially stabilized but then weakened. In the early morning, trading houses on this street had good demand, and the base price stabilized due to active trading. Subsequently, sluggish sales caused the price to fall. Early and late rice prices fell by 2, 3, or 4 yuan, with high-quality late rice at 198 yuan to 196 or 7 yuan, and early rice at 196 yuan and 5 jiao. Due to the small number of Northern Japonica rice arrivals, demand was better, and the market saw a unique stabilization. Special Kunshan Japonica rice was at 132 or 3 yuan, and general market rice was at 127 or 8 yuan. Yuan rice also saw active sales due to its affordable price. Jintan high-quality yuan was at 200 yuan to 199 yuan, similar to the previous market. The total transaction volume in the market was also estimated to be around 300 dan.</p>
<p>Edible oil prices continued to rise as trading houses on this street continued to buy due to delays in wholesale distribution until next week and the depletion of market supplies. Yesterday, 300 tins of Jiangbei raw oil were sold at a price of 420 yuan, an increase of another 10 yuan compared to before.</p>

<p>The spot market for cotton yarn remains closed, but off-market grey market conditions are trending upwards. This is due to the stability of gold, which has consolidated sentiment.

<p>Cigarette price increases have slowed down recently, as there are rumors of factory shipments and the possibility of price controls by the authorities. Furthermore, the market is flooded with miscellaneous brands, and people's purchasing power is decreasing, so prices are calm. Yesterday, Big British Brand was traded at 5,550 yuan per case, Old Knife Brand at 4,600 yuan, Pinhai Brand at 4,550 yuan, Little Fairy Brand at 3,500 yuan, Five China Brand at 3,500 yuan, Beautiful Brand (medium case) at 2,650 yuan, and Golden Mouse Brand at 1,670 yuan.</p>

<p>Due to no new arrivals, and after the Taiwanese groups bought up large quantities, the middle and lower quality goods were almost completely taken up, so the market situation is tightening. Currently, middle and upper grade goods are quoted at 220-230 yuan, and those who are higher than that are unwilling to sell for less than 250 yuan. Further tightening is expected.</p>

<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>After receiving my children's report cards, it was another bolt from the blue. The numbers have changed too quickly. A third-year primary school student's numbers have already exceeded those when we were in middle school. Indeed, cultivating children is the responsibility of parents, but when "eating" becomes a problem, we cannot fulfill the legacy of "a thousand acres of fertile land are not as good as a skill" and become "not a father"!</p>
<p>The poverty of teachers and the increase in school expenses mean that appropriately increasing tuition fees is naturally the last resort. However, in recent years, the "isolated island school" has increased tuition fees again and again, with a ratio no less than that of the second landlord to the third tenant. Parents are still pinching pennies to scrape together this sum of money to send their children to school, because they really do not want their children to waste their time playing water chestnuts and "building houses," which will harm their future. Even for someone like me who can still receive a fixed salary every month, it is "unspeakable" to raise Liu to pay the tuition fees that are paid once every "six months."</p>
<p>Therefore, now it is not "appealing" but "begging." For the sake of the children, and also to save the parents, it is hoped that the schools, which bear the heavy responsibility of "education," will reduce the numbers on the tuition fee abacus as much as possible. Do they really "bear to see their children behave like rogues"!</p>
<h3 id="e46">The Stage and the Screen <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>

<p>Rafael's "Home" has been staged and re-staged again and again, and the "Home" of the League of Nations has also been screened and re-screened again and again. From this, we can see the deep influence of Ba Jin's works among the people. According to reliable sources, after the screening of "Home" on the silver screen by Shanghai Guang, it will be shown on a large scale in the first-run domestic film theaters and the four major first-run Western film theaters under the jurisdiction of the Asia Cinema.</p>
<p>The Guangyu Society's "Young Heroes," Zhu Xiaoxiang, Lu Shiming, Lü Yian, Zhou Yunrui, Zhong Boying, etc., will jointly perform the "Book Opera" "Wen Suchen" on the evening of the 29th at the Oriental Theater. "Book Opera" is like the "Cosplay Shanghai Opera" of Shanghai beaches. In the 15th and 16th years of the Republic of China, the late Qian Youqing (a student of Xia Hesheng) and Wang Siquan and others jointly performed "A Penny Du Zhao" in the southern part of the New World, causing a sensation for a time. There will probably be some gimmicks on the day of the "Wen Suchen" performance.</p>
<p>Ying Yin's posthumous work "Flesh" may be re-released at the Grand Shanghai Theater.</p>
<p>According to reports from readers, Carole Lombard's last film was "Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith" co-starring with Robert Montgomery, which needs to be corrected urgently.</p>

<h3 id="e47">Shandong Five-Tone Opera <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— Ze Fu</p>
<p>Five-tone opera is a local opera of Shandong. It is named because its opera includes five tones: Shuanglianhuan (Double Linked Rings), Jiulianhuan (Nine Linked Rings), Wawaqiang (Baby Voice), Dou Hanchong (Fighting Cold Insects), and Ji Shuan (Chicken Tether). It is also known as Five-Person Opera, or said to be due to the five roles of Sheng (male lead), Dan (female lead), Jing (painted face male), Mo (elderly male), and Chou (clown); or it is said that Shandong people do not distinguish between the two words "ren" (person) and "yin" (tone), so ren is actually a mishearing of yin. Locals also call it Zhouguzi, which seems to be a transliteration of the two words "Yangge" (rural folk dance). According to legend, the opera originated in the rural areas between Zhangqiu and Licheng in Qing Dynasty and evolved from Shandong Yangge. Gradually, it flowed into the cities, and its traces could be found from royal families and government officials to scholars and commoners. The scripts are mostly stories of talented scholars and beautiful women, and there are very few great deeds of emperors and generals. Such as Fan Jiangguan, Zhu Yingtai, Wang Erjie's Husband Yearning, etc., all can cater to the psychology of the public, so Shandong people have the title of "stake for tethering a wife," saying that it is welcomed by women, just like the stake that tethers the door. In fact, it is not only women who think so. In addition to the main opera, there is also fen opera, which is more obscene, such as "Peach Blossom Nunnery", which has now been gradually improved. There is no accompaniment of stringed instruments when singing, only gongs, cymbals, drums and clappers are used. At the end of the song, there is usually a long drawn-out coda, and the gongs and drums must also [missing text] to connect with it. The opera is divided into two routes: the eastern route belongs to Licheng, focusing on singing; the western route belongs to Zhangqiu, focusing on performance.</p>
<h3 id="e48">A Suggestion Regarding "Power Restriction" <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>In order to reduce the consumption of remaining fuel, the French Power Company implemented a power restriction measure starting on December 10th of last year. Although the Shanghai Power Company also announced a power restriction and reduction of electricity consumption on the 23rd of the same month with the approval of the Public Works Bureau, users with monthly electricity consumption below 500 degrees are still allowed to use 500 degrees as the limit.</p>
<p>The power restriction measures in the French Concession are more stringent. Its content is that from this day on, each user's electricity consumption should be reduced to 80% of the "average reference electricity consumption." The so-called "average reference electricity consumption" is the average of the electricity consumption of the four months with the highest electricity consumption in the past twelve months. If it exceeds 80% of this average, it will be subject to a penalty of 25 times the fee. According to the current price of 6.2 cents per unit, then exceeding one unit will require payment of 15.5 yuan in penalty.</p>
<p>In order to avoid being penalized, we are also trying our best to reduce electricity consumption, but I think that the records of electricity consumption in the past twelve months are often incomplete for general users, so the calculation of the average will definitely feel very difficult. Therefore, the author advocates that the French Electric Authority should send a special letter to notify each user of the possible electricity consumption limit, and at the same time use red letters to specifically mark it on the monthly bill, so that each user knows what 80% of the "average reference electricity consumption" is. In this way, the power restriction measures can be successfully implemented, and general users can also avoid unnecessary penalties.</p>

<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Seventeen: Homecoming</p>
<p>"Uncle Han, my father vomited blood twice again today, and his fever hasn't gone down. I'm really worried to death!" On the morning of the third day, Mei Bao was worried because her father's condition had not improved after taking three doses of medicine, so she hurriedly discussed it with the old man Han.</p>
<p>But the old man Han himself was a villager who had just arrived in Shanghai, and he really didn't know which doctor to ask; later, he went to discuss it with the landlady of this small inn, and she introduced a Western doctor.</p>
<p>"But, Miss Mei Bao, inviting a foreign doctor means getting injections, which costs a lot of money, you must not be reluctant!" Before the doctor came, the landlady told Mei Bao very straightforwardly.</p>
<p>"As long as my father is cured, there's no reason to be reluctant to spend money?" Mei Bao replied without thinking.</p>
<p>However, after that foreign doctor in a suit, leather shoes, and gold-rimmed glasses came twice, Mei Bao felt that whether or not she was willing to spend money was one question, and where to get the money was another question.</p>
<p>When she handed the big doctor three ten-yuan bills for the second time, her hand trembled so badly that she couldn't control it.</p>
<p>"This is a lung disease, it won't be easy to cure in a day or two." The doctor put on a very arrogant attitude and said: "If you can afford to spend money, you should go to the hospital as soon as possible, if you can't..."</p>
<p>Although he was kind enough not to say the rest of the sentence outright, wouldn't Mei Bao, with her clever personality, understand what he meant? (312)</p>
