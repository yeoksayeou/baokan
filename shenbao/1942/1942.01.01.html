<p>小麥因貨主堅持扳守高價、致難接近、惟零星送廠者亦有點綴、麩皮迎日有內地鄉莊及本街各戶實銷問津、市面逐步起色、本麩雖經停車無貨、而日廠與客麩仍有趕到供應、昨有浦東鄕戶辦裝、市氣尤見活潑、蘭花麩巳自五十三元半開至五十四元、最高五十四元半、三金鐘麩正式售開五十六元半、全日成交不下一千五百包、價則又比前日較昂一元、</p>

<p>— 小曼</p>
<p>蛇先生仔細地把一年任上的擋案點檢淸楚，端端正正的　與走馬上任的馬先生。馬先生翻開一看，各種物價在這一年內無不上漲，囤戶均利市三倍，蛇先生也滿載而歸，不覺眼熱，向蛇先生莞爾曰：「儂倒着實有眼竄頭勢！」蛇曰：「馬兄，儂是跑馬廳內的熱　，奔騰之速，不見得會讓兄弟專美於前吧。」馬始而喜，繼又蹙額曰：「此一時彼一時也，老兄年底這筆爛汚賬，叫弟如何收拾？兄弟生不逢時，早不早，晚不晚，偏偏在這個孤島最不景氣的時候接任，各種日用品都有了限制，那裏去撈油水？」蛇代為謀曰：「孤島近來汽油缺乏，貴行馬車又當走運，目前馬匹正感無貨，出千元尙無購處，老兄正不妨操縱一下。」馬頓足曰：「快休提馬車，提起此事，實在令人可恨，背後拖着重負，走不快，跳不高，那裏能像老兄一年來的竄頭勢呢！」蛇曰：「這也祇能怪你命運不佳。不過我做了一年，怨聲載道，人民恨我刺骨，因為我竄得太快，一般人都給我丟在後面，所以你再也不能跑得快了；你要再像我那樣竄，俗語說：「狗急跳牆」，那時後患正不堪設想呢！」</p>

<p>— 寥霂</p>
<p>今天是元旦日。</p>
<p>新歲伊始，萬象更新，人們在世事變幻，歷盡滄桑中，又在生命史上開始了新的一頁。舊的過去，讓它過去罷；新的到來，懷着十分的欣喜迎接。歷史是前進的，決不倒退；人呢，也跟着時代前進。</p>
<p>我要向站在時代之前端者祝賀！喜從何來？竟有萬千之喜和幸福。這些，非要獻給為時代而努的勇敢者不可，他們不斷的爆力着生命之火，使生命無窮。在路上雖有荊棘，絆右，陷阱，躊躇，彷徨，但他們終會盡力去披割，斬開，投向幸福之路。</p>
<p>宇宙無窮，渺滄海之一粟，生命雖似有限，却要在時間上成長，額上永遠不覺絲毫之皺紋，眉間却始終洋溢着靑春之氣。——孟子所謂平旦之氣。這鐘靈秀氣可使天地澄淸，萬物向榮，人的生命那裏會與草木同朽呢？</p>
<p>我們要使每個人偉大，可興日月爭光。</p>
<p>易曰：「元者，善之長也。」又曰：「君子體仁，足以長人。」當茲新歲元旦之光臨，謹以此祝賀。</p>

<p>十六　靑春之火</p>
<p>「最好是讓我回去瞧瞧爸爸和哥哥，心裏也許會暢快起來。」有一次，她凑袁　藩曲意向她溫存的時候，提出了這一個請求來。</p>
<p>可是老袁畢竟不是個小孩子，怎麽肯放她走呢？他知道湘綺一離開他就會去找秋海棠，所謂探望父親和哥哥，祇是一個推托而巳。</p>
<p>「慢慢再商量吧！有機會咱們一塊兒去。」他這樣很乖巧的回答。</p>
<p>湘綺也就知道沒有希望了。她想除掉袁　藩能够死得比她早幾年以外，她這一生中間，休說不能再見到秋海棠父女，便是要探問到他們的下落，也不可能了。而老袁的身子是那樣的壯健啊？簡直像永遠不會死的樣子！</p>
<p>但命運所給她安排下的遭遇，倒還並不像她自己所懸想到的那樣的慘痛；過了三年幾個月，全中國突然發生了一番空前的劇變，固然有許多舊軍閥在被逐下野以後，照例很安閒地逃進租界去做寓公的，然而袁寶藩的運氣却特別的低，他部下有好幾師兵竟凑這一個政變中間叛亂起來，就在承德附近，跟他的親信部隊打了三天仗，竟把他自己的老命和紹文的性命一起送掉了。　（一一九三）</p>
<h3 id="c64">元旦試筆 <a href="#c64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— 董志</p>
<p>除夕一過，又是新年，一轉瞬間，陽春蒞臨，這正是勉勵人們要從刻苦修養中來造成個人前途幸福的象徵。當三十一年元旦的今日，謹以「人生修養」四字為獻歲中貢于讀者之前的禮物，可是人生修養的禮品，名目之多，勝于各大公司照耀眼簾的百貨，而「人生修養」，裝璜旣不考究，難免為顧客所忽略，筆者惟有掬此誠意，獻其一言，　求讀者之敎正。</p>
<p>今日的上海，生活程度如此高漲，各業都感到一般人購買力的低落，但是也有人坐擁鉅資；不事生產，要使大家的生活，能够平定，就必須公衆能够盡力協助。因此我想起劉向曾經說過：「有憂則恐愼敬事，敬事則必有善功，受爾則驕奢，驕奢則禍至。」正是痛切吿訴人們應如何的勤儉。孔子云：「奢則不孫，儉則固，與其不孫也寗固。」我想凡是境况較好的人，也應時時切念的。</p>
<p>元旦試筆，僅言修養，諸葛亮云：「靜以修身，儉以養德，非澹泊無以明志，非寗靜無以致遠。」以此名言，作為本文結論。</p>

In total, Japanese forces have occupied Singora, Kota Bharu, Victoria Hill, Pulau Pangkor, and Ipoh, among other places.</p>
<p>Malaya, 31st - Japanese forces in Malaya are advancing on the western coastal front, driving Australian troops into the low-lying wetlands of the ×× river basin south of Ipoh and surrounding them. A fierce attack has been launched since the morning of the 31st.</p>

<h3 id="e2">Philippine Battle Situation: Japanese Attempt to Encircle Manila from North and South <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Bangkok, 30th (Kaito News Agency) - General MacArthur's headquarters announced this afternoon that "the battle situation everywhere is quiet."</p>
<p>London, 31st (Havas News Agency, Reuters, Manila) - The U.S. Far East Command Headquarters issued a war report yesterday stating, "Japanese forces are advancing with a large number of tanks and armored vehicles. U.S. forces have been forced to retreat." A large number of U.S. troops have abandoned the defense of ××××. The two Japanese columns advancing on Manila from the south in recent days appear to be planning to converge at ××××× (50 kilometers from Manila). Although the direct distance between ××××× and Manila is only 50 kilometers, there is still a ×××× spanning 25 kilometers in width and 40 kilometers in length in between. Reuters reporters believe that the Japanese army intends to cross the ××× from the southwest to attack ×××××. Furthermore, observing the slight decrease in Japanese air force activity, it is generally believed that the Japanese side seems to want to allow the combat troops to rest slightly and wait for fresh troops and gasoline supplies before launching a new offensive.</p>
<p>Manila, 30th (Havas News Agency) - According to the latest frontline news, the Japanese forces that landed in northern Luzon last week have already reached ×××××××××××××× and ××××. The Japanese army is now preparing to establish contact between its various units in order to continue its advance.</p>
<p>Bangkok, 31st (Kaito News Agency) - According to the latest official reports from Manila, Japanese forces are currently advancing simultaneously from the north and south. Japanese bombers have been able to control all major transportation routes. The Japanese army is advancing with a large number of tanks and armored vehicles. The U.S. defense line is currently retreating. It is also learned that at 10:15 AM today, the sound of artillery fire was heard from the south to Manila, indicating that fierce fighting is taking place there.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 31st (Kaito News Agency) - A spokesman for the Japanese Imperial Headquarters Navy Department stated yesterday that the purpose of the Japanese military operations is "Asia for Asians," which also means "the Philippines for Filipinos." Destroying Manila is not what the Japanese army wants.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 31st (Domei News Agency) - U.S. Far East Commander General MacArthur declared today that the U.S. and Filipino forces should take retaliatory action against the Japanese air raids on Manila. However, this seems to have already been labeled as retaliation and merely expresses his personal hope.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Churchill's Speech: Future War Trends Can Be Divided into Three Main Stages <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Ottawa, 30th (Reuters) - (Chongqing Broadcast - A crowd gathered to welcome Prime Minister Churchill's arrival). A crowd gathered in front of the Canadian Parliament today. The Prime Minister arrived at the Parliament at 6:56 PM, and a thunderous cheer erupted. Canadian Prime Minister King and the Speaker of the House welcomed Churchill at the entrance of the parliament. The venue was packed, with approximately 2,000 people in attendance. Many members of parliament came from thousands of miles away. Churchill delivered a speech amidst applause from the members of parliament.</p>
<p>Ottawa, 30th (Havas News Agency) - British Prime Minister Churchill delivered a speech in the Canadian Federal House of Commons and Senate today, strongly asserting that the future war will generally be divided into three main stages. He said, "The first stage is the effort to unify operations. During this period, the most important thing to pay attention to is arduous combat. We must concentrate all our efforts to gain an advantage in both the sea and air. The main task of the second stage is to adjust efforts. We will see the Allied nations draft a general plan to use all their strength as much as possible for common interests. The third stage can be called the era of freedom. The people of all countries who have been enslaved will regain their freedom, and the conquered territories will be reorganized. The Canadian Federation has made great efforts in the current war. The British people are deeply grateful. The bravery of the Canadian army has been fully demonstrated in the battle of Hong Kong. Their combat record alongside the British army will be comparable to the Vimy Ridge battle in the last war. It must be known that by 1943, Britain will have the best pilots in the world. My purpose in coming to Washington this time to talk with President Roosevelt is to unify the command of the Allied operations. We can never accept any compromise. In short, looking to the future, it is still extremely dark. It is difficult to predict when the war will end at this moment. However, how it will be in the future depends on how hard the Allied nations work and how the war evolves, which is an irrefutable argument.</p>

He also advocated strengthening the British cabinet, purging the Munich elements in the government, and establishing a second battle line in Europe.</p>

<h3 id="e17">Gandhi Resigns as Chairman of the National Congress Due to Disagreement with Other Committee Members on Abandoning Passive Resistance; Rumors Suggest Nehru Will Succeed as Chairman of the National Congress <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Bardoli, India, 31st (Havas News Agency) - The Executive Committee of the National Congress met here yesterday. Chairman Gandhi had previously sent a letter to the Congress stating that as long as India's freedom is not achieved, the passive resistance movement (i.e., non-cooperation) that he advocated will not be suspended for a single day. Since this position is contrary to the opinions of most representatives, he has no choice but to resign automatically to make way for a more capable person. After the letter was presented and read out, the Executive Committee immediately passed a resolution approving Gandhi's resignation and supporting the assistance of Britain in the war. The main points are that "Although the current policy adopted by Britain towards India has not changed, this committee believes that the impact of the world situation on India at this moment cannot but be taken into account. Therefore, the Indian National Congress naturally sympathizes with those who are oppressed and those nations that are fighting for freedom. However, one point must still be stated, that only an independent and free India can plan its national defense from a national standpoint and serve the great cause of all democratic countries to overcome the various difficulties of the war period." According to Gandhi's letter to the National Congress, he first stated that when the Congress convened in Bombay on June 16 last year, he was publicly elected as the chairman. He thought at the time that the meaning of this resolution of the Congress was to express its refusal to participate in any war and to oppose all violent actions. Today, he realizes that his interpretation is contrary to the opinions of most representatives of the Congress. However, he has decided to continue to promote the non-cooperation movement, hoping to eventually implement anti-war advocacy and obtain freedom of speech with the support of comrades.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 31st (Kaito News Agency) - According to reports received here yesterday, Gandhi has resigned as the leader of the Indian Parliament. His resignation was the result of a meeting with other key members of the Congressional Party. After Gandhi's resignation, he ordered his followers to withdraw the implementation of his policies of non-war and disobedience. Because after the outbreak of the Pacific War, Gandhi requested the Congressional Party to restore the freedom movement, sources in the communication field stated that Nehru, a well-known anti-British leader, will succeed as the leader of the Indian Congressional Party.</p>

The Rice Office of the Public Works Department continued to issue transportation permits yesterday, specifying rice to be extracted from China, Mao Tai, and Roosevelt Warehouses, totaling nearly 20,000 bags. This is because the quantity issued is larger than usual due to the New Year holiday.</p>

Retail merchants are not allowed to charge more than 38 yuan in national currency per bag of Canadian flour (sold to small industrial users).

<p>Zhou Zhu, a woman from Dongting Mountain residing at No. 28, Lane 657, Tiantong Road, had a large quantity of lead type materials stored in her home, which was coveted by bandits. At 11:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, four people suddenly came to her, claiming to be from the Japanese Headquarters to investigate. They were local residents Ni Shuifu, Fang Fuqing, Wuxi resident Shen Nengquan, and Chen Bingquan, who is still at large.</p>
<p>Claiming that there were prohibited items stored in her home, Fang and Shen forcibly entered Ms. Zhou's bedroom and searched through boxes and chests without asking for any reason. They also forced her to open the silver dollar box. Ms. Zhou begged them in vain, saying that she had to pay 6,000 yuan to settle the matter, otherwise all the lead type materials would be taken to the headquarters and confiscated. Ms. Zhou had no choice but to invite her neighbor, Yuan Wendan from Ningbo, to her home to mediate.</p>
<p>Feigning Compliance</p>
<p>While reporting the incident by phone to the relevant Huisi Police Station, who dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to arrest them, Chen Bingquan was alert and escaped, while the remaining three people, Ni, Fang, and Shen, were arrested, along with Yuan Wendan from Ningbo (suspected of colluding with them), and taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the court, where the police station's lawyer, Li Zhishan, filed a public prosecution on charges of extortion under Article 3134, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Code, stating that the defendants took advantage of the situation to extort money from the woman.</p>
<p>Pretending to Extort</p>

<p>The New Year's Cup Little Football League, initiated by Wang Ruilong, invites four strong teams—Yiguang, Menghshi, Ruitang, and Shisheng—to compete for the title. It is scheduled to kick off today at 1:30 PM at the Guangxia Middle School football field on Muir Road. There will be two cup matches, with an additional performance match. Wang Ruilong will personally attend the opening ceremony and kick the first ball, with Han Langen and Yin Xiucen cutting the ribbon. The first match will be Shisheng versus Ruitang. The former was the runner-up in the Guangxia Cup's Group A for two consecutive years, boasting the "Iron Gate" Zheng Tongyu and famous forwards Song Weizhong and Liao Shiyi, possessing ample strength. Ruitang is a rising star, with an outstanding record and many brave generals under its command, such as Zhang Banglun, Hu Hanwen, Lin Dianhua, Cao Qinfang, and Zhang Zhaopeng, all top-tier players with a solid lineup, promising an intense and fierce battle with Shisheng. The first performance match will be Movie Stars versus Ruilong. The Movie Stars team has performed multiple times at the impoverished children's education center, earning high praise. Participating stars include Zhang Huichong, Liu Qiong, Wang Yin, Han Langen, and Yue Feng. Ruilong is the original Guangxia Middle School team, reorganized by Wang Ruilong, and has performed many times, demonstrating a high level of skill. Today's match with the Movie Stars team is considered evenly matched, making the outcome uncertain. The final cup match is Yiguang versus Menghshi. Yiguang has just won the Guangxia Cup's Group A championship, boasting top-notch players in Shanghai, such as Han Longhai, Zhao Yongfang, Shen Jinda, and Tao Tingfu, with high morale. Menghshi is also a formidable force in the small football world, and its players, including the famous general Xiao Ziwen, have participated in the football training classes initiated by Dai Linjing, resulting in rapid improvement in their skills, further enhanced by the support of He Jiatong and others, making them even stronger. The encounter between these two powerhouses promises a bloody battle. Tickets are priced at 5 jiao and 1 yuan. The schedule and lineups are listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e53">Foreign Rice Quiet, Domestic Rice Slightly More Replenished <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Small ground foreign rice saw quiet trading due to holders' intention to raise prices, leading to both sample showings and transactions being sluggish. However, domestic rice saw more replenishment before the Lunar New Year holiday, with purchases becoming more concentrated. The market also recovered from weakness. In the morning, following the previous day's weakness, the prices of various rice types saw another small decrease of 3-4 yuan. Subsequently, with more demand than supply, market prices immediately rebounded, ultimately not differing much from the previous market. However, there were many secondary retailers, causing a slight suppression. Kunshan Superior Japonica was sold at 220 yuan, Southern Late Rice at 208-204.5 yuan, Early Rice at 205-206 yuan, and Du Jian dropped to 190 yuan. Jintan High White Yuan was priced at 220-218 yuan, which, although nearly 10 yuan lower than the previous price, was still higher than the 210 yuan offered for entry the previous day. Total transactions for various rice types throughout the day exceeded 400 bags, while new arrivals were only over 220 bags. However, peddlers along the way still added some decoration.</p>
<p>Wheat was difficult to approach due to owners insisting on maintaining high prices, with only scattered deliveries to factories. Bran saw inquiries from both inland villages and local households, with the market gradually improving. Although local bran experienced a halt in transportation due to no goods, daily factory and customer bran still arrived to supply. Yesterday, households from Pudong were packing, making the market atmosphere particularly lively. Orchid Bran had already opened from 53.5 yuan to 54 yuan, reaching a maximum of 54.5 yuan. Three Gold Bell Bran officially opened at 56.5 yuan. Total transactions for the day did not fall below 1,500 bags, and prices were again 1 yuan higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>Grain trading was quite sparse yesterday, as peers were not particularly interested in entering and exiting the market due to the end of the year. Therefore, the market was bland and lacked momentum, with little change in prices. The overall market saw 20 barrels of Dalian soybean oil sold at 280 yuan, 200 dan of Dayou Factory Pure Oil at 248 yuan, over 100 bags of Chongming Red Sand at 90-92 yuan, 300 bags of Wuhu Corn at 51-52 yuan, 400 bags of Dutch Yellow Corn at 50.5-51.4 yuan, and 500 bags of Saigon New Corn at 52.5-53 yuan at the West Wharf and 51 yuan at the East Wharf. 500 pieces of Shengji Bean Cake were priced at 18 yuan. Also, the grain market will be closed for three days for the New Year holiday.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Cash Transactions Still Busy, Prices Have Risen for Five Consecutive Days <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Although yesterday was New Year's Eve, the cash cooked red and dark market transactions were very busy. The market remained stable and firm, hovering around the 13,000 yuan mark. A certain party sold a certain number to advance funds, and various parties were optimistic. From the early morning, the price rose by 50 yuan, reaching 12,900 yuan per tael (ten liang). Securities firms and a certain gold shop bought in, and retail investors followed suit, immediately pushing the price above 13,000 yuan, reaching 13,100 yuan. Cash shops and two certain gold shops sold off, and some sold actual goods for cash, causing the price to drop sharply by 600 yuan, falling to 12,500 yuan. After 10:30, it gradually recovered. A certain household and gold shop staff entered, pulling it up by 450 yuan, with the final price at 12,950 yuan at 11:30, fearing it would not be delivered on time. This was 100 yuan higher than the previous day, marking a five-day consecutive rise, totaling 3,450 yuan. Later, it was heard that transactions occurred at 13,000 yuan. There was a 600 yuan difference during the day, with 700-800 taels traded. The exchange price for gold jewelry at major stores such as Daxin remained unchanged at 1,350 yuan per liang (200 yuan discount for buybacks). Sterling silver was nominally listed at 16 yuan, while the black market was 11.5 yuan, 5 jiao lower.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Meal Ticket Market Conditions: US dollar tickets started at 18.2 yuan, then retreated to 17.9 yuan, and finally 18 yuan, with buyers still present. Hong Kong tickets rose to 3 yuan and 5 jiao. Military tickets were 3 yuan, 6 jiao, and 7 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Cotton Yarn Makes Daily Progress, Japanese Yarn Even Firmer, Cotton Has Been Inquired About <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Cotton yarn conditions continue to be good, with increasingly developed buying and selling. This is due to the stable trend of gold, so people's hearts are consolidated. As for the situation of Japanese yarn, it is even more bullish, because sales are not weak. Twenty-count Bianma Factory single opening prices are very stable, and they gradually move forward, breaking out of the 2,000 yuan mark to 2,035 yuan, but after closing, 2,040-2,050 yuan was offered for buying. The spot price of twenty-count Shuangma is 2,120 yuan. The "floor spot" price of twenty-count Tiannv is 2,380 yuan, and the factory price is 2,150 yuan. The twenty-count Shuangdiqiu factory price is 1,800-1,880 yuan, the twenty-count Lanfeng factory price is 2,430-2,450 yuan, the twenty-count Yueqin is 2,220-1,260 yuan, the forty-two count Lanfeng thread price is 3,850-3,950 yuan, sixteen-count Hongkuixing is 1,700-1,750 yuan, the ten-count Hongshuangma factory price is 1,400 yuan, and the ten-count Tongzijun factory price is 1,400 yuan. Currently, the yarn market is making daily progress.</p>
<p>The cotton market is showing increasingly better signs. Factories have begun to inquire, making purchasing possible.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Cotton Cloth Selling Prices Continue to Rise <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market continued to be firm, with peers trending upward and actively searching for spot goods, but transactions became scarcer due to holders maintaining high prices. As a result, the selling prices of various cloths rose by 1.5-3 yuan per bolt. Fugui Dapeng fine cloth was 84 yuan, Huadie coarse cloth was 102 yuan, eleven-pound Three Rabbit coarse cloth was 71 yuan, nine-pound Wufu coarse cloth was 61.5 yuan, Shilin cloth was 145 yuan, and blue cloth was around 110 yuan. Over 100 pieces were traded in the local market.</p>
<p>East Cloth: Yesterday, trading was active in the local market, and market prices continued to rise. The factory price for ten-pound Longtou fine cloth closed at noon at 86 yuan, another 1.5 yuan increase from the previous day. Mid-range varieties were particularly popular. Caiqiu Feiyu surged by 3.5 yuan per bolt, trading at 83.5 yuan. Yanghe fine cloth was 83 yuan, Laba was 81 yuan, and Sijunzi Shipu cloth soared to 157.5 yuan, with Xique Shilin at 156 yuan, all with transactions. Sijunzi Serge new orders were 3.05 yuan per yard, and old orders were 2.96 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Government Bonds Mostly Closed Out <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Government bond off-market trading was on its last day today. There was still a lot of trading. Most transactions were still the closing of transactions by various peers, as the bank's collection and liquidation situation was not relaxed. Therefore, government bond off-market trading was silent after 10:00. Grade A was from 60 yuan to 0.67 yuan. Grade C was 55.23 yuan to 0.78 yuan, Grade B was 56.7 yuan, Grade D was 52.5 yuan, and Grade E was 54.3 yuan. Transactions also amounted to more than 100,000 yuan. There is no formal announcement yet as to whether the red market will open.</p>
<p>Yesterday, outside shares of the Public Industry Association were slightly firmer. Jardine Matheson was bid at 70 yuan, Ewo Cotton Mill at 26-27 yuan, Planting at 21.5-22 yuan, Asia Dock at 8.2 yuan, China Textile at 9 yuan, Paper Industry at 6.12 yuan, and Lange Rubber was only sold when it reached 20 yuan. No other market prices were heard.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Coal Ball Supply Restored to Original State <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Retailers Adding 1 Yuan to Cartage: The coal ball market situation has seen various factories resume production one after another in recent weeks. Wholesale prices are still sold at 374 yuan, with supply and demand equal. It has returned to its original state. However, due to automobile restrictions, peers have stopped delivering goods, causing collapsing vehicles to be highly sought after, with very high prices. Depending on the distance, each ton ranges from 15 to 30 yuan. The cost of delivery to the store has reached over 390 yuan, and after removing the scattered coal dust, some stores add 1 yuan to the cartage per dan, hoping that the factory can understand this situation and appropriately reduce wholesale prices to facilitate sales.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Cigarettes Sell Well and Smoothly <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Cigarettes are scarce and sell smoothly. Trade prices are soaring, with various brands rising by over 100 yuan across the board, trading as follows: Great Britain brand at 3,950-4,000 yuan, Old Knife brand at 3,750 yuan, Pinhai brand at 3,380-3,400 yuan, Wuhua brand at 1,840 yuan, Little Fairy at 1,950 yuan, Golden Rat brand medium box at 1,470 yuan, Beauty brand medium box at 2,020 yuan, fifty-branch Great Three Cannon at 11,420 yuan per 10,000, and the price for a box of 200 Great South bullets is 47 yuan.</p>
<p>Daily necessities such as matches, candles, and soap are in short supply from the factories, with holders holding on tightly, causing prices to be firm across the board, as follows: Phoenix brand matches at 1,510 yuan, Beauty brand at 1,580 yuan, Bai Xiangmao soap at 71 yuan, Huang Xiangmao soap at 57 yuan, Gu Ben soap at 78 yuan, and sailing ship foreign candles at 53 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Snake and Horse Conversation <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— Xiaoman</p>
<p>Mr. Snake carefully checked the files for his year in office and neatly handed them over to Mr. Horse, who was taking office. Mr. Horse opened it and saw that all prices had risen during the year, and hoarders had tripled their profits. Mr. Snake was also richly rewarded, making him envious. He smiled at Mr. Snake and said, "You really have an eye for opportunity!" Mr. Snake said, "Brother Horse, you are a hotshot in the racetrack, and your speed is not necessarily less than mine." Mr. Horse was initially pleased, but then frowned and said, "This is one thing at one time and another at another. How can I clean up the mess you left at the end of the year? I was born at the wrong time, neither early nor late, but just when this isolated island is most depressed. There are restrictions on all kinds of daily necessities, so where can I make a profit?" Mr. Snake suggested, "There is a lack of gasoline on the island recently, and your horse-drawn carriages should be in demand. Currently, horses are also in short supply, and there is no place to buy them even for a thousand yuan. You might as well manipulate it." Mr. Horse stamped his foot and said, "Don't mention horse-drawn carriages. It's really hateful to mention this matter. Dragging a heavy burden behind me, I can't run fast or jump high. How can I be as successful as you have been this year!" Mr. Snake said, "This can only be blamed on your bad luck. However, after working for a year, I have been criticized a lot, and the people hate me to the bone because I窜 ran too fast, and most people have been left behind. So you can't run fast anymore; if you run like I did, as the saying goes, 'a cornered dog will jump over a wall,' then the consequences will be unimaginable!"</p>
<h3 id="e61">New Year's Message <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— Liao Mu</p>
<p>Today is New Year's Day.</p>
<p>The beginning of a new year, everything is new. Amidst the changing world and the vicissitudes of life, people begin a new chapter in their life history. Let the old pass; greet the new with great joy. History is advancing, never retreating; and people are also moving forward with the times.</p>
<p>I want to congratulate those who stand at the forefront of the times! Where does the joy come from? There is endless joy and happiness. These must be dedicated to the brave who strive for the times, constantly igniting the fire of life, making life infinite. Although there are thorns, stumbling blocks, and pitfalls on the road, hesitation, and wandering, they will eventually do their best to overcome them and head towards the road to happiness.</p>
<p>The universe is infinite, like a drop in the ocean; although life seems finite, it must grow in time, never feeling a single wrinkle on the forehead, but always exuding the spirit of youth between the eyebrows – what Mencius called the spirit of dawn. This aura can purify the heavens and the earth, and make all things thrive. How can human life decay with vegetation?</p>
<p>We want to make everyone great, comparable to the sun and the moon.</p>
<p>The Book of Changes says: "The first is the head of goodness." It also says: "The superior man embodies benevolence, which is sufficient to lead others." On the occasion of the new year, I offer this as a congratulation.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Begonia <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Sixteen Youthful Fire</p>
<p>"It would be best if I could go back and see my father and brother, which might make me feel better." Once, when Yuan Baofan tried to be affectionate with her, she made this request.</p>
<p>But Lao Yuan was not a child after all, so how could he let her go? He knew that once Xiangqi left him, she would go to find Begonia, and that visiting her father and brother was just an excuse.</p>
<p>"Let's discuss it slowly! We'll go together when we have the chance." He answered cleverly.</p>
<p>Xiangqi also knew that there was no hope. She thought that unless Yuan Baofan died a few years earlier than her, in her life, not to mention seeing Qiu Haitang and her daughter again, it would not even be possible to inquire about their whereabouts. And Lao Yuan's body was so strong? It was as if he would never die!</p>
<p>But the encounters that fate had arranged for her were not as painful as she had imagined; after three years and a few months, a sudden and unprecedented upheaval occurred throughout China. Although many old warlords, after being ousted and retiring, habitually fled peacefully into the concessions to become rentiers, Yuan Baofan's luck was particularly low. Several divisions of his troops rebelled in the midst of this coup, and fought his confidant troops near Chengde for three days, sending his own life and Shaowen's life together. (1193)</p>
<h3 id="e64">New Year's Try Writing <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— Dong Zhi</p>
<p>Once New Year's Eve is over, it is another new year. In the blink of an eye, the warm spring is approaching. This is precisely a symbol of encouraging people to create a happy personal future through hard work and self-cultivation. On this New Year's Day of the 31st year, I respectfully offer the four words "Life Self-Cultivation" as a New Year's gift to readers. However, the gifts of life self-cultivation are so numerous that they surpass the department stores that illuminate the eyes of major companies, and "Life Self-Cultivation" is not well-decorated, so it is inevitably overlooked by customers. The author can only offer this sincerity and dedicate a word, seeking the correction of readers.</p>
<p>In today's Shanghai, the cost of living is so high, and all industries feel the decline in general purchasing power, but there are also people who possess huge sums of money; not engaged in production, to make everyone's life able to be stable, the public must be able to assist as much as possible. Therefore, I remembered that Liu Xiang once said: "If there is worry, then there is fear, caution, and respect for things; if there is respect for things, then there must be good deeds; if you receive them, then there is pride and extravagance, and if there is pride and extravagance, then disaster will come." This is a painful warning to people on how to be diligent and thrifty. Confucius said: "Extravagance is not filial, thrift is solid, and it is better to be solid than not filial." I think that those who are in a better situation should also always be mindful.</p>
<p>Trying writing on New Year's Day, I only talk about self-cultivation. Zhuge Liang said: "Quietness to cultivate oneself, thrift to nourish virtue, without indifference there is no way to clarify ambition, without tranquility there is no way to achieve distance." Take this famous saying as the conclusion of this article.</p>
