<h3>阿刺伯的古與今（四）</h3>
<p>穆罕默德</p>
<p>從上邊所說的史事看來，七世紀後的阿刺伯歷史，實在應該歸功於一個人。這一個人，就是六世紀末，突然出世的回教始祖穆罕默德。我們不講阿刺伯民族則已，要講阿刺伯，就得講到這一位大人物的生平，教訓，及其事業。</p>
<p>阿刺伯民族的先知穆罕默德，於西元五七〇年，生於聖城麥加。他所屬的部落，就是那看守卡阿巴廟的祭師部落柯萊昔，照古代世界歷史的通例言，祭師是最高級的貴族。所以穆罕默德的出身，是高貴的，他幼年作牧年的童子，後來却做了隊高，趕着駝隊，來往於各城市，他生性好作宗教的默想，自此常常感到神靈敗示的憧憬。在這些靈感交通的憧僚中，神靈迦布列爾（Garbrlel）對他提出種種啟示，要他將這啟示，傳導給阿刺伯大衆。他開始這種宗教的生活，正當四十歲左右的時候。其時他已娶了妻子，過着富有安適的生活，然而他却要作精神生活的尋求（這凡是大宗教的創始人都是如此者，印度的喬答摩也是如此）他常常到沙漢中的小丘上，一個人去默念，一去就是二三十天不回家。吃飯睡覺，都在山上，在這個時候，他就以阿刺伯棗做食糧。他後來布教時，就是這樣生活簡單的。據說，他木來不識宇，也不能寫字，自經過靈感生活以後，他就能讀能寫了。</p>
<p>他經過一番靈感生活後，就自認是上帝阿拉的先知，傳達上帝的意志　他先向親屬朋友說教，漸漸地使他們信仰他所創造的新宗教。他這樣做了三年的工夫，却只能得到四十人作爲他的信徒。麥加城中大部分人，不但不相信他，而且詬罵他，痛恨他，迫書他，說他妖言惑衆。尤共柯萊昔部落，對他壓迫得利害。於是穆罕默德只好逃出麥加。其時是西元六百二十二年，回教徒稱之爲黑蚩拉節（Heglra）。這祭節回教徒看得非常軍要，回敎歷的年代，就是這一年算起的。</p>
<p>穆氏從麥加率了親屬信徒，向北逃到了麥地那，大受當地人民的崇拜。信徒一天一天地多起來，穆氏就做了麥地那城的立法者，大祭師，和軍帥了。他於是決心要回到麥加城，大宣教旨。就在黑蚩拉節後的一年的年終，他開始聖戰的工作。阿刺伯人紛粉集於他的旗幟之下。他們深信，爲了宗教而戰死，就可進入天堂到了西元六百三十年，麥加城就爲這些熱心的教徒所克服。即以麥加爲放射的中心點，穆氏的教義，向各部落宜傳開去。</p>
<p>穆氏於進入麥加後兩年，即西元六百三十二年死去。這時候阿刺伯各部落，都歸順他　。他是宗教的首長，行政的首長，也是軍隊的首長，他就在這兩年中率領了各部落，向各方發展，並由牛島而漸向北推</p>
<p>穆罕默德一生的思想默念，都包含在一部大書之中，其中有不少是在神靈啟示中所獲，後來由穆氏的朋友記錄下來。穆氏死後，就編輯成書。這一部大書，名日古蘭經，等於基督教的新舊約全書。他們最初所用記錄傳述的方法，或以記憶，或寫在陶片上，或寫在羊骨上，或寫在棕葉上倒是些頗爲有趣的故事。古蘭經中規定了四項德行或實任的履行。這四項德行，一是禱告，禱告者須面向麥加，每日舉行五次。二是施捨，三是每年齋戒一月，四是一生須朝禮麥加一次。在我們看來，朝禮麥加，最有意思這無異使一切的回教徙，不論屬於那一族，在精神上都認麥加是他們的故鄉，他們無形中自承是阿刺伯民族的一分子了。</p>
<p>此外，古關經所陳述的意義，叉有好幾點。一是絕對一神主義，大神名曰阿拉，這大神是全能·全智·全仁，全世界只有這一個大神，而穆氏是唯一的先知。二是靈魂永存不死，人生未來之生活，爲善者樂，爲惡者刑。而且生後之樂，仍能不脫口體身手之奉。三是着重道德，定有一種倫理的教條，頗似摩西十誠。對於仇人也主張寬恕，禁止飲酒，但允許多妻，允許蓄　。四是規定禱告的手續，禱告時須說「上帝唯先知唯一」的成語。餘則具如七節所述的情形。</p>
<p>按穆氏所創的宗教，原名伊斯蘭教，信此宗教的人，稱爲摩斯勒姆。伊斯蘭義云降服，摩斯勒姆義云降服者。向什麽人降服呢？向上帝的意志降服！</p>

<h3>考試的準備（二）</h3>
<p>— 胡祖蔭</p>
<p>考試前的準備</p>
<p>不論投老升學的學校或就業的機關，考試前的準備工作總是不可少的。許多人在老試時失敗了，就是因爲他們在老試前沒有充分的和適當的準備。考試的結果並不是代表一種僥倖的成功，而是一種眞證努力的表現。事前沒有充分準備，而希望老試時錄取，常然是幻想的。就是有了準備，而準備得不適當，也足影嚮老試的成功。現在提出考試前應有的三項準備，作爲投老者具體的參考。</p>
<p>明暸投老的科目和處所　在投考一個學校或一個機關以前，當然要知道所要考的科目是些什麼和這些科目要達到怎麼樣的程度，關於學校要老的科目，涌常可以函索或而索投老簡章，在簡章內當有許細的載明。假使所投老的學校楚大學，還可購買各大學入學試題一書，可作一種重要的參老。假如是投老就業的機關，可去索取投考須知，或看該機關在報紙卜所登載的廣告。各學校或各機關對終要老的科目注重亦有不回，例如甲校注軍英文，數學；乙校注軍國文，理科；某機關注重書法，簿記等。對於這些注重的科目，老應特別注意，準備。</p>
<p>關於投考的處所，亦應認識，熱悉。頂好投老者先到投考處所去一次，可以知道在什麽地方，乘坐那一種車子去，路上需要多少時間。到了處所以後，不妨參觀一下，注意問訊處，老室，飲水處，洗手處的地點以及附近有無吃食店。對於投老處所作了這樣一次的巡視之後，下次正式前往投老，定可感覺到非常的熟悉，因而可以增加許多便利和自信心</p>
<p>分配擊習優於密集學習　明瞭要考的科目和各科目注一重的程度以後，則應從事學科上的準備。許多靑年準備功課時，當是採取一種急時抱佛脚」的熊度，把各種要考的科目在投老前二三日拚命地强記。白日準備時間不够，就在免上「開夜車」。這種臨時用功的方法，固然可以稍有幫助；但是要靠此成功，恐怕是不可能的。</p>
<p>根據學習心理學的原則，在某種限度之內，分配學習常是優於密集學習，所謂分配學習，就是將要學習的材料，分配到若千次學習，每次學習的時間並不長，而次數則較多　。所謂密集學習，就是將要學習的材料密集在一次長時間內學習完畢。司塔齊DanielStarch會經做過一個試騐，他會請四組軍生用同樣的練習時數，和不同的時間分配去記憶生宇。各組所練習的總分數都是一百二十分鐘，但是時問的分配却不同，甲組每天練習二次，每次練習十分種，六天練習完畢。乙組每天練習一次，每次練習二十分鐘，六天練習完畢。丙組每次練習四十分鐘，每隔一天練習一次，三天練習完畢。丁組只練習一次，而這一次的時間則是百二十分種。結果，甲組的成績最好，乙組次之，丙組又次之，而丁組最壞。這也可以證明，在相當限度之內，每次學習的時間較短，次數較多，則學習的效率較高。所以「急難抱佛脚的學習，是不合學習心理學的原則的。投老者應及早準備所要老的科目，可使準備的時間充分，準備的次數增多，而學習的效率即可提高。</p>

<p>游藝界</p>
<h3>高天倫會談記</h3>
<p>— 心鵑</p>
<p>在娛樂界似乎稍露出一些萎頓的神氣的今日，高天倫（Gottlelein）的「木偶戲」的應運而生，不能不說是震驚沉寂的上海游藝事業的幸運兒。這種新鮮的玩意，給上海人以新奇的刺激和注意！猶太總會每天有許許多多高尙的人士，付出高貴的代價，帶着逸致的閒情，逍遙的神色，望着受人操縱的木偶發笑；這就是上海人愛吃「噱頭」的明證！</p>
<p>高天倫現在除了在猶太總會表演之外，並將自十三日（星期二）起在百樂門表演，每晚四塲：第一塲九時至九時另五分，第二塲九時四十五分至九時五十分，第三塲十時廿五分至十時三十分，第四塲十一時十五分至十一時二十分；星期六及日加一塲，自八時一刻至八時二十分，屆時百樂門勢將有一番轟動矣。</p>
<p>昨晚七時半高天倫到本館來，記者和他在會客室中作了半小時的談話，據他說：「這次在百樂門表演的木偶與劇本，都是以前所未曾演過的。我為了這次表演，也不知耗費我幾許心血。事先，我得籌劃一個故事，然後再製木偶，裝道具，配燈光；我費了三天三晚的工夫籌劃這次公演。添製新木偶十五個，費時二十五天，耗資六千元·，可見木偶戲也不是賣野人頭騙錢的玩意兒呢！」他談得很興奮，又不斷地做手勢，「這一次在百樂門表演　，有許多地方已經大大地改良了，利用優美的燈光，使觀衆一點看不出操縱木偶行動的五根提綫的存在。並且配合音樂，使木偶在台上唱歌說話，都像生人一樣，讓觀衆充分欣賞它美底價值！」</p>
<p>他說：「先生，我一天要做十四五小時的工作呢！從朝到晚沒有一些空工夫，我要寫宣傳稿，編劇本，製木偶，裝道具，什麼事都得一手句辦，不過自從我到上海來，——我在上海居住，到昨天剛一週年——還相當受社會人士的歡迎，這一點是很令我興奮的，同時也增加了我工作的勇氣，我想我以後更應當努力來迎合你們的美意」！</p>
<p>末了，他又吿訴我一些二</p>
<p>十年前在維也納擔仟導演的情形，他的面龐發着紅色，額上滲出涔涔的汗珠。「我在維也納導演的影片不下數百部。你知道幹電影工作是件苦事情，觀衆在銀幕下祇見很普通的說了聲好，那知我們已費盡了幾許心血；我導演過的片子很多，不過自問並沒有一部是粗製濫造，這一點我很足以安慰自已的！」</p>
<p>八點鐘左右高天倫起身走了，我們親熱地握着手，道聲：「再見」；這樣就結束了我們的談話；我的耳際還留着一個操着不純粹的英語的德籍猶太人底聲音！</p>
<h3>——木偶天堂——木偶戲的舞台面</h3>
<p>— 祖藝攝</p>
<h3>海上又添新劇院</h3>
<p>— 呂平</p>
<p>這是一個新消息，　煦路成都路西將有一座新戲院出現，院名是　華。</p>
<p>關於這座戲院，有兩個傳說：一說是女明星李麗華邀友合開，所以院名即定為麗華：又一說是梅蘭芳也有投資，所以戲院落成之日，梅闌芳早巳抵滬，即唱開幕戲亦未可知</p>
<p>昨據記者向有關係方而探問，知道上述兩說，不盡可靠。不</p>
<p>·麗華大戲院之正面·（孫樟設計）過該院是完全基於一座劇院建築的，所以邀請梅蘭芳登臺，很有可能。</p>
<h3>兩劇院之重要消息</h3>
<p>— 梅花館主</p>
<p>近來關於梨園的消息，非常沉悶，例如黃金的黃桂秋紀玉良，和更新的宋寳羅傳德威，大家都曉得是快要滿期了，但是下期的角色到底是誰，黃金和更新的當局，却守口如瓶，秘而不宜，因之戲迷同志，都不免着起急來，東探西問，定欲一知究竟以為快。昨日下午，有一個素未謀面的朋友，打電話到寒舍，向我探聽黃金和更新兩劇院的新角究屬是誰，並且還用恐嚇式的語調來激勵我，他說：「你於此道，消息最靈，此次關於兩院的新角，竟無一字發表出來，未免太使人失望了。」我聽完了他的電話，連說兩院的新角，我早已知道，明後日必定在申報上透露出來，不過戲局如政局，其中有無改動之處，我可不敢保險，閒文少叙，言歸正傳：</p>
<p>黃金黃桂秋等，准唱至十二日打住，下期新角，就是更新的舊角宋寳羅宋紫萍傳德威三人，原有底包，當然仍舊合作，不過俞振飛是否繼續出演，此刻尙在接洽之中，至於宋之登台日期，聞巳決定十五日夜塲更新方面，據說後局人馬，業巳擬定宋德珠王金璐二人，其餘配角如關德咸，王玉讓，殷金振，程玉煥，趙德新，于金驊等都是戲校的奮同學，合作起來，定有一番精采，現更新代表，已將各脚包銀開發淸楚，已於昨日起程南下，中途如無阻梗，明後即可抵滬，聞宋本人主張，登台之日，擬以「楊排風」「花貓戲翠屛」打泡云。</p>
<h3>藝壇風光</h3>
<p>— 心鵑</p>
<p>自榮偉公司解散以後，另有一CZC娛樂股份有限公司崛起，該公司之組織下包括有話劇，歌劇，木偶戲三種；據云演出地點大槪在金都大戲院。</p>
<p>紅寳劇塲之新人費華，為一極有希望之話劇演員，者番在「泣殘紅」曾有良好演出。</p>
<p>上藝之「第二夢」準演至十五日為止，十六日起上演「搖錢樹」。</p>
<p>李萍倩改編之舞臺劇「四姊妹」，決搬上銀幕，由龍秋霞飾大姊，陳琦飾二姊，沈浩飾三姊，陳娟娟飾四妹。</p>
<p>岳楓改編西片「芳華虛度」，邀高占非，陳燕燕分任男女主角。</p>
<p>馬徐維邦之「寒山夜雨」開拍以來，已完成三分之一。</p>
<p>陳燕燕劉瓊之「胡蝶夫人」在大光明開映期為一星期，自九日起至十五日止。</p>
<p>華夏業餘劇社近正積極排演于伶之「女子公寓」，導演為夏風與王即絮，定於本月十八，十九兩日假座辣斐劇塲作第四次公演。</p>
<p>薔薇處處開」中的主題歌，除襲秋霞主唱外，殷秀岑也參加合唱，殷胖自「王老五」後，　經好久不在銀幕上唱歌了。（按「鐵扇公主」中的「取經歌」並不出面的）凡愛好殷胖歌唱者，此次不可錯過機會。</p>
<p>在舞台上以演「家」「春」中的海兒給人認為「叫關有趣」的小鏗，在「春」影片中，也客串演海兒，此子生性聰慧，可奪當年童星黎鏗之席。</p>
<p>關於演員站崗事，會一度討論，事實果然無可避免，但是假使叫韓蘭根殷秀岑去站崗，不必拉鐵絲網，恐怕也要被「人的網」攔得路不通行了。</p>
<p>中秋開慕</p>
<p>該院是位在隔煦路四四四號，巳於上星期起全部　建。據該院設計師兼監　者孫　君稱。門面於本月內可竣工，內部至　股　七月底可完成·至於開幕期，則打算在中秋節之前。</p>
<p>該院計佔地十畝，雖不很大，却是依據英國Betler　Theatre建築冊最精巧的圖案設計。鬥面將用黑色人造石砌成，並有十二呎高度裸體女石像兩座，為義大利雕刻家尼魯最近作品。</p>
<p>新型裝置</p>
<p>穿堂較一般戲院為長，是為了適合於各種新穎裝置的緣故。院內共有二十吋寬度的沙發座椅五百座，並沒有樓。臺幕係用紫紅紫絨，舞臺面恰與蘭心大戲院相仿。臺後，有男女演員個別化妝間，包括冷熱水衛生設備，另外又闢更衣室休息室置景間等；豪前，另置五色幕燈。所謂五色幕燈，是隨時吿訴觀衆，臺上演劇到了燈幕，以及幕啟幕下的種種信號。以上各種設備，完全是合乎一座最理想的舞臺劇院的。</p>
<p>廢除陋習</p>
<p>因為有着兩個月的充分時間，各種工程，都很鄭重·由林大建築公司承包全部土木工程，一中公司承造鐵標。又據經理李前玉和副經理任玉田兩君說：這戲院破例設有一個美術商標，這美術商標，嘉禾是代表文化；面具是代表戲劇：雄獅是權威的意思。至於將來究竟上演舞臺劇抑平劇，李任兩君笑說，暫時恕不發表。</p>
<p>最後探悉，該院是在去年開始籌備，資金確定三百萬元。管理將絕對用科學方式，斷然廢除歷來相沿的惡習。更有一特色，即爲聘用的女服務員，將由某戲劇學校代為公開招考，因為希望女服務員，非但年輕貌美，溫柔體貼，而且能操流利國語並具有戲劇大才者，她們也可隨時受訓練登臺演劇</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（六）一彈指</p>
<p>接着下了三四天雨，葉氏家人都閒在人家裹。翠珍吿訴葉二太太道：一城弟的飯量，這兩天比以前少吃了半碗，不知道身體好不好。「葉二太太查間維城，維城道：「沒關係。」當下在世德堂大廳上，打了一段八段錦給葉二太太看。葉二太太笑道：「但願你身體好就好。」維城看葉二太太翠珍，都在做針線，阿興何子興等在絞草繩，雨天有雨天的工作·，自己呢，却有說不出的煩悶。忽然有人在外邊喚一聲「信哪！這一聲，聽在維城耳朶裹，特別尖銳，對大門口一望，一個郵差，穿了雨衣，全體都給雨水打濕了，在帆布袋裏掏出一封信來，阿興已在仲手接。可是維城在世德堂上，也不顧上邊的雨，也不顧下邊的濕，直越過中庭往大門口去接信。葉二太太嚷着地下滑，」翠珍嚷着「當心跌交」他都沒聽到。</p>
<p>不是什麼掛號信和快信，是一封平信。信映在維城眼簾裏，末一行是「上海陳緘。」他喜歡得了不得，捧到雙梅書屋裹，放在桌子上，急急忙忙找一樣東西，在桌面上找不到，在屜子裹也不到。翠珍在旁邊　哧一笑道：「是不是找這個？手裏送過去一把剪刀。維城道：「是的。」接了剪刀，把信鉸開。只寥寥數語：「維城：我失信於你了，很對不起。接着家母來論，知道你到過雙橋，更加對不起了。現在我不能回雙橋，也不能上花港，因為我聽從了同學的勸吿，利用暑期光陰，在學習看護，不管他有用沒用，學一些技能，總是好的。你在家裏很好吧？翠珍姊怎樣？家兄聽說他進了國語科練習國語，好多天沒見到了。你如果想我，對翠珍姊的臉多看上一眼，也是一樣的，我這語說得幽默嗎？下半年開了學，也許有見面的機會。芳。」　（一二五）</p>

<h3>Continued Warfare in Eastern Zhejiang: Japanese Forces Occupy Qingtian Yesterday, Advancing Southward on the Oujiang Military Highway</h3>
<p>The Allied News Agency reported from the Japanese army's base in Eastern Zhejiang on the 10th that the Japanese army, in close cooperation with its air force, launched a fierce attack on Qingtian at 2:00 AM today and captured it. Consequently, the military road between Lishui and a strategic location in southeastern Zhejiang Province has fallen into the hands of the Japanese army. The vanguard of the Japanese forces first advanced along the narrow road south of the Kuocang Mountains via the Oujiang River. After traveling 50 kilometers, they reached a plateau. Last night, they advanced further south of Chuanliao, intending to capture a strategic location in southeastern Zhejiang Province. Upon reaching Qingtian, they engaged with the defending forces of 500 to 600 soldiers and captured the city at 2:00 AM. Qingtian has thousands of civilian households, abundant agricultural products in the surrounding countryside, and is rich in copper, iron, zinc, and other minerals.</p>
<p>The Allied News Agency reported from the front lines in Zhejiang on the 10th that after occupying Qingtian this morning, the Japanese forces advanced rapidly. Before noon, they had reached 25 kilometers northwest of Wenzhou. The Japanese army occupied Qingtian at 2:00 AM. After completing the battle around Qingtian by 4:00 AM, they advanced south toward Wenzhou on the military highway along the Oujiang River.</p>
<p>The Allied News Agency reported from Shimen on the 9th that six hundred Chongqing troops attempted to sabotage the railway in Hubei Province but were repelled by the Japanese army near Baiyangdian.</p>
<h3>Establishment Ceremony of the Eastern Zhejiang Administrative Office; Shen Erqiao Takes Office Yesterday</h3>

<h3>White House Discusses Transportation Issues</h3>
<p>The Allied News Agency reported from the capital of Argentina on the 10th, citing a report from Washington, that US President Roosevelt met with US Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral King, British Naval Mission Chief to the US Admiral Cunningham, and US Lend-Lease Administrator Hopkins. It is reported that they discussed plans to protect transport ships carrying military supplies to the Soviet Union and other European theaters of war.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency reported from Washington on the 9th that President Roosevelt held an important meeting at the White House today with US Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral King, British Chief Naval Representative to the US Admiral Cunningham, and Civil Aid Law Administrator Hopkins to discuss issues such as merchant ship escort convoys transporting military supplies to the Soviet Union and other European battlefields. The reason is that Germany's recent attacks on transport ships carrying military supplies to the Soviet Union and American merchant ship escort convoys have intensified, causing significant losses to Britain and the United States. Remedial measures should be taken as soon as possible. In addition, President Roosevelt is scheduled to meet with the King of Greece, and it is expected that a joint declaration will be issued afterward. He also plans to meet with important figures from other European countries, including Belgian Prime Minister Pierlot of the London-based Belgian government.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency reported from Lisbon on the 10th that US aviation expert Major Sikorsky gave a radio speech yesterday opposing the establishment of a second front in Europe before the Allied air force can surpass the Axis powers' air force. This front would require at least one million troops. To transport them to Europe, 10 to 20 million tons of shipping space would be needed. If each ship has 5,000 tons, then 2,000 to 4,000 ships would be needed. This large fleet would have to gather near the battlefield and would become a target for German aircraft bombing before landing. This large army would take weeks to cross the ocean. If the Allied air force cannot control the skies, the landing would have no chance of success and would result in huge losses. It would also not help the battle on the Soviet Eastern Front. Therefore, the most effective way to aid the Soviet Union at present is to bomb Germany with bombers.</p>
<h3>Japanese Special Envoy Arrives in Bangkok Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Allied News Agency reported from Tokyo on the 10th that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced this afternoon that a delegation led by former Prime Minister Hirota left for Thailand on the 30th of last month to celebrate the Japan-Thailand alliance and is expected to arrive in Bangkok from Saigon today.</p>
<p>The Allied News Agency reported from Bangkok on the 10th that the Japanese special envoy, former Prime Minister Hirota, arrived in Thailand by plane with 17 entourage members for a return visit. They arrived safely at Don Muang Airport at 10:35 AM this morning. Thai Foreign Minister Phaholyothin, Japanese Ambassador to Thailand Tsubogami, and senior officials from both Japan and Thailand warmly welcomed them at the airport.

<h3>Brazil Temporarily Suspends Mobilization of Reserves</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency reported from the capital of Argentina on the 10th that it was recently reported that Brazil has decided to temporarily suspend the mobilization of its remaining reserves. The reason is unknown, but it is believed to be due to a lack of equipment. It is said that the Brazilian government had long requested the United States to supply an appropriate amount of armaments and equipment, but the United States has not yet fulfilled this request.</p>
<h3>US General Takes Over Trinidad</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency reported from Lisbon on the 10th that it has just been reported from Port of Spain that US Rear Admiral Oldendorf has arrived in British Trinidad to take over the US base there.</p>
<h3>British House of Commons to Hold Secret Debate on Shipping</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency reported from London on the 9th that Lord Privy Seal and Government Representative in the House of Commons Sir Cripps announced in the House of Commons today that the first two days of the next session of the House of Commons will discuss wartime production issues, and the third day will discuss shipping. At that time, the government will familiarize members with the shipping situation, merchant ship losses, and shipbuilding rates, but none of this information can be publicly announced.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency reported from the capital of Switzerland on the 9th that the Dan Daily reported from London that British Prime Minister Churchill and Under-Secretary of the Ministry of War Transport Lord Leathers, given the increasing losses of British and American merchant ships, plan to report on the Atlantic shipping situation at the next meeting of the House of Commons. According to a report from Geneva, London officials and semi-officials do not deny the severity of the maritime transport problem and admit that nearly 600 British and American merchant ships were sunk in the first half of this year, 340 of which were sunk off the coast of the Americas. It can be seen that the coast of the Americas is the most dangerous area. The reason is that the United States has not yet been able to plan for the prevention of submarines. There is no doubt that the Axis submarines have secret bases off the coast of the Americas.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency reported from the capital of Sweden on the 10th that a Swedish reporter in London reported that War Cabinet member Greenwood opposed the government's decision to secretly debate the issue of ship tonnage losses in the House of Commons yesterday, fearing that the public would therefore be unable to learn about the severity of the situation. Labour MPs Bevan and Shinwell expressed their support for his claim. The Lord Privy Seal Cripps, speaking on behalf of the government, replied that the British public should not in fact know about the construction of new ships, and we should also try to prevent the British people from having a partial understanding of the situation.</p>
<h3>Transformation of Indian Congress Party Policy: Majority of Party Members Advocate Gandhi's Freedom of Action</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency reported from Wardha on the 9th that the All-India National Congress Party Overnight Committee is rumored to request Mahatma Gandhi to serve as an Executive Committee member of the party. This is a major shift in the party's policy, and can also be seen as a result of the recent failed mission to India by British Lord Privy Seal Cripps. The majority of Congress Party members advocate granting Gandhi the right to free action. It is rumored that National Congress Party Chairman Nehru recently declared that Gandhi intends to support one of the passive resistance movements or other Indian independence movements. Gandhi himself also stated that the reason he opposes British expansion of power in India is mostly due to political reasons, not military reasons.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency reported from Madras on the 9th that, according to Reuters, former Madras Province Premier Rajagopalachari plans to resign from the All-India National Congress Party and the Madras Province Legislative Council so that he can concentrate on activities beneficial to the Muslim League. The reason is that he has always advocated dividing India into two parts, one for Muslims and one for Hindus, and advocated organizing a national government, but the All-India National Congress Party did not agree. If he engages in this work in the future, it is rumored that disciplinary measures will be taken against him.</p>

<p>Havas News Agency reported from Rome on the 10th that the General Command announced this morning that artillery battles occurred on the Egyptian front yesterday. A small number of enemy mechanized units attempted to break into the Axis army's rear, and several of them were damaged or annihilated.

<h3>German Forces in the Russo Area Launch Fierce Attacks on Soviet Positions in an Attempt to Force a Third Crossing of the Don River</h3>
<p>The Allied News Agency reported from Bear City on the 10th that the Don River front presents a new face today. The German armored forces, which the Soviets acknowledge have reached the Russo area (about 110 miles south of Voronezh on the Don River), are launching fierce attacks on Soviet positions in an attempt to open a third forced crossing of the Don River. German forces have already crossed the Don River in two places, Voronezh and another location. Therefore, the Soviets attach great importance to the developments in the Russo area, believing that the threat to the Soviet forces under General Timoshenko will intensify. With the German armored forces under General Bock occupying Russo, they can shift north and flank the Soviet forces near Voronezh. It is said that the Soviet defenses in this area are relatively weak, as General Timoshenko has been forced to withdraw troops from the southern area to reinforce the Soviet forces trying to block the German advance on the eastern bank of the Don River north of the city. The German attack originated from the vanguard positions they occupied near Kupiansk in late June.</p>
<p>The Allied News Agency reported from Moscow on the 10th that the Red Army newspaper Red Star reported today that the vanguard of the German forces under General Bock, after fierce fighting, entered Russo (110 miles south of Voronezh on the Moscow-Rostov railway). The Red Army has retreated to a new line of defense and is holding on tenaciously. The Germans are deploying large numbers of tanks and troops to attack and continue advancing eastward.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency reported from Berlin on the 10th that the German General Headquarters stated yesterday that German forces on the southern route of the Eastern Front continued to make progress in their multi-pronged attacks on Soviet lines on Wednesday. Clearing the remaining enemy fortifications is progressing smoothly. German aircraft provided strong support, often assisting advancing tanks and bombing the enemy's rear.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency reported from the capital of Sweden on the 9th that the Moscow Radio Station announced (1) that the Red Army is fiercely fighting west of Voronezh and around the Russo area today, (2) that there are no major changes in other areas, and (3) that the Soviet fleet sank two enemy cargo ships and one oil tanker in the Baltic Sea, totaling 22,000 tons.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency reported from the capital of Switzerland on the 9th that the New Zurich Daily recently carried a report from its Berlin correspondent stating that the rapid German advance towards the Don River is due to the German General Headquarters adopting a new strategy. The new strategy adopted by General Bock was first used by General Rommel in North Africa. The specific method is to send "a motorized column" as the vanguard, forming a square consisting of motorized infantry, artillery, anti-aircraft artillery, and engineering units, called a "Bock" (Pulk). When General Bock attacked the Oskol River and the Donets River, the assault team first occupied the position and then withdrew, clearing a road for the "Bock Team" to charge through, regardless of any resistance. At the same time, important troops were gathered from both sides to clear the remaining enemies. When they reached the Don River, the Bock Team used its infantry to cross the river and build a pontoon bridge, through which the motorized units passed and made contact with the retreating Soviet forces, thus ensuring victory. This strategy requires a large number of tanks and motorcycles, but its benefits are great. The "Bock Team" can change its direction of advance at any time, not only to the southeast, northwest, and all sides, but also can advance from the side. In addition, this "Bock Team" can also prevent the enemy's flank attacks at any time.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency reported from the capital of Sweden on the 9th that, according to Eastern Front news, the dangerous situation of the Red Army positions between Voronezh, Liski, and Kupiansk is constantly increasing. German armored units are advancing step by step east of Voronezh and have now reached the city of Yelsk. Another army has reached Bolochichovo and continues to advance south, but Voronezh is still in Red Army hands. The Red Army is currently launching local offensives in an attempt to relieve the danger on the right wing. In the Kupiansk area, the Red Army is also counterattacking and has recovered positions to Oskol. However, the railway center of Svatove and Starobilsk was recaptured by German forces last night after being lost in battle. The Red Army, under the name of Orel, seems to be concentrating its full strength to threaten the German flank. The Red Army has gathered troops there and claims to have recovered several villages. The Germans say they have surrounded the Red Army regiment south of the city and captured 20 tanks.</p>

<p>Bear City, 10th, Haitong News Agency: According to Swiss newspapers, Washington reports that the U.S. authorities are currently considering the establishment of a Commander-in-Chief for the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force. There is widespread dissatisfaction with the committee-led approach to warfare. It is said that General Marshall, the Chief of Staff, is the most favored candidate.

<p>Washington, 9th, Havas News Agency: Regarding the issue of the Allies opening a second front, well-informed sources here believe that a supreme commander may not be appointed until all landing preparations are in place.

<h3>Ancient and Modern Arabia (Part 4)</h3>
<p>Muhammad</p>
<p>From the historical events mentioned above, it is clear that the history of Arabia after the seventh century should be attributed to one person. This person is Muhammad, the founder of Islam, who suddenly emerged at the end of the sixth century. If we are not going to discuss the Arab nation, then it is fine, but if we are to discuss Arabia, we must discuss the life, teachings, and career of this great figure.</p>
<p>The Arab nation's prophet, Muhammad, was born in the holy city of Mecca in 570 AD. The tribe to which he belonged was the Quraish, the priestly tribe that guarded the Kaaba temple. According to the general practice of ancient world history, priests were the highest-ranking nobles. Therefore, Muhammad's background was noble. In his youth, he worked as a shepherd boy, but later he became a camel driver, traveling between cities. He was naturally inclined to religious contemplation and from then on often felt the yearning for divine revelation. In these moments of spiritual communion, the divine angel Gabriel (Garbrlel) presented him with various revelations, instructing him to transmit these revelations to the Arab masses. He began this religious life around the age of forty. At that time, he was already married and living a wealthy and comfortable life, but he still sought a spiritual life (as do all founders of great religions; Gautama Buddha of India was the same). He often went to the hills in the desert to meditate alone, staying away from home for twenty or thirty days at a time. He ate and slept on the mountain, and at this time, he used Arabian dates as his food. When he later preached, he lived in a simple way. It is said that he originally did not know how to read or write, but after experiencing spiritual life, he was able to read and write.</p>
<p>After experiencing a period of spiritual life, he proclaimed himself as the prophet of God Allah, conveying the will of God. He first preached to relatives and friends, gradually leading them to believe in the new religion he created. He did this for three years, but only managed to gain forty followers. The majority of the people in Mecca not only did not believe him but also reviled him, hated him, and persecuted him, saying that he was spreading false doctrines to confuse the masses. The Quraish tribe, in particular, oppressed him severely. Therefore, Muhammad had no choice but to flee Mecca. The time was 622 AD, which Muslims call the Hijra (Heglra). This festival is considered very important by Muslims, and the Muslim calendar is calculated from this year.</p>
<p>Muhammad led his relatives and followers north from Mecca to Medina, where he was greatly revered by the local people. The number of believers increased day by day, and Muhammad became the legislator, high priest, and military commander of Medina. He then decided to return to Mecca to proclaim his religious doctrines. At the end of the year after the Hijra, he began the work of holy war. Arabs flocked to his banner. They firmly believed that dying for religion would allow them to enter paradise. In 630 AD, Mecca was conquered by these zealous believers. Taking Mecca as the central point of radiation, Muhammad's doctrines spread to various tribes.</p>
<p>Muhammad died two years after entering Mecca, in 632 AD. By this time, all the Arab tribes had submitted to him. He was the head of religion, the head of administration, and also the head of the army. In these two years, he led the various tribes to develop in all directions, gradually pushing north from the island of Niu.</p>
<p>Muhammad's thoughts and meditations throughout his life are contained in a large book, much of which was obtained through divine revelation, and later recorded by Muhammad's friends. After Muhammad's death, it was compiled into a book. This great book is called the Quran, equivalent to the Old and New Testaments of Christianity. The methods they initially used to record and transmit it, either by memory or by writing on pottery shards, sheep bones, or palm leaves, are quite interesting stories. The Quran stipulates the fulfillment of four virtues or obligations. These four virtues are: first, prayer, in which the worshiper must face Mecca and perform five times daily; second, charity; third, fasting for one month each year; and fourth, making a pilgrimage to Mecca once in a lifetime. In our view, the pilgrimage to Mecca is the most meaningful. This is tantamount to making all Muslims, regardless of their ethnicity, recognize Mecca as their spiritual homeland, and they unconsciously acknowledge that they are members of the Arab nation.</p>
<p>In addition, the meaning stated in the Quran has several points. One is absolute monotheism, the great God is called Allah, this great God is omnipotent, omniscient, and all-benevolent, there is only this one great God in the whole world, and Muhammad is the only prophet. Second, the soul is immortal, the future life of man is happy for the good and punished for the evil. Moreover, the pleasure after life can still not escape the enjoyment of the mouth, body, hands, and feet. Third, emphasize morality, and set a kind of ethical creed, quite like the Ten Commandments of Moses. For enemies, they also advocate forgiveness, prohibit drinking alcohol, but allow multiple wives and concubines. Fourth, stipulate the procedures for prayer, and when praying, you must say the idiom "God is only the prophet is only". The rest are the same as the situation described in the seven sections.</p>
<p>The religion created by Muhammad was originally called Islam, and those who believe in this religion are called Muslims. Islam means submission, and Muslim means submitter. Who do you surrender to? Surrender to the will of God!</p>
<h3>Mecca Square</h3>
<p>Friends of Islam: This square is located in the center of the world. When religious friends make a pilgrimage to Mecca, they must first run around the square seven times, and then enter the white house and drink water from the holy well.</p>

It is now heard that in order to benefit the general depositors, the authorities have started the second repayment of deposits in accordance with the following methods from the 10th: (1) The repayment amount is 50% of the remaining amount after the first repayment (except for the amount paid from December 8th to May 27th); (2) The repayment date is from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM on July 10th; (3) The repayment location is the same as the first time; (4) Deposits of more than 5,000 yuan must have a certificate guaranteeing that they are not hostile; (5) The third repayment period will be announced separately.</p>

In addition, Banque Franco-Chinoise has also decided to start the third repayment of general deposits from the 13th, the ratio of which is 10% of the remaining amount after the first repayment. According to the bank, the total amount of the second and third repayments is 20%. Up to now, the repayment progress has not been very good, because of the bank's asset status.</p>
<h3>Mr. and Mrs. Tashiro of the Japanese Embassy Host Guests from All Walks of Life</h3>
<p>Mr. Hirota, the newly appointed Director of the Information Department of the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai, has taken office.

<h3>Old Auxiliary Currency Continues to Circulate; Central Reserve Bank Issues Additional One-Yuan Notes</h3>
<p>After the Central Reserve Bank Notes became the only currency in circulation, the old legal currency was rejected. Regarding the old auxiliary currency issued by the Central, China, and Communications Banks, it is allowed to circulate at half the price of the Central Reserve Bank Notes. However, the public has refused to accept these old auxiliary currency. Recently, large companies such as Sincere, Wing On, and the Shanghai Tram Company have been ordered to announce that the auxiliary currency of the Central, China, and Communications Banks below five jiao is allowed to be accepted and used at a rate of two to one against the Central Reserve Bank Notes. Therefore, the auxiliary currency of the three banks is now circulating at half the price of the Central Reserve Bank Notes and may not be arbitrarily rejected.</p>
<p>Issuing Green-Blue One-Yuan Notes</p>
<p>In order to meet the needs of the market and adjust the small denomination notes, the Central Reserve Bank has specially issued a green-blue one-yuan exchange note. The plate pattern is exactly the same as the already issued one-yuan green exchange note. The Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank has been instructed to issue this one-yuan single note for circulation in the market. At the same time, the branch has sent samples of the new notes to various banks and money shops for inspection.</p>
<p>Price-Equivalent Notes Limited; Today for Recall</p>
<p>Businesses, shops, restaurants, hotels, and entertainment venues had previously issued price-equivalent notes of one yuan and below in circulation due to the lack of one-yuan notes and auxiliary currency on the market. Now that one-yuan single notes have been issued and there are unlimited exchange auxiliary currency notes, the authorities have ordered the price-equivalent notes that have been issued to be recalled at face value before the 11th, and no goods may be exchanged. Today is the last day, and it is hoped that the note holders will quickly exchange them for cash from the original issuer to avoid losses.</p>

<h3>Licenses of Six Nightclubs in Western Shanghai Revoked; Must Sign an Agreement Before Being Allowed to Resume Business; Punishments Will Be Given for Exceeding Closing Hours</h3>
<p>The English-language Ta Mei Wan Pao reported that Mr. Pan Da, the Chief of Police of Western Shanghai, formally disclosed this morning (the 10th) that he has taken strict action against nightclubs in the Western District that are still operating after 11:00 PM, and the licenses of six of these nightclubs have been revoked.</p>
<p>Licenses of Six Nightclubs Revoked</p>
<p>The names of these six are Bolero, Roxy, Merry Widow, Eventall, All Baba, and Few Jaok's. The length of their closure will depend on the managers of the respective nightclubs. In order to deal fairly, he has instructed the managers of the six nightclubs to go to his office and sign an agreement, guaranteeing that they will close at 11:00 PM every night. If they sign this agreement, then he will allow them to resume business immediately; otherwise, they will continue to be closed. If any nightclub manager signs the agreement and the business still exceeds 11:00 PM, then it will be sealed and permanently forbidden from resuming business.</p>
<p>Strict Restrictions; No Flexibility</p>
<p>Currently, nightclubs in the Western District all close at 11:00 PM every night. Last night (the 9th), personnel were dispatched to patrol the district after 11:00 PM and saw that all the nightclubs were closed, with the exception of the Hungarian nightclub. The situation of this nightclub is slightly different from other nightclubs, because its lower level was indeed closed, but there were still gatherings upstairs. According to the manager, these were private gatherings, only allowing private guests to participate. He is still investigating this matter in detail, so no action has been taken yet. Mr. Pan concluded by saying that the restrictions on nightclubs in Western Shanghai closing at 11:00 PM will be strictly enforced in the future, and those who violate the regulations will be severely punished. Whether the operators are foreigners or not, they will be treated the same without any flexibility.</p>
<h3>Xin Puyu Hall Provides Relief to Orphans and Widows; Hopes for a Steady Stream of Donations from All Walks of Life</h3>
<p>Xin Puyu Hall has been tirelessly providing relief to widows, widowers, orphans, and the lonely for thirty years. Recently, due to the high cost of various items, the daily needs of the more than 1,000 people living in the hall have become increasingly burdensome. Fortunately, with the enthusiastic donations from all walks of life, it has been able to maintain its operations. Recently, a person with a heart for public welfare, under the name of an anonymous person, specially donated 25,000 yuan last month, and has also been donating 5,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank Notes every month starting this month, benefiting the poor and the cold, which is a great contribution. In addition, Xu Chengyu, Ding Shanggui, and others donate 500 yuan per month, Sheng Juchuan donates 100 yuan per month, Yuan Yuan Milk Company has been donating four pounds of milk every day for three years, and Lu Chuping provides free medical treatment, all providing great assistance to the hall. However, given the current living standards, the hall needs approximately 30,000 yuan per month for rice and grain, and approximately 20,000 yuan for firewood and miscellaneous expenses. Although it has received enthusiastic donations from the grain industry, it still feels that it is far from enough. It is deeply hoped that all walks of life will appreciate the hall's past achievements and continue to support it. The hall's donation collection points are as follows: (A) Donation Collection Point: Catholic Church, Tianzhu Tang Street, Yangjingbang, French Concession; (B) Donation Collection Point: (1) Silk Industry Bank Trust Department, 460 Hankou Road; (2) Jihuatang, 47 Yunnan Road; (3) Huamei Pharmacy, 356 Fuzhou Road; (4) Catholic Church, Tianzhu Tang Street, Yangjingbang, French Concession. After receiving the money and goods, the above locations will submit them to Xin Puyu Hall for public announcement at any time to show good faith.</p>
<h3>Don't Waste Your Little Brother's Candy Money, Donate It to Education</h3>
<p>Our newspaper's Third Reader Scholarship Fund is about to start accepting applications. Recently, we have received generous donations from enthusiastic individuals from all walks of life. Donations are pouring in, and the amount of funds is growing daily. Although it is still far from our goal of raising 100,000 yuan, judging from the current situation, we may soon reach our expected goal. Yesterday, Feng Shen Shanghai Branch generously donated 500 yuan, which is deeply gratifying. Mr. Li Fuyang generously donated 100 yuan, and little brother Xu Yuanjun, on his eighth birthday, saved 50 yuan from his candy money and sent a letter saying, "Dear writer at the Shen Bao, a few days ago, I heard my mom say that the Shen Bao is asking everyone to donate money for scholarships because tuition fees will increase next semester. I think not being able to study because of lack of money is a very painful thing. I am willing to donate the 50 yuan I received from my grandfather for my eighth birthday candy money. My mom also agrees. Now I am asking someone to send it over. Please accept it." Little brother Xu has shown compassion for the hungry and weak from a young age, and is helping poor students. He will surely achieve great things in the future. In addition, Zheng Shujuan specially donated the 20 yuan prize she received for graduating from elementary school at the top of her class to the scholarship fund. This kind of spirit is commendable. Yesterday, we received a total of 670 yuan in Central Bank notes. The previous balance was 49,993 yuan and 44 cents, bringing the total balance to 50,663 yuan and 44 cents.</p>
<h3>Preparing for Exams (II)</h3>
<p>— Hu Zuyin</p>
<p>Preparation Before Exams</p>
<p>Whether applying to a school for further education or a government agency for employment, preparation before the exam is always essential. Many people fail exams because they did not prepare sufficiently and appropriately beforehand. Exam results do not represent a lucky success, but a true manifestation of effort. It is often a fantasy to hope for admission without adequate preparation. Even with preparation, if it is inappropriate, it can also affect the success of the exam. Now, three key preparations that applicants should make are presented as concrete references.</p>
<p>Understand the Subjects and Location of the Exam  Before applying to a school or agency, it is crucial to know the subjects to be tested and the required level for each subject. For school exams, one can often request the application brochure by mail or in person, which should contain detailed information. If the school is a university, purchasing a book of past university entrance exam questions can serve as an important reference. For employment in a government agency, one can request application instructions or refer to advertisements published by the agency in newspapers. Different schools or agencies place emphasis on different subjects. For example, School A emphasizes English and Mathematics, while School B emphasizes Chinese and Science. Certain agencies may focus on calligraphy and bookkeeping. Applicants should pay special attention and prepare for these emphasized subjects.</p>
<p>The location of the exam should also be known and familiar. Ideally, applicants should visit the exam location beforehand to know its location, how to get there by transportation, and the travel time required. Upon arrival, it is helpful to explore the area, noting the locations of the information desk, exam rooms, drinking fountains, restrooms, and nearby restaurants. Such a preliminary visit to the exam location will create a sense of familiarity for the actual exam day, boosting convenience and confidence.</p>
<p>Distributed Practice is Better Than Cramming  After understanding the subjects to be tested and the emphasis placed on each subject, it is time to prepare academically. Many young people adopt a "last-minute cramming" approach when preparing for exams, frantically memorizing all the subjects to be tested in the two or three days before the exam. If they do not have enough time to prepare during the day, they "burn the midnight oil." While this temporary method of preparation can be somewhat helpful, relying on it for success is likely impossible.</p>
<p>According to the principles of learning psychology, within certain limits, distributed practice is often superior to massed practice. Distributed practice involves dividing the material to be learned into several study sessions, with each session being relatively short and frequent. Massed practice, on the other hand, involves learning the material in one long session. Daniel Starch conducted an experiment in which he asked four groups of students to memorize new characters using the same amount of practice time but with different time distributions. Each group practiced for a total of 120 minutes, but the time allocation varied. Group A practiced twice a day for ten minutes each time, completing the practice in six days. Group B practiced once a day for twenty minutes each time, completing the practice in six days. Group C practiced for forty minutes every other day, completing the practice in three days. Group D practiced only once for 120 minutes. The results showed that Group A performed the best, followed by Group B, Group C, and Group D in that order. This demonstrates that, within certain limits, shorter, more frequent study sessions are more effective. Therefore, "last-minute cramming" does not align with the principles of learning psychology. Exam takers should prepare for the subjects to be tested as early as possible, allowing for ample preparation time, more frequent practice sessions, and improved learning efficiency.</p>
<h3>Ms. Jin Yuzhen, the Protagonist of the "Yin" "Yu" Incident</h3>
<p>The "Yin" "Yu" incident, which had captured public attention and become a topic of conversation, was finally unveiled yesterday. "Yin" refers to Xu Maochang, and "Yu" refers to Ms. Jin Yuzhen, formerly known as the female storyteller Drunken Immortal. Yesterday, attorney Yu Xiangqin sent a letter stating that her conversation with a reporter from the Datong News Agency differed from what was reported in the newspaper. The letter is transcribed below: "To the editors of Shen Bao, Regarding the article "Unveiling the Mystery of Yin and Yu" published in your newspaper on June 10th, which mentioned that our lawyer announced the real names of both parties, please note that when the Datong News Agency reporter interviewed about the Yin and Yu incident, our lawyer only mentioned the reasons why our client, Ms. Jin Yuzhen, left Shanghai, and stated that we had previously responded to Mr. Yin's statements in the newspaper. We did not specify who Mr. Yin was. Therefore, the report in your newspaper does not match what our lawyer stated. We kindly request you to investigate and correct the record. Sincerely, to the Shen Bao Editorial Department."</p>
<h3>Samsing Cotton and Iron Factory Low Prices</h3>

<h3>No Mandatory Nature of French Concession Baojia Donation</h3>
<p>The Central Baojia Preparatory Committee of the French Concession held a meeting on the 6th of this month and decided to solicit Baojia funds from residents. Baojia chiefs in charge of each district are now conducting fundraising activities. According to estimates, Baojia expenses from June to December this year will total 1.22 million yuan, so it is hoped that this amount can be raised. However, according to the reporter's inquiries, this donation is not mandatory. According to the French authorities, "The expenses required for the organization and operation of Baojia can be covered by residents' donations." In addition to the new fee of 50 cents for applying for a residential identity card, residents do not need to pay any other taxes. Residents should only donate what they can afford. The rumor that Baojia chiefs will collect office expenses is unfounded.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Fellow Villagers Association Continues Scholarship</h3>
<p>The scholarship for underprivileged children organized by the Zhenjiang Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai has been very successful for a year, benefiting more than 300 students. Mr. Wu Yunzhai, the chairman of the association, held a tea party at the YMCA in Baxianqiao yesterday, inviting prominent fellow villagers, with about fifty people attending. Attendees made donations on the spot, with Wu Yunzhai donating 10,000 yuan, Lu Xiaodu donating 2,000 yuan annually and 2,000 yuan for Jing Gua, Pan Bingchen and Wu Shiqin each donating 5,000 yuan, Wu Limen and Ding Ruoxi each donating 3,000 yuan, Li Wenjie, Chen Yunzhong, Li Yunhou, Zhao Wenbo, Zhu Dongfu, Liu Yaofu, and Jiang Yaotang each donating 2,000 yuan, Wang Yuchou, Yao Hanbin, Jiang Furen, Zhu Guorui, Li Baosen, Hang Shuquan, Yang Zhizhi, Kang Bangding, Li Hongshou, Wang Chunde, Zhu Jinwen, Yao Huanbang, Jiao Qikuan, and Sun Shian each donating 1,000 yuan, and Zhou Daoqian, Xu Gaode, and Zhu Baoxia each donating 500 yuan, totaling 59,500 yuan. It is reported that the goal of the meeting was to raise 100,000 yuan, and there is still a long way to go to reach the goal. It is hoped that fellow villagers will continue to donate. The donation collection point of the association is accountant Li Hongshou at Lixin Accounting Firm, No. 406 Jiangxi Road. It is also reported that the third phase of the scholarship will start accepting applications around the 20th of this month. The association's address is No. 3 Zhifu Road, Zhejiang Road. All underprivileged children from Zhenjiang can apply.</p>

<p>The government bond market continued its downward trend yesterday, showing no signs of excitement. Although there were a significant number of purchases, they were mostly opportunistic buying to cover short positions. There was virtually no investment trading, giving the impression of an invisible summer slowdown. However, the trend of buying-side transactions was not completely quiet, which may indicate the sentiment of investors. If there is good news, the rebound will be rapid. Yesterday's trading started small, then increased, and then weakened again. Overall, it felt lackluster. As a result, prices continued to fall by one to six cents. The trading volume was approximately 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. A concise table is provided at the end.</p>
<h3>Oil and Sugar Payments Settle, Military Scrip Remains High</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association suddenly decreased by one point, to 15 cents. This indicates that the money supply is easing amidst the decline of speculation. It is said that there is no need to pay a premium to exchange checks for cash.</p>
<p>Military scrip is priced at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, and 6 li due to settlements for oil and sugar. Retail prices are quoted at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 4 fen, and 5 jiao, 8 fen.</p>
<h3>Gold Ornaments and Silver Ingots: A Steep Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of gold ornaments at the Da Xin and other gold shops in this city remained unchanged at 2,400 yuan per tael (with a reduction of 300 yuan or more for purchases). The interbank lending rate was lowered from 2,160 yuan per tael to 2,090 yuan. It rebounded slightly at noon to 2,115 yuan, due to a 50-yuan reduction. The market was pressured by sellers looking to unload physical goods. The price of silver ingots remained at 17 yuan per tael. The interbank lending rate declined sharply to 12 yuan, 5 jiao, and 6 fen.</p>
<h3>Flat Thick Serge: Unobtrusive Yet Popular</h3>
<p>Flat thick serge, with its thicker variety used for winter coats and its thinner variety used for uniforms, has been popular in the market for years due to its luster and durability. Factory goods do not have electric pressing machines, so there is no output. Also, because it is cheaper than coat serge, it is primarily manufactured by Poland. Currently, there is a shortage of this type of flat thick serge in the market. Since the end of the European war, no shipments have arrived. The limited old stock has been sold out, leading to a strong market sentiment recently. The price of ordinary thick flat serge is quoted at over 300 yuan per yard, while the price of thin flat serge is quoted at 160 to 170 yuan, or even 200 yuan per yard.</p>
<h3>Cloth Prices Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, cloth prices continued to decline. The closing price for new orders of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 195 yuan and 5 jiao, and the bank price was 169 yuan and 5 jiao. The price of Four Gentlemen drill red cloth fell to 7 yuan and 6 jiao. The price of 16-pound Earth Group cloth was 187 yuan, and the price of Feihong was 183 yuan. The price of 12-pound Earth fine cloth was 170 yuan, and the price of Dapeng was 164 yuan, all of which were two to three yuan lower than yesterday's prices. Longevity fu silk was quoted at 6 yuan and 3 jiao, and Changting was quoted at 6 yuan and 2 jiao, with limited transactions. Peach Blossom Lady Lin opened at 288 yuan and 5 jiao, and the final price was 282 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<h3>Soybean Cake Sales Increase Internally</h3>
<p>Internal sales of soybean cake went from weak to strong, so the market is relatively stable. Yesterday, 500 pieces of Kaili brand May new goods were priced at 57 yuan and 5 jiao, 200 pieces of May old goods were priced at 51 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen, 1,000 pieces of April new goods were priced at 54 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen to 55 yuan, and 800 pieces of Yoshida April and May new goods were priced at 57 yuan and 5 jiao to 58 yuan, and 500 pieces of June new goods were priced at 56 yuan.</p>
<h3>Wheat Bran Stock Low and Price High</h3>
<p>Wheat bran stocks are not abundant, and sales in rural areas are good, leading to a strong market. Yesterday, 1,000 small bags of Peony brand wheat bran from April were priced at 89 yuan, and 500 small bags of Sanxin wheat bran from April were priced at 90 yuan.</p>
<h3>Soybean Transactions: Scattered Rather Than Bulk</h3>
<p>There were slightly scattered soybean transactions yesterday, and the market was relatively stable. Eight bags of Chongming Sha Chi were priced at 165 yuan, 15 bags of Sha Chun old goods were priced at 114 yuan, and 20 bags of Tianjin tea beans were priced at 210 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Stocks Rise Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office sugar stock price was initially flat, then tightened, and slightly improved. The opening price for coarse sand stock was 316 yuan, the original price, then slightly rose to 316 yuan and 5 jiao, and the closing price was even higher at 317 yuan. The front and back prices rose one yuan. The trading volume was 500 bags. The buying and selling of red sand stocks were both lacking, and there were still no transactions.</p>
<h3>Industry Briefs</h3>
<p>Dried Sweet Potatoes Sell Slowly and Price Flat - Yesterday, the sales of dried sweet potatoes were not strong, and the price tended to be flat. Thirty bags of Jiangbei dried sweet potatoes were priced at 105 yuan.</p>
<p>Red Sorghum Floating and Sold Loosely - Red sorghum yesterday was slightly weak due to floating households selling loosely. Fifty bags of Mingguang red sorghum were priced at 106 yuan and 8 jiao.</p>
<p>Cigarette Selling Prices Rise and Fall - Because people see the price is too low and are unwilling to sell cheaply, yesterday the prices of brands such as Great Britain (8,000 per hundred yuan), Pinhai (4,700 yuan), and Wuhua (3,550 yuan) were stable. Old Knife (5,400 yuan) and Fairy (3,650 yuan) were lower by one hundred yuan compared to the previous day. The sales of Japanese cigarettes such as Jinqiang brand were strong, and the market rose, with the price increasing by 50 yuan to 1,356 yuan. Jin Dalou was priced at 2,000 yuan, Red Rose was priced at 2,200 yuan, Quanlu was priced at 1,680 yuan, Guide was priced at 1,200 yuan, and national cigarettes such as Meili (3,000 yuan), Golden Mouse (1,500 yuan), and Pyramid (2,800 yuan) were all stable.</p>
<p>Soap and Matches Absorbed on the Street - In the daily necessities market, the trend of soap is still stable, and matches were slightly absorbed on the street when the price was low. There were few transactions of candles, because they are included in the controlled transfer and are difficult to move. Most dealers have stopped selling, and the situation has become a market without sales. Yesterday's prices were as follows: Gu Ben soap, 330 yuan; Bai Xiangmao soap, 250 yuan; Scissors soap, 260 yuan; Huang Xiangmao soap, 200 yuan; Phoenix brand, 3,000 yuan; Meili brand, 3,100 yuan; miscellaneous brands, 2,200 yuan; Bai Lishi candles, 120 yuan; monk hats, 115 yuan.</p>
<p>Only Eastern Shark Fin is Available for Sale - Because the source of shark fin has been scarce for a long time, the market has little inventory. Only Japanese goods are slightly sold, such as top Wu fishing wings for 7,000 yuan, second for 5,000 yuan to 4,000 yuan, Wu sheep wings average 1,500 yuan to 1,000 yuan, Shang Zhuang 2,000 yuan, small Wu sheep wings 400 yuan, and the cheapest, small wings whole tail is 2,800 yuan, whole flag 1,200 yuan, and there are few other transactions.</p>
<p>Galangal Sparsely Arrived and Stored - Although sales have not been too smooth recently, but because the inventory is thin, the price is firm. The current market price for galangal is 65 yuan per catty, and for loose galangal is 45 yuan (commissions are added accordingly).</p>

<h3>A Conversation with Gao Tianlun</h3>
<p>— Xin Juan</p>
<p>In today's entertainment industry, which seems to be showing some signs of decline, the emergence of Gao Tianlun's "Puppet Show" can be said to be fortunate for Shanghai's entertainment industry. This fresh novelty has given Shanghai people a new kind of stimulation and attention! Every day, many distinguished people at the Jewish Club pay a high price, bring leisurely feelings, and look at the puppets being manipulated and laugh. This is clear evidence that Shanghai people love to eat "gimmicks"!</p>
<p>In addition to performing at the Jewish Club, Gao Tianlun will also perform at the Paramount starting on the 13th (Tuesday), four shows every night: the first show from 9:00 to 9:05, the second show from 9:45 to 9:50, the third show from 10:25 to 10:30, and the fourth show from 11:15 to 11:20. On Saturdays and Sundays, there is an additional show from 8:15 to 8:20. At that time, the Paramount will definitely create a sensation.</p>
<p>Gao Tianlun came to our office at 7:30 last night, and the reporter had a half-hour conversation with him in the reception room. According to him: "The puppets and scripts that will be performed at the Paramount this time have never been performed before. I don't know how much effort I've spent on this performance. Beforehand, I had to plan a story, then make puppets, install props, and match lighting. I spent three days and three nights planning this performance. I added 15 new puppets, which took 25 days and cost 6,000 yuan. It can be seen that puppet shows are not just a way to sell the heads of savages and make money!" He spoke very excitedly and gestured constantly. "Many aspects of this performance at the Paramount have been greatly improved. By using beautiful lighting, the audience cannot see the existence of the five control lines that manipulate the puppets' movements at all. And with the cooperation of music, the puppets sing and speak on stage like real people, allowing the audience to fully appreciate its aesthetic value!"</p>
<p>He said: "Sir, I have to work fourteen or fifteen hours a day! From morning to night, I don't have any free time. I have to write promotional articles, write scripts, make puppets, install props, and do everything myself. But since I came to Shanghai - I've been living in Shanghai for just one year as of yesterday - I've been quite popular with people in society, which makes me very excited. At the same time, it also increases my courage to work. I think I should work harder in the future to cater to your kindness!"</p>
<p>Finally, he also told me about his experiences as a director in Vienna twenty years ago. His face was red and his forehead was covered in sweat. "I have directed hundreds of films in Vienna. You know, working in film is a hard thing. The audience only sees the film and says 'good' very casually, but they don't know how much effort we have put in. I have directed many films, but I am confident that none of them were poorly made. This is very comforting to me!"</p>
<p>Gao Tianlun got up and left around eight o'clock. We shook hands warmly and said, "Goodbye." Thus, our conversation ended. The voice of a German-Jewish man speaking imperfect English still remained in my ears!</p>

<h3>A New Theater Added in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Lv Ping</p>
<p>This is new news. There will be a new theater appearing at Chengdu Road West on Xuhui Road. The name of the theater is Lihua.</p>
<p>Regarding this theater, there are two rumors: one is that the female star Li Lihua invited friends to open it together, so the name of the theater was set as Lihua; another is that Mei Lanfang also invested, so when the theater is completed, Mei Lanfang will have already arrived in Shanghai, and it is not impossible that he will sing the opening play.</p>
<p>According to the reporter's inquiries with relevant parties yesterday, the above two statements are not entirely reliable. However, the theater is completely based on a theater building, so it is very possible to invite Mei Lanfang to perform.</p>

<h3>Important News from Two Theaters</h3>
<p>— Plum Blossom Hall Master</p>
<p>Recently, the news regarding the opera scene has been quite dull. For example, everyone knows that Huang Guiqiu and Ji Yuliang of Huangjin (Golden Theater), and Song Baoluo and Chuan Dewei of Gengxin (Renewal Theater), are nearing the end of their contracts. However, the authorities at Huangjin and Gengxin are tight-lipped about who the next performers will be, keeping it a secret. Because of this, opera fans can't help but get anxious, inquiring here and there, eager to know the answer. Yesterday afternoon, a friend I had never met called my humble abode, inquiring about the new performers at the Huangjin and Gengxin theaters. He even used a threatening tone to urge me, saying, "You are the most informed about these matters. This time, not a single word has been revealed about the new performers at the two theaters, which is very disappointing." After listening to his call, I replied that I already knew about the new performers at the two theaters and would definitely reveal them in the Shen Bao in the next few days. However, like politics, there might be changes, so I can't guarantee anything. Enough with the idle talk, let's get down to business:</p>
<p>Huang Guiqiu and others at Huangjin are scheduled to perform until the 12th. The new performers for the next period are Song Baoluo, Song Ziping, and Chuan Dewei, the old performers from Gengxin. The original contracts remain in place, so they will naturally continue to collaborate. However, whether Yu Zhenfei will continue to perform is still under negotiation. As for the date of Song's performance, it is said to have been decided for the evening show on the 15th. On the Gengxin side, it is said that the next team has already been determined to be Song Dezhu and Wang Jinlu. The remaining supporting roles, such as Guan Dexian, Wang Yurang, Yin Jinzhen, Cheng Yuhuan, Zhao Dexin, and Yu Jinhua, are all classmates from the opera school. Their collaboration is sure to be exciting. The Gengxin representative has already cleared all the performers' fees and set off south yesterday. If there are no obstacles along the way, they should arrive in Shanghai in the next few days. It is said that Song himself plans to perform "Yang Paifeng" and "Hua Mao Xi Cui Ping" as opening acts on his debut.</p>
<h3>Scenes from the Entertainment World</h3>
<p>— Xin Juan</p>
<p>Since the Rongwei Company disbanded, another CZC Entertainment Co., Ltd. has emerged. The company's organization includes drama, opera, and puppet shows. It is said that the performance venue will likely be the Jindu Grand Theater.</p>
<p>Fei Hua, a newcomer at the Hongbao Theater, is a very promising drama actor who gave a good performance in "Tears of the Red Silk".</p>
<p>The Shangyi's "Second Dream" is scheduled to run until the 15th. From the 16th, "Money Tree" will be performed.</p>
<p>Li Pingqian's adapted stage play "Four Sisters" will be made into a movie, with Long Qiuxia playing the eldest sister, Chen Qi playing the second sister, Shen Hao playing the third sister, and Chen Juanjuan playing the fourth sister.</p>
<p>Yue Feng's adaptation of the Western film "Wasted Youth" has invited Gao Zhanfei and Chen Yanyan to play the male and female leads respectively.</p>
<p>Ma-Xu Weibang's "Cold Mountain Night Rain" has been one-third completed since filming began.</p>
<p>Chen Yanyan and Liu Qiong's "Madame Butterfly" will be screened at the Da Guangming for one week, from the 9th to the 15th.</p>
<p>The Huaxia Amateur Theater Company is currently actively rehearsing Yu Ling's "Women's Apartment". The directors are Xia Feng and Wang Jixu, and the fourth public performance is scheduled for the 18th and 19th of this month at the Lafayette Theater.</p>
<p>In addition to Xi Qiuxia singing the theme song in "Roses Everywhere", Yin Xiucen also participates in the chorus. After "Bachelor Wang", Fatty Yin hasn't sung on screen for a long time. (Note: The "Journey to the West Song" in "Princess Iron Fan" is not a face-to-face performance.) Those who love Fatty Yin's singing should not miss this opportunity.</p>
<p>Xiao Keng, who is considered "interestingly cute" for playing Hai'er in "Home" and "Spring" on stage, also makes a cameo appearance as Hai'er in the film "Spring". This child is intelligent and may take the place of the child star Li Keng in his prime.</p>
<p>The matter of actors standing guard has been discussed for some time, and it seems inevitable. However, if Han Langen and Yin Xiucen were asked to stand guard, there wouldn't be a need to set up barbed wire, as they would probably be blocked by a "net of people" so that the road would be impassable.</p>
<p>Opening in Mid-Autumn Festival</p>
<p>The theater, located at 444 Ge Xu Road, has been undergoing complete reconstruction since last week. According to Mr. Sun, the designer and supervisor of the theater, the facade will be completed within this month, and the interior will be completed by the end of July. As for the opening date, it is planned to be before the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
<p>The theater occupies ten acres, which is not very large, but it is designed according to the most exquisite patterns in the British Betler Theatre architecture book. The facade will be made of black artificial stone, and there will be two twelve-foot-tall nude female statues, the latest works of the Italian sculptor Nilu.</p>
<p>New Type of Equipment</p>
<p>The lobby is longer than most theaters, which is to accommodate various novel devices. The theater has 500 sofa seats that are 20 inches wide, and there is no balcony. The stage curtain is purple-red velvet, and the stage surface is similar to that of the Lyceum Theatre. Behind the stage, there are separate dressing rooms for male and female actors, including hot and cold water sanitary facilities. In addition, there are changing rooms, lounges, and scenery rooms. In front of the stage, there are five-color stage lights. The so-called five-color stage lights are used to inform the audience of the stage play, the curtain lights, and various signals for raising and lowering the curtain. All of the above equipment is fully compliant with the most ideal stage theater.</p>
<p>Abolishing Bad Habits</p>
<p>Because there are two months of ample time, all the projects are taken very seriously. The Lin Da Construction Company is responsible for all civil engineering work, and the Yi Zhong Company is responsible for the ironwork. According to manager Li Qianyu and deputy manager Ren Yutian, this theater exceptionally has an art trademark. The art trademark, Jiahe, represents culture; the mask represents drama; and the lion represents authority. As for whether stage plays or Peking opera will be performed in the future, Li and Ren smiled and said that they would refrain from commenting for the time being.</p>
<p>Finally, it was learned that the theater began preparations last year, with a confirmed capital of three million yuan. Management will be absolutely scientific, resolutely abolishing the bad habits that have been followed in the past. Another feature is that the female attendants will be publicly recruited by a certain drama school, because it is hoped that the female attendants will not only be young and beautiful, gentle and considerate, but also be able to speak fluent Mandarin and have great theatrical talent, so that they can also be trained to perform on stage at any time.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(6) A Snap of the Fingers</p>
<p>Following that, it rained for three or four days, and the Ye family members were all idle indoors. Cuizhen told Second Madam Ye, "Brother Yicheng's appetite has been less by half a bowl these past two days compared to before. I wonder if he's not feeling well." Second Madam Ye questioned Weicheng, who replied, "It's nothing." Thereupon, in the main hall of the Shide Hall, he performed a set of Eight Brocades exercises for Second Madam Ye to see. Second Madam Ye smiled and said, "I only wish you good health." Weicheng saw Second Madam Ye and Cuizhen both doing needlework, and Ah Xing and He Zixing and others twisting straw ropes. Rainy days had their own work. But he himself felt an indescribable sense of boredom. Suddenly, someone outside called out, "Mail!" This sound, as it reached Weicheng's ears, was particularly sharp. Looking towards the front gate, he saw a postman, wearing a raincoat, his whole body drenched in rain, taking a letter out of his canvas bag. Ah Xing was already reaching out to receive it. But Weicheng, from the Shide Hall, disregarding the rain above and the dampness below, went straight across the courtyard towards the front gate to receive the letter. Second Madam Ye shouted, "The ground is slippery!" Cuizhen shouted, "Be careful not to fall!" But he heard none of it.</p>
<p>It was not a registered letter or an express letter, but a regular letter. The letter, as it met Weicheng's eyes, had "Chen, Shanghai" as the last line. He was overjoyed. He took it to the Shuangmei Study, placed it on the table, and hurriedly looked for something, unable to find it on the table, nor in the drawers. Cuizhen chuckled beside him and said, "Are you looking for this?" She handed him a pair of scissors. Weicheng said, "Yes." He took the scissors and cut open the letter. It contained only a few words: "Weicheng: I have broken my promise to you. I am very sorry. Following that, my mother came to talk, knowing that you had been to Shuangqiao, I am even more sorry. Now I cannot return to Shuangqiao, nor can I go to Huagang, because I have listened to the advice of my classmates and am using the summer break to study nursing. Regardless of whether it is useful or not, learning some skills is always good. Are you doing well at home? How is Sister Cuizhen? I heard that my elder brother has entered the Mandarin Department to practice Mandarin, and I haven't seen him for many days. If you miss me, take an extra look at Sister Cuizhen's face, it's the same. Is my language humorous? When school starts in the second half of the year, perhaps there will be a chance to meet. Fang."
