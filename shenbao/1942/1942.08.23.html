<h3>日軍防空司令部發表談話　闡述注意事項</h3>
<p>關於防空警戒、本市日陸海軍防空司令部、業已發出第一號、第二號、第二號佈告、於第一號佈告中說明、空防實施大綱及關於警報及燈火管制之事項、於第二號佈告中指示民間防空重要措施之家庭防空事項、第三號佈告頒發實施燈火管制之命令、惟各市民對於各項規定、不無疑問之點、日陸海軍防空司令部當局爰發表談話、分述各項應加注意事項如次、</p>
<p>一、關於空襲時之處置　空　時所發生之各項情形如下（甲）炸彈爆炸而引起破壞死傷及破壞物落下四散、受間接之損傷（乙）炸彈爆發時、發生一氧化碳及其他有毒瓦斯、（丙）同時多處發生火災、（丁）水管設備破壞、以致斷水及自來水外溢、（戊）燃料及點燈用煤氣設備破壞、以致供給斷絕、或煤氣外溢（已）敵方故意使用毒瓦斯彈時、有毒氣發散、然空襲所受之損害、並不如一般人所理想中之恐怖、故應沈着處置、則受損不致過重、標準處置大致如下、</p>
<p>（甲）各家庭照防空司令部第二號佈告、着重於防火而取行勸、（乙）如在戶外則掩以適當之遮蔽物、（丙）需車汽車等車輛應停於適當地位、（丁）官廳及公司事務　等依照家庭防空防火指導要綱、採取警戒、</p>
<p>二、關於燈火準備管制燈火管制分準備管制、警戒管制、空襲管制等三種、簡明言之、所謂警戒管制者、係於敵機自其根據地起飛、或將空襲上海亦未可知、或在某海面發現敵方航空母艦時、乃發出警戒管制令、</p>
<p>空襲管制、係上海確爲空襲目標、敵機來襲時發令之謂、然考慮現代飛機之性能時、敵機未必依照預定時間來襲、故無空襲之虞時、戰時中燈火亦予以適當管制、以免在遠距離之外、對敵機顯示目標、並作準備以備實施警戒管制、此即準備管制也、</p>
<p>鑒於上述各點，故於十二日起，命令實施準備管制，上海市亦已踏上戰時民防施策之第一步，因之準備管制必須繼續至戰爭結束時爲止，至於準備管制時期中，應予熄滅之燈火，暫時指定爲招牌燈類，然今後視情形，逐步整理非必要燈火，希望市民對居處燈火，將非必要燈火加以整理。</p>
<p>又司令部對實施準備管制，希望</p>
<p>（甲）儘速完成警戒管制之準備。（乙）戶外燈火，上面予以遮沒，不使在水平以上發　其光源，上半部並塗以黑色。（丙）戶內燈火，自外能見光源（發光之實體如需燈之燈泡）者，覆以警戒管制準備之覆罩，以不使在水平上發見其光源爲度。（丁）高層建築物中，十層以上房間之燈火，以丙項規定之覆罩遮沒光源，其所遮之位置，以自下方四十五度以上不見光源爲度。（戊）店鋪中有過度刺眼之燈火者，應减少燈數或電燈光力。（已）橱窗之光力，務須减少。（庚）汽車等之前燈，依照上項規定予以遮覆，但其角度，汽車水平之時，自燈所直接發出之射光，以不射至十五度以上空中爲度。</p>
<p>三，關於燈火警戒管制，燈火警戒管制，原則上於防空警戒警報發令時實施，故在該時期中，發光應完全熄滅，然警戒管制，於繼續至相當長時期，是以一般市民不能停止業務，且在居住上書，最少限度之燈火亦屬必要者，乃根據此項要求決定警戒管制，希望市民了解此點，予以實施，警戒管制中，應繼續工作，並不使燈光洩露於戶外。</p>
<p>四，關於燈火警戒管制中戶內燈光隱蔽程度，此業於民間防空指導要綱第二號表內規定，茲再加以解說。</p>
<p>（甲）店外燈類（店外即指店面以外之處），如裝飾燈，掛燈，陳列橱窗照明燈其他同類之燈火，在警戒管制中，應全部熄滅。（乙）普通戶內體類，依照下列各要點减低其光度，並遮沒其燈光。</p>
<p>直通外部之鬥口、遮以黑幕　燈火加上覆罩、且燈火之光度、視覆罩遮蔽燈光之方法而予限制、例如（室廣十二平方米〇·五支燭光以內、一燈光度不得超過二支光、</p>
<p>六、關於燈火管制用材料、（甲）遮光用之黑幕、應使用質厚之黑布　不得巳時亦可用黑色紙、惟紙質易於破損、故希望務須用布製成、</p>
<p>（乙）幫燈遮光覆罩、照上圖製之、</p>
<p>七、防空司令部佈告及當局發表之談話以及其他指示事項、應予剪存、</p>

<h3>姚母遺命助學</h3>
<p>— 記者</p>
<p>讀了昨天本報「遺命助學」的紀載，我們對於姚母趙太夫人彌留的時候，還殷殷以節省喪費資助失學兒童爲念，這不僅是姚氏一家的賢母，却是今日社會偉大母敎的表率。</p>
<p>太夫人為先烈姚定生先生德配，先生於戊戍政變後，斥資興學，在原籍嵊縣手創師曾學堂，經費不繼，夫人恒脫簪珥以助，後先生以指摘淸廷時政，於宣統二年慘遭不幸，太夫人銜哀敎子，數十年如一日，「母敎重如山」，今其哲嗣輩均已獻身社會，卓著聲譽，不負太夫人的苦心督敎，道在我們讀到瀧岡阡表　其心厚於仁必將有其後也」，「積善成德，宜享其隆」，於此有其同感。</p>
<p>我們重視這段紀述，不僅在表揚賢母，而是期望能因太未人精誠所感召，一正今日社會的風尚，節省一切糜費，救助失學靑年，這是比任何事業爲急要。姚氏昆仲，秉承母敎，亦足稱述，此種義舉，正是「母改於父母之道，可謂孝矣」。</p>
<p>模範的賢母，模範的家庭，造福學子，濟人利世，不獨親其親，子其子，使優秀靑年，續其學業，我們於敬佩之餘，謹略叙其所感如此。</p>
<h3>水電節約法</h3>
<p>— 蕭鵑</p>
<p>處此百物昂貴的時代，做一個當家的主婦實是非常不容易的，然而貴儘管貴，生活還是要生活，於是在某些地方就不得不節省些了。水電費是每月的經常支出，節省水電不但可减低家庭經濟的開銷，而目更可節省公共事業的資源。一個家庭裏，節水與節雷只耍行之得當，節之得法，是絕對不會因少用而感不便的。下面乃是筆者經騐之談。</p>
<p>一，節水之道</p>
<p>自來水籠頭要注意開關：近來一種新式籠頭是手壓式的，要水時，用手一壓水便流出，不用時，手一放，水即停止。這種籠頭沒有忘閉或閉而未緊還繼續流水的毛病，在公共塲所採用得很多，通常家庭中還不常見。目下水費浩大做主婦的不妨向水實行家詢問詳情應否改裝？這是很値得顧慮的。至於籠頭漏水，若不立刻修好，這種消耗，數可驚人，萬勿忽視。衣服要集中洗滌：穿污了的衣服，尤其是夏天的單衣汗杉等，不要脫下一件就洗一件，最好是積下三五件或十幾件一起洗。這樣，水當然省了許多。</p>
<p>廢水的利用：洗衣洗下來的第二次淸水，可以用它灑地或揩地板。洗米和洗菜的剩水，可以用來灌澆花木。</p>
<p>日常的節約：平常洗面，洗手，洗碗、，洗菜用水亦須儘量節約。因為這些都是天天的事，甚至一天要行數次，積少成多，每次浪費一些，全部即浪費許多，反之，每次省一些，全部即省訐多，所謂「省」，並非是應該用而不用，而是省在不該用而濫用。</p>
<p>二，節電之道</p>
<p>注意電燈開關：這是節電中最易實行的一法，但也是最容易使人忽略的地方。往往一家人都到飯廳去吹晚飯，而臥室裹却雖無人而點得通明，這顯然是毫無理由的無謂消耗，這裏就需要主婦的留心了。最好在臨睡前巡視一遍，看一看廚房浴室走廊的燈是否都已熄滅、用檯燈看書或寫字，完畢時應立即閉關，無錢雷收音機不聽時也要閉上電門。</p>
<p>選用良好燈泡：買價廉貨劣的燈泡是吃虧的，老牌燈泡價雖貴一些，却光亮，省電而經用，雖貴也値得。</p>
<p>選用效能最大的燈罩：燈罩的效能由於形狀，顏色，材料的不同，而有很大的出入，這要用房間的色彩和美藝去配合的。</p>
<p>其他雷氣機械的使用亦應注意：　電鈴所需電壓極小，故常鈴響的時候，電表並不走字。　最普通收音機用電約當十五支光，故用電也不多。　常用的十六吋桌上電扇，用電量約合四十支光。　電熨斗，電爐，均在三百瓦特以上，耗電特多，不用為妙，最好少用。</p>
<p>最後，主婦最好能學會換保險絲，接電綫等普通小技能，以免省去電料行伙計的敲竹槓。總之，浪費是不必要的，隨便做那一件事都如此，希望大家記牢。</p>
<h3>家事一得</h3>
<p>— 自强</p>
<p>咖啡污衣　凡爲茶或咖啡所污之衣　物或檯布，可以冷水濕之，候二，三小時後，再以溫水，和鷄蛋黃洗之，則污點自退。</p>
<p>草帽去污　用硫黃粉和檸檬汁，攪勻如糊，用硬刷蘸面刷之，更用布拭乾，曝日中，即日如新。</p>
<p>去果子漬　衣服檯布等若染果汁之跡，可以麵粉撒於跡上，數小時，共跡自去，</p>
<p>扇面墨污　以海螺蛸磨之，自去。</p>
<p>衣服去霉蹟　衣服有霉跡，以一匙監丹，及一杯安母尼亞水，融解於一匙之淸水中，融化之水，即塗在霉跡上擦之，擦畢，置在風中吹乾，閱數點鐘後，用淸水如普通洗衣法洗之，霉跡即能去淨。</p>

<h3>葛氏家書二十封</h3>
<p>— 徐百益譯</p>
<p>葛氏家書是美國葛賴亨食品公司的主人翁葛賴亨先生寫給他兒子的，裏面充滿着人生的哲學。他所說的話，其實也就是現代一般做父親的所要說的。共計二十封，每一封討論一個問題，本刊自從本期起，運續刋載，希望讀者注意。</p>
<p>下面是第一封信，是葛賴亨先生的兒子剛考進哈佛大學一年級時葛賴亨先生在芝加哥所發出的。</p>
<p>第一封信</p>
<p>大學敎育親愛的兒子：</p>
<p>你的母親今天安然同到家裏，她要我寫一封信夾叫你不要太用功，但我却要你格外的用功。你要知道，我們所以送你到吟佛大學是爲了使你可以在那裏得到很多的有用的敎育。你日後自會知道，敎育是此間散佈在各處而最容易得到的東西，一個人可以儘量的獲取。共他的一切東西，那就不同了，如果你要享受你的份兒，就沒有敎育那般容易。</p>
<p>我在年輕的時候，就沒有你這樣的福氣，但是你也不會有我一樣的遭遇。有許多人以爲要知道金錢的價値是赤手空拳自己去賺，也有人以爲應該由父親傳下五萬元來而極力去用掉·有人說要知道誠實的眞理，只要和一般滑頭去做生意，有人却以爲非到星期學校裏去上課不可。有人說有了一個喝酒的父親，就可以知道惠司格酒的害處，但有人說只要有一個賢明的母親。以敎育來論，有許多人以爲可以從別人或是報紙上或是公共圖書館裏得到學問，有人却以爲是須由敎授們敎導的。但無論如何，怎樣得到學問的方式，並不是一個甫要的問題，因爲形式是無關緊要的，就像一隻美麗的匣子別人吃了裏面的束西，匣子就被棄去了。</p>
<p>我希望你成爲一個良好的學者，但我更希望你成爲一個淸白的人。如果你在畢業的時候有一顆純潔的心，就是你的臘－文有一些缺點我也不來怪你。在大學裏你可以得到一種敎育，一種在敎室裏，一種是從同單那裹得來的，事實上第一種比較起來更爲重要，因爲第一種祇能使你成爲一個學者，第　種可以使你知道怎樣做人。敎育又好像是吃飯，你不會知道什麼東西吹了會發達你的肌肉，但你可以知道什麽東西吃了會生毛病，所以不論是臘丁或是代數，或是歷史，你儘可以讀進去，決不會予你有害，唯有享樂，甜蜜的事情，纔會使你胃痛，所以你應該愼重選擇。</p>
<p>有人往往在間大學敎育不是値得的呢？常牠能彀促進人們思想的時候，牠是値得的。常牠可以使一個靑年在別人正咬着鉛筆對答不出的時候而回答出來時，牠是値得的。大學不會產生聰明的人，但可以造就聰明的人，因爲一個愚笨的人終究是一個笨人，是不是在大學裏讀書是　無關係的。你得知道單是讀書是沒有用處的，讀了能敬應用，纔是我所期望的。</p>
<p>你的父親葛賴亨。</p>
<h3>安貧味</h3>
<p>本刋前期錄登清凉散一服，頗為讀者所注意；茲成宗</p>
<p>家幹君函告，該文為錢塘沈竹　先生所撰之一安貧味一，原文詞意精警透澈，實爲極有價値之作品。（沈先生爲上海錢業巨子，錢業規條，即其手創，至今不替，先生並著有周易易解等醫行世。）茲以前期所刊，與原文稍有出人，特重錄一過，以餉讀者，深望細加體會，視作座右銘可也。並向宗先生誌謝。</p>
<p>黃菜葉，用鹽炒，只要撑得肚皮飽；若因滋味妄貪求</p>
<p>，俯仰增煩惱？</p>
<p>破衲頭，無價寶，補上又補年年好；盈箱滿籠替人藏，何會件件穿到老！</p>
<p>硬木床，舖軟草，高枕無憂夢不擾：錦衾繡褥不成眠，翻來覆去天尸曉！</p>
<p>舊房屋，只要掃，及時修理便不倒；近來多少好樓台，半成瓦礫生靑草！</p>
<h3>介紹幾本營養書籍</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>營養間題的解決，並不是一個純粹的經濟問題，而是一個敎育問題，前次靑年會舉行衛生營養展覽會中，有中華健康雜誌的營養專號出售，每冊　元，和上海雷　氏德聲學硏究院侯祥川博士所著的「食物與養生」一響，每冊售價六角。</p>
<p>如果讀者對於營養問題，感覺興趣，那末中華醫學曾有「吾們吃什麽」，「上海的食物」，「中國民衆最低限度之營養需要」等書，値得賻讀，尤其是主婦們讀了，可以養全家大小，獲得充足的營養。</p>

<h3>Central Route Orel Front: German Army Launches New Offensive; Fierce Fighting Rages on the Outskirts of Stalingrad; German Forces on the Southern Route Continue to Make Progress on Both Flanks</h3>
<p>Berlin, 22nd, Allied News Agency: The Supreme Headquarters announced last night that German forces have launched a new offensive in the Orel area, 160 miles northwest of Voronezh, advancing along the Orel-Yeletz railway towards the city of Yeletz, a distance of approximately 110 miles. This city serves as the base for the Southern Army's offensive against the northern German defense line of Voronezh. This offensive is still in its initial stages, and it remains to be seen whether it will be expanded.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th, Huitong News Agency: Regarding the battles in the Orel area, official sources announced last night that the German advance has encountered fierce resistance from the Soviet army, which is defending its deeply entrenched positions. Recent heavy rains in the area have made combat extremely difficult. However, with the aid of German aircraft, the German forces have still managed to cross the muddy, heavily mined terrain and seize some enemy positions. The Soviet army has launched several counterattacks, all of which have failed. The German forces have pushed several kilometers into enemy territory, and after hand-to-hand combat, several enemy bunkers have been captured. With the help of aircraft and tanks, the German infantry has annihilated 5,000 enemy soldiers. German aircraft are extremely active in this area, having destroyed enemy artillery, roads, supply columns, motor vehicle units, and railways.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 21st, Havas News Agency: Today marks the 425th day of the German-Soviet war. The most noteworthy developments on the Eastern Front are the battles near Stalingrad and the increasingly active German forces in the Orel region. The war situation in various locations is summarized as follows: The "bottleneck" between the Don and Volga rivers remains a scene of intense fighting, seemingly approaching its final stage. The German army has deployed a large number of reinforcements, hoping to achieve a decisive victory, as this victory is of great importance to the overall war situation. The Soviet side has also deployed a large number of reinforcements, strengthening the Red Army's resistance. The Red Army General Staff has dispatched armored vehicle units to launch fierce counterattacks in various sectors along the Stalingrad line, but has not been able to stop the German advance. Fierce fighting has erupted from Kletskaya in the north to Kotelnikovo in the south, possibly the most intense of the entire Second World War. At the same time, the German army has begun to employ a pincer strategy, with Stalingrad threatened from the west, and increasingly threatened from the northwest and southwest. To the south of the city, German forces are increasing pressure along the Krasnodar railway, and the Red Army's fortified positions have been breached, with many bunkers captured by German assault troops. German forces and their allies are closing in on the Volga River delta. West of Stalingrad, a German mechanized infantry division has opened a gap in the Red Army's lines, completely disrupting the Red Army's communications in that area. In the Orel region, Berlin sources claim that the German offensive is of great significance. Since the 11th of this month, 14,000 Red Army soldiers have been captured, and 400 Soviet tanks and 200 artillery pieces have been destroyed. The German offensive in this area can be seen as the first step in a large-scale German offensive, aimed at inflicting a fatal blow on the Red Army forces being transferred to the Stalingrad area as reinforcements. The Soviet side also admits that the German pressure on the northwestern line of Stalingrad is very strong. In the Zhev region, the Red Army has launched repeated fierce counterattacks, but has not achieved any success so far. In the Caucasus region, German forces continue to advance despite the extreme heat, making progress on both flanks. German forces appear to have achieved a victory southeast of Krasnodar. It seems that the attempt to defend the Black Sea has failed. In addition, German forces have also made progress in the Grozny oil region.</p>
<p>Moscow, 21st, Havas News Agency: The Red Army General Staff has just issued a communiqué stating that in the past 24 hours, our forces have fought battles east of Kletskaya, northeast of Kotelnikovo, southeast of Pyatigorsk, and south of Krasnodar. There have been no significant changes in other areas. In the Baltic Sea, an enemy oil tanker of 1,500 tons was sunk by our navy.</p>
<h3>Exchange of Sick and Wounded Civilians between Japan and the United States</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd, Huitong News Agency: Under the auspices of the Portuguese Red Cross, Japan and the United States have begun exchanging sick and wounded civilians, medicines, and food in Lourenço Marques. These patients, medicines, and food were transported by the Swedish ship Gripsholm, the Italian ship Count Verde, and the Japanese ship Asama Maru. To date, 4,200 packages of food have been exchanged. The number of sick and wounded civilians exchanged is not yet known.</p>
<p>Scouring Resources of the Ukrainian State; Germany Prepares for Winter in Soviet Territory</p>
<p>Stanford, 21st, Havas News Agency: German Minister of Propaganda Dr. Goebbels, in a meeting with a Turkish press delegation, stated that German forces will still be spending the winter in the Soviet Union this year, and the war will continue. However, because the Soviet Union's war machine has already been greatly weakened, German forces will not encounter a major crisis. Last winter, we were in an extremely difficult and precarious situation. Today, the Soviet Union has lost most of its resources and its strength has been weakened, while the German forces can utilize last year's experience to prepare for the difficulties of the coming winter. When a reporter asked about the possibility of Britain and the United States opening a second front, Goebbels immediately replied that he did not believe that democratic countries could achieve anything in this regard. Since our country defeated France, our strength has far surpassed that of Britain. Opening a second front would only accelerate our victory, so we are now eagerly awaiting Britain and the United States to make this decision.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the German Border, 21st, Havas News Agency: German High Commissioner for the Occupied Territories of Ukraine, Koch, recently stated to the press that Germany's victory depends on the various efforts currently underway in Ukraine. The important task of the German authorities in Ukraine is to mobilize all resources within the territory. Ukraine must supply the German forces on the Eastern Front with all necessary food and must transport essential raw materials and wheat to Germany. All transportation lines must also be repaired. In addition, a large number of workers should be sent to Germany to replace the German workers who have been sent to the Eastern Front to fight. Although this plan is fraught with difficulties, the wheat yield is 90% of normal, so the rations given to the German people have been greatly increased. There are now 500,000 Ukrainians working in Germany.</p>
<h3>Provisional Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions; Minister Zhou Issues Statement; Implemented First in Three Provinces and Two Cities</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd: Central News Agency reports that the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions" recently drafted by the Ministry of Finance have been promulgated. Minister Zhou, regarding this matter, has issued the following statement: The "Provisional Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions" recently drafted by this Ministry have been submitted and approved for implementation. At the time of promulgation, the following points are specifically stated: Investigating the economy and stabilizing finance are the inherent responsibilities of this Ministry. Banks are the organs for regulating finance, and finance is the lifeblood of industry and commerce. Its ebb and flow directly relate to the rise and fall of various industries and indirectly affect the prosperity and decline of society. If the government does not strictly establish regulations and implement appropriate management, it will not be sufficient for adjustment and compliance. In March of the 20th year of the Republic [1931], the National Government promulgated the Banking Law, but due to various reasons, it has not been implemented to this day. In order to meet the needs of society, this Ministry, after the National Government returned to the capital, has appropriately amended the previously promulgated "Banking Registration Regulations" and its "Implementing Rules" to serve as a basis. However, the aforementioned regulations and rules were inadequate and simplified, so the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions," comprising a total of seventeen articles, have been carefully formulated to allow those engaged in financial activities to know what to accept and reject, and for this Ministry to effectively supervise and manage. These measures will be implemented first in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and in the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai. In addition to issuing a separate ministerial order, this Ministry's measures regarding financial institutions will be strictly implemented in accordance with the provisions of these measures. All banks, silver houses, silver companies, and other financial institutions in the aforementioned provinces and cities must understand the government's intentions and comply in unison in order to regulate the economy and stabilize finance. Article 2 of these measures stipulates that financial institutions that have already commenced business must, within one month from the date of implementation of these measures, apply to the Ministry of Finance for supplementary registration. We hope that you will pay attention and comply with this requirement. After these measures are implemented, there will be no conflict with the existing "Revised Banking Registration Regulations" and its "Implementing Rules," and they can complement each other, making the registration procedures more complete.</p>
<p>The above points are merely a summary of the main points. We sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will understand this intent and diligently implement it, so that this Ministry can fulfill its supervisory duties while safeguarding the financial system, stabilizing the people's livelihood. This is our sincere hope.</p>

<h3>As Special Envoy of the President, Willkie to Visit the Soviet Union; to Explain the Truth of America's War Efforts; British and American People Urge Governments to Open Second Front</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd, Allied News Agency: President Roosevelt met with reporters yesterday and stated that Republican presidential candidate from the last election, Willkie's, trip to the Soviet Union and the Near East is in the nature of a presidential special envoy. His main task is to "explain the truth of how America is fighting." Willkie is also the leader of the second largest party in the United States, making him the natural choice. In addition to visiting the Soviet Union, this trip will also take him to countries such as Egypt, Arabia, Palestine, Syria, Turkey, Iraq, and Iran. It is best to refer to his title as "Special Representative of the President," as he will be carrying letters from the President, not only to personally deliver them to American figures in these countries, but also to personally deliver them to Stalin and other authorities in various countries.</p>
<p>Washington, 21st, Havas News Agency: President Roosevelt told the press today that Willkie will carry letters from me to the leaders of various countries when he travels to the Middle East and the Soviet Union. Therefore, Willkie's trip can truly be called my personal representative. There are rumors abroad that our country's industrial production has been greatly affected by labor strikes. After Willkie's visits to various countries, this view will disappear without a trace. In addition, I deeply regret that some civil servants in our government lack prudence. I have now issued strict instructions, ordering the heads of government agencies not to speak arbitrarily on any matter, even those unrelated to politics.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 22nd, Huitong News Agency: It has just been reported here that Willkie will be accompanied by Colonel Colds and Bernal of the U.S. Army Intelligence Department when he goes to Moscow.</p>

Meetings are being held throughout Britain under the auspices of factory committees, unanimously passing resolutions requesting the government to take immediate action. The same sentiment exists among workers in the United States."</p>

<p>Andaman Islands Independence Movement</p>
<p>Andaman, 22nd, Allied News Agency: When the British army withdrew from here, in order to eliminate the root of the Indian independence movement, they took away influential political figures in the prisons. However, many of the island's patriots were rescued by the Japanese army and regained their freedom. They resolutely rose up to fight for the independence and freedom of their motherland. Upon learning that Gandhi and others had been arrested by the British, they were deeply angered, shouting that they would vow to use their blood to fight for independence and freedom without ceasing. Recently, Indians here have been flocking to join the Indian Independence League, led by President Davinson, to participate in the volunteer army. As of the 19th, 2,000 Indians had joined and training has already begun. According to the league president, Davinson, he met his Indian revolutionary mentor, Gandhi, twenty years ago when he was studying at university. At that time, he vowed to become Gandhi's comrade. The following year, he initiated an independence movement and was arrested, imprisoned in Lahore prison for three months. He firmly followed Gandhi's words, waiting for the opportunity to come. Therefore, after being released from prison, he came here to practice medicine. For twenty years, he has been ashamed of having achieved nothing due to the strict surveillance of the British government. After the Japanese army occupied this place, we regained our freedom and obtained a happy life. Today, we can no longer ignore reality. If we do not seize this opportunity to become independent, then it will be impossible to seek independence even after thousands of years. The opportunity that Gandhi spoke of has now been brought by the Japanese army. We are willing to fight bare-handed. I am determined to stand at the head of the volunteer army, in front of the machine guns, and lead my compatriots to fight.</p>

<h3>Electricity Company and Central China Water and Electricity Company Plan to Connect Main Generators; Coal Price Reduction and Electricity Surcharge Increase Reduced; Water and Gas Items Failed to be Reduced</h3>
<p>Because the Shanghai Electric Power Company's coal price was reduced by 14 yuan per ton, it has reduced the fuel surcharge charged to users by 15%, and it has been retroactively calculated from June 20th. This is the first step to reduce public utilities costs with the help of the authorities.</p>
<p>Users May Not Have Noticed</p>
<p>Few electric power company users may have noticed the reduction in the fuel surcharge on their monthly bills. Some large manufacturers who closely investigate their monthly electricity consumption may already know about the fuel surcharge reduction, but ordinary household users have not noticed. It is investigated that the basic electricity fee is one yuan per kilowatt hour in Central Reserve Certificates, implemented from [blank] of this year, [blank] reduced.</p>
<p>Reduction of Seven Cents Per Kilowatt Hour</p>
<p>The reduction refers to the fuel surcharge with the letters "SC" on the bill. From May 20th to June 19th, the fuel surcharge was 56 cents per kilowatt hour, and [blank] was 49 cents per kilowatt hour. After a 15% reduction, [blank] , there has been no formal announcement about this matter. The public believes that if the price [blank] is further reduced, then the electric power company will once again reduce its fuel surcharge.</p>
<p>Water and Gas Not Reduced</p>
<p>An [blank] of the Shanghai Waterworks Company stated that [blank] they did not know about this. [Blank] The waterworks company is currently not [blank] reducing water charges. Since the change from old legal tender to Central Reserve Certificates, water charges have not changed. Furthermore, an official from the Shanghai Gas Company stated that the company issued an announcement on July 24th explaining the business losses, and new fees were implemented on May 20th to compensate for them. Until the losses have been compensated, it is not possible to reduce gas charges. As for when the losses can be fully compensated, [blank] he could not determine, as it would depend on the supply of raw materials and the manufacture of gas, etc.</p>
<p>Connection Under Discussion</p>
<p>It is heard that the matter of connecting the main power lines of the Shanghai Electric Power Company and the Central China Water and Electricity Company to unify the distribution of electricity is still under discussion. This plan is still in its initial stages. Once approval is obtained from the Asia Development Board and the necessary materials are available, the two companies [blank] will begin to centralize the electricity supply in order to save on power generation costs.</p>
<h3>Four Deaths Yesterday Suspected of Cholera</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of 17,287 people in the two concessions received anti-epidemic injections, most of whom applied in the French Concession, totaling 12,94 people, while the International Settlement accounted for only 6,093 people. The [blank] Health [blank] Office of the French Concession only received three suspected cholera cases yesterday, but two people died. At the same time, twelve cases were discovered in the Public Settlement, with two deaths as well. Although most citizens have now been vaccinated, the Public Settlement is facing its entrants and is still sending personnel from the police station to ask them to show their anti-epidemic certificates. As for those entering the French Concession from Nanshi, the French police are also [blank] strictly checking the anti-epidemic certificates.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Divided into Two Air Defense Zones; One Naval Zone, One Army Zone; Light Control Assigned to Baojia</h3>
<p>After the Japanese naval and army authorities announced that Shanghai would conduct a blackout drill next Tuesday, the Air Defense Section of the Public Settlement Police Department disclosed on the 21st that it had formed an Air Defense Committee three days ago. The committee held a meeting at the Police Department's entertainment [blank] hall on Thursday afternoon, which lasted a long time and discussed the implementation of controls on street and indoor lighting.</p>
<p>Traffic Lights All Under Control</p>
<p>It is said that all lighting control measures will be stipulated by the Japanese authorities, and Shanghai will be divided into two air defense zones, A and B, one naval zone and one army zone, managed separately by the Japanese army and navy authorities. During the meeting on Thursday, it was decided to entrust the task of managing streetcar lights, hotels, restaurants, and indoor lights to the Baojia system, and the work of the Public Settlement Police Force will be [blank] adjusted accordingly. According to [blank] [blank] the electricity company, street lights are difficult to control. All thunder power, if not temporarily cut off, cannot be cut off at all. It is difficult to adjust the distribution of power. However, it is certain that preparations for managing traffic lights and car lights have been completed, as previously announced.</p>
<p>Police Department Responsible for Air Defense Matters</p>
<p>Goro Matsumoto, Assistant Chief of the Traffic Section of the Police Department, will be responsible for all air defense-related matters in the future. Matsumoto also leads the Air Defense Committee, whose twelve members are all Japanese police officers. The Air Defense Committee discussed at the meeting on Thursday how to instruct the volunteer guard corps to handle car lights, bicycle lights, and the limits of permissible lighting during the blackout.</p>
<p>Police Lights Cordoned During Alert Period</p>
<p>The proposed lighting control plan is as follows: During the blackout, the lights of cars, including headlights, sidelights, and searchlights, will be turned off. Only two lights are allowed, and the light of these two lights must be adjusted so that on a flat road, each light illuminates within ten meters, and the maximum brightness [blank] in Zone B is limited to three lux, and in Zone A it is limited to 0.2 lux. As for the boundaries of these two zones, the police have not yet disclosed them, as there has not been a definite announcement.</p>
<p>Zone A Stricter, Zone B More Lenient</p>
<p>In Zone B, during the blackout, there are no restrictions on the taillights, courtesy lights, and stop lights of cars, but in Zone A, these lights must also be turned off. Only one light is allowed to emit light, and the radius must not exceed 300 meters. The lights of bicycles, rickshaws, carts, or carriages, and other similar lights, are not restricted in Zone B, but must be reduced and partially covered in Zone A. Each light is limited to one candlepower. Flashlights and other lights with adjustable brightness are limited to 0.3 candlepower and do not need to be covered. During an air raid, all lights must be turned off. Only indoor lights that are covered and cannot be seen from 300 meters away [blank] do not need to be turned off. According to the Air Defense Section, an air defense group headquarters and branches will be established in the Public Settlement, and the details will be announced before next Tuesday. It is also learned that the Chief Inspector of the French Concession Police, Fabre, the Director of the Fire Department, Bausot, the Director of the Health Department, Barut, and the Director of the French Public Works Department, Baugain, have also [blank] formed the French Concession Air Defense Committee.</p>

<h3>The Japanese Army Air Defense Headquarters Issues a Statement Elaborating on Important Precautions</h3>
<p>Regarding air defense alerts, the Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters in this city have issued the first, second, and third announcements. The first announcement explains the general outline of air defense implementation and matters concerning alarms and lighting control. The second announcement instructs important civil defense measures for home air defense. The third announcement promulgates the order to implement lighting control. However, citizens have questions about various regulations. The Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters have issued a statement elaborating on the following important precautions:</p>
<p>1.  Measures to Take During Air Raids</p>
<p>The various situations that occur during air raids are as follows: (A) Bombs explode, causing damage, death, and injury, and debris falls and scatters, causing indirect damage. (B) When bombs explode, carbon monoxide and other toxic gases are released. (C) Fires occur in multiple locations simultaneously. (D) Water pipe equipment is damaged, causing water outages and overflowing tap water. (E) Fuel and lighting gas equipment is damaged, causing supply interruptions or gas leaks. (F) If the enemy deliberately uses poison gas bombs, toxic gas will be released. However, the damage caused by air raids is not as terrible as generally imagined. Therefore, if dealt with calmly, the damage will not be too severe. The standard measures are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Each family should follow the second announcement of the Air Defense Headquarters and focus on fire prevention. (B) If outdoors, take cover with appropriate shelter. (C) Cars and other vehicles should be parked in appropriate places. (D) Government offices and company offices [blank] should take precautions in accordance with the home air defense and fire prevention guidelines.</p>
<p>2.  Preparations for Lighting Control</p>
<p>Lighting control is divided into three types: preparation control, alert control, and air raid control. In simple terms, alert control is when enemy aircraft take off from their base or may attack Shanghai, or when an enemy aircraft carrier is discovered on a certain sea surface, an alert control order is issued.</p>
<p>Air raid control is when Shanghai is definitely the target of an air raid and enemy aircraft are attacking. However, considering the performance of modern aircraft, enemy aircraft may not attack according to the scheduled time. Therefore, even when there is no threat of an air raid, lighting is appropriately controlled during wartime to avoid displaying targets to enemy aircraft from a distance and to prepare for the implementation of alert control. This is preparation control.</p>
<p>In view of the above points, the order to implement preparation control has been issued since the 12th, and Shanghai has also embarked on the first step of wartime civil defense measures. Therefore, preparation control must continue until the end of the war. As for the lights that should be extinguished during the preparation control period, sign lights are temporarily designated. However, depending on the circumstances in the future, unnecessary lights will be gradually sorted out. It is hoped that citizens will sort out unnecessary lights in their residences.</p>
<p>The Air Defense Headquarters hopes to implement preparation control to:</p>
<p>(A) Complete the preparation for alert control as soon as possible. (B) Cover outdoor lights from above so that they do not emit light above the horizontal, and paint the upper part black. (C) For indoor lights, cover the light source (the actual light-emitting body, such as the light bulb) visible from the outside with a cover prepared for alert control to the extent that its light source is not visible above the horizontal. (D) In high-rise buildings, the lights in rooms on the tenth floor and above should have their light sources covered by a cover according to the provisions of item C. The position of the cover should be such that the light source is not visible from 45 degrees above from below. (E) Shops with excessively glaring lights should reduce the number of lights or the light output of the lights. (F) The light output of display windows must be reduced. (G) Cover the headlights of cars, etc., according to the above regulations, but the angle should be such that when the car is horizontal, the direct light emitted from the light does not shine above 15 degrees into the air.</p>
<p>3.  About Lighting Alert Control</p>
<p>Lighting alert control is implemented in principle when an air defense alert alarm is issued. Therefore, all lights should be completely extinguished during that period. However, alert control continues for a considerable period of time, so the general public cannot stop working, and a minimum level of lighting is also necessary for living. Alert control is decided based on these requirements. It is hoped that citizens understand this point and implement it. During alert control, work should continue without leaking light outdoors.</p>
<p>4.  Regarding the degree of concealment of indoor lighting during lighting alert control, this has been stipulated in the second table of the civil defense guidance outline, which is now explained further.</p>
<p>(A) Outdoor lights (outdoor refers to places outside the storefront), such as decorative lights, hanging lights, display window lighting, and other similar lights, should be completely extinguished during alert control. (B) Ordinary indoor lights should reduce their brightness and cover their lights in accordance with the following points:</p>
<p>Doorways leading directly to the outside should be covered with black curtains. Lights should be covered, and the brightness of the lights should be limited depending on how the covers obscure the light. For example (rooms with 12 square meters 0.5 candlepower or less, the light output of one light must not exceed 2 candlepower.</p>
<p>6.  Materials for Lighting Control</p>
<p>(A) Black curtains for light shielding should be made of thick black cloth. When it is unavoidable, black paper can also be used, but paper is easily damaged, so it is hoped that cloth will be used.</p>
<p>(B) Light-shielding covers for auxiliary lights should be made according to the diagram above.</p>
<p>7.  Announcements and statements issued by the Air Defense Headquarters, as well as other instructions, should be clipped and saved.</p>
<h3>"Lushan Maru" Arrives in Shanghai from Hong Kong and Guangdong; Expected to Enter Port Today; Many Chinese Passengers Returning to Shanghai from Guangdong; Ship Has Been Docked at Wusongkou for Five Days Due to Two Passenger Deaths from Epidemic</h3>
<p>This summer, the tiger epidemic has been rampant, and the authorities in this city have taken strict precautions. Recently, the weather has become slightly cooler, and the severity of the epidemic has decreased. The customs quarantine office is still strict with the epidemic inspection of imported ships, especially ships arriving in Shanghai from southern China. The epidemic inspection work is even stricter. No matter what ship, it must anchor outside Wusongkou for 24 hours, waiting for the inspection to be completed before being allowed to enter the port. The "Lushan Maru" of the East Asia Shipping Company arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong and Guangdong the day before yesterday. On Tuesday of this week (the 18th), it arrived at Wusongkou, anchored in the Sanjia Water area as usual, and waited for inspection. However, it had not been seen entering the port by yesterday evening. It is heard that this time the ship carried many Chinese passengers returning to Shanghai from Guangdong, and two passengers died of the epidemic en route. Therefore, the inspection procedures for this ship are more complicated than for ordinary imported ships. It has been anchored outside the port for five days. According to the company yesterday, the inspection work was completed yesterday. If no special accidents occur, it should be able to enter the port this afternoon.</p>

<h3>There Will Be New Developments in Chinese Stocks; The Chinese Stock Exchange Association Will Hold a Preparatory Meeting</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market experienced a weekend trading slowdown, with market sentiment shifting from weak to stable. This was mainly because there were no speculative short-selling transactions in the Chinese stock industry. All transactions were genuine buying and selling of physical goods based on managing customer investments, absorbing funds, and selling off existing holdings. Now that the establishment of the Chinese Stock Exchange Association has been approved by the Bureau of Finance, the various misunderstandings that have been circulating for days have been swept away, and the industry is about to undergo a new phase of development. As a result, the previously nervous investors have stabilized their sentiments. Buyers have become more eager to buy on dips, and market prices have consequently seen a squeeze, especially in the case of Zhabei Water &amp; Electricity, which broke through the 30 yuan level, squeezing up the most by 1.25 yuan. China Electric has stabilized, down by 0.25 yuan. In the cultural sector, only China Bookstore fell slightly by 5 yuan, entering the 170 yuan level. Commercial Press and World Book saw a flattening trend after initial weakness, with new buyers entering the market. In the department store sector, Wing On fell by 2 yuan, entering the 100 yuan level, while China Underwear fell by 0.75 yuan. The price of Sincere Company remained unchanged from the previous day. The pharmaceutical sector was relatively weak, with China Asia down by 0.75 yuan. Sino-French Pharmaceutical fell by 1.5 yuan, retreating to the 70 yuan level. Minyi Pharmaceutical fell by 2 yuan, while Sin-I Yi remained strong, with buyers still present at 830 yuan. The decline in Great China Match was also minimal, down by only 1 yuan. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco was trending flat. The stock market price list is recorded below:</p>

It is said that a preparatory meeting will be convened soon.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Gently Fluctuating, Market Prices Vary</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the government bond market saw gentle fluctuations, with a generally upward trend. Trading opened at a high price of 9.20 yuan, and various bonds followed suit, mostly showing gains. However, large investors continued to reduce their holdings of Type C bonds, so the prices were pressured down during the session due to the selling pressure. Types A and B bonds remained firm, with buyers hesitant about Type C bonds, tracking the sale of Type C bonds and buying Types A and B. In fact, the buying and selling of large investors is entirely related to the allocation of funds, and has no significant impact on the bonds themselves. It is equally possible to buy Types A and B and sell Type C now, or to sell Types A and B and buy Type C in the future. Therefore, there is no reason to believe that Types A and B will have a different trend from other types of bonds. In summary, the rise in Types A and B may reflect a general strengthening trend in other types of bonds, so sellers should be cautious and maintain a stable position. Total trading volume for the city was approximately 2 million yuan. The table below lists the details:</p>
<p>Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing Price | Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>Unified A | 41.40 | 40.90 | 41.20 | Up 0.60</p>
<p>Unified B | 39.40 | 39.00 | 39.20 | Up 0.10</p>
<p>Unified C | 39.20 | 38.70 | 38.90 | Up 0.10</p>
<p>Unified D | 36.10 | 35.70 | 35.90 | Flat</p>
<p>Unified E | 36.30 | 36.70 | 36.90 | Flat</p>
<h3>Gold Ornaments Remain Consistently Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, gold shops quoted the price of new jewelry gold at 2,150 yuan per tael (buying back at around 300 yuan less).

The morning price was 1,900 yuan, briefly rising to 1,905 yuan, before falling back slightly to 1,895 yuan. The noon transaction price was 1,900 yuan, the same as the previous day. There were no sales at the closing price, with only a 10 yuan difference. Trading was minimal. Silver ornaments were still quoted at 16 yuan, with an inter-dealer price of 10.89 yuan.</p>

Starting from August 24th, the commission will collect payment instruments from the various banks and firms, following the same procedure as other member firms.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Remains Weak</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the market was soft due to the continued decline in Eastern cloth prices. Sellers were unified in offering goods to downstream buyers. White goods fell by 2-3 yuan per piece. 16-pound Globe coarse cloth was 179 yuan, Flying Swan 176 yuan, 9-pound New Character 109 yuan, 12-pound Globe fine cloth 158.5 yuan, Fookai Bank single 142 yuan, Dapeng Bank single hand goods were sold cheaply at only 141.5 yuan, Fookai fine twill 127 yuan, Magnolia bleached cloth 160 yuan, Qin Liangyu 150 yuan.

<h3>Sweet Potato Dry Selected Based on Price</h3>
<p>Sales of beans were slightly active yesterday, but it is difficult to expect a significant improvement in the market. Qingdao broad beans were sold at 50 packages for 232 yuan, Tianjin red beans at 20 packages for 162 yuan, and Chongming sand red beans at 30 packages for 162 yuan, with inferior goods at 156 yuan, presenting a stable situation. Buyers were selective about the price of dried sweet potatoes, showing a lack of momentum. 40 packages of dried sweet potatoes from Jiangbei were offered at 105 yuan. Wheat bran sales decreased and weakened. 250 packages of Sanshin small package wheat bran delivery notes from May were offered at 19.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Xiang Lian Trials New Several Tens of Pounds</h3>
<p>Several tens of pounds of this year's new Xiang Lian goods have been transported to the market for trial sales. Because of the small quantity, although there were offers similar to cold storage goods, it could not be regarded as the formal market. In addition, the near-market cold storage goods are very flat and weak because of few needs. Gao Zhuang is 750 yuan, and the inferior ones are different.</p>

<h3>Mother Yao's Will to Help Students</h3>
<p>— Reporter</p>
<p>After reading yesterday's report in this newspaper, "Will to Help Students," we are deeply moved that Madam Zhao, Mother Yao, even in her last moments, was concerned about saving funeral expenses to help out-of-school children. This is not only a virtuous mother of the Yao family but also a role model for great maternal education in today's society.</p>
<p>The Madam was the virtuous partner of the martyr Mr. Yao Dingsheng. After the Reform Movement of 1898, Mr. Yao invested in education and founded the Shiceng School in his hometown of Shengxian. When funding was insufficient, the Madam always donated her hairpins and jewelry to help. Later, Mr. Yao suffered misfortune in the second year of the Xuantong reign due to criticizing the Qing government. The Madam raised her children in grief, and for decades, she devoted herself to maternal education. "A mother's education is as heavy as a mountain." Now, her wise descendants have dedicated themselves to society and achieved remarkable reputations, living up to the Madam's painstaking efforts in education. When we read "The Takizuka Epitaph," we feel the same way: "Those whose hearts are rich in benevolence will surely have descendants," and "Accumulating good deeds creates virtue, and they should enjoy its prosperity."</p>
<p>We value this account not only to praise a virtuous mother but also to hope that her sincerity will inspire a positive trend in today's society: save all unnecessary expenses and help out-of-school youth. This is more urgent than any other undertaking. The Yao brothers, carrying on their mother's teachings, are also worthy of praise. This kind of righteous act is "correcting the ways of one's parents, which can be called filial piety."</p>
<p>A model virtuous mother, a model family, benefiting students, helping people and benefiting the world, not only cherishing their own relatives and children, but also enabling outstanding youth to continue their studies. In addition to our admiration, we would like to briefly express our feelings.</p>
<h3>Water and Electricity Saving Methods</h3>
<p>— Xiao Juan</p>
<p>In this era of high prices for everything, it is really not easy to be a homemaker. However, no matter how expensive things are, life must go on, so we have to save in some areas. Water and electricity bills are regular monthly expenses. Saving water and electricity can not only reduce household expenses but also conserve public resources. In a family, saving water and electricity will absolutely not cause inconvenience if done properly. Below is my experience.</p>
<p>1.  Ways to Save Water</p>
<p>Pay attention to turning water taps on and off: Recently, a new type of tap is hand-operated. When water is needed, press the lever to release water, and when not needed, release the lever to stop water. This type of tap does not have the problem of being forgotten to be closed or leaking when closed but not tightly. It is widely used in public places, but not commonly seen in ordinary households. Considering the high cost of water, homemakers may want to consult water experts to determine whether to retrofit this type of tap. This is worth considering. As for leaking taps, do not ignore them, and repair them immediately. The amount of water wasted by leaky taps can be staggering. Wash clothes in bulk: Do not wash one piece of soiled clothing, especially summer shirts and undershirts, immediately after taking it off. It is best to accumulate three to five or even a dozen pieces before washing them together. In this way, much water is saved.</p>
<p>Utilization of wastewater: The second clear water from washing clothes can be used to sprinkle the floor or wipe the floor. The remaining water from washing rice and vegetables can be used to water flowers and plants.</p>
<p>Daily savings: Usually, save as much water as possible when washing your face, hands, dishes, and vegetables. Because these are daily occurrences, even several times a day, small amounts add up. Each time you waste a little, you waste a lot in total. Conversely, each time you save a little, you save a lot in total. The so-called "saving" is not about not using what you should use but about saving on unnecessary overuse.</p>
<p>2.  Ways to Save Electricity</p>
<p>Pay attention to turning lights on and off: This is the easiest way to save electricity, but it is also the most easily overlooked. Often, the whole family goes to the dining room for dinner, but the bedroom is brightly lit even though no one is there. This is clearly an unnecessary waste. This is where the homemaker needs to be mindful. It is best to inspect the house before going to bed and see if the lights in the kitchen, bathroom, and hallway are all turned off. When using a desk lamp for reading or writing, turn it off immediately after finishing. When the radio is not in use, turn off the power.</p>
<p>Use good light bulbs: It is a waste to buy cheap and low-quality light bulbs. Old-brand light bulbs may be more expensive, but they are brighter, save electricity, and last longer. Although they are more expensive, they are worth it.</p>
<p>Use the most effective lampshade: The effectiveness of lampshades varies greatly depending on their shape, color, and material. This needs to be coordinated with the color and aesthetics of the room.</p>
<p>Attention should also be paid to the use of other electrical appliances: The voltage required for an electric bell is extremely small, so the electric meter does not run when the bell rings. A regular radio uses electricity equivalent to about fifteen candles, so it does not use much electricity. A commonly used 16-inch desktop fan uses electricity equivalent to about forty candles. Electric irons and electric stoves use more than 300 watts, consuming a lot of electricity. It is best to avoid using them or use them sparingly.</p>
<p>Finally, it is best for the homemaker to learn some common small skills such as replacing fuses and connecting wires to avoid being gouged by electricians. In short, waste is unnecessary, and this applies to everything we do. I hope everyone remembers this.</p>
<h3>One Gain From Housework</h3>
<p>— Ziqiang</p>
<p>Coffee Stains on Clothes: For clothes or tablecloths stained by tea or coffee, wet them with cold water and wait for two or three hours. Then wash them with lukewarm water and egg yolk, and the stain will disappear.</p>
<p>Removing Stains from Straw Hats: Mix sulfur powder and lemon juice into a paste, dip a hard brush into the paste and brush the hat. Then wipe it dry with a cloth and expose it to the sun, and it will look like new.</p>
<p>Removing Fruit Stains: If clothes, tablecloths, etc. are stained with fruit juice, sprinkle flour on the stain and leave it for several hours. The stain will disappear on its own.</p>
<p>Removing Ink Stains from Fan Surfaces: Grind sea foam stone on the stain, and it will disappear.</p>
<p>Removing Mold Stains from Clothes: If clothes have mold stains, dissolve one spoonful of blue vitriol and one cup of ammonia water in one spoonful of clean water. Apply the dissolved water to the mold stain and rub it. After rubbing, place it in the wind to dry. After a few hours, wash it with clean water using ordinary washing methods, and the mold stain will be removed.</p>

<h3>One Week of Home-Style Menus</h3>
<p>— Hua Ying Nu Shi</p>
<p>Recently, the prices of fish, meat, vegetables, chicken eggs, and duck eggs have soared, making people almost afraid to eat. Unexpectedly, there is one thing that is particularly cheap. What do you think it is? It is onions. If you go to the vegetable market, you can buy more than twenty large onions for just one yuan, and even thirty or forty smaller ones. Under the heavy pressure of high prices, you can't help but exclaim how cheap they are. As for cooking with onions, stir-fried beef with onions is the best dish, but if you don't have beef, you can substitute pork. In addition, stir-fried bean curd sheets with onions is also a good option. And making a soup with onions, tomatoes, and potatoes is packed with vitamins. Monday: Stir-fried shredded pork with onions, dried shrimp and egg drop soup, braised spinach with tofu, watermelon rind with soy sauce. Tuesday: Tomato beef soup, braised horse bean with pickled mustard greens, shredded chicken with bean curd sheets, loofah with gluten.

<h3>Twenty Letters from the Ge Family</h3>
<p>— Translated by Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>The Ge family letters are written by Mr. Ge Laiheng, the owner of the American Ge Laiheng Food Company, to his son, and are filled with the philosophy of life. What he says is actually what most fathers today want to say. There are a total of twenty letters, each discussing one issue. This publication will continuously publish them starting from this issue, hoping readers will pay attention.</p>
<p>The following is the first letter, sent by Mr. Ge Laiheng from Chicago when his son had just entered his freshman year at Harvard University.</p>
<p>First Letter</p>
<p>University Education, Dear Son:</p>
<p>Your mother returned home safely today, and she asked me to write you a letter urging you not to overwork yourself, but I want you to work even harder. You must know that the reason we sent you to Harvard University is so that you can receive a lot of useful education there. You will know in the future that education is the most easily obtained thing scattered everywhere here, and a person can acquire it as much as possible. Everything else is different. If you want to enjoy your share, it is not as easy as education.</p>
<p>When I was young, I didn't have such good fortune as you, but you will not have the same experiences as me either. Many people think that to know the value of money, one must earn it with their own bare hands, and some think that they should inherit fifty thousand yuan from their father and try their best to spend it. Some say that to know the truth of honesty, one only needs to do business with slippery people, while others think that one must go to Sunday school. Some say that having a drinking father can make one aware of the harm of whiskey, but others say that only a virtuous mother is needed. When it comes to education, many people think that they can gain knowledge from others, newspapers, or public libraries, while others think that it must be taught by professors. But in any case, the way to gain knowledge is not an important issue, because the form is irrelevant, like a beautiful box that is discarded after others have eaten the contents inside.</p>
<p>I hope you become a good scholar, but I hope even more that you become an upright person. If you have a pure heart when you graduate, I will not blame you even if your Latin composition has some flaws. You can get one kind of education in college, one in the classroom, and one from your classmates. In fact, the latter is more important compared to the former, because the former can only make you a scholar, while the latter can teach you how to be a person. Education is also like eating. You won't know what you eat will develop your muscles, but you can know what you eat will cause illness. So whether it is Latin, algebra, or history, you can read as much as you want, and it will never harm you. Only enjoyment and sweet things will cause you stomachache, so you should choose carefully.</p>
<p>Some people often ask, is university education worthwhile? It is worthwhile when it can promote people's thinking. It is worthwhile when it can enable a young person to answer when others are biting their pencils and unable to answer. University will not produce intelligent people, but it can cultivate intelligent people, because a foolish person is ultimately a fool, regardless of whether they study at a university or not. You must know that reading alone is useless. What I expect is that you can apply what you have learned.</p>
<p>Your Father, Ge Laiheng.</p>
<h3>The Taste of Contentment in Poverty</h3>
<p>In the previous issue, we published a dose of Refreshing Powder, which attracted considerable attention from readers. Now, Mr. Jia Gangan informs us in a letter that the article was written by Mr. Shen Zhuyu of Qiantang and is one of his "Tastes of Contentment in Poverty." The original wording is sharp and thorough, and it is indeed a valuable work. (Mr. Shen is a financial magnate in Shanghai. The regulations for the Qian industry were created by him and remain in place today. Mr. Shen has also authored medical texts such as "Zhou Yi Yi Jie" that are in circulation.) Given that the previously published version had slight differences from the original, we are reprinting it once more to share with readers. We deeply hope that you will carefully understand it and treat it as your motto. We also thank Mr. Zong.</p>
<p>Yellow vegetable leaves, stir-fried with salt, just enough to fill the belly; if one covets taste and indulges, will one not increase troubles when looking up and down?</p>
<p>Tattered patched clothes, priceless treasures, mended and patched year after year; filling boxes and chests for others to store, how many pieces can one wear until old age!</p>
<p>Hardwood bed, covered with soft straw, sleeping soundly without worries, undisturbed by dreams; brocade quilts and embroidered bedding prevent sleep, tossing and turning until the sky is light!</p>
<p>Old house, just sweep it, repair it in time so it won't collapse; how many good buildings nowadays become rubble covered with green grass!</p>
<h3>Introducing Several Nutrition Books</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Solving nutrition problems is not purely an economic issue, but an educational issue. At the recent Health and Nutrition Exhibition held by the Youth Association, special nutrition issues of the "Chinese Health Magazine" were sold for $0.20 per copy, and Dr. Hou Xiangchuan of the Shanghai Leishi Desheng Institute's "Food and Health" was sold for $0.60 per copy.</p>
<p>If readers are interested in nutrition issues, then the "Chinese Medical Journal" has books such as "What Do We Eat," "Shanghai's Food," and "Minimum Nutritional Needs of the Chinese People," which are worth buying and reading. Especially for housewives, reading them can nourish the whole family and obtain adequate nutrition.</p>
