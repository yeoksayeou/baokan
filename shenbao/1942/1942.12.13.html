<h3 id="c1">展開上海文化復與運動 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>上海本來是近代中國的文化中心，它對於中國文化上政治上的貢獻，高出於北京之上，我們硏究現代中國文化史和政治史，簡直無法把上海的文化上的勞績稍有忽視的。不過，自從中日事變以後，上海這個文化都市，便開始發生質的變化，原來集中在上海的文化人，紛粉離散，同時使中國文化，原來爲集中於大都市－尤其是上海，變爲分散於各次要城市，由中心形態變爲散佈形態，這是每一個關心國家民族命運的人士，不能不「怒焉憂之」的。遠的不說，即就大東亞戰爭爆發後一年來上海的文化界情形而言，可說很不幸的被陷於停滯的狀態了！</p>
<p>文化足以充分表現國家社會發展的程度，同時更足以推進國家社會以至整個人類社會的進發，所以，凡是國家社會政治經濟愈發達，那麼文化也就呈現燦爛輝煌的光彩，並且是不斷的活躍與前進的；所以，凡是興盛的國家，賢明的政府，沒有不盡其全力於發揚文化的工作的，因爲文化工作的發展，可以造成一種無形的潛勢力，在表　上，文化工作所表現的效果，也許不像政治經濟各項工作的明顯或迅速，可是，文化工作的效果都會在無形中造成偉大的力量，這種力量，不僅可以幫助政府推行一切良善的適合於人民要求的政策，而且還可以推進國家社會的政治經濟向更高階段發展，提高人類社會的精神生活和物質生活，創造人類遠大和幸福的理想田園。所以凡是文化進步的民族，雖然它的處境萬分艱難，可是，它們一定能够克服一切困難，而最後取得自己民族的發展。我們遍讀中外歷史，絕對找不到相反的論證！尤其是在這偉大的大東亞戰爭中，只有讓大東亞一切民族充分表現自己民族文化的前進，只有讓東亞民族先進的中日兩國互相協力推進大東亞各民族文化邁進，提高各民族的文化水準，發揮各民族的文化力量，才能貫澈國父的大亞細亞主義，才能建建大東亞各民族共　共榮平等自由的新秩序。</p>
<p>那麽，一向在中國和世界文化史上很有重要地位的上海文化界，在這偉大的新時代中，還能坐視上海文化這樣繼續停滯下云，讓一切文化事業像搖曳於風雪之中的草木一樣枯萎凋落下去嗎？同時從今日上海的當局說，對於復興上海文化的重要性一定早有充分的認識，而且自從大東亞戰爭以來，也曾經從各方面表示對於上海文化界及共過去業績愛護的誠摯並從各方面表示扶助上海文化界人士努力保持和發展文化的事業的決心，在這大東亞戰爭勝利進展，大東亞各族前途呈現出空前光芒的今日，我們史應該澈底認識復興上海文化與大東亞戰爭完全勝利的密切關係，尤其要認淸，文化停滯，文化事業不振，國家人民處於消沈沒落的逆境，不僅對於中國國運爲極大不幸而且以這種喪失自主性，自發性與積極性的人民，一定無法切實的有力地協助其盟邦，相反的，將來還會成為同盟者的一種拖累。所以我們於期望上海文化界有志人士振奮之外，同時竭誠期望上海賢明的當局，於百尺竿頭，更進一步，加意努力，以培養中國人民的文化，扶植固有的文化事業，振興新時代的文化工作，以進一步發揚上海文化而在這新時代中，克盡偉大的使命。</p>
<p>當茲大東亞戰爭進入第二年之始，政治經濟諸端，都在盡一切最大可能，期其發展，以奏最大的效果，傳聞上海日本當局，對於上海文化之復興，表示非常重視，這是十分値得欣幸的。我們爲了使中日兩國人民文化的親密關係更進一步，爲了使大東亞戰爭更澈底與完全的勝利起見，敬先對復興上海文化問題，在原則上貢獻一些意：</p>
<p>第一，中國文化，有其五千年來傳遞演進的特殊的歷史意義，在各方面不能與其他民族完全相同。所以不宜於由其他民族出而主持，過去一百年來，中國文化完全處在英美帝國主義者操縱之下，以致完全失去東亞民族尤其是中華民族的本來面目，造成了變相奴化的洋式文化，我們在這大東亞戰爭的偉大時代，使須痛改前非，首先是要使中國文化之中國化，使中國文化事業由中國人自己主持，而日本方面的熱心人士，可以處於協助的地位，根據其比較優秀的文化傳統，係中國文化復興以偉大的助力。</p>
<p>第二，關於復興文化的理論與政策，必須顧到中國人民的立塲，符合中國人民的情緒與傳統，適應中國人民的要求，而盡力使其向上和向前發展，而遂漸趨向於一致的目標－大東亞民族解放和建設平等自由的新秩序。</p>
<p>第三，文化機關，及文化事業，必須在一個文化下發展，一定要有統一的建計和執行機關，有一定的組織系統和工作步驟，在一致的理論與政策之下向前邁進。以避免力量的分散，以避免無謂的磨擦。但，同時我們必須喚起注意的是，對於各方面文化界人士的意旨，必須絕對尊重，儘量聽取各方面文化人士的意見，以收「集思廣益」之效。</p>
<p>第四，文化復興運動，不比政治經濟工作之可以求其迅速奏效，文化是百年大業，絕對不能操切從事，絕對不能拔苗助長，而要有遠大的眼光，坦蕩的懷抱，「只問耕耘，不間收穫」的精神，和「艱苦奮鬥」「百折不撓」的決心與毅力，才能眞正扶助文化的復興。也只有這樣，才眞正能够獲得迅速和廣大的功效。因爲文化的奏效，不像政治經濟工作那麼明顯，它的功效，往往不知不覺的收穫在它發展的過程中的。</p>
<p>此外我們更不能不鄭重與懇切期待的，還有兩點；第一點，在文化工作的人才方面，一定要破除成見，打破新舊，地區的界限，撤去門戶，宗派的藩籬，盡量吸收各方面的人才，斷乎不容許少數人包辦，重踏過去的覆轍。第二點，是鑒於中國文化事業的落後，尤其是技術方面的幼稚，我們熱誠期待日本當局和日本文化界人才的更大的協助。</p>
<p>爲了中日兩大民族文化的交流與融洽的合作，爲了發展中國自己的民族文化進而在中日協力下發展全亞洲各民族的文化，以實現大東亞戰爭之最後勝利與大東亞民族平等自由的新秩序之建設，我們熱烈期待上海文化復興運動的展開。</p>

<p>— 高橋司三治</p>
<p>譯自十二月十三日「星期毎日」</p>
<p>野村大使於前年出任駐美大使，對日美國交曾作種種努力，卒因美國無理的要求，努力盡歸泡影，始於今夏返抵東京。嗣後三　月，一直保持緘默的態度。値茲開戰一周年，回想當時情形，在東京澁谷的私邸，對記者作了如下的談話。</p>
<p>（問）開戰前美國警戒的情形如何？</p>
<p>（答）美國在十二月八日以前就一直在警戒著。在十一月二十六日，以最後通牒手交我政府代表的時候；態度是更加顯明了。自政府中央起，通過陸海軍長官，對委派到前方去的各司令官發了如下的指令：「日美交涉業已絕望。最近期內日美即將開戰亦未可知。對日方攻擊須作最大之警戒」云云。尤其對於逗留在夏威夷的金美爾太平洋艦隊司令官，以及旭德陸軍司令官的警戒特別嚴肅，這一點，無論在羅伯報吿書，或在其他政府的發表文中都有述及。</p>
<p>（問）但是，後來却成了那樣的結果。這是因爲小視我國國力，以致疏忽的緣故麼？</p>
<p>（答）完全是疏忽的緣故。大家都認爲日本在中國事變上已消耗了全部的實力。尤其與天之驕子的美國對敵，那簡直是不能想像的。因此，金美爾也罷，旭德也罷，雖然接到了命令，也始終那樣地想着，「日本什麼能耐也沒有」</p>
<p>（問）看了眞珠灣及其他各地我軍神速果敢的戰績，美國最初作何感想？</p>
<p>（答）看了日本初戰的勝利，敵人開始驚慌起來。後來的屢次勝利，更使美國改變了對日的即象。馬來海峽的一戰中，號稱不沉艦的「威爾斯親王號一終被擊沉，接著，菲島被奇　登陸。對這一聯串的事實，美國人開始覺悟到大難臨頭，弱一點的人甚至抱起悲觀的念頭來。並且由此達到了日本空軍不可侮的結論。</p>
<p>（問）美政府當局對初戰的敗北怎樣處置？</p>
<p>（答）政府當局自然是盡了最大的努力，他們製造種種藉口，說：眞珠灣的慘敗是因爲太疏忽的緣故，當時若稍具戒心，則日本毫不足懼。又說眞珠灣好比是在夢中被砍去了腦袋，等等。「記著眞珠灣」！一類的標語，街頭巷尼都張貼起來，在士氣鼓舞一點上，的確」盡了一切方法。以「初戰雖敗最後勝利必屬於我」，一類的話，引誘國民跟着他們走，國民也就漸漸迷溺那樣的氣氛中去了。開戰的翌日，羅斯福出席上下兩院的議會，大聲疾呼地說：「這一仗不管打得怎樣久，不獲絕對勝利，決不息兵」。除了惟一的一個婦人議員自動棄權外，這宣吿被一致通過了。由此可見美政府當局決意之　一斑。</p>
<p>（問）交涉進行中，大使的心情如何？</p>
<p>（答）我是武人出身，對政治，經濟，外交等等，不能說非常熟悉。但是正因爲武人出身，交涉中對美國的軍事戒備，倒很能推想個大槪出來。暗中進行的軍事準備固不必論，就是ABCD在謀算些什麼，商量些什麼，也大體能推知一二。我總覺得，外交與軍事是互爲表裏的，我就抱着這樣的觀念在進行着交涉。我這次的任務，跟做醫生的完全一樣的。日美間的病根在那裏，將這發見了之後，應該怎樣地予以割治：這些就是我作爲外交官的終極的任務。問題的解決是十分困難的，但是鑒於日美一向的傳統的友好關係，我並不以爲路窮途絕，我總想還有妥協的可能。在這樣的信念之下，我同來栖君一同盡了最大的努力。而且，時時要求和羅斯福，赫爾等會見，差不多到了使他們覺得囉囌的程度。但是不幸！美國用以酬報這些努力的，却是那十一月二十六日的通牒。事已至此，夫復何言！</p>
<p>（問）鑒於日本航空機的威力，以及德潛水艇將船舶擊沉的許多事實，聽說美國對自己的兵力的輕重也會有所變動……</p>
<p>（答）是的。美國對日本航空機的威力，非常驚懼。航空機能將不沉艦炸沉，這是美國從日本得到的教訓。如是而後，他們就蓄意對自己的航空力大事改革起來。特別是準備許多機材，想發明許多新東西，出其不意地予日本以打擊。這一點，我們是不可不注意的。</p>

<h3 id="c19">內地大學教授之生活 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>坪石中山大學敎授戴君之談話</p>
<p>「大學」，一向被人尊稱爲「最高學府」：「大學敎授」，無疑是有學問之學者，有經騐之專家，爲人師表，具有何等淸高尊崇之地位，則享受水準以上之生活，論理，不爲過分。</p>
<p>但自中日事變以後，尤其近兩年來內地大學敎授之生活，發生極懸殊之變化。因物價之高漲，兩年以前，敎學所得，供給食物營養之需要，已嫌不足，兩年以後，祗顧生活問題，遑論營養。其與小學敎師之生活艱苦，並無若干差異。</p>
<p>最近得晤廣東坪石中由大學敎授戴君，為述饑寒生活實况，不勝慨然。坪石地方，生活程度，本不爲高，但現時與一年前油·鹽·柴·米·之價格比較，可見敎授生活，確難維持</p>
<p>一年前　現時　增加倍數</p>
<p>（一）油每斤七角　五元六角　八</p>
<p>（二）鹽每斤一元七角　十二元　七</p>
<p>（三）柴每斤八角　四元八角　六</p>
<p>（四）米每二元六兩　九兩　四</p>
<p>油鹽·柴·米·在一年之間，增加之數，至少四倍，至多八倍，平均六倍餘，若與四年前比較，則油增加十七倍，鹽六十倍，柴十三倍，米十四倍，平均爲二十六倍，每年約增加六倍餘，　即合三十三元等於四年前一元之購買力。就學校較高薪額計，每月四百元，加上生活補助費及家屬米貼等，約共五百六十元，合四年前相當購買力之國幣不及二十五元。四年前，坪石中山大學教授中，較高月薪爲三百二十元，若以購習價值計，現在毫未加薪，而減至一成以下，以相當一成以下之薪水，而維持夫妻兒女生活，殊無可能。</p>
<p>普通生活，包括衣食住三項，衣住兩項，還可以十分節的，敝衣破屋，安之若素，惟有食物一項，節無可節，的無可的，放大肚皮固不可，緊縮肚皮亦困難。胃常以一定容積消納食物，準備身體生活之需要，並不容許有意之統制。</p>
<p>有些同事，以爲米價太昂，可以低價之馬鈴薯爲代用品，殊不知馬鈴薯煮熟後，重量不加，而米煮成熟飯後，重量增加三倍，故三斤馬鈴薯始相當於一斤米，而三斤馬鈴薯之價，比一斤米價爲高，故以馬鈴薯代米，並不經濟。有人則乾脆改乾飯爲稀粥，因煮與飯同量之粥，需米較少，而有與飯同有使胃膨脹之力。此舉胃雖可被騙一時，但不久水變爲稀薄之尿，一瀉而出，饑鐵與少食飯同，可憐亦可笑。</p>
<p>在此環境之下，極易染病，坪石地方，有誰敢擔保不染瘧疾，若遵從醫生囑咐，須服奎寗丸三週，以時價計，需費二百餘元，如一家同時一二人患溏，祗有一死。前廣東文理學院名教授張栗先生，即因缺醫藥費面死，死後尤無棺衾以葬，悽慘情事，莫此爲甚。</p>

<p>解除防空警報辦法</p>
<p>工部局情報處公告云、查關於變更防空警報信號辦法、業經日本陸海軍防空司令部於本月五日公布在案、茲查在警戒警報以後所發出之信號、（兩個長聲、每個長聲持續廿秒鐘）即爲解除警戒管制、徜此種長聲信號在空襲警報以後所發出者、其意僅空襲警報業已解除、但防空警戒辦法仍繼續存在、不因解除空襲警報之信號業已發　而告解除、</p>
<p>在實施防空辦法時、警戒警報往往一時不予解除、且在此種情形中、空襲警報與解除空襲警報之信號、得重複發出數次、市民應即注意、在發出一次以上之警報以後所　解除某次警報之信號、係屬解除所發最後一次警報之意、在另一次信號發出以前、警戒警報繼續存在、在夜間同時解除空襲警報與防空警戒警報、易於辨認、蓋其時解除空襲警報之信號、當與路燈之事開同時實行、但在空襲警報發出以後、路燈重開之時、其意並非謂防空警戒警報業已解除、總之、警戒警報必須在解除警戒警報之信號亦已發出以後方得解除也、</p>
<p>必要時間　或施封鎖</p>
<p>公共租界當局爲應付明日開始之澈底防空訓練起見、一切準備工作均已在警戒管制狀態下完成、屆時自警團員將奉派出巡各戶所備之防空設備、並組織交通隊與巡警合作、作有效交通管理、於必要時將各重要馬路予以封鎖、消防隊分佈於各重要馬路、因可能於界內之重要地區、施行縱火及燃燒彈演習、救火隊概須整裝待發、一聞警笛、當即出動、與消防隊共同擔任滅火之工作、衛生處已成玄救護隊、由衛生處內之全部職員、及醫務工作人員組織而成、分數小隊分別工作、於重要馬路處停放救護車、</p>

<h3 id="c48">有沒有竄頭 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— 川</p>
<p>做投機生意的人，相遇到一處，唯一的口頭禪，是：「有沒有竄頭？」這種口吻，我們在公共車輛上或宴會席上，常常可以聽到。</p>
<p>所謂「有竄頭」，舉個例來說，今天以一千元買進一物，不到一星期就竄到二千元或三千元。在短短的一星期之內，就可獲得凈利百分之一百或百。這種有竄頭的生意，是一般投機分子所追求的。有時候，不惜用哄詐造謠手段，造成有利於自己的空氣，而使所做生意有竄頭，獲得暴利。</p>
<p>在一般投機分子看來，上海畢竟是天堂。起初買賣外匯，黃金，棉紗。繼而囤貨，繼而買賣公債，股票。興風作浪，造謠生事，惟恐社會不亂。寗可使一般人餓死，他們却不能放棄發財的機會。兵法說「置之死地而後生」，在做投機生意的人看來，便是置大衆於死地，而後才有意可做。其心之毒，之狠，雖比之豺狼，也不爲　。</p>
<p>因爲少數分子做了有竄頭生意，　得暴利，於是）般小資產者也都盲從，推波助瀾，以致火上加油；投機之風，一發不可收拾。</p>
<p>要根除投機之風，我們以爲：第一，盡量使物資的供求相應。第二，不給他們造成有竄頭的形勢；如果竄了，立刻予以嚴厲抑止：第三，使游資有正當的去路　第二，做投機生意的大戶，究竟是少數人。與其使上　最大多數人哭，不如使少數　戶不笑。擒賊擒王的戰略，同樣有效地適用於對付一般投機分子。</p>
<h3 id="c49">閒話買辦 <a href="#c49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— 非</p>
<p>上海人一談到買辦，　聯想到汽車洋房，以至聲色犬馬；因為做了買辦，就會發大財。</p>
<p>買辦的定　是　外人初入中國通商時，所僱傭的採買人或管事人。到近世便成爲外國商行華經理的通名。他的職務是代外國商人與中國人進行貿易。</p>
<p>姚公鶴著上海閒話，關於買辦，有云；</p>
<p>一買辦之名稱胡解者？此於商法上實無確當之意義。蓋吾國海通後租界上之一種特別職業也。英文譯音爲糠擺　。咸同間名人等筆記，不曉譯音之不可索解，乃就糠擺渡三字以中國文字爲之解釋。謂買辦介於華洋人之間，以成交易，猶藉糠片爲擺渡之用。」</p>
<p>姚先生對於此種態度，不予贊同，說：一旣以居間業許之，而又含有輕誚之詞。此實從前仇視外人，因並鄙夷代外人介紹商業之華人之常態，作爲未開化論，可也！」</p>
<p>實在，在咸同間，不僅守舊份子輕視買辦，就是有識之士，也不屑就買辦之職。戲國留美學生老　輩容閎先生，在所著西學東漸記裏，說、</p>
<p>「予因曾繼甫旋識寳順公司之西經理。經理遇予頗厚，欲命予至日本長崎爲其分公司之買辦。時日本與各國通商，尚未久也。（按　日本於一八五四年與美英俄訂約通商、）予則婉辭不就此職，且實告以故，謂買辦之俸雖優，然操業近卑鄙。予固美國領袖學校之畢業生故予極重視母校，尊之敬之，不敢使予之所爲，於母校之名譽，少有辱沒·以買辦之身分，不過洋行中奴隸之首領耳！以予而爲洋行中奴隸之首領，則使予之母校及諸同學聞之，對予將生如何之感情耶？」</p>
<p>寳順公司的經理，聽了容先生這番話，評說：「容某雖貧傲骨殊稜稜，天下貧骨之與傲骨，乃往往長相伴而小相離也！」</p>
<p>容先生於公元一八五四年（前濟咸豐四年）畢業於美國第一流大學——耶魯大學。他婉辭買辦，大約時在一八五八年。</p>

<p>— 岩雲</p>
<p>小學敎師生活的困苦，在今日已爲世人所公認。因此，一般人對於這個神聖的　業，都望而却步，感不到　味。其實這種見解是不正確的。</p>
<p>誠然，小學敎師在物質家受上是跟不上人家的，但精神上的收穫，却非局外人所能領會。例如、當你看到一手栽培的學生，成績天天進步：當你看到他們修完了學程，一羣聚長成了，羽毛漸豐，離開了你而遠走高飛，你的心雲上便得到無上的安慰。這安慰是勝過了農夫的豐收，勝過了商人的厚利。</p>
<p>不僅如此，每個大　無邪的孩子，都具有一顆然誠的小心兒如果你小妄自尊大，投身在他們的中間，關懷他們的生活，他們也能幫助你塡補物質上的缺憾。別人不談，單　筆者自身來說吧。當　年他們發現我的棉袍破舊不堪時，便偷偷地合買了一件面子送給我。雖然自己再三辭謝，可是終究却不下他們的好意，收受下來。最近自己病倒了，更忙壞了他們。一下課，便跑到寢室來探問，並且，凑了八十多塊錢，替我延醫療治，並酬謝代課敎師。諸如此類的事，如果換一個職業，別說實地享受，怕連做夢也不會有的吧！</p>
<p>只要你認眞服務，熱心敎導，誰說敎師不可爲呢？</p>

<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>一一　仇家</p>
<p>兩人向客棧裏說了聲，就走到外邊來。在客堂似的一間裏，看見有二三十個人圍了桌子在呼盧喝雉，他們也不去注意。到了街上，維城道：我是輕車駕熟路了，我來引導你。維城閃在前面，一脚高一脚低的走着，黃龍把一枝手電筒掏出來亮了亮，照着維城走路。維城道：「你把電光一晃一晃的，倒把我的眼睛弄花了，還是讓我定一定神暗中摸索吧。一走了一回，維城憑着記憶力，摸索陳國芳家門前了。是矮矮的平房沒有錯：門前有兩株人楡樹沒有錯。上了階石，摸索着大門已是關了。維城舉起拳頭來化門上敲了兩下，雖不是　谷傳聲，在鄉鎭裏，爲了門前空曠，遠遠的也有回聲。裏邊有人來問道：「敲那一家的門。」維城道：「我是花　葉家，來找陳家少爺小姐的。」裏邊先應了一聲，來開了門。這就用得着黃龍手裏的電筒，照一照，維城認出是陳家僱用多年的老媽子。他父告訴了她，說是花港世　堂葉家。</p>
<p>老媽子有些詫異雜城的忽然駕臨，把維城和黃龍，請到裏邊，還是西廂那一間。是黯淡的燈光下，瞧　陳老太太躺在一張鋪了西狗皮的藤椅上，相隔得沒多少時候，老人家憔悴得不成個樣子了。她喘着，咳一聲，老媽了忙把一個拳頭　的瓷痰盂讓她吐痰。陳老太太一邊吐痰　一邊圓睜着枯澀的眼光，一邊向維　點　頭。維城走上前一步，喚道：「太伯母，你的身體還好嗎？」陳老太太點點頭。她把手擺了一擺，意思是要他們坐下。維城道：「我們冒昧得很，到了晚上才來拜訪太伯母。國器國芳，年假都沒回來嗎？」陳老太太搖搖頭。維城道：「我們早就要來的，為的繞道繞到蟻墩鎭，到這裏來才晚了。（二四一）</p>

<p>前馬來英陸軍司令　帕雪維爾將軍手記</p>
<p>更進，因爲開達及苦錄戰綫間有被敵軍中央突破的危險性，乃作如次的決定：</p>
<p>（一）使總預備隊身份之印度第十二步兵旅團北上至威爾斯利地區，使轄人印度第三軍國指揮之下。</p>
<p>（二）即使是少數部隊，爲了儘可能使之在開達洲方面作戰，必須立刻放棄丕南之防禦。不特此也，日軍旣主要的把戰鬥機配　在南太一帶，馬來半島北部地方就可確保航空勢力的絕對優勢。因此，縱然日軍對丕南那樣毫無對空防禦」的地點加以襲擊，甚至對我軍移動加以監視，我們也仍得攪亂其交通連絡。</p>
<p>向　　一丕拉一之後退</p>
<p>得到印度步兵第十二旅團之援助，完成了開　與古錄兩地區間之聯絡。到十二月十八日止，該陣地一直保持在古良河的一綫。但即使在那時，印度第十一師團也已蒙受相當損失，而漸次弱化了。另一方面，小分遣隊則仍保持古里克山道。</p>
<p>這地點，因爲攻擊只能局限於比較的狹小面之故，可以說是北部丕拉最良好的陣地。不幸，由於敵軍向在里克山道節節進擊，該地我軍有與泰賓地區所在部隊遮斷的危險，該地的守備不久也告瓦解。由此，更進一步，父不得不後退至丕拉河以東的陣地。這一陣地，絕非天然的好陣地，又因本道與河流並行之故，在本道上的軍通信連絡機關等，遂常時受到企圖丕拉河渡河的日軍的攻擊。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Unfolding the Shanghai Cultural Renaissance Movement <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai was originally the cultural center of modern China. Its contributions to Chinese culture and politics were higher than those of Beijing. We, in studying modern Chinese cultural history and political history, simply cannot slightly neglect Shanghai's cultural achievements. However, since the Sino-Japanese Incident, this cultural city of Shanghai began to undergo a qualitative change. The cultural figures originally concentrated in Shanghai scattered one after another, and at the same time, Chinese culture, which was originally concentrated in large cities—especially Shanghai—became dispersed in secondary cities, changing from a central form to a scattered form. This is something that every person who cares about the fate of the nation cannot help but feel "angry and worried" about. Not to mention the distant past, even considering the situation in Shanghai's cultural circles in the year since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, it can be said that they have unfortunately fallen into a state of stagnation!</p>
<p>Culture is sufficient to fully express the degree of development of a country and society, and at the same time, it is even more sufficient to promote the advancement of the country and society, and even the entire human society. Therefore, the more developed a country's society, politics, and economy are, the more brilliant and dazzling its culture will be, and it will also be constantly active and advancing. Therefore, no prosperous country or wise government does not do its best to promote cultural work, because the development of cultural work can create an invisible potential force. On the surface, the effects manifested by cultural work may not be as obvious or rapid as those of political and economic work, but the effects of cultural work will invisibly create great power. This power can not only help the government implement all good policies that are suitable to the needs of the people, but also promote the political and economic development of the country and society to a higher stage, improve the spiritual and material lives of human society, and create the ideal pastoral of human vision and happiness. Therefore, any nation with cultural progress, even if it finds itself in an extremely difficult situation, will definitely be able to overcome all difficulties and ultimately achieve its own national development. We have read through Chinese and foreign history and can absolutely not find any opposing arguments! Especially in this great Greater East Asia War, only by allowing all the nations of Greater East Asia to fully express the progress of their own national cultures, and only by allowing the two advanced countries of China and Japan in East Asia to cooperate with each other to promote the advancement of the cultures of all the nations of Greater East Asia, raise the cultural standards of all nations, and give full play to the cultural strengths of all nations, can we implement Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism and build a new order of co-existence, co-prosperity, equality and freedom for all the nations of Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>Then, can Shanghai's cultural circles, which have always held a very important position in the cultural history of China and the world, in this great new era, still sit idly by and watch Shanghai's culture continue to stagnate in this way, allowing all cultural undertakings to wither and fall like grass and trees swaying in the wind and snow? At the same time, from the perspective of the current authorities in Shanghai, they must have a full understanding of the importance of revitalizing Shanghai's culture. Moreover, since the Greater East Asia War, they have also expressed their sincere care for Shanghai's cultural circles and their past achievements from all aspects, and have also expressed their determination to assist people in Shanghai's cultural circles to strive to maintain and develop cultural undertakings from all aspects. In today's situation where the Greater East Asia War is progressing victoriously and the future of all the nations of Greater East Asia is showing unprecedented brilliance, we must thoroughly recognize the close relationship between the revitalization of Shanghai's culture and the complete victory of the Greater East Asia War. In particular, we must recognize that cultural stagnation and the lack of vigor in cultural undertakings will place the country and its people in an adverse situation of decline and decline, which is not only an extreme misfortune for China's national fortune, but also with a people who have lost their autonomy, spontaneity, and initiative, they will definitely not be able to effectively and powerfully assist their allies. On the contrary, they will become a burden to their allies in the future. Therefore, in addition to hoping that people of ambition in Shanghai's cultural circles will be encouraged, we also sincerely hope that the wise authorities in Shanghai will go a step further and make greater efforts to cultivate the culture of the Chinese people, support the inherent cultural undertakings, and revitalize the cultural work of the new era, in order to further promote Shanghai's culture and fulfill its great mission in this new era.</p>
<p>As the Greater East Asia War enters its second year, all aspects of politics and economy are doing everything possible to develop in order to achieve the greatest effect. It is rumored that the Japanese authorities in Shanghai attach great importance to the revival of Shanghai's culture, which is very gratifying. In order to further enhance the close relationship between the cultures of the Chinese and Japanese peoples, and in order to achieve a more thorough and complete victory in the Greater East Asia War, we would like to first offer some suggestions on the principle of revitalizing Shanghai's culture:</p>
<p>First, Chinese culture has its own special historical significance of transmission and evolution over the past five thousand years, and it cannot be completely the same as other ethnic groups in all aspects. Therefore, it should not be presided over by other ethnic groups. In the past hundred years, Chinese culture has been completely under the control of British and American imperialists, resulting in the complete loss of the original features of East Asian nations, especially the Chinese nation, and creating a transformed and slavish Westernized culture. In this great era of the Greater East Asia War, we must thoroughly correct our past mistakes. The first thing to do is to make Chinese culture Chinese, to have Chinese cultural undertakings presided over by the Chinese themselves, while enthusiastic people from the Japanese side can be in a position to assist, and based on their relatively excellent cultural traditions, to provide great assistance to the revival of Chinese culture.</p>
<p>Second, the theories and policies regarding cultural revival must take into account the position of the Chinese people, conform to the emotions and traditions of the Chinese people, adapt to the needs of the Chinese people, and strive to make them move upward and forward, and gradually move towards a consistent goal—the liberation of the nations of Greater East Asia and the construction of a new order of equality and freedom.</p>
<p>Third, cultural organizations and cultural undertakings must develop under a culture. There must be a unified planning and implementation agency, a certain organizational system and work steps, and move forward under a consistent theory and policy, in order to avoid the dispersion of power and to avoid unnecessary friction. However, at the same time, we must call attention to the fact that the intentions of people in all aspects of the cultural circles must be absolutely respected, and the opinions of people in all aspects of the cultural circles must be listened to as much as possible, in order to achieve the effect of "gathering ideas and benefiting from a wide range of sources."</p>
<p>Fourth, the cultural revival movement is not like political and economic work, which can seek rapid results. Culture is a century-long undertaking, and it must never be engaged in hastily, and it must never be forced to grow. Instead, it must have a long-term vision, an open mind, a spirit of "only asking about cultivation, not asking about the harvest," and a determination and perseverance of "hard struggle" and "unyielding in the face of setbacks" in order to truly support the revival of culture. Only in this way can we truly achieve rapid and widespread results. Because the effectiveness of culture is not as obvious as that of political and economic work, its effectiveness is often unconsciously harvested in the process of its development.</p>
<p>In addition, there are two points that we cannot but solemnly and earnestly expect: The first point is that in terms of talent for cultural work, we must eliminate prejudices, break down the boundaries between the new and the old and regions, remove the barriers of factions and sects, and absorb talent from all aspects as much as possible. We absolutely cannot allow a small number of people to monopolize it and repeat the mistakes of the past. The second point is that in view of the backwardness of Chinese cultural undertakings, especially the immaturity of technology, we sincerely expect greater assistance from the Japanese authorities and Japanese cultural talents.</p>
<p>For the sake of the exchange and harmonious cooperation between the cultures of the two great nations of China and Japan, for the sake of the development of China's own national culture, and then, with the cooperation of China and Japan, for the sake of the development of the cultures of all the nations of Asia, in order to realize the final victory of the Greater East Asia War and the construction of a new order of equality and freedom for the nations of Greater East Asia, we are eagerly awaiting the unfolding of the Shanghai Cultural Renaissance Movement.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Heads of State of Germany and Italy Greet the Japanese Emperor Separately Berlin Publishes Current War Situation Anti-Axis Forces Have Fallen into Difficulties <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) The German Head of State's official residence issued a communique on the 11th, stating that, in celebration of the anniversary of the establishment of the military alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy, Head of State Hitler sent a telegram to the Japanese Emperor expressing his congratulations, and at the same time sent letters to Italian Emperor Emmanuel III and Prime Minister Mussolini to express his congratulations.</p>
<p>Rome, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) The Italian Ministry of Interior announced on the 11th that, on the occasion of the anniversary of the Italian government's entry into the war, Italy, in order to express its congratulations, had Emperor Emmanuel send a telegram to the Japanese Emperor, and at the same time sent a letter to German Head of State Hitler to express his congratulations. In addition, Prime Minister Mussolini and Head of State Hitler, and Foreign Minister Ciano and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, also exchanged congratulatory letters.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) The German military headquarters and military order authorities, in commemoration of the first anniversary of the declaration of war against Britain and the United States by Japan, Germany, and Italy, issued opinions on the current war situation on the 11th as follows: (1) After the Japanese government entered the war, the European war expanded into a world war, and the joint operations of the three countries can serve as a model for future war history. (2) Before the start of this war, Japan, Germany, and Italy had some difficulties with raw materials and food. However, now, due to the development of the war situation, these difficulties have not only been overcome, but the anti-Axis forces have fallen into the predicament of insufficient ships and difficult transportation. (3) The US government has made great publicity about the construction of new ships, but as a result of the Axis forces' implementation of trade disruption warfare, the anti-Axis forces have no choice but to succumb. Their operations in French North Africa have allowed the Axis forces to conduct overseas expeditions, which is quite welcome.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Domei News Agency Telegram) Japanese Prime Minister Tojo's conversation with reporters from Germany and Italy on the 9th of this month has generated a good impression among the German people. German newspapers have published it prominently on the front page, with commentary. The Nazi Party's organ newspaper, the "Völkischer Beobachter," published Prime Minister Tojo's remarks as prominently as it published Mussolini's speech a few days ago. The German people are most interested in three points of Prime Minister Tojo's remarks: (1) Japan's war aims are not entirely material, but spiritual. (2) The Greater East Asia War and the European War are one entity, and Japan, Germany, and Italy must strengthen their unity. (3) Japan has an unwavering belief in the victory of the Axis powers.</p>
<p>German and Italian Foreign Ministers' Speeches Highly Praise the Great Achievements of the Japanese Army</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Domei News Agency Telegram) German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop yesterday, on the anniversary of the signing of the alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy and the declaration of war against Britain and the United States, broadcast to Japan, Germany, and Italy, highly praising the glorious victories of the Japanese navy, army, and air force in the past year. He said that the unity of the three nations and their allies gives them the will and determination to sacrifice themselves for their countries and gives them the belief in final victory. At this point, Japan has driven Britain and the United States out of East Asia, and the Japanese navy is still striking at the US navy, making it unable to take the offensive for a considerable period of time. Rome, 12th (Havas News Agency Telegram) Italian Foreign Minister Ciano issued a radio speech yesterday, stating that the Japanese soldiers have made great progress in this year and have fully destroyed the enemy's invasion strongholds. The great achievements of the Japanese army in the land, sea and air can be admired by the world and are respected by us. We still remember the Three-Power Pact signed in Berlin on September 27, 1940, which was not aimed at anyone, threatening anyone or challenging anyone. Its purpose was only to protect the interests of the countries of the Three-Power Pact. However, Britain and the United States did not understand and created the East Asian War. However, Britain and the United States have suffered disastrous defeats in the East Asian, Pacific, European and Atlantic wars. This is a fact that is universally recognized and does not need to be elaborated on. Japan is now responding to Germany and Italy in East Asia and Europe and Africa. In view of the war achievements in the past year, it will surely give the enemy a major blow. The Italian soldiers are also determined to fight to the final victory.</p>

<h3 id="e4">Southwest of Bizerte, North Africa Axis Forces Launch Fierce Attack Allied Forces Forced to Withdraw from Coastal Areas Only Minor Contact on Libyan Front <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>German Head of State Headquarters, 12th (Havas News Agency Telegram) This afternoon's German military report stated that, in the direction of Cyrenaica, British tank convoys once attempted a raid, but retreated without success. Our fighter planes and anti-aircraft guns shot down eight invading British and American military aircraft. German and Italian troops in Tunisia continued their offensive. Enemy troops defending the bridgehead south of Medjez el Bab have been wiped out. The enemy's supply port in Algeria is bombed day and night. Port facilities and ships in the port have been hit repeatedly. A German submarine sank an American destroyer near Oran.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) According to news from here, Axis armored groups launched a fierce attack against the anti-Axis forces near Medjez el Bab, southwest of Bizerte, on the 11th. Another armored group, assisted by infantry units, continued south along the Mejerda River.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 11th (Havas News Agency Telegram) According to observations from Berlin, the North African war situation is gradually becoming favorable to the Axis powers. The German and Italian allied forces have gained absolute air superiority and are preventing the activities of British and American troops in the vicinity of the front line. At the same time, after the German army captured the city of Tebourba in Tunisia, it continued to advance. The British and American allied positions in northern Tunisia have felt a decisive threat. Also, the US military headquarters admitted the German army's progress in Tunisia. According to British and American war reports, the German army has transferred two units to attack Medjez el Bab, about 20 miles southwest of Tebourba, on the railway. The British allied forces immediately counterattacked. Also, a Reuters correspondent accompanying the troops in North Africa reported that the German forces in southern Tunisia have greatly increased. At least twelve Junkers 52 aircraft are landing soldiers every day. The total number of German soldiers in the area now reaches at least 28,000.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Havas News Agency Telegram) The Axis forces in Tunisia have crossed Tebourba and advanced southwest, forcing the Allied forces to withdraw from the coastal areas. The rainy season in French North Africa will last until the end of April, especially the rain in northern Tunisia. Therefore, the Allied forces' military action did not gain the advantage of favorable weather.</p>
<p>Tangier, 12th (Havas News Agency Telegram) The headquarters of the British First Army revealed that the Allied forces in Tunisia have completed their withdrawal. The Allied forces' line has been shortened by 50 to 60 kilometers. German and Italian troops have advanced 30 kilometers in the Tebarka and Mateur areas. Reports from all sides say that Axis aircraft still outnumber the Allied aircraft. General Eisenhower must wait until the number of Allied aircraft increases before he plans to launch another offensive. Generally speaking, there have been no major changes in the past two days.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 12th (Havas News Agency Telegram) London Radio reported yesterday that the British Eighth Army had another tank battle with the Axis forces near Tebourba. The Allied forces' military operations are clearly not as smooth as expected and have now retreated from the offensive to the defensive.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 11th (Havas News Agency Telegram) According to a war report released by the British Middle East Command in Cairo, there was little fighting on the Libyan front yesterday. There was only scout contact between the two sides near the El Agheila area.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Havas News Agency Telegram) Well-informed sources here say that the first result of the talks between British Prime Minister Churchill and South African Prime Minister Smuts is the appearance of South African troops on the Tunisian battlefield. It is said that 10,000 to 12,000 South African troops are preparing to depart within days. As for the South African people, they cannot help but feel unhappy about this. The opinions of Britain, South Africa, and the United States on military and political activities in Tunisia are also not consistent.</p>

The enemy southeast of Toropets also lost 36 tanks. Our army is progressing smoothly. Several enemy divisions that were surrounded have been forced by our army to retreat into a small area.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 12th (Havas News Agency Telegram) Sources in London revealed that Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky has visited Foreign Minister Eden three times in a week, requesting intensified assistance with war materials and the establishment of a second front. According to Maisky, the Soviet government originally hoped that the Allied forces' actions in North Africa could save the precarious situation in Eastern Europe. However, as of today, the situation has not improved, so he has had to raise the urgent request to open a second front again. It is reported that Maisky has asked Eden to raise this matter for discussion at Thursday's secret meeting of the House of Commons.</p>

<p>Bengbu, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) The Anhui Provincial Security Authorities previously divided the counties and districts of the province into nine districts in the 29th year of the Republic and implemented joint defense. Local security relied on this foundation. Later, Lixian County and other counties were placed under the jurisdiction of the Su-Zhun Special District, which prevented the continuation of the implementation. It is now known that the provincial government authorities have restored the administration of Dongliu County and other six counties. In the first half of this year, two special districts, Datong and Xiatangji, were established. Therefore, joint defense should continue to be implemented and needs to be strengthened.

<h3 id="e18">Ambassador Nomura's Reminiscences Before and After the Start of the War (Part 1) <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— Takahashi Simaji</p>
<p>Translated from the December 13th issue of "Weekly Mainichi"</p>
<p>Ambassador Nomura took office as the ambassador to the United States two years ago and made various efforts to improve Japanese-American relations. However, due to unreasonable demands from the United States, his efforts were in vain. He returned to Tokyo this summer. For three months afterwards, he maintained an attitude of silence. On the occasion of the first anniversary of the start of the war, recalling the situation at the time, he gave the following interview to reporters at his private residence in Shibuya, Tokyo.</p>
<p>(Question) What was the state of American alert before the war?</p>
<p>(Answer) The United States had been on alert since before December 8th. The attitude became even clearer on November 26th, when the ultimatum was handed to the representatives of my government. From the central government, through the army and navy chiefs, the following instructions were issued to the commanders assigned to the front lines: "Japanese-American negotiations have reached a dead end. It is possible that Japan and the United States will go to war in the near future. Maximum alert must be maintained against Japanese attacks." In particular, the commanders of the Pacific Fleet, Kimmel, stationed in Hawaii, and the Army Commander Short, were placed on especially high alert. This point is mentioned in the Roberts Report and in other government publications.</p>
<p>(Question) But, in the end, it turned out the way it did. Was this due to underestimating our national power and therefore being negligent?</p>
<p>(Answer) It was entirely due to negligence. Everyone believed that Japan had exhausted all its strength in the China Incident. Especially to be enemies with the darlings of fate, the Americans, was simply unimaginable. Therefore, both Kimmel and Short, although they received orders, always thought, "Japan has no ability."</p>
<p>(Question) After seeing the rapid and decisive victories of our army in Pearl Harbor and other places, what were the initial impressions of the United States?</p>
<p>(Answer) After seeing Japan's initial victories, the enemy began to panic. The subsequent repeated victories further changed America's perception of Japan. In the Battle of the Malayan Strait, the "Prince of Wales," which was known as an unsinkable battleship, was sunk. Then, landings were made in the Philippines. Faced with this series of events, Americans began to realize that a great disaster was imminent, and the weaker ones even began to have pessimistic thoughts. This led to the conclusion that the Japanese air force could not be insulted.</p>
<p>(Question) How did the American government deal with the initial defeat?</p>
<p>(Answer) The government authorities naturally made their best efforts. They fabricated various excuses, saying that the Pearl Harbor debacle was due to too much negligence, and that if they had been a little more cautious, Japan would not have been a threat. They also said that Pearl Harbor was like having your head chopped off in a dream, and so on. Slogans such as "Remember Pearl Harbor!" were posted everywhere, doing everything possible to boost morale. Using words like "Although we lost the initial battle, final victory will surely belong to us," they lured the people to follow them, and the people gradually became immersed in that atmosphere. The day after the start of the war, Roosevelt attended a joint session of the two houses of Congress and loudly declared, "No matter how long this battle lasts, we will not cease fighting until we achieve absolute victory." With the exception of one female legislator who abstained, this declaration was unanimously passed. This shows the resolve of the American government.</p>
<p>(Question) How did the ambassador feel during the negotiations?</p>
<p>(Answer) I am from a military background, and I cannot say that I am very familiar with politics, economics, diplomacy, and so on. However, precisely because I am from a military background, I was able to infer a great deal about the military preparedness of the United States during the negotiations. Leaving aside the military preparations being carried out in secret, I could also roughly know what the ABCD powers were planning and discussing. I always felt that diplomacy and military affairs are two sides of the same coin, and I was conducting negotiations with this in mind. My mission this time was exactly like that of a doctor. My ultimate task as a diplomat was to find out where the root of the disease was between Japan and the United States and how to cure it. Solving the problem was very difficult, but given the traditional friendly relationship between Japan and the United States, I did not think that the road was at a dead end, and I always thought that there was still a possibility of compromise. With this belief, I and Mr. Kurusu made our best efforts. Moreover, I constantly requested meetings with Roosevelt, Hull, and others, almost to the point where they found it annoying. But unfortunately! The reward that the United States gave for these efforts was that ultimatum on November 26th. Now that things have come to this, what more can be said!</p>
<p>(Question) Given the power of Japanese aircraft and the many facts that German submarines have sunk ships, I hear that the United States has also made some changes in the emphasis of its military strength…</p>
<p>(Answer) Yes. The United States is very frightened by the power of Japanese aircraft. The fact that aircraft can sink unsinkable battleships is a lesson that the United States has learned from Japan. After that, they have deliberately made major reforms in their air power. In particular, they are preparing many materials and want to invent many new things to unexpectedly strike Japan. This is something we must pay attention to.</p>

<h3 id="e19">The Life of University Professors in the Interior <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Talk by Professor Dai Jun of Zhongshan University in Pingshi</p>
<p>"University" has always been respectfully referred to as the "highest institution of learning." "University professors" are undoubtedly scholars with knowledge and experts with experience. As models for students, they hold such a noble and respected position that enjoying a higher-than-average standard of living is, in theory, not excessive.</p>
<p>However, since the Sino-Japanese War, especially in the last two years, the lives of university professors in the interior have undergone extremely disparate changes. Due to the high rise in prices, two years ago, the income from teaching was barely enough to meet the nutritional needs of food. Two years later, they are only concerned with survival, let alone nutrition. There is not much difference between their hardship and that of elementary school teachers.</p>
<p>Recently, I had the opportunity to meet Professor Dai Jun of Zhongshan University in Pingshi, Guangdong, who described the reality of a life of hunger and cold, which filled me with emotion. The cost of living in Pingshi was originally not high, but comparing the current prices of oil, salt, firewood, and rice with those of a year ago shows that the lives of professors are indeed difficult to maintain.</p>
<p>One year ago    Current  Multiple Increase</p>
<p>(1) Oil per catty 7 jiao  5.6 yuan   8</p>
<p>(2) Salt per catty 1.7 yuan   12 yuan  7</p>
<p>(3) Firewood per catty 8 jiao  4.8 yuan   6</p>
<p>(4) Rice per 2.6 yuan  9 yuan  4</p>
<p>The increase in the price of oil, salt, firewood, and rice in one year is at least four times and at most eight times, averaging more than six times. Compared with four years ago, oil has increased seventeen times, salt sixty times, firewood thirteen times, and rice fourteen times, averaging twenty-six times. That is, 33 yuan is equivalent to the purchasing power of one yuan four years ago. Considering the higher salaries in schools, a monthly salary of 400 yuan, plus living allowances and rice subsidies for family members, amounts to about 560 yuan, which is equivalent to less than 25 yuan in purchasing power four years ago. Four years ago, the higher monthly salary among professors at Zhongshan University in Pingshi was 320 yuan. In terms of purchasing value, there has been no salary increase now, and it has decreased to less than 10%. It is simply impossible to maintain the lives of a husband, wife, and children with a salary equivalent to less than 10%.</p>
<p>Ordinary life includes clothing, food, and shelter. Clothing and shelter can be very frugal. Worn-out clothes and dilapidated houses are tolerated, but only food cannot be reduced further. It is difficult to reduce further. It is impossible to eat one's fill, and it is also difficult to tighten one's belt. The stomach always digests food with a certain volume, preparing for the body's needs, and does not allow for intentional control.</p>
<p>Some colleagues believe that rice is too expensive and can be replaced with cheaper potatoes. However, after potatoes are cooked, their weight does not increase, while rice increases three times in weight after being cooked into rice. Therefore, three catties of potatoes are equivalent to one catty of rice, and the price of three catties of potatoes is higher than the price of one catty of rice. Therefore, it is not economical to replace rice with potatoes. Some people simply change from dry rice to thin congee, because cooking the same amount of congee as rice requires less rice and has the same ability to inflate the stomach. Although the stomach can be fooled for a while, the water soon turns into thin urine, which is excreted, and hunger is the same as eating less rice, which is pitiful and laughable.</p>
<p>In this environment, it is very easy to get sick. Who dares to guarantee that they will not get malaria in Pingshi? If you follow the doctor's instructions, you need to take quinine pills for three weeks, which costs more than 200 yuan at current prices. If one or two people in a family get sick at the same time, there is only one outcome: death. Mr. Zhang Li, a famous professor at the former Guangdong College of Arts and Sciences, died due to a lack of medical expenses. After his death, he did not even have a coffin for burial. There could be no more tragic situation than this.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Precautions During Air Raid Drills: Distinguishing Alarm Signals, Air Raid Alarms May Be Repeatedly Issued, Street Lights Reopened Does Not Mean the End of Air Defense <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>The city's highest air defense authorities, in order to promote the public's training in air defense, have decided to hold another full-scale air defense drill for ten days. The progress of the drill will be signaled by alarms: a long tone for the alert alarm, lasting for 30 seconds; several short tones for the air raid alarm, each lasting for 5 seconds; two long tones for the alarm's end, each lasting for 20 seconds. Residents should be prepared at all times to listen for alarms and, under the guidance of neighborhood chiefs and self-defense corps, undertake the necessary measures. The authorities have strengthened the implementation mechanism. The municipal government has ordered the municipal police and the Shanghai West Police Bureau to strengthen precautions in the urban area. Because the public concession has been in a state of alert for some time, the police stations are now instructing the district chiefs to investigate the air defense equipment of each household. The French Concession previously conducted divisional air defense lighting control drills with good results. It has completed various necessary preparations for the upcoming ten-day air defense.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Issues Air Defense Guidelines</p>
<p>The city's air defense drill is scheduled to be held on the 14th of this month. In addition to the municipal police and the Shanghai West Police Bureau urging strict attention at all times in the urban area, the municipal government is issuing additional air defense guidelines to encourage citizens to pay attention, so as to be proficient and thorough. The following is a record of the citizen air defense guidelines: (1) When hearing an air raid alarm, remain calm and continue working as usual; (2) Each household should prepare air defense and fire-fighting tools in accordance with the regulations of the authorities; (3) Black covers should be added to lights to prevent light from escaping; (4) Windows and skylights should be covered with black cloth curtains to block light from escaping; (5) Households that do not burn electric lights must also implement light control; (6) Do not burn paper money or light incense candles at night; (7) Do not wander, stand, or linger on the streets to watch; (8) Pedestrians must walk on the sidewalks (if there are no sidewalks, walk on the extreme edge of the road); (9) Walk on the left side of the road; (10) Cross the road only at designated locations and do not cross any section of the road; (11) Wear white or light-colored clothes at night; (12) Cover the lens of flashlights with dark paper or paint.</p>
<p>Those Who Do Not Comply with Regulations Will Be Severely Punished</p>
<p>The Public Works Department issued a notice regarding the implementation of air defense training: "It is hereby announced that air defense training will be held in the Shanghai area starting from the 14th of this month, for a period of approximately ten days. During the implementation of air defense training, all residents of the public concession should strictly abide by the instructions issued by the authorities. The various rules stipulated in the Bureau's previous announcement No. 6115 will continue to apply to those who resist or fail to comply with the measures announced by the authorities at any time, or who repeatedly violate air defense measures, or who have actions that endanger the safety, order, and good governance of the public concession. This is specially announced for the information of all. This announcement is issued on December 12, 1942, by Director General Teraoka Kohei."</p>
<p>Measures for Lifting Air Defense Alarms</p>
<p>The Information Office of the Public Works Department announced: "The Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters have already announced changes to the air defense alarm signal measures on the 5th of this month. Now, the signal issued after the alert alarm (two long tones, each lasting 20 seconds) is the signal to lift the alert control. If this long tone signal is issued after an air raid alarm, it only means that the air raid alarm has been lifted, but the air defense alert measures will continue to exist and will not be lifted because the signal to lift the air raid alarm has been issued.</p>
<p>When implementing air defense measures, the alert alarm is often not lifted immediately. In this case, the air raid alarm and the signal to lift the air raid alarm may be repeatedly issued several times. Citizens should pay attention: the signal to lift a certain alarm that is issued after one or more alarms have been issued means that the last alarm issued has been lifted. The alert alarm continues to exist until another signal is issued. It is easy to identify when both the air raid alarm and the air defense alert alarm are lifted at the same time at night, because the signal to lift the air raid alarm will be implemented at the same time as the street lights are turned on. However, when the street lights are reopened after an air raid alarm has been issued, it does not mean that the air defense alert alarm has been lifted. In short, the alert alarm must be lifted only after the signal to lift the alert alarm has also been issued.</p>
<p>Necessary Time May Be Subject to Blockade</p>
<p>In order to cope with the thorough air defense training starting tomorrow, the authorities of the Public Concession have completed all preparations under a state of alert control. At that time, members of the Self-Defense Corps will be dispatched to patrol the air defense equipment prepared by each household, and organize traffic teams to cooperate with patrol police to carry out effective traffic management. If necessary, the important roads will be blockaded. Fire brigades are distributed on all important roads, because arson and incendiary bomb drills may be carried out in important areas within the boundary, and rescue teams must be fully equipped and ready to go. As soon as the sirens are heard, they will be dispatched immediately to jointly carry out fire extinguishing work with the fire brigade. The Health Department has established a medical rescue team, organized by all the staff in the Health Department and medical staff, and divided into small teams to work separately. Ambulances will be parked at important road locations.</p>
<p>Exercise Last Night</p>
<p>In the Public Concession of this city, a light control exercise was held after 10 o'clock last night. The French Concession also held it at the same time. After 12 o'clock, an emergency alarm was issued, and the city was blacked out.</p>

<p>Kosaku Yamada, a famous Japanese musician and composer, and the vice chairman of the Tokyo Music Culture Association, arrived in Shanghai on the 8th and will perform famous pieces in this city. Yesterday afternoon, he held a tea party for Chinese and foreign reporters on the fifth floor of the Cathay Hotel. First, the president of the Shanghai Music Association, Harazensaburo, delivered an introduction, praising Mr. Yamada for his high position in the Japanese music and culture scene. He said that he came to Shanghai this time to introduce Japanese music and to connect with the Chinese music and culture scene. Then, Yamada gave a speech, saying that genuine friendship between China and Japan must first communicate and harmonize the emotions between the people of both sides, and that harmonizing the emotions of both sides can be most effectively achieved through music and culture. With this belief, he left his country a month ago and came to China via Manchuria. He is willing to discuss with all circles in Shanghai, especially people in the music and culture circles, to promote a cultural movement centered on music, and to organize institutions that echo and connect with the Tokyo Music Culture Association, and then complete the music and culture network in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, so as to fulfill our beliefs.</p>
<p>Authorities in Both Concessions Punish a Large Number of Shops in Violation of Regulations</p>
<p>The authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession announced that all shops found to be selling goods at inflated prices or engaging in other violations of regulations have been punished. In the past two weeks, the shops punished in the two concessions are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Those Located in the Public Concession</p>
<p>In addition, there are 21 shops that have violated regulations and have been fined up to 500 yuan each or ordered to suspend business for a certain number of days. The names of the shops are omitted.</p>
<p>(2) Those Located in the French Concession</p>
<p>In addition, there are 28 shops that have been fined up to 500 yuan each for minor violations. The names of the shops are omitted.</p>

<p>After various banks and money shops undertake domestic remittance business to facilitate trade in various regions, the authorities have decided to unify and control remittances in order to stabilize finance and prevent unnecessary outflow of funds. General remittances will be restricted, large sums will require an explanation of purpose, and will be limited to peaceful areas, in order to prevent speculative merchants from remitting large amounts of funds into the interior to engage in speculative hoarding and illegal activities. However, remittances required by various industries for the purchase of agricultural products, such as cotton, wheat, rice, miscellaneous grains, etc., will not be restricted in any way, but only limited to merchants in the industry.</p>

<p>In order to supervise the active progress of various political works in the Shanghai Qingxiang District, Director Xu of the Shanghai Qing Branch Office, together with Colonel Igarashi, Deputy Minister of the Friendship Nation's Qingxiang Department, and his entourage, inspected the North Bridge and Nanhui districts in late last month and early this month. On the morning of December 10th, the Office Director still accompanied Colonel Igarashi and a group of more than ten people to continue to inspect the Nanhui Qingxiang area.

In the evening, they arrived at Datuan. On the morning of the 12th, they transferred to Xinchang to inspect the Seventh Sub-district Office. At 11:30, they arrived at Zhoupu. Zhoupu is an important stronghold in the Shanghai Qingxiang District and is the location of the Nanhui Fifth Sub-district Office. Director Xu called the trainees of the Youth Training Institute for a lecture. In the afternoon, they returned to Shanghai via Sanlintang. The car stopped specifically so that the future work arrangement could be pointed out. The entire inspection of the Shanghai Qingxiang District has now been completed.</p>

<p>The armbands of the self-defense corps in the central district of the Public Concession have been weathered by wind and sun for a long time, so it has been decided to replace all the new armbands. These new armbands have been completely made and are currently being sent to the Central Police Station for stamping. The date of their distribution should be around the middle of this month. It is heard that these new armbands are more distinct than before. The base is still white, with a bright red neighborhood badge printed in the center, and black text added above and below.

<p>Since the cessation of meetings in the public bond market, the market has disappeared in a way. However, generally people still want to sell off goods in order to obtain money for use or living. Therefore, although the market has stopped, prices are still discovered at times. However, it has become very inconvenient. Every transaction requires much trust. Only through luck can transactions be made. The sales price also cannot be determined accurately. For example, yesterday's price for Category C was around 56 yuan, Category A was still within 6 yuan, Category D was only 3.5 yuan, and Category E was around 5 yuan. At these prices, most people want to sell but cannot find buyers.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai gold shop industry's largest new trade association announced a listed exchange rate of 3,350 yuan per tael for gold ornaments at retail outlets (with a reduction of approximately 300 yuan for incoming purchases). The unofficial market price among traders initially saw transactions at 3,135 yuan, but later in the afternoon, the market strengthened. At noon, the price reached 3,170 yuan, a rise of 70 yuan compared to the previous day, fluctuating by 40 yuan or so. Transaction volume was low. The listed price for silver ornaments remained at 16 yuan per tael. Heng Fu's listed price rose by 2 yuan to 20 yuan, with inter-trader pricing at 18.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Money Trade Association's overnight loan interest rate remained unchanged at 1.4%.</p>
<p>Japanese military notes were weak and sluggish. Inter-trader pricing was 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, 3 li, and 5 hao. The spot cash price was lower. Small money shops competed with banks, offering 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, and 4 fen, 5 li as the buying price, and selling at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 6 fen.</p>

<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the cloth market, having fallen for several consecutive days, saw traders taking advantage of the low prices to gather supplies. Market sentiment turned stronger. Trading in plain white coarse cloth was minimal, and prices remained stable: 16-pound Globe cloth at 260 yuan, Flying Goose at 255 yuan, 9-pound New Character at 138 yuan, and 8-pound Zhenzhong at 133 yuan. Coarse materials were considered to be undersold. 16-pound Bumble Bee had been sold for over 280 yuan. Fine cloth rebounded by 2 to 3 yuan per bolt: Rich and Noble fine cloth at 188 yuan, Big Roc at 187 yuan, and Globe at 186 yuan, all had buyers. Peach Blossom Girl's late morning buying price was 302.5 yuan, with later transactions at 304 yuan, also rising by 2 yuan per bolt.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Market sentiment had stabilized. Traders who had registered goods were unwilling to sell them off easily, leading to short supply and high demand. Prices gradually climbed higher. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth's new order price was 192.5 yuan, bank order price was 192 yuan, Colorful Ball at 193.5 yuan, Flying Fish at 192.5 yuan, Yang Crane at 191 yuan, and Five Blessings at 190.5 yuan, all rebounding by 1 to 1.5 yuan. Four Gentlemen broadcloth's red order started at 7 yuan, 5 jiao, and 8 fen, rising to 7 yuan, 6 jiao, and 8 fen, also increasing by 9 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Overcoats: In Season and Selling Well <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Overcoats are currently in their prime selling season. Although traveling merchants had already purchased ample supplies, there is still significant demand within the city. This is due to the cold weather and the high prices of Western-style clothing. Consequently, merchants are buying as they sell, with sporadic purchases from domestic suppliers. Actual sales have been robust recently, and the retail sales at the shops on Chessboard Street are also strong. Therefore, prices for all types of overcoat fabrics are firm and strong. Although not as wildly inflated as mainstream goods in spring and summer, the selling price per yard has still increased by 8 to 10 yuan. Yesterday, the current wholesale price for Meifeng overcoat fabric, with all yardages available, was 375 yuan. Shanghai Yarn Factory's 261 was 350 yuan, Public Great Old style was 250 yuan, New style was 190 yuan, Three Number Gray Robbery was 160 yuan, and our factory's Yuan Cang Weiza overcoat fabric was 120 to 160 yuan.</p>

<p>The supply and demand for miscellaneous grains were scarce yesterday, but bean cakes have become a staple food for some impoverished people, leading to better sales. Market sentiment rebounded. Three carts of Fertilizer Character bean cakes were priced at 78 to 78.5 yuan. One cart of Yuanlong bean cakes was priced at 78 yuan. A dozen or so packages of Wujiang Selected Green were priced at 305 yuan. Eight packages of Chongming New Sand Red were priced at 340 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Ordinary Longans: Soft and Weak <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Recently, ordinary longans have seen soft and weak pricing due to the reasonable prices of high-quality goods. Yesterday, a certain party offered 60 pieces, priced 150 hao lower than sun-dried goods, but there were few takers. The quality of the goods was considered relatively soft, but the color was still bright red. Buyers indicated they would only consider purchasing if the price was reduced further.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Pepper Market: Active <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>The pepper market has been quite active for several days. Listed prices have gradually tightened. The announced price for official Number One pepper has risen again by 30 to 50 hao, reaching 980 yuan. The trend is very strong.</p>

<p>Second-grade red branches have seen few new arrivals recently. Existing goods in the hands of merchants, due to cost considerations, are not willing to make price concessions, leading to few transactions. Currently, although northern merchants have a buying interest, their offers are still harsh. Yesterday, the difference between buying and selling prices in the market was 20 to 30 yuan, resulting in a stalemate and no transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Cigarettes: Cloud Road Remains Smooth, Prices Still Firm and Strong <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The cigarette market remains firm and expensive. Although British and American factories have announced shipments, due to strong buying interest from all parties, prices continue to rise.

<p>Forty-foot standard cement steel bars and three-foot or longer cement rebar head stocks: the market was scattered, so traders priced at a standstill with no real progress. Currently, prices for 40-foot standard size cement steel bars with miscellaneous patterns were offered at 11,000 yuan, 5-fen to 1-inch size at 10,000 yuan, and 3-foot or longer head stocks at 7,000 yuan to 8,000 yuan.

<p>The market for daily necessities has recently reached its highest peak, making it difficult for new speculators to enter the market.

<h3 id="e39">When Implementing Light Control, Children Should Not Go Out <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Parents Should Pay Attention</p>
<p>When light control is implemented, it is easy for children to get lost because they are not used to the dark. If they are playing enthusiastically outside on the road and suddenly it gets dark, they will be scared and run around, even running past their own front door and becoming disoriented and lost. Therefore, parents must be careful and cautious, keeping an eye on their children and not letting them play outside on the road often, especially in the evening. You should pay even more attention to whether your children are at home. Light control cannot be predicted, so you must pay attention at all times. If the lights have been turned off and the child is not yet home, then you should immediately go out and try to find them. The last time light control was implemented, several children got lost. Among them, there was a six-year-old boy named Zhang who was on the road when the lights suddenly went out. A bad person led him into a street hall, took off the velvet money shirt he was wearing, and left him on the road. Later, the police led him to the Children's Protection Section of the Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Public Works Department, and a social worker took him to find his home. Such things have happened, how frightening and scary. To prevent this, parents should always pay attention and not let their children be outside often, and teach their children to know their names and addresses, so if they get lost, it will be easier to find them. Parents should pay special attention to this.</p>

The additional retail tax will be suspended uniformly from November 16th of this year. However, all previous taxes must be paid in full. From now on, the purchase of materials must include tax, and it must be recorded in the account book when the materials were purchased and taxes paid, or invoices must be kept for the authorities to investigate at any time.

<h3 id="e48">Is there a "Jump"? <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Chuan</p>
<p>People who do speculative business, when they meet, their only slogan is: "Is there a 'jump'?" We often hear this kind of tone on public vehicles or at banquets.</p>
<p>The so-called "jump," for example, means buying something for 1,000 yuan today, and in less than a week it jumps to 2,000 yuan or 3,000 yuan. Within a short week, you can get a net profit of 100% or 200%. This kind of business with a "jump" is what general speculators pursue. Sometimes, they use deceptive and rumor-mongering tactics to create an atmosphere that is beneficial to themselves, so that the business they do has a "jump" and they get windfall profits.</p>
<p>In the eyes of general speculators, Shanghai is, after all, a paradise. First, they buy and sell foreign exchange, gold, and cotton yarn. Then they hoard goods, and then they buy and sell public bonds and stocks. They stir up trouble, spread rumors, and fear that society will not be in chaos. They would rather let the general public starve to death than give up the opportunity to get rich. The art of war says, "Put yourself in a dead place and then live." In the eyes of people who do speculative business, it means putting the public in a dead place, and then there is a profit to be made. Their hearts are so poisonous and cruel that they are no better than jackals and wolves.</p>
<p>Because a few people do businesses that "jump" and get windfall profits, all the petty bourgeoisie blindly follow suit, adding fuel to the fire; the speculative trend gets out of control.</p>
<p>To eradicate the speculative trend, we believe that: first, we should try to make the supply and demand of materials correspond. Second, we should not create a situation where there is a "jump"; if there is a "jump," we should immediately suppress it severely: third, we should give idle funds a proper outlet. Second, the major speculators are, after all, a small number of people. Rather than making the vast majority of people cry, it is better to make a small number of major players not laugh. The strategy of capturing the thief by capturing the king is equally effective in dealing with general speculators.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Chatting About Compradors <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— Fei</p>
<p>When Shanghainese talk about compradores, they always think of cars and Western-style houses, and even sensual pleasures; because if you become a comprador, you will become rich.</p>
<p>The definition of a comprador is the purchasing agent or manager employed by foreigners when they first came to China for trade. In modern times, it has become a general term for Chinese managers of foreign trading companies. His job is to trade with Chinese people on behalf of foreign merchants.</p>
<p>Yao Gonghe wrote in Shanghai Anecdotes, regarding compradores:</p>
<p>"Who misunderstands the name of comprador? This has no definite meaning in commercial law. It is a special profession in the concessions after the opening of our country to the sea. The English transliteration is Comprador. In the notes of famous people in the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods, they did not understand that transliteration could not be explained, so they explained the three characters Comprador in Chinese characters. It is said that the comprador is between Chinese and foreigners to complete transactions, just like using chaff to make a ferry."</p>
<p>Mr. Yao did not agree with this attitude, saying: "Once it is allowed as an intermediary industry, it also contains words of contempt. This is actually the common state of the former hostility to foreigners, because it is also contemptuous of the Chinese who introduce business on behalf of foreigners, as an uncivilized theory!"</p>
<p>In fact, in the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods, not only conservative elements looked down on compradores, but even enlightened people disdained the position of comprador. Mr. Rong Hong, a senior student studying in the United States, said in his book "A Western Education for China":</p>
<p>"I was introduced to the Western manager of the Baoshun Company by Zeng Jifu. The manager treated me very kindly and wanted me to go to Nagasaki, Japan, as a comprador for his branch company. At that time, Japan had not been trading with various countries for long. (Note: Japan signed treaties with the United States, Britain, and Russia in 1854 to open trade.) I politely declined this position and told him the reason, saying that although the salary of a comprador was generous, the occupation was almost despicable. I was a graduate of the leading school in the United States, so I attached great importance to my alma mater, respected it, and did not dare to do anything that would disgrace the reputation of my alma mater. As a comprador, I was just the leader of slaves in a foreign firm! If I were the leader of slaves in a foreign firm, what would my alma mater and classmates think of me?"</p>
<p>The manager of the Baoshun Company, after hearing Mr. Rong's words, commented: "Although Rong is poor, his proud bones are very sharp. The poor bones and proud bones of the world are often together and rarely separated!"</p>
<p>Mr. Rong graduated from Yale University, the first-class university in the United States, in 1854 (the fourth year of Xianfeng). He politely declined to be a comprador, probably around 1858.</p>
<h3 id="e50">The Real Joy of Teachers <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Yun</p>
<p>The hardship of primary school teachers' lives is now recognized by the world. Therefore, most people shy away from this sacred profession and do not feel its flavor. In fact, this view is incorrect.</p>
<p>It is true that primary school teachers cannot keep up with others in terms of material possessions, but the spiritual gains are something that outsiders cannot understand. For example, when you see the students you have cultivated making progress every day, when you see them completing their studies and growing up as a group, their feathers gradually becoming plump, leaving you and flying away, your heart will receive unparalleled comfort. This comfort is better than the farmer's harvest, better than the merchant's heavy profits.</p>
<p>Not only that, but every innocent child has a sincere little heart. If you are not arrogant and join them, care about their lives, they can also help you fill in the material shortcomings. Others don't talk about it, just take the author himself as an example. When they discovered that my cotton robe was tattered, they secretly bought a new one together and gave it to me. Although I declined repeatedly, I could not refuse their kindness and accepted it. Recently, I fell ill, and they were even busier. After class, they would run to the dormitory to ask about me, and they raised more than 80 yuan to pay for my medical treatment and thank the substitute teacher. If you changed to another profession, not to mention actually enjoying it, I'm afraid you wouldn't even dream of it!</p>
<p>As long as you serve earnestly and teach enthusiastically, who says teachers cannot be done?</p>
<h3 id="e51">Sharing the Same Boat Through Wind and Rain <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>—— Enmity</p>
<p>The two of them said a word to the inn and went outside. In a hall-like room, they saw twenty or thirty people around the table, calling out and drinking. They didn't pay attention either. When they got to the street, Weicheng said: I am familiar with the road, I will guide you. Weicheng flashed in front, walking with one foot high and one foot low. Huanglong took out a flashlight and turned it on, illuminating Weicheng's way. Weicheng said: "If you flash the light back and forth, it will blur my eyes. Let me settle my mind and grope in the dark." After walking around, Weicheng, relying on his memory, groped to the front of Chen Guofang's house. It was a low bungalow, that's right: there were two elm trees in front of the door, that's right. He stepped on the stone steps, groping for the gate, which was already closed. Weicheng raised his fist and knocked on the door twice. Although it was not 　谷传声, in the countryside, because the front of the door was empty, there were echoes from afar. Someone inside asked, "Who is knocking on whose door?" Weicheng said: "I am from the Ye family in Huag 　叶, and I am here to find the young master and young lady of the Chen family." The inside first responded, and then opened the door. This is where Huanglong's flashlight came in handy, illuminating the area. Weicheng recognized the old nanny who had been employed by the Chen family for many years. Her father told her that it was the Ye family from the Flower Port World.</p>
<p>The old nanny was a little surprised by Weicheng's sudden arrival and invited Weicheng and Huanglong inside, still to the west wing. Under the dim light, Chen old lady was lying on a rattan chair covered with western dog skin. Not much time had passed, but the old lady had become emaciated beyond recognition. She was panting, coughing, and the old nanny was busy letting her spit phlegm into a porcelain痰盂. Chen old lady was spitting phlegm while staring with her dry eyes and nodding to Wei. Weicheng took a step forward and called out, "Tai伯母, is your health still good?" Chen old lady nodded. She waved her hand, meaning for them to sit down. Weicheng said: "We are very presumptuous, coming to visit Tai伯母 in the evening. Guoyi and Guofang, didn't they come back for the New Year?" Chen old lady shook her head. Weicheng said: "We wanted to come earlier, but we detoured to Yidun Town, so we were late in getting here. (241)</p>

<p>— Memoirs of General Percival, Former Commander of the British Army in Malaya</p>
<p>Memoirs of General Percival, Former Commander of the British Army in Malaya</p>
<p>Further, due to the danger of the central breakthrough by the enemy forces between the Kedah and Kroh defense lines, the following decisions were made:</p>
<p>(1) Move the Indian 12th Infantry Brigade, which serves as the general reserve, north to the Wellesley region and place it under the command of the Indian 3rd Corps.</p>
<p>(2) Even with a small number of troops, in order to fight in the Kedah region as much as possible, the defense of Penang must be abandoned immediately. Moreover, since the Japanese army mainly deployed fighter planes in the South Pacific area, the absolute superiority of air power could be ensured in the northern part of the Malayan Peninsula. Therefore, even if the Japanese army attacks Penang, a location with "no air defense," and even monitors our troop movements, we still have to disrupt their communication and liaison.</p>
<p>Retreat towards Kuala Pilah</p>
<p>With the assistance of the Indian 12th Infantry Brigade, the connection between the Kedah and Kroh regions was completed. As of December 18th, the position was maintained along the line of the Gula River. However, even at that time, the Indian 11th Division had suffered considerable losses and was gradually weakening. On the other hand, small detachments still held the Gunung Jerai pass.</p>
<p>This location, because attacks can only be confined to a relatively narrow area, could be said to be the best position in northern Kuala Pilah. Unfortunately, due to the enemy's continuous attacks on the Gunung Jerai pass, our troops there were in danger of being cut off from the troops in the Thai-Ben area, and the defense of that area soon collapsed. As a result, we had to retreat further to the position east of the Pilah River. This position was by no means a good natural position, and because the road runs parallel to the river, military communication organs on the road were constantly attacked by Japanese troops attempting to cross the Pilah River.</p>
<p>The Retreat from Kuantan</p>
<p>In early January, the Japanese army secured complete air supremacy and maritime communication along the west coast of Malaya. Therefore, the threat to our communication and liaison increased day by day. In order to monitor the coast, we had to form special units with several artillery units to meet the urgent needs, and also moved some militia units and one or two troops from the east coast to the west. Even with the above measures, the Japanese army still forcibly landed and posed an extreme threat to our military communication and liaison, which was something we had not anticipated.</p>
<p>(Translator's note) From this, it can be seen that our naval mobile force is progressing rapidly. During the first weekend in January, the Japanese army achieved a great victory in Slim River, southern Pilah state. There, the Japanese army, using a large number of tanks, broke through our first line of two brigades, which suffered extreme damage in terms of personnel and equipment, almost to the point of collapse. Due to this battle, and the extreme attrition resulting from the continuous battles in January, the Indian 11th Division was no longer able to secure the defense position north of Kuala Lumpur. In addition, the Selangor area and its south, with its crisscrossing roads, were difficult to defend, and constantly under threat from the sea, making defense of the area increasingly difficult. Therefore, it was decided to retreat quickly to the north of the Jiuhua area, far to the rear.
