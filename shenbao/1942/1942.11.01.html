<h3>風雲變幻中之非洲</h3>
<p>前言</p>
<p>寒來暑往，天時有一定推移，東征西殺，戰塲當然也有或然的變遷，展望眼前世界大局，這「原始大陸」的非洲，正在風雲變幻之中。</p>
<p>戰塲的推移</p>
<p>目前本年五月八日，德軍在寇爾許半島發動所謂夏季攻勢，當時的確「勢如破竹，」先後佔領塞伐斯托波爾，梅谷浦，伏洛希羅夫格勒，伏朗尼慈與羅斯托夫諸要鎮，於是分兵三路，越過頓河，直撲史達林格勒，至八月中旬而衝至史城外圍綫。希特勒爲呼應東綫戰事起見，同時更於六月初間發動北非攻勢，把本來侵入里比亞的英國第八軍擊退，一路長驅直入，於六月二十日克復杜勃魯克港，二十三日攻入埃及境內，經過索倫，錫地巴拉尼，而於三十日攻陷深入埃及一百三十里的瑪薩瑪特魯港，然後又向東南推進，於七月九日佔領艾爾阿拉眠。當時英國第八軍幾乎一敗不可收拾，軍長李基蒂因此去職，幸而中東軍司令歐慶萊克收拾殘部，挽狂瀾於將倒，直到七月底，埃及戰局纔穩定下來，一時彷彿即將淪陷的亞歷山大港纔算化險爲夷。</p>
<p>希特勒在北非的作戰計劃，本想通過埃及，而和自高加索南下的征蘇軍隊，互相呼應，以期爭奪高加索和近東諸地的豐富油田，並切斷英國往來歐亞的聯絡綫，但此項計劃，一方受挫於埃及戰事的漸呈膠着，一方則因高加索的地勢險峻，使他感覺必須先攻下伏爾加河流域的史達林格勒，纔能長驅南下。可是史城一戰，整整費了兩個半月，直至今天，一座史城雖已佔其八九，但事實上時屆深秋，不但高加索山地已見冰雪，即伏爾加河面不久亦將凍結，在這一方面，雙方經過幾個月的鏖戰，既然都已感到筋疲力盡，似乎更沒有在今冬繼續廝殺的道理，至少德軍在攻下史城取得局部勝利之後，將有堅守佔領地區渡過隆冬的機會。是故多數人的推測，都以爲今後的戰塲，將和天時的遞嬗一樣，慢慢地自東綫轉移到其他更適宜於交戰的地方，而大多數的見解，都視非洲爲今多最可能的戰塲。</p>
<p>非洲的重要性</p>
<p>非洲是全世界最「無罪」的陸地，大家對它的印象，總不外是些沙漠，棕樹，金字塔，蜷髪厚　不識不知的黑人，和光怪陸離的毒蛇猛獸。它是一般人所常稱的「原始大陸」，「殖民大陸」，自有歷史以來，它衹知受人宰割，受人壓榨，自己從來沒有欺壓過人。雖然如此，但是戰禍仍舊免不了要臨到它的頭上，這是人類的悲劇，但或許這正是「進化」的定律。</p>
<p>非洲的總面積約三千萬方公里，而它的人口僅及中國三分之一，約一億四千餘萬人，平均每方公里衹有五個人，這和亞洲每方公里二十三人，歐洲每方公里四十七人，豈非相差甚遠。不過因爲地文不宜於生產，氣候又苦酷熱，內部更多沙漠，所以文化與經濟都很落後，自一八八五年柏林會議以來，它簡直成了歐洲列強瓜分的對象。</p>
<p>但是自從上次歐戰以來，非洲在經濟上政治上乃至軍事上的重要性，便漸漸地被人注意了。例如以出產而論，埃及的棉花，南非的金鑛和金剛鑽，蘇丹的　類，羅得西亞的鉻，黃金海岸的錳，以及各地所產的椰子，咖啡，象牙，駝鳥毛等，確已值得一般缺乏原料國家的垂涎。以政治而論，德國的舊屬地，被凡爾賽和約剝奪之後，當然於心不甘，而義大利又素來認定上次歐戰結束之後英法欺騙了它，所以也早已發出重新分配殖民地的呼聲，甚至這次大戰的爆發，殖民地的爭奪也正是原因之一。更就軍事觀點而論，現在交戰雙方所進行的，不但在資源上是全面戰爭即在戰綫上也早已普及全球，非洲大陸一方與歐亞兩洲銜接，一方距離南美最近之點不過二千五百公里，不論軸心國方面或協約國方面，現在都需要爭奪非洲的據點，俾可切斷對方的原料供應，打擊對方的交通綫，從而增厚本身的實力。何況，英美既正在高呼開闢第二戰塲，德義在東綫戰事進入冬季階段之後，也需要在別的方面困擾協約國，所以，不論從那一種角度來看，非洲都有逐漸被交戰雙方用作戰塲的可能。</p>
<p>最近的動態</p>
<p>以上是就形勢上，論列非洲的重要，事實上最近旬日來有關非洲的動態，也確有值得注意者在。</p>
<p>第一，沉寂了兩個多月的埃及前綫，忽又於十月廿四日，由英國第八軍（已改歸前此指揮緬甸戰事的亞力山大將軍節制）發動攻勢、號稱以十師之眾，向阿拉眠反攻。英軍並曾先後在杜勃魯克港及瑪薩瑪特魯港以東，企圖登陸，同時英國空軍則迭次轟炸義大利南部熱諾亞港，據稱目的是在阻止羅美爾將軍自歐洲取得兵員和軍械的接濟，某一天，英機甚至還去轟炸克里特島。</p>
<p>第二，英軍對法屬馬達加斯加島的軍事行動，仍在節節進逼，此島名稱上是一海島，但事實上其面積比法國本國領土還大，英國不惜觸犯昔日的盟國，而決意要佔領此橫亙於自南非通往中東航綫上的大島，當然別有打算，決非等閒可比。</p>
<p>第三，在這英美蘇三國爲了第二戰塲問題，爭論不休的今日，南非聯邦總理史默資上將（上次歐戰的名將）竟在倫敦昌言即將採取攻勢，同時還準備赴美一行。適在此際，美國軍隊復在西非的唯一獨立國里比利亞登陸，此一小國並有與軸心國絕交的傳說。剛巧法國的海陸空總司令達蘭上將，又在這時視察最最成爲問題的法屬西非達加爾港—距離巴西的伯南布哥不過兩千餘哩，他在視察之後發表談話，明言「達加爾港如遭侵略，必然全面抵抗」，而法國的海軍部長奧芳上將則又以視察該國整個艦隊所在地的都隆軍港聞。</p>
<p>介紹非洲全貌</p>
<p>觀於上述種種「非洲之戰」確乎漸漸成爲世界舞台上的重要一幕了。本報爲便利讀者參考起見，決定把非洲全貌，分篇介紹，成一有系統的專輯，其大略的分類爲：（一）獨立國，（二）法屬地，（三）英屬地，（四）義屬地，（五）西·葡·比三國屬地。獨立國僅有埃及與里比利亞兩篇，各國屬地則分自治領，直轄殖民地，保護地和代管地四種；每篇自成系統，各以一地或數地爲題，可以分讀，也可以合讀，上自政治經濟，下至風土人情，務以客觀的介紹與趣味的叙述爲原則，幸讀者諸君之注意焉。</p>

<h3>工部局具體實施　「低物價」政策　成立公會課與各業聯絡統制處長稻垣發表談話</h3>
<p>工部局物品統制處處長稻垣登、昨特向木報記者發表談話、謂『本局刻在物品統制處之下、設置「公會課」、目的在乎就物價統制及物品配給方面、與各業同業公會取得密切聯絡、使各業公會意見得能上達、而局方意見、亦有明白宣示、以免隔閡、一方面商民在營業上、倘遇任何困難、提出合理請求時、該公會課準備接受、各業公會務於十一月三十日以前、向福州路警務處第六〇七號辦公室登記、各該公會苟非向本局領照、不准設立、』</p>
<p>統制物價意義在於適當合理</p>
<p>稻垣處長繼續分析現現行局勢與物價統制之關係、　『本局實行物價統制、市民每不知其主要意義所在、今後本局將繼續採取低物價政策、務望全體市民澈底瞭解、予以協助、自去歲十二月八日以還，上海局勢與前異殊、在昔物價指數之決定、完全以自由貿易爲基礎、現則須以統制經濟爲繩準、換言之、昔者物價之標準、取決於世界全面之供求、現則僅爲東亞物資之供求所左右、就通常而言、物資豐則價廉、物資歉則價貴、物價統制非視物價　低之程度爲斷、而在乎訂定適常合理之價格也、</p>
<p>促進自動仰價盼望節制消費</p>
<p>一年以來、大半居民允以華人爲最、平日生活頗爲樸實、但另一部份則沉湎於奢侈生活、此類人士倘能减低其生活程度、以撙節主要物品之消費、自於公衆有益、當局爲安定民生起見、當努力實行低物價政策、在商人方面、應設法盡量將物價抑低、在一般市民、自須竭力節制消費、至於低物價政策如何具體實行、本人（稻垣氏自稱）認爲此非單憑法律力量所能收效、除運用法律以外、應促進商人之自動覺悟、及人民之眞誠合作、職是之故、本局現特設圍、公會課」　　各業公會取得密切聯絡、使本局與公會兩方意見、能互相明白　解、則隔　旣除、困難自免、遇事而能順利推導、自必事半功借、而商人之自動抑價、亦能逐步步實現、</p>
<p>以官司商民合作完成此項目的</p>
<p>稻垣氏最後聲稱、「來日統制物價、有賴各業公會及本局「公會課」負責人員之努力合作、商店之已加入公會者、盼共全力合作、未加入公會者、應即從速加入、因加入公會與吾與以後物資配給頗有關係、倘有商店心存觀望、遲不加入公會而企圖自由營業者、當局將予嚴厲制栽、再倘有囤積居奇、從事黑市交易、是顯爲大衆公敵、當局亦將予以嚴厲懲處、甚望全體市民、與當局眞誠合作、以達成上述目的、則幸甚矣、</p>
<h3>興亞聯合會　月中成立</h3>
<p>同盟社本埠息、上海興亞聯合會將在十一月十五日成立、此係根據昨日該會之籌備議報吿也、該會之宗旨爲推進中日間人民之合作、及孕育亞細亞文化云、</p>
<h3>衆業公所　準予復業</h3>
<p>據同盟社訊、有關當局因鑒於上海經濟界之現狀、業已漸恢復常態、故決將衆　公所（外商股票交易所）置於軍管理下、准其復業、興亞院當局特於三十一日對此發表談話稱、日軍自在上海進駐租界後、爲防止經濟界之動搖起見、曾將各種交易所概予封閉、茲經詳察最近經濟界之狀况、並顧念上海金融市塲之地位、決先將前經日軍封閉之衆業公所置於軍管理下、准其復業、興亞院因受日軍委託、故決實施嚴密監督、並准許該衆業公所以華商股票及中央地方公債等特定交易爲其主要業務、但於現狀之下、對於該公所仍有採用嚴格統制之必要、又對歷來之投機交易、亦擬充分採取嚴格抑制措置、關於衆業公所開幕之具體措置、預料即可決定、又該公所之交易員將網羅本市有力經紀人擔任之、同時對多年來類似證券交易所之非法營業、決取嚴格取締方針、</p>
<h3>情勢如果必要　將施計口授糖　零星購買店夥懶於應付</h3>
<p>本市食糖情勢、復惡什之象、消息靈通人士乃表示其意見、謂使食糖情勢迅速改善之唯一有效辦法、厥爲市政當局統制食糖分配、如果必要、將以計口授糖票發給居民矣上海糖商合作營業處雖作種種努力、然未擬定順利分配之計劃、致全市各處南貨店前、列除購糖者日　其多、此種情勢、與實施計口授糧前居民所遇之米與麵包危局相彷彿、</p>
<p>今起施行檢查</p>
<p>過去兩週來、食糖之被囤積居奇、已頗明顯、上海糖商合作營業處前日宣布、爲使食糖　勢恢復常態計、將從今日起按期檢查每月派得食糖三十餘袋之零售商營業、俾得監督食糖之零售營業、而禁絕囤積居奇、聞每月派得食糖在三十包以上之店舖、必須按日發售其派得額之三十分之一、餘者亦須報吿其每天售出額、凡查出囤積居奇者、即不復派給食糖｜上海糖商合作營業處因發現食糖匱乏、乃因店主操縱所致、遂決定統制食糖零售之計劃、</p>
<h3>南貨店主　壟斷食糖被捕</h3>
<p>法警察署近爲調查零售物價、禁止壟斷起見、曾對各糖商檢查存貨、乃有西門路四十六號裕昌泰南貨號老闆陸志維、雖存有大批食糖、竟拒以每斤四元三角之限價售與顧客、而以天平秤每斤八元之價私售與人、經查悉、陸聞訊他逃、但卒於翌日就逮、</p>
<h3>中央信讬局　定期發還存款</h3>

<p>家庭</p>
<h3>凡事躬親</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>在一般家庭裏，很容易聽到不滿意傭婦的怨言，因爲傭婦們的一舉一動，終不能迎合主婦的期望。</p>
<p>其實仔細想來，傭婦們都是沒有智識的，他們決沒有新頴的思想，做事的能力，怎能够和丰婦相比呢？因此家裏即使是用了一大羣的傭婦，結果主婦還是不會感覺滿意的。</p>
<p>佛蘭克林曾經有一句話：「如果你要一個忠實而爲你所愛好的僕人，請你自己服侍你自己。」這　是我國人所謂「凡事躬親」了。</p>
<p>事實上，在家庭中的許多事，並不必委諸傭婦的，早晨買菜主婦可以親自上小菜塲，則可以挑選新鮮而價廉的菜肴，二則可以免除傭婦從中漁利。帶領孩子，可以自己担任，一則可以使孩子們得到周到的照顧，二則可以免除傭婦們不良習慣或言語的灌輸，入廚燒菜，也可以自己動手。一則可使鹹淡適中，二則也可以免除油醬的過分消耗。這樣，旣合乎勤儉的治家原則，也可以說是適合目前時代的舉動了。</p>
<h3>防止傷風</h3>
<p>— 怡</p>
<p>一般人都以爲傷風是一種很微小的不舒快，只是一種小小的刺激而已，但是即使是很輕的傷風，也可以轉成嚴重的病症，所以防止傷風，其重要不下於防止其他嚴重的傳染病。</p>
<p>秋冬之交，可說是傷風最流行的季節，天氣乍冷，衣服單薄，就容易罹患傷風。所以對於傷風的一般智識，不可不知。</p>
<p>傷風分別起來，可以分爲兩種，一種是傳染的，一種是非傳染的，非傳染的傷風，起因是本來存留在口腔中的無數細菌，一旦越出了牠們的範圍、，而向黏膜侵襲，傳染　傷風是由於細菌的傳染。不過如果一個人的傷風雖非起於傳染，他可以傳染給別人，所以息有傷風的人，應該免除把手放近嘴邊，而在吃東西而須要用手的時候，先把手洗淸。</p>
<p>在非由於傳染而起的傷風，旣起於口腔黏膜，不使口腔黏膜遇到刺激，是很重要的，過份的吸烟，用口腔呼吸都足以引起黏膜的刺激。</p>
<p>疲倦也可以引起傷風，所以起息要按時間，睡眠務求充足。神經易受刺激的人，易於感染傷風，所以心平氣和，也是防止傷風的妙法。</p>
<p>溫度突然改變，是致成傷風的最可能的原因，在一間很溫暖的屋子裏，突然吹進一陣風來，就可以使身體比較衰弱的人傷風，因爲人類身體的體溫是全身在隨時調節的，偶爾在某一部份起了特殊的變化，就要使寒氣內　了。</p>
<p>平時多呼吸新鮮空氣，也可以增强身體的抵抗力。</p>
<p>在已有傷風的象徵時候，就不宜遲緩，用熱水洗足，浸上二十至三十分鐘即行上床安睡，蓋較厚的棉被，使身體出汗。如有高熱度，那末應該請醫生診治。</p>
<p>因爲傷風的時候，往往鼻空是閉塞的，所以大多數人要用力去摘出鼻涕來，這應該注意，以免引起耳部受到損害。</p>
<p>保持身體溫暖，勿使身體疲倦或神經緊張，使身體達到健康的狀態，是防止傷風的有效方法。</p>
<h3>哺乳須知</h3>
<p>— 珠英</p>
<p>乳汁是孩子存放的產業</p>
<p>應該怎樣哺乳纔算盡了責任</p>
<p>兒童是國家未來的主人翁，將來是要負担國家重大的責任，要是精神不足，體力不勝，其他條件再具備些，恐將來未必能負起偉大的任務，成爲有爲的國民。可是國人的身體，十人倒有七八是有病態的，這　全是由於在嬰孩時未能受　良好的養育，及後，雖在成長後，設法加以調養，恐未必能轉弱爲强。於此可知，身體强弱與否，端在嬰孩時的養育以及哺乳方法是否得當爲先決條件的。</p>
<p>一·哺乳：初生兒需要良好的營養，以用母乳爲最宜，因母乳哺育，爲人工營養中的標準方法，兒乳之中含有導下胎便的物質，其所含的成分，恰與初生兒的消化力相符，其量又與初生兒之胃內容相。</p>
<p>母乳營養，不特有益嬰兒，且於母體有絕大利益，法國有一位著名醫學博十闢勒達說：「若是你想當一個完美的母親，那末你必須盡哺乳的責任，因爲你的乳是孩子存放在你的產業，不是你自己的東西，你須送還給你的孩子。」這些話很遭許多啼女的反對，有的說身體衰弱的母親，不應盡哺乳的責任，有的說哺乳有損母親的健康和美貌，所以須得用乳母哺乳。</p>
<p>其實母親自己哺乳有許多益處的，不妨略述於下：</p>
<p>（甲）母親親自哺乳，因小兒吸乳動作的刺激，使子宮收縮增强，爲預防產後出血的最好的方法，同時使母親下腹臟器，早期恢復正常狀態。</p>
<p>（乙）母親親自哺乳時，可以防止第二次受孕的過早，不哺乳的婦女，往往內生產過密，反而易致身體衰老。</p>
<p>（丙）母親親自哺乳，能使皮膚細嫩，面現光彩，眼光靈活，頭髮茂盛而光亮，並且還可防止身體肥胖，彼以哺乳爲有損母體，實爲大謬。</p>
<p>（丁）小兒受母親綿密的看護，其在身體上及精神上所受的利益，自與他人看護者不同</p>
<p>（戊）母乳營養較獸乳（牛乳，羊乳）營養更有種種優點：（一）獸乳的成分及各成分的性質，與人乳不同，但無論如何，人乳適於小兒身體的發育，（二）人乳較獸乳在體內易於消化及吸收，（三）母乳直接自乳房輸入小兒體內，無腐敗或混人病原菌的危險，獸乳則不然，（四）據事實及統訂，母乳榮養兒較人工榮養兒發育迅速，目患病數减少，死亡率甚低。</p>
<p>所以說，　做母親的必須盡哺乳的責任，　不可濫　給養，甚至一日哺乳十餘次，母哺之外，又雇乳母喂哺，更添加奶粉，甚至以米粉米飯等喂給生未數月的嬰兒，加之又無哺兒的規定時間，要知無論爲質的不台及量的過多過少，皆能使嬰兒起營養障礙。</p>
<p>嬰兒產後十二小時內，可不必哺乳，但需每二小時喂水沙許，十二小時後，每四小時，哺乳一次，其哺乳時間晨六時，晨十時，下午二時，下午六時，下午十時，夜二時；喂水時間晨八時，正午十二時，下午四時，下午八時。最初母乳雖分泌不多，仍宜按時哺乳，以養成初生兒吸吮乳計的習慣，且可催起泌乳，在日間兩次哺乳之中隔時期，宜用消毒淸潔的奶瓶，喂以溫開水約三十公撮，此不僅與以水分，且可養成用奶瓶的習慣，萬一母體偶然缺乏乳汁及其他情形時，可無不習喂瓶之慮，每次哺乳時間，通常不得超過十五分鐘、（未完）</p>
<h3>碎錦格</h3>
<p>— 茵</p>
<p>假使你肯在閒暇的時候，把你所有的零星短布，好好地整理和計劃一下，那麼你不久就可以製出一幅最有趣的被面或床毬來了。</p>
<p>當你整理零星短布的時候，你立刻便可以明白，黃色的布有多少，紅色的布有多少，綠色的布有多少，印有碎花的布有多少……</p>
<p>如果你計劃把零星的布，用綫縫紉，使成爲一隻鵝，那麼你可以把白布剪成鵝的身體，黃布剪成它的頭額和嘴，紅布剪成它的脚，然後用綠布和印有花紋的布作爲它的背景。這樣一片片的用綫縫好，使變成一幅一尺二寸左右見方的凑合物。</p>
<p>你耐心地照着上面方法，多多地縫成幾幅，直等憫你計算起來，足够拚成一幅被面或床毯為止。</p>
<p>在拚成被面或床毯的時候，你可以去買幾尺淡靑色的細布，裁成和上述凑合物同樣大小的尺寸，然後互相用綫縫合起來——這是說：每一幅有鵝形的布，和一幅淡靑色　綴在一起，這樣相間地縫下去，使成爲一大幅床毯或被面。</p>
<p>當然，假使是床毯的話，在拚成文幅以後，還可以在四周加上一道淡黃色的闊邊，使得它更爲美觀一些。</p>
<p>至於鵝的圖案，不必求其像眞。但求其象形便好了。</p>
<h3>葛氏家書十二封</h3>
<p>— 徐百益譯</p>
<p>葛　亨先生的兒子，自從升至開帳員後，他的羅曼史，也從此開始了，他賣了五十二塊錢的玫瑰花，而記在父親的帳上，這在萬賴亨先生，自然要認為是最不適當的措置。充滿着人生經騐的葛賴亨先生，對於他兒子的盲目地進行婚事，不覺害怕起來，因此立刻寫信忠吿他，希望他不致造成終身的錯誤。</p>
<p>第九封　終身大事</p>
<p>親愛的兒子：</p>
<p>我把這裏所附的信件拆開的時候，我立刻知道是拆錯了信，因為裏面原來是一張發票，是送給遠許干小姐的玫瑰花，共計五十二元。</p>
<p>對於達許干小姐，我並沒有什么惡感，不過像那樣的女子，是要金錢去培植的。如果你忠實地吿訴她你每星期所得的薪金是十二元，並且在最近沒有增加的希望，你一定可以發現她並不會和你親近。</p>
<p>當然，你現在離訂婚的階段還遠，所以當我發現你有結婚的企圖時，就有些惶恐了。一個只賺十二塊錢週薪的職員而花了五十二元的玫瑰花費，他所需要的不是一個妻子而是一個管理者。到後來你會知道，把五十二塊錢可以買多少伙食。</p>
<p>我以為諸如此類的行動，你可以徵求我的忠告和判斷，因為當一個兒子要買一匹馬的時候，他往往會去和他的父親商量，但在選擇配偶的時候就不然了。婚姻也許可以由天定，但大都的情形是在燈火暗淡的　角處定奪的，在那地方，男子在追求女子的時候，因為很少會去看看對方的家庭，所能够看見的，就只是對方的好處，而並不能發現壞處。一個人不　挑選他的母親，但是他可以挑選他孩子的母親。</p>
<p>你要記住，切不要和一個窮苦出身而像富家子女一樣養育的女子結婚，因爲這些女子是根本不切實際的。我所以要向你說這些話是因爲看到你已經向着結婚的路出發，而照此下去，你一定會遇到困難的。而且到了那時候，你也不會明白所以然。你還得記住，如果有一個女于，因爲知道我有錢而和你結婚，她就是大大的錯誤了。我想，你如果知道以十二塊錢週俸的收入而談結婚，你就應該把那買玫瑰花的五十二塊錢去買一套臥室的傢具了（在美國可以拿五十二塊錢買到一套傢具）</p>
<p>婚姻是人生最重要的事，而世界上偏有許多聰明人會做出許多錯誤的事情，可是當你和一個不適宜的配偶結婚以後，你就得終身是不必要的痛苦。你實在可以把你現在的情形吿訴你的情人，使她不致於成爲你的錯誤的配偶。</p>
<p>你的摯愛的父親葛　亨</p>
<h3>一星期家常菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>菊花黃時，也就是無腸公子橫行一世的季節。大街小巷中，東也是蟹攤，西也是蟹攤，幾乎遍地皆是；男男女女的手中，都提着成串的蟹也隨時隨處可以見到。至於蟹的代價，可眞貴得嚇人，較大的每隻要十多元，較小的也七八元五六元不等，三四元一隻的，那就太平凡了。筆者的家庭中，對於大煠蟹並沒有多大好感，倒喜歡吃吃蟹粉，往往出四五元買這第六七隻，出了蟹粉，和了蛋可做蟹粉炒蛋；和了豆腐，可做蟹粉豆腐羹；有時來一個蟹粉炒菜心，或是買些麪來，吃蟹粉麪，總算是應了景殺了饞了。一般愛吃蟹而限於經濟的家庭中，何妨如法泡製呢？</p>
<p>星期一　刀豆炒肉絲　蟹粉豆腐羹　紅燒薰蔔片　麺拖毛豆莢</p>
<p>星期二　黃豆芽牛肉　雪菜煤白魚　清炒蓬蒿菜　葱花炒芋艿</p>

<h3>Soviet Troops on the Nedo Line Prepare for Winter Counteroffensive, Fierce Fighting Continues in the Industrial Zone of Stalingrad, German Reinforcements Arrive at the Nalchik Front</h3>
<p>Berlin, 31st (Allied News Agency) - The Soviet Union is concentrating troops and munitions on the Eastern Front in preparation for a large-scale winter counteroffensive, aiming to drive the Germans out of the occupied territories. Berlin political circles state that Germany is also prepared for this. Currently, German forces have completely controlled Stalingrad and other areas. Although the Red Army is gathering along the front, German officers will not give them any exploitable opportunity.</p>
<p>Stanford, 30th (Allied News Agency) - According to news from Delhi, Soviet troops stationed in northern Iran are reportedly being transferred to the Caucasus front. Simultaneously, British troops seem to be moving north to occupy the original areas where Soviet troops were stationed.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Swedish Capital, 30th (Havas News Agency) - According to news from Moscow, German infantry, with the assistance of tanks and aircraft, launched another fierce attack on the Red Army in Stalingrad yesterday. Their objective is the industrial zone, attempting to seize important positions. The battles often begin with street fighting and end in hand-to-hand combat. The Red Army is firmly entrenched in every building, resisting resolutely. Although German losses are heavy, they are still gradually advancing, relying on their numerical superiority to break through the Red Army's positions in some areas. Nalchik has also received fresh reinforcements. Meanwhile, according to news from Berlin: (1) A large Red Army detachment is coordinating with the army in the areas of Dopes and Stalingrad. (2) After the Astarakhan-Krasni military supply line was cut off, enemy transportation to and from the front was greatly affected.</p>
<p>Berlin, 31st (Haitong News Agency) - The weather on the Eastern Front improved on Thursday, and battles occurred in many places along the line. If the good weather continues, the battles will become even more intense. The fighting in western Caucasus and the Terek region was relatively quiet. German forces continued to advance towards Natchick. The surrounded Soviet forces under the command of the German army had no way to retreat, as the German forces attacked from the flanks, cutting off all southbound roads. Although the German advance was hindered by a tributary of the Terek River, German engineers are now rushing to build bridges day and night to transport tanks and heavy artillery across the river. German aircraft continued to attack Soviet merchant ships in the Caspian Sea. The Soviet rescue operations in the Stalingrad area have shifted from the northwest of the city to the south. Although Timoshenko has deployed tanks and newly formed infantry divisions to launch attacks, the German positions have not been shaken. The mopping-up operations in the northern factory district of Stalingrad are still ongoing. The Italian army on the Don River front easily repelled the enemy's attack and inflicted heavy losses. Soviet troops concentrated south of Ostashkov, 125 kilometers northwest of Rzhev, and were bombed by German aircraft. The city and port of Murmansk were also attacked by the German air force.</p>

<h3>How to Save China</h3>
<p>— Wang Jingwei</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, we have more deeply and firmly believed that there is only one way to revitalize China and protect East Asia. There is no other way. Moreover, this path already has a reality placed before our eyes. The unreliability of Britain and the United States has long been a great disappointment to the general youth and the general public. It goes without saying. To further prove the historical facts of British and American aggression against East Asia and China, if Britain and the United States unfortunately win, with the South Seas and the Pacific controlled by Britain and the United States, the East Asian continent will have no way to protect itself and will be reduced to a British and American colony. Everyone can easily understand that China can only embark on the unfortunate fate of a second India. As for the Communist Party, after twenty years of continuous agitation, it cannot be said that it has had no influence. However, up to now, the hideous face of the Communist Party has also been exposed. The reversal of the relationship between China and Japan in the East certainly has various reasons. However, why could it not be improved, but instead reversed, and further reversed, leading to this incident? The Communist Party cannot escape its blame. Looking at the situation in the north, Outer Mongolia has already been lost, and Xinjiang in the Northwest has also been communized. If, in recent years, friendly Japan had not assisted Manchuria in establishing an anti-communist camp in the Northeast, it is truly unknown where the communist threat would have ended. In the West, when the European War was about to break out, the Soviet Union, on the one hand, colluded with Britain and the United States to surround Germany, and on the other hand, signed a non-aggression treaty with Germany, doing its utmost to provoke and sow discord. The Soviet Union cannot escape its blame for the outbreak of the European War. From this, it can be seen that today, we can only overthrow Britain and the United States to liberate East Asia and revive China, and only by opposing communism can we ensure East Asian peace and further achieve world peace. Fellow countrymen, the Greater East Asia War cannot fail, nor will it fail. Look, the Soviet Union has failed in Europe, and Britain and the United States have no more bases in the Pacific. We have not only the belief in certain victory, but also the certainty of victory. We will devote all our strength to assist friendly countries and strive for final victory. This victory is determined. It goes without saying. What will happen to China only when the Greater East Asia War is won? This is probably the greatest anxiety in the hearts of our countrymen and young people. Here, we must make decisions with reason. Only by clearly seeing the goal and identifying the direction can we know where to start and advance bravely. This question is too important. As I said just now, whether China can be saved or not depends entirely on this. It must be known that to love China and love East Asia, China and Japan should only be friends and not enemies. These few words are by no means diplomatic rhetoric. They must be understood and deeply believed by everyone, young people and countrymen alike, to be achieved. This is not only a subjective view, but also requires an objective decision. Since the Greater East Asia War, friendly countries have always won their battles and captured their objectives. Now, in the South Seas and other places, the territory they have gained is six times more than the mainland, and the resources they have gained are much richer than China's. For example, rubber is available in the South Seas but not in China. As for oil, rice, and tin, they are insufficient in China but abundant in the South Seas. As for what China has but the South Seas do not, there are only a few types of cotton and manganese. This is just one example. After the occupation of the South Seas, the objective facts are completely different from before the occupation. Thinking for Japan, thinking for China, the problems that could not be solved before have now been solved. There is another level. The so-called resources in the world are nothing more than two types: material resources and human resources. And human resources are even more important than material resources. Without human resources, there is no way to produce material resources. Why did Britain fail? Because the British imperialists only cared about material resources and did not care about human resources. They did not know that the most important thing in the world is people, is people's hearts. Although they obtained materials, without people and losing people's hearts, they were of no use. Britain's failure lies in this. Friendly Japan clearly sees that human resources are more important than material resources, so it wants the hearts of the people of Greater East Asia to be united, and it wants the countries of East Asia to unite, to share the same mind and the same virtue, to coexist and co-prosper. This is not just a subjective expectation, but also an objective requirement. Besides this, there is no other way. Therefore, today, all those who live in East Asia, whether they are advanced countries or backward countries, can only walk together on this road. Facts have proved that the road in Chongqing is a dead end. Only peace, anti-communism, and nation-building are the great roads to revitalize China and protect East Asia. We must devote all our spirit and strength to promote comprehensive peace on this road. We must also devote all our spirit and strength to cooperate with the Greater East Asia War on this road. This road is not something that can be casually and luckily achieved. It must be known that the more effort there is, the more harvest there will be. Sharing joys and sorrows is not just empty talk. We must be sure of the future joys, and we must also shoulder the present sorrows. Some people are too fortunate, thinking that they can enjoy the happiness of peace in the peaceful areas. Fellow countrymen, this is not the time to enjoy happiness. This is the time for us to risk our own lives to save the country from a life-or-death situation. We can only endure hardship, shoulder responsibilities, and put in more effort, which will also save more vitality for the country and extend more life for the nation. We must contribute capital for China and also contribute capital for East Asia. The so-called capital is that we mobilize the hearts of the four hundred million undead people spiritually and mobilize all the power materially to complete the new mission of this new era. Fellow countrymen, although we cannot often meet each other, our hearts are the same. It goes without saying that our hearts cannot be separated, and even our hairs cannot be separated. We are united as one to shoulder the responsibility of peace, anti-communism, and nation-building, to revitalize China and protect East Asia.</p>
<p>Today, we have no other words, but to wish our countrymen, with all our enthusiasm, to have heart-to-heart, sincere unity, hard work and endurance, brave and vigorous progress, and not to be like me, who, at this age of sixty, remembers the determination of thirty-three years ago, which has not yet been completed. I earnestly hope that all countrymen will take out the strength in their hearts and the strength in their bodies to save China and save East Asia. They will save them back in your own hands.

In addition to sending British and American aircraft to bomb German and Italian positions and the rear, there was no large-scale battle. The enemy aircraft were intercepted by Axis aircraft during the air raid.</p>
<h3>Africa in the Changing Situation</h3>
<p>Foreword</p>
<p>As cold and heat alternate with the seasons, and time inevitably moves forward, so too do battlefields change, albeit with some uncertainty. Looking at the overall world situation, Africa, this "primitive continent," is currently in a state of flux.</p>
<p>The Shifting Battlefield</p>
<p>As of May 8th of this year, the German army launched a so-called summer offensive on the Kerch Peninsula. At that time, they were truly "unstoppable," successively occupying key towns such as Sevastopol, Melitopol, Voroshilovgrad, Voronezh, and Rostov. They then divided their forces into three routes, crossed the Don River, and directly attacked Stalingrad, reaching the outer perimeter of the city by mid-August. To support the Eastern Front, Hitler simultaneously launched a North African offensive in early June, driving back the British Eighth Army, which had invaded Libya. They advanced all the way, recapturing Tobruk on June 20th, and invading Egypt on June 23rd. After passing through Sollum and Sidi Barrani, they captured Mersa Matruh, 130 miles deep into Egypt, on June 30th. They then advanced southeast, occupying El Alamein on July 9th. At that time, the British Eighth Army was almost irrecoverably defeated, and its commander, Ritchie, was dismissed. Fortunately, General Auchinleck, the commander of the Middle East forces, rallied the remaining troops and turned the tide, and the Egyptian battle situation finally stabilized by the end of July, and Alexandria, which had seemed about to fall, was saved.</p>
<p>Hitler's plan for North Africa was to pass through Egypt and coordinate with the German forces descending from the Caucasus, with the aim of seizing the rich oil fields of the Caucasus and the Near East, and cutting off Britain's lines of communication between Europe and Asia. However, this plan was thwarted both by the stalemate in the Egyptian campaign and by the treacherous terrain of the Caucasus, which made him feel that he must first conquer Stalingrad in the Volga River valley before he could advance south. However, the Battle of Stalingrad lasted for two and a half months, and even though eight or nine tenths of the city have now been occupied, the fact is that it is now late autumn. Not only is there snow and ice in the Caucasus Mountains, but the Volga River will soon freeze over. In this respect, both sides, having fought fiercely for several months, seem to be exhausted and have no reason to continue fighting this winter. At least, after the German army captures Stalingrad and achieves a partial victory, they will have the opportunity to hold their occupied areas and spend the winter. Therefore, most people speculate that the battlefield will gradually shift from the Eastern Front to other places more suitable for combat, just as the seasons change, and most believe that Africa is the most likely battlefield in the future.</p>
<p>The Importance of Africa</p>
<p>Africa is the most "innocent" land in the world. Everyone's impression of it is nothing more than deserts, palm trees, pyramids, curly-haired, thick-lipped, ignorant black people, and bizarre poisonous snakes and wild beasts. It is what people often call the "primitive continent" and the "colonial continent." Since the beginning of history, it has only known how to be slaughtered and oppressed, and has never oppressed anyone. Despite this, war is still inevitable on its head. This is a tragedy of mankind, but perhaps this is the law of "evolution."</p>
<p>Africa has a total area of approximately 30 million square kilometers, but its population is only one-third of China's, approximately 140 million people, with an average of only five people per square kilometer. This is far less than Asia's 23 people per square kilometer and Europe's 47 people per square kilometer. However, because the land is not suitable for production, the climate is hot and harsh, and there are more deserts in the interior, culture and economy are very backward. Since the Berlin Conference in 1885, it has simply become the target of European powers to be divided.</p>
<p>However, since the last European war, the economic, political, and even military importance of Africa has gradually been noticed. For example, in terms of production, Egypt's cotton, South Africa's gold mines and diamonds, Sudan's gums, Rhodesia's chromium, the Gold Coast's manganese, and the coconuts, coffee, ivory, ostrich feathers, etc. produced in various places are indeed worthy of the envy of countries lacking raw materials. In political terms, Germany's former territories, which were deprived by the Treaty of Versailles, were certainly unwilling, and Italy has always believed that Britain and France cheated it after the end of the last European war, so it has long called for a redistribution of colonies. Even the outbreak of this war, the competition for colonies is one of the reasons. From a military point of view, the current war being waged by both sides is not only a total war in terms of resources, but also a global war in terms of the front line. Africa is connected to both Europe and Asia, and the closest point to South America is only 2,500 kilometers away. Both the Axis powers and the Allied powers now need to seize strongholds in Africa in order to cut off the other side's supply of raw materials, attack the other side's lines of communication, and thereby increase their own strength. Moreover, Britain and the United States are shouting for the opening of a second battlefield, and after the Eastern Front enters the winter phase, Germany and Italy also need to harass the Allied powers in other areas. Therefore, from any point of view, Africa has the possibility of being gradually used as a battlefield by both sides.</p>
<p>Recent Developments</p>
<p>The above is a discussion of the importance of Africa in terms of the situation. In fact, recent developments related to Africa in the past ten days are indeed worthy of attention.</p>
<p>First, the Egyptian front, which had been silent for more than two months, suddenly launched an offensive on October 24th by the British Eighth Army (now under the command of General Alexander, who had previously commanded the war in Burma), claiming to counterattack El Alamein with ten divisions. The British army also attempted to land east of Tobruk and Mersa Matruh, while the British Air Force repeatedly bombed the port of Genoa in southern Italy, allegedly to prevent General Rommel from obtaining reinforcements and military equipment from Europe. One day, British aircraft even bombed Crete.</p>
<p>Second, the British military operations against French Madagascar are still progressing steadily. Although this island is called an island, its area is actually larger than the territory of France itself. The United Kingdom is willing to offend its former allies and is determined to occupy this large island that straddles the route from South Africa to the Middle East, which is certainly for a special purpose and is by no means comparable to ordinary matters.</p>
<p>Third, today, when the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union are arguing endlessly about the second battlefield, South African Prime Minister Smuts (a famous general from the last European war) is boldly declaring in London that he will take the offensive and is also preparing to go to the United States. At this moment, American troops landed in Liberia, the only independent country in West Africa, and there are rumors that this small country will sever diplomatic relations with the Axis powers. Coincidentally, Admiral Darlan, the commander-in-chief of the French Navy and Air Force, is also inspecting the French West African port of Dakar, which is the most problematic port—only 2,000 miles from Pernambuco, Brazil. After his inspection, he made a statement, stating that "Dakar will resist fully if it is invaded," and French Navy Minister Auphan also visited Toulon, where the country's entire fleet is located.</p>
<p>Introducing the Full Picture of Africa</p>
<p>In view of the above, the "African War" is indeed gradually becoming an important scene on the world stage. In order to facilitate readers' reference, this newspaper has decided to introduce the full picture of Africa in installments, forming a systematic album. The general classification is: (1) Independent countries, (2) French territories, (3) British territories, (4) Italian territories, (5) Territories of Spain, Portugal, and Belgium. There are only two articles on independent countries, Egypt and Liberia. The territories of various countries are divided into four types: self-governing dominions, directly administered colonies, protectorates, and trust territories. Each article forms a system on its own, with one or several places as the topic. They can be read separately or together. From politics and economy to customs and human feelings, the principle is to provide objective introductions and interesting descriptions. We hope that readers will pay attention to them.</p>

<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Council Specifically Implements the "Low Price" Policy. Establishment of a Public Association Section and Contact with Various Industries. Chief Controller Inagaki Issues a Statement.</h3>
<p>Mr. Inagaki To, the Chief Controller of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Goods Control Office, made a special statement to our reporter yesterday, saying, "The Bureau is currently setting up a 'Public Association Section' under the Goods Control Office, with the aim of establishing close contacts with various industry associations in terms of price control and goods distribution, so that the opinions of various industry associations can be conveyed to the top, and the Bureau's opinions can also be clearly announced, in order to avoid misunderstandings. On the one hand, if merchants encounter any difficulties in their business and make reasonable requests, the Public Association Section is prepared to accept them. Various industry associations must register with the Fuzhou Road Police Department Office No. 607 before November 30th. Any industry association that is not licensed by the Bureau will not be allowed to establish itself."</p>
<p>The Meaning of Controlling Prices Lies in Appropriateness and Reasonableness.</p>
<p>Chief Controller Inagaki continued to analyze the current situation and the relationship between it and price control, saying, "The citizens do not know the main significance of the Bureau's implementation of price control. In the future, the Bureau will continue to adopt a low-price policy, and we hope that all citizens will thoroughly understand it and assist in it. Since December 8th of last year, the situation in Shanghai has been very different from the past. In the past, the determination of the price index was entirely based on free trade, but now it must be based on a controlled economy. In other words, in the past, the standard of prices depended on the overall supply and demand of the world, but now it is only influenced by the supply and demand of materials in East Asia. Generally speaking, when materials are abundant, prices are low, and when materials are scarce, prices are high. Price control is not determined by the degree to which prices are lowered, but by setting appropriate and reasonable prices."</p>
<p>Promote Automatic Price Reduction and Hope for Restrained Consumption</p>
<p>For the past year, most of the residents, especially the Chinese, have lived frugally on weekdays, but another group of people have indulged in extravagant lifestyles. If these people can reduce their standard of living and reduce the consumption of major items, it will naturally benefit the public. In order to stabilize people's livelihoods, the authorities will strive to implement a low-price policy. On the merchant side, they should try to suppress prices as much as possible. On the general public side, they must strive to restrain consumption. As for how to specifically implement the low-price policy, I (Inagaki) believe that this cannot be achieved by legal force alone. In addition to using the law, we should promote the merchants' automatic awakening and the people's sincere cooperation. Therefore, the Bureau has now specially established the Public Association Section to establish close contacts with various industry associations, so that the opinions of the Bureau and the associations can be clearly understood by each other, so that misunderstandings can be eliminated and difficulties can be avoided. When things happen, they can be smoothly promoted, and they will inevitably achieve twice the result with half the effort, and the merchants' automatic price reduction can also be gradually realized.</p>
<p>Complete This Project With the Cooperation of Officials, Merchants, and the People.</p>
<p>Mr. Inagaki finally stated, "In the future, controlling prices will depend on the efforts and cooperation of the various industry associations and the responsible personnel of the Bureau's Public Association Section. Stores that have already joined the association are requested to cooperate with all their strength. Stores that have not joined the association should join as soon as possible, because joining the association is closely related to the distribution of materials in the future. If any stores are waiting and watching and attempt to operate freely without joining the association, the authorities will severely punish them. Furthermore, hoarding and speculating in the black market are clearly enemies of the public, and the authorities will also severely punish them. We sincerely hope that all citizens will sincerely cooperate with the authorities to achieve the above objectives. That would be fortunate indeed."</p>
<h3>The Greater Asia Federation to be Established in Mid-Month</h3>
<p>A dispatch from the Domei News Agency in Shanghai states that the Shanghai Greater Asia Federation will be established on November 15th. This is based on the report of the preparatory meeting of the Federation yesterday. The purpose of the Federation is to promote cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese people and to nurture Asian culture.</p>
<h3>The Public Association is Allowed to Resume Business</h3>
<p>According to Domei News Agency, the relevant authorities, in view of the current state of Shanghai's economy, which has gradually returned to normal, have decided to place the Public Association (Foreign Stock Exchange) under military control and allow it to resume business. The authorities of the Asia Development Board made a statement on this on the 31st, saying that after the Japanese army entered the concession in Shanghai, in order to prevent the economic world from shaking, various exchanges were closed. After detailed investigation of the recent economic situation and consideration of the position of the Shanghai financial market, it was decided to first place the Public Association, which had been closed by the Japanese army, under military control and allow it to resume business. The Asia Development Board, entrusted by the Japanese army, has decided to implement strict supervision and allow the Public Association to conduct specific transactions such as Chinese stock and central and local public bonds as its main business. However, under the current situation, it is still necessary to adopt strict control over the Public Association, and it is also intended to fully adopt strict measures to suppress speculative transactions. Concrete measures for the opening of the Public Association are expected to be decided soon, and the traders of the Public Association will be recruited from powerful brokers in the city. At the same time, a strict crackdown policy will be adopted against illegal operations similar to stock exchanges for many years.</p>
<h3>If the Situation Requires it, Rationed Sugar Distribution Will be Implemented. Retail Store Clerks are Lazy in Responding.</h3>
<p>The sugar situation in the city has shown signs of worsening again. Well-informed sources expressed their opinion that the only effective way to quickly improve the sugar situation is for the municipal authorities to control the distribution of sugar. If necessary, sugar ration tickets will be issued to residents. Although the Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office has made various efforts, it has not formulated a smooth distribution plan, resulting in long queues of sugar buyers in front of Nanhua stores throughout the city. This situation is similar to the rice and bread crisis encountered by residents before the implementation of grain rationing.</p>
<p>Inspections to be Implemented From Today</p>
<p>Over the past two weeks, hoarding and speculation of sugar have been quite obvious. The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office announced the other day that in order to restore the normal state of the sugar situation, it will conduct periodic inspections of retail businesses that receive more than 30 bags of sugar per month from today, in order to supervise the retail business of sugar and prohibit hoarding and speculation. It is reported that shops that receive more than 30 bags of sugar per month must sell one-thirtieth of their allocated amount on a daily basis, and the remainder must also report their daily sales. Anyone found to be hoarding and speculating will no longer be allocated sugar. The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office has discovered that the sugar shortage is caused by shop owners' manipulation, so it has decided to control sugar retail.</p>
<h3>Nanhua Store Owner Arrested for Monopolizing Sugar</h3>
<p>The French police recently inspected the inventory of various sugar merchants in order to investigate retail prices and prohibit monopolies. It was found that Lu Zhiwei, the owner of Yuchangtai Nanhua Store at No. 46 Ximen Road, had a large amount of sugar in stock, but refused to sell it to customers at the limited price of 4.3 yuan per catty, and privately sold it to others at a price of 8 yuan per catty using a balance. After investigation, Lu heard the news and fled, but was eventually arrested the next day.</p>
<h3>The Central Trust Bureau to Issue Deposits on Schedule</h3>
<p>According to Domei News Agency, the Central Trust Bureau has been ordered by the Japanese military authorities to liquidate since September 14th. It has now been decided to start the first issuance of deposits in accordance with the following items: (1) The first issuance of deposits is 1,000 yuan per household, but the funds paid by the industry from December 9th, 1941 to September 13th, 1942 are all included; (2) For households with deposits of 5,000 yuan or more, the issuance must be noted that they are not hostile before payment can be made; (3) Address for issuing deposits: Central Trust Bureau Shanghai Branch, 2nd Floor, 592 Fuxu Road; (4) Starting date for issuing deposits: November 4th, from 10:00 am to noon; (5) The second issuance of deposits will be announced separately.</p>

<h3>Electricity Consumption Restrictions to be Implemented in the French Concession from Today. Special Difficulties in Obtaining Raw Materials.</h3>
<p>Consular Decree No. 346 of the French Consulate in Shanghai: In order to carry out the order, the Consulate hereby promulgates the following articles in accordance with Articles 9, 10, and 13 of the Organization Charter of the Shanghai French Concession Board of Directors of January 15, 1927, Consular Decree No. 347 of September 26, 1941, Consular Decree No. 453 of December 9, 1941, the Board of Directors' notice, and the report of the General Manager of the Shanghai French Water and Electricity Company regarding the unexpected and special difficulties in obtaining raw materials.</p>
<p>Massive Consumption is Prohibited</p>
<p>(Article 1) From November 1, 1942, electricity consumption shall be subject to the following restrictions: (Article 2) Except for industrial use, bakeries, medical equipment, and electric stoves for heating, the use of electricity for electric heating is prohibited. (Article 3) Electricity consumption for electric lights (households, shops, warehouses, factories, etc.), motive power (regardless of type), and permitted electric heating shall be limited to 100% of the monthly standard consumption calculated in accordance with Article 4 below. In addition to the general rules applicable to this decree, advertising and decorative equipment, such as advertising signs and shop signs that consume a large amount of electricity, lanterns, and strong spotlights, are prohibited.</p>
<p>Method for Calculating Electricity Consumption</p>
<p>(Article 4) For users whose electricity consumption has exceeded 400 kilowatt-hours (i.e., 4,000 watt-hours) in one or more months since January 1942, the standard amount of new electricity use (i.e., the old standard amount used to replace Consular Decree No. 347 of September 26, 1941) shall be calculated as follows:</p>
<p>(1) For formal electricity equipment that existed before February 1, 1942, the standard electricity consumption shall be the monthly average of the three months with the highest electricity consumption from January to September 1942. However, if this consumption exceeds 80% of the previously applied monthly standard consumption, it shall be reduced to 80% of the previous standard consumption.</p>
<p>(2) For electricity equipment that has formally started or changed since February 1, 1942, the standard electricity consumption shall be determined jointly by the Board of Directors and the Water and Electricity Company.</p>
<p>(Article 5) Regardless of the type of user, if the monthly electricity consumption exceeds 400 kilowatt-hours (i.e., 4,000 watt-hours), or if the consumption is above 400 kilowatts (i.e., 4,000 watt-hours) and exceeds the amount permitted in Article 4 above, an additional surcharge shall be paid for the excess portion. The calculation method is as follows:</p>
<p>For the portion exceeding the quota by 10%, pay five times the full amount at the current price.</p>
<p>For the portion exceeding the quota by 11% to 20%, pay ten times the full amount at the current price.</p>
<p>For the portion exceeding the quota by more than 20%, pay 20 times the full amount at the current price.</p>
<p>(Article 6) The surcharges obtained in accordance with Article 5 shall be credited to a special reserve fund for the benefit of consumers and shall be handled in accordance with a consular decree to be announced for this purpose in the future.</p>
<p>Reduction in Power Supply by Percentage Exceeding Limit</p>
<p>(Article 7) For users who use motive power and whose normal electricity exceeds 50 kilowatts, in addition to being subject to the restrictions listed above, they may reduce 90% of the electricity they rent, but the remaining usable electricity, in any case, cannot be lower than 50 kilowatts. This reduction restriction applies during the period from 17:00 to 22:00 every day from November to March (this time refers to the time in Shanghai on November 1, 1942. If the time is changed, it shall be calculated according to the corresponding time).</p>
<p>Temporary Suspension of Supply for Violations</p>
<p>(Article 8) If a user does not comply with the above rules, in addition to being punished in accordance with the provisions of Article 5, they shall be notified to comply with the provisions of this decree. If they still ignore it, the electricity supply to the user may be suspended for a certain period of time after considering the opinions of the Board of Directors and the Water and Electricity Company. (Article 9) The supply of electricity required for new equipment or the expansion of existing equipment shall be refused. However, this shall not apply to the electricity necessary for private water intake equipment, elevators, and household water tanks for newly built or future residential buildings, as well as the lighting required for such residential buildings. (Article 10) The above provisions may be varied in the event of public order, after considering the opinions of the Board of Directors or the Police Department and the Water and Electricity Company. (Article 11) Consular Decrees Nos. 247 and 465 of September 26, 1941 and December 9 of the same year, which were promulgated regarding the restriction of electricity, are repealed. (Article 12) The Director-General of the Board of Directors and the Chief Superintendent of the Police Department shall each enforce this decree within the scope of their respective powers.

<h3>Unprecedented Changes in the Bond Market: All Bonds Plunge by Four Yuan, Hitting the Limit Down</h3>
<p>The gray market for public bonds suddenly underwent unprecedented changes yesterday. People were agitated and rumors spread. This was due to the announcements in various newspapers that the authorities would crack down on speculation in public bonds and study effective countermeasures. After the market opened, there were only sellers in the market. The opening price for Type C bonds immediately saw 58.5 yuan, only four cents away from the limit down price. Initially, there were still short-covering and those buying low, but seeing the low, they actually rebounded by more than one yuan. Afterwards, the selling pressure increased. As the market was about to close, the market was filled with selling voices, and finally all bonds were announced to have hit the limit down. This kind of extreme change was like a bolt from the blue. At the close, there were still sell orders at a slightly lower price of two yuan. Although this unexpected change seemed sudden, there was actually news beforehand, but it was not noticed by the general public. Yesterday, there were still many people holding a large number of goods, unaware of the underlying situation. After it becomes widespread, the changes may be more than this. As a result, the market price uniformly fell by four yuan, hitting the limit down. The total transaction volume was about four million yuan or more. A brief table is listed below:</p>

For the hundreds of others allocated between 15 and 30 bags, and the more than 200 allocated less than 15 bags, inspectors will be dispatched to check sales accounts at any time, in order to prevent the occurrence of black markets and eliminate malpractices. Starting today, Type A retailers are limited to selling five yuan worth of sugar per person. Sales will be widespread throughout the city, and there must be no shortage of weight or adulteration with impurities. Otherwise, once discovered, in addition to severe punishment, the right to allocation will be permanently lost.</p>

<h3>Decorative Gold Meanders and Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the city's silver and money industry, the jewelry gold market of Daxin peer's storefront did not change its listed exchange price of 2,550 yuan per tael (buying in reduced by about 300 yuan). The price for inter-industry transactions meandered and declined, and the price has retreated to within 1,300 yuan. This is because the price of the United Reserve Note has retreated to around 4.8 yuan. People's hearts are softening, and the morning inherited the upward momentum of the previous day, initially at 1,340 yuan, an increase of 25 yuan, but under selling pressure, it gradually fell by a small amount of 40 yuan, falling to 2,300 yuan. The price for limit-selling households was raised to 2,320 yuan. At noon, it fell again, and at noon it was 2,290 yuan for fewer buyers, a decrease of 25 yuan compared to the previous day, with a difference of 50 yuan. Transactions were sparse.

<h3>Doing Everything Yourself</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>In general households, it is easy to hear complaints about dissatisfaction with maids because the maids' every move ultimately fails to meet the expectations of the mistress.</p>
<p>In fact, on careful thought, maids are all without knowledge; they definitely do not have new ideas or the ability to do things, how can they compare to a mistress? Therefore, even if a large group of maids are employed in the home, the mistress will still not feel satisfied.</p>
<p>Franklin once had a saying: "If you want a faithful and beloved servant, please serve yourself." This is what we Chinese call "doing everything yourself."</p>
<p>In fact, many things in the household do not need to be entrusted to maids. In the morning, the mistress can personally go to the vegetable market to buy groceries, then she can choose fresh and inexpensive dishes, and second, she can avoid the maids from profiting from them. Taking care of the children can be done by oneself, first, it can allow the children to receive attentive care, and second, it can avoid the maids from instilling bad habits or language. Cooking can also be done by oneself, first, it can ensure that the saltiness is appropriate, and second, it can also avoid excessive consumption of oil and soy sauce. In this way, it not only conforms to the principle of diligence and thrift in managing the household, but it can also be said to be an appropriate action for the current era.</p>
<h3>Preventing Colds</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Most people think that a cold is a very minor discomfort, just a small irritation, but even a very mild cold can turn into a serious illness, so preventing colds is no less important than preventing other serious infectious diseases.</p>
<p>The turn of autumn and winter can be said to be the most popular season for colds. The weather suddenly turns cold, and clothing is thin, making it easy to contract a cold. Therefore, general knowledge about colds is essential.</p>
<p>Colds can be divided into two types: infectious and non-infectious. Non-infectious colds are caused by the countless bacteria that originally reside in the oral cavity. Once they cross their boundaries and invade the mucous membranes, infectious colds are caused by the spread of bacteria. However, even if a person's cold is not due to infection, he can transmit it to others, so people with colds should avoid putting their hands near their mouths, and when eating and needing to use their hands, they should first wash their hands clean.</p>
<p>In colds that are not due to infection, since they originate in the oral mucosa, it is important to avoid exposing the oral mucosa to irritation. Excessive smoking and breathing through the mouth can both cause irritation to the mucous membranes.</p>
<p>Fatigue can also cause colds, so rest on time and get enough sleep. People with easily irritated nerves are prone to catching colds, so a calm and peaceful mind is also a good way to prevent colds.</p>
<p>Sudden changes in temperature are the most likely cause of colds. In a very warm room, suddenly a gust of wind blows in, which can cause people with weaker bodies to catch a cold, because the temperature of the human body is constantly adjusted throughout the body, and occasionally a special change occurs in a certain part, which will cause the cold air to enter.</p>
<p>Usually breathing more fresh air can also enhance the body's resistance.</p>
<p>When there are already signs of a cold, it is important not to delay. Wash your feet with hot water, soak them for 20 to 30 minutes, and then go to bed and sleep soundly, covering yourself with a thicker quilt to make your body sweat. If you have a high fever, you should consult a doctor.</p>
<p>Because the nasal passages are often blocked during a cold, most people have to forcefully remove the nasal mucus, which should be noted to avoid causing damage to the ears.</p>
<p>Keeping the body warm, avoiding fatigue or nervous tension, and bringing the body to a healthy state are effective ways to prevent colds.</p>
<h3>Breastfeeding Tips</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>Milk is the property stored for the child.</p>
<p>How should breastfeeding be done to fulfill the responsibility?</p>
<p>Children are the future masters of the country and will bear the great responsibilities of the country in the future. If their spirit is insufficient and their physical strength is inadequate, even if other conditions are met, they may not be able to shoulder great tasks and become capable citizens in the future. However, seven or eight out of ten Chinese people are unhealthy. This is entirely because they did not receive good nurturing as infants. Later, even if they try to recuperate after growing up, they may not be able to turn weakness into strength. From this, it can be seen that whether the body is strong or weak depends on the nurturing during infancy and whether the breastfeeding method is appropriate as a prerequisite.</p>
<p>1.  Breastfeeding: Newborns need good nutrition, and breast milk is the most suitable. Breast milk feeding is the standard method of artificial nutrition. Breast milk contains substances that guide the excretion of fetal stools, and its components are consistent with the digestive capacity of newborns, and its amount is consistent with the stomach contents of newborns.</p>
<p>Breast milk nutrition is not only beneficial to infants, but also has great benefits to the mother's body. A famous French medical Dr. Pilleda said: "If you want to be a perfect mother, then you must fulfill the responsibility of breastfeeding, because your milk is the property stored for your child, not your own, you must return it to your child." These words are strongly opposed by many crying women. Some say that mothers with weak bodies should not fulfill the responsibility of breastfeeding, and some say that breastfeeding is harmful to the mother's health and beauty, so they must use a wet nurse to breastfeed.</p>
<p>In fact, there are many benefits for mothers to breastfeed themselves, which may be briefly described below:</p>
<p>(A) The mother's own breastfeeding can enhance the contraction of the uterus due to the stimulation of the child's sucking action, which is the best way to prevent postpartum bleeding, and at the same time allows the mother's lower abdominal organs to return to normal early.</p>
<p>(B) When the mother breastfeeds herself, she can prevent premature second conception. Women who do not breastfeed often produce too densely, which can easily lead to physical aging.</p>
<p>(C) The mother's own breastfeeding can make the skin delicate, the face radiant, the eyes sharp, the hair lush and shiny, and it can also prevent obesity. It is a big mistake to think that breastfeeding is harmful to the mother's body.</p>
<p>(D) The benefits that children receive in terms of body and spirit from the mother's close care are naturally different from those who are cared for by others.</p>
<p>(E) Breast milk nutrition has various advantages over animal milk (cow's milk, goat's milk): (1) The composition and properties of each component of animal milk are different from those of human milk, but no matter what, human milk is suitable for the development of the child's body, (2) Human milk is easier to digest and absorb in the body than animal milk, (3) Breast milk is directly transported from the breast to the child's body, without the risk of spoilage or mixing with pathogens, which is not the case with animal milk, (4) According to facts and statistics, breastfed children develop faster, have fewer illnesses, and have a very low mortality rate compared to artificially fed children.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is said that mothers must fulfill the responsibility of breastfeeding and cannot give food indiscriminately, even breastfeeding more than ten times a day, and in addition to mother feeding, they also hire wet nurses to feed, and even add milk powder, and even feed rice flour and rice to infants who have not been born for several months, and there is no fixed time for feeding. It should be known that whether the quality is inappropriate or the quantity is too much or too little can cause nutritional disorders in infants.</p>
<p>Infants do not need to be breastfed within twelve hours after birth, but they need to be fed water every two hours. After twelve hours, they should be breastfed every four hours. The breastfeeding times are 6:00 AM, 10:00 AM, 2:00 PM, 6:00 PM, 10:00 PM, and 2:00 AM; the watering times are 8:00 AM, 12:00 PM, 4:00 PM, and 8:00 PM. Initially, although the mother's milk is not secreted much, it should still be breastfed on time to develop the newborn's habit of sucking milk, and it can also promote lactation. During the period between two breastfeedings during the day, a sterilized and clean baby bottle should be used to feed about 30 cc of warm boiled water, which not only provides water, but also develops the habit of using a baby bottle, so that in case the mother is occasionally short of milk or other circumstances, there is no need to worry about not being used to feeding the bottle. The usual breastfeeding time should not exceed fifteen minutes. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Scrap Fabric Grid</h3>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>If you are willing to take advantage of your spare time to carefully sort out and plan all your scraps of fabric, then you will soon be able to make a most interesting quilt cover or bedspread.</p>
<p>When you sort out the scraps of fabric, you can immediately see how much yellow cloth there is, how much red cloth there is, how much green cloth there is, how much cloth with broken flowers there is…</p>
<p>If you plan to sew the scraps of cloth with thread to make a goose, then you can cut the white cloth into the goose's body, the yellow cloth into its head and beak, the red cloth into its feet, and then use the green cloth and cloth with patterns as its background. Sew these pieces together piece by piece with thread to make a composite of about one foot two inches square.</p>
<p>Patiently sew several more of these pieces using the above method, until you calculate that you have enough to piece together a quilt cover or bedspread.</p>
<p>When piecing together the quilt cover or bedspread, you can buy a few feet of light blue fine cloth, cut it into the same size as the above composite, and then sew them together with thread - that is to say, each piece of cloth with a goose shape is joined together with a piece of light blue cloth, and so on alternately, to make a large bedspread or quilt cover.</p>
<p>Of course, if it is a bedspread, after piecing together the text, you can also add a wide border of light yellow around the edges to make it more beautiful.</p>
<p>As for the goose pattern, it is not necessary to make it look realistic. Just make it symbolic.</p>
<h3>Twelve Letters from the Grell Family</h3>
<p>— Translated by Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>Mr. Grell Heinrich's son, since being promoted to ledger clerk, his romance has also begun. He sold fifty-two dollars' worth of roses and charged them to his father's account, which Mr. Grell Heinrich naturally considered the most inappropriate measure. Filled with life experience, Mr. Grell Heinrich became afraid of his son's blindly pursuing marriage, so he immediately wrote a letter to faithfully advise him, hoping that he would not make a lifelong mistake.</p>
<p>Letter Nine: A Lifelong Matter</p>
<p>Dear Son:</p>
<p>When I opened the attached letter, I immediately knew that I had opened the wrong letter, because inside was originally an invoice for roses sent to Miss Dorothy Dunne, totaling fifty-two dollars.</p>
<p>I have no ill feelings towards Miss Dunne, but a woman like that needs money to cultivate. If you faithfully tell her that your weekly salary is twelve dollars and that there is no hope of an increase in the near future, you will surely find that she will not be close to you.</p>
<p>Of course, you are still far from the engagement stage, so when I find that you have the intention of getting married, I am a little apprehensive. A clerk who only earns twelve dollars a week and spends fifty-two dollars on roses needs not a wife but a manager. Later you will know how many meals can be bought with fifty-two dollars.</p>
<p>I thought you could seek my advice and judgment on actions like these, because when a son wants to buy a horse, he often consults with his father, but not when choosing a spouse. Marriage may be ordained by heaven, but in most cases it is decided in the dim corners, where when a man is pursuing a woman, because he rarely looks at the other party's family, all he can see are the other party's advantages, and he cannot discover the disadvantages. A person cannot choose his mother, but he can choose the mother of his children.</p>
<p>Remember, never marry a woman from a poor background who is raised like a rich family's daughter, because these women are fundamentally impractical. The reason I want to say these things to you is because I see that you have already embarked on the road to marriage, and if you continue like this, you will definitely encounter difficulties. And by that time, you won't understand why. You must also remember that if a woman marries you because she knows I have money, she is making a big mistake. I think if you know that you are talking about marriage with an income of twelve dollars a week, you should use that fifty-two dollars to buy a set of bedroom furniture (you can buy a set of furniture for fifty-two dollars in the United States).</p>
<p>Marriage is the most important thing in life, and yet there are many smart people in the world who make many mistakes, but when you marry an unsuitable spouse, you will have unnecessary pain for the rest of your life. You can really tell your lover your current situation, so that she does not become your wrong spouse.</p>
<p>Your loving father, Grell Heinrich</p>
<h3>A Week's Home Cooking Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>When chrysanthemums are yellow, it is the season when the "Mr. No Intestines" (crab) roams the world. In the streets and alleys, there are crab stalls everywhere; men and women are carrying strings of crabs in their hands, which can be seen everywhere at any time. As for the price of crabs, it is really scaryly expensive. Larger ones cost more than ten yuan each, smaller ones cost seven or eight yuan or five or six yuan, and those costing three or four yuan each are too ordinary. In the author's family, they don't have much affection for boiled crabs, but they like to eat crab meat. They often spend four or five yuan to buy six or seven of them. After taking out the crab meat, they can make crab meat scrambled eggs with eggs; they can make crab meat tofu soup with tofu; sometimes they make a crab meat stir-fry with vegetables, or buy some noodles and eat crab meat noodles, which can be considered to be responding to the season and satisfying their cravings. In general families who love to eat crabs but are limited by their finances, why not do the same?</p>
<p>Monday: Knife beans stir-fried with shredded pork, crab meat tofu soup, braised smoked turnip slices, noodle-coated edamame pods</p>
<p>Tuesday: Soybean sprouts with beef, pickled cabbage with coal-eyed whitefish, stir-fried wormwood, scallion-fried taro</p>
<p>Wednesday: Shepherd's purse stir-fried with shredded pork, scallion-baked small crucian carp, dried bean curd stir-fried with pea sprouts, vegetarian oil tofu soup</p>
<p>Thursday: Tomato beef soup, crab meat stir-fried with vegetables, vinegar-glazed cabbage, shrimp roe stir-fried noodles</p>
<p>Friday: Yellow beans stewed with mutton, salted radish fried tofu, beef alfalfa, pickled cabbage mung bean sprouts</p>
<p>Saturday: Chestnuts stewed with chicken, tomato-braised mandarin fish, vermicelli stir-fried with vegetables, scallion oil radish shreds</p>
