<p>— 高劍晨</p>
<p>有一種比那滌，怡解渴的茶其功能更偉大，滋味更雋美，而且也是由我國恩賜到普世界的植物，便是那含有維他命丙，最豐富的「淸泉流齒，香霧噀人」——蘇東坡語——的柑橘啊！</p>
<p>柑橘在我國的栽培，已竟有了了五千年上下的歷史！我國那最可靠的史料尙書禹貢篇，已竟記錄了「揚州，厥包「橘柚，」錫貢」的話；——柚當另文論之。——推原它的時期，實在是在公元前二十三世紀的中葉。冬官考工記上又有「橘踰淮而化為枳，此地氣然也」的話：考工記雖非公元前十二世紀時周公的原著，據近人考證，也是公元前八世紀中東周人的作品哩。至於和柑橘有關的文字典故其散見於周秦諸子的著作中者，更是連篇累牘，不勝枚舉。司馬遷在史記貨殖列傳上甚至說：「蜀漢江陵千樹橘，此其人與千戶侯等。」則是表示在那個時候，已竟有因着這寳貴的植物而致富的人了，也可想見它和我國人的關係是多麽密切吧！</p>

<h3 id="c40">再談營養問題 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— 之滄</p>
<p>糴米要擠到三升，不是容易的事；現在已經遞改為二升，價格是三元，「找頭」問題彼此便利，但由此平米以一百五十元計。糴米的日子亦因之少了起來，這是不得已的事，然而對於市民則更感來日大難。</p>
<p>據衛生家言，吃白米頗不衛生，因為維他命缺乏之故，要多吃些雜物——如黃豆之類，就較合乎營養標準。驟聽之下，不禁使平糴者雀躍三百，繼而一想，不免那個，終於瞠目不知所答。因為目今合於營養標準的不見得會便宜些，最主要的還是購買力來支撑維他命危局。巿上玉蜀黍餅同樣耍一毛一只，吃下去不致會心廣體胖起來。</p>
<p>於是衛生家又重申在米糧外「吃豆腐」的口號。據說豆腐菠菜之類，滋養是最充份不過的，有些嬰孩們因為奶粉斷絕來源，便以「豆奶」來代替，照樣喝得肥肥胖胖云。</p>
<p>抱歉得很，豆腐今日之下又漲了價。本埠豆腐業為製造原料踵貴已一度通吿增漲，豆腐起碼，由五分增為一角。茲該業又於本月一日通吿起碼兩角，豆腐如此飛漲，致使衛生家亦有呼籲無門之苦，要是深入人間的話，我想亦將為之日日愁眉苦臉不巳。——這就太不「衛生」。猶憶李太白會經嘲笑過杜甫，說是：「借問別來太瘦生？」但現在我倒要把這奉贈給現代的樂天主義者的李白們了。</p>
<p>事實俱在，要吃豆腐，終有實質（固體）存在，即令是豆渣罷，亦復如此。如果要算算，我想自來水新訂之價每立方公尺為四角二分，一班好為淸談者品茗亦有檢討之必要。</p>
<p>好在這和豆腐店一樣，又是「血本攸關」問題，是不是？</p>
<h3 id="c41">在十字街頭 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— 余羽</p>
<p>把自已緊閉在斗室裏，已有四十天了，整日儘想着未來的日子。</p>
<p>深怕人家知道自己還這樣蠢蠢地活着，所以連出門也鼓不大起勇氣，但偶然要一件東西用，非到店家去買不可，也只得硬着頭皮，跑上了寒風四周的十宇街頭。</p>
<p>然而偏有相識的人迎了上來，拍着我的肩：</p>
<p>「是你——？」</p>
<p>「噢！」不自主地，我回過頭去，「原來是你。」</p>
<p>接着是相對着的況默。</p>
<p>「一個月多了，我們相別。」還是我先開口：「學校裏有消息嗎？」</p>
<p>「去過一次，沒有一個人。……你預備怎樣？以後！」</p>
<p>我瞪大管眼，呆呆地：「你呢？」</p>
<p>「……」悽淸地，他看了我一眼。</p>
<p>於是，大家都掉下淚來。</p>

<p>題目本應該寫「乘電車」，可是事實上只有「趕」和「擠」，語云，「必也正名乎」，因寫趕電車記。</p>
<p>上午八點三十分，雨很大。披上舊大衣，「寬旋大袖」，雨衣無論如何穿不上去。設法，只得一衣二用，冒着雨走出弄堂。頗想坐黃包車，一問價，嚇得我拔步就走，原來天晴只要五六角錢，現在獅子大開只要「三塊」了。</p>
<p>在雨點中，踏着泥漿路，好容易趕到無軌電車站。這時，站在雨地裏候車的同志，已不下二十餘人，等了約莫十分鐘，才有一輛電車姍姍而來。車上乘客像沙丁魚一般地擠着，開車的一看形勢不對，連忙把車開過馬路那邊停了下來，雖然有人趕了過去，身手矯健的捷足先得，行動遲緩的摒在車外，只好望車興嘆了。我沒有那麼大的勇氣，仍在電站旁等着。如此一連三輛，都過站不停。我心裏盤算，這回得學一點乖了，趕到並不是站頭的馬路那邊去，滿以為總可擠上了，誰知等了一會，眼巴巴望着電車姍姍而來，來了即在原站頭停下，想想沒有希望了，只得再趕過去，還沒有趕到站頭時，他又已經開行，好像同機人故意和我這沒有雨衣的人尋開心似的。最後，等了不少時候，好容易給我趕上，一看手錶，又是九點五十分，照辦公時間，遲到五十分，並且渾身泥水，如此趕電車，悔當初在學校裏不練習百碼賽跑。</p>

<p>秋海棠心裏眞有說不盡的話想對梅寳說，可是一看見她對自己這樣的依戀，心便酸得再也不能說話了，父女倆足足靜默了十多分鐘；及至梅寳想開口說話，韓老太太已上樓來了。</p>
<p>梅寳斜眼過去，向桌子上的一架檯鐘瞧了一瞧，知道時候已經很遲，便忙着站起身來。</p>
<p>「伯母，請坐，咱們回頭見吧！」她先向韓老太太笑着敷衍兩句，然後又向躺在床上的秋海棠點了一點頭。「爸爸，快安心睡覺吧！不到一個鐘我就可以回來了。」</p>
<p>秋海棠祇低低的呻吟了一下，便把臉旋向裏床去，假裝要睡的樣子。</p>
<p>其實他那裏能睡得熟？往日尙且不能，何况今天韓老頭兒又吿訴了他這樣一件使他憂喜交集的大事！只是往日，他躺在床上，還能很淸楚地聽見韓老太太坐在一張靠椅上打盹所發出來的鼾聲，今兒他是什麽都不聽見了，腦海裏所浮動的幾乎全是梅寳的影子；從住在天津的那些日子起，一直到目前，跟着他流浪在上海做歌女。他覺得這個女孩子的遭遇簡直是一年不如一年！（三二三）</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Singapore Battle is About to Commence: Both Sides Actively Sending Reinforcements; Fortress Cannons Begin to Operate <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>United Press report from the Malay Front, 1st: According to confirmed intelligence obtained by the Japanese military, the British forces, in anticipation of the impending battle for Singapore, have been increasing the number of troops stationed at the coastal batteries and bunkers along the Singapore island in recent days. The Japanese flag was hoisted on the high ground in the southeastern suburbs of Johor Bahru at 4:20 PM on January 31st.</p>
<p>United Press report from Lisbon, 1st: According to reports from New York, the New York Post today stated that Allied reinforcements for Bataan in the Philippines and Singapore are en route. Most American newspapers are focusing on Singapore. The Chicago Sun reports that Singapore is more difficult to defend than Corregidor, but easier to reinforce.</p>
<p>Reuters report from London, 2nd: After the British forces retreated to Singapore Island, the prelude to the battle for Singapore has begun. However, according to speculation here last night, it will take some time for the Japanese to transport military supplies and send reinforcements. The battle is not expected to see any major developments in the immediate future. The Japanese military may exploit its temporary air superiority to destabilize the situation in Singapore. According to Singapore Governor Thomas' announcement, a large number of reinforcements have arrived there, which has brought considerable comfort here. Regarding the fate of Singapore, the Manchester Guardian commented today that whether our forces can hold Singapore largely depends on the number of fighter planes we can send in time. We must admit that the siege of Singapore will inevitably be prolonged. If we cannot provide a continuous stream of reinforcements, its fall is inevitable.</p>
<p>Reuters report from Singapore, 2nd: Officials announced last night that many of the fortress cannons in Singapore have been bombarding the Japanese communication lines in southern Johor since last Saturday. For the past 24 hours, Japanese aircraft have been actively operating and have attacked several times. Our casualties and losses have been minimal. Regarding the evacuation of residents on Singapore Island, officials had previously ordered residents facing the Johor coast to evacuate first. Yesterday, another order was issued, requiring residents on the northeastern coast, the lower part of the western coast, and the southern coast to evacuate starting at 6:00 PM yesterday.</p>
<p>Reuters report from London, 2nd: After the Japanese military reached the Johor Strait, Singapore's value as a naval base has temporarily disappeared. The defense of Singapore has begun. The current Japanese strategy is to occupy the surrounding islands, completely isolating Singapore.</p>
<p>Reuters report from Singapore, 2nd: The British Far East Gazette stated today that British artillery on Singapore Island was active yesterday, bombarding Japanese troops in the Johor Bahru area. Three small boats off the coast of the island were attacked by gunfire. Aircraft reported frequent movement of Japanese troops southward on the mainland. In the past 24 hours, Japanese aircraft activity over Singapore has increased, and the island has suffered minor damage.</p>
<p>The British Army Claims It Will Defend to the End</p>
<p>Reuters report from Singapore, 2nd: It is reported from responsible sources here that the British army is determined to defend Singapore Island to the end. Singapore's drinking water has traditionally come from Johor's springs, flowing through pipes across the Johor Causeway. Although the causeway has been destroyed, the drinking water problem on Singapore Island has reportedly been solved. There is sufficient drinking water and food to meet the needs of the military and civilians indefinitely. If Singapore is lost, the Allied forces will be forced to retreat to the Java line. At that time, the artillery positions in northern Java will be frequently attacked, and Allied supplies will have to be transported through the ports of southern Java, on the one hand via India and South Africa, and on the other hand via Australia and the United States.</p>
<p>Reuters report from Berlin, 2nd: News from Tokyo describes the British implementation of a scorched earth policy in Johor Bahru. It is said that when the Japanese army entered, many areas of the city were burning.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency report from Tokyo, 2nd: The question of when Singapore will fall has become a topic of conversation among people in Tokyo today. Officials refuse to discuss developments in advance, but the general public believes that this will be realized before the National Foundation Day on February 11th.</p>
<p>Reuters report from Sydney, 2nd: The Sydney Morning Herald commented on the situation of the battle for Singapore today, saying that with the fall of the Malay Peninsula and the subsequent siege of Singapore, the first phase of the Pacific War has almost come to an end. Allied strategists must be planning the second phase of the war. The fate of Asian and Pacific countries depends on the outcome of this battle. Time is of the essence, and the situation is critical. The Allied forces must concentrate their forces and prepare for a major battle, and can no longer delay.</p>
<p>50,000-Ton Floating Dock Sunk</p>
<p>Havas report from Berlin, 1st: The German News Agency recently issued a message stating that the floating dock in Singapore, with a displacement of 50,000 tons, has been sunk by Japanese aircraft. This floating dock, with its large displacement, is the largest in the world and was towed from Britain to Singapore several years ago and moored in the Johor Strait.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency report from Tokyo, 2nd: Japanese aircraft heavily attacked Singapore yesterday, sinking a floating dock with a displacement of 50,000 tons. This dock was moved to Singapore at the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War.</p>
<p>Reuters report from Singapore, 2nd: The Johor Causeway, the only land route between Singapore Island and the Malay Peninsula, has been cut off for thirty-six hours. Looking at the remains of the explosion is heartbreaking. The shattered stones, broken railway tracks, and water pipes are a chaotic mess. The steel drawbridge on the Johor side has been completely destroyed. As for the drinking water problem on Singapore Island, although the water pipes from the peninsula have been cut off, the military and political authorities are not too worried. Because the reservoirs on the island have accumulated a lot of water due to recent rainfall, and artesian wells can be dug in many places to obtain water for washing.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency report from Tokyo, 2nd: The Asahi Shimbun reported that last Wednesday, 1,000 British troops in the northern part of Kulim, under the cover of artillery, attacked the Japanese army with bayonets. This battle was a rearguard action by the British army on the Malay Peninsula, so the fighting was extremely fierce.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Italian Naval Expert Comments on the War Situation: Believes Britain and the United States Will Open a Second Front in Europe <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Havas report from Rome, 1st: Admiral Dusi, a naval expert, recently published an article in "Ucci" magazine, arguing that Britain, the United States, and other countries will focus their attention on Europe, neglecting the Far East war zone, at least for the time being. The article stated that the repeated occurrence of major naval and air battles in the Atlantic and Mediterranean was within our expectations. The enemy intends to ensure full traffic safety between the Straits of Gibraltar and the Dardanelles, and even in the Black Sea. Britain and the United States are also attempting to establish a second front at Stalin's request to prevent the German spring offensive against the Soviet Union. The enemy's various landing plans are indeed a cause for concern. However, it is noteworthy that it is impossible for the enemy to pass through the Balkan Peninsula or send a large army with military equipment to land in northern Scandinavia to directly assist the Soviet Union. Because in the Balkans, the enemy may clash with Bulgaria, Albania, and even Turkey. Furthermore, in Scandinavia, the British and American fleets, relying on their naval superiority, may land at the ports of Narvik and Archangel in the Arctic region, but not until the spring. Britain and the United States can maintain communication with the Soviet Union, force Sweden to join the British and American side, resist the Axis powers, destroy Finland, and encircle Germany in the northeast, attempting to realize their ideal of victory. For this reason, Britain and the United States will temporarily abandon the battlefields of the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, and Burma. The US fleet will remain stationed in the triangular area composed of Dutch Harbor, Pearl Harbor, and the port of Guayaquil in Ecuador. In short, the battlefield is vast, and future wars are difficult to predict. What is noteworthy is that the United States will complete two new 35,000-ton battleships by the spring of 1943, which will facilitate offensive operations. However, it can be asserted that this offensive will be more difficult than at the beginning of the war in 1941.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Fierce Naval Battle Occurs Near the Marshall Islands; Japanese Launch General Offensive on the Philippines; Battle for Corregidor is Intense <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Allied News Agency report from Tokyo, 2nd: The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 7:30 PM tonight that an enemy aircraft carrier, cruiser, and destroyer squadron were discovered in the Marshall Islands area (Japanese mandate) yesterday morning. Japanese ships immediately attacked, setting one enemy cruiser on fire and shooting down eleven enemy aircraft. Other enemy ships were also damaged. The Japanese side suffered only minor damage to one small auxiliary ship, and the remaining ships and military facilities on the islands were undamaged. A total of twenty-eight people were killed or injured.</p>
<p>Reuters report from Washington, 2nd: The Navy Department announced yesterday that warships and air squadrons belonging to the US Pacific Fleet attacked Japanese naval and air bases in the Marshall Islands and Gilbert Islands. Makin Island, occupied by Japanese forces since December 7th last year, was also attacked.</p>
<p>Allied News Agency report from a certain location on the Bataan Peninsula in the Philippines, 2nd: According to battlefield news received by the headquarters, artillery fire is intense on the east coast of the Bataan Peninsula, indicating that the Japanese army has launched a general offensive against the American and Filipino forces besieged in the Mariveles area at the southern end of the peninsula.</p>
<p>Reuters report from Washington, 2nd: The War Department announced yesterday that Japanese troops in Donat, south of Manila Bay, engaged in artillery battles with American troops at the Corregidor fortress at the mouth of Manila Bay. Many small boats and barges have gathered near [text missing], and the Japanese seem to be attempting to land on [text missing] Island. On the Bataan Peninsula, Japanese forces launched several fierce attacks against our forces, but our positions remain unchanged. The two sides engaged in artillery battles throughout the day yesterday.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Announces Occupation of Moulmein</p>
<p>Allied News Agency report from Tokyo, 2nd: The General Headquarters announced at 4:15 PM today that Japanese troops on the Burmese front had entered Moulmein on the evening of January 31st. The city is 160 kilometers from Rangoon.</p>
<p>Allied News Agency report from the Burmese Front, 1st: After the Japanese army occupied the British positions south of Moulmein yesterday morning, they are now advancing towards the city of Moulmein. Japanese aircraft bombed a train yesterday and attacked the Rangoon airfield three times last night. Although the anti-aircraft fire was very intense, the Japanese aircraft returned safely.</p>
<p>Reuters report from London, 2nd: The British retreat from Moulmein across the Salween River has been confirmed. However, relevant parties emphasize that the British army will defend the new line with great determination, and that the front line has been stabilized. London considers the matter of great importance, as the location is only one hundred and twenty miles from Moulmein. If Rangoon falls, the gateway to the Burma Road will be cut off, which will greatly affect China's resistance. If London shares the same concerns as China, it is by no means an exaggeration.</p>

The government especially encourages people to plant corn, potatoes, soybeans, and peas, and provides agricultural loans. Saydam severely criticized merchants who hoard goods for profit.</p>
<h3 id="e9">People's Front Party of Chile Elects Rios as President; Cabinet of Bolivia to be Reorganized <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency report from the Chilean Capital, 2nd: People's Front candidate Rios was elected President of Chile yesterday. The total number of votes was 580,000. Rios received 254,921 votes, and right-wing candidate Campo received 201,536 votes. Rios was elected with a majority of more than 53,000 votes. The previous president, Cerda, who passed away, also belonged to the People's Front Party.</p>
<p>Havas report from the Chilean Capital, 1st: After the death of former President Cerda two months ago, voters across the country re-elected a new president today. The right-wing parties nominated former President Campo as their candidate, while the left-wing People's Front nominated Rios. The former is known for his iron fist, and political opponents have used the "pro-National Socialism" label as a means of attack. The latter is a member of the Radical Party and has a more moderate attitude. The two can be said to be evenly matched. It is expected that 580,000 people will vote nationwide today. Rios is confident that he can obtain 280,000 votes, while Campo believes that he can obtain 290,000 votes. In short, the results of this election will provide insight into the rise and fall of the two parties' strengths.</p>

Whether Chile, in addition to Argentina, will also be a country that does not comply with the "Pan-American Conference resolutions" and still maintains relations with the Axis powers will become clear after the general election.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency report from the Argentine Capital, 2nd: The Bolivian cabinet will undergo some personnel changes during the partial parliamentary elections.

The state monopoly on salt has been in effect since New Year's Day. The purpose of the state monopolies on sugar and salt is to increase government revenue. The state monopoly on sugar will first be implemented in Sichuan and Xinjiang provinces, the largest sugar-producing areas in inland China. Sichuan Province produced a total of 60 million kilograms of sugar last year. The government is also considering reducing the consumption of molasses for the production of liquid fuels, as government alcohol factories have recently been lacking molasses. The government also announced that tobacco will also be monopolized by the government, but other daily necessities have not yet been regulated.</p>

<p>Havas report from the Norwegian Capital, 1st: The Norwegian Ministry of Information recently issued a communique stating that the cabinet passed a resolution for en masse resignation yesterday, and requested that Quisling be re-elected as Prime Minister, with the following reasons: "The King and the government responsible for the war are abroad, the parliament no longer exists, and all political parties except the National Socialist Party have disappeared. Therefore, at present, only the National Socialist Party can be regarded as the only political party, so protecting the main interests of the Norwegian people is paramount. Moreover, the current cabinet members were not elected in accordance with the constitution, so there is a real need to organize a national government." In addition, the Norwegian Supreme Court also issued a communique stating, "In view of the political and constitutional situation of our country, this court held a plenary meeting, and all ten members attended. There is no objection to Quisling organizing a national government."</p>

<h3 id="e19">Certificate Collection for Returning Home Grows More Popular Daily <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>According to the Labour Bureau, the number of Chinese people applying for return home permits and half-price travel vouchers at the Bureau's various visa offices surged last weekend. The Industrial and Social Affairs Department instructed 230 factories. Reports later indicated that the factories were very concerned about the issuance of travel discount coupons. Factory owners issued application forms through the department, filled them out, and sent them in batches to the visa sub-office or the Industrial and Social Affairs Department, Office No. 609, to apply for certificates. The visa sub-offices are currently located at Nie Zhongcheng Public School (Jingzhou Road, Baker Road), the Labour Bureau Elementary School (Kenergy Road) and another Labour Bureau Elementary School (Singapore Road, Zhou Road). The Bureau is scheduled to set up another sub-office at the original site of the former Xiamen Road Prison this Tuesday to handle visa matters. It has been found that many workers have already left Shanghai to return to their hometowns. It is said that many silk spinning workers have already returned to their original homes in eastern Zhejiang, and it is also heard that there is an office in Hangzhou that can provide various conveniences to those who want to move southwest from there. However, in any case, the passes issued in Shanghai are also valid outside of Hangzhou. Skilled workers may be able to find other jobs in the area.</p>
<p>The issuance of half-price travel vouchers is valid until February 15. They are valid for ten days from the date of issuance. This means that if the voucher is issued on February 15, it can be used until February 25. Anyone with this voucher can enjoy half-price fares when traveling by ship or train to return home. If a group of more than 200 people leaves Shanghai at the same time, they can also pay half-price for the purchase of fourth-class train tickets.</p>

<p>In January 1942, the general cost of living index for Chinese workers was 1315.05 (100 in 1936). Among them, the housing rent index rose by 33.98% in half a year, which greatly increased the index for this month. Housing rent management is really necessary. Among the food categories, the increase and decrease of various items are roughly offset. Soybean oil rose by 11.81%, sugar by 16.16%, tofu fell by 15.00%, pork by 14.00%, and the rest are omitted. Flour products, such as sliced noodles, flatbread, Shandong flatbread, and fried dough sticks, are all subject to price controls. The management of major foods is very strong, and the implementation of price controls is also very strict. Therefore, the food index for this month only increased by 2.04% compared with the previous month. Among the clothing categories, Huabiao cloth rose by 19.42%, and local cloth by 26.12%. Among miscellaneous items, boiled water rose by another 66.7%.</p>

Factories that previously supplied coal and have already reported their needs for raw materials should still fill out and submit the registration form. This matter is of great importance, and the supply of raw materials in the future may depend on whether the quantity reported is complete and accurate.</p>

<p>Enthusiastic Donations from Datung Colleagues</p>
<p>There were many applicants for this year's fund, but the donations were limited. After appealing to all sectors of society, donations have gradually become more enthusiastic yesterday, which shows that the enthusiasm of people in society to donate money to help students has not diminished at all. However, we still hope that donations will continue to come in to increase the foundation of the fund and benefit students. Yesterday, colleagues from Datung Tobacco Company sent a letter to this newspaper saying, "Your newspaper's organization of the second Readers' Scholarship Fund is a great benefit to poor students, reducing the pain of dropping out of school.

<p>The 32nd lecture of the Rongwu Lecture Society, the fourth session of the National Studies Lecture, was given by Mr. Yao Taiping on the Classic of Filial Piety. He first stated that the ultimate in filial piety is to extend it to filial piety to Heaven. He recited the Yinggan chapter of the Classic of Filial Piety, extending it from oneself to one's father, to one's ancestors, and then further to the sage, to the emperor, to Heaven, to the Yuan, each level higher and higher, all with the most refined meaning, and finally to communicate with the gods, to shine in the four seas, from the West to the East, from the South to the North, without thinking of disobedience, and then its righteousness is complete. Then Mr. Yang Zhongyi continued to speak, saying that the sage inherited Heaven and established the foundation, and his words were scriptures, all of which were the constants of daily life, and the principles that are extremely easy to practice. Even the foolish and unworthy husband and wife can be told to know and can imitate and act accordingly, so that they can receive the practical benefits of establishing themselves and dealing with the world. Using this to transform people is education, and using this to encourage oneself is learning. What the former sages taught and what the latter sages learned are nothing but this way of being human and the duty that should be fulfilled. If one has the form of a human, and fulfills the principles of being human, then one is called a human. Human beings participate in heaven and earth and are the spirit of all things. Having obtained the human body, one must especially not lose one's personality. Otherwise, the difference between humans and animals is very small. If one only has the human form, but does not understand the way of being human, and violates the goodness of human nature, then one cannot fulfill the nature of human beings, and one will certainly not be able to practice the reality of human beings, and one will live up to this gift of heaven, and one will remove the great defense between humans and animals. Being savage and狂狺, what choice will there be between humans and animals? Li Anxi said, "If you do not fulfill your nature, you cannot fulfill your form; if you do not fulfill your form, you cannot be human." These words are excellent. After the lecture, it was announced that the next session will be on the 18th in the afternoon at 2:30 pm, and it will be a lecture on Yi Xue (I Ching/Book of Changes) and then dismissed.</p>

<p>Vero Company at 845 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession is opened by a Russian and specialises in making women's fashion and fur coats. The company has eight or nine tailors, and the workshop is located in the kitchen. It is stipulated that they rest every Saturday and Sunday. Last Saturday (January 31), the company rested as usual, and the employees went out, leaving only worker Chen Xingde (16 years old, from Anhui) to guard the company. He stayed overnight in the kitchen. Yesterday, the employees returned to the company to work. The tailors planned to enter the workshop, but the door was locked, and there was no response to their calls. They tried to pry open the door, but unexpectedly Chen Xingde had fallen to the ground and died. After inspection, Chen had a knife wound on his throat, which was extremely deep. His hands were tied with ropes, and there were also knife wounds on his hands. It was known that he had been murdered. They immediately reported to the police station, who sent detectives to investigate. It was found that a gray baffle coat worth more than 1,000 yuan was missing from the workshop. It was believed that all the tailors were highly suspected and were taken to the police station for questioning. Chen Xingde's body was sent to the coroner's office for autopsy.</p>

The home also has methods for adoption, foster care, and introduction to apprenticeships. The monthly foster care fee for each refugee child is 55 yuan. The home welcomes those who wish to adopt refugee children or recruit apprentices.</p>

<p>— Gao Jianchen</p>
<p>There is a type of drink that is more thirst-quenching than natrium, has a more wonderful taste, and is also a plant that our country has bestowed upon the world. That is the tangerine, which contains the most abundant vitamin C, "clear spring flows from the teeth, fragrant mist sprays the person" - Su Dongpo said!</p>
<p>The cultivation of tangerines in our country has a history of about five thousand years! Our country's most reliable historical material, Shangshu Yugongpian, has recorded the words "Yangzhou, its package 'tangerines and pomelos,' tin tribute" - pomelos will be discussed in another article. Tracing back to its period, it was actually in the middle of the 23rd century BC. Dongguan Kaogongji also has the saying "Tangerines cross the Huai River and turn into trifoliate oranges, this is the nature of the land." Although Kaogongji is not the original work of the Duke of Zhou in the 12th century BC, according to modern textual research, it is also the work of the Eastern Zhou people in the 8th century BC. As for the textual allusions related to tangerines that are scattered in the works of the philosophers of the Zhou and Qin dynasties, they are even more numerous and cannot be enumerated. Sima Qian even said in the Historical Records of the Commodities Chapter: "Shu Han Jiangling has a thousand tangerine trees, this person is equal to a thousand household marquis." This shows that at that time, there were already people who became rich because of this precious plant, and it can be imagined how close its relationship with the Chinese people is!</p>

<h3 id="e40">More on Nutrition Issues <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— Zhicang</p>
<p>It is not easy to squeeze up to three sheng when buying rice; now it has been changed to two sheng, and the price is three yuan, and the "change" issue is convenient for each other, but therefore, rice is calculated at one hundred and fifty yuan per meter. The days for buying rice have also decreased, which is a last resort, but the people feel that the days to come will be more difficult.</p>
<p>According to hygienists, eating white rice is not very hygienic because of the lack of vitamins. It is better to eat more miscellaneous things - such as soybeans - which is more in line with nutritional standards. At first glance, this cannot help but make those who buy rice at fair prices jump for joy three hundred times, and then after thinking about it, they cannot help but that, and finally stare blankly and do not know how to answer. Because what meets the nutritional standards today may not be cheaper, and the most important thing is still purchasing power to support the vitamin crisis. Corn cakes on the market still cost a dime each, and eating them will not necessarily make you get heart and body wider.</p>
<p>So the hygienist reiterated the slogan of "eating tofu" in addition to rice. It is said that tofu, spinach and the like are the most nutritious, and some babies, because the source of milk powder is cut off, use "soy milk" instead, and they still drink it fat and chubby.</p>
<p>I am very sorry to say that tofu has risen in price again today. The tofu industry in this city has already issued a notice of price increase due to the high cost of manufacturing raw materials. The minimum price of tofu has increased from five cents to one dime. Now, the industry issued another notice on the first of this month that the minimum price is two dimes. The soaring price of tofu has caused hygienists to suffer from the inability to call for help. If they go deep into the world, I think they will also be frowning every day. - This is too "unhygienic". I still remember that Li Bai once mocked Du Fu, saying: "May I ask, have you become so thin since we parted?" But now I want to give this to the modern optimists, the Li Bais.</p>
<p>The facts are all there, and if you want to eat tofu, there must be a substance (solid) in existence, even if it is bean dregs, it is the same. If you want to calculate it, I think that the newly fixed price of tap water is four dimes and two cents per cubic meter, and it is also necessary to review the tea drinking of a group of clear-talking people.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this, like the tofu shop, is a "blood-related" issue, isn't it?</p>
<h3 id="e41">At the Crossroads <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Yu</p>
<p>I have confined myself to this small room for forty days, constantly thinking about the days to come.</p>
<p>I am deeply afraid that people will know I am still alive in this foolish way, so I cannot even muster the courage to go out. But occasionally, when I need something, I have no choice but to harden my heart and run to the crossroads where the cold wind blows from all directions.</p>
<p>However, an acquaintance invariably comes up to me, patting me on the shoulder:</p>
<p>"Is that you—?"</p>
<p>"Oh!" Involuntarily, I turned around, "It's you."</p>
<p>Then, a silent confrontation.</p>
<p>"It's been over a month since we last saw each other," I said first. "Any news from school?"</p>
<p>"I went once, there wasn't a single person... What are you planning to do? In the future!"</p>
<p>I stared wide-eyed, blankly: "What about you?"</p>
<p>"..." Sadly, he glanced at me.</p>
<p>And so, we both shed tears.</p>
<h3 id="e42">A Record of Rushing for the Tram <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— Mi</p>
<p>The title should have been written as "Riding the Tram," but in reality, it's only about "rushing" and "squeezing." As the saying goes, "Things must be called by their proper names," hence I write "A Record of Rushing for the Tram."</p>
<p>8:30 AM, heavy rain. I put on an old overcoat, "wide sleeves swirling," impossible to wear a raincoat on top. After struggling, I had to use the coat for two purposes, braving the rain out of the alley. I really wanted to take a rickshaw, but when I asked the price, it scared me away. Originally, it only cost five or six cents on a sunny day, but now the lion was demanding "three dollars."</p>
<p>In the rain, stepping through the muddy road, I barely made it to the trolleybus station. By this time, there were already more than twenty comrades standing in the rain waiting for the bus. After waiting for about ten minutes, a tram finally arrived slowly. The passengers on the tram were packed like sardines. The driver saw the situation was not right and quickly drove the bus to the other side of the road and stopped. Although some people rushed over, the agile ones got on first, while those who were slow were blocked outside, and they could only sigh at the bus. I didn't have that much courage, so I waited by the station. This happened three times in a row, all passing the station without stopping. I thought to myself, I have to learn a lesson this time and rush to the other side of the road, which is not the station. I thought I could definitely squeeze on, but after waiting for a while, I watched the tram slowly arrive, only to stop at the original station. Realizing there was no hope, I had to rush back. Before I could even reach the station, it had already started moving, as if the machine man was deliberately making fun of me, a person without a raincoat. Finally, after waiting a long time, I barely managed to catch it. Looking at my watch, it was already 9:50 AM. According to office hours, I was fifty minutes late, and my whole body was covered in mud. Rushing for the tram like this, I regret not practicing the 100-meter sprint in school.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Begonia <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>17. Homecoming</p>
<p>Begonia shook his head and sighed.</p>
<p>"I... my illness... is... no..."</p>
<p>"Don't say that, Dad!" Mei Bao squatted down, pressing her face against her father's cotton quilt, her eyes completely red. "As long as you relax, how can your illness not get better?"</p>
<p>Begonia really had endless words he wanted to say to Mei Bao, but when he saw how attached she was to him, his heart ached so much that he couldn't speak anymore. The father and daughter remained silent for more than ten minutes. Just as Mei Bao was about to speak, Old Mrs. Han came upstairs.</p>
<p>Mei Bao glanced sideways at the clock on the table, knowing it was already late, and hurriedly stood up.</p>
<p>"Aunt, please sit, we'll see you later!" She first smiled and said a few polite words to Old Mrs. Han, then nodded to Begonia, who was lying in bed. "Dad, get some rest! I'll be back in less than an hour."</p>
<p>Begonia only moaned softly and turned his face towards the inside of the bed, pretending to be asleep.</p>
<p>How could he possibly fall asleep? He couldn't even sleep well on normal days, let alone today, when Old Man Han had told him such a momentous event that filled him with both worry and joy! In the past, when he lay in bed, he could still clearly hear Old Mrs. Han's snoring as she dozed off in an armchair, but today he heard nothing. Almost all that floated in his mind was Mei Bao's shadow; from the days when they lived in Tianjin to the present, following him as she wandered around Shanghai, working as a singer. He felt that this girl's experiences were simply getting worse year by year! (323)</p>
