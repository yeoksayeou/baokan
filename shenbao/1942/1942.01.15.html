蘇聯的傘兵描摹得淋漓盡致，復開映動人的電影，以爲證明，最後請了一位賣藝的跳躍家來當衆表演，以示使用降落傘的簡捷和愉快。不幸他反把自己的鎖骨和大腿跌斷了，被人用舁床抬出營房，弄得第三營的弟兄們面面相覷，那一天就這樣過去了。　　到了第二天，第三營依舊舉行檢閱。司令官問道，「那幾個人志願加入？當時祇有十二個人從隊伍中站出來。軍曹乃自請向衆人講幾句話，司令官立加許可。這軍曹原是從前帝國時代下來的軍人；他的簡短演辭，不但是從記憶中抄着最好的老文章，且頗能理會當時的歷史背景。他說，上尉和中尉都已經志願加入了。」於是，像演戲樣稍一停頓之後，便大聲喊道，「傘兵們，向右轉，開步走！」　　一百另八條好漢走出了隊伍，和原來的十二個人會合一起。第三營的平時兵力共是一百四十人，現在只剩二十個沒有想像力的留在後面了。鹿特丹，哥林多，埃本厄美爾，和克里特的命運，都已在一九三五年的那天早晨註定了。　　司坦達爾有適宜的氣候和地形，遂被選做德國第一支降落傘部隊的營地。這地方還有一種便利，就是離柏林的空軍部不遠，而仍能避過外國軍事參贊，新聞記者和密探的耳目。</h3>

<h3>Bombing of Rangoon Continues</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 14th - Reuters - Last night's communiqué from the Army and Air Force Command stated that a section of the Rangoon airfield in the north was again bombed by Japanese aircraft at 6:05 PM last night. The Ah-aung-gon area was also bombed, but there were no casualties or property damage. Our aircraft also flew to Japanese-occupied areas for bombing and reconnaissance.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 14th - Havas - An air raid alert was issued here again this morning, followed by multiple aircraft bombing, with most bombs landing in the northern district.</p>
<p>Japanese Forces in Malaya Launch Pincer Movement</p>
<p>Front Line Reaches 80 Miles South of Kuala Lumpur</p>
<p>Pahang Completely Under Japanese Control</p>
<p>Tokyo, 14th - Domei News Agency - British forces south of Kuala Lumpur, unable to withstand the fierce offensive of the Japanese army, retreated into the states of Malacca and Johor today. The Japanese army advanced south in two routes, occupying Tampin (about 80 miles south of Kuala Lumpur on the border of Malacca and Negeri Sembilan states) and Seremban. North of this area, the British forces attempted to rebuild their defensive line. The Japanese offensive has developed into a massive pincer movement today, taking place in the entire region south of Kuala Lumpur and Negeri Sembilan on the Selangor plain on the west coast of Malaya. Its mechanized units penetrated Negeri Sembilan, capturing Tampin this afternoon, advancing about 85 miles in two days. Some British units in the state are now isolated, while the rest are attempting to escape into Johor and Malacca near Gemas. Another route of the Japanese army attacking the British line east of the ports of Port Dickson and Seremban on the west coast entered Seremban this morning, occupying Sepang (both about 60 miles southwest of Kuala Lumpur). The British forces attempted to defend their new positions but collapsed, allowing the Japanese army to directly advance onto the plain and control the state of Malacca, which controls the Strait of Malacca. A Japanese aircraft reconnaissance report today stated that British forces along the coast are currently retreating into Malacca. The British forces in Seremban are retreating into Johor. Meanwhile, Japanese units operating on the east coast of Malaya have now completely controlled Pahang state north of the Pahang River. The vanguard reported that British resistance on the border of Johor state has been defeated. The British 9th Regiment escaped into the dense mountain jungles of the central region. The main Japanese force is currently pursuing them.</p>
<p>British Reinforcements Arrive from India</p>
<p>Madras, India, 14th - Reuters - Sir Arthur Hope, Governor of Madras, announced last night that a large number of reinforcements are being rushed to support the Malayan and Singaporean defenders in preparation for a counteroffensive. If British forces can hold Singapore, India will not have to worry about Japanese invasion by land or sea. Even in the air, the closest Japanese airfield is in Thailand, 1,300 miles away, so there will be no large-scale air raids for the time being.</p>
<p>London, 13th - Reuters - War analysts say that British fighter planes seem to have been kept around Singapore in the past and not dispersed throughout the peninsula. If the Japanese can break through the Seremban defense line, their next target will be Muar in Johor, which is only 90 miles from Singapore and has open terrain suitable for tanks. The British will have to use all their aircraft to deal with it. The airfields available for defending Singapore are an important issue. It is known that the Dutch have built several secret airfields, some of which must be on Sumatra, the closest point being only 60 miles from Singapore, and fighter planes can provide valuable assistance to the defenders.</p>
<p>Celebes East Coast: Kema City Occupied</p>
<p>Tokyo, 14th - Haito News Agency - According to an official announcement here on Tuesday night, Japanese naval special landing forces have landed on the east coast of Celebes, occupying Kema city (Kema), the northeasternmost point of the island. In the air battle during the landing, seven enemy aircraft were shot down. Another Japanese unit has occupied Tondano, southeast of Manado. It is expected that the Japanese forces advancing from the east and west coasts of Celebes will meet in the center of the island.</p>
<p>Estimated Military Strength of the Dutch East Indies</p>
<p>Tokyo, 14th - Haito News Agency - "Asahi Shimbun" published an estimate of the military strength of the Dutch East Indies yesterday, stating that the Dutch East Indies regular army currently has 72,000 men, plus 25,000 volunteers. The Dutch East Indies Air Force currently has 100 fighter planes, 80 bombers, 90 reconnaissance planes, and 100 seaplanes. The Navy currently has 6 cruisers, 10 destroyers, 15 submarines, and other ships.</p>
<p>London, 14th - Reuters - Military observers say that the Dutch army did not intend to defend Tarakan Island. The Dutch forces will apparently fight the Japanese at Kula-hasa, where the Dutch elite troops are stationed. Furthermore, the Dutch have built no fewer than fifty secret air force bases in Borneo, which will be a great help. The Dutch East Indies ordered all European residents between the ages of 18 and 41 to serve in the military a year ago. According to various sources, Java now has 50,000 European troops, all highly mechanized, and about 500,000 national defense reserves, as well as numerous indigenous militias. In addition, the Dutch East Indies has 2,000 aircraft and a strong navy.</p>
<p>Panama Canal Zone Under U.S. Navy Control</p>
<p>U.S. and Uruguay Sign Lease Agreement</p>
<p>Western Hemisphere Cooperation Enters New Stage</p>
<p>Washington, 13th - Havas - President Roosevelt, at the request of the Panamanian government, signed an order today stipulating that the areas at both ends of the Panama Canal will be under the complete control of the U.S. Navy. The President also told reporters that special regulations will apply to all ships sailing through the Panama Canal and the adjacent waters of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans in order to "defend the Canal, strengthen national defense, and maintain the safety of ships." Those who disobey will have their ships confiscated and their sailors severely punished.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 14th - Haito News Agency - Washington dispatches report that the United States has signed a lease agreement with Uruguay, which was signed yesterday at the U.S. Department of State. The Uruguayan Ambassador to the United States said at the time that the agreement stipulates that the United States will supply the Uruguayan army and navy with weapons, the quantity of which was not specified. The United States has now signed lease agreements with eight American countries, namely Uruguay, Paraguay, Brazil, Cuba, Bolivia, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Nicaragua.</p>
<p>Washington, 13th - Havas - Secretary of State Hull told reporters that after the United States and Uruguay signed an agreement stipulating that the U.S. Lend-Lease Act would be extended to Uruguay, the cooperation policy of the American republics has entered a new stage. The signing of this agreement coincided with the establishment of joint U.S.-Mexico defense and the opening of the Pan-American Conference in the capital of Brazil, but it was only a coincidence.</p>
<p>Pan-American Conference Opens Today</p>
<p>Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 14th - Haito News Agency - This Pan-American Conference is scheduled to open here tomorrow. Everything is ready. About 150 delegates from various countries have arrived, not counting the journalists from various countries. It is scheduled to last for ten days and is expected to have several important resolutions.</p>
<p>Washington, 14th - Havas - The Pan-American Conference will open tomorrow. The Paraguayan delegation is expected to propose a motion advocating that all South American countries unanimously sever diplomatic relations with the Axis powers. Officials here generally believe that this motion will be unanimously passed, and say that this is the main goal of the United States for this conference. However, according to news from Buenos Aires, Argentina, Foreign Minister Guani is strongly opposed to this motion. Therefore, diplomatic circles here feel unexpectedly optimistic about the official's sudden embrace. However, the State Department seems to have sufficient reason to believe that Argentina will be able to abandon its prejudices at the last hour and jointly support the above proposal with other South American countries.</p>

The Japanese submarine then quickly submerged to avoid attack by destroyers, so it did not ascertain whether the U.S. aircraft carrier had been hit and sunk. However, two loud explosions were heard at the time, so it is believed that the ship has been lost.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 14th - Haito News Agency - The Imperial General Headquarters announced at noon today that the Japanese Red Cross ship "Harbin Maru" (5,167 tons) has sunk in the South China Sea.

<p>East of Mozhaisk, Soviets Break Through German Lines</p>
<p>German Counterattack Forces Soviets to Retreat</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th - Havas - According to German military announcements, the Red Army in the central sector of the Eastern Front, regardless of the severe cold weather, broke through the German lines east of Mozhaisk on November 11. A German division then launched a fierce counterattack, forcing the Red Army in the area to retreat to new positions. Fierce battles lasted all day in several locations. The Soviet army suffered heavy losses, with about 300 soldier corpses on the battlefield. We also captured a large amount of Soviet military supplies. Our dive bombers and fighter groups also operated in the central sector, and Soviet barracks and strongholds were bombed by our planes. The Red Army's columns suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 13th - Havas - The Neue Zürcher Zeitung recently reported that the tactics currently used by the Red Army on the Eastern Front are the same as those used by the German army in the initial attacks on the Soviet Union last summer and autumn. In other words, the Red Army takes advantage of the German army's rest to launch counterattacks. Their purpose is not to occupy a city or a point, but to encircle and annihilate German units. Although the German army is not threatened by this tactic, the German army may be forced to retreat to Mozhaisk and Vyazma as a result of the continued counterattacks by the Red Army's division. The key to this line lies in the city of Rzhev, which the German army is currently fighting hard to defend. As for the Red Army's landing in the Crimea with a small number of troops, it can be said to be a surprise victory. In short, although the Red Army has a temporary advantage, the situation may change once the German army gets used to winter warfare.</p>

<p>Chairman of the Trade Commission, Zou Lin, Takes Office</p>
<p>Chongqing, 14th - After Chen Guangfu resigned as Chairman of the Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Finance appointed Zou Lin to succeed him. He took office on the 13th. Since July 1, 1940, the commission has been ordered by the ministry to become an administrative agency for managing export goods, no longer handling business. Business matters involving foreign trade were assigned to the Fuxing Commercial Company, Fuhua Trading Company, and China Tea Company on that day. As for the financial matters of the commission, before July 1, 1940, the Ministry of Finance allocated a total of 100 million yuan in funds, including 20 million yuan at the beginning of its establishment in 1937, 50 million yuan in 1938 to handle barter trade with Russia and the United Kingdom, and 30 million yuan in 1939 to handle barter trade with the United States to repay debts, for a total of 100 million yuan in funds. These funds were ordered to be transferred to the above-mentioned three companies in July 1940, including 30 million yuan to the Fuxing Company, 50 million yuan to the Danghua Company, and 20 million yuan to the China Tea Company. In addition, there were more than 30 million yuan in net profits over the years, which were allocated to other special funds or lent to the three companies as working capital and reported to the ministry. At the end of 1940, the commission prepared a detailed report, profit and loss statement, statement of funds and assets, and detailed tables of various purchases and sales, which were submitted to the Ministry of Finance and then to the highest authorities for review. The transfer of new and old positions was very simple because the commission did not handle business and had been a purely administrative agency for more than a year. The transfer has been underway for more than ten days and is expected to be completed in one week.</p>

<p>Local Special Dispatch, Haito News Agency - According to Sydney radio, a heat wave has hit Australia, causing 100 deaths.</p>
<p>Special Article in This Newspaper: A Brief History of German Paratroopers (3)</p>
<p>Hitler first ordered Göring to organize a paratrooper force in 1935. At this time, Göring already had his own "Lifeguard" regiment, expanded from the police force, solely for the purpose of showing off during inspections. He readily selected the third battalion of this regiment to be reorganized into the first paratrooper force.</p>
<p>The officers of the battalion were naturally surprised by the news, but they were all willing in their hearts. As for the sergeants and privates, most of them were married and preferred to stay put, so they had to be persuaded. Thus, Propaganda Minister Goebbels was ordered to try his skills at the third battalion. He first gave a speech to everyone, vividly depicting the Soviet paratroopers, and then showed moving films as proof. Finally, he invited a performing jumper to demonstrate the simplicity and pleasure of using a parachute. Unfortunately, he broke his collarbone and thigh and was carried out of the barracks on a stretcher, leaving the brothers of the third battalion looking at each other. That day passed just like that.</p>
<p>The next day, the third battalion held an inspection as usual. The commander asked, "Who volunteers to join?" Only twelve people stood out from the ranks at that time. The sergeant then asked to say a few words to everyone, and the commander immediately gave permission. This sergeant was a soldier from the former imperial era. His brief speech not only copied the best old articles from memory, but also understood the historical background at the time. He said, "The captain and lieutenant have already volunteered to join." Then, after a slight pause like in a play, he shouted loudly, "Paratroopers, turn right, forward march!"</p>
<p>One hundred and eight good men walked out of the ranks and joined the original twelve. The peacetime strength of the third battalion was 140 men, and now only twenty unimaginative men were left behind. The fate of Rotterdam, Corinth, Eben-Emael, and Crete was already determined that morning in 1935.</p>
<p>Stendal, with its suitable climate and terrain, was chosen as the camp for Germany's first paratrooper force. There was also a convenience to this location, which was that it was not far from the Air Force Department in Berlin, while still being able to avoid the ears and eyes of foreign military attachés, journalists, and spies.</p>

<p>Shanghai Municipal Council Convenes Meeting to Discuss Future Rice Supply</p>
<p>Rice Shops Closed Plan to Sell National Rice Exclusively</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council convened a meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss future rice supply matters and the operating guidelines for rice shops. As for the issue of relief for closed rice shops, the rice shop owners had not formally submitted a request to the authorities, but only sent representatives a few days ago to verbally request relief from the Shanghai Municipal Council. According to Deputy Secretary-General Pearce of the council, if the rice shop owners send a formal document to the council, the council will convene a meeting to discuss specific measures to provide relief.</p>
<p>Rice Shops Closed Plan to Sell National Rice</p>
<p>The rice shops ordered to cease operations by the authorities in the two concessions only account for a portion of the shops within the concessions, totaling about 300. These 300 rice shops have approximately 2,200 employees. Because rice shops in western Shanghai, the southern city, and Zhabei have not received closure notices, these rice shops have applied to the authorities for business licenses and are changing to other businesses. However, some rice shops are still continuing to find ways to request the authorities to allow them to operate and sell national rice in order to make a living.</p>
<p>Quantity of Foreign Rice Allocated Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Rice Needs Office previously designated the extraction of foreign rice from the Pinghe Public Warehouse. The rice was unsealed and released yesterday, totaling 2,050 bags. The Jin Cheng, Luo Qifu, Maotai, and China warehouses were signed yesterday, and will continue to extract foreign rice today, approximately 7,000 bags, sufficient for retail by the rice shops. Yesterday was Wednesday, and all rice shops in the two concessions were closed for retail sales in accordance with the Shanghai Municipal Council's regulations. Therefore, it is expected that the retail situation in the rice shops today will still be crowded. Since the trial implementation of the finger-dyeing method, the police must check the fingers of the retail crowds one by one. The time spent is not more economical than the white powder numbering method, and there are still those who wash off the color each time and repurchase rice. This is worth noting.</p>
<p>Hopes for Reduction or Exemption of Cash Counting Fees</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice and Food Office's collection section is handled by Li Hua Foreign Firm. Starting yesterday, each 1,000 yuan in cash paid by rice shops for foreign rice will be charged a handling fee of 5.1 yuan. The rice shops expressed disapproval, as money exchange shops only charge 5 yuan per 10,000 yuan, while now it requires 50 yuan. It is hoped that the fee can be waived or reduced.</p>
<p>Situation of Flour Allocation from Unsealed Warehouses</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Municipal Council's Flour Office had distributed all the flour stored at the Fuxin No. 7 Factory, Fuxin No. 2 Factory, and Fufeng Factory, yesterday it continued to open the flour warehouses at Donglai, China, and Jincheng. The flour stored at Donglai Warehouse was completely distributed yesterday, and three-tenths of the China Warehouse was also distributed. The Jincheng Warehouse has not yet been allocated. The total amount of flour supplied to various noodle product merchants yesterday was approximately 6,000 bags.</p>
<p>Coal Briquette Users Must Register</p>
<p>Since the authorities in the two concessions stipulated that tricycles are allowed to transport coal briquettes, the citizens are very pleased and believe that there will be no shortage of coal briquette fuel in the future. However, in order to prevent unscrupulous citizens from hoarding large quantities of coal briquettes, the two municipal councils have instructed all coal briquette users to register with the mechanized coal briquette factories starting today, so that they can be supplied at a fair price according to the registered amount each month. It is now known that all coal briquette users in the city have registered with the coal briquette factories, and according to news from the industry association, there are now more than 2,000 households.</p>
<p>Public Utilities Continue as Usual</p>
<p>Japanese Side Has No New Measures</p>
<p>Trams Have All Been Put Back into Service</p>
<p>The Japanese side announced that a subsidiary of the China Central Development Corporation will take over the public utility companies of British and American merchants in the city. However, the management offices of the companies have not heard anything about the actual significance of the Japanese takeover. As of yesterday afternoon, the Japanese side had not taken any new actions in the public utility companies of British and American merchants, and no new Japanese representatives had arrived at the companies. Therefore, at present, the status of the public utility companies of Allied merchants seems to be the same as in the past five weeks. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the Japanese side has appointed supervisors to be stationed in each of the public utility companies to manage finances. Some of these supervisors include representatives from the China Central Development Corporation, such as the supervisor of the Shanghai Telephone Company. According to inquiries at the tram company's traffic office at 80 Hardoon Road, the number of trams operating on the company's lines has been reduced by half since the 8th of last month, to about 50 trams. Recently, the stations have been crowded with passengers. In addition to allocating trams to the Hongkou line, all trams in the factory have been released.</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Council Informs Residents That Household Registration Must Be Accurately Reported</p>
<p>Related to the Future Supply of Daily Necessities</p>
<p>The Public Concession has now begun a census, carried out by detectives dispatched by the police stations. About three-tenths of the work has been completed. All residents must provide accurate information when police personnel investigate their household registration and must not fabricate or inflate their reports. Otherwise, they will be punished according to the law or will not be able to enjoy various rights. The information that residents must report includes: Population, Gender (separately), Age, Native Place, Detailed Address, Occupation. Notices have been posted everywhere to urge residents to pay attention and comply with the regulations, regardless of nationality. It is understood that the Shanghai Municipal Council's purpose in taking this measure is to ascertain the exact number of people in Shanghai and the monthly supply of daily necessities.</p>
<p>China-America Radio Station Resumes Broadcasting</p>
<p>After the closure of various radio wireless stations in the city, five radio stations, including Shanghai, Da Mei, Jianhua, French Municipal Council, and Huesheng, resumed operation. Other radio stations have not yet resumed. Starting today, China-America Radio Station (XMHA) began to resume broadcasting music, records, and news programs. It is said that other closed radio stations are also considering resuming broadcasting. However, in order to save electricity, the municipal council is very strict in restricting the broadcasting time of various radio stations.</p>
<p>Another Thief Apprehended in the Washington Watch Store Robbery Case</p>
<p>The Washington Watch Store on Jing'an Temple Road was robbed last November of 500 watches worth more than 120,000 yuan. The New Gate and Old Gate Police Stations have arrested the perpetrators Tao Yaofu, Lu Yonglin, Dai Jinsheng, Ni Xiaolong, Zhou Wenda, Zhao Yonghua, and Shen Jianqu, and recovered dozens of watches. They were sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. However, the two fugitives in this case, Gao Yanling (also known as Bao Yanling) and Wu Hongfei, are still at large. Wang Jinsheng, the Chinese Deputy Inspector of the Old Gate Police Station, has learned that Gao Yanling is hiding in Tianxing Town, Xixiang, Haimen. He took a Chinese detective to Haimen and arrested Gao.</p>
<p>Second Deposit Withdrawals Now Available at HSBC Bank</p>
<p>Financial Changes in Luzon Greatly Affect the City</p>
<p>All Allied Banks Implement Final Liquidation</p>
<p>Second Deposit Withdrawals Now Available at HSBC Bank</p>
<p>Financial Changes in Luzon Greatly Affect the City</p>
<p>News from Manila reports that the Japanese-occupied areas of Luzon Island have completely banned foreign currency transactions, with the exception of military scrip and U.S. dollars. The foreign exchange market in Shanghai has been strongly affected by this news, causing foreign exchange rates to decline further. Tobacco exchange shops have even stopped buying some foreign currencies.</p>
<p>Second Batch of Withdrawals Pending Liquidation</p>
<p>Of the nine Allied banks in the city that reopened on Monday morning, only HSBC issued a second batch of deposits to depositors yesterday morning. The remaining eight banks are still limited to withdrawing the first batch of deposits, that is, a total of no more than 2,000 yuan per household since the outbreak of the Pacific War. However, these eight banks are expected to obtain permission from the Japanese liquidator to start paying the second batch of personal deposits starting next week. According to banking circles, HSBC was able to pay the second batch of deposits earlier because the Japanese supervisor of the bank has been appointed as the final liquidator. The supervisors of the other eight Allied banks will be replaced by liquidators, so they must re-examine all banking affairs.</p>
<p>Checks for Public Utilities Paid in Cash</p>
<p>Foreign banks have approved the cashing of checks issued for payment to the four major public utility companies. Checks for payment of Shanghai Municipal Council taxes have also been approved for cashing. However, depositors issuing these checks must still deduct the same amount of cash from their permitted withdrawals. In addition, HSBC Bank still accepts checks from Japanese Allied banks as deposits, while other Allied banks do not accept them.</p>
<p>New Tram Departure Times for Each Line</p>
<p>The latest regulations for the departure times of trams on each line are as follows: Line 1 at 6:05 AM, Line 2 at 6:30 AM, Line 3 at 6:00 AM, Line 9 at 6:50 AM, Line 16 at 5:23 AM, Line 17 at 6:33 AM, Line 18 at 7:15 AM, and Line 19 at 7:10 AM. The earliest arrival time at the depot is 9:15 AM, and the latest arrival time is 10:50 AM. Tram lines 5, 6, and 7 are still out of service.</p>
<p>Construction Industry Increases Wages</p>
<p>Construction workers in this city, including cement tiers, iron bundlers, and three-in-one soil workers, have requested an increase in wages due to the inability to maintain their livelihoods due to rising living costs. After several rounds of negotiations between labor and management, it has been decided to increase wages by 30% based on a standard of 1.20 yuan per day, totaling 1.56 yuan per day, excluding meals.</p>

<h3>Japanese Military Advances in Southeast Asia Threaten the Australian Commonwealth; Allied Powers Prepare for Counteroffensive</h3>
<p>Havas Dispatch from the Capital of Switzerland, 13th: The "Basler Nachrichten" recently published a dispatch from its London correspondent stating that semi-official sources here acknowledge the situation in Southeast Asia is extremely serious. The Japanese army's advance in Malaya and the Dutch East Indies has posed a direct threat to the Australian Commonwealth. Those in charge are also well aware that the Japanese army will continue to exploit its numerical superiority to attempt a fatal blow before Allied reinforcements arrive in Singapore. The Japanese landing in the Dutch East Indies aims to establish a base for further conquests, turning the archipelago into a true bridge between Southeast Asia and the Australian Commonwealth. Australian politicians are keenly aware of the current situation. For example, Prime Minister Curtin stated in a speech on the 10th of this month that Australia has never faced such a grave situation. Naval figures believe Japan will not mobilize its entire fleet of warships and submarines until it fully controls the Dutch East Indies. However, in the current stage of the war, Japan, with its limited forces, seems capable of continuing landings at other strategic points in the Dutch East Indies. Fortunately, the Dutch East Indies authorities have already taken various defensive measures, but due to the vast area and dispersed islands, it is difficult to cover every aspect. The only way for the Allied Powers to stop the Japanese advance is to have a strong advantage in land and air forces. As this is difficult to achieve quickly, it is generally acknowledged that it is currently difficult to prevent the Japanese from continuing their advance. In short, the Japanese army's acquisition of new bases in the Dutch East Indies will severely threaten Singapore. Furthermore, the Japanese army's use of new type twelve-ton tanks in combat is another threat to Malaya. One side is strong enough to defend itself, while the other becomes a "natural base" for a counteroffensive in the future, because a counteroffensive against the Japanese strongholds recently acquired in the Southwest Pacific will eventually have to be carried out.</p>
<p>Havas Dispatch from Washington, 13th: Since the rapid advance of the Japanese army in Southeast Asia, Australia's position has attracted attention from all sides. Today, when President Roosevelt received reporters, a reporter asked whether Australian army and navy experts would soon come to the United States. The President replied that military experts from various Allied countries, including Australia, would come to the United States, but would not need to stay in the United States for a long time, and would take turns visiting various Allied countries for inspection. Furthermore, there is no need to convene another meeting of Allied military experts at this time.</p>
