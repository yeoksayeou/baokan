<h3>十　沙漠之王國（三）</h3>
<p>沙地阿剌伯的全貌　兩個聖城</p>
<p>讓我們還是回到西部來吧、我們似乎忘記了一件重要的史實，我們都知道沙地阿剌伯是回敎之發源地，是全世界回敎徒之老家，但對於它具有歷史意味的兩個聖城—麥加與麥地那—我們還沒提過呢？那末也讓我們現在略爲說點吧！</p>
<p>麥加的　名是Mlecca，但也可寫作Mecqne或Mekke，屬於漢志土國境內，在紅海東一百公哩，高四百公呎，東部爲Djebon-Kobeis山所圍繞；全城即沿此山脚用石頭建成；遠在羅馬帝國時代，麥加道地方已經是一個繁華之大商埠了，Ptolomee之地理解說上，就會提起過Makoraba名字，當時主要之貿易爲香料；在回敎未創立前，麥加係由Koreischites族統治，並是羣衆宗敎集會之所在，隨後摩罕謨德誕生，伊斯蘭敎創立後，這地方才被目爲聖地，Al-Madje大主敎即位後，爲着容納衆多之朝拜香客，乃動工興建巨大模形之回敎寺院，屋頂均呈圖形，並於周圍堅立七個尖塔，該寺建築宏偉，極高麗之能事，內部於Caaba中並置一黑色寳石，由世界各處因慕聚而來之杳客，披着一種毛織物剪成的Ir'harn，橫繞於腰部，根據回敎夕禮節，調先繞Caaba七次，這叫做Fouaf，接着還須由Sufa聖門至Merowa來往跑七次（Sai），除此以外一個忠實之回敎徒，尙須至Arabat山祈禱一整下午，還須在Maura作祭祀，原因摩罕謨德曾在此受難，關於回敎之禮節，異常繁複，像其他宗敎一樣，道許多禮節當中自然有着無數動人的故事與史實，並不是全無意義的。</p>
<p>大戰前，每年至麥加朝靈之回敎徒總不下卅萬，在一個回敎徒看出，如其一生中夫麥加朝聖一次，那末就像幹了一件圓滿功德，如果到沒能去聖城　拜，那末眞是畢生最大的憾事，怕死後連靈魂也是不安的，就說我國，過去每年從靑海新疆去的回敎徒也頗可觀，大致由海道前往的人，都由及達（Djeddal）登陸，由陸路去的則多半經越印度　地。</p>
<p>麥加平時的人口大致是六萬人，有一半人的職業都　寄託在香容身上的，他們開旅店；茶館當響導，經營小本生意，麥加之繁華完全是依賴着過路的客人，這幾年因爲戰事關係，朝拜的香客銳减，而麥加之　容亦因此一落千丈。</p>
<p>在麥加住得長久點的人，都養成一種熟練的商業技巧，他們自己製造一種極精緻之金銀鑲器，每年香客都要購買好些留爲紀念，至於大規摸的商業差不多都操縱在印度人手裏。</p>
<p>從中古時代起麥加一直在異族的統治下，最初屬Abbassides，一二六九年屬埃及，一五一七年歸十耳其，一八○三年屬華哈壁族，一八一七年歸倂入奥圖曼王朝版圖，直至一九二四年始再度爲華哈壁族佔領，但不管連續受外族統治，事實上因爲它所處宗敎特別之地位，與政治不大相聯，實際的統治者則是屬於回敎之大主敎，擁有一切特權。　回敎之聖地除麥加外，尙有麥地那，（Medina）亦稱Ek　Medina或Medinte-en-Nebi摩罕謨傯之墓　葬於此，麥地那建於阿刺伯高原上，附近有水草，由此有鐵路通克拉克，紀元六二二年時摩罕謨德避難來此，同年訂爲回教紀　。（Hegire）麥地那之回敎寺院曾先後修建多次，一二五七年曾毀於火，目前之大寺院係由埃及王Khaid-bey於一四八七年所建，麥地那除於糜罕謨德生前曾在此說道外，並是女徒Dnan　Abou-Bekr之葬地，故一直目爲聖地，每年往麥加朝聖之香客總不肯錯過機會來此地待上幾天。</p>
<p>在沙地阿刺伯一切文化之標準都是建築在回敎上之敎條上的，我們自然不否認同敎之敎義，在某方面是具有極大之敎育意義，但多少年來山於它嚴厲的敎規的束縛，事實上文化的前進就不可避免的受　阻力，回敎的傳播因爲藉着武力做後盾，故能在極短時期內散　阿刺伯全境，除了頑强之亞西爾人直至十八世紀初始接收外，餘在七八世紀時均巳受此宗敎感染，阿刺伯人在古代是個智慧具有高超文化的民族，但因受着回敎之束縛，一直未能發展，如今仍遺留在半開化的邊緣山，近來執政者亦羣起摹倣土耳其，伊朗等國對回敎處置之辦法，着手改良，我們想在不久它已逝的優秀文明會得再　遠播海外的。</p>

<p>該城高於水平面一千公尺，周圍花草繁茂；圖右之堡壘，即為回教創始之穆罕默德葬地。</p>

<p>管氏所藏世所罕見</p>
<p>搜藏鈔票和搜集郵票、同樣的是一種良好嚐好、更可以說是一種有意義的娛樂方法、它們都具有歷史和地理的價値、現在有不少的人、染有集郵的嗜好、搜藏鈔票、却是很少聽見、這次洞庭山管江民君繼着先人集鈔嗜好、搜藏中國歷代的鈔票達四千餘種、雖然不能保證沒有遺漏、但是這有歷史價値的貢獻、已經是難能可貴、</p>
<p>中國歷朝的幣制、大都以硬幣為主體、發行鈔票、祇是輔助性質、所以流行很少、管君所搜藏的包括唐·宋·元·明·淸歷代的通用寳鈔、以迄於民國各省各地所發行的各種砂票、以及軍用票代價券等等、無不應有盡有、</p>
<p>這次所展覽的鈔票中、以唐朝為最古、距今一二九二年、至於唐朝以前是否也有鈔票發打、那麼有待於考古家的發現、最近的為民國三十年中央銀行所發行的鈔票、距今未足一年、最大的數額為一萬元、最少的數額為一分、　　自唐以來搜羅完備</p>
<p>現在把幾種珍貴的歷代鈔票、約略記載於後、以供前往參觀者的參考、　唐　有大唐寳鈔壹貫係唐代永徽平間發行、作錢一千、通行三十三年、距今一二九二年、及大唐便民寳鈔百貫、唐天佑年間發行，當時內此大鈔頗少投入民間、可稱罕世珍品、　宋　有大宋通行寳鈔一百貫、係宋太祖建隆年間發行、作錢一百、流行頗久、距今巳九八二年、</p>
<p>元　有庫足兌憑票存足銀五十兩、係順帝至正年間發行、値銀五十兩、當時可購良田數百畝、距今五八八年、時値朱元璋起義於滁州（見圖）又大元軍餉寳鈔。係元朝元世祖至元年間發行、制錢四百、距今六七一年、時値蒙古建國、　　　明　有大明通行寳鈔、洪武年間發行、距今五七叫年、及朱元璋建都應天時所發行的通行寶鈔、</p>
<p>淸　有大淸通行寳鈔、咸豐朝發行、距今八十一年、及光緒三十一年裕寗官銀錢局所發行的通用寳鈔、距今三十七年、尤有可貴者、為米票一種、該票係光緒十七年天災後由恩豐倉散發之米票、計每人每季可得米一石八斗、平均每日計二升、此亦計口授糧之一種先例也、　　　民國　紀元後各省各地所發行的鈔票、更是不勝枚舉、其中珍貴的也很多、如廣東省銀行於民國七年所發行五十元一張的兌換券、同時却另有一張民國三年所發行的五十元兌換券陳列在一起、驟視之這二張鈔票絕無軒輊、其中的曲折則有待於前往參觀者的思索、其他如北伐時所發行的軍用票、和西北蒙古等邊陲用鈔票靡不搜羅完　、</p>

<p>山芋亁到銷不寂、市勢帶穩、計開山東山芋乾一百包、價一百〇九元、送到、</p>
<h3>使用鈔票挑剔嚴</h3>
<p>市上對於鈔票行使，頗多挑剔，大致對於票上寫有字跡或蓋有印章者不收，查於鈔票上塗寫蓋章，確乎不是應有之事，原此種習慣之由來，固有出於故意亂塗亂寫，但亦由於檢察難周，致常有偽票發生，辨別不易，授受之間，必欲授之者簽字或蓋章負責，俾有假鈔發見，向其退換，不若商店銀錢業以鈔票當場點明，離開櫃　不負責也，此種風氣，自有銀元以來，相沿未替，今如對於寫有字跡或蓋有私章店號之鈔票，因不知而收受者實居多數，尤其原刀鈔票夾雜更不在少，一時疏忽收進，用出為難，雖掉換破鈔辦法，固有「印有漫寫文宇」在不兌換之列，要知此項損失，往往不在寫者蓋者，而在無意中之收受者，故以為「鈔票之淸潔運動」，固應提創，而在未提創前，巳蓋已寫之鈔票，理應籌一救濟辦法，不應一概拒用，計之便者，莫如公吿時期，於其時期以內，一律收兌，逾期再有塗寫蓋章之鈔票，概不使用。</p>
<p>其次為破損程者問題，邇來對於鈔票之四周邊緣，稍有破裂，尤其是鈔票對折之中縫兩端，凡經使用稍多之鈔票，大都分裂，或摺痕稍深，近於破裂，或紙張軟熟，將　霉爛，即有回絕不用，請換一張，用鈔者深覺左右為難，如遇見此等鈔票，處處向付鈔者請調，則必遭其詈辱，以為如此鈔票不能用，那有這許多新票給你用，你若收受下來，使用全商店小菜塲公用事業，麻煩不堪，幾難理喻，這種苦痛，一言難盡，而况此種破碎程度，實際上尙不至四分夕一，何以水　捐項，動輒挑剔如是夕酷</p>
<p>因破損在二分之一以上者不兌，市上對於鈔票為兩半者，雖一切完全，亦不使用，未免太酷，甚至中縫經使用過久，自然發生之孔眼，亦不允通用，似此使人物質上精神上同感援失。</p>
<p>一方面勸大家不要再濫筆頭，亂塗寫，蓋圖章，更不要將鈔票對折之後再對折，層層摺痕，易於破損，或捲成一束，或濕手拿取（經水更不可）或團塞袋內，至多是對折，最好是原張平放，若能於折痕之內，以棉絮夾之，不易斷裂，更覺有益。</p>

<p>七月一日報載全滬國產影片戲院聯合啟事云：「茲因白報紙來源缺乏，敝院等議定自七月一日起，將本事說明書一律暫行取銷，好在國產影片情節極易明瞭，事非得已，謹希各界觀衆諒察為幸」。具名者為大上海等十六家戲院。</p>
<p>從這條啟事，我們可以知道，以後看電影之前，再也不能手執說明書，領略劇情的大概，同時也無法消磨等待開映的悶寂了。</p>
<p>記得戰前，頭輪戲院說明書有三頁之多，三輪亦有二頁，照片文字並美，且有演員表。最近，逐漸縮小，三輪說明書只有戰前戲票那樣大小，有人叫牠豆腐干，倒是名副其實。現在連豆腐干也沒有，實不勝　昔之感。</p>
<p>沒有說明書，並非絕對壞事。好比一本偵探劇，或是恐怖劇，你如果沒有知道本事，劇情也許更　抓住你的感情。如果你巳經知道劇情的始末結局，你甚至會好笑那偵探先生走大圈子的費力。終之不會有十二分的與極注意劇情的起伏。所以有很多人看電影，從不　先看說明書，至多在事後參考而巳、</p>
<p>現在說明書被廢了，對於有經騐的觀衆，是沒有多大不便，可是大多數觀衆，他們對於電影中的變化是不大懂的，好如他們看見銀幕上剛才演的是某一時間，　在一個演員說了一句：「×年前，那時……」，銀幕上突然換了×年前的事了。剛才眼看葬下去的人物，却　活着做買賣之類，眞叫他們摸不着頭路。所以廢了說明書，對於多數觀衆是件很不便的事，對於戲院營業恐也不無損失。</p>
<p>筆者提議一個救濟辦法，就是把說明書印在戲票上，白底小號黑字（兩面印）。日期，鐘點可用淡紅或淡黃等大字加印其上。被撕去的一端儘量减狹，上印院名。</p>
<p>本事之中，簡單明白的實在少見，大多嚕哩嚕囌，今後務使字數减至無可再减，而以不損失精華為度。不知大家以為如何？</p>
<h3>另外一個意見</h3>
<p>— 雲子</p>
<p>因白報紙來源缺乏，而暫行取銷影戲說明書一事，筆者略微有一點提議，貢獻給電影院，以補救沒有說明書的缺點。</p>
<p>緣說明書一物，它的仟務是說明電影故事的大概，或介紹演員飾演角色的陣容，和下期公映影片的廣吿等，在一般的觀衆，是很需要一張說明書，來幫助他們理解電影內容。如今，因為白報紙的來源缺乏而取銷了說明書，對於理解力較底的觀衆，或聽不懂國語的觀衆，未免大有妨碍，現在我想出兩個方法，以補救這缺點</p>
<p>第一，在影院的前部買票處等的走廊上，裝置新片預吿的廣吿壁廚，影院可利用它來做一張公共的說明書，用白紙寫了「演員表」，「職員表」和「故事」，貼在壁廚裹，那末，觀衆看了迢壁廚裏的佈吿，也勝於看過一張說明書了。</p>
<p>第二，是在影片的片頭「演員表」「職員表」以後，略映一些「故事概略」，那末，觀衆在未映之前，也可以知道這電影所述的故事，發生在何時，何地等了。</p>
<h3>「活動說明書」</h3>
<p>— 耑員</p>
<p>影戲說明書對於觀衆瞭解劇情的幫助是很大的，因為上海的觀衆，不一定個個都懂得國語，一旦廢除說明書，豈不更弄得他們「山東人吃麥冬，一懂弗懂」。旣不懂劇情，又不懂對白，那常然是極不便利的事、</p>
<p>今在某小型報上見有「活動說明書」之建議：蓋所謂「活動說明書」者，就是在電影開映的十分鐘前，由一口才伶俐之女郞，將劇情用國語滬語像講故事一樣的講述一遍，這樣，才可以彌補了沒有說明書的缺憾，而且比觀衆自己看說明書更有興趣，我以為，　的確倒是値是介紹給國片影院採用的一個好辦法呢。</p>
<h3>關於「蝴蝶夫人」</h3>
<p>— 莉蕾</p>
<p>中聯出品公映第一聲九日起在大光明獻映</p>
<p>「蝴蝶夫人」將於九日起在大光明大戲院獻映了，這是中聯成立後付諸公映的第聲，全滬觀衆對於她渴望的熱忱，恐怕正相等於中聯對於這部作品的重視。</p>
<p>改編後的「蝴蝶夫人」，有兩點是値得一提的：　男主角已不再是一個「薄倖郞了，他像蝴蝶姑娘一樣，也是一個封建制度掌握中的伴虜。　這里面每一個人物都是使人同情的可憐虫，這是足够强調了李萍倩在「或向「蝴蝶夫人」中所說的　反（反封建，反階級，反大家庭），使「蝴蝶夫人」不流入於普通的「艷情片」。</p>
<p>男女主角是我們熟稔的陳燕燕與劉瓊，他們曾數度合作，如果以「洞房花燭夜」作為保證，「蝴蝶夫人」或許使人更留下深刻的印象。</p>
<p>「蝴蝶夫人」的配音，也是可寳貴的收獲，這是中聯設立音樂科以來第一部工作。</p>
<p>大光明為了本片的獻映，特在當天起開放冷氣，附此報吿。</p>
<h3>「第二夢」印象</h3>
<p>— 薇君</p>
<p>假使對上海整個劇壇透視一下，那末上海藝術劇團的再度崛起，站在觀衆與劇運的立塲，我們表示快慰與興奮。</p>
<p>當「第二夢」上演的第一塲，由於一種渴望與抑止不住的心念，我作了座上客，我看到了這　羣誠正的戲劇工作者抹着汗下偉大與心血的結晶。</p>
<p>是事實，「第二夢」含有很深的哲理，但是非常透澈，劇作者用各個劇中人對現狀的不滿，與在夢中給予滿足以後還是無法消遺自己的苦悶，來說明環境祗能影響人，而無法轉移人，假使自己能對當前的現實努力，那末戰勝環境，絕非難能之事。</p>
<p>「荒島英雄」的上演，曾經給予上海觀衆以新鮮的感覺，「第二夢」第二幕如意林中的舞蹈，是與荒島英雄情調有所不同而是更進步了的，我覺得這一次Seroff能對演員於舞時指示表情，是非常得體的，因為由於中國的演員不熟悉舞技，往往一心一意注視舞蹈，　是一個初學者無法避免的缺陷，這一次尸經糾正而且非常有意義。</p>
<p>全劇故事也許是因為缺乏統一性，所以演出上使觀衆玩味的地方更多，尤其是第二幕中的台詞，每一句都有深瀚的意義。喜劇是劇中的情節人物際遇，逗人發笑，而具有針砭的力量，搬演一些富有意義的喜劇，實在是有益的事。</p>
<p>導演對於全劇情調處理得很優美，演員也大致能夠平均發展，喬奇能演戲，對於動作唸詞的誇張，符合了喜劇表演的原則，丁芝演喜劇與悲劇並不感到有什麼髙下了，其他路珊，宋紅，梅眞，沈浩，江山，孫企英，鴻　，曹春，沙莉，都有很優秀的成績，至少是下了很大的功。</p>
<p>在我印象中，「第二夢」是値得一看的喜劇。</p>
<h3>記小徐三擋</h3>
<p>— 健帆</p>
<p>普餘　男女擋彈詞家初來滬時，以徐三擋最負盛名。雪月玲瓏嬌小，冰雪聰明；說噱彈唱，俱臻上乘。尤擅　書中角色，　不傳神阿堵，雖離滬已久，迄猶膾炙人口焉，雪行雪人兄妹輔佐雪月，如牡丹綠葉，相得益彰！自雪月脫離，雪　遣嫁後，雪行復於前歲，携　女弟子雪樓雪花來滬奏藝。雪樓綺年玉貌，書藝純熟；雪花珠喉婉轉，擅唱兪調，徐三擋之口碑仍佳。迺者，雪行又令其幼女及二小女弟子，合組一擋，同隸南京書塲，日夜登台，奏唱三笑與描金鳳二彈詞。聲淸雛鳳，居然一鳴驚人！愛略述此小徐三擋之藝如下</p>
<p>徐雪梅　雪梅年纔十四，從雪行習藝，猶不足三載；而有說書天才，悟性極佳！偶而登台「挿邊花」，歌對白開篇，聲音笑貌，與夫眼風手勢，酷肖雪月當年。自正式登台說書，以擅去書中生旦，唱念饒有崑味，頗為聽客激賞。苟再深加琢磨，前途正未可限量也。</p>
<p>徐雪蘭　雪行之幼女雪蘭，尙在髫齡。登台獻技，巳能充任上手，說表頭頭是道，一絲不亂。尤善「放噱頭」，足令聽者絕倒。嗓音甚闊，去凈角大氣磅礴，聲若洪鐘。狀付丑滑稽突梯，語頗冷雋，亦一奇才也。</p>
<p>徐雪芳　雪芳與雪梅年相若，貌頗秀麗，從師習藝，亦僅三戰。天賦佳嗓，高唱入雲；去書中旦角，婉　可喜。操三絃圓轉自如，熟極而流！以女彈詞家為中角之「無花果電影，嘗邀其串演劇中主角之幼年，操琵琶練習彈唱。雖初上銀幕，而態度自然，成續彌佳！潛心書藝，頗知刻苦自勵，有厚望焉。</p>
<h3>英國的影片</h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>英國攝製宣傳影片，主　機關有二：一個是情報局，另一個是屬於財政部的評議會。</p>
<p>情報局所　的宣傳影片，第一期是二白部，內中一百部是一卷短片，其他是兩卷或三卷的短片。</p>
<p>為了物價的不住高漲，近來攝製的成本，在不斷的加高中，到去年底，平均拍攝一部在五分鐘內可映畢的短片，所費成本，每呎計一英鎊，合美金五元。</p>
<p>第一期所攝的宜傳影片，大約有六十部到七十部，照預期目標，這些影片，公映以後，成本可取回的。</p>
<p>除英語外，用七　言語為對白，就是非洲語，荷蘭語，法語，葡萄牙語，巴西葡語，西班牙語，和哥侖比亞西語。目的在南北美公映。取材方面，有的含有商業性意味，有的非戲院性，也有</p>
<p>其他關於宜傳英國文化者有「英國的建築術」，「救生艇牛津號」，「運動第一」，「蘋果的故事，「競技勝利」諸片，但有人批評，在作戰時把這種影片拿到南北美去公映，是亳無價値的。</p>
<p>情報局和評議會雖各為攝製宣傳影片而努力，　彼此各自為政，同牀異夢，時常會互相攻擊的、這便是英國電影官傳的特點。</p>
<p>遊藝雜話</p>
<h3>𪢖來寶</h3>
<p>— 澤夫</p>
<p>來寳（北人稱急快念唱日　）。亦稱說來實，舊　善人知，其性質與蓮花落相同，原為乞丐討錢時所唱一種歌曲，惟其　雜耍塲中，亦往往有唱之者。唱時手持兩塊大牛骨，上拴銅鈴，柄上目拴幾縷彩布。唱一段後，即打牛骨一下，成瓜搭瓜搭之聲：此外亦有持竹板者，　與蓮花落同。所唱隨便雜綴，多是常塲即景，如京城胡同名」，　雜級北京胡同名稱而成，並無故事可言。大抵每句七言，開加襯字，句多有韻，以便歌唱。此種歌曲，咸同時巳盛行之。以其詞句諧謔，唱時父口若懸河，故頗為大衆所歡迎。都門竹枝詞所謂「近日人情總好奇，新聞謅出解人頣；羣　聚如蜂擁，圍着狂呼一乞兒」者是也。又此輩賣唱者，亦有供奉，其祖師為明太祖朱元璋，則不知何　：　者太祖出身　賤，初時亦如彼輩行市求乞歟？</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（六）一彈指</p>
<p>陳老太太是個瘦削的臉，臉上架一副老花眼鏡，上衣下裙，保持了古老風氣。維城對她深深的一鞠躬，說道：一太伯母，一向倒是沒有來請安，今天來的冒味得很。「陳老太太」邊對維城端詳，一邊笑道：「葉少爺是我們器官芳官的同學，他們兄妹倆；到葉府上告擾過，他們早就想請葉少爺到這裹來的。維城連說不敢當，坐下來一看，屋子裏的陳設，也不見得富　，也不見帶着雜亂的意味。一個方桌子上，陳列木魚經卷，還有一個小小的佛龕，老媽子忙着捧過一玻璃杯濃茶，面上浮起了幾粒焦麥。維城問道：「太伯母，國器他們沒回來嗎？陳老太太道：「前幾天有信回來，說兩三天裏準到，我倒是望了兩天了。他們信裏就提到葉少爺，說已經寫信上花港；約你到這裏來。我說這些孩子，都是沒腦子的，約了人，怎麼可以失信？」維城道：　這倒是沒關係。反正我來到道裏：一來好久不見了他們兄妹；二來也早存心要來拜候太伯母請安。一陳老太太道：「都像葉少爺這般懂得道理，就好了。他們沒了娘，又在外念書，念的都染上了洋氣，還有我，是太疼他們了，所以說的話都可以不算，不像葉少爺樣的，說一是一，說二是二。」、</p>
<p>陳老太太看見維城額上在冒汗珠子，要老媽子去找一把扇子來。老媽子想拍蚊子的葵扇，是不能敬客的，一找，就在國芳房裏，找了一把絹面的團扇來。維城接在手裹一看，是畫着一個美人，這美人的臉，雖然是古典美人，却和國芳有一些像。心裏在想，我一團高興來找國芳，見着這團扇上的美人，就算是見着國芳了嗎？不免有些惘然；把團扇搖着，笑道：「大概國器兄兄妹，一定在上海臨時有了另外一件事；不然，他們是不會不來省視老祖母的　。」　（一一九）</p>

The gist of his speech was: "I have repeatedly published essays in the Harijan newspaper, repeatedly requesting the withdrawal of British troops so that India would be spared the scourge of war, but I have not seen them implement it. We are deeply afraid that India will inevitably be affected by the scourge of war. I have repeatedly shouted that the Indian people do not want war to occur in India.

The Preparatory Committee has specially established eleven groups, including general affairs, publicity, and work groups. The agenda and activities of the conference have been decided. Furthermore, Chairman Wang of the Rural Pacification Committee sent a telegram with the following instructions: First, the purpose of rural pacification is to establish a model of local peace, and even more so to promote overall peace. We should always remember the people in the rural pacification areas, and even more so the people outside the rural pacification areas. Second, before December 8 of last year, the most important purpose of rural pacification was to promote overall peace. After December 8, the most important purpose was to assist in the Greater East Asia War. We should always remember to awaken the people and not be satisfied with merely living in peace and working in contentment. On one hand, we should develop the power of production in agriculture, industry, and commerce as much as possible. On the other hand, we should contribute our strength to the Greater East Asia War. This is how we seek the liberation of East Asia, and also how we seek the liberation of China itself. Third, since the purpose of rural pacification is so significant, we should pledge our loyalty and faith and contribute everything to achieve our goals and complete our mission. Fourth, we should know that rural pacification work is closest to the people. We should always remember the people's suffering, listen to the words in their hearts, and unite through affection and lead through assistance. This is the key to organization and training. Fifth, we should know that rural pacification work relies on the enthusiastic assistance of friendly army soldiers. We should always remember to maintain an honest and courageous personality, a humble and self-respecting attitude, and to be sincere and trustworthy from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Third-day dispatch from Nanjing of the Central News Agency: The Rural Pacification Committee will begin the first phase of rural pacification work in the southeastern area of Taihu Lake starting on July 1, which is scheduled to last for three months.

The above areas will be directly administered by the Rural Pacification Committee, and统辖 under the command of Li Shiqun.</p>
<h3>Result of British Vote of Confidence: Government Wins; Churchill Acknowledges Serious Situation in North African War in House of Commons Speech</h3>
<p>Second-day dispatch from Lisbon of the Allied News Agency: According to a London dispatch, the second day of the British House of Commons debate on the war situation was marked by a speech from Prime Minister Churchill in the afternoon. After debating the war failures, the House voted on a motion of no confidence in the cabinet proposed by MP Millan. The motion was defeated by a vote of 475 to 25. Churchill's cabinet has temporarily escaped the crisis.</p>
<p>Second-day dispatch from Stockholm, Sweden of the Allied News Agency: The result of the vote of confidence held in the British House of Commons was a victory for the government. Observers are paying close attention to how this result will affect the heads of the British government and military. Depending on the outcome of this vote, it is possible that the Churchill cabinet and military leadership may not be reorganized, but this depends entirely on the future development of the Egyptian front.</p>
<p>Washington The Contents of the Verdict are Kept Secret</p>
<p>Second-day dispatch from London of the Havas News Agency: The British House of Commons continued to debate the Libyan war today. Prime Minister Churchill personally delivered a speech to the House, stating that he was surprised when he heard the news of the fall of Tobruk and the criticisms of him by members of the House while he was in the United States. Churchill stated briefly, "On the morning of Sunday, June 19, I went to President Roosevelt's office and knew that the President had received the news of the fall of Tobruk. The impression was very deep. At first, I found this news difficult to believe, and I was greatly disappointed. In the following days, I read the newspapers and learned of the impression that this matter had caused domestically. I felt even more unhappy. One newspaper published this news with the headline 'The House of Commons Demands Churchill's Return Home.' I went to the United States this time to hold important meetings to discuss various issues related to the current war, but in the course of negotiations, tense air was repeatedly created in our country, which was inappropriate. Fortunately, although the environment was extremely difficult, it actually promoted my personal friendship with President Roosevelt. I have complete trust in the British people, and even in these tragic days, I discovered that the people still have the courage that can be trusted. I told the Americans that the person who speaks the most in the House of Commons does not represent the opinion of the House of Commons. I held talks with President Roosevelt and discussed the deployment of troops, ships, and aircraft, and studied what measures to take to reduce losses at sea. Most of the decisions made by President Roosevelt and I should be kept secret, so I am unable to announce them publicly."</p>
<p>The War Situation Changes Rapidly and Unexpectedly</p>
<p>Regarding the war in Egypt, the most serious war is currently taking place in Egypt. The situation is critical. We have suffered setbacks in the past two weeks, so the war situation in Egypt has also completely changed. Not only is this the case in North Africa, but also in the Mediterranean. Our troops have lost 50,000 men, most of whom were captured by the enemy. Although our army destroyed military equipment according to plan, a large amount still fell into the hands of the enemy. Currently, reinforcements have arrived in Egypt, and the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, under the command of General Freyberg, is also participating in the fighting. General Jia has repeatedly been wounded while leading the charge, which is admirable. However, the war is not yet over. It is difficult to estimate at this time to what extent this matter will have a negative impact on Turkey, Spain, France, and its colonies. In short, we have suffered setbacks in the Middle East. If anyone wants to describe our situation even more darkly at this time, I cannot stop them. One of the most painful points in the current situation is how quickly these unfortunate events have occurred. The fall of Tobruk in 24 hours was not only beyond the expectations of the General Staff, but also unexpected by General Auchinleck, the Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in the Middle East. Before this fortress fell, General Auchinleck, Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East, had telegraphed that he had stationed heavy troops in Tobruk, and the defenses were extremely solid, and there were sufficient supplies of food and ammunition for 90 days. Therefore, at that time, I found it difficult to judge whether our army could hold the port. Even at this moment, I cannot answer this question. The War Cabinet and technical advisors had agreed in advance to any measures taken by General Auchinleck. If he made a mistake, I am prepared to take responsibility for him. When I went abroad to the United States, I and the members of the Sub-Asia Department had the same feeling that the war in Libya had entered a stage of long-term warfare, no different from the war that occurred in that theater last autumn. Our resources should be greater than the enemy's, but it was impossible to prevent the Axis powers from sending reinforcements to Benghazi. At that time, we had a total of 100,000 men, while the Axis forces had 90,000 men. We had more tanks than the enemy, in a ratio of seven to five. In terms of artillery, it was also eight to five. Our air force also had an advantage. Therefore, at that time, we had complete confidence that General Auchinleck's forces could launch an offensive as soon as the weather improved. Unexpectedly, the enemy took the initiative and took the lead."</p>
<p>Fierce Verbal Battles in the British House of Commons</p>
<p>Third-day dispatch from Lisbon of the Allied News Agency: According to a dispatch from London, the intensity of the war debate held in the British House of Commons was unprecedented in the history of the British Parliament. The first day of the debate (the first day) opened at 2:45 PM, with 22 speakers. The verbal battle lasted for 16 hours and was not completed until the morning of the second day. After a brief rest, the speakers began to speak again, with the main points as follows: MP Bevan stated that Prime Minister Churchill is often the victor in every parliamentary debate, but is often defeated in war. Therefore, Prime Minister Churchill is the one with the most erroneous ideas about the concept of war and harbors wishful thinking. This fact can be proved by the insufficient number of dive bombers and transport planes, improper operational guidance, and poor production of weapons. Therefore, only by launching a second front this year can the British army have any hope of turning defeat into victory. MP Beria stated that we have fallen into a major crisis, which was beyond the government's expectations. The government believes that the seriousness of the situation can silence critics, but does the cabinet itself remain safe if the number of MPs voting against it is smaller? If we underestimate the enemy's strength, our own troops will inevitably be defeated by the enemy. We are waging war to maintain the only legacy in history, our naval power. However, if the reports that German forces have broken through the defenses of the Port of Al are true, then Churchill's boastful talk of the excellent equipment of the British army in Libya will collapse on its own. If Britain had been able to operate like Japan in the past, with close cooperation between the navy and air force, it would not have lost the "Prince of Wales" and the destroyer, and it could have ensured Britain's position in the Mediterranean. We believe that before the government can deal with the situation, it should prepare to take some measures. I am more concerned about the future of the British Empire than I am about the fate of the cabinet. We have lost East Asia in a hundred days, and what will we lose in the next hundred days?</p>

<h3>Germany Denies Refusing to Guarantee the Safety of Repatriation Ship</h3>
<p>Second-day dispatch from Berlin of the Havas News Agency: Regarding the Swedish ship "Gripsholm," which shuttles between belligerent countries to transport repatriated citizens, the US side falsely claimed that the German government had refused to guarantee its safety. Officials of the Foreign Ministry here issued a statement denouncing this as a fabrication and declared that the German government only requested that the ship should sail from the Portuguese capital of Lisbon to a port in the Gulf of Mexico designated by the US side, and not to New York. That is all.</p>
<h3>US Navy Builds Base in Northern Ireland</h3>
<p>Third-day dispatch from Stockholm, Sweden of the Haitong News Agency: ""Aftonbladet" published a report from a London correspondent stating that the United States is currently secretly building a naval base in Londonderry, Northern Ireland, which is only 60 miles from the Irish border. Hundreds of people enter and exit the area every day. The people of London are all comforted by this. In fact, there is a public telephone office there, only a stone's throw from the base, from which one can see the ships entering and leaving. Therefore, the US newspapers believe that keeping the matter secret is futile. The German naval authorities may have already learned the details of the area. It is heard that the construction cost of the base is as high as several million dollars. All the construction materials were transported to the area before December of last year.</p>
<h3>Germany Claims to Be Prepared on the European Continent</h3>

This is the first official statement from Germany. Goebbels strongly stated that the British and Americans may not be so naive as to think that Germany is not on guard against the European coast. We are prepared in all rear areas and would be happy to hear that British troops have landed in Europe, as the result will be even more devastating than the defeat at Dunkirk. As for inciting resistance from the people in the occupied areas, even if it succeeds, it can easily be quelled in a few hours, he said.</p>

<h3>Disorder in the Argentine Congress</h3>
<p>Third-day dispatch from Buenos Aires of the Havas News Agency: Today's Congressional discussion of the investigation into secret activities in Argentina caused a great uproar. The commotion was caused when the chairman of the investigating committee, Taborda, accused a section of Conservative Party members of being accomplices in Axis activities, causing them to become enraged. One of them threw a teacup at Taborda, but missed. The teacup grazed the head of a certain member of Congress. Although the speaker tried to stop the violence, heated debates continued in the Congressional break room. Afterwards, Taborda announced his resignation, but he was retained by a vote of the entire House.</p>
<p>Third-day dispatch from Buenos Aires of the Havas News Agency: Regarding whether the national state of siege should be lifted, the Senate voted 16 to 6 in favor of continuing it for 60 days, while the House of Representatives voted 64 to 52 in favor of lifting it. According to the Argentine Constitution, the case must be returned to the Senate for reconsideration. It is expected that the Senate will not change its original decision. If the House of Representatives wants to insist that what it passed is valid, it must obtain a two-thirds majority. However, since this majority is hopeless, what the Senate passed should be implemented.</p>

<h3>Tank Battle Unfolds Southeast of El Alamein, Egypt; Axis Forces Only Sixty Miles from Alexandria; Fresh British Troops Reinforce and Begin Counteroffensive</h3>
<p>Allied News Agency, Bear City, 3rd: According to news from Xianluo, German forces east of El Alamein in Egypt launched an attack approximately sixty miles west of Alexandria. British forces, reinforced by fresh troops transferred from Syria, are putting up a determined resistance. A Cairo communique today stated that British forces have begun a counteroffensive against General Rommel's troops, and the German advance has slowed. Some reports indicate that the sound of heavy artillery fire has been heard in Alexandria, suggesting intensified fighting. According to Cairo, the current battle line extends south from the El Alamein area for ten miles to the saline ground of Qattara. Yesterday, Axis forces engaged with tanks and motorized infantry. The Axis forces attacking south concentrated their attacks in front of British positions.</p>
<p>Allied News Agency, Berlin, 2nd: The German-Italian allied forces, having captured El Alamein, fiercely attacked the British Eighth Army and its reinforcements defending Alexandria and Cairo throughout the day. Frontline reports indicate that the Axis forces have breached the British defense line southeast of El Alamein, which stretches to the northern coast of the Mediterranean Sea. German heavy and light tank divisions are currently rushing towards their objectives. The British and American air forces are heavily bombing Axis frontline strongholds and rear supply lines in the El Alamein area to impede the Axis advance. The goals of this Axis operation are widely believed to be Cairo, the port of Alexandria, or Tanta, a crucial railway hub between the two cities. The fall of Alexandria is imminent.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Rome, 3rd: The Italian Supreme Command announced today that Axis forces are operating favorably southeast of El Alamein in Egypt.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Sking, 3rd: It is learned here that Xianluo announced last night that a "major battle" between Axis and British forces had begun in the area west of Alexandria since noon yesterday and is still raging.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Swedish Capital, 3rd: According to news from London, British forces in North Africa have begun a counteroffensive, spearheaded by New Zealand troops, while simultaneously attacking the flanks of German and Italian forces from the south. London Radio stated that British and American aircraft are encountering extremely heavy attacks. According to exchanged telegrams from Cairo, defenses in the Nile Delta are being intensified. Roads leading to the front are extremely congested with troops, tanks, and artillery. The first wave of reinforcements is reported to have reached the front.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Cairo, 3rd: The British Middle East Command announced this morning that enemy forces launched an offensive yesterday from the west against our El Alamein positions. Our armored and mobile units immediately counterattacked the enemy flanks, inflicting heavy casualties. A major tank battle ensued, lasting until late at night, when the enemy forces were forced to retreat westward. Our positions remained firm. In this engagement, a large number of our bombers and fighter aircraft joined forces to attack enemy concentrations southwest of El Alamein. Last night, British aircraft also attacked Tobruk harbor, while medium bombers focused on bombing enemy rear lines.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Rome, 2nd: Newspapers today published commentaries generally stating that the British forces in the Egyptian campaign are destined to fail. The main idea is that the German-Italian allied forces in North Africa are advancing eastward along three routes: the first along the coast, the second southward directly towards Cairo, and the third approaching southern Egypt. The Axis supply network is not yet fully organized, but there is ample supply of currency, fuel, and drinking water. Drinking water is drawn from Tobruk harbor and tributaries of the Marsa Matruh River. Fuel is taken from abandoned British oil depots. However, food supplies for the troops are difficult. Fortunately, the soldiers are highly motivated and have been fighting for more than six weeks in the harshest climate without showing fatigue. There are no fortified areas between the current Axis positions and Alexandria. The future of the war will likely be decided in the El Alamein area, where remnants of the British Eighth Army and some units of the Ninth Army are concentrated. A fierce battle is currently underway. This battle is not only crucial to the fate of Egypt, but also to the fate of the Caucasus, Palestine, Syria, Iraq, and Iran. The road to the Mosul oil fields passes through Suez. Once Suez is occupied, the Mediterranean will be controlled by Italy, and the lifeline of the British Empire will be severed. This would be an unprecedented catastrophe in British history.</p>
<p>British Reinforcements Arriving at the Front, Hope for the War is Not Yet Lost</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Somewhere on the Egyptian Border, 2nd: According to news from Cairo, British and Axis mechanized units are currently engaged in battle near El Alamein. According to the latest news from Cairo, the situation on the front has improved slightly, as the Axis forces have not yet been able to penetrate the British defense line extending from the Qattara Depression to the coast. In the near future, the Eighth Army may still be able to launch a counteroffensive. It is reported that the British defense line is very long, and British reserve units are stationed at important locations from El Alamein to Cairo and Alexandria. Generals Rommel and perhaps have the possibility of attacking from the south, the British have acknowledged this possibility, but believe that the Axis forces may be exhausted and unable to carry out such a flanking maneuver. According to news from El Alamein, the battle there began with artillery fire, followed by infantry and mechanized units engaging in combat. The German 90th Division broke through a gap in the southern British defense line, but the British launched a counteroffensive soon after, and the German forces were forced to retreat to their original positions. As of now, neither side has achieved a decisive victory. The fact that the British have been able to achieve this result after repeated defeats in recent days gives the British hope for the future, and reinforcements will arrive soon. Fresh troops from South Africa and New Zealand will be dispatched to the front lines to reinforce them within days.</p>
<p>Refugees Congest Tanta, Alexandria Again Subjected to Air Raids</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Ankara, 3rd: In addition to regular passenger trains, special trains were added yesterday between Alexandria and Tanta (approximately seventy miles southeast of Alexandria) to evacuate the large number of refugees from Alexandria. The situation for refugees in Tanta is extremely difficult. Due to the lack of refugee shelters, most refugees are sleeping on the streets. Moreover, there is also a food panic in Tanta. Shops have stopped operating to avoid selling out their stock completely within a few hours, so the situation there is very chaotic. At the same time, Cairo has banned refugees from entering. The roads between Alexandria and Tanta are congested with refugees, rendering them impassable.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Turkish Capital, 3rd: According to news from Cairo, residents have been evacuated from the Ras El Bar resort near Alexandria, and it has been declared a restricted area.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Ankara, 3rd: British sources report that a small squadron of Axis aircraft bombed Haifa, causing several casualties.</p>
<p>Allied News Agency, Argentine Capital, 2nd: The American side believes that Rommel's forces breaking into Alexandria is not only about the loss of that port, but also that the fate of the Suez Canal should be given considerable consideration. Plans are currently being made to destroy the canal. According to an Associated Press report from London on the 1st, British officials stated that if British forces are forced to retreat to the Red Sea or beyond, the Suez Canal will not be allowed to continue operating.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Cairo, 2nd: According to a recent announcement by the Ministry of Interior, Alexandria was again bombed by enemy aircraft last night. The damage was minimal, with only eight civilians injured.</p>
<p>The Evolution of the Egyptian War Affects the Safety of the Near East</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Swedish Capital, 2nd: The "Geneva Daily" recently published a dispatch from its London correspondent stating that, according to the general impression in Britain, decisive events will occur this week. Recent German communiques no longer mention General Rommel's troops. There is reason to believe that a large number of troops have been withdrawn from important battlefields and transported southeast in preparation for an advance on Cairo and the Nile Delta. Currently, the main forces of the Axis powers are continuing to push towards Alexandria and the Nile Delta. The British forces are expected to offer determined resistance between the coast and the Qattara Depression. There is deep anxiety about this, and the public is anticipating an official announcement of the fall of Alexandria. As for the approximately seventy British ships in the port, they will likely escape to the port of Beirut in Syria. According to some sources, British warships have already left the port and are sailing to the ports of Haifa and Said, although this has not yet been confirmed. In addition, the Egyptian war is enough to influence Turkey's attitude. This is well understood in London. There is also speculation about the impact that British losses will have on Spain and the Arab Muslim countries. According to "National News," Britain can rely on Outer Mongolia and Saudi Arabia. The reason why Saudi Arabia previously fought a war with Yemen was to prevent the increasing Italian influence in southern Arabia. Therefore, King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia should still support Britain. However, there may be some difficulties in Palestine. Axis propaganda promoting the Greater Arab cause has been quite successful, and the Jewish question has caused various difficulties for Britain and its allies. It is difficult to predict what will happen in Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon. Everything will depend on how the situation of British forces in the Near East evolves. Only a portion of the Ninth and Tenth Armies have been transferred to Egypt as reinforcements, as a large army must still be stationed in Syria and Lebanon for suppression. As for Turkey's attitude, it will also be determined by the iron law of military necessity.</p>
<h3>German-Italian Joint Declaration Respects Egyptian Sovereignty, British and Egyptian Officials Held Talks in Cairo Yesterday to Discuss How to Handle the Alexandria Issue</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 3rd: The German and Italian governments issued a solemn declaration guaranteeing respect for the independence and sovereignty of Egypt. The declaration states that the German and Italian governments declare that as German and Italian troops achieve victory in Egypt, the Axis powers solemnly guarantee to respect the independence and sovereignty of Egypt. The purpose of Axis troops entering Egypt is not to regard Egypt as an enemy country, but to drive the British out of Egypt and continue to wage war against Britain in order to liberate the Near East and free it from British rule. The Axis policy is based on the principle of "Egypt for the Egyptians," to completely free Egypt from British shackles and make it an independent and autonomous nation.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 3rd: A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry stated this afternoon that the German and Italian guarantee to respect the independence and sovereignty of Egypt is an epoch-making event for the Near East. The Axis powers made this decision because the German and Italian people not only have no ill feelings towards the Egyptian people, but also hope for Egypt's freedom and autonomy. This is completely different from Britain, which seeks to oppress the Egyptian people's lives and destroy Egypt's economic institutions for its own benefit. The Axis powers, on the other hand, aim to liberate the Egyptian people. German and Italian soldiers who are liberating the Near East and the Egyptian people are entering the Near East and Egypt to expel the British rulers. The history of the new Egypt will begin with freedom, national self-esteem, and participation in the new European order.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Swiss Capital, 3rd: The "Basel News" reported this morning in a special dispatch from Berlin that it is widely rumored in Berlin that the Alexandria area is within the range of German field artillery in North Africa and has been bombarded. It can be seen that the vanguard of the Axis forces has occupied half of the land between El Alamein and Alexandria. At the same time, according to a dispatch from the Turkish capital carried by the same newspaper, Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas, Alexandria Military Governor, and the British Ambassador to Egypt held talks in Cairo to discuss the issue of automatically destroying the port of Alexandria. The Egyptian government strongly urged the British authorities to abandon this plan. Since yesterday, the Egyptian government has revoked the privileges of foreign envoys to send messages or dispatch personnel, with the exception of Switzerland.</p>
<h3>Center of Eastern Front Warfare Concentrated in the Kursk Area, German Forces Launch New Offensive in Central Sector, Moscow Front Again Under Pressure</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Swedish Capital, 2nd: Neutral observers recently stated that after the fall of Sevastopol, the Eastern Front entered a new phase. The center of the war is now concentrated in the Kursk area. Since the German forces launched a so-called "offensive" in the area on the 28th of last month, the latest news indicates that the German forces have sent powerful units to participate in the fighting on that line. A large-scale tank battle is currently underway. The German forces are apparently targeting the city of Voronezh, which has a dual strategic importance. First, if the German forces occupy the city, the Moscow garrison will be isolated from the Southern Front Red Army. Second, the German High Command can freely decide whether to concentrate its troops northwards to encircle Moscow, or attack the rear of the Donets Basin Red Army from two directions. If the German forces do outflank the Donets Red Army, it will greatly facilitate the advance into the Caucasus. At the same time, it is heard that German forces have launched a fierce offensive in the Qiasike area, one hundred miles west of Moscow. This is the first time since last autumn that the Moscow front has been under pressure. It is expected that the German forces in the central sector will make a comeback and launch a new offensive against Moscow. The fighting on the Kharkov line is relatively quiet. German forces launched an offensive in the area on the 22nd of last month and captured Izium two days later. Since then, the fighting has come to a standstill and will likely not resume until the end of the cleanup battle in Sevastopol.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Berlin, 3rd: The German High Command announced today that German forces and their allies on the southern sector of the Eastern Front have broken through enemy lines to a width of one hundred and sixty miles. As of yesterday, over 50,000 prisoners were taken on both sides of Sevastopol.</p>
<h3>British and American Advising Nationals Residing in Turkey to Evacuate; Iraqi Railway Transport Busy</h3>
<p>Allied News Agency, Berlin, 2nd: The German Embassy, for the sake of taking precautions, stated in a dispatch from the News Agency in Ankara, that British and American special envoys residing in Turkey have issued advice to their respective nationals, ordering them to evacuate as soon as possible via Syria and Iraq.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Istanbul, 2nd: It has recently been learned that in recent days, 80% of all trains within Iraq have been requisitioned for the sole purpose of transporting troops and military equipment. The Taurus Express departing from the city of Iraq was delayed for a long time before arriving here, due to the busy Iraqi railway transport. According to passengers, they saw large numbers of troops heading to Syria, Transjordan, and Cairo. It has also been heard that additional trains have been added between Cairo and Alexandria to facilitate the evacuation of residents of Alexandria.</p>
<h3>South African Federation Enlists Workers</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 2nd: A message from Johannesburg, South Africa, states that the South African Federation is enlisting a majority of miners.</p>
<h3>Ten - The Kingdom of the Desert (3)</h3>
<p>The Full Picture of Saudi Arabia - The Two Holy Cities</p>
<p>Let us return to the west. We seem to have forgotten an important historical fact. We all know that Saudi Arabia is the birthplace of Islam and the ancestral home of Muslims worldwide, but we have not yet mentioned its two historically significant holy cities - Mecca and Medina. So let us talk about them now!</p>
<p>Mecca's name is Mlecca, but it can also be written as Mecqne or Mekke. It is located within the territory of the Hejaz, 100 kilometers east of the Red Sea, at an elevation of 400 meters, surrounded by the Djebon-Kobeis mountains in the east. The entire city is built with stones along the foothills of these mountains. As early as the Roman Empire, the Mecca region was already a prosperous commercial port. Ptolemy's geographical account mentions the name Makoraba, where the main trade at the time was spices. Before the founding of Islam, Mecca was ruled by the Koreischites tribe and was a gathering place for mass religions. Later, after the birth of Muhammad and the founding of Islam, this place was regarded as a holy land. After Al-Madje became archbishop, in order to accommodate the large number of pilgrims, he started the construction of a huge mosque, with roofs in the shape of domes and seven minarets erected around them. The mosque is magnificently built, to the greatest possible degree of splendor. Inside the Caaba, a black gem is placed, and pilgrims from all over the world, wearing Ir'harn made of woven fabric, wrap it around their waists. According to Islamic etiquette, they must first circle the Caaba seven times, which is called Fouaf, and then run back and forth between the Sufa Gate and Merowa seven times (Sai). In addition, a faithful Muslim must also pray on Mount Arafat for an entire afternoon and make sacrifices in Maura, because Muhammad suffered there. The etiquette of Islam is exceptionally complex, and like other religions, many of these rituals naturally have countless moving stories and historical facts, and are not entirely meaningless.</p>
<p>Before the Great War, the total number of Muslims who made the pilgrimage to Mecca each year was no less than 300,000. In the eyes of a Muslim, if they make a pilgrimage to Mecca once in their lifetime, it is like completing a perfect deed. If they are unable to visit the holy city, it is truly the greatest regret of their lives, fearing that even their souls will be restless after death. Take China, for example, in the past, a considerable number of Muslims from Qinghai and Xinjiang went there every year, mostly traveling by sea and landing at Jeddah, while those traveling by land mostly passed through India.</p>
<p>The normal population of Mecca is about 60,000, and half of the people's occupations depend on the pilgrims. They run hotels, teahouses, serve as guides, and run small businesses. Mecca's prosperity completely relies on passing visitors. In recent years, due to the war, the number of pilgrims has sharply decreased, and Mecca's prosperity has therefore plummeted.</p>
<p>People who live in Mecca for a long time develop skilled commercial techniques. They manufacture exquisite gold and silver inlaid ware, and every year, pilgrims buy some to keep as souvenirs. Large-scale commerce is almost entirely controlled by Indians.</p>
<p>From the Middle Ages onwards, Mecca has been under the rule of foreign races. Initially, it belonged to the Abbasids, in 1269 to Egypt, in 1517 to Turkey, in 1803 to the Wahhabis, in 1817 to the Ottoman Empire, and finally in 1924, it was occupied by the Wahhabis again. But regardless of continuous foreign rule, in fact, because of its special religious position, it is not closely related to politics. The actual ruler is the Grand Mufti, who possesses all privileges. In addition to Mecca, the Islamic holy land also includes Medina, also known as Ek Medina or Medinte-en-Nebi, where Muhammad's tomb is located. Medina is built on the Arabian Plateau, with water and grass nearby. From here, there is a railway to K拉克. In 622 AD, Muhammad fled to this place, and that year was designated as the beginning of the Islamic calendar. (Hegire) The mosque in Medina has been rebuilt many times. It was destroyed by fire in 1257. The current mosque was built by Egyptian King Khaid-bey in 1487. Medina, in addition to being where Muhammad preached during his lifetime, is also the burial place of the female disciple Dnan Abou-Bekr, so it has always been regarded as a holy land. Pilgrims who go to Mecca for pilgrimage never miss the opportunity to spend a few days here.</p>
<p>In Saudi Arabia, all cultural standards are built on the doctrines of Islam. We naturally do not deny that the doctrines of the religion have great educational significance in some aspects, but for many years, due to the restrictions of its strict religious rules, the progress of culture has inevitably been hindered. The spread of Islam relies on military force as a backing, so it was able to spread throughout Arabia in a very short period of time. Except for the stubborn Asir people who did not accept it until the beginning of the eighteenth century, the rest were infected by this religion in the seventh and eighth centuries. The Arabs were a nation with high intelligence and advanced culture in ancient times, but because they were bound by Islam, they have not been able to develop. Today, they still remain on the edge of semi-civilization. Recently, the rulers have also risen up to imitate the way Turkey, Iran, and other countries have handled Islam, and are working to improve it. We think that in the near future, its lost excellent civilization will be able to spread far overseas again.</p>

<h3>Silver and Money Businesses Reject Pledges of Daily Necessities to Curb Speculation and Profiteering by Non-Industry Members, Requests for Commodity Pledges Will Not Be Accepted; Businessmen Pledging Daily Necessities Must State Reasons</h3>
<p>For the purpose of assisting the authorities in stopping speculation and hoarding, suppressing prices, and ensuring the livelihood of the people, the member businesses of the Temporary Joint Committee of Silver and Money Businesses have decided to raise deposit and loan interest rates from the second half of the year, strictly handle mortgage loans and credit loans, and refuse requests for loans from non-industry members and those outside the industry, as well as pledges of daily necessities. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Strict Review of Pledged Items</p>
<p>The various businesses, recognizing that the buying and selling of goods by non-industry members and the hoarding of goods by those outside the industry are absolutely prohibited by law, will strictly handle the granting of loans against commodity pledges. Requests for commodity pledges from non-industry members and those outside the industry will be rejected. However, for businessmen who are definitely in the industry and not dealing in daily necessities, accommodation may be made. The business or factory requesting the loan must have valid proof. For daily necessities, such as soap, matches, grains, cotton yarn, cloth, and western medicine, if a pledge is requested, reasons must be stated before acceptance is considered. Strict regulations will be imposed on the loan period, and extensions will not be granted after the term expires, with strict orders for redemption.</p>
<p>Credit Loans Must Have Guarantees</p>
<p>Money businesses handle credit loans with a focus on four bottoms, that is, long-term loans of six months. The interest rate for overdrafts is calculated monthly based on the prevailing interest rate for deposits and overdrafts agreed upon by the Money Business Association each month. For example, if the overdraft interest for June is 28 yuan, the monthly overdraft interest rate is 2.8%. These credit loans must have reliable guarantors. According to the "Credit Loan Application Form" stipulated by the Association, each business must obtain and fill out the form and sign a contract. However, the term, interest rate, and loan amount may be determined by each business itself. Only legitimate factories, companies, and businesses are eligible, and loans will absolutely not be granted to individuals. Emphasis will be placed on factories manufacturing domestic goods and companies and businesses selling domestic goods, with the aim of supporting the production, transportation, and sales of domestic goods.</p>
<p>Raising Interest Rates to Be Handled Individually</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of raising deposit and loan interest rates for each business, the Money Business Association, the Bank Joint Reserve, and the Money Business Reserve have repeatedly discussed and passed the principle of raising interest rates. However, as it concerns the business of each business, it has been decided that each business will handle it individually, taking into account market and actual conditions. Loan interest rates will not be uniform, but generally, mortgage loans will be approximately 2% to 2.5% per month, long-term credit loans will be approximately 2.5% per month, and overdrafts will be approximately 3% per month. Deposit interest rates for current accounts will be from 0.1% to 0.5%, and for term deposits, they will be from 0.6% to 1%, calculated annually. However, for current account deposits, whether withdrawals are made with a passbook or by check, no interest will be paid if they are made before the end of the half-year settlement period.</p>
<h3>Issuance of Citizen Certificates in Northern Suzhou Creek Begins</h3>
<p>The municipal government is issuing citizen certificates, and all residents within the city limits can apply for them from the respective authorities. The Public Concession began issuing them in batches at the beginning of last month. The survey for the issuance of citizen certificates to residents north of Suzhou Creek by the Baojia Corps Office of the Japanese Naval Garrison Area has also been completed. A portion was initially distributed on the 26th of last month. By noon on the 30th, over 100,000 citizen certificates had been issued. More than 500,000 certificates will continue to be issued to applicants, and it is expected that the matter will be completed by the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Company Gift Certificates Still Permitted for Issuance; Different in Nature from Vouchers</h3>
<p>The Information Office of the Public Works Department announced that the Bureau had issued Notice No. 5970 on June 27, prohibiting the issuance of vouchers after the 11th of this month. The aforementioned notice does not apply to various gift certificates issued by department stores or similar establishments. This is because gift certificates are voluntarily purchased by customers as gifts for relatives and friends, and can be exchanged for goods of equal value. They are not compulsory in nature and differ from vouchers.</p>
<h3>Mr. Guan Zhi's Death at His Shanghai Residence</h3>
<p>Mr. Guan Jiongzhi, a respected elder of this city, had a reputation for morality and achievement that resonated throughout the country. In recent years, he devoted himself to Buddhist charitable endeavors, accumulating overwork that led to illness. Unfortunately, he passed away at his Shanghai residence on the 3rd of this month at the age of sixty-four. The funeral is scheduled for 4:00 PM on the 5th at the Central Funeral Home. All who heard the news, whether acquainted with him or not, deeply mourned his passing.</p>
<h3>Notice Regarding Deadline for Opening Safe Deposit Boxes at Chase Bank</h3>
<p>Chase Bank in this city has issued a notice to its safe deposit box holders, requesting them to personally open their boxes before the 20th of this month. Overdue boxes will be opened by the bank on their behalf.</p>
<h3>Shops in Western District Fined and Ordered to Close Cannot Substitute Fines; Another Twenty-Seven Businesses Ordered to Close</h3>
<p>Following the announcement by the authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession on the 2nd of this month that sixty-eight shops had been penalized for raising prices, Chief of the Western District Police Station, Pan Da, stated yesterday morning that another twenty-seven shops in the Western District had been ordered to close for violating the notices of the Price Control Committee. Substitutions of fines are not permitted. Seven shops were closed on the 1st, and twenty shops were closed on the 2nd. The period of closure ranges from one to nine days. To date, two hundred and twenty-nine shops have been penalized, and the deterrent effect is becoming apparent.</p>
<h3>Rice Shops Have Already Picked Up All Allotted Rice Yesterday; Those Without Housing Tickets Who Have Not Received Rice Purchase Certificates Can Fill Out Application Forms Within the Next Week</h3>
<p>The two concessions have set July 6th (yesterday was mistakenly printed as July 4th) as the date for implementing rationing by population. The 659 rice shops that signed retail contracts with the Public Works Department's Rice Management Department have been picking up white rice and broken rice from the warehouses in recent days. Methods have also been established for households without rent tickets to obtain rice purchase certificates. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>All Allotted Rice Picked Up Yesterday</p>
<p>According to inquiries by the Datong News Agency reporter, a total of 659 rice shops, 415 in the Public Concession and 244 in the French Concession, began picking up allotted rice from the Taikoo Warehouse on the Bund of the French Concession and the Zhejiang Xingye Warehouse on North Suzhou Road on July 1st. The total amount of white rice and broken rice combined was approximately 40,000 bags. Over 20,000 bags were picked up on the 1st, and over 10,000 bags were picked up on the 2nd. All rice was picked up yesterday.</p>
<p>Procedure for Rationing with Tickets is Flexible</p>
<p>After the rice shops have picked up the rice, they will begin distributing allotted rice with rice tickets at 8:00 AM on the 6th of this month. One person can purchase rice on behalf of multiple people with one ticket, so there are no restrictions. Residents can avoid the misery of crowding, and rice shops can respond calmly. The first set of rice tickets can be used to purchase rice from the 6th to the 11th, a period of six days, which is very flexible.</p>
<p>Complaints Flood in from Those Who Have Not Received Rice Tickets</p>
<p>The Public Works Department's Rice Management Committee has received many complaints in recent days from second landlords who have not obtained rice tickets for their tenants. For example, Kong Qinghua, who lives in the Securities Building on Jiujiang Road, has a family of six and has not received a rice ticket. The committee will not allow this to happen, so it is conducting an investigation to ensure that every person can obtain a rice purchase certificate.</p>
<p>Methods Established for Those Without Rent Tickets</p>
<p>For those without rent tickets to present, such as doormen of alleyways or buildings, tax-exempt churches, some schools and hospitals, and monks in temples, the Rice Management Committee has prepared an application form. From July 6th to the 11th, these forms will be available for collection. The Baojia chief only needs to provide certification, and the rice purchase certificate issuing office will issue the certificate accordingly to avoid anyone being left out. Therefore, those in the above circumstances can appeal to the office.</p>
<p>Applications for Food Household Rice Handled as Before</p>
<p>Applications for the allocation of food household rice for factories, hospitals, and schools can still be made to the Rice Management Office. Food households cannot receive allotted rice. The Rice Management Office and rice shops must first obtain an empty burlap bag transfer application form before issuing rice to the warehouse. Only after filling it out can they pick up the food rice.</p>
<p>Broken Corn to Continue to be Sold Today and Tomorrow</p>
<p>Finally, according to inquiries by the Datong News Agency reporter, the sale of broken corn by various rice shops yesterday was not enthusiastic, resulting in many leftovers. The rice shops consulted with the Rice Management Committee, and it was agreed that sales could continue today (Saturday) and tomorrow (Sunday). After the implementation of rationing by population, the amount of rice stipulated is not large, and it will be necessary to eat mixed grains in the future. Therefore, the supply of broken corn cannot be regarded as trivial. The Public Works Department has also stated that after the 5th, it will no longer retail broken corn.</p>
<p>Flour Applications Will Not Stop</p>
<p>For the second week (July 13th to 18th), in addition to stipulating that 1.5 liters of white rice be issued with the second set of rice purchase certificates, the price of the accompanying flour is also being considered. Whether the price of 1.5 liters of white rice will change in the second week is also pending a decision by the Rice Management Committee before it can be announced. After the implementation of rationing by population, the Public Works Department's Controlled Flour Office will not stop allocating flour to various flour product merchants. Applications can be made as usual to benefit the people's food supply.</p>
<h3>Labor-Management Agreement in the Hotel Industry Successfully Mediated by the Special Higher Police Department</h3>
<p>Most of the hotels in this city are located in the central district of the Public Concession. The industry's employees, in order to improve their treatment, jointly made demands to the capital, as follows:</p>
<p>Calling for Mediation</p>
<p>According to inquiries by the Datong News Agency reporter, the labor-management dispute has already been mediated by the Special Higher Police Department of the Public Works Department, which convened representatives of the capital, Pan Shiliang, Yan Boying, Dai Buxiang, Xu Shixun, Zhang Zaiting, Chen Huitang, Xu Tongxiang, Li Jiemei, Xu Wenzhao, Yan Rongqing, Chen Songtao, Yao Songnian, and representatives of labor, Xu Zhihe, Shen Fei, Ren Shengquan, Zhang Jun, and Ding Baocheng. Both parties signed six articles of agreement and the issue has been resolved.</p>
<p>Six Articles of Agreement</p>
<p>The contents of the agreement are recorded below: 1. Regarding meal subsidies, those who originally provided meals or subsidies will maintain the status quo. Those who do not provide them or provide subsidies less than the amount specified below will pay the specified amount. For first-class hotels, each employee will receive 40 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates (CRC) per month for meal subsidies, 30 yuan in CRC for second-class hotels, and 24 yuan in CRC for third-class hotels. 2. Those who originally provided tea leaves, soap, matches, and toilet paper will continue to do so. Those who originally provided subsidies will increase them by 20%. For those who do not provide them, the capital will subsidize each room with 2 yuan in CRC per month for first-class hotels, 1.5 yuan in CRC for second-class hotels, and 1 yuan in CRC for third-class hotels. 3. Each hotel will maintain the existing small account, but the capital shall not divide the portion of external rewards. 4. Employees shall not be dismissed without reason, except when there is factual evidence. Immediate dismissal shall occur if one of the following is committed: 1. Extorting small accounts or neglecting duties; 2. Not complying with store regulations, not following instructions, and treating customers with rudeness; 3. Engaging in embezzlement and corruption; 4. Engaging in bad habits; 5. Receiving criminal penalties. 5. The supply of lodging numbers will remain as is, but if the labor side provides their own, the capital will subsidize 50%. 6. When a hotel is sold, employees must be given priority for employment if recommended by the former owner and agreed to by the new owner.</p>
<h3>Wooden-Wheeled Rickshaws Appear in the Nanshi Area</h3>
<p>Due to the interruption of the supply of rubber products in this city, prices have soared, especially for rickshaw tire rubber, which is in a state of demand exceeding supply. Therefore, some rickshaw operators have recently planned to convert their wheels to wooden ones, with old rubber tires applied to the outer edge to remedy the situation. Such vehicles have been found in the Nanshi area, but the rattling sound when driving is disturbing.</p>
<h3>Return Travel Permits to Resume Issuance on the 6th</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of this month, the Public Concession Public Works Department has not issued temporary travel permits, and the issuance of return travel permits has also been suspended due to unfinished preparations. It is now known that the Public Works Department's permit issuing office and various district sub-offices will resume operations on Monday (the 6th).</p>

<h3>Central and Farmers Banks Offer Initial Withdrawals Yesterday; Farmers Bank Has More Customers Making Withdrawals; Withdrawals Above 5,000 Yuan Require Proof</h3>
<p>After investigation by the Shanghai branches of the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks, it was decided that the China and Communications Banks would be allowed to reorganize and resume operations, while the Central and China Farmers Banks would be entrusted to the Zhengjin Bank to liquidate the Central Bank, and the Taiwan Bank to liquidate the Farmers Bank. At the same time, in the interest of the depositors of the two banks, the first withdrawal payments began yesterday, with each household receiving 1,000 yuan in CRC (equivalent to 2,000 yuan in old currency). Yesterday, there were more withdrawals from the Farmers Bank, mostly current deposits, while there were fewer commercial deposits from the Central Bank, as past deposits were mostly from fellow banks, so there were fewer withdrawals. The withdrawal methods announced by the two banks are recorded below:</p>
<p>Central Bank</p>
<p>The Central Bank at 702 Jing'an Temple Road announced the following first payment method: The bank will begin paying deposits on July 3rd, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM (excluding Sundays and holidays). The following first payment method is hereby stipulated: 1. Current deposits of 1,000 yuan in CRC (equivalent to 2,000 yuan in old legal tender) or less can be paid out in one lump sum, but if a payment has been made after December 8th of last year, the amount already paid should be deducted. 2. For current deposits of 5,000 yuan in CRC (equivalent to 10,000 yuan in old legal tender) or more, if it is proven that there is no hostile relationship, payment can be made in accordance with item 1. 3. For fixed deposits, regardless of whether they have matured or not, the deposit slip must first be verified, and then transferred to a current deposit, and paid in accordance with items 1 and 2. 4. Deposits from fellow banks will be handled separately. 5. The second payment method will be announced separately.</p>
<p>Farmers Bank</p>
<p>The China Farmers Bank at 984 Avenue Edward VII announced the following first withdrawal method: "The first payment for all types of deposits at this bank will begin on July 3, 1942. Depositors are requested to come and withdraw their funds in accordance with the methods outlined below: 1. The withdrawal limit for the first payment is 1,000 yuan in CRC per household (including the amount already withdrawn from December 8th of last year to May 27th of this year). 2. Payment time is from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM. 3. Depositors with 5,000 yuan (converted to CRC) or more must have proof of non-hostile status. 4. The date of the second payment will be announced separately."</p>
<p>Citibank</p>
<p>At the same time, Citibank, a U.S. bank, which is also being liquidated, continued to process the fourth withdrawal yesterday. The withdrawal percentage is 14% of the remaining balance after the first withdrawal, totaling 90%. The number of withdrawals has decreased compared to before, as most people have already withdrawn their remaining deposits.</p>
<h3>Death of Mrs. Qu, Zhou; Remains to be Encoffined Today</h3>
<p>Mrs. Zhou, the wife of our newspaper's reporter, Mr. Qu Pengnian, suddenly contracted an epidemic disease and passed away yesterday morning after unsuccessful treatment. The remains have been moved to the Dahua Funeral Home at 800 Rue Cardinal Fesch and will be encoffined today. Colleagues of this newspaper and friends of Mr. Qu deeply regret the tragic news, remembering Mrs. Qu's thrift, diligence in managing the household, and amiable conduct in the world. They have been going to pay their respects successively yesterday and today.</p>
<h3>New Teachers and Staff Establish Dacheng Middle School</h3>
<p>A portion of the former teachers and staff of the Xin Jian Middle School in this city recently established the private Dacheng Middle School at No. 146 Hart Road, the original site of the former Xin Jian Second Division. They will continue the past school management policy of strict teaching and management. Important teachers in various high school and junior high school subjects, such as Qian Xiaomin, Zhuang Qianlie, Sheng Minzhen, Zhuang Yan, and others, will continue to teach or hold positions at the school. The school also aims to alleviate the economic burden on students' families due to the rising cost of living in Shanghai. The tuition and miscellaneous fees for high school and junior high school have been reduced to the lowest possible level, and many scholarships, free tuition, and half-tuition are available. The school has already begun enrollment. The first examination date is scheduled for the 15th of this month. Recently, the number of new students registering has been quite enthusiastic. It is said that the school has also established preferential transfer policies for former students who have studied at the Xin Jian Main Branch and the Qiuzhi Middle School. These transfer registration procedures have been scheduled to begin on the 6th of this month. Students from both schools can register at the school on Hart Road within the specified period with their credentials, and their grades will be compiled with their past academic records, which will remain fully valid.</p>
<h3>Guoyi Pingmin Hospital Sees a Surge in Patients During Summer; Urgently Seeking Financial Assistance from All Sectors</h3>
<p>The Guoyi Pingmin Hospital at 88 Rue Robert in Western Shanghai has been diligently treating poor people who come for medical treatment and has always been praised by all sectors. During this summer, the weather has been erratic, and the number of hospitalized patients has increased. The medical supplies, food, rice, and all other expenses required are enormous. The hospital is a charitable organization, and its expenses are entirely covered by donations from people of all sectors. It is hoped that more assistance will be provided so that the hospital can continue to operate. A designated donation office has been set up inside the Renji Hall on Yunnan Road.</p>
<h3>Opening of the "Exhibition of Historical Banknotes" Today</h3>
<p>The seven large characters "Exhibition of Historical Banknotes" are hung at the entrance of the YMCA at Baxianqiao. This novel and historically valuable exhibition will surely attract the attention of many people and officially opens today.</p>
<p>Mr. Guan's Collection is Rare in the World</p>
<p>Collecting banknotes is like collecting stamps, both are good hobbies and meaningful forms of entertainment. They both have historical and geographical value. There are now many people who have a passion for philately, but it is rare to hear of banknote collecting. This time, Mr. Guan Jiangmin of Dongting Mountain continues his ancestors' hobby of collecting banknotes and has collected more than 4,000 kinds of Chinese banknotes from past dynasties. Although it cannot be guaranteed that there are no omissions, this historical contribution is already commendable.</p>
<p>The currency system of China's past dynasties mostly used coins as the main body, and the issuance of banknotes was only an auxiliary nature, so they rarely circulated. Mr. Guan's collection includes general treasury notes from the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, as well as various local notes issued by various provinces and regions during the Republic of China, as well as military tickets, vouchers, etc., all of which are available.</p>
<p>Among the banknotes exhibited this time, the Tang Dynasty is the oldest, dating back 1,292 years. As for whether there were banknotes issued before the Tang Dynasty, that remains to be discovered by archaeologists. The most recent is the banknote issued by the Central Bank in 1941, which is less than a year old. The largest amount is 10,000 yuan, and the smallest amount is 1 cent.</p>
<p>Collection from Tang Dynasty Onward is Complete</p>
<p>Now, some of the precious historical banknotes are briefly recorded below for reference by visitors: Tang Dynasty: There is the Great Tang Treasury Note of One String, issued during the Yonghui period of the Tang Dynasty, worth 1,000 coins, which circulated for 33 years, dating back 1,292 years, and the Great Tang Convenient People's Treasury Note of One Hundred Strings, issued during the Tianyou period of the Tang Dynasty. At that time, very few of these large banknotes were put into circulation among the people and can be called rare treasures. Song Dynasty: There is the Great Song Circulating Treasury Note of One Hundred Strings, issued during the Jianlong period of the Song Dynasty, worth 100 coins, which circulated for a long time, dating back 982 years.</p>
<p>Yuan Dynasty: There is the Warehouse Sufficient Exchange Certificate of Fifty Taels of Stored Silver, issued during the Zhizheng period of Emperor Shun, worth 50 taels of silver, which could purchase hundreds of acres of good farmland at that time, dating back 588 years, at the time when Zhu Yuanzhang launched an uprising in Chuzhou (see picture), and the Great Yuan Military Salary Treasury Note, issued during the Zhiyuan period of Emperor Shizu of the Yuan Dynasty, worth 400 coins, dating back 671 years, at the time when Mongolia established the country. Ming Dynasty: There is the Great Ming Circulating Treasury Note, issued during the Hongwu period, dating back 574 years, and the Circulating Treasury Note issued by Zhu Yuanzhang when he established the capital in Yingtian.</p>
<p>Qing Dynasty: There is the Great Qing Circulating Treasury Note, issued during the Xianfeng Dynasty, dating back 81 years, and the general treasury note issued by the Yuning Official Silver Coin Bureau in the 31st year of Guangxu, dating back 37 years. Especially valuable is a type of rice ticket, which was issued by the Enfeng Granary after a natural disaster in the 17th year of Guangxu. Each person could receive 1.8 dou of rice per season, averaging 2 liters per day. This is also a precedent for rationing by population. Republic of China: The banknotes issued by various provinces and regions after the founding of the Republic are too numerous to mention, and many of them are precious. For example, the 50-yuan exchange coupon issued by the Guangdong Provincial Bank in 1918, and at the same time, there is another 50-yuan exchange coupon issued in 1914 on display together. At first glance, there is no difference between these two banknotes. The twists and turns behind them are left for visitors to ponder. Other items, such as military tickets issued during the Northern Expedition and banknotes used in the Northwest Mongolia and other border areas, are all collected.</p>
<p>The above is less than one-tenth of the collection. For those who study archaeology and those who pay attention to the changes in economics and finance, this opportunity to observe is also a great event.</p>

<h3>Xia Guifu, the Main Culprit in the Gun Murder of Wu Qilun, Was Hanged Yesterday; Cried Out in Injustice Before Execution, Saying He Was Fooled by Gu ××</h3>
<p>Xia Guifu, a notorious robber, is 32 years old this year and hails from Yancheng. He has no permanent occupation and has been imprisoned for theft. After being released, he did not repent but continued to collude with others to commit robbery and spend the money. On August 30, 1939, he and his gang robbed a Deda Qianzhuang money transport on Wuchang Road, making off with a massive</p>
<p>52,000 Yuan.</p>
<p>He escaped with the stolen goods and repeatedly robbed residents in the western Shanghai area, committing numerous crimes. Later, his accomplice, Zhao Kun, was arrested after a case. Xia then accompanied Wei Xiaohu, who had already been killed, to the home of lawyer Wu Qilun at No. 3, Lane 102, Tongfu Road, asking Wu to appear in court to defend Ding, but Wu refused, causing dissatisfaction among Xia and others. They also saw that the diamond ring Wu was wearing was very valuable, so on the morning of March 4, 1940, at 11:40 AM, Xia and others went directly into Wu's residence. Without asking any questions, they shot Wu</p>
<p>Three Times in a Row,</p>
<p>All hitting vital areas, killing him instantly. After the incident, Xia and others fled without taking the diamond ring. Xia was later arrested after the case, and after three trials, he was sentenced to death. At 10:00 AM yesterday, he was escorted to the execution ground at the Nanshi Detention Center for hanging. The criminal cried out in injustice, claiming that he was fooled by Gu ×× and that he had received 800 yuan, etc. However, things had already come to this point. He requested that Gu ×× be notified to collect his body after death. After the confession, he was immediately tied to the execution ground and executed according to law. In the afternoon, according to the criminal Xia's confession, a bailiff was assigned to notify Gu ××, but Gu's family said that Xia had a grudge against Gu and deliberately slandered him, so they refused to collect the body.</p>
<h3>Zhang Danping's Arrest; Detained on Avenue Foch on June 21st</h3>
<p>A Tongmengshe dispatch from this city reported yesterday that a sergeant of the Japanese Kenpeitai arrested Zhang Dan, the head of the Shanghai branch of the Blue Shirts Society, on Avenue Foch at 11:00 PM on June 21st. Zhang and his associates were involved in more than 20 cases of activity in Shanghai, including the assassination of Chuan Xiao'an on October 11th last year, and the assassination of Lieutenant Nomura, a military doctor, in December. Previously, the Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces, the Japanese Kenpeitai, and the Japanese Consulate Police had captured Wang Shixiong and 20 accomplices, learning of Zhang's activities, and increased their investigation, resulting in Zhang's arrest. After Wang Shixiong and others were arrested, Zhang left Shanghai for Chongqing and returned to Shanghai in January via Jinhua. Zhang graduated from Wuxi Third Normal School in 1937 and had worked as a teacher, long-distance bus station manager, and shipping company manager. In April 1939, he went to Hong Kong and joined the Blue Shirts Society, and was subsequently appointed as the head of the Shanghai Blue Shirts Society.</p>

<h3>Doctor Gao Wenbing Offers Free Clinic</h3>
<p>Dr. Gao Wenbing, a female doctor, graduated from Tongde Medical College and has served in the Red Cross General Hospital and other hospitals for many years. She recently established her own clinic at No. 28 Jing'an Villa, telephone number 37105, specializing in internal medicine and pediatrics, and has saved countless lives. It is now learned that in view of the fact that the poor and sick are unable to afford medical expenses at this time of high prices, resulting in starvation, which is not the way of human mutual assistance, she has, on the orders of her respected father, Dr. Gao, added a free clinic from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM every day, waiving consultation fees and only charging for the cost of medicine. All poor and sick people can seek medical treatment.</p>
<h3>Shenbao Readers' Scholarship Fund; All Sectors Save to Help Students; The Abrupt Increase in Tuition Fees at Various Schools Means that the Need is Urgent, and it is Hoped that Enthusiastic People in Society Will Continue to Donate</h3>
<p>The third session of the Shenbao Readers' Scholarship Fund is currently being organized. However, the tuition fees at various schools in this session have increased several times compared to the previous session. Therefore, the need for scholarship funds is even more urgent.

Yesterday, Mr. Zheng personally delivered a donation of CRC 1,000 in scholarship funds to our office, braving the summer heat. We are deeply impressed by his actions. At this difficult time, Mr. Zheng's implementation of frugality to accomplish a righteous deed is truly worthy of emulation by society. We deeply hope that all sectors will respond and make this practice of saving to help students a trend. Then Mr. Zheng's contribution will not be limited to generously pointing out large sums of money.</p>
<p>Ren and Yuan Celebrate Their Engagement by Helping Students</p>

<h3>Six Bottoms Passed, Cotton Cloth Sales Develop, Production Costs Increase, Prices Rise Gradually</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday, as the six bottoms have passed, the actual need for this street began to develop. Due to the relationship between production costs, goods have gradually risen. For example, 16-pound Earth coarse cloth is 190 yuan, Flying Goose is 185 yuan, 9-pound New Character is 117 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong is 112 yuan, 12-pound Earth fine cloth is 174 yuan, Dapeng is 170 yuan, Fugui is 171 yuan, Fugui fine twill is 155 yuan, Peach Blossom Lady Lin is 273 yuan, Magnolia bleached cloth is 171 yuan, Qin Liangyu is 163 yuan, Longevity Fuchou is 6 yuan 25 cents, Changting is 6 yuan 15 cents, Three Sheep Serge is 6 yuan 30 cents, Chick An'an blue cloth is 190 yuan, all have business opening.</p>

<h3>Public Bond Prices High, Triggering Bulls to Emerge, Market Prices Rise First Then Fall</h3>
<p>Public Compensation Gray Market: Yesterday, after the holiday, the market opened as usual. The initial opening price was very high, suddenly rising 1 yuan 57 cents compared to before the holiday. At this time of uncertainty, the opening price was inevitably too high, which then triggered bulls to emerge. There were also major players selling in the market, and the market situation gradually declined. For example, the initial opening price of Type C was 39 yuan 20 cents, and it hovered for a long time at the 9 yuan market. Tongli gradually sold, and there were also buyers at that time. Later, Yitai suddenly had a large number of sales, and the market situation was under double pressure and gradually felt unsustainable. After the 9 yuan mark was passed, it soon broke the 8 yuan mark. There was an initial rebound, but it was immediately frustrated. In addition, major players continued to release spot goods, and the market situation still could not improve.

A simplified table is listed below.</p>

<h3>Bran Sells Well, Factory Opens Less, Goods Scarce, Market Quiet</h3>
<p>Bran: Recently, because the factory has rarely opened, the market is quite popular due to the scarcity of goods. Yesterday, a Xiangzhuang assistant went to Sanxin to call for 100 bags of small bran, with the April 15th stack price at 93 yuan, and the May 26th stack price at 95 yuan 50 cents to 96 yuan.</p>
<h3>Soybean Sales, Market More Firm and Expensive</h3>
<p>The soybean market showed strength yesterday, mainly because the source was not smooth and the owners' intention to sell was firm. In particular, tea beans were selling well. More than 100 bags of Zhangjiakou Ganzhi beans were sold at a price of 248 yuan, 50 bags of inferior Wuhu soybeans at a price of 200 yuan, 30 bags of Chongming sand silkworms at a price of 111 yuan, and 20 bags of Minhang New Green silkworms at a price of 168 yuan including bags.</p>
<p>There is not much supply and demand for corn, and the market is still firm and expensive. One car of Wuhu corn was opened at a price of 125 yuan delivered.</p>
<p>Dried sweet potatoes are not lonely to sell, and the market is relatively stable. One hundred bags of Shandong dried sweet potatoes were opened at a price of 109 yuan delivered.</p>
<h3>Strict Pickiness in Using Banknotes</h3>
<p>There is a lot of pickiness in the market for the use of banknotes. Generally, banknotes with writing or stamps are not accepted. It is true that writing or stamping on banknotes is not appropriate. The origin of this habit may be due to deliberate scribbling and writing, but also due to the difficulty of inspection, which often leads to the occurrence of counterfeit banknotes. It is difficult to distinguish, and between receiving and giving, the giver must sign or stamp to be responsible, so that if counterfeit banknotes are found, they can be returned. It is not as good as shops and money changers clearly pointing out the banknotes on the spot, and not being responsible after leaving the counter. This kind of atmosphere has been in place since silver dollars, and has not been replaced. Now, most people who unknowingly receive banknotes with writing or private stamps are in the majority, especially since there are many original knife banknotes mixed in. If you inadvertently receive it, it is difficult to use it. Although the method of exchanging broken banknotes has "printed and scribbled text" in the list of non-exchangeable items, you must know that this loss is often not in the writer or stamper, but in the unintentional recipient. Therefore, it is believed that the "cleaning movement of banknotes" should be initiated, but before it is initiated, a relief method should be planned for the already stamped and written banknotes, and they should not be rejected across the board. The most convenient plan is to announce a period of time, and within that period, all of them will be collected and exchanged uniformly. After the deadline, any banknotes with scribbling and stamping will not be used.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the problem of the degree of damage. Recently, if the edges of banknotes are slightly torn, especially the ends of the center seam of folded banknotes, most of the banknotes that have been used a little more are split, or the crease is slightly deep, close to tearing, or the paper is soft and rotten, they are rejected. Banknote users feel very difficult. If you see such banknotes and ask the payer to adjust them everywhere, you will inevitably be scolded, thinking that such banknotes cannot be used. Where can I get so many new banknotes for you to use? If you accept it, it will be difficult to use in all shops, small vegetable fields, and public utilities, and it is difficult to reason. This kind of pain is hard to express in one word, and besides, the degree of breakage is actually less than one-fourth, so why is it so cruel to be picky about water donations?</p>
<p>Because those with more than one-half damage are not exchanged, the market does not use banknotes that are in two halves, even if everything is complete, which is too cruel. Even the natural holes that occur in the center seam after being used for a long time are not allowed to be used, which seems to make people feel lost in both material and spiritual terms.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we advise everyone not to abuse their pens, scribble, or stamp, and not to fold banknotes again after folding them, and the layers of creases are easy to break, or roll them into a bundle, or take them with wet hands (especially not after water), or stuff them into a bag. At most, they are folded in half. The best way is to lay them flat in their original state. If cotton wool can be sandwiched inside the crease, it will not be easy to break and it will be more beneficial.</p>
<h3>Soybean Cakes Sell Actively in Nearby Villages, Prices Are Expected to Rise by One Yuan</h3>
<p>Soybean cakes are gradually becoming more active in nearby villages, and confidence is quite good. Prices are expected to rise by one yuan. 500 pieces of Lizi brand new goods in May were opened at a price of 59 yuan, 500 pieces of Fengji brand new goods in April were opened at a price of 58 yuan, and 1,000 pieces of new goods in May were opened at a price of 58 yuan 50 cents to 59 yuan. 2,000 pieces of Shengji brand old goods in May were opened at a price of 51 yuan to 51 yuan 50 cents at the Guyu Stack, 55 yuan at the Yoshida Stack, 5 pieces of old goods in June at a price of 51 yuan, 500 pieces of new goods in April at a price of 58 yuan 50 cents, 500 pieces of new goods in May at a price of 59 yuan, and 500 pieces of new goods in June at a price of 58 yuan.</p>
<h3>Dried Scallops Are Scarce, Sales Market Is Expanding</h3>
<p>Dried scallops are not followed up with new arrivals, and the market inventory is even scarcer. Therefore, the market numbers are showing a continuation of tightness. Moreover, this product is regarded as a treasure in banquets, and the price is expanding due to the scarcity of goods. The sales market price for medium-sized dried scallops yesterday was 3,500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Stocks Are Looser</h3>
<p>The sugar stocks of the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office were still weak in trading at the guild yesterday, and the trend turned softer, showing a slight downward trend. The opening price of coarse sugar stocks was 320 yuan, a small three yuan, and then slightly rebounded to 321 yuan, still a small two yuan. The trading of red sugar stocks was even less, with only one transaction made at 309 yuan, a small two yuan and a half.</p>
<h3>Tangerine Cake Production Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Tangerine cakes have risen in production prices by 100 to 200 yuan, and inventories are currently lacking. Customers are afraid that they will not be able to meet the plan, and dare not purchase, so the source is interrupted. However, the northern road needs are currently very strong, and the inventory is already small, and demand is even stronger. The after-market can be expected to rise. Market prices are still rising.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Transactions Are Not Lonely, Market Prices Are Still Rising</h3>
<p>The cigarette market is still on the rise. The day before yesterday was a holiday for money changers to settle accounts, but transactions between colleagues were not lonely, and prices tended to rise. Yesterday's opening took over the momentum from the previous day, making the market still strong. Prices uniformly jumped higher than the six bottom lines. The opening prices were 8,800 yuan for Great Britain brand, 5,700 yuan for Old Knife brand, 4,700 yuan for Pinhai brand, 3,900 yuan for Fairy brand, and 3,700 yuan for Wuhua brand, rising by 400 to 500 yuan, and 100 to 200 yuan, respectively. Japanese cigarettes are also fashionable, with Jinguang brand at 1,450 yuan, Jindalu brand at 2,100 yuan, Red Rose brand at 1,775 yuan, Quanlu brand at 1,950 yuan, and Compass brand at 1,400 yuan. National cigarettes are Beautiful brand at 3,100 yuan, Gold Mouse brand at 1,600 yuan, and Pyramid brand at 2,950 yuan.</p>

<h3>Cancellation of Movie Synopsis</h3>
<p>— A Writer</p>
<p>—Contribution of a Remedial Method—</p>
<p>The July 1st newspaper reported a joint announcement from all Shanghai domestic film theaters stating: "Due to the shortage of white paper, our theaters have decided to temporarily cancel the synopsis of the story from July 1st. Fortunately, the plot of domestic films is very easy to understand. As it is a last resort, we hope that all audiences will understand." The signatories are sixteen theaters, including Greater Shanghai.</p>
<p>From this announcement, we can know that from now on, before watching a movie, we can no longer hold a synopsis to understand the outline of the plot, and at the same time, we cannot spend the boring wait for the screening.</p>
<p>I remember before the war, the synopses of first-run theaters had as many as three pages, and second-run theaters also had two pages. The photos and text were beautiful, and there were also lists of actors. Recently, they have gradually shrunk. The synopses of third-run theaters are only the size of pre-war movie tickets. Some people call them tofu squares, which is a fitting name. Now that there is no tofu square, I really feel nostalgic for the past.</p>
<p>Not having a synopsis is not entirely a bad thing. Like a detective drama or a horror drama, if you don't know the synopsis, the plot may grab your emotions more. If you already know the beginning and end of the plot, you might even laugh at the detective's effort to go in circles. In the end, there will be no twelve points of attention to the ups and downs of the plot. So many people watch movies and never look at the synopsis first, at most referring to it afterwards.</p>
<p>Now that the synopsis has been abolished, it is not much of an inconvenience for experienced viewers, but most viewers do not understand the changes in movies, such as when they see that what is being shown on the screen is a certain time, and then an actor says, "X years ago, at that time...", the screen suddenly changes to things from X years ago. The characters who were just buried alive are now alive and doing business, which really makes them feel confused. Therefore, the abolition of the synopsis is a great inconvenience for most viewers, and it may not be without loss to the theater business.</p>
<p>I propose a remedial method, which is to print the synopsis on the movie ticket, with small black letters on a white background (printed on both sides). The date and time can be printed on top in large letters in light red or light yellow. The end that is torn off should be as narrow as possible, with the name of the theater printed on it.</p>
<p>Among the synopses, simple and clear ones are rare. Most are rambling and rambling. From now on, we must reduce the number of words to the point where they cannot be reduced further, while not losing the essence. I wonder what everyone thinks?</p>
<h3>Another Opinion</h3>
<p>— Yun Zi</p>
<p>Regarding the temporary cancellation of movie synopses due to the shortage of white paper, I have a slight suggestion to offer to the cinemas to remedy the lack of synopses.</p>
<p>The task of a synopsis is to explain the general story of the movie, or to introduce the cast of actors playing the roles, and advertisements for the upcoming films. In general, viewers need a synopsis to help them understand the content of the movie. Now that the synopsis has been canceled due to the lack of white paper, it will inevitably hinder viewers with lower comprehension or those who do not understand Mandarin. Now I have come up with two methods to remedy this shortcoming.</p>
<p>First, in the corridor of the ticket office in the front of the cinema, etc., install advertisement cabinets for new film previews. The cinema can use it to make a public synopsis, and write the "List of Actors", "List of Staff" and "Story" on white paper and paste them in the cabinet. Then, viewers who have read the announcement in the cabinet will be better than having read a synopsis.</p>
<p>Second, after the "List of Actors" and "List of Staff" at the beginning of the film, slightly show some "Story Outlines", so that viewers can know the story told in the movie before it is shown, when and where it happened, etc.</p>
<h3>"Animated Synopsis"</h3>
<p>— Zhuan Yuan</p>
<p>Movie synopses are of great help to viewers in understanding the plot, because not all viewers in Shanghai understand Mandarin. Once the synopsis is abolished, wouldn't it make them even more "Shandong people eating winter wheat, completely ignorant"? If they don't understand the plot or the dialogue, it is naturally extremely inconvenient.</p>
<p>Now I see a suggestion in a small newspaper for an "animated synopsis": The so-called "animated synopsis" is that ten minutes before the start of the movie, a witty girl will tell the plot in Mandarin and Shanghainese like telling a story. This way, it can make up for the lack of a synopsis, and it is more interesting than viewers reading the synopsis themselves. I think it is indeed a good way worth introducing to domestic film theaters to adopt.</p>
<h3>About "Madame Butterfly"</h3>
<p>— Li Lei</p>
<p>Produced by Zhonglian and publicly screened at the Great Light Theater starting on the 9th</p>
<p>"Madame Butterfly" will be screened at the Great Light Theater starting on the 9th. This is the first film that Zhonglian has publicly screened since its establishment. The enthusiasm of the Shanghai audience for her is probably equal to Zhonglian's emphasis on this work.</p>
<p>After the adaptation, there are two points worth mentioning in "Madame Butterfly": The male protagonist is no longer a "heartless man", he, like Butterfly Girl, is also a prisoner in the hands of the feudal system. Everyone in it is a pitiful worm worthy of sympathy, which is enough to emphasize what Li Pingqian said in "or to 'Madame Butterfly'" - anti (anti-feudalism, anti-class, anti-large family), so that "Madame Butterfly" does not flow into an ordinary "love affair movie".</p>
<p>The male and female protagonists are our familiar Chen Yanyan and Liu Qiong, who have collaborated several times. If "Wedding Night" can be used as a guarantee, "Madame Butterfly" may leave an even deeper impression.</p>
<p>The dubbing of "Madame Butterfly" is also a valuable gain. This is the first work since Zhonglian established the music department.</p>
<p>The Great Light Theater will open air conditioning from that day for the screening of this film. This report is attached.</p>
<h3>Impressions of "Second Dream"</h3>
<p>— Wei Jun</p>
<p>If we take a look at the entire Shanghai theater scene, then the resurgence of the Shanghai Art Theater Company, from the perspective of the audience and the theater movement, we express our joy and excitement.</p>
<p>When "Second Dream" was staged for the first time, due to a kind of longing and an irresistible thought, I was a guest in the audience. I saw the crystallization of the sweat and hard work of this group of sincere theater workers.</p>
<p>It is a fact that "Second Dream" contains very deep philosophical ideas, but it is very clear. The playwright uses the dissatisfaction of each character with the status quo, and the inability to dispel their own depression even after being satisfied in their dreams, to illustrate that the environment can only influence people, but cannot change people. If they can work hard on the current reality, then overcoming the environment is by no means difficult.</p>
<p>The performance of "Hero of the Desert Island" once gave the Shanghai audience a fresh feeling. The dance in Ruyi Lin in the second act of "Second Dream" is different from the style of Hero of the Desert Island and is more advanced. I think that this time Seroff was able to instruct the actors on their expressions during the dance was very appropriate, because Chinese actors are not familiar with dance skills and often focus on the dance, which is an unavoidable defect for beginners. This time it has been corrected and it is very meaningful.</p>
<p>The story of the whole play may lack unity, so the audience has more to savor in the performance, especially the lines in the second act, each sentence has a deep meaning. Comedy is the plot, characters, and encounters in the play that make people laugh, and it has the power of satire. It is really beneficial to perform some meaningful comedies.</p>
<p>The director handled the overall mood of the play very well, and the actors were generally able to develop equally. Qiao Qi can act, and the exaggeration of movements and lines conforms to the principles of comedy performance. Ding Zhi doesn't feel any higher or lower when performing comedy and tragedy. Other Lu Shan, Song Hong, Mei Zhen, Shen Hao, Jiang Shan, Sun Qiying, Hong, Cao Chun, and Sha Li all had excellent results, at least they put in a lot of effort.</p>
<p>In my impression, "Second Dream" is a comedy worth seeing.</p>
<h3>Notes on Young Xu San Dang</h3>
<p>— Jian Fan</p>
<p>When the Puyu male and female dang bullet lyricists first came to Shanghai, Xu San Dang was the most famous. Xue Yueling was exquisite and petite, and quick-witted; her storytelling, jokes, and singing were all top-notch. She was especially good at playing the characters in the book. It was not that she was not expressive. Although she has been away from Shanghai for a long time, she is still well-known. Xue Xing and his sister and brother Xue Yue assisted Xue Yue, like green leaves setting off peony flowers, complementing each other! Since Xue Yue left and Xue was married off, Xue Xing returned to Shanghai two years ago with his female disciples Xue Lou and Xue Hua to perform. Xue Lou was beautiful and pure, and her storytelling was skilled; Xue Hua had a melodious voice and was good at singing Yu tunes. Xu San Dang's reputation is still good. Now, Xue Xing has ordered his youngest daughter and two young female disciples to form a dang together, all belonging to the Nanjing book market, performing on stage day and night, singing the bullet lyrics of Three Smiles and Describing the Golden Phoenix. The voices of the young phoenixes were surprisingly amazing! I would like to briefly describe the art of this young Xu San Dang as follows:</p>
<p>Xu Xuemei: Xuemei is only fourteen years old, and has been learning from Xue Xing for less than three years; but she has a storytelling talent and is very perceptive! Occasionally performing as a "side flower", singing, speaking dialogues, and opening chapters, her voice, smile, and eye movements are very similar to Xue Yue in her youth. Since officially performing as a storyteller, she is good at singing and reading the male and female roles in the book, and she has a Kun opera flavor, which is very appreciated by the listeners. If she delves deeper, her future is unlimited.</p>
<p>Xu Xuelan: Xuelan, the youngest daughter of Xue Xing, is still in her childhood. Performing on stage, she is already able to act as the first hand, telling the story in a clear and orderly manner, without any confusion. She is especially good at "making jokes", which makes the listeners laugh. Her voice is very broad, and she goes to Jing Jue with a majestic and loud voice. She is also a genius in her description of the ugly and funny, and her words are quite witty.</p>
<p>Xu Xuefang: Xuefang is about the same age as Xuemei and looks quite beautiful. She has been learning from her teacher for only three years. She has a gifted voice and sings high into the clouds. She is gentle and lovely in her performance of female roles in the book. She plays the three-stringed instrument smoothly and skillfully! As a "fig movie" for female bullet lyricists, she was once invited to play the childhood of the protagonist in the play, practicing playing the pipa and singing. Although it was her first time on the screen, her attitude was natural and her achievements were even better! Focusing on the art of storytelling, she knows how to work hard and is very hopeful.</p>
<h3>British Films</h3>
<p>— New Shadow</p>
<p>There are two main organizations in Britain responsible for producing promotional films: one is the Information Bureau, and the other is the Council, which belongs to the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>The Information Bureau's promotional films are released in two series. The first series consists of two hundred films, one hundred of which are short, single-reel films, and the rest are two- or three-reel short films.</p>
<p>Due to the continuous rise in prices, the cost of production has been constantly increasing. By the end of last year, the average cost of shooting a short film that could be screened within five minutes was one pound per foot, equivalent to five US dollars.</p>
<p>About sixty to seventy of the films produced in the first series are expected to recover their costs after public release, according to projections.</p>
<p>In addition to English, the dialogues are in seven languages, namely African languages, Dutch, French, Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, and Colombian Spanish, for public release in North and South America. In terms of subject matter, some films have commercial implications, some are non-theatrical, and some</p>
<p>Others that promote British culture include "British Architecture," "Lifeboat Oxford," "Sports First," "The Story of Apples," and "Athletic Victory." However, some criticize that it is worthless to take such films to North and South America for public release during wartime.</p>
<p>Although the Information Bureau and the Council are both working hard to produce promotional films, they are each doing their own thing, dreaming different dreams, and often attacking each other. This is the characteristic of British official film propaganda.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Notes on Entertainment</p>
<h3>Lai Bao</h3>
<p>— Zefu</p>
<p>Lai Bao (called "quick singing" by Northerners). Also known as "Shuo Lai Shi," known to kind people in the old days. Its nature is similar to the Lotus Drop. Originally, it was a kind of song sung by beggars to ask for money. However, in miscellaneous variety shows, there are also singers. When singing, they hold two large cow bones, with copper bells tied on them, and a few strands of colored cloth tied on the handle. After singing a section, they hit the cow bones once, making a "gua da gua da" sound. In addition, there are also those who hold bamboo clappers, which are the same as the Lotus Drop. The lyrics sung are casually pieced together, mostly impromptu scenes, such as "Names of Hutongs in the Capital," which is pieced together from the names of Beijing hutongs, and there is no story to tell. Generally, each sentence has seven characters, with opening interjections, and most sentences rhyme for easy singing. This kind of song was already popular during the Xianfeng and Tongzhi reigns. Because the lyrics are humorous and the singer is eloquent, it is quite popular among the public. The bamboo branch words of the capital say, "Recently, people's feelings are always curious, and new stories are made up to amuse people; crowds gather like bees, surrounding and shouting at a beggar," that's it. Moreover, these singers also have a patron saint, and their ancestor is Zhu Yuanzhang, the Ming Taizu, but it is not known why: is it because Taizu was born lowly and initially begged like them?</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat Through Wind and Rain</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(6) A Snap of Fingers</p>
<p>Old Mrs. Chen had a thin face, with a pair of old glasses on it. She wore a traditional upper garment and skirt, maintaining the old style. Wei Cheng gave her a deep bow and said, "Grand-Aunt, I haven't come to greet you for a long time, and I'm intruding today." "Old Mrs. Chen" looked Wei Cheng up and down, and smiled: "Young Master Ye is a classmate of our Guo Fang and Guo Qi. They have troubled you at the Ye residence, and they have long wanted to invite Young Master Ye here." Wei Cheng repeatedly said he didn't dare, and sat down to take a look. The furnishings in the room were not necessarily rich, nor did they carry a messy feel. On a square table, there were wooden fish and scriptures, as well as a small Buddhist shrine. The old nanny was busy bringing over a glass of strong tea, with a few pieces of burnt wheat floating on it. Wei Cheng asked: "Grand-Aunt, haven't Guo Qi and Guo Fang returned?" Old Mrs. Chen said: "A few days ago, a letter came back, saying that they would definitely arrive in two or three days. I've been waiting for them for two days. Their letter mentioned Young Master Ye, saying that they had already written to Flower Harbor, inviting you to come here. I said these children have no brains, how can they break their promise after inviting someone?" Wei Cheng said: "It doesn't matter. Anyway, I came here for two reasons: first, I haven't seen Guo Qi and Guo Fang for a long time; second, I had intended to come and pay my respects to Grand-Aunt." Old Mrs. Chen said: "It would be good if everyone understood reason like Young Master Ye. They lost their mother and are studying abroad, and their studies have been influenced by foreign styles. And I, I'm too fond of them, so what I say doesn't count. Unlike Young Master Ye, who means what he says."</p>
<p>Old Mrs. Chen saw that Wei Cheng's forehead was sweating, and asked the old nanny to find a fan. The palm-leaf fan for swatting mosquitoes was not suitable for guests. After searching, she found a silk fan in Guo Fang's room. Wei Cheng took it in his hand and saw that it was painted with a beauty. Although the beauty was a classical one, she looked somewhat like Guo Fang. He thought to himself, "I came happily to find Guo Fang, but seeing the beauty on this fan, is that considered seeing Guo Fang?" He couldn't help but feel a little lost. He waved the fan and smiled: "Perhaps Brother Guo Qi and Sister Guo Fang had another matter in Shanghai; otherwise, they would not fail to come and visit their old grandmother." (119)</p>
