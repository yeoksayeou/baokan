<h3 id="c33">蘇聯的石油 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>蘇聯現在是僅次於世界最大產油國之美國的世界第二產油國。它在一九三八年的產油量，是二萬零二百三十萬已雷耳，一九三九年的產油量是二萬一千六百五十萬巴雷耳，而在一九四〇年的產油量是二萬二千五百萬巴雷耳。一巴雷耳等於四十五加侖，假定七巴雷耳等於一公噸，那麼蘇聯在最近一年中的產量是三千萬公噸。這和年產一萬八千萬公噸佔全世界總產額之百分之六十一左右的世界最大產油國的美國比較起來雖然趕不上，可是和其他各國比較起來，已足以據第一把交椅了。</p>
<p>然而蘇聯的屈居世界第二產油國還不過是最近的事。從十九世紀的末葉迄至本世紀的初期，它一直以先進之美國爲對手，從事石油之爭覇戰，並目雖然爲時僅　數年之久，在進入本世紀的前後，蘇聯曾一度覇佔世界產油的第一位。自入本世紀以後，因美國石油業飛躍的發展，結果雙方的產量發生極大的差異；雖然如此蘇聯始終佔着第二把交椅。它的降落於第二位以下僅限於國內發生革命，石油業陷於停頓狀態的數年間吧了。</p>
<p>產油的中心地</p>
<p>那麼，這些大量的石油是在那裏生產的呢？目下蘇聯境內產油的油田，可大別爲以下各地：一高加索地方，烏拉爾地方，中亞細亞和遠東地方。其中高加索地方直到最近爲止，生產着蘇聯境內產額的百分之九十以上的石油，最近因其他各地的產油開始增加，所以共百分比已視前略减，可是依然保持着百分之八十八左右的紀錄，儼然形成蘇聯石油業的中心地。</p>
<p>設起高加索地方的油田，又可細別爲以下三個油田，即巴庫油田，葛羅斯尼油田和瑪克浦油田。</p>
<p>猶如蘇聯石油業的中心是高加索，高加索石油業的中心是巴庫油田。實際上蘇聯石油業是藉巴庫油田起家的。在本世紀的初期，巴庫油田的產額，佔着全部產額的百分之一百至百分之九十七，其後因新油田陸續被發見，其比例也逐漸减少，可是它的產量始終有增無减，至今日仍保持着蘇聯之中心油田的地位。</p>
<p>高加索的油田</p>
<p>在亞洲大陸的西北隅與歐洲接境的附近，橫着黑海·裹海和阿速夫海·形成複雜的地形。在黑海和裹海之間橫着廣大的地峽狀的陸地，接續着亞洲和歐洲的國境。這地峽狀的部分就是高加索地方。而在這區域的中央橫亘着一條大山脈，這就是那著名的高加索山脈，自西北斜向東南，長達七百五十哩。</p>
<p>這高加索山脈的周圍起伏着的丘陵地，自古以來是以富有石油的湧出地及瀝靑的堆積地等而聞名的。在這山脈東端部分的丘陵之一部，突出於裏海之中，形成叫做愛浦錫朗的小島。這小島上尤多石油的湧出地及瀝靑的堆積地。而這半島的南邊有着叫做巴庫的小港，因爲這裏事實上就是這半島的石油事業之中心的原故，半島的油田，也就被擺統地稱爲巴庫油田了。</p>
<p>巴庫油田是爲美國石油業之興隆所刺戟，於一八七五年時開始興起的。天賦變富的油層，使它頃刻間凌駕先進的美國。</p>
<p>繼巴庫油田之後，在高加索山脈的北麓相繼發見葛羅斯尼及瑪克浦油田。葛羅斯尼的產油之達到一百萬巴雷耳，始於一八九五年，達到一千萬巴雷耳始於一九一四年。至於瑪克浦油田倒達到一百萬巴雷耳還是一九二八年的事。可見這二個油田到近十餘年來才開始在高加索估據重要的地位。</p>
<p>葛羅斯尼油田位於山脈之北麓的東方，相近裹海，離海岸僅九十哩。反之，瑪克浦則在西方，離阿速夫海計達一百三十哩。兩油田間的距離約計三百哩。</p>
<p>石油業的使命</p>
<p>蘇聯石油的產額，到一九〇一年激升至八千叫萬巴雷耳。可是其後非但絲毫不見增加，反而在逐漸减退之中。這一方面是由於巴庫油田的渴枯，一方面是由於採油工人的屢次實行罷工。原來產油的激增引起油價的跌落，而油價的跌落，又間接促成工資的减低。工人因要求提高待遇，不時實行同盟罷工以爲要挾，結果使本已萎縮的巴庫石油業更形不振了。</p>
<p>然而至一九一八年發生了非將過去一切淸算不可的大事件，那就是紅軍的侵入巴庫區域。從一九一八年的散月至一九二〇年的五月，巴庫油田完全變成流血的戰塲，絕無將油的餘地了。因此該年的產油，也激减爲二千五百萬巴雷耳。</p>
<p>至一九二〇年五月二十八日，蘇維埃政府把幽內所有石油業收歸國有。當時被沒收的工塲，數達三百零九家；而其全部資本額爲九萬五千四百四十八萬盧布。</p>
<p>自從被收歸國有後，蘇聯石油業發展之速，是足以驚人的。石油的產量開始與年俱增。當然其主力乃是以巴庫爲中心的高加索地方的油田。倘使將其增加的產量用數字表示起來，大槪是這樣的：在一九二〇年僅達二千五百萬巴雷耳的產額，至一九二五年倍增爲五千二百萬巴雷耳，至一九二〇年激增爲一萬二千五百萬巴雷，而至一九三三年已經變成七，八倍於開始國營時的一萬八千二百寓巴雷耳。其中自從一九二八年至一九三二年的五年間，根據第一次五年計劃，從一九二八年的八千五百萬巴雷耳增爲一九三二年的一萬五千四百萬巴雷耳，平均每年增加一千四百萬巴雷耳。從一九三三年起開始第二次五年計劃，至一九二七年已增爲一萬九千五百萬巴雷耳，平均每年增加八百萬已雷耳。至於其後的產額已在本文的開瑞詳細介紹，不必再在這裏了嚕囌。</p>
<p>新發現得田油</p>
<p>上面設過蘇聯政府相繼實施五年計劃從事增翻石油的產量，同時它又發見了許多新的油田。這對於增加全國的總產量自然頗有裨益，可是顯示突飛猛進之發展的共中僅一處吧。那就是在烏拉爾地方發見的新油田。</p>
<p>烏拉爾地方屬於古生代的地層，誰也不以爲這裏令有石油的。可是在一九二八年於探索鉀礦的時候，鑽孔針竟觸到了石油的礦源。努力從事開發的結果，一九三五年採得二百九十萬巴雷耳，而於一九三九年已能採取一千三百六十萬巴雷耳了。</p>
<p>中亞細亞地方的油田可分成：　在裏海之東岸地方的愛姆巴油田及其他數個油田，　在土耳基斯坦的非爾格納油田</p>
<p>至於蘇聯在遠東的石油業，就是指在庫頁島北部的油田</p>
<p>中亞細亞及遠東各油田的產油，在一九三六年佔蘇聯全部產油的百分之二，八，至一九三七年增爲百分之一三，九，而至一九三八年已激增爲百分之六，四了。</p>
<p>其中庫頁島的產油，據可靠的估計，似在四百萬巴雷耳以上。此外在貝喀爾湖附近蘇聯當局會從事試掘石油，從最近的文獻看起來，似乎已能採取少量的石油。</p>
<p>以上所述，就是蘇聯石油資源的槪况。耍而言之，其中心依然是佔着國內產額之百分之九〇左右，年產二千二百萬公噸的巴庫油田。這油田和黑海的要港巴流由長五百六十哩的鐵路和數條輸油鐵管連繫着。它的通路是在高加索山脈南側的低地，極少可憑以防守的天險，巴統是巴庫石油的輸出地，在這裹有大規模的製油廠。蘇聯如一且失去黑海的制海權，巴庫將變成失去了嘴唇的牙齒了。</p>
<p>蘇聯產油區之巴庫Baku，其城市已臻近代化，圖為Gubanov街道之景。</p>

<p>除了這等靠着佣金過活的推銷員之外在街上又常常看到拉起了叫嗓子買的猶太販子。他們賣的大扺是肥皂，鞋帶和絨綫織物以及其他輕便的日用品等。他們操着生硬的中國話，看樣子挺可笑，但是他們求生的勇氣，却是可歌可泣的。</p>
<p>買進賣出　從中取佣</p>
<p>每天早晨，四川路南京路轉角近中央大厦的地方，集中了許多的猶太人。他們大多是掮客之類，揀這個交通便利的區域，做他們會集的市塲。差不多每個人都帶着一隻皮包，手中拿了一本小小的日記簿，寫這樣寫那樣的。那是小錢莊的中心區域，他們機敏地打聽行情，做着投機的買賣。很多人站在街口，點數大疊的鈔票。美金票，日軍票，儲備票和法幣等在他們手中盤來盤去，買進賣去。他們又是呢絨，藥品，紙烟等等雜物的掮客，顧客差不多就是他們自己圈內人，從中掮販，賺些佣金而已。</p>
<p>九十點鐘時，這批猶太商人成羣給隊的從虹口出來，穿過四川路橋，來到這臨時的市塲。每個人的服裝都是很挺刮的，活露出紳士派氣。一堆一堆的站在人行道邊。有的在高談闊論，有的在咬耳細語，有的一個人踱來踱去，有的靜悄悄地站在一角算賬。近傍兩個咖啡室，完全是他們的世界。女侍們殷勤地招待他們，夢想這等吝嗇的人，生意興隆，會一時高興，付出超過常額的錢來。</p>
<p>男女一律　爭取生存</p>
<p>從中央大厦轉到北京路外灘。每日中午，大枇的猶太女人湧進外灘公園。她們的工作較他人爲勞苦。她們到公園去，並不是爲了要逃避都市的煩囂，祇是要揀一個乾凈的地方，吃着帶來的麵包等物，充作簡單的午食。她們有的在盡椅上坐着，有的懶洋洋的躺在像絨毯般的草地上。她們亦像男子一樣，是推銷的能手，在公園中帶着旖旎的笑臉，招呼着人，希望人家買她們的東西。她們沒有美滿家庭的理想，亦不想做戀愛的酣夢，她們暫時拋棄了人生底美的價值，在這陌生的城市中掙扎，要獲得一個立脚的據點，幫助她們的丈夫或父兄，爭取生活的物質的需要。</p>

<p>— 哈台</p>
<p>跑馬廳的大自嗚鐘正指着九點，作爲都市中心的幾條馬路，又從睡夢中醒了過來。店舖裏的伙計一邊伸呵欠，一邊拉着鐵門，那些寄寓店舖門前的一堆堆的「動物」（！），都紛紛蠕動起來，裏着破蓆子或破蒲包向各處爬開了。從西向東的長蛇陣似的電車，包車黃包車和脚踏車，絡繹不絕地吐出各色各樣的摩登男女，——自然也有光頭的彪形大漢，「死樣活氣」的瘦子，以至長袍大褂或者是西裝畢挺的“Oldman”。不消說：這批可敬的仕女們，是上寫字間的，但他們去的所謂「寫字間」，我看至少有三分之一是一種名叫「銀號」或「紗號」的地方。</p>
<p>××紗號開幕纔不過幾天。門前還堆着小丘陵似的半萎的花籃；强烈的新鮮油漆氣味，直射入人們的鼻孔。這時候，小小的長方形屋干裏早已「濟濟一堂」了。有的圍坐在大餐桌周圍喝茶或吸烟；有的在那裏來回踱方步；有的獨坐在角落裏看小報；也有的在非常起勁地談論交易的形勢，例如「廠單有發還消息」，「今天可以翻多頭；之類，總之，大家都平心靜氣的期待着「開盤」。</p>
<p>屋子的右角是一條長櫃臺，上面安置着至少有十來架大小高低不一的電話機，櫃臺裏面掛着特大的劃有方格的黑板，六七個男女職員坐在裏面閒話。</p>
<p>九點三十分。</p>
<p>忽然，一個胖胖的頭髮精光的中年人，在櫃裏前面高站起來，拉起一隻常話筒大聲地喊着：</p>
<p>「喂，喂！雙馬開盤啥行情？」</p>
<p>一霎時，大家的目光都集中在他的身上了。</p>
<p>「啊，開盤六千九百元！」那個人響亮地喊着，就有一個學徒模樣的靑年在黑板上記下來。</p>
<p>「喂，九百—九百五十；九百五十—七千；七千零五十—一百！」一連串的聲嘶力竭的叫喊，左手揑着話筒，右手屈着手指，用力地作勢，那捲起的一大段雪白的襯衫袖口，因着手的動作，顯得格外漂亮動人。</p>
<p>全塲騷然了。「零五十買進十包！」「賣出三包」！「利記進三包」！的聲音混做了一團。兩個年靑的姑娘手不停筆地記着賬，額角上淌滿了汗珠。</p>
<p>「現在有人五十元賣出了—九百八十—七千；七十—八十；六十—七十；……八百—八百二十—」</p>
<p>又是一陣騷動，一陣「賣出十包」，「賣出五包」的聲音。這時侯，我揑着新開戶的憑摺在屋子裏打轉，不知道如何是好。</p>
<p>「看樣子，脚地軟下去了，我看可以拋空」。一個西裝靑年在對他的一位同伴說着。</p>
<p>我旣毫無主意，就聽了他的意見，悄悄地跑到櫃裏前面做了一包空頭。</p>
<p>果然，一下子從八百二十瀉到五百。我暗暗地歡喜，屈指一算，已賺了三百元光景。</p>
<p>中間是一陣上下不定的「盤旋」，那個聽電話的胖子聲音有些嘶啞了，嘴脣邊全是唾</p>
<p>『現在，市塲上謠言廠單有發還消息。七千一百—一百五十；一百五十—二百；二百—二百五十…………九千—九千一百！九千元我要！』那發狂似的叫喊，簡直令人有些慷慨激昂起來了。</p>
<p>啊：九千一百元！我肚裏一算，九千一百元减六千八百二十元，等於二千二百八十元，五百元證金己經完結啦！我有氣無力地拖着沉重的脚溜出了××紗號。</p>
<p>第二天早晨，郵差遞進一付掛號信來：</p>
<p>『哈台先生：</p>
<p>尊戶賣出變馬廠單一包計價六千八百二十元，但今日晨開盤價達九千五百元，敝號已代爲照章了結，除去證金五百元，尙欠二千一百八十元，仰希即爲理楚乃感！</p>

<p>衛丹博士神經系病學專家也最近發明一種特效劑專治一切神經系疾病及失常各症。</p>
<p>（腦衞）之主要製迭原料，以神經細胞中所含之來錫丁（Lecithine)及含鐵精之原質，故能對於交感大神經發生特效而起療治疾病之反應能力，有如衛丹博士所施行接觸鼻膜療術同等功效。雖然衛丹博士並非以「腦衞」便能代替其新療術之謂也。惟以此藥為一般路遠病家，不克親來就診，或因業務關係之病者，不能常常受接觸鼻膜療術治理，服用此藥而已。</p>
<p>「腦衞」能治療一切神經系失常及血液循環衰弱而致之症。凡患神經衰弱，服用「腦衛」最為神效。神經過敏之患者，往往無因而致憂鬱，每覺悲觀而自苦，服用「腦衛」後，立能恢復自信心而將愁慘思想摒諸腦外。若體重减輕，身體孱弱，服之，亦見奇效云。</p>
<p>衞丹博士所發明之「腦衞」旣能强壯各器官，故亦能醫治痼性支管及肺部咳嗽疾病及氣喘。至於生殖性能喪失之患者亦能恢復春靑。蓋因春靑之興奮，賴乎腺的分泌及交感大神經之健康與其神經潛力之發動。若於最初發覺性衰陽萎等病，立即服用「腦衛」最能挽回而恢復原有健康，蓋此藥含有大量增進器官之活力，而補腺之不足也。凡用「腦衛」者均感其有返老還實之功。</p>
<p>「腦衛」更有鎮定神經之功，深能治療失眠而恢復其睡眠也。</p>
<p>凡有兒童身心發育遲緩，或懶惰成癖，或神經癎發等症，服用「腦衛」亦殊奏效。</p>
<p>「腦衞」因有促進血液循環之偉大能力，故治月經不調及經期疼痛，功效立見。</p>
<p>「腦衛」　成丸狀，每日三餐前服用一粒。十歲至十七歲兒童减半。</p>
<p>「腦衛」在下列各大藥房及衞丹化學製藥廠（靜安寺路八六八號一〇一號房，電話三六一九五號）均有出售。茲將主要代銷處列后</p>

<p>吃飯胡足談，談亦奚益；但今日之下，羅米吃飯，固為社會上之唯一談料；况茲之所談，祗談吃飯，不談民食，料亦無妨。</p>
<p>胡樸安先生前年患腦充血，得半身不遂症；當其在病中，會往訪之，此老畢竟不凡，倚書作枕，讀覽不輟，余以共非病中所宜，勸阻之。倐忽一年餘，以余之懶於訪舊，竟未一往。上月接其手書，有「長為閉戶之人，幸神識不减，尙能讀書」，展書不覺秤然，蓋可以五相訪問之人而不相往來，其失惟均，無傷也；若樸安之不能訪人，自惟有可以走訪者往訪之，若可訪而亦不往訪，則失其應有之義矣。故余雖懶於訪友，至是亦不得不重鼓勇氣，以造安居也。</p>
<p>樸安經兩年來之靜養，收效不少，病已去其十之七，惟左足稍不良於行耳。修髯如銀絲，雖一度被薙，而今依然飄拂似神仙中人。太極拳劍以病廢，但炯炯之目光，氣概軒昂，仍不讓施公案中演出之褚彪也。話舊閒談之外，亦談到吃飯問題之艱難。</p>
<p>樸安云：以余之食量，米無論高貴至如何地步，影響尙微。余謂是不可與君一概論，惟以君之豐采；精神奕奕，其攝生之必有術乎？遂進而談樸安之吃飯藝術。</p>
<p>樸安云：戰前每餐非三碗不放手；自戰事作，米價日以貴，食量遞相减，而今巳去其三之二，每日祇食一碗飯，當舉茶盃相示云；傾其中，亦不過一盃耳！則以意度之，其所節省豈止三二，實巳四三，而樸安之精神未嘗有所减，閱書記憶之力，反覺比前增，於以見節食有方，固無妨於健康也</p>
<p>樸安一日三餐，朝暮雨粥，中午一飯，每餐以一盞為度。所食雖少，而用於咀嚼之時間則甚長，無論其為粥為飯，大約每含食一口，非咀嚼至粥飯盡成薄糊狀不下咽，換言之，即粥飯非徒不有完顆嚥下，即咀嚼尙有渣滓殘留者，亦必待其與唾液混成一體，方為盡其吃飯之能事；是以一盌之飯，至少非二十分鐘不辦，因之絲毫無浪費，粒粒入胃中，用以充營養，助活力，較之每食三四盌者，未嘗有不及；每日七小時之著作，未嘗以為勞，四五小時之睡眠，未嘗以為少，一年三十餘萬言，未嘗以為多；應接談論，仍綽乎有餘裕；食不在多，而在乎咀嚼之精，以今日之艱於食，足可取式。</p>
<p>且橫安所長尤不止此，人之談節食言衛生者，則必集牛乳雞卵水果蔬菜魚肉之精，若某焉多脂肪，某焉含蛋白，某焉富維他命，某焉有鐵質燐質，某焉有葉綠素，惟如是調和得宜，而後可以收營養之實，得養生之要，享長命之樂，此則即使得成功，貴族化之生活，遑論今日之高物價，即在舊時，亦非一般富有資產者不易得其實現，惟樸安之方式，果有實心行之者，樸實易安，毫不覺其為費，並將以為可學而不可及，蓋樸安每餐，不尙佐餐，如粥則白粥，飯則白飯，飯畢，僅取一盅靑菜，細細咀嚼，嚥其精，屏其渣，舍此無所謂餚饌，更無所謂雞子牛乳，而樸安亦不為此而覺健康上有何種缺點，反致原有之病體，得以日見康復。然樸安非僅為節食有方，亦得力於靜攝，蓋每日三次西小時功夫之靜坐，大有裨於健康，亦未可抹却。眞所謂</p>
<p>咀嚼功夫深　粒粒生精神。</p>
<p>有米難買食　靜養攝天眞。</p>
<p>節食可以延年，多食反以戕生，此則不論其為米麵為魚肉果蔬，利弊則一。但世俗以多食為貴，健康時如此，病中亦如此。夫病中之食，最為緊要，一不愼，適以增病，蓋病中固不可缺營養，而飲食仍宜謹愼。昔之西醫不重忌食，並以為非，而今亦多知某焉宜忌，某焉宜節，此可知飲食之於疾病健康，有不可分隔之關係。樸安此舉，在一般高談營養者或且以為不足，余亦未嘗不作是想。但樸安言其不然，只要行之有方，持之以恒，雖少無害，雖陋無妨，雖有八小時工作不覺為累，亦猶兵不在多而在乎精，精之義，非珍饈玉食之謂，乃為咀嚼之精，使一粒有一粒之營養，一菜有一菜之功用，如是而巳矣。言雖如此，但如杭育邪許之輩，每日所耗費之熱力甚大，樸安之方式，或許有所難能耳。</p>
<p>惟節食為中國最古之養生術，張良辟穀，即其一也；後世談修養言長生者尤重之。近如美人麥凱從實騐之結果，亦以常帶幾分饑餓可以延年，與中國養生術及若要小兒安，常帶三分饑和寒之說相符合。西人常譏中國人所食太多，確乎中國世俗之見，徒知食物可資營養，而不顧其能否消化有益，見健啖者，以為是固得養生之道。如小說中稱「將軍三箭定天山，將士長歌入漢關」之薛仁貴，嘗言其食量如何之大，以為美談，但史書未之見。然如安史之亂時，唐將張興，一飯至斗米，肉十斤，擐甲持陌刀，重五十斤，確亦有其人，但究竟食量大者常患腸胃病。若樸安之吃粥飯，可說便宜了胃，吃虧了齒；蓋折磨着牙齒，使食物成為薄糊，胃腸儘可吸收，省却不少工作。有謂老年人糞充肥料，比壯年為良，為其消化不盡，故窒素較多，若如樸安之消化，不將使糞頭失望，畎畎與嗟？然而樸安之吃飯方式，固為糧荒時代一般所宜注意也。（柳塘）</p>

<p>第二步工作，敎育聾啞非短時期即奏功效，亦須如普通見童，按步就班，順序前進，能以讀完高級小學，即可與普通人往來筆談，謀職業亦即不成難題，是以六名啞生亟宜入學校，全日受特殊敎育。目前生活　度日高，該校經濟困窘，但對敎育管理費用，願籌畫完全免費義務，惟衣食問題，有賴於社會熱心人士之幫助，特此為聾啞難童請命，敬向各界大慈善家呼援，慨解仁囊，造福聾啞，功德無量。如願担任一人或數人之衣食費者，請通知福啞學校，當即趨前接洽辦理，福啞學校校址卡德路黃家沙花園路三十三號，電話三二九四八。</p>

<p>— 自新</p>
<p>愛之存在於人與人間，予人類進化以莫大助力，要是人類沒有相互的愛，千萬年前的世界早無法想像了。</p>
<p>予人類以莫大助力的愛，是無我的。為他人謀永世的幸福，甘願犧牲自己，這精神是多麼偉大，然而可怪，自從人類靠托無我的愛進化之後，愛似乎不自主地被速帶有了「進化」，居然從無我中分裂出偏私來了。</p>
<p>試看今日的人類，為自身的私慾，殺了長兄；為自身的生活，這使女兒出賣肉體；為自身的財富，居然驅使千百萬人上死亡綫去！</p>
<p>難道說這些人無「愛」存留在心底裹嗎？不，不，一百廿個不！殺死長兄，為的愛他的錢財；逼女買淫，為的愛他們的生命；驅使他人上饑餓錢去，為的愛他們的錢財和生命。</p>
<p>巳經說過，這種愛是偏私的，但並不是無法轉變，即祗要着手他們的「事業」以前，能够憑理智鄭重考慮一下，予他人是否有善？能為旁人着想也即就是愛人，由愛人產生出愛羣的觀念來，於是纔能回復到普天下的無我的愛去！</p>
<p>試想想看，我們怎樣着手恢復普天下無我的愛呢？</p>
<h3 id="c67">談談駐顏術 <a href="#c67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— 惰之餘</p>
<p>聽說梅蘭芳將到上海來了，而且還預備剃去留着的短鬚「露臉」，這不消說，是使「梅迷」們大為高興的事。</p>
<p>「迎梅」之類的大文自有人做的，不過，不知是甚麼緣故，却想起了駐顏術。梅博士的年紀我雖不熟悉，但扮起妙齡花旦而能勝任愉快—使老看客覺得如十數年前所見的一樣，那麼一定是所謂「駐顏有術」了。—駐顏而有「術」，說來也是一種「學問」，而且也頗為走運，靠色相賣藝的伶人明星不消說是極為重視的，就是不以為「討飯鉢」的太太小姐們也考究這一套；把面孔粉飾起來，於是不得不借重一些美容化妝品，同時也產生了蜜司佛陀之流的專家來。</p>
<p>可是，靑春的永駐，乞靈於「專家」與化妝品已呈拙劣的方法，而是舍本求末了。美容術我想最多是駐顏術的一個部門—而眞正的駐顏術，說來是不值一錢，做來却很難，即是有錢有閒是。</p>
<p>以錢來買閒，則閒得舒服，不愁軋米的憂煩，又何必問及日曬夜露；天天吃着大魚肉，則面上也自會生出油光與紅潤，而茶飯之餘，打打盹，散散步，雙重衛生，兼而有之，同時以舒適的心情再作閒適的美容，於是駐了顏焉—這也即是「下等女子」與這些太太小姐們的不同處，同是娘兒們，同運用美容術，可是在華燈初上，她們面上的蒼老也映現了出來，脂粉口紅掩不住生活的烙印，的悒鬱。這道理也可見「駐顏」之不易。</p>
<p>為了生活的鞭笞，為了擔荷堅艱的工作，我會見過一些人們，年紀是很靑，血管裏雖為着靑春的血液，而容顏的光彩，即所謂漂亮與派頭却逝去得道麼快。反之，我也會見過些有閒有錢的人們，他們年齡在「不惑」以上了，伸出手來，倒軟如柔荑，白如雪玉，沒瞧見半點生活的繭跡。我除了觀賞他們的「駐顏有術」外，也不敢希望與跟隨他們的生活—這是一種多麼相異的生活，而也非凡人俗子所能亨受的。我覺得。</p>

<p>— 愛侍</p>
<p>擁擠的三等電車廂裏上來了一個老年婦人。在我還不會想到「婦女居先」Ladies　first一語之前，我巳覺得她應該據有一個座位了，雖然我沒有座位可以讓給她。這樣，直至車在一個站頭停下來，許多乘客下去了時，她才得到了一個座位。</p>
<p>又上來了一個中年婦人，她瞧見那位老年婦人旁邊的空位子，便急急的走過去。正坐下去的時候，車子開動了，她的腿因之輕撞在老年婦人的膝蓋上，她就抱歉地向老年婦人一笑。我的視錢不自主地跟着她的視綫投到老年婦人的臉上，使我失望的是，我所看到的，是一副長而扳着的臉，那中年婦人忙收住了笑臉，顯出難受的樣子。我的同情心便從老年婦人轉移到中年婦人的身上</p>
<p>又到了一站。</p>
<p>一個靑年女子走到那位中年婦人的前面，要求她向旁邊靠得緊些，好讓她挿身下去。出乎我的意外，中年婦人只勉强動了動上身，而不肯移動她坐着的地位；分明她的左右兩方，各有半個空位子。</p>
<p>我的同情心幾乎消失了。這時，我似乎聽得耶穌在向世人說：「你們願意人怎樣待你們，你們亦要怎樣待人！」</p>

<p>— 葛亮</p>
<p>和上海久別了的馬，現在又回滬馳騁了。牠遇到了黃包車夫，便互相攀談起來了。</p>
<p>「老友，別來無恙？」</p>
<p>「啊，四脚子，拉媽媽你好？」</p>
<p>「托福。聽說近來你們發達了。」</p>
<p>「勒一個說的？唔家依舊老樣子，你呢？」</p>
<p>於是馬吿訴他，自從汽車絕跡後，牠到這裏是來稱王的，所以以後，黃包車應該恭而敬之的讓牠昂視闊步的在路中心走，黃包車祗可在路旁走，否則牠說牠要發下馬威的。</p>
<p>「乖乖不得了！你在兩根車槓中間走，唔家也在兩根車槓中間走，啥的要讓你走路中心呀？並且你是馬，唔家是人，那怎麼可以？」</p>
<p>「人也不是什麼了不得的東西，以前我在戰塲上，不知要踐踏多少你的貴同類。所謂人，哼，不過是世界最笨拙的東西罷了！......」接着，牠辱駡起人類來了。</p>

<p>（五）拔來報往</p>
<p>翠珍從國芳說第一句時，便緋紅了臉，紅到後來，裝做搔着腦門子，搖搖頭道：「沒有這話，你聽誰說的？你聽誰說的，沒有這話。」國芳道：「總是有人說，我才聽到，便是沒人說，我也想得到的。翠珍姊，你恰恰是沒有婆婆家。道話我在上一回來，早想說了，因為那時還沒和翠珍姊怎麼熱。」翠珍的紅暈，漸漸褪了，笑道：「我肚子裏沒有文墨，不能和陳小姐比。要是陳小姐還沒和人訂婚，那眞是和城弟一對。」國芳一笑道：「我好像給翠珍姊說過了。」翠珍道：「說是說過了，知道陳小姐是哄我不是。只有陳小姐到這裏來，問這裏的人，這裏的人可以告訴你實話；我不能上雙橋去，上上海去，問人家。」國芳道：「我不成，我不會煮飯者業，我不會管家裏的事。我看的非常淸楚，做維城的夫人，沒有文墨是沒關係，不會管家政才不像個維城夫人。」</p>
<p>翠珍道：「人家要笑我們了，說兩個女孩子，誰都不知道害臊，講這些話。」翠珍說着，要支撑着起牀，國芳按住了她不讓起來。翠珍道：「我巳然好了，沒有關係。」國芳道：「他們去送葬，還有好一會回來，你可以躺一回。我不妨礙你的睡眠，到外邊去看一看，只算是替代你去看一看。」國芳把一條薄被給蓋好了，走到外邊來，又給拽上了房門。</p>
<p>在國芳走到外邊去的時候，翠珍閉了眼，眞想睡一回，可是沒睡着，一陣風把窗吹開了，怕睡着了會着凉，更不敢睡。對屋標怔怔的望了一回，想着葉大太太在這時候，也許是正在登穴，從此便永遠的把她的遺體，埋在一個泥墩裏，明年今日，墳上的草，便長得靑靑的了。翠珍如此一想，又有些傷感，鼻子裏壅塞了一般的。國芳却從外邊推門進來。她推進來，是輕輕的，看翠珍還是睜大了眼，便說：「翠珍姊沒睡着嗎？」翠珍道：「是想聽了陳小姐的話睡的，可是睡不着。外邊有些什麼人？」國芳道：「人是有好幾個。外邊嚝傷，堆起了一大把柴，說是預備他們回來時候燒的，我全不懂是什麼意思。」　（八五）</p>

<p>公共租界將於下月實施計口授糧，法租界當局也在「謀改善食米之分配，俾免米店前之排班擠軋」，這是天大的喜訊，大多數或多或少受過「吃飯的苦痛」的我輩小民，自應額手稱慶。但這喜訊傳出之後，也有人因之而憂慮起來，這是什麼道理？是這些人已經修成正果，不食人間烟火；還是眞的把軋米當作了一種「運動」？非也，都不是。原因是他們家裏正藏着一年半載的糧食，如果計口授糧，旣稱「授」，當然「受」；一「受」之後，這些藏着的米糧，即使是一百或八十時進的，以之作為老鼠及蛀蟲的消耗，豈不肉痛？而且以這些錢囤積其他日用品或西藥之類，其利潤史是算不淸楚了。</p>
<p>不過，由此證明了目今不是個「關起門來」的時代，懷着「人瘦獨肥」的意念終於要碰壁的，如果留意近日的分類廣吿的話，這些人的「憂慮」已在接踵而至了。</p>

<p>花一塊錢買一匣「上等火柴」，劃了一根又是一根，好容易才燃着了火，不到三五天，便吿「空空如也」。</p>
<p>前日走過福州路，看見幾家店舖都貼着「火刀火石零躉批發」的字條，忽然想起備一套下來，取火豈不經濟得多。</p>
<p>以一元半的代價，買了一塊小小的石頭和一柄鐵條似的小刀。到家之後，試騐了好多次，總打不出火來，不免又怪自己太魯莽，當時沒有問明夥計，究竟如何打火。</p>
<p>「你何不去問問年紀大的人，他們用過這種東西。」</p>
<p>學到老，學不了，如今我又得學一套「打火術」了。</p>
<p>拿去請教隔壁的黃老太，她看了搖搖頭：</p>
<p>「這東西還是我小時候見到過，但那時我父親在外面經商，家里早已用自來火，記不淸怎樣打法了。」</p>
<p>對門的老娘姨見了，便拿去試試，祇見打出幾個火星，燃不着火。</p>
<p>「麻煩得很呢。記得先要預備幾根紙吹，打起來要費點勁，不可性急......我小時候到熟手，現在却不慣了。」</p>
<p>我很是失望。</p>
<p>這一類落伍了器具，本來早被送進博物院，二十世紀是物質文明最進步的時代，科學解決了一切的問題，不久的將來，以火柴取火，或許也要認為不便利了，誰還想得到火刀火石呢！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Fierce Battles at Kharkiv for Two Weeks Have Not Yet Reached a Decisive Stage, Main Force Struggles Move to the Izyum Area, German Forces are Counterattacking, the Situation is Confused <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Havas Agency dispatch from somewhere on the Soviet border, dated 24th: The Battle of Kharkiv has lasted for two weeks, but according to the latest news, the battle has not yet reached a decisive stage. Both Germany and the Soviet Union claim victory. According to the German side, the Red Army has adopted a defensive posture everywhere, and the Battle of Kharkiv has entered "the second stage." The so-called second stage is said to be beneficial to the German army. German war reports claim that after the German counterattack, a large number of Red Army troops south of Kharkiv have been surrounded by the German army. The Soviet side claims that the Red Army's offensive is still progressing, but Axis forces are encircling the Red Army in the Losovaya and Izyum areas. The fighting in the northeastern Kharkiv area has been quiet for five days, but is now becoming fierce again. Last night, the Red Army attacked the Lipetsk-Kharkiv line and, after a fierce battle, captured Lipetsk. According to military sources, the Red Army has received reinforcements and is strong enough to launch an offensive. The Red Army General Staff hopes that the offensive in northeastern Kharkiv can relieve the pressure on the German forces in the Izyum area. The German forces led by General Bock have a large number of personnel and are sufficient to cope with any Red Army offensive. Moreover, the German army has had ample time to build strong defenses. It is undeniable that the German air force has an absolute advantage, which has greatly affected General Timoshenko, because no matter from which direction an offensive is launched to relieve the siege of northeastern Kharkiv, it is necessary to take into account the advantage of the German air force. The fighting in the Izyum area is still fierce, which is of great importance, not only determining the fate of the Battle of Kharkiv, but also the success or failure of the Red Army's offensive on the southern route depends on this. According to German sources, no less than 40,000 Red Army troops are trapped in the Izyum pocket. Last night, the Red Army repeatedly attempted to break through the encirclement and attack the Slavyansk line, which is probably one of the weakest points in the German defenses. It is reported that some points have been broken through, but they were met with resolute resistance from the German army. After a fierce battle, the northern side of the pocket was finally broken. The Red Army is only eight miles away from the city of Novosebkov. The battles on other fronts are also becoming increasingly fierce, and there are various signs that a large-scale war will intensify and spread to various theaters.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from London, dated 25th: Tonight, official war reports from Moscow stated that the Red Army, advancing towards Kharkiv, has resumed its offensive after consolidating its positions occupied in Benkuti. According to the Soviet midday communique, "The Soviet forces in several areas of the Kharkiv front have consolidated their positions and are now engaged in offensive operations. The Soviet forces in the Izyum and Barvenkovo areas continue to fight fiercely with German tanks and infantry. There were no major events in other areas of the front." London sources believe that the main force struggle between the forces led by Soviet General Timoshenko and German General Bock has shifted from the Kharkiv area to the Izyum front, where the German army is currently counterattacking, and the situation is quite chaotic. A report in today's "Krasnaya Flot" newspaper of the Soviet Navy described an encounter between a Soviet light warship and German tanks. Before the end of the Battle of Kerch, the Soviet warship was patrolling near the coast, providing artillery support, when it was suddenly attacked by German tanks and damaged. However, the gunners continued to bombard, blocking the tanks, until all the crew members were taken away by a steamer.</p>
<p>Alliance Agency dispatch from Lisbon, dated 24th: According to Berlin sources, German Führer Hitler convened an emergency special meeting of generals at the front line headquarters on the 24th. After the meeting, he also had important discussions with Marshal Göring, and then returned to Berlin. At a time when the German and Soviet armies on the Eastern Front are engaged in fierce battles, Hitler's discussions with the generals are quite noteworthy.</p>
<p>Hitler Holds Meeting with Generals at the Front Line</p>
<p>Haitong Agency dispatch from the German Führer's Headquarters, dated 25th: This afternoon, German war reports stated that most of the three Soviet divisions fighting in Kharkiv were heavily besieged, and the elite troops of the armored forces were also trapped. Although the enemy repeatedly attempted to break through, they failed and suffered heavy losses. Our army, fighting in the central sector, captured 30 locations. Enemy forces southeast of Lake Ilmen launched several attacks, all of which were repulsed. In the Lapland area, German and Finnish allied forces fought hard for several weeks, and enemy forces were annihilated, reaching several divisions. The 19th Motorized Bicycle Team of our army, regardless of the difficult terrain, broke into the heavily defended, fortress-strewn ladder formation. In the Gulf of Kandalaksha area, German dive bomber groups destroyed an important railway bridge, which is a key point for the passage of the Murmansk Railway.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Large-Scale War is About to Begin, German and Soviet Forces Each Have Three Hundred Divisions <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Alliance Agency dispatch from Lisbon, dated 23rd: According to Angola Broadcasting, the German army's large-scale war preparations will be completed within ten days, and a major operation will begin. Currently, 72,000 to 82,000 Hungarian troops have arrived on the Eastern Front. Romania and Italy have also sent large forces. In addition, Germany has assembled 300 divisions on the Eastern Front. The Soviet Union has also assembled 300 divisions on the Kharkiv and Moscow lines, especially more on the Moscow front.</p>
<p>Havas Agency dispatch from Budapest, dated 24th: The Chairman of the Hungarian War Veterans Association, Reviczky, stated in a speech in Kolozsvár today, "We have always believed that an anti-communist war will sooner or later occur. Only the arrogant believe that the Soviet Union can allow Hungary to exist. Therefore, our country is now engaged in a holy war. At this time, our countrymen should no longer engage in endless discussions, causing disputes within the country, or disputes with neighboring countries. This kind of action is harmful to Europe and has no benefit."</p>
<p>Havas Agency dispatch from Madrid, dated 24th: The Spanish volunteer army "Blue Division," stationed on the Eastern Front, will have 1,300 members whose term is expiring. They are scheduled to return to the port of San Sebastián today. A new team of soldiers is scheduled to leave for Germany tomorrow to replace them.</p>
<p>Haitong Agency dispatch from Berlin, dated 25th: Today, the German High Command announced that the German army in the Kharkiv operation is progressing according to plan. Most of the three Soviet divisions have been trapped south of Kharkiv. Recent Soviet war reports also admitted that the Germans had broken into the Soviet positions in Kharkiv. There is fierce fighting in the area from Izyum to Barvenkovo. The German army in the central and northern sections of Eastern Europe has achieved victories in both offense and defense. A German commando suddenly appeared northeast of Voronezh, broke into the Soviet positions at night, occupied several locations, and then attacked a village heavily defended by Soviet elite troops, making continuous progress. The Soviet troops abandoned the defended houses, fled in cars, and left behind a large amount of military equipment and supplies, which were completely destroyed by the German army. Then, the commando returned to the German positions with some prisoners. In addition to assisting the army in combat, German aircraft flew low to disperse enemy tank columns and supply trains. Twenty enemy aircraft were shot down by German fighter planes.</p>
<p>Havas Agency dispatch from Berlin, dated 24th: A German military spokesman stated that the German High Command will soon release information on the losses of the Soviet army on the Kharkiv front, which can prove the large number of troops used by the Soviet Union and the heavy losses. Therefore, it is not difficult to speculate on the collapse of the war situation. As for the recent situation in Kharkiv, no news has been received here. German radio stations only released detailed information on the war in the past few days, saying that the development of the war is beneficial to the German army. The German army in the Donets River basin has also increased its artillery fire, and the Soviet army has suffered increasing losses. At one location on the line, 45 Soviet tanks were destroyed yesterday. In addition, the German air force was very successful in bombing enemy tank columns and destroyed three bridgeheads on the Donets River.</p>
<p>Alliance Agency dispatch from Kuibyshev, dated 24th: The Soviet Information Bureau announced last night the war situation in the Kharkiv area in recent days, which mentioned that the German army had begun an offensive, briefly stating that on the 23rd, the Soviet army on the Kharkiv-Izyum front was attacked by German tanks and infantry, and the situation in various places was still in a stalemate. On the same day, the German army in the Izyum area launched an even more fierce major offensive, and the Soviet army is currently resisting vigorously.</p>

When these individuals encountered difficulties, they often sought help from their homeland, which generously provided it. Therefore, the establishment of the British Empire was not due to hegemonic policies, but to a cooperative method based on benevolence. Cooper then discussed the current war situation, acknowledging that this was the first time in the empire's history that it had faced threats from all sides, and the situation was indeed extremely serious.</p>

<p>Bucharest, Romania, 25th (Havas News Agency) - The Romanian authorities are currently studying plans to expand the national railway network. Romania recently concluded an economic agreement with the Axis powers, which stipulates that Romania should develop railway transportation in the future Europe. Because, until now, Romania's railway transportation has lagged behind other European countries, it is necessary to actively find ways to build railways. The required funds are approximately 10 billion lei (Romanian currency). A five-year plan has been drafted, with 140 miles of roads built each year. Construction will begin first in the Bessarabia region and southern Romania, and a railway bridge will be built over the Danube River to facilitate transportation between Romania and the Dobruja region.</p>
<p>Bucharest, Romania, 25th (Havas News Agency) - Semi-official sources say that in recent times, customs have deteriorated and people's hearts are not as they used to be.

<h3 id="e29">A Comparison of German and French Strength at the Beginning of the War in Europe <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Vichy, 25th (Haitong News Agency) - The weakness of the French military strength, which was discussed in the Lyon trial, has now been announced by French magazines based on the prosecutor's indictment. It is said that at the beginning of France's entry into the war, it had only 111 divisions, while Germany had 170 divisions on the Western Front. In May 1940, the French army's strength increased to 115 divisions, but the German army increased to 180 divisions. In January 1940, the French armory had only 5,000 old-fashioned rifles. By April of the same year, it was unable to manufacture automatic pistols, new machine guns, trench mortars, and hand grenades. On the day of the French mobilization, there were only 2,108 tanks, while the German army had 4,200 tanks. By May 1940, the French army's tanks increased to 3,160, but the German army's tanks increased to 8,000. At that time, France had only one anti-aircraft gun that could shoot down aircraft below 1,500 meters. There was also only one anti-aircraft gun with a caliber of 75 cm that could shoot down aircraft between 1,500 meters and 5,000 meters. There were no 99 cm anti-aircraft guns at all. From this, it can be seen that France had no weapons to deal with aircraft above 5,000 meters. The French army needed to consume 1 million 75 cm shells per day in Verdun, but on the day of the French army's mobilization, there were only 12 million shells. There were also no new-style large-caliber cannons or heavy mines. All that existed could be destroyed by infantry gunfire. The equipment of other military supplies was also incomplete. On September 1, 1939, France had only 1,410 aircraft, most of which were old-fashioned. By May 10, 1940, the number of French aircraft had increased to 1,730, but only 1,310 of them were new-style aircraft. In contrast, on September 1, 1939, Germany had 10,000 new-style aircraft, and by May 10, 1940, it had increased to 15,700. Italy also had 2,500 aircraft. From this, it can be seen one aspect of the weakness of the French military strength.</p>

<h3 id="e33">The Soviet Union's Petroleum <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>The Soviet Union is now the world's second-largest oil-producing country, second only to the United States, the world's largest oil-producing country. Its oil production in 1938 was 202.3 million barrels, in 1939 it was 216.5 million barrels, and in 1940 it was 225 million barrels. One barrel equals 45 gallons, and assuming 7 barrels equals one metric ton, then the Soviet Union's production in the most recent year was 30 million metric tons. Although this cannot catch up with the United States, the world's largest oil-producing country, which produces 180 million metric tons per year, accounting for about 61 percent of the world's total production, it is enough to rank first among other countries.</p>
<p>However, the Soviet Union's status as the world's second-largest oil producer is only a recent development. From the end of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century, it has always competed with the advanced United States for oil hegemony. Although it was only for a few years, around the turn of the century, the Soviet Union once dominated the world's oil production. Since the beginning of this century, due to the rapid development of the American oil industry, a great difference has occurred in the output of both sides. Even so, the Soviet Union has always occupied the second position. Its descent below second place was limited to the few years when the revolution occurred in the country and the oil industry was in a state of stagnation.</p>
<p>The Center of Oil Production</p>
<p>So, where is this large amount of oil produced? Currently, the oil fields that produce oil within the Soviet Union can be roughly divided into the following areas: the Caucasus region, the Ural region, Central Asia, and the Far East. Among them, until recently, the Caucasus region produced more than 90 percent of the oil produced within the Soviet Union. Recently, due to the increase in oil production in other regions, the percentage has decreased slightly compared to before, but it still maintains a record of about 88 percent, and it is still the center of the Soviet oil industry.</p>
<p>If we set up the oil fields in the Caucasus region, we can further subdivide them into the following three oil fields: the Baku oil field, the Grozny oil field, and the Maikop oil field.</p>
<p>Just as the center of the Soviet oil industry is the Caucasus, the center of the Caucasus oil industry is the Baku oil field. In fact, the Soviet oil industry started with the Baku oil field. At the beginning of this century, the output of the Baku oil field accounted for 100% to 97% of the total output. Later, as new oil fields were discovered one after another, its proportion gradually decreased, but its output has always increased, and it still maintains the status of the central oil field of the Soviet Union today.</p>
<p>The Oil Fields of the Caucasus</p>
<p>In the northwest corner of the Asian continent, near the border with Europe, lies the Black Sea, the Caspian Sea, and the Sea of Azov, forming a complex terrain. Between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea lies a vast isthmus-shaped land, connecting the borders of Asia and Europe. This isthmus-shaped part is the Caucasus region. In the center of this area, a large mountain range stretches across, which is the famous Caucasus Mountains, extending from northwest to southeast for 750 miles.</p>
<p>The surrounding rolling hills of the Caucasus Mountains have been famous since ancient times for their rich oil springs and asphalt deposits. One part of the hills in the eastern part of this mountain range protrudes into the Caspian Sea, forming a small island called Apsheron. This island has many oil springs and asphalt deposits. And to the south of this peninsula is a small port called Baku. Because this is actually the center of the peninsula's oil business, the peninsula's oil fields have been collectively called the Baku oil field.</p>
<p>The Baku oil field was stimulated by the rise of the American oil industry and began to rise in 1875. The naturally rich oil layers allowed it to quickly surpass the advanced United States.</p>
<p>Following the Baku oil field, the Grozny and Maikop oil fields were successively discovered on the northern foothills of the Caucasus Mountains. Grozny's oil production reached one million barrels in 1895 and ten million barrels in 1914. As for the Maikop oil field, it did not reach one million barrels until 1928. It can be seen that these two oil fields only began to occupy an important position in the Caucasus in the last ten years.</p>
<p>The Grozny oil field is located in the east of the northern foothills of the mountain range, close to the Caspian Sea, only 90 miles from the coast. Conversely, Maikop is in the west, 130 miles from the Sea of Azov. The distance between the two oil fields is approximately 300 miles.</p>
<p>The Mission of the Petroleum Industry</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's oil production surged to 80 million barrels in 1901. However, not only was there no increase after that, but it was gradually declining. On the one hand, this was due to the depletion of the Baku oil field, and on the other hand, it was due to the repeated strikes by oil workers. Originally, the sharp increase in oil production caused the oil price to fall, and the fall in the oil price indirectly led to the reduction of wages. Workers demanded higher wages and often carried out strikes as a threat, which resulted in the further decline of the already shrinking Baku oil industry.</p>
<p>However, a major event that required the liquidation of everything in the past occurred in 1918, that is, the invasion of the Baku area by the Red Army. From March 1918 to May 1920, the Baku oil field was completely turned into a bloody battlefield, and there was no room for oil production at all. Therefore, the oil production in that year also dropped sharply to 25 million barrels.</p>
<p>On May 28, 1920, the Soviet government nationalized all oil industries in the area. At that time, the number of factories confiscated reached 309, and the total capital was 954.48 million rubles.</p>
<p>Since being nationalized, the speed of development of the Soviet oil industry has been amazing. Oil production began to increase year by year. Of course, its main force was the oil fields in the Caucasus region, with Baku as the center. If we express the increased production in numbers, it would be roughly like this: The production of only 25 million barrels in 1920 doubled to 52 million barrels in 1925, surged to 125 million barrels in 1920, and by 1933 it had become seven or eight times the 182 million barrels when it began to be state-owned. Among them, during the five years from 1928 to 1932, according to the First Five-Year Plan, it increased from 85 million barrels in 1928 to 154 million barrels in 1932, an average annual increase of 14 million barrels. The Second Five-Year Plan began in 1933, and by 1927 it had increased to 195 million barrels, an average annual increase of 8 million barrels. As for the subsequent production, it has been described in detail at the beginning of this article, so there is no need to repeat it here.</p>
<p>Newly Discovered Oil Fields</p>
<p>Above, we have established that the Soviet government has successively implemented five-year plans to increase oil production, and at the same time, it has discovered many new oil fields. This is naturally quite beneficial to increasing the total national output, but there is only one place that shows a rapid development. That is the new oil field discovered in the Ural region.</p>
<p>The Ural region belongs to the Paleozoic strata, and no one thought that there would be any oil here. However, in 1928, when exploring for potassium mines, the drill bit actually touched the source of petroleum. As a result of efforts to develop it, 2.9 million barrels were extracted in 1935, and 13.6 million barrels could be extracted in 1939.</p>
<p>The oil fields in the Central Asian region can be divided into: The Emba oil field and several other oil fields on the eastern coast of the Caspian Sea, The Fergana oil field in Turkestan</p>
<p>As for the Soviet Union's oil industry in the Far East, it refers to the oil field in the northern part of Sakhalin Island</p>
<p>The oil production in the Central Asian and Far Eastern oil fields accounted for 2.8% of the total Soviet oil production in 1936, increased to 3.9% in 1937, and surged to 6.4% in 1938.</p>
<p>Among them, the oil production on Sakhalin Island is estimated to be more than 4 million barrels, according to reliable estimates. In addition, near Lake Baikal, the Soviet authorities have been engaged in test drilling for oil, and according to recent literature, it seems that a small amount of oil has been extracted.</p>
<p>The above is a general overview of the Soviet Union's oil resources. In short, the center is still the Baku oil field, which accounts for about 90% of the domestic production and produces 22 million metric tons per year. This oil field and the important port of Batumi on the Black Sea are connected by a 560-mile railway and several oil pipelines. Its passage is on the lowlands south of the Caucasus Mountains, with very few natural barriers that can be relied upon for defense. Batumi is the export point of Baku oil, and there is a large-scale oil refinery here. If the Soviet Union were to lose control of the Black Sea, Baku would become a tooth without lips.</p>
<p>Baku, the city in the Soviet oil-producing area, has been modernized. The picture shows the scene of Gubanov Street.</p>

The retail price of foreign rice sold by various rice shops today has changed to 7 yuan and 2 jiao per half liter. The details are noted below:</p>
<p>The Price of Whole Bags of Council Rice Has Also Increased</p>
<p>Yesterday, rice shops in the two concessions purchased rice from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Management Office, and the price per bag in legal tender increased to 504 yuan. The rice allocated yesterday can be sold by the rice shops after being picked up from the warehouse on Thursday. The total number is more than 10,000 bags. Designated rice outlets are: Mitsubishi Warehouse on North Yangtzepoo Road, Jardine Matheson Warehouse on the Bund in the French Concession, and Zhejiang Yuye Warehouse on North Soochow Road.</p>
<p>Deadline for Applications from Closed Rice Shops</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Management Office announced that closed rice shops (excluding those whose licenses were revoked for violating regulations) could apply in writing to reopen. The application deadline has now passed. More than 400 closed rice shops have submitted applications. The Council is currently reviewing them. However, the rice shop industry hopes that all applications will be approved. According to general speculation, the Council's notice states that "submitting an application to the Council does not mean that reopening is permitted." Therefore, it is feared that the overall reopening is hopeless.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice in All Warehouses Has Been Sold Out</p>
<p>It is also learned that the foreign rice in the Shanghai &amp; Whampoa Wharf warehouse in Yangtzepoo has been sold out. As for the foreign rice stored in warehouses north and south of the Soochow Creek, Chengdu Road, Xiamen Road, Baker Road, and the Bund in the French Concession before December 8 of last year, the Council has continuously allocated and sold them to various rice shops. The rice currently being sold is all coarse rice that has recently arrived, and there should be no shortage.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Warehouse in Yangtzepoo Carelessly Caught Fire the Night Before Last <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>According to the English Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, a warehouse at 1196 Yangtzepoo Road carelessly caught fire at 11:30 PM last night (the 24th). The fire was very fierce and was not extinguished until dawn today (the 25th). A large amount of waste cotton was burned, but no one was injured. It is heard that the warehouse has two floors, and only the upper floor was used to store waste cotton. The fire started on the upper floor. Because waste cotton is very flammable, the burning was very intense. The firelight could be seen for miles. As a result, only the shells of the upper floor and roof of the warehouse remain. However, the lower floor was not severely damaged. The fire brigade rushed to the scene to put out the fire. Because the windows of the warehouse were equipped with iron bars, the work was greatly hindered. Fortunately, the fire chief of the Yangtzepoo Fire Brigade, General Garnell, and the acting director of the Fire Prevention Association, Hua Jin, arrived at the scene to direct the operation, which prevented the flames from spreading to the lower floor of the warehouse and neighboring houses. The losses from this fire cannot be estimated, but it is believed to be quite large, as the warehouse occupies an area of about 1,800 square feet.</p>
<h3 id="e36">House Sublet Licenses to Be Discontinued Soon; Prosecution for Failure to Obtain License by Deadline; Total Number Issued Reaches 40,000 <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's issuance of house sublet licenses to second landlords, which began on the first day of last month and continued until yesterday, has reached a total of only 41,045. Very few people have been collecting them recently. Yesterday, only one license was issued in the Central District, seven in the Western District, two in the Northern District, and three in the Eastern District. The deadline for obtaining these licenses was originally the end of last month. However, due to the possibility that some second landlords were not fully aware of the consequences, the deadline was extended by fifteen days from May 1st. However, a late fee of five yuan was required for supplementary collection during this period. The deadline was then extended again for fifteen days until the end of this month. With the deadline approaching, it is said that prosecution will be initiated and penalties imposed if licenses are not obtained by the deadline.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Shanghai-Ningbo Shipping Line: Four Ships Operating; Haitong and Wanji Sail to Ningbo One After Another <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Ningbo shipping route remains as congested as ever lately. Every time a ship sails to Ningbo, all cabin space is sold out, leaving many people disappointed. The Haitong of the Zhejiang Eastern Shipping Company and the Wanji of the Shanghai-Ningbo Shipping Company generally sail to Ningbo every four or five days, barring special circumstances. These two ships departed for Ningbo on the previous and yesterday, respectively. According to the East Asia Maritime Transport Society's company and ticket office, the scheduled sailing date for the Changshan is set for the 27th of this month, and the Hualin will also depart on the same day. It is reported that the Changshan will carry thirty coffins of fellow villagers to be buried in their hometown this time.</p>
<p>According to other sources, after changing ownership, the German ship Haifulen was renamed Wansheng and underwent repairs in the dock. The newspaper has previously reported that she would resume service on schedule. Now, according to maritime industry sources, the ship will soon set sail, operating mainly to ports north of the Yangtze River. Furthermore, the Gaodeng, formerly owned by the German company Rudolf Lindemann, has been renamed Dafeng after becoming a Chinese enterprise and began sailing to Hupu on the 21st, with a sailing every two days.</p>
<h3 id="e38">The Danger Period for Smallpox Has Not Passed; Remarks by Health Commissioner Jordan <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reports that Public Health Commissioner Jordan stated this morning (the 25th) in an interview that it would be overly optimistic and premature to claim that smallpox is no longer prevalent this year due to the widespread vaccination campaign. Smallpox in the city sometimes occurs in May, but not necessarily. The most dangerous period is in June, so we cannot be complacent until August has passed. Currently, health authorities are still vigilant against the spread of smallpox this year. Any epidemic either originates locally or is transmitted from elsewhere. If it originates locally, it remains dormant in the area and can erupt at any time. There is much debate about which category smallpox in Shanghai falls into. He personally believes it should be classified as imported, so the best way to prevent smallpox is to stop large numbers of people from coming to Shanghai. In addition, there are various preventive measures, such as vaccination and preventing unclean water sources.</p>

<p>Besides these salesmen who make a living from commissions, one often sees Jewish vendors in the streets, hawking their wares loudly. They mainly sell soap, shoelaces, woolen fabrics, and other light daily necessities. They speak broken Chinese, which looks quite funny, but their courage to survive is praiseworthy.</p>
<p>Buying and Selling, Earning Commissions</p>
<p>Every morning, many Jews gather near the intersection of Sichuan Road and Nanjing Road, near the Central Arcade. Most of them are brokers, choosing this convenient transportation area as their meeting place. Almost everyone carries a briefcase and a small notebook, writing this and that. This is the central area for small money changers. They keenly inquire about market conditions and engage in speculative trading. Many people stand at street corners, counting large stacks of banknotes. US dollars, Japanese military notes, reserve notes, and legal tender change hands repeatedly as they buy and sell. They are also brokers for miscellaneous items such as woolen fabrics, medicines, and cigarettes. Their customers are mostly people within their own circle, and they earn commissions by brokering deals.</p>
<p>Around nine or ten o'clock, these Jewish merchants come out of Hongkou in groups, crossing the Sichuan Road Bridge and arriving at this temporary market. Everyone is dressed smartly, exuding a gentlemanly air. They stand in groups along the sidewalks. Some are talking loudly, some are whispering in each other's ears, some are pacing back and forth alone, and some are quietly calculating accounts in a corner. The two nearby coffee shops are entirely their world. The waitresses diligently serve them, hoping that these stingy people will do well in business and be generous enough to give more than the usual amount of money.</p>
<p>Men and Women Alike, Striving for Survival</p>
<p>From the Central Arcade to the Bund on Beijing Road. Every noon, a large number of Jewish women pour into the Bund Park. Their work is more arduous than others. They go to the park not to escape the hustle and bustle of the city, but simply to find a clean place to eat the bread and other things they brought, as a simple lunch. Some sit on benches, while others lie lazily on the carpet-like grass. Like the men, they are also skilled salespeople, greeting people with charming smiles in the park, hoping they will buy their goods. They have no ideals of a happy family, nor do they want to indulge in romantic dreams. They temporarily abandon the beautiful values of life and struggle in this unfamiliar city to gain a foothold, help their husbands or fathers and brothers, and strive for the material necessities of life.</p>
<h3 id="e41">The Gold Rush <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— Ha Tai</p>
<p>The grand clock in the racecourse is pointing to nine o'clock. The main roads in the city center have awakened from their sleep. Shop assistants yawn as they pull up the iron gates. Piles of "animals" (!), who have been lodging in front of the shops, begin to stir and crawl away in all directions, wrapped in broken mats or tattered bags. From west to east, the long serpent-like lines of trams, chartered rickshaws, and bicycles endlessly disgorge all sorts of modern men and women -- of course, there are also bald, burly men, "half-dead" skinny men, and even those in long robes and gowns or well-dressed "Old Men." Needless to say, these respectable ladies are going to the office, but at least one-third of their so-called "offices" are places called "Silver Houses" or "Yarn Houses," in my opinion.</p>
<p>The ×× Yarn House has only been open for a few days. Piles of half-withered flower baskets still stand in front of the door; the strong smell of fresh paint shoots straight into people's nostrils. At this time, the small rectangular room is already "packed." Some are sitting around a large dining table drinking tea or smoking; some are pacing back and forth; some are sitting alone in a corner reading tabloids; and some are talking very enthusiastically about the market situation, such as "the factory order has been returned" and "today you can turn long." In short, everyone is calmly waiting for the "opening."</p>
<p>In the right corner of the room is a long counter, on which are placed at least a dozen telephone sets of different sizes and heights. Behind the counter hangs a huge blackboard marked with squares, and six or seven male and female staff members sit inside, chatting idly.</p>
<p>Nine thirty.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a chubby, bald-headed middle-aged man stood up in front of the counter and shouted loudly into a regular telephone handset:</p>
<p>"Hello, hello! What's the opening price of Double Horse?"</p>
<p>In an instant, everyone's eyes were focused on him.</p>
<p>"Ah, the opening price is 6,900 yuan!" The man shouted loudly, and a young apprentice-looking man wrote it down on the blackboard.</p>
<p>"Hello, 900—950; 950—7,000; 7,050—100!" A series of hoarse shouts, pinching the handset in his left hand and bending his fingers in his right hand, gesticulating vigorously, the rolled-up section of the snow-white shirt cuffs looked particularly beautiful and moving because of the hand movements.</p>
<p>The whole place was in an uproar. "Buy ten packs at 050!" "Sell three packs!" "Liji enters three packs!" The sounds were all mixed together. Two young girls were writing down accounts non-stop, sweat streaming down their foreheads.</p>
<p>"Now someone is selling at 050 yuan—980—7,000; 70—80; 60—70;... 800—820—"</p>
<p>Another burst of commotion, another burst of "sell ten packs," "sell five packs" sounds. At this time, I was wandering around the room with my newly opened account slip, not knowing what to do.</p>
<p>"It looks like the foundation is weakening, I think you can short." A man in a suit said to his companion.</p>
<p>Since I had no idea, I listened to his advice and quietly ran to the front of the counter and did a short trade of one package.</p>
<p>Sure enough, it dropped from 820 to 500 in one go. I was secretly delighted and calculated that I had already earned about 300 yuan.</p>
<p>In the middle was a period of fluctuating "circling," and the voice of the fat man on the phone became a little hoarse, with saliva all over his lips.</p>
<p>"Now, there are rumors in the market that the factory order has been returned. 7,100—150; 150—200; 200—250... 9,000—9,100! I want 9,000 yuan!" The frantic shouting was simply a little impassioned.</p>
<p>Ah: 9,100 yuan! I calculated in my stomach that 9,100 yuan minus 6,820 yuan equals 2,280 yuan, and the 500 yuan margin is over! I dragged my heavy feet out of the ×× Yarn House weakly.</p>
<p>The next morning, the postman delivered a registered letter:</p>
<p>"Mr. Ha Tai:</p>
<p>Your account sold a package of Bianma factory orders valued at 6,820 yuan, but the opening price this morning reached 9,500 yuan. Our company has settled it on your behalf according to the regulations. After deducting the margin of 500 yuan, you still owe 2,180 yuan. Please settle it as soon as possible!</p>
<p>××</p>
<p>Yarn House"</p>
<p>Oh dear! The 500 yuan margin was still obtained by selling my wife's only jewelry. How can I repay this huge sum?</p>

<h3 id="e42">"Nao Wei" Nerve-Specific Tonic Invented by Dr. Weidan <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Weidan, an expert in neuropathology, has recently invented a special agent that specializes in the treatment of all nervous system diseases and disorders.</p>
<p>The main raw materials used in the production of "Nao Wei" are lecithin contained in nerve cells and the original substance containing iron essence. Therefore, it can have a special effect on the sympathetic nervous system and produce a therapeutic response to diseases, with the same effect as Dr. Weidan's contact nasal membrane therapy. However, Dr. Weidan does not mean that "Nao Wei" can replace his new therapy. However, this medicine is for patients who live far away, cannot come to see a doctor in person, or cannot receive contact nasal membrane therapy often due to work reasons.</p>
<p>"Nao Wei" can treat all nervous system disorders and symptoms caused by weakened blood circulation. "Nao Wei" is most effective for those suffering from neurasthenia. Patients with nerve sensitivity often feel depressed for no reason and often feel pessimistic and suffer. After taking "Nao Wei," they can immediately regain confidence and banish sad thoughts from their minds. If you lose weight and your body is weak, taking it will also have miraculous effects.</p>
<p>The "Nao Wei" invented by Dr. Weidan can strengthen various organs, so it can also treat chronic bronchial and lung cough diseases and asthma. As for patients who have lost their reproductive capacity, they can also restore their youth. This is because the excitement of youth depends on the secretion of glands and the health of the sympathetic nervous system and the activation of its nerve potential. If you initially find that you have impotence and other diseases, taking "Nao Wei" immediately can restore your original health, because this medicine contains a large amount of vitality to enhance the organs and supplement the deficiency of glands. All those who use "Nao Wei" feel that it has the effect of returning to youth.</p>
<p>"Nao Wei" also has the effect of calming nerves and can deeply treat insomnia and restore sleep.</p>
<p>"Nao Wei" is also very effective for children with delayed physical and mental development, addiction to laziness, or nerve seizures.</p>
<p>"Nao Wei" has a great ability to promote blood circulation, so it can immediately treat irregular menstruation and menstrual pain.</p>
<p>"Nao Wei" is made into pills. Take one pill before three meals a day. Children aged 10 to 17 should take half.</p>
<p>"Nao Wei" is sold in the following major pharmacies and Weidan Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory (Room 101, No. 868 Jing'an Temple Road, telephone 36195). The main distributors are listed below:</p>
<p>Bai Bu Yanghang, 17 Guangdong Road</p>

<p>Zhu Aiyue, a dancer at Central Dance Hall, resides in the Jusheng Hotel on the third floor of Lane 405, Junction of Avenue Edward VII and Rue de la Gendarmerie. On the 26th of last month, at midnight, Zhu returned home with a dance client, Wang Dafang (resident of 98 Route Doumer), for a chat. Suddenly, Zhang Mingzheng, the 20-year-old Wuxi owner of the Jusheng Hotel, arrived and demanded that Zhu move out, causing an argument between the two parties. Wang Dafang, seeing this,</p>
<p>Spoke out for Fairness</p>
<p>Argued that the second landlord should not force a tenant to move out late at night and that such unreasonable oppression was inappropriate. Zhang then vented his anger on Wang and immediately went downstairs with his younger brother, Zhang Mingde, and an employee, Qin Rengen, rushing into Zhu's room, grabbing and beating Wang, causing injuries to Wang's chest and other areas. The police brought both parties into the police station. Wang stated the details of the assault, while Zhang Mingzheng claimed that Zhu often brought male clients</p>
<p>To Stay Overnight</p>
<p>And talked and laughed loudly late at night, which not only disturbed the sleep of other tenants, but also, with the police recently investigating household registrations, the issue of dancers bringing guests home was a matter of concern for the second landlord. Therefore, he negotiated with her, but there was no act of violence. The police chief ordered them to leave. Wang Dafang, feeling unwilling to be beaten for no reason, has specially commissioned a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Zhang Mingzheng and his brother on charges of assault. A summons will be issued soon.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Chauffeur Conspires with Gang to Steal Vehicles; Ring Leader Yu Jinfu Arrested <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Since the police authorities, in order to save gasoline, completely suspended the use of privately owned vehicles of non-essential service personnel in the Public Concession, the French Concession, and the Chinese areas, there have been numerous cases of chauffeurs colluding with bandits to steal vehicles. Reports to the police stations have been fruitless, with no trace to be found. The other day, detective Xie Zhiguang of the Route Gordon Police Station received confidential information and arrested Yu Jinfu, a Tongzhou native, at 19 Lane 646, Route Say Zoong, the ringleader specializing in stealing such vehicles. He was dressed in a Western suit and was unusually handsome. This place is the home of Zhang Qinshi, a female relative and fellow villager of his, and is the general headquarters for stealing automobiles. Two Browning six-round automatic pistols were also seized, with police registration licenses F269 and 2714, and were taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, the police station applied for detention in accordance with Articles 76 and 111, and stated that recently, the theft of the above-mentioned automobiles had been endless. They were sold at the lowest prices and transported to other ports. The criminal Yu Jinfu came to Shanghai from Suzhou and happened to go to Zhang Qinshi's house to negotiate the purchase of vehicles to be shipped to the Suzhou area. He was working as a chauffeur in a certain organization, which was undoubtedly a case of divine justice, as he had thrown himself into the net. He gave vague confessions. According to Zhang Qinshi, the two pistols were previously used by her husband and were not used for illegal purposes. The court ordered them to be remanded separately for investigation and verification at a later date.</p>

<p>In recent days, the Shanghai Municipal Council has been actively and tirelessly strengthening the security within the concession. In addition to stepping up the arrest of petty criminals and intensifying defense, it has also successively held terror drills in various districts to allow police officers and self-defense corps members to familiarize themselves with everything. Yesterday afternoon, around 3 p.m., the Chengdu Road Police Station held a terror drill in the Chongqing Road and Dagu Road area within its jurisdiction, which lasted for one hour before it was completed. At that time, traffic on all roads was temporarily interrupted, but the order was exceptionally good.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Talking About Eating with Hu Pu'an <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Talking about eating is a very mundane topic, and what good would come of talking about it? But in today's world, discussing how to eat is truly the only thing people in society talk about. Moreover, what we're discussing here is merely eating, not the people's livelihood, so there shouldn't be any harm in it.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Pu'an suffered a cerebral hemorrhage two years ago, resulting in hemiplegia. When he was ill, I visited him. This old man was truly extraordinary, using books as pillows and reading tirelessly. I thought it wasn't suitable for someone in his condition and tried to dissuade him. More than a year has passed in a flash, and due to my laziness in visiting old friends, I haven't been there even once. Last month, I received a letter from him, which read, "I have long been confined to my home, but fortunately, my mind has not deteriorated, and I can still read." Opening the letter, I couldn't help but feel ashamed. It is equally wrong to not visit someone whom you should visit. But since Pu'an cannot visit others, those who can visit him should do so. If one can visit but doesn't, it would be a breach of duty. Therefore, despite my laziness in visiting friends, I had to summon my courage and visit him at his home.</p>
<p>After two years of quiet recuperation, Pu'an has made significant progress. His illness has subsided by seventy percent, with only his left leg slightly impaired. His long beard is like silver silk, and although it was once shaved, it now flows like that of a celestial being. He had to give up Tai Chi boxing and swordsmanship due to his illness, but his piercing gaze and imposing demeanor still rival Chu Biao from the Shi Gong An stories. Besides reminiscing and chatting, we also discussed the difficulty of the eating problem.</p>
<p>Pu'an said, "With my appetite, no matter how expensive rice becomes, it has little impact." I said that one cannot be compared to you. With your vitality and spirit, you must have a method for maintaining your health. Then, I went on to talk about Pu'an's art of eating.</p>
<p>Pu'an said, "Before the war, I wouldn't stop until I had three bowls of rice per meal. Since the war began, as the price of rice has increased daily, my appetite has gradually decreased. Now, I only eat one bowl of rice per day, which is only about one teacup when poured into one!" It can be inferred that the amount he has saved is not just two-thirds, but actually three-quarters. Yet Pu'an's spirit has not diminished. In fact, his reading and memory have improved. This shows that proper dieting does not harm one's health.</p>
<p>Pu'an has three meals a day, porridge in the morning and evening, and rice at noon, each limited to one small bowl. Although he eats little, he spends a long time chewing. Whether it's porridge or rice, he chews each mouthful until it becomes a thin paste before swallowing. In other words, he not only avoids swallowing whole grains of rice or porridge, but also ensures that any remaining residue is thoroughly mixed with saliva before he considers his meal complete. Therefore, it takes him at least twenty minutes to finish one bowl of rice, ensuring no waste, with every grain entering his stomach to provide nourishment and vitality. Compared to those who eat three or four bowls of rice per meal, he is no less energetic. He writes for seven hours a day without feeling tired, sleeps for four or five hours without feeling it's too little, and writes over 300,000 words a year without feeling it's too much. He still has plenty of energy for socializing and conversation. Eating is not about quantity, but about the quality of chewing. In today's difficult times, his approach is worth emulating.</p>
<p>Moreover, Pu'an's strengths extend beyond this. People who talk about dieting and hygiene often emphasize the need for milk, eggs, fruits, vegetables, fish, and meat, highlighting the fats, proteins, vitamins, iron, phosphorus, and chlorophyll in each. They believe that only by harmonizing these elements can one achieve true nourishment, maintain health, and enjoy longevity. Even if successful, this lifestyle is a luxury. Leaving aside today's high prices, even in the past, it was not easily attainable for the average wealthy person. However, Pu'an's method is simple, practical, and economical. He doesn't find it expensive at all, and many consider it unattainable. Pu'an doesn't emphasize side dishes with each meal. He eats plain porridge or plain rice. After the meal, he only takes a small dish of green vegetables, chewing them carefully, swallowing the essence, and discarding the residue. Besides this, he has no delicacies, nor any milk or eggs. Yet Pu'an doesn't feel any deficiency in his health because of this. On the contrary, his original illness has been gradually recovering. However, Pu'an's success is not only due to his proper dieting but also to his peaceful recuperation. His daily three two-hour sessions of meditation greatly benefit his health and cannot be ignored. It is truly as they say:</p>
<p>Chewing with deep skill,</p>
<p>Every grain brings spirit.</p>
<p>Rice is hard to buy and eat,</p>
<p>Quietly nurture and preserve your nature.</p>
<p>Dieting can prolong life, while overeating can harm it. This applies regardless of whether it's rice, noodles, fish, meat, fruits, or vegetables; the pros and cons are the same. But the world values overeating, whether in health or illness. Food during illness is the most crucial; one mistake can worsen the condition. Although nutrition is essential during illness, diet should still be cautious. In the past, Western medicine didn't emphasize dietary restrictions and even considered them wrong, but now many recognize the importance of avoiding certain foods and moderating others. This shows the inseparable relationship between diet and health. Some who highly value nutrition may consider Pu'an's approach inadequate, and I've had similar thoughts. But Pu'an says otherwise, as long as it's done properly and consistently, a little is harmless, and simplicity doesn't matter. Even with eight hours of work, one doesn't feel tired. It's like soldiers, not in number, but in quality. The essence of quality is not in delicacies but in the quality of chewing, so that every grain has its nourishment and every vegetable has its function. That's all there is to it. Although, for those like Hang Yu and Xie Xu, who expend a lot of energy daily, Pu'an's method may be difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>However, dieting is the most ancient Chinese health practice. Zhang Liang's grain avoidance is one example. Later generations who talked about cultivation and longevity valued it even more. Recently, the results of Miss MacKay's practical experiments also show that maintaining a slight hunger can prolong life, which is consistent with Chinese health practices and the saying, "If you want children to be healthy, keep them slightly hungry and cold." Westerners often criticize Chinese people for eating too much. Indeed, the common view in China only recognizes that food provides nutrition, without considering whether it can be digested and beneficial. Seeing someone who eats heartily, they assume he has found the way to maintain health. Like Xue Rengui in novels, who "settled Tianshan with three arrows, and his soldiers sang as they entered Hangu Pass," people often talk about how big his appetite was, considering it a good thing, but historical records don't mention it. However, during the An Lushan Rebellion, the Tang general Zhang Xing ate a dou of rice and ten jin of meat per meal, wore armor, and wielded a Mo Dao weighing fifty jin. Such a person certainly existed, but ultimately, those with large appetites often suffer from gastrointestinal problems. Pu'an's way of eating porridge and rice can be said to favor the stomach but disadvantage the teeth. By torturing the teeth to turn food into a thin paste, the stomach and intestines can easily absorb it, saving a lot of work. Some say that elderly people's excrement is better fertilizer than that of the young because it's less digested and contains more nitrogen. If everyone digested like Pu'an, wouldn't the fields be disappointed? Nevertheless, Pu'an's way of eating is worth noting in this time of food scarcity. (Liu Tang)</p>
<h3 id="e47">Roses Blooming Everywhere <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>These days, one can see roses in full bloom in quiet courtyards. There is a saying, "Roses bloom everywhere in the fourth month," and this is exactly that time. Roses belong to deciduous shrubs with thorny and dense branches, small oval leaves, and large five-petaled flowers in red, white, yellow, and other colors. When the roses begin to fade, spring is already old, and the greenery darkens as the reds thin out, symbolizing the approach of hot summer.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Save the Deaf-Mute Refugee Children <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The refugee camps have been closed and disbanded. However, there are still hundreds of old, weak, and disabled refugees who cannot be repatriated. These orphans, the elderly, the weak, the young, the insane, and the disabled are all pitiful creatures in the world, who have tasted the bitterness of life. Among them, the most pitiful are the deaf-mute refugee children. They suffer from a double disability. They have ears but cannot hear beautiful music or gentle language. They have mouths but cannot express their will or report their illnesses. From childhood to old age, they are in this painful state, stifling their voices, living in a daze. From an educational standpoint, they are the most promising among the disabled. They possess the necessary conditions for working in life: keen eyes and capable hands. They only need special education to transform from useless, resource-consuming people into useful, productive citizens. Therefore, educating the deaf-mute is a proactive effort, not passive charity. Mrs. Mi of the China Inland Mission, recognizing this, has consulted with the authorities of the Fuya School to find a way to educate and care for them.</p>
<p>The first step has been agreed upon. The Fuya School will send a teacher to the camp for three hours a day. All six deaf-mute students of school age will be provided with books, stationery, and the teacher's transportation expenses by the Fuya School, fulfilling their obligation to mutual assistance. This has been implemented since late April. There are still four young children who will have to wait for another day.</p>
<p>The second step is that educating the deaf-mute will not show immediate results. It must proceed step by step, like educating ordinary children, to advance in order. If they can complete senior primary school, they can communicate with ordinary people through writing and find employment without difficulty. Therefore, the six deaf-mute students urgently need to enter the school for full-day special education. Currently, the cost of living is high, and the school's finances are strained. However, they are willing to plan and manage the education costs completely free of charge. The problem of clothing and food relies on the help of enthusiastic people in society. Therefore, we are appealing on behalf of the deaf-mute refugee children, respectfully calling on philanthropists to open their purses, do good for the deaf-mute, and accumulate immeasurable merit. If you are willing to sponsor the clothing and food expenses of one or more children, please notify the Fuya School. They will immediately contact you to handle the matter. The address of the Fuya School is No. 33, Huayuan Road, Huangjiasha, Carter Road, telephone 32948.</p>

<p>Our newspaper received a letter from Mr. Pu Qiting yesterday, which reads: "Dear Sir, recently, prices have soared, and life has become increasingly difficult. Summer is approaching, and epidemics are bound to be rampant. Poor compatriots are not only worried about their daily necessities but also feel the pain of illness. My wife, Zou Yunyu, and I cannot bear to sit idly by seeing the misery of their groans. Therefore, we sold our clothes and saved from our daily expenses, totaling over a thousand yuan, to purchase five hundred bottles of Xia Yao Shui from the Kefa Pharmacy. We request your newspaper and the Xinwen Bao (250 bottles each) to distribute them on our behalf. Although it is a drop in the bucket, it expresses our concern. I trouble your efforts and wish all colleagues of your newspaper good health. Pu Qiting, May 25th."</p>
<p>The service column notes that we have followed Mr. Pu's wishes and distributed the medicine accordingly, limited to in-person requests, while supplies last. We also thank Mr. Pu.</p>
<p>Donating Injury Medicine. Mr. Wu's residence at No. 11, Zhicheng Lane, near the Siming Hospital on Avenue Haig in the French Concession, has been donating injury medicine to all sectors for over ten years, at considerable expense. In the past, in-person requests were granted without limit. However, due to improper storage, the medicine has lost its effectiveness and harmed patients. Now, due to the exorbitant price of medicine, we are forced to limit each person to one dose, starting from today, to save costs and benefit patients.</p>

<p>The over-the-counter market for public bonds yesterday was still in a buying frenzy, with prices rising sharply. After an initial dip, prices soared, and within 20 minutes, all bonds hit their daily limit. All bonds rose by more than 4 yuan. The rapid rise in prices and the excitement of the market were unseen in recent months. Sellers accounted for less than two-thirds, while buyers were numerous. There were only buyers in the market, with sellers being few. The sluggish atmosphere of the past few months was completely swept away. This shows that the bulls have won, and their strength has surpassed the bears' actual assets. Therefore, the heavy pressure from the bears was ignored by the bulls. With all commodities rising wildly, public bonds could not be an exception, which also proves the direction of the market. The selling volume of Tongli was no less than on Saturday, and the selling volume of Tongkang and Hu Heji was also considerable. The selling of Jinfeng, Zhenhua, and Yongkang Tongyuan, however, was only nominal. Lianyi was the most aggressive buyer, with Chengkang, Runde, Wuhe, Yuanhe, and Hongda also actively absorbing. Yitai, Hongxing, Shuntai, Xinji, Renfeng, Xinhua, Jiufeng, and Hengfu also participated in the buying. Prices opened a little lower by one or two yuan, then rose rapidly, hitting the limit in a straight line, without any setbacks. The situation was excellent. In the current environment, there is no room for small-scale trading. As a result, all bonds rose by 4 yuan and hit their limits. Even after the market closed, there was still considerable buying. The total transaction volume was about 3 million yuan. A summary table is listed below:</p>

<p>Yesterday, the black market for cash Xia Chi saw an astonishing rise in prices, escalating even further. The price has risen to the 40,000 yuan mark, with demand exceeding supply. The market is thriving due to the currency system changes, the wild rise in military notes and cotton yarn, and the sudden influx of buyers from Tianjin. Transactions were brisk. From the morning, each strip (10 taels) of cloth was seen rising to an unprecedented high price of 40,000 yuan amidst unanimous buying, 10,300 yuan higher than the noon closing price last Saturday and 6,000 yuan higher than the afternoon price. The selling of actual goods was from the Jin Hao gang, a certain securities firm, and a certain gang. Military notes once fell back, and the price also dropped by 5,000 yuan, retreating to 35,000 yuan. The Tianjin gang commissioned two securities firms to buy, and even with a 200 yuan discount on a 1,000 yuan head, the price rose by over 1,000 yuan. The noon closing price was 36,300 yuan, 6,600 yuan higher than the noon closing price last Saturday and 2,000 yuan higher than the afternoon price.

US dollar notes rose to 50 yuan, and Hong Kong notes also rose to 7.5 yuan. Military notes opened at 13.4 yuan in the morning, rose to 13.7 yuan, then fell slightly to 11.7 yuan, and finally closed at 12 yuan, all head-discount prices, a sharp increase of 2.7 yuan compared to last week.

<p>The cotton yarn market followed the fluctuations of the currency and tended to rise, but actual transactions remained sluggish as usual.

<h3 id="e59">Green Woolen Fabrics Almost Completely Bought Up <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The woolen fabric market was affected by the high prices of military notes and Central Reserve Certificates. Market sentiment was unusually strong, with actual sales lacking and continued reduction of forward contracts. The market trended firm. Autumn and winter goods were particularly tight. The grass green color of Huate woolen fabric, riding breeches, and thick and thin serge fabrics saw even sharper price increases in recent days. Yihai No. 1 to 28 riding breeches sold for 280 yuan per yard, Yinfeng brand at 265-266 yuan, Caishen Tiger grass green Huate woolen fabric sold for 250 yuan, Dalong Yangcheng brand at 215 yuan, and Yangcheng serge at 160 yuan. Yinfeng serge was at 185 yuan. A large portion had been almost completely bought up by a certain party. The factory determined that they would not be able to produce more of the grass green color because the dye had been discontinued, so it was certain that it would disappear. As a result, the limited inventory currently circulating in the market was being hoarded, leading to unusual speculation.</p>
