<h3>南美對參戰　意見不一</h3>

<h3>日方採取重要措施　經濟局勢改觀　改選總醫理　接管工廠清理銀行食糧燃料及失業問題待努力</h3>

<p>上週中第一頃　動、爲工部局英美荷四外董之　職、東京方面　已認爲容許與日交戰國國民留任工部局內實與時局相矛盾、於是日方即要求彼等退職、同時尙有無數反軸心國人員、退出工部局之各委員會、工部局內其餘各董、遂選日董岡崎繼李德爾氏爲總董、繼續辦理局務、而對於所留缺職、則暫時不擬選人充任　現工部局內計有日董三名、華董六名、瑞士董事一名、及德董一名、不在本埠之英董一名、美董兩名、則不計在內、至於工部局上　職員之調動、是否亦在考慮、則尙不能確言、</p>

<p>食糧燃料　待接濟</p>
<p>至於木埠華商業務、則日方未採任何措施、華商銀行業務方面則滙　銀行之地位、已由半官性之正金銀行取代、華商工廠之太多數仍繼續工作、惟無數堆棧則猶被封閉中　整個上海未來之大問題、則爲食糧燃料之外來接濟、與新起之工人失業問題、此等問題之圓滿解決、尙待吾人之共同努力也、</p>

<h3>唐蔚芝先生　讀文聽講記</h3>
<p>— 眞金</p>
<p>太倉唐蔚芝先生楚當代大儒，手創無錫國學專修學校，提倡　學，不遺餘力。筆者久仰唐老先生學問德行的高超，尤其愛慕他對於讀國文的方法。前日在該校公開演講讀文法，機會難得，於是趨車欣然而往。一方面藉此得瞻丰采，方面更可親聆他讀文的聲調，無怪慕名而往者粉至咨來。離開演講時間，還有三刻鐘，小小的禮堂，早已塞得滿坑滿谷了。鐘鳴十下，始見唐老先生爲人扶持而來，白鬚飄然，步屨坦坦一，在人叢中走向講臺去，聽講者都起立致敬，并報以熱烈的掌聲，他老人家含著微笑點頭頻頻。上了講　，既坐定，空氣肅穆得連一聲咳嗽的聲音都沒有，個個人備諦聽他的宏論。</p>
<p>此次他讀的文章，共有四篇，依照曾文正公手定分爲太陽·少陽·太陰·少陰四類，各舉一例：太陽氣勢的舉生過秦論，少陽趣味的舉范希文岳陽樓記，太陰識度的舉韓退之送奎歸盤谷序，少陰情韻的舉歐陽永叔五代史伶官傳序。所謂太陽氣勢是含有一種噴薄跌宕之勞，少陽趣味是含有一種詼諧閒適之趣，所謂太陰議度是含有一種閎拈含蓄之度，少陰情韻含有一種沉雄悽測之韻。所以在唐老先生讀來是各有千秋的了。關於這讀文的方法，既定於曾文正，傳之於桐城吳擎甫，唐老先生就楚受業於吳擊甫的，一脈相仍，彌覺珍貴。現在他變目失明，年事又高，我們眞有點後繼不知何人的感嘆。</p>
<p>他在未讀文之前先說明作文章的要這，他就　出必須心　純正，從養性養氣着手，這眞是一針見血之談。我們想一個卑汚奸惡的人，怎能寫出萬世不朽的文章呢？即使寫出來的，也不過是替主子歌功頌德，爲奴才吹牛拍馬，有誰去柏信他們？我們看此番選謾范希文的岳陽樓記中「先天下之憂而瞎，後天下之樂而業」；歐陽永叔的伶官傳序中「憂勞可以興國，　象可以亡身」；膚老先生用懇擊熱情的聲調，朗朗而誦，不禁使我們沉浸在一般　然正氣之中。</p>
<p>唐老先生讀賣生過案踰，因爲是太陽氣勢，音調是這樣擊偉，理掙琮琮，讀至激昂高揚之處，令人指髪；接　岳陽樓記，少陽趣味，就覺得擊不失雄偉，却沒有太陽之文的剛强了，聽了似乎吃了一支雪茄，　了幾杯醇酒那麼興奮。到要讀第三爲送李愿歸盤谷序，他老先生似乎已經精力不機，呷了口開水，命旁站的一位先生代讀了，讀來雖也能疾徐中節，總覺得好像失之於急躁，沒有唐老先生的實宏，發自丹出之氣。最後的伶官傳序，唐老先生再接再區，賈其餘男，贖來是一唱三嘆，少陰之文，以委婉舒徐的音　出之，眞是絕　。最後他更抄一段讀文要　，作爲結束：「凡讀文每篇以三十暹爲度，先十遍學鍊氣法，次十遍觀佈局用意法，次十遍研選辭法·讀文抑揚遲速，既得門徑，則作文進步自然迅速。」</p>
<p>散會，見扶老携幼，名士淑媛，相繼離去，筆者也帶着滿足的心情，踏上歸途，總計聽衆不下五百人，這盛况正是顯出大家對國學的重視，不負店老先生一番提創之意了。</p>

<h3>「返鄉運動」</h3>
<p>— 金毅</p>
<p>西藥廣告，獨多補藥，不是藥力「而面俱到」，便是「有意想不到之效力」，這或許是「科學進步」，或許是對準國人之「體弱多病」而發。但是有錢人還是醉心於吉林人參與上等官燕，一冬之需，動輒千金；即使退而求其次，也要開一料膏滋藥，或者是驢皮阿膠之類，三元幾角半介侖的淸魚肝油，是祇有「窮而後工」的朋友揑緊鼻子曣下去，作爲酬答一年胼手胝足之勞。直到近年，才是風氣大變，賜保命銷路奇佾，維他維多名目繁多，既腥自膩的魚肝油亦貴至每磅三四十元（從前祇有幾角大洋），其漲價的倍數，遠在衣食（米）住行之上，其理由是舶來品均以金磅美金訐算，如按照每日掛牌，「這個價錢還買不到」也。——這是二三個月前各藥房夥計的「口頭語」。其實呢，鉛版和銅皮，蜂蜜絨綫興力克奶粉，阿摩尼亞及淸魚肝油，甚至白糖火柴，都放在棧房裏（擱樓上也有）按兵小動，其口號是「放一天賺一天，賣一樣蝕一樣」，於是愈無貨應市，愈拼命收買。如果眞眞不幸而生病，病而又非某種特效藥不可的，則是堆足了鈔票還要求人請託才能「讓」到手呢！然而好景不常」，「廉價出讓」之不足，還須聲明「即日返鄉，挑帶不便」，（你讀過分類廣告的「出售攔嗎？）　便宜貨果然是時候，不過有餘錢進補的朋友自己也是「家藏甚富」，沒有錢買米的却已更「提早返鄉」了！</p>
<h3>臉譜</h3>
<p>— 倪明</p>
<p>舊劇臉譜，不可計數，梨園行中，向無一定成法可資按鑒，全憑口傳心記，所記者單純祇需某一臉譜之大體式樣（如三塊瓦碎臉或亂臉等）及色澤，如是縱多至無數，亦不難成竹在胸。至一臉之細微式色，司由勾者隨心而化，初無一定標準。凈行巾對之有研求者，不持能切合象　意，抑能令觀衆眉飛色舞，此雖小道，亦足添助顧曲者之興致也。</p>
<p>按臉部所有額眉眼鼻口　各部式色之創，均寓有象　作用，如實爾墩之公明兩　之金錢，意即財神之特徵，諸如此類主要之點，不能任意改動，然亦稍有變通者，如竇之紅眉上加一細絛黃色，蓋意在加重實雄威有如虎也。再加　陽樓中之徐十英，普通皆知係綠色碎臉，嘗見武凈張連廷所勾者，除額，鼻，下　外，其兩頰所抹，並非如普通之綠色，而爲粉紅色，兩肩爲十分花哨之黑白色，蓋徐於　陽樓劇中正屬少年公子，兩頰自應粉紅爲是，倘興白水灘中同抺兩　皆綠，則無從軒輊其於兩劇中屬於兩種身份地位。至兩眉之花檐，因其年靑時之暴躁，固應勝於後來在白水灘通天　中者也。由此而觀，勾者須對劇中人身份地位性格及特殊容相，有深切之體會，始能神而化之。</p>
<p>一臉既成，近看如此，遠視則另有感覺；近看祇判色澤勻潔，綫條分明，然不能領略其容相神情顯露至何種程度；遠視則反之。例如　飛之笑容及高登之兇形，近看者殆有呆板之感，惟視始感一笑一兇，是否奕奕生動。笑之顯露在於兩頰，兇則在於兩眉，勾者除需會心勾劃外，尙須出以簡潔，始收遠近官視之效。</p>
<p>舍凈行外，當今不乏勾臉能手，武生高盛麟即其一也。盛麟愛好此道，且能鎔冶各家各譜於一鑪，故其諸勾臉武戲夕臉，如七郎高登等，形威出衆，獨具風　者，非偶然也。</p>
<h3>「鐵血奸雄」</h3>
<p>「鐵血奸雄」的英文名字是　Dark　Qommand，　意思是「黑暗命令」，顧名思義就可猜想到當時法令的紊亂與黑暗，這裏所講的人物是美國南北戰爭史上有名的奸雄，他興仁義之師，作盜賊之行，在南軍戰區中打着北軍的旗幟，放火焚燒，屠城洗刦；反之，在北軍戰區中又打着南軍的旗幟，幹着同樣的勾當。像這樣的一個人物，貫串着一段纏綿的情史，劇本方面已有了挺好的素材總儘够迷人，加着導演洗鍊的手法，那有不十全十美的道理。提起這位導演，却楚大大的有名，就是那位「戰地　聲」「卡門「月宮寶盦的大導演勞兩華爾許氏，共和影片公司花了一筆大本錢才把這位導演聘請得來，祖任這艱巨的工作。</p>
<h3>別矣，生煎饅頭！</h3>
<p>— 斯華</p>
<p>早餐或進點，沙利文固是大好去處，然一般措大與從事節約者，難免覺得望門生畏，稍稍富麗一些，亦不過上四如春，五芳齋，來一客湯包或燒買，平日終楚以生煎饅頭或蟹壳黃了事，成爲一般人的家常美點。時至今日，工部局以麵粉供應不易，諭知餅饅業同業公會，即日起停製一切非平民必需食品，儘量焙製大餅大饅頭，否則停止供給麵粉，吊銷營業執照。是則生煎饅頭，蟹　黃以及類似的比較「粗中帶細」的餅饅皆在禁製之例。</p>
<p>時常在沿大陸商塲一帶見到大餅攤畔竚立着成羣的女學生，服飾都　，而在等待生煎饅頭的出籠，看情形，她們似以之當爲一頓美滿的午餐的，有的以報紙包紥，有的則當路而嚼，亦頗能使人見了　涎欲滴。</p>
<p>平日買點心，以加倍價錢，定製蟹壳黃，因油酥及　子的增加，味目較美，用熱開水佐食，足使儕輩不勝　羨，而爭相效尤。而今因生煎饅頭，蟹壳黃以及類似的食品之被禁製供，吾人將無復再有此差堪告慰的口腹，而祗得學北方人以高脚饅頭或大餅充點了。</p>
<p>因大餅而想到油條，油條兼有油與麵粉的消耗，但並未被禁製，的是幸事，吃大餅和粢飯，有油條爲　，就如錦上添花，現在既尙有供應，美中不足之感是可以暫時避免的了，因對生煎饅頭表示惜別，附帶贊美和挽留油條一下。</p>
<h3>李綺年病</h3>
<p>李綺年自完成馬徐維邦導演的「現代青年」後，即從事於新片「賊美人」的攝製工作，該片差不多已成十之六七，不久便可攝竣。自本月八日起，她因受寒以及工作疲勞，竟然病倒，攝片工作因而停頓，據悉昨日體溫增至一百零二度，現由名醫二位在會診中。　華當局已允給假半月至一月，籍資休養。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦鷗</p>
<p>十六　青春之火</p>
<p>他每次在舞塲裹看到那些腰細得像水蛇一樣，眼媚得像千年狐狸一樣的舞女時，心也未嘗不上上下下的狂跳着，但那祇是一種慾慾，當他一走出無塲的大門，吸到了一口新鮮空氣之後，心便立刻寗靜了。</p>
<p>「這是一種酖，瓶上標得很淸楚，怎麼可以不顧一切的喝下去呢？「他往往這樣自己警戒着。</p>
<p>但他一瞧見梅寳，却就覺得這決不楚一瓶毒酒了。　她的　素的服裝，天然秀麗的面貌，溫文並莊重的舉止，沒有一點小使少華心醉的，如果要把她譬做酒的話，那末除掉眞正的法蘭西香檳便沒有別的可以比擬了！</p>
<p>最奇怪的是他覺得這一個賣唱的女孩何以很爲幾分像他自己家裏的姑媽？</p>
<p>然而他回家之後，當然不敢就向湘綺說，只在暗地裏特別多看了她幾眼，結果是越看越像。於是他心裹便覺得格外的興奮了。</p>
<p>他記得很淸楚，父親曾經在閑談的時候說過幾次，他姑媽是從前天津女子師範的一朶校花，長得又好看，讀書又聰明，眞小知道有多少人追求她；最後爲了要救他父親的癆病起見，看在錢的份上，才嫁了一位軍閥，後來幾乎個個人都替她婉借。</p>
<p>「假使我能够得到一個長得像姑媽一樣好看的女子做終身伴侶，爸爸跟媽媽眞不知道要怎樣歡喜呢，而姑媽也必然免不掉要蘇一大跳，她做夢也不會想到天下有長得跟她如此相像的人！」打壽榮華菜館裹回來的一晚，少華足足在枕上胡思亂想的鬧了半夜。（三〇一）</p>
<h3>為買米而呼籲</h3>
<p>— 平野</p>
<p>調整上海糧食的困難，是事實，工部局和法租界當局爲市民解除民食的困難，也是事實；而買米的困難，也是事實，這個民食的問題，大衆所懺以托命的問題，雖然大家都談得够了，慨嘆得够了，還是沒有　够解決這個困難，當然這個困難，是多方面的，需要大衆共同合作，共同解決。</p>
<p>在這裹我們相信如果租界當局過去不注重這個問題，上海的民食，或已發生不堪設想的情形，今日市面的安定，還不致使市民成爲餓爭，還是租界當局維持之功。</p>
<p>買米者幾乎天天在戰餓綫上掙扎。一早起來，既不知道那一家米店今天開門，茫茫然去木立株守着，日上三竿，還是沒有開門的話就得在懊喪地奔競到另米店，幸而這一家開着門，如獲至實的匍匐排列，這一羣同屬可憐的買米者，有的孔武有力，有的與店員相熱，有的能够獲得便利，「同是今日買米人，相逢何必爭先後」？然而維都熱望以一切的力量，易此三升，可是守秩序者和老弱婦孺們，落後是必然的，失望楚當然的；回到家裏，烟火是耍等米到才舉的，如今買米不到，祇得勉撑飢腸，稍理雜務，懷着）半失望的心緒，再到米店，眼見兩面卜千號的買米者，還是幾個孔武有力者在前面，自己當然要列在最後，冀獲倖於萬一，結果或者「今日洋米售完」的牌子一掛，還是偸偷的拭淚回去，於楚闔家服毒不及施救的新聞，有的見諸報載，有的爲篇福所限，未曾刋出。</p>
<p>在租界當局努力調劑民食的今日，大衆的期望，是嚴格依照號碼售米，將每一米店的常日售米量分配給　買者應爲多少號，後來的不予列號，免得前推後擁，徒然影響秩序，同時也免得購米者費時誤事。對於擠購洋米，轉售者和一天連續　米幾次者，加以調查處分。如果還有最詳　的辦法，那是更好，這些哀嗚，自然尤其希望買米大衆之中，能够各人自愛！</p>

<p>家庭</p>
<h3>節約第一</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>在目前要談到的家庭問題，比以前更多，但這些問題，並不是起居室應該怎樣裝飾，鴨絨被應該怎樣購買，和宴客應該用些什麼酒。而應以節約爲前提。以我們平常所可以想到的，有下列的幾點，就是目前立刻就該實行的。</p>
<p>一夫一妻的家庭，組織自然最是簡單，這時候，可以酌定一個節約的新預算，把日用的一切，加以减省。如果楚有兄弟姑嫂合居在一起的家庭中，這時候更應該合作起來，不要再讓那些妯娌之間時常存在的惡感繼續生存本來生二雙煤爐的，可以合生一隻，本來分開吃飯的，可以合在一起吃，本來各有傭婦的，就可以辭退一二個。即便是洗衣，也可以利用皂水合在一起多洗幾件衣裳。每一個地方能　節省一點，積貯起來也可以使負擔減輕。</p>
<p>同時，對於菜肴的選擇，也是値得注意的，有許多價廉的蔬菜，具有豐富的維他命成分，反比貴價的鷄鴨魚肉來得有益身體落得便宜。</p>
<p>在電力的限制下，我們就不妨早起早睡，向來點夜火的，可以根本不點。向來點用四十瓦特的燈泡的，可以換上二十五瓦特的燈泡。而早起對於家庭中每一個人都便利不少，要做的工作，清晨起身，可以應付更為　如，而每天早陲可以廢除一般家庭中每天非吃不可的點心。</p>
<p>在比較經　寬裕的家庭裏，有得大家聚賭的精神，何不去做一些有益的消遣。把舊的衣服翻新，把舊的絨線衫重新編結起來，這些工作，也等待着主婦們去做。做丈夫的，也可以在家裹多看幾冊書。即使每大上公事房去，如果路並不極遠，可以早些起身，或者坐一段車子，再步行一段，既可省下　些中資，身體也因此可以得到相當的運動。</p>
<p>家庭生活的美滿，並小是全在於物質方面的，精神方面。也許更來得重要。如果每一個家庭，能够大家合作起來，在節約的條件下，改善家庭半活，那末，要享受　滿的家庭生活，在任何時候並不楚不可能的。</p>
<h3>西班牙劇作家的感想</h3>
<p>— 思</p>
<p>西班牙的劇作家，兵士兼大情人諾泊第凡加是一個戰劇界的超人，生於一五六二年十一月二十五日，在宋春舫論劇第一集裹，曾稱他爲一個　無古人，後無來者的劇作家，因爲在他的一生之中，曾留下了驚人數量的著作，即使喜劇一種，也有一千八百本之多，其他的作品，書簡等等，尙不在內。</p>
<p>當他生平，會經說過道樣的幾句話。。「在我的花園中有一些花，有半打的圖　和幾冊書，我的生活，就不再有什麼奢望了。」在摘錄這幾句話的人，曾經指爲他在飽嘗人生經騐後的成熟的智慧。</p>
<p>自然，這幾句話，表面上並沒有什麼破綻，然而我們仔細分析一下，就要奇怪，爲什麼他不說，有一個賢德的妻子，或者有一個美滿的家庭呢，這裹面實在有一種理由。</p>
<p>因爲在他的一生之中，雖則著作很忙，然而他和婦女往來的時機很多，不時的和女子往來，擁有許多的悄人，雖則在結婚以後，還是不能愛情專注在他的妻子那裹，因此他到了年齡較大的時期，就不再感受到家庭生活的可貴，而只希望在花園裹看看書，作爲他優逰歲月的方法了。</p>
<p>然而世界上沒有一個人不想有美滿的家庭生活的，如果一個男子或一個女子要厭惡他的家庭生活，他的家庭，一定有什麼缺點。有許多人的情愛不能專一，自然對於家庭生活不能努力改進，而結果他們大都是痛苦的。現代的夫婦，絕對地應該遵守性的道　，諾泊第凡加的天才是値得欽慕的，但他的打爲，並不是我們的好榜樣。</p>

<p>我的家庭問題</p>
<h3>徾文揭曉之十四　誰養我？</h3>
<p>— 惠</p>
<p>結婚後，一眨眼便是三十年，緣　上染了稀疏的銀白，面孔上也添了區區乾枯的皺紋，老了，不可否認的事實！四男三女的撫養成人，便是老的成績。</p>
<p>這四男三女中，我所親生的有三男二女，其餘的是前娘養的（因我是填房），他們都長大成人了，最小的一個也上了二十歲，他們都娶了親，或者出了嫁，各自成立了一個小家庭，所留下的，祗是孤苦無依的我。</p>
<p>「養兒防老，積榖防飢」的迷夢，不打自破了。我住着丈夫僅遣的住房，穿着嫁時改翻的舊衣，但我却沒有得吃和其他的生活費用，我小知道誰該來一養我？</p>
<p>假使我早知今日的話，我當初就不該出嫁，嫁後也不該養育如此多的兒女或者狠心些，把這班兒女一齊送進育嬰堂，免得我多此一重負擔，所省下的一筆撫養敎育費，足够我再坐吃三十年，我又愁什麼？我又何樂而不爲呢！</p>
<p>我不能一味責備我的兒女，因爲他們的確也各有苦衷：兒子們賺的錢不够養他的老婆；女兒們根本不能生產，吊着她們的丈夫吃的，也沒有餘錢來貼我。而且子女們都有一種心理，就是「我該爲我的兒女打算打算啊！娘不是我一個人的，讓別人養好了」。這種思想錯誤嗎？我不知道；不過我相信他們將遭逢到和我一樣的老境，他們的兒女將對待他們，和他們對待我的手段一樣。</p>
<p>不錯，撫育子女楚做父母的天職，然而奉養雙親楚不是做兒女的義務呢？我也知道把兒女當作一己的財產是自私的，他們是社會的產物，但不知道社會對我該怎樣？</p>
<p>編者按：無論那一種制度，在新舊交替的過渡時代，終不免有許多犧牲者，家庭制度的轉變，自然也不能例外。一般守舊的父母（如「家」中的高老太爺等。）迷着做五代同堂的夢，而感覺不到大家庭的不能再存在。一般年靑無智的夫婦，又誤解以爲一個小家庭中，要產生幸福，決不容有尊長存在。因此，在不新不舊的家庭中，就產生了許多的悲劇。像惠太太的情形，就成爲這個過渡時期的犧牲者了。我以爲無論什麼事，都不能絕對，尤其是在家庭裏，因為家庭的健全，完全在於台作，諒解，如果有一點偏見存在，就不能造成一個美滿的家庭。惠太太既然在不能在指定的某家去生活的情形之下，最好還是輪流着在各家生活，或是由各家出一點津貼的費用，不論多寡，量力而行，在這別無辦法之中，只得向自己的子女，開一個談判。決不能讓四男三女各自不負責仟地不問不聞。同時惠太太也得顧到目前的生活負担，即使生活在某一個子女的家裏，也不能想着早福的念頭，而要給他們一點工作上的幫助的，既然能殼寫這一篇微文，或者可以幫着去敎育扶養他們的子女。</p>
<p>我很希望未來的父母，不要再存「養兒防老的念頭，而年靑的夫婦，也不要太不負責任，彼此推諉，一切事情都姿相當時問去準備的，尤其是我國複雜錯綜的家庭問題，値得大家來討論，爲未來的家庭，羹下鞏固的基石。</p>

<h3>Intense Fighting Unfolds in Malaya; Japanese Troops Advance to the Outskirts of Kuala Lumpur</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Domei News Agency Dispatch) – News has arrived from London, Berlin, and Shanghai that Japanese troops occupied Kuala Lumpur last night. However, as of late tonight, this has not been confirmed by the Japanese General Headquarters. Recent military dispatches from the front lines indicate that Japanese troops today launched a fierce attack on the British defense line, which stretches for ten kilometers from east to west, north of Kuala Lumpur. One unit of the Japanese army had already reached the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur by noon. Japanese aircraft also bombed the city, setting military targets ablaze. An official announcement from Tokyo stated that the Japanese vanguard, with close cooperation from aircraft, launched a major flanking attack on Kuala Lumpur, reaching Molek (45 kilometers southwest of Kuala Lumpur) and Klang (25 kilometers west of Kuala Lumpur). Japanese aircraft destroyed 23 British trucks and 7 tanks in a certain area north of Kuala Lumpur, and also destroyed two trains fully loaded with soldiers in the area of Kajang, 11 kilometers southeast of Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a telegram from the Malayan front reports that British forces have abandoned the defense of Kuala Lumpur. Previous expectations that Japanese forces would launch a direct attack from the north did not materialize. The elite Japanese troops, after occupying an important British airfield approximately kilometers southwest of Kuala Lumpur, immediately launched their first attack on the city from the southwest.</p>
<p>Singapore, 11th (Reuters Dispatch) – The British Far East Command announced this morning, stating that there were no changes to report in the Malayan front situation today. Japanese aircraft attacked targets within Malaya yesterday, and the Pontian railway was bombed, damaging the tracks. Muar was also attacked this morning, but detailed reports of casualties and damage have not yet been received. An alert was issued in Singapore this morning, but no bombs were dropped. British aircraft from the Far East Command engaged in patrol and reconnaissance activities throughout yesterday.</p>
<p>Xi'an, 11th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch) – According to news received here today, Singapore is preparing to be besieged. The Japanese troops, undeterred by the heat of the tropical jungle or the rugged terrain, have now occupied Kuala Lumpur, the second largest city in Malaya and the capital of Selangor, and are pursuing the retreating British forces. All docks, warehouses, and military camps in Singapore have been equipped with machine guns and small artillery. Some areas are off-limits to the public, and after sunset, the entire city is as silent as death, with everyone locked in their homes. Currently, the British military authorities are quite busy dealing with the large numbers of people fleeing from the north into Singapore. The food supply problem is already very serious, and all rice stored at the evening twilight has been confiscated and transported to Singapore. According to American sources, the fall of Kuala Lumpur has caused great confusion in the British lines in Malaya. In some war zones, ranging from twenty to fifty kilometers deep, fierce hand-to-hand combat has occurred. The Japanese army's unconventional tactics have left the British at a loss.</p>
<p>London, 11th (Reuters) – According to military observers, fierce fighting is taking place between British and Japanese forces in central Malaya. From that area southwards to the Bernam and Slim Rivers, the British forces are holding the peninsula's strongest natural defenses. The area is characterized by numerous springs and dense jungles, with undulating mountains and narrow defense lines. The artillery can inflict severe blows on the attackers. However, Japanese troops are arriving continuously, wave after wave. If the defending forces are not reinforced, it may be difficult to hold the line under such intense pressure, as the Japanese are able to continually bring in reinforcements. The defending forces are outnumbered and their strength is waning. Thus, the Japanese forces are constantly launching converging attacks from multiple directions, making defense difficult. According to units retreating from the front lines, they are simultaneously threatened from five or six directions, with bullets flying all around. The front lines desperately need more aircraft.</p>
<p>British Forces Implement Scorched Earth Policy</p>
<p>Singapore, 11th (Reuters Dispatch) – A traveler from Kuala Lumpur claimed yesterday, the 11th, that Selangor is now implementing a scorched earth policy. For example, the "Malay Mail," published in Kuala Lumpur by the British for 46 years, ceased publication on January 7th and completely destroyed its printing house the following day. Similarly, tin mines have been flooded and the stored rubber has been burned.</p>
<p>Singapore, 11th (Reuters Dispatch) – General Percival, commander of British forces in Malaya, broadcast from Singapore yesterday, stating briefly that the British are determined to defend Singapore. Britain's mission is to ward off Japan's first blow. Singapore is an area the Allied nations have decided to defend. Percival also warned that Singapore will suffer even more severe air raids than experienced so far.</p>
<p>Australian Air Force Reinforces the Dutch East Indies</p>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Domei News Agency Dispatch) – British and American newspapers speculate that Allied forces are now preparing to attack Japan from Burma, and the fact that American lend-lease supplies to Chongqing will be rerouted to Rangoon at the end of January serves as evidence for this plan. It is also reported that British and American mechanized warfare technical experts are in Rangoon for organizational matters. According to News, Australian pilots and aircraft will be immediately dispatched to reinforce the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Continuously Reinforced; Philippine Battle Situation Chaotic; American and Filipino Forces Defend Bataan Peninsula Relying on Perilous Terrain</h3>
<p>Washington, 11th (Reuters Dispatch) – A War Department communiqué last night stated that on Luzon Island in the Philippines, only skirmishes and artillery fire occurred throughout the day last Friday. Japanese reinforcements are still arriving continuously. Japanese aircraft are limited to reconnaissance. Several Japanese ships appeared again near the coast of Mindanao Island last Friday.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Telegraph Dispatch) – According to a telegraph dispatch from Washington, the battle line is now unfolding in the southwest of Pampanga, near the neck of the Bataan Peninsula, stretching for fifty to sixty kilometers. The American and Filipino forces are showing signs of being forced to retreat. A statement released by the U.S. War Department also acknowledges that the battle situation is chaotic, stating that it is unclear whether the ports of Subic and Olongapo in Subic Bay, located between the Bataan Peninsula and Zambales province on the southwest coast of the Philippines, are still in the hands of American and Filipino forces. The last stand of the American and Filipino forces relies on the approximately twenty-kilometer neck of the Bataan Peninsula, the gateway to the peninsula, formed by the Cabusilan Mountains, which run south from Zambales province, and the swamps at the mouth of the Pampanga River. If this point is breached, the fate of the Bataan Peninsula will be decided.</p>
<h3>Argentina and Peru Sign Commercial Agreement</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 10th (Havas News Agency Dispatch) – It was officially announced that a commercial agreement between Argentina and Peru was signed and concluded today.</p>
<h3>Australian Commonwealth Divides into Two Major Military Districts; Blamey and Sturdee Appointed Commanders; Troops May Be Sent Overseas When Necessary</h3>
<p>Melbourne, 11th (Reuters Dispatch) – Australian Army Minister Ford announced today that Australia has been divided into two major military commands. Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, and South Australia will be under the command of Major General Mackay, the current Commander of the Home Guard. Western Australia will be under the command of Major General Sturdee, recently recalled from the Middle East. Darwin and New Guinea will remain under the command of their local commanders but will be controlled by the Army Headquarters. The Australian government is currently planning to amend the Defense Act to allow the militia to be sent outside of Australia. However, in times of necessity, the militia can be immediately dispatched to key locations outside of Australia, and the law will be amended quickly. The government believes that in the current situation, it is not necessary to take actions that would cause political disruption and hinder the smooth operation of the government.</p>
<h3>Rabaul Area Suffers Air Raids</h3>

<h3>British Parliament Reconvenes to Review Far East Battle Situation; Parliamentarians Express Dissatisfaction with Government Measures; Duff Cooper's Merits and Demerits Await Answers</h3>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 10th (Havas News Agency Dispatch) – A correspondent from the Basel News in London reports that both houses of the British Parliament recently reconvened, and parliamentarians expressed dissatisfaction. Lord Privy Seal Attlee, representing Prime Minister Churchill, failed to provide a detailed report on the battle situation, particularly regarding the question of whether the British land, sea, and air forces in the Far East had done their utmost in the recent war in Malaya, a matter of great concern to parliamentarians. However, it is expected that Prime Minister Churchill will return from Washington for the next meeting of both houses and report on the concrete results obtained from his talks with the United States. Therefore, British political circles anticipate that the government will issue an important declaration after Prime Minister Churchill returns. At that time, Prime Minister Churchill, with the help of another cabinet member, will answer questions frequently raised by parliamentarians regarding the current war. It is expected to take at least two days.</p>
<p>London, 10th (Havas News Agency Dispatch) – Reuters recently reported that members of both houses of Parliament have expressed dissatisfaction with the government's handling of the Pacific War situation. When the next parliamentary session reconvenes, various questions will likely be raised regarding the government's actions in Malaya, similar to what happened after the battles of Narvik and Crete. Therefore, the upcoming debate in the House of Commons is very important and will likely last several days. Duff Cooper, the British cabinet member stationed in Singapore and former Minister of Information, will be summoned back to report on his experiences. Prime Minister Churchill will also participate in the debate. It is anticipated that members of both houses will raise for discussion the criticisms made by the Australian Commonwealth government regarding British errors in the Malayan campaign. According to parliamentary custom, such inquiries often lead to resignations of those responsible. Prime Minister Churchill may declare that he and his cabinet bear collective responsibility, which could lead to a cabinet crisis. However, observers of the political scene in London generally believe that there is no one else capable of leading Britain, as the world generally recognizes Prime Minister Churchill as the most suitable leader for Britain. When Lord Privy Seal Attlee, representing the Prime Minister, reported the situation to the House of Commons, he failed to provide a detailed explanation of the Malayan campaign. Several important points remained unclear, causing great anxiety among members of both houses. Foreign Secretary Eden, in view of the widespread dissatisfaction, has agreed to provide a detailed report. Furthermore, regarding the sinking of the British battleship "Prince of Wales" and the destroyer "Repulse" by Japanese aircraft, the government has already explained to both houses, but parliamentarians still do not find it satisfactory and continue to demand that the government explain why these two battleships were not given adequate air cover. Why did the British Air Force not act when the Japanese launched a surprise attack on December 8th? Why did the British command fail to destroy all military targets within the evacuation zone, and why were large quantities of raw materials and military supplies left to the Japanese? These are all issues that members of both houses want to know. Political figures say that members of both houses believe that the government's handling of the Malayan situation, both before and after the outbreak of the Pacific War, was mishandled. During recent discussions in both houses, several members demanded that the government explain the merits and demerits of Duff Cooper, but so far, the government has not responded.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 10th (Havas News Agency Dispatch) According to news from London, some members of the British Parliament have proposed the immediate establishment of an Imperial War Cabinet. They believe this is necessary to solidify the unity of the Empire and to eliminate the painful impression caused by the Australian Commonwealth's appeal to the United States. The Daily Telegraph also carried a dispatch from its correspondent in London, stating that all sectors here consider it extremely necessary to maintain imperial unity, especially to maintain close ties with the Australian Commonwealth and the New Zealand Dominion. The proposal to establish an Imperial War Cabinet does not arise solely from the recent outbreak of the Pacific War; it is also necessary to take this step in order to combine the economic and other resources of the various parts of the British Empire. So far, the British government has not opposed this proposal and has expressed its approval. However, there are some difficulties in adopting this measure, which is unprecedented in British history. Canada and the Union of South Africa may express dissent, for example. Furthermore, once Prime Minister Churchill returns from Washington, it is hoped that he will establish an Allied Political Committee, whose main task will be to engage in "political warfare." Its scope of activity should not be limited to the various parts of the Empire but should be parallel to the Allied Military Committee, with its mission being to coordinate the political activities of the Allied nations.</p>

<h3>Good Results from Trial Land Declaration in Hubei Province; Cultivated Land in Xianfeng County Increased Threefold Compared to Original Taxable Area; Tax Rate Halved, Total Revenue Increased by Onefold</h3>
<p>Enshi, 11th (Telegraph Dispatch) Hubei Province, in order to implement the land valuation tax scheme after land declaration, first selected Xianfeng County for trial implementation last year. The method focused on guiding the people to automatically conduct a land survey and establish standard land prices, and guiding the people to declare their land. This was completed last winter. The total area of cultivated land in the county exceeded the original taxable area by more than threefold.

The tax amount increased by more than onefold compared to the original land tax. It was launched on December 1 last year. Urban land is still taxed in legal currency, and agricultural land is taxed in kind. The county's land registry is clear, and land values have been fixed. The people are sincerely willing to comply, and tax payments in the past month have been very enthusiastic. Since the promotion of land declaration in our country, this county has completed the land survey by using the method of land declaration, levying taxes based on value, and realizing the preliminary work of equal land rights in the teachings of the founding father of the republic Sun Yat-Sen.</p>

<h3>German Troops on the Eastern Front Retreat into Winter Quarters; Soviet Communiqué States Progress on All Fronts</h3>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Havas News Agency Dispatch) Military figures here say that German troops on the Eastern Front are continuing to cover the retreat of forward units in order to establish winter positions. Fierce battles have occurred in several locations. Since the German decision to retreat to new positions, Soviet forces have been launching continuous attacks, but they must pay a heavy price for every inch of territory gained. The casualty figures announced by the Soviet side are not reliable.</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch) Last night, Berlin military authorities declared that the retreat of German troops from protruding positions on the Eastern Front to winter quarters is proceeding according to plan. The covering operations of the German rearguard are extremely fierce. Enemy newspapers are sarcastically questioning why the German retreat was not carried out secretly, as Generals Hindenburg and Ludendorff did on the Western Front in 1917. It should be known that in 1917, the military was operating on two fronts. This retreat is not intended to be secret because it is still intended to inflict heavy damage on the enemy. The losses suffered by the enemy in this offensive will be felt in the future.</p>
<p>Headquarters of the German Leader, 11th (Reuters News Agency Dispatch) This afternoon's German war bulletin stated that in the central and northern sectors of the Eastern Front, the enemy launched counterattacks under the cover of tanks, but they were repulsed by German forces.

Active skirmishes took place in the Agedabia region. German aircraft attacked enemy concentrations and British airfields in Cyrenaica.</p>

<h3>Differing Opinions in South America Regarding Participation in the War</h3>
<p>Rio de Janeiro, 10th (Havas News Agency Dispatch) The Pan-American Conference is scheduled to be held here on the 15th of this month. Representatives from various countries arriving here are asking whether the Latin American countries will declare war on the Axis powers. However, two points are very clear: one is whether the United States wants to drag the South American countries into the whirlpool, and the other is whether the South American countries intend to participate in the war. At present, the American countries have implicitly become two factions. One faction, mostly Central American and Caribbean countries, has declared war on the Axis powers. The other faction is South American countries, which have expressed solidarity with the United States but have not yet formally declared war. The Dominican Republic recently announced that it plans to propose to the Pan-American Conference that the American countries unanimously participate in the war. However, Argentine Foreign Minister Guani expressed disagreement with this, and the Brazilian Foreign Minister refused to answer directly. The remaining South American countries are also taking a "wait-and-see" policy. According to well-informed sources, Argentina, Brazil, and other South American countries believe that the best way to defend the Western Hemisphere before the Americas are directly attacked is to stay out of the conflict and provide economic assistance to the United States, similar to the United States' assistance to Britain. It is expected that a declaration will be issued at the conclusion of the Pan-American Conference, reiterating the solidarity of the American countries and stepping up economic assistance to the United States.</p>
<p>Rio de Janeiro, 11th (Reuters Dispatch) The Pan-American Conference is scheduled to open here on the 15th of this month. Representatives from various countries attending the conference are arriving in succession, indicating the enthusiasm of the countries to establish a unified principle. Even if this principle does not necessarily lead to a joint declaration of war against the Axis powers, it will promote the solidarity of the American continent to a complete and flawless state. According to the opinions of diplomatic circles, if the American countries decide to continuously supply raw materials, strive for internal consolidation in South America, and allow the United States to use ports and airfields, then North America will receive effective assistance.</p>

<h3>Authorities Designate Three Major Rice Warehouses to Supply Rice for Coded Sales; Rice Shops Ceasing Operations Seek Relief</h3>
<p>The unified management of rice shops and the sale of foreign rice have been implemented universally since the day before yesterday. Ordinary citizens can purchase rice nearby, which is undoubtedly beneficial. However, yesterday, being Sunday, all rice shops were closed for the holiday as usual, and no rice could be purchased. It is reported that the two authorities have now designated Roosevelt, Moutai, and Fuqi three rice warehouses to release goods today to supply large quantities of rice to various rice shops for sale. It is expected that the rice sales situation will improve even more today.</p>
<p>Unemployed Shop Assistants Awaiting Relief</p>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Rice Shop Association that the 402 rice shops approved to operate in the two concessions were designated by Qu Zhenhua and Shi Hongxun, members of the Rice Shop Association. More than 700 rice shops not listed have ceased operations since the day before yesterday in accordance with the authorities' instructions. However, in order to take care of the livelihoods of more than 5,000 shop assistants of various rice shops, it is necessary to seek relief urgently. The Rice Shop Association has now requested the two authorities to devise additional remedial measures based on the requests of its members. It is heard that the authorities have agreed to consider it carefully and are still negotiating concrete measures, hoping to make a decision within days.</p>
<p>Rice Purchase Finger Dyeing to Start Tomorrow</p>
<p>From tomorrow onwards, rice shops will implement a method of dyeing the fingers of rice purchasers with blue chemical dye: Monday dye the thumb, Tuesday dye the index finger, Thursday dye the middle finger, Friday dye the ring finger, and Saturday dye the little finger. Once this color is applied to the skin, it cannot be erased on the same day. This can prevent one person from purchasing rice multiple times in succession, resulting in an uneven supply.</p>
<p>Noodle Prices Return to Normal</p>
<p>The two associations of machine-made noodle industry and bread and steamed bun industry in this city had previously received an order from the two concessions that the selling price of noodles should be uniformly sold at 9 jiao 5 fen per catty in legal tender. However, because these merchants were insincere and procrastinated over time, engaging in private transactions, the price was raised to 1 yuan 3 or 4 jiao. They were discovered by the two concessions separately, and a total of more than 60 shops were fined or temporarily suspended from business as a warning in accordance with regulations. It is now known that after receiving this concrete warning, these flour merchants have eliminated their greedy hearts and are now able to uniformly follow the standard selling price of 9 jiao 5 fen per catty, and are selling universally on the market, benefiting the common people.</p>

<h3>British Public Buses Completely Suspended Yesterday; Company Authorities Post Notice to Dismiss Employees; Staffing Problems Resolved or Work to be Resumed</h3>
<p>The British-owned China General Omnibus Company in this city had previously reduced the number of runs and shortened unnecessary routes in the middle of last month due to a shortage of gasoline, and advanced the time of entry into the factory every night in order to save fuel. On the 31st of last month, more than half of the employees were laid off, and a labor-management dispute arose a few days ago, which has not been resolved. It is now known that the company suddenly issued a notice of temporary closure the day before yesterday (10th), informing all employees who were retained to not come to work from yesterday. Therefore, from yesterday morning, the British public buses on all routes in the city have been completely suspended, causing inconvenience to public transportation. The gates of the two main factories of the company on Connaught Road are all tightly closed. Yesterday morning, the employees of each shift were not allowed to enter the factory.

She immediately ran towards the back door and shouted for robbers. When the robbers saw that the matter had been exposed, they failed on the spot and also swarmed out of the back door.

<h3>Japanese Side Takes Important Measures; Economic Situation Changes; General Manager Reelected; Taking Over Factories, Clearing Banks, Food, Fuel, and Unemployment Problems Await Efforts</h3>
<p>Economist An Fueneng commented on the economic situation in this port in the past week, saying that it has been five weeks since the Pacific War. After various adjustments were made to the situation in this port in the past week, it has changed significantly. After Japanese business and economic experts conducted a close inspection of the British and American interests in this port for several weeks, they began to take important measures in the past week to make Shanghai invest in the East Asian Economic Sphere.</p>
<p>Four Foreign Directors Resign and Are Reelected</p>
<p>The first major move in the past week was the resignation of the four British, American, and Dutch foreign directors of the Public Works Department. Tokyo had already considered it contradictory to the current situation to allow nationals of countries at war with Japan to remain in the Public Works Department. Therefore, the Japanese side requested their resignation. At the same time, countless personnel from anti-Axis countries also withdrew from various committees of the Public Works Department. The remaining directors of the Public Works Department then elected Japanese Director Okazaki to succeed Liddell as General Manager to continue handling affairs. As for the vacant positions, they are not planning to elect people to fill them temporarily. Currently, there are three Japanese directors, six Chinese directors, one Swiss director, and one German director in the Public Works Department. One British director and two American directors who are not in this port are not included. As for whether the transfer of senior staff of the Public Works Department is also under consideration, it cannot be said for sure.</p>
<p>Clearing Allied Banks</p>
<p>The second major move in the past week was the order of the Japanese Marine Corps to close and clear the Allied banks in this port. These banks were temporarily closed for the previous four days, and the supervisors appointed by the Japanese side to these banks were replaced by newly appointed liquidators. The liquidators immediately began work to conduct a final inspection of the current status of these banks, and their liquidation plans and methods can also be agreed upon. Most banks will reopen this morning. Current or savings deposits of small individual depositors can still be withdrawn. The significance of clearing Allied banks is to prohibit them from engaging in new business and to settle all major transactions as soon as possible. During the Pacific War, these banks will be closed forever.</p>
<p>Taking Over Major British and American Factories</p>
<p>The third important change in the past week was the Japanese side's appointment of supervisors to take over major British and American factories in this port and to restrict the work of these factories according to certain principles. As a result, 18 British and American factories were closed, especially cotton mills. Other factories were allowed to start work within a limited scope, or were allowed to start work completely and resume production. Several factories that were allowed to start work completely have been relieved of the restrictions they have been subjected to for several weeks, such as the unsealing of raw material storage facilities and the lifting of the ban on free sales. However, there are still many Allied factories that have not been taken over by the Japanese side, and they will probably be taken over soon. The Japanese side will sooner or later consider the general issues that have not yet been mentioned.</p>
<p>Food and Fuel Awaiting Assistance</p>
<p>As for the business of Chinese merchants in this port, the Japanese side has not taken any measures. In terms of the banking business of Chinese merchants, the position of HSBC has been replaced by the semi-official Yokohama Specie Bank. The vast majority of Chinese factories continue to work, but countless warehouses are still sealed. The major problems for the future of the entire Shanghai are the external assistance of food and fuel, and the newly arising problem of worker unemployment. The satisfactory resolution of these problems still requires our joint efforts.</p>
<h3>Stealing Paper Nets Arrest</h3>
<p>Chen Zhichao, a Chongming native who used to be a waste paper vendor, has recently been unemployed. He colluded with Pan Gengchang, Liu Afu, and Lin Junfu, who are at large, to open Room 43 in the Longyu Hotel on Fuzhou Road to discuss theft. Knowing that Li Shucui Paper Factory at No. 67, Lane 478, Tiantong Road had a large batch of white paper stored, they hired two rickshaws late the night before last and drove to the address to sneak in through the back door. They stole 2,000 sheets of white paper worth 3,600 yuan, half of which were hidden in the hotel room and half of which were hidden in the house of Tang Wenjun, a Qingpu native, a friend on Aiguo Road, with the intention of selling them and dividing the money. The case was discovered, and detectives from the Hongkou Police Station cracked it, arresting Chen and Tang Wenjun, and taking all the stolen goods to the police station. They were sent to the Special Criminal Court the day before yesterday. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian applied for detention. The court ordered a change of date for review.</p>
<h3>Impersonating Inspectors; Extorting Smugglers Sentenced</h3>
<p>Wang Gan, a rascal from Zhenjiang, and Chen Zhaodong, from Jiangbei, discovered that Lu Gaojian Meat Shop at No. 1179 Gordon Road was storing a large amount of salt for private sale and profiting from it. At around 4 pm the day before yesterday, they colluded with a Korean man and went to the shop, claiming that they were inspectors from the Xianbing Brigade at No. 97 Shangwen Road in the Nanshi, and showed two fake cloth badges to the owner, Zhu Asan, saying that his shop should not sell private salt and that the goods should be sent to the headquarters for confiscation by car. Using various intimidation tactics, they said that if they wanted to avoid trouble, they would have to pay at least 300 yuan as a fee, otherwise there would be no way out. In desperation, the shop owner asked them to forgive him and reduce the fee. Fortunately, shop assistant Zhou Xinrong was alert and sneaked out of the door and reported to the nearby Japanese soldiers, who arrested Wang and Chen and took them to the Putuo Road Police Station along with the fake cloth badges. They were sent to Criminal Court Three of the Special Court the day before yesterday. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian prosecuted them for the crime of extortion and said that the defendant Wang Gan was a repeat offender, asking for a sentence. Judge Zhan questioned the two defendants and made a clear confession, sentencing Wang to eight months imprisonment and Chen Zhaodong to six months imprisonment, respectively, to serve as a warning.</p>
<h3>Poisoning and Collapsing on the Way</h3>
<p>At around 2 pm the day before yesterday, a young man in his twenties, dressed neatly, was walking through the intersection of Zhenjia Wooden Bridge, Avenue Edward VII, French Concession, when he suddenly collapsed. The patrolmen arrived and immediately sent him to Kwong Chi Hospital by car. After examination by a Western doctor, it was found that the man had swallowed medicine in advance, and collapsed at the place where the poison took effect. He died soon after because the poison was too deep to be saved. The French Police Station was notified to send a detective to send the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall autopsy site. It was reported that the autopsy proved to be true. Because there were no family members, the hall provided a coffin for burial.</p>
<h3>Hot Water Shop Owners Request to Continue Selling Cheap Coal Cinders</h3>
<p>The coal industry in this city has been experiencing difficulties in purchasing coal cinders for hot water, and has now stopped selling coal cinders to the bathhouses that sell hot water and the bathrooms need daily. If merchants turn to purchasing high-priced coal, the cost will inevitably increase. More than 540 hot water shop owners in this city yesterday requested the coal industry to purchase coal cinders for hot water so as to continue selling them, benefit the common people, and maintain social order. The coal industry is now actively working on it.</p>
<h3>Mr. Tang Weizhi's Reading and Listening Notes—Authentic Gold</h3>
<p>Mr. Tang Weizhi of Taicang is a great Confucian scholar of the contemporary era. He founded Wuxi National Studies School and promoted sinology with all his efforts. The author has long admired Mr. Tang's superb scholarship and moral character, especially his method of reading Chinese. The day before yesterday, he gave a public lecture on reading methods at the school, a rare opportunity, so I drove there happily. On the one hand, I could get a glimpse of his demeanor, and on the other hand, I could personally listen to his tone of reading, no wonder those who admired him came in droves. Three quarters of an hour before the lecture, the small auditorium was already packed to the brim. The clock struck ten times, and Mr. Tang was seen being supported by someone, his white beard fluttering, walking calmly among the crowd towards the podium. The audience stood up to pay their respects and applauded warmly, and the old gentleman nodded frequently with a smile. After ascending the podium and sitting down, the atmosphere was so solemn that not even the sound of a cough could be heard, and everyone was ready to listen attentively to his grand discourse.</p>
<p>This time, he read four articles, which were divided into four categories according to Zeng Wenzhenggong's hand-defined: Taiyang (Great Yang), Shaoyang (Lesser Yang), Taiyin (Great Yin), and Shaoyin (Lesser Yin), each with an example: The Taiyang vigor is exemplified by Jia Sheng's "Guo Qin Lun" (On the Errors of Qin), the Shaoyang interest is exemplified by Fan Xiweng's "Yueyang Lou Ji" (Record of Yueyang Tower), the Taiyin knowledge is exemplified by Han Tui Zhi's "Song Li Yuan Gui Pan Gu Xu" (Preface to Sending Li Yuan Back to Pan Valley), and the Shaoyin sentiment is exemplified by Ouyang Yongshu's "Wu Dai Shi Ling Guan Zhuan Xu" (Preface to the Biography of the Court Musicians of the Five Dynasties). The so-called Taiyang vigor contains a kind of erupting and turbulent labor, the Shaoyang interest contains a kind of humorous and leisurely interest, the so-called Taiyin degree of knowledge contains a kind of broad and implied degree, and the Shaoyin sentiment contains a kind of deep and tragic rhyme. Therefore, Mr. Tang's reading has its own merits. The method of reading was set by Zeng Wenzhenggong and passed down to Wu Qingfu of Tongcheng. Mr. Tang was a student of Wu Qingfu, and this continuous lineage feels even more precious. Now that he has lost his sight and is old, we really have a sigh of who will succeed him.</p>
<p>Before reading the text, he first explained the essentials of writing an article, and he pointed out that the heart must be pure, starting with cultivating one's character and energy, which is really a needle to the point. How can we expect a base, filthy, and treacherous person to write an immortal article? Even if they write it, it is only to sing praises for their masters and flatter their servants. Who would believe them? We see Fan Xiweng's "Yueyang Lou Ji" saying, "Be the first to worry about the world, and the last to enjoy its pleasures"; Ouyang Yongshu's "Preface to the Biography of the Court Musicians of the Five Dynasties" saying, "Worry and labor can revitalize a country, and pleasure and ease can destroy it"; The old gentleman used an earnest and enthusiastic tone, reciting them aloud, which could not help but immerse us in the general atmosphere of righteousness.</p>
<p>Mr. Tang read "Guo Qin Lun" with great effort, because it was the vigor of Taiyang, the tone was so majestic, the rhythm was clear, and the place where it was read to the climax made people bristle; Then, when it came to "Yueyang Lou Ji", the Shaoyang interest, it felt that it did not lose its majesty, but it did not have the strength of the Taiyang text. Listening to it seemed like eating a cigar, or the excitement of drinking a few cups of mellow wine. When it came to reading the third article, "Preface to Sending Li Yuan Back to Pan Valley", the old gentleman seemed to have exhausted his energy. He sipped a mouthful of boiled water and ordered a gentleman standing beside him to read it on his behalf. Although he could also read it with moderate speed, it always felt like he was losing his composure, without Mr. Tang's solid and grand air, coming from the dantian. Finally, for the "Preface to the Biography of the Court Musicians of the Five Dynasties", Mr. Tang picked up the challenge again, selling his remaining strength, reading it with a sing-song tone, using a gentle and comfortable tone to read out the Shaoyin text, which was really wonderful. Finally, he copied a section on reading essentials as a conclusion: "Every article should be read thirty times, first ten times to learn the method of refining qi, then ten times to observe the method of layout and intention, and then ten times to study the method of selecting words. Once the method of reading with intonation and speed is mastered, the progress of writing will naturally be rapid."</p>
<p>After the meeting, I saw people of all ages, celebrities, and ladies leaving one after another. I also embarked on the journey home with a satisfied mood. In total, there were no less than 500 people in the audience, and this grand occasion showed everyone's emphasis on Chinese studies, living up to the old gentleman's intention to promote it.</p>

<h3>"The Return to Hometown Movement"</h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>Western medicine advertisements are overwhelmingly for tonics, claiming either that the medicine's effects are "comprehensive" or that it has "unimaginable efficacy." This may be due to "scientific progress" or targeting the "weak and sickly" constitution of the Chinese people. However, the wealthy are still obsessed with Jilin ginseng and top-grade bird's nest, spending thousands of gold pieces on a winter's supply. Even those who settle for second best want a prescription for medicinal plasters or donkey-hide gelatin. Cheap cod liver oil at three yuan and several jiao per half-gallon is reluctantly swallowed by friends who are "poor but diligent" as a reward for a year of hard work. Only in recent years has the trend changed dramatically. Cibaoming pills are selling quickly, and there are countless brands of vitamin supplements. Even cod liver oil, which used to be fishy and greasy, now costs thirty to forty yuan per pound (previously only a few jiao), with a price increase far exceeding that of clothing, food (rice), housing, and transportation. The reason given is that imported goods are priced in gold pounds and US dollars, and according to daily exchange rates, "this price is still not enough to buy them." - This was the "catchphrase" of pharmacy clerks two or three months ago. In reality, lead plates and copper sheets, honey, woolen yarn, Hercules milk powder, ammonia, cod liver oil, and even white sugar and matches are all stored in warehouses (even upstairs) and not sold readily. Their motto is "earn money every day it's stored, lose money every time it's sold," so the less product available on the market, the more they frantically buy. If you are truly unfortunate enough to fall ill and require a specific specialty drug, you must pile up banknotes and still ask for favors to "get" your hands on it! However, "good times don't last long." "Selling cheaply" is not enough; they must also declare, "Returning to hometown today, inconvenient to carry" (have you read the "For Sale" section of classified ads?). Cheap goods are indeed timely, but friends with money to spare are also "richly stocked at home," while those without money to buy rice have already "returned to their hometowns early"!</p>
<h3>Facial Makeup</h3>
<p>— Ni Ming</p>
<p>There are countless types of facial makeup in traditional opera. In the opera world, there are no fixed rules to follow. It all depends on oral transmission and memorization. What is memorized is simply the general style of a certain facial makeup (such as the three-tile shattered face or the chaotic face) and its color. In this way, even if there are countless types, it is not difficult to have a clear understanding. As for the subtle styles and colors of a single face, the artist creates them according to their own inspiration. There is no fixed standard. The artist who studies the Jing role's facial makeup with diligence can not only fit the imagery, but also make the audience's faces light up with joy. Although this is a minor art, it is enough to add to the audience's enjoyment of the opera.</p>
<p>In principle, the creation of the styles and colors of all parts of the face, such as the forehead, eyebrows, eyes, nose, and mouth, contains symbolic functions. For example, the gold coins on both cheeks of Ermudun's Gongming signify the characteristics of the God of Wealth. Such major points cannot be arbitrarily changed, but there are also some slight variations. For example, a thin strip of yellow is added to Dou Erdun's red eyebrows, intending to emphasize his majestic power like a tiger. Furthermore, take Xu Shiying in Zhu Yang Lou. It is generally known that he has a green shattered face. I once saw that Zhang Lianting, a martial Jing actor, applied pink to his cheeks, excluding his forehead, nose, and chin. The reason is that Xu is a young master in the Zhu Yang Lou play, so his cheeks should be pink. If the same green were applied to both cheeks as in Baishuitan, it would be impossible to distinguish his different identities and statuses in the two plays. As for the flowered brims of the eyebrows, because of his youthful impetuousness, they should be more pronounced than those of his Tongtian rhinoceros in Baishuitan later. From this, we can see that the makeup artist must have a deep understanding of the character's identity, status, personality, and special appearance in the play before they can transform it magically.</p>
<p>Once a facial makeup is completed, it has one look up close and a different feeling from afar. Up close, one only judges the evenness of the colors and the clarity of the lines but cannot appreciate the extent to which the character's appearance and expression are revealed. Seen from afar, the opposite is true. For example, close-up viewers of Zhang Fei's smile and Gao Deng's fierce expression may find them rigid, but viewed from afar, one senses a smile and a fierceness, each vibrant and lifelike. The display of the smile is in the cheeks, while the fierceness is in the eyebrows. In addition to having the understanding to sketch them out, the artist must also express them concisely to achieve the effect of being visible from both near and far.</p>
<p>Besides the Jing roles, there are many skilled facial makeup artists today, Gao Shenglin, a martial arts actor, being one of them. Shenglin loves this art and can blend the styles of various schools and genres into one furnace. Therefore, his facial makeup in martial arts plays, such as the faces of Qilang and Gao Deng, are uniquely imposing and uniquely styled, which is no accident.</p>
<h3>"Iron-Blooded Traitor"</h3>
<p>The English name of "Iron-Blooded Traitor" is Dark Command, which means "Dark Command". As the name suggests, you can guess the chaos and darkness of the laws and orders at that time. The character here is a famous traitor in the history of the American Civil War. He used the name of a benevolent and righteous army to act as a bandit. In the Confederate war zone, he flew the flag of the Union Army, setting fires and burning, slaughtering and plundering cities. Conversely, in the Union war zone, he flew the flag of the Confederate Army, doing the same thing. Such a character is intertwined with a lingering love story. The script has pretty good material, which is enchanting enough. With the addition of the director's skillful techniques, there is no reason not to be perfect. Speaking of this director, he is very famous, he is the great director Raoul Walsh of "The Roaring Twenties", "Carmen", and "The Thief of Bagdad". Republic Pictures spent a large sum of money to hire this director to take on this difficult task.</p>
<h3>Farewell, Pan-Fried Buns!</h3>
<p>— Si Hua</p>
<p>For breakfast or snacks, Sullivan is certainly a great place to go, but the average student and thrifty person cannot help but feel intimidated by the prices. Slightly more luxurious places, such as Shang Si Ru Chun and Wu Fang Zhai, offer steamed buns or shaomai. Usually, people get by with pan-fried buns or crab shell cakes, which have become everyday delicacies for ordinary people. Today, the Public Works Department, due to the difficulty of flour supply, has instructed the baking and steamed bun industry association that it will suspend the production of all non-essential foods for the common people from now on and try to bake large pancakes and steamed buns as much as possible. Otherwise, the flour supply will be stopped and the business license will be revoked. In this case, pan-fried buns, crab shell cakes, and similar "refined" buns and cakes are all prohibited.</p>
<p>One often sees groups of female students standing by the large pancake stalls along the Continental Shopping Mall. Their clothes are all chic, and they are waiting for the pan-fried buns to come out of the oven. It seems that they regard them as a satisfying lunch. Some wrap them in newspapers, and some chew them on the road, which is quite appetizing.</p>
<p>Usually, when buying snacks, one can order crab shell cakes at double the price. Due to the increase in oil and ingredients, the taste is better. Served with hot water, it is enough to make one's peers envious and compete to imitate them. Now, because the production of pan-fried buns, crab shell cakes, and similar foods has been prohibited, we will no longer have this comforting food, and we will have to learn from the northerners to fill up on tall steamed buns or large pancakes.</p>
<p>Thinking of large pancakes, one thinks of fried dough sticks. Fried dough sticks consume both oil and flour, but they have not been prohibited, which is a fortunate thing. Eating large pancakes and glutinous rice balls with fried dough sticks is like icing on the cake. Now that they are still available, the feeling of incompleteness can be avoided for the time being. Because I am saying goodbye to pan-fried buns, I would like to praise and retain fried dough sticks at the same time.</p>
<h3>Li Qinian's Illness</h3>
<p>Since completing the movie "Modern Youth" directed by Ma-Xu Weibang, Li Qinian has been engaged in the production of a new film, "The Bandit Beauty". The film is almost six or seven tenths completed and will soon be finished. Since the eighth of this month, she has fallen ill due to a cold and work fatigue. As a result, filming has been suspended. It is reported that her temperature rose to 102 degrees yesterday, and two famous doctors are currently consulting. The Huabu authorities have agreed to grant her a leave of absence for half a month to a month for recuperation.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Ou</p>
<p>Sixteen The Fire of Youth</p>
<p>Every time he saw those dancers with waists as thin as water snakes and eyes as charming as thousand-year-old foxes in the dance hall, his heart would jump up and down wildly, but it was only a kind of desire. As soon as he walked out of the dance hall door and breathed in a breath of fresh air, his heart would immediately calm down.</p>
<p>"This is a poison. The label on the bottle is very clear. How can you drink it without considering everything?" He often warned himself in this way.</p>
<p>But as soon as he saw Mei Bao, he felt that this was definitely not a bottle of poisonous wine. Her plain clothes, natural and beautiful face, gentle and dignified demeanor, made Shao Hua fascinated. If she were to be compared to wine, then there would be nothing to compare to her except genuine French champagne!</p>
<p>The strangest thing was that he felt that this singing girl somehow resembled his aunt at home?</p>
<p>However, after returning home, he certainly did not dare to tell Xiang Qi, but secretly looked at her a few more times. As a result, the more he looked, the more she looked like her. So he felt extra excited in his heart.</p>
<p>He remembered very clearly that his father had said several times during casual conversations that his aunt was a school flower at the Tianjin Women's Normal School in the past. She was good-looking and smart in her studies. He really didn't know how many people pursued her. Finally, to save his father's tuberculosis, she married a warlord for the sake of money. Later, almost everyone felt sorry for her.</p>
<p>"If I could get a woman who looks as good as my aunt to be my life partner, Dad and Mom really don't know how happy they would be, and my aunt would also inevitably be greatly surprised. She would never dream that there would be someone in the world who looks so much like her!" One night after returning from the Shouronghua Restaurant, Shao Hua tossed and turned in bed for half the night thinking wildly. (301)</p>
<h3>An Appeal for Buying Rice</h3>
<p>— Ping Ye</p>
<p>It is a fact that there are difficulties in adjusting Shanghai's grain supply. It is also a fact that the Public Works Department and the French Concession authorities are relieving the difficulties of the citizens' food supply. And it is also a fact that it is difficult to buy rice. This food problem, the problem that everyone entrusts their lives to, although everyone has talked about it enough and lamented it enough, has still not been completely resolved. Of course, this difficulty is multifaceted and requires everyone's cooperation to solve it together.</p>
<p>Here, we believe that if the concession authorities had not paid attention to this issue in the past, Shanghai's food supply might have faced unimaginable circumstances. The stability of the market today, which has not yet caused citizens to starve and fight, is still due to the maintenance of the concession authorities.</p>
<p>Those who buy rice struggle almost every day on the line of starvation. They get up early in the morning, not knowing which rice store will open today. They stand and wait blankly. If the store still hasn't opened by mid-morning, they have to rush to another rice store in frustration. Fortunately, this one is open. Like those who have reached their goal, they prostrate and line up. This group of fellow pitiful rice buyers, some are strong and powerful, some are familiar with the store clerks, and some can obtain convenience. "We are all rice buyers today, why must we compete for first and last"? However, they eagerly hope to exchange all their strength for three sheng, but those who obey the order and the old, weak, women, and children are bound to fall behind, and disappointment is inevitable. Returning home, the fire cannot be started until the rice arrives. Now that the rice cannot be bought, they have to endure their hunger and take care of miscellaneous matters. With a half-disappointed mood, they go to the rice store again. Seeing thousands of rice buyers on both sides, the strong and powerful are still in front, and they naturally have to line up last, hoping for a lucky chance. As a result, perhaps the sign "Today's foreign rice sold out" is hung up, and they still wipe away their tears and go back. Thus, there are news reports of families committing suicide by poisoning and not being rescued, some of which are published, and some of which are not published due to space limitations.</p>
<p>Today, as the concession authorities strive to regulate the food supply, the public's expectation is that rice will be sold strictly according to numbers, that the normal daily sales volume of each rice store will be distributed to buyers according to how many numbers there should be, and that those who arrive later will not be given numbers, so as to avoid pushing and shoving, which would only affect order, and also to avoid rice buyers wasting time and delaying their affairs. Those who squeeze in to buy foreign rice, resell it, and buy rice several times a day will be investigated and punished. If there is a more detailed method, that would be even better. These lamentations naturally especially hope that among the rice-buying public, everyone can love themselves!</p>

<p>Family</p>
<h3>Economy First</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>There are more family problems to talk about now than before, but these problems are not about how the living room should be decorated, how duck down quilts should be purchased, and what wines should be used for banquets. Instead, they should be based on the premise of economy. We can think of the following points, which should be implemented immediately:</p>
<p>A monogamous family is naturally the simplest organization. At this time, a new budget for economy can be determined, and all daily expenses can be reduced. If there is a family in which brothers, sisters-in-law, and sisters-in-law live together, they should cooperate at this time and not allow the ill feelings that often exist between sisters-in-law to continue to exist. Two coal stoves that were originally used can be combined into one, meals that were originally eaten separately can be eaten together, and servants that were originally hired separately can be dismissed one or two. Even when doing laundry, the soapy water can be used to wash several pieces of clothing together. If a little can be saved in every place, the accumulated savings can reduce the burden.</p>
<p>At the same time, the choice of dishes is also worth paying attention to. Many inexpensive vegetables have abundant vitamin content, which is more beneficial to the body and cheaper than expensive chicken, duck, fish, and meat.</p>
<p>Under the restrictions of electricity, we might as well get up early and go to bed early. Those who have always lit lamps at night can simply not light them. Those who have always used 40-watt light bulbs can replace them with 25-watt light bulbs. Getting up early is convenient for everyone in the family. The work that needs to be done can be handled more smoothly by getting up in the morning, and going to bed early every day can eliminate the snacks that every family must eat every day.</p>
<p>In families with relatively ample finances, instead of gathering to gamble, why not do some beneficial pastimes? Renovating old clothes and re-knitting old woolen sweaters are also tasks waiting for housewives to do. Husbands can also read a few more books at home. Even if you have to go to the office every day, if the road is not too far, you can get up earlier, or take the car for a while and then walk for a while, which can save some money and give your body some exercise.</p>
<p>The happiness of family life is not entirely in the material aspects; the spiritual aspects may be more important. If every family can cooperate and improve family life under the conditions of economy, then enjoying a happy family life is not impossible at any time.</p>
<h3>The Thoughts of a Spanish Playwright</h3>
<p>— Si</p>
<p>The Spanish playwright, soldier, and great lover Lope de Vega was a superman in the war drama world. He was born on November 25, 1562. In Song Chunfang's first collection of essays on drama, he was called a playwright who was "unprecedented and unsurpassed" because he left behind an astonishing number of works in his lifetime. Even comedies alone numbered as many as 1,800, not to mention other works, letters, etc.</p>
<p>In his lifetime, he said the following: "In my garden, I have some flowers, half a dozen drawings, and a few books. I have no more extravagant desires in my life." The person who excerpted these words once pointed out that they were the mature wisdom he had after tasting the experiences of life.</p>
<p>Naturally, there are no obvious flaws in these words on the surface. However, if we analyze them carefully, we will wonder why he didn't say, "I have a virtuous wife" or "I have a happy family". There is a reason for this.</p>
<p>Because in his lifetime, although he was very busy writing, he had many opportunities to interact with women. He interacted with women from time to time and had many lovers. Even after marriage, he could not devote his love to his wife. Therefore, in his older years, he no longer felt the preciousness of family life and only hoped to look at books in the garden as a way to spend his leisurely years.</p>
<p>However, no one in the world does not want a happy family life. If a man or a woman dislikes his or her family life, there must be some shortcomings in his or her family. Many people's love cannot be focused, and naturally, they cannot work hard to improve their family life. As a result, they are mostly in pain. Modern couples should absolutely abide by sexual morality. Lope de Vega's talent is admirable, but his behavior is not a good example for us.</p>
<h3>Family Governance Sayings</h3>
<p>— Yuan Shan</p>
<p>Reading is the foundation of starting a family; following etiquette is the foundation of protecting a family; diligence and thrift are the foundation of governing a family; harmony is the foundation of managing a family. (Zhu.) The rise and fall of a family depend on propriety and righteousness, not on wealth, nobility, poverty, or lowliness. Suppose one is as noble as a duke or minister and as rich as a Chong Bi, but one has no propriety or righteousness. Then the family will decline. If one eats simple food and drinks plain water, one is not concerned with the fineness of clothing and food, but one has propriety and righteousness. This is what it means to say that the family is thriving. (Lu Xiangshan)</p>
<p>Serenity, conscientiousness, and respect are the first methods to teach young children; fairness, impartiality, and strictness are the first methods to be a parent. (Zi Sheng Bian)</p>
<p>By observing how early or late one sleeps and wakes, one can know the rise and fall of a family. (Jing Xing Lu)</p>
<p>When a person is extremely angry, his wife and children should advise and comfort him in a tactful way and must not raise their voices or get angry. Therefore, it is said that if a family has a virtuous wife, the husband will not encounter misfortune. It is also said that a virtuous wife in a family is like a good prime minister in a country. (Lu Qingxian)</p>
<p>My Family Problems</p>
<h3>Unveiling of Micro-Essays, Part Fourteen Who Will Support Me?</h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>After marriage, thirty years passed in the blink of an eye. My temples are sparsely streaked with silver hair, and my face has some dry and wrinkled lines. I am old, an undeniable fact! Raising four sons and three daughters to adulthood is my achievement in old age.</p>
<p>Among these four sons and three daughters, I gave birth to three sons and two daughters. The rest were raised by my husband's previous wife (because I am a second wife). They have all grown up, and the youngest is over twenty years old. They have all married or left the family and established their own small families. All that is left is me, lonely and helpless.</p>
<p>The illusion of "raising children to guard against old age, storing grain to guard against hunger" has shattered on its own. I live in the house that my husband left me and wear the old clothes that I remade from my wedding clothes, but I don't have food or other living expenses. I don't know who should support me?</p>
<p>If I had known this would happen today, I should not have married in the first place. After marrying, I should not have raised so many children, or I should have been cruel and sent all these children to the orphanage to save myself the burden. The money I saved on raising and educating them would be enough for me to live on for another thirty years. What would I have to worry about? Why wouldn't I do it!</p>
<p>I cannot blame my children entirely because they do have their own difficulties: the money the sons earn is not enough to support their wives; the daughters cannot produce anything at all and are relying on their husbands to eat, so they have no extra money to subsidize me. Moreover, the children all have a mentality, which is "I should plan for my children! Mother doesn't belong to me alone; let others take care of her." Is this way of thinking wrong? I don't know; however, I believe that they will encounter the same old age as me and that their children will treat them in the same way that they treat me.</p>
<p>It is true that raising children is a parent's natural duty, but isn't supporting parents a child's obligation? I also know that treating children as one's own property is selfish; they are products of society, but I don't know how society should treat me?</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Regardless of the system, in the transitional era of the alternation between the old and the new, there are always many victims. The transformation of the family system is naturally no exception. Ordinary old-fashioned parents (such as Old Master Gao in "Home") are obsessed with dreaming of five generations living under one roof and do not realize that the large family cannot exist anymore. Ordinary young and unwise couples also misunderstand that a small family must not allow the existence of elders in order to produce happiness. Therefore, in families that are neither new nor old, many tragedies are produced. The situation of Mrs. Hui has become a victim of this transitional period. I think that nothing can be absolute, especially in the family, because the health of the family depends entirely on cooperation and understanding. If there is a little prejudice, a happy family cannot be created. Since Mrs. Hui cannot live in a specific family, it is best to live in each family in rotation or have each family pay a little subsidy fee, no matter how much, according to their ability. In this case, there is no other way but to open negotiations with your children. You must not let the four sons and three daughters each fail to take responsibility and not ask or hear. At the same time, Mrs. Hui also has to consider the current burden of living. Even if she lives in one of her children's homes, she cannot think of enjoying happiness and must give them some help in their work. Since she can write this micro-essay, she may be able to help educate and raise their children.</p>
<p>I hope that future parents will no longer have the idea of "raising children to guard against old age" and that young couples will not be too irresponsible and shirk each other. Everything must be prepared for in due time, especially the complex and intricate family problems in our country, which are worth discussing by everyone to lay a solid foundation for the future family.</p>
<h3>Aphorisms</h3>
<p>— Canaan</p>
<p>There is one characteristic in human nature that everyone recognizes: that is "liking the new and disliking the old." — Canfield</p>
<p>I really wonder how some people can so calmly blame the reasons for most unhappiness on others. — Ou Mai</p>
<p>Most difficulties become easier after they have been discussed. — Woodfeng</p>
<h3>A Week's Home-Style Menu</h3>
<p>— Hua Ying Wenshi</p>
<p>Under this flying snow, the cold is pressing, and it seems that a hot pot is needed for dinner. There are four types of hot pot. The most luxurious is the white copper yipinguo (a rich man's hotpot), followed by the old-fashioned bronze or white copper warm pot, and then the aluminum small pot and the casserole. At the moment, when it is inconvenient to get alcohol, it is more convenient to use an old-fashioned warm pot with charcoal. As for the dishes in the hot pot, it depends on how economical and plentiful they are. The yipinguo often requires a whole chicken, a whole duck, and a whole pair of trotters or a whole piece of ham, which cannot be done without dozens of yuan and is not affordable for ordinary families. As for the old-fashioned warm pot, its capacity is not large, and both meat and vegetarian dishes can be put in at will, with vermicelli and spinach as the main ingredients. You can garnish it with fish slices, meat slices, dried shrimp, frozen tofu, etc. In this way, two or three kinds of specified meat dishes can be put together. The cost is limited, and you can drink hot soup in the cold weather. Why not do it?</p>

<h3>(156) Improved Education</h3>
<p>— Draft by Lü Yeming</p>
<p>Preparation: One hen, salt, soy sauce, superior soy sauce, MSG, essence, five-spice powder, chopped scallions, minced ginger, cooking wine, caul fat, lotus leaves, thin hemp rope, wine, mud, sesame oil</p>
<p>Method: First, kill the chicken (choose a fat and tender hen), pluck the feathers, remove the internal organs, wash it clean, and lightly rub the inside of the abdomen with salt. Then, immediately soak it in soy sauce for five to six hours. Separately, take fresh pork with both lean and fat parts, wash it, and cut it into small cubes. Mix it with ample amounts of MSG essence, five-spice powder, chopped scallions, minced ginger, and cooking wine. Then, take the chicken out of the soy sauce, and immediately stuff the mixed small meat cubes into the chicken's belly. Wrap the chicken with caul fat, and then wrap it tightly with lotus leaves. Secure it with thin hemp rope. Then, apply a layer of wine mud (the wine mud must first be mixed with water until it reaches an extremely sticky consistency) on the outside of the lotus leaves, about half an inch thick. Then, put it in the embers of pine firewood and simmer it. Simmer for about four hours before serving. During the simmering process, turn it over every hour to ensure that the chicken inside the mud receives heat evenly. Before serving, first break off the outer layer of mud, untie the rope and remove the lotus leaves. Slightly coat the chicken skin with sesame oil to enhance the aroma. This method of making [chicken] originated in Changshu. Initially, when it was made, the feathers and internal organs were cooked together, but now it has been improved.</p>
