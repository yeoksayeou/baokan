<p>他說：「男子們因爲感覺疲倦，於是結婚女子們因爲好奇，於是結婚，結果大家都失望了。」</p>
<p>的確男子們在事業稍有成就以後，就希望因結婚而獲得精神的調劑，然而當他結婚以後，發覺他更加多了他的責任。女子們年齡一點點的長大，希望由結婚而開始一種新的生活，結果也使他們失望了。</p>
<p>本來結婚是一種責任，要使結婚生活美滿，必須互相諒解互相幫助，並且還應該爲下一代着想而從事自身的修養。</p>
<p>在這個時期結婚的人，還是很多，他們應該注重精神，否則在物質條件缺乏的狀態下，往往會艱生不滿意結果。要使結婚生活美滿，對於結婚智識的求取實在是一個先決條件。</p>
<h3 id="c35">丈夫意見測騐 <a href="#c35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>— 李思華</p>
<p>不久以前，美國聖路易地方曾經舉行一次丈夫測騐，雖則只在那一處地方舉行，然而所搜集的材料，可以代表一般丈夫的意見。</p>
<p>受測騐的丈夫，完全都是結婚五年以上的，第一個問題是「那一點是你的妻子最使你不滿意的？」多數的丈夫，都回答說他們的妻子實在太浪漫了。有一部份的丈夫，說他們的妻子過於固執，喜歡獨斷獨行地處置家裏的一切事情。</p>
<p>第二個値得注意的問題是『那一點是你的妻子最使你感覺滿意的。』所有參加測騐的丈夫，沒有一個把妻子的美貌，作爲這個問題的答案，最多數的丈夫都說是妻子給他們的伴侶，其次是妻子們的忠心，再次是妻子們和善的脾氣。這第三點包括着許多的方式，有些丈夫說：『他的妻子常常地笑』有些丈夫說，『他的妻子像日光『樣的和暖』，有些丈夫，認爲他們的妻子的具有自制力的性格正和他們溫和的態度相配合，更有許多丈夫，舉出學識的豐富，具有耐心，家庭經濟調度有方，作為他們滿意他們的妻子的理由。</p>
<p>還有一個問題，就是『你的妻子的那一種動作，使你滿足？』對於這一個問題的答案，美不勝收，我們不妨挑選幾個，列在下面：</p>
<p>『不論我什麽時候下樓，早餐已經預備好？』</p>
<p>『對於使用金錢，能彀有具體的預算。』</p>
<p>『在辦公時間，決不打電話給我』</p>
<p>『時常勸導我節省費用。』</p>
<p>『不是時常約朋友來打牌。』</p>

<p>衣服上偶沾火油，不必洗滌，只要把它懸掛在通風之處，不久自然蒸發消散，同時氣味也消失了。</p>
<p>放置碗碟和食物的櫥裏，最好常放幾撮新花椒，可逐鼠，若常放幾撮樟腦，可辟灶馬</p>
<p>磨墨的時候，若以醋代水，則更烏黑有光，冬季磨墨，常患冰凍，假使用酒精代水，效果很好。</p>

<p>皮鞋油不免變成堅硬，難於使用，若和入牛乳少許，即能轉爲軟潤。</p>
<p>假使碗碟上面，有了積垢，而屢次揩拭，不能除去，可用食鹽和醋，重加洗擦，結果一定可以美滿。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Fourth Bombing of Surabaya, Situation in Java Gradually Tensing, Fierce Air Battles Near Bali, Frequent Japanese Aircraft Activity in the Dutch East Indies <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Domei News Agency) – Imperial Headquarters announced at 5:15 PM today that during the second naval air raid on Surabaya and the first air raid on the airfield in Kipalen, Bali, on Thursday, a total of 34 enemy aircraft were shot down or destroyed. During the attack on Surabaya, Japanese aircraft destroyed 26 enemy aircraft, including 11 American and 15 Dutch. During the attack on Kipalen airfield, a total of 8 aircraft were shot down in the air and destroyed on the ground.</p>
<p>Washington, 8th (Reuters) – The War Department announced yesterday that 80 American destroyers in the Dutch East Indies were attacked by a superior Japanese aircraft formation near Bali.</p>
<p>Batavia, 8th (Reuters) – Batavia Radio announced this afternoon that Surabaya had been bombed for the fourth time. The main targets of the attack were Surabaya Harbor and the naval base. It was also disclosed today that Japanese aircraft reconnoitered Batavia. Batavia has not been attacked by the Japanese forces until now.</p>
<p>Batavia, 8th (Reuters) – The Dutch East Indies Official Gazette stated today that several Japanese aircraft attacked Surabaya again. Yesterday, Japanese aircraft reconnoitered Batavia, and several seaplanes flew to eastern Java for reconnaissance. Muntok Harbor on Bangka Island has been bombed, with fires breaking out in multiple locations and causing significant damage. Palembang in southeastern Sumatra was attacked by a large Japanese formation of fighter-protected bombers, and several Dutch aircraft on the ground were bombed and caught fire. There was some reconnaissance activity in northern Sumatra.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Domei News Agency) – Military commentators criticized the two Japanese air raids on Java on Friday, stating that the strategy of Japanese aircraft activity was entirely aimed at eliminating the enemy's guerrilla base of operations and cutting off the Allied communication lines between Australia, the Dutch East Indies, and Singapore.</p>
<p>London, 8th (Reuters) – Reuters correspondent Walker reported by telephone from Batavia that based on observations, the next major operation by the Japanese army appears to be a large-scale attack on Java, the center of Allied resistance in the southwestern Pacific region. This action by the Japanese army may be launched simultaneously with the attempt to occupy Singapore Island. Some believe that the recent intense Japanese air raids on Surabaya are a prelude to the Japanese offensive, while the Japanese attack on the world-renowned Bali Island yesterday was a flanking maneuver in preparation for the attack on Surabaya, as aircraft departing from the airfield on Bali Island can reach Surabaya in less than half an hour. At the same time, Japanese aircraft flew to Batavia for reconnaissance. If the Japanese army launches an attack on Java, they will encounter defensive positions deployed at various key points on the island. The reporter has recently witnessed these defensive positions, which are solid as gold in terms of deployment, location, and morale. The commander of one of these positions told the reporter, "We are ordered to defend these positions to the end. You should know what this statement means."</p>

<p>Rangoon, 8th (Reuters) – It may now be disclosed that General Wavell, commander of the Allied forces in the southwestern Pacific, recently made two short visits to Burma and spoke with British officers and soldiers on the Mawlamyine front.

Registration is done in the morning, and items are retrieved from the boxes starting at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. The opening hours for Chase Bank safe deposit boxes have been changed to 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM daily. HSBC, on the other hand, arranges the opening days according to the safe deposit box numbers, with one week as a unit, and rotates the extraction of items from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM in the morning and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM in the afternoon. It has now entered the second week.</p>
<p>Safe Deposit Boxes Will Be Inspected by a Deadline</p>
<p>The bank suddenly issued a notice the day before yesterday stipulating that HSBC safe deposit box renters who have not visited the bank to open the box and inspect or retrieve the permitted items since the 29th of last month must go to the bank to open the box and inspect the items before the 14th of this month (Saturday, Lunar New Year's Eve). The bank is eager to accelerate this work, as the sooner the preliminary procedures for retrieving certain items from the safe deposit boxes are completed, the sooner further measures can be implemented.</p>
<p>Regulations for Stored Packages Have Not Changed</p>
<p>According to an HSBC senior official, the safe deposit box retrieval times announced by the bank in the middle of last month will no longer be cyclical. He believes that the bank will likely stipulate a new method, opening and inspecting these safe deposit boxes once a week, with the date yet to be determined. The official also stated that although the opening method for safe deposit boxes will be changed, the opening method for packages in safe deposit boxes announced by the bank on the 29th of last month will continue to be valid.</p>
<p>Withdrawal Applications Have Not Been Approved</p>
<p>Regarding applications for essential expenditures from commercial firms, the official solemnly stated that no application has been approved to date, but some applications are expected to be approved in the near future. When the reporter inquired about the issue of payroll in commercial firm expenditure applications, the official said that even if the application is approved, the salary of Allied employees exceeding 2,000 yuan will not be paid in full. Currently, only HSBC and Citibank among the Allied banks have approved this type of application. Chase Bank has not yet approved applications for commercial firm expenditures or the withdrawal of company salary deposits.</p>

<p>A Chinese employee of Longdong Foreign Firm at No. 9 Edward Road, Mr. Tong, was entrusted by his relative, Mr. Wu Xingcai, to transfer 10,800 shares of China Textile Company stock, worth 108,000 yuan, to Xinchang Foreign Firm at No. 88 Museum Road for transfer of ownership. Unexpectedly, Mr. Dai Xueshu, a clerk from Tianjin in the stock department of that firm, secretly stole the shares and left his job during the chaos of December 8th of last year, hiding them at his colleague Tan Baisui's residence at No. 16 Gude Lane, Route Paul Beau. Later, Dai entrusted Mr. Zong Huinong, a broker at Lili Han Company at No. 307 Hamilton House, Jiangxi Road, to sell 2,000 shares of China Textile stock for 13,000 yuan. Chen suspected that the name on the stock did not match and became suspicious. After investigation, the above situation was discovered. The case was reported to the General Police Station, which dispatched detective Cheng Renkun to arrest Dai Xueshu and Tan Baisui and confiscate all the shares. They were brought to the police station for interrogation. It was discovered that Dai had stolen a total of over 20,000 shares of Xinchang Foreign Firm stocks, including China Textile, Xinhuo Yarn Factory, and Shanghai Textile stocks, worth 127,350 yuan. He also forged the seals of Wu Xingcai and Luo Caifu. He and Tan Baisui were jointly prosecuted. They were brought to court yesterday morning, and the defendant hired a lawyer to defend them. The court ordered them to be taken back into custody, and Tan was allowed to post a bail of 20,000 yuan for release pending the verdict on the 13th.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Three Religions Moral Charity Association, despite operating in difficult circumstances, continues its relief efforts to the best of its ability. Since the beginning of winter, in addition to distributing over 5,000 sets of winter clothing, it has continued to provide meal tickets as usual. However, due to the recent severe shortage of food and rising prices, the association fears that problems may arise in the cooperation with its meal distribution points. Therefore, it has decided to temporarily suspend the distribution of these meal tickets by the end of March and will instead establish food distribution centers for the poor, so that impoverished people can receive practical benefits and avoid starvation. Philanthropic individuals who have donated to the association to purchase meal tickets are urged to distribute them all as soon as possible, to avoid future discrepancies between the food distributed and the face value of the tickets. The association still hopes that philanthropic individuals from all walks of life will generously donate to assist with its food distribution efforts. Furthermore, the Chinese Religious Moral Society, in order to provide relief to countless refugees in the city, has established three soup kitchens in the two concessions and Hongkou, providing congee. The locations of the three soup kitchens are No. 121 Tongfu Road, Route Remi, and Yangshupu Road. Anyone wishing to receive congee must first apply to any of the three locations. Upon approval, each person will receive three bowls of hot congee. The distribution times are from 8 AM to 10 AM and from 5 PM to 8 PM daily. However, each person may only apply once per day.</p>

<h3 id="e34">The Purpose of Marriage <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Everyone has a different purpose for marriage. I think that a quote from Oscar Wilde, the author of "Lady Windermere's Fan," is worth studying.</p>
<p>He said: "Men marry because they are tired; women, because they are curious: both are disappointed."</p>
<p>Indeed, after men achieve some success in their careers, they hope to gain mental refreshment through marriage. However, after they marry, they find that they have even more responsibilities. As women grow older, they hope to start a new life through marriage, but they are also disappointed.</p>
<p>Marriage is, in essence, a responsibility. To make married life fulfilling, both parties must understand and help each other, and they should also engage in self-cultivation for the sake of the next generation.</p>
<p>Many people are still getting married during this period, and they should focus on spiritual aspects. Otherwise, in the absence of sufficient material conditions, dissatisfaction will often arise. To make married life fulfilling, acquiring knowledge about marriage is a prerequisite.</p>

<p>Not long ago, a husband survey was conducted in St. Louis, USA. Although it was only held in that one place, the materials collected can represent the opinions of husbands in general.</p>
<p>The husbands surveyed had all been married for more than five years. The first question was, "What is the one thing that your wife does that you find most unsatisfactory?" Most of the husbands answered that their wives were too romantic. Some husbands said that their wives were too stubborn and liked to handle everything in the home in a dictatorial manner.</p>
<p>The second noteworthy question was, "What is the one thing that you find most satisfying about your wife?" None of the husbands participating in the survey listed their wife's beauty as the answer to this question. The most common answer was that their wives gave them companionship. The second most common answer was the wives' loyalty, and the third was their kind temperament. This third point included many aspects. Some husbands said, "His wife often laughs." Some husbands said, "His wife is as warm as the sun." Some husbands believed that their wives' self-controlled personalities complemented their gentle attitudes. Many husbands cited their wives' rich knowledge, patience, and skill in managing household finances as reasons why they were satisfied with their wives.</p>
<p>There was also a question: "What action of your wife satisfies you?" The answers to this question were overwhelming. We may as well select a few and list them below:</p>
<p>"No matter what time I come downstairs, breakfast is already prepared?"</p>
<p>"She is able to have a specific budget for the use of money."</p>
<p>"She never calls me during office hours."</p>
<p>"She often advises me to save money."</p>
<p>"She does not often invite friends over to play cards."</p>

<p>If oil stains accidentally get on clothes, there is no need to wash them. Just hang them in a well-ventilated place, and the oil will naturally evaporate and dissipate, and the smell will also disappear.</p>
<p>It is best to keep a few sprigs of fresh peppercorns in the cupboard where bowls, plates, and food are stored to repel mice. If you often put a few sprigs of camphor, you can repel cockroaches.</p>
<p>When grinding ink, if you use vinegar instead of water, the ink will be blacker and shinier. In winter, it is common to have problems with ink freezing. If you use alcohol instead of water, the effect is very good.</p>
<p>Remove the thin skin from both sides of fresh whole raw lard, cut it into two-inch squares, mix it with white sugar, and store it in a porcelain container. It can be stored for at least a winter.</p>
<p>Shoe polish inevitably becomes hard and difficult to use. If you add a little milk, it will become soft and moist.</p>
<p>If there is dirt accumulated on bowls and plates that cannot be removed after repeated wiping, you can re-wash them with salt and vinegar, and the result will definitely be satisfactory.</p>

<p>— Ms. Huaying</p>
<p>Pork was once so expensive that it cost more than five yuan per catty, making people feel like they hadn't tasted meat in three months. Recently, for some reason, it has become much cheaper, around three yuan per catty. In the past, my family often ate dishes like rapeseed stir-fried with shredded pork and celery stir-fried with shredded pork. One yuan's worth of meat couldn't be cut into much, and often only vegetables were visible, which was truly pitiful! But these days, we can actually eat whole pieces of meat. For example, stewed pork with Chinese cabbage is delicious, and the meat oil makes it extra rich. Another example is winter bamboo shoots and salted meat soup, where small pieces of salted meat, fresh meat, and winter bamboo shoots are stewed together. If you have salted Chinese cabbage at home, adding some of it will not only enhance the flavors of these four ingredients but also make the soup very tasty.</p>
<p>Monday: Stir-fried Ten-Delicacy Meat with Sauce, Small Yellow Croaker with Pickled Mustard Greens, Stir-fried Chinese Cabbage, Scallion Oil Radish Strips</p>
<p>Tuesday: Celery and Beef Strips, Stir-fried Fish Soup, Spinach with Tofu, Cold-Tossed Flowering Cabbage</p>
<p>Wednesday: Braised Pork Knuckles with Soybeans, Dried Shrimp Egg Drop Soup, Pickled Mustard Green and Broad Bean Paste, Sweet and Sour Spicy Cabbage</p>
<p>Thursday: Beef Stir-fried with Vermicelli, Braised Green Carp Slices, Stir-fried Cabbage, Vegetarian Tofu Soup</p>
<p>Friday: Braised Lamb Leg, Glass Noodles and White Fish Head, Vinegared Julienne Mustard Greens, Snowy Pea Sprouts</p>
<p>Saturday: Winter Bamboo Shoot Stewed with Salted and Fresh Meat, Scallion Roasted Small Fish, Braised Vegetarian Ten-Delicacy, Sesame Sauce Mixed with Celery</p>
<p>Sunday: Ten-Delicacy Hot Pot, Fried Ribbonfish, Stir-fried Greens, Stir-fried Radish</p>

<h3 id="e38">(158) Taro Cake <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Mingjiong (Draft)</p>
<p>Ingredients: Taro (or peeled potatoes), flour, eggs, scallions, salt or sugar, soybean oil, MSG</p>
<p>Preparation: Wash the taro or potatoes, put them in a pot and pre-fry until tender, then mash them. Crack the eggs into a bowl, add a little flour, chopped scallions, salt or sugar, and MSG to taste, and mix well. Then pour it into the mashed taro and stir. Do not make it too wet. Make round or oval cakes as thick or thin as copper coins, then put them in boiling oil and fry until golden brown on both sides. This cake is easy to make and tastes delicious; it is truly a fine product.</p>
<h3 id="e39">(159) Oath of the Peach Garden <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Qingfang (Draft)</p>
<p>Ingredients: Shrimp meat, pork belly, fresh chicken meat, walnut meat, sugar, MSG, sesame oil, cooking wine</p>
<p>Preparation: First soak the walnut meat in boiling water for a moment, peel off the skin, put it in boiling oil and fry it briefly before taking it out. Separately wash the shrimp meat, pork belly, and chicken meat. Boil the pork belly in water until cooked, then cut it into small cubes. Cut the chicken meat into small pieces. Then, heat oil in a wok, stir-fry the pork belly cubes, shrimp meat, and chicken cubes together. Add MSG, white sugar, cooking wine, salt, and sesame oil to taste. Finally, pour in the fried walnut meat and stir-fry together. Serve while hot. The taste will be crispy and delicious.</p>
<p>Gentlemen: If you present "MSG", "Wei Zong", or "Tian Chu Soy Sauce Extract", which are produced by Tianchu MSG Factory, as gifts to relatives and friends, they will be most welcome.</p>
