<p>巴基維區與其說是傑出的軍人無　說是一個偉大的組織家兼聰明的外交家。據說當他與土耳其交戰而捷報頻傳的時候，北方各族頗爲寗靜。姑不論事實如何，實際上巴基維區於一八二九年歸回俄國的數年後,Muridism宗敎運動所含有的然烈的希望和信仰逐漸在地下佔據勢力，而當它實際爆發的時候，對於俄國猶如晴大霹　！沙皇尼哥拉斯第一世是較他的臣下更有遠見的人物。他對於事態的嚴重性感到極度煩惱，於八三七年他努力設法與領等叛亂最不易馴服的回敎王侯沙密　親自會晤。不幸此項會晤從未變成事實；沙王所派特使與沙密邇接洽會晤情事時變方竟發生衝突，自此之後，沙密邇從未信任俄人，而直到二十二年之後他才被迫降服。</p>
<p>在這最後一段期間的大　份時間。在盒波崙戰爭中已威名大振的伏羅卓夫公爵担任俄方總司令。這聰明而幹練的將領，經過一八四五年至四八年毫無結果的戰役後，專心致意於內政改革，在這方面他大獲成功。迄至一八五六年他和沙密　均取守勢，以便伺機進攻。伏羅卓夫不久獲悉山岳戰爭的困難和有利於敵方之形勢下應戰的危險。英人巴特莢所著的俄國之征服高加索書中對於這種形勢有着生動活潑的　寫。以下是一八興五年的戰役中之一段插話：</p>
<p>「九點鐘光景，全部軍隊已抵達森林的邊緣。在這裏指輝官傳令作數小時的休止，使兵士暫息並進餐以備進攻。向北的景緻，在俄人眼睛頗有吸引力。他們的脚下躺著敵對之却區尼亞，起伏不斷的山脈連綿達數十哩，點綴著濃密的森林和陰鬱的深谷。……在蔚　的彼方，地平綫下的一條影子就是俄國，許多人對之作最後的一瞥。往達哥的路綫在峻峭而樹木蓊鬱的橫嶺頂上展開着，絕無廣闊之處，有些地方竟狹隘至數呎廣，全程形成極長的斜坡，間或路面突然聳起。每行四百碼或五百碼，樹校盤繞之巨樹的拒木阻止進路，而兩邊樹木濃密的谿谷中埋伏着無數的敵兵……</p>
<p>伏羅卓夫公爵在沙密　最後之降服實現之前，已離開高加索。自從沙密　降服後，俄國才得正式確立從黑海到裏海的控制權。截止此時，雙方已從事無數殘忍的舉動，而人跡罕至的村落和山中之農園也經蹂躪小堪，可是基本的團結終於取有古舊傳統的無政府狀態而代之，而高加索也得享受更高的更有組織的興隆的文化了</p>
<p>直到第、次俄國革命開始動搖俄羅斯帝國的全部機構的時候，高加索　紛亂又死灰復燃，形勢嚴”起來。在一九〇二年至〇五年的事件中，除了高加索人反抗俄人的傳統之敵愾心外，高加索民衆對俄國民衆的反抗他們同樣受着壓迫的官僚　級及地主階級表示同情的新的遝動已在開始展開。俄人中具有達見的人士深知喬其亞農人約懷抱不滿實具有充分理由，而最後一任高加素　俄國總督　許哥夫之憂鬱的報告中已將這情勢加以透澈的分析</p>
<p>然而俄方絕未嘗試改良局勢。言之殊可扼腕，實際上沙皇政府如能巧妙地應付此項局勢並對喬其亞的文化上之要求採取自由放任的態度，那麼過去喬其亞和俄國之間慕督敎上的聯繫也許尚可發揚光大。相反地，與俄國分離的運動和普羅運動竟並行地展開着，至一九一七年革命爆發的時候，外高加索已陷於極度混亂之中。它首先爲德軍佔領，接着又爲協約軍所佔據，雙方的目的都是爲阻止油井的落入敵方的手中。</p>
<p>直到一九二一年　助於過激派在各地的暴動，紅軍才得把喬其亞，阿美尼亞和亞塞拜然處於其控制之下，使它們成爲整個蘇聯的一部。嚴　的足亂曾於一九二四年爆發；可叛自從那時以來蘇聯所實施的賢明的政策，已將局勢全部改觀。相當程度的文化的自治，對社會改革的密切的注意，國立農塲的設立，新的學校，辨院和　養院的開辦，無疑地已將主張與俄國分離的一派夕氣熖熄减於無形之中。總之，今日的高加索人　深切地感到他們和俄人的關係已處於帳往日史平等更能固的基礎之上了（完）</p>

<h3 id="c43">疏散工作之新開展　遣賑貧苦市民　既日開始申請爲期一月調查確屬貧苦酌給川資 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>自從去年太平洋戰事爆發以來、疏散本市過剩人口、早就經公認爲當務之急。及後工部局理軍事會通過正式設立華人疏散委員會、疏散工作，乃達至急劇展開的階段、</p>
<p>疏散意義</p>
<p>本市為一國際性的都市、同時亦爲一工商性的都市、因爲具具有國際性、因之麕集渚極多的鄰近城郊的避難居民、因爲其爲工商性的都市、因之容納着極多的工人。商人、但是太平洋戰爭突發、原料來源告斷、商品外銷全無、本市食糧問題。同時亦開始更深切更嚴重的威脅、使此批失業之工人商人回鄉另覓出路、使此批避難本市的鄰郊居民重返故里、就回鄉者本身言、可晚離米糧的威脅和高物價的漩渦、而就全市着想、則爲維護本市治安與繁榮之必要措施，</p>
<p>幾度改革</p>
<p>本會於本年二月成立之初、即得華中鐵道公司及東亞海運株式會社之協力、、對於回鄉華人、一律予以半價優待、以使疏散工作、能獲更圓滿的結果、至四月底止、經本會頒發半價返鄉證者、共達五〇五六五人、自五月一日起、則因二公司損矢過巨、疏散工作雖照常進行、半價優待則暫告停止、但自五月一日至六月底二月中、因幣制的更迭。投機的猖獗、物價之高漲。更爲駭人、來本會要求返鄉證者、共一八六七四人、至要求川資優待者、爲數更夥、目今漲風難戢、然貧苦市民之無力維持此高巨之生活費用者、比比皆是、本會發出之回鄉證、日　千張以上、至探詢優待辦法者、常接連不輟、本會當以半價辦法早經停止、除對於請求發給回鄉證者盡量予以便利外、對於請求資助或優待者、無法援助、但本會鑒於現時貧苦市民生活之艱、而車輪川資又高巨駭人、市民之欲回鄉而乏川資者、爲數確爲甚多、故會分頭向各方協商、以謀能有妥善辦法、有助於貧苦市民、近得賑委會上海分會夕協力、決與本會合辦本市貧苦市’民造賑、對於缺乏川資面欲回鄉之市民、此誠爲一大福音</p>
<p>辦法改善</p>
<p>此次　遣賑，與上次本會興辦之半價優待、就性質　、有甚大夕區別、上次之川資半價優待、其目的純爲優待返鄉之本市居民、故凡居住本市之市民、確欲冋至原籍鄉里而並不回至本市者、皆可向本會申請優待、但此次遣賑之目的、僅為救濟貧苦市民之欲離滬而乏川資者、故其對象僅爲確欲返鄉之貧苦市民、因此次遺賑與上次半價優待性質之不同、對於申請手　方面、自亦稍有不同、以使眞正貧苦市民、能普沾利益。而取巧市民、不能施其技倆、</p>
<p>申請手續</p>
<p>本會此次與賑務委員會上海分會合辦遣賑、關於申請調查核准事項、山本會負責辦理、關於發款事項則決定由賑委會辦理、凡木市貧苦市民確欲回至原籍者。可至福州路工部局大厦二百七十七號本會素取申請書、申請書塡就後、須由所住地戶長甲長或各慈善機關負責保證確屬貧苦、月欲回籍者、再送至本會、經本會調查屬實、始可再至本會領取回鄉證及賑票‘再憑賑票至賑委會上海分會領取經本會核准之應得款項、手續雖稍麻煩、但是流弊却可泯除了、</p>
<p>酌助川資</p>
<p>關於遣賑款項、每人應得數目問題根據本會與振務委員會擬定的原則、爲資助全部川資十分之三、但如全部川資之十分之三超過一十五元者、資助二十五元、由川資或有根　火車價、或有根據輪船價、數目不一、本會爲辦軍簡捷迅速起見、特擬定各項標準、凡至各大城鎭或其附近小城鎭者、即照標準所列發給遣賑費、如路程遼遠者、則一律發給二十五元、若有虛報目的地者、一經本會調查屬實、除取消其應得夕款項外、保證人並負相當責任、</p>
<p>各界協助</p>
<p>木市自經疏散人口以來、截至現今者、由木會發給同鄉證者約達十萬人、合萬國商團所發回鄉證數內、則爲數當更可覩、但以本市人口過多關係、以視今日全市人口、仍無多大影響、以視現今本市虎疫之猖獗、物價之堅持不跌、可知疏散工作之重要性、仍有增無减、木會職責所在、自當竭盡心力、爲疏散工作、盡。大努力、希望全市各界、都能深切認識疏散工作、對於疏散者本身及令市居民、二獲其利、而予以協大、關於回鄉證本會現仍委托各同鄉會各國體繼　發給、如中國旅行社。世界旅行社。寗波同鄉會紹興同鄉會。皆可代爲發給、手續極爲簡單、</p>
<p>唯一機會</p>
<p>這一次的遺賑、自本月十三日開始舉行、為期一月、希望貧苦市民、不要失去這樣一個回鄉的好機兪、各慈善機關、各大團備之要保送貧苦市民來本會巾請者、亦甚爲歡迎、但須切實注意其是否貧苦、是否確實返鄉、以使眞正貧苦市民、能多一個機會、並注意開　新幷與保存原有水井、上項自然水利及水井等、如屬適當者得以代替（甲）（丁）兩項、　防火用器具。甲、每戶準備容量八公升之水桶（圓形、）乙。家庭防空隊、須存放水能力每分鐘七十公升以上之二人輕便幫浦、並須附以長十　米突之引水管二條以上、丙、在貯藏油類藥品等發火性或引火性物品之處所、應準備泡沫滅火器及四癢化炭素滅火機等、　其他。甲、每戶應準備約五十公升黃砂或泥土、乙、每戶應準備草蓆、水杓、丙、應準備便於　作之衣服。襪子。帽子等、以備消防工作時着用、丁、家庭防空隊應準備網。鐵　長棒（約二米突長、）以及輕便梯子、戊、家庭防空隊、在各戶境界內、設置　路或緊急出入口、以便防火上互相協力、（待績）</p>

<p>話說上海地方，凡百事業，金　噱頭，有了噱頭，不僅溫飽無慮，而且可以成名發財。噱頭有關天才，席碌之輩，頭腦機能欠靈活，但見人發財，却是眼紅心熱得很。因此，每一種噱頭發明，總得一大批人一窠風跟進。大之，巳往信交風潮，小之，鷄粥菜飯也曾盛極一時。戰後至今，有二窠風來勢奇猛，幾乎吹得令人頭暈目眩。最先是花紗號銀號，倏起倏滅，接下保險股票企業茁起如雨後春笋。兩月之前，忽然有人選中新世界三樓一角之地，開設高樂歌塲，　先大舉宣傳，什麽簇新姿態，什麼理想樂園，總之，措辭力量深入人心，不去觀光，有枉爲人世之憾。上海人是慣吃這一功的，果然，開慕以後，生意興隆，無以復加。不到一月，十萬尤齊本足足賺個對本對利。於是握着游資正苦沒處營生的商人，紛起仿傚。巳經開慕的，計有高樂。爵祿。張園。天宮。金門。原有小廣寒時代二家，深恐落伍，趕快重新妝修。加緊籌備，開張有期的共四家，大華：南京路仝羽春樓上。大新：虞洽卿路大新公司六樓舞廳原址。長樂：四馬路長樂茶樓。晋隆西菜社三樓，亦在改建歌塲，名稱未定。此外資本慕足，尚未覓得適當地盤的，猶不知若干家。眞所謂猗歟盛哉了！</p>
<p>考歌塲之在上海，可云向亦有之，於今爲烈。淸末民初吾不知，約在民國十年左右，黃楚九氏經營大世界，魄力相當偉大，除南北雜耍兼收並蓄外，更有兩個大塲子，着實哄動一時。其一是乾坤劇塲大京班，另一便是共和廳　芳會唱，廣延北里名花。人才甚盛。約摸說來，這該是上海歌塲之濫觴。其後六七年，四馬路靑蓮閣新屋落成，有人利用該處晚上空檔，在三樓開設小廣寒歌塲，格局大致和共和廳彷彿，不過已興點唱之例，票資小洋兩角，點唱每齣一元。記憶得起的角色，有想容。吳翠芬。　九齡。美華。小小玲瓏。紅弟。曹蕙芬等，或以色勝，或以藝鳴，陣容不可謂弱。加以票資低廉，所以開慕未久，就添辦日塲，票價更廉，僅小洋一角而已。上面說過，上海人喜歡一窠風，有人見小廣寒獲利，急起直追，不久，小廣寒斜對面開設長樂，三馬路開設時代。白步之內，三家並峙，競爭何消說得？起先還只是些電話定座，香水手巾之類小節目，繼以出奇制勝，小廣寒在淸唱之後，添餘興一節，聘北方雅韻集房人迷。王麻子。張蝦蟆表演滑稽，雅韻集有拿手傑作大補缸一齣，極受看客歡迎。其餘二家，自然不甘示弱，連忙照式買一送一。如是相持一二年，又是小廣寒別出心裁，時正張恨水啼笑因緣說部風　一時，張石川顧無爲爲搶奪　影攝製權，官司一直打到行政院，就在這難解難分萬衆注目之際，小廣寒老關奇兵突出，把它編成平劇，由淸唱歌女扮演，演出成績如何，不必批評，但這一記噱頭，却是新鮮不過的。連演一月，目夜客滿，鈔票滾滾而來，老板躊躇滿志，不在話下。</p>
<p>時代長樂至此方始覺得抄老文章終非上策，制勝之道，端在另翻花株。於是索性根本改革，聘請一批坤角，以表演平劇爲主，淸唱爲輔。未幾，小廣寒回頭加人競爭，這是民國廿五年以後的事。</p>
<p>小廣寒時代，長樂既向時改演髦兒戲式之平劇，競爭益烈，挖角第一，宣傳第二，各不示弱。小鐵寒擁有台柱小王虎辰，周碧雲，姜小樓，蘇翠霞，劉琴心。時代擁有台柱張文娟，姜雲霞，周梅艷，長樂擁有台柱樂弟，秋雲艷，周美娟。宣傳方面，則唯恐不及，送免票，請吃飯，更有幾位坤角，爲了希望聽衆多吹多捧，不惜事以父禮。乾女兒的事，豈有不盡心盡力之理，於是送花籃，上繡幔，吟詩結社，其盛况初不亞於一班遺老名士狂捧四大名旦。</p>
<p>可惜好景不常，若干坤角經人一一，趁紅的當兒，周碧雲，秋雲艷等嫁人隱去，劉琴心，姜雲霞等開碼頭搭班，張文娟樂弟等北上訪帥深造。「千夫易集，一將難求，台柱既散，情况就此悽慘不堪。二年前，時代首先關鬥，繼之長樂改演越劇，素以　出噱頭的小廣寒，也奄奄　無生氣。</p>
<p>廿年歌塲，已歷三變，由純粹淸唱改爲任客　唱。一變。由任客點唱進而爲　演，二變。新與的歌塲，以後將否增加表演不可知，目前都以點唱爲主，所和以前不同者，歌女於被點唱之後，有侍坐的義務，是爲三變。</p>
<p>歌塲點戲，在歌女視爲出風頭，在點劇者本人則爲捧塲，或另　目的。小廣寒與盛時代，點戲每齣一元，和目前同價，但看客出手，大抵一齣居多數，於來　風氣漸漸極於奢靡，也多至半打一打而已。民國二十四年，某將軍以名將姿態，盤桓滬上，偶臨小廣寒，經同在友人慫恿，點小小玲瓏十打，當時目爲空前闊綽之舉，今日視之，直起碼之至耳。高樂開慕第三日，記者偕友隨喜，扶梯半腰，閃以歌女　　小姐，此人以爽辣聞名，闢口便是：「喂！小潘，黃頭限嘸沒，幫幫忙好　！」因係舊識，自然義不容辭，好的，五打怎樣？自忖五打便是六十元，在記者已認爲相當豪華了。誰知跨進塲子，不斷聽塲務員報告某先生點某小姐百打，某某點某某二百打，五十打，三十打的，巳不復引人注意。記者汗顏，自慚寒酸，蓋敗年之隔，不圖變本加厲如此！</p>
<p>據熟悉生意經絡者言：歌塲在這一時，利潤着實可觀，普通約化資本十萬至二十五萬，茶賬三元，足以抵銷大部開支，點戲的拆賬，便是純益，他們是這樣分配，點戲一打十二元，歌女得六元，老闆得三元，塲面樂隊得二元，茶房雜業得一元。試以日夜兩塲，點戲通扯二千打爲準，老闆每大可賺六千元，一月十八萬，即使打一對折大抵二三個月，資本便收回了。</p>
<p>有人懷疑這種繁榮情形，究竟能否持久？這點記者有如下的視察，點戲收入不大　得住，上海人白相門檻很精，一時拚命點戲的人，大抵含有月的，經過相當時日，一定會覺悟這種二作的報效方式，太不經濟（看客出錢一元，歌女到手五角），這和舞塲，買票坐　則一原理，而舞塲由極盛趨於衰弱，正可爲歌塲殷鑑。所以歌　不欲樹立不敗之基則已；欲立不敗之基，該還是淸唱及設備方面拉住顧客。平心而論，新興幾家歌塲，歌女人選，雖不乏上乘之姝，然一般陣容仍嫌脆弱，因此，記者的意見，歌塲當局今後最急之務，在於物色或訓練歌女人才。至於設備及招待二事，目前顯然遠勝過去，這是一種進步，不容抹煞。（勤孟）</p>

<p>— 思奈</p>
<p>立秋以來，天氣漸漸轉凉，大家彷彿透過一口氣來，但却不能忽略了還有「秋老虎。</p>
<p>秋老虎也許比夏天更厲害，白天亢熱，夜裏風凉，冷暖不勻，最易生病。</p>
<p>有時候再來一陣秋風秋雨，大家受累，人人愁煞，苦旱災將成，一旦靑黃不接，那末更有倒楣的事臨到頭上，寗可不懼！</p>
<p>有人仍當是和夏天一樣，渾渾噩噩，事情不高興做，美名謂天氣還熱，冷飲物大吃特吃，還要舒舒服服的享受快樂，殊不知秋不勤作，冬無儲糧，一切霍亂疫癘，在秋天更是鬧得兇，這樣糊塗下去，到後來定會噬臍莫及。</p>
<p>秋天蕭瑟，善自珍重！</p>
<h3 id="c61">在疫浪中 <a href="#c61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— 風馬牛</p>
<p>「呀！隔壁饅頭店的夥計早幾個鐘頭還是新鮮活跳的，一下子就沒了，一陣肚子痛，便送掉命，不曉得又吃壞了甚麽東西？」</p>
<p>「嗯，現在吃東西眞嬰當心，一個朋友的親戚在點心店裏吃了一碗炸醬肉麵，回來馬上一命歸天！」</p>
<p>「就是酒席也難吃，那些肉哩蝦哩又不知道浸在冰箱裏多少時候？」</p>
<p>在這狹隘人多的里弄，一到晚上，便頓時熱閙起來，雖然並不見有凉風習習而來，但是究竟比自已居住的擱樓，灶披間，寬敞多多，而且人是有着凑閙忙的脾氣，誰不高興天南地北東拉西扯與鄰舍瞎談呢，於是里弄大有客滿之勢：這幾天，大約因了全市閙疫癘的緣故，因之大家的話題也不免拉到這問題上面。</p>
<p>喬師母也是參與談話者之一，但她却不像人們談過一泡便像一陣風一般的吹過就算數，她在別人由疫癘的問題轉在梅蘭芳是不是登台的話題上，心裏仍躺着一塊大石，這石頭是虎疫，下面好像壓了她的三個孩子，還有她的那瘦瘦的喬先生。</p>
<p>「假如碰到了毛病那眞不得了！」喬師母担着心。她不由自己對自己說：「從明天起，對於食物及其他方面得撤底淸潔一下子。」</p>
<p>到了明天，喬師母的第二個孩子已是嚷着她娘買早點吃了，可是今天喬師母板起臉說：「街門口大餅油條不乾凈，今天起，不准再吃了…」照例，喬師母一屋爲了省煤球，早上是不生爐子的，買點心吃，而點心又是大餅饅頭一套，現在「命令」不准吃，不用小孩子哭哭吵吵，就是要趕「　非司」的喬先生也皺起了臉：「吃甚麼呢？煮粥吧，米又不雊，還得小菜，茶室裏去吃，叉燒包一塊多兩個，又吃不飽！」結果，說呀說的，使喬師母左右做人難了，本來呢，不吃大餅又吃甚麽，先買來吃了再想辦法。喬先生上「　非司」，向來是安步當車，飯在辦公的地方吃：這却使喬師母又不放心，第一，大熱天冒了太陽走，瘦瘦的喬先生吃不消；第二，職員吃的包飯大多既不衛生叉少營養，於是善意的勸喬先生，喬先生却斜了斜那爲生活折駝的背脊，輕蔑他太太的「婦人之見：首先坐電車坐人力車的價錢嚇煞人，半塊到三元不等，至於包飯，不吃他，叉吃甚麼，現在塞够肚算了，還談甚麽衞生！」</p>
<p>喬師母被澳了冷水。一想丈大既不聽忠告，那麽爲孩子淸想吧，於是對喬先生說：「你到大馬路去　一磅餅乾吧，免得小孩吃不乾凈的點心，毛毛呢，也實在瘦得很，別志記給他帶點魚肝油丸子。」</p>
<p>喬先生沒有回答，戴了草帽出去了。</p>
<p>孩子們一點不安靜，嚷着熱，一早便在外面奔，衖裏又臭得很，孩子們倒偏愛在垃圾堆上捉迷藏，這使喬師母張起喉嚨叫：「進來進來！衖堂裏不乾凈！可是外面兩個孩子沒進來，裏面睡着的毛毛却「哇」的一聲大哭，喬師母走進這裝着「熱水汀的房間，毛毛手指着腿喊媽，「虫！虫！」原來毛毛的小腿上被臭虫咬上紅紅的一大塊。亭子叫像打鐵店，毛毛便像塊烙鐵，身上是痱子，瘡癤，蚊虫叮咬的傷痕。</p>
<p>喬師母安排好毛毛，又上小菜塲，回來忙着切洗燒煮，廚房裏更熱，喬師母頭昏得緊，胸口要發嘔，趕忙灌了兩瓶痧藥水。</p>
<p>到了黃昏，喬先生回來了，喬師母瞪着眼問：餅乾呢？」喬先生手一攤：好了，要十多塊一磅，這月份的薪水沒有拿，這星期的麵粉還沒買呢！」</p>
<p>這時，兩個大孩子手裏拿着紅色的冰凍甚麼糕吃，喬師母沒有饗，她想：「我們這種人談甚麽衛生，營養！」疫癘雖似塊大石，但喬師母覺得要落下來也只有「聽天由命」了！</p>

<p>— 文奎</p>
<p>在大我」中有着一個無足道的十七歲的一小我」，他是江蘇寶山縣人，生於貧窮之家，有着一付瞧不起人的窮骨頭，「文奎」這名字對他是千萬分的不適合，但易於被人家認識或辨別起見，在小學中被吳先生題下了，他也就便當了他的名字；若無人替他題名時，無論那一個數目字是再也好不過的。他生來就喜歡隨便，是一個十足多血啠的典型。他情願被人打，而若被人駡了，他就死也不肯干休，而他自己却喜歡駡人，佔小便宣是地的拿手好戲，無論那一件事可以看出來：他隨便借人家的東西，而不還；他自己所有的，却盡推諉不借。但他發表起人生觀來，說着：「生不帶來，死不帶去」的妙論，而你們的就是我的，我的却是我的，不能拿的。他常常說有錢人的勢利，在他自己親戚中盡多着從前窮而現在富的，一切對窮人的設施，使他氣得大發牢騐：「這種忘恩負義的小人，從前還是我提拔起來的，現在就像煞有價事，反臉不認人，報應有一天會到臨的，那時候，我可以出氣。」道種幸災樂禍的聲調，時常從他口裏發出來。有時他會說：「假使我有了錢，我如何如何…………其實即使他有了全世界，恐怕要勢利到極點。有朋友成功了，不論是努力或幸運得來的，他由羨慕變爲妒忌，甚至想着惡意的法子去破壞。自己呢，幻想著成功，他以爲成功託於天命，只耍運氣好，沒有不成功的，所以他一天到晚坐在家裏，等候運氣的來到，除了一天三頓外，從來甚麽事都不做的。有朋友墮落，他是多快樂呀，面子上勸導人家如何上進，實際上，他想他爲何不做叫化子呢。他曉得自己有着許多缺點，他用各種計劃改進，而不肯實行，即使實行了，不知不覺地仍是明知故犯，而別人却當他是一個大大了不起的人物。</p>
<p>在世界每個角落裏，尤其是都市，儘多着他一樣的人，但他是生來如此的嗎？不，絕對不！他是被薰陶的，在世界上沒有他這種典型人時候，就是天下淸靜的時候。</p>

<p>— 愚</p>
<p>大學　初中小學工商補習各組申請助學諸生，經過甄別試騐及約談審查等手續，現已核准陸續發表，在獲得助金諸生，承各界的捐輸，得以繼續求學，經濟上的援助，略告段落。可是我們認爲除了諸生所迫切需要的經濟援助而外，精神上的修養，學問上的切磋，也是諸生爲學的根本問題，解決了入學的困難，這是獲得求學的機會，至於學業有成　當然是諸生所自勉，也就是捐輸者的期望。</p>
<p>這裏我們基於親切的精神，願與獲助諸同學提出幾點來談談求學態度。</p>
<p>左宗棠說：「人生讀書得力，祇有數年，十六以前，知織未開，二十五六以後，人事漸雜，此數年中放過，則無成矣。」這是頗足警惕我們的幾句話。我們要愛惜時間，專心致志，我們如何能够絲毫不放鬆於我們得來不易的這個求學機會，將來我們縱使有力就學，可是再不能得到道個相當年齡的苦學機會，此其一。</p>
<p>曾國藩說：「用功譬若掘井，與其多掘救井，而皆不及泉，何若老守一井，力求及泉，而用之不竭乎！就現在學校的普通課目言，這是人人應有的常識，當然不是希望諸同學專習一科之調。可是鑒如工商從業員中，有不少同學，一人請求學習幾科，論他的勇於爲學，自屬可嘉，可是爲求切於實用和學習成果，我們覺得還是分期專修爲容易獲取效果，此其二。</p>
<p>朱子說：「爲學醫如熬肉，先須用猛火煮，然後用慢火溫。」這是自己謹嚴管理的經騐之言。柳玭家訓也說：「修己不得不懇？爲學不得不堅。」自來學業有成的人，沒有不是從刻苦力學中得來，此其三。</p>
<p>當然先賢對於爲學之道，儘有不少嘉言，足爲諸同學楷模，今僅提出一些鱗爪，或爲諸同學所習聞，所望諸同學深誌「今之學者爲人」的話，在這求學的過程中，靜以修身，摒絕習氣，學問所以求知，求知所以致用，今日獲助的同學，將來終必是社會的幹材，這是我們的願望。</p>

<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（八）　奈若何</p>
<p>這實在太値得驚奇了。葉二太太怕自己的聽覺不甚靈敏，張了嘴問道：「你說什麽？她問了還是張了嘴等何子興回答。何子興道：少爺和阿興，都沒有在陳家，一何子興已經是重言以申明之了，申明他第一遍告訴葉二太太的，和第二遍是並沒有兩樣。翠珍也急起來道：何子興，你別是走錯了人家，也許雙橋鎭上，有好多姓陳的人家，你去問的，不是少爺去的一家。這陳家門前，有一棵大楡樹；離開陳家不多幾家，有一家是黑牆鬥；他們的房子，屋　是小怎麽高的，是舊式房子：他那祖奶奶，歡喜唸經，年紀很大了。你去問的，是不是這一家呢？何子興道：「怎麼會不是？是的，我雖然不識字，這些都識的。二太太，外邊冷，還是到裏邊去說話。」</p>
<p>葉二太太移步到裏邊，在不亮不暗的暮色裏，何子興把脚上的草鞋，脫在天井裹，赤了脚，走進廂屋裏，說道：「陳家在　橋鎭上，門口有株大樹，是不是楡樹，我倒沒留神，我一些沒弄錯。陳家的老太太，親口對我說：我們少爺是昨天在他們家裏吃了飯才走的，阿興也在他們家裏吃的飯。葉二太太和翠珍，不約而同說道：何子興，你訓話怎麽這樣的，一會兒說少爺沒有在陳家，一會兒又說少爺在陳家吃飯？何干興道：我沒說錯，少爺和阿興在陳家吃飯，是昨天的事；今天我到陳家，少爺和阿興，是都沒有在陳家。葉二太太和翠珍，都拍了拍胸脯，是壓驚的意思；一邊也是有些放心了。她們聽何子興說下去，才明白：維城全僕倆，昨天淸早，冒雷到了陳家，陳國器都沒在家，維城主俟，就從雙橋直接到了上海，多半還是訪問陳國器兄妹去的。（一五四）</p>

<p>然而也還有値得商榷的地方，那就是把人類分爲兩種：忙人和閒人。前者包括敎員，發生，公司職員……；後者則爲流氓乞丐之類，而演講者所希望於聽衆和讀者的是學做忙人。</p>
<p>我以爲要注意的是：忙人不就是「好人」，或「社會的建設者」。儘管他們終日熙熙攘攘，多半還是爲著自私自利出發；即或他們偶有所獲，因而賺得了各色各樣看來似很體面的頭銜，但於社會何補呢？</p>
<p>至於流氓乞丐之類，雖已不齒於人羣，但也爲不艮針會下的必然產物，　之旦閒人，似太不稱；有錢斯有閒」，理至淺明。撤開燈紅紙綠，醇酒婦人的有閒階級不說，而歸罪被擯於職業圈外求生不遑的乞丐們，未免有失公正。</p>
<p>忙興閒之含義既未肯定，則用以爲劃分人類的尺度自也靠不住了。</p>
<p>但「一寸光陰一寸金」，不讓每一寸光陰很費，以致力於人類社會的福利工作，蓋是每一個求進取的人士的責任。</p>
<p>所謂「忙」－－應該是緊張地工作。</p>
<p>而「閒」－－則無與消極的等死！</p>
<h3 id="c66">穿舊衣的哲學 <a href="#c66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— 葛亮</p>
<p>穿舊衣服也有哲學嗎？有！當然有！</p>
<p>假使你穿了舊長衫破皮鞋，走在路上，當別人向你的長衫或皮鞋瞧着的時候，便立刻覺得羞澀，立刻感到慚愧，或則甚至於險紅耳赤了；那就是缺乏舊衣服的哲學」的常識。</p>
<p>然而，若是閣下想添置一件新裝，那倒也不錯。可是踏進了布店，不由你不望着價目吐舌，不由你不對着質料皺眉。再退一步說，裁縫帥父處不去　敎，遊（？）子身上衣就去恭請慈母手中線吧，但是，單就買針和綫的錢，巳够以前一件新布褂。</p>
<p>穿舊衣的哲學是這樣的：假使有人注意你的破皮鞋，那沒有關係，儘可不必難爲情。醫如你穿了最時髦，最漂亮，最新式，最摩登，最美觀的新皮鞋在路上走，當然也會惹起別人注意的。那時你的感覺怎樣？大概總不外乎是愉快的吧！既然如此，同樣被人所注意，爲何前者要侷促不安，後者要趾高氣揚呢！所以不妨把脚蹺得高一些，將破皮鞋炫耀一下，讓他人去欣賞欣賞好了。</p>
<p>相知者貴知乎心，若是相知者僅知乎衣。看見你的一行頭一不「吃價」，因此不招呼你，那不妨，隨他去好了，消極方面的應付，就是置之坦然，不和我交談也省得我背誦三十六名敷衍客套了；積極方面的措置，他輕視我的衣衫，我輕視他的勢利，哼，來而不往非禮也！</p>
<p>這個年頭兒，不對他人的新裝羨慕，嫉妒更可以不必有，也小用對自己的破衣羞澀，至於慚愧，簡直不應該有。因爲無論阿狗，阿貓，推小車的，或是拉洋車的，一旦發了財，就打扮得風度翩翩，風雅得使詩人騷客望塵莫及，使儒者文士退避三舍，那麼，反而言之，在這個亂世，難道我們不應該穿舊長衫破皮鞋嗎？那豈不是太……太有些那個了，是嗎？</p>

<h3 id="e1">Bombay Chamber of Commerce Asks the Viceroy to Reopen Negotiations with Gandhi; Rumors of New Proposals from the United States; Severe Situation Unabated in Various Parts of India <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Xiongcheng (presumably a misspelling of 熊城 or 雄城 which is an old name of New York city) 13th, Allied News Agency Electricity - According to sources in Bombay, the Bombay Indian Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the British Governor-General today, urging him to reopen negotiations with Gandhi. The telegram suggested that negotiations should start from the point where the talks with Cripps broke down, and that Gandhi and the Governor-General should have the convenience of exchanging drafts to gather opinions from all parties and achieve a peaceful resolution.</p>
<p>Bangkok, 13th, Haitong News Agency Electricity - In view of the increasingly chaotic situation in India, the Bombay Chamber of Commerce has asked the Governor-General of India to begin negotiations with Gandhi in the hope of averting a crisis.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 13th, Haitong News Agency Electricity - According to a report from the London correspondent of a local evening newspaper, although Britain is trying to localize the Indian riots, the rebellion is about to spread across the country. The enthusiasm of the Indian people has reached its peak, and the situation is extremely chaotic. The United States is now working on new proposals in the hope of resolving the Indian issue before the situation becomes uncontrollable, but it seems unlikely that Britain will accept them. The British authorities are maintaining silence on this matter.</p>
<p>Cairo, 12th, Havas News Agency Electricity - The well-known newspaper "Al-Ahram" recently published an article stating that the Egyptian Prime Minister, Nahas Pasha, attempted to mediate between Britain and India, but to no avail. It is known that Nahas is a close friend of Nehru, the leader of the Indian National Congress, and has repeatedly urged Nehru to change his course and adopt a more moderate attitude. Unfortunately, there is currently no room for compromise between the Congress Party and the Governor-General of India, and his efforts were ultimately futile.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 13th, Allied News Agency Electricity - The anti-British struggle in India has caused great concern among the American people. What the United States is currently worried about is that the struggle in India will greatly harm India's contribution to the Allied war effort, especially its production capacity. A mediation by the United States between the Governor-General's office and the Congress Party might have been possible in the past, but now that Gandhi and others have been arrested, it has become an internal affair. Therefore, the United States has no room for mediation. However, some people say that Roosevelt will personally write to Gandhi, asking him to stop the non-cooperation movement. In addition, former US special envoy to India, Grady, reported to Roosevelt on the industrialization of India, saying that it was very promising and that it had a considerable capacity for weapons production. Therefore, India could make a greater contribution to the Allied war effort in the future. However, the occurrence of this incident will inevitably reduce India's productivity, which is what the United States is most concerned about.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 13th, Havas News Agency Electricity - British officials recently announced that the whole city was peaceful this morning and no new incidents had occurred. A small number of small shops in the old city have reopened. The Governor-General's Office is now trying to get other grocery stores selling daily necessities to reopen. The military and police are able to control the overall situation.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th, Haitong News Agency Electricity - According to news from Washington, the US State Department stated last night that the US military's entry into India is to fight against the Axis powers. Therefore, the US military has been ordered not to interfere in the riots in India. The US military is in India to protect India, but if there are disturbances in the US military's defense zone, the US military can take necessary measures to defend itself and protect American citizens.</p>
<p>Riots Continue to Occur</p>
<p>Bern, 12th, Havas News Agency Electricity - According to news received from India, the Indian people took to the streets again today to hold demonstrations. Clashes between the people and the police continued to occur. The situation in various places is summarized as follows: In Bombay, the crowd attacked a police patrol, and the police were forced to open fire to suppress them. Fortunately, there were no casualties. In a certain district, the police stopped the people from demonstrating, and the people attacked troop carriers with stones. The police had to open fire again to deter them. According to official reports, there were some casualties. In addition, a large number of people surrounded the post office. The police drove there and opened fire, dispersing the crowd. One hundred and fifty rioters were arrested on the spot. The telegraph and telephone lines in the northern suburbs of Bombay were cut off and were only repaired after several hours. In New Delhi, the banks remained closed today because the people were holding demonstrations. When the people attacked the post office, the police opened fire to disperse them, killing one civilian and injuring one. In a certain place, someone on the roof attacked the police representatives with stones, and the police immediately opened fire on them. Fortunately, there were no deaths. The military patrolled the residential areas day and night. Riots broke out in various parts of Delhi. The police opened fire to suppress them. The shops in the city remained closed. Heavy troops and police were stationed in the suburbs to prevent accidents. The authorities have not yet released a list of civilian casualties, only stating that several people were killed or injured in Bombay and at least twelve people were killed in Delhi. The British authorities have taken further measures to cope with the current situation. Both Sindh and Bombay provinces have declared a state of emergency. Anyone who commits arson or vandalism will be punished with flogging, and a curfew will be imposed at night. Those who privately possess weapons will also be severely punished.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th, Allied News Agency Electricity - The fighting situation in various parts of India is becoming more and more intense. Conflicts between Indian people and the police have occurred one after another, resulting in many casualties. The strikes and work stoppages in important industrial cities such as Bombay and Calcutta are expanding, which greatly affects India's wartime production. According to Reuters, many factories in India have been shut down due to worker strikes. The fighting among Indians seems to be the fiercest in the capital, New Delhi. On the 12th, the National People's Assembly Hall was set on fire by the crowd. The situation in the city is extremely chaotic. Two banks were also closed on the 11th. The bank committees are currently discussing countermeasures. When the people attacked the post office, they moved the stamps, postcards, and other mails out and threw them into the fire on the street. In addition, they attacked the railway and the tax office, etc., and clashed with the police, killing at least thirty-five people and injuring hundreds. The British authorities believe that Congress Party members are secretly active in the city, which may make the situation more serious. They have ordered citizens to stay indoors. As for the town of Pune in Bombay Province, the people attacked six police stations. The police immediately opened fire, injuring two people. The British authorities have ordered the arrest of rioters throughout Bombay Province, and 400 people have already been arrested. In the city of Lucknow, United Province, a group of university students attacked the railway station and destroyed the ticket office, but were stopped by the police. Anti-British incidents have occurred in countless other places. Although the British Indian authorities have always tried their best to suppress them, they have not achieved any effect.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 12th, Allied News Agency Electricity - According to news from New Delhi, the anti-British struggle in various parts of India is intensifying. The Governor-General of India has issued a proclamation stating that offenders will be punished immediately after being caught and that the military is officially authorized to open fire to defend its own safety. According to official announcements, as of now, a total of thirty-one Indian people have been killed, 250 injured, and about 500 arrested. In reality, the number may be higher.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 12th, Allied News Agency Electricity - According to a New Delhi dispatch, British military police continued to arrest five Congress Party leaders in Calcutta.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 13th, Haitong News Agency Electricity - Although the London news received here last night claimed that the news about the Indian riots was mostly exaggerated, the news from Britain, even from the British side, unanimously acknowledged that the situation in Delhi and Patna has become more serious in the past twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>Saigon, 13th, Haitong News Agency Electricity - Recent dispatches from New Delhi state that the Indian riots are spreading and there are constant occurrences of stoning, arson, and strikes, as well as attacks on individuals and police vehicles. The face of New Delhi has completely changed. Shops are closed all day, and military police patrol the entire city. Several districts in the city are closed off, and pedestrians and vehicles are prohibited from passing through. Since the crowds set fire to the municipal office, the railway bureau, the clock tower, trams, and military vehicles, the military's vigilance has become even more intense.</p>
<h3 id="e2">British India Office Releases Statement on Indian Situation; Confirms Order is Seriously Chaotic in Various Locations but Claims the Government is in Control of the Overall Situation <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>London, 12th, Havas News Agency Electricity - The India Office issued a communiqué this morning stating that "the government is able to control the overall situation in India." At the same time, Reuters announced that the backlash from the initial measures taken by the Governor-General of India was not as serious as initially expected. Although it is true that various serious incidents have occurred throughout India, their scope is limited to major cities, especially Bombay, Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Pune, Delhi, and Kanpur. Disturbances in other industrial areas are also expected. The good order maintained in Punjab, Bengal, Bihar, and Madras is a good sign. In short, the situation in India is changing rapidly every day, and it is impossible to make a final judgment. But no matter how chaotic the order is, the government is able to control the overall situation.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th, Allied News Agency Electricity - According to news from London, the British Indian Affairs Officer issued a statement yesterday, stating that India has been properly controlled and denying any complex situation of bloodshed. The demonstrations are only intermittent and are caused by rioters and radical students. He also said that the claim that "chaos is spreading throughout India" is completely unfounded. The so-called intermittent demonstrations have been confirmed by the latest official news from India.</p>
<p>Berlin Political Circles</p>
<p>Closely Monitor</p>
<p>Bern, 12th, Havas News Agency Electricity - The "Basel News" today published a report from Berlin correspondent Ray stating that German political figures are closely monitoring the events in India. According to German experts on Indian issues, the majority of the Indian people support Mahatma Gandhi and the National Congress Party, which can be corroborated by various news reports received. The entire country of India is currently engaged in passive resistance, strikes, and sabotage. These actions first occurred in major cities and have now spread to various provinces. The evolution of the political situation in India will have a very serious impact on Britain's defensive position, but it is still difficult to make wild guesses at this time. In any case, the importance of the Indian incident is felt far beyond India, which can be asserted.</p>
<p>Alliance in the United States</p>
<p>Issues Statement</p>
<p>Lisbon, 12th, Allied News Agency Electricity - According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington, the Indian Alliance in the United States held an emergency meeting on the 12th and issued a statement on the British authorities' illegal arrest of Gandhi, Nehru, Acharya, and other Indian leaders, as follows: Britain is using suppressive measures to suppress the Indian people's demand for freedom. This move makes Britain permanently abandon the only hope of resolving India. A tragic struggle has already begun, which is the inevitable result of Cripps's failure. The current crisis between Britain and India indicates that the British government cannot change its centuries-old imperialist policy.</p>
<p>Manila, 13th, Allied News Agency Electricity - Swani, the director of the Philippine branch of the Indian Independence League, gave a broadcast speech here last night, calling on the Indian people to rise up in time to fight for freedom.</p>
<p>Nanjing Central Political Conference</p>
<p>Nanjing, 13th, Central News Agency Electricity - The Central Political Committee held its 105th meeting at 9:00 a.m. on the 13th. Chairman Wang Zhaoming presided over the meeting. The chairman submitted for discussion a proposal from the Executive Yuan to specially appoint Wu Songgao as Ambassador Plenipotentiary to work in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

<p>Zhejiang Japanese Army Front Line, 13th, Allied News Agency Electricity - According to an announcement from the Japanese army front line on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway today, the Japanese army launched a new offensive on the 9th of this month, concentrating infantry units in Guangxin (i.e., Shangrao) and Changshan along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. The Japanese troops stationed in Guangxin and north of Changshan attacked northward on the evening of the 9th. Part of the defending 146th Division was repelled by the Japanese 20 kilometers northwest of Badujie. At the same time, other Japanese infantry units advancing from Changshan repelled eight hundred defending soldiers in the mountainous area 20 kilometers northeast of Huabu and northwest of Changshan.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 13th, Allied News Agency Electricity - According to naval sources, the Japanese General Headquarters originally planned to announce the details of the Solomon Islands campaign this afternoon, but it has been postponed. However, it may be announced tomorrow.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th, Allied News Agency Electricity - According to news from Washington, President Roosevelt convened a Pacific military conference yesterday, presumably based on the latest information received, to discuss the Solomon Islands campaign. This meeting is held once a week, but it was not held last week due to the President's busy schedule.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 12th, Allied News Agency Electricity - According to news from Washington, Roosevelt convened a Pacific military conference at the White House on the 12th to discuss important current issues. Reuters reported that the meeting focused on reviewing the news of the Solomon Islands naval battle. The United States initially only announced that the battle was still in progress. The Navy Department subsequently announced on the 10th that it had not yet received detailed reports, and the situation was unclear. It also stated that US destroyers, cruisers, and transport ships had been sunk or damaged. However, neutral parties believe that this announcement is pessimistic news from the United States. Apart from reviewing the Solomon Islands naval battle, there were no specific reports on the results of the Pacific military conference. This may reflect the unfavorable battle situation.</p>
<p>Saigon, 13th, Haitong News Agency Electricity - Although the Allied propaganda still claims that the Allied forces are making smooth progress in the Solomon Islands naval battle, Australian officials are warning people not to be optimistic, as the losses suffered may be greater than expected.</p>

<p>Saigon, 13th, Haitong News Agency Electricity - A Sydney dispatch states that the Allied forces in Australia have now formulated a thorough plan to exchange US and Australian staff officers, so that the staff officers of both countries can mutually understand each other's war organization and strategy. At the same time, some US military personnel will be trained in Australian schools.</p>
<p>Saigon, 13th, Haitong News Agency Electricity - Australian Prime Minister Curtin said in a speech at the centenary banquet of the Melbourne City Council, "No one of the Allied countries can stand alone. The various dangers of future victory must be shared equally by the Allied countries. Whether the hopes for the next century can be realized or diminished will depend on how the countries leading us in the war distribute their tasks. The US, Britain, China, the Soviet Union, and other autonomous territories are deeply aware of Australia's situation, and the Australian government is also deeply aware of the situation of other Allied countries. Australia and New Zealand have now become fortresses that the Allied countries cannot abandon. I firmly believe that the leaders of Britain and the United States feel the same as I do."</p>
<p>Bilbao, 12th, Havas News Agency Electricity - Australian newspapers, especially those in Sydney, have unanimously protested against the government's news censorship measures. Today, the newspapers published an article written by former Prime Minister Hughes, attacking the government for publishing false reports on the development of the Pacific war situation. Prime Minister Curtin recently issued a statement refuting it, stating, "Australian news censorship never censors political news. As for other issues, especially news involving military issues, the news censor must decide whether to publish them."</p>
<h3 id="e6">Recent Situation in Medan <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Medan, 13th, Allied News Agency Electricity - Medan is the only large city in northern Sumatra. Every day, at dawn, the public market in the city center is crowded with people who begin to buy and sell. The market is 33 meters wide and 160 meters long. The size of the scale is imaginable. The items in the market are all kinds of vegetables. In addition to fish, meat, tomatoes, and cucumbers, there are also many foods unique to Southeast Asia. The smell of coconut oil on the indigenous residents is difficult for newcomers to get used to. At the same time, the noisy shouts often cause headaches. However, the exchange of these sounds and smells is precisely the driving force for building a new Medan. Jalan Mojong, the commercial center of the city, is lined with shops of all sizes. The colorful clothing materials are especially eye-catching. The overseas Chinese live in the southern part of the city. They work hard in business, but since the merger and unification of various small-scale overseas Chinese associations, the 35,000 overseas Chinese in the city also have the need to improve their lives. At the same time, they can also actively cooperate in the construction of Medan.</p>

<h3 id="e13">The Siege of Tuapse Begins; The Black Sea Coast Becomes a Fiery Pit; There is No Decisive Victory in the Don Bend; The Soviet Offensive in the Kerch Peninsula Expands <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet Border, Havas, 12th: The 415th day of the war on the Eastern Front. German forces are advancing towards the Black Sea coast, aiming for Tuapse and Novorossiysk. South of Melitopol, the Red Army continues to retreat towards Tuapse, but the German forces are very close to the city, and the siege has already begun. In Krasnodar, the German forces encountered fierce resistance from the Red Army. The Red Army is clearly determined to defend Novorossiysk at a heavy price. So far, the Red Army's strategy has been to delay time, with its rearguard sacrificing itself in covering battles to consolidate the road to Novorossiysk. At the same time, the hard-pressed defenders of western Caucasus are embarking and retreating southward. In fact, this retreat is taking place in every port along the Black Sea coast, with all ships, large and small, being used up. The German air force is constantly bombing Red Army units and various ports where they are embarking for retreat. The Black Sea coast has become a fiery pit, with the Red Army suffering heavy losses under the bombing. The situation in the Pyatigorsk region is unclear, but there are reasons to believe that the German forces are taking advantage of the terrain to advance rapidly towards the Caspian Sea coast. According to Italian sources, the oil refining facilities in the Grozny region, on the German offensive route, have been set ablaze by the Red Army. On the Stalingrad front, although the German forces are making a full-scale advance in the Don River bend area, there has been no decisive victory. The German forces are attacking this fortress in three routes, attempting to combine frontal attacks with encirclement tactics along the Volga River. It is noteworthy that a piece of land between the Don River bend and the Volga River was cultivated by farmers this year, indicating that the highest authorities of the Red Army had anticipated that this area would become a battlefield since last winter. At the same time, the view that the Red Army is sacrificing the defense of the Caucasus in order to consolidate the defensive center of Stalingrad has also been confirmed. The Red Army's offensive in the Kerch Peninsula has expanded and has the appearance of a counter-offensive. The Red Army is constantly sending fresh troops to open a gap in the German positions and force the Germans to transfer troops from the southern route to aid. However, the German forces are still able to control the overall situation.</p>
<p>Headquarters of the German Leader, 13th, Havas News Agency: The German military report this afternoon stated that German and friendly forces are pressing the retreating enemy forces in the Caucasus region. A large Soviet force was annihilated yesterday. The German mechanized units north of the Manych River are making rapid progress, occupying the city of Elista, the capital of the Kalmyk region. German aircraft also attacked ships in northern Caucasus and the Kerch Strait. Three coastal ships were sunk, and three ships were hit and caught fire. Between the Volga and Don Rivers, the German-Romanian allied forces fiercely attacked the enemy's strongholds and made further progress. The Soviet air force attempted to attack German airfields and had twenty-eight planes shot down. The fighting in the Voronezh region has intensified. Enemy reinforcements launched an attack with large tank formations. Our troops bravely countered the attack. German aircraft carried out heavy bombing, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy, who retreated without success. On August 11th and 12th, 234 enemy tanks were destroyed. Southeast and north of Kerch, enemy forces attacked our positions. Our infantry and armored units calmly countered the attack. Yesterday, 71 enemy tanks were destroyed.</p>
<p>Germany Will Launch a Pincer Attack on Stalingrad, Berlin, 13th, Havas News Agency: The German command reported yesterday that the Soviet 62nd Army and a part of the Soviet 1st Army were encircled west of Kalach-na-Donu in the Don River basin. Therefore, the German forces that were previously operating west of Kalach can now be transferred elsewhere. The Soviet forces should now know that the temporary halt of German operations in the Don River basin is not due to the effectiveness of the Soviet resistance, but due to the strategy of the German command. The crisis in Stalingrad is becoming increasingly acute. The Don River is the last defensive line for the German advance towards the city. Another part of the German forces advancing south of the Don River is located south of Stalingrad and will launch a new offensive against the city. Therefore, it is expected that when the German forces launch a general offensive on Stalingrad, they will launch a pincer attack at several points simultaneously. After the Soviet forces encircled west of Kalach were annihilated, the remaining Soviet strength in the Don River basin is weak and insufficient to prevent the German forces from operating in the area. Military circles in Berlin pointed out that the number of prisoners captured in the battle west of Kalach is not proportional to the spoils seized, suggesting that the Soviet forces are fighting to the death on Stalin's orders. The heavy losses of Soviet war equipment are making the defense of Stalingrad increasingly difficult. German forces on the Caucasus front have advanced to a vast mountain range. The vanguard of the German forces in western Caucasus is advancing south in the villages at the foot of the Caucasus Mountains. The German military authorities do not disclose the current position of the army to avoid divulging military secrets to the enemy. Therefore, the news that the current fighting is for control of the key passes in the southern foothills of the Caucasus Mountains is neither confirmed nor denied by Berlin. According to the latest news received here, the German forces in the central Caucasus front have entered the Caucasus and are now advancing towards the Elbrus Mountains. The highest peak of the mountain range, Mount Elbrus, reaches a height of 18,600 feet. The German forces advancing eastward in northern Caucasus are making rapid progress. Their vanguard has reached the city of Talek River district, and the upper reaches of the Kuma River have also become a war zone. It is also reported that the area around Lake Manych has been crossed by German forces, and the army has now entered the Kalmyk Republic region. It is believed here that the Soviet claim that the Soviet forces are making an orderly retreat in northern Caucasus to protect Stalingrad and the oil fields of Transcaucasia is completely inaccurate. In addition, the Soviet claim that the retreat of the Soviet forces from northern Caucasus is a strategy of Timoshenko is also unreasonable. Even the most incompetent military strategist like Timoshenko knows that the retreat of the Soviet forces from northern Caucasus would cut off the connection between the Soviet mainland and the Caucasian oil fields.</p>
<p>Stalingrad</p>
<p>Stalingrad is an important Soviet industrial center in the lower reaches of the Volga River. Originally named Tsaritsyn, it was renamed Stalingrad in memory of Stalin's revolutionary achievements in defending the city in 1918. After two five-year plans, machine factories, shipyards, and cotton mills were established one after another. After the revolutionary war, the city was completely transformed, with wide avenues and beautiful parks. In addition to being an industrial center, the city is also a cultural city, with universities, research institutes, theaters, and the Stalin Museum, which houses many valuable historical documents.</p>

<p>Zurich, 13th, Allied News Agency: According to the Swiss Basel News, the Soviet government has requested Yakalin, the new Turkish ambassador to the Soviet Union in Kuibyshev, that the Turkish government allow the Soviet Black Sea Fleet to pass through the Bosphorus Strait to join the Allied forces in the Mediterranean. However, the Turkish government in Ankara may not agree. At the same time, it is also reported that the Turkish authorities have begun to prepare for defense on the Soviet and Iranian borders as a precautionary measure. According to a Berlin dispatch, it is rumored that the British and American ambassadors to Turkey have also strongly demanded that the Turkish government allow the Soviet Black Sea Fleet to pass through the Bosphorus Strait. Therefore, if the Turkish government agrees to this request, it will inevitably cause a serious dispute between Germany and Turkey. The Turkish government is currently dealing with this matter with extreme caution. According to the Ankara dispatch in the Berlin National News of the 13th, it is rumored that the Turkish government will reject this request based on the Montreux Convention. The German government also issued a statement on the 12th, expressing its belief that Turkey will adhere to its neutral policy.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th, Havas News Agency: Semi-official sources here recently released information stating that the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union may have discussed the issue of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet seeking refuge in the Mediterranean. It is rumored that a request will be made to the Turkish government to allow passage through the straits. Turkey, on the other hand, has always maintained a neutral attitude, and there are currently no signs of changing its position.</p>
<p>German Estimates of Soviet Losses</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th, Havas News Agency: Military sources estimate that since the outbreak of the Soviet war, the Soviet Union has lost 100 million people. The number of Soviet soldiers killed, wounded, and captured is estimated to be between 12 million and 14 million. There are also 90 million Soviet people in the German-occupied areas, totaling about 100 million. The area of Soviet land occupied by the German army and its allies is about 1.4 million square kilometers, which is approximately equal to the area of Germany, the United Kingdom, and France combined.</p>
<h3 id="e15">American Political Commentator Assesses the Situation on the Eastern Front <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 13th, Havas News Agency: According to news from New York, Boston radio commentator Hood commented yesterday on the possibility of German forces advancing towards Novorossiysk, the Soviet naval base on the eastern coast of the Black Sea, stating that the situation in the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly critical. The Soviet attempt to use cavalry to contain the advance of German armored forces is a risky experiment. The Soviet forces have concentrated all of their tank forces around Stalingrad. The result of this strategy is that the German forces have an opportunity to threaten the port of Novorossiysk on the Black Sea coast, which is the last good port held by the Soviet forces on the Black Sea coast. If the German forces can consolidate their captured strongholds, they can occupy the Black Sea coast and then advance towards the Caucasus. After that, the German forces can drive straight into Iran, Iraq, and Syria without having to go through Turkey. The German forces can also cross the sea and directly seize the Baku oil fields. The political commentator concluded that the German forces have this possibility. Therefore, the Soviet Union is sparing no effort in demanding that the Allied forces open a second front.</p>

<p>Budapest, 12th, Havas News Agency: The General Command released a military report stating that after a long period of silence, fierce fighting has broken out again on the front held by the Hungarian troops on the Eastern Front. The Red Army launched a fierce attack on our positions under the cover of armored units, but was unsuccessful. The intensity of the fighting is still increasing.</p>
<p>Helsinki, 12th, Havas News Agency: A military report stated that the Red Army launched repeated attacks on the Isthmus of Ounas yesterday, but were repelled by our troops. Both sides' patrols are extremely active. On the southern route of the northern front, our artillery destroyed many enemy bunkers. The Finnish coastal artillery continuously bombarded enemy ships in Kronstadt.</p>
<p>Most of the Serbian Rebels Have Been Eliminated</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th, Havas News Agency: According to sources in German military circles, the suppression of the uprising in the Herzegovina and southern Bosnia regions has been progressing smoothly for several weeks. The German and Croatian forces are advancing systematically, driving the rebels into the Sarajevo region. Some of the rebels fighting in the remote mountainous regions and sparsely populated villages have been encircled and eliminated. Most of the rebels in the deep forests of the south have also been annihilated. A large number of farmers in the area have now moved to the German-occupied areas. A British officer attempting to maintain contact with the rebels was captured in Mostar by anti-communist forces. During the period from July 23 to August 8, 3,000 rebels were annihilated and 9,700 were wounded. Acts of sabotage that hindered the harvest were also detected and stopped early, so the harvest work is now progressing smoothly.</p>
<h3 id="e17">The Issue of Opening a Second Front Attracts Attention in French Political Circles; US Army Department Representative Barnes Arrives in England to Discuss the Adjustment of Military Production Between the Two Countries <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Vichy, 13th, Havas News Agency: The issue of opening a second front in Europe has now attracted attention in French political circles, because American newspapers claim that the second front will be opened in France, so that the French can provide assistance to the landing troops. Political circles here are very disgusted with the American propaganda, spreading rumors to sway the French. One message claims that after the British and American troops land in France, the French government and the French army will maintain neutrality, and that French leader Laval also made this claim. Regarding this matter, the French Foreign Ministry has denied it to the US State Department. The French government has repeatedly declared that France will resist troops that invade its territory, and that those who want to incite rebellion or invade France in French territory will be greatly disappointed. The French army is capable of protecting French territory and suppressing rebellion.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 13th, Havas News Agency: According to news from the Swedish newspaper "War in London", the discussion of opening a second front in Europe has once again gained momentum in the British Isles, but it is being discussed from a negative perspective, such as the issue of ship space requirements. Major General Bowen, a member of the British military delegation to the United States, said that it is better to make Germany yield by intensifying air strikes and blockades than opening a second front. Lord Halifax, a close relative of the British King, and Mr. Asquith also share this view. Lieutenant Colonel Walter, Churchill's private secretary in Parliament, said that the Allied ship losses are more serious than British newspapers admit. The Swedish correspondent believes that, from all aspects, it seems impossible to open a second front this year.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 13th, Havas News Agency: According to news from London, General Barnes, Director of the US Army Department and Deputy Director of the Fire Bureau, has arrived in London and will negotiate with British officials on the adjustment of British and American military production. Many technical personnel have also arrived in England to assist in the negotiations.</p>

<p>Gusben, 13th, Central News Agency: According to a recent telegram from Washington, the US government has announced that it has concluded rubber agreements with the British territories of Trinidad and Guyana. The United States is allowed to purchase all of the rubber produced in the above two places. It is also learned that rubber agreements will soon be concluded with various small countries in Central America. However, the rubber production of various countries in Central America is very small. According to Trinidad and Guyana, the rubber production of these two places is extremely small. The production of the above two places is not seen in any rubber statistics or export trade statistics. However, Guyana only had 168 acres of rubber plantations in 1938. Therefore, the United States' signing of this agreement is just an empty promise.</p>
<h3 id="e24">The History of the Caucasus (III) <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Rather than saying that Bakiyevich was an outstanding soldier, he was more of a great organizer and clever diplomat. It is said that when he was at war with Turkey and good news was constantly being reported, the various northern tribes were quite peaceful. Regardless of the facts, in fact, several years after Bakiyevich returned to Russia in 1829, the fiery hope and faith contained in the Muridism religious movement gradually occupied power underground, and when it actually broke out, it was like a bolt from the blue for Russia! Tsar Nicholas I was a more insightful figure than his subordinates. He was extremely troubled by the seriousness of the situation. In 1837, he tried to personally meet with Shamir, the most difficult to tame Islamic monarch who was the leader of the rebellion. Unfortunately, this meeting never became a reality; when the special envoy sent by the king to contact Shamir about the meeting, the incident changed, and after that Shamir never trusted the Russians, and he was forced to surrender until 22 years later.</p>
<p>For most of this last period, Duke Vorontsov, who had already made a name for himself in the Crimean War, served as the Russian commander-in-chief. After the fruitless campaigns of 1845 to 48, this intelligent and capable general concentrated on internal reforms, in which he was very successful. Until 1856, he and Shamir both took a defensive stance in order to find an opportunity to attack. Vorontsov soon learned the difficulties of mountain warfare and the danger of fighting in a situation that was favorable to the enemy. A vivid description of this situation can be found in the book "The Conquest of the Caucasus" by the Englishman Baddeley. The following is an anecdote from the campaign of 1815:</p>
<p>"At about nine o'clock, the entire army had reached the edge of the forest. Here the commanding officer ordered a few hours' rest so that the soldiers could rest and eat to prepare for the attack. The view to the north was quite attractive to the Russians. Under their feet lay the hostile Chechnya, with undulating mountains stretching for dozens of miles, dotted with dense forests and gloomy valleys.... In the azure distance, a shadow on the horizon was Russia, to which many people took a last look. The route to Dargo stretched over the steep and wooded ridge tops, with no wide open spaces, and some places were only a few feet wide. The entire route formed an extremely long slope, with occasional sudden rises in the road surface. Every four or five hundred yards, the huge tree trunks entwined by the school prevented progress, and countless enemy troops were ambushed in the dense valleys on both sides..."</p>
<p>Duke Vorontsov left the Caucasus before Shamir's final surrender was realized. Since Shamir's surrender, Russia was able to officially establish control from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea. Until this time, both sides had engaged in countless cruel acts, and the sparsely populated villages and mountain farms had also been ravaged, but the basic unity finally replaced the anarchy of ancient traditions, and the Caucasus was able to enjoy a higher and more organized prosperous culture.</p>
<p>It was not until the First Russian Revolution began to shake the entire structure of the Russian Empire that the chaos in the Caucasus revived and the situation became serious. In the events of 1902 to 05, in addition to the traditional animosity of the Caucasians against the Russians, the new movement of the Caucasian people expressing sympathy for the Russian people's resistance to their equally oppressed bureaucratic class and landlord class was beginning to unfold. People with insight among the Russians knew that the Georgian farmers were dissatisfied with sufficient reasons, and the last melancholy report of the Russian Governor-General of the Caucasus, Xu Geof, had thoroughly analyzed this situation.</p>
<p>However, the Russian side never attempted to improve the situation. It is regrettable that the Tsarist government could have skillfully dealt with this situation and adopted a laissez-faire attitude towards Georgia's cultural demands, so that the Christian connection between Georgia and Russia in the past may have been carried forward. On the contrary, the movement to separate from Russia and the Proletarian movement unfolded in parallel, and when the revolution broke out in 1917, Transcaucasia fell into extreme chaos. It was first occupied by the German army, and then by the Allied forces. The purpose of both sides was to prevent the oil wells from falling into the hands of the enemy.</p>
<p>It was not until 1921 that the Red Army, aided by the Bolsheviks' riots in various places, was able to bring Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan under its control, making them a part of the entire Soviet Union. A serious riot broke out in 1924; but since then, the wise policies implemented by the Soviet Union have completely changed the situation. A considerable degree of cultural autonomy, close attention to social reforms, the establishment of state-owned farms, and the opening of new schools, hospitals, and nursing homes have undoubtedly reduced the flames of those who advocate separation from Russia to nothing. In short, today, the people of the Caucasus deeply feel that their relationship with the Russians is on a more equal and more solid foundation than in the past (End)</p>

<p>Lisbon, 13th (Alliance News Agency dispatch) – The Anglo-German battles at the Al Alamein front have been mainly aerial in recent days, hampered by wind and sand since Tuesday, with only artillery fire exchanged. On the previous night, British planes bombed German transport lines as far as Cyprus, attacking Axis transport ships south of the island.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Hai Tong News Agency dispatch) – Military sources here claim that German fighter planes continued to bomb British forces and barracks north of Al Alamein.

<p>Lisbon, 13th (Hai Tong News Agency dispatch) – New York dispatch: According to the American "Newsweek," Britain has made necessary arrangements in Egypt to prevent large quantities of cotton there from falling into Axis hands. This confirms that Britain has decided to adopt a "scorched earth" policy in Egypt. Regarding a plan to destroy the Suez Canal, the "New York Newsletter" commented that Britain has devised a novel method to block navigation of the canal. Since the Suez Canal has no locks, they propose blowing up the sandbanks, causing sand to fall into the river, and sinking several large ships at the same time. This would prevent the Axis powers from using the canal for a time. The newspaper believes this measure is not ideal, and the Axis powers may still be able to quickly restore the canal to operation.</p>

<h3 id="e29">One Lane on Rue Albert Enforces Epidemic Lockdown, Lockdown on Rue Comte Lifted, Over 1800 Cholera Cases in Shanghai <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>According to the English "Shanghai Times," in order to thoroughly eliminate the spread of cholera, the French Concession's health bureau and police force placed an epidemic lockdown on Lane 56 of Rue Albert again on Tuesday, due to four cholera cases occurring in a residence in that lane. This is the second epidemic lockdown implemented by the French authorities this week, the first being implemented five days earlier on a lane on Rue Comte.</p>
<p>Residents of the Lane Strictly Prohibited from Entering and Exiting</p>
<p>It is reported that the lockdown on Rue Comte was lifted yesterday morning. The lockdown on Rue Albert is expected to last for more than three days. After receiving a report of four unconfirmed cholera cases in a house in Lane 569 of Rue Albert, the French Health Department immediately imposed a lockdown on the lane, strictly prohibiting residents from entering and exiting. However, from yesterday onwards, due to residents' requests to go out to work and buy groceries, they were allowed to enter and exit, provided they had vaccination certificates and guarantor residents.</p>
<p>All Houses Are Disinfected</p>
<p>At the same time, all houses in the lane were disinfected, and every resident was vaccinated. It is said that epidemic lockdowns in the International Settlement are not as extensive as those mentioned above. In the French Concession, the discovery of a cholera case immediately attracts the special attention of the health department, and notices are posted on each door to subject it to quarantine and inform it of various epidemic prevention methods. It is also reported that medical students from Aurora University in the French Concession have been invited to join the health department to administer vaccinations. The number of people vaccinated daily is over 30,000. Yesterday, a total of 32,040 people were vaccinated, bringing the total to 1,098,478.</p>
<p>Strict Vaccination Reduces Epidemic Cases</p>
<p>Yesterday, 36,787 people were vaccinated in the International Settlement, so the total number of people vaccinated in the two settlements yesterday was 68,827. The total number in the International Settlement is estimated to be 1,750,000. In the past few days, the discovery of cholera cases has shown a significant decline, decreasing by two to eight cases per day compared to the previous month. As of Tuesday, the total number of cholera cases discovered was 261 in the Chinese area, 358 in the French Concession, and 336 in the International Settlement. The number of deaths was 224 in the Chinese area, 49 in the French Concession, and 65 in the International Settlement.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the "August 13th Shanghai Battle Commemoration Day." The city's police authorities were on high alert beforehand. The border areas of the two settlements first blocked unnecessary roads and dispatched armed detectives to guard important thoroughfares, strictly inspecting pedestrians and vehicles. Starting yesterday morning, the French Concession also dispatched a large number of mobile patrols, placing barbed wire everywhere and dividing them into entrances and exits to inspect vehicles and pedestrians. Even vehicles passing through each road were thoroughly checked. Therefore, the security throughout yesterday was unusually solid.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Times reported that over a hundred British officials arrived in Shanghai last night (the 12th) from North China in order to board the Kamakura Maru, which will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 14th) for repatriation. The local Japanese authorities have drafted various regulations and will issue them to the repatriated nationals today (the 13th). The one hundred and seventy officials from North China and British and Allied nationals having arrived here on Tuesday night, most of the expatriates from other ports who will leave on the Kamakura Maru on Sunday are already in Shanghai. The Kamakura Maru set sail from Yokohama on Monday and berthed in Kobe on Tuesday. After anchoring for a few hours, it sailed directly to Shanghai and will arrive tomorrow to carry the British Consul-General in Shanghai and the staff of the consulate, and personnel from other Allied consulates in Shanghai may also travel on this voyage. However, there are no American or Indian expatriates. A total of 900 British and Allied officials in China will embark on this fourth repatriation voyage to Lourenço Marques, including 70 to 80 officials from North China, 300 officials from Shanghai, and the rest are civilians residing in Shanghai and North China. Dutch nationals (22 or 23), Belgian nationals (28), Polish nationals (31), Norwegian nationals (6), and Greek nationals (2) are also among those being repatriated this time. The English "China Press" reported that the fourth repatriation ship, the Kamakura Maru, will arrive in Shanghai at 5 or 6 a.m. tomorrow (the 14th) and is scheduled to set sail for Lourenço Marques on Sunday.

<p>Since the Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters in Shanghai issued the "Guidelines for Air Defense for Shanghai Citizens" and stated that strong lighting in Shanghai is unfavorable for air defense, Shanghai began implementing lighting control preparations on the 12th. During the lighting control preparation period, all advertising signs, neon lights, and decorative lights in the city were extinguished. All districts in the city implemented the regulations at 7 p.m. on that day, and all neon lights and decorative advertising lights installed by shops on various roads were extinguished in compliance, with satisfactory results. Even the decorative lights in entertainment venues on various bustling roads, which usually shone as brightly as daytime, were also extinguished in a timely manner, no longer like before.</p>

<p>Wang Ziming, the owner of the Xinzhong Pottery Manufacturing Factory at No. 102, Lane 1233, Xiaoshadu Road, purchased borax from Jiang Yichi, a Cantonese person at No. 313, Jiangxi Road, for 40,000 old legal tender in May of this year. At that time, Jiang issued a receipt, instructing Wang to exchange it for a warehouse receipt from a certain bank. However, the warehouse receipt for this batch of goods has not been exchanged to this day, and the market price has been rising steadily to 45,000 new currency. Repeated negotiations to release the goods or return the price have been ineffective. Therefore, Wang was forced to sue Jiang Yichi for fraud to the Central Police Station. The Chinese detective Yan Kang arrested Jiang the day before yesterday, detained him, and waited for the investigation of the case before proceeding.</p>

<p>Shen Quanlin, a local from the rice shop at No. 156 Hanbury Road, Hongkou, rented three rooms on the front floor to He Anlin, a Ningbo native, for a monthly rent of 28 yuan. After the implementation of the new currency, the rent was paid in full, but the rent was not halved, causing mutual friction. The subletter, Shen Quanlin, then asked him to move out, claiming to take it back for his own use. He then refused to stamp the citizen certificate application and did not issue the monthly rice certificate for the rationed grain. He also turned off the electricity and water, using various forms of oppression to force the three tenants and fishmonger He Anlin to submit. The case was reported to the Hongkou Police Station and the Fifth District Office of the Baojia system, causing the police to send detectives to arrest the subletter Shen Quanlin and take him to the police station. Later, a certain gentleman from the Fifth District Office mediated and bailed him out. Shen then filed a lawsuit against He Anlin with the criminal court, stating that the police detectives handcuffed his couple and detained them, etc. The case was heard yesterday morning, and He hired lawyer Wang Peiyuan to file a counterclaim for false accusation, stating the facts of the case. The court ordered each party to submit a guarantee of 2,000 yuan and rescheduled the hearing for further investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e43">New Developments in Evacuation Work, Sending Relief to Impoverished Citizens, Applications Start Today for One Month, Financial Assistance Provided After Investigating and Confirming Poverty <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Pacific War last year, the evacuation of the city's surplus population has long been recognized as a matter of urgency. Later, the Shanghai Municipal Council passed a military resolution to formally establish the Chinese Evacuation Committee, and the evacuation work reached a stage of rapid development.</p>
<p>Significance of Evacuation</p>
<p>Shanghai is an international city and also a commercial and industrial city. Because it is international, it has attracted a large number of refugees from neighboring suburbs. Because it is a commercial and industrial city, it accommodates a large number of workers and merchants. However, the sudden outbreak of the Pacific War cut off the source of raw materials and eliminated all exports of goods. The city's food problem also began to pose a deeper and more serious threat, causing this group of unemployed workers and merchants to return to their hometowns to find new livelihoods, and allowing this group of refugees from the neighboring suburbs who sought refuge in the city to return to their hometowns. For those who return to their hometowns, they can escape the threat of rice and the vortex of high prices. For the city as a whole, it is a necessary measure to maintain the city's security and prosperity.</p>
<p>Several Reforms</p>
<p>At the beginning of its establishment in February of this year, the committee obtained the cooperation of the Central China Railway Company and the East Asia Shipping Co., Ltd., providing all returning Chinese with a 50% discount to enable the evacuation work to achieve a more satisfactory result. By the end of April, the committee had issued half-price return tickets to 50,565 people. Since May 1, due to the excessive losses of the two companies, the evacuation work continued as usual, but the half-price discount was temporarily suspended. However, from May 1 to the end of June, due to the change of the currency system, the rampant speculation, and the soaring prices, it was even more alarming. A total of 18,674 people came to the committee to request return tickets, and the number of people requesting travel expense assistance was even greater. At present, the price surge is difficult to suppress, and the impoverished citizens who cannot afford the high cost of living are everywhere. The return tickets issued by the committee daily exceed thousands of Zhang, and inquiries about preferential measures are constantly coming in. The committee believes that the half-price program has long been suspended. In addition to providing as much convenience as possible to those who request the issuance of return tickets, it is unable to assist those who request assistance or preferential treatment. However, in view of the current hardship of impoverished citizens and the high cost of travel expenses, the number of citizens who want to return to their hometowns but lack travel expenses is indeed very large. Therefore, the committee has consulted with all parties to find a proper solution to help impoverished citizens. Recently, with the cooperation of the Shanghai Branch of the Relief Committee, it was decided to jointly handle relief for impoverished citizens in the city. This is indeed great news for citizens who lack travel expenses and want to return to their hometowns.</p>
<p>Improved Methods</p>
<p>This time’s assistance differs greatly in nature from the half-price preferential treatment previously offered by the committee. The purpose of the previous half-price travel assistance was purely to provide preferential treatment to Shanghai residents returning to their hometowns. Therefore, all citizens residing in Shanghai who genuinely wished to return to their original hometowns without returning to Shanghai could apply to the committee for preferential treatment. However, the purpose of this relief is only to help impoverished citizens who want to leave Shanghai but lack travel expenses. Therefore, the target is only impoverished citizens who genuinely want to return to their hometowns. Due to the different nature of this relief and the previous half-price preferential treatment, the application procedures are also slightly different in order to ensure that genuinely impoverished citizens can benefit universally and that opportunistic citizens cannot use their tricks.</p>
<p>Application Procedures</p>
<p>This time, the committee is jointly conducting relief with the Shanghai Branch of the Relief Committee. The committee is responsible for handling the application investigation and approval matters, and the Relief Committee is responsible for issuing the funds. Impoverished citizens in the city who genuinely wish to return to their original hometowns can go to the committee at No. 277, Fuzhou Road, Shanghai Municipal Council Building, to obtain an application form. After the application form is filled out, it must be guaranteed by the head of the household, the head of the neighborhood, or various charitable organizations that it is indeed impoverished and wants to return to their hometown. Then it must be sent to the committee. After the committee verifies that it is true, it can then go to the committee to obtain a return ticket and a relief ticket. Then, based on the relief ticket, it can go to the Shanghai Branch of the Relief Committee to collect the amount that has been approved by the committee. Although the procedures are slightly cumbersome, they can eliminate fraud.</p>
<p>Financial Assistance</p>
<p>Regarding the amount of relief funds and the number of people who should receive them, according to the principles formulated by the committee and the relief committee, it is to subsidize three-tenths of the total travel expenses. However, if three-tenths of the total travel expenses exceeds 15 yuan, 25 yuan will be subsidized. The travel expenses may be based on train fares or on boat fares, and the amounts vary. In order to make the handling simple and quick, the committee has formulated various standards. Those going to major cities or nearby small cities and towns will be given relief fees according to the standards listed. For those with long distances, 25 yuan will be given uniformly. If there is any false reporting of the destination, once the committee verifies that it is true, in addition to canceling the funds that should be obtained, the guarantor will also be held liable.</p>
<p>Assistance from All Sectors</p>
<p>Since the population of Shanghai has been evacuated, as of now, the committee has issued hometown certificates to approximately 100,000 people. Combining the number of hometown certificates issued by the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, the number can be even more visible. However, due to the excessive population of Shanghai, it still has little impact on the current population of the city. Judging from the rampant cholera in Shanghai and the persistent high prices, the importance of evacuation work is still increasing. The committee's responsibilities lie in doing its best to work for evacuation. We hope that all sectors of the city can deeply understand the evacuation work, benefit both the evacuees themselves and the residents of Shanghai, and give it great cooperation. The committee is still entrusting various native-place associations and national entities to issue return tickets, such as China Travel Service, World Travel Service, Ningbo Native Place Association, and Shaoxing Native Place Association, all of which can issue them on its behalf, and the procedures are extremely simple.</p>
<p>Only Opportunity</p>
<p>This relief will be held from the 13th of this month for one month. We hope that impoverished citizens will not lose such a good opportunity to return to their hometowns. All charitable organizations and major groups are also welcome to send impoverished citizens to the committee for application, but it is necessary to pay close attention to whether they are impoverished and whether they are indeed returning to their hometowns so that genuinely impoverished citizens can have one more opportunity. New wells and existing water wells should be opened and preserved. The above-mentioned natural water conservancy and water wells, if appropriate, may be used to replace items (a) and (d).

<h3 id="e46">A Look at Song and Dance Venues, Then and Now <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>It is said that in Shanghai, for any business, gimmicks are everything. With gimmicks, one need not worry about food and clothing, and can even become famous and wealthy. Gimmicks are related to talent, and those of mediocre talent lack flexible minds, but become very jealous when they see others getting rich. Therefore, every time a gimmick is invented, a large number of people follow suit en masse. On a large scale, there was the previous rush on trust and trading firms; on a small scale, chicken congee and vegetable rice were also once extremely popular. Since the war, there have been two trends that have been particularly strong, almost dizzying. The first was the cotton yarn and silver rush, which rose and fell quickly, followed by the sprouting of insurance stocks and enterprises like bamboo shoots after the rain. Two months ago, someone suddenly chose a corner of the third floor of the New World, opened the Gao Le Song and Dance Venue, and launched a large-scale advertising campaign, touting it as a brand-new style and an ideal paradise. In short, the wording was so effective that it resonated deeply in people's hearts. Not going to visit would be a regret in life. Shanghainese are used to falling for this kind of trick. Sure enough, after the opening, business was booming. In less than a month, the original capital of 100,000 yuan was doubled in profit. As a result, merchants who were holding surplus funds and struggling to find a business to invest in rushed to imitate. Those that have already opened include Gao Le, Jue Lu, Zhang Garden, Heavenly Palace, and Jinmen. The original two Xiao Guang Han venues, fearing being left behind, quickly redecorated. Four others are speeding up preparations and are scheduled to open soon: Da Hua: Tong Yu Chun Restaurant upstairs on Nanjing Road. Da Xin: The original ballroom on the sixth floor of the Da Xin Company on Yu Qiaqing Road. Chang Le: Chang Le Tea House on Si Ma Road. Jin Long Western Restaurant on the third floor is also being converted into a song and dance venue, the name of which has not yet been determined. In addition, it is unknown how many others have sufficient capital but have not yet found a suitable location. Truly, what a grand sight!</p>
<p>Looking back at the history of song and dance venues in Shanghai, it can be said that they have always existed, but they are more prevalent now. I do not know about the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China, but around the tenth year of the Republic of China, Huang Chu Jiu ran the Great World, which was quite ambitious. In addition to incorporating all kinds of northern and southern variety shows, there were also two large venues, which caused quite a stir. One was the Qian Kun Theater, a major Peking opera troupe, and the other was the Gong He Hall, which invited famous courtesans from the northern district. There were many talented people. Roughly speaking, this should be the beginning of song and dance venues in Shanghai. Six or seven years later, after the Qing Lian Ge new building was completed on Si Ma Road, someone took advantage of the evening downtime at the location to open the Xiao Guang Han Song and Dance Venue on the third floor. The layout was roughly the same as the Gong He Hall, but the practice of requesting songs had already begun. The ticket price was 2 jiao per small silver coin, and each song request cost 1 yuan. Memorable performers included Xiang Rong, Wu Cuifen, Jiu Ling, Mei Hua, Xiao Xiao Ling Long, Hong Di, and Cao Huifen, who were known for their beauty or their talent. The lineup could not be considered weak. In addition, the ticket prices were low, so it was not long before a daytime session was added, with even cheaper tickets, only 1 jiao per small silver coin. As mentioned above, Shanghainese like to follow suit en masse. Someone saw that Xiao Guang Han was making a profit and quickly followed suit. Soon, Chang Le opened diagonally opposite Xiao Guang Han, and Shi Dai opened on San Ma Road. Within a hundred steps, three venues stood side by side. Needless to say, competition was fierce. At first, there were only small events such as telephone reservations and perfume handkerchiefs. Then, to gain an advantage, Xiao Guang Han added an extra section after the Qing singing, hiring northerners Ya Yun Ji, Fang Renmi, Wang Mazi, and Zhang Hama to perform comedy. Ya Yun Ji had a signature performance called "Da Bu Gang," which was extremely popular with the audience. The other two venues naturally refused to be outdone and quickly copied the format. After maintaining this for a year or two, Xiao Guang Han came up with another unique idea. At the time, Zhang Henshui's novel "A Tale of Laughter and Tears" was all the rage. Zhang Shichuan and Gu Wuwei fought all the way to the Executive Yuan to win the film production rights. Just as this situation was difficult to resolve and attracting widespread attention, Xiao Guang Han's boss suddenly launched a surprise attack and adapted it into Peking opera, performed by Qing singing girls. Regardless of the performance's success, this gimmick was certainly novel. The venue was packed day and night for a month, and the boss was undoubtedly complacent as the money rolled in.</p>
<p>Only at this point did Shi Dai and Chang Le realize that copying old tricks was not a good strategy and that the key to success was to try something new. So they simply made a fundamental change, hiring a group of female performers to perform Peking opera as the main act, supplemented by Qing singing. Before long, Xiao Guang Han turned around and joined the competition. This was after 1936.</p>
<p>When Xiao Guang Han, Shi Dai, and Chang Le all switched to performing modern-style Peking opera, the competition became even fiercer. Recruiting talent was the top priority, followed by advertising, and no one was willing to be outdone. Xiao Guang Han had mainstays such as Xiao Wang Huchen, Zhou Biyun, Jiang Xiaolou, Su Cuixia, and Liu Qinxin. Shi Dai had mainstays such as Zhang Wenjuan and Jiang Yunxia, and Zhou Meiyan, while Chang Le had mainstays such as Le Di, Qiu Yunyan, and Zhou Meijuan. On the advertising front, they were afraid of being outdone, giving away free tickets and treating people to meals. Some of the female performers, hoping that the audience would praise and support them more, did not hesitate to treat them like fathers. How could they not do their best as adopted daughters? So they sent flower baskets, embroidered curtains, and formed poetry clubs. The scene was no less grand than a group of old and famous scholars wildly supporting the four great Dan actresses.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, good times do not last. Some of the female performers were scouted one by one, and while they were still popular, Zhou Biyun, Qiu Yunyan, and others married and retired. Liu Qinxin, Jiang Yunxia, and others went to other ports to join other troupes. "It is easy to gather a thousand soldiers, but hard to find a general." Once the mainstays were gone, the situation became dismal. Two years ago, Shi Dai was the first to close, followed by Chang Le, which switched to Yue opera. Xiao Guang Han, which had always been known for its gimmicks, was also on its last breath.</p>
<p>Over the past 20 years, song and dance venues have undergone three transformations. The first transformation was from purely Qing singing to allowing guests to request songs. The second transformation was from allowing guests to request songs to incorporating performances. It is unknown whether the newly emerging song and dance venues will increase the number of performances in the future. Currently, they are all mainly based on requesting songs. The difference from the past is that after being requested to sing, the female performer has the obligation to sit with the guest. This is the third transformation.</p>
<p>For female performers, being requested to sing at a song and dance venue is seen as an opportunity to show off. For those requesting songs, it is either to show support or for other purposes. At Xiao Guang Han and Sheng Shi Dai, requesting a song cost 1 yuan, the same price as now. However, most patrons would only request one song. In recent times, the trend has gradually become extremely extravagant, with some requesting as many as half a dozen or a dozen. In 1935, a certain general, appearing in Shanghai in a grand style, occasionally visited Xiao Guang Han. After being encouraged by friends, he requested 10 dozens for Xiao Xiao Ling Long. At the time, this was seen as an unprecedentedly extravagant act. Today, it is considered the bare minimum. On the third day of Gao Le's opening, the reporter and a friend went along. Halfway up the stairs, they encountered a female performer, Miss XX, who was known for her straightforwardness and immediately said, "Hey! Xiao Pan, the yellow-headed [foreigner] isn't giving me any money. Help me out!" Because they were old acquaintances, it was natural to be obligated. Okay, how about five dozens? He figured that five dozens would be 60 yuan, which the reporter already considered quite luxurious. Who knew that after entering the venue, he kept hearing the staff reporting that Mr. So-and-so requested 100 dozens for Miss So-and-so, or 200 dozens for someone else, and that 50 dozens and 30 dozens were no longer eye-catching. The reporter was ashamed and embarrassed by his poverty. What a difference a year makes! Who knew things would get so much worse!</p>
<p>According to those familiar with the business: song and dance venues at this time are indeed quite profitable. The average capital invested is around 100,000 to 250,000 yuan. The tea charge of 3 yuan is enough to cover most of the expenses. The revenue from song requests is pure profit. They distribute it as follows: 12 yuan per dozen song requests, 6 yuan goes to the female performer, 3 yuan to the owner, 2 yuan to the band, and 1 yuan to the tea servers and miscellaneous workers. Taking a total of 2,000 dozens of song requests per day and night sessions as the standard, the owner can earn 6,000 yuan per day, or 180,000 yuan per month. Even if you take a 50% cut, you can still recover the capital in two to three months.</p>
<p>Some people doubt whether this prosperity can last. On this point, the reporter has the following observations: the income from song requests cannot be relied upon too much. Shanghainese are very astute when it comes to spending money. Those who desperately request songs for a while are likely to have ulterior motives. After a certain amount of time, they will definitely realize that this kind of repayment method is too uneconomical (the patron pays 1 yuan, but the female performer only gets 5 jiao). This is the same principle as buying tickets and sitting in a dance hall. The decline of dance halls from their peak can serve as a warning to song and dance venues. Therefore, song and dance venues that do not want to establish an unbeatable foundation should do so. If they want to establish an unbeatable foundation, they should still rely on Qing singing and equipment to attract customers. Frankly speaking, although the new song and dance venues have no shortage of outstanding women, the general lineup is still weak. Therefore, in the reporter's opinion, the most urgent task for song and dance venue authorities in the future is to find or train female performers. As for equipment and hospitality, they are obviously far superior to the past, which is a kind of progress that cannot be denied. (Qin Meng)</p>

Students can choose according to their own goals and needs. The third entrance examination of the school is scheduled for the 20th of this month. Enrollment is very enthusiastic.</p>
<h3 id="e48">University Group and Free Quotas: Continued Application Processing, But University Students Must Have a Letter of Recommendation from the School <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The third round of the Shen Bao Reader Scholarship Fund is about to be completed. The approved list for the primary school group was published for three days on the 11th, 12th, and 13th. Today, the publication of the approved list for the middle school group begins. Whether or not they receive assistance, no separate notifications will be given. The list published in the newspaper will serve as the basis. Please pay close attention to it and to all the procedures in the "Instructions for Receiving Funds." Applications for special applications for the university group and free quotas from various schools will continue to be processed from today.</p>
<p>Special Extension of Application for University Group</p>
<p>The number of applicants for this year's university group has already exceeded more than double the previous two times. After the application deadline, many impoverished university students still sent letters requesting leniency in applying for the scholarship. After careful consideration by the Scholarship Committee members Shen Silang, Chen Xuan Shan, Lu Gaoyi, and Zhao Zongyu on the 12th, it was believed that rescuing impoverished university students was even more urgent than helping middle and primary school students. It was decided to grant a special extension of the application deadline, from today until the 20th of this month. Applicants can continue to obtain application forms from the newspaper and fill them out according to the procedures. However, it should be especially noted that this application must be accompanied by a written certificate from the university authorities, confirming that the applicant is of excellent character and academic standing, and comes from an impoverished family to qualify.</p>
<p>Continued Application for Free Academic Quotas</p>
<p>The Shen Bao Reader Scholarship Movement has received enthusiastic support from various middle and primary schools, tutoring schools, etc., with many donating free academic quotas. This spirit is truly admirable. In addition to the Mingxin Accounting Tutoring School and the Jinxiu Extra-Curricular Tutoring School, which have already been fully subscribed, the following schools still have vacancies. From today until the 20th of this month, application forms can be obtained from the newspaper and filled out for registration. Once the application is approved, they will be sent for free (tuition) admission. These include: Chengyi Middle School, No. 294 Xiafei Road; Cambridge English College, Cishu Building, No. 520 Nanjing Road (5 places each for ordinary high school and junior high school); and Yueqie Middle School, Meilan Middle School, Qiazhong Girls' School, Daguang Middle School, Zhongguang Middle School, Pudong Junyi Middle and Primary School, China Textile Industry Tutoring School, Dalu Middle and Primary School, Qilu Night School, Huahua Middle and Primary School, China School for the Deaf, Newspaper Workers' Children's School, etc.</p>

<p>(II) Middle School Group</p>
<p>Instructions for Receiving Funds: Scholarship checks will be issued starting on the 17th of this month. All approved applicants must come to the newspaper as soon as possible within one week from the 17th, accompanied by themselves or their parents, bringing their personal seal (the original seal affixed to the application form) to receive the check. Failure to do so within the deadline will result in forfeiture. All students whose names have been published, if they need to change schools, please immediately send a letter to the newspaper stating the reasons for changing schools and requesting a change. Otherwise, once the check has been signed, no changes can be made. After receiving the check, the school must be responsible for collecting the money from the bank within two weeks. Failure to do so will result in cancellation. If there are special reasons for the need to reissue the check, and the newspaper agrees, the original check should be returned before it can be reissued. If an applicant is unable to enroll due to other reasons, the check that has been received should be returned as soon as possible. The original documents can be redeemed with the registration certificate.</p>

The production of the factory has also increased considerably, so the supply should not be a problem. The recent reduction in retail volume is purely due to delays in the moving permit.</p>

<p>According to the express news from Xuzhou, Guzhen and other places yesterday, new watermelon seeds have already been launched on the market, but the output is not strong, and the initial weather was too dry, followed by heavy rain, so the harvest will be reduced. Therefore, the production price is still high. Large watermelon seeds are priced at over 500 yuan, and small seeds also require a strong 400 yuan, so the various firms here have no intention of purchasing. Those who have made slight purchases are also just testing the new product.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Autumn <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— Si Nai</p>
<p>Since the beginning of autumn, the weather has gradually turned cooler, and everyone seems to be taking a breath, but we cannot ignore the "autumn tiger."</p>
<p>The autumn tiger may be even more fierce than summer. The daytime is hot, and the night is cool, with uneven temperature changes, making it easy to get sick.</p>
<p>Sometimes there is another gust of autumn wind and rain, and everyone suffers. Everyone is worried that a severe drought will occur, and once the crops are not harvested, even worse things will befall us. We cannot be afraid!</p>
<p>Some people still think it's the same as summer, muddling along, unwilling to do things, euphemistically saying that the weather is still hot, eating and drinking cold things in large quantities, and want to comfortably enjoy happiness, but they do not know that if they do not work hard in autumn, there will be no stored grain in winter. All kinds of cholera and epidemics are even more rampant in autumn. Continuing to be confused like this, they will definitely regret it later.</p>
<p>Autumn is bleak, take care of yourself!</p>
<h3 id="e61">In the Midst of the Plague <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Ma Niu</p>
<p>"Oh! The assistant at the steamed bun shop next door was lively and energetic just a few hours ago, and now he's gone. A sudden stomach ache, and he's dead. I wonder what bad thing he ate again?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, you really have to be careful what you eat these days. A friend's relative had a bowl of zha jiang noodles at a snack shop, and immediately died after returning home!"</p>
<p>"Even banquets are hard to enjoy. Who knows how long that meat and shrimp have been soaking in the refrigerator?"</p>
<p>In this narrow, crowded alley, it suddenly becomes lively in the evening. Although there isn't a cool breeze to be felt, it is still much more spacious than the lofts and kitchen sheds where we live. And people have a habit of seeking out crowds and busyness. Who wouldn't be happy to chat aimlessly with neighbors about anything and everything? So the alley is quite packed. These days, perhaps because of the city-wide epidemic, everyone's conversations inevitably turn to this issue.</p>
<p>Mrs. Qiao is also one of the participants in the conversation, but unlike others who treat the conversation as a passing breeze, she still has a heavy stone weighing on her heart. This stone is the tiger-like plague, and it seems to be pressing down on her three children, and her thin Mr. Qiao.</p>
<p>"If we catch the disease, it'll be terrible!" Mrs. Qiao worries. She says to herself, "Starting tomorrow, I have to thoroughly clean up everything, especially the food."</p>
<p>The next day, Mrs. Qiao's second child is already clamoring for his mother to buy him breakfast. But today, Mrs. Qiao puts on a stern face and says, "The fried dough sticks and sesame cakes at the street entrance are not clean. Starting today, you are not allowed to eat them anymore..." As usual, Mrs. Qiao's family doesn't light the stove in the morning to save coal briquettes, so they buy snacks to eat. And the snacks are usually sesame cakes and steamed buns. Now that the "order" forbids them to eat these, it's not just the children crying and fussing; even Mr. Qiao, who's in a hurry to get to the "office," wrinkles his brow: "What are we going to eat then? Cook porridge? Rice isn't cheap, and we still need side dishes. Eating at the tea house, two barbecued pork buns cost more than a dollar, and it's not enough to fill me up!" In the end, after much arguing, Mrs. Qiao finds it difficult to please everyone. Originally, if they don't eat sesame cakes, what else can they eat? She buys them first and then thinks of a solution. Mr. Qiao always walks to the "office" to save money, and he eats his meals at the office. This makes Mrs. Qiao worry again. First, walking in the hot sun is too much for her thin Mr. Qiao. Second, the boxed lunches that the employees eat are mostly unhygienic and lack nutrition. So she kindly advises Mr. Qiao, but Mr. Qiao tilts his back, which has been bent by life's hardships, and scorns his wife's "woman's opinions": "First of all, the prices for taking the tram or rickshaw are outrageous, ranging from half a dollar to three dollars. As for boxed lunches, if I don't eat them, what else am I going to eat? I need to fill my stomach now, so who cares about hygiene!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Qiao is splashed with cold water. Thinking that her husband won't listen to her advice, she decides to think of a solution for the children. So she says to Mr. Qiao, "Go to the main street and buy a pound of biscuits, so the children don't eat unclean snacks. And Mao Mao is really too thin, don't forget to bring him some cod liver oil pills."</p>
<p>Mr. Qiao doesn't answer, puts on his straw hat, and leaves.</p>
<p>The children are restless and complain about the heat, running around outside early in the morning. The alley is also very smelly, but the children prefer to play hide-and-seek on the garbage heap. This makes Mrs. Qiao shout at the top of her lungs: "Come inside, come inside! The alley is not clean!" But the two children outside don't come in, and Mao Mao, who is sleeping inside, suddenly starts crying loudly. Mrs. Qiao walks into the room with the "hot water heater," and Mao Mao points to his leg and cries, "Bug! Bug!" It turns out that Mao Mao's calf has been bitten by bedbugs, leaving a large red mark. The alley is noisy like a blacksmith's shop, and Mao Mao is like a hot iron, covered with heat rash, sores, and mosquito bites.</p>
<p>After settling Mao Mao, Mrs. Qiao goes to the market to buy groceries, and then busies herself with cutting, washing, and cooking. The kitchen is even hotter, and Mrs. Qiao feels dizzy and nauseous. She quickly drinks two bottles of "sha" medicine water.</p>
<p>At dusk, Mr. Qiao returns home. Mrs. Qiao stares at him and asks, "Where are the biscuits?" Mr. Qiao spreads his hands: "They're gone. They cost more than ten dollars a pound. I haven't received this month's salary yet, and I haven't even bought flour for this week!"</p>
<p>At this moment, the two older children are holding red, frozen cakes of some kind. Mrs. Qiao doesn't say anything. She thinks, "What hygiene and nutrition are we talking about for people like us!" The plague is like a large stone, but Mrs. Qiao feels that all she can do is "leave it to fate" if it falls!</p>
<h3 id="e62">Self-Portrait <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Kui</p>
<p>Within the "Greater Self" exists an insignificant seventeen-year-old "Lesser Self." He hails from Baoshan County, Jiangsu Province, born into a poor family, and possesses an inherent disdain for others due to his impoverished background. The name "Wen Kui" is utterly unsuitable for him, but to facilitate recognition and distinction, Mr. Wu bestowed it upon him during his elementary school days, and he readily adopted it as his own. Had no one named him, any numerical designation would have sufficed. He is innately fond of nonchalance and embodies a quintessential sanguine temperament. He would rather be beaten than scolded, refusing to yield under any circumstances, yet he himself delights in berating others. Exploiting minor advantages is his forte, evident in all his actions: he freely borrows from others without returning, while jealously guards his own possessions, offering flimsy excuses to avoid lending. However, when expounding upon his philosophy of life, he articulates the profound notion of "you can't bring it with you when you're born, and you can't take it with you when you die," conveniently adding that "what's yours is mine, but what's mine is mine, and you can't have it." He frequently denounces the snobbery of the wealthy, citing numerous relatives who once were poor but now are rich. Any assistance provided to the impoverished evokes his vehement condemnation: "These ungrateful wretches, whom I once elevated, now act as if they are superior, turning their backs on their benefactors. Their comeuppance will arrive one day, and then I shall have my revenge." Such Schadenfreude is a recurrent theme in his pronouncements. At times, he proclaims, "If I were rich, I would do this and that..." In reality, even if he possessed the entire world, he would likely become the epitome of snobbery. When a friend achieves success, whether through diligence or luck, his admiration morphs into envy, even contemplating malicious schemes to undermine them. As for himself, he fantasizes about success, believing it to be ordained by fate. Success, he believes, is inevitable with good fortune, so he sits at home all day, awaiting the arrival of his lucky break, doing nothing but eating three meals a day. The downfall of a friend elicits his great joy. On the surface, he advises them on how to improve, but in his heart, he wonders why they don't become beggars. He is aware of his numerous shortcomings, and devises various plans for improvement, yet never puts them into practice. Even when he does attempt change, he unwittingly relapses into his old habits, all the while presenting himself as a remarkable individual to others.</p>
<p>In every corner of the world, especially in urban areas, there are many like him. But is he inherently this way? No, absolutely not! He has been molded. When there are no such individuals as him in the world, that will be a time of universal peace.</p>
<h3 id="e63">To Fellow Students Receiving Aid <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>University, junior high school, primary school, vocational, and supplementary school students who applied for financial aid have undergone screening examinations, interviews, and other review procedures. Approvals have now been granted and are being announced sequentially. Those students receiving financial aid are able to continue their studies thanks to donations from various sectors, thus providing a temporary respite from economic hardship. However, we believe that in addition to the economic assistance urgently needed by students, spiritual cultivation and academic exchange are also fundamental issues for their education. Resolving the difficulties of enrollment provides an opportunity for education. Achieving academic success is of course the students' own responsibility, and also the expectation of the donors.</p>
<p>Here, based on a spirit of earnestness, we would like to discuss a few points regarding the attitude toward learning with the students receiving aid.</p>
<p>Zuo Zongtang said, "One only has a few years to truly focus on studying. Before sixteen, knowledge has not yet dawned; after twenty-five or twenty-six, worldly affairs become increasingly complex. If these few years are wasted, then nothing will be accomplished." These are a few words that are quite worthy of our attention. We must cherish time and concentrate our minds. How can we relax even the slightest bit the opportunity to study that we have obtained with such difficulty? Even if we have the means to study in the future, we will never again have the opportunity to study hard at the appropriate age. This is the first point.</p>
<p>Zeng Guofan said, "Diligence in study is like digging a well. Rather than digging many wells and never reaching the spring, why not focus on one well, striving to reach the spring, and then using it inexhaustibly? In terms of the ordinary subjects at school, these are common knowledge that everyone should have. Of course, we are not hoping that students will specialize in only one subject. However, considering the industry and commerce employees, there are many students who request to study several subjects. Their courage to learn is commendable, but in order to be practical and to achieve learning outcomes, we feel that it is easier to obtain results by specializing in one subject in stages. This is the second point.</p>
<p>Zhu Xi said, "Studying is like cooking meat; you must first cook with a strong fire, and then simmer with a slow fire." This is the experience of one's own rigorous management. The Family Instructions of Liu Bin also state, "Self-cultivation must be earnest, and learning must be firm." Since ancient times, those who have achieved academic success have all come from hard work and diligent study. This is the third point.</p>
<p>Of course, the sages of the past have left many good words regarding the way of learning, which can serve as models for the students. Today, we only present a few fragments, or things that students may have heard before. We hope that students will deeply inscribe the words "today's scholars are for others," cultivate themselves quietly in this learning process, and abandon bad habits. Learning is for seeking knowledge, and seeking knowledge is for application. The students receiving aid today will surely be the capable materials of society in the future. This is our wish.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Sharing a Boat in the Storm <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(8) What to Do</p>
<p>This was truly astonishing. Mrs. Ye Er, fearing her hearing wasn't sharp enough, opened her mouth and asked, "What did you say?" Even after asking, she kept her mouth open, waiting for He Zixing's reply. He Zixing said, "Neither the young master nor A Xing are at the Chen's house." He Zixing had already repeated himself to make it clear that what he told Mrs. Ye Er the first time was no different from the second time. Cui Zhen also became anxious and said, "He Zixing, you must have gone to the wrong house. Maybe there are many families named Chen in Shuangqiao Town. The one you asked about isn't the one the young master went to. This Chen family has a large elm tree in front of their door; not far from the Chen family is a house with black walls; their house is old-fashioned and not very tall; their grandmother likes to chant scriptures and is very old. Is this the family you asked about?" He Zixing said, "How could it not be? Yes, I may not be able to read, but I know these things. Second Madam, it's cold outside, let's talk inside."</p>
<p>Mrs. Ye Er moved inside. In the dim twilight, He Zixing took off his straw sandals in the courtyard, walked barefoot into the wing room, and said, "The Chen family is in Shuangqiao Town, with a big tree in front of the door. I didn't notice if it was an elm tree, but I didn't make any mistake. The old lady of the Chen family said to me, 'Our young master left our house yesterday after eating, and A Xing also ate at our house.'" Mrs. Ye Er and Cui Zhen said in unison, "He Zixing, why are you talking like this? One moment you say the young master isn't at the Chen's house, and the next moment you say the young master ate at the Chen's house?" He Zixing said, "I didn't say anything wrong. The young master and A Xing ate at the Chen's house yesterday; today when I went to the Chen's house, neither the young master nor A Xing were there." Mrs. Ye Er and Cui Zhen both patted their chests to calm their nerves, and also felt somewhat relieved. They understood after hearing He Zixing continue: Wei Cheng and his servant had braved the thunder to go to the Chen family yesterday morning. Chen Guoqi wasn't even home, so Wei Cheng waited, then went directly to Shanghai from Shuangqiao, most likely to visit Chen Guoqi's siblings. (154)</p>
<h3 id="e65">Busyness and Leisure <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— Grape</p>
<p>In the previous issue of this journal, I read an article entitled "How to Utilize Free Time." It was a record of a lecture that encouraged young students to make good use of their free time during the summer vacation to "accumulate" knowledge in the areas of morality, intellect, physique, and aesthetics. The intention was excellent.</p>
<p>However, there are also things worth discussing, namely, the division of humanity into two types: busy people and idle people. The former includes teachers, students, company employees...; the latter includes vagrants and beggars, and the speaker hoped that the audience and readers would learn to be busy people.</p>
<p>I believe that what needs to be noted is that busy people are not necessarily "good people" or "builders of society." Although they bustle about all day long, most of them are still motivated by selfishness and self-interest; even if they occasionally achieve something and earn various respectable titles, what do they contribute to society?</p>
<p>As for vagrants and beggars, although they are disdained by the public, they are also an inevitable product of an unhealthy society. Calling them "idle people" seems inappropriate; "those who have money have leisure" is a very simple truth. Leaving aside the leisured class who indulge in extravagant pleasures, it is unfair to blame the beggars who are ostracized from the professional circles and struggle to survive.</p>
<p>Since the meaning of "busyness" and "leisure" has not been affirmed, the yardstick used to divide humanity is also unreliable.</p>
<p>However, "time is money," and it is the responsibility of every progressive person to make good use of every moment to contribute to the welfare of human society.</p>
<p>"Busyness" should mean working intensely.</p>
<p>And "leisure" should not be synonymous with passively waiting for death!</p>
<h3 id="e66">The Philosophy of Wearing Old Clothes <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— Ge Liang</p>
<p>Is there a philosophy to wearing old clothes? Yes! Of course there is!</p>
<p>If you wear an old gown and broken leather shoes and walk down the street, and you immediately feel shy, ashamed, or even blush when others look at your gown or shoes, then you lack the "philosophy of old clothes."</p>
<p>However, if you want to buy a new outfit, that's not bad either. But when you step into a cloth shop, you can't help but stick out your tongue at the prices, and you can't help but frown at the materials. Taking a step back, if you don't go to a tailor, then go ask your mother for a thread for the clothes on your wanderer body, but just the money for buying a needle and thread is enough for a new cloth jacket before.</p>
<p>The philosophy of wearing old clothes is this: if someone notices your broken leather shoes, that doesn't matter, you don't have to be embarrassed. If you wear the most fashionable, most beautiful, newest, most modern, most attractive new leather shoes on the street, you will of course attract the attention of others. What do you feel at that time? Probably nothing more than pleasant! Since this is the case, why should you be uneasy in the former case and high-spirited in the latter case, even though you are both being noticed by others! So you might as well raise your feet higher and show off your broken leather shoes, and let others appreciate them.</p>
<p>A true friend values knowing your heart, but if a friend only knows your clothes, and doesn't greet you because he sees your outfit isn't "valuable," that's fine, let him go. The passive way to deal with this is to be indifferent. Not talking to me saves me from reciting thirty-six famous polite greetings. The active way to deal with this is, he despises my clothes, I despise his snobbery. Humph, it is impolite not to reciprocate!</p>
<p>In this day and age, you don't need to envy or be jealous of others' new clothes, and you also don't need to be ashamed of your own worn clothes. As for feeling ashamed, you simply shouldn't. Because no matter if it's a dog or a cat, a pushcart driver or a rickshaw puller, once they get rich, they dress up so elegantly that poets and writers can't reach them, and scholars and literati retreat three houses, then, on the other hand, in this chaotic world, shouldn't we wear old gowns and broken leather shoes? Wouldn't that be too...too something, right?</p>
