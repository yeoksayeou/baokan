<h3 id="c21">印度半島廵禮記（二） <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>在帕帖拉躭擱了數天，我們才第一次攝了一張判査布農民生活的影片。在印度北部平原上農民唯一的工作就是灌溉田畝。英人雖在此處開盤不少運河，但乾涸的隴畝所賴的水源全靠一頭老牛，遮蔽了眼睛在村中的井邊車水。</p>
<p>德里一瞥</p>
<p>在一個燦爛冬天的下午，我們抵達首都德里，在此停車止宿。二千年來，這些已受兵燹的城墻看見不少朝代的更迭。德里有舊王宮的遺跡，的確是古印度時代所留存的偉大工程。德里大部份的建築物據說都在莫臥兒征服印度後四百年所建。可是新德里城和舊城一同並存。本來是一片陽光照耀的平原，英人把這地方開闢爲一繁榮的城市，市內全是林蔭大道。由全印戰爭紀念門望出去，可以見到英皇喬治五世銅像，以至有二英哩外面的總督府，兩側官舍林立，景色雄偉，和歐洲諸大城市相較，不相上下。</p>
<p>我們想由德里出發，向西南方面橫越印度，沿喇其普他拿省邊境以達巴羅達，再由此北入印度沙澳，然後取道亞格刺由德加公路赴加爾各答。因此我們去訪國內部各要員，承他們竭力幫助，我們就取道赴齋浦耳離德里約有二百哩路遠</p>
<p>一路濃蔭夾道，永使我們感到神奇。百呎高的樹，幹大十圍，樹葉繁密，拱立在路側有二三排之多。長尾巴的灰色猴子在樹頂上盪來盪去，對路過的汽車裝鬼臉。</p>
<p>路上到處可以遇到妨害汽車的禍物，一長列牛車。無論車輛是黃牛拖的，或是水牛拖的，有一件事情總是一律—趕牛人總是夢入黑甜，使我們常要疑心睡神有無把此人窒息至死。喇叭聲非要特別延長，才可有效，（我們後來把別克脾汽車上的喇叭都撳壞了）於是把一長列蹣跚行走的姓口一隻一隻的拖到路旁邊。</p>
<p>當心撞牛</p>
<p>如其撞倒了一匹印度的聖牛，那是汽車駕駛者的不幸，他的禍患可就不小！撞倒一個人怕還沒有這樣大的罪名。還有，喇其普他拿多孔雀。在有的省份中，殺死一隻長尾巴的孔雀，就要處以七年的徙刑，可是這種鳥類常在汽車前面成羣跑過。</p>
<p>灰砂和印度公共汽車是另外兩樣討厭的東西。灰砂旣濃重，又是窒息得很，而且到處皆是。它會鑽進緊閉在車廂中的一本電影雜誌中間。公共汽車是美國廠家製造，載重一噸半，可是難得載乘搭客及共行李在三噸之下的。</p>
<p>我們離德里後休息下來的第一站是亞爾娃，英僑紛紛在會客廳中招待我們，王公亦來賜見。我們在這裏見到的山崗很低，自離了開伯爾山道以來一千哩內，從未見過這樣低的山勢。我們現已走到一條分界錢上，印度的北部是回敎，約有回敎徒一萬萬人，廣大的南方，則是三萬萬印度敎徒。北方就是判査布，西南是喇其普他拿。</p>
<p>離亞爾娃八十一哩，我們即到喇共普省中四名城之一，齋浦耳城。年輕的王公很熱烈地招待我們，有一很威嚴的隨從衛護了我們進宮。王公數月前因飛機失事兩腿折斷，新近不需手杖可以行走。他原是著名國際的馬球選手，現在被迫不能活動，甚爲懊喪，因此也無從倍伴我們到他國境四周去游歷。</p>
<p>我們在齋浦耳市街上巡游了一周。一天，我們在大街上見到一次婚禮的行列。第一是一匹沒有人騎的馬鞍齊備的馬，接着是一頂空轎子（這兩樣東西顯然要把行列拖長的緣故）；次爲一隊樂隊，吹奏十五年前的美國樂調，後面是新郎與儐相坐在一頭象身上，象牙華麗又堅靱，突出在二腿之前；接着是新娘，坐在遮掩的轎子中，最後是新郎新娘睡的床褥。</p>

<p>三月二十一日，上海法國僑民舉行了一次盛大的集會。這一天，差不我所有留居在上海的法國人，不分男女老少，官紳仕商，大家都很有秩序地參加「法國在華軍人會」所發起的常年大會。地點在邁爾西愛路法國網球總會，在尙未到　開會時問以前，會塲中已無隙地，原有的座位都被佔滿，遲到者只好在甬道中臨時添設椅凳，以便聆聽會長普來西氏Plessis的演講。</p>
<p>會塲中懸有藍白紅的三色旗，在華軍人會會徽，和貝當上將的肖像。在貴賓席中，有法總領事馬傑禮夫婦，法國駐華防守總司令愛沙蒂埃夫婦等。此外，還有幾百個歐戰退伍軍人，國民革命志願軍人，男女法僑，個個充滿着亢奮的情緒，傾聽着會長報吿會務。</p>
<p>普來西氏先分析上海法僑處境的困難，次闡明精神團結及服從元首的必要，並檢討過去一年中法國在華軍人會所舉辦的種種事業，和今後應加改進的各項工作。未宣布該會對於法國應有的貢獻及任務，希望全滬的男女法僑，都能踴躍參加該會新近組織的國民革命志願隊，以便積極推行復興新法蘭西的工作。演　歷一小時餘，到會聽衆，莫不爲之動容，在全塲熱烈鼓掌聲中，即宣吿散會。</p>
<p>按「法國在華軍人會」，原名Ｌa　Legion　Framais　e　des　Combattants　de　Chine，成立於一九四一年三月二十二日，距今恰屆一週年。該會前身爲一歐戰退伍戰友會」，自去年起，由貝當上將任命普來西氏爲法國在華軍人會會長，即吸收戰友會會員一百十五人加入軍人會，於去年五月十日舉行第一次常年大會，共有會員一百四十人，目下在上海冇會員一百八十人；在天津該會華北支部，現有會員三十餘人，津扈二地，共計二百餘人。</p>
<p>該會去年曾發起慰勞俘虜運動，依當初的計劃，原擬經常郵寄慰勞品，分發給被禁在集中營的法國俘虜，後以航運斷絕未能實行。但該會凡遇發起各種善舉募捐運動，從不後人，統計該會經募款項，爲數頗巨，約共達二十四萬餘元。</p>
<p>法國在華軍人會會長普來西氏，在大會中曾大聲疾呼，勸吿上海男女法僑共同報名參加該會，響應貝當所號召的「國民革命志願隊」Volontaires　de　la　RevolutionNationale。在演詞中，他闡述貝當上將對於全世界法國人民的期望，並稱頌他的敬勞勳功。「我們應該運循這一位兩次拯救法國於危難中的偉人的指示。在統一表記之下，盡捐過去的成見，大家都投奔到他的懷抱中。在法國僅有的唯一力量，便是由貝當上將所領導的恢復祖國的道德運動。本會籲一切的法國人來共同合作參加這一種艱苦的愛國工作。我們要擁護唯一的最高領袖，在唯一的國旗之下，抱着唯一個共同的希望，我們的責任便是復興祖國於危難之際。國民革命不做別的事，只要淬　民氣，規勉大衆埋頭苦幹。你們每日每時當滲透以這種觀念，否則你枉費氣力，不能重見你的祖國復興。在你生活上，每一個行動都要牢記着祖國是在苦難中，從今開始，你要肩負起雙重困苦的工作。你們的唯一命令，便是「服務」，只有在犧牲中，可以獲得你們所期望的一切。」（寄客）</p>

<p>— 敏</p>
<p>法侖斯夜總會改行</p>
<p>彷彿還是隔昨的事，上海的夜生活正在全盛時代，紙迷金醉，城開不夜，儘多那批痴男怨女，晨昏顚倒，爲歡作樂，娛樂塲所，那一家不是顧客盈門，尤其是滿充着神秘色彩的西區夜總會，如伊文泰，法侖斯和阿眞廷那等，處處爲顧客盡歡着想，於是醇酒美人之外，更備各式各樣的賭博，引誘顧客，好在不愁沒有千金一擲的寄生蟲，於是夜總會老闆面團團作富家翁，自在意中。</p>
<p>然而上海租界，究非世外桃源，隨着世界大戰的更趨緊張，而受影響漸劇，終於嚴行節省電力，限制汽油，提早娛樂塲所收業時間，减少公共車輛，那些夜總會接二連三的遭受重大打擊，已深感營業爲難，迨至最近，更覺無法維持，曾幾何時，上海的娛樂事業已呈崩潰之勢，往日燈燭輝煌的西區夜總會，也變得冷冷淸淸人跡罕見了！</p>
<p>提起大西路上的法侖斯夜總會，滬人非但耳熱能詳，且曾在那裏通宵盡歡的，也不在少。老　喬易·法侖斯，中年禿頂，三分像美國的喜劇電影明星羅蘭揚，往日遊客常見他穿着小禮服，周旋招待。法侖斯爲人精幹，鑒於夜總會的末日已至，毅然改行，將法侖斯夜總會的後園闢爲農塲，脫去禮服，換上短衣，親自督察中西員工多人，先從養豬和雞着手。法侖斯夜總會褐色房屋的外表，雖和以前一樣，進門一望，却已面目全非，酒香粉膩的歡樂塲，竟一變而爲禽畜羣處的飼養地，叫人不禁興滄海桑田之感。</p>
<p>法侖斯農塲現劃分兩部，豬雞各半，雞約三百頭，以羽色區別，各有鉛絲網隔開，不許混雜。說來也很有趣，架設赤色雞棚所用的木村，便是造總會的賭台，無論台面，台脚，橫木，全都拆下，蓋成雞棚，足見法侖斯的經營農塲，確是下了決心的。</p>
<p>農塲的那面是一排豬圈，長二十五碼，關五碼，滿地泥漿，大小肥豬本有四十頭，近又增加十二頭，不久更將續增。此外，並將添養馬三匹和共他禽畜。法侖斯對於雞和豬的飼料，非常重視，因爲這是有關農塲成績的，豬的飼料，以胡蘿蔔爲主，飼雞的榖類，也經挑選，按時飼給。據說法侖期非待禽畜飽食，而認爲滿意，自己不願進膳，其經營農塲的專心從事，可見一斑。</p>
<p>法侖斯非但督察餵飼工作，且親自收蛋放人孵卵器，校騐溫度，暇時便計劃怎樣改進擴充，終日不息。據法侖斯說，他覺得辦農塲比夜總會有　味得多，工作至今，所獲成績已很可滿意。他的農塲所產雞卵，平均較市上的爲大，且嘗過的人都讚它的滋味鮮美。塲中現有雞約三百只，逐漸孵化，不久便可增至一千只。</p>
<p>在這個年頭，經營農場，確是穩妥的事業，法侖斯從消耗塲所的老闆，一變而爲生產者，其精神倒也値得佩服。</p>

<p>— 蘇少卿</p>
<p>程派靑衣章遏雲之北遊京津，係欲携其妹逸雲同去，爲欲使其妹親覧京派戲劇，得以觀摩而冀深迭也。去後至今將有一載，有二消息，一幸一不幸，不幸者爲其琴師穆鐵芬得中風病暴亡。幸者遏雲受黃金之聘，即將南來接麒鱗童之後也。所帶配角，爲老生紀玉良，小生葉盛蘭等，盛蘭常與遏雲配小生，有駕輕就熟之妙。紀玉良去歲在黃金連陞三級，驟掛頭牌，運氣之佳，晋級之速，伶界少有。今肯降階爲副車，極似楊寳森之屈就程硯秋，皆是識時務之俊傑也。或謂：前年遏雲之搭黃金，本是楊寳森之二牌，今何以不用寳森，而約新進之紀玉良耶？吾曰：是有緣故，昔唐之李績，宋之岳飛，每臨大陣，必親自爲士卒相面，選其面有光彩，吉星旺相者，且曰：「打仗何等重大，生死榮辱，繫於一時，若非鴻運當頭，豈有必勝之理？」今遏雲之選玉良，黃金之加聘，皆得古名將臨陣之意。夫唱戲正如用兵，此次必獲全勝，不卜可知也。惟鐵芬旣死，誰爲之操琴，却是一謎，鐵芬之隨遏雲奏琴，有十年之久，琴與唱腔吻合，絲毫無問，水乳交融，蓋程派腔之琴，自以鐵芬爲首席，鐵芬之隨程硯秋，亦有十年故也，今除硯秋之周長華外，搜長程腔者寥寥可數。鐵芬有一徒李晋隆，即在台上爲配二胡之人，惟年事尙輕，經騐恐尙不足，此次倒底用誰操琴？雖善猜謎射覆之東方朔亦猜他不出，尙須待探馬一報也。</p>
<p>（編者按）據昨晚消息：章遏雲出演黃金，本已定局，忽又有中止之說，或係包銀問題，雙方尙未談妥，但紀玉良張雲溪等，仍將應邀也。</p>
<h3 id="c58">「殉情」觀後感 <a href="#c58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— 莊卓夫</p>
<p>蘭心大戲院上演之「殉情」，爲第八藝術劇團首次貢獻，該劇團係聖池劇校一部份學生與嚴化等所組織，原屬實騐性質，故技術人才均極齊全，外傳該劇已由導演李萍倩排練近一月之久，觀其昨日第一塲演出時之台詞，動作，裝置，燈光等，洵屬不虛。</p>
<p>該劇本的原作者是席勒，原名爲「戀愛與陰謀」，經顧仲彝君改編後，改成今名，故事是敘述民國初年北政府內閣的陰謀奸詐，狼狽爲奸，盡量利用地位，實施高壓手段，迫榨人家最後的一口氣，以自私自肥，造成自己在政治上更崇高的地位，結果陰謀家雖然是陷害了人，但因此也送終了自己的兒子，而在兒子臨死的一霎那前，給予陰謀的父親一服悲痛情緒之下的寬恕和懺悔，使陰謀家感到深切的創痛和覺悟，切實針砭世界上一切陰謀的共同結果，也是給予我們當前的一個極深刻而又綦重的敎訓。</p>
<p>全劇的台詞似覺太長，但也無法再能改短，一個大的舞台面上祇有二三個人的動作，加以較長的對白，不覺得討厭而能抓取觀衆的情緒漸漸緊張，却是難得。</p>
<p>演員如也魯之剛柔並施，嚴化則一掃過去之柔弱，及賀賓張琬沈敏之各盡其責，均値得提及，而楊碧君之香姐，亦頗盡烘雲托月之妙。</p>
<p>裝置及燈光在蘭心舞台上，當然是超人一等，音樂及效果尙佳，總之，在一般混濁空氣裏是極需要一架抽氣機來調劑一下，才能得到些微的淸醒。</p>

<p>— 金眞</p>
<p>在此時此地，游藝界的表面上看來似乎是有聲有色，其實它的內幕，實在很苦悶，有意義的劇本不能演出，就是能演出，一筆浩大的費用，也着實驚人。近年來歌舞方面更是沉寂，這因爲要運用大規模的人力和物力，實非易易，况且能不能吸引大量的覜衆，還是一個問題哩。</p>
<p>最近有一班俄國歌舞團，先在大光明戲院作一度的嘗試，表演得不差，竟賣了個滿堂，於是在本月的二十和二十一兩日再作第二度的演出，引起了愛好歌舞的士女們的注意，筆者也帶了顆嘗試的心，前去觀光。</p>
<p>院子裏坐滿了人。二十多位樂師全神貫注地在奏着各種樂器，那和諧的樂音確也美妙悅耳。當前奏曲奏完之後，在拍手聲中揭起了那張絲絨的幕，第一個節目是「詩人遊地獄」，這個劇本從前美國好萊塢會攝製電影，所以內容還不致十分的生疏，不過這次只摘取了其中的一小段，全以舞蹈來表演，倒也別開生面，計分三幕：第一幕便是詩人但丁遊地獄，看見魔鬼和罪人的靈魂在火熖中狂舞，滿臺全是融融的火光，相當的逼眞，舞得也很出力而動人。第二幕是倒敘一對情侶殉情的經過，頗有「羅密歐與朱麗葉」的情趣。第三幕仍是地獄中的舞蹈，表演得如火如荼，十分熱烈。</p>
<p>第二個節目是國際舞，把世界各國的名舞，作片段的演出，其中以印度舞的色彩，最爲艷麗；中國舞的表演，最有技巧；藍色的多瑙河，以男女五六對作華爾滋舞，最有意味；法國滑稽舞是李姓姊弟二人表演，男孩年紀雖很幼小，倒也相常的老練。第三個節目是「伊戈王子」，取材於俄國古代的史詩，五光十色的怪衣服，奇特別緻的怪舞蹈，富有東方的色彩，出塲的人物倒很多，可惜這一段史料，熟悉的人一定是很少的。</p>
<p>總之，這次演出所費的人力和物力確屬不少，表演得也算滿意，不失人望。據聞該團在下月還要作第三次的演出，並且更換精彩的新節目，一名「光與影」，一即表演埃及女王克麗巴特蘭史實的「傾國傾城」。</p>

<p>（二）袁美雲</p>
<p>袁美雲，遭是匹人中身世最可憐的一個，幼年便失去了最親愛的母親，由於家境淸貧，七歲時被父親賣在一個唱戲人袁樹德的家裏，因此袁美雲從小就唱得一口好京戲，十五歲那年，在某一次的機遇中爲當時天一影片公司導演裘芭香所賞識，就招她在天一主演「小女伶」一片，因爲成績不惡，以後又拍了兩部片子。不久藝華公司在當時崛起，他們攝製的片子如「中國海的怒潮」「烈燄」等，較之一般影片有意義得多，博得社會人士熱烈的贊美。裘芑香毅然拉了袁美雲一同加入藝華，她在該公司第一部主演的便是岳楓導演的「逃亡」，外景都在西北一帶實地攝製，旅途中就和該片男主角王引（那時叫王春元）發生了關係，等到回滬的時候，王引的未婚妻陸麗霞恰巧病死，不久他們就由訂婚而結婚。記得在結婚之前，王引就慫恿袁美雲和她的養父脫離關係，當時父女倆因此涉訟而哄動滬上。婚後又主演了「花燭之夜」「化身姑娘」等片，因爲她演技的老練動人，就一天天的紅了起來。民國二十五年新華公司大加擴充，以重金搜羅全滬第一流明星，那時他們夫婦倆就加入進去，先後主演的片子不下十餘部，去歲主演的古裝片「西施」，連從來不演國片的大光明戲院等也公映起來，其吸引力的强大，就可見一斑了。最近在滬公映的「家」，也認爲她在全片演技最好的一個，因此我們可以揣想她今日的成名確是下過一番苦功才得來的</p>

<h3 id="e1">Cripps Issues Statement Announcing India Aim: Prolonged Consultation on All Precise Measures to Fulfill Promise of Indian Autonomy. Formal Talks with Party Leaders Begin Today <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>New Delhi, 24th (Reuters): British Lord Privy Seal Sir Stafford Cripps attended a meeting of the Viceroy's Executive Council yesterday. Subsequently, General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army, met with Cripps in the evening. This morning, Cripps met with the governors of Madras, Bombay, and Bengal. Discussions with various Indian political leaders will begin tomorrow.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 23rd (Havas): The British special envoy to India, Sir Stafford Cripps, the Lord Privy Seal, hosted a reception for newspaper reporters today and issued a statement, saying, "I have come to your country as a 'great friend and ardent admirer of India,' intending to consult at length with the local authorities regarding certain preliminary conclusions reached by the London War Cabinet during discussions on the British-Indian problem. The aim of these conclusions is to draft various precise measures to fulfill the promise made in the past to grant autonomy to India. I sincerely hope that the recent British proposals will be accepted by India in a reasonable manner and that the major Indian political parties will prepare to make their utmost efforts during the current emergency. Once various issues are resolved in the future, the Indian nation will not only be united with Britain and other dominions but will also be in contact with the Soviet Union, Chongqing, and the United States. I plan to stay in this region for half a month, believing that this period is sufficient for us to resolve various important issues and ensure the success of our talks. My schedule for the first two days is to meet with the Governor-General of India, Lord Linlithgow, and I also intend to meet with the Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in India and the governors of various provinces. As for the Indian National Congress, the Muslim League, the Chamber of Princes, representatives from various sectors, and the premiers of various provinces, representatives will also be sent to meet with me at that time. I hereby request the cooperation of the newspapers in your region to support the great cause of Indian autonomy and self-defense. I believe that this matter will not cause misunderstandings or inaccurate reports. At this critical moment, the Indian people are filled with anxiety. I am very aware of this situation. Therefore, I will begin work in a spirit of equality to give comprehensive consideration to the views of Indians, Muslims, Sikhs, and other ethnic groups." Sir Stafford Cripps then answered questions from reporters, saying, "The plan proposed by the War Cabinet to the Indian people cannot be significantly altered on the British side. If it is said that the British Parliament will vote against and cancel this resolution, this is absolutely impossible. As for Mahatma Gandhi, although he is not a member of the National Congress and is not on the list of those meeting with me, I admire him, so I will be happy to catch a glimpse of his demeanor no matter what. Some say that my hope that the London proposal will be fully accepted is overly optimistic. It is not unexpected that this proposal is opposed by one party or a small number of political parties in India. Furthermore, rumors that Prime Minister Churchill and I have differing views on the entire Indian problem are also inaccurate, as the Prime Minister and I share the same views." Finally, at the request of all the reporters, Cripps decided to host reporters once every two days.</p>
<p>Sir Haye Khan Advocates:</p>
<p>Organizing a Central Body to Handle Common Interests</p>
<p>Lahore, 24th (Reuters): Sir Haye Khan, Premier of the Punjab, announced here last night his plan for resolving the Indian constitutional problem. It is said that all provinces of India should be completely autonomous, and the provinces should elect representatives to organize a central body to handle matters of common interest. The method of handling should involve both voting and mutual consultation.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 24th (Reuters): Jinnah, leader of the Muslim League, declared last night, "We are not a minority community but a nation. We are deeply aware of the true situation. We do not wish to constrain the British government, but we also do not wish to abet wrongdoing, so as to be oppressed by it after the war. Regarding the visit of Sir Stafford Cripps, we will not express any opinion on his plan for the time being. However, we are prepared to deal with any solution that harms our interests. We are determined to resist any conspiracy led by Indian Hindus or the British until our death."</p>

<p>Washington, 23rd (Havas): Haitian President Lescot arrived here today to discuss national defense and shipping issues with the United States. After visiting Undersecretary of State Welles, he issued a statement saying that he is determined to fight alongside the United States in the future.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 24th (Haitong): According to well-informed sources, the American Defense Conference will be held here in the near future. The representatives attending this conference will elect a standing defense committee. Therefore, Argentina and other countries will not send special representatives but will only be represented by naval and military attachés.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 24th (Haitong): After the Pan-American Conference established a committee to investigate non-American activities, Uruguayan Foreign Minister Guani has formally invited Argentina, Chile, Mexico, and Brazil to meet in Montevideo on the 15th of next month.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 24th (Haitong): According to well-informed sources, the Argentine military delegation has left Washington because they could not purchase arms in the United States. It is said that the delegation submitted a written statement of their needs before departing.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Willkie Declares: Unwilling to Serve in Government; Will Express His Ambitions in the Election Two Years Hence <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>New York, 24th (Havas): Republican leader Wendell Willkie published an article in the "Look" pictorial weekly today, saying, "What I see now is a careless attitude toward the war, the unravelling of economic life, and the gradual disillusionment of hopes for creating a better world after the war. I will naturally express my ambitions in the 1944 election." Tracing back to after the attack on the naval base at Pearl Harbor, I wrote to the President, stating my unwillingness to hold an official position in the current government but my willingness to cooperate as an American citizen in the national war effort, with one condition: that I would not accept any position that would limit my freedom of speech or deprive me of the right to criticize the policies and war efforts of the current government. Judging from the current situation, the New Deal faction still intends to promote its social and economic revolution in the United States. The crux of the difficulty in devising a concerted war effort lies in this."</p>
<p>Lisbon, 24th (Haitong): According to a speech by Willkie, the U.S. Navy should allow black people to enlist, and the attitude of discriminating against people of color must be abandoned.</p>
<h3 id="e4">German and Italian Forces Attack British Convoy in the Mediterranean; Italy Claims to Have Sunk a British Cruiser <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>German Supreme Headquarters, 24th (Haitong): According to a special war report issued by the German High Command, German submarines sank thirteen enemy ships off the coast of the Americas, totaling 80,300 tons, including seven oil tankers. A 2,000-ton transport ship was also severely damaged and is presumed to have sunk. German and Italian aircraft attacked a convoy heading to Malta in the Mediterranean, sinking three merchant ships totaling 18,000 tons, and destroying three merchant ships, one cruiser, and one destroyer.</p>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Haitong): The German High Command announced yesterday afternoon that a British convoy carrying important supplies, heading to the Mediterranean, was attacked by German aircraft. The convoy departed from Alexandria, and the attack occurred between Crete and Sicily. The ships must have been carrying important supplies, as each giant ship was protected by multiple warships. German aircraft concentrated on bombing the merchant ships, resulting in the sinking of one 6,000-ton merchant ship, one 5,000-ton merchant ship catching fire, and another being disabled after being hit.</p>
<p>Rome, 23rd (Havas): Official news, a British convoy, which was en route to Malta yesterday, was suddenly discovered by Italian aircraft, and immediately launched a brave attack. As a result, in addition to sinking one 10,000-ton cruiser and two cargo ships, it also severely damaged two of their warships and several other cargo ships. The convoy was scattered in all directions by this fierce attack, and some of them had already turned back. According to the latest reports, this convoy consisted of eight to ten merchant ships, escorted by five cruisers and seven destroyers. The attack took place approximately midway between the Italian island of Sicily and Libyan North Africa (35 degrees north latitude, 18 degrees east longitude). In addition to the air battle that lasted all day yesterday, German and Italian air forces have been continuously patrolling the central Mediterranean this morning to search for escaping British ships.</p>
<p>London, 23rd (Havas): The Admiralty issued a communiqué today stating that two of our submarines attacked two enemy submarines and two supply ships, as well as one troop transport steamer and six sailing ships in the Mediterranean, achieving considerable success.</p>
<p>North African Warfare Becomes Increasingly Active</p>
<p>Rome, 23rd (Havas): Military sources say that the battles on the North African front, especially in the areas of Benghazi and Tobruk, have become increasingly active in recent days. This is a sign that a major battle is about to occur. For several days, light and heavy artillery units from both sides have been sporadically shelling each other. These attacks are exploratory in nature, in order to discover the weakest points in the enemy's defensive positions. However, in the past 48 hours, an attempt by the British to break through or at least approach the Axis outposts has clearly failed. This is because the superiority of the joint German-Italian land, sea, and air forces is beyond doubt. At the same time, repeated British attempts to transport supplies to supply soldiers in North Africa and even Malta have also been thwarted by Axis forces. As for other aspects of the situation, they are also favorable to the Axis powers. In any case, spring will be the decisive phase of the North African war.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Intense Fighting on the Central and Northern Sections of the Soviet Front <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>German Supreme Headquarters, 24th (Haitong): According to the German High Command, Soviet attacks on the Kerch Peninsula and in the Donets River basin were repulsed. German forces in other areas of the Eastern Front have made progress.</p>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Haitong): According to an essay by Rear Admiral Gadot, naval correspondent for the "German General Report," the decisive battle location is currently unknown, but both warring parties are anticipating a decisive battle in the spring. The Eastern Front is likely to become the decisive battle location. The situation on the Eastern Front will affect the battles in North Africa and the Near East. Only if the Soviet forces defeat the German forces on the Eastern Front can other fronts threaten the Axis powers.</p>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Haitong): According to the German High Command, German tank units launched a successful localized offensive in eastern Qian on Sunday. The battle has been going on for several days in heavy snow and severe cold. Although the Soviet forces put up a strong resistance, the German forces, with the help of aircraft and artillery, occupied a Soviet artillery position. The enemy continued to retreat.</p>
<p>Rome, 24th (Haitong): News here last night indicated that the Italian forces on the Soviet front recently launched a fierce offensive.</p>
<p>Moscow, 24th (Reuters): According to official announcements, there is intense fighting on the Leningrad, Kalinin, and Central Fronts. In the Leningrad front, intense fighting has occurred for two days, resulting in the capture of small German fortresses and 30 machine-gun nests. In this battle, 1,800 German soldiers were killed. In the Kalinin sector, German forces occupying two strong defensive positions were driven out. On the Central Front, Soviet forces recaptured two important strongholds. German forces launched a counter-attack with armored vehicles to cover their infantry but suffered heavy losses and retreated. Last week, the German side lost 259 aircraft, while the Soviet side lost 77.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Alexander Gives Speech: Urging the British to Donate to the Warship Fund <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>London, 23rd (Havas): First Lord of the Admiralty, Alexander, took the occasion of "Navy Week" to give a speech, saying, "Although the number of merchant ships we have lost is not large compared to the vast shipping that we must maintain across the seven seas, in terms of losses, it is indeed very significant. Our country needs more ships. Every citizen must do their utmost within their individual financial means to donate to the warship fund. We are building a large number of ships, of course, but the Germans are constantly attacking us in the Atlantic, without a moment's rest. Fortunately, the officers and soldiers of our navy and the sailors of our merchant ships have been able to maintain their spirit of sacrifice and fight bravely, standing firm until now. Furthermore, we must especially remember that since Japan entered the war, the crisis we face at sea has become even more profound." Chancellor of the Exchequer, Wood, then gave a speech, saying, "We have deep confidence, but we must realize that our work is extremely arduous. In the future, only the nation that first completes the production of large quantities of aircraft, tanks, warships, and other new-style military equipment will be victorious. Our powerful enemy is trying to defeat our country, so we should save as much as possible on personal expenses and devote all our income to the nation's life-and-death struggle."</p>
<h3 id="e7">Macarthur Goes to Australia via Peru; Macarthur Advocates Public Release of News <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Melbourne, 24th (Reuters): General MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the Southwest Pacific, declared to the press yesterday, "I do not advocate banning the release of news, but rather advocate reporting all news at any time. The truth must be told to the public." Regarding the details of General MacArthur's arrival in Australia, official sources here disclosed yesterday that General MacArthur and his party stayed on a certain island for three days and nights after arriving from Corregidor Island in Bataan, Philippines, waiting for the Flying Fortress to arrive and transport them to Australia.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 24th (Haitong): A dispatch from Washington last night stated that former U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre, explained the reason why General MacArthur, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Forces in the Philippines, left the Philippines, saying that MacArthur's departure seemed to indicate the weakness of the U.S. positions in the Bataan Peninsula, but this was not the case. His intention was to liberate the Philippines from the outside.</p>
<p>Washington, 23rd (Havas): U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre, said here today that the Japanese authorities have agreed to allow the International Red Cross to send a ship carrying certain kinds of food to Manila to provide relief to civilians and to transport elderly and infirm American expatriates back to their country. As for the military situation in the Philippines, our positions are not impregnable. Our resistance in the Bataan Peninsula and Corregidor Island is merely an effort to make the Japanese pay a considerable price for their advance. We do not have sufficient arms and supplies there to sustain ourselves for several years. The Japanese are now focusing all their efforts on Australia, but the distance between the U.S. and Australia is too great, and transportation and supplies are difficult.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 24th (Haitong): The military correspondent for the "Daily Express" wrote yesterday that the British Middle East Command will be reorganized. Whether General Auchinleck, Commander-in-Chief of the British Middle East Forces, Admiral Cunningham, Commander-in-Chief of the British Mediterranean Fleet, and Air Marshal Tedder will be replaced by younger officers has not been stated. However, Churchill has great faith in Auchinleck, so it is widely believed that Auchinleck will not be affected by this.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 24th (Haitong): According to a Japanese naval spokesman, the enemy may adopt guerrilla tactics against Japan. The enemy forces may currently use Hawaii, New Zealand, and Samoa as bases to attack Japanese forces. Some Japanese people believe that Japan's development of resources in the South Seas is no longer threatened by attacks from other countries. However, the development of resources still involves transportation and other issues that must be resolved first. Currently, Japanese forces must continue to adopt an offensive posture.</p>

<h3 id="e21">A Record of a Journey in the Indian Peninsula (II) <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>After being detained in Patiala for several days, we finally filmed a scene of peasant life in the Punjab. The sole task of farmers on the plains of northern India is to irrigate their fields. Although the British have built many canals here, the parched fields rely entirely on an old ox, its eyes covered, drawing water from the village well.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Delhi</p>
<p>On a bright winter afternoon, we arrived in the capital, Delhi, where we stopped for the night. For two thousand years, these war-torn city walls have witnessed the rise and fall of many dynasties. Delhi has the remains of old palaces, truly a great legacy of ancient India. It is said that most of Delhi's buildings were constructed in the four hundred years after the Mughal conquest of India. However, New Delhi and the old city coexist. What was once a sun-drenched plain has been developed by the British into a thriving city, filled with tree-lined avenues. From the All India War Memorial Arch, one can see the bronze statue of King George V, and the Viceroy's House two miles away. The official residences on both sides are magnificent, comparable to those in major European cities.</p>
<p>We planned to depart from Delhi, traverse India southwestward, reach Baroda along the border of Rajputana province, then head north into Indian Sandao, and finally take the Agra-Deccan Highway to Calcutta. Therefore, we visited key officials of the Ministry of Interior, and with their enthusiastic assistance, we set off for Jaipur, about two hundred miles from Delhi.</p>
<p>The tree-lined roads always filled us with wonder. Trees a hundred feet tall, with trunks ten spans in circumference and dense foliage, arched over the roadside in two or three rows. Long-tailed gray monkeys swung from treetop to treetop, making faces at passing cars.</p>
<p>Everywhere along the road, we encountered nuisances to automobiles: long trains of oxcarts. Whether the carts were pulled by yellow oxen or water buffaloes, one thing was always the same—the drivers were always fast asleep, making us often wonder if the god of sleep had suffocated them to death. The horn had to be sounded especially long to be effective (we later broke the horns on the Buick cars), thus dragging each of the staggering beasts to the side of the road.</p>
<p>Beware of Hitting Cows</p>
<p>If one were to hit a sacred Indian cow, it would be unfortunate for the driver, and his troubles would be no small matter! Hitting a person would probably not be as serious a crime. Also, there are many peacocks in Rajputana. In some provinces, killing a long-tailed peacock is punishable by seven years of exile, but these birds often run across the road in front of cars in flocks.</p>
<p>Grit and Indian buses are two other unpleasant things. The grit is heavy, suffocating, and everywhere. It can even find its way into a tightly closed movie magazine inside the car. The buses are made by American manufacturers, with a capacity of one and a half tons, but they rarely carry passengers and luggage weighing less than three tons.</p>
<p>Our first stop after leaving Delhi was Alwar. British expatriates welcomed us in the drawing-rooms, and the Maharaja also granted us an audience. The hills we saw here were very low, the lowest we had seen in a thousand miles since leaving the Khyber Pass. We had now reached a dividing line. Northern India is predominantly Muslim, with about one hundred million Muslims, while the vast south is home to three hundred million Hindus. The north is Punjab, and the southwest is Rajputana.</p>
<p>Eighty-one miles from Alwar, we arrived at Jaipur, one of the four major cities in Rajputana province. The young Maharaja warmly welcomed us, and a very dignified entourage escorted us into the palace. The Maharaja had broken both legs in a plane crash several months ago and had recently been able to walk without a cane. He was once a famous international polo player, but is now forced to be inactive, much to his chagrin, and therefore could not accompany us on a tour of his state.</p>
<p>We toured the streets of Jaipur for a week. One day, we saw a wedding procession on the main street. First was a horse with a complete saddle but no rider, followed by an empty sedan chair (these two things were clearly intended to lengthen the procession); next was a band playing American tunes from fifteen years ago; behind them were the bridegroom and groomsmen sitting on an elephant, with magnificent and strong ivory tusks protruding in front of its legs; then came the bride, sitting in a covered sedan chair, and finally the bride and groom's bedding.</p>

<p>Ge Yisui, a local resident, 32 years old, an engineer at the Xindu Engineering Firm at 225 Tokyo Road, through the introduction of a White Russian named Robinson (38 years old, resident of 2 Luban Road), sold U.S. dollar bills totaling $1,306.20 to Bent, the owner of the Mute Foreign Firm at 241 Myers Road (53-year-old Russian), at a price of 27 yuan in legal tender per dollar, totaling 35,264.40 yuan, promising to deliver the legal tender the next day. At that time, Bent's Foreign Firm only issued a check for 30,000 yuan from the Moscow National Bank, handed it to Luo for safekeeping, and did not directly hand it to Ge. However, the check had to be received by the Chase Bank for settlement by Mute before it could be transferred to the Moscow Bank for withdrawal. Therefore, although Ge went to the Moscow Bank to withdraw the money, he was unable to do so. Bent and Robinson first delayed the date and then avoided meeting. Ge then realized that the two were colluding to defraud him and reported it to the authorities, who are currently investigating the evidence and taking statements from the defendants.</p>

<p>On March 21st, a grand assembly was held by the French community in Shanghai. On this day, nearly all the French residents in Shanghai, regardless of gender, age, official status, or profession, participated in an orderly manner in the annual general assembly initiated by the "French Military Personnel Association in China." The venue was the French Tennis Club on Myers Road. Before the meeting even began, the venue was packed, with all the original seats occupied. Latecomers had to add temporary chairs and benches in the aisles in order to listen to the speech by President Plessis.</p>
<p>The venue was decorated with the blue, white, and red tricolor flag, the emblem of the French Military Personnel Association in China, and a portrait of Marshal Pétain. In the VIP seats were the French Consul General and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Ma Jie Li, and the Commander-in-Chief of the French Defense Forces in China and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Ai Sha Di Ai. In addition, there were hundreds of veterans of the European War, members of the National Revolution Volunteer Corps, and French men and women, all filled with excitement, listening to the president report on the association's affairs.</p>
<p>Mr. Plessis first analyzed the difficulties faced by the French community in Shanghai, then clarified the necessity of spiritual unity and obedience to the leader, and reviewed the various undertakings carried out by the French Military Personnel Association in China in the past year, as well as the various tasks that should be improved in the future. He announced the contributions and tasks that the association should make to France, hoping that all French men and women in Shanghai would actively participate in the National Revolution Volunteer Corps recently organized by the association, in order to actively promote the work of revitalizing New France. The speech lasted for more than an hour, and all the listeners were moved by it. In the midst of enthusiastic applause from the audience, the adjournment was announced.</p>
<p>The "French Military Personnel Association in China," originally named L a Legion Framais e des Combattants de Chine, was established on March 22, 1941, exactly one year ago. The predecessor of the association was a "Veterans Association of the European War." Since last year, Marshal Pétain appointed Mr. Plessis as the president of the French Military Personnel Association in China, and absorbed 115 members of the Veterans Association into the Military Personnel Association. The first annual general assembly was held on May 10 last year, with a total of 140 members. Currently, there are 180 members in Shanghai; the North China branch of the association in Tianjin currently has more than 30 members, totaling more than 200 members in Tianjin and Shanghai.</p>
<p>Last year, the association launched a movement to慰劳prisoners of war. According to the original plan, it was intended to regularly mail慰劳品 to French prisoners of war held in concentration camps, but this could not be implemented due to the disruption of shipping. However, the association never lagged behind in initiating various charitable fundraising campaigns. According to statistics, the funds raised by the association were quite large, totaling more than 240,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Mr. Plessis, the president of the French Military Personnel Association in China, appealed loudly at the general assembly, urging French men and women in Shanghai to jointly register to participate in the association and respond to the "National Revolution Volunteer Corps" Volontaires de la Revolution Nationale, called for by Pétain. In his speech, he expounded Marshal Pétain's expectations for the French people around the world and praised his diligence and meritorious service. "We should follow the instructions of this great man who has saved France from danger twice. Under the unified sign, let us abandon the prejudices of the past, and everyone rush into his embrace. The only strength that France has is the moral movement to restore the motherland led by Marshal Pétain. This association calls on all French people to work together to participate in this arduous patriotic work. We must support the only supreme leader, under the only national flag, with only one common hope, our responsibility is to revive the motherland in times of crisis. The National Revolution does nothing else, just refines the national spirit and encourages the masses to work hard. You must permeate this concept every day and every hour, otherwise you will waste your energy and will not see your motherland revived. In every action in your life, you must remember that the motherland is in suffering, and from now on, you must shoulder the work of double hardship. Your only command is "service," and only through sacrifice can you obtain everything you expect." (Guest Writer)</p>

<p>According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency, the Municipal Council Finance Committee held a meeting the day before yesterday to discuss the Municipal Council's budget for 1942.

<p>It is also learned that the Municipal Council's Finance Department has compiled the Municipal Council's draft budget for this year based on the figures submitted by various bureaus and sections.

In this case, the Municipal Council's budget for this year will still have a deficit of more than 23 million yuan. Together with the previous year's financial deficit, the total will reach more than 30 million yuan. Therefore, how the Municipal Council will handle this huge deficit in the future is quite noteworthy.</p>

<p>It seems like just yesterday, Shanghai's nightlife was in its heyday, with lavish spending and dazzling entertainment. The city never slept, and countless enamored couples reveled day and night. Every entertainment venue was packed with customers. Especially the Western District nightclubs, shrouded in mystery, such as Eve's Tent, Falence, and Argentina, all catered to their customers' every whim. Besides fine wine and beautiful women, they also offered various forms of gambling to entice customers. Fortunately, they never lacked parasites willing to squander fortunes. As a result, nightclub owners grew fat and wealthy, just as they had envisioned.</p>
<p>However, the Shanghai concessions were not an isolated paradise. As the World War intensified, they were increasingly affected. Eventually, strict measures were implemented to conserve electricity, restrict gasoline, and shorten the operating hours of entertainment venues, as well as reduce public transportation. These measures dealt a series of heavy blows to the nightclubs, which already found it difficult to operate. More recently, they found it completely unsustainable. In what seemed like no time at all, Shanghai's entertainment industry was on the verge of collapse. The once brightly lit Western District nightclubs had become deserted and desolate!</p>
<p>Speaking of the Falence Nightclub on Great West Road, people in Shanghai not only knew it well, but many had also spent all night reveling there. The old man, George Falence, middle-aged and balding, bore a resemblance to the American comedy film star Roland Young. In the past, tourists often saw him wearing a tuxedo, circulating and entertaining guests. Falence, being a shrewd businessman, realized that the end of nightclubs was near. He resolutely changed course, turning the backyard of the Falence Nightclub into a farm. He shed his tuxedo, donned short sleeves, and personally supervised a team of Chinese and Western employees. He started with raising pigs and chickens. The exterior of the Falence Nightclub's brown building remained the same as before, but upon entering, everything had changed. The once joyous place filled with the aroma of wine and powder had transformed into a breeding ground for livestock, leaving one with a sense of the world's impermanence.</p>
<p>The Falence Farm is now divided into two sections, half for pigs and half for chickens. There are about three hundred chickens, distinguished by their feather color, each separated by wire mesh to prevent mixing. Interestingly, the wood used to build the red chicken coops was salvaged from the nightclub's gambling tables. The table surfaces, legs, and crossbeams were all dismantled and used to build the chicken coops, demonstrating Falence's determination in running the farm.</p>
<p>On the other side of the farm is a row of pigsties, twenty-five yards long, enclosing five yards. The ground is covered in mud. There were originally forty pigs of various sizes, and twelve more have recently been added. Soon, more will be added. In addition, he plans to raise three horses and other livestock. Falence places great importance on the feed for the chickens and pigs, as it is crucial to the farm's success. The pigs are fed mainly carrots, and the chickens are fed carefully selected grains, given on a strict schedule. It is said that Falence does not feel satisfied until the livestock have eaten their fill, and he himself is unwilling to dine. His dedication to running the farm is evident.</p>
<p>Falence not only supervises the feeding but also personally collects eggs and places them in incubators, checking the temperature. In his spare time, he plans how to improve and expand the farm, working tirelessly all day. According to Falence, he finds running the farm much more interesting than running the nightclub. So far, the results he has achieved are very satisfactory. The eggs produced by his farm are, on average, larger than those on the market, and everyone who has tasted them praises their deliciousness. The farm currently has about three hundred chickens, and as they gradually hatch, it will soon be able to increase to one thousand.</p>
<p>In these times, running a farm is indeed a secure business. Falence has transformed from the owner of a consumption venue to a producer, and his spirit is admirable.</p>

<h3 id="e46">Government Bonds Finally Rebound; Stocks Also Show Prosperity <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>In the gray market yesterday, government bonds saw a change of heart among both bulls and bears. It was realized that selling government bonds indiscriminately for other speculations was not a sustainable strategy. Market prices then rebounded by about one yuan. The shortsightedness of the sellers in pushing down prices had created opportunities for the bulls. Yesterday, firms like Tongkang, Wuhe, and Dakangcheng were seen covering their short positions, while Gongmao and Hu Heji showed strong buying interest. Tongyi, Xinhua, and Yuxing, among others, saw some selling, while Runde and Shunli had limited supply. However, the market showed signs of life, with demand exceeding supply. As a result, prices rebounded across the board by 9 jiao to 1.35 yuan. Trading volume was approximately 400,000 yuan. A simplified table is provided below.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks also rose sharply, with trading volume surging. A total of 19,700 shares were traded.

<p>Chinese stocks remained stable. Wing On at 75 yuan and Sincere at 80 yuan both saw trading. The market was flat, with only Da Sun rising by 2 yuan to 55-56 yuan. China Underwear (New) at 19.25 yuan and World Book Company (New) at 50.50 yuan to 51 yuan both saw trading. Commercial Press was traded at 197.50 yuan, China at 117.50 yuan, Nanyang Brothers Tobacco around 56 yuan, French (New) at 47.25 yuan, New Asia (New) at 33-34 yuan, and Science at 11-12 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Cash Plunges Suddenly in the Afternoon <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>580 Yuan Higher Than the Previous Day</p>
<p>Yesterday, the black market for cash saw wild fluctuations, rising sharply before suddenly falling back. After breaking through the 19,000 yuan mark, it immediately retreated. Following the bullish momentum of the previous evening, news suddenly broke that silver shops had received registration notices. Buyers rushed out en masse. However, the remaining chips in the city were scarce, resulting in extremely thin trading. The initial opening price in the morning was 18,200 yuan per bar (ten taels), 480 yuan higher than the closing price of the previous afternoon, and 100-200 yuan higher than the off-market price in the afternoon. Shengda Yong Securities and a certain gold shop, along with individual investors, aggressively bought and pushed up the price. Sellers were hesitant, and the price soared by 1,250 yuan, breaking through the 19,000 yuan mark and reaching a high of 19,450 yuan. Suddenly, silver shops, gold shops, and major banks began to sell, and rumors of profit-taking also emerged. Gonghe, Defu, Tongkang, Yong, and others scrambled to sell, and the price gradually declined, becoming difficult to recover. It plummeted by a total of 1,150 yuan, falling directly to a closing price of 18,300 yuan at noon, 580 yuan higher than the closing price of the previous afternoon, and 200-300 yuan higher than the off-market price in the afternoon. There was a high-low difference of 1,250 yuan in the morning. In the afternoon, the price initially retreated to 18,000 yuan before suddenly rising to 18,900 yuan.</p>
<p>The price of gold jewelry in silver shops was first raised twice by Daxin and other shops, increasing by 100 yuan to 2,000 yuan per tael. Then it retreated, settling at 1,900 yuan. In the afternoon, it rose again by 50 yuan to 1,950 yuan (buying price reduced by 200 yuan). Fine silver was traded at 20 yuan. The black market price was 14 yuan, with buyers present. Silver dollars also rose to 8.50 yuan.</p>
<p>The market situation for foreign currencies yesterday: British and American gold pounds were stable, remaining at 410 yuan and 420 yuan, respectively. American dollar bills rose sharply to 24-25 yuan. Hong Kong dollar bills remained at 3.50 yuan, with large bills discounted by 1 jiao. Military scrip rose to 7.90 yuan before retreating to 5.30 yuan, eventually settling at 7.65 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Profit-Taking Emerges; Yarn Prices Return to Flat <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market started high but then flattened out, although the overall trend remained firm. In reality, the consecutive days of price increases had been quite significant, prompting some profit-takers to sell. As a result, the market initially rose but then flattened out. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse brand yarn was 3,480 yuan. However, due to long positions being closed out, it eased to 3,400 yuan. Nevertheless, spot prices remained stable, and with Japanese yarn being quite firm, it rose again to 3,560 yuan. Subsequently, rumors of negative news emerged, causing it to plummet to 3,400 yuan. By the close, it had rebounded to 3,460 yuan. 42-count Blue Phoenix was traded at 8,800 yuan to 9,000 yuan, with the final price being 8,500 yuan. 60-count Rainbow Ball was traded at 20,500 yuan, 60-count Sunlight at 20,500 yuan, 40-count Sunlight at 8,400 yuan, 20-count Yueqin at 4,850 yuan, 20-count Fengnian at 5,100 yuan, 20-count Double Tiger at 4,700 yuan, 20-count Double Horse at 4,530 yuan to 4,420 yuan, 20-count Double Globe at 4,370 yuan, 16-count Red Kui Xing at 4,450 yuan, 16-count Golden Bridge at 4,540 yuan, 10-count Cai Bao Yi at 2,950 yuan, 10-count Boy Scout at 3,250 yuan, and 18-count Weaver Girl at 4,570 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Cloth Prices Did Not Fall Much <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>The cloth market started high but then weakened, as some holders took advantage of the sharp price increases to sell. However, inventories were thin, so closing prices were only slightly lower than the previous day. 16-pound coarse cloth Flying Goose brand 170 yuan to 168 yuan, Globe brand 180 yuan to 178 yuan, Flower Butterfly brand spot price quoted at 200 yuan, mill order 120 yuan, Big Eagle fine cloth 75 yuan to 73 yuan, Fugui fine cloth 73 yuan to 72 yuan, White Cat calico 132 yuan, Chick, Meiting, Guizi, Peach Girl, and Shilin cloth around 255 yuan, light colors around 220 yuan, Longevity plain silk 6.05 yuan, Mermaid bleached cloth 165 yuan, Lunchang Croton silk 130 yuan. Over 400 pieces were traded on the street.</p>
<p>The Eastern Cloth market started slightly higher due to rumors of impending registration of yarn and cloth, but then immediately declined. Longtou fine cloth new mill order 214 yuan, opening high at 216.15 yuan, gradually declining to 206 yuan, closing in the afternoon starting at 204 yuan, falling to 200 yuan, then rebounding to 204.50 yuan, but selling pressure increased again, falling to 201 yuan. The closing price was down 12 yuan per bolt compared to the previous day. The decline was even more pronounced for Longtou spot goods, only 179 yuan, Flying Fish Rainbow Ball 182 yuan, Yanghe 180 yuan, Trumpet 177 yuan, Wufu 170 yuan, Baby fine twill 150 yuan, Four Gentlemen Serge mill order for October-December 6.23 yuan, Red Order new tax 6 yuan, spot goods 5.75 yuan, also down significantly by 4-5 jiao per yard.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Woolens Increase More and More Vigorously <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Due to dwindling production and market scarcity, wool, cotton, silk, yarn, hemp, and other related woolen goods, merchants have switched to using military scrip and Central Reserve notes for transactions, whether old or new legal tender. Insiders and outsiders are aggressively hoarding, causing prices to rise steadily. Retail sales remain brisk. Looking at the recent wool market, there is a strong trend of higher prices leading to even more trading. Owners are unwilling to release large quantities (due to difficulties in replenishing stocks), taking a wait-and-see approach until after April 12th. However, those who need them are willing to pay high prices, resulting in brisk sales of all colors and styles for spring, summer, autumn, and winter.</p>
<h3 id="e51">The Grains Market is Confused <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the grains market was mixed, as most transactions were small-scale and spot-driven. Large investors rarely showed interest, resulting in mixed sentiment and fluctuating prices. As a result, except for soybeans, which rose by about 10 yuan, the rest generally hovered around the same levels. 200 packages of Tianjin Jinyuan were sold, priced at 220 yuan to 228 yuan. Another 100 packages of green beans were sold, priced at 110 yuan to 112 yuan. 50 packages of Pudong Doudou were sold, priced at 205 yuan to 208 yuan. 30 packages of Wuhu soybeans were sold, priced at 205 yuan. 60 packages of Chongming Shawang were sold, priced at 210 yuan. Another 300 packages of Shacha silkworms were sold, priced at 255 yuan to 245 yuan. 200 packages of Xasha red beans were sold, priced at 200 yuan to 204 yuan. 50 packages of Yangzhou red beans were sold, priced at 205 yuan. 100 packages of Tianjin red beans were sold, priced at 205 yuan. 200 packages of Benniu red beans, high-quality at 190 yuan, lower-quality at 175 yuan to 170 yuan. Over 100 packages of cowpeas were sold, priced at 190 yuan to 195 yuan. 50 packages of Zhangjiakou tea beans were sold, priced at 245 yuan. 200 packages of Tianjin mung beans were sold, priced at 218 yuan to 200 yuan. 50 packages of Nanjing snow sesame were sold, priced at 295 yuan. 1,000 pieces of Hankou bean cakes were sold, priced at 38 yuan. Yuanlong bean cakes for March, warehouse receipt for stale goods 37.10 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Sugar Prices Tightening <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Sugar prices have risen with the continued rise in military scrip, and combined prices have also risen accordingly. Compared to last week, prices have increased by about 80 yuan. Otherwise, if calculated based on the black market, the increase is likely more than that, possibly even several hundred yuan. It is said that door prices are also increasing daily.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Forced to Quit Smoking Naturally; Cigarette Sales are Sluggish <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Cigarette prices have been rising like kites for days, becoming increasingly high. Yesterday, the market retreated slightly by 800 yuan, as general merchants slightly reduced their purchases due to the high prices and sluggish sales. British brands were opened at 10,700 yuan per carton, Old Dao brand at 9,300 yuan, Little Fairy brand at 6,300 yuan, Wuhua brand at 6,200 yuan, Pinhai brand at 8,000 yuan, Japanese Kimigayo brand at 3,060 yuan, Golden Building at 3,350 yuan, Quanlu brand at 3,500 yuan, Domestic Big Beautiful brand at 5,800 yuan. Looking at the future market trend, it will be difficult to rise further without speculative manipulation. In addition, many old smokers have stopped smoking, naturally quitting, which is inevitable.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Factors Causing Coal Briquette Panic; Unscrupulous Merchants Hoarding and Raising Prices <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Recently, Shanghai's fuel problem, due to inconvenient transportation and insufficient production to meet demand, has led to a shortage of coal briquettes, a daily necessity for residents, for nearly a month. Everyone is complaining. In addition, small coal shops, such as a certain company on Route Lafayette, Rue Gara, French Concession, received one ton or half a ton of Nanyang coal briquettes but did not immediately sell them. Instead, they closed their doors and put up a sign saying "Old customers' goods have not yet been fully distributed", deceiving residents. Later, it was found that the coal briquettes received by the company could only be purchased if someone offered a high price of 30 yuan extra per load.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Smiling Faces Cannot Hide; The Merchants of Today <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Financial turmoil brings the most joy to those who speculate on paper money and hoard goods, as well as food shops. Their goods are priced to rise three or four times as the currency depreciates, forcing customers to pay with the current prevailing currency, resulting in considerable profits. The gains from the price increases are more than three or four times their original cost. In addition, cotton yarn merchants, cloth merchants, and match, soap, and cigarette merchants are making unprecedented profits. Rice merchants, flour merchants, and grain merchants are also prosperous, looking down on the world. Turning dirt into gold is indeed true. Today's gold has lost its luster and should be ashamed. Those who are slightly inconvenienced are general industrial and commercial businesses, whose assets are calculated in legal tender. Although they can recover through commodity prices, they ultimately feel the loss invisibly. Those who suffer the most are consumers, who are heavily exploited and burdened at every level. Equalizing wealth and poverty is gradually becoming a reality. A skilled poet has written: "Commodity prices soar to the sky, currency values plummet to the ground, three times and four times back and forth, gold is just a wisp of smoke."</p>
<h3 id="e56">Apple (II) <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>Because the ancient Hebrew people's land of Palestine had long been in frequent contact with Egypt, Egypt also had apple trees cultivated very early on. According to the investigations of European archaeologists, during the time of the Egyptian king Ramses II—1330 to 1270 BC—many apple trees had already been transplanted into the royal gardens on the Nile Delta. King Ramses III, to provide the priests of Thebes with daily offerings for worshipping the gods, sent them 848 baskets of apples! (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e57">Zhang Eyun's QIN player "Mystery" <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>Cheng School Tsing Yi Zhang Eyun's Northern tour of Beijing and Tianjin, intended to take her sister Yiyun with her, in order to let her sister personally see the Beijing school drama, to learn and deepen her art. Since leaving, it has been almost a year, with two pieces of news, one fortunate and one unfortunate. The unfortunate news is that her Qin player Mu Tiefen suddenly died of a stroke. The fortunate news is that Eyun has received a golden invitation, and will come south to follow Qilin Tong. The supporting actors she is bringing are Lao Sheng Ji Yuliang, and Xiao Sheng Ye Shenglan, etc. Shenglan often pairs with Eyun as Xiao Sheng, with the beauty of familiarity. Ji Yuliang last year in Golden Straight rose three levels, suddenly became the headline name, his good luck, the speed of promotion, is rare in the performing world. Now he is willing to descend the ranks as a supporting actor, much like Yang Baosen's condescension to Cheng Yanqiu, both are outstanding people who recognize the times. Someone said: "Eyun's collaboration with Golden last year was originally Yang Baosen's second billing, why is Baosen not being used now, but Ji Yuliang, who is newly arrived?" I say: there is a reason. In the past, Li Ji of the Tang Dynasty, and Yue Fei of the Song Dynasty, whenever they faced a major battle, they would personally observe the faces of the soldiers, and select those whose faces had radiance, with auspicious stars shining, and say: "Fighting is such an important matter, life and death, honor and disgrace, depend on the moment, if it is not good luck, how can there be a reason to win?" Now Eyun's selection of Yuliang, and Golden's additional hiring, both obtain the meaning of ancient famous generals facing battle. Singing a play is just like using troops, this time will surely be a complete victory, it can be known without divination. Only Tiefen is already dead, who will play the Qin for her, is a mystery. Tiefen has followed Eyun to play the Qin for ten years, the Qin and the singing fit together, without any question, blending like water and milk. The Qin of the Cheng school's tune, Tiefen is considered the chief, Tiefen followed Cheng Yanqiu, also for ten years. Now, apart from Yanqiu's Zhou Changhua, there are very few who know Cheng's tune well. Tiefen has a disciple, Li Jinlong, who is on stage as a second Huqin player, but he is still young, and his experience is probably not enough. Who will play the Qin this time? Even the Eastfang Shuo, who is good at guessing riddles, cannot guess it, it is still necessary to wait for the scout's report.</p>
<p>(Editor's note) According to last night's news: Zhang Eyun's performance at Golden was already finalized, but suddenly there is talk of cancellation, possibly due to the issue of the fee, and the two sides have not yet reached an agreement, but Ji Yuliang, Zhang Yunxi, etc., will still be invited.</p>
<h3 id="e58">After Viewing "Love Suicide" <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— Zhuang Zhuofu</p>
<p>"Love Suicide," staged at the Lyceum Theatre, is the first contribution of the Eighth Art Troupe. The troupe is composed of some students from the Shengchi Drama School and Yan Hua, etc., and is of an experimental nature, so the technical talent is very complete. It is rumored that the play has been rehearsed by director Li Pingqian for nearly a month. Viewing its first performance yesterday, the lines, movements, sets, lighting, etc., were indeed true.</p>
<p>The original author of the play is Schiller, and the original name was "Love and Intrigue." After Mr. Gu Zhongyi's adaptation, it was changed to the current name. The story tells about the conspiracy and treachery of the Northern government's cabinet in the early years of the Republic of China. They colluded with each other, and made full use of their positions to implement high-pressure tactics, forcing out the last breath of the people, in order to selfishly enrich themselves and create an even more lofty position for themselves in politics. As a result, although the conspirators harmed people, they also sent their own son to his death. In the moment before his son died, he gave his conspiring father forgiveness and repentance under the influence of grief, making the conspirator feel deep pain and realization, thoroughly criticizing the common result of all conspiracies in the world, and also giving us a very profound and important lesson today.</p>
<p>The lines of the whole play seem too long, but it is impossible to shorten them any further. On a large stage, there are only two or three people moving, coupled with longer dialogues, but it is rare that it does not feel annoying and can gradually capture the audience's emotions and make them tense.</p>
<p>The actors such as Ye Luzhi, who combined softness and strength, Yan Hua, who swept away the past weakness, and He Bin, Zhang Wan, and Shen Min, who all did their best, are worth mentioning, and Yang Bijun's Xiang Jie also fully plays the beauty of the foil.</p>
<p>The sets and lighting on the Lyceum stage are of course superior, and the music and effects are also good. In short, in a generally turbid atmosphere, an exhaust fan is needed to regulate it, so that one can get a little clarity.</p>

<p>At this time and in this place, the entertainment scene appears vibrant on the surface, but its inner workings are actually quite depressing. Meaningful scripts cannot be performed, and even if they can, the enormous costs involved are truly astonishing. In recent years, song and dance performances have been even more subdued, as it is not easy to mobilize large-scale human and material resources. Moreover, whether they can attract a large audience remains a question.</p>
<p>Recently, a Russian dance troupe made a first attempt at the Grand Theater, performing quite well and selling out the house. As a result, they performed a second time on the 20th and 21st of this month, attracting the attention of song and dance enthusiasts. The writer also went to see the performance with a spirit of curiosity.</p>
<p>The theater was filled with people. More than twenty musicians were intently playing various instruments, and the harmonious music was indeed beautiful and pleasant. After the overture was played, the velvet curtain was raised to applause. The first program was "Poet's Journey to Hell." This play had previously been made into a movie by Hollywood in the United States, so the content was not entirely unfamiliar. However, this time, only a small section was extracted and performed entirely through dance, which was quite novel. It was divided into three acts: The first act was Dante's journey through hell, where he saw demons and the souls of sinners dancing wildly in the flames. The entire stage was filled with glowing flames, which was quite realistic, and the dancing was very energetic and moving. The second act was a flashback to the story of a pair of lovers who committed suicide for love, reminiscent of "Romeo and Juliet." The third act was still a dance in hell, performed with great fervor and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The second program was an international dance, featuring excerpts from famous dances from various countries. Among them, the Indian dance was the most colorful, the Chinese dance the most skillful, the Blue Danube Waltz, danced by five or six couples, the most meaningful, and the French comic dance was performed by the Li siblings, the boy being very young but quite experienced. The third program was "Prince Igor," based on an ancient Russian epic, with colorful and bizarre costumes and unique dances, rich in Eastern colors. There were many characters on stage, but unfortunately, there must be few people familiar with this historical material.</p>
<p>In short, the human and material resources spent on this performance were considerable, and the performance was considered satisfactory and met expectations. It is said that the troupe will perform a third time next month, with new and exciting programs, one called "Light and Shadow," and the other a performance of the historical story of Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt, called "Alluring Beauty."</p>

<p>(2) Yuan Meiyun</p>
<p>Yuan Meiyun is perhaps the most pitiable of these figures. She lost her beloved mother at a young age, and due to poverty, her father sold her to the family of an opera singer named Yuan Shude when she was seven years old. As a result, Yuan Meiyun learned to sing Peking Opera very well from a young age. At the age of fifteen, she was discovered by Qiu Baxiang, the director of Tianyi Film Company, during a chance encounter, and he recruited her to star in the film "Little Actress." Because the results were not bad, she then made two more films. Soon, Yihua Company rose to prominence at that time, and their films, such as "Raging Tide of the China Sea" and "Flames," were more meaningful than ordinary films, earning enthusiastic praise from the public. Qiu Baxiang resolutely took Yuan Meiyun with him to join Yihua. Her first starring role in that company was "The Fugitive," directed by Yue Feng. The outdoor scenes were all filmed on location in the Northwest. During the journey, she became involved with Wang Yin (then called Wang Chunyuan), the male lead of the film. When they returned to Shanghai, Wang Yin's fiancée, Lu Lixia, happened to die of illness, and soon they went from engagement to marriage. I remember that before the marriage, Wang Yin encouraged Yuan Meiyun to sever ties with her adoptive father. At that time, the father and daughter were involved in a lawsuit that caused a sensation in Shanghai. After the marriage, she starred in films such as "Wedding Night" and "Incarnation Girl." Because of her skilled and moving acting, she became more and more popular day by day. In 1936, Xinhua Company greatly expanded and spent a lot of money to gather the best stars in Shanghai. At that time, she and her husband joined the company. She has starred in no less than a dozen films. The costume drama "Xi Shi," which she starred in last year, was even screened by the Grand Theater, which had never shown domestic films before, showing its powerful appeal. Recently, "The Family," which was released in Shanghai, also recognized her as having the best acting in the entire film. Therefore, we can speculate that her fame today is indeed the result of hard work.</p>

<p>(2) Sorrow and Joy</p>
<p>The Ye family began to hold the funeral. Wei Cheng knelt on the ground and wailed loudly, his cries flying through the rooms, flying into the ears of everyone related to the Ye family of Shide Hall. In the past, Madam Ye the Elder presided over the affairs of the Ye family; after Madam Ye the Elder fell ill, Madam Ye the Second presided over them; now it should be Madam Ye the Second. She invited the Eldest Aunt, the Second Aunt, and the Li couple to discuss the funeral arrangements. This is the responsibility of those who survive, and they cannot simply ignore it because of grief. Father Li and others wiped their tearful eyes and said, "Everything is up to Second Sister-in-law. Today is the 28th day of the lunar month, and the day after tomorrow is New Year's Eve. The encoffining should be completed tomorrow. Our siblings, aunts, and sisters-in-law have always had very close relationships, but the dead cannot be brought back to life. According to the Ye family's usual rules, there must be a three-day funeral, which should be changed." Madam Ye the Second's handkerchief was soaked with tears, but she still used it to wipe her face, saying, "After she fell ill, she said a lot of irrelevant things, saying that we sisters-in-law were going to separate. I only thought she was saying it out of anger, but who knew she really put a heavy burden on my shoulders. And Wei Cheng, his father died when he was three years old. The two of us women raised him to this age. How can we let him become motherless again? Alas!" Madam Ye the Second originally invited Li and others to discuss the funeral arrangements, but the discussion aroused her grief, and she only cried.</p>
<p>A message came out that Wei Cheng had fainted from crying and fallen to the ground, scaring Sister Cui Zhen. Madam Ye the Second grabbed the Eldest Aunt's hand and ran in, helping Wei Cheng up and stroking his chest. Like a frightened bird, Madam Ye the Second gasped and only said, "What to do? What to do?" (32)</p>

<p>— Jun Yi</p>
<p>Zhou Xuan previously fell off a bicycle and fractured the joint of her left leg. This newspaper reported that after being sent to the hospital for treatment, her injury has gradually improved, and she can avoid amputation. According to the doctor, it will be difficult for her to return to the screen in the future because her walking will be abnormal after recovery.</p>
<p>Since returning to Shanghai, the veteran star Yang Naimei is currently inviting people from the film circle to organize a theater troupe. The first play, "Wang Xifeng Makes a Scene at Lord Ran's Mansion," is in the process of renting a theater.</p>
<p>The new play of the Shanghai Art Troupe, following "The Strange Man Upstairs," is "Four Sisters," written by Fang Junyi and directed by Sima Yingcai.</p>
<p>Song Dezhu, the famous martial arts actress who had previously reached an agreement with Gengxin last year, is scheduled to go south in mid-April. The two parties have signed a contract.</p>
<p>Martial arts actor Wang Shaolou will hold a wedding ceremony with Xin Guiqiu today (the 25th) at Zhimelou. The day after tomorrow, he will respond to the invitation of the Zhenjiang Fuxing Theater and perform on that stage.</p>
