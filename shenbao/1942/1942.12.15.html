<p>社評</p>
<h3>冬賑</h3>
<p>上海依然是繁榮的大都市，不只是中國的第一個大都市，而且在全東亞範圍內，從市面之繫華和生活享受的奢侈說，恐怕也是「首屈一指」的。然而，我們仔細一觀察，就會發覺，上海在戰爭五六年以後的今日，依然保持着的繁華富裕，是畸形的繁華富裕，是違反大東亞戰爭目標的繁華富裕，是少數人利用戰爭時期的特點漁利發財的繁華富裕，揭開這繁華富裕的面幕，便是驚人的沒落。貧困，整個中下層市民在生死綫上掙扎着。但是，我們要知道，上海四百多萬人口中，在今日被逼過而陷入「隱貧」「赤貧」的中下層市民，是佔着絕對最大多數的；而且這些市民，才正是協力大東亞戰爭的基本力量。如果任令這些市民沒落和貧困，只剩下少數，新貴和鉅窗，而仍高唱協力大東亞戰爭，那簡直是不可想像的事。所以挽救上海廣大的中下層的命運，拯救那些「隱貧」「赤貧」的大衆，是目前當局和社會各界領袖的重要任務，而冬賑就是這個任務中的主要工作。</p>
<p>冬賑並不是新奇的運動，幾乎已被看做「年常舊規」，過去幹過這套工作的，每到冬季，就來虛應故事的辦一下冬賑，就使中間也有認眞出力辦理的，究竟也因爲人力物力有限，而且只注重於消極的賑濟，成效自然有了限制。現今是在大東亞戰爭的非常時期，今年辦冬賑便和過去的冬賑含有不同的意義，今年的冬賑，是必須含有積極的意義了，就是說，要求經過冬賑，以挽救陷於末路的隱貧和赤貧階層的命運，要求經過冬賑，以集結上海一般中下層市民的力量，進一步成爲協助當局推行一切有利於新上海和有助於大東亞戰爭的偉大力量。</p>
<p>在這具有嶄新的意義的今年的冬賑中，我們一定要有適應一種意義的辦法：第一，我們熱誠地希望當局認淸今年冬賑的特別需要和意義，針對上海社會的實際情形，尤其是洞察廣大隱貧份子和赤貧階層的實際情形，聽取各界領袖與專家的意見，迅速規定今年冬賑的基本方針和實施辦法綱要，以期推進有計劃有組織有步驟的冬賑運動。當局還要在冬賑的實施過程中，站在協助的地位，並且隨時隨地不放鬆監督的責任，使今年的冬賑，在統一的推行中收穫美滿的成果。</p>
<p>第二，冬賑工作的實施者，自然不是當局而是社會原有各慈善團體和各界領袖，不過鑒於過去各團體在冬賑工作中缺乏密切的聯系，和互相配合的計劃，以致不免有倚輕倚重和顧此失彼的現象，而難期成果的美滿。今年的冬賑，必須在當局一定的冬賑運動方針和領導之下，按照一定的步驟，切實推行；同時，各慈善團體，尤當以遠大的眼光，勿存界域宗派的觀念，互相連絡，互相照顧，完全做到「分工合作」的一點，使大家的精力和財力沒有一絲一毫的浪費，都能獲得相當的效果。同時也使受賑濟的隱貧和赤貧者，普遍地受到實際利益，沒有少數人受到多方面的賑濟而多數人有「向隅」之憾。</p>
<p>第三，關於賑濟的對象，必須有充分的認識。我們認爲今年的冬賑，除了赤貧之外，尤須注意「隱貧」。所謂赤貧，是無衣無食無家可歸的流浪者或乞丐，對於這些人的賑救，最好除了平常的施衣施粥之外，由各相當的慈善團體和當局合作，舉辦處理赤貧者的專門機關，其有鄉可歸者，助其離滬返鄉；其老弱殘廢者，始酌量分派至各適富的慈善團體，給以必要的醫療，衣食，並酌量授以技術訓練，使不存依賴性而有作工之機會。對於一般無家無鄉可歸的少壯男女，則不能依普通辦法加以救濟，需要用强迫方法，使入一定的習藝所或訓練所，授以必要的技術，加以嚴格的訓練，使在最短期內，成爲生產份子。</p>
<p>其次，所謂「隱貧」階層，是指一般現有職業的低級薪水（包括敎職員等在內）而言。這種人在今日上海市民中佔有絕大多數，上海的眞正繁榮和中日的切實協力，都希望這輩人的覺悟與自動的努力。可是，這輩人大都收入絕少，而有着家庭的拖累，以致陷於求生艱難的苦境。從消極意義的救濟說，自然竭上海所有慈善團體之全力未必會救助其萬一；可是，從積極的救助說，則對於這種隱貧階層的救助，是比對赤貧者的救助，具有更重大也更迫切的意義。因此今年的冬賑，必須把賑濟隱貧作爲對象之一，籌擬出妥善的辦法，由當局，各慈善團體和各行業各機關主持人密切合作之下，努力實施，那才說得上「功德無量」，對於上海社曾經濟和政治的前途，也會發生不可估量的貢獻。</p>
<p>第四，關於冬賑的經費，（一）來源方面，主要是動員各界領袖在統一的方針和辦法之下進行勸募，尤其是以市民自願捐輸爲主要原則，其次，我們更盼望工部局方面在遊藝稅項中撥出一筆款子來，充作今年冬賑之用。（二）動用方法，必須依照統一的方針與辦法，酌量實際情形，分別緩急輕重，戒愼從事，以期無分文浪費。而且一切帳目，都要隨時公開發表。</p>
<p>最後，我們不厭重複地指出，目前上海的繫華富裕只是表面現象，廣大的中下階層市民已頻於極困難的境域，這是本市經濟上社會上和政治上的莫大隱憂。我們在這裏大聲疾呼，希望一輩處在領導地位的認淸這種危機，趕快與當局協力，積極展開救濟工作，首先是冬賑工作。我們希望當局和各界領袖在今年的冬賑中，表現出些成績來，以慰大衆的喁望。</p>

<h3>從南太平洋海戰談到明日之決戰　參加對談者大本營海軍報道部課長平出大佐</h3>
<p>— 東日編輯主幹阿部賢一</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>譯自十二月十三日「星期每日」</p>
<p>平出　甚是：我也有同感。到現在爲止，美國的上級指揮官在學習些什麽，雖然不淸楚，但是我可以說：他們是有很多缺點的。特別是這次戰爭中，空襲警報發生之後，這些警報却不能在適當的期間，到達指揮官之手。譬如夏威夷方面，據敵方的查問會審問的結果，十二月八日，我大編成隊蕩蕩向眞珠灣襲擊，他們在三十分鐘前就看到了。但是，情報沒有按時到達指揮官之手。還有，眞珠灣口我潛艇的活動，被敵人的巡洋艦看見，從而受到射擊，這是空襲前差不多一小時的事。但是，這也沒有向指揮官處通報。本年八月八日，就在發生次拉基夜戰的那天，展九時半和十時，敵飛行隊兩次發見了我方凖備夜襲的部隊，並加以偵察。後來却也毫無適當的處置。當時能有些微警覺，那天午後我夜襲部隊不成問題地要受到敵人的空襲了。</p>
<p>阿部　美國自去年一月起，霍爾長官就促海軍對日本作防禦準備，但是這命令是沒有什麽實效的。這，我認爲是美國人的媽虎。他們平時的訓練壞極了。訓練不是專靠命令就能成功的。這非有十年二十年長期間的磨鍊不可。所羅門海戰的詳情雖然不淸楚，最近讀了丹羽文雄君的海戰，據說當時我方飛機飛過去，敵人的哨戒機光是呆看着，不發一彈。直到這邊打了過去，他們才慌慌張張加以回擊。然而，這實在是不能想像的。</p>
<p>平出　我想，這是有一層理由的。夜戰這樣的事，敵人差不多從未考慮過，因此也就從未有過什麽訓練。晚上一切都休止了，還打什麽仗呢？美國的老爺兵大概是這樣想的。英美的海軍武官，有很多曾長期在日本逗留過，我國海軍怎樣地受着訓練，學着怎樣的戰法，也許他們都曾硏究過。這是他們的工作。所以日本海軍有着夜戰訓練的事，他們也不應該不知道。然而結果還是毫無對付辦法，這眞是慘極慘極。他們大概在想：不管日本有怎樣的訓練，蕞爾小國恐怕總不會有什麼實際的成就。他們一直是這樣地目空一切，更不像話的是，他們戰敗之後，還不覺悟。還要自欺欺人地想：這次的戰敗，完全失之於疏忽，失之於認議不足。此後應再加訓練，到一九四四年再見顏色……</p>
<p>防空的要諦—思想戰</p>
<p>阿部　他們想得眞好啊：</p>
<p>平出　世界獨一的念頭，他們在睡夢中也在想着的。艦隊是世界第一……什麽都是世界第一。</p>
<p>阿部　但是，以四三及四四年爲目標的話，在這期間，他們總要想法子來報復的吧？四月十八日的空襲是第一聲，以後那樣的事恐怕還要加多。我們無論在心理上，在設備上，都勢非築成一鐵壁的防空陣，以資抵禦不可，我以爲。你的意見怎樣？</p>
<p>平出　我覺得，關於防空一點，頂要緊的是得造成一種思想戰的空氣。尤其在家破人亡，貯藏食品的地方都被炸光之時，這思想戰的意義，是十分明顯的。那時，國民就可能厭戰，希望戰爭早日結束，和平早日恢復，等等。而我們的任務就在鼓舞民氣，叫他們即使悲痛，也得節止悲痛，永遠爲國家奉公。</p>
<p>阿部　的確是這樣的。尤其在對美作戰的塲合，美國是生產力强大的國家，我們怎麼敵得過呢，一般人都愛這樣想。但是我們得知道，有十倍　十倍二十倍的戰鬥力之謂。思想戰的意義，也就是東條首相說的，國民必須抱必勝的信念，以寡敵衆，以貧勝富。數字不足信。信賴的永遠是我們大和民族內心的力量。</p>
<h3>貝當覆電希特勒　申述法政府願望　盼對德恢復互信關係　從而樹立榮譽的諒解</h3>
<p>維希十三日哈瓦斯社電　德元首希特勒、曾於本年十一月二十七日致電貝當元首、謂德軍將佔據法國海軍根據地都隆港、並要求法國軍隊復員、貝當元首旋於本月五日復電有所說明、原電頃由賴伐爾首長向各報訪員宣布如下、「元首閣下、法國慘遭不幸、但對於其陸·海·空軍、仍保持深切之聯繫、此乃數世紀來法國忠於軍事傳統精神之表現、閣下在停戰條約中、允許法國保留一部份軍隊、證明閣下深知此項情緒之價値及德國人民之度量寬宏、此次英、美聯軍侵略北非、法國一部份領袖叛變稱逆、使閣下不得不採取各項措置、如佔據吾邊境及地中海沿岸、以及使吾陸軍復員等、以策安全、余對於此項震駭全國之決定、唯有服從而已、閣下相信任何國家苟無富於紀律及服從上官之軍隊、即無復存在之價値、旨哉斯言、余過去所由以重建足以保障法國及其殖民地之軍隊爲職志者、亦即在此、前年余拒絕離開法國本部領土、並要求停戰者、亦無非欲使法國免受更大之禍患而已、余相信貴我兩國間成立榮譽的諒解、其事非不可能、此項政策、可使法國之利益與歐洲其他各民族之利益、同時獲得解決、惟此事須在享有行動自由的政府權力下爲之、始有效果可言、此項自由權、閣下於本年十一月十日告法國人民書中、已親自保證之矣、余毅然擴大政府首長賴伐爾之權力、足以表示余對於貴我兩國恢復互信關係從而樹立諒解政策一層、期望甚殷、余深信閣下之妥協精神、有裨於此項政策之實施、披誠佈達、無任企翹、貝當叩、</p>
<p>賴伐爾對報界　宣布外交政策</p>
<p>維希十四日同盟社電　法政府首長賴伐爾、昨向報界宣布外交政策、略謂、法國必須確定其對德政策、法國一誤再誤、現正償付極大之代價時至此際、仍有一部份人傾向協約國方面、殊堪痛心、實則德國勝利始於法國有益、唯有法·德保持密切關係、始能保障歐洲避免赤化、政府當局現已拘捕一千餘人、前總理赫禮歐亦在其中、</p>

<h3>印局近影</h3>
<p>—內地轉來新德里消息—</p>
<p>印度人民的暴動、截至今天（八月二十四日）依然是一波未平一波又起地繼續着、動亂的中心、由城市移到鄉村、火車時常不通、信件遲誤、因爲鐵路有時被拆毀一段、也許小車站被搗毀了、</p>
<p>十月二日是甘地七十四歲的誕辰、在此日的前一個星期、印度將舉行「織布週」、宣傳自織土布、以爲紀念、</p>
<p>新德里正鬧房荒、因機關來的多、政府又徵用、郊外住的歐洲人却向城內搬、房子因此頓感不敷、</p>
<p>新德里又多了幾個重慶政權的新機關與團體、「中央通訊社印度分社」、「運輸處」、均已正式成立、「中國銀行」也由郊外搬到城內、「國民外交協會」及「時與潮社」辦事處均在籌備中、</p>
<p>新德里三家中國飯店、生意極爲興隆、因爲英美兵都歡喜吃中國菜、加爾各答中國人很多眞正的商人固然不少、利用名義來作買賣的也頗不乏人、加埠的海關、有一次查出渝方某要人帶了多量黃金、於是對於中國旅客都嚴加檢查、予以特別不好的待遇、</p>
<p>新德里原是寂靜的古城、現下成了軍事重鎭、記者執筆的時候、天空機聲軋軋、天兵下降原來是在訓練降落傘部隊、</p>

<h3>華僑生在內地之遭遇　矯枉過正拒絕復學　千里跋涉徬徨歧途</h3>
<p>中日事變爆發以後，重慶政權為貫徹具「抗戰」政策，在各方御竭力從事鼓吹宣傳，企圖增强最後之掙扎力，尤其在經濟上，一方面施行所謂「經濟作戰」，一方面在南洋各地華僑社會，再四捐索吸收外匯，三四年間，華僑大衆，惑於宣傳，輸將之數，確實可觀。</p>
<p>去年大東亞戰爭之勃發，南洋一帶，先後被日軍佔領。重慶之宣傳力量，旋即消滅，但若干華僑靑年子弟，深受過去之誘惑，誤信重慶敎育部歷來發表之種種安頓僑生辦法，不辭千里風霜，遠途跋涉，奔回內地，希望復學，但所得結果，以「證件不足」而被擯於校門外者，所在多有，最近有兩位同學自內地來信，雖地域　異，而遭遇之事實則相同。</p>
<p>其一，貴州都勻之同學來信，其大意謂……在國外時，不論傳聞與報章紀載，內地敎育機關爲免使僑生輟學，訂有安頓僑生辦法，僑務機關爲優待僑生旅行，訂有旅途照料等辦法，僑生莫不欣慰歡騰，故歷盡艱苦，馳回祖國。豈知到達目的地後，竟以「證件不足」之理由，拒人於千里之於，徬徨歧途，進退維谷。此時追悔往日惑於宣傳之錯誤，已不及矣。粤南海康之老同學來信，亦以同樣情形，被迫回鄉。我輩靑年，大抵離別家庭，匆促登程，不及携帶證明文件，且有冒險衝出重圍者，即有證件，亦不及携帶。因此，對我輩復學問題，應有特別通融，不可拘泥於規章或證件，而失去進修之機會。</p>
<p>其二，廣西八步同學來信，亦謂……自香港失陷後，校長避不見面，經數月之訪問，亦無消息，遂不待證件，冒險回國，沿途受日軍盤問搜查，細節無遺，如身携證件，必被發現萬難通過。當時衷心歡慰，熱淚盈眶。迨至梧州，赴該地救僑會，會內職員態度，實太令人痛心。若輩之氣勢，竟若僑胞之救命恩人，擺起「了不得」之官架子，使人難受。當初次登記時，開口即索證件，雖經懇切說明原委，却充耳不聞，絕不諒解僑生之困難。所謂「下情不能上達，上德不能下貫」，原是一般通病。况上德之「德」，爲口惠不實之物乎？救僑機關之職員，應似醫院之看護，給予病人以最大之安慰，而减輕其痛苦：決不能以審問嫌疑犯之態度，對付千里歸來之僑生，重創我輩之心靈。</p>

<h3>糧食問題論壇</h3>
<p>本報鑒於上海糧食問題之嚴重，曾兩度爲文申論，並盼各界發表意見，期得具體合理之結論，貢獻當局採擇，頃由上海特別市商會主席袁履登先生首先賜交意見書一份，凡所建議，均爲適時適地，針對現實之對策。爰即專闢本壇發表，仍盼各界提出具體建議，彼此切磋，幸甚幸甚。</p>
<p>關於米配給之意見</p>
<p>衣食住行爲人民生活上之四大要素，尤以食爲不可一日或缺，所謂「民以食爲天」自太平洋戰爭突起，經年以來，船隻减少，運輸感到困難，米價因之逐漸上漲，洋米來源缺乏，當局對於食糧如米麵等實施統制，計口授糧，自七月六日起至十二月十日止，已配給十九期，自第一期起至第十一期止，每一星期爲一期，第十二期起至第十九期止，每十日爲一期，各期之數量，平均爲米一升半，（白米或碎米）麵粉一斤半，當初每一星期的數量，市民已感不敷，大約中等食量，足供四日之餐，其餘三日尚無着落，及至改爲十日一期時，不敷更甚，於是不得不仰給於黑市以求一飽，但除中等以上的市民極少數微有積存者外，大多數的升斗市民，遂大感困難，以前每星期配給一次，黑市米之需要尚不甚殷，是以配給官價爲每斗國幣二十五元，黑市亦僅四十元左右而已，及至各地豐收，新穀登塲之秋，論理米價本可日漸低落，而事實上適得其反，近且增至每斗一百元左右，眞是古今中外所未曾有之高價，其故由於各戶積存之米糧已罄，配給期復延長爲十日，每期碎米多而白米少，雖得添購麵粉斤半，但以數量有限，不足以補所缺，於是食糧之需要驟殷，而黑市之米價遂有增無已，亟應設法改善，以謀民生之安定，爰分述配給之具體意見如下。</p>
<p>甲，移動限制利弊</p>
<p>物資之統制，固爲戰時應有之現象，尤以食糧更宜加以統制，第統制辦法，實有商榷之必要，如每期配給之數量，須適合中人之食糧，使各戶口糧不必再仰給於黑市，黑市自然消滅，負販之徒更無從居奇，一般市民對於糧食恐慌，及米價高漲之負擔，自可予以蘇息。現在因計口授糧之數量不足，米質太劣，市民自不得不求諸負販者之手，而當局之米糧移動限制，本有每人不得超過貳斗之煌煌布告，但是一般負販之鄉民，欲由警戒綫進入租界，××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××困難重重，××××××××遂視粒米爲生命所易來，重於珍珠，蓋沿途困難愈多，租界中心區之米價愈漲，勢使然也。</p>
<p>查江浙皖本年差幸大都豐收，就一般常識言，新轂登塲，米價例應回小，故京滬杭兩路沿綫各縣，新米每石，大抵在二百廿元至二百五十元之間，若非當局嚴格限制米之入境，何至租界米價每斗貴至一百元左右，較之鄰近各縣之米價，每石相差達七八百元之鉅，此種惡性之畸形，誠屬曠古未有之奇。夫租界當局之對於米糧移動限制，在防止少數人之囤積居奇，警戒綫之限制米糧入境，而其結果，造成上述現象，不特大多數之市民，生活上感受莫大之痛苦，直接刺激其他一般物價及人力代價之激增，間接亦便物價統制政策遭遇執行上之阻礙，幷且同時還影饗到上海以外之米價與物價，我國春秋時代管子有言，漢代　錯有言：「衣食不足，民鮮廉恥」，「倉廩實，而後知禮節，衣食足，而後知榮辱」。由今之道，無變今之俗，必然會由經濟之危機，進展到政治之危機，蓋「民爲邦本，本固邦寗」深盼當局在「使民足食」之前題下，迅謀治標之解決辦法，不唯消極的任何移動限制，及米之流入禁止應予撤銷，還望積極的大量招商購運，以解市民倒懸之痛苦。</p>
<p>再則撤銷任何移動限制及米之流入禁止，似尚偏於消極方面，其積極的尤在於一般和平區域關於任何米之出境及移動，亦應一切撤銷，恢復其自由營業，而限制其操縱與囤積，同時力矯任何方面之壓迫與勒索，蓋假如蘇州米價每石爲二百五十元，運銷上海，除應完納正稅及一切正當運費外，例如爲二百八十元，上海售價，至多每石售三百元，亦已利率優厚矣，乃實際則售至九百元之鉅，××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××遂使消費者，負額外之損害，固人人所引爲疾首而痛心者已。</p>
<p>乙，米票制之意見</p>
<p>自本年七月份起，兩租界當局實行米糧配給後，軋米之風始戢，苟配給數量予以增加，則一切問題均可解決，今以配給數量旣不敷用，米票制尚談不到，但若易以米票制，計口日給適量之米票，如在家中膳食，則此米票即由家中憑票向米店購領，若在團體中或宴會塲所聚餐，則餐者各出米票一紙，俾供膳者憑票向米店購領，如是不致重複，統計亦可較爲準確，所困難者，滬埠　　雜處，輪軌輻輳，每日來往　客商，數以萬計，如京滬裏到滬時，各站旅客之來滬者以三千計，此三千旅客中，各埠是否均已實行計口授糧，各人　畔是否携有米票，即有之，　埠之米票，滬上飯店收得後，是否即在滬埠向米店購領，或米店積存成數後，向各埠交換滙直，此誠一問題，是以苟非全國一致計口授糧，數量價格又復相同，米票制之實施，亦未易言也。</p>
<p>綜合以上結論，我人　切　求當局考慮施行以下數點：</p>
<p>（一）增加每人之配給量，並改善其質地使每一市民不致半　的挨餓。</p>
<p>（二）澈底的准許小販負米入境販賣，但限制其適當之售價。</p>
<p>（三）內地開放，由當局招商運米來滬，源源接濟。</p>
<p>總之我人認爲上海之糧食問題，是關係全市民切膚之痛之嚴重問題，直接間接與上海及和平區域之政治經濟治安，均有密切重大之影響，期望當局劍及履及，迅速起而籌謀澈底之補救，與根本之解決。</p>

<h3>衛生運動的意義</h3>
<p>— 陳公博</p>
<p>今天是本市舉行冬季衛生運動的日子，衛生運動的重要性，一般人雖然有點明白，可是多半未能深切的瞭解。淺見的人們，每每以爲衛生就是淸潔，淸潔祗要做到表面的乾凈，那裏知道衛生問題，關係民族健康，可以影響到國家的盛衰興亡呢！</p>
<p>要知國民是搆成國家的要素，如果全體國民，都是身心健康的，則一切政治建設都能得到健全的發展，不難致國家於富强之域。返觀我國的情形，雖然擁有四萬萬龐大數目的人口，如果用科學的標準來舉行健康檢查，在淘汰之列的恐怕不在少數吧？</p>
<p>這話並非故意要作危言聳聽，實在是有事實的根據。例如我國人口的死亡率比文明各國多一倍，每年要白白的多犧牲六百萬人口。而待病延年不能生產，需要救濟的國民，雖無精確的統計，其數字定不在少。這些不良的情形，都是國家的弱點，要把這些弱點一一矯正過來，國家和民族才能有救。</p>
<p>雖然救國的工作，不止衛生一端，要以衛生爲首要：因爲健康是事業之母，沒有健康的國民做基礎，一切都是空言。我們現在需要和平救國，如果徒托空言，仍然於事無補。希望在這一次舉行冬季衛生運動大會以後，每個人都知道衛生的重要，在個人方面，對於衣食住行都要合於衛生；對於公共衛生方面，大家起來共同維持，共同整理；市政府爲了促起市民注意衛生，實行衛生，所以很注意衛生敎育之普及，先以南市區爲衛生敎育實騐區，將來各區也要一律推行衛生敎育。今天舉行衛生運動，也就是推行衛生敎育之一種方法，希望全市市民大家研究衛生，實行衛生，這才是救國的基本工作，和平救國才能成功，進而担負起建設大東亞的責任，完成我們的偉大使命！</p>
<h3>預防天花　必須種痘</h3>
<p>原因：天花（即痘瘡）爲感染一種天然痘毒而起，春冬二季最易流行，一經發現，凡與患者周圍接近之人，極易有接觸傳染之可能。</p>
<p>主徵：感染後經過十日至十四日之潛伏期，即有惡寒發熱，頭痛，嘔吐，四肢疼痛，譫語昏睡，咳嗽氣促，眼咽發炎等前驅症，不久即於顏面，軀幹，四肢普遍發痘瘡，同時心腦神經等重要器官，受痘毒之波及，往往發生危險之合併症，而致死亡！</p>
<p>預防及處置：預防特效方法，惟有迅速種痘！使體內增加抗毒之力量，以免受害；倘不幸發生，尤應速送傳染隔離病院診治，以免蔓延全家或鄰居之危險。値茲冬季天花容易流行時期，希望民衆密切注意，幸毋忽視種痘爲要！</p>
<h3>聖人治未病</h3>
<p>— 趙尊获</p>
<h3>衛生運動之目的</h3>
<p>— 梅</p>
<p>衛生運動的目的，是在普及衛生敎育，促進公共衛生，這是强國强民的基本工作。但是衛生的涵義，非常廣泛，事業的部門，又非常繁複，絕非單靠了政府提倡衛生運動，就算盡了公共衛生的能事。只能說推行公共衛生，要從衛生運動入手，公共衛生包括各種科學，然而我們的民衆，除一般專家以外，不要說對於公共衛生沒有研究，就是對於普通的衛生常識，恐怕也沒有充分的瞭解。要使民衆能瞭解普通的衛生常識，那全靠衛生敎育的推行，而舉行衛生運動亦就是推進衛生敎育方法的一種。因爲衛生運動，是用種種的宣傳方法，來使民衆認識衛生的重要。譬如大掃除，可使知汚穢有礙健康；慎飮食，可使知少生疾病；預防注射，可抵抗疫病之傳染；撲滅蚊蠅，可减少疫病之蔓延等等；一切衛生常識，使民衆能從認識而達於注意，從注意而能實行。由少數民衆漸漸推及多數而求其普遍，這樣，衛生運動才能算有價値，衛生敎育纔能有成績，提倡公共衛生的目的才能達成。因爲民衆普遍受到了衛生敎育，即能瞭解公共衛生的重要，而所有一切衛生事業，無不易於推行，一經推行無阻，即可以從提高個人的健康水準，以至延長人類的壽命，可以從個人的健康，以至增進全民族的强壯；同時即可增加人民生產的能力，减除經濟無形的鉅大消耗，而國家的强盛，亦就可期了。所以說衛生運動是强國强民的發軔，自無不當。</p>
<h3>愼防煤氣中毒</h3>
<p>原因</p>
<p>煤炭在燃燒的時候，發生一種無臭，無味，而極有毒的氣體（化學名稱一氧化炭），在燃燒未旺時，發生更多，室內空氣中有百分之〇·五以上的一氧氣化炭，就可致人性命，冬天生火取暖，若不預防，就有中煤毒的慘變。</p>
<p>預防</p>
<p>（一）燒煤炭時，應在通風空曠之處燒旺，然後拿到房裏。</p>
<p>（二）如其是不便移動的火爐，在燒煤炭的時候，應把窗門敞開。</p>
<p>（三）房內燒着煤爐或火爐的時候，應把窗或門酌量開開，至少每小時將窗戶開三五分鐘，以便交換空氣。</p>
<p>（四）爐上應置水壺或水盆。</p>
<p>（五）睡後房內不要再燃火爐。</p>
<p>急救</p>
<p>倘然不幸，已經中了煤炭毒，快把窗戶敞開，立刻把病人移到空氣充暢的地方，一面快請醫生診治，如病人呼吸困難，或氣息微薄，速行人工呼吸。</p>
<h3>愼防白喉</h3>
<p>原因</p>
<p>由於白喉桿菌的侵入。例如和病人同食同睡同坐或對面談話，或合用碗筷等都能傳染，尤喜侵犯十歲以下之兒童。</p>
<p>主徵</p>
<p>該菌侵入後，二天至七天後，在喉頭或鼻腔等處生膜，呑嚥困難，頸腺腫痛，呼吸阻碍，發聲沙啞，如不速即就醫診治，即因血中毒而死。</p>
<p>預防</p>
<p>勿和病人接近，或共用器物以免傳染，無病之兒童可先舉行錫克氏試騐，如不幸傳染白喉速即就醫。</p>
<h3>吾人對於衛生運動應有之認識</h3>
<p>— 世良</p>
<p>在三十年前，「衛生」二字，除了少數具有新智識的人還能瞭解而外，一般民衆却不知衛生是什麽？近年以來，「衛生」二字雖然已經盡人皆知，然而什麼是衛生的意義？衛生的重要如何？恐怕一般人還未能深切的認識吧！</p>
<p>舉行衛生運動，是喚起一般民衆注意衛生，也可以說：是推行衛生敎育的一種具體表現。這種運動，國際間　很少見。吾國因爲一般民衆敎育水準低落，所以要由政府來提倡衛生運動，促使民衆注意衛生。</p>
<p>公共衛生的完成，要以個人衛生做基礎。因爲個人衛生的條件，比較容易做到，凡是受過敎育的人，對於衛生常識總能瞭解一些，最低限度的個人衛生，便能保持。然單靠着很狹義的個人衛生，而忽略了家庭衛生和社會衛生，還是不澈底的，如果遭遇到傳染病的流行，仍舊免不了有傳染的危險。尤其是那些祇重私德而不顧公德的人，自己身上講究淸潔，而家庭裏可以不管，或者家裏講究淸潔，而公衆衛生不去顧到，把自己家裏的垃圾，汚泥，糞水，汚水，倒在道路上，妨礙公共衛生，這種舉動，實在太幼稚，結果還是妨礙了自己。因爲傳染病的發生，都是由這許多廢物裏發生出來的，尤其是在夏天，這許多垃圾裏所包含的細菌，經過太陽的蒸發，或是蚊蠅的媒介，傳染病自然容易發生了。例如霍亂病一經發生蔓延起來，非常的快，一個人生了病，立刻就能傳染到衆人鄰舍，甚至一鎭一縣，一省一國，亦有可能。推究原因，全由人民缺乏衛生常識，所以政府要提倡衛生運動，使全國民衆都注意衛生的重要。</p>
<p>衛生運動的目的是减少疾病，使國民個個皆有健全的體魄，增長壽命，去做富國强民的偉大事業。吾們要達到這個目的，必須人人負起改造環境衛生的責任，淸潔道路垃圾，出淸家庭汚物，淸潔厠所廚房，撲滅蚊蠅等，這是改良環境衛生中的最主要工作，不過這種工作，決不是舉行了一次衛生運動就成功了，衛生運動，不過是借着這一天喚起一般民衆把「衛生」二字有個切實的瞭解，而要促進每個人要養成衛生的習慣，可以保障大衆的生命安全，同時减少疾病率和死亡率。不過衛生工作不是人民片面的事情，也不是單靠着政府的力量所能做到，必須要互相合作，才能達到人民健康，社會幸福，國家强盛的地步。</p>
<h3>為本市第一屆冬季衛生運動告市民書</h3>
<p>— 袁矩範</p>
<p>市民們：</p>
<p>現在冬季衛生運動又開幕了，提起衛生問題。凡是有識的市民，沒有不認爲重要的。可是一般人往往有點誤解，以爲夏令時疫流行，應該注重衛生，至於氣候轉凉，漸漸由秋而冬，時疫消滅，生命的威脅已經解　，可以高枕無憂了。</p>
<p>其實衛生問題，無論什麽時候都不能疏忽，雖然於幾種病菌在夏令易於繁殖，可以殺人於俄頃之間，但也有些病菌，不畏嚴寒，在冬季裏依然爲我們生命的威脅，如天花，傷寒，赤痢，流行性感冒，上氣道炎等病，在冬季也可流行，希望大家注意預防。</p>
<p>衛生的方法，應以淸潔爲首要，身體環境整潔，病菌就無從寄生繁殖。如果我們沒有養成愛淸潔的習慣，衣服不常換，頭髮不常理，也不常洗澡，就很易寄生蚤蝨，而傳染鼠疫，斑疹傷寒，同歸熱，戰壕熱等病。又如隨地吐痰和便溺，或是亂倒垃圾，不但有損市容，自甘暴露不衛生的惡習，貽民族國家之羞，而且傳播肺癆，傷寒，赤痢等病菌，危害民族健康，影響國民經濟。</p>
<p>希望市民們認淸衛生的意義和價値，自己檢討一下，對於個人衛生方面，應有的衛生習慣都養成了嗎？家庭衛生　經加以改良了嗎？公共衛生的規律都遵守了嗎？如果每個人都能注意這些問題而去實行，個人才能健康，家庭才能幸福，國家才能强盛。</p>
<p>所以我們在這舉行衛生運動的時候，請諸位對於衛生問題加以注意，把已往一切不合衛生的積習，加以澈底洗滌，重新確立健康快樂的人生觀，才能達到我們預期的目的，完成强國强種的偉大使命，這是本會熱忱盼望諸位市民的！</p>
<h3>冬季衛生運動大會感言</h3>
<p>— 袁厚之</p>
<p>本市十二月十五日舉行第一屆冬季衛生運動大會，此實爲當務之急。蓋德智體三育雖稱並重而體實爲之主。假使體格衰弱，或甚至死亡不存，雖有德有智，亦將何所用之。德若顏淵而竟短命，又若再伯牛而身染惡疾，德雖在身而未及施於人也，亦何貴乎有此。於智亦然，賈體王佐之才，而壽僅三十三；李賀詩歌絕代，而年僅二十七。皆以年齡不永，而未竟其用也。然若美人愛迪生壽至八十五，而其重要發明電燈，至今全球人類咸被其澤者，則多爲四十九歲以後之事。又若德人倫琴壽七十九，而其發明愛克司光，則已在五十一歲。向使此二人者享年亦僅如賈誼李賀，安得而有此？皮之不存，毛將安傳？此自然之理也。雖人之修短有命，然善養生者攝生有道，亦未嘗不可以人定勝天。嵇叔夜所謂「爲稼於湯之世，偏有一溉之功者，雖終歸於焦爛，必一溉者後枯也。「我國人士所患最常尋而普　者莫若肺癆，幾於十人其九。據上海租界工部局衛生處每週報告人民死亡率，其由肺癆而死亡者，常佔百分之七十以上。然　非不可預防也。歐美文化科學最稱昌明之國，其肺癆死亡率有减低至不及百分之十者。他若霍亂，傷寒，紅痧，白喉，赤白痢等，皆由飲食失調，細菌作祟，重者喪生，輕者大病。向使稍知衛生之理，不食蠅污之食，不飲不潔之水，又衣服起居，各適其宜，何至於有此？雖曰疾病之來，自有醫藥可以救治。然醫藥者治之於已然也　與其治之於已然，毋奪防之於未然。至於未雨綢繆，防範疾病於隱微者，即衛生尚已　焦頭爛額者醫藥也，曲突徙薪者衛生也。醫藥者末也，衛生者本也。假使衛生得法，人人又能知而實行，則疾病何由發生，自必咸臻康健，同登壽域，醫藥但爲輔佐之具可也。本市自推行衛生運動以來，今夏霍亂，其初雖甚猖獗，而以救治得法，預防盡善，標本兼施，內外並治，不久即告撲滅，不爲大患。他如防癆之法，亦經設施，無微不至，今又將禁止隨地吐痰，尤爲扼要之着。至於冬季衛生；自以廣種牛痘，預防天花爲第一急務。夫强國必先强種，世上豈有不講衛生，疲癃疾病之民族，而猶可以强大其國者哉！此後德智二育，自亦同等推行運動，如此三育並茂，不但人人體格健全，優生可致，且道德與智慧並流齊進，豈但强種而已哉！國家之强，自更可如操左券也。際茲第一屆冬季衛生運動大會發軔之時，爰誌數語，以表感想，幷爲誦杜甫詩曰」八方開壽域，一氣轉洪鈞」以當祝頌。</p>
<p>今日爲「本市第一屆冬季衛生運動大會」特刊，自由談暫停一天，明日照常發刊。</p>

<h3>Winter Relief</h3>
<p>Shanghai remains a prosperous metropolis, not only the first major city in China but also, in terms of market affluence and luxurious living, likely "second to none" in all of East Asia. However, upon closer inspection, we discover that the prosperity and wealth Shanghai retains today, five or six years into the war, is a distorted prosperity, a prosperity that violates the goals of the Greater East Asia War, a prosperity that sees a few people taking advantage of wartime conditions to profit and get rich. Behind this facade of prosperity lies a shocking decline. Poverty is rampant, with the entire middle and lower classes struggling for survival. We must recognize that, of Shanghai's four million-plus population, the middle and lower classes forced into "hidden poverty" and "absolute poverty" today constitute the absolute majority; and these citizens are precisely the fundamental force cooperating in the Greater East Asia War. To allow these citizens to decline and become impoverished, leaving only a few nouveau riche and magnates, while still chanting about cooperation in the Greater East Asia War, is simply unimaginable. Therefore, saving the fate of Shanghai's vast middle and lower classes, rescuing the "hidden poor" and "absolute poor" masses, is an important task for the current authorities and leaders of all sectors of society, and winter relief is a major part of this task.</p>
<p>Winter relief is not a novel movement; it has almost been regarded as an "annual routine." In the past, those who carried out this work would only perform a superficial winter relief effort when winter arrived. Even those who sincerely devoted themselves to the effort ultimately faced limitations due to limited manpower and resources and focused only on passive relief, naturally limiting the results. Now, in the extraordinary period of the Greater East Asia War, this year's winter relief has a different meaning from past winter relief efforts. This year's winter relief must have a positive significance, that is to say, it must aim to save the fate of the hidden poor and absolutely poor classes teetering on the brink, to gather the strength of Shanghai's general middle and lower classes, and to further become a great force assisting the authorities in promoting everything beneficial to a new Shanghai and helpful to the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>In this year's winter relief with its novel significance, we must have methods that adapt to this significance: First, we sincerely hope that the authorities recognize the special needs and significance of this year's winter relief, address the actual situation of Shanghai society, especially gain insight into the actual situation of the vast number of hidden poor and absolutely poor classes, listen to the opinions of leaders from all sectors and experts, and quickly formulate the basic guidelines and implementation outline for this year's winter relief, in order to promote a planned, organized, and step-by-step winter relief movement. The authorities should also stand in a supporting position during the implementation of winter relief and should not relax their supervisory responsibilities at any time, so that this year's winter relief can achieve fruitful results through unified implementation.</p>
<p>Second, the implementers of winter relief work are naturally not the authorities but the existing charitable organizations and leaders from all sectors of society. However, in view of the lack of close contact and mutually coordinated plans among various groups in past winter relief work, which inevitably led to phenomena of favoring the easy over the difficult and attending to one thing while neglecting another, it was difficult to expect satisfactory results. This year's winter relief must be earnestly implemented under the authorities' established winter relief movement guidelines and leadership, according to established steps. At the same time, all charitable organizations, in particular, should have a broad vision, not harbor concepts of boundaries or sectarianism, contact each other, take care of each other, and fully achieve the point of "division of labor and cooperation," so that no energy or financial resources are wasted and all can achieve considerable results. At the same time, those receiving relief, the hidden poor and the absolutely poor, will universally receive practical benefits, without a few people receiving relief from many sources while the majority have the regret of "missing out."</p>
<p>Third, there must be a full understanding of the targets of relief. We believe that this year's winter relief, in addition to the absolutely poor, must pay particular attention to the "hidden poor." The so-called absolutely poor are vagrants or beggars with no clothes, no food, and no home to return to. For these people, in addition to the usual distribution of clothing and porridge, it is best that various relevant charitable organizations and the authorities cooperate to establish special agencies to handle the absolutely poor. Those who have a hometown to return to should be helped to leave Shanghai and return home; the old, weak, and disabled should be assigned to various suitable charitable organizations, given necessary medical care, food, and clothing, and provided with vocational training, so that they do not remain dependent and have the opportunity to work. For general young men and women with no home and no hometown to return to, they cannot be rescued by ordinary means and need to be forced into vocational training centers or training centers, given necessary skills, and subjected to strict training, so that they become productive members of society in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Secondly, the so-called "hidden poor" class refers to those with existing jobs who earn low salaries (including teachers, etc.). This type of person constitutes the vast majority of Shanghai citizens today, and the true prosperity of Shanghai and the genuine cooperation between China and Japan depend on the awareness and voluntary efforts of these people. However, most of these people have very little income and have the burden of a family, leading to a difficult struggle for survival. From the perspective of negative relief, even if all of Shanghai's charitable organizations exerted their full strength, they might not be able to save even a fraction of them; however, from the perspective of active relief, assisting this hidden poor class is of greater and more urgent significance than assisting the absolutely poor. Therefore, this year's winter relief must include the hidden poor as one of its targets, devise appropriate methods, and work closely with the authorities, various charitable organizations, and heads of various industries and institutions to implement them. Only then can it be said to be "immeasurable merit," and it will also make an immeasurable contribution to Shanghai's social, economic, and political future.</p>
<p>Fourth, regarding the funds for winter relief, (1) the source is mainly mobilizing leaders from all sectors to conduct fundraising under unified guidelines and methods, especially with the principle of voluntary donations from citizens as the main principle. Secondly, we also hope that the Municipal Council will allocate a sum of money from entertainment taxes for this year's winter relief. (2) The method of use must be in accordance with unified guidelines and methods, taking into account the actual situation, distinguishing between urgency and importance, and proceeding cautiously, in order to avoid wasting a single penny. Moreover, all accounts must be published publicly at any time.</p>
<p>Finally, we reiterate that Shanghai's current prosperity and wealth are only a superficial phenomenon, and the vast middle and lower-class citizens are on the verge of extreme hardship. This is a great hidden concern for the city's economy, society, and politics. We loudly call out here, hoping that those in leadership positions will recognize this crisis, quickly cooperate with the authorities, and actively launch relief work, starting with winter relief work. We hope that the authorities and leaders from all sectors will show some results in this year's winter relief to comfort the public's hopes.</p>
<h3>### Emperor of Japan Visits Ise Grand Shrine to Pray for Victory in War; Prime Minister Tojo Urges the People to Rise Up and Concentrate Efforts to Complete the Greater East Asia War</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Domei News Agency) – Yesterday afternoon, the Ministry of the Imperial Household announced that the Emperor departed on the morning of December 11th at 8:00 AM to visit Kyoto Prefecture and Mie Prefecture to worship at the Ise Grand Shrine, and returned to the palace yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM. The 100 million Japanese people, upon hearing that the Emperor personally visited the Ise Grand Shrine to pray for victory in the war, were greatly moved and encouraged. This is a historic first. Those accompanying him included Chief Aide-de-Camp Hyakutake, Grand Chamberlain Matsudaira, Lord Chamberlain Ohto, and Prime Minister Tojo.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) – A statement from the Ministry of the Imperial Household stated that His Majesty the Emperor departed on the 11th of this month to visit Kyoto Prefecture and Mie Prefecture. On the 12th, he reverently and personally conducted a solemn worship ceremony at the Ise Grand Shrine. He stayed overnight at the Kyoto Imperial Palace on the evening of the same day and returned to the palace on the 13th. Historically, the Japanese Emperor used to send imperial envoys to the Ise Grand Shrine to silently pray to the imperial ancestors during times of emergency, starting with the Mongolian invasion of Japan, followed by numerous occasions during the late shogunate period. However, His Majesty the Emperor personally visiting the Grand Shrine under the circumstances of war to pray for victory is an unprecedented event in the history of the Grand Shrine, deeply moving the 100 million people of Japan. This visit by His Majesty the Emperor has further strengthened the determination of the entire Japanese nation to persevere in the war to the end, and at the same time demonstrated to the universe Japan's national determination to strive for ultimate victory.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) – Prime Minister Tojo made a statement on the 13th regarding the Emperor's personal visit to the Ise Grand Shrine to pray for victory in the war, stating in essence that it has been a long-standing custom for the Emperor to send imperial envoys to the Grand Shrine to report and seek divine assistance when major events occur in the nation. However, it is unprecedented in history for His Majesty the Emperor to visit the Grand Shrine during the midst of war and personally worship before the imperial ancestor deity. This visit by the Emperor is to report the unprecedented great war achievements of our country in the land, sea, and air in the year since the start of the war. During this critical autumn of the war situation, His Majesty personally leads the people to seek the protection of the ancestral spirits, which is truly a profound consideration. I was honored to be ordered to accompany the visit and witness the glorious ceremony of worshipping at the Grand Shrine. In my fear and gratitude, I resolve to dedicate myself completely and exhaust my loyalty to ease the imperial mind. Today, the Greater East Asia War has entered its second year. The Emperor's personal visit to the Grand Shrine makes us 100 million citizens even more aware of the gravity of the current situation. We must rise up with inspiration and courage. All 100 million citizens must be of one heart and one mind, concentrate the total power of the nation, and complete the Greater East Asia War to repay the imperial grace even in the slightest.</p>

<h3>Talking about Tomorrow's Decisive Battle from the South Pacific Naval Battle – Participants: Colonel Hiraide, Chief of the Naval Press Department of the Imperial Headquarters</h3>
<p>— Abe Kenichi, Chief Editor of the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Translated from the December 13th issue of "Weekly Mainichi"</p>
<p>Hiraide: Indeed, I feel the same way. While it's unclear what the American senior commanders have been learning up to now, I can say that they have many shortcomings. Especially in this war, after air raid alarms are issued, these alarms fail to reach the commanders in a timely manner. For example, in Hawaii, according to the results of the enemy's inquiry and interrogation, our large formation was seen heading towards Pearl Harbor 30 minutes before the attack on December 8th. However, the information did not reach the commander in time. Also, the activities of our submarines in Pearl Harbor were spotted by enemy cruisers and came under fire, which was about an hour before the air raid. However, this was not reported to the commander. On August 8th of this year, on the very day of the Battle of Savo Island, enemy aircraft twice discovered and reconnoitered our forces preparing for a night attack at 9:30 PM and 10:00 PM. However, no appropriate action was taken afterward. If they had been slightly more alert at the time, our night attack force would have undoubtedly been subjected to an enemy air raid that afternoon.</p>
<p>Abe: Since January of last year, Commander Hall had been urging the navy to prepare defenses against Japan, but this order was ineffective. I believe this is due to the American "ma-hu" (carelessness). Their peacetime training is terrible. Training cannot be successful with commands alone. It requires a long period of ten or twenty years of honing. Although the details of the Solomon Islands naval battle are unclear, I recently read Mr. Niwa Fumio's account of the naval battle, which said that when our planes flew over, the enemy patrol planes just stared blankly, without firing a single shot. Only after we attacked did they panic and return fire. This is truly unimaginable.</p>
<p>Hiraide: I think there is a reason for this. The enemy had almost never considered night battles, and therefore had never had any training in them. Everything stops at night, so why fight? That's probably what the American old boys thought. Many British and American naval attachés had stayed in Japan for a long time. They may have studied how our navy was trained and what tactics it learned. That was their job. So they should have known that the Japanese navy had night battle training. However, the result was that they had no countermeasures, which is truly tragic. They probably thought: No matter how much training Japan has, a small country is unlikely to have any real achievements. They had always been so arrogant and dismissive. What's worse, they don't wake up after losing the battle. They still deceive themselves into thinking: This defeat was entirely due to negligence and insufficient recognition. They should train more and see us again in 1944...</p>
<p>The Essence of Air Defense - Ideological Warfare</p>
<p>Abe: They have wonderful dreams.</p>
<p>Hiraide: It's a world-unique idea. They're thinking about it even in their dreams. The fleet is the best in the world... everything is the best in the world.</p>
<p>Abe: But if they're aiming for 1943 and 1944, they'll have to find a way to retaliate during that time, right? The air raid on April 18th was the first sign, and there will probably be more of those kinds of things. We must build an iron wall of air defense, both psychologically and in terms of equipment, to defend ourselves. What's your opinion?</p>
<p>Hiraide: I think that the most important thing about air defense is to create an atmosphere of ideological warfare. Especially when families are destroyed and food storage places are bombed, the significance of this ideological warfare is very clear. At that time, the people may become tired of the war, hoping for an early end to the war and a restoration of peace, and so on. And our task is to boost morale, to tell them that even if they are grieved, they must restrain their grief and serve the country forever.</p>
<p>Abe: That's indeed the case. Especially in the war against the United States, people tend to think: How can we compete with the United States, a country with such powerful production capacity? But we must know that there is such a thing as ten times, twenty times the combat power. The significance of ideological warfare is that, as Prime Minister Tojo said, the people must have the belief in victory, to defeat the many with the few, to overcome the rich with the poor. Numbers are not to be trusted. What we trust forever is the power within our Yamato nation.</p>
<h3>Pétain Replied to Hitler, Stating the Wishes of the French Government, Hoping to Restore Mutual Trust and Establish Honorable Understanding</h3>
<p>Vichy, 13th (Havas News Agency) – German leader Hitler sent a telegram to Marshal Pétain on November 27th of this year, stating that German troops would occupy the French naval base in Toulon and requesting the demobilization of the French army. Marshal Pétain sent a reply on the 5th of this month explaining the situation. The original telegram was recently announced to reporters by Chief Laval as follows: "Your Excellency, France has suffered misfortune, but maintains a deep connection with its land, sea, and air forces. This is a manifestation of France's loyalty to the spirit of military tradition over the centuries. Your Excellency allowed France to retain a portion of its army in the armistice agreement, proving that Your Excellency is deeply aware of the value of this sentiment and the generosity of the German people. This time, the British and American Allied forces invaded North Africa, and a portion of French leaders rebelled, causing Your Excellency to take various measures, such as occupying our borders and the Mediterranean coast, and demobilizing our army, to ensure safety. I can only obey these decisions that shocked the country. Your Excellency believes that any country without an army rich in discipline and obedience to superiors has no value in existence. Wise words! It is with this in mind that I have made it my mission to rebuild an army sufficient to protect France and its colonies. Two years ago, I refused to leave the territory of mainland France and requested an armistice, solely to spare France from greater disasters. I believe that it is not impossible for an honorable understanding to be established between our two countries. This policy can simultaneously resolve the interests of France and the interests of other European nations. However, this can only be effective under the power of a government that enjoys freedom of action. Your Excellency personally guaranteed this freedom in the message to the French people on November 10th of this year. I resolutely expanded the power of the Head of Government, Laval, to express my hope for restoring mutual trust between our two countries and establishing a policy of understanding. I deeply believe that Your Excellency's spirit of compromise will be conducive to the implementation of this policy. Sincerity is conveyed. I am most expectant, Pétain."</p>
<p>Laval Announced Diplomatic Policy to the Press</p>
<p>Vichy, 14th (Domei News Agency) – The Head of the French Government, Laval, announced the diplomatic policy to the press yesterday, stating that France must determine its policy towards Germany. France has erred again and again and is now paying a great price. It is regrettable that even at this point, some people are leaning towards the Allied side. In fact, Germany's victory would be beneficial to France. Only by maintaining a close relationship between France and Germany can Europe be protected from communism. The government authorities have now arrested over a thousand people, including former Prime Minister Herriot.</p>
<p>Madrid, 13th (Central News Agency) – Observers in informed circles here believe that Head of Government Laval will meet with German leader Hitler around the 13th to exchange views on the reorganization of the French cabinet, the return of the French government to Paris, and other important issues. The general public attaches great importance to the talks between the two.</p>
<h3>Heavy Rain in Tunisia Affects Military Operations; Intense Air Battles in Cyrenaica; German Planes Bomb the Port of Benghazi</h3>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Haitong News Agency) – Although this place refuses to comment on the military news from the Cyrenaica front, informed sources are quite optimistic about the development of the battle situation. They stated that the development of the North African war situation the other day should enable the German position to become more stable. Once the details can be announced, it will prove that General Rommel can still manipulate the war, overcome the enemy and win. In Tunisia, there are only small local battles, and continuous heavy rain has greatly affected military operations.</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Haitong News Agency) – Reliable sources here claim that the temporary port facilities recently built by the British in Benghazi were bombed by German planes yesterday, causing a lot of damage. There was an air battle in the Mediterranean yesterday. The Allied side lost 12 aircraft, and one German aircraft did not return to its base.</p>
<p>Rome, 14th (Haitong News Agency) – The Italian military report this afternoon stated that in the fierce air battle in Cyrenaica yesterday, German aircraft shot down a total of nine enemy aircraft. The German side suffered no losses. Another three enemy aircraft were shot down by anti-aircraft teams. The land warfare in Cyrenaica yesterday was only skirmishes and artillery battles. In Tunisia, Axis aircraft were dispatched day and night to bomb the enemy's supply hubs, especially the port of Bone. Enemy aircraft attacked the city of Susa in Tunisia, causing heavy civilian casualties.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 14th (Domei News Agency) – US Secretary of the Army Stimson announced the North African operational goal yesterday, stating that the Allied forces must first destroy all Axis aircraft, and then attack Tripoli to wipe out General Rommel's troops, so that the Mediterranean Sea becomes a safe line of communication directly to the Near East. Observers here commented that Stimson's approach has not achieved anything and admits that Rommel's troops are the most elite and unparalleled in the world.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) – According to a Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun dispatch from Lisbon, as a result of the meeting between British Prime Minister Churchill and South African Federal Prime Minister Smuts in London, a portion of the South African Federal troops will soon enter the Tunisian front. This preparatory action has caused discontent among the people of South Africa. Therefore, knowledgeable people say that the South African Federation should reject Britain's use of South African troops abroad.</p>
<h3>Eastern Front Situation</h3>
<p>Haitong telegram from the German Supreme Headquarters, 14th: Today's German war bulletin states: In the Caucasus Mountains, enemy attacks yesterday were repelled. Fierce battles occurred in other sections of the southern front and are still ongoing. German armored vehicle units launched an attack from the southwest of Stalingrad, destroying more than 20 Soviet tanks. In the Kolmak grassland, our troops penetrated the enemy's rear, capturing many prisoners. The enemy's supply line there is threatened by our forces. Soviet attacks on the Don River front were severely repulsed by Italian forces. 25 Soviet aircraft were lost, while German aircraft lost only 4. Between Kalinin and Lake Ilmen, fighting continues. Soviet attempts to break through failed, resulting in the loss of 31 tanks. From November 25th to date, the Soviets have had a total of 1,568 tanks destroyed by German forces in that area.</p>

The troops of the Sixth War Zone of the Chongqing government have always been afraid of Japanese attacks. Whenever the Japanese forces attack, the Chongqing forces are at a loss and flee in panic. After this defeat, they fabricated false propaganda about recapturing Zifusi. (2) In the middle of the month, Japanese forces in the Yuezhou area attacked the confronting 134th Division of the Chongqing government on the Tuoba front, sweeping through 71 Chongqing military strongholds. (3) In the latter part of the month, Japanese forces in the Yingcheng area launched an annihilation campaign against the 128th Division of the Chongqing government and the New Fourth Army on the north bank of Shenhu Lake (approximately 45 kilometers south of Yingcheng) with the cooperation of land and air forces, achieving significant results. (4) The Chongqing air force launched several attacks in the latter part of the month, but after fierce attacks by Japanese aircraft and ground artillery, the Chongqing aircraft dropped bombs in panic, blindly bombing civilian houses, causing popular resentment to reach its peak. (5) From September to the end of November, the combined results of the Japanese military in the Wuhan area were as follows: 5,200 bodies of Chongqing soldiers were abandoned, and 1,800 were captured. Japanese forces intercepted 5 artillery pieces and 190 heavy and light machine guns.</p>
<p>Hankou, 14th (Central News Agency): The Japanese military authorities recently announced the results of the mopping-up operations around Wuhan, as follows: (1) On the 3rd of this month, Japanese troops in the Xiantaozhen area launched a fierce attack at dawn on the five battalions of the 178th Division of the Chongqing government near Zhangjiagou (16 kilometers west of Xiantaozhen, 7 kilometers west of the east bank of Paihu Lake), defeating them and forcing them to flee south. (2) From the 3rd to the 4th of this month, Japanese troops in the Huanghai area began to mop up the guerrillas operating in Hekouzhen, 18 kilometers west of Huang'an, and Taohuadian, 12 kilometers south of that location, and have already cleared them out. (3) On the 7th of this month, Japanese troops in the Yingshan area completely defeated the Chongqing forces near Shibaliliwan, 8 kilometers east of Wangjiadian on the Beijing-Hankou Railway. (4) On the 6th, Japanese forces in the Jingdou area discovered approximately 150 Chongqing soldiers near Lengshuipu, 35 kilometers east of Jingmen, and launched a fierce attack, causing them to collapse. (5) Japanese troops in the Shayangzhen area mopped up the Dare-to-Die Corps of the Sixth War Zone of the Chongqing government near Renjiajing, 25 kilometers south of Shayangzhen, and five officers surrendered with a large quantity of weapons and ammunition. (6) On the night of the 6th, Japanese troops on the Guangdong-Hankou Railway discovered the Chongqing army transporting supplies near Yanglousi, 1 kilometer to the east, and launched a fierce attack, defeating them and intercepting a large quantity of supplies. (7) Japanese troops in the Daye area have completed mopping-up operations near Bajiaoting, 30 kilometers west of Daye, and in the Cikouzhen area, 25 kilometers west of that location.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Implements Air Defense Training Starting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Suzhou, 14th (Central News Agency): The provincial capital has implemented air defense training starting on the 14th, for three consecutive days. A notice has been issued, with the main training items being blackout measures. In order to establish alarm transmission, air raid sirens are located at the Dafan Department Store in the city, and the Huazhong and Huatong companies and the garrison troops outside the city are used as signals. When blackout measures are in effect at night, electric lights will be turned off completely. It is understood that this is the first training session, and several more will be conducted in the future in order to improve air defense preparedness.</p>

<h3>Recent Scenes in India</h3>
<p>—News from New Delhi via the Interior—</p>
<p>The Indian people's riots, up to today (August 24th), continue to rise one after another. The center of the turmoil has shifted from the cities to the countryside. Trains are often interrupted, and letters are delayed because the railway is sometimes demolished for a section, or perhaps small stations are destroyed.</p>
<p>October 2nd is Gandhi's seventy-fourth birthday. In the week before this day, India will hold "Weaving Week" to promote self-woven homespun cloth as a commemoration.</p>
<p>New Delhi is experiencing a housing shortage, because more agencies are coming, and the government is requisitioning. Europeans living in the suburbs are moving to the city, so there is a sudden shortage of houses.</p>
<p>New Delhi has several new agencies and organizations of the Chongqing regime. The "Central News Agency Indian Branch" and the "Transportation Office" have been formally established. The "Bank of China" has also moved from the suburbs to the city. The offices of the "National Diplomacy Association" and the "Shi Yu Chao Society" are being prepared.</p>
<p>The three Chinese restaurants in New Delhi are doing very well, because British and American soldiers like to eat Chinese food. There are many Chinese in Calcutta. Although there are many genuine merchants, there are also quite a few who use the name to do business. Once, the port customs of Calcutta discovered that a certain important person from the Chongqing side was carrying a large amount of gold, so all Chinese travelers were strictly inspected and given particularly bad treatment.</p>
<p>New Delhi was originally a quiet ancient city, but now it has become a military stronghold. As the reporter writes, the sound of aircraft rumbles in the sky. Heavenly soldiers are descending, apparently training parachute troops.</p>
<p>There are not many bookstores in New Delhi, and there are even fewer important political publications.</p>

<h3>Experiences of Overseas Chinese Students in the Interior: Overcorrection Leading to Refusal of Re-enrollment; Thousands of Miles of Trekking Leaving Them Confused</h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident, the Chongqing government, in order to implement its "Resistance War" policy, spared no effort in propaganda, attempting to enhance its final struggle, especially economically. On the one hand, it implemented the so-called "economic warfare," and on the other hand, it repeatedly solicited donations and absorbed foreign exchange in overseas Chinese communities in Southeast Asia. Over three or four years, the overseas Chinese masses, deceived by propaganda, contributed truly considerable sums.</p>
<p>Last year, with the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Southeast Asian region was successively occupied by the Japanese army. The Chongqing government's propaganda power was immediately eliminated. However, some overseas Chinese youths were deeply influenced by past temptations, mistakenly believing the various arrangements for overseas Chinese students that had been announced by the Chongqing Ministry of Education over the years, and braved thousands of miles of wind and frost, trekking long distances back to the interior, hoping to re-enroll. However, the result was that many were rejected outside the school gates for "insufficient documentation." Recently, two students wrote from the interior, although the regions were different, the facts of their experiences were the same.</p>
<p>One, a student from Duyun, Guizhou, wrote, in essence, saying… When abroad, whether it was through hearsay or newspaper reports, domestic educational institutions had established arrangements for overseas Chinese students to prevent them from dropping out of school, and overseas Chinese affairs agencies had established arrangements to take care of overseas Chinese students during travel. Overseas Chinese students were all pleased and excited, so they endured hardship and rushed back to their homeland. How could they have known that after arriving at their destination, they would be rejected thousands of miles away for "insufficient documentation," left confused and at a crossroads, unable to advance or retreat. At this time, it was too late to regret the error of being deceived by propaganda in the past. An old classmate from Nanhai Kang, Guangdong, also wrote that he was forced to return home under the same circumstances. Most of us young people left our families and embarked on our journey hastily, without having time to carry supporting documents, and some even risked breaking through the encirclement. Even if we had documents, we would not have time to carry them. Therefore, there should be special consideration for our re-enrollment issue, and we should not be bound by regulations or documents, thus losing the opportunity for further study.</p>
<p>Second, a student from Babu, Guangxi, wrote, also saying… After the fall of Hong Kong, the principal avoided meeting and there was no news after months of visits, so he ventured back to the country without waiting for documents. He was questioned and searched by the Japanese army along the way, with no details spared. If he had carried documents with him, they would have been discovered and it would have been impossible to pass through. He was filled with joy and tears welled up in his eyes. Upon arriving in Wuzhou, he went to the local Overseas Chinese Relief Association. The attitude of the staff there was truly heartbreaking. Their demeanor was as if they were the saviors of the overseas Chinese, putting on an "almighty" official air, making people feel uncomfortable. When registering for the first time, they immediately demanded documents. Although he earnestly explained the reasons, they turned a deaf ear and did not understand the difficulties of the overseas Chinese students at all. The so-called "the lower situation cannot reach the higher level, and the upper virtue cannot permeate the lower level" is a common disease. Moreover, is the "virtue" of the upper level merely empty promises? The staff of the overseas Chinese relief organization should be like the nurses in a hospital, giving patients the greatest comfort and alleviating their suffering. They must not treat overseas Chinese students who have returned from thousands of miles away as suspected criminals, deeply wounding our hearts.</p>

<h3>Violation of Air Defense Control Law to be Punished as Reactionary Crimes; Full-Scale Air Defense Drill Began Yesterday</h3>
<p>The second air defense drill in the city began yesterday and will last approximately ten days. In addition to controlling lights, other important training items have been added to this drill.</p>
<p>Reason for Early Issuance of Precautionary Alarm</p>
<p>The air defense precautionary alarm was issued at 1:00 PM yesterday. The purpose of this drill is to ensure that residents cover their windows before dusk, in other words, before lighting time. However, some residents did not pay attention to the alarm at all, often failing to close window curtains or skylights, or install blackout shades before turning on the lights. We urge the public to pay attention. The precautionary alarm may last for a long time, but if there is an air raid alarm, the precautionary alert will be temporarily suspended. In any case, the blackout must be maintained until the all-clear signal is issued. In accordance with regulations, pedestrians are only allowed to proceed on the left side of the cordon ten minutes after the air raid alarm is issued.</p>
<p>Tense Situation During Last Night's Drill</p>
<p>The air defense control last night was more tense than the previous time. All Baojia personnel, self-defense corps, police air defense committee members, rescue teams, transportation teams, health teams, and fire brigades in the two concession areas of Shanghai South, Shanghai West, Zhabei, and Hongkou were mobilized, either patrolling the streets or inspecting households. All residents and shops obeyed the alarm. The precautionary alarm was issued at 1:00 PM, and those with duties in the self-defense corps were mobilized in both concessions. Rope barriers were even used to create pedestrian walkways along Avenue Edward VII. The air raid alarm was issued at 8:05 PM. Streetlights were all turned off, and aircraft ascended and circled for surveillance. The all-clear siren was issued at 9:30 PM, but the air defense alert remained in effect.</p>
<p>Police Commissioner's Remarks</p>
<p>The second full-scale air defense drill began yesterday. Police Commissioner Watanabe Tadashi of the Municipal Council issued a statement urging the people of the city to cooperate in order to enhance the efficiency of air defense. Anyone who deliberately disobeys the authorities' intentions and does not maintain proper cooperation with the local army and navy authorities will be regarded as a reactionary and punished according to law. What citizens should pay particular attention to is the recently changed alarm method. It is hoped that everyone will listen for the alarm at any time and follow the instructions. This air defense drill is much more extensive than the previous one and will include light control, sound traffic control, gas defense and rescue, and alarm transmission methods. It is also hoped that Baojia personnel and self-defense corps will be vigilant at all times during this drill and maintain security and order within their areas.</p>
<p>Form Air Defense Groups</p>
<p>Each Bao in the various districts of the Public Concession must form an air defense group, with each Bao as a unit. This air defense group is still a special and novel organization, with the Baozheng (Bao head) serving as the group leader and the Fu Baozheng (deputy Bao head) serving as the deputy group leader. Each air defense group is divided into five teams, under the command of the group leader and deputy group leader. Each team is equipped with flags and armbands for identification. The names and tasks of the five teams under the air defense group are as follows: (1) Air Surveillance Team: There must be five people on duty at all times, setting up lookout posts in high places in each Bao to specifically pay attention to whether there are aircraft sounds and whether there is any light leakage within the Bao. (2) Alarm Transmission Team. (3) Rescue Team: The task of this team is to immediately mobilize if there is an air raid and civilians are killed or injured. All children under the age of seven, elderly people over the age of seventy, and maternity patients should be escorted to a safe location. (4) Air Defense and Anti-Gas Team. (5) Traffic Control and Guard Team. At 2:00 PM this afternoon, the above-mentioned technical training will be held at the racecourse.</p>
<p>Muffle Car Horns</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office announced that the Bureau recently issued Gazette No. 6203, stipulating that during the implementation of air defense alerts, the owners of all motorcycles should reduce the sound of electric horns when pressing them so that they resemble the sound of a toy horn. The standard style of this type of horn that can be used during air defense alerts is now on display at Yangzi Motors, located on the ground floor of the Broadway Building at 10 North Suzhou Road, for public viewing. If there are any violators of the above regulations, the police will suspend their vehicle licenses. Hereby announce as above.</p>
<h3>Hawking House Rent Receipt Books to be Investigated by Authorities</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office announced that the Bureau, in view of the fact that there are unscrupulous people impersonating Bureau officials and hawking house rent receipt books to sub-landlords for the purpose of collecting rent from sub-tenants, hereby issues Gazette No. 6200, notifying sub-landlords within the Concession that if they encounter such situations, they should immediately report to the nearest police station or report to the Re-leasing License Regulations Office at Room 374 of this Bureau for investigation. Furthermore, Bureau officials carry identification documents when serving outside, and those involved may request to see them for verification.</p>
<h3>Special Rationing Handled by Sugar Industry Cooperative</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office adopted a rationing system to maintain sugar supplies, this month's sugar ration of 30,000 bags has been approved for a moving permit by the cooperative, and the goods have been transported from Pudong to the office warehouse for storage. Rationing procedures are being expedited for Class A retailers and Class B users. Sugar purchase certificates have been issued, and after they are issued, a notice will be issued to pay and pick up goods at the designated sugar shop. It is heard that the cooperatives (1) allow applications to be filed in accordance with the law for each industry's legitimate need for sugar in business, provided that the use is explained, and will be rationed after approval; (2) allow apartment tenants without house tax tickets to apply for special rations from the office with proof from the apartment. In order to strictly supervise the Class A retailers, supervisors and inspectors will be dispatched to supervise and inspect sales ledgers to prevent abuses with each issuing sugar based on house tax tickets and citizen ID. As for Class B users, the use of the sugar rationed each month should be reported in detail, and it is strictly forbidden to take advantage of the situation and distribute it privately.</p>

<h3>Forum on the Food Crisis</h3>
<p>In view of the severity of the Shanghai food crisis, our newspaper has twice published articles on the matter, and we hope that all sectors of society will express their opinions, so as to arrive at concrete and reasonable conclusions, and contribute to the authorities' adoption of these. Recently, Mr. Yuan Ludeng, chairman of the Shanghai Special City Chamber of Commerce, took the lead in submitting a written opinion, all of which suggestions are timely and appropriate, and address practical counter-measures. Therefore, we have specially opened this forum for publication, and still hope that all sectors will put forward concrete suggestions, and learn from each other. We would be very grateful.</p>
<p>Opinions on Rice Rationing</p>
<p>Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are the four major elements of people's lives, especially food, which is indispensable for even a single day. As the saying goes, "Food is the most important thing for the people." Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the number of ships has decreased over the years, transportation has become difficult, and rice prices have gradually risen. Due to the lack of sources of foreign rice, the authorities have implemented control over food such as rice and flour, and rationed it based on population. From July 6 to December 10, nineteen rations have been distributed. From the first to the eleventh rations, each ration was for one week. From the twelfth to the nineteenth rations, each ration was for ten days. The quantity of each ration was, on average, one and a half "sheng" of rice (white rice or broken rice) and one and a half "jin" of flour. Initially, the citizens already felt that the quantity for each week was insufficient, roughly enough for four days' meals for an average appetite, and there was no solution for the remaining three days. When it was changed to a ten-day ration, the insufficiency was even worse, so they had no choice but to rely on the black market for a full meal. However, apart from a very small number of citizens above the middle class who had some savings, the majority of ordinary citizens felt greatly troubled. In the past, when rations were distributed once a week, the demand for black market rice was not very high, so the official ration price was 25 yuan per "dou" of national currency, and the black market price was only about 40 yuan. By the time of the autumn harvest in various places, when new grains were available, it was logical that rice prices should gradually fall, but in reality, the opposite was true. Recently, the price has even increased to about 100 yuan per "dou," which is truly an unprecedentedly high price in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad. The reason for this is that the rice stored in each household has been exhausted, the rationing period has been extended to ten days, and broken rice is more abundant than white rice in each ration. Although an additional half "jin" of flour can be purchased, the quantity is limited and not enough to make up for the shortage. As a result, the demand for food has suddenly become high, and the price of rice on the black market has continued to rise. Efforts should be made to improve the situation in order to ensure the stability of people's lives. Therefore, concrete opinions on rationing are described in detail below.</p>
<p>A. Advantages and Disadvantages of Movement Restrictions</p>
<p>The control of materials is indeed a necessary phenomenon in wartime, and food, in particular, should be subject to control. However, the control methods are indeed worth discussing. For example, the quantity of each ration must be suitable for the average person's food consumption, so that the rations of each household do not need to rely on the black market again. The black market will naturally disappear, and the profiteers will have no way to hoard. The general public's panic about food and the burden of high rice prices can be alleviated. Currently, because the quantity of rations based on population is insufficient and the quality of rice is too poor, citizens have no choice but to seek help from peddlers. The authorities' restrictions on the movement of rice and grain have clearly stipulated that no one may exceed two "dou." However, the common villagers who are peddlers want to enter the concessions from the cordon. [Redacted text due to degradation] Great difficulty. [Redacted text due to degradation] See each grain of rice as something acquired at the risk of one’s life, something more precious than pearls. The more difficulties encountered along the way, the more the rice price in the central area of the concession rises; this is inevitable.</p>
<p>It has been found that Jiang, Zhejiang, and Anhui have fortunately had good harvests this year. According to general knowledge, when new grains are available, rice prices should normally fall. Therefore, in various counties along the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou railway line, the price of new rice is generally between 220 yuan and 250 yuan per "shi." If the authorities did not strictly restrict the entry of rice, how could the price of rice in the concession be as high as about 100 yuan per "dou," which is a difference of 700 to 800 yuan per "shi" compared to the rice prices in neighboring counties? This kind of malignant deformity is truly an unprecedented oddity. The restriction on the movement of rice and grain by the concession authorities is to prevent a small number of people from hoarding and speculating. The cordon's restriction on the entry of rice and grain has resulted in the above-mentioned phenomenon. Not only do the majority of citizens suffer greatly in their lives, it also directly stimulates the surge in other general prices and labor costs, indirectly hindering the implementation of price control policies, and at the same time, it also affects the rice prices and commodity prices outside of Shanghai. Guan Zhong of the Spring and Autumn period and Chao Cuo of the Han Dynasty said: "When clothing and food are insufficient, the people have little sense of shame." "When the granaries are full, then they know etiquette; when clothing and food are sufficient, then they know honor and disgrace." If we continue in this way without changing the current customs, an economic crisis will inevitably develop into a political crisis, because "the people are the foundation of the state; when the foundation is solid, the state is secure." We sincerely hope that the authorities, under the premise of "making the people have enough food," will quickly seek a symptomatic solution. Not only should any passive restrictions on movement and prohibitions on the inflow of rice be lifted, but we also hope that businesses will be actively encouraged to purchase and transport rice in large quantities to relieve the suffering of the citizens.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the abolition of any movement restrictions and prohibitions on the inflow of rice seems to be one-sidedly passive. What is more actively needed is that all restrictions on the export and movement of any rice in general peaceful areas should also be lifted, restoring its freedom of operation, while restricting its manipulation and hoarding, and at the same time vigorously correcting any form of oppression and extortion. For example, if the price of rice in Suzhou is 250 yuan per "shi," and it is transported to Shanghai, after paying regular taxes and all legitimate transportation costs, for example, 280 yuan, then the selling price in Shanghai should be at most 300 yuan per "shi," which is already a generous profit. However, the actual selling price is as high as 900 yuan. [Redacted text due to degradation] Thus, consumers bear extra damage, which is something that everyone abhors and deeply regrets.</p>
<p>B. Opinions on the Rice Ticket System</p>
<p>Since the two concession authorities implemented rice and grain rationing in July of this year, the practice of milling rice has begun to subside. If the quantity of rations is increased, then all problems can be solved. Now that the quantity of rations is insufficient, there is no point in talking about the rice ticket system. However, if it is replaced with a rice ticket system, a suitable amount of rice tickets should be issued daily based on population. If meals are eaten at home, then the rice tickets can be used by the household to purchase rice from rice shops. If meals are eaten in groups or banquets, then each diner can provide a rice ticket, so that the caterer can use the tickets to purchase rice from rice shops. In this way, there will be no duplication, and statistics can be more accurate. The difficulty is that Shanghai is a mixed settlement, with a dense network of transportation lines. Every day, there are tens of thousands of merchants and travelers coming and going. For example, when taking the Beijing-Shanghai train to Shanghai, about three thousand passengers arrive at each station. Have all the ports implemented population-based rationing? Do the people carry rice tickets with them? Even if they do, can the rice tickets from other ports be used by Shanghai restaurants to purchase rice in Shanghai after they have collected them? Or do rice shops accumulate a certain number of tickets and then exchange them with other ports? This is indeed a problem. Therefore, unless the entire country implements population-based rationing, and the quantity and price are the same, the implementation of the rice ticket system is not easy to say.</p>
<p>In summary, we sincerely ask the authorities to consider implementing the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Increase the amount of rations per person and improve the quality of the rations, so that every citizen does not have to half starve.</p>
<p>(2) Thoroughly allow peddlers to carry rice into the city for sale, but limit the appropriate selling price.</p>
<p>(3) Open up the interior, and encourage the authorities to encourage businesses to transport rice to Shanghai to provide a steady supply.</p>
<p>In short, we believe that the food problem in Shanghai is a serious problem that directly affects the interests of all citizens, and has a close and significant impact on the political, economic, and security situation in Shanghai and peaceful areas. We hope that the authorities will act swiftly and thoroughly to seek thorough remedies and fundamental solutions.</p>

<h3>Deadline for Cloth Registration; Investigation to Begin Soon; Numerous Entries Prevented Full Accommodation; Schedule Fixed for Completion Within Five Days</h3>
<p>A notice from the Intelligence Department of the Public Works Department states: Since the Bureau began processing cloth registration on the 10th of this month, the process has been relatively smooth. The registration process is limited to the 15th of this month. All relevant persons who have not yet registered must come to the Bureau for registration before the evening of this day and must not delay any further. Goods not registered after the deadline will be confiscated once discovered, and the owners will be penalized. Furthermore, the inventory registration information must be accurate. If any inaccuracies are found, the same regulations as mentioned above will be applied.</p>
<p>Registration Receipts Must Be Preserved</p>
<p>The Bureau intends to send personnel to investigate the accuracy of the registered inventory. Therefore, any relevant person who ignores this registration matter will inevitably incur serious consequences. The Bureau will issue a registration receipt to each registrant. This receipt must be properly preserved, as it is absolutely necessary for the future sale of cloth and can also be used as proof that the goods have been registered in accordance with regulations when Bureau investigators come to investigate the inventory.</p>
<p>Inability to Process; Numbers Assigned</p>
<p>According to a notice from the Intelligence Department of the Public Works Department, the Bureau recently issued Notice No. 6204, stating that all those who came to the Bureau to register cloth inventory but could not be accommodated on the 14th due to the large number of people have been temporarily assigned a number by the Bureau. Persons with this number should follow the schedule below and return to the Bureau to complete the registration procedures on the specified dates within this month:</p>
<p>Numbers 1001 to 2000: 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM on the 15th</p>
<p>Numbers 2001 to 2600: 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM on the 15th</p>
<p>Numbers 2601 to 3200: 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM on the 16th</p>

<p>Numbers 5001 to 5600: 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM on the 18th</p>
<p>Numbers 5601 to 6200: 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM on the 18th</p>
<p>Numbers 6201 to 7000: 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM on the 19th</p>
<p>Registration Procedures for Pledged Cloth</p>
<p>A notice from the United Association of Silver Shops to its members states: Regarding the Public Works Department's announcement setting a deadline for the registration of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, the Association issued a notice on the 3rd of this month. Regarding the registration procedures, the Association has now inquired with the responsible person of the Bureau. All cotton yarn exceeding 400 pounds and cotton cloth exceeding 40 "pi" stored as of 5:00 PM on the 10th of this month must be registered by the owner before the 15th. In addition to registering their own goods, each shop should notify the mortgagors to directly register the pledged cloth (those whose warehouse receipts are under the shop's name should still be registered by the owner). After the mortgagor completes the registration, they should notify the pledgee of the registration certificate number for verification. As for the registration of warehouses, there is no specific form. The warehouses only need to register at the same time the type, quantity, warehouse receipt number, consignor's name, and contact information of the stored cloth.</p>
<p>Submit Cloth Samples for Review</p>
<p>A notice from the Dyeing, Weaving, and Cotton Cloth Industry Association states: This Association is now collecting trademarks and cloth samples from member factories for the registration of processed cotton cloth (including dyed and finished cloth) in order to forward them for review and facilitate sales in the market. Members are requested to collect forms from their respective associations within three days, fill them out truthfully, and submit them to the Association by the 18th of this month. This matter is in the interest of the members themselves, so please do not hesitate and delay, lest you miss the opportunity.</p>
<h3>Fundraising for the Pushan Villa</h3>
<p>Regular Beijing Opera Performances Scheduled</p>
<p>The Pushan Villa in this city has a history of thirty years since its establishment by Mr. Wang Junsheng. It is now co-sponsored by Mr. Yuan Ludeng, President of the Leshan Society in Shanghai, as well as Le Genbao, Li Wencai, Li Xiaobao, Wu Rend, Ma Ziyun, and all members of the Society, to hold voluntary Beijing Opera performances, inviting famous actors, talented young women, and prominent ladies to perform grand performances at the Queen's Theatre on Yu Qiaqing Road on the 17th of this month. The ticket prices are divided into several types, including honorary seats for 100 yuan, and ordinary seats for 50 yuan, 30 yuan, 20 yuan, and 10 yuan. All income from the performances will be used to fund the charitable expenses of the Villa.</p>
<h3>Agreement Reached on Coal Imports; Coal Prices to Be Fixed; Coal from Central China Can Now Be Imported in Large Quantities; French Authorities to Severely Punish Illegal Shops</h3>
<p>According to the English-language *Shanghai Times*, a senior official from the Price Control Office of the French Municipal Council revealed that the price of coal by the "jin" will be fixed in the near future, and the authorities have also reached an agreement with the authorities in Central China to import coal in large quantities.</p>
<p>Coal Prices Based on Quality</p>
<p>It is said that the price of coal per ton will be determined according to its quality, ranging from 704 yuan to 874 yuan. The best quality coal can be sold for 874 yuan per ton, while coal produced in Shandong will be set at 704 yuan per ton. It is also said that the agreement between the authorities on the large-scale import of coal has been completed.</p>
<p>Continued Difficulties in Controlling Vegetable Prices</p>
<p>Regarding the turmoil in vegetable prices in recent weeks, the official stated that this is one of the most difficult problems for the authorities to control prices. Vegetable prices must be determined entirely by the conditions of the farmland around Shanghai, such as harvest supply and demand and yarn transportation. For example, the price increase of potatoes is due to the recent sudden cooling of the weather, which has reduced the production of potatoes transported from the suburbs to the concessions. Although speculation is also a factor in price increases, natural causes can indeed increase vegetable prices.</p>
<h3>The Control Committee Purchases New Cotton and Implements the Rationing System; An Agreement Is Reached With the Jiangsu Construction Bureau Regarding Purchase Methods; Sino-Japanese Textile Factories Sell at Limited Prices</h3>
<p>In order to control the purchase of cotton in peaceful areas and implement a rationing system, the Central China Cotton Control Committee allocates cotton to textile factories in Shanghai, Nantong, Suzhou, Wujin, Taicang, and Wuxi as raw materials for spinning yarn and weaving cloth. Now, cotton companies in southern Jiangsu and northern Jiangsu have been established one after another to purchase cotton in designated areas according to the limited prices set by the Control Committee. An agreement has been reached with the Jiangsu Construction Bureau regarding purchase methods to absolutely eliminate illegal activities such as adulteration. As for prices, the limited prices must be followed. It is reported that the cotton already collected in various places, in addition to being allocated to local textile factories, has been shipped to Shanghai, and it is allocated to the Sino-Japanese textile factories and military-managed factories in Shanghai according to their actual needs. The factories have been supplied with raw materials in order to increase production, and they will gradually restore the yarn spindles. As for the spun yarn, it will be sold according to the maximum limited prices of cloth announced by the authorities.</p>
<p>130,000 "Dan" Have Been Collected in Various Places</p>
<p>From the 1st to the 10th of this month, 130,000 "dan" of cotton have been collected in various places, of which 10,000 "dan" have been shipped to Shanghai and allocated to various factories for use as raw materials. It is reported that Japanese merchants such as Rihwa, Obun, Toyota, Yufeng, and Tohwa in Shanghai, as well as Chinese merchants such as Shenxin, Wing On, Xinyu, Hongzhang, Hefeng, Gong Yongbao, Fengqin, and military-managed factories, have been supplied with raw materials and are increasing production, first restoring the spindles that were previously reduced, and then gradually restoring the number of workers depending on the actual sales of cloth. The spun yarn is sold according to the maximum limited prices of cloth stipulated by the authorities.</p>
<p>Shanghai Cotton Management Area to Establish Breeding Grounds</p>
<p>In order to promote the increase in cotton production, the Ministry of Industry plans to establish cotton seed breeding grounds in the Shanghai, northern Jiangsu, and Nanjing management areas to promote the improvement of cotton production quality. It is learned that the Shanghai Cotton Industry Management Area Office of the Ministry has already planned to select and purchase 600 "dan" of high-quality cotton seeds from Jiangyin and set up breeding grounds in the three locations of Beiqiao, Chongming, and Nanhui in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Winter Sanitation Campaign Convention to Be Held Today</h3>
<p>In order to promote public health among citizens, the municipal government will hold a winter sanitation campaign convention at 10:00 AM today (the 15th). The convention venue will be located in the assembly hall of the Confucian Temple on Wenmiao Road in the southern city. The mayor has been invited to serve as the chairman of the convention. Representatives from various friendly organizations, bureau chiefs, heads of various agencies, neighborhood chiefs, students, and others will attend. The winter sanitation campaign convention will include health exhibitions, health check-ups, and lectures.</p>
<h3>Financial Office Implements Inspections of Business Operations</h3>
<p>In accordance with the "Provisional Measures for the Administration of Financial Institutions" and its implementing regulations, silver shops and other financial institutions are required to pay a fixed amount of current deposit reserve funds in order to protect depositors. The institutions have already paid the reserve funds into the designated reserve accounts at the Central Reserve Bank based on the deposit amounts at the end of November. It is reported that the Financial and Military Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank, in order to supervise the operations of the financial institutions, will send personnel to inspect the assets, liabilities, and business operations of each institution in accordance with the laws and regulations. Any institutions found to be violating the laws and regulations or conducting illegal business activities will be corrected and dealt with according to law.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over Capital Increase at Tong Yi Trust Company</h3>
<p>Recently, there has been a surge in enthusiasm for Chinese shares. Newly established companies are springing up like mushrooms after rain, and companies undergoing capital increases and reorganizations are also numerous. Recently, a dispute over a capital increase at the Tong Yi Trust Company on Beijing Road has resulted in a lawsuit in the civil court of the First Special Court. The plaintiffs are Hong Ji and others, representing Le Shinong and others, and the defendants are the standing directors of the company.</p>
<p>Resolution Deemed Invalid</p>
<p>The cause of the lawsuit is illegal capital increase and infringement of shareholders' rights. The plaintiffs request that the resolution on the capital increase and the resolutions of the old and new shareholders' meetings on the capital increase be declared invalid, that the newly elected directors and supervisors should immediately cease their activities, that the company should be restored to its state before August 23, and that the costs of the lawsuit should be borne. The main point is that in 1936, the company was declared bankrupt by the court for embezzling more than 1.3 million public debt certificates deposited by depositors. Later, a settlement plan was established to turn the original creditors into shareholders.</p>
<p>Infringement of Old Shareholders' Rights</p>
<p>The company resumed operations in 1938 and has been in business for five years. Commodity prices have soared, and the company's assets have exceeded the total capital by three to four times. The shareholders believe that the previous losses can now be compensated. Unexpectedly, the company's responsible persons, i.e., the defendants, took advantage of the fact that the old shareholders were scattered all over the country and convened a shareholders' meeting in August. Because the legal quorum was not met, they made a false resolution on the capital increase issue, authorizing the board of directors to be responsible for handling it. The capital was increased by 1.5 million, and in October, the directors and supervisors were re-elected. Of the 20 members, the new shareholders accounted for 17. Assuming that the capital of the old shareholders was 100 units and the company's assets were 3 million, the old shareholders could earn 2 million. Now, 1.5 million new shares are added, which can be jointly distributed with the previous surplus. Therefore, the plaintiffs request the above. The case was heard yesterday morning, and after an interrogation, it was decided to reschedule the hearing.</p>
<h3>In Order to Make Food Control More Effective, Restrictions on Issuing New Licenses; Opening New Shops Requires Prior Written Request</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department recently issued Notice No. 6202, stating that in order to make the distribution and sale of controlled foods more effective, it has been decided to restrict the issuance of new licenses for certain types of food shops. Therefore, citizens planning to establish such new shops should, for their own benefit, submit a written request to the License Office of the Revenue Department of the Bureau in advance to inquire whether it is possible to obtain a license in order to be cautious. For the types of food shops with restricted licenses, please refer to the above-mentioned notice.</p>

<p>Business News</p>
<h3>Textile Stocks Fall First Along With Yarn Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market first rose and then suddenly fell back. In the end, the gains barely exceeded the losses. Initially, it flourished on the momentum of the previous weekend. Around 10:30, it was suddenly shrouded in unfavorable rumors, and as yarn prices fell, the textile industry took the first hit. Other stocks also fell accordingly. Public utilities had many twists and turns. Zhabei Water and Electricity plunged from 66.75 yuan to 4.5 yuan, closing at 4 yuan. Chinese Electrical Engineering retreated from 46 yuan to 4.5 yuan, closing at 45 yuan, still up 1.5 yuan. Great China Match was always being bought and rose 17.5 yuan, reaching 375 yuan. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco remained steady between 127 and 128 yuan. Among the new pharmaceutical stocks, Five Continents Pharmacy had few sales and rose 25 yuan, reaching 550 yuan, but it was not easy to buy. Most of the others were flat or sluggish. Among the Sino-French small stocks, Xinyi fell 15 yuan to 275 yuan. Sinya broke through the 70 yuan mark again, seeing an unprecedented high price of 71.5 yuan, but then quickly retreated 3 yuan, closing at 69 yuan with few buyers. Minyi traded around 90 yuan, all seeing flat settlements. Star Perfume had a transaction at 232.5 yuan. Among the cultural stocks, only Commercial Press rose 5 yuan to 465 yuan. China traded between 205 yuan and 210 yuan. The World traded around 116 yuan, each up or down 2 yuan. In the department store sector, Wing On, Sincere, and China General Merchandise all rose by 1 or 2 yuan. Wing On once touched 140 yuan. Sincere retreated immediately after breaking through 150 yuan. China General Merchandise was at 82 yuan. China Underwear also rose 1.25 yuan, reaching 35.25 yuan. In the textile industry, Wing On Textile once soared to 1,980 yuan, then retreated to 1,920 yuan, still up 20 yuan. Small-denomination stocks only saw Fuchang Dyeing and Weaving rise to 16 yuan. Hongsheng and Great China Weaving each advanced within 10 yuan. Ningbo Weaving was only at 8 yuan, already below par. Other stocks were mostly flat. The trading was not dull. The list is shown below.</p>
<h3>Public Debt Trading Scanty</h3>
<p>Public debt trading remained without formal buying or selling. Transactions were extremely scarce, and prices varied widely, with no consistency. Yesterday, the C bond once reached 8 yuan, but it also traded at 6 yuan. A more realistic price was 7.45 yuan. There was not much difference between A and C bonds. B bonds were at 55 or 56 yuan, D bonds were from 2.5 yuan to 4 yuan, and E bonds were at 55 yuan. The public debt situation seems to be fading away.</p>
<h3>One Day Left in Registration Deadline; Piece Goods Weak and Unbearable</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: The market for factory cloth yesterday was weak due to the deadline for registering cloth inventory being only today. Retailers continued to sell off in order to avoid the trouble of registering, so the market was weak. White cotton cloth and coarse cloth from local factories had few sales, and asking prices varied, seemingly entering a standstill state. The midday closing price for Peach Blossom Lady's and Factory-branded single-color cloth was 301.5 yuan, but the spot price rose to 304 yuan. There were still few supplies.</p>
<p>East Cloth: The market also rose first and then fell, and trading was exceptionally quiet. The midday closing price for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 191 yuan, down 1.5 yuan. The bank price was 190.5 yuan, Colorful Ball was 191 yuan, and Yanghe was 190 yuan. The opening price for Four Gentlemen serge was 7.65 yuan, rising to 7.73 yuan, but then fell to 7.55 yuan due to sales by retailers outside the industry. However, the spot price on the floor was 7.7 yuan with buyers, which was also an anomaly.</p>
<h3>Gold Jewelry Exchange Rate Unchanged; Intra-Industry Bidding Slightly Higher</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai silversmith industry's Daxin Tonghang gold jewelry retail price remained at 3,350 yuan per tael (purchase price reduced by two hundred and several tens of yuan). Unofficial inter-dealer trading occurred at 3,220 yuan, up 50 yuan. Buying momentum pushed the highest price to 3,280 yuan, stabilizing at noon, and finally settling at 3,260 yuan, 90 yuan higher than last Saturday, with a range of 60 yuan. Trading was thin. Silver jewelry remained at 16 yuan per tael, with Hengfu listed at 18 yuan. Intra-industry trading prices ranged between 18 and 15 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the bill market showed little change. The intra-industry buying and selling price remained consistently between 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, 3 li, and 5 hao. The cash price was around 5 fen. Banks and small money shops quoted buying and selling prices between 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 4 fen, 5 li, and 6 fen.</p>
<h3>British and American Discount Cigarettes to be Widely Sold</h3>
<p>Cigarette trading continued outside the market, but the market was lower compared to the weekend. This was because British and American discount cigarettes would soon be widely sold, distributed to retailers by major A and B grade dealers in the city. This significantly dampened market sentiment, causing prices to stop rising and become weak. "Big British" brand traded at 9,150 yuan, "Old Knife" brand at 8,300 yuan, "Pinhai" brand at 8,100 yuan, "Wuhua" brand at 6,400 yuan, "Fairy" brand at 7,500 yuan, with small fluctuations of 100-200 yuan. Japanese cigarettes: "Golden Spear" brand at 3,000 yuan, "Golden Mansion" at 3,450 yuan, "Red Rose" at 2,700 yuan, "All Luck" brand at 3,100 yuan, "Guide" brand at 2,300 yuan. Domestic cigarettes: "Pyramid" at 6,400 yuan, "Beauty" at 5,900 yuan, "Golden Mouse" at 3,900 yuan. The trend remains stable.</p>
<h3>Local Factory Woolen Cloth Production Decreases</h3>
<p>Circulating woolen cloth is increasingly scarce because imports have been cut off for a long time. Local factories lack raw materials; even scraps of wool and hair are hard to find. Consequently, the output of both Chinese and Japanese factories is decreasing rather than increasing. However, due to continuous actual sales and widespread hoarding, prices are rising steadily, with a brisk and unusual trend.</p>

<p>Special Issue on Health Campaign</p>
<h3>The Significance of the Health Campaign</h3>
<p>— Chen Gongbo</p>
<p>Today is the day our city holds its winter health campaign. While most people understand the importance of health campaigns to some extent, many fail to grasp it deeply. Those with a superficial understanding often believe that health simply means cleanliness, and that cleanliness only requires a clean surface. Little do they know that health issues are related to the health of the nation and can affect the rise and fall of the country!</p>
<p>It should be understood that the people are the elements that constitute the country. If all the people are healthy in body and mind, then all political constructions can achieve sound development, making it easy to bring the country into a realm of prosperity and strength. Looking back at our country's situation, although we have a population of 400 million, if health checks were conducted using scientific standards, the number of those who would be eliminated would probably be considerable, wouldn't it?</p>
<p>This is not an intentional exaggeration to cause alarm, but rather based on factual evidence. For example, our country's mortality rate is twice that of civilized countries, resulting in the needless sacrifice of six million people each year. And the number of citizens who are chronically ill, unable to produce, and in need of relief, although there are no accurate statistics, must be considerable. These unfavorable conditions are all weaknesses of the country. To correct these weaknesses one by one, the country and the nation can be saved.</p>
<p>Although the work of saving the country is not limited to health, health should be the priority: because health is the mother of all undertakings. Without a healthy people as the foundation, everything is empty talk. We now need to save the country through peace, but empty talk will not help. It is hoped that after this winter health campaign, everyone will know the importance of health. On an individual level, clothing, food, housing, and transportation must all comply with health standards. In terms of public health, everyone should rise up to maintain and organize it together. The municipal government is very attentive to the popularization of health education in order to encourage citizens to pay attention to and practice health. The Nanshi district is the first health education experimental zone, and in the future, all districts will uniformly promote health education. Today's health campaign is one method of promoting health education. It is hoped that all citizens of the city will study health and practice health. This is the basic work of saving the country, and only then can saving the country through peace succeed, and we can shoulder the responsibility of building a Greater East Asia and fulfill our great mission!</p>
<h3>To Prevent Smallpox, Vaccination is a Must</h3>
<p>Cause: Smallpox (i.e., variola) is caused by infection with a natural smallpox virus. It is most likely to spread in the spring and winter seasons. Once discovered, anyone in close proximity to the patient is very likely to be infected through contact.</p>
<p>Main Symptoms: After an incubation period of ten to fourteen days after infection, there are prodromal symptoms such as chills, fever, headache, vomiting, pain in the limbs, delirium, drowsiness, cough, shortness of breath, and inflammation of the eyes and throat. Soon, smallpox lesions appear all over the face, torso, and limbs. At the same time, important organs such as the heart, brain, and nerves are affected by the smallpox virus, often leading to dangerous complications and death!</p>
<p>Prevention and Treatment: The only effective way to prevent it is to get vaccinated quickly! Increase the body's resistance to the virus to avoid harm; if it unfortunately occurs, it should be sent to a contagious isolation hospital for diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible to avoid the danger of spreading to the whole family or neighbors. Given that winter is a period when smallpox easily spreads, it is hoped that the public will pay close attention to it and not neglect the importance of vaccination!</p>
<h3>The Sage Treats Unborn Disease</h3>
<p>— Zhao Zunhuo</p>
<h3>The Purpose of the Health Campaign</h3>
<p>— Mei</p>
<p>The purpose of the health campaign is to popularize health education and promote public health. This is the basic work of strengthening the country and the people. However, the meaning of health is very broad, and the departments involved are very complex. It is by no means enough for the government to simply promote health campaigns to fulfill the duties of public health. It can only be said that the promotion of public health should start with health campaigns. Public health includes various sciences, but our people, apart from general experts, have not only not studied public health, but probably do not have a full understanding of ordinary health knowledge. To enable the people to understand ordinary health knowledge, it all depends on the promotion of health education, and holding health campaigns is one way to promote health education. Because health campaigns use various propaganda methods to make the people aware of the importance of health. For example, thorough cleaning can make people aware that dirt is harmful to health; careful eating and drinking can make people aware of fewer diseases; preventive injections can resist the spread of epidemics; eliminating mosquitoes and flies can reduce the spread of epidemics, etc. All health knowledge should enable the people to move from awareness to attention, and from attention to practice. By gradually extending it from a small number of people to a large number and seeking its universality, the health campaign can be considered valuable, health education can have results, and the purpose of promoting public health can be achieved. Because the public has universally received health education, they can understand the importance of public health, and all health undertakings will be easily promoted. Once promoted without obstruction, the level of personal health can be improved, and the life span of human beings can be extended. Personal health can be improved to increase the strength of the entire nation; at the same time, the ability of people to produce can be increased, reducing the huge and intangible consumption of the economy, and the prosperity of the country can be expected. Therefore, it is no mistake to say that the health campaign is the beginning of strengthening the country and the people.</p>
<h3>Be Careful of Carbon Monoxide Poisoning</h3>
<p>Cause</p>
<p>When coal burns, a odorless, tasteless, and highly toxic gas (chemical name carbon monoxide) is produced. More of it is produced when burning is not vigorous. If the concentration of carbon monoxide in the indoor air is more than 0.5%, it can be fatal. In winter, if you take fire for heating, you should take precautions or there may be a tragic change of carbon monoxide poisoning.</p>
<p>Prevention</p>
<p>(1) When burning coal, it should be burned vigorously in a ventilated and open place before being brought into the room.</p>
<p>(2) If it is an immovable stove, the windows and doors should be opened when burning coal.</p>
<p>(3) When a coal stove or fireplace is burning in the room, the windows or doors should be opened as appropriate, at least for three to five minutes every hour, in order to exchange air.</p>
<p>(4) A kettle or basin of water should be placed on the stove.</p>
<p>(5) Do not burn a stove in the room after going to bed.</p>
<p>First aid</p>
<p>If, unfortunately, you have already been poisoned by coal, quickly open the windows and immediately move the patient to a place with plenty of air. At the same time, quickly ask a doctor for diagnosis and treatment. If the patient has difficulty breathing or weak breathing, perform artificial respiration immediately.</p>
<h3>Beware of Diphtheria</h3>
<p>Cause</p>
<p>Due to the invasion of diphtheria bacilli. For example, eating, sleeping, sitting together, or talking face-to-face with patients, or using bowls and chopsticks together can all be transmitted, and it is especially fond of invading children under the age of ten.</p>
<p>Main Symptoms</p>
<p>Two to seven days after the bacterium invades, a membrane forms in the throat or nasal cavity, causing difficulty in swallowing, swelling and pain in the cervical glands, difficulty in breathing, and hoarseness. If medical treatment is not sought immediately, death will occur due to blood poisoning.</p>
<p>Prevention</p>
<p>Do not get close to patients or share utensils to avoid infection. Children without the disease can undergo the Schick test first. If unfortunately infected with diphtheria, seek medical attention immediately.</p>
<h3>What We Should Know About the Health Campaign</h3>
<p>— Shiliang</p>
<p>Thirty years ago, apart from a few people with new knowledge who could understand the word "health", the general public did not know what health was. In recent years, although the word "health" has been known to everyone, what is the meaning of health? How important is health? I am afraid that the general public has not yet deeply understood it!</p>
<p>Holding a health campaign is to awaken the general public's attention to health. It can also be said that it is a concrete manifestation of promoting health education. This kind of movement is rarely seen internationally. Because the education level of the general public in our country is low, the government must promote health campaigns to encourage the public to pay attention to health.</p>
<p>The completion of public health must be based on personal health. Because the conditions for personal health are relatively easy to achieve, anyone who has received education can always understand some health knowledge, and can maintain at least personal health. However, relying solely on a narrow definition of personal health while neglecting family health and social health is still not thorough. If you encounter the spread of infectious diseases, you still cannot avoid the danger of infection. Especially those who only value private morality and disregard public morality, pay attention to cleanliness on their own bodies, but can ignore it in their families, or pay attention to cleanliness at home, but do not pay attention to public health, and dump garbage, mud, feces, and sewage from their own homes on the road, hindering public health. This kind of behavior is really too naive, and the result is still hindering themselves. Because the occurrence of infectious diseases is caused by these many wastes, especially in summer, the bacteria contained in these many garbage, after the evaporation of the sun or the medium of mosquitoes and flies, infectious diseases are naturally easy to occur. For example, once cholera breaks out and spreads, it is extremely fast. Once a person gets sick, it can immediately infect everyone in the neighborhood, even a town, a county, a province, or a country. To investigate the reasons, it is all due to the people's lack of health knowledge, so the government must promote health campaigns to make the people of the whole country pay attention to the importance of health.</p>
<p>The purpose of the health campaign is to reduce diseases, so that all citizens have a healthy body, increase life expectancy, and do the great cause of enriching the country and strengthening the people. To achieve this goal, we must all take on the responsibility of transforming environmental hygiene, cleaning up road garbage, removing household waste, cleaning toilets and kitchens, and eliminating mosquitoes and flies. This is the most important work in improving environmental hygiene, but this kind of work will never be successful by holding a health campaign once. The health campaign is just to take advantage of this day to awaken the general public to have a real understanding of the word "health", and to promote everyone to develop healthy habits, which can protect the life safety of the public, and at the same time reduce the disease rate and mortality rate. However, health work is not a one-sided matter for the people, nor can it be done solely by the power of the government. We must cooperate with each other to achieve the health of the people, the happiness of society, and the prosperity of the country.</p>
<h3>A Letter to the Citizens for the First Winter Health Campaign in Our City</h3>
<p>— Yuan Jufan</p>
<p>Citizens:</p>
<p>Now the winter health campaign has opened again. When it comes to health issues, all knowledgeable citizens recognize its importance. But the general public often has some misunderstandings, thinking that during the summer epidemic, we should pay attention to health, but as the weather turns cooler, gradually from autumn to winter, the epidemic disappears, and the threat to life has been lifted, so we can rest easy.</p>
<p>In fact, health problems cannot be neglected at any time. Although several kinds of bacteria are easy to breed in summer and can kill people in an instant, there are also some bacteria that are not afraid of the cold and still threaten our lives in winter, such as smallpox, typhoid fever, bacillary dysentery, influenza, upper respiratory tract inflammation and other diseases, which can also spread in winter, so I hope everyone will pay attention to prevention.</p>
<p>The method of health should be cleanliness as the first priority. If the body and environment are clean and tidy, the bacteria will have nowhere to parasitize and multiply. If we have not developed the habit of loving cleanliness, we do not change our clothes often, do not trim our hair often, nor do we take baths often, it is easy to parasitize fleas and lice, and spread diseases such as plague, typhus, recurrent fever, and trench fever. Also, spitting and defecating indiscriminately, or dumping garbage indiscriminately, not only damages the city's appearance and willingly exposes unhygienic bad habits, bringing shame to the nation and the country, but also spreads bacteria such as tuberculosis, typhoid fever, and dysentery, endangering national health and affecting the national economy.</p>
<p>I hope that citizens will recognize the meaning and value of health, and examine themselves to see if they have developed the necessary health habits in terms of personal health? Has family health been improved? Have the rules of public health been followed? If everyone can pay attention to these issues and put them into practice, individuals can be healthy, families can be happy, and the country can be strong.</p>
<p>Therefore, when we hold this health campaign, please pay attention to health issues, thoroughly wash away all past unhygienic habits, and re-establish a healthy and happy outlook on life, so as to achieve our expected goals and complete the great mission of strengthening the country and the people. This is the sincere hope of our association for all citizens!</p>
<h3>Thoughts on the Winter Health Campaign Conference</h3>
<p>— Yuan Houzhi</p>
<p>The first winter health campaign conference in our city was held on December 15th, which is indeed an urgent matter. Although the three aspects of morality, intelligence, and physical education are said to be equally important, the physical aspect is actually the main one. If the physique is weak, or even if death does not exist, even if there is morality and intelligence, what is the use of it? If Yan Yuan had morality but died young, or if Ran Boniu had a serious illness, even though morality was in the body and not applied to others, what is the value of having it? The same is true for intelligence. Jia Yi had the talent of Wang Zuo, but only lived to be thirty-three years old; Li He's poetry was unmatched, but he was only twenty-seven years old. They all ended their lives prematurely and did not complete their use. However, if the American Edison lived to be eighty-five years old, and his important invention, the electric light, has benefited all mankind to this day, then it was mostly after the age of forty-nine. Also, if the German Roentgen lived to seventy-nine, and his invention of X-rays was already at the age of fifty-one. If these two people had only lived as long as Jia Yi and Li He, how could they have had this? If the skin does not exist, where will the hair be attached? This is the natural principle. Although a person's life is predestined, those who are good at nourishing themselves have a way to maintain their health, and it is not impossible to conquer nature with human effort. As Ji Shuye said, "If you cultivate in the time of soup, even if you have the merit of one watering, although you will eventually return to scorching heat, you must be watered before you wither." The most common and widespread disease among our people is tuberculosis, almost nine out of ten people suffer from it. According to the weekly reports of the Shanghai Concession Public Health Office on the mortality rate of the people, those who die from tuberculosis often account for more than 70%. However, it is not impossible to prevent it. In European and American countries with the most flourishing culture and science, the tuberculosis mortality rate has been reduced to less than 10%. Other diseases such as cholera, typhoid fever, scarlet fever, diphtheria, and red and white dysentery are all caused by dietary imbalances and bacterial activity. Those with severe cases die, and those with mild cases become seriously ill. If they knew a little about hygiene, did not eat food contaminated by flies, did not drink unclean water, and dressed and lived in accordance with their needs, how could this have happened? Although it is said that when diseases come, there are medicines that can cure them. However, medicine treats what has already happened. Rather than treating what has already happened, it is better to prevent it before it happens. As for planning ahead and preventing diseases in the subtle, it is hygiene that is valued. Medicine is for those who are burnt out, and moving the chimney is hygiene. Medicine is the end, and hygiene is the root. If hygiene is effective, and everyone can know and practice it, then how can diseases occur? Naturally, everyone will be healthy and ascend to longevity. Medicine can only be used as an auxiliary tool. Since the implementation of the health campaign in our city, the summer cholera, although it was very rampant at first, was soon extinguished and did not become a major problem due to effective treatment and thorough prevention, treating both the symptoms and the root cause, and treating both internally and externally. Other measures such as tuberculosis prevention have also been implemented in every detail. Now we will ban spitting everywhere, which is an essential step. As for winter health, the first priority is to widely vaccinate against smallpox. A strong country must first have a strong people. How can there be a nation that does not pay attention to hygiene, is weak and diseased, and still be able to strengthen its country? From now on, morality and intelligence will also be promoted equally through sports. In this way, the three aspects of education will flourish, not only will everyone have a healthy physique, and good birth can be achieved, but also morality and wisdom will flow and advance together. Is it only strengthening the people? The strength of the country can be as sure as holding a ticket. At the beginning of the first winter health campaign conference, I would like to record a few words to express my feelings, and I would like to recite Du Fu's poem "Eight sides open up longevity, one breath turns Hongjun" to be a congratulatory message.</p>
<p>Today is a special issue for the "First Winter Health Campaign Conference in Our City", and Free Talk will be suspended for one day and will be published as usual tomorrow.</p>
