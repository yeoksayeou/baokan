<p>瑞士京城七日哈瓦斯社電　此間政治觀察家頃談稱、此際莫斯科正進行非常重要之談話、討論整個世界之軍事政治、緣自英大使寇爾爵士·美大使史丹萊海軍上將·聯袂自庫壁希夫行抵莫斯科後、美前任駐蘇大使即現任駐土大使史坦因哈特、本日亦巳啟程前往蘇京、至於邱吉爾首相訪蘇之說、觀於最近數日來首相未能到官署辦公、英國十萬工人代表請求政府立即　闢第二戰塲、咋日派遺代表團前往　寗街十號首相官邸請願時、當局藉口未與首相約定時間而拒不延見、凡此種種、均旁證邱吉爾首相殊不在京、此外羅斯福總統派遣空軍將領一員、携帶其私人信件而呈斯達林、並代表美國參加關於擴大美國對蘇援助之談判、此事意義亦甚重大、羅斯福總統特別重視空軍、亦可於此見之、總之華付與倫敦兩方面均深知有迅速與莫斯科保持最密切聯絡之必要、殆可斷言也、</p>
<p>聯軍統帥人選推測</p>
<p>瑞典京城八日海　社電　此間報載倫敦訪員電訊稱、英美蘇三國在莫斯科舉行之會議、爲目前倫敦人士最感興趣之問題、但關於到會之代表以及討論問題之內容、英報迄未刋截詳明之報吿、倫敦官方尙未正式承認邱吉爾首相巳抵莫斯科、瑞典「社會民主報」駐倫敦訪員認爲此次莫斯科談判、具有極重大之意義、英美蘇及其與國之通盤計劃、將提出討諭之、他報訪員推測關於英美蘇各國共同作戰設立統帥以增强作戰效力之問題、亦將提出討論、關於未來統帥之人選問題、美總參謀長馬歇爾將軍之呼聲較低、加拿大海外軍隊總司令麥克腦發中將之呼聲漸高、但關於上述之種種消息、英官方迄無報吿證實之、目前倫敦消息　通人士祗謂莫斯科具有在任何情勢下繼續作戰之決心、此念迄未動搖、</p>
<p>英美駐使離土赴會</p>
<p>土京八日海通社電　此間美國人士證實美駐土大使史坦恩哈特已赴奐斯科、聞將參加現在蘇聯首都進行之談判、英駐土大使許閣森亦巳由土京啓程、所往地似亦為莫斯科、其使命當與史氏柏同、土京政界人士對於英美兩使同時啟程、甚為注意、邱吉爾現在莫斯科之說、由此可見端倪云、</p>
<h3>英全國　劃為十二防區　採分權制應付緊急事變　德在荷挪境作預防措施</h3>
<p>杜白林七日哈瓦斯社電　英國全國現劃分爲十二防衛區、係採用分權制度、如遇外兵犯境發生緊急事變、則區與區之間或將發生阻隔、而各區與倫敦之聯絡亦有斷絕之處、爲應付非常起見、乃設置總監一人、必要時與軍事長官共同組織「地方禦侮委員會」、以維持區內政務、目前各區總監署內、英國政府關係各部均派有代表常川駐在、俾協同總監處理各區事務、據聞此項制度、在承平時代亦將繼續維持、蓋此舉不但可以减輕國會之工作、且可因地制宜、便利各項中央的地方的立法工作云、</p>
<p>瑞典京城七日哈瓦斯社電　頃據挪威京城消息、自瑞典邊境至寇基納斯港整個海岸、巳自八月一日起宣布緊急狀態、惟官方對此尙未正式發表、</p>
<p>瑞士京城七日哈瓦斯社電　報載荷蘭境內德駐軍司令部最近發表一項佈吿、嚴詞警吿荷蘭人民不得協助敵人、企圖在該國海岸登陸、違者處死、同時又令荷蘭全國人民於遇有敵方之航空人員時、得以擊斃之或解交當局處理、且此項措置應於本月十三日以前實行云、</p>

<h3>建設靑年隊舉行　歡迎橫山懇談會　橫山部長發表演詞</h3>
<p>據同盟社訊、中國復興社建設靑年隊隊本部、於前日在虹口某處舉行歡迎日軍報道部長橫山中佐懇談會、當到橫山部長暨該隊沈顧正副兩隊長以下幹部卅餘人、當由橫山部長致詞、沈顧兩隊長亦先發表意見、茲將橫山部長演說辭錄左、</p>
<p>「本人（橫山報道部長自稱）今日初與靑年隊諸君見面、非常榮幸、本人對於反抗英美的戰爭、向諸君有所陳述、中日兩國、本是同種同文、對於人種習慣文化、都是相同、應該大家以眞誠相待、以解除雙方誤會、方可完成全面和平、</p>
<p>日本在初期建國的時候、是非常艱難的、日本人當時亦有腐敗情形、因爲大家覺悟了、遂進行維新運動、澈底革新、而日本漸漸走上强盛之途、但是日本最大目的、在以眞誠建設東亞、希望東亞民族共同携手、建設大東亞共榮圈、</p>
<p>此次大東亞戰爭、乃英美的侵略東亞所造成、並非日本的挑戰、英美武力陰謀、壓迫東亞已久、我人必須起而舊鬥、我們要以眞理武力、根本擊滅英美的東亞勢力、今日乃我人必須奮鬥的時期、本人敢坦白貢獻日本之決心奮鬥、乃欲完成大東亞共榮圈、例如印度是亞洲人種、英國人壓迫備至、現在印度之巳經起而奮鬥了、印度必為共榮圈的一環、</p>
<p>關于共榮圈的希望、我認爲太陽自東而西、在太陽光之下的人羣、應如太陽光一樣有始有終、一致爲共榮圈而奮鬥、使社會發達、人羣幸福、太陽光下有人民、人民應有正義、眞理、共爲人羣之幸福而努力、</p>
<p>我認爲英國爲世界上最惡劣的國家、專在各民族間離間挑撥、使互相爭執而圖漁利、上次歐洲大戰、法德戰爭發生後、聯盟協約二方面國家、都被牽入戰渦、而英國實爲道戰爭的禍首、這許多國家最後都覺悟受人之愚、此次世界大戰、乃由於英國的陰謀、先引起中日事變又引起法德戰爭再引起德蘇戰爭、總之英國企圖、是挑撥各國互相殘殺、又圖漁翁之利、</p>
<p>譬如航運、日本人乘在外人船上、船在中途遇險、論理輪船當局應該保護乘客先行脫險、然後船員逃命、但英美輪船則否、彼等遇險以船員光逃、不顧日本乘客的生命財產、英美人是非常常自私的、祗須自己安全、而不惜犧牲別人的生命、英國自以爲是優等國、而以日本中國爲劣等國、劣等國人是不予優待的、這種情形、使我人不得不怒、所以我們必須予以擊敗、</p>
<p>貴國國父孫先生與頭山滿公、共同爲中日兩邦的親善合作而努力孫先生曾說，欲圖中國的自强　欲求東亞民族的解放、必須與日本携手合作、當時本人亦在日本、時與中國留學生硏究、我人都對於孫頭二公的爲東亞百年大計的精神、一致信服、我們應承繼先知先覺者的精神、努力完成未成立之使命、</p>
<p>孫中山先生本名逸仙、在東京時改名中山、我人今日均知爲中山先生、實在是在日本取名者當日俄戰爭時、孫先生在英國巳提倡大亞洲主義、當時英日尙在同盟時代、英人巳妬忌日本的强大、孫先生先知先覺、巳開始主張大亞細亞主義了、</p>
<p>總之、建設大東亞共榮圈、皆吾人切身之事、找人必定要以眞誠努力增加生產、以增强我們反抗英美的力量、如當氣是使發光的、蒸氣是使發力的、我們必須迎合時代、如造一機器、我們一力面要能夠硏究、一方面要能夠應用、最近越南、我們亦與之協力、有人反對這舉動、但是我們要求東亞各部分之經濟機構相平衡、相流通、英美的貨物不來、我人仍必須設法來源、我人欲使越南中國各方面的經濟相調和、日軍進駐越南後、起初越南各店缺乏貨物、後　貨物漸漸流通、所以安南等地巳澈底明瞭經濟共榮的眞理、最近中國缺少汽油、要求日本補助、故日本的汽油補救了中國汽油的缺乏、如紙頭、一面消耗、一面應有製造辦法所以共榮圈乃使產銷調和、物力入力都有適當之協調、</p>
<p>自大東亞戰爭發生後　因在戰爭進行時、當然不免有戰事之影響、如潛水艇飛機的進襲、靑島和上海等地、均有波及之可能、所以日本現在正努力建設防禦、務求未雨綢繆、有備無息、我們要使東亞共榮圈內的人地如在一關鐵傘之下、人民都能安居樂業、各種建設、同爲共榮圈而配合發展、總之、我人要坦白的相處、眞誠相對、共為共榮圈之完成而努力、我們要求共榮圈的人民一致團結、人力物力都爲共榮圈而集中、本人奉派前來、當盡力犧牲、爲大東亞共榮圈的完成而奮鬥到底、」</p>

<p>兩租界米糧辦事處現鄭重考慮、擬於發售第七期戶口米時（十七日起至二十二日止）、囑令各經售米號兼售碎苞米、但其購買辦法、及准購數量、猶在繼續洽商中、屆時如擬付諸實施、將予會銜佈吿、並於該期起、麵粉或將暫緩撥給、查本市自開始計口授糧後、各米號除發售白米及碎米外、同時並兼售麵粉、每戶每期可購一斤半、故迄今麪粉售出數量、巳甚可觀、茲爲適合配給起見、故擬採取此項措置、</p>

<h3>家庭中的傭婦問題</h3>
<p>— 莉</p>
<p>在一般家庭中，傭婦問題，往往成為主婦們的討論題材，甲家的傭婦懶於做事，乙家的傭婦時常偷東西，丙家的傭婦起身太遲。</p>
<p>然而平心的想一想，傭婦們大都是沒有知識的，她們不知道她們的責任，她們也不明白她們的人生意義，所以一切尚待做主婦的去指導她們。而且，有時候主婦們缺少計劃，也可以說是家事不能順利進行的原因之一，這裹有幾種方法，或者可為主婦們參考：</p>
<p>一切要做的家事，應該有一個計劃，星期一做些什麽，星期二做些什麽，不要臨時更變計劃，弄得手足無措，而使傭婦們怨聲載道。</p>
<p>每天的菜單，要有一點計劃，並在隔夜或淸晨吿訴傭婦，使她們可以做一點準備工作，當然，如果主婦們能够自己担任設計的工作那是最好。</p>
<p>在新用一個傭婦的時候，應該庭中必須遵守的規則逐條吿訴她。</p>
<p>每天起憇的時候，要有規定。</p>
<p>主婦自己的工作，也應該排定，使與傭婦的工作可以相</p>
<p>在傭婦能對她的工作盡責的時候，其他的一切，就可以不必再去顧慮。</p>
<p>選擇傭婦，最重要的三點是誠實，勤奮，健康。</p>
<p>遇到値得獎勵的地方，應該加以獎勵。</p>
<h3>偉大的女性</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>在這個新時代裹，無論男女，都可以受到相等的敎育，因此有很多偉大的成就，是由女子們創造出來的。</p>
<p>對於這一點，我們不難舉幾個例下。</p>
<p>居里夫人，曾和她的丈夫共同發明鐳錠，為醫舉界打開一條新路，世界紅十字會的創造者不是男性，而是克能娜拜登，那瑞典的頓格洛夫是諾貝爾獎金的獲得者，戚爾遜總統的女兒，會幫助她的父親者作醫籍，奧薩莊生，幫助她的丈夫去做探險工作，而共同著成描寫阿非利加洲土人生活的書籍，母親節的創始者是安娜加佛斯，更有一個瑪麗里昂，在美國創辦了第一所女子大學，道些都是偉大的工作、</p>
<p>女子們正有許多事情可以做，在歌頌女性的偉大的時候，希望多產生幾個偉大的女性。</p>
<h3>妯娌之間</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>我們對於一般的家庭，如果作一次仔細的觀察，那麼任何人可看出家庭之中，有許多糾紛，每起於妯娌。所謂妯娌，通常叫做阿嫂弟媳婦。妯娌之問，能夠合得來的果然有，但多數是水火不相容，時常要爭執和口角的。</p>
<p>有時，我們可以看到一個好好的家庭之中，第兄淘裏本來很和睦。但等到娶了妻子以後，因為妯娌間的不和陸，影響到弟兄問的感情。甚至使弟兄之間，也漸漸的因不和而互相岐視，終於形成陌路。骨肉之情，完全沒有了。把一個好好的家庭，弄得三天兩朝有口舌。</p>
<p>我們再進一步，研究到妯娌之間，因何會發生爭執，大概不外因為翁姑對待妯娌，好壞不同，或是要求析產，各組小家庭。女人氣量狹小的居多，多做了一些工作，或是少分到一些財錢，就要表示不平，互相傾軋起來，甚至由暗鬥而明爭，時常口角。</p>
<p>就上文所述，我們可以看到妯娌之間，所以不和，一方面是由翁姑的愛憎或待遇不同而造成，但另一面，在妯娌目己，當然也有着造成糾紛的因素。主要的便是大家懷着自私之心，彼此猜忌嫉妬，到積不相容時，便會發午口舌或是爭執，而影饗到整個家庭　幸福</p>
<p>所以我們為保持家庭的幸福計，希望妯娌之間，能勿起爭執。這一方面常然要希望翁姑對於兒媳，不問多少，要一樣看待；而另一面在妯娌之間，也要不存私見，不懷猜忌，多做一些工作，少分到一些財產，都不在心上，寶行親愛得如同姊妹一樣。至於弟兄之間，也當有些男子氣，枕頭邊的閒話是不好聽的。妻子在說兄嫂或弟婦的壞話，非但不能聽信，而且要加以解說勸導。</p>
<p>如果能夠這樣，妯娌之間，就終年和好，不會發生口舌，而結果家庭的糾紛和煩惱，至少一部分可以免除。換句話說，家庭中的幸福，因為妯娌的和睦，也可得以保持或增進了。</p>
<h3>飯的補充品</h3>
<p>— 天一</p>
<p>天下何如吃飯難。尤其是現在的上海。因此，在這「米貴如珠」的時候，就得另想方法了。下面就是補救缺米的法子。</p>
<p>綠荳粥：在這暑天，早晚吃涼冷的綠荳粥，淸爽適口。</p>
<p>赤荳飯：先將赤荳和水放鍋中燒熱，然後把米加入，一待飯米煮熟，即呈紅色，美觀無比，而且吃時淸香可口。</p>
<p>菜飯洋芋艿、燒菜飯時，放些洋芋艿，滲入同食，風味更佳</p>
<p>以上三樣方法，不過略舉其例，這樣不但解決了「缺米」的吃飯問題，並且，綠荳，赤荳，洋竿艿價錢也較白米為廉。如果，時常輪流和更換花式，還可調和胃口。</p>
<p>家庭信箱</p>
<p>主筆先生、怨我不說客　的話，我現在也有一個難題，請先生指教。</p>
<p>我自從去年認識了一位男朋友，他忠實可靠，且有上等的學問，高尚的職業，及上進的志向，品性又好，態度亦大方，眞使我甚為愛慕他，我與他的情投意合，也可以說已是列入決定的階段了。不料最近我的雙親隱約約的私自在於我與另一　子訂婚，迄我知之，事已定，我即從中反對，不滿意這不自由的婚姻，雖然對方是相當的有錢的，但是不中意那不務正業的紈袴子，我常對雙親表示，「富有百萬財產，不如一技在身」，但總不能博得雙親同意，甚至有時還招責駡。請問先生何種良策解決之，使我得到自由天地，切盼！切盼！專此　頌撰安，望教者石秀英謹上八月六日。</p>
<p>秀英女士、我們以為婚姻構成的必要條件，是感情的，法律的，缺一不可。你不　於父母所締的富家之弟不務正業者的婚約，如果你已屆法定年齡，這是你有自主體的：可是只知法律，不顧家庭感悄，我們不敢茍同。至於你所心許的男友，婚姻問題，現在似乎只好暫勿加以考慮，因為在你的已訂婚約未解除以前，這種懷念，徒然加重你人生旅途中的痛苦。你應該充　知識，致力學業，始能建築你現代婚姻的基礎，得到自由的天地。順便，我們還要以十二分的誠意，向女士的發親忠吿，萬萬不要企慕一時的虛榮，犧牲了你們可愛的子女的終身章　。今日家庭中的悲劇，由於做父母的沒有經過遭樣合理的考慮而　成的。眞不知有多少，希望女士的變親，注意遺一點！　（編者）</p>
<h3>淸凉散一服</h3>
<p>— 覺</p>
<p>黃菜葉，用鹽炒，只撐得肚皮飽；若因滋味食饕餮，從此俯仰多煩惱？</p>
<p>破衲頭，無價寶，補上加補年年好；盈箱　籠替人藏，何曾件件穿到老！</p>
<p>硬木床，舖軟草，高枕無憂酣　了；錦衾繡褥不成眠，翻來覆去天已曉！</p>
<p>舊房屋，只要掃，及時修理　不倒；近來多少好樓臺，半成瓦礫生靑草！</p>
<p>席間欣賞友人所持之扇，得讀有文，回誦數遍，覺此中非特對於人生覜有極透澈之指示，且對現下家庭針砭至為確切，不啻溽暑服一劑淸涼散，深望讀者細細玩味之。</p>

<h3>U.S. Planes (Five) Attack Guangzhou; Air Battle Occurs; Two Shot Down by Japanese Planes at Sanshui; Japanese Planes Simultaneously Raid Various Places in Hunan and Guangdong</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 8th (Special Dispatch from the Allied News Agency) – The Southern China Japanese Military Headquarters disclosed this afternoon that five U.S. bombers, escorted by several fighter planes, attempted to attack the Guangzhou airfield at 8:10 AM today. They were repelled by the Japanese Army Air Force. Two U.S. planes were shot down at Sanshui, 50 kilometers west of Guangzhou. The U.S. air force then dropped bombs near the outskirts of Longtan, resulting in over 20 Chinese casualties.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 8th (Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency) – According to a report from Chongqing, large formations of Japanese planes attacked U.S.-China air force bases in Hunan and Guangdong in separate batches on the morning of the 7th. One squadron flew to Xiangyin Yangtze River, another to Xiangtan Hengshan, and another to Shaoguan Pingshi and other places, inflicting heavy damage on military facilities in various locations.</p>
<p>Jinhua, 8th (Special Dispatch from the Allied News Agency) – The Japanese army fought near Fangshan Ridge, south of Songyang. An investigation on the 6th revealed the following captured war booty: one mortar, two light mortars, seven Czech machine guns, seventeen Maxim guns, fifty-one 50kg bombs. Furthermore, a military depot was discovered in the Fangshan Ridge mountains, and ten mortars, twenty-five Maxim machine guns, and six Czech guns were seized.</p>
<h3>War News from Jiangxi Province</h3>
<p>Hankou, 8th (Special Dispatch from the Allied News Agency) – Japanese troops in Jiangxi province launched a three-pronged attack early Wednesday morning. By last night, they had occupied Lixu, 20 kilometers east of Linchuan. The defending troops were approximately 10,000 soldiers from the 19th Division of the 70th Army, led by General Hai Boyin. It is believed that the Japanese army intends to push into the interior, hence the relocation of their headquarters to Lixu. However, on Thursday, the Japanese army launched a surprise attack on the front lines of the defending forces from the northeast, north, and west, and are currently advancing rapidly southeast.</p>
<h3>Indian Congress Party Executive Committee Passes Resolution Guaranteeing Independence; Sends Letters to Roosevelt and Chiang Kai-shek Requesting Guarantee of Indian Independence</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 7th (Special Dispatch from the Allied News Agency) – According to a report from Bombay, the Executive Committee of the Congress Party, regarding Speaker Acharya's request to send separate appeals to Roosevelt, Chiang Kai-shek, and Soviet Ambassador to the UK, Maisky, requesting a guarantee of immediate Indian independence, passed a resolution on the morning of the 7th. It is reported that Acharya intends to send personal letters regarding the resolution and will seek endorsement from the All-India Congress on the 8th. Furthermore, the content of the letters requests that the United Nations take appropriate measures. According to Acharya, the Executive Committee has already resolved to allow him to send the resolution separately to Roosevelt, Chiang Kai-shek, and Soviet Ambassador to the UK, Maisky. Once passed by the All-India Congress on the 8th, written notifications will be sent separately.</p>
<p>Gandhi's Speech on Determination to Fight</p>
<p>Lisbon, 7th (Special Dispatch from the Allied News Agency) – During the All-India Congress meeting on the 7th, Gandhi, amidst unanimous and enthusiastic cheers, took the stage and delivered a speech that lasted for forty minutes without showing any fatigue. The gist of his speech stated that British forces must immediately withdraw from India, or India will launch a non-violent disobedience movement. This struggle against Britain is the greatest in his life, and he would rather fast to death if it is not achieved. He hopes this will be recognized by the Congress. He has always been a friend of Britain, and their current suffering only strengthens his friendship with them. It is precisely because of this friendship that he wishes to point out their errors, but they do not understand this at all. The Congress Party authorities have already approved that the members will obey his instructions. His determination to fight for Indian independence has not diminished in the slightest since 1920; instead, it has grown even stronger. The responsibility of discussing the Executive Committee's resolution is extremely heavy and great. Any decision made by the members will significantly affect the actions of all Indian people. Therefore, if any members oppose the resolution, they must frankly express their opinions. Once a decision is made, the members must devote their full efforts, without any reservations, and resolutely implement it. Furthermore, the representatives of the National Congress Party include Hindus, Muslims, Zoroastrians, etc. Yet, today, Jinnah, the president of the Muslim League, still opposes us. Since our struggle is for freedom, why would Jinnah need to work for the independence movement of the Muslims if the struggle is eliminated? Therefore, we cannot but offer our sincere advice to Mr. Jinnah.</p>
<p>U.S. Denies Taking on Mediation</p>
<p>Lisbon, 7th (Special Dispatch from the Allied News Agency) – U.S. White House authorities have denied reports that the U.S. will mediate the direct conflict between Britain and India. However, a Washington radio station reporter stated on the 7th that Roosevelt might seek a suitable solution with Gandhi. At the same time, synthesizing the opinions of general India experts in Washington, it is difficult to predict how the situation will evolve if India launches a disobedience movement. In any case, Gandhi's claims will further escalate the situation, which is very unfavorable to the position of the United Nations.</p>
<p>Quick Sketch of the All-India Congress Venue</p>
<p>Stockholm, 8th (Special Dispatch from the Reuter Tong News Agency) – The All-India Congress Committee proceeded in Bombay yesterday according to the established procedures. Behind-the-scenes negotiations were ineffective. Construction of the great auditorium for the committee meeting was still underway on the eve of the event. Three thousand seats were added so that ten thousand people could attend the opening ceremony. Half an hour before the meeting, tickets sold for 26 pounds each. Order at the venue was maintained by three thousand young members of the party, wearing homespun Indian linen shirts. Gandhi sat among the fifteen members of the Executive Committee, on a backless chair with an embroidered cushion. Gandhi's spinning wheel was also brought. The wooden pillars supporting the roof were painted green, white, and tan. Large porcelain containers for storing water were placed throughout the venue, along with 200 large electric fans to dispel the heat. At the entrance, there was a long row of telephones for use by the press. Loudspeakers were installed outside the hall so that the large crowd outside could be informed of the proceedings inside the venue. Vendors gathered at the entrance to the venue.</p>
<p>Indian Governor-General Forbids Shops from Closing</p>
<p>Lisbon, 7th (Special Dispatch from the Allied News Agency) – According to a report from New Delhi, in view of the fact that the National Congress Party All-India Congress is certain to pass the proposal demanding the withdrawal of British forces from India, and also anticipating the imminent launch of a disobedience movement, the Governor-General of India issued an order on the 6th as a preemptive measure, forbidding shops selling essential goods from closing down without authorization.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 8th (Special Dispatch from the Reuter Tong News Agency) – According to news from Melbourne relayed from London, it is evident that Australia has once again issued a call for assistance.

<p>Washington, 7th (Special Dispatch from Havas) – The government is making every effort to collect scrap metal. War Production Board Chairman Nelson gave a speech to the press today, urging the nation to donate scrap iron and all non-essential metal products. He stated, in essence, that if we wish to maintain the current production rate until the end of this year, we will need 17 million tons of scrap steel. At the same time, President Roosevelt supported Nelson at today's press conference, stating, in essence, that all discarded metal products must be delivered to factories. Old cars, agricultural machinery, copper products, and old rubber, etc., must all be collected.</p>
<h3>U.S. Airborne Division Established; Will Be Sent to Europe to Fight</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 8th (Special Dispatch from the Reuter Tong News Agency) – A Washington dispatch states that Under Secretary of War Patterson announced yesterday that the United States has formed two airborne divisions, each with 8,000 personnel, all paratroopers and soldiers carrying gliders. These divisions will be sent to Europe to fight, and more such divisions will be formed in the future.</p>
<h3>German Army Braving Scorching Heat; Continues to Advance Deep into the Caucasus; Maikop Oil Region Threatened; Fierce Fighting Underway in Don River Bend</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Special Dispatch from the Allied News Agency) – It was announced today that the German army, having invaded the western Caucasus, yesterday breached the Soviet tank trap positions 17 miles north of Krasnodar (the capital of the Kuban region). German mobile units advanced from the Kuban River bridgehead and reached the Laba River.</p>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Special Dispatch from Havas) – The Supreme Command announced earlier that yesterday the German army continued to attack enemy forces and has reached 20 miles north and northeast of Krasnodar. A breach has been made in the enemy's tank defense line, and the vanguard of the German army has reached the Laba River. The cities of Armavir and Kurgannaya have been occupied by our forces after fierce fighting. German aircraft have been very effective in covering the armored units and bombing the enemy's forward units. The German-Romanian allied forces are fighting under the scorching sun and encountering determined resistance from the Red Army. They have gained a foothold on the north bank of the Sal River and destroyed 23 enemy tanks. In the Don River bend, the German army has also launched an offensive north of Kalach. In the area northwest of Moscow, in Rayevo, the German defensive battles have spread elsewhere. Counterattacks by Soviet troops in several locations have been repelled. Fifty-four Soviet tanks have been destroyed in two days. In the Leningrad area, Soviet troops launched several attacks, and hand-to-hand combat occurred, but the offensives were also repelled.</p>
<p>Moscow, 8th (Special Dispatch from the Allied News Agency) – The Soviet Information Bureau's midnight war bulletin stated that yesterday our forces were still engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy north of Kletskaya, Kotelnikovo, Armavir, and Koshekhabl, with little change in other areas. It also stated that, three days after the major tank battle, the German army has cut off the Krasnodar-Stalingrad railway in Kotelnikovo. This location is approximately 100 miles southwest of Stalingrad and 50 miles east of Tsimlyansk. Furthermore, the German army's fierce offensive in the Caucasus has not weakened at all.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 8th (Special Dispatch from Havas) – Unless there are unexpected changes in the southern Soviet battlefield, the Maikop oil fields may be occupied by the German army within 12 or 24 hours. Yesterday, after the German army occupied Armavir, it crossed Lapinskaya, which is only about 30 miles from Maikop. If the German army advances at its current speed, the 30-mile distance can be reached in a few hours. The situation in Krasnodar is similar. The German army yesterday advanced past Timoshevskaya, which is about 35 miles north of Krasnodar. After Maikop and Krasnodar fall, the German army seems likely to head straight for the two ports of Tuapse and Novorossiysk on the Black Sea coast. If those two ports fall, the Soviet Black Sea Fleet will lose its reliance and will have to flee to the only remaining port of Batumi.</p>
<p>Near the Soviet Border, 7th (Special Dispatch from Havas) – On the 411th day of the German-Soviet war, the German army is advancing south along the Rostov-Grozny-Baku railway at a breakneck pace. In the height of summer, with the scorching sun high in the sky and temperatures reaching 100 degrees Fahrenheit, the German army is still advancing an average of 40 miles per day. The Red Army withdrew from Armavir today, and the city is engulfed in flames. A large number of Red Army troops have been surrounded north of Voroshilovgrad. Tikhoretsk has now been completely occupied. The Red Army has repeatedly launched concentrated counterattacks using cavalry in the area around the city and in several places in the Kuban region. The streets of Tikhoretsk are littered with the bodies of Caucasian cavalrymen and horses. The front line in the Kuban region now runs southwest from the Lisk-Armavir railway, parallel to the railway. The German army is adopting a strategy of central breakthrough at each of these positions to advance towards Maikop and Krasnodar. However, it is believed that the rugged terrain has slowed the German advance. It is likely that the German army will simultaneously attack the four cities of Pyatigorsk, Mineralnye Vody, Krasnodar, and Maikop. The fall of each of these cities is only a matter of time. The terrain in which the Red Army is positioned near Krasnodar and Maikop is extremely unfavorable, and it seems they will have to retreat along the Novorossiysk and Tuapse routes. Therefore, this Red Army has been separated from the main force in the south, and if its defensive area falls again, the consequences will be disastrous, especially the concern that the Soviet Black Sea Fleet will lose its last base. Moreover, once Maikop is occupied, the German army can transfer the troops under General von Manstein, currently in the Crimea, to the front lines without worrying about its rear. Southeast of Voroshilovgrad, the German army is advancing steadily towards the Kuma River. The terrain in this area is extremely flat, and it is possible that the German army will continue its advance at its current pace, or even increase its pace. The German army attaches great importance to the offensive in this area, as occupying the Kuma River would allow them to control the Armavir-Baku railway. In addition, fighting continues between the Sal River and the Don River. It is reported that the German-Romanian allied forces have broken through the Red Army's positions near Kotelnikovo, 60 miles southwest of Stalingrad. The Red Army north of the Don River bend was forced to cross the river, abandoning its bridgehead near Serafimovich. However, a large number of fresh troops have arrived, and several regiments of heavy tanks have also arrived southwest of Stalingrad in preparation for a major battle. The German air force has been extremely active in recent days, bombing the railway lines to Moscow and Stalingrad without reservation. According to aircraft reconnaissance reports, the railway is very busy, suggesting that a large army is being sent to Stalingrad to reinforce it.</p>
<p>German Shock Troops Cross the Desert to Attack Astrakhan</p>
<p>Near the Border of Ukraine, 7th (Special Dispatch from Havas) – It has just been learned that the German High Command has dispatched an army, via the Kalmyk Desert, to advance on Astrakhan. After breaking through the Red Army's defenses, the German army has advanced 100 miles to the southeast, and its vanguard is only 130 miles from Astrakhan. As for the most notable developments in other areas, these are the successive fall of Armavir and Eisk, and the interruption of the Moscow-Stalingrad railway. At present, the main force of the German army is continuing to advance between the Don and Sal Rivers. Although the details are unknown, the general situation shows that the Axis forces have a clear advantage. In the Caucasus, the German army is also advancing rapidly. Last night, it was only 15 miles from Pyatigorsk, and the German right flank had reached Timoshevskaya (40 miles north of Krasnodar). Another armored unit is also advancing towards the Krasnodar oil field, apparently intending to seize Georgievsk. To the west, the German army crossed the Kuban River yesterday and continued to advance westward. In addition, a large armored unit is currently advancing towards Maikop, and German reconnaissance units have reached the outskirts of the city, although this has not yet been confirmed. Between the Sea of Azov and the Rostov-Armavir railway, the Axis forces made further progress yesterday, continuing to advance along the north bank of the Kuban River. Another unit is advancing towards the Black Sea, its objective being to capture Krasnodar. The Red Army is currently setting up defenses in the area to continue its resistance.</p>
<h3>Stalin's Secret Military Order: Defending Troops Must Not Retreat</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Special Dispatch from the Reuter Tong News Agency) – During recent fighting by the German army in the Don and Caucasus regions, a secret military order No. 227, signed by Stalin, was intercepted, dated July 28, 1942. The order stipulated that Soviet troops must not retreat without explicit orders from the Soviet military command, and those who violate the order would be severely punished without leniency. A representative of the German High Command today read this military order to foreign journalists in Berlin, exposing the inner workings of the Soviet army.</p>
<h3>High Alert on Turkey's Eastern Border; Sudden Closure of the Turkish-Syrian Border</h3>
<p>Ankara, 8th (Special Dispatch from the Reuter Tong News Agency) – Well-informed sources here say that the Turkish authorities are continuing to make all necessary preparations in the ports along the Black Sea so that Soviet warships can be detained if they try to escape there. However, political circles generally still believe that the Soviets will scuttle their ships themselves after losing their last seaports. At the same time, the defense forces of Turkey's eastern provinces have been reinforced, and precautionary measures have been taken along the border. Any Soviet soldiers who cross the border to escape will be detained.</p>
<p>Turkish Capital, 7th (Special Dispatch from Havas) – According to reliable sources here, the border between Turkey and Syria has been closed, for reasons unknown.</p>
<h3>Germany Stockpiles Grain and Stores Food to Prepare for Winter</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Special Dispatch from the Reuter Tong News Agency) – To prepare for an early winter this year, Germany is advising farmers to harvest potatoes in July to the extent possible. The summer weather in Europe has not been very hot, and the first frost may come earlier than in previous years. It seems that precautions should be taken now.</p>
<h3>British and German Forces in North Africa Actively Reinforcing</h3>
<p>Near the Egyptian Border, 7th (Special Dispatch from Havas) – In recent days, there has been no change in the positions of the belligerent parties along the Egyptian front, from the Mediterranean coast to the Qattara Depression. However, the air forces of both sides have been as active as ever. According to British sources, British aircraft have bombed the port of Derna and Axis communication lines. Both sides are using the lull in the fighting to strengthen their positions. It is reported that General Auchinleck has transferred a large number of reinforcements, and his stockpiles of food and ammunition have also increased. In addition, large tanks have been transferred from Sudan to the front lines. Generals Rommel and Kesselring have also transferred a large number of German troops from Crete, most of whom have been transported to the port of Tobruk by air or sea. British aircraft are constantly bombing this port for this reason. Generals Rommel and Kesselring have also transferred a large number of tanks, and the number of armored units has reached at least two divisions. In addition, the 164th Division, a crack unit, is currently being reorganized in Egypt, incorporating fresh troops transferred from Greece. The Italian armored units have also been reinforced. A large number of artillery pieces have been transferred from Italy, and many trucks are seen heading to the front lines every day.</p>
<p>Rome, 8th (Special Dispatch from the Reuter Tong News Agency) – The Italian High Command announced this afternoon that British aircraft attempted to attack our military positions on the Egyptian front and thirteen were shot down by German aircraft. In addition, two enemy aircraft were shot down by anti-aircraft guns, and two enemy airmen were captured. Our aircraft bombed the enemy's supply centers, with considerable success.</p>

<h3>British and American Expansion of Aid to the Soviet Union: Moscow Conference; Military and Political Matters Included in Discussions; Churchill-Stalin Meeting Confirmed</h3>
<p>Lisbon, August 8th, Associated Press: According to reliable sources in Washington, a conference is being held in Moscow with the aim of finding ways to aid the Soviet Union. Participants include U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Admiral Standley; U.S. Air Force Commander, Major General Brereton; British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Kerr; and French representative to the Soviet Union, Garreau.</p>
<p>Ankara, August 8th, Huitong News Agency: A telegram from Kuibyshev confirms the reports from London that Churchill has flown to Moscow. The Churchill-Stalin meeting is said to be definitely confirmed.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, August 7th, Havas: British Prime Minister Churchill's whereabouts are now the subject of much speculation in European capitals. According to the Geneva Tribune, diplomatic talks are being conducted in Moscow between Roosevelt's representative Brereton and British Ambassador Kerr and the Soviet side. The British side considers this to be extremely important. Although Soviet officials claim it is a discussion of routine matters, it is generally believed that this meeting is nothing more than a discussion of active methods to aid the Soviet Union, roughly including the following four points: 1. Opening a second battlefield in Western Europe; 2. Implementing large-scale air raids on Germany; 3. Increasing the supply of military needs to the Soviet Union; 4. Sending British and American troops to reinforce the Eastern Front. It is heard that the British side generally believes that action must be taken now no matter what, so as to prevent the situation from worsening. It is better to accept all dangers and immediately open a second battlefield than to fight the entire German army in the future.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, August 7th, Havas: Political observers here recently stated that very important talks are currently underway in Moscow, discussing the entire world's military and political situation. After British Ambassador Sir Kerr and U.S. Ambassador Admiral Standley arrived in Moscow from Kuibyshev together, former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union and current Ambassador to Turkey, Steinhardt, also departed for the Soviet capital today. As for the talk of Prime Minister Churchill visiting the Soviet Union, judging from the fact that the Prime Minister has been unable to attend to official duties in recent days, and the fact that representatives of 100,000 British workers were dispatched yesterday to No. 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister's residence, to petition the government to immediately open a second battlefield, but the authorities refused to receive them on the grounds that no appointment had been made with the Prime Minister, all these factors indirectly prove that Prime Minister Churchill is indeed not in the capital. In addition, President Roosevelt's dispatch of an air force general carrying his personal letter to Stalin, and representing the United States in negotiations regarding expanding American aid to the Soviet Union, is also of great significance. President Roosevelt's particular emphasis on the air force can also be seen from this. In short, both Washington and London are deeply aware of the need to maintain the closest contact with Moscow as quickly as possible, which can almost be asserted.</p>
<p>Speculation About the Allied Commander-in-Chief</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, August 8th, Huitong News Agency: Local newspapers report that dispatches from London state that the conference held in Moscow between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is the issue of greatest interest to people in London at present. However, British newspapers have not yet published detailed reports regarding the representatives attending the meeting and the content of the discussions. London officials have not yet formally acknowledged that Prime Minister Churchill has arrived in Moscow. The London correspondent of the Swedish "Social Democratic Newspaper" believes that this Moscow negotiation has extremely important significance, and the overall plans of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and its allies will be put forward for discussion. Correspondents from other newspapers speculate that the issue of establishing a commander-in-chief for Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to jointly fight in order to enhance combat effectiveness will also be raised for discussion. Regarding the selection of the future commander-in-chief, the voice of U.S. Chief of Staff General Marshall is relatively low, and the voice of Lieutenant General McNaughton, Commander-in-Chief of the Canadian Overseas Forces, is gradually increasing. However, regarding the above-mentioned news, British officials have not yet confirmed any reports. Currently, informed sources in London only say that Moscow has the determination to continue fighting under any circumstances, and this idea has not wavered.</p>
<p>British and American Ambassadors Leave Turkey for the Meeting</p>
<p>Istanbul, August 8th, Huitong News Agency: American sources here confirm that U.S. Ambassador to Turkey, Steinhardt, has departed for Moscow, and it is heard that he will participate in the negotiations currently underway in the Soviet capital. British Ambassador to Turkey, Knatchbull-Hugessen, has also departed from Istanbul, and his destination seems to also be Moscow. His mission is likely the same as Steinhardt's. Political figures in Istanbul are paying close attention to the simultaneous departure of the British and American ambassadors. The report that Churchill is currently in Moscow can be seen from this.</p>
<h3>Britain Divided into Twelve Defense Zones: Decentralized System to Cope with Emergencies; Germany Takes Preventive Measures in the Netherlands and Norway</h3>
<p>Dublin, August 7th, Havas: Britain has now been divided into twelve defense zones, adopting a decentralized system. In the event of a foreign invasion or emergency, there may be blockades between zones, and communications between each zone and London may also be cut off. To cope with emergencies, a commissioner is appointed, who, when necessary, will jointly organize a "Local Defense Committee" with military officers to maintain local government affairs. Currently, representatives from various British government departments are stationed permanently in the commissioner's office of each zone to assist the commissioner in handling affairs in each zone. It is heard that this system will continue to be maintained even in peacetime, as this measure can not only reduce the work of Parliament but also tailor measures to local conditions, facilitating various central and local legislative works.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, August 7th, Havas: According to news from the capital of Norway, the entire coast from the Swedish border to the port of Kirkenes has been declared a state of emergency since August 1st, but officials have not yet formally announced this.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, August 7th, Havas: Reports state that the German occupation headquarters in the Netherlands recently issued a proclamation, sternly warning the Dutch people not to assist the enemy attempting to land on the country's coast, or they will be executed. At the same time, it also ordered the people of the Netherlands to kill or hand over to the authorities any enemy airmen encountered, and that this measure should be implemented before the 13th of this month.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, August 7th, Havas: According to news from Norway, the Norwegian Central Police Bureau is currently undergoing a thorough reorganization, with several senior police officers either being dismissed or demoted and transferred to local police stations.</p>

<h3>Atmospheric Pressure Remains Extremely High and Dry: Epidemic Spreads More Severely; More Than 1,600 Epidemic Cases This Summer; Passengers Must Get Off Trams at Bridge and Be Inspected</h3>
<p>The high heat has not subsided slightly, and the highest temperature is still above 100 degrees. The summer heat is truly frightening. According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency yesterday, the highest temperature recorded by the Observatory yesterday was still 102.4 degrees Fahrenheit (39.1 degrees Celsius). The sun's rays blazed all day, and the umbrella market was bustling. However, the wind was slightly stronger, and the observed atmospheric pressure remained extremely high and dry.</p>
<p>Number of Injections</p>
<p>The number of citizens in the two concessions receiving epidemic prevention injections from the health departments is increasing daily. On the 7th alone, the total number of people injected by the health departments of the two concessions reached 66,052, including 35,052 in the International Settlement and 27,000 in the French Concession. It is heard that the International Settlement health authorities received reports of six suspected cholera cases and four deaths on the 7th, while the French Concession had fourteen suspected cholera cases and four deaths. By Wednesday, a total of 53,756 people had been injected, and on Thursday, a total of 58,786 people had been injected.</p>
<p>Epidemic Situation</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Times" reported yesterday that the total number of cholera cases found in the city, as of Thursday evening, has reached 1,617, about twice the 813 cases for the entire summer of last year, and 258 of them have already died. According to the explanation of the health department authorities, the large number of cholera cases can be divided into two types: one is the confirmed cases, and the other is the unconfirmed cases. All patients who believe they have contracted cholera and seek treatment from hospitals, but have not been proven, are classified into the second category. However, there are often deaths in this second category of patients, so that the doctors cannot confirm whether the cause of death is due to cholera. So far, the French Concession has received reports of 339 cases of infection, with 42 deaths, of which 137 cases have not been confirmed as genuine cholera. The International Settlement has discovered 233 cholera cases, with 49 deaths. As for those infected in the Chinese areas, it has reached more than 1,000 people.</p>
<p>Passenger Inspection</p>
<p>In the International Settlement, in order to prevent the spread of the cholera epidemic, special personnel have been sent to check epidemic prevention equipment on trams on all routes since the previous day. At the same time, when trolleybuses on Routes 18 and 14, and trams on Routes 1, 12, and 5 pass through various bridges, passengers must get off the bus and walk, and are only allowed to re-board the bus after presenting their epidemic prevention certificates.</p>
<p>Hongkou Quarantine</p>
<p>The inspection of epidemic prevention certificates is extremely strict in Hongkou. The person in charge is the Japanese Naval Landing Force. At the Waihong Bridge, Zhonghong Bridge, and Lihong Bridge, there are one or two squads of soldiers stationed at each bridge entrance. All passengers on trams, cars, and rickshaws who are allowed to pass must get off the vehicle and present their epidemic prevention certificates. Those without certificates or with expired certificates will be forcibly injected by the mobile injection team stationed on the bridge before being allowed to pass. Due to the recent prevalence of cholera in the Nanshi area, a large-scale disinfection of wells within the boundary has been started since yesterday. An appropriate amount of disinfectant is added to the well depending on its size, and it is stipulated that people are only allowed to take drinks two hours after disinfection.</p>
<h3>Shenbao Scholarship Fund: Donations Continue Uninterrupted; Schools Will Open Soon; Funds Will Be Issued in Accordance with Regulations</h3>
<p>The "Shenbao" scholarship fund has received enthusiastic donations from all sectors. With the opening of schools approaching, the scholarship funds will be examined and issued in accordance with the prescribed procedures. Donors continue to donate generously. Yesterday, we received 500 yuan from Mo Zhi, 100 yuan from Tao Shouji, 10 yuan from an anonymous person (receipt number 1526), 15 yuan from a regular customer (manuscript fee), and 10 yuan from Liu Zufa, totaling 645 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates. The previous balance was 167,612 yuan, 8 jiao, and 2 fen. The total balance is 168,257 yuan, 8 jiao, and 2 fen.</p>
<h3>Netherlands Bank Continues to Return Deposits</h3>
<p>According to the Allied Press, the Japanese authorities announced on the 8th that the Netherlands Bank, which is being liquidated as an enemy bank, has decided to continue holding the fourth return of deposits, with a ratio of 15% of the remaining amount of general deposits after the first return. The method is as follows: 1. The return ratio is 15% of the remaining amount of general deposits after the first return. 2. The cumulative return ratio of deposits is 85%. 3. The return date is August 10th.</p>
<h3>Extortion and Robbery: Miscreants Undeterred by Law; Caught Again</h3>
<p>Yanghuo stores such as the Rich-New-Rising, Rixin Sheng, the Kai Zi Er Lu Hengfeng on the Avenue Edward VII have received threatening letters demanding millions of dollars since April of last year. After receiving a report from the French Concession Police, they successively arrested the bandits Zhou Zhengming (25 years old, from Haiyan) and local residents Li Kaiming (19 years old), Li Hongkui (25 years old), Cai Ming (35 years old), etc. and brought them to the French court for trial, sentencing them to nine months in prison each. They were released from prison in early March of this year. However, Zhou and others remained incorrigible.</p>
<p>And Plot Revenge</p>
<p>They even sent letters to the above-mentioned foreign goods stores demanding to borrow huge sums of money, otherwise they would definitely deal with them by drastic measures. The end of the letter was signed "Gang Zi." The stores ignored the letters after receiving them. Zhou and others then made phone calls urging payment, but the stores still ignored them. Until the month of Jiao, Zhou Zhengming colluded with Li Kaiming and the fugitives Wu Ruisheng and Fang Bingyou to rob the Wang family, owner of the Dingsheng store at No. 419 Zhonghui Building, of clothing and ornaments worth</p>
<p>More Than 1,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Later, the father robbed a machine factory on Malang Road of huge sums of money. After each of the victims reported the case to the police and requested an arrest, Inspector Qin Youyu, Detective Dai Rongji, and Detective Chen Fusheng of the Chinese Detective Bureau first arrested the bandits Li Hongkui and Cai Ming on Wangzhi Road, who confessed that Zhou Zhengming and Li Kaiming were hiding in the Huxi Hotel in Caojiadu, Huxi. They raided the hotel together with the local Japanese and Chinese military police on the previous day, arrested the two bandits Zhou and Li, and found two pistols under the bed. They were taken to the police station. After interrogation, they confessed to robbery without denying it. The police chief ordered them to be detained and investigated according to law.</p>
<h3>Business Community Fetes Japanese Press Delegation: Wu Yun Zhai Delivers Welcome Speech</h3>

<h3>Construction Youth Corps Holds Welcome Meeting with Yokoyama: Minister Yokoyama Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>According to the Allied Press, the headquarters of the China Revival Society's Construction Youth Corps held a meeting with Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama, Chief of the Reporting Department of the Japanese Army, at a certain location in Hongkou on the previous day. Minister Yokoyama and more than 30 cadres, including the two chiefs of the team, Shen and Gu Zhengfu, were present. Minister Yokoyama delivered a speech, and the two chiefs, Shen and Gu, also expressed their opinions first. The text of Minister Yokoyama's speech is recorded on the left:</p>
<p>"I (Yokoyama, Chief of the Reporting Department, refers to himself) am very honored to meet with the members of the Youth Corps for the first time today. I have something to tell you about the war against Britain and the United States. China and Japan are of the same race and the same writing. Their races, habits, and cultures are the same. Everyone should treat each other with sincerity in order to dispel misunderstandings and complete overall peace.</p>
<p>Japan was very difficult in the early days of its founding. There was also corruption among the Japanese people at that time. Because everyone was aware of it, they carried out the Restoration Movement and thoroughly reformed, and Japan gradually embarked on the road to strength. However, Japan's greatest goal is to sincerely build East Asia. It is hoped that the people of East Asia will join hands to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
<p>This Greater East Asia War was caused by the invasion of East Asia by Britain and the United States, not by Japan's challenge. The Anglo-American military conspiracy has been oppressing East Asia for a long time, and we must rise up and fight. We must fundamentally destroy the Anglo-American forces in East Asia with truth and military force. Today is the time when we must strive. I dare to frankly contribute Japan's determination to strive, which is to complete the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. For example, India is of the Asian race, and the British have oppressed it to the extreme. Now India has already risen up to fight. India must be a link in the Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
<p>Regarding the hope of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, I believe that the sun rises from the east and sets in the west. The people under the sunlight should have a beginning and an end like the sunlight, and strive together for the Co-Prosperity Sphere, so that society can develop and the people can be happy. There are people under the sunlight, and the people should have justice and truth, and work together for the happiness of the people.</p>
<p>I believe that Britain is the worst country in the world. It specializes in alienating and instigating conflicts between various ethnic groups, causing them to fight each other and seek profit. After the outbreak of the Franco-German War in the last European War, the countries on both sides of the Alliance and the Entente were involved in the war, and Britain was the culprit of the war. In the end, many countries realized that they had been fooled. This World War was due to Britain's conspiracy, which first triggered the Sino-Japanese Incident, then triggered the Franco-German War, and then triggered the German-Soviet War. In short, Britain's attempt was to instigate various countries to kill each other, and then seek the fisherman's profit.</p>
<p>For example, in shipping, if a Japanese person is on a foreigner's ship and the ship encounters danger in the middle of the journey, it is logical that the shipping authorities should protect the passengers and allow them to escape first, and then the crew should escape. But Anglo-American ships are not like that. When they encounter danger, they only allow the crew to escape, regardless of the lives and property of the Japanese passengers. Anglo-Americans are very selfish. They only need their own safety and do not hesitate to sacrifice the lives of others. Britain considers itself to be a superior country, and considers Japan and China to be inferior countries. People in inferior countries are not given preferential treatment. This situation makes us have to be angry, so we must defeat them.</p>
<p>Your country's founding father, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and Mr. Toyama Mitsuru, worked together for the friendship and cooperation between China and Japan. Mr. Sun once said that if we want to strengthen China and liberate the East Asian peoples, we must work hand in hand with Japan. I was also in Japan at the time, and I studied with Chinese students. We all admired the spirit of Mr. Sun and Mr. Tou for their long-term plan for East Asia, and we agreed that we should inherit the spirit of the sages and work hard to complete the unfulfilled mission.</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen's original name was Yixian, and he changed his name to Zhongshan in Tokyo. Today, we all know him as Mr. Zhongshan. In fact, he took the name in Japan. During the Russo-Japanese War, Mr. Sun advocated Pan-Asianism in Britain. At that time, Britain and Japan were still in an alliance, and the British were already jealous of Japan's strength. Mr. Sun, as a sage, had already begun to advocate Pan-Asianism.</p>
<p>In short, building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is everyone's business. Everyone must sincerely work hard to increase production in order to enhance our strength to resist Britain and the United States. Just as gas is used to emit light, and steam is used to generate power, we must cater to the times. If we build a machine, we must be able to research it on the one hand and be able to apply it on the other. Recently, we have also cooperated with Vietnam. Some people oppose this move, but we demand that the economic structures of various parts of East Asia be balanced and circulated. If Anglo-American goods do not come, we must still find sources. We want to harmonize the economies of Vietnam and China. After the Japanese army entered Vietnam, there was a shortage of goods in the stores in Vietnam at first, but later the goods gradually circulated, so Annam and other places had thoroughly understood the truth of economic co-prosperity. Recently, China has a shortage of gasoline and asked Japan to subsidize it, so Japan's gasoline made up for China's lack of gasoline. Just like paper, on the one hand it is consumed, and on the other hand there should be manufacturing methods, so the Co-Prosperity Sphere is to harmonize production and sales, and there is appropriate coordination of material and human resources.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, because the war is in progress, it is inevitable that there will be an impact from the war. For example, the invasion of submarines and planes, Qingdao and Shanghai, etc., may be affected, so Japan is now working hard to build defenses and strive to prepare for any eventuality. We want to make the people in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere as if they are under an iron umbrella, so that the people can live and work in peace and contentment, and various constructions are coordinated and developed for the Co-Prosperity Sphere. In short, we must treat each other frankly and sincerely, and work together to complete the Co-Prosperity Sphere. We ask the people of the Co-Prosperity Sphere to unite together, and concentrate human and material resources for the Co-Prosperity Sphere. I have been dispatched to come here, and I will do my best to sacrifice and strive to the end for the completion of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."</p>

<h3>Rice Industry Notifies All Stores to Conscientiously Sell Rations; Bundling Sales of Flour May Be Suspended for a Period</h3>
<p>The sixth installment of rations will be sold starting tomorrow. In order to prevent ration rice stores from engaging in malpractice and irregular behavior when selling household rations, the concession authorities have adopted strict measures to monitor whether there are any shortages in the amount of rice sold by each rice store selling household rations. For rice stores with irregular behavior, they will be punished according to the seriousness of the circumstances. The rice industry has reiterated the previous order, notifying all member rice stores to share the authorities' goal of maintaining the people's food supply, serve the public, and check the measuring instruments accurately when selling household rations, and measure with standard measuring instruments. If, due to temporary negligence in inspection, there is a shortage in the amount and is punished, the guild will not provide protection. Be careful not to regret it.</p>
<p>The Seventh Installment Will Sell Corn in Addition</p>
<p>The Rice and Grain Affairs Office of the two concessions is now seriously considering, and plans to instruct each rice store to also sell broken corn when selling the seventh installment of household rice (from the 17th to the 22nd). However, the purchase method and the amount allowed to be purchased are still being negotiated. If it is to be implemented at that time, it will be jointly announced, and starting from that installment, flour may be temporarily suspended from being allocated. It is found that since the start of rationed food distribution in the city, rice stores have not only sold white rice and broken rice, but also sold flour at the same time. Each household can purchase one and a half catties per installment, so the amount of flour sold so far has been very considerable. In order to suit rationing purposes, it is planned to take this measure.</p>
<p>French Concession Baojia Heads Issued Special Identification Cards</p>
<p>After the completion of the Baojia system in the French Concession, the French authorities greatly praised the fact that the Baojia heads in each district were able to fulfill their missions, so special identification cards were issued for the identification cards of each Bao and Jia head. First, for identification purposes, and second, the certificate has several conveniences, such as special passage, to reward their hard work. It is learned that the Baojia heads in each district have already issued application forms from the Lianbao in each district and requested to be issued after filling them out. It is expected that they will be officially issued within a few days.</p>
<p>Rationed Bread Not Yet Sold Widely</p>
<p>The matter of issuing rationed bread has started yesterday. The authorities of the two concessions issued another notice last night, making some changes to the price of bread. From now on, the wholesale price of bread will be set at 2 yuan and 5 jiao in Central Reserve Certificates per pound, and the retail price will be 2 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen in Central Reserve Certificates per pound. The size of the bread should be appropriately specified. Bread shops only sell bread to those who hold bread coupons. Not all bread shops in the French Concession sold rationed bread yesterday. It is learned that this is because residents in some districts have not yet obtained bread certificates.</p>

<h3>Living Standards of Chinese Employees Edited by the Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council (4)</h3>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Based on analysis and observation, the situation is most difficult for employee families belonging to the so-called "gown-wearing class," especially those with lower incomes. In recent times, living expenses have risen sharply. Even families with higher incomes may not be much better off. The decline in the living standards of this employee class can be attributed to several factors: The salaries of employees are not very high to begin with. Since the outbreak of war, prices have risen far more than the allowances added. Among one hundred households, 42% of heads of households earn less than 100 to 200 old legal tender yuan in regular salary, 22% earn less than 100 yuan, and 36% earn 200 yuan or more. The distribution is shown in the following table:</p>
<p>Even before the war, when the currency value had not depreciated, a salary of 100 yuan for a family of eight meant an average of just under 13 yuan per person, which was insufficient to cover the costs of food, clothing, housing, and transportation. Last year, in December, the average head of household allowance was slightly more than 1.8 times the original salary. The increase in allowances lagged far behind the rise in prices. This is the first reason.</p>
<p>Employee families have many children, averaging 3.45 per family, compared to 2.14 for worker families. Among one hundred households, eight have no children, while the remaining ninety-two have a total of three hundred and forty-five children. The distribution is as follows:</p>
<p>Number of Children Number of Families</p>
<p>1 12</p>
<p>2 18</p>
<p>3 8</p>
<p>4 24</p>
<p>5 13</p>
<p>6 8</p>
<p>7 8</p>
<p>8 1</p>
<p>Total 92 Families</p>
<p>The majority of heads of household and housewives keeping accounts are in their prime. The average age of the head of household is 36.89 years, and the average age of the housewife is 33.50 years. There are 24 families with four children. The more people there are, the less money is available per person for food, clothing, housing, and transportation. This is the second reason.</p>
<p>Employee families often have dependents, averaging 1.15 per family, compared to only 0.90 for worker families. Employee families still maintain the large family system, so the head of household bears a heavy burden. This is the third reason. An analysis of dependents is recorded below:</p>
<p>Dependent Average Number of People per Family</p>
<p>Grandmother ·02</p>
<p>Father ·09</p>
<p>Mother ·025</p>

<p>The association also issued an unnumbered circular yesterday, saying that it has been found that the number of checks (i.e., allocation slips) issued by the fellow banks to the association's current account often contains the characters "thousand" and "hundred". Because the "人" radical is not added, they are easily altered by others. Recently, there have been cases of checks opened to the association by fellow banks, which were discovered in time and were not deceived. In order to prevent such abuses, please write all the "thousand" and "hundred" characters on the checks opened by the bank in the future in uppercase, "仟" and "佰", so as to be cautious.</p>
<p>There is No Lack of Absorption at Low Prices Cotton Cloth Price Increase More Intense</p>
<p>East Spun Goods Market, yesterday, was stable and firm. The new order for 12-pound dragon head fine cloth opened at 166 yuan. The low price was 164 yuan, and the closing price rose to 168 yuan, an increase of 3 yuan per bolt from the previous day. Silver orders were 154 yuan, colorful ball fine cloth was 157 yuan, and Flying Fish was 155 yuan, all up 4 yuan. Five Fortune twill was 149 yuan. The opening price of the four gentlemen serge was 6 yuan 6.2 cents, and the low price was 6 yuan 5.2 cents. Because there were many absorbers at low prices, the closing price rose to 6 yuan 6.8 cents, and each code rose 1.3 cents. The bank's single price was 6 yuan 1.5 cents, an increase of 5 cents.</p>
<p>Factory Cloth The peers on this street have a slight appetite, and the market is showing a strong trend. 16-pound earth coarse cloth is 170 yuan, and each bolt has increased by 5 yuan. Flying Hong is 165 yuan, an increase of 2 yuan. The new word of 9 pounds is 107 yuan, flat. The 12-pound earth fine cloth is 150 yuan, an increase of 4 yuan. The Dapeng is 145 yuan, up 3 yuan.

<p>New Branches and Dried Fruits Compete for Sale at Low Profits The Goods are Sold Out Instantly This Year's Harvest is More Abundant</p>
<p>This time the new branches and dried fruits are on the stage, and the products of Guangdong and Fujian provinces have arrived. For example, the glutinous rice branches of Guangdong are the best of the dried branches. The difference between the opening price and the selling price is less than 1 cent. The rest, such as Jinshan Yuan branches, flat branches, and Zhangzhou's early red branches, are mostly sold at the opening price, with extremely low profits. Therefore, although the number of arrivals has reached more than 1,500 boxes, they have all been sold out, and most of them have been taken away along the Hangzhou Road. The selling price of glutinous rice branches is 1,600 yuan, Jinshan Yuan branches is 600 yuan, Jinshan flat branches is 660 yuan, early red branches is 400 yuan, and Chen Lanxing branches is 350 yuan. This year's harvest is more abundant, and the number of arrivals in the future will inevitably loosen again, so the parties are holding a sacrificial attitude in order to expand sales.</p>
<p>Sugar Stocks Spin and Decrease Slightly</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar stock order of the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office was restored due to Saturday, and the transaction was sparse, and the trend was hovering slightly loose. The association's board of directors still set the initial market price of coarse sugar shares at 299 yuan, and then closed at 298.5 yuan, with a total turnover of 700 bags, which is half a yuan less than the previous day. Red sugar shares were not traded.</p>
<p>Tangerine Cakes Are in High Demand</p>
<p>Bridge cakes are in high demand, and those who have arrived at Gulangyu have not been shipped out due to the lack of convenient wheels recently. Yesterday, it was heard that someone had arrived with a dozen pieces, and the asking price was surprisingly high. The parties did not bargain, resulting in a lack of transactions. It is expected that there will be a regular market when the goods arrive at Shen.</p>
<p>Cheap Goods are Distributed The Bean Market Turns Loose</p>
<p>The bean market has been affected by the continuous distribution of cheap beans, and buyers' willingness to enter the market is small. Therefore, the market is showing a loose and flat trend. A total of 70 bags of Tianjin green beans were opened, priced at 228 yuan to 225 yuan, and 90 bags of red beans were priced at 165 yuan, and 100 bags of Sangyuan soybeans were priced at 173 yuan.</p>
<p>The supply and demand of bean cakes are scarce, and the market is generally flat. Yesterday, 500 pieces of the February stack order of Shengji cakes were opened, priced at 60 yuan 7.5 cents.</p>
<p>Bran is still sluggish for domestic sales, and there are few sellers, but the price has turned stable and firm. Yesterday, the stack order of the Xin small package bran in May was opened for 300 bags, priced at 95 yuan to 95.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Summer Medicine Suffers from Squeezing</p>
<p>Summer medicines are still weak and unsustainable. Because customer sales are very rare, general hoarders are eager to sell. The sales on this street are generally squeezed by miscellaneous brands, so the price is powerless to rise. For example, Tiger Brand headache powder is 20 yuan, Ten Thousand Gold Oil is 17 yuan 5 cents, Bagua Dan is 15 yuan, Partridge Vegetable is 52 yuan 5 cents, Dragon Tiger Rendan is 14 yuan, and Invincible Tooth Powder is 9 yuan 2 cents. The selling prices are all downstream, and it is difficult to sell them.</p>
<h3>Soap Market Suddenly Turns Cold</h3>
<p>Among daily necessities, such as the selling price of soap, after the price limit was announced by the authorities, the black market selling price suddenly became quiet. The peers' competition for sales has mostly stopped, because there are few benefits and many harms. Furthermore, it is difficult to transport by car, and they are willing to let go of the business. Therefore, the market atmosphere is even more sluggish. If Huang Xiangmao soap can still be sold, the transaction has not disappeared. The quoted price is still 210 yuan, and the rest have very few transactions. Gu Benzao is 290 yuan, Bai Xiangmaozao is 230 yuan, Scissorzao is 250 yuan, Phoenix brand matches are 2,650 yuan, Beauty brand is 2,850 yuan, Golden Ding brand is 2,500 yuan, miscellaneous brands are 2,100 yuan, White Reese foreign candles are 120 yuan, Monk Hat brand is 115 yuan, and miscellaneous brands are 90 yuan, all showing a market with no transactions.</p>

<h3>The Problem of Maids in the Family</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>In general families, the problem of maids often becomes a topic of discussion for housewives. The maid in House A is lazy in doing things, the maid in House B often steals things, and the maid in House C gets up too late.</p>
<p>However, thinking calmly, maids are mostly uneducated. They don't know their responsibilities, nor do they understand the meaning of their lives. Therefore, everything still needs to be guided by the housewife. Moreover, sometimes the lack of planning by housewives can also be said to be one of the reasons why housework cannot be carried out smoothly. Here are a few methods that may be helpful for housewives:</p>
<p>There should be a plan for all the housework to be done. What to do on Monday, what to do on Tuesday. Do not change the plan temporarily, causing chaos and making the maids complain.</p>
<p>The menu for each day should have a little planning, and tell the maid the night before or in the morning so that they can do some preparation work. Of course, it would be best if housewives could take on the design work themselves.</p>
<p>When hiring a new maid, the rules of the house must be told to her one by one.</p>
<p>There should be regulations for the time to get up and rest every day.</p>
<p>Housewives' own work should also be scheduled so that it can be coordinated with the work of the maids.</p>
<p>When maids can fulfill their responsibilities for their work, everything else does not need to be worried about.</p>
<p>The three most important points when choosing a maid are honesty, diligence, and health.</p>
<p>When there are things worth rewarding, they should be rewarded.</p>
<h3>Great Women</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>In this new era, both men and women can receive equal education. Therefore, many great achievements are created by women.</p>
<p>For this point, we can easily cite a few examples below.</p>
<p>Madam Curie, together with her husband, invented radium, opening up a new path for the medical community. The creator of the World Red Cross Society was not a man, but Crenna Biden. Tonkloff of Sweden was a Nobel Prize winner. The daughter of President Wilson helped her father with medical books. Ossa Johnson helped her husband with exploration work and co-authored books describing the lives of natives in Africa. The founder of Mother's Day was Anna Jarvers. There was also Mary Lyon, who founded the first women's university in the United States. These are all great works.</p>
<p>Women have many things to do. When praising the greatness of women, I hope that more great women will be produced.</p>
<h3>Between Sisters-in-Law</h3>
<p>— Yingdai</p>
<p>If we make a careful observation of general families, then anyone can see that there are many disputes in the family, which often arise from sisters-in-law. The so-called sisters-in-law are usually called elder sister-in-law and younger sister-in-law. Between sisters-in-law, there are indeed some who can get along, but most of them are incompatible and often argue and quarrel.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we can see that in a good family, the brothers are originally very harmonious. But after marrying their wives, the disharmony between the sisters-in-law affects the feelings between the brothers. Even the brothers gradually discriminate against each other due to discord, eventually becoming strangers. The affection of blood relatives is completely gone. A good family is turned into a constant source of quarrels.</p>
<p>We further study why disputes occur between sisters-in-law, probably because parents-in-law treat their daughters-in-law differently, or they demand to divide the property and form small families. Most women are narrow-minded. If they do more work or receive less money, they will express injustice and start to attack each other. They may even fight openly from behind, often quarreling.</p>
<p>From the above, we can see that the reason for the disharmony between sisters-in-law is partly caused by the different love or treatment of the parents-in-law, but on the other hand, the sisters-in-law themselves certainly have factors that cause disputes. The main thing is that everyone has selfish intentions and suspects and envies each other. When they become incompatible, they will quarrel or dispute, affecting the happiness of the entire family.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to maintain the happiness of the family, we hope that sisters-in-law can avoid disputes. On the one hand, we should hope that the parents-in-law treat their daughters-in-law the same, regardless of how much they do. On the other hand, the sisters-in-law should not have prejudices or suspicions, do more work, and share less property, but cherish each other like sisters. As for the brothers, they should also be a little manly. Pillow talk should not be listened to. When the wife is talking bad about her sister-in-law, not only should she not be believed, but also explained and persuaded.</p>
<p>If this can be done, the sisters-in-law will be harmonious all year round and there will be no quarrels. As a result, family disputes and troubles can be avoided, at least in part. In other words, the happiness in the family can be maintained or increased because of the harmony of the sisters-in-law.</p>
<h3>Rice Supplements</h3>
<p>— Tianyi</p>
<p>Nothing in the world is more difficult than eating. Especially now in Shanghai. Therefore, in this time of "rice as expensive as pearls," you have to think of other ways. The following are ways to remedy the lack of rice.</p>
<p>Mung Bean Porridge: In this hot weather, eating cold mung bean porridge in the morning and evening is refreshing and palatable.</p>
<p>Red Bean Rice: First, heat the red beans and water in a pot, then add the rice. Once the rice is cooked, it will turn red, which is beautiful. It is also fragrant and delicious when eaten.</p>
<p>Vegetable Rice with Potatoes: When cooking vegetable rice, add some potatoes to eat together for a better flavor.</p>
<p>The above three methods are just a few examples. This not only solves the "lack of rice" problem, but also the price of mung beans, red beans, and potatoes is cheaper than white rice. If you often rotate and change the patterns, you can also adjust your appetite.</p>
<p>Family Mailbox</p>
<p>Dear Editor, you complain that I don't say polite words. I also have a difficult problem now. Please give me some advice.</p>
<p>Since I met a boyfriend last year, he is loyal and reliable, and has superior knowledge, a noble profession, and an aspiring ambition. His character is good and his attitude is generous. I really admire him very much. My love with him can be said to have entered a decisive stage. Unexpectedly, recently my parents vaguely arranged a marriage with another man without my knowledge. When I learned about it, the matter was already settled. I immediately objected to this unfree marriage. Although the other party is quite rich, I don't like the lazy playboy. I often say to my parents, "It's better to have a skill than to have millions of wealth," but I can't win my parents' consent, and sometimes I even get scolded. Please tell me what good strategy to solve it, so that I can get free heaven and earth, I sincerely hope! Sincerely hope! With this special wish for your peace, Shi Xiuying, August 6th.</p>
<p>Ms. Xiuying, we believe that the necessary conditions for the formation of marriage are emotional and legal, and neither is indispensable. You disapprove of the marriage contract of the rich family弟不务正业 arranged by your parents. If you have reached the legal age, you have the right to be autonomous. However, we dare not agree with you only knowing the law and ignoring family feelings. As for the boyfriend you admire, the marriage problem seems to be temporarily not considered, because before your engagement is resolved, this kind of remembrance will only increase the pain in your life journey. You should enrich your knowledge and devote yourself to your studies, so that you can build the foundation of your modern marriage and get a free world. By the way, we also want to sincerely advise the lady's parents not to admire the temporary vanity and sacrifice the lifelong chapter of your lovely children. The tragedy in today's families is due to the fact that parents did not make such reasonable considerations. I really don't know how many there are, I hope the lady's relatives pay attention to this!

<h3>Cooling Powder One Dose</h3>
<p>— Jue</p>
<p>Yellow vegetable leaves, fried with salt, only fill the stomach; if you are greedy for taste, will there be many troubles in the future?</p>
<p>Broken monk's robe, priceless treasure, patched up and patched up every year; a box of cages hide things for others, how often do you wear them to the old age!</p>
<p>Hardwood bed, soft grass mat, sleeping soundly without worry; brocade quilt and embroidered mattress cannot sleep, tossing and turning until dawn!</p>
<p>Old house, just sweep, repair it in time and it won't collapse; how many beautiful buildings have recently become rubble and green grass!</p>
<p>I appreciated the fan held by a friend during the banquet, and after reading the text on it, I recited it several times. I felt that it not only had a very thorough indication of life, but also a very accurate criticism of the current family. It was no different from taking a dose of cooling powder in the hot summer. I sincerely hope that readers will savor it carefully.</p>
<h3>Health Exercise Method (7)</h3>
<p>The complete set of health exercise methods consists of 27 kinds of exercises. The 21st to 27th styles are the third group, which is the last group, and can be published in the next issue.</p>
<p>Health exercise is the simplest and most effective exercise. As long as you treat it as a daily lesson, proceed gradually, and practice without interruption, you will surely achieve the goal of ensuring health and enjoying the happiness of a healthy family.</p>
<p>The 21st and 22nd styles published in this issue function to give the often-neglected muscles and tendons of the waist a chance to move, and thus gradually become healthy and strong. As for the abdominal muscles and tendons and various internal organs, they also receive considerable benefit through the rotation of the body. When turning in a circle, the circumference should of course be as large as possible. When turning with legs crossed, do not let your shoulders and back touch the ground, keep your heels on the ground, and sit firmly on the ground with your buttocks, only turning your upper body in a circle.</p>
<p>Leaning forward will cause a hunchback. If you want to prevent or correct it, the 23rd style is the most effective method, because this exercise functions to change the habitually forward-leaning back muscles and tendons to lean backwards. When doing it, the head and both shoulders should be raised as high as possible, and do not touch the ground when turning left and right. The legs and buttocks must not move.</p>
<p>When doing the 24th style, as long as the hands and elbows are properly supported, it is not difficult to lift the body upwards. When the body position is appropriate, and you feel stable and comfortable, then you can stretch the legs up and down as you wish. Also, when stretching up and down, as long as you can maintain balance, it does not matter whether it is vertical or oblique. Also, when the legs return to their original position, the closer the knees are to the shoulders, the better.</p>
<p>(Figures 21 and 22) Sit upright on the ground, with both feet inserted into a fixed frame or leather ring, with both arms crossed in front of the chest. Turn the upper body to the right in a circle, and repeat six times. Count each complete circle as one time.</p>
<p>The 22nd style is to turn in a circle to the left, also repeating six times.</p>
<p>(Figure 23) Lie flat on the stomach, with the abdomen touching the ground, and both arms crossed behind the back. Raise the head and shoulders, and turn the body first to the left and then to the right. When turning, the head must be raised, and do not lower it to the ground. Repeat six times, counting each turn to the right as one time.</p>
<p>(Figure 24) From lying flat, raise both feet and buttocks, as shown by the dotted line in the figure. Support the body with both hands and elbows, raise both legs upwards, and then return to the original position. Repeat six times, counting each return of both legs to the original position as one time.</p>
<h3>A Week's Home-Style Menu</h3>
<p>Last week, a reader, Mr. Wang Pingfu, wrote to ask about the method of making oxtail soup and country-style soup. These two were originally famous items in Western cuisine and are not found in home-style dishes. However, it is not impossible to make them to eat. For oxtail soup, first cut the oxtail into small pieces, add good soy sauce, and then put the chopped tomatoes into the pot and simmer until crispy. Country-style soup is another name for ten-vegetable soup. You can cut Chinese cabbage, carrots, lettuce, tomatoes, and other things into thin strips, and braise them all together with soy sauce. If you want to eat something substantial, you can add some shredded chicken or shredded beef. If you want a Western flavor, you must add butter, but butter is not easy to get now, so save it. Monday: Stir-fried chives with shredded pork, pan-fried tofu, winter melon soup with ham, stir-fried bean curd sheets with green vegetables</p>
<p>Tuesday: Vegetable beef soup, sweet and sour ribbonfish, stir-fried dried bean curd threads with celery, cold eggplant salad with sesame paste</p>
<p>Wednesday: Meatballs braised with Chinese cabbage hearts, dried shrimp eggs, vegetarian tofu soup, stir-fried purslane</p>
<p>Thursday: Curry shredded beef, steamed fish with fermented grains, stir-fried broad beans with sweet sauce, cold jellyfish with mung bean sprouts</p>
<p>Friday: Tofu braised with minced meat, sweet and sour salted yellow croaker, stir-fried gluten with loofah, fava bean paste salad with scallions</p>
<p>Saturday: Ten-vegetable winter melon soup, chives salad with egg skin, braised cabbage, stir-fried red cowpeas</p>
<p>Sunday: Stir-fried duck giblets, crab in batter, vegetarian ten-vegetable dish, celery salad</p>
