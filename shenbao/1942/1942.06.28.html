<h3>九　伊拉克的今昔（二）</h3>
<p>位於底格里斯河上流，高出海面八百二十　之高地，著名的摩蘇爾石油區就在那裏。世界第一次大戰前，原屬土耳其所領有，歐戰中爲英人所占領，戰後由國際聯盟委任英國統治。後因土耳其戰勝了希臘，與英，法，意，等列強開會於洛桑，土耳其曾提議要求將摩蘇爾一省歸還土國。英國堅不允許。僅許以每年給予百分之二十五的純益金。故伊拉克的油權一向爲英國所操縱。</p>
<p>當歐洲第一次大戰前，德國有所謂三B政策，什麽叫三B政策呢？就是從柏林Berlin起，經過君　但丁堡之拜占庭Byzanit英國和德國妥協了，成立一個ain至波斯首都巴格達Beyd合資的公司，經營開採，而俄ad，擬修　一歐亞的鐵路，國和荷蘭都摒之門外了。因這三地均以B字起，故名，由於上次歐戰的結果，德當時俄國也有所謂二P政策，國的權利，常然被剝削了，伊就是從彼得城Petrburg拉克的油公司便爲英國獨占。至波斯灣Persia擬築一可是因爲伊拉克的石油區過於鐵路。但究其實際，都是為了豐富了，美，荷，法也不能忘爭奪這豐富的油區。而英國和懷無事，致引起國際的石油戰荷蘭也要想染得一指。結果，。到了一九三○年由英，美，荷，波，法各國合組一大國際石油公司，在傑克地方附近另行開採，不過名義上雖爲國際合組，實際則英國獨占有礦權百分之四十。</p>
<p>偉大的輸油管</p>
<p>伊拉克雖然在歷史上曾爲歐亞非三大陸交通的孔道，可是自海通以後，已失其重要性。但旣擁有豐富的埋藏量石油資源，那末運輸就成了一個　大問題。最初摩蘇爾油區所產之油是利用底格里斯河由波斯灣出口，經紅海，然後再轉向歐洲。可是一因繞道的周折。二因射的爾阿拉伯河口堆積淤塞太利害，總覺有些不方便。三因供應英國地中海艦隊的不靈便。於是便有人計劃把這豐富的石油直接輸送至地中海沿岸。英美法荷波合組的國際石油公司便招集了資本，再由美國聘請了工程師設計輸油管的敷設。經過了七年長時間的工作，終於一九三五年」月二十一日完成這偉大的輸油管工程。全長　一千一百五十哩。建設費達一千萬錢以上。也可說是世界的偉大工程之一。</p>
<p>這輸油管的敷設是從油區傑克地方起，到幼發拉底斯河沿岸的哈第桑，分爲兩路；一是橫貫伊拉克一直向西橫穿叙利亞入境而至地中海沿岸的得力鮑里，又一是向西南橫斷敘利亞沙漠，再南折經外約但，而人巴勒斯坦，然後達地中海沿岸之海法，自這條偉大的輸油管工程完竣後，該公司的運輸費要節省了很多，現在每年的總產額常達四百萬噸以上。脆弱的國防</p>
<p>伊拉克的國防，由於她國力的薄弱，當然是很脆弱的。據一九三八年的國勢調查，伊拉克的常備兵共有二萬八千名，軍事費約爲一百五十萬。迭那Dinar，約合英幣一百五十萬磅。凡男子在十九歲至二十五歲的靑年都有服兵役的義務，採取近代國家的微兵制。</p>
<p>伊拉克因和海的接觸關係很少，沒有海軍的設防，故他的國防是以陸軍爲主。其實力可分爲：㈠騎兵二聯隊；㈡野戰砲兵九中隊；㈢山砲兵五中隊；㈣機械化兵一中隊；㈤機關槍汽車一中隊；㈥信號一大隊；㈦裝甲車一大隊；㈧工兵一大隊；㈨水兵一隊。不過成爲近代國家，總要有一些空防，那末伊拉克爲着點綴空防起見也有空軍的設立。她的實力有：㈠偵察機二隊；㈡轟炸機一隊；㈢戰鬥機一隊；㈣聯絡機一隊。這就是伊拉克的軍備實力。</p>
<p>可是英國爲了保護她油區的利益，在伊拉克境內設有軍事根據地，航空軍總司令處，在伊拉克首都巴格達西北五十餘哩的地方，費了五萬萬英磅，開闢了一個水陸兩用的大飛行塲。駐有數百架飛機，而且還有重兵屯駐於伊國境內，在她北方的蘇聯也有相　的空軍和陸軍屯駐於高加索，把伊拉克威脅着。</p>
<p>巴格達位於底格里河中流，當水陸交通的要路，爲伊拉克的首都，又爲隊商貿易的集中地，人口約有三十五萬。歐洲印度間的電綫，由此通亞列波。第一次歐戰時，英國和土耳其在此曾發生激戰。在回敎全盛時代，哈利發以此爲根據地。爲蕯拉遜帝國的舊都，且爲阿拉伯學術的中心地。今伊拉克政府的國防部即設於巴格達之北門，以土耳其昔日之司令部爲其軍隊的駐屯所。</p>

<p>今年的衛生運動，更有一個特點，就是特別着重營養的常識，使平民階級，也可以因此而享受他們所需要的營養，自明天起到七月一日止在八仙橋會所二樓，除陳列各種圖表模型標本物品外，並有表演動作，每天上午十時到下午六時，不收門票，我們旣然到得這個難得的機會，的確值得去參觀一下。</p>
<p>周文硯君儲余助</p>

<p>保健運動</p>
<p>健康是任何人所需要的，尤其是在現在道樣的時候，必須具有堅强的體格，纔能以振奮有爲百折不撓的精神，來應付一切困難：和克服生活的威脅。</p>
<p>我們欲達到這一目的，自非注意運動不可，因爲運動的重要性，實在和陽光空氣與飲食，一般無二，缺了運動，即無由確保健康。所謂運動，不一定要到健身房去，祇要你有恒心，而練習的方式，又簡便而有實效。如今日本刊，開始刋載的　氏保健運動法；　身體的健康，當不啻獲有健康的保障。我們果欲享受個人以及家庭健康幸福，對於這種値得硏究的運動新法，希望讀者及其全家父母子女，均加以研究和實　。</p>
<h3>給嬰兒斷乳不可任意為之</h3>
<p>— 毛忍</p>
<p>最近一般做母親的對於處理嬰兒的時候，差不多都變成一種神經質的人了。孩子的大便發生靑色的時候，便以爲是生了脚氣；孩子若是吐乳，又以爲乳汁不合適了。因了這個原故，也不由醫學的立塲正式檢討一下，便給孩子斷了乳。但是母親的乳汁，對於孩子實是良好而適當的食品，應當可能的以正當方法供給孩子，還可以說是使孩子一生得有健康體格的第一步。孩子吃着母親乳汁的時候，即使大便稍微有些發靑，做母親的也大可不必戰戰兢兢的憂慮。若是實在不放心，可以帶孩子到嬰兒保健的醫院或專門醫生處去診視一次。若是一個不明醫理的母親，因爲過於疼愛孩子而胡亂調治，或者反會把孩子的健康喪失了。</p>

<h3>小趣味</h3>
<p>— 雨山成珉</p>
<p>諸位小朋友當學校　放了假以後，在家溫課之餘，不妨將這算題仔細地做做，一定會感覺得非常有興味的。</p>
<p>我想有幾個小朋友，一定常常會問他的爸媽，要將十三擋算盤上的算珠，一個一個地每逢十進一，將它打滿，要費多少時候？驟然看來，似乎一會兒就可打滿的，可是實際上却沒有這麽容易呢</p>
<p>試以每分鐘打上一五〇算珠計算，欲將十三擋算盤打滿，則需時爲二一一三九八年七月一三日又一九時五一分六秒鐘、假使平均每人能活八十歲，則須二千六百四十三世相傳，方能於最後一人三十八歲零七個月十三日十九小時五十一分六秒時打滿一算盤；不過其間睡眠等時候亦須在內，小朋友們，這不是一個驚人的數目嗎？（移酬助貸學金）</p>

<p>— 華英女士</p>

<h3>South Bank of Poyang Lake: Raozhou City Fell Yesterday; Japanese Troops Continue to Advance in Southern Shanxi</h3>
<p>From Duyang, a telegram from a certain warship on the 27th to the Allied Press reported that navy soldiers who landed at Bazinao on the south bank of Poyang Lake on the [date missing] occupied Raozhou, twenty kilometers south, at 7:30 PM this evening. The landing forces advanced through the muddy paths, attacking the high ground near the suburbs of Bazinao, defeating the enemy's resistance, and then attacking Raozhou City. Raozhou is a crucial base for the Yangtze River Defense Headquarters.</p>
<p>A naval correspondent traveling with the Japanese fleet cabled the Allied Press on the 27th, stating that the Japanese navy operating in the Yangtze River landed at Bazinao, twenty kilometers north of Raozhou on the south bank of Poyang Lake yesterday. After invading the mountainous area, they are now advancing towards Raozhou. Despite the adverse weather, naval aircraft are cooperating with the landing forces, alternately bombing military targets northwest of Raozhou.</p>
<p>A telegram from the front lines in southern Shanxi to the Allied Press on the 27th reports from the battlefield that the 20,000-strong force of the 27th Army under the command of Chongqing is gradually being encircled by the Japanese army. They encountered an urgent attack today. Several Japanese units captured Lingchuan in southeastern Shanxi on the 25th and advanced the next day, driving out the 300-strong 46th Division, ten kilometers east of Lingchuan. On the same day, other Japanese units repelled 500 men ten kilometers southeast of Lingchuan.</p>
<h3>Colonel Hirade Discusses: Extremely Heavy Losses of British and American Ships; Difficulties in Replenishment Threaten Survival; Japanese Submarines Active Along the US and Canadian Coasts</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th, Allied Press: Naval spokesman Colonel Hirade stated at a roundtable discussion at the "Asahi Shimbun" yesterday that the significant losses suffered by British ships pose a grave threat to the country's survival. The country needs at least eight million tons of shipping to survive, but the existing ships of Britain and the United States have been reduced to nine and a half million tons due to attacks by Axis submarines. Since the start of the war, Axis submarines have sunk 17 million tons of British and American ships, of which Japan sank two million tons. If German and Italian submarines can maintain their current destructive power, the existing nine and a half million tons of British and American ships will soon be annihilated. In April and May alone, German and Italian submarines sank two million tons of British and American ships. The current shipbuilding capacity of Britain and the United States is only 250,000 tons per month, making replenishment difficult. As for the British and American warships sunk by the Japanese navy, there are already 162 ships, totaling 747,550 tons, and 101 ships damaged, totaling 420,700 tons.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 27th, Allied Press: The Canadian Naval Department announced yesterday that a Canadian-built ship, currently leased by the Allied forces, was damaged by a torpedo from a Japanese submarine near the west coast of Canada. All the sailors were rescued after drifting in lifeboats for twelve hours.</p>
<h3>Large Numbers of Japanese Aircraft Attacked Port Moresby Yesterday</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 25th, Allied Telegraph: According to an announcement from Canberra, a large number of Japanese aircraft attacked Port Moresby again yesterday. Details of the losses have not been released.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador Sato Meets with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>The content of the conversation has not been announced.</p>
<p>Kuybyshev, 27th, Allied Press: It has been revealed that Japanese Ambassador Sato visited the Soviet Foreign Ministry yesterday at 10:00 PM and met with Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky to discuss matters, the nature of which has not been disclosed.</p>
<h3>American Triangular Defense Line Feels Threatened</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 27th, Havas: Ottawa announced yesterday that several Canadian bombers and fighter squadrons are now stationed in Alaska with the US Air Force to protect maritime communications in the area from the northwest to the American mainland.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 27th, Allied Press: Since the Japanese army launched an offensive in the Aleutian Islands, the position of Alaska has been directly and significantly threatened. Therefore, future developments are worthy of attention. The United States is also urgently seeking to connect the mainland with Alaska via land transportation routes. Apart from air and sea routes, land transportation through Canadian territory has not yet been completed. Currently, going north from Seattle only reaches Whitehorse in Canada, so a highway must be built to connect them. This is the famous Canadian-Alaskan Highway. The proposal for the construction of this highway began in 1929, and in May 1923, President Hoover appointed three commissioners to conduct research. In June 1940, Alaskan representative Tersani requested the House of Representatives to allocate $25 million for the construction of the highway. Until recently, the highway construction plan was being negotiated between the United States and Canada. Previously, on March 17, Havas reported that the United States and Canada had reached a basic agreement on the construction of the highway, but with Alaska now in a dangerous situation, the construction of the highway is unlikely to be realized.</p>
<p>Berlin, 26th, Allied Press: After the Japanese Imperial Headquarters officially announced the news of the Japanese army landing in the Aleutian Islands, the Nazi Party's official newspaper, Angriff, published a commentary on the Japanese military victories in a prominent position on the 25th. The gist of the commentary stated that after the United States was defeated at Pearl Harbor, it repeatedly attempted to counterattack Japan, but the result was another defeat in the Coral Sea. Japan has thus established its absolutely advantageous position and can use important military bases such as Syonan Island to conduct operations in the Pacific. At the same time, the Japanese occupation of the Aleutian Islands has dealt a fatal blow to the 5,000-kilometer-long line from Dutch Harbor to Laval, and the strategic importance of Hawaii has also been reduced. The so-called triangular defense line formed by the United States with Dutch Harbor, Hawaii, and Panama has also been severely threatened.</p>
<h3>Turkish Government Takes Over Seaport</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 27th, Havas: The port of Mersin in southern Anatolia, Turkey, originally managed by a privately-run company, is an important port for Turkey's overseas trade. The government has taken it over in accordance with the contract signed with the company.</p>
<h3>Major Changes in Senior Swedish Military Leadership Expected</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 27th, Havas:</p>
<p>Local evening newspapers anticipate large-scale changes in the senior command of the Swedish army. The new appointments are expected to be decided at the Council of State meeting next Tuesday.</p>
<h3>Churchill Returns to London, Faces Serious Political Crisis, May Resign from Concurrent Position as Minister of Defense</h3>
<p>London, 27th, Havas: Officials have just announced that Prime Minister Churchill has safely returned home today after completing his visit to the United States. Harriman, the administrator of the US Lend-Lease Act, arrived with him.</p>
<p>Washington, 27th, Havas: Political figures expect that after British Prime Minister Churchill returns to London, a public announcement will be made by officials here explaining the content of President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill's talks.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 27th, Allied Press: British Prime Minister Churchill returned to England this morning after talks with US President Roosevelt in Washington and attending a hastily convened Pacific military conference on Thursday, following the Axis forces' rapid advance into Egypt. He encountered the most serious political crisis since taking office as Prime Minister. The press and members of Parliament do not want to hide their dissatisfaction with Churchill's war strategy. It is widely believed that Churchill will be forced to step down as Minister of Defense, which is almost certain.</p>
<h3>Litvinov Participates in Roosevelt-Churchill Conference, Reviews General War Situation</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 26th, Allied Press: According to Reuters from Washington, President Roosevelt's secretary, O'Leary, announced that Soviet Ambassador to the United States Litvinov met with Roosevelt and Churchill on the 26th for a considerable period of time. The meeting reviewed the entire situation, and representatives from the British, American, and Soviet armies, navies, and air forces also held meetings. US Secretary of State Hull was also present.</p>
<p>Washington, 26th, Havas: Prime Minister Churchill and President Roosevelt continued their talks today.

The British authorities do not seem to value Gandhi's request; they have even refused to publish this declaration because it lists the various reasons why the British should leave India. The British oppression of India is becoming increasingly intolerable to the Indians. As war is increasingly imminent in India, it is necessary for India to take swift action.</p>

<h3>Axis Armored Forces Advance Eastward: Battle of Matruh Begins; British Main Force Establishes Strong Defense Line; Fate of Egypt May Be Decided Soon</h3>
<p>Vima, 27th (Havas Dispatch) - General Headquarters announced this morning that Axis forces have made contact with British defending forces in the Marsa Matruh area.</p>
<p>Cairo, 27th (Havas Dispatch) - The British Middle East Command announced this morning that enemy forces reached a point fifteen miles west of Marsa Matruh yesterday. British advance units engaged enemy advance units in battle all day.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Libyan Border, 26th (Havas Dispatch) - According to news from the Egyptian front, the forces under the command of German General Rommel are advancing eastward. The decisive battle that determines the fate of Egypt will occur in the Marsa Matruh area within the next few days. Large armies from both sides are now concentrated near this area. The Axis forces possess a large number of motorized units for rapid encirclement, estimated at five to six hundred tanks and about ten thousand armored vehicles of various sizes.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Alliance News Agency) - According to a United Press Cairo dispatch, after breaking through the Egyptian border on the night of the 25th, German and Italian forces continued to pursue the British forces. On the night of the 25th, the vanguard reached a location thirty-two kilometers west of Marsa Matruh, a place one hundred and twenty-eight kilometers from the Egyptian border. The German and Italian forces attacked from three sides, while the British forces also concentrated their main force at Marsa Matruh and used air support from Alexandria to reinforce their position and bomb the Axis forces. Another unit was stationed southwest of Marsa Matruh to prevent the German forces from encircling the port. Currently, the vanguard of the German forces has engaged in a fierce tank battle on the open tropical desert with the first line of British defenses.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Libyan Border, 26th (Havas Dispatch) - Military officials here stated that General Rommel decided to attack Marsa Matruh after occupying Tobruk, to pave a path for advancing on Alexandria and Cairo. In recent days, the German forces have been advancing eastward along the Egyptian coast, with no major battles occurring. This is to allow the British forces to cover the retreat of their main force and establish a strong defensive line west of Marsa Matruh. German and Italian reinforcements are continuously arriving at the front lines, so a major battle is expected to occur in the Matruh area soon. According to general opinion, although General Rommel's forces may attempt a large encirclement from the south, they still aim to quickly launch a fierce attack on the British positions. Speculation about General Rommel's strategy varies, simply because there are many natural barriers south of Matruh, so it is predicted that the Axis forces' transportation lines will inevitably be extended. Although the British main force has been redeployed and new positions have been reinforced, the situation remains extremely serious because the German and Italian forces are still very powerful, including the German 21st and 15th Panzer Divisions, as well as the Italian armored divisions. Although the British Eighth Army has suffered setbacks this time, it still possesses a strong fighting force sufficient to defend its positions. In short, the fate of the "Battle for Egypt" will be decided in the next two or three days.</p>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - German fighter squadrons attacked the railway, barracks, airfield, and motorcycle columns east of Marsa Matruh yesterday. Fires broke out in several locations. A train carrying retreating British soldiers was hit by bombs and severely damaged.</p>
<p>Egyptian Defenses Tighten; British Forces Urgently Await Reinforcements</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Libyan Border, 26th (Havas Dispatch) - The British remain silent on whether British forces can quickly obtain reinforcements to defend Egypt. Rumors are circulating that the British Ninth Army and American troops in Syria have set out for Egypt, but the British have made no comment.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the German Border, 26th (Havas Dispatch) - Egyptian defenses are tightening. The British General Headquarters has no other choice but to transfer part of the Ninth Army stationed in Palestine and the Tenth Army stationed in Iraq and Iran to reinforce the defenses. However, both armies are one thousand miles away from Egypt, and the only means of transportation is the railway, which passes through Aleppo, Homs, and Damascus in Syria to reach Alexandria and cannot arrive in less than two or three weeks. However, London is already discussing the possibility of the British army retreating to the Nile River, which is quite surprising. At the same time, the German side claims that Axis forces have now controlled the Sollum and Sidi Barrani airfields, only two hundred and thirty miles from Alexandria. The Egyptian people are closely watching the possibility of Axis forces invading their country. Neutral observers predict that the Axis forces will use Crete and Greece as bases to directly attack the Nile Delta. In addition, a London Times reporter recently warned readers not to be overly optimistic about the extension of the enemy's transportation lines, because the full motorization of the German North African Army is sufficient to overcome some of the difficulties.</p>
<p>Egypt Strictly Adheres to Non-Intervention Policy; Alexandria Evacuates Residents</p>
<p>Istanbul, 25th (Alliance News Agency) - Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas made the following statement in Parliament on the afternoon of the 24th regarding the Libyan war situation and the results of his talks with the British side: "In view of the current situation on the Libyan front, my government has requested information from the British military command and the British Embassy since the 21st and has conducted a detailed review of the British strategy for the war situation. On the 23rd, the British Ambassador sent an official document to my government, stating that the British government has the determination to resist to the end. In my capacity as the military and political leader of Egypt, I have strictly suppressed rumors. Recently, I presented a detailed report on the Libyan war situation to Parliament. I must reiterate that the rumor that my government has accepted Britain's request and declared war on the Axis powers is completely unfounded. My government has consistently adhered to a policy of non-intervention in the war."</p>
<p>Ankara, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas again held a lengthy conversation with Sir Lampson, the British Ambassador to Egypt, yesterday. The Egyptian Parliament had requested the British side to issue a statement explaining the latest developments in the war, but the British side refused the request, stating that revealing the information would make it known to the enemy.</p>

<h3>Kharkov Front Battle: German Forces Capture Two Fortresses; Struggle for Sevastopol Intensifies</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Havas Dispatch) - German radio announced tonight that German forces, after unprecedented fierce battles, have occupied the cities of Izyum and Kupyansk. The former is a fortress on the Donets River, which has been repeatedly mentioned during the Battle of Kharkov. The latter is a fortress on the Oskol River, also an industrial center in the Donets River basin. At the same time, the German News Agency also issued a message stating that the German Air Force has been active over Sevastopol, systematically destroying the port of Sevastopol and some remaining positions and fortifications of the Red Army on the western end of the Crimean Peninsula. The Izyum and Kupyansk areas were also bombed. In the central region, German forces bombed various military supply depots and targeted the famous Gorky factory. The Rostov shipyards were also bombed. On the northern front, three Red Army aircraft were destroyed at the Murmansk airfield.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Alliance News Agency) - A foreign radio station here recently broadcast a Moscow message stating that the Kharkov war has been quite fierce in recent days. German forces crossed the Seversky Donets River and began a fierce attack. The Soviet forces under Timoshenko put up a desperate resistance on the west bank of the Oskol River, but by the 25th, the Soviet forces were unable to withstand the German pressure and retreated to Kupyansk. According to a Soviet Information Bureau announcement on the 26th, German and Soviet forces are currently engaged in a fierce battle with many tanks in the area between the Oskol and Krasnaya Rivers. The situation in Sevastopol is even more intense. German forces have broken into several fortresses outside the city and are now attacking the city center.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 26th (Havas Dispatch) - Axis forces have occupied Kupyansk and Izyum. The extent to which the German offensive launched in the Kharkov area five days ago has developed can be seen from these two battles. Kupyansk is about sixty miles southeast of Kharkov, appropriately at the junction of two railways. German forces may have advanced beyond the city to reach a certain point in order to advance towards Voroshilovgrad in the southeast. Voroshilovgrad and Taganrog are the starting points for attacking the Caucasus. It is reported that the troops stationed between Stanlino and the Sea of Azov during the winter, especially those near Taganrog, will be ordered to move eastward, with Rostov as their first target. This city, known as the gateway to the Caucasus, has been bombed several times. The German offensive in the Donets River basin is currently developing in an organized manner, but the port of Sevastopol is still holding out. According to the latest news, the German and Romanian forces have broken through the Red Army defense line protecting the southeastern corner of Sevastopol Bay. The fortress on that line, the famous Inkenman Heights, is now under heavy German attack. The port of Sevastopol originally had a defense force of two hundred thousand regular soldiers and ten thousand civilians, but since the start of the battle for the city, casualties have been heavy, reducing this number by at least half. The Red Army claims that the ratio of Axis to Red Army strength is five to one. For the past twenty days, no fresh troops have arrived in Sevastopol to reinforce the defenses, and they frankly admit that they cannot recover lost positions or repel the enemy. Their only goal in continuing to resist is to delay the German advance on the Caucasus, as Sevastopol is the best supply base and its position is superior to the ports of Odessa and Romania on the Black Sea coast. Once it falls, it will greatly facilitate the German advance on the Caucasus. The fighting in other areas on the Eastern Front has also become increasingly active. There have been reports of fierce battles in the Bryansk area. In addition, German forces are planning to carry out a clearing operation between Ilmen and Leningrad, which is a preliminary step for attacking Leningrad and Kronstadt. This is why the Finnish-German naval base of Kotka was recently heavily bombed by Red Army aircraft, as Kotka is close at hand and a serious threat to Kronstadt.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Alliance News Agency) - According to British sources, the German attack on Sevastopol is becoming more intense. The only good Soviet port on the Black Sea has been reduced to rubble by three weeks of intense artillery fire and bombing. All positions have been reduced to ruins. The Soviet forces are now only holding onto the remaining fortress points and putting up a final stand. According to Moscow broadcasts, German forces, with the cooperation of air, tank, and infantry units, are fiercely attacking the northeastern part of the Soviet positions. Bomb and artillery fire continued throughout the 25th, followed by bayonet fighting with Soviet troops. More elite German reinforcements are arriving continuously, and hundreds of tanks have been mobilized for a fierce attack.</p>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - The German High Command has issued a statement saying that Soviet troops attempting to land on the Kerch Peninsula were discovered before they could land and were forced to retreat by intense German artillery fire.</p>
<p>Moscow, 26th (Havas Dispatch) - TASS has issued a message acknowledging that German pressure on the Red Army in the Kharkov area and on the Sevastopol front is increasing. The Red Army has been forced to "gradually retreat" in the past two days. Since the fall of Kupyansk, the fighting has intensified. The Red Army is still resisting. In addition, the Red Army newspaper "Red Star" also reported that the Axis powers have concentrated a large force in front of the Red Army's new positions in Sevastopol and have launched a fierce attack, breaking through the Red Army's defenses and occupying an important high ground. The German forces attacked this high ground with three infantry battalions, twelve tanks, and an artillery battery, in seven or eight attacks. Hand-to-hand combat has occurred in the central and southern sectors of the port. The German and Romanian forces have also brought in a large number of reinforcements.</p>
<h3>Britain Closely Monitors Spain's Movements; Foreign Minister Serrano Suñer Returns to Madrid</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Alliance News Agency) - The "Yomiuri Shimbun" today published a report from Stockholm stating that London is watching the outcome of Spanish Foreign Minister Serrano Suñer's visit to Rome with deep concern, fearing that the British defeat in Libya may prompt Spain to join the war in support of the Axis powers. Britain is concerned about Spain's future attitude because it understands that Spain's active assistance to the Axis powers would not only toll the death knell for British Mediterranean defenses but would also seriously affect the entire Allied war plan. Britain's concerns are: 1) Spain's entry into the war would be a sign of an Axis attack on Gibraltar. The loss of Gibraltar would paralyze the entire British Mediterranean fleet. 2) Spain's hostility to the Allies would seriously affect or even invalidate the Allied plan to establish a so-called second front in Europe. 3) The French people would be drawn into the European war to help Spain. 4) Spain's entry into the war would allow the Axis powers to take over Fort Capel, the Canary Islands, and the Azores, seriously threatening Allied lines of communication between Britain and Australia.</p>
<p>Paris, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - Spanish Foreign Minister Serrano Suñer passed through here this morning on his way back to Madrid from Rome. The Spanish ambassador and other dignitaries welcomed him at the station. It is said that Serrano Suñer does not intend to stay long and will continue his journey home immediately.</p>

<h3>9 Iraq: Then and Now (Part 2)</h3>
<p>Located on the upper reaches of the Tigris River, at an altitude of eight hundred and twenty [feet], is the famous Mosul oil region. Before World War I, it originally belonged to Turkey. During the European war, it was occupied by the British. After the war, the League of Nations entrusted it to British rule. Later, because Turkey defeated Greece, it held a meeting in Lausanne with the great powers such as Britain, France, and Italy. Turkey proposed that the Mosul province be returned to Turkey. Britain firmly refused, only allowing it to give 25% of the net profit each year. Therefore, Iraq's oil rights have always been controlled by Britain.</p>
<p>Before World War I, Germany had what was called the "Three B Policy." What is the "Three B Policy?" It starts from Berlin, passing through Constantinople (Byzantium) to Baghdad, the capital of Persia, planning to build a Euro-Asian railway. Because these three places all start with the letter "B," it was so named. As a result of the last European war, Germany's rights were naturally stripped away, so the Iraqi oil company was exclusively owned by Britain.</p>
<p>At that time, Russia also had what was called the "Two P Policy," which was to build a railway from Petrograd to the Persian Gulf. But in reality, it was all to enrich the rich oil region. America, the Netherlands, and France could not forget to compete for this rich oil region, and Britain and the Netherlands also wanted to get a piece of the action, causing an international oil war. Finally, in 1930, Britain, America, the Netherlands, France, and other countries formed a large international oil company, mining in the vicinity of Kirkuk. However, although nominally an international joint venture, Britain actually held 40% of the mining rights.</p>
<p>The Great Pipeline</p>
<p>Although Iraq has historically been a transportation hub for the three continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa, it has lost its importance since sea routes opened. But since it possesses rich buried oil resources, transportation has become a major problem. Initially, the oil produced in the Mosul oil region was exported through the Persian Gulf via the Tigris River, through the Red Sea, and then to Europe. However, firstly, the detour was troublesome. Secondly, the siltation at the mouth of the Shatt al-Arab River was too severe, which always felt inconvenient. Thirdly, it was inconvenient for supplying the British Mediterranean fleet. Therefore, someone planned to transport this rich oil directly to the Mediterranean coast. The international oil company formed by Britain, America, France, the Netherlands, and Poland raised capital, and then hired American engineers to design the laying of the pipeline. After seven years of work, this great pipeline project was finally completed on January 21, 1935. It is 1,150 miles long and cost more than ten million dollars. It can be said to be one of the world's great projects.</p>
<p>The laying of this pipeline starts from the Kirkuk oil region to Haditha on the Euphrates River, dividing into two routes: one crosses Iraq and then crosses Syria westward to Tripoli on the Mediterranean coast, and the other crosses the Syrian desert to the southwest, then turns south through Transjordan and enters Palestine, and then reaches Haifa on the Mediterranean coast. Since the completion of this great pipeline project, the company's transportation costs have been greatly reduced, and the total annual output now often reaches more than four million tons.</p>
<p>Vulnerable National Defense</p>
<p>Iraq's national defense, due to its weak national strength, is naturally very vulnerable. According to the 1938 national census, Iraq had a standing army of 28,000 men, and military expenditure was about 1.5 million Dinars, equivalent to about 1.5 million pounds in British currency. All young men between the ages of 19 and 25 have the obligation to serve in the military, adopting the conscription system of modern countries.</p>
<p>Because Iraq has very little contact with the sea, it has no naval defenses, so its national defense is mainly based on the army. Its strength can be divided into: 1) two cavalry regiments; 2) nine field artillery companies; 3) five mountain artillery companies; 4) one mechanized infantry company; 5) one machine gun vehicle company; 6) one signal battalion; 7) one armored car battalion; 8) one engineer battalion; 9) one naval platoon. However, to become a modern country, there must be some air defense, so Iraq has also established an air force for the sake of appearances. Its strength includes: 1) two reconnaissance aircraft squadrons; 2) one bomber squadron; 3) one fighter squadron; 4) one liaison aircraft squadron. This is the strength of Iraq's military.</p>
<p>However, in order to protect its oil interests, Britain has military bases in Iraq. The headquarters of the Air Force is located fifty miles northwest of Baghdad, the capital of Iraq. It cost 50 million pounds to open a large amphibious airfield, stationed with hundreds of aircraft, and also has heavy troops stationed in Iraq. In the north, the Soviet Union also has corresponding air and ground forces stationed in the Caucasus, threatening Iraq.</p>
<p>Baghdad is located in the middle reaches of the Tigris River, on the main route of land and water transportation. It is the capital of Iraq and a gathering place for caravan trade, with a population of about 350,000. The telegraph line between Europe and India passes through Aleppo from here. During World War I, Britain and Turkey fought fiercely here. During the heyday of Islam, the Caliph used this as a base. It was the old capital of the Saracen Empire and the center of Arab scholarship. Today, the Ministry of National Defense of the Iraqi government is located at the north gate of Baghdad, using the former headquarters of Turkey as its troop garrison.</p>

<p>It will meet with the Asama Maru, which is evacuating emigrants from Yokohama, and will not call at any other port. It is scheduled to arrive in Mombasa, East Africa, on the 11th of next month. The Gripsholm, which is carrying Japanese officials and civilians who are evacuating from the United States and Latin America, will arrive a few days later, around July 15th, because it has to detour around Cape Horn, South America. Then the exchange of officials and civilians can take place. The Japanese officials and civilians, about</p>
<p>One Thousand Five Hundred</p>
<p>will be carried back to Japan by the Conte Verde and Asama Maru, without calling at Shanghai again.

<h3>Regulations for Pawnshops in the French Concession May be Amended</h3>
<p>All pawnshops in the French Concession, because of the management regulations issued by the French Consulate General, were about to violate the law in every move. In desperation, all pawnshops stopped redeeming goods. Later, the guild persuaded them to resume business first, and the guild submitted a request to the French Municipal Council for a change. The French Municipal Council also convened representatives of the industry for a discussion. The result was satisfactory, and a change may be possible. A definite announcement may be made in the next day or two.</p>
<h3>Round-Trip Passes Will Soon be Discontinued</h3>
<p>The two concessions in this city issued two types of passes, temporary round-trip passes and return-to-hometown passes, to facilitate citizens leaving Shanghai. Now that citizen identity cards are about to be issued on a general basis, the French Concession police have already stopped issuing temporary passes a few days ago. For citizens returning to their hometowns, the French Concession Paochia General Office still issues return-to-hometown passes. As for the Public Concession, according to inquiries by reporters, it is said that it will also stop issuing temporary passes starting from July 1st, and all temporary passes issued before will also become invalid from that day. However, the issuance of return-to-hometown passes will continue.</p>
<h3>Retirement of Mr. Lang, Secretary of the Consular Body</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that Mr. Lang, secretary of the Shanghai Consular Body and the Consular Court, is retiring after serving for fourteen years. He will leave Shanghai on the Conte Verde with his daughter on Monday to return to the United States. When the reporter met Mr. Lang yesterday (the 26th), he introduced Mr. Iizuka, who had recently arrived from Tokyo, as his successor. It is said that Iizuka has served as Vice Consul in Honolulu, Singapore, Los Angeles, and Guangzhou. The Danish Consul General and leader of the Consular Body, Mr. Hill, who left Shanghai on Saturday, hosted Mr. Lang at his residence and presented him with a silver plate with an inscription. Other Consuls of the Consular Body also attended. Mr. Lang's daughter recently received special permission from the Japanese authorities to come to Shanghai from Manila to await repatriation. Mr. Lang was very grateful for this. Mr. Lang first came to Shanghai in 1927 and worked at the American Consulate. The following year, he was appointed Secretary of the Consular Body and the Consular Court and has remained in that position until now. Mr. Lang has long wanted to write a book on the Shanghai Consular Body to record the work of the officials of the consulates, but he has not had the opportunity. If he comes to Shanghai again in the future, he hopes that this idea can be realized.</p>

The plot is extremely moving. The section is currently launching a campaign to find families for unfortunate children in Shanghai, hoping that people in society will cooperate.

<h3>The Wang Jinxiu Zhai Jewelry Store Homicide on Avenue Joffre; Boy Strangled to Death, Girl Seriously Injured; Two Apprentices Suspected of Being Involved</h3>
<p>Wang Jinxiu Zhai Gold and Silver Jewelry Store at No. 21 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, which used to be located in the Old City God Temple, had a thriving business. After the war, it moved to the above location to continue its business.</p>
<p>The Girl Has Reached the Age of [Hairpin Ceremony] and is Beautiful</p>
<p>The owner of the store, Wang Weiyi, is a local. He went to Suzhou two days ago to purchase goods. His family lives upstairs. Wang has one son and one daughter. The boy, Wang Mianwu, is only five years old, and the girl, Wang Huide, has reached the age of [hairpin ceremony] and is beautiful. Recently, they have been staying at Wang's place and sleeping in the small room on the second floor. Yesterday morning, an apprentice named Zhu Mincai, 17 years old from Jiading, took a lunch basket to the room to get rice. Unexpectedly, he discovered blood splattered all over the bed, and the bedding was filled with a disgusting, fishy smell. Upon closer inspection, both the boy and the girl had been stabbed in the head, face, waist, and abdomen with a knife. Wang Mianwu was dead and his neck had a towel wrapped around it, suggesting he was strangled. The seriously injured girl, Qu Huide, was also lying on the bed in a pool of blood and was unable to speak.</p>
<p>Young Apprentices Suspected of Being Involved</p>
<p>The police were immediately notified and arrived at the scene. The injured girl was rushed to the hospital for treatment. The dead boy's body was taken to the morgue for examination. After investigation, the police believed that another apprentice, Pu Minxing, 17 years old from Wuxi, and Qu Minding, 20 years old from this city, were highly suspected and were immediately taken to the police station for questioning. It is believed that this perplexing homicide will soon be resolved. The police are currently investigating the case.</p>
<h3>Bureau Rice Distribution Ends on July 4th</h3>
<p>According to a Datong News Agency reporter, the issuance of rice purchase certificates in the two concessions is still continuing. Except for today, Sunday, it is scheduled to be issued until July 4th. The 5th will be a preparation period, and formal grain distribution will begin on the 6th.</p>
<h3>YMCA Holds Health and Nutrition Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA holds public health exhibitions every summer to promote health knowledge and reduce disease. The YMCA believes that due to inflation, common people have lost their way in nutrition and general food intake, that they are only considering what is cheap. This affects their health and their chances of getting sick. This exhibition will focus on the nutrition in food, what are the important nutritional components, and how they are not just in meat. It will also point out what vegetables have good vitamin content. This is scheduled to begin on June 29th and run until July 1st, at the Y.M.C.A. on Ba Xian Qiao 8, in the second floor where all kinds of charts and models will be on display. It will be open 10AM to 6PM and free of charge.</p>
<h3>News from the Cheng Zheng and Ge Zhi Societies</h3>

<h3>Public Works Department Announcement: Issuance of Scrip is Prohibited from Today; Scrip Already Issued Must be Recalled by the Beginning of Next Month and Cannot be Forced to be Used to Purchase Goods</h3>
<p>The Information Office of the Public Works Department announces: This Bureau has recently issued Proclamation No. 5970, which stipulates that the issuance of scrip within the Concession is prohibited from the 28th of this month, and all companies are ordered to recall all scrip issued previously by July 10th. The proclamation clearly stipulates that scrip should be redeemed with cash and cannot be forced to be used to purchase goods. Any company found to be issuing scrip after July 11th will be severely punished. It has been found that a large number of stores, dance halls, etc., are using the excuse of difficulty in making change to issue scrip without approval and are using goods as a substitute for cash when redeeming the scrip instead of paying a fine. This not only hinders the circulation of currency but also increases the burden on citizens' purchases. At present, there are already sufficient subsidiary currency notes in the city, so there is no need for the issuance of scrip. Citizens who discover that any company is issuing scrip after July 11th are requested to report it to the police in writing so that it can be investigated and dealt with.</p>

<h3>Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund, Regulations Have Been Revised, Donations Are Purely Voluntary and Never Solicited</h3>
<p>Since the launch of the third Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund campaign, it has received enthusiastic responses from all parties. Letters from all walks of life have been continuously received with enthusiastic support. Yesterday, the Progressive Students' Association also sent a letter with practical suggestions, and the Sino-Japanese Language Institute donated 20 half-fee scholarships. Their letters are recorded below.</p>
<p>Letter from the Progressive Students' Association contributing opinions: "Having read the Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Supplement, we are very impressed. We, colleagues, regard it as a noble duty to promote human mutual assistance, and are willing to donate according to our ability, and at any time and place solicit donations from elders, relatives, friends, shop owners, etc., so as to accumulate a little bit to make a large amount, which we believe will be approved by the public. We also hope that all sectors will have the same aspirations and donate according to their ability, then thousands of out-of-school youths will be grateful without end. This is our humble opinion, and we hope it will be considered." The kindness of the gentlemen of the Association is deeply admired by us. However, the solicitation of donations for the Shen Bao Scholarship Fund is entirely based on voluntary donations from people from all walks of life, and has never been solicited from the outside world. This is something that must be reiterated to all sectors.</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese Language Institute Donates Scholarships: Letter from the Sino-Japanese Language Institute at 34 Foch Road, South of the Old City God Temple Market: "To whom it may concern, our institute has specially set up 20 half-fee places for poor scholars to study Japanese. Anyone recommended by your newspaper will be approved by our institute in order to serve the purpose of serving the society and cultivate Japanese talents. We hope that your newspaper will recommend them on our behalf. Sincerely yours, Dean of Studies Wen Niaowu Xiong. (Note) Please recommend students to the school before July 10th for placement in various grades."</p>
<p>Revised Regulations of the Scholarship Fund: The regulations of the Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund are hereby revised as follows: (Article 1) The Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund is established in the spirit of human mutual assistance to subsidize outstanding young students in primary, secondary, and higher education who are eager to pursue further studies. (Article 2) Orphans, as well as those from poor families who are indeed unable to continue their studies and whose academic performance in major subjects is above 80 points and whose overall average is above 70 points, and whose conduct is rated B or above, and are recommended by the school authorities, or other credible proof, and are deemed qualified by this newspaper through review or examination, may enjoy subsidies in accordance with these regulations. (However, the primary school part must be after the end of the fourth academic year before requesting assistance.) (Article 3) The procedures for applying for scholarships are as follows: (1) Obtain an application form from this office, fill it out in detail in your own handwriting in accordance with the items listed on the form, and affix two and a half-inch half-length photos. (2) Submit the school report card for the most recent semester, as well as other documents such as certificates and awards that prove their excellent academic performance. (3) In addition to being signed by the applicant student, the end of the application form should also be signed and sealed by the parent or guardian and the school principal. (4) Industrial and commercial employees who apply to enter a supplementary school for further studies must have a transcript and a letter of certification from the service business with the seal of the business and obtain the admission certificate to be qualified. (Article 4) The amount of the scholarship applied for should be filled in by the applicant, but must be accompanied by the school's fee schedule to prove the authenticity of the amount. However, regardless of universities, vocational schools, primary and secondary schools, and supplementary schools, the application for tuition fees is the principle. In special circumstances, miscellaneous fees and book fees prescribed in the school fee schedule may also be applied for, but the review may still be handled at the discretion of the circumstances. (Article 5) The date for applying for scholarships each semester will be announced temporarily in January and July of each year according to the prescribed academic qualifications.

(Article 9) The number of scholarships to be awarded may be determined in light of the economic situation.

(Article 10) This office may send personnel to investigate the academic performance of young people who enjoy scholarships from this office, or send letters to invite them to visit the office for an interview. (Article 11) Those who receive scholarships should repay the scholarships in one lump sum or in installments when their parents or themselves have the ability to repay, so as to help others. However, those who donate according to their ability are even more welcome. (Article 12) These regulations may be revised at any time if they are not perfect. (Revised in June 1942)</p>

<p>Family</p>
<h3>Three Things Worth Promoting</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>We would like to specially propose the following three things, which we believe are closely related to the family, and we ask readers to pay attention to and promote them.</p>
<p>Youth Association Holds Health and Nutrition Exhibition</p>
<p>The Youth Association holds health campaigns every summer to publicize health knowledge. The holding of such exhibitions undoubtedly makes a great contribution to society, because if we can know more about health knowledge, we can not only protect the health of ourselves and our families, but also promote the health of the entire society.</p>
<p>This year's health campaign has one more characteristic, that is, it particularly emphasizes nutritional knowledge, so that the common people can also enjoy the nutrition they need. From tomorrow until July 1, on the second floor of the Baxianqiao Clubhouse, in addition to displaying various charts, models, specimens, and articles, there will also be performances. It is open from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM every day, and there is no admission fee. Since we have this rare opportunity, it is indeed worth visiting.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Wenyan's Savings for Assistance</p>
<p>The scholarship fund organized by this newspaper had very good results the first time, and the second time is now underway. In this newspaper on June 26, there was a news item that Mr. Zhou Wenyan sent 1,000 yuan of his savings from his usual zero-deposit fixed savings, which was converted into 500 yuan of savings certificates, to this newspaper as a reader's scholarship fund. This kind of action is really admirable. Mr. Zhou is able to help other hardworking young people with his private savings after feeling fortunate to have been cultivated by his parents. He can indeed be called a model of modern youth. From this, we can also know that Mr. Zhou's parents have cultivated him well, which is worthy of our admiration. There is no shortage of young people in society who are in a similar situation to Mr. Zhou. After reading this news, they will definitely respond in droves and enthusiastically help with scholarships.</p>
<p>Health Care Movement</p>
<p>Health is needed by everyone, especially at a time like now. We must have a strong physique in order to cope with all difficulties and overcome the threats of life with an inspiring, promising, and indomitable spirit.</p>
<p>If we want to achieve this goal, we must pay attention to exercise, because the importance of exercise is really no different from sunshine, air, and diet. Without exercise, there is no way to ensure health. So-called exercise does not necessarily require going to a gym. As long as you have perseverance, and the method of practice is simple and effective. Now the Japanese journal has begun to publish the Mr. Health Care Exercise Method; the health of the body will undoubtedly be guaranteed. If we want to enjoy personal and family health and happiness, we hope that readers and their entire family, parents, children, will all study and practice this new method of exercise that is worth studying.</p>
<h3>Weaning Infants Should Not Be Done Arbitrarily</h3>
<p>— Mao Ren</p>
<p>Recently, most mothers have become nervous when dealing with infants. When the child's stool turns green, they think it is athlete's foot; if the child vomits milk, they think the milk is not suitable. Because of this reason, they do not formally review it from a medical standpoint, and they wean the child. However, the mother's milk is really a good and appropriate food for the child. It should be provided to the child by proper methods as much as possible. It can also be said that it is the first step to make the child have a healthy physique for life. When the child is eating the mother's milk, even if the stool is slightly greenish, the mother does not have to worry anxiously. If you are really worried, you can take the child to an infant health care hospital or a specialist doctor for a consultation. If a mother who does not understand medical principles treats her child indiscriminately because she loves him too much, she may even lose the child's health.</p>
<h3>Comparison of Several Kinds of Rice</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Our main food is rice, but there are many kinds of rice. Now, we have specially invited Dr. Hou Xiangchuan of the Physiological Science Group of the Shanghai Lester Institute for Medical Research to list the nutritional components of various kinds of rice for readers' reference:</p>
<p>No. 1 White Rice, Brown Rice, Indica Rice, Corn, Millet, White Sorghum Rice, Red Sorghum Moisture 12.25, 13.99, 13.78, 9.6, 10.02, 16.14, 13.27 Protein 7.29, 6.68, 7.12, 12.7, 9.27, 5.67, 6.94 Fat 0.46, 0.35, 0.26, 7.3, 3.15, 2.26, 4.64 Carbohydrates 79.16, 74.98, 77.40, 68.4, 75.71, 74.03, 71.98 Calories per 100 Cubic Centimeters 358, 338, 349, 350, 377, 348, 328 Calcium 0.05, 0.06, 0.06, 0.006, 0.14, 0.04, 0.17 Iron 0.02, 0.05, 0.001, 0.009, 0.007, 0.009, 0.028 Vitamin A 0, 10, 0, 11, 10 Vitamin B 0, 10 Vitamin C 0, 0, 0 Vitamin D 11 Vitamin E 0, 10 Vitamin F 0, 10, 0, 11, 10</p>
<p>According to the above comparison, corn has the best nutrition, followed by millet and brown rice, then sorghum and rice, and finally indica rice. In order to take care of the nutritional needs, several kinds of rice can be eaten together, or they can be changed from time to time.</p>
<p>Friend of Children</p>
<h3>Children, Pay Attention</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>This issue of this magazine is a special issue on health and nutrition. Children can refer to the articles published in this magazine in many places. For example, from now on, we should not eat snacks in our spare time, because eating snacks is not hygienic.</p>
<p>At the same time, when eating, we should no longer pick fish and meat and leave vegetables uneaten, because there are many nutrients in vegetables, which are better than fish and meat.</p>
<p>There is also one point. From this issue onwards, we will publish the Health Care Exercise Method on a regular basis. Children can also learn it every time, so that soon, those of us who are weak can become strong, and those who are already strong can become even stronger. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.</p>
<h3>Family Maxims</h3>
<p>· An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.</p>
<p>· A sharp mind resides in a sound body.</p>
<p>· Disease enters through the mouth, so be careful what you eat, otherwise the disease will worsen.</p>
<p>· If speech is restrained, there will be fewer mistakes; if actions are restrained, there will be fewer regrets; if diet is restrained, there will be fewer diseases; if joy is restrained, there will be fewer disasters.</p>
<p>· Wine, sex, gambling, and fraud hurt the body and ruin the family, property decreases day by day, and hobbies increase day by day.</p>
<p>· Early to bed and early to rise, thoughts are sharp, the body is healthy, and food and clothing are prepared.</p>
<h3>Household Matters</h3>
<p>— Wang Lemin</p>
<p>When boiling eggs, add a little edible salt to the water, then the boiled eggs will be easier to peel and taste better.</p>
<p>Freshly inserted flowers are easily withered. If you split the end of the stem and insert edible salt</p>
<h3>Twelve Major Slogans of the Youth Association's Nutrition Campaign</h3>
<p>Eating is to make the body get nutrition and increase health.</p>
<p>Food is not about eating a lot, but should pay attention to the nutritional content.</p>
<p>It is better to eat nutritious foods than to eat supplements.</p>
<p>If you know the method of nutrition, the patient can turn from weak to strong.</p>
<p>Eating vegetarian food is not only more economical but also more nourishing.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the freshness of the side dishes you buy.</p>
<p>During the summer vacation, food should focus on cleanliness and strictly prevent flies.</p>
<p>Please everyone get up and study the nutritional content of food.</p>
<p>Eating should be regular and avoid eating too much.</p>
<p>The rich are easy to pay attention to nutrition, and the poor can also pay attention to nutrition.</p>
<p>Food should be chewed slowly, because the combination of saliva and food is the beginning of digestion.</p>
<p>Avoid eating snacks when you are idle, otherwise it will hinder digestion and development. Then tie it tightly with a string, and then insert it into a bottle and add 80% water, which can last longer.</p>
<p>When bathing, the glass mirror is always obscured by thick soda water, which is very inconvenient; if you first wipe a thin layer of soap on the mirror, and then wipe it with a soft cloth until it is as bright as before; in this way, even if there is extremely thick soda water in the room, the mirror will still be clear as usual.</p>
<h3>Small Fun</h3>
<p>— Yushan Chengmin</p>
<p>After the schools are closed for the holidays, children may wish to do these arithmetic problems carefully in addition to reviewing their lessons at home. They will definitely find it very interesting.</p>
<p>I think there must be some children who often ask their parents how long it will take to fill the abacus with thirteen blocks of beads, one by one, with one carried over every ten? At first glance, it seems that it can be filled in a while, but in fact it is not that easy.</p>
<p>If you calculate at 150 abacus beads per minute, it will take 211,398 years, 7 months, 13 days, 19 hours, 51 minutes and 6 seconds to fill a thirteen-block abacus. If the average person can live to eighty years old, it will take 2,643 generations to pass it on before the last person fills an abacus at the age of thirty-eight years, seven months, thirteen days, nineteen hours, fifty-one minutes and six seconds; however, the time for sleeping and other times must also be included. Children, isn't this an amazing number? (Remittance to help loan scholarship)</p>
<h3>Outside the Three Hundred and Sixty Industries</h3>
<p>— Xingye</p>
<p>Three young people in Chicago, USA, founded a new business, replacing others' memory dates. This is a profession outside of the three hundred and sixty industries. Forgetful or busy people can make a contract with them to have them remember birthdays, wedding days, appointments, and other important dates. Then, on the appropriate date, they will notify you by phone or in writing. The fee is US$1.50 per year for eight dates. Their office is not large. There is a small window against the wall where they make appointments with customers. On the wall hangs a calendar. According to the recorded dates, they are busy making phone calls every day to report to regular customers.</p>
<h3>Work</h3>
<p>— Tianye</p>
<p>To make yourself do more work, this can be used as a kind of stimulation to use your talents as much as possible.</p>
<p>Do more than others expect of you! If your colleagues are lazy, you can help them and learn a little more. If you complain about them or try to be even lazier than them, then you are hurting yourself. Organize your work, and you can have a certain goal. The list of winners of the Family Weekly Small Arithmetic Problems is published in the classified column on page 8 of this newspaper, and the remaining balance will be published next Sunday. Please pay attention, children.</p>
<h3>One Week's Family Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Huaying</p>
<p>These past few days, going to the market, all the housewives are sighing and complaining to each other, saying that they brought ten yuan of the new legal tender, but can't buy much to take back. Fish and meat go without saying, but even vegetables and melons have all risen sharply, and the vegetable vendors don't calculate the ratio of new to old legal tender at 1:2. Moreover, some even exceed the original prices of the old legal tender. If this continues, how can people maintain the seven daily necessities? Now, the authorities are strictly suppressing prices and there's talk of controlling vegetable prices. This is truly the most urgent task at hand, and we hope it will be implemented soon.</p>

<p>Why does "Health Exercise" have such an effect? According to the inventor, the famous American hygiene expert McGowan, it uses the position of lying flat on the body, with the least amount of labor, to do various exercises to promote the strengthening of the abdominal muscles, thereby making the digestive system, excretory system, and blood circulation work in an orderly manner and function properly. With this kind of natural physical strength, there is no fear of disease invasion, and so-called indigestion, anemia, constipation, insomnia and all weakening phenomena disappear into nothingness.</p>

In order to enable readers and their families to enjoy health and happiness, this magazine specially introduces it to readers with twelve points of sincerity.

<h3>Government Bond Trends Not Yet Stable, But There Are Also Those Taking Advantage of Low Prices to Absorb</h3>
<p>Yesterday's government bond gray market saw unstable public sentiment, with many floating positions continuing to be closed out, and market prices continuing to weaken. At the same time, there were also many covering short positions, and a few taking advantage of the low prices to absorb. The trend was no longer as severe as the previous day's decline. During this eventful period, a sudden surge in the bond market is probably not yet the time. However, there is absolutely no fundamental problem. When the market first opened yesterday, the opening prices of each bond were still stable. The opening price for Class B was 38 yuan, which was higher than the closing price from the previous day. Afterwards, due to the outflow of floating positions, the market gradually weakened, but then recovered after falling to a low, and the closing price was several points higher than the lowest price. After this stimulation, the market situation is not easy to stabilize for a while. Because the benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom, and everyone's concepts are different. As a result, the market price continued to decline by 7 jiao to 1.4 yuan, with a turnover of more than 2 million yuan. A concise table is listed below: Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day Unified Class A 40.70 39.80 0. Falling 0.7 Unified Class B 38.00 36.0 36.0 Also 1.30 Unified Class C 37.20 36.0 36.70 Also 0.90 Unified Class D 37.0 32.5 32.10 Also 1.4 Unified Class E 35.0 33.4 33.5 Also 1.3</p>
<h3>Chinese Stock Investment Still Booming</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks continued to fall at first, but suddenly rose back up at noon, as investment buyers were active at low prices. The new medicine industry rebounded sharply, the department store industry trended steadily in a roundabout way, financial stocks and the textile industry had few transactions and stable prices, and the industrial stocks were firm and the supply of chips felt depleted again. The prices for each category are recorded below: Category Highest Lowest Lasting New Asia New 42.50 38.00 42.00 Sino-French New 75.00 72.50 72.50 Minyi 75.00 70.00 70.00 Underwear 32.00 29.00 31.50 Wing On - 90.00 95.00 Sincere 105.00 97.50 100.00 Commercial Press - 290.00 China 200.00 190.00 195.00 World 135.00 - 130.00 Nanyang Tobacco 72.50 70.00 72.50 Greater China 200.00 190.00 195.00 Zhabei Water and Electricity 33.00 31.00 33.00 Huashang Water and Electricity 29.00 26.50 29.00</p>
<h3>Foreign Stocks Turned Flat from Weak</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks turned flat from weak in light trading. China Textiles rose from 39 yuan back to 40 yuan before small amounts of sales were seen. Ewo Silk Mill was quoted at 41.5 yuan, and sales were made at 43 yuan at noon. Jardine 37 yuan, Shanghai Worsted 16 yuan, British-American Tobacco 33 yuan. Unspecified Central Reserve Bank checks.</p>
<h3>Regulations for Payment Methods</h3>
<p>The Provisional Joint Association of Banks and Money Shops in this city yesterday issued a circular to various banks and shops, stating that many difficulties were encountered when paying checks opened by old legal tender depositors of various banks and money shops that had not been marked with Central Reserve Bank notes on the face of the check. Therefore, three measures were agreed upon as follows:</p>
<p>Checks that expired before the deadline of June 21 for the exchange of old legal tender but have not yet been cashed will be converted to Central Reserve Bank notes at a rate of two to one.</p>
<p>Checks issued before the deadline of June 21 for the exchange of old legal tender that expire before June 25 will be converted to Central Reserve Bank notes at a rate of two to one according to the face value of the check. Checks that expire after June 24 will be paid in Central Reserve Bank notes according to the face value of the check (however, when there is doubt, payment may be made after contacting the issuer).</p>
<p>Checks issued from the date of June 25 when the use of old legal tender was discontinued will be paid in Central Reserve Bank notes according to the face value of the check.</p>

Also, starting from July 1 of this year, the committee's lending rate will be changed to 3 jiao per thousand yuan per day.</p>
<h3>Soybean Trading Watching</h3>
<p>Soybean trading was still light yesterday, mainly because there were many rumors and people were all watching. The unified market only had small households on this street handle ten packages of Tianjin red beans, priced at 167 yuan. Chongming sand 95 packages priced at 102 yuan to 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Soybean Cake Demand Quiet</h3>
<p>The soybean cake storage is quiet, only scattered households in nearby villages have a little bit. The price is seen to fall by one or two yuan. It is estimated that 500 pieces of Fengji soybean cake, new goods in May, are priced at 53.5 yuan; 500 pieces of livestock inquiry soybean cake, old goods in June, are priced at 45 yuan; 500 pieces of new goods in February, are priced at 49 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sweet Potato Dry Also Returned Small</h3>
<p>Sweet potato dry is about to be realized due to the plan of rationing food, and rice prices are relaxing, resulting in a virtual and soft market and prices showing fatigue. It is estimated that 50 packages of sweet potato dry from Jiangbei are priced at 118 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Shares Slightly Loose</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar shares of the cooperative business place were still not quiet in terms of entry and exit. The trend was tight at first and then loose. The opening price of crude white shares was 313 yuan and 5 jiao, with the minimum reaching 09 yuan and 5 jiao. Later, due to more entries, it rose back to 312 yuan, a drop of one yuan compared to the previous (25th). The idle market for red sugar shares was still 300 yuan, closing at 298 yuan, a drop of 2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Black Dates Price Still Upside Down</h3>
<p>Black dates are slightly looser due to the recent opening of some Tianjin gang numbers, and ordinary goods have recovered slightly, rising and falling between 10 and 20 yuan. However, according to Nanjing telegram inquiries, the price is still high and still upside down. It is difficult to loosen the market in the future. In addition, the Taiwan gang has resumed procurement recently, and the market is stable and less volatile.</p>
<h3>Hardware Stored Households Seeking Sales</h3>
<p>Hardware transactions are very rare, but the market price of each product has risen sharply. The only reason is that the source of goods is cut off and there is insufficient inventory. However, since yesterday, due to the saying that the authorities will control the prices of various industries, the stored households have tried their best to sell, resulting in a return in goods prices and less frequent transactions. At the moment, 40-foot bamboo joint steel bars are selling for 9,000 yuan per ton, a drop of 1,000 yuan from before; 2.5 to 7.5 centimeters of new steel plates are 12,000 yuan per ton; 1 to thick patterned colors are 13,000 yuan, all falling by around 1,000 yuan compared to before. New foreign yuan, new foreign square, and new foreign plates are 10,000 yuan per ton; foreign yuan head, foreign square head, and foreign plate head are 9,000 yuan per ton, all recovering around 1,000 yuan compared to before. New angle steel is 1,000 yuan, and head goods are 9,000 yuan, also falling by about 1,000 yuan. American Huisz steel is 1,800 yuan per box, a drop of 200 yuan compared to before; 200 pounds of American strip iron are 1,400 yuan per box, recovering 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Daily Necessities Controlled Rumors Abound</h3>
<p>The declining trend of daily necessities is getting stronger and stronger. In the midst of the rumors of controlled price limits, people's hearts are getting more and more empty, and both buying and selling are lonely. Yesterday, Phoenix brand matches opened at 2,500 yuan, Beautiful brand at 2,650 yuan, miscellaneous brands at 2,000 yuan, Gubben soap at 290 yuan, Bai Xiangmao soap at 240 yuan, Huang Xiang soap at 190 yuan, scissor soap at 240 yuan, Bai Li's foreign candles at 120 yuan, monk hat brand at 115 yuan, miscellaneous brands at 90 yuan, all of which were severely reduced compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes Lack Visitors</h3>
<p>Cigarette trading is as quiet as ever. Lower-grade brands are still selling well, but the rest are rarely visited. The market continues to decline. Yesterday, the opening prices were: Great Britain brand 8,100 yuan, Old Knife brand 5,300 yuan, Pinhai brand 4,500 yuan, Fairy brand 3,700 yuan, and Wuhua brand 3,500 yuan, all of which were down by 2-300 yuan compared to the previous day. Japanese-style golden gun brand sales are more active, but prices are also difficult to rise. The opening price is still 2-30 yuan lower than the previous day, with a price of 1,4450 yuan per box. Furthermore, Jin Dalou is 2,200 yuan, Red Rose brand is 1,325 yuan, Quanlu brand is 1, 340 yuan, Zhi Nan brand is 1,400 yuan, National Smoke Golden Mouse brand is 1,800 yuan, and Beautiful brand is 3,150 yuan. All of these lack active trading and present a picture of a market with prices but no sales.</p>
