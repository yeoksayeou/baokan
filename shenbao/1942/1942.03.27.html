<h3>印度半島禮記（四）</h3>
<p>淸晨火車停靠站上時，男女都到月台附近的水管邊去洗澡。有一次我們在車窗口見一男人通身洗澡。他先伸出一條手臂完全洗過，於是再洗大腿，這樣地完全洗擦了一下，全身洗好，只有一小盆的水！</p>
<p>千變萬化的的圖畫在眼前掠過；衣杉襤褸的人睡着縮做一團，等待明天朝晨的火車；紅布包頭的脚伕　踞在一條綫上，只要費一個阿那（二分）就可給你拿八十磅重的什錦行李；要等到車靠站頭，才可攀緣上另外一輛餐車，立刻要狼呑虎嚥把咖啡呷完，趕回到後面的車廂中；頭等車特別舒適，有供私人用的雨淋浴設備以及很多的雷風扇；車上不供被褥，必須自帶舖蓋；塵埃無孔不入……</p>
<p>我們抵巴羅達時已很侷促，在大禮廳中安置鏡箱燈光等件後，儀式即將開始。</p>
<p>君主坐在金色寳座上，頭戴王冠，上面鑲嵌寳石飾針，接受人民的慶祝。後面站了二名很威嚴的衛兵，手屯執有金色鎚矛，太子站在他的右面，戴一綴着不少翡翠的頭圈。巴羅達王公的裝飾有眩目的寶石，一個翡翠胸針，頭布上面　了羽毛翎。</p>
<p>儀式共歷一小時，其中有一節目是人民獻穀給君主，他把一小部份穀仍還給贈與人。廳中的一個角落有歌女舞蹈，以娛嘉賓。</p>
<p>紙鳶和壘球</p>
<p>下午，君主和他的長子陪我們在廳後的大花園中散步。把攝影用具自覲見廳搬到花園中，足有半哩路。年輕的太子同我們討論棍球和紙鳶的游戲，由談論中我們知道他對於壘球亦很歡喜。</p>
<p>我們看到幾樣國寳，其中有一樣是實心金砲，重二百八十磅（價値十一萬七千六百美元）和一輛金銀合鑄的馬車，樣式很美觀。每遇隆重儀式時，就要陳列出來，前者還用二頭乳白的牛拖運。</p>
<p>我們想赴鄰近沙漠的城市比加尼爾去，有二個理由。第一，王公的太孫珈尼聘鄧家坡的公主為室，我們要去攝取訂婚禮節。在我們西方人眼光中，這種儀節是罕見的。但是更其柬要的還有一次結婚禮節可以參觀，那是比加尼爾王公的孫女嬪於遠達坡的皇太子，遠達坡城建立極古，遠在耶穌紀元之前。這次結婚計劃已有一年之久，日期約在珈尼的訂婚禮後六星期，可算印度近年來難逢的偉大儀式。</p>
<p>次日淸晨，離巴羅逹，我們即橫渡沙漠去比加尼爾城。火車過了二站，車門上有叩門的聲音，接着跑來一個制服整齊的侍者。</p>
<p>「王公陛下特命送上早餐」，他說：「先生歡喜那一種？</p>
<p>一切都可隨我們之所好！柏傑（即著者戴氏之夫人）永遠像餓狼似地，要燕麥粥，麵包吐司和咖啡；洛萊還是睡眼惺忪，懶洋洋地表示同意。因此一頓豐美的早餐，已經煮就送來。</p>
<p>車抵下一站，侍者又來。我們還要吃些什麼？決定是火腿與鶏蛋。這一次因爲食物要在車站上燒就，所以火車特地停了片刻。</p>
<p>到比加尼爾車站，王公的英印代表都赴車站歡迎，我們即由衛隊護送到會客廳。</p>
<p>經過軍隊列道的市街，遇到不少有趣的行列，前面是一個騎駝駱的鼓手，後面接着是二名騎馬鼓手，軍樂隊，和一隊步兵。一頭雄壯的裝配齊全的象，前面有不少人手託訂婚的禮物，盛在遮好的銀盤中，後面有不少馬車，載了許多貴賓在內。他們正在到王宮中去，參加訂婚大典。</p>

<h3>聖心醫院參觀記</h3>
<p>一個爲貧苦兒童謀福利的天堂</p>
<p>誰都不該忘記的吧！聖心醫院在戰前是中國數一數二設備最完全救人最多的醫院。它的鋪錠療法，對於我國醫學界曾有過驚人的貢獻。之後，爲着環境關係，經過了許多挫折，才從楊樹浦寗國路原址遷至現在的祈齊路上，可是一些愛熱鬧，花天酒地的上海人，怕已忘懷它了吧！</p>
<p>三層樓洋房，紅色的圍牆，環繞的樹木，鐵門邊二塊瓷牌，上面有四個金字，這就是「聖心翳院」。那里，是籠罩在寗靜的氛氣下，雖然，和外面僅僅是一牆之隔，我却感到彷彿是兩個世界似的，在綠的草地上，我看見幾個病人在散步，也有蹲着在研究什麽。向一個門房說明了來意後，便由一位天主敎的修女來接見，她白的服裝，正象微着她心田的純潔，那份和藹，竟使我有一見如故的感覺，原來她姓沈一－沈姆姆。</p>
<p>「貴院近况怎麽樣？」我凑上去，急急地問她。</p>
<p>「敝院有五十只床位，但想到住院的以外，外面貧苦的病人更不知有多少，所以每日上午另設門診掛號祗收手續費六角，並設有免費診，這也是希望窮人也能享受些人的健康和幸福。」沈姆姆緩緩地說。在她的臉上，有的是同情，慈，愛和熱情。</p>
<p>「貴院救濟精神眞偉大！」這是我心里的話，因此不禁毫不思索地說了出來。「有幾位醫生和護士？」</p>
<p>「主任醫師是張亮惠醫學博士，另外有英法籍護士長和護士及護士生等五十多個。」</p>
<p>接着，她陪我去參觀病室，有三元一天的普通間，有五元一天的二等間，最使我感到興趣的是「小兒室」。那些天眞爛漫的小天使們正圍坐在小桌子旁玩木鴨呀！木象呀！木卡車呀！六面畫呀！兩邊平行地排列着的是十九只小搖床，小便盆和小椅放在它下面，床和床的中間，却隔第一　茶几。看見我們時，他們都親切地叫「姆媽！」一個小女孩還爭先抱住沈姆姆的膝頭。沈姆姆吿訴我這些都是遭父母遺棄了的孤兒，那個抱住她的女孩已經六歲了。當她二歲還不滿二尺長時，患了佝僂病，根本就不會站立和談話的。父母斷定她是個怪物，把她送了來，但經過張醫生一年多的治療，終於醫好了。</p>
<p>「你看，她多活潑！」沈姆姆有着得意的神色。</p>
<p>「最近沈姆姆還收養孤兒嗎？」</p>
<p>「本預備收的，可是爲經費的困難和近來代乳品的缺乏，也只好暫時作罷了。就是撫養已經在這　的孤兒，都還覺得非常吃力！」一片愁雲飛上她的慈愛的臉上。是的她爲這些可憐的孤兒們愁憐，爲許多得不到她恩惠的孤兒們憂慮，更為苦難的中國苦兄們悲哀！</p>
<p>「那些比較大的呢？」</p>
<p>「孩子們在上了十歲後，便由我們送到濟南去撫養，那里有一所規校很大的孤兒院，專門承收各處苦兒的。除敎導撫育，識字外，男的得學會一種技藝，女的學習女紅，都有一技之長。每年總有幾百對孤兒，配成夫妻去成家立業」。</p>
<p>時候已是十一點半了！女僕端了飯菜授給孩子們。每個都有二色菜？鮮魚和蘿葡。一個白衣天使更拿了一瓶魚肝油精和一種維他命的產物來分給每一個碗裏。</p>
<p>在米珠薪桂的今天，我眞羨慕他們的營養！</p>
<p>經過門診室時，我看見護士和護士生們在醫生的領導下忙碌地工作着。</p>
<p>別了聖心－這病者的樂貧　，呻吟着的天堂！我仿佛看見一條黑暗崎嶇的山路，成千成萬的苦兒們在那里掙扎着，摔脫了惡魔的爪牙，投到光明之神的懷抱里，他們所藉以援　的，是這神聖的聖心醫院。（蓓蕾）</p>

<h3>農家副業——畜牧　靑年會農學講座　沈嘉徵講</h3>
<p>一般農家、大都不能利用餘　、農忙一過、便消磨時光於茶樓酒肆中、倘能因地制宜、從事畜收的生產、獲利之厚、不下農產、今天所講的、不過舉其一二、畜牧首重經騐、否則寗從小規模試養人手、免遭重大的損失、</p>
<p>牛</p>
<p>都市附近的農家、可鉰養乳牛、譬如籌款　千元、選購泌乳量旺盛的「霍爾斯丹」種小乳牛一頭、十餘歲兒童即能任畜養之責、二年後每月至少有五六百元之進益、照目前情形、牛奶棚及奶粉製造廠、需要甚殷、時値每磅生奶一元二角、每牛每日以產乳三十磅計、每日可得三十六元、每月即有千餘元收入、養牛首重選種、最優等牛日產八十磅以上、次宜預防疾病、因乳牛抵抗力薄弱、最易傳染胸膜肺炎、故每年夏秋兩季、必須注射預防針、管理亦不可疏忽、</p>
<p>豬</p>
<p>豬爲最普通的家畜、銷路甚爲廣大、惟利益不及乳牛優厚、農家養豬、目的不僅用其肉、且用其廐肥、况農產品中一部分殘淡廢物、又可利用以充豬食、成本便可减輕、徐家滙一帶、有專業養豬者、收購上各飯菜館的殘羹、雖在夏秋兩季、衛生方面不甚相宜、但價廉而營養豐富、頗合經濟原則、倘能以殘羹加沸至百度、則更較衛生、近來肉價奇貴、肥豬每頭可值千元左右、倘養母豬、每頭年可產小豬二次、每次八隻、二胎可得十六　、斷乳後每　以百元計、每年穩得一千六百元、至於豬種、以選購中國之金華豬及泰　豬或外國種「巴克夏」爲最佳、因這三種豬成長速而肉質佳、目耐合粗糙食料、管理又簡便的緣故、</p>
<p>羊</p>
<p>羊分山羊綿六羊兩種、綿羊以毛用著稱、但適宜飼養於北方較寒之區姑不具論、茲專就山羊之乳用種而言、其品種共有七八種之多、惟以「柴奈」種爲最著、每日可產奶五磅左右、多則可達十磅、每年產奶期平均有九個月、故每年約可產奶一千五百磅、每磅以一元三角計、即爲二千元左右之收入、至其飼料因產乳關係、應較鄕村一般的山羊爲優、爲乳羊體重五十斤、每日應給予的飼養量爲　乾草四市斤、　靑草二斤半、　豆腐渣三斤、　麸皮一斤半、　大麥半斤、　豆餅四分之一斤、</p>
<p>兎</p>
<p>兎有肉用、毛用、毛皮用三種、而以飼養毛用及毛皮用二種為有利、毛用兎以「盎哥拉」種為最著名、而尤以英系者毛細且長、過五六吋、細若絹絲、可製羢綫等毛織品之用、兎毛每年可剪四次、得毛在半磅以上、每磅時値以八十元計、全年可得四十元、倘能自行染紡自色、羢綫、則照目前市價每磅可得三百元、一兎產半磅可得一百五六十元、至於毛皮用兎的飼料費、與毛用兎不相上下、亦須將毛皮自行硝製後出買、年來市上流行的女皮大衣、大都均用兎皮製成、每襲難貴至二三千元、仍能暢銷一時、</p>
<p>雞</p>
<p>雞爲農村副業中最普遍的家禽、東西各國、無不飼養甚盛、我國養雞歷史最早、祗以農民向無科學智識、對於育種、飼養、管理諸端、任其自法、故雞種混雜、產卵甚少、大槪一雞每年產卵七八十個、照時值不過四十元、雞肉可售得三十元、共値七十元、而一年飼料、亦需此數、至於外國著名的「來克杭」雞、每年可產卵一百五十至三百個以上、飼料與中國雞相仿、產卵較大、售價亦較貴、如養雞三百隻、全年可盈餘萬餘元、一家數口、維持生活而有餘、惟欲從事養雞事業者、第一須選擇優良品種、第二須設備完善、第三須注意雞病的預防、如三者俱備、則成功可期、</p>
<p>蜂</p>
<p>蜂雖屬小見蟲而所產的蜜與蠟用途甚廣、蜂蜜也藥用外、可充調味料及營養品、蜂蠟則爲重要的工業原料、且爲軍用、醫藥所不可或缺的物品、故世界各國無不飼養甚盛、我國養蜂事業、尙未發達、且蜂種不良、產量不豐、普通良種爲意大利蜂、體長大、呈金黃色、每年每箱可產蜜二三十磅至五十磅不等、每磅以時値四元計可得一百元至二百元左右、此外尙有蜂蠟三四磅、亦可售得四五十元、至於蜂種大約每箱五框、有一萬隻、定價自一百五十元至二三百元不等、故蜜源旺盛之區養蜂事業最爲有利、因爲除購置蜂種、及調製蜜蠟器具等外無需飼料的消耗、且養蜂對農作物傳粉作用大有幫助其探蜜的植物種類爲紫雲英·蕎麥·瓜類·油菜·柑橘、蘋果·柿·茶等類、</p>

<h3>棉布獲利轉賣　售盤下挫</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市趨疲、乃因散戶獲利轉賣、而新囤戶因登記關係、不敢貪進、故售盤多數下挫、白貨跌二元至五元、漂染布跌二三元、府綢綫呢跌每碼五分至一角、大鵬細布一七五元、富貴細布一七二元、十六磅飛鴻粗布一七三元、十四磅　鹿一五七元、八磅振中粗布九十四元、雛雞士林布二六七元半、白貓花布一三五元、本街成交各布五百餘件、</p>

<h3>蘋菓（四）</h3>
<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>持歸蒔之，三年，乃結子五顆·「味如柰又似林　」，多汁，異常酸美！送縣，上州，以其奇味乃進之。後樹長成，漸至三百顆，每年進之，號日「朱柰，至今猶存。德貝博等州，取其枝接，所在豐足。人以爲從西域浮來，礙渚而住矣。」這條中所說「味如柰，又似林擒」，明明表示它和柰與擒稍有分別；「號曰朱柰」，却是因爲不知道它究竟叫什麽名字，所以只好和舊有之果名相比附也：你說這不是蘋果樹也又能够是什麼？假設有人不承認柰就是蘋果，至少現在他總該承認我國道時已有了眞正的蘋果樹吧！且它這條中又說：『德貝博等州，取其枝接，所在　足。』是運現在河北省所以多蘋果樹的原因，也淸楚的記錄出來了！這眞是絕無僅有的一種好史料！</p>
<p>唐朝是翻譯佛經最盛的時期，佛書的名辭，也當然在這時最爲人所熟知：果然「頻婆果」的名辭，恰又正是這時開始的，據太平廣記引證一種名叫洽開記的書說：「唐永徽中，魏郡臨黃王國村人王方言，嘗於河中灘上拾得一小樹裁，埋之，及長，乃林擒也：實大於小黃瓠，色白如玉，間以硃點，……光明瑩目，又非常美。……貢於高宗，以爲朱柰，又名五色林擒，或謂之聯珠果，種於苑中。……上大重之，賜王方言文林郞，亦各文林郞果俗云「頻婆果」河東多林擒，秦中亦不少，河西諸郡亦有林擒，皆小於文林果。」按貞觀永徽，－唐太宗高宗年號－朝代相次，頓丘臨黃，又地方相隣，這一條是否和朝野僉載中所載的是同一事件呢？我說無論怎樣吧：要是兩件事呢，旣足表示蘋果樹的傳入不止一次；就是一件事呢，也更能證明這件史跡的確實性；而我們也借着這後一種記載把頻婆果名稱的起源問題解決了。－郭棄駝種樹書已有「貧婆」之名，我以爲這書分明是假託的，故不取。（未完）</p>

<h3>「驢蒙虎皮」的故事</h3>
<p>— 金毅</p>
<p>假借名義，招搖撞騙的戲法，似乎古已有之，而今烈；從挾天子以令諸侯到兜賣燈泡等等，無一不是這種戲法的演變。但旣是戲法，總有些偷偷摸摸，鬼鬼祟祟，幸而成功，自然最好；萬一失敗，也可留掩飾餘地，要是「臂繞紅十字布章，胸佩銅質徽章」，這樣像模像樣地從事一行騙事業」，確是假借工部局食糧管理局名義這一案爲創始。</p>
<p>在洋米將罄，國米如珠，甚而購買赤荳也要排隊的今日，「辦瓖戶口食糧登記，按戶授糧」之舉，自然皆大歡喜，額手稱慶的功德；然而這輩不肖之徒的利潤何在呢？是否僅僅騙取幾個登記費，這里面似乎尙有報上語焉不詳的奧妙在</p>
<p>做一天吃一天的劣等小百姓果然常常爲了排隊而做吃不能兼顧，家中米袋堆得高山而還在軋米人手中出價收買的高等居民也是比比皆是，如果將現在全滬住戶調查一過，除家中粒米無存者外，我想第二個數字一定是超過「家藏食糧一月」的那種「高等收藏家」，他們正如從前的米蛀蟲一樣，以爲祇要自己「有恃無恐」，就是天下太平了。現在翻版的「驢蒙虎皮」的故事出現，其重要原因大概就在此。</p>
<p>翻版的「驢蒙虎皮」的故事當然不僅是「臂繞紅十字布章，胸佩銅質微章」這一件，機會所在，是無孔不入的；然而也正因爲有了「孔」，才能授黔驢以技。現在不是把個人關在米倉庫里就算最安全之道，兩租界當局最近對於食糧的各項實施辦法自有其步驟的，這步驟是普遍的「有飯大家吃」。明乎此，不宵之徒也無從蒙了虎皮作倀了。</p>
<h3>病與米</h3>
<p>— 枉也</p>
<p>本報分類廣吿上有一則「廣告」焉：「三國張飛曾對孔明道：我誰也不怕。孔明寫個病字在手心，問他怕也不怕？飛大叫曰噯喲，可見人生疾苦英雄力士也受不了……」云。</p>
<p>三國時米價如何，向未準確載諸史册；但幾百元一石的米也諒必不在孔明神算之內。即使退萬「米達」說，米也要軋吧，張飛有湖林橋　喝退曹兵的威望在前，一天一升總不會生問題的。又何况張飛也儘可能有「軋米黨」：劉備，關公，……阿斗等等。但如此「英雄力士」，見了區區「病」字竟然會「大叫噯喲」，可想而知那時候病的恐怖是遠過於米千百萬倍了。否則，孔明老先生的手心裏為啥勿寫「米」字呢？</p>
<p>我們二十世紀的「主人公」却推翻「好漢祗怕病來磨」的「俗見」，而定一新結論，曰：「好漢祇怕米無着」。且尙有佐證：就是生病間或尙能拖延時日，而沒有飯吃，女子七日則死，男子「大丈夫」三天就完了。</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（一）悲與喜</p>
<p>有人走到他家裏，見貼着兩句似通非通的標語，是：「賺錢之事無不爲；吃虧之事我不爲。」這話倒也不　是爲他自己寫照。他和葉家，後來又有了些關聯，爲的是葉愛棠去世，葉大太太辦理喪葬，料理偵務，會經把靠近衛家宅的田地，出賣二十幾畝與衛雲卿，衛　　臉上一些也不記掛葉大先生生前給予的難堪，只是付錢的時候，做了二十幾次付，並且說：「錢在手頭，食在口頭，葉家大嫂，你還是慢慢的拿慢慢的花的好。」</p>
<p>他今天突然走到葉家來，葉二太太和厲又榭，在百忙之中，出來招待。只見一個矮老頭兒站在地下，他頭上戴一頂大紅風帽，一件黑布馬褂，是五檔紐　，三檔還扣着銅質葡萄紐，兩檔却沒有了；一手提起了藍布大褂的大襟，很沉重的樣子。厲又榭愁容裏掙出些笑意來問道：「衛老先生，你是從那裏來？你兜着什麽東西？你請坐。」衛雲卿坐定了，笑道：「我從我們姑爺家裏回來，這是沿路拾的碎瓦片和斷磚，拾了三年，也可以砌一個公坑；　　糞，也可以賣個幾十僩錢，够我們少雲抽烟捲兒了。厲先生，剛才我在門外走過，遇到葉府上的長工，怎麼說大嫂子沒了，是眞的是假的？」葉二太太道：「是的，我們大嫂子去世了，兒子沒成家，後事都沒預備。」（三四）</p>
<h3>光陰的價格</h3>
<p>— 馬上</p>
<p>「一寸光陰一寸金，寸金難買寸光陰。」</p>
<p>光陰是可貴的。</p>
<p>像上一個鐘頭去問一問肥皂的價格，是二百二十元一箱，隔了一個鐘頭去買，却是二百二十三元了。</p>
<p>但是阿毛娘去軋米，排着班，等等四五個鐘頭，餓着肚皮，回來，兩手還是空空如也，原來米已售完，「明日請早」。</p>
<p>是這樣，光陰劃分了兩個價格。</p>
<h3>買麪包的痛苦</h3>
<p>— 維摩</p>
<p>光滑圓潤的麵包，望去熱烘烘的好不誘惑人，尤其在米貴如珠的今日，提到麵包兩字，少不得叫人嘴裏有些「難受」。本來麵包問題大家嚷了好一輩子，還弄不到一個妥善的解決辦法，而到了現在運買麵包都成爲一件痛苦的事了，還有什麼可說的呢？</p>
<p>對呀，什麽沙利文，義利，永安，先施……等等却有麵包出售。在平時，食料富豐的時候，除了偶爾採購一隻，還要夾了火腿，沙丁魚，或滿塗了白塔油，菓醬纔肯把它送進口之外，簡直連正眼都不要去看它。然而時至今日，買麵包已踏進了「軋」的陣錢，尋麵包也成爲一種專門「技術」了。</p>
<p>「麵包買完」這四個字——或爲售罄，或爲賣完，且不去管它，每次走過義利或沙利文，總在我的眼睛前面一亮，好像麵包除了「售完」之外，已經沒有別的再可表示之處了。有時候偶然看見一二隻，包得好好的存放在　子裏，這是顧主們的寄存品，照例無從割愛。</p>
<p>於是只有開始尋「雜牌」麵包了·一次在　　路一家糖菓舖子裏看見有幾枚法國式的長麵包堆在橱窗角落裹。跑進去買了一隻，拿在手裹似乎相當輕，而且瘦瘦的樣子，看上去一定「體重不足」。果然，我隨手把它放在磅秤上一秤，那隻針跳來跳去，老是在九兩左右，連十兩的關都跳不出。價錢倒是一元五角，未免有些懊喪·</p>
<p>所謂標準式的家庭用麵包，售價一元四角一只的，現在非付上一元八角不辦·質料比較輕鬆的一種，那末一元七角也可以買到。究竟標準何在，顧客們一時也弄不淸楚，而且大家拖着只要有得買，此外也就不去詳細研究了。</p>
<p>整批的麵包一到，大家叫囂搶買，幾十隻手高高舉起，好像市塲做賣買一般。差不多一班經常的顧客，一到這時候，老早就等在那裏，恭候「光駕」。所以一批麵包從麵包車子上拿下來之後，也等不得放在橱窗裏，在十幾分鐘之內，就被那些集體顧客們一哄買光。</p>
<p>店舖子裏對於這種賣法並不表示歡迎，他們覺得這來勢汹汹的客人是不好弄的，並且弄得不好，有的人買得到，有的人購不着，未免開罪顧主。至於幣制的折算，找補的麻煩等，更是手續繁多。</p>
<p>有些店家甚至創出「包送」「專運」等名目，當然他們都是「聖之時者也」之流，做生意人腦經靈敏，也就難怪要走上這條路。可是你一打聽在這種制度之下的價格，你就覺得麵包的滋味遠不如前，而且愈難下咽了。</p>
<h3>新的輪迴教育</h3>
<p>— 公鶏</p>
<p>天津南開大學在民國十一二年時候，鬧過一次「罷敎」風潮，原因是校刊上有一篇題目輪迴敎育的文章，大意說：被敎育者的出路祇是再去敎育別人。不知道是否曾當時南開大學的敎授們太多心，認爲意存諷刺，要求學校當局懲戒作者。偏偏一時査不出作者的眞名，敎授門就「罷敎」示威。事過境遷，「輪迴敎育」四個字，已經不脛而走，成爲口語。據說後來不獨「輪迴敎育」的作者跳出輪迴，事變前曾榮任華北統稅局長。而被指爲輪迥者的敎授們，也紛紛地「敎而優則仕」。或則由次長而公使，或則由大使而秘書長；至不濟的也當個把處長參事之流。我想他們現在想起當年「血脈僨張」的一慕，不免撇嘴一笑：「輪迴云乎！」「輪迴云乎哉」了！</p>
<p>時代不同，「輪迴的方式也變化了。我的朋友由法國留學歸來，也旣不學而優則敎」，也不「學而優則仕」，把睡覺吃飯拉屎以外的時間，全部消耗在舞塲裏。據說這是根據「學而優則舞」的最新原理，而且常常根據「舞理」，月旦「舞星」。朋友們有些心存問難，故意駁詰的，他口若懸河，雄辯滔滔，不但當者披靡，即如外行若我，也欽佩莫名。每有論列，必能够廣徵博引，並月能取出若干種法文的跳舞書，以資證實。很誠懇地說：「你們不要以爲我欺你們不懂法文，你看有圖爲證！有圖爲為證」果然，我的朋友們「看圖識字」的時候已經過了，現在進步到「看圖識舞」了！許多朋友，經他義務指正之後，一個個「舞藝高强」，而且都夜以繼日地「舞興遄飛」。我的朋友，並不此自滿，常說將來交通無阻，一定要出國去精究「舞技」。</p>
<p>若干日前，我做到一個夢，好像我的朋友已經由外國再度學成歸來。他對於舞塲的管理，舞星的駕馭，都著有專書·大家稱他爲舞國皇帝。經他倡導之後，不獨舞塲遍地，而且有女皆舞，無男不跳。「聞雞起舞」，於今爲烈。於是中華有舞國之稱，百姓有舞民之號。「學而優則舞」，「舞而優則學」，周而復始，「輪迥」不已，不知東方之已白。</p>
<h3>夏</h3>

<p>據昨日行情：</p>

<p>樟腦丸每磅十二元，</p>

<h3>The War Has Spread to the Indian Ocean: Japanese Troops Occupy the Andaman Islands; Indian Fleet Commander Recalls Indian Ships; Ceylon Parliament Rejects Conscription Bill</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Domei News Agency Telegram) – The Japanese Imperial General Headquarters announced at 11:00 AM today that Japanese army and navy units landed at Port Blair in the southern Andaman Islands, south of Bengal, on the 23rd of this month. The British garrison was unable to resist and surrendered unconditionally.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Domei News Agency Telegram) – Qualified observers commenting on the significance of the Japanese army's occupation of the Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal stated that this move has brought the Japanese army within dangerous striking distance of British military bases in Calcutta, Madras, and Ceylon. By using these islands as naval and air bases, the Japanese army can attack British communication lines to India and Australia. Geographically, the Andaman Islands are located in the Bay of Bengal, approximately equidistant from Saigon (i.e., Singapore), Rangoon, Madras, Calcutta, and Ceylon. The archipelago consists of five major islands and two hundred smaller islands, with a total area of approximately 2,500 square miles, featuring several ports and secure anchorages, the most important of which is Port Blair, with a population of approximately 17,000. Products include coconuts, rubber, ramie, yams, rice, beans, and tea.</p>
<p>Shanghai Huitong News Agency Special Dispatch – News was received yesterday from New Delhi that Vice Admiral Fitzherbert, Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Fleet, has ordered Indian warships stationed in New Guinea or patrolling the Mediterranean, Atlantic, and South Pacific oceans to return to Indian waters. The Indian fleet consists of only five gunboats and several smaller warships. India is currently engaged in constructing submarines, destroyers, and cruisers; however, what India urgently needs are torpedo boats and destroyers, which India cannot build itself.</p>
<p>Colombo, 26th (Reuters Telegram) – The Ceylon Parliament met today to discuss the implementation of a conscription bill, which was rejected by a vote of 22 to 17.</p>

The Japanese navy will continue to demonstrate its full power, not only deciding to fight in the Pacific and Indian Oceans but also deploying to oceans around the world as necessary. The victories achieved by the Japanese navy since the outbreak of the war are only the beginning. The time has now arrived to display the true power of the Japanese navy. The British and American fleets may adopt guerrilla tactics to try to recover their lost bases, but if the Japanese air and naval forces encounter the enemy, they will crush their attempts.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 26th (Huitong News Agency Telegram) – According to news from Australia, Australian gold mines will be closed by the government for the duration of the war.

<h3>Travel Notes on the Indian Peninsula (4)</h3>
<p>When the train stopped at a station in the early morning, men and women went to the water pipes near the platform to bathe. Once, we saw a man bathing completely through the train window. He first stretched out one arm and washed it completely, then washed his thigh. In this way, he scrubbed completely and washed his whole body with only a small basin of water!</p>
<p>Ever-changing pictures flashed before our eyes: ragged people huddled up asleep, waiting for tomorrow morning's train; coolies with red cloths wrapped around their heads squatted on a line, ready to carry eighty pounds of assorted luggage for a mere anna (two cents); you had to wait until the train stopped to scramble onto another dining car, gulp down your coffee, and rush back to your own compartment; the first-class carriages were particularly comfortable, with private showers and lots of fans; bedding was not provided on the train, so you had to bring your own; dust got everywhere...</p>
<p>We arrived in Baroda feeling very cramped. After setting up the mirrors, boxes, and lights in the grand hall, the ceremony was about to begin.</p>
<p>The monarch sat on a golden throne, wearing a crown with jeweled ornaments, receiving the people's congratulations. Behind him stood two very imposing guards, holding golden maces. The Crown Prince stood on his right, wearing a headband adorned with jade. The Baroda Prince's decorations included dazzling jewels, a jade brooch, and a feather plume on his headdress.</p>
<p>The ceremony lasted an hour, and one part involved the people offering grain to the monarch, who returned a small portion to the giver. Singers and dancers entertained the guests in a corner of the hall.</p>
<p>Kites and Baseballs</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the monarch and his eldest son accompanied us for a walk in the large garden behind the hall. It was half a mile to move the photography equipment from the audience hall to the garden. The young Crown Prince discussed the games of polo and kites with us, and from the conversation, we knew that he also enjoyed baseball.</p>
<p>We saw several national treasures, including a solid gold cannon weighing 280 pounds (worth $117,600) and a beautiful silver and gold carriage. They were displayed during important ceremonies, and the former was pulled by two milk-white oxen.</p>
<p>We wanted to go to the neighboring desert city of Bikaner for two reasons. First, the Prince of Bikaner's grandson, Ghani, was marrying a princess from Dunkirk, and we wanted to photograph the engagement ceremony. In our Western eyes, this kind of ceremony is rare. But more importantly, we could attend another wedding ceremony: the Prince of Bikaner's granddaughter was marrying the Crown Prince of Jodhpur, a city with very ancient foundations, dating back to before the time of Christ. This wedding had been planned for a year, and the date was about six weeks after Ghani's engagement ceremony, making it one of the grandest ceremonies in India in recent years.</p>
<p>The next morning, we left Baroda and crossed the desert to Bikaner. After the train had passed two stations, there was a knock on the carriage door, followed by a neatly dressed waiter.</p>
<p>"His Highness has sent breakfast," he said. "What would you like?"</p>
<p>Everything was at our disposal! Paget (i.e., the author Mrs. Dyott) was always like a hungry wolf, wanting oatmeal porridge, toast, and coffee. Lorne was still sleepy and lazily agreed. Thus, a delicious breakfast was cooked and sent to us.</p>
<p>When the train arrived at the next station, the waiter came again. What else did we want to eat? We decided on ham and eggs. This time, because the food had to be cooked at the station, the train stopped for a while.</p>
<p>When we arrived at Bikaner station, the Prince's British-Indian representatives welcomed us at the station, and we were escorted by a guard to the reception hall.</p>
<p>Passing through the city streets lined with troops, we encountered many interesting processions. First, there was a camel-riding drummer, followed by two horse-riding drummers, a military band, and a company of infantry. A magnificent, fully equipped elephant led the way, with many people carrying the betrothal gifts on covered silver platters, followed by many carriages carrying distinguished guests. They were on their way to the palace to attend the engagement ceremony.</p>

<h3>Gandhi Invited to New Delhi; Meets Cripps Today; Consultations on Indian Affairs Enter New Stage; Kuomintang Standing Committee Meeting Scheduled for the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>New Delhi, 26th (Reuters Telegram) – Cripps recently disclosed that he had telegraphed Gandhi two or three days ago, stating that he would be happy to have the opportunity to talk with him. He subsequently received a reply from Gandhi, stating, "Thank you for your telegram. The Standing Committee of the Indian National Congress has decided that only the President and Nehru should meet with you. You also know that I oppose all wars, but if you wish to meet with me, I would be happy to see you. I can depart on Thursday morning." Cripps replied, "I am very eager to meet you." He expects to meet with Gandhi tomorrow.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 26th (Reuters Telegram) – After meeting with Sir Stafford Cripps, the British envoy to India, yesterday, the President of the Indian National Congress, Azad, looked somber and dazed. He immediately convened a meeting of the party's Standing Committee on the 29th to discuss Cripps' plan. Azad also consulted with various important figures in the party and Gandhi's son, Devdas. When asked if Azad intended to continue talks with Cripps, Azad remained silent. Three minutes after Azad's departure, Cripps welcomed the leader of the Muslim League, Jinnah, into his residence for a 75-minute meeting. Jinnah left with documents in hand, looking very happy, in stark contrast to Azad. According to Jinnah, the suggestions received will be submitted to the Muslim League Action Committee for discussion tomorrow. The leader of the Hindu Mahasabha, Savarkar, is scheduled to meet with Cripps on the 28th. Cripps originally met with military and political authorities at the Governor-General's residence, but only moved to his residence yesterday to meet with representatives of various parties. The consultations on the Indian issue have thus entered a new stage.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 26th (Reuters Telegram) – Cripps today met with the Maharajah of Nawanagar (President of the Chamber of Princes) and the Maharajah of Bikaner (Acting President of the Chamber of Princes). He will also meet with Labour Party members of the Indian Central Legislative Assembly. Cripps has also met with Sir Conrad Corfield, Political Advisor to the Viceroy of India.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 26th (Reuters Telegram) – Cripps told reporters this morning that he was asked when he could make a statement on the proposals he brought.

<h3>Soviet Ambassador Delivers Speech in Britain; Advocates Immediate Offensive</h3>
<p>London, 25th (Havas News Agency Telegram) – Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky recently delivered a speech here, stating that the Allied powers should make their greatest effort at this time and not wait until 1943. If the Allied forces want to win, they must take the offensive immediately. The way to attack is to attack the German army from the Soviet front. All efforts must be concentrated to achieve a decisive victory. As for how to attack, this question should be answered by the General Staff. However, one point should be clear: the attack must be launched in 1942, not 1943. This is the only way to win. The enemy army is making its greatest effort this spring, and we should also make the same effort to cope with it.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 26th (Huitong News Agency Telegram) – The London Times published an article today supporting Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky's demand, advocating that for the sake of British honor, British industry and diplomacy must fulfill their moral and material obligations.</p>
<h3>Hungary and Romania: Border Tranquility; Hungary Remains Silent on Disputes</h3>
<p>Bucharest, Romania, 25th (Havas News Agency Dispatch): Rumors circulating about serious incidents occurring on the border between Hungarian and Romanian troops have been denied by military circles here. It is reported that the border between Hungary and Romania, as well as all regions of Romania, are as tranquil as usual.</p>
<p>Bucharest, Romania, 25th (Havas News Agency Dispatch): Prime Minister General Ion Antonescu signed an order today implementing mandatory military service. The order stipulates that all young men in the country must enlist and serve for two years. Upon completion of their service, they will be transferred to the reserves, but may be mobilized at any time before the age of fifty.</p>
<p>Budapest, Hungary, 25th (Havas News Agency Dispatch): The Hungarian News Agency recently announced that, following the speech by Romanian Deputy Prime Minister Mihai Antonescu regarding the issue of Outer Transylvania, the country's newspapers have also launched an anti-Hungarian propaganda campaign. The dispute between Romania and Hungary has thus attracted worldwide attention. However, Hungary remains silent, as its foreign policy is not focused on dramatic performances but on practical results. According to a spokesman for the Hungarian Foreign Ministry, Hungary opposes mutual attacks among European countries, considering it a violation of European conduct. Therefore, the Romanian-Hungarian issue is only seeing unilateral action from the Romanian government and its newspapers, while the Hungarian government and newspapers have consistently remained silent.</p>
<h3>US President and Iranian Shah Exchange Telegrams</h3>
<p>Washington, 25th: It is understood from the content of the telegrams exchanged between the U.S. President and the Shah of Iran that the provisions of the Atlantic Charter are also extended to Iran. The Shah of Iran telegraphed that Iran has allied with Britain and the Soviet Union, and stated, "Iran has always expressed confidence in the friendship between the U.S. and Iran, and deeply believes that Your Excellency's consistent adherence to fundamental principles will ensure that the promised commitments are implemented, enabling the nation and its people to develop peacefully and build a bright future." The U.S. President replied by telegram, saying that he was "particularly pleased" that the Iranian-British-Soviet alliance stipulates that Britain and the Soviet Union are resolved to respect Iran's territorial integrity, sovereignty, and political independence. He further expressed his satisfaction that Iran is willing to cooperate with the Allied nations.</p>
<p>London, 25th (Havas News Agency Dispatch): Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Law, stated in a speech in the House of Commons today, "I have every reason to believe that the new Iranian government will continue to cooperate with its predecessor and will fulfill the alliance previously signed between Britain, the Soviet Union, and Iran."</p>
<h3>Hitler Meets with Boris in His Headquarters; Rumors Suggest Bulgaria Will Participate in the Eastern Front War; Turkish Political Circles Monitor European Developments</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch): The German Führer's headquarters announced last night that Führer Hitler met with King Boris of Bulgaria at his headquarters on March 24th. The talks were lengthy and conducted in a very cordial atmosphere. That evening, the King attended a banquet hosted by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. The following day, the King visited General Göring at Carinhall.</p>
<p>Istanbul, Turkey, 25th (Havas News Agency Dispatch): Political circles here are closely monitoring the development of the European situation, especially the visit of King Boris of Bulgaria to Berlin, while maintaining a calm attitude. It is believed that the Bulgarian government will soon sever ties with the Soviet Union, and its troops will participate in the Eastern Front war. However, such a development is not necessarily beneficial to Turkey, as the threat to Turkey's western border may thereby be alleviated. Furthermore, the war psychology induced by the propaganda personnel of various countries here can also be reduced. Recently, Britain, the Soviet Union, and Bulgaria have all been creating suspicion in Turkey, seeking to give Turkey the impression that war is imminent. For example, Bulgarian propaganda claims that the country must guard its Thracian border and cannot send troops to the Soviet front lines. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, asserts that Bulgaria may attack Turkey, forcing Turkey and Bulgaria to station large numbers of troops on their borders, so that Bulgaria will have no surplus strength to send troops to fight against the Soviet Union. In Bulgaria's view, it will be very difficult to avoid participating in the Eastern Front war from now on. If it does not participate, the country will lose the territories it gained in 1939. In this regard, the country is in a similar position to Hungary. As for the return of German Ambassador to Turkey, Franz von Papen, to Germany and the return of Turkish Ambassador to Germany, Celal Muhtar, to Turkey, it is at least related to the situation in Bulgaria. After the German and Turkish envoys returned to their respective countries to report, Germany may have assured Bulgaria that Turkey has no intention of invading Bulgaria. In short, Turkey's attitude can be summarized in one sentence: avoid getting caught up in the vortex of war at any cost, because Turkey's participation in the war would be more harmful than beneficial.</p>
<p>Turkey and Bulgaria to Hold Important Talks</p>
<p>Istanbul, 25th (Havas News Agency Dispatch): Well-informed sources have announced that Turkish Minister to Italy, Teko, will soon return home to report on his duties. This coincides with the return of the Turkish Ambassador to Germany. Political circles therefore believe that the Turkish government intends to hold important talks on its relations with Europe this spring on the eve of a major event. At the same time, the former Turkish Ambassador to Britain, Rüştü Aras, has also returned here to report to the government on the current situation in Britain. It is rumored that President İsmet İnönü may meet with an important Bulgarian figure within days, as evidenced by President İnönü's continued stay here and the suggestion that he may visit Edirne in the north next month. The geographical location of this city leads observers to believe that Turkey and Bulgaria will hold talks there. However, well-informed political sources have said that the President's trip is only to inspect troops.</p>
<p>Ankara, 26th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch): The Turkish-Bulgarian trade negotiations currently underway in Ankara are progressing smoothly, and a trade agreement is expected to be concluded soon. The Bulgarian representative has prepared to sign the draft agreement and is awaiting instructions from his superiors to decide whether or not to sign the agreement.</p>

During the Soviet offensive in the Crimea, they used artillery fire and tanks for cover, and the fighting extended to the entire front, but they were eventually repulsed with heavy losses by the German army with the help of dive bombers. The Soviet army reorganized its remnants in an attempt to attack again, but was also defeated by German artillery fire. In the afternoon of the same day, the Soviet offensive was repulsed again, and ten tanks were destroyed. In the Donets region, the snow and ice are gradually melting, and the fighting is also very fierce. The Soviet army, with the help of artillery and tanks, launched fierce attacks on various key points, but to no avail. The Soviet army also attacked the positions of the Romanian troops. The Romanian army, in cooperation with German armored units and mountain troops, launched a counterattack and captured a village. Hungarian troops also launched a local offensive and occupied a village. During an aerial battle there, Croatian and Italian planes shot down three enemy planes. The German Air Force was very active in the fighting on Tuesday. When German planes bombed Soviet positions on the Kerch Peninsula, they engaged in aerial combat with enemy planes. German planes bombed Soviet concentration points and tank columns, destroying twelve tanks. German planes were not only very active on the Kerch Peninsula, but also engaged in aerial combat with Soviet planes in the Crimea, shooting down nineteen Soviet planes.

<h3>Prominent Figures and Elders of This City Held a Public Memorial Service for Han Guojun Yesterday; Over a Hundred Elders Attended in Full Formal Attire; A Village Posthumous Title Ceremony Was Held, Bestowing Han Qin Ke Gong</h3>
<p>After the death of Han Zishi (Guojun) of Hai'an, the prominent figures and elders who knew him during his lifetime in Shanghai held a public memorial service at Jing'an Temple yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM and publicly bestowed a village posthumous title. The details of the event are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Participating Elders</p>
<p>The public memorial service yesterday was held in the back hall of Jing'an Temple. Over a hundred elders attended, including Chen Taoyi, Jiang Weiqiao, Jia Shiyi, Shen Enfu, Wu Zhaoyuan, Ji Longtu, Zhang Yipeng, Jin Dingdong, Song Dexuan, Li Yizun, Chen Yunzhong, Shi Shengyuan, Yu Haicen, Tao Fuqing, Ding Fubao, Yu Chengxiu, Feng Qie, Liu Zhenqiu, Hu Jun, etc.</p>
<p>Details of the Public Memorial Service</p>
<p>The public memorial service began at 2:00 PM. Wu Zhaoyuan was appointed as the chief officiant, with Ji Longtu, Shen Enfu, Chen Taoyi, Zhang Yipeng, and Jin Dingxun as accompanying officiants, and Liu Zhenqiu as the master of ceremonies. After the chief officiant, accompanying officiants, and participants took their places, incense and wreaths were offered, followed by libations and silk offerings, and the presentation of dishes. Jin Dingdong then read the eulogy. After reading, everyone bowed once. Next, the chief officiant and accompanying officiants presented congratulatory silk, which was burned at the incineration site. After returning to their places, Miss Liu, the second daughter of the Han family, delivered a speech on behalf of the family, and the memorial ceremony was completed.</p>
<p>Holding the Village Posthumous Title Ceremony</p>
<p>After the public memorial service, the ceremony of respectfully bestowing the village posthumous title was held. Jiang Zhuzhuang was appointed as the chairman. Pang Diancai reported on Han's life, such as his efforts in water conservancy, maintaining sovereignty, and his dedication to social causes in his later years, as well as his steadfast integrity. His words were very concise and essential. Next, the chairman respectfully read the village posthumous title document (recorded separately), requesting the posthumous title of "Qin Ke" (Diligent and Respectful), which was unanimously approved. At this point, everyone performed the ceremony again. Finally, Ms. Liu Xian delivered a thank-you speech on behalf of the family, and the event concluded.</p>
<p>The Posthumous Title is Qin Ke (Diligent and Respectful)</p>
<p>The village posthumous title document is recorded below: "Zhou's [posthumous title] method is to dissolve the law, just like Duke Zhou and Grand Duke Wang, who opened the way for the king's cause and built meritorious deeds in the Muye fields, finally buried [after death]. Hence, the posthumous title method was created. A posthumous title is a trace of one's actions, accumulated over a lifetime and then bestowed as a posthumous title. It is for encouraging good deeds and showcasing virtuous deeds. This began in Zhou, and subsequent dynasties after Han continued to follow it until the Qing dynasty without interruption. After Mr. Han Zishi returned to the Dao Mountain, his colleagues privately bestowed a posthumous title. We respectfully follow the saying in the Book of Rites that 'the livelihood of the people lies in action,' and the Book of Songs says, 'performing duties with respect.' Mr. Han is undoubtedly worthy of this. Therefore, the posthumous title is 'Qin Ke' (Diligent and Respectful) to show it to future generations. Do not forget his great virtue. Jiang Weiqiao respectfully recognizes, Chen Taoyi respectfully writes."</p>
<p>Collecting Posthumous Manuscripts</p>
<p>Han's disciple, Pang Diancai, issued a call for the collection of Han's posthumous poems and essays. The announcement reads: "Our late teacher, Han Guojun, passed away last winter. His morality and writings were praised by his contemporaries. However, most of his lifelong works were destroyed in the recent war. Only two books, his self-edited chronicle and Yong Yi Lu, remain. These have already been sent for printing. If friends have any of Teacher Zi Shi's poems and essays, please copy and send them to my residence at 302 Huanlong Road so that they can be compiled and published. As for the chronicle and Yong Yi Lu, due to limited funds, only a small number will be printed. If you wish to order additional copies, the cost of materials for each copy is five yuan. Please submit your order to the Jin Cheng Bank at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Carter Road before April 10th to receive a receipt. You can pick up the book at the Bai Song Printing House at 689 Zhejiang Road two months later."</p>

<p>Contents of the Statement</p>
<p>The Chief of the Press Section of the Army and Navy stated: "After the Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai entered the Concession on December 8th of last year, the acquisition, loss, change, or transfer of rights to movable and immovable property within the Concession was prohibited. Hostile factories and educational institutions were sealed off. This was solely to eliminate and remove the influence of England and the United States, who had been exploiting the Orient for over a century, and other hostile countries, and who had used the Shanghai area as a base for anti-Japanese activities for many years. Now, after about three months, the Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai have fully understood the complex and diverse past plans of England, the United States, and other hostile countries in the Shanghai area and are focusing on the peaceful and happy life of the good citizens. They issued a joint statement by the Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai on February 12th to clarify their direction. That is, the Army and Navy in Shanghai, out of deep concern for the welfare and well-being of the citizens, are making every effort to quickly import materials from Thailand, French Indochina, and other southern regions. However, the citizens should also be aware that hoarding must be eliminated, consumption must be reduced, and the entire strength of the Chinese people and land must be used to bring a large amount of materials into the Shanghai area. These materials should be combined with the existing materials in Shanghai to provide for the needs of the people. It is hoped that everyone will work hard to accomplish this. Therefore, the Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai will set limits on the materials in Shanghai and use them effectively. To control the use, manufacture, and sale of all materials in the Shanghai area in the future, the Director-General of the Hua Central Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board will be responsible for controlling and using them. Therefore, the movement of important materials within the region will be controlled. However, this control of movement will be gradually lifted as the various control mechanisms for the use, manufacture, and sale of the listed items are completed. However, the provisional regulations for the control of the movement of materials in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which were previously formulated and promulgated by the General Headquarters of the China Expeditionary Army and the Headquarters of the China Area Fleet, will still apply to the movement of materials from the Shanghai area to other areas or from outside the area to the Shanghai area. In addition, those who have already obtained a permit in accordance with the regulations do not need to be subject to the permission for the movement of materials within the area stipulated in this announcement. It is hoped that the citizens will understand and fully cooperate."</p>

<h3>A Visit to the Sacred Heart Hospital</h3>
<p>A Paradise for the Welfare of Impoverished Children</p>
<p>No one should forget! Before the war, the Sacred Heart Hospital was one of the best-equipped and most life-saving hospitals in China. Its paving stone therapy made astonishing contributions to our country's medical field. Later, due to environmental reasons, after many setbacks, it moved from its original location on Ningguo Road in Yangshupu to its current location on Qiqi Road. However, some Shanghai people who love excitement and indulge in extravagance have probably forgotten it!</p>
<p>A three-story Western-style house, a red surrounding wall, encircling trees, and two porcelain plaques with four golden characters on the iron gate, this is the "Sacred Heart Hospital." There, it is shrouded in a tranquil atmosphere. Although it is only separated from the outside world by a wall, I feel as if they are two different worlds. On the green grass, I saw several patients strolling, and some were squatting down to study something. After explaining my intentions to a doorman, I was greeted by a Catholic nun. Her white clothing symbolizes the purity of her heart, and her kindness gave me a feeling of instant familiarity. It turned out her name was Sister Shen.</p>
<p>"How is your hospital doing recently?" I leaned in and asked her anxiously.</p>
<p>"Our hospital has fifty beds, but considering the countless impoverished patients outside who cannot be admitted, we also set up outpatient registration every morning, charging only a handling fee of six jiao, and also have free clinics. We hope that poor people can also enjoy some health and happiness," Sister Shen said slowly. Her face was filled with compassion, kindness, love, and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>"Your hospital's spirit of relief is truly great!" These were my thoughts, so I couldn't help but blurt them out. "How many doctors and nurses do you have?"</p>
<p>"The chief physician is Dr. Zhang Lianghui. In addition, there are over fifty nurses, including British and French head nurses, nurses, and student nurses."</p>
<p>Then, she accompanied me to visit the wards. There were ordinary rooms for three yuan a day and second-class rooms for five yuan a day. What interested me most was the "Children's Room." Those innocent and lively little angels were sitting around small tables playing with wooden ducks! Wooden elephants! Wooden trucks! Six-sided paintings! Nineteen small cradles were arranged parallel on both sides, with chamber pots and small chairs placed underneath. A small coffee table separated each bed. When they saw us, they all affectionately called "Mommy!" One little girl even rushed to hug Sister Shen's knee. Sister Shen told me that these were all orphans abandoned by their parents. The girl hugging her was already six years old. When she was two years old and not even two feet tall, she suffered from rickets and could not stand or talk at all. Her parents decided she was a monster and sent her here, but after more than a year of treatment by Dr. Zhang, she was finally cured.</p>
<p>"Look how lively she is!" Sister Shen had a proud expression.</p>
<p>"Has Sister Shen adopted any orphans recently?"</p>
<p>"We were preparing to, but due to funding difficulties and the recent lack of milk substitutes, we had to postpone it temporarily. It's already very difficult to support the orphans who are already here!" A cloud of sorrow flew onto her loving face. Yes, she felt sorrow for these poor orphans, worried about the many orphans who could not receive her kindness, and grieved for the suffering Chinese brethren!</p>
<p>"What about the older ones?"</p>
<p>"After the children turn ten, we send them to Jinan for foster care. There is a very large orphanage there that specializes in accepting orphans from all over. In addition to teaching, nurturing, and literacy, the boys learn a trade, and the girls learn needlework. They all have a skill. Every year, hundreds of pairs of orphans are matched up to become husband and wife and start their own businesses."</p>
<p>It was already eleven thirty! The maidservant brought the children their meals. Each had two dishes? Fresh fish and radishes. A white-clad angel even brought a bottle of cod liver oil and a kind of vitamin product to distribute to each bowl.</p>
<p>In today's world of expensive rice and firewood, I truly envied their nutrition!</p>
<p>When passing through the outpatient clinic, I saw nurses and student nurses working busily under the guidance of doctors.</p>
<p>Farewell, Sacred Heart - this haven for the sick and poor, a heaven of groans! I seemed to see a dark and rugged mountain road, where thousands upon thousands of suffering children were struggling, escaping the clutches of demons, and throwing themselves into the embrace of the god of light. What they relied on for rescue was this sacred Sacred Heart Hospital. (蓓蕾)</p>

<h3>Japanese Authorities Consider Repatriating Nationals of Various Countries, Including Those from Belligerent Nations and Countries with Severed Diplomatic Relations. Those Wishing to Leave Shanghai Should Register with the Japanese Consulate. Nationals of Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and Belgium Are Not Included.</h3>
<p>A Tongmeng News Agency dispatch from this city: Mr. Kawasaki, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy, specially summoned news reporters for a meeting yesterday afternoon to disclose that the Japanese authorities are considering repatriating civilian enemy nationals, but have not yet agreed on a specific plan. The Japanese authorities are currently preparing to formulate an easily implementable plan. The Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai issued a notice on March 27.</p>
<p>Those Wishing to Leave Shanghai Should Register Immediately</p>
<p>It stated briefly that the Japanese authorities intend to repatriate nationals of enemy countries (excluding British, American, Dutch, and Belgian nationals) and nationals of countries that have severed diplomatic relations with Japan residing in Shanghai. Those wishing to leave Shanghai should register with the passport section of the Japanese Consulate General at the Li Cha Hotel within this month. The spokesman reiterated that the above notice does not apply to British, American, Dutch, and Belgian nationals, as the British and American governments, entrusted to the Swiss government, and the Belgian government, entrusted to the Swedish government, are already engaged in negotiations with the Japanese government to repatriate their respective nationals.</p>
<p>Applications for Repatriation Are Divided into Two Categories</p>
<p>Those applying for repatriation will be divided into two categories: non-permanent residents and residents. The first category includes diplomatic and consular personnel, government-appointed officials, correspondents and newspaper reporters, Red Cross personnel and their dependents, and travelers who happened to be in Shanghai at the time of the outbreak of war. The second category includes women, children, and those with special and sufficient reasons. Although the above notice only applies to nationals in the Shanghai area, Japanese consulates in other areas are now taking similar steps.</p>

<h3>Greek Jeweler Embezzles Huge Sum of Money</h3>
<p>A Russian named Peerston, also known as Balabasch, opened a jewelry store at 304 Avenue Mesny in the French Concession. In May of last year, a Greek broker named Kaishana Chaizhalov (814-816 Avenue Joffre) sold jewelry and diamonds for Peerston, amounting to 116,738 yuan. All sale prices were paid by checks signed by Kaishana's lover, Su Laiweiqu (a Russian dancer residing at 353 Rue Corneille). Apart from the amount received by Peerston, 256,758 yuan was still owed. Although Peerston demanded payment from Kaishana, he kept delaying. In reality, Kaishana had used the money to buy a car worth over 20,000 yuan and was living with Su, spending his days in leisure. Peerston reported this information to the French police, accusing Kaishana Chaizhalov and the dancer Su Miweiqu of fraud. The police investigated and confirmed the facts, arresting Kaishana and Su and detaining them for investigation before handling the case according to law.</p>

<h3>Farmers' Sideline Business - Animal Husbandry: Youth Association Agricultural Lecture, Lecture by Shen Jiazheng</h3>
<p>Most farmers cannot utilize their spare time. Once the busy farming season is over, they waste their time in teahouses and taverns. If they can adapt to local conditions and engage in animal husbandry production, the profits can be no less than agricultural production. What I am talking about today is just a brief overview. Animal husbandry emphasizes experience. Otherwise, it is better to start small to avoid significant losses.</p>
<p>Cattle</p>
<p>Farmers near urban areas can raise dairy cows. For example, if you raise 1,000 yuan, you can choose a small Holstein dairy cow that produces a lot of milk. Children over ten years old can be responsible for raising them. After two years, there will be at least five or six hundred yuan of income per month. Under the current situation, milk sheds and milk powder factories are in great demand. Currently, the price of raw milk is 1 yuan and 2 jiao per pound. Each cow produces 30 pounds of milk per day, yielding 36 yuan per day, and over 1,000 yuan per month. The most important thing in raising cows is to choose the breed. The best cows produce over 80 pounds per day. Next, it is necessary to prevent diseases, because dairy cows have weak resistance and are most susceptible to pleuropneumonia. Therefore, preventive injections must be given every summer and autumn. Management should not be neglected either.</p>
<p>Pigs</p>
<p>Pigs are the most common livestock, and their sales are very wide. However, the profits are not as good as dairy cows. Farmers raise pigs not only for their meat but also for their manure. Moreover, some of the residue from agricultural products can be used as pig feed, which can reduce costs. In the Xujiahui area, there are professional pig farmers who purchase leftovers from various restaurants. Although this is not very hygienic in the summer and autumn seasons, it is cheap and nutritious, which is quite economical. If the leftovers can be boiled to 100 degrees, it will be more hygienic. Recently, meat prices have been surprisingly expensive, and each fat pig can be worth around 1,000 yuan. If you raise sows, each sow can produce two litters of piglets per year, with eight piglets each time, resulting in sixteen piglets in two litters. Each piglet can be sold for 100 yuan after weaning, resulting in a stable income of 1,600 yuan per year. As for the breed of pigs, it is best to choose Chinese Jinhua pigs and Thai pigs or the foreign breed "Berkshire," because these three types of pigs grow quickly, have good meat quality, are tolerant of rough feed, and are easy to manage.</p>
<p>Sheep</p>
<p>Sheep are divided into two types: goats and wool sheep. Wool sheep are known for their wool, but they are suitable for raising in the colder areas of the north, so I won't discuss them in detail. Here, I will focus on the milk-producing breeds of goats. There are seven or eight varieties, but the "Chai Nai" breed is the most famous. It can produce about five pounds of milk per day, and up to ten pounds in some cases. The average milk production period is nine months per year, so it can produce about 1,500 pounds of milk per year. At 1 yuan and 3 jiao per pound, this is an income of about 2,000 yuan. Due to milk production, their feed should be better than that of ordinary goats in the countryside. For a milk goat weighing 50 pounds, the daily feed amount should be: 4 jin of dried grass, 2.5 jin of green grass, 3 jin of tofu dregs, 1.5 jin of wheat bran, 0.5 jin of barley, and 0.25 jin of soybean cake.</p>
<p>Rabbits</p>
<p>There are three types of rabbits: meat rabbits, wool rabbits, and fur rabbits. Raising wool rabbits and fur rabbits is more profitable. The "Angora" breed is the most famous for wool rabbits, especially the English variety, which has fine and long hair, over five or six inches, as fine as silk, which can be used to make cashmere yarn and other woolen products. Rabbit hair can be sheared four times a year, yielding more than half a pound of hair. At the current price of 80 yuan per pound, the annual income is 40 yuan. If you can dye and spin the yarn yourself, the cashmere yarn can fetch 300 yuan per pound at the current market price. Half a pound from one rabbit can earn one hundred and fifty or sixty yuan. As for the feed cost of fur rabbits, it is about the same as wool rabbits. The fur must be tanned before selling. In recent years, fur coats that are popular on the market are mostly made of rabbit fur. Each coat costs as much as two or three thousand yuan and is still selling well.</p>
<p>Chickens</p>
<p>Chickens are the most common poultry in rural sidelines. They are raised in both Eastern and Western countries. China has the earliest history of raising chickens, but because farmers lack scientific knowledge, they let them grow naturally in terms of breeding, feeding, and management. Therefore, chicken breeds are mixed, and they lay very few eggs. Generally, a chicken lays seventy or eighty eggs per year, which is worth only about 40 yuan at the current price. The chicken meat can be sold for 30 yuan, totaling 70 yuan, while the annual feed also costs this amount. As for the famous foreign "Leghorn" chickens, they can lay more than 150 to 300 eggs per year. The feed is similar to Chinese chickens, the eggs are larger, and the selling price is also more expensive. If you raise 300 chickens, you can earn more than 10,000 yuan throughout the year, which is more than enough to support a family of several people. However, those who want to engage in chicken farming must first choose good breeds, second, have complete equipment, and third, pay attention to the prevention of chicken diseases. If all three are met, success can be expected.</p>
<p>Bees</p>
<p>Although bees are small insects, the honey and wax they produce have a wide range of uses. In addition to medicinal use, honey can be used as a seasoning and nutritional product. Beeswax is an important industrial raw material and is indispensable for military and medical use. Therefore, all countries in the world raise them extensively. China's beekeeping industry is still not developed, and the bee breeds are inferior, resulting in low yields. The common good breed is the Italian bee, which is large in size, golden in color, and can produce 20 to 30 pounds to 50 pounds of honey per hive per year. At the current price of 4 yuan per pound, this can earn 100 to 200 yuan. In addition, there are also three or four pounds of beeswax, which can also be sold for 40 to 50 yuan. As for the bee breeds, each hive is about five frames, with 10,000 bees, and the price ranges from 150 yuan to 300 yuan. Therefore, beekeeping is most profitable in areas with abundant honey sources. Because in addition to purchasing bee breeds and preparing honey and wax tools, no feed consumption is required. And beekeeping is of great help to the pollination of crops. The plant types that they collect honey from include milk vetch, buckwheat, melons, rapeseed, citrus, apples, persimmons, and tea.</p>

In the first half, neither side scored. At the resumption of play, the French army's central defender Mann was ambitious and attempted to invade the Central Plains.

<h3>Favorable News: The Bond Market is Gradually Prospering; Chinese and Western Stocks Also Rise</h3>
<p>The grey market for public bonds was quite smooth at the beginning of yesterday's session. Sellers seemed to be putting high pressure, but buyers were very enthusiastic, taking up every offer. Sellers had already sold a lot the day before, and their momentum was weakening, so prices rose gradually. Among them, Category D was the most crowded. It opened at 58 yuan and 1 jiao, and buyers flocked in, instantly rising to north of 1 yuan. Generally, the opening price was changed to 8 yuan and 3 jiao. At that time, Dakangcheng, the seller, had only 200,000 to 300,000 yuan left, and it felt like there was too little porridge for too many monks, and even higher at 9 yuan and 5 jiao. Category D was uniquely cheap, and everyone flocked to it. It was the only one that fell the day before, but yesterday it rose the most. Tongli, Hongda, Runli, Hongxing, Dafeng, and Yitai all bought in. Dakangcheng, Hu Heji, Zhongyi, and Lianhe supplied more. Others like Hengtai and Baolong also offered some.

<h3>Gold Reverses Course from Rise to Fall; Military Notes Also See Decline</h3>
<p>The cash market, previously overheated, has reversed its course from rising to falling. After briefly exceeding the 19,000 yuan mark, it quickly entered a consolidation phase. Gold registration, it is heard, has been extended for three days until the deadline. More physical gold is coming onto the market, and sentiment across the board is softening. This is also due to the weakness of Japanese military notes. In the morning, the market initially followed the upward momentum from the previous day's close, rising by 400 yuan and reaching the 19,000 yuan mark. It then fell to 18,900 yuan. A certain gold shop suddenly entered with strong buying, and Cheng Ji, De Fu, and retail investors also followed suit enthusiastically. The price was pushed up by 500 yuan, reaching a high of 19,400 yuan. Suddenly, He Fa came in with heavy selling, and Yong Feng Yu, Sheng Da, Yong Tong Kang Yong, and silver shop groups scrambled to sell. Hong Qing Yong Gong and others engaged in arbitrage. Cotton yarn prices plummeted, causing the price to fall by 1,000 yuan, reaching a low of 18,400 yuan at noon.

<h3>Cotton Yarn Registration Resumes; Selling Pressure on Double Horse Brand Increases</h3>
<p>Cotton yarn market conditions: Starting high, then falling, the trend has turned weak. This is because cotton yarn registration has resumed, causing a loss of confidence and a downward trend. The initial price for 20-count Double Horse brand yarn was 3,550 yuan, which rose to 3,630 yuan due to strong demand. However, some long position holders took advantage of the high price to sell, and selling pressure increased, gradually falling to 3,400 yuan at closing. 42-count Blue Phoenix was priced at 8,850-9,000 yuan, 60-count Li Ma at 10,300 yuan, 60-count Bull Head at 18,200 yuan, 60-count Cai Lu at 21,000 yuan, 40-count Jin Cheng at 8,000 yuan, 20-count Yue Qin at 4,425-4,500 yuan, 20-count Hong Kui Xing at 4,300 yuan, 20-count Tian Nu at 4,300 yuan, 20-count Double Globe at 4,390 yuan, 20-count Double Horse at 4,450 yuan, 20-count Wu Zi at 4,100 yuan, 20-count Blue Phoenix at 5,200 yuan, 16-count Hong Kui Xing at 4,400 yuan, 16-count Globe at 4,230 yuan, 16-count Jin Ta at 4,350 yuan, 17-count Cai Qiu at 4,200 yuan, 16-count Da Bao at 4,200 yuan, 10-count Hong Bao Yi at 2,900 yuan, 10-count Tong Zi Jun at 3,100 yuan, and 10-count Hong Double Horse at 3,140 yuan.</p>
<h3>Factory Cloth Sold for Profit; Selling Pressure Causes Prices to Fall</h3>

Longtou fine cloth new contracts opened at 218-219 yuan in the morning and softened to 210.05 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, they fell to 204 yuan twice, but the middle-range fine cloth and the spot Longtou dealers continued to absorb them, so the Longtou new contracts rebounded to 208 yuan at closing. Cai Qiu Fei Yu was 192.5 yuan, Yang He was 191.5 yuan, La Ba was 191 yuan, Wu Fu fine twill was 167 yuan, and Si Jun Zi serge late futures fell to 6.4 yuan. Hong Dan new tax was 6.26 yuan.</p>

Only horsehair lining has recently seen a price decrease. Previously sold at 3 yuan per yard, it is now only selling for 1.8 yuan, which can be said to be extremely rare.</p>

<h3>Speculation in Coarse Grains Slightly Slackens</h3>
<p>The coarse grain market remains dull, and speculation remains weak. Actual users are not buying aggressively, so the market continues to lack vitality. Bean prices have fallen by another 3-5 yuan, and bean cakes have also fallen by 2 yuan. The rest also show little sign of improvement. It is estimated that 100 bags of Kai Ping Hu Du beans were sold at 210 yuan, 20 bags of Pu Dong yellow beans at 201 yuan, Tianjin Jin Yuan 40 yuan at 227-228 yuan, and 300 bags of Yun beans at 220-215 yuan.

<h3>Cigarette Prices Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cigarette market situation: rumors of profitable buying were not strong, and various parties came to buy again. Holders took the opportunity to sell, so prices rebounded.

<h3>Apples (4)</h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>I brought it back and planted it. After three years, it bore five fruits. "The taste was like Nai (crabapple) and also like Lin Qin (another type of apple)," very juicy, exceptionally sour and delicious! I sent it to the county, and then to the state, because of its unique taste. Later, the tree grew large, bearing up to 300 fruits. Every year, I presented them as tribute, calling them "Zhu Nai." They still exist today. The states of De Bei Bo and others took its branches for grafting, resulting in abundant yields everywhere. People believed that they floated from the Western Regions, stopped by the shallows and settled there. This passage says, "The taste was like Nai and also like Lin Qin," clearly indicating that it was slightly different from both Nai and Qin; "called Zhu Nai" was because they didn't know what it was actually called, so they could only compare it to the names of existing fruits. If this isn't an apple tree, what else could it be? Assuming someone doesn't acknowledge that Nai is an apple, at least now they should acknowledge that we already had real apple trees in the Dao era! Furthermore, it says, "The states of De Bei Bo and others took its branches for grafting, resulting in abundant yields everywhere." This clearly records the reason why there are so many apple trees in Hebei Province now! This is truly a unique and excellent historical source!</p>
<p>The Tang Dynasty was the most flourishing period for translating Buddhist scriptures, and Buddhist terms were naturally most widely known at this time. Indeed, the term "Pin Po Guo" (apple) started precisely at this time. According to the "Taiping Guangji," quoting a book called "Qia Kai Ji," "During the Yonghui reign of the Tang Dynasty, Wang Fangyan, a villager from Wang Guo Village in Lin Huang, Wei Prefecture, once picked up a small tree on a river beach and planted it. When it grew, it turned out to be a Lin Qin. The fruit was larger than a small yellow gourd, white as jade, with vermilion spots... bright and dazzling, and exceptionally beautiful... He presented it to Emperor Gaozong, who named it Zhu Nai, also known as Five-Colored Lin Qin, or Lian Zhu Guo, and planted it in the imperial garden... The Emperor valued it greatly and bestowed the title of Wen Lin Lang upon Wang Fangyan. The local people call the fruit 'Pin Po Guo.' There are many Lin Qin trees in Hedong, and quite a few in Qin, as well as in the western prefectures, but all are smaller than the Wen Lin fruit." Zhenguan and Yonghui were the reign titles of Emperors Taizong and Gaozong of the Tang Dynasty, respectively. Dunqiu and Lin Huang were adjacent places. Is this passage about the same event as the one recorded in "Chaoye Qianzai"? I say, regardless, if they are two events, it is sufficient to show that the introduction of apple trees was not just a one-time occurrence. Even if it is the same event, it further proves the authenticity of this historical record, and we can also use this later record to solve the question of the origin of the name "Pin Po Guo." - Guo Qituo's "Zhong Shu Shu" already had the name "Pin Po," but I believe this book is clearly a forgery, so I don't take it into account.

<h3>The Story of "A Donkey in Tiger Skin"</h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>The trick of borrowing a name to swindle and deceive seems to have existed since ancient times, and is even more prevalent today. From holding the emperor hostage to command the lords to hawking light bulbs, all are variations of this trick. But since it is a trick, there is always some secrecy and furtiveness. If it succeeds, that is naturally best; if it fails, there is still room to cover up. To "wear a red cross armband and a copper badge" and engage in a fraudulent business in such a formal manner, it is certain that the case of borrowing the name of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Food Administration is the originator.</p>
<p>Today, when foreign rice is running out, domestic rice is as precious as pearls, and even buying red beans requires queuing, the act of "registering household food rations and distributing grain according to households" is naturally a welcomed and celebrated act of benevolence. However, where is the profit for these unscrupulous people? Is it just to swindle a few registration fees? There seems to be a subtle mystery that the newspaper does not fully disclose.</p>
<p>The inferior commoners who live day-to-day are indeed often unable to both queue and eat, and the higher-class residents whose rice bags are piled high at home and who still offer prices to rice brokers are also common. If a survey of all households in Shanghai is conducted today, in addition to those whose homes have no rice left, I think the second number will definitely exceed those "high-class collectors" who "have food stored for a month." They are just like the rice weevils of the past, thinking that as long as they are "fearless and unburdened," all will be well. The important reason for the appearance of the revised version of the story of "a donkey in tiger skin" probably lies in this.</p>
<p>The revised version of the story of "a donkey in tiger skin" is of course not just this case of "wearing a red cross armband and a copper badge." Where there is opportunity, there is no place that cannot be penetrated; however, it is precisely because there are "holes" that it is possible to teach the donkey the skill. Now, locking oneself in a rice warehouse is not the safest way. The recent implementation measures for food by the authorities of the two concessions have their own steps, and these steps are a universal "everyone has food to eat." Understanding this, the unscrupulous people will have no way to put on a tiger skin and act as a guide.</p>
<h3>Sickness and Rice</h3>
<p>— Wang Ye</p>
<p>There is an "advertisement" on the classified ads of this newspaper: "Zhang Fei of the Three Kingdoms once said to Kong Ming: I am not afraid of anyone. Kong Ming wrote the word 'sickness' on his palm and asked him if he was afraid or not? Fei shouted, 'Aiyo!' This shows that even heroes and strongmen cannot bear the suffering of life..." etc.</p>
<p>The price of rice during the Three Kingdoms period has not been accurately recorded in historical records, but the price of rice at several hundred yuan per dan must not have been within Kong Ming's divine calculations. Even if we say, "rice is up," rice still needs to be squeezed out, right? Zhang Fei had the prestige of scaring away Cao's soldiers at Hulin Bridge, so one sheng a day would not be a problem. Moreover, Zhang Fei may also have had a "rice squeezing party": Liu Bei, Guan Gong... A Dou, etc. But this "hero and strongman" actually "shouted Aiyo" when he saw the mere word "sickness," which shows that the terror of sickness at that time was a hundred million times greater than that of rice. Otherwise, why didn't old Mr. Kong Ming write the word "rice" on his palm?</p>
<p>Our twentieth-century "protagonists" overturned the "common view" that "a hero is only afraid of sickness grinding him down" and made a new conclusion, saying: "A hero is only afraid of having no rice." And there is still supporting evidence: that is, sickness can sometimes be delayed, but without food, a woman will die in seven days, and a "great husband" will be finished in three days.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat in Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(1) Sorrow and Joy</p>
<p>Someone went to his house and saw two slogans posted that seemed to make sense but didn't: "I will do anything to make money; I will not do anything that loses money." This statement doesn't exactly portray him. He and the Ye family later had some connections, because after Ye Aitang passed away, Ye's first wife handled the funeral and dealt with the debts. She sold more than 20 mu of farmland near the Wei family's residence to Wei Yunqing. Wei did not show any recollection of the embarrassment that Mr. Ye had given him during his lifetime. Instead, he made more than 20 payments, saying, "Money in hand, food in mouth. Mrs. Ye, you should take it slowly and spend it slowly."</p>
<p>Today, he suddenly came to the Ye family. Ye's second wife and Li Youxie, in their busyness, came out to greet him. They saw a short old man standing on the ground, wearing a big red wind hat and a black cloth mandarin jacket. It had five buttons, three of which were still fastened with copper grape buttons, but two were missing. One hand was lifting the front of his blue cloth gown, looking very heavy. Li Youxie forced a smile amidst his sorrow and asked, "Mr. Wei, where are you coming from? What are you carrying? Please sit down." Wei Yunqing sat down and smiled, "I'm back from my son-in-law's house. This is broken tiles and bricks that I picked up along the way. After picking them up for three years, I can build a public pit. Selling manure can also get a few dozen copper coins, enough for our Shao Yun to buy cigarettes. Mr. Li, I just walked past the door and heard Ye's long-term worker say that the eldest lady is gone. Is it true?" Ye's second wife said, "Yes, our eldest lady has passed away. Her son is not married, and the funeral arrangements have not been prepared." (34)</p>
<h3>The Price of Time</h3>
<p>— Ma Shang</p>
<p>"An inch of time is an inch of gold, but an inch of gold cannot buy an inch of time."</p>
<p>Time is precious.</p>
<p>Like asking the price of soap one hour, it is 220 yuan per case. Going to buy it an hour later, it is 223 yuan.</p>
<p>But Auntie Mao went to squeeze rice, queuing for four or five hours, hungry, and came back with empty hands. It turned out that the rice had been sold out, "Please come early tomorrow."</p>
<p>Thus, time has been divided into two prices.</p>
<h3>The Pain of Buying Bread</h3>
<p>— Wei Mo</p>
<p>The smooth and round bread, looking warm and tempting, is especially evocative today when rice is as expensive as pearls. Mentioning the word "bread" inevitably makes people feel a little "uncomfortable" in their mouths. The bread problem has been debated for a long time, but a proper solution has not been found. Now, even buying bread has become a painful thing. What else can be said?</p>
<p>Yes, places like Sullivan, Yili, Wing On, Sincere... etc., do sell bread. In normal times, when food is plentiful, one would rarely buy a loaf, and even then, it would have to be sandwiched with ham, sardines, or heavily smeared with white tower oil or jam before one would even consider eating it. Simply put, one wouldn't even glance at it. However, today, buying bread has entered the "squeezing" battle, and finding bread has become a specialized "skill."</p>
<p>"Bread Sold Out" - whether it's "sold out" or "finished selling," let's not worry about it. Every time I pass Yili or Sullivan, it always flashes before my eyes, as if "sold out" is the only thing that can be expressed about bread. Sometimes, I happen to see one or two loaves, well-wrapped and stored in the counter. These are the customers' deposits, and cannot be parted with.</p>
<p>So, I can only start looking for "miscellaneous brand" bread. Once, I saw a few French-style long loaves piled in the corner of a window in a candy store on Avenue Road. I went in and bought one, which felt quite light in my hand, and looked thin, surely "underweight." Sure enough, I casually put it on a scale, and the needle jumped around, always around nine taels, unable to even reach ten taels. The price was 1.5 yuan, which was a bit disappointing.</p>
<p>The so-called standard family bread, priced at 1.4 yuan per loaf, now requires at least 1.8 yuan to buy. A lighter material can be bought for 1.7 yuan. Where the standard is, customers are not clear, and everyone is only concerned with being able to buy, and will not study it in detail.</p>
<p>When the entire batch of bread arrives, everyone shouts and rushes to buy it, with dozens of hands raised high, like doing business in the market. Almost a group of regular customers have been waiting there for a long time at this time, waiting for the "honor." So, after a batch of bread is taken off the bread truck, it cannot wait to be placed in the window, and within a dozen minutes, it is bought up by those group customers.</p>
<p>The shops do not welcome this way of selling, as they feel that these surging customers are difficult to deal with, and if they are not handled well, some people can buy it and some can't, inevitably offending customers. As for the conversion of currency and the trouble of making change, the procedures are even more complicated.</p>
<p>Some stores have even created names such as "package delivery" and "special transport." Of course, they are all "sages of the times." Businessmen are quick-witted, so it's no wonder they take this route. But once you inquire about the prices under this system, you feel that the taste of bread is far worse than before, and it is even more difficult to swallow.</p>
<h3>New Reincarnation Education</h3>
<p>— Rooster</p>
<p>Nankai University in Tianjin had a "strike teaching" incident around 1922 and 1923. The reason was that there was an article on the school journal titled "Reincarnation Education," which roughly said: the way out for the educated is only to educate others again. I don't know if the professors at Nankai University at that time were too sensitive, thinking that it was sarcastic, and demanding that the school authorities punish the author. But they couldn't find out the real name of the author for a while, so the professors "struck teaching" to demonstrate. Over time, the four words "reincarnation education" have become popular and become colloquial. It is said that later not only did the author of "reincarnation education" jump out of reincarnation, but before the incident he had served as the director of the North China Unified Tax Bureau. And the professors who were referred to as reincarnated ones also "became officials after excelling in teaching." Or they became vice ministers and ministers, or ambassadors and secretaries general; at the very least, they became department chiefs and counselors. I think they can't help but smirk when they think of the scene of "blood surging" back then: "Reincarnation, indeed!" "Reincarnation, indeed!"</p>
<p>Times have changed, and the "way of reincarnation has also changed. My friend returned from studying in France, and neither "learned well to teach," nor "learned well to become an official," but spent all his time outside of sleeping, eating, and shitting in the dance halls. It is said that this is based on the latest principle of "learning well to dance," and he often criticizes "dance stars" based on "dance theory." Some friends who were skeptical deliberately rebutted him, but he was eloquent and persuasive. Not only were those present defeated, but even outsiders like me were impressed. Whenever there is a discussion, he can cite extensively and can take out several French dance books to prove it. He said very sincerely: "Don't think I'm fooling you because you don't understand French. Look, there are pictures to prove it! There are pictures to prove it!" Sure enough, my friends "learned to read from pictures" a long time ago, and now they have progressed to "learning to dance from pictures!" After many friends were instructed by him for free, they each became "highly skilled in dancing" and "fly with dance" day and night. My friend is not satisfied with this, and often says that when transportation is unimpeded in the future, he must go abroad to study "dance skills" in detail.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I had a dream that my friend had already returned from studying abroad again. He has written a book on dance hall management and the management of dance stars. Everyone calls him the Emperor of the Dance Country. After his advocacy, not only are dance halls everywhere, but all women dance, and no men don't dance. "Hearing the crow of the rooster, they dance," and it is even more prevalent now. Thus, China has the name of Dance Country, and the people have the title of Dance People. "Learning well to dance," and "dancing well to learn," round and round, "reincarnating" endlessly, not knowing that the East is already white.</p>
<h3>Summer</h3>
<p>— Qin Ren</p>
<p>According to yesterday's market:</p>
<p>Universal Balm: 600 yuan per dozen,</p>
<p>Mothballs: 12 yuan per pound,</p>
<p>Eau de cologne, medicated soap, mosquito coils... are all being "bought at high prices" in the classified ads.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>There is no summer in Shanghai this year!</p>
