<p>在我們今日看起來，這似乎是一件不可思議的事，爲什麼像俄國那樣武器齊備的堂堂的帝　竟爲剿滅少數原始民族而疲於奔命。現代的閃電戰術也許可以在頃刻間把他們的抵杭擊潰。然而我門貞得知道王野時候達革斯坦山峯上的堡壘村落旣不能用重砲的轟擊或空中的轟炸加以削半，而居於山林中的土番又非常巧妙地利用他們在廣大而人跡罕至的樹林中之巢窟，欲和他們接戰，簡直是一件不可能的事。俄軍猶如和幻影般的敵人爭鬥着，老是從他們面前倏然消失，卻叉神不知鬼不覺地威脅着他們的交通綫，每于俄軍疏於防備的時候實施偷襲，結果使士氣萎靡，而每一次可能的勝利往往突變爲潰敗。只有在土番們離開他們世代的檡木之保護時，俄軍才得偶然處於有利的地位</p>
<p>土番們絕命地死鬥着。他們除了爲保衛他們由來已久的自由外，更爲宗敎的熱狂所激發。同時須得注意的是，少數俄國將領因主張採用恐怖政策以圖消滅士番，結果使此項然狂更形熾烈。據一部分史家的意見，倘使俄將葉莫浴夫並未藉口士番的殘酷而進行極端的殘忍政策，那種叫做Murldism日的好戰的宗敎運動也許遠不會發生，而此項運動的領袖們也不至於使俄國疲於奔命到十九世紀的五十年代了。</p>
<p>俄國對新的保護地所探取的嚴峻的政策，也引起了絕大的不滿，終至於激起喬其亞各國的叛亂。然面俄國所負着的是極艱鉅的工作，因爲地理狀態適於羣小國及部落割據的這地方四分五裂巳經成爲司空見慣的局面。所以俄國最後終於能够在喬其亞完成統一大業。從事發展交通並介紹現代生活的技巧，這不能不認爲是一項偉大的成就。倘使任其自由發展，傾向無政府的奢侈而富有藝術天才的喬其亞人決不至於達於此項進步。</p>
<p>喬其亞的風氣—對於華美的衣着·瘋狂的舞踊·高唱古代之民謠的喧譁的饗宴之愛好，會感動往時無數的遊客，這包括八十年前出版的關於高加索的最古的遊記之一的作者。他有趣地描寫着有一次速續不斷地受喬其亞人的乾杯，使他窘迫不堪，結果飲得酩酊大醉</p>
<p>同書又描寫深山及孤谷的訪問記，在這裏曾居住着（並且現在仍居住着）無數世代來與外界完全隔絕的部落，他們穿帶鎖子甲上戰塲，並且又帶着種種奇形怪狀的古武器。</p>
<p>俄國的命令從未在這些土番間發揮多大的效力，而他們對俄國的敵愾心是非常頑强而趣向極端的。最嚴重的本件發生於一八一二年，這是俄國的勢力在高加索遭受最大威脅的一年。民衆的叛亂在喬其亞各地發生，而不久所有的山中部落都聯合一致反抗數年前會那麼受歡迎的救星。微倖俄國於緊要關頭與土斗其成立和約；一八一三年對土番之根據地沙蒂而的進剿使局勢轉危爲安；及至一八一六年葉莫洛夫來此就任最高司令官的時候，秩序巳完全恢復了。</p>
<p>無疑地，葉莫洛夫是當時俄國最傑出的將領之一。在他的國人眼光中，他老是在許多被遺至高加索的著冬之將領中佔着第一位；他的所以孚衆望，不但楚因爲他在戰塲的屢戰屢勝，並且是因爲他對於部下的愛護有加；同時他的奇特之性癖和獨特的見解更提高了他的地位。所謂獨特的見解包括他對當時在俄國宮廷盛行的德國勢力所表示的明顯的蔑視。他徼倖得與一位叫做維里民諾夫的參謀長共事，他不論在才幹上·敎養上·以及軍事知識上都較葉莫洛夫勝似一籌，可是葉莫洛夫無疑地楚更受人欽仰的人物。</p>
<p>葉莫浴夫屢次出征的最大目的是救平土人的不滿和貳心以免俄國有南顧之憂，道當然是無法加以非議的；可是我們也同樣無法否而一八二六年承繼其後被遺的巴斯基維區將軍所發的許多批評。他說，倘使葉莫洛夫曾顯示更大的機智和仁慈，他自身的工作以及他後繼者的工作將變成更共輕便，而一般無辜者所蒙受的磨難和因苦也可大形减輕了。</p>

<h3 id="c48">兵荒馬亂中上海的吉普賽人音樂天才所至有聲階級區別極爲複雜 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>上海是個國際性的都市，在這裹，可以見到世上各地的人民，國藉多至數十種，有些是經商來滬，更有許多卻是流浪到這任意入境的通商大埠來的，流浪僑民，似自俄爲最多，他們被赤俄逐出後，才飄泊到此，倒也安居樂業，只是北望故國，欲歸不得。其次是猶太人，近年被逐出歐洲，才有大批擁到上海，他們的賺錢本領最精，給人的印象，比自俄更甚。可是還有一種流浪來滬的人民，安份守己，不問外事，在「羅曼蒂克」的氛圍裹生活着，旣沒有領事保護，又沒有總會或協會代表其利益，這便吉是普賽人。</p>
<p>提起吉普賽人，腦海裹便現出這種流浪人民，穿着花花綠綠的服裝，載歌載舞的印象。上海的吉普賽人約有四百人，多數住在法租界金神父路四週房租較廉的區域裹，在這裹隨時可見到身穿鮮紅翠緣的大裙子，雙眸漆黑明媚，皮膚黑幽幽的女子，一望而知是吉普賽人。每天晚上，你經道聖母院路霞飛路口常有吉普賽女子將你喚住，請你伸出手掌，相騐掌紋，代價不過一元。吉普賽女子操此業的，世界各地都有，似乎是很出名的。然而她們也不過是憑幾句江湖口訣，博得顧客一點空洞的滿意而已。她們也許會說你終有一天榮任銀行大老闆，或某著名女明星的愛人，不然，便說你子孫滿堂，老境彌佳。更有些吉普賽女子，以「預言家」自命，租屋營業，門上掛着小招牌，上書每天午後四至八時，歡迎顧客，聽說，上海很有些上流社會的西婦，相信吉普賽女子的</p>
<p>「預言」，常去問敎，取費當然較昂，大約每次至少廿元。</p>
<p>吉普賽人雖是生活閒散的流浪人民，可是在這生活程度極高的上海，也不免爲麵包，茶酒和衣住等項的費用而操心。也許吉普賽人生來有音樂天才，所以上海有不少吉普賽舞蹈家，歌唱家和音樂家，活躍在夜總會裹，很受歡迎。問樣是沒有國家的流浪人民，猶太人是憑到處的經商本領生活，毫厘必較。吉普賽人卻祇携一蔓提零，浪跡天涯，寸步不離，只要袋裹有錢，便儘量找尋歡樂，情願弄得臺中空空，再想辦法。</p>
<p>上海的吉普賽人，從前也曾自設夜總會，興奮熱鬧，甲於全滬，營業自然極盛，只是幾個吉普賽董事，不懂得積聚，終至不能維持。可是，各　總會僱有吉普賽人奏藝的，至今還能吸引許多顧客。</p>
<p>吉普賽女郎另有一種媚人的魔力，假如你和她相識，而竟携她上當影院等處游樂，那末，她的父親必然跟踪找來，向你發嚴重的警吿，甚至勵起武來，扭入據房。原來她們決不許嫁予外族人，所以吉普賽人的血統，最稱純粹。然而上海的吉普賽人，多數屬於三大族，時常發生莫明其妙的族鬥。法租界警員往往在黑暗的角落裏，發現两個喝得醉醺醺的吉普賽人，互相兇毆，詰問起來，卻毫無理由，只是兩族不和而巳，警務方面對於這種毆鬥瑣事，當然訓斥了事。然而這兩個吉普賽人中，必有一僩巳吃了眼前虧，於是哭訴族人報複，甚至挾兇器狙擊對方族人，因此族鬥事件，層出不窮，永無休止。至於少果少女，當然只和友族論婚嫁，吉普賽人旣有羅曼蒂克的天性，所以靑年男女聞像「羅密歐與朱　業」一般纏綿的戀愛把戲，也特別的流行。</p>
<p>上海的吉普賽人，雖很稀少，內部却極複雜，除族的紛爭外，還有深刻的階級制度劃分着。原來吉會賽人有三種遺傳的社會階級，各營巳業，不和他業相交往，這便是音樂家，養熊玩把戲的人和鍋匠。有些吉普賽人的幾代祖先，早巳不幹這行當，可是他的後裔還承繼着這社會上的階級區別，不能脫離。有些吉普賽人視巳族的社會地位，高於他人，不免本能地露出傲然氣概。尤其是在上海，還有第四種吉普賽人，直接來自印度，大多一貧如洗，居住在蘇州河以北的破敗房屋中，苟延殘喘，其他吉普賽人恥與他們爲伍，不顧與之交談。</p>
<p>多數吉普賽人，都從匈牙利，羅馬尼亞或俄羅斯南部流落到東方，沿途所經各國，查騐護照向很嚴緊，可是吉普賽人根本沒有護照，竟然一路混了過來。先到哈爾濱，藉夜總會的繁盛，得以謀生，但吉普賽人從小流浪慣了，不耐久居一地，於是沿海南下，經過靑島和天津等埠，終抵上海，更有些從匕海出發，向內地流浪，遠達漢口，但不久叉返上海，也許這裏是他們心目中的人問天堂。</p>
<p>散居在歐洲各地的官警賽人，共約四十萬，他們的祖先，原是奴你，大約在中世紀經韃靼入釋放後，才紛紛從印度或中亞細亞向歐洲移居，有些史家則認爲吉普賽人最早的卜居地是埃及，不久便散佈到整個歐洲，以至今日，無論是西班牙，丹麥，美國和南美洲，都有他們的蹤跡，因爲他們在天涯地角，到處為家，所以精通各地的方言，例如上海的吉普賽人，能操俄，英，法，匈，羅語，甚至華，德，義，以至印度語。</p>
<p>吉普賽人對於政治，素不過遇，所關心的，祇選舉吉普賽王和每年一度在卡瑪格舉行的吉普賽人大會兩事。現任的吉普賽人統治者是五年前在波蘭平原某地舉出的米契爾二世，他旣無國家，又無宮殿皇冠，卻在歐洲的公路上流浪着，而那些重臣，也忠心保駕」，跟着米契爾二世到處飄泊，一切大事，總在歐洲吉普賽人每年聚會於未瑪格時決定。卡瑪格在瑞士倫河口的平原上，吉普賽人相傳耶穌受難後，聖母瑪利亞等三女在這裹登岸，其中一個黑膚女子，便是吉普賽的祖先，所以他們每年趕到此地集會，載歌載舞，儘情狂歡，以資紀念。年來歐洲兵荒馬亂，交通阻隔，所以卡瑪格的吉普賽人大會，也舉行不成了。</p>

<p>小談</p>
<h3 id="c70">本屆助學金的幾點感想 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— 月</p>
<p>本報第三屆助學金的辦理情形，大致巳見報載，這裹，我們所要說的，是幾點感想。</p>
<p>這一次辦理甄別試騐，雖然是手續繁劇，可是得到珍貴的村料，卻是不少，全部試題，將在核准名單公布完畢後揭布，供各校學生的參考，在甄別試騐的時候，秩序很良好，假如一般的學生，在舉校裹都具有如此良好的學風，我們眞該慶幸，事實或許未必盡然的，可是所能證明的，「淸寒優秀」，卻是事實，那富家子弟，在學校中應考，成續的表現，我們是未敢預料，但是精神的嚴肅，當有逮不及此之感。</p>
<p>試題中中學常識部分，曾以第三期戶口米糧，每人若千作爲測騐之一，這雖然似乎平凡的測騐，卻是我們調查學生家庭狀況的有力旁證，換一句話，如果答復得距離很遠的學生，其家庭就未必十分淸寒，此外對於衛生也有測騐，我們的微意，希望各生雖因家境淸寒，對於食物的營養，促其注意。</p>
<p>就一般考試情形來看，各校所記的分數，似乎　有寬嚴之別，比較可靠的標準，辦理較嚴各學校的學生，都能成績斐然，很少落選的，反之，課程較低的管敎較鬆的，及格的百分比，就自然降落，而且收費較貴的學校，未必就是管敎嚴格的學校，這些事實的顯示，所予我們助學工作的敎益甚多，同時對於各校今後施敎，或許也有些幫助。</p>
<p>各生的作文，好的固然不少，但是一般的水準，我們也有未能滿意之感，我們覺得各生作文，有不少是內容缺乏實質，「我的讀書經騐」「我的暑期生活一這些題目，應該是有具體的指出，而不應該議論多於事實，有用的文字，不能離聞事實，離　事實的文字，不値重視，也不是我們所希望於諸生的。</p>
<p>測騐的結果，就是核准助學余的名單，這中間有的成績及格，而家庭經濟，尙堪應付的，爲鄭重助學金的用途，不予核准。也有的家庭十分淸寒，甚至放學回家以後，佐理雜務，無暇自修的，衡情酌理，相當予以助金，換句話說，惟淸寒而優秀之學生，方合助金的標準，優秀而不十分清寒，當在不准之列，我們希望下屆助學金舉辦時，非淸寒者不必申請，清寒的都是優秀，雖然助金的數目，或許不敷應付申請者的請求，我們確信各界捐輸的人終能盡力以彌此缺憾。</p>

<h3 id="c71">甘地——印度的靈魂 <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— 胡悲</p>
<p>爲了主持印度的積極獨立運動，甘地，那個短小瘦削的棕色身體卜，襄着一塊土自布的聖雄，和印度其他獨立運動的領袖，又被英國政府所逮捕了。這個古怪的七十一一歲的老頭子，知道這千載一時的機會，一縱即逝，所以不惜拚着老命，上爲三萬萬五千萬被累迫的同胞爭取解放與自由。印度未來的運命，有一大部份是要由此次的事件決定的。</p>
<p>萬衆的偶像</p>
<p>在印度，甘地早已成爲萬衆的偶像了。成千成萬簡陋的茅舍裹，都似懸掛着他的像片爲榮；小孩病了，焦急得走頭無路的大人”就用甘地的照片來代表良藥，希望能醫好他。他的火車所過之處，農民們不遠數十里，特地距去鐵路旁恭候，雖　火車並不停，甘地也不會出與他們招呼，但是他們也情願這樣做。他要演講了，隔夜就有成千的聽衆到會塲上去佔好位子。他走過的地方，農民們爭着跪下去吻他的脚印所過之處全印度可說是都着了甘地迷了。</p>
<p>「甘地」這兩字，在印度話是「伙食商」意思。印度民衆爲了崇拜他，尊他爲一瑪哈瑪，」意思楚偉人的靈魂。」也有許多親　他的人，稱他爲」爸布，」意思是父親。早年的時候，家叫他做「拜伊，」是弟兄的意思。還有許多人稱他做「甘地子，」子字是先生之意，但是附帶着一種親愛之感至於譏會中的人，常叫他做他們的「高級指揮」</p>
<p>非武力反抗</p>
<p>甘地早年　倡議非武力的反抗，這是一種不合作運動，有許多人誤會爲不抵抗主義，其實是大錯而特錯，因爲不抵抗與非武力反抗，兩者相差甚遠。他對參加非武力反抗者的誡條是：不發怒，不辱駡，被擊時不反抗，被捕時東手就縛，決不侮辱敵人他甚至要他的門徒幫助被不遵命令的印人襲擊的英國軍警他痛恨暴力，他也痛恨以暴易暴，可是他以爲有、樣東西是　暴力史壞的，那就是懦怯。</p>
<p>爲了發起這前所未聞的非武力不服從運動，他屢次被捕入獄。他入獄　次數和在獄中居住的日子，連他自己也說不淸有多少。早年仁南菲做律師的時候，就有三次被捕入獄，一九二二年爲了發動不合作運動，被捕受寨的時候，他以最懇切的態度，要求寨判官處似最重的刑罰，自以爲不是這樣，就無以贖自己的罪。審判官在宣讀判決文的時候，爲表不對這囚犯的敬意起見，特別起立，判他徒刑六中。甘地在聞悉判詞以從，很客氣地向寨判官表示謝意。法庭上這樣彬彬有禮的戲劇　可說是世所僅見。事實上甘地對於入獄，毫無畏怯或不願的表示，可說是視入獄如家常便飯。他平常事務紛繁，入獄是他唯　休息與寫作　良機。他自己說他在獄中「如烏兒樣快活。」、</p>
<p>絕食的意義</p>
<p>說到甘地入獄，便自然而然地要提到他絕食了。因爲他每次遭遇什麽他以爲不幸的事情，總是以絕食表示懺悔之意。英國政府對於甘地的絕食，尤感頭痛，因爲他每次在獄中絕食，總是引起全世界的注意，絕食到末了，因爲他身體虛弱了，英國政府總是不得不把他釋放出來，以免有小測的事發生。因爲英政府深知甘地不能死，尤其不能在英國人的獄中死；不然的話，全印度便將陷入無法控制的狀態中了。一九二一年，有一次，在實行非武力反抗的時候，羣衆不能自制，襲擊並焚斃英警，甘地聞之，爲之傷心慘目，稱這次的事什爲「像希瑪拉雅山一樣的大錯誤」於是立刻停止不合作運動，舉行第一次的大絕食，表示悔罪之意。一九二五年，因爲印回敎徒發生大衝突，甘地爲了促雙方的覺悟起見，叉絕食了二十一禾，幾乎致命。到了末了一天，才飲橘汁少許，衰弱得運話也小能說了。後來他又有一次爲印度最低階級的民衆而大絕食二十一天。還有一次，據說因爲他的一個女門徒，與二十一個同志通姦，事情彼他發覺了，他眞是傷心非凡，結果除了把那位女弟子同二十一個同志全部開除似外，自己再絕食二十一天，以示爲二十　人懺罪之意。　據有人說，那位女弟子如果冉多與幾人通姦，甘地也許有絕食至死的危險。</p>
<p>素食主義者</p>
<p>爲了受印度敎的影響，甘地早年就是個紫食主義者。當他在倫敦　法科的時候，他已經是倫敦素食會的一個執行委員了。據說他年輕的時候，有一個崩友吿訴他說，英國人所以强壯，就是因爲吃肉的緣故，印度人所以衰弱，也許就是因爲吃素所致。因此就決心用自己做試騐品，吃了一頓羊肉，結果心中作惡，當晚被夢魔所擾，夢見有一隻活羊在他肚中不斷地咩咩亂叫，他從此以後，就不敢再吃，疾肉如仇了。</p>
<p>甘地雖然是個素食主義者，而目動不動就要絕食，但是事實上他的胃口並不算小。他每頓所吃的，包括羊奶一杯，蜂蜜一匙，此外有棗子，硬殼菓，蒜頭，橘子，波羅蜜，芒果，桃子等物。平時羊奶是他的主要食物，他在日落以後，是不吃鹽，茶，及餐的。</p>
<p>虔誠的敎院</p>
<p>甘地楚個虔誠的敎徒，每天晨昏都件禱吿一次。有時候什任何會議塲上，祇要他認爲時候已到，他就不管共他切，席坐地上，開始他的禱吿。在英國的下議院委員會空中，他的這種莽撞行爲，曾經引起英國紳士夭大的驚異。星期一是他例行的靜默日期，無論有甚麽重大的事件，他總是閉口不言，遵守不渝。但是假使你要問甘地所相信的是什麽敎，恐怕誰也沒法子說出來。我想還是讓他用自己的話來表現吧。他說。。「我看見四週的萬物不斷地改變，不斷地死亡，在所有的改變之下，有一個水不改變的活的力量，在組織一切，創造一切，解散一切。那個賦予一切以生命的力量和神黨，就是上帝。我以為上帝是聖潔仁愛的，因爲我看得出，　死亡當中，生命還是永存不滅；在不誠實的中間，眞理還是有續着；在黑暗的中問，光明繼續堅持下去。因此，我推論上帝是生命，眞理，和光明。止帝是愛，是超等的善」。他是一個熱心的印度敎徒，但是他相信世界上一切偉大的經典，都一樣是上帝的話。</p>
<p>甘地所最愛的，楚兒童，新鮮的空氣，歡笑，朋友，和眞理。最恨的是說慌。</p>
<p>化自己爲零</p>
<p>甘地有一本很長的自傳，在寫了一千零九十頁以後，他的末了一句話是：「我必須化自己爲零。」世界上的一切花，草，五穀等植物的種籽，必須在「把自己化爲零」以後，才能有新的生命生長出來，才匪有豐富的收穫。在這印　的獨立運動成敗的關鍵中，甘地自傳中的末了一句話，是尤其値得令人玩味的。</p>

<p>— 呂浣杳</p>
<p>白練三千丈</p>
<p>當做完半個月的日班後，照例該輪値夜班了，日入而出，日出而息，長長的十二小時，足够你去喊「畏夜漫漫何時息」？在十二點以前，伙伴們總是精神煥發不稍假息的；但到了午夜以後，其實是翌晨了，尤其是二點鐘到五點鐘的光景，每個同伴都露著倦意。最感到支撐不住的是兩隻眼睛了，其實也難怪她，在耀目的電燈光下，擠着眼珠兒，注意每一根細合半根頭髮的絲綫，折斷了，結起來，逃走了，找出來，不得一忽兒疎忽。有幾個同伴閉起眼簾打肫兒，眞是好笑，緯組繼完了，她小知道，或楚做了一個蓬洞，她還是小知道；發覺了，只好自認霉氣，把有疵的梭一棱際去，這些費去的時光，正是收入的損失，打盹兒代價。有幾位有經騐的，便不同了，她們很機警，會在緯綫將完的一剎那驚醒過來，毫無意外。更有幾位想避免打盹兒，振作起精神，提高了嗓子，循着機杼的拍奏吟調兒：有的向鄰機的伙伴開玩笑，居然談笑風生，把盹兒魔驅個乾凈。而我常常向這隻川流不息的流鶯望着發呆，禁不住喊著，你一爲誰辛苦爲誰忙？」</p>
<p>「白練三千丈」，大概在一年內可以完工，假使有三四叫年歷史的織女，至少就有一萬丈的成績，假定每襲衣料的長是一丈，那麽她已替世界卜做了一萬件衣料。當然有一萬個人的衣服，是由她的手下一絲一縷地所織成的。</p>
<p>「一曲蠻歌一東綾，美人猶自意嫌輕，知否織女寒窗下，多少工夫織得成？」這是一首古織女寫的憤慨的時。自然，一股太太小姐們朝史夕換，衣櫥裏掛得琳琅滿目，只要享受得舒適，又怎會知道一絲一縷，都是織女們的血淚呢？</p>
<p>織女們的生活大概情形巳經說完了，最後我還有一點感想：絲織業在中國，楚具有最悠久的歷史的，現在雖然比從前的手織業已進步多多了，但是與世界各國一比，眞是相形見拙，小巫見大巫了。蘇俄有二萬五千台織機的大工廠，在中國就壓根兒沒有。到現在爲止，綢緞商還是以運自歐美作號召，這是我們全中國的絲織從業員應認爲恥辱的事。我們每一個從業員正應如何埋頭苦幹，精益求精，求洗刷我們的辱恥，同時也爲了振興我們的實業，尤其對於在絲織業界有地位有實力的領導者，我們寄託着深厚的願望。（全篇完）</p>

<p>（八）奈若何</p>
<p>這一晚，葉二太太在牀上，也是把耳朶堅起了，直等天亮，才朦朦睡着。這又是一天了，並沒有人去驚動葉二太太，可是葉二太太忽然驚醒。醒過來喚道：「維城，你來，陳小姐怎麽對你哭的？」翠珍才走在房外，聽的詫異，走進去一看，只葉二太太一個人，惺忪着雙眼在說話。翠珍笑道：「二伯母，城弟沒回來呀，你這麽說是他回來了？」葉二太太一怔，也勉强笑道：」我在做夢，像是維城吿訴我，說陳小姐對他哭。原來是夢。維城到底回來了沒有；雪消了沒有；天晴了沒有？」翠珍一句句都答覆了她，她又是生愁，說：「昨天怎麽會想不到喚何子與往變橋跑一趟，何子興去了，今天早有了實信·」</p>
<p>翠珍還能把別人想不到的事想到，她在今天的淸晨，已然派何子興往　橋去了；在何子興的眼光襄看，翠珍在葉家是什麽地位，道固爲翠珍所不及知，可是何子興非常的服從命令，翠珍要他去，他就去了。所以葉二太太在後悔，翠珍就據實報吿了她。</p>
<p>又是像昨天一樣，忽然的到了中午，忽然的到了傍晚，在天寒日短的時量，葉二太太和翠珍，老是度日如年。到了傍晚，維城和阿興沒回來，何子興倒是回來了，他雖是一個長工，是站在傭侯一條線上，可是當他到了籬門之外，葉二太太等便迎出去。只有何子興脚上的泥漿，直濺釗腿彎以上，就看出他辛勞的成續來。他見了主母，說道：「少爺和阿與，都沒有在雙橋陳家呀。」　（一五三）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Suppressing the Indian Independence Movement: Britain Imposes Special Martial Law; All Disturbing Public Order Will Be Subject to Flogging; British-Indian Conflict Incidents Continue to Erupt <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Bombay, November 11th, Havas News Agency: In the past twenty-four hours, turmoil has continued unabated throughout India. The tense emotions of the people have spread everywhere. In many places, clashes have occurred between demonstrators and the police. The situation in various places is recorded as follows: Madras City: According to an official communiqué, order was disrupted in various thoroughfares, forcing the police to open fire to suppress it. Bombay City: The police opened fire on demonstrators, reaching ten times in one day, resulting in the deaths of thirteen civilians and injuries to thirty. As for the exact number of casualties on the 9th of this month, it is said to be twenty-eight dead and two hundred injured. Patna City: A crowd demonstrated near the provincial government and was dispersed by police firing, resulting in five deaths and nineteen injuries. The Governor of Bombay Province, Sir Roger Lumley, delivered a broadcast speech to the people today, stating roughly: "Public demonstrations cannot prevent the government from implementing its established policies. I cannot sit idly by and watch this chaotic situation continue. All police and soldiers have been ordered to take severe measures when necessary. The authorities have ordered the implementation of special martial law throughout India, stipulating that anyone who disturbs public order will be subject to flogging. As of now, the number of people arrested and flogged has already exceeded several hundred.</p>
<p>Bombay, November 12th, Havas News Agency: The Governor-General's Office of India issued a communiqué today stating that riots continue to occur throughout India. In New Delhi, the situation became serious after textile factory workers staged a demonstration yesterday morning. Railway bureau offices were looted, and several tax bureau desks were forcibly opened. The military police repeatedly opened fire on rioting crowds. A Muslim deputy inspector was executed by rioters. Many textile factory workers and students were arrested. A curfew has been implemented throughout the city, and gatherings of more than five people are prohibited. Large numbers of troops have been deployed in the city to suppress the unrest, and troops are patrolling the streets. In Poona, demonstrators broke into the police station building, destroying equipment and looting files. Firecrackers were set off in major streets, and electric light signals were destroyed. Obstacles were scattered everywhere, several telegraph and telephone lines were cut, and buses were overturned, causing traffic chaos. In the Surrounding area of Poona, police charged at crowds. In Nasik, demonstrators attempted to seize arrested individuals, and the police opened fire, dispersing the crowd, with one person injured. In Karachi, demonstrators threw bricks at the police, injuring several officers, who immediately charged, injuring forty-two rioters. In Bombay, the situation this morning was slightly calmer than yesterday, with only a few minor incidents occurring. Demonstrators picketed outside Barton Gar station to prevent workers from going to the factories but were quickly dispersed by troops. Last night, fifty people were arrested for violating curfew regulations. This morning, police in Ahmedabad opened fire on demonstrating crowds, who responded by throwing bricks at the police. In Bassein, Thana district, rioters demonstrated in front of government agencies, and the police opened fire, killing one person and injuring several others, and order was quickly restored.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, November 12th, Allied News Agency: The area under martial law in India was expanded yesterday. The British authorities have also mobilized troops and constabulary to assist the police in suppressing the riots. Since the riots broke out in various places last Sunday, the exact number of casualties is unknown, but it is known that approximately two hundred people have died. According to Reuters, over five hundred Indian people have been arrested, but the people's movement is still underway and has not yet reached its peak.</p>
<p>Bangkok, November 12th, Haitong News Agency: The center of the Indian people's resistance against Britain has shifted from Bombay to New Delhi. Elite British troops are strictly guarding the city, protecting government agencies and the Governor-General's residence. Thousands of workers in New Delhi have participated in strikes. Despite the suppression by military police, they refuse to return to work. British goods are being burned in the streets, and police stations and tax bureaus have also been attacked. Many workers and students have been arrested. The military police also opened fire on crowds. Only after reinforcements were dispatched did the crowds disperse. New Delhi is no different from a military camp. Similar clashes have occurred in Poona, Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Madras, Madurai, and Agra. British military police have also opened fire on demonstrating crowds. The administrative office in Poona was bombed, and telephone and electric light wires were also cut. Several demonstrations and marches have occurred in Bombay, and workers are also on strike. It is said that in the past two days, eighty-seven Indian people have been killed, over 1,200 injured, and over 2,000 arrested.</p>
<p>Saigon, November 12th, Haitong News Agency: A telegram from Bombay last night stated that another bloody conflict had occurred there between British and Indian forces. British military police have been ordered to use firearms, and civilian casualties are increasing daily. Yesterday, police charged into the central district of Bombay to suppress the riots. According to an official British announcement, there were seven deaths and twenty-seven injuries in Bombay yesterday afternoon. A clash also occurred in Patna, where crowds were demonstrating to protest the arrest of Congress leaders. Police suddenly opened fire, killing three people and injuring twenty. The exact number of casualties in Bombay on Sunday and Monday is currently unknown. However, the British side has acknowledged that there were at least sixteen deaths and at least 114 injuries in Bombay alone on Monday. The British government's oppressive measures have caused the riots to become more widespread. Police stations and government offices are frequently vandalized or set on fire by the people. Indian students are secretly distributing Congress Party propaganda leaflets, urging the people to continue resisting the British oppressors.</p>
<p>Saigon, November 12th, Haitong News Agency: According to a message from Bombay last night, the Governor of Bombay Province, in view of the Indian people's violent actions, broadcast on the radio yesterday, appealing to the Indian people, stating that he could no longer tolerate the continuation of the riots and that the military police had been ordered to take severe action. According to an official British announcement, there were twenty-eight deaths and two hundred injuries in Bombay. Yesterday, after British police opened fire on demonstrating Indians, thirteen were killed and thirty injured. Similar riots also occurred in New Delhi.</p>
<p>Saigon, November 12th, Haitong News Agency: The anti-British movement in India continues to spread, and more areas in India were declared under martial law yesterday. Bloody incidents continue to occur in Bombay, with British military police opening fire on demonstrating civilians multiple times a day. Due to strict British censorship, the details of casualties on both sides, British and Indian, are unknown. Last night, the British in New Delhi issued an official communiqué stating that its national regular army would participate in opening fire on unarmed civilians. The police station in the Matunga district of Bombay was set on fire and burned by civilians yesterday, causing traffic on the streets of Bombay to come to a complete standstill. British-made clothing and items were piled up and destroyed by fire on several streets. According to Reuters, a certain district of Bombay was controlled by demonstrators but has now been retaken by British military police.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a crowd attempted to set fire to the municipal hall in New Delhi, but it was prevented by military police. Military police are currently patrolling the area to protect it.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Naval Battles Still Ongoing Near the Solomon Islands <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, November 12th, Haitong News Agency: The U.S. Navy Department announced this morning that naval battles are still ongoing in the Solomon Islands. Details cannot be disclosed at this time. It also stated that there had been small-scale activity by the U.S. Navy and Air Force in the Aleutian Islands.</p>
<p>Rome, November 12th, Haitong News Agency: According to Admiral Soza Intsugi of the Japanese Navy, in an interview with the Tokyo correspondent of the Italian newspaper, the great battle in the Solomon Islands demonstrates a change in the war situation. In May, we had to send escort fleets to New Guinea because we were unable to control the sea and air. Today, the British must send escort fleets and head down the path of ruin. In this battle, the Japanese army first adopted a defensive posture and then switched to an offensive one. The cessation of hostilities in New Guinea is because the Japanese army needs to consolidate the islands it has already occupied in Papua.</p>

<h3 id="e4">Latest News from Department Stores Citywide: The Number of Retailers Selling the No. 500 Toothbrush Will Exceed One Thousand After Its Launch <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>There are over a thousand department stores and tobacco shops in this city selling Liangxinj Toothbrushes of all sizes. Among them, the number of retailers selling the No. 500 toothbrush will exceed one thousand as of recently. It has been found that this toothbrush has been welcomed by society in less than a month since its launch because of its exquisite style, suitable for both men and women, and comfortable to use for brushing teeth, without any feeling of clumsiness or inappropriateness to the structure of the teeth. Moreover, the bristles are neither too soft nor too hard, and do not damage tooth enamel, which is especially suitable for the principles of dental hygiene. It is also durable and does not shed bristles, while still maintaining the original unique style of Liangxinj.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Deep Concern in American Political Circles <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, November 11th, Allied News Agency: According to news arriving there via Amsterdam, the chaotic state of India has aroused great anxiety and concern in the United States. Most American church newspapers have expressed approval of the British authorities' oppressive policies towards the Congress Party. However, another part of the newspapers believes that this measure by the British authorities has instead given the Indian people an excuse to carry out a disobedience movement, and therefore strongly criticized this rash action by the British authorities. What American political and military circles are most concerned about is that the disturbances in India will have an extremely adverse impact on the Allied war effort. According to a commentary in the New York Times, the Allies have very high expectations regarding India's cooperation in the war, and America's destiny is closely linked to India's development.</p>
<p>New York, November 12th, Havas News Agency: The Indian League in the United States today passed a resolution protesting the arrest of leaders such as Gandhi and Nehru and appealing to President Roosevelt to intervene. The resolution also stated that the league firmly believes that Britain's barbaric policies, which suppress the Indian national liberation movement, are bound to lead to tragedy, and that the only hope for resolving the Indian problem will inevitably be diminished by this. The resolution also holds Sir Stafford Cripps responsible for the deterioration of the situation to this point, as his trip to India failed to reduce the dictatorial powers of the Governor-General of India.</p>

<h3 id="e8">Chongqing Newspapers Comment on Indian Events <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, November 11th, Allied News Agency: According to a Reuters dispatch from Chongqing, Chongqing newspapers were initially quite subdued regarding the Governor-General of India's suppression of the National Congress Party. However, on the 11th, all newspapers uniformly published editorials commenting on the Indian problem, expressing great regret over the British suppression and the deterioration of the situation in India. For example, the Chongqing official newspaper, the Central Daily News, stated: "We were deeply saddened to receive news of the arrest of Gandhi, Nehru, and Azhar. At this critical juncture, we are deeply concerned about the deterioration of British-Indian relations. India today has the greatest impact on Britain's anti-Allied war effort. Whatever the cause of this current predicament, we cannot support the actions of the Indians, for the fact is that it will lead to political failure. Although the Indians have been fighting for freedom under the guidance of Gandhi, Nehru, and others for twenty years, if the situation in India is allowed to continue to deteriorate today, it will affect the entire Pacific war situation. Therefore, we sincerely hope that both the British and Indian authorities will seek an appropriate solution with patience." Also, the Yishi Bao stated that the Governor-General of India's oppressive measures only serve to increase the Indians' resentment and do nothing to resolve the predicament. We deeply regret this. The Guomin Gongbao also stated that India's demand for freedom is not contrary to the war aims of the Allies, and it is the British's duty to accept their demands. We firmly believe that the wise politicians of Britain and America will not forget the principles they set forth in the Atlantic Charter.</p>

<p>Rome, November 12th, Haitong News Agency: According to photos published in this newspaper yesterday, important areas along the Italian coast are protected by special armored trains, equipped with cannons and military equipment. These trains were used to protect the Adriatic coast during World War I and are now used to protect certain other coasts. Berlin, November 12th, Haitong News Agency: The German High Command issued a supplementary communiqué yesterday, detailing the sinking of several enemy ships by German submarines, as reported in yesterday's special German war bulletin. It stated that on the afternoon of August 5th, a German submarine in the North Atlantic spotted an enemy convoy and immediately telegraphed its base. All German submarines within 300 miles were ordered to prepare for an attack. That evening, a 5,000-ton cargo ship was torpedoed and sunk. Although many submarines participated in the attack, the dense fog covering the sea made it difficult to identify targets. Our submarines were repeatedly chased away by enemy destroyers. The next morning, the visibility was even worse, making it difficult to distinguish objects within 500 meters. Our submarines almost collided with enemy destroyers from time to time. Although the enemy dropped many depth charges, our submarines continued to pursue them closely. By noon on the 7th, the dense fog gradually dissipated, and the targets gradually became visible, but just as an attack was about to be launched, the sudden arrival of dense fog made it impossible to start for a while. At 5:30 a.m. on August 8th, a second cargo ship (7,000 tons) was sunk. Before long, another two ships, totaling 15,000 tons, sank to the bottom of the sea. Soon after, a 7,000-ton cargo ship sank after being damaged. At that time, the visibility continued to deteriorate. On the morning of the 9th, a German submarine damaged a destroyer. On the morning of the 10th, the German submarines launched a final attack, sinking two merchant ships, totaling 14,000 tons, and damaging several others. The enemy convoy managed to escape after five days of pursuit. The commanders of all the submarines participating in this attack were young and inexperienced, making this achievement all the more commendable.</p>

<h3 id="e21">Soviet Troops Concentrate Main Forces to Defend Stalingrad; Caucasus Front Employs Scorched Earth Tactics; German Forces Increase Pressure Toward Black Sea Coast <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 11th (Allied News Agency) – According to British sources, the fate of the Caucasus-Timoshenko forces will be decided within days. The focus of the battle has now concentrated on Stalingrad. According to neutral observers, General Timoshenko has decided to abandon the defense of the Caucasus and concentrate his main forces in Stalingrad to stop the German advance on the Volga River. Reuters, Moscow, reports that German forces have made astonishing progress in the past 48 hours, and the war in the North Caucasus is nearing its end. As they retreat, Soviet troops will adopt a scorched earth policy, blowing up roads and bridges, and destroying power plants.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 11th (Allied News Agency) – After German mechanized units occupied Armavir, a key point in the Kuban region of the North Caucasus, they advanced south. It is reported that they have already penetrated Cherkessk, located 100 kilometers south of Armavir. According to the Soviet Information Bureau's announcement on the 11th, German and Soviet forces are currently engaged in fierce fighting in the area.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Haitong News Agency) – According to the latest news received by Haitong News Agency, the characteristic of the Eastern Front yesterday was the increased German pressure on the areas along the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea, and the threat to Stalingrad. Soviet troops are now crowded in a narrow area between Kerch and Tuapse, with no escape from German aircraft attacks. Soviet troops in Novorossiysk have boarded ships and are withdrawing by sea. Eleven Soviet transport ships have been sunk and nine damaged by German aircraft. Therefore, the Soviets do not have enough ships to withdraw. The number of Soviet troops in the area is currently unknown. Reports of German troops crossing the Kerch Strait and German paratroopers attacking Novorossiysk have not been confirmed. Soviet troops in Stalingrad are currently putting up fierce resistance. General Timoshenko's troops are now concentrated there, and new reinforcements have been transferred to the city. The Germans believe that once the encircled Soviet troops in the Kalach district are annihilated, the German forces in that area can be transferred to put pressure on Stalingrad. There has been no news of a German attack on Pyatigorsk. It is generally believed that the Germans' second target is the Grozny oil field, the third most important oil field in the Caucasus, producing 2.6 million tons annually, and only 150 kilometers from the port of Gala on the Caspian Sea.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Allied News Agency) – Military authorities announced today that German tanks and air force are putting pressure on the Red Army in the Sea of Azov, while Romanian troops have captured Slaviansk-na-Kubani, located 40 miles northwest of Krasnodar. Romanian forces captured Yeysk on Monday.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 11th (Havas News Agency) – According to the latest news from the front lines, the positions of the warring parties are roughly as follows: A large number of German troops have landed in the northern part of the Taman Peninsula and are continuing to advance. Another German force advancing along the lower reaches of the Kuban River has reached Troitsskaya. Sevryukayeva, west of Mariupol, has also been occupied by German forces. After crossing the Kalaus River, German-Romanian forces are currently advancing toward Blagodarnoye. Between the Sal River and the Don River, advance units of German troops have reached several points on the west bank of the Volga River. However, this news has not been confirmed. In the Don River delta, both sides are trying to seize strategically important points near Stalingrad, so fierce fighting has erupted and continues to this day. In the Kalach area, the Red Army is still resisting, but its main positions seem to have shifted. The Red Army is apparently being forced to retreat. German-Romanian forces are still employing a large-scale encirclement strategy, and five divisions of the Red Army are in danger of being encircled. Therefore, at present, the only option is to retreat quickly. The development of the battle in this area will have a decisive impact on the battle for Stalingrad. According to an observer, the fate of this important town has already been sealed and will be known by the end of this week. In the Rzhev area, the Red Army has launched a counteroffensive for twelve days. Today, the Red Army continued its fierce counteroffensive. The Germans also admit that the Red Army has opened a gap in the German lines. Fierce fighting is still ongoing, and the intensity of the fighting is increasing. However, this matter is not very important, because the Germans are still employing "blitzkrieg" tactics to rapidly advance in the Caucasus, attempting to occupy the ports along the Black Sea coast. Another German force, which departed from Voroshilovsk a week ago, has crossed the Kuban River and is only 90 miles away from the port of Novorossiysk. The Red Army will withdraw by sea from this port, so the port is being bombed day and night by German aircraft and has become a great hell. It is said that the casualties among the Soviet troops are very heavy. In the Mariupol area, the equipment of the oil refineries has been completely destroyed by the Red Army on its own initiative. German engineer units are now trying to restore the oil refineries and are very busy. German troops are currently climbing the mountains in the Caucasus region. As for the German troops who occupied Armavir, they have been divided into two groups. The first group has reached Mozdok, and the other group is advancing toward Ordzhonikidze and will occupy it within the next day or two. In short, another goal of the German advance in the Caucasus is to occupy the Grozny oil region. According to German claims, it is expected that the Red Army will not put up a determined resistance in the area. By the end of this week, German soldiers will reach the port of Tuapse, so they can bathe on the Black Sea coast.</p>
<p>Violent Battles in the Don River Bend</p>
<p>Soviet Counteroffensive in Rzhev</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 12th (Havas News Agency) – The great battle within the Don River bend west of the Kalach hills will soon come to an end. Once the remaining enemy forces within the Don River bend are cleared, the German forces will directly advance on Stalingrad. However, the Soviet side says that General Timoshenko, Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Front, is already confident in defending Stalingrad and has resolved to defend it to the death at any cost. At the same time, the fighting is also very fierce in the Rzhev area northwest of Moscow. Even the German authorities admit that the Red Army's "offensive in that area is very powerful." Other military observers also say that "this battle should not be taken lightly." As for the Caucasus region, after the Germans captured Krasnodar and Maikop, the terrain has become difficult and the progress has slowed down somewhat.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 11th (Allied News Agency) – According to news from London, the main force of the German offensive has reached the east bank of the Don River bend south of Kletskaya. At the same time as the German forces are attacking fiercely, there are also rumors that German paratroopers have landed behind Soviet lines. At the same time, a large group of German troops northeast of Kotelnikovo are making every effort to move north along the railway to Stalingrad. According to another report, a part of the German troops has broken through the Soviet defenses and opened a route of attack. Kotelnikovo is about 80 kilometers from Kletskaya. If the Germans connect the south of the Kletskaya front line with the northeast of the Kotelnikovo front line, then the German attack will cause the Soviet troops on the Stalingrad front to face the greatest crisis. The Soviet Union has also admitted this. According to a report from the front-line correspondent of Izvestia, the situation behind Stalingrad has become very serious, and its danger is constantly increasing. Furthermore, the Soviet newspaper Pravda reported on the 11th that the fighting in the Kotelnikovo area is still continuing. Soviet troops are constantly resisting, and Soviet and German forces are engaged in fierce fighting with cross-fire. The situation is extremely intense.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Havas News Agency) – The German High Command announced in a special war report this morning that most of the Soviet 62nd Army and most of the 1st Tank Army have been annihilated by our land and air forces within the Don River bend west of Kalach. 57,000 people were captured, along with over 1,000 tanks and 750 field guns. Since the German forces launched a spring offensive in the Kerch Peninsula, up to this battle in the Don River bend, German forces and their allies have captured 1,044,741 Soviet officers and soldiers, seized 6,271 tanks, 10,131 various field guns, and shot down 4,960 aircraft. In addition, 664 were shot down by anti-aircraft guns, and 432 were destroyed at airfields.</p>
<p>One of the Three Major Oil Regions of the Caucasus</p>
<p>Falls into German Hands</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 11th (Havas News Agency) – According to the "Journal de Genève," after the fall of Maikop, one of the three major oil regions of the Caucasus has fallen into German hands. Not only that, but there are other oil fields north of the city, such as near Krasnodar, where a small number of oil fields have already been developed. In particular, the oil wells in Kaluzhskaya (30 miles north of Krasnodar), Adygeyskaya (between Krasnodar and the Black Sea), and Krymskaya (near Novorossiysk) are the largest in scale. The Maikop oil fields were discovered on the eve of World War I and had prospects for development, but the Russian Revolution disrupted domestic order and greatly reduced production. However, in 1929, a new oil field was discovered near Apsheronskaya (southwest of Maikop, not on the Apsheron Peninsula), and its reserves are among the largest in the world. Some of these oil wells can produce around 800 tons of oil per day. As a result, Maikop oil production increased greatly, from only 157,000 tons in 1929 to 766,000 tons in 1933, and further to 2,250,000 tons in 1938. Today, its production is probably around 3 million tons, and its reserves are at least 50 million tons. As for transportation, Maikop has a railway passing through Krasnodar, and there is an oil pipeline that can send crude oil to refineries in the city for refining. In addition, there is also a railway that leads to the Black Sea port of Sochi, which is very convenient. The oil pipeline from Baku to Rostov also passes through here, so the situation is becoming increasingly important. The Soviet Union may have implemented a scorched earth policy, destroying the oil wells. If so, it will take the Germans several months to restore production.</p>

<h3 id="e27">German Forces Intercept Secret Soviet Military Order; Berlin Discloses Its Contents <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Haitong News Agency) – The German army, during its pursuit of retreating enemy forces between the Don and the Caucasus, raided the Soviet General Staff in the area and seized a secret military order issued by Stalin prohibiting retreat. The order was issued on July 28 and was stamped with "Secret Military Order No. 227 issued by the People's Commissariat for Defense of the Soviet Union, July 28, 1942." It was signed by "Stalin, People's Commissar for Defense of the Soviet Union." Its contents stated that the Red Army's repeated retreats to the east have disappointed the people of the whole country, and some have even criticized them. The Red Army has almost lost the hearts of the people. Our country's resources are not unlimited. Since losing Ukraine, Belarus, the Baltic States, the Donets Basin, and other territories, the national border has been shrinking, which means a reduction in import factory resources. From now on, our manpower and material resources can no longer be superior to Germany. If we continue to retreat, it will be tantamount to announcing our collapse. If we do not hold our ground and fight, then our bread, fuel, metal resources, railways, and factories will all be lost. Our country has now entered the most difficult period. Order and military discipline have disappeared. Therefore, it is necessary to annihilate the defeatists. German military discipline is extremely strict. Now, in order to rectify military discipline, the General Staff of the Red Army has issued the following military orders: Military councils, especially commanders of the front lines, are responsible for eliminating the defeatist atmosphere in the army and preventing propaganda that is unrelated to the battle and promotes withdrawal to the east. Any army commanders who allow soldiers to leave their positions without special orders will be severely punished according to military law. Units that retreat in battle will have their officers and political commissars organized into special service battalions and sent to the most dangerous areas to fight. Army commanders, division commanders, or political commissars who allow their soldiers to retreat without authorization will be dismissed and severely punished according to military law. Reliable troops will be stationed behind each army battlefield to execute fleeing soldiers who retreat from the front and organize reliable special service battalions to be sent to dangerous areas for emergency response. Battalion commanders or regimental commanders and their political commissars who allow their soldiers to retreat without authorization will also be dismissed and punished according to military law.</p>

<p>To us today, this seems an incredible thing, why an empire as well-equipped with weapons as Russia should be so wearied by suppressing a handful of primitive peoples. Modern blitzkrieg tactics might crush their resistance in an instant. However, we must know that in those days, the fortified villages on the peaks of Dagestan could not be reduced by heavy artillery bombardment or aerial bombing, and the natives living in the forests were so adept at using their lairs in the vast and sparsely populated forests that it was simply impossible to engage them. The Russian army fought as if against phantom enemies, constantly disappearing from their sight, yet threatening their lines of communication with surprise attacks at every moment of Russian unpreparedness, resulting in demoralization, and every possible victory often turning into a rout. Only when the natives left the protection of their ancestral forests did the Russian army occasionally find itself in an advantageous position.</p>
<p>The natives fought to the death. They were motivated not only to defend their long-held freedom but also by religious fanaticism. It should also be noted that the advocacy by a few Russian generals of a policy of terror to exterminate the natives only intensified this fanaticism. According to some historians, had the Russian General Yermolov not used the pretext of native cruelty to implement extremely cruel policies, the militant religious movement called Murldism might never have occurred, and its leaders would not have wearied Russia until the 1850s.</p>
<p>The harsh policies adopted by Russia towards its new protectorates also caused great dissatisfaction, eventually leading to rebellions in various Georgian states. However, Russia faced an extremely difficult task, as the geography of the region, suitable for division into small states and tribal territories, had become commonplace. Therefore, Russia was ultimately able to complete the unification of Georgia. Developing transportation and introducing modern living skills must be recognized as a great achievement. If left to their own devices, the anarchic, extravagant, and artistically gifted Georgians would never have achieved this progress.</p>
<p>The Georgian atmosphere—a love of gorgeous clothing, frenzied dancing, and boisterous feasts celebrating ancient folk songs—moved countless travelers of the past, including the author of one of the oldest travelogues about the Caucasus, published eighty years ago. He amusingly described how he was once embarrassed by the incessant toasts of the Georgians, resulting in him becoming completely drunk.</p>
<p>The same book also describes visits to deep mountains and isolated valleys, where countless generations of tribes have lived (and still live) in complete isolation from the outside world, wearing chain mail onto the battlefield and carrying all sorts of bizarre ancient weapons.</p>
<p>Russian orders never had much effect among these natives, and their hostility towards Russia was very stubborn and tended towards extremes. The most serious incident occurred in 1812, the year when Russian power in the Caucasus faced its greatest threat. Popular rebellions broke out throughout Georgia, and soon all the mountain tribes united to resist the saviors who had been so welcomed a few years earlier. Fortunately, Russia concluded a peace treaty with Turkey at a critical moment; the campaign against the native base of Shatil in 1813 turned the tide; and by the time Yermolov arrived to take office as commander-in-chief in 1816, order had been completely restored.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, Yermolov was one of the most outstanding generals in Russia at the time. In the eyes of his countrymen, he always occupied the first position among the many generals who had been sent to the Caucasus; his popularity was not only because of his repeated victories on the battlefield but also because of his great care for his subordinates; at the same time, his eccentric personality and unique insights further elevated his status. The so-called unique insights included his open contempt for the German influence that prevailed at the Russian court at the time. He was fortunate to work with a chief of staff named Velyaminov, who was superior to Yermolov in terms of talent, education, and military knowledge, but Yermolov was undoubtedly a more admired figure.</p>
<p>Yermolov's greatest aim in his repeated expeditions was to quell native dissatisfaction and disloyalty so as to avoid Russian worries about its southern borders, which is certainly beyond reproach; but we cannot deny the many criticisms issued by General Paskevich, who succeeded him in 1826. He said that if Yermolov had shown greater ingenuity and compassion, his own work and that of his successors would have become much easier, and the suffering and hardships endured by the innocent could have been greatly reduced.</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Evacuation Committee has been handling evacuation work, it has achieved remarkable results. Previously, it cooperated with China Central Railway Company and East Asia Shipping Co., Ltd., and all citizens returning to their hometowns enjoyed a 50% discount on transportation. However, as the burden on the two companies was too heavy, the 50% discount on transportation has been discontinued. It is now learned that the evacuation committee believes that the evacuation of the population in the city should not be stopped, and at the same time, there are many people who cannot afford to return to their hometowns. With the consent of the Shanghai Branch of the Relief Committee, joint relief work has been organized. All impoverished citizens returning to their hometowns who genuinely need subsidies for travel expenses can apply to the committee at Office No. 277 of the Shanghai Municipal Council. After the committee approves the application, it will issue relief tickets, which can be used to collect travel expenses at the Shanghai Branch of the Relief Committee. It is also heard that various hometown associations can also introduce impoverished citizens to the evacuation committee to apply, so as to make it more widespread. It is expected that the evacuation work will be easier to promote in the future, which is often related to the city's food, security, and other aspects.</p>

<p>Today is the anniversary of the "August 13th" Shanghai Battle. The police authorities of the two concessions, fearing that petty criminals would take the opportunity to engage in activities and disrupt public order, have decided to send a large number of Chinese and foreign police officers and reserve teams to various districts within the concessions to patrol, search pedestrians and vehicles, and completely block off all unimportant road intersections on the four borders. The intersections on both sides of Avenue Edward VII (today's Yan'an East Road) and Avenue Foch (today's Yan'an Middle Road) that connect the Public Concession and the French Concession, except for traffic arteries that must be passed by trams or buses, are also completely blocked, and police officers are strengthened to defend them. On the other hand, public gatherings are also prohibited to ensure security. Members of the self-defense corps in the Public Concession received an order from the Baojia Guidance Department yesterday, requiring them to pay special attention and be on strict alert today. In addition, the Japanese naval landing force or local police officers in various districts such as Hongkou, Zhabei, Nanshi, and West Shanghai are taking special precautions. Except for citizens who must go out for work, it is best for citizens to stay indoors today. The special precautionary measures can be completely lifted starting tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Yokoyama's Report</p>
<p>Speech by the Minister, Allied Press Dispatch from this port: Yokoyama, the Minister of Reporting, recently gave a speech commemorating the fifth anniversary of the August 13th Incident, stating that the Sino-Japanese War broke out in Shanghai because of the anti-Japanese ideology of the Communists and the anti-Japanese education led by the United Kingdom and the United States for more than 20 years. The murder of Captain Oyama at Hongqiao Airport was not the only reason. Now, the United Kingdom and the United States have cast themselves into the net, inviting the enemy into the trap. We should commemorate Captain Oyama and other heroes who sacrificed their lives to restore East Asia. Their last thought at the time of their death was "Long live the Emperor of Japan." The Emperor of Japan's only hope is for peace in East Asia. We must respect the Japanese soldiers who died in the war. Based on the principle of coexistence and co-prosperity, Shanghai should become the cradle of the Eastern spiritual revival movement to establish a new world order. The light emanating from the East will make the whole world shine to commemorate the fallen Japanese soldiers. This is our responsibility.</p>
<p>Colonel Kamata</p>
<p>Delivers a Speech, according to the Allied Press: Colonel Kamata, the Reporting Minister of the Japanese Fleet, delivered a speech for the "August 13th" Commemoration, stating that July 7th was the first anniversary of the outbreak of the Great East Asia War after the China Incident. Today, August 13th, marks the fifth anniversary of the outbreak of the Shanghai Battle. There are infinite emotions. When the incident broke out, we adhered to the policy of non-expansion and tried our best to resolve the issue on the spot. However, the Lushan Conference suddenly issued a statement rejecting our promise to resolve the issue on the spot, and the situation took a turn for the worse. On August 9th, Lieutenant Oyama of the Shanghai Special Naval Landing Force and Private Saito were surrounded and killed by the security team while passing through Beifang Road, resulting in the so-called Oyama Incident. On August 11th, armed security teams were active in the concession, and the crisis was on the verge of war. Our naval landing force was also assigned to the concession on the 12th to maintain order in the business district. However, the waterway security team deliberately sank steamships and merchant ships in the Huangpu River, blocking the waterway and cutting off our submarine cables, cutting off communication. As a result, Shanghai, which was in a dangerous situation, was attacked at 9:00 am on August 13th, Showa 12 (1937), by plainclothes troops firing machine guns at our side from the direction of the Commercial Press near the Xiaohongbang intersection in Hongkou. Chinese reconnaissance planes also flew over the naval landing force headquarters to scout. At this point, our special naval landing force, which had been enduring and respecting the imperial policy, launched an attack on Zhabei at 3:00 pm. The naval landing force headquarters had no choice but to fight back, officially launching the first Shanghai Incident. Although I do not intend to repeat the war results of the Japanese army at that time, I believe that Shanghai is a watershed in the war situation of the China Incident. The Japanese naval landing force fought resolutely and was able to promote the mighty spirit of our imperial navy at home and abroad. If our naval landing force had failed before the arrival of the army reinforcement units, what would have been the result for our rights and interests along the Yangtze River from Shanghai? Every time I think about this, I dare not forget the loyal and heroic results achieved by the Japanese soldiers who worked together to overcome difficulties. However, the Shanghai Incident was also a major rehearsal for the Great East Asia War. To put it simply, today, the great war results achieved by the Japanese army from the west coast of the United States in the east, to the Aleutian Islands in the north, to Australia in the south, and to Madagascar in the west, are not only due to the excellence of weapons and the superiority of tactics. This is also because after the China Incident, the hostility displayed by the United Kingdom and the United States was imprinted in our minds, and in order to crush this extremely unreasonable "Washington system," it was the result of the national people passing on the hard training without any mistakes. Since the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, we have repeatedly stated that the China Incident is a part of the Great East Asia War. The reason for this is that the purpose and cause of this war are solely to defeat the United Kingdom and the United States. The background of the China Incident has been revealed to be our direct enemy. However, the final victory of the Great East Asia War must be achieved this year by unleashing and completing the firm beliefs and strength gained from the China Incident over the past five years. For this reason, today we must vow to move forward on the road to building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere to the loyal souls who sacrificed themselves for the Shanghai Incident at that time.</p>

The Japanese authorities issued a notice regarding this matter yesterday morning, citing a section of the blackout regulations promulgated last week, stating that "All outdoor lights will be covered and preparations will be made to implement a preliminary blackout at any time." It is heard that the main motive for these air defense exercises is to prepare for possible air raids. At the beginning and end of each exercise, special sirens installed at eleven locations in the city will sound an alarm. The Shanghai Municipal Council also issued a notice stating that from yesterday until otherwise announced, all lights used for advertising signs and decorations in the Public Concession should be turned off and closed.</p>

<p>According to medical professionals, a new type of high fever and chills has been discovered in recent days. The patient's fever is so high that the thermometer can explode when placed in the mouth. In most cases, the temperature is measured in the armpit. The patients have no prior symptoms, so many cannot be saved. Generally, the illness is due to uneven cold and heat exposure and irregular diet and living habits. The crowded funerals in the funeral homes these days are particularly shocking.</p>
<p>Registration of Hidden Poverty More Than</p>
<p>Doubled</p>
<p>The Second Phase of Hidden Poverty Registration organized by the Sanjiao Moral Welfare Council has been completed. The number of registered hidden poverty households this time is more than double that of the first phase, reaching more than 1,400 households, and 19% are intellectuals. All sectors of society have expressed deep sympathy and willingness to assist in the council's work to help the hidden poor. For example, the French Commercial Charity Lottery Welfare Association donated 500 French francs to be used for relief of the hidden poor. However, the council still relies on its inherent ability to raise funds for the distribution of supplies to the hidden poor and will not solicit donations from outside for the time being. However, the expenses are huge, and in order to ensure sustainability, it is hoped that kind people from all walks of life will generously assist.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Second Emergency Epidemic Hospital Is Extremely Busy with Defense, Number of Outpatients Exceeds 1,000 Daily, Providing Health Guidance to the Poor and Sick <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Due to the hot weather and the prevalence of cholera, the Shanghai New Medicine and Pharmaceutical Trade Association, in view of the particularly crowded population in Shanghai this year, which makes it easy to spread the disease, organized the Second Emergency Epidemic Hospital on Great Western Road. The hospital has been busy with diagnosis and treatment in recent days, and its perfect operation has been praised by all sectors of society. The latest situation of the hospital is as follows:</p>
<p>Organization</p>
<p>Funding The hospital is run by the Shanghai New Medicine and Pharmaceutical Trade Association, and Mr. Xu Xiaochu was elected as the chairman of the board of directors. The organization is divided into three departments: medical affairs, administration, and accounting. Nine physicians who graduated from famous domestic and foreign medical universities and more than 30 nurses and clerks were hired, all with rich experience and serious work attitude. The original monthly budget for the hospital's operating expenses was 20,000 yuan. However, due to the large number of true cholera cases and the surge in outpatients, the consumption of medicines has been huge. In addition, the staff has to work in two shifts, day and night, so it is necessary to hire additional doctors and nurses. According to current statistics, the minimum monthly expenditure is about 50,000 yuan. The source of funds is borne by the board of directors, and there are also many automatic donations from all walks of life.</p>
<p>Purpose of Establishment</p>
<p>The main purpose of the establishment of the hospital is to help the poor and sick and provide emergency treatment for epidemics. All outpatient, inpatient, medical, food, injection, and registration items are free of charge. Emergency cases are treated immediately upon arrival, and services are provided day and night. The wards are not graded, and all patients are treated equally. No introduction is required, which is convenient for the poor and sick, and is especially praised by all sectors of society. In terms of medication, no matter how expensive the medicine is, as long as it is prescribed by a doctor, it will be purchased immediately, with the aim of saving people thoroughly.</p>
<p>Service</p>
<p>Spirit The weather has been bad these days, and there are especially many poor and sick people. The number of outpatients in the hospital exceeds 1,000 every day. The doctors and nurses are extremely tired in spirit and work even when they are sick. Their hard work is admirable. In order to prevent the spread of cholera, the hospital assists the authorities in administering vaccinations. About 1,000 people go to the hospital for vaccination every day. It also responds to the applications of various organizations and goes out to administer vaccinations. More than 50 organizations have been vaccinated, with a total of more than 20,000 people. Two public health nurses are also dispatched to the patients' homes to provide technical guidance on environmental hygiene and give lectures on public health and cholera prevention methods, so that the poor and sick can have basic prevention knowledge and achieve remarkable results.</p>
<p>Response from All Sectors</p>
<p>The hospital has a large number of outpatients and a huge amount of drug expenses. As a hospital serving the public, it is impossible for one person or one industry to bear this huge task. In recent days, various associations, such as the Shanghai Yarn Trade Association and the Chinese and Foreign Department Store Trade Association, have raised huge sums of money and sent them to the hospital. Other organizations, businesses, and individuals have also enthusiastically responded and donated. If readers have donations, please send them directly to the hospital. Address: 47A Great Western Road, Telephone: 22395.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Impoverished University Students Allowed to Continue Applying for the Newspaper's Scholarship, Committee Decides Applications Start Immediately, Deadline is the 20th <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The Shenbao Newspaper's Third Scholarship Committee held a meeting at the newspaper office at 5:00 PM yesterday. Committee members Shen Siliang, Chen Qingshi, Lu Gaoyi, Yang Nielingyu (Ding Guangdiao's representative) and Zhao Zongyuyi attended. Ding Guangxun and Ms. Xu Xuehai from the Youth Association's Impoverished Student Relief Association, as well as the newspaper's scholarship staff, were present. First, the newspaper's representative expressed sincere gratitude to the committee members for their past instructions on the scholarship policy and to the Youth Association for hosting the screening exams for the primary and secondary school groups. Secondly, the report thanked the community for the satisfactory results of this year's scholarship donations. The report also covered the examination process, the proportion of applicants and approved numbers for each group (elementary, middle, high school, industry, commerce), and the budget for allocating scholarships to each group. Then, there was a discussion on several important matters, summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>Key Issues:</p>
<p>* The committee members reviewed the exam papers and examined the list of approved scholarship recipients for primary and secondary schools.</p>
<p>* Students who failed the exam were re-selected, and those with passing grades were selected.</p>
<p>* At the beginning of the next application process, the school authorities should be asked to recommend students with excellent grades and truly impoverished families. However, the final decision will still be made by this newspaper.</p>
<p>* Recently, this newspaper received letters from impoverished university students requesting special accommodations to allow them to submit their applications to avoid dropping out of school. After serious discussion, the committee members believe that the students' pleas are sincere, and some are graduating from university. Once assisted, they will be able to serve society. The association should do its best to help. It was approved to extend the application period for one week from today, until the 20th of this month. All impoverished university students can quickly obtain application forms from this office and fill them out according to the procedures. However, they must have written proof from the school authorities that they are truly impoverished, studious, and of good character to be eligible. Primary, secondary, and vocational students are not allowed to request the same treatment.</p>
<p>* Before the next scholarship program, the diligence and actual academic performance of the past scholarship recipients should be investigated to facilitate assessment and supervision. The specific methods will be determined separately. Other matters were omitted.</p>
<p>Donations Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, we received generous donations from all walks of life for the scholarship fund. The list of donors is as follows: Chun He Yong Silk and Wool Shop, Hong Fuyuan, 500 yuan; Anonymous (receipt number 1542), 406 yuan; Song Yuanyuan, 160 yuan; Shareholders of Shende Qianzhuang, 150 yuan; Mr. Ding Fubao's birthday gifts transferred to the scholarship fund, a total of 500 yuan (Cheng Zhiliang, 100 yuan; Zhou Yongyu, 50 yuan; Jiang Shihua, 50 yuan; Wang Jiarong, 50 yuan; Liu Zhifang, 50 yuan; Zhou Shuilin, 50 yuan; Chuan Jintang, 50 yuan; Fan Ruihua, 50 yuan; Zhu Zhuoxian, 50 yuan); Qiu Fenglin, 40 yuan; Tong Ji, 30 yuan; Luo Yicun, Luo Yilin, 1 yuan; Luo Huaiyi, Luo Huaijin, 1 yuan.

<h3 id="e48">Gypsies in Shanghai During Wartime: Musical Geniuses Amidst a Complex Class System <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai is an international metropolis where people from all over the world can be seen, representing dozens of nationalities. Some come to Shanghai for business, but many more wander into this open port of trade with arbitrary entry. Of these wandering foreigners, Russians seem to be the most numerous. Driven out by Red Russia, they drifted here and have settled down, though they long to return to their homeland to the north, but cannot. Next are the Jews, who have recently been expelled from Europe and have flocked to Shanghai in large numbers. Their money-making skills are the most refined, leaving an even stronger impression than the Russians. But there is also another kind of wandering people who have come to Shanghai, living peacefully and minding their own business, living in a "romantic" atmosphere. They have no consular protection, nor do they have any general assembly or association to represent their interests. These are the Gypsies.</p>
<p>Mention of Gypsies brings to mind the image of these wandering people dressed in colorful clothes, singing and dancing. There are about 400 Gypsies in Shanghai, most of whom live in the cheaper housing around Rue du Père Robert in the French Concession. Here, one can often see women with bright red and emerald green skirts, dark, bright eyes, and dark skin, who are easily recognized as Gypsies. Every night, as you pass the intersection of Avenue Notre Dame and Avenue Joffre, Gypsy women often stop you, asking you to extend your palm to read your palm lines, for a fee of just one yuan. Gypsy women practice this trade all over the world, it seems, and are quite famous for it. However, they are only using a few hackneyed phrases to give customers a bit of empty satisfaction. They might say that one day you will become a big boss of a bank, or the lover of a famous actress; otherwise, they will say that you will have many children and grandchildren, and your old age will be blessed. Some Gypsy women even call themselves "fortune tellers," renting houses and doing business, with small signs hanging on the door, reading: "Welcome customers from 4 to 8 PM every day." It is said that some Western women in Shanghai's upper class believe in the "predictions" of Gypsy women and often go to ask for advice, of course for a higher fee, about 20 yuan each time.</p>
<p>Although Gypsies are wandering people with a leisurely life, they cannot help but worry about the cost of bread, tea, wine, clothing, and housing in Shanghai, where the cost of living is extremely high. Perhaps Gypsies are born with musical talent, so there are many Gypsy dancers, singers, and musicians in Shanghai who are active in nightclubs and are very popular. Like the Jews, who are also stateless wandering people, the Jews live by their business skills everywhere, calculating every penny. Gypsies, however, only carry a mandolin, wandering the world, never leaving its side. As long as they have money in their pockets, they try to find pleasure as much as possible, willing to empty their pockets before figuring out what to do next.</p>
<p>The Gypsies in Shanghai used to have their own nightclub, which was exciting and lively, and the best in Shanghai. The business was naturally very prosperous, but the few Gypsy directors did not know how to accumulate wealth, and eventually could not maintain it. However, nightclubs that employ Gypsies to perform can still attract many customers.</p>
<p>Gypsy girls have another kind of charming magic. If you know her and even take her to the cinema or other places for entertainment, then her father will definitely follow you and issue a serious warning, even resorting to violence, dragging her into the house. This is because they never allow marriage to outsiders, so the bloodline of the Gypsies is considered the purest. However, most of the Gypsies in Shanghai belong to three major tribes, and mysterious tribal feuds often occur. French Concession police officers often find two drunk Gypsies fighting fiercely in dark corners. When questioned, there is no reason, just tribal discord. The police, of course, reprimand such petty quarrels. However, one of the two Gypsies must have already suffered a loss, so he cries out to his tribe for revenge, even ambushing members of the other tribe with weapons. Therefore, tribal feuds are endless. As for young men and women, of course, they only consider marriage with friendly tribes. Since Gypsies have a romantic nature, stories of love like "Romeo and Juliet" are especially popular among young men and women.</p>
<p>Although the Gypsies in Shanghai are very few, their internal structure is extremely complex. In addition to tribal disputes, there are also deep class divisions. Originally, Gypsies have three hereditary social classes, each engaged in its own profession and not interacting with other professions. These are musicians, bear-keepers, and tinkers. Some Gypsies' ancestors have long since stopped engaging in these occupations, but their descendants still inherit these social class distinctions and cannot escape them. Some Gypsies consider their social status to be higher than others, inevitably revealing an arrogant demeanor. Especially in Shanghai, there is also a fourth kind of Gypsy, coming directly from India, most of whom are impoverished and live in dilapidated houses north of Suzhou Creek, eking out a living. Other Gypsies are ashamed to associate with them and refuse to speak to them.</p>
<p>Most Gypsies wander to the East from Hungary, Romania, or southern Russia. Along the way, various countries strictly inspect passports, but Gypsies have no passports at all, yet they manage to slip through. They first arrived in Harbin, where they were able to make a living due to the prosperity of the nightclubs. But Gypsies are used to wandering from a young age and cannot stay in one place for long, so they traveled south along the coast, passing through Qingdao and Tianjin, and finally arriving in Shanghai. Some even set out from Shanghai to wander inland, as far as Hankou, but soon returned to Shanghai. Perhaps this is their idea of paradise on earth.</p>
<p>There are about 400,000 Gypsies scattered throughout Europe. Their ancestors were originally slaves. After being released by the Tatars around the Middle Ages, they migrated to Europe from India or Central Asia. Some historians believe that the earliest settlement of Gypsies was Egypt, and soon they spread throughout Europe. Today, they can be found in Spain, Denmark, the United States, and South America. Because they make their homes everywhere, they are fluent in the local dialects. For example, the Gypsies in Shanghai can speak Russian, English, French, Hungarian, and Romanian, and even Chinese, German, Italian, and even Indian languages.</p>
<p>Gypsies are usually indifferent to politics, only concerned about the election of the Gypsy king and the annual Gypsy Congress held in Camargue. The current ruler of the Gypsies is Michel II, who was elected five years ago on a plain in Poland. He has no country, no palace, and no crown, but he wanders the roads of Europe. His loyal ministers "escort" him, following Michel II everywhere. All major decisions are made at the annual meeting of European Gypsies in Camargue. Camargue is on the plain at the mouth of the Rhone River in Switzerland. According to Gypsy tradition, after the crucifixion of Jesus, the three women, including the Virgin Mary, landed here. One of the black-skinned women was the ancestor of the Gypsies, so they gather here every year to sing, dance, and revel in memory. In recent years, Europe has been ravaged by war and transportation has been blocked, so the Gypsy Congress in Camargue has not been held.</p>

<p>Liu Mingxing, from Wujin, has been running the Mingxing Bookstore inside the Minguang Middle School at No. 2, Lane 11, Jiaozhou Road for many years. He hired Zhou Mingzhi (28 years old) from Yangzhou as an employee. At the end of last year, Liu dismissed Zhou, and Zhou opened another bookstore in the school. On the night of January 15th of this year, Zhou suddenly sneaked into Liu's place and saw Liu's daughter, Jianhua (17 years old), fast asleep and unaware, with no one else nearby. Lust arose in him, and he forcibly defiled the girl. Afterwards, he even offered to marry the girl and told her not to make it public. The girl was young and forced, so she obeyed. Later, Zhou went to the girl's place twice, on January 21st and February 24th, to continue his pleasure. By this time, the girl had learned that everything Zhou had said was a lie. Not only was he already married with two children, but he also rejected her. Unexpectedly, Zhou's lust did not die, and he sent five love letters in a row to seduce the girl. The night before last, he went again to force himself on her, and the girl shouted loudly. Her mother, Liu Yao, arrested him and took Zhou to the police station. After investigation by Detective Xia Yeshan, it was confirmed that the facts were true, and he was ordered to be detained. He was interrogated yesterday morning. The girl hired lawyer Pan Zhensheng to file a civil suit for 5,000 yuan. The court adjourned the hearing for further verification, and the defendant was sent back into custody.</p>

<p>Yesterday's government bond market was initially flat. Prices had been slightly higher for several days, showing a good trend. However, at the beginning of the session, bullish sentiment was slightly hesitant, and the market gradually showed small declines. Then, a large amount of floating capital came out, but sentiment remained good, and the price decline was small. In the end, Hongda, Shuntai, Xinfeng, Hengyu, and Hengtai absorbed the selling, while Shunde, Hongxing, Jiufeng, Shunli, Runheng, Xinhua, Yuanhe, Hu Heji, Lianyi, etc., sold off slightly. The final transaction volume was around 1.78 million yuan. The details are listed below:</p>
<h3 id="e54">Chinese Stocks Fluctuate <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Chinese Stock Association Ready to Be Established</p>
<p>The Chinese stock market was mixed, with the overall trend slightly softening. Popular stocks such as China Underwear and New Asia Pharmaceutical both experienced significant declines, with the former falling two yuan and the latter falling two yuan and twenty-five cents. Sino-French Bank fell below 80 yuan, down one yuan and a half. Yong'an and Xinxin companies were stable. Culture stocks, the Commercial Press, recovered by five yuan. Zhonghua and Shijie Bookstores continued to advance, rising two yuan and a half to one yuan and five cents. Da Zhonghua Matches recovered by five yuan, with buyers absorbing the stock. Zhabei Water and Electricity and China Leiqi each fell by half a yuan. Hanyeping also fell slightly. Dasheng No. 1 Factory was supported by buyers, rising five yuan, while No. 3 Factory was suppressed by four yuan. Yongxiang Printing Company and others were stable. Sentiment from all parties turned uncertain. Trading was quite active. The stock market price list is recorded below:</p>
<p>It is heard that the World Bookstore Co., Ltd. shares, with a face value of 50 yuan in old currency per share, will be converted to 25 yuan in new currency. However, because the company has accumulated surpluses over the years, a large sum will be allocated from the public reserve, and 25 yuan in new currency will be added to each share, matching the face value of 50 yuan in new currency. It is also heard that the bureau has decided to hold a shareholders' meeting this month to expand its capital, with every two old shares eligible for one new share.</p>
<p>The flower stock business in this city has recently become a destination for floating capital. Newly established stock companies are springing up like mushrooms after rain. In order to prevent speculators from taking advantage, industry leaders have organized the Chinese Stock Association. It is now heard that preparations are complete and the association will be established after approval from the authorities. As for the rumors of a stock exchange, it is unlikely to materialize recently.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Letter <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor, In the local news section of your newspaper on the 8th of this month, the article "The Mystery of Citizen Certificates" contains many inaccuracies. The resident identity card office in the French Concession only began operations at the beginning of last month. How could there be a situation where cards have not been issued for several months? The accusations of obstruction and extortion are even further from the truth. The French Concession authorities and the Central Baojia Preparatory Committee have repeatedly declared that any instances of obstruction in any Baojia procedures should be reported immediately and will be severely punished. Furthermore, in order to avoid crowding due to the extreme heat, the French authorities issue the cards daily by bao and jia. Therefore, this letter is sent to request a correction. Sincerely, Commissioner Shi, Central Baojia Preparatory Committee of the French Concession, August 12th.</p>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper's reporting time was 6:30 PM.</p>

<p>Inter-Trade Prices Rise Sharply</p>
<p>Yesterday, the initial asking price for jewelry gold at Daxin and Tongxing jewelry stores in this city was 2,150 yuan per tael. Around 11 o'clock, the price was raised by 50 yuan to 2,200 yuan. The purchase price was reduced by 350 yuan. The cash stores raised prices early in the morning at about 10:00, hanging the price 100 yuan higher at 2,200 yuan, with the purchase price reduced by 200 yuan. The inter-trade price rose even more sharply, breaking through 1,900 yuan and still rising. In the early morning, the price was 1,890 yuan, up 10 yuan. A certain group rushed to buy, and a certain firm scrambled to bid, rising 70 yuan to 1,960 yuan at one point, the highest transaction price. A certain gold store sold independently, trying to reverse the rising trend, reducing the price by 20 yuan. The final price was 1,940 yuan, a further increase of 60 yuan compared to the previous day, with a difference of 70 yuan. Trading was not sparse. The inter-trade price of silver ornaments rose slightly to 11 yuan and 20 cents per tael.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Discount Rates and Military Tickets Unchanged <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the money industry association's discount rate was still 16 cents, and new drawings were settled with cash.</p>
<p>The Japanese military bonds have become sluggish. The inter-trade price remained at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, and 24 li. Banks and small money exchanges sold at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, and 6 fen and bought at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, and 4 fen and a half, the same as the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Soap, Candles, and Matches Calm <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The daily necessities market was calm, with inter-trade transactions being exceptionally quiet. Observing the market trend, it is difficult to make a breakthrough in a short period of time, much like the candle market, resulting in general users finding it difficult to buy soap. Solid brand soap remained at 295 yuan, Zixiangmao soap at 240 yuan, Huangxiangmao soap at 210 yuan, and Arrow Knife soap at 250 yuan. Matches continued to fall, with Phoenix Brand at 2,650 yuan, Beauty Brand at 2,800 yuan, Golden Tripod Brand at 2,500 yuan, and Miscellaneous Brands at 2,000 yuan. White Lees candles were 120 yuan, Monk Hat brand at 115 yuan, and miscellaneous brands at 10 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Lack of Buying at Low Prices; Cotton Cloth Recovers Well <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>East Cloth Yesterday, the cloth market recovered well again, with no shortage of buying. The closing price for new orders of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth was 178 yuan, and the bank order was 155 yuan and 5 jiao. Colored Ball fine cloth was 172 yuan, Flying Fish was 159 yuan, Four Gentlemen Serge was 7 yuan, 1 jiao, and 2 fen, and the bank order was 6 yuan and 4 jiao.</p>
<p>Factory Cloth The trade in coarse and fine cloth was quiet. Only Xinfu chicks and Shilin cloth traded well. The price was still 243 yuan. Peach Blossom Ladies Shilin also traded actively, with a price of 248 yuan and a half at the opening and the final transaction at 256 yuan and a half. 16-pound Earth coarse cloth was quoted at 173 yuan, and Flying Hong at 170 yuan, and 12-pound Earth fine cloth was quoted at 160 yuan, and Dapeng at 148 yuan, but there were few transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Yarn Factories Absorbing Large Mouth Iron <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the metal market still did not have a lively atmosphere. Except for large mouth iron, there were few transactions in other metal products. The reason for the consumption of 26-gauge large mouth iron was that the yarn factories in this street used it to make rollers. Since the day before yesterday, they had been searching for it diligently. In the end, the price was 120 yuan per sheet, and only about 40 sheets were purchased. The inventory of this type of large mouth iron in this city is only a few cases (each case contains 50 or 56 sheets). Therefore, the holders were unwilling to sell all of the only two or three cases of spot goods, so they held on to the price. They were only willing to sell a dozen or so sheets. However, on the one hand, the yarn factory needed the rollers urgently, so they suffered from the inability to buy the goods even with money, and on the other hand, there was a phenomenon of no goods available on the market. The thinness of the market goods and the good trend are evident.</p>
<p>The Woolen Fabric Market in the Hot Summer</p>
<p>Now, in the middle of the hot summer, the woolen fabric market has historically been in a sluggish state. This summer is especially so. Due to the special environment and the changes in current events, the market situation is very different. Retail sales are even lower, traders have stopped pre-purchasing, hoarders have disappeared, and customer sales are not rising. The prices, which have been rising all the way since 1927, are now falling one after another. Even with the decline, there are still few buyers, which shows that the woolen fabric business has turned from prosperity to decline.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Bean Cake Inventory Decreases <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The bean market had only sporadic transactions yesterday, and the market trend was rather quiet. Qingdao mung beans traded at 230 yuan for 20 bags, and Xiding white broad beans traded at 158 yuan for 15 bags.</p>
<p>The supply and demand of sweet potato chips were both half, and the price did not change. Jiangbei sweet potato chips traded at 105 yuan per bag.</p>
<p>Bean cake inventory decreased, but actual sales were also limited, so the market was stable. Yesterday, Shenji bean cake for February traded at 61 yuan for 500 pieces of Wangu Stock, and for April traded at 62 yuan for 1,000 pieces.</p>
<p>Yesterday, wheat bran was scarce and expensive. Sanxin small bag wheat bran for May traded at 98 yuan for 300 bags, an increase of 3 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Dried Scallops Rise <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Recently, both the arrival and inventory of dried scallops have been scarce, and consumption is still active. In addition, the production price continues to rise, which is the fundamental reason for the rise. Yesterday's market price for round medium-grain dried scallops was 3,400 yuan to 3,500 yuan, and for triangular dried scallops, it was 3,200 yuan, an increase of 100 yuan compared to the previous day. The market trend was stable.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Honeysuckle Market Flat <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>There has been no continuous arrival of honeysuckle recently, and no new goods have been opened. However, the market trend has flattened because the flow in all directions has gradually become normal. Yesterday, the higher market price was 1,400 yuan, and the next highest was 1,300 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Old Knife Brand Cigarettes Widely Sought After <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The cigarette market suddenly became tight because the silver and money gangs were sparing no effort in searching for cigarettes. The most notable was the Old Knife brand, so the price was good. The selling price of Japanese cigarettes turned from rising to flat, showing a temporary break, but the trend was still easy to rise and difficult to fall. The trading price for Great Britain Brand was 8,400 yuan, Old Knife Brand was 5,510 yuan, Pin Hai Brand was 4,900 yuan, and Wuhua Brand was 3,600 yuan, all up 200 yuan. Little Fairy Brand rose 100 yuan. The prices of Japanese cigarettes initially weakened and then strengthened, such as Golden Gun Brand at 1,670 yuan, which returned to 1,700 yuan, Golden Building Brand at 1,950 yuan, Red Rose at 1,300 yuan, Quanlu Brand at 1,850 yuan, Nianzhi at 1,880 yuan, and Guide Brand at 1,450 yuan, with prices rising and falling compared to the previous day. The base of domestic cigarettes was still good, with Golden Mouse Brand at 1,800 yuan, Beauty Brand at 3,000 yuan, and Pyramid Brand at 3,200 yuan, continuing to rise by 100 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e70">Some Thoughts on This Year's Scholarship <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Month</p>
<p>The details of this newspaper's third scholarship have been generally reported. Here, we want to share some thoughts.</p>
<p>Although the process of conducting the identification examination was cumbersome this time, we obtained a lot of valuable material. All of the test questions will be released after the approved list is announced for the reference of students in various schools. During the identification examination, the order was very good. If the general students in the school have such a good academic atmosphere, we should be fortunate. The facts may not be entirely true, but what can be proven is that "poor and excellent" is a fact. We dare not predict the performance of wealthy children in school examinations, but their solemn spirit should be comparable.</p>
<p>In the middle school common sense section of the test questions, the number of people and grains in the third phase of household registration was used as one of the tests. Although this seems to be an ordinary test, it is a powerful piece of evidence for our investigation of students' family situations. In other words, if a student's answer is very far from the actual situation, their family may not be very poor. In addition, there are also tests on hygiene. Our intention is to hope that although the students are poor, they should pay attention to the nutrition of their food.</p>
<p>Judging from the general examination situation, the scores recorded by each school seem to have different degrees of strictness. According to more reliable standards, students from schools that are stricter in handling the exams can achieve outstanding results, and few fail. On the contrary, the percentage of passing students in schools with lower curricula and looser management will naturally decrease. Moreover, schools with higher tuition fees are not necessarily schools with strict management. These facts show that we have learned a lot from our scholarship work. At the same time, it may also be of some help to the teaching of various schools in the future.</p>
<p>There are many good compositions from the students, but we are not satisfied with the general level. We feel that many of the students' compositions lack substance. "My Reading Experience" and "My Summer Life" - these topics should have concrete points, rather than more discussion than facts. Useful writing cannot be separated from facts. Writing that is separated from facts is not worth paying attention to, nor is it what we hope from the students.</p>
<p>The result of the test is the list of approved scholarship recipients. Among them, some students passed the exam, but their family economy is still manageable, so they were not approved in order to ensure the purpose of the scholarship. There are also students whose families are very poor, even assisting with chores after school and having no time to study on their own. Considering the circumstances, corresponding assistance was provided. In other words, only poor and excellent students meet the scholarship criteria. Excellent but not very poor students should be excluded. We hope that when the next scholarship is held, non-poor students do not need to apply. If all poor students are excellent, although the amount of the scholarship may not be enough to meet the requests of the applicants, we are confident that those who donate from all walks of life will be able to do their best to make up for this deficiency.</p>
<p>Personalities</p>
<h3 id="e71">Gandhi - The Soul of India <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Bei</p>
<p>In order to lead the active independence movement of India, Gandhi, that short, thin, brown-skinned person wrapped in a piece of homespun cloth, that Mahatma, and other leaders of the Indian independence movement, have once again been arrested by the British government. This eccentric seventy-one-year-old man knows that this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity will vanish in an instant, so he is willing to risk his old life to fight for the liberation and freedom of his 350 million oppressed compatriots. The future destiny of India will largely be determined by this event.</p>
<p>The Idol of the Masses</p>
<p>In India, Gandhi has long been an idol of the masses. In thousands upon thousands of simple huts, hanging his portrait is considered an honor. When children are sick, and anxious adults are at their wits' end, they use Gandhi's photo to represent good medicine, hoping it will heal them. Wherever his train passes, farmers travel dozens of miles to wait respectfully by the railway, even though the train does not stop and Gandhi will not come out to greet them, they are still willing to do so. When he is about to give a speech, thousands of listeners arrive the night before to occupy good seats. Everywhere he goes, farmers compete to kneel down and kiss the ground where he has stepped. It can be said that all of India is obsessed with Gandhi.</p>
<p>The two words "Gandhi" in Indian mean "grocer." The Indian people, to worship him, respect him as a "Mahatma," which means "great soul." Many people close to him call him "Bapu," which means father. In his early years, his family called him "Bhai," which means brother. Still others call him "Gandhiji," the character "ji" meaning mister, but with a sense of affection. As for those in the organization, they often call him their "supreme commander."</p>
<p>Non-violent Resistance</p>
<p>Gandhi advocated non-violent resistance in his early years. This is a non-cooperation movement. Many people misunderstand it as non-resistance, which is a huge mistake, because non-resistance and non-violent resistance are vastly different. His instructions to participants in non-violent resistance are: do not get angry, do not insult, do not resist when attacked, surrender when arrested, and never insult the enemy. He even wants his disciples to help British soldiers and police who are attacked by Indians who disobey orders. He hates violence, and he also hates meeting violence with violence, but he believes that there is something worse than violence, and that is cowardice.</p>
<p>In order to launch this unprecedented non-violent disobedience movement, he was repeatedly arrested and imprisoned. Even he himself says he can't remember how many times he has been imprisoned and how many days he has spent in prison. In his early years, when he was a lawyer in South Africa, he was arrested and imprisoned three times. In 1922, when he was arrested and tried for launching the non-cooperation movement, he asked the judge with the utmost sincerity to impose the heaviest penalty, believing that unless he did so, he would not be able to atone for his sins. When the judge read out the verdict, he stood up to express his respect for the prisoner, sentencing him to six years in prison. Upon hearing the sentence, Gandhi politely expressed his thanks to the judge. Such a scene of courteousness in court can be said to be rare in the world. In fact, Gandhi showed no fear or unwillingness towards imprisonment, and it can be said that he regarded imprisonment as commonplace. Usually, his affairs are complex and numerous, and imprisonment is his only opportunity to rest and write. He himself said that he was "as happy as a bird" in prison.</p>
<p>The Meaning of Fasting</p>
<p>Speaking of Gandhi's imprisonment, one naturally has to mention his fasting. Because every time he encounters something he considers unfortunate, he always expresses his repentance by fasting. The British government is particularly troubled by Gandhi's fasting, because every time he fasts in prison, it always attracts worldwide attention. Towards the end of the fast, because his body is weakened, the British government always has to release him to avoid a major incident from happening. Because the British government knows that Gandhi cannot die, especially not in a British prison; otherwise, all of India will fall into an uncontrollable state. In 1921, on one occasion, while implementing non-violent resistance, the masses lost control and attacked and burned British police officers. Gandhi was heartbroken upon hearing this, calling the incident "a Himalayan blunder," and immediately stopped the non-cooperation movement and held his first major fast to express his repentance. In 1925, because of a major conflict between Indian and Muslim believers, Gandhi fasted for twenty-one days to promote awareness on both sides, almost fatally. On the last day, he only drank a little orange juice and was so weak that he could barely speak. Later, he once again fasted for twenty-one days for the lowest class of people in India. On another occasion, it is said that because one of his female disciples had an affair with twenty-one comrades, and he discovered it, he was truly heartbroken. As a result, in addition to expelling the female disciple and the twenty-one comrades, he himself fasted for twenty-one days to show his repentance for the twenty-two people. Some say that if that female disciple had had affairs with a few more people, Gandhi might have been in danger of fasting to death.</p>
<p>Vegetarian</p>
<p>Influenced by Hinduism, Gandhi was a vegetarian from an early age. When he was studying law in London, he was already a member of the executive committee of the London Vegetarian Society. It is said that when he was young, a friend told him that the British were strong because they ate meat, and the Indians were weak perhaps because they were vegetarians. Therefore, he decided to use himself as an experimental subject, ate a meal of mutton, and as a result, he felt sick in his heart and was disturbed by nightmares that night, dreaming that a live sheep was constantly bleating in his stomach. From then on, he dared not eat meat again, and hated it like an enemy.</p>
<p>Although Gandhi is a vegetarian and fasts at the drop of a hat, in fact, his appetite is not small. Each meal he eats includes a cup of goat's milk, a spoonful of honey, and also dates, nuts, garlic, oranges, jackfruit, mangoes, peaches, and other things. Usually, goat's milk is his main food. After sunset, he does not eat salt, tea, or meals.</p>
<p>Devout Believer</p>
<p>Gandhi is a devout believer and prays every morning and evening. Sometimes at any meeting, as long as he thinks the time has come, he ignores everything else, sits on the ground, and begins his prayer. In the air of the British House of Commons committee, this reckless behavior of his once caused great surprise to British gentlemen. Monday is his routine day of silence, no matter what important events occur, he always keeps his mouth shut and never wavers. But if you want to ask what religion Gandhi believes in, I'm afraid no one can say. I think it's better to let him express it in his own words. He said: "I see all things around me constantly changing, constantly dying. Under all the changes, there is a living force that does not change, organizing everything, creating everything, and dissolving everything. That force that gives everything life and dominion is God. I believe God is holy and benevolent, because I can see that in the midst of death, life is still eternal; in the midst of dishonesty, truth continues; in the midst of darkness, light continues to persist. Therefore, I infer that God is life, truth, and light. God is love, is supreme good." He is a devout Hindu, but he believes that all the great scriptures of the world are equally the word of God.</p>
<p>What Gandhi loves most are children, fresh air, laughter, friends, and truth. What he hates most is lying.</p>
<p>Reduce oneself to Zero</p>
<p>Gandhi has a very long autobiography. After writing one thousand and ninety pages, his last sentence is: "I must reduce myself to zero." The seeds of all the flowers, grasses, grains, and other plants in the world must "reduce themselves to zero" before new life can grow and before there can be a bountiful harvest. In this key moment of success or failure in the Indian independence movement, the last sentence in Gandhi's autobiography is especially worthy of savoring.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Sleep Skill <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Mu</p>
<p>Gandhi has a special skill: he can fall asleep within thirty seconds of getting on a train, and he can say before going to sleep that he wants to take a nap for twenty-five minutes, and wake up exactly at twenty-five minutes. This kind of skill cannot be achieved without extremely deep cultivation.</p>

<h3 id="e74">Weaver Girl of the Milky Way <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— Lü Huanxun</p>
<p>Three Thousand Feet of White Silk</p>
<p>After completing half a month of day shifts, it was time to take the night shift as usual. Out at sunset and rest at sunrise, the long twelve hours were enough to make you cry out, "How long is the night?" Before twelve o'clock, the partners were always energetic and did not take a break; but after midnight, it was actually the next morning, especially from two to five o'clock in the morning, every companion showed signs of fatigue. The eyes were the most unbearable. It's no wonder, under the dazzling electric lights, squeezing their eyeballs, paying attention to every fine thread, half a strand of hair, breaking, knotting, escaping, finding, without a moment's negligence. Some companions closed their eyelids and dozed off, which was really funny. When the weft was finished, she didn't know, or when a hole was made, she still didn't know; when she discovered it, she had to admit her bad luck and remove the flawed shuttle, and these wasted hours were a loss of income, the price of dozing. Several experienced people were different, they were very alert and could wake up at the moment when the weft was about to finish, without any accident. Even more people wanted to avoid dozing off, cheer up, raised their voices, and chanted along with the rhythm of the loom: some joked with the partners next to the machine, and actually talked and laughed, driving away the doze demon. And I often stared blankly at this never-ending warbler, couldn't help but shout, "For whom are you working so hard?"</p>
<p>"Three thousand feet of white silk" can probably be completed in a year. If there is a weaver girl with three or four years of history, she will have at least ten thousand feet of achievements. Assuming that the length of each piece of clothing material is one foot, then she has made ten thousand pieces of clothing material for the world. Of course, the clothes of ten thousand people are woven by her hand, thread by thread.</p>
<p>"A song of barbarian song, a piece of silk from the East, the beauty still dislikes it lightly, do you know that under the cold window of the weaver girl, how much effort it takes to weave it?" This is a poem of indignation written by an ancient weaver girl. Naturally, the rich wives and young ladies change clothes in the morning and evening, and the wardrobe is full of dazzling things. As long as they enjoy comfort, how can they know that every thread is the blood and tears of the weaver girls?</p>
<p>The general situation of the lives of weaver girls has already been said. Finally, I still have a little feeling: the silk weaving industry in China has the longest history. Although it is much more advanced than the hand weaving industry in the past, compared with other countries in the world, it is really inferior and insignificant. The Soviet Union has a large factory with 25,000 looms, which China does not have at all. Up to now, silk merchants still use goods transported from Europe and the United States as their selling point, which should be considered a disgrace by all Chinese silk weaving employees. Every one of us employees should bury our heads in hard work, strive for perfection, and seek to wash away our shame, and at the same time, for the revitalization of our industry, especially for the leaders with status and strength in the silk weaving industry, we place deep hope.

<p>(8) What Can Be Done?</p>
<p>This evening, Mrs. Ye Er was also lying in bed, perked up her ears, and waited until dawn before she fell asleep groggily. This was another day, and no one went to disturb Mrs. Ye Er, but Mrs. Ye Er suddenly woke up. Waking up, she called out, "Weicheng, come here, why was Miss Chen crying to you?" Cui Zhen had just walked outside the room, and was surprised when she heard it. She walked in to take a look, only Mrs. Ye Er was alone, speaking with sleepy eyes. Cui Zhen smiled and said, "Second Aunt, Brother Cheng hasn't come back yet. Are you saying that because he's back?" Mrs. Ye Er was stunned, and forced a smile, "I was dreaming, it was like Weicheng was telling me that Miss Chen was crying to him. It turned out to be a dream. Has Weicheng come back after all? Has the snow melted? Has the weather cleared?" Cui Zhen answered her one by one, and she was worried again, saying, "Why didn't I think of calling He Ziyu to run to Shuangqiao yesterday? He Zixing went, and there would have been solid news early today."</p>
<p>Cui Zhen was still able to think of things that others couldn't think of. She had already sent He Zixing to Shuangqiao this morning; in He Zixing's eyes, what Cui Zhen's position was in the Ye family, he didn't know as well as Cui Zhen, but He Zixing was very obedient, and he went when Cui Zhen wanted him to go. So when Mrs. Ye Er regretted it, Cui Zhen truthfully reported it to her.</p>
<p>It was like yesterday again, suddenly it was noon, suddenly it was evening. In the cold days and short days, Mrs. Ye Er and Cui Zhen always felt like they were living like years. By evening, Weicheng and A Xing hadn't returned, but He Zixing had returned. Although he was a farmhand, he was standing on the line of employment, but when he reached outside the fence, Mrs. Ye Er and others greeted him. Only the mud on He Zixing's feet, splashed above his calves, showed the results of his hard work. When he saw the mistress, he said, "Neither the young master nor A Yu are at the Chen family in Shuangqiao." (153)</p>

<p>— Jia Ji</p>
<p>Once, Gandhi's body was weakened by fasting, and his weight was reduced to ninety-seven pounds. The doctor instructed him to eat twice as much food so that his weight would increase to one hundred and four pounds. After considering it, Gandhi refused the doctor's suggestion to increase his food intake, but told the doctor that he had decided to increase his weight to one hundred and four pounds in a week. In a week, his weight did increase as planned, and the doctor was amazed.</p>
