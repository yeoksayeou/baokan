<h3>法要人繼續會談內閣卽宣布改組賴伐爾將任政府領袖達蘭仍兼三軍總司令</h3>
<p>維希十五日海通社電據悉貝當達蘭與賴伐爾三人在星期四兩度會談後、即可決定新政府名單、而予以發表、昨晨三人在花園飯店集議時、法國與德當局主要經濟官二人、即梅興與白里農民亦列席參加、關於新政府陣容、現尙未能獲悉、但衆信達蘭海軍上將仍當爲元首繼承人、並爲法國陸海空三軍總司令、有權列席內閣會議、但將不具部長職銜、又賴伐爾則將任政府之領袖、而貝當元帥仍將任內閣會議主席、一如過去、貝當元帥已不復具政府領袖之權利、但頓伐爾則應向貝當負責、</p>
<p>維希十五日海通　法電法情報部秘書長馬里翁昨稱、賴伐爾之名銜、將爲政府之領袖、至於內閣總理及協理之名稱、則將完全廢止、賴伐爾對元首負責、至於達蘭將仍爲元首之繼承人、其名銜爲陸海空軍總司令、放棄部長之名、得參加各種之內閣會議、此後貝當將僅任元首、至內閣會議之主席一職、或將由賴伐爾兼攝、</p>
<p>維希十五日海通社電　法政府今日將貝當·達蘭及賴伐爾三人討論之結果、正式通吿法國民衆、消息靈通人士指陳、貝當與賴伐爾之合作、乃係遵循蒙特窪政策、易言之、德法兩國密切合作是也、賴伐爾之出膺重寄、就內政外交之基本政策言、並無完全更變之意義、賴伐爾一向了解法國之眞正利益、且能於危急存亡之秋、謀法國之眞正利益、是以貝當請其出山、</p>
<p>日內瓦十四日哈瓦斯社電據此間政界人士談稱、一俟法國當局所進行之談話宣告結束、該國新政府即可組織成立、預料前任內閣總理賴伐爾將出任閣揆、觀於維希公報所稱、法國內閣將依照新的原則、設立新政府一點、可知法國政局行將發生重大變化、匪特人事更迭、抑且政府形式亦將有所改變、截至目下爲止、貝當元首同時兼任國務會議主席、將來新政府中、國家元首之職權、仍由一人掌握、永不改變固矣、但政府首腦亦即內閣總理之職權、則將由元首於閣員中遴選一人行使之、預料貝當上將仍爲元首、而前任內閣總理賴伐爾、則將出任閣揆、而在貝當元首領導之下、行使職權、至於內閣協理達蘭中將、依照根本大法之規定、仍爲貝當元首之繼承人、並以海·陸·空三軍最高統帥之資格、參加內閣會議、準此而論、在政府根本組織上、雖不致發生重大變化、但在治權的組織方面、則將略有修改、此外、關於其他閣員人選、外間猜測不一、迄今尙無確實消息、惟此間政界人士預料、法政府將於三月十六日正式宣布改組內閣、</p>
<h3>法閣改組消息引起英美注意傳法有對英宣戰可能</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十五日海通社電據此間得倫敦息、法政府之改組、引起倫敦方面之注意、此次之新發展、被認爲英、美聯盟之另一敗績、倫教報紙更論及倫敦與華盛頓間之交換意見、故美國有對維希施行壓力之可能、因法政府改組之謠言、早於星期一晚流傳於倫敦、故昨日之晨報上已有關於此事之評論、「每日通報」之外交通訊稱、法國艦隊尙有相當之實力、而駐在北非之法軍、其實力亦甚雄厚、故法國有對英宣戰之可能、</p>
<p>柏林十五日海通社電維希公報所稱貝當元帥、達蘭海軍上將以及賴伐爾三人決議另組法國新政府事、德外部昨夜拒不加以評論、蓋因尙未接獲此事之情報也、</p>
<p>里斯本十五日海通社電　紐約息、法國公報所稱、法元首貝當上將、副總理達蘭及前總理賴伐爾決定根據新原則而成立政府、已引起美國人之注意、此訊抵達紐約數分鐘後、美國所有之無綫電報吿員宣稱、賴伐爾之重返內閣、爲美國加緊對決政策之後果、政界方面不信華盛頓不日將發表、關於此事之官方態態、惟副國務卿威爾斯將請求法驻美大使海亨利對局勢加以解釋、一部份人士甚至認爲、賴伐爾入閣後、將引起美國召回駐維希大使李希之可能、</p>
<h3>美駐法大使將被召回美報主對法決裂</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城十五日同盟社雷此間收得之澳洲廣播稱、美國駐維希大使李希、將被召回華盛頓與美政府商談、</p>
<p>華盛頓十四日路透社電消息靈通方面預料、美駐維希大使李希、將被召回、美政府髙級官員坦白承認、維希檢討美國與維希之關係、實爲必要、惟據指陳、李希之被召回、非爲斷絕外交關係之謂、此間人士有預測美國將與維希完全絕交、而予自由法國人士以全力支持者、惟消息靈通方面則吿各方勿遽作論斷、</p>
<p>華盛頓十五日路透社電華盛頓郵報今日刊文、批評賴伐爾復在維希掌權事、籲請美國承認特戈爾派爲「眞正法蘭西之眞正政府」、賴伐爾之仟新職、今爲外交界談論之主題、許多人士感覺使維希弗與德國更密切合作之希望、現終吿破裂、而美國若對維希續取同情政之策、亦屬無用、故「明白決裂」之時、現已至矣、同時、美國務部截至今晚爲止、尙未從維希接獲法內閣改組事之情報、然憶美政府過去對於頓伐爾向採不妥洽之態度、今料維希方面將抱尋寡政策、昨日華盛頓關於美國對自由法國當局之政策、所提牒文之遭拒絕、可見端倪、美官塲是否今尙信任維希一再提出守中立及忠實遵守休戰條件之保證、殊成疑問、法·美關係之最近發展、殊使消息向來靈通人士震驚、蓋彼等皆信達蘭在法政府一日、決不許賴伐爾東山再起也、</p>
<h3>羅斯福氏態度緘默</h3>
<p>里斯本十五日海通社電華盛頓電訊、羅斯福總統昨在情報會議席上、對某記者係於賴伐爾重入法國內閣一事之詢問、採取緘默態度、僅謂可向國務院探詢評論、</p>
<p>華盛頓十五日路透社電　迄至昨日深晚爲止、關於維希內閣更迭事、國務院迄未獲何消息、維希在過去雖迭宣布中立政策並揚言願忠實履行休戰協定之規定、此種表示是否可加信賴、此問官方甚爲懷疑、此開雖知維希政府或擬在目下情形之下採取行動、定使美國不得不對維希實行絕交、惟此間仍認爲美國不擬採取主動、對維希斷絕邦交、此間消息靈通方面原以爲在達蘭在位一日、賴伐爾不致秉政是以消息靈通方面獲悉賴伐爾再度秉政之訊以後、大爲震動、聞一旦美國與維希斷絕邦交、維希方面在美人員若干人仍擬留美、</p>
<h3>美對抗議覆文維希拒絕接受美衆院求佔法屬地與特戈爾派密切合作</h3>
<p>維希十四日哈瓦斯社電關於美國將在法屬赤道非洲特戈爾派中心勃拉柴維爾城設立總領事館一事、法政府曾向美國當局提出抗議、美國復文亦已送達、法政府爰於本日訓令駐美大使海亨利、着其向美國聲明、法政府對於此項復文、礙難接受、關於此事、法國半官方面頃發表文吿稱、「關於美國在勃拉柴維爾城設立總領事館一事、我方向美國提出抗議後、我駐美大使海亨利已於四月十三日接獲美國國務院之復文、當即轉達政府、査此項覆文內容、匪特措詞傲慢、且其目的乃在减低我忠實國民愛國活動之價値、我國政府當即訓令海亨利大使，着其通知美國國務卿、吿以法政府礙難接受此項覆文、法國人民自知如何愛國、無庸外人代爲敎導、此外、尙有一點爲法政府所不能不鄭重聲明者、即美政府此次違違外交慣例、立即將此項覆文予以發表、其含有宜傳目的、灼然可見、至於法國照會中所提出之問題、美國來文反無隻字加以答覆」、</p>
<p>柏林十五日海通社電　德外部昨評美國對法政府抗議美國在法屬赤道非洲勃拉柴維爾設置領事署之覆文稱、美副國務卿威爾斯在覆文中曾稱、美國此舉係爲法人利益着想、但當威爾斯於　九四〇年遊歐時、曾充分顯露其對於歐洲事件之不了解、威爾斯今猶信法國民族之命運可由華盛頓支配、</p>
<p>瑞典京城十五日海通社電據華盛頓消息、美衆院已要求政府佔領法國屬地、因其對美國之軍略上佔有重要之地位、衆院同時又要求政府與特戈爾派密切合作、衆認該院之此種態度、爲法政府改組之直接結果、</p>

<h3>印度問題專輯　二種族與之動宗敎</h3>
<p>上海人叫印度人稱爲「印度黑　」，實在很妙。很妙並不就是很對的意思。所以說是很妙者，因爲說是對也可以，說是不對也可以。這其中究有什麽玄妙呢？看官們莫性急，目聽我慢慢道來。</p>
<p>誰都知道印度是個古國。但是究竟古到什麽程度呢？說來也要使人咋舌。原來照人類學大家的研究，印度　是人類的起源地帶啊。根據開痕敎授（A．　H　K　eane）的設想，人類最初的形體，與今日的黑人最最相近，其起源地域，是稱爲印度澳洲地域，就是從印度某一地點起，一方面連接澳洲，一方面連接非洲的一塊大陸。後來大地沈沒而爲印度洋隔絕時，人類便西退而入非洲，向東北進而入印度及馬來諸島，南退而入於澳洲的。人類就這樣分佈開來的。所以住居在非洲及印度的黑人，稱爲奈格利督（Negrito）的，是黑人系中最近於原始人最爲幼稚的人類。現在盂加拉灣中安達曼（Andaman　Is）羣島上，有一種矮身反　的冥可比族（Mincopie）便是原始黑人的一種代表云。照此看來，印度最初的人種，豈不是眞正道地老大房的「黑炭」嗎？所以上海人叫印度人爲印度黑炭倒也不可厚非；可是名副其實的黑炭，却只有這種印度原始黑人，其餘便不是，甚至不是「黑炭」，而竟是「白煤」呢。印度至今最爲得勢，做其代表的民族的，便是和歐洲人一樣的「白煤」，——印度亞早安人種。</p>
<p>黑炭是印度國開天闢地的最初拓荒者，其次去印度的是特拉維達種人（Dravidians）。他們是經過旁甲普而入中央印度，將原住人的初民加以壓力，而迫使轉居於南印度。這種特拉維達人的子孫，就是現在的泰彌爾族，台爾格族和卡那利族等等，其次移住於印度的，便是和歐洲人同樣長身白皙的印度亞利安民族。他們離開了原住地的中央亞細亞越過了興度苦希（Hindn　Knhs）山脈，而居留於印度的西北部。亞利安一語，如用梵語翻譯，普通是譯作「聖」字的，就是髙貴的意思。原來因爲這種人民身體髙大，皮膚白皙，智勇兼備，較之印度先住民族更爲優秀，不免自學自大的緣故。亞利安民族先在旁甲普地方居留下來，經營蓄牧，漸次向東南擴張勢力，而入恒河流域，將原來居住的特拉維達人民趕到南方去，更逐漸獲得勢力而成爲印度人的主體，迄今不變。上海的印度人中未必沒有奈格利督的苗裔，但終究以亞利安人的子孫爲多，是則稱印度人爲黑炭，那又不對了</p>
<p>印度亞利安人雖則做了印度代表的民族，但在其後以大集團的姿態，移居於印度的民族，還是不少。西方去的系統，則有大夏的希臘人，他們越過興度苦希山脈，而寄居於健駄羅以至旁甲普一帶地域。又以交通關係，政治關係，西隣的波斯人等，多少和印度也有來往的。東面去印的系統，則有原來居民住於中國西部的月氏族及塞族等。月氏族中會產生過一個迦膩色　王，征服印度的北半部而建立了貴霜大王朝，雄飛中外，這是在印度史上大書而特書的。但是這種種民族並不像亞利安族那麼能席捲全個印度，其侵略的地域，只限於印度的西北部罷了。還有蒙古人種從希馬拉雅山的東北路侵入印境。據說現在孟加拉人便是蒙古人和特拉維達的混血子孫云。至於從海路去印度，那比較是落後的事情了。稍遠的是猶太人和亞刺伯人到十五世紀末，才有歐洲人在印登陸，其後即接踵而至，甚至將印度變爲英國的附庸。</p>
<p>現在印度人口約有三萬萬三四千萬，是從許多種族集合而成的，同時也是多種複雜的混血種族。所以就搆成國家的民族內容言，不論從人種觀察，或者從歷史觀察，印度這個國家實在複雜得很，其於全體文化，社會組織上，自然有直接影響，而也繁複起來了。不過印度民族的中心，爲印度國家社會的主體的，旣不是最早的黑人，也不是後來的希臘，波斯，亞刺伯，月氏，塞族等等，而是印度亞利安族，所以談印度一切問題，只要一把抓住亞利安人，便抓住了印度種族方面的核心了。</p>
<p>印度人的習慣，見了陌生人，不問你是什麽地方的人，而問你是什麼宗敎中人。可見印度和宗敎關係的深切了。印度社會組織中最最重要的種姓，雖傳說是人世創造以來，就有這種階級的差別，而實際是不能脫出宗敎的意味。印度最早的婆蘿門敎敎義稱，從古吠陀時代起，同樣是人，而婆蘿門族說是從梵天的頭頂生出的，刹帝利族是從梵天的肩上生出的，吠舍族和首陀羅族是從梵天的腿脚生出的。這是四種姓的神話的起源。四種姓中第一位的婆羅門姓，是司祭祠的僧侶階級，掌握宗敎上的實權，其他種姓中人有時且視之若神明。第二位的刹帝利姓，是掌握國權的國王及一般的士族階級。他們握有政治上的全權，從事軍務，以保護國家及人民爲其本分。第三位的吠舍種，是從事農工商等的生產業務的平民階級，他們對於國家有納稅的義務。第四位的普陀羅，那是奴隸階級，是四種姓中之最下者，共唯一的職業，便是以勞力服侍上面的三姓。這四姓階級的區分，婆羅門信以爲是神定的，決不可以變更，如果混亂了，便叛逆神的規定而致社會紊亂。種姓開始雖只此四種，但是後來愈分愈淸，愈分愈多，到現在，印度竟有二千三四百種姓之多了！</p>
<p>在紀元前五世紀時，從風糜婆羅門敎的印度亞利安民族中，忽然創出一種新宗敎來了，那種宗敎一反四姓制度，主張打破階級的，那便是釋尊所創的佛敎。佛敎是最髙權威的思想與宗敎，也不用費辭的了。可是發祥於印度的這種佛敎，在其產生地現在卻已微弱得很的了，只是在東北部西藏邊境地方和南方錫蘭還保持一點勢力而已。佛敎在印度是被印度敎所擠出去的。所謂　度敎者，簡單說來，是當紀元八世紀時有一種新婆難門敎出現，他們並不像原來婆羅門那麽具有髙遠的知慧與哲學，祭祠着許許多多的天神，據說有三萬萬三千萬的神道呢！在十五世紀時又將回敎敎義也收納進去，爲了迎合一般紙級的人民起見，甚至供奉着生殖器崇拜之神體的。印度敎雖稱爲回返婆羅門敎，實際是宗敎的逆轉。但印度敎正是印度人民所歡迎的宗敎，於是在印度，把佛敎驅逐出境，至今掌握印度最大的宗敎勢力。照德國人的印度宗敎統計，大約如下：</p>
<p>（　印度敎　佔全印人口百分之六八·五　回敎　佔全印人口百分之个一二·七　佛敎　佔全印人口百分之四　拜物敎　佔全印人口百分之三　塞克敎　佔全印人口百分之一　基督敎　佔全印人口百分之一·五　其他　佔全印人口百分之〇·三</p>
<p>從上表看來，印度敎的勢力如何巨大，便可概知的了。印度半島的中部和南部幾乎全是印度敎的勢力圍範。西北部的旁甲普與辛特，乃是回敎徒的樂土，但在孟加拉下流也有別的回敎徒地域。至於塞克敎則在旁甲普境內，拜物敎則在半島上印度敎中間夾雜着的。</p>
<p>印度的宗敎在其自治問題上也很有關係，照印度的民族主義者，不論是印度敎徒或是回敎徒，他們都是主張以宗敎的差別爲、永久的政治區劃，更能使自治强化云。</p>

<h3>戰雲密佈下　錫蘭島的姿態</h3>
<p>從報紙戰出的消息看來，太平洋戰事中的陸上軍事行動，除非列賓呂宋島的巴打半島上有局部攻守戰外，似已暫告停頓；一般推度日軍今後的行動方向，不出印度和澳洲，觀於印澳局的實施種種戒備，足見風去的緊急。</p>
<p>澳洲方面，日軍早已在澳本土北面的新幾內亞島登陸，志在攻取摩勒斯比港，俾以此為根據地，就近攻擊澳洲，所以新幾內亞可說澳洲的前哨，其得失對於澳洲本身的影響極大。印度方面，也有類似新幾內亞之於澳洲的前哨，道便是錫蘭島。鍚蘭島和印度大陸，祇隔着一條派爾克海峽，正如親幾內亞和澳洲祗隔着托萊海峽一樣。锡蘭島现在是英帝国的直屬殖民地，其首府科侖坡日前已遭日本海军飛機初次轟炸。由往例觀之，空襲往往是軍隊進攻的先聲，所以這幾天鍚蘭島已引起世人的注意。</p>
<p>考錫蘭島地形，略似生梨，梨尖向北，全島面積二五，三三二方哩，約較我國浙江省的三分之二略小，北面以曼那灣和派爾克海峽與印度隔分。島上氣溫隨地勢的高低而異，最高的地方是庇特魯泰賴茄拉，（八，二九六呎）和亞當山峯（七，三五二呎，）但以整個而言，鍚蘭島雖位於熱帶，除低窪之地外，氣候尚無礙於康健，天時以十二月和一月最凉，四月和五月最熱。</p>
<p>鍚蘭島在古時有種種名稱如古希臘人和羅馬人喚之為泰普洛斑Taprobane後來西方和東方人著書，又稱之為塞蘭迪勃Serendib西林特爾Sirindul和齊蘭Zeylan等等。錫蘭島最早的居民，也許是維逹人的祖先，維逹人是一個原始的小部落以行獵為生，現居東部森林中：今人會在維逹人所居的穴中，掘出太古時代的粗石器，中見他們居住該島，不知已有多少年代了。</p>
<p>印度的著名古代史詩「羅摩延」一書，載有印度古英雄賴那及其從者征服錫蘭島一部份，並佔鍚蘭島王賴華那的京城的事蹟。這故事是不吸事實為根據，不得而知，從有其事，則佔領的時期亦不長久。今人所能追溯的鍚蘭島可靠歷史，始自紀元前五四三年，是年辛哈里斯五朝的始祖維迦雅，率隊從印度大陸出發，在鍚蘭島登陸，以較高的文明輸入鍚蘭。而於耕耘，尤所專長；阿努融特哈浦拉附近灌漑田地的最古大水糟，便是維迦雅的即位人在紀元前約五〇四年開闢的。紀元前晦三世紀初葉，阿索卡王子　興遠人鍚蘭島傳佈佛敎，得全島居民的信仰。厥後，印度西部瑪拉巴海岸的塔迷爾人侵入鍚蘭，常施統治，但紀無後一〇七一年，辛哈里斯王萌復立。</p>
<p>一四〇八年，（明成祖永樂六年）中國因出使鍚蘭受辱，興兵征討辛哈里斯朝，攻入鍚蘭，俘回維迦雅巴赫王四世，其後三十年，辛哈里斯王每年向中國朝貢。</p>
<p>一五〇五年葡萄牙人阿爾梅逹抵鍚蘭。見該島已分成七個王國。十一年後，印度西海岸戈亞區總督下令在科侖坡興建區壘，自是而後，以迄十七世紀荷人興起，葡人在鍚蘭致力於統治權的樹立，迭興該島土酋和阿刺伯人交戰，頗獲勝利。一六三八年，荷軍遠征鍚蘭，攻毀東海岸的葡人堡壘。至一六五八年，葡人終被逐出其在鍚蘭島的最後據點迦夫那。一七九五年，英葆絕交，英軍遠片，攻佔鍚蘭，一八〇三年訂密昂條約，將這荷蘭的殖民地正式割予英國；一八一五年三月二日英國與鍚蘭島坎第亞族酋長訂約，宣布該島的整個主權，盡歸英王。</p>
<p>鍚蘭島人口，現不足六百萬人，辛哈里斯　人約佔什七，餘者多數是塔迷爾人，此外還有多種民族，其大者是阿刺伯人，後裔摩爾曼人信奉回敎。</p>
<p>鍚蘭島以農產為主，最重要的是供本島消耗的米，此外並產椰子，黑鉛，可可，肉桂，檸檬油，豆蔻，檳榔子，與烟草；鍚蘭島还有許多寶石發現，其最重要的是紅玉和青玉，曼那海灣中更可採珠。</p>
<p>首府科侖坡頗繁盛，有世界第五大都市之稱，居民約三十萬。科侖坡博物院建築巍峨，載有古物標本極夥，如古代葡人荷人的傢俱，辛哈里斯人的珠寶，象牙彫刻品，手抄書本，和銅器，維多利亞公園，阿素加拉瑪雅的佛敎大寺院，印度敎寺院，葡人佔據時的遺遺跡，荷人古敎堂和公墓，以及貝塔地主的回敎堂，都是著名的所在。（敏）</p>
<p>鍚蘭聖山</p>
<p>亞當峰是鍚蘭的聖山，這山雖只有七千三百尺高，但因山巔有一巨人的足遺跡，大家便目為很神聖的所在了。這「脚印」席約兩碼，各種宗敎的信仰者，都說這巨人的足跡是他們所信仰的巨神所留下來的。據說兩千年前，這聖山已為鍚蘭人所崇敬的了。</p>
<h3>匯豊銀行　開始三次提存　支付餘額百分之廿五麦加利定下週一開始</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、今日（十五日）搩悉、上海之英方主要銀行兩家、刻正以另一批存款、付給全體存戶、包括協約國存戶在內、其一係匯豊銀行、從今晨起在去歲十二月六日之原來結存款項中、續撥百分之二十五、開始付給各存戶、麦加利銀行則將從四月二十日即星期一起、開始撥付去歲十二月六日原來餘款之百分之三十、又聞花旗銀行亦將在短期內、撥付另一批存款、其日期或在下週內、惟確期尚未決定、</p>
<p>大小存戶提款總額</p>
<p>查此乃十二月八日太平洋戰事爆發以來撥會之第三批存款、以匯豊銀行言、現正再度撥會存款總額之百分之二十五、亦即被凍結的結存款項之半數、蓋上海被日軍進佔時、一切存款之半數、即移存黃濱正金銀行、結存之餘款、即予凍結、旋其中什五、已予撥付、故今日續付百分之二十五後、實際上小存戶已提出其去歲十二月六日結存餘款總數之百分之八十、大存戶之提郵餘款額、則從百分之七十五至八十不等、據匯豊某員解釋、大小存戶提出存款之百分比、所以差別者、乃因開戰後、會儘速以二千元撥給各存戶所致、以二千元存款之撥付目的、乃在協助小存戶、由此可知存款愈少者、其已提出存款之百分比愈高、</p>
<p>麦加利三次提存期</p>
<p>至於麦加利銀行亦將從星期一起、開始撥付第三批存款、其數為去歲十二月六日結存存款、除去二千元後之百分之三十、前後合計之提取百分率為原來餘款之百分之八十、查麦加利銀行會於本年一月十七日付出第一批存款二千元、第二批百分之五十、從一月十九日起付給、其後結存之餘款、已移存三井銀行、惟關於此等餘款之往來、仍在麦加利銀行辦理、下列存款則仍被暫時凍結、（甲）華人存款、超過一百元者、等候日當局對存戶之價實、有所決定、（乙）對該行負債存戶存款、等候其債務了清時解凍、對於非交戰國人民之存款、不加限制、至於所剩存款、約為原業餘款百分之二十五、預料終將一批或分批付迄、閉麦加利銀行目前尚不付款、</p>

<h3>海福輪　將駛定海</h3>
<p>五月初可實現</p>
<p>大通社云、海福輪行駛滬定綫、雖各項駛行上手續、日漸就緒、惟行駛尙無確期、哈納輪行駛寗波、未成事實、茲誌於后、</p>
<p>海福駛定　下月實現</p>
<p>禮和船務部之海福輪、現已回復華商舟山航業公司名義、決定駛上海定海綫、兼灣沈家門、其行駛上必要手續、漸已就緒、職務分配、亦已內定、惟行駛尙無確期、據航業界推測、大致五月初可望實現、</p>
<p>哈納開甬　未成事實</p>
<p>査該輪自去年停駛後、即停泊浦江董家渡浮筒、日前將船身加以　漆、茲已竣事、泊於該輪附近之哈納輪、亦經將船身髹漆、該輪爲德商遠東公司所有、前一度有行駛滬甬綫傳說、茲已沉寂、</p>
<p>謀福　定　無釋放訊</p>
<p>德商禮和洋行之謀福輪、為以前寗紹輪之前身、該輪去年在開駛溫州途中、被扣　泊定海　頭、該輪曾恢復原來船名、行駛滬甬綫之說、卒因該輪負責人均不在滬、無人作主而作罷論、故該輪迄猶扣泊定海、</p>
<p>滬甬各輪　客位有限</p>
<p>至現在行駛滬甬綫輪船、噸位均小、載客數量亦不多、每艘僅能容載搭客五六百人、當茲離滬回鄕人衆、致購票頗感困難、如無噸位較大航輪加入行駛、滬甬綫回甬旅客、殊受親旅之苦、</p>
<h3>離滬回甬人衆　寗波巿况繁榮</h3>
<p>大通社云、寗波·鎭海·慈谿·等地、近因旅滬者率多返里、市氣較前繁盛、茲誌如次、</p>
<p>寗波自去春因地方情形變遷、城區住民、類多移家他鄕、僅少數貧戶住居、不久因地方秩序恢復、移居他地居民、相率來歸、市面日就繁榮、近則已復舊觀、街巷行人、絡繹不絕、且治安方面、亦臻靜謐、四鄕情形略同、</p>
<p>鎭海邇來市面、業已恢復事變前之狀態、據該地來人謂、城區熱鬧地段、商肆羅列、行人熙攘、較半年前之冷寂景象、已有天壤之別、近且駛往滬甬各輪、均兼旁靠、是以旅客來往便捷、城區人口、陡增數倍、</p>
<p>慈谿城區情形、近數月來殊爲良好、日用品及食糧價格、與前略同、近來人口增髙二三倍、惟失業者衆多、故在熱鬧區內、設攤營小本生意者、爲數極多、旅居本埠之寗波·鎭海·慈谿·象山·奉化等籍同鄕、近因本市物價日趨激漲、且米煤購買困難、以故返籍者益衆、惟近日滬甬間直航輪隻、暫時停止附載搭客、以故一般急欲返籍者、均繞道定海沈家門等　、復乘帆船至鎭海、或再由鎭海轉往別地、聞途中需日雖多、尙無困難云、</p>
<h3>破獲盜黨　査出犯案甚多</h3>
<p>成都路捕房華探長宋秉正·探目孫文熹·張魁棟·日探長森進等、最近在東方旅館二五四號房間、吳淞路三八一弄五十九號·梧州路八十三弄十六號等處、徇獲劇盜朱世根·余谷良·曹克昌·張三寳·毛炳和·李土寳·林昌振·周阿炳等、並在北四川路仁智里七七六號門牌等處、抄得盒子砲一支、手槍三支、蓮蓬手槍三支、子彈四十餘粒、査得朱犯等曾犯有盜刦、　天潼路四七八弄二十三號華藝洋燭廠三萬餘元、　福州路會樂里十八號鶯紅書寓萬餘元之財物、　梅白格路九十七弄五十八號茂昌眼鏡公司主家二萬餘元財物、以及其他盜案約十餘起之多、當吊出價値萬餘元之首飾銀洋等臟物、乃併予收押、候調査有無其他犯案後再核、南通人朱桂生、五十八歲、因困於生活、飢餓難挨、乃於本年二月二十二日在愷自邇路貝勒路口搶奪人力車上之香烟、被捕拘案、在偵査中竟患病不起、送往醫院治療無效、於前日身死、因無家屬、尸由善堂殮埋、</p>
<p>貝勒路康悌路</p>
<p>汽車電車相撞</p>
<p>昨晨九時許、有黑牌汽車七五二號一輛、駛經法租界貝勒路康悌路口、適有法商電車公司十七路雷車（一五二號二輛駛來、两車不及避讓相撞、汽車車頭受損極重、電車亦略有損壞、南京路永安公司、三十年度紅利三分三厘三、改作升股後、舊股東之升股者、該公司掣有臨時收據、茲悉該項升股收據、已於本月十五日起、正式掉換股票、望持有升股收據者注意、</p>
<h3>房租收取新幣　租房呼籲减租</h3>
<p>最近本市一部份市屋業主、均先後聲明以新幣收取租金、其中實行者已極衆、惟大部租戶、以所付租金、倘以新幣繳付、則無異於原有租金上、加增三成、際此生活髙漲、已達度日維艱之困境、何能再增支出、故邇日有若干里弄住戶及商號、對業中收取新幣者、已紛紛呼籲、將原有房金减低三成、則雖繳付新幣、於情於理、可得公允、否則徒加增平民食擔、並聞當局對於此項問題、亦在考慮辦法中、</p>
<h3>上海的音樂界</h3>
<p>交春以後，上海的音樂界確曾蓬勃一時，一月來，單就公開的音樂會說，演奏的總不下十餘次，而且隨着電影片來源之劇减，上海人的興趣頗有一部份轉移於音樂的傾向，在每次演奏會裹，我們總能發現一批國人觀衆，這在以前是罕有的，他們或許還是年靑的音樂學徒，或許僅是個熱烈愛好者，然他們都有一種渴望，一種對高深藝術進一步之追求與理解，在一般情形下說，我們一不得不說這是種好現象。</p>
<p>上海雖是個國際大都市，然而音樂界向來非常冷漠，這多年來，支持這貧瘠的園地的，當然得推工部局樂隊，他們每星期日下午五時，經常在蘭心戲院演奏，指揮是意大利名音樂家Mario　Paci，這樂隊構成份子幾乎全是外人，我國人紙有陳又新馬思宏等三位，他們大都屬於德意俄國籍，第一提琴手爲Foa敎授，也是意大利人，他過去曾奏演獨奏多次，至於他的純熟的技巧，與髙深的修養，這該是聽衆們所熟習的。工部局樂隊在本年三月初會連續舉行兩次紀念莫薩特（Mozart）百五十週忌辰作品演奏會，這次並邀請本市著名歌唱家十六人參加演出，有極大之成功。最近該樂隊又邀請鋼琴家如WineiaTomaszewska，Susanne　Decllety等合作，演奏樂曲計有Grieg，Schumann，Vincentd'Indy等天師之作品，該樂隊因爲適合西人程度，故水準較髙，中國觀衆如無髙深修養，則頗不易了解。</p>
<p>除工部局樂隊外，本市其他正式的音樂組織，西人方面尙有Ejas，Club經常演奏地點為猶太總會，此集體內擁有本巿大部名歌唱家，其指揮爲俄人Margolinski，最近曾舉行過許勃特（Schubert）樂曲演奏會。此外在蘭心戲院經常演奏的尙有俄國輕歌劇團，俄國歌舞團等，後者最近並打入大光明，演出節目有詩人遊地獄，傾國傾城等，該團擁有樂師廿餘人，指揮爲Sloutiky，中國觀衆對其以往演出成績，均有頗佳之印像。</p>
<p>說到中國方面之音樂界正式組織，我們不禁要表示慚愧，我們很知道中國人仕亦不乏有高深修養之音樂家，然似乎總不見有任何具體之組織，直到最近，由李惟寧先生及靑年會方面才發動　個比較健全有計劃的集團，在沉寂的空氣中，總算給注射一層新的興奮劑。李惟寧先生係現任國立音專代校長，爲法國現代名音樂大師Vincentd'Indy之高足，並獲有維也納音樂院之榮譽頭銜，對藝術造詣頗深，他於本月四日發起之第一次定期音樂會中，曾親自參加鋼琴伴奏，此次係女次髙音SabinaRapp之個人獨唱會，所唱有許勃特，Hugo　wikf，Brahms．Wagner，Debussy等之小曲，李氏本人之作品如深夜·乍相見·思鄉等亦被演唱。此次除法國作家之品，用法文演唱外，其他連同李氏作品在內，均用德文唱詞，李氏之作品在含義與表現上，自難與其他名音樂家相提並論，但李氏這種倡導勇邁之精神，是很値得人佩服的。</p>
<p>由中靑會發起之音樂會，以前已經舉行過幾次，名歌唱家伍正謙等均曾登台表演，上星期六舉行之音樂會，係由馬氏三姊妹爲主幹，另由女高音陳夢蘭參加合作，陳女士此次所唱均係抒情短曲，由工部局指揮Paci鋼琴伴奏，這在上海很少人有這種榮譽的，Paci本人四十年前，在音樂院作學生時之作品「導」，亦於是日演唱，惟陳女土嗓音尙嫌狹窄，髙音階時不能應付自如，且缺乏表情。共他馬思宏君之提琴與馬思蓀女士之鋼琴獨奏，均在水準以上。是日所奏均係技術艱難之作，非有髙深修養奢絕難演奏，末曲係其長兄馬思總所作「舞曲」，此係馬氏於旅行時參照綏遠，四川民謠作成，並加多種變調，有極優美諧和之弦律，帶有濃烈東方情調，這種嘗試之作品，頗爲聽衆一致推崇讚許。</p>
<p>最近上海有一部愛好音樂之靑年，因鑒於欣賞音樂機會太少，特發起組織　唱片音樂會，這在目前之情况下，不能不算是種創舉，他們在復活節的假日裏，已舉行第一次音樂會，全部節目均係許勒特之作品，按許勃特爲一個偉大的天才，不幸三十二歲時即逝世，但留有一筆豐富的遺產，包括音樂各部們之作品，他的音樂在國人的認識裏比較熟習，故這次有着滿意的收獲，現他們定每兩週舉行一次，下星期日節目爲全部意大利大家卡羅校之作品，其他如悲多芬·莫薩特·之作品，亦定於短期間演奏，惟因創辦伊始，困難之處很多，一切尙待訴衆之支持與善意之指正。</p>
<p>關於上海音樂的刊物，可以說完全缺如，僅法文日報每星期日有音樂批評一攔，其他最近上海藝術月刊亦略作介紹，但這方面的文字尙太少，不符讀者之需求，我們很希望該刋編者能在此方面盡點力。</p>
<p>目前可預吿的，不久震旦大學將於本月二十六日舉辦一次音樂會，由郞毓秀女士等演唱，另外下月五月　日，尙有李氏第二次定期音樂會，全部係提琴節目，由工部局樂隊琴手Alder參加表演，一般愛好音樂諸君，切勿失此良機。（金川）</p>

<p>戰爭</p>
<h3>戰時美國人民生活</h3>
<p>— 王旋</p>
<p>軸心國方面所傳華盛頓最近消息，略述美國民衆生活受戰爭影響的概况，同時也可窺見美國致力於戰事的積極。</p>
<p>美國人民的生活，向稱優聞，尋歡享樂，甲於全球；可是現因發動戰爭機構，這種歡樂的生活，巳吿終止。美國各零售店舖，存底充足，人民仍能購得一切家用必需品，但在不久的將來，也許供應漸稀，實行按戶限購制。</p>
<p>美國素來盛行分期付款辦法，多種價格較髙的貨物如汽車等，都可分期繳款，以輕負担，這種辦法，現巳大事緊縮。計口授糧實行時，或不致像英國那末限制的嚴格，不過罐頭食品，不像以前的堆滿廚房，因爲罐頭漸形稀少，裝罐廠正在設法用他種物品，製成罐頭，以代馬口鐵。</p>
<p>在美國飲茶的人比較還少，然而時期延久，茶葉也許吿缺，而咖啡的計口發給，最有可能。他如香料和橄欖油的來源地，已被佔據，所以日後也將漸見稀少。此外，美國的羊毛衣衫和家用器具，也有缺乏之虞，美國本年度所產的毛織品，將悉數供軍隊應用，平民祇能購買棉毛混織品。</p>
<p>婦女穿的絲櫗，停止織造，日後祇能穿些棉織的和人造絲織的襪子；不過，那些太太小姐們最担心的，還是橡皮悉充軍用，以致無從購得有伸縮性的胸團，來保持她們苗條的嬌軀。</p>
<p>美國人民向來用慣，而認爲不可或缺的眞空除塵器，電氣氷箱，洗衣機，無綫電機和電氣焙製器等，現已不像往日那樣的可以隨意選購，必須領得證件，才能購得，因爲製造這些器具的工廠，多已改造軍械了。凡是交戰國家，飛機，坦克車，大砲和船隻，自較罐，鍋，電具等更爲重要，因此將來要獲得各種金屬品，當非易事：就是床墊和沙發椅中的彈簧，也已停止製造。</p>
<p>迄今爲止，美國所用豬鬃，須從外國輸人，戰時航運不便，所以製造刷子等物，不久將改用替代品，而毛毬等，也將减少其所含的羊毛成份。又如汽車和打字機都已停止生產，自由車產量，亦有限制。總之，國家陷於戰爭狀態，人民生活，莫不受重大影響。</p>
<p>心理</p>
<h3>什麽叫做天才？</h3>
<p>— 何凱</p>
<p>天才是能够測量的麽？實際上他是能够被測量並且也正在測量之中。</p>
<p>美國在過去數年間從事着極有趣的實騐。不久前史丹福大學的心理學敎授鐵爾曼敎授曾發表最近的報吿。——鐵爾曼敎授專心硏究天才已達十餘年之久了。</p>
<p>這些發見並不能吿訴我們怎樣去觀察小約翰或瑪麗的天才之萌芽，可是它却告訴我們，倘使他們確屬玲琍聰明的話，他們大概將變成什麽模樣。然而瑪麗或仟何女孩的成爲天才的機會是等於無；同時鐵爾曼敎授又粉碎過去一般的幻想　，認爲天才是一種怪人而只有偏向一方的才能。</p>
<p>「典型的天才並不是在脆弱的身體中的奇才」，他說。「典型的天才較一般人健康，並不將趣味偏於一方，而對其他一切愚笨不堪。他是多才多藝，能够做許多事情。他不是家中的傻瓜。典型的天才並不是從他那苦惱的身心之深處瘋狂地把天禀抽出的可憐蟲。」</p>
<p>「他是愉快的，過着幸福的結婚生活，專心於他的工作，嗜好和家庭而感到心滿意足一。</p>
<p>這就是他測量天才的結果。三十年前，他選取一千三百個在加利福尼亞最富有天禀的孩子這約佔全部人口的百分之　五，一步一步地跟隨着他們其後的發展，他能够和其中百分之九十五保持接觸，並且對全體作定期的調査。在他最近一次的調査，他發見其中有一部分已在商在界及專門職業中獲得極優越的地位，而其餘一部分則屈居微職。他把他們稱爲A和C類。</p>
<p>有一部分成功而另一部分失敗，這到底是什麽原故呢？他們所獲的機會大致是相等的</p>
<p>他發見成功者也就是眞正的天才老是保持着平穩的脾氣。他們的情緒從不陷於紛亂，而過去的紀錄證明這痕跡在他們是孩童時已能察知了。</p>
<p>他發見A類都較C類結婚較早，結婚生活較為幸福，而獲致着較佳的婚姻的調整。在A類中離婚案件較C類少三倍</p>
<p>敎授認為可悲的是，性似乎是支配天才的最重要的因素。他說，天才女子倘使不能早日結婚，她就會就着任何可謀得的職業。有鑒於此，敎授說他不願再行測量女子的天才了</p>
<h3>直布羅陀散寫</h3>
<p>— 大芬</p>
<p>直布羅陀道沉寂了許久的名字，現在叉在雷訊中出現了，如今歐洲的局勢正是出雨欲來風滿樓，這大英帝國地中海口的堡壘要佔一個什麼位置呢。</p>
<p>據說直布羅陀有很多精兵駐守，一旦有事，他們便將整犬，整日，整年的躱藏在岩石碉堡中保衛這一個重要的據點。</p>
<p>任何軍隊要想從海中登陸，奇襲直布羅陀是不可能的。岩石陡削，髙達一千二百英尺，掩護安全的守兵又皆虎視耽耽，頗無機可乘。重砲，炸彈，毒氣，飢渴或能動搖鬥志於一時，但也難說。</p>
<p>直布羅陀的堡壘是不許外人參觀的。從前還可以去參觀糜爾人戰爭時代留下的舊堡壘，如今這點機會也沒有了。外人只能想像，無緣一睹其廬山眞面。總之裏面是岩石，大砲，兵工塲，電力塲，醫院等等。說是高髙在上的大砲皆係贗鼎，以耗敵軍的砲火，眞正的大砲藏在下面岩石中。</p>
<p>但直布羅陀的抵抗力究有多大，也只能待證。而且，倘從西班牙陸上來了一支攻勢會有什麽結果，也無人敢預料。但有一事可斷言的，即直布羅陀食物與軍火的儲藏非常豐富，足供五年之用。</p>
<h3>文人的筆跡</h3>
<p>— 汎勝之</p>
<p>文人們旣然以寫文章爲其主要的職業，那麽不免終日與幾水筆與稿紙爲伍了，將感想，靈幻綴成一篇篇的文章，而一篇成名作品的原稿筆跡往往安放在博物院裏成爲無價之寳。永遠給後人一個崇高的敬仰，雖然也有不幸的，墨跡幾乎未乾便做了編輯先生的字紙　中的主顧，那是說來又是多麽扼腕的事</p>
<p>但，因之，文人們的字，即是筆跡，無論從文人本身以及出版界，書局來看，是有着如何密切的關係，從文化方面說，又有看不少歷史的價値，在西歐各國，傳物院都開一個部分展覽作家的原稿，而作家們的故居，都公開地給人觀摩，當時起居的情景，並且陳列着作家的筆跡，甚至吸水紙上反映的墨跡，都隱隱若現，像蘇聯的高爾基陳列館，瑪耶斯夫基的工作室以及如英國華斯華斯和法國都德磨坊故居，都是成了有名的勝地了。</p>
<p>文人作家們的筆跡，是使人人發生親切之感，如果你看到托爾斯泰「復活」與「戰爭與和平」的原稿，那經過刪改幾次的痕跡，像蛛絲網一般，你將感到今日能談到這樣的巨著，有如此一份精神食糧，那創作者是如何經過艱苦的耕耘，托爾斯泰的「戰爭與和平」，會經，他夫人謄抄過七遍呢！而如巴爾扎克，在很短促的時間創作小說，匆匆的付印，在印成之後，覺得不滿意又加以改正，改正了，再去付印一篇小說是常常經過好幾次的改正與改常常在鉛字旁邊留註着這作家的新筆跡，至今法國的博物館裏還保留着幾張呢。</p>
<p>從文人們的筆跡上往往發現一個奇跡，就是他們的字並不見得好，而且每每被人稱為惡筆，像莎士比亞，他的戲曲是多麽的不朽，可是在他方面，是一個有名的惡筆家，他的字比小學生寫得還難看，這或許當靈感奔放思想橫溢的時候不及顧及字跡的整齊吧，像　俄當「心血來潮」的當兒便用蘆葦製成的筆在大格的原稿紙上亂塗，有時自己也看得奠明其妙，像詩人喀萊爾的原稿過於難看，使抄寫他原稿的書記常常抄錯，而抄淸之後，又自己用紅墨水筆增刪一遍，以致原稿紙又變成一張調色板一樣的了，他給友人的信中說：「字寫得不好，我覺很羞恥，但是如果慢慢的寫，則字或許整齊，而心中想寫的意思，就會因之忘却，眞是無法可想」而雖字寫得很漂亮的盧騷也說：「思想家與創作家要是字寫得漂亮，則其橫溢的思想，反會不能盡景吐露」，這恐怕是一般作家的苦衷吧。</p>
<p>近代的作家，尤其是美國的作家，如劉易士，辛克萊等等，都染上了商業的習氣用打字機代替鋼筆墨水了，這當然省却了些出版商校對的麻煩，可是也失去了一種親切之感，不過如小托爾斯泰所說：「用打字機寫作，當自己重新讀一遍的時候，有讀他人作品而更獲得更客觀的意味，小托爾斯一泰，大約懂得這層好處而常常喜歡用打字機寫作了。</p>
<p>不過總之大多數是以墨跡爲可愛與寳貴的。在中國古代的文人，賣文大多也兼賣字，甚至以賣字　書爲主要的職業，所以在古代中國文人中是很少聞到惡筆的，而像「唐祝文周」四才子筆跡不是使後代藏書家拱若珍璧麼？但聽說新文學家中倒有不少有奇怪的筆跡的，可是因了方塊漢字，作家中也沒有聽說過有「進化」到用打字機寫作的。</p>

<h3>風雨同舟</h3>

<p>（三）客至</p>
<p>維城吿訴黃龍不能去的理由，葉二太太幫了他說話，夜深，天冷，居喪不能飲酒，全是他們的理由。黃龍道：那麽就是我把酒菜送了來，維城哥　是不能吃的。好，我去了。」黃龍提起燈籠來，向維城一晃，就像是舉手吿別。走到天井　，又走回來笑道：「維城哥，你不去，我並沒有恨你。」他聲明了這麼一句，才大踏步出去。葉二太太道：「這個人，始終是個冒失鬼，來得突兀，去得離奇。」阿興在門外笑道：「我去把他開進來，鼻子裏氣吼吼的，衝出　條白氣，活像是手電筒裏射出來的光，要生在大宋，怕就是牛皋一樣的人。」喜鵲也如骨鯁在喉不吐不快的說道：「那天早上，他不是淸早就去的嗎？一出門，就和我們家裏養的一條狗賭跑，他跑的還比狗快。」</p>
<p>又聽得叩門聲音，把家人隨便談談的話截斷。葉二太太道「黃龍一個念頭又回來請你了，你是去還是不去？如果願意去讓阿興跟了你去，怕冷，就把你爸爸那件狐皮大衣裹在身上。反正頭七過了，明天沒有會麽事。」維城道：「我不去，我不去。」阿興又把叩門的人開進來了，却不是黃龍，是一個鄕婦，手裏也是提着燈籠。葉二太太看她有些面善，只記不起是誰。那鄕婦見了葉二太太和維城，含着熱望似的說：「葉少爺，不得了了。翠珍和她舅舅鬧翻了她舅舅一些也不講理。請葉少爺快去！」維城愕然，便是其他的人也都愕然。葉二太太忙問是爲了什麼事。據那鄕婦說，她是費長河的鄰居。費長河三天兩天便和翠珍鬧起來，別人可憐翠珍，翠珍老是不肯吿訴別人。（五一）</p>

<h3>Laval to Continue Cabinet Talks; Cabinet Announces Reorganization with Laval to Become Government Leader; Darlan Remains Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces</h3>
<p>Vichy, 15th (Haitong Agency) – It is reported that after Pétain, Darlan, and Laval held two talks on Thursday, they will decide on the new government list and announce it. When the three gathered at the Garden Hotel yesterday morning, two key economic officials from the French and German authorities, namely Meisinger and Pailey-Farmer, were also present. The lineup of the new government is currently unknown. However, it is widely believed that Admiral Darlan will remain the heir apparent and Commander-in-Chief of the French Army, Navy, and Air Force, with the right to attend cabinet meetings, but will not hold a ministerial title. Laval will become the leader of the government, while Marshal Pétain will remain the chairman of the cabinet meetings, as in the past. Marshal Pétain will no longer have the power of the government leader, but Tonval will be responsible to Pétain.</p>
<p>Vichy, 15th (Haitong Agency, French Dispatch) – Secretary-General of the French Information Department, Marion, said yesterday that Laval's title will be the leader of the government. The titles of Prime Minister and Associate will be completely abolished. Laval will be responsible to the Head of State. Darlan will remain the heir to the Head of State, with the title of Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, relinquishing the title of Minister, and will be able to attend all cabinet meetings. From now on, Pétain will only serve as Head of State, and the chairmanship of the cabinet meetings may be concurrently held by Laval.</p>
<p>Vichy, 15th (Haitong Agency) – The French government today officially announced to the French people the results of the discussions among Pétain, Darlan, and Laval. Well-informed sources pointed out that the cooperation between Pétain and Laval follows the Montoire policy, meaning close cooperation between Germany and France. Laval's appointment to an important position does not imply a complete change in the basic policies of domestic and foreign affairs. Laval has always understood France's true interests and can seek France's true interests in times of crisis, so Pétain invited him to come out.</p>
<p>Geneva, 14th (Havas Agency) – According to political figures here, once the talks being conducted by the French authorities are concluded, a new government can be formed in the country. It is expected that former Prime Minister Laval will serve as Prime Minister. From the Vichy communiqué stating that the French cabinet will establish a new government according to new principles, it can be seen that major changes will occur in the French political situation, not only personnel changes, but also changes in the form of government. Up to now, Head of State Pétain also concurrently serves as Chairman of the Council of State. In the future new government, the powers of the Head of State will still be held by one person and will never change. However, the powers of the Head of Government, that is, the Prime Minister, will be exercised by a person selected by the Head of State from among the cabinet members. It is expected that General Pétain will remain the Head of State, and former Prime Minister Laval will serve as Prime Minister, exercising his powers under the leadership of Head of State Pétain. As for Lieutenant General Darlan, the Associate of the Cabinet, according to the fundamental law, he will remain the heir to Head of State Pétain and will participate in cabinet meetings as the Supreme Commander of the Navy, Army, and Air Force. Based on this, although there will not be major changes in the fundamental organization of the government, there will be slight modifications in the organization of governance. In addition, there are various speculations about the selection of other cabinet members, and there is still no definitive news. However, political figures here expect the French government to officially announce the reorganization of the cabinet on March 16.</p>
<h3>News of the French Cabinet Reorganization Draws Attention from Britain and the United States; Rumors of France Possibly Declaring War on Britain</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 15th (Haitong Agency) – According to sources from London, the reorganization of the French government has drawn attention from London. This new development is considered another defeat for the British and American alliance. London newspapers also discuss the exchange of opinions between London and Washington, so the United States may exert pressure on Vichy. Because rumors of the French government's reorganization circulated in London as early as Monday evening, there were already comments on this matter in yesterday's morning papers. The foreign affairs correspondent of the "Daily Mail" stated that the French fleet still has considerable strength, and the French army stationed in North Africa is also very strong, so France may declare war on Britain.</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Haitong Agency) – The German Foreign Ministry refused to comment last night on the Vichy communiqué stating that Marshal Pétain, Admiral Darlan, and Laval had decided to form a new French government, because it had not yet received information on this matter.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Haitong Agency, New York Dispatch) – The French communiqué stating that French Head of State General Pétain, Deputy Prime Minister Darlan, and former Prime Minister Laval have decided to establish a government based on new principles has drawn the attention of Americans. Within minutes of this news reaching New York, all American radio reporters declared that Laval's return to the cabinet was a consequence of the United States intensifying its policy of confrontation. Political circles do not believe that Washington will not issue an official statement on this matter in the near future. However, Undersecretary of State Welles will request the French Ambassador to the United States, Henry Haye, to explain the situation. Some people even believe that after Laval joins the cabinet, it may lead to the United States recalling its ambassador to Vichy, Leahy.</p>
<h3>US Ambassador to France to Be Recalled; US Newspapers Advocate Severing Ties with France</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 15th (Allied News Agency) – Australian broadcasts received here state that the US Ambassador to Vichy, Leahy, will be recalled to Washington to consult with the US government.</p>
<p>Washington, 14th (Reuters Agency) – Well-informed sources expect that the US Ambassador to Vichy, Leahy, will be recalled. Senior US government officials frankly admit that it is necessary for Vichy to review the relationship between the United States and Vichy. However, it is pointed out that Leahy's recall does not mean breaking off diplomatic relations. Some people here predict that the United States will completely sever ties with Vichy and provide full support to the Free French. However, well-informed sources advise all parties not to draw conclusions prematurely.</p>
<p>Washington, 15th (Reuters Agency) – The Washington Post today published an article criticizing Laval's return to power in Vichy, calling on the United States to recognize the de Gaulle faction as the "true government of true France." Laval's new position is now the subject of discussion in diplomatic circles. Many people feel that the hope of Vichy cooperating more closely with Germany has finally been shattered, and the United States' continued policy of sympathy towards Vichy is also useless, so the time for a "clear break" has now arrived. At the same time, as of this evening, the US State Department has not received any information from Vichy regarding the French cabinet reorganization. However, recalling the US government's past uncoordinated attitude towards Tonval, it is expected that Vichy will adopt a policy of seeking isolation. The rejection of the memorandum submitted by Washington yesterday regarding the US policy towards the Free French authorities is a clear indication. It is questionable whether US officials still trust Vichy's repeated assurances of maintaining neutrality and faithfully abiding by the terms of the armistice. The recent developments in Franco-American relations have shocked those who are usually well-informed, as they all believed that as long as Darlan was in the French government, he would never allow Laval to make a comeback.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Silent Attitude</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Haitong Agency, Washington Dispatch) – President Roosevelt adopted a silent attitude at yesterday's intelligence meeting when a reporter asked about Laval's return to the French cabinet, saying only that comments could be sought from the State Department.</p>
<p>Washington, 15th (Reuters Agency) – As of late last night, the State Department had not received any news regarding the Vichy cabinet changes. Officials are very skeptical about whether the statements repeatedly announced by Vichy in the past regarding its neutral policy and its promise to faithfully fulfill the provisions of the armistice agreement can be trusted. Although it is known that the Vichy government may take actions under the current circumstances that will force the United States to sever ties with Vichy, it is still believed here that the United States does not intend to take the initiative to break off relations with Vichy. Well-informed sources originally believed that Laval would not be in power as long as Darlan was in office. Therefore, well-informed sources were greatly shocked after learning the news of Laval's return to power. It is heard that once the United States breaks off relations with Vichy, some of the Vichy personnel in the United States still intend to stay in the United States.</p>
<h3>US Protest Note Rejected by Vichy; US House of Representatives Seeks to Occupy French Territories and Cooperate Closely with the de Gaulle Faction</h3>
<p>Vichy, 14th (Havas Agency) – Regarding the US government's establishment of a consulate general in Brazzaville, the center of the de Gaulle faction in French Equatorial Africa, the French government had protested to the US authorities. The US reply has also been delivered. The French government therefore instructed its ambassador to the United States, Henry Haye, today to declare to the United States that the French government found it difficult to accept this reply. Regarding this matter, the French semi-official side recently issued a statement stating, "Regarding the US government's establishment of a consulate general in Brazzaville, after we protested to the United States, our ambassador to the United States, Henry Haye, received a reply from the US State Department on April 13 and immediately forwarded it to the government. After reviewing the content of this reply, not only are the words arrogant, but its purpose is to reduce the value of the patriotic activities of our loyal citizens. Our government immediately instructed Ambassador Henry Haye to notify the US Secretary of State, informing him that the French government found it difficult to accept this reply. The French people know how to love their country, and there is no need for outsiders to teach them. In addition, there is one point that the French government cannot but solemnly declare, that is, the US government's immediate publication of this reply, in violation of diplomatic norms, clearly shows that it contains propaganda purposes. As for the questions raised in the French note, the American reply does not contain a single word of response."</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Haitong Agency) – Yesterday, the German Foreign Ministry commented on the US reply to the French government's protest against the US establishment of a consulate in Brazzaville, French Equatorial Africa, stating that US Undersecretary of State Welles stated in his reply that the US move was for the benefit of the French. However, when Welles toured Europe in 1940, he fully revealed his lack of understanding of European events. Welles still believes that the fate of the French nation can be controlled by Washington.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 15th (Haitong Agency) – According to news from Washington, the US House of Representatives has requested the government to occupy French territories because they occupy an important strategic position for the United States. The House of Representatives also requested the government to cooperate closely with the de Gaulle faction. It is believed that the House's attitude is a direct result of the French government's reorganization.</p>
<h3>US Dispatches One Hundred Small Warships to Patrol the Atlantic Coast</h3>
<p>Boston, 15th (Havas Agency) – Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox announced to the press today that the government has added one hundred small warships to strengthen the strength of the Atlantic coast patrol team.</p>
<p>Washington, 14th (Havas Agency) – It was learned that a British ship, which was previously sunk by a torpedo off the US Atlantic coast, and all 299 people on board, arrived safely in a port in the eastern United States today. They were refugees from the Far East war zone, including 37 women and 24 children. No one on board died after the accident, but a member of the Executive Committee of Johor District in the United Kingdom was injured.</p>
<p>More US Merchant Ships Sunk</p>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Haitong Agency, Washington Dispatch) – The US Navy Department in Washington announced last night that two American cargo ships were lost off the American coast in the Atlantic, one of which was a medium-sized cargo ship, and the other was a small cargo ship.</p>
<p>Washington, 14th (Havas Agency) – The Navy Department announced that another merchant ship of ordinary tonnage was sunk by a submarine off the American coast in the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 15th (Haitong Agency) – According to yesterday's announcement in the capital of Brazil, the US oil tanker "McKay" (7,452 tons), the British cargo ship "Empire", and the Norwegian ship "Balkis" have all been sunk by torpedoes.</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Haitong Agency) – Responsible parties in Berlin estimate that after German submarines operated off the American coast, a total of 88 oil tankers belonging to Britain and the United States were lost, with a total tonnage of 713,120 tons. In addition to the oil tankers sunk, more than 1,070,000 tons of gasoline were lost.</p>
<h3>Spain and Portugal Prepare to Hold a Meeting</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Haitong Agency) – Preparations for the Spanish-Portuguese meeting to be held in Bordeaux in June this year are progressing smoothly. Several requests made by Spanish and Portuguese scientists have been adopted. Lisbon expects that the meeting will not only have important economic gains, but also increase cultural relations with Latin America.</p>

Later, Mr. Zhang's family members and relatives in his hometown advocated returning the coffin to Shaanxi for burial and requested the approval of the preparation committee. The committee has resolved to accept the opinions of Mr. Zhang's family members and relatives and jointly responsible for the preparation with Xi'an, in order to meet the original intention of initiating the public burial. Mr. Zhang's coffin is scheduled to depart from Chongqing on the 16th at noon.

<h3>India Special Issue: Two Races and Their Religions</h3>
<p>Shanghai people call Indians "Indian Blackies," which is really quite clever. Being clever doesn't necessarily mean being correct. The reason it's said to be clever is because it could be considered right, or it could be considered wrong. What's the mystery in all this? Readers, don't be impatient; listen as I slowly explain it to you.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that India is an ancient country. But just how ancient is it? It's enough to make people gasp. According to anthropological scholars, the Indian continent is the birthplace of humanity! Based on the theory of Professor A. H. Keane, the earliest human forms were most similar to today's Black people, and their region of origin was the so-called India-Australia region, which was a continent connecting Australia and Africa from a certain point in India. Later, when the continent sank and was separated by the Indian Ocean, humans retreated westward into Africa, advanced northeastward into India and the Malay Archipelago, and retreated southward into Australia. This is how humans spread out. Therefore, the Black people living in Africa and India, called Negritos, are the most primitive and infantile of the Black race. It is said that the Mincopie tribe, a kind of short-statured aborigines on the Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal, is a representative of the original Black people. According to this, wouldn't the earliest race in India be the truly authentic, original "Blackies"? So it's not entirely unreasonable for Shanghai people to call Indians "Indian Blackies." However, the only real "Blackies" are these original Indian Black people; the rest are not, and some are even "White Coal." The race that is currently most influential in India and represents it is the "White Coal," the Indo-Aryan race, which is the same as Europeans.</p>
<p>The "Blackies" were the original pioneers who opened up India. Next to go to India were the Dravidians. They passed through Punjab and entered central India, putting pressure on the original inhabitants and forcing them to move to southern India. The descendants of these Dravidians are the current Tamil, Telugu, and Kannada peoples, etc. The next to migrate to India were the Indo-Aryan people, who were tall and fair-skinned like Europeans. They left their original homeland in Central Asia, crossed the Hindu Kush mountains, and settled in northwestern India. The word "Aryan," when translated into Sanskrit, is usually translated as "holy," meaning noble. Originally, because these people were tall, fair-skinned, intelligent, and brave, and more superior to the earlier inhabitants of India, they inevitably became self-important. The Aryan people first settled in the Punjab region, engaged in animal husbandry, and gradually expanded their power to the southeast, entering the Ganges River basin. They drove the original Dravidian people to the south and gradually gained power, becoming the main body of the Indian people, which remains unchanged to this day. Among the Indians in Shanghai, there may be descendants of the Negritos, but they are ultimately mostly descendants of the Aryans, in which case calling Indians "Blackies" is incorrect.</p>
<p>Although the Indo-Aryans became the representative race of India, many other races migrated to India in large groups after them. From the West came the Greeks of Bactria, who crossed the Hindu Kush mountains and settled in the Gandhara and Punjab regions. Also, due to transportation and political relations, the Persians of the west also had some interactions with India. From the East came the Yuezhi and Saka peoples, who originally lived in western China. The Yuezhi people produced a king, Kanishka, who conquered the northern half of India and established the great Kushan dynasty, which was a prominent power at home and abroad. This is a major event in Indian history. However, these races were not able to sweep across the entire India like the Aryans; their invasions were limited to northwestern India. There were also Mongoloid peoples who invaded India from the northeastern route of the Himalayas. It is said that the current Bengalis are descendants of Mongoloids and Dravidians. As for going to India by sea, that was a relatively late development. The Jews and Arabs came relatively later, and it was not until the end of the fifteenth century that Europeans landed in India, followed by a continuous stream, even turning India into a dependency of Britain.</p>
<p>Today, India has a population of about 330 to 340 million, composed of many races and also many complex mixed races. Therefore, in terms of the national content that makes up the country, whether viewed from a racial or historical perspective, the country of India is extremely complex, which naturally has a direct impact on the overall culture and social organization, making them also complex. However, the center of the Indian nation, the main body of the Indian national society, is neither the earliest Black people nor the later Greeks, Persians, Arabs, Yuezhi, Saka, etc., but the Indo-Aryan people. Therefore, when discussing all issues related to India, as long as one grasps the Aryans, one grasps the core of the racial aspect of India.</p>
<p>Indian people, when they meet strangers, do not ask where you are from but ask what religion you belong to. This shows the deep relationship between India and religion. The most important caste system in Indian society, although said to have existed since the creation of the world, is actually inseparable from religious meaning. The earliest Brahmanical teachings of India claim that since the ancient Vedic period, although all are human, the Brahmins are said to have been born from the head of Brahma, the Kshatriyas from the shoulders of Brahma, the Vaishyas and Shudras from the legs and feet of Brahma. This is the origin of the myth of the four castes. The first caste, the Brahmins, is the priestly class that presides over sacrifices, wielding real power in religious matters. People of other castes sometimes even regard them as deities. The second caste, the Kshatriyas, is the class of kings and general aristocratic families who hold national power. They hold full political power and engage in military affairs, with the protection of the country and the people as their duty. The third caste, the Vaishyas, is the commoner class engaged in agricultural, industrial, and commercial production, and they have the obligation to pay taxes to the state. The fourth caste, the Shudras, is the slave class, the lowest of the four castes, whose only occupation is to serve the three upper castes with their labor. The Brahmins believe that the division of these four castes is divinely ordained and cannot be changed. If it is disrupted, it would be rebelling against God's decree and causing social chaos. Although there were only these four castes at the beginning, they became more and more distinct and numerous, so that now there are as many as 2,300 or 2,400 castes in India!</p>
<p>In the fifth century BC, a new religion suddenly emerged from the Indo-Aryan people, who were swept by Brahmanism. This religion opposed the four-caste system and advocated breaking down classes. It was Buddhism, founded by Shakyamuni. Buddhism is the highest authority in thought and religion, and no further explanation is needed. However, this Buddhism, which originated in India, is now very weak in its place of origin, with only a little influence remaining in the northeastern border area of Tibet and southern Ceylon. Buddhism in India was squeezed out by Hinduism. Hinduism, simply put, is a new type of Brahmanism that emerged in the eighth century AD. They did not have the high intelligence and philosophy of the original Brahmins, and they sacrificed to many gods, said to be 330 million deities! In the fifteenth century, they also incorporated Islamic doctrines. To cater to the general populace, they even worshiped deities that represent the worship of reproductive organs. Although Hinduism is called a return to Brahmanism, it is actually a religious reversal. But Hinduism is precisely the religion welcomed by the Indian people. Thus, in India, it drove Buddhism out of the country and still holds the greatest religious power in India. According to German statistics on Indian religions, it is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(Hinduism accounts for 68.5% of the total Indian population. Islam accounts for 12.7% of the total Indian population. Buddhism accounts for 4% of the total Indian population. Animism accounts for 3% of the total Indian population. Sikhism accounts for 1% of the total Indian population. Christianity accounts for 1.5% of the total Indian population. Other accounts for 0.3% of the total Indian population.)</p>
<p>From the above table, one can generally see how enormous the power of Hinduism is. The central and southern parts of the Indian peninsula are almost entirely within the sphere of Hinduism's influence. The northwestern Punjab and Sindh are havens for Muslims, but there are also separate Muslim areas in the lower reaches of Bengal. As for Sikhism, it is within the borders of Punjab, and animism is mixed in the middle of Hinduism on the peninsula.</p>
<p>Religion in India is also very relevant to its self-government issues. According to Indian nationalists, whether Hindu or Muslim, they advocate that religious differences should be permanent political divisions, which would further strengthen self-government.</p>

<p>Canberra, 14th (Reuters) - The Australian cabinet today underwent a partial reorganization. Prime Minister Curtin will concurrently hold the position of Minister of Defense and be responsible for liaison between the government and General MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific. At the same time, Prime Minister Curtin will also be responsible for liaison between the Federal Government and the Australian representatives in the British War Cabinet and the Pacific War Council.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 14th (Allied News Agency) - According to a Reuters dispatch from Canberra, the Australian government has decided to establish a new Ministry of Defense. Prime Minister Curtin has taken office today, concurrently holding the position of Minister of Defense. The purpose of establishing the new Ministry of Defense is to facilitate liaison between MacArthur's anti-Axis Allied forces and the Australian government. In the future, high-level policies concerning the defense of Australia will be proposed by Curtin to the Australian War Cabinet. Prime Minister Curtin will also personally liaise with Australian representatives attending the London War Cabinet and the Washington Pacific Conference, handling external negotiations.</p>
<p>MacArthur's Authority Questioned</p>
<p>Melbourne, 15th (Reuters) - A spokesman for the U.S. General Headquarters stated today that General MacArthur has not yet officially taken office as Supreme Commander of the Southwest Pacific, and currently only commands U.S. forces in the Far East, while his headquarters has been moved to Australia. President Roosevelt, while receiving reporters in Washington, emphasized that MacArthur commands the sea, land, and air forces of the Allied nations in the Southwest Pacific theater, but President Roosevelt declined to provide details about the boundaries of this theater. The Army spokesman could not provide further clarification, only stating that MacArthur is in close consultation with the Australian Army and government to formulate plans, while awaiting his official assumption of the position of Supreme Commander.</p>
<p>Canberra, 15th (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Curtin stated this afternoon at a reception for reporters that the Australian government considers General MacArthur to be the Supreme Commander of all Allied forces in the Southwest Pacific, with the authority to take any steps he deems appropriate. Curtin also stated that the Australian cabinet selected a new Australian ambassador to the United States during today's meeting, but will not announce the name of the new ambassador until an agreement is reached with the U.S. government.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (News Agency) - President Roosevelt refused to clarify the authority of General MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific, during a press conference at the White House yesterday. It remains unclear to outsiders whether the New Zealand and Hawaiian U.S. forces are under MacArthur's command. However, Roosevelt only replied that MacArthur can command the land, sea, and air forces of the Allied nations in the Southwest Pacific.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 15th (Haitong News Agency) - The "New York Daily News" has called for the appointment of General MacArthur as the U.S. Secretary of War, as MacArthur's authority does not include the forces of New Zealand, and it is not clearly stipulated whether Admiral Nimitz of Hawaii is under his command. Therefore, MacArthur should be given the opportunity to fully develop his military talents for Washington to win this war. The current Secretary of War, Stimson, is an old officer whose prestige cannot be compared with MacArthur. In addition, the appointment of MacArthur as Secretary of War would increase the American people's determination to fight.</p>

<h3>British Chancellor of the Exchequer Reads New Budget in the House of Commons: Total Expenditure Increases by 500 Million Pounds; Major Increase in Various Consumption Taxes</h3>
<p>London, 15th (Reuters) - Chancellor of the Exchequer Wood presented the budget for 1942-43 in the House of Commons yesterday. The total expenditure is approximately £5,286,000,000, an increase of £510,000,000 over the previous year. Tax revenues are expected to exceed £6,500,000,000. The shortfall will be mainly filled by increasing taxes on tobacco, alcohol, and entertainment. Luxury goods such as silk fabrics, leather coats, hair curlers, jewelry, various musical instruments (except radios), and cosmetics will also see a doubling of the purchase tax, which will be equal to two-thirds of the wholesale price. Taxes on tobacco and alcohol will increase by one-third. It is estimated that Britain's beer consumption last year totaled approximately £330,000,000. This beer tax will increase by an average of one penny per pint. Various alcohol taxes will increase by one shilling and eight pence per bottle. Taxes on light wines were originally eight shillings per gallon for foreign goods and six shillings per gallon for domestic goods; each will increase by six shillings. Taxes on fortified wines or sweet wines were originally sixteen shillings per gallon for foreign goods and twelve shillings per gallon for domestic goods; each will increase by twelve shillings. The new tax rules will be implemented starting Wednesday. They are expected to generate £20,000,000 within the year. After the increase in tobacco tax, a pack of ten cigarettes originally selling for nine pence will increase to one shilling. Annual tobacco consumption totals approximately £340,000,000. National cinema ticket revenue is estimated at £1,400,000,000 annually. Entertainment tax will be doubled for tickets priced above seven pence. For example, a ticket priced at nine pence will see the entertainment tax increase to two and a half pence. Ringside seats at boxing matches cost 42 shillings per seat, and the entertainment tax will increase to 21 shillings and two pence. In this way, alcohol taxes can increase by £15,000,000, tobacco taxes can increase by £90,000,000, entertainment taxes can increase by £158,000,000, and luxury goods taxes can increase by £10,000,000. However, tobacco for the wounded and soldiers will still be priced at the original price. As for income taxes, there will be no reduction, but wage income taxes will be adjusted. Before the war, wage income taxes were paid by 1,000,000 people, totaling £25,000,000. In the last fiscal year, 5,500,000 people paid taxes totaling £125,000,000. Sir Kingsley Wood read the budget for 137 minutes. After reading, the entire House applauded him.</p>
<p>London, 15th (Havas) - Chancellor of the Exchequer Wood stated in the House of Commons yesterday when presenting the budget that, as of February this year, the aid provided by the United States to the Allied countries under the Lend-Lease Act has totaled approximately 26 billion U.S. dollars.</p>
<h3>U.S. Congress Prepares to Introduce Bills to Address Inflation</h3>
<p>Washington, 14th (Havas) - The United States is currently facing the crisis of inflation. Congress is preparing to introduce several bills to address the issue. However, most financial experts are not yet fully aware of the actual situation of increased currency issuance and rising prices. Since the United States entered the war, the cost of living has increased by 15%. It is expected to increase by at least 23% by the end of this year. In this case, the government budget will be turbulent, and the war preparation production plan will be overturned. The U.S. government has allocated more than 100 billion in military spending. If prices continue to rise, this amount will be insufficient. The House Appropriations Committee has received several proposals to prevent inflation. In summary, the proposed measures are approximately fivefold: 1. Implement tax increases; 2. Control wages; 3. Limit wartime profits; 4. Restrict lending facilities; 5. Expand price controls. Let's discuss them separately. First, regarding the tax increase, there are many difficulties. Since the beginning of the war, the burden on U.S. taxpayers has already been very heavy. The total tax revenue for this year is estimated to be approximately 125 billion. Some government officials plan to increase it by another 80 billion, but others still consider it insufficient. It is said that to have a good forecast, the tax revenue item should be listed as 250 billion. In addition to increasing taxes, the government also plans to implement compulsory savings, requiring taxpayers to purchase national defense bonds based on their salaries, which will be repaid after the war. However, this has not been fully decided. Second, regarding the control of wages, although this measure is an effective way to prevent the high cost of living, it will inevitably cause social problems. Recently, union leaders have agreed to abolish double pay for overtime work. To compensate for the sacrifices of the working class, the government may enact laws to stipulate the maximum salary for all classes across the country. According to sources in the transportation sector, based on this principle, U.S. citizens should not earn more than 50,000 per year during the war. If implemented, it would be a major way to appease dissatisfaction in the labor community. Third, regarding the limitation of wartime profits, this bill is currently under discussion in Congress. The maximum limit is said to be set at 6%. Some government officials even want to order military factories to return previous excess profits to the government. Whether this can be realized remains to be seen. Fourth, regarding the restriction of lending, the first step is to prohibit "installment payment" transactions. This method is very common in the United States, but according to economists, it is a major cause of the increased cost of living in the United States. Fifth, regarding price controls, it is generally supported by the public and is currently being studied by President Roosevelt himself. Recommendations are expected to be submitted to Congress soon. Henderson, Director of the U.S. Office of Price Administration, has had the power to "freeze" the prices of certain goods since the outbreak of the war. In the future, this power may be extended to many more commodities.</p>
<h3>First Blackout Implemented in Washington, D.C.</h3>
<p>Washington, 15th (Reuters) - Washington, D.C., implemented its first citywide blackout last night, giving 75,000 police officers, firefighters, and civil defense personnel their first large-scale test. Passengers on buses and streetcars all left the vehicles and took shelter in nearby buildings.</p>
<h3>East Line Ice and Snow Thaw, Battlefield Muddy, Offense and Defense in a Stalemated State, Intense Fighting Still Occurring Where Roads Are Firm</h3>
<p>Berlin, April 15th, Huitong News Agency: Today's German military report stated that the enemy's offensive on the Eastern Front has weakened compared to before. Only a few areas with slightly stronger forces were repelled. Our army's counterattacks were victorious. German artillery bombarded facilities in Leningrad, with factories being a primary target. The sound of explosions was loud, and the fire illuminated the sky. German fighter squadrons bombarded port facilities and airfields in Sevastopol.</p>
<p>Berlin, April 15th, Huitong News Agency: The ice and snow on the Eastern Front have begun to thaw, and the vast battlefield is nothing but a muddy swamp. Therefore, no large-scale battles have occurred in recent days. The Soviet army's offensive activities have also sharply decreased, with only more intense battles unfolding where the roads are relatively firm, such as in the areas west of Moscow, including Yukhnov and Medyn. The Soviet army repeatedly attacked German positions, but all were repelled by the German army. In several northern areas, Soviet troops also launched attacks, briefly penetrating the German lines, but were driven out by German counterattacks. The southern section of the Eastern Front is relatively quiet, with nothing worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Berlin, April 14th, Havas: The German News Agency recently issued a message stating that the weather on the Eastern Front is harsh, affecting both the offensive and defensive sides. In addition, as the spring season arrives, the autumn thaw is occurring, roads are muddy, and highways are unusable. Soldiers work day and night to maintain important transportation. Despite the difficulties, the German army is still able to maintain normal connections, thanks to the efforts of special transportation teams. In short, due to the bad weather on the Eastern Front, the fighting has stopped and is in a state of stalemate.</p>
<p>Berlin, April 14th, Havas: The German News Agency recently announced that in recent days, the Red Army has repeatedly attacked the German division's positions in the Yukhnov area. On April 12th, under the cover of artillery fire, the Red Army launched as many as fourteen successive attacks, all of which failed.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, April 14th, Havas: This agency's special correspondent reports that neutral observers believe that the situation on the German-Soviet front line is becoming increasingly chaotic, especially in the Donets River basin. The battle for Bryansk on the Desna River is currently raging. Although the Red Army claims to have safely crossed the river, the city is already encircled. The German army claims that the enemy has been blocked on the east bank of the river, suffering heavy losses and retreating. Furthermore, regarding the Kharkov front, the situation is also very ambiguous. Although the Red Army claims to have recaptured Belgorod, the official communique has not confirmed this claim. The Red Army today still claims to have broken through the German lines between Belgorod and Kharkov, directly attacking the vicinity of Zachepylivka, a town 25 miles west of Kharkov. If this is true, then the railway lines from Kharkov to the north and northwest have likely been cut off.</p>
<p>Berlin, April 15th, Huitong News Agency: The German High Command announced yesterday afternoon that German fighter squadrons heavily attacked a certain port on the Black Sea coast on Monday. Although Soviet aircraft attempted to intercept them, the German aircraft still reached the target and dropped bombs like rain on the port facilities, causing several large fires. A 5,000-ton Soviet oil tanker also caught fire after being hit.</p>
<h3>US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Presents Credentials, Japanese Envoy Meets with Soviet Foreign Minister, First Dutch Minister Arrives in Australia</h3>
<p>Moscow, April 15th, Reuters: The new US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Admiral Standley, presented his credentials to the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet, Kalinin, yesterday.</p>
<p>Moscow, April 14th, Allied Press: The new Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sato, met with the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, for one hour at 5:00 PM today. The content of the meeting was not announced.</p>
<p>Batavia, April 15th, Reuters: The first Dutch Minister to the Commonwealth of Australia, Eeltsen, has arrived here.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Issues Military Bonds, Divided into Lottery and Interest-Bearing Types, Totaling 100 Billion Rubles</h3>
<p>Moscow, April 15th: To obtain additional funds for conducting the war, the Soviet People's Commissariat has decided to issue 100 billion rubles in national military bonds, with a term of twenty years. The 1942 national military bonds are divided into two types: lottery bonds and interest-bearing bonds. The tickets for the lottery bonds are repaid with all the income from the lottery. The tickets for the interest-bearing bonds pay interest on schedule. Over the twenty years, the lottery bonds will be drawn forty times, that is, twice a year.</p>
<h3>Cripps Arrives in Cairo Yesterday</h3>
<p>Cairo, April 15th, Reuters: Sir Stafford Cripps arrived here today and is staying at the British Embassy in Egypt.</p>
<p>Berlin, April 15th, Huitong News Agency: The German Foreign Ministry believes that Cripps' failure in India is a symbol of the end of the British era. If Cripps does not succeed in his mission, it will be a major blow to the justice of the Axis powers' war. The simplicity of the British is astounding; they still believe that India can be deceived as easily as it was during the First World War. However, Britain's second attempt has now proven its failure. Britain boasted that "India is the heart of the British Empire," but today India has become a wart of the British Empire. Although India has not yet reached its goal, it is moving towards it. Therefore, the calls of Bose, the leader of the Indian National Congress, will attract more attention than in the past.</p>
<p>Bose Broadcasts in Germany</p>
<p>Berlin, April 15th, Havas: Prominent Indian leader Bose recently delivered a radio address here, stating that India is about to regain its freedom. He briefly said that the situation in the Far Eastern war is clear at a glance, that is, Britain is about to surrender. The claim of the British Empire's naval superiority is nothing more than a myth. The Japanese navy's victory in the Indian Ocean has achieved an irresistible advantage. Every patriotic person should seize the opportunity to fight for India's freedom and contact the enemies of British imperialism. Germany, Italy, and Japan are our friendly nations. Indian independence is not far off.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Military Delegation Arrives in Washington</h3>

<h3>Marshall Advocates Launching a Blitzkrieg Offensive in Europe, American Military Strategist Publishes Article Discussing Invasion Locations</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, April 14th, Havas: The Berlin correspondent of the Geneva Daily News reports, according to sources on the German-Swiss border, that US Army Chief of Staff General Marshall, currently in London, is strongly urging the British General Staff to accept President Roosevelt's plan for an immediate invasion of continental Europe. The US believes that Germany has stationed only a small number of troops in Western Europe and that the people in the occupied areas are mostly inclined towards the Allied powers. British troops and the American Expeditionary Force can easily achieve success by launching a blitzkrieg offensive from the British mainland. Therefore, the US believes that this military action, even if it cannot be launched immediately, should be implemented as soon as possible. However, the German side is well aware of this plan and does not consider it to be a serious threat. They also do not believe that Britain will accept it, as the British know that implementing the US plan would only result in heavy sacrifices. For Germany, its main task is on the Eastern Front, and it will continue to devote its efforts to it and will not allow others to interfere.</p>
<p>Lisbon, April 15th, Huitong News Agency: A military commentator for the New York National Broadcasting Company published an article in the American Observer magazine discussing the possibility of an Allied invasion of continental Europe. He stated that to defeat Germany, an invasion of the mainland is unavoidable. After conducting a detailed review of the military prerequisites for this plan, he also raised the issue of the location for implementing this plan. In addition to Norway and Brittany, he also mentioned neutral Spain. The Middle East is also within the plan, but Turkey's participation in the war is an important factor. Berlin, April 14th, Havas: According to official information received here, the Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Maisky, recently delivered a note from his government to the British and American governments, requesting that those countries provide prompt and full assistance to the Soviet Union and urging the British and American authorities to further understand the Soviet Union's actual situation and its military achievements. It stated that the Soviet Union's internal affairs have often been deliberately distorted by the outside world in the past twenty years, and that because of these inaccurate rumors, the Soviet Union has been isolated in the world, especially from Britain. Walls of misunderstanding and suspicion have surrounded us. Full cooperation between the Soviet Union and the Anglo-Saxons during and after the war cannot succeed unless this wall is first destroyed. German officials commented on this note, stating that the Soviet authorities are trying to quickly establish a spring offensive plan, and their increasing nervousness can be seen in this note. At this point, the Soviet Union has realized its isolation and helplessness. British Prime Minister Churchill's speech in the House of Commons yesterday, stating that Britain does not intend to take any futile military actions, will only increase the Soviet Union's anxiety.</p>
<h3>Marshall and Others Call on the British King Yesterday and Meet with the Polish Commander-in-Chief</h3>
<p>Several, April 15th, Reuters: US Army Chief of Staff General Marshall and Hopkins had lunch with the British King at Buckingham Palace today.</p>
<p>London, April 15th, Reuters: US Army Chief of Staff General Marshall had a long talk today with Polish Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief General Sikorski. In addition to discussing the status of the Polish army in Britain, the East, and the Soviet Union, they also discussed the military situation in Europe, especially in the Soviet Union. Hopkins also met with the Turkish Ambassador to Britain, Orbay. Harriman, who is responsible for receiving supplies in Britain, also dined with Sikorski.</p>
<h3>Swedish Centenarian Passes Away</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, April 15th, Huitong News Agency: Swedish centenarian Wan Lanlefu passed away in Stockholm yesterday at the age of 106. He was born in 1835 and was a merchant by trade.</p>

<h3>Ceylon Island's Posture Under Dense War Clouds</h3>
<p>Judging from the war news on the newspapers, unless there are local offensive and defensive battles on the Bataan Peninsula of Luzon Island in the Pacific War, land military operations seem to have temporarily come to a halt; generally, it is speculated that the future direction of the Japanese army's actions will be India and Australia. The implementation of various precautions in India and Australia shows the urgency of the situation.</p>
<p>On the Australian side, the Japanese army has already landed on New Guinea Island north of the Australian mainland, aiming to capture Port Moresby, so that it can be used as a base to attack Australia from nearby. Therefore, New Guinea can be said to be the outpost of Australia, and its gains and losses have a great impact on Australia itself. On the Indian side, there is also an outpost similar to New Guinea for Australia, which is Ceylon Island. Ceylon Island and the Indian continent are only separated by the Palk Strait, just as New Guinea and Australia are only separated by the Torres Strait. Ceylon Island is now a direct colony of the British Empire, and its capital Colombo has recently been bombed for the first time by Japanese naval aircraft. Judging from past examples, air raids are often the prelude to military attacks, so Ceylon Island has attracted the world's attention in recent days.</p>
<p>Considering the topography of Ceylon Island, it is roughly similar to a pear, with the pear tip facing north. The total area of the island is 25,332 square miles, which is slightly smaller than two-thirds of Zhejiang Province in China. The north is separated from India by the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk Strait. The temperature on the island varies with the altitude. The highest places are Pidurutalagala (8,296 feet) and Adam's Peak (7,352 feet). However, as a whole, although Ceylon Island is located in the tropics, the climate, except in the low-lying areas, does not hinder health. The weather is coolest in December and January, and hottest in April and May.</p>
<p>Ceylon Island had various names in ancient times, such as the ancient Greeks and Romans called it Taprobane. Later, Western and Eastern people wrote books and called it Serendib, Sirindul, and Zeylan, etc. The earliest inhabitants of Ceylon Island were perhaps the ancestors of the Vedda people, a primitive small tribe who lived by hunting and currently reside in the eastern forests. People have found ancient stone tools in the caves inhabited by the Vedda people, indicating that they have lived on the island for an unknown number of years.</p>
<p>The famous ancient Indian epic "Ramayana" contains the story of the ancient Indian hero Rama and his followers conquering part of Ceylon Island and occupying the capital of Ceylon Island's king, Ravana. Whether this story is based on facts is unknown, but if it happened, the occupation did not last long. The reliable history of Ceylon Island that people can trace back to begins in 543 BC, when Vijaya, the founder of the Sinhala dynasty, led a team from the Indian continent and landed on Ceylon Island, introducing a higher civilization to Ceylon. He was especially skilled in cultivation. The oldest large reservoir for irrigating fields near Anuradhapura was built by Vijaya's successor around 504 BC. At the beginning of the third century BC, Prince Ashoka sent people to Ceylon Island to spread Buddhism, which was believed by the residents of the entire island. Later, the Tamil people from the Malabar coast of western India invaded Ceylon and often ruled it, but in 1071 AD, the Sinhala king Meng restored the throne.</p>
<p>In 1408 (the sixth year of the Yongle reign of Emperor Chengzu of the Ming Dynasty), China sent troops to conquer the Sinhala dynasty due to being insulted during an envoy to Ceylon. They attacked Ceylon and captured King Vijayabahu IV. For the next thirty years, the Sinhala king paid tribute to China every year.</p>
<p>In 1505, the Portuguese Almeida arrived in Ceylon and saw that the island had been divided into seven kingdoms. Eleven years later, the governor of the Goa region on the west coast of India ordered the construction of a fortress in Colombo. From then until the rise of the Dutch in the seventeenth century, the Portuguese devoted themselves to establishing their rule in Ceylon, repeatedly fighting with the local chieftains and Arabs on the island, and achieving considerable victories. In 1638, the Dutch army expeditioned to Ceylon and destroyed the Portuguese fortresses on the east coast. By 1658, the Portuguese were finally expelled from their last stronghold in Ceylon Island, Jaffna. In 1795, the British broke off relations and sent troops to occupy Ceylon. In 1803, the Treaty of Amiens was signed, formally ceding this Dutch colony to Britain. On March 2, 1815, Britain signed a treaty with the Kandyan chiefs of Ceylon Island, declaring that the entire sovereignty of the island belonged to the British King.</p>
<p>The population of Ceylon Island is now less than six million people. The Sinhalese account for about seven-tenths, and most of the rest are Tamils. There are also many other ethnic groups, the largest of which are the Moor people of Arab descent who believe in Islam.</p>
<p>Ceylon Island is mainly agricultural, with rice, which is mainly consumed by the island itself, being the most important product. In addition, it also produces coconuts, graphite, cocoa, cinnamon, lemon oil, nutmeg, betel nuts, and tobacco. Ceylon Island also has many gemstones, the most important of which are rubies and sapphires. Pearls can also be harvested in the Gulf of Mannar.</p>
<p>The capital Colombo is quite prosperous and is known as the fifth largest city in the world, with a population of about 300,000. The Colombo Museum has magnificent buildings and contains a large number of ancient artifacts and specimens, such as ancient Portuguese and Dutch furniture, Sinhala jewelry, ivory carvings, handwritten books, and bronzes. Victoria Park, the Asokaramaya Buddhist temple, Hindu temples, relics from the Portuguese occupation, ancient Dutch churches and cemeteries, and the Betah land owner's Islamic hall are all famous places.

<p>Ceylon's Holy Mountain</p>
<p>Adam's Peak is the holy mountain of Ceylon. Although this mountain is only 7,300 feet high, because there is a giant's footprint on the top of the mountain, everyone regards it as a very sacred place. This "footprint" is about two yards long, and believers of various religions say that the footprint was left by the giant god they believe in. It is said that this holy mountain has been revered by the people of Ceylon for two thousand years.</p>
<h3>HSBC Bank Begins Third Round of Withdrawals, Paying Out 25% of Balance, Mercantile Bank to Begin Next Monday</h3>
<p>The English-language "Ta Mei Wan Pao" reports that it has learned today (April 15th) that two major British banks in Shanghai are paying out another batch of deposits to all depositors, including Allied depositors. One is HSBC Bank, which is starting this morning to pay out another 25% of the original deposit balance as of December 6th of last year to each depositor. Mercantile Bank will begin paying out 30% of the original balance as of December 6th of last year from April 20th, which is next Monday. It is also heard that Citibank will also pay out another batch of deposits in the near future, with the date possibly within next week, but the exact date has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>Total Amount of Withdrawals for Large and Small Depositors</p>
<p>This is the third batch of deposits to be paid out since the outbreak of the Pacific War on December 8th. For HSBC Bank, it is now paying out another 25% of the total amount of deposits, which is half of the frozen deposit balance. When Shanghai was occupied by the Japanese army, half of all deposits were transferred to Yokohama Specie Bank, and the remaining balance was frozen. Subsequently, 15% of it was paid out, so after today's additional 25% payment, small depositors have actually withdrawn 80% of the total amount of their deposit balance as of December 6th of last year. The amount of withdrawals for large depositors ranges from 75% to 80%. According to an HSBC employee, the reason for the difference in the percentage of deposits withdrawn by large and small depositors is that after the outbreak of the war, each depositor was paid 2,000 yuan as quickly as possible. The purpose of paying out 2,000 yuan in deposits was to assist small depositors, so it can be seen that the smaller the deposit, the higher the percentage of deposits withdrawn.</p>
<p>Mercantile's Three Withdrawal Periods</p>
<p>As for Mercantile Bank, it will also begin paying out the third batch of deposits from Monday, which is 30% of the deposit balance as of December 6th of last year after deducting 2,000 yuan. The total percentage of withdrawals before and after is 80% of the original balance. Mercantile Bank paid out the first batch of deposits of 2,000 yuan on January 17th of this year, and the second batch of 50% was paid out starting from January 19th. The remaining balance was transferred to Mitsui Bank, but transactions related to these balances are still handled by Mercantile Bank. The following deposits are still temporarily frozen: (A) Deposits of Chinese people exceeding 100 yuan, pending a decision by the Japanese authorities on the value of the deposits. (B) Deposits of depositors indebted to the bank, pending their debts being cleared. There are no restrictions on the deposits of people from non-belligerent countries. As for the remaining deposits, which are approximately 25% of the original balance, it is expected that they will eventually be paid out in one or more batches. Mercantile Bank is not currently making payments.</p>
<h3>Anti-Epidemic Campaign Begins in This City, More Than 40,000 People Vaccinated in Two Days</h3>
<p>Since the health authorities of this city launched the anti-epidemic campaign on Monday (April 13th), more than 40,000 people have been vaccinated against cholera for free in the first two days. This vaccination campaign is being carried out simultaneously in the two concessions and the Chinese area. The Japanese authorities in this city have also adopted mandatory measures to implement vaccinations to prevent the occurrence of cholera. The Japanese military authorities are requiring vaccinations at all bridges over the Suzhou Creek. Nearly 6,000 people have been vaccinated on the 13th and 14th. At the same time, the health offices set up by the Public Concession and the French Concession have also been busy vaccinating residents gathered there for several days. In addition, the mobile teams of the health offices of the two concessions have also been going to various businesses to carry out collective vaccinations against cholera. According to a spokesman for the Public Works Department, cholera vaccinations in the Public Concession are free of charge, and anti-epidemic certificates applicable to this city can also be obtained free of charge. It is said that the anti-epidemic certificates issued by the Public Works Department are also recognized by the Japanese military authorities, so this certificate is also valid when passing over the bridges on the Suzhou Creek. However, the Health Department of the Bureau charges 10 yuan in Reserve Certificates for issuing special anti-epidemic certificates to people leaving Shanghai. As for those who hire doctors to get vaccinated, if they need proof, the doctor must first send a letter to the Health Department to obtain it and pay a fee of 5 yuan in Reserve Certificates. The vaccinations at the health offices of the two concessions are not limited in time, while the Japanese authorities' vaccinations on the Suzhou Creek bridges are scheduled to end on the 28th of this month.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Spokesman Discusses Requisitioning Cars, Those Suitable for Military Use Will Be Confiscated, Limited to Nationals of Belligerent Countries</h3>
<p>The English-language "Ta Mei Wan Pao" reports that Lieutenant Matsuda, assistant spokesman for the Japanese Army, expressed the Japanese Army authorities' gratitude for the cooperation of various enemy nationals with the Japanese side's announcement on requisitioning cars from enemy nationals in Shanghai at a press conference yesterday (April 14th). It is said that as of 3:00 PM on Tuesday, enemy nationals had turned in approximately 300 cars. The announcement stipulated that cars must be turned in on April 13th, 14th, and 15th, so today (April 15th) is the deadline. The Japanese authorities have received approximately eight-tenths of the cars registered by enemy nationals. Those that are suitable for military use will be confiscated. However, the Japanese authorities will take an extremely lenient attitude towards the remaining cars and are currently studying methods. The announcement stated that the names of the areas where enemy nationals must turn in their cars were omitted and did not mention the Western District, that is, the Hongqiao District is also included. As for Indians and Filipinos, they should also turn in their cars to assist the Japanese authorities in conducting investigations.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Notice: Additional Surcharge Implemented Yesterday</h3>

<h3>First Group of British and American Nationals Arrive in Shanghai from Yantai; Totaling Twenty-Seven People</h3>
<p>The English-language "Ta Mei Evening News" reports that Kawasaki, a spokesman for the embassy here, stated at a press conference yesterday (the 14th) that the first group of British and American nationals from various parts of China, who were to be exchanged, arrived in Shanghai by ship from Yantai on Monday. Other British and American nationals who are about to be evacuated are expected to arrive here successively as shipping permits. A total of twenty-seven people arrived from Yantai, arriving in Shanghai earlier than originally expected. This group includes fourteen British nationals and thirteen American nationals, led by British Consul in Yantai, Budett, and American Consul, Roberts, respectively. Among the British nationals are six men, three women, and four children. Among the American nationals are eight men and seven women. Some have checked into the International Hotel, while others are staying at the Huamei Hotel. Among them are former customs officers, missionaries, and several bankers. All must remain in Shanghai until next month when they will begin their evacuation.</p>
<h3>Factories and Institutions May Apply for Rice</h3>
<p>Employees of 30 or More Eligible to Apply Directly</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council has issued a notice regarding applications for rice supply for factories and offices, stating: "It is hereby notified that factories and offices operating in the Public Concession that manufacture essential goods and employ at least 30 permanent Chinese employees may now apply directly for rice supply at Room 701, General Office of this Bureau, No. 209 Hankou Road. All applications must be accompanied by a list stating the number of employees, the amount of rice currently in stock and required, and must be certified as accurate by a recognized accountant. This notice is hereby issued for general information."</p>
<h3>Roadside Markers Erected to Indicate High Tide Levels</h3>
<p>In order to prevent high tides during the autumn flood season this year, the Shanghai Municipal Council Public Works Department, in addition to dredging underground sewers where necessary and appropriately raising low-lying road surfaces, has recently erected concrete tide level marker posts on the steps of important roads prone to high tide flooding, such as Nanjing Road, Zhejiang Road, Zhibu Road, and west Guizhou Road. These markers indicate tide heights from 13 feet to 16 feet 5 inches above the lowest tide level, for identification purposes.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over Payment, False Accusation Against Younger Brother</h3>
<p>Wei Chi Zhao Shan (also known as Bao Qing), the owner of the Yunnan Road Hankou Guansheng Canned Food Company, previously accused Wei Chi Zhao Jia (also known as Li Ting), the manager of the company and his younger brother, at the French Concession police station, of embezzlement, taking canned goods from the warehouse and selling them to Kaiyuan Food Company, a total of 350 boxes. After detailed investigation by detectives, it has been determined that the defendant sold these goods with the prior consent of his elder brother, the plaintiff, first selling them to Zheng Ming Ji, who resold them to Xiao Hecheng Confectionery on Baliqiao Street, and then to Yuan at No. 17, Laozha Road. The goods were sold and purchased according to market prices, with no intentional receiving of stolen goods. The case originates from a dispute between the brothers over payment and the desire to recover the goods for resale at a higher price due to soaring market prices. They maliciously accused Kaiyuan Company of receiving stolen goods. The police are now conducting a thorough investigation, and the plaintiff may face charges of false accusation.</p>
<h3>Fires in the Public Concession Last Month</h3>
<p>Totaled Sixty-Three</p>
<p>In March of this year, the Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade in the Public Concession received a total of sixty-three alarms, including fires burning garbage or similar items, nine false alarms, a malicious fire alarm, a chimney fire, and a special emergency alarm. The remaining forty-nine were actual fires. Property located in the Public Concession and the Western District that suffered losses due to fire is estimated to be worth approximately 555,818 yuan and 39,600 yuan, respectively, totaling approximately 595,418 yuan. Nine people died in the fires, including one who died in the fire and eight who died in bomb explosions. Eighteen civilians were injured (three due to fire and fifteen due to bomb explosions), as well as six fire brigade personnel.

<h3>Haifu Steamer to Sail to Dinghai</h3>
<p>Expected to Commence in Early May</p>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that while the procedures for the Haifu steamer to operate the Shanghai-Dinghai route are gradually being completed, there is still no confirmed date for its commencement. The Hana steamer's operation to Ningbo has not materialized. The following is noted:</p>
<p>Haifu to Sail to Dinghai, Expected Next Month</p>
<p>The Haifu steamer of the Lihe Shipping Department has now been restored to the name of the Chinese-owned Zhoushan Navigation Company and is scheduled to operate on the Shanghai-Dinghai route, also calling at Shenjiamen. The necessary procedures for its operation are gradually being completed, and job assignments have also been internally finalized. However, there is still no confirmed date for its commencement. According to speculation within the shipping industry, it is generally expected to commence in early May.</p>
<p>Hana to Sail to Ningbo, Has Not Materialized</p>
<p>After ceasing operations last year, the steamer has been berthed at the Dongjiadu pontoon on the Huangpu River. The ship has recently been repainted, and this has now been completed. The Hana steamer, moored near the steamer and owned by the German-owned Far East Company, has also been repainted. There was previously talk of the ship operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, but this has now subsided.</p>
<p>Moufuk Remains Detained; No Release News</p>
<p>The Moufuk steamer of the German-owned Lihe Foreign Firm, formerly known as the Ningshao steamer, was detained while en route to Wenzhou last year and is moored in Dinghai. There was talk of the steamer resuming its original name and operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, but this was abandoned because those in charge of the ship were not in Shanghai and no one was able to make a decision. Therefore, the steamer remains detained in Dinghai.</p>
<p>Limited Cabin Space on Shanghai-Ningbo Steamers</p>
<p>The steamers currently operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo route are all small in tonnage and have a limited passenger capacity, each only able to accommodate five or six hundred passengers. As many people are currently leaving Shanghai to return to their hometowns, purchasing tickets is quite difficult. Unless larger tonnage steamers are added to the route, passengers traveling between Shanghai and Ningbo will suffer great hardship.</p>
<h3>Many Leaving Shanghai for Ningbo; Ningbo's Market Conditions Flourish</h3>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that due to the large number of people from Ningbo, Zhenhai, Cixi, and other places returning to their hometowns, the market conditions in Ningbo are more prosperous than before. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Since last spring, due to changes in local conditions in Ningbo, most of the residents in the urban area moved their homes to other places, with only a small number of poor households remaining. Soon, as local order was restored, residents who had moved to other places returned one after another, and the market gradually flourished, and it has recently returned to its former state. The streets and alleys are filled with people, and public security has also been restored. The situation in the surrounding villages is similar.</p>
<p>Recently, the market in Zhenhai has recovered to its pre-incident state. According to people from the area, the bustling sections of the city are lined with shops, and the streets are crowded, a world of difference from the desolate scene six months ago. Recently, steamers sailing between Shanghai and Ningbo are also making frequent stops, making it easier for passengers to travel, and the urban population has increased several times.</p>
<p>The situation in the urban area of Cixi has been very good in recent months. The prices of daily necessities and food are roughly the same as before. The population has increased two to three times recently. However, there are many unemployed people, so there are a large number of people setting up stalls to run small businesses in the bustling areas. Many of the natives of Ningbo, Zhenhai, Cixi, Xiangshan, Fenghua, and other places who reside in this port have been returning to their hometowns due to the rising prices of goods in this city and the difficulty in purchasing rice and coal. However, since the direct steamers between Shanghai and Ningbo have temporarily stopped carrying passengers, most of those who urgently want to return to their hometowns are detouring through Dinghai, Shenjiamen, and other ports, and then taking sailboats to Zhenhai, or from Zhenhai to other places. It is said that although the journey takes many days, there are no difficulties.</p>
<h3>Gang of Thieves Cracked; Many Crimes Discovered</h3>
<p>Song Bingzheng, a Chinese detective from the Cheng Du Road police station, along with detectives Sun Wenxi and Zhang Kuidong, and Japanese detective Mori Susumu, recently apprehended major thieves Zhu Shigen, Yu Guliang, Cao Kechang, Zhang Sanbao, Mao Binghe, Li Tubao, Lin Changzhen, and Zhou Abing at Room 254 of the Dongfang Hotel, No. 59, Lane 381, Wusong Road, and No. 16, Lane 83, Wuzhou Road. They also confiscated a box cannon, three handguns, and three lotus blossom handguns with more than forty bullets in them at No. 776, Renzhi Lane, North Sichuan Road. It was discovered that Zhu and the others had committed robberies, including stealing more than 30,000 yuan from the Huayi Candle Factory at No. 23, Lane 478, Tiantong Road, more than 10,000 yuan worth of property from the Yinghong Brothel at No. 18, Huile Lane, Fuzhou Road, more than 20,000 yuan worth of property from the owner of the Maochang Optical Company at No. 58, Lane 97, Mei Ge Road, and more than ten other robberies. Stolen goods, including jewelry and silver dollars worth more than 10,000 yuan, were seized and taken into custody for further investigation to determine whether they were involved in other crimes. Zhu Guisheng, a 58-year-old native of Nantong, robbed cigarettes from a rickshaw at the intersection of Kaizi Road and Belle Road on February 22 of this year because he was impoverished and starving. He was arrested and detained, but became ill during the investigation and died in the hospital despite treatment. Because he had no family, the body was buried by a charity.</p>
<p>Belle Road, Kangdi Road</p>
<p>Car and Tram Collide</p>
<p>At around 9:00 AM yesterday, a black-plate car with license number 752 was driving through the intersection of Belle Road and Kangdi Road in the French Concession when it collided with tramcar number 152 on route 17 of the French-owned Tram Company. The front of the car was severely damaged, and the tramcar also suffered some damage. Nanjing Road Wing On Company's 3.33% annual dividend for the 30th year has been converted into shares. Shareholders who converted their old shares into new shares have been issued temporary receipts by the company. It is now known that these receipts have been officially exchanged for stock certificates since the 15th of this month. Holders of these receipts are advised to take note.</p>
<h3>Rental Payments in New Currency; Renters Urge Rent Reduction</h3>
<p>Recently, some landlords in the city have declared that they will collect rent in the new currency, and many have already implemented this policy. However, most tenants believe that paying rent in the new currency would be equivalent to increasing the original rent by 30%. At a time when the cost of living is high and it is already difficult to make ends meet, how can they bear to increase their expenses? Therefore, in recent days, residents and businesses in some alleys have been calling on landlords who collect rent in the new currency to reduce the original rent by 30%, so that paying in the new currency would be fair in reason and emotion. Otherwise, it would only add to the burden on the common people. It is also heard that the authorities are considering solutions to this issue.</p>
<h3>The Music Scene in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Since spring, the music scene in Shanghai has indeed flourished. In the past month alone, there have been no fewer than ten public concerts. Moreover, with the drastic reduction in the source of films, a part of Shanghai people's interest has turned to music. At each concert, we can always find a group of Chinese audiences, which was rare in the past. They may be young music students, or just enthusiastic lovers, but they all have a kind of desire, a pursuit and understanding of advanced art. Under normal circumstances, we have to say that this is a good phenomenon.</p>
<p>Although Shanghai is an international metropolis, the music scene has always been very indifferent. For many years, the Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra has been supporting this barren garden. They regularly perform at the Lyceum Theatre every Sunday afternoon at 5:00 PM. The conductor is the famous Italian musician Mario Paci. Almost all the members of this orchestra are foreigners. There are only three Chinese members, Chen Youxin, Ma Sicong, and Ma Sizhong. Most of them are of German, Italian, or Russian nationality. The first violinist is Professor Foa, who is also Italian. He has performed solos many times in the past. As for his superb skills and high cultivation, the audience should be familiar with this. At the beginning of March this year, the Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra held two consecutive concerts commemorating the 150th anniversary of Mozart's death, and invited sixteen famous singers from the city to participate in the performance, which was a great success. Recently, the orchestra has invited pianists such as Wineia Tomaszewska and Susanne Decllety to cooperate and perform the works of masters such as Grieg, Schumann, and Vincentd'Indy. Because the orchestra is suitable for the level of Westerners, the standard is relatively high. It is difficult for Chinese audiences to understand without high cultivation.</p>
<p>In addition to the Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra, other formal music organizations in the city include the Ejas Club, which regularly performs at the Jewish Community Center. This group has most of the city's famous singers. The conductor is the Russian Margolinski. Recently, a Schubert concert was held. In addition, the Russian Light Opera Troupe and the Russian Dance Troupe regularly perform at the Lyceum Theatre. The latter recently entered the Grand Theatre and performed programs such as "Poet Travels to Hell" and "Falling City". The troupe has more than 20 musicians, and the conductor is Sloutiky. The Chinese audience has a very good impression of its past performances.</p>
<p>Speaking of the formal organization of the Chinese music scene, we can't help but feel ashamed. We know very well that there is no shortage of musicians with high cultivation among the Chinese people, but it seems that there is no concrete organization. Until recently, Mr. Li Weining and the YMCA initiated a more sound and planned group, which injected a new stimulant into the silent air. Mr. Li Weining is the current acting president of the National Conservatory of Music. He is a student of Vincentd'Indy, a master of modern French music, and has an honorary title from the Vienna Conservatory of Music. He has a deep artistic attainments. In the first regular concert he initiated on the 4th of this month, he personally participated in the piano accompaniment. This was a solo recital by contralto Sabina Rapp, singing small pieces by Schubert, Hugo Wikf, Brahms, Wagner, Debussy, etc. Li's own works such as "Midnight", "First Meeting", and "Homesickness" were also sung. Except for the works of French writers, which were sung in French, all other works, including Li's works, were sung in German. Li's works, in terms of meaning and expression, are difficult to compare with other famous musicians, but Li's spirit of pioneering and bravery is admirable.</p>
<p>The concerts initiated by the YMCA have been held several times before, and famous singers such as Wu Zhengqian have performed on stage. The concert held last Saturday was mainly led by the Ma sisters, and soprano Chen Menglan participated in the cooperation. Ms. Chen sang lyrical short pieces this time, with piano accompaniment by Paci, the conductor of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Few people in Shanghai have this honor. Paci's own work "Dao", which he composed when he was a student at the Conservatory 40 years ago, was also sung on the same day. However, Ms. Chen's voice is still too narrow, and she cannot cope with high scales easily and lacks expression. The violin solo by Ma Sicong and the piano solo by Ms. Ma Sizhong are both above standard. All the pieces played that day were technically difficult, and it is absolutely difficult to play them without high cultivation. The last piece was "Dance Music" composed by his elder brother Ma Sitsong. This was created by Ma referring to the folk songs of Suiyuan and Sichuan during his travels, and adding various variations, with extremely beautiful and harmonious strings and a strong oriental sentiment. This kind of experimental work was unanimously praised and praised by the audience.</p>
<p>Recently, a group of young people in Shanghai who love music, because they feel that there are too few opportunities to appreciate music, initiated the organization of record concerts. Under the current circumstances, this can be regarded as an innovation. They held their first concert during the Easter holiday, and all the programs were works by Schubert. According to Schubert, a great genius, died unfortunately at the age of thirty-two, but left a rich legacy, including works in all departments of music. His music is relatively familiar in the understanding of the Chinese people, so this time there was a satisfactory harvest. Now they are scheduled to hold it every two weeks. Next Sunday's program is all the works of the Italian master Carolos. Other works such as Beethoven and Mozart are also scheduled to be played in the short term. However, because it is just beginning, there are many difficulties, and everything is still awaiting the support and well-intentioned criticism of the public.</p>
<p>Regarding the publications on music in Shanghai, it can be said that there is a complete lack of them. Only the French daily newspaper has a music criticism column every Sunday. Other recent Shanghai art monthly magazines also briefly introduce it, but there are too few words in this area to meet the needs of readers. We hope that the editors of the magazine can do their best in this area.</p>
<p>What can be predicted at present is that Aurora University will hold a concert on the 26th of this month, sung by Ms. Lang Yuxiu and others. In addition, on May 5th, there will be Li's second regular concert, all violin programs, with Alder, a violinist from the Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra, participating in the performance. All music lovers, don't miss this opportunity. (Jinchuan)</p>
<h3>Taiwan Bank Military Notes Fraudulently Cashed</h3>
<p>One Check Paper Missing, Totaling 40,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Japanese-owned Taiwan Bank at No. 20 Jiujiang Road discovered during reconciliation the other day that military notes worth 40,000 yuan (equivalent to 280,000 yuan in national currency) had been fraudulently cashed. The bank immediately reported this to the Central Police Station, and Chinese detective Wu Yaozu went to investigate and confirmed the facts. A depositor in the bank used a check paper to cash Japanese military notes worth 40,000 yuan. The receiving clerk gave the check to Yang Songshou (resident of No. 89, Baisongfang, Huage Road), a local in charge of verifying signatures, for verification. After verifying that it was correct, Yang Songshou stamped it and sent it to the cashier's department for payment. When the accounts were reconciled, the cashier's department had an account for this 40,000 yuan, but Yang Songshou's account had no such account. Moreover, the check could not be found. An investigation of the depositor also revealed that they had not cashed this amount. It was also discovered that one of the deposit account's check papers was missing. It appeared that someone had stolen an old check, forged the signature, fraudulently cashed this huge sum of money, and then tried to steal the check in order to destroy the evidence. The most suspected persons in this incident are Yang Songshou and the trainees Wang Amao and Lu Binghe, who are natives of Yong. Yang and the others were taken to the police station for investigation, but they all denied it. They were temporarily detained and will be investigated thoroughly before further action is taken.</p>
<h3>Rongwu Sutra, The Doctrine of the Mean Essence</h3>
<p>The 42nd session of the Rongwu Sutra Society and the 8th session of the National Studies Lecture, Mr. Yang Zhongyi lectured on the essence of The Doctrine of the Mean (III), saying: "The Doctrine of the Mean is the 31st chapter of the Book of Rites. Kong Shu quotes Zheng's catalogue, 'This book belongs to general discussion in the separate records.' Yan's note in the Han Shu says, 'The Book of Rites has The Doctrine of the Mean, which is not the original scripture of Rites.' The Summary of the Four Libraries says, 'The Han scholars compiled it into the Book of Rites because it has nothing to attach to. In fact, it does not belong to the Five Rites.' (Transmission) The ancient sages established the standard and transmitted the orthodoxy. Yao授舜 with one word '执中', and Shun益三言以授禹.

<h3>Announcement of Winners in Unified Lottery: Bond Markets Excited</h3>
<p>The bond market, at two o'clock yesterday, was suddenly excited because the winning numbers for the 13th round of Type A bonds, totaling 44 numbers, had been published in the newspapers. There were also reports of peace talks between England and Germany, although far from being a reality, it was enough to slightly excite the weary public. Furthermore, the most noteworthy event was the change in policy regarding the sale of shares by the large Kangcheng company. The short sellers temporarily lost their support, and market prices soared upwards. Yitai was the first to buy in, and Lianhe also bought in aggressively, with both companies buying about 600,000 to 700,000 shares. Tongkang sold off shares, leading to speculation that Dakangcheng also sold off 200,000 to 300,000 shares. Therefore, when Type C bonds rose to 1.2 yuan, sellers emerged in large numbers, including Shuntai, Jiufeng, Hu Heji, Lianyi, Hongda, Yongkang, and Dechang, all offering shares. Although Shunli, Tongshun, Xiekang, Gongmao, Xinji, Runde, and Hongxing, among others, continued to buy, the price of Type C bonds still fell back to 0.66 or 0.67 yuan. However, market sentiment was more stable than before. Even if Dakangcheng were to sell off more shares, it would be a spent force, and the outlook should improve slightly. Currently, Type D and Type E bonds are the cheapest, with Type E being more than 3 yuan cheaper than Type C, and Type D being 6 yuan cheaper. It is expected that some will switch from Type C to Type D and Type E. As a result, market prices generally rebounded by several angles to 1.1 yuan, with approximately 1.2 million to 1.3 million yuan in transactions. A summary table is listed below: Category Highest Lowest Closing Change from Previous Day Unified Type A 68.00 67.50 Rose by 1.10 Unified Type B 61.80 61.20 61.20 Rose by 0.20 Unified Type C 61.20 60.50 60.85 Rose by 0.65 Unified Type D 55.50 54.40 54.85 Rose by 1.05 Unified Type E 58.00 57.70 57.70 Rose by 0.70</p>

<h3>Woolen Fabrics Are Easy to Rise and Hard to Fall</h3>
<p>Ramie cloth continues to rise</p>
<p>Yesterday, the woolen fabric market was tight again. Winter and summer goods saw further price increases because inventories were increasingly short. Both domestic and foreign traders were hoarding goods, holding onto them tightly and not releasing them. Many businesses were buying in and rarely selling. Although actual sales were lower than before due to the high prices, the demand from tailors was not weak. Shops were taking many orders for two or three-piece suits, leading to rising prices for wool, cotton, silk, yarn, and ramie textiles. Even percales and horsehair canvas, which had once retreated, are now rising again. Overall, the recent woolen fabric market has become easy to rise and hard to fall. Traders view overcoating wools as particularly scarce and expensive. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson and Yingfeng percales were selling for 110 yuan per yard, Lixing for 120 yuan, horsehair canvas for 3 yuan, Gongping soft lining for 6 yuan, Yousheng waterproof cloth for 20 yuan, Pao Po Lin for 23 yuan, Yuanfeng Van Alen topping for 188 yuan, Meifeng overcoating wool for 250 yuan, Gongda overcoating wool for 150 yuan, and Jardine Matheson 1-28 riding breeches for 188 yuan. Ramie cloth also rose again due to inventory shortages and the temporary shutdown of production at the two major factories, Baoxin and Lianxin. Additionally, the Nanjing Gang Huasheng Dun Lianxing received permits to ship out 500 bolts. The prices of all kinds of goods were rising, and as the weather warmed up, actual sales to the market resumed, and the trend turned around again, with prices rising again. Yesterday, Baoxin Whale Star brand ramie cloth was selling in batches at 10.05 yuan per yard, Lianxin Dafugui at 10 yuan, and Gongda sold military tickets for 4.75 yuan. Sanjiang ramie cloth was selling for 57-58 yuan, and 36-inch Belgian ramie cloth was selling for 40 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cash Shops Have Supply: Boiled Red Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the black market for cash and boiled red continued to decline slightly, with a total of 70-80 taels traded. Sentiment was soft, and cash shops were still willing to supply. They first sold 10 taels to a certain bank for 18,200 yuan, which was 200 yuan lower than the previous day. Then it rebounded slightly. A certain securities firm purchased 30 taels of cash on behalf of the Tianjin gang from a cash shop, with the final transaction price at 18,300 yuan. At noon, sellers offered at the above price, and buyers returned to 18,200 yuan, more than 100 yuan lower than the previous day.</p>
<p>Jewelers were exchanging ornaments at 1,900 yuan per tael (purchase price reduced by 100 yuan). Silver bars were quoted at 18 yuan, and the black market retreated to around 13.5 yuan. Silver coins also retreated to 8 yuan, with few transactions, it is said.</p>
<h3>Interbank Discounting Rate Drops by Five Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the interbank lending rate set by the Money Trade Association remained at 7%. The discounting rate for head-marked checks dropped from around 30 yuan per thousand to 15 yuan, a further decrease of 5 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Remain Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign currency market was uneventful. British and American gold pounds remained unchanged, the former at 430 yuan and the latter at 440 yuan. US dollar notes retreated to a buying price of 29 yuan and a selling price of 30 yuan. Hong Kong notes continued to rise to 4.2 yuan, with large notes decreasing by 0.1 yuan. Military notes opened at 7.3 yuan in the morning, then retreated to 7.22 yuan, and finally closed at 7.25 yuan, slightly down by 0.02 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Soar: No Standards</h3>
<p>Continuous rain has brought business from the surrounding areas to a standstill. It is also rumored that the purchase price in rural villages in the interior has increased by 0.9 yuan per liter due to the availability of cheap Yao ocean rice, followed by further price increases. As a result, the costs have increased, and asking prices have also been raised. Yesterday, it was rumored that goods could not be sourced from the surrounding areas, and prices outside the city were soaring, around 400 yuan. At the same time, early and late rice in the French Concession continued to rise sharply, selling at 435 yuan, 430 yuan, high-end at 440 yuan, 438 yuan. In the British Concession, it rose to 450 yuan, 445 yuan, a sharp increase of over 20 yuan. There were transactions without a market, and prices had no standards.</p>
<h3>Coarse Grains Driven Up by Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday's coarse grains market saw a slight recovery, influenced by rising rice prices. Sales in the local market were quite good, so the prices of all goods rose together. However, due to the ongoing controls, transactions were still limited. A unified market sold 100 bags of Tianjin Jinyuan at 223 yuan, cash on delivery. 80 bags of Chongming Shachi at 199 yuan. 50 bags of Taicang Red Bean at 196 yuan. Over 100 bags of Wujiang picked green at 200 yuan. Shengji soybean cake new warehouse orders for April, 4,000 pieces, traded at 50.05 to 51.5 yuan.

<h3>Rayon Market Fluctuates</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rayon market went from weak to firm. In the morning, 120 Tianqiao bright silk small boxes opened at 8,700 yuan, then rose to 8,750 yuan, and then returned to 8,720 yuan. 120 Golden Rooster semi-gloss large boxes traded at 8,840 yuan, an increase of 15 yuan from the previous day. 75 Golden Rooster semi-gloss small boxes opened at 8,240 yuan, then gradually decreased to 8,200 yuan. 120 White Fuji bright silk small boxes opened at 8,600 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3>Soap and Matches: Difficult to Sell</h3>
<p>The market for daily necessities showed little change. Because sales channels are still narrow, speculators are stagnant. The market is oversupplied. Yesterday, Gu Ben soap was selling at 320 yuan, White Xiangmao soap at 300 yuan, Yellow Xiangmao soap at 280 yuan, Arrow Knife soap at 285 yuan, Beauty Brand matches at 5,500 yuan, Phoenix Brand at 5,300 yuan, and White Lees Brand candles at 170 yuan, Sengmao at 165 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Selling Prices</h3>
<p>The downward trend of cigarettes is like a flood, causing great discouragement. Although there are widespread rumors of a possible increase in additional taxes, it does not attract attention from all parties and is still weak and difficult to boost. This is due to the weakness of actual sales, so prices continue to show a downward trend. Great British Brand was selling at 9,600 yuan per case, Old Knife Brand at 8,700 yuan, Pin Hai Brand at 6,100 yuan, Little Fairy Brand at 5,600 yuan, and Five Flower Brand at 5,400 yuan, a further decrease of 100 yuan from the previous day. Japanese cigarettes saw mixed increases and decreases. Golden Gun Brand traded at 2,450 yuan, Golden Building at 2,550 yuan, Quanlu Brand at 2,800 yuan, and Red Rose at 2,050 yuan, with the end result being very little change. Domestic cigarettes, Beauty Brand at 5,250 yuan, and Golden Mouse Brand at 3,150 yuan, also trended towards softness, with the price of 25,000 cigarettes down by 150 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Soy Sauce and Vegetables Scarce and Expensive</h3>
<p>Five-spice vegetables, a common side dish, were originally very cheap. Before the Great War, they were less than 200 yuan. Now they are also expensive, reaching 370 yuan. It is said that goods en route have already been shipped out and will arrive soon, but the exchange rate is still high, and it is difficult to expect a price decrease. Soy sauce and vegetables are scarce on the market and even more expensive, reaching 500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Port Longan Costs Increase</h3>
<p>Shipments of Shima longan have been scarce for a long time, and inventories on the market are low. It has been learned that the most recent shipments have had dozens of cases transported to Shanghai, and the establishment costs are higher than before. External expenses have also increased, requiring an additional 50 to 60 yuan compared to before, it is said.</p>
<h3>Pearl Barley Continues to Rise by 100 Yuan</h3>
<p>Because pearl barley has not arrived from any source, those holding goods are holding on to them even more firmly. Therefore, the market situation continues to tighten. Compared to the selling price at the beginning of the month, the increase has been nearly 100 yuan. Because market inventories are becoming thinner, the market is still expected to rise further.</p>

<p>War</p>
<h3>Wartime Life of the American People</h3>
<p>— Wang Xuan</p>
<p>Recent news from Washington, transmitted by the Axis powers, briefly describes the impact of the war on the lives of the American people. At the same time, it also gives us a glimpse of America's active commitment to the war effort.</p>
<p>The lives of the American people have always been known for their excellence, seeking pleasure and enjoyment, surpassing the globe. But now, due to the launch of the war machine, this joyful life has come to an end. American retail stores have sufficient inventory, and people can still purchase all necessary household goods, but in the near future, supplies may become scarce, and a household rationing system may be implemented.</p>
<p>The installment payment method has always been popular in the United States. Many higher-priced goods, such as automobiles, can be paid for in installments to ease the burden. This method is now being greatly curtailed. When rationing is implemented, it may not be as strictly limited as in the United Kingdom, but canned goods will not be piled up in the kitchen as before, because canned goods are becoming scarce, and canning factories are trying to use other items to make canned goods to replace tinplate.</p>
<p>Relatively few people in the United States drink tea, but over time, tea may also become scarce, and coffee rationing is most likely. Other spices and olive oil, the sources of which have been occupied, will also gradually become scarce in the future. In addition, there are concerns about the lack of woolen clothing and household appliances in the United States. All woolen fabrics produced in the United States this year will be used by the military, and civilians can only buy cotton-wool blends.</p>
<p>The weaving of silk stockings for women has stopped, and in the future, they will only be able to wear cotton and rayon socks. However, what worries the ladies and young women most is that rubber is being used for military purposes, so they will not be able to buy elastic corsets to maintain their slender bodies.</p>
<p>Americans have always been accustomed to and consider indispensable vacuum cleaners, electric refrigerators, washing machines, radios, and electric toasters, etc., but now they cannot be purchased at will as in the past. A certificate must be obtained before they can be purchased, because the factories that manufacture these appliances have mostly been converted into armories. For all warring countries, airplanes, tanks, artillery, and ships are more important than cans, pots, and electrical appliances, so it will not be easy to obtain various metal products in the future. Even the springs in mattresses and sofas have stopped being manufactured.</p>
<p>Until now, the pig bristles used in the United States have to be imported from abroad. During wartime, shipping is inconvenient, so alternative products will soon be used to manufacture brushes, etc., and the wool content of wool balls will also be reduced. Also, the production of automobiles and typewriters has been stopped, and the production of bicycles is also limited. In short, when a country is in a state of war, the lives of the people are greatly affected.</p>
<p>Psychology</p>
<h3>What is Genius?</h3>
<p>— He Kai</p>
<p>Can genius be measured? In fact, it can be measured and is being measured.</p>
<p>The United States has been engaged in extremely interesting experiments in the past few years. Recently, Professor Terman, a psychology professor at Stanford University, published his latest report. Professor Terman has been focusing on the study of genius for more than ten years.</p>
<p>These findings cannot tell us how to observe the budding of genius in little John or Mary, but they do tell us what they will probably become if they are indeed clever. However, the chance of Mary or any girl becoming a genius is close to zero. At the same time, Professor Terman shattered the general illusion of the past that genius is a freak with only one-sided talent.</p>
<p>"The typical genius is not a prodigy in a fragile body," he said. "The typical genius is healthier than the average person, and does not focus his interests on one side, while being foolish about everything else. He is versatile and able to do many things. He is not the fool in the family. The typical genius is not a poor wretch who frantically extracts his talent from the depths of his afflicted body and mind."</p>
<p>"He is happy, lives a happy married life, and is content with his work, hobbies, and family."</p>
<p>This is the result of his measurement of genius. Thirty years ago, he selected 1,300 of the most gifted children in California, accounting for about 5% of the total population, and followed their subsequent development step by step. He was able to maintain contact with 95% of them and conducted regular surveys of the entire group. In his most recent survey, he found that some of them had achieved very superior positions in the business world and specialized professions, while others were in minor positions. He called them class A and class C.</p>
<p>Why did some succeed and others fail? They had roughly equal opportunities.</p>
<p>He found that the successful ones, that is, the true geniuses, always maintained a stable temperament. Their emotions never fell into confusion, and past records proved that this trace could be detected in them when they were children.</p>
<p>He found that Class A married earlier than Class C, had happier marriages, and achieved better marital adjustment. There were three times fewer divorce cases in Class A than in Class C.</p>
<p>The professor believes that it is sad that sex seems to be the most important factor governing genius. He said that if a talented woman cannot marry early, she will take up any job that can be found. In view of this, the professor said that he would no longer measure the genius of women.</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Gibraltar</h3>
<p>— Da Fen</p>
<p>The long-silent name of Gibraltar has now reappeared in the news. The situation in Europe today is like the wind filling the building before the rain comes. What position will this fortress at the Mediterranean mouth of the British Empire occupy?</p>
<p>It is said that Gibraltar has many elite troops stationed there. In the event of war, they will hide in the rock bunkers day and night, year after year, to defend this important stronghold.</p>
<p>It is impossible for any army to land from the sea and surprise Gibraltar. The rocks are steep, reaching a height of 1,200 feet, and the safe guards are all watching intently, leaving little room for opportunity. Heavy artillery, bombs, poison gas, hunger, or thirst may shake their fighting spirit for a while, but that is hard to say.</p>
<p>Outsiders are not allowed to visit the Gibraltar fortress. In the past, it was possible to visit the old fortresses left over from the Moorish wars, but now even that opportunity is gone. Outsiders can only imagine, without having the chance to see its true face. In short, inside there are rocks, cannons, armories, power plants, hospitals, etc. It is said that the cannons high above are all fakes, to consume the enemy's firepower, while the real cannons are hidden in the rocks below.</p>
<p>But how strong Gibraltar's resistance is can only be verified. Moreover, no one dares to predict what will happen if an offensive comes from land from Spain. But one thing can be asserted, that is, Gibraltar's food and munitions reserves are very abundant, enough to last for five years.</p>
<h3>Literary Men's Handwriting</h3>
<p>— Fan Shengzhi</p>
<p>Since literary men take writing as their main occupation, they inevitably spend their days with desks, pens, and paper, weaving their thoughts and inspirations into articles. The original manuscript of a famous work is often placed in a museum as a priceless treasure, forever inspiring future generations with high admiration. However, some are unfortunate; their ink hardly dries before becoming patrons of the editor's wastepaper basket, which is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>Therefore, a literary man's handwriting, that is, their script, is closely related to both the literary man themselves and the publishing industry, as well as bookstores. From a cultural perspective, it holds considerable historical value. In various European countries, museums have sections dedicated to exhibiting writers' original manuscripts, and writers' former residences are open to the public, showcasing their daily life and displaying their handwriting. Even ink blots on blotting paper are faintly visible. Places like the Gorky Museum in the Soviet Union, the studio of Mayakovsky, and the former residences of Wordsworth in England and Daudet's mill in France have become famous tourist attractions.</p>
<p>The handwriting of literary men and writers evokes a sense of intimacy. If you were to see the original manuscripts of Tolstoy's "Resurrection" and "War and Peace," with their web-like traces of multiple revisions, you would feel how much hard work the creator underwent to produce such a monumental work and spiritual food. Tolstoy's wife copied "War and Peace" seven times! Balzac, who created novels in a short period of time, hurriedly sent them to print, and after printing, felt dissatisfied and corrected them. He often corrected and reprinted a novel several times, leaving new handwriting annotations beside the printed words. Even today, French museums still preserve several of these sheets.</p>
<p>A miracle is often discovered from the handwriting of literary men: their handwriting is not necessarily good and is often called atrocious. Take Shakespeare, for example. His plays are immortal, but he was a famous poor writer. His handwriting was worse than that of an elementary school student. Perhaps when inspiration flows and thoughts surge, there is no time to care about the neatness of handwriting. When O'Henry had a "brainstorm," he would scribble on large-format manuscript paper with a reed pen, sometimes unable to decipher it himself. The manuscripts of the poet Carlyle were so illegible that the clerks who copied them often made mistakes, and after copying them, he would add and delete them again with a red ink pen, turning the manuscript paper into a palette. He said in a letter to a friend: "I am ashamed of my bad handwriting, but if I write slowly, the words may be neat, but the meaning I want to write will be forgotten. There is really no way to think about it." Even Rousseau, whose handwriting was beautiful, said: "If thinkers and creators write beautifully, their overflowing thoughts may not be fully expressed." This is probably the predicament of most writers.</p>
<p>Modern writers, especially American writers such as Lewis and Sinclair, have adopted commercial habits, replacing pens and ink with typewriters. This saves publishers some trouble with proofreading, but it also loses a sense of intimacy. However, as the younger Tolstoy said, "When writing with a typewriter, when you read it again, it has the meaning of reading the works of others and gaining a more objective meaning." The younger Tolstoy probably understood this benefit and often liked to write with a typewriter.</p>
<p>But in general, most people consider handwriting to be lovely and precious. In ancient China, literary men mostly sold both articles and calligraphy, and even took calligraphy as their main occupation, so it was rare to hear of poor handwriting among ancient Chinese literary men. Aren't the handwritings of the "Four Talents of Tang, Zhu, Wen, and Zhou" treasured by later book collectors? But I heard that there are many new literary men with strange handwritings, but because of square Chinese characters, no writer has been heard to have "evolved" to writing with a typewriter.</p>
<h3>Firefighting Weapon</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiao</p>
<p>When houses and warehouses catch fire, firefighters are often unable to enter immediately because the doors and windows are locked. Therefore, someone invented an oxygen-fueled flame cutter that can spray high heat, instantly melting steel and metal. Therefore, it is very suitable for cutting steel doors and iron locks. This thing is placed in a canvas bag and carried on the firefighter's back, weighing only forty-three pounds. Firefighters can also carry it on their backs and climb to high places to work, which is much more convenient.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat in Storm</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(Three) Guests Arrive</p>
<p>Wei Cheng told Huang Long the reason why he couldn't go, and Madam Ye Er helped him speak, saying it was late, cold, and inappropriate to drink alcohol while in mourning—all their reasons. Huang Long said: "So even if I brought the wine and dishes, Brother Wei Cheng couldn't eat them. Alright, I'll go." Huang Long picked up the lantern and waved it at Wei Cheng, as if waving goodbye. He walked to the courtyard, then came back and smiled: "Brother Wei Cheng, I don't hate you for not going." He stated this before striding out. Madam Ye Er said: "This person is always reckless, arriving abruptly and leaving strangely." Ah Xing laughed outside the door: "I'll let him in. His nose is snorting with anger, shooting out a white vapor, just like the light from a flashlight, and if he were born in the Song Dynasty, he would probably be a person like Niu Gao." Magpie also said, as if having a bone stuck in her throat that she had to spit out: "That morning, didn't he leave early? As soon as he went out, he raced with the dog we raised at home, and he ran even faster than the dog."</p>
<p>Another knock on the door interrupted the family's casual conversation. Madam Ye Er said, "Huang Long has changed his mind again and is inviting you. Are you going or not? If you want to go, let Ah Xing go with you. If you're cold, wrap your father's fox fur coat around yourself. Anyway, the first week has passed, and there's nothing to do tomorrow." Wei Cheng said, "I'm not going, I'm not going." Ah Xing opened the door for the person knocking, but it wasn't Huang Long. It was a country woman, also carrying a lantern in her hand. Madam Ye Er thought her face looked familiar but couldn't remember who she was. When the country woman saw Madam Ye Er and Wei Cheng, she said with anticipation: "Young Master Ye, it's terrible. Cui Zhen and her uncle have fallen out. Her uncle is being unreasonable. Please, Young Master Ye, go quickly!" Wei Cheng was stunned, and so were the others. Madam Ye Er hurriedly asked what the matter was. According to the country woman, she was a neighbor of Fei Changhe. Fei Changhe argued with Cui Zhen every few days, and others pitied Cui Zhen, but Cui Zhen always refused to tell others. (51)</p>
