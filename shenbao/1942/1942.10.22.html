<h3>法租界限制肉價已用強制行動掮客擾亂市場屢勸無效惟有直接買賣取締轉手</h3>
<p>過去一星期內法租界豬肉價格因各種掮客及中間人之操縱漁利較之限價高出不少警務當局先則客忍望投機者及時覺悟但事實上情勢日趨惡化乃於日前採取斷然行動派員赴敏體尼蔭路之屠宰場監督豬肉之批發以至於零售嚴格遵照官方之限價因此菜市場及肉店出售豬肉其價大跌</p>
<p>禁止掮客入屠宰場</p>
<p>據悉法租界警務當局自發覺本年八月二十七日豬肉限價規程因中間人之把持未能為全部豬肉店攤接受實行後原擬與中間商協商解決辦法屢試無效乃於本星期一二兩日早晨開始強硬行動禁止任何中間商或掮客進入敏體尼蔭路屠宰場以使豬肉直接由批發商按照介出售於另售店中此中間商遂無用武之地而價格亦不致抬高</p>
<p>分配數是均經核定</p>
<p>對分配給於肉店或肉攤之數量亦經核定其給配量以在未實行限價前該店攤日銷量為準為進一步編制計法捕房方面復嚴格調查肉店攤配得豬肉後是否依照很價出售一二日來此種分配制度進行尚稱順利據悉當局一時尚不容掮客復進入屠宰場而使批發商與另售商之間直接往來遵照限價買賣</p>
<p>黑市作崇殊堪髪指</p>
<p>昨據官方表示希望一般經紀人對當局之苦心加以諒解並希彼等服從命令尤其對於抑制食物價格一事　　一周中肉價雖曾限定為八元四角一磅惟仍被抬至十八元高價工部局衛生處長田代良佐並曾在其報告中透露因豬肉之缺乏公共租界曾有百分之八十肉攤停止營業惟據當局相信豬肉並不缺乏但為中間人操縱而被售於黑市而已公眾常在菜場或屠宰所獲得售完之通知但在同一地點卻可以高價購得豬肉至於工報局是否將採取與法當局相似方法排除中間人之出售豬肉下在商討</p>

<h3>智識青年偏難陳大獲訪問記（上）</h3>
<p>陳大濩近影</p>
<p>門外漢談戲是班門弄斧徒顯其拙所以不敢談亦不配談也平素從沒有寫過有關評劇的文字也從沒有和伶人有過交往自己雖然喜歡哼幾句也從不敢自稱為票友上海多的是票房多的是票友可是我都不相熟即如聽戲的次數也是得奶以對於京劇程度這樣幼身份證的我果然破例來批評由票友下海方於天蟾期滿輟演的陳大獲豈非笑話至少將被京劇同志認為是故意捧角或有之以一個受過新時代教育的青年曾經海軍學校縹業又曾肄業交通大學辦過交能運輸事業吃過銀行裹的金弄筆桿辦過雜誌（銀行生活）的陳大濩不慣等因奉此的磨折毅然決然憑他十餘年來玩要的經騐正式下海唱戲這與普通的伶入似乎有些不同吧所以我們對於陳大濩不能和一般角兒同樣看待這便是我樂於去訪問陳大濩和寫這篇東西的動機</p>
<p>杭州余叔巖像是揶揄像是雀揚的名稱是我去年在某一次慈善募捐播音從收音機裹初次聽得的陳大濩這個名字也就是從那次播音而知道可不知他是個怎樣的人從杭州余叔巖的稱呼上想他準是個杭州名也無疑的了當時聽他唱的一段什麼劇也忘懷了可是確有小余的韻味聽來非常甜潤悅耳從此對於杭州余叔巖陳大濩的印象非常深刻以後常注意陳大濩三個字可是從沒有在什麼票房裹或什麼地方彩排見過他的人想不到他最近突然在天蟾舞臺下海唱戲了這更引起了我的好奇心雖然我最不喜歡這個杭州余叔巖的尊稱反正這是人家給他的無謂的綽號與我的愛好全然兩事聽過他幾次戲後才知道他的藝術向晨普通票友可比確曾下過一番功夫受過名家指導即如京朝角兒亦難與比擬運腔使調咬字吐音處處顯出他是受過高深教育與戲劇修養極深的人</p>
<p>這次大濩決心下海最初接洽的戲院是黃金包銀相當大一切都已圓滿就是日期排在正當炎熱的暑天他怕受不了纔作罷論其次才接洽天蟾在談判時期天蟾當局答應將內部紛刷一新認椅全部換新但這倒不是大濩的本意大濩只要求班底必須整齊配角必須健全那知道除了物色著武生王金整點青衣李韻秋和票友張哲生的凈角外竟連裹子老生和青衣都沒有班底是糟得不堪於是牡丹雖好沒有綠葉扶持這使大濩是非常苦痛的事更以鼓手是王金整點帶來的打武場的工夫確很精但不諳文戲的路子這非特影響動作更影響到表情竟使他不敢多演文戲</p>
<p>更不幸的是第一天打泡空城計慢板後脫漏我面前缺少個知音的人一句被人引為笑話喧騰人口這固由於大濩之一時疏忽但據此而任意誹謗似非評劇者應有的態度蓋脫漏唱詞為一事藝術又一事也誠如鄭過宜君云臨場忘詞雖宿伶有時不免王又宸犯之尤數然未聞又緣是累及其羅嗦而大濩何得認此即為其前途榮辱所判斤斤於此以為祇訾大濩之具微特不足以使大濩心折而所見者小亦竊為筆者羞也</p>
<p>初次下海的票友竟以靠把戲長於文戲這是很奇突可貴的戰太平一劇眾口一詞讚為傑作上演多次無不滿座高音寬亮低音沉著咬字吐音個個珠玉叔巖韻味可稱克承衣缽待雲室劇話云余聆大濩之戰太平每逢翻高之腔極勝任愉快李少春此劇在後起中誠屬翹楚而歌喉之佳乃弗若大濩余十年來聆戰太平不為少矣然少春以次惟大濩為能愜余意於是知大濩確有所蓄也大眾的批評戰太平一劇在現時京朝角兒中李少春以武功見勝陳大以唱功佔優餘者卑卑不足道矣（待續）</p>

<p>小談</p>
<h3>燕子</h3>
<p>— 歐麗</p>
<p>幼時每當春天到來的時候總有一對燕子飛到我家的屋簷下來築窠</p>
<p>每當牠們飛來的時候我們全家大小莫不表示歡迎我們每天看牠們銜泥啣草忙碌地飛去飛來我們聽牠們呢喃對語我們等產生蛋孵雛我們聽見小燕子吱吱地亂叫我們看見牠們捕捉小蟲來飼小燕</p>
<p>小燕子長大了羽毛漸豐有一天早晨母燕忽然決定該是小燕子學飛的時候了</p>
<p>於是母燕反小燕推到窠緣上去小燕危顫顫地站立不穏母燕用嘴把小燕銜起扔在寬處小燕嚇得吱喳亂叫展開雙翼亂撲一陣跌在地上了於是母燕飛到地面上把小燕銜著順窠裹接著再把停下窠緣又把小燕扔下來再銜回回樣一推一扔一銜往復了幾十次小燕就會飛了</p>
<p>起初我地見母燕這樣似乎殘忍無情舉動覺得非常奇怪後來我逝是母燕給小燕的磨練這種磨練是純然出於愛心的沒有磨練也就不會有遠走高飛的一天</p>

<h3>仁術濟世</h3>
<p>— 蕓芝</p>
<p>跑出了醫科學校的大門以後似乎不好意思再向家裹伸手要錢便自己掛上一塊牌子想藉此餬口可是朋友們卻羣來相賀說你是懸壺濟世了</p>
<p>不錯古人說醫者仁術也既稱仁術還能不是濟世的嗎我雖想分辯但也只好默然不作聲了</p>
<p>大概古時候濟世是比較容易的三指把脈五指開方一點風寒藥也用不到幾十塊錢所以只要弄到一枝筆找著幾張紙便可以大濟其世了然而現在的我卻慚愧得很不要說根本談不上濟世即使就算是在濟世吧這個破濟之世範圍也是小得可憐的</p>
<p>一位當小學教員的朋友老陳跑來向我說聽說你在懸壺濟世了我也總算是這世的一分子今天請你濟一濟吧</p>
<p>我看他面黃肌瘦三分像人七分倒像解剖室裹的骷髏經過一番鄭重的診察覺得他的癥狀太像課本上的肺結核了我正色告訴他說</p>
<p>老陳我看你的身體需要長期的靜養並且還要極度注意營養最好多吃些牛奶魚肝油</p>
<p>我的話還沒說完老陳已經嗤的一聲苦笑出來</p>
<p>得得別說了這些我都知道要休養要吃魚肝油可是這一世的命太薄目等下一世看吧</p>
<p>第二天我給他送去了一磅魚肝油以盡朋友之誼這一于肝油在我是等和十個門診但它對老陳有什麼用呢區區一于肝油怎夠那些粉筆悄紅墨水泄不通頓吃</p>
<p>然而像老陳總還算是在被濟至少也可以算是在半被濟之列的可是那些工人那些苦力那些躺馬路的人們我俯首聽命　有眼看著他們被病魔呑噬醫學無論如何進步暫時對於他們是毫無裨益的有時候也頗想濟他們一下但是何來祖先多魚肝油於是他們便只好永遠做世外之人了</p>
<p>仁術濟世嗎只有那些有錢的老爺太太少爺小姐們才是眞正被濟到的一切現代最進步醫學都正在延長一部份人的罪惡的生命讓他們多蛀蝕一些這社會多戕害一些善良無辜的人</p>
<p>我們幾時才能使仁術眞眞濟世呢</p>

<h3>女人出路在那裹</h3>
<p>— 敏行</p>
<p>我是一個交通機關中的女職職們有一百多個女同事我們就職前都曾經過嚴格的考試就職與田賦事同樣地分派到各組們中間沒有花瓶也很少有塗奶油的我們的工作效力與田賦事無異道是無可否認的事實我們都目力生存並且還有負擔家庭的</p>
<p>戰爭的爆發使上海百業凋零了外洋的郵路斷絕了各地的交通阻隔了我們機關的營業收入銳減甚至員工的薪津也無法支付在這情形下似乎不得不裁員減薪了首先受影響的女職員理由是女人不需要負擔家庭女人出來工作是僅廠務戲了父兄的負擔可是我的父親已過世　了我沒有兄姊幼弟尚祇五齡如果我被裁了我一家的生活該叫方便來負擔呢已婚女職員的米貼也由一擔而減為半擔了理由是女人不需要負擔家庭更無需領一擔米去養活丈夫和孩子已婚的男同事的米貼依舊是一擔但是我的丈夫戰前是一家英商銀行的職員戰後是失業了我能因他失業而請求離婚嗎法律和人情能允許我我做嗎夫婦以互助為天責我能坐視他們餓死嗎可是封建思想牢不可破地印在上級人人腦海裹他不觀察社會的現狀他不怕做一個摧殘女工職業的罪魁雖然我們都站在正的立聲上力爭我們不願因此而影響到別的女子的職業</p>
<p>同樣是人以同等資格做同樣的工作可是女人就該先裁退所得的酬報女人又該少於男子一個錄用女職員已有址多年歷史的交通機關尚且如此女人不幸而身為女人請問女人的出路在那裹</p>

<h3>蟲茶</h3>
<p>— 洛干</p>
<p>在跟班秀一種蟲茶當本地人泡出來給外鄉人吃時他產時時會加上一聲推薦的我有一次吃到了一碗論色香味都還算不錯泡在碗裹的乃是小米一般的深綠色的東西在滾水中漸漸地演化很是別緻</p>
<p>我問主人蟲茶是什麼茶他說這是茶樹上的一種小硬殼蟲所排洩出來找東西因為這蟲是專吃嫩茶葉的而又經過了它的消化器官所以越是名貴</p>
<p>我聽了不禁駭了一跳這豈不是蟲污嗎別人排洩出來的東西誰能有胃口去消化呢可是主人說這年頭卻偏多吃污的人</p>

<h3>粉墨生溽</h3>
<p>— 梁燦</p>
<p>（四）吃一行·怨一行</p>
<p>從普通人看來做話劇演員眞是最適意的工作了只要把劇本背背熟豐挺漂亮的衣服在很美麗的佈景前面隨隨便便的走幾步路句話哭則聳幾下肩笑則哈哈幾聲好不容易如此不但有很大的薪水可拿而且名揚四海萬人傳說風頭不健僅交於電影明星想起來想不叫人羨慕其實這是一種表面的看法個中情形絕沒有這樣簡單</p>
<p>從前做一個職業劇團的基本演員味道總算不壞因為劇團少演員多一團之中演員足夠二三個戲之用所以演戲有之休息亦有之甚至於常常派不到腳色月月白拿薪水不過現在不同了劇團成立既多老演員究竟只有這些人馬分散一團之中演員既少排演員表時往往不轉普通的人差不多都是連著派到戲甲戲剛剛上演乙劇又已開排日夜兩場演劇之外還加上早晨排戲從早晨九十點鐘一直幹到夜晚十一時左右這樣一天工作幾乎十餘小時人非機械請問焉有不累之理並且以疲倦之身又碰著已經演了許多又膩又丈的戲戲演出的成績請問又焉能高明</p>
<p>身體的疲倦倒還不說心理的疲乏更不堪設相平常演那輕鬆的喜劇還好碰著那些沉悶的悲劇每場大哭大鬧五六次身體不強壯心理不健全者又怎麼能吃得住再說演戲之時他的情緒總是很緊張再加上戲中高潮一到劇中人或失敗或死亡這樣人生最大的痛苦普通人一生不過碰到一兩回可是演員就得設身處地一地每天遇見二次這樣地緊張下去演員們都慢慢　地憔翠起來了特別苦的是熱天演冷天戲或是古裝戲或是冷天演熱天戲演員往往因為身體不健壯前臺在上戲後臺預備打針俗話說頂石臼做戲吃力不討好如此演戲眞跟頂石臼差不了多少</p>
<p>此外因為排戲演戲時間不定常常影溶贈的吃飯所以患胃病的也特多再加上天天演戲時臉上按勞分配滿了油彩等所以演員的皮膚多數粗而且黃不堪近覩這種內化妝而得的壞處特別影響了女演員因為她們的青春在舞臺上消逝得更快了於是就不得不磨練演技以為永存之計可是天天忙碌又何來餘暇呢結果是蹉跎歲月眼看自己的聲名一天一天衰微下來這不能不說是話劇演演悲哀了</p>

<h3>Soviet Forces on the Don Front Attempt a Counter-Offensive to Relieve the Siege of Jess City; Heavy Rains Hamper Military Operations for Days</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Alliance News Agency)</p>
<p>According to news received here last night, the German Air Force continues to bomb the remaining Soviet strongholds in Stalingrad. However, ground military operations north of the city are limited to clearing out a few Red Army resistance points due to incessant heavy rain. At the same time, General Timoshenko's offensive from the northwest, between the Volga and Don rivers, aimed at relieving Stalingrad, is said to be losing steam.</p>
<p>Fuhrer's Headquarters, 21st (Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>Today's German military communique states that operations in western Caucasus were still affected by adverse weather conditions yesterday, but German forces, aided by the air force, continued to make progress. The battle for Stalingrad continues. German planes sank a freighter in the Volga River. Soviet forces between the Volga and Don rivers launched a feint attack after receiving reinforcements and tanks, but were repelled with heavy losses. An enemy attempt to cross the Don River was severely crushed and driven back by allied Italian and Romanian forces.</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>Military officials in Berlin stated that the adverse weather has not changed the overall trend of the Battle of Stalingrad. Continuous heavy rains have turned streets into canals. Only infantry are engaged in mop-up operations in the northern part of the city. German artillery continues to bombard Soviet artillery positions on both banks of the Volga River, while German planes provide air support. The Soviet forces now only hold a corner of the October Revolution Steel Factory and a section of the railway south of the factory. A formal offensive by German infantry in this area has not yet begun. Within the arms factory area in the north, which has been occupied by the German army, small pockets of residual enemy forces are occasionally found and captured. The battle for houses in the eastern part of the city is expanding. German infantry and engineers continue to occupy many houses. Due to the limited activity in the area, which makes target identification difficult, the Air Force has concentrated its bombing efforts on the October Revolution Steel Factory. German planes are also very active in the lower reaches of the Volga River. After the port facilities of Astrakhan and the stations along the coastal railway line were damaged, the Soviets have had to reroute transportation inland. Now, these secondary routes are also constantly being bombed by German planes. Soviet forces attempted to cross the Neva River at night in the Leningrad area but were repelled, and several Soviet boats were sunk. Soviet forces east and north of Smolensk planned to launch an offensive, but torrential rain caused many vehicles to become mired in mud, making them targets for German aircraft.</p>
<h3>Circumstances of Captured American Airmen Under Trial in Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Alliance News Agency)</p>
<p>According to official information obtained this afternoon, four American airmen captured by the Japanese military authorities during the American air raid on Tokyo on April 18 admitted during interrogation to bombing and strafing innocent civilians, school children, and non-military targets such as hospitals. The first of the four prisoners is Fero, 23 years old, a lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force from Carolina. This man embodies the spirit of the American air raid on Tokyo. During the interrogation, he told the Japanese authorities, "I saw schoolchildren playing near the school building and felt like letting them have a taste of bullets. So I flew straight down and opened fire with my machine gun. I am very sorry in my heart, but are they not the enemy's children?" The second is Holbrook, 27 years old, also a lieutenant in the Air Force from Texas. He stated that he was pursued by anti-aircraft fire and Japanese planes, and in his confusion, he wanted to escape to China. He dropped bombs on tall buildings without distinguishing the targets. "I really don't know if it is possible to avoid losses to innocent residents and houses during wartime." The other two, Tess Harts, 29, and Spice, 20, both confirmed that the U.S. Air Force deliberately bombed non-military targets, as announced by the Japanese authorities. Several captured American pilots have now been punished according to the announcement made by the Chief of the Army Press Section of the General Headquarters.</p>
<h3>Lin Baisheng Inspects Etajima Naval Academy</h3>
<p>Etajima, 21st (Alliance News Agency)</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Baisheng, Secretary-General of the New Sports Association, and his party visited the Etajima Naval Academy on the afternoon of the 21st. They departed from Kure Station for Shimonoseki at 3:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Representatives Attending Literary Congress Host Farewell Banquet Yesterday</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>As the representatives from various parts of our country who will be attending the East Asian Literary Congress are about to depart, the Publicity Department and the Japanese Embassy hosted a farewell banquet at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association last night (the 71st, or 21st). The banquet began with a speech by Guo, Deputy Director of the Publicity Department, followed by a farewell speech by Secretary Matsudaira. Zhou Huarun gave a reply on behalf of the representatives. The banquet concluded with great merriment around 10 PM.</p>

<h3>Three Major Changes in Naval Warfare; Britain Acknowledges Significant Losses; U.S. Combined Fleet Commander States Lack of Ability to Wage Simultaneous War in Two Oceans</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 21st (Alliance News Agency)</p>
<p>According to a London dispatch, British First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander admitted frankly yesterday in a speech in London that due to changes in naval warfare methods in this war, the British Navy's tasks have become increasingly difficult. Alexander first described the changes in naval warfare methods, stating that since the last war, three major changes have occurred that have threatened the British Empire's maritime communications. The first change is the increased radius of action and the attack power of the Air Force. The second is the increased range and performance of submarines. The third is that naval mine warfare tactics have undergone a transformation with the introduction of magnetic mines, acoustic mines, and other sea mines that can be laid from the air. The British Navy must use all its strength to counter these new tactics in order to maintain the British Empire's maritime communication lines, because the damage to ships and soldiers caused by these new tactics is exceptionally great compared to the last war, Alexander said. Alexander further cited the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, pointing out that the strategy in East Asia must also be changed accordingly and demanded that the sea nation be revitalized.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 20th (Alliance News Agency)</p>

<p>Lisbon, 20th (Alliance News Agency)</p>
<p>The Xinyang Star Evening News on the 20th published an article by military commentator General Henderson, stating that a new military transportation route across the North African continent would not only avoid the threat of Japanese submarines in the Indian Ocean, but also play a very important role in the African theater. The main content is that the construction of two military highways that run from the Gulf of Guinea across the central part of the African continent to North Africa has been completed. The importance of this highway has increased with the recent deployment of American forces to Liberia. The route is 3,200 kilometers long and is the only shortcut for transporting military supplies from the west coast of Africa to Egypt. Therefore, the transportation route around the Cape of Good Hope, which is more than 10,000 kilometers long, is no longer needed and is no longer subject to the threat of Japanese submarines in the Indian Ocean. It is expected that Hitler will have the flexibility to attack the Suez Canal by land and sea this winter, which will be a decisive factor in expelling the Axis forces from the Mediterranean.</p>

<h3>Chilean Cabinet Resigns</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 20th (Alliance News Agency)</p>
<p>According to a dispatch from Santiago, the Chilean Cabinet resigned en masse on the 20th. The reason is unknown, but it is expected that President Rios was dissatisfied with U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles' criticism, which led to the suspension of the visit to Washington. As a result, the Cabinet's foreign policy opinions were inconsistent, leading to the resignation. According to a New York dispatch, the U.S. side believes that the Chilean Cabinet's resignation is due to the crisis between the U.S. and Chile intensifying after President Rios' statement regarding Welles' speech, so it will take this opportunity to revise its foreign policy.</p>
<p>Santiago, 21st (Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>The Cabinet has tendered its resignation to President Rivers last night. The letter of resignation stated that officials felt that the current political situation was delicate and therefore requested resignation so that Your Majesty could conveniently resolve the dispute. The president immediately asked the ministers to continue to govern as usual until the cabinet issue was resolved. According to Interior Minister Bello Talamie, the cabinet issue can be resolved within 48 hours. According to general belief, the President will accept the resignation. At the same time, according to reports, the Cabinet's resignation was a direct result of the U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles' speech criticizing Chile's neutral attitude.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 20th (Alliance News Agency)</p>
<p>The Chilean government has resolutely resisted the U.S. Western Hemisphere policy in the past and has strictly maintained neutrality in this war. The news of the country's Cabinet's mass resignation has caused a major shock to the political circles of the American countries. No information is currently available to make a clear judgment on the future direction of the Chilean government's foreign policy. However, it is well known that the Chilean Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and others openly oppose Foreign Minister Herba's foreign policy and demand the Foreign Minister's resignation on a common front. It is inevitable that President Rios will revise his foreign policy at this time of cabinet change. According to U.S. sources, the resignation of the Chilean Cabinet reflects the domestic political instability in that country. It is said that rumors are rampant in Chile, and the public is holding meetings advocating the severance of diplomatic relations with the Axis powers. It is also reported that the Chilean government arrested five Axis nationals on the 19th to prevent espionage activities, but the truth of the matter is still impossible to determine based on the information obtained by the United States.</p>

<p>Havas News Agency, 20th</p>
<p>Government leader Laval delivered a national broadcast at 8 PM today, advising French workers to consider the difficult situation the country is in and to jointly respond to the government's call to go to work in Germany. He stated that months ago, he had requested everyone to go to work in Germany. Today, he wished to reiterate his appeal made on June 22 of this year. Germany is currently engaged in a large-scale war, forcing it to obtain all resources from various parts of Europe. Consequently, it has issued decrees mobilizing the labor force of various occupied European countries. He then negotiated with the German authorities in the occupied territories, and finally obtained the German side's assurance that if the promises previously made by France could be fulfilled, this decree would no longer be implemented in France. Today, France's highest interest requires France to promote a policy of understanding with Germany. France will always be Germany's neighbor. If a firm agreement cannot be established between France and Germany, war between the two countries cannot be avoided. This is an immutable argument. Now, the agreement negotiated between the French government and the German authorities in the occupied territories has been accepted after careful consideration. Each factory must extract a certain number of workers to be sent to work in Germany, but this method will not hinder the factory's work and will prevent the workers remaining in France from becoming unemployed. The French government has taken into account each worker's family situation, age, and military service before sending them to Germany, and guarantees that they will receive the highest salaries and allowances. They will be organized into teams with their original engineers and supervisors so that the factory authorities and the workers working in Germany can maintain contact. The agreement he signed with the German authorities is of great benefit to French prisoners of war. One of the achievements is that the severe measures taken by Germany against French prisoners of war have been lifted. As for him personally, for the past two years, he has never forgotten the 1.2 million French prisoners. They originally had to wait for the end of the war to regain their freedom, but after his extensive negotiations with the German side, a new approach has now been decided. The German side has notified him that if France can send 100,000 skilled workers to work in Germany, the families of French prisoners of war can go to the detention camps to meet and live with their husbands. He knows that French workers love freedom and independence, but if we can choose the path to save the country with courage and intelligence, isn't that a clear sign of freedom and independence? He sincerely hopes that everyone will continue to work hard and not be discouraged, and hopes that the wives and children of those who have stopped flying and are French prisoners of war earnestly hope to reunite with their fathers or husbands and resolutely complete their mission. In the future, they will surely be grateful for everyone's kindness. For everyone's sake, there are currently only two options: One is to voluntarily register for service, which will not only provide material benefits but also benefit the country and fellow citizens. Otherwise, they will be forced to work for Germany, which will not only humiliate themselves but also humiliate the country, while benefiting Germany instead. He is confident that what he has done is to do his best to protect the interests of everyone, the prisoners of war, and the country. He hopes that everyone will share the same feelings as him. The greatness of France's future depends on everyone. In short, everyone is holding tools today and will recover what France lost in the war. For the sake of yourselves, the prisoners of war, and the country, everyone must obey the government's orders. He sincerely hopes that everyone will understand these words well.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Vichy, 20th</p>
<p>The newspapers in Paris and various occupied areas today all published on the front page a statement issued by the German authorities, explaining their views on the issue of recruiting French workers. It stated that every Frenchman has a moral obligation to work in Germany, and that doing so would not only fulfill their duty to France and the entire Europe but also enable France to obtain substantial benefits. Only by accepting this call can France escape painful military measures, and only by cooperating with Germany can France avoid new disasters. The statement finally listed the various benefits that workers going to Germany could enjoy.</p>

<h3>Dakar is Peaceful, American Troops Continue to Land in Liberia, West Africa</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Vichy, 21st</p>
<p>A telegram from French West Africa yesterday stated that the situation in Dakar is peaceful. According to well-informed sources here, the French government is well aware of the threat to French West Africa, but according to the armistice agreement, France has the freedom to defend its colonies.</p>
<p>Allied News Agency, Lisbon, 20th</p>
<p>According to sources arriving here, American troops continue to land in Liberia, West Africa. It is rumored that the supreme command of the US expeditionary force in Africa will be established in Liberia or the Belgian Congo.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Rome, 21st</p>
<p>Colonial and military circles here believe that the landing of American troops in Liberia is not important because Liberia is not a suitable base for launching an offensive in Africa. Liberia has no good ports to accommodate giant ships transporting troops and war materials, nor does it have roads leading to the interior for military use. Furthermore, Liberia has a harsh climate and is not suitable for habitation, let alone military operations. Therefore, the occupation of Liberia by American troops has no other important significance other than strengthening coastal patrols to protect Freetown.</p>

<h3>More Than 300,000 Bags of Sugar in Storage, Strict Investigation of Sugar Merchants Profiteering and Selling at Black Market Prices, Allotment to be Suspended, Serious Cases May Result in Suspension of Business</h3>
<p>Regarding the sugar issue in Shanghai, which has recently attracted much attention, although there are various rumors, there is in fact no reason to form panic or unease. According to this reporter's inquiry from the Shanghai Sugar Merchant Cooperative yesterday, the city's sugar inventory is still more than 200,000 bags, and more than 100,000 bags have recently arrived. Based on a monthly consumption of 20,000 bags, the combined inventory of new goods can meet the needs of Shanghai for at least one year. In terms of distribution, the cooperative allots an appropriate amount of sugar to the wholesale sugar stores on a monthly basis, which in turn distribute it to designated registered retail sugar stores within their respective districts. The October allotment has begun yesterday, and the sugar stores and retail stores are busy receiving goods in order to sell them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Retail and Wholesale Sugar Allotment Procedures</p>
<p>There are more than 1,100 sugar retail stores registered with the Sugar Industry Cooperative, divided into types A and B. Type A retail merchants specialize in direct retail sales. Type B retail merchants include candy stores, etc. All retail merchants apply for registration with the Sugar Industry Cooperative, and are approved for registration after verification by the cooperative, and a registration certificate is issued. Based on the registration certificate, they collect the application form, fill in the required sugar for the next month on the purchase request, pay a 20% deposit, and apply to the cooperative for purchase. After the cooperative's overall verification and allotment, a purchase certificate is issued. The retail merchant then prepares the payment and presents the certificate to purchase from the designated sugar store between the 5th and 20th of the month. There are 58 wholesale sugar stores registered with the cooperative. After the cooperative's overall verification and allotment, a notification is issued. After receiving the notification, the sugar store fills out a delivery slip, together with the payment and a 20% deposit, and purchases from the cooperative. After the sugar store obtains the sugar, the cooperative sends a delivery clerk to monitor the weighing together, and then sells the sugar to the retail merchants between the 5th and 20th of the month according to the cooperative's instructions. The above-mentioned deadline of the 5th to the 20th is the principle, but sometimes it may be earlier or later.</p>
<p>Ordered to Suppress the Sugar Black Market</p>
<p>The Sugar Industry Cooperative has recently received reports of black market prices in the sugar market. The reason is that type B retail merchants openly use the name of making candy to disguisedly convert the form of sugar and smuggle it for export, while some type A retail merchants knowingly resell it to type B retail merchants, or privately sell it in large quantities to rural farmers for sale in western township stores. If the black market price is paid, they are willing to sell more. After the authorities instructed, regardless of type A or B, if the behavior of the market is detected again, the sugar store involved will be permanently suspended from sugar allotment, and will be subject to suspension of business and severe punishment depending on the circumstances. The cooperative also issued regulations according to the authorities' intention that the sugar content of the candy produced by each candy factory and sold in Shanghai may not exceed 50%, and that sold outside Shanghai may not exceed 30%. In addition to strictly preventing profiteering behavior in the sugar market in accordance with the authorities' orders, the cooperative, in order to maintain legitimate business, has repeatedly discussed the following adjustment methods for each retail merchant after repeated deliberation by the board of directors:</p>
<p>Retail Sales Limited to Legitimate Households</p>

<h3>General Report on Air Defense Drills in the French Concession (V)</h3>
<p>The alarm is issued when enemy aircraft are heading towards Shanghai from a distance. During the alarm period, all activities in the city should continue normally, but the amount of light leaking into the sky must be absolutely minimized to avoid temporary panic. Therefore, lights must be carefully covered, and the windows of roads, gardens, and courtyards must be covered with dark light-blocking materials. During the alarm, vehicle traffic on the roads is not prohibited, but street lights are reduced to a minimum. Everyone should strictly comply with Notice No. 9 issued by the French authorities on September 26 of this year. The important points are described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding automobiles, trams, and trackless trams (except for vehicles from the police department, fire department, and military camps), the speed should not exceed 18 kilometers per hour. When approaching intersections, they must not turn around or exceed the vehicles in front of them, and must not use horns or other alarm devices unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding pedestrians, they must not stay or wander on the roads, and should walk on the sidewalks on the left side of the road. They must not cross the road except at designated pedestrian crossings. They must not use flashlights, except for those with glass lenses painted dark yellow or wrapped in dark yellow cloth or paper.</p>
<p>As for the air raid drill, it is issued when enemy aircraft are flying near Shanghai and not far from the city. At this time, street lights should be turned off immediately and traffic should be completely cut off except for ambulances.</p>
<p>Everyone should be familiar with the air raid drill siren signal:</p>
<p>Alarm siren: one sound for 30 seconds</p>
<p>Alarm complete siren: two sounds, 20 seconds each</p>
<p>Air raid siren: multiple sounds, 5 seconds each. End of air raid (alarm continues): one siren for 30 seconds (same as alarm)</p>
<p>The public must pay attention to the possibility of an air raid following the alarm, and an alarm usually follows the air raid (end of air raid and). The start of the alarm is a siren of one sound (30 seconds), so everyone must remember that only two consecutive sirens 20 seconds long indicate the end of the drill and the restoration of the original state. In the next few weeks, the French Concession will continue to carry out lighting drills. The drills may be carried out in sections (each Lianbao) in order to inspect the air defense equipment in the concession, but will not be notified in advance, so residents should try to complete them as soon as possible.

<h3>Yan Xia Qi Talks Business (1) Stray Tales of Opium Prohibition in the Qing Dynasty</h3>
<p>— Edited by Huisheng</p>
<p>Opium addiction in China is a major disaster for the nation. In the middle of the Guangxu period, an edict was issued to prohibit opium, especially strict for officials. At that time, Wang Zhongkai, the magistrate of Jingzhou, was also an opium addict. He was unwilling to endure the humiliation of investigation, so he closed his door and quit smoking by force. After three days of pain, he jumped out of the sea of ​​suffering. Unfortunately, he was over fifty years old and his energy had declined. He died of dysentery due to opium poisoning. The Qing court praised his ambition and gave him generous pensions and extreme mourning. Those who quit smoking should first remove the accumulated toxins. If the toxins are not removed, they will not be able to sleep peacefully even if they quit. Now there is chlorophyll, a new medicine for quitting smoking. It extracts the natural ingredients that eliminate toxins from the Changchun leaves of Songyuan. Taking it will excrete opium toxins in the second stool, which is very thorough. Many people have quit opium and heroin without feeling pain or affecting work. The Wanguo Pharmacy Company in Tianlun Building, Paoqiu Field, Nanjing Road, sells each box for 20 yuan, telephone 94078.</p>

<h3>The French Concession Limits Meat Prices and Has Taken Compulsory Action, Brokers Disrupt the Market and Repeated Advice Has Been Ineffective, So Only Direct Buying and Selling Can Prohibit Transfer</h3>
<p>In the past week, the price of pork in the French Concession has been much higher than the limit price due to the manipulation and profiteering of various brokers and middlemen. The police authorities first tolerated and hoped that the speculators would realize it in time, but in fact the situation deteriorated day by day. Therefore, drastic action was taken a few days ago, and personnel were sent to the slaughterhouse on Mintini Yin Road to supervise the wholesale and retail of pork, strictly in accordance with the official limit price. Therefore, the price of pork sold in vegetable markets and meat stores has plummeted.</p>
<p>Brokers Prohibited from Entering Slaughterhouse</p>
<p>It is reported that the French Concession police authorities, since discovering that the pork limit price regulation on August 27 of this year has not been accepted and implemented by all pork stores due to the control of middlemen, originally intended to negotiate with middlemen to solve the problem, but repeated attempts failed. Therefore, on the mornings of Monday and Tuesday of this week, strong action was taken to prohibit any middlemen or brokers from entering the Mintini Yin Road slaughterhouse so that pork could be directly sold by wholesalers to retail stores at the market price. These middlemen have no use, and the price will not be raised.</p>
<p>The Number of Distributions Has Been Verified</p>
<p>The number of allocations given to meat stores or meat stalls has also been verified. The amount given is based on the daily sales volume of the store before the implementation of the limit price. In order to further compile the calculation method, the police station has also strictly investigated whether the meat stores sell pork according to the current price after obtaining the distribution. This distribution system has been proceeding smoothly for the past one or two days. It is reported that the authorities will not allow brokers to re-enter the slaughterhouse for the time being, but will allow direct transactions between wholesalers and retailers in accordance with the limit price.</p>
<p>The Rampant Black Market is Extremely Outrageous</p>
<p>Yesterday, officials expressed the hope that the general agents would understand the authorities' good intentions and hoped that they would obey orders, especially regarding the suppression of food prices. Although the meat price was limited to 8.4 yuan per pound in one week, it was still raised to a high price of 18 yuan. The head of the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department, Toshiro Tashiro, also revealed in his report that 80% of meat stalls in the Public Concession had stopped operating due to the shortage of pork. However, the authorities believe that pork is not in short supply, but is being manipulated by middlemen and sold on the black market. The public often receives a notice of being sold out in the vegetable market or slaughterhouse, but pork can be purchased at a high price in the same location. It is being discussed whether the Shanghai Municipal Council will take a similar approach to the French authorities to eliminate the sale of pork by middlemen.</p>
<h3>Li Liansheng Murder Case, Relatives of the Deceased Arrested</h3>
<p>Li Liansheng, a former detective in the French police's gambling squad, had tens of thousands of dollars in savings due to his work. He lived at No. 13, Lane 987, Xiafei Road, which was his own property, and had several properties. He was enjoying his leisurely years when, unexpectedly, at 6 a.m. on April 22, 1939, Li had not yet gotten up when he was suddenly broken into by thugs who hacked Li to death with an axe. He was 48 years old at the time. It has been three and a half years since then, and the murderer has not yet been caught. It is now reported that the chief instigator in this case is actually the deceased's wife, Li Jiang (i.e., Jiang Wenzhen, 35 years old, a local, currently runs the Mao Da Ni Rong Store at No. 808, Xiafei Road). Detective Zhou reported this to the Western Detective Chief, who led the human body detectives to the Mao Da Store yesterday and arrested Jiang Wenzhen, as well as accomplice Jiang Baiming (i.e., Jiang's younger brother, 29 years old, the accountant of Mao Da) and related person Qian Guanhua (30 years old, a local, the general manager of Mao Da), Zhang Hankai, 26 years old, from Pinghu, who lives at No. 42, Lane 36, Dixifeier Road, Zhang Ashang, 56 years old, who lives at No. 8, Ningguo Road, a small foreman of the Shanghai Textile Factory, and six or seven other people were taken to the police station.

<h3>A Visit to the Talented Young Man, Chen Dahuo (Part 1)</h3>
<p>Recent photo of Chen Dahuo</p>
<p>It is presumptuous for an outsider to talk about opera, only revealing their ignorance. Therefore, I dare not talk about it, nor am I qualified to talk about it. I have never written about Peking opera before, nor have I ever had contact with actors. Although I like to hum a few tunes, I would never dare to call myself an amateur. There are many amateur opera troupes and many amateur enthusiasts in Shanghai, but I am not familiar with any of them. Even the number of times I have seen operas is so few that my understanding of Peking opera is at the level of an infant's identity card. So, for me to make an exception and criticize Chen Dahuo, who left the amateur stage to become a professional and whose contract at the Tianchan Theater has expired, would be ridiculous, to say the least. At least, Peking opera colleagues will think that I am deliberately promoting the performer. Chen Dahuo, a young man who has received a modern education, graduated from the Naval Academy, studied at Jiaotong University, ran a transportation business, and worked in a bank (Bank Life) as a writer, was unwilling to endure the constraints of office work. He resolutely decided to rely on his experience of playing opera for more than ten years to formally become a professional actor. This seems somewhat different from ordinary actors, so we cannot treat Chen Dahuo in the same way as other performers. This is why I am happy to visit Chen Dahuo and write this article.</p>
<p>"Hangzhou Yu Shuyan" - a name that is both teasing and praise - was the first time I heard Chen Dahuo's name last year on the radio during a charity fundraising broadcast. It was from that broadcast that I knew of him, but I didn't know what kind of person he was. From the name "Hangzhou Yu Shuyan," I thought he must be a famous figure from Hangzhou. I have forgotten what opera he sang at the time, but it certainly had the charm of Little Yu, and it sounded very sweet and pleasant. Since then, the impression of "Hangzhou Yu Shuyan Chen Dahuo" has been very deep. Afterwards, I often paid attention to the name Chen Dahuo, but I never saw him at any amateur opera troupes or rehearsals. I never expected that he would suddenly become a professional actor on the stage of the Tianchan Theater. This aroused my curiosity even more. Although I don't like the title "Hangzhou Yu Shuyan" very much, it is just a nickname given to him by others and has nothing to do with my preferences. After listening to his operas several times, I realized that his art is comparable to ordinary amateurs and he has indeed worked hard and received guidance from famous teachers. Even Peking opera actors in the capital city are hard to compare with him. His singing, pronunciation, and enunciation all reveal that he has received a high level of education and profound dramatic cultivation.</p>
<p>When Dahuo decided to become a professional actor, the first theater he contacted was the Golden Theater, and the financial terms were very good. Everything was satisfactory, but the dates were scheduled during the hot summer months, and he was afraid he wouldn't be able to handle it, so he gave up. The second theater he contacted was the Tianchan Theater. During the negotiations, the Tianchan Theater promised to renovate the interior and replace all the seats, but this was not Dahuo's intention. Dahuo only requested that the supporting cast be complete and the supporting actors be sound. But apart from finding the martial artist Wang Jinzheng, the female lead Li Yunqiu, and the amateur Zhang Zhesheng for the role of the supporting male, there were no supporting male or female roles at all. The supporting cast was terrible, so even though the peony was beautiful, there were no green leaves to support it, which made Dahuo very distressed. Furthermore, the drummer was brought by Wang Jinzheng, and his skills in martial arts were indeed very good, but he was unfamiliar with the routines of civil plays, which not only affected the movements but also affected the expressions, making him afraid to perform civil plays.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, on the first day, during the slow tempo aria of "Empty City Stratagem," he omitted the line "I lack a confidant in front of me," which was ridiculed and became a topic of gossip. This was indeed due to Dahuo's momentary negligence, but to arbitrarily slander him based on this is not the attitude that Peking opera enthusiasts should have. Forgetting a line is one thing, and art is another. As Zheng Guoyi said, "Even veteran actors sometimes make mistakes and forget lines. Wang Youchen has also made mistakes many times, but I have never heard of it affecting his performance." So, why should Dahuo consider this a judgment of his future honor and disgrace and be so fixated on it? To criticize Dahuo for this trivial matter is not enough to impress Dahuo, and the perspective is narrow. I am also ashamed for the author.</p>
<p>It is very unusual and commendable for an amateur actor making his debut to be better at martial arts than civil plays. The play "Battle of Taiping" was unanimously praised as a masterpiece. It was performed many times and was always full. The high notes were bright and the low notes were deep. The pronunciation and enunciation were all like pearls and jade. He can be said to have inherited the style of Yu Shuyan. As Dai Yunshi said in his "Drama Talk," "I listened to Dahuo's 'Battle of Taiping,' and he performed the high notes very well. Li Shaochun is indeed outstanding among the younger generation in this play, but his singing is not as good as Dahuo's. I have listened to 'Battle of Taiping' many times in the past ten years, and only Dahuo has been able to satisfy me after Shaochun. From this, I know that Dahuo has indeed accumulated a lot of experience." The public's criticism of the play "Battle of Taiping" is that among the current Peking opera actors, Li Shaochun is better at martial arts, and Chen Dahuo is better at singing, and the rest are insignificant.

<h3>Today's Chinese Stock Market Seems Like a Favored Child, Market Sentiment Keeps Rising, Strategic Wheel Turns East to West</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rise of Chinese stocks continued, attracting new investments regardless of high prices. Stockholders were observing and holding their positions, causing the market to rise higher and higher. Moreover, the trading of Chinese stocks had a "wheel war" pattern. Today, the public utility stocks were heavily bought based on rumors, and tomorrow the focus shifted to cultural stocks, hoping to attack commercial stocks. As for textile stocks, the best performers were either cotton mills or woolen mills, as if there were a path to follow when entering and exiting the beach. Newly established companies were even more cunning, promising to underwrite all the shares and refusing to share them with others, as if they were holding a piece of meat that no one could touch, causing those with a passion for stocks to drool. The more they said it was underwritten, the more people wanted to buy it, so the black market opened up. Whether the business was done, whether the stocks were issued, and whether the capital was paid up was only known to heaven. However, the stocks had already risen by 40% to 50%, allowing people to enjoy the fame of directors and supervisors without spending a penny, and to accumulate endless wealth. Nothing in the world is better than this in terms of gaining both fame and fortune. Moreover, after selling the stocks, they could proceed to other areas. Continuing to develop in this way would quickly create a class of millionaires. Because of this, the Chinese stock market was combining "good looks" with old and new preferences, simply moving money around and betting high and low like gamblers. Thus, investors were active, speculators had opportunities, and the market was even more lively. Yesterday, the market saw unprecedented new highs, and everyone was exceptionally optimistic. The stock of Meilun Woolen, which had only been listed for three days, led the way, soaring to a high of 17 yuan. Shanghai Cotton Textile also rose by 5 jiao, Innerwear added 2 jiao 5 fen, and Fuchang Dyeing &amp; Weaving, Xinfu Spinning, and South India Dyeing were all around 24 yuan. Great China Weaving was at 12.25 yuan, Hong Sheng was at 12.5 yuan, and Meiya Silk Factory rose by another 4 yuan. Wing On Textile was down 5 yuan. In the department store sector, Chinese goods suddenly had buyers at 120 yuan, Wing On Company reached 125 yuan, and Sincere was at 135.4 yuan. The buying sentiment for new pharmaceuticals was even stronger, with New Asia rising to a high of 54 yuan. Finally, it was at 52 yuan and then rose another 1.5 jiao. Sino-French added 3 yuan. Minyi had news of a capital increase. Great Five Yuan was around 5 yuan, and China United Films was around 42 yuan.

<h3>Public Bonds Fluctuated Moderately, 96 Continued to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the over-the-counter market for public bonds was slightly weak, and the high-low range was also smaller. The buying interest was slightly weak, but there was no pressure from the sellers. The industry was slightly conservative. However, Category D once saw a new high of 63.2 jiao. Although the closing price was slightly lower, it can also be seen that people were optimistic. Because the price of Category D is the lowest among the five types of public bonds, it is also attracting the attention of small investors. The trend of large declines and small rebounds is also expected. Observing the continued rise of 96 can also be used as an example. Yesterday, Category C initially opened at 7 yuan and 5 jiao when Hongxing bought in, but then saw a slight decline. After seeing a low price of 6 yuan, it rebounded to 6 yuan and 8 jiao. As a result, other bonds also declined slightly. The overall result was a small rebound of 4 jiao to 9 jiao. Only 96 continued to rise by 3 jiao. The turnover was about 2.5 million yuan. The list is as follows:</p>
<p>Category High Low Closing Change from Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A 65.60 64.80 65.40 Down 0.40</p>
<p>Unified B 65.00 63.80 64.30 Down 0.70</p>
<p>Unified C 67.50 66.00 66.80 Down 0.90</p>
<p>Unified D 63.20 60.80 62.20 Down 0.40</p>
<p>Unified E 64.20 61.90 64.00 Down 0.40</p>
<p>96 13.50 12.50 11.80 Up 0.30</p>
<h3>Cloth Market Still Firm Downstream</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market sentiment turned weak due to the decline in Eastern cloth, but the chips for imperial coarse cloth were still tight. 16-pound Earth was at 199 yuan, and Flying Hong was at 196 yuan, and they were unwilling to see a small decline. Fine cloth fell slightly. 12-pound Earth was sold at 110 yuan, Dapeng Old Single was at 163 yuan, and Fugui was at 160 yuan. Fugui Bank Single was at 157 yuan, which was a drop of 1.2 yuan per piece. Peach Blossom Lady Silk was at 253.5 yuan at the beginning of the morning session, but fell to 252 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, it turned firm again to 252.5 yuan, a drop of 2.5 yuan to 3 yuan. But Chick Silk was still asking for 249 yuan and was still not relaxed.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday, due to the decline in the yarn market, retail investors were eager to sell, and various cloths continued to decline. The Four Gentlemen Biji and Red Single were particularly weak. The opening price was 7.1 jiao, but it fell to 7.03 jiao, a large drop of 1.67 jiao. The last price for Dragon Head Fine Cloth New Single was even lower at 176 yuan, a drop of about 4 yuan per piece. However, the middle-grade fine cloth was still firm despite the weakness. For example, Lucky Ball Fine Cloth was at 166.5 jiao, Flying Fish was at 165.5 jiao, Yangsu Host was at 164 jiao, and Trumpet was at 163 jiao, a drop of only 1.5 jiao per piece. Therefore, the market trend is still easy to rise and difficult to fall.</p>
<h3>Coarse Grains Have Active Outlets</h3>
<p>Corn had good real demand, but the supply was limited, and the market was very tight. Yesterday, the opening price for Wuhu corn was 2 cars, with delivery in Shanghai West at 138 yuan to 140 yuan, and delivery in Pudong at 132.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Soybean cake trading was still active, and the willingness to sell was quite limited. The price saw a gradual increase. Yesterday, the opening price for Changji soybean cake was 1,000 pieces at 68 yuan. The spot price for Yuanlong soybean cake was 4 cars at 69 yuan, and the futures price was 70 yuan.</p>
<h3>Jewelry Market Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the city's jewelry industry's Daxin and other peers' jewelry gold door market still listed the exchange rate at 2,550 yuan per tael, unchanged (buying back reduced by more than 300 yuan). The inter-industry trading price continued to fall to within 2,300 yuan, and the internal agricultural sector was 15 yuan lower, totaling 2,320 yuan. The market was weak and, in a unanimous selling trend, it fell another 50 yuan to 2,270 yuan. The noon price was 2,275 yuan, 60 yuan less than the previous day, with a difference of 50 yuan. The transaction was rare. Jewelry silver was still listed at 14 yuan per tael, and the inter-industry trading price was still at 13.3 yuan. The money industry association's lending rate was unchanged at 1.4 jiao.</p>
<p>The Japanese military notes have stabilized. The inter-industry trading price is 5 yuan 5 jiao 5 fen 57 li. Silver shops and small money changers sell at 5 yuan 5 jiao 6 fen and buy back at 5 fen, it is said.</p>
<h3>Commercial Briefs</h3>
<p>Ningzi Dried Returns to Rise Again</p>
<p>Ningbo dried mussels have recently seen a limited source, and the market has risen again. For example, the asking price for Ningzi Dried has risen by 300 yuan, and the asking price for Sanzi Gong has risen by 200 yuan. The increase in Yuan Dried is similar. Dong Dried is sold for 3,200 yuan, and Western Middle Dried is cheaper, selling for 1,400 yuan.</p>
<p>Longkou Noodles Rise Unabated</p>
<p>Longkou vermicelli is highly favored by the industry, and the rising trend is relentless, so the owners' asking price is also tightening and less is being sold. Yesterday, the market called for another increase of 100 yuan, and the industry's bid was not far off, and there was a possibility of a deal being made.</p>
<p>White Pepper Follows Black Pepper in Rise</p>
<p>Ordinary white pepper was previously sold for around 1,000 yuan due to the small amount of sales. Now that black pepper has risen, although this item is rarely consumed, the price has also risen accordingly. Yesterday, the market called for an increase of 200 to 300 yuan, which is still being held.</p>

<h3>Swallows</h3>
<p>— Ou Li</p>
<p>In my childhood, every time spring came, a pair of swallows would fly to the eaves of my house to build a nest.</p>
<p>Every time they flew in, all of us in the family would welcome them. We watched them carry mud and grass, flying back and forth busily. We listened to them murmur to each other. We waited for them to lay eggs and hatch chicks. We heard the little swallows chirping noisily. We watched them catch insects to feed the little swallows.</p>
<p>The little swallows grew up and their feathers gradually became full. One morning, the mother swallow suddenly decided it was time for the little swallows to learn to fly.</p>
<p>So the mother swallow pushed the little swallows to the edge of the nest. The little swallows stood precariously, unsteadily. The mother swallow picked up the little swallows in her beak and threw them into a wide space. The little swallows, frightened, chirped and flapped their wings frantically, then fell to the ground. So the mother swallow flew to the ground, picked up the little swallows in her beak, put them back in the nest, and then put them on the edge of the nest again and threw the little swallows down again, picking them up again. The mother swallow pushed, threw, and picked up the little swallows back and forth dozens of times, and then the little swallows could fly.</p>
<p>At first, when we saw the mother swallow doing this seemingly cruel and heartless act, we felt very strange. Later, we realized that it was the mother swallow giving the little swallows a kind of training. This kind of training was purely out of love. Without training, there would be no chance to fly far and high one day.</p>

<h3>Benevolent Art Saves the World</h3>
<p>— Yun Zhi</p>
<p>After running out of the medical school, I felt embarrassed to ask my family for money again, so I hung up a sign myself, hoping to make a living from it. But my friends came to congratulate me, saying that I was hanging up a pot to save the world.</p>
<p>That's right, the ancients said that medicine is a benevolent art. Since it is called a benevolent art, can it not save the world? Although I wanted to argue, I had to remain silent.</p>
<p>Probably saving the world was easier in ancient times. Three fingers took the pulse, five fingers wrote the prescription, and a bit of wind and cold medicine didn't even cost dozens of dollars. So, as long as you could get a pen and find a few pieces of paper, you could save the world. However, I am very ashamed now. Don't even talk about saving the world at all. Even if I was saving the world, the scope of this broken world I was saving would be too small.</p>
<p>A friend, Lao Chen, who is a primary school teacher, ran to me and said, "I heard that you are hanging up a pot to save the world. I am also a member of this world. Please save me today."</p>
<p>I looked at him. His face was yellow and skinny, three points like a person, and seven points like a skeleton in the dissection room. After a solemn examination, I felt that his symptoms were too much like tuberculosis in the textbook. I told him seriously, "Lao Chen, I think your body needs long-term rest and extreme attention to nutrition. It is best to eat more milk and cod liver oil."</p>
<p>Before I could finish speaking, Lao Chen gave a bitter laugh.</p>
<p>"Okay, okay, don't say anymore. I know all this. I need to rest and eat cod liver oil, but this world has too thin a life. Let's wait for the next life and see."</p>
<p>The next day, I sent him a pound of cod liver oil to fulfill my friendship. This pound of cod liver oil is equivalent to ten outpatient visits for me, but what use is it to Lao Chen? How can a mere pound of cod liver oil be enough to eat away at by those chalk dusts and red ink that cannot be drained?</p>
<p>However, Lao Chen is still considered to be saved, at least he can be considered to be half saved. But what about those workers, those coolies, those people lying on the road? I bow my head and listen, and have eyes to see them being swallowed by disease. No matter how advanced medicine is, it is of no benefit to them for the time being. Sometimes I really want to save them, but where can I get more cod liver oil from my ancestors? So they can only be outcasts forever.</p>
<p>Is benevolent art saving the world? Only those rich old men, wives, young masters, and young ladies are truly being saved by everything that the most advanced modern medicine is extending the sinful lives of a portion of people, allowing them to eat away at this society more and harm more good and innocent people.</p>
<p>When can we truly make benevolent art save the world?</p>
<p>Occupation</p>
<h3>Where is the Way Out for Women?</h3>
<p>— Min Xing</p>
<p>I am one of the more than one hundred female employees in a transportation agency. We all underwent rigorous examinations before being employed, and were assigned to various groups just like the male colleagues. There are no mere ornaments here, and very few who try to curry favor. Our work efficiency is no different from that of our male colleagues. This is an undeniable fact. We all rely on our own efforts to survive and even bear the burden of supporting our families.</p>
<p>The outbreak of the war has caused the decline of all industries in Shanghai. Overseas postal routes have been cut off, and transportation to various places has been obstructed. Our agency's operating income has sharply decreased, and even the salaries of employees cannot be paid. In this situation, it seems that layoffs and salary reductions are inevitable. The first to be affected are the female employees, the reason being that women do not need to bear the burden of supporting a family, and that women go out to work only to share the burden of their fathers and brothers. But my father has passed away, I have no siblings, and my youngest brother is only five years old. If I am laid off, who will bear the burden of my family's life? The rice subsidy for married female employees has also been reduced from one dan to half a dan, the reason being that women do not need to bear the burden of supporting a family, and do not need to receive one dan of rice to support their husbands and children. The rice subsidy for married male colleagues is still one dan. But my husband was an employee of a British bank before the war, and is now unemployed after the war. Can I ask for a divorce because he is unemployed? Can law and human sentiment allow me to do so? It is the duty of a couple to help each other. Can I sit idly by and watch them starve to death? However, feudal ideas are firmly imprinted in the minds of the superiors. They do not observe the current situation of society, and they are not afraid to be the culprits of destroying the careers of female workers. Although we are standing on the side of justice and striving for our rights, we do not want to affect the careers of other women because of this.</p>
<p>We are all human beings doing the same work with equal qualifications, but women should be laid off first, and the remuneration women receive should be less than that of men. Even in a transportation agency with many years of history of employing female employees, this is still the case. Women are unfortunate to be born as women. Where, I ask, is the way out for women?</p>
<p>Local Customs</p>
<h3>Worm Tea</h3>
<p>— Luo Gan</p>
<p>When the local people offer worm tea to outsiders, they often add a word of recommendation. I once ate a bowl of it, and in terms of color, aroma, and taste, it was not bad. What was floating in the bowl were millet-like dark green things, which gradually evolved in the boiling water, which was very unique.</p>
<p>I asked the host what worm tea was. He said that it was something excreted by a small hard-shelled worm on the tea tree, because this worm only eats tender tea leaves, and it has passed through its digestive organs, so it is even more precious.</p>
<p>I was shocked when I heard this. Isn't this worm excrement? Who can have the appetite to digest something excreted by others? But the host said that in this day and age, there are many people who like to eat excrement.</p>

<h3>Glass Train</h3>
<p>— Xie Bin</p>
<p>Historians divide the progress of human civilization into several eras, such as the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age. But the stage we are in now is the Glass Age. The application of glass has become increasingly widespread, and even suspenders and belts are made of glass. Here we introduce a glass object, which is the glass train. It is precisely used to show off the wide range of uses of glass. Wherever glass can be used, glass is used to manufacture it. The decorations and utensils in the carriage are all made of glass. This kind of train can be said to be a crystal palace on wheels.</p>
<p>Chatterbox</p>
<h3>Face Powder and Dampness</h3>
<p>— Liang Can</p>
<p>(Four) Eat One Line, Complain About One Line</p>
<p>From the perspective of ordinary people, being a theater actor is really the most comfortable job. As long as you memorize the script, wear beautiful clothes, and walk a few steps casually in front of a beautiful set, shed a few tears when crying, and laugh a few times when laughing, not only can you get a big salary, but also your name will spread far and wide, and everyone will talk about you. The limelight is not weaker than that of movie stars. Thinking about it, it can't help but make people envy. In fact, this is a superficial view. The situation inside is not that simple at all.</p>
<p>In the past, being a basic actor in a professional theater troupe was not bad, because there were few theater troupes and many actors. In a troupe, there were enough actors for two or three plays, so there were performances and rests. You could even get paid every month without being assigned a role. But now it's different. There are many theater troupes established, but in the end there are only these people. When the actors are distributed to a troupe, there are few actors. When the actor list is arranged, almost all ordinary people are assigned to plays continuously. As soon as Play A is staged, Play B is already in rehearsals. In addition to performing two plays day and night, there are also rehearsals in the morning. Working from nine or ten o'clock in the morning until eleven o'clock at night, working almost ten hours a day, humans are not machines, how can they not be tired? And with a tired body, encountering plays that have been performed many times and are boring and lengthy, how can the performance be brilliant?</p>
<p>The fatigue of the body is nothing to say, the psychological fatigue is even more unbearable. It's okay to perform light comedies normally, but when encountering those depressing tragedies, crying and making a lot of noise five or six times in each scene, how can those who are not physically strong and psychologically sound be able to bear it? Besides, when acting, the emotions are always very tense. In addition, when the climax of the play arrives, the characters either fail or die. Ordinary people only encounter this greatest pain in life once or twice, but actors have to put themselves in their place and encounter it twice every day. Under such tension, the actors slowly become haggard. It is especially bitter to perform in cold weather in hot weather, or in ancient costumes, or in hot weather in cold weather. Actors often have to get injections backstage after performing on stage because they are not physically strong. As the saying goes, "It's hard to do a play with a stone mortar on your head, and it doesn't pay off." Acting like this is almost like carrying a stone mortar.</p>
<p>In addition, because the time for rehearsals and performances is uncertain, it often affects eating, so many people suffer from stomach problems. In addition, the face is covered with oil paint every day when acting, so most of the actors' skin is rough and yellow and cannot be seen up close. This kind of disadvantage caused by internal makeup especially affects female actors, because their youth fades faster on the stage. Therefore, they have to hone their acting skills as a long-term plan. But how can they have spare time when they are busy every day? As a result, they waste their years and watch their reputation decline day by day. This has to be said to be the sadness of theater actors.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(Ten) The Flying Peak</p>
<p>Cheng heard Qin Runzhi's unheard of words, and was both surprised and angry, saying that even though Yunqing's son had died, the local government had to pay for his burial. This bad example cannot be set. Mr. Qin, please don't say any more. Qin Runzhi smiled and said, "Young Master Ye, don't think of Wei Yunqing, and don't regard Wei Yunqing as a rich man. Just think that you heard that a beggar in the countryside died by the roadside. With the reputation of the Ye family of Shide Hall, you always have to take some money to bury him. That's all there is to it. Moreover, the money doesn't have to be much. Each family can contribute tens of dollars, and with ten or twenty families, it can be done." Ye's second wife interjected from the side, saying that ten dollars is still affordable. You can also raise donations by going to other people. Cheng said, "Who harmed Wei Shaoyun?" Qin Runzhi said, "I didn't figure this out either. Young Master Ye, I haven't been in the countryside for many days. I heard that there is also a woman involved in this."</p>
<p>Ye's second wife and Wei Cheng both had a heart of respecting gods and keeping them at a distance, and felt that sending Qin Runzhi away as soon as possible could clear their minds. So Ye's second wife threw out ten dollars. Qin Runzhi also wanted to ask for more. Cheng added ten dollars to him, saying that there would be no precedent for this. Runzhi smiled and said that Wei Yunqing only had one son, so naturally there would be no precedent for this. While collecting the money, he put on a smiling face and backed out. Cheng went back to the back and told Huang Long. Huang Long said, "Who is Qin Runzhi? I don't recognize him. How dare he use the name of that dead ghost to cheat money from house to house? Let me print this name in my mind." Cheng smiled and said, "It is possible that Wei Yunqing is a rascal who instigated Qin Runzhi to come out to raise money. It is also possible that Bang Runzhi is a con man who used Wei Yunqing's name to raise money. Anyway, we lost twenty dollars to get rid of a harmful worm for the local area, which is also worth it." Huang Long stretched out and hummed a breath, smiling and saying, "It's better for me to go out, but I can't go out. This is no different from being in jail." Wei Cheng smiled and said, "Wait until the rumors outside subside, and then you can walk out in a grand manner, right? The news I hear now doesn't mention Sister Cui Zhen's name, which is good. Maybe in another two or three days, everything will be fine." (209)</p>
