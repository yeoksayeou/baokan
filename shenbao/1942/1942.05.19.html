<p>瞿公乃忠吿之曰，一人若不領洗入敎，死將罰入地獄，不因帝王而例外」。此數句質直之言，屬天籌一一轉吿皇太后。皇太后雖已心傾向領洗，而未有勇氣。天壽又懇懇進言，以鼓其發勉之心；　公則為之講解敎理，準備洗禮；永曆帝亦表示贊成，於是乃定期舉行聖洗典禮矣。</p>
<p>本報特稿　七省反正　太子降生當此之時（永曆二年，）明室昌盛，兩湖，江西，雲，貴七省之地　入永曆版圖，奄有中國之半；而永曆太子適生，百祥畢集，萬姓騰歡。皇太后皇后等由是信心大增，深感天主大恩，向翟司鐸切求領洗。翟公鑒其誠意，在王宮小堂內，行付洗禮，奉敎官員咸與禮焉。永曆嫡母王太后，聖名赫肋納，生母馬太后，聖名瑪利亞，王皇后，聖名亞納；新生太子名慈烜，永曆初不准領洗，未幾太子病危；永曆乃准，聖名公斯當定。　公命名之意，蓋望太子將來如羅馬公斯當定大皇，率臣民奉敎，以再造此中國也。太子領洗後，病即痊愈。</p>
<p>聖洗禮之舉行，依伯希和先生所持之證據，即依據瞿公當時函牘之日期證之，當在一六四八年三四月間。即永曆二年；至領洗之地點，在廣西南寗，不在　憂，蓋永曆回牽廣，在李棟臣反正之後；小腆紀年卷十五·頁二十五云：「永曆二年八月還居焉」。皇后王亞納之領洗，在生太子之前，而太子之生，依小腆紀年及明季南略，行在陽秋均謂：四月丙寅朔，即公曆四月二十二日；惟行朝錄載謂四月乙未朔，即公曆五月一日，相差有一月；小腆紀年考曰：四月乙未朔日事，宗義得之傳聞，又以　月而誤也。而太子生之之前，桂王等正在南寗。（自公曆四月二日至七月三十日）又西史謂；皇太后領洗後數日，　公會向皇太后預祝，皇家必得天主降幅。果然八日後，而預祝應騐，即七省反正，歸入桂王權下：而七省之恢復，正在四月初十日乙亥，（五月二日）李臣棟以廣東反正也，故以時日計之，此時皇宮在南寗，而太子亦以四月初一日生，兩喜在皇太后領洗後，正合翟公預祝之幸福也。</p>
<p>遣使澳門　行彌撒禮皇太子病旣痊，明之叛將降淸者，又陸續反正；永曆承皇太后意，遣使澳門，請求舉行大禮　撒，一爲感謝天主所賜之恩寵，一為求天主眷佑明室。使臣係二位奉敎大臣，永曆一年十月十七日（一六四八）抵澳門。澳門葡人升砲致敬，耶穌會士均排隊出迎；使臣至耶穌會天主堂，虔恭叩拜天主，又將帶來禮物：計大蟠龍銀香爐一對，爲恭敬天主焚香之用，鏤花銀瓶兩對，內貯珍貴香料；又鏤花銀臘爐兩對，以永曆皇帝與皇太后，皇后之名，獻於耶穌會聖堂。除此種禮物外，又有三銀瓶，獻於耶穌會監會長，中國省會長，及澳門會院院長。</p>
<p>十月二十一日舉行大禮彌撒，主祭者係監會司鐸；彌撒中至奉獻經，使臣至祭台前，恭獻禮品，禮節隆重，觀者感動。彌撒畢，耶穌會十設盤筵，款侍使臣。使臣臨行，會士及澳門敎友餽贈許多聖物及歐西珍奇物品。葡國總督贈火槍百枝，以佐戎行。</p>
<p>上言永曆皇太后皈依天主敎事，其史料皆取自當時敎士之所記，而中國史籍無一語道及之者。至瞿式　，焦璉，龐天壽之忠心明室，至死發已，其德表足以炳耀千秋，而爲後人所矜式者也。（完）</p>
<p>大三巴牌坊澳門大三巴牌坊巍峨高聳於三巴街，高約十餘丈，壁上刻有四位聖像，　本為三巴寺之門樓。此敎堂於公元一五〇五年至一六〇二年間，時此敎堂為中國與日本天主敎之樞紐。至一八二五年全堂不幸被毀於火，僅餘四圖墻壁；至一八三八年，遂將三面墻壁拆去，而留門樓，以供遊客臨</p>

<p>兒童是國家未來的主人翁，所以兒童保育工作的重要性，誰也不能忽視,上海基督敎女靑年會，爲增加婦女的生產能力，及促進托兒所運動起見，設有托兒所二所，一個是上海托兒所，一個是職業婦女托兒所，設備都很完善，辦理也極認眞，對不少天眞活潑而家境貧寒的小朋友，和爲生計所迫，不得不在職業界服務的婦女們，有着極大的貢獻，記者爲求明瞭該兩托兒所的內容起見，特分別前往參觀，現在把觀感所及，略述於後。</p>
<p>上海托兒所</p>
<p>上海托兒所地點在大西路六十六號，離地　路小很遠，該處房屋，原來是一所三層樓的私人住宅，故庭院廣闊，屋宇寬敞，樹木茂盛，空氣淸新，環境是相當的幽靜，據說該托兒所原設白利南路B卅七號同仁醫院的房屋內，那時並不支付租金，每月僅負担水電費一百五十元，到去年十二月八日以後，纔遷至大西路現址，目前每月須付房租法幣七百元，六月份後，租金將更增加至儲鈔一千二百元，能否負担頗成問題，該所成立於去年三月，當時全年支出預算僅法幣四萬元，嗣後各項物價騰貴不已，維持現狀，甚感困難，而女靑年會當局亦未便時常向各界捐款，該所設立時的用意，原係爲貧苦兒童服務，故完全不收費用，後來因有中上家庭的子女，也要求寄養，乃酌量招收附學生，每月暫定納費一百二十元，這樣，對經費方面，可稍獲挹注，而托兒所運動，亦較易普遍。現在該所寄養的兒童，連附學生在內約有五十人，大多數是男孩，他們完全住宿在內，年齡自一歲至四足歲，免費兒童的家長，大多屬於勞工階級，尤其是在鐵工廠·綢緞廠·襪廠·等做工的最多，這些小朋友們，因家長智識較差，且父母山外工作時，子女在家，無人照顧，往往使他們整日幽居一室，不與外界接觸，因此他們的智能發展，受着極大的影響，每有年齡二逾二歲，而仍不能說話，經醫師檢查其發音器官，却又並無損傷，可見遺傳與環境，與兒童的智慧，頗有關係。他們寄住所內以後，有敎師敎以說話，辨認顏色，及灌輸相當的幼稚敎育，進步頗見迅速。至於他們所穿的衣服，均山所供給，僅鞋子由其家長送去。膳食方面，每天四次，第一次在早晨七點鐘，吃粥·餅乾或自製的饅頭，第二次十一時半，年齡稍長的吃飯，幼小的吃粥，菜餚中華的有鷄蛋猪肝等，素的有蔬菜洋山芋南瓜等，每日輸流，使能變換口味，且用適當方法烹煮，傳易於消化。十二時半午睡，至二時餘起身，三時半進點心，多數用自製的豆腐漿，及向餅乾廠購得的碎餅乾，六時至七時晚餐，用粥·飯·或肉骨湯麵。在目前的上海，膳食已成爲嚴重問題，該所幸向工部局申請購得白米，並在可能範圍內，一方顧及兒童的營養，一方力求適合經濟的原則，照現在預算，每一兒童，每天菜餚所費，約爲法幣五角，倘有熱心於兒童保育　業的人士，願意担任助養兒童一人，每月祗須納費三十元，上海不乏殷富之家，區區此數，可稱輕而易舉，該所的房屋，在最近的將來，有發生問題的可能，如有租金特廉的屋宇，能租給他們使用，那是上海托兒所方面所十分盼望的。</p>
<p>職業婦女托兒所</p>
<p>職業婦女托兒所也是由女靑年會所主辦，地點在威海衛路六百三十八號，該所成立於去年三月，因感職業婦女出外辦公，把子女切在家中，大多不很放心，故初辦之時，僅有日間托兒，從早晨至下午五時半為止，那時尙　試騐性質，而所收的小朋友，也祗有五人，後來陸續增加，可見社會上確實有此需要，乃擴充名額，並可留住所內，托兒所內的兒童，木規定至四足歲爲止，今年二月，更設幼稚園，以便繼續在所內受適當的幼稚敎育，現在該托兒所內的小朋友共有五十二人，其中男孩有一十八人，女孩二十四人，全體兒童中，有二十四人住宿所內，其餘均於傍晚時由家長領回，這些小朋友們的家庭狀况，或因父母不全，乏人撫育，或因家境關係，不能雇用相當的傭人，有的父母，因子女衆多，難於照料，也有因母親在生產期間，不得不把孩子們暫時寄養，祗須兒童的年齡在四足歲以內，經醫生檢騐證明體格健全，具有保證，而繳納規定的費用，倘有餘額，就可入所寄養，現在日間托兒，每月六十四元，减費者納三十一元，住所的兒童，每月納費一百二十元，减費者納八十八元，這個費用，包括膳食，洗衣，毛巾，肥皂，藥品，玩具，敎育用品，一切在內，依目前物價計算，僅足供食米，保育費及一部份伙食，職員薪水，須賴捐款抵補。</p>
<p>就記者觀察所得，基督敎女靑年會創辦這兩個托兒所，不論在物質上或精神上，都可說是苦心經營，辦事人員的毅力，是値得重視的，當今孤島環境中，多數人祇知道「巧取豪奪，」不知服務社會爲何物，這種有關民族前途的保育事業，亟應扶助其發展，這樣不但能增進家庭的幸福，對社會也有莫大的利益。（楨）</p>

<p>— 葛亮</p>
<p>在個冷僻的地方，兩只老鼠遇到了，一陣寒喧之後，便閒話少說，言歸正傳了。「你的房東有沒有米？」「無！」「我家也沒有，前晚我找尋了六個時辰才找到粒采。」「此夕謂粒粒皆辛苦也。」「所以我專門咬房東的器具和衣服，弄得他們每件衣服都是洞。」「枊子厚之　室無完器，　無完衣，飲食大率鼠之餘，」此之謂也。」「怎麼三日不見，你的話我一句也不懂了。你在房東家拿什麽東西做食物的？」「書。因爲房東家徒四壁，除了書之外，便一無所有了，所以我一日三餐都是書。」「怪不得你弄得一付寒酸氣了，不過我聽見人們說百無一用是書……書什麼？我勸你，書還是少吃比較好。」「東風坎皺一池春水，干卿何事？」「那末書有什味道？」「書中自有味如肉。——說起肉，我吿訴你：我的房東一天到晚不是叫着三月不知肉味，便楚吟着歸去乎食無肉，現在突然想吃鼠肉了，眞是想入非非。」「人吃鼠肉？我是從來沒有聽見過。」「眞是少見多怪！考據史實，掘鼠羅雀，漢有蘇武，唐有張巡。昨晚，他操刀以伺，一見我便向我走來，於是我取三十六策之上策，抱頭鼠竄，逃之夭夭，，溜之大吉。」「唔！」</p>

<p>踏進照相館，擠着滿屋的人，這眞使我生氣，爲了畢業證明書而去拍的二寸半身照，據說要四大後可取，好吧，就是四天。可是現在已是第六天了。</p>
<p>照例擠了進去，將取照證給了一個店員。</p>
<p>「再過二三天。」天哪，父是二三天！「怎麼，拍二寸的照片難道要九大嗎？從前道種報名照半打至多五六角錢，而且隔日可取。現在費了四元祗拍四張，爲什麽還要再過二三天呢？」我憤憤地說。</p>
<p>「可不是嗎？從前十幾元錢即可買米一担，而且能送到府上，如今一升半米賣五元，還耍半夜裏去待着軋，買得到買不到還是一個問題。過二三天，就是過二三天，譬如軋米，二三天後請冉來跑一趟罷。」</p>

<p>— 蹣跚</p>
<p>說起傀儡，在中國倒是很早就發明的，記得漢高祖劉邦被困在白登城的時候，他的謀士陳平知道冒頓的太太奇妬，就利用木雕的美女把那位懼內的將軍逼走了。至于傀儡戲，則在我童年的時候還可以看到。那是許多不到一尺長的木偶，外面吊着各種不同的臉譜，由一個演戲的人把兩隻指頭伸在衣服裏表演着的。一個出塲以後，交待明白，就揷在不滿三尺見方的舞台邊上，于是第二個父用回一方法山塲了。角色的說白，都由幕後人一手包辦，看樣子是很費力的。那時化了一塊幾毛錢就可以雇他半天。吃這一行飯的人都是走江湖朋友，到現在說起來，也應該算是導演了。</p>
<p>以上這些是我看到「上海傀儡戲劇團」成立的新聞才想起的。時代不同了，傀儡的製造方面也有了顯著的進步，據報載：「不但能依音樂節拍而跳舞，且雙眼能隨環境需要而開閉，言語時雙脣亦能移動如生。」聞導演人爲哥脫林，是德國的有名電影導演，並有猶太專家多人爲之牽綫，其演出的效果，我雖沒有目覩，出比起走江湖朋友來一定要高明得多，—也就是說逼眞得多了。</p>
<p>其實十多年以前，六馬路一帶，不是儘多着　聲舞台之類的玩意兒嗎？它們不但能演「遊龍戲鳳」等的玩笑戲，眞刀眞槍的三本「鐵公鷄」也能應付裕如。現在舊調重彈，又覺得新奇不置了。這正如汽車淘汰之後，脚踏車也出足風頭一樣，眞是所謂彼一時此一時也。</p>

<p>到了那間屋子裏，維城把他們兄妹的大衣掛在衣架上。喜鵲奔進來喚道：「陳小姐，你到今天才來，翠珍小姐和我們，都惦記着陳小姐呢。」國芳對喜鵲一笑道：「喜鵲，謝謝你，你這幾天很忙了吧？」維城道：「你們兄妹坐下，國芳也別對喜鵲敷衍了。你們是從上海來，還是從雙橋來？」國芳突然向鬥口招招手道：「翠珍姊來！」國器和維城回頭來看，見翠珍　膊上擐着一件白布旗袍，頭是探進來了，脚還是在外面，給國芳一喚，訕訕的走到裏邊，說：「陳小姐，你請座，這一位是陳先生？」國芳忙奔上去，和她拉手道：，「道是家兄。哥哥，道是翠珍姊，是葉先生府上唯一的內務總管。」</p>
<p>國器國芳維城翠珍都隨意坐下來。這一間屋子原是維城計劃把來做女賓會客室的，所以裏邊的一間便是女賓寢室。國器笑道：「我妹妹只來了一次，比我熟的多。前回我妹妹到這裏來了，我是病着：後來她回雙橋，說維城遭了大故，我們兄妹眞是扼腕歎惜，大家咒詛着天道無知。我當時要妹妹陪着我來安慰你幾句，可是家祖母不肯，一則我病體沒復原，再則說我月建不利，這個月不該到喪家。」維城道：「後來是開學了，你們都得回上海去。」國器道：「是的，到上海，上課也上了一星期了。」</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Battle for Kharkov: Germany Sends Reinforcements for a Counterattack; Soviets Claim to Have Secured Several Strongholds <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Soviet Border, May 17 (Havas) – Observers analyze the situation in the Kharkov region as follows: The strength of the German resistance has exceeded the expectations of the Red Army. The achievements of the Red Army are limited to occupying about ten minor villages and towns. The strongholds of Belgorod and Kharkov are apparently still in German hands. The Soviets are using a large number of tanks in the battle, with hundreds of vehicles lost. The German army has launched an unprecedented fierce counterattack, while the Red Army is persistent, determined to win. The two sides are in a stalemate. In short, the importance of the battle in this area can be compared to the Battle of Verdun in 1916.</p>
<p>Berlin, May 18 (Domei) – The German High Command announced yesterday that after establishing a bridgehead on the central sector of the Eastern Front, German troops continued to advance and occupy a village under strong Soviet defense. German counterattacks south of Lake Ilmen were successful, and German advances on the north bank made progress. German artillery continued to fiercely bombard enemy military installations and armaments factories in Leningrad. An explosion and fire were observed at the Kirov factory.</p>
<p>Führer Headquarters, May 18 (Domei) – This afternoon’s German war report stated that the remaining enemy forces on the Kerch Peninsula, despite their desperate resistance, have no chance of survival. In the Kharkov region, our army’s counterattack included a fierce tank battle, in which 56 enemy tanks were destroyed, and another 50 were bombed by German aircraft, rendering them immobile. Around Lake Ilmen, German aircraft bombed enemy camps and supply columns. Our forces in the Lapland area have made advances. Hungarian forces routed the enemy in the enemy’s rear. German aircraft sank five large transport ships in the Murmansk area.</p>
<p>London, May 18 (Reuters) – London officials stated this afternoon that Marshal Timoshenko’s Soviet forces are currently attacking along a hundred-mile front in the Kharkov region. The Soviet attack line appears to arc from Volchansk (40 miles northeast of Kharkov), through Chuguev (15 miles southeast of Kharkov), to Krasnograd (50 miles southwest of Kharkov). The German side has deployed reserve forces for a counterattack. From the 15th to the 16th, our army advanced 20 to 30 kilometers, recovering 300 inhabited places. A Soviet Information Bureau communique stated that on the night of May 17, our forces launched an offensive on the Kharkov front. Heavy fighting continued throughout the night near the city of Kerch. No major events occurred in other areas of the front. A Soviet supplementary communique stated that our forces in the Kharkov area continued to advance despite German resistance. German attacks in the northwest Kalinin area were repulsed. There is guerrilla warfare in the rear of the German army on the Smolensk front. Moscow Radio broadcast that Marshal Timoshenko’s troops had captured several locations on the Kharkov front and contained the German counterattack. Many German tanks were destroyed.</p>

<p>Tokyo, May 18 (Domei) – Observers here stated today that Japanese forces in Burma are advancing north along the Chindwin River and have cut off the retreat of 20,000 British troops in the Kale Valley area. This location is only 60 kilometers from the Indian border. If deemed necessary, the Japanese army is prepared to invade India at any time.</p>
<p>Rangoon, May 17 (Domei) – Japanese army aircraft flew over the Arakan Mountains at 11:00 AM on the 16th and bombed Imphal in the Indian state of Assam. They heavily bombed enemy troops and units gathering there from the Burmese side, destroying many trucks loaded with military supplies and inflicting heavy damage. They also destroyed the remaining military facilities. The Japanese aircraft safely returned to their bases after completing their missions.</p>

<p>London, May 16 (Reuters) – According to front-line reports received from Moscow last night, Soviet troops have managed to land behind German forces on the Kerch Peninsula, and fierce fighting is still ongoing in that area.</p>
<p>Berlin, May 18 (Domei) – The German High Command issued the following war report, supplementing details of the annihilation of the remaining Soviet forces on the Kerch Peninsula, stating that German and Romanian forces are pressing on the remaining Soviet troops at the tip of the Kerch Peninsula. Although the Soviet troops are in a pincer encirclement, they are putting up a strong resistance. In the past two days, the Soviet troops have repeatedly attempted to break out of the encirclement, but have been defeated by German forces. In the Kerch battles, the Soviet army has continuously sacrificed manpower in large numbers, as the Soviet political commissars have ordered that no sacrifice be spared in the hope of breaking through the encirclement. A unit of Soviet troops landing on the Kerch Peninsula attempted to rescue the surrounded Soviet troops, but they themselves were also encircled. Therefore, the number of Soviet prisoners of war is increasing daily. A German engineer battalion near Bapaz unearthed as many as 15,000 Soviet-laid landmines in one day. The large number of landmines buried by the Soviet army demonstrates the strength of the Soviet defenses.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Overview of the International Situation in the Past Week <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Vichy, May 17 (Havas) – Among the fluctuations in the international situation, the past week has been the most intense. The most noteworthy event is Germany’s resumption of large-scale offensives on the Eastern Front. German forces began attacking Kerch, after months of relative quiet. The intensity has been exceptionally fierce. The next issue is the question of French territories in the Western Hemisphere. France received a U.S. note on the 15th of this month seeking to change the legal status of the French West Indies. This issue has not yet been resolved, and all parties are deeply anxious about the future of U.S.-French relations. The British occupation of Diego Suarez in Madagascar, with moral support from the United States, has aroused resentment in French public opinion. France is determined to defend its full sovereignty over its colonies and to adhere to the Franco-German armistice agreement without wavering. Negotiations are currently continuing on the basis of these conditions. Furthermore, Prime Minister Churchill’s speech on May 10, which touched on the issue of gas warfare, has provoked a serious reaction. In Eastern Europe, relations between Romania and Hungary have become strained. Romanian Prime Minister General Antonescu delivered a speech on May 14, openly demanding the return of Outer Transylvania. Turkey, on the other hand, remains neutral among the belligerent nations. German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, issued a written statement declaring that German military plans do not include Turkey. This is very important. Moreover, Pope Pius XII delivered a radio address on the 14th, calling for peace. In the Atlantic, a Mexican oil tanker was sunk by a submarine in the Gulf of Mexico, which may lead to that country’s involvement in the war.</p>

<p>Bristol, England, May 17 (Havas) – Lord Privy Seal Sir Stafford Cripps delivered a speech here today, stating that there is no reason for optimism at present. He said, “Recently, I have seen the country filled with optimism. We have reasons for hope and confidence in the future, but we must not be overly optimistic. There is currently no reason for complacency. We must realize that only by making the greatest efforts can we achieve victory. Regarding my previous trip to India, I absolutely believe that once the current war is over, Britain is sincere in granting independence to India. Unfortunately, the Indian leaders did not see this and refused to accept it. However, this proposal will still be the basis for organizing the Indian government after the war. Furthermore, the general public has recently hoped to take the offensive. The government’s desire to explore this action is not behind anyone, but the difficulty lies in those who bear the responsibility of command, who cannot speak lightly at this time.”</p>

<p>Paris, May 18 (Domei) – It was learned here last night that French Prime Minister Laval has arrived in Paris to attend an important meeting.</p>
<p>Vichy, May 17 (Havas) – While speaking yesterday, French Prime Minister Laval stated that French warships and merchant ships will never fall into the hands of any country. People here generally believe that the government has instructed all French ships in the West Indies to scuttle themselves if there is any risk of being captured. The current state of U.S.-French relations is also the focus of discussion among political figures here. However, newspapers and radio stations remain silent, only publishing the American note and the French response. In the occupied territories, all newspapers are carrying this news on the front page in large type and commenting on it extensively, but their views do not represent the government’s position.</p>

<p>Rome, May 17 (Havas) – The "Messaggero" recently reported that in recent months, the British island of Malta has been subjected to fierce bombings by Axis aircraft. Although the island’s airfield is still in use, daily reports state that several aircraft are being destroyed on the ground. Britain has always regarded Malta as a major unsinkable aircraft carrier for attacking Italy and has long been preparing the airfield thoroughly. Even recently, Britain dispatched air forces from Gibraltar and Alexandria to reinforce it, but they were intercepted by German and Italian air forces, preventing them from reaching their destination. Even if aircraft manage to reach the island, they are still destroyed by Axis aircraft upon arrival. However, the strategic importance of Malta remains significant, and it is still a major stronghold in the current war.</p>
<p>Berlin, May 18 (Havas) – A radio station here recently broadcast that from May 8th to 15th, the British Air Force lost 79 aircraft over the Mediterranean. German aircraft sank three British destroyers along the coast of the British island of Malta, and a cruiser was damaged by German aircraft in Valletta harbor. In addition, according to news from Italy, since the outbreak of the current war, 64 enemy submarines have been sunk in the Mediterranean.</p>

Yesterday, our reconnaissance aircraft discovered it sailing south along the Norwegian coast, apparently intending to return to its home country for repairs. Upon receiving the report, our Coastal Command dispatched a squadron of aircraft, which sighted the ship near the southern tip of Norway at night and immediately attacked it. According to initial reports, the ship was hit by an aerial torpedo. At the time, the "Prinz Eugen" was being protected by four torpedo boats and several destroyers. Fierce fighting ensued, and several torpedo boats sustained multiple hits on their bridges. Five enemy Messerschmitt aircraft and several other types of aircraft were damaged. Nine of our aircraft are missing.</p>

<p>Vichy, May 17 (Havas) – The 25th anniversary of Pope Pius XII’s episcopate was marked on the 14th of this month. The Pope delivered a radio address to the world, calling on both sides of the warring nations to respect humanity, which has attracted the world's attention. In recent months, the Vatican newspaper "L'Osservatore Romano" has repeatedly published articles reviewing the Vatican’s responsibilities in the current situation, expressing that the Vatican does not wish to take sides with any of the warring nations, but will mediate as soon as the situation matures. The Vatican's neutral position is not only recognized by Roman Catholics, but also by other Christians. In addition, Vatican newspapers have also recalled the Pope's various diplomatic achievements when he served as Vatican Secretary of State, such as the treaty concluded with Bavaria in 1925, the treaty concluded with Prussia in 1929, and numerous visits to France and the United States. When he assumed the papacy, he expressed his willingness to be a pope of peace, but since the outbreak of the current war, he has stopped direct activities and only repeatedly called for peace to the world and established diplomatic relations with some countries.</p>

<p>Macau, May 18 (Domei) – According to news here, an important newspaper reported yesterday that the government ordered the closure of all teahouses, coffee shops, and ice cream parlors on Friday. The reasons for the government’s adoption of this measure are as follows: These types of shops can cause people to become lazy and demoralized. These types of shops are being used as locations for the black market. The government is evacuating unnecessary residents. The patrons of these types of shops have not practiced wartime frugality. The owners of these types of shops have been ordered to join the army or report to the military training office or engage in wartime industry. All such shops with capital of 20,000 to 300,000 yuan are subject to closure, so it is estimated that the total capital of the closed shops is 3 million yuan.</p>

<p>瞿公乃忠吿之曰，一人若不領洗入敎，死將罰入地獄，不因帝王而例外」。此數句質直之言，屬天籌一一轉吿皇太后。皇太后雖已心傾向領洗，而未有勇氣。天壽又懇懇進言，以鼓其發勉之心； 公則為之講解敎理，準備洗禮；永曆帝亦表示贊成，於是乃定期舉行聖洗典禮矣。</p>
<p>瞿 Gong, being loyal, advised, "If a person does not receive baptism into the Church, they will be punished and sent to hell after death, and there will be no exceptions even for emperors." These straightforward words were reported to the Empress Dowager in full by Tian Chou. Although the Empress Dowager was already inclined to be baptized, she did not have the courage. Tian Shou earnestly gave further advice to encourage her; Gong then explained the doctrines of the Church and prepared for the baptism; Emperor Yongli also expressed his approval, and so it was decided to hold the baptism ceremony on a set date.</p>
<h3 id="e25">本報特稿 七省反正 太子降生當此之時 <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>(Yongli, Year Two,) the Ming Dynasty was flourishing. The lands of seven provinces, including Huguang, Jiangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou, entered the territory of Yongli, holding half of China. And just as the Yongli heir was born, all blessings gathered, and the people rejoiced. Because of this, the Empress Dowager, the Empress, and others greatly increased their faith and deeply felt the great grace of God, earnestly requesting baptism from Father Zhai. Father Zhai, discerning their sincerity, performed the baptism ceremony in a small chapel within the palace, with the Christian officials all participating in the ceremony. The Emperor Yongli's stepmother, Empress Dowager Wang, took the Christian name Helena; his biological mother, Empress Dowager Ma, took the Christian name Maria; and Empress Wang took the Christian name Anna. The newborn heir was named Ci Xuan. Emperor Yongli initially did not permit him to be baptized, but shortly afterward, the heir fell critically ill. Yongli then granted permission, and he was given the Christian name Constantine. The priest named him with the hope that the heir would, in the future, be like the great Roman Emperor Constantine, leading his subjects to embrace Christianity, thereby recreating China. The heir's illness was cured immediately after his baptism.</p>
<p>According to the evidence held by Mr. Bo Xihe, based on the date of Father Qu's letters at the time, the baptism ceremony took place between March and April 1648, which was Yongli's second year. As for the location of the baptism, it was in Nanning, Guangxi, not Zhaoqing, as Yongli returned to Qian Guang after Li Dongchen's rebellion. The Xiao Tian Ji Nian, volume fifteen, page twenty-five, states: "In the eighth month of the second year of Yongli, he returned to reside there." Empress Wang Anna's baptism took place before the birth of the heir, and according to the Xiaotian Ji Nian, the Ming Ji Nan Lue, and the Xingzai Yangqiu, the heir was born on the first day of the fourth month, Bingyin, which corresponds to April 22nd in the Gregorian calendar. However, the Xingchao Lu records that he was born on the first day of the fourth month, Yiwei, which corresponds to May 1st in the Gregorian calendar, a difference of one month. The Xiaotian Ji Nian examines this and states: "The events of the first day of the fourth month, Yiwei, were obtained through hearsay by Zong Yide and are a mistake of one month." Before the birth of the heir, Prince Gui and others were in Nanning (from April 2nd to July 30th in the Gregorian calendar). Furthermore, Western history states that several days after the Empress Dowager's baptism, Father Gong would congratulate the Empress Dowager in advance, saying that the Imperial family would certainly receive the blessings of God. Sure enough, eight days later, the prediction was fulfilled, as seven provinces rebelled and returned to the authority of Prince Gui. The restoration of the seven provinces occurred on the tenth day of the fourth month, Yi Hai, (May 2nd), with Li Chen Dong's rebellion in Guangdong. Therefore, calculating based on the dates, the Imperial Palace was in Nanning at this time, and the heir was born on the first day of the fourth month, two joys following the Empress Dowager's baptism, precisely matching the blessings predicted by Father Zhai.</p>
<p>Sending an envoy to Macau, performing the Mass Ceremony</p>
<p>Once the imperial heir recovered from his illness, the Ming Dynasty's rebel generals who had surrendered to the Qing Dynasty successively revolted. Emperor Yongli, following the Empress Dowager's intentions, sent an envoy to Macau, requesting the performance of a grand Mass, firstly to express gratitude for the graces bestowed by God, and secondly to seek God's blessings for the Ming Dynasty. The envoy consisted of two Christian ministers, who arrived in Macau on October 17th of the first year of Yongli (1648). The Portuguese in Macau fired cannons in salute, and the Jesuits all lined up to welcome them. The envoy arrived at the Jesuit Church, piously prostrating themselves before God, and also presented the gifts they had brought: a pair of large, dragon-carved silver incense burners, for the purpose of burning incense to revere God; two pairs of silver vases with carved flowers, containing precious incense; and two pairs of silver candle holders with carved flowers, in the names of Emperor Yongli, the Empress Dowager, and the Empress, dedicated to the Jesuit Church. In addition to these gifts, there were also three silver vases, dedicated to the Jesuit Superior, the Provincial Superior of China, and the Rector of the Macau Monastery.</p>
<p>On October 21st, a grand Mass was held, presided over by the Supervising Priest. During the Mass, at the Offertory, the envoy went to the altar and respectfully offered the gifts. The ceremony was solemn, and the observers were moved. After the Mass, the Jesuits set up ten tables for a feast, to entertain the envoy. Before the envoy departed, the Jesuits and the Macau Christians presented them with many holy objects and rare Western items. The Portuguese Governor gifted them one hundred muskets to assist their military campaign.</p>
<p>The above account of Empress Dowager Yongli's conversion to Catholicism, its historical materials all taken from the records of the missionaries at the time, with not a single word mentioned in Chinese historical records. As for Qu Shi-si, Jiao Lian, and Pang Tian-shou's loyalty to the Ming Dynasty, they exhausted their efforts until death, and their virtues are sufficient to illuminate the ages, and to be a model for later generations. (The End)</p>
<p>The Ruins of St. Paul's, Macau The Ruins of St. Paul's in Macau stand tall and majestic on Sanba Street, rising over ten zhang in height, with images of four saints carved on its walls. It was originally the gate tower of the Sanba Temple. This church, built between 1505 and 1602 AD, served as the hub of Catholicism for China and Japan. Unfortunately, the entire church was destroyed by fire in 1825, leaving only the four walls. In 1838, three of the walls were demolished, leaving only the gate tower for tourists to view.</p>

<h3 id="e30">Stolen Goods Already Reported Should Not Be Resold by Pawnshops <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The home of Russian Shirmainov, located in Room 12, No. 651 Weihaiwei Road, was broken into by a Russian thief, Feiergaofu, in September of last year. The thief stole a set of silver decorative items and utensils worth over ten thousand yuan, as well as a diamond ring, and fled. Later, the thief pawned the stolen goods at the Hong'an Pawnshop, No. 742 Xiafei Road in the French Concession, for over seven hundred yuan. The Public Concession Police have now arrested the Russian thief, who confessed to the crime. The French Concession Police were notified and summoned Zhao Shande, the clerk of the Hong'an Pawnshop, to the police station for questioning. Zhao confessed that the stolen goods were sold to him by a Western woman and not pawned. He had already sold the stolen goods to an unknown person for over eight hundred yuan, and the original stolen goods could not be recovered. The police chief stated that the stolen goods had been reported, and a loss notice had been sent to all pawnshops. Zhao Shande, the clerk of Hong'an Pawnshop, had received this notice and should not have dared to sell the stolen goods. His actions were deliberately in violation of the regulations. The police chief ordered him to be detained for further investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e42">A Visit to Two Daycare Centers Sponsored by the Young Women's Christian Association <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Children are the future masters of the nation, so the importance of childcare cannot be ignored. The Shanghai Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) has established two daycare centers to increase women's productivity and promote the daycare movement: the Shanghai Daycare Center and the Working Women's Daycare Center. Both facilities are well-equipped and well-managed, making a significant contribution to many innocent, lively children from impoverished families and women who are forced to work in order to make a living. To understand the content of these two daycare centers, the reporter made separate visits to observe them, and now I will briefly describe my impressions.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Shanghai Daycare Center <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Daycare Center is located at 66 Daxilu Road, not far from Dadulu Road. The building was originally a three-story private residence, so the courtyard is spacious, the buildings are large, the trees are lush, the air is fresh, and the environment is quite quiet. It is said that the daycare center was originally located in the building of Tongren Hospital at B37 Bailinan Road, where no rent was paid, and only 150 yuan was spent on water and electricity each month. After December 8th of last year, it was moved to its current location on Daxilu Road. Currently, the monthly rent is 700 yuan in legal tender, and the rent will increase to 1,200 yuan in savings certificates after June, making it difficult to bear the cost. The daycare center was established in March last year, and the annual budget at that time was only 40,000 yuan in legal tender. Since then, prices have continued to rise, making it very difficult to maintain the status quo. The YWCA authorities have also been reluctant to ask for donations from all walks of life. The original intention of the daycare center was to serve poor children, so it was completely free. Later, because children from middle and upper class families also requested foster care, a small number of fee-paying students were admitted, with a provisional monthly fee of 120 yuan. In this way, financial support could be slightly increased, and the daycare center movement would be easier to popularize. Currently, there are about 50 children, including fee-paying students, who are being fostered in the daycare center, most of whom are boys. They live in the daycare center full-time, and their ages range from one to four years old. The parents of the free children mostly belong to the working class, especially those who work in iron factories, silk factories, and sock factories. These children, because their parents have less knowledge and are unable to care for them while working outside the home, often spend their days confined to a room, not interacting with the outside world. As a result, their intellectual development is greatly affected. There are often children over the age of two who still cannot speak. However, when a doctor examines their vocal organs, there is no damage. This shows that heredity and environment are closely related to a child's intelligence. After they live in the daycare center, teachers teach them to speak, identify colors, and impart appropriate kindergarten education, and their progress is quite rapid. As for the clothes they wear, they are all provided by the daycare center, and only the shoes are sent by their parents. In terms of diet, there are four meals a day. The first meal is at 7:00 in the morning, with porridge, crackers, or homemade steamed buns. The second meal is at 11:30, with older children eating rice and younger children eating porridge. The dishes include eggs and pork liver, and vegetarian dishes include vegetables, potatoes, and pumpkin. They are rotated daily to vary the taste and cooked in appropriate ways to make them easy to digest. They take a nap from 12:30 to 2:00, and then have a snack at 3:30, mostly homemade soybean milk and broken crackers purchased from cracker factories. Dinner is from 6:00 to 7:00, with porridge, rice, or meat and bone soup noodles. In present-day Shanghai, diet has become a serious problem. Fortunately, the daycare center has applied to the Shanghai Municipal Council for the purchase of white rice and, to the extent possible, both considers the children's nutrition and strives to be economical. According to the current budget, each child spends about five jiao in legal tender each day on dishes. If there are people who are enthusiastic about childcare and are willing to sponsor a child, they only need to pay 30 yuan per month. Shanghai is not short of wealthy families, and this small amount can be said to be easy. The daycare center's building may have problems in the near future. If there are buildings with particularly low rents that can be rented to them, that is what the Shanghai Daycare Center is very much hoping for.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Working Women's Daycare Center <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>The Working Women's Daycare Center is also sponsored by the YWCA and is located at No. 638 Weihaiwei Road. The daycare center was established in March of last year. Because working women are often worried about leaving their children at home while they are out of the office, only daytime childcare was provided at the beginning, from morning until 5:30 in the afternoon. At that time, it was still of an experimental nature, and there were only five children admitted. Later, the number gradually increased, showing that there was indeed a need for it in society. The number of places was then expanded, and lodging was also provided. The daycare center's children are not allowed to be over four years old. In February of this year, a kindergarten was also established to provide appropriate kindergarten education for children who continue to be in the daycare center. Currently, there are a total of 52 children in the daycare center, including 18 boys and 24 girls. Among all the children, 24 live in the daycare center, and the rest are picked up by their parents in the evening. The family circumstances of these children are either because their parents are not complete and lack caregivers, or because of family financial circumstances and they cannot afford to hire adequate servants, or because their parents have many children and are difficult to care for, or because their mothers are in childbirth and have to temporarily foster their children. As long as the child is under the age of four, has been examined by a doctor and proven to be healthy, has a guarantee, and pays the prescribed fee, they can be admitted to the daycare center. The current monthly fee for daytime childcare is 64 yuan, and 31 yuan for those who receive a reduction. The monthly fee for children who live in the daycare center is 120 yuan, and 88 yuan for those who receive a reduction. This fee includes meals, laundry, towels, soap, medicine, educational supplies, and everything else. Based on current prices, this is only enough to cover rice, childcare costs, and a portion of the food, and staff salaries must be covered by donations.</p>
<p>According to the reporter's observations, the YWCA's establishment of these two daycare centers has been a painstaking effort, both materially and spiritually. The perseverance of the staff is worthy of respect. In the current isolated island environment, most people only know how to "cleverly seize and plunder," and do not know what it means to serve society. This kind of childcare that is related to the future of the nation should be supported for its development. This will not only improve family happiness but also benefit society greatly. (Zhen)</p>

<h3 id="e47">Yarn Soars Like a Falcon, Fluctuating Unpredictably <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Cotton yarn market conditions: spot prices have been soaring continuously, causing bulls to take profits and sell off, and the market initially rose and then softened. 42-count Blue Phoenix was priced at 16,050 yuan to 16,200 yuan, with a closing price of 16,000 yuan. 42-count Immortal Peach was priced at 15,150 yuan to 14,950 yuan. 41-count Yanghe was priced at 15,400 yuan. 60-count Five Sons was priced at 25,500 yuan. 80-count Color Ball was priced at 40,000 yuan. 40-count Golden Bridge was priced at 13,800 yuan. 20-count Blue Phoenix was priced at 9,200 yuan to 9,000 yuan. 20-count Moon Zero was priced at 8,400 yuan. 20-count Double Earth was priced at 8,200 yuan to 8,045 yuan. 20-count Double Horse was priced at 8,000 yuan to 8,150 yuan, closing at 8,000 yuan to 7,950 yuan. 20-count Blue Phoenix spot was priced at 8,500 yuan. 16-count Red Kui Star was priced at 7,930 yuan. 20-count Heavenly Girl was priced at 7,800 yuan to 8,030 yuan. 20-count Great Joy was priced at 8,200 yuan. 20-count Special Golden City was priced at 8,000 yuan. 10-count Red Double Horse was priced at 6,650 yuan to 6,550 yuan. 10-count Boy Scout was priced at 6,550 yuan to 6,150 yuan. 10-count Red Bao Yi was priced at 6,450 yuan to 6,250 yuan. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse factory single was 6,000 yuan, but it soon fell to 5,870 yuan. It was then heard that the spot goods were good, and gradually rose to a closing price of 6,210 yuan. However, after the close, it was heard that the yarn price had fallen back, and it then plummeted to 5,900 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the rise in the leading cloth, the price also rose. Currently, the yarn market is enthusiastic among speculators, jumping for a week in a row. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse has soared by 1,700 yuan, and the 10-count Red Double Horse has risen by 1,850 yuan. If there is a reaction in the future, there may be a drastic change. In addition, the price of 20-count yarn in other ports is around 7,500 or 7,600 yuan. Compared with the scheduled price, the difference is too far, so the actual demand needs to be completely suspended.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Eastern Piece Exceeds Expectations, the More It Rises, the More People Buy, the Ups and Downs of Leading Products Are Shocking, Surpassing the Four Gentlemen <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to the sharp rise in Eastern Piece, the cloth market continued to rise. 16-pound Earth coarse cloth was priced at 271 yuan, and Flying Goose was priced at 262 yuan, an increase of 45 yuan per piece compared to Saturday. 12-pound Earth fine cloth was priced at 245 yuan, and Fugui was priced at 242 yuan, an increase of about 5 to 7 yuan. Peach Blossom Lady Lin's highest price was 370 yuan, an increase of 8 yuan. Longevity Silk was priced at 7 yuan 8 and a half jiao. Volleyball yarn silk was quoted at 5 yuan 9 jiao to 6 yuan, also an increase of 1 or 2 jiao.</p>
<p>Outside the industry, hoarders of Eastern cloth buy more as the price rises, and the gap between factory orders and spot goods is also widening. Market transactions have become completely speculative. The leading fine cloth opened in the morning at 302 yuan, and the highest price reached 320 yuan, a difference of as much as 18 yuan per piece, and the range of ups and downs was truly shocking. The reason is that when it opened in the morning, the price of Double Horse yarn fell back, and the new order for the leading product opened at 302 yuan, and the situation was still soft, but soon after, many bulls outside the industry came to frantically drag the price up, raising the noon closing price to 32 yuan. In the afternoon, it started at 310 yuan, rose to a high of 320 yuan, then fell back to 314 and a half yuan, and after the close, it rose again to 315 and a half yuan, an increase of 12 yuan per piece. However, the bank order for the leading product was only 265 yuan, and the spot goods on the floor had to be 5 to 10 yuan less before they could be easily sold, which is really puzzling. Furthermore, the red single trading of the Four Gentlemen serge is more active than the leading product, rising and falling suddenly, with thousands of changes. Yesterday morning, the opening price was 10 yuan 005 points, which quickly rose to 10 yuan 03 jiao, then returned to 10 yuan 02 jiao. The noon closing price was as high as 10 yuan 04 jiao 2 fen. The after-market started at 10 yuan 03 jiao 7 points, fell to 10 yuan 02 jiao, and the highest peak reached 10 yuan 08 jiao and a half, then fell to 10 yuan 06 jiao and a half, and the closing price was shouted at 10 yuan 07 jiao, with buyers, about 5 and a half jiao higher than last week's market price.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Government Bonds Market: Stormy Weather, Types C and E Fall by Four Yuan, Hitting the Limit, with Unprecedented Rapid Fluctuations <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>The government bond grey market continued to plummet yesterday. Types C and E each fell by more than four yuan and hit the limit. Type E even broke the 50 yuan mark, and Type D also broke the 50 yuan mark, seeing a low price of 48 and a half yuan. The tragic decline made people unable to predict it. It is like a beautiful flower being destroyed by wind and rain, but fortunately, there are still people who know how to cultivate it. However, no one knows when the storm will end. It must wait until the wind stops and the rain clears before the clouds disperse and the sun shines. Yesterday, Tongli sold about 2 million yuan, and Hu Heji and Dakangcheng also sold 500,000 yuan. The rest were Tongkang, Jiufeng, Tongyuan, Lianhe, and general scalping transactions. Tongshun bought the most, with nearly 1 million yuan. Next was Qianyi, which also took in a lot. Hengyu, Zhenhua, and Zhongyi were also quite strong. The rest were Chengkang, Lianyi, Yuanhe, Xinji, Huichang, Runde, Shunli Dechang, and general retail investors buying in. The atmosphere was tense, the market was crowded, the competition was fierce, and the rapid fluctuations in market prices were unprecedented. Currently, it is still in the midst of wind and rain. The market price results were unanimously down sharply, with Types C and E each down four yuan, and the rest down from one yuan two jiao to three yuan one jiao. The transaction volume was about 3.12 million yuan. The list is briefly shown below: Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day Tongjia 61.75 59.50 61.70 Down 1.3 Tongyi 55.40 51.50 53.0 Down 3.10 Tongbing 6.0 2.20 12.2 Down 4.0 Tongding 51.5 48.50 50.0 Down 2.0 Tonge 52.3 49.50 49.5 Down 4.0</p>

<p>Cash Has No Major Changes</p>
<p>The cash market continued to rise, continuing the upward trend of the weekend, but there were those who wanted to sell to obtain cash, resulting in the daily fluctuations still being small, and people's hearts were quite stable. It started high at 400 yuan in the morning, totaling 21,600 yuan, and was dragged in by retail investors, rising to 21,700 yuan. Due to tight money supply, a certain money shop, silver shop, and securities firm sold, gradually falling to 21,500 yuan. The Jin Gang was inconsistent in its inflow and outflow, with the cash shop and a certain gang paying less, raising it to 21,650 yuan. A certain silver shop still sold, and the final transaction price was 21,600 yuan, 400 yuan higher than last Saturday's price, with a difference of 200 yuan. It rose to 21,700 yuan after the close, and the transaction was still active.</p>
<p>The goldsmith shops and jewelry shops initially raised the price of gold by 50 yuan per tael, totaling 2,250 yuan, but immediately returned to a flat price of 2,200 yuan (with a reduction of 200 yuan for purchases). Silver was priced at 18 yuan, and the black market price was 15 yuan 67 jiao. A silver coin was priced at 9 yuan 45 jiao.</p>

The premium for reserve tickets was, at most, 4 jiao and 2 fen per yuan, then 3 jiao and 7 fen.</p>
<p>Paper Money: Spot Money Is Hoarded. Although the price of foreign rice has increased, and the unit for buying rice has increased, the supply of spot money has not yet been plentiful and is still being hoarded. However, a major tool has been lost. Those who buy and sell with currency are never idle, so they have turned to paper money, which has been quiet for a long time. There have been many rumors in recent days, and it has already seen a slight rise yesterday. At a time when prices are soaring, the cost of living is increasing, and livelihoods are shrinking, in order to take care of the overall situation and preserve vitality, it is advisable not to pick and choose again and again.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains Arrive and Sell in Small Quantities</p>
<p>Bean Market Conditions: There were no major changes yesterday. Arrivals and sales were all in small quantities. Supply and demand were still balanced, and the market trend was slightly upward.

Another 30 bags of sand red were priced at 228 yuan, and 80 bags of Tianjin Jinyuan were priced at 250 yuan.</p>
<p>Corn arrivals and sales are not deserted, and the market presents a stable trend. Yesterday, one car of Wuhu corn was opened at a price of 182 yuan, more than 100 bags of Nanjing corn were priced at 181 yuan, and one car of Chuzhou corn was priced at 182 yuan.</p>
<p>Black Fungus Falls by 200 Yuan</p>
<p>Black fungus has recently been sluggish in actual sales, so even though the bottom inventory is thin, the market price has fallen, such as Gaozhuang fungus being sold for 3,200 or 3,300 yuan, a drop of 100 yuan compared to the previous evening.</p>

<p>— Ge Liang</p>
<p>In a remote place, two mice met. After a brief greeting, they got straight to the point. "Does your landlord have rice?" "No!" "My house doesn't either. Last night, I searched for six hours before finding a single grain." "This is what they call 'every grain is hard-earned'." "So I deliberately bite the landlord's utensils and clothes, making holes in every piece of clothing." "Liu Zihou's room has no intact utensils, and his clothes are not intact. His diet mostly consists of what the mice leave behind," this is what it means." "Why haven't I seen you for three days, and I don't understand a word you're saying? What are you taking from your landlord's house for food?" "Books. Because my landlord's house is bare, except for books, there's nothing else. So I eat books for three meals a day." "No wonder you look so shabby. But I heard people say that books are useless... what? I advise you, it's better to eat fewer books." "The east wind wrinkles a pool of spring water, what's it to you?" "So what do books taste like?" "There's a taste like meat in books. Speaking of meat, let me tell you: my landlord is always either shouting that he hasn't tasted meat for three months, or chanting about going home to eat meat, and now he suddenly wants to eat mouse meat, it's really wishful thinking." "People eat mouse meat? I've never heard of it." "You're really making a fuss over nothing! To examine historical facts, digging up rats and netting sparrows, there was Su Wu in the Han Dynasty, and Zhang Xun in the Tang Dynasty. Last night, he held a knife waiting, and as soon as he saw me, he walked towards me, so I took the best of the Thirty-Six Strategies, clutched my head and scurried away, escaping without a trace." "Hmm!"</p>

<p>A: "Look, the third-class carriage is empty, but those people insist on squeezing into the first-class carriage, where they can't even stand up straight." B: "That's because people love crowds!"</p>
<h3 id="e52">A Good Comparison <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Jinghai</p>
<p>Stepping into the photo studio, I was irritated by the crowd of people. I went to have a two-and-a-half-inch photo taken for my graduation certificate, which was said to be available in four days. Okay, four days it is. But now it's the sixth day.</p>
<p>As usual, I squeezed in and gave the clerk my photo receipt.</p>
<p>"Two or three more days." Heavens, two or three more days! "How is it possible that taking a two-inch photo takes nine days? In the past, a half-dozen registration photos cost at most five or six jiao, and they were available the next day. Now it costs four yuan to take only four photos, why do you need two or three more days?" I said angrily.</p>
<p>"Isn't it so? In the past, a dan of rice could be bought for a dozen yuan, and it could be delivered to your door. Now, half a liter of rice costs five yuan, and you have to wait in line in the middle of the night to get it, and whether you can buy it is still a question. Two or three more days, it's two or three more days, like milling rice, please come and run another trip in two or three days."</p>
<p>I could only give the humorous clerk a wry smile.</p>
<h3 id="e53">About Puppet Shows <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Man Shan</p>
<p>Speaking of puppets, they were invented quite early in China. I remember that when Emperor Gaozu of Han, Liu Bang, was trapped in Baideng City, his strategist Chen Ping knew that Modun's wife was jealous, so he used a wooden sculpture of a beautiful woman to force the henpecked general away. As for puppet shows, I could still see them in my childhood. They were many wooden puppets less than a foot long, with various masks hanging outside, performed by an actor who put two fingers in the clothes. After one came on stage, explained things clearly, and was inserted on the edge of the stage of less than three feet square, then the second one came back to the same method. The lines of the characters were all handled by the person behind the scenes, which seemed to be very laborious. At that time, hiring him for half a day only cost a few jiao. People who made a living in this line were all wandering friends, and now speaking of it, they should be considered directors.</p>
<p>The above is what I remembered after seeing the news that the "Shanghai Puppet Theater Troupe" was established. Times have changed, and there has been significant progress in the manufacture of puppets. According to reports, "Not only can they dance to the rhythm of the music, but their eyes can also open and close as needed according to the environment, and their lips can also move like living beings when speaking." I heard that the director is Ge Tuolin, a famous German film director, and many Jewish experts are involved. Although I have not witnessed the performance, it must be much better than the wandering friends—that is, more realistic.</p>
<p>In fact, more than ten years ago, wasn't there a lot of fancy stages in the Six Horse Road area? They could not only perform joke dramas such as "The Emperor's Night Out," but also handle the three volumes of "Iron Rooster" with real knives and guns with ease. Now, repeating the old tune, it feels novel again. This is like after the automobile is eliminated, the bicycle also comes into the limelight, it is truly a case of "one time is one time."</p>
<h3 id="e54">Zongtang Zeng's Good Words in a Chaotic World <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Lu</p>
<p>In this chaotic world, even great wealth and high status are unreliable. Only diligence and thrift can last.</p>
<p>Although the body is weak, in times of great difficulty, if one can endure the hardships of wind and frost, and work hard with a troubled mind, one will naturally strengthen one's bones and lengthen one's knowledge.</p>
<p>In this chaotic world, to have a period of leisure is extremely difficult, so never miss such good times.</p>
<p>In this chaotic world, the less money one has, the more one can avoid disaster. The less one spends, the longer one can last.</p>
<p>Do not exhaust your blessings, do not exhaust your power. (Yet rewarded)</p>
<h3 id="e55">The Lamp Thief <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Lou Jianhua</p>
<p>Probably because the times are extraordinary, the brains of ordinary people have also developed accordingly. Almost no method of making money is overlooked. Recently, every time the dawn is slightly bright, I am always awakened by bursts of noise. At first, I didn't pay attention to it, but today I heard the crying and commotion of the alleyway mom, and I learned that the light bulbs in the alley were stolen. The power poles in our alley are at least three zhang tall, and I heard that they were guarded until after two o'clock last night. Our alley is very long, estimated to have one to thirty light bulbs. For four consecutive days, the number is indeed considerable. I think that since the lamp thief has superb skills, he must want to make a big splash. Alleyway people who have not been patronized should pay special attention to this intangible loss. (Yet rewarded)</p>

<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(5) Repay Kindness with Kindness</p>
<p>Wei Cheng really couldn't say a word, he just held Guo Qi's hand tightly and nodded to Guo Fang. Guo Qi said, "It's really unexpected. In just a month of separation, the changes in personnel have reached this point." Wei Cheng said, "Isn't it so?" While speaking, he led them to a room west of Madam Ye's bedroom. The relatives and friends of the Ye family were eating and drinking happily. One person turned his face to look, and then everyone turned their faces to look, whispering, "Who are this man and woman? Young Master Ye personally welcomed them out. They must not be ordinary people."</p>
<p>Arriving in that room, Wei Cheng hung their brother and sister's coats on the coat rack. A magpie rushed in and called, "Miss Chen, you've finally come today. Miss Cui Zhen and us have all been thinking about Miss Chen." Guo Fang smiled at the magpie and said, "Magpie, thank you. You must have been very busy these few days, right?" Wei Cheng said, "You brother and sister sit down. Guo Fang, don't be perfunctory with the magpie. Are you coming from Shanghai, or from Shuangqiao?" Guo Fang suddenly waved to the doorway and said, "Sister Cui Zhen, come!" Guo Qi and Wei Cheng turned to look and saw Cui Zhen with a white cloth cheongsam draped over her shoulders, her head was sticking in, and her feet were still outside. Called by Guo Fang, she walked into the room shamedly and said, "Miss Chen, please sit. Is this Mr. Chen?" Guo Fang hurried up and shook her hand, saying, "This is my brother. Brother, this is Sister Cui Zhen. She is the only general manager of internal affairs at Mr. Ye's residence."</p>
<p>Guo Qi, Guo Fang, Wei Cheng, and Cui Zhen all sat down casually. This room was originally planned by Wei Cheng to be used as a female guest reception room, so the room inside was the female guest bedroom. Guo Qi smiled and said, "My sister has only been here once, but she's much more familiar than I am. The last time my sister came here, I was sick. Later, when she returned to Shuangqiao, she said that Wei Cheng had suffered a great misfortune. We brother and sister truly lamented, and we all cursed that the heavens were ignorant. At that time, I wanted my sister to accompany me to comfort you, but my grandmother refused, firstly because my illness had not recovered, and secondly because she said that my monthly building was unfavorable, and I should not go to a funeral home this month." Wei Cheng said, "Later, it was the start of school, and you all had to go back to Shanghai." Guo Qi said, "Yes, we went to Shanghai, and we've been attending classes for a week."</p>
