<h3 id="c1">糧食 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>糧食！目前上海最嚴重的問題——</p>
<p>糧食的問題，一天嚴重一天的影響着民衆的生活，在今天無論是誰，無不迫切地感釗糧食的問題有待於迅速和適當的解決？</p>
<p>以上海來說，過去並不是最缺糧食的地方，因爲它的四週，都是產米之鄕，再加它的交通便捷，原無庸憂愁米的缺乏，過去所慮的是米商國積，操縱市價，增加民衆生活的負担，造成社會的不安。不過，現在的情形不同，當局對於民間食米，已經依照統制的計劃，實行配給制度，因此，目前發生的米的嚴重的問題，和過去的米荒問題米價飛漲問題已經有着完全不同的情勢！</p>
<p>現在米的問題，其嚴重性到了什麽程度呢？就一般市民食米的實情而言，他們是在配給制下領取戶口米，每人每十日可買一升半（大約大米一升，碎米半升，又麵粉一斤半。）平均起來，每人每日可買米一合半，又麵粉二兩餘。依中國人民一般的體質而論，每人至少每日食米半升，不能再少了；那麼，依照現在的配給制，他們所可領到的戶口米，至多還只敷半數。至於米的價格，和他們的收入是否相符，還沒有作嚴密的比較！那麽，上海市民是怎樣維特生活呢？一般赤貧的掙扎在生死終上，不必再說，其餘差堪自給的，除了領取比較廉價的戶口米以外，便只有向馬路小販購買零米，可是，××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××，這樣日增夜長的數字，除了威脅上海市民的生活外，當然，它還會影響到社會的前途」</p>
<p>因爲米價的驚人在漲的數字，實在具有着嚴角的意義！這種嚴重的意義，在過去是不會感釗的。因爲，過去米價漲，影響還不普遍，首先是因爲去年上海市民幾乎每冢都有積米，米價高漲，儘可不管，過得一天算一天，現在可不同了，上海民間的存糧早已吃完了。其次，從前上海糧食缺少了，可由四鄕運入接濟，可是，現在有限制了，來源方面旣有了這種新的變化；要求米價的减跌，幾乎是很少希望了。但是上海一般市民的實際收入，却無法充分解決生活問題：</p>
<p>第一，如上面所說的，戶口米只敷民食需要的一半，其餘一半就得出高價向黑市購買，以昨天市價計算，譬如一家四口二大二小，僅米一項，每家每日即至少十元左右！以上海一般市民的職業狀况而言，誰都担負不起。</p>
<p>其次，我們知道，上海市民，除了絕少數富裕者之外，最大多數是上海社會之實際的支持者—薪水階級，也就是所謂「隱貧」階級；决多數就是赤貧」階級，所以，我們决不能因爲看到許多大酒樓打飯店之「座上客常滿，樽中酒不空而就忽視了　個上海糧食問題的嚴重性，因爲前者是絕少數富有者造成的虛浮的繁一榮一，這種「繁榮是建基在沙漠上面的，而且是非生產性的。而後者—廣大的市民却在「隱貧」「赤貧」中掙扎着，爲嚴重的食糧問題而痛苦着。</p>
<p>第三，一般薪水階級，雖然有津貼，似乎可以補助多少；但是，要知道津貼都按照物價指數增减，而所謂物價指數却是按照工部局官定米價來計算的。試思目前戶口米每升一元半與零買米×××××××價的比例，那麼，津貼所能補助的實際意義之程度，也不難想像了。</p>
<p>第四，我們還不能忽視更重要的事實，就是黑市米價如此飛漲，同時刺激上海其他各種物價，不僅增加了市民的生活負担，不僅使物價統制政策遭遇到執行上的阻礙，而且還刺激上海以外和平區的米價和一切物價，它的影響之大，幾乎是不易估計的</p>
<p>第五，也是最重要的就是由於以米價飛漲爲中心的物價層層上漲，必然會由經濟的危機，發展到政治的危機，所以就不應忽視！</p>
<p>關於食糧問題的對策，相信當局已在籌謀賢明正確的辦法了，我們站在中國人民的立塲上認爲下列幾點，是非常迫切的，所以敢對當局作芹蒭之獻：</p>
<p>第一，是設法增加配給量：以上所說，現在每人所可領到的户口米，只敷每人實際需要的一半，以致每人不能不要求從戶口米之外別求補充，而不得不作自己力量所不逮的支出，以致增加了食糧漲價的嚴重性。所以希望增加戶口米的配給量，每人至少每日可領半升，對於勞働階級，還特別酌量增加。這樣便可大大的减了食糧問題的嚴重性；同時也可以制止其他物價之漲風，而便利物價統制政策之推行。對於社會和政治上的有利影響也就不容過低估計了。</p>
<p>第二，我們更希望使「額外配給」普遍化，這也可以相當地减少了食糧間　的嚴重性。</p>
<p>第三，是再度認眞實施疏散人口，尤其是對於無職業而有鄉可歸的，應在更妥善，更便利的辦法之下，積極推行，只要辦法妥善，並且給疏散者以更多的便利，尤其在手續上勿過多限制與周折，那麽成績就不會過低。這樣，一方面，可以减輕上海食糧問題的嚴重性，另方面就可以使這些無職業的人同鄕參加生產事業，參加食糧增產，具有着積極的意義。</p>
<p>此外，如果暫時不能增加配給量，就可先行允許小販自由販賣，並規定價格不得超過戶口米價目的兩倍，我們記得六月份改用新法幣時，上海米價黑市每石舊幣五百元，合新幣應爲二白五十元，×××××××××××××××××。而依目前滬抗滬寗兩路綫各城市的米價來看，大都還只在三百元以內，所以對自由販賣價格在戶口米價兩倍以內，或四百元以內，對於販賣者也已有利可圖，不失之苛了。</p>
<p>我們認爲糧食問題是今日上海最嚴重的問題，而且和整個和平區的經濟與政治有密切的關係，希望各方面趕快協力求得徹底的解決。</p>

<p>遠在二十七年二月五日，重慶政權敎育部，曾頒行「公立專科以上學校戰區學生貸金暫行辨法」，規定貸金，分爲。</p>
<p>（甲）全額　每月八元或十元，</p>
<p>（乙）半額　每月四元或五元。</p>
<p>嗣後生活費用，日趨高漲，屢加修正，現行辦法，則爲：</p>
<p>（一）戰區學生膳食貸金，分：甲等—給予原籍淪陷而經濟完全斷絕者，每月貸金爲基數十八元，及其以外之數額</p>
<p>（二）自費學生輔助貸金，分。</p>
<p>甲等—給予家境淸貧而原籍未淪陷者，貸金數額同（一）項乙等，</p>
<p>乙等—給予經濟狀况較困難者，貸金數額爲甲等之半。</p>
<p>膳食貸金，初爲固定數額，嗣因米價隨時上漲，因定數額不足以維持學生之營養，乃改爲按照當地米價，每人以二市斗一市升折算，另加油，鹽，菜蔬，燃料，及廚工等費川。以七月間川省物價估計，政府對一全膳貸金學生所負之費用，爲每月九十元至一百元，年約一千三百元左右，即以戰區乙等或自費甲等計算，政府之負擔爲每人七八十元，年的千元，僅以甲乙等兩種貸金而言，年費已不下五千萬元，此外，尚有特別貸金·零用貸金·制服貸金等，皆爲救濟戰區貧苦學生而設者。</p>
<p>支忖之貸學金數額，不可謂不大，表面上似乎已盡維護敎育之能事，但事實不然，各大學學生發生種種不滿現象，推原其故，在於執行者措施之不妥，依據調査所得，一般感覺失當之處，約有七端，</p>
<p>（一）在拖戰長期化後，學生經濟能力爲之有無，不能單純以「淪陷區」或「非淪陷區」劃分，往往有家雖在非「淪陷區」，而經濟上却十分困難之學生，亦有家雖在「淪陷區」，而其父兄在內地已另有經濟基礎之學生，於此不能澈底明瞭學生之家庭背景，而一味依呆板之條文行事，不平之事，殆屬難免</p>
<p>（二）若干學校規定，凡有滙款之學生，不能貸金，此雖不失爲一種限制辦法，但不加調查詳盡，頗有誤會之處，例如某一學生收到朋友托轉之滙款信，學校當局，即據以取消其貸金資格，殊達反立法之本意</p>
<p>（三）又有規定凡曾記過者，不滙貸金，此雖含有懲惡獎善之意，但在敎育原理上，應予靑年以自新之機會。</p>
<p>（四）學生呈請貸金，手續繁多，過於麻煩，公文又屢此周轉，往往暨時數月，使眞正需要補助之學生，十分感覺痛苦</p>
<p>（五）管理貸金機構，對於呈請貸金學生之審査，有碍於　面，取捨欠當之事，致應得者未得，不應得者反得，外間且盛傳敎授利用貸金拉攏學生，或學生以貸金陪愛人看電影。吃館子·之事。</p>
<p>（六）貸金發放時間，有時拖延太久，甚至有在四五月間而尚在發一二月份貸金者，如果學生完全依賴貸金吃飯，必有斷炊之虞。</p>
<p>（七）若干處所，浮報貸金生名額，可以冒領貸金，或故意抑發貸金，用作投資國積之不道德行爲，可謂爲淸高學府中之怪現象。</p>
<p>關於貸金制度之本身，原無間言，惟執行方面，無公正·廉潔·精審·迅速·四要點，故流弊不可勝言，徒然糟塌有用之金錢，敎育靑年者如此，又何忍苛責靑年，故大學生，生活不能安定，自必影響學業，程度之所以低落，此亦爲因素之一也。</p>

<h3 id="c20">大戰下的東亞經濟懇談會　十一月廿六日東京讀買報知 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>從本月二十六日起，即將舉行第四次東亞經擠懇談會，愼重懇談並討論有關東亞經濟之種種問題。東亞經濟懇談會，於昭和十四年（中華民國二十八年）十二月以來，每年舉行一次，至今業已開過了二次，今年乃是共第四次，在這大東亞戰爭勃發以來，正是首逢其會，不用說，是含有重大的意義的。歷次的懇談會，例由大藏，外務兩大臣出席，今年則總理大臣，大東亞省大臣，以及陸海軍報道部長等，均將參與其會，這也是此次懇談會在現時局勢下値得特別重視的所在。</p>
<p>隨着大東亞戰爭的發展，東亞經濟圈已非常擴大了，把安南，泰國，緬甸，南洋各地，均包含在內。在東亞經濟懇談會中，不久當可以看到這些地方的代表也來出席吧，可是這次還仍由滿洲國，華中，華北，蒙疆，日本等代表舉行懇談。</p>
<p>昭和十五年（民國廿九年十一月內閣情報部發表之日華滿經濟建設要綱及同年九月閣議決定之國土計劃設定要綱，均係指日華滿三國爲建設東亞圈之中樞，而南方各地，亦預定在內。無論從建設的歷史來講，從南方各地主要的供給資材之點來講，日華滿三國應爲東亞經濟建設的中樞，雖在今天，這原則依然不變。東亞經濟懇談會的目的，在於謀日華滿及其他東亞諸地的經濟融合，並努力促使其綜合的經濟力的强化，所以對於業已擴大了的東亞經濟圈的建設，亦當爲三國代表所懇談的要題吧。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭勃發之前，世界各國，並不相信日本必會於日美交涉之中屈從美國的要求，以爲日本即使起而反抗，亦屬必然的於頃刻之間爲强大的美國軍力所擊敗。然而日本却在短時間內，竟戡定了南方諸地，更由太平洋進迫印度洋，造成了不能撼動的形勢。可是他們則還不肯放棄美國最後勝利的夢想，却跟着這個夢想而開始建立了所謂長期戰略。現在美國作成了龐大的軍備計劃；重慶則猶在自力抗戰的名目之下，頒布了國家總動員法，着手開發西北，從事建設渝印公路，以謀苟延其政權。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭是長期戰爭，中國事變亦須在大東亞戰爭完成後而得到解決，日本目前正在那樣堅決的意志之下，向着完成戰爭之途猛進。</p>
<p>所以在這樣情勢之下，東亞經濟圈所負的責任是非常重大的。單需些建設等等那樣不够積極的話早已不能容許了。它是必須直接分担一翼的重要責任，爲完成大東亞戰爭而增强戰力。此即大東亞戰爭開始後，東亞經濟懇談會所負第一個重大的意義與責任。</p>
<p>華中，華北，滿洲，蒙疆的現狀，果然已培養到能完成這重大的責任的實力了嗎？懇談會是不應單講些懇談或親睦的話就算完畢的，應該切切實實地照着深刻的時局的要求而爲之善謀才是。（丁譯）</p>
<h3 id="c21">有望於東亞經濟懇談會者　—十一月二十八日東京朝日新聞— <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>東亞經濟懇談會第四次大會，將於日•華·滿•蒙•各地代表多數出席之下，在十一月二十六日至二十八日之間，接連舉行三天，其盛况當不難想像的。</p>
<p>該會對於日•華·滿·蒙·的經濟建設，貢獻極多。此次爲大東亞戰爭發生以後首逢其會的第一次，覺得它的意義和責任，更加來得重大。不用說，該懇談會的目的，是在促進經濟提携；即前來參與其會的各地經濟界人士，於濟濟聚首一堂之際，將彼此誠懇地商籌東亞經濟的卞策，疏通相互之意見，以資建設東亞新秩序。然而同時想把我國（日本）的政治·經濟。文化·等各方面的現實情形，趁此機會，給與各地來會的經濟界人士，以一個正確的認識，當亦是重要目的之一。</p>
<p>當然，這些目標在中國事變發展到成爲大東亞戰爭的今日，依舊一點沒有失去它的重要性。不但如此，在這大東亞戰爭之下，尤其非把這成爲東亞新秩序中心之日•華•滿•蒙·的諒解與經濟的協力，加以强調不可。自然，它的內容，必須與先前有所不同。即自與美英開戰以來，由於皇軍的赫赫戰果，使東亞新秩序擴展到大東亞共榮圈，使它的包攝範圍，無論地區的·人種的·都變得非常廣大·因之一向爲日•華•滿•蒙•·間所討論的物資之生產·配給·消費·以及運輸·金融·物價等等的重要問題，也非從這個觀點重新加以檢討不可。又對於前來參加新的東亞新秩序建設聖業的各地域，如何也把他們邀入這個懇談會中，這點也非加以考慮不可。</p>
<p>希望出席本年經濟懇談會者，鑒於大會所負的重要使命，應該把眞誠的意念，集中於擊滅美英的一點之上，以期對於完成大東亞戰爭的物質與精神兩力面的協力，都沒有，一點遺憾，趁道機會，來一新打到英美的決意。（丁譯）</p>

<h3 id="c45">一年來的大東來戰爭（三） <a href="#c45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>（十二）南太平洋各戰役</p>
<p>於是，戰事更向前發展，向確保日本佔領地區和消滅英美任何反攻可能的前途進展了。</p>
<p>首先在一月間，是俾士麥羣島的進攻。一月二十三日，在新波利敦島登陸，同時又在新愛爾蘭島登陸。二十六日展開新波利敦島的總攻，不久，附近各島嶼完全佔領。尤其是拉伐島爾與卡皮安恩哥兩要衝的佔領，使日本在南太平洋戰略上的形勢更爲有利，尤其是使美國與澳洲的聯絡切斷一點成功最大。一方面，對於新幾尼亞西方帝莫爾島的攻氣，也很進展，使日軍對新　尼亞的包圍圈的效力日益增加。二月二十日就完成了帝莫爾島的登陸。荷印與澳洲間的交通都在日軍黨握中了。</p>
<p>日軍在東方佔領俾士麥羣島，在西卞進駐帝莫爾島，形成了對新幾尼亞的夾攻之氣。接着三月八日日軍即在新幾尼亞登陸。</p>
<p>三月三十一日，日軍開始莫爾卡諸島及新幾尼亞西北的攻略，四月十九日，就把西部新幾尼亞所有要點完全佔領了。西部勘定後，即由北向南推進，進迫東部新幾尼亞。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭發展到五個月的時候，東自蘇羅門，西至新布利敦，都爲日軍佔領。四月十九日，完成了新幾尼亞西部的戡定戰，於是西南太平洋的英美勢力，已經驅逐殆盡，而澳洲也開始感受到重大的威脅。尤其是日軍佔領了蘇門答臘，爪哇，帝莫爾，新幾尼亞，新布利敦諸島，一連四千　的地域，對於澳洲已形成無可抵抗的威脅，而美國太平洋南進攻略也就　摧毀了。</p>
<p>（十三）印度洋的控制</p>
<p>新加坡和蘇門答臘被日軍攻陷以後，印度洋已成爲日本海空軍的競技塲了。</p>
<p>首先是對聖誕島的攻擊，聖誕島在巽他海峽以南二百二十哩，自日軍遮斷麻利加海峽以來，該島就成為印度與澳洲運輸的中心。三月一日，日本開始空襲了破壞了該島唯一的港灣FF灣和英美聯合艦隊的設施。日本海軍於三月七日開始向該島攻擊，三十一日曰軍就完全佔領，切斷了印澳　　聯絡。</p>
<p>另一方面，日軍又於三月十七日開始進攻西南太平洋一帶要地安達曼諸島。這是新加坡和印度間的連絡中心，與馬達拉斯，加爾喀答，和哥倫在等距離相當，可說是日度國防上的屛落。二十四日進攻依蒲洛克，安爾芬登斯島。於是東印度洋上最大的要衝　入日軍之手，印度本國的東岸和錫蘭島已經裸露在日軍砲火威脅之下了。</p>
<p>終於，對印度本土的襲擊也開始了，四月五日日海軍部隊開始向印度洋英國最大軍事據點錫蘭島的首都哥倫布進攻，破壞了所有英國艦艇，船舶和航空兵力。六日，日軍的鋒刃已迫近印度本土，向馬德拉期州北部的要衝可卡拿大，及啓卡克樂實行空襲，自此對印空襲，幾乎不斷的進行。哥倫布和珠林可馬利兩軍港是新加坡失陷後英國最東端的軍事據點，爲死守其寶庫印度的前哨陣地，自緬甸經加爾喀答至錫蘭島，廣大的孟加拉水域，全在其控制之下。自這兩地處於日軍轟炸之下以後，印英軍事當局就不能不驚慌失措。現在印度和澳洲的交通，幾乎完全切斷，而印度與美國間的連絡也陷於危急狀態；而南非聯邦的地位也就開始被人注意。大東亞戰爭從此又和歐菲兩州的戰爭進入直接發生關係的時期了。</p>
<p>（十四）進襲美國本土</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭是含有世界性的戰爭，因此，戰爭一開始，就不限於太平洋的防禦，而向美國本土凖備着攻擊了。十二月八日上午九時三十分，美國廣播中就報告，舊金山西約一千三百浬地點航行中的美國運輸艦隊，遭受潛艇的攻擊，共中兩艘沉沒，從這裏可見美國太平洋沿岸的海上交通，早已遭受日本潛艇的威脅了。十二月十一日，美國海軍當局又報告日本潛艇在美國太平洋岸活動，美國運油船兩艘被擊。到了十二月三十日，日本潛艇更在美國近海出沒，奇襲布洛港，卡夫而伊港，震驚了美國的海軍。</p>
<p>二月二十五日，日本大本營公佈日本潛艇於廿四日夜間，開始砲擊美國加利福尼亞洲沿岸的軍事設施，收到重大戰果。美國本土開始遭受攻擊，這是歷史上値得記載的大事。而在政治上對於美國人民心理的影響，更是不容忽視的。羅斯福總統於廿五日對記者團談話，也直率承認日本潛艇施擊美國本土是「優秀的政治謀略之一例」。</p>
<p>（十五）英美海軍反攻的慘敗</p>
<p>當英美荷在西南太平洋上的勢力慘遭崩潰的時候，立即在英美本國引起了人民的責難，英美軍事當局爲此發動了對日的「反攻」。</p>
<p>列如五月六日，新幾尼亞島方面作戰中的日本海軍部隊，在該島東南方珊瑚海上，發見英美聯合的有力艦隊，自七日起即加以反擊。據日本大本營公表說，英美企圖在夏威夷，澳洲及新幾尼亞間的南太平洋方面蠢動，所以一舉出動了美國最精銳的航空母艦二艘，配合了許多英美主力艦和驅逐艦，建立了强力的聯合艦隊，向珊瑚海面日方陣綫前進，但經過日方猛力反擊，敵艦大多遭遇覆沒」。</p>
<p>但是，英美的反攻宣傳仍在繼續進行着，日方爲澈底消滅一切威脅日本本土的可能起見，又自三月十九日起，展開了對重慶第三戰區浙贛綫的進攻，把英美所利用以威脅日本的玉山，麗水等地的飛機塲及一切設施加以破壞，徹底地消滅了空襲日本的可能。</p>
<p>（十六）東太平洋的作戰</p>
<p>從西方南方威脅日本本土的一切可能都被日方破壞以後，就開始對東北方面可能的威脅加以消滅，日本的海軍航空部隊，於六月四日開始襲擊阿留申羣島。七日日陸軍部隊與海軍緊密協力進攻阿留申擊島的軍事根據地基斯加島。</p>
<p>美國自從中央及南太平洋對日進攻路被破壞以後，就準備從阿拉斯加，以阿留申羣島作根據地，以圖襲擊日本本土，作爲北方進攻路。但該方面在冬季不能進行軍事，只有夏季有進攻的可能，所以日本就制敵機先，以陸軍協力攻略阿—基兩島，反而造成了對美國本土的威脅。六月二十日，日本潛艇又在加拿大附近砲擊朋友巴島，給加拿大人民以極大的衝動。</p>
<p>從此以後不僅西南太平洋已經成爲日本的海洋，就是東太平洋也成爲日本海空軍的活動區了。</p>
<p>（十七）由蘇羅門海戰到大西洋進軍</p>
<p>日海軍航空部隊，於八月七日在蘇羅門羣島方面發見英美聯合艦隊運輸船隊，八日，日海軍即給予殱滅的打擊。八月九日起，展開追擊戰。據十四日日本大本營發表，這次戰鬥　　收獲了世界史上無可倫比的大戰果。第一次蘇羅門海戰就這樣在日本絕對勝利中結束了。</p>
<p>然而接着是第二次蘇羅門犬戰。第一次大戰失敗之後，美國爲了挽回頹勢，振奮人心，出動了增援艦隊，於八月廿四日向蘇羅門羣島東之洋面挺進，但立即爲日方發現，當即發動航空隊，加以急　，給予重大的打擊。</p>
<p>從第二次蘇羅門大戰以後，日本更爭取主動第一次空襲美國本土。九月九日，日本水上飛機在美國太平洋岸奧倫根西南部海岸出現，投下燒夷彈，引起了大火，使美國四部人民爲之震　不安。後來五月下旬日本海軍更向大西洋活動了，於是亞歐的戰事，已經開始直接的合作了。</p>
<p>山蘇羅門海戰，到大西洋進軍，表現了大東亞戰爭的歷史的發展。</p>
<p>（十八）第三次蘇羅門海戰</p>
<p>美國雖屢戰屢敗，但沒有完全放棄反攻的野心，尤其是對於蘇羅門羣島—它不僅是澳洲的屛陣，而且是美國的前衝，它又是夏威夷和澳洲之間之最重要的交通中心，只要美國能控制蘇羅門一帶，牠就可以企圖重振西南太平洋的勢力。相反的，倘使蘇維門方面完全爲日軍所掌握，那末不僅澳洲將完全孤立，而夏威夷也失去了價値，即美國本身的直接威脅也大大的增加了。正因爲如此，所以美國不惜一切，一而再，再而三的收拾了他在西南太平洋的殘餘勢力，增加了新銳的海空軍，向這一方面實行猛力的反攻。自十月下旬起，尤其是十一月上旬，又集中一切力量向日軍淮撲，猛烈的戰爭　不斷地進行，日軍除了不斷給敵方以打擊之外，又於十三日起，開始主動的作戰，猛擊加達而卡那爾島。</p>
<p>自八月七日第一次蘇羅門戰爭至十一月十四日間三次蘇羅門大戰的結果，可以看到南太平洋上三次大戰的兇惡程度和日本怎樣以絕對的優勢保持着太平洋上主動的地位。</p>
<p>敵万之損失</p>
<p>飛機　自炸及未歸隊二〇六架，重傷三一架。</p>
<p>（根據十一月十九日凍京名報所載）</p>
<p>第三次蘇羅門大戰以後，美國顯然已經受到重大的打擊，反攻的能力問題已經在聯合國中間開始發生疑問。同時對於重慶政權所提出而由美國實行的這個太平洋上的第二戰綫的結果，竟是如此，自然，對於重慶政權內部又發生了政治上的動搖。</p>
<p>三戰爭前途的觀測</p>
<p>現在，當大東亞戰爭一週紀念而太平洋的形勢已經和一年前發生了根本的變化之時，我們來觀測這一戰爭的前途，是很有意義的，也可說是每一個亞洲國家的人民所必要認識的。</p>
<p>首先，回顧這一年間的戰爭中，勝敗的主要原因在什麼地方呢？在日本方面我們可以舉例出來的，第一是政治上的革新，主要是實現了舉國一致的新政治體制，使全國的一切政治力量，都向着唯一的目標—爭取大東亞戰爭勝利。尤其是在人力方面，日本沒有一個人民能够處身於戰事之外，也沒有一個人民能够不分擔戰事听賦予的責任，而且沒有一個人民不在政府一定的統率之下加倍的提供出自己的力量來爲大東亞戰爭而服勞。第二，是經濟上的集中，這首先表現在國家總動員的計劃的提前完成，表現在全國一切物力和財力完全依照政府的動員計劃而供給政府，使政府能够從容地支配這全國的物力和財力，以爭取戰爭的勝利。一切都有充分的準備，不做空言的宣傳。</p>
<p>其次，若英，若美及其同盟者又怎樣呢？從政治上來看，英美本身存在着決不能一致的矛盾性，英國政治上內在的矛盾，左派與右派的鬥爭，反邱吉爾的運動，親　派的活動，都表現出一個腐敗過程中的老大帝國主教政治上的「百孔千瘡」的醜態。正因爲這種醜態，造成了國策的凌亂，造成了國力的分散，不僅殖民地的人民開始走了求解放的途徑，而且本國人民也不能不為政府的無能而憤激了。美國的情形並不比英國的好得多少，在國內一切反戰派的活動，還有一派公開地反對羅斯福的親蘇參戰運動。因此，美國雖然具有全世界第一位的工業機構生產力，而實際上可利用以支持這次戰爭的，卻不能不大大的打個折扣。至於人民力量的結集之不可能，自更不待說了。</p>
<p>在外交政策和民族政策方面，英美更陷於空前的失幾之中，例如英美對蘇，本來就談不到誠意，高唱了一年多的「在歐洲開闢第二戰綫」終不發動。而英美卻還有一部份人認為和蘇聯合作，無非增加了英美的負擔，貽留未來的禍患。至於民族政策方面英美雖在一年以前就由羅邱擬定了所謂「大西洋憲章」，可是，在他們對待印度民族運動的實際措施中，已經自己招認，只不過是騙人的東西了。</p>
<p>我們把這大東亞戰爭中雙方的情形對照起來，戰爭前途的勝負，不是已經非常明顯了嗎？不過，我們還不能過於估低敵人的力量。我們應該認淸英國在這次大戰中，始終避免着主力的戰爭，他是一味無恥地退，退……。因此，也還保全着一部份的海軍力量。而美國呢，他是現代最大工業國家，內部固然也是百孔千瘡，但是道幾年來，他本國還沒有受到致命的打擊，却也是事實。因此在大東亞圈內的各國，還應該面對着這些現實，正視着這些現實，正確地認淸自己的地位和任務，加倍的努力去迎接新的時代的來臨。現在還不是狂歡的時候，現在還是我們忍受和迎接更大的苦難的時候！大家緊張起來，大家團結起來！努力奮鬥！　（完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Provisions <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Provisions! The most serious problem in Shanghai at present—</p>
<p>The problem of provisions is increasingly affecting the lives of the people day by day. Today, everyone urgently feels that the problem of provisions needs to be resolved quickly and appropriately.</p>
<p>In the case of Shanghai, it was not the most grain-deficient area in the past because it was surrounded by rice-producing regions. In addition, its convenient transportation meant there was no need to worry about a shortage of rice. The concern in the past was about rice merchants hoarding and manipulating market prices, increasing the burden on people's lives, and creating social unrest. However, the situation is different now. The authorities have implemented a rationing system for civilian rice according to a unified plan. Therefore, the current severe rice problem is completely different from the rice shortage and skyrocketing rice prices of the past!</p>
<p>To what extent is the current rice problem serious? In terms of the actual rice consumption of ordinary citizens, they receive household rice under the rationing system, with each person allowed to buy 1.5 *sheng* every ten days (approximately 1 *sheng* of rice, 0.5 *sheng* of broken rice, and 1.5 *jin* of flour). On average, each person can buy 1.5 *he* of rice and a little over 2 *liang* of flour per day. According to the general physique of the Chinese people, each person needs to eat at least 0.5 *sheng* of rice per day, and no less. Therefore, according to the current rationing system, the household rice they can receive is at most only half of what they need. As for whether the price of rice matches their income, no rigorous comparison has been made! So, how do the citizens of Shanghai maintain their lives? It goes without saying that the extremely poor are struggling on the brink of life and death. The rest, who can barely support themselves, can only buy small amounts of rice from street vendors in addition to receiving relatively cheap household rice, but ××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××. Such an increasing number will not only threaten the lives of Shanghai citizens, but of course, it will also affect the future of society.</p>
<p>Because the alarming increase in rice prices has real implications! This seriousness was not felt in the past. In the past, the rise in rice prices did not have a widespread impact, primarily because almost every household in Shanghai had stored rice last year. They could ignore the high rice prices and take each day as it came. This is no longer the case. The rice reserves of the people of Shanghai have long been exhausted. Secondly, in the past, when Shanghai was short of food, it could be supplied from the surrounding countryside. However, there are now restrictions, and there have been these new changes in the source of supply; there is almost little hope for a reduction in rice prices. However, the actual income of the general public in Shanghai cannot fully solve the problem of living:</p>
<p>First, as mentioned above, household rice only meets half of the people's food needs. The other half has to be purchased at high prices on the black market. Calculated at yesterday's market price, for example, a family of four, with two adults and two children, would spend at least ten yuan or so per day on rice alone! Given the employment situation of the general public in Shanghai, no one can afford it.</p>
<p>Secondly, we know that, except for a very few wealthy people, the vast majority of Shanghai citizens are the actual supporters of Shanghai society—the salaried class, also known as the "hidden poor" class; and the majority are the "destitute poor" class. Therefore, we must not ignore the seriousness of Shanghai's food problem just because we see that many large restaurants and hotels are "always full of guests and never empty of wine," because the former is a superficial prosperity created by a very few wealthy people. This "prosperity" is built on the desert and is unproductive. The latter—the vast number of citizens—are struggling in "hidden poverty" and "destitution," suffering from the serious food problem.</p>
<p>Third, although the general salaried class has subsidies, it seems that they can supplement their income to some extent; however, it should be known that subsidies are increased or decreased according to the price index, and the so-called price index is calculated according to the official rice price of the Public Works Department. If we consider the ratio between the current price of household rice at 1.5 yuan per *sheng* and the price of rice purchased in small quantities ×××××××, then it is not difficult to imagine the actual significance of the subsidies.</p>
<p>Fourth, we cannot ignore the more important fact that the soaring black market rice prices also stimulate other prices in Shanghai. This not only increases the living burden of citizens, but also encounters obstacles in the implementation of price controls, and also stimulates rice prices and all prices in peaceful areas outside Shanghai. The impact of this is almost impossible to estimate.</p>
<p>Fifth, and most importantly, the rising prices centered on soaring rice prices will inevitably lead to an economic crisis, which will develop into a political crisis, so it should not be ignored!</p>
<p>Regarding countermeasures to the food problem, I believe the authorities are already planning wise and correct measures. Standing from the position of the Chinese people, we believe that the following points are very urgent, so we dare to offer humble suggestions to the authorities:</p>
<p>First, find ways to increase the rationed quantity: As mentioned above, the household rice that each person can receive now only meets half of the actual needs of each person, so that each person has to seek supplements other than household rice and has no choice but to make expenditures beyond their means, which increases the seriousness of rising food prices. Therefore, we hope to increase the rationed quantity of household rice, so that each person can receive at least half a *sheng* per day. The amount should also be specially increased for the working class. This will greatly reduce the severity of the food problem; at the same time, it can also curb the rise in other prices and facilitate the implementation of price control policies. The beneficial impact on society and politics should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>Second, we further hope to make "extra rations" universal, which can also significantly reduce the severity of the food problem.</p>
<p>Third, re-implement population dispersal in earnest, especially for those who are unemployed and have a hometown to return to. It should be actively promoted under more appropriate and convenient measures. As long as the measures are appropriate and provide more convenience to those being dispersed, especially in terms of not having too many restrictions and complications in the procedures, then the results will not be too low. In this way, on the one hand, the severity of Shanghai's food problem can be reduced; on the other hand, these unemployed people can be allowed to participate in production in their hometowns, participate in increasing food production, which has positive significance.</p>
<p>In addition, if it is temporarily impossible to increase the rationed quantity, small vendors can first be allowed to sell freely, and it can be stipulated that the price should not exceed twice the price of household rice. We remember that when the new legal tender was introduced in June, the black market price of rice in Shanghai was 500 yuan in old currency per *shi*, which should be 250 yuan in new currency ×××××××××××××××××. According to the current rice prices in cities along the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Shanghai-Nanjing lines, most are still only within 300 yuan, so allowing free sales at a price within twice the household rice price, or within 400 yuan, would still be profitable for the vendors and not too harsh.</p>
<p>We believe that the food problem is the most serious problem in Shanghai today, and it is closely related to the economy and politics of the entire peaceful area. We hope that all parties will quickly work together to find a thorough solution.</p>

<p>General Abe Broadcasts: The Meaning of the Greater East Asia War</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Domei News Agency)—General Abe, President of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, delivered a radio address to the nation tonight on the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, stating briefly: The United States and Britain should understand the basic fact that the reason why they have been repeatedly defeated by Japan is because their cause is unjust. Japan is fighting not only for self-defense but also for the liberation of East Asia, to prevent the high ideals of Anglo-American aggression. In this war, the enemy countries have no purpose worth fighting for and no moral justification. They are only fighting at the behest of their leaders who are promoting a policy of aggression and oppression in East Asia. The current war is not a war of self-defense for the United States and Britain, but a war for them to maintain their policy of aggression in East Asia. The history and destiny of East Asia are all acts of Anglo-American aggression. In particular, the United States has no reason to annex Hawaii and the Philippines. The world knows that American missionaries extracted wealth from China, and the United States, in concert with Britain, attempted to prevent Japan's legitimate activities in China and incited the Chinese people against Japan. Since Britain and the United States did not end this policy of aggression, the Greater East Asia War broke out. Therefore, this war is a war of self-defense on the part of Japan and a war for the enemy to expand its power unnecessarily. Japan is now determined to fight, not only to defend its own survival but also to eliminate the Anglo-American domination of East Asia.</p>

<p>Berlin, 8th (Havas)—Bose, the leader of the pro-Axis Indian Nationalist Party, delivered a radio speech to the Indian people today, stating briefly: The war is trending toward a favorable opportunity for the Axis countries.

The United States' post-war plan does not include an independent status for India. We have confidence in the future of the war. Therefore, every Indian national must redouble their efforts to resist Britain and the United States.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Liu Jianxu Under Detention <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency)—According to reliable sources, Liu Jianxu, Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government and Deputy Commander of the Third War Zone, was detained by the Chongqing authorities on charges of violating military discipline after reporting on the local military and political situation at the Tenth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee. He is currently under strict interrogation. According to Liu Jianxu's reasons for arrest, there are two: (1) He often had disagreements with Chen Zhao, the Fujian Provincial Supervisor, leading to local administrative disputes. (2) The Fujian Three People's Principles Youth League and local tycoons accused Liu of protecting opium cultivation and other crimes. However, it is generally believed that the main reason for Liu's arrest is that the organizational structure of Fujian Province has always been extremely complex, and the local tycoons in the province most opposed Liu's policies. Therefore, the Supreme National Defense Council recently designated the province as a military strategic area and is carrying out large-scale military construction. In order to avoid obstacles to the advance of the Zhili faction into Fujian Province, the Chongqing authorities arrested Liu Jianxu. This is the fundamental motive.</p>

<p>Gil, 9th (Haitong News Agency)—Moroccan radio announced yesterday that a tank battle has been taking place near Tebourba for two days. The outcome is unclear.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 8th (Domei News Agency)—Since the Battle of Tebourba, the war situation in northern Tunisia has turned to the advantage of the Axis forces. An eight-day London broadcast also stated that if the Axis forces now secure their transport routes and are protected by strong air force, the Allied forces have no hope of counterattacking. The recent war situation is described as follows: (1) After the Allied forces abandoned Tebourba, the main forces immediately withdrew to the southwest and quickly mobilized reinforcements in an attempt to reverse the decline. The Axis forces launched a simultaneous air and land attack. Since the start of the tank battle on the 7th, the main forces of the two armies have entered a state of melee. According to reports from the United Nations side, the fiercest battle since the start of the war in Tunisia has now begun. (2) The Axis has completely secured the railway and coastline between Tunis and Bizerte. The air force is now using its full force to repeatedly bomb the Allied forces transported from the Algiers side to the front line. As a result, large fires have broken out everywhere on the narrow mountain roads leading to Taburba, hindering the advance of the British army.</p>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Havas News Agency)—German military sources recently stated that the Axis forces are continuing to advance near the city of Taburba in Tunisia. The British and American Allied forces are holding the mountainous area southwest of the city, but in order to implement an encirclement strategy against the German and Italian Allied forces, they have had to reduce their defense area. Although the British and American Allied forces have recently deployed a large number of tanks there for support, they will eventually have to retreat to avoid encirclement. Therefore, they have abandoned a large amount of land and lost a large number of military equipment and ammunition.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 8th (Havas News Agency)—According to an announcement released today by the British Middle East Command, the battle on the North African Libyan front is limited to skirmishes, and air battles are also more active than yesterday.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 8th (Domei News Agency)—According to news received here, the German army has begun an all-out counteroffensive on the Eastern Front in the last two or three days. On the St. Petersburg front, the German army bravely attacked Soviet positions in the Don River plains despite the snow, and the Soviet army is currently busy defending. Various strategic points in the northwest and eastern parts of St. Petersburg have been completely occupied by the German army. In the northern factory area of ​​St. Petersburg, the German army breached several temporary Soviet positions and expanded the occupied area. According to Moscow news, it was admitted on the 8th that the Soviet army's operations were greatly hindered due to bad weather. As for the German troops in Yerzevo, Kalinin, and Wilkieel in the west of Moscow, the counteroffensive was very fierce. Especially in the area between Yerzevo and Vyazma, the two armies launched a tank battle throughout the 7th to seize Samz, a strategic railway point. The Soviet army suffered a concentrated bombing by German dive bomber squadrons, and most of its combat power was lost, so it had to retreat to the northeast.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 9th (Domei News Agency)—According to a Washington dispatch, US Secretary of the Navy Knox announced yesterday that, according to aerial reconnaissance and other reports, the French fleet in Toulon, the Mediterranean base, scuttled itself last month. However, a quarter of them are still in Toulon Harbor and have not been damaged. At that time, 50 warships and one cargo ship were damaged and sunk. In addition, four French submarines, in the hands of the Degoulle faction, escaped from Toulon and are still floating in the water and appear to be undamaged. Fifteen French warships are still floating in the water and appear undamaged, including two light cruisers. The French battleships "Strasbourg," "Dunkerque," and "Provence" have been injured and stranded, but can still be repaired.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency)—According to a Washington dispatch, US Secretary of the Navy Knox met with a group of reporters on the 8th. Based on a public announcement from the US government, he stated that the damage to the French fleet in Toulon Harbor was less severe than initially reported. He said that one capital ship, one light cruiser, three large destroyers, three destroyers, two gunboats, four submarines, and five oil tankers of the French fleet were indeed seized by the German army. Knox also announced that the scuttled French fleet included one capital ship, five cruisers, fifteen large destroyers, eleven destroyers, one seaplane aircraft carrier, one submarine barrier laying ship, one transport ship, one old battleship, three submarines, and 51 ships in total. Two of the battleships may be salvaged and reused. Because when the above-mentioned 20-odd French fleet merged into the Axis fleet in the Mediterranean, the naval balance on both sides of the Mediterranean was lost, and the Allied rear communication lines had long become the target of the Axis air force and submarines.</p>

<h3 id="e19">The Inside Story of Mainland China Student Loans: Seemingly Doing Everything Possible to Protect Education, But in Reality, the Implementers' Measures Are Inappropriate <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>As early as February 5th of the 27th year [1938], the Ministry of Education of the Chongqing government promulgated the "Provisional Measures for Student Loans in Public Specialized Schools and Above in War Zones," stipulating that loans be divided into:</p>
<p>(A) Full amount: 8 or 10 yuan per month.</p>
<p>(B) Half amount: 4 or 5 yuan per month.</p>
<p>Subsequently, living expenses continued to rise, and revisions were made repeatedly. The current methods are:</p>
<p>(1) War zone student meal loans are divided into: Class A—granted to those whose original place of residence is occupied and whose economic resources are completely cut off, with a monthly loan based on 18 yuan, plus additional amounts.</p>
<p>(2) Self-funded student auxiliary loans are divided into:</p>
<p>Class A—granted to those from poor families whose original place of residence is not occupied, the loan amount is the same as Class B in item (1).</p>
<p>Class B—granted to those with more difficult economic circumstances, the loan amount is half of Class A.</p>
<p>The meal loan was initially a fixed amount. However, because rice prices rose at any time, the fixed amount was insufficient to maintain the students' nutrition. Therefore, it was changed to be calculated based on the local rice price, converting each person to two "shi dou" and one "shi sheng," plus oil, salt, vegetables, fuel, and kitchen worker expenses. Estimated based on Sichuan Province prices in July, the government's expense for a fully subsidized meal loan student is 90 to 100 yuan per month, about 1,300 yuan per year. Even if calculated based on war zone Class B or self-funded Class A, the government's burden is 70-80 yuan per person, 1,000 yuan per year. Considering only Class A and Class B loans, the annual cost is no less than 50 million yuan. In addition, there are special loans, spending money loans, uniform loans, etc., all established to help poor students in war zones.</p>
<p>The amount spent on student loans cannot be said to be small. On the surface, it seems to have done everything possible to protect education. However, this is not the case. Students in various universities are experiencing various dissatisfactions. Tracing the cause to its origin, it lies in the inappropriate measures of the implementers. Based on investigations, the general perception of inappropriateness can be summarized into seven points:</p>
<p>(1) After the war dragged on for a long time, students' economic abilities could not be simply divided by "occupied area" or "non-occupied area." There are often students whose families are in "non-occupied areas" but are economically very difficult, and there are also students whose families are in "occupied areas" but whose fathers and brothers already have another economic foundation in the mainland. If one cannot thoroughly understand the students' family backgrounds and insists on acting according to rigid regulations, unfairness is almost inevitable.</p>
<p>(2) Some schools stipulate that students who have remittances cannot receive loans. Although this is a kind of restriction method, it is prone to misunderstandings without detailed investigation. For example, if a student receives a remittance letter entrusted by a friend, the school authorities will cancel their loan qualification, which runs counter to the original intent of the legislation.</p>
<p>(3) There is also a regulation that those who have been disciplined will not receive loans. Although this contains the meaning of punishing evil and rewarding good, young people should be given an opportunity to rehabilitate themselves in educational principles.</p>
<p>(4) Students who apply for loans face numerous and overly cumbersome procedures. Official documents are repeatedly transferred, often taking several months, causing great distress to students who really need assistance.</p>
<p>(5) The loan management agency obstructs fairness in the review of students applying for loans, and there are inappropriate cases of selection, resulting in those who should receive it not receiving it, and those who should not receive it receiving it. There are also rumors that professors use loans to win over students, or that students use loans to take their lovers to the movies or eat in restaurants.</p>
<p>(6) The loan disbursement time is sometimes delayed for too long. There are even cases where loans for January and February are still being disbursed in April and May. If students rely entirely on loans for food, there is bound to be a risk of running out of food.</p>
<p>(7) In some places, the number of loan students is falsely reported to fraudulently obtain loans, or loans are deliberately suppressed and used for unethical acts such as investing in national bonds, which can be said to be a strange phenomenon in the pure and noble halls of learning.</p>
<p>There is originally no question about the loan system itself, but the implementation lacks the four key points of fairness, integrity, carefulness, and speed. Therefore, the malpractices are countless, and useful money is wasted in vain. If those who educate young people are like this, how can we blame the young people? Therefore, if university students cannot stabilize their lives, it will inevitably affect their studies. The decline in standards is also one of the factors.</p>

Being the first meeting since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, it undoubtedly holds significant meaning. In past conferences, the Ministers of Finance and Foreign Affairs usually attended. This year, the Prime Minister, the Minister of Greater East Asia Affairs, and the heads of the Army and Navy information departments will also participate, which is particularly noteworthy in the current situation.</p>
<p>With the development of the Greater East Asia War, the East Asian Economic Sphere has greatly expanded, including Annam, Thailand, Burma, and various parts of the South Seas. In the East Asia Economic Conference, representatives from these regions will soon be seen attending. However, this time, representatives from Manchuria, Central China, North China, Mengjiang, and Japan will still hold discussions.</p>
<p>The "Essentials of Economic Construction for Japan, China, and Manchukuo" announced by the Cabinet Intelligence Department in November of the 15th year of Showa [1940], and the "Essentials for the Establishment of National Land Planning" decided by the Cabinet Council in September of the same year, both designated the three countries of Japan, China, and Manchukuo as the center of the East Asian Economic Sphere, with the Southern regions also included in the plan. Whether from the perspective of the history of construction or the perspective of the main supply of resources from the Southern regions, the three countries of Japan, China, and Manchukuo should be the center of East Asian economic construction, and this principle remains unchanged even today. The purpose of the East Asia Economic Conference is to promote economic integration between Japan, China, Manchukuo, and other East Asian regions, and to strive to strengthen their comprehensive economic power. Therefore, the construction of the already expanded East Asian Economic Sphere should also be an important topic for discussion among the representatives of the three countries.</p>
<p>Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, countries around the world did not believe that Japan would submit to the demands of the United States in the negotiations, thinking that even if Japan rose up in resistance, it would inevitably be defeated by the powerful American military in an instant. However, Japan conquered the Southern regions in a short period and advanced from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean, creating an unshakable situation. However, they still refuse to give up the dream of the ultimate American victory and have begun to establish what they call a long-term strategy following this dream. The United States has now made a huge military buildup plan; Chongqing is still promulgating the National General Mobilization Law under the guise of independent resistance, and is starting to develop the Northwest, engaging in the construction of the Chongqing-India highway, in order to prolong its regime.</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War is a long-term war, and the China Incident must also be resolved after the completion of the Greater East Asia War. Japan is currently advancing resolutely toward the completion of the war with such determination.</p>
<p>Therefore, in this situation, the responsibility borne by the East Asian Economic Sphere is very significant. It is no longer enough to simply talk about construction, etc. It must directly share the important responsibility of one wing and increase its war power to complete the Greater East Asia War. This is the first major significance and responsibility borne by the East Asia Economic Conference after the start of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Have the current situations in Central China, North China, Manchuria, and Mengjiang cultivated the strength to fulfill this major responsibility? The conference should not simply end with discussions or friendly talks, but should truly plan well according to the demands of the profound situation. (Translated by Ding)</p>
<h3 id="e21">Hopes for the East Asia Economic Conference - Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, November 28th <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>The fourth East Asia Economic Conference will be held consecutively for three days from November 26th to 28th, with a large number of representatives from Japan, China, Manchukuo, and Mongolia attending. Its grand scale is not difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>The conference has contributed greatly to the economic construction of Japan, China, Manchukuo, and Mongolia. This is the first time it has been held since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, and its significance and responsibility feel even greater. Needless to say, the purpose of the conference is to promote economic cooperation; when the economic figures of the various regions gather together, they will sincerely discuss the best policies for the East Asian economy, clear up mutual opinions, and contribute to the construction of a new order in East Asia. However, at the same time, it is also an important goal to take this opportunity to give the economic figures from various regions a correct understanding of the actual situation of our country (Japan) in various aspects such as politics, economy, and culture.</p>
<p>Of course, these goals have not lost their importance at all today, when the China Incident has developed into the Greater East Asia War. Not only that, but under this Greater East Asia War, it is especially necessary to emphasize the understanding and economic cooperation of Japan, China, Manchukuo, and Mongolia, which have become the center of the new order in East Asia. Naturally, its content must be different from before. That is, since the start of the war with the United States and Britain, thanks to the magnificent achievements of the Imperial Army, the new order in East Asia has expanded to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and its scope of coverage has become very wide, both regionally and racially. As a result, the important issues of production, allocation, consumption, transportation, finance, and prices that have always been discussed between Japan, China, Manchukuo, and Mongolia must also be re-examined from this perspective. Also, how to invite the various regions that have come to participate in the sacred task of building a new order in East Asia into this conference is something that must be considered.</p>
<p>It is hoped that those attending this year's Economic Conference, in view of the important mission undertaken by the conference, should concentrate their sincere intentions on defeating the United States and Britain, so that there will be no regrets in the cooperation of both material and spiritual forces for the completion of the Greater East Asia War, and take the opportunity to renew their determination to defeat England and America.

<h3 id="e30">Entering the Second Year of the Greater East Asia War: Strengthening Determination to Win Victory; Army and Navy Information Ministers Encourage Japanese Residents <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Allied Press, local report: Shanghai's Japanese Navy Information Minister Colonel Kamata and Japanese Army Information Minister Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama stated at a gathering of Japanese residents last night that all Japanese people in Asia should strengthen their determination to win on the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War and dedicate themselves to the war in order to achieve victory in this great struggle. Colonel Kamata addressed the general assembly of Japanese residents at the International Theater, stating that the Greater East Asia War is not a war against aggressor countries, but a war to help the weak and suppress the strong. The result is that it has destroyed the Anglo-American bases of aggression in East Asia, as evidenced by Willkie's statement after his world tour that the British Empire no longer exists. The victories Japan has achieved in the land, sea, and air during the past five years of the China Incident are due to the belief of Japanese soldiers that they will win every battle. However, this war will extend for many years, so the Japanese people should increase their determination to win, as strong as steel. The plan for one year lies in New Year's Day, and the plan for the Greater East Asia War lies in December 8th. We have entered the second year of the war, and we must boost our spirits and strengthen our courage. Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama addressed the general assembly of Japanese residents at the Donghe Theater, emphasizing that the Japanese people must first prepare to cope with all kinds of difficulties before they can achieve final victory. He also said that the Greater East Asia War is a war to establish a just and benevolent world and to build the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, so the Japanese people should spare no sacrifice to win victory.</p>

The cotton cloth market was more stable, with 12-pound Dragon Head cotton cloth at 193 yuan based on bank orders, Color Ball at 193 yuan, Flying Fish at 192 yuan, and Yang He Trumpet Five Blessings being sold at the lowest debt price of 191 yuan to 1.5 yuan, with the market again in a state of flux.</p>
<p>Woolen fabrics have risen much more recently than before our newspaper was suspended. The market has been buoyed by rumors of favorable buying, and people's attitudes have changed. Financial institutions and wealthy dealers have been actively absorbing stocks, leading to extremely active wholesale trading in the market. However, because production at domestic factories has decreased rather than increased, and imported goods are increasingly sold out, there is a lack of circulating funds. Some are hoarding, while others are aggressively buying, causing prices to rise steadily. Yesterday, prices for riding breeches, paletot cloth, valencia cloth, Xuanwei cloth, white serge, ramie cloth, and other fabrics were even higher.</p>
<h3 id="e42">High Pig Iron Prices, Scarce Sales <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, various markets have been flourishing, and the hardware market has also gradually become bullish. However, sales of various products are actually sluggish, and much of the activity in the market is speculative, with actual sales being negligible. Pig iron is no exception. Although prices remain firm, sales are extremely scattered, and business is very quiet. Yesterday's market prices for pig iron were 5,000 yuan per ton for Indian Desert pig iron, 4,500 yuan per ton for steel mold pig iron, 3,200 yuan per ton for Shijinshan pig iron, and 2,700 yuan per ton for old pig iron.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Sesame Nails Difficult to Sell <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Trading in sesame nails ranging from 3 fen to 6 fen has been sluggish for a long time. Both wholesale and retail sales are slow. The main reason is that sales are difficult to achieve, so traders' morale is low. Although the stock of this product in Shanghai is not large, prices have remained weak. Yesterday's market prices were 1,400 yuan per case for 3 fen nails, 1,300 yuan per case for 4 fen nails, 1,200 yuan per case for 5 fen nails, and about 1,100 yuan per case for 6 fen nails. There is a shortage of 3 fen West nails, but sales are also lackluster, so prices are stagnant, at 1,500 yuan per case.</p>

<p>Walnuts Tight and Strong - Walnuts are tight and strong because of active demand in the city. Top-grade Hebei walnuts are quoted at 480 yuan, ordinary southern walnuts at 450 yuan, and top-quality Dongchang walnuts are quoted at over 720 yuan but have not been sold. Market sentiment is therefore tight.</p>
<p>Black Dates Rise in Price - According to news from the production area, black dates have risen by 10 yuan due to the shrinking exchange rate, and prices in Nanjing have also risen by 30 yuan. Southern goods are priced as high as 530 yuan, and secondary goods are priced at 400 yuan. Northern goods are scarce.</p>
<p>Dried Scallops Firm - Dried scallops are in limited supply, and the market has recently firmed. Medium-sized dried scallops are priced at 5,000 yuan, and new small-sized Xingguang dried scallops are priced at 5,100 yuan. Suppliers are unwilling to lower prices, and further price increases are expected.</p>
<p>Sweet Potatoes Hoarded - Since rice prices have risen and supplies are scarce, sweet potatoes have become the first choice for most families to supplement their diets. They have risen daily from 35 yuan and 40 yuan. Yesterday morning they were still at 65 yuan, but by noon they had risen to 75 yuan. If measured by weight, the price may be even higher.</p>
<p>Cigarettes Remain Firm - Because gold thread has risen sharply, people are holding on tightly and unwilling to sell. British and American cigarettes continue to rise, while Japanese and domestic cigarettes are stabilizing. British American Tobacco's Big British brand is at 9,300 yuan, Old Knife brand at 8,400 yuan, Pinnacle at 8,000 yuan, Fairy at 6,600 yuan, and Five Flowers at 7,400 yuan. Japanese cigarettes such as Golden Gun are at 3,050 yuan, Golden Mansion at 3,500 yuan, Red Rose at 2,750 yuan, Quanlu at 3,150 yuan, Compass at 2,300 yuan, and Double Axe at 3,800 yuan. Domestic cigarettes such as Beautiful Spleen are at 6,100 yuan, Golden Mouse at 4,000 yuan, White Gold Dragon at 3,950 yuan, and Golden Dragon at 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Daily Necessities Expensive - The rising trend is alarming, and the selling prices of various goods have reached their highest levels. Due to the depletion of inventories, and stimulated by the recent rise in the prices of various goods, most merchants are becoming increasingly reluctant to sell and are only buying. For example, Guben soap has risen to 530 yuan per case, Scissors soap to 500 yuan, Huangxiangmao to 410 yuan, and Baixiangmao soap to 480 yuan, a significant increase of 30 to 40 yuan compared to the previous day. Phoenix brand matches are at 3,250 yuan, Beautiful brand at 3,400 yuan, Golden Tripod brand at 2,900 yuan, and miscellaneous brands at 2,500 yuan, also up 300 yuan. Price's candles are at 380 yuan, continuing to rise by 10 yuan.</p>
<p>Grains Rise Daily - Yesterday's grain market saw active trading, but because the supply was still limited, prices rose daily. Broad beans opened 30 yuan higher than before, and bean cakes also rose by 2 to 3 yuan. 60 bags of Chongming New Sand red beans were sold, with prices ranging from 310 yuan to 320 yuan. 60 bags of old red beans were priced at 225 yuan. 50 bags of Wujiang selected green beans were priced at 295 yuan. 140 bags of Minhang green broad beans were priced at 250 yuan. 20 bags of Tianjin red beans were priced at 280 yuan. Three trucks of Mingguang red sorghum were priced from 195 yuan to 200 yuan. Three trucks of Fat Brand cake were priced from 79.5 yuan to 78.5 yuan. Five trucks of Changji cake were priced at 77.5 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e45">The Greater East Asia War Over the Past Year (3) <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>(12) Battles in the South Pacific</p>
<p>Thus, the war progressed further, advancing towards securing Japanese-occupied territories and eliminating any possibility of Anglo-American counterattacks in the future.</p>
<p>First, in January, was the invasion of the Bismarck Archipelago. On January 23rd, landings were made on New Britain Island, and simultaneously on New Ireland Island. On the 26th, the general offensive on New Britain Island began, and soon after, the surrounding islands were completely occupied. In particular, the occupation of Rabaul and Kavieng, two important locations, made Japan's strategic position in the South Pacific even more advantageous, especially in successfully cutting off the connection between the United States and Australia to the greatest extent. On the one hand, the offensive against Timor Island west of New Guinea also progressed, increasing the effectiveness of the Japanese encirclement of New Guinea. On February 20th, the landing on Timor Island was completed. Transportation between the Dutch East Indies and Australia was now under Japanese control.</p>
<p>The Japanese army occupied the Bismarck Archipelago in the east and advanced into Timor Island in the west, forming a pincer attack on New Guinea. Subsequently, on March 8th, the Japanese army landed in New Guinea.</p>
<p>On March 31st, the Japanese army began the conquest of the Moluccas Islands and northwestern New Guinea. By April 19th, all key points in western New Guinea were completely occupied. After consolidating the west, they advanced from north to south, pressing towards eastern New Guinea.</p>
<p>When the Greater East Asia War developed to its fifth month, the area from the Solomon Islands in the east to New Britain in the west was occupied by the Japanese army. On April 19th, the pacification of western New Guinea was completed. As a result, Anglo-American forces in the southwestern Pacific were almost completely driven out, and Australia began to feel a significant threat. In particular, the Japanese occupation of Sumatra, Java, Timor, New Guinea, New Britain, and other islands, a continuous area of four thousand miles, formed an irresistible threat to Australia, and the American southward strategy in the Pacific was also destroyed.</p>
<p>(13) Control of the Indian Ocean</p>
<p>After Singapore and Sumatra were captured by the Japanese army, the Indian Ocean became the arena for the Japanese navy and air force.</p>
<p>First was the attack on Christmas Island, located two hundred and twenty miles south of the Sunda Strait. Since the Japanese army blocked the Strait of Malacca, the island had become the center of transportation between India and Australia. On March 1st, Japan began air raids, destroying Flying Fish Cove, the island's only harbor, and the facilities of the Anglo-American joint fleet. The Japanese navy began attacking the island on March 7th, and the Japanese army completely occupied it on the 31st, cutting off communications between India and Australia.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Japanese army began attacking the Andaman Islands, a key area in the southwestern Pacific, on March 17th. This was a communication center between Singapore and India, equidistant from Madras, Calcutta, and Colombo, and could be said to be a shield for India's national defense. On the 24th, they attacked Port Blair and the Andaman Islands. As a result, the largest strategic point in the eastern Indian Ocean fell into the hands of the Japanese army, and the east coast of mainland India and Ceylon were exposed to the threat of Japanese artillery fire.</p>
<p>Finally, attacks on the Indian mainland also began. On April 5th, Japanese naval forces began attacking Colombo, the capital of Ceylon, the largest British military base in the Indian Ocean, destroying all British warships, ships, and air power. On the 6th, the Japanese vanguard approached the Indian mainland, carrying out air raids on Cocanada, a key location in northern Madras State, and Chicacole. From then on, air raids on India were almost continuous. Colombo and Trincomalee, two military ports, were the easternmost British military strongholds after the fall of Singapore, serving as the front line for defending their treasure trove, India. The vast waters of Bengal, from Burma through Calcutta to Ceylon, were all under their control. After these two locations were subjected to Japanese bombing, the Indo-British military authorities could not help but panic. Now, transportation between India and Australia was almost completely cut off, and communication between India and the United States was in a critical situation; the position of the Union of South Africa also began to attract attention. From then on, the Greater East Asia War entered a period of direct involvement with the wars in Europe and Africa.</p>
<p>(14) Attacks on the American Mainland</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War contained the nature of a world war, and therefore, from the very beginning of the war, it was not limited to defense in the Pacific, but prepared for attacks on the American mainland. At 9:30 a.m. on December 8th, American radio reported that an American transport fleet sailing about 1,300 nautical miles west of San Francisco was attacked by submarines, and two of them sank. From this, it can be seen that maritime traffic along the American Pacific coast had long been threatened by Japanese submarines. On December 11th, the American naval authorities reported that Japanese submarines were operating on the American Pacific coast, and two American oil tankers were attacked. By December 30th, Japanese submarines were even appearing near the American coast, carrying out surprise attacks on Port Orford and Cove, shocking the American navy.</p>
<p>On February 25th, the Japanese headquarters announced that Japanese submarines had begun shelling American military facilities along the coast of California on the night of the 24th, achieving significant results. The American mainland began to suffer attacks, which was a historically significant event. Moreover, the political impact on the psychology of the American people was not to be ignored. President Roosevelt, in a conversation with reporters on the 25th, frankly admitted that the Japanese submarine shelling of the American mainland was "an example of excellent political strategy."</p>
<p>(15) The Miserable Defeat of Anglo-American Naval Counterattacks</p>
<p>When Anglo-Dutch-American forces suffered a disastrous collapse in the southwestern Pacific, it immediately aroused criticism from the people in Britain and America. To this end, the Anglo-American military authorities launched a "counterattack" against Japan.</p>
<p>For example, on May 6th, Japanese naval units operating in the New Guinea area discovered a powerful Anglo-American joint fleet in the Coral Sea southeast of the island and began counterattacking it on the 7th. According to the announcement of the Japanese headquarters, "Anglo-America attempted to stir up trouble in the South Pacific between Hawaii, Australia, and New Guinea, so it dispatched two of America's most elite aircraft carriers, along with many Anglo-American battleships and destroyers, establishing a powerful joint fleet to advance towards the Japanese line in the Coral Sea, but after a fierce Japanese counterattack, most of the enemy ships were destroyed."</p>
<p>However, Anglo-American propaganda about the counterattack continued. In order to completely eliminate any possibility of threatening the Japanese mainland, the Japanese side launched an offensive on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Line of the Third War Zone from March 19th, destroying the airfields and all facilities in Yushan, Lishui, and other places used by Anglo-America to threaten Japan, thoroughly eliminating the possibility of air raids on Japan.</p>
<p>(16) Operations in the Eastern Pacific</p>
<p>After all possibilities of threatening the Japanese mainland from the west and south were destroyed by the Japanese side, they began to eliminate possible threats from the northeast. Japanese naval air units began attacking the Aleutian Islands on June 4th. On the 7th, Japanese army units closely cooperated with the navy to attack Kiska Island, a military base in the Aleutian Islands.</p>
<p>After the American offensive routes in the central and southern Pacific were destroyed, they prepared to use Alaska and the Aleutian Islands as bases to attack the Japanese mainland, as a northern offensive route. However, military operations in that area could not be carried out in winter, and there was only the possibility of an offensive in summer, so Japan preempted the enemy by cooperating with the army to conquer Attu and Kiska Islands, instead creating a threat to the American mainland. On June 20th, Japanese submarines shelled Estevan Point near Canada, giving the Canadian people a great shock.</p>
<p>From then on, not only had the southwestern Pacific become a Japanese sea, but the eastern Pacific had also become the area of activity for the Japanese navy and air force.</p>
<p>(17) From the Solomon Sea Battle to the Advance into the Atlantic</p>
<p>On August 7th, Japanese naval air units discovered an Anglo-American joint fleet convoy in the Solomon Islands area. On the 8th, the Japanese navy dealt them a devastating blow. On August 14th, the Japanese headquarters announced that this battle had yielded unparalleled results in world history. The First Battle of the Solomon Sea thus ended in an absolute Japanese victory.</p>
<p>However, the Second Battle of the Solomon Sea followed. After the defeat in the first battle, the United States, in order to reverse the decline and boost morale, dispatched reinforcement fleets, advancing towards the waters east of the Solomon Islands on August 24th, but was immediately discovered by the Japanese side, which immediately launched air units to attack them urgently, inflicting heavy blows.</p>
<p>After the Second Battle of the Solomon Sea, Japan further seized the initiative and carried out the first air raid on the American mainland. On September 9th, Japanese seaplanes appeared off the southwestern coast of Oregon on the American Pacific coast, dropping incendiary bombs, causing a large fire, which shocked and disturbed the American people. Later, in late May, the Japanese navy even operated in the Atlantic Ocean, and thus the wars in Asia and Europe had already begun direct cooperation.</p>
<p>From the Solomon Sea Battle to the advance into the Atlantic, the historical development of the Greater East Asia War was demonstrated.</p>
<p>(18) The Third Battle of the Solomon Sea</p>
<p>Although the United States was repeatedly defeated, it did not completely abandon its ambition to counterattack. Especially the Solomon Islands – it was not only a shield for Australia but also an outpost for the United States; it was also the most important transportation center between Hawaii and Australia. As long as the United States could control the Solomon Islands, it could attempt to revive its forces in the southwestern Pacific. Conversely, if the Solomon Islands were completely controlled by the Japanese army, then not only would Australia be completely isolated, but Hawaii would also lose its value, and the direct threat to the United States itself would also greatly increase. It was precisely for this reason that the United States spared no effort, again and again, to collect its remaining forces in the southwestern Pacific, increase its new naval and air forces, and carry out a fierce counterattack in this area. From late October, especially in early November, it concentrated all its forces to pounce on the Japanese army, and fierce battles continued incessantly. In addition to constantly inflicting blows on the enemy, the Japanese army began active operations from the 13th, fiercely attacking Guadalcanal.</p>
<p>From the First Battle of the Solomon Sea on August 7th to November 14th, the results of the three Battles of the Solomon Sea show the ferocity of the three major battles in the South Pacific and how Japan maintained its dominant position in the Pacific with absolute superiority.</p>
<p>Enemy Losses:</p>
<p>Aircraft: 206 self-destroyed and missing, 31 severely damaged.</p>
<p>(Based on the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun of November 19th)</p>
<p>After the Third Battle of the Solomon Sea, the United States was clearly dealt a major blow, and doubts about its ability to counterattack had begun to arise among the Allied nations. At the same time, the result of this second front in the Pacific, proposed by the Chongqing regime and implemented by the United States, was such that political turmoil naturally occurred within the Chongqing regime.</p>
<p>The Prospects of the War</p>
<p>Now, as the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War approaches and the situation in the Pacific has undergone fundamental changes compared to a year ago, it is very meaningful for us to observe the prospects of this war, and it can be said that it is necessary for the people of every Asian country to recognize it.</p>
<p>First of all, looking back at the war over the past year, where did the main reasons for victory or defeat lie? On the Japanese side, we can cite the following: First, political reform, mainly the realization of a unified national political system, so that all political forces in the country were directed towards a single goal—to win the Greater East Asia War. In particular, in terms of manpower, no Japanese person could be outside the war, no Japanese person could fail to share the responsibilities assigned by the war, and no Japanese person failed to provide their strength twofold under the government's command to serve the Greater East Asia War. Second, economic concentration, which was first reflected in the early completion of the national general mobilization plan, and in the fact that all national materials and financial resources were fully supplied to the government in accordance with the government's mobilization plan, so that the government could calmly control these national materials and financial resources in order to win the war. Everything was fully prepared, without empty words of propaganda.</p>
<p>Secondly, what about Britain, America, and their allies? From a political point of view, Britain and America themselves had irreconcilable contradictions. Britain's internal political contradictions, the struggle between the left and right wings, the anti-Churchill movement, and the activities of pro-Soviet factions, all revealed the ugly state of an aging empire in the process of decay, with "hundreds of holes." It was precisely because of this ugly state that national policies were chaotic, and national strength was dispersed. Not only did the people of the colonies begin to seek liberation, but also the people of the country could not help but be indignant at the incompetence of the government. The situation in the United States was not much better than that of Britain. At home, all anti-war factions were active, and there was even a faction that openly opposed Roosevelt's pro-Soviet war effort. Therefore, although the United States had the world's number one industrial production capacity, the actual amount that could be used to support this war could not but be greatly discounted. As for the impossibility of gathering the strength of the people, it goes without saying.</p>
<p>In terms of foreign policy and ethnic policy, Britain and America were even more trapped in unprecedented failure. For example, Britain and America did not have sincerity towards the Soviet Union. The "opening of a second front in Europe," which had been touted for more than a year, was never launched. And some people in Britain and America still believed that cooperating with the Soviet Union would only increase the burden on Britain and America and leave future troubles. As for ethnic policy, although Britain and America had drafted the so-called "Atlantic Charter" a year ago by Roosevelt and Churchill, in their actual measures in dealing with the Indian nationalist movement, they had already confessed that it was just a deceptive thing.</p>
<p>When we compare the situation of both sides in this Greater East Asia War, isn't the outcome of the war already very obvious? However, we cannot overestimate the enemy's strength too much. We should recognize that Britain has always avoided major battles in this war. It has retreated shamelessly all the way... Therefore, it has also preserved a part of its naval power. As for the United States, it is the largest industrial country in modern times. Although it also has hundreds of holes internally, it is also a fact that its country has not suffered fatal blows in the past few years. Therefore, the countries within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere should face these realities, face these realities squarely, correctly recognize their own position and mission, and redouble their efforts to welcome the arrival of the new era. Now is not the time to celebrate, now is the time for us to endure and welcome greater suffering! Everyone, get tense, everyone, unite! Strive and struggle! (The End)</p>
