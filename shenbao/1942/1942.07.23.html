<p>據昨天英文泰晤士報的報導，上月二十九日由本市開出的撒僑輪「康脫凡第」號，和另一艘由日本開出的「淺間丸」，就要於今天開抵葡屬東非莫三鼻給海峽的羅倫哥馬格斯了，</p>
<p>「康脫凡第輪上的乘客，計有三百三十六人，以國籍分之，美國五四九人，加拿大二〇人，墨西哥一四人，巴西一三人，英國七人，以職業分之，有外交官，有敎士，有商人，有單純的僑民，其中以外交人員爲最多，「康脫凡第」號離滬之日，風蕭蕭，雨凄凄，也可以用以形容他們的蓮命吧，然而他們能够踏七返屬的旅程，也總是不幸中幸運了。</p>
<p>若使沒有這次交換戰鬥國僑民之事，羅倫哥馬格斯道一地名，對於般的讀者恐怕是十分生疏的吧，戰鬥國所以選擇這個地方爲交換彼此僑民之地，並非偶然的，因爲此地是中立國葡萄牙屬地莫三鼻給的一個港口，雖然平時覺得偏僻一點，但在今日的戰時地現上，牠還是英美日間的一個中心，莫三鼻給的原文爲Mozam　bique，俗稱爲葡囑東非，這値地方是根據一八九年六月英葡協定而劃定了他的境界的，到了上次大戰結束以後，列强父將一部德屬東非合併於葡屬東非以內，並承認葡萄牙在此具有宗主的權益，葡屬東非的總面積計有二九七，六五七方里，其中分爲二部，一者爲葡國的直接統治地（二四五，七匕六　里），一者爲地方政府的統治地，直接統治地分爲七區，即Inh　ambque，Quelimane，Tete，Mozambique，Cabo　Delgade，Nyassa等六個，另外還有一個，即此文叙述的羅倫哥馬格斯Lourence　Maraues，</p>
<p>羅倫哥馬格新是地區的名稱，同時又是港口的名稱，牠是葡屬東非的要港，同時又是葡屬東非的首府—政府所在地，就港口而言，葡屬東非的許多出產，如糖，棉花，蔴，麥，及礦產物等都是經此出口，而運到世界各地六，同時樣樣色色的外來品，如衣料，日用品，機械等，也經此輸入於葡屬東非的各個角落，據戰　的調查，牠每年的輸出約違葡幣五千萬元，而輪入亦有五千五百萬元之多，因爲這裹是葡屬非洲輸出入的孔道，所以船隻進出亦頗繁盛，據一九三九年的統計，入港船隻有一千一百二十艘，達五，七八六，三二四噸，出港的有一千一百二十七艘，達五，八〇〇，三〇四噸，戰爭以後，各國船隻多停舶於此，因以碼頭附近船艦陳的條件，而是葡萄牙政府的政策不想以軍備來維持牠在這裏的地位，自然更不敢想以此為根據地逐漸伸張牠的勢力。因此之故，葡國在全部葡屬東非的兵力，包含長官在內，不過二千八百人。</p>
<p>有人說羅倫哥馬格斯是個和平的港口，我想這也許是實列，各色各樣的國旗飄揚江岸，你不干我，我不干你。十足呈現着中立國家的色彩。</p>
<p>葡屬東非的政府—指葡國政府的直接統治地，包含兩個機關，一是立法院，一是行政院，立法院是由當地各階層各社會中所推舉出來的代表組織的，而行政院與各區總督，例是由於葡國政府的任命，境內人口，据一九三〇年的調查，為三，九九五，八三一人，（內有三五，五七〇爲歐洲人，）其中以羅倫哥馬格斯爲最多，數違四二，七七九人，（一九三一年統計），羅備哥馬格斯的敎育，並不算高，但在偏僻的東非，倒算比較的發達，我們借用The　tate　man’s　Year　Book調查的數字，這裏有二十八所小學和八所高導小學，此外還有一個中央高級學校和七個專門性質的學完。</p>
<p>羅倫哥馬格斯是僩要港，但牠沒有亞力山人那樣的軍事氣味，返並非羅港不配得做一個軍港——牠具有優良的軍港吧，至少在今日還可這樣說的，否則，戰鬥國也不會選擇這個地方爲交換僑民的地方啊，各國僑民在此登陸以後，將分別踏上返歸祖國的途上，我們在遙遠的東方，祝他們早些到達這塊地方，再早些換上另一船隻，投入祖國的懷抱。</p>

<p>上舊書店淘舊書，這在體而的人看來似乎是寒廢的行徑。因爲書之爲物，險了宋元精槃，性質近終　董，可　存而不論外，其餘是新的比舊的好。一本書旣　「售」的程，外形至少不大漂亮，內容　頗可懷疑　在　洋出版　發達的國家，一本書一年一版以至幾版幾十版、乃是極尋常之事，一般著作家態度，又是那麽認眞，每一次再版總得　內容修正下，要是都像梁啟超一樣今日之我，同昨日之我宜戰，不待幾年，同一著作，同一著作人，內容會改得全然不同、可是舊書店仍舊有它獨特的支撐點：一則，舊售價比較便宜；二則，有類一經絕版的書，舍此更無法他求。</p>

<p>一度衰落</p>
<p>滬戰旣起，舊書市塲大部在戰區，當然沒有立足的餘地，於是遷移的遷移，收歇的收歇。其中一部份原楚店的，也緊縮爲攤。曾碰到一位舊書攤主，他原先在橫浜橋開設舊責店的，跟我狠熟，如今變了　着幾十本破售的書，盤坐在地上，像是白頭宮女，顯出不勝滄桑的樣子。他嘮叨地訴說着：從前生意怎樣好做，資本厚，利潤大，大夾百科全書，一年中也得經手十多　。</p>

<p>中興之局</p>
<p>最近一二年來，因了白報紙價格的激漲，與印刷條件的異常困難，許多大書店版的書，售價增上十倍，　除了敎利書之外，一般重要的參攷書”文藝書，都不再　印，　完就算數。這樣一來，出了錢買不到新書和許多經濟困難買不起新書的讀者，便不得不問津於舊書店，雖然目前舊書的價格，未必見得如何便宜，但較之新書總要上算得多了。</p>
<p>新闢市塲</p>
<p>由於上述幾種原因，舊書店一時頗有由衰落轉變到中興的趨勞。原有四馬路一區特別繁榮不必說，新闢的市塲，當推愛文義路卡德路一帶，那裏在過去，原也設着三四爿舊書店，不過情况冷落簫條，決非環龍橋中華路熱鬧情况所可比擬。現在物以類聚，以前開設虹口南市的，一窩風遷移過來，又因該區週繞學校櫛比，一班學生無疑是舊書店的好主顧，因此，一片繁榮景明，形成和四馬路區對壘之局，此外，愛多亞路的和辣斐德路（馬浪路口左右一帶）市塲，也是戰後新與的，可惜攤多店少，和當年蓬來路情形彷彿。</p>
<p>淘金心理</p>
<p>店的動機，不單單是貧　宜點。春秋佳日，閑眉無事，在店內攤畔隨便翻翻舊　，實什也是一種樂趣，要是偶然以極便宜的價格，買到幾本在外間訪求　狠久而尙未見到的書，那種愉　高興，直是非日語所能形容。十年前，記者有一癖好，喜歡集藏雜誌蓑古今名書及攝影的揰圖，引朋友翁六雄君爲同志，工作之暇，老是一搭一擋躦在南市舊書店裏，我們的切口叫「淘金去」，在許多零亂的書堆出，細心地挑剔，懷着洶沙得金般熱烈心理，往往滿戰而歸。如是者五六年，記者一人約摸集得三千多幀，翁君所得還不止此，我們沒有化狠多的錢，興趣却楚極濃郁的。後來寄放在南市朋友家裏，「八一三」戰役，竟成灰燼，至今想起，猶覺心痛。</p>
<p>瞻望前途</p>
<p>據記者觀察，在目前非常環境之下，舊書店此後祇有一天天的興旺下去，主要的原因，自然是爲了出版業不景氣和新書售價太高，使讀者不得不降格以求；另一方面，戰爭浩刦，把數量極多的私人藏書或公家藏書，像廢紙般流通到市塲上來，這是促進舊書店繁榮的大動力。</p>
<p>一幕奇蹟</p>
<p>有一位朋友化兩塊錢買得李長吉集四冊，自己不在意，給版本家一看，說是宋刻，從此驚動了舊書店伙計，此去彼來，踞住不放，結果，朋友以六千元脫手，隔了幾天，原價兩圓的李長吉集已珍藏於南潯某富翁書齋中，所化代價　說是二萬二千元。</p>

<p>— 伍岱</p>
<p>一個人如果想在人生中得到成功，他必須相信自己。相信自己的能力。相信自己的工作。</p>
<p>不論你是兵士，簿記員，牧師或畫家；不論你是機械匠，是工人，是農夫或作家，除非你相信你對世界的需要能有所貢獻，能使人類更幸福，能使社會更進步，你是一定要失敗無疑的。</p>
<p>你會失敗，因為你對於自己的工作缺少信念。</p>
<p>有一家大公司的經理，對於前來應徴推銷員的，一槪</p>
<p>接見，然後再予僱用。他說：「我一定要先曉得我們的推銷員對於我們的貨色有着了解，相信我們的貨色的價值，然後他才能成功一個好的貨物推銷者。」</p>
<p>我們對於我們自己和我們的工作，也要有同樣的感覺，因為我們對世界所貢獻的，就是我們自己和工作的一部份。</p>
<p>我們有信心，然後才能使與我們接觸的人也有信心。</p>
<p>我們有勇氣，然後才能鼓起別人的勇氣。</p>
<p>我們相信，相信自己，相信人類，相信社會的進步，才能引起別人同樣的信念。</p>
<p>我們有天賦影響別人的力量，我們有利用這種力量來帮助別人的義務。</p>

<h3 id="c70">電氣隱身砲 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— 磨進</p>
<p>聽人家說起了大砲，或在紙上看到大砲的字眼，我人的耳膜裏，便會隨着感覺到一種轟轟隆隆巨大可怕的砲聲。這令人喪膽洛魄的百響，是因為在開砲的時候利用了炸藥作用而把砲彈射出去的當兒，所發生的爆炸聲。「轟轟隆隆」雖可使敵兵心顫氣餒，然因此使敵方根據砲聲及開砲時所發生的濃烈烟火而窺測了軍隊的據點，加以還擊，這是大砲唯一的缺點了。</p>
<p>最近發明家設計了一種特異的大砲，彌補了上述的缺點，那就是開砲的時候，是利用了電力的作用將砲彈迅速的射出，沒有饗聲，沒有姻火，這砲的最大特色是使對方無從知道砲彈的來處，只見落地開花，來去無踪，不知道砲兵藏身所在，茫茫戰塲，大有草木皆兵之感，那可眞使人防不勝防了。</p>
<p>這種　氣砲的構造，相當於一架電氣馬達，砲彈的前半部裝置着一個「鼠籠式電樞」，砲身的內壁則設有「螺旋捲綫」開砲的時價，把砲彈裝進砲身內，只要一通電流，砲彈就因雷磁感應的作用，急速旋轉，而以極高的速度被推離砲口，到達目的地後，砲彈內部的作藥因「時間裝置」的控制而猛烈爆炸，和普通的砲彈一樣。</p>
<p>開大砲而可以無聲無烟，正好像人們夢想着有了隱身術便可以手持白刃肆意妄為的一般痛快，道電氣砲就好像替普通大砲披上了隱身砲衣，在暗處殺人，可以被叫做「隱身砲」了。</p>

<p>— 唐牧</p>
<p>有一個知己朋友，剛大學畢業不久，就息時症死了。此君年　英俊，心懷大志，父是父母老年所得的獨生子，不幸客死他鄕。我以好友的資格，先為他辦理人醫院的手續，後米又為他辦理安葬的事宜。他在故鄉的父母、突接愛子夭逝的噩耗，當然悲痛逾恒。我於事後寫一封信去報吿他們的兒子臨終的情形，並加以弔唁和安慰。最後我講了一個故事給他們聽。</p>
<p>我在信上說：「我實在找不出甚麼話可以安慰你們。不過我記得一個西方的故事，願一次，有幾個富有冒險性的歐洲靑年，結隊到亞爾卑斯山上去爬山。不料到了山上，有一位靑年從冰川上失足跌下深谷中去，轉瞬被雪所掩埋伏了。其中有一個習科學的同伴，就計算到了多少年以後的某月某日，當山上的冰雪融化了的時候，這屍體行將重新出現。當日期來臨的時候，這一隊爬山的同伴，又結隊到同一個地點去，要看那預言是否準確。到那天，那靑年的屍體果然出現了，栩栩如生，還是和從前一樣年靑，而返顧目已，大家却都已經是老頭子了，大家感喟無窮。令郞的壯志未酬身先死，固然是一件憾事，但是我們活着的朋友，大家有一天都要褻老下去，而令郞在大家心目的印象，却將永遠年靑，像那個失足墮入深谷中的靑年一樣。」　我不知道這個簡單的故事，對於這兩位老人家，可能算是一種小的安慰。但是，這故事對於我個人，却始終有一種美妙的吸引力。</p>

<p>— 洪道</p>
<p>（三）由「無所不知」到　「完全不知」</p>
<p>據說幾年前國內某大學裏曾經流行過這麽幾句關於大學生的話：「大一學生無所不知，大二學生知道一些，大三學生談情說愛，大四學生完全不知。J（Freshmen　Know　everything，　Sophomores　Know　something　Juniors　are　love-makers，　and　Seniors　Know　nothing．）在相當限度之內，這幾句話頗足以顯示靑年在四年大學中心理變遷的過程。</p>
<p>大一學生為甚麼是「無所不知」的呢？原來高中畢業牛初入大學，往往夜郞自大，目空一切。他們覺得畢業高中，差不多甚麽都知道了，現在踏進最高學府之門，更覺神氣無比，自命不凡。他們不曉得世間的學問是無限量的，知識的寳藏是無窮盡的。他們小曉得他們所得到的學識，只不過是滄海之一粟。他們對於大學的課程還沒有十分瞭解，對大學敎育的價值還沒有給予適當的估量。他們把敎授們的敎誨當做耳邊風，不能用謙虛的　懷去接受古今中外先知先覺聖賢鴻哲的學識經騐。他們須經過一番的廠迪，才能够感覺到自己的愚昧無知。</p>
<p>大學生已受過相當的敎訓，知道大一時代自以為「無所不知」，乃是極端幼稚可笑的錯誤觀念。可是他們還有點自負，還覺得目己「知道一些」。他們要等到循循善誘的敎授加以開導，把學問的淵海指給他們看，他們才會恍然大悟，知道自己並不十分偉大。到這時候，他們才肯低下頭來，虛心受敎。</p>
<p>到大學三年級時，他們覺得大學的程途已經走了一半，距畢業之期不遠，大學生的資格已經頗老。他們覺得要講戀愛，此其時矣。在這種思念的支配下，他們開始努力追求異性，談情說愛成為他們最重要的「課外活動」。在這個時期中，他們飄浮在粉粉色的幻夢裹，把學業暫時丟在腦　了。</p>
<p>大學四年級生思想漸漸成熟，對於知識領域之廣大已有比較正確的認識。他們學習越多，越感到自己學識的淺薄。「學然後知不足」，眞是一點不錯。同時他們因為畢業期近，開始想到出路問題。他們與社會接　較多，才發覺自己所得的學識實在不足以應付職業上的需要。他們到這時候才後悔在過去的歲月中沒有專心致志於學業，到這時候才知道四年大學只給他們一點基本的專門知識，求學的方法，和技能上初步的訓練。至於想在社會上應付一切，希望於職業方　勝任愉快，還得經過一番修養的苦功夫，尙有待於自己再接再厲的努力。在這種覺司下，他們自然會感到「完全不知」的徬徨了。事實上他們並不是「完全不知」的，知道自己「無知」，才是眞正知識的開始。因為一個人知道自己知識淺薄，才能夠虛懷若谷，無時或見的去追求高深的學問。由「無所不知」到「完全不知」可說是大學生由四年大學敎育中所得到的一個重要的敎訓。（全篇完）</p>

<p>吿訴你，昨夜里，我織着夢。心是憂鬱的，夢也成了憂鬱的了。</p>
<p>不是說，我歡喜夢，而，夢是時常侵蝕了我的。往常，我織過各種不同的夢，有快樂的時候，我享受了；但有憂鬱的時候，我被麼折着，夢中的程度更超過了現實。</p>
<p>於是，我更多了憂　。你呢？我們不是都各自沉浸在哀愁的大海中嗎？一種多麽難耐的重負。</p>
<p>如何解去我們打結的心？如果世界有一偭末日，那末毀滅就會給一個結束。</p>
<p>你會說，那樣太殘酷了，難道就是如此了結嗎？</p>
<p>這無論如何是不甘心的。我們曾越過森林和山谷，也曾淹沒在生命之海的波浪下面。你說那是一個多麽勞苦而疲倦的旅程。也有　快樂的時候，但憂愁，更隨着疲倦而累積了。</p>
<p>我們在黑暗之中作渺茫的摸索。經慣了黑暗再瞧光亮的時候是如何的刺目而欣喜；但從光亮中落入黑暗，眼睛模糊了。我不能看淸痛苦表達於你的面目，你也不能吧。——哦，憂鬱的夢！</p>
<p>即使是長夜也有盡了的時候，憂鬱的夢，不會經久吧！</p>

<p>果然葉二太太，在西邊屋子裹開門過來，一路開門，一路喚道：「維城，誰在怪聲怪氣的叫喚？咦！維城屋子裏沒燈，睡了嗎？不早了，是該睡了。」接着又聽兒葉二太太關了門去就寢。維城只求他叔母不明白自己在叫喚，全不顧到這也算是欺騙了他的叔母。</p>
<p>翠珍，不能不說是一個有心人，她在雙梅書屋裹，目覩了維城驚呼和變色，在想着這事情有些不尋常·雖然她去吿訴葉二太太，雖然維城在葉二太太面前掩飾過，她還是不能消釋她的疑慮。到第二天，葉二太太吿訴翠珍說：　「昨天晚上怪得很，我睡夢裹聽到維城大喊聲，開了門出來看，維城屋子裹的燈火是熄了。今天問維城，他又說沒有叫喚過。問喜鵲何媽阿興，他們也都說聽見有人大喊、聲。一翠珍道：「我也聽到的，不過住在後邊，聽不眞切。」翠珍說過了，越發添了疑慮，她處處地方在留心察看維城的舉動。</p>
<p>維城和翠珍，形成了鬥智，翠珍處處在留心，維城却處處在防備。假使碰到翠珍　他們前後左右，他使極力裝做鎭　，你們笑他也跟着一笑。只有到了目己寢室裏，到了雙梅書屋裹父母遺像面前，他就不是悲，便是憤，老是把拳頭揑得緊緊的，常常把指中痕搯人掌心裹，搯得很深很深，回過頭來看沒人，就長長的噓了一口氣。有一天，他又噓了一口氣，翠珍從外邊走進來道：「城弟，你別瞞我了。你這幾天，笑不是自然的笑，背了人，老是長噓短嘆。你吿訴我吧，你有什麽吿訴不得一伯母的，也告訴我。我難然是一個女人，走路也走得，力氣也比了阿興不差甚麼，你吿訴我，我想跟你分一些憂愁。」維城見了翠珍，笑道：「翠珍姊，你又要無事忙了，前回說我少吃了飯，鬧的家裹人都不安。這回又猜我有了心事，其實我還是沒有什麽。翠珍姊，謝謝你的好意，可是你這好意，是白費心了。」翠珍道：「不！你一定有着心事，不然，斷沒有個少年人天天會嘆氣的。」（一三五）</p>

<p>Hankou, 12th (Domei News Agency dispatch) – Japanese forces in Central China, braving the intense heat, launched a fierce attack on the 143rd Division and 119th Division north of Xinyang on the 14th, with the assistance of tank units. They attacked on all fronts and, on the 17th and 18th, near Yanghe Town (25 kilometers northeast of Xinyang), defeated approximately 3,000 defending troops, with approximately 550 defenders killed. Another unit of Japanese forces fiercely attacked the stronghold of the 84th Army near Wenhu, southwest of Yingcheng. On the 14th and 15th, they fiercely attacked the newly arrived army, resulting in the death of 114 defenders in that battle.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Domei News Agency dispatch) – The Ministry of the Army recently announced that Lieutenant Colonel Takeo Kato of the Japanese Army had died a heroic death in battle in Burma. He has been posthumously promoted two ranks to the rank of Major General. According to another announcement by the Ministry of the Army on the 22nd, General Hajime Sugiyama, the supreme commander of the Southern Army, deeply admired Major General Kato's heroic sacrifice and awarded him a letter of commendation to commemorate his merits. The Ministry of the Army has already submitted this matter to the Emperor.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Indian Congress Party's Demands; British Authorities Adopt a Wait-and-See Attitude; Strive to Avoid Direct Confrontation, Important Talks Underway Behind the Scenes <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 22nd (Domei News Agency dispatch) – The New York Times yesterday published a dispatch from London stating that after the Indian Congress Party adopted a resolution demanding the withdrawal of British political power from India, British troops stationed there were highly likely to have a direct confrontation with the Indian Congress Party. The British government and Parliament are both striving to avoid provoking various factions in India and are adopting a wait-and-see attitude. The British government believes that the Congress' demands must be somewhat limited, but the Gandhi faction has consistently adopted a tough stance. Therefore, there is little hope of compromise between Britain and India. The current situation is extremely difficult because if India's demands are accepted, the situation will inevitably worsen. However, if they are ignored, it will inevitably provoke resentment from the entire Indian population. By then, a large-scale popular movement will be impossible to suppress.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 21st (Havas News Agency dispatch) – Recent developments in the Indian situation, especially Gandhi's pronouncements, have caused anxiety and unease among the British. The London News Chronicle recently published an article by a New Delhi correspondent, which quite adequately reflects the opinions of the government and the Liberal Party. According to the report, the newspaper, which has never supported India's independence policy, today even stated that India might openly rebel this month and that Nehru had recently traveled to various places, delivering anti-British speeches and even openly expressing armed resistance as a solution to India's independence problem. As of now, the British and Indian authorities, though remaining silent, are not entirely inactive. Important talks are currently underway behind the scenes. However, negotiations between the British and Indian nationalists will inevitably be extremely difficult, so both sides are proceeding with caution. Even if unrest occurs in India, the British will not find it difficult to quell it quickly. According to current law, the Governor-General of India could imprison Gandhi and his followers, but the British still want to do their utmost to avoid this, because if Gandhi is imprisoned again, or even goes on hunger strike again, it will inevitably lead to an unfortunate and serious incident.</p>
<p>Bangkok, 22nd (Haitong News Agency dispatch) – According to news from here last night, after fully recovering from his cold, Acharja, the chairman of the Indian Congress Party, has departed from New Delhi for Karachi. When he met with reporters before his departure and was asked whether the Indian Congress Party could cooperate with other political parties in India, Acharja replied that this was not necessary at present. The most important issue for India at present is the issue of independence. After India gains independence and British power withdraws from India, cooperation between the various political parties will not be difficult to resolve. From this, it can be seen that Acharja's attitude is completely contrary to the British claim that independence can only be discussed after complete compromise between the various political parties in India.</p>

<p>Bern, 22nd (Domei News Agency dispatch) – The Alamein desert battlefield, 70 miles from Alexandria, which is as hot as a furnace, has been in a state of ceasefire for the fourth day since last Saturday. A sandstorm is raging, and sand and gravel are flying, forcing both armies to cease operations. So far, there have been no changes in the positions of both sides.</p>

<p>Washington, 21st (Havas News Agency dispatch) – The White House announced that former Ambassador to France, Admiral William Leahy, has been transferred to Chief of Staff of the Presidential Office. Admiral Leahy, who is 67 years old, retired in 1939 when he resigned from the position of Chief of Naval Operations. This time, he is making a comeback and is again enlisted in active service. When President Roosevelt met with the press today, he refused to specify the duties of Admiral Leahy, only saying that the President is the commander-in-chief of the three branches of the armed forces during wartime, and Admiral Leahy is the Chief of Staff to the President.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Haitong News Agency dispatch) – The newly appointed Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, Admiral Leahy, will be directly responsible to President Roosevelt, because, according to the U.S. Constitution, the President is the commander-in-chief of the U.S. military. Leahy's appointment seems to be Roosevelt's answer to external demands for a person with military experience to be in charge of the supreme command. Washington political circles believe that since Roosevelt is not an expert in military affairs, the opinion of the Chief of Staff will influence future military decisions.</p>
<p>Washington, 21st (Havas News Agency dispatch) – President Roosevelt told reporters today that Secretary of State Hull plans to deliver a radio address to the nation at the end of this week, reviewing the various difficulties in the current situation and explaining the meaning of this war for the United States.</p>
<p>Close Contact Between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Stockholm, 22nd (Haitong News Agency dispatch) – According to news from London, the issue of opening a second battlefront in Europe remains the focus of discussion in Britain. The British authorities are also paying close attention to this issue. The meeting of British and U.S. military experts in London was chaired personally by Churchill. It is reported that the British government is constantly in close contact with Washington and Moscow. As to whether a definitive resolution has been reached on this issue, it is not yet known, so the information obtained by various correspondents in Sweden is quite contradictory. British public opinion seems to be divided into two factions. One faction believes that for political and military reasons, Britain must attack Europe, and if it continues to stand idly by, the war will inevitably fail. The other faction believes that an attack on Europe should not be attempted, and the threat from German submarines is great, and British and U.S. troops have not yet concentrated and are difficult to assist the Soviet Union. But it is still not known which faction is gaining the upper hand.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 22nd (Haitong News Agency dispatch) – This station obtained news from London that the British Miners' Federation held its annual meeting in Blackpool yesterday and resolved to welcome the Allied decision to establish a new front in Europe this year. The Federation believes that the seriousness of the situation makes the establishment of a second front urgent. British Minister of Fuel, Major Lloyd George, attended the meeting and asked the miners to increase production.</p>
<p>London, 25th (Havas News Agency dispatch) – Officials here refuse to disclose any information about future combat plans and declare that maintaining military secrets is a matter of course. As for the external claim that the U.S. General Staff plans to land in Western Europe, it is considered to be purely fictitious. Churchill's meetings with British and American military leaders in recent days are also customary actions and have no special significance.</p>
<h3 id="e11">U.S. Failure to Control Goods Leads to Price Increases; Anti-Inflation War Reaches Critical Stage <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Washington, 21st (Havas News Agency dispatch) – The Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor recently announced that since May 18th of this year, the prices of various goods not subject to price controls have risen by 5%. During the same period, the general cost of living has risen by 3%. This means that the rise in the past one and a half months is almost equal to the record of the past fourteen months. Observers generally say that this fact proves that the "anti-inflation war" has reached a critical stage. If the government wants to win in this area and stabilize the U.S. economic life, it must seize the opportunity and take decisive action. The U.S. authorities had even discussed various economic issues, especially the crisis of inflation, before entering the war. After entering the war on December 8, 1941, the problem became increasingly serious. Three months later, President Roosevelt issued a message calling on the nation to cooperate in eliminating the malformed state caused by the dual relationship of increased public purchasing power and the shortage of daily necessities, and suggested lowering the standard of living in order to adjust supply and demand. In addition, a large-scale tax plan was proposed, requiring the people to purchase national defense bonds with 10% of their income, so as to implement controlled economy. Economic experts at the time pointed out that the only condition for the success of this plan was to stabilize wages and agricultural product prices. At the same time, the steel workers affiliated to the left-wing Trade Union Association requested a daily wage increase of one U.S. dollar, which was met by the Wartime Labor Board proposing a compromise of a daily wage increase of 44 cents. President Roosevelt said when he met with reporters that this would lead to an increase in steel prices. Other workers in various industries, having the precedent of the steel industry to follow, are making similar demands, especially the demands of farmers, thus creating a serious difficulty. The government has already purchased everything as much as possible to stabilize the prices of agricultural products. President Roosevelt has consistently advocated restoring the standard of living to its original level in full. In other words, the purchasing power of the "farm dollar" should be equal to that of the prosperous period of 1909-1914. As of now, the price level of agricultural products is set at 110%. After a lengthy debate, the government, disregarding the opposition of agricultural groups, decided to sell a portion of stored wheat below the 100% level. The Senate then passed a law forcing the government to offer credit loans for six major agricultural products. The result of this move will inevitably lead to price increases, but government spokespersons did not oppose the passage of this bill and even fully approved it. In short, while economists and even politicians are fighting this complex problem, criticisms of Federal Price Adjustment Commissioner Henderson are growing deeper. The inflation theory has become increasingly powerful. A fight is possible at any time between the Price Control Board and its enemies. President Roosevelt told reporters today that he would soon submit a message to Congress on the issue of inflation, because the stability of the cost of living is an important issue in domestic affairs and must be resolved in order for the war to proceed smoothly, and he said that his message would list various measures to control wages in order to strictly control prices, but he did not intend to "freeze wages".</p>

However, the fuel actually allocated to these railways each month is only 7,000 tons, so labor has no choice but to continue to reduce it.</p>

<h3 id="e19">Near Rostov, Fierce Fighting Underway; Germans Claim Soviet Lines Have Been Shattered <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>From a location near the Ukrainian border, 20th, Havas Agency dispatch: On the Eastern Front in the South, there was no major change today. German forces continued their offensive, while the Red Army launched repeated counterattacks, failing to capture any significant towns. The Red Army High Command plans to concentrate its forces and, under optimal conditions, execute a general retreat to reorganize troops behind the lines. This strategy has been completed in the southeastern areas of Voronezh and Millerovo. However, along the Donets River line, the Red Army suffered heavy losses, and it is anticipated that the Germans will capture a large number of Red Army soldiers. The battle situation in each area is detailed below.  In the Voronezh area, fierce fighting continues south of the city, with the Red Army attempting to repel the German forces occupying the east bank of the Don River. However, there has been no change in the front lines, and both sides have suffered extremely heavy losses. The Hungarian Third Army is also participating in this fierce battle.  In the Don River basin, fierce fighting is taking place between Kachalinskaya and Ilovlinskaya. The German forces are attacking Stalingrad on one front and launching an offensive north of Voronezh on another. It is speculated that their objective is either to seize the triangular area between Voronezh, Stalingrad, and Kuibyshev, or to establish a secure zone to protect the German left flank. According to some sources, German forces have reached the town of Raispopinskaya, 30 miles northwest of Stalingrad, but heavy rains have slowed their advance to an average of 12 to 15 miles per day.  In the Millerovo area, the Red Army's position is critical. After capturing the city, German forces advanced in two directions: one eastward towards Stalingrad and the other southeastward, isolating Rostov and the Red Army forces fighting along the Donets River. The Red Army High Command has ordered that Rostov be defended at all costs. In the past three days, the situation southwest of the city has remained unchanged, and attempts by the German coalition forces to widen the breach have been unsuccessful. Furthermore, along the Donets River, German forces have reached a line from Kamensk-Shakhtinsky, Krasny Sulin, and Gukovo, extending westward to Rostov. The details of this front line are still unclear. What is known is that the Red Army will engage in large-scale warfare between Novocherkassk and Rostov.</p>
<p>German Headquarters, 22nd, Domei News Agency dispatch: This afternoon's German military report stated that the enemy forces resisting in the Rostov area have been defeated. German and allied forces are now before the bridgehead strongholds. Italian forces captured the Krasny Luch area on July 19th, a significant coal region, capturing many prisoners and an immeasurable amount of war booty. North and northwest of Voronezh, enemy forces attacked, leading to prolonged and fierce fighting. Twenty-five Soviet tanks were destroyed. Behind the central sector of the Eastern Front, the trapped enemy forces have been annihilated. South of Lake Ilmen and near Volkhov, several enemy attacks were repulsed with heavy enemy losses. German forces defending the bridgehead destroyed 31 enemy tanks. German dive bombers attacked enemy artillery units on the Rybachi Peninsula. Between July 8th and 20th, Soviet aircraft losses totaled 829, including 660 shot down in aerial combat, 62 shot down by anti-aircraft guns, 9 shot down by the army, and the rest destroyed on the ground. During the same period, German aircraft losses on the Eastern Front were only 70.</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd, Domei News Agency dispatch: Following Moscow's propaganda about a successful Soviet counteroffensive in Voronezh, the German High Command issued a statement on Tuesday denying the Soviet claims. It is reported that the authorities will soon release a map showing the positions of German and Soviet forces. The German offensive on the Don River is now advancing rapidly to the east and south. German forces are now just 90 kilometers east of Kharkov and only 160 kilometers from Stalingrad. General Timoshenko's only remaining railway line connecting with Moscow and the Caucasus is just seven kilometers from the Don River. If German forces reach the Don River, that railway will be within German artillery range. In terms of transporting military supplies, the Volga River is even more crucial than the railway. Stalingrad is a transportation hub with many munitions factories, making it extremely important to Timoshenko. Rostov is now under attack from three sides, and its fate seems sealed.</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd, Domei News Agency dispatch: Today's communique from the German High Command stated that the Soviet lines near Rostov have collapsed.</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd, Domei News Agency dispatch: This afternoon's German military report stated that German forces in the Taganrog area have also begun to advance towards Rostov, so the entire front line is moving forward to attack Rostov. German air support has been significant, inflicting heavy blows on Soviet positions, transportation lines, and the southern outskirts of Rostov.</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd, Domei News Agency dispatch: This afternoon's communique from the German High Command stated that German forces have widely crossed the lower reaches of the Don River.</p>
<p>Moscow, 21st, Havas Agency dispatch: The Red Army High Command has just released a military report stating: "Today, our forces fought bravely in the Voronezh area and southeast of Voroshilovgrad. There were no major changes in other theaters of operation."</p>
<p>Eastern Front Rain Continues Unabated, All Battles Bogged Down in Mud</p>
<p>From a location near the German border, 21st, Havas Agency dispatch: Three hundred and ninety-four days have passed since the outbreak of the German-Soviet War. The most notable phenomenon today is the increasing pressure exerted by German forces on Rostov.  Since the German forces gained a foothold on the right bank of the Don River, they have been advancing along the lower reaches of the river, currently probing the defenses of Rostov from the west. Furthermore, two other German forces are converging on this strategically important city from the north and west.  Between the Donets and Don Rivers, German forces are engaged in annihilation operations. German mobile units, after crossing the Donets River, have penetrated deep into enemy territory, creating pocket formations. Red Army resistance has been fierce, especially in the Shakhty district, where major tank and assault force battles are underway. The weather on the Eastern Front is poor. Heavy rains have been falling continuously since the 19th of this month, slowing the German offensive. According to reports from Italian war correspondents, such heavy rain is only seen in tropical regions, and the rain is mixed with hail, turning all roads into mud. Tanks, trucks, and horses are bogged down in the mud, unable to advance quickly. This situation is similar to that in Ukraine last autumn. In the Voronezh area, German forces are able to control the overall situation. Although the Soviet Union has not acknowledged the complete German occupation of the city, in fact, the city is located on the west bank of the Don River and is completely in German hands. However, the suburbs east of the river, which originally belonged to the city, have not yet fallen.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 22nd, Havas Agency dispatch: According to sources close to intelligence circles here, the vanguard of German forces advancing from the east on the southern sector of the Soviet front has reached the outskirts of Rostov and is now only two and a half miles from the city center.</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd, Havas Agency dispatch: A local radio station has just announced that a large-scale annihilation battle is underway on the southern sector of the Eastern Front. The encircled Red Army is facing organized annihilation.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 22nd, Domei News Agency dispatch: Since the recent meeting of the All-India Congress Committee's Working Committee in Wardha, the Indian independence movement's attitude towards Britain has become increasingly firm. However, there are still aspects of their resolutions that are not entirely thorough. A commentary in the Asahi Shimbun here on the 22nd commented on this, stating that, objectively speaking, the new resolutions of this meeting are quite promising. We sincerely hope for the complete independence of India and the realization of "India for Indians." If necessary, Japan should provide all possible assistance to ensure a satisfactory resolution of the Indian question. It also stated that the Working Committee's resolutions acknowledge the coexistence of Indian and foreign troops. If so, British troops will still hold a considerable advantage in India. Whether this incomplete state can be considered genuine independence for India is the biggest question. At this time of the Greater East Asia War, Britain has stationed its powerful forces in India, our neighbor, which we cannot tolerate. As long as the British are in control, even if only one British or American soldier remains in India, it is impossible to expect Japan not to sweep them away.</p>

<p>Istanbul, 21st, Havas Agency dispatch: Regarding the fortification of the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits and the passage of ships of all nations, the Turkish government invited the signatory countries of the Treaty of Lausanne to a conference in 1936, which resulted in the Montreux Convention. The convention allowed Turkey to fortify the straits and stipulated detailed regulations for the control of the passage of ships of all nations in peacetime and wartime. Today marks the sixth anniversary of the convention's establishment, and the entire country is celebrating. Newspapers are publishing articles praising the convention's significant contribution to international justice. The Vatan newspaper stated that before the Montreux Convention, warships of all nations could freely enter and exit the straits. Thinking about it now, if there had been no such convention, the fate of the current war would have been completely different. As for Turkey, its neutrality is solely reliant on this convention. Therefore, we must celebrate the anniversary of this convention as a major victory for the nation, benefiting not only our country but also our neighboring countries.</p>

<p>Special Report from This Newspaper</p>
<h3 id="e30">Lourenço Marques: The Exchange Point for Nationals of Belligerent Countries - 1 <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>According to a report in yesterday's English-language Times, the repatriation ship "Conte Verde," which departed from this city on the 29th of last month, and another ship, the "Asama Maru," which departed from Japan, are scheduled to arrive today in Lourenço Marques in the Mozambique Channel, a Portuguese colony in East Africa.</p>
<p>The passengers on the "Conte Verde" number 336, including 549 Americans, 20 Canadians, 14 Mexicans, 13 Brazilians, and 7 British citizens. In terms of occupation, there are diplomats, clergy, merchants, and ordinary expatriates, with diplomats being the most numerous. The day the "Conte Verde" left Shanghai was windy and rainy, which could also be used to describe their fate. However, they are fortunate to be able to embark on a journey back to their homeland.</p>
<p>Without this exchange of nationals from belligerent countries, the name Lourenço Marques would likely be unfamiliar to most readers. It is no accident that the belligerent countries chose this location as the exchange point for each other's nationals, because it is a port in Mozambique, a territory of neutral Portugal in East Africa. Although it may seem remote at ordinary times, it is still a hub between Britain and the United States in today's wartime situation. Mozambique, in the original text, is spelled Mozambique, commonly known as Portuguese East Africa. This area was demarcated based on the Anglo-Portuguese Agreement of June 1891. After the end of the last World War, the great powers merged a portion of German East Africa into Portuguese East Africa and recognized Portugal's sovereign rights there. The total area of Portuguese East Africa is 297,657 square miles, divided into two parts: one is the directly ruled territory of Portugal (245,776 square miles), and the other is the territory ruled by local governments. The directly ruled territory is divided into seven districts, namely Inhambane, Quelimane, Tete, Mozambique, Cabo Delgado, Nyassa, and Lourenço Marques, which is discussed in this article.</p>
<p>Lourenço Marques is the name of the region and also the name of the port. It is an important port in Portuguese East Africa and also the capital of Portuguese East Africa—the seat of government. As a port, many products of Portuguese East Africa, such as sugar, cotton, hemp, wheat, and minerals, are exported through it to various parts of the world. At the same time, various foreign goods, such as fabrics, daily necessities, and machinery, are also imported through it into every corner of Portuguese East Africa. According to wartime investigations, its annual exports are approximately 50 million Portuguese currency, and its imports are approximately 55 million Portuguese currency. Because this is the channel for Portuguese African imports and exports, ship traffic is quite frequent. According to statistics from 1939, 1,120 ships entered the port, totaling 5,786,324 tons, and 1,127 ships departed, totaling 5,800,304 tons. After the war, ships from various countries mostly moor here, and the number of ships near the pier is... the condition is that the Portuguese government's policy is not to maintain its position here with military force, and naturally, it would not dare to think of using this as a base to gradually expand its influence. For this reason, the Portuguese force in the entire Portuguese East Africa, including officers, is no more than 2,800 men.</p>
<p>Some say that Lourenço Marques is a peaceful port. I think this may be the reality. Flags of all colors are flying on the riverbank. You don't interfere with me, I don't interfere with you. It fully presents the colors of a neutral country.</p>
<p>The government of Portuguese East Africa—referring to the directly ruled territory of the Portuguese government—includes two institutions: a legislative assembly and an executive council. The legislative assembly is organized by representatives elected from various levels of society, while the executive council and the governors of each district are appointed by the Portuguese government. According to a 1930 survey, the population within the territory is 3,995,831 (including 35,570 Europeans), with Lourenço Marques having the largest number, numbering 42,779 (1931 statistics). Education in Lourenço Marques is not considered high, but in remote East Africa, it is relatively developed. Borrowing the figures investigated in The Statesman’s Year Book, there are 28 primary schools and eight high primary schools here. In addition, there is also a central senior school and seven specialized academies.</p>
<p>Lourenço Marques is an important port, but it does not have the military atmosphere of Alexandria. It is not that Lourenço Marques is not worthy of being a military port—it has an excellent military port... at least it can be said so today. Otherwise, the belligerent countries would not choose this place as the exchange point for nationals. After landing here, nationals of various countries will embark on the journey to return to their homeland. In the distant East, we wish them to reach this place sooner and to board another ship sooner and return to the embrace of their motherland.</p>

<h3 id="e36">Authorities Order the Establishment of Contracted Rice Shops to Abide by Grain Distribution Regulations; Shortages in Issuing Household Rations Are Prohibited; Violators Will Be Prosecuted According to Contract <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>After the authorities of the two concessions implemented ration distribution based on population, all rice shops that contracted to distribute household rations must operate in accordance with the regulations. Now, the Rice and Grain Management Office specifically orders all rice shops to abide by the "Regulations to be Observed." Violators will be considered as violating the contracted agreement and will be prosecuted and punished according to law.  Sales reports must be submitted by each shop every week. The previous week's report must be submitted every Monday. Recently, more than twenty rice shops have delayed submitting their reports and have already been warned separately.  The ration tickets taken back from the sale of household rations should be affixed to the sales report. The numbers on the tickets should match the numbers of each rice shop. If, due to negligence, tickets with numbers from other locations are collected and affixed, a fine of 20 yuan will be imposed for each ticket upon discovery.  If the amount of rice sold by a rice shop exceeds the amount of rice stated on the returned tickets, a fine of ten times the overage rice price will be imposed.  There must be no shortage of remaining grain stored in the rice shop. Violators will be fined ten times the value of the shortage amount.  Rice shops must issue rations based on tickets. Rice is calculated in "sheng" (升, a unit of volume), and flour is calculated in "jin" (斤, a unit of weight) and "bang" (磅, pound). There must be no shortage in weight.  Rice shops must open for business during regular hours every day of the week (Monday to Saturday). Regardless of who it is, and regardless of which day it is, if they hold ration tickets to purchase household rations, and if the numbers match, they must not be refused.</p>
<p>Fourth Phase Ration Payment and Collection</p>
<p>The fourth phase of ration distribution will begin on Monday, the 27th of this month, and will end on Saturday, August 　. The 659 contracted rice shops in the Public Concession and the French Concession have all followed the regulations and collected purchase orders in the previous two days, paid for 309.3 yuan worth of white rice and 93 yuan worth of flour, and picked up the goods from the designated Swire and Zhejiang Xing warehouses. Distribution will proceed as scheduled. It is reported that the fourth phase of rations will be one "sheng" of white rice and half a "jin" of flour. Broken rice distribution will be temporarily suspended. However, the exact quantities and prices are still awaiting announcement by the authorities.</p>
<p>Revised Announcement: Flour Selling Price</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office announced that, regarding the matter of changing the price limits for flour and flour-based foods, Public Notice No. 6007 was issued on the 21st of this month and implemented on the 23rd of this month. It has now been found that the retail price of flour should be revised to 2.27 yuan per "shi jin" (市斤, a unit of weight) or 2.06 yuan per pound. All other items will be handled in accordance with the previous announcement.</p>

<p>Recently, a hurricane blew from the sea near the Ryukyu Islands towards the Yellow Sea. The wind force is very strong, making it the first hurricane of the year. It has already reached the sea off Shantou and is advancing rapidly northwest at a speed of 30 meters. The city's shipping industry received a hurricane report yesterday afternoon. If the direction does not change, the city is at risk of being hit today. After 3 p.m. yesterday afternoon, the wind gradually became stronger and even stronger at night. For caution, all ships stopped exporting last night. It is also understood that the Dalian Maru, which operates the North China route and was scheduled to depart from Shanghai at 9 a.m. this morning to Qingdao and Dalian, notified passengers yesterday evening that, in order to avoid the hurricane, the departure has been postponed and rescheduled for tomorrow.</p>

<p>Chinese merchant ships entrusted to foreign merchant management have suspended operations since the outbreak of the Pacific War for more than half a year, resulting in small losses. Recently, in order to seek a way forward, various companies have consulted with Dongya, Zhonghua, and Yamashita companies to act as agents, separated from foreign merchants, restored the ship names, and changed　flags. Many have already implemented this, as detailed in previous reports. It is now learned that the Haikang ship, managed by the German Runwen Foreign Firm, has also left the German business and has entrusted Zhonghua Company to manage it. All procedures have been completed. Renamed　Feng, it will operate on the Jiangbei line and is scheduled to depart this Saturday (i.e., the 25th) from the Shanghai Municipal Council wharf on the Bund at Simalu.

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office announced that the Council has already implemented separate public notices regarding the collection of a 10% tax on restaurant and hotel bills and a 2% tax on separately sold goods. However, it has been reported that recently some people have been enticing citizens to refrain from paying the above two taxes and extorting fees, which is completely untrue. Since these people have no way to exempt any taxes that should be paid according to regulations, nor can they guarantee　that those who do not pay the tax will be exempt from punishment, citizens should not lightly believe their words. In the future, if taxpayers encounter the aforementioned people, they should immediately report to Office No. 263 of this Council, or call 12810 and dial extension 20 to notify them for investigation. For detailed information on paying the above two taxes, please consult the above office.</p>

It is said that they are expected to arrive here tomorrow (the 23rd) or the day after tomorrow. British nationals in other ports and inland areas may soon hurry to Shanghai to await evacuation, as the Japanese ship Ryuta Maru is scheduled to depart from Shanghai on August 3rd and sail to Lorenco Marques. Those evacuating from other ports to Shanghai will generally depart on this ship. Another Japanese ship for repatriating British nationals, the Kamakura Maru, is scheduled to arrive here from Yokohama on August 14th and depart from Shanghai on August 16th. Those who come to Shanghai from other ports and inland areas too late to board the Ryuta Maru will travel on the Kamakura Maru.

<p>Wang Weiyuan, the owner of the Wang Jinxiu Zhai jewelry store at 521 Xiafei Road, his wife Wang Mian, and his adopted daughter Qu Huida, were stabbed to death on the 　16th of last month. Wang Mian was killed and Qu Huida was injured. The police arrested Jin Fugen, the owner of the Changxing Huadian shop, as the murderer. Details were reported previously. This case was further investigated by Gui Baoquan, Chief Inspector of the Criminal Division of the French Concession Police, Inspector Zhou Buguang, and Detective Wei Yuansheng. It was found that the mastermind behind the case was actually Wang Yangshi (41 years old, a local), Wang Weiyuan's　mother. In addition to Jin Fugen, the perpetrators also included Tang Wenxiang (　13 years old) and Wang Caigen (17 years old), former employees of the store from Jiading. At the time, Tang was holding a rope, and after entering, he used a stool to kill the child. Wang was carrying a hatchet. All three criminals were captured the day before yesterday. Because Wang Yangshi is six months pregnant, she has been transferred to Guangci Hospital to await childbirth before interrogation. It is also rumored that the mastermind, Wang Yangshi, used to have an affair with the store employee Gao Shou, which was once discovered by Wang Weiyuan and reported to his father. Therefore, she resented him deeply. Later, after Wang's father died, the mother and son each took over a store, becoming bitter enemies. Tang Wenxiang stayed in Wang Weiyuan's store as an employee, but was later dismissed by Wang, leading him to conspire to kill Wang. Because Wang went to Suzhou, they plotted to harm his children.</p>

<p>Since the application for this newspaper's third reader scholarship fund began on the 20th, students from various schools with financial difficulties have been enthusiastically coming to the office to collect forms, which shows the urgent need for scholarships among the general youth in Shanghai. Due to the sharp increase in fees at various schools, the current fund is less than 100,000 yuan, while there are many applicants for scholarships. There is great concern that there will be too few resources for too many people, making distribution difficult. In addition to appealing to all sectors for enthusiastic donations, the review procedures must be strictly handled, and the deadline will be shortened. The deadline for collecting application registration forms is the 25th of this month, and the deadline for accepting application registration forms is the 28th of this month. In other words, there are still one or two days left today, tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow to collect the forms. Forms will no longer be issued from the 26th, and there are still six days left to accept forms. Acceptance will be refused from the 29th. At the same time, those whose scores in the　subject grade and overall average do not meet the standards, or whose procedures are not met, or whose writing is careless, will all be rejected. Applicants should pay close attention. After the application form is submitted, it is hoped that you will pay attention to this newspaper's announcements later.</p>

<p>A branch report from the Allied News Agency states that the Economic Section of the Shanghai Japanese Consulate General recently held two major economic conferences, with the aim of investigating the status of price controls in Shanghai. The final collective meeting was held yesterday morning, and it was resolved to amend the differences in prices charged by Japanese and Chinese merchants selling important goods. Another meeting will soon be held in Nanjing to study the basic policies for controlling prices. The Japanese　Consulate General here will reissue the notice promulgated at the end of 1940, implementing commodity labeling and issuing invoices, which is also part of the control measures. At the final collective meeting held yesterday, representatives from the Japanese Consulate Generals in Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Wuhu requested to obtain reports on Shanghai's price trends, as they have a strong impact on inland prices. The meeting also decided to implement a plan for liaison between various control agencies to promote the exchange of goods between Shanghai and the interior.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Suicide of an Antique Dealer <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Tao Zhengang, a 31-year-old antique dealer from Shaoxing, committed suicide due to　financial difficulties. On the 17th night, he was heard　to have gone　to Chunri No. 2 Inn at 　7 Aiduya Road in the French Concession to borrow a room. He committed suicide by swallowing opium that night. The next day, the boy who served tea discovered him and sent him to Shirenji Hospital for treatment, but he died before yesterday. The French Concession police sent the body to the autopsy office. Yesterday, Shantang prepared the coffin and waited for relatives to claim it.</p>
<h3 id="e49">List of Free Tuition Quotas Donated by Various Schools in Support of This Newspaper's Scholarship Campaign <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>(Note) The donation of free tuition quotas by the above schools to benefit impoverished scholars is commendable and admirable. Initially, there were other schools donating half-tuition quotas, but because the procedures for handling half-tuition quotas by this newspaper are complicated, they are not listed. It is best to reduce the half-tuition quota and change it to a free tuition quota, which will greatly benefit impoverished scholars, and this newspaper will be happy to recommend them. We also hope to receive another letter to inform us for processing.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Talking About Old Bookstores <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Browsing old bookstores for used books seems like a humble and frugal act to some. Because books, excluding exquisitely bound editions from the Song and Yuan dynasties, are similar to 　 antiques, 　they can be preserved without discussion. The rest are better new than old. Once a book has gone through the　"sale" process, at least its appearance is no longer very attractive, and its content　is quite suspect. In　countries with developed foreign publishing, it is extremely common for a book to have one edition a year or even several or dozens of editions. The attitude of general authors is also so serious that each reprint must be made. Content revision, if everyone were like Liang Qichao, "Today's me should fight with yesterday's me," before a few years, the content of the same work by the same author would be completely different. However, old bookstores still have their unique support: first, used books are relatively cheaper; second, there are books that are out of print and cannot be obtained elsewhere.</p>
<p>Past Prosperity</p>
<p>Examining the old book market in Shanghai, before the war, it could be divided into four major centers. The area around Hengbang Bridge on North Sichuan Road had about a dozen shops, originally specializing in textbooks and had the richest collection. The few shops on Fourth Malu and Third Malu focused more on Chinese ancient books and original old books, which were only supplementary businesses. The ones located in the area around the City God Temple Huanlong Bridge were very large in scale and had the most diverse collections. In addition to old books, there were also rubbings and calligraphy. Old Ximen Zhonghua Road Penglai Road was regarded as the second largest market for old books. Not only were old bookstores lined up there, but it also had a unique feature not found elsewhere: namely, there were many old book stalls. One pile in the east, one stall in the west, all set up on the ground. As you slowly　walked past, it was like breaking into Zhuge Liang's Bagua Formation. It was probably unlikely to gain a rare harvest there, because what was displayed was only some old woodblock textbooks, old magazines, and the like. However, the price was very cheap.</p>
<p>Temporary Decline</p>
<p>When the Shanghai war broke out, most of the old book market was in the war zone, so of course there was no room to stand. Therefore, some moved and some closed down. Some of the original shops also shrank into stalls. I once bumped into an old book stall owner who used to run an old bookstore on Hengbang Bridge. I was very familiar with him. Now he has turned into　sitting on the ground with dozens of broken books to sell, like a white-haired palace maid, showing a look of unbearable vicissitudes. He chattered and complained about how good business used to be, with thick capital and high profits. Even an encyclopedia would be handled more than ten　times a year.</p>
<p>Pan Guanshi Paints Fans: Calligrapher Pan Jia　is known as a contemporary master in emulating Han dynasty calligraphy. Since the beginning of summer, he has been collaborating with female painter Bao Yahui to paint fans. Requests have been flooding in. Due to the large number of accumulated pieces and the time-consuming writing, it is planned to accept another 50 pieces and then stop. Each fan has calligraphy and painting on both sides, and the fee will still be reduced by 100 yuan. The receiving addresses are Lixin Certified Public Accountants, Wang Xingji, Jiuhuatang, Duoyunxuan Rongshizhai.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Lost and Found <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>At approximately 10:00 a.m. on July 17, 1942, a money bag was found near the vaccination center at No. 124 Mintini Road, containing banknotes and various documents. The owner can claim it from the Hygiene Department of the French Municipal Council at No. 630 Beile Road.</p>
<p>Feng Qishan, a Chinese detective of the Central Police Department, recently cracked a case of embezzlement of lost property and recovered two straw hats and a handbag containing motorcycle parts. According to investigation, the item was lost near Guangdong Road Sichuan Road between the 10th and 20th of last month. However, because the plaintiff could not be identified, a special notice is hereby given that anyone who has lost this item may come to the Baotan Room of the police station every day from 4:00 p.m. to identify and claim it.</p>

<p>The Situation of Revival</p>
<p>In the past year or two, due to the soaring price of newsprint and the extraordinary difficulty of printing, the prices of books published by many large bookstores have increased tenfold. Apart from textbooks, general important reference books and literary books are no longer printed, and once they are sold out, that's it. As a result, readers who have the money but cannot buy new books, and those who are economically disadvantaged and cannot afford new books, have to turn to used bookstores. Although the prices of used books may not necessarily be very cheap at the moment, they are always more cost-effective than new books.</p>
<p>Newly Opened Markets</p>
<p>Due to the above reasons, used bookstores have temporarily turned from decline to a trend of revival. It goes without saying that the original Simalu area is particularly prosperous. The newly opened market is the area around Avenue Haig and Carter Road. In the past, there were also three or four used bookstores, but the situation was deserted and desolate, which was definitely not comparable to the lively situation on Huanlong Bridge and Zhonghua Road. Now things gather according to type, and those who used to open in Hongkou and Nanshi have moved here in a swarm. Moreover, because the area is surrounded by schools, a group of students are undoubtedly good customers of used bookstores. Therefore, a prosperous and bright scene has formed a situation of confrontation with the Simalu area. In addition, the markets on Avenue Edward VII and Route Lafayette (around the intersection of Rue Massenet) are also new developments after the war. Unfortunately, there are more stalls than shops, similar to the situation on Penglai Road in those years.</p>
<p>The Psychology of Gold Panning</p>
<p>The motive for visiting stores is not just to find cheaper items. On beautiful spring days, with nothing to do, casually flipping through old books in a store or at a stall is also a kind of fun. If you accidentally buy a few books at an extremely cheap price that you have been searching for for a long time and have not yet seen, the joy and happiness are beyond words. Ten years ago, I had a hobby of collecting magazines, ancient and modern famous books, and photographic illustrations. I introduced my friend Weng Liuxiong to be my comrade. After work, we always went to the used bookstores in Nanshi together. Our password was "going to pan for gold". We carefully selected books from many messy piles, with the eager psychology of finding gold in the sand, and often returned fully loaded. We did this for five or six years. I collected more than 3,000 items, and Weng collected even more than that. We didn't spend a lot of money, but the interest was extremely strong. Later, they were stored in a friend's house in Nanshi, and they were burned to ashes in the "August 13th" battle. I still feel heartache when I think about it now.</p>
<p>Looking Ahead</p>
<p>According to my observation, under the current extraordinary circumstances, used bookstores will only become more prosperous day by day. The main reason is naturally that the publishing industry is in a slump and the prices of new books are too high, forcing readers to lower their standards. On the other hand, the war has caused a large number of private or public collections of books to circulate on the market like waste paper, which is a major driving force for the prosperity of used bookstores.</p>
<p>A Miracle</p>
<p>A friend bought four volumes of Li Changji's collection for two yuan. He didn't pay attention to it. When a publisher saw it, he said it was a Song edition. From then on, the clerk of the used bookstore was shocked. They came and went, and refused to let go. As a result, the friend sold it for 6,000 yuan. A few days later, the Li Changji collection, which originally cost two yuan, was treasured in the study of a wealthy man in Nanxun. It is said that the cost was 22,000 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Public Bonds Only Show Floating Households Emerging <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the public bond grey market's condition became tired once again. All bonds uniformly trended downward because many floating multi-household bonds came out. Small money shops also had multiple long positions exit. Recently, funds have been tight, and high interest rates have been a major cause of the public bond selloff. After the control of various goods, public bonds have also been affected considerably. Although their foundation is very solid, current transactions are very short-sighted, seeking only immediate gains and not planning for the long term. They are not investors. Looking at the large amount of spot goods previously collected by major customers, they have not been seen to spit them out, which shows the value of the public bonds themselves. Yesterday, Tong Shun, Qian Yi, and Chang Ji all came out, but there were also considerable buyers. As a result, the market price uniformly fell by one or two corners to six corners. The turnover was about 800,000 to 900,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category High Low Closing Compared to the previous day</p>
<h3 id="e57">Shanghai Cotton Textile Stocks Eager Buyers <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The situation of Chinese stocks has not been as soft as in the past few days, and has turned firm and stable. Dasheng No. 3 Factory saw a high price of 220 yuan, and finally rose another 5 yuan. Financial stocks Damu and Guohua Bank had buyers active. Zhabei Water and Electricity did see a reaction, rebounding to over 40 yuan, with a high of 43 yuan, and finally rose 2 yuan and 5 jiao. Chinese Electrical Company tended to stabilize. Department stores Wing On and Sincere declined slightly. Underwear rebounded by 5 jiao. Shanghai Cotton Textile had eager buyers, rising by over 1 yuan. Great China Match turned stable. Xinya of the new pharmaceutical industry rose slightly. The rest were flat and tired. Pudong Electric rose to the 100 yuan mark. Turnover increased daily. People's hearts were firm and stable. The stock market price list is recorded below: Stock Name High Low</p>

<p>Yesterday, the retail price of decorated gold at the front doors of local silver buildings did not change, remaining at 2,250 yuan per tael (350 yuan less for purchases). The inter-dealer price was initially 1,950 yuan, then fell to around 1,930 yuan, more than 20 yuan lower than the previous day, with a difference of about 20 yuan. Transactions were even rarer.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Interest Rates as High as Two Corners <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Money Shops Association's interest rates rose by another point, reaching two corners, a consecutive rise of three days, reaching a huge nine points. It is said that the discount on new exchange check notes was flat.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the stock market situation was quite stable. The inter-dealer price of Japanese military tickets once reached 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 4 fen, 7.8 li. Silver shops and small money shops sold at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 and a half fen and 6 fen, with purchases at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 4 fen, with little difference from the previous day's price.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Cotton Cloth Decline Also Strong <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the factory cloth market fell with eastern fabrics, and the recovery was also light. Coarse and fine cloths fell by as much as 5 yuan per bolt. 16-pound Globe coarse cloth was 178 yuan, Flying Goose 176 yuan, 9-pound New Character 110 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong 106 yuan, 12-pound Globe fine cloth 165 yuan, Dapeng 160 yuan, Fugui 162 yuan, Magnolia bleached cloth 165 yuan.

<h3 id="e61">Decline of Velvet <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Since the strict price limit on velvet, the Japanese factory's velvet price was the first to report a decline. People's hearts are weak, and silver money shops refuse to pledge velvet loans. Three or four velvet shops in Qipan Street have been punished one after another. On the one hand, due to the abundant output of unprofessional small speculators, yesterday's velvet market, except for overcoats, all fell in price. Yinfeng Yuanzhi tribute velvet sold for 220 yuan, Zangqing grass green umbrella velvet 200 yuan, Dalong sheep velvet 170 yuan, Yihe Palikas 105 yuan, Baoxin Lianxin hemp cloth, gray 10 yuan 05 jiao, white 10 yuan, beige 9 yuan 5 jiao.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Yeast Sales Are Booming, All Due to Noodles Instead of Rice <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Recently, yeast has been popular for a while. At first, it was only used by Western families or Shandong people to make bread, so sales were very small. Since the distribution of flour for household rations, although it is in the category of selling at will, the allocated rice is far from enough to satisfy hunger. Southerners also have to learn from the north to use noodles instead of rice. In addition, the flour distributed this week is rich in moisture, quickly forming lumps and particles, and is urgently used to make cakes and buns to fill food. Therefore, the yeast sold in various foreign wine and food stores is very prosperous, with each piece selling for 5 jiao and can mix 5 pounds of flour.</p>

<p>The first batch of Suqian vegetables has arrived in Xu. The goods on the market there are gradually increasing, so the production price is gradually loosening. According to Xu Zhou Lei News yesterday, the price of Gao Suqian vegetables, such as truckloads of goods, including all external expenses, delivered to the Shanghai station is 110 yuan of Allied currency.</p>

<p>— Wu Dai</p>
<p>If a person wants to succeed in life, he must believe in himself. Believe in his own ability. Believe in his work.</p>
<p>Whether you are a soldier, a bookkeeper, a pastor or a painter; whether you are a mechanic, a worker, a farmer or a writer, unless you believe that you can contribute to the needs of the world, make mankind happier, and make society more progressive, you are bound to fail.</p>
<p>You will fail because you lack faith in your work.</p>
<p>The manager of a large company interviews all salesmen who come to apply, and then hires them. He said, "I must first know that our salesmen understand our goods, believe in the value of our goods, and then he can succeed as a good goods salesman."</p>
<p>We must have the same feeling for ourselves and our work, because what we contribute to the world is part of ourselves and our work.</p>
<p>We have confidence, and then we can make the people who come into contact with us also have confidence.</p>
<p>We have courage, and then we can inspire the courage of others.</p>
<p>We believe, believe in ourselves, believe in mankind, believe in the progress of society, and then we can arouse the same belief in others.</p>
<p>We have the power to influence others, and we have the obligation to use this power to help others.</p>
<p>But we must understand this power. We must believe in ourselves. (Adapted from Clayton's original work)</p>

<h3 id="e70">Electrical Invisibility Cannon <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Mo Jin</p>
<p>When people talk about cannons, or see the words "cannon" on paper, our eardrums will feel a huge and terrible sound of cannons. This frightening sound is because the explosion sound is generated when the cannonball is fired out by using the action of explosives when firing the cannon. Although the "rumbling" sound can make the enemy soldiers tremble and lose courage, it also allows the enemy to detect the stronghold of the army based on the sound of the cannon and the strong smoke and fire generated during the cannon firing, and counterattack. This is the only shortcoming of the cannon.</p>
<p>Recently, inventors have designed a special cannon that makes up for the above shortcomings. That is, when firing the cannon, the action of electricity is used to quickly fire the cannonball. There is no sound, no smoke. The biggest feature of this cannon is that it prevents the opponent from knowing where the cannonball came from. They only see the ground bloom and come and go without a trace. They don't know where the artillery is hiding. The vast battlefield gives people a sense that every tree and bush is an enemy soldier. It can really make people impossible to guard against.</p>
<p>The structure of this gas cannon is equivalent to an electric motor. The front half of the cannonball is equipped with a "squirrel cage armature", and the inner wall of the cannon body is equipped with "spiral coils". When firing the cannon, load the cannonball into the cannon body. As long as a current is applied, the cannonball will rotate rapidly due to the action of the lightning magnetic induction, and be pushed away from the muzzle at an extremely high speed. After reaching the destination, the drug inside the cannonball will explode violently under the control of the "time device", just like an ordinary cannonball.</p>
<p>To be able to fire a cannon without sound or smoke is just like people dreaming that with invisibility, they can hold a white blade and act recklessly. This electrical cannon seems to be wearing an invisibility cannon coat for the ordinary cannon. Killing people in the dark can be called "invisibility cannon".</p>

<p>According to "Old Master", it is usually used to mean "not very clever". I don't know if this car dealership took this name to "sell old" or to "be humble"?</p>

<h3 id="e72">Unfulfilled Ambition <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Mu</p>
<p>I had a close friend who died of time sickness shortly after graduating from college. This gentleman was young and handsome, with great ambitions. His father was the only son of his elderly parents. Unfortunately, he died in a foreign land. As a close friend, I first went through the formalities at the People's Hospital for him, and later I went through the funeral arrangements for him. His parents in his hometown, who suddenly received the sad news of their beloved son's premature death, were of course overwhelmed with grief. Afterwards, I wrote a letter to report to them the situation of their son's death, and to offer condolences and comfort. Finally, I told them a story.</p>
<p>I said in the letter: "I really can't find anything to comfort you. But I remember a Western story that once, a few adventurous European youths went to the Alps to climb mountains. Unexpectedly, on the mountain, one of the youths accidentally fell from the glacier into a deep valley and was instantly buried by the snow. One of his companions who studied science calculated that on a certain day of a certain month after many years, when the snow on the mountain melted, the body would reappear. When the date came, this team of mountain climbing companions went to the same location again to see if the prediction was accurate. On that day, the body of the youth did appear, lifelike, still as young as before, but looking back, everyone was already old. Everyone felt endless emotion. It is of course a pity that your son's ambition was unfulfilled and he died before his time, but we living friends will all grow old one day, and the impression of your son in everyone's mind will always be young, like that youth who accidentally fell into the deep valley." I don't know if this simple story can be considered a small comfort to these two old people. However, this story has always had a wonderful appeal to me personally.</p>

<p>— Hong Dao</p>
<p>(3) From "Knowing Everything" to "Knowing Nothing at All"</p>
<p>It is said that a few years ago, a certain university in China once circulated these few sentences about college students: "Freshmen Know Everything, Sophomores Know Something, Juniors are love-makers, and Seniors Know Nothing." To a considerable extent, these few sentences are quite enough to show the process of psychological change in young people in four years of university.</p>
<p>Why do freshmen "Know Everything"? Originally, high school graduates who have just entered university often become arrogant and look down on everything. They feel that after graduating from high school, they know almost everything. Now that they have stepped into the door of the highest institution, they feel even more energetic and extraordinary. They don't know that the knowledge in the world is infinite, and the treasure of knowledge is endless. They little know that the knowledge they have obtained is only a drop in the ocean. They don't fully understand the university curriculum, and they haven't given proper value to university education. They take the teachings of the professors as a passing breeze, and cannot use a humble heart to accept the knowledge and experience of the sages and great thinkers of ancient and modern China and foreign countries. They have to go through a lot of setbacks before they can feel their own ignorance.</p>
<p>Sophomores have received considerable lessons, and they know that the erroneous view of thinking that they "Know Everything" in the freshman era is extremely naive and ridiculous. But they are still a little conceited, and still feel that they "Know Something". They have to wait until the patient professors enlighten them and point out the ocean of knowledge to them before they will suddenly realize that they are not very great. At this time, they are willing to lower their heads and humbly accept education.</p>
<p>In the third year of university, they feel that they have completed half of the university journey, and the graduation date is not far away. The qualifications of college students are already quite old. They feel that it is time to talk about love. Under the control of this idea, they began to work hard to pursue the opposite sex, and talking about love became their most important "extracurricular activity". During this period, they floated in pink dreams and temporarily left their studies behind.</p>
<p>Seniors are gradually maturing in their thinking, and have a relatively correct understanding of the breadth of the field of knowledge. The more they learn, the more they feel their knowledge is shallow. "Learn and then know the inadequacy" is really true. At the same time, because the graduation period is approaching, they begin to think about the issue of outlets. They have more contact with society, and only then do they realize that the knowledge they have obtained is really insufficient to meet the needs of their occupation. At this time, they regret that they did not concentrate on their studies in the past years. At this time, they know that four years of university only give them some basic professional knowledge, learning methods, and preliminary training in skills. As for wanting to cope with everything in society and hoping to be competent and happy in their occupation, they still have to go through a lot of self-cultivation, and still need their own continued efforts. Under this awareness, they will naturally feel the "Knowing Nothing at All" of hesitation. In fact, they are not "Knowing Nothing at All". Knowing that they are "ignorant" is the beginning of true knowledge. Because a person knows that their knowledge is shallow, they can be humble and constantly pursue advanced knowledge. It can be said that from "Knowing Everything" to "Knowing Nothing at All" is an important lesson that college students have learned from four years of university education.

<h3 id="e75">Night Dream – A New Theory <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Ni</p>
<p>Let me tell you, last night, I weaved a dream. My heart was melancholic, and my dream became melancholic too.</p>
<p>It’s not that I like dreams, but dreams often invade me. In the past, I’ve woven all sorts of different dreams. When I was happy, I enjoyed them; but when I was melancholic, I was tormented, and the intensity in the dream exceeded reality.</p>
<p>Therefore, I have even more sorrow. And you? Aren't we all immersed in a sea of sorrow? Such an unbearable burden.</p>
<p>How can we untie the knots in our hearts? If the world has an apocalypse, then destruction will bring an end.</p>
<p>You might say that's too cruel. Is that really the only way out?</p>
<p>No matter what, I am unwilling to accept that. We have crossed forests and valleys, and we have been submerged beneath the waves of the sea of life. You say it was such a laborious and weary journey. There were also moments of joy, but sorrow accumulated along with the weariness.</p>
<p>We grope vaguely in the darkness. How piercing and delightful it is to see the light after being accustomed to the darkness; but falling from the light into the darkness blurs the eyes. I cannot see clearly the pain expressed on your face, and you cannot either, can you? Oh, melancholic dream!</p>
<p>Even the longest night comes to an end, a melancholic dream won’t last forever, right?</p>

<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(7) Swift Thunder</p>
<p>Sure enough, Second Madam Ye opened the door from the west room and came over, opening doors and calling out along the way, "Wei Cheng, who's making those strange noises? Huh! Wei Cheng's room is dark, is he asleep? It's getting late, it's time to sleep." Then she heard Second Madam Ye close the door and go to bed. Wei Cheng only hoped that his aunt wouldn't understand that it was him calling out, completely disregarding that this was also deceiving his aunt.</p>
<p>Cui Zhen, it must be said, was a thoughtful person. In the Shuangmei Study, she witnessed Wei Cheng's exclamation and change of color, and she thought that something was unusual about the matter. Although she told Second Madam Ye, and although Wei Cheng had concealed things in front of Second Madam Ye, she still could not dispel her doubts. The next day, Second Madam Ye told Cui Zhen, "It was very strange last night. In my sleep, I heard Wei Cheng shouting. I opened the door to look, and the lights in Wei Cheng's room were out. Today, I asked Wei Cheng, and he said he hadn't shouted at all. I asked Magpie, He Ma, and A Xing, and they all said they heard someone shouting." Cui Zhen said, "I heard it too, but I live in the back, so I didn't hear it clearly." After Cui Zhen said this, her doubts deepened, and she paid close attention to Wei Cheng's actions everywhere.</p>
<p>Wei Cheng and Cui Zhen engaged in a battle of wits, with Cui Zhen paying attention everywhere and Wei Cheng being on guard everywhere. If he encountered Cui Zhen around him, he would try his best to pretend to be calm. He would laugh along with them when they laughed. Only when he was in his own bedroom, in front of the portraits of his parents in the Shuangmei Study, would he either be sad or angry, always clenching his fists tightly, often digging his fingernails into his palms, digging very deeply. When he turned around and saw that no one was there, he would let out a long sigh. One day, he sighed again, and Cui Zhen walked in from outside and said, "Brother Cheng, don't hide it from me. These past few days, your smile hasn't been natural, and when you're alone, you're always sighing. Tell me, is there anything you can't tell your aunt, that you can tell me? I may be a woman, but I can walk, and I'm no weaker than A Xing. Tell me, I want to share some of your worries." When Wei Cheng saw Cui Zhen, he smiled and said, "Sister Cui Zhen, you're going to be busy again over nothing. Last time, you said I was eating too little, which made everyone at home uneasy. This time, you suspect I have something on my mind, but in fact, I still don't have anything. Sister Cui Zhen, thank you for your kindness, but your kindness is wasted." Cui Zhen said, "No! You must have something on your mind, otherwise, no young man would sigh every day." (135)</p>
