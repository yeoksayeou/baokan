<p>今夏酷熱之久長為近三十年所僅見以致霍亂流行死亡相繼入秋以來涼暖失時瀉痢又復猖獗據宋大仁醫師談怎樣防治瀉痢至有見地茲摘錄如次</p>
<p>查瀉痢一癥共分六種即腸炎性瀉痢細菌性赤痢變形蟲性赤痢消化困難性下痢蓄便性下痢補經性下痢是也</p>
<p>治病以識病為先欲求識病非借助儀器不為功古時之治療疾病也以限於環境之束縛僅這視聽口頭之問對知其下痢之色赤者乃曰病屬血分下痢之色白者乃曰病屬氣分色現多種者乃曰五色痢時作時止者乃曰休息痢飲食不進者乃曰噤口痢孰為瀉熟為痢僅視乎臨便時之爽利與否以為斷其於病之真際固皆冥然罔覺以未有儀器之輔助有必然者矣更有所謂暴病屬熱久病屬寒之論殊不知暴與久寒與熱初無一定之界說則我人將何以信從耶病之輕淺者雖勿藥有效然於病之沉重者危險立見矣惟其不明病之真際雖至死而不司其所以然是以枉死者多且皆諉之天命醫亦不任其咎深堪浩嘆是以不得不以科學方法解決之科學方法維何亦曰分病因之種類是也</p>
<p>六種瀉痢以後列三種瀉痢均為慢性而非傳染者與時間無關且其癥象多不甚嚴重例如體重之無甚變化腹部之不感壓痛等至於腸炎性瀉痢細菌或變形蟲性瀉痢則其初起時略現全身癥象如乏力頭暈悶脹等繼則大便漸覺疝痛遂現裹爭後重　以及黏液性血便大便次數一盡間自數次乃至數十次不等共成分不外黏液血液濃汁等此三種瀉痢之癥象往往　同不易區別而以細菌性瀉痢為最嚴重變形蟲性瀉痢易轉為慢性腸炎則有腸氣充滿復部膨滿雷鳴等癥象而無血液一般而論僅藉癥象往往不能獲得正確之診斷須將其大使加以一般之鏡檢或培養則何者為腸炎何者為細菌性下痢何者為變形蟲性瀉痢無不瞭如指掌矣</p>
<p>痢疾為一危險之傳染病但無積極之預防法故僅可愼於飲食以為預防若知附近有痢疾發現應立即報告衛生處已患痢疾應即延醫診治而鑑別其為何種痢疾有正確之診斷後再加以合宜之治療最後須提及者則痊愈以後應檢查糞便無細菌及變形蟲之存在以斷菌類遺留體內而使痢疾不免發生也尚有疫痢一病專發生於小兒朝發夕死甚形危急病理與療法與成人各癥逈異不可不愼</p>

<p>— 袁鷹</p>
<p>二十幾年以前魯迅先生就已大聲疾呼過救救孩子</p>
<p>可是在二十年後的今日我們依然可以很容易很普遍地看到無數的失學的流浪兒這龐大的難以數計的數目和坐包車上學的小少爺們比起來誰都不知道相差有多少倍了</p>
<p>這是一年不可否認的事實上海在幾年來除了增加了一半的人口以外也增加了更多的貧兒街頭巷尾垃圾桶旁隨時隨地都可以看到這一羣羣蓬頭赤腳的孩子們當然他們也同樣地是社會國家未來的主人翁更同樣地急切地需要良好的教育然而我們的社會對於他們的是遺棄斥逐是不屑的鄙視而神聖的學校裹更是決不容許這羣小瘍三們充斥其間的那兒是坐包車的小少爺們的世界</p>
<p>這對於我們的另一羣未來主人翁是如何的冷酷啊他們的求知人呢並不減於別人他們的天才是更並非不駟庸材相反地他們中間正有著無數的希望我們不是知道愛迪生高爾基司蒂芬生以及古今中外一切的偉大人物大半都是由貧兒出身的麼</p>
<p>然而生活的高潮緊緊地壓迫著他們他們希望讀書但他們也要吃飯在飯都不容易吃得到的今日他們所需要的不是化錢的學校</p>
<p>而上海的義務學校卻少得可憐了這也並非上海沒有慈善人士（我們天天可以在報上看到用很大的鉛字登出來的大善士們）可是人們在為生活終日工作以後誰還有時間再做這義務教育的工作呢一句話自顧尚且不暇</p>
<p>因此我們的學校揚光義務夜校就這樣的誕生了因為我們都還是做學生的時候沒有繁重的負擔也沒有辛苦的工作有的是晚上一部份的空時間和體力我們願意而且應該以這些力量再還給社會還給國家還給人類</p>
<p>關於經費是由每人向親友捐募來的由於每個從的成績的美滿我們更相信正還有許許多多的熱心的同情我們的慈善人士在這更加了我們的勇氣鼓舞起我們的信心我們並不要出風頭也不需要一文的薪水我們一致的希望只是有些微貢於社會國家人類於萬一而已</p>
<p>雖然這路是艱苦的工作也是困難的不少的親友們都和我們說過我們自己也很清楚可是為了救救孩子我們只有含辛茹苦地掮起這艱難的擔子同情會增加我們的勇氣希望更會堅定我們勝利的信心在正義底偉大的召喚裹我們將獻出一切的力量為了人類</p>
<p>（我們的學校是設在靜安寺路海格路西聯吉里七號學雜費完全免收供給書籍開學日期是九月二十八日時間五時至七時半班次自小學一年級至六年級我們竭力願意住在附近的貧兒們在很快的時間內實現了他們讀書的希望）（酬移助學金）</p>

<p>— 蔭</p>
<p>今年的月色也許要使你感到黯然的如果眞是黯然的話那在中秋的前夜地球上的烽火波動到月球時嫦娥小姐的情緒浸沉在矛盾苦悶中一面在恐戄著生活將感受許多多的變動一面則又在想藉一個機會到新的世界去活動考慮又考慮的最後終於悄悄飛出月宮無目的地任意降臨到什麼地方</p>
<p>女人的性情到底怕煩燥的當她飛過有一陣歌舞昇平的音樂正在熱情秦彈著的一角隅——上海仿佛具有推動力地嫦娥小姐降落了</p>
<p>在當夜嫦娥小姐的美麗的容顏婀娜的身段給一羣中秋不到就在預祝中秋節的納士們包圍了噴香的甜美的香檳酒迷戀了嫦娥小姐的眼眸子不知不覺忘記自已的尊嚴忘記自己的使命跟著瘋人一般地也滾進在輕狂的旋渦中</p>
<p>人此月球中失去嫦娥黯然了</p>
<p>假定有人發現今年的月色還是一模樣Ｐ那麼嫦娥正打從你身邊在微笑呢</p>

<p>— 沉靜</p>
<p>不錯在珠玉業市場裹混飯吃的人到今日都會產生不堪回首話當年之慨的且慢以二三十年前的興旺情況作比較即就近五六年來而言也莫不掏頭嘆息今非昔比</p>
<p>衰盛莫不有其濳在的原因珠玉業的衰落原因眾多姑述一二於後</p>
<p>㈠貨價的高昂五六年前的貨物均已十倍十五倍或三十倍其值使中產者也打消佩戴珠鑽的念頭顧客打折頭㈡市面的不寗過去平靖時代稍有積貯即購佩飾物以充場面現在不同百業時興波瀾大家都改變念頭盡以積貯投擲於四積投機乘機獲利珠鑽不再問津矣</p>
<p>㈢存貨的匱乏即偶有暴發戶的太太奶奶廣搜珠鑽欲一光門楣然貨物已如上海的外產影片來路早已中斷市上各貨均係次貨買者找不到恰如其意的貨物</p>
<p>㈣也即是最主要的要輪到珠玉興盛百業已興盛於先百業稍一呆滯珠玉業立即了完全停頓所謂先溫飽後富貴</p>
<p>在上述四點之外尚有一個更主要的致命傷就是試想珠玉鑽石既不如香煙等怕潮濕也不如毛巾布疋等怕漏水而又並不如飾金等較五六年前之市價高五六十倍同樣是商品為什麼有囤香煙囤毛巾布疋而沒有囤輕易命題的珠玉鑽石同樣是飾金為什麼購買者願取其貴而捨其較賤者一句話珠玉業根本沒有公開的劃一的正式的價格當購買者的時候往往高抬虛價至離本二三倍亦有同樣脫售時則又一往往煞窮鬼因之失去了商業上的信用而每況愈下了</p>
<p>目前前輩先生也打破了子繼父業的觀念也知道了本業衰敗的不可挽救幼輩承襲父業已很少很少了</p>
<p>然而這富貴行業的珠玉市場卻還是擁滿著衣衫敝舊的人羣他們喧嚷爭執無異在飢餓線上掙扎如果有暇上時代劇場去觀光觀光那種窮兇極惡的神情是夠人吃驚和傷心的</p>

<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>The Japanese return-visit mission, consisting of three special envoys, Baron Hiranuma, Mr. Arita, and Mr. Nagai, arrived in Nanjing on the 22nd with their entire entourage. They were warmly welcomed by both the government and the public in our country. They have been extremely busy with banquets from high-ranking Chinese and Japanese officials for several days. Despite their busy schedule, Special Envoy Hiranuma and his entourage, all in formal attire, accompanied by Ambassador Shigemitsu and others, took a car to the foot of Purple Mountain at 9:00 AM on the 24th to reverently visit Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum. The Chinese and Japanese military police maintained strict security along the way. After the car arrived at the mausoleum park, they were greeted by Xu, the Chief of the Protocol Section of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and alighted. They were greeted by Xiao, the Director of the Bureau of Ceremonies of the Military Affairs Department, in front of the mausoleum and led inside the mausoleum hall to perform a bow. The entire group performed three bows in front of the incense table. Special Envoy Hiranuma then presented a wreath and paid respects to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's portrait. The ceremony was solemn and respectful. After the ceremony, Director Xiao led the special envoys and others around the mausoleum for a week, admiring the remains. Afterwards, they returned to the original place and the whole party bowed before leaving the mausoleum hall. They lingered on the steps, gazing at the distant scenery, surrounded by lush green pines and ancient trees for dozens of minutes. The entire group took photos for remembrance. Special Envoy Hiranuma and others were then accompanied by Director Xiao to inspect the troops at the military academy.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Special Envoy Hiranuma and his party respectfully visited Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum at 9:00 AM on the 24th and after paying their respects, they rushed to the Central Military Academy at 10:15 AM. As the car arrived at the school gate, music played loudly. Special Envoy Hiranuma and his party alighted and were led into the VIP room by Secretary-General He and Education Director Liu of the school to rest briefly. At 10:30 AM, a military parade was held on the large parade ground. Chairman Chu of the Reception Committee, Director Xiao of the Bureau of Ceremonies, and other military and political officials of the National Government, as well as over a hundred representatives from friendly nations, including Lieutenant General Kawabe, Lieutenant General Matsui, Major General Noda, Major General Harada, Major General Teraoka, Major General Daitani, Ambassador Shigemitsu, Minister Higaki, Ambassador Lu Ronghuan, Consul General Deji, and representatives from the Italian Embassy, proceeded to the large parade ground amidst the military music and ascended the reviewing stand in single file. First, the Parade Commander-in-Chief, Bao Wenwei, reported on the inspection officials. Then, the march-past began. The officers in the ranks were full of spirit and marched in orderly steps. The special envoys expressed their admiration after inspecting them.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>After the military parade, the special envoys immediately watched a performance of new national exercises on the parade ground of the military academy. 1,500 students from national, municipal, and private middle schools in the city participated in the exercises. After all the students stood at attention and saluted, student representatives presented flowers to the three special envoys, Hiranuma and others. The three special envoys personally accepted the flowers and nodded with smiles. Then the performance began, divided into six sections. The movements were gentle and uniform, all in circular patterns. All the students performed with agile and gentle movements, full of spirit and vigor.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>President Wang's reply at Ambassador Shigemitsu Kui's banquet on the evening of the 23rd: I am most grateful for Ambassador Shigemitsu's sincere speech. Recalling my visit to your country last June, I was deeply moved and will never forget the gracious courtesy extended by His Majesty the Emperor. The concern and grand plans of the government officials and the enthusiastic expressions of the people from all walks of life have added boundless courage to my vision of the future of cooperation between the two countries and the co-prosperity of East Asia. This time, I am honored to have the specially appointed envoys, Baron Hiranuma, Mr. Arita, and Mr. Nagai, come from afar to return the visit. I was pleased to learn this morning of His Majesty the Emperor's good health. I have read the Imperial Rescript, which is earnest and sincere. The establishment of a new order in East Asia based on righteousness is a contribution to world peace. It is the glory of East Asia and the virtue of the world. Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the loyalty and bravery of your country's army and navy soldiers, and the united efforts of the entire nation, have truly borne the burden of this lofty and great mission. Although our country is determined to share joys and sorrows, our capabilities are weak, and I am deeply afraid that we will not be able to provide much assistance. We can only strive to improve ourselves and do our best to share this hardship with your country, so that we can reap the same sweetness in the future. This is what I sincerely wish to convey. Three years ago, when Baron Hiranuma was Prime Minister, I traveled from Hanoi to Tokyo and had the opportunity to meet him. At that time, Baron Hiranuma said to me that the results of the last European war produced the League of Nations, which was full of utilitarianism, leading to misdirection and repeated disputes. Until today, the phenomenon of infighting persists. China and Japan should reverse this trend and rely on the Eastern spirit of righteousness to reunite. Baron Hiranuma made this grand proposal when the current European war had not yet occurred, and his foresight and insight into the root causes are truly admirable. At the same time, I also met Mr. Arita when he was Minister of Foreign Affairs and discussed that he had wanted to eliminate the Incident before it occurred when he was Ambassador to our country a year before the Incident, but unfortunately our country's government failed to understand, resulting in regret. I met Mr. Nagai in Tianjin twelve years ago and discussed the general trend of East Asia and the relationship between China and Japan, deeply concerned about planning ahead. Today, I am reunited with the three of you, recalling the past and feeling deeply moved. The other members of the mission are also eminent figures in your country's court, whom I have long admired. I am delighted to meet you today and hope to learn much from you during these precious few days, so as to enlighten my journey. I deeply believe that the friendship between our two countries will be further strengthened because of the arrival of these three special envoys, and the overall situation in East Asia will be better and more effectively resolved because of this. Tonight, I am honored to receive the generous hospitality of Ambassador Shigemitsu. I have a word to offer to comfort the special envoys and the members of the mission. For more than two years, the colleagues of the National Government and the staff of this embassy, including Ambassador Shigemitsu, and the commanders-in-chief, including General Hata, have been consulting with each other frankly and honestly, based on our beliefs and speaking directly, without any estrangement. Because we are working together as comrades in East Asia, we can do this. I would like to take this opportunity to raise the host's glass and wish Baron Hiranuma, Mr. Arita, and Mr. Nagai, and all of you, good health, and to wish the victory of the Greater East Asia War and the success of the construction of a new order in East Asia based on righteousness.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Soviet Ships Mobilized on the Volga River, Street Fighting in Stalingrad, Ruins Provide Convenience to the Soviets, German Advance Feels Unusually Difficult <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 24th (Havas)</p>
<p>Soviet military authorities yesterday mobilized the Volga River gunboat flotilla for the first time to participate in the defense of Stalingrad, bombarding German-Romanian positions. It is claimed that eight enemy artillery positions were destroyed. At the same time, intense street fighting continues in the Stalingrad city area, with both sides deploying reinforcements. However, the battle situation is chaotic. All that is known is that German forces have occupied several more streets in the south of the city, while Soviet forces have recaptured several streets in the north. The defending forces in that area launched a counterattack, reportedly repelling the Germans. City residents have been mobilized to strengthen defenses to cope with new offensives. The German side now admits that attacking Stalingrad will require considerable time and significant sacrifices.</p>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>Street fighting continues in Stalingrad. The ruins of the city provide great convenience to the Soviet forces, making the German advance extremely difficult. However, German forces made further progress in the city area yesterday and cleared out the Soviet forces in the occupied areas. In the north of the city, German forces also repelled a strong Soviet attack. Air battles over Stalingrad have been incessant. German aircraft shot down 37 Soviet aircraft yesterday without any losses. German pressure on Grozny has increased. After occupying Vila Dimirov, Taileke, and Daskojie, the German forces repelled repeated Soviet counterattacks. Fighting is taking place in the plains and mountainous areas. On the Caucasus front, German forces are operating along the railway leading to Kasbek northeast of Osonikis. Soviet forces in the Voronezh area have launched attacks with tanks, artillery, and aircraft but have not succeeded. On the central sector of the Eastern Front, German forces launched a fierce counterattack and reached their destination. Soviet forces in the area of Rzhev, after receiving reinforcements, continued their attacks yesterday. Soviet forces have failed to break through the German lines in any area. The Soviet forces that had penetrated the German lines were repelled. Flat-trajectory artillery units are most active in the Rzhev area.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 23rd (Havas)</p>
<p>Today marks the 458th day of the German-Soviet war. The fighting in the Stalingrad city area has stabilized, with only concentrated bombing by the German Air Force. In the past few days, the opposing sides were engaged in close combat, making it impossible to deploy aircraft for bombing. However, German dive bombers resumed their attacks yesterday, striking a power plant in the northern suburbs of the city. Two battalions of the Red Army and one battalion of female soldiers were defending the position. The power plant was destroyed, reportedly killing at least 1,000 defenders. It is reported that German forces have occupied the city's General Post Office, but the Red Army continues to hold its original position in the strategic area near the Gorky Sanatorium, unshaken, though it is constantly subjected to artillery bombardment by German forces. On the Caucasus front, German forces continue to make progress. It is reported that German armored units have reached 30 miles south of the Terek River and are approaching the railway center, which is the junction of the railways leading to Grozny and Ordzhonikidze. Military observers say that Ordzhonikidze is the center of the Red Army's defenses in the Caucasus region and the key to accessing the passes of Mount Christoye. The German General Staff wants to attack the city from the rear, but the Red Army is resolutely resisting, with no signs of weakening. A large number of reinforcements have been transferred from Baku to reinforce the Red Army. The Red Army is utilizing the terrain to its advantage, so the German forces are taking precautions everywhere to avoid falling into ambushes.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 24th (Allied Press)</p>
<p>The Vichy government recently announced that Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar, has fallen, confirming British reports of the fall. At the same time, according to reports from London, British General Platt, the commander-in-chief of British forces in Madagascar, announced on the Antananarivo radio station that the British have established military administration in the city. The French translation of the announcement was read by a British staff officer, with the main points being: (1) Military jurisdiction is established in the city of Antananarivo; (2) The British Commander-in-Chief is responsible for maintaining order; (3) The British Commander-in-Chief supervises local administrative officials; (4) Designated crimes will be tried by military courts; (5) Local jurisdiction is suspended. In addition, the curfew remains in effect.</p>
<p>Vichy, 24th (Havas)</p>
<p>Governor-General Anet of Madagascar recently telegraphed the Colonial Minister reporting that Antananarivo, the capital of the island, has been lost, saying that our troops resisted to the city limits, but were unable to prevent the enemy from entering the city due to the disparity in numbers. The bravery of our troops will be forever etched in history. I have found no evidence of dereliction of duty by officials. Radio and telegraph operators were able to remain loyal to their duties. The people of the city were able to remain calm in the face of this event.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Allied Press)</p>
<p>According to informal sources here, British forces have occupied Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar. This news has not yet been confirmed by Vichy or London. The information was broadcast by the Antananarivo radio station last night during a music broadcast when a voice suddenly stated that a British officer reported that British forces had occupied the capital at 5:00 PM on Friday. Antananarivo is 90 miles from the east coast, with a population of approximately 70,000. It is located 5,000 feet above sea level and has a beautiful landscape. To the west is a fertile expanse of land. It was occupied by France on September 10, 1895, and became a French territory.</p>

<p>The second phase of the clearing the countryside in the southeastern Taihu Lake region is about to begin. To facilitate military command, the Countryside Clearing Committee has specially established a Security Command for the Countryside Clearing Region, appointing Chuan Shi to serve concurrently as Commander.

<p>The Soviet Ambassador and the British and American Ministers in Tehran held a lengthy meeting yesterday with the Iranian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. The King of Iran also received the Prime Minister in the afternoon. Political circles in Tehran believe that the Allied powers have brought Iranian participation in the war to its highest degree. Although the Kavani government is unlikely to declare war immediately, it has had to make the greatest concessions under diplomatic pressure. Kavani recently sent letters to provincial authorities urging them to maintain close cooperation with the occupying forces.</p>

<p>Washington, 24th (Havas)</p>
<p>The House of Representatives last night passed President Roosevelt's Inflation Prevention Act by a vote of 284 to 96. The bill includes an amendment on agricultural product prices, stipulating a 5% increase in selling prices.</p>
<p>Washington, 23rd (Havas)</p>
<p>The House of Representatives today passed a bill proposed by the Agriculture Committee by a vote of 163 to 105, stipulating that production costs should be included in the price ceiling for agricultural products. This is a major victory for the farmers' faction over the government. After the implementation of this measure, the selling price of agricultural products will be 10% to 12% higher than the government expected. As a result, the national treasury will increase its expenditure by 300 million to 350 million U.S. dollars each year.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Ambassador Nomura Speaks <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Former Ambassador to the United States, Mr. Kichisaburo Nomura, who recently returned to Japan from the United States, is currently resting in his hometown. He recently told a reporter from the Allied Press that if the United States prepares for war with a five-year plan, Japan will definitely complete the Greater East Asia War with a strength of more than ten years. At present, the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere has become an established fact, and there is no room for third-country interference. The United States, which advocates Pan-Americanism and rejects third-country interference in the Western Hemisphere, still denies the great unity of the East Asian nations, which is even more unreasonable. However, I believe that the understanding of the new order in East Asia by Britain, the United States, and other countries around the world, or its recognition, is only a matter of time. Today, all the nations of Asia have discovered new ideals and hopes because of the Greater East Asia War, and are thereby cooperating in the construction of Asia for Asians.</p>

<p>Santiago, Chile, 24th (Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>Uruguayan Foreign Minister Guini told reporters that the American republics should abide by the resolutions of the Rio de Janeiro Pan-American Conference. Although Chile and Argentina are non-belligerent nations, their attitude should be the same as that of Uruguay in 1917. This attitude was decided by the foreign ministers of the American republics at a meeting in Rio de Janeiro. The ideal of the League of Nations was the foundation for lasting peace, but it failed because of the unequal rights of the member states. Therefore, the formation of an alliance between the American nations is also impossible.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Times reports that a certain official of the Municipal Council recently stated that since all major crimes in the Public Concession have been eliminated, the Police Department is now dedicated to eliminating minor crimes such as pickpocketing, robbery, and theft of bicycles. Before the outbreak of the Pacific War, major criminals and petty thieves were rampant in Shanghai, with endless cases of crime, and assassinations and kidnappings occurred daily. The public was not safe, but today is different from the past. Criminals can hardly escape the police's net, and are arrested and imprisoned every time they commit a crime. Therefore, other criminals have</p>
<h3 id="e16">Disappeared <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Daring not to move. Shanghai, which was known as the Chicago of the East, is no longer seeing major crimes. Those who used to hire bodyguards for self-defense can now rest assured that they will not be kidnapped. The only thing that still makes Shanghai residents unhappy today is petty theft. However, if the methods currently implemented by the police are effective, this unhappiness will not last long. The police are now rounding up vagrants and vagabonds, investigating their fingerprints, and conducting thorough interrogations. The police have also repeatedly urged the public to report cases of pickpocketing and bicycle theft, as the police can</p>

<p>Minor crimes upon receiving reports. The public must provide assistance to the police. Taking pickpockets as an example, the police already know the names of many pickpockets and their activity locations. The police have also established new regulations requiring the presentation of identification when buying, selling, or pawning bicycles. This law has greatly reduced bicycle thefts, but cooperation from the public is still hoped for. If there are any thefts, immediately report the location of the theft and other details.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the Mid-Autumn Festival settlement day for all industries. After the joint preparation committee of banks and the Central Reserve Bank made every effort to regulate the stability of interbank finance in the market, the banks and financial institutions provided accommodation to companies, factories, and businesses for their dues on the autumn festival, as their own foundations became more sufficient. At the same time, the old debts released by various industries were able to be recovered by nineteen percent due to the market improvements. Therefore, they have all safely passed this settlement day. As for the financial market, there are no special tensions in accordance with the stable money supply. Regarding the reorganization or closure of some small money shops and banks, after the authorities took effective measures to crack down on them in the speculative market, these speculative money shops and banks could no longer use their skills, and reorganization and closure were the appropriate phenomena, which were unrelated to the overall financial situation. Yesterday, all banks, financial institutions, and civil factories and businesses closed in accordance with regulations. The resumption of business will be today, and all bills and receipts during the holiday period will be handled today.</p>

<p>Authoritative sources point out that the food situation in the city has returned to stability from turmoil, as there has been no shortage of food supply for the population. The source of food rice has long been completely organized and distributed by the highest authorities in the city, and the allocation matters are coordinated by the Food Office of the Municipal Council. In the future, food rice will continue to be shipped to Shanghai from the rice-producing areas of Central China for the market, and citizens are already accustomed to using miscellaneous grains and flour as daily supplementary food, so the rationing of food will not be insufficient. It is reported that since the implementation of rationing on July 6th, the two concessions have distributed a total of eleven installments totaling approximately 390,000 shi of whole rice and broken rice, totaling 310,000 bags, of which the Public Concession accounted for 250,000 shi or 200,000 bags, and the French Concession accounted for 140,000 shi or 110,000 bags. From the 21st of this month, the household ration will be distributed three times a month. If each person is given two liters of rice each time, the consumption of food rice in the two concessions will be 140,000 shi or more than 110,000 bags.</p>

<p>After the designation of seven model areas for air defense light control exercises in the Public Concession area, all preparations for air defense control are proceeding at a high speed. The Old Zhabei Police Station also notified the Lianbao chiefs of the district a few days ago to strictly pay attention to the lighting of shops, stating that in order to strictly control the lights, all electric lights and advertising lights outside the shops have already been announced to be extinguished. All electric lights in each household must be fitted with black cloth lampshades and black cloth curtains or covered with black paper before the 25th of this month. If there are still violations of the control, severe punishment will be imposed without leniency. Please forward the instructions to your subordinates to comply. In addition, the Lianbao chiefs of Old Zhabei notified the Jia chiefs and household heads that the authorities have issued repeated orders for the implementation of light control, and while many residents in the bao have complied with the methods, there are still some who have not complied and are waiting to see. As this matter concerns important air defense matters, we are hereby issuing a notice again, urging the residents of this bao to purchase them as soon as possible before the 25th of this month and not to delay any further, lest they incur punishment.</p>

<h3 id="e25">Former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Fessenden, Encounters Trouble on a Bus; Mr. Fessenden Files a Complaint with the French Consulate Against the French Tram Company; The Case is Scheduled to be Heard by Judge Corbin Early Next Month <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>According to the English-language "North China Daily News," reliable sources report that Mr. Fessenden, former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, recently encountered a dispute on a public bus in the French Concession when he attempted to use a damaged Central Reserve Bank note to pay his fare, which the ticket seller refused. Private mediation proved ineffective, and Mr. Fessenden has now filed a lawsuit with the French Consular Court against the French Tram and Electric Light Company, claiming inconvenience and mental distress. He is demanding an apology and compensation for emotional damages, though the amount of compensation sought is minimal, as his intention is to set a precedent. It is reported that the case is scheduled to be heard by Judge Corbin early next month. The incident occurred when Mr. Fessenden boarded the bus and attempted to pay with a damaged one-yuan Central Reserve Bank note, which the ticket seller refused to accept. Mr. Fessenden insisted, and the bus came to a halt. The conductor asked all passengers to transfer to another bus, leaving only Mr. Fessenden behind. Subsequently, police were summoned and Mr. Fessenden was taken to the McClellan Police Station, where he was released immediately upon being identified as the former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>

<p>According to the English-language "North China Daily News," it has been announced that the British and American Community Associations in Shanghai, in accordance with recently promulgated regulations from the Japanese authorities, will begin issuing armbands to British and American residents starting on Saturday and Sunday, respectively. The armbands will cost three yuan each and are required for all enemy nationals aged thirteen and above. All applicants should apply in person at the British and American Community Associations and present their passports or consular registration certificates. There has been no announcement yet from other foreign communities in Shanghai, whose countries are at war with Japan or have severed diplomatic relations, regarding the issuance of armbands.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Application Period for Student Meal Subsidies Extended by Two Days <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The student meal subsidy campaign initiated by the Shanghai YMCA and YWCA began on the 17th of this month. Over the past few days, the number of applicants has been extremely high, with the majority having received scholarships from the Shen Bao and Xin Bao newspapers or free tuition from schools at the beginning of the semester. Due to living alone in Shanghai or scheduling constraints, they have experienced great difficulty managing their meals independently. The application deadline was originally set for yesterday, but in response to requests from many students, it has been extended for two more days. The urgent need for meal relief for impoverished students is evident, and the associations' limited financial resources mean that the completion of this relief effort depends entirely on the generous donations of caring people in society. It is sincerely hoped that all sectors of society will strive to contribute.</p>
<h3 id="e28">How to Prevent and Treat Dysentery <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>The prolonged heat of this summer is the most severe in nearly thirty years, leading to a cholera epidemic and successive deaths. Since the arrival of autumn, the weather has been erratic, and dysentery is once again rampant. Dr. Song Daren's insights on how to prevent and treat dysentery are particularly insightful. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>Dysentery is divided into six types: enteritis dysentery, bacterial dysentery, amoebic dysentery, digestive difficulty dysentery, constipation dysentery, and tonic deficiency dysentery.</p>
<p>To treat a disease, one must first understand it, and to understand it, one must rely on instruments. In ancient times, the treatment of diseases was limited by the constraints of the environment. Only visual and auditory questioning was used to determine that the color of the diarrhea was red, indicating a blood disorder, or white, indicating a Qi disorder. If the color was varied, it was called five-color dysentery; if it occurred intermittently, it was called recurrent dysentery; and if food could not be ingested, it was called silent dysentery. Whether it was diarrhea or dysentery was determined solely by the smoothness of the bowel movement. The true nature of the disease remained unknown due to the lack of instrumental assistance. Furthermore, the theory that sudden illnesses are due to heat and chronic illnesses are due to cold is untenable, as there is no fixed boundary between sudden and chronic, or between cold and heat. How can we trust such theories? Mild illnesses may heal without medication, but severe illnesses pose immediate danger. Because the true nature of the disease is not understood, many die without knowing the cause, attributing it to fate, and doctors are not held accountable. This is deeply regrettable. Therefore, it is necessary to solve the problem with scientific methods, which means classifying the types of causes.</p>
<p>Of the six types of dysentery, the latter three are chronic, non-contagious, unrelated to time, and their symptoms are not severe, such as minimal weight change and no abdominal tenderness. As for enteritis dysentery, bacterial dysentery, or amoebic dysentery, their initial onset is accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fatigue, dizziness, and bloating. Subsequently, the stool gradually becomes painful, and then there is tenesmus and mucoid bloody stools, with the number of bowel movements ranging from several to dozens of times a day. The components are nothing more than mucus, blood, and pus. The symptoms of these three types of dysentery are often similar and difficult to distinguish. Bacterial dysentery is the most serious, while amoebic dysentery easily turns into chronic enteritis, which is characterized by intestinal gas, abdominal distension, and rumbling, but without blood. Generally speaking, relying solely on symptoms often fails to obtain a correct diagnosis. It is necessary to perform a general microscopic examination or culture of the stool to clearly identify whether it is enteritis, bacterial dysentery, or amoebic dysentery.</p>
<p>Dysentery is a dangerous infectious disease, but there is no active preventive method. Therefore, one can only be careful about diet for prevention. If dysentery is found nearby, it should be reported to the health department immediately. If one has dysentery, one should seek medical treatment immediately to identify the type of dysentery. After a correct diagnosis, appropriate treatment should be administered. Finally, it must be mentioned that after recovery, the stool should be tested to ensure that no bacteria or amoebas remain to prevent the recurrence of dysentery. There is also a type of dysentery called epidemic dysentery, which occurs exclusively in children and is rapidly fatal. The pathology and treatment differ greatly from those of adults, so caution must be exercised.</p>

The school originally had three departments: textile, dyeing and chemistry, and machinery, and admitted junior high school graduates for a five-year course of study. Now, in view of the need to increase cotton production by developing water conservancy, a special water conservancy engineering class has been added, and high school graduates and those with equivalent qualifications are admitted for a three-year course of study. Enrollment has already begun, and the regulations are on file. Classes are scheduled to begin around Double Ten Day.</p>

<h3 id="e35">Saving the Children - Introducing Yang Guang Volunteer Night School <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan Ying</p>
<p>More than twenty years ago, Mr. Lu Xun had already loudly appealed to save the children.</p>
<p>But even today, twenty years later, we can still easily and commonly see countless out-of-school and homeless children. Compared with the young masters who go to school in chauffeur-driven cars, no one knows how many times greater this huge, uncountable number is.</p>
<p>This is an undeniable fact of the year. In addition to adding half of its population, Shanghai has also increased its number of poor children. Groups of unkempt, barefoot children can be seen everywhere in the streets and alleys, next to garbage bins. Of course, they are also the masters of the future of society and the country, and they also urgently need good education. However, our society abandons and rejects them, and disdains and despises them. The sacred schools even refuse to allow this group of little beggars to enter. That is the world of the young masters who ride in chauffeur-driven cars.</p>
<p>How cold this is to our other future masters. Their desire for knowledge is no less than that of others, and their talents are by no means mediocre. On the contrary, there are countless hopes among them. Don't we know that most of the great figures of the past and present, both Chinese and foreign, such as Edison, Gorky, Stevenson, all came from poor backgrounds?</p>
<p>However, the high tide of life is pressing them tightly. They want to study, but they also need to eat. In these times when it is not easy to get food, what they need is not a school that costs money.</p>
<p>And there are too few free schools in Shanghai. It is not that there are no charitable people in Shanghai (we can see the great benefactors who are published in large fonts in the newspapers every day), but after working all day for a living, who still has time to do this volunteer education work? In a word, they are too busy taking care of themselves.</p>
<p>Therefore, our school, Yang Guang Volunteer Night School, was born. Because we are still students, we do not have heavy burdens or hard work. What we have is some free time and energy in the evening. We are willing and should use these forces to give back to society, to give back to the country, and to give back to humanity.</p>
<p>The funds come from donations raised by each person from friends and relatives. Because of the satisfactory performance of each donation, we are more convinced that there are still many enthusiastic charitable people who sympathize with us. This has further increased our courage and encouraged our confidence. We don't want to show off, nor do we need a penny of salary. Our unanimous hope is only to make some contribution to society, the country, and humanity, even if it is only one in ten thousand.</p>
<p>Although this road is hard work and difficult, many friends and relatives have told us, and we ourselves are very clear. But in order to save the children, we can only bear the hardships and carry this difficult burden. Sympathy will increase our courage, and hope will strengthen our confidence in victory. In the great call of justice, we will dedicate all our strength for humanity.</p>
<p>(Our school is located at No. 7, Xilianjili, Haig Road, Jing'an Temple Road. Tuition and fees are completely free, and books are provided. The school opening date is September 28, and the time is from 5:00 to 7:30 PM. Classes range from the first grade of elementary school to the sixth grade. We are willing to do our best to help the poor children living nearby realize their hope of studying in a short time.) (In return for the scholarship)</p>

<p>— Yin</p>
<p>This year's moonlight may make you feel黯然(dispirited). If it is really黯然(dispirited), then on the eve of the Mid-Autumn Festival, when the flames of war on Earth spread to the Moon, Miss Chang'e's emotions were immersed in contradiction and depression. On one hand, she was terrified that life would experience many changes, and on the other hand, she wanted to take the opportunity to go to a new world to operate. After considering again and again, she finally quietly flew out of the Lunar Palace and landed randomly and aimlessly in some place.</p>
<p>A woman's nature is ultimately afraid of烦燥(annoyance). As she flew over a corner where there was a burst of prosperous song and dance music——Shanghai seemed to have a driving force, and Miss Chang'e landed.</p>
<p>On that night, Miss Chang'e's beautiful face and graceful figure were surrounded by a group of men who were celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival before it even arrived. The fragrant and sweet champagne bewitched Miss Chang'e's eyes, and she unconsciously forgot her dignity and forgot her mission, and like a madman, she also rolled into the whirlwind of frivolity.</p>
<p>Humanity in the lunar world has lost Chang'e and has become黯然(dispirited).</p>
<p>Assuming that someone finds that this year's moonlight is still the same, then Chang'e is smiling by your side.</p>

<h3 id="e38">The Ever-Deteriorating Pearl and Jade Industry <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Jing</p>
<p>Indeed, those who make a living in the pearl and jade industry today will sigh with emotion when they talk about the past. Even if we don't compare it with the booming situation of twenty or thirty years ago, we can't help but sigh at the decline in recent years.</p>
<p>Prosperity and decline both have underlying reasons. There are many reasons for the decline of the pearl and jade industry. Let me mention one or two:</p>
<p>(1) The high price of goods. The value of goods from five or six years ago has increased by ten, fifteen, or thirty times, causing even the middle class to give up the idea of wearing pearls and diamonds. Customers want discounts. (2) The instability of the market. In the past, in peaceful times, people with a little savings would buy accessories to fill the scene. Now it is different. Many industries are experiencing turbulence. Everyone has changed their minds and is using their savings to invest in speculation, taking the opportunity to profit. Pearls and diamonds are no longer asked about.</p>
<p>(3) The scarcity of inventory. Even if there are occasional nouveau riche wives and grandmothers who widely search for pearls and diamonds, wanting to bring glory to their family, the goods are like foreign films in Shanghai. The source of supply has long been interrupted. The goods on the market are all inferior. Buyers cannot find goods that are satisfactory to them.</p>
<p>(4) The most important thing is that the pearl and jade industry can only prosper when all industries are prospering first. If all industries stagnate, the pearl and jade industry will immediately come to a complete standstill. As the saying goes, "First comes warmth and fullness, then comes wealth and nobility."</p>
<p>In addition to the above four points, there is an even more fatal wound. Think about it, pearls and diamonds are neither as afraid of moisture as cigarettes, nor as afraid of water leakage as towels and cloth, and they are not as expensive as gold ornaments, which are fifty or sixty times more expensive than they were five or six years ago. Why do people hoard cigarettes and towels and cloth, but not pearls and diamonds, which are easy to hoard? Why do buyers prefer to buy expensive gold ornaments and abandon cheaper ones? In a word, the pearl and jade industry has no public, unified, and formal price. When buyers buy, they often raise the price by two or three times the cost. When they sell, they often bleed dry the poor devils, thus losing commercial credit and deteriorating.</p>
<p>At present, senior gentlemen have also broken the concept of sons inheriting their fathers' business and have also realized that the decline of the industry is irreparable. There are very few young people who inherit their fathers' business.</p>
<p>However, this wealthy industry's pearl and jade market is still full of people in ragged clothes. They are clamoring and arguing, as if struggling on the hunger line. If you have time to visit the Times Theater, you will be shocked and saddened by the ferocious expressions.</p>

<p>(9) Hell on Earth</p>
<p>Cui Zhen knew that she was Wei Yunqing's daughter, bit her lower lip, glared at her, and did not answer her words. The woman went out. There was a sound of footsteps outside, and the people guarding the door hurriedly stepped aside. Wei Shaoyun and his gang came in. His head was wrapped in a piece of blue cloth, there were drops of blood on the collar of his suit, and there were two deep black marks on both sides of his pants legs. This time, he was not as obsequious as before. He straightened his chest, inserted both hands into his waist, and shouted, "Who told you to sit there grandiosely? Get up for me! "Cui Zhen said, "It's none of your business." Wei Shaoyun said to his followers, "Take her down. The young master is here, and you don't know Mount Tai. What the hell is she?" The followers pulled Cui Zhen down. Wei Shaoyun said, "Kneel down for me. I knelt to you just now, and now it's your turn to kneel to me. Kneel!" Cui Zhen said, "You knelt because you were willing to. Why should I kneel to you?" One of his followers winked at Wei Shaoyun, and Wei Shaoyun shouted, "Kneel or not? I'll beat you!" As soon as Wei Shaoyun's words came out of his mouth, Cui Zhen felt someone grab her ear, someone press down on her leg, and a blow on her back. Her eyes blurred. She knelt down. Wei Shaoyun said, "Bian Cuizhen, you, you knelt to me! What do you want to ask of me? If you speak nicely, I, Young Master Wei, may not hold you accountable." Cui Zhen spat a mouthful of saliva, but did not hit Wei Shaoyun's face. Wei Shaoyun's anger rose again and said, "Rope! Rope!" The followers were only worried that Wei Shaoyun would not order them to do it. They thought it was an opportunity to avenge the young master and immediately took out thick and thin ropes to tie up Cui Zhen's hands and feet. (186)</p>
