<p>瑞士京城二十日哈瓦斯社電　聯合報頃載有駐倫敦訪員來電稱、英國與論界對於英國海陸空三軍之不能通力合作、參謀部與陸海空三軍、生產勞工部、暨其他政府機關之缺少聯絡、時加指摘、英國政府爰於一昨發表、「白皮書」加以駁斥、並說明帝國參謀部之組織、大意略謂、英國海陸空三軍之間、組有合作委員會、由總參謀長勃魯克爵士担任主席、首相兼國防大臣邱吉爾、倘因事不克出席會議、則由伊斯美將軍為代表、至於參謀部之仟務、最重要者有二、第一係就有關作戰之各項問題、隨時向政府提供意見、第二為支配所屬各機關、從事各項工作、海陸空三軍參謀長之下、均設有副參謀長一員、以資襄助、各項問題在理論上原應全體內閣會議作為最後決定、但在事實上、則由戰時內閣決定、戰時內閣閣員除副相阿特里少校、外相艾登、生產部大臣李特爾頓三人而外、尙有海軍陸軍航空三部大臣、英國輿論界向以政府與參謀部缺少聯絡為言、按之事實完全不確、遠在一九三二年改組陸海空三軍軍令部、以免重陷上次大戰覆轍時、政府即已與參謀部合作無間、並設立作戰計劃局、受總參謀長之部制、外務部、計割執行局、暨未來作戰局、均有代表參加在內、在各部會之間均派有聯絡員、此外、尙有軍事偵察小組委員會之設、其下分派兩處、其一為敵人作戰計劃硏究處、其二為情報交換處、與總司令部所屬各機關、均保有直接關係、至於內閣與參謀部之間互通情報、則由參謀部聯絡員與首相公署秘書負責辦理云、</p>

<p>里斯本二十一日同盟社電　據路透社得封港電、英前陸相倍利厦、昨在此間發表演說、力言應從速展開第二戰綫、渠以為援助蘇聯、為當前之急務、略謂吾人不可將蘇聯抗戰實力、作過大之評價、現在蘇聯國民所最關心者、為第二戰綫之展開是也、今德軍勢如怒濤、向束挺進、直趨蘇聯心臟地區、蘇軍作戰澀滯、乃為當然之事、吾人苟完成展開第二戰綫、則聯軍可於最近期間獲得勝利、吾人須知、漠視由最近作戰所得之敎訓、徒事派遺軍隊往歐洲大陸、實為最危險之舉、時至今日、吾人應從速予蘇聯以軍事上之援助、否則吾人將何以履行諾言耶、今日實為吾人猛炸德國—業及交通綫之最好良機、英美兩國在外交政策上向乏連繫、倘聯合國仍不設法加强政策之統一、則敵人必將在軍事及外交上、利用吾人之弱點、加以更大之襲擊矣、</p>
<p>倫敦二十日哈瓦斯社電　英國勞工界領袖之一波爾登、本日在電氣業工會集會中發表演說、主張立即開闢第二戰塲、略謂蘇聯軍隊所受壓迫、日見車大、吾人不禁欲問對於援助紅軍、究竟有無充分準備、良以英蘇兩國均知開闢第二戰塲、乃係當務之急、且深知此一戰塲、必須於本年內開闢、但按之實際、國內準備情形之過緩遲延、殊難令人滿意也、以言戰後世界組織問題、預料大戰結束之後、世界改觀、人類對於現行制度、定必感覺不滿、勢將耍求澈底改革、屆時專以尋求市塲為事之資本主義、自不應再容其繼續支配人類運命云、</p>
<p>華盛頓二十日哈瓦斯社電　關於開闢第二戰塲一事、若干星期之前即在德軍在里比亞及烏克蘭邦發動攻勢之前、美國人士大半認為此說屬於理想、協約國軍隊欲於最短期內侵入歐洲大陸、在物質上殆為不可能事、但至此際、蘇聯戰局日趨嚴重、美國軍事專家深以紅軍崩潰為憂、乃改變中張、認為開闢第二戰塲不僅必要、抑且刻不容綏、惟仍認為其中最重要之問題厥為運輸工作、俾能以各項必需品供給侵入歐陸之美國遠征軍、過去據專家估計、美軍二百萬員名、平均以每名需要商船十五噸計算、則運輸軍用品前往歐陸供給美軍、當需要商船三千萬噸、此則協約國在大西洋方面實無如許商船可資調動、故當時立下斷語、直認侵入歐陸為小可能事、惟至最近估計、士兵每名需要商船十五噸之估計、乃以所有遠征軍悉由美國自行供給為根據、實則按之事實並不盡然、一俟英國各大兵工廠能以其軍械彈藥供給軍隊之後、遠征軍之軍需品即不必盡自美國運往聞最近數月來、已在加緊製造軍械、俾他日能供給美軍之需要、加以所儲藏之炸彈砲彈子彈等為數甚鉅、足敷發動未來攻勢之用、此外華盛頓及紐約各報對於邱吉爾首相以某相要職、畀予皮佛勃魯兇動爵一訊、均認為意義重大、料與協約國於本年內在歐陸發動攻勢有關、捷克總統貝奈斯最近向捷克飛行員發表演說、含義亦極重要、揣其目的、顯在使美國人民均具有必須派遣史多之美軍前往歐洲之觀念云、</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十一日海通社電　據瑞典報紙倫敦通訊稱、建立第二戰綫問題、尙為英國方面討論之題目、倫敦政府方面確認英美之實力、已足夠發動此項攻勢、但同時承認航務情形尙難滿意、英國報紙不但認第二戰綫之建立、為絕對必要之事、並登載英國及北愛爾蘭之美國軍隊現正從事於侵犯歐洲大陸之訓練、其中並包括傘兵之訓練、以滑翔機數白架登陸之情形、據「晚報」倫敦通訊稱、英國人民要求立即建立第二戰綫者日益增加、惟尙有少數人民恐建立第二戰綫之嘗試、將引起悲慘之結果、但此類人民僅佔少數云、</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十一日海通社電　此間報載倫敦訪員電訊稱、英美兩國關於開闢第二戰塲之討論、尙無結果、但多數人巳了解德國非封鎖或空襲所能戰敗、欲圖擊敗德國、非向歐陸進攻不可、但航船運輸問題、使英美當局感覺艱於應付、英報如孟却斯德導報等主張積極援蘇之呼聲極高、惟邱吉爾與羅斯福兩人尙未有何決議、究竟葫蘆中所賣何藥、尙難臆斷也、</p>
<p>德義冷嘲熱諷視為紙上空談</p>
<p>瑞士京城二十日哈瓦期社電　沮利希日報今晨柏林電稱、開闢第二戰塲之說、雖甚囂塵上、但實際上不過紙上空談而已、協約國商船倘依照目下被擊沉數量、長此下去、結果所屆、將無一個鐵甲師及其配備能通過大西洋、况第二戰塲目的、應為挽回蘇聯南部戰局、此際援助蘇聯為時已過遲、紅軍已遭遇致命的危險、無人可以否認云、又日內瓦講壇報羅馬電、義大利政界以為英國財閥、實為阻礙開闢第二戰塲者、故此事遲遲不能實現、並非全屬不得巳、倫敦與華盛頓兩方雖作種種聲明、但蘇聯控制歐洲大陸、實非英美兩國之利、且德軍在蘇聯進展異常順利、第二戰塲一旦開闢、徒使蘇聯加速消耗、與英國財閥之初衷當相符合云、</p>
<p>三軸心國合作自信勝劵可操</p>
<p>柏林廿一日哈瓦斯社電　軍略家梅茲將軍、頃在此間無綫電台談論「軍略與政略」、略謂日本參戰以後、三大軸心國軍略的合作、巳成為必不可少之事、日本之攻擊阿留申翠島德軍當局絕不等閑視之、蓋蘇聯從此不能經由海參崴港獲得接濟矣、惟論及作戰方略時、政治行動與軍事行動同共重要、截至目下為止、德義日三國政治見解一致、曾使戰事進展完全順利、假令政治上發生歧異、軍事耶將突然惡化、使軸心國大感不利、要之軸心國軍略及戰時政治行動、將臻完善之境、最後勝利將愈有把握云、</p>

<p>阿根廷京城二十一日海通社電　阿根廷內閣咋日下午舉行會議、由總統卡斯蒂洛博士生席、所討論之主要問題、為阿根廷之油給及僱用商船運輸事、政界認此次閣議與現在西班牙商務代表團所進行之談判有關、開內閣將於今日繼續開會、</p>
<p>智利駐美大使米契爾今返國</p>
<p>智利京城二十日哈瓦斯社電　頃據外交部宣布、智利駐美大使米契爾定於後日自任所返國、大使在任克盡　職、極為里沃斯總統所嘉許、同時、智利在軍事財政及經濟上之各項需要、亦賴該大使之迭次說明、而為美國政府所洞悉、總之、政府現行政策、係以總統本年五月間所發有關美洲大陸聯繫性之宣言為依歸、</p>
<h3>駛菲軍火船　被德擊沉</h3>
<p>柏林二十一日海通社電　德元首行營發表特別文吿稱、德潛艇在人西洋中亞索斯之北襲擊運載軍火赴菲之護航船隊、擊沉敵船七艘、內有運載軍火之大船一艘、共三萬八千噸、德潛艇一艘駛入聖勞倫斯河、擊沉敵船三艘、共一萬五千噸、另有一輪被魚當擊中受創、（四千五百噸）另有敵船六艘共五萬一千噸、在美國領水內擊沉、另有敵貨船一艘、被魚雷擊中、受重創、最近四日內德潛艇擊沉敵船十六艘、共十萬四千噸、</p>

<p>兩租界中共八十起至於兩租界發現虎疫則在南市第一次發現後數日、其患者為臥於法租界馬路之盲丐、旋被扛入醫院中逝世、近來某村郊亦發現六起、因此引起防疫工作之積極辦理、在過去一星期中、公共租界亦發現虎疫案多起、據謂兩租界中已被確切證實霍亂患者共達八十人、其餘則均發生於華界、據法租界衛生處某職員吿泰晤士報記者、謂兩租界之霍亂症蔓延、或可較華界為遲緩、因第一由於兩租界水量供給之適當、第二則住居於華界者之居民、多不注意飲水之須保持衛生、以致霍亂菌易為侵入、衛生處父向居民發出聲重警吿、亟望市民從速注射二次防疫針、調如其不未雨綢繆、則本年霍亂案之發現、將極易超過去年九百起之數日、</p>

<p>改裝電機添設開關</p>
<p>能與閘北直接電話之電話機、與普通之話機在形式上略有不同、根據電話公司工程部之設計、即在電話機上添裝一種開關式撳鈕、欲與閘北通話時、須將此開關按下、即可免除往常通話須由〇二一轉接之麻煩、此種開關之設置、事前難免有種種手續上之準備、且以目下所需之材料短缺、不能大量裝配、</p>
<p>蘇州河北首先實行</p>
<p>電話公司為試行起見、擬首在蘇州河北區域將普通電機改作能與閘北直接通話之用、因以上兩區相距甚近、易於辦理、但亦並非普通改裝、電話公司當於事前查閱記錄、選擇共中往常與閘北通話次數較多之用戶、將其話機改裝、凡母需與閘北時常通話之用戶、縱聲請改裝實機、勢遭拒絕、如以後直接通話先後推及租界其他區域、亦循此原則進行、</p>
<p>直接通話收費不變</p>
<p>租界與閘北間之直接通話、每次取費三角、與先撥○一」由接綫生轉接之情形相同、以示公允、又關於電話公司拒絕新裝電話、據稱實因話機缺乏、各項材料、幾全斷擋、但電話　移地點、祇要在同一區　內號碼毋須改變之情形下、電話公司自當從速辦理、如　移至另一區域、因無異在該區域新裝一電話、在手續上日期上難免延宕云、</p>

<h3>枕畔收聽播音記</h3>
<p>— 慕蓉</p>
<p>譚氏父子於本月十六日合作羣英會於故都長安戲院，電台並轉播，余收聽後作此記，以供諸同好。初聽時，巳演至子翼公瑾酒醉臥入帳中。富英班中丑角，本爲慈瑞泉，或茹富憲，慈老歿後，以孫盛武瓜代，此次孫盛武赴滬，而是晚茹富憲亦未帥蔣幹，以馬富祿代之，不知何故。富綠唱做之隨便，盡人皆知，盜書之念白，如囫圇呑棗，所佳者，嗓音響亮耳。妙香之周瑜，嗓不若　盛闡動聽，說白本音太多，恐係衷氣不足之故。劉硯亭之黃蓋甚佳，嗓子沙，有些錢金福味兒行苦肉計時，要詐降那曹營的營字，以鼻音出，博得滿堂杉聲。及後，命闞澤至曹營下書時之大段念白，斬釘截鐵，尤足爲後輩取法。富英之魯肅尙佳，草船借箭時原板平穩，這般時候之時候二字，較所灌之唱片慢而圓。末傷孔明借風，唱腔新穎花巧，不在連良之下，以數九天少東風以下叫句最佳，純以低腔川，動聽之至。小培之前孔明，老鍊穩熟，甚於富英，惜乎年邁氣衰，與妙香同病。最佳者，魯肅道川二人手中均爲火字後之笑，三人分淸得有交代，小培之冷而譏，妙香之恨而懼，富英夕戇而直，純爲天性之流露，黑白分明，賓主分淸。打黃蓋後，周瑜見孔明痴坐飲酒，知此計又為此道人所知，怒而拔劍欲斬之，鑼鼓長錘起，想見此時丈人峯怒容滿面，欲斬老親家，累得佳婿一旁打躬作揖，値得一笑也。楊盛春之趙雲，嗓不及高盛麟響亮。其他王泉奎曹操，宋繼亭闞澤等，均平平。南北通隔，聞此佳音，聊解一渴也。</p>
<h3>訪舞台藝人　夏霞創作「寡婦院」</h3>
<p>— 嵐影</p>
<p>夏霞除了有一身佳妙動人的演技以外，她還有一枝善於寫作的筆，去年年底，她曾完成一本關於婦女問題的劇作，叫做「寡婦院」，將在最近公演，因此我們的談話，就從「寡婦院」開始：</p>
<p>『聽說夏女士的「寡婦院」就快上演了。』</p>
<p>『是的，快了，這幾天正在找着獻演的傷子呢。飾演的人大多數都是觀衆們所熟悉的，我自已或許也是其中之一——這段「寡婦院」的劇情，在我腦子裏　經盤旋了不知道多少年了——』她對於這劇本懷有很大的信心。她認眞地把這個故事如何發喘，如何影響她，以至終如何寫成，如何預備公演的經過情形，很詳細地從頭說了一遍，這經過情形，她說，在「寡婦院」的序文中，她將作一番川色的介紹，終是在這裹我樂得省去一筆。後來她還吿訴我她爲了要出版「寡婦院一，曾經想了整侵，原來她雖有印書的心願，却找不着印書的本錢！結果她得到</p>
<p>價可能　辦法：向觀衆們借貨，等書出版俊，以書或現余加利　逻，她自信這楚可以實現的。至終事　上究竟成功不成功且不在話卜，她的精神該稱可嘉！</p>
<p>「以飾你也曾福過劇本嗎？」</p>
<p>『是的，不過有好些祇寫了一半就丟了，有的又有點七零八落，是我一向不曾着竟整理牠們，不能拿出來見人。」</p>
<p>「以後你又願意做些那一類的工作呢？」</p>
<p>『總不外乎編戲，演戲，導演戲……』她日樣子似乎以「戲」爲至上，爲了戲，甚至於可以犧牲一切似的。</p>
<p>「哎——然而，也許，結果却做了一個專管家務的賢妻良母！』我很抱歉，若楚說這樣的話是不應該　。</p>
<p>當時她很自然地笑道·『不會的叫我這樣做的機遇固然不在少數，然而，至少在目前，我最喜歡戲，我想我不會離來戲的。」</p>
<p>她半時最喜歡看電影。在她演過的許多戲中，她最喜歡「妙峰山」。</p>
<p>至於她的技藝已經是每一個人都知道的舉。如今我們盼望能够早些見到她的處女作的公演。</p>
<h3>李麗華出嫁之謠</h3>
<p>— 汪俊</p>
<p>外間傳說跡近滑稽</p>
<p>近來盛傳李麗華與京劇名伶紀玉良相戀，並有綸及娶嫁之設，筆者爲明瞭眞相計，特赴李麗華之寓所專訪，據麗傘本人談。『我與紀玉良根本祇是極普通的朋友，他是我母親的同事，自然和我是認識的，至於有人設我常和他出入咖啡館等各交際傷所，眞楚豈有此理，現在更說我將下嫁紀玉良，根本是信口雌簧。」</p>
<p>時李母張少泉亦在家，據伊語筆者·「我會將我女兒嫁給已有老婆和小孩的紀玉良，眞是從那裹說起？我不懂他們爲什麼要造護言。而且現在紀玉良早已户离滬，更可證明這謠言之無稽。」</p>
<p>筆者又曾詢及：「關於麗華大戲院，李小姐有無關係」。據彼言：「根本無關係，該院經理李飾玉君，與我亦不相識。</p>
<p>李麗華才新作有「秋」及「寒山夜雨」二部，分別在中聯總廠和三廠工作，終日奔波，忙碌異常，根本談不到其他。</p>
<h3>游藝雜寫</h3>
<p>— 良玉</p>
<p>上海年靑的票界裏，旦行新發現了兩顆彗星，一個是良社裹的倪澄波，專攻靑衣，嗓子甚衝。另一個，便是最近進黃金正式下海的那位虞琪玫，虞近來拜王蘭芳爲師，專攻花衫，據票界中人說，虞琪玫的巧笑倩顰，戎伯銘後，一人而已。他的蹺工，吾未見過，那一天去二進宮裏的皇娘，力竭聲嘶，我代他揑一把汗，以後這類不對功的戲，還是少唱爲妙。</p>
<p>張哲生君的銅錘花翻，除說白稍差外，竟能與王泉奎相伯仲，（鼻音的使用無王泉奎的從心所欲，而嗓音的寬闊，有過之而無不及）票界名小生楊定熙君初語我，謂張君　嗓，一度甚暗，近始稍復，宜於短劇，而不勝繁　云云，近聆其二　宮，不謂厥嗓大佳，自始至終，無懈可擊，乃知盛名之下，無虛　焉。</p>
<p>孫景璐近進綠寳劇塲，所有配角，還是璇宮時代的老人馬，聲約暑天的關係，又因產後，孫女士的容顏消瘦了，嗓子也稍爲輕微些，無論在模樣上，說白上，演技上，在現在說起來，有叫不才妙，四不楚啥？不肥，不瘦，不瘟，不火，而綠寳太師椅的寬暢舒適，也値得一提的。</p>
<p>金素雯有繼孫景瑯　綠寳說，但金二姐的個性，叫她演「日出」一類的戲，恐怕不十分對勁，爲生意眼着想，那外子胡梯維先生，最好替她編幾幕「啼笑姻　玩玩，穿揮一幕大鼓調，說不定會引人入勝哩。逸香</p>
<h3>CZC娛樂事業公司成立</h3>
<p>— 逸得</p>
<p>包括話劇，歌舞，歌劇，音樂，木偶戲——</p>
<p>在娛樂事業發達的國家，差不多都是大規模的公司投資，像美國的大都市裏，遭種娛樂事業公司楚很多的。一方面是幫同娛樂事業的發展，另一方面可以使游藝節目精益求精的逐漸改進。</p>
<p>近幾年來上海的游藝界呈現很蓬勃的現象，但都是小規模的僩別發展，從來沒有人願意化鉅大資木投資於娛樂事業，作範圍較大的經營，因爲不像做投機事業那樣本輕利重，現在，却有一個關終遊藝界裏很興奮的消息，就是最近成立的CZC娛樂事業公司，預備化很大的資本，替滬上游藝界創一番新面目。</p>
<p>CZC公司包括五部份：話劇，歌舞，歌劇，音樂及木偶戲等，集中全滬最優秀的演員，網羅中外著名的游藝界人材，用合作的方法演出，CZC公司負責管理各部份，經常在本市著名的戲院上演。</p>
<p>現在，木偶戲是首先上演，這是與猶太人高天倫合作的。話劇部份也將在匕月底或八月初假本市有冷氣設備的某大戲院公演，全滬弟一流的編導人才部參加，演員中巳經有夏霞，籃蘭，芷君，梅邨，高洋，天然等數十人。其餘西人負責的歌劇，歌舞，音樂等也都分別進行中，該公司決定化最大的人力物力，使娛樂事業能够在較充裕的經濟條件卜，有一個很高尙和正常的發展。</p>

<h3>Japanese Navy Landing Force Continues Eastward Advance Towards Panshih, Japanese Army Attacks Northwest of Kueiteh</h3>
<p>Panshih, 21st (Domei News Agency) - The Japanese Naval Landing Force, which landed in T'u a few days ago, is currently pursuing scattered soldiers five kilometers east of here in Yangtien Village and Hsiayangtien Village at the mouth of the Ou River, and has captured two 8mm high-angle guns.</p>
<p>Wenchow, 21st (Domei News Agency) - After the mine-sweeping operation from the mouth of the Ou River to this port was completed, the commander of a certain unit of the Japanese Naval Landing Force arrived here via waterway from Panshihwei at 2:50 PM today. The commander of the Japanese Army unit here welcomed him at the pier.</p>
<p>Kaifeng, 21st (Domei News Agency) - It has been disclosed that the Japanese Army launched a strong attack on Saturday, striking 3,000 Communist troops about 32 kilometers northwest of Kueiteh in northeastern Honan Province. The Japanese army left behind 400 corpses and abandoned their rifles and other equipment. It is reported that this army was originally gathered near Tingtao, 64 kilometers north of Kueiteh, preparing to move to southern Hopeh.</p>
<h3>New Zealand Prime Minister Visits Australian Authorities</h3>
<p>Discusses Pacific War Situation, Moresby Bombed Again</p>
<p>Saigon, 21st (Haitong News Agency) - According to news from Sydney, New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser, accompanied by U.S. Ambassador Hurley, visited Australia to discuss the Pacific war situation and Lend-Lease issues with Australian authorities. He told reporters that it would be a serious mistake to underestimate the importance of the war against Japan.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Domei News Agency) - According to news from Melbourne, General Macworth's headquarters announced that Japanese planes bombed Port Moresby yesterday.</p>
<p>Sydney City's Centennial Anniversary</p>
<p>Sydney Harbor, Australia, 20th (Havas News Agency) - Today marks the centennial anniversary of the founding of Sydney. The city government held a celebration, and Prime Minister Curtin attended. He read a congratulatory telegram from King George VI of England on the spot. The city has a population of one million, making it the second largest European-populated city in the British Empire.</p>
<h3>Bulgarian Envoy to Japan Appointed</h3>
<p>Sofia, 21st (Haitong News Agency) - According to newspapers, after Bulgaria established its embassy in Japan, the newly appointed ambassador to Japan, Bayev, led the embassy staff to Japan and has now arrived in Kubyshev, from where they will proceed to their post via Siberia.</p>
<h3>Negotiation Process of the Japanese-Vietnamese Economic Agreement</h3>
<p>Saigon, 21st (Domei News Agency) - After the signing of the Japanese-Vietnamese Economic Agreement, Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux met with reporters, explaining the negotiation process and purpose of the agreement. He frankly admitted that the Vietnamese economy, after the cessation of trade with mainland France, would be difficult to sustain without trade with Japan. He stated that the economic agreement was signed based on the 1941 Tokyo Agreement, and he deeply believed that through this agreement, they could obtain the raw materials necessary to maintain their industry. He was pleased that the representatives of Japan and Vietnam signed this agreement in a spirit of mutual understanding and cooperation. He further stated that Vietnam is still a young country in terms of economy, exporting raw materials and agricultural products, and importing manufactured goods and industrial chemicals. The Vietnamese economy depends on this. He noted that Vietnam's overseas exports were mainly to mainland France before the war, with goods shipped to France accounting for 65% of total exports. After the outbreak of the war, trade between Vietnam and mainland France was cut off. Goods could not be exported, and the materials needed could not be obtained. Even if efforts were made to produce substitutes to address the urgent situation, the Vietnamese economy was extremely difficult due to isolation from overseas. Fortunately, with the signing of this economic agreement with Japan, Vietnam can export its products and import necessary materials. Vietnam's exports to Japan are, in principle, rice, corn, and minerals, while Japan's exports to Vietnam are industrial products and textiles.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Haitong News Agency) - According to the "Yomiuri Shimbun," France's permission for Japanese troops to enter Vietnam suggests a change in France's East Asia policy. However, this measure only avoided disputes between Japan and Vietnam. The signing of the new Japanese-Vietnamese trade agreement clearly reflects the changing situation in East Asia. Japanese Prime Minister Tojo hopes that all countries will cooperate with Japan, and Japan is prepared to provide assistance if Vietnam cooperates with Japan. Japan will respect Vietnam's sovereignty and territorial integrity and hopes that Vietnam will also adopt a cooperative attitude on issues such as the development of raw materials and the reform of indigenous education.</p>
<h3>Indian Hindus and Muslims Seek Cooperation</h3>
<p>Zurich, 19th (Domei News Agency) - According to a United Press report from Wardha, the Indian National Congress, in view of past Hindu-Muslim cooperation in India being obstructed and constrained by Britain, is pursuing Hindu-Muslim cooperation in order to withdraw British forces from India. However, London is well aware that the impact would be extremely alarming if Gandhi's proposal were implemented. Furthermore, as stated in Speaker Acharya's recent statement, the Muslim League must maintain benevolent neutrality if the Congress launches an anti-British independence struggle. Although the number of participants was not specified, it is well known that a considerable number of Muslims will participate in the anti-British movement, so the situation is considered serious. The Basel newspaper also described the British side's unease, stating that the British side may have a tendency to compromise with India, but the newspaper also represented the British government conversely, stating that if the war is affected by the anti-British movement, a decisive attitude will be taken towards Indian leaders.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Administration Trains Javanese Technicians</h3>
<p>Surabaya, 20th (Domei News Agency) - The military administration here believes that the various technicians among the natives, even if they have graduated from industrial schools here, are not suitable for Japanese industrial technology. In order to remedy this, it has been decided to establish a training institute for technicians here to meet the needs of various fields. It is reported that the institute is scheduled to open on August 1 and has already started enrolling students. It will be divided into drafting, machinery, engine, and civil engineering departments. The establishment of the institute will make a great contribution to the construction of New Java.</p>
<h3>British Government Publishes White Paper Explaining the Organization of the General Staff: Seamless Cooperation with the War Cabinet, Churchill Invites Beaverbrook to Join the Cabinet and Appoint Him Minister of Defense Coordination</h3>
<p>Zurich, Switzerland, 20th (Havas News Agency) - The United Daily News recently published a dispatch from a correspondent in London stating that the British media has been criticizing the British army, navy, and air force for failing to cooperate effectively, and the lack of communication between the General Staff and the army, navy, air force, production and labor departments, and other government agencies. The British government published a "White Paper" yesterday to refute these criticisms and explain the organization of the Imperial General Staff. The main points are as follows: a cooperation committee is formed between the British army, navy, and air force, chaired by Chief of the General Staff Sir Brooke. If Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Churchill is unable to attend meetings due to other commitments, General Ismay will be his representative. The two most important tasks of the General Staff are: first, to provide the government with advice on various issues related to operations at any time; and second, to supervise the various agencies under its jurisdiction in carrying out various tasks. Under the chiefs of staff of the army, navy, and air force, there is a deputy chief of staff to assist them. In theory, all issues should be finally decided by the entire cabinet meeting, but in fact, they are decided by the War Cabinet. In addition to Deputy Prime Minister Major Attlee, Foreign Secretary Eden, and Minister of Production Lyttleton, the War Cabinet also includes the ministers of the navy, army, and air force. The British media has been saying that there is a lack of communication between the government and the General Staff, which is completely inaccurate. As early as 1932, when the military commands of the army, navy, and air force were reorganized to avoid repeating the mistakes of the last war, the government cooperated closely with the General Staff and established an Operations Planning Bureau under the command of the Chief of the General Staff. Representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Planning and Execution Bureau, and the Future Operations Bureau also participated in the Operations Planning Bureau. Liaison officers were assigned between the various ministries. In addition, there was a Military Intelligence Subcommittee, which was divided into two sections: one for studying enemy operations plans and the other for exchanging information. It maintained direct relations with the various agencies under the General Command. As for the exchange of information between the Cabinet and the General Staff, it was handled by the liaison officer of the General Staff and the secretary of the Prime Minister's Office.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 21st (Haitong News Agency) - According to news from London, Lord Beaverbrook is discussing the issue of rejoining the War Cabinet with Churchill. He may be appointed Minister of Defense Coordination. Due to pressure from public opinion, Churchill has apparently decided to relinquish the concurrent position of Minister of Defense, and a person he trusts and can control will succeed him.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 21st (Haitong News Agency) - According to news from London, Churchill invited Beaverbrook to join the Cabinet, but Beaverbrook has not yet accepted. It is said that Beaverbrook's return to the Cabinet is closely related to the issue of the Second Front. Within the British Cabinet, Deputy Prime Minister Major Attlee and Minister of Labor Bevin oppose Beaverbrook's entry into the Cabinet. Minister Cripps takes a "neutral" attitude. Beaverbrook's newspaper, the "Daily Express," is calling for an election. The left wing also has the same demand, but the Conservative Party opposes wartime elections, believing that the Prime Minister and Cabinet members can resign, but the demand for holding elections cannot be accepted.</p>
<h3>U.S. Appoints Philip as Head of the Military Intelligence Office in England</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 20th (Domei News Agency) - According to news from New York, former U.S. Ambassador to Denmark, Philip, who arrived in London last week, will reside in the U.S. Embassy in London as Deputy Ambassador and head of the U.S. Strategic Office in London.</p>
<h3>U.S. Special Envoy Arrives in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 21st (Central News Agency) - According to news from Chongqing, the Chongqing authorities announced that U.S. Presidential Special Envoy Currie arrived in Chongqing via India at 5:00 PM on the 20th.</p>
<h3>A Chorus of Voices in Britain and the United States Calling for Aid to the Soviet Union: Demanding the Opening of a Second Front</h3>
<p>Washington, 21st (Havas News Agency) - One million union members in New York have jointly written to President Roosevelt today, demanding the opening of a Second Front in Europe, stating that this matter is not only of great importance to the safety of the Allied countries, but also has an impact on the security of the Americas.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Domei News Agency) - According to a Reuters report from a sealed port, former British Secretary of War Hore-Belisha gave a speech here yesterday, strongly advocating for the prompt opening of a Second Front. He believed that assisting the Soviet Union was the most urgent task at hand. He stated that we should not overestimate the Soviet Union's resistance strength. What the Soviet people are most concerned about now is the opening of the Second Front. Now that the German army is advancing like an angry tide, heading straight for the heart of the Soviet Union, it is only natural that the Soviet army's operations are sluggish. If we can complete the opening of the Second Front, the Allied forces can achieve victory in the near future. We must know that ignoring the lessons learned from recent operations and simply dispatching troops to the European continent is the most dangerous thing to do. Today, we should promptly provide the Soviet Union with military assistance, otherwise, how can we fulfill our promises? Today is the best opportunity for us to bomb Germany and its transportation lines. There has always been a lack of connection between the diplomatic policies of Britain and the United States. If the United Nations still does not find a way to strengthen the unification of policies, the enemy will surely take advantage of our weaknesses in military and diplomacy to launch greater attacks.</p>
<p>London, 20th (Havas News Agency) - Borden, one of the leaders of the British labor movement, gave a speech at a meeting of the Electrical Trades Union today, advocating for the immediate opening of a Second Front. He stated that the pressure on the Soviet army is increasing daily, and we cannot help but ask whether we are fully prepared to assist the Red Army. Both Britain and the Soviet Union know that the opening of the Second Front is the most urgent task and are well aware that this front must be opened this year. However, in practice, the slowness and delay in domestic preparations are hardly satisfactory. As for the issue of the post-war world organization, it is predicted that after the end of the war, the world will change, and people will definitely feel dissatisfied with the current system and will demand thorough reforms. At that time, capitalism, which is solely engaged in seeking markets, should no longer be allowed to continue to dominate the fate of mankind.</p>
<p>Washington, 20th (Havas News Agency) - Regarding the opening of the Second Front, several weeks ago, before the German army launched offensives in Libya and Ukraine, most Americans believed that this was an ideal scenario and that it was materially impossible for the Allied forces to invade the European continent in the shortest possible time. However, at this point, with the Soviet war situation becoming increasingly serious, American military experts are deeply concerned about the collapse of the Red Army, and they have changed their position, believing that the opening of the Second Front is not only necessary, but also brooks no delay. However, they still believe that the most important issue is transportation work, so that the American expeditionary force invading Europe can be supplied with all necessary goods. In the past, experts estimated that an average of 15 tons of merchant ships would be required per soldier for an American force of 2 million soldiers, which would require 30 million tons of merchant ships to transport military supplies to Europe and supply the American forces. The Allied countries did not have so many merchant ships available for deployment in the Atlantic, so it was concluded at the time that invading Europe was a small possibility. However, recent estimates that 15 tons of merchant ships are required per soldier are based on the assumption that all supplies for the expeditionary force are supplied by the United States itself, which is not entirely the case. Once the major British armaments factories are able to supply the army with their weapons and ammunition, the expeditionary force will no longer need to have all of its supplies shipped from the United States. In recent months, the production of weapons has been stepped up so that they can be supplied to the American army in the future. In addition, the stockpiles of bombs, shells, bullets, etc. are huge and sufficient for launching future offensives. In addition, reports in Washington and New York that Prime Minister Churchill has given Lord Beaverbrook an important ministerial post are considered to be of great significance, and it is expected that it is related to the Allied forces launching an offensive in Europe this year. The recent speech by Czech President Benes to Czech pilots is also extremely important, and its purpose is obviously to make the American people have the idea that it is necessary to send a large number of American troops to Europe.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 21st (Haitong News Agency) - According to a London dispatch in Swedish newspapers, the issue of establishing the Second Front is still a topic of discussion on the British side. The London government confirms that the strength of Britain and the United States is sufficient to launch this offensive, but at the same time admits that the shipping situation is still not satisfactory. British newspapers not only believe that the establishment of the Second Front is absolutely necessary but also report that the American troops in Britain and Northern Ireland are currently engaged in training for invading the European continent, including training for paratroopers. Hundreds of gliders are being used for landings. According to a London dispatch in the "Evening News," the number of people in Britain demanding the immediate establishment of the Second Front is increasing daily. However, there are still a small number of people who fear that the attempt to establish the Second Front will lead to tragic results, but these people account for only a small minority.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 21st (Haitong News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a correspondent in London published in the newspapers here, the discussions between Britain and the United States on the opening of the Second Front have not yet yielded results, but most people already understand that Germany cannot be defeated by blockade or air raids. To defeat Germany, it is necessary to invade the European continent, but the shipping and transportation issues make the British and American authorities feel difficult to cope with. British newspapers such as the Manchester Guardian advocate for actively aiding the Soviet Union with extremely high voices. However, Churchill and Roosevelt have not yet made any decisions. It is still difficult to predict what medicine they are selling in the gourd.</p>
<p>Germany and Italy Mock and Ridicule it as Empty Talk on Paper</p>
<p>Zurich, Switzerland, 20th (Havas News Agency) - The Zurich Daily News' Berlin dispatch this morning stated that although the talk of opening a Second Front is rampant, it is actually nothing more than empty talk on paper. If the Allied merchant ships continue to be sunk at the current rate, the result will be that not a single armored division and its equipment will be able to cross the Atlantic. Moreover, the purpose of the Second Front should be to save the Soviet southern front, but it is too late to assist the Soviet Union at this time. The Red Army has encountered fatal danger, which no one can deny. Furthermore, the Geneva Tribune's Rome dispatch stated that Italian political circles believe that British financial groups are actually hindering the opening of the Second Front, so this matter has been delayed for a long time, which is not entirely involuntary. Although London and Washington have made various statements, it is not in the interests of Britain and the United States for the Soviet Union to control the European continent, and the German army is progressing extremely smoothly in the Soviet Union. Once the Second Front is opened, it will only accelerate the Soviet Union's consumption, which is in line with the original intention of the British financial groups.</p>
<p>The Axis Powers are Confident of Victory Through Cooperation</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Havas News Agency) - General Metz, a strategist, recently discussed "Military Strategy and Political Strategy" on the radio here, stating that since Japan's entry into the war, the strategic cooperation of the three major Axis powers has become indispensable. The German authorities will never take Japan's attack on the Aleutian Islands lightly, because the Soviet Union can no longer receive supplies through the port of Vladivostok. However, when discussing operational strategies, political action and military action are equally important. Up to now, the consensus of political views among Germany, Italy, and Japan has allowed the war to progress completely smoothly. If political differences arise, military affairs will suddenly deteriorate, which will be greatly detrimental to the Axis powers. In short, the Axis powers' military strategy and wartime political action will reach a perfect state, and final victory will be more assured.</p>
<h3>Heart Surgery Successfully Performed</h3>
<p>The Divine Skill of an American Doctor</p>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Domei News Agency) - Performing open-heart surgery is the most difficult, and there are few precedents in medical history. According to news from New York, a 17-year-old American wartime worker was stabbed in the heart. A surgeon removed three ribs for him, sutured the heart in seven places, and then transfused fluid from the heart chamber into the patient's arm vein, saving his life. This is hailed as a divine skill.</p>
<h3>Argentina's Foreign Policy Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 21st (Haitong News Agency) - After Argentina's Congress secretly debated international issues, Foreign Minister Guinaussu told reporters that Argentina's foreign policy remains unchanged. There were no proposals to sever diplomatic relations with the Axis countries during the debate. Argentina's foreign policy line has been determined and is unwavering.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 21st (Haitong News Agency) - The Argentine cabinet held a meeting yesterday afternoon, chaired by President Dr. Castillo. The main issues discussed were Argentina's oil supply and the employment of merchant ships for transportation. Political circles believe that this cabinet meeting is related to the negotiations currently being conducted by the Spanish commercial delegation. The cabinet will continue to meet today.</p>
<p>Chilean Ambassador to the U.S. Mitchell Returns Home Today</p>
<p>Santiago, Chile, 20th (Havas News Agency) - The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently announced that Chilean Ambassador to the United States Mitchell will return to his post from his post in the future. President Ríos greatly appreciates the Ambassador for fulfilling his duties in office. At the same time, Chile's various needs in military, financial and economic matters have also been thoroughly understood by the U.S. government through the Ambassador's repeated explanations. In short, the government's current policy is based on the President's declaration in May of this year regarding the connectedness of the American continent.</p>
<h3>Ship Carrying Munitions to the Philippines Sunk by Germany</h3>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Haitong News Agency) - The German Supreme Headquarters issued a special communiqué stating that German submarines attacked a convoy carrying munitions to the Philippines north of the Azores in the Atlantic Ocean, sinking seven enemy ships, including one large ship carrying munitions, totaling 38,000 tons. One German submarine sailed into the St. Lawrence River, sinking three enemy ships, totaling 15,000 tons. Another ship was hit by a torpedo and damaged (4,500 tons). Six other enemy ships, totaling 51,000 tons, were sunk in U.S. territorial waters. Another enemy freighter was hit by a torpedo and severely damaged. In the past four days, German submarines have sunk 16 enemy ships, totaling 104,000 tons.</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Haitong News Agency) - The German High Command stated that between July 1 and July 20 of this year, enemy ships totaling more than 600,000 tons were sunk, which is 200,000 tons more than the total number of enemy ships sunk in July last year.</p>
<h3>Belgian King Has a Son</h3>

<h3>Hurricane Hits Chaoshan</h3>
<p>Shantou, 21st (Central News Agency) - A rare hurricane with a wind speed of 30 meters per second suddenly hit the Chaoshan area on the morning of the 20th. Although the ships anchored in the port were fortunately not damaged, the power lines in the city were broken and the walls collapsed, causing heavy damage. At the same time, the water brought by the hurricane also caused serious trouble. Japanese troops were dispatched to prevent it from becoming a major disaster. Details of the damage are currently being investigated.</p>
<h3>Clearing of the Taihu Lake Area Expected to be Completed Within a Month</h3>

<h3>The Soviet Union Concentrates a Million Soldiers to Defend Rostov, While German Forces Simultaneously Threaten Stalingrad from the East, West, and South</h3>
<p>Bern, 21st, Allied Press – A Vichy dispatch without funds, broadcasted today, stated that certain German units are already on the River Migolinsk (approximately 40 miles southeast of Buchach) and may have already re-crossed the Koper River (a tributary of the Don, 60 miles east of Migolinsk). Thus, the German vanguard has reached within 120 miles northwest of Stalingrad.</p>
<p>Moscow, 20th, Allied Press – According to frontline reports, the Southern Soviet forces concentrated their troops and artillery power in front of Rostov on Monday night, fighting with all their might to defend this corner of the Caucasus. The Southern Soviet forces, under repeated attacks by German tanks, dive bombers, and paratroopers, are now continuing to retreat southwest, passing through the Don Basin’s rice paddies, wheat fields, coal beds, railways, and steppes. It is reported that after abandoning the important industrial city of Voroshilovgrad, the main Soviet force is retreating in an orderly manner, while fresh troops are being transferred from the heavily guarded northern Caucasus to reinforce the main force in defending Rostov. Their line of defense extends from Rostov along the lower reaches of the Don River. There is still no news as to whether the German forces will attack Stalingrad. It is inferred that the German forces are currently focusing on expanding and deepening their breakthrough in the south.</p>
<p>German Headquarters, 21st, Havas – This afternoon, the German military report stated that the German and allied forces on the southern front in Europe are concentrating all their efforts to attack Rostov from the east, west, and south. The city is ablaze, illuminating the sky. The bridges over the Don River have been destroyed. German forces slightly to the north are rapidly advancing southeast, only 80 kilometers from Stalingrad.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 20th, Allied Press – German and Soviet forces are engaged in a fierce battle in front of Rostov, vying for strategic points. German forces are exerting pressure southward from the entire Don Basin, repeatedly attacking with tanks and dive bombers, and using paratroopers to block the Soviet retreat, throwing the main Soviet force into chaos.</p>
<p>Bern, 21st, Allied Press – According to news received here, German forces are currently attacking Rostov on the Don from three directions. However, Soviet General Timoshenko has concentrated over a million troops to defend the city. From a micro perspective, the Battle of Rostov will be the fiercest struggle since the fall of Sevastopol. Berlin sources indicate that the German vanguard is already within seven kilometers of the city.</p>
<p>Moscow, 21st, Allied Press – According to frontline reports, Soviet forces are still retreating on the southern front. In the area south and east of Voroshilovgrad, Soviet forces are engaged in rear-guard actions. Over the past few days, the fighting in this area has continued to escalate. The Soviet Red Star newspaper admitted that German forces have repeatedly launched fierce attacks in the Voroshilovgrad area, and the situation is becoming increasingly serious. Large German tank units are attempting to break through the defenses, and Soviet forces in some locations have retreated to new positions. Furthermore, the Soviet public announcement this noon stated that on the night of July 10-11, our forces engaged the enemy in the area southeast of Voronezh and Voroshilovgrad. There were no significant changes in other sectors of the front.</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st, Havas – Officials here announced last night that the situation on the Eastern Front is becoming increasingly favorable. Since the rainstorms have stopped, the pursuit of the enemy is being intensified. Part of the German forces continues to advance eastward in the central Don region, approaching Stalingrad. German and allied forces that have reached the lower reaches of the Don are now being followed by infantry. The pursuit south from Voroshilovgrad is still ongoing. The Soviet forces pressing on Rostov from the west have increased their pressure. The focus of the current fighting is concentrated near Rostov. German forces west of Rostov are now attacking the Soviet positions built during the winter. Another part of the German forces is advancing north towards Rostov from Voroshilovgrad. At the same time, German forces on the lower Don have cut off the traffic lines east of Rostov. Now attacking Rostov from the east, Rostov is under attack from multiple directions, and the Soviet defenses there are becoming increasingly precarious.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 21st, Havas – The Soviet-German war has lasted three months. The German offensive along the Don River has slowed somewhat due to increased Red Army resistance and difficulties in supplying their own forces. Regarding the offensive in the Rostov area, although the German army has expanded its foothold on the northern bank of the Don, there is no confirmation as to whether it has gained a foothold on the southern bank. The Soviet authorities have denied the claim that the German vanguard is only 35 miles from Rostov. Regarding the offensive in the Stalingrad area, after the Red Army withdrew from Boguchar six days ago, the Soviet authorities only stated that they are continuing to advance. According to reliable sources, the German army has crossed the Don River in the Migolinskaya area, 35 miles southeast of Boguchar, and has reached the Chopol River, or is said to have already crossed the river. If so, the German army has reached 100 miles northwest of Stalingrad. As for the defense of Voronezh on the upper Don, the fighting is currently most intense on the southwest sides of the city. German forces north of the city are holding their ground waiting for reinforcements.</p>
<h3>The Situation on the Southern Front is Confusing; Soviet Strength Should Not Be Underestimated</h3>
<p>Somewhere on the Ukrainian Border, 20th, Havas – In recent days, torrential rains have fallen in southern Russia, making the roads muddy. However, German forces are still advancing towards Rostov, and the fighting is extremely fierce. It has now been determined that German forces at some points are only four miles from the outskirts of the city. It is likely that the Red Army will not be able to hold out for long, as the possibility of breaking through is gradually decreasing. If they continue to defend the city, it will inevitably lead to a large sacrifice of manpower and resources. The German air force has also been very effective in participating in the fighting, constantly bombing the transportation lines south and southeast of Rostov to prevent Soviet forces from using the Rostov-Salsk-Stalingrad railway line. It is reported that the line has been disrupted in several places, especially the section in the Manych district, where a car bridge has been destroyed. As for the right bank of the Don, German forces have crossed the city of Veshenskaya and are approaching Novocherkassk this morning, now only seven miles from the city. German forces advancing along the Donets River have also attacked Kamensk-Shakhtinsky, and street fighting is currently underway. According to military experts, the Soviet defenders in the Donets basin are in a precarious situation, as they must fight behind the main defense line, that is, the lower reaches of the Donets. And almost all of the Donets industrial area is in the hands of the German army. According to the German side, the fighting in the Donets area has now evolved from a regular, organized war into localized mopping-up operations. The German army's current task is nothing more than mopping up isolated Soviet units. One part of the German army is now advancing northeast of Kamensk-Shakhtinsky, hoping to cut off the city's defenders from the rear. Another part of the German army is attacking southeast, so as to link up with the German army on the Don, thereby forming another pocket to encircle the Soviet army. In fact, the truth of the situation has never been so confusing as it is today. No one knows what the real strength of the Soviet combat units on the southern front is, and no one can determine how many of the encircled Soviet troops will be able to break through. The German side stated that they have recently captured a large number of Soviet troops, and will announce the number soon. According to the latest news from the front, German forces have crossed the Chir River and are attacking Rostov directly. Another part of the German army is advancing towards the Migolinsk district. In addition, Soviet forces have also recently attacked the Kerch Peninsula, attempting to land several times, but have been repelled. It is said that a large amount of German military supplies has been transported to the Crimean Peninsula, probably as a prelude to the attack on the Caucasus.</p>
<h3>Soviet Forces Use New Equipment to Counter German Paratroopers' New Tactics</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 21st, Allied Press – The Moscow correspondent of the Chicago Daily News stated that the German side is currently using new paratrooper tactics and new equipment on the Soviet front, such as giant gliders carrying hundreds of people. However, Soviet forces countering the paratroopers are also using new equipment, such as thousands of American reconnaissance vehicles, to counterattack.</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st, Havas – German officials pointed out that yesterday, German aircraft attacked the Southern Soviet troops and motorized vehicle concentration areas in Eastern Europe. The Povorino railway station was hit by bombs, causing fires in several places and heavy losses. Several freight trains were destroyed. Soviet railways and supply transport in the Rostov area encountered great difficulties due to German air strikes. North of Voronezh, German dive bombers and fighter planes attacked Soviet positions, tanks, and motorized vehicles, causing great losses to Soviet manpower and resources. Air battles occurred in this area, and eight Soviet planes were shot down. Railways southwest and southeast of Moscow continue to be bombed, and five troop trains were destroyed.</p>
<h3>Soviet Strategy is Unpredictable; German Forces Cautious About Possible Counterattacks</h3>
<p>Berlin, 21st, Allied Press</p>
<p>German General Dittmar, in a radio broadcast to the nation on Sunday night, revealed that the German forces have a major defensive line approximately 75 miles behind the current front line in Soviet territory. Dittmar assured the people that the authorities will take all necessary precautions to prevent possible Soviet counterattacks and warned Germans not to be overconfident, saying that the Soviet army is still dangerous. Their current retreat along the vast southern front may be a deliberately implemented strategy. Dittmar also said that the Soviet tactics we are encountering are a completely new kind of tactic, and our plans are also dependent to some extent on Soviet tactics. We must anticipate a large-scale Soviet counterattack at the appropriate time. If so, we should not be caught off guard. We have built a strong line of defense approximately 75 miles behind the current front line.</p>
<h3>Great Sandstorm in Egypt; Fighting Grinds to a Halt; Both Sides Move Troops and Prepare for a Major Battle</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 20th, Allied Press – According to a Reuters war correspondent reporting from Alamein, there was no new development in the fighting on the 20th due to hot winds and sandstorms in the desert area. Only German and Italian heavy tank units launched fierce attacks on British forces in adverse weather, engaging in local battles. The air force also suspended operations due to strong winds.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 21st, Havas</p>
<p>Recent reports from Egypt indicate that the fighting at El Alamein has eased slightly. Although the days are hot, the nights are quite cold, and soldiers need to prepare blankets to get through the night.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Egyptian Border, 20th, Havas – According to reports from Cairo, a sandstorm occurred on the Egyptian front yesterday and has not stopped yet. Therefore, only localized fighting occurred on the front today. After occupying the forward defensive line, the Australian army in the northern sector is consolidating its new positions in the Ruweisat area. The central sector is quiet. In the southern sector, British forces made slight progress on the El Taqa plateau. The German army has built strong positions there, so the British forces were quickly repelled by the Soviet 90th Division, and the situation has returned to a standstill. According to military experts here, although the fighting on the front seems to be calm on the surface, a full-scale battle will break out as soon as the sandstorm stops. General Rommel has reorganized his troops. According to reports from British reconnaissance planes, a large number of trucks and tanks have sped from the west to reinforce the front. Also, war correspondents’ dispatches published in Egyptian newspapers stated that the British artillery is in a very important position in this battle. Repeated attacks by Axis forces have been repelled by the British artillery. British artillery fire is exceptionally fierce and the aiming is extremely accurate. At the same time, it is also very successful in covering the armored vehicle and motorized unit offensives. General McCreery's artillery is very active day and night, regardless of the sandstorm covering the sky in both sides airforce areas. British and American planes also bombed Tobruk Harbor and El Adem airfield. Coincidentally, several transport ships arrived from Greece with a large amount of ammunition and were unloading in Tobruk Harbor, which was also bombed by British and American planes.</p>
<p>Rome, 21st, Havas – Both sides are actively reinforcing troops in North Africa. British troops are being transferred from the Near East to Egypt. However, reports of American troops fighting in North Africa have not been confirmed. It is believed here that the Battle of Alamein is a battle of attrition. British forces have repeatedly attacked in an attempt to prevent the activities of the Axis forces, but have failed. The Axis powers are also using the Alamein battle to contain British forces, preventing them from being transferred to the Eastern Front and the West Indies.</p>
<h3>Hungarian Armored Units Participate in the Eastern Front</h3>
<p>Budapest, Hungary, 20th, Havas – The Hungarian government recently issued a military report stating that our armored units have already joined the fighting on the Eastern Front. This is a historic first for our country. A few days ago, after breaking through enemy positions on the Kursk front, they pursued the enemy towards the Don River basin. Although the enemy attempted to defend the river, they ultimately failed.</p>
<h3>German Side Denies Using Poison Gas</h3>
<p>Berlin, 21st, Havas – Regarding the British newspapers mentioning the issue of poison gas again, the authorities here stated to media representatives last night that the Supreme Command, when recently capturing the Kerch Peninsula, issued a statement saying that the German army did not use poison gas. Now, American newspapers are discussing this matter again, which is extremely dangerous. If theory is a prelude to implementation, then Germany is determined to deal with everything.</p>
<h3>German Army Specifically Protects the Residence of a Soviet Poet</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 21st, Havas – German officials denied yesterday's Reuters report that the residence of Soviet poet Nikolai Gogol in the village of Sorochyntsi, Myrhorod Raion, is currently under the special protection of the German army. The Reuters report that Gogol's residence has been destroyed by the German army is completely inaccurate. After German military authorities arrived in the village, they immediately placed the house under special protection. Photographs taken a few days ago prove that the house is intact.</p>
<h3>Turkish Journalist Delegation Invited to Visit Germany</h3>

Up until now, each of these unions has acted independently. This merger has significant political and social implications.</p>
<h3>Retreating Residents from Dangerous Areas in the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Eisen, 21st, Havas – Eisen’s National News states that people living in the Caucasus, Volga, and Don areas are now mass retreating due to the rapid advance of Marshal von Bock's forces. At the same time, the Soviet authorities are stepping up the construction of fortifications in the area, especially along the Don River. The Soviet authorities have also moved archives stored in Stalingrad, Rostov, Shakhty, and other cities in the Donets region. The Soviet Union has also attempted to transport factory equipment, but only part of it has been successful. Other cities in the rear, such as Saratov, Borisoglebsk, Astrakhan, etc., are also preparing to evacuate people. A large number of refugees have fled their hometowns in Stalingrad and the threatened towns in the northern Caucasus, which has greatly affected the economic life and industrial production in the Soviet rear. Even the people of Moscow are preparing to retreat east. Stalin has already left Moscow for Kuybyshev. It is rumored that for the final struggle, the Soviet Union will massively reorganize the Soviet military headquarters.</p>

In the future, Germany will release French prisoners of war based on the number of French workers willing to go to Germany.</p>
<h3>Canada's Shipbuilding Industry is Currently Experiencing Substantial Development</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 20th, Allied Press – London News, According to the Canadian Chamber of Commerce's July report, the Canadian shipbuilding industry has experienced tremendous development. There are currently 18 large-scale shipyards and many small-scale shipyards. 154 ships of 10,000 tons and 18 ships of 1,700 tons have been built. The first of these ships was fully loaded with goods and arrived in England in February, six months ahead of schedule. This year's shipbuilding tonnage can catch up with Britain.</p>
<h3>Climate Threatens Health, Epidemics Rampant, Shanghai Declared a "Tiger Plague" Zone, Typhoid Fever Spreads and Becomes Prevalent</h3>
<p>The English "Times" reports that, according to a report by Mr. Jordan, Health Officer of the Public Works Department, typhoid fever and lung disease continue to threaten health. Within a week, 50 Chinese people contracted typhoid fever, and 42 died. Six foreigners also contracted the disease, one of whom died. Regarding lung disease patients, Chinese residents accounted for 79, and foreigners accounted for 9. A total of 35 people died from this disease. Furthermore, five Chinese people died from dysentery, and one each died from influenza and malaria. No foreign residents died from the aforementioned diseases, but there are still two who are suffering from influenza and malaria, and have not yet recovered. The director also revealed that, in the past week, a total of 703 Chinese people and 21 foreigners died.</p>
<p>Cholera Discovered Earlier Than in the Past</p>
<p>The Tokyo Japanese Health Association has declared Shanghai a "Tiger Plague" zone because 157 confirmed cases of true cholera have been discovered in the two concessions and the Chinese areas of Shanghai in the past two weeks, as officially confirmed. The discovery of cholera in this cholera zone is a month earlier than in previous years, and the first discovery, which occurred on July 6th, is even more unusual. Before July 19th, between 10 and 20 new cases were discovered daily throughout the area. According to reports, the first discovery of a cholera patient was reported by the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital. Subsequently, the hospital quickly received several patients from the Nanshi area. The next day, cholera patients were discovered in Nanshi and northern Fujian. Within a few days, the total number reached 30.</p>
<p>80 Cases in the Two Concessions. As for the discovery of the "tiger plague" in the two concessions, it occurred a few days after the first discovery in Nanshi. The patient was a blind beggar lying on a French Concession road, who was then carried into a hospital and died. Recently, six cases have also been discovered in a village in the suburbs, which has led to the active handling of epidemic prevention work. In the past week, many cases of the "tiger plague" have also been discovered in the International Settlement. It is said that a total of 80 cholera patients have been confirmed in the two concessions, and the rest have occurred in the Chinese area. According to a staff member of the French Concession Health Department, the spread of cholera in the two concessions may be slower than in the Chinese area, firstly because the water supply in the two concessions is adequate, and secondly because residents living in the Chinese area do not pay attention to maintaining hygiene when drinking water, so cholera bacteria easily invade. The Health Department has issued a stern warning to residents, urging citizens to get a second dose of vaccine as soon as possible. If they do not take precautions, the discovery of cholera cases this year will easily exceed last year's number of 900.</p>
<p>Increasing Number of Vaccination Requests</p>
<p>In fact, local residents are indeed aware of the seriousness of the matter, and have been applying for vaccinations in the two concessions for days. The number of people requesting free vaccinations is extremely large. After the vaccination, each person receives a new certificate. The total number of people requesting re-vaccination is difficult to confirm, but the average daily statistics will soon break previous records. In the French Concession, in addition to the public clinic on Avenue Bai'er, designated smoking rooms and densely populated areas are also carrying out this vaccination work, and the majority of people are indeed being vaccinated at these locations. The authorities in the two concessions are advising those who have not been vaccinated by doctors to go to the aforementioned locations as soon as possible to request vaccination. Furthermore, those who have obtained vaccination certificates from doctors can still exchange them for Public Works Department certificates at the Health Department, as before.</p>
<p>Comparison of Anti-Epidemic Vaccinations Over Two Years</p>
<p>In his report on June, the Health Officer of the Public Works Department revealed that a total of 336,206 people were vaccinated against cholera in June this year, compared to only 98,043 people in June last year. Also, 10,899 people were vaccinated against smallpox in June this year, compared to only 414 people in June last year. According to the report, the reason for this phenomenon is probably due to the increase in the number of people returning to their hometowns this year, as those who wish to return to their hometowns must undergo two vaccinations.</p>
<p>Close Attention to Food and Beverages</p>
<p>According to a report from the Public Works Department Health Officer yesterday regarding the situation in June, the supply of vegetables to the Public Works Department market was smooth and abundant last month, but the supply of pork and fish was very insufficient. The report stated that the current supply of fish, meat, and fruits to the Public Works Department is extremely small. A total of 10,033 animals were slaughtered in the slaughterhouses, compared to an average of 11,029 heads slaughtered each month in previous months. 15,297 pounds of major meats were inspected by the Health Department. Furthermore, in this hot summer, the Health Department is paying close attention to food materials and stated that glass covers should be prepared to prevent flies, and close attention should be paid to all cold drinks, sodas, and other summer refreshments. Many vendors in the vegetable market who do not mark prices and inflate prices have been reported and restricted. As for vendors selling meat without official stamps, they are often fined 50 yuan at a time. According to the Health Officer, the current average daily production of milk is 31,684 pounds, the production of cheese is 310 pounds, and the production of butter is 29 pounds.</p>
<p>Epidemic Hospital Advises Citizens</p>
<p>Recently, the scorching heat has been overwhelming, and after the discovery of true cholera in this city, the authorities in the two concessions have taken various steps to curb the epidemic. The hospitals in this city that handle epidemics are all overcrowded. A reporter inquired at the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital at 25 Chaqing Road. According to reports, the average daily number of outpatients is more than 600, and it has been increasing in recent days. Yesterday (20th), the number reached more than 750. The hospital beds are all occupied, and true cholera is still rampant. The hospital authorities are enthusiastically handling the situation, and are eager to help citizens with their epidemic diseases. Prompt treatment of epidemics is essential. The hospital is busy day and night, providing rapid treatment. Furthermore, it is said that as the "tiger plague" is raging, citizens should pay close attention to their health, which is of utmost importance. It is hoped that the intellectual class will do their best to persuade citizens to 1. get vaccinated against the epidemic, and 2. pay attention to food and beverage hygiene. If anyone is infected, they should be sent to the epidemic hospital immediately, so that they can be treated quickly. If this is done, it will greatly help in eliminating the epidemic atmosphere. The hospital provides daily outpatient services, hospitalization, consultations, and medication, so the daily expenses for medicines and injections are enormous. It is hoped that enthusiastic people in Shanghai will provide financial assistance to prevent the hospital's work from being interrupted, benefiting the poor and sick, which is a blessing for the citizens. Those who wish to donate can send their donations to the hospital, or call 97283 for collection, which is a supreme act of merit.</p>
<h3>Direct Calls to Zhabei, Telephone Sets Must Be Modified, Currently Under Study, Implementation at the End of Next Month, But the Scope is Temporarily Limited to the North of Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of direct telephone access between the concessions and the Zhabei area, which involves the improvement of communications at the Mutu City Telephone Exchange, various sectors are showing great interest. However, according to the person in charge of the Shanghai Telephone Company, this matter is still under design and research by the company's engineering department, and can be implemented roughly at the end of next month, but the scope is temporarily limited to the area north of Suzhou Creek. Furthermore, only users who have a high frequency of calls with Zhabei and have been verified by the telephone company will be allowed to install direct-dialing telephones. As for other areas and users, new installations will not occur until the company's board of directors deems it necessary to have direct calls with Zhabei.</p>
<p>Modify Electrical Machines, Add Switches</p>
<p>Telephones that can directly call Zhabei are slightly different in form from ordinary telephones. According to the design of the Telephone Company's engineering department, a switch-type button is added to the telephone. When you want to call Zhabei, you must press this switch to avoid the usual hassle of being switched by 021. The installation of this type of switch inevitably requires various preparations in terms of procedures, and because the required materials are currently in short supply, it is not possible to assemble them in large quantities.</p>
<p>Implementation First in the North of Suzhou Creek</p>
<p>For trial purposes, the Telephone Company plans to first modify ordinary electrical machines in the area north of Suzhou Creek to enable direct calls to Zhabei, as the two areas are very close to each other, making it easier to handle. However, it is not an ordinary modification. The Telephone Company will check the records beforehand and select users who frequently call Zhabei to modify their telephones. Users who do not need to frequently call Zhabei will be refused if they apply to modify their electrical machines. If direct calls are subsequently extended to other areas of the concessions, this principle will also be followed.</p>
<p>Direct Call Charges Unchanged</p>
<p>The charge for direct calls between the concessions and Zhabei is 3 jiao per call, which is the same as the situation where the call is first dialed "01" and switched by an operator, to show fairness. Regarding the Telephone Company's refusal to install new telephones, it is said that this is actually due to a shortage of telephones and that almost all materials are blocked. However, as for telephone relocation, as long as the number does not need to be changed within the same district, the Telephone Company will handle it as soon as possible. If it is moved to another area, it is equivalent to installing a new telephone in that area, so delays are inevitable in terms of procedures and time.</p>
<h3>Return-to-Hometown Certificates Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>Since this month, the Public Works Department's office for issuing return-to-hometown certificates has shortened its issuing hours to 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and is closed in the afternoon. The office has temporarily suspended issuing certificates since this week, and had not resumed issuing them as of yesterday. It is still unknown whether it will resume operations tomorrow. Furthermore, the number of people obtaining licenses at the Public Works Department's office for issuing bicycle licenses has decreased sharply, so those who have not yet obtained this license can now go and obtain it at any time, without having to suffer the pain of being squeezed.</p>

<h3>Fourth-Term Grain Distribution, Purchase Orders Issued Starting Today, Only White Rice and Flour</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department Information Office announces: The matter of distributing the first batch of rice purchase certificates by the various distribution offices of the Bureau starting on the 20th of this month has been publicly announced on the 17th and 18th of this month. The official date of the above certificate issuance is set to end on August 1st. The certificate receiving date for taxpayers has already been clearly indicated on the back of their summer housing tax receipts. For their own benefit, the taxpayers must go to receive the certificates on time to avoid delays and the occurrence of being unable to purchase rice. Furthermore, the sale of the fifth-term rationed rice is scheduled to begin on August 30th.</p>
<p>In addition, the French Concession authorities announced: Due to the hot weather, the hours for issuing rice purchase certificates have been changed. The residents of each district will be notified by the head of the relevant patrol station as to which day and time to go to the rice certificate distribution office to collect them. Please be informed as necessary.</p>
<p>Prices for Fourth-Term Rice and Flour Purchase Orders</p>
<p>The 659 contracted rice shops in the Public Concession and French Concession are notified by the Rice Ration Management Office to collect the fourth-term grain distribution purchase orders from the office. It is stipulated that the date is July 21st for rice shops in the Public Concession, and July 22nd for rice shops in the French Concession. The price of white rice is 309.3 yuan per bag, and the price of flour is 93 yuan per bag. After obtaining the purchase orders, payment and delivery of goods will be made based on the order. The fourth-term rationed grain allocation amount and price are still awaiting further announcement by the board. However, it is understood that the sales prices of fourth-term white rice and flour are roughly the same as in the third term. Whether or not broken rice will be bundled for sale is still difficult to predict, but the rice shops only receive purchase orders for white rice and flour for the fourth term, and there is no price for broken rice, so the fourth-term grain ration may temporarily suspend bundling the sale of broken rice.</p>
<p>Price Limits on Flour and Flour Products</p>
<p>The Public Works Department recently issued Announcement No. 6007, stipulating that from July 23rd, the price limits for flour and various flour-based foods will be revised as follows: (A) Flour: 1. Wholesale price: 93 yuan per bag weighing 49 pounds. 2. Retail price: 2.4 yuan per jin or 2.2 yuan per pound. Retail stores selling with the "flour coupons" attached to the bread ration card may not sell more than 5 jin or 5.5 pounds each time. (B) Bread: 1. Wholesale price: 2.45 yuan per pound. 2. Retail price: 2.7 yuan per pound. The price of bread of different sizes should be calculated proportionally. (C) Macaroni, vermicelli, dried noodles, and similar products: 1. Wholesale price: 3.65 yuan per pound. 2. Retail price: 4.25 yuan per pound, including packaging. (D) Freshly Cut Noodles: All kinds of freshly cut noodles, whether machine-made or handmade, 2.9 yuan per jin. (E) Large Cakes: 2 jiao per cake, at least 1 jin for every 16 cakes. (F) Shandong Large Cakes: 3 yuan per jin. If less than 1 jin, the price should be calculated proportionally. (G) Fried Dough Sticks: 3 jiao per stick, at least 1 jin for every 12 sticks. (H) Steamed Buns (plain): 2 jiao per bun, at least 1 jin for every 15 buns. As for other points, they will still be handled according to Announcement No. 5773.</p>
<p>Total Number of Rice Certificates Issued</p>
<p>The Allied Press reports that the rationed rice system in this city and the concessions has been implemented since July 6th, and is currently progressing very smoothly. The previous difficulty in purchasing rice has been completely eliminated recently. The Public Works Department recently released the number of rice purchase certificates issued in July as follows: △ Number of rice purchase certificates issued: 492,348 north of Suzhou Creek, 82,973 south of Suzhou Creek, 731,165 in the French Concession, totaling 2,035,576. △ Number of rice purchase certificates actually used: 484,394 north of Suzhou Creek, 801,103 south of Suzhou Creek, 723,170 in the French Concession, totaling 2,008,667. △ Number of unused rice purchase certificates: 26,909. A total of 2,035,576 rice purchase certificates have been issued in the two concessions. Almost all residents of the two concessions have been issued rice purchase certificates. The reason why the number of rice purchase certificates issued is slightly less than the actual population is that the Japanese and the Chinese employees hired by the Japanese receive rice separately, so they are not included in the above number of certificates issued. Also, laborers and other poor people often purchase food from food stalls, etc., and do not need rice purchase certificates, so they are not issued.</p>
<h3>Dry Weather, Prone to Fire</h3>
<p>A salt fish shop at No. 25 Xiaodongdou Street in the French Concession suddenly reported a fire at around 2:27 PM yesterday. Thick smoke filled the air, and the fire spread like wildfire, immediately affecting another salt fish shop at Nos. 27-29 next door. The lower floors were flooded with water. After fire engines arrived to put out the fire, it was extinguished after about an hour.</p>
<p>At around 8:46 PM last night, the paint materials stored inside a Russian paint shop at No. 00 Baixue Road in the French Concession caught fire and exploded, sounding like firecrackers. Fortunately, the fire brigade arrived early and quickly extinguished the fire, so the loss was minimal.</p>
<h3>Authorities Planning to Curb Jewish Economic Activities, Research Has Been Conducted in All Aspects, and Strict Punishment Will Be Pursued</h3>
<p>The Allied Press reports from this city that the local authorities are currently preparing measures to curb the illegal economic activities of Jews here, because these Jews are engaged in speculative trading of goods, counterfeiting famous merchants' products, and engaging in other illegal activities that are harmful to Shanghai residents.</p>
<p>Doing Everything Possible</p>
<p>It is rumored that the crackdown will be implemented through the Baojia self-defense system. The specific details of this plan are currently being studied by the Shanghai Japanese Army and Navy authorities, the Asia Development Board, the Shanghai Public Works Department, and other parties. In the future, anyone found guilty of these illegal activities will be</p>
<p>Severely Punished</p>
<p>Without any leniency. Moreover, Jewish merchants deliberately take advantage of their foreign nationality to engage in these activities, while Chinese people are restricted and cannot do so. Therefore, the authorities are even more indignant about this. The most outrageous of the illegal activities of the Jews is that a Jewish lawyer spread rumors that there is no need to pay business taxes to the Public Works Department.</p>
<h3>Xinzha Police Station Busts Counterfeit Drugs</h3>
<p>Tiger Balm is created by the Hu Wenhu and Wenbao brothers, prominent overseas Chinese merchants from Southeast Asia, and is sold all over the world. Since the suspension of maritime transport in Shanghai and the interruption of goods from Yong An Tang, unscrupulous people have been counterfeiting drugs for profit. On the 4th of this month, the Xinzha Police Station busted a case of counterfeiting Tiger Balm iron boxes, large and small square order trademarks, wrapping paper, etc., and arrested Zhang Ming and Chen Danzhao, two counterfeiters, and prosecuted them for the crime of counterfeiting drugs. After interrogation and confirmation, Zhang and Chen were each sentenced to six months imprisonment to punish them as a warning to others.</p>

<h3>British Overseas Chinese in the Far East, Evacuation Has Been Scheduled, Ryuta Maru and Kamakura Maru are About to Arrive in Shanghai, List of Officials and Civilians Being Evacuated is Being Compiled</h3>
<p>The English "Da Mei Evening News" reports that Mr. Masaki, the chief translator of the Japanese Consulate General, announced yesterday that approximately 1,800 officials and civilians from the United Kingdom and other European countries at war with Japan who are evacuating from the Far East will be transported from Shanghai by the Ryuta Maru and Kamakura Maru on the 3rd and 16th of next month, respectively, to Laurenço Marques in East Africa.</p>
<p>Two Ships Arriving in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Ryuta Maru is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 2nd of next month, carrying officials evacuated from Japan and Manchuria. The overseas Chinese who have gathered in Shanghai from other ports and other evacuees will board the ship on the following day and depart for the Philippines. Those who do not take the Ryuta Maru will travel on the Kamakura Maru. The ship is expected to arrive here from Yokohama on August 14th and leave Shanghai on the 16th.</p>
<p>List to be Compiled</p>
<p>According to Mr. Masaki, in general, the Ryuta Maru is exclusively for carrying evacuated overseas Chinese from Japan, Manchuria, and various parts of China, while the Kamakura Maru is limited to carrying overseas Chinese from Shanghai and other ports. The list of evacuees is still being compiled and cannot be announced in terms of the allocation of the number of people. The above two ships are only used for evacuating overseas Chinese, and each ship carries 900 people. However, it does not deny the possibility of requisitioning a third ship.</p>
<p>Kontofan Di</p>
<p>The Ryuta and Kamakura Maru are of the same type as the Kontofan Di Wheel. The former has a load capacity of 16,800 tons, and the latter is about 17,000 tons. It is reported that the Kontofan Di Wheel departed Shanghai on the 29th of last month with 636 American officials and civilians and joined the Japanese postal ship Asama Maru on the New Singapore sea surface, and traveled to the Philippines. It is learned that it will arrive in Marguez yesterday.</p>

Peach Blossom Lady Lin cloth opened at $264.40, gradually rising to $269.50, an increase of $6 per bolt. Although transactions for other coarse and fine cloths were not numerous, they uniformly announced price increases, such as 16-pound Earth coarse cloth at $183, Flying Goose at $180, 12-pound Earth fine cloth at $170, Big Peng at $165, Rich and Noble New Single at $167, Rich and Noble Fine Twill at $164, Magnolia Bleached Cloth at $169, Qin Liangyu Bleached Cloth at $159, Longevity House Silk at $6.35, Volleyball at $7.10, all were quite tight.</p>

Prices were particularly firm and elegant. 12-pound Dragon Head Fine Cloth New Single rose from $187 to close at $190, an increase of $7.50 from the previous day. Bank Single Dragon Head was $166.50, Colorful Ball Fine Cloth was $171.50, Four Gentlemen Serge opened at $7.10, peaking at $7.38, and closed at noon at $7.36. The situation was solid and stable.</p>
<h3>Bond Market Remains Dull as Before</h3>
<p>Government bonds were secretly strong. Yesterday the market naturally hovered, feeling that people's hearts were relatively stable. Sellers did not seem as eager as before. Buyers were more composed and no longer in the state of having it or not having it that they had been in before. However, there was not much improvement in transactions. Those trying to profit from small fluctuations were relatively few, and most were still watching and waiting. The trend was still mired in hovering and dullness. The small fluctuations in government bonds were also a common phenomenon in the past. However, in the past, they were mostly due to a lack of new stimulus. Recently, they have been completely affected by regulation and control, brewing for a long time, and it is still unknown when they will be able to recover. Yesterday's results were still mixed, with ups and downs. Except for Class B, which was down a small amount of $0.03, Class C had no changes, and the rest all rose $0.21. Transactions were about $600,000 to $700,000. A concise table is listed below.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Rise and Fall Unevenly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market situation for Chinese merchant stocks: Dasheng No. 3 Factory had some kind of favorable news, which was greatly absorbed by those with capital. Market prices were firm. Zhabei Water and Electricity was still sluggish. Zhao Hua Commercial Gas Stock had rebounded and had a good chance of being covered. New Pharmaceutical Industry and New Asia fell slightly, Biochemical continued to rise, and the rest were mediocre. Department stores and Yong'an were still favored by buyers, New World softened, Cultural Stocks were flat and weak, and Great China Match continued to decline. Various stocks rose and fell, hovering. Seeing that people's hearts were stable in all directions, transactions were quite active. Now, the market prices of various stocks are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3>Gold and Silver Ornaments: Exchange Rates Unchanged</h3>
<p>Yesterday in this city, gold and silver jewelry stores, the Da Xin and Tong Hang companies still displayed the original price of $2,250 per tael for retail sales (purchases were reduced by $350). The exchange price among industry members was a little over $20, between $1,950 and $1,960 per tael. Transactions were even rarer. As for jewelry sycee silver, it was still listed at $16 per tael, with the inter-industry exchange price at $15.50.</p>
<h3>Call Loan Rate Raised Again by Four Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Money Trade Association's call loan rate was raised again by four cents, to nineteen cents. In the past two days, it has soared by eight cents, which is the silver and money industries raising interest rates. The discount rate for new remittance drafts and notes remains flat, it is said.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market price for military bonds, the inter-industry exchange price was between $5.545 and $5.55, still flat. Money changers and bank storefronts were buying in at $5.54, but selling at $5.555, or even $5.56, slightly firm, it is said.</p>
<h3>Glutinous Rice Branches Will Arrive Soon</h3>
<p>Glutinous rice branches have a fragrant aroma, thick flesh, small pits, and are soft and glutinous. Last year, due to a poor harvest, they were scarce, and even old stock was out of stock for a long time. It is heard that this year's harvest is better. According to news from the Guang Bang Company, new shipments should arrive in Shanghai soon for testing, it is said.</p>
<h3>Sophora Flower Buds Slightly Rise</h3>
<p>Although the consumption of pagoda tree flowers has not been significant recently, because prices are still low, the market is very firm. For example, ordinary goods are still less than $100 per picul. Checking the price of each hemp bag, it also needs about $30, so the cheapness of the capital can be imagined. Currently, the selling price of green pagoda tree flowers from Tianjin is $120 to $130, and the next grade is $110 to $90.</p>
<h3>Beans Move Actively; Prices Rise by Ten Dollars</h3>
<p>The market situation for beans: yesterday, mung beans were moving more actively, and prices soared by more than ten dollars. The rest of supply and demand was still flat. It is estimated that there were over a hundred packages of Dajin seal beans, with high-grade goods priced at $235, Zhongguan goods at $220, 20 packages of Pinghu Dolichos beans, priced at $200, 50 packages of Chongming sea silkworm beans, priced at $210.</p>
<p>Both arrivals and sales of dried sweet potatoes were few, and the market was stable. It is estimated that there were 40 packages of dried sweet potatoes from Jiangbei, priced at $107.</p>
<p>The domestic sales of bean cakes were lackluster yesterday, and sentiment turned weak. Prices fell by one or two dollars under scattered retail sales. It is estimated that there were 500 pieces of new fifth-month goods of Li Zi Cake, priced at $65.50, 500 pieces of Shen Ji Cake, ordered for May from Yoshida Warehouse, priced at $66.50, and 500 pieces of June Wangu Warehouse order, priced at $63.50.</p>
<p>Bran: yesterday, due to sluggish sales, it turned flat. It is estimated that there were 150 packages of San Xin small-package bran, ordered on May 15, priced at $94.</p>
<h3>Sugar Shares to Return Capital Soon; Traded Prices Slightly Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar stock orders from the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office, because the third installment of capital refund was decided to be issued in April, each share of coarse sand and red sand stock will receive ten dollars in military bonds, so the trend of the association's trading board slightly improved. Coarse sand shares opened at $301 and closed at $303, a good increase of two dollars. Even the red sand shares, which had not been traded for a long time, had transactions, priced at $283 to $285. A total of over two thousand packages were traded.</p>
<h3>Arrowroot Flour Gradually Tightens</h3>
<p>Arrowroot flour: because the Qingniao gang continued to make purchases, the market trend rebounded again. The selling price of Lao Qilin Mark rose by another fifty dollars, traded at over four hundred dollars, and the upper and lower grades also increased accordingly. The market picture is firm and elegant.</p>

<h3>A Record of Listening to Radio Broadcasts by the Pillow</h3>
<p>— Mu Rong</p>
<p>On the 16th of this month, the Tan family and sons collaborated on "A Gathering of Heroes" at the Chang'an Theater in the old capital, and the radio station also broadcasted it. After listening, I wrote this record for the enjoyment of fellow enthusiasts. When I first started listening, it had already progressed to Ziyi and Gongjin drunkenly falling asleep in the tent. The clown role in the Fuying troupe was originally Ci Ruiquan, or Ru Fuxian. After Elder Ci's death, Sun Shengwu replaced him. This time, Sun Shengwu went to Shanghai, and Ru Fuxian did not play Jiang Gan that evening, but Ma Fulu replaced him. I don't know why. Fulu's casual singing and acting are well known. The reciting of stealing the letter was like gulping down a whole date. The only good thing was that his voice was loud and clear. Miao Xiang's Zhou Yu's voice was not as pleasant as Sheng Chan's. There was too much of his original voice in his dialogue, probably due to insufficient zhongqi. Liu Yanting's Huang Gai was very good. His voice was hoarse, with some of Qian Jinfu's flavor. When performing the bitter tactic, he used a nasal sound for the ying character of the Cao camp when feigning surrender, which won cheers from the audience. Later, when he ordered Kan Ze to deliver the letter to the Cao camp, his long speech was resolute and decisive, which could be used as a model for future generations. Fuying's Lu Su was still good. His original board was steady during the "Borrowing Arrows with Straw Boats." The two characters "shihou" in "zheban shihou" were slower and rounder than the record he made. At the end, Kong Ming borrowed the wind, and the singing was novel and flowery, not inferior to Lian Liang. The best part was the shouts below shujiu tian shao dongfeng, purely in a low tone, which was extremely pleasant to listen to. Xiao Pei's former Kong Ming was experienced, calm, and more so than Fuying, but unfortunately, he was old and weak, with the same ailment as Miao Xiang. The best part was that Lu Su and Dao Chuan both had a smile after the character "huo" in their hands. The three people divided it clearly and explained it clearly. Xiao Pei's was cold and sarcastic, Miao Xiang's was hateful and fearful, and Fuying's was foolish and straightforward, purely a natural expression, with black and white clearly distinguished, and guests and hosts clearly separated. After beating Huang Gai, Zhou Yu saw Kong Ming sitting痴drinking, knowing that this plan was known by this Taoist, and angrily drew his sword to kill him. Gongs and drums sounded, and I could imagine Zhangren Feng's angry face, wanting to kill his old in-law, causing his good son-in-law to bow and scrape aside, which was worth a laugh. Yang Shengchun's Zhao Yun's voice was not as loud as Gao Shenglin's. The other Wang Quankui's Cao Cao, Song Jiting's Kan Ze, etc., were all mediocre. The north and south are separated, and hearing this good news can relieve a thirst.</p>
<h3>Visiting Stage Artists: Xia Xia Creates "The Widow's Home"</h3>
<p>— Lan Ying</p>
<p>In addition to having excellent and moving acting skills, Xia Xia also has a pen that is good at writing. At the end of last year, she completed a play about women's issues called "The Widow's Home," which will be performed soon. Therefore, our conversation started with "The Widow's Home":</p>
<p>"I heard that Ms. Xia's 'The Widow's Home' will be staged soon."</p>
<p>"Yes, soon. These days I am looking for a troupe to perform it. Most of the people who play the roles are familiar to the audience, and I myself may be one of them—the plot of 'The Widow's Home' has been circling in my mind for I don't know how many years—" She has great confidence in this script. She earnestly told me in detail from the beginning how this story sprouted, how it affected her, and how it was finally written and prepared for performance. She said that she would make a detailed introduction of this process in the preface to "The Widow's Home," so I am happy to save a stroke here. Later, she also told me that she had thought about the whole thing in order to publish "The Widow's Home," because although she had the wish to print the book, she couldn't find the money to print it! As a result, she got a possible solution: to borrow money from the audience, and after the book is published, repay it with books or current assets plus interest. She is confident that this will be realized. In the end, whether things will succeed or not is not on the cards, but her spirit is commendable!</p>
<p>"Have you written any other scripts besides this one?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but I only wrote half of some of them and then abandoned them. Some are a bit scattered, and I have never bothered to sort them out, so I can't show them to people."</p>
<p>"What kind of work would you like to do in the future?"</p>
<p>"It's always nothing more than writing plays, acting, directing plays..." She seems to regard "drama" as supreme, and for drama, she can even sacrifice everything.</p>
<p>"Ah—however, maybe, in the end, you will become a virtuous wife and loving mother who specializes in housework!" I am sorry, it is probably not right to say such things.</p>
<p>At that time, she smiled naturally and said, "It won't happen. There are certainly many opportunities for me to do this, but at least for now, I like drama the most, and I don't think I will leave drama."</p>
<p>She likes to watch movies most in her spare time. Among the many plays she has performed, she likes "Miaofeng Mountain" the most.</p>
<p>As for her skills, everyone already knows them. Now we hope to see the premiere of her debut work as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Rumors About Li Lihua's Marriage</h3>
<p>— Wang Jun</p>
<p>Rumors Circulating Outside are Almost Comical</p>
<p>Recently, it has been rumored that Li Lihua is in love with the famous Peking opera actor Ji Yuliang, and there are even rumors about marriage. In order to understand the truth, the author made a special trip to Li Lihua's residence for an interview. According to Li Lihua herself, "Ji Yuliang and I are just very ordinary friends. He is a colleague of my mother, so naturally he knows me. As for someone saying that I often go in and out of cafes and other social places with him, it is really absurd. Now they are even saying that I am going to marry Ji Yuliang, which is completely nonsense."</p>
<p>At that time, Li's mother, Zhang Shaoquan, was also at home. According to what she told the author, "Would I marry my daughter to Ji Yuliang, who already has a wife and children? Where did that come from? I don't understand why they want to spread rumors. Moreover, Ji Yuliang has already left Shanghai, which proves that this rumor is absurd."</p>
<p>The author also asked, "Does Miss Li have any relationship with the Lihua Theater?" According to her, "There is no relationship at all. The manager of the theater, Mr. Li Yuyu, is also not acquainted with me."</p>
<p>Li Lihua has two new works, "Autumn" and "Han Shan Night Rain," which are being worked on at the Zhonglian General Factory and the Third Factory respectively. She is running around all day and is extremely busy, and there is no way to talk about anything else.</p>
<h3>Random Notes on the Entertainment Arts</h3>
<p>— Liang Yu</p>
<p>In Shanghai's young amateur opera circles, two comets have been newly discovered in the female roles. One is Ni Chengbo from Liang She, who specializes in Qingyi and has a very strong voice. The other is Yu Qimei, who recently joined Golden Theater and formally went into professional acting. Yu has recently taken Wang Lanfang as her teacher and specializes in Huashan. According to people in the amateur opera circles, Yu Qimei's charming smile is second to none after Rong Boming. I have not seen her in action, but the other day when she played the empress in Er Jin Gong, she was exhausted and hoarse. I broke into a sweat for her. In the future, it is best to sing less of this kind of play that is not right for her skills.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Zhesheng's Tongchui Huahuasheng, except for his slightly lacking speech, can actually be compared to Wang Quankui (his use of nasal sounds is not as free as Wang Quankui, but his voice is wider and richer). Mr. Yang Dingxi, a famous amateur xiaosheng, told me earlier that Mr. Zhang's voice was once very hoarse, and only recently recovered slightly. It is suitable for short plays, but not for long and complicated ones. Recently, I listened to his Er Jin Gong, and did not expect that his voice was so good, flawless from beginning to end. Then I knew that there was no falsehood under a great reputation.</p>
<p>Sun Jinglu recently joined the Green Treasure Theater. All the supporting actors are still the old team from the Xuan Palace era. Due to the sweltering weather, and also because she has just given birth, Ms. Sun's appearance has thinned down, and her voice is also slightly lighter. Whether in appearance, speech, or acting skills, when talking about it now, what can be called "not-so-bad", and what can be called "four-not-whatever"? Not fat, not thin, not tepid, not fiery. And the spacious and comfortable armchair in the Green Treasure is also worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Jin Suwen is said to be succeeding Sun Jinglu at the Green Treasure, but Ms. Jin's personality makes her unsuitable for plays like "Sunrise." For the sake of business, her husband, Mr. Hu Tiwei, had better write a few scenes of "Tears and Laughter" for her to play, and include a scene of storytelling with a drum. Maybe it will be captivating.</p>
<h3>CZC Entertainment Enterprise Company Established</h3>
<p>— Yi De</p>
<p>Including Drama, Dance, Opera, Music, Puppet Shows...</p>
<p>In countries with developed entertainment industries, large-scale companies invest heavily. In large cities in the United States, there are many such entertainment companies. On the one hand, they help the development of the entertainment industry, and on the other hand, they can gradually improve the quality of the entertainment programs.</p>
<p>In recent years, Shanghai's entertainment industry has been presenting a very prosperous phenomenon, but all are small-scale individual developments. No one has ever been willing to invest huge capital in the entertainment industry and operate on a larger scale, because it is not as easy to profit from speculative ventures. Now, there is exciting news for the entertainment industry: the recently established CZC Entertainment Enterprise Company is preparing to invest a large amount of capital to create a new look for Shanghai's entertainment industry.</p>
<p>CZC Company includes five sections: drama, dance, opera, music, and puppet shows, etc., concentrating the most outstanding actors in Shanghai, recruiting famous entertainment talents from China and abroad, and performing through cooperation. CZC Company is responsible for managing each section and regularly performs at famous theaters in the city.</p>
<p>Now, puppet shows are the first to be staged, which is a collaboration with the Jewish businessman Gao Tianlun. The drama section will also be performed in late July or early August at a major theater in the city with air-conditioning. All of Shanghai's first-class writers and directors are participating, and the actors already include Xia Xia, Lan Lan, Zhi Jun, Mei Cun, Gao Yang, and Tian Ran, among dozens of others. The opera, dance, music, and other sections responsible by Westerners are also progressing separately. The company has decided to invest the greatest human and material resources so that the entertainment industry can have a very noble and normal development under more affluent economic conditions.</p>
<h3>Sharing Weal and Woe</h3>

<p>(7) Thunderbolt</p>
<p>For the sake of this will, a drastic change had taken place in 維城的’s mind. Firstly, the collection of Yuan Ji Xianren’s calligraphy and paintings had stopped; secondly, his own future, such as studying and employment, were all presented in a gloomy color; thirdly, none of the people in front of him were the ones he loved the most or were relatively loving. 維城 valued this will, as if a courtier in the feudal era had received the emperor’s sacred decree. From the Shuangmei Study, he held 釗 to the bedroom. Ye Da’s wife’s words were written on a eight-lined note with red lines. He was recalling: it was not clipped in the collection of books in the Shuangmei Study: it was found in a pile of old books and papers turned over in the attic. This was not written when his mother was critically ill; it was written when his mother was still quite healthy. Although the will would not specify a certain month and day, it could be guessed that the day must have been a long time ago.</p>
<p>It was midnight, and he was sitting upright alone. The cold wind outside the oyster window was howling with a hiss, and occasionally, a sharp strand of wind blew in from the gaps in the window, and the bean-like light flickered. He propped up his tired eyes and looked at the words on the will. The two characters 程炳 suddenly became particularly large, as large as a person's face, ferocious, fierce, ugly, floating on the paper. He gritted his teeth, clenched his fists, and was about to raise his hand, but there was nothing again. When he rubbed his eyelids and looked again, it was still his mother's handwriting, and there was no 程炳's face. He put the two characters 程炳 in his mouth and recited them, reciting them once and pounding his chest once,拍一下 the table. Later, the depression in his chest forced him to shout "程炳!" His eardrums suddenly heard his own shout, and his mind recovered. He thought that it was so late at night that the family would hear it, and they would be surprised. He did not want the family to be surprised, so he immediately blew out the fire and sat in the dark. (134)</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Talks on the Arts</p>
<h3>Puppet Show</h3>
<p>— Ze Fu</p>
<p>It is said that puppet shows originated in the time of King Mu of Zhou. The Liezi Tangwen chapter says, "The dancer created by Yan Shi, when the string is pulled, they tap and sing in rhythm, and when their hands are held, they dance to the beat." However, the Liezi is a pseudo-book, and its saying is mostly allegorical, and it may not be credible. It is also said that they originated in the time of Emperor Gaozu of Han. The Yuefu Zalu says, "When Gaozu was in Pingcheng, he was surrounded by Modu. Chen Ping visited and learned that Guan Shi was jealous, so he created wooden puppets that used mechanisms to dance on the wall. Yue Yi said they were living people, and Modu was afraid of it, so he withdrew his troops." However, this saying is based on rumors and is not seen in historical books, so it is difficult to make people believe it. However, the Tongdian says, "Kuileizi made puppet shows, good at singing and dancing, originally music for funerals, and was first used in joyful gatherings at the end of the Han Dynasty." Then this play did exist in the Han Dynasty. However, in the beginning, it mostly focused on action. It did not become a formal drama until the Song Dynasty, so the performances also had stories. And there were many names, including "Suspended String Puppets," which are now called string puppets: "Staff Head Puppets," which seem to be those played by hand, now also called hand puppet shows: "Medicine-Powered Puppets," whose movements seem to be human-made and powered by music: "Flesh Puppets" are played by young children; "Water Puppets" are played on water. The Ming and Qing dynasties also called them palace plays because they were often performed in the palace. Today, only the first two types are still passed down to the world, and the latter three types are no longer heard of.</p>
<h3>Art Scene</h3>
<p>— Zhi Yu</p>
<p>Li Yi's three-act comedy "Between Men and Women" will be performed by the Shanghai Art Troupe after it "sees the light again", and Yu Jin will be invited to direct it.</p>
<p>After the disbandment of the Modern Theater Troupe, Xie Xing Company has transferred the site of the Hongbao Theater to Pan Zhi to take over.</p>
<p>Zhonglian is scheduled to complete new films this month, including "Siamese Lotus", "Telescope", "Spring", "White Angel" etc. "Two Generations of Women" and "Sister, Sister" will soon begin filming. Finally, "Roses Everywhere", "Hating Meeting Before Marriage", "Under the Peony Flower" will be completed in turn in the near future.</p>
<p>Wen Yimin's directed "Mother's Heart", starring Wang Yin and Yuan Meiyun; Wang Yin also plays two roles as brothers, and Yuan Meiyun also plays two roles as mother and daughter.</p>
<p>There are not just three or four newly opened cabaret theaters, and the Jielu billiard room on the way to Chaqia Township has also been converted into a cabaret theater, which will open soon.</p>
<p>The Qingguang Theater Troupe has been meticulously prepared and has been organized. The organizer of the troupe, Zheng Da, also chose to perform "Parasitic Grass" for the first time at the Lafayette Theater on the 26th of this month, and the cast of actors is quite complete.</p>
