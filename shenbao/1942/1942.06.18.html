<h3>五·埃及縱橫談</h3>
<p>（農村特寫）尼羅河兩岸的居民用灰色的泥土築成土牆，一進村落，就覺地位侷促，聲音嘈雜，人和牲畜的聲浪交　，到處在燃焚牛糞，空氣中揚溢着一陣鄕土所特有的氣息。一淸早，街上已是人聲鼎沸了。那邊銅匠店門口停拴着一匹驢子，這牲口頑皮成性，不停地用脚跟踐踢着。主人正從驢背上下一匹藍蔴布，向銅匠店老板兜銷。恰巧木村中的剃頭司務拖了一雙拖鞋，從那面施施然跑來，銅匠老板曾給他打過一隻理髮銅盤，現在無心買這匹蔴布，就介紹給剃頭司務。可是剃頭司務正是怪可憐的，和人家剃了一年頭，人家送他一籃扁豆，那有閑錢買這種衣料？那向有幾個孩子趕着鴨子玩，鴨子跑上一堆乾河泥上面去，孩子們也追上定要捉住牠。一個乞丐跨了一匹驢子而來，看見此地人頭很多，下驢求乞，數着乞得的錢，再跨上這瘦瘠得可憐的老驢，喃喃而去。</p>
<p>忽然街的一端起了尖聲叫喊：一匹騾子，就了六倍於牠　重的貨物，把一桶牛奶撞翻。原來顧客要親眼看農婦把牛奶搾在桶中，以防牠背後從中摻水。在旁邊觀看的閑人園成一個大圈子，街上的交通因之停頓了好久。接著，一匹高大的路　仲長了頭頭，　　罷罷而來，背峯拴着了又大又重的糧食　　匹駱駝一眼瞧見街邊的一叢野草，低了頭很自若地嚼　，不耐煩的衆人在周圍　嘈。在種種喧嘩之中，又有一種聲浪自空中飛來，那是回敎禮拜堂尖塔中報時刻的敎徒，朗誦今天第二次的定時呼喚。</p>
<p>（曆法的推算）埃及人因尼羅河的氾濫，很自然的把一年分成三個部份，洪水時期，播種時期，收穫時期。一年定爲十二月，一月定爲三十天。這樣，每年總是多出幾天，積了五百年，恰好把原來的洪水季變成收穫季。爲要改正這錯誤，就得重新計算：六千年之前已有人發明我們現在所用的歷法，不能不贊　，那時代人民的偉大。埃及人不特在歷法一端已有發明，此後對於天文，地理，建築，繪書都漸次昌明。就是裝節一項，在紀元前二千年時代，他們已知道用項圈圍在頸間。而且對於寳石琢磨之精，金銀鑲配之細，這種技術的神妙，和怎樣用一大塊一大塊石頭堆成龐大無比的金字塔一樣，令我們現代人莫明其妙。</p>
<p>（金字塔－誇大狂的產物）尼羅河目上埃及蜿蜓北行，浩浩蕩蕩，一直到達非洲最大的城市開羅，河面廣闊，水流平穩。西岸是一片廣大的綠地，東岸有羣山作爲屏障。尼羅河的河道到此爲止，此後再北行，分散爲瑣碎的河流網，就是著名的大三角洲了。（Deltr）</p>
<p>開羅到五十哩，六座金字塔接連地轟起在綠色的郊野中。光綫很明朗，山脈又低，在尼羅浦上望去甚爲淸晰。這不是神像的聖堂，不是權力的象徵，也非爲了生活的享受：金字塔的建迭，完全是統治者的誇大狂和對於死亡的畏懼，才興造此千古不會磨滅的熱術建築物。</p>
<p>有金字塔旁邊，還有一座獅身人面石像。石像的一半已經埋人泥沙，據說在一時期中石像全體要陷入泥土。後來皇子羅瑪雪在某次行　時，偶然在石像畔午睡，於是獅身人面的史芬克司托夢給皇子：「你如能把我發掘出世，我便幫助你成爲埃及國王。」後經皇子大風砂掩埋。到數千年後的今賞，和金字塔一樣，成爲誇耀的發掘，總算沒有被沙漠中的日，世界獵奇者還能去觀摩贊世界的古蹟。</p>

<h3>若干商店重定貨價　無形提高物價　公衆應即告發</h3>
<p>上海泰唔士報云本市三區市政當道、爲對付暴利與囤積而發之最重要統制物價條例、於昨（十七日）晨起生效、公衆留意物價之變更、俾見有違背條例情事、立即報吿當局者頗不乏人、查公共租界法租界與西區、已於星期一夜宣布、從昨晨起至續發通吿止、用儲券計算之零售物價、不得超過五月二十六日至二十八日間舊法幣平均物價之半、此舉已見效、蓋若干商店、紛將價標除去、重定售價也、緣許多奸商並不調整售價、僅在原價上添書儲券、遂使其價無形中提高一倍、其確將舊價改低者、寥寥無幾、當局乃頒佈聯合命令、迫令商人規定公允之售價、</p>
<h3>銀錢業緊縮放款　規定存欠息二分四厘至三分存息最高利率為一分</h3>
<p>同盟社訊、本市銀錢各業、前因游資充斥、存款激增、而工商業不振聲中、大好資金無法運用、以致坐耗存息、虧蝕甚鉅、存款被提日鉅、大部份遊資又轉移從事實業、因此各銀行錢莊存款漸形減少、茲以實施新通貨以來、各銀錢資金庫存及一切存放款、均按照二對一比率折成儲備券、現已決定提高欠息、抑低存意、欠息規定二分四厘至三分、存息最高為一份、據此原則、由各銀行莊斟酌辦理、</p>

<p>兩租界公用車輛、昨起均已停止收用舊法幣、唯法界之電車公共汽車、仍收用舊輔幣券、因法商電車公司之通吿、僅調停用一元或一元以上之舊法幣也、至於公共租界電車、公司當局雖已通告拒收一切舊法幣、然事實上、昨日仍收受單角票、同時亦往往以之找給乘客、此因公共租界電車票價有儲券五分之零數、而五分儲券頗少流通、遂暫以舊輔幣券一角券代替應用、</p>

<h3>端午史話　柳塘</h3>
<p>向以五月為毒月，重五日爲惡日，由來　古，而不知說之所來、後漢書有云：</p>
<p>「仲夏　月，萬物方盛，日夏至，陰氣萌作，恐物不楙；其禮，以朱索連葷菜，彌牟，朴蠱鐘，以桃印，長六寸，方二寸，五色書文如法，以施門戶。代以所尙爲餚：夏后氏金行，作葦菱，言氣交也。殷人水德，以螺首愼其閉塞，使如螺也。周人木德，以桃為更，言氣相更也。　兼用之，以五月五日，朱索　色印爲門戶飾，以難止惡氣。」</p>
<p>夏至爲五月節，於卦象為大風垢三三一陰始生：冬至則爲（地雷復三三）陽始生、夏至在江南，正值雨季，蓋芒種逢內人霉，恰値夏至之前，出霉又在夏至之後，自經雨季父來暑熱，百物固報之以長，而毒虺害蟲以及疫癘暑病，由是而滋蕃，此古人所以惴惴然惟恐萬物不得暢茂，既無法預防，亦無術驅除，只可出以厭禳之法：朱索五色桃印爲門戶飾，以難止惡氣，即後薩世蒲劍門符之前身也。因之設五月為毒月，不無意義。</p>
<p>夏至雖爲五月中節，但俗有「夏至夕難逢端陽節，百　難遇歲朝春」之說：誠然，端午逢夏至，確乎不多：民國十八年失之遲日，然官統元年，固爲夏至正逢端陽節也。而民國十二年又爲歲朝春，故年在三十四歲生於五日以前，所謂難遇難逢者，皆已躬逢之矣。</p>
<p>謂五月五日爲惡日者，則見於史記孟嘗君傳：</p>
<p>一田嬰有子叫十餘人，其賤妾有子名文；文以五月五日生，嬰吿其母曰：弗舉也。其母竊舉生之。及長，其母，因兄弟而見其子文於田嬰。田嬰怒其母曰，吾今若去此卜，而敢生之，何也？文頓首因曰：君所以不舉五月子者，何故？嬰曰：五月子者，長與戶齊，將不利其父母。文曰：人牛受命於天乎？將受命於戶耶　嬰默然。文曰：必受命於天，君何憂焉！必受命於戶，則髙中戶耳！　　至者。嬰曰：子休矣。</p>
<p>而文卒立爲世子，稱孟嘗君，於是五月五日所生子皆舉生，出田文始。舉者，　浴而乳之　也：生者，計長養之也，按風俗通云：俗說五月五日生子，男害，父女害母也。此雖迷信之談，然至今仍有五月月五日生者命硬之說：命硬者，言其能傷尅堂上，如王鎭惡夕生亦猶是也、南史云</p>
<p>一王鎭惡：祖猛，仕苻堅任兼將相。父休，爲河東太守。鎮惡以五月生，家人以俗忌：欲令出繼歸宗。猛曰：此非常兒，昔日孟嘗君惡月生，而相齊，是兒亦將興吾門矣。故名爲鎭惡。］</p>
<p>鎭惡後歸晋，入宋爲名將。但亦有以端五日生者爲吉，即以「楓落吳江冷傳世之唐詩人嵟信明是也。新唐書云：</p>
<p>「信明之生，五月五日日方中，有異雀鳴集庭樹。太史令史良為占曰：五月爲火，火主離，離爲文。日中，文之盛也。雀五色而嗚，此兒將以文顯，然雀類微。位殆不髙耶！］</p>
<p>固應其言。又據冷廬雜誌所載［五月五日生見之於史書者，如孟嘗君，胡廣，壬鳳，張桓侯飛，王鎮惡，齊後中，齊南陽王綽，崔信明，宋微宗，翁應龍，紀邁，遼懿德皇后，趙元是等，其遭遇不同一。</p>
<p>確然，歷代史官，料於端午日生者，似乎特加注意，大書特書然就所知，如宋徽宗係十月十日生，日宋代諸帝中，唯宋髙宗爲五月二十一日生，餘未有爲五月者。父按遼無懿德皇后，唯宋太宗符后有此謐。此二人疑均有誤。至其中所記，不少爲帝王公侯，但如齊後主昆仲，雖異母，而爲同年同月同日生，綽爲齊武成帝高湛之長子，以五月五日辰時生，至午時叉生後主緯。綽母李夫人非正嫡，故眨爲第二，而以後主爲長子。後主嘗問綽在州（綽嘗爲刺史）何者爲最樂。綽曰：多取蠍，將蛆混看，極樂。後主即夜索蠍一斗，比曉，得二三升，置諸浴斛，使人裸臥浴斛中，號叫宛轉，帝與綽臨觀，喜噱不已。謂綽曰：如此樂事，何不早馳驛奏聞。殘忍虐害辛於此，而以爲「如此樂事」，寗有人心。然神武（髙歡）子孫多淫暴好殺戮，家風如此，何以得久。故髙綽爲後主所殺。後主自爲周武帝（宇文邕）所獲，並任城王已下三十三，皆賜死，自是神武，子孫，存者一二，天鑒不遠，非無感應，善惡到頭終有報，殆亦因果律之有必然歟！</p>
<p>世人談端午　子，五色桃繩，皆謂爲屈原而作，其說本諸結齊諧記。</p>
<p>一　原以五月五日投汩雜而死，楚人哀之，每於此日，以竹簡貯米，投水祭之。漢建武中，長沙區回，白日見一人，自稱三問大夫，謂回日：聞君常見祭，甚善；但常年所遺，並爲蛟龍所竊，今若有惠，可以練楡葉塞，上以五色絲轉縛之，此物蛟龍所憚。回依其言。世人五月五日作　，並帶五色絲及練葉，皆汨羅之遺風。」</p>
<p>余謂此說若信，亦僅可謂爲吳楚間之於端午爲然；而何以咸稱爲賞端陽，賞者，賞心樂事之謂也，並有稱之爲人節，於以知其爲不盡然。且古史中往往於重五日，置酒髙會，不但見之於唐，如開元中，五月五日宴武成殿，賜羣臣襲衣，特以紫服金魚錫李元絃及蕭嵩，羣臣無與比。又不僅唐時已如此，即前於唐者亦如此，北史崔臣倫傳云：</p>
<p>一巨倫爲葛榮所留，欲用爲黃門郎，巨倫心惡之。五月五日，榮會集官寮，令巨倫贈詩，巨倫乃曰：</p>
<p>五月五日時天氣已大熱狗便呀欲死牛復喘吐舌以此自晦得免。」</p>
<p>而況唐之後如遼，亦復如是：「五月重五日午時，採艾葉和綿著衣七事，以奉天子，北南臣僚，各賜三事，君臣宴樂。渤海膳夫進艾糕，以五綵絲爲索纏臂，謂之合歡結。又以綵絲宛轉爲人形，簮之，謂之長命綫。」</p>
<p>金並於重五中元重九日行拜天之禮，禮畢，射柳擊毬以爲樂。現下毯藝盛行，茲述其擊毬法。</p>
<p>「擊毬，各乘所常習馬，持鞠，丈丈長數尺，其端如偃月。分其衆爲兩隊，共爭擊一毬。先於毬塲南立雙桓，置板，下開］孔爲門，而加網爲，能奪得鞠，擊入網囊者爲勝·或兩端對立二門，互相排擊，各以出門爲勝。毬狀小如拳，以輕靱木枵其中，而朱之，旣畢賜宴，歲以爲常。」</p>
<p>此皆爲五月五日陸上之宴樂，宋則並爲競渡之戲·</p>
<p>「宋眞宗咸平三年五月，幸金明池，觀水戲，揚旗鳴鼓，分左右翼，植木繫彩，以爲標識，方舟疾進，先至者賜之。移幸瓊林苑，登露台，奏樂，台下百戲競集，從者皆醉。」</p>
<p>宋髙宗紹興年間，每逢端午，輒賜臣寮及金使等扇帕，山此可見端午固以欣賞爲事，若曰吊屈原，聊備一說耳。</p>

<h3>化驗室裏</h3>
<p>— 雲</p>
<p>化驗室裏這幾天工作又忙不少檢騐的東西，尿，大便，痰，血，膿，其他體水。這許多五顏六色的美麗寶貝貨，實一在是我們重要的村料。</p>
<p>主任還沒來，我先拿尿來化騐吧，這常做的比較熱手些</p>
<p>你不要小看了這些東西，打翻了就眞比死還難過，好意思又向病人要份來嗎？這個［謹愼工作］的責仟是要絕對遵守着穿的好。白手術衣，這裏是散播各種病菌的小戰塲，我們寗頭相信敵方是殘酷無情，而不要以爲自已是萬靈之主，大意所至，那就糟了。</p>
<p>你以爲尿一律是黃色的嗎？要是十幾瓶放在一排，你看跟馬路上小販賣的顏色冰汽水不一樣嗎？淡黃，橘黃，徵紅的，褐色，草綠色，紅，黑，乳白色，白。但不能獻惡它的氣味，必須用手揮　下嗅嗅看　，再倒出放在量杯裏測量一下比重，愈重愈不妙。尿裏的花樣實在不少哩，滴最後一滴沉澱的尿放在玻璃片上到顯微鏡裏看去，白血球紅血球究竟有多少，腎管型，，圓柱狀體，粘絲，上皮細胞，寄生蟲有沒有。結晶體最有趣，有像埃及的金字塔，像女人所愛的玲瓏的水鑽。原來那不過是尿酸，草酸，磷酸鹽。碳酸鈣等等。</p>
<p>再來一個定性檢驗，放些</p>
<p>化學藥品，檢騐有無醋　，雙醋酸，尿膽素，膽色質，甚至一於還有鉛，水銀，砒。</p>
<p>假若病人的尿都能檢出糖質來，我們當可設一糖舖，發售甜糖。這當然是笑談，糖尿病是多麼痛苦呀！有時病人指明要檢騐有無蛋白質，這對於他的腰子（腎臟）是可悲了，有的話，得好好地洽療。</p>
<p>主任上班後，工作不免緊張。</p>
<p>檢騐血液了，先做血色素的百分比，又是顯微鏡下數紅血球總計多少，白血球總計多少，再做玻璃片上的區別計算：嗜中性總數，淋巴球總數，單核球總數，血小板數。不正常的就會發現了病理的紅血球白血球，色素過少，或　疾原蟲，或回歸熱螺旋體。我們料一想那位病患者正什發髙熱，或皮膚發黃，冷得打抖。</p>
<p>此外血族檢査，用弱擴大接物鏡檢査其血球與已知的血消混合後視其凝集現象，並記錄其結果，於是有O型，A型，B型，AB型之別，A型可以接血。此中唯有O型是福氣人，他（或她）可以輸血給任何血型的人，也可以接受仟何血型的血給自己而不受限制。其他不同血型要接受異血型，那麼像炸彈遇了火，頃刻同歸於盡，準有性命之憂。在歐美，他們差不多每人都去檢查過自己的血型，方便多了。</p>
<p>血液又有做康氏反應或瓦氏反應，道在都市裏很用得着，它專爲檢查害梅毒病的人而設。有的夫妻要鬧離婚，往往指對方有這個病，也有雇奶媽不放心她的健康，也有爲着便利診斷起見，於是我們得檢査一番了。那在靜脈管抽取的100、0血液，　天來不及做，就得放在電器冰箱裹冰着。爲着這番手續相當繁重，除了取出凝結的血塊之後，還得放在離心機裹搖十分鐘，單祇要血淸，於是紫銅架上的玻璃管出這一排到那一排，得分數次的混合，吸取，震搖，保溫，到末了做成了，我們就叫出一聲陽性反應！或陰性反應！</p>
<p>大便的生意，半多是小兒照顧我們，爲了好吃零食吧，我們却也巴不得在其中多找尋幾只　片蟲卵或蛔　卵等等，似乎很有興趣似的。</p>
<p>痰裹面亂匕八糟，肉眼看它不過是一塊濃黃痰，或淸水似的白沫，你上了藥斜，在顯微鏡下一看，眞會嚇一跳。一些空氣中的灰塵，形成幾把亂一稻草放在汚泥堆裏似的，移動着玻璃片再看，有流行性感冒桿菌，這倒不緊要，不幸的又發現不少ＴＢ（肺癆菌）小桿子似的，在那草堆裏橫一根直一根，挾雜些許的血球，這鬼東西正不知奪取多少人間的［成就」呢！</p>
<p>培養細菌該是最神聖的工作了。汗流着是不管的，窗門緊閉，更不得留一只飛蟲在內。各人要坐就坐着，要站就站着，空氣絕對保持不流動體，把要培養的病菌（膿上的，其他體水的）輕搽在培養基上，二十四小時後，從保溫器箱中取出，同樣得使空氣不流動，那玻璃器裏的培養基上早己育滿了其惡無比，呑取人類生命的病菌了。我們有時是培養着傷寒菌了，或白喉菌，敗血病的膿鏈球菌，淋菌，及其他病菌。當廢棄牠們的時候，即實行嚴厲的消毒法以毀減之。</p>
<p>輕快的要算替山羊，荷蘭小猪抽血的事了（取抗毒素用　。）山羊最乖，二句好話，就溫柔地躺下，隨便我們擺佈。小豬始終不服，哼號不己，非得用酒精灌醉了不行，其實也要不了幾十滴。</p>
<p>有時我們像廚子大司務一樣，任切新鮮牛肉，血紅的猪肺，大塊的猪肝，磅後，放上洋菜，煮了又蒸，消毒裝瓶，原來這又是製大量的培養基，以備隨時應用。</p>
<p>隨着份份檢騐報吿害發出後，一天已完畢了，拖着疲倦的身子，離開化騐室。</p>

<h3>我害了肺病　—生活之另一面—</h3>
<p>— 羅沉</p>
<p>醫生說我的肺病已經是第二期了。</p>
<p>前天自由談上一位朋友說：假如你害了肺病，別急！但是，這怎樣能使我不急啊？</p>
<p>別急？－是的，我知道雖然在今天醫界還沒有發明什麼肺病的完全對症藥，但人們對肺病已經不是毫無辦法的了。我知道我得吃魚肝油，我知道我得注射鈣劑，我知道我得吃牛奶，鷄蛋，牛肉湯，我知道我得好好地靜養……但是這一切怎麼能够呢？</p>
<p>每天，我得早起，我得步行半小時到學校去。你說：［爲什麼不乘車？步行會使你的病更糟的。」但是你知道電車又漲價了嗎？我不　不能承車，一到校，我得啞漪喉嚨從早到晚，整整地吊上八小時的嗓子。小學生們叫囂着，吵鬧着，使你一刻不能安神。一方面，還得覷校長先生的臉色。每回，我看見學生們活躍的樣子，我傷感－若是再讓我回到那無牽無掛無憂無慮的童年，該多麼好啊！</p>
<p>回家，完全精疲力盡了，我咳着。胸部感着隱痛。瞧瞧鏡子，我發覺自己一天天在消瘦下去了。突出的顴骨上，顯出兩朶肺病的紅暈。我怕！我丟了鏡子，把頭埋在手掌裏－啊！我害肺病了！癆病鬼！</p>
<p>休息一下吧！我對自己說再拖下去不得了呢！我去找醫生·醫生埋怨地說；你為什麼不早來？如果你早來兩個月，事情要好辦得多！是的，我爲什麼不早來？哦不，我爲什麼要來啊？我明知我害了肺病，兩個月前－三個月前我也知道我一定害了肺病，我爲什麼要找醫生啊？醫生當然說，別急，好好休養！對了，休養把！但是，一回家，就看看著妻苦喪的臉子，孩子們張着嘴，吵鬧着，餓喲！</p>
<p>別急？我怎麼能不急？我得吃魚肝油，但是孩子們要吃飯啊！</p>

<h3>萬人奴</h3>
<p>— 呂樹輝</p>
<p>（一）我是酒樓侍應生</p>
<p>人，一個人，生存在世界上，大概像前人說的：「大木的一葉，太倉的一粟」吧？然，照這樣看來，人也是挺渺小的，也許會始終沒有曉得有這麼一粟，一葉的存在－倘或那個人能給世界認識。能在史錄上現；那末，他就算是一個不平凡的任－不平凡的一棄，一粟。但，怎麼才會給世界人士發現你，而能千古留名呢？這些「登龍術」我可不知道，但怎樣才能給社會人們腦海洗去了你的影子，或要做一個平凡庸碌的人，使他們簡直不知有你，那我不辱命地回覆你：（請你去做酒樓的侍應生罷！」</p>
<p>「怎麼，侍應生不是種優良的職業，眞的永遠不會給社會人們認識發現嗎？你不免太看輕了他們吧！」也許會有人這樣驚奇地在質問我。但，可憐！我並沒看輕了他們和沒看輕了我自己一樣。這也許是旁觀者淸，但我們底生活，環境，　非非局中人」所能了解的啊！</p>
<p>在酒家裏，你想做一個「食威，識食，練精（假聰明），學懶（這是酒樓行的口頭禪）底人，那倒容易得很，正是「欲學楚國語，須到楚國去」的了，但你想在酒樓裏學出一個「狀元」來也許有一兩個會世界馳名的，而以前的確是敢說未聞的。</p>

<h3>五人腳踏車</h3>
<p>— 張喬</p>
<p>上海的腳踏車，眞是五花八門，無奇不有。可是五人脚踏車却像是還沒聽說過，這眞也可說是強中更有强中手；世界之大，光怪陸離的東西，原也多得很。這種五人脚踏車，事實上是三部脚塔車配合而成，五人騎一部脚踏車總是辦不到的事呀。這三部脚踏車中有一部是有前後座的。這樣便有了四個座位，另一人坐在前排當中的舵手位子上。四個人駛駕脚踏車，一個人掌管方向的變換，但不知這種新奇的車子，會不會在上海灘上出現呢</p>

<p>有時我們從一個人的錯誤所學得的比他的德行所學得的爲多。</p>

<p>動物</p>
<h3>跳舞鼠</h3>
<p>— 棟康</p>
<p>跳舞鼠是種奇怪的動物，牠的生理和普鼠類類一樣的。牠們跳起舞來，是找圓的圈子圍繞着轉，轉得很快，時問也很大，大概幾分鐘的樣子，有時豎起腳來跳幾跳，或是轉大圓圈子。在牠轉圓子的地方有阻擋物，不會阻止牠的不跳，牠換個地方，繼續跳下去。跳舞鼠的繼續性很大，即使跳出了籠，因爲停歇一會牠又嬰跳舞，人們就可以再捕捉回來。</p>
<p>美國生物學家海倫狄根做了一個實驗，他把數代野鼠雜交了，生殖了幾只跳舞鼠。在此之前，這生物學家培養了數代白鼠，總共有五千只，可是沒有一隻會跳舞的。現在，在牠們的同一代中，共有七十四個兄弟，兩隻是雄的，一隻是會跳華爾滋的雌鼠。</p>
<p>雄的跳舞鼠性格很暴躁，易和司類毆鬥。雌的則比較溫柔，可以和同性鼠類安居，但如果有生疏的跳舞鼠混進範來，就一致殺死來鼠。牠們的生殖力很弱，生殖的時期也短。</p>
<p>跳舞的食量很大，即使牠們後代不會跳舞的老鼠，食量也大過普通的鼠類。有一種患有神經質的跳舞鼠，食量更大，要飲多量的水。前脚時常做同樣的動作，循環不已，品性和跳舞的鼠很相似。</p>

<h3>神妙的臭氧</h3>
<p>— 史東</p>
<p>臭氧和氧氣與水蒸氣並存於遮蓋地球表面方圍　百四十哩的氣帶中。倘使我們沒有這三種氣體的話，地球上的溫度將趨對極端，以至夏季使我們熱死，而冬季使我們凍死。</p>
<p>臭氧發揮最大效用的是在離地球表而七十哩至一百哩的地方。在這裏它形成一種隔層，吸收太陽所發出的紫外錢，以免它們用全力照耀我們。倘使紫外錢不經過這隔層，而用全力照耀着我們，那麼我就不會在這裏寫這篇東西，你也不會在這裏讀它了！</p>
<p>可是我們的朋友臭氧卻幹着二重工作。它一方面阻止熱力直照耀地球，他方面又阻止遇多量的溫度從地球逃避。倘使溫度可以從地球自由逃避，那麼太陽經洛山，氣溫就將驟形降落到零下數白度。</p>
<p>在從事這重大的工作中，臭氧有一個很好的幫手，那就是灰塵。凡是臭氧的隔層所不能吸收的紫外綫則由灰塵濾下，以便使我們獲得適中的熱度它同時又節制雲的行動和水蒸發。</p>
<p>倘使沒有塵埃從中阻碍，水蒸氣將被大量吸收於空氣之中，使河川，湖澤及海洋皆陷於乾涸。於是這大量的水將猛力地落在大地上，引起巨大的水災，而我們都將淹死死了。</p>

<p>玫瑰花的顏色最美麗，最甜蜜，然而牠有銳利的刺，叫人愛而又不容易拿到。詩人說：玫瑰是愛情的象徵，是冉確切也沒有了。無刺的玫瑰會經爲園藝家夢想了數百年而尙未得到。新近已由美國康介狄克州的園藝家葛利設法培植成功。他已經因此而獲得玫瑰種植專家的榮譽。這種奇特的玫瑰是在一年前偶然發現的。現在把牠的嫩芽接在別種玫瑰的根上。然後把牠放在溫暖而不漏氣的培養器內歷六個星期，再把牠移植在花房內盆的土中，待它長大</p>

<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（六）一彈指</p>
<p>維城着生身之母是沒有了，嬸娘便是母親，母親不願意自己去做道件事，自已偏要去做，實在太說不過去。他望着嬸娘的臉，又望着母親的遺像，不忍再提要往上海去了。他從這一天起，定了一張日常功課表，把寫日記，看書，寫字，巡視　畝間，幾項必修科，注了上去。巡視　畝間，就是察看田裹的農作物，他在巡視時間，不是往東遙望，便是往西遙望。往西，是他所繫念的人在西方，望天上的雲，這片雲，也許便是在國芳和翠珍姊她們頭上。往東，是翠珍要歸來，那一定從東邊來的。</p>
<p>過了兩天，翠珍回來了，維城正在寫日記，他聽到聲音，連忙放了筆迎出來，又自己走在前面，引道着她進去。葉二太太喜鵲，何媽，都圍住了她問話。維城看翠珍的臉、比出去時白晳了，連站着，坐着，都改了樣子。桌子上放着她帶回來的罐頭食物，和五磅裝的餅乾。他在想，這些東西，不用說，是國芳送的了，國芳自己歡喜吃餅乾糖，她以己度人也就想得着送人這些東西。耳朶裏忽然聽得嬸娘在說：「你再不回來，城弟要到上海來找你了，他天天惦記着你。「一句話倒像提醒了維城，也就是給予了他和翠珍談話的機會，忙問道：「翠珍姊，你是坐了張樹榮的船回來的嗎？」翠珍道：「是的。陳小姐親自送我到碼頭上，還送了許多東西，這回倒是花了不少錢。今天船到的遲，到了花港，張樹榮要把船送我回來，我說不過上海去了一回，那裏便這般嬬嫩起來。他又要幫我拿東西，我也不要，便走回來了。陳小姐還不讓我走，要等城弟出來接我，我說城弟出來了，二伯母更冷靜，我倒是不願意出來。」維城道：「翠珍姊在上海住了幾天？」翠珍道：「有七八天了，我天天想回來。」葉二太太催着琴珍去吃飯，把姊弟倆的話頭打斷。（一〇五）</p>

<h3>Reorganization of Japanese Coastal Defense Force to Ensure Coastal Security</h3>
<p>Tokyo, Seventeenth, Allied News Agency Telegram: The Japanese coastal defense ships defending the coast have been old-fashioned battleships and cruisers. According to the revised Ship Ordinance promulgated on the 17th, coastal defense ships will now be a separate category, so that they can engage in true coastal defense missions. Therefore, several new special coastal defense ships have been built to form a coastal defense force to ensure the safety of coastal defense. The existing coastal defense ships are battleships and cruisers such as "Asama", "Irizumo", "Azuma", "Izumo", and "Iwashimizu".</p>

<p>Manila, Sixteenth, Central News Agency Telegram: In the past, senior Philippine government officials often held concurrent positions as directors of state-owned companies and received additional salaries.

<h3>Potash in the Dead Sea</h3>
<p>The Dead Sea in Palestine, its water surface is 1,289 to 1,300 feet lower than the Mediterranean Sea, is the lowest level in the world, with an area of 340 square miles, and the water contains extremely rich potash. If a person swims in the Dead Sea, he can float without sinking, but this sea water must never get into the eyes, otherwise he will go blind, which is nothing more than the potash element playing tricks. Workers who refine potash must wear long leather boots to protect their skin from injury.</p>
<h3>German Troops in Libya Brave Sandstorms to Intensify Encirclement of Tobruk. Armored Forces Approach El Adem</h3>
<p>Berlin, Sixteenth, Havas News Agency Telegram: The local radio station announced that although sandstorms are fierce on the North African front, the German-Italian Allied Forces are still making progress. The important positions of the British army west and northwest of El Adem have been destroyed after fierce fighting, so the British army has withdrawn to the north. Our army has also occupied the area north of Acroma and cut off the British army's retreat. In addition, our air force is also extremely active. Although the weather in North Africa is bad, our aircraft still sortied to bomb the enemy's mechanized forces on the road to Bardia.</p>
<p>Swiss Capital, Seventeenth, Allied News Agency Telegram: In Libya, the German army used its superior tanks and firepower, and the British army, under the able command of General Neame, has been forced to retreat to the outer perimeter of Tobruk's two major strongholds, one being El Adem and the other being Acroma, and is still pursuing with all its strength. After a new offensive of two days, it has approached El Adem, which is located 20 miles south of Tobruk. General Ritchie, the British commander in Tobruk, has sent an urgent message to the Middle East Command Headquarters, requesting reinforcements to boost the morale of the Eighth Army defending Tobruk. The two armies have been fighting fiercely since the night before. Fortunately, the British Eighth Army has been replenished and its defense line has not been broken. The South African 1st and 15th Divisions, which are holding the salient south of Gazala, have also not been cut off. The Battle of Libya has been going on for 18 days, and the British army has retreated from the Gazala to Bir Hakeim front line to a new defense line, which runs from Acroma through El Adem to the south. There is no trace of British troops west of Acroma.</p>
<p>Rome, Sixteenth, Havas News Agency Telegram: According to the Italian evening newspaper, the British army's failure in Libya is the most serious this time. It is estimated that six British divisions are surrounded in the Gazala area, and the two divisions defending Tobruk are also in danger of being annihilated. In addition, the "Piccolo Giornale" published an article by military commentator General Bratty, which briefly stated that the Italian-German Allied Forces' great victory in Libya was due to the rapid advance after occupying Bir Hakeim, and the British army's strategic errors were also a factor, because the British army was confident in its southern defense line and initially thought that it could hold firm.</p>
<p>Libyan Border Area, Sixteenth, Havas News Agency Telegram: The German-Italian Allied Forces in North Africa achieved a surprising victory, connecting Gazala and Tobruk to the Mediterranean coast.</p>
<p>British Troops in Gazala Isolated</p>
<p>The situation is roughly as follows: After the fall of Bir Hakeim, the southern base of the British army's first line of defense was controlled by the German army. The German army then advanced simultaneously in the northeast and northwest directions. A part of its armored division advanced towards Knightsbridge, turned towards Acroma, and from there reached the coast. As a result, the British army in the Gazala area was isolated, and the southwest and south of Tobruk were also threatened. At the same time, the second batch of German armored troops also attacked El Adem and advanced towards the town of Retzegg, which was occupied by the British army, in order to coordinate with the German army in the Knightsbridge area. The British army is now planning to withdraw the vanguard troops currently fighting at Knightsbridge and Acroma in order to deploy a new position on the line through El Adem and Gobi, and then continue to resist. However, it is expected that the German army will give full play to the results of the battle and take rapid action to prevent the British army from regrouping. From now on, the army will intensify its encirclement of Tobruk and launch an all-out attack on Egypt.</p>
<p>Cairo, Sixteenth, Havas News Agency Telegram: The Middle East Command Headquarters of the British Army announced today that General Ritchie had withdrawn the South African 1st Division and the British 5th Division from the south of Gazala. The enemy army attacked repeatedly on the 14th of this month, but was repelled by our armored divisions. When the British army withdrew, the armored troops assisted in attacking the enemy's left and right wings. At the same time, British aircraft were also extremely active, bombing the enemy army in the El Adem area and destroying several enemy aircraft in air battles. In addition, British aircraft also bombed Heraklion and Timbaki in Crete.</p>
<p>German Side Admits Fighting Is Difficult</p>
<p>Berlin, Seventeenth, Huitong News Agency Telegram: War correspondent Hellion reported from the North African front yesterday that the climate there is hot, water is scarce, and there are strong sandstorms, making the army's situation very difficult. The lack of drinking water causes the soldiers the greatest pain. They fight in the hot sun, their faces are stained with dust, and their eyes are red and swollen. Most people regard cold water as a gift. Each soldier has a limited amount of water, which is only enough to keep them from dying of thirst. The enemy troops are often affected as well. The wind and sand are also fierce. Sometimes the surroundings are surrounded by dense sand, making it difficult to distinguish objects. Fine sand particles can be said to penetrate everywhere. People's eyes, ears, noses, and mouths are often invaded by sand particles, which is very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Berlin, Seventeenth, Huitong News Agency Telegram: German military experts declared that after the Axis forces in North Africa reached the Mediterranean coast and cut the British army in Gazala into two parts, their transportation lines have been greatly shortened and their supply situation has been greatly improved, while the British supply has encountered extremely difficult problems. The British escort fleet in the Mediterranean Sea has been difficult to maintain, and the enemy's repair work has also been greatly affected. The heavy losses of the enemy's armored units and the difficulty of repair work have severely damaged the enemy's strength. The temperature in the area is usually between 33 and 55 degrees Celsius at noon, and there are often strong winds along the coast, which stir up sand and dust, making combat very difficult.</p>
<p>British Troops Ambushed West of Knightsbridge</p>
<p>Stockholm, Seventeenth, Huitong News Agency Telegram: The London Times quoted a reporter in Cairo as saying that a British tank convoy operating in Marmarica was lured to the west of Knightsbridge. Just as a strong sandstorm made visibility poor, it fell into the Axis army's ambush. The enemy's German and Italian flat-fire guns and artillery concentrated their bombardment, and shells fell like rain. The British army was caught off guard, and the formation was scattered. The tank drivers were blinded by the sandstorm, which made the vehicles move very slowly. Fortunately, they were able to escape, but they had already suffered losses.</p>
<p>Ankara, Seventeenth, Huitong News Agency Telegram: According to news received here, the battle for the crossroads set up at Knightsbridge has been going on for several weeks. Now the British defense forces have withdrawn. Knightsbridge is located west of El Adem in Cyrenaica.</p>
<h3>Ciano Meets with Suner in Lake Heng. Significance of Suner's Visit Aims to Consolidate Friendship Between Two Countries</h3>
<p>Rome, Sixteenth, Havas News Agency Telegram: All parties here unanimously welcomed the Spanish Foreign Minister Suner's visit to Thailand and considered the visit to be of great significance, such as the "Telegram News" which stated that Italy and Spain were fraternal countries. During the Spanish Civil War, they fought side by side on the battlefield, and Fascist Italy fully understood the wishes of Spain. The Spanish Foreign Minister also knew this very well.</p>
<p>Rome, Seventeenth, Huitong News Agency Telegram: Spanish Foreign Minister Dr. Suner inspected the naval school in Livorno, and the city hung flags to welcome him. Italian newspapers emphasized that Suner's meeting with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano was very harmonious.</p>
<p>Rome, Seventeenth, Huitong News Agency Telegram: The attention of the political circles is focused on the Spanish Foreign Minister Suner, who is currently visiting Italy. A few days ago, it was rumored that Suner's visit was purely of a private nature, but this has now been proven to not be entirely the case. Yesterday morning, the newspapers published an official bulletin of Suner's arrival here, but it did not mention that Suner's visit was of a private nature, so it is believed that it may contain political significance. The "Piccolo Newspaper" published a political commentary on Suner's visit to Italy yesterday afternoon, stating that "the friendship between Italy and Spain, which was built on the battlefield, will last forever and will never be destroyed. Suner's visit to Italy is enough to consolidate the friendship between the two countries and unite these two major Latin countries to work together to build a new Europe." The newspaper pointed out the significance of choosing Lake Heng as the meeting place, saying that Lake Heng has the spirit of ancient times and the ambition of modern times. In addition, the city is the birthplace of the Italian navy, and the Italian naval officers and soldiers who were trained in Lake Heng have now defeated the largest naval country in the world in the Mediterranean Sea. The "Italian Voice" obtained news from Lake Heng that the spirit of the meeting between the Spanish and Italian Foreign Ministers was extremely harmonious.</p>
<h3>Spanish Youth Front Sends Representatives to Visit Germany and Italy Separately</h3>
<p>Madrid, Sixteenth, Havas News Agency Telegram: The Spanish "Youth Front" recently sent two groups of representatives, one to Weimar, Germany, to participate in the European Youth Congress, and the other to Florence, Italy, to participate in an art competition. Both groups are scheduled to depart for Berlin tonight.</p>
<h3>Pétain's Second Anniversary in Power; Issues Proclamation to the People, Urging Them Not to Be Selfish and to Place Faith in the Fate of the Country; Expresses Patriotic Devotion to the People with Sorrow</h3>
<p>Vichy, Seventeenth, Havas News Agency Telegram: Marshal Pétain has been in power for two years and issued a proclamation to the people today, saying, "French people, on June 17, 1940, when our country requested a ceasefire in a tragic situation, I tried to persuade the people to restrain their grief and place their faith in the fate of our country. One year later, on June 17, 1941, I again told you that the task is heavy and the road is long. Today, I can only encourage you with these words. In today's world, wars are everywhere, and France stands in the middle of it. Prosperity and decline are both possible. Even if there is sadness, it is not worth mentioning. Our country is gradually extricating itself. Although it is extremely painful, the decision made two years ago is of great significance. The possibility of our country's material and spiritual revival is pregnant here. The response to my appeal from all parties has been very weak, and I do not want to hide it. It is also true that the government's actions have not been without errors. For example, food is insufficient, resulting in unfair distribution, and speculators have not been brought to justice. It is also human nature that workers suffer and become passive. The people of the whole country are impatient, and the duties of mayors of cities are too heavy, and there is a trend of accumulating problems. Do you think that restoring the old methods can be more helpful? In addition to the shortcomings of the country, are not the greed and selfishness of many French people related to the failure of various efforts? Is it not against injustice, unkindness, and the power of money to corrupt personality that the resentment and dissatisfaction among the people are increasing rather than decreasing? I am very sad because of these things, but in view of the tragic situation of the people today, these things are even more abominable. On the day after our defeat in the war, I saw that many French people failed to fulfill their duties, but I did not lose faith because of this. Fatigue, negligence, and condemnation cannot deter me. On the contrary, the smiles of infants, the tenderness of mothers, and the vitality of young people are enough to restore my courage. One or two years have passed since the armistice. In these two years, hope and disappointment, instability and various sacrifices have come one after another. Is this not the path that a wounded France, a blind France, must take to grope for its fate? My France will have a day of prosperity, and I am convinced of this. Dear compatriots, please eliminate fear and resentful criticism in your hearts, and think of the leaders who love you. The leaders are still standing with you in the storm, countless prisoners are still far away from you, your fields disappoint you, your factories work slowly, and your families are still suffering from hunger and cold. Your leaders will never forget all of this. They wish that on the anniversary of one of the most tragic weeks in our country's history, you would all have great hope to save our country. Long live France!"</p>
<h3>Czech Workers Hold Meeting</h3>
<p>Prague, Seventeenth, Huitong News Agency Telegram: Last night, more than 60,000 Czech workers gathered in Pilsen to hold a mass meeting. Propaganda Minister Moravec attended and delivered a speech, explaining the great significance of fighting for the construction of a new Europe. He briefly stated that if Germany failed this time, 400 million people in Europe would suffer from famine and starvation. Britain would turn a blind eye to this and would not provide assistance. After the politicians of the democratic countries handed over Europe to the Bolsheviks, they would still impose a blockade on Europe. The duty of every Czech today is to actively eliminate harm for the country. The murderer who assassinated the German Deputy Commissioner is not a hero, but a traitor to the entire nation. Our goal is very clear, that is, to fight against England side by side with Germany. The German leader is the leader of the German workers and the new Europe. I pay tribute to him here.</p>
<h3>Forty-Nine Czechs Executed Again in Group</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sixteenth, Havas News Agency Telegram: According to news from the capital, regarding the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, the German administrative head of the Czech Protectorate, twenty-three people were sentenced to death, including fifteen in Prague and eight in Brno. All were executed yesterday for harboring murderers, failing to report information, and being hostile to Germany. In addition, the Czech Minister of Agriculture delivered a radio address to the farmers yesterday, requesting the people to assist the authorities in arresting the murderer.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Seventeenth, Havas News Agency Telegram: Czech Capital Radio announced this morning that after the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, the acting administrative head of the Czech Protectorate, another twenty-six Czechs were executed en masse. The number of people executed in this case has now reached 450.</p>
<p>Prague, Seventeenth, Huitong News Agency Telegram: The Czech people regarded Jews, half-Jews, and "Rule Members" and demanded that they be held hostage. The Germans dared to take a cautious attitude and did not approve.</p>
<h3>Four Ukrainians Also Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Fifteenth, Havas News Agency Telegram: The Berlin correspondent of the Swedish Daily Newspaper recently reported that the special court in Brest-Litovsk, a city in the Polish occupied area, recently sentenced four Ukrainians to death. Two of them were Jews and one was a shoemaker, all of whom were guilty of conspiracy to sabotage. One farmer was guilty of assassinating a Greek Orthodox priest. In addition, an employee in the capital of Estonia was also sentenced to death for stealing clothes from the hospital.</p>
<h3>Captured Free French Will All Enter Special Camps</h3>
<p>Berlin, Sixteenth, Havas News Agency Telegram: The person in charge recently said that the soldiers of the Free French Forces captured by the German army in North Africa will be sent to special camps, placed under confinement, and treated as prisoners of war. In accordance with international practice, Germany's adoption of this measure is sufficient to show the broad-mindedness of the Axis Powers. According to previous reports, Germany will treat these "Free French" as "plainclothes soldiers" in accordance with the armistice agreement.</p>
<h3>Jerusalem Police Chief Seriously Injured in Assassination</h3>
<p>Milan, Havas News Agency Telegram: An Italian newspaper recently reported that a British police chief in Jerusalem was seriously injured by a bomb thrown by Arab nationalists in a car. In addition, after the Iranian Revolutionary Party occupied Urmia, it arrested local Soviet political and military officials, sentenced them to death by hanging by the people's court, and executed them in public.</p>

<h3>The Battle for Sevastopol Port is in Full Swing; German Reinforcements Prevent Soviet Counterattack; Soviets Deploy Heavy Tanks Encountering Formidable Opponents</h3>
<p>United Press, Bear City, 17th – The Germans have dispatched large forces and are using heavier artillery than in the First World War to attack the front lines at Kharkov and Sevastopol, preventing Soviet counteroffensives around those two locations. The siege of Sevastopol continues fiercely. Official reports state that German attacks on Kharkov and Sevastopol's defenses are proving arduous. According to recent battle reports, the 52-ton heavy tanks used by Soviet General Timoshenko in the Ukrainian offensive have encountered a fierce assault from General Bock's armored forces. In several areas, German forces have broken through the main force of the Soviet offensive and driven them back.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Somewhere on the Ukrainian Front, 16th – Over the past 24 hours, the battle for Sevastopol has been in full swing, with German pressure particularly intense in the southern sector. The German-Romanian forces, supported by strong artillery and tanks, reached the Black Sea coast one mile west of St. George's Monastery yesterday afternoon. The monastery was a strong Red Army fortress, and the German-Romanian forces only managed to capture it after a fierce hand-to-hand combat. This has shortened the battle line in the area by four miles. The Soviet fleet bombarded German positions along the Black Sea coast last night. It is rumored that several Soviet warships have recently arrived at Sevastopol Port from Novorossiysk and other ports in the Caucasus, presumably to protect the retreat of the defending troops. It is also noteworthy that the Red Army is dismantling various military facilities and warehouses in the port. In order to relieve the threat to Sevastopol, the Red Army has dispatched four infantry divisions, attempting to land in various locations near the port to attack the German rear. However, so far, these attempts have not been successful. As for other areas north of Sevastopol, the fighting is most intense east of Kharkov. German forces in that area have crossed the Donets River and continue to advance, crushing the Red Army near Rayhorodok. Elsewhere, German forces in Kereselk are also showing signs of activity, attempting to launch local offensives from the north and south of the city. In the Izium area, the fighting is at a stalemate, but important developments may occur soon.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Moscow, 16th – TASS issued a message today acknowledging that the pressure exerted by Axis forces on Sevastopol Port is increasing daily. The message stated: "Our situation is quite serious. Over the past two months, the German-Romanian forces have been reinforced with fresh troops and have been constantly attacking us fiercely. Therefore, bloody battles have broken out on both the northern and southern fronts." However, the Red Army's land and air forces are fighting bravely. The bodies of German-Romanian soldiers are scattered everywhere near Sevastopol Port. It is estimated that the German High Command has concentrated seven infantry divisions and 150 tanks in these two areas.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 17th – According to further details of the situation in the Sevastopol region released by the German High Command last night, the success of the German offensive on the Sevastopol front has forced the Soviet forces to resort to desperate measures, launching counterattacks by land and using warships. Therefore, the German Air Force's participation in the attack on Soviet warships in Sevastopol Port has been very successful. The German fleet off the coast of Yevpatoria, northwest of Sevastopol, repelled Soviet warships. Enemy attempts to land near Yalta, southeast of Sevastopol, and Mariupol on the Sea of Azov coast were unsuccessful.</p>
<h3>Soviet Troops are Duty-Bound to Defend the Land; Sevastopol Port is Like Hell</h3>
<p>United Press, Lisbon, 16th – German attacks on Sevastopol are becoming increasingly fierce. On the 15th, they sent another 500,000 troops to destroy several Soviet defense lines. The Soviet side has deployed the Black Sea Fleet to bombard the German rear. Both sides are currently engaged in intense fighting. According to a British Broadcasting Corporation broadcast on the 16th, German forces launched repeated fierce attacks on the fortresses south of Sevastopol on the 16th. Thousands of German aircraft were deployed, concentrating on bombing port facilities and Soviet positions. The artillery used long-range guns to bombard Soviet positions. Sevastopol Port is now a living hell, and the situation is extremely tragic. TASS and the Communist Party newspaper Pravda have also confirmed that Sevastopol is facing a major crisis and stated that Soviet troops should defend the port to the last man.</p>
<h3>German Forces Prepare to Launch Another Offensive Against Leningrad</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Stockholm, 16th – The "Aftonbladet" here recently reported that, according to reliable sources in Helsinki, the German High Command is preparing a large-scale offensive against Leningrad, as the Germans consider this important town to be a preliminary strategic objective.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Helsinki, 17th – The Finnish High Command stated yesterday that on Monday, the fighting on the land front was limited to exchanges of fire between reconnaissance units. Enemy warships were bombarded by our coastal artillery and sailed east towards Kronstadt Bay under the cover of smoke. In air combat south of the Svir River, our aircraft shot down two new-model enemy aircraft. All our aircraft returned safely to base. Yesterday afternoon, enemy aircraft bombed Lodeynoye Pole, killing two people and injuring ten others. There was also material damage. Other coastal areas issued air raid warnings due to enemy aircraft attacks, but no bombs were dropped.</p>
<h3>German Aircraft Active Everywhere, Bombing Soviet Transport Lines</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 17th – The authorities here stated last night that German aircraft bombed the Murmansk airfield on Monday, destroying two hangars. On the same day, Sevastopol was also heavily attacked by German dive bombers, which dropped countless bombs of various sizes. Fortress positions and road vehicles were destroyed. Supply lines, transportation, and garrisoned Soviet troops in other sections of the Eastern Front were also attacked by German aircraft. Several railroads in the central sector were bombed and cut off, and many trains and locomotives were severely damaged. A total of twelve enemy aircraft were shot down on Monday.</p>
<h3>German and Italian Naval and Air Forces Attack British Convoy; Germans Claim Great Victory; Italian Heavy Cruiser Sunk</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Fuehrer's Headquarters, 17th – The German High Command issued a special battle report last night stating that the cooperation of the German and Italian naval and air forces in attacking a heavily protected British convoy sailing from Alexandria has dealt a major blow to the British Navy and British shipping lanes. Between June 12th and 15th, the German and Italian naval and air forces sank four cruisers and destroyers, two patrol boats, and six merchant ships, totaling 56,000 tons. In addition, one destroyer and eight merchant ships were hit by torpedoes or bombs and caught fire, with the severity of the damage warranting inclusion on the list of losses. Furthermore, six warships and six merchant ships were also hit by torpedoes or bombs. A total of 33 escorting British aircraft were shot down, and ten German aircraft went missing. The remnants of the convoy were forced to turn back. German submarines, commanded by Vice Admiral Reichke, sank a British cruiser in this battle.</p>
<p>United Press, Rome, 16th – The Italian High Command announced the Mediterranean battle situation on the 16th, stating that the great naval and air battle in the Mediterranean ended last night. The Italian Navy and Air Force achieved great results. On the morning of the 15th, a naval force composed of two Italian light cruisers and five torpedo boats fiercely attacked a strong enemy convoy sailing from Gibraltar to Malta. The enemy convoy consisted of two cruisers, thirteen minesweepers, and several destroyers, which were numerically superior. However, after being attacked from all sides, they released smoke screens and scattered in all directions. Another battle occurred later, in which our cruisers sank one enemy cruiser and damaged two destroyers. They also launched torpedoes to attack and severely damage one enemy cruiser and one destroyer each. Our heavy cruiser was sunk by enemy aerial and underwater torpedoes. Although another torpedo boat was severely damaged, it safely returned to base. Our bombers and submarines attacked and severely damaged an enemy convoy sailing from Alexandria to Malta.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, 17th – According to London sources, the British side is maintaining silence on the Mediterranean convoy battle. The newspapers only publish official communiqués. The newspapers deny German and Italian reports of British ship losses. London insists that although the convoy was heavily attacked, it reached Malta and Tobruk. American long-range bombers assisted in attacking enemy ships.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Madrid, 17th – The ABC newspaper here commented on the great naval and air battle in the Mediterranean on Monday, stating that the Italian Air Force's great victory in the Mediterranean has added a glorious page to the history of the Axis war in North Africa. The actions of the Axis forces in North Africa have a pincer-like posture, but the hot climate in Libya seems not to have taken into account the occupation of Tobruk.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 17th – Last night, the German press prominently published news of the Axis victory in the Mediterranean and the situation on the North African front. German newspapers compared Churchill's optimistic remarks three weeks ago with the serious facts now revealed. The "Berliner Börsen-Zeitung" cited Churchill's statement a few days after the start of the North African campaign, stating that General Rommel's plan had completely failed and that he would therefore waste a large amount of manpower and resources. German newspapers believe that the destruction of the British convoy in the Mediterranean is directly related to the North African campaign. The "Berliner Börsen-Zeitung" stated that the damage suffered by the British convoy in the Mediterranean was so severe that they dared not mention it. The result of this has already affected the North African campaign. Britain can no longer use ostrich-like tactics to avoid the current facts.</p>
<h3>Allied Ships Sunk Four</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 16th – According to a Washington dispatch, the US Navy Department announced on the 16th that four United Nations ships had been sunk by Axis submarines off the US coast.</p>

<h3>Rumor Allied Nations will Issue Declaration Clarifying Post-War Political Intentions; Finland Expresses Concern About Anglo-Soviet Alliance</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Bern, Switzerland, 16th – Newspapers here recently quoted a correspondent in London as saying that the Allied nations will soon issue a declaration clarifying their political intentions after the current war ends. British newspapers have been commenting on this matter, but there has been no definite indication of what plans the Allied nations have for a peace organization. For example, the "Daily Express" recently published an article advocating a three-year transition period from the armistice agreement to the formal establishment of a peace treaty. This news is related to what British Minister of Information Bracken recently told foreign journalists that the first task after the war is to ensure that the people of all European countries have access to a large amount of food.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Helsinki, Finland, 16th – The recent alliance between Britain and the Soviet Union has been commented on by newspapers here, with particular emphasis on the possible impact on Finland. For example, the "Uusi Suomi" stated, "It is very possible that this treaty has supplementary secret clauses. In any case, its main parts must contain dangerous consequences that will cause concern among the people of our country. Britain's attitude towards the Soviet Union has been expressed in this treaty. In short, it is to fully respect Soviet demands." The "Suomen Sosialidemokraatti" also stated, "If the Soviet Union assumes the role of police after the war, all European countries, especially small ones, will be dissatisfied. Britain has always opposed the Soviet Union's annexation of Poland, the Baltic states, and Finland. The United States has also never recognized any changes in postwar borders. Fortunately, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's recent visit to Britain and the United States did not achieve his wishes. But one point is worth noting, that the Soviet Union is never bound by any treaty and only knows how to seize opportunities. Assuming that the treaty nations eventually win, how will the United States be able to prevent the Soviet Union from doing whatever it wants in the future? This is a question."</p>
<h3>Soviet Envoy Delegation Arrives in Mexico</h3>
<p>United Press, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 16th – According to a dispatch from Mexico, a Soviet military delegation led by Colonel-General Sazhin arrives from Washington in Mexico on the 15th.

<p>Havas News Agency, London, 16th – Authoritative sources here recently stated that Prime Minister Churchill's next broadcast address will focus on the coal issue and will call for national conservation.

The date of the speech will be June 28th, but it has not yet been fully confirmed.</p>

The picture shows the streets of Haifa, with high-rise buildings, busy traffic, and a dense population, which can be seen at a glance.</p>

<h3>Five · Random Talks About Egypt</h3>
<p>(Rural Sketches) The residents on both sides of the Nile River build earthen walls with gray soil. Upon entering a village, one feels cramped and the sounds are noisy. The voices of people and livestock intermingle, and cow dung is burned everywhere, with a unique rustic scent wafting in the air. Early in the morning, the streets are already bustling with noise. A donkey is tied to the entrance of the coppersmith's shop. The animal is naturally mischievous, constantly kicking with its hind legs. The owner is taking a roll of blue linen off the donkey's back, trying to sell it to the coppersmith. Coincidentally, the barber from the village, wearing slippers, leisurely runs over. The coppersmith once made a copper shaving basin for him, and now, not interested in buying the linen, introduces it to the barber. But the barber is quite pitiful, having shaved heads for a year and only received a basket of lentils in return, so where would he get the spare money to buy such fabric? A few children are chasing ducks to play with. The ducks run onto a pile of dry river mud, and the children chase after them, determined to catch them. A beggar rides a donkey and arrives, seeing a lot of people, he dismounts to beg. Counting the money he received, he remounts the old, pitifully thin donkey and mumbles away.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a sharp cry arises at one end of the street: a mule, carrying six times its weight in goods, knocks over a bucket of milk. It turns out the customer wants to personally watch the farmer milk the cow into the bucket to prevent her from adding water behind his back. Onlookers form a large circle, halting the street traffic for a long time. Following that, a tall camel, walking with its head held high, comes slowly, its humps tied with large and heavy bags of grain. The camel spots a clump of weeds by the side of the street, lowers its head, and chews leisurely, as impatient people around it make a racket. Amidst all the noise, another sound flies from the sky, it is the muezzin from the minaret of the mosque, reciting the second timed call of the day.</p>
<p>(Calculation of the Calendar) Because of the Nile's floods, Egyptians naturally divided the year into three parts: the flood season, the planting season, and the harvest season. The year was set to twelve months, and the month to thirty days. As such, there were always a few extra days each year, and after five hundred years, the original flood season became the harvest season. To correct this error, a recalculation was required: someone had already invented the calendar we use today six thousand years ago. One cannot but praise the greatness of the people of that era. The Egyptians not only made inventions regarding the calendar, but also gradually developed astronomy, geography, architecture, and painting. Even in terms of decoration, they knew how to use necklaces around the neck as early as two thousand years BC. Moreover, the exquisiteness of gemstone polishing and the delicacy of gold and silver inlays, the mystery of this technology, and how they used large blocks of stone to build the enormous pyramids, are all inexplicable to us modern people.</p>
<p>(The Pyramids - Products of Megalomania) The Nile River meanders north through Upper Egypt, vast and mighty, until it reaches Cairo, the largest city in Africa. The river surface is wide, and the current is smooth. The west bank is a vast green land, and the east bank has mountains as a barrier. The course of the Nile River ends here. Further north, it branches into a fragmented river network, which is the famous Delta.</p>
<p>Fifty miles from Cairo, six pyramids rise continuously in the green countryside. The light is very bright, and the mountains are low, making them very clear when viewed from the Nile. This is not a temple for idols, nor a symbol of power, nor is it for the enjoyment of life: the construction of the pyramids is entirely the product of the ruler's megalomania and fear of death, which led to the construction of these immortal architectural wonders.</p>
<p>Next to the pyramids, there is also a Sphinx. Half of the statue is buried in the sand. It is said that at one point, the entire statue was about to sink into the soil. Later, Prince Roma-something was taking a nap by the statue during a certain expedition, and the Sphinx appeared to him in a dream: "If you can excavate me and bring me into the world, I will help you become the king of Egypt." Later, it was buried by a great sandstorm due to the prince. Now, thousands of years later, like the pyramids, it has become a source of pride after excavation. At least it has not been eroded by the sun in the desert, and those seeking world curiosities can still admire and praise this ancient world heritage.</p>
<h3>Germany Expands Maritime War Zone, South American Countries Affected, Argentina Controls Axis Assets</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 16th (Havas) - After Germany decided to expand its submarine warfare zone to the American coast, government officials expressed concern, saying that most of Argentina's exports are directly shipped to the United States, and its main imports are also from the United States, making the relationship very important. It is heard that the trade volume between the United States and Argentina has decreased. Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Casia and German Charge d'Affaires Me Xiong held talks today to discuss this issue. As of now, apart from Me Xiong officially confirming Germany's decision, the authorities have not made any statements.

If this situation persists, Brazilian newspapers will be completely suspended within the next two months. In the past, Brazil published more than 800 newspapers, requiring 70,000 tons of paper annually. Now, at a minimum, 4,000 tons of paper must be imported monthly.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 16th (Havas) - The Argentine government today, in accordance with the resolution of the Pan-American Conference, that all countries in the Western Hemisphere should sever commercial and financial ties with the Axis powers, ordered the control of all Axis-owned factories and companies within the country, and dispatched a supervisory officer to reside in each company, controlling the company's finances and operations.</p>

<p>Bern, 17th (Haitong Agency) - In order to procure its own ships for maritime transport, the International Red Cross has established a fund management committee in Basel, which will entrust a certain Swiss shipping company to serve as manager.

All directors will be appointed from well-known figures in the legal and economic sectors. The first ship has already been purchased, named "Caritas I". The ship originally belonged to Belgium, has a displacement of 4,000 tons, and arrived in Lisbon from Casablanca on June 9, where it was formally handed over to the Red Cross after inspection. It is heard that the motivation for establishing the fund management committee to operate its own maritime transport is to enable prisoners of war and detained civilians in various locations to obtain the necessary assistance as soon as possible.</p>

In order not to lose the opportunity to collect the certificate and avoid delays, all taxpayers must carefully follow the above-mentioned procedures. Further details of the new rice distribution plan will be announced later.</p>
<p>Design and Content of the Rice Purchase Certificate</p>
<p>The Rice Management Office of the Municipal Council began dispatching a large number of staff at 9:00 AM yesterday to start arranging and dusting off the numbered household registration forms and the registered numbers of nearby rice shops. The arrangement and preparation of each sub-office will be completed by the 21st. Starting on the 22nd, rice purchase certificates will be issued. The design of the rice purchase certificate is long and narrow, divided into four sections from top to bottom. The first section indicates rice purchase for the first week, and so on. The words "Rice Purchase" are printed on the right end of each section, and a solid mark is stamped in the middle. The location of the retail rice shop is above, and the registration number of the rice shop is on the left end.</p>
<p>French Concession Divided into Six Police Districts</p>
<p>The new rice distribution method in the French Concession is as follows. As reported yesterday, the first rice purchase certificate will be issued at the following offices starting on Monday, June 22, 1942, based on the latest house tax receipt (May-June). The rice purchase certificates will be issued separately by each police district. The boundaries of each district and the locations of the offices issuing rice purchase certificates are listed below.</p>

<p>Liaisons and Heads of Households Assist in Notification</p>
<p>Hereby respectfully request that the owners of properties and heads of households must carefully remember their light section and the address of the office where they should go to collect the rice purchase certificate. At the appropriate time, the Liaison Officer or other means will notify the relevant persons of the address of the office and the date for collecting the rice certificate. Therefore, in order to avoid omissions and delays in issuing the rice certificate, it is hoped that the owners of properties and heads of households will strictly comply with the above methods.</p>
<p>Formal Rationing to Begin on July 6th</p>
<p>According to Datong reporters, the collection of this rice purchase certificate is limited to two weeks, so the date for implementing per capita rationing is scheduled to begin on Monday, July 6. In order to take parallel steps with the International Settlement, the French Concession has confirmed that it will also start on the same day. There are a total of 657 rice shops in the two concessions that have signed retail contracts with the Rice Management Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council, including 414 in the International Settlement and 243 in the French Concession. Each rice shop should prepare a wooden sign painted with the registration number, which has been completed and will be hung in a conspicuous place in each rice shop starting from July 1st.</p>
<p>New Rice Shops Temporarily Not Distributing Rice</p>
<p>The Rice Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council continued to designate the Taikoo Warehouse and the Zhejiang Xingye Warehouse yesterday as places for rice shops to pick up rice, totaling more than 10,000 bags. The foreign rice will still only be supplied to the original 372 rice shops in the two concessions. The additional 285 shops must wait until the per capita rationing is implemented on the 6th of next month to be allocated. The office also sent a letter to the rice shops yesterday, stating: "To whom it may concern, this office will be closed on Thursday, the 18th of this month. After the purchase order is paid today, the warehouse receipt should be picked up between 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM in the afternoon without fail."</p>
<h3>Some Stores Redefine Prices, Raising Prices Invisibly, the Public Should Report Immediately</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the most important price control regulations issued by the municipal authorities of the three districts in order to combat profiteering and hoarding took effect yesterday morning (July 17). Many members of the public are paying attention to changes in prices, and promptly report any violations to the authorities. It has been found that the International Settlement, the French Concession, and the Western District announced on Monday night that from yesterday morning until further notice, the retail prices calculated in savings certificates must not exceed half of the average price in old legal tender between May 26 and 28. This measure has taken effect, as some stores have removed price tags and redefined prices. Many unscrupulous merchants do not adjust the prices, but only add savings certificates to the original price, thus invisibly doubling the price. Only a few have actually lowered the old prices. The authorities issued a joint order, forcing merchants to set fair prices.</p>
<h3>Banking Industry Tightens Lending, Interest on Loans Set at 2.4% to 3%, Maximum Interest on Deposits is 1%</h3>
<p>Allied News Agency reports that the banking industry in the city previously had abundant floating capital, a surge in deposits, and a lack of investment in industry and commerce, resulting in wasted deposit interest and significant losses. Deposits have been withdrawn in large quantities, and most of the floating capital has been transferred to invest in industries. As a result, deposits in banks and native banks have gradually decreased. Now, since the implementation of the new currency, the cash reserves and all deposits and loans of various banks and native banks have been converted into reserve certificates at a ratio of two to one. It has now been decided to increase loan interest and reduce deposit interest. The loan interest is set at 2.4% to 3%, and the maximum deposit interest is 1%. According to this principle, each bank and native bank will handle it at their discretion.</p>
<h3>Trams in Both Concessions Still Use Old Subsidiary Currency, Using 10 Cents to Replace 5 Cents in Savings Certificates</h3>
<p>Public transport vehicles in both concessions have stopped accepting old legal tender since yesterday. However, trams and buses in the French Concession still accept old subsidiary currency, because the notice from the French Tram Company only prohibits the use of old legal tender of one yuan or more. As for the trams in the International Settlement, although the company authorities have announced that they will not accept any old legal tender, in fact, they still accepted 10-cent notes yesterday and often gave them to passengers as change. This is because the tram fare in the International Settlement has a fraction of 5 cents in savings certificates, and 5-cent savings certificates are not widely circulated, so the old 10-cent notes are temporarily used as a substitute.</p>

<h3>French Concession Household Registration Certificate to be Issued Soon, Identity Cards for Baojia Chiefs Being Filled Out</h3>
<p>The household registration survey in the French Concession has now been completed by the efforts of the Baojia chiefs in each liaison district. The household registration certificates have also been filled out by the police stations under the jurisdiction of each district. In order to permanently preserve the household registration certificates, the authorities have specially made a transparent plastic bag, which will be collected from each household at the wholesale price of four yuan in new currency, which must be paid to the Jia chiefs, so as to be paid to the Baojia Committee. As for the identity cards of the Baojia chiefs, each district police station has notified the liaison chiefs to quickly find out the names, ages, occupations, addresses, and places of birth of the Baojia chiefs under their jurisdiction and report them, so that identity cards can be issued.</p>

<p>An alarm bell is placed at the entrance of No. 9 Avenue Edward VII. Due to the continuous rain in recent days, the alarm bell has been slightly damaged. It suddenly rang at around 0:45 noon yesterday. After hearing the alarm, the police station immediately ordered a large number of detectives to rush to the above-mentioned location and surround it. After investigation, it was found that it was a misunderstanding, and they immediately returned by car. However, the nearby residents had already suffered a false alarm.</p>

<h3>Today is the Dragon Boat Festival: Settlement of Accounts in Various Industries; Banking and Market Industries are Closed for One Day</h3>
<p>Today is the Lunar Calendar's Dragon Boat Festival. Banking, commercial, and industrial sectors in the city are following custom to settle accounts for the festival. Dealings between various trades and debts owed by customers must be cleared. Representatives from various commercial and industrial firms are dispatched with final account notices, busily urging payment. However, because most industries have been dealing in cash this year, debts between trades are less than in previous years. Furthermore, it coincides with the implementation of the Currency Reserve System, making transfers busy. Tomorrow, the Public Works Department, the Shanghai branch of the Reserve Bank, all banking and money industries, and all market dark markets will take a day off and close.</p>
<h3>Bandits Form Gang: Falsely Claim Search</h3>
<p>Detectives from the Xinzha Police Station previously arrested criminals Chen Yushi, Cao Peng, Yin Yongda, Zhu Guozhang, Zheng Qian, and five others. They were taken to the police station for investigation. It was learned that these people, together with the four fugitives including Yang Yong, had, on the afternoon of the 1st of this month at 1:30 PM, impersonated authorities and broke into house number 140, Lane 1536, Xinzha Road, claiming to search for drugs. In the meantime, they stole seven pounds of coffee essence worth 5,000 yuan in reserve currency and escaped. Also, Chen Yushi and Zhu Guohua, on the morning of May 26th at 9:40 AM, falsely claiming authority, suddenly broke into Changzhou Inn, number 3, Lane 422, North Zhejiang Road, claiming that the innkeeper Wu Azhong had been arrested in connection with a case, intending to extort 20,000 yuan from his wife, Wu Xu. According to Chen Yushi's confession at the police station, he met a friend, Yang Yong, one day who asked him to gather at room 467 of the Jue Lu Hotel on Chuching Road to discuss a matter, saying that there was a lot of heroin somewhere that could be seized. As he spoke, he took out a card with a title, and Chen believed him. He then went to Jue Lu and, along with the others, went to number 140, Lane 1536, Xinzha Road, and seized seven and a half pounds of heroin, which they sold for 6,900 yuan. They were ordered to be detained pending investigation and transfer.</p>
<h3>Defrauding Female Shop Owner, Embezzling Funds, and Fleeing</h3>
<p>Zheng Hongxing, a native of Ningbo (33 years old), had been working as a manager and accountant at the Taixin Rice Wine Shop at number 470, Tokyo Road. The shop owner was a female fellow-townsman named Shen Juying, and Zheng held all the major powers. From May of last year to May of this year, he successively embezzled 10,000 yuan in legal tender from handled goods and bean oil, which he could not make up for. He fled without a trace, disappearing like a yellow crane. Mrs. Shen reported the situation to the Gordon Road Police Station, which dispatched detective Sun Xiaokun, who, based on a confidential tip, found and arrested him around 3:00 PM the other day. He was taken to the police station and prosecuted for embezzlement according to criminal law, with a request for detention. The defendant's confession was evasive, and he requested to go out to find a way to manage. According to Mrs. Shen, she noticed a sudden change in his behavior and asked someone to check the accounts, and he left without saying goodbye and disappeared.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Avenue Dubail</h3>
<p>At 9:30 PM last night, when number 25, Avenue Dubail, in the French Concession, was about to close, bandits suddenly came. One of them pulled out a handgun and threatened the staff, resulting in the robbery of approximately 100 yuan in cash.</p>
<h3>Pawning Fake Bracelets at Zancheng Treasure Shop</h3>
<p>Chen Chunmei, a young woman from Ningbo, 25 years old, residing at number 3, Houjiabang, Nanshi, specializes in using fake gold-inlaid rings to pawn for money at pawnshops. Starting from the 5th of last month, Chen pawned eight of these fake rings at the Chunlai Pawnshop at number 124, Caishi Street, French Concession, for over 200 yuan. Because they were well-made and indistinguishable from real ones, she had never been detected. Yesterday morning, the woman went to pawn again. The pawnshop suspected how she had so many gold rings, which aroused their suspicion. They used test water to check and discovered they were fake. They immediately called the police, who arrived and took the woman into custody, along with the previously pawned fake rings, as evidence. After interrogation at the police station, she was detained for investigation.</p>
<h3>US Marine Corps Detainees to be Evacuated to Africa</h3>
<p>Lieutenant Matsuda, assistant spokesperson for the Japanese Army, stated at a press conference on the 16th that five members of the US Marine Corps attached to the US Consulate General in Shanghai have been released from the Shanghai prisoner-of-war camp and will be evacuated to Lourenço Marques on the Conte Verde with the first batch of repatriated Americans. 2,600 letters issued by Americans in the Shanghai Detention Camp will be carried on the evacuation ship to the United States. In addition, five British wireless operators from the British Embassy in Peiping who were detained at the start of the war have also been released and will leave on the ship carrying repatriated British citizens.</p>
<h3>Jai Alai Court Employees Demand Improved Treatment</h3>
<p>Due to the high cost of living, the salaries earned by the employees of the Jai Alai Court in the French Concession are insufficient to make ends meet. Therefore, they recently sent representatives to demand improved treatment and a 100% increase in salary. It is rumored that the court authorities have agreed to a discretionary increase of 40%, but the labor side still considers it unsatisfactory and continues to demand that their goals be met.</p>
<h3>Xinhua Bank Opens</h3>
<p>Jin Runjie, Wang Yushan, Lian Yi, Zhang Danqiu, Du Ruobo, Dong Lai, Sun, and others organized the Xinhua Bank, which opened yesterday. Chinese and foreign guests from all walks of life attended in succession, making it quite a grand occasion. It is heard that the bank has a capital of one million yuan and specializes in cotton cloth, public bonds. The day of the opening, the business was exceptionally prosperous.</p>
<h3>Dragon Boat Festival History by Liutang</h3>
<p>For a long time, May has been considered a poisonous month, and the fifth day of the fifth month an evil day. The origin of this is ancient, but the explanation is unknown. The Book of the Later Han Dynasty states:</p>
<p>"In the middle of summer, the [fifth] month, all things are flourishing. The day is the summer solstice, and the yin energy begins to sprout, fearing that things will not flourish. The rituals involve using vermilion ropes to connect pungent vegetables, offering them to the god Mimou, beating drums, and using peach seals, six inches long and two inches square, with five-colored written charms according to ritual, to apply to gates and doors. Each dynasty uses what it favors as offerings: The Xiahou clan, associated with metal, made reed caltrops, symbolizing the exchange of qi. The Yin people, associated with water, used snail heads to carefully close off, making them like snails. The Zhou people, associated with wood, used peaches for change, symbolizing the mutual exchange of qi. All [methods] were used together. On the fifth day of the fifth month, vermilion ropes and five-colored seals were used as door decorations to ward off evil qi."</p>
<p>The summer solstice is the mid-month festival in May. In terms of hexagrams, it corresponds to "Encounter" with a strong wind, and one yin begins to be born. The winter solstice corresponds to "Return" with thunder under the earth, and the yang begins to be born. In Jiangnan, the summer solstice falls during the rainy season. Grain in Ear coincides with the "internal mold" rains, just before the summer solstice, and the end of the mold rains is after the summer solstice. After the rainy season comes the summer heat, and all things naturally respond by growing. However, poisonous snakes and insects, as well as epidemics and summer diseases, thrive as a result. This is why the ancients were so apprehensive, fearing that all things would not be able to flourish. Since they had no way to prevent these things, nor the means to drive them away, they could only resort to apotropaic methods. Vermilion ropes, five-colored peach seals used as door decorations to ward off evil qi are the precursors to later shamanic swords and door charms. Therefore, setting May as a poisonous month is not without meaning.</p>
<p>Although the summer solstice is the mid-month festival in May, there is a saying that "Summer Solstice Eve rarely meets the Dragon Boat Festival, and a hundred years rarely meet the Spring Festival at the beginning of the year." Indeed, the Dragon Boat Festival coinciding with the summer solstice is rare. In 18th year of the Republic of China, it was missed by a late day. However, in the first year of the official era, the summer solstice did indeed coincide with the Dragon Boat Festival. The twelfth year of the Republic of China was also the Spring Festival at the beginning of the year. Therefore, those born before the fifth day of the year, at the age of thirty-four, have already experienced what is said to be rare.</p>
<p>The saying that the fifth day of the fifth month is an evil day is seen in the Records of the Grand Historian in the biography of Lord Mengchang:</p>
<p>"Tian Ying had more than ten sons. A concubine had a son named Wen. Wen was born on the fifth day of the fifth month, and Ying told his mother, 'Do not raise him.' But his mother secretly raised him. When he grew up, his mother, through his brothers, had her son Wen meet Tian Ying. Tian Ying was angry at his mother and said, 'If I were to abandon this child, how dare you give birth to him?' Wen bowed his head and asked, 'Why does Your Lordship not raise a child born in the fifth month?' Ying said, 'A child born in the fifth month will grow as tall as the door and will be bad for his parents.' Wen said, 'Does a person's fate come from Heaven or from the door?' Ying was silent. Wen said, 'If his fate comes from Heaven, what does Your Lordship have to worry about? If his fate comes from the door, then he will only be as tall as the middle of the door!' Ying said, 'Stop, my son.'"</p>
<p>And Wen eventually became the heir and was called Lord Mengchang. From then on, all sons born on the fifth day of the fifth month were raised. Wen's rise began here. "Raising" means bathing and nursing a child. "Giving birth" means planning for its growth. According to Popular Customs, it is said that a son born on the fifth day of the fifth month harms his father, and a daughter harms her mother. Although this is superstitious talk, there is still a saying that those born on the fifth day of the fifth month have a "hard fate." A "hard fate" means that they can harm their parents, like Wang Zhen'e, who was born in the evening. The Southern History says:</p>
<p>"Wang Zhen'e: His grandfather, Meng, served Fu Jian and held positions as general and minister. His father, Xiu, was the governor of Hedong. Zhen'e was born in May, and the family wanted to have him adopted into another clan due to the popular taboo. Meng said, 'This is no ordinary child. In the past, Lord Mengchang was born in an evil month and became the Prime Minister of Qi. This child will also bring prosperity to our family.' Therefore, he was named Zhen'e."</p>
<p>Zhen'e later returned to Jin and became a famous general in Song. However, there are also those who consider being born on the Dragon Boat Festival to be auspicious, such as Cui Xinming, the Tang Dynasty poet who is famous for "Maple leaves fall on the Wu River, cold." The New Book of Tang says:</p>
<p>"When Xinming was born, on the fifth day of the fifth month, at midday, strange birds chirped and gathered in the trees of the courtyard. The Grand Astrologer, Shi Liang, divined and said, 'May belongs to fire, and fire represents the trigram of Li, which signifies culture. Midday is the height of culture. The birds are five-colored and chirping; this child will be known for his culture. However, birds are insignificant; his position will probably not be high!'"</p>
<p>Indeed, his words came true. According to the Cold Cottage Miscellany, "Those whose births on the fifth day of the fifth month are recorded in historical books include Lord Mengchang, Hu Guang, Ren Feng, Zhang Huanhou Fei, Wang Zhen'e, Empress Qi, King Qi Nanyang Chuo, Cui Xinming, Emperor Huizong of Song, Weng Yinglong, Ji Mai, Empress Yide of Liao, Zhao Yuan, and others. Their experiences were not the same."</p>
<p>Indeed, historical officials of various dynasties seem to have paid special attention to those born on the Dragon Boat Festival, recording them in great detail. However, as far as we know, Emperor Huizong of Song was born on the tenth day of the tenth month. Among the emperors of the Song Dynasty, only Emperor Gaozong of Song was born on the twenty-first day of the fifth month. None of the others were born in May. Furthermore, there was no Empress Yide in Liao. Only Empress Fu of Emperor Taizong of Song had this posthumous title. These two are likely to be mistakes. Although many of those mentioned were emperors, kings, and nobles, the brothers of the Later Lord of Qi, although from different mothers, were born in the same year, month, and day. Chuo was the eldest son of Emperor Wucheng of Qi, Gao Zhan, and was born at the chen hour (7-9 AM) on the fifth day of the fifth month. At the wu hour (11 AM-1 PM), the Later Lord of Qi, Wei, was born. Chuo's mother, Lady Li, was not the main wife, so he was considered second, while the Later Lord was considered the eldest son. The Later Lord once asked Chuo what was the most enjoyable thing in Zhou (Chuo had once been a governor). Chuo said, "To collect many scorpions, mix them with maggots, and watch, is extremely enjoyable." The Later Lord immediately ordered a peck of scorpions, and by dawn, he had two or three pints. He placed them in a bath, made a person lie naked in the bath, and screamed and writhed. The Emperor and Chuo watched and laughed with delight. The Emperor said to Chuo, "Why didn't you report such an enjoyable thing earlier?" This was cruel, abusive, and inhumane, and considered "such an enjoyable thing." How could he have human feelings? However, the descendants of God of War (Gao Huan) were mostly licentious and fond of killing. Such was the family style; how could it last long? Therefore, Gao Chuo was killed by the Later Lord. The Later Lord himself was captured by Emperor Wu of Zhou (Yuwen Yong), and thirty-three people, including the Prince of Rencheng, were put to death. From then on, only one or two of God of War's descendants survived. Heaven's judgment is not far off; there is indeed retribution. The saying that good and evil will eventually be rewarded is likely the inevitable outcome of the law of karma!</p>
<p>When people talk about Dragon Boat Festival zongzi, five-colored peach ropes, they all say it is made for Qu Yuan. This explanation is based on Record of Harmonizing Anomalies.</p>
<p>"Qu Yuan died by throwing himself into the Miluo River on the fifth day of the fifth month. The people of Chu mourned him, and on this day every year, they stored rice in bamboo tubes and threw them into the water to sacrifice to him. During the Jianwu reign of the Han Dynasty, Qu Hui of Changsha saw a man in broad daylight who claimed to be the Three Grand Counselor. He said to Hui, 'I hear that you often make sacrifices, which is very good. However, all the offerings are stolen by dragons every year. If you are willing to give me something, you can seal them with the leaves of the elm tree and bind them with five-colored silk. The dragons fear these things.' Hui did as he said. On the fifth day of the fifth month, people make zongzi and wear five-colored silk and elm leaves, all remnants of the Miluo tradition."</p>
<p>I say that if this explanation is to be believed, it can only be said to be true for the Wu and Chu regions regarding the Dragon Boat Festival. However, why is it commonly called "Enjoying the Dragon Boat Festival"? "Enjoying" refers to something pleasant and joyful. Some even call it the "Human Festival," from which we know that it is not entirely about commemorating Qu Yuan. Furthermore, in ancient history, grand feasts were often held on the fifth day of the fifth month, not only seen in the Tang Dynasty. For example, during the Kaiyuan period, a banquet was held in the Wucheng Hall on the fifth day of the fifth month, and the officials were granted robes. Li Yuanxian and Xiao Song were given purple robes and gold fish, unmatched by the other officials. It was not only like this in the Tang Dynasty; it was also like this before the Tang Dynasty. The Biography of Cui Chenlun in the History of the North states:</p>
<p>"Julun was detained by Ge Rong, who wanted to make him a yellow gate attendant. Julun hated him. On the fifth day of the fifth month, Rong gathered the officials and ordered Julun to present a poem. Julun then said:</p>
<p>'On the fifth day of the fifth month, the weather is very hot.</p>
<p>Dogs pant and want to die, oxen pant and stick out their tongues.</p>
<p>I use this to hide myself and avoid trouble.'"</p>
<p>Moreover, after the Tang Dynasty, such as during the Liao Dynasty, it was also like this: "On the fifth day of the fifth month, at noon, mugwort leaves and cotton were collected and used to make clothes as offerings to the emperor. The officials, both northern and southern, were each given three items. The ruler and his subjects feasted and made merry. The Bohai chef presented mugwort cakes, and five-colored silk was used as a rope to wrap around the arm, called a 'harmony knot.' Also, a human figure was made from colored silk and worn in the hair, called a 'longevity thread.'"</p>
<p>During the Jin Dynasty, the ritual of worshiping heaven was performed on the fifth day of the fifth month, the middle of the seventh month, and the ninth day of the ninth month. After the ritual, willow shooting and polo playing were performed for entertainment. Polo playing is now popular, so I will describe its playing method.</p>
<p>"For polo, each person rides a horse that they are accustomed to, holding a polo stick, several feet long, with the end shaped like a crescent moon. The crowd is divided into two teams, competing to hit a ball. First, two posts are erected at the south of the polo field, and a board is placed on top, with a hole opened in the bottom as a gate, and a net is added. Whoever wins the ball and hits it into the net bag wins. Or two gates are erected facing each other at both ends, and they push each other, and whoever exits the gate wins. The ball is small, like a fist, hollowed out from light and tough wood and painted red. After the game, a banquet is given, and this is done every year."</p>
<p>These were all land-based feasts during the fifth day of the fifth month. During the Song Dynasty, there were also dragon boat races.</p>
<p>"In the fifth month of the third year of the Xianping reign of Emperor Zhenzong of Song, he visited Jinming Pond to watch water performances. Flags were waved, drums were beaten, and the left and right wings were divided. Trees were planted and tied with colored silk to serve as markers. Square boats advanced quickly, and the first to arrive was rewarded. He moved to Qionglin Garden, ascended the open-air terrace, and played music. Hundreds of performances gathered below the terrace, and all those present were drunk."</p>
<p>During the Shaoxing period of Emperor Gaozong of Song, fans and scarves were always given to officials and Jin envoys during the Dragon Boat Festival. From this, it can be seen that the Dragon Boat Festival was indeed about enjoyment. Saying that it was about mourning Qu Yuan is just one explanation.</p>
<p>"Duan" means beginning. It also means head. May is built on noon, hence it is called Duanwu. In terms of seasons, it is good to take the odd-numbered months and days as seasonal festivals, such as the first day of the first month as New Year's Day, the third day of the third month as Shangsi, the fifth day of the fifth month as Duanwu, also written as Duanwu, the seventh day of the seventh month as Qiqiao, and the ninth day of the ninth month as Chongyang. I was also born on the fifth day of the fifth month, and my nickname is Duansheng. I also sometimes signed myself as "Duan Gong." Later, I learned that it was the title of the Imperial Censor Grandee. Because the Imperial Censor was in the台, he was called御史大夫为台端"Grandee of the Imperial Censor" (now, in letters, commonly written as台端), and he was called "Duan Gong." I knew the reason, so I stopped using the signature.</p>
<h3>Typhus Epidemic</h3>
<p>In the past month, more cases of typhoid fever and typhus have been discovered. Typhus has reached epidemic levels, with the number of cases discovered being about double that of April. A total of 3,124 deaths of Chinese have been recorded, including 1,745 exposed corpses. There were 98 requests to the Hygiene Department for treatment of rabies. The school medical services run by the bureau continue as usual. 263 students suffer from trachoma. Officials were dispatched to investigate 264 privately-run Chinese schools receiving subsidies. It was found that 30 of them were fully compliant with the requirements of the Department of Medical Health, and 6 schools are able to find ways to improve facilities. All vegetable markets operate as usual. 467,116 citizens received free vaccinations last month, compared to 105,879 in April. The reason for the sudden increase is that proof of vaccination is required to purchase rice. Work to eradicate mosquitoes and flies is being intensified. In view of the approaching summer, the Hygiene Department has paid close attention to factories producing beverages to stress sanitation. British domestic servant</p>
<h3>Stealing a Huge Sum from the Master</h3>
<p>Liu Zhilin, 28 years old, from Fengtian, a domestic servant of British man Bolunte, an employee of the HSBC Bank residing at 1175 Avenue Foch, took advantage of his master's absence between the 26th and 28th of last month, sneaking into the room and stealing US$320 in bills, $100 in savings certificates, and several thousand old French francs, totaling 14,749 yuan, before fleeing. When the master returned home and discovered the theft, he reported it to the police, who arrested Liu and recovered the original stolen US$10 in bills and the $100 in savings certificates. The rest of the money could not be recovered. Taken to the police station, Liu confessed that the missing money had been lost in gambling dens in Nanshi and he had no ability to return it. The police chief ordered him to be detained pending investigation and verification.</p>

<h3>Public Works Department Fire Report</h3>

<h3>"Dragon vs. Tiger" Premieres Today</h3>
<p>"Dragon vs. Tiger," a martial arts romance film, premieres tonight at the Huguang Grand Theatre. The female lead is Ms. Bai Mei, whose beauty and artistic talent are exceptional. The male lead, Xu Cong, has a long history in the film industry and has acted in many films. The plot of "Dragon vs. Tiger" is also well-suited to the tastes of the Chinese people. It tells the story of a young man who strives for progress but, due to the decline of his family, seeks help from his fiancee's father. This old man, a staunch believer in power and money, despises the young man for his poverty and secretly orders his servant to murder him in the middle of the night, hoping to renege on the marriage. The daughter learns of the matter and is greatly displeased, so she helps the young man escape to the capital to take the imperial examination and kills the servant. Fearing punishment, the daughter also disguises herself as a man and flees to the capital. At the martial arts arena, she meets the young man again. The young man, with his high martial arts skills, passes the exam and becomes the martial arts champion. He returns home in glory, and the old man is awestruck. He sets up a banquet and completes the marriage. Lovers finally become husband and wife. The plot is twisted and bizarre, depicting the superficiality of human relationships and the fickleness of the world, which is infuriating.</p>

Afterwards, he was sent to Tongren Second Hospital for treatment. Miraculous Success in Treating Madness and Insanity</p>
<h3>More than Ten People Cured</h3>
<p>Madness and insanity have always been regarded as incurable diseases.

Those who wish to obtain the calligraphy of Mr. Yuan or the paintings of Mr. Chen can immediately go to order them.</p>

<h3>Public Debt Ding Category Rebounds Vigorously</h3>
<p>The unofficial market for public debt continued to trend upward yesterday. Category Ding rebounded particularly strongly. People were still solely focused on buying, and the bullish side pushed prices up even more. Categories Yi and Bing briefly exceeded the 40-yuan mark. However, forward selling gradually revived. Once the remaining stock is sold out, it is expected that there will be a new initiative. Currently, the public debt market is fortunate to still be a free market. Yesterday, the selling side was mostly Tongli, while Hongxing, Lianyi, Xinji, Hongda, Wuhuo, and Runde also liquidated quite a bit. However, the buying side did not mind, and companies like Jiufeng Changji bought enthusiastically. Tongsheng, Chengkang, Shuntai, Qianyi, Shilong, and Tongkang all bought in, holding onto their old ideas and solely focusing on buying. This may not be a well-rounded plan. As a result, market prices uniformly increased by one to three yuan and six jiao. Approximately 2.7 to 2.8 million yuan worth of transactions took place. A simplified table is listed below (today is the Dragon Boat Festival holiday).</p>
<p>Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>Unified A | 43.0 | 42.1 | 43.00 | Up 1.00</p>
<p>Unified B | 0.50 | 18.4 | 40.40 | Up 1.90</p>
<p>Unified C | 41.00 | 38.50 | 40.60 | Up 2.10</p>
<p>Unified Ding | 37.70 | 35.50 | 37.60 | Up 3.60</p>
<p>Unified E | 3.0 | 28.90 | Up 1.90</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Fluctuate, Foreign Stocks Generate an Unofficial Market</h3>
<p>The trend of Chinese stocks remained flat, fluctuating within a narrow range. Transactions in the financial sector were limited, with Jiaotong Bank shares trading around 145 yuan. Textile stocks were quiet. The prices for each category are listed below:</p>
<p>Category | Highest | Lowest | Final</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>New Asia | 51.00 | 48.00 | 49.50</p>

<h3>Cotton Cloth Market Firm and High</h3>
<p>The market for factory-produced cloth was firm and high yesterday. All types of cloth continued to rise in price. 16-pound Globe coarse cloth was 205 yuan, Flying Swan 202 yuan, 9-pound New Character 124 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong 123 yuan, 12-pound Globe fine cloth 184 yuan, Dapeng New Single 175 yuan, Fugui 180 yuan, Fugui fine twill 162 yuan, Peach Blossom Lady Lin Chen opened at 302 yuan, midday closed at 304 yuan, and the evening closed rose to 305 yuan, an increase of 4 yuan per bolt compared to the previous day. Magnolia bleached cloth was 182 yuan, Qin Liangyu 175 yuan, Longevity Prefecture Silk 6.5 yuan, and Volleyball 4.4 yuan, all showing remarkable strength.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth also remained firm, showing a tendency to rise despite expectations of a fall. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth New Single opened at 222 yuan, fluctuating for a long time. Ultimately, due to a lack of sellers, it strengthened further at the close. The midday closing price was 225 yuan, and the opening price was 226 yuan, an increase of approximately 3 yuan. Bank order 86 yuan, and Colored Ball fine cloth 195 yuan, were both extremely scarce. Four Gentlemen Serge opened at 8.29 yuan, the midday closing was 8.37 yuan, also up 9 fen.</p>
<h3>Rainproof Cloth Sells Well Timely</h3>
<p>Due to the exhaustion of imported raincoat materials from the East and West, the sales of locally produced rainproof cloth have long been boosted. For the selection of Chinese and Western raincoats, nineteen out of twenty invariably choose this material. All tailors shops in Shanghai, big and small, equip themselves with it, which also shows its popularity and strong sales. Recently, the market is very short of goods, and prices are rising. The active sales have led to demand exceeding supply. Upon investigation, there are only two formal manufacturers of rainproof cloth: Yousheng and Rentai. Most of their products are busy delivering orders, so those who want goods mostly go to Xiang Sheng, Rongchangde, Dachangxing and other established stores to redeem orders. Yesterday, Yousheng Yu Xiong old brand sold for 27 yuan per yard, Fu Chou Pao Po Lin 33 yuan, Rentai Orangutan Tarzan rainproof cloth number one 18 yuan, number two 25 yuan, Baobielin 35 yuan.</p>
<h3>New Broad Beans Arrive Sparsely, Sales Prices Soar by More Than Ten Yuan</h3>
<p>Bean transactions were reduced yesterday due to the proximity of the holiday. Only a few retail sales were made. However, sellers remained eager to sell, and the market continued to show a firm rise. New broad beans, arriving sparsely and selling actively, soared by more than ten yuan. Red beans also rose by one or two yuan. For example, 30 packages of Hongqiao new green broad beans were priced at 170 yuan to 171.5 yuan. More than 100 packages of Tianjin red beans were priced at 185 yuan to 180 yuan. 20 packages of Chongming sand red beans were priced at 191 yuan.</p>
<p>Due to the gradual arrival of corn from various roads, people suddenly became pessimistic, and prices fell back by more than ten yuan. For example, two carts of Chuzhou corn were priced at 123 yuan to 120 yuan. Two carts of Wuhu corn were priced at 118 yuan to 119 yuan.</p>
<p>Soybean cake transactions were lackluster yesterday. Stockpiling sales were flat and weak. The market was mixed, and prices fluctuated slightly by one or two yuan. For example, 500 pieces of Li Zi brand April new warehouse order were priced at 57.5 yuan. 500 pieces of Feng Ji brand May new warehouse order were priced at 59 yuan. 1,000 pieces of Sheng Ji brand June old warehouse order were priced at 52 yuan to 51.5 yuan, and 500 pieces of February warehouse order were priced at 53 yuan, and 500 pieces of April new warehouse order were priced at 58 yuan. The exchange rate for silver remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>The Exchange Rate for Silver Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Daxin, a major silver firm, quoted the exchange rate for standard silver at 18 yuan per tael, unchanged. The black market price for operators to buy and sell was 16 yuan and 15 yuan. Silver coins slightly rose by five jiao to nine yuan per coin. The exchange rate for gold jewelry also remained at 2,700 yuan per tael, unchanged (purchase price reduced by 300 yuan). The black market price rose from 2,456 yuan to around 2,490 yuan per tael, also showing a slight increase. It was said to be 2,500 yuan in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Show No Significant Fluctuations</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign currency market saw the British and American gold pounds rise to 5,790 yuan. US dollar notes remained around 38 yuan. Hong Kong notes rose to 4.45 yuan. Military notes were around 5.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association remained at 1 jiao and 8 fen. The new exchange rate was flat, with a hidden premium of about 10 yuan per 1,000 yuan still required. The buying and selling price of Central Reserve Bank notes and old currency was said to be 1.58 yuan and 1.02 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Recently, as military notes have not fluctuated much, sugar prices have stabilized accordingly. However, sugar stocks have fluctuated. Yesterday, the market price of coarse granulated sugar was 305 yuan, slightly lower than the previous day, while the price of red granulated sugar was tighter at 295 yuan. Because the cooperation office has not yet completed the adjustment and management procedures for the sugar distributed to other merchants this month, it is feared that it will not be possible to distribute it within the month. As for the price, they are currently consulting with the authorities, and it will probably increase somewhat, because other commodities have already risen sharply, and expenses have also increased.</p>
<h3>Green Bamboo Shoots Arrive on the Market</h3>
<p>The first batch of green bamboo shoots and bamboo shoot skins have arrived, with more than 80 pieces of dried bamboo shoots and only a few pieces of bamboo shoot skins. Yesterday, the opening price was: raw bamboo shoot skins were priced at 900 yuan per dan (a unit of weight), cooked bamboo shoot skins at 1,400 yuan, bald shoots at 18 yuan per basket, and fat shoots at 21 yuan per basket. Early yuan bamboo shoots were not yet available. Upon investigation, last year's price for bamboo shoot skins was 370 yuan, and the price for dried bamboo shoots was 6.3 yuan to 6.5 yuan, which is incomparable.</p>
<h3>Tangerine Peel Stores Raise Prices Across the Board</h3>
<p>Recently, there has been a lack of continued arrivals of tangerine peel. Only a dozen or so pieces are in stock. Store prices have risen by about 100 yuan compared to the old prices. Due to the scarcity of arrivals and inventory, the store prices are inevitably tighter. Yesterday, the market price rose by 50 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes and Soap Candles: Market Remains Calm</h3>
<p>Regarding the market conditions for cigarettes and daily necessities, yesterday, the market resumed normal business after the previous day's trading prices came to a halt. The market conditions for foreign factory goods were slightly more active, while Japanese cigarettes remained stable as usual. Because it was the Dragon Boat Festival holiday and the half-year closing period for the banking industry, transactions were quite slow. The prices quoted were: British brand 18,300 yuan, Old Knife brand 12,000 yuan, Pin brand 9,500 yuan, Fairy brand 8,500 bolts, Five Flowers brand 8,100 yuan, Japanese cigarette Golden Gun brand 3,320 yuan, Golden Mansion brand 4,800 yuan, Red Rose brand 1,900 yuan, Quanlu brand 4,350 yuan, Compass brand 3,200 yuan, National cigarette Golden Mouse brand 4,500 yuan, and Beauty brand 7,300 yuan. There were no dramatic increases or decreases. The market prices for matches, candles, and soaps were similar to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Closing Accounts for the Dragon Boat Festival, Cement and Steel Bars Have Even Fewer Transactions</h3>
<p>Sales of 40-foot steel bars have been sluggish recently. The construction industry in Shanghai has plummeted, and the livelihood of foreign customers is also poor. In addition, due to the Dragon Boat Festival, buyers have temporarily suspended the purchase of hardware, so transactions have been even scarcer. However, the industry remains unwilling to soften its stance, and the standard prices for all goods remain at their original levels. Yesterday, 3/4-inch colored cement steel bars sold for 8,200 yuan per ton, while 5/8-inch to 1-inch goods sold for around 8,000 yuan. Galvanized iron wire sold for 550 yuan per dan, and the new price also opened at 550 yuan. Old Bear Steel and Double Horse Steel were 700 yuan per box. Various soft and hard round, square, and flat wires were sold for 8,000 yuan per ton. Various thicknesses and sizes of shear iron were also sold for 8,000 yuan. Black iron sheets, numbers 12 to 14, were priced at 10,000 yuan per ton, number 20 at 11,000 yuan per ton, and Daguan skin at 14,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Money Trade Reserve Bank Allows All Banks to Transfer Float into Cash Account via Transfer, Unable to Transfer Back to Cash Float Deposit Account, Interest Accrual Temporarily Postponed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Money Trade United Reserve Bank announced to member banks: According to the decision of the bank's executive committee, if banks need to transfer floats, they can transfer them to cash accounts. However, once transferred, they cannot be transferred back to the cash account from the float account. Records will be kept. If banks need to transfer from cash accounts to float accounts, please come and contact us. A portion of the float deposits received by the bank were originally transferred from the Central, China and Jiaotong Banks. Since these three banks suspended operations after December 8th of last year, the interest on the deposits has not yet been settled. The interest on all banks' float current accounts deposited with the bank, from January 1942 to the end of June, should also be temporarily postponed.</p>

<h3>Inside the Laboratory</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>These past few days, the work in the laboratory has been quite busy, with a lot of testing to do: urine, stool, sputum, blood, pus, and other bodily fluids. These many colorful and beautiful treasures are indeed our important materials.</p>
<p>The director hasn't arrived yet, so I'll start by testing the urine, which is a common and relatively easy task.</p>
<p>Don't underestimate these things. If you spill them, it's truly worse than death. Would you be embarrassed to ask the patient for another sample? The responsibility of [careful work] must be absolutely followed. Wearing a white lab coat, this place is a small battlefield for spreading various germs. We should rather believe that the enemy is cruel and ruthless, and not think that we are omnipotent. If we are careless, then we are in trouble.</p>
<p>Do you think that urine is all yellow? If you put more than a dozen bottles in a row, wouldn't they look just like the colorful ice soda sold by vendors on the street? Light yellow, orange-yellow, slightly red, brown, grass-green, red, black, milky white, white. But you must not despise its smell. You must wave your hand and smell it, then pour it into a measuring cup to measure the specific gravity. The heavier it is, the worse it is. There are really many variations in urine. Drop the last drop of sedimented urine onto a glass slide and look under a microscope. How many white blood cells, red blood cells, kidney tubules, cylindrical bodies, mucus threads, and epithelial cells are there? Are there any parasites? The crystals are the most interesting. Some look like the pyramids of Egypt, and some look like the exquisite rhinestones that women love. But in reality, they are nothing more than uric acid, oxalic acid, phosphate, calcium carbonate, and so on.</p>
<p>Next, a qualitative test is performed. Add some chemical reagents to test for the presence of acetic acid, diacetic acid, urobilinogen, bile pigment, and even lead, mercury, and arsenic.</p>
<p>If everyone's urine could be tested for sugar, we could set up a sugar shop and sell sweet sugar. This is, of course, a joke. Diabetes is so painful! Sometimes, patients specifically request to test for protein, which is sad for their kidneys. If there is protein, they must be treated properly.</p>
<p>After the director comes to work, the work inevitably becomes more tense.</p>
<p>Testing the blood now. First, determine the percentage of hemoglobin, then count the total number of red blood cells and the total number of white blood cells under a microscope. Then, perform a differential count on a glass slide: total number of neutrophils, total number of lymphocytes, total number of monocytes, and number of platelets. Abnormal pathological red blood cells and white blood cells, too little pigment, malaria protozoa, or relapsing fever spirochetes may be found. We can imagine that the patient is having a high fever, or yellow skin, shivering with cold.</p>
<p>In addition, blood type tests are performed. Use a weak magnification objective lens to examine the agglutination phenomenon of blood cells mixed with known blood sera, and record the results. Thus, there are types O, A, B, and AB. People of type A can receive blood. Among them, only type O is fortunate. He (or she) can donate blood to people of any blood type and can also receive blood of any blood type without restriction. If other different blood types receive incompatible blood, then it is like a bomb meeting fire, and everyone will perish in an instant, and there will be a danger to life. In Europe and the United States, almost everyone has had their blood type tested, which is much more convenient.</p>
<p>Blood can also be tested for the Kahn test or the Wassermann test, which is very useful in cities. It is specifically designed to test people with syphilis. Some couples want to get divorced and often accuse each other of having this disease. Some also hire wet nurses and are not comfortable with her health. Some do it for the convenience of diagnosis, so we have to check. The 100,000 blood drawn from the vein, if there is not enough time to do it that day, must be frozen in an electric refrigerator. Because this procedure is quite cumbersome, in addition to taking out the clotted blood, it must also be shaken in a centrifuge for ten minutes, only to get the serum. Thus, the glass tubes on the copper frame come out from one row to another, and are mixed, sucked, shaken, and incubated many times. Finally, when it is done, we shout out a positive reaction! Or a negative reaction!</p>
<p>The business of stool is mostly taken care of by children, probably because they like to eat snacks. But we also eagerly search for a few tapeworm eggs or roundworm eggs, etc., as if it is very interesting.</p>
<p>Sputum is a mess. To the naked eye, it is nothing more than a thick yellow sputum or a clear, watery white foam. But when you put it on a slide and look under a microscope, you will be really scared. Some dust in the air forms a few handfuls of messy straw placed in a pile of mud. Moving the glass slide and looking again, there are influenza bacilli, which is not so important. Unfortunately, many TB (tuberculosis bacilli) small rods are found, lying horizontally and vertically in the pile of grass, mixed with a few blood cells. This ghost thing is taking away so many [achievements] of the world!</p>
<p>Culturing bacteria should be the most sacred work. We don't care about the sweating. The windows and doors are tightly closed, and no flying insects are allowed inside. Everyone should sit or stand as they please. The air must be absolutely still. Gently apply the bacteria to be cultured (from pus or other bodily fluids) to the culture medium. After 24 hours, take it out of the incubator. The air must also be kept still. The culture medium in the glass container is already full of extremely evil bacteria that devour human life. Sometimes we are culturing typhoid bacteria, or diphtheria bacteria, pyogenic streptococci of septicemia, gonococci, and other bacteria. When we discard them, we immediately implement strict disinfection methods to destroy them.</p>
<p>The easy part is drawing blood from goats and Dutch piglets (for antitoxin purposes). Goats are the most obedient. With a few kind words, they lie down gently and let us do whatever we want. Piglets are always uncooperative, humming and screaming. We have to get them drunk with alcohol, but in reality, it doesn't take much, just a few dozen drops.</p>
<p>Sometimes we are like the chief cooks, arbitrarily cutting fresh beef, blood-red pig lungs, and large pieces of pig liver. After weighing, we put them on agar, cook them and steam them, disinfect them, and put them in bottles. It turns out that this is to make a large amount of culture medium for use at any time.</p>
<p>After the reports of each test are issued, the day is over. Dragging our tired bodies, we leave the laboratory.</p>

<h3>I Have Lung Disease – Another Side of Life –</h3>
<p>— Luo Chen</p>
<p>The doctor said that my lung disease is already in the second stage.</p>
<p>The other day, a friend in Free Talk said: If you have lung disease, don't worry! But how can this keep me from worrying?</p>
<p>Don't worry? – Yes, I know that although the medical community has not yet invented a completely specific medicine for lung disease today, people are not completely helpless against lung disease. I know I have to take cod liver oil, I know I have to inject calcium, I know I have to drink milk, eggs, and beef broth, I know I have to get plenty of rest... but how can I do all of this?</p>
<p>Every day, I have to get up early and walk half an hour to school. You say, "Why not take the bus? Walking will make your illness worse." But do you know that the tram has increased its price again? I can't afford to take the bus. Once at school, I have to strain my throat from morning to night, spending a full eight hours hoarsely screaming. The elementary school students are shouting and making noise, preventing you from having a moment of peace. On the one hand, I also have to watch the headmaster's face. Every time I see the students being active, I feel sad – how wonderful it would be if I could go back to that carefree and innocent childhood!</p>
<p>Coming home, I am completely exhausted. I cough. I feel a dull pain in my chest. Looking in the mirror, I find myself getting thinner day by day. On my prominent cheekbones, two red patches of lung disease appear. I'm afraid! I threw down the mirror and buried my head in my palms – Ah! I have lung disease! A consumptive ghost!</p>
<p>Take a break! I told myself that I can't go on like this. I went to see the doctor. The doctor complained: Why didn't you come earlier? If you had come two months earlier, things would have been much easier! Yes, why didn't I come earlier? Oh no, why did I come at all? I knew I had lung disease, two months ago – three months ago I also knew that I must have lung disease, why did I go to see a doctor? The doctor, of course, said, "Don't worry, rest well!" That's right, rest! But as soon as I get home, I see my wife's bitter face, and the children are opening their mouths and shouting, "We're hungry!"</p>
<p>Don't worry? How can I not worry? I have to take cod liver oil, but the children need to eat!</p>

<h3>Ten Thousand People's Slave</h3>
<p>— Lü Shuhui</p>
<p>(1) I am a waiter in a restaurant</p>
<p>Humans, individuals, exist in the world, perhaps as the ancients said: "A leaf on a big tree, a grain in a granary"? However, viewed in this way, humans are quite insignificant. Maybe people will never know that such a grain or a leaf exists – unless that person can be recognized by the world and appears in historical records; then, he can be considered an extraordinary person – an extraordinary grain, a leaf. But how can you be discovered by the people of the world and leave a name for eternity? I don't know these "ways to rise in society," but if you want to wash away your shadow from the minds of the people in society, or become an ordinary and mediocre person, so that they simply don't know you exist, then I can dutifully reply to you: "Please go and be a waiter in a restaurant!"</p>
<p>"What, isn't being a waiter a decent profession? Are they really never recognized or discovered by the people of society? You're being too dismissive of them!" Perhaps someone might ask me in surprise like this. But, alas! I am not being dismissive of them, just as I am not being dismissive of myself. Perhaps this is because onlookers see more clearly, but our lives, environment, and difficulties cannot be understood by those "not in the situation!"</p>
<p>In a restaurant, if you want to become someone who "eats well, knows food, is clever (falsely intelligent), and learns to be lazy" (these are the buzzwords in the restaurant industry), then that's very easy. It's exactly "If you want to learn the language of Chu, you must go to Chu!" But if you want to learn to be a "top scholar" in a restaurant, perhaps there are one or two who will become world-famous, but in the past, I dare say it has never been heard of.</p>
<p>If you want to find a way out, then you must "start your own business!" Why? I cannot list them one by one. In short, restaurants only "bury talent" and do not "cultivate talent." This is the source of its illness in a nutshell.</p>
<p>Working in a restaurant, to put it nicely, is "serving the public." To put it bluntly, it is being a "slave to ten thousand people." But this is not enough to be its illness.</p>
<p>I am "in the situation," of course, I know more details. Although I don't have much "experience," three years is enough! In that long – or short, in the eyes of others – process, I have gained many lessons. I have uncovered the secrets of the inner layers of society, and I recognize this difficult life where one cannot survive without striving and struggling! (End of first part)</p>

<h3>Five-Person Bicycle</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiao</p>
<p>The bicycles in Shanghai are truly diverse and strange. However, a five-person bicycle seems to be unheard of. This can truly be said to be one strong hand among many strong hands; the world is so big, and there are many strange and bizarre things. This five-person bicycle is actually made up of three bicycles. It is simply impossible for five people to ride one bicycle. Among these three bicycles, one has front and rear seats. This creates four seats, and the other person sits in the front row in the helmsman's seat. Four people drive the bicycle, and one person controls the direction. But I don't know if this novel vehicle will appear on the Shanghai Bund.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Words</h3>
<p>— Jimi</p>
<p>Nearsighted people need a pair of glasses to correct their shortsightedness. However, there are even more invisible nearsighted people in the world! They all lack the vision of farsighted people.</p>
<p>The wind is too flying, and the mountain is too still, but they are both stronger than the floating clouds.</p>
<p>Do you prefer a fresh flower blooming in a beautiful garden for people to admire, or blooming in a desolate desert to comfort the lonely released prisoner?</p>
<h3>Errors</h3>
<p>— Zheng Zheng</p>
<p>In all sciences, error precedes truth.</p>
<p>Sometimes we learn more from a person's mistakes than from their virtues.</p>
<p>To not make mistakes is beyond human ability, but the wise often learn from their errors and use them for future wisdom.</p>
<p>Honest errors should be pitied, not ridiculed.</p>
<p>Animals</p>
<h3>Dancing Mice</h3>
<p>— Dong Kang</p>
<p>Dancing mice are a strange kind of animal. Their physiology is the same as ordinary mice. When they dance, they circle around and around very quickly, for a long time, perhaps a few minutes. Sometimes they stand on their hind legs and jump a few times, or circle in a large circle. If there is an obstacle in their way as they circle, it will not stop them from dancing. They will find another place and continue to dance. Dancing mice have great perseverance. Even if they jump out of the cage, they will dance again after a short rest, so people can catch them again.</p>
<p>American biologist Helen Dicken conducted an experiment in which she crossed several generations of wild mice and bred several dancing mice. Before this, the biologist had bred several generations of white mice, a total of five thousand, but none of them could dance. Now, in their same generation, there are a total of seventy-four siblings, two males, and one female who can waltz.</p>
<p>Male dancing mice are very irritable and prone to fighting with their own kind. The females are more gentle and can live peacefully with other female mice, but if a strange dancing mouse mixes in, they will kill the newcomer together. Their reproductive capacity is weak, and their breeding period is short.</p>
<p>Dancing mice eat a lot, and even their offspring who do not dance eat more than ordinary mice. There is a type of dancing mouse with neurosis that eats even more and drinks a lot of water. Their front paws often make the same movements repeatedly, and their character is very similar to that of dancing mice.</p>
<p>Nature</p>
<h3>Mysterious Ozone</h3>
<p>— Shi Dong</p>
<p>Ozone, oxygen, and water vapor coexist in the atmosphere that covers the Earth's surface to a height of one hundred and forty miles. If we did not have these three gases, the Earth's temperature would tend to extremes, so that summer would make us die of heat, and winter would make us freeze to death.</p>
<p>Ozone is most effective at a distance of seventy to one hundred miles from the Earth's surface. Here it forms a layer that absorbs the ultraviolet rays emitted by the sun, preventing them from shining on us with full force. If ultraviolet rays did not pass through this layer and shone on us with full force, then I would not be here writing this article, and you would not be here reading it!</p>
<p>But our friend ozone is doing double duty. On the one hand, it prevents heat from shining directly on the Earth, and on the other hand, it prevents too much heat from escaping from the Earth. If heat could escape freely from the Earth, then after the sun sets, the temperature would suddenly drop to hundreds of degrees below zero.</p>
<p>In carrying out this important work, ozone has a good helper, which is dust. Any ultraviolet rays that the ozone layer cannot absorb are filtered down by dust, so that we can obtain a moderate temperature. It also regulates the movement of clouds and the evaporation of water.</p>
<p>If there were no dust to hinder it, large amounts of water vapor would be absorbed into the air, causing rivers, lakes, and oceans to dry up. Then this large amount of water would fall violently on the earth, causing huge floods, and we would all drown.</p>
<h3>Thornless Rose</h3>
<p>— Bi Geng</p>
<p>The color of the rose is the most beautiful and the most sweet, but it has sharp thorns, making it loved but not easy to get. Poets say: The rose is a symbol of love, which is indeed accurate. Thornless roses have been dreamed of by gardeners for hundreds of years but have not yet been achieved. Recently, it has been successfully cultivated by a gardener named Ge Li in Connecticut, USA. He has therefore won the honor of being a rose planting expert. This peculiar rose was accidentally discovered a year ago. Now, its young buds are grafted onto the roots of other roses. Then it is placed in a warm and airtight incubator for six weeks, and then transplanted into a pot of soil in a flower room to grow.</p>
<p>A thornless rose has been discovered, but who has discovered a thornless love?</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat Through Wind and Rain</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(6) In the Blink of an Eye</p>
<p>Wei Cheng's biological mother was gone, and his aunt was his mother. His mother did not want him to do this, but he insisted on doing it, which was really too much. He looked at his aunt's face and then at his mother's portrait, and could not bear to mention going to Shanghai again. From that day on, he set a daily schedule, writing in a diary, reading, writing, and inspecting the acres of land, these essential courses, noted on it. Inspecting the acres of land meant checking the crops in the fields. During his inspection time, he would either look east or look west. Westward, was where the person he cared about was, looking at the clouds in the sky, perhaps that cloud was above Guo Fang and Sister Cui Zhen. Eastward, was where Cui Zhen would return from, that must be from the east.</p>
<p>Two days later, Cui Zhen returned. Wei Cheng was writing in his diary when he heard the sound. He quickly put down his pen and went out to greet her, then walked ahead to lead her in. Madam Ye the Second, Magpie, and He Ma all surrounded her and asked questions. Wei Cheng saw that Cui Zhen's face was whiter than when she had left, and even her standing and sitting postures had changed. On the table were the canned foods and five-pound boxes of biscuits she had brought back. He thought that these things were undoubtedly sent by Guo Fang. Guo Fang herself liked to eat biscuits and sweets, and she thought of sending people these things by judging others by herself. He suddenly heard his aunt saying, "If you didn't come back, Brother Cheng was going to come to Shanghai to find you. He thinks about you every day." Her words seemed to remind Wei Cheng and also gave him a chance to talk to Cui Zhen, so he quickly asked, "Sister Cui Zhen, did you come back on Zhang Shu Rong's boat?" Cui Zhen said, "Yes. Miss Chen personally sent me to the pier and also sent many things. This time, she spent a lot of money. The ship arrived late today. When it arrived at Hua Gang, Zhang Shu Rong wanted to send the boat back to get me, but I said that I had only been to Shanghai once, so how could I be so delicate? He also wanted to help me carry things, but I didn't want him to, so I walked back. Miss Chen didn't want me to leave yet and wanted to wait for Brother Cheng to come and pick me up, but I said that if Brother Cheng came out, Second Aunt would be even more lonely, so I didn't want him to come out." Wei Cheng said, "How many days did Sister Cui Zhen stay in Shanghai?" Cui Zhen said, "About seven or eight days. I wanted to come back every day." Madam Ye the Second urged Qin Zhen to go eat, interrupting the siblings' conversation. (105)</p>
