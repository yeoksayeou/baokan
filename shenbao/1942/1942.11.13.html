<p>事有凑巧，一九〇八年間，摩洛哥內亂，土著排外情緒如火如荼。薩威耶族土著，曾在加薩勃朗加港，殺死法人五名，歐洲人三名。事態如此嚴重，法國就派砲艦轟擊該港，並派兵三千佔據該港及其北面的拉巴特。稍後，新蘇丹即位，統馭無方，不到三年，弄得全國皆叛，被叛軍所圍。蘇丹只得要求法國救駕，法國唯恐不盡命，派兵一萬人，打敗叛軍，乘勢佔據斐茲城，重要城鎭，至是盡入法人之手。</p>
<p>一九一二年十一月間，法國和西班牙簽訂最後一次協定。摩洛哥北部長的二百英里深的六十英里之區，劃歸西國。丹吉爾港及其附近四十英里地方劃爲國際中立地帶，其餘，屬於法國，天下三分，暫安一時。法國對於摩洛哥，採取和都尼西亞同樣的懷柔政策，以免壓力過重，引起土著的反抗，而無謂地流血。換言之，蘇丹接受法國保護，法國總監爲太上政府，法國文武官員助理當地行政。</p>
<p>可是即使這樣的懷柔政策，也未見收效於一時，不久摩洛哥土著叛變，殺死斐茲城法人八十名，一時全境騷然。西班牙轄境情形更糟，西國軍隊且被土著軍擊敗。土著領袖有名克里姆的，智勇雙全，號召山嶺地帶的土著，攻擊外國人，實行其摩洛哥人的摩洛哥主義。一九二五年，聲勢極盛，企圖進攻法國佔領區域，法國談虎色變，不得不和西班牙聯合對付，法國並派現任元首的貝當上將督戰。戰爭的壯烈，空前絕後，可惜法國沒有像吉百齡一般的大文豪，把殖民地戰爭寫得可歌可哭。是年終法國殖民地軍隊已陣亡一萬一千餘名。至一九二六年，克里姆始就擒，解往雷羽尼翁島。國境差吿敉平。</p>
<p>摩洛哥是一個摩登的古典的同時又是一個野蠻的國家。境內飛機和駱駝隊同時存在，而且存在的年代也是一般。他們已經浴了一千年的東方文化，他們又容納了西方各色人種和文化。全境面積四十三萬一千方公里，人口的六百萬左右。其重要城市和港口有首府拉巴特，斐茲，馬拉喀斯，加薩勃朗加，摩洛哥城，摩加杜爾，阿加的爾等。全境富於森林橡樹和牲畜。高原上有原始的柏樹，幹高矗天，有的幾和十四層大厦相等。樹的年齡有的達四百年。法國當局努力保護森林，但土著却隨便把它斫伐。斫伐的方法非常奇特，不用斧頭，不用鋸子，只在樹幹上放一把野火，把樹身燒斷，讓大樹自己躺下來。</p>
<p>摩洛哥的政治中心雖在法國總監駐節所在的拉巴特，但回敎土著酋長歡迎住在馬拉喀斯城，該城房屋都是染紅色的，號稱「赤城」，城內有棕櫚樹九百株，紅綠掩映，極盡美觀。各城市中，回教寺院林立，土著信奉回敎誠篤「上帝只有一個，穆罕默德是上帝的先知，」人人這樣禱吿着。拉巴特的蘇丹，每逢星期五拜神的時候，有偉大的行列，民衆夾道歡呼，懿歟盛哉。</p>
<p>摩洛哥內地有許多大大小小的酋長，他們各住着堡壘或營帳，自成一個小小天下，較大的酋長往往妻妾成羣，僕從如雲，擁有數萬匹的馬牛和羊。土著分居各有領域，山地以擺擺人居多，平原以阿刺伯人及摩爾人居多。摩洛哥民性强悍，好爭鬥，不怕死。他們對於自己的酋長和蘇丹，往往也崛强不服從，何况對於外國人。所以雖至今日之下，單身的外國人仍不敢深入腹地。不過編人法國殖民地軍隊的糜洛哥人，却是以勇敢善戰聞名。</p>
<p>擺擺族男子，個個瘦骨嶙峋，但動作異常敏捷，婦女們露着美麗的黑瞳子，充滿熱情的風韻。他們比較別處的回敎姊妹們來得開通，她們不帶面幕，操作家務，是道地的賢妻良母，並且還有相當的財產權。要不是非洲的太陽，晒得利害，她們的皮膚還白嫩的很，因爲他們是半白種人呀。</p>
<p>國際商港的摩洛哥，與位列世界大都會的上海自有其相同之處。摩洛哥城市裏的力塲中，可以發現上海城隍廟或大世界十裏的風光。那裏白天有種種熱鬧的娛樂塲子。弄蛇的，跳舞的，變戲法的，唱戲的，說書的，應有盡有。他們不賣門票，一律隨絲樂助。看客不分男女貴賤巷少，大家一列平等享受，眞是一個典型的犬衆娛樂塲。可是，這一種坐井觀天的荀安局面，現在已無法維持了，英美聯軍已在摩洛哥海岸登陸了，如果摩洛哥有失，則不但法屬北非靠不住，連西非達加爾恐怕也岌岌可危了。</p>

<p>— 周</p>
<p>趁總理誕辰紀念，偷得半日閒，赴黃園賞菊，難免有俗人充雅士之感。</p>
<p>行盡曲徑，居然通幽，到得黃園，萬斛俗塵，自然一洗，主人黃岳淍先生親理花事，豪興猶昔，曠觀石山，俯品秋菊，猛然想起貫休詩「荷深似入苕溪路，石怪疑行雁蕩間，只恐中原方鼎沸，天心未遣主人閒」。也好像很足以移贈主人。我是僅僅抱着同情菊傲嚴霜，勁節可風的心情去看菊的，當然不懂得品種，鳳爪滿天星，都無從知其名貴，只見黃華飄逸，不同凡俗，算是我曾讀周蓮溪愛蓮說中「菊花之隱逸者也一的共鳴罷了。</p>
<p>李淸照醉花陰詞中，「莫道不銷魂，簾捲西風，人比黃花瘦」。我是近幾年來，奔波生活，多少良友，半是天涯，正感黯然魂銷者，惟別而已矣！加以十幾年來，記者生涯，俾畫作夜，人比黃花瘦，說個正着。在這花國漫步中，自然又不能不興「紈袴不餓死，儒冠多誤生」之感。</p>
<p>在主人的家園，我們暢談了兩小時，知道他爲了菊癖，今年是差不多要賠折五萬金，但是他毫不吝惜，他這種高風勁節的意態，使我確信惟此主人，才配愛菊，那些庸夫俗子，不配賞菊更不配蒔菊，多少名利人，也在菊花前，眞不知要如何慚煞。</p>
<p>主人出示，八六老人庸叟陳夔龍先生贈詩，中有「長保秋容耐歲寒」之句，余頗愛誦之，同行鶴兄覩黃園畜一白鶴，對景生悄，頗忻羨此鶴之克拿淸趣，主人復引鶴作舞，進退有序，飄飄欲仙，傍晚歸去，生平不持螯，只能把酒憶菊，旣沒有王績過酒家「眼看人盡醉，何忍獨爲醒」的豪氣，也就提起禿筆，且算我別了菊園的一些離感而已。</p>

<h3 id="c31">也談談貓 <a href="#c31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>— 史亭</p>
<p>很有人喜歡拿人跟動物來比較。於是，發出一種「人不如狗」，「人不如貓」之類的感嘆。其實，這種比較和這種感嘆都是不大必要的。</p>
<p>譬如，許席珍先生有感於在黑夜裏行路不方便，會撞到電綫木幹上去，於是，就希望這時候，自己是一只貓了。可是，待我們細細地想一想，似乎覺得有一對貓的眼睛，自然不妨，不過，澈底地成爲一隻貓，實在是要不得的</p>
<p>因爲，人之不習慣於黑暗，在某一方面講，自然不能不說是一種弱點。但是，正因爲人們是不習慣於黑暗，他們才渴求於光明；如果每個人都習慣了黑暗，還有誰再去向黑暗戰鬥，爭取光明呢？</p>
<p>是的，黑暗常常會遮掩了大地，我們須要一付像貓一樣尖銳的眼睛，在黑暗中能够看淸四周的東西，否則，我們不免要踏入汚水潭，跌進陷阱，不能防備暗中襲來的狼羣，更不能够和牠們鬥爭了。可是，我們不能成爲一隻貓，因爲貓是喜歡黑暗的，牠須要黑暗來掩飾，等待機會，獵取食物的人。如果做了黑暗中的貓，那就無異自己願意被黑暗征服了。</p>
<p>所以，我們須要貓的眼睛，可是不要成爲一隻黑暗中的貓。</p>

<p>— 之乎</p>
<p>因爲有一點緊要的事，路程雖短，我踏出門口也就喚黃包車了。</p>
<p>「兩隻洋」車夫的討價乾脆得很。我一看，原來門口就祇有這一輛黃包車，這叫「物以希爲貴」，黃包車夫是最懂得這訣竅的。</p>
<p>我還價一元，照算還是客氣的，因爲至多祇有二三條馬路，可是車夫的回答眞使人生氣，他說：「先生，你還是走走罷！」這等於魚販子嘴里的「吃不起魚問什麼價鈿」</p>
<p>我就祇能利用我的兩條腿，開大步了，但那車夫忽然趕上來，「來，來，苦生意呢！」」</p>
<p>坐上車子，我就對他說：做生意要客氣點，錢少你可以不拉。</p>
<p>那車夫倒懂得表演技術，先嘆了口氣，然後說：我們是靠跑吃飯的，今天一天你先生還是第一個生意，說了句氣話，你先生不要生氣。</p>
<p>我默然了。</p>
<h3 id="c33">三輪車 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— 文超</p>
<p>近來，滬上三輪車事業，好似很發達，過去的汽車行，經過幾次改換面目後，如今却變爲三輪車公司了。</p>
<p>目前可算是三輪車的時代吧，上海人可眞「脚」福不淺。</p>
<p>自從汽車「退伍」（不是落伍），電車幾度增價後，自行車，馬車，人力車……互相角逐，莫不欲爭取交通事業的牛耳。</p>
<p>自行車曾風行過一陣兒，但偷車之風，也遂之而起，使人頗喘喘於這「坐騎」的麻煩。馬車，是落伍者，凡是被時代淘汰的東西，休想再有翻身的日子。前些時，雖然一度活躍，但總難得出頭。因爲養一匹馬拖車子，所需的費用，不如雇一個車夫拖包車爲合算。（馬與人競爭，馬是必然失敗的，原因却是馬的身價比人高。）人力車呢，只能保持着原有的地位。</p>
<p>三輪車能爲人們所歡迎，當然由於它有着不少的優點，它是一種「時代性」，「都市性」的產物。</p>
<p>其實三輪車最大的優點，是在兩人「同車」，在情侶們是一個機會，在夫婦們是一個習慣，在朋友們可以「並膝談心」，至於老太太們，也可以多帶幾個小孫兒出遊了。</p>
<p>所以三輪車能够風行，並不是多了一個輪盤的關係，而是多了一個座位的緣故。</p>

Italian armored units also entered Nice at 1:00 PM on the same day. It is reported that they will continue to move westward.</p>
<p>Marseille, 12th (Havas dispatch) – German troops entered Marseille late last night.</p>
<p>Marseille, 12th (Havas dispatch) – German motorized units passed through the Rhone River valley yesterday evening and were originally scheduled to arrive here last night, but they only arrived this morning via the Aix road. The units included motorcycles, liaison vehicles, anti-aircraft artillery units, and transport vehicles. Various vehicles drove through the Canebière Mountains and parked in the designated barracks. No accidents occurred along the way. The streets have returned to their old appearance.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Allied News Agency dispatch) – It was officially announced today that, upon orders to cross the border into the non-occupied zone of France to protect the French Mediterranean coast against possible Allied invasion, the German anti-aircraft units have taken over all important airfields and other key points in southern France.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Allied News Agency dispatch) – According to Vichy broadcasts, German troops have arrived in the Pyrenees Mountains on the French-Spanish border and have stationed heavy troops at various operational strongholds. According to reports from Barcelona, German troops have completed their advance into several cities along the northeastern border of the Mediterranean Sea. The border area is currently not closed and the situation is relatively calm.</p>
<p>Vichy, 11th (Havas dispatch) – German troops crossed the demarcation line stipulated in the Franco-German armistice agreement this morning and entered the free zone. According to news from Berlin, Axis forces have arrived at their designated destinations in the free zone of France. However, according to French news, German troops are heading south. A large detachment of artillery and motorized units passed through the city of Limoges at noon today. By 2:00 PM, German troops had arrived in Clermont-Ferrand, near Vichy. There were also traces of armed German troops, but there were no German soldiers in the city. It is reported that German troops passed through Lyon at 1:00 PM. At 4:00 PM, German planes flew over the free zone of France, distributing Chancellor Hitler's "Letter to the French People." German troops are expected to arrive in Marseille at 9:00 PM. All entertainment venues in the city will close at 8:00 PM, and the market is deserted. German troops will enter the city tomorrow morning. In addition, Italian troops entered Nice at 4:00 PM today and landed in Bastia, Corsica.</p>
<p>Rome, 12th (Havas dispatch) – Officials announced yesterday afternoon that Italian troops had entered southern France, including Nice. The first to enter the city were motorcycle divisions. No accidents occurred.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Pétain Fully Understands German and Italian Military Measures <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Vichy, 12th (Havas dispatch) – Marshal Pétain met with Marshal von Rundstedt, Commander-in-Chief of German Forces in France, yesterday. At that time, Marshal Pétain protested the entry of German troops into free France. Paris, 12th (Havas dispatch) – Political figures here believe that General Pétain's protest against the entry of German troops into the free zone of France is only a formal gesture. Pétain fully understands the German military measures. The French government has now been allowed to exercise its political power throughout the country. Therefore, it is widely believed that the relocation of the government to Versailles or Paris will be considered from a purely military perspective.</p>
<p>Vichy, 12th (Havas dispatch) – Well-informed sources in Vichy state that after receiving a letter from Hitler, Marshal Pétain declared that the letter was from a friend, not an enemy. He will consider the suggestion that the French government relocate to Versailles. Marshal Pétain's opposition to the entry of German troops into the non-occupied zone of France is only diplomatic in nature and has no major significance. He is still maintaining the order to defend against Anglo-American attacks, showing that the French government supports the Axis powers' measures to defend against Anglo-American aggression.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Allied News Agency dispatch) – The German Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the night of the 11th regarding the entry of German troops into the non-occupied zone of France, stating: (1) French Algeria is constitutionally a part of France. The situation when the German and French governments signed the armistice agreement is fundamentally different because of the American invasion. (2) The above is only related to legal aspects, but in terms of the actual military situation, the anti-Axis forces still have the ambition to occupy Corsica and French forward bases. Germany and Italy cannot stand by and watch, not only for the security of France itself, but also for European civilization. (3) If the anti-Axis forces secure bases on the mainland, it will be difficult to avoid France becoming a battlefield again. Therefore, the French people must fully understand the purpose of Chancellor Hitler's statement. (4) In summary, whether viewed from a legal, military, or strategic point of view, the situation is fundamentally different from when Germany and France signed the armistice agreement. Before the preconditions of the armistice agreement are fully resolved, the German government can only regard Marshal Pétain's note to Germany as a purely formal legal measure. (5) It must be further stated that the German troops' entry this time is by no means an attempt to occupy all of France, but to pass through the non-occupied zone to reach the trench lines along the Mediterranean coast. Chancellor Hitler, for the sake of the security of the entire European continent, made this decision after full consultation with the governments of the Axis powers. The claim that the measures were based on the Chancellor's instructions is merely propaganda by the anti-Axis countries.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 12th (Havas dispatch) – According to news from London, the British are very angry about the German occupation of the southern coast of France.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, in 1908, Morocco experienced internal strife, and the anti-foreign sentiment among the natives was raging. Indigenous people of the Zawiya tribe killed five French citizens and three Europeans in the port of Casablanca. Due to the severity of the situation, France dispatched gunboats to bombard the port and sent 3,000 troops to occupy the port and Rabat to its north. Later, a new Sultan ascended to the throne, but his rule was ineffective. Within three years, the entire country was in rebellion, and the Sultan was besieged by rebel forces. The Sultan had no choice but to request help from France. Fearing failure, France sent 10,000 troops, defeated the rebels, and took the opportunity to occupy Fez. As a result, all important towns fell into French hands.</p>
<p>In November 1912, France and Spain signed their final agreement. The northern part of Morocco, a zone 200 miles long and 60 miles deep, was assigned to Spain. The port of Tangier and the surrounding 40 miles were designated as a neutral international zone. The rest belonged to France. The world was divided into three, bringing temporary peace. France adopted a policy of appeasement towards Morocco, similar to that in Tunisia, to avoid excessive pressure that could incite native resistance and unnecessary bloodshed. In other words, the Sultan accepted French protection, with the French Resident-General acting as the supreme government, and French civil and military officials assisting in local administration.</p>
<p>However, even this policy of appeasement did not yield immediate results. Before long, Moroccan natives revolted, killing eighty French citizens in Fez, causing unrest throughout the territory. The situation in the Spanish-controlled area was even worse, with Spanish troops being defeated by native forces. A native leader named Krim, known for his intelligence and bravery, called on the natives in the mountain region to attack foreigners and implement his "Morocco for Moroccans" policy. By 1925, his influence was at its peak, and he attempted to invade the French-occupied areas. France was terrified and had to join forces with Spain to deal with him. France even sent Marshal Pétain, the current head of state, to oversee the war. The war was unprecedented in its intensity, but unfortunately, France did not have a great writer like Rudyard Kipling to write about the colonial war in a way that was both moving and tragic. By the end of that year, the French colonial army had suffered over 11,000 casualties. In 1926, Krim was finally captured and sent to Réunion Island, and the national borders were largely pacified.</p>
<p>Morocco is a modern, classical, and barbaric country all at once. Airplanes and camel caravans exist side by side within its borders, and have done so for quite some time. They have been immersed in a thousand years of Eastern culture, while also embracing various Western peoples and cultures. The total area of the country is 431,000 square kilometers, with a population of about six million. Important cities and ports include the capital Rabat, Fez, Marrakesh, Casablanca, Meknes, Mogador, Agadir, and others. The country is rich in forests, oak trees, and livestock. The highlands are home to ancient cypress trees, with trunks towering into the sky, some reaching the height of a fourteen-story building. Some of these trees are four hundred years old. The French authorities are working hard to protect the forests, but the natives indiscriminately cut them down. Their logging method is very peculiar, using neither axes nor saws, but simply setting fire to the trunk, burning it through, and letting the tree fall on its own.</p>
<p>Although the political center of Morocco is in Rabat, where the French Resident-General resides, Muslim native chiefs prefer to live in Marrakesh. The city's buildings are all painted red, earning it the name "Red City." The city boasts nine hundred palm trees, with red and green intertwined, creating a beautiful sight. Throughout the cities, Muslim mosques stand tall, and the natives are devout in their Islamic faith, praying, "There is only one God, and Muhammad is His prophet." In Rabat, when the Sultan prays on Fridays, there is a grand procession, with people cheering along the way, a truly magnificent sight.</p>
<p>The interior of Morocco is home to many large and small chiefs, each living in fortresses or camps, forming their own little worlds. Larger chiefs often have many wives and concubines, as well as numerous servants, and own tens of thousands of horses, cattle, and sheep. The natives live separately in their respective territories, with Berbers predominating in the mountains and Arabs and Moors predominating in the plains. Moroccans are known for their strength, love of fighting, and fearlessness of death. They often rebel against their chiefs and Sultans, let alone foreigners. Therefore, even today, lone foreigners dare not venture deep into the interior. However, Moroccans who enlist in the French colonial army are renowned for their bravery and skill in battle.</p>
<p>Berber men are all thin and wiry, but their movements are exceptionally agile. The women reveal their beautiful dark eyes, full of passionate charm. They are more open-minded than their Muslim sisters elsewhere, not wearing veils and managing household affairs, being true virtuous wives and good mothers, and also possessing considerable property rights. If it weren't for the harsh African sun, their skin would be very fair, as they are of partly Caucasian descent.</p>
<p>The international commercial port of Morocco shares similarities with the cosmopolitan city of Shanghai. In the marketplaces of Moroccan cities, one can find scenes reminiscent of the Shanghai City God Temple or the Great World amusement center. During the day, there are all sorts of lively entertainment venues. Snake charmers, dancers, magicians, opera singers, storytellers – you name it, they have it. They don't sell tickets, relying entirely on voluntary contributions. Spectators, regardless of gender, status, or age, enjoy the performances on an equal footing, making it a truly typical entertainment venue for the masses. However, this kind of limited outlook and peaceful situation cannot be maintained anymore. Allied forces have already landed on the coast of Morocco. If Morocco falls, not only will French North Africa be unreliable, but even Dakar in West Africa will be in imminent danger.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office - Specific Plan for Sugar Distribution Based on Population - One Pound per Household Head and Half a Pound per Person per Month Planned for Implementation Next Month - Temporary Retail Sales Starting Today Based on House Tax Receipts or Citizen ID <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office, in view of the fact that after the implementation of the method of purchasing sugar with citizen ID cards, congestion in purchasing sugar still exists, and there are even situations of speculative buying and profiteering, which is contrary to the original intention of maintaining people's livelihood and popularizing sugar purchase, has now revised the method of issuing sugar and formulated "Temporary Measures for Temporary Door-to-Door Sugar Sales," which will be implemented from today. It is stipulated that purchase should be based on house tax receipts, limited to one purchase per month, with a limit of 5 to 25 yuan in Central Reserve Notes. If it is not enough, one can purchase one yuan per person each time with a citizen ID. At the same time, a new system of sugar distribution based on population is being planned, and specific measures are being studied. According to reliable news obtained by our reporter from the office yesterday, the new system of sugar distribution based on population will be implemented from December 1 after the research is completed and approved by the authorities. It is heard that it will be stipulated that each household head will be given one catty of sugar per month, and each person will be given half a catty of sugar per month, extrapolated based on the population. The method of issuing sugar purchase certificates will be cooperated with the concession authorities, modeled after the method of grain distribution based on population. After the implementation of sugar distribution based on population, the temporary door-to-door sugar sales measures will be cancelled.</p>
<p>Limited to 25 Yuan per Household</p>
<p>The Shanghai Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office has temporarily revised the temporary measures for door-to-door sugar sales. (1) Retailers selling sugar door-to-door are divided into two types. The first type is designated stores selling sugar with house tax receipts. Households can purchase from these stores with their house tax receipts, limited to 5 to 25 yuan in Central Reserve Notes, with red and white sugar sold together (still according to the previous method, one small package every five yuan, calculated according to the official sugar price, including 2% retail tax). Limited to once per month, and no further purchase is allowed from any store. After purchasing, each household should distribute the sugar evenly among the entire family. If it is not enough, it can be purchased from the second type of retail store. The second type is designated stores selling sugar with citizen ID cards. Households can purchase from these stores with their citizen ID cards, limited to one yuan per person each time. (2) The house tax receipts held by households are stipulated as follows:</p>
<p>A. Residents of the International Settlement, Hongkou, the Southern City of Shanghai, Zhabei, and the northwest of Pudong should all use this year's autumn house tax receipts.</p>
<p>B. Residents of the French Concession must use the September-October house tax receipts.</p>
<p>C. The above house tax receipts are universally applicable for purchase from designated retail stores within the distribution range of this office, but monthly and quarterly receipts cannot be used interchangeably.</p>
<p>D. When purchasing, the supervising staff will stamp the back blank corner of the tax receipt with the words "Sugar Paid," indicating the limit.</p>
<p>Business Needs - Apply According to Law</p>
<p>(3) Stores designated to sell sugar with house tax receipts shall no longer sell with citizen ID cards, and stores designated to sell sugar with citizen ID cards shall no longer sell with house tax receipts. (4) All stores selling sugar with house tax receipts or citizen ID cards will have the designation of this office posted at the door for easy identification. (5) The amount of sugar sold by each retail store each day will still be in accordance with the regulations of this office, based on one-thirtieth of the October allocation and the sugar previously stored, until the quota is full. If less than one-thirtieth is sold, it will be included in the sales for the next day, and so on. (6) Restaurants,菜館 and other food stores that need sugar for business purposes, and whose purchases according to the above methods are insufficient, may apply to this office through their respective trade associations. After review and approval, a purchase certificate will be issued to purchase from designated retail stores. (Five yuan, measured by balance, including tax) One catty and two taels of white sugar, one catty and three taels of red and green sugar, fifteen taels and two qian of rock sugar.</p>
<p>(One yuan, measured by balance) Three taels and seven qian of white sugar, three taels and nine qian of red and green sugar, three taels and one qian of rock sugar.</p>
<p>Sugar Stores Divided into Two Categories</p>
<p>There are 96 Class A retail stores with a monthly allocation of more than 30 packages. From today, they will all post a white sign with red characters "Shanghai Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office Designated Retailer for Sugar Sales with House Tax Receipts." There are more than 300 small retail stores with a monthly allocation of less than 30 packages. From today, they will all post a white sign with red characters "Shanghai Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office Designated Retailer for Sugar Sales with Citizen ID Cards Limited to One Yuan in Central Reserve Notes." At the same time, the cooperative office will send supervising staff to be stationed or rotate to supervise the distribution. The total amount of sugar allocated for this month has been determined to be 25,000 packages, with 70% allocated to households in front of Class A retail stores and 30% allocated to restaurants and other food stores for business needs. The office has already moved the sugar to be allocated to the office warehouse, and it will be issued to Class A and B merchants in about 20 days.</p>

<p>— Zhou</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the anniversary of the Premier's birth, I stole half a day to go to Huang Garden to appreciate chrysanthemums, inevitably giving the impression of a vulgar person pretending to be refined.</p>
<p>Walking through winding paths, I unexpectedly found a secluded place. Arriving at Huang Garden, thousands of loads of worldly dust were naturally washed away. The owner, Mr. Huang Yuezhou, personally managed the flowers, and his high spirits were as before. Gazing at the rocky mountain and admiring the autumn chrysanthemums, I suddenly recalled Guan Xiu's poem, "The lotus is so deep that it seems like entering the Shaoxi Road, the strange rocks make me suspect that I am walking in the Yandang Mountains. I am only afraid that the Central Plains is in turmoil, and Heaven's will does not allow the host to be idle." It seems very fitting to give to the host as well. I am merely looking at the chrysanthemums with the sympathy that they brave the severe frost and their firm integrity is commendable. Of course, I do not understand the varieties. I do not know the preciousness of Phoenix Claws and Starry Sky. I only see the yellow flowers floating gracefully, unlike ordinary ones, which I consider to be a resonance with Zhou Lianxi's "Chrysanthemum is the recluse of flowers" in On the Love of Lotus.</p>
<p>In Li Qingzhao's Drunken Flowers, "Do not say that it does not break the heart, the curtain is rolled up by the west wind, and the person is thinner than the yellow flower." In recent years, I have been rushing about in life, and many good friends are halfway across the world. I am feeling sad and heartbroken, only parting! In addition, in the reporter's career for more than ten years, working day and night, the person is thinner than the yellow flower, which is quite accurate. Walking in this flower country, I naturally cannot help but feel "the rich and powerful do not die of hunger, but scholars are misled in life."</p>
<p>At the host's home, we talked for two hours, knowing that he would lose nearly 50,000 yuan this year for his chrysanthemum addiction, but he does not hesitate at all. His noble and firm integrity makes me sure that only this host is worthy of loving chrysanthemums. Those mediocre and vulgar people are not worthy of appreciating chrysanthemums, let alone cultivating them. Many people of fame and fortune are truly ashamed in front of chrysanthemums.</p>
<p>The host showed a poem presented by the eighty-six-year-old Yongsou Mr. Chen Kuilong, which contains the sentence "Maintaining autumn beauty in the face of cold weather." I quite like to recite it. My companion, Brother He, saw a white crane raised in Huang Garden, and was quietly moved by the scene, quite envious of the crane's ability to capture pure interest. The host then led the crane to dance, with orderly advances and retreats, ethereal and immortal. Returning in the evening, I have never held a crab, so I can only drink wine and recall chrysanthemums. Since I do not have Wang Ji's heroic spirit of "Seeing people all drunk, how can I bear to be awake alone" when passing by a wine shop, I will pick up my bald pen and consider it as a parting feeling from the chrysanthemum garden.</p>

Her brushwork has a unique quality and does not follow the beaten path of previous artists. She is especially adept at integrating poetic sentiment into her paintings. Viewing Miss Wang's works evokes a sense of holding Tao Yuanming's poems. Her profound artistic accomplishment is beyond that of ordinary individuals. To raise funds for the Shanghai Infant Education and Care Institute, she is holding a solo exhibition of over 200 meticulously created paintings from recent years at the Daxon Department Store Art Gallery on the 16th of this month.

<h3 id="e31">Talking About Cats <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>– Shi Ting</p>
<p>Many people like to compare humans with animals. As a result, exclamations such as "Humans are inferior to dogs" and "Humans are inferior to cats" arise. In fact, this comparison and this exclamation are largely unnecessary.</p>
<p>For example, Mr. Xu Xizhen, feeling inconvenienced by walking in the dark and bumping into telephone poles, hopes that he could be a cat at such times. However, when we think about it carefully, it seems that having a pair of cat's eyes is naturally fine, but completely becoming a cat is really undesirable.</p>
<p>Because, in a certain sense, people's unaccustomed to darkness is indeed a weakness. However, precisely because people are not accustomed to darkness, they yearn for light. If everyone were accustomed to darkness, who would fight against darkness and strive for light?</p>
<p>Yes, darkness often obscures the earth. We need a pair of sharp eyes like a cat's to be able to see clearly the things around us in the dark. Otherwise, we will inevitably step into puddles of sewage, fall into traps, be unable to defend against the wolf packs attacking from the dark, and even less be able to fight with them. However, we cannot become a cat, because cats like darkness; they need darkness to conceal themselves, wait for opportunities, and hunt for food. If we become a cat in the dark, it is tantamount to willingly being conquered by darkness.</p>
<p>Therefore, we need the eyes of a cat, but we must not become a cat in the dark.</p>

<p>— Zhi Hu</p>
<p>Because I had something important to do, though the distance was short, I hailed a rickshaw as soon as I stepped out the door.</p>
<p>"Two oceans" - the rickshaw puller's bargaining was very straightforward. I looked and saw that there was only this one rickshaw at the door. This is called "scarcity makes it precious". Rickshaw pullers understand this trick best.</p>
<p>I bargained down to one yuan, which I considered polite, as it was at most only two or three blocks. However, the rickshaw puller's reply was truly infuriating. He said, "Sir, you should walk instead!" This is equivalent to the fishmonger's "If you can't afford fish, why ask the price?"</p>
<p>I could only use my two legs and start striding. But the rickshaw puller suddenly caught up and said, "Come, come, it's a hard business!"</p>
<p>After getting on the rickshaw, I said to him: You should be more polite when doing business. You can choose not to pull if the money is too little.</p>
<p>The rickshaw puller knew how to put on an act. He first sighed, then said: We rely on pulling for our livelihood. Today, you are the first customer, sir. Please don't be angry that I said something offensive.</p>
<p>I remained silent.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Tricycles <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Chao</p>
<p>Recently, the tricycle business in Shanghai seems to be very developed. The former car dealerships have undergone several changes and are now tricycle companies.</p>
<p>Currently, it can be said that it is the era of tricycles. The people of Shanghai are truly blessed with feet.</p>
<p>Since cars "retired" (not obsolete), and tram fares have increased several times, bicycles, carriages, rickshaws... compete with each other, all wanting to win the leader in the transportation business.</p>
<p>Bicycles were popular for a while, but the trend of stealing bicycles also rose, making people quite worried about the troubles of this "mount." Carriages are obsolete. Anything eliminated by the times can never expect to make a comeback. Although they were active for a while, they were always difficult to stand out. Because the cost of raising a horse to pull a carriage is not as cost-effective as hiring a rickshaw puller to pull a rickshaw. (In the competition between horses and humans, horses are bound to fail because the value of a horse is higher than that of a human.) Rickshaws can only maintain their original position.</p>
<p>Tricycles are welcomed by people, of course, because they have many advantages. It is a product of "modernity" and "urbanity".</p>
<p>In fact, the biggest advantage of tricycles is that two people can "share the ride." For couples, it is an opportunity; for husbands and wives, it is a habit; for friends, they can "chat side by side." As for old ladies, they can also bring a few more grandchildren out for a stroll.</p>
<p>Therefore, the reason why tricycles can be popular is not because of the addition of a wheel, but because of the addition of a seat.</p>

<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(11) The Enemy</p>
<p>Huang Long asked: "Going out for a trip, where to?" Wei Cheng said: "Where to go, I haven't decided yet, but I'm going out with you anyway. You need to know, why go out during the Lunar New Year? Because if we go out during the Lunar New Year, my aunt won't suspect we're doing anything earth-shattering. I also anticipate that if I ask my aunt for a hundred or two hundred dollars to gamble or spend, she'll think that it's only a few major holidays in a year, and she'll generously agree. We take the money..." Huang Long said: "With money, we don't need anything else. I have a knife. With a knife, we don't need a gun. If we carry a gun, we'll be charged if it's found. A knife is not like a gun. Even if it's found, the knife is confiscated, then I still have two fists. Fists can also take lives, just like in the case of Wei Shaoyun!" Wei Cheng was startled, hurriedly shook his head, looked up at the rafters, and then stared at the small holes in the clam shell window, saying "You can't name names." Huang Long smiled and said: "Sorry, I forgot again. My words are the truth. Now it's your turn to speak, where do you say we're going with the money?" Wei Cheng said: "I'm planning to go to at least three places. This Cheng Bing, he's originally from Ant Mound Town, so first we should go to Ant Mound Town. When we get to the town, we first find out where this Cheng Bing went, whether he changed his surname to Chen. If this Cheng Bing has moved, or someone knows that he changed his surname to Chen, then it's almost certain. We quickly go to Shuangqiao Town to find Old Lady Chen. Old Lady Chen is the grandmother of Chen Guoqi and Chen Guofang. Their ancestral home is now in Shuangqiao Town. I and Ah Xing have both been there. As long as we go to Old Lady Chen's place, we'll ask him with lightning speed. If we find out, then it's almost certain. We quickly go to Shanghai to find the Chen siblings. With a brother, there is a sister, and with a sister, there is a brother. With these siblings, there is their father. At that time, we won't care about anything else. We'll just recognize him as the enemy, and we won't ask what his status is, what kind of power he has. White knives go in, red knives come out, that's what I've decided." As Wei Cheng spoke, he gritted his teeth and punched the table with his fist. The water in the water bowl on the table splashed out, showing that Wei Cheng was extremely sad and indignant. (228)</p>
