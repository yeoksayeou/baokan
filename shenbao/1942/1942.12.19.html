<p>社評</p>
<h3>上海教育問題</h3>
<p>上海本來是全國文化中心，而敎育更特別發達，從小學到大學，在學校的數量，學生的人數，和一切設備與設施方面，都佔全國第一位。所培養出來的人才，數十年中，也不知有多少了。不過，自從中日事變以來，上海的敎育，也跟着整個文化的停滯而陷入了甚苦悶的境地，這種新的趨勢，有着兩種不同的意義：</p>
<p>第一，過去上海的敎育，老實說，是充溢着英美帝國主義者在殖民地上實施的奴化敎育的意味，雖然在方法上，曾經有過許多改良運動，什麼實騐主義的敎育，什麼道爾頓制的敎育，而在敎育的內容和目的說，主要的不是爲着替本國培養建設人才，而只是爲着英美帝國主義者在中國的殖民地性的權益而製迭買辦，和英美帝國主義的工具而已！在這幾十年來，中國有新敎育，固然不得不算是拜受「歐風美雨」之賜，但是這種新敎育却同時帶來了新桎梏，其間不知曾經犧牲了多少人才，中日事變以後，特別是去年十二月八日以後，英美帝國主義在華勢力開始總崩潰，把上海敎育的積年桎梏打破了。同時，由於事變，一部份學校和敎師已經離開上海了，本來分佈在上海附近小城市的學校，這幾年來也因環境關係而躱避到孤島上來，這樣，在數量上說，上海的敎育並不比事變以前少，也許還是增加了；可是，從質量上說，無疑的是大大的降落了！加以上海的經濟情形，已和數年前不同，每一個市民都痛感生活負擔的增重，影響到敎育方面，便是大多數有經騐有地位的敎育工作人員，不得不改業從商，或兼營他業，不能專心於神聖的敎育事業；而不少原非敎育工作人員，都又以敎育事業爲營利工具，而利用種種各義開創或接辦各級學校，他們目的只在營利，當然對於「敎育」的神聖使命是不會顧到的。這種情形，不能不令人發生脫去了舊的牢籠，陷入了新的桎梏之憾！</p>
<p>這種新的危機，近來似乎已經開始爲當局和各方面所注意，因此談論上海敎育問題的文章，也常常在報章上露面了！我們認爲這是一個非常重要的問題，而且是關係着中國未來的前途太大了，不僅當局應該以遠大的目光，坦白熱誠以謀中國敎育獨立發展的態度，與各方面專家進行認眞切實的商討，同時，我們希望上海的敎育界，認淸自己的責任，認淸目己出來說話的權利和可能發生的作用，而從中國前途的遠景着眼，提出具體的意見來。</p>
<p>至於目前上海敎育問題的解決，以我們的淺見所及，認爲下列幾點是相當重要的。　首先，針對目前上海敎育界普遍的不安定的實際情形，設法使之安定起來，尤其是具有歷史的大中小學和專門學校，務使主持者和敎職員都能安心於維持學校，安心於繼續敎育工作，而不作他想。同時，努力替敎育界消除不安定的因素，如在政治方面，保障敎職員的生活安全，以及保障一切合法學校與敎育機關的公開活動，而在社會方面，輿論方面，更多方面的給敎育界以協助，及對敎師與敎育工作者表示必要的尊敬等都是。</p>
<p>其次，在安定時間內，還要努力使學生都能認眞讀書，讀有利於發揮學生天才以進而服務於人羣社會的　，這裏，一方面是大量和精密地編製敎科書與補充讀物，在過渡時期，對於坊間原有敎科書，應加以審定，准其暫爲應用，以補救目前若干學校因敎本缺乏而至於東拉西扯，使學生學無所得的痛心現象；另一方面，則改善現在—其實是多年積習下來的學校敎育制度，相當校正各科的分量，减去或减少不必要的科目，以减輕學生的負担，而得專心於主要和必要科目的學習，不致終日似還債式與囫　呑棗式的學習，而實際上對於各科部茫無所知。</p>
<p>最後，也是很重要的，是（一）對於敎職員生活的輔助，目前敎職員生活之困苦，有非一般飽食暖衣者所能想像者；這樣困苦的結果，迫使良好敎職員離開本職，而降低了師資的水準！這是非常嚴重的問題！近來社會上熱心人士，有見於此，已有種種補助敎員生活的義舉，但是還嫌不能普遍，而且數目也太少了！我們一方面希望當局決定統一的計劃，確定一定的款項，同時希望社會上造成一種以捐資補助敎職員生活爲最大光榮的風氣。（二）是救濟貧苦學生，現在學生求學所有負担之重，幾乎小學費用足够從前的大學，中學所費已够數年前留學了！可是，一般中等以下的家長，尤其是廣大的薪水階級，他們的收入却爲數有限得很！結果便只有忍痛讓目己的子女輟學了！這是社會也是國家的損失！也是大家所不應忽視的！希望當局和各級學校當局，協議增加免費减費的學額。同時，社會各界領袖，則努力推進救濟貧苦學生的運動，雙管齊下，或者對於今後上海敎育，會有重大的貢獻！</p>

<h3>减輕可能之遭遇　滬市居民必須警戒　軍事當局將竭力解除空襲可能性　工部局總巡渡正監談話</h3>
<p>第二次防空管制訓練、現正賡續進行中、工部局總巡渡正監、昨爲進一步督促人民注意及此、特發表談話謂、「上海居民如欲减輕上海可能遭遇空襲之危險、須採取一切警戒步驟、保護自身幷須竭力遵從當局所發之訓令、憶一九三七年時、有炸彈墜落租界、生命財產遭損失、此爲歷史敎訓、人民務須防其重現、過去此事之發生、原因在於公共機關間完全缺少組織與合作、現在此事已爲陳跡、蓋上海人民己深知自身應負之責任、余對於人民與當局之相互諒解及協同深表欣慰、尙望各界人士努力自衛自保，而對於各種有關之訓令、更宜硏究、以便澈底瞭解」、</p>
<p>上海已在　戰時情形</p>
<p>渡總巡繼請、渠於防空演習之夜、親自赴百老匯大厦及永安公司樓上觀望、一般情形較之上次大有進步、在西虹口區、若干處情形則「極壞」公共租界其他各區、成績完全滿意、夫在防空期內、人民務須絕對自動、蓋上海已在戰時情形、故空襲非不可能、但軍事當局將竭其可能、解除此種可能性、</p>
<p>防範辦法　澈底訓練</p>
<p>查上次舉行防空演習、目的僅在燈火管制、現在情形逈異、全市人均須澈底訓練、以對付來自上空之危機、故此次訓練範圍較廣、因此人民更須遵從當局之命令、試以學校言、所有中小學學生必須敎以空襲時防範之方法、而合宜之避難所及救護所亦須設立、他如滅火撲滅燃燒彈及救護工作、亦應注意及之、保甲人員及自警團須負敎導人民之責、總巡復稱、上海缺少普通撲滅燃燒彈所需之黃沙、但潮濕之衣服同樣有效、</p>
<p>罪案减少　有賴保甲</p>
<p>又據另稱、四十五萬名保甲人員、　及十七萬自警員、業已證實對公共租界秩序與安寗之維持、有巨大效果、而對於防空演習之工作、對警務處亦有極大之幫助、公共租界於一九四一年、每月平均發生刦盜案一百二十起、一部分市民常遭受恐怖、自一九四二年五月起、直至現時爲止、即由每月一百二十起至每月一次或二次、據云部分原因、乃由於保甲及自警員之努力一九四一年上海民衆對罪案不合作之現象、至今業已轉變、每一居民、均已樂於趨入調和狀態中、</p>
<p>繼續管制</p>
<p>又悉、防空管制日來繼續進行、全市尙在警戒狀態中、望人民隨時注意空戲警報、採取適當之步驟、各組保甲人員之工作、仍繼續進行不息、</p>
<h3>自用燈光　須嚴格遮蔽</h3>
<p>法租界當局布吿居民注意、此後數日中、尙有警戒警報若于次、而路燈照常開放、但在此警戒期間、各私人住宅商店私路里弄中之燈光、則仍須嚴格與以遮蔽、仰各凛遵、</p>

<h3>聞蘭亭氏病愈出院</h3>
<p>聞蘭亭氏此次患病就醫、頗爲社會人士所關切、關於病狀及治療經過、已迭誌各報、聞氏就醫迄今、轉瞬二月餘、十年宿疾、一旦消失、其愉快爲何如、記者不惟爲聞氏慶、且爲上海社會前途慶、良以聞氏熱心公益、數十年如一日、貢獻於社會者至多、平時忙於處理公務、致所患疾病、不遑就治、二個月前、以積勞過甚、所患攝護腺肥大症漸劇、溺尿不能、始行就醫、在就醫期間、所有社會公益事務、不無影響、茲已回復十年前之健康、業於昨日全愈出院、而目前社會事務、正待聞氏以老當益壯之精神、繼續處理之、茲將聞氏患病及洽療經過情形、詳記於后、當爲社會關心者所樂聞焉、</p>
<p>患病情形</p>
<p>聞氏所患爲老年性攝護腺肥大症、已有近十年之久、十年前每夜小便一次、五年前每夜二三次、二年來每夜竟至五六次、日間次數亦增加、尿量不多、而次數迭增、最近排尿漸感不利、甚且不能、按攝護腺肥大症、中醫謂之癃閉、大率年高者因睪丸內分泌缺乏、攝護腺因而逐漸肥大、致尿道及膀胱之口、遭受擠逼、排尿困難、輕者小便無力、餘滴不盡、重者溺尿不暢、循至閉塞、如不施以適當治療、即有生命之虞、聞氏年已七十有三、近年處理社會事務、異常繁劇、與此病之搆成、頗有關係、</p>
<p>治療經過</p>
<p>聞氏本爲上海南洋醫院董事長、旣因排尿不能、深感痛苦、乃於十月八日進該醫院診治、由泌尿科主任陳邦典醫師主治、當即爲之導尿、放尿後、聞氏出院準備一切、翌日即住院、以期根治、初用導尿管放入尿道內、以資排泄、並先後注射睪丸內分泌製劑十餘針、同時試用中藥、但均難收效、嗣經各醫師愼重討論之下、認定此病之治療、非施行手術不爲功、乃於十月十六日上午、由陳醫師用局部麻醉、先施行　精管截斷術、以防在治療中發生副睪丸炎、並經一次將導尿管取出後、作排尿試騐、均歸無效、聞氏即毅然決定依照各醫師之建議、作澈底之治療、遂於二十五日上午、由陳邦典醫師主持、並會同高日枚王以敬諸醫師、用脊髓麻醉、施行攝護腺截除術、歷一小時手術後、即輸血三百西西、經過良好、第三四日略有熱度、最高攝氏三七·九、旋即退熱、迨後雖稍有不舒適處、　經諸醫師及護士等悉心調護、即入佳境、腹部創口漸合、迄十一月二十日起、能由尿道自行小便、尿量亦逐漸增加、距離時間亦逐漸延長、至十二月八日、能起床、十一日能散步、十八日遂步行出院、</p>
<p>按聞氏於就痊數日間、精神非常快慰、對於該醫院　諸器師及護士辦事員等、深表感謝、並於出院時、筦爾而笑曰、「我二月前步行進院、經多次手術、幸告痊可、今日出院、居然也能步行、而溺尿之順利、尤為十年來所未有、真出乎意料、而令人欣喜不止也、」聞氏交遊極廣、住院時、探望者日以數百計、茲聞痊愈出院、莫不稱慶、或謂聞氏得天獨厚、一生行善、天之所以報施善人、亦可鑒已、</p>
<p>糧食問題諭壇（一）</p>
<p>— 李然</p>
<p>關於消除非法利潤切實可行的有效辦法，便是運用保甲機構創設消費合作社，合作社的功用，在使生活必需物資，在極合經濟條件的辦法下面，到達眞正消費者的手內，現在如能運用保甲機構來辦理，更加可以發揮它的理想的美滿功效，譬如現在食糧發生問題，這一個保甲合作社便可以根據本區人數，和其不足的數量，向有關當局請領採辦證，直接到低價的產地，採辦來按口分配，當局在沒有增加戶口米配給量之前，對於保甲合作　採辦其適在需要的食糧諒來必能表示同情，給予方便的。</p>
<p>保甲合作社的組織大綱略舉如下，（一）定名·上海〇〇區保甲消費合作總社或上海〇〇區〇聯〇保消費合作社，（二）組織·一，總社由區會委員及聯保長爲當然理事，負向產地或生產者採辦本區住戶日用必需物品分配於各社之責，二，分社以一保爲單位，正副保甲長爲分社之當然理事，負向總社批購本保各住戶日用必需物品分配於各住戶之責，其數量按人口平均計算，（三）業務·一，每一消費者概須認繳社股十元，作為採辦物品之資本，不足之數，由理事負責設法挪借，消費者以戶爲單位，得於一定期內以現款向社購取該期應可分配之物品，二分社向總社批購物品，亦以現款交易，三，總社批發物品，按照採辦成本加假定利潤百分之十計算，分社售出物品，按照批價加百之廿計算，四，社中理事及辦事員等，概爲義務職，五，假定利潤之款除去借款利息及物品損耗之補償外，按照消費戶某一時期內消費量比例攤還之。</p>
<p>合作社的特點，其一，需用物品直接向產地或生產者採辦，可以免去中間商人的層層剝削，其二，現款交易，可以免去經營者的危險，其三，盈利之數按服消費數量攤還給消費人，這樣消費人出的錢沒有一分是無謂的浪費，現在由保甲機構來辦理合作社，一切物品都按人口平均分配，又可以免去貧富不均現象，而且又不妨害當局計口配給的制度。</p>
<p>（二）閑閑</p>
<p>上海米糧問題，解決愈速愈好，我想了一個辦法，請大家討論。</p>
<p>（一）由上海各同業公會聯合組織一個購糧團體，請准當局，作爲輔助戶口米機關。</p>
<p>（二）此項購糧資本，由各同業公會擔保，向各銀行以極輕利息借用。</p>
<p>（三）此項輔助戶口米，無庸另設機關發售，可由各發售戶口米之米店，隨戶口米票，每票准隨購輔助米六斤，（即一人六日之食米）或三升半。</p>
<p>（四）如購米因有特殊情形，不足上述數量，（即每票六斤）可酌量配給麵粉與主要雜糧。</p>
<p>總之，計口授糧，原是預防囤積，並非令市民挨餓，現在十日一次的戶口米，只是四日的食糧，市民自己起來想法救濟，我想賢明慈悲的當局，是不能不允許的。</p>

<h3>油糖分配　不患寡而患不均</h3>
<p>油糖分配，近皆將採用房捐票購買制度，此在未能辦理按口支配前，似乎在出售方面，不失爲一臨時辦法，以待善後，然糖憑房捐票買，而二房東能照常分給三房客者，恐爲少數，無糖在中國人大多數生活中，尙不至十分感覺困難，若油亦憑房捐票買，而二房東仍如糖占爲一已享用之權利，則不平之氣雖不得發，勢將瀰漫於人心中。</p>
<p>且據讀者報吿，竟有用房捐票購得之糖，用黑市高價，轉售於需要者，不以分給三房客，雖不分給三房客，可向食糖配給處吿發，一則同處一室，三房客究不欲多得罪二房東，免生將來之糾紛，二則亦有不少三房客，向二房東要求派糖，而致相駡毆打，三則食糖配給處究非工部局警察署之公吿可比，有此三因、二房東明知三房客無如之何，落得勿分。</p>
<p>在二房東以爲我出錢，我軋來，再分給三房客，不無義務太重，不念三房客並非白吃二房東的糖，仍出相當公允之代價，二房東如嫌軋糖困難，墊款討厭，則亦無妨由三房客輪流去買，公平分派，如此則權利義務均等，何說之有，若油亦用房捐票買，二房東雖欲分配給三房客，更感不易，不分配，難道如糖之一人獨呑，於人情似乎說不過去，亦非當局分配之原意。</p>
<p>惟油糖零售商倒是贊成分配越糢糊越好，可是最好辦法，油糖分配，臨時發給一購買證，以戶爲單位，此之謂戶，係指正戶附戶而言，如專指正戶又將與房捐票購買何異，每戶以人口之多寡，定其數量之多寡，有謂如是則計算費時，誠然，但爲分配公允起見，不得不爾。</p>
<p>然在供給量未充沛及初辦之際不妨量加變通，將每戶之人口分爲若干級，以三爲一單位，每單位應配給若干，由工部局按期斟酌供求量公定之正附戶應得之配給量，按照登記之人口計算，油糖分爲兩證，爲節省印費，每紙將其按月應購之期數劃成幾格，購買一次，打去一格，一紙可用數月，如此則數量雖少，而分配普遍公允，人心自平，「不患寡而患不均，」此談分配者不可不注意及之，若照房捐票辦法，只有二房東零售商占便宜，流弊不可不防。</p>

<h3>新亞藥廠增資</h3>

<p>該廠爲表示財政公開起見、特委託專家審查、據實估計、編製資產負債表、及財產實况表、並經王海帆會計師查核證明、其正副本均分存經募溢價股票之各銀行公司中、以供認股人隨時查閱、據悉該廠資產負債表、仍以三十一年十月底之簿値計算、而市値則計九千二百餘萬元、再如此次增資實收現款約三千萬元左右、其資產總値合計爲一萬二千餘萬元、</p>
<p>該廠增資後之資本總額爲三千萬元、分爲三百萬股、每股十元、而其資產總値爲一萬二千餘萬元、以一萬二千餘萬元之資產總値、按照三百萬股分配、則預測該廠新股每股之價値當在四十元以上由是以觀、該廠此次每股溢價十七元五角、連票面共計二十七元五角、所定發行價格、尙較實際價値低廉甚多、故新亞藥廠之溢價股票、當爲投資者所値得認購之股票、</p>

<h3>記金聖嘆逸事</h3>
<p>— 史</p>
<p>命名以孔子自况　明宋淸初的文學批評家金聖嘆，乃一滑稽怪才，相傳會作「下祭彈文」譏吳中諸生云，天將晚，祭記了。忽聽得西廊下，吵吵鬧鬧爭胙肉的你瘦我肥，爭饅頭的你大我小。顏回德行人，見了微微笑。子路好男者，見了心焦躁。夫子喟然嘆曰：我也在陳絕糧，幾會見　餓莩。一他取了此意便自名爲聖嘆，恐怕是在痛哭庸俗的秀才們。</p>
<p>不愛錢財　聖嘆幼時家貧。親朋多凋謝，但是他一生却最恨守財奴。廖燕的學嘆傳載其不愛錢財云「生平與王斷山交最善斵山固俠者流，一日以三千金與先生曰：一君以此權子母，母後仍歸我，子則爲君助燈火，可乎？」先生應諾甫越月，已揮霍贻盡。乃語　山曰：「此物留君家，適增守財奴名，吾已爲君遺之矣！」斷山一笑置之！由此可以看出聖嘆的輕財。他又在評水滸傳時，論到好看錢說：「人之所以必要錢者，以錢能使人好看也。人以錢爲命而有錢時以錢與人者，旣要好看，便不復顧錢也，乃世有守錢成癖，而不要好看者，斯文一類也矣」。</p>
<p>史記只是酒肉賬簿　聖嘆是一個怪才異人，論史他很贊美始皇的焚書。他在水滸傳卷有的評示內說「……破道與治，是橫義也，橫議則烏得不燒，橫議之人則烏得不誅！故秦人燒書，非獨始皇之志，亦仲尼之志，乃仲尼不燒，而始皇燒者，仲尼不但無作書之功，兼也無燒書之權也？若始皇燒書而並燒聖經，則是雖有其權，而實無共德。實無其故，則不知其故斯盡燒矣。故並燒聖經者，始皇之罪也。燒書，始皇之功也。」而論文則推作水滸傳的施耐菴，於三千年中，獨以才子許施一人。對於太史公約史語，只當是酒肉賬簿，够不上説是絶世奇文，至於韓昌黎書記，直是印版文字，更不足道，寡是輕視退之到了極點。反之，他便推崇施耐菴到了極點。</p>
<p>砍頭　快事　聖嘆恃才傲物，以哭廟事遭誅。在臨刑時他還口授他的兒子一聯：「蓮子心中苦，梨兒腹內酸。「蓮」與「憐」同音，「梨一在吳語近「麟」。是在借物以表示他胸中的酸苦。雖然這樣，而在臨刑時尙嘆曰：「砍頭是最快事，不意於無意中得之！」可算能作鎭定語者。現在讀了他棄市日寄妻子的信「字付大兒看，鹽采與黃豆同吃，大有胡桃滋味，此法一傳，吾無遺憾矣」可知他是比稽康臨刑時的作「廣陵散」嘆者，更覺心中坦蕩呢。</p>
<p>駁好色而不淫　明末淸初，八股文盛行，而聖嘆終是一個，「叛徒」他雖然也讀毛詩和孟子，但不以塾師之言爲滿。比如前人謂「國風」是好色而不淫，他却認爲「淫即好色」，他在西廂記酬簡的總評中說：「憶，異者！好色與淫，相去却又有幾何也，若以爲發乎情，止於禮，發乎情之謂好色，止乎醴之謂不淫，如是解者，則我十歲初受毛詩，鄉塾之師，早已頁之。吾亦豈未之聞？亦豈聞之而遽忘之？固不能解好色之也；必如之何者，謂之「好色好色」，又必如之何者，謂之「淫好色」。又如之何謂之「幾於淫；　率輕有禮，以不至於一淫好色一又如之何謂之有輕禮，得以不至於淫而遂不妨其好色。夫好色而曰我不淫，是必其未　好色者也」。好色而曰吾畏於禮而不敢淫，是必其並不敢好色者也」。他的認識雖爲怪論，然而實開了近代以戀愛說詩的先河他在西廂記中，處處斥道學君子之但見汚穢而不見文學，在今日讀之，更覺痛快，惜乎他的時代不同，雖然當日認定水滸的淫亂即是國風的好色，水滸的殺人即是春秋的弒奪，但是也不過自具其理，自圓共說，也不免震驚流俗呢？</p>

<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>一二　後庭花</p>
<p>他們爲了隔夜的缺少睡眠，和這一天走了許多路，於是一躺下去，直睡到第二天日高三丈才醒過來。是維城先醒，睜眼望了望屋子裏，窗外的陽允，從牆上反映進來，映得一室　明。再看一看黃龍，躺的四仰八义，手和脚都露在被外。他慢慢的回想到昨晚上的情形，恨不得再去訪問陳老太太一下。這時黃龍　醒了，他一醒，可不能像維城一樣安頓，往上一竄，對維城牀上探着頭。笑道：「什麼時候了？」維城道：不早了罷，我可沒有带着錶。」黃龍蹲在牀沿上，兩手作了一個勢，便颼的一聲跳到了維城牀上，維喊道：「你別嚇我。」黃龍道：「我試試瞧，能跳多遠。還好，沒掉到地　。維城哥，你是在打什麼主意，要是回家的話，我們就大家散夥。」維城道：這是什麽話？我在想往上海去。」</p>
<p>黄龍知道他並没有灰心，連肚子餓也不觉得，便在牀上和維城計劃着怎麽進行。黄龍是從来什麽顧慮的，三言兩語説完，開了房門，要客棧裏夥計送洗水臉和點心進来。又向夥計要了紙墨筆硯，維城寫下一封信。這信是給國器國芳兄妹的。約定維城留守在王順興客棧裏，由黄龍做一回速去速來的青島使。那信上是這样説的：「好久没見面，渴想之至。昨天偶然和一個朋友到雙橋鎮，顺便拜訪令祖母，方才知道令先君已然作古。你們兄妹，連報喪發訃都不曾報來發来，我想到你們兄妹簡直是要把我遺忘了。但是又一個消息，是會使得你們兄妹驚駭的：令祖母受了一些意外地感觸，就在昨天晚上病倒了。現在病勢沈重，頗有些朝不保夕的样子。你們的祖母，就像是我的祖母，我眞止不住淌下眼淚来了。我暫時不忍離開雙橋，等候你們立刻回来。知名，即日。」（二四六）</p>
<h3>居禮的求婚書　（下）</h3>
<p>— Lincoln　Schuster著　古心譯</p>
<p>世界著名科學家的書翰之一</p>
<p>如果你會寫信給我，確實吿訴我說，你將於十月裏回來，我就快樂了。如果你照下列的地址直接將信寄到蘇克司（Sceaux）來，就會快些達到我的手裏：蘇克司，撒勃朗路十三號，比耶爾居禮（Pierre　Curie，13　Rae　desSabloes，Sceanx）</p>
<p>後果伊芙，居禮問着說：「寫出這些信來，對於他的盛名不是更能錦上添花麼？」</p>
<p>十月裏馬利回函巴黎的實騐室裏時，比耶爾恢復了他的求愛工作。伊芙。居禮寫着說：「在他的心裏常存着同樣的信心，就是將她作爲未來的妻子，這信心是完全的，純粹的，一毫不攙雜別的念頭的。…他甚至爲了他自己單獨懂得的幸福，犧牲別人所說的幸福。換言之，他提議一種純屬友誼的安排，甚至自己願　和馬利同到波蘭去。他變成了一個卑微的懇求者。…」這樣的求愛，繼續了十個月。</p>
<p>最後，在一八九五年七月裏，馬利寫信給她的一個女友說：</p>
<p>你接到這封信的時候，你的曼雅（Manga）已經改換她的名字了。我現在就要嫁給那個我去年在華沙和你說到的人了。要我留在巴黎，當然我不高興，但是我能做些什麼呢？運命已經你我們彼此深深地關連着，我們再也不敢想離開了。</p>
<p>我預先沒有吿訴你，因爲這事的決定還不允，實在是突然的。我遲疑了整整一年，不能獲得一個答復。最後我才這樣決定了下來。你接到了這封信，寫回信時這樣寫：洛芒路四十二號，物理化學校，居禮夫人（Mme　Currie，School　of　Physics　and　Chemistry，42　Rae　Lhomand）。</p>
<p>在結婚的一天，馬利·斯克洛杜夫斯卡請一個送她嫁衣的朋友給她這樣一件衣服：「實用而暗色的，以便在實騐室中也可以穿著。」他們度蜜月的方法是騎了脚踏車在鄕間遊行，並且徒步在樹林中探訪。他們稱這　爲新婚的流浪」。</p>
<p>馬利和比耶爾·居禮的羅曼史就這樣吿了結束。他們一生的故事會由伊芙·居禮美麗地槪述如下：</p>
<p>她是一個婦女：她屬於一個被壓逼的國家；她貧窮；她美麗。一種有力的召喚，使她離開了祖國波蘭，而往巴黎讀書，她在那裏過了幾年孤苦不堪的生活。在那裏她遇到了一個和她一樣有天才的男子。她嫁了他；他們的幸福是完美的。藉着百折不撓的努力，他們發現了一個魔性的原子，鐳。這種發現不但產生了新科學，並且使人類有方法來醫治一種兇險的疾病。</p>
<p>也許在這裏來複述一下恩期坦（Einstein）著名的讚語是很合適的，他說：「在所有著名的人類中，馬利·居禮是惟一沒有被盛名所害的人。」</p>
<p>一九〇六年，比耶爾·居一禮在街上被一輛貨車碾死，居禮夫人就在沙爾蓬繼續他當敎授，就在他所講授到的一點講授下去。一九二一年，她訪問美國，哈定總統代表美國的婦女贈給她一公分的鐳，這大約值到十二萬美金。一九三四年她逝世，病因是鐳的實騐毀壞了她的健康。（本篇完）</p>

<h3>Shanghai Education Problems</h3>
<p>Shanghai has always been the cultural center of the country, and education is especially developed. From primary schools to universities, the number of schools, the number of students, and all equipment and facilities rank first in the country. Over the decades, it has cultivated countless talents. However, since the Sino-Japanese War, Shanghai's education has also entered a state of great depression, following the stagnation of the entire culture. This new trend has two different meanings:</p>
<p>First, to be honest, Shanghai's education in the past was filled with the implications of the enslavement education implemented by British and American imperialists in the colonies. Although there have been many reform movements in methods, such as experimental education and the Dalton Plan, in terms of the content and purpose of education, the main goal was not to cultivate construction talents for the country, but to train compradors and tools for the colonial interests of British and American imperialists in China! In the past few decades, China has had new education, which must be considered a blessing from "European winds and American rains," but this new education has also brought new shackles. During this period, many talents have been sacrificed. After the Sino-Japanese War, especially after December 8th last year, the power of British and American imperialism in China began to collapse, breaking the shackles of Shanghai's education accumulated over the years. At the same time, due to the war, some schools and teachers have left Shanghai. Schools that were originally distributed in small cities near Shanghai have also avoided to the "isolated island" in recent years due to environmental factors. Thus, in terms of quantity, Shanghai's education is not less than before the war, and may even have increased; however, in terms of quality, there is no doubt that it has greatly declined! In addition, Shanghai's economic situation is different from what it was a few years ago. Every citizen deeply feels the increased burden of life. The impact on education is that most experienced and well-positioned educational workers have to change careers to engage in commerce or engage in other industries part-time, unable to concentrate on the sacred cause of education; and many people who were not originally educational workers use education as a tool for profit, and use various meanings to create or take over schools at all levels. Their purpose is only to profit, and of course they will not care about the sacred mission of "education." This situation cannot but make people feel regretful that they have escaped from the old cage only to fall into new shackles!</p>
<p>This new crisis seems to have begun to attract the attention of the authorities and all parties recently. Therefore, articles discussing Shanghai's education problems often appear in newspapers! We believe that this is a very important issue, and it has too much to do with the future of China. Not only should the authorities conduct serious and practical discussions with experts from all parties with a broad vision and a frank and sincere attitude in order to seek the independent development of Chinese education, but we also hope that the education community in Shanghai will recognize their own responsibilities, recognize their right to speak out, and the possible role they can play, and propose concrete opinions from the long-term perspective of China's future.</p>
<p>As for the solution to Shanghai's education problems at present, as far as our limited knowledge is concerned, we believe that the following points are quite important. First of all, in response to the current widespread instability in the Shanghai education community, we should try to stabilize it, especially large and small schools and specialized schools with history, so that the organizers and faculty can be assured of maintaining the schools, assured of continuing education work, and not think otherwise. At the same time, we must strive to eliminate unstable factors in the education community, such as ensuring the safety of life of faculty members in political aspects, and ensuring the public activities of all legal schools and educational institutions, and in social and public opinion aspects, give the education community more assistance, and show the necessary respect to teachers and educators.</p>
<p>Secondly, during the stabilization period, we must also strive to ensure that students can study seriously, studying things that are conducive to developing students' talents and then serving the community and society. Here, on the one hand, we must compile textbooks and supplementary reading materials in large quantities and with precision. During the transition period, the original textbooks in the market should be reviewed and approved for temporary application to remedy the heartbreaking phenomenon that some schools currently lack textbooks and students learn nothing because of the various random sources they pull from; on the other hand, we must improve the current – actually, the educational system in schools that has been accumulating for many years – and appropriately correct the proportion of each subject, reduce or eliminate unnecessary subjects to reduce the burden on students and allow them to concentrate on the study of major and necessary subjects, so that they will not spend all day learning in a debt-like and indiscriminate way, and in fact know nothing about each subject.</p>
<p>Finally, and also very important, is (1) assisting the lives of faculty members. The hardship of the lives of faculty members at present is something that cannot be imagined by those who are well-fed and warmly clothed! As a result of such hardship, good faculty members are forced to leave their jobs, which lowers the standards of teachers! This is a very serious problem! Recently, enthusiastic people in society have seen this and have taken various charitable actions to subsidize the lives of teachers, but it is still not widespread enough, and the amounts are too small! On the one hand, we hope that the authorities will make a unified plan and determine a certain amount of funds. At the same time, we hope that society will create an atmosphere in which donating funds to subsidize the lives of faculty members is the greatest glory. (2) is to provide relief to poor students. The burden of studying for students now is so heavy that the cost of elementary school is enough for the university in the past, and the cost of middle school is enough for studying abroad a few years ago! However, the income of ordinary parents below the middle class, especially the vast number of salary earners, is very limited! As a result, they have no choice but to let their children drop out of school with heartache! This is a loss for society and the country! This is also what everyone should not ignore! We hope that the authorities and school authorities at all levels will agree to increase the number of free and reduced-fee places. At the same time, leaders from all walks of life in society should strive to promote the movement to provide relief to poor students. If both approaches are taken simultaneously, it may make a significant contribution to Shanghai's education in the future!</p>
<h3>Imperial Headquarters Announces: Results of Air Raid on Chittagong; 29 Enemy Planes Shot Down</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Domei News Agency) – The Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM today that the Japanese Air Force stationed in Burma air-raided Chittagong and Feni airfields in India on December 15th and 16th, shooting down and damaging a total of 29 enemy aircraft on the ground, and inflicting heavy damage on military facilities. Of the 29 aircraft, 15 were shot down in combat, 4 were also believed to have been shot down, but this has not been confirmed, and another 10 were burned and completely destroyed on the ground. One Japanese aircraft crashed into enemy positions, and four are missing.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Army Air Force is quite active in Burma. In the past five and ten days, it has fiercely bombed Chittagong in India, inflicting great damage on British transport convoys, military facilities, and air forces that were reinforcing the port. On the 15th and 16th, it again massively bombed the Chittagong airfield and docks, as well as the Feni airfield, about 90 kilometers northwest of Chittagong, inflicting fatal blows on the British Air Force bases and air forces in eastern India, which were attempting to disrupt Japanese-occupied territories with guerrilla warfare. The air raid on Chittagong on the 15th was divided into two attacks, in the morning and afternoon. The main facilities of the airfield were almost completely destroyed by the fierce bombing of Japanese aircraft. Many bomb hits occurred at the crossroads of the runway in the airfield, and large fires broke out everywhere. On the afternoon of the 16th, Japanese aircraft once again flew over the Arakan Mountains on the Indo-Burmese border, braving the adverse weather conditions near Chittagong, and bombed the Feni airfield at 11:00 AM. At the time, it was raining near Chittagong, and the dense clouds were less than 1,000 meters high. In addition, more than 20 barrage balloons were swaying in the sky, making the air raid quite difficult. However, the Japanese army finally overcame these obstacles and engaged in fierce air combat with enemy aircraft at low altitudes, and carried out low-altitude bombing, achieving the great results announced by the Imperial Headquarters. This time, the initial bombing of Chittagong, followed by the bombing of the airfield and docks in the area, as well as the Feni airfield, was tantamount to delivering a head-on blow to the enemy forces who were reinforcing their troops in eastern India and attempting to counterattack Burma.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to sources in military circles here, the Japanese Army Air Force in China had previously detected that the Chongqing-U.S. Air Force was attempting to bomb peaceful areas of China and the Japanese mainland around December 8th, the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. In order to preemptively strike, they immediately bombed the main airfields of the Chongqing side from the 6th to the 8th of this month, rendering most of them unusable. The Chongqing-U.S. attempt was thus invisibly crushed. It is noted that the Chongqing Air Force and the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing had repeatedly bombed key points and ships in peaceful areas of China since mid-November. By the end of the month, they fled to the rear inland, but around the 4th of this month, they suddenly became active again. The Japanese army was deploying fighter-bomber squadrons to Guilin and other areas, attempting to move, and planning to bomb areas in central and southern China, as well as the Japanese mainland, around the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War on the 8th. The Japanese Army Air Force in China then formed a large formation of fighter-bombers from the 6th to the 8th of this month and continuously and fiercely bombed the main strongholds of the Chongqing-U.S. forces, such as the Guilin, Yushan, Suichuan, Jian'ou, Ganzhou, and Hengzhou airfields, destroying countless airfield facilities and runways on the ground, most of which could not be restored in the short term. The Chongqing-U.S. attempt was thus eliminated, and at the same time, the remaining aircraft also fled to the rear inland. Moreover, their false propaganda that the majority of the Japanese Air Force had been transferred to the South Pacific front, so that the real strength in China was extremely weak, was thus refuted without attack. Now, in summary, the situation of the Japanese Air Force destroying the Chongqing-U.S. Air Force in these three days is as follows: December 6th, (1) A joint formation of Japanese Air Force bombers and fighters attacked Guilin at 0:45 that day, braving fierce anti-aircraft fire and fiercely bombing the airfield runway, rendering it unusable. In addition, several large aircraft parked on the ground were bombed and destroyed. (2) At 11:15 AM on the same day, they also fiercely attacked the Yushan Chongqing airfield, dropping hundreds of bombs, which hit the runway. (3) At 11:20 AM, they air-raided Suichuan, and more than 70 bombs hit the runway. (4) At 3:22 PM, they air-raided the Jian'ou airfield, dropping bombs that all hit the runway. The airfield was rendered unusable. December 7th, (1) At 9:08 AM this morning, they air-raided the Ganzhou airfield, and all the bombs hit the runway, rendering the airfield unusable in the short term. (2) At 1:30 PM, they air-raided the Hengzhou airfield, destroying part of the runway and auxiliary buildings in the airfield, and bombing and destroying two high-altitude machine guns. (3) At 1:30 PM in the afternoon, they air-raided the Jian'ou airfield, destroying a section of the remaining runway. December 8th, (1) At 12:40 PM this day, when the Japanese aircraft arrived at the Guilin airfield, the Chongqing-U.S. forces were still unaware. They fiercely bombed the runway in the airfield and destroyed its anti-aircraft machine gun positions.</p>
<h3>Staff Officer of Japanese Army Air Force Discusses: Current Situation of U.S. Air Force Stationed in Chongqing: It Has Been Crushed by Fierce Bombing by Japanese Air Force; Future Movements Should Still Be Closely Monitored</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to a cable from a certain Japanese military base, a certain staff officer of the Japanese Army Air Force, which crushed the U.S. Air Force base in Chongqing, recently stated that the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing was reorganized from the volunteer team of the Chongqing Air Force, which was constantly trying to do stupid things, and was disbanded and reorganized in July of this year. It is currently commanded by U.S. Major General Chennault and possesses 60 to 80 fighter jets and 25 bombers. To avoid direct combat with our forces, they specialize in guerrilla warfare, so once attacked by our forces, they flee east and west, and have no will to fight. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Britain and the United States repeatedly suffered defeats, so they used the Chongqing side as a base for operations against Japan, attempting to engage in guerrilla warfare against our mainland and peaceful areas, especially delusional about cutting off our transportation and supply lines. However, their propaganda is completely contrary to the facts, and there has been no success to date. On the contrary, their frontline bases, Kunming, Zhanyi, Yushan, Guilin and other airfields have been continuously and fiercely bombed by our air force since December 6th and are now in a state of collapse. However, they continue to reinforce their foolish actions. As of the 10th, their reinforcements of fighters and training aircraft have reached 120 to 130, and their performance is quite excellent. Therefore, our air force must closely monitor the movements of the enemy air force to ensure complete safety.</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Agencies in Beijing to Form Special Committee to Handle Confiscation of Radios</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) – In order to handle the matters related to the use and possession of prohibited radios in Beijing, the Beijing Municipal Government will organize a special committee to accept applications for special permits and conduct strict reviews.

<h3>Second Phase of Rural Purge Extended; Winter Defense Period</h3>
<p>Jiaxing, 18th (Central News Agency) – The winter defense for the second phase of the rural purge in Taihu Lake South and Central has been decided to be held as usual. The joint military-police conference decided on the joint defense patrol method during the winter defense period, and each group established a winter defense office to be solely responsible for the winter defense. It was previously stipulated that the period would be from December 1st of this year to the end of February of the following year. Now, the original plan has been changed to follow the established case of the 30th year of the Republic, and the winter defense period will be extended by one month, from December 1st of this year to the end of March of next year, for a total of four months.</p>
<p>Jiaxing, 18th (Central News Agency) – The work of local autonomy in the second phase of the rural purge area is gradually showing results under the supervision of the Second Department of the Zhejiang Office. It has now been decided to convene an autonomy performance assessment meeting on the 21st to conduct a public assessment of all staff members. It has been instructed to fill out work reports in recent days in order to handle the assessment.</p>
<p>Jiaxing, 18th (Central News Agency) – The Third Department of the Rural Purge Committee's Zhejiang Office convened a meeting of directors and deputy directors of blockade management offices at 10:00 AM on the 17th in the conference room. Department Chief Zhu Benli presided over the meeting. First, Chief Zhu reported the significance of the meeting, and then the directors of each management office reported on the general situation of the work. The Department gave instructions on everything, and proposals were discussed until the meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Jiaxing, 18th (Central News Agency) – Xu Jidun, Director of the Second Department of the Zhejiang Office, believes that the rural purge education is currently being actively promoted. The newly revised plan for free tuition for students and the method of consolidating school property urgently need to be decided. It has been decided to convene an education meeting in the second phase of the rural purge area on the 25th to discuss everything in detail.</p>

<h3>Japanese Ambassadors and Consuls General in China Conference Successfully Concludes Yesterday; The Gap Between the Embassy and the Asia Development Board is Completely Eliminated; The Connection Between Various Agencies in China is Closer</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Ambassador and Consul General Conference in China continued at the embassy at 9:00 AM this morning, conducting various political, economic, and cultural reviews and discussions on implementation strategies. The details of today's proceedings are briefly recorded below. After the morning meeting, they went to the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association to attend a lunch hosted by Foreign Minister Chu. At 1:15 PM, they visited General Commander Hata at the General Headquarters, and the heads of various departments gave speeches, holding a joint briefing with the General Headquarters authorities, orally reporting on local issues and the importance and significance of military officers. In the evening, they went to the International Club to participate in a cordial meeting and dinner hosted by General Commander Hata and Ambassador Shigemitsu. The entire conference was thus successfully concluded.</p>
<p>(Another Report) The Japanese Ambassador and Consul General Conference in China held in Beijing over the 17th and 18th has successfully concluded. This epoch-making conference under the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry and the unification of local agencies is of great significance and worthy of attention. During the two-day conference, the ambassadors and consuls general were in a state of extraordinary tension. The joint meeting between the General Headquarters and the ambassadors and consuls general convened on the afternoon of the 18th also concluded successfully. In summary, the important gains of this conference are roughly as follows: (1) After the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry, the local embassy and the Asia Development Board were merged to implement unification. Through this conference, the gap between the two was completely eliminated, and it is predicted that even greater results will be achieved in the future. (2) In the past, North China, Central China, and South China had political, economic, and cultural differences due to natural conditions. Therefore, this conference, which convened ambassadors and consuls general from all over China, allowed the ambassadors and consuls general to frankly exchange opinions with each other, and to establish mutual understanding. At the same time, their common points were also discovered, thereby implementing a comprehensive policy. This point is even more meaningful. (3) The results of various talks between the General Headquarters and the Navy during the second day's meeting made the military officials' views more consistent. At the same time, in order to adapt to various requirements, the advancement of all new policies under implementation will also have a very great effect. This type of cordial talk with local military officials is a first, and we have high expectations. It is anticipated that the results of this conference will make it easier to solve the China problem in the Greater East Asia War, further strengthen the forces promoting the strengthening of the National Government in the previous period, and achieve a high degree of practical efficiency.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Ambassador to China Shigemitsu issued a statement at his official residence on the afternoon of the 18th regarding the successful conclusion of the All-China Ambassador and Consul General Conference, as follows: The conference on the 17th and 18th has made great progress under the new organization. In the future, the connection between various agencies of the Greater East Asia Ministry in China will be even closer. The Army and Navy authorities also frankly exchanged opinions, and completely passed the process of this conference. The most meaningful aspect is that the opinions of the central authorities of the government have been clearly demonstrated in the instructions of the Greater East Asia Minister and the Foreign Minister. The various agencies of the military, the Greater East Asia Ministry, and the Foreign Ministry have now formed a unified entity to complete various powerful policies. The fundamental policy towards China remains unchanged, and it will be strengthened and promoted more actively. This is what we have long anticipated. The central authorities also specially dispatched senior officials to participate in this conference and personally presided over the convening of ambassadors and consuls general from all over China in one place. This is indeed a major gain in implementing the central policy. Therefore, this conference has enabled the functions of the newly established Greater East Asia Ministry's comprehensive organization to be fully utilized, and there is no doubt that various measures can be strongly promoted under this new organization.</p>
<h3>Japan to Increase Two Transportation Lines to Central China; To be Implemented from January 1st</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – Direct transportation of passengers and luggage between Japan and Central China has previously only been available via the Shanghai and Qingdao routes. Recently, due to the increasing demand for transportation from Japan via Korea, Manchuria, and North China to Central China, as well as to alleviate transportation and passenger congestion, it has been planned to establish two connecting transportation lines, which will be implemented from January 1st. They are: (1) Via the continent: from the Japan Railway Ministry, via the Busan-Okura Route, via the South Manchuria Railway Line, via the North China Transportation Line, via the Central China Railway Line. (2) Via the coastal route: from the Railway Line, via the Busan-Okura Route, via the Korean Railway Line, via the South Manchuria Railway Line, via the Dalian Steamship Coastal Route, via the Central China Railway Line. After the opening of these two new routes, there will be four transportation lines between Japan and Central China.

<h3>US Military's Relationship with Darlan: Soviet Protest to the US; The Darlan Issue Remains Unresolved</h3>
<p>Lisbon, Havas News Agency, 18th - According to a Washington dispatch, the Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Litvinov, yesterday protested to the US government regarding the relationship between the US military authorities in North Africa and Admiral Darlan.

<p>Stockholm, Swedish News Agency, 18th - The dispute over the Darlan affair has not been resolved by Darlan's own statements. The London Daily Mail correspondent in Madrid claims that the British government and Darlan, through the mediation of General Giraud, held talks. As a result, the British government recognized the permanent ruler of French North Africa. Darlan's recent statements were motivated by this. As for the attitude of the de Gaulle faction, it remains quite firm, because 10,000 French citizens of the de Gaulle faction, formerly detained in North Africa by Darlan's order, have not yet been released.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Swedish News Agency, 18th - According to a London dispatch, a British news agency's diplomatic correspondent said that the cooperation between Admiral Darlan and General Giraud would be a fatal blow to the French resistance movement.

<h3>German Forces Continue to Advance Between the Volga and Don Rivers; Soviet Forces Suffer Losses South of Toropez; Smolensk Offensive Stalls</h3>
<p>German Supreme Headquarters, Swedish News Agency, 18th - This afternoon's German war report stated that Soviet forces launched attacks in the Terek, Stalingrad, and Great Don River Bend areas yesterday, but were all repelled by German forces with heavy losses. It is reported that the Soviet forces lost over 20 tanks. German forces broke through the enemy's strong positions on high ground between the Volga and Don Rivers and continue to advance. Fierce fighting on the Don River is still ongoing. The cooperation between the German-Italian forces and the air force is quite smooth. From December 16th to 17th, a total of 101 enemy tanks were destroyed. The enemy's attack in the central sector was dispersed by German aircraft, and 28 enemy tanks were destroyed. The enemy's local attack in the northern sector was also repelled. In Libya, the German-Italian forces are currently advancing according to plan. There is only reconnaissance activity in Tunisia.</p>
<p>Berlin, Swedish News Agency, 18th - According to sources here, the Soviet army launched an offensive against Smolensk two weeks ago, but the offensive has stalled after the Soviet army was encircled and annihilated south of Toropez. The Soviet army lost 542 tanks, 447 artillery pieces, over 1,000 trucks, 15,000 dead, and 4,200 captured. This shows that the Soviet army used this place as the center of its offensive, and the huge number of artillery and tank losses is clear evidence of the Soviet army's grand plans. Berlin military officials believe that the Soviet army's encirclement and annihilation in Toropez is a major victory in the northern sector of the Eastern Front and will affect the future course of the war. The Soviet army continues to attack in various places on the Eastern Front, but without a pre-planned plan.</p>
<p>Berlin, Swedish News Agency, 18th - Responsible sources claim that a part of the Soviet elite forces was encircled and annihilated by the German army southeast of Toropez. This unit had the latest motorized equipment and artillery and originally planned to break through the German front line south of the area between Rzhev and Toropez, but once it broke in, its rear was cut off by the German army and was eventually surrounded and annihilated by the German army. The heavy rain on the Eastern Front has stopped, and the German air force has intensified its activities again. Yesterday, Soviet aircraft losses reached 60, while the German side lost only 7. In the Valdai Hills near Smolensk, Soviet forces also launched attacks, but their strength was very weak. In the central Don River area and the Stalingrad area, the Soviet offensive has intensified, but there has been no progress, only increasing their losses.</p>
<h3>Rome Evacuates Military Institutions; Naples Evacuates Children</h3>
<p>Rome, Swedish News Agency, 18th - A Swedish News Agency reporter learned yesterday from well-informed sources that after Italy joined the war, relevant parties planned to evacuate all government offices in Rome and declare the city a non-defended city. Later, because the enemy also frequently bombed non-defended cities, it was abandoned. However, Italy will continue to abide by legal principles and prepare to evacuate Rome's military institutions.</p>
<p>Rome, Central News Agency, 17th - According to a dispatch from Naples, the local authorities, in order to cope with the indiscriminate bombing by British aircraft, ordered a few days ago to evacuate all children in the city, both male and female, from the age of six to fourteen.

<h3>Hu Zhengzhi Reports on Travels in Gansu and Shaanxi: A Letter; Rural Household Weaving and Sideline Industries Have Collapsed; Maintaining Existing Enterprises is Most Urgent</h3>
<p>Mr. Hu Zhengzhi, general manager of the Chongqing Ta Kung Pao, recently participated in the public funeral of Zhang Jiluan and inspected the Northwest before returning to Chongqing. He issued a letter to a friend reporting on the recent situation in the Northwest. Excerpts of the key points are as follows: "I flew from Chongqing to Lanzhou on August 18th, arriving in three hours. I stayed in Lanzhou for eight days. Since it was my first time, everything I saw and heard was new. On August 26th, I was sent to Xi'an in a small car by Mr. He Jingwu, director of the Northwest Highway Bureau. The journey took three days. The products of Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Mao were abundant, but due to transportation congestion, goods were abandoned on the ground, which is regrettable. I stayed in Xi'an for fourteen days to handle Jiluan's funeral. Although I felt busy and tired, I had the opportunity to contact people from various aspects of Shaanxi, which was also a laborious task. The atmosphere in Shaanxi Province is not as monotonous and open as in Gansu. The customs of the north are deeper, and grassroots politics need to be improved, especially in areas such as police affairs and baojia systems. The atmosphere of depression and confusion among the gentry, merchants, and the public is too strong, and the younger generation is even more bewildered. There are many small organizations of all kinds, and no small amount of legitimate energy is consumed in struggles and friction. Gansu Province does not produce cotton, and the problem of clothing is extremely serious. Poor children often lack complete shirts and pants. I met three or five young poor girls on the highway who were naked from the waist down. There must be more in the villages. I had heard in Gansu that the Northwest relied on Henan homespun for clothing, but recently it has suddenly disappeared. After arriving in Chang'an, I inquired in detail and learned that due to regulations, rural household weaving and sideline industries have collapsed. Looking ahead, I feel that the country is worrying. Industry in Shaanxi Province is more developed than in Gansu. There are still quite a few new-style factories with smoking chimneys in Xianyang and Baoji. However, when I meet with relevant people, they always say that regulations are too strict, transportation is inconvenient, taxes are too heavy, and costs are too high, making it impossible to sustain. They even say that if things continue like this, in another year or two, most of the existing industries will have to close down. What hope is there for new construction? Their suffering and hardship cannot be truly understood by those who are far away and on the outside. Current opinion competes to say that the Northwest should be developed, but in fact, the most urgent problem is how to maintain the Northwest's existing enterprises and organizations. Brother Jiluan, in his dealings with people and affairs, always acted with peace and kindness. His death was also repaid by all parties, public and private, and was truly generous. The scenery of the cemetery is excellent. Shaanxi had been dry for a long time, but on September 4th, there was a sudden heavy rain. The colleagues handling the funeral were worried that the weather might affect the funeral, but the weather was clear on both the 5th and 6th, especially on the 6th. Therefore, no less than 100,000 people participated in the public funeral, and it was extremely sorrowful and honored. The rain resumed the next day, and people all said that Brother Ji had good luck after death."</p>

<h3>To Reduce Potential Encounters: Shanghai Residents Must Be Vigilant; Military Authorities Will Make Every Effort to Eliminate the Possibility of Air Raids; Remarks by the Commissioner General of the Shanghai Municipal Police</h3>
<p>The second air raid control exercise is currently underway. In order to further urge the public to pay attention to this, the Commissioner General of the Shanghai Municipal Police made the following remarks yesterday: "If Shanghai residents want to reduce the risk of Shanghai encountering air raids, they must take all precautionary measures to protect themselves and must make every effort to comply with the instructions issued by the authorities. Recalling 1937, when bombs fell on the concessions and lives and property were lost, this is a historical lesson. The people must prevent it from happening again. The cause of this incident in the past was the complete lack of organization and cooperation between public agencies. This is now a thing of the past, because the people of Shanghai are deeply aware of their responsibilities. I am deeply gratified by the mutual understanding and cooperation between the people and the authorities, and I hope that people from all walks of life will work hard to protect themselves, and that they will study all relevant instructions in order to understand them thoroughly."</p>
<p>Shanghai Is Already in a Wartime Situation</p>
<p>The Commissioner General continued: "I personally went to the Broadway Mansions and the roof of the Wing On Company Building on the night of the air raid drill, and the general situation has greatly improved compared to the last time. In the western Hongkou district, the situation in some places was 'extremely bad.' The results in other areas of the International Settlement were completely satisfactory. During an air raid, the public must be absolutely spontaneous, because Shanghai is already in a wartime situation, so air raids are not impossible, but the military authorities will do everything possible to eliminate this possibility."</p>
<p>Thorough Training in Preventive Measures</p>
<p>It is also learned that the purpose of the last air raid drill was only to control lighting. The current situation is very different. All people in the city must be thoroughly trained to deal with the crisis from above. Therefore, the scope of this training is wider, and the public must comply with the orders of the authorities even more. Taking schools as an example, all primary and secondary school students must be taught how to prevent air raids, and suitable shelters and aid stations must also be established. Attention should also be paid to fire extinguishing, putting out incendiary bombs, and rescue work. Baojia personnel and self-defense corps must be responsible for educating the people. The Commissioner General added that Shanghai lacks the yellow sand needed to extinguish ordinary incendiary bombs, but wet clothes are equally effective.</p>
<p>Reduced Crime Depends on Baojia</p>
<p>It is also reported that 450,000 baojia personnel and 170,000 self-defense corps members have proven to have a huge effect on maintaining order and security in the International Settlement, and they have also provided great help to the police department in the work of air raid drills. In 1941, the International Settlement had an average of 120 robbery cases per month, and some citizens were often subjected to terror. From May 1942 to the present, the number has dropped from 120 per month to once or twice per month. It is said that part of the reason is due to the efforts of the baojia and self-defense corps members. The phenomenon of public non-cooperation in Shanghai in 1941 has now changed. Every resident is now happy to enter into a state of harmony.</p>
<p>Continued Control</p>
<p>It is also learned that air raid control is continuing these days, and the city is still in a state of alert. It is hoped that the public will pay attention to the air raid sirens at all times and take appropriate steps. The work of the baojia personnel in each group is still continuing.</p>
<h3>Private Lighting Must Be Strictly Shielded</h3>
<p>The French Concession authorities issued a notice to residents to pay attention. In the coming days, there will be several more warning alarms, and street lights will remain open as usual. However, during this alert period, the lights in all private residences, shops, private roads, and alleyways must still be strictly shielded. Everyone is expected to comply respectfully.</p>
<h3>Shanghai West Financial Advisory Committee to Be Established Today</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Shanghai Municipal Council signed the Shanghai West Financial Agreement, the finances of the Shanghai West area have been taken over by the Municipal Government. The Municipal Finance Bureau has established a financial office in the area, and all tax revenues in the area are collected by the office. However, in order to seek the opinions of the residents of the area, a financial advisory committee was organized. There are a total of nine members, four of whom are recommended by the Municipal Council and five of whom are selected by the Municipal Government, all of whom are gentry from Shanghai West. The committee's task is to offer the mayor opinions on financial matters and to be consulted by the mayor. The preparatory work of the committee has been completed and it will be established at the Municipal Government at 3:00 PM this afternoon. The list of members is as follows: Feng Bingnan, Ye Fu, Zhu Boquan, Shen Siliang, Li Hongfei, Seiiichi Miyoshi, Toranosuke Morimoto, Shichitaro Yada, Gregory Ksinos, Piexo Caluna, and nine others. The Municipal Government will also invite Director-General Okazaki and Chief of General Affairs Teraoka of the Municipal Council and heads of relevant Chinese and foreign agencies to participate in the establishment of the committee today.</p>
<h3>Soliciting Donations for Clothing for Impoverished Children</h3>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA, in view of the general poor children in Shanghai who are suffering in the streets during the winter season, is very sympathetic. The association has made and distributed winter clothing for poor children over the years, and many have relied on it to survive. This year's city conditions are difficult, even more so than before, and it is expected that there will be more children suffering from the cold than in previous years. Since the launch of fundraising and sewing winter clothing in preparation for distribution, progress has been smooth. Several tens of thousands of dollars have been raised, and warm-hearted people from all walks of life are generously donating. This time, the association has specified a method. Anyone who wants to donate themselves or entrust the association to donate on their behalf is welcome. Mr. Zhao Shiying has been specially assigned to be responsible for this matter. If you have any donations, please send them directly to the YMCA in Baxianqiao. Contact Mr. Zhao for all details.</p>
<h3>Mr. Wen Lanting Recovered and Discharged from Hospital</h3>
<p>Mr. Wen Lanting's illness and hospitalization have been of great concern to the public. Reports on his condition and treatment have been published in various newspapers. Mr. Wen has been hospitalized for over two months. His decade-long ailment has vanished, and his joy is beyond words. The reporter not only congratulates Mr. Wen but also celebrates the future of Shanghai society, as Mr. Wen has been dedicated to public welfare for decades, contributing greatly to society. He has been so busy with public affairs that he neglected his illness. Two months ago, due to overwork, his prostatic hypertrophy gradually worsened, leading to urinary retention. Only then did he seek medical treatment. During his hospitalization, all his public welfare affairs were inevitably affected. Now, he has regained his health from ten years ago and was discharged from the hospital yesterday. Currently, social affairs are awaiting Mr. Wen's continued handling with his spirit of being old but vigorous. The details of Mr. Wen's illness and treatment are recorded below, which will be welcomed by those who are concerned.</p>
<p>Condition of Illness</p>
<p>Mr. Wen suffered from senile prostatic hypertrophy for nearly ten years. Ten years ago, he urinated once every night, five years ago two or three times every night, and in the past two years, it increased to five or six times every night. The number of times during the day also increased, with small amounts of urine each time. Recently, urination gradually became difficult, and even impossible. Prostatic hypertrophy is called "strangury" in traditional Chinese medicine, which is generally caused by decreased testicular secretion in the elderly, leading to gradual enlargement of the prostate, causing the urethra and bladder opening to be squeezed, making urination difficult. Mild cases result in weak urination and incomplete emptying, while severe cases result in unsmooth urination, eventually leading to obstruction. If appropriate treatment is not administered, it can be life-threatening. Mr. Wen is seventy-three years old, and in recent years, he has been handling social affairs with unusual intensity, which is closely related to the development of this disease.</p>
<p>Treatment Process</p>
<p>Mr. Wen is the chairman of Shanghai Nanyang Hospital. Since he was unable to urinate and felt severe pain, he went to the hospital for diagnosis and treatment on October 8. He was treated by Dr. Chen Bangdian, the director of the Department of Urology, who immediately performed urinary catheterization. After draining the urine, Mr. Wen was discharged from the hospital to prepare everything. The next day, he was hospitalized for radical treatment. Initially, a catheter was inserted into the urethra to facilitate excretion, and more than ten injections of testicular secretion preparations were administered successively. At the same time, traditional Chinese medicine was tried, but both proved ineffective. After careful discussion by the doctors, it was determined that the treatment of this disease would not be successful without surgery. Therefore, on the morning of October 16, Dr. Chen performed vasoligation under local anesthesia to prevent epididymitis during treatment. After removing the catheter once, a urination test was performed, but it was ineffective. Mr. Wen resolutely decided to follow the advice of the doctors and undergo thorough treatment. Thus, on the morning of the 25th, Dr. Chen Bangdian presided over the prostatectomy with the assistance of Drs. Gao Rimei and Wang Yijing, using spinal anesthesia. After one hour of surgery, 300 cc of blood were transfused, and the recovery was good. On the third and fourth days, there was a slight fever, with the highest temperature being 37.9 degrees Celsius, which soon subsided. Although there was some discomfort afterward, with the careful care of the doctors and nurses, he quickly recovered. The abdominal wound gradually healed. By November 20, he was able to urinate spontaneously through the urethra, and the amount of urine gradually increased, and the time interval gradually lengthened. On December 8, he was able to get out of bed, and on the 11th, he was able to take a walk. On the 18th, he walked out of the hospital.</p>
<p>It is reported that Mr. Wen was very happy in the few days before his recovery. He expressed his deep gratitude to the doctors, nurses, and staff of the hospital. When he was discharged from the hospital, he smiled and said, "I walked into the hospital two months ago. After many surgeries, I am fortunate to have recovered. Today, I can walk out of the hospital, and the smoothness of urination is unprecedented in the past ten years. It is truly unexpected and makes people endlessly happy!" Mr. Wen has extensive social connections. During his hospitalization, hundreds of people visited him every day. Now that he has recovered and been discharged from the hospital, everyone is celebrating. Some say that Mr. Wen is blessed by heaven and has done good deeds throughout his life. Heaven's reward for good people is evident.</p>

<p>A practical and effective way to eliminate illegal profits is to use the Baojia system to establish consumer cooperatives. The function of cooperatives is to ensure that essential living materials reach the hands of real consumers under the most economical conditions. Now, if the Baojia system can be used to manage it, its ideal and perfect effectiveness can be further realized. For example, if food problems occur now, this Baojia cooperative can apply to the relevant authorities for a purchase certificate based on the number of people in the district and the amount of shortage, and directly purchase it from the low-priced production area and distribute it according to the population. Before the authorities increase the per capita rice ration, they will surely show sympathy and provide convenience for the Baojia cooperative to purchase the necessary food.</p>
<p>The organizational outline of the Baojia cooperative is briefly outlined as follows: (1) Naming: Shanghai 〇〇 District Baojia Consumer Cooperative General Office or Shanghai 〇〇 District 〇 Union 〇 Bao Consumer Cooperative; (2) Organization: 1. The General Office is composed of district committee members and union Bao chiefs as ex-officio directors, responsible for purchasing daily necessities for households in the district from production areas or producers and distributing them to each cooperative; 2. The branch is based on one Bao as a unit, and the chief and deputy Baojia chiefs are the ex-officio directors of the branch, responsible for purchasing daily necessities for households in the Bao from the General Office and distributing them to households. The quantity is calculated based on the average population; (3) Business: 1. Each consumer must subscribe to 10 yuan of shares as capital for purchasing goods. If the amount is insufficient, the directors are responsible for finding ways to borrow. Consumers take households as a unit and can purchase the goods that should be distributed in the period from the cooperative with cash within a certain period. 2. Branches also trade in cash when purchasing goods from the General Office. 3. The General Office wholesales goods according to the purchase cost plus a hypothetical profit of 10%. The branch sells goods according to the wholesale price plus 20%. 4. The directors and staff in the cooperative are all voluntary positions. 5. The funds of hypothetical profits, except for the compensation of loan interest and the loss of goods, are distributed proportionally according to the consumption amount of the consumer households within a certain period.</p>
<p>The characteristics of the cooperative are that, first, the required items are purchased directly from the production area or producers, which can eliminate the layers of exploitation by middlemen; second, cash transactions can eliminate the risks of operators; third, the amount of profit is distributed to consumers according to the amount of consumption. In this way, no penny of the money spent by consumers is wasted meaninglessly. Now, the cooperative is run by the Baojia organization, and all items are distributed equally according to the population, which can avoid the phenomenon of uneven wealth, and it does not hinder the authorities' per capita ration system.</p>
<p>(II) Leisurely</p>
<p>The Shanghai rice problem should be resolved as soon as possible. I thought of a way, please discuss it.</p>
<p>(1) All trade associations in Shanghai jointly organize a grain purchasing group and request the authorities to approve it as an auxiliary household ration rice agency.</p>
<p>(2) The capital for this grain purchase is guaranteed by various trade associations, and borrowed from various banks at extremely low interest rates.</p>
<p>(3) This auxiliary household rice does not need to set up another agency for sale. It can be sold by the rice shops that sell household rice, and each ticket is allowed to purchase six catties of auxiliary rice (that is, six days of rice per person) or three and a half liters.</p>
<p>(4) If the purchase of rice is less than the above quantity (that is, six catties per ticket) due to special circumstances, flour and major grains can be allocated in moderation.</p>
<p>In short, rationing grain according to the population is originally to prevent hoarding, not to make citizens starve. Now the household rice once every ten days is only four days of food. Citizens get up and think of ways to provide relief. I think the wise and compassionate authorities cannot but allow it.</p>

<h3>Supplementary Explanation of Radio Crackdown Measures</h3>
<p>Regarding the crackdown measures on wireless radio receivers in the Shanghai area, the authorities have issued detailed announcements. Recently, the Japanese Embassy authorities have added supplementary explanations regarding the implementation details: (1) The declaration places for the first item of the authorities' talk about radio receivers with more than seven tubes are as follows: (A) Japanese (natural persons and legal persons) are the police stations of the consulates general under their jurisdiction; (B) Those who reside in the French Concession other than Japanese (if it is a legal person, it refers to the location of its main office in the French Concession) are the Yokohama Specie Bank at No. 733 Juelaida Road; (C) Others are the Broadcasting Non-Terminal Radio Supervision Office at No. 316 Hartung Building, Nanjing Road; (2) Those who wish to obtain special permission for the banned radio receivers in the fourth item of the talk should apply at the following places: (A) Japanese (natural persons and legal persons) are the police stations of the consulates general under their jurisdiction (B) Those who reside in the Public Concession other than Japanese (if it is a legal person, it refers to the location of its main office in the Public Concession, the same applies below) are the Special High Fourth Section of the Police Headquarters of the Public Works Bureau (Inner); Those who reside in the French Concession are the Police Headquarters of the French Municipal Council; (D) Those who reside in the area under the jurisdiction of the Special Municipal Government are the Police Bureau under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Government; (3) Those who are allowed to hold and use banned radio receivers are limited to those who are necessary for official business. Therefore, it is a principle not to grant permission to individuals. It is hoped that general users will not file application forms to increase the authorities' procedures. It is better to quickly report or modify them. The calculation method of management: (A) The number of vacuum tubes does not only refer to those made of glass, but also includes metal tubes. If ordinary people do not understand this very well, they can go to a specialist modification shop or declaration office to inquire; (B) However, electric sleep, that is, blue, eyeball-shaped lamps, should be removed from the number of vacuum tubes; (C) Radio receivers with more than seven lamps, whether short-wave or medium-wave, must be declared, and attention should be paid to this point; (5) When declaring a banned radio receiver or reporting modification, it is not necessary to bring the machine. However, during the modification process, if it is possible to temporarily stop listening within a certain period, you can contact the designated modification shop and also store the machine in the modification shop. At this time, the modification shop should issue a machine storage certificate; (6) Those who hold banned radio receivers should temporarily keep them as before if they have completed the declaration or reporting modification procedures but have not yet reached the date of purchase or modification. During this period, although they can listen as before, they should understand the purpose of the crackdown and not listen to short-wave broadcasts; (7) If it is difficult to convert short-wave-only radio receivers into medium-wave, the radio station will purchase them. Therefore, the machine should be taken to the designated modification shop or declaration office for contact; (8) All owners of banned radio receivers and ordinary radio receivers (medium-wave radio receivers with six or fewer lamps) who have not yet completed the registration procedures, or who have recently purchased them and have not yet registered, should quickly register in accordance with the second item above;</p>
<p>Mayor Chen's Remarks</p>

<h3>Oil and Sugar Allocation: Not Worrying About Scarcity But Unevenness</h3>
<p>Oil and sugar allocation will soon adopt a system of purchasing with house tax tickets. Before a per capita distribution can be implemented, this seems to be a temporary measure for sales, awaiting a better solution. However, it is feared that only a few landlords will be able to distribute sugar to subtenants with house tax tickets. Although the majority of Chinese people may not feel great difficulty without sugar in their lives, if oil is also purchased with house tax tickets, and landlords still monopolize it as a privilege, the feeling of unfairness, though suppressed, will permeate people's hearts.</p>
<p>Moreover, according to readers' reports, some people are even reselling sugar purchased with house tax tickets at high prices on the black market to those in need, instead of distributing it to subtenants. Even if they don't distribute it to subtenants, one can report to the sugar allocation office. However, firstly, subtenants living in the same room do not want to offend the landlords too much, to avoid future disputes. Secondly, there are also many subtenants who ask the landlords for sugar, leading to scolding and fighting. Thirdly, the sugar allocation office is not comparable to the announcements of the Public Works Department police station. Because of these three reasons, landlords know that subtenants can do nothing about it and choose not to distribute.</p>
<p>Landlords think that they paid for the sugar, obtained it, and then distributed it to subtenants, which is too much of an obligation. They do not consider that subtenants are not getting the sugar for free, but are still paying a fair price. If landlords find it difficult to obtain sugar and dislike advancing money, it is also possible for subtenants to take turns buying it and distributing it fairly. In this way, rights and obligations are equal, and there is nothing to say. If oil is also purchased with house tax tickets, landlords will find it even more difficult to distribute it to subtenants. If they don't distribute it, can they monopolize it like sugar? It seems unreasonable in terms of human relations, and it is not the original intention of the authorities' allocation.</p>
<p>However, oil and sugar retailers favor the more ambiguous the allocation, the better. The best way is to issue a temporary purchase certificate for oil and sugar allocation, based on households. The term "household" refers to both primary and secondary households. If it refers only to primary households, how is it different from purchasing with house tax tickets? The quantity allocated to each household should be determined by the number of people. Some say that this will take time to calculate. Indeed, but for the sake of fair allocation, it is necessary.</p>
<p>However, when the supply is not sufficient and at the beginning of implementation, it may be helpful to make some adjustments. Divide the population of each household into several levels, with three people as a unit, and allocate a certain amount to each unit. The Public Works Department should periodically determine the allocation amount for primary and secondary households based on the supply and demand. Calculate based on the registered population, divide oil and sugar into two certificates. To save printing costs, each paper should divide the months into several grids, and each purchase should cross out one grid. One paper can be used for several months. In this way, although the quantity is small, the allocation is universal and fair, and people's hearts will be at peace. "Not worrying about scarcity but unevenness," is something that those who talk about allocation must pay attention to. If the house tax ticket method is followed, only landlords and retailers will benefit, and the malpractices must be prevented.</p>

<h3>### Rainproof Cloth Production and Sales Flourishing</h3>
<p>Rainproof cloth sales are consistently strong because rainwear material is no longer available and there are no other new products. It is suitable for raincoats and all-weather coats such as Hai Liesi, Homus Fourth, and Varda. In general, Western clothing stores and raincoat workshops currently have strong buying interest because customers continue to need raincoats and all-weather coats. Factory production is also very brisk. Two types, Yousheng Golden Bear Old Brand and Dawu rainproof serge, are both in demand by buyers.</p>
<h3>### Coarse Grains Actual Sales Not Smooth</h3>
<p>Yesterday, actual sales of coarse grains were moving but not smooth, and the market situation was slightly peaceful. Bean cake fell slightly under the selling pressure from retail investors. Beans were still firm. According to statistics, 500 pieces of Changji bean cake were priced at 83 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen. Four truckloads of Feizi bean cake were priced at 86 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen to 85 yuan.

<h3>### Domestic Cigarettes Weak</h3>
<p>After the price limit on Japanese cigarettes, the cigarette market has been sluggish. British and American goods remain stable, but trading is quite limited. Domestic cigarettes are affected by the weakness of Japanese cigarettes, and prices are also showing weakness. The opening price for Da Ying brand was 9,200 yuan, Lao Dao 8,300 yuan, Pinhai 8,100 yuan, Xiannv 7,700 yuan, and Wuhua 6,100 yuan. Japanese cigarettes, Golden Gun brand 2,650 yuan, Golden Building 3,200 yuan, Red Rose 1,500 yuan, Quanlu 2,750 yuan, 20-stick 2,700 yuan, and Zhizhen 2,200 yuan. Domestic cigarettes, Golden Pyramid 6,400 yuan, Meili 5,750 yuan, Golden Mouse 2,800 yuan, and White Gold Dragon 3,900 yuan, are all showing weakness.</p>
<h3>### New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory Increases Capital</h3>
<p>New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory was founded by Xu Guanqun and Zhao Rutiao 17 years ago. Although it has increased capital several times in the middle, its business has been increasing daily, and there is still a need to increase capital. It is reported that the capital will be increased to 30 million Central Reserve Bank notes, and 6 million yuan of the increased capital of 26 million yuan will be issued at a premium. The purpose of this capital increase is to enable those who are interested in investing in stable industries to have the opportunity to participate in the subscription of shares, which not only shows the openness of the business, but also enables general speculative funds to be incorporated into the right track of legitimate investment.</p>
<p>In order to show the openness of its finances, the factory has specially entrusted experts to review and estimate the balance sheet and the actual situation of the property, and it has been audited and certified by Wang Haifan, an accountant. The originals and copies are stored in various banks and companies that subscribe for premium stocks for subscribers to consult at any time. It is reported that the factory's balance sheet is still calculated at the book value at the end of October 31, while the market value is estimated at more than 92 million yuan. If the actual cash received from this capital increase is about 30 million yuan, the total value of its assets is more than 120 million yuan.</p>
<p>The total amount of capital after the factory's capital increase is 30 million yuan, divided into 3 million shares, each with a face value of 10 yuan, and its total asset value is more than 120 million yuan. If the total asset value of more than 120 million yuan is allocated according to 3 million shares, it is predicted that the value of each new share of the factory should be more than 40 yuan. From this perspective, the issue price of 27 yuan 5 jiao per share, including the premium of 17 yuan 5 jiao per share, is still much lower than the actual value. Therefore, the premium shares of New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory are stocks that are worthwhile for investors to subscribe to.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes of Jin Shengtan</h3>
<p>— Shi</p>
<p>Named Himself After Confucius: Jin Shengtan, a literary critic of the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, was a humorous and eccentric talent. It is said that he once wrote "A Sacrificial Essay for the Underlings" to ridicule the students of Suzhou, saying, "It's getting late, the sacrifice is over. Suddenly, I heard a noisy quarrel under the west corridor, fighting for the fatted meat, you thin and me fat, fighting for the buns, you big and me small. Yan Hui, a man of virtue and action, smiled slightly when he saw it. Zilu, a good man, was anxious when he saw it. Confucius sighed and said, 'I was also without food in Chen, how many times have I seen starving people.'" He took this meaning and named himself Shengtan, probably to mourn the mediocre scholars.</p>
<p>Did Not Love Money: Shengtan was poor when he was young. Many relatives and friends died, but he hated misers the most in his life. Liao Yan's "Biography of Learning from Shengtan" records that he did not love money, saying, "He had the best relationship with Wang Duanshan. Duanshan was a chivalrous person. One day, he gave Mr. Jin 3,000 gold and said, 'I will use this to generate interest. After I die, it will still belong to me. The interest will help you to study.' Mr. Jin agreed. In less than a month, he had squandered it all. So he said to Duanshan, 'Keeping this thing in your house will only increase your reputation as a miser. I have already discarded it for you!' Duanshan laughed and did not take it seriously!" From this, we can see Shengtan's contempt for money. When he commented on "Water Margin," he said about the love of money, "The reason why people need money is that money can make people look good. People take money as their life, and when they have money, they give it to others. If they want to look good, they don't care about money. But there are people who are addicted to hoarding money and don't want to look good. This is one kind of person."</p>
<p>"Records of the Grand Historian" Is Just an Account Book for Wine and Meat: Shengtan was an eccentric talent. He praised the burning of books by the First Emperor in his discussion of history. In his comments in "Water Margin," he said, "...To destroy the Way and to govern is to make arbitrary judgments. If there are arbitrary judgments, how can the books not be burned? If there are people who make arbitrary judgments, how can they not be punished! Therefore, Qin people burned books, not only because of the will of the First Emperor, but also because of the will of Confucius. It was just that Confucius did not burn books because he had no merit in writing books and no right to burn books. If the First Emperor burned books and also burned the scriptures, then although he had the right, he had no virtue. If he had no reason, then he would burn them all without knowing the reason. Therefore, burning the scriptures is the sin of the First Emperor. Burning the books is the merit of the First Emperor." In his writing, he praised Shi Nai'an, the author of "Water Margin," and regarded him as the only talented scholar in three thousand years. As for Sima Qian's historical language, he regarded it only as an account book for wine and meat, not worthy of being called a peerless masterpiece. As for Han Changli's writings, they were just printed texts, not worth mentioning. He despised Han Yu to the extreme. On the contrary, he praised Shi Nai'an to the extreme.</p>
<p>Beheading Is a Joyful Thing: Shengtan relied on his talent and arrogance and was executed for the temple-crying incident. At the time of his execution, he dictated a couplet to his son: "The lotus seeds are bitter in the heart, and the pears are sour in the belly." "Lotus" is homophonous with "pity," and "pear" is close to "unicorn" in the Wu dialect. He was using things to express the bitterness in his chest. Even so, he sighed at the time of his execution: "Beheading is the most joyful thing. I didn't expect to get it unintentionally!" He can be considered to be able to make a calm statement. Now, after reading the letter he sent to his wife on the day he was abandoned in the market, "Give the letter to the eldest son to see. Eating salt vegetables and soybeans together has the taste of walnuts. If this method is passed on, I will have no regrets." We can know that he was more magnanimous than Ji Kang, who sighed when he made "Guangling San" before his execution.</p>
<p>Refuted Being Lustful but Not Lecherous: In the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, the eight-legged essay was popular, and Shengtan was always a "traitor." Although he also read the "Book of Songs" and Mencius, he was not satisfied with the words of the schoolteacher. For example, the predecessors said that "Guofeng" was lustful but not lecherous, but he believed that "lechery is lust." He said in the general comment of "The Story of the Western Wing": "Remember, stranger! How far is lust from lechery? If you think that it is based on feelings and stops at propriety, it is called lust, and stopping at propriety is called not lecherous, if it is so, then when I first received the "Book of Songs" at the age of ten, the schoolteacher had already explained it. How could I have not heard of it? How could I have forgotten it after hearing it? I cannot understand lust. How must it be, to be called "good sex"? How must it be, to be called "lechery"? How must it be, to be called "almost lechery"? How must it be, to be called "almost lechery"? How must it be, to have light propriety, so as not to be lecherous? How must it be to have light propriety, so that it can not be lecherous and not hinder its lust? If you say that you are lustful but not lecherous, then you must not be lustful. If you say that you are afraid of propriety and dare not be lecherous, then you must not even dare to be lustful." Although his understanding is a strange theory, it actually opened the prelude to modern poetry with love. In "The Story of the Western Wing," he rebuked the Confucian gentlemen who only saw filth and did not see literature everywhere. Reading it today, it is even more enjoyable. It is a pity that his era was different. Although he recognized that the lechery of "Water Margin" was the lust of "Guofeng," and the killing of "Water Margin" was the usurpation of "Spring and Autumn," he was just expressing his own reasons and explaining them on his own. It was inevitable that he would shock the world.</p>

<h3>Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>Two Four Six - Backyard Flowers</p>
<p>They had not slept well the night before, and had walked many roads that day, so they went straight to sleep until the sun was three poles high the next day. Wei Cheng woke up first, opened his eyes and looked around the room. The sunlight from outside the window was reflected on the wall, illuminating the room brightly. He looked at Huang Long again, lying sprawled out with his hands and feet exposed outside the quilt. He slowly recalled the situation last night and wished he could visit Old Mrs. Chen again. At this time, Huang Long also woke up, but he couldn't settle down like Wei Cheng. He sprang up and leaned his head on Wei Cheng's bed, laughing: "What time is it?" Wei Cheng said: "It's not early, I don't have a watch." Huang Long squatted on the edge of the bed, made a gesture with both hands, and jumped onto Wei Cheng's bed with a whoosh. Wei shouted: "Don't scare me." Huang Long said: "I'm just trying to see how far I can jump. It's good, I didn't fall to the ground. Wei Cheng, what are you planning? If you want to go home, let's all break up." Wei Cheng said: "What are you talking about? I'm thinking of going to Shanghai."</p>
<p>Huang Long knew that he was not discouraged, and even forgot that he was hungry, so he planned with Wei Cheng on the bed how to proceed. Huang Long never had any concerns. After a few words, he opened the door and asked the innkeeper to bring in washing water and snacks. He also asked the innkeeper for paper, ink, brush and inkstone. Wei Cheng wrote a letter. This letter was for Guo Qi and Guo Fang, the brother and sister. Wei Cheng was to stay in the Wang Shunxing Inn, and Huang Long would make a quick trip to Qingdao. The letter said: "It's been a long time since we met, I miss you very much. Yesterday, I happened to go to Shuangqiao Town with a friend and visited your grandmother. Only then did I learn that your late father had passed away. You brothers and sisters did not even send a mourning announcement to me, I thought you were simply going to forget me. But another news will shock you brothers and sisters: Your grandmother suffered some unexpected feelings and fell ill last night. Now the disease is serious, and it seems that she may not live long. Your grandmother is like my grandmother, and I can't stop shedding tears. I am temporarily unwilling to leave Shuangqiao and am waiting for you to return immediately. With best wishes, today."

<h3>Curie's Marriage Proposal (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— By Lincoln Schuster, Translated by Gu Xin</p>
<p>One of the Letters of the World's Famous Scientists</p>
<p>I would be happy if you would write to me and confirm that you will be back in October. If you send the letter directly to Sceaux at the following address, it will reach me faster: 13 Rue des Sabloes, Sceaux, Pierre Curie.</p>
<p>Later, Eve Curie asked: "Wouldn't writing these letters add to his fame?"</p>
<p>When Marie returned to the laboratory in Paris in October, Pierre resumed his courtship. Eve Curie wrote: "The same confidence was always in his heart, that she would be his future wife. This confidence was complete, pure, and unmixed with any other thoughts. ... He even sacrificed what others called happiness for his own happiness. In other words, he proposed an arrangement that was purely friendship, and even expressed his willingness to go to Poland with Marie. He became a humble supplicant..." This courtship continued for ten months.</p>
<p>Finally, in July 1895, Marie wrote to a friend:</p>
<p>By the time you receive this letter, your Manya will have changed her name. I am going to marry the man I told you about in Warsaw last year. Of course, I am not happy to stay in Paris, but what can I do? Fate has bound us together deeply, and we dare not think of leaving.</p>
<p>I did not tell you in advance because the decision was not allowed. It was really sudden. I hesitated for a whole year and could not get an answer. Finally, I decided. When you receive this letter, write back to: 42 Rae Lhomand, School of Physics and Chemistry, Mme Currie.</p>
<p>On the day of the wedding, Marie Sklodowska asked a friend who was sending her a wedding dress to give her such a dress: "Practical and dark-colored, so that it can also be worn in the laboratory." Their method of honeymooning was to ride bicycles in the countryside and walk in the woods. They called this "the honeymoon wandering."</p>
<p>The romance between Marie and Pierre Curie ended like this. Their life story would be beautifully summarized by Eve Curie as follows:</p>
<p>She was a woman: she belonged to an oppressed country; she was poor; she was beautiful. A powerful calling made her leave her homeland of Poland and go to Paris to study, where she lived a few years of lonely life. There she met a man of genius like her. She married him; their happiness was perfect. Through unremitting efforts, they discovered a magical atom, radium. This discovery not only produced new science, but also provided mankind with a way to treat a dangerous disease.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is appropriate to repeat Einstein's famous praise here, he said: "Among all famous people, Marie Curie is the only one who has not been harmed by fame."</p>
<p>In 1906, Pierre Curie was crushed to death by a truck on the street, and Madame Curie continued to be a professor in Charpon, teaching where he had taught. In 1921, she visited the United States, and President Harding presented her with a gram of radium on behalf of the women of the United States, which was worth about 120,000 US dollars. She died in 1934, and the cause of the disease was that the radium experiments destroyed her health. (End of this article)</p>
