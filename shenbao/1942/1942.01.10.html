<p>— 林峰</p>
<p>前天晚上，我約了兩個朋友在家裏吃便飯，兩個朋友中，一個楚銀仃裏的小職員，一個是南京路某大百貨公司的賣貨員，大家碰頭的時候，都不約而同的把談鋒集中到上海金融工商業近况上面，首先是小張談起他們公司裏的情形，他說：</p>
<p>「自從去年上二月八日以來，公司營業眞可說是一落千丈，從前營業總額平均每日約有二十萬，現在　祇有六萬到八萬之間，打了一個三折和四折，照以往事實講，國歷的歲尾年頭眞楚生　的黃金時代，譬如前年聖誕節前夜，營業達到六十萬，去年聖誕節物價漲了，而營業祇有七萬，眞是令人咋舌。公司當局規定，除了繁銷貨品如麵包餅乾之類外，</p>
<p>律停十進貨，這樣的下去，其前途實不堪設想……同事方而都恐憂職業的動搖，大有悼惶不可終日之概。」</p>
<p>阿李接下去說：　照我個人眼　看來，像這樣根深蒂固的百貨公司，暫時總還禁得起風吹雨打的，倒是像我們這般小銀行，平日專靠金子紗花投機，漫無月標的押款生意：像高利貸一樣的信用放款，好，現在投機市塲軋坍了，押款貨物因爲沒有　銷，不知道何年何月可以結淸，工商業這樣動盪，信用放款，而且也沒有多餘頭寸，最糟糕的是　支的戶頭不來歸進，有存的戶頭不斷地支出去，這樣看起來，農歷年底的結算報告不知怎樣做法！」聽了他們的話後，因爲自已楚在工廠裏　事的，就談了一些工廠裏的情形：</p>
<p>「我說，實際上首當其衝的還是—廠，現在都聽到許多工鴻解散了，還沒有聽到許多商店銀行停業，這因爲工廠楚靠出品銷出去，換了錢來作製造費用，現在的情形是出品沒有銷路，而每天的製造費用却不能不填—這筆費用比商店銀行的日常開支要大得多—填不起頭寸的就祇好宣告解散。」</p>
<p>「上海的人口分散，市民購賣力降低，大公司，工廠，銀行就慢慢地失去存在的空間，上海的市面就進人了漫漫的長夜裏。」</p>
<p>這楚大家一致的結論。</p>

<p>本來，在陳雲裳從香港返滬之後，就　備中演卜萬蒼導演的時裝片「私戀」和古裝片「王昭君」，然而這兩張片子，躭擱「有一個多月，始終沒有動工，直到前天消息傳來，卜童蒼却父決定放棄這兩個個本而改用顧仲彝編劇的「重見　明」。劇本的內容是叙述一個貧女變目受激失明，最後却又受激興奮而復明的悲慘故事，除由陳雲裳主演外，並決定了顧也魯陳娟娟襲秋霞等人合作，不日就可正式開拍了。</p>
<p>一摩登地獄問世，韓蘭根的　片恭喜發財原定新年在國聯上映，但是當時爲趕攝楊小仲導演的「上海淘余記」，就這樣拖延了下來。不料最近正着手動工的時候，張善現突然令知劇務科，凡新片除特別許可者外，劇本已經通過而尚未拍攝的一律停上。韓蘭根目己是劇務科長，以身作則，他便第一個通告放棄拍攝一恭喜發財一的計劃，同時連陳娟娟主演的情竇初開」，也同樣遭難而告流產！</p>
<p>最近傳說金星可能復活的消息，筆者特走訪該公司關係人，據告他們是暫時將悴頓下　了因爲金　原先是大同攝影塲拍片　，合同期滿，即遷入美成廠上作，但「桃花湖一完成後。合同中告期滿，而一時又沒有攝影塲可借。至於自己的新廠，至少在二月底邊可以完成，所以要復活的話，就得在那個時候。同時聯星公司的弱女作「碧血千秋一、當時因爲女主角英茵　着爲辣斐演「北京人」而遲遲未攝，等到佈景搭好預備開拍的時候，一二·八的砲聲響了起來，在物力的種種困難下，目前也跟着　星夕後，暫時的關起大門來了。</p>

<p>但湘綺倒並不願意把少華當乾兒子，她想把他當做另外一種　親　的小輩……少華是僅僅比梅寶大一歲啊！</p>
<p>「假使我能够把梅寶找回來的話，這裏一家的人有誰會不愛她啊？也許哥哥和嫂嫂在第一天上就要提出他們的要求來了，那時…—　一種中年婦人　常有的幻想，不時在湘綺的腦海裏浮沉着，然而可憐的是她自己還始終不知道梅寶在何處咧！</p>
<p>因爲梅寶沒有着落，她那一個幻想的發展便在無　如何的狀態下完全停　了，只是她對於少　的一切，却依舊非　關心；雖然大學裏的功課巳不是她所能指導的了，但逢到少華在家的時候，她總得跟他有一搭，沒搭的講論學校裏的事。而少華也因自己的父母太過市儈氣，全不懂得學問是什麼一回事的緣故，覺得一到家裏，就祇有她姑母一個人還可以談談，因此不僅湘綺所詢問的一切，他總肯從實回答，便是湘綺所沒有問到的事，他也往往自動的會告訴她。例如他跟那一個同學最知己，卜禮拜天在那一家影戲院裏看戲等等，都會一古腦兒的說出來，絕對不像在父母跟前那樣的隱　。</p>
<p>湘綺瞧他的性格太爽直，太毛燥，有時候也順勢利導的勸告幾句，但說得總是很溫婉，使少華聽了，倒比受他老子拍檯拍凳的大駡更願　接受。</p>

<p>— 澤夫</p>
<p>越劇舊稱紹興文戲，原名的篤戲，或曰小歌戲。的篤者，以此戲演唱時，僅鼓板按拍，馨如的篤而已。其戲產生於紹興之嵊縣，初係　種歌曲，每三四句或五六句必一頓，頓後則以啊呵吟啊吟啊等音爲尾聲。民國二年，嵊西童家村有王桂老，童大砲者，始將所歌各曲，編排戲劇，登臺演唱。所演若「琵琶記」，金瓶梅一，「　笑姻緣」等，皆淫情浪態，過於花豉戲，故極爲般人士所歡迎。洎至民國—一年間，滬上各游藝塲亦有此戲之表演，同時樂器行頭，均加改良，不若前時之因吶就簡。其後主事者以男演員不足號召，乃訓練十五六歲之女演員，使之來滬串演，目編排新劇，增置佈景，於是　會人士，交相稱譽，昔之寄跡游藝塲所默默無聞者，今多　組班底開院演唱矣。値此滬上地方據（如蘇灘甬灘　）日趨衰洛夕際，　此戲反較前爲發展，誠可謂得犬獨厚，劇界之驕子矣。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Singapore Issues Communiqué: British Troops Retreat in Malaya, Fierce Battles Between Perak and Selangor, Japanese Troops Continue to Advance Towards Kuala Lumpur <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Singapore, 9th (Havas) – Official sources here have just released a communiqué stating that British troops have retreated to the south of the Slim River in Lower Perak.</p>
<p>Singapore, 8th (Havas Agency) – The British General Headquarters has just issued a war report stating that after Japanese infantry broke through the British lines in Malaya, there has been a continuous movement. British troops in the Slim River area of Lower Perak Province are retreating southwards, suffering slight losses. British troops in the Selangor area launched a counter-attack to relieve the threat to the left flank, but were still breached by Japanese forces. According to the latest reports, Japanese aircraft bombed west of Kuala Lumpur, causing only a few casualties. Simultaneously, the British Air Force bombed Japanese airfields in the northern Kedah area several times, but due to poor visibility, ground damage could not be observed.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Domei News Agency) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced tonight that Japanese troops advancing on the Malay Peninsula are currently attacking British defenses outside Kuala Lumpur. Japanese troops stormed through Tanjong Malim (approximately 50 miles from Kuala Lumpur) last night, advancing over twenty miles. British forces retreating south continue to apply pressure, fortifying roads to slow the Japanese advance. British forces are also fighting desperately on the southern border between Selangor and Perak, attempting to break through the Japanese encirclement, but were pushed towards the Strait of Malacca by Japanese forces advancing southeast. The Japanese General Headquarters also disclosed that in the battle of Jemaluang, 300 British troops were killed and 200 captured. Japanese casualties were 17 killed and 60 wounded. Japanese forces also seized 68 artillery pieces, 50 light armored vehicles, and 500 cars and motorized troops. The General Headquarters communiqué also announced that Japanese aircraft operating in Burma bombed the port of Moulmein near Rangoon yesterday, hitting one large ship and four small boats. It is reported that Japanese aircraft bombed the Singapore area this morning, but details are unknown.</p>
<p>Singapore, 9th (Reuters) – The British Commander announced last night that after the Japanese forces breached the British defense line in western Malaya, the defending troops were forced to retreat to the south bank of the Slim River in Lower Perak, suffering considerable losses. The Japanese forces continued their fierce attack throughout the day. The Slim River marks the border between Perak and Selangor. British forces in the Selangor area launched a counterattack to alleviate the Japanese threat to the left flank. The situation remains unchanged, except for indications that the Japanese are advancing eastwards.</p>
<p>A Major Battle is About to Unfold in Kuala Lumpur</p>
<p>Singapore, 9th (Reuters) – The main British line in western Malaya remains north of Selangor. Judging from today's battle situation, the fighting on this line will quickly develop into a battle for Kuala Lumpur. The city is the capital of the Federated Malay States and the center of the Malayan rubber industry. Martial law was declared last night. Japanese forces launched a fierce attack on the main British positions between Ipoh and Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday, and continued the attack on Thursday. The British forces, following a policy of avoiding holding unfavorable areas, retreated to the far bank of the Slim River, about 55 miles north of Kuala Lumpur. The Japanese forces, with mechanized equipment and air support, exerted great pressure. Some British positions were inevitably pressured, as officials have admitted that British artillery and transport vehicles suffered "some losses." Japanese forces in the Tanjung area between the Bernam River and Selangor have not yet completed mopping-up operations, and some Japanese troops have penetrated. However, British forces still hold the main line north of Selangor. Kuala Lumpur city is fully preparing for a major battle. A curfew has been implemented, and many Chinese, Indians, Malays, and British have been evacuated. Most of the civil defense forces have also been moved to Singapore. It is expected that the British forces will defend Kuala Lumpur. Furthermore, it was initially disclosed today that British mobile units and guerrillas are operating behind Japanese lines.</p>
<p>Japanese Military Base in Malaya, 9th (Domei News Agency) – British forces in northern Selangor have been defeated by Japanese forces and are retreating towards Negeri Sembilan. Bridges and roads have been hastily destroyed. Chaos has also erupted in southern Selangor.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Domei News Agency) – The Yomiuri Shimbun carries a dispatch from the Japanese military base in Malaya, stating that according to Singapore radio reports, British troops are fighting a desperate battle south of the Perak and Selangor border, attempting to break through the Japanese encirclement and flee south. The British troops in that area will be surrounded by Japanese forces near the Strait of Malacca.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Haitong News Agency) – News from the Malayan front received here last night stated that the Japanese assault troops occupied a strongly fortified city named "Mijii" in Selangor on the 7th afternoon. This has led to speculation among Japanese people as to whether Kuala Lumpur, the capital of the Federated Malay States, is already in Japanese hands. It is claimed that the Japanese occupied a strategically important area with extremely strong defensive works. While the fate of Kuala Lumpur has not been confirmed, it is believed that fierce fighting is taking place around the city. The Japanese are gaining considerable advantage in the operations in Selangor and are continuing to advance rapidly southwards.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japanese Army Official Discusses Japanese-Soviet Relations <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Domei News Agency) – A senior official of the Ministry of the Army declared today that rumors of renewed border clashes between Japanese and Soviet troops are untrue. The purpose of such rumors is clearly to incite anti-Japanese sentiment among the Japanese people. According to observers, Japanese-Soviet relations will continue to be based on the current neutrality treaty, and there will be no changes. A permanent fisheries agreement is also expected to be negotiated and established before the March fishing season. The Soviet authorities are unlikely to allow themselves to be exploited by belligerent countries.</p>
<p>Reports of Military Talks in Chita</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Haitong News Agency) – The Hochi Shimbun published an article today, frankly warning the Soviet Union to maintain the spirit of the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Treaty and not to listen to the incitement of Britain and America. Since the Moscow Conference, cooperation between the Soviet Union, Britain, and America has become increasingly close. Now, at the request of the United States, the Soviet Union and the Chongqing government have sent representatives to hold military talks in Chita. President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill have expressed their hope that the Soviet Union will actively participate in the war in East Asia. What does this mean? It is worth noting that although the United States has promised to provide the Soviet Union with 100 million yuan in military supplies, whether this can be realized is still doubtful. If Moscow does not realize this and is misled by the treacherous schemes of Britain and America, then the Asian part of the Soviet Union may become separated from the country. The U.S. Navy Department has now expressed its willingness to acquire bases such as Vladivostok and Nikolaevsk. Its ambition has gradually been exposed, and the Soviet Union should wake up in time.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Fierce Battles on All Fronts in the Philippine Islands <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>

<p>Tokyo, 9th (Domei News Agency) – Japanese forces in the Philippines are continuing to attack U.S. forces fighting from a defensive position on the Bataan Peninsula.

The U.S. Army Department communiqué stated that Japanese forces had again landed on the Bataan Peninsula, increasing pressure.</p>
<p>Washington, 9th (Reuters) – The United States Army Department announced at 2:30 p.m. yesterday that battles are taking place on all fronts in the Philippine war zone. Japanese forces appear to be preparing for a large-scale offensive, and Japanese reinforcements are still being sent to the front lines. However, there have been no bombing raids over the fortresses in Manila Bay, except for Japanese reconnaissance aircraft. This is the first time in several days.</p>

<p>Rangoon, 9th (Reuters) – The Army and Air Force General Headquarters announced last night that five British aircraft attacked several airfields in Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, twice yesterday. One British aircraft is missing.

<p>Saigon, 9th (Domei News Agency) – Batavia Radio announced yesterday that the government of the Netherlands East Indies has requested Australia to send aircraft to assist in patrolling the key points of the East Indies and Bantam, as the Netherlands Indies government is unable to protect the key points of its territory.</p>
<p>Batavia, 8th (Havas Agency) – Military authorities of the Netherlands East Indies have just released a war report stating that seven Japanese aircraft bombed Ambon Island several times, resulting in one soldier killed and several wounded.

<p>Honolulu, 9th (Havas Agency) – The new Army Commander of Hawaii, Lieutenant General Simmons, declared to the press today that Japanese forces may attack Hawaii again at any time, but this time we will not be unprepared.

<p>Stockholm, 9th (Haitong News Agency) – According to reports from Washington, General Robinson reported to the U.S. Senate Naval Committee that the Japanese army's landing on Luzon Island was protected by a very comprehensive fleet, making it impossible for U.S. submarines to attack, and therefore unable to prevent the Japanese landing.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 9th (Haitong News Agency) – The Director of Information of the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters gave a broadcast speech yesterday, responding to claims by Britain and the United States that they would launch a major offensive in East Asia, saying that if the Allied forces of Britain and the United States dare to launch an offensive in East Asia, the Japanese army is prepared to accept their challenge at any time. The Japanese navy has now expanded to operate in the Pacific, and enemy commercial shipping in the Pacific has come to a standstill. Now, Admiral Hart, Commander of the U.S. Far East Fleet, has recently been appointed as the joint commander of the British and American navies in the Southwest Pacific. We really don't know what British naval officers think. Are they willing to be commanded by him? The British fleet used to have the honor of ruling the seven seas, but now its position has declined and it is subject to the control of the U.S. military. But wherever Admiral Hart's fleet goes, the Japanese navy will give it a head-on blow.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 9th. The British government has decided to train "Air Force Marines." This is an unprecedented move in British history. According to Lord Privy Seal Major Attlee's announcement in the House of Commons yesterday, "Our country has lost approximately fifteen airfields in Malaya. However, these airfields were not captured by paratroopers or airborne transport units, but fell along with the surrounding areas. After careful consideration and with the unanimous recommendation of the Army, Navy, and Air Force authorities, the government has decided that the Army will continue to be responsible for all land defense, while the Air Force will separately compile and train Marines to be responsible for the local defense of airfields throughout the British mainland."</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, 9th. Yesterday, the British House of Lords strongly criticized the British government for its inadequate preparations in the Far East. Labor Party member Lord Addison questioned why General Brooke-Popham was still able to make such optimistic remarks on the eve of the outbreak of war. Although the Commander-in-Chief of the Far East is an Air Force expert, he does not appear to have made any preparations to defend the airfields. Liberal Party member Samuel pointed out the tense situation between Britain and India and Australia, stating that the British government should urgently promote a united front in India. Lord Strabolgi commented on the situation in Hong Kong and Malaya, stating that the British government should have sought cooperation with China to obtain a large number of Chinese troops to defend British possessions in East Asia. After Colonial Secretary Moyne, representing the government, issued the same statement as Attlee in the House of Commons, Addison stated that the issue of defending airfields should be discussed in a secret meeting. The government agreed, and the House of Lords held a secret meeting.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 8th. After Lord Privy Seal Attlee delivered his speech, the House of Commons held a debate. Speakers unanimously expressed their support for Churchill's trip to the United States and the talks held there. Some members criticized the authorities' handling of the current situation. Conservative Party member Galbraith raised questions about Madagascar still being under the control of the Vichy government. It is said that this vast island has extreme strategic importance, and I hope the government will take appropriate steps. Member Conant questioned why the government allowed the "Prince of Wales" and "Repulse" to sail to Singapore alone. Sir Patrick Hannon stated that the situation in the Pacific requires the government to provide many explanations. The Dutch have fought bravely and have been very successful, but there seems to be a lack of coordination. Hannon warned against viewing the Pacific as a secondary theater of war.</p>
<p>Wavell's Authority</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, London, 8th. Lord Privy Seal Attlee, representing Prime Minister Churchill, delivered a speech in the House of Commons today, emphasizing the need for the greatest possible coordination of British and American war efforts. He said, "The purpose of the Prime Minister's trip to the United States is to coordinate British and American war efforts. The main results he has obtained, I believe, are already known to the members of this House. The most important of these are the joint declaration issued by twenty-six nations and the appointment of General Wavell as Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific Theater. General Wavell's staff is composed of British, American, Australian, and Dutch East Indies officers. In addition, Chinese General Chiang Kai-shek has also agreed to serve as Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Land and Air Forces in the China Theater. However, the above-mentioned achievements are only part of the Allied forces' adjustment of their broad operational plans. Other issues will also be determined one after another soon. As for the extent of General Wavell's authority, as asked by Mr. Pethick-Lawrence, the area stretching west from Burma, through the Philippines and the Malay Archipelago, to the northern coast of the Commonwealth of Australia, all falls within General Wavell's jurisdiction, except for India and the Australian mainland. In short, the Prime Minister's visit to Washington, despite his hard work, has achieved significant results and will surely be appreciated by the members of this House. As for the recent Far Eastern war in the past month, it is undeniable that Japan has gained some advantages due to its strategic position. Japanese troops launched a full-scale attack on Hong Kong on December 8. After two days of fierce fighting, they landed in two places. Although our troops were in a situation of overwhelming numerical inferiority and difficult supply, they were still able to resist heroically until the 25th of last month. During this period, the Chinese Allied forces even launched an offensive in an attempt to relieve the pressure on Hong Kong. In other areas, British troops north of Kuala Lumpur in Malaya have also been forced to withdraw."</p>
<p>Eden Responds to Criticism</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, London, 8th. During today's meeting of the House of Commons, Labor Party member Stokes criticized the conduct of the war and Prime Minister Churchill's policies, to which Foreign Secretary Eden replied, stating, "Prime Minister Churchill has participated directly or indirectly in almost every war that has occurred in modern times. All of the Dominions are kept informed of the various decisions made by the War Cabinet and have full qualifications to participate in opinions. The Prime Minister of Canada said when he visited London last summer that he was very satisfied with the conduct of the war. The Prime Minister of New Zealand shares the same view. Only the Commonwealth of Australia has a different view. I do not want to insist that the current system is perfect and cannot be improved, but all decisions must be made freely by the parliaments of the Dominions and cannot be taken over by others. The representatives of the British Dominions in Britain must also be responsible to their respective national parliaments, just as we are responsible to the House of Commons. This is something to be noted. "The Foreign Secretary then expressed his admiration for the brave attitude of the Dutch East Indies and reported on his trip to Moscow, stating, "The Red Army leaders are not only pursuing the retreating German troops, but also using the winter ceasefire to reorganize their troops. They do not believe that all crises have passed or that the German army has been completely annihilated, but even with the achievements made so far, it is enough to guarantee that there will be major changes in the future."</p>
<p>U.S. Regrets Criticism</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Washington, 8th. British House of Commons' yesterday's criticism of American military action has been met with surprise and regret by political figures here. British members of parliament have expressed their fear that Britain will one day become an American outpost. For example, Labor Party member Stokes said in the House of Commons, "There is a feeling that the center of military power will shift to Washington, and our country will be in the position of 'America's Heligoland.'" British commentator Geoffrey criticized the proposal that Allied navies in the Far East be commanded by the United States, writing, "I doubt whether British sailors are willing to obey the orders of foreign officers." All of these things are viewed in the United States as impolite actions towards the United States and consider the United States to have made a significant sacrifice for the common reason. In addition, there has been much criticism of the US Navy suffered in the Pacific. Some observers here also consider it regrettable, and that the US Navy is currently protecting the lifeline of the United Kingdom and the United States in the Atlantic, something we cannot forget, and this also in British sailors, in the Pacific war, also failed to obtain much victory, even to defend Singapore, they had no special achievements to speak of. Recently, the appointment of General Wavell as Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific, American members of parliament did not express a view, just as British members of parliament did. In short, some Britons have spoken carelessly, casting a shadow on the common goals of Britain and the United States, which is regrettable.</p>

<p>Havas News Agency, Washington, 9th. According to the Federal Import-Export Bureau, the United States had a trade surplus with South America in 1941, which is unprecedented.

The reason for the surplus is the U.S.'s large-scale national defense program. The quantity of imports such as sugar and coffee is the same as in previous years, but the quantity of items needed for wartime industries, such as leather and wool, has increased greatly. As for exports, machinery and tools for manufacturing machinery are the largest, to meet the urgent needs of South America. The United States also shipped kerosene, chemicals, textiles, food, and manufactured goods to South American countries, which were originally intended for European countries.</p>

<p>After the Municipal Council restricted the operation of rice shops, in addition to the 250 rice shops that were allowed to exist, the remaining rice shops were limited to close at 4:00 PM yesterday and cease operations from today. As for the rice shops that were allowed to exist, the Municipal Rice and Grain Office supplied large quantities of foreign rice yesterday to provide for universal price-controlled sales from today. The French Concession rice shops also formally announced yesterday that the French Municipal Council will take the same restrictions as the Public Concession, allowing 152 to exist, which are listed below.</p>
<p>Rice Office Issues Large Quantities of Rice</p>
<p>The Municipal Council Board of Directors passed a resolution restricting the operation of 150 rice shops. Yesterday, they applied to the Municipal Council Rice and Grain Office one after another to allocate large quantities of foreign rice. The Office widened the restrictions on the quantities that could be applied for. Previously, the limit for over-application was 30 bags, but from yesterday onwards, it was possible to apply for up to 100 bags. In addition to designating stacks such as the Jiusifu and Hu, etc., to issue rice, yesterday the Donglai stack at 838 South Suzhou Road was also opened. In total, permits were issued, designating the above-mentioned stacks to extract approximately 10,000 bags of foreign rice in the three days of the 10th, 11th, and 12th.</p>
<p>Rice Shops Universally Sell Rice Today</p>
<p>The rice shops that are allowed to operate will be able to universally sell rice from today because the applications for rice allocation have greatly increased. Their operating hours can be extended, and the crowded conditions of recent days will certainly disappear. At the same time, the rice stacks that have not yet been opened will be opened one after another and distributed to the rice shops to meet the needs of the local people's food supply, so that there will be no shortage. It is sufficient to meet needs and can dispel concerns.</p>
<p>French Concession Also Restricts Rice Shops</p>
<p>In order to keep pace with the Public Concession, the French Municipal Council formally announced yesterday that it would restrict the operation of rice shops in the French Concession. As of August 17 of last year, there were a total of 332 rice shops in the French Concession. The actual number of rice shops currently open is approximately 280. From today onwards, only 152 will be allowed to exist. The remaining rice shops were also limited to closing at 4:00 PM yesterday.</p>
<p>Only 152 Allowed to Exist</p>
<p>From today onwards, the 152 rice shops existing in the French Concession also applied to the Municipal Council Rice and Grain Office to allocate large quantities of foreign rice for retail sales. Therefore, the crowded conditions of competing to purchase foreign rice in the French Concession can also completely disappear from now on. Universal price-controlled rice can be purchased. The price-controlled restrictions in the two concessions are still three liters per person, costing four yuan and one jiao in national currency.</p>

<p>The English-language "Evening Post" reported that the Municipal Council's price control measures will soon be further expanded, and the selling price of flatbread and fried dough sticks will be limited. This is the third type of flour-based food product that the Municipal Council has controlled. The Municipal Council had previously limited the price of flour and then "frozen" the price of machine-made noodles. According to a Municipal Council official, the flour situation has improved since yesterday (the 8th) after the announcement of the Council's campaign to penalize flour shops. Many flour shops apparently received a letter from the Council and were quite afraid, reducing the price of flour from 1.40 yuan per catty to the official limited price of 95 fen. General flour and bread shops have also lowered their prices to comply with the official price limit.</p>
<p>Mass Production of Flatbread and Steamed Buns</p>
<p>The Shanghai Flatbread and Steamed Bun Trade Association received a notice from the Municipal Council stating that they should mass-produce flatbread and steamed buns from this day forward, and all kinds of flaky pastries and all non-essential foods must be stopped immediately.

If continued production occurs, this association will report it to the Municipal Council and stop the supply of flour, and be subject to the revocation of business licenses. It is hoped that all members will strictly comply to avoid causing trouble. This is a special announcement."</p>

Yesterday, an inquiry at the Bureau revealed that the Bureau has a significant amount of funds deposited in British and American banks such as HSBC, Mercantile Bank, and Chase Bank. Due to restrictions on withdrawals from these banks, the Bureau is experiencing difficulties in redeeming drafts. The total amount of drafts from the 8th of last month to the present is approximately several hundred thousand yuan, which is not a very large amount. However, the holders of these drafts are mostly common people, and their suffering must be deep. Therefore, the Bureau is raising cash to clear these drafts and has come up with a solution to announce the cancellation of restrictions and resume redemption within days.</p>

<p>Regarding the curfew passes issued by the French Concession police authorities, the exchange period for white passes numbered 1 to 1100 and orange passes numbered 1 to 800 expired today (the 10th) after the authorities announced the official withdrawal of this year's new passes. Therefore, there has been a large crowd applying for exchange in recent days. However, it is understood that this exchange does not involve the issuance of new passes, but only stamping the old passes with a general validity period to save money.</p>

<p>It was rumored that trams in both concessions were entering the factory earlier at 8:30 PM due to the recent quiet night market and lack of passengers, which was affecting business. It has been learned that this statement is incorrect. All trams in both concessions are maintaining their past operating hours. French Concession trams arrive around 9:15 PM, while Public Concession trams arrive around 10:00 PM. However, French Concession Route 22 buses stop running and enter the factory around 10:00 PM.</p>
<p>Hongkou Tramway Extends Route</p>
<p>Since the Hongkou tramway resumed operation on the 24th of last month, it has temporarily terminated at Waibaidu Bridge and Yokohama Bridge. It is now known that, due to passenger congestion and to facilitate transportation, the tram route was extended to Bazichang, running the entire length of North Sichuan Road, starting at 7:00 AM yesterday. All Route 9 buses that previously ran the Shanghai Jinja Yokohama Bridge line have been temporarily suspended since yesterday. However, the original Route 8 buses still run from Waibaidu Bridge to the Jinja. The trams in the Hongkou district are now scheduled to enter the factory at 10:00 PM every night.</p>

<p>According to the Shanghai Times, when the Pacific War broke out on December 8th last year, a battle occurred in the Huangpu River, resulting in the capture of the gunboat USS Wake and the sinking of the British gunboat HMS Peterel. The captains and crew members were captured and are now detained somewhere in the Shanghai area. They have all sent letters to their wives and friends, which were forwarded by the Japanese naval authorities. Letters from Captain Hull of the Peterel and Captain Smith of the Wake have also been sent. In a letter to his wife dated December 18th, Hull wrote, "We are fortunate that the Japanese naval officers treat us very well." Marine Corps Sergeant Chandler wrote to a friend, "We are well taken care of and receive two English newspapers every day, so we know the news here." Other British and American crew members also stated in their letters that they had received letters and packages and were being treated well.</p>

<p>Yu Yujiu, a native of Shandong residing at No. 5, Lane 137, Wuding Road, was the factory director of the Litaicang Yarn Factory before the war. Later, due to the war, the factory was closed, and all factory land and goods were entrusted to his apprentice, Tao Wenjing, a native of Wuxi, and others for safekeeping. Now that Tao is unemployed, he has repeatedly borrowed money from Yu, who has provided assistance and helped him find a job. The day before yesterday, Tao went to Yu's house and used intimidating language to forcibly borrow 10,000 yuan. Yu reported this to the Gordon Road police station, who dispatched detective Chen Shanji to arrest Tao. Yesterday morning, Tao was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Qian Xun prosecuted him according to law. After questioning by Judge Pu Lan, he was ordered to be detained pending sentencing in fifteen days.</p>

<p>Liang Huishi, a Guangdong woman residing at No. 10, Lane 129, Changsha Road, was murdered on June 1st last year, and her body was dismembered into several pieces and discarded on the roadside. Subsequently, the police arrested Wang Gendi, Wang Ding, Ma Jinhai, Wang Amao, and four others who helped dismember the body and sent them to the court for investigation and punishment. An arrest warrant was issued for the principal culprit, Sun Wang, (Wang Gendi's sister). Now, Wang Runhe, the Chinese detective chief of the Xinzha police station, and detective Chen Baozhong, have arrested Sun Wang (40 years old, native of Suzhou) inside the Xuan Gong Theater. This morning, she was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted her for murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law. He stated that Sun Wang confessed in the police station that she had been living in the same room with the deceased, Zeng Liang, for four years. Their relationship was very close on normal days, and they slept in the same bed every night. Two years ago, the defendant met a friend of the deceased named Yu Dasheng and fell in love with him. They secretly met in rented rooms. When the deceased found out about this, her attitude towards the defendant and Yu changed drastically, and quarrels arose. Out of resentment, Yu threatened to find a way to get rid of the deceased. In May of last year, another fierce quarrel broke out, and Yu decided to kill her. On the morning of June 1st, at 9:00 AM, Yu sneaked into the room while the deceased was still asleep and kneeling on her body, chopped at her with a kitchen knife. The defendant was greatly shocked to see this in the room. She only heard the deceased shout two or three times before becoming silent and covered in blood. Yu covered the body with a quilt and asked the defendant to meet him at the Tongshang Hotel. Several days later, the defendant ordered her son Guo Liang and brother Wang Gendi to ask Wang Amao and Ma Yu Hai for help to cut the body into several pieces. At that time, the defendant was playing mahjong in the room to cover up the sound of dismembering the body. Then, she wrapped the body and discarded the pieces separately. A written confession has been submitted to the court. When questioned, Sun Wang confessed to the above. The judge ordered her to be detained for further investigation at a later date.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, five robbers suddenly broke into a bakery factory at No. 1, Lane 155, Avenue Haig. Four robbers drew guns and one robber threw a grenade to intimidate the workers. They robbed 5,000 yuan in legal tender. Before leaving with the loot, the robbers placed the grenade in front of the factory gate and fled in different directions without a trace. The factory reported the incident to the police, who sent detectives to investigate and took the grenade back to the police station for destruction.</p>
<p>At around 9:00 AM, two robbers, one armed, broke into No. 351 Sinza Road and robbed some items. As they were fleeing outside the door, they were caught by a patrolman. One robber was arrested and a pistol was confiscated.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 6:00 AM, five robbers, two with pistols, broke into a residence at No. 402 Ningbo Road and robbed cash and jewelry worth approximately 4,000 yuan. The robbers entered through the front gate, imprisoned the family members in one room, and left one robber to guard them while the other robbers searched the house. After obtaining the cash and valuables, the five robbers left.</p>
<p>At around 5:30 AM yesterday morning, a cyclist on Changping Road near Little Soochow Creek Road was stopped by five robbers. One of the robbers drew a gun to intimidate him. As a result, 160 yuan in cash and a bicycle worth 300 yuan were robbed.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, No. 778 Chengdu Road was also robbed. One armed robber entered the house and robbed it, prohibiting any noise. After robbing the cash, the robber fled.

<h3 id="e56">Overview of Import and Export Trade Before the Pacific War <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— Written by John Ahlers (Translated by Bo Ming)</p>
<p>The outbreak of the Pacific War has not only cut off Shanghai's trade with Britain and the United States, but also Shanghai's trade with Latin America, the Near East, and various neutral countries in Europe. These neutral countries maintained commercial ties with Shanghai until December 7th. However, to this day, Shanghai can only maintain trade relations with the Japanese Empire, French Indochina, and Thailand. Even if the war in the South China Sea ends soon and the current shortage of cargo ships is eliminated, Shanghai's trade with Japan and other countries can only slightly increase Shanghai's foreign commerce, at least in the short term. In November, foreign goods imported into Shanghai from countries that have recently severed ties accounted for approximately 84 percent. The goods Shanghai imported from these countries in that month included all raw cotton, bituminous coal, wheat, flour, and most of the foreign rice. As for Shanghai's main exports in that month, such as textiles, livestock products, vegetable oil, and groceries, sales in these countries accounted for nearly 75 percent. Shanghai products sold to the Japanese Empire, Vietnam, and Thailand accounted for only a quarter of Shanghai's exports, and the goods Shanghai obtained from the Japanese Empire and other countries accounted for only one-sixth of Shanghai's total imports. However, this small portion of Shanghai's foreign trade in November has a special relationship with the city's commerce, because only this small portion of commerce is continuing, and Shanghai's foreign trade activities can only seek expansion in this direction in the short term. The amount of Shanghai's trade with the Japanese Empire, Vietnam, and Thailand in November and the types of various commodities are described separately below. . In the past month, Shanghai's exports were worth 105,700,000 yuan, of which 27,800,000 yuan were shipped to Japan and other countries. This number cannot be said to be small, but these exports are mostly food, and Shanghai can hardly continue to supply these foods. In November, the Japanese Empire purchased goods from Shanghai worth 19,300,000 yuan, which were distributed as follows: the Kwantung Leased Territory 13,100,000 yuan, mainland Japan 4,100,000 yuan, Taiwan 1,600,000 yuan, and Korea 500,000 yuan. Dalian is the most important transshipment port for Shanghai's exports to the Japanese Empire, and grains and grain products alone have reached 14,800,000 yuan, accounting for three-quarters of the total value. Shanghai exported flour worth 10,365,000 yuan to the Kwantung Leased Territory, various grains (mainly rapeseed, cottonseed cake, soybean cake, and rice) worth 2,326,000 yuan to mainland Japan, and grains (mainly rice, cottonseed cake, and flour) worth 1,371,000 yuan to Taiwan. Other major items purchased by the Japanese Empire from Shanghai include raw cotton worth 1,758,000 yuan, as well as leather and fish, which were shipped to Dalian, small amounts of beans, eggs, fish, waste cotton, and waste silk, which were shipped to mainland Japan, a small amount of textiles, which were shipped to Taiwan, and some fish and textiles, which were shipped to Korea. However, Shanghai's exports to Japan are overwhelmingly food. (To be continued)</p>

<p>At around 9:00 PM last night, a fire suddenly broke out at a certain number in Lane 209, Wuchang Road, with thick smoke spreading everywhere and the fire raging. In an instant, houses numbered 31, 33, 35, 37, and 39 were burned. After the fire brigade received the alarm, they drove to the scene and tried their best to put out the fire, which was finally extinguished. As a result, five buildings were burned down. When the fire was raging, Zhou Youxiang, 23 years old, and Gu Qingrong, 22 years old, escaped from the fire, but were severely burned. They were sent to the hospital for treatment by ambulance. It is said that Gu Qingrong's life may be in danger.</p>

<p>In recent days, unemployed Chinese residents of the city have been registering at the Municipal Council registration office on Fuzhou Road and the Japanese Consulate on Huangpu Road to apply for repatriation to their hometowns. The number of registered people has not been disclosed by the authorities, but it is estimated by relevant parties that no less than 300,000 residents have returned to their hometowns either voluntarily or with the help of the Municipal Council and the Japanese authorities. The Municipal Council has cooperated with the Japanese authorities to agree on a method of transporting residents back to their hometowns by ship and train. According to a spokesman for the Municipal Council, those whose hometowns are near Shanghai can return on foot. As for travel expenses, the relevant authorities will discuss this as the biggest issue. Workers who have lost their jobs due to factory closures have been given severance pay by their employers and can return to their hometowns. The most affected by the unemployment situation are factory workers and dock workers, but many clerks have also applied for repatriation because they cannot afford to support their families. All parties attach great importance to the repatriation of residents, because in the past three years, people from the interior have flocked to Shanghai, causing extreme population congestion and soaring prices.</p>

<p>The Coal Catty Management Committee of the two concessions previously jointly set the standard coal catty selling price for smokeless coal at 360 yuan per ton and for white coal at 600 yuan per ton. All coal merchants were notified separately to comply. It has now been learned that the two authorities are paying special attention to the purchase and sale of coal by coal merchants and have decided to strictly enforce the standard selling price. It is reported that the coal market has virtually stalled. Although sellers are selling domestic goods at the price, buyers are not adding to their purchases. It is learned that the Shanghai Coal Trade Association was ordered by the authorities at the end of last year to process the registration of coal catty sales for the industry. However, due to the New Year holiday, the registration work could not be completed as scheduled. It is now learned that the registration table has been reported to the Municipal Council Coal Catty Control Committee for reference. The number of registered companies is 280. The authorities are now actively expediting the statistics. Once completed, the measures for allocating coal catties will be announced.</p>

<p>Since the debut of mini-soccer, it has spread far and wide. Although the New Year's Cup has temporarily come to an end, applications to participate are still pouring in. The organizer, taking advantage of the Lion brand's fierce opportunity to decide the Asian car, has arranged two more days of exciting programs, with a strong and rich aftermath, showing a tendency to surpass the previous event. Today is the first act of the New Year's Cup. In addition to playing two interlude songs, the highlight is a trial match between Samsung and All Rainbow. Samsung was originally a football team with increased iron strength. Portugal is eager to try this new type of show, so they specially ordered a special performance field and listed it on tomorrow's program.

All Rainbow is full of brave generals, such as Yu Zhenyue, Zhu Weizhong, Ji Wenhu, Cao Yuyu, and their strength is evenly matched with Samsung. Therefore, today's highlights are not only limited to the football field. The two literary interludes to be played today are also excellent works.

<h3 id="e68">Wax Handgun <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— Quan Yi</p>
<p>The weather is cold and the year is coming to an end. The streetlights are dim. A black shadow flashes across the alley, and a cry of "Help!" startles people. Fortunately, Shanghai seems to have understood this trick, which is like puncturing a flat tire with a nail, called "catching pigs." The coat is stripped off, and one has to be a "pig." However, the market at the end of the year is different. In remote places, it is indeed a place where "butchers" haunt. Even in bustling areas, one may accidentally have something hard pressed against your waist. You cannot shout, and you are unwilling to take off your pants. Although people come and go on the roadside, they are all minding their own business, and they may even think that you are friends joking around. In this situation, even a friend of a gangster cannot be asked to show his weapon.</p>
<p>A newspaper reported that the Old Gate Police Station cracked a number of robbers and confiscated two wax handguns. The use of these two fake handguns is self-evident, and they are specifically used to intimidate and cause trouble. For those who strip off people's coats and call them "pigs" when their families are sick and need to hire someone, they are indeed hateful and should be killed. However, using wax to replace the "real thing" is only intended to borrow someone's coat to pawn it for some money, which is also pitiful. Other incidents, such as forcibly snatching food in front of food shops, can be summed up as being hungry. Therefore, the current problem is not to passively prevent by advising people not to go out at night or to travel in groups, but to actively provide relief to bring these people back on track!</p>
<p>Shanghai Perspective</p>
<h3 id="e69">Banks, Commercial Stations, Factories <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Feng</p>
<p>The night before yesterday, I invited two friends to have a simple meal at home. One friend was a clerk in a bank, and the other was a salesperson in a large department store on Nanjing Road. When we met, we all spontaneously focused our conversation on the current situation of Shanghai's finance, industry, and commerce. First, Little Zhang talked about the situation in their company. He said:</p>
<p>"Since February 8th last year, the company's business has plummeted. In the past, the average daily turnover was about 200,000, but now it is only between 60,000 and 80,000, a 30% or 40% decrease. In the past, the end of the lunar year was truly a golden age for business. For example, on Christmas Eve the year before last, the turnover reached 600,000. Last Christmas, prices rose, but the turnover was only 70,000, which is really staggering. The company authorities have stipulated that except for fast-selling goods such as bread and biscuits, all purchases are stopped. If this continues, the future is unimaginable... Colleagues are all worried about the instability of their jobs and are in a state of panic."</p>
<p>Ah Li continued: "In my personal opinion, such a deeply rooted department store can withstand the wind and rain for the time being. It is the small banks like ours that rely on speculation in gold and yarn flowers, with no monthly targets for pawnshop business, and credit lending like high-interest loans. Now the speculative market has collapsed, and the pawned goods cannot be sold. I don't know when they can be cleared. The industry and commerce are so turbulent, and credit lending is also risky. Moreover, there is no surplus capital. The worst thing is that the deposit accounts are not being repaid, and the savings accounts are constantly being withdrawn. Looking at it this way, I don't know how the settlement report at the end of the lunar year will be made!" After listening to them, because I work in a factory, I talked about the situation in the factory:</p>
<p>"I say, the factories are actually the first to bear the brunt. Now I have heard of many factories being disbanded, but I have not heard of many shops and banks closing down. This is because factories rely on selling their products to exchange for money to cover manufacturing costs. The current situation is that the products cannot be sold, but the daily manufacturing costs cannot be avoided. This cost is much higher than the daily expenses of shops and banks. Those who cannot afford to cover the costs have no choice but to declare dissolution."</p>
<p>"The population of Shanghai is dispersed, the purchasing power of the citizens has decreased, and large companies, factories, and banks are slowly losing their space for existence. The market in Shanghai has entered a long night."</p>
<p>This was everyone's unanimous conclusion.</p>

<p>Originally, after Chen Yunshang returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong, she was preparing to star in Bu Wancang's fashion film "Private Love" and costume film "Wang Zhaojun." However, these two films were delayed for more than a month and never started. Until the day before yesterday, news came that Bu Tongcang had decided to abandon these two scripts and instead use Gu Zhongyi's "Seeing the Light Again." The story is about a poor woman who becomes blind due to stimulation, but is finally stimulated and excited to regain her sight. In addition to Chen Yunshang starring, it was also decided that Gu Yelu, Chen Juanjuan, and Xi Qiu Xia would cooperate, and filming would officially begin soon.</p>
<p>With the advent of "A Modern Hell," Han Langan's film "Congratulations on Getting Rich" was originally scheduled to be released by the United Nations during the New Year, but it was delayed due to the filming of Yang Xiaozhong's "Shanghai Taoyu Ji." Unexpectedly, when he was recently about to start work, Zhang Shanxian suddenly ordered the production department that all new films, except those with special permission, whose scripts had been approved but not yet filmed, would be suspended. Han Langan himself is the director of the production department, and as an example, he was the first to announce the abandonment of the plan to film "Congratulations on Getting Rich." At the same time, "First Love," starring Chen Juanjuan, also suffered the same fate and was aborted!</p>
<p>Recently, there have been rumors that Jin Xing may be revived. The author visited the relevant personnel of the company. According to them, they have temporarily suspended operations because Jin Xing originally filmed at Datong Photography Studio. After the contract expired, they moved to the Meicheng factory to work, but after "Peach Blossom Lake" was completed, the contract expired, and there was no photography studio to borrow for a while. As for their own new factory, it will be completed by the end of February at the earliest, so they will have to revive at that time. At the same time, Lianxing Company's "Weak Woman" "Bi Xue Qian Qiu" was delayed because the heroine Ying Yin was busy playing "Beijing People" for Lafei. By the time the set was built and preparations were made to start filming, the sound of cannons on January 28th rang out. Due to various difficulties in material resources, it also temporarily closed its doors after Xing Xi.</p>
<p>The program following "Plum Blossom Dream" at the Xuan Palace Theater is "A Spring Thunder," directed by Wu Jiangfan. This script was performed by the Shanghai Drama Society, but because the Shanghai Drama Society disbanded, it is being performed by Xuan Palace. During the Lunar New Year, "Spring Banquet Song" will be staged, which is based on the world-famous work "The Dinner at Eight," written by Shi Huawen and directed by Fei Mu.</p>

<p>Sixteen. The Fire of Youth</p>
<p>But Xiangqi didn't want to treat Shaohua as a godson. She wanted to treat him as a different kind of close junior... Shaohua was only one year older than Meibao!</p>
<p>"If I could find Meibao back, who in this family wouldn't love her? Maybe my brother and sister-in-law would make their demands on the first day, and then..." A kind of fantasy that middle-aged women often have was constantly floating in Xiangqi's mind. However, the pity was that she herself still didn't know where Meibao was!</p>
<p>Because Meibao had no whereabouts, the development of her fantasy completely stopped in a state of helplessness. However, she was still very concerned about everything about Shao Hua. Although the lessons at the university were no longer something she could guide, whenever Shao Hua was at home, she always had a conversation with him about the things at school. Because Shao Hua felt that his parents were too materialistic and didn't understand what learning was all about, he felt that only his aunt could talk to him when he got home. Therefore, not only would he answer everything that Xiangqi asked, but he would also often tell her things that Xiangqi hadn't asked about. For example, he would tell her in detail which classmate he was closest to, which movie theater he saw a movie at on Sunday, etc., and he would never hide anything like he did in front of his parents.</p>
<p>Xiangqi felt that his personality was too straightforward and too rash, so she would sometimes persuade him a few words, but she always spoke very gently, so that Shao Hua was more willing to accept it than being scolded loudly by his father.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Yue Opera <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— Zefu</p>
<p>Yue Opera, formerly known as Shaoxing Opera, was originally called Dudu Opera or Small Song Opera. Dudu means that when this opera is performed, only drums and clappers are used to keep time, sounding like a dudu. The opera originated in Sheng County, Shaoxing. At first, it was a kind of song, with a pause every three or four sentences or five or six sentences, followed by sounds such as "ahe," "yin a," and "yin a" as the ending. In the second year of the Republic of China, Wang Guilao and Tong Dabao from Tongjia Village in Shengxi began to arrange the songs they sang into dramas and perform them on stage. The performances, such as "The Pipa Story," "Jin Ping Mei," and "Smiling Marriage," were all excessively lewd, more so than Flower Drum Opera, so they were very popular with the general public. In the eleventh year of the Republic of China, various amusement venues in Shanghai also had performances of this opera. At the same time, the instruments and costumes were improved, unlike the previous simplicity. Later, the organizers, due to the lack of male actors to attract audiences, trained female actors aged fifteen or sixteen to perform in Shanghai and arranged new dramas, adding scenery. As a result, people from all walks of life praised each other. Those who were previously unknown in amusement venues are now forming their own troupes and opening theaters to perform. At a time when local operas in Shanghai (such as Su Tan and Yong Tan) are declining, this opera has developed more than before. It can be said that it has been uniquely favored and is the pride of the opera world.</p>

<h3 id="e75">The Food Supply for the City's Residents Improves Slightly, But the Crowds Buying Rice Remain <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the source of national rice was similar to the previous day, with only about one hundred piculs of early thin rice and thirty to forty piculs of thick japonica rice. The vendors were not discouraged by slow sales, and the asking prices continued to rise. The opening price for thin rice was 210 yuan, and for early rice it was 212 yuan, an increase of two or three yuan compared to the previous day. However, after this increase, few people inquired, and the vendors had no choice but to lower the price to sell. As a result, thin rice was still sold for 208 yuan, and then for 206 yuan. Early rice was sold for 209 yuan and then for 208 yuan and 50 cents, with little difference from the previous day. Since the arrival of thick japonica rice was scarce, it was inevitably in demand, and the selling price increased by about two yuan. The opening price was 232 yuan and 229 yuan. As for the yin yuan rice, there were only about ten piculs, and the price was 209 yuan. After the authorities implemented the universal public sale of foreign rice, the crowds of ordinary people buying rice have not diminished, because people's hearts are still uneasy. If the authorities seek better policies, then the food supply for the city's residents can be celebrated with joy.</p>
<p>Bulk cargo of bran has gradually arrived in Shanghai in small batches. The Japanese factories are gradually accumulating inventory, and it is possible that they will sell off entire batches within days. Therefore, people's hearts have softened, and those who want to digest it are planning to wait a little longer before buying. The market is becoming increasingly sluggish. The prices for Sanxin bran at 56 yuan and bulk bran at 54 yuan and 50 cents are not attracting buyers.</p>

<p>The market for coarse grains remained quiet yesterday. Supply and demand were scarce, and people's hearts were quite dull. The market prices were slightly uneven. Generally speaking, edible oil rose slightly, while soybeans and corn were sluggish. The selling price for 100 loads of Dayou Factory oil was 270 yuan. 100 bags of Tianjin Jinyuan were priced at 109 yuan or 110 yuan. 30 bags of Father Qing beans were priced at 98 yuan. 20 bags of Chongming sand silkworms were priced at 62 yuan. 150 bags of Saigon new corn were priced at 50 yuan to 50 yuan and 50 cents. 100 bags of Dutch corn were priced at 48 yuan and 50 cents. 60 bags of Yangzhou Xinsheng kernels were priced at 205 yuan to 210 yuan. 100 pieces of Xingji soybean cakes were priced at 23 yuan and 50 cents.</p>

<p>Over-the-counter trading of government bonds is gradually becoming more lively. Although the market has not officially opened, the number of people gathering is gradually increasing. However, due to the limited time for banks to collect and settle, the trading time is short, and the market prices are gradually rising. Tongshun, Tongyi, Qianyi, and others are buying in, while Dahua, Lianhe, and Shengda are selling out. Type C bonds initially seemed weak, and after opening at 60 yuan and 10 cents, the price fell below 60 yuan due to strong selling pressure, with a small price of 59 yuan and 50 cents. Later, after multiple attempts to raise the price, it gradually recovered and reached a high price of 61 yuan and 60 cents. Finally, someone sold at 1 yuan and 50 cents. Type A bonds initially traded at 64 yuan and 70 cents, with a high price of 66 yuan and 89 cents. Type B bonds were raised from 61 yuan and 10 cents to 2 yuan and 56 cents. Type D bonds traded at 58 yuan. Type E bonds were raised from 58 yuan and 70 cents to 9 yuan and 34 cents. The market prices have risen by three to four yuan to six yuan and fifty cents compared to the official prices on December 23rd of last year, which is a remarkable development. The trading volume was approximately 500,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the black market for foreign stocks outside the Public Trade Association mostly saw increases. Jardine Matheson was bid at 60 yuan, but sellers were still asking for 62 yuan. Yeguang Import and Export's asking price has risen to 13-14 yuan. Yangzi's selling price has been raised to 11 yuan. Jardine Brewery was priced at 6 yuan, with demand but no supply. Paper was offered at 6 yuan. The difference between Jardine Cotton Mill's buying and selling prices was only 50 cents, at 26 yuan and 50 cents and 27 yuan, slightly lower by one yuan. Xinghe Cotton Mill was at 6 yuan and 50 cents. Langezhi was at 20 yuan. Asian Navigation was at 9 yuan. Ken Zhi was at 21 yuan. There were few changes in these. Trading volume decreased, and there were no prices for the rest.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the black market for spot gold continued to decline, but the fluctuations were still small. The price has retreated near the 11,000 yuan mark. Rumors and speculation are the reason for the downward trend. The initial asking price in the morning was 11,800 yuan per tael (10 liang), but it quickly fell to 11,600 yuan before any transactions were made, a decrease of 150 yuan. A certain gold shop and jewelry store and Shengda Yong competed to sell, and the market price continued to fall by 350 yuan to 11,250 yuan. Two securities firms absorbed the supply, and a certain gold shop also bought, raising the price to 11,400 yuan. However, the market momentum was weak, and soon the spot gold shop and money shop helped to sell, and the price dropped again by 300 yuan, retreating to 11,100 yuan with ten taels traded. The spot gold shop recovered, and the price rebounded slightly at noon. The price at noon was 11,250 yuan, a decrease of 500 yuan compared to the previous day. The trading price fluctuated by as much as 500 yuan that day, with a trading volume of about 1,000 taels. The selling price for gold ornaments at Yamen and Tongxing was 1,200 yuan per tael (deducting 200 yuan for purchases), with silver quoted at 16 yuan. There were no buyers for black market silver at 11 yuan. Silver dollars were priced at 6 yuan and 50 cents.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign currency market was quite weak. The British pound and the American gold pound both fell by 10 yuan with the spot gold price. The former was 265 yuan, and the latter was 270 yuan. American dollar notes have retreated to 16 yuan and 89 cents. Hong Kong notes have fallen even further to 2 yuan and 50 cents. Military notes have risen to 3 yuan and 85 cents.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for bills of exchange was still flat or discounted by 3 yuan per thousand yuan, the same as the previous day. The interbank lending rate of the Money Industry Association was also flat at 6 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Some Cotton Mills are Shutting Down; Cotton Yarn Sales are Picking Up Again <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market has suddenly become weak. This is because some cotton mills have shut down, leading to low morale. At the same time, speculators have started selling short, and long positions have been forced to close, causing the market to decline. However, the situation for Japanese yarn is good, and it continues to show strength. The opening price for 20-count Shuangma factory single was 2,165 yuan, rising slightly to 175 yuan. Then, selling pressure suddenly intensified, and the market gradually declined, falling to a low of 2,015 yuan. At this time, short positions took profits, and the buying sentiment rebounded, gradually rising back to 2,090 yuan. However, the trading volume of spot yarn was not as strong as the previous day, and the situation declined again, falling to 2,010 yuan at closing. 42-count Lanfeng was priced at 4,050 yuan to 140 yuan. 20-count Yueqin was priced at 2,300 yuan to 330 yuan. 20-count Lanfeng was priced at 2,500 yuan. 20-count Shuiyue was priced at 2,550 yuan. 16-count Hongkuixing was priced at 1,830 yuan. 16-count Jinta was priced at 2,050 yuan. 10-count Qilin was priced at 1,420 yuan. 14-count Jinta was priced at 1,740 yuan. 20-count Tiannv was priced at 2,6560 yuan. 19-count Tiannv was priced at 1,950 yuan. 20-count Shuangma spot was priced at 2,100 yuan to 150 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e80">The So-Called "Floor Spot Yarn" <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Ju</p>
<p>The threshold for cotton yarn trading has changed with the times and is constantly evolving. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the cotton yarn market, which had once come to a standstill, has gradually revived. However, speculative trading has not yet been restored. Only those who buy and sell spot goods are still very active in secret, and the so-called "floor spot yarn" is even more popular. This "new term" "floor spot yarn" had never been seen before December 8th of last year. Outsiders are very secretive about this new term and have a "mysterious feeling," thinking that there are only factory orders (factory warehouse goods) and foreign orders (foreign warehouse goods), and have never heard of "floor goods." According to industry insiders, the so-called "floor spot goods" are spot goods stored in the hands of the firm. Customers can immediately transport them, and there is no need to go through the procedures for handling transport permits, so their value is particularly high, sometimes as high as 300-400 yuan (per piece of yarn). For example, 20-count Tiannv yarn only requires 2,0560 yuan for a factory order, but the floor spot price requires more than 2,400 yuan. However, the increase for Shuangma yarn is less. As for factory order goods, it is necessary to register and obtain permits in advance, which is troublesome and delays delivery, unlike the convenience of "floor spot goods." In short, the price difference between floor spot yarn and factory order goods always depends on whether the customer's need is urgent or not, and its market price varies. If the need is urgent, the price increase is particularly high, and vice versa. Therefore, this "floor spot yarn" adds another term to the commercial dictionary. Although this term has appeared in the cotton yarn news in this newspaper, it is revealed here because readers may not understand it.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Factory Order Demand is Sluggish; Fabric Prices are Weak <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The factory cloth market was stable yesterday. Due to news of the takeover of various cotton mills, the demand for factory orders suddenly weakened, and prices turned weak. However, spot goods were still in short supply. Huadie coarse cloth factory orders were priced at 89 yuan and 50 cents, down 5 cents, but spot goods still cost 115 yuan. Yihua Shuangxiang coarse cloth factory orders were priced at 95 yuan, and spot goods were 110 yuan. 14-pound cloth was priced at 87 yuan. 13-pound cloth was priced at 85 yuan. 11-pound cloth was priced at 77 yuan and 50 cents. 9-pound cloth was priced at 68 yuan. Fugui spun silk was priced at 87 yuan. Dapeng was priced at 88 yuan. Bleached and dyed cloth increased by 1-2 yuan. The street traded more than 200 pieces of various brands of spot goods, and customers purchased more than 100 pieces.</p>
<p>The East cloth market did not change much yesterday. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth factory orders opened at 89 yuan and 12 cents in the morning. Customer demand was sluggish, falling to 88 yuan and 75 cents. The price rebounded to 89 yuan at noon. The buying sentiment in the afternoon turned strong, and sales reached 90 yuan. However, due to the mediocre performance of mid-range fine cloth at the close, the price fell to 89 yuan and 75 cents, but this was an increase of 5 cents compared to the previous day. Caiqiu fine cloth was priced at 85 yuan and 25 cents, a decrease of 2 cents. Sijunzi serge new orders opened at a high of 3 yuan and 23 cents, with a low of 3 yuan and 17 cents. The closing price in the evening was 3 yuan and 22 cents, a slight decrease of one cent.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Daylily Exports are Active <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The export trade of daylily has been very active recently, with the Taiwan gang being the most active. It has been found that the total amount completed before and after has reached one thousand and several hundred dan. This is the largest purchase since the international situation changed, so ordinary goods have been almost completely bought up. In addition, the inventory of firms is not much, and they are unwilling to sell at high prices for a while. There is also a part that is sealed in bank warehouses, which will be difficult to move in the short term, so there is great hope for a rebound in the future market.</p>

<p>All those who retail sugar in stores are considered Category A sugar merchants; those who sell sugar-made food products are considered Category B sugar merchants. The amount of each type of sugar needed each month should be accurately budgeted independently, and an application form filled out month by month and submitted to this office. After verification, a purchase certificate will be issued, allowing the merchant to purchase from wholesale merchants. The 25th, 26th and 27th days of each month are the application period for the sugar needed for the following month. Applications will not be accepted outside of this period. If an increase or decrease is required, the reason should be stated clearly. Category A sugar merchants are only allowed to retail the sugar purchased from wholesale merchants and must sell at the official retail price. Overcharging, under-weighing, or adulteration is prohibited. Category B sugar merchants are only allowed to use the sugar purchased from wholesale merchants as raw materials for manufacturing food products and are not allowed to resell it to other sugar merchants. The amount of sugar purchased must not exceed the amount needed for one month. To prevent hoarding, the accounts and stock levels of sugar may be checked at any time. (End)</p>

<p>Recently, due to the long-term disruption of supply and diminishing stocks in the market, the price of longan has increased significantly, with another increase of fifty yuan. Before the supply of top-grade sun-dried longan pulp was cut off, the price was already unusually weak. However, due to the aforementioned reasons, the price has gradually tightened, and the increase has reached over two hundred yuan.</p>

<p>Due to fewer arrivals of dried persimmons, and slow sales, good quality goods once fell below the hundred-yuan mark. Recently, sales have become more active, and quotations are trending tighter. Therefore, boxed persimmons are opening at one hundred and ten yuan to one hundred and five yuan, and bagged green persimmons at ninety yuan.</p>

<p>Since the price limit on Hong Ji lump coal, stores have had to mix in lower-quality goods to reduce costs. Therefore, Liujiang white coal has been selling very well in the market recently. Yesterday, the inter-trade breakup price for lump coal was between four hundred and fifty yuan and sixty yuan per ton, with a daily turnover of thirty to forty tons, a near one-hundred-yuan increase compared to last month, which was quite unexpected. However, coal dust remains flat, with little fluctuation.</p>

<p>Recently, due to sluggish sales, raw starch has been unable to improve, despite the lack of continued supply, and the situation remains flat and weak. Current market prices are around 180 yuan for Flying Unicorn brand, 150 yuan for Old Unicorn brand, 125 yuan for Double T brand, and 108 yuan for C brand.</p>
