<p>——讀河邊總參謀長「告在華日軍將士」誌感並略申我國國民之態度——</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭周年紀念日，日駐華派遣軍總參謀長河邊正三氏發表「告在華日軍將士」文，誦讀再四，除對河邊氏「關於大東亞戰爭之完成與中日關係之解決」之正確遠見，和他對中國人民推誠相見，激勸日本將士的精神。表示摯誠的欽敬以外，覺得還有不少感想，必須站在中國人民的立塲，有所申述。</p>
<p>第一，關於在華日軍將士之態度，河邊氏以（一）確立至嚴之軍紀；（二）實踐「誠」字；（三）尊重中國人之傳統習慣三點，爲勸勉之中心。在軍紀方面，日軍素以軍紀嚴明著稱於世，且日軍士兵皆爲受有相當敎育的子弟，平時在國內或爲遵守法紀的人民，或爲久受嚴格軍訓而習於軍紀的軍人，所以「至嚴之軍紀」一點，中國方面，無有敢以懷疑者；不過中國的社會環境複雜，各地土豪劣紳以及無知無識的投機份子，難免不向日軍將士進行種種誘惑，和假借權威，濫行胡爲，以至直接間接影饗到軍紀上面的，這是不能不倍加警惕的。</p>
<p>其次，說到「誠」，日本當局，在五年來，迭有聲明，我國各方，也不乏正確認識的反響。但誠如河邊氏所說：「渝方仍執迷不悟，繼續抗戰，此乃因尚求信任日本之誠意故也」。我們還得補充的，問題不在渝方當局對於日本誠意之是否信任而在中國人民對於日本誠意有無正確的認識，中國的哲學，重在一個「誠」字，中國民間，也普遍地以「誠」字來衡量人與人相處間的友善關係，甚至推廣而至人與神之間的關係，如「誠則靈」，如「誠可通神」，如「精誠所至，金石爲開」，都是中國數千年來人生哲學民間哲學的結論。歷史上無論那一代統治者，對老百姓有「誠」的，便爲人民所愛戴。現在日軍在中國，是爲「解放中國，脫出英美之壓迫，助其完成獨立，與之永結善隣之誼一（見河邊氏原文）這是中國一部分知識階級所早經了解的，不過現在的問題，不是少數的中國政府當局和一部份知識份子的了解與信任，而是必須老百姓能澈底了解與信任，才能有助於兩國善隣之誼</p>
<p>再次，河邊氏特別提及「尊重中國人之傳統習慣」一點，尤具卓見，也大爲重要。事情往往是這樣：中國人民對於日軍軍紀無寗是眞誠信賴的，對於日軍的「誠」字，也有相當的認識。可是，由於中日人民傳統習慣間的不同，往往使前述兩者的努力，受到不良的影響，更因爲雙方的隔閡，日本軍人氣質與中國人民特有的耿直態度間的隔閡，往往會以小小的問題，而發生極大的誤會。這裏一方面須要加緊兩國文化的溝通，不僅在中國推廣日語及日本文化的官揚，而且必需要日本軍民多多硏究中國的語言，文字與歷史和社會狀態風俗習慣等等。另一方面還得加强「克已」的心理，和「互諒」的情緒，並用「眞誠」來補助嚴明的軍紀。我們要認清，處此大東亞戰爭時代，中日兩國需要於協力的地方，一定很迫切，所以雙方朝野必須立刻努力去實現。</p>
<p>第二，河邊氏在「中日親善始自派遣軍」蛸「常思前方之塲與後方之勞苦」，雖爲對日軍將士而發，但在中國人民讀後，其感想之深，一定不在日軍將士之下的。無庸諱言，除絕少數特出的人物以外，中國大多數人民對於政治沒有學理上的硏究，缺乏觀察的能力和遠大的眼光，他們只憑着直覺。他們對日本軍人到中國作戰，沒有什麼眞確的認識，但是他們有一個歴代遞傳下來的心理，就是誰來了對他們更有利益，他們就推戴誰，就敬愛誰。同樣的，中國人民也不是沒有犧牲的精神，但是要有一種力　或方法，使他們認識這種犧牲是爲了他們的榮譽，利益。在這裏政治的複雜的因素，他們是不能理解的，他們的政治輝解就是這樣簡單，但是這就是目前加强中日協力工作中値得注意和研究的地方。</p>
<p>我們讀了河邊氏這一文之後，有敢於進一步獻言的的有兩點：第一，對於協助日本軍隊工作的中國工作人員或翻譯人員，務須採取嚴格的甄選制度。尤其是：（一）在錄用之前，必須經過相當時期，—至少六月或一年—使對於日本對華的眞意日本派遣軍來華的使命具有充分與激底的認識，對於工作的態度和方法技術等有充分的切實的了解；（二）在錄用之後，仍應利用各種適當的塲合和方法，繼續訓練，使有較高的造詣，並注重於品性的培養，節操的鼓勵。能在中國人民中發生良好的印象。（三）對於工作，學識，能力，尤其是他的品性行爲，還須建立必要的考查和獎懲制度，這種制度要比一般的更加認眞。只有在這種制度和辦法之下，才能不致輕率用人而累及日軍聲譽，更能因爲善於用人而增進中日協力的程度。第二我們站在中國人民的立塲，摯誠希望對於日本派遺軍的下級士兵及關係工作人員，加强政治訓練，時常講解中國語言，文字，壓史，風俗，習慣，以及社會組織等，使對各方面都有相當的認識與了解，然後在與中國人民接觸的時候，便可避免無謂的誤會，便可避免舌人及間接接觸人員之從中舞弊等情事，而對於中日協力也有了直接的幫助，發生更大的效果。</p>
<p>同時，因爲河邊氏這篇文字，更使我們感到硏究中國入民對日本派遣軍和友邦僑民應有的態度問題。首先，我們自然更需要對日本的對華政策，對日本派遣軍的在華使命，和對於中日人民間相互的關係，具備更充分的和澈底的認識，了解，與信任。這種認識，了解與信任，絕對不能限於標語·口號·言論·文宇·上面，而要在實際的行動上表現出來，正似我們希望於日本方面的一樣。不過我國一般平民的敎育和組織都不甚完善，因此我們希望負責這一方面的當局對此特別注意，尤其重要者不在於灌輸式的强迫式的工作，即在乎啟發人民自動的要求，發揮其積極性。其次，國人對於友邦軍人方邦僑民，也應有不卑不亢如兄如弟的態度，不卑是表現我們東亞各民族在大東亞戰爭以後抬頭獨立的應有態度，也是兩國人民平等提携互相協力的基礎，不亢是中日互相理解·互相扶助·互相邁進的必要條件。也只有不卑不亢才能如兄如弟，共同協力，爭取光明的前途。當然僅僅實現了這樣還不够，所以，還應該推誠相與，孔子云：「己所不欲，勿施於人」，我們所望於日方對我者是如此，我們所以日方者就更應該如此，尤其在乎率先力行，這就是「誠一字的表現。中國人的哲礎就在一個「誠」字，我們就得先來做個榜樣給人家看。而對日的誠，就是以今日共苦求將來同甘的犧牲精神，就是要準備着更大的犧牲，無限的犧牲，來與日本協力，共同爭取兩國共同的勝利——也就是大東亞戰爭的勝利——東亞民族的解故。</p>
<p>最後，我們要歸結到「題目」「移誠擎熱情於言行」，中日雙方今後都應注意不再有損及對方感情的一舉一動，一言一行，因爲，一千篇親善的文章，一萬句協力的口號，常常爲損及對方感情的一舉手一投足而大大的减少了親善與協力的成效——這是我們誠摯期待於雙方朝野之努力的。因爲誠爲河邊氏所指出的：「中日事變若未能完全解決，則大東亞戰爭決難得完全之勝利。」而中日事變之完全解決，在乎雙力「移誠摯熱情於言行」！</p>

<p>南京八日中央社電　昨（八）日主席爲大東亞戰爭一週年紀念、承接十一月三十日爲中日條約二週年紀念、所發表之告全國國民書、發表再告全國國民書、對於協力大東亞戰爭同甘共苦之意義闡釋至詳、晨間主席並親臨首都民衆興亞大會、首就此義加以說明後、再有一段重要之引伸、指出由和平運動、而協力大東亞戰爭、是進步的同時是一貫的、茲錄全文如左、</p>
<p>由和平運動進而協力大東亞戰爭、這意義是進步的、向時是一貫的、和平運動的眞意、在回復到國父孫先生的大亞洲主義、本來大亞洲主義、是中國國民革命的骨幹、以前雖有此理想、而未得到實現的時機、及至友邦日本、提倡建設東亞新秩序、本於東方道義精神、以求中日的共存共榮、則大亞洲主義、實現的時機已經到來了、所以中國有志之士、立即拋棄了抗戰的觀念、而從事和平運動、這不是轉變、而是回復到國民革命的本來面目、從此以後、認定復興中華、與復與東亞、是一件事、不是兩件事、這種認識在一般民衆訓練上尤其在陸海空軍軍人訓練上、或爲普通的而且深刻的信念、從前有些人、誤解和平、以爲和平是與民休息的、這些誤解、由於不知道在生存競爭的今日、只有積極的進取、決不是消極的退守、可以濟事、又有些人以爲和平是所以恢復國家元氣、養成人民更生的氣力、道也只是片面的見解、因爲進取要有正確的方向與路綫、吾則不惟不能替國家造福、且適足以取禍、如今的生存競爭、不只是國家與國家間的競爭、而是國家集團與國家集團的競爭這種競爭、是國民的總力戰、有積極的進取精神之後就要將這種精神用在某一國家集團方面、心神不二、志嚮不搖、必須道樣才能在競爭中得到勝利、中國應該站在那一方面的國家集團呢、中國是東亞的一部分、無疑的應該站在東亞的國家集團、道方向與路綫、國父早在大亞洲主義裏、指示得明明白白、照這樣做、是東亞同志、不照這樣做是東亞叛逆、這種意義、在和平運動的起頭、就已確定了、一旦大東亞戰爭發生、國民政府立即聲明、與友邦日本同甘共苦、在信念上是一貫的、在行動上是進步的、數年以來、中國雖然彫敝、但是積極的進取精神、是一切的根本、以這樣精神從事組織、從事訓練更從事於物質之創造、目前縱有千辛萬苦、而一日大東亞戰爭勝利、則東亞安全之日、亦即中國解放之時、無論如何辛苦、都値得的、這是每一個中國人都應該有的自覺、還有一層、所謂同甘共苦、不可專在利害着想、尤其要在是否着想、中國是東亞的一部份、東亞若亡於英美之手、中國何能獨存、這是不可否認的、百年以來、英美本想一口呑了東亞、徒以有日本在、不能爲所欲爲、道也是不可否認的、所以今日中國與日本協力、以求大東亞戰爭之勝利、在中國實在是心安理得、無一毫徘徊觀望之餘地、重慶方面、除了少數叛逆無可挽回外、大多數民衆、只要一念及國父大亞洲主義、必然立刻回顧頭來、只愁我們不努力、不愁全面和平不實現、我們和平運動之先驅者、以身作則、必能使全國同胞、終於走向同一方向、及同一路綫、</p>

<p>去年今日是大東亞戰爭開始的日子、日本陸海空軍赫赫的戰果、各位已經知道得淸淸楚楚，用不着我再來說、我們都是有腦筋的人、看到這種戰果、應該明白、這不是偶然的事、日本這種赫赫的戰果、是經過幾許時間的立志、幾許時間的籌備、訓練、然後有今日的成績、同時英美荷之在南洋羣島·珍珠港·馬尼刺等地的敗績、亦不是敗於一刹那之間、亦自有他積漸而來的、</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭已開始一年了、中國現在尚未加入參戰、但是同甘共苦的聲明、中國已經盡力的實踐、中國連年彫敝之餘。物資是這樣的缺乏、有一部分還須友邦日本的供給、但是中國本身的物資、除了留下僅足生存或竟不够生存的小郁分目己使用之外、是應該儘其可能、以供給大東亞戰爭的、</p>

<h3 id="c15">重慶物資缺乏現狀（續）　物資缺乏促成物價高漲　嚴重性不亞於通貨膨脹 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>今日內地物價問題，固與財政金融有密切之關係，然物資不足之因素，亦殊未可忽視。考內地戰時物價狂漲之風，實始於二十九年三月下旬紗價之飛騰，而紗價飛騰之原因，則由於貨缺·在二十九年二月中旬時，渝市存紗不多，同時以運輸阻滯，來貨不易，商人乘機囤積，紗市漸成供不應求之勢。至三月下旬以後，紗貨奇缺，紗價乃抉搖直上。如二十支雙馬牌棉紗在一周之內，上漲約達一千元，自二月至三月之一個月間，約上漲一倍。此爲物價問題嚴重化之開端。</p>
<p>又如二十九年秋，稻穀歉收，而湘贛之米則以運輸困難，未能接濟川省之需要，大糧戶覩此情勢，積不出售，同時更有商人乘機購囤牟利，遂造成糧荒之嚴重局面。自八月至十二月上漲三倍，至翌年七月，共漲達七倍半之譜。於此可見物資不足之因素，對於物價之作用，實驟而急，最足動搖人心。</p>
<p>吾人細察年來渝市物價問題嚴重化之起源與過程，則上舉兩例，要爲共中最顯著之大事。茲冉就日用必需品中之花紗估計其供求概况，以便窺知物資不足程度之一斑。</p>
<p>據聶光堉·朱仙舫之估計，每人每年平均消費布量爲粗布六碼，中等布三碼，細布一碼，共爲十碼。通常布每疋約有四十碼。又按戰前每年動力機織及手工機織布之產量，合計九千五百萬疋，加布貿易入超五十萬疋，共爲九千五百五十萬疋，此爲總供給量，亦即需要量·設全國人口總數爲四萬萬，則每人每年需要布量約爲四分之一疋，亦即十碼，此與聶朱兩氏之估計數相符。令二十四支以下之紗每件可製粗布三十疋；三十二—四十二支紗每件約可製中等布匹十疋；六十—八十支紗每件約可製細布八十疋。按此標準，可由布之需要量求得紗之需要量。又中國紗每件重爲四二〇鎊，即三八一，〇二四市斤，而花紡紗之耗折甚微，則每件紗之紡成，需花三·八市但，故花之需要量可由紗之需要量推求之。</p>
<p>又據人口估計，以川，康，滇，黔，桂，湘，豫，陝，甘，寗，靑，新等十二省爲準，則爲</p>
<p>（一）布之供給量　據估計內地現有動力織布機約四千台，每年最高生產能力可達二百萬疋，俱以空襲被炸或缺少動力等原因，在前數年，約僅實產一·四六·八〇〇疋，再加手工織布實產約九百萬疋，兩共得一〇·一四六·八〇〇疋。惟據某機關之估計，內遷工廠補充設備及增設小型織布機後，云年動力機每月約可產布二八五·四四九疋，全年約可產布三，四二五，三八八疋，如是再加手工織布九百萬疋，則後方動力與手工織布合計每年約可產一二·四二五·三八八疋，上列各家估計，均尚相近。</p>
<p>（二）紗之供給量　二十九年內地動力紗錠開工一〇八·〇〇〇枚，產紗六八·六三二件，此外有「七七」及「三一」等紡紗機三六·〇〇〇架，及手工紡錠五二五·〇〇〇錠，產紗四四〇·〇〇〇件，兩者合計約共爲五〇八·〇〇〇件．又據某機關報告截至去年底止，動力紗錠又增加爲一三一·七〇〇枚，月產九·一四二件，年產一一〇·七〇四件，若再加手工紡紗四四〇·〇〇〇件，共可產五五〇·七〇〇件。但據另一估計，動力紡紗機約可年產七〇·〇〇〇件，手工紡紗約可年產三〇〇·〇〇〇件，兩共約可得三七〇·〇〇〇件，此數與上列估計數略有出入，茲假定前一估計數爲最高產量，後一估計數爲最低產量，似亦屬合理。</p>
<p>（三）棉花之供給量　據渝農本局之估計，內地棉花生產量爲陝豫區一百二十萬担，襄樊區三十萬担，洞庭湖區四十萬担，浙東區四十萬担，川中區五十萬担，共計二百八十萬担。此與中央農業試騐所之估計數亦頗相近。</p>
<p>花紗布之需要與供給量，旣經估計如上，試將各項估計數字，列表比較如次：</p>
<p>據渝經濟部秘書廳之估計，內地人口共有二萬萬人，需要布五千萬疋及軍用布五百寓疋，折合紗一百六十萬件，折合花六百十萬市担。此與上列估計相近。</p>
<p>花紗布之需要量，已得估計數如上。其供給量，則如左列之估計：若以最低需要量與最高供給量相較，則不足之數，布爲一二·五七五·〇〇〇疋，紗爲一五〇·〇〇〇件，花爲二〇〇·〇〇〇市担。</p>
<p>由上表觀之，紗布棉花之供給量，皆不及最低需要量，而其價格在二十九年內約上漲二倍餘，在三十年內約上漲一倍半左右，但花紗布尚非最不足物資之列，故物資不足之於物價上漲，其嚴重性不亞於通貨膨脹，况目前外國物資無從輸入，即用飛機輸入，數量極微，前途之可慮實不堪想像。</p>

<p>工商界動態</p>
<h3 id="c23">上海企業界的先鋒　新亞建業股份有限公司　（續） <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>現在把新亞建業公司目前投資對象的新亞各廠，簡單的加以介紹：（一）新亞化學製藥股份有限公司，簡稱新亞藥廠，創設於民國十五年，由許　羣會計師趙汝調藥師發起創立。最初範圍甚小，僅以製造化妝品及成藥入手，但因經營得法，經過了十多年的時期，範圍益廣，業務日增，現在竟執中國製藥廠之牛耳。國內及南洋各地均有辦事處，華北華西均有分廠。其附屬事業的主要者，有新亞玻璃廠，新亞化學藥物研究所，新亞生物硏究所，廣澄藥學專科學校，冠羣業餘補習學校，新亞圖書館，新亞出版刊物，如英文醫學雜誌，新醫藥刊，國藥新聲，健康家庭。（二）新亞衛生材料廠股份有限公司，專製新亞橡皮膏，行銷普及國內外。創於民國二十六年，至民國三十年，因是年營業達百三十餘萬元，超過原有資本四倍，乃增資至國幣一百二十萬元，增加生產，充實原料。（三）新亞血淸廠股份有限公司，創於民國二十七年，初創時資本爲國幣三十萬元，聽說不久要增資釗二百萬元。製造方面，計分預防製造部，治療製品部，血淸部。（四）新亞酵素　業股份有限公司，創於民國三十年，額定股本國幣一百萬元，到了三十一年，增資爲國幣三百萬元，從事擴大生產。現在所產酵母，業已推銷全市，以應戶口麵粉發酵之需求。（五）新亞科學股份有限公司，創於民國三十年，資本爲國幣一百萬元，製品爲各種印件，各種紙盒，敎育用品，文具儀器等，（六）香港新亞化學製藥股份有限公司，簡稱香港新亞藥廠爲上海新亞藥廠聯合香港華僑於民國二十八年所設立的，當時的資本爲港幣五十萬元，自建廠屋於九龍，利用熱帶所產原料製成藥品，推銷南洋一帶。</p>
<p>上面所說的新亞各廠，便是新亞各廠，便是新亞建業公司現在投資的對象。至於未來投資的對象，概括的說，就是去推淮新典的工商事業，並且爲應付今日工商界所遭遇的新環境，所發生的新問題，是要把物資方法精神力量整個的放在一起，來發展一般和社會日常需要有關係的事業，工業也好，商業也好。總而言之，是以救濟目前民營事業之困難，綢繆戰後民營事業之建設爲其理想的—並且由理想的而至於實現的—一個對象。</p>
<p>三·新亞建業在組織與人才方面：</p>
<p>新亞建業公司在組織上，可以說是簡單化，它的股東會董事會以及監察人而外，其內部的機構，是絕對採取車質不重量的原則。絕對不因襲因人設事的習慣。所以該公司就以董事畏兼任總經理，而總經理之下，並無副總經理，經理，協理，副經理，襄理一類的名稱，其下祗有業務，總務，稽核，設計四處，每處的下面，分科辦事；業務處轄營業，服務，保管，統計叫科；總務處轄文書，庶務，人事，股務四科；稽核處轄審核，會計，出納三科；設計處轄設計，硏究，編撰三科，此外總經理之左右，有一個顧問專員室，專備諮詢。</p>
<p>在問幕的那一天，有一位來賓說過這樣一句話：「新亞建業的資本，固然是號　一千萬元，却是新亞建業的人才，恐怕不是這一千萬元所能够羅致得到的。」質言之，它的內部人才，可以够得上說是應有盡有。如董事長許冠羣，常務董事朱博泉，邱良榮，董事趙汝調，顧克民，會廣方，傳湘丞，朱如堂，徐謝康，吳蘊齋，葉扶霄，許寶驊，施作謀，監察人李伯涵，許靖之，史　權，程慕，曹畤玉，都是上海工商界，實業界，金融界的有數人物；如總務處長張國華，糟核處長于稻蓀，業務處長李惕生，設計處長劉雲舫，都爲富有經騐的專門人才，眞可以說是人才會萃了。</p>
<p>憑着上面的叙述，大概可以把新近開幕的新亞建業股份有限公司作一鳥瞰、我們處於今日工商業環境中的人們，對於這一個有主義，有實力，有組　。有人才的投資組織，當然是懷抱着無限的期望，湧現着滿腔的熱誠。</p>

<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>（七）菲列賓之戰</p>
<p>十二月八日，日本陸海軍航空部隊急襲菲律賓的美方航空隊及主要飛機塲。使美國準備攻擊日本本土的空軍實力，遭受致命的打擊。十日晨前開始對呂宋島北岸阿帕里方面及西北海岸方面敵前登陸，在美國的遠東領土上升起日本旗幟，日方稱之爲無血登陸。」十二日，日軍又在呂宋島東南端蘭加士丕附近登陸二十日晨佔領明他拿亞島，此島在菲律賓爲僅次於呂宋的大島。從此，菲律賓的防綫已被衝破。</p>
<p>二十二日，日本主力在馬尼拉北方二百公里的呂宋島西岸林家恩　登陸，二十四至二十七』，其他各地相繼登陸，對馬尼拉包圍進攻。到了今年元旦日軍就已完全佔領菲島的首都馬尼拉。到了五月上旬日軍已將菲律賓全部控制了。</p>
<p>（八）婆羅洲之戰</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭第一週強襲夏威夷新加坡和馬尼拉英美的三大軍事據點，覆滅其海空中勢力。至第二週，戰局中心移至南中國海—日本對英美作戰的主要戰塲。原來北面的香港，東面的菲律賓羣島，西面的馬來半島，南面的英領婆羅洲，其中香港，馬尼拉和新加坡為英美構成遠東的戰略三角區，爲進攻日本的主要根據地。日軍於開戰第一日首攻香港，第三日至第五日在菲律賓的呂宋島南北兩端登陸，接着越南和泰國又於十一日與日軍成立軍事協定和攻守同盟，於是南中國海上英美的對日包圍陳錢已被各個突破了。唯一的根據地，只有婆羅洲了。婆羅洲是世界第二大島，英屬佔全島的七分之二，北部海岸爲石油產地。日軍於十二月十六日在婆羅洲登陸，與香港馬來亞和菲律賓互相呼應，控制了整個的南中國海。</p>
<p>在婆羅洲，米里，羅敦，塞利亞三地登陸的日軍，經過一個月的血戰，至二月四日，英領婆羅洲便完全戡定。從此以後，南中國海上北自香港，南至婆羅洲，東至菲律賓，都爲日軍所佔領；於是，便可加强對馬來亞尤其是對新加坡的總攻了。</p>
<p>（九）新加坡之私</p>
<p>日軍精銳在山下司令官統率下，於十二月八日，開始向馬來半島登陸，占領司令太巴爾飛機場。到了十七日，占領檳榔嶼。一月三日淮占新加波以北二百八十公里的重要航空根據地克阿恩泰，使新加坡陷爲日本戰鬥機的活動目標。</p>
<p>檳榔嶼攻略的主力部隊於得勝後，續向班拉克洲進攻。二十三日，占領世界第一錫產地泰依濱。二十三日渡過班拉河，二十八日進攻班拉克首都怡保，獲行了對新加坡直接威脅的航空根據地。今年一月十六日就深入柔佛州中部的克爾阿恩了。接着於一月三十一日攻陷柔佛巴哈爾。自十二月八日至此五十五日之間，日軍推進到一千一百公里，開戰史空前的迅速的先例。</p>
<p>於是，新加坡要塞的攻略戰開始了。</p>
<p>新加坡，這個英帝國侵略東亞的軍事根據點，會以四萬萬元的國防費，悠長的時日，慘淡建設，與地中海西口的直布羅陀，稱爲世界二大要塞。但是終於遭到日軍無情的攻擊了。一月三十一日、日軍開始强渡柔佛水道。二月七日夜在新加坡東北的烏濱島登陸，牽制敵軍。二月八日夜間始對新加坡總攻，吻日下午七時占領了頓加機塲。十一日奪取布克台麥山，新加坡市街已在指呼之間了。十四日晨開始對新加坡市街作戰；十五日下午，就最後佔領新加坡，在大東亞戰爭史上永留了驚人的一頁。</p>
<p>新加坡之佔領，具有決定東亞命運的重要意義。從軍事方面說，第一南中國海上英美對日包圍陳綫完全消滅了，英美再也不能在西南太平洋實行聯合哩綫了。第二，從此以後日軍不僅成爲南中國海的主人，而日也要進而解決與英美聯合　日的荷印的命運了。第三，日軍佔領馬來新加坡以後，已可進而控制印度洋，而展開了日軍更遠大的前途。</p>
<p>從政治方面說，新加坡是英美聯合反抗日本的大本營。日本佔領了新加坡，不僅引起了英美本國人民對於英美在太平洋作戰力的懷疑，而且預先給荷印以莫大的打擊，荷印的士氣也因此大受挫喪。此外東亞各小國和一向在英美荷帝國主義者壓迫之下的小民族，過去百餘年對英美人的崇拜或畏懼，變而突然加強了亞洲民族的自信心。這佔大東亞民族的自覺上，是有極重大的意義。</p>
<p>（十）東印度諸島之戰</p>
<p>荷屬東印度，是荷蘭帝國主義者生命所在，在大東亞戰爭前夕，是ABCD陣綫中主要的一環。因此，當日軍攻陷了新加坡之後，立刻展開了對荷屬東印度的總攻勢。</p>
<p>首先，日軍於一月十一日在荷屬婆羅洲東海岸的泰拉肯登陸，二十四日進攻婆羅洲東海岸的要　巴里八板，二十五日完全佔領該市。這是南太平洋的要　，佔領後，日軍就可控制馬卡撤與海峽，無異對荷印之心臟部斯拉把亞挿進了鋒利的匕首。一月，十七日，進而勘定了西部婆羅洲，至三月中旬，荷領婆羅洲已經全部佔領了。</p>
<p>其次，日軍在一月二十六日佔領異　羣島中的塞關勃斯島，控制了馬卡撤爾海峽，形成對荷印和澳大利亞的一大威脅。南部蘇門答臘的進攻，開始於二月六日。十一日先把敵方的空軍力量擊潰了。不出旬日，日軍已經勘定了蘇門答臘的南部主要地區，而爪哇也就完全在日軍的威脅之下了。</p>
<p>其後，經過了爪哇的海戰，日本海空軍又獲得了空前的勝利。當新加坡陷落之後，荷屬爪哇便陷於孤立了。三月一日，日本陸軍部隊在海軍掩獲之下，在爪哇東部，中部，西部強行登陸，立刻獲得重大的成功，西南太平洋聯軍司令部事實上已經瓦解。到了三月五日，荷印的首都巴達維亞已經飛揚起日本旗了。戰事向東部方面移動，三月八日荷印總督和聯軍長官低頭下氣地向日軍投降了。</p>
<p>從　以後，英美荷在西南太平洋的反攻根據地已經完全消滅，西部方面，日本軍隊已經面對着印度洋了，東部面已經把澳大利亞孤立起來了。</p>
<p>（十一）緬甸之戰</p>
<p>當日軍在西南太平洋上縱橫騁所向披靡的時候，聯合國方面於敗北之中，企圖從另一方面來牽制日軍，這裏主要的是第一加強助重慶，在華中華南和華北各綫展開反攻。第二實現英美重慶的軍事合作，加强緬甸的保衛戰，進而向越南泰國進兵，以圖分散日本的兵力。在這兩種策動中，緬甸是有着非常重要的戰略上和攻略上的意義的，可能給日本以重大的威脅。於是，日本開始對緬甸的攻略戰。</p>
<p>首先，在空軍方面，日軍早於十二月十三日大舉空　緬甸各空軍根據地。以後，日本空軍就不斷在緬甸各地活動，主要目的是粉碎央美在緬甸軍建空軍。</p>
<p>當日軍進攻馬來半島的時候，日本陸軍早在一月十七日首先占領了克拉　峽要衝緬甸所屬的太伏伊附近的重要陣地，以阻緬甸方面對馬來的增援部隊。一月二十日，日空軍大轟炸緬甸第三都市莫爾孟，協助陸軍進攻莫爾孟平原。三十一日佔領莫爾孟市。於是緬甸以東的敵軍全爲日方肅淸，而援渝路綫也完全陷入日軍轟炸圈內；同時，緬甸首都仰光也就孤立了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">"Transfer Sincere Enthusiasm to Words and Deeds" <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>——Reflections on Reading Chief of Staff Kawabe's "Address to Japanese Soldiers in China" and Briefly Stating the Attitude of Our Country's Citizens——</p>
<p>On the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, General Staff Kawabe Masakazu of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China issued the "Address to Japanese Soldiers in China." After reading it repeatedly, in addition to expressing sincere admiration for Kawabe's "correct vision regarding the completion of the Greater East Asia War and the resolution of Sino-Japanese relations" and his spirit of treating the Chinese people with sincerity and encouraging Japanese soldiers, I feel that there are still many thoughts that must be stated from the standpoint of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>First, regarding the attitude of the Japanese soldiers in China, Kawabe emphasized (1) establishing strict military discipline; (2) practicing "sincerity"; and (3) respecting the traditional customs of the Chinese people. As for military discipline, the Japanese army has always been known to the world for its strictness. Moreover, the Japanese soldiers are all educated youths who, in peacetime, are law-abiding citizens or soldiers accustomed to military discipline through strict military training. Therefore, China has no reason to doubt the "strict military discipline." However, China's social environment is complex. Local bullies, gentry, and ignorant speculators will inevitably use various temptations and abuse their authority to do as they please, directly or indirectly affecting military discipline. This cannot but be taken with extra vigilance.</p>
<p>Secondly, speaking of "sincerity," the Japanese authorities have made repeated declarations over the past five years, and various parties in our country have responded with correct understanding. But as Kawabe said, "The Chongqing side remains obstinately unaware and continues to resist, because they are still seeking to trust Japan's sincerity." We must also add that the problem is not whether the Chongqing authorities trust Japan's sincerity, but whether the Chinese people have a correct understanding of Japan's sincerity. Chinese philosophy emphasizes the word "sincerity," and the Chinese people generally use the word "sincerity" to measure the friendly relationship between people, and even extend it to the relationship between people and gods, such as "sincerity brings efficacy," "sincerity can communicate with gods," and "where sincerity and determination penetrate, metal and stone will yield." These are the conclusions of Chinese life philosophy and folk philosophy over thousands of years. Historically, any ruler who treated the people with "sincerity" was loved by the people. Now the Japanese army is in China to "liberate China, free it from the oppression of Britain and the United States, help it achieve independence, and establish eternal good neighborly relations (see Kawabe's original text)." This has long been understood by a part of the Chinese intellectual class. However, the current problem is not the understanding and trust of a small number of Chinese government authorities and a part of the intellectuals, but the thorough understanding and trust of the common people, which can help the good neighborly relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>Again, Kawabe's special mention of "respecting the traditional customs of the Chinese people" is particularly insightful and important. The situation is often like this: the Chinese people sincerely trust the Japanese army's military discipline, and they also have a considerable understanding of the Japanese army's "sincerity." However, due to the differences between the traditional customs of the Chinese and Japanese people, the efforts of the aforementioned two are often negatively affected. Moreover, because of the gap between the two sides, the gap between the temperament of Japanese soldiers and the unique straightforward attitude of the Chinese people can often cause great misunderstandings due to small problems. On the one hand, it is necessary to step up the communication between the cultures of the two countries, not only to promote Japanese language and culture in China, but also for Japanese soldiers and civilians to study Chinese language, writing, history, social conditions, customs, and so on. On the other hand, it is also necessary to strengthen the psychology of "self-restraint" and the emotion of "mutual understanding," and to use "sincerity" to supplement strict military discipline. We must recognize that in this era of the Greater East Asia War, the areas where China and Japan need to cooperate must be very urgent, so both sides must immediately work to achieve this.</p>
<p>Secondly, Kawabe's words in "Sino-Japanese friendship begins with the expeditionary force" and "Always think of the battlefield in front and the hardships in the rear" are addressed to the Japanese soldiers, but the depth of the feelings of the Chinese people after reading them must not be less than those of the Japanese soldiers. There is no need to hide that, except for a very few outstanding figures, most Chinese people do not have academic research on politics, lack the ability to observe and have long-term vision, and they only rely on their intuition. They do not have a true understanding of the Japanese soldiers coming to China to fight, but they have a psychology passed down from generation to generation, that is, whoever comes and benefits them more, they will support and respect. Similarly, the Chinese people are not without the spirit of sacrifice, but there must be a kind of power or method to make them realize that this sacrifice is for their honor and benefit. The complicated factors of politics cannot be understood by them, and their political understanding is so simple, but this is what is worth noting and researching in the current work of strengthening Sino-Japanese cooperation.</p>
<p>After reading Kawabe's article, we dare to offer two further suggestions: first, a strict selection system must be adopted for Chinese staff or translators who assist the Japanese army. Especially: (1) Before being hired, they must go through a considerable period—at least six months or a year—to have a full and thorough understanding of Japan's true intentions toward China and the mission of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, and a full and practical understanding of the attitude, methods, and techniques of the work; (2) After being hired, various appropriate occasions and methods should still be used to continue training, so that they have higher attainments, and focus on the cultivation of character and the encouragement of integrity, so that they can make a good impression on the Chinese people; (3) A necessary system of assessment, rewards, and punishments must be established for his work, knowledge, ability, and especially his character and behavior, and this system must be more serious than the average. Only under this system and method can we avoid using people carelessly and harming the reputation of the Japanese army, and further increase the degree of Sino-Japanese cooperation because of being good at using people. Secondly, standing from the position of the Chinese people, we sincerely hope that the lower-ranking soldiers and related staff of the Japanese Expeditionary Force will be strengthened in political training, and often lectured on Chinese language, writing, history, customs, habits, and social organization, etc., so that they have a considerable understanding of all aspects. When contacting the Chinese people, they can avoid unnecessary misunderstandings, avoid fraud by interpreters and indirect contacts, and directly help Sino-Japanese cooperation and produce greater effects.</p>
<p>At the same time, because of Kawabe's article, we are more concerned about studying the attitude that the Chinese people should have toward the Japanese Expeditionary Force and friendly foreign nationals. First of all, we naturally need to have a more complete and thorough understanding and trust of Japan's policy toward China, the mission of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, and the mutual relations between the Chinese and Japanese people. This kind of understanding and trust must not be limited to slogans, slogans, speeches, and writing, but must be expressed in practical actions, just as we hope from the Japanese side. However, the education and organization of our country's ordinary people are not very perfect, so we hope that the authorities responsible for this aspect pay special attention to this. What is especially important is not the instillation-style and compulsory work, but the inspiration of the people's automatic requirements and the development of their initiative. Secondly, the people of our country should also have an attitude of neither being humble nor arrogant, like brothers, toward the soldiers of friendly countries and foreign nationals. Not being humble is the proper attitude of the East Asian nations who are rising up and becoming independent after the Greater East Asia War, and it is also the basis for the equal cooperation between the people of the two countries. Not being arrogant is a necessary condition for Sino-Japanese mutual understanding, mutual assistance, and mutual progress. Only by being neither humble nor arrogant can we be like brothers, cooperate, and strive for a bright future. Of course, it is not enough to just achieve this, so we should also treat each other with sincerity. Confucius said: "Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself." This is what we expect from the Japanese side toward us, and we should do even more so to the Japanese side, especially in taking the lead in doing it, which is the manifestation of the word "sincerity." The foundation of the Chinese people's philosophy lies in the word "sincerity," and we must first set an example for others to see. And being sincere to Japan means using the spirit of sacrifice of sharing hardships today to seek common happiness in the future, that is, to be prepared for greater sacrifices, infinite sacrifices, to cooperate with Japan and jointly strive for the common victory of the two countries—that is, the victory of the Greater East Asia War—and the liberation of the East Asian nations.</p>
<p>Finally, we want to conclude with the "topic," "Transfer sincere enthusiasm to words and deeds." Both China and Japan should pay attention to avoiding any words or deeds that damage the feelings of the other party in the future, because a thousand articles of friendship and ten thousand slogans of cooperation are often greatly reduced in their effectiveness of friendship and cooperation by a hand or a foot that damages the feelings of the other party—this is what we sincerely expect from the efforts of both sides. Because sincerity, as Kawabe pointed out, is that "if the Sino-Japanese Incident cannot be completely resolved, then the Greater East Asia War will be difficult to achieve complete victory." And the complete resolution of the Sino-Japanese Incident lies in both forces "transferring sincere enthusiasm to words and deeds"!</p>
<h3 id="e2">Greater East Asia War Anniversary: Japan Commemorates Solemnly Nationwide; Prime Minister Tojo Delivers Speech, Resolving to Strive for Final Victory <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) The Greater East Asia War has reached its one-year anniversary. The resolution of Japan, both government and people, to complete the war and strive for final victory is becoming increasingly firm. On this anniversary, grand and solemn commemoration ceremonies are held throughout Japan. At 11:59 a.m. on the 8th, all transportation agencies and workers across the country stopped working for one minute to pray silently for the war dead and wish the soldiers on expedition a long and prosperous military career. Prime Minister Tojo solemnly read the declaration of war and rebroadcast the speech he gave last year when he paid homage to the declaration of war. Various agencies, groups, and schools also held ceremonies to read the declaration of war separately. At 2:00 p.m., a national assembly was convened across the country, with the central assembly held in front of the Yasukuni Shrine. Each unit in the prefectures and counties also held meetings separately and rebroadcast Prime Minister Tojo's speech at the central assembly. At 1:00 p.m., a grand military music concert was held at the Hibiya Public Hall in Tokyo, and at 6:00 p.m., a commemorative lecture meeting was held there, with lectures by Mayor Kishimoto of Tokyo, Section Chief Hirade of the Navy Press Department of the General Headquarters, and Director-General Tani of the Army Press Department of the General Headquarters. From dawn to dusk, crowds and representatives of groups flocked to the Nijubashi Bridge to pay respects to the Imperial Palace, praying for the Emperor's long life. The emotions were extremely enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) The National Assembly for the Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, organized by the Great Japan Imperial Rule Assistance Association, etc., was convened separately in various parts of the country at 2:00 p.m. on the 8th. The central assembly in Tokyo was held at the Yasukuni Shrine. Prime Minister Tojo attended in person and delivered a speech, which was broadcast to various assemblies via radio. The gist of his speech is as follows: Fellow citizens, today last year was the day when we respectfully received the declaration of war against Britain and the United States. Recalling a year ago, the Empire, in order to maintain world peace and prevent human tragedy, showed the greatest restraint and self-respect, but finally rose up today a year ago. The one hundred million citizens of the Empire believed that the rise and fall of the Empire depended on this battle, and from that day on, with the belief that they would surely win, they vowed to devote all their strength to repay the country. On this day of profound significance, at the Yasukuni Shrine, where the spirits of those who have protected the country are enshrined, the National Assembly for the Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War is convened, and I would like to express my thoughts, which are truly filled with infinite emotion. Looking back at this year, all one hundred million of our compatriots have respectfully observed the imperial edict and devoted all their efforts to fighting bravely. At the beginning of the war, the Imperial Army severely damaged the main forces of the British and American fleets in Hawaii and Malaya respectively. At the same time, the army and navy, through skillful joint operations, successively captured Hong Kong, the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, and Burma. Wherever the military went, the enemy was defeated and demoralized. The power of the Imperial Army has spread throughout the Greater East Asia region. Our people in the rear have also cooperated and overcome the hardships of wartime life, and each has devoted all their efforts to serving the public in their respective positions. The construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere has also been vigorously promoted at the same time as the progress of the war. Not to mention Hong Kong and Malaya, even Burma, the Dutch East Indies, and the Philippines have been freed from the shackles of Britain and the United States. The local residents are deeply grateful for the Emperor's grace and are happy to cooperate, so the construction project is progressing steadily and has achieved great results. In the past year, the Empire has established a solid foundation for victory in both strategic and economic terms, and has continued to expand and strengthen it. We will be able to fight again and win again until Britain and the United States surrender. Furthermore, the cooperation between Germany, Italy, and other European allies and the Empire has become closer since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. As a result of fighting bravely in various aspects, they have also repeatedly achieved victories, and are responding to and advancing with the Empire in defeating the forces of Britain and the United States. At the same time, in the Greater East Asia region, Manchuria has devoted all its national strength to cooperating in the war, and the Nationalist Government of China is also cooperating with the Empire with the determination to share weal and woe in coping with the difficult situation. Thailand took appropriate measures at the beginning of the war, and later signed a defensive alliance with the Empire, exerting all its strength to cooperate in the war. Therefore, with the mutual support between the East and the West, and the unity of the various countries and nations in the Greater East Asia, the unprecedented war to defeat the common enemy, Britain and the United States, has entered a true stage. With the great achievements of the Empire in the past year, coupled with the concerted efforts of the allied nations, we are even more confident that we will be able to defeat the offensive of Britain and the United States. I still remember that before the war, the South Seas, which have countless important resources, were the treasure trove of Britain and the United States, but less than half a year after the outbreak of the war, they were liberated from oppression. These regions have now recovered their original appearance and have become the foundation of great war power to protect East Asia. The enemy has lost these abundant war resources, while East Asia has added countless treasures. But if we can make the greatest and best use of these resources to provide for the soldiers on the front lines to be active and successful, then it all depends on the shoulders of you, my fellow citizens. Therefore, the responsibility of our one hundred million citizens is by no means easy. Today's battlefield is no longer limited to the front lines, so it is no exaggeration to say that every move in your daily life will immediately affect the combat effectiveness of the front lines. Therefore, your factories are supply factories for the front lines to win victory, and your farms are the logistics departments for one hundred million citizens to win victory. In short, all of your duties, no matter how small, are battlefields for winning victory. There is also a saying that since ancient times, war has been a war of wills, so only those who can fight stubbornly to the last five minutes can win the glory of victory. Although the Empire has encountered many difficulties, the acquisition of resources in the South Seas is as described above. The weapon of economic blockade that the United States relied on to oppress us before the war has now been used by us. It is not difficult to know the extent of the difficulties faced by the enemy. Therefore, although we and the enemy are both fighting against the greatest difficulties today, the difference is that the enemy has fallen into the abyss of despair and is facing more and more difficulties, while we are growing out of the experience of pain with a bright future. As I have repeatedly stated in the past, this war is followed by a decisive battle after a huge consumption, so the first requirement for winning victory is to first win the current decisive battle. Moreover, we must win this war. If we cannot win, then the construction of the Greater East Asia, which the one billion people of East Asia have been looking forward to for a hundred years, will disappear completely like a beautiful dream. This cannot be answered to the spirits of the Yasukuni Shrine. Therefore, no matter what, we must overcome all difficulties, remove all obstacles, and break through the difficult situation in order to win the complete victory of this war. Now is not the time to issue empty arguments and make random criticisms. All the people of the country must devote all their intelligence, do their best, stick to their posts, and work hard. My personal will to devote myself to repaying the country has been decided. I will first serve the country for my fellow citizens and reassure the Emperor. Today is the anniversary of the war. I would like to express my gratitude to the allied nations for their great cooperation with the Empire, and I deeply hope that we will continue to cooperate closely, support each other, and achieve the common goal of striving for final victory.</p>

<h3 id="e3">Capital Citizens' Asia Development Conference; Chairman Wang Attends in Person to Deliver Instructions; Cooperate in the Greater East Asia War; Realize Pan-Asianism <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) Today (the 8th) is the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. To express their enthusiastic celebration, the citizens of the capital hung flags throughout the city to mark the occasion and held the Capital Citizens' Asia Development Conference for the Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War at the National Assembly Hall at 9:30 a.m. The National Government attended in person to deliver instructions. At 9:30 a.m., the meeting was declared open to the sound of the national anthems of China and Japan, and the most respectful salutes were paid to the national flags of China and Japan. The audience respectfully listened to the Chairman's instructions, and all the citizens in the audience were extremely moved after hearing them. The ceremony ended at about 11:00 a.m.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) Yesterday (8th), Chairman Wang, for the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, following up on the "Letter to the People of the Whole Country" issued on November 30 for the second anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Treaty, issued another "Letter to the People of the Whole Country," elaborating on the significance of cooperating in the Greater East Asia War and sharing weal and woe. In the morning, the Chairman attended the Capital Citizens' Asia Development Conference in person. First, he explained this meaning, and then made an important extension, pointing out that moving from the peace movement to cooperating in the Greater East Asia War is both progressive and consistent. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Moving from the peace movement to cooperating in the Greater East Asia War, this meaning is progressive, and it is consistent. The true meaning of the peace movement is to return to Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism. Originally, Pan-Asianism was the backbone of the Chinese National Revolution. Although we had this ideal before, we did not get the opportunity to realize it. When the friendly nation of Japan advocated the construction of a new order in East Asia, based on the spirit of Eastern morality, in order to seek the coexistence and co-prosperity of China and Japan, then the opportunity to realize Pan-Asianism has arrived. Therefore, Chinese people of insight immediately abandoned the concept of resistance and engaged in the peace movement. This is not a change, but a return to the original face of the National Revolution. From then on, we recognized that reviving China and reviving East Asia are one thing, not two things. This kind of understanding, especially in the training of the general public, or in the training of the army, navy, and air force, should be a common and profound belief. Some people used to misunderstand peace, thinking that peace is to rest with the people. These misunderstandings are due to not knowing that in today's survival competition, only active progress, not passive retreat, can help. Some people also think that peace is to restore national vitality and cultivate the strength for the people to regenerate. This is only a one-sided view, because progress must have the correct direction and route. If we do not, we will not only be unable to benefit the country, but will also be enough to bring disaster. Today's survival competition is not just a competition between countries, but a competition between country groups. This kind of competition is a total war of the people. After having the spirit of active progress, we must use this spirit in a certain country group, with one mind and unwavering ambition. Only in this way can we win in the competition. Which country group should China stand on? China is a part of East Asia, and undoubtedly should stand on the East Asian country group. The direction and route were clearly indicated by the Father of the Nation in Pan-Asianism. Doing this is being an East Asian comrade, and not doing this is being an East Asian traitor. This meaning was determined at the beginning of the peace movement. Once the Greater East Asia War broke out, the National Government immediately declared that it would share weal and woe with the friendly nation of Japan. It is consistent in belief and progressive in action. Although China has been devastated for several years, the spirit of active progress is the foundation of everything. Engaging in organization, training, and even the creation of materials with this spirit, even if there are thousands of hardships and difficulties at present, once the Greater East Asia War is victorious, the day of East Asia's safety will also be the time of China's liberation. No matter how hard it is, it is worth it. This is a self-awareness that every Chinese person should have. There is another level, the so-called sharing weal and woe, we cannot only think about the gains and losses, especially we must think about what is right and wrong. China is a part of East Asia. If East Asia is to be destroyed by Britain and the United States, how can China survive alone? This is undeniable. For a hundred years, Britain and the United States have wanted to swallow East Asia in one gulp, but they have not been able to do what they wanted because Japan is there. This is also undeniable. Therefore, today, China and Japan are cooperating to seek the victory of the Greater East Asia War, which is truly at ease in China, without any hesitation or hesitation. Except for a few incorrigible traitors in Chongqing, the majority of the people, as long as they think of the Father of the Nation's Pan-Asianism, will definitely look back immediately. We only worry that we are not working hard enough, and we do not worry that overall peace will not be realized. Our pioneers of the peace movement, by setting an example, will surely enable our compatriots throughout the country to eventually move in the same direction and on the same route.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Greater East Asia War Anniversary: Commemoration Meetings Held in Various Places; Central Committee Member Chen Bichen Delivers Speech in Guangzhou <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 8th (Central News Agency) Fourteen thousand Japanese residents here held a commemoration meeting at the Guangdong Shrine at 8:00 a.m. to commemorate the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. On the Chinese side, the Asia Development People's Congress was held at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall starting at 10:00 a.m. Representatives of various circles and students then paraded through the city. In the afternoon, a recreational gathering to comfort the Japanese army and street propaganda were also held. Guangzhou, 8th (Central News Agency) Central Committee Member Chen Bichen attended the Guangdong Asia Development Congress on the 8th and delivered a speech, which roughly said:</p>
<p>Today last year was the day when the Greater East Asia War began. You all already know clearly about the brilliant results of the Japanese army, navy, and air force, so there is no need for me to say it again. We are all people with brains, and seeing these results, we should understand that this is not a coincidence. Japan's brilliant results are the result of aspirations, preparations, and training over a period of time, and then there is today's achievement. At the same time, the defeats of Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands in the South Seas Islands, Pearl Harbor, and Manila were not defeated in an instant, but were accumulated over time.</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War has been going on for a year now. China has not yet joined the war, but China has tried its best to fulfill its statement of sharing weal and woe. After years of devastation in China, material resources are so scarce that some of them must be supplied by the friendly nation of Japan. However, the material resources of China itself, except for the small portion that is barely enough for survival or not even enough for survival, should be supplied to the Greater East Asia War as much as possible.</p>
<p>Beijing, 8th (Central News Agency) 400,000 Japanese residents in various parts of North China took today as the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, and prayed silently at noon, praying for the long-lasting military fortune of the wounded and soldiers on expedition, and thanking the military power of the spirits protecting the country. In addition, the people of China and Japan held a Greater East Asia War anniversary meeting at the Huai Ren Tang Hall, and issued a joint declaration to move towards the second year of the war with perseverance, solidarity, and the belief in victory. Tonight, the Sino-Japanese Baojia (community watch) groups convened a friendship meeting to discuss the issue of life reform and determined to practice the construction of North China.</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Beijing Dispatch: Lü Ronghuan, the Ambassador of Manchukuo to China, made the following remarks on the occasion of the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War: "Looking back on this day one year ago, the Japanese army launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii and advanced into the Malay Peninsula, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Borneo, and Burma, one after another. All of the important strategic strongholds of Britain and the United States were destroyed. Recently, fierce battles have been fought repeatedly in the southwestern Pacific, repelling the enemy's counter-offensive forces, and the only line of communication between Britain, the United States, and Australia has been severed. At present, the Japanese army, from the Aleutian Islands in the north to the Solomon Islands in the south, is securing a vast front line, as solid as a rock, and completely controls the sea power in the Pacific Ocean. On the mainland, it has inflicted heavy blows on Chongqing for five years, cutting off its supply lines. At the same time, our Manchukuo is responsible for defending the northern border and completing the mission of a major supply base, so that Japan has no worries about the rear. Together with the Republic of China, Vietnam, Thailand, and Burma, we form a solid formation. From this point of view, whether in the Pacific or on the mainland, Japan's strategic position has already gained an invincible position. In particular, Japan's great plan for the revival of East Asia has been gradually realized in the occupied territories in the south, and the various ethnic groups in the south are thoroughly awakened, helping each other and cooperating to build a bright and hopeful future for the Greater East Asia."</p>

<h3 id="e15">Current Shortage of Supplies in Chongqing (Continued): Shortage of Supplies Promotes High Prices; Severity No Less Than Currency Inflation <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Today, the issue of domestic prices is closely related to fiscal finance. However, the factor of insufficient supplies should not be ignored. The domestic wartime price surge began in late March 1940 with the soaring price of yarn. The reason for the soaring price of yarn was due to the shortage of goods. In mid-February 1940, there was not much yarn in stock in the Chongqing market. At the same time, due to transportation obstacles, it was difficult to receive goods, and merchants took the opportunity to hoard, gradually creating a situation where the supply of yarn could not meet the demand. After late March, yarn was extremely scarce, and the price of yarn skyrocketed. For example, the price of 20-count Double Horse brand cotton yarn rose by about 1,000 yuan in one week, and about doubled in one month from February to March. This was the beginning of the serious price problem.</p>
<p>For example, in the autumn of 1940, the rice harvest was poor, and rice from Hunan and Jiangxi could not meet the needs of Sichuan Province due to transportation difficulties. Large grain merchants saw this situation and refused to sell, while some merchants took the opportunity to purchase and hoard for profit, resulting in a severe grain shortage. The price rose threefold from August to December, and a total of seven and a half times by July of the following year. From this, it can be seen that the factor of insufficient supplies has a sudden and rapid effect on prices, which is most likely to shake people's hearts.</p>
<p>If we carefully observe the origin and process of the serious price problem in Chongqing in recent years, the above two examples are the most significant events. Now, let's estimate the supply and demand situation of daily necessities such as cotton yarn in order to get a glimpse of the degree of insufficient supplies.</p>
<p>According to the estimates of Nie Guangyu and Zhu Xianfang, the average annual consumption of cloth per person is 6 yards of coarse cloth, 3 yards of medium cloth, and 1 yard of fine cloth, totaling 10 yards. Usually, each bolt of cloth has about 40 yards. According to the pre-war annual output of power-loom woven and hand-loom woven cloth, the total is 95 million bolts, plus a cloth trade surplus of 500,000 bolts, totaling 95.5 million bolts, which is the total supply, that is, the amount needed. If the total population of the country is 400 million, then the amount of cloth needed per person per year is about one-quarter of a bolt, that is, 10 yards, which is consistent with the estimates of Nie and Zhu. Now, each bale of yarn of 24 counts or less can produce 30 bolts of coarse cloth; each bale of yarn of 32-42 counts can produce about 10 bolts of medium cloth; each bale of yarn of 60-80 counts can produce about 8 bolts of fine cloth. According to this standard, the amount of yarn needed can be obtained from the amount of cloth needed. Each bale of Chinese yarn weighs 420 pounds, or 381.024 catties, and the consumption of cotton spinning is very small, so the spinning of each bale of yarn requires 3.8 catties of cotton, so the amount of cotton needed can be deduced from the amount of yarn needed.</p>
<p>According to population estimates, taking the twelve provinces of Sichuan, Kang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Hunan, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang as the standard, then:</p>
<p>(1) Supply of Cloth: According to estimates, there are currently about 4,000 power looms in the interior, and the maximum annual production capacity can reach 2 million bolts. Due to air raids, bombing, or lack of power, only about 1,468,000 bolts were actually produced in the previous few years, plus about 9 million bolts actually produced by hand looms, totaling 10,146,800 bolts. However, according to the estimate of a certain organization, after the relocated factories supplemented equipment and added small weaving machines, it is said that the annual power loom production can reach about 285,449 bolts per month, and about 3,425,388 bolts per year. If 9 million bolts of hand-loom woven cloth are added, the total annual production of power and hand-loom woven cloth in the rear area can reach about 12,425,388 bolts. The above estimates are all similar.</p>
<p>(2) Supply of Yarn: In 1940, 108,000 power yarn spindles were put into operation in the interior, producing 68,632 bales of yarn. In addition, there were 36,000 "July 7th" and "January 28th" spinning machines, and 525,000 hand-spinning spindles, producing 440,000 bales of yarn, totaling about 508,000 bales. According to a report from a certain organization, as of the end of last year, the number of power yarn spindles had increased to 131,700, with a monthly output of 9,142 bales and an annual output of 110,704 bales. If 440,000 bales of hand-spun yarn are added, a total of 550,700 bales can be produced. However, according to another estimate, power spinning machines can produce about 70,000 bales per year, and hand-spinning can produce about 300,000 bales per year, totaling about 370,000 bales. This number is slightly different from the above estimate. Now, assuming that the former estimate is the highest output and the latter estimate is the lowest output, it seems reasonable.</p>
<p>(3) Supply of Cotton: According to the estimate of the Chongqing Agricultural Bureau, the cotton production in the interior is 1.2 million dan in the Shaanxi-Henan area, 300,000 dan in the Xiangfan area, 400,000 dan in the Dongting Lake area, 400,000 dan in the Zhejiang East area, and 500,000 dan in the Sichuan Central area, totaling 2.8 million dan. This is also quite similar to the estimate of the Central Agricultural Experiment Station.</p>
<p>The amount of supply and demand of cotton yarn and cloth has been estimated as above. Let's list and compare the estimated figures as follows:</p>
<p>According to the estimate of the Secretariat of the Chongqing Ministry of Economic Affairs, the interior population is 200 million, requiring 50 million bolts of cloth and 5 million bolts of military cloth, equivalent to 1.6 million bales of yarn and 6.1 million piculs of cotton. This is similar to the above estimate.</p>
<p>The estimated amount of demand for cotton yarn and cloth is as above. The estimated amount of supply is as follows: If we compare the lowest amount of demand with the highest amount of supply, the difference is 12,575,000 bolts for cloth, 150,000 bales for yarn, and 200,000 piculs for cotton.</p>
<p>As can be seen from the above table, the supply of yarn, cloth, and cotton is less than the lowest amount of demand, and their prices rose by more than two times in 1940 and about one and a half times in 1941. However, cotton yarn and cloth are not among the most insufficient supplies, so the severity of the shortage of supplies on price increases is no less than currency inflation. Moreover, at present, foreign supplies cannot be imported, and even if they are imported by plane, the quantity is extremely small, and the prospects are truly worrying.</p>

<h3 id="e23">The Pioneer of Shanghai's Business Community: New Asia Construction Industry Co., Ltd. (Continued) <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Now, let's briefly introduce the New Asia factories that New Asia Construction Industry Co., Ltd. is currently investing in: (1) New Asia Chemical Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., abbreviated as New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory, was founded in 1926 by accountant Mr. Xu Guanqun and pharmacist Zhao Rutiao. Initially, the scale was small, starting with the manufacturing of cosmetics and proprietary medicines. However, due to effective management, after more than ten years, the scope expanded, and business increased daily. Now, it holds the leading position among Chinese pharmaceutical factories. Offices are located throughout China and Southeast Asia, and branch factories are located in North and West China. Its main affiliated businesses include New Asia Glass Factory, New Asia Chemical Pharmaceutical Research Institute, New Asia Biological Research Institute, Guangcheng Pharmaceutical College, Guanqun Amateur Tutoring School, New Asia Library, and New Asia publications, such as English Medical Magazine, New Medicine Journal, National Medicine News, and Healthy Family. (2) New Asia Sanitary Material Factory Co., Ltd. specializes in manufacturing New Asia plasters, which are widely sold at home and abroad. Founded in 1937, by 1941, the business reached more than 1.3 million yuan, exceeding the original capital by four times, and the capital was increased to 1.2 million national currency to increase production and replenish raw materials. (3) New Asia Serum Factory Co., Ltd., was founded in 1938, with an initial capital of 300,000 national currency. It is said that it will soon increase its capital to 2 million yuan. In terms of manufacturing, it is divided into a preventive manufacturing department, a therapeutic product department, and a serum department. (4) New Asia Enzyme Industry Co., Ltd., was founded in 1941, with an authorized share capital of 1 million national currency. In 1942, the capital was increased to 3 million national currency to expand production. The currently produced yeast has been sold throughout the city to meet the fermentation needs of household flour. (5) New Asia Science Co., Ltd., was founded in 1941, with a capital of 1 million national currency. Products include various printed materials, various cardboard boxes, educational supplies, stationery, and instruments. (6) Hong Kong New Asia Chemical Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., abbreviated as Hong Kong New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory, was established in 1939 by Shanghai New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory in conjunction with overseas Chinese in Hong Kong. The initial capital was 500,000 Hong Kong dollars. A factory building was built in Kowloon, and medicines were made using raw materials produced in the tropics and sold throughout Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>The New Asia factories mentioned above are the targets that New Asia Construction Industry Co., Ltd. is currently investing in. As for future investment targets, generally speaking, it is to promote new-style industrial and commercial enterprises, and to cope with the new environment and new problems encountered by today's industrial and commercial circles, it is necessary to put materials, methods, spiritual strength, and overall strength together to develop general and socially needed businesses, whether industrial or commercial. In short, the ideal is to alleviate the current difficulties of private enterprises and plan for the post-war construction of private enterprises—and to move from the ideal to the realization—as an object.</p>
<p>Three. New Asia Construction Industry in Organization and Talent:</p>
<p>The organization of New Asia Construction Industry Co., Ltd. can be said to be simplified. In addition to its shareholders' meeting, board of directors, and supervisors, its internal structure absolutely adopts the principle of valuing quality over quantity. It absolutely does not follow the habit of setting up positions according to precedents or individuals. Therefore, the company is headed by the chairman of the board serving concurrently as general manager, and there are no titles such as deputy general manager, manager, assistant manager, deputy manager, or assistant manager under the general manager. There are only four departments: business, general affairs, auditing, and design. Each department is divided into sections; the business department manages sales, service, storage, and statistics; the general affairs department manages documentation, general affairs, personnel, and share affairs; the auditing department manages auditing, accounting, and cashier; the design department manages design, research, and writing. In addition, there is a consultant specialist office on the left and right of the general manager, specially for consultation.</p>
<p>On the day of the opening, a guest said this: "Although the capital of New Asia Construction Industry is nominally 10 million yuan, I am afraid that the talent of New Asia Construction Industry cannot be recruited with this 10 million yuan." In other words, its internal talent can be said to be all-inclusive. Such as Chairman Xu Guanqun, Managing Directors Zhu Boquan, Qiu Liangrong, Directors Zhao Rutiao, Gu Kemin, Hui Guangfang, Chuan Xiangcheng, Zhu Rutang, Xu Xie Kang, Wu Yunzhai, Ye Fuxiao, Xu Baohua, Shi Zuomou, Supervisors Li Bohan, Xu Jingzhi, Shi Quan, Cheng Mu, Cao Yuyu, are all leading figures in Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles, the business community, and the financial community; such as Zhang Guohua, director of the General Affairs Department, Yu Daosun, director of the Auditing Department, Li Tisheng, director of the Business Department, and Liu Yunfang, director of the Design Department, are all experienced specialists. It can be said that talents are gathered together.</p>
<p>Based on the above description, we can probably get a bird's-eye view of the newly opened New Asia Construction Industry Co., Ltd. We, who are in today's industrial and commercial environment, naturally hold infinite expectations and surge with full enthusiasm for this investment organization with principles, strength, organization, and talent.</p>

<p>Eastern Cloth Supply Fails to Meet Demand</p>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market initially rose and then weakened, and finally rose again. White Goods, 12-pound Earth Fine Cloth, opened at 195 yuan in the morning and immediately fell to 191.5 yuan. However, the market sentiment was high, and it continued to rise to 194 yuan.

<p>The French Concession Passive Defense Committee's October report states that during this month, a total of 18 air raid drills (including alarms, bombing, firefighting) were conducted within the French Concession. During the drills, the district police, cleaning squads, rescue teams, and first aid teams were all able to do their best. The speed with which they rushed to the scene of the incident after hearing the alarm was particularly gratifying. Each time, the president of the fire brigade also taught techniques such as climbing ladders and passing water buckets. The health department also sent specialists to the scene to teach basic first aid and methods of transporting the injured on stretchers. During the blackout drills, it was initially discovered that many residents lifted the curtains and turned off the lights. To prevent this phenomenon and to keep residents informed of the alarm at any time, the concession was divided into several small areas (Xiaodongmen divided into two areas, Mailan three areas, Xuhui six areas, Central six areas, Foch four areas, Beidang six areas), and each small area conducted a drill once a week. In November, a total of 118 blackout drills were conducted, with satisfactory results. All of the above drills will continue to be held in December.</p>

<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>(7) The Battle of the Philippines</p>
<p>On December 8th, Japanese army and navy air units launched a sudden attack on the American air force and major airfields in the Philippines, inflicting a fatal blow on the air power that the United States was preparing to use to attack the Japanese mainland. Before dawn on the 10th, they began landing troops ahead of the enemy on the northern shore of Luzon Island near Aparri and on the northwestern coast. The Japanese flag was raised on American territory in the Far East, which the Japanese called a "bloodless landing." On the 12th, Japanese troops also landed near Legazpi at the southeastern tip of Luzon Island. On the morning of the 20th, they occupied Mindanao Island, which is the second largest island in the Philippines after Luzon. From then on, the Philippine defense line was broken through.</p>
<p>On the 22nd, the main Japanese force landed at Lingayen on the west coast of Luzon Island, 200 kilometers north of Manila. From the 24th to the 27th, other areas were successively landed upon, encircling and attacking Manila. By New Year's Day of this year, Japanese troops had completely occupied Manila, the capital of the Philippine Islands. By early May, Japanese troops had taken complete control of the Philippines.</p>
<p>(8) The Battle of Borneo</p>
<p>During the first week of the Greater East Asia War, the three major Anglo-American military strongholds of Hawaii, Singapore, and Manila were attacked, destroying their naval and air power. In the second week, the center of the war shifted to the South China Sea—the main battlefield for Japan's war against Britain and the United States. Originally, Hong Kong to the north, the Philippine Islands to the east, the Malay Peninsula to the west, and British Borneo to the south, with Hong Kong, Manila, and Singapore forming the strategic triangle of the Far East for Britain and the United States, were the main bases for attacking Japan. On the first day of the war, Japanese troops first attacked Hong Kong, and on the third to fifth days, they landed on the northern and southern ends of Luzon Island in the Philippines. Then Vietnam and Thailand signed military agreements and alliances with Japan on the 11th, so the Anglo-American encirclement of Japan in the South China Sea had been broken through in various places. The only remaining base was Borneo. Borneo is the second largest island in the world, with the British-owned portion accounting for two-sevenths of the entire island, and the northern coast being an oil-producing area. Japanese troops landed on Borneo on December 16th, echoing Hong Kong, Malaya, and the Philippines, and controlled the entire South China Sea.</p>
<p>Japanese troops landed in Miri, Labuan, and Seria in Borneo. After a month of bloody fighting, by February 4th, British Borneo was completely pacified. From then on, the South China Sea, from Hong Kong in the north to Borneo in the south, and the Philippines in the east, were all occupied by Japanese troops; thus, the overall offensive against Malaya, especially Singapore, could be strengthened.</p>
<p>(9) The Fall of Singapore</p>
<p>Under the command of General Yamashita, the elite Japanese troops began landing on the Malay Peninsula on December 8th, occupying the Taiping airfield. On the 17th, Penang was occupied. On January 3rd, they captured Kota Bharu, an important air base 280 kilometers north of Singapore, making Singapore a target for Japanese fighter planes.</p>
<p>After the main force in the capture of Penang won, it continued to attack Perak. On the 23rd, they occupied Taiping, the world's top tin-producing area. On the 23rd, they crossed the Perak River, and on the 28th, they attacked Ipoh, the capital of Perak, securing an air base that directly threatened Singapore. On January 16th of this year, they penetrated into Kluang in central Johor. Then, on January 31st, Johor Bahru was captured. In the 55 days from December 8th to this point, Japanese troops advanced 1,100 kilometers, setting an unprecedented example of speed in the history of war.</p>
<p>Thus, the battle to capture the Singapore fortress began.</p>
<p>Singapore, this military base of the British Empire for invading East Asia, was built with a national defense expenditure of 400 million yuan, a long period of time, and painstaking construction, and was known as one of the two major fortresses in the world along with Gibraltar at the western mouth of the Mediterranean. But it finally suffered a ruthless attack by the Japanese army. On January 31st, Japanese troops began to forcibly cross the Johor Strait. On the night of February 7th, they landed on Pulau Ubin northeast of Singapore to contain the enemy. On the night of February 8th, they launched a general attack on Singapore, and at 7:00 PM on the 9th, they occupied Tengah Airfield. On the 11th, they seized Bukit Timah, and the Singapore city streets were within easy reach. On the morning of the 14th, they began operations in the Singapore city streets; on the afternoon of the 15th, they finally occupied Singapore, leaving a stunning page in the history of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>The occupation of Singapore has significant implications for determining the fate of East Asia. From a military point of view, first, the Anglo-American encirclement of Japan in the South China Sea was completely eliminated, and the British and Americans could no longer carry out a joint defense line in the Southwest Pacific. Second, from then on, the Japanese army not only became the master of the South China Sea, but also had to go on to resolve the fate of the Dutch East Indies, allied with the British and Americans. Third, after the Japanese army occupied Malaya and Singapore, it could go on to control the Indian Ocean and unfold a more ambitious future for the Japanese army.</p>
<p>From a political point of view, Singapore was the headquarters of the Anglo-American alliance against Japan. Japan's occupation of Singapore not only aroused doubts among the British and American people about the Anglo-American war effort in the Pacific, but also gave the Dutch East Indies a great blow in advance, and the morale of the Dutch East Indies was greatly frustrated as a result. In addition, the small countries of East Asia and the small ethnic groups who had been oppressed by Anglo-American and Dutch imperialists for more than a hundred years suddenly strengthened their confidence in the Asian nation, changing their worship or fear of the British and Americans in the past. This is of great significance in the awakening of the Greater East Asian nation.</p>
<p>(10) The Battle of the East Indies</p>
<p>The Dutch East Indies was where the life of Dutch imperialists lay, and on the eve of the Greater East Asia War, it was a major link in the ABCD line. Therefore, when the Japanese army captured Singapore, it immediately launched a general offensive against the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<p>First, on January 11th, Japanese troops landed in Tarakan on the east coast of Dutch Borneo, and on the 24th, they attacked Balikpapan, an important location on the east coast of Borneo, and completely occupied the city on the 25th. This is an important location in the South Pacific. After the occupation, Japanese troops could control the Makassar Strait, which was tantamount to inserting a sharp dagger into Surabaya, the heart of the Dutch East Indies. In January, on the 17th, they went on to pacify western Borneo, and by mid-March, Dutch Borneo had been completely occupied.</p>
<p>Secondly, on January 26th, Japanese troops occupied Sebatik Island in the Celebes Islands, controlling the Makassar Strait, forming a major threat to the Dutch East Indies and Australia. The offensive against southern Sumatra began on February 6th. On the 11th, they first defeated the enemy's air force. In less than ten days, Japanese troops had pacified the main areas of southern Sumatra, and Java was completely under the threat of the Japanese army.</p>
<p>After that, after the naval battle of Java, the Japanese navy and air force again achieved unprecedented victory. When Singapore fell, Dutch Java was isolated. On March 1st, Japanese army units forcibly landed in eastern, central, and western Java under the cover of the navy, immediately achieving great success, and the Southwest Pacific Allied Command was virtually dissolved. By March 5th, the Japanese flag was flying over Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies. The war moved to the eastern front, and on March 8th, the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies and the commander of the Allied forces bowed their heads and surrendered to the Japanese army.</p>
<p>From then on, the Anglo-American-Dutch counter-offensive base in the Southwest Pacific was completely destroyed. On the western front, Japanese troops were already facing the Indian Ocean, and on the eastern front, they had isolated Australia.</p>
<p>(11) The Battle of Burma</p>
<p>When the Japanese army was galloping across the Southwest Pacific and was invincible, the United Nations, in the midst of defeat, attempted to contain the Japanese army from another direction. The main thing here was to first strengthen aid to Chongqing and launch counter-offensives on the central, southern, and northern China fronts. Second, to realize Anglo-American-Chongqing military cooperation, strengthen the defense of Burma, and then advance into Vietnam and Thailand in an attempt to disperse Japanese forces. In these two strategies, Burma had very important strategic and tactical significance and could pose a major threat to Japan. Thus, Japan began the campaign to capture Burma.</p>
<p>First of all, in terms of air power, Japanese troops launched a major air raid on Burmese air bases as early as December 13th. After that, the Japanese air force continued to operate in various parts of Burma, with the main purpose of crushing the Anglo-American air force built in Burma.</p>
<p>When the Japanese army attacked the Malay Peninsula, the Japanese army had already occupied important positions near Tavoy, which belonged to Burma, a key point in the Kra Isthmus, on January 17th, in order to block reinforcements from Burma to Malaya. On January 20th, the Japanese air force heavily bombed Moulmein, the third largest city in Burma, to assist the army in attacking the Moulmein Plain. On January 31st, the city of Moulmein was occupied. Thus, all enemy forces east of Burma were cleared by the Japanese, and the aid route to Chongqing was completely within the Japanese bombing range; at the same time, Rangoon, the capital of Burma, was also isolated.</p>
<p>On February 10th, Japanese troops began to advance towards Rangoon, and on March 3rd, they launched a general attack on Rangoon, completely occupying it on the 8th.</p>
<p>After the fall of Rangoon, the British army quickly requested Chongqing to send troops to rescue them, and the Chiang army quickly advanced into Burma. However, before the camp was established, there was a large-scale retreat of British troops, followed by an unexpected flanking maneuver by the Japanese army. On April 29th, the Japanese army suddenly occupied Lashio, and on May 1st, they occupied Mandalay, the second largest city in Burma. Then, on May 3rd, they attacked Bhamo, and the Chiang army was surrounded and divided, even without a way out. On May 5th, the Japanese army rushed into the gate of Yunnan. From then on, Burma was no longer a barrier to India, and the Japanese army had surged to the edge of India, and the fate of the collapse of the British Empire in Asia was imminent. From then on, the Indians also stood up and demanded to decide their own destiny. (To be continued)</p>

<p>(1) This column welcomes the following types of contributions:</p>
<p>1.  Short comments or reflections that have positive meaning for society and culture, standing from the perspective of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>2.  Literary criticism, drama reviews, film reviews, etc. that contain positive and constructive elements.</p>
<p>3.  Historical sketches and scientific sketches.</p>
<p>4.  Social portraits—vivid descriptions of people or groups from various strata of society and industries, which must be based on facts.</p>
<p>5.  Novels, poems, paintings, photography, and local sketches that are suitable for the new era.</p>
<p>6.  Book and newspaper introductions and reviews.</p>
<p>7.  Cultural intelligence, simple reports on cultural organizations, figures, and works.</p>
<p>8.  Cartoons and woodcuts related to society and culture.</p>
<p>(2) Contributions should be written in vernacular Chinese, with the number of words standardized at no more than 1,000 words. Short articles of about 500 words are especially welcome. The word count of novels and special contributions that are too long are not subject to this rule.</p>
<p>(3) Except for special relationships, contributions will not be returned. Please do not enclose postage stamps.</p>
<p>(4) Contributions will generally be paid in cash, or the payment may be transferred for social and cultural public welfare needs as specified by the author.</p>
<p>(5) This column warmly welcomes contributions, suggestions, and criticisms from all walks of life.</p>
<p>Due to space limitations, "Free Talk" will be suspended for another issue today and tomorrow. Please pay attention, readers.</p>
