<p>海上梨園，競邀新角，入秋以來，各院氣象，益見蓬勃，如黄金之程貨，皇后之周張，更新之三李，已早成鼎足而峙之局。今則天蟾繼起，亦努力於舊劇之爭競，雄心勃勃，意態甚豪，旣從事於內部之刷新，復致力於名角之網羅，有志者事竟成，籌備匝月，居然有後來居上之勢，可知成敗靡定，事在人爲，固不能以牌子之新老，而斷勝劵之必操諸於誰也。</p>
<p>聞之人言。天蟾第一批新角，已邀定楊寳森鄭冰如王泉奎劉硯亭班世超諸人，昨得確報：並知楊鄭二大劇團之全體人馬，業已先後蒞止，稍事休養，即須涓吉登臺。按楊鄭二大劇團，在梨園界早已各有聲華，在南在北，均著佳譽，在滬埠更擁有大量數之觀衆，此次來滬，各以頭牌之姿態，作初步眞誠合作之嘗試，相互謙讓，相互照顧，旣不願蹈俗伶「同行嫉妬」之陋習，更不屑傚時令「惟碼是爭」之醜態，論戲定碼，悉依舊規，此種美德，尤宜加以獎許。彼斤斤於牌子戲碼之是較者，對楊鄭二人之相見以誠，其將何以自處耶？</p>
<p>寳森之藝，自幼即戞然獨造，不同凡響，近年以來，益加奮發，孜孜終日，矻矻窮年，其成就自非尋常俗子所能企及，古人有士別三日，便當刮目相看之語，今寳森與滬人士別已三年，此番重來，吾知期望於寳森者，定當側目而靦矣。至於冰如，素有金嗓之譽，二次南來，俱享盛名，最近在故都與譚富英合作一期，珠璧聯輝，九城轟動，揆諸士別三日之說，其藝當益見精湛，登裏有日，吾將拭目視之。</p>
<h3>寫在「刁劉氏」演出前</h3>
<p>— 林子風</p>
<p>幾年來從事戲劇生活的興趣是比較濃厚的，時常想預備在劇本的寫作方面嘗試和努力，但都因沒有勇氣而作罷。這一次，居然敢下絕大勇氣而又在一禮拜的功夫中寫成「刁劉氏」的　慕戲現在想想，暗暗好笑。</p>
<p>我怎麽敢嘗試的呢？</p>
<p>當第一次認識田心女士，在偶然的談話間，她說將加入紅寶劇場了，不過第一個戲還沒有決定，於是彼此想劇本，最後想到了這一個給人批評淫婦的刁劉氏，我就說，如果將刁劉氏搬上舞臺，應該予以重新估價，至少刁劉氏是一個閨閣千金，不是潘金蓮潘巧雲輩可相提並論的。田心就在同一的意見下慫恿我在最短期內完成這一個改編的工作，當時無法推辭，繼思嘗試一次也是好的，就也大膽接受了。</p>
<p>在全劇的觀點上，着重在刁劉氏與王文在當時封建制度中的戀愛，並說明玉瀾爲什麼會謀害刁南樓？同時從側面暴露那一羣表面嚴肅，實則也是過着荒唐生活的毛龍唐雲卿輩的嘴臉，關於刁南樓與刁劉氏間的暗礁，則在不同性格的刻劃下，可使人直覺到這一個悲劇必然要產生的。</p>
<p>關於「果報錄」中最誨淫的窺俗夜會以及七夕監會，這里雖也加以採取，情調則完全不同，而從戀愛至上主義一點上出發的。</p>
<h3>潘府堂會鱗爪</h3>
<p>— 黃山客</p>
<p>舉行一次盛大的堂會，正如給角兒們開一次競賽運動，見了面誰也不肯讓誰，各人大顯身手，非來一個龍爭虎鬬不可，精彩自不待言。日前滬西潘府壽事，舉行盛大堂會，劇目有程硯秋之賺父娟，李宗義之全部鼎盛春秋，陳大濩之定軍山，李玉芝之得意緣等十餘齣，可謂近來海上不常見的盛會。是晚到時，硯秋之戲早完，宗義已在臺上演文昭關，唱來似譚非譚，似汪非汪，白口則又似連良，味兒倒很配合一般人的胃口，特別值得一提的倒是他的嗓子，充沛萬分，不遜於當年的小達子，風個拔高的地方，嘩喇一聲振耳欲聾，不由你不叫一聲好嗓，他一口氣唱完一部鼎盛春秋，卻若舞其事，洵為難得。全劇演來尚無大疵，只是倒音多而太顯，其次為陳大濩的定軍山，誰說陳大濩是票友下海，只善唱而不善做，我便要給他大嗚不平，這天陳大濩的定軍山，眞不含糊，幾路大刀花，瀟灑而又邊式，唱幾句也够掛味，傳得滿座掌聲，在我座右的一位白髮老翁頻頻點首，驚嘆着說：「有出息！有出息！」可惜那晚因事早離，未能遍賞後來節目，尤以未觀玉芝之得意緣爲憾</p>
<h3>藝壇春秋</h3>
<p>— 麗萊</p>
<p>李之華毛羽處女編導作「男女之間』明晚獻演，該劇如一首淸麗的抒情詩，說它是喜劇，也在看完之後才使人莞爾一笑。</p>
<p>「四姊妹」外景隊於十六日夜車返滬，「兩代女性」外景隊於昨早赴杭；「梅孃曲」則要等「兩代女性」歸來後再去，這三部戲走馬換將，杭州的女學生們又要大起忙頭了。</p>
<p>看過了陳燕燕的「蝴蝶夫人」「芳華虛度」後，有人說，愈是陳燕燕態度自若，愈是使忍不住流下淚來。</p>
<p>陳大濩在天蟾之局，輟演後，聞現與某戲院在接洽中，擬在新年中大舉一番。</p>
<p>「中中」紅星淚中之布景，有採用立體的，此爲上海劇壇之創舉。至於「魯男子」的隆重公演，約在聖誕節左右。</p>
<p>「新中」神女之賣座成續，較「血淚相思」爲好，是劇中，趙如心，古寒等，都甚賣力</p>
<p>大光明或將短期上演話劇，劇名是「怒吼吧中國」，上臺演員的百餘人，影星劇人，集體演出。</p>
<p>李綺年正傾全力準備打進巴黎演「傾國傾城」。</p>

<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>一一　仇家</p>
<p>葉二太太看黄龍一臉怒容，就喊道：「誰都不許走出去！」先喊了一聲，然後和緩了語氣，說道：「他會作惡，就是自作自受，我們爲什麽要和他一般見識。」爲了葉二太太一說，誰都不願　違背她意思，黃龍把舉起來的脚步停下了，翠珍望着黄龍的臉和維城的臉，維城道：「這老傢伙一定要說翠珍姊在我家裏，他還是實在知道了呢，還是本來不知道故意這樣說的呢？」葉二太太道。「這倒不怕他，翠珍本來是我們的人，他指使着費長河來搶去的，他不追究也罷了，一追究，他顚倒擔上罪名了。」維城道：「搶人的罪名到底比殺人的罪名輕，連累着黄龍哥的案子也發覺了，也小合算。」</p>
<p>大家談論了一回，衛雲卿早走的很遠了，四野裏先後放着鞭砲。黄龍把桌子拍道：「年初一到了，一年只有一天，二伯母，我先給你拜年。拜了年，你再也不能駡我了。」他抱着拳向葉二太太拱拱，接着又說道：「來，我們來要錢，來一個小輸贏，不管男的女的，老的小的，是主子，是底下人，二伯母你也來。我們多不要來，到天色大明，輸了的不許翻本，贏了的，也不要擔心再會輸。來來！葉二太太爲了黄龍有言在先，倒也不能駁斥他，况且又想到了已是夜半，眞的是又一年的大年初一了，新年裏玩賭錢，正是少年人應有的樂事，便笑着點點頭道：「我對這個，一顆骰子是幾點，一副牌有幾張牌，我全不知道，你們來吧。」葉二太太一說，外面的阿興和何子興，偷偷的閃了淮來，黃龍問阿興要龍脾，阿興道：「有有有。」阿興去拿龍牌，何子興去拿骰子，徐全福去把籬門關了，都到翇梅書屋裏來。翠珍維城都給黃龍把興致提起來了，各目掏着胸哺口，把零錢掏出來，推舉黃龍做莊，黄龍道：「是孫子，才和你們客氣。」他居中一坐，把牌倒了出來。（二三）</p>

<h3>Tunisia in Crisis: Major Battle Looms, Allied and Axis Forces Close In, German and Italian Submarine Activity in the Mediterranean</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, Allied Press dispatch, 17th: Ten days have passed since American forces landed in French North Africa, and the war situation there and in the Mediterranean is gradually becoming clearer. On one hand, British and American forces are preparing to launch a major offensive into Tunisia, targeting the port of Bizerte. On the other hand, German-Italian Joint Forces Commander General Rommel has arrived in Tripoli and has begun deploying defenses on the border between Tripoli, Tunisia, and Tunisia itself. According to the London Daily Express, Rommel's forces number between 50,000 and 70,000, in addition to local garrisons and the Italian and German forces stationed in Tripoli. The number of tanks and artillery pieces is unknown. While British and American forces have air superiority, General Rommel may be able to obtain reinforcements from Europe. The Axis powers also have 500 submarines operating in the Mediterranean. In short, the major forces of both sides are gradually closing in, and a major battle is imminent. The British and American Allied forces require 1.5 million tons of shipping for supplies, making them a prime target for German and Italian submarine attacks.</p>
<p>Lisbon, Allied Press dispatch, 17th: The British and American forces headquarters in North Africa announced last night that it is too early to say that British and American forces have made contact with German forces near the port of Bizerte in Tunisia. However, it is a fact that British and American forces are entering Tunisia.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, Huitong Press dispatch, 17th: The British News Agency reports that some clashes seem to have already occurred in Tunisia, but they should not be seen as the prelude to a major battle. Other British sources say that Allied aircraft are quite active in Tunisia. As for the news that General Giraud has taken over the forces of General Catroux, the Allied side has not yet confirmed this. The attitude of the French forces in Tunisia is also unclear. Allied sources say that a vanguard battalion of French forces encountered German forces between Tunis and Djedeida and that French forces reportedly engaged German forces several days ago. According to General Anderson, commander of the British forces invading Tunisia, 90% of his troops are British, with American forces making up only 10%.</p>
<p>Vichy, Huitong Press dispatch, 17th: According to the French Information Department, fierce battles have taken place in the skies over various airfields in Tunis in recent days. Axis forces, with the consent of the French authorities, have assisted in defending Tunis.</p>

<p>Rome, Havas dispatch, 17th: General Headquarters has just announced that the North African campaign is currently underway between Derna and Benghazi. Axis aircraft bombed various airfields occupied by British and American forces in North Africa. Several aircraft were hit and caught fire. Enemy troops were also strafed by our aircraft machine guns. Italian torpedo planes also attacked a convoy of enemy warships escorting a large fleet of merchant ships near the coast of Algeria, sinking a medium-sized merchant ship. An Italian submarine penetrated the port of Bône and heavily damaged a large enemy merchant ship with gunfire. Six Italian aircraft failed to return to base yesterday.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, Huitong Press dispatch, 17th: An official Cairo statement stated that British forces in Cyrenaica have occupied Derna and Msus. The weather in North Africa has been bad in recent days, so British aircraft are not very active.</p>

<h3>Chairman Wang Inspects Zhanggong Dike, Addresses Military Commission Generals and Officers</h3>
<p>Hankou, Central News Agency dispatch, 17th: After arriving in Wuhan, State Council Chairman Wang, accompanied by his staff, inspected the construction of the Zhanggong Dike in the city at 9:00 AM on the 16th. The Zhanggong Dike is 21 kilometers long, and there were seven military inspection points: (1) Daijiashan, (2) Jinyintan, (3) Gusaoshu, (4) Zhanggong Dike Entrance, (5) In front of Boxue Shuyuan, (6) Lijilu Intersection, (7) Wholesale Market. When the car stopped at Daijiashan, Chairman Wang first got out of the car. He was led by Mayor Zhang and the Director of the Public Works Bureau up the steps of Daijiashan. He inquired in detail about the starting and ending sections of the Zhanggong Dike construction project, which was highly praised. He also surveyed the entire Zhanggong Dike from the high ground and gave detailed instructions. When he got out of the car at Gusaoshu, Chairman Wang also inquired about the sources of the Xiang River and the turbulent currents of the Yangtze River that caused floods. He also inspected the construction of the new Zhanggong Dike. After inspecting the road construction project at Lijilu, he went directly to the Cadre Training Institute of the East Asia Youth League of the China Branch and the Youth National Construction Academy, which are both located in the Boxue Shuyuan. Chairman Wang entered the lecture hall and addressed all the students, using the four characters of the academy's name (Youth National Construction) as the theme, explaining the responsibilities of Chinese youth in the current era for peaceful national construction and their future missions, in great detail. It was already noon, and Chairman Wang returned to the city's wholesale market for a week's inspection before driving to the Xingya Club to address all the generals and officers of the Military Affairs Commission's Wuhan Headquarters. First, Chief of Staff Yang of the Headquarters reported on the abolition of the Wuhan Pacification Headquarters after the establishment of the Headquarters, etc. Then, Chairman Wang gave instructions on three key points: (1) The officers and men of the Headquarters must all follow the advocacy of the "radiant telegram" issued by himself on December 19, 1938, and implement the national policy of peace, anti-communism, and national construction, in order to build a new China and work together with friendly nations to complete the victorious mission of the Greater East Asia War. (2) Military training and political training at the Headquarters shall be concurrently undertaken by the commanders of each unit, so as to unify military orders and simultaneously cultivate noble personalities and adhere to the soldiers' creed, with the aim of becoming a strong and brave elite force. (3) All officers and men of the Headquarters should be humble and self-respecting towards all agencies, work together with one heart and one mind, in order to ensure local security, thereby improving people's livelihoods, and dedicating themselves to the Party and the country.</p>
<p>Hankou, Central News Agency dispatch, 17th: Chairman Wang convened a meeting of important group workers at the Xingya Club on the 17th to give instructions. More than 100 senior cadres from four groups, including the Hubei Provincial Branch of the East Asia League of China, the Wuhan Branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, the East Asia Youth League of Central China, and the Soldiers' Association, attended the meeting. At 9:00 AM, Chairman Wang and Propaganda Minister Lin, accompanied by Secretary-General Yang of the East Asia League and Chairman Zhang of the Cultural Association Branch, set off from the Executive Yuan and went directly to the Xingya Club. At that time, the attendees were already standing respectfully in the auditorium waiting. The chairman, wearing a new national uniform and full of vigor, bowed to the attendees as he stepped onto the podium. The entire meeting then began to deliver instructions. After listening to the instructions, everyone was extremely inspired.</p>
<p>Hankou, Central News Agency dispatch, 17th: At 2:00 PM on the 16th, Chairman Wang went to Zhongshan Park to inspect the city's police, youth corps, and boy scouts. The city's police, male and female students from public and private schools at all levels, arrived at the scene one after another and lined up in order. In total, there were 60 units of elementary school boy scouts, 6 units of male and female middle school youth, and 6 battalions and 11 platoons of the city's police participating in the inspection, totaling 20,000 people. At about 2:00 PM, Chairman Wang and Supreme Advisor Matsui and his party arrived by car. When they arrived, the music played together, and the atmosphere of the entire venue was solemn and respectful. Chairman Wang and others slowly entered the venue and first held an inspection ceremony. Then, they ascended the stage, and Zhang, the Director of the Police Bureau, who was the temporary commander, shouted "Attention!" and everyone saluted to pay their respects to the Chairman. Immediately, the flag-raising ceremony was held. Amidst the sonorous music, the national flag of the blue sky, white sun, and red earth slowly rose. After the flag-raising ceremony, everyone sang the national anthem, and then Commander Zhang reported the numbers, totaling 1,500 police officers, 2,600 youth corps members, and 7,000 boy scouts, for a total of 11,150 people, who were inspected separately. First, the police performed morning exercises in a marching formation. The band led the way, marching at a regular pace to the front of the command platform. The police saluted respectfully, with uniform steps and coordinated movements. Chairman Wang frequently waved his hand in response. After the inspection was completed, the youth students held a general assembly exercise. The commands were shouted, the pace was consistent, and the formation was very neat. It was truly spectacular to gather thousands of students in one place. After the general assembly exercise was completed, Chairman Wang gave instructions. After the instructions were completed, the boy scouts held a flag-presenting ceremony. The characters on the flag read "Rebuild the Rivers and Mountains." After the flag presentation was completed, slogans were shouted, music was played, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>Hankou, Central News Agency dispatch, 17th: Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, after Chairman Wang inspected the youth corps, boy scouts, and the city's police, Chairman Wang went to the Tijing Hall to rest. The city government's liaison officers went to pay their respects, and the Chairman gave a brief speech of encouragement. Afterwards, representatives from various people's groups in the city presented flags with the inscription "Benefit the People." At 3:30 PM, Chairman Wang entered the Kang Le Hall. Mayor Zhang of the city government, followed by senior officials, committee members, section chiefs, clerks, and principals of various schools, gathered here to bow and salute. Chairman Wang ascended the stage to listen to the mayor's report on government administration. At 3:40 PM, Chairman Wang began to give instructions, with the following key points: (1) First, he shared his observations after inspecting the Zhanggong Dike and the youth corps and city police, praising the progress he had seen in Wuhan compared to when he came to Hankou in April 1940. Secondly, he explained the main purpose of reorganizing the provincial government and establishing the Wuhan Headquarters, which was to achieve military-political unity and unify the army in order to ensure security in Wuhan. He urged the city government and the provincial government to work together with one heart and one mind, to cooperate closely. As Wuhan is separated by a river, security and transportation are closely related. The provincial government, city government, and headquarters, these three agencies, should work together to shoulder the responsibility of ensuring security. (2) Regarding the food issue mentioned in the mayor's report, he referred to the fact that Wuhan was able to increase its fertile land by 3,000 acres through the repair of the Zhanggong Dike, and instructed that efforts should be made to reclaim wasteland and plant miscellaneous grains in order to increase production. The Executive Yuan previously rewarded various localities that reclaimed wasteland and increased production above a certain amount with medals. At that time, only two people received awards, and Mayor Zhang was one of them. This is Mayor Zhang's glory and the achievement of the city government and the people working together. In the future, we should follow the example of Zhanggong Dike, turning any available land into fertile land, or planting miscellaneous grains, vegetables, and trees, in order to solve the food problem and stabilize people's livelihoods. (3) Regarding the issue of legal currency circulation, after the return to the capital in 1939, the Central Reserve Bank was established. At that time, the circulation area was limited to the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, because the economic foundation needed to be established and consolidated in a small area before gradual development. However, this caused concern among many people, who thought that friendly countries wanted to split Guangdong and Wuhan from the National Government, and suspicions arose. Until this year, when Guangdong and Wuhan provinces and cities promoted the new legal currency, this used the facts to break all slander and suspicion. From this, we can see that as long as we are sincere and combine the three minds of loving China, loving Japan, and loving East Asia into one, and recognize that Japan is an advanced country in East Asia and China is a powerful member of East Asia, Japan must assist China in order to revitalize East Asia, and China must cherish Japan in order to revitalize East Asia. Do not use this as diplomatic rhetoric, but use this as a central belief, a lifelong belief. If you are sincere, then the facts will prove it. China can be saved, and China has a bright future. (4) Regarding the New Citizen Movement, according to Mayor Zhang's report, an organization has already been established to promote it, which is extremely gratifying. Wuhan has always been able to promote various movements to a climax. Geographically speaking, Wuhan is also located in the center of the country and on the front line of the peace zone. Therefore, if the New Citizen Movement can be promoted in Wuhan, the atmosphere will have excellent results and a huge impact. (5) Finally, he gave instructions to the city party headquarters. Among the comrades in the city party headquarters, there are city government officials and non-city government officials. It is precisely because they are not city government officials that they should stand in the position of the common people and lead the people. Before the incident, the party headquarters interfered in politics, leading to the meaning of a dual government. After the return to the capital, we worked hard to correct the previous malpractices. We must know that the government implements the resolutions of the party headquarters, and the party headquarters is still in the position of the people and is an activity of the people. The party headquarters is the leader, leading the youth with the youth, and leading the people with the people, which has an extremely rapid impact and great success. This is more effective than leading the people with the power of the government. Take Germany as an example, in its youth movement, the head of state only needs to give instructions, and the power to promote it lies in the youth themselves. I hope that the city government and the party headquarters will cooperate sincerely and work hard together, which is the source of success for all undertakings. After the incident, Hankou was in an environment of disintegration, separation, and painful exile. We should work harder and make more efforts. I would like to express my respect for all the previous efforts of the city government colleagues.</p>
<h3>Spanish Cabinet Holds Emergency Meeting</h3>
<p>Madrid, Huitong Press dispatch, 17th: The Spanish Cabinet held an emergency meeting last night, chaired by General Franco. Although officials have kept silent about what happened, it is believed that the meeting passed several important resolutions related to the North African war.</p>
<h3>Severe Earthquake in North-West Frontier Province, India</h3>

<h3>Darlan Organizes French Political Advisory Council</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, Huitong Press dispatch, 17th: This morning, the British News Agency reported that Moroccan radio reported that Darlan, after taking office as Commander-in-Chief of French North Africa, organized a French Political Advisory Council last night to assist in administrative and legal matters.</p>
<h3>Heavy Snowfall in Various Parts of the Eastern Front, Large-Scale Warfare Has Been Halted, Troops Repairing Winter Shelters</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, Havas dispatch, 17th: Heavy snowfall has been occurring in Stalingrad and the Caucasus Mountains in recent days, and the roads everywhere are frozen and muddy. Large-scale warfare on the entire Eastern Front has effectively stopped. Occasional conflicts are only small contacts between a company or battalion. The industrial area in Stalingrad, which was originally the focus of the current war, has also become silent. What the soldiers are busy with is no longer the struggle for every inch of land, but the construction of winter shelters. According to a German battlefield reporter, it suddenly snowed in the Stalingrad area on the 19th of last month. Since then, heavy snow has been falling almost non-stop. Fortunately, the soldiers have learned from the experience of last fall that the climate in the Soviet Union may turn cold at any time, so they were not completely unprepared this time. The problem is that Stalingrad has become a pile of rubble, and winter shelters have to be taken from basements. German soldiers are currently busy repairing them.</p>
<p>German Supreme Headquarters, Huitong Press dispatch, 17th: This afternoon's German war report stated that German forces in the north of Tuapse and the Elbrus area penetrated deep into the enemy's strong positions, fought bloody hand-to-hand battles, and destroyed many enemy fortresses and strongholds. In the Terek region, enemy forces launched an attack under the cover of tanks, but were ultimately unsuccessful due to the brave fighting of our troops. An enemy oil tanker in the Caspian Sea was sunk by German aircraft, and two others were damaged. Our fighter groups continued to heavily bomb the railway east of the Volga River. Our reconnaissance teams were exceptionally active southeast of Lake Ilmen. Soviet troops on the Volkhov front launched several attacks, all of which were repelled by German artillery fire.</p>
<p>Berlin, Huitong Press dispatch, 17th: German forces in the Caucasus continued their offensive in the snow. After repelling enemy forces, the German mountain troops in the western Caucasus continued to expand their front lines. Fierce battles took place in two locations.

<h3>Japanese Government Lodges Strong Protest with Britain: Japanese Residents Detained in India Subjected to Abuse</h3>
<p>Tokyo, Central News Agency dispatch, 17th: In view of the inhumane treatment of Japanese residents detained in India by the British side, the Japanese government lodged a strong protest with the British government in mid-September. However, after the Japanese residents who returned to the country on the Japanese-British exchange ship claimed, it further proved that this was the truth. Therefore, on the 7th of this month, the Japanese government again notified the Swiss Minister to England and the Swedish Consul General to India, issuing a strong protest to the British government and the Indian Governor-General's Office. On the 17th, the Swiss and Swedish authorities replied to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that they had handed over the protest to the British authorities. It is said that the inhuman treatment of Japanese residents detained locally by the British and Indian authorities has caused extreme hatred among the Japanese public. According to the Japanese who returned on the exchange ship, the unreasonable means they used were as follows: The tents where the detainees lived were not only small and cramped, but also reached a temperature of 120 degrees Fahrenheit during the summer, and there were no cold-weather facilities in the severe winter. Moreover, the tents were often damaged by wind and rain. In addition, the food for the Japanese residents was quite poor, resulting in widespread emaciation from hunger. Furthermore, the housing lacked necessary appliances, and the laundry rooms and bathhouses were poorly equipped, and were not hygienic. The toilets were practically non-existent and far from the residence, which was quite inconvenient for the elderly and young. In addition, medical facilities and medicines were also incomplete, resulting in an outbreak of dysentery in the detention center.</p>

<h3>Rice and Grain Management Committee Issues Bread Certificates, Limited to Registered Food Households Only</h3>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Rice and Grain Management Committee of the Public Works Department, the issuance of bread certificates has been quite smooth since the committee directly handled the matter. However, some residents occasionally have misunderstandings, believing that all residents have the right to receive bread certificates. However, this is not the case. The issuance of bread certificates is mainly to maintain the food supply for foreign residents, as they do not have the right to buy rice certificates. As for Chinese food households, it is also limited to those who are registered. These Chinese people completed their registration procedures before the implementation of food rationing per capita. As for those who want to apply for registration to receive bread certificates now, except for foreigners who do not have the right to buy rice certificates, Chinese people are generally refused. However, those who want to exchange flour for bread can directly contact the 42 manufacturers. Retail bread stores do not have this obligation.</p>

<p>The prevalence of tuberculosis is increasing daily, which has aroused deep concern among people. The medical community and social figures have taken action to prevent tuberculosis for the sake of protecting health, which is commendable. However, the methods are only to instruct patients to take X-rays or to instruct how to treat the disease, which does not seem to be a fundamental solution. How should the public be instructed to understand the dangers of tuberculosis and how to prevent it? After approval by the Public Works Department's meeting, in the near future, those who spit anywhere on the road or in other public places will be fined five yuan each time.</p>
<p>Sanitation Campaign</p>

<p>Tuberculosis Patients</p>

<h3>Shanghai Price Countermeasures Committee Decides on Maximum Price for Cotton Cloth, Effective December 1</h3>
<p>According to the Allied Press, the Chinese and Japanese authorities, in view of the fact that stabilizing prices after the unification of the currency in Central China is the most important task in maintaining the price of reserve notes and stabilizing the lives of the people, have been actively suppressing the rise in prices since September. First, the general retail prices were stipulated to be limited to the prices at the end of May. However, wholesale prices have not yet been controlled, so the wholesale market for various important commodities has been rising sharply. For example, the market price of cotton yarn has risen by about 1,000 yuan per bale compared to early September. The Japanese Embassy Office and relevant authorities are actively seeking countermeasures for wholesale prices and have decided to stipulate the maximum wholesale price of cotton cloth, the largest industrial product in Central China, as the first step. The Shanghai Price Countermeasures Committee, organized by Japanese officials, previously hoped that Chinese and Japanese textile industries would submit cost calculation tables for various goods. Based on this, the committee quickly stipulated the maximum prices for various goods. A final decision was made at the committee meeting on the 16th. The municipal government, the Japanese Consulate, the Public Works Department, and the Public Concession Bureau will issue announcements on the 18th, which will be implemented from December 1st.</p>

<h3>New Drug Stocks Show Significant Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese stock market fell sharply again. More and more people sold off to cash in. Investors were constrained by tight credit. The decline in the textile industry rebounded again, especially for new stocks with small face values ​​that have not been opened for trading for a long time, such as Hongsheng and Dachunhua two weaving companies and Shanghai Cotton Weaving Meilun Velvet. Each was lowered by 2.5 to 5 corners. The Great Light Weaving is still around 13 yuan. Yong'an Textile fell slightly at the 1,800 yuan mark. The cultural industry is the most stable. The world alone rose by one yuan. China fell by another five yuan. Business Communications and Yongxiang were both flat. In the department store industry, Yong'an Company is still around 129 yuan. Xinxin and Guohuo are down 2.5 yuan and 4 yuan respectively. China Underwear is down half a yuan. In the new pharmaceutical industry, only Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory is doing well, and the price has risen by 7.5 corners. Minyi (90 yuan), Zhongfa (107 yuan), Wuzhou (470 yuan), and Zhongxi (465 yuan) all have significant declines. Dachunhua Matches once again rose to the 300 yuan mark, but finally fell slightly by 2.5 yuan. Nanyang Tobacco fell slightly. Public utility stocks stood out, with more demand than supply. Zhabei Water and Electricity saw a high price of 45.5 yuan, but fell back near noon, still rising by one yuan. Chinese Electricity rose to 34 yuan, up 5 corners. Gongxin Electricity sellers shouted 14 yuan. Other stocks showed little improvement. The market price list is fierce.</p>
<h3>Kemico Shares Enter the Market</h3>
<p>Kemico Pharmaceutical Factory was founded by Sheng Pihua, Xie Shengzu, Xu Yongzu, and others. The original capital of 600,000 was used to manufacture various Western medicines purely for experimental purposes. Some of the products, such as "Calcium Supplement Mother" and "Anmai Tablets," have been trusted by people from all walks of life in recent years. It was recently resolved to increase capital and expand shares to 2 million yuan, with a face value of 10 yuan. The transaction price in the previous two days was around 19 yuan. However, due to the extremely scarce chips, the demand exceeded the supply. All stock companies know the contents of the factory, so investors are competing to buy them as a success.</p>
<h3>Price of Gold Ornaments Suddenly Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market price of gold jewelry at the Dasing Peer Gold Jewelry Store in the city was initially 2,650 yuan per tael. Around 10 o'clock, it suddenly rose to 5,000 yuan, estimated at 2,700 yuan (buying in was about 300 yuan less). The price among peers is still stable and firm, at 2,450 yuan in the morning, up 30 yuan, and after falling back to 2,440 yuan, it immediately rose to 2,455 yuan, up 35 yuan. The market was even firmer at noon, and transactions were normal.

<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market conditions: The Japanese military scrip still showed little change. The price among peers was 5.5535 yuan. The buying and selling prices at small money houses and banks were 5.55 yuan and 6 fen.</p>
<h3>Public Debt Trends Are Elusive, Scalping Transactions Are Extremely Popular</h3>
<p>Outside the public debt market, market conditions tend to be stable. Most people do not seem to be concerned about control countermeasures. Those who are long are still eager to move, so the turnover once rose from 4.56 yuan to 5.5 yuan. Although it once fell back slightly to 4.5 yuan in the middle, it still rose back to 5 yuan. Currently, there are no time regulations for outside-the-market transactions. Opening hours are often before the stipulated time, and closing hours are often unlimited. As a result, scalping transactions on the table, taking advantage of the convenience of time, expand and contract easily, and market prices also fluctuate from time to time. Those who are long are afraid that they are not high enough, and those who are short are afraid that they are not low enough. Yesterday's transactions mostly rose and fell in this situation. The highest price for Type C was 5.5 yuan, the lowest was 4.5 yuan, and the result was 5 yuan, slightly higher by 2 corners. The highest price for Type A was 4.8 yuan, the lowest was 3.8 yuan, and it was also slightly higher by 3 corners. The highest price for Type B was 2.1 yuan, the lowest was 1.8 yuan, and the final was 2.2 yuan, also good for 4 corners. Types D and E are relatively strong, D is 50.08 yuan, good for 9 corners, and E is 52 yuan, good for 1 yuan. There were also transactions for 96, with the high at 10.05 yuan, the low at 9.8 yuan, and the final at 10.03 yuan. The trend is still very elusive. The transaction volume was about 1.89 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Fine Cloth Prices Rise, Supply Can't Meet Demand</h3>

<h3>Guanghua Dyeing and Weaving Company</h3>
<p>Engaged in Silk Mercerizing Weaving Factory Products Using Dragon Boat Brand as Trademark</p>
<p>Guanghua Dyeing and Weaving Factory Co., Ltd. is currently being organized. Once established, it intends to use the operation of the Zhongxin Silk Mercerizing Dyeing and Weaving Factory as its foundation. The factory has a long history, and its products use the "Dragon Boat Brand" and other trademarks, selling well in the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and in South China. The factory is located on Luban Road in this city, covering an area of ​​eleven mu, with more than forty additional workshops. The machinery and equipment consist mostly of the latest models purchased successively over the years. The equipment is extensive, beyond complete listing. The most effective equipment includes eight Gaozhuang Jinghua refining boilers, three water rolling machines, one singeing machine, one German toothed cloth mercerizing machine, one German toothless silk mercerizing machine, twenty-three pairs of dyeing machines, two sets of German Ann An blue machines, three double-width twenty-roller drying machines, one German seven-roller calendering machine, one German electro-optical machine, three German fifty-foot stretching machines, two German thread silk mercerizing machines, eighty-six iron weaving machines, one German thirty-roller napping machine, fifty-one hosiery machines, four Lake Xu boilers, and fourteen complete row heads, plus more than one hundred large and small motors, totaling one thousand horsepower. In summary, the factory's production capacity, if fully operational, can produce 4,000 bolts of bleached and dyed goods per day, all of which can be mercerized. The weaving section can produce 200 bolts of patterned cloth and poplin per day. The napping section can nap more than 100 bolts per day. The thread silk mercerizing section can produce 8,000 pounds of refined products or 12,000 pounds of semi-refined products per day. The hosiery section can produce more than 500 dozen pairs per day.</p>
<h3>Persimmon Cake Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Only sixty pieces of Qingdao persimmon cakes have arrived in batches. The goods are of good quality, and the listed price has also been released at 350 to 360 yuan. According to a letter from Xuzhou, the production price of Wu Village and Zaozhuang goods has risen. The first batch of sources is relatively expensive, and the market is unlikely to ease.</p>
<h3>Hyliss Fluctuation</h3>
<p>Hyliss fluctuated yesterday. Goods below 100 yuan from public and large firms saw a decline, as they are made from a mixture of scissor-cut broken wool and various scraps, and Factory Five has a steady supply. Hyliss priced above 100 yuan per yard saw a firm rise, as they cannot be made with Huzhou wool and scissor-cut scraps. Imported goods are more popular. Renli goods have not been shipped to Shanghai for a long time, leading to a surge in popularity for goods made by Shanghai yarn factories. Yesterday, Shanghai Hyliss was selling for 145 yuan per yard. Public and large firm Hyliss No. 1 was at 95 yuan, No. 2 at 85 yuan, and ordinary mixed grades were at 60 to 70 yuan. Imported ordinary single-width Hyliss was around 300 yuan per yard, while genuine Hyliss was around 300 yuan per yard.</p>
<h3>Commercial Briefs</h3>
<p>Silk Fabric Remains Weak: Arrivals are still scarce, and market inventory is not high. However, demand from all parties has been dormant for a long time. Foreign firms called for high prices for previously arrived goods, but with little acceptance and small quantities, it is said that they have followed the market and opened prices, with little fluctuation.</p>
<p>Fungus Stagnant: Black fungus has been in short supply for a long time. Merchants have little stock on hand, but prices are already high, and demand is sluggish. Currently, the market price for Zhuang Si is 3,800 to 3,900 yuan, and for ordinary, 3,500 to 3,600 yuan.</p>
<p>Medicinal Gorgon Fruit Arrivals and Inventory are Scarce: Red and white skin medicinal gorgon fruit arrivals have been scarce for a long time, and sales have been broad. As there have been no new shipments from the Guang Gang recently, the market has become quiet again. Merchants are all calling for the original prices. According to news from the North Road, this year's new goods have already appeared.</p>
<p>Sundries: Firm and quiet as before. Yesterday's market transactions were still sparse. More than ten packages of Wu Jiang selected greens were priced at 282 yuan, twenty packages of Chongming sand red were priced at 260 yuan, and fifty packages of sand silkworms were priced at 220 yuan.</p>

<h3>Thoughts on Yang Baosen and Zheng Bingru's Collaboration</h3>
<p>— Master of the Plum Blossom Pavilion</p>
<p>The Shanghai opera scene is competing to invite new stars. Since autumn, the atmosphere in various theaters has become more vibrant. The trio of Cheng (Cheng Yanqiu's), Zhou (Zhou Xinfang's) and Zhang (Zhang Junqiu's), and the new trio of Li (Li Shifang's), have long formed a formidable force. Now, the Tianchan Theater has risen, also striving to compete for old dramas, with great ambition and a grand demeanor. It is engaged in internal innovation and is also committed to attracting famous actors. Those with aspirations will eventually succeed. After a month of preparation, it has surprisingly gained momentum, proving that success or failure is not fixed, and depends on human effort. One cannot determine who will definitely win based on the newness or oldness of the brand.</p>
<p>I heard from people that Tianchan's first batch of new actors has invited Yang Baosen, Zheng Bingru, Wang Quankui, Liu Yanting, Ban Shichao, and others. Yesterday, I received confirmation that the entire troupe of Yang and Zheng have arrived and are resting briefly before taking the stage. Yang and Zheng's troupes have long been renowned in the opera world, with good reputations both in the South and the North. They have a large audience base in Shanghai. This time, they come to Shanghai as headliners to make a preliminary attempt at sincere collaboration, being humble and considerate to each other. They are unwilling to follow the vulgar habit of "envy among peers" and even less willing to imitate the current trend of "competing for status." They discuss plays and determine status according to old rules. This kind of virtue should be praised. Those who haggle over fame and status, what will they think of Yang and Zheng's sincerity?</p>
<p>Baosen's art has been unique since childhood. In recent years, he has become more motivated, working diligently day and night, year after year. His achievements are beyond the reach of ordinary people. The ancients said that one should look at a scholar with new eyes after three days of separation. Baosen has been away from Shanghai for three years. I know that those who expect from Baosen will surely look at him with admiration. As for Bingru, she has a reputation for her golden voice. She has enjoyed great fame in her two previous visits to the South. Recently, she collaborated with Tan Fuying in the former capital, and their joint performance was brilliant and caused a sensation in the nine cities. According to the saying that one should look at a scholar with new eyes after three days of separation, her art should be more exquisite. I will be watching her performance.</p>
<h3>Written Before the Performance of "Diao Liu Shi"</h3>
<p>— Lin Zifeng</p>
<p>My interest in drama has been quite strong in recent years. I have often wanted to try and work hard in writing scripts, but I have given up because I lacked the courage. This time, I mustered great courage and wrote the play "Diao Liu Shi" in a week. Thinking about it now, I find it secretly amusing.</p>
<p>How did I dare to try?</p>
<p>When I first met Ms. Tian Xin, in a casual conversation, she said that she would join the Hongbao Theater, but the first play had not been decided. So we talked about scripts and finally came up with this Diao Liu Shi, who is criticized as a licentious woman. I said that if Diao Liu Shi were brought to the stage, she should be re-evaluated. At least Diao Liu Shi is a lady from a noble family and cannot be compared with Pan Jinlian and Pan Qiaoyun. Tian Xin, with the same opinion, encouraged me to complete this adaptation work in the shortest possible time. I could not refuse at the time, and then I thought it would be good to try once, so I boldly accepted.</p>
<p>The whole play focuses on the love between Diao Liu Shi and Wang Wen in the feudal system at that time, and explains why Yu Lan would plot to murder Diao Nanlou. At the same time, it exposes the faces of those who are outwardly serious but actually lead a licentious life, such as Mao Long and Tang Yunqing. Regarding the reefs between Diao Nanlou and Diao Liu Shi, under the portrayal of different personalities, it can make people feel that this tragedy is bound to happen.</p>
<p>Regarding the most obscene scenes in "Guo Bao Lu," such as the peeping at the vulgar night meeting and the Qixi surveillance meeting, although they are also adopted here, the mood is completely different, and it is based on the principle of love supremacy.</p>
<h3>Glimpses of a Private Theatrical Performance at the Pan Mansion</h3>
<p>— Huangshan Ke</p>
<p>Holding a grand theatrical performance is like holding a competition for the actors. No one is willing to give way, and everyone shows off their skills. It is a fierce competition. The Shanghai Pan Mansion held a grand theatrical performance recently, with performances such as Cheng Yanqiu's "Earning Father Juan," Li Zongyi's "Complete Flourishing Spring and Autumn," Chen Dahuo's "Dingjun Mountain," and Li Yuzhi's "Satisfactory Marriage," which can be called a rare grand event in Shanghai recently. When I arrived that night, Yanqiu's play was over, and Zongyi was performing "Wen Zhao Guan" on stage. His singing was similar to Tan (Xinpei's) but not Tan, similar to Wang (Guifen's) but not Wang, and his dialogue was similar to Lian Liang's, which was very much to the taste of the general public. What is particularly worth mentioning is his voice, which is full of energy and not inferior to that of the Little Dazi of that year. When he raised his voice, it was deafening, and you couldn't help but shout "Good voice!" He sang the entire "Flourishing Spring and Autumn" in one breath, as if he was dancing, which was really rare. The whole play was performed without any major flaws, except that the falsetto was too frequent and obvious. The next was Chen Dahuo's "Dingjun Mountain." Who said that Chen Dahuo was a amateur who entered the profession, only good at singing but not good at acting? I want to speak up for him. Chen Dahuo's "Dingjun Mountain" that day was really unambiguous. Several sets of saber techniques were dashing and stylish, and his singing was quite tasteful, winning applause from the audience. An old white-haired man sitting to my right nodded frequently, marveling and saying, "Promising! Promising!" Unfortunately, I left early that night due to some business, and I could not fully appreciate the later programs, especially the regret of not seeing Yuzhi's "Satisfactory Marriage."</p>
<h3>Spring and Autumn in the Art World</h3>
<p>— Li Lai</p>
<p>Li Zhihua and Mao Yu's first directorial work, "Between Men and Women," will be presented tomorrow night. The play is like a clear and beautiful lyric poem. If you say it is a comedy, you will smile after watching it.</p>
<p>The "Four Sisters" location shooting team returned to Shanghai by night train on the 16th. The "Two Generations of Women" location shooting team went to Hangzhou early yesterday morning. "Mei Niang's Song" will have to wait until "Two Generations of Women" returns. These three plays are being filmed one after another, and the female students in Hangzhou will be very busy again.</p>
<p>After watching Chen Yanyan's "Madame Butterfly" and "Wasted Youth," some people said that the more calm Chen Yanyan's attitude is, the more people can't help but shed tears.</p>
<p>Chen Dahuo stopped performing at Tianchan Theater. It is said that he is currently in contact with a certain theater and plans to make a big splash in the New Year.</p>
<p>The scenery in "Zhong Zhong"'s "Red Star Tears" uses three-dimensional scenery, which is an innovation in the Shanghai theater scene. As for the grand performance of "Lu Manzi," it is scheduled for around Christmas.</p>
<p>The box office success of "New Zhong"'s "Goddess" is better than "Blood and Tears of Lovesickness." In this play, Zhao Ruxin, Gu Han, and others are working very hard.</p>
<p>The Grand Theater may stage a play in the short term, titled "Roar, China!" More than one hundred actors, including movie stars and theater people, will perform collectively.</p>
<p>Li Qinian is doing her best to prepare to perform "Alluring the Nation" in Paris.</p>
<h3>Film Festival Extended for Three Days</h3>
<p>The film festival has been a great success. It is now known that the association has extended the exhibition for another three days at the request of various groups, closing on Friday of this week. The price of admission tickets has also been reduced to two yuan across the board to show preferential treatment.</p>
<p>(Editor's note) The film festival organized by the Anti-Tuberculosis Association is full of works, brilliant and dazzling, all in sight. The beautiful scenery of lying down and traveling is breathtaking. We are specially introducing it to our readers.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat in the Storm</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>— — A Feud</p>
<p>Mrs. Ye Er saw Huang Long's angry face and shouted, "No one is allowed to go out!" She shouted first, then softened her tone and said, "He will do evil, and he will suffer the consequences. Why should we be like him?" Because of Mrs. Ye Er's words, no one wanted to disobey her. Huang Long stopped his raised foot. Cui Zhen looked at Huang Long's face and Wei Cheng's face. Wei Cheng said, "This old fellow must say that Sister Cui Zhen is in my house. Does he really know, or is he pretending not to know?" Mrs. Ye Er said, "There's nothing to be afraid of. Cui Zhen was originally our person. He directed Fei Changhe to rob her. It's okay if he doesn't pursue it. If he pursues it, he will be charged with the crime." Wei Cheng said, "The crime of robbing people is lighter than the crime of killing people, and it also involves Huang Long's case. It's not a good deal."</p>
<p>After everyone discussed it for a while, Wei Yunqing had already gone far away. Fireworks were set off in the fields one after another. Huang Long slapped the table and said, "The first day of the Lunar New Year has arrived. There is only one day in a year. Second Aunt, I will wish you a happy new year first. After wishing you a happy new year, you can't scold me anymore." He clasped his fists and bowed to Mrs. Ye Er, then said, "Come, let's gamble for money. Let's have a small win or loss. Regardless of men or women, old or young, whether you are the master or the servant, Second Aunt, you come too. Let's not come too much, until it is dawn. Those who lose are not allowed to win back, and those who win do not have to worry about losing again. Come on!" Mrs. Ye Er had Huang Long's words beforehand, so she couldn't refute him, and she also thought that it was already midnight, and it was really the first day of the new year. Playing gambling games in the new year is exactly what young people should be happy about, so she smiled and nodded, "I don't know anything about this. How many points are there on a dice, and how many cards are there in a deck? You come." As soon as Mrs. Ye Er said this, A Xing and He Zixing outside secretly flashed in. Huang Long asked A Xing for dragon cards. A Xing said, "Yes, yes, yes." A Xing went to get the dragon cards, He Zixing went to get the dice, and Xu Quanfu closed the fence door. They all came to the Fumei Study. Cui Zhen and Wei Cheng were both aroused by Huang Long's interest. They all rummaged through their pockets and took out change, recommending Huang Long to be the dealer. Huang Long said, "Only grandsons are polite to you." He sat in the middle and turned over the cards. (23)</p>
