<h3>近東各國專輯</h3>
<p>二·土耳其槪述（一）</p>
<p>自從一九一四年大戰以來，有三個轉變得最劇烈的國家，叫全世界民族，不論大小，不分强弱，都一致感覺到觸目驚心的，那就是日耳曼，蘇聯，和土耳其。而其中劇變的經過最足震聾發瞶，與夫勵精革新精神的純正和專一，最足令一般弱小取爲楷模的，莫過於土耳其　國。這裏我們應當將他介紹一番，以供參考。</p>
<p>病夫綽號的由來</p>
<p>從中國歷史上我們很容易找到一個古怪的名稱—突厥—，這個名稱，凡讀過國史的，大約還不大感覺生疏。這個種族，據說是平涼雜胡；曹操北征平涼的時候，一部分的胡兒就遷移到阿爾泰山脚下，這就是突厥的始源。其後被回紇驅逐，一部分的突厥就重復遷徙到阿拉伯及小亞細亞一帶。在阿拉伯一帶的，要數到塞爾柱Seljuk一枝；在小亞細亞的，就是後來創土耳其帝國的奧托曼Othman一族。這兩枝突厥在世界歷史上，都出過一陣鋒頭。塞爾柱的一族，曾經對敵過七次的「十字軍」速征人馬；殺殺砍砍，幾幾乎鬥到了一百年這麼長的一個時期。以一個種族的旁枝，對敵四五國的聯軍，而始終是站在勝利的一方面，可也就不容易了。到了第十三世紀末尾從小亞細亞跑來了一位奧托曼，一番經營，便做了土耳其的開國皇帝。在歷史上看到了這段紀事，倒也足以銷除些胸中的壘塊，不是嗎？</p>
<p>奧托曼創國之後就自稱為蘇丹Sultan，蘇丹就是回教國大皇帝。從這位大皇帝起，六七百年來，一連串出了幾位雄才大略的英明人物，把一個草原的小部落，開拓到雄據亞歐非三洲的一個大國家，這眞是當初被曹操趕走的平涼雜胡，做夢也不會想到的咧。</p>
<p>零碎的戰績和逐步的開拓，也無庸細表；只說到了十六世紀中葉的土耳其時代，她的疆土是個什麼形勢。囫圇呑一齊算在內，那時的土耳其可以說擁有非洲北部一帶，如現在法屬阿爾及利亞，突尼斯，的黎波里，埃及；亞洲方面有阿拉伯，已勒斯坦，叙利亞，外約坦，伊拉克，並外高加索；歐洲方面到有整個的巴爾幹半島，黑海北岸，及多腦河的中部一帶。其時的黑海，地中海，紅海，愛琴海等，可以說都在土耳其勢力範圍之內。一部民族的光榮開拓，到這時侯，眞可說達到了最高峯。要曉得這麼大的一塊版圖，最初着手的本錢，僅僅只有小小的五百個戶口哩。</p>
<p>常言道：「日中則昃，月盈則虧」，是個至理朋言。別看土耳其小本錢做到了這大一番事業，可是也就在這十六世紀後中鑽進了一部倒霉運氣：先有威尼斯和奧地利亞找她的麻煩，盛極轉衰的奧托曼帝國，只好吐出一些地盤，退守東南歐。到了十八世紀，俄國出了一位英主彼得大帝，看中了土耳其從東羅馬搶來的君士坦丁堡，這黑海的咽喉，於是大舉南侵。這一來，土爾其弄得有些招架不住，把一個強橫霸道的帝國，攪得國運日蹙，半籌莫展。這時候土耳其倒也不祗是武力衰頹，軍心不振；內政方面也窳敗非常，苛稅重歙，民不聊生。試想這偌大一片土地，人民有二十餘個不同種族，言語文字，各不相似，宗敎各別，一旦這統治者，有坍台倒壁的現象，這種組合，當然弄得形勢日非，浸漸而至於一蹶不振也。</p>
<p>自從一七九二年俄國割據了克理米亞，奧托曼帝國就開始土崩瓦解起來。於是塞爾維亞和希臘相繼獨立。一八七五年巴爾幹開首叛變，埃及脫離。這麼一來，英·法·俄·奧·意，天天都在君士坦丁堡跟這位老大帝國「吃講茶」，「講斤頭」，其勢汹汹，簡直就要把她拿去豆剖瓜分起來。這時侯，當然沒得說的，那「病夫」二字的雅號，輕輕就套在土爾其頭上了。直到一九一二年，巴爾幹二次戰事爆發的前夜，土耳其一直是度着長吁短嘆的日子，一天也不會抬起頭來。</p>

<p>舟車半價優待之申請、舟事半價優待券雖已取消、但體念貧苦市民之困苦、並商得有關各方面之同意、如有人數在二百人以上之集團準備回籍者、可向該會由請半價優待、接到申請後、即可請予核准、</p>
<p>交通工具接洽、集團市民之疏散、除可申請半價優待外、如目的地甚遠、交通不便者、並可代爲向有關方面接洽船隻，以利疏散工作、</p>
<p>臨時通行證之頒發、該會頒發之歸鄕通行證、僅可用於離滬、而不可憑之返滬、惟有若干市民、或有要事返鄕、或陪家眷離滬、而須於短期內返滬、爲弭除此種困難起見、乃另發臨時通行證一種、由該會與萬國高團兼發、</p>
<p>疏散工作之加緊推進、過去三月的工作、僅能稱爲疏散工作的萌芽、而不能即目爲疏散工作業已完了、因據統計表所示工商二項所占共達百分之七七·五、而他項（包括婦孺、無業者）則僅占百分之二〇·一、可見過去三月注重於失業者之疏散、而今後則應注重非必要留滬之無業者婦孺之疏散、以求貫澈疏散工作之終極目標、擬加强宣傳工作、勸導非必要留滬市民迅速疏散、</p>

<h3>哥倫比亞路　基督敎難童院一瞥　共收養苦難兒童四十八人　遠離市廛生活完全鄕村化</h3>
<p>本埠哥倫比亞路蔣家弄基督敎難童敎養院、成立已歷兩載、所收容者、均屬顛沛流離之難童、最先主辦人為美國教會曼英女士、今春美僑由滬撤退、改由本國敎會人士李百强·黃蘭玉　許紹棣　等、設立董事會、繼續維持、</p>
<p>雜蒔園蔬</p>
<p>基督敎難童敎養院、在哥倫比亞路之盡梢、地名蔣家卉、距離囂市已遠、完全鄕村景象、蔣家弄之進口處、有石橋橫跨河塘、過橋即係該院、景物幽美、院址佔地二畝半、正中一棣平房七間、每間折而爲兩、闢爲十四間、平房四週、地位空曠、雜蒔園蔬、</p>
<p>院務設備</p>
<p>正中平房、設有課室臥室浴室膳室等、臥室共佔兩大間、男女各佔一間、女臥室置高脚木架床十只、每只上下分成兩舖、可容二十人睡臥、男臥室有床十二只、可容二十四人、另有兩鐵床、亦可容五六人、每一舖面、均按置自整潔之棉布被褥、臥室北端壁際、置有木板格子架、作爲難童放置面盆盥具之處、每人均編有號碼、井然有序、</p>
<p>難童籍貫</p>

<p>日常生活</p>
<p>難童之日常生活、爲上午六時起床、盥洗後、自行收拾臥室、做早晨禮拜、隨即進早餐、餐畢、年長男生、即往園圃鋤耘或播種菜蔬、至九時上課、或作其他課外活動、至中午十二時進午餐、午後照常上課、至晚五時半進晚餐、惟三餐均爲薄粥、和以摘自園中之菜蔬、有時煮白粥、而以自種之蠶豆等佐餐、宛然農家生活、別具風味、</p>
<p>教養周至</p>
<p>每逢星期六下午輟課、為難童沐浴之期、水則取自園中井水、燒溫後使用、星期日則由院長領赴附近教堂做禮拜、故其生活完全集體化、院長猶如家長、敎員恰似保姆、融融洩洩、樂乃無窮、</p>
<p>經費困難</p>
<p>惟該院主持人最感煩惱者、厥爲經費問題、因該院旣無基金、又無經常接濟、每月開支、悉恃董事會之籌墊、尤以膳食一項、雖以三餐薄粥計算每月亦需米四包、計費一千六百元、如是不僅難於爲繼、而擴大收容苦童之計劃、更難實現、故極望樂善人士、賜予臂助、並歡迎赴該院參觀、該院通信處在　漢口路四二二號季百强君、或　漢口路一二五號許紹珊君、</p>

<h3>歐洲大導演高天倫萬里流浪來滬（下）　識拔妖冶明星瑪琳黛德麗半年間一手包辦傀儡劇團</h3>
<p>高天倫在歐洲電影界中，具有相當地位，他所領導的西洋傀儡劇團，已在本埠上演數次。可惜對白和歌詞，都是德文，能欣賞的尙屬少數。聽說英文劇同業已譯好，大概下一次這新鮮玩意兒就要用英語來表演了。</p>
<p>本報記者最近會去訪問這位流浪的歐洲電影導演，關於他的寓所，和導演傀儡劇時的神情，已見昨報。這里所紀的是他如何識拔大明星瑪琳·黛德麗，以及出亡東來後的奮鬬情形：</p>
<p>識拔瑪琳黛德麗</p>
<p>「這是一九三七年春天，瑪琳和我在聖琦爾京—（奧國南部的一個名勝遊息區）合攝的影片」—（圖見昨日本報）高天倫先生從一堆照片中終於把它找尋了出來。接着，他便把發現她的經過，很高興地述說了一遍。</p>
<p>他說，大約是一九二五年吧，他那時正在杜別士·沙却電影公司Tobis　Sacha　Film　Co任職。一次電影塲中的人都散去了，而老闆却要攝製一部影片，裏面需要很活潑的女角。在應徵者的許多靑年女子中，他發現了一個明眸皓齒，體態苗條，鬈髮如雲的姑娘，這就是後來被人稱爲天生尤物的妖冶明星瑪琳·黛德麗女士。</p>
<p>「她所演的一齣是什麼戲呢」？我問。</p>
<p>「是Cafe　Electrie—電氣酒店」他想了一想，翻開了十七年前的「舊賬薄」纔把這據名背了出來。</p>
<p>瑪琳·黛德麗常在電影中飾風流動人的當爐女，可見得是「由來已久」的了。</p>
<p>高天倫把他在聖·琦爾京和瑪琳會晤的情景，來了一個「特寫」鏡頭，他的高興神情，恕我拙筆難以描寫了。</p>
<p>廿七年電影工作</p>
<p>在抽烟，狂笑，感嘆，凝思……的種種動作中，高天倫重溫他在歐洲各地撬製電影的舊夢、從他的談話中，我知道了一些他過去的身世：</p>
<p>他於一八九五年六月十五日，生於維也納，受過相當的敎育，已婚。一九一四年開始投身電影界。他到過柏林·慕尼黑·布拉格·布達佩斯德·布魯塞爾·和倫敦等地，都是在電影塲中工作。一九三九年從維也納出亡，在巴黎逗留了一會，便到馬尼刺。和當地一家美尼弗電影公司訂了五年的合約。那張音樂浪漫片“Huling”Pagheha——（意爲最後的眼淚）據說買座頗好。去年六月中離菲來滬，因爲事變，只好在上海度那沒精打彩的生活。而那一部名叫「日光」的片子，所有已經預備好的攝製計劃，只好完全擱淺了止，高天倫，據他自己說，在二十七年中，前後經他設計導演，剪接，製造的大小影片，總數共二百九十六部。</p>
<p>高天倫談到在馬尼刺攝製影片的經過時，神氣起初是非常緊張，他把報紙的評論，紀錄，據目單，宣傳品等給我看，差不多沒有一張印刷品上沒有A.Gottlein字樣：最後他又把那費了一番心血，結果完全付諸東流的「日光」一劇的厚厚的三本對白腳本翻給我看。裹面德文，英文和菲文並列。還有全副登塲角色的備配表，場面畫片，和置景說明等等，都高高的堆在這三巨冊腳本上面。他的聲音越說越低，神情越弄越呆滯；竟像電影中的「淡沒」法一樣，終於他有氣無力的對我說：</p>
<p>「先生，一切都完了」！（至此，大家都沒有聲音，祇有雨點打在玻璃窗上）</p>
<p>亭子間中的奮鬥</p>
<p>「那末你總得想些方法才對呀！」我說。</p>
<p>好像他又　醒了，兩雙眼睛又漸漸地射出光芒來。</p>
<p>「木偶戲，」他提高着嗓子，把上半身　在寫字台上，而對著面的對我講。</p>
<p>「在七八個月中間，我親自動手，造成了那些木偶；又親自訓練提綫者，教他們如何把木偶在台上搬動！我們又在這間屋子中，整日整夜的練習對白，配合音樂。一切的佈景，道具，燈光，　幔等等，都是我們親手自己做的。你知道，先生，要是假手於人，那末些微的資本，怎能調度呢……</p>
<p>在他五分鐘的自訴中，我感覺到這個具有二十七年電影導演經騐的人，在無可如何的環境中，在赤手空拳的情形下，把以前的一切都一筆勾銷了！他把幾家百萬資本的大電影公司，十來個經他導演過的影星，數千個電影從業員……縮……縮……縮小——而成為一班傀儡劇團。他把數百方尺大的電影場中，「卡末拉，」</p>
<p>「克脫」等的大導演精神，搬到「亭子間」中來；去導演那些十八英寸高的一排木偶了。他頹廢麼？沒有。他失望麼？沒有。他滿足麼？沒有。</p>
<p>離開了亞爾培路高天倫的寓所，我得了這三點感想。</p>

<h3>龍眼（六）</h3>
<p>— 高劍晨</p>
<p>採摘龍眼的時期大約在白露以後。周亮工閩小紀說：「龍眼枝甚柔脆，熟時賃慣手登採，恐其恣啖，與約曰：「歌勿輟，輟則弗給值。」樹葉扶疎，人坐綠蔭中，高低斷續喁喁弗已，遠聽之頗足娛耳，土人謂之「唱龍。」這又是多麼富於詩意富於田家樂趣的一種舉動啊！採摘時又必連帶着少許莖葉以便久藏。至於焙製之法，農政全書上說：「採下，用梅　浸一宿，取出曬乾，用火焙之，以核乾硬爲度，……成朶乾者名龍眼錦。」熱帶果樹栽培法上說：「……常於採後剪去其枝，浸水缸中，約十分鐘之久；更用竹　和細沙搖之，擦其殼，化粗爲光。……傾焙竈上焙之，……焙法宜微火，不宜猛火，火性烈防燒殼。焙約間四句鐘必翻轉一次，二十小時之久始乾。須善觀火候。……旣焙之後，更剪平，和　黃貯竹　內搖之，使殼部勻着黃色，以防蛀蟲。……粒子大者曰「正貳」，再大者曰「禿禿」，更大者曰「大三」，每箱裝五十斤。較小者曰「禿貳，再小者曰「興極」，每箱均六十斤。……」</p>
<p>世界上的事情，如同離了缺陷」就不成其爲世界一樣，，「其肉瑩白如水晶丸」的龍眼——梧潯雜佩語——當然也不能例外：破壞龍眼的種種害蟲，在開花時有專吃花芽的龍眼圭，結果時築巢果中吸食漿液的白　蟲和烏蟻。至於閩小紀說；「間中龍眼熟時，專有飛盜，緣接枝樹，矯捷如風，若巨寇然：瞬息不覺，則千萬樹皆被漁獵，名曰「夜鶯」。……我們竟想像不來這是、種什麼東西！……</p>
<p>最後的結論是：凡甘美雋妙有益人類的植物，大多數全飛黃騰達廣佈在世界各處了，龍眼——還有荔枝等——則還局促在亞洲南部，而沒有遠出過家門一步哩。這並不是它沒有同旁的水菓並駕齊驅的資格，而是尙缺少一位大有力的知己來稍一援手呵！現在「乾」的龍眼，已經在歐美各大都市漸露頭角了，進一步的培栽和廣播，或者爲時不至過久呢（完）參考書古今圖書集成草木典杜亞泉　植物大辭典周亮工　閩小紀等：</p>

<h3>粗獷的感情</h3>
<p>— 雷若華</p>
<p>作為一個故事，傷感或能擕成動人的情節；作爲一齣戲劇，它也或能博得觀眾的同情和眼淚；但，作爲生活，它只是一種不幸，一種腐蝕劑。在這樣的日子里，傷感已是一種恥辱了。</p>
<p>一天，朋友和我說，他變得野了。當時我默然，事後却常常記起這句話來。也許人都有這樣的一個時候吧：他的神經是敏銳的，他的感情是纖弱的；一遇刺激，便有點歇斯底裏，一不如意，便淚如泉湧了。他是一個雀兒，躱在自己的窠裏。</p>
<p>只是生活艱難的，幾經磨練砥礪，而仍能勇敢地活下去的人，感情便也變得粗獷了。他不會太息，他不會傷感，他不會悶坐在小樓一角聽雨聲，他不會誦吟春花秋月何時了。他咬緊了牙，他支持着。他記住的是生活，他想着的是生活，他要活下去。</p>
<p>感情的粗獷是一種學習，是　種値得的學習。雀兒的翅膀硬了都要向遠處飛，人誠實，更重要的倒是對自己誠實；你或者有理由哄騙別人，但是，你憑什麼要欺瞞自己呢？</p>
<p>天氣熱起來了，夏天要來臨了吧，你覺得冬天很遙遠嗎？冬天是一個過去嗎？你說季節與季節之間，是否像是缺少了一點什麼？那麼，你怎麼能再和人家說，「來，讓我們談談畫眉，談談玫瑰，談談美麗的眼睛，和靑春的笑顏」呢？我們有的是這樣的天氣呀！</p>
<p>變得野一點吧，變得粗獷一些吧。</p>
<h3>孩子的生命</h3>
<p>— 凌霄</p>
<p>大風暴中注意不到一個幼小生命的毀滅，在孩子死後，我時常道樣想着。</p>
<p>雖然環列於週圍的是記不淸楚數不明白的悲劇，雖然理智警舍我不應把先前值得懊悔的到事後怨恨，雖然我懂得無可挽救的過去了的損失將很難補償。</p>
<p>也許是自私：我愛着我最近死去的孩子。尤其因爲窮途憂患，我覺得應該給予孩子的實在太少；不，這是被制於一種可怕的力量，剝奪了我可能對孩子有所給予的機會。</p>
<p>我的孩子八歲了。從家鄉來到上海，他喪失了應有與必需的一切：營養，快樂，被窒息在一間狹小的樓房裏，整日接觸着憂鬱的臉，甚至承受到長輩洩氣的暴戾。孩子有點懂事了，他再也支持不起這一種過度沉重的迫害，開始了疾病。對疾病的戰鬬，是必須爭取到金錢與時間這兩個支拄的。</p>
<p>孩子足足病了三個月，病情是很多轉變的。沉重點，「到醫生那裹去一趟罷！」輕鬆點，大概不嚴重，儘可等些日期再打主意。」有時，精神煩惱與生活磨折使我抓到了自暴自棄的理由：「孩子長大了作什麼呢？」</p>
<p>一直到可怕的症象從孩子身上表現以後，恐懼，惶亂，懊恨，怨恧，一重重叫我嘗受到人生所難堪的苦楚。孩子的叫喊，昏厥，以及停止呼吸之後慘白憔悴的形容，妻的哭，朋友的慰藉，我從緊張的心緒轉變到麻木，恍惚，悵惘，以至空虛。</p>
<p>現在是深深感到了寂寞。心在沉落，腦在痙攣，我時常想丟棄道個可悲的回憶，每一個勳境，凡是與孩子聯繫得起來的，我就拉進腦神經中儘量的思素咀嚼。直到我痛苦，我流淚，好像我對孩子無力庇護的罪過已經獲致應得的刑罰之後，我才爽然若失，恢復了理智。</p>
<p>這時世，應該沒有比生命更爲廉價的東西。我的孩子不過是此時拍賣塲中一件犧牲品而已。一個浪花在大漩渦中消散，那是多麼平常的現象。我個人庇護不了孩子，其實也何嘗覆護得了自已？</p>
<p>但，我理會世界終會容許這一種對於孩子們的愛。</p>
<h3>反芻類「人物」</h3>
<p>— 夏九鼎</p>
<p>德國的大哲學家尼采，在他的「蘇魯支語錄」裏，這樣說過：「耍是人的肚子內生了反芻的器官，將多麼名貴呀！」（這是大意，原書已賣給燒鉼店換餅來吃了。）人會有反芻。牛馬才有這種東西。</p>
<p>人倘若有了反芻，到底有什麼好處呢？尼采的原意出乎常人領悟之外，照理或許是這樣的：</p>
<p>我們人類的大敵人是「胃」：胃把我們的食物消化了去，叫我們吃過之後再要吃，不吃簡直辦不到，爲了吃，一切社會問題與國際事變接踵發生了，追溯起來，不是起因於，「胃」嗎？</p>
<p>大批科學家都在想盡心機去對付這個「胃」，但除了若干新聞報道外，像什麼「不飢丸」，「特殊食糧」等，沒有見過事實的表現。有次一個聰明人說：「把肺病的空氣針打進胃裏豈不好嗎」？不行，第一，每次空氣針要三十元（注意：收新法幣），等於大菜一客，不配大衆化：第二，一肚子的氣豈不要把人「氣」死了，連太平飯都等不及吃了？怎樣辦呢最好是反芻！</p>
<p>目閉目一想：把飯吃下去，收進反芻的囊裹；「胃」要來掠奪了，不給；餓呀，隨牠去，連帶都不用收緊；餓呀，餓他媽的三天，再從囊裹還一點出來，以饜「胃」的饞慾；這樣「牛皮糖」似地下去，以拉鋸戰應用到消化機能上去，一頓飯起碼供十天之用，軋平米也可以舒服一點了。</p>

<h3>偉人的記憶力</h3>
<p>— 荊棘</p>
<p>美國最著名的植物學家亞沙葛雷能够記憶兩萬五千種植物的名字；凱撤也可以記憶他數萬心腹士兵的姓名。</p>
<p>查利·卓別林有一位七年來不離其左右的私人書記，但最奇怪的，據那位書記語人，卓別林還是不知道他姓甚麼。</p>
<p>英國名詩人拜倫，會自誇過能背誦他所寫的全部詩句；但相反的，華爾特斯考脫的記憶力眞壞，他竟會忘記他自己所寫的詩篇；他有一次會把自己的作品錯認爲拜倫寫的，並加以熱烈的讚美呢！</p>
<p>英國哲學家培根，儘可默寫他自己一部著名的作品，而且一字都不錯的；但美國舞台明星約瑟夫賈弗生雖然連演了十三年的「列拍大夢」還是要時常忘記了劇中的對白。</p>
<p>英國歷史學權威者麥考雷的記憶力，眞有點合乎我國俗語所傳：「一目十行，過目不忘！」任何一章書他祗讀一遍即可背誦，他寫過許多歷史鉅著，但從來沒有用過什麼參考書之類。</p>
<p>美國老羅斯福總統的記憶力也是值得稱頌的，他在接見賓客時，最歡喜注意客人的小節，面貌或舉動；他只要見過你一次，他就永遠不會再忘記你了！當他第二次再見到你時，他立刻會直呼你的名字。有一次，他和一位闊別十五年的日本銀行家見面，最使這日本銀行家驚奇的，是他在一面的刹那間，便大談其十五年前初次會見時所會談過的一件事情啊！</p>
<p>林肯會吿訴我們一個「記憶秘訣」：每逢要牢記行麼時，不妨高聲朗誦，使視覺和聽覺同時發生效力。</p>
<h3>有加利樹</h3>
<p>— 化時</p>
<p>澳洲產　種巨樹，名叫有加利樹，目前，爲科學家們所注意，因爲從這種樹的葉子裹提鍊出來的油，可以充作燃料。</p>
<p>經過多次試騐，有加利油，不論什麼用途，皆可以代替石油。</p>
<p>這種油的熱量甚高，可以和汽油媲美，使用的結果甚爲滿意：一輛車子行二十四哩耗汽油一加侖，若以有加利油與汽油混合，一加侖可行二十八哩，如單獨用一加侖之有加利油，則汽車可行三十六里了。</p>
<p>狄愛博士謂此油與汽油，煤油或酒精混合使用時，發動機便不致時常汚穢了。</p>
<p>大概一千斤葉子，可以鍊出二十五斤油，其方法甚爲簡單。</p>
<p>除了澳洲外，非洲北部如阿爾及利亞等地，均有出產，但尙沒有採取利用。</p>
<h3>斜視糾正器</h3>
<p>— 永運</p>
<p>眼睛也如人體上的其他器官一樣，需要運動。最近發明了一種用雷力控制的器具，可以糾正斜視，並且可以做一般眼睛運動的儀器。道種糾正器並非如　湖醫生用來騙錢的玩意兒，曾屢經試用，功効確乎頗著。</p>
<h3>新西蘭的摩里人</h3>
<p>— 馬蘭</p>
<p>世界上所存的原始土著民族多半日趨衰微，但新西蘭的摩里人則是一個例外。所有的人種學家皆公認摩里人的文化水準確乎高過其他原始民族。而其成就亦確勝人一籌。在新西蘭議會中亦佔數席地位。但最使人困惑不解者，是他們的種源問題。</p>
<p>新西蘭是廣漠無邊際的太平洋中的一點，而它却是摩里人唯一的久居的家鄉。太平洋其他各島上雖亦有類似型式之民族，只是他們的文化特性並不相若。</p>
<p>摩里人的種源問題或許永不能解決，因爲沒有確鑿的證據。但有人認爲是來自印度。此說雖不能必信，亦不能不信。</p>
<p>只是我們有理由可以相信摩里人初是居於裏海附近的白色高加索人。數千年前，他們繞道西北方侵入印度。漸漸的高加索人乃與印度人混合。由於人口增加的結果便移到緬甸，再次經各小島而達於爪哇。再下過澳大利亞之北部海岸而達新西蘭。其中令人百惑不解者，是廣漠的北澳大利亞海岸竟未引起他們的注意。</p>
<p>這番移民的動機起於人口膨脹，這運動竟連續數千年。約在五百前他們發現新西蘭。這以前，他們在太平洋各島上居住過，是著名的航海者。白種人則是在摩里人的大移民已經結束之後，才到新西蘭的。不過是後來居上，建設了自家的新天地而已。全境人口約有百數十萬。還未能望上海的項背呢。</p>

<p>家裹又頓時熱鬧起來，維城一眼瞧見國芳，忙問道：「翠珍姊在那裏？」國芳道：「你隨我來。」維城跟了國芳，走到翠珍睡的房外。維城道：「她不睡在嬸娘房裏了嗎？」國芳指點門框邊那張紙條給他看，搖搖手。維城看了道：「這是你寫的，謝謝你對於她非常的關懷。」國芳一笑道：「我也想替代她說這麼一的話你倒是先說了。她現在躺着，不需要人去慰問。我問你，你知道翠珍姊的舅舅和舅舅的女兒，現在還是從墳地上回到了這裏嗎？」維城道：「咦！你怎麼問到這個，敢是翠珍姊托你問的？」國芳眞怕把聲音驚醒了翠珍，忙招招手，把維城引到外邊，一笑道：「我只問你，他們父女有沒有來？」維城道：「沒有吧。我眞是苦塊昏迷，還沒知道費長河是來還是沒有來。」接着有人來找維城說話，國芳道：「你去，你遇見我的哥哥，要他到裏邊來。那紅旗張，是說定了送我們到這裹來，還送我們回上海去的。</p>
<p>葉家直鬧到黃昏時候，道塲散了親友大半也散了。葉二太太撫摩着維城的肩背道：「維城，你今天是累了。跪了起來，起來了又跪，出殯的當兒，合起來倒也要走四五里路，這不比是高與的事，多走幾步也沒關係，你今天是累了。」國器見葉二太太這樣說，就跟着說道：「維城，你是該早些睡，我們兄妹也到了下船的時候了。希望你能在一個月之後：到上海來。你是居喪，我們兄妹，不敢陪着你去找尋逾分的娛樂，陪着你散散心，解解悶，總還是許可的。」維城一把抓住了國器的手道：「不許走，讓紅旗張多等一宵沒關係的。我好容易等着你來，也沒說什麼話。」國器不等他再申述其他的理由，說：「你不叫我走，我就不走。」維城得知翠珍照常起來，心裏更寬慰了。道一晚，百忙中維城和國器有了閒談的機會，一談却談到了國芳。　（八七）</p>

<h3>Both Sides of the Donets River: Germany Deploys Artillery Positions; Tank Battle in the Kharkiv Region Unprecedented in Scale</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Bucharest, May 16th: Military sources here state that the fighting around Izyum and Lozova in the Kharkiv area has reached its peak, with hand-to-hand combat occurring in several places. However, all Soviet attempts to break through German lines have failed. The German High Command has deployed artillery positions on both sides of the Donets River and concentrated armored units to repel enemy forces. Military operations south of Kharkiv have now come to a temporary halt, with heavy losses on both sides, although no exact figures are available. A Soviet pocket that was approximately 80 miles deep on May 20th has now shrunk to 10 miles. The deepest point of Soviet penetration was west of Mykhailivka, at the intersection of the Kharkiv-Chaplyne railway and the Poltava-Sloviansk railway. According to unconfirmed reports, the Kharkiv-Chaplyne railway line is still in German hands. The Soviet-held area south of Kharkiv is now limited to the area along the Krasnohrad-Sloviansk railway. If this information is accurate, the Soviet Union has lost the city of Lozova, which it had recaptured several months ago. Military observers here also note that the battle between General Bock's German forces in the south and Timoshenko's forces is the fourth such encounter. In the previous three, the Soviet forces were defeated due to encirclement. General Bock is again using the same strategy, and Timoshenko is repeating his mistakes, resulting in another defeat. Modern warfare is about speed, but the Soviet Union has never been able to copy Germany's blitzkrieg tactics to fully utilize its combat power. This is the main reason for its defeat. If the Soviet forces had immediately advanced towards Krasnohrad after occupying Lozova, the situation would be different today. At the beginning of this year, when the Soviet forces launched a landing in Crimea, they also lost the opportunity due to slow action, failing to put the southern Soviet forces in a favorable position. In short, the Battle of Kharkiv is a prelude to the German offensive, and the German High Command has already found the best tactics to deal with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Rome, May 26th: The Roman People's Daily recently published a report from a war correspondent in the Kharkiv area who said, "I have witnessed the great tank battle in the Kharkiv area, the scale of which is unprecedented. The roads leading to the front lines are filled with vehicles going back and forth. Supply convoys carrying food and ammunition are heading to the front lines, while soldiers from the front lines are being transferred to the rear for rest. Fierce fighting has been going on in the area for 12 days. Three Soviet giant tanks attempted to destroy an important railway junction, but they were destroyed by German anti-tank guns and are still overturned on the battlefield. From my observation post in [unknown] I can see the city of Kharkiv looking like a great warship damaged by artillery fire. It is fragmented and covered in fire. Tall buildings are almost entirely destroyed by artillery fire. In short, General Timoshenko's artillery and air force have been bombing the city of Kharkiv day and night, but his tank and other army units have not been able to directly attack the city."</p>
<p>Reuters News Agency, London, May 27th: Regarding Kharkiv, the German communiqué last night stated that they were annihilating the surrounded Soviet forces. The Soviet communiqué stated that they had consolidated their positions. The two communiqués are listed below. The Soviet communiqué at noon today stated that in the Kharkiv area, our forces consolidated the positions they had occupied last night. In the Izyum and Barvenkovo areas, our forces were engaged in fierce fighting with German tank units and infantry. There were no major incidents on other fronts. The communiqué of the German High Command stated that the annihilation of the surrounded Soviet forces south of Kharkiv is progressing rapidly. After the failed breakout attempts, Soviet resistance has collapsed.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Moscow, May 26th: The official communiqué released tonight stated that our forces on the Kharkiv front have withdrawn to new positions. German forces in the Izyum and Barvenkovo areas, under the cover of large tank units, attempted a fierce offensive, but they were repelled by our forces.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, German Führer Headquarters, May 27th: The German war report this afternoon stated that the surrounded Soviet forces south of Kharkiv are being rapidly annihilated. The enemy has repeatedly attempted to break out without success, and their resistance has been destroyed. General Podlas, commander of the Soviet 57th Army, and his chief of staff committed suicide in a critical situation. Our forces in the central and northern sectors continue to advance and win victories. Two large enemy merchant ships in the port of Murmansk were bombed and caught fire.</p>
<p>Reuters News Agency, Stockholm, May 27th: According to Soviet sources here, Soviet forces on the Izyum-Barvenkovo front have broken through the flanks of the German wedge-shaped positions, cutting off the lines of communication between the leading units of the main German offensive and the rear.</p>
<h3>Soviet Ambassador Litvinov Visits Hull for Lengthy Talks</h3>
<p>Discussing the issue of material transport to the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Reuters News Agency, Washington, May 27th: Soviet Ambassador to the United States Litvinov visited the State Department yesterday morning at the invitation of US Secretary of State Hull. Litvinov then stated that Hull had given him a "document", but did not disclose the nature of the document.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Washington, May 26th: Secretary of State Hull held a two-hour meeting with Soviet Ambassador Litvinov this morning. Afterwards, the Soviet ambassador told reporters that Secretary of State Hull had handed over a "document". It is believed that the "document" is an adjustment plan to coordinate the implementation steps of the current US-Soviet lend-lease agreement with similar agreements that the United States has established with other countries.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Lisbon, May 27th: News from Washington states that Soviet Ambassador to the United States Litvinov held talks with US Secretary of State Hull yesterday for 40 minutes. Political circles in Washington attach great importance to this matter. Litvinov told reporters that he met with Hull at his invitation. A semi-official statement said that the issue of transporting lend-lease materials to the Soviet Union was discussed at the time. It is expected that the Soviet military's launch of a spring offensive was also a topic of discussion.</p>
<p>Draft Content of US-Soviet Agreement</p>
<p>Reuters News Agency, Washington, May 26th: The proposed draft agreement between the Soviet and American governments has been sent to the Soviet government by Soviet Ambassador Litvinov today. It is understood that the draft proposed by the United States is similar in some respects to the agreement established between the United States and Britain this year. The US-Soviet agreement will place the Soviet Union on an equal footing with Britain in terms of US aid, and will give the Soviet Union economic benefits. The Soviet Union can import military supplies and other goods from the United States without having to repay the loans through borrowing or other financial agreements.</p>
<p>Reuters News Agency, Washington, May 27th: President Roosevelt said at a press conference yesterday morning that the "Lend-Lease Act Agreement" given to Soviet Ambassador Litvinov by Secretary of State Hull was only a draft, and its content was almost the same as the Lend-Lease Act agreements concluded by the United States with Britain and other Allied countries. When a reporter asked whether the US-Soviet agreement also involved the post-war commercial relations between the two countries, Roosevelt replied that this agreement was no different from those concluded by the United States with other countries. President Roosevelt spoke about the US military delegation's trip to London, saying that this was another manifestation of the Allied countries' joint operations. When asked whether the arrival of the US military delegation in Britain was related to the recent demands to open a second European battlefield, the president smiled and said, "Maybe it is, maybe it isn't."</p>

<h3>American Military Supplies Continuously Shipped to Turkey</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Ankara, May 26th: As far as is known here, Turkey has been receiving American military supplies on schedule since it signed the lend-lease agreement with the United States in December of last year. As of now, it has received approximately 250 fighter planes, several bombers, a number of heavy artillery pieces, and a batch of light military equipment. Rumors that the United States has proposed to conclude a mutual assistance treaty with Turkey have arisen from this. However, American officials here say that the United States does not consider its aid to Turkey to be in the nature of a mutual assistance treaty. The friendship between the United States and Turkey is indeed strong, but Turkey's benefits from the lend-lease act are no different from those of other countries. Therefore, in the future, the United States has no other demands except to continue shipping military supplies to Turkey according to the agreement.</p>

<h3>Three Factories in Russia Ablaze; Losses Amount to 60 Million Rubles</h3>

Finally, a vegetable oil factory in the vital Danube port of Balella was engulfed in flames following a gas furnace explosion. The factory was destroyed, six workers went missing, and two were severely injured. The fire is still raging, and the estimated loss has reached 30 million rubles. Authorities, viewing the incidents as extraordinary, have initiated separate investigations to determine the cause of the mishaps.</p>
<h3>The Course of Mediterranean Warfare: Cunningham Recounts Three Periods Before His Departure to the U.S.</h3>
<p>London, 26th (Havas): Admiral Cunningham, former commander of the British Mediterranean Fleet, has been appointed by the government as a military attaché to the U.S. and will soon leave for his new post. He recently delivered a radio broadcast here, recounting the course of the Mediterranean warfare. He stated that the Mediterranean war can be divided into three periods. The first period lasted from the outbreak of the European War until Italy's entry. During this time, the situation in the Mediterranean was calm, and the actions of the British Navy were limited to blockading enemy trade. Therefore, most of the Mediterranean Fleet was transferred elsewhere, with only a few old cruisers left for patrol duty. When the German army attacked France, the Allied forces dispatched additional warships through the Strait of Sicily and along the coast of Tunisia to strengthen the Mediterranean defenses. At that time, the majority of the Mediterranean Fleet was composed of French warships, which were highly motivated and fought bravely. The second period was when Germany reinforced the Mediterranean. During this period, the British forces, weakened in strength, adopted a defensive posture. Later, the Germans deployed a large number of aircraft to Italy, gaining air superiority. They also reinforced Libya to fully utilize the land as a base. During this period, both sides bombed each other's bases and communication lines. This marked the third period, and the situation in the Mediterranean remains in this stage. However, British strength has increased, and its position has become more stable.</p>
<h3>Disagreement Within the British Labour Party</h3>
<p>London, 26th (Havas): The 41st Annual Conference of the British Labour Party was held yesterday at the Central Hall of Parliament. 724 delegates from 67 trade unions attended. It is anticipated that the conference will make important decisions, as the delegates aim to determine the political stance of the 2.5 million workers in various industries. It is estimated that the discussion of this matter will take three days. During the first meeting yesterday, the delegates held differing opinions on several important issues, particularly regarding the attitude the Labour Party should adopt toward the government in the current war. Some delegates argued that the Labour Party's concessions in 1940 to join the Churchill cabinet and form a united national government were aimed at ensuring an early British victory. However, as things stand now, the combat situation is not sufficient to compensate for the sacrifices made by the Labour Party. Although the Labour Party's Executive Committee holds twenty seats in the current cabinet, its position is very delicate. Regardless of the government's decisions and actions, Labour Party cabinet members must be accountable to the Labour Party. However, in practice, they have little power to influence all the cabinet's resolutions. Some delegates proposed a motion demanding the government to socialize the arms industry. If the government disagreed, the Labour Party should act freely. However, this motion failed to gain the support of the majority of the delegates and was rejected. In addition, the conference passed two resolutions yesterday. They requested the government to adjust the various modes of transportation in Britain and place them under government control. They also requested the government not to restore the free competition system and disorganized social structure after the war.</p>

<h3>Special Report on Near Eastern Countries</h3>
<p>2.  A General Survey of Turkey (1)</p>
<p>Since the Great War of 1914, there have been three countries whose transformations have been the most dramatic. These have caused people of all nations around the world, regardless of size or power, to feel a sense of shock and dismay. These are Germany, the Soviet Union, and Turkey. Among these, the transformation of Turkey has been the most ear-splitting and mind-numbing, and the purity and singleness of purpose of its revitalizing spirit are most worthy of emulation by weaker nations. Here, we should introduce Turkey to you for your reference.</p>
<p>The Origin of the Nickname "The Sick Man of Europe"</p>
<p>From Chinese history, we can easily find a strange name—the Turkic people (突厥). Anyone who has read Chinese history is probably not unfamiliar with this name. It is said that this race originated from the mixed barbarians (雜胡) of Pingliang. When Cao Cao led his northern expedition to Pingliang, some of these barbarians migrated to the foot of the Altai Mountains, which is the origin of the Turkic people. Later, driven out by the Uyghurs (回紇), some of the Turkic people migrated again to the areas of Arabia and Asia Minor. In the Arabian area, the most notable were the Seljuks (塞爾柱); in Asia Minor, it was the Ottoman (奧托曼) clan, who later founded the Turkish Empire. Both of these Turkic branches had their moment in world history. The Seljuks once fought against seven "Crusades," fighting and killing for almost a hundred years. For a branch of a race to fight against the allied forces of four or five countries and consistently remain on the winning side is no easy feat. At the end of the thirteenth century, an Ottoman came from Asia Minor, and after some effort, became the founding emperor of Turkey. Seeing this episode in history is enough to dispel some of the frustration in our hearts, isn't it?</p>
<p>After founding the country, the Ottomans called themselves Sultan (蘇丹), which is the title for the great emperor of a Muslim country. From this great emperor onwards, a succession of brilliant and capable figures emerged over six to seven hundred years, transforming a small grassland tribe into a great nation that dominated the three continents of Asia, Europe, and Africa. This is something that the mixed barbarians of Pingliang, who were driven away by Cao Cao, would never have dreamed of.</p>
<p>There is no need to detail the piecemeal battles and gradual expansion; let us just say what the situation of Turkey was in the middle of the sixteenth century. Taking everything into account, Turkey at that time could be said to possess North Africa, such as present-day French Algeria, Tunisia, Tripoli, and Egypt; in Asia, it had Arabia, Palestine, Syria, Transjordan, Iraq, and the Transcaucasus; and in Europe, it had the entire Balkan Peninsula, the northern shore of the Black Sea, and the middle reaches of the Danube. At that time, the Black Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, and the Aegean Sea could be said to be within the sphere of Turkish influence. The glorious expansion of a nation reached its peak at this time. It must be understood that the initial capital for such a large territory was merely five hundred households.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "When the sun reaches its zenith, it declines; when the moon is full, it wanes." This is a profound truth. Despite Turkey's success in building such a great enterprise with small capital, it was also in the mid-sixteenth century that a series of misfortunes began. First, Venice and Austria caused trouble. The Ottoman Empire, having reached its peak and begun to decline, had to cede some territory and retreat to southeastern Europe. In the eighteenth century, Russia produced a wise ruler, Peter the Great, who coveted Constantinople, which Turkey had seized from the Eastern Roman Empire. This was the choke point of the Black Sea, so he launched a large-scale southern invasion. As a result, Turkey became somewhat unable to resist, causing the once powerful and domineering empire to decline daily and become helpless. At this time, Turkey was not only militarily weak and its army dispirited, but its internal affairs were also extremely corrupt, with heavy taxes and the people living in misery. Imagine such a vast land, with more than twenty different ethnic groups, each with their own languages and scripts, and different religions. Once the ruler showed signs of collapse, such a combination would naturally lead to a worsening situation and a gradual decline.</p>
<p>Ever since Russia seized Crimea in 1792, the Ottoman Empire began to disintegrate. Serbia and Greece then successively declared independence. In 1875, the Balkans first revolted, and Egypt seceded. As a result, England, France, Russia, Austria, and Italy were constantly "having tea" and "bargaining" with this aging empire in Constantinople, their intentions menacing, as if they were about to carve it up. At this time, there was nothing to say, and the nickname "the sick man of Europe" was easily pinned on Turkey. Until the eve of the outbreak of the Second Balkan War in 1912, Turkey lived a life of sighs and lamentations, never raising its head.</p>
<p>The Italian King Inspects Mountain Troops</p>
<p>Turin, 26th (Havas): During his recent inspection of the north, King Emmanuel III presented ten medals to the flag of the 5th Mountain Brigade, which had performed meritorious service in Greece, to commend them. Afterwards, he held an inspection. As the King and the troops passed through the main streets, the people cheered in salute.</p>

<h3>Subletting Licenses Office No. 4 Is Now Closed; No Extension After the End of This Month; Personnel Have Been Dispatched to Various Districts for Investigation</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Council's subletting licenses began to be issued on April 1st, the following locations were designated: Central District, Room 506, Revenue Division, Shanghai Municipal Council Building; Western District, 378 Avenue Road, 35 Robison Road, 160 Macgregor Road, 1461 Sinza Road, and Jessfield Road; Northern District, 270 North Fujian Road, 130 Haines Road; Eastern District, 132 Chusan Road, 558 Chapoo Road. They were divided into four districts to make it convenient for sublessors to apply nearby. However, by the end of April, only over 30,000 licenses had been issued, which did not match the total of over 60,000 application forms taken. It was inferred that many people had not obtained licenses. Therefore, starting May 1st, an additional half-month extension was granted. However, during the extension period, the number of applicants was still not enthusiastic. Therefore, another half-month extension was granted until the end of this month. During this final extension, many sublessors continued to wait and see. Therefore, the Subletting Housing Management Office has dispatched personnel to the central, western, northern, and eastern districts to conduct strict investigations. Any cases of subletting remaining properties without obtaining a license will be prosecuted and punished after the extension period expires. It is understood that after the final extension at the end of this month, there will be no further extensions. The western district offices on Jessfield Road, Macgregor Road, and Avenue Road, and the northern district office on North Fujian Road, will be closed in order. Therefore, sublessors who have not obtained a license should not let the last four days of the licensing opportunity pass, lest they bring trouble upon themselves.</p>
<h3>Chinese Evacuation Committee Intensifies Evacuation Work by Removing Women</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Evacuation Committee has evacuated over 50,000 people in the two months since it began handling population evacuations. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. The committee's future plans will focus on removing women and children. Supplementary details are provided below. It is necessary to explain the future work situation, especially after the discount coupons were discontinued on May 1st. The committee's work has entered a new stage. Continued Issuance of Return Home Permits: Although the half-price travel discount has been cancelled since May 1st, evacuation work will continue. Although the number of evacuees seems large, it pales in comparison to the total population of the city. Furthermore, given the current situation, living expenses are likely to rise rather than fall. Therefore, citizens returning to their hometowns will continue to do so. To facilitate the permit application process, the committee will continue to entrust various organizations, such as hometown associations, to issue return home permits.</p>
<p>Application for Travel Discounts: Although travel discount coupons have been cancelled, the hardships of poor citizens are taken into account. With the agreement of all relevant parties, groups of 200 or more people preparing to return home can apply to the committee for half-price discounts. Upon receiving the application, it will be approved.</p>
<p>Liaison for Transportation: In addition to applying for half-price discounts, groups of citizens being evacuated to distant and inconvenient destinations can be assisted by the committee in contacting relevant parties for ships to facilitate evacuation work.</p>
<p>Issuance of Temporary Permits: The return home permits issued by the committee can only be used for leaving Shanghai and cannot be used to return to Shanghai. However, some citizens may need to return to their hometowns for important matters or to accompany family members leaving Shanghai and need to return to Shanghai in a short period. To alleviate this difficulty, a temporary permit is issued separately by the committee and the International High Command.</p>
<p>Intensifying Evacuation Work: The work of the past three months can only be described as the beginning of evacuation work and cannot be considered the completion of evacuation work. According to statistics, the industrial and commercial sectors account for 77.5% of evacuees, while other items (including women and children, and the unemployed) account for only 20.1%. It is evident that the past three months focused on the evacuation of the unemployed. In the future, the focus should be on the evacuation of the non-essential unemployed women and children in Shanghai to achieve the ultimate goal of evacuation work. It is planned to strengthen publicity work and encourage citizens who do not need to stay in Shanghai to evacuate quickly.</p>
<h3>Rice Shops in Both Concessions to Sell Popular Rice from Today at 7.6 Yuan per Half Sheng; Applications for Closing Rice Shops to Be Announced Early Next Month</h3>
<p>Yesterday, rice shops in both concessions continued to request rice certificates from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice Management Committee. The soft price of rice in packages was changed to 576 yuan. The rice purchased yesterday will be supplied for sale next week. Rice shops will continue to sell rice today at a retail price of 7.6 yuan per half sheng. Since the total number is over 10,000 bags, the supply situation will be widespread.</p>
<p>Rice shops in both concessions obtained transportation permits on Sunday to extract rice from the Swire, Mitsubishi, and Zhejiang Xingye warehouses. Extraction continued the day before yesterday and was completed yesterday to supply for sale this Sunday. The rice warehouses designated the day before yesterday continue to be Swire, Mitsubishi, and Zhejiang Xingye. The imported rice from these warehouses has already been sold out.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice Management Committee announced that the deadline for allowing closed rice shops to apply for resumption of business in writing has passed. The list of rice shops approved for resumption of business is expected to be announced by the Rice Management Committee early next month. After paying the deposit and being issued a business license for this year, they can begin to resume business. However, the number of rice shops approved for resumption of business is still unknown at this time.</p>
<h3>The Weather Was Dark This Morning in Shanghai; People Could Not Be Recognized Within a Short Distance; All Vehicles Had to Turn on Their Lights</h3>
<p>The weather in Shanghai was suddenly and drastically changed by the low pressure originating from the Yangtze River basin. There were thunderstorms and torrential rain. The wind howled all night before, and the weather was extremely bad. From 9:00 AM to 9:20 AM yesterday, dark clouds gathered, and a dark phenomenon suddenly appeared. People could hardly be recognized within a short distance. Trams and cars turned on their lights to avoid collisions. Such a dark state was rare. Due to the rain and wind, the tide of the Paichiang River rose sharply. Before 3:00 AM yesterday morning, the tide of the Paichiang River inundated the riverbank, and the low-lying roads were flooded with water.</p>
<h3>Transportation Company Manager Arrested for Embezzling Passengers and Goods</h3>
<p>Wu Mingyang, a 51-year-old man from Anhui and manager of the Antrip Travel Agency at 39 Avenue Edward VII, was entrusted by Ma Yan, a merchant residing at 32 Rue Doumer, in February of this year to transport 100 boxes of carbon paper (worth over 5,000 yuan) to Hangzhou. Ma paid Wu a handling fee of 480 yuan, and Wu issued a receipt signed by himself. However, Wu only delivered eight boxes of carbon paper, and the rest were embezzled. After Ma repeatedly urged him without success, Ma had no choice but to complain to the French Concession authorities. An officer was dispatched to summon Wu, but he avoided meeting. Yesterday, Ma Yan led an investigator to point out Wu, who was then brought to justice for investigation.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army and Navy Authorities Decide on Measures to Handle the Four Banks; Central and China Farmers Banks to Remain Closed; China and Communications Banks to Be Reorganized and Reopened</h3>

Specific measures have now been decided. Yesterday (the 27th), the highest commanders of the Japanese army and navy in Shanghai issued a proclamation deciding on the general principles for handling the four banks.

<p>According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, the Russian Catholic Church at 235 Rue Boppe in the French Concession was broken into and looted by thieves late at night on the 24th of this month. The gold and silver parts of the icons were removed, and the wine used for Holy Communion was stolen and drunk. Afterwards, some of the stolen items were found buried in a neighboring garden. When this news was released yesterday, the Russian community in Shanghai expressed shock. According to investigations by the French Concession authorities, the thieves apparently hid in the bushes in the church square on Sunday night, waited for others to leave, and then broke into the building through a window. They acted in a leisurely manner, and all parts of the church were vandalized. The altar was broken, and the silver wreaths on the icons were removed. A gold Christ figure was removed from a silver cross. A treasure of the church, a piece of the true cross given by the Roman Church, was also missing. In addition, various gold and silver utensils were stolen. The thieves also found the wine used for Holy Communion and drank heavily on the spot, spilling a lot on the ground. Later, the church leader, Father Fedor, discovered the theft and reported it to the French police. Investigators were dispatched to investigate and found some of the stolen goods in a neighboring garden, presumably temporarily buried because they could not be carried away.</p>
<h3>Columbia Road: A Glimpse of the Christian Refugee Children's Home - Sheltering a Total of Forty-Eight Suffering Children, Completely Ruralizing Their Lives Away from the City</h3>
<p>The Christian Refugee Children's Home on Jiangjia Lane, Columbia Road in this city has been established for two years. It shelters displaced refugee children. The initial organizer was Miss Main, an American missionary. When American nationals evacuated from Shanghai this spring, the operation was taken over by local church members Li Baiqiang, Huang Lanyu, Xu Shaodi, and others who established a board of directors to continue its maintenance.</p>
<p>Mixed Vegetable Garden</p>
<p>The Christian Refugee Children's Home is located at the end of Columbia Road in a place called Jiangjia Hui, far from the bustling city, presenting a completely rural scene. At the entrance of Jiangjia Lane, a stone bridge spans a river pond. Crossing the bridge leads directly to the home, with beautiful scenery. The site occupies two and a half acres. In the center is a row of seven single-story houses, each divided into two, making fourteen rooms. The area around the single-story houses is spacious, with a mixed vegetable garden.</p>
<p>Home Facilities</p>
<p>The central single-story houses contain classrooms, bedrooms, bathrooms, dining rooms, and so on. The bedrooms occupy two large rooms, one for boys and one for girls. The girls' bedroom has ten bunk beds, each divided into two levels, accommodating twenty people. The boys' bedroom has twelve beds, accommodating twenty-four people, and there are also two iron beds, accommodating five or six people. Each bunk is neatly furnished with clean cotton bedding. At the north end of the bedrooms, there are wooden shelf racks for the refugee children to place their washbasins and toiletries. Each person is assigned a number, creating an orderly arrangement.</p>
<p>Refugee Children's Origins</p>
<p>The home has accommodated up to fifty refugee children at its peak. Recently, several have been taken away by family members due to the departure of metal industries from Shanghai. Currently, there are still forty-eight children being cared for. The statistics of their origins are as follows: Shaoxing nine, Ningbo seven, Northern Jiangsu eight, Shandong three, Anhui four, Shanghai three, Fujian four, Guangdong two, Nanjing one, others seven. The oldest is sixteen years old, the youngest seven years old. The director Ms. Zhao Aiguang (from Nanjing) and the teacher Ms. Chen Shaojing (from Anhui) are responsible for their management and education.</p>
<p>Daily Life</p>
<p>The daily life of the refugee children is as follows: waking up at 6:00 AM, washing, tidying up the bedrooms, doing morning prayers, and then having breakfast. After breakfast, older boys go to the garden to hoe, cultivate, or plant vegetables. At 9:00 AM, they attend classes or engage in other extracurricular activities. At 12:00 PM, they have lunch. In the afternoon, they continue with classes as usual. At 5:30 PM, they have dinner. However, all three meals consist of thin porridge, mixed with vegetables picked from the garden. Sometimes, plain white porridge is served, accompanied by self-grown broad beans and other side dishes, resembling the life of a farming family, with a unique flavor.</p>
<p>Thorough Nurturing</p>
<p>Every Saturday afternoon, classes are suspended for the refugee children to take baths. Water is taken from the well in the garden, heated, and used. On Sundays, the director leads them to nearby churches for worship. Therefore, their lives are completely collectivized. The director is like a parent, and the teachers are like nannies, creating a harmonious and joyful atmosphere.</p>
<p>Financial Difficulties</p>
<p>However, the most troubling issue for the home's organizers is the financial problem. Because the home has neither a foundation nor regular funding, monthly expenses rely entirely on the board of directors' fundraising, especially for food. Even with thin porridge for three meals, it still requires four bags of rice per month, costing 1,600 yuan. If this continues, it will not only be difficult to sustain but also make it harder to realize plans to expand the accommodation of suffering children. Therefore, they earnestly hope that benevolent individuals will offer assistance and welcome visits to the home. The home's mailing address is c/o Mr. Ji Baiqiang, 422 Hankou Road, or c/o Mr. Xu Shaoshan, 125 Hankou Road.</p>

<h3>Paper Store Robbery</h3>
<p>Hongxing Paper Store at No. 23, Lane 727 (i.e., Taian Lane), North Shanxi Road, Tiantong Road, was robbed at 9:00 PM on the 26th (the day before yesterday). The store had closed, and two trainees were guarding the entrance. Unexpectedly, around 10:00 PM, two robbers knocked on the door. The trainees inside asked who it was. The robbers outside falsely claimed to be members of the self-defense corps, saying they needed to borrow the telephone for urgent business. The trainees believed them and opened the door. The two robbers rushed in, closed the door tightly, and one robber guarded it. At this time, the trainees realized they were not dealing with good people and refused to let the robbers enter the store. The robbers then took out a pistol, threatened them into silence, and used ropes to tie up the two trainees, stuffing their mouths with cotton. The two robbers then searched the premises and stole 1,500 yuan in legal tender from the drawer before fleeing. It was not until yesterday morning when the store manager arrived that the robbery was discovered. He immediately reported it to the police, who sent detectives to investigate and pursue the case.</p>
<h3>Swindlers - Using the Pretext of Business Partnership to Deceitfully Obtain Wealth</h3>
<p>Ying Liangqin, a salesman at the Meixin Printing House on Tiantong Road, was introduced to Xu Zhiping from Shaoxing. It was found that Xu was a member of a swindling gang, specializing in deceiving and acquiring wealth. After getting acquainted with Ying, they immediately met. In mid-May, Xu claimed that a certain person on Kangti Road in the French Concession had 1,000 dozens of socks, valued at 60,000 yuan, urgently wanting to sell them at a low price. He asked Ying to invest in a partnership, with each share being 10,000 yuan. Ying agreed and arranged to meet at Room 525, China Hotel on Guizhou Road, on the afternoon of the 19th of this month to hand over the money. When Ying arrived with 3,000 yuan (including a 2,000 yuan check from the Continental Bank) at the China Hotel, there were four other people in the room besides Xu: Xu Jinlin, Jin Xigen, Dai Yansheng, and Yu Asi. Xu Zhiping then said that the owner of the socks had not yet arrived, and to kill time, he enticed Ying to gamble (press treasure), promoting Ying as the dealer, claiming he could guarantee wins. At the same time, these people took out a rattan basket, revealing that it was filled with banknotes, approximately tens of thousands of yuan (except for the top and bottom notes being genuine, the rest were made of newsprint). Ying believed it to be true and joined the game as the dealer. Unexpectedly, he lost every bet, and within half an hour, the 3,000 yuan in legal tender was completely lost. Ying then realized he had been deceived and reported it to the General Police Station. Chinese detective Xian Chengming went and brought Xu and the other five people, along with gambling tools and fake notes, to the police station. A 2,000 yuan Continental Bank check was found on Jin Xigen, and another 1,000 yuan in cash was taken away by an accomplice named Liu Bangcai. They were ordered to be detained for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Amidst the Serious Food Shortage, Advocate Planting Sweet Potatoes - Written by Yu Jingmei of the Lester Institute</h3>
<p>The sweet potato, also known as sweet yam, is commonly called "bai shu" in the north. In the "Compendium of Materia Medica," it is listed under the vegetable section, mainly used to replenish deficiency, benefit energy, strengthen the spleen and stomach, fortify kidney yin, and prolonged consumption is beneficial to health. According to its described functions, it is indeed a harmless and beneficial food. At this time of serious food shortage, various doctrines about this product are collected and introduced to those who study food and care about people's livelihoods for reference. Shape: It is a vegetable plant with slender stems that creep on the ground. Its leaves are oval or heart-shaped with long petioles, arranged alternately. The flowers are fused corollas, shaped like morning glories but smaller in size and purple in color. Its tubers are fleshy and used for food. Taste: Sweet and palatable. Origin: The species originally came from the South Pacific Islands, hence the name "sweet potato." It was first introduced to Guangdong and Fujian, and now it is found everywhere. Various Descriptions in Old Books: "Grass Records of the South" states, "It is produced in Zhuyai. The people in the sea do not farm, but dig and plant sweet potatoes. They harvest in autumn, steam and dry them, cutting them into grain-like pieces. They store them in barns as food rations. This is called 'sweet potato grain.' Generally, among southerners with gray hair, there are very few, only one or two out of a hundred. However, people in the sea live over a hundred years because they do not eat grains but eat sweet potatoes." "Records of Strange Things" states, "Sweet potatoes come from Jiaoguang. Southern families plant them in February and harvest them in October. Their roots are similar to taro, and some are very large, the largest being like goose eggs, and the smallest like chicken eggs. After peeling off the purple skin, the flesh is as white as fat. Southerners consider it as grain and fruit. Su Dongpo once said that Hainan uses sweet potatoes as grain, about one-sixteenth of the amount of rice. Now, it is the same in northern Hainan." Xu Xuanhu said that sweet potatoes have thirteen advantages: 1. One mu yields dozens of shi; 2. Its white color and sweet taste are particularly outstanding among all soils; 3. It benefits people, with the same function as taro; 4. It spreads everywhere, propagated by cutting stems; one stem this year can plant hundreds of mu next year; 5. Its branches and leaves cling to the ground, and the nodes grow roots, so wind and rain cannot damage it; 6. It can be used as grain, so famine years cannot harm it; 7. It can supply border areas; 8. It can be used to make wine; 9. It can be stored for a long time, and when ground, it can be made into cakes, better than sugar and honey; 10. It can be eaten raw or cooked; 11. It requires less land and yields more benefits, and it is easy to irrigate; 12. It is planted in spring and summer, and harvested in early winter. Its branches and leaves are very lush, and grass cannot grow, but it requires loose soil and does not require plowing, without hindering agricultural work; 13. Its roots are deep in the soil, and even if the seedlings are eaten to the end, they can still grow, and locusts cannot do anything about it. Components: The following table shows the percentage of sweet potato components analyzed using scientific methods by a nutrition expert: Water 72.25, Protein 1.08, Fat 0.19, Carbohydrates 21.49, Fiber 1.37, Calories 94, Ash 0.62, Phosphorus 0.06, Iron 0.0006, Potassium 0.194, Vitamins A, B, C, D are all abundant. This table is based on the experimental data in the book "Foods of Shanghai" and is provided for readers' reference. (Note: The book "Foods of Shanghai" is written by a certain nutrition expert.) Planting Method: Plant sweet potatoes in high sandy land, raising ridges more than a foot high, and planting on the ridges. Plow deeply before the end of the year and fertilize with manure. Plant after the vernal equinox. Cut the sweet potato roots into three or four-inch lengths, cover them with soil half an inch deep. Space each plant seven or eight feet vertically and two or three feet horizontally. When the vines have grown vigorously and the seedlings are a zhang long, leave two feet as old roots, and cut the remaining three leaves into sections, inserting them into the soil. Plant each seedling one foot apart, approximately two-thirds of the seedling should be buried in the soil, and one-third should be exposed, so that it can grow again. Cut and plant as it grows, and the spread is no different from the original planting. When planting sweet potatoes, they must be planted upright; if planted upside down, they will not grow. Knots above the soil will grow branches, and knots below the soil will grow tubers. Approximately each knot grows roots, and then cut them off at their connection points, so that each forms roots and seedlings. Each knot can yield three to five tubers. All vines that have spread everywhere and cannot be contained are called "wandering vines" and should be pruned. When digging the roots, the rolled vines can all be used to feed cattle, sheep, and pigs, or dried to feed them in winter, which can fatten them. Those planted in February or March require two and a half steps of land per plant, and the tubers will spread. Approximately thirty-six plants are planted per mu. Those planted in April or May require two steps of land, and the tubers will spread. Approximately sixty plants per mu. Those planted in June require one and a half steps of land, and the tubers will spread, approximately one hundred and six plants per mu. Those planted in July require three feet of land or less, and the tubers will be small. Approximately nine hundred and sixty plants per mu. The density of planting can be adjusted according to the circumstances. Those planted in ridges in September will grow tubers like chopsticks. Consider using them as seeds. This is the Songjiang method.</p>
<p>Overall, based on the above new and old doctrines, sweet potatoes are undoubtedly a beneficial food. In the current situation of severe food shortages, we should advocate planting more of this product, which is also a way to remedy the food shortage.</p>
<h3>Three Orphanages Stage a Play to Raise Funds</h3>
<p>The Ciji Children's Home at the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Qipu Road in Shanghai is jointly operated by the Charity Organization United Disaster Relief Association and the Jisheng Association, sheltering over two hundred poor children. The Jingye Orphanage on Avenue Haig, operated by the Jingye Society, houses over one hundred people, and the Disaster Relief Children's Home on Rue Courbet houses over two hundred people. None of them have foundations and rely entirely on donations. Recently, the cost of living has increased daily, making it difficult to maintain them. Now, prominent philanthropists such as Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, and Huang Jinrong have initiated and invited renowned amateur opera singers Fei Jianlong and Sun Junqing, as well as famous performers Huang Guiqiu, Lin Shusen, and Cao Huilin, to perform a charity performance on the afternoon of the 30th of this month at the Grand Theater. Ticket prices are divided into four types: 20 yuan, 10 yuan, 5 yuan, and 1 yuan. The proceeds from the ticket sales, after deducting expenses, will be allocated to the above three organizations as funding. Shanghai is not lacking in knowledgeable music lovers and philanthropists. Listening to elegant music and planting blessings, they will surely enthusiastically support and contribute to this charitable cause.</p>
<h3>Good News for Addicts</h3>

For all deeply entrenched addictions to opium, heroin, etc., whether smoked or injected, he can achieve the goal of safe and thorough withdrawal. At a time when everything is rising in price and life is difficult, having such a good drug rehabilitation hospital is truly good news for addicts.</p>

<h3>European Director Gao Tianlun Wanders Thousands of Miles to Shanghai (Part 2) - Discovering the Alluring Star Marlene Dietrich and Single-Handedly Handling a Puppet Troupe in Half a Year</h3>
<p>Gao Tianlun has a considerable position in the European film industry. His Western puppet troupe has performed several times in this city. Unfortunately, the dialogue and lyrics are all in German, and only a few can appreciate them. It is said that the English script has been translated, and probably next time this novel thing will be performed in English.</p>
<p>Our reporter recently visited this wandering European film director. His residence and the expression when directing the puppet show were seen in yesterday's newspaper. What is recorded here is how he discovered the big star Marlene Dietrich and the struggles after fleeing east:</p>
<p>Discovering Marlene Dietrich</p>
<p>"This is a film Marlene and I co-produced in Saint-Gill - (a famous resort area in southern Austria) in the spring of 1937" - (pictured in yesterday's newspaper). Mr. Gao Tianlun finally found it from a pile of photos. Then, he happily told the story of how he discovered her.</p>
<p>He said that it was about 1925 when he was working at Tobis Sacha Film Co. One time, everyone in the film studio had left, but the boss wanted to make a film that needed a very lively female character. Among the many young women who applied, he found a girl with bright eyes, white teeth, a slender figure, and curly hair, who later became known as the naturally charming and alluring star Ms. Marlene Dietrich.</p>
<p>"What kind of play did she perform in?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Cafe Electrie - Electrical Hotel." He thought for a while and opened the "old account book" from seventeen years ago before he could remember the name.</p>
<p>Marlene Dietrich often played the charming and moving hostess in movies, which shows that it was "a long time coming."</p>
<p>Gao Tianlun gave a "close-up" of the scene when he met Marlene in Saint-Gill. His happy expression is difficult for my clumsy pen to describe.</p>
<p>Twenty-Seven Years of Film Work</p>
<p>In the various actions of smoking, laughing wildly, sighing, and meditating, Gao Tianlun relived his old dream of making films in various parts of Europe. From his conversation, I learned some of his past life:</p>
<p>He was born in Vienna on June 15, 1895, received a considerable education, and is married. He began working in the film industry in 1914. He has been to Berlin, Munich, Prague, Budapest, Brussels, and London, all working in film studios. He fled Vienna in 1939, stayed in Paris for a while, and then went to Manila. He signed a five-year contract with a local Meniver Film Company. That musical romance film "Huling Pagheha" - (meaning the last tears) is said to have sold very well. He left the Philippines and came to Shanghai in mid-June last year. Because of the incident, he had to live a dull life in Shanghai. And that film called "Sunlight," all the preparation plans had to be completely shelved. Gao Tianlun, according to himself, designed, directed, edited, and produced a total of 296 films of all sizes in twenty-seven years.</p>
<p>When Gao Tianlun talked about the filming in Manila, his spirit was very nervous at first. He showed me newspaper reviews, records, head lists, promotional materials, etc., and almost no printed matter did not have the A. Gottlein name. Finally, he turned over the thick three volumes of dialogue scripts of the "Sunlight" play, which took a lot of effort but was completely in vain. The inside was in German, English, and Filipino. There were also complete lists of roles, scene drawings, and set descriptions, all piled high on top of these three huge volumes of scripts. His voice became lower and lower, and his expression became more and more sluggish; it was like the "fade-out" method in movies. Finally, he said weakly to me:</p>
<p>"Sir, it's all over!" (At this point, everyone was silent, only raindrops hitting the glass window)</p>
<p>Struggling in the Loft</p>
<p>"Then you have to think of some way!" I said.</p>
<p>It was as if he woke up again, and both eyes gradually shone again.</p>
<p>"Puppet show," he raised his voice, leaning his upper body on the desk, and said to me face to face.</p>
<p>"In seven or eight months, I personally made those puppets; I also personally trained the puppeteers, teaching them how to move the puppets on stage! We also practiced dialogue in this room all day and night, matching the music. All the sets, props, lighting, curtains, etc. were all made by ourselves. You know, sir, if we left it to others, how could we manage with such a small amount of capital?"</p>
<p>In his five-minute self-report, I felt that this person who had twenty-seven years of film directing experience had erased everything in the past in an uncontrollable environment and with bare hands! He took several large film companies with millions of capital, dozens of stars he had directed, thousands of film practitioners... shrank... shrank... shrank - and became a puppet troupe. He moved the spirit of the big directors like "camera," "cut," etc. from the hundreds of square feet of film studio to the "loft" to direct those eighteen-inch-high rows of puppets. Was he decadent? No. Was he disappointed? No. Was he satisfied? No.</p>
<p>Leaving Gao Tianlun's residence on Avenue Albert, I got these three impressions.</p>
<h3>Qianghua Changes Today to Fight Xuhui - 5:00 PM at Xuhui Public School Field Yesterday's Game Against Hequn Rained Out</h3>
<p>The Qianghua football team was originally scheduled to play against the Hequn mini-football team yesterday at the Donghua Field on Route Pichon, but unfortunately, the weather was not good, and it rained all day, so the game could not be played. This game was decided to be canceled and rescheduled to play against the Xuhui team at the Xuhui Public School Field at 3:00 PM today. After the game, the team will leave Shanghai. Qianghua was poisoned by Zhou Tang the day before yesterday. This time, they are determined to win the final victory against Xuhui. The Xuhui team has good players such as Yu Liming and Gao Zhiwen.

<h3>A Sudden Reversal in Government Bonds</h3>
<p>Yesterday's unofficial market for government bonds experienced a sudden reversal. At the opening, bid prices varied, with sellers asking low and buyers bidding high, creating considerable confusion. Initially, Hongxing bought in, followed by Yitai, Runde, and Xinji, who also absorbed a significant amount. However, aggressive selling led to an oversupply on the table, causing repeated fluctuations before ultimately trending sharply downwards. Class C bonds nearly hit the lower limit, but fortunately, Tongshun and Tongkang provided support, preventing it. After two days of hitting the upper limit, this reversal was expected. Long-term thinking still sees no reason to underestimate them; it was merely a temporary release of some floating long positions. Class A bonds broke the 70-yuan mark, with Defu selling small amounts and Tongli continuing to sell broadly. Dechang, Jiufeng, Hengfu, Huichang, Hongda, Tongyuan, Jiufu, and general retail investors all closed out their floating long positions. Buyers included the aforementioned firms, as well as Dazhong, Yongchang, Shunli, Yongkang, and various retail investors, making it extremely lively. The temporary reversal is insignificant; after all, buying now includes two periods' worth of interest. The market results showed a uniform decline of 1.5 to 3.7 yuan, with approximately 3 million yuan in transactions. A simplified table is listed below:</p>

<h3>Bargains Attract Buyers, Cotton Cloth Rises Again in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for factory-made cloth initially fell before rising, with prices for various cloths trending upwards. Holders of Blue Mark goods absorbed bargains without hesitation, a now-common psychology. In the morning, a small number of coarse and fine cloths were released due to tight money, falling by over ten yuan per bolt. The noon closing already showed stabilization.

<h3>Corn and Bean Cakes: Re-entered on Dips</h3>
<p>The bean market yesterday started flat and then strengthened.

Subsequently, bargain hunters emerged, and the market recovered slightly, but the final result was still seven or eight yuan lower than before. Four truckloads of Wuhu corn were sold at 188 yuan to 192 yuan delivered.</p>

Sales included 700 bags of Sanxin small package bran, September end warehouse orders, at 140 yuan to 148 yuan.</p>
<h3>Golden Needles Costly</h3>
<p>The stock of dried lily flowers in various producing areas is depleted, but according to letters, there is still inventory of Tianjin Datong brand.

<p>Bitter almonds previously experienced weak sales, and the value of goods was soft, falling by about 100 yuan. However, with recent dramatic financial changes, prices have rebounded, with varying bids. If calculated based on the Tianjin exchange rate, it is difficult to transfer to Shanghai, so the market is very tight.</p>
<h3>Dried Scallops: Prices Vary Even More</h3>
<p>Due to the high discount rate for drafts, the market for dried scallops is rising accordingly. Upon investigation, the production price for shipments to Shanghai varies even more, so selling prices have increased repeatedly. Yesterday's sale orders (drafts) were approximately 5,200 yuan for New Light small dried scallops, 5,000 yuan for medium, and 4,900 yuan for triangular.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes: Easy to Rise, Hard to Fall</h3>
<p>The cigarette market trend remains firm. Yesterday, due to financial stability, confidence temporarily stabilized. Overall, trading was quite brisk, because the factory price is still far from the market price, so major national firms are still holding onto their stocks.

Old Knife brand 9,000 yuan, Pin Hai brand 7,000 (illegible), Five China brand 5,700 yuan, Little Fairy brand 6,500 yuan. The above prices had slight fluctuations.

<h3>Longan (6)</h3>
<p>— Gao Jianchen</p>
<p>The season for picking longans is approximately after the White Dew solar term. Zhou Liangong's "Minor Chronicles of Fujian" says: "Longan branches are very soft and brittle. When ripe, experienced pickers are hired, fearing that they will eat too much. They are hired with the agreement: 'Sing without stopping. If you stop, you will not be paid.' The leaves are lush, people sit in the green shade, singing softly up and down continuously, which is quite pleasing to hear from afar. The locals call it 'singing longans.'" What a poetic and rustic scene this is! When picking, a small amount of stems and leaves must be attached for long-term storage. As for the method of roasting, the "Complete Treatise on Agriculture" says: "After picking, soak them in plum (illegible) for a night, take them out to dry in the sun, and then roast them with fire until the pits are dry and hard... Dried clusters are called Longan Brocade." The "Tropical Fruit Tree Cultivation Method" says: "... Often after picking, cut off the branches and soak them in a water tank for about ten minutes; then use bamboo (illegible) and fine sand to shake them, rubbing their shells, turning them from rough to smooth.... Pour them onto the roasting stove to roast... The roasting should be done with low heat, not high heat, to prevent burning the shell. Turn them every four hours or so, and they will be dry after twenty hours. It is necessary to skillfully observe the heat.... After roasting, trim them flat, and shake them in a bamboo (illegible) with (illegible) yellow to evenly coat the shell with yellow color to prevent moths.... Large particles are called 'Official Second,' larger ones are called 'Baldy,' and even larger ones are called 'Big Third,' each box containing fifty catties. Smaller ones are called 'Baldy Second,' and even smaller ones are called 'Xingji,' each box containing sixty catties...."</p>
<p>Worldly matters, just like "the world is imperfect" to be itself, longans, whose "flesh is as clear and white as crystal balls" - as described in "Wuxun Miscellaneous Jade" - are of course no exception: the various pests that destroy longans include the longan beetle, which specializes in eating flower buds during flowering, and white (illegible) worms and black ants, which build nests in the fruit and suck the juice. As for what the "Minor Chronicles of Fujian" says: "In the middle of the longan ripening season, there are flying thieves who specialize in stealing, climbing grafted trees, agile as the wind, like giant bandits: in an instant, thousands of trees are hunted without anyone noticing, called 'nightingales.'... We cannot imagine what kind of creatures these are!..."</p>
<p>The final conclusion is: Most of the sweet, delicious, and beneficial plants for mankind have flourished and spread all over the world, but longans - and lychees, etc. - are still confined to southern Asia and have not ventured far from home. This is not because they lack the qualifications to compete with other fruits, but because they lack a powerful confidant to lend a hand! Now "dried" longans are gradually emerging in major European and American cities. Further cultivation and broadcasting may not take too long (End).

<h3>Rough Emotions</h3>
<p>— Lei Ruohua</p>
<p>As a story, sadness can weave into a moving plot; as a drama, it can win the audience's sympathy and tears; but as life, it is just a kind of misfortune, a kind of corrosive. In such days, sadness is already a shame.</p>
<p>One day, a friend told me that he had become wild. At the time, I was silent, but afterwards I often remembered this sentence. Perhaps everyone has such a time: his nerves are sensitive, his emotions are fragile; encountering a stimulus, he becomes a bit hysterical; not as he wishes, tears flow like a spring. He is a sparrow, hiding in his own nest.</p>
<p>It is only those who live a difficult life, who have been tempered and honed, and who can still live bravely, whose emotions become rough. He will not sigh, he will not be sad, he will not sit in a corner of a small building listening to the sound of rain, he will not recite verses about spring flowers and autumn moons. He clenches his teeth, he supports himself. He remembers life, he thinks about life, he wants to live on.</p>
<p>The roughness of emotion is a kind of learning, a kind of worthwhile learning. The wings of a sparrow become hard and it wants to fly far away, and if a person is honest, what is even more important is to be honest with oneself; you may have reasons to deceive others, but on what basis do you want to deceive yourself?</p>
<p>The weather is getting hotter, and summer is coming, do you think winter is far away? Is winter a thing of the past? Do you say that between seasons, it seems like something is missing? Then, how can you say to people again, "Come, let's talk about thrushes, talk about roses, talk about beautiful eyes, and the smiles of youth"? We have this kind of weather!</p>
<p>Become a little wilder, become a little rougher.</p>
<h3>A Child's Life</h3>
<p>— Ling Xiao</p>
<p>During the great storm, I didn't notice the destruction of a small life. After my child died, I often thought like this.</p>
<p>Although surrounded by countless tragedies that I can't remember or count, although reason warned me not to resent afterwards things that were worth regretting earlier, although I understand that the losses of the unrecoverable past will be difficult to compensate.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is selfish: I love my recently deceased child. Especially because of poverty and hardship, I felt that I should give the child too little; no, this was controlled by a terrible force, depriving me of the opportunity to give the child anything possible.</p>
<p>My child was eight years old. Coming to Shanghai from my hometown, he lost everything he should have and needed: nutrition, happiness, suffocated in a small building, constantly exposed to sad faces, and even subjected to the irritable violence of his elders. The child was a little sensible, he could no longer support this kind of excessively heavy persecution, and illness began. The fight against the disease requires the acquisition of money and time, these two pillars.</p>
<p>The child was sick for a full three months, and the condition changed a lot. "If it's serious, let's go to the doctor!" "If it's easier, it's probably not serious, so we can wait a few days and make a decision." Sometimes, mental troubles and the hardships of life made me grasp the reason for self-abandonment: "What will the child do when he grows up?"</p>
<p>It wasn't until the terrible symptoms appeared on the child that fear, panic, regret, and resentment made me taste the unbearable bitterness of life. The child's shouting, fainting, and the pale and haggard appearance after stopping breathing, my wife's crying, friends' consolation, I changed from nervous thoughts to numbness, trance, regret, and even emptiness.</p>
<p>Now I deeply feel lonely. My heart is sinking, my brain is convulsing, and I often want to discard the sad memory, every scene, everything that is connected with the child, I pull into my brain and chew on it as much as possible. Until I am in pain, I shed tears, as if my sin of being unable to protect the child has been punished as it deserves, I am suddenly lost and regain my reason.</p>
<p>In this world, there should be nothing cheaper than life. My child is just a sacrificial item in this auction. It is such a common phenomenon for a wave to dissipate in a large whirlpool. I cannot protect my child personally, but how can I protect myself?</p>
<p>But, I understand that the world will eventually allow this kind of love for children.</p>
<h3>Ruminant "Characters"</h3>
<p>— Xia Jiuding</p>
<p>The great German philosopher Nietzsche, in his "Thus Spoke Zarathustra," said: "How precious it would be if people had ruminant organs in their stomachs!" (This is the general meaning; the original book has been sold to a pancake shop to exchange for pancakes.) People have rumination. Only cattle and horses have this thing.</p>
<p>If people had rumination, what would be the benefit? Nietzsche's original intention is beyond the comprehension of ordinary people, but perhaps the reason is as follows:</p>
<p>Our human enemy is the "stomach": the stomach digests our food and makes us want to eat again after eating. It is simply impossible not to eat. For the sake of eating, all social problems and international incidents follow one after another. Tracing back, isn't it caused by the "stomach"?</p>
<p>A large number of scientists are trying their best to deal with this "stomach," but apart from some news reports, such as "anti-hunger pills" and "special rations," I have not seen any factual manifestations. Once a clever person said: "Wouldn't it be good to inject the air needle for lung disease into the stomach?" No, first, each air needle costs 30 yuan (note: a new legal tender), equivalent to a large dish, which is not suitable for the masses; second, wouldn't a stomach full of air "anger" people to death, even before they could wait for the peace meal? What to do? The best thing is rumination!</p>
<p>Close your eyes and imagine: put the rice down and put it in the ruminant sac; the "stomach" wants to come and plunder it, don't give it; hungry, let it go, don't even need to tighten the waistband; hungry, let it starve for three days, and then return a little from the sac to satisfy the "stomach's" greed; go on like this like "cowhide candy," applying the war of attrition to the digestive function. One meal can last for at least ten days, and leveling rice can be a little more comfortable.</p>
<h3>Free Talk Adds a "Talk Box"</h3>
<p>This column now plans to add a "Talk Box" column, soliciting experts or ordinary professionals from all walks of life to reveal the content and secrets of their professions, and describe their personal service opinions and feelings, so that general readers can have a deeper understanding and more correct understanding of various special professions. The number of words should be around 3,000 as the most ideal, and please divide them into paragraphs for publication in installments. Except for specially commissioned articles, contributions from all walks of life are welcome.</p>
<h3>The Memory of Great Men</h3>
<p>— Jing Ji</p>
<p>America's most famous botanist, Asa Gray, was able to remember the names of 25,000 plants; Caesar could also remember the names of tens of thousands of his trusted soldiers.</p>
<p>Charlie Chaplin has had a personal secretary who has been with him for seven years, but strangely, according to that secretary, Chaplin still doesn't know his surname.</p>
<p>The famous English poet Byron boasted that he could recite all the poems he had written; but on the contrary, Walter Scott had a really bad memory, he would even forget the poems he had written himself; he once mistakenly thought his own work was written by Byron, and praised it enthusiastically!</p>
<p>The English philosopher Bacon could dictate one of his famous works entirely from memory, without a single mistake; but the American stage star Joseph Jefferson, even after playing "Rip Van Winkle" for thirteen years, still often forgot his lines.</p>
<p>The memory of the British historical authority Macaulay is truly in line with the Chinese saying: "Read ten lines at a glance, and never forget what you've seen!" He could recite any chapter of a book after reading it only once. He wrote many historical masterpieces, but never used any reference books.</p>
<p>The memory of the old American President Roosevelt was also worth praising. When meeting guests, he liked to pay attention to the details, appearance, or actions of the guests. Once he met you, he would never forget you again! When he saw you a second time, he would immediately call you by your name. Once, he met a Japanese banker whom he had not seen for fifteen years, and what surprised the Japanese banker the most was that in the instant they met, he started talking about something they had discussed during their first meeting fifteen years ago!</p>
<p>Lincoln told us a "memory secret": Whenever you want to remember something firmly, you might as well read it aloud, so that sight and hearing can work at the same time.</p>
<h3>Eucalyptus Trees</h3>
<p>— Hua Shi</p>
<p>A giant tree produced in Australia, called the eucalyptus tree, is currently attracting the attention of scientists because the oil extracted from the leaves of this tree can be used as fuel.</p>
<p>After many experiments, eucalyptus oil can replace petroleum for any purpose.</p>
<p>This oil has a very high calorific value and is comparable to gasoline. The results of its use are very satisfactory: a car travels twenty-four miles per gallon of gasoline. If eucalyptus oil is mixed with gasoline, one gallon can travel twenty-eight miles. If one gallon of eucalyptus oil is used alone, the car can travel thirty-six miles.</p>
<p>Dr. Dee said that when this oil is mixed with gasoline, kerosene, or alcohol, the engine will not be fouled frequently.</p>
<p>Approximately one thousand catties of leaves can be refined into twenty-five catties of oil, and the method is very simple.</p>
<p>In addition to Australia, northern Africa, such as Algeria, also produces it, but it has not yet been adopted and utilized.</p>
<h3>Strabismus Corrector</h3>
<p>— Yong Yun</p>
<p>The eyes, like other organs in the human body, need exercise. A device controlled by electricity has recently been invented that can correct strabismus and can also be used as an instrument for general eye exercises. This type of corrector is not a gimmick used by quack doctors to swindle money, and has been repeatedly tested with significant effectiveness.</p>
<h3>The Maori of New Zealand</h3>
<p>— Ma Lan</p>
<p>Most of the world's remaining primitive indigenous peoples are gradually declining, but the Maori of New Zealand are an exception. All anthropologists agree that the cultural level of the Maori is indeed higher than that of other primitive peoples. And their achievements are indeed better than others. They also occupy several seats in the New Zealand Parliament. But what is most puzzling is the question of their origin.</p>
<p>New Zealand is a point in the vast and boundless Pacific Ocean, and it is the only long-term home of the Maori. Although there are similar types of people on other islands in the Pacific, their cultural characteristics are not the same.</p>
<p>The question of the origin of the Maori may never be solved, because there is no conclusive evidence. But some people think they came from India. This theory cannot be believed with certainty, but it cannot be disbelieved either.</p>
<p>We have reason to believe that the Maori initially lived near the Caspian Sea and were white Caucasians. Thousands of years ago, they invaded India via the northwest. Gradually, the Caucasians mixed with the Indians. As a result of population growth, they moved to Myanmar, and then through various islands to Java. Then they passed the northern coast of Australia and reached New Zealand. What is most puzzling is that the vast northern Australian coast did not attract their attention.</p>
<p>The motive for this migration originated from population expansion, and this movement continued for thousands of years. About five hundred years ago, they discovered New Zealand. Before that, they had lived on various islands in the Pacific and were famous navigators. White people did not arrive in New Zealand until after the great migration of the Maori had ended. However, they came from behind and built their own new world. The total population of the entire territory is about one million, which is still not comparable to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Sharing Weal and Woe</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(Five) Reciprocity</p>
<p>The house suddenly became lively again. Wei Cheng caught sight of Guo Fang and quickly asked, "Where is Sister Cui Zhen?" Guo Fang said, "Follow me." Wei Cheng followed Guo Fang to the outside of Cui Zhen's sleeping room. Wei Cheng said, "Isn't she sleeping in Aunt's room?" Guo Fang pointed to the note on the door frame for him to see and shook his head. Wei Cheng read it and said, "You wrote this. Thank you for your great concern for her." Guo Fang smiled and said, "I also wanted to say these words on her behalf, but you said them first. She is lying down now and doesn't need anyone to comfort her. Let me ask you, do you know if Cui Zhen's uncle and uncle's daughter have returned here from the cemetery?" Wei Cheng said, "Huh! Why are you asking about this? Did Sister Cui Zhen ask you to ask?" Guo Fang was really afraid of waking Cui Zhen with her voice, so she quickly waved her hand and led Wei Cheng outside, smiling and saying, "I'm just asking you, did they, father and daughter, come?" Wei Cheng said, "I don't think so. I was so confused that I didn't even know if Fei Changhe came or not." Then someone came to Wei Cheng to talk. Guo Fang said, "You go. If you meet my brother, ask him to come inside. That Hongqi Zhang, it was decided that he would send us here and also send us back to Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Ye family was bustling until dusk. The Taoist ceremony was over, and most of the relatives and friends had left. Ye Second Madam stroked Wei Cheng's shoulders and back, saying, "Wei Cheng, you are tired today. You knelt down and then got up, got up and then knelt down. During the funeral procession, you had to walk four or five li in total. This is not like a happy occasion, where walking a few more steps doesn't matter. You are tired today." Guo Qi saw Ye Second Madam say this, and followed up, saying, "Wei Cheng, you should go to bed early. It's time for my sister and me to get on the boat. I hope you can come to Shanghai in a month. You are in mourning, so my sister and I dare not accompany you to seek excessive entertainment, but accompanying you to relax and relieve boredom is still permissible." Wei Cheng grabbed Guo Qi's hand and said, "Don't go. It doesn't matter if we let Hongqi Zhang wait one more night. I finally waited for you to come, and I haven't said anything yet." Guo Qi, without waiting for him to state other reasons, said, "If you don't want me to go, I won't go." Wei Cheng learned that Cui Zhen had gotten up as usual, and felt even more comforted in his heart. That night, in the midst of all the busyness, Wei Cheng and Guo Qi had the opportunity to chat, and they talked about Guo Fang. (87)</p>
