<h3>夏季的防疫　時疫發生多由飮食不愼强健腸胃自可减少染患</h3>
<p>那厭人的蒼蠅，飛滿了人間，由於它們的來往逐飛，就處處的埋伏了人生的危機。最重要的腸疾病，有：痢疾，腸傷寒等症，偶一不愼，就會被它們把生命剝奪了去的。所以傳染到這種病症的緣故，大多由於飮食的不愼，把這種種，痢疾菌啦，　寒菌啦！帶到腸裏去，才給它們機會，在人身體中繁殖倡狂起來了，它們的症狀，簡單的寫在下面一點！「霍亂」普通稱爲虎列拉，是一種最可怕的流行症，可能在很短時期結束了人的生命！輕的只不過吐瀉幾回，頭覺着疼或暈，身體微倦，四肢較冷，約一週卽可痊愈，而重者則每以致命，嘔吐及排洩劇甚，眼窩下凹，指螺下陷，面蒼白，口喝，聲低啞，痙　等態。但身體衰弱的人，多生此病，假若服了强身補血的「若素」體格强健起來，抵抗病菌强大，絕不能患這種的。</p>
<p>「傷寒」普通約長四週，初週食慾不强，倦怠發燒。次週則熱度加高，約在攝氏三十九度及四十度，意識不淸，譫語，舌苔乾燥，暗黑而厚，而舌尖剝離反是，此週最危險，三週時尙不知注意，如腸內遺瘍，甚至出血，穿孔，而溫度則降低，不免虛脫而死；但度過三週，無此現象，則四週後體溫復常，諸症象消失？卽均漸次痊兪矣。</p>
<p>「赤痢」普通分赤白兩種，但赤痢較重，而通俗亦稱爲痢疾，輕者類似大腸炎，腹部甚痛，排洩時裏急後重，便中帶黏液質，但重者則腸部生潰瘍，便內有濃血，倦怠無力，無神，排洩次數增多，往往死亡。</p>
<p>總觀以上三種疾病，由於一時的不愼，而遭受到很大的痛苦，甚至死亡，敢不戒哉？故古人有言；「病從口入，禍從口出。」誠不謬也，但飮食的謹愼，不能那麼準有把握，現在，有救星了，比打預防針還可靠方便的，就是那最著名的「若素」，它是最可靠，最安全的預防良藥，如果你不願受到疾病的痛苦。就趕快服用這偉大的若素。「若素」成分爲維他命B强力消化酵素賀爾蒙…等故有特効。（各地各藥房均售）</p>

<h3>尼羅河散記（中）</h3>
<p>山阿斯旺乘帆船在尼羅河上行駛，兩岸風物如畫，就民風而言，是文明與野蠻的交流，而氣候的佳麗，如入天堂一般。此去十八日，抵達埃及第二大城盧克索（Luxar），此地人種複雜，世界各國人民都有。在離阿期旺不久，先要經過一小島名白列夫島（Bahrlf　Lsland），島上有居民一千五百人，完全遺世獨立，與外界絕無血統上的相混，就是衣食所需，都是島民親手製造。祖先並非阿拉伯人而爲埃及人，自古代以迄近今，有亞述人，希臘人，羅馬人，阿拉伯人，土耳其人的迭次進犯，大都只能達到下埃及的幾個較大城市中，沒有注意此島上的居民。島上靑年男女擇配，都就一千五百人中選擇嫁娶。</p>
<p>島上的全體居民，其實等於一個家庭，在上埃及有不少小村落都是這樣。婚姻都就同種人中間擇娶。有一村莊，居民在四千人以上，但僅有三個家庭。埃及有數朝代甚至流行着異父母兄妹結合。現在的婚姻關係仍是在近親之中打圈子，不過異父母兄妹的婚配不大遇到了。埃及人到今日仍是强健精壯，大槪道種近親婚配對於他們並無損害。五千年來埃及人思想動作的習慣，性格的陶冶，變異極少，這和近親結婚多少有點關點。最主要的變化則爲居民已奉回敎爲宗敎，但在愚夫愚婦中間，還流行着寄鬥遁甲的邪敎，荒誕不經的迷信，這種邪說愚行，巳經深入人心，流傳至今，有數千年了。</p>
<p>白列夫島上的一切完全保持着古代風味，和埃及古墓上的壁畫有點雷同，相異者少而類似者多。</p>
<p>自白列夫島北行，又抵達一個村莊名阿奎白（El　Agaba），位處尼羅河有岸，附近有鐵道經過。村上設有電力引擎，自尼羅河中取水，灌溉農田。就設備而言，尙稱現代化，但是古風仍舊保存：每當村中有重要人物故世，街上就只見號泣於昊大的女人，雙手舉了起來，搶地呼天，盡自己所有的力量，哭着喊着。這樣大聲啼哭，往往有數日的暗　，　細語的聲音都不能發出。而目不單哭泣就算，還要蓬散了頭髮，撕毀衣服，身上塗滿汚泥、據說，這種儀式，在五千年前的舊王國中，凡遇喪事，都要這樣的「誌痛。」</p>
<p>自電力廠到村中不過數十步路，但兩者的距離至少要隔三千年。村中的房屋由河泥壅成，河泥是尼羅河流域間自古以來造成房屋的主要村料。有的比較講究些，則用河泥製造的磚塊砌屋·製造泥磚的方法極其簡單，先把河泥攪和，然後傾入一個木頭的模　中間，把溢出在上面的餘泥削平，即可把濕的泥磚拍出，放在陽光下曬乾即成。村中所見情景，恍如翻開一頁古代埃及的書史：一個陶土工人正在利用手工製造一隻水壺；一個老人坐在棕櫚樹旁邊，把棕櫚的纖維抽下來，搓紋成繩索；婦女在編織和第三朝代相仿的籃子，或在第十二朝代的織機上紡紗織布。有一理髮匠爲一孩子剃頭，留着一簇頭髮不剃光，據說這是宗敎習慣。木匠鋸板，不是平放着鋸，而是垂直了鋸下去的，恰與古代壁畫上的一樣。農夫所用的耒耜犂耙，全和古帝王墳慕上所畫的一樣。</p>
<p>此地只有一種民族的典型，就是在熱閙的城市中，無論土者的血液中巳雜有阿拉伯人，土耳其人或希臘人的血液，結果並非成爲一種複合的人種，而仍舊是一個埃及種族。沙漠，日光，與尼羅河似乎是統治這塊土地的三個主宰，使生長於這片泥土上的人們，都有同一型的性格與習慣。尼羅河濱，上埃及第二大城盧克素風景，河岸遠處為法老王時代所建之廟宇。</p>

<h3>淸歌消夏記（一）</h3>
<p>— 蘇少卿</p>
<p>寡人有疾，寡人好戲，七八月之間旱，酷暑蒸人，燕居且揮汗如雨，更不願到戲院觀劇，然友朋酬酢之間，每遇劇人在座，載言載笑，有時放聲高歌，頓忘暑熱，亦足樂也，今一一記之，以留鴻爪。</p>
<p>紀玉良</p>
<p>七月初旬，江宅有絲竹淸歌之會，如期而至者二十餘人，屈指以數，唱老生者，居大半數，吾未到之前，紀玉良巳唱數段，吾旣遲到未聽，乃特煩玉良唱斬子「忽聽得老娘親」一段，彼嗷然允諾，於胡琴西皮倒板中，乃唱「怒惱楊　昭」一段搖板，嗓音饗亮震耳，於「笑壞了衆英豪」之笑字使一嘎調，高寬圓勁，聲動標塵，與宋寶羅之嘎調，可稱二怪，譚富英嗓音寬亮，衆人公認爲佳喉，獨於嘎調，費盡智力而卒不够高，今紀宋二人，同時在滬，唱固未至佳境，然每遇嘎調，若不費吹灰之力，且肥美異常，眞二怪也。玉良唱畢，吾唱堅持非唱下面倒板不可，玉良不從，謂無可聽，主人江君，老於顧曲，在旁有解，謂斬子倒板，太覺費力，今以倒板換一倒板，改唱「大砲一響驚天地」可也。意謂戰太平中之西皮倒板也，玉良諾之，但因此惹出發笑之事？滿座賓客，爲之笑口大開。蓋因玉良之私用琴師某，以爲是唱戰太平之二簧倒板，「頭戴着紫金　」一　段，遂拉出二簧倒板過門，適巧紀玉良　心不在焉，隨着琴音將大砲一響照簧倒板唱出，「一響唱完，下面應接唱「驚天地」，玉良始感覺唱二簧腔不　唱出，乃中止不唱，轉面言曰，「這是怎麽啦」，此時玉良險上有少許羞澀之態，又云，「錯了，重唱，唱頭戴着紫令盜」，衆賓纔發現方才唱錯，不由得一齊哈哈　笑。王良面巳向牆壁，預備再唱，我覺得他有窘狀，唱畢「有勞夫人點雄兵，衆賓乃報以彩聽。</p>
<p>陳大濩</p>
<p>陳君杭州著名票友，唱學譚派，六七年尙曾怱怱一見，未聆其唱，聞彼被漢口邀去唱戲，有湖南靑衣票友朱嘯秋同事，此最近事，今屢　將搭黃金出演，雖尙未成事實，想不還矣。由找特煩其一歌，陳唱洪羊洞快三眼「自那日朝罷歸」一段，嗓音　佳，官唱譚派，調問在軟工調之間，高音　亮之至，唱法巳在水準以上，精微之處，覺尙有未至，此因年齡關係，陳君今纔二十歲左有，五官淸秀，身材似趙培鑫，未見其台上唱過，不知若何，倘做工可覩，則下海可紅也。</p>
<h3>雨後春筍之淸唱歌塲</h3>
<p>— 病鳩</p>
<p>歌女淸唱，由來已久，遜淸末葉，「會芳」「小廣寒等以新穎之姿態，乘時崛起，命名日書塲，歌女多書寓中人，美其名曰校書，若輩借唱戲作幌子，以招徠其淫業，聽客可任意點戲，且有女侍奉烟茶，頗極視聽之樂。迨辛民國，「天仙一「羣仙」等髦兒戲班興，此種書塲，逐漸衰落，直至民十左有，游藝塲蠭起，塲內多設歌女淸唱班，更名曰羣芳會唱，當時以大世界之共和廳爲個中有擘。羣芳陣容，最爲整齊，時人遊大世界者，多集中於共和廳，其盛况概可想見。近年來，此風復熾，戰前小廣寒」「時代「長樂」三家，先後起班鈎心鬬角，競爭劇烈，後究以營業淸淡而相繼停業。迄今碩果僅存者，僅「小廣寒」一家而巳。泊中最近「時代」主事者，首創歌女伴坐之新玩意，刺激聽客心理，收效極宏，以是營業大盛，紅極一時，旁人見之眼紅，相繼開設。「高樂」創才於前，爵樂繼之於後，此外如「大羅天」設備雖較簡陋，歌女陣容則極爲堅强，「張園」新闢露天歌塲，別開生面，生意亦不弱，昨日開慕之「天宮」，規模不小，設備亦相當考究，實係「爵樂」勁敵。聞「天宮」除京劇歌唱外，尙有平津大鼓等節目，又一新鮮花樣也。至於正在籌備而尙未開設者，計有「長樂」「仝羽春」「人新」上海舞廳舊址等處，惟目下百物昂貴，內部裝修，費用浩大，且歌女人才有限，粥少僧多，恐亦不敷分配。或曰，上海人最富仿效心，見他人可爲，吾亦繼之，前途有無把握不問也。盲人瞎馬，其不失敗也幾希。此與前一時期之錢莊烟行，最近夕保險公司股票公司，情形正復相同，恐最近將來必無法維持，紛紛停歇，成爲時代之陳蹟而巳。</p>
<h3>黃金聆曲記</h3>
<p>— 寄涯</p>
<p>筆者自幼即好平劇，與羅君鐵臣求學北平時，暇輒往聽戲以自娛，而羅君猶復悉心揣摹，不遺餘力，雖迄今不輟，筆者終以本錢不足，又復爲俗務所牽，雖嗜痂有癖，祗好聽人引吭高歌，而自己就噤若寒蟬了，所以筆者嘗謂唱戲雖小道，非具有天才者，不足以語此。第一要有本錢，第二要口齒淸，第三要身段伶，第四要能體會入微，四者畢具，然後方可海刃有餘，譬如善於腎法者，運筆自如，無論顏柳歐蘇，一學便得其神似，至於不善書法的人，即使費盡九牛二虎之力，終不過塗鴉而月，休想率得神似，所以筆者敢肯定的說一句，玩耍不是一件容易的事。海上票房林立，有些票房具有悠久的歷史，但是能够粉墨登塲，足以引起觀衆玩味的，實在好像鳳毛麟角，不易多得。像此番上海時疫醫院同仁輔元分堂演唱義務戲所邀請的幾位趙君培鑫，張君哲生，汪君其俊，孫君鈞鄉等，可以稱得海上票友當中數一數二的人才了。哲生，其俊，筆者從前還欣賞過數次，至於趙君培鑫，所謂閔名巳久，從未聆到過一次，前幾天筆者到申報館去，編者囑寫此番黃金義務戲以實申報遊藝攔，我以此調不彈巳久，初未敢效勞，重以諸老友極力慫恿，於是盛情難却，雖然溽暑蒸人，亦可於此得聆趙君培鑫的劇藝，亦屬耳福不淺，遂亦權爲一試。</p>
<p>第一日筆者驅車而往，因時略晚，該院上下巳無虛席，幸由孫君蘭亭殷勤招待，方不虛此行，其時戲碼張哲生與汪其俊兩君之打嚴嵩已成尾聲，雖未能窺其全豹，而於一鱗半爪之間，亦可概見其工夫之老練矣。打嚴嵩終塲後，休息片時，即接演四郎探母，在一個急急風之後，一時電炬齊放彩聲雷動中，驟見聞名已久之名票趙君培鑫飾四郎徐步出塲，扮相之雍容華責，臺步之徐疾合拍，直與內行不爽毫釐，期非研究有素者，決難臻此。引子「金井鎖格桐，長嘆空隨一陣風」兩句，字字淸澈，韻味雋永，博得　堂彩聲，筆者亦不禁爲之叫好，並非如捧塲者之隨聲附和，確有入於耳而悅於心，不期然而然也。人謂確有馬連良之風味，然筆者聽戲，向不辯其派別如何，祗要覺得韻味雋永，使得聽衆賞心樂意，藝術已經高妙，何必論其派別。以趙君咬字之準確淸脆，本錢之運用自如，儘可自成一派，不必以限於馬而止也。唸白至「思想起來，好不傷感人也」句，一種抑鬱悽慘淚隨聲下之情况，曲爲道出，合座爲之讚賞不絕，西皮慢板「楊延輝坐宮院自思自嘆……」一段，唱來無懈可擊，轉二六到「我的娘領人馬來得北番」句，又博得滿堂彩聲，幾段快板，急若運珠，字字淸澈，確爲難得。次由孫君鈞卿接唱出關見娘，筆者以天氣太熱，未能畢聆終曲而走。次日爲趙君培鑫與名女伶金素琴之寶運燈，筆者爲培鑫之藝力所吸引，兼之金素琴輟演巳久，藝術當更有進境，遂於飯後叉驅車而往，至則適演挑華車，由該院名伶高雪樵去高冲，　把工夫，確屬不錯，繼即演實蓮燈，此戲爲唱做並重之生旦戲，趙君之搖板「聽說是二嬌兒打死人，冷水澆頭懷抱冰」句，輕淸有勁，快三眼「昔日裏有個孤竹君」，使腔新頴，別饒韻味，博得彩聲不少。金素琴的二簧慢板「英不是二奴才不聽敎訓」一段，淸脆委婉，悅耳動聽，至二人之做工細膩不煩，堪稱珠聯璧合，名伶以此爲職業，能够藝術獨到，巳屬難能可貴，至如趙君以票友而具此工夫，誠可謂嘆觀止矣。孫君鈞卿打薣罵曹中之播鼓，疾若萬馬奔騰，輕若微風動竹，抑且擊法變化無窮，非深得此中三昧者，亦鮮能臻此。第三日趙君培鑫之烏盆計，筆者深欲細聆其反二簧，但以如此天氣，悶熱逼人，祗好割愛，此次承孫君蘭亭竭誠招待，盛情彌足感也。</p>
<h3>三句勿離本行</h3>
<p>— 起碼說書</p>
<p>戰前書塲最熱鬧的地方，只有南市邑廟花園內，不過各有各的銷路，第一塲子不能做差，譬如柴行廳必請最規矩的評話家，除非巳故名家郭少梅先嚴曹安山等最爲合宜，就因該地獨多不求花苗，務須經濟實惠的老聽客，自然非此等書不足滿其望。不佞初到上海時，早想佔此一席地，可惜運動失敗。</p>
<p>至滬戰揭幕，南市書塲相繼停業，柴行廳當然不能例外，直到今朝，仍未恢復，唉慚生。</p>
<p>從前得意樓茶館內，也附設書塲，分樓上樓下二處，彼處的聽客大多有閒階級，或者摩登化人物，時常有對對情侶，携手出入，她們都愛聽香艷歌曲，風月趣聞，所以最合口味的，只有說唱俱全的彈詞家，像半伯康徐雲志等，都是該塲的紅角兒，也能和柴行廳一樣天天客滿。說也奇怪，得意樓與柴行廳相去只有數步，獨有二地的聽客，恰巧成一個反比例，假使有時掉差了陣綫，那是小必說，一定二個五台山，眞叫謬以毫釐，失之千里了</p>
<p>更正　逕啟者：閱五日游藝界「記名票趙培鑫君」文內述及敝社會長邵長齡君獨捐二萬五千元一節，查與事實不符，該款係由邵君向親友勸募，並非個人所捐，深恐外界不明眞相，請在貴欄更正，不勝惑盼，此致游藝界編輯室，樂成平劇社啟。</p>
<h3>郎德山再度登臺</h3>
<p>技術家郎德山，前在大光明登臺，備受觀衆熱烈擁護，日夜數塲，無不客滿，祗以演期有限，向隅者大有其人。頃悉郎君爲酬答友好盛情起見，將定於本星期日起再度在南京大戲院，與新萬花團一同登臺，表演共生平絕技右圖爲郎君最近之小影。</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（七）　迅雷</p>
<p>第二天上午，還是隱着雪花，中午雪停了，葉二太太道：「雪倒不能不說是瑞雪，下得早一些，倘然能下在大臘天，那就更好。」有三四隻麻雀，在屋面上跳來跳去，一跳一面在雪層裏找尋食糧。站在世德堂裏，對外邊一望，可以望得見曠塲外邊的樹巓，樹葉當然是沒有了，　　的樹枝上，堆着白線條似的雲，一陣風吹着，那雪便成塊的掉下來。那隻黃狗，拖了一條尾巴，從大門外輕悠悠的走進來，牠只是走直線，一路印着牠的梅花脚跡。翠珍看雪是停了，喚阿興拿鐵鎌，拿畚箕，幫了喜鵲掃雪。維城痴痴的站在雙梅書屋裏，說：「不要掃，不要掃掃，留一天看，明天等雪溶解了一部份再掃。」翠珍不明白他是什麽意思，以爲維城又生了獸念，葉二太太道：「是讀書人，都歡喜雪，他老爹，他爸爸，他叔叔，都有這麼一個念頭。」</p>
<p>不想到了傍晚，風靜止了。倒又白迷迷的下雪起。葉二太太偷偷的去看維城做些什麼，一看時，不在雙梅書屋，又從屋子裏邊走，繞到他寢室裏，也不在寢室。這有些奇怪，喚了一聲，又走到雙梅書屋來，又喚了一聲，這可發覺維城在雙梅書屋裏邊一間屋子裏。葉二太太道：「你在做什麽？」維城道：「我不做麼。」葉二太太到裏邊一看，桌子上攤了書，也有信牋，大槪是在寫。葉二太太道：「是不是寫信？」維城道：「是的。」葉二太太道：「你可不能把遺囑上話吿訴人的。」維城道「嬸娘，這個我知道。現在，只有我，嬸娘，翠珍姊，三個人知道。」（一四九）</p>

<h3>Gandhi Issues Statement: Plans Final Appeal to Viceroy, But Not an Ultimatum; White House Does Not Intend to Intervene in Indian Situation</h3>
<p>Havas, Bombay, 6th: Mahatma Gandhi of India stated to the press today that the National Congress Party plans to make a final appeal to Lord Linlithgow, the British Viceroy of India, but it is not in the nature of an ultimatum. In fact, it is merely that "I will write to Viceroy Linlithgow, and I will do everything I can to avoid an open conflict. If our suggestions are adopted, negotiations can begin," he said. It is also learned that Gandhi is scheduled to deliver a speech to the Executive Committee of the National Congress Party tomorrow. The content of the speech is unknown, but it is known that he will defend his proposal currently submitted to the Executive Committee, which advocates that a liberated India should first negotiate with Japan.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency Telegram from Bangkok, 7th: According to news from Bombay, Gandhi met with British and American journalists in Bombay and answered various questions, stating briefly that negotiations with Japan would be difficult to achieve. India must first achieve independence. It would be dangerous if the Allied powers insisted on delaying India's independence until after the war. A reporter asked if Britain allowed India to be independent, would he set a deadline for negotiations? Gandhi replied that he had not considered limiting the duration of negotiations.</p>
<p>Allied News Agency Telegram from Lisbon, 7th: According to news received here, the Executive Committee of the Indian National Congress Party has passed a new resolution to respond to the Governor-General's Office of India's publication of Gandhi's proposal. How the new resolution will deal with the case of negotiations with Japan, which Gandhi implied in his original proposal, is of great concern to the British and American sides. According to a telegram from New Delhi, an American journalist asked Gandhi, "Can you guarantee that you will not negotiate with Japan in the future?" Gandhi firmly replied, "My negotiations with Japan are for the consideration of our interests, so I cannot guarantee that I will not negotiate with Japan."</p>
<p>Allied News Agency Telegram from Lisbon, 7th: According to news from Washington, a White House spokesman yesterday refused to comment on reports that President Roosevelt might appeal to Gandhi to reconsider his threat to launch a civil disobedience movement.

<p>Congress Party Meeting Begins Yesterday</p>
<p>Allied News Agency Telegram from Lisbon, 7th: According to news from Bombay, the All-India Congress Party began its meeting this afternoon to approve the "Quit India" resolution. Indian leader Gandhi addressed the crowd for forty-five minutes during the meeting. Approximately 250 Congress Party members attended. During Gandhi's address, he did not criticize the resolution of the Standing Committee but expressed that after the committee approved the resolution, he would deliver another speech. Gandhi appeared quite thin but very confident. He began his address at 4:00 PM (Indian time). Before Gandhi took his seat, he stood for a moment, responding to the cheers of the crowd with a smile. The band played the Indian national anthem. The audience seats for the meeting were reserved two days in advance, resulting in thousands of people being unable to enter the venue. Therefore, loudspeakers were installed at the venue so that the crowd outside could hear the proceedings of the meeting.</p>
<p>Allied News Agency Telegram from Lisbon, 6th: The All-India Congress Party Congress, which will open in Bombay on the 7th, will hold a historic discussion on the resolution demanding the withdrawal of British forces from India. The proposal, drafted based on the fundamental aim of achieving Indian independence in Gandhi's original proposal, was put forward by Nehru and seconded by Speaker Acharya. It is widely expected that the All-India Congress will support and pass the proposal when it convenes. On the first day of the meeting, Nehru will first present the resolution. However, given the serious nature of the proposal, the discussion is expected to extend to the 8th or 10th. In the meantime, the British side will inevitably carry out final maneuvers inside and outside the Congress in an attempt to create an opposing atmosphere. At the same time, the Governor-General's Office of India may also take various high-pressure measures. Regarding this matter, according to news from Bombay, the Indian Governor-General's Office has mobilized the police force to prepare for any eventuality.</p>
<p>Acharya Asks for Support of Claims</p>
<p>Allied News Agency Telegram from Lisbon, 6th: According to a telegram from Bombay, in view of the fact that the Governor-General's Office of India deliberately distorted the publication of Gandhi's original proposal, causing misunderstanding among people around the world, in order to thoroughly understand the true meaning of the Indian independence movement, Acharya, the speaker of the Indian National Congress Party, decided to send letters to Chongqing, Roosevelt, and other Allied heads of state, requesting support for the claims of the National Congress Party.</p>
<p>Allied News Agency Telegram from Lisbon, 7th: All India Radio broadcast that Acharya, the Chairman of the All-India National Congress Party, announced this morning that British and American troops must leave India immediately.

<p>British Prime Minister's Trip to Soviet Union of Great Importance</p>
<p>Havas News Agency Telegram from Helsinki, 6th: Political figures here already consider British Prime Minister Churchill's trip to Moscow to be certain. Most newspapers believe that Churchill's trip is of great importance, as it is rumored that the Soviet Union threatened to make a separate peace with Germany if a second front was not opened in the near future. A Berlin correspondent for the "Hufvudstadsbladet" newspaper telegraphed that the Soviet Union had notified Britain to prepare for a separate peace with Germany. Upon receiving this notice, Churchill hurriedly set off for Moscow in an attempt to prevent the Soviet Union from taking this step. Churchill also intends to obtain assurances from the Soviet Union that it will defend the Caucasus at all costs, as the loss of this important area would jeopardize nearby British territories. On the Soviet side, it is believed that the Caucasus is not an important area and that defending the Caucasus can only be done when Britain launches a war in Western Europe. Therefore, the main force of the Red Army is now concentrating on the areas that it considers important, namely Stalingrad and the Volga River. At the same time, Finnish newspapers attach great importance to the Caucasus offensive, believing that it can compensate for the failure of the Leningrad offensive. Finnish forces are tying down a large number of enemy troops on the front lines, providing great assistance to the German army. The pro-German organization "Uussuomi" newspaper reported that Germany believes that the war has not yet reached its end stage and that Germany and its enemies will have to fight for a considerable amount of time. This situation will affect every country in Europe, so this winter, we must still prepare to make military and material efforts.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency Telegram from Berlin, 7th: The German Foreign Ministry spokesman did not comment on the rumors of a meeting between Churchill and Stalin yesterday.</p>
<p>Public Opinion Demands Unified Command</p>
<p>Havas News Agency Telegram from Zurich, 6th: The Neue Zürcher Zeitung published a telegram from its London correspondent today, stating that public opinion in Britain and the United States is unanimously demanding a unified command, or at least its implementation in Europe as soon as possible. The Soviet Union also advocates the establishment of a unified command. Soviet military expert General Shurovsky, who visited London with Foreign Minister Molotov in May of this year, published an article in the Times of London yesterday, analyzing the strategy of the last World War, and said that the Allies were able to achieve final victory in 1918 because the Allies worked hard, adjusted well, and had a way to achieve it. The current war situation is very similar to that of 1918. German troops are taking the offensive everywhere, but this offensive is only intended to conceal the truth in their country. Therefore, the Soviet Union and its allies will achieve victory earlier than generally expected. British military and political figures believe that this article is of great significance. The Soviet Embassy in England attaches even greater importance to this and has printed the article into a booklet and distributed it to important figures in Britain and foreign countries.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency Telegram from London, 6th: 105,686 workers from various industries in the London area recently elected 171 representatives and submitted a petition to Prime Minister Churchill, demanding the immediate opening of a second front, stating briefly, "We can no longer sit idly by and watch the Soviet Union sacrifice alone. It must be understood that our glory and status are in danger. If we do not immediately open a first front, it will be too late. Therefore, we advocate immediate action."</p>
<h3>German Air Force Attacks Britain, Uses Incendiary Bombs; Cambridge and Edinburgh Bombed; British Aircraft Also Attack German Industrial Areas</h3>

<h3>Summer Epidemic Prevention: Outbreaks of Seasonal Diseases Mostly Due to Careless Diet; Strengthening the Stomach and Intestines Can Reduce Infection</h3>
<p>Those annoying flies are everywhere, filling the human world. Because of their coming and going, they are ambushing the crises of human life everywhere. The most important intestinal diseases are dysentery and typhoid fever. A moment of carelessness can lead to them depriving one of life. The reason for being infected with these diseases is mostly due to careless diet, bringing all sorts of dysentery germs and typhoid germs into the intestines, giving them the opportunity to breed and rage in the human body. Their symptoms are briefly written below! "Cholera," commonly known as tiger cholera, is the most terrible epidemic, which can end a person's life in a very short period! Mild cases are nothing more than vomiting and diarrhea a few times, a headache or dizziness, slight fatigue, and cold limbs, and can be cured in about a week, while severe cases are often fatal, with severe vomiting and excretion, sunken eye sockets, sunken finger screws, pale face, thirst, hoarse voice, and spasms. However, people with weak bodies are more likely to get this disease. If they take the body-strengthening and blood-nourishing "Roxu", their physique will become strong and their resistance to germs will be strong, and they will never suffer from this disease.</p>
<p>"Typhoid fever" usually lasts about four weeks. In the first week, appetite is poor, and one feels tired and has a fever. In the second week, the fever increases, about 39 to 40 degrees Celsius, consciousness is unclear, there is delirium, the tongue coating is dry, dark, and thick, while the tip of the tongue is peeled off. This week is the most dangerous. If one does not pay attention in the third week, such as intestinal ulcers, there may even be bleeding, perforation, and the temperature will drop, inevitably leading to exhaustion and death; but if one passes the third week without this phenomenon, then the body temperature will return to normal after the fourth week, and all symptoms will disappear, gradually recovering.</p>
<p>"Dysentery" is generally divided into red and white types, but red dysentery is more severe, and is also commonly known as dysentery. Mild cases are similar to colitis, with severe abdominal pain, urgency and tenesmus during excretion, and mucus in the stool, but severe cases have ulcers in the intestines, blood in the stool, fatigue, lack of energy, and increased frequency of excretion, often leading to death.</p>
<p>In summary, these three diseases cause great suffering and even death due to temporary carelessness. How can one not be careful? Therefore, the ancients said: "Disease enters through the mouth, and misfortune comes from the mouth." This is indeed true. However, dietary caution cannot be guaranteed to be so accurate. Now, there is a savior, more reliable and convenient than getting vaccinations, which is the most famous "Roxu". It is the most reliable and safest preventive medicine. If you do not want to suffer from disease, quickly take this great Roxu. "Roxu" contains ingredients such as vitamin B, powerful digestive enzymes, hormones, etc., so it has special effects. (Available at pharmacies everywhere)</p>

<h3>Large-Scale Tank Battle Unfolds Southwest of Stalingrad: German Military Announces Capture of Three Cities; Soviet Reserves Deployed from the Don River Bend</h3>
<p>Moscow, July 7th, Reuters—According to the midnight communiqué from the Soviet Information Bureau, Soviet forces led by General Timoshenko are compelled to continue retreating south of the lower Don River. Stalingrad is now facing a new threat from German forces in the area south of Kotelnikovo (50 miles east of Tsimlyansk, on the south bank of the Don River). The communiqué stated: "On August 6th, Soviet forces engaged in intense fighting in the areas of Kletskaya, south of Kotelnikovo, south of Belaya Glina, and south of Koshevskaya. No significant changes occurred in other sectors of the front." It further added, "Heavy fighting continues in and south of the Kletskaya area."</p>
<p>Lisbon, July 7th, Central News Agency—German forces continue to advance to a railway line 160 kilometers southwest of Stalingrad, breaking through the Soviet defense line in one go. The Soviet forces are putting up strong resistance and are currently engaged in a large-scale tank battle centered on this railway line. German forces are using tank armies and mechanized units to push forward in the front lines, suppressing the Soviet forces. In the tug-of-war in the Don River bend, although the German forces have the upper hand, Soviet forces are repeatedly launching counterattacks in various locations. The war in this area has reached a decisive stage.</p>
<p>Berlin, July 7th, Huitong News Agency—According to the German High Command, street fighting occurred before Soviet forces withdrew from Tikhoretsk in the Caucasus region. This city is a railway hub. Soviet forces used armored vehicles to assist in counterattacks but were repelled. German and allied forces continue to advance south. Enemy forces north of Voroshilovgrad attempted to break through to the east but were repelled by German forces. Remnants of Soviet forces north of Armavir were either annihilated or captured. German aircraft destroyed many vehicles and horse-drawn carts. A fuel depot was bombed and caught fire. The retreating Soviet forces were also bombed, and transportation lines in the Soviet rear were heavily bombed, including the Kagalnaya station west of Armavir and the port of Tuapse on the Black Sea coast. This port is a hub for roads, railways, and pipelines. Romanian troops are fighting alongside German forces between the Don River and the Caucasus, pursuing the Soviet forces and capturing many prisoners. German aircraft shot down 39 enemy aircraft in the southern part of the Eastern Front, and anti-aircraft units also shot down several enemy aircraft.</p>
<p>Xiongcheng, July 7th, Reuters—Reports from Moscow indicate that the southern German forces attacking the important industrial city of Stalingrad on the Volga River have broken through Kotelnikovo (100 miles southeast of Stalingrad) and cut off the railway from Stalingrad to Krasnodar in that area. This development makes the situation facing Stalingrad even more dangerous, as a second threat from the Don River bend is progressing. Meanwhile, the German forces south of the Don River continue to advance deep into the Caucasus. Reports from London believe that the threat to the Soviet oil fields in the Caucasus has increased in the past 24 hours, and General Timoshenko has deployed some of the Soviet reserves from the Don River to resist the German advance.</p>
<p>Berlin, July 7th, Reuters—The German High Command announced today that German forces, starting from a bridgehead established on the Kuban River, continue to advance deep into the Caucasus and have now reached within 30 miles north of the important oil-producing center of Maikop. According to war reports, German forces have also captured Timoshevskaya (the capital of the Kuban region), a crossroads on the Rostov-Krasnodar railway, as well as Yeysk and Armavir.</p>
<p>Stockholm, July 7th, Havas—The Soviet government newspaper "Pravda" recently reported that German forces near Kletskaya on the Kuban front have received reinforcements, including several infantry divisions and many tanks. According to German prisoners of war, the German forces in this area have suffered heavy losses, with the 35th German Division having lost most of its strength. Fierce air battles between German and Soviet forces are taking place over the Don River.</p>
<p>Soviet General to Use Mountains to Stop German Advance</p>
<p>Stockholm, July 7th, Havas—According to reports from the Eastern Front, large-scale infantry and tank battles have taken place in the steppes between Kotelnikovo and the Volga River in the past two days. Despite fierce resistance from the Red Army, they were eventually forced to abandon their positions. Neutral military observers believe that after occupying Tsimlyanskaya, German forces have now penetrated deep into an area between the Don and Sal Rivers and are approaching the Volga River, threatening Stalingrad from the south. The Red Army has reportedly committed almost all of its motorized units to try to stop the German forces from reaching the Volga River. Soviet military circles acknowledge that the Red Army on the Stalingrad front is in a difficult situation. The city is not only threatened from the west and northwest but is also under threat from the south. The Red Army has been unable to stop the German advance. The fighting in the Kletskaya area northwest of Stalingrad is becoming increasingly fierce. The Red Army claims to be holding its ground and even launching local counterattacks, but the German offensive is increasing with each passing day. The German forces are also using paratroopers to land in the Soviet rear, disrupting important transportation lines. This "airborne infantry" has landed on the east bank of the Don River to cut off the transportation lines between the Don River bend and Stalingrad. The German forces have air superiority, a fact that Moscow news reports also acknowledge without reservation. The Soviets claim that groups of 25 to 30 German aircraft are constantly flying over the front lines and the Red Army's rear, monitoring Soviet air bases, thereby greatly hindering the activities of the Soviet Air Force. According to reports from the Caucasus front, German forces have cut off the Maikop-Baku railway at Nevinnomyssk. The fall of Armavir is only a matter of time, and Krasnodar to the north is also under threat. However, it is becoming increasingly difficult for German forces to approach the Caucasus oil region. So far, the area through which the German forces have passed is a steppe, and motorized units can move freely. Beyond this lies the Caucasus Mountains, with deep valleys, dense forests, and steep cliffs, which will block the advance of tanks. Given this terrain, the Soviet forces can take advantage of natural obstacles to wait for the enemy in a relaxed manner, and the German advance will inevitably be delayed. The only area where German tanks can still move freely is the triangular area from Prokhladny to Kropotkin to the Kuban River.</p>
<p>Bern, July 6th, Havas—In the past 24 hours, the pressure exerted by German forces in the Kuban region of the Caucasus and the Stalingrad region has increased without diminishing. The position of the Red Army is deteriorating and becoming increasingly critical. For example, the Red Army in the Kuban region has lost the ability to prevent German forces from occupying the oil center of Maikop. However, once the Red Army retreats to the Caucasus Mountains, its resistance will inevitably increase. The Red Army's high command, in view of the Red Army's fierce fighting for several weeks, hasty retreats, disordered ranks, and greatly weakened combat effectiveness, deems it necessary to reorganize many units. The left wing of General Timoshenko's forces is currently resolutely resisting, preventing the German forces from advancing towards Krasnodar, but this situation is not enough to cause anxiety among German military circles, as they are deeply convinced that the increased resistance of the Red Army is due to the critical situation of the Red Army on the Taman Peninsula, forcing them to fight like a cornered beast. Since the German forces crossed the Yeya River, they have been continuing to advance in the area around the Sea of Azov. And because the German forces have already occupied the Kerch Peninsula, there is no need to land on the Taman Peninsula. According to military experts, the Red Army will set up new defenses between Pyatigorsk and the Kuma River. The purpose of this is to prevent German forces from attacking Grozny and its oil fields. The German-Romanian forces continue to advance between the Don and Sal Rivers and have reached an important position that threatens the right flank of the Red Army's defenses between the Volga and Don Rivers. According to a dispatch from an Italian war correspondent, the nature of the fighting on this line has now changed. The Red Army is now fighting a desperate battle, but the German high command is always able to deploy troops to win, leaving Red Army generals unable to cope. For example, the Italian newspaper reported: "The German forces are preparing to attack, never taking geographical factors into consideration. The Soviet side has never been able to anticipate the enemy's direction and actions, or obtain information in advance. Therefore, every counterattack by the Red Army is too late and consistently fails to stop the German advance."</p>

Not far from Aswan, you must first pass a small island called Bahrlf Island. The island has 1,500 residents who are completely isolated from the world and have no blood ties with the outside world. Even the necessities of food and clothing are made by the islanders themselves. Their ancestors were not Arabs but Egyptians. From ancient times to the present, the Assyrians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, and Turks have repeatedly invaded, but most of them could only reach a few larger cities in Lower Egypt and did not pay attention to the residents of this island. Young men and women on the island choose their spouses from among the 1,500 people.</p>
<p>All the residents of the island are actually like one family. There are many small villages like this in Upper Egypt. Marriages are chosen from among people of the same ethnicity. There was a village with more than 4,000 residents, but only three families. In several dynasties in Egypt, it was even popular for half-siblings to marry. The current marriage relationships are still circling among close relatives, but marriages between half-siblings are not often encountered. Egyptians are still strong and robust today, and it seems that close-kin marriages have not harmed them. For 5,000 years, the habits of thought and action, and the shaping of character, of the Egyptians have changed very little, and this is somewhat related to close-kin marriages. The most important change is that the residents have converted to Islam, but among the foolish men and women, the heretical religions of divination and armor are still popular, and absurd and unfounded superstitions. These heretical doctrines and foolish acts have penetrated deep into people's hearts and have been passed down for thousands of years.</p>
<p>Everything on Bahrlf Island completely retains the ancient flavor and is somewhat similar to the murals in ancient Egyptian tombs. There are few differences and many similarities.</p>
<p>Traveling north from Bahrlf Island, you reach another village called El Agaba, located on the bank of the Nile River, with a railway passing nearby. The village is equipped with an electric engine that draws water from the Nile River to irrigate the farmland. In terms of equipment, it is considered modern, but the ancient customs are still preserved: whenever an important person in the village dies, only women weeping loudly can be seen on the streets, raising their hands, crying out to the heavens and the earth, and crying and shouting with all their strength. Such loud weeping often lasts for several days, and even whispers cannot be heard. And it is not just weeping, but also disheveling the hair, tearing clothes, and covering the body with mud. It is said that this ritual was required for funerals in the Old Kingdom 5,000 years ago to "express grief."</p>
<p>It is only a few dozen steps from the power plant to the village, but the distance between the two is at least 3,000 years. The houses in the village are made of river mud, which has been the main material for building houses in the Nile River basin since ancient times. Some are more elaborate and use bricks made of river mud to build houses. The method of making mud bricks is extremely simple. First, the river mud is mixed, then poured into a wooden mold, the excess mud on top is leveled off, and the wet mud bricks are patted out and placed in the sun to dry. The scene in the village is like turning the pages of an ancient Egyptian book: a pottery worker is making a kettle by hand; an old man sits next to a palm tree, pulling down the fibers of the palm tree and twisting them into ropes; women are weaving baskets similar to those of the Third Dynasty or spinning yarn and weaving cloth on looms from the Twelfth Dynasty. A barber is shaving a child's head, leaving a tuft of hair unshaved, which is said to be a religious custom. Carpenters saw boards not by laying them flat but by sawing them vertically, just like in ancient murals. The plows and harrows used by farmers are exactly the same as those depicted on the tombs of ancient emperors.</p>
<p>There is only one ethnic type here, and that is that in the bustling cities, even if the blood of the locals has been mixed with Arab, Turkish, or Greek blood, the result is not a composite race, but still an Egyptian race. The desert, the sun, and the Nile River seem to be the three masters who rule this land, giving the people who grow on this soil the same type of character and habits. The scenery of Luxor, the second largest city in Upper Egypt, on the banks of the Nile, with temples built in the time of the Pharaohs in the distance.</p>

<h3>Brief Relief from Oppressive Heat After Rain Shower Yesterday; Autumn Begins Today, Cooler Weather Expected; Strict Inspection of Quarantine Certificates, Intensified Vaccination Efforts</h3>
<p>After being hit by a heat wave, this city has not experienced any abatement in the scorching heat. Yesterday, after 9:00 a.m., the temperature rose in a straight line, reaching 101.7 degrees by noon. Therefore, it was predicted at the time that the afternoon temperature would inevitably surpass the 103.6 degrees of the previous day. However, around noon, clouds suddenly appeared, obscuring the sunlight, and the temperature did not rise. From 2:30 p.m. to 5:00 p.m., the scorching sun emerged from the clouds again, but fleeting clouds lingered, and sparse raindrops fell in the central district of the International Settlement, while the central district and suburbs of the French Concession, such as Xujiahui, experienced showers at noon. However, after 3:00 p.m., the rain stopped, and the sunlight from then on was weak and powerless, and the temperature dropped. The weather turned cooler, and although it was not a rain that ushered in autumn, the sudden change from oppressive heat to overcast skies was refreshing.</p>
<p>Oppressive Heat, Initial Showers</p>
<p>The hot weather has not subsided for days, and the weather was even more oppressive yesterday morning, reaching over 100 degrees in the early hours. Around 11:00 a.m., the sky was covered with dark clouds, and the sky suddenly became gloomy. Then, a sudden shower came, but this shower was only in the Xuhui area of the French Concession. Only a few raindrops were found in other nearby areas. However, although the rain was slight, it slightly diminished the oppressive heat, so the weather was slightly cooler in the afternoon. Moreover, autumn begins this afternoon, the hot summer has passed, and the weather may become cooler.</p>
<p>Inspection of Quarantine Certificates in the International Settlement</p>
<p>Since the authorities of the International Settlement announced that citizens must hold a quarantine certificate to be allowed to pass through the International Settlement, otherwise they will not be allowed to enter the International Settlement, armed detectives have been stationed at various intersections on the border of the International Settlement in recent days, assisted by members of the Self-Defense Corps, who are divided into entrances and exits at each intersection to strictly inspect quarantine certificates. Any citizen who does not have the certificate is prohibited from entering or leaving. The enforcement is very strict from morning to night.</p>
<p>Sharp Increase in Number of Exposed Corpses Due to Intense Sun</p>
<p>The scorching sun is rampant, and the oppressive heat is unbearable. As a result, the general refugees and beggars in the two concessions, without shelter, are exposed to the scorching sun and suffer from starvation, resulting in a sharp increase in deaths. According to the Pushan Villa, from August 1st to 6th, the number of corpses collected and buried by the villa due to the above reasons was: 51 large and 95 small on the 1st, 47 large and 74 small on the 2nd, 45 large and 83 small on the 3rd, 35 large and 88 small on the 4th, 31 large and 84 small on the 5th. The previous day was one of the hottest days, and the number of corpses increased sharply, with 56 large and 124 small.</p>
<p>Intensified Vaccination Efforts</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Times" reported that about 60,000 people have been vaccinated in the two concessions, of which 11,030 applied for vaccination in the French Concession, and 37,726 were residents of the International Settlement. As of now, one million people have been vaccinated in the French Concession, with 45,000 still to be vaccinated. At the same time, the International Settlement has vaccinated 1.5 million people. As of Wednesday evening, 942 cholera cases had been discovered in the Chinese area, of which 153 people had died. According to a report from the French Concession authorities, a total of 314 people in the area have been infected this year, but 188 of them have not yet been confirmed as cholera patients. The number of deaths is 318. The International Settlement has so far discovered 214 cases, of which 44 people have died, including one foreigner. On Wednesday, the Health Department of the Municipal Council reported that it had received reports of 25 new cholera cases, with 9 deaths, and the French Concession reported 15 cases, with one death.</p>
<p>Overcrowding at Outpatient Clinics of Infectious Disease Hospitals</p>
<p>The hot weather has lasted for more than 20 days, and the heat wave is getting worse every day. The epidemic is also becoming more severe, which is a major threat to the health of the city's residents. According to inquiries at the Shanghai Infectious Disease Hospital at 25 Yuqiaoqing Road, the number of outpatients yesterday (August 6th) reached as many as 963, which is one of the highest number of outpatients in the hospital's 24-year history. The prevalence of the epidemic is really frightening. The doctors and staff of the hospital are busy day and night saving patients. If the heat wave does not subside and there is no rain for a long time, the number of infected people will increase, which is very worrying. I hope that citizens will pay attention to food hygiene to maintain their health.</p>
<p>Third Isolation Hospital Opens</p>
<p>A public notice from the Information Office of the Municipal Council stated that the Third Chinese Isolation Hospital established by the bureau at 9 Singapore Road will be opened at 12:00 noon this (8th) morning to accommodate patients with infectious diseases. The two Chinese isolation hospitals on Beihai Road and Xinzhazhi Road will stop admitting patients until further notice. This public notice is hereby issued.</p>
<h3>Bread Rationing Begins Yesterday; All Purchases Must Be Made with a Certificate; Bread Prices Slightly Increased</h3>
<p>The "Shanghai Times" reported that the bread rationing plan adopted by the authorities will be implemented from today (July 7th). Residents of the International Settlement, the French Concession, and the Western District who have not received rice rations will be able to purchase only 10 taels of bread per person per day from today. It is noted that as of yesterday (July 6th), there were no restrictions on the sale of bread, but in the future, those who have not received rice rations must purchase bread with a bread ration certificate. There are two types of ration certificates: white and yellow. The white certificate is issued to residents who have not received rice rations, and the certificate holder can purchase 10 taels of bread. The yellow certificate is issued to residents who have already received rice rations, and the certificate holder can only purchase 4 taels of bread. Bread ration certificates are issued once a month, divided into daily coupons. According to the authorities, bread cannot be purchased in advance, and the validity period of each coupon is limited to the date printed on the paper and the next day. Moreover, these ration certificates are issued per person and not per household. Even children between the ages of two and five have this certificate to ensure fair distribution. In the future, the amount of flour that bakeries can receive will be limited to the amount listed on the ration certificates that the store returns to the authorities. All bakeries have received the yellow and white ration certificates issued by the authorities, the number of which is determined according to the total amount of bread consumed previously applied for by the residents.</p>
<p>A public notice from the Information Office of the Municipal Council stated that the bureau deems it necessary to slightly increase the price of bread. The revised prices will be effective from August 10th: (1) Wholesale: 2.50 yuan per pound; (2) Retail: 2.75 yuan per pound. The price of bread of different sizes will be calculated proportionally. For details, please refer to the bureau's announcement No. 6037.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Establishes Branch of the International Red Cross; Representative in China, Mr. Ilal, Returns to Shanghai; Successful Negotiations with the Japanese Authorities in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that Mr. Igl, the representative of the International Red Cross in China, has returned to Shanghai after going to Hong Kong to establish a branch of the International Red Cross. He told reporters that he was very satisfied with this trip. However, he cannot comment on the achievements of this trip, his experiences, and the Red Cross's work plans in China until the accumulated documents have been processed. It is reported that as a result of Mr. Ilal's discussions with the local Japanese authorities during this trip to Hong Kong, the work of the International Red Cross in China will be expanded. For example, arrangements will now be made to transport letters and gifts from Shanghai to civilians and prisoners of war detained in Hong Kong. Mr. Ilal left Shanghai on June 12 and arrived in Hong Kong in ten days. A month later, he obtained permission from the Japanese authorities to establish a Hong Kong branch of the International Red Cross, which will be headed by Mr. Qin Tai'er. Mr. Ilal also inspected the prisoner-of-war camps and civilian internment camps in Hong Kong and found the facilities to be quite complete. On the way back, Mr. Ilal made a brief stop in Guangzhou, but only passed through and did not have any Red Cross mission there.</p>
<h3>Tekakura Maru Repatriation Includes Nationals of All Countries</h3>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that Japanese consulate officials recently told reporters that the repatriation ship Tekakura Maru, which is scheduled to leave Shanghai on August 16 for Loreno Marques, will not only carry American nationals. Only a small number of American women who have married British consulate or diplomatic officials will be attached to the ship under the names of the officials' family members. There is no further news regarding plans to send a fifth repatriation ship. It is generally speculated that this fifth ship is the Conte Verde, but this has not been officially confirmed. The Tekakura Maru will carry 900 repatriated British nationals, many of whom are Shanghai residents. Japanese consular officials stated that the Tekakura Maru is reserved for carrying British and European Allied nationals. It is a mistake to say that the ship is repatriating American nationals. However, the fifth ship may carry many Allied nationals, including Americans.</p>

<h3>Numerous Ruthless Bandits Arrested; Habitual Offenders Implicated in Kidnappings and Robberies; Interrogation Concluded, Sentencing Scheduled</h3>
<p>Sun Boqun's son, Yi Chen, the scion of a Shanghai flour magnate from Anhui province, was kidnapped at 8:30 AM on September 12th of last year. He was in his private automobile en route to school when, at the corner of Moganshan Road and Tokyo Road, he was abducted and his whereabouts were unknown. A letter was sent to his family demanding a hefty ransom. Eventually, after a payment of 45,000 yuan, he was released. Subsequently, Chinese Detective Feng Baishun, along with Detectives Liu Zhaonian, Liu Shuxun, and Guo Xiangyao from the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) Police, apprehended the suspects: Li Chunbao, Guan Shoushan, and Wang Echang, all from Jiangbei. They were transferred to the court for detention pending further proceedings. Investigations revealed that between September of last year and June of this year, these individuals, along with the fugitive Gu Acai and the convicted criminal Shen Zongbao (surnames deliberately obscured), kidnapped Dr. Yao Junian outside No. 819 Wuding Road and abducted the wealthy merchant Ying Jipin near No. 895, Xiaoshadu Road. Additionally, they kidnapped Cai Lanzhou at No. 1074 Mabai Road and robbed Su Xingxing, an SMC watchman, of a pistol with six bullets at No. 1243 Gordon Road, and also stole several hundred yuan worth of property from Chen Zhengxiang's residence at No. 37 Carter Road. The police department filed a public prosecution for extortion and robbery, requesting severe punishment. However, Sun Boqun and his son Yi Chen, along with Dr. Yao Junian, wealthy merchant Ying Jipin, and Cai Lanzhou, did not appear in court to testify, nor did they send representatives. When questioned, the three defendants gave evasive answers. Judge Zhao Dui ordered them to remain in custody pending sentencing on a scheduled date.</p>

<h3>Terror Drill Conducted Yesterday in the Jing'an Temple Road Area</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 11:00 AM, a terror drill was conducted by the authorities in the Jing'an Temple Road area of the International Settlement. All intersections along Jing'an Temple Road were blocked off. The lockdown was lifted and traffic resumed at 11:35 AM.</p>
<h3>The Mystery of the Resident Certificates</h3>
<p>Resident certificates, applied for by residents in the French Concession from their respective police stations, are, according to regulations, supposed to be stamped by the head of household, "Jia" head, and "Bao" head, and also require the attachment of a health certificate. However, it is reported that these application forms were submitted to the police stations several months ago, and yet the Bao heads, Jia heads, and heads of household have not received the certificates to distribute to the tenants. Whether there are instances of obstruction or extortion of fees remains unknown.</p>
<h3>SMC Abolishes Bran Purchase Scheme</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued Notice No. 6036, announcing the cancellation of Notice No. 5675 (issued on December 18th of last year) and Notice No. 5860 (issued on April 16th of this year) regarding the registration and purchase of bran. However, regulations stipulate that permits are still required for the movement, import, or export of bran within the International Settlement. Permits can be obtained from Office No. 801 of the SMC, located at No. 209 Jiangxi Road.</p>
<h3>Fire at Anhe Temple Road</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 5:30 PM, a fire broke out suddenly at a residence with the surname of someone at No. 65, Lane 361, Anhe Temple Road in Shanghai. The fire brigade rushed to the scene and extinguished the blaze in about an hour and a half. As a result, the entire Western-style house was burned down, resulting in substantial losses.</p>
<h3>Report on the Shanghai Buddhist Charity Congee Kitchen</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Buddhist Charity Congee Kitchen has already opened. Most of the staff are monks. Congee is distributed exclusively to the elderly and children. Those seeking congee enter through the Guandi Temple gate from Kongjia Lane, in an endless stream. They first go to the verification point to obtain a token and then collect their congee, sitting in the corridors to eat. Upon finishing, they recite Buddhist scriptures and exit. The congee served by the kitchen is reportedly pure and delicious. Each person receives about 40 "liang" of congee. Consequently, many elderly people bring one or two children with them to share the meal. Considering the quota of 3,000 people, the kitchen is actually providing relief to approximately 10,000 individuals. Congee is served from 7:30 AM to 10:00 AM daily. At a time when rice is as precious as pearls and firewood as cinnamon, the kitchen is providing tangible benefits to the poor, which is truly commendable.</p>
<h3>Community Service</h3>
<p>Lost Keys: A ticket seller at the Eastern Electric Company, Mr. Cheng, found three keys at the intersection of Tianjin Road and Shanxi Road at 12:30 PM on August 6th. Anyone who has lost keys may inquire at the information desk of this newspaper from 6:30 AM to 5:30 PM daily and ask for Mr. Cheng.</p>

<h3>The Living Standards of Chinese Employees, Compiled by the Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council (3)</h3>
<p>Percentage Distribution of Monthly Household Expenditures on Consumer and Non-Consumer Goods</p>
<p>For employee households, expenses on food and housing account for 62.63% of total expenditure, while clothing and miscellaneous items account for only 37.18%. Generally, the higher the income, the lower the percentage spent on food and the higher the percentage spent on miscellaneous items. During this period of rapid inflation, food and housing costs are the largest, with rice and fuel being particularly burdensome. Expenditures on clothing and miscellaneous items have decreased significantly. The percentage spent on food is very high for both employee and worker households, while the percentage spent on miscellaneous items is lower for worker households. Living standards cannot be fully illustrated by category percentages alone. The following table shows the composition of consumer expenditures.</p>
<p>Note 1: Consumer expenditures plus non-consumer expenditures equal 100.</p>

<p>Deficit</p>
<p>For the employee class, the average monthly income of the head of household and family members is 611.35 old legal tender yuan, while expenditures reach 885.43 yuan, resulting in a shortfall of 274.08 yuan. Even with other income, there is still a shortfall of 197.05 yuan. In addition to the above income and expenditures, the accounting records also include "other income" and "other expenditures," such as borrowing, withdrawing bank deposits, lending money, and making savings, etc., which are either received and then repaid, or paid and then received. These are not considered actual income and expenditures, but are used to offset the balance. Other income averages 282.27 old legal tender yuan per household per month, and other expenditures are 35.62 yuan. Total income, i.e., monthly income, other income, and other income combined, is 970.65 old legal tender yuan. Total expenditures, i.e., consumer expenditures, non-consumer expenditures, and other expenditures combined, are 921.05 yuan, resulting in a remaining balance of 49.60 yuan. The accounting records show that expenditures exceed deposits, borrowing exceeds repayments. On the other income side, 50 households withdrew deposits, 76 borrowed money, 38 recovered debts, 27 sold old goods, and 10 pawned items. On the other expenditure side, 40 households had some savings, 17 had life insurance, 1 invested, 11 lent money, and 10 repaid debts. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War more than four years ago, savings have been gradually depleted, and it has become increasingly difficult for those struggling to make ends meet, even with borrowing. All of this is detailed in the records. The summary of income and expenditure is as follows:</p>
<p>Note 3: Includes those who board and servants</p>
<p>Note 4: Does not include those who board and servants</p>

The opening price of the Chinese Wind Company was chaotic, and it also saw a slight decrease. The rest saw little gain or loss. Overall, market sentiment has stabilized, and transaction volumes are weak. A table of stock prices is provided below.</p>
<h3>Cheap Beans Arriving Continuously; Bran Demand Weak</h3>
<p>Retail sales of beans remain relatively brisk, but with frequent sales of cheap beans, price increases are difficult. The market is stable. 80 bags of Tianjin green beans were sold at 132 yuan for high-quality beans and 224 yuan for mid-grade beans. 20 bags of Chongming red beans were sold at 164 yuan, and 30 bags of sand silkworm beans were sold at 113 yuan.</p>
<p>The supply and demand for dried sweet potatoes were balanced yesterday, and the market was stable. 40 bags of Jiangbei dried sweet potatoes were sold at 105 yuan. There were also 10 bags of sweet potato flour on the market, priced at 215 yuan per "sima dan."</p>
<p>Sales of bean cakes were slow. A spot transaction of 1,500 pieces of Liuhe Stack bean cakes from the Luodian gang for the month of June was sold at 62 yuan.</p>
<p>Demand for bran remains weak, and market conditions are still soft. 150 small bags of Sansin bran from the May 28th stack were sold at 96 yuan.</p>
<p>Cheap beans from the local area continue to arrive, totaling no less than 10,000 bags. The military distribution team has started distributing them.

Coarse sugar stocks opened up 0.5 yuan and closed at 299 yuan, up 1 yuan overall. Red sugar stocks opened at 285 yuan, unchanged from the 4th. Taiche white B Mark traded at 210 yuan. A total of 1,200 bags were traded.</p>
<h3>Retail Sales of Local Nails Remain Good</h3>
<p>Retail sales of local nails from nail shops remain steady, with a continuous stream of daily transactions. Market conditions are quite lively. However, wholesale transactions are lacking. Purchases by the Nanyang gang are no longer as strong as they once were, which has had a significant impact on sales of local factory nails. However, the current production volume of local nails has reached its lowest limit, so there is not much stock circulating in the market. For the time being, there is no sign of an imbalance between supply and demand. The current price is 750 yuan per barrel (Beisi).</p>
<h3>The Reasons for the Shortage of Japanese Cigarettes: Market Prices and Factory Prices Have Not Yet Converged; Factory Goods Are Difficult to Distribute, but Retail Sales Are Brisk</h3>
<p>The market prices of British and American cigarettes are fluctuating. Factory announcements about distribution have weakened market sentiment. Japanese cigarettes continue to be in short supply because retail sales are very strong. There is no news from the factories about distribution. This is largely because factory prices and market prices have not yet converged, causing the market to gradually rise. Big British Brand cigarettes are priced at 8,200 yuan, Old Blade cigarettes at 5,150 yuan, Product Sea cigarettes at 4,400 yuan, and Five Flowers cigarettes at 3,150 yuan, down 50 to 100 yuan from the previous day. Little Fairy cigarettes are priced at 3,750 yuan, up over 100 yuan. Japanese Golden Gun cigarettes are priced at 1,550 yuan, Red Rose cigarettes at 1,195 yuan, Golden Building cigarettes at 1,700 yuan, Full Luck cigarettes at 1,580 yuan, Ten-Piece Full Luck cigarettes at 1,650 yuan, and Guide cigarettes at 1,350 yuan. The prices of domestic Golden Mouse cigarettes are 1,500 yuan, Beautiful cigarettes are 1,800 yuan, and Pyramid cigarettes are 3,050 yuan. Market conditions are stable.</p>

<h3>Records of Summer Song (1)</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>I have an ailment, I love theater. It is the seventh and eighth months, and the drought and heat are oppressive. Even when living at home, I sweat like rain, and I am even less willing to go to the theater to watch plays. However, during social gatherings with friends, when there are actors present, with their laughter and conversation, and sometimes their loud singing, I forget the heat, which is also a pleasure. I will record them one by one to leave a trace.</p>
<p>Ji Yuliang</p>
<p>In early July, the Jiang residence held a gathering of string and bamboo instruments and clear singing. More than twenty people arrived as scheduled. Counting, most of them sang old male roles. Before I arrived, Ji Yuliang had already sung several excerpts. Since I was late and did not hear them, I especially asked Yuliang to sing the "Suddenly I Hear My Mother" excerpt from "Executing the Son." He readily agreed. Amidst the "Huqin" and "Xipi Daoban," he sang the "Angering Yang" excerpt, his voice loud and deafening. He used a "ga" tune on the word "laugh" in "Laughing at the Heroes," high, wide, and powerful, moving the dust with his voice. He and Song Baoluo can be called two eccentrics for their "ga" tunes. Tan Fuying's voice is wide and bright, and is generally recognized as excellent, but he has exhausted his intelligence to make his "ga" tune high enough. Now that Ji and Song are both in Shanghai, their singing is not yet excellent, but whenever they encounter a "ga" tune, it seems effortless, and exceptionally rich. They are truly two eccentrics. After Yuliang finished singing, I insisted on singing the following "Daoban." Yuliang refused, saying there was nothing to listen to. The host, Mr. Jiang, an expert in opera, explained from the side that the "Executing the Son Daoban" was too tiring. He suggested changing the Daoban to "Cannon Fire Shakes Heaven and Earth." He meant the "Xipi Daoban" from "Conquering Taiping." Yuliang agreed, but this caused a laughable incident. All the guests burst out laughing. It turned out that a certain private "Qinshi" of Yuliang thought that he was singing the "Erhhuang Daoban" from "Conquering Taiping," "Wearing a Purple-Gold" excerpt, so he played the "Erhhuang Daoban" prelude. Coincidentally, Ji Yuliang was absent-minded, and sang the "Cannon Fire" excerpt of the "Erhhuang Daoban" following the music. After singing "One Sound," he should have sung "Shakes Heaven and Earth," but Yuliang realized that he was singing an "Erhhuang" melody that he did not sing, so he stopped singing and turned to say, "What's going on?" At this time, Yuliang had a slightly shy look on his face. He said again, "Wrong, let's start over, sing Wearing a Purple." Only then did the guests realize that he had sung it wrong, and they all burst out laughing. Wang Liang turned his face to the wall, preparing to sing again. I thought he was embarrassed, so after singing "Thank you for your services, Madam," the guests applauded.</p>
<p>Chen Dahe</p>
<p>Mr. Chen is a famous amateur singer from Hangzhou, who sings in the Tan style. I met him briefly six or seven years ago, but did not hear him sing. I heard that he was invited to Hankou to sing opera, and he had a colleague, the Hunan "Qingyi" amateur singer Zhu Xiaoqiu. This is a recent event. Now he has repeatedly scheduled to perform "Golden Stage," though it has not yet come to fruition, I imagine he is not returning. I specially asked him to sing. Chen sang the excerpt "From the Day He Returned from Court" from "Hongyang Cave," his voice excellent. He sang the Tan style officially, his tone was between "Ruangong Tiao," and his high notes were extremely bright. His singing technique is above par. There are some subtle details that he has not yet achieved, but this is due to his age. Mr. Chen is only about twenty years old, with delicate features and a figure similar to Zhao Peixin. I have not seen him sing on stage, and do not know what it will be like. If his performance can be seen, then going professional would bring him fame.</p>
<h3>A Plethora of Pure Singing Venues After the Rain</h3>
<p>— Sick Dove</p>
<p>The pure singing of female singers has a long history. In the late Qing Dynasty, "Huifang" and "Xiao Guang Han" and others rose up with novel appearances, taking advantage of the times. They were named book venues, and the singers were mostly from brothels, euphemistically called "proofreaders." These people used singing as a front to attract their prostitution business. The audience could order plays at will, and there were girls serving cigarettes and tea, providing a great deal of sensory pleasure. After the Xinhai Revolution, "Tianxian" and "Qunxian" and other trendy opera troupes emerged, and these kinds of book venues gradually declined. Around the tenth year of the Republic of China, amusement parks sprang up, and many of them set up pure singing groups of female singers, renamed "Qunfang Huichang" (Gathering Fragrances Singing). At that time, the Gonghe Hall of the Great World was the most outstanding. The lineup of Qunfang was the most complete. People who visited the Great World at that time mostly gathered in the Gonghe Hall. The grand scene can be imagined. In recent years, this trend has revived. Before the war, "Xiao Guang Han," "Shidai" (Era), and "Changle" (Eternal Joy) were the first three to start classes, vying for customers and competing fiercely. Later, they all closed down due to sluggish business. So far, the only one that survives is "Xiao Guang Han." Recently, the person in charge of "Shidai" pioneered a new gimmick of female singers sitting with guests, stimulating the psychology of the audience, and achieved great results. As a result, business was booming, and it was very popular for a while. Others were envious and opened similar businesses one after another. "Gaole" (High Joy) was created first, followed by "Juele" (Noble Joy). In addition, "Da Luotian" (Great Luo Heaven), although the facilities are simpler, the lineup of female singers is very strong. "Zhang Yuan" newly opened an open-air singing venue, which is unique, and business is not weak. "Tiangong" (Heavenly Palace), which opened yesterday, is not small in scale and has quite elaborate facilities, and is indeed a strong enemy of "Juele." It is said that "Tiangong" has programs such as Pingjin drum besides Peking Opera singing, which is another fresh trick. As for those that are being prepared but have not yet opened, there are "Changle," "Tong Yu Chun," "Renxin," and the old site of the Shanghai Ballroom. However, at present, everything is expensive, and the internal decoration costs are huge, and the talent pool of female singers is limited. The supply is less than the demand, and I am afraid it will not be enough to distribute. Some say that Shanghai people are the most imitative. Seeing that others can do it, they follow suit, regardless of whether there is certainty in the future. A blind man on a blind horse is unlikely to avoid failure. This is the same as the money houses and tobacco shops in the previous period, and the insurance companies and stock companies recently. I am afraid that they will not be able to maintain it in the near future and will close down one after another, becoming a historical relic of the times.</p>
<h3>A Record of Listening to Music with Gold</h3>
<p>— Ji Ya</p>
<p>Since childhood, the author has been fond of Peking Opera. When I was studying in Beiping with Luo Jun Tiechen, I often went to listen to opera in my spare time to entertain myself, and Luo Jun devoted himself to studying and imitating, sparing no effort, and has continued to do so to this day. The author, however, has insufficient funds and is constrained by secular affairs. Although I have a penchant for scabies, I can only listen to others sing loudly, while I remain silent. Therefore, I once said that although singing opera is a minor skill, it is not enough to talk about it without talent. First, you must have capital, second, you must have clear pronunciation, third, you must have agile movements, and fourth, you must be able to understand the details. With all four, then you can have room to spare. For example, those who are good at calligraphy can use the brush freely, and no matter whether it is Yan, Liu, Ou, or Su, they can learn their spirit at once. As for those who are not good at calligraphy, even if they spend a lot of effort, they will only be scribbling, and do not want to be like a god, so I can say with certainty that playing is not an easy thing. There are many amateur opera troupes in Shanghai, and some of them have a long history, but those who can go on stage and arouse the audience's interest are really rare. The few that the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital colleagues Fuyuan Branch invited to perform a charity performance, such as Zhao Jun Peixin, Zhang Jun Zhesheng, Wang Jun Qijun, and Sun Jun Junxiang, can be called the top talents among Shanghai amateur opera singers. I have admired Zhesheng and Qijun several times before. As for Zhao Jun Peixin, I have heard of him for a long time, but I have never heard him sing. A few days ago, I went to the Shenbao newspaper office, and the editor asked me to write about this golden charity performance to fill the entertainment column of Shenbao. I had not played this tune for a long time, so I did not dare to serve at first. But with the strong encouragement of my old friends, I could not refuse the kindness. Although the heat was suffocating, I could still listen to the opera of Zhao Jun Peixin here, which was also a blessing to my ears, so I tried it temporarily.</p>
<p>On the first day, I drove there, but it was a bit late, and the hospital was already full. Fortunately, Sun Jun Lantian gave me a warm reception, so it was not a wasted trip. At that time, the performance of "Beating Yan Song" by Zhang Zhesheng and Wang Qijun was coming to an end. Although I could not see the whole picture, I could still see their proficiency from the bits and pieces. After the end of "Beating Yan Song", after a short break, "Si Lang Visits His Mother" was performed. After a rush of wind, suddenly saw Zhao Jun Peixin, a famous amateur opera singer, who had been famous for a long time, slowly walk out of the stage in the midst of simultaneous electric lights and thunderous cheers. The costume was dignified and luxurious, and the pace was in harmony with the rhythm, which was not different from the professionals. It is difficult to achieve this without in-depth research. The two sentences of the prelude, "The golden well locks the wutong, and a long sigh follows a gust of wind," were clear and charming, winning the applause of the audience. I could not help but applaud him. It was not like the followers who echoed the voice of the audience, but it was indeed pleasing to the ear and to the heart, and it was spontaneous. People said that it had the flavor of Ma Lianliang, but when I listen to opera, I never distinguish its genre. As long as I feel that the charm is charming and makes the audience happy, the art is already superb, so why bother to discuss its genre. With Zhao Jun's accurate and crisp enunciation and the free use of his capital, he can create his own genre, and there is no need to limit himself to Ma. When reading the line "Thinking about it, it is so sad," a kind of depressed and tragic situation of tears following the voice was fully expressed, and the audience praised it endlessly. The Xipi slow beat "Yang Yan Hui sits in the palace courtyard and sighs..." was sung flawlessly. From the second to the sixth beat to the sentence "My mother leads the people to come to the northern barbarians," he won another full house of applause. Several allegros were as fast as carrying beads, and the words were clear, which was really rare. Then Sun Jun Junqing took over and sang "Going Out of the Pass to See Mother." I felt it was too hot, so I failed to hear the end of the song and left. The next day was Zhao Jun Peixin and the famous actress Jin Suqin's "Bao Yun Deng." I was attracted by Peixin's artistic talent, and Jin Suqin had not performed for a long time, so her art should be more advanced. So I drove there again after dinner. When I arrived, "Picking Hua Che" was being performed by Gao Xueqiao, a famous actor of the hospital, who played Gao Chong. His kung fu was indeed good. Then "Shi Lian Deng" was performed. This play is a student play that emphasizes singing and acting. Zhao Jun's shaking board "I heard that the two delicate children killed someone, poured cold water on their heads and embraced ice" was light, clear, vigorous, and the allegro "In the past, there was a lonely bamboo gentleman" was new and charming, and won a lot of applause. Jin Suqin's Erhuang slow beat "Ying is not a slave who does not listen to discipline" was clear, euphemistic, pleasant to the ear. The two of them worked meticulously and were a perfect match. It is commendable that famous actors can have unique art as a career. As for Zhao Jun, who is an amateur opera singer, to have this kind of skill, it is really a sight to behold. Sun Jun Junqing's drum beating in "Beating Cao" was as fast as ten thousand horses galloping, as light as a breeze moving bamboo, and the striking method was infinitely changeable. Those who have not deeply understood the samadhi in this are also unlikely to achieve this. On the third day, Zhao Jun Peixin's "Black Basin Account," I wanted to listen carefully to his anti-Erhuang, but because of the weather, it was sultry and oppressive, so I had to give it up. I am very grateful to Sun Jun Lantian for his sincere hospitality this time.</p>
<h3>Three Sentences Cannot Leave the Main Business</h3>
<p>— At Least a Storyteller</p>
<p>Before the war, the most lively place for storytelling venues was only in the Nanshi Yimiao Garden. However, each had its own sales channel. The first venue could not make mistakes. For example, the Chaihang Hall must invite the most well-behaved storyteller. Unless it was the late famous artist Guo Shaomei's late father Cao Anshan and others who were most suitable, it was because the place was full of old listeners who did not seek fancy tricks, but must be economical and practical, naturally, this kind of book could not satisfy their hope. When I first came to Shanghai, I wanted to occupy this place, but unfortunately the movement failed.</p>
<p>When the Shanghai war broke out, the Nanshi storytelling venues closed down one after another, and Chaihang Hall was no exception. To this day, it has not yet recovered, alas!</p>
<p>In the past, the Deliyi Teahouse also had storytelling venues, divided into upstairs and downstairs. The listeners there were mostly idle classes or fashionable people. There were often couples holding hands in and out. They all loved to listen to romantic songs and interesting anecdotes, so the most suitable ones were the storytellers who could both speak and sing, such as Ban Bokang and Xu Yunzhi, who were all the stars of the venue, and could also be full of customers every day like Chaihang Hall. It is strange to say that Deliyi is only a few steps away from Chaihang Hall, but the listeners in the two places are in inverse proportion. If there is a mistake, it is a small matter, it must be two Wutai Mountains, it is really a hair's breadth, a thousand miles away.</p>
<p>Correction To the editor: I have read the article "Remembering the Amateur Singer Zhao Peixin" in the entertainment section of the fifth day, which states that the chairman of our society, Shao Changling, donated 25,000 yuan alone. After investigation, this is not in line with the facts. The money was raised by Shao from relatives and friends, and was not donated by individuals. I am deeply afraid that the outside world does not understand the truth, so please correct it in your column. I am very grateful for your help. Sincerely, Lecheng Peking Opera Society.</p>
<h3>Lang De Shan Takes the Stage Again</h3>
<p>Technician Lang Deshan, who previously took the stage at the Great Light Theater, was warmly supported by the audience. Every show, day and night, was full of customers. Because the performance period was limited, there were many who missed it. I have heard that Lang Jun, in order to repay the kindness of his friends, will be performing his stunts with the Xin Wanhua Troupe at the Nanjing Theater again, starting this Sunday. The right picture is a recent portrait of Lang Jun.</p>
<h3>Sailing in the Same Boat</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(Seven) Swift Thunder</p>
<p>The next morning, it was still snowing lightly. At noon, the snow stopped. Mrs. Ye Er said, "The snow can't be said to be bad, it's auspicious snow. It would be better if it fell earlier, if it could fall on the day before New Year's Eve." There were three or four sparrows jumping around on the roof, jumping and looking for food in the snow. Standing in Shide Hall and looking outside, you could see the treetops outside the open space. Of course, there were no leaves. The bare branches were piled with white lines of clouds. A gust of wind blew, and the snow fell down in chunks. The yellow dog dragged its tail and strolled in from outside the gate. It just walked in a straight line, leaving its plum blossom footprints all the way. Cui Zhen saw that the snow had stopped and called Ah Xing to take the iron sickle and dustpan to help Magpie sweep the snow. Wei Cheng stood blankly in the Shuangmei Study and said, "Don't sweep, don't sweep, leave it for a day to see. Tomorrow, wait for the snow to melt a part before sweeping." Cui Zhen didn't understand what he meant, thinking that Wei Cheng had another crazy idea. Mrs. Ye Er said, "Scholars all like snow. His old man, his father, and his uncle all have this idea."</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, by evening, the wind stopped. It started snowing again. Mrs. Ye Er secretly went to see what Wei Cheng was doing. When she looked, he was not in the Shuangmei Study. She walked from inside the house and went around to his bedroom, but he was not in the bedroom either. This was a bit strange. She called out and walked to the Shuangmei Study again. She called out again. Then she discovered that Wei Cheng was in a room inside the Shuangmei Study. Mrs. Ye Er said, "What are you doing?" Wei Cheng said, "I'm not doing anything." Mrs. Ye Er looked inside and saw that there were books and letters spread out on the table, probably writing. Mrs. Ye Er said, "Are you writing a letter?" Wei Cheng said, "Yes." Mrs. Ye Er said, "You can't tell people the words in the will." Wei Cheng said, "Aunt, I know this. Now, only I, aunt, and Sister Cui Zhen know." (149)</p>
