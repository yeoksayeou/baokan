<h3 id="c1">本報七十週年紀念 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>今日爲本報七十周年紀念日，我們要寫一篇紀念文字，當握筆之頃，千頭萬緒，　觸多端，不知從何說起。回想七十年前的今天，本報創刋號與世人見面，和七十年後的此日，本報在大時代中繼續努力本位工作，這七十個年頭：這將近一個世紀的長時期內，我們幾於不能想像世界的進步怎樣，中國的進步又怎樣？我們可以槪括說一句，這七十年來是一個人類進化的偉大動盪時代——雖然照歷史家的看法，這不過是一個很短很短的歲月。</p>
<p>本報就在這個偉大的時代中長成，在今天，如果要把七十年來的大事，一一追紀，作有系統的陳述，則因爲事實與人力所限，絕對無此可能，並且這種艱鉅的整理爬梳工作，尙有待於今後專家之落筆。倘使將本報過去的事跡，一一描盡，我們又認為稍嫌繁瑣，因爲報紙係時代的反映，隨着時代以共相進展，與其說是報紙的進步，毋寗說是時代的進步之爲愈，一個報紙進展的過程，似乎也無庸多所聲述。然則將作何說？曰，姑述此時之觀念。至於這七十週年須作若何有意義的紀念，我們將予鄭重籌盡，俟之異日。</p>
<p>本報同人深切體認報紙是社會的公器，一方面指導輿論，是報紙的天職，但同時報紙亦當受輿論的指導。報紙的直接對象爲千萬之讀者，讀者之需要報紙與報紙之需要讀者是相對的。讀者對於一報的覜感若何而後始發生信心，則在於報紙平素紀載的精確和持論的公尤。精確和公允這兩貼，並非等閒所能獲致，必須經過若干歲月的陶冶，無數讀者的共鳴，而後始可養成，故報紙和讀者在精神上存在着一種潛在的聯繫，如影隨形，相互呼應，讀者須先自有其信心而後始可寄其信心於報紙——換言之，即讀者亦必須先具有精確的觀念和公允的態度是也。準是推　，又可知報紙的力量，亦即社會的力量，故曰報紙固可指導輿論，但同時亦將受輿論的指導。</p>
<p>由於時勢變遷的關係，報紙紀述，有時益為世人所責望，試微諸七十年來，本報所經過之艱辛，殆難闡述，後之視今，亦猶今之視昔，所可自矢者，即同人獻身新聞事業，一秉忠誠，凡過去所歷經的艱辛，盡屬此後吾人服務的策勉與敎訓。</p>
<p>近年以來，社會對於報紙的期望，視昔為更切，報紙之可貢獻於社會的，亦較前更多。如果遠者大者未能，一蹴而及，亦不妨先從近者小者入手。本報同人，自慚棉薄，年來嘗就時代需求，試作若干渺小的服務，惟當發　之始，亦曾拘定宗旨，竊願多作積極性的推動而不欲從事消極性的倡導。明知所可自效者，在此時亦僅以此而止，語云：「正其誼不謀其利，明其道不計其功，」同人的服務，蓋就事實所能允許的範圍，勉盡各個人的職責而巳。</p>
<p>同人以做報爲終身職業，在館員工，俱積有悠久歲月，午夜證昏，孳孳不息，前輩之工作於本報者如是，今人之執役於此者，亦莫不如是。木報有一傳統觀念，即同人認定做報爲神聖事業，應各具有信仰心，一若傳敎士之虔誠信仰宗敎然，其次應具有自尊心，唯其自尊也而後人尊之，憑信仰心與自信尊心的建立，然後在工作上方感覺到極大的興趣，鍥而不捨的當做終身事業。或謂此數年來，同人歷盡艱辛，本報所受的波折，不能算少，然而這不能算是波折，這是一種磨練，凡是一件有價値的事業，要有光明偉大的成就，必須經過千錘百煉，度過無限挫折，唯其如此，也就更能激發從業人員的勇氣和毅力，表現百折不回的決心，使事業益致於發揚光大。所以過去的磨練，正是我們的一種測騐，亦正是為將來樹立復興的丕基。</p>
<p>本報於民國十一年舉行五十周紀念時，曾有「最近之五十年」的刋行，民國十七年第二萬號時，亦曾刊佈紀念冊，至民國廿一年六十誕辰，又撮述槪况，印爲專冊，現在把所有的紀念書冊，羅致案頭，一一誦讀，胸中眞有說不出的情緒，譬如二萬號紀念冊中，有一段曾說：「編輯部中人，多有自一萬號以後，親手製成之者，深知此每號之中，無一不有點點心頭之血，醞於其內，無論爲功爲罪，而積此二萬號，亦殊非易易。」茲者距二萬號紀念，又已十有餘年，世界的變幻，人事的滄桑，令我們繼起工作者發生無限感喟。我們追思諸前輩經營本報的毅力和在困苦艱難中維持事業的卓越精神；我們益當奮發有爲，踏着已成的軌轍，邁開大步，向前進取。這是今日紀念七十誕辰同人所用以自勉；兼以就敎於愛護本報之讀者的。</p>
<p>諺有「人生七十古來稀之說，今本報欣逢古稀之慶而只能任其平淡過去，米免有「七十虛度」之感，然而我們認爲愈是平淡，愈是意義深遠。事業的生命和個人的生命，終不能相提並論，人生以七十爲貴，至於一件偉大事業，也許七十之年僅只能算是發軔，報紙的生命，是累積的，是繼續不斷的。本報日日與讀者相見，親切有如家人，我們願與讀者在時代洪流中自强不息，共相進展，以促進世界人類的光明和福祉，這也就是紀念本報七十週年的一點誠摯的希望。</p>

<p>若將邊陲再加劃分，則一般都以各河流域旁的區域為別，如柯蘭，托契，葛梅爾和　勃，都以流過各該區域的河名為名。</p>
<p>或以居民來劃分，亦無不可。如言卡埃　兩商的阿弗里第區，以富庶的柯蘭河流域為中心的土里區，以及華齊商人和瑪赫蘇特人居住的華齊里斯丹區是；俾路支包括孰勃區在內，住着巴桑種人，和俾路支人，俾路支一名，便是由此得來。</p>
<p>若以類別而論，這些人民盡屬一系，其容貌，言語，習慣和阿富汗的居民極相似，不過阿富汗有較為堅定地政府和手腕强硬的統治者，兩來甚久，已使阿富汗人較諸行政邊界外西北邊陲上的部落民族，稍守法律與秩序。</p>
<p>部落地帶素稱貧之，並無可供侵略者　掠的東西，並未在這地帶逗留過，但都向南進入富庶的印度。再者，部落地帶很難攻入，而古代的君王，都把戰爭當作買賣，只求　掠並佔據大片土地，加以統治。</p>
<p>故而這些部落始終獨處無擾：例如馬其頓的希臘人曾記述印度的薩泰格人與阿庇里替人，從其名稱和描寫看來，不難認明這些便是今日自稱為夏泰克人和阿弗里第人的民族。馬其頓人侵入印度的時期，比較　近，祗是一千年前的事情，可是薩泰格人和阿庇里替人被馬其頓人發現之前，或許已散居在那裏很久了。</p>
<p>部落地帶山岳起伏，一片荒瘠，頓時叫人想起蘇格蘭的高地區來，知道那裏的巴桑人必然　悍而當搶　家畜，打家　舍。這確是巴桑人的世傳職業，他們的心目中，祗知　掠，其他一切，都非所重。不過，時至今日，他們也潤明瞭這綠林勾當，已不若日時的油水富足，因而有些巴桑人已學會了開汽車，或駕船舶入海謀生；更有投効印度陸軍的，當了一陣士兵，却又害起懷鄕病來，戀戀不捨哪故土的崇山峻嶺，於是解甲歸山。</p>
<p>部落地帶因與外界久相隔絕，所以巴桑人具有特殊的本性，他們絕不承認管轄人，甚至已族的土　，也視若無覩。巴桑族的男子一味找自己家族中人，　牆雪門，算是光榮的大事，這種內爭的起源，却因自古已然而不可稽考了。觀此可知巴桑族男子個個備着武器，這種生活必然產生祗重一已，而不信任他人的結果。</p>
<p>山麓下一片平原，向後至印度河為止，這一部份，屬於印度本部，不過行政稍異：因為平原邊緣的亂山中，住着部落民族，所以這是無法避免的。西北邊省和傳路支境內的巡警，都　步槍，較重要而易受襲擊的村落，莫不置　步槍，以便巴桑人　由襲擊時，發給村中壯了迎擊。各安定區域中的巴桑人還和部落山脈中的同族人很相像，可是他們久受管轄，已成習慣，族門之風，為英方法律所不許，已趨消失；最重要的是他們已養成信任他人的性格，充當巡警和士兵，極幹練有為。</p>
<p>旅客游印，也許在孟買登岸，所見到的印度，和他意想中的情景，多少相同——一片炙如火焚的熱帶土地，滿目都是棕櫚樹和膚色黝黑，衣衫稀薄的印人，錯雜無致的　博平原上，有外國種的植物和禽畜，更有古代的廟宇，宮殿和堡壘，又可見到巨　聽得虎嘯，在在都叫旅客憶起故事書中所述的印度景色。然而，在西北部，所見到的，決不是意料中的印度，假使時在冬令，氣候寒冷，山頂積雪，入夜平原上凍冰，晨晚寒氣刺入，如　肌膚。</p>
<p>在那裏常遇的人膚色並不黝黑，而是白督如歐人，御羊皮衣，身體高大，眼珠作藍，靑，和灰色，褐紅的頭髮，活潑機警，較印度他處的人民愉快，笑口常開。</p>
<p>旅客恐怕沒有不寶貴自己生命的，如果不然，政府却，愛惜旅客的生命，不許其在部落地帶隨意遨遊。但旅客仍可遊歷沿部落地帶甚至該地帶以內的各地，舒適無處，一面硏究種族形式，和眺望商隊從阿富汗入印，這些商隊都由高大的駱駝載着氈毯，對印貿易；旅客又可獲見，浦溫達人一年一度的大移居，浦溫達人是阿富汗的部落，每逢天時轉寒，便率合族的男婦老幼移居印度北部：駱駝背上，負着一包包的貨物和家具，兩頰紅潤的孩童和小駱駝小犬，也載在駱駝背上，商隊和羊羣，都有高大的夢犬守衛着前進。</p>

<h3 id="c53">苞米與營養 <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— 莫名</p>
<p>自從食米的供應發生恐慌後，各種雜糧就紛紛跑上人們的餐桌。苞米之外，麥麩，小米，赤豆，黃豆等都有人拿來充飢。嘗試結果；有許多人覺得粗櫔不堪，食難下咽：有許多人却又覺得別有風味，廿之若飴。但就營養的價値而論，雜糧都是遠勝於白米的，因此不管你食難下咽，或者甘之若飴，它們一入了肚，就會在不知不覺中給你的健康堡壘加上一層鋼骨水泥。如此說來，在亂世吃不到白米飯，竟是「焉知非福」。</p>
<p>拿苞米來和白米相比，主要成分可說並沒有什麼不同。除了脂肪的含量苞米較多外，其他如蛋白質，澱粉，礦物質，纖維素都相差不多。但倘若再比較它們的維他命含量，優劣强弱就有顯著的差別了。現在試例表於下：（每百公分）</p>
<p>山上可見苞米在前三項中都佔絕對優勢，這並不是意外的事，因爲白米的精華原來在一層薄薄的米皮（糠）中，一碾二磨之後，早已損失殆盡。而苞米的富含維他命，我們從它的顏色也可以看出來；苞米的黃，正如蛋黃的黃，奶油的黄，黃豆的黃，橘子的黃—都是富含維他命的標識。不僅如此，苞米中也有黃白兩種，白的就遠不如黃的（上表所示都是黄苞米的數値）這也好比白薯的不如紅薯，白羅蔔的不如黄色的胡蘿蔔。</p>
<p>上面表中最後一項的烟鹼酸，苞米（特別是苞米粉）含得很少，這個缺點却不容忽視，因爲它也是一種十分重要的維他命，缺乏了就要生一種叫一蜀黍疹」（Pellagra）的病，是一種吃玉蜀黍（苞米）的人常患的病。去年市上曾有過一種沙利文的「維他命乙麵包」，這是用美國來的增加維他命的麵粉製的，裏面所增加的維他命除維他命乙一（即硫　素）外，還有一種就是烟鹼酸。（上表中的乳黃素就是舊稱維他命乙二，維他命乙現在可能包括十六種以上的營養素，這裏提到的三種是其中的最重要者。）</p>
<p>蜀黍疹舊稱「意大利癩病」，在美國因它的症狀是皮膚上發出紅色的炎疹，故又名一紅疫」。當初人們因見這種病十分普遍，都常它是流行性的傳染病，後來鏗科學家的硏究方才知是由於營養不良而起，直到近年眞相完全暴露—主要原因是爲了食物中缺乏烟鹼酸。十年以前美國南方密士失必河流域一帶的居民，因生活比較刻苦，日常以苞米粉爲主要食糧，患此病者累累以萬計，每年因此死亡的共有七十人之多，其後當局設法預防，但因膳食習慣不易改革，每年患者仍達十萬人以上，迄今猶未完全消滅。蜀黍疹在我國很少發現，不過連年戰爭，物價高漲，一般升斗小民，常苦餐飧不繼，營養問題自然更談不到，因此這種疾病極有法生的可能；近年來　滬兩地醫院的報吿已證實這種趨勢的存在了。</p>
<p>蜀黍疹的症狀相當複雜，一般的說起來，可有下例幾種</p>
<p>皮膚上發出紅色炎疹，手背，手腕，下臂等處最明顯。</p>
<p>炎，口腔炎，陰囊炎。</p>
<p>腸胃失調，食慾不振，泄瀉下痢等。</p>
<p>精神失常，重時甚至神經錯亂，癲狂昏厥。</p>
<p>一個吃苞米飯的人倘若發覺有上述症狀的傾向時，就應設法醫治或改良膳食。若病已沉重，除用菸　酸等藥劑急救外別無生途。</p>
<p>爲防患未然計，一般吃純苞米飯者應當要特別注意：日常須多吃綠色菜蔬，豆類，能稍吃些肉類更好。倘若用苞米和白米或豆類混合煮飯，其營養價値比單吃苞米或白米都要高，因爲單吃白米若不從其他來源得到豐富的硫胺素，就有生脚氣病的危險。附帶要提到的，就是洋秈米一般人以爲不如「大米」，這個觀念並不很對。從維他命的含量看來洋秈米只有比「大米」來得好，雖然好的並不多。不過，不論是那一種白米，它所僅僅保存的微量維他命都含在混合的米粉中，倘若淘洗得太透，仍將完全失去。同樣的，赤豆和黄豆在冷水中浸得久時，大量的乙種維他命就被浸了出來，這些水也不可以棄去。凡此都是講究營養者所不可不注意的。</p>

<p>宛如汽車</p>
<p>至駕駛方法、與汽車亦無分軒輊、上面裝置舵盤、駕駛者逢轉彎時、即輕易轉移、任何人能爲之、若自己駕駛、更爲經濟、而車廂內除駕駛者外、尙可駢坐一人、下面裝置脚踏鏈、幫同駛駕者脚踏、車行更速、前面可容二成人、後車廂可乘二孩童、</p>
<p>專製五年</p>

<p>輕快舒適</p>
<p>該輛自動車之優點、因輕快安全、坐位舒適、無顚簸之苦、外表式樣美觀、賽似汽車、其售價每輛六千元左右、目照會方面每半　納費祗有一百五十、較諸汽車捐費、亦俾宜多多、</p>

<p>— 胡樸安</p>
<p>從古史立塲闡明周易　為中國經術上之創見</p>
<p>樸安年十三四歲時，讀宋朱熹周易本義，一日問塾師曰，坤卦上六，龍戰於野，其血玄黄，普通之血，皆是紅色，何以龍血獨玄黄？究竟龍是何物？或曰，龍戰已久，其血巳乾，故有玄黄之色。塾師無以應，第曰，龍是神物，現在無有。一日又問曰，履卦卦辭，履虎尾，不咥人亨，六三，履虎尾，咥人凶。同一屐卦，而虎有咥人不咥人之分，是何緣故？塾師曰，不咥人所以亨，咥人所以凶也。又問曰，童男貞女，人所恒言，觀卦初六，童觀，小人道也。六二，闚觀女貞，亦可醜也。是觀童男，不過小人之道，闚觀女貞，則爲可醜之行，聖經早已言之矣。塾師怒曰，豈有聖經而爲如此之言乎，余曰，男女搆精，萬物化生，豈非聖　　言乎？精究竟是何物，如何搆法？旣搆之後，何以能化生萬物？塾師氣極不言，而盛怒有加，時適晚餐，余取一醃肉食之，喟然嘆曰，聖經眞不可信也。塾師詢問何故？余曰，噬嗑五六，噬乾肉，得黄金，假使這塊肉　得有黄金，豈非發了一點小財？塾師曰，爾眞是書痴，因唪然一笑而罷。</p>
<p>自是之後，余對於易經，滿腹狐疑，遂不之讀。三十歲以前，除周易本義外，關於周易之書，任何一種，皆未見過，不過問人言，周易是一種神秘不可知之書而巳。三十歲以後，始讀壬弼易注，孔穎達正義，周易折衷，程頤易傳，李鼎祚周易集解，李道半周易集解纂疏，始略知易學有漢宋之分，王弼易學，雖異於漢，而宋儒亦不宗之，惟程傳略有相似之處。但余雖讀過四五種易，而於易之大義，仍茫然也。於是擱置不讀者又數年。</p>
<p>民國五年，杭辛齋出袁世凱之獄，自言在獄中得易學眞傳。民國七八年，辛齋集合國會同人，講易於廣州，於是講易之風，盛極一時。上海有設周易學社者，其所編講義，凡潛水艇，轟炸機，無一不歸納於周易之中，迷信時代，以周易爲符咒，可以駭鬼，今則以周易爲兵器，可以打人矣。此種奇怪之說，雖未見辛齋之書，而君主立憲，爲同人象，民主立憲，爲大有象，日光七色，見象於賁，微生蟲變化物質，見象於蠱，乾位南力、乾爲冰，是早知有甫冰洋，化學之分劑，與象數合，此等之說，在辛齋易書中，時時見之。</p>
<p>余素有好奇之心，爲此等奇怪之說所激刺，於是父引起我之讀易，久之毫無所得。父久之，恍然自悟曰，縱有是說，不過偶合而已，即有合者，亦不過一大輪廓而已，決不能當科學書讀也，亦決無科學之價値也。但周易究竟是件甚麼東西，旣不是尙書之紀事，又不是春秋之紀年，旣不是詩之言文，又不是禮之言制，無已，只好把他當作卜筮之書，周易之卜筮，見於左傳頗多，惜古卜筮之法，無由徵騐，於是又取正續淸經解中易若干種讀之，以為在易漢學家書中，必可徵得若干古法也。不讀則巳，讀則卦氣，消息，辟卦，納甲，世應，飛伏，貴賤，貞悔，蒙氣等說，一時弄不淸楚。</p>
<p>時余方長敎國民大學，學生請開周易一課，尙時好也，余若以杭辛齋之書作課本，再穿鑿附會以說之，頗足以投一般學生之嗜好，余心竊不以爲然，於是自編一易經學講義，共二十三章，　緒論，　命名，　釋惑，　論卦，　論　，　論象，　十翼，　論互體，　論變卦，　論比例，　　闢圖，　　讀易法，　　兩漢易經學之派別，　　三國晋南北朝隋唐易經之派別，　　宋元明易經學之派別，　　淸代易經學之派別，　　易經之文字學，　　易經之文章學，　　易經之哲理學，　　易經之禮敎學，　　　易經之史地學，　　　易經之藝術學，　　　硏究易經之書目。余編此講義，不採用奇怪之說，亦不紆自己之意見，使學者讀此講義後，各以自己學力，去認識易經而已。除緒論一章外，，自命名至論比例九章，係易經中重要各部，採取各家之說成之，俾俾學者由此可以略知易經之大概。闢圖一章，本胡渭萬斯同之說，以河圖·洛書·先天·後天·六十叫卦方圓諸圖，是邵康之學，而非易學。自讀易法，至淸代易經學之派別五章，俾讀者由此可略知易經學之變遷。自易經文字學至易經藝術學六章，是我所有整理中國舊書之方法。無論書經，詩經，三禮，春秋，皆用此種方法整理之，可惜只做易經學，詩經學，兩種，其他書經，三禮，春秋，三種，只好祈諸來者而巳。最後一章，附關於研究易經之書目終焉。但是此種計畫，是失敗的，學生大半好新奇之說，我這本講義，旣無新奇之說，又不能言易經是一種甚書，學了以後，有甚麽用處，學生往往質問我，實無辭以對也。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c83">瑞士——世界樂園 <a href="#c83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— 璇</p>
<p>在這烽火連天的世界大戰中，舉世各國幾　都已捲入戰渦，土耳其等幾個國家，雖還保持着中立，但和大戰息息相關，隨時有不免參戰的可能；唯有位居歐洲，被圍在列强之間的瑞士，却始終置身事外，保持一片乾凈土地，不負世界樂園的美名。前年瑞士四週血戰方酣時，曾有法國和波蘭兵數萬名，逃入瑞士，幸而瑞士幅員雖小，却有一支實力勁强，受人尊敬的陸軍，將越界入境的法荷士兵，一一拘留，並嚴密守衛邊陲，力守中立，方才安然渡過戰爭的巨浪。</p>
<p>我們不妨在想像中作瑞士之遊，然而這不是遊山玩水的時候，而是想得悉一些關於瑞士陸軍的情形。在一處關卡入瑞士國境時，可見士兵兩名守衛着，身穿靑灰色戎衣，頭戴式樣特殊的鋼盔，其中一名顯而易見是個農民，粗手笨脚，身胚結實；另一個却像靑年學生。道時候，遊客便要向瑞士嚮導人問道·「瑞士民衆在承平時代，須服軍役多少年，或者，是否有職業性的軍隊？」且聽嚮導人如何解答：</p>
<p>瑞士國小，不足維持常備軍，祇有民軍制度，憲法訂定公民的基本仟務是服一個時期的軍役，若因身體不健全或在海外，都須繳稅代役。做軍官的若能體會士兵的感覺，雙方關係必極融洽，所以瑞士民衆服役，不問階級，一律同等待遇。關卡上的兩個衛兵，在社會上的地級顯然不同，可是在行伍中，穿着同樣的戎衣，都須服從命令。</p>
<p>「瑞士人民的言語和宗敎，也有差異。大約百分之七十一都操瑞士德語，百分之二十一操法語，百分之六操意語，百分之一操羅曼斯語（從古拉語變成）。人民信耶蘇新敎的佔百分之五十七，信天主敎的百分之四十一。可是他們都爲瑞士國旗所象微的共同目的，團結一致。</p>
<p>「瑞士的陸軍制度和他國的不同，它是用全國的男子組成的，以最輕的負擔，保持最高的防禦實力。靑年滿二十歲，都須入伍，受四個月的嚴密訓練，習用種種現代戰具。其後十二年內，舉行年操八次，每次十八天，期滿巳三十二歲，便歸入第二綫後備軍。直到四十歲，尙須受兩次操演，每次十八天。從四十歲到四十八歲，屬於國防軍，平時僅每年被召受檢閱一天。瑞士政府近曾頒令總動員時，將軍役年齡從四十八歲展至六十歲，而士兵階級的人民，至少須在役三十二年。</p>
<p>「士兵階級的公民，都有槍械發給，藏在自己家中，動員時祇須返家脫下便服，換上戎衣，便可携檢集會，所以一九一四年第一次大戰時，瑞士陸軍的動員，最先完成。民衆除年受十八天操演外，還須作步槍打靶演習，每年三十彈，如不及格，更須續受訓練。射擊在瑞士，有國技之稱，每個村莊，都有打靶塲，供男子練習，常舉行競賽，已成爲瑞士社交生活的要事之一。瑞士人民旣嫻射擊，軍隊又是純粹的防禦性質，所以人民在行伍的期限，可减至最低限度。自十六世紀以還，瑞士從未試圖擴張其領土，其唯一目的，祗在維護自由而已。」</p>

<p>——艾子新解之一</p>
<p>今夜艾子多喝了幾杯酒，昏沉沉地倒頭便睡，又迷胡胡地做起夢來了。</p>
<p>一個偉丈夫向他走來，作自我介紹：『我是東海龍王，因慕先生奇才，特來拜訪。』</p>
<p>『不敢當。』艾子拜後說：『有什麽垂詢？』</p>
<p>『我想招一個女婿……』</p>
<p>『這事凡人有點……』艾子搶白。</p>
<p>『不是的呀！』龍王急辯：『我們同凡人不通婚的：我的意思是，我選不到一個適當的水族來做我的女婿，請先生貢獻點意見。』</p>
<p>『喔！』艾子放下心，接着說。『先問條件。』</p>
<p>『他做我的女婿，無條件地；我則給他珍珠，珊瑚，以及別的無數海中奇寳，此外，我還給他一塊采邑，請他做我的諸侯，享享福。』</p>
<p>『那麼王的脾氣怎梂？』艾子又問。</p>
<p>『這就是問題的中心。我的脾氣太大，我的女兒也這樣，所以我不願招龍做駙馬，免得大家意氣用事。』</p>
<p>『王怕也善疑的吧？』</p>
<p>『艾先生眞是說到我的心裏。』龍王笑着說。</p>
<p>『這樣，』艾子搓搓手心說：『依凡人看來，只有蝦有入幕的資格。』</p>
<p>『蝦有錄選的資格？』龍王懷疑極了。</p>
<p>『請不要看輕蝦兒，他有三德哩：第一，他沒有心肺，毫無二致：第二，他沒有血液，可以供王責罰：第三，他頭上生滿泥汚，可以卑歉，即使叫他鑽到糞裏去做投機家也不妨。』</p>
<p>『好的，好的！』龍王滿意而歸。</p>
<p>艾子的夢完了，我的『新解』也完了，蝦兒却在做夢做不完哩。</p>

<p>— 葉玫珍譯</p>
<p>這裏又有一個例子：林肯的繼母也僅僅是一個家庭婦女。終日忙於日常瑣事。但是她却敎導和激勵丈夫的兒子。因此林肯藉了她賜的火把解放了黑奴。林肯曾在一封信中寫過：「你問我什麽是曾贖過的最偉大的書？我吿訴你，那就是我繼母！」、她祗是一個家庭婦女。但是却能使丈夫以上帝和世人的愛深入心坎。因此成爲當時最偉大的傳佈福音者。</p>
<p>我們並非認爲世界大業必定由單獨一人開創。但愛默生說：「一件大業祇是一個人展開的影子。」他曾又說：「無所謂偉大的渺小。別人較我偉大，是因爲他曾燃起神聖的火花；而我却沒有。爲了我們輕視自己，並且未曾認淸所處地位的力量，所以我們一無所成。」耶穌說：「假如你能有芥子大的一點信心，那麼你無事不成了！」</p>
<p>我們深信一件簡單的事實；就是人生必有　目的。神聖能力的種子是要我們栽培放苞。這方法很明顯。我們的責任是不遺餘力的努力。一個沒信心的靑年他會說：「我不値什麽。」但是有正確觀念的靑年，必會說「我是無價的！」並目努力去證實這句話。</p>
<p>拿破崙有句至理之言：「環境？我能創造環境。」這並非是一個自大者纔會說的話。這是事實。我們每人都能創造環境！</p>

<p>人生是一種看法，它透過了你偏見的眼睛變紅變綠，或喜或悲。所以智者說，每個人各自創造自己的人生。實在頗有道理。</p>
<p>你可以使自己的人生有價値，有意義。所以沒有人祇念念不忘過去，說過去的歲月好於今朝。你生活於現在的一瞬，你要抓住的也僅是現在的一瞬，只是你可以，而且必須，爭取將來的一瞬。過去不過一種無可奈何的存在，而現在一瞬的損失，却可以預言有一種新的力量從未來駛流到過去。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The 70th Anniversary of This Newspaper <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Today is the 70th anniversary of this newspaper. As we take up our pens to write this commemorative piece, a thousand thoughts and tangled emotions stir within us, and we know not where to begin. Recalling this day seventy years ago, when the inaugural issue of this newspaper met the world, and comparing it to today, when this newspaper continues to diligently work in its role amidst a great era, what progress has the world made in these seventy years—this span of nearly a century? What progress has China made? We can summarize it in one sentence: these seventy years have been a great and turbulent era of human evolution—although, from the perspective of historians, this is but a very short span of time.</p>
<p>This newspaper has grown up in this great era. Today, to recount all the major events of the past seventy years, one by one, and present them in a systematic manner, is absolutely impossible due to the limitations of facts and human resources. Furthermore, this arduous task of organization and combing through awaits the pens of future experts. If we were to describe all the past deeds of this newspaper in detail, we would find it somewhat tedious, because a newspaper is a reflection of its time, progressing together with the era. Rather than saying it is the progress of the newspaper, it is better to say it is the progress of the era that is becoming increasingly apparent. The process of a newspaper's progress seems to require no further elaboration. So, what shall we say? Let us simply state our current views. As for what meaningful commemorations should be made for this 70th anniversary, we will carefully plan and prepare for them in the future.</p>
<p>All of us at this newspaper deeply recognize that a newspaper is a public instrument of society. On one hand, guiding public opinion is the inherent duty of a newspaper, but at the same time, a newspaper should also be guided by public opinion. The direct audience of a newspaper is its millions of readers, and the needs of readers for newspapers and the needs of newspapers for readers are reciprocal. What kind of feeling readers have towards a newspaper before they develop trust in it depends on the accuracy and fairness of the newspaper's usual reporting and arguments. Accuracy and fairness are not easily achieved; they must be cultivated through years of refinement and the resonance of countless readers. Therefore, a subtle connection exists spiritually between the newspaper and its readers, like a shadow following a form, mutually echoing each other. Readers must first have their own confidence before they can place their confidence in the newspaper—in other words, readers must also first possess accurate concepts and fair attitudes. From this, we can also understand that the power of a newspaper is the power of society. Therefore, it is said that a newspaper can indeed guide public opinion, but it will also be guided by public opinion at the same time.</p>
<p>Due to the changes in the times, the reporting of newspapers is sometimes even more expected by the world. Looking back at the hardships this newspaper has gone through in the past seventy years, it is difficult to describe them fully. Future generations will view the present as we view the past. What we can pledge to ourselves is that our colleagues dedicate themselves to the news industry with unwavering loyalty. All the hardships experienced in the past will be a source of encouragement and lessons for our future service.</p>
<p>In recent years, society's expectations for newspapers have become even more urgent than in the past, and the contributions newspapers can make to society are also greater than before. If we cannot achieve distant and grand goals in one fell swoop, we may as well start with near and small ones first. The colleagues of this newspaper, aware of our own inadequacies, have in recent years attempted some small services in response to the needs of the times. From the very beginning, we have also adhered to a purpose, hoping to engage in more active promotion rather than negative advocacy. Knowing that what we can do at this time is limited to this, as the saying goes: "Correct its righteousness without seeking its profit, understand its way without counting its merit." The service of our colleagues is to do our best in our respective duties within the scope allowed by the facts.</p>
<p>Our colleagues take working at the newspaper as a lifelong career. The employees in the office have accumulated long years of service, diligently working day and night. The predecessors who worked at this newspaper were like this, and those who are serving here today are no different. This newspaper has a traditional concept, that is, our colleagues believe that working at a newspaper is a sacred cause, and each should have a sense of faith, as sincere as a missionary's devotion to religion. Secondly, one should have self-respect, for only by respecting oneself will others respect you. With the establishment of faith and self-respect, one can then feel great interest in their work and persistently pursue it as a lifelong career. Some say that in these past few years, our colleagues have experienced many hardships and the newspaper has suffered no small number of setbacks. However, these cannot be considered setbacks; they are a kind of tempering. Any valuable undertaking must undergo countless trials and tribulations to achieve bright and great success. Only in this way can it inspire the courage and perseverance of those engaged in the work and demonstrate a determination to never give up, so that the undertaking will be further developed and expanded. Therefore, the past tempering is a kind of test for us and also establishes a great foundation for future revival.</p>
<p>When this newspaper held its 50th anniversary in the 11th year of the Republic of China (1922), it published "The Most Recent Fifty Years." In the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928), when the 20,000th issue was published, a commemorative booklet was also released. In the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), on its 60th birthday, a summary of the general situation was again compiled and printed as a special booklet. Now, as we gather all the commemorative books and booklets on our desks and read them one by one, we truly have indescribable emotions in our hearts. For example, in the 20,000th issue commemorative booklet, there was a passage that said: "Many people in the editorial department have personally produced issues since the 10,000th issue, and they deeply know that each issue contains the blood of their hearts within it. Whether it is a merit or a crime, accumulating these 20,000 issues is not easy." Now, it has been more than ten years since the 20,000th issue commemoration. The changes in the world and the vicissitudes of life fill us, who continue the work, with infinite emotion. We remember the perseverance of our predecessors in running this newspaper and their extraordinary spirit in maintaining the undertaking amidst difficulties and hardships. We should be even more motivated and make progress, stepping on the established track, taking big strides, and moving forward. This is what we, the colleagues commemorating the 70th anniversary today, use to encourage ourselves and to seek guidance from the readers who care for this newspaper.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "It is rare for a person to live to seventy since ancient times." Today, this newspaper happily celebrates its 70th anniversary but can only let it pass plainly, inevitably with a sense of "seventy years spent in vain." However, we believe that the more ordinary it is, the more profound its meaning. The life of an undertaking and the life of an individual cannot be compared. Human life values seventy years, but for a great undertaking, perhaps seventy years is only the beginning. The life of a newspaper is cumulative and continuous. This newspaper meets its readers every day, as intimately as family members. We wish to work tirelessly with our readers in the torrent of the times, progressing together to promote the brightness and well-being of the world's humanity. This is the sincere hope for commemorating the 70th anniversary of this newspaper.</p>

<p>Manila, 29th (Domei News Agency) - The Philippine Japanese Army Headquarters announced this afternoon at 4:00 PM that after 4:00 AM this morning, Japanese troops landed near Cotabato on the island of Mindanao. Japanese troops are advancing rapidly.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Haitong Agency) - A staff officer of the Japanese General Headquarters stated to the press yesterday afternoon details of the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies. It is claimed that Japan's concern is not only the oil fields in the area, but also to assist the indigenous people in breaking free from 300 years of Dutch rule. The first move of the Japanese army was to occupy important air force bases. After Japanese troops landed in northern Java, Japanese warships entered the Java Sea on February 27.</p>
<p>Canberra, 29th (Reuters) - Today, Australian Prime Minister Curtin made a war statement to Parliament, stating that the Australian government considers the attack on Australia an imminent threat that has not been eliminated. Curtin also announced the establishment of a "Prime Minister's War Council Committee," including Curtin himself, the Commander-in-Chief, and other important ministers and officials deemed able to participate in discussions on military strategy.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 29th (Haitong Agency) - Washington officials announced yesterday that the salaries of American troops stationed in Australia have been increased by 20 percent.</p>
<p>Washington, 29th (Havas Agency) - Reports from Britain that 2,400 U.S. Navy personnel have died, 2,300 are missing, and 1,000 have been injured since the U.S. entered the war have been confirmed here.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Eastern Front Situation <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 28th (Havas Agency) - Military sources here recently analyzed the Eastern Front situation as follows: The situation on the southern front has weakened, but there are still minor skirmishes near Kharkov. There is fierce fighting in the Kursk region. The Red Army continues to advance towards Fatezh, a town northwest of the city that connects to the Orel highway. They have already reached a certain village. The Red Army apparently intends to repel the German forces in Bryansk in order to attack the rear of the Kursk fortress. The Red Army has also established three "bridgeheads" on the Seim River, seemingly intending to attack Kursk from both the north and south. In the Belgorod region, two battalions of the Red Army attacked the German positions in Levkov, without success. The German positions there are extremely well fortified. In the Taganrog region, the Red Army continues to concentrate motorized units, but is only digging trenches in the rear, seemingly adopting a defensive posture without any sign of an offensive. On the Kerch Peninsula, there has been no activity from the German forces in the past 48 hours, but the Red Army launched an artillery barrage yesterday. In addition, the German air force is still actively operating. It is expected that new types of aircraft will also participate in the offensive when it begins. Currently, German aircraft are focusing on bombing railway stations and trains heading to the front lines. At the same time, the Red Army is also stepping up preparations, with heavy railway transport. It is reported that a large number of vehicles have been concentrated on the coast of the Sea of Azov, but the strength of the Soviet southern air force does not seem to have increased.</p>
<p>German War Report</p>
<p>Fuehrer Headquarters, 29th (Haitong Agency) - This afternoon's German war report stated that port facilities and Soviet ships in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov encountered severe air raids. In the central region of Eastern Europe, enemy forces launched several attacks on our positions without success. German forces in the northern region repeatedly launched surprise attacks and achieved victories. Our forces captured a strategically important enemy fortress, killing 1,400 enemy soldiers and destroying 6 tanks, 9 artillery pieces, and countless other military equipment. In the north, German fighter groups engaged enemy aircraft, including American planes, and shot down 15 enemy aircraft, including 14 Hurricane aircraft.</p>

<p>Baghdad, 28th (Reuters) - The Iraqi Department of Archaeology, during excavations in Wasit, discovered a toy shop from 600 years ago, containing hundreds of small figurines and cavalry holding small shields, similar to the small soldiers of today's children's toys.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Details of British Military Exercise Accident Officially Announced by Sinclair <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>London, 29th (Havas Agency) - Air Minister Sinclair recently announced in the House of Commons that an accident occurred during a military exercise in the Salisbury Plain countryside the other day. The casualties included 25 army officers, including one brigadier, and 68 injured, including army officers, 3 air force officers, and many soldiers. The cause of the tragedy was that the Air Force Commander intended to practice fighter aircraft attacking army units in front of the army officers. The target of the aircraft attack was a mock convoy of transport and tanks arranged in three rows. After five Hurricane aircraft attacked this target, the sixth airman mistakenly identified the officers and soldiers watching the exercise as the disguised target and attacked them, leading to the tragedy.</p>

<h3 id="e13">Debate in British House of Commons on Cripps' Mission to India Concluded <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Amery Declares British Goals Unchanged</p>
<p>London, 29th (Reuters) - The House of Commons discussed the mission of Lord Privy Seal Cripps to India yesterday. Secretary of State for India and Burma Amery delivered a speech to conclude the debate, stating that the main purpose of Sir Stafford Cripps' visit to India was to prove the British government's sincerity in resolving the Indian problem. The suggestions he put forward were intended to dispel India's suspicions of Britain. Our ideal is indeed to hope to establish a united Indian federation, but we would rather see it divided and enjoying freedom than to maintain its parts and have them constantly fighting against our country and against themselves. Leaders of all Indian political parties must understand that resolving difficulties is an inseparable responsibility of themselves, not our responsibility. If they understand this, then the right method and the right spirit can arise. Sir Stafford Cripps' mission can be said to have failed in a narrow sense, but in a broad sense, it cannot be said to have been in vain. The proposal of the former Premier of Madras to the Indian National Congress was a promising initiative. If it were not for Sir Stafford Cripps' visit, we would not have seen the hope of such a proposal. Although our proposal has been announced as withdrawn, its goal has not changed.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 29th (Haitong Agency) - Cripps delivered a speech in the House of Commons on the failure of his trip to India, and the House immediately discussed the issue. Most members agreed to continue efforts to reach an understanding with India. Some Conservative members even believed that Cripps' trip had achieved considerable results. Labour MP Cuff raised the question of why military power in India could not be handed over to the Indians. He charged that the responsibility for this should be placed on the shoulders of the Indian people and their representatives. During the discussion, Amery said that Cripps' main purpose was to resolve doubts about the sincerity of the British government. Although this trip has failed, its failure is only superficial. He repeatedly condemned the division of Indian leaders and said that Cripps had traveled to India with great difficulty to seek understanding, but the Indian leaders did not move at all. Amery concluded by saying that the British government still considers India to be a supporter of Britain in this war. If the Indian National Congress is willing to share the responsibility of continuing the war in the interim government, the War Cabinet is willing to give part of its power to the party.</p>

<p>According to reports from the previous day, Japanese naval forces began their offensive on the Molucca Islands and the northern part of western New Guinea on March 31. By April 19, they had completely occupied all key points in the area. The Molucca Islands, also known as the Spice Islands, once attracted famous explorers, and the profits from the spice trade were used to build noble buildings in Venice, Lisbon, and Bruges, before fading into obscurity. However, the current wealth of the Molucca Islands is not spices, but tin, rubber, and oil. Islands such as Halmahera, Boeroe, and Ceram are large, but not historically famous. In contrast, the islands of Ternate and Banda Naira are famous for their cloves and nutmeg, and Ambon is also well-known, serving as a Dutch East Indies outer naval and air force base.

<p>Western Newspaper Comments on the French Political Situation</p>
<p>Madrid, 28th (Havas) – "Weekly Outlook" commented on the French political situation, stating that the French colonial empire can still be loyal to the motherland after France's defeat, which shows the greatness of Marshal Pétain. As for General de Gaulle, although he advocates resistance, the French colonies do not follow him, so his plan has completely failed. Although the colonies are easily influenced by Britain, they are still willing to belong to the defeated motherland, which is all due to their loyalty to Marshal Pétain. Pétain himself has unwavering confidence in his mission, so this loyalty will not change. Therefore, Pétain's attitude can completely change the attitude of the French colonial empire in a matter of hours. It is commendable that the head of a defeated country can still have such great power and responsibility.</p>

<p>Swiss Capital, 28th (Havas) – French General Giraud, former commander of the Eighth Army, was captured by German troops in northern France last year and imprisoned in the Königstein Fortress. Recently, he suddenly escaped without a trace. It is now known that General Giraud, under an assumed name, arrived in Switzerland on the 21st of this month. He immediately contacted the federal authorities and proved his identity. In accordance with international law, he was allowed to continue his journey. He left again on the 25th. The German authorities have issued an arrest warrant, offering a reward of 100,000 marks to anyone who provides information leading to his capture.</p>

<h3 id="e38">The Northwest Frontier of India (II) <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>If the frontier is further divided, it is generally based on the areas along the river basins, such as the Kurram, Tochi, Gomal, and Zhob, which are named after the rivers that flow through these areas.</p>
<p>It is also possible to divide it based on the inhabitants. For example, the Afridi area, inhabited by the Kakae and other tribes, the Turi area centered on the fertile Kurram River basin, and the Waziristan area inhabited by the Waziri and Mahsud tribes. Balochistan, including the Zhob area, is inhabited by the Pashtun and Baloch people, and the name Balochistan is derived from this.</p>
<p>In terms of category, these people all belong to the same lineage. Their appearance, language, and customs are very similar to those of the inhabitants of Afghanistan. However, Afghanistan has a more stable government and rulers with strong tactics. For a long time, this has made the Afghans more law-abiding and orderly than the tribal peoples on the Northwest Frontier outside the administrative boundary.</p>
<p>The tribal areas are notoriously poor and have nothing for invaders to plunder. They did not stay in this area, but went south into prosperous India. Moreover, the tribal areas are difficult to attack, and ancient kings regarded war as a business, seeking only to plunder and occupy large tracts of land for rule.</p>
<p>Therefore, these tribes have always been undisturbed: for example, the Macedonian Greeks described the Satagrae and Apaliretae people of India. From their names and descriptions, it is not difficult to identify these as the nations that call themselves the Khatak and Afridi people today. The period of the Macedonian invasion of India is relatively recent, only a thousand years ago, but the Satagrae and Apaliretae people may have been scattered there for a long time before they were discovered by the Macedonians.</p>
<p>The tribal areas are mountainous and barren, instantly reminding one of the highlands of Scotland, knowing that the Pashtuns there must be brave and good at robbing livestock and looting homes. This is indeed the hereditary profession of the Pashtuns. In their minds, they only know how to plunder, and everything else is not important. However, today, they also understand that this Robin Hood business is not as lucrative as it used to be, so some Pashtuns have learned to drive cars or go to sea to make a living by boat; others have joined the Indian Army, served as soldiers for a while, but then become homesick and reluctant to leave their homeland's towering mountains, so they retire and return to the mountains.</p>
<p>Because the tribal areas have been isolated from the outside world for a long time, the Pashtuns have special characteristics. They never recognize rulers, and even disregard their own tribal chiefs. Pashtun men are only interested in killing members of their own family, regarding the vendetta as a glorious thing. The origin of this internal strife cannot be traced back to ancient times. From this, it can be seen that every Pashtun man is armed, and this kind of life will inevitably lead to the result of valuing oneself and distrusting others.</p>
<p>Below the foothills is a plain, extending to the Indus River. This part belongs to mainland India, but the administration is slightly different: because the disordered mountains on the edge of the plain are inhabited by tribal peoples, this is unavoidable. Police officers in the Northwest Frontier Province and Balochistan are equipped with rifles, and the more important and easily attacked villages are equipped with rifles so that they can be distributed to the strong men in the village to fight back when Pashtuns raid. The Pashtuns in the stable areas are still very similar to their kinsmen in the tribal mountains, but they have become accustomed to being ruled for a long time. The custom of clan vendettas is forbidden by English law and has tended to disappear; most importantly, they have developed a character of trusting others and are very capable as policemen and soldiers.</p>
<p>Travelers to India may land in Mumbai, and what they see of India is somewhat similar to what they imagine - a hot tropical land, full of palm trees and dark-skinned, scantily clad Indians, foreign plants and animals on a haphazard plain, ancient temples, palaces and fortresses, and the roaring of tigers, all of which remind travelers of the Indian scenery described in storybooks. However, what you see in the northwest is definitely not the India you expect. If it is winter, the climate is cold, the mountain tops are covered with snow, the plains freeze at night, and the cold air pierces the skin in the morning and evening.</p>
<p>The people you often meet there are not dark-skinned, but white like Europeans, wearing sheepskin coats, tall, with blue, green, and gray eyes, and reddish-brown hair, lively and alert, more cheerful and smiling than the people elsewhere in India.</p>
<p>Travelers probably value their lives, but if not, the government cares about the lives of travelers and does not allow them to roam freely in the tribal areas. However, travelers can still travel along the tribal areas and even within those areas, comfortably and safely, studying ethnic forms and watching caravans enter India from Afghanistan. These caravans carry blankets on tall camels, trading with India. Travelers can also witness the annual migration of the Powindahs, who are an Afghan tribe that migrates to northern India every time the weather turns cold, leading their families, men, women, old and young. Camels carry packages of goods and furniture, and children with rosy cheeks and small camels and puppies are also carried on the camels' backs. The caravans and flocks of sheep are guarded by tall, fierce dogs as they advance.</p>

<h3 id="e39">The Detention at Dinghai Has Lasted Over a Year: The Moufu Steamer Returned to Shanghai Yesterday, Will Enter the Dock for Repairs and Prepare for Resumption of Sailing; Change of Ownership for the Haifu and Negotiation on Shipping Routes are Still Underway <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>The Moufu steamer of the German Lihé Yanghang Shipping Department was seized by the Japanese Navy in the winter of the year before last while sailing to Wenzhou in the Zhejiang waters and taken to Dinghai for detention. It has been detained for nearly a year and a half. It was previously reported that a certain prominent figure had been appointed to negotiate and had obtained permission from the Japanese Navy. It was released in the middle of this month, and the steamer discharged its cargo of grain in Dinghai. After unloading was completed the day before yesterday, it</p>
<p>raised anchor and came to Shanghai.</p>
<p>It entered the Wusongkou at 6:50 AM yesterday and sailed directly to the South Huangpu River. At around 9:00 AM, it passed the Bund Customs and sailed south. Then, it sailed north again from the South Huangpu River and anchored at buoy numbers 22 and 23 in Yangshupu. The steamer was originally the Xin Ningshao of the Ningshao Company's Shanghai-Ningbo line. After the August 13th Incident, it changed to the German flag and continued to operate the Ningbo route. After Ningbo fell, it changed to sail to Wenzhou. Because the Japanese Navy prohibited sailing to the ports of Zhejiang and Fujian, the steamer was detained in Dinghai for violating the Japanese Navy's prohibition order. Now, through the</p>
<p>negotiations and release</p>
<p>to Shanghai of a certain prominent figure, another company will be formed, intending to resume sailing to eastern Zhejiang. However, due to being out of service for a long time, the ship's hull is inevitably damaged and will be docked for repairs within days. The sailing schedule will be determined after the repairs are completed. Furthermore, the Haifu steamer has been purchased by the Yamashita Company, and a company is being organized by a Mr. Xu and others to change the flag. It is said that the change of the ship's name is ready. Regarding the commencement of navigation, because the procedures such as the shipping routes are still in progress, the date of commencement of navigation is not yet determined.</p>
<h3 id="e40">French Tram and Bus Fares to Increase Starting Tomorrow <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>The French tram company has decided to increase fares starting tomorrow. According to continuing inquiries from the Datong News Agency reporter, fares will increase more for first-class than for third-class. First-class fares will increase by a maximum of 15 cents, while third-class fares will increase by a maximum of only 5 cents. For example, the number 2 tram line (Xujiahui to the Sixteen Shops) will have a minimum fare of 10 cents and a maximum fare of 35 cents for third class, and a minimum fare of 25 cents and a maximum fare of 60 cents for first class. The number 10 tram line (Lujiazui to the Sixteen Shops) will have a minimum fare of 10 cents and a maximum fare of 35 cents for third class, and a minimum fare of 25 cents and a maximum fare of 55 cents for first class. The number 17 trolleybus line (Great World to Dapu Bridge) will have a minimum fare of 10 cents and a maximum fare of 30 cents for third class, and a minimum fare of 25 cents and a maximum fare of 55 cents for first class. The number 24 tram line (West Gate to Avenue Foch) will have a minimum fare of 10 cents and a maximum fare of 30 cents for third class, and a minimum fare of 25 cents and a maximum fare of 55 cents for first class. As for the number 22 bus line, the minimum fare will be 25 cents and the maximum fare will be 60 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Last Day for Issuing Subletting Licenses <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>The issuance of subletting licenses by the Public Works Department ended on Tuesday (the day before yesterday). The total number of licenses issued was 21,230. Compared with the more than 60,000 application forms requested by second landlords, there must be many who have not received licenses. The deadline for receiving licenses is only today. According to reporters, what steps the Public Works Department will take against second landlords who have not obtained licenses is highly noteworthy. It is generally believed that the Public Works Department will inevitably take the following two paths: 1. Consider extending the deadline for obtaining licenses; 2. Directly punish second landlords who have not obtained licenses. However, as of yesterday, the Public Works Department and the subletting license management office had not made any statements. The number of licenses issued on the 27th and 28th is recorded below: On the 27th, 444 licenses were issued in the Central District, 848 in the Western District, 436 in the Northern District, and 463 in the Eastern District, totaling 2,191. On the 28th, 64 licenses were issued in the Central District, 906 in the Western District, 453 in the Northern District, and 514 in the Eastern District, totaling 2,237.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Hubei Natives Depart for Hankou Today: All Enjoy Half-Price Tickets for Boarding, Re-entry Permits are Still Being Processed as Usual <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The Public Works Department continues to process re-entry permits starting from the first of next month. Hometown associations and other social organizations entrusted to do so will also continue to issue re-entry permits as usual, but half-price tickets will no longer be issued starting from the first of next month. However, if the number of people is over 200 and they are returning to the same destination, they can still apply for half-price train or boat tickets. From this, it can be seen that the authorities in the two concessions are continuing their efforts to evacuate the population of Shanghai. The Hubei Native Association in Shanghai, entrusted by the Chinese Evacuation Association, registered a group of fellow villagers. All 200 registered people obtained half-price boat tickets from the association the day before yesterday and boarded the ship yesterday afternoon. The ship is scheduled to set sail from Shanghai to Hankou today.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Rice Shops in Both Concessions Sell Rice Yesterday: Five Warehouses Release Rice, Rice Shops Extend Rice Selling Hours, Corn will be Picked Up Today and Sold Tomorrow <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Rice shops in both concessions sold foreign rice yesterday, which was quite common. Especially in the French Concession, because the number of bags had been increased, the selling hours were extended accordingly, starting from 8:00 AM and ending at 6:00 PM. Although there were many people buying rice, those who were numbered could buy foreign rice. The quantity limit was still one Sheng per person. The corn released by the rice shops in both concessions from Lihé Warehouse, No. 195 Suzhou Road, can be picked up today. Tomorrow, 372 rice shops can sell it universally. The quantity of corn received by the rice shops will remain the same. The Public Works Department's Rice Office continued to designate yesterday the Taikoo Warehouse, Huishan Wharf Warehouse, Dacheng Warehouse, Huachang Warehouse, and Zhejiang Xingye Warehouse, a total of five locations, for rice shops to pick up starting today. This foreign rice can be picked up on Friday and sold at retail on Saturday. The above warehouses release foreign rice and Wuhu rice. Foreign glutinous rice has been sold out.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Cease Collecting Damaged Small Denomination Notes: Encourage Circulation to Alleviate Small Currency Panic <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>The Bank Joint Reserve Committee, in order to regulate finance and stabilize the market, has collected about 20 million yuan in old and damaged banknotes from various banks and firms. It has decided to continue collecting them in the future, but hopes that all sectors will not be overly picky about slightly damaged banknotes in order to promote circulation. Recently, in view of the severe shortage of one-yuan notes in the market, which has caused great inconvenience to merchants and residents, in addition to ordering all banks and firms to release and circulate as much of their one-yuan note reserves as possible, it has also submitted a request to the Silver and Money Industry Temporary Joint Association for approval to temporarily cease the collection of damaged one-yuan notes starting tomorrow. A notice has been issued to all banks and firms to accept one-yuan notes that are not severely damaged as much as possible in order to alleviate the small currency panic. In addition, other appropriate measures are being planned, such as increasing the issuance of one-yuan notes by the issuing bank. It is also heard that the relevant authorities believe that the number of one-yuan notes circulating in the market is quite large and there is no reason for such a shortage. It is apparent that someone is deliberately manipulating for profit, and they have already started investigating and taking measures to crack down.</p>

<p>Colleagues Hold a Tea Party to Encourage Each Other</p>
<p>Today is the 70th anniversary of this newspaper. The colleagues, considering the difficult times, did not want to make a big deal of it. Therefore, no announcements were made beforehand. However, in consideration of the difficulty of the past founding and the importance of future responsibilities, in order to create a spiritual commemoration, a tea party was held today by the staff of various departments in the newspaper to encourage each other. As for how to make a meaningful commemoration, it is being solemnly planned and will be announced in the future. The brief history of this newspaper is described as follows:</p>
<p>Brief History of This Newspaper</p>
<p>The Shenbao was born 39 years before the founding of the Republic of China, that is, in the 11th year of Tongzhi, Ren Shen (1872 AD), which is 70 years ago. It was initially founded by a Mr. Maizé, who only published a paper every other day. It was simple and crude. After four months, it published a paper every day, and the paper's format became more advanced than before. When the Vietnam War broke out, the Chinese people relied on the Shenbao to learn about the news, and this newspaper was the first to use telegraphs to report the truth, which was convenient for readers. When the war ended, the reputation of the Shenbao was thus well-known. Later, Mr. Maizé returned to his country due to old age. Before leaving, he reorganized the Shenbao into a company, with Mr. Xi Zimei as the Chinese manager. After five years, in Bing Wu, the Chinese became the owners of the newspaper. At that time, Mr. Xi Zimei had already passed away, and his disciple Zi Pei succeeded him, with full authority. During the Xinhai Revolution, the attention of the whole country was focused on public opinion, especially the Shenbao. In the first year of the Republic of China, Mr. Shi Liangcai, the general manager of this newspaper, took over and has been in charge ever since. For 70 years, we have been honored to have the love and care of readers and the supervision and instruction of society, which has enabled us to promote and develop. The colleagues of this newspaper are committed to inheriting the spirit of the past 70 years in order to expand the infinite future.</p>
<p>The Current Premises of This Newspaper</p>
<p>The old premises of this newspaper were originally on Hankou Road (east of Henan Road), opposite Holy Trinity Church (commonly known as the Red Church), which is now part of the Public Works Department's site. Our humble premises, with three thatched roofs, were not the foundation of today's towering buildings, but "in a small room, with dim lights all night, two or three colleagues wrote together." There was a plaque in the editorial office with the words "Zunwen Pavilion" written by Wu Jing (Ju Tan) from Qiantang in September 1882 (Autumn of Ren Wu in the Qing Guangxu era). The Zunwen Pavilion plaque is still preserved in this museum. The picture on the right shows the old premises of this museum on Wangping Street.</p>

<p>Lu Yongsheng, a 34-year-old Suzhou native residing at No. 201 Julai Road, was privately forging permits for various places in the interior and selling them for profit. At around 5:00 AM yesterday, detectives from the French General Patrol Station rushed to the address and arrested Lu Yongsheng. More than 20 forged permits and all the seals used for manufacturing were found in his room and taken back to the police station.</p>

<p>Last month, a person named Shu Changbin remitted 30,000 yuan in national currency from Datai to the Shanghai Bank, stating that the money should be transferred by Han Jiahe, a staff member of the Ningbo branch of the Siming Bank in Ningbo, to Fu Anhua. However, Han privately carved Fu Anhua's seal and withdrew the money from the Shanghai Bank. He then used the money to engage in speculative ventures, losing all of it. Recently, Shu and Fu met in Shanghai and talked about the money. Fu said that he had not received it and negotiated with Han, but to no avail. He then reported it to the Central Police Station. Chinese Detective Tang Zihong and Detective Cheng Renkun arrested Han and took him into custody, pending investigation.</p>

<p>Since the supply of rice has become scarce, various grains have appeared on people's tables. In addition to corn, wheat bran, millet, red beans, and soybeans are also used to satisfy hunger. The results of the experiment: many people find it unbearably coarse and difficult to swallow; many people find it has a special flavor and is very sweet. However, in terms of nutritional value, grains are far better than white rice. Therefore, whether you find it difficult to swallow or sweet, once they enter your stomach, they will unknowingly add a layer of steel and concrete to your health fortress. In this way, not being able to eat white rice in a chaotic world is "a blessing in disguise."</p>
<p>Compared with white rice, the main ingredients of corn can be said to be no different. Except that corn has more fat content, other ingredients such as protein, starch, minerals, and fiber are not much different. However, if we compare their vitamin content, there will be significant differences in strengths and weaknesses. Now, let’s list the table below: (per 100 cm)</p>
<p>It can be seen that corn has an absolute advantage in the first three items, which is not an accident, because the essence of white rice is originally in a thin layer of rice skin (bran), which has already been lost after milling. We can also see the richness of vitamins in corn from its color; the yellow of corn, just like the yellow of egg yolks, the yellow of butter, the yellow of soybeans, and the yellow of oranges—are all signs of richness in vitamins. Not only that, but there are also two types of corn, yellow and white, and the white one is far inferior to the yellow one (the values ​​shown in the table above are all yellow corn). This is also like sweet potatoes being better than white potatoes, and carrots being better than white radishes.</p>
<p>The last item in the table above, nicotinic acid, is very low in corn (especially corn flour), but this shortcoming cannot be ignored, because it is also a very important vitamin. A lack of it will cause a disease called "pellagra," which is a disease often suffered by people who eat corn (corn). Last year, there was a Sullivan's "Vitamin B Bread" on the market, which was made with vitamin-enriched flour from the United States. In addition to vitamin B1 (thiamine), it also contained nicotinic acid. (The riboflavin in the table above was formerly known as vitamin B2. Vitamin B may now include more than sixteen nutrients, of which the three mentioned here are the most important.)</p>
<p>Pellagra was formerly known as "Italian leprosy." In the United States, because its symptoms are red inflammations on the skin, it is also known as "red plague." At first, people saw that the disease was very common and often regarded it as a prevalent infectious disease. Later, scientific research revealed that it was caused by malnutrition. Until recently, the truth was completely revealed—the main reason was the lack of nicotinic acid in food. Ten years ago, residents in the Mississippi River basin in the southern United States, due to their relatively hard lives, used corn flour as their main food. Hundreds of thousands of people suffered from this disease, and a total of 70 people died from it every year. Afterwards, the authorities tried to prevent it, but because dietary habits were not easy to change, there were still more than 100,000 patients every year, and it has not been completely eliminated. Pellagra is rarely found in our country, but with years of war and rising prices, ordinary people often suffer from lack of food, and the issue of nutrition is naturally out of the question. Therefore, this disease is very likely to occur; recent reports from hospitals in Shanghai and other places have confirmed the existence of this trend.</p>
<p>The symptoms of pellagra are quite complicated. Generally speaking, there are several of the following:</p>
<p>Red inflammations on the skin, most obvious on the back of the hands, wrists, and lower arms.</p>
<p>Inflammations: stomatitis, scrotitis.</p>
<p>Gastrointestinal disorders: loss of appetite, diarrhea, etc.</p>
<p>Mental disorders: In severe cases, even mental confusion, frenzy, and fainting.</p>
<p>A person who eats corn rice should seek medical treatment or improve their diet if they find that they have a tendency to the above symptoms. If the disease is severe, there is no other way to survive except to use nicotinamide and other drugs for emergency treatment.</p>
<p>To prevent problems before they occur, people who generally eat pure corn rice should pay special attention: they must eat more green vegetables and beans every day, and it is better to eat some meat. If corn is mixed with white rice or beans to cook rice, its nutritional value will be higher than eating corn or white rice alone, because if white rice is eaten alone without getting enough thiamine from other sources, there is a risk of beriberi. In addition, it should be mentioned that generally people think that foreign rice is not as good as "rice," which is not very correct. From the perspective of vitamin content, foreign rice is only better than "rice," although not much better. However, no matter what kind of white rice it is, the trace vitamins it only preserves are contained in the mixed rice flour. If it is washed too thoroughly, it will be completely lost. Similarly, when red beans and soybeans are soaked in cold water for a long time, a large amount of vitamin B is leached out, and this water cannot be discarded. All of this must be paid attention to by those who pay attention to nutrition.</p>

<h3 id="e54">A New Invention in Transportation: The Austin-Style Bicycle, As Light and Comfortable As a Car <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>In recent months, the sources of various fuels have been blocked, and the operation of vehicles has become a problem. The operation of buses and private cars has been suspended one after another, and the running time and number of trams have also been reduced. As a result, bicycles have become popular for a while. General technical experts have studied them, carefully designed them, and various new types of vehicles have been constantly introduced to the market. For example, bicycles are equipped with seats, either on the side or behind the car, and there are even three-wheeled and four-wheeled ones, emerging one after another.</p>
<p>Bicycle Canopy Car</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Fang of China Automobile Company has recently invented a new type of automobile-style bicycle, which is shaped like an Austin small car. The bottom is equipped with four wheels, the chassis is made of lightweight steel bones, and the body is made of high-quality, strong, lightweight lacquered cloth, which is not afraid of wind and rain. Its structure is based on the principle of pedal rickshaws and has been transformed.</p>
<p>Like a Car</p>
<p>The driving method is also no different from that of a car. It is equipped with a steering wheel on top. When the driver turns, he can easily transfer. Anyone can do it. It is even more economical to drive yourself. In addition to the driver, one person can sit side by side in the car. The bottom is equipped with a pedal chain to help the driver pedal, and the car travels faster. The front can accommodate two adults, and the rear compartment can carry two children.</p>
<p>Special Production for Five Years</p>
<p>According to the inventor, Mr. Fang, the company's factory is located on Avenue Road. It has been approved for special production for five years. The first batch of cars has been launched and has received Notice No. 44 from the Public Works Department. Currently, there are many people ordering from the company. In about a month, there may be forty or fifty cars appearing on various roads. Unfortunately, rubber tires are not easy to collect in large quantities, which will become a problem in the future.</p>
<p>Light and Comfortable</p>
<p>The advantages of this car are that it is light, fast, safe, the seats are comfortable, there is no suffering from bumps, and the appearance is beautiful, like a car. The selling price is about 6,000 yuan per car, and the fee paid to the notice is only 150 yuan per half year, which is much cheaper than car donation fees.</p>

<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" reported that a novel judgment was made in court the day before yesterday. The person in question was a Westerner, Caraghilicos Grigorios, the owner of the Vassos Store on Avenue Joffre, who was fined 500 yuan for selling impure olive oil and ordered to post the amount of the fine and the reason for the fine on the shop's window glass, so that passers-by could see it at a glance. It was found that the offender sold oil that actually contained peanut oil as pure olive oil. During the trial, he still quibbled that the oil was bought in 1940 (the year before last) and had not been mixed with anything. However, the Public Works Department's chemical test results proved that it was mixed with a certain amount of peanut oil, so the above judgment was made public.</p>

<p>The National Medicine Exhibition held by the Aurora University Museum has been open for two weeks, and people from all walks of life have shown great interest. The number of visitors has increased in the past week, with groups and schools visiting together. The organizers of the museum have also added public performances of drug experiments and academic lectures by specialists to increase the interest of visitors. Last Friday's pharmacology demonstration used the heart of a revived rabbit to demonstrate the effects of several national medicines. It was held in the physiology classroom of Aurora University, with nearly 200 attendees, including colleagues from the medical and pharmaceutical fields and students from various schools. The experimenters provided explanations during the performance. On Saturday, the Pasteur Institute gave a detailed account of its research on national medicines, and encouraged domestic researchers of national medicines to embrace the spirit of Pasteur. It is reported that the third week (May 2nd) of the conference will feature a lecture by Dr. Wu Yunrui on Saturday on "Humble Opinions on Researching National Medicines." The lecture in the fourth week will be given on Sunday, May 10th, by Dr. Huang Shengbai on "Li Shizhen's Phonology."

<p>Yu Sunshi, a local resident of No. 30, Fuxu Fang, Fuxu Road, in the French Concession, is the wife of the late Shanghai tycoon Yu Baoqing. Her nephew, Xu Longyuan, did not pursue a proper occupation and indulged in vices. He repeatedly asked his aunt, Sunshi, for loans, not just once, and the amounts were not small. Recently, he came up with a new idea. He colluded with ruffians Yu Guisheng, Yu Caibao, and Fan Xifang in an opium den. Using a certain party's name, they falsely accused Yu Sunshi of secretly storing weapons buried under the Fahua Cemetery, claiming that they needed to be investigated. Using this as a pretext, they extorted money from Yu Sunshi. Sunshi had already given them 500 yuan twice, but Xu and the others were still dissatisfied. They then called Yu Sunshi from the Dadong Hotel, demanding 100,000 yuan. Inspector Gui Baoquan, detective Zhou Buguang, and detective Li Shuren of the French Police Department investigated the case and rushed to arrest Xu, the two Yus, and Fan. The details of the case were reported in the newspapers. The case has now been concluded, and the verdict was handed down yesterday. The defendants were found guilty of extortion. Yu Guisheng was sentenced to ten months' imprisonment, Yu Caibao to nine months' imprisonment, and Xu and Fan were each sentenced to four months' imprisonment as a warning.</p>

<h3 id="e65">Preface to "A Historical View of the Book of Changes" (1) <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Pu'an</p>
<p>Interpreting the Book of Changes from a Historical Perspective: A Groundbreaking Idea in Chinese Classical Studies</p>
<p>When Pu'an was thirteen or fourteen years old, he was reading Zhu Xi's "Original Meaning of the Book of Changes" of the Song Dynasty. One day, he asked his tutor: "In the sixth line of the Kun hexagram, it says, 'Dragons fight in the wilderness, their blood is black and yellow.' Ordinary blood is red, so why is dragon blood black and yellow? And what exactly is a dragon?" Someone said, "The dragon fight has been going on for a long time, and the blood has dried, hence the black and yellow color." The tutor could not answer and simply said, "Dragons are mythical creatures, and they do not exist now." Another day, he asked: "The hexagram statement of the Li hexagram says, 'Treading on the tiger's tail, it does not bite the person, good fortune.' But the sixth line says, 'Treading on the tiger's tail, it bites the person, misfortune.' In the same hexagram, why does the tiger sometimes bite and sometimes not bite? What is the reason?" The tutor said, "Not biting the person leads to good fortune, biting the person leads to misfortune." He asked again: "Boy and girl are common terms. The first line of the Guan hexagram says, 'Childlike viewing, the way of the petty person.' The second line says, 'Peeping viewing, the girl is auspicious, but also shameful.' So, viewing a boy is just the way of the petty person, and peeping at a girl is a shameful act. The sacred texts have already said this." The tutor angrily said, "How can the sacred texts say such a thing?" He replied, "Men and women mix essence, and all things are created. Is this not a sacred text? What exactly is essence, and how is it mixed? After mixing, how can it create all things?" The tutor was extremely angry and remained silent, and his anger increased. It happened to be dinner time, and he took a piece of salted meat and ate it. He sighed and said, "The sacred texts are truly untrustworthy." The tutor asked why. He replied, "The fifth and sixth lines of the Shi He hexagram say, 'Biting dried meat, obtaining gold.' If this piece of meat contains gold, wouldn't that be a small fortune?" The tutor said, "You are truly a bookworm," and laughed it off.</p>
<p>From then on, he had a belly full of doubts about the Book of Changes and stopped reading it. Before the age of thirty, he had not seen any book about the Book of Changes except for Zhu Xi's "Original Meaning of the Book of Changes." However, he heard people say that the Book of Changes was a mysterious and unknowable book. After the age of thirty, he began to read Wang Bi's Commentary on the Book of Changes, Kong Yingda's "Correct Meaning," "Collated Interpretations of the Book of Changes," Cheng Yi's "Commentary on the Book of Changes," Li Dingzuo's "Collected Explanations of the Book of Changes," and Li Daoban's "Collected Explanations with Annotations of the Book of Changes." He then vaguely understood that there was a distinction between the Han and Song schools of Yi studies. Wang Bi's Yi studies differed from the Han school, and the Song Confucians did not follow it either, except that Cheng Yi's commentary had some similarities. However, although he had read four or five kinds of Yi, he was still ignorant of the main meaning of Yi. So, he put it aside and did not read it for several years.</p>
<p>In the fifth year of the Republic of China, Hang Xinzai was released from Yuan Shikai's prison, claiming that he had obtained the true teachings of Yi studies in prison. In the seventh and eighth years of the Republic of China, Xinzai gathered members of the National Assembly to lecture on Yi in Guangzhou, and the trend of lecturing on Yi became extremely popular for a time. In Shanghai, there was a Zhouyi Society, and the lectures they compiled attributed everything, from submarines to bombers, to the Book of Changes. In the superstitious era, the Book of Changes was used as a talisman to scare ghosts, but now it is used as a weapon to beat people. Although this kind of strange saying was not seen in Xinzai's book, constitutional monarchy was used as an image of the same person, democratic constitutionalism was used as an image of great possession, the seven colors of sunlight were seen in the image of Ben, and microorganisms changing matter were seen in the image of Gu. Qian's position is in the south, Qian is ice, which means that it was known early on that there was the Arctic Ocean and the division of chemistry, which is in line with the images and numbers. These kinds of sayings are often seen in Xinzai's Yi book.</p>
<p>He has always had a curious heart, and was stimulated by these kinds of strange sayings. So, his father aroused his desire to read Yi, but he gained nothing for a long time. His father then suddenly realized, "Even if there is such a saying, it is just a coincidence. Even if there is a match, it is just a general outline. It can never be read as a science book, and it has no scientific value." But what exactly is the Book of Changes? It is neither a chronicle of the Shangshu, nor a chronicle of the Spring and Autumn Annals, neither a poem in words, nor a rite in systems. In the end, he had to treat it as a book of divination. The Book of Changes' divination is seen a lot in the Zuo Zhuan, but unfortunately, there is no way to verify the ancient divination methods. So, he took several kinds of Yi from the "Corrected and Continued Qing Classics Explanations" and read them, thinking that he would be able to find some ancient methods in the books of Yi scholars of the Han Dynasty. If he didn't read it, he wouldn't. But when he read it, the sayings of hexagram qi, messages, bigrams, Na Jia, Shiying, Feifu, noble and base, Zhenhui, and Meng qi became confusing for a while.</p>
<p>At that time, he was teaching at National University. Students asked to open a course on the Book of Changes, which was still popular at that time. If he used Hang Xinzai's book as a textbook, and then embellished it with strange explanations, it would be enough to cater to the tastes of ordinary students. He secretly disagreed with this. So, he compiled a lecture note on the Book of Changes, consisting of twenty-three chapters: Introduction, Naming, Explanation of Doubts, On Hexagrams, On [missing word], On Images, Ten Wings, On Interlocking Bodies, On Changed Hexagrams, On Proportion, [missing word] Chart, [missing word] Reading Yi, Schools of Yi Studies in the Two Han Dynasties, Schools of Yi Studies in the Three Kingdoms, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties, Sui and Tang Dynasties, Schools of Yi Studies in the Song, Yuan, and Ming Dynasties, Schools of Yi Studies in the Qing Dynasty, Philology of the Book of Changes, Rhetoric of the Book of Changes, Philosophy of the Book of Changes, Ritual Education of the Book of Changes, [missing word] History and Geography of the Book of Changes, [missing word] Art of the Book of Changes, [missing word] Bibliography for Studying the Book of Changes. He compiled this lecture note without adopting strange sayings, nor adding his own opinions, so that after students read this lecture note, they could recognize the Book of Changes based on their own academic abilities. Except for the introduction chapter, from naming to the nine chapters on proportion, are the important parts of the Book of Changes, taking the sayings of various schools and compiling them, so that scholars can know the general outline of the Book of Changes. The chapter on charts is based on the sayings of Hu Wei and Wan Sitong, that the Hetu, Luoshu, Prior Heaven, Posterior Heaven, sixty [missing word] hexagrams, square and round charts are the learning of Shao Kangjie, not Yi learning. From the reading method of Yi to the five chapters on the schools of Yi studies in the Qing Dynasty, readers can roughly understand the changes in Yi studies. The six chapters from the philology of the Book of Changes to the art of the Book of Changes are the methods he used to organize old Chinese books. Whether it is the Book of Documents, the Book of Poetry, the Three Rites, or the Spring and Autumn Annals, all are organized using this method. Unfortunately, only the Yi Jing studies and the Book of Poetry studies have been done. The other three books, the Book of Documents, the Three Rites, and the Spring and Autumn Annals, can only be expected of future generations. The last chapter is an appendix to the bibliography on the study of the Book of Changes. But this kind of plan was a failure. Most students like novel sayings. His lecture note had neither novel sayings nor could it say what kind of book the Book of Changes was. After learning it, what was the use? Students often asked him, and he really had no words to answer. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e71">National Debt Plummets Through Four Barriers: Type B Drops 14 Yuan Lower Than Type A, An Unprecedented Occurrence Since the Issuance of Unified National Bonds <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>The over-the-counter market for national bonds continued to decline yesterday. Trading was relatively stable at the beginning because the drop the day before was already significant, and many people had short positions to cover. Therefore, Type C opened at 61 yuan and hovered for a long time. Later, it recovered slightly. When Type C reached 0.45 yuan, selling began to emerge, increasing as it went, and the 60 yuan mark was broken. Type E initially traded at 7.70 yuan and hovered at 7 yuan for a long time. After breaking 7 yuan, it went downhill, breaking into 6 yuan, 5 yuan, and then 4 yuan. It broke through four barriers in one day, with the price plummeting by as much as 4 yuan. This can be described as a rare catastrophe in the bond market. This further proves that the outflow of this kind of physical goods cannot be underestimated. Long positions will inevitably retreat. It is estimated that the selling has been going on for two or three weeks, totaling more than 20 million yuan. The remaining strength is unknown, but it is enough to prove the enthusiasm of buyers. The sale of 20 million yuan worth of goods has a definite power to digest in this market, and cannot be taken lightly. Yesterday, Tongli was still the leading seller, constantly releasing spot goods, causing the market price to drop in a straight line without looking back. Type E suffered the most severe drop, with a single transaction falling by 4 yuan. The closing price was 5 or 6 yuan lower than Type C, which was already unusual, and even 0.6 yuan lower than Type D and 14 yuan lower than Type A. This is an unprecedented occurrence since the issuance of unified national bonds. Market buyers were scattered and not organized, with Lianyi and Lianhe being slightly more successful. Hongda, Chengkang, and Yongkang also bought in, while Xie Kang and Shunli sold out and then bought in. In addition to Tongli, Jiufeng, Yichang, Xinfeng, Dazhong, and Hongxing also sold, but the amounts were not large. The reason was entirely due to the pressure from spot goods. Before this route is completely cleared, even if there is a recovery in the market, it will inevitably be frustrated. As a result, the market price fell unevenly. Type A only fell by 1.7 yuan, while Type E fell by as much as 4 yuan. The total turnover was about 1.4 to 1.5 million yuan. A simple table is listed below:</p>

China Underwear rose from 23.75 yuan to 25.75 yuan. Xinya Pharmaceutical (new) was at 37 yuan. Zhongfa (new) traded at 62 yuan. Shenghua rose 1.75 yuan to reach 24 yuan, with few sellers.

<p>The over-the-counter market for cash gold first rose and then fell, with the 22,000 yuan mark being re-entered. This was due to the resurgence of a certain gold shop and the silver building industry, as well as speculative selling by the Tianjin gang. It is clear that everyone's hearts are unstable. The initial trading price in the morning was 22,300 yuan, 100 yuan higher than the afternoon price. At that time, under the buying momentum of the gold and securities gangs, it rose to 22,500 yuan. Another securities firm acted on behalf of the Tianjin gang to sell off, and a certain gold shop, cash shop, and the silver building industry followed suit, causing the price to gradually decline to 850 yuan. At 11:25 AM, it retreated to 21,650 yuan. Later, there were few sellers, and the price at noon had risen to around 21,850 yuan, 50 yuan higher than the previous day's noon price, but 350 yuan lower than the afternoon price.</p>
<p>The price of gold ornaments per tael in silver shops was first lowered to 2,250 yuan by Daxiang counterparts, and then to 2,300 yuan, a flat [price], (a 300 yuan reduction for purchases). Patterned silver was listed at 18 yuan. The black market price was between 16.5 yuan and 17 yuan. Silver coins were bought at 9.5 yuan apiece, but selling required 10 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e74">The Value of Currency Changes: What is the Reason? <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw stable prices for British and American gold pounds, with the former remaining at 480 yuan and the latter remaining at 490 yuan. US dollar bills were being bought at 35 yuan. Hong Kong dollar bills continued to rise to 5.3 yuan, with large bills being 0.1 yuan lower. Military currency suddenly surged, opening at 7.39 yuan in the morning, rising to 0.45 yuan after opening, then suddenly falling to 0.35 yuan. In the afternoon, it suddenly rose to 7.6 yuan, a sharp increase of 0.25 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The discount rate for cross-clearing bills rose from 11 yuan to about 30 yuan per thousand yuan, an increase of 20 yuan. The money industry association's interbank lending rate remained at 0.13 yuan. The premium for Central Reserve Bank notes was 0.35 to 0.36 yuan per yuan, which was also significantly different from the previous day. Therefore, yesterday's currency and banknote market was all on the rise.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Bill Exchange <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Changes After the Original Method is Restored: The Shanghai Banking Association Joint Preparatory Committee (i.e., the bill exchange), has decided to restore the timed bill exchange system from May 1st (i.e., each exchange bank will send personnel with bills to the exchange at the beginning of the exchange time to handle bill exchange matters), and has formulated 18 articles of measures, which are summarized below: From the date of implementation of these measures, the timed bill exchange system originally implemented by the association before September 15th, 30th year of the Republic, shall be restored immediately. All specially contracted banks with account numbers before No. 42 shall still be called "exchange banks", and those with total numbers of No. 50 and branch numbers shall still be called "trustee exchange banks". The daily bill exchange time is 2:00 PM from Monday to Friday, and 12:15 PM on Saturday The exchange of bills shall be carried out separately according to the following currency types: Central Reserve Bank notes, cash, cross-clearing. The remaining articles are generally similar to the measures before September 15th, 30th year of the Republic, and are omitted due to the length of the text.</p>

<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday, due to the continuous increase in yarn prices and Eastern cloth prices, both inside and outside hoarders were only buying and not selling, making the supply of goods even tighter. As a result, the prices of all cloths reached new highs. Sixteen-pound Earth brand coarse cloth rose from 260 yuan to 265 yuan, Flying Goose 250 yuan, eight-pound Zhenzhong 138 yuan, fourteen-pound One Deer 239 yuan, twelve-pound Earth brand fine cloth 238 yuan, Fugui fine cloth 225 yuan, factory orders 190 yuan, Fugui fine twill 200 yuan, spot goods 198 yuan, Peach Blossom Ladies' Forest 356 yuan, Chick Prosperity Dream 355 yuan, all had transactions opening.</p>

<p>Yesterday, there were rumors that early and late rice speculation suddenly became expensive. It has been rumored for a long time that rice prices would increase by 5 or 6 jiao soon. Du rice took advantage of the public's anxiety about insufficient rice supply and took the initiative to raise prices by 130 yuan consecutively in recent days, which was truly shocking to hear. In the French Concession, rice prices rose from 518 yuan to 520 yuan, then to 525 yuan, 528 yuan, and finally to 530 yuan, directly reaching 535 yuan. In the British Concession, prices rose from 543 yuan, 545 yuan, to 550 yuan. Thick japonica rice was 535 yuan to 545 yuan, an increase of about 120 yuan compared to before. Throughout the day, prices fluctuated, and the difference between the lowest and highest prices was as much as tens of yuan, a misfortune for the people's food supply.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Soybean Prices Rise <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>

<h3 id="e83">Switzerland - A World Paradise <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— Xuan</p>
<p>In this world war full of flames, almost all countries in the world have been dragged into the whirlpool of war. A few countries, such as Turkey, still maintain neutrality, but they are closely related to the war and may inevitably participate at any time. Only Switzerland, located in Europe and surrounded by great powers, has always stayed out of the conflict, maintaining a clean land and living up to its reputation as a world paradise. Two years ago, when bloody battles were raging around Switzerland, tens of thousands of French and Polish soldiers fled into Switzerland. Fortunately, although Switzerland is small, it has a strong and respected army that detained all the French and Dutch soldiers who crossed the border and strictly guarded the border, striving to maintain neutrality, so that it could safely survive the huge waves of the war.</p>
<p>We may as well take a tour of Switzerland in our imagination, but this is not a time for sightseeing, but to learn something about the Swiss army. When entering Switzerland at a checkpoint, you can see two soldiers guarding it, wearing gray-green military uniforms and helmets with special styles. One of them is obviously a farmer, with rough hands and feet and a strong physique; the other looks like a young student. At this time, tourists should ask the Swiss guide: "How many years must Swiss citizens serve in the military in peacetime, or is there a professional army?" Let's listen to how the guide answers:</p>
<p>Switzerland is a small country and cannot afford to maintain a standing army. It only has a militia system. The constitution stipulates that the basic duty of citizens is to serve a period of military service. If they are physically unfit or overseas, they must pay taxes in lieu of service. If officers can understand the feelings of soldiers, the relationship between the two parties will be extremely harmonious. Therefore, Swiss citizens serving in the military are treated equally, regardless of class. The two guards at the checkpoint obviously have different social ranks, but in the army, wearing the same military uniform, they must obey orders.</p>
<p>"The language and religion of the Swiss people also differ. About 71 percent speak Swiss German, 21 percent speak French, 6 percent speak Italian, and 1 percent speak Romansh (derived from ancient Latin). 57 percent of the people believe in Protestantism, and 41 percent believe in Catholicism. However, they are united by the common purpose symbolized by the Swiss flag.</p>
<p>"The Swiss military system is different from other countries. It is composed of men from all over the country, maintaining the highest defense strength with the lightest burden. Young people who reach the age of 20 must enlist in the army and receive four months of rigorous training, learning to use various modern weapons. In the following 12 years, they will hold annual exercises eight times, each time for 18 days. At the age of 32, they will be assigned to the second-line reserve army. Until the age of 40, they must undergo two more exercises, each time for 18 days. From the age of 40 to 48, they belong to the National Defense Army, and are only called for inspection for one day a year in peacetime. The Swiss government recently issued an order that, in the event of general mobilization, the military service age will be extended from 48 to 60, and people of the soldier class must serve for at least 32 years.</p>
<p>"Citizens of the soldier class are issued firearms and stored in their homes. During mobilization, they only need to return home, take off their casual clothes, put on their military uniforms, and carry their equipment to assemble. Therefore, during the First World War in 1914, the mobilization of the Swiss army was the first to be completed. In addition to the 18-day annual exercise, the public must also practice rifle target shooting, 30 rounds per year. If they fail, they must continue to receive training. Shooting in Switzerland is known as a national skill. Every village has a shooting range for men to practice, and competitions are often held, which has become one of the important events in Swiss social life. Since the Swiss people are skilled in shooting and the army is purely defensive, the term of service for the people in the military can be reduced to the minimum. Since the 16th century, Switzerland has never tried to expand its territory, and its only purpose is to maintain freedom."</p>

<p>——One of Aizi's New Interpretations</p>
<p>Tonight, Aizi drank a few more glasses of wine and fell asleep in a daze. He vaguely began to dream.</p>
<p>A great man walked towards him and introduced himself: "I am the Dragon King of the East Sea. I have come to visit you because I admire your talent."</p>
<p>"You are too kind," Aizi said after bowing. "What can I do for you?"</p>
<p>"I want to find a son-in-law..."</p>
<p>"This is something ordinary people cannot do..." Aizi interrupted.</p>
<p>"No, no!" The Dragon King hurriedly defended: "We don't intermarry with ordinary people. What I mean is, I can't find a suitable aquatic creature to be my son-in-law. Please give me some advice."</p>
<p>"Oh!" Aizi calmed down and continued. "First, what are the conditions?"</p>
<p>"He will be my son-in-law without any conditions. I will give him pearls, corals, and countless other treasures from the sea. In addition, I will give him a fief and make him my vassal, so that he can enjoy happiness."</p>
<p>"Then what is your Majesty's temper like?" Aizi asked again.</p>
<p>"This is the crux of the problem. I have a very bad temper, and so does my daughter, so I don't want to recruit a dragon as my son-in-law, lest everyone act impulsively."</p>
<p>"Your Majesty is probably also suspicious?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Ai is really speaking my mind," the Dragon King said with a smile.</p>
<p>"In this case," Aizi rubbed his palms and said, "In the eyes of ordinary people, only the shrimp is qualified to enter the inner circle."</p>
<p>"The shrimp is qualified to be selected?" The Dragon King was extremely suspicious.</p>
<p>"Please don't underestimate the shrimp, he has three virtues: First, he has no heart or lungs, showing no differences; second, he has no blood, which the king can punish at will; third, his head is covered in mud, so he can be humble, and even if you ask him to burrow into manure to become a speculator, it doesn't matter."</p>
<p>"Good, good!" The Dragon King left satisfied.</p>
<p>Aizi's dream was over, and my "new interpretation" was also over, but the shrimp was still dreaming an endless dream.</p>
<h3 id="e86">The Power to Unfold <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Ye Meizhen</p>
<p>Here's another example: Lincoln's stepmother was just a housewife. Busy with daily chores all day long. But she taught and inspired her husband's son. As a result, Lincoln freed the slaves by the torch given by her. Lincoln once wrote in a letter: "You ask me what is the greatest book I have ever redeemed? I tell you, it is my stepmother!" She was just a housewife. But she was able to instill the love of God and the world into her husband's heart. So became the greatest evangelist of the time.</p>
<p>We do not believe that the great cause of the world must be created by one person alone. But Emerson said, "A great cause is just the shadow of one person unfolding." He also said, "There is no great or small. Others are greater than me because they have ignited the divine spark; and I have not. We have accomplished nothing because we despise ourselves and have not recognized the power of our position." Jesus said, "If you can have a mustard seed of faith, then you will accomplish everything!"</p>
<p>We firmly believe a simple fact; that is, life must have a purpose. The seeds of divine power are to be cultivated and released by us. The method is obvious. Our duty is to work tirelessly. A young man without faith will say, "I am worthless." But a young man with correct ideas will say, "I am priceless!" And try to prove it.</p>
<p>Napoleon has a wise saying: "Environment? I can create the environment." This is not something only an arrogant person would say. This is a fact. We can each create the environment!</p>

<p>— Ma Lan</p>
<p>Life is a point of view that turns red and green, or happy or sad, through the eyes of your prejudice. So the wise say that each person creates their own life. This is quite reasonable.</p>
<p>You can make your life valuable and meaningful. So no one only dwells on the past, saying that the past years were better than today. You live in the present moment, and what you have to grasp is only the present moment, but you can, and must, strive for the future moment. The past is just an unavoidable existence, and the loss of the present moment can predict that a new force will flow from the future to the past.</p>

<h3 id="e88">Roadside Horrors <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Lan</p>
<p>Traffic accidents occur frequently on American highways, and countless people are unjustly killed by cars every year. As a result, experts are thinking about an effective roadside marker to warn drivers to slow down. One expert said that the symbol of death is the most powerful. So he suggested using a skull and waist as a roadside marker to warn careless drivers. It is said that this suggestion may be adopted during the "Safety Movement" season.</p>

<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(4) In the lingering glow of the setting sun</p>
<p>Guofang said, "Let's go over there and see what's planted in the field?" Cuizhen walked in front, smiling, "I know more about this than you do. What's growing in the field with green leaves is wheat. After a rain at the end of last year, the leaves grew quickly. Some fields have not planted anything yet, preparing to sow cotton seeds after Qingming. If water has been drained into the field, then rice seeds must be sown. Miss Guofang, if you come to us in April, it will be very lively: the rice seedlings emerging from the water; the cotton stalks in the cotton fields; are so tall. Broad bean flowers, rapeseed flowers, purple, yellow, frogs croaking in the water, on the river beach: swallows flying around, as busy as farmers; that's really lively." Guofang said, "I know, that's the busy farming season. Every summer vacation, my siblings and I return to my grandmother's place. Although we live in town, we can often see the scenery of the countryside. Sister Cuizhen, how about you and Brother Weicheng come to Shuangqiao together during the summer vacation?" Cuizhen agreed and said, "I'm afraid Aunt Ye's cousin is gone, I will be busy, maybe I can't come."</p>
<p>The two walked along the way, even if they did not forget how far they had traveled, they felt that walking like this was a pleasure. Guofang, after all, was not much different from "unable to distinguish beans from wheat", pointed to the grass by the field, treated it as wheat, and said, "This wheat is indeed very easy to propagate, growing on the bank of the field." Cuizhen leaned down to pick grass leaves and wheat leaves, compared them for Guofang to see, and said that this was grass, and this was wheat. Guofang smiled, "People from the countryside are laughed at by people in Shanghai; but people from Shanghai in the countryside are also laughed at by people in the countryside. Sister Cuizhen, you are so good, you not only didn't laugh at me, but also patiently guided me. If you were my sister, or my cousin, I wouldn't let you marry, I would keep you at home, and talk and laugh with me, how good would that be. Sister Cuizhen, don't you think what I said is what a child would say?" Guofang, while speaking, only put her face on Cuizhen's arm. But Cuizhen stood by the bank of the field and smiled, "No one will want me." This sentence was nothing more than telling Guofang that she was not engaged to anyone. (63)</p>
