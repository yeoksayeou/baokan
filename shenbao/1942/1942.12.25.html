<h3>再論厲行消費節約</h3>
<p>關於行政機關與業務機關，當前應予厲行消費節約各點，昨已略加列論，茲更就社會團體以及個人人消費節約，貢其愚見，以吿國人。</p>
<p>（一）限制消費合作社經售物品種類　消費合作社經售之物品，應以生活必需品　限，糖果，香烟等消耗品，應禁止經售。</p>
<p>（二）利用合作社實施限額配銷　利用合作機構，根據社員家屬人數及實際需要物品數量，實施限額分配。　　（三）提倡物品代用　對生產不足之物品，提倡以其他物品代用：對價昂量稀之物品，提倡以價廉量多之物品代用，（例如以荳漿代替牛奶）獎勵發明代用方法並推廣之。</p>
<p>（四）限奢侈品之運銷與製造　禁止奢侈品之運銷，限制奢侈品之製造，並有計劃的移用原有生產奢侈品之人力物力於生產必需品之事業。</p>
<p>（五）推廣公用合作　理髮室，浴室，洗衣等公用合作事業，應　量推廣，以節减一般之生活費用。</p>
<p>（六）推廣公共食堂　减少小家庭單獨開伙，以節省人力物力之消耗。</p>
<p>（七）限制娛樂塲所及飲食店之添設及營業時間，夜晚之營業時間，尤應提早結束，以减少不必要之消費，並應嚴格限止添設。</p>
<p>（八）節省電力　實行早起早睡，减少電力消耗。（九）减少應酬　婚喪喜慶之宴會及饋贈，儘量减少舖張。宴會筵席費應有限度，每桌最高不得超過三四百元。　（十）提倡短衣節食　節約布料，及不必要之華麗穿着，節减糧食，及其他食品之消費。最後，本報以本位立塲，對於文化事業，亦略舉下列數點以自勉勉人：</p>
<p>（一）减少機關團體之公報刊物　除必要之公報刊物外，應盡量减少。</p>
<p>（二）限制雜誌篇幅　各種雜誌，應限制頁數，俾减少不必要之篇幅，並提高文字之質，而節减其量。</p>
<p>（三）减少報紙篇幅　採精編主義，擷取新聞要點，去無存菁，避免新聞之重複，縮小廣吿面　，節約紙張及其他消耗。（於此點，本報正在依此標準，通籌設計中。）</p>

<h3>和英美相結合的蘇聯之予盾　十二月十九日朝日新聞社論</h3>
<p>大東亞戰爭，是和歐洲戰爭融合一起，以謀世界新秩序之建立的。在民主主義擁護的名義下，犧牲他民族，特別是東洋民族，從而使自己繁榮起來，這是英美人一世紀以來的慣技。對這毒辣的英美人的全權世界支配，我日德義同盟站在道義的世界觀上，行了果敢的抗爭。不待言的，這是一個生死的大決鬬。正因爲有着明確的共同作戰的目的，日　義的締盟才得成爲鞏問的團結。</p>
<p>英美兩國迷戀於以功利世界觀爲基礎的世界支配，這事即使不足怪，但連蘇聯也參加了聯合的一翼，這矛盾實在太大了。</p>
<p>蘇聯所抱的世界觀，和英美的世界觀，無論從那一點看來，都是背道而馳的。所以我們只能說：由於德蘇戰爭之勃發，作爲一時的手段，他們才結合起來，實則毫無共通之可言。蘇聯和英美帝國主義。本質上就不相容，現在英美的指導者被蘇聯呼爲「大資本的代辦者」，更爲衆所周知的事實。因此，這些大資本的代辦者們，對蘇聯抱着政治的，思想的，甚至民族的，以及潛在的種種憎惡和反感，也是不難想像的。結果，內含着報些矛盾的聯合國之羣，必然就會發生破綻，而且，現在也早已發生着破綻和龜裂了。</p>
<p>隨時暴露着的這兩者作戰之不一致，正是基於相互不信任和猜疑之由來。就近事學例，十月四日，史太林對英美援蘇表示不滿，父對英美開闢第二戰錢問題提出質問，値得注意的是，對這質問，英美言論界竟大舉反撥，有意無意間，十足暴露了對蘇感情之惡劣。迢暗示着英美指導層對蘇的眞意向，無論如何是隱蓋不了的。還有十一月末克里浦斯之退出英戰時內閣，也和英對蘇關係有着密切的關聯。本年二月間，屢戰屢敗地弄得英國焦頭爛額，不得已，只好把戰爭遂行的責任推在蘇聯一人身上，因此，邱吉爾才拼命壓着內心的嫌惡使親蘇派的左翼健將克里浦期人閣，俾能盡量迎合蘇聯的意向，然而此中的弄作，是隨時都有爆發之可能的。最近的北非戰局，由邱吉爾的主觀看來，以爲是英國方面形勢好轉了，於是戰爭遂行的自信就有幾分回復了過來。結果，就使英國脫去假面，趕走左派克里浦斯。打開天窗說亮話，英國已把蘇聯利用够了。不但如此，蘇聯在昨今兩年度對德作戰中實力消耗了不少，實在已沒有決定的反擊力了。看準這一點，才把克里浦斯推回了第二綫。</p>
<p>明白了這一層，我們才能窺知英對蘇關係之本質。英國慣用的對外政策，是多麼老獪，自私，爲自己打算呵。</p>
<p>其次得小心的，是美英策動的日蘇離間策。大家都知道，美英一向以第一流的謀略宣傳，不斷地在刺激日蘇兩國，要想在兩國間放一把火。美英在對德戰中利用了蘇聯還不够，他們還想策動日蘇火災，藉此使蘇聯負擔更大的犧牲；這實可說是惡辣之極的一條苦肉計。</p>
<p>英美對蘇聯，其態度及政策之恶毒，旣如上述。今後，因著情勢少推移，蘇聯將從英美那里受到背信的待遇，是不言可喩的。和不講信義的人講什麼背信　背信，實在是愚不可及的事。正確地把握英美的眞意，乃是蘇聯當務之急。</p>
<h3>軸心增援北非部隊　陸續在沿海登陸　協約軍分三路展開攻勢　遭德空軍大隊猛襲受挫</h3>
<p>里斯本二十四日中央社電　綜合此問所接突尼西亞戰綫消息、軸心軍最近每日以平均　千人之部隊、在突尼西亞海岸登陸並陸續增援戰車及裝甲事、其中尤以戰車部隊、曾在馬其諾戰綫積有豐富經騐、堪稱最爲精銳、據英國廣播電台前綫特派員電稱、反軸心軍總司令埃森霍、頃正以安德森所部英軍第一軍爲左翼，美軍居中、法叛軍爲右翼、展開對軸心軍攻勢、但此計劃因軸心空軍痛炸其兵站綫之結果、似已受阻云，</p>
<p>瑞士京城二十三日哈瓦斯社電　據柏林電訊、軸心國與協約國海軍正在北非阿爾及利要東海岸附近、發生海戰、緣當協約國軍艦一隊、掩護運輸艦數艘、向蒲琪港駛去之際、適爲軸心國偵察機羣所瞥見、當即加派飛機馳往投彈、並由潛水艇放射魚雷、加以襲擊、計擊中一萬五千噸運輸艦二艘，並有英美潛水艇一艘、被我驅逐艦擊沉、此外、我方並擊落英國飛機五架、重創其驅逐艦一艘、且截至發電時爲止、雙方海戰尙在進行中，</p>
<p>柏林二十四日海通社電　里比亞前綫、昨日仍甚沉寂、英國第八路軍之前哨部隊、現以極謹愼之態度、追蹤軸心軍隊、推進至緩、英國大隊工兵正從事於沙漠中及沿海岸地雷之掃除、因其爲英軍推進之最大障礙也、突尼西亞前綫、參加英美作戰之法國騎兵一隊、已在龐杜伐被德軍完全殲減、法方損失戰馬四十匹、陣亡百人、及被俘戰具無算、德國轟炸機隊現正大隊轟炸英軍之運輸綫、本星期內、軸心空軍在阿爾及爾海岸、計共擊沉英美船隻達四萬九千噸云、</p>

<h3>華北最前線巡禮（對談會）　（四）</h3>
<p>衆議院議員　津雲國利　衆議院秘書長　大木　操</p>
<p>譯自三十一年十二月「現代」</p>
<p>在最前線作戰的將士</p>
<p>記者：　那麼請你們在這裏轉變活題，談一談在第一綫根據地或最前綫之陣地的日軍之情形，是怎麼樣的。</p>
<p>津雲：　這是最緊要的事了。我曾訪問在山西省的運城之最前綫。大木先生是從包頭度過黃河，到奧爾特斯地方的最前綫去的吧？</p>
<p>大木：　我於九月二十四日，在大同乘夜車，捆在毛毯中，於二十五日抵達包頭。從這裏度過黃河，在前行二十公哩的奧爾特斯平原，所謂共產軍跋扈着，而日軍在這裏有着與之對峙的日軍第一綫。黃河的河幅在這附近有二百公呎左右，由工兵攙扶着渡過，前後隨着衛兵，我們一行抵達最前綫部隊駐搭的地方。到那裏只見有五六間用泥瓦造成的村舍，四面圍着土塀，是否能藉之禦寒，頗成問題。日軍將士就是在這種地方日夜執着槍守備着。在我們去慰勞的不久前，匪賊曾到這土塀附近實行夜襲。匪賊持有機關槍，實力頗爲雄厚，日軍迅即應戰，將之擊退，可是不幸某少尉以下兵士數名陣亡。同隊的兵士，親手把他們的墓標建立在兵舍的側面，衷心祈禱着他們的冥福。這樣地乘着黑夜之中，匪賊會神出鬼沒，所以他們說連一分鐘也不能疏於戒備。我曾於前年之春，慰勞華中的最前綫，這次在這裏又體騐了最前綫的一切，充分體味到將士的勞苦，覺得國民非衷心對之表示感謝不可。這裏是荒僻的村落，只有二三年前衆議院議員的慰勞團，曾渡過黃河到這裏來過一次，自從事變以來，衆議院議長慰勞華北及蒙疆的最前綫，還是破天荒第一次，並且又特地探訪到這般荒僻的地方，兵士們都非常感激。</p>
<p>津雲：　我於夜間從大同向太原出發，不是備着臥架的火車，我也只好向軍隊借一塊毛毯，捆着过夜。到朔縣地方天剛破曉，火車漸漸趨近山地。不久，火車夾着一萬尺左右的高山之間，向前急駛。從車窗望去，凡是在最高的山頂上，都立着一個堡壘，上面飄揚着太陽旗，在這下面站着握槍的兵士，在夾着胡沙的朔風中保護着我們所乘的火車和軌道。我們覺得非常感激。一行都被感動得流淚了。我所見的第一綫，是在山西省的南端，運城附近，是河東鹽的出產地。乘着運貨汽車沿着那著名的鹽池，經三小時的時間，才得從運城越過嶮岨的中條山脈。慰勞了此處所駐的部隊，在這裏宿了一夜，第二天早晨乘着馬馳過汽車無法通過的道路，經一小時餘抵達黃河河岸之最前綫村落駐搭部隊的陣地。這時候適逢作戰的當中，敵方用機關槍，我方及用山砲應戰。</p>

<h3>吃飯與貸金　學生向輿論呼籲　希望公平與簡單</h3>
<p>上次我簡單的報告了關於內地貸學金的內幕，這裏又是一個學生向輿論界呼籲的一封信，特地摘錄在下面，</p>
<p>「今天功課表上只有下午有一堂課，作些甚麼事績好呢？同學多半上課去了，宿舍里清冷清地，找不到人聊天；這種死寂的空氣，夠悶人的。</p>
<p>眼光偶爾碰到掛　上的「十三」兩個鮮明的大字——這麼個可厭而不祥的日子——倒使我深深地吃了一驚，我繳的膳費只够吃兩天飯了，怎麼辦呢？若是不馬上想法子，後天也許有絕食之虞；半月前寫給哥哥告急的信，還沒有回音，申請了好久的貸金，也不知吉凶何如，老許昨天好像來了掛號信，若是匯來了錢的話，多少可通融一二；老李有的是錢，可是他捨不得借給人家，還是不必碰鼻的好；老王的錢早給捷足者借去了，他那裏是無法可想的；現在還剛剛開學，就鬧窮，這一學期怎麼過得完呢？</p>
<p>我呆呆地躺在床上，窗外青翠的松樹，伴着微風輕輕地嘆息；從樹枝隙縫裏漏出乳濁的天空老是那樣哭喪着臉，前天在野郊採來的南國早熟的桃花，也顯得十分的憔悴，幾片頽衰的死瓣，無力的跌落在桌上，我輕輕地吹着口哨，想趕去這壓鬱的空氣；可是「膳費」「吃飯」……的陰影，反更强烈顯明地在我頭腦中映現。</p>
<p>突然，門被推開，老許走了進來，似乎是一肚皮的不高興：</p>
<p>「太沒有道理了！」</p>
<p>「什麽事？」我一面從床上坐起，一面問他。</p>
<p>「貸金審核的結果公佈了，他媽的，我還只是自費乙！」</p>
<p>「我呢？我呢？你看到麼？」</p>
<p>「你是自費甲？」</p>
<p>一綫光明掃還我的眼前，膳費，吃飯什麽都解決了，到底天無絕人之路，房內每一件東西都好像對我微笑；我全身的細胞，忽然感覺異樣的輕鬆和愉快，使我的身體好像添了無窮的熱力，我興高采烈的站起來，真想痛快的大笑一塲。</p>
<p>但是我看到許君冷冷的面孔，我想到應該安慰安慰這位失望的朋友。</p>
<p>「不要緊的！自費乙也好，還有沒有批准的哩！」</p>
<p>「哼！我不知道貸金委員會是憑什麽來審查的，像李××居然也是戰區甲。」</p>
<p>「什麽？他是戰區甲？他不是很充裕的嗎？昨天我看見他在宿舍里燉肉吃，今天早晨他還在這裏誇耀他那一百元一雙的皮鞋，爲什麽他能得到戰區生貸金的呢？」</p>
<p>「你不知道嗎？人家的貸金申請人是院長呀！這一個時候反正什麽都是「面子問題」，院長代爲申請，還有不準的道理。」他氣憤的說。</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>「貸金委員會是根據有沒有家境清寒證書和你的申請人的「面子」來審查的，可是越是真正清寒，越弄不到清寒證書；我在原籍縣政府沒有一個熱人，直到今天還領不到這張清寒證，呈文去了兩三封，鬼纔理你啦！等到貸金將要查核了，我纔請我們這舍的中隊長黃教官作申請人，我的意思，因爲他是比較接近我們，學校當然相信他能知道我們真實的境况，誰知他在學校里沒有「面子」，竟使我得了個自費乙；那些請教授們申請的，至少是自費甲；至於院長，「面子」更大，當然是戰區貸金了。」</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>「他媽的！憑我這套衣服，看是不是應該批准甲種。」</p>
<p>人們多少有些自私自利的心理，雖然聽了他這多不平的牢騷，但我仍在私心慶幸我個人的問題得以解決，我不知不覺地說出：</p>
<p>「管牠哩，我後天的吃飯問題總算不用愁了！」…</p>
<p>「你別高興，這是核准，發錢的日子還遙遙無期！」</p>
<p>「怎麼」！</p>
<p>「學校要將核准貸金生的名單，呈送教育部，教育部核擬我們這裏每月膳費的數目，再由重慶發下錢來，至少還得兩個月。」</p>
<p>「你昨天來了掛號信，能借點錢我麼？我後天就沒飯吃了！」</p>
<p>「我也在愁着呢，昨天來的是包裹。」</p>
<p>「我怔住了；這一下又使我墮入冷水的深潭。</p>

<h3>上海教育界之難關</h3>
<p>— 江風</p>
<p>上海以全國最大都市之地位，大中小學各級教育之發展，均佔極重要之地位。雖以數量過多，良莠容有不齊，其於作育人才，提高文化之努力，尚多足取。數年來，時局動盪，舉世不甯，而滬濱絃誦之聲，迄未少輟，一方固由地方當局之愛護有加；一方亦有賴教界人員之艱苦自守。無如生活狀况，日見困難，竊感教育界前途，殊多荊棘。約其大要，蓋有四點：</p>
<p>一曰·教育費用之劇增　上海學校林立，公立者但居少數，私立者實佔大半。私立各校，以前辦理立案，原有籌定基金之定章，然大多不過敷衍公事，並無的款。其確有資產者，又往往受人把持，反多糾葛。或則置有地產，而事變以來，不克自用，亦更增負担。以至開支各項，端賴學費。於是學費一再遞增，小學普通每學期均須百元乃至百五六十元，中學自百數十元乃至二百數十元，大學三百餘元。而書籍文具之費尚不在內，小學輒須五六十元，中學百元以上，大學更有多至數百元者。而學校方面，且有考試用紙另行收費之怪現象。至若學校距家較遠者，車費膳食，尚不計焉，此項費用，富裕者固猶不以爲意，清寒者其將何以應付？</p>
<p>二曰·教育設備之空虛　現代之教育，不能徒賴教師以課本講義講解塞責，尤以大中學爲然，圖書之參考，實騐之設備與材料，必不可少。乃事變以來，各校原有之圖書設備，大多喪失。稍有補充，殊屬寥寥。而新設各校，更屬空虛。各校經費困難，自屬實情，然當局藉口推托而飽入私囊者，亦或有之。近一年來，實騐材料，更形昂貴。乃至有實騐室者亦閉不工作。教師講授，既苦參證不便，學生肄習，益感瞭解困難。青年之中，好學者尚可稍窺門徑，庸驚者自可一味敷衍。教育之代價日高，而程度日降，可不懼哉！</p>
<p>三曰·教育制度之混亂　我國教育制度，在戰前方得規模組具，雖本臻完善，固定有系統。比年以來，弊賓業生，殊多可慮。一則科目之取舍，漫無標準，中學或重理輕文，或擯棄史地。大學則必修之科目，輒以人少不開，妄將他課代替。凡此諸端，顯非正道。二則時間之伸縮，有妨工作鐘點長短，學期起訖，均可自由，大多不免偷工减料之嫌。嚴寒盛暑，向例休學，原以藏修息游，應有定時。今則暑校既成通例，甚有以一年分三學期，暑期上課，一如平時者。在學校當局固可多收學費，另得盈餘，在師生則揮汗上課，徒托空談。三則學籍之稽考，失所憑藉。年來一部份不知自檢之學校，或濫招學生，任令獵級，或出售僞證，聽其升學。是尤爲今日上海教育界之大病。</p>
<p>四曰·教育人員之困乏　教師待遇，在戰前私立大學薪給，每月可得二三百元，中學一二百元，小學至少三四十元。今物價之漲，大致在二十倍以上，米價且不止此數；而米之一項，在昔於支出中無關重要，今則在家庭開支中且居半數。然教師薪給，較之戰前，多者不過四五倍，少者倘不及三倍。教師階級，大多　素，當此之際，唯有少數女教師之無須贍養家族者，差堪溫飽。普通以平時辛勤之積蓄，隨時賠補，爲日既久，早苦難乎爲繼。典質衣物，究屬有限。於是一方面不得不力求節省，甚至營養不足，隱疾諱醫。一方面不得不多任工作，稍資彌補。大學教師任課至三十小時，中學四十小時，小學另兼二三門館者，頗屬尋常。勞頓至此，以言收入。其不足應付開支之半數者，尚居多數。而一學期中，在開始時尚覺差堪滿意，及終了時早已相差千里。以言工作，則一人之精力有限，僕僕風塵，舌敝　焦，博學者或勉能應付，中庸者自不免敷衍。甚至用非所長，尤屬事倍功半。教育水準，又何能望其提高？</p>
<p>以上種種，均屬上海教育界極嚴重之病象。欲謀澈底之改革，誠屬匪易。然似此情形，倘不亟圖補救，誠恐上海之教育，卽不陷於破產，亦且失其效用。連日各方輿論，已屢有論列，　具體方案，似尚未周詳。茲更縷陳數點於左：</p>
<p>（一）關於改善教師待遇者</p>
<p>（甲）增加各項配給之數額　教師境遇之困難，端在配給之米麺油糖等數量不足。而此項不足，對於月薪固定而且極少增加之教師，在各業中最爲受累。一則賴黑市補充，費用浩大，二則教師及家族既不易親自軋買，大多亦已無力僱用傭僕。故在配給量未能普遍適合各人需要之前，應就各教師直系親屬之同居而無職業者，按口補助。大中小學教師之補助額，得酌予差別；大學程度較高而人數又少，自可稍爲優待，小學人數衆多，不妨略减。兼　　校者，以及夫婦同爲教師之親屬，均不得領重份。在工部局學校等處，已有額外津貼者，亦應另定限制。其監察方法等項，當另訂之。但教師仍照配給品之公定價格照付。則在教師不爲徒哺啜，而在當局亦不至負擔過重矣。</p>
<p>（乙）减少教師子女之學費　教師生活清苦，頗有身爲教師，而子女不能入學之危險。竊仿醫師親屬互診免費之例，凡教師子女入學，各校均應予以半費或免費之優待，是亦教育界互助之一法，深望各校能及早自動實行！</p>
<p>（二）關於補助充實設備者</p>
<p>（甲）各種　書，亟宜配備完全，尤以教科書爲然。各校備辦圖書，當局英勸導各書局特予减價。</p>
<p>（乙）儀器設備，亦應督促各校就已有者，儘量使用，不足者，設法使經售商家特別廉售。　　需用材料，亦仿此例。水電煤氣之費，倘能設法酌予减費，使各校授課，早晚不至暗中摸索，實騐不至有名無實，尤多實惠。此外，則各校合用之實騐室，倘能分區佈置，輪流借用，則於　學教育，尤爲有益。</p>
<p>（三）關於整頓教育制度者</p>
<p>上海教育行政，廢弛已久，亟應整頓。整頓之方，當首重課程學籍等項之管理，處理一切，一則應改爲完全由國人自辦，以免隔閡誤會，二則應由正式機關辦理，但須有資望相當之人員相機推進。</p>
<p>凡此數端，倘能見諸實行，則各校收費，自可不至隨物價而過分上漲。設備程度，均可力求改善。教師生活，亦將賴以安定。所望各方當局，及各校負責人員，均能通力合作，以收指　之效。庶幾上海之教育，非特安渡難關，且有重放光明之一日！</p>

<p>自有談</p>
<h3>耶穌與蔡鍔</h3>
<p>— 劍農</p>
<p>遙想一千九百四十多年前的今日，世界的光明，世人的福音耶穌，誕生在猶太國伯利恒地方的一個僻靜，簡陋，連寒風也難遮蔽的馬棚裏面了。眞的，你不相信他是世界的光明，世人的福音嗎？請想一想他的至理名言，是怎樣的光照了這幽暗世界，安慰了這痛苦的世人啊！</p>
<p>當他坐在山上，地一次公開教訓眾人的時候，他竟完全和常人理智相反的公然宣稱說：「有貧窮精神的是有幸福的！……良善的是有幸福的!……涕泣的是有幸福的……義如飢的是有幸福的！……慈悲的是有幸福的！……心凈的是有幸福的！……和平的是有幸福的！……爲義而受窘難的是有幸福的！」茫茫羣衆，聽了他這番奇特出人意料之外的言論以後，始而目瞪口呆，莫測高深，繼而額蹙眉顰，表示懷疑，最後纔心服首肯，豁然貫通了。於是他們那久受痛苦的心頭，纔透出一口輕鬆的氣；他們那久受痛苦籠罩的面龐，纔露一絲微弱的笑容；他們環顧身旁瞻望前途，也不似以前那麼一片漆黑，一片令人胆戰心驚的漆黑了！他們一個個這纔抖擻精神，有勇氣去走那人生的大道。我也盼望現在我們一總的人，在紀令耶穌誕生的今日，深深的咀嚼他那幾句能够啟發我們安慰我們的至理名言。</p>
<p>蔡鍔的精神和氣魄，當然和耶穌有其距離。然而當他在雲南都督仟的時候，軍民懷惠，想捐金給他鑄　銅像，建築生祠，他却把醵資騙到手裏遍遺飢民說:「……哀鴻嗷嗷，食此涓滴之賜，當可活命無算:彰人之功，不若活人之命。」—據陳一著新語林—則他這種慈腸俠骨，也是値得我們欽敬和仿效的！現花上海是有多少奄奄待斃的餓民凍民，等待着迫切的救濟啊！有　蔡松坡的仁聲而典起的沒有？我是在這紀念雲南起義的日子而深深的祝　着。（酬移寒衣捐）</p>
<h3>辛亥革命前黨報史略</h3>
<p>— 時</p>
<p>辛亥革命時，各地民衆運動風起盡湧，紛紛響應，這是當時革命報紙以百折不撓的精神，努力鼓吹　勵的結果。在那個時候，淸廷對於報紙起先因爲屈辱於外侮，爲維新而提倡，戊戍政變後，慈禧被國內輿論攻擊，於是老羞成怒，對於報紙取締甚嚴，對於輿論　泊甚力，想籍此來社絕革命運勤。光緒二十四年（一八九八年）八月二十四　，禁止天津，上海，漢口等處的報紙發行、，嚴行訪拿主　人。，但這個論旨並未生效，一般志士不爲利誘，不欋威脅，仍懷着滿腔熱血，爲革命而奮門。</p>
<p>最早的革命報紙　中國日報第一聲</p>
<p>最早主張革命的報紙，是光緒二十五年（一八九九年）在香港出版的中國日報，由總理派陳少白在香港主持，提倡民族主義，主張排滿，其最　天的一篇文字，是一民主主義與中國政治革命之前途」。相繼而興辦的有蘇報，國民日日報，警鐘日報，廣東報，有所謂報，少年報，民呼報，民旺報，民立報，天鐸報，復報，民報，廿世紀之新支那等：至於廣東報，有所謂報，少年報等，論調比中國日報要溫和些，而目也不像中國日報那樣的是純粹的宣傳報。其中因文字獄而轟動一時，並且影響最太的，要算是蘇報案。蘇報創刊於光緒二十三年（一八九七年）夏，先由胡鐵梅經營，但負食出面是他的一位日本太太生駒悅，在駐滬日總領事館註冊，後由陳範出資購得，他是湖南衡山人，因敎案罷去江西知縣官職，恨官場腐敗，要想由淸議喚醒國人，其中張先屬保皇黨，後來看到康梁中張的不澈底，就改變爲革命派。</p>
<p>爲蘇報撰文的，有吳稚暉，章太炎，蔡元培，鄒容，徐鍚麟，秋瑾，最爲淸廷所注意。光緒二十九年（一九〇三年），蜀人鄒容組織愛國學社，出版革命軍一書，痛心疾首，以推翻滿淸爲職志，章太炎曾寫序文，並在蘇報的新書介紹欄內，說明這書的內容。淸廷大怒，在上海租界內將鄒章等多人捕獲，要求引渡，和界當局不允，歷經交涉不成，結果僅組織額外公堂會審，判鄒容監禁二年，章太炎監禁三年，鄒容後來病死獄中。章太炎於光緒三十二年（一九〇六年）六月二十七日期滿出獄赴東京。</p>
<p>蘇報中人並不因此灰心，於同年六月，發起創刊國民日日報，副刊「黑暗世界」，由速橫（慕秦）編輯，攻擊官僚不遺餘力，淸廷因鑑於租界交涉困難，就通令長江一帶嚴禁商民訂閱，並由外務部行文總我務司轉知郵局，勿代寄國民日日報，但當時郵局剛興起，報紙多由民信局寄遞，所以淸廷依然不能達到目的。</p>
<p>民報發出獅子吼　有紙貴洛陽之勢</p>
<p>同盟會成立後，總理爲發揮種族革命精神，宣揚三民主義眞諦，於光精三十一二年間在東京創辦復報和民報，復報由劉帥陪編輯，民報先由張繼編輯，持諭極為激烈，並且　中英文將主義要旨政綱要義刋在該報最　著的地位：（一）顚覆現今之惡劣政府：（二）土地國有：（三）離時世界眞正之和平；（四）建設共和政府；（五）要求各國贊成中國之革命新事業。總理在民報的發刋詞中，已經高揭民族民權民生三大主義，其中會有如此之闡述：</p>
<p>「余維歐美之進化，凡以三大主義：曰民族，曰民權，曰民生·羅馬之亡民族主義帝其國，威行專制，在下者不　北苦，則民權主義興。十八世紀之米，十九世紀之初，專制撲而立意政體殖焉。世界開化，人智益蒸，物買發舒，百年銳於千載。經濟問題，繼政治問題之後，則民生主義躍躍欲動，二十世紀，不得不為民生主義之間揚時代也。」</p>
<p>此外，民報取出色的幾篇文章，是民族的國民論，「支那立憲必　以革命和小說「獅子吼一。章太炎到東京後，就由他編輯，當時頗爲　者所歡迎和國際的重視，大有紙貴　陽之勢。</p>
<p>光復會的別派於于伯循（右任），著書排滿，異常激烈，在民報鼎盛於東京時代，由陝省到上海，和汪瘦岑，在秉忠等黨中中堅人物，組織神州日報，後來又創辦民呼日報，民吁日報和民立報，宋敎仁署名「漁夫」在民立報上發表光　逼人的文章，努力鼓吹革命主義。凡所議論，秉諸學理，能反覆說明淸政府的腐收，喚起國民担負國事的責任心，最受國內外智識階級的歡迎。</p>
<p>民立報光　逼人　佔當時黨報首位</p>
<p>這三報相承而生，在專制强橫壓迫之下，命運都極短促。民呼報宣統元年（一九〇九年）春創刊，專攻擊官塲的腐收，當道借故摧殘，于氏走日本，該報出版僅三十九日。同年秋季，由談善吾續辦民吁報，改變論調致力攻擊日本，駐滬日領請上海這封禁，出版也只有四十二日。第二年九月九日，又有民立報以大無畏的姿態出現，爲該報撰文的，有宋敎仁，呂志伊，王印則，章行　，覃　堃等，主張急　　態度平實，每天可銷二萬餘份，印機日夜不停，爲當時佔據首位的黨報。</p>
<p>民國成立，有「豎三民橫三民」的美稱，豎三民是民呼民吁民立，橫三民是戴天仇（傳賢）所創辦的民權，呂忠伊所創辦的國民新聞，鄧家志所創辦的中華民報。橫三民言論激烈，比較偏重於感情，所以民立報依然據着首位。後來于氏奔走國事，報務托人辦理，論調改變，銷數也就减低了。所僅存的只有神州日報一家。</p>
<p>康有爲走日本後，總理也由倫敦趕到，在日本的革命志士，都希望孫康携手，可以合力作大規模的進行，但總理是提倡民主的革命黨，康有爲却是主張君主立憲的保皇黨，終以君憲民主的根本上不容並立，兩派就分道揚鑣，愈離愈遠。保皇黨以梁啟超所主持的新民叢報爲根據，革命黨以張繼章太炎所主待的民報爲根據，雙方正式作民主君憲的論戟，鬥爭的結果，保皇失敗了，原來保皇當報紙所官傳的中心主張，是君主立憲；但淸廷的僞立憲運動準備立憲為名，破壞立憲爲其實，因此使保皇黨失其立塲。</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>

<p>黃龍正盼望維城嘴裏吐出這麼　句話來，說道；「誰說不走？走！」維城給黃龍一激，又有了黃龍做伴，眞是說走就走，站起來，是個引導着黃龍走的樣子。黃龍道：一眞的走嗎？要是眞的走，我們悄悄的走，還要在天明以前，悄悄的回來。」維城想一想，這話也是對的，要不這樣，嬸娘，翠珍姊，阿興，那一個會不來阻止我們的走路，就說道：「那麼，走西邊的門得了。「當時維城覺得冉也不能有鼠兩端，立即掏摸了身上，又是禿一聲把燈吹熄，從西邊的　裏，兩個人掩到外邊來。一切都順利，晚上沒有風，掩上了的門，不至於被風吹開來；便是那隻黃狗，撑起了兩隻前脚候在籬門口，見維城黃龍都是熟人，只搖了搖尾巴，便　兩人過關。兩人一路在黑暗裏，一脚高一脚低走着，一口氣走了四里路，黃龍在前，還顯得滿不在乎，維城可不成，起先憑了一股勇氣走得不甚吃力，後來就抱怨黃龍走的太快。黃龍這：「不說你走的太慢，倒說我走的太快。走慢了，還要走回來怕來不及。」維城道：「走了再說」</p>
<p>又走了五六里，這還不過走了一半路，維城喘著着笑道：「你別當我是灰心了，我絕對不灰心了，你走你的，你嫌我走得慢，你走了一程，可以在前面等着我。黃龍道：「其實你也是獃子，我也是獃子，只要我奔了去，幫你抬一抬手，白刀子進去，紅刀子出來，我不會殺錯了人，我也不會把沒殺當做殺了，你不信，我可以割一人一個耳朶回來給你看。」維城道：「不要說這話，我們還是走。」兩人又憑藉着捲土重來的勇氣，一走走到了雙橋鎭，也不投王順興去住，經自走到陳國器國芳家的門口。黃龍道：「你在門外站一站，我到了邊，從裏邊開出門來接你進去。」黃龍只一蹲，陳家那樣矮矮的屋，颼一聲，他早已在屋頂上，維城咬一咬嘴脣，靠在門外屏息靜聽着。（二五二）</p>

<h3>Re-discussing Thorough Implementation of Consumption Economy</h3>
<p>Regarding the points where administrative and business organizations should thoroughly implement consumption economy, I have briefly listed and discussed them yesterday. Now, I would like to offer my humble opinions on the consumption economy of social organizations and individuals, to inform the people of our nation.</p>
<p>(1) Limiting the Types of Goods Sold by Consumer Cooperatives: The goods sold by consumer cooperatives should be limited to daily necessities. Consumables such as candy and cigarettes should be prohibited from being sold.</p>
<p>(2) Using Cooperatives to Implement Quota Distribution: Utilizing cooperative organizations to implement quota distribution based on the number of family members and the actual quantity of goods needed by members.</p>
<p>(3) Promoting the Use of Substitute Goods: For goods that are underproduced, promote the use of other goods as substitutes; for goods that are expensive and scarce, promote the use of goods that are cheap and plentiful (e.g., using soy milk instead of milk); reward the invention of substitute methods and promote them.</p>
<p>(4) Limiting the Transportation, Sale, and Manufacture of Luxury Goods: Prohibit the transportation and sale of luxury goods, restrict the manufacture of luxury goods, and plan to transfer the original manpower and resources used in the production of luxury goods to businesses that produce necessities.</p>
<p>(5) Promoting Public Cooperation: Public cooperative businesses such as barbershops, bathhouses, and laundries should be promoted in quantity to reduce general living expenses.</p>
<p>(6) Promoting Public Dining Halls: Reduce small families cooking separately to save manpower and material consumption.</p>
<p>(7) Restricting the Addition of Entertainment Venues and Restaurants, and Their Business Hours: Night business hours, in particular, should end earlier to reduce unnecessary consumption, and the addition of new ones should be strictly limited.</p>
<p>(8) Saving Electricity: Practice getting up early and going to bed early to reduce electricity consumption.</p>
<p>(9) Reducing Socializing: Minimize extravagance in banquets and gifts for weddings, funerals, and celebrations. Banquet and feast expenses should be limited, with a maximum of three to four hundred yuan per table.</p>
<p>(10) Promoting Simple Clothing and Frugal Eating: Conserve fabric and unnecessary fancy clothing, reduce the consumption of food and other foodstuffs. Finally, from the standpoint of this newspaper, we would also like to briefly mention the following points for cultural enterprises, to encourage ourselves and others:</p>
<p>(1) Reducing the Number of Official Gazettes and Publications of Organizations and Groups: Except for necessary official gazettes and publications, they should be reduced as much as possible.</p>
<p>(2) Limiting the Length of Magazines: Various magazines should limit the number of pages to reduce unnecessary length, improve the quality of writing, and reduce the quantity.</p>
<p>(3) Reducing the Length of Newspapers: Adopt a policy of refined editing, extracting the key points of news, removing the unnecessary and retaining the essential, avoiding duplication of news, reducing advertising space, and saving paper and other consumption. (On this point, this newspaper is currently designing according to this standard.)</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The Contradiction of the Soviet Union Combined with England and America - Editorial of Asahi Shimbun, December 19th</h3>
<p>The Greater East Asia War is fused with the European War to establish a new world order. Under the name of upholding democracy, sacrificing other nations, especially Eastern nations, to enrich themselves is a century-old trick of the British and Americans. Against this poisonous Anglo-American worldwide dominance, our Japan-Germany-Italy alliance stands on a moral world view and engages in courageous resistance. Needless to say, this is a decisive life-and-death struggle. Precisely because there is a clear common goal of combat, the alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy can become a solid unity.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that Britain and the United States are obsessed with a world domination based on a utilitarian world view, but it is a great contradiction that even the Soviet Union has joined the allied side.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's world view is diametrically opposed to that of Britain and the United States from any perspective. Therefore, we can only say that due to the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, they united as a temporary measure, but in reality, there is nothing in common to speak of. The Soviet Union and Anglo-American imperialism are fundamentally incompatible. It is a well-known fact that Soviet leaders refer to the British and American leaders as "agents of big capital." Therefore, it is not difficult to imagine that these agents of big capital harbor political, ideological, and even national, as well as latent, hatred and aversion towards the Soviet Union. As a result, the United Nations group, which contains these contradictions, will inevitably develop flaws, and indeed, flaws and cracks have already appeared.</p>
<p>The inconsistencies in combat between the two sides, which are exposed from time to time, stem from mutual distrust and suspicion. As a recent example, on October 4th, Stalin expressed dissatisfaction with Anglo-American aid to the Soviet Union and questioned the Anglo-American opening of a second front. It is worth noting that Anglo-American rhetoric vigorously refuted this question, unintentionally revealing the unpleasantness of their feelings towards the Soviet Union. This suggests that the true intentions of the Anglo-American leadership towards the Soviet Union cannot be concealed. Furthermore, the withdrawal of Cripps from the British War Cabinet at the end of November is also closely related to British-Soviet relations. During February of this year, Britain was repeatedly defeated and overwhelmed, and had no choice but to place the responsibility for prosecuting the war entirely on the Soviet Union. Therefore, Churchill desperately suppressed his inner aversion and brought the pro-Soviet left-wing stalwart Cripps into the cabinet in order to cater to the Soviet Union's intentions as much as possible. However, the manipulation involved is likely to explode at any time. In the recent North African campaign, from Churchill's subjective point of view, he believed that the situation was improving for the British side, and thus his confidence in prosecuting the war has somewhat recovered. As a result, Britain removed its mask and drove away the leftist Cripps. To put it bluntly, Britain has utilized the Soviet Union enough. Not only that, but the Soviet Union has consumed a considerable amount of its strength in the past two years of war against Germany and no longer has the decisive ability to counterattack. Seeing this, they pushed Cripps back to the second line.</p>
<p>Understanding this, we can discern the essence of Britain's relationship with the Soviet Union. How cunning, selfish, and self-serving is Britain's habitual foreign policy.</p>
<p>Secondly, we must be careful of the American and British scheme to alienate Japan and the Soviet Union. As everyone knows, the United States and Britain have consistently used first-rate propaganda to continuously provoke Japan and the Soviet Union, wanting to ignite a fire between the two countries. The United States and Britain have not only used the Soviet Union enough in the war against Germany, but they also want to instigate a Japanese-Soviet conflagration, thereby making the Soviet Union bear a greater sacrifice; this can truly be said to be an extremely cruel ploy.</p>
<p>The attitude and policy of Britain and the United States towards the Soviet Union are as malicious as described above. In the future, due to minor shifts in the situation, the Soviet Union will receive treacherous treatment from Britain and the United States, which goes without saying. It is foolish to talk about treachery with those who do not value good faith. Correctly grasping the true intentions of Britain and the United States is the Soviet Union's top priority.</p>
<h3>Axis Reinforcements Land in North Africa Successively Along the Coast; Allied Forces Launch Offensives on Three Routes, Thwarted by Heavy Attacks from German Air Force</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to comprehensive news from the Tunisian front received here, Axis forces have been landing an average of one thousand troops daily on the Tunisian coast, continuously reinforcing tanks and armored vehicles. Among them, the tank units, which have accumulated rich experience on the Maginot Line, can be considered the most elite. According to a dispatch from the frontline correspondent of the British Broadcasting Corporation, General Eisenhower, the commander-in-chief of the anti-Axis forces, is currently deploying Anderson's British First Army on the left flank, American troops in the center, and Free French forces on the right flank to launch an offensive against the Axis forces. However, this plan seems to have been thwarted as a result of the Axis air force heavily bombing their supply lines.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 23rd (Havas) - According to a Berlin dispatch, naval battles between the Axis and Allied navies are taking place near the eastern coast of Algiers in North Africa. When a squadron of Allied warships was escorting several transport ships towards Bougie, they were spotted by a group of Axis reconnaissance planes. Immediately, more planes were dispatched to drop bombs and submarines fired torpedoes to attack them. A total of two 15,000-ton transport ships were hit, and one British and one American submarine were sunk by our destroyers. In addition, we shot down five British planes and heavily damaged one of their destroyers. Moreover, as of the time of dispatch, the naval battles were still ongoing.</p>
<p>Berlin, 24th (DNB) - The Libyan front remained very quiet yesterday. The vanguard of the British Eighth Army is currently following the Axis forces with extreme caution, advancing slowly. British engineering corps are clearing mines in the desert and along the coast, which are the biggest obstacles to the British advance. On the Tunisian front, a squadron of French cavalry participating in the British and American operations was completely annihilated by German forces at Pont du Fahs. The French suffered the loss of forty warhorses, one hundred killed, and countless captured war materials. German bomber squadrons are currently heavily bombing British supply lines. This week, the Axis air force has sunk a total of 49,000 tons of British and American ships off the coast of Algiers.</p>
<p>Rome, 23rd (Havas) - According to North African news, British troops launched repeated attacks in the Sirt area of Tripolitania yesterday, all of which were repelled. In Tunisia, several teams of British and American troops were annihilated by Italian forces. The Italian and German air forces are effectively coordinated, sparing no effort in bombing railway facilities and transportation centers in Tunisia and eastern Algeria. The port of Bone in Algeria has also been subjected to large-scale bombing.</p>
<p>Rumors that Britain and the United States are using the former Spanish Prime Minister to covet Spanish Morocco in North Africa</p>
<p>Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to well-informed sources here, the American military is rumored to have the intention of supporting former Spanish Communist leader Negrín to covet Spanish Morocco. According to a dispatch from Algiers on the 23rd, the American military has intended to organize international troops with members of the disbanded Spanish Communist Party or Popular Front when American troops invaded French North Africa. Therefore, the tendency of the United States to use communist elements is becoming increasingly apparent.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 24th (Domei) - According to reports from London, American troops have arrived in Gafsa and immediately began work.</p>
<h3>Rumor that Spanish President Franco will visit Portugal to return the visit and discuss future cooperation strategies for the Iberian bloc</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from the Stockholm correspondent in Lisbon, it is rumored that Spanish President Franco will soon visit Portugal to hold talks with Portuguese government leaders. It is said that the purpose of the talks is to discuss future cooperation strategies for the recently established Iberian bloc and exchange opinions.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 24th (Rengo) - "Diário de Notícias" commented yesterday on the visit of Spanish Foreign Minister Jordana to Lisbon, stating that the Spanish-Portuguese bloc has become an important factor in Europe. Spain and Portugal are united for peace and are not intended to oppose anyone. The official government newspaper "Maha" stated that Jordana's visit has furthered the understanding and determination to maintain peace in the Iberian Peninsula. Spain and Portugal currently maintain valuable strength as a preparation for future construction. "Novidades" stated that Portugal's every action is purely for self-defense, and that the country not only opposes the Communist Party but is also prepared to resist anyone who infringes upon Portugal's independence.</p>
<h3>Australian Minister to the Soviet Union departs to assume his new post</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to dispatches from Kuibyshev, Australia's first minister to the Soviet Union, Mr. Slater, departed from Jerusalem on the 23rd to travel to Moscow by plane.</p>

<h3>A Tour of the Forefront in North China (Dialogue) (4)</h3>
<p>Member of the House of Representatives: Kunikatsu Tsugumo Secretary-General of the House of Representatives: Osamu Oki</p>
<p>Translated from the December issue of "Gendai" in Showa 31 (1942)</p>
<p>Soldiers Fighting on the Forefront</p>
<p>Reporter: So, please change the topic here and talk about the situation of the Japanese army at the frontline bases or the forefront positions, what is it like?</p>
<p>Tsugumo: This is the most important thing. I visited the forefront of Yuncheng in Shanxi Province. Mr. Oki, you crossed the Yellow River from Baotou to the forefront of Olteus, right?</p>
<p>Oki: I took a night train in Datong on September 24, wrapped in a blanket, and arrived in Baotou on the 25th. From here, I crossed the Yellow River, and 20 kilometers ahead in the Olteus Plain, the so-called communist army was rampant, and the Japanese army had its first line of defense there. The width of the Yellow River is about 200 meters in this area. Supported by engineers, and with guards following before and after, our group arrived at the location where the frontline troops were stationed. There were only five or six mud-brick houses, surrounded by earthen walls, and it was questionable whether they could keep out the cold. The Japanese soldiers were guarding day and night with guns in such places. Not long before we went to comfort them, bandits had launched a night attack near these earthen walls. The bandits had machine guns and were quite powerful. The Japanese army quickly responded and repelled them, but unfortunately, several soldiers, including a lieutenant, were killed. The soldiers of the same team built their tombstones on the side of the barracks and sincerely prayed for their souls. Because bandits appear and disappear unpredictably in the darkness, they said that they could not let their guard down for even a minute. I had comforted the forefront in Central China in the spring of the year before last, and this time I experienced everything at the forefront again, fully appreciating the hardships of the soldiers, and feeling that the people must express their heartfelt gratitude to them. This is a desolate village, and only a delegation of members of the House of Representatives had crossed the Yellow River to visit it once two or three years ago. Since the incident, it was the first time that the Speaker of the House of Representatives had comforted the forefront in North China and Mengjiang, and especially visited such a desolate place, and the soldiers were very grateful.</p>
<p>Tsugumo: I departed from Datong for Taiyuan at night. Since it wasn't a train with berths, I had to borrow a blanket from the army and spend the night wrapped in it. When we reached the area of Shuozhou, it was just dawn, and the train gradually approached the mountains. Soon, the train rushed forward between mountains of about 10,000 feet high. Looking out the window, there was a fortress on every highest mountain peak, with the Rising Sun flag fluttering on it, and under it stood a soldier holding a gun, protecting the train and the tracks we were riding on in the wind carrying sand. We felt very grateful. Everyone in the group was moved to tears. The frontline I saw was in the southern end of Shanxi Province, near Yuncheng, which is the producing area of Hedong salt. Riding in a freight car along the famous salt pond, it took three hours to cross the rugged Zhongtiao Mountains from Yuncheng. After comforting the troops stationed there, we spent the night there. The next morning, we rode horses through roads that cars could not pass, and after more than an hour, we arrived at the position of the troops stationed in the forefront village on the bank of the Yellow River. At this time, we happened to be in the middle of a battle, with the enemy using machine guns and our side responding with mountain artillery.</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei, concurrently holding the position of President of the Executive Yuan, will broadcast in Tokyo today with the title "Message to the People of Japan"; all radio stations in our country will rebroadcast</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) - From 7:30 PM to 7:50 PM on the 25th, Wang Jingwei, concurrently holding the position of President of the Executive Yuan, will deliver a radio address in Tokyo, translated by Vice Minister Zhou, titled "Message to the People of Japan".

<p>Condolences to Konoe</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - President Wang Jingwei of the National Government, concurrently holding the position of President of the Executive Yuan, has been very busy with banquets since his arrival in Japan. At 10:10 this morning, he specially spared time to visit Duke Fumimaro Konoe, who is hospitalized in the hospital attached to the Imperial University. Duke Konoe has been in the hospital for treatment since mid-October this year, and his condition has been very good. Today, he was dressed in formal attire and first went to the council chamber on the second floor of the Yasuda Auditorium of the Imperial University to wait. Before long, President Wang Jingwei, accompanied by Vice Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Secretary Shimizu of the Ministry of Greater East Asia of Japan, arrived. The two had not seen each other for a long time and were deeply pleased. After exchanging greetings and taking seats, except for Zhou and Shimizu, all others were dismissed and they held a cordial conversation. President Wang Jingwei resolutely left Chongqing on December 22, 1938, to advocate for peace in order to seek the peace and revival of China, while Duke Konoe also issued the Konoe Statement to seek mutual cooperation between China and Japan to build a new order in Greater East Asia. The two had pledged to work for the peace of the two countries. During the conversation, they recalled the past and were filled with emotion. Looking to the future, they were filled with infinite hope. The conversation ended at 10:40. When President Wang Jingwei took his leave, Duke Konoe declined to see him off due to his illness and watched President Wang Jingwei leave by car from the window.</p>
<p>Condolences to Miyazaki</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - Ms. Tsuruko Miyazaki, the widow of the late famous Miyazaki Toten, passed away due to illness on the 23rd. President Wang Jingwei of the National Government, concurrently holding the position of President of the Executive Yuan, had a long-standing friendship with Mr. Miyazaki, so he sent Foreign Minister Chu as his representative today to pay condolences at the Miyazaki residence and present a generous condolence gift. After the Russo-Japanese War, Mr. Miyazaki assisted National Father Sun Yat-sen and revolutionary martyrs Huang Xing and others in establishing the headquarters of the Chinese Revolutionary Alliance in Tokyo. At that time, he became comrades with President Wang Jingwei.</p>
<h3>Japanese Foreign Minister and Minister of Greater East Asia Host Banquet for President Wang Jingwei, Exchange Views on General Issues After Banquet</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - A dinner party jointly hosted by the Japanese Foreign Minister and the Minister of Greater East Asia to bid farewell to President Wang Jingwei, concurrently holding the position of President of the Executive Yuan, was held at the official residence of the Foreign Minister in Kojimachi tonight. The guests of honor were President Wang Jingwei, Foreign Minister Chu, Finance Minister Zhou, Chairman Xiao of the Military Advisory Council, Minister of Industry Mei, and Minister of Propaganda Lin. The accompanying guests were Ambassador Xu Liang and counselors of the embassy, Ambassador Shigemitsu to China, Counselor Nakamura, advisors Ishiwatari, Matsui, and Teraoka of the National Government, Director-General Matsudaira, General Abe, and special envoys Hiruma, Arita, and Nagai who visited the National Government, Ambassador Hidaka to Italy, and Director Okumura of the Information Bureau. During the dinner, Foreign Minister Tani gave a welcoming speech first and raised a glass to the health of President Wang Jingwei and his entourage. President Wang Jingwei then gave a reply, expressing China's firm determination to advance together with its ally Japan in the spirit of sharing life and death. After the banquet, they exchanged views on general issues in another room. The welcoming speech of Foreign Minister Tani and the reply of President Wang Jingwei are recorded below:</p>
<p>Welcoming Speech by Foreign Minister Tani</p>
<p>In his welcoming speech, Foreign Minister Tani recalled that it has been four years since President Wang Jingwei advocated for the peace movement, and it has also been over two years since the signing of the Basic Relations Treaty between China and Japan. During this time, the internal and external situations have been extremely difficult, but under the leadership of President Wang Jingwei, the National Government has laid the foundation for revival, and all constructions are progressing rapidly. We have always admired President Wang Jingwei's efforts. After Japan declared war on Britain and the United States on December 8 last year, President Wang Jingwei further expressed his determination to share weal and woe with Japan. In May of this year, he specially dispatched Special Envoy Chu and his entourage to visit our country to seek close cooperation. Japan also sent Special Envoys Hiruma, Arita, and Nagai to China to return the visit. Today, the cooperation between China and Japan has reached a perfect state, which is truly cause for celebration. However, the cooperation between the two countries is not only for temporary interests, but, as stated in the Basic Relations Treaty between China and Japan, it is based on the common ideal of building a new order and has the characteristics of spiritual unity. Now the war has entered its second year in the midst of successive victories, and Japan has decided to exert all its strength to complete this unprecedented war. This can be told to our ally. Furthermore, President Wang Jingwei's visit to our country this time has strengthened our determination to fight.</p>
<p>President Wang Jingwei's Reply</p>
<p>President Wang Jingwei replied as follows: Since I and my colleagues in the National Government arrived in Tokyo, we have been delighted to meet Foreign Minister Tani and Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki, and it is difficult to express in words. Tonight, we are even more honored to be invited to a banquet. Your Excellency Tani is highly talented and highly respected. I had the honor of seeing you more than ten years ago. Today, I am overjoyed to meet you again and to hear about your great ambitions and far-reaching insights on the world situation and the East Asian situation. I am filled with admiration. Your Excellency Minister Aoki has worked in Nanjing for more than two years and has spared no effort in seeking the realization of Greater East Asian co-prosperity through Chinese-Japanese cooperation. He has a wealth of knowledge and makes precise observations of the current situation in our country. He is able to discern all advantages and disadvantages. It is truly gratifying for patriots in both countries that he has been appointed to the important position of Minister of Greater East Asia to implement his plans. Today's situation, as stated by Prime Minister Tojo yesterday, is a historically defining era for the world. Internally, it instructs the East Asian nations to advance as East Asian comrades in the construction of co-prosperity, and externally, it responds to the myriad changes in the world with an unchanging East Asian axis, overcoming the shackles of Britain and the United States for a hundred years and promoting the moral spirit of the East for thousands of years. It is truly joyful and encouraging that Your Excellencies Tani and Aoki are assuming important responsibilities in this great era to complete this great mission. In the past four years, I have been running around for peace and deeply feel that the word peace does not mean passive appeasement, but rather the active establishment of a foundation for friendship between China and Japan. Therefore, based on my country's National Father Sun Yat-sen's Greater Asianism, I responded to your country's advocacy of building a new order in East Asia. Since your country launched the Greater East Asia War, the National Government immediately declared its determination to share weal and woe, which is based on the above-mentioned meaning and further engages in a struggle of sharing security and sharing life and death. However, I am deeply concerned that my efforts are limited and will not be of much help. This visit has given me the opportunity to have sincere talks with officials, and I have received encouragement and assistance. In addition to being grateful, I can only rely on my efforts and work harder to live up to expectations. With this intention, I would like to use the host's glass to wish Your Excellencies Tani and Aoki good health and to wish for the increase of friendship between our two countries and the success of the construction of Greater East Asian co-prosperity.</p>

<h3>National Government Adjusts Military Structure; Ministry of Army and Navy Reassigned to Military Commission, Personally Commanded by Chairman Wang</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government, with the spirit of sharing weal and woe, has been exerting its full strength in all aspects to cooperate with Japan in order to complete the Greater East Asia War. As a result, the relationship between China and Japan has become even closer. In order to cope with the current situation and strive to strengthen its military power, the National Government authorities have successively adjusted the central military structure and reassigned the Ministry of Army and Navy, which were subordinate to the administration, directly under the jurisdiction of the Military Commission. Chairman Wang will personally command them in order to unify the army's organization, equipment, and training. The government also plans to retrain the reorganized troops in various regions. It is expected that the fundamental policy of the National Government in reorganizing the army in the future will be: (1) to massively equip the army with military supplies and weapons; (2) to implement the principle of elite troops to reorganize the army; (3) to strengthen the local military and police forces; (4) to increase military pay; (5) to establish military spirit; (6) to establish military administration; and (7) to establish a foundation for military expenditure. Among them, the preparation of military supplies and weapons will be actively carried out in the future in order to exert the strength of the National Government's army. At the same time, the reorganization of the army will also adopt the principle of elite troops, resolutely reorganize personnel, and eliminate the old warlord characteristics. In order to respond to the construction of a new China, the government will begin to form new and sharp troops. Therefore, military pay will inevitably be increased. Once the military spirit is injected, the National Government's military construction will surely make a leap forward. The establishment of local security has become increasingly important among the important issues of the National Government today. Therefore, strengthening the local military and police forces is an urgent task at present. Therefore, it will also be rapidly carried out in the near future. The specific implementation methods are expected to increase the number of local armed police and security teams, and retrain and reorganize the troops in order to consolidate local security and ensure that military and political forces can be integrated internally and externally to vigorously expand the peaceful areas. Therefore, under this Greater East Asia War, the strengthening of the National Government's military power is quite promising in cooperating with the Greater East Asia War.</p>

<h3>British Deeply Fear German Attack on Gibraltar; Rumor That Axis Forces Have Shifted Target from Eastern Front to Southwestern Europe</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Swedish Capital, 24th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch) - According to Swedish newspapers citing London news, the British fear of a German attack on Gibraltar is increasing. The London correspondent of "Swedish Evening News" said that the movements of neutral European countries have become the focus of British discussion. According to British news, the border blockade between Fascist countries and Switzerland has lasted for several days, which is enough to prove that German forces have concentrated considerable military strength there. London's "Daily Mail" said that the Axis powers have shifted their joint military strength from the Eastern Front to Southwestern Europe. Germany's target is Gibraltar, no longer Stalingrad.</p>
<p>Macau Correspondence</p>
<h3>Eating and Loans; Students Appeal to Public Opinion; Hoping for Fairness and Simplicity</h3>
<p>Last time I briefly reported on the inside story of inland student loans. Here is another letter from a student appealing to the public. I have specially excerpted it below:</p>
<p>"Today there is only one class in the afternoon on the timetable. What good deeds can I do? Most of my classmates have gone to class. The dormitory is deserted and I can't find anyone to chat with. This kind of dead air is enough to suffocate people.</p>
<p>My eyes occasionally fell on the bright words "Thirteen" hanging on the wall - such an unpleasant and ominous day - which startled me deeply. The meal fees I paid are only enough for two days of meals. What should I do? If I don't think of a way immediately, I may be in danger of starvation the day after tomorrow. The letter I wrote to my brother for help half a month ago has not yet been answered. I don't know whether the loan I applied for a long time ago will be approved. Old Xu seemed to have a registered letter yesterday. If the money is remitted, I can make do with it. Old Li has a lot of money, but he is reluctant to lend it to others. It is better not to be snubbed. Old Wang's money has already been borrowed by those who were quicker. There is no way to think of it from him. It is just the beginning of the semester and I am already poor. How can I get through this semester?</p>
<p>I lay blankly on the bed. The verdant pine trees outside the window sighed softly with the breeze. The milky sky leaking through the gaps in the branches always looked so mournful. The early ripe peaches of the South that I picked in the wild suburbs the day before yesterday also looked very haggard. A few decaying dead petals fell weakly on the table. I whistled softly, trying to drive away this oppressive air. But the shadows of "meal fees" and "eating"... were reflected even more strongly and clearly in my mind.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the door was pushed open and Old Xu walked in, looking very unhappy:</p>
<p>"It's too unreasonable!"</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" I asked, sitting up from the bed.</p>
<p>"The results of the loan review have been announced. Damn it, I'm still just self-funded B!"</p>
<p>"What about me? What about me? Did you see it?"</p>
<p>"You are self-funded A?"</p>
<p>A ray of light swept back into my eyes. Meal fees and eating problems were all solved. After all, there is no way out. Everything in the room seemed to be smiling at me. All the cells in my body suddenly felt an unusual ease and joy, making my body seem to have endless heat. I stood up happily and really wanted to laugh heartily.</p>
<p>But when I saw Xu Jun's cold face, I thought I should comfort this disappointed friend.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter! Self-funded B is also good. There are still those who have not been approved!"</p>
<p>"Hmph! I don't know what the loan committee is based on to review. Li ×× is actually a war zone A."</p>
<p>"What? He is war zone A? Isn't he very well-off? Yesterday I saw him stewing meat in the dormitory. This morning he was still boasting about his leather shoes that cost one hundred yuan a pair. Why can he get a war zone student loan?"</p>
<p>"Don't you know? His loan applicant is the dean! At this time, everything is a "face issue." The dean applies on his behalf, so there is no reason not to approve it." He said angrily.</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"The loan committee is based on whether there is a certificate of poverty and the "face" of your applicant to review. But the more truly poor you are, the harder it is to get a certificate of poverty. I don't have a popular person in the county government in my hometown. I still can't get this certificate of poverty today. I have submitted two or three petitions, but no one pays attention to you! When the loan was about to be verified, I asked Huang, the squadron leader of our dormitory, to be the applicant. I meant that because he was relatively close to us, the school would certainly believe that he could know our real situation. Who knew that he had no "face" in the school, so I got a self-funded B. Those who asked professors to apply were at least self-funded A. As for the dean, his "face" is even bigger, so of course he got a war zone loan."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"Damn it! Based on this suit of clothes, see if I should be approved for type A."</p>
<p>People are somewhat selfish and self-interested. Although I heard so many of his unfair complaints, I was still secretly rejoicing that my personal problem was solved. I unconsciously said:</p>
<p>"Who cares, I don't have to worry about my eating problem the day after tomorrow!"...</p>
<p>"Don't be happy, this is just approval. The day to issue money is still far away!"</p>
<p>"What?!"</p>
<p>"The school has to submit the list of approved loan students to the Ministry of Education. The Ministry of Education will approve the amount of our monthly meal fees, and then the money will be sent down from Chongqing. It will take at least two months."</p>
<p>"You received a registered letter yesterday. Can you lend me some money? I won't have any food to eat the day after tomorrow!"</p>
<p>"I'm also worried. What came yesterday was a package."</p>
<p>I was stunned. This time I was plunged into the deep pool of cold water again.</p>

<p>Preparing to Ration Cooking Oil Based on Population</p>
<p>A Central News Agency reporter learned from the wholesale department yesterday that the department's method of rationing and selling cooking oil is still effective. However, in order to prevent citizens from hoarding, selling for profit, and cooking oil stores from deducting sales, the department has decided to implement a method of rationing cooking oil based on population in the future and is currently preparing for it. The previous regulation of selling oil based on house donation tickets was abolished because it was feared that it would cause major malpractices. At the same time, according to the person in charge of the department, the source of cooking oil in the city has recently become increasingly abundant. The amount of oil shipped from Dalian and other places to Shanghai is estimated to be tens of thousands of dan.</p>

<h3>New Valuation of Real Estate in Public Concession Temporarily Not Implemented</h3>
<p>The Information Office of the Public Works Department announced that the bureau had previously set up a committee to investigate tax inequality. The report made by the committee, which was resolved by a majority of members, was sent by the bureau to the annual meeting of foreign taxpayers on April 17 of last year for approval. The bureau, in accordance with the annual meeting resolution, considered the implementation of the recommendations in the report. Although the real estate located in the Public Concession has been revalued, the bureau, in view of the current situation, has no intention of implementing this new valuation for the time being.</p>
<h3>Reader Forum</h3>
<p>In general, political, economic, social, cultural, and educational issues related to people's lives should be of deep concern to the authorities, and the most reasonable policy guidelines should be formulated accordingly. At the same time, the authorities must also be able to accept the continuous contributions of opinions from the people and make revisions to adapt to the environment. This newspaper takes the standpoint of the people and fulfills its responsibility to public opinion, and naturally takes it as its responsibility to communicate the opinions between the authorities and the people. Therefore, we have opened a reader forum to publicly introduce the good-faith and truthful opinions of the people. We hope that readers will pay attention and that a small reward will be given for any contributions that are published.</p>
<h3>The Crisis in Shanghai's Education Sector</h3>
<p>— Jiang Feng</p>
<p>Shanghai, as the largest city in the country, holds a pivotal position in the development of education at all levels, from primary to tertiary. Although the sheer number of institutions might lead to uneven quality, their efforts in nurturing talent and elevating culture are largely commendable. In recent years, amid turbulent times and global unrest, the sounds of learning have scarcely ceased in Shanghai. This is partly due to the local authorities' dedicated support, and partly due to the education personnel's strenuous self-reliance. However, as living conditions become increasingly difficult, I deeply feel that the future of education is fraught with difficulties. In essence, these can be summarized into four points:</p>
<p>1.  The Drastic Increase in Educational Expenses: Shanghai is teeming with schools, with public schools in the minority and private schools accounting for the majority. Private schools, when registering, were originally required to establish a designated fund. However, most only went through the motions to satisfy formalities and lacked actual funds. Those with assets were often controlled by individuals, leading to numerous disputes. Others may have possessed real estate, but could not utilize it since the war, thus increasing their burden. As a result, all expenses depend heavily on tuition fees. Consequently, tuition fees have repeatedly increased. At the primary level, tuition commonly reaches one hundred or even one hundred fifty to sixty yuan per semester. At the secondary level, it ranges from one hundred several tens to two hundred several tens yuan. Universities charge over three hundred yuan. And this does not include the cost of books and stationery, which can easily amount to fifty to sixty yuan for primary school, over one hundred yuan for secondary school, and even several hundred yuan for university students. Furthermore, some schools have the bizarre practice of charging separately for examination paper. For students whose schools are far from home, transportation and meal expenses are not even factored in. While the affluent may not find these costs significant, how will the impoverished cope?</p>
<p>2.  The Emptiness of Educational Facilities: Modern education cannot simply rely on teachers to fulfill their duties by lecturing from textbooks and notes. This is particularly true for secondary schools and universities, where reference books and experimental equipment and materials are essential. Since the war, however, most schools have lost their original library facilities. Any supplementation has been minimal. Newly established schools are even more devoid of resources. It is true that schools face financial difficulties, but some officials may be using this as an excuse to enrich themselves privately. In the past year, the cost of experimental materials has risen even higher, leading some laboratories to close down. Teachers struggle with the inconvenience of finding supporting materials, and students find it even more difficult to understand the lessons. Among young people, diligent learners can still catch a glimpse of the subject matter, while mediocre ones can simply go through the motions. The cost of education is rising daily, while the standards are declining. Is this not a cause for concern?</p>
<p>3.  The Chaos in the Education System: China's education system had just begun to take shape before the war, though not yet perfect, it was fixed and systematic. In recent years, however, malpractice has become a cause for concern. First, there is no standard for selecting subjects, with secondary schools either emphasizing science over humanities or discarding history and geography. Universities often cancel required courses due to low enrollment, arbitrarily substituting them with other classes. All of these are clearly wrong. Second, the flexibility of time affects work schedules, with class hours and term start and end dates being freely adjusted, often giving rise to a suspicion of cutting corners. In the past, schools traditionally closed during extreme cold and heat to allow for rest and relaxation, which was scheduled at a fixed time. Now, summer school has become commonplace, with some schools dividing the year into three terms and holding classes in the summer as usual. While school authorities can collect more tuition fees and generate additional revenue, teachers and students end up attending classes in the sweltering heat, engaging in futile talk. Third, the auditing of academic records has lost its basis. In recent years, some schools that fail to self-regulate either indiscriminately enroll students, allowing them to skip grades, or sell fake diplomas, allowing them to advance in their studies. This is the biggest problem in Shanghai's education sector today.</p>
<p>4.  The Poverty of Educational Personnel: Before the war, private university teachers could earn two to three hundred yuan per month, secondary school teachers one to two hundred yuan, and primary school teachers at least thirty to forty yuan. Today, prices have increased by approximately twenty times or more, with rice prices exceeding even that multiple. Moreover, rice, which was once an insignificant expense, now accounts for half of the household budget. Yet, teachers' salaries have increased by only four to five times at most, and sometimes less than three times compared to pre-war levels. Most teachers come from humble backgrounds. Only a few female teachers without family responsibilities can barely make ends meet. Ordinary teachers use their savings accumulated from hard work to make up for the shortfall, but this cannot be sustained for long. Selling or pawning possessions is ultimately limited. As a result, they must cut costs in every possible way, even to the point of malnutrition and avoiding medical treatment. On the other hand, they must take on more work to make ends meet. It is common for university teachers to teach up to thirty hours, secondary school teachers forty hours, and primary school teachers to tutor in two or three private homes. Despite such strenuous labor, their income often falls short of half of their expenses. They may feel relatively satisfied at the beginning of a semester, but by the end, they are far from making ends meet. Furthermore, one's energy is limited. Rushing about, speaking until hoarse, erudite scholars can barely cope, while mediocre ones inevitably cut corners. Even worse, they may be used in areas where they lack expertise, resulting in wasted effort. How can we expect to improve the quality of education?</p>
<p>The above are all very serious symptoms in Shanghai's education sector. Thorough reform will not be easy. However, if such a situation is not remedied urgently, Shanghai's education may not only go bankrupt but also lose its effectiveness. In recent days, various public opinions have repeatedly discussed this issue, but specific solutions do not seem comprehensive. I now propose a few more points below:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding Improving Teachers' Remuneration</p>
<p>(A) Increase the Amount of Various Rations: The difficulties faced by teachers stem from the insufficient quantity of rations such as rice, flour, oil, and sugar. This shortage disproportionately affects teachers whose monthly salaries are fixed and have barely increased. They must either supplement their rations through the black market, which is costly, or, since teachers and their families cannot easily purchase goods themselves, they are often unable to afford domestic help. Therefore, until rations can universally meet everyone's needs, subsidies should be provided to teachers based on the number of their direct relatives who live with them and are unemployed. The amount of subsidies for primary, secondary, and university teachers may be differentiated. University teachers, with their higher qualifications and smaller numbers, can be given slightly more preferential treatment, while subsidies for primary school teachers, who are more numerous, can be slightly reduced. Those who teach at multiple schools, as well as couples who are both teachers, should not receive multiple rations. Those who already receive additional allowances at schools such as those run by the Municipal Council should also be subject to separate restrictions. The methods of supervision and other details should be determined separately. However, teachers should still pay the officially set price for rations, so that teachers do not starve and the authorities are not burdened excessively.</p>
<p>(B) Reduce Tuition Fees for Teachers' Children: Teachers live a meager life, and there is a risk that their children may not be able to attend school. Following the example of doctors providing free medical care to their relatives, all schools should offer half-price or free tuition for teachers' children. This is a method of mutual assistance within the education sector, and I hope that schools will take the initiative to implement it as soon as possible!</p>
<p>(2) Regarding Subsidizing and Enhancing Facilities</p>
<p>(A) Various books, especially textbooks, should be fully equipped. The authorities should encourage bookstores to offer special discounts to schools that purchase books.</p>
<p>(B) Schools should also be urged to make full use of existing equipment and instruments. For deficiencies, efforts should be made to have merchants offer special discounts. The same should be done for needed materials. If the cost of water, electricity, and gas can be reduced, it would be particularly beneficial, so that schools do not have to grope in the dark during classes in the morning and evening, and that experiments are not just nominal but actually meaningful. In addition, if jointly used laboratories can be set up in different districts and borrowed in rotation, it would be even more beneficial to scientific education.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding Rectifying the Education System</p>
<p>Shanghai's educational administration has been neglected for a long time and urgently needs rectification. The focus of rectification should be on the management of curriculum, academic records, and other items. First, everything should be run entirely by Chinese personnel to avoid misunderstandings. Second, it should be handled by formal institutions, but must be promoted by qualified personnel with appropriate qualifications.</p>
<p>If these measures can be implemented, tuition fees will not increase excessively with rising prices. The quality of facilities can be improved. Teachers' lives will also be stabilized. It is hoped that all relevant authorities and responsible personnel from various schools can cooperate to achieve the desired results, so that Shanghai's education will not only overcome the difficulties but also regain its former glory!</p>

<p>In order to ensure a steady supply of sugar to the Shanghai market, the Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office, in addition to allocating sugar according to market demand, has submitted a proposal to the authorities to implement sugar distribution based on population, to popularize sugar distribution and prevent merchants from profiting. The implementation will be announced after approval, and a pilot program is planned to be launched in Nanshi first. After achieving results, it will be extended to the entire city. The sugar distribution plan will be based on the population registered in each district's baojia (neighborhood watch) system.</p>
<p>Important Notice for Carrying Sugar</p>
<p>Before the population-based sugar distribution is implemented, temporary measures will be used to issue sugar based on housing tax receipts and household registration. These temporary measures have been improved as much as possible to prevent fraud. Anyone holding a housing tax receipt to purchase sugar must bring their citizen identification card with matching address. At the same time, police stations in each district have instructed police officers to pay attention to anyone carrying four or more small packages of sugar and must check their housing tax receipts before allowing them to pass, in order to prevent merchants from reselling for profit.</p>
<p>Supervise Sales</p>
<p>The sugar will be sold by Category A retailers that have been registered and approved. In the Public and French Concessions, sugar will be distributed based on housing tax receipts and citizen identification cards, while in Zhabei and West Shanghai, it will be distributed based on household registration. To strictly supervise and prevent fraud, supervisors and inspectors have been ordered to closely monitor the process. Supervisors will be stationed at retailers issuing sugar based on housing tax receipts to supervise sales. Inspectors will review all relevant books and records of retailers issuing sugar based on citizen identification cards after the sales. For industries that require special allocations of sugar, checks will be made at any time to ensure that the sugar is used entirely for business purposes. If any fraudulent activity is discovered, the allocation will be suspended and the matter will be investigated.</p>
<h3>District Court Procuratorate Installs Reporting Bell</h3>
<p>The Shanghai District Court Procuratorate has specially installed a reporting bell to effectively protect the legal rights of the people and implement verbal complaints. Rules for public use have been established and approved by the Ministry of Judicial Administration and will be implemented. The implementation measures are detailed below.</p>
<p>Installation</p>
<p>The installation of the reporting bell is intended to facilitate verbal complaints by the public, with the aim of redressing grievances. The regulations stipulate that it applies to criminal cases in which someone wishes to make a verbal complaint or surrender themselves to the authorities. The bell is installed at the front of the court and is managed by the judicial police on duty at the gate. The chief prosecutor of the procuratorate has strictly warned all judicial police not to make things difficult for people, so as not to defeat the purpose of the bell.</p>
<p>Ringing the Bell</p>
<p>Any citizen wishing to make a verbal complaint, report an offense, or surrender themselves should ring the bell and wait quietly at the bell-ringing location under the direction of the judicial police on duty. The judicial police will lead them into the courtroom and they must not leave without permission. The duty prosecutor on call should immediately go to the courtroom with a clerk to conduct the hearing. The clerk will take detailed notes. However, all complainants or informants must not make false accusations based on personal grudges. Once investigated, they will be punished according to the law.</p>
<p>Rules</p>
<p>There are a total of nine rules regarding the use of the reporting bell, which have been submitted by the court procuratorate and approved by the Ministry of Judicial Administration and will be implemented from today. Yesterday, the procuratorate issued a notice to inform the public and published the rules for using the reporting bell, which are posted at the front of the court for public viewing.</p>

<h3>Save on Christmas Expenses, Donate Funds for Poverty Relief</h3>
<p>Readers of this newspaper have launched a fundraising campaign to raise 100,000 yuan for poverty relief. People from all walks of life have responded enthusiastically. Today is Christmas and the anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising. It is hoped that all 200,000 Christians in Shanghai will uphold the "spirit of Jesus's universal love and mutual assistance," cease all inappropriate spending, and save a portion of their expenses on food, sweets, and entertainment to donate to this newspaper's poverty relief fund. Mr. Gan Dounan sent a letter donating 1,000 yuan in the name of the Li Yu Changcheng Brand Hot Water Bottle Factory to help the poor and sick in society. The remaining balance of the poverty relief fund is 4,697 yuan. Mr. Pu Qiting also donated two books of meal tickets. Gu Shangqin, an unemployed teacher, wrote that he has been unable to find work in Shanghai and is relying on his mother's employment as a domestic worker to survive. He asks readers for help.</p>
<h3>Passing Through Chinese Territory Iron Gates at Night</h3>
<p>Only Need to Show ID. The French Concession curfew has been lifted. Regarding the iron gates and Laobeimen (Old North Gate) bordering Chinese territory, etc., they are now open all night. Pedestrians only need to show their curfew passes to pass through. Now that the curfew in the French Concession has been lifted, in the future, they only need to show their identity card, residence permit, or citizen identification card to pass through.</p>
<h3>Police Department Issues Notice to All Lianbao: Prepare for Fire Drills; Each Household to Prepare a Bucket of Water and Yellow Sand; Storefronts Should Hang Warning Signs</h3>
<p>The police departments in each district of the Public Concession recently issued a notice to the lianbao (joint security organizations) in their respective districts, instructing them to notify their subordinate baojia (neighborhood watch) to comply with the following matters: 1. Each household must set up a bucket of tap water, a bucket of yellow sand, and other fire prevention materials. 2. Each storefront must set up a wooden board 5 inches wide and 15 inches high with white characters on a black background. One side should read "Air Raid Alert" and the other side should read "Warning Alert." 3. Each lianbao should conduct two or three fire prevention and rescue drills in the near future and report the organization and equipment of each class under its jurisdiction to the baojia department of each police department. The highest authorities will suddenly conduct a fire drill at a certain time, and all bao and classes under each lianbao must be fully prepared at all times. The lianbao chiefs should forward these points to their subordinate bao, classes, squads, and residents and ensure that they comply with them.</p>
<h3>Municipal Police Bureau to Implement Second Salary Increase</h3>
<p>Recently, prices have soared, and the livelihoods of public servants have become increasingly difficult. In order to stabilize the lives of public servants, the central government has decided to implement a second salary increase to meet current living needs. The Municipal Police Bureau has received the order and has instructed all subordinate branches, the Detective Corps, and the Water Patrol to submit the second salary increase list within a limited time for review. Failure to do so will be considered as voluntarily giving up the increase.</p>
<h3>Central Reserve Bank to Reduce Remittance Rates for Shanghai Remittances, Effective from the 28th of This Month; Remittances to Hankou and Ningbo Limited to 5,000 Yuan per Household</h3>
<p>In order to facilitate the transfer of funds to and from various regions, the Central Reserve Bank, after careful study, plans to reduce the remittance rates for remittances from Shanghai to various regions uniformly and to charge the lowest possible handling fee for remittances to Shanghai from various regions, regardless of the amount, so as to smooth the flow of funds. It is reported that this measure is scheduled to be implemented from the 28th of this month, and the banks in this city have all expressed their support, which will greatly benefit the development of the financial sector.</p>
<p>Limits on Remittances to Various Regions</p>
<p>Since the relevant authorities in this port have strictly cracked down on speculation and various investment transactions, idle funds can no longer continue to wreak havoc. Therefore, those with idle funds have sought other ways to transfer cash to the interior and purchase agricultural products in an attempt to hoard and profit, leading to a sharp rise in prices in the interior. Seeing this situation, the authorities in this city have formulated measures to restrict remittances to various regions, stipulating that remittances to the interior (referring to the peaceful areas) should not exceed a certain amount. Large remittances must specify their purpose. The scope of remittances is limited to remittances for the purchase of agricultural products in the peaceful areas, although not restricted, but the remitters are limited to purchasing merchants. The Central Reserve Bank has set a limit of 5,000 yuan per household for remittances to Hankou and Ningbo. The total daily remittance to branches and offices in Anqing and other places along the Yangtze River downstream is limited to 100,000 yuan. After the limit is exceeded, acceptance will be stopped. However, the above limits are temporary. If the hoarding trend in the interior subsides, the restrictions will be lifted.</p>
<h3>Fire Trucks in Urban Areas Given Fuel Allocation</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the source of gasoline for this city has been interrupted. In order to effectively reduce fuel consumption, the authorities have cracked down on fuel in this city, and all public and private vehicles in the city have been restricted, which has also caused problems with fuel for fire trucks in urban areas, causing vehicles to stall. Considering that fire trucks are crucial to the security of urban areas, relevant authorities have repeatedly discussed the matter and a resolution has been reached to allocate fuel separately. Therefore, the threat to the fuel for fire trucks in urban areas has been lifted.</p>
<h3>Urban Tax Rates to be Adjusted Next Year</h3>
<p>Recently, the cost of living for urban residents has soared, commercial profits are high, and municipal expenditures are huge, resulting in a significant revenue shortfall. In order to meet the needs of urban revenue and expenditure, the Municipal Finance Bureau will thoroughly adjust the existing tax rates based on the actual situation. It is reported that the tax rate principle has been determined and is currently being discussed with relevant departments. The new tax rates will be implemented from the 30th fiscal year (next year).</p>
<h3>Report on Scholarship Fund</h3>
<p>Recently, the scholarship fund of this newspaper has been generously supported by people from all walks of life, benefiting many needy people. Yesterday, Mr. Pan Ziyi transferred 500 yuan originally intended for his wife, Ms. Pan Qu, to the scholarship fund as a merit, benefiting his friends and family. Wang Zhizuo donated 100 yuan, San Yuan donated 35 yuan, Wei Bo donated 30 yuan, Liu Zichang, Sun Shoupeng, and Liu Ziping jointly donated 30 yuan, and Shanghai New Middle School donated 20 yuan.

<h3>Shanghai Rural Area Party Office Promotes Various Tasks</h3>
<p>Since the Chinese Kuomintang Shanghai Rural Area Party Office moved to Pudong to work, although it has only been forty days, under the leadership of Deputy Directors Ling Xianjiao and Li Wenxi and Wen Huanzhi, all party workers have actively promoted the party affairs, civil movements, and coordinated propaganda work in various districts of Shanghai where ruralization is being implemented for the first time. The division of district branches has now been completed. A total of 39 district branches have been established, including 17 in Nanhui District, 12 in Fengxian District, and 10 in Beiqiao District. The district executive committee members have been selected and appointed.</p>
<h3>Milk Prices to Increase Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council issued Announcement No. 618, stating that the maximum selling price of fresh milk sold in the Public Concession has been separately stipulated and will be implemented by the Bureau from the 26th: (A.T.T.) grade: 9 yuan and 3 jiao per quart, 4 yuan and 7 jiao per pint, 2 yuan and 4 jiao and 5 fen per half-pint, A grade: 8 yuan and 5 jiao, 4 yuan and 5 jiao, 1 yuan and 3 jiao and 5 fen, B grade: 7 yuan and 9 jiao, 4 yuan, 2 yuan and 1 jiao.</p>
<p>(Note) The price of cream is not subject to price control.</p>
<h3>Arrested Traffickers of Military Weapons</h3>
<p>Li Yinmin, a Chinese detective of the Criminal Division of the Public Concession Police, detectives Peng Bingsheng, Yang Zhong, and others recently learned that someone was holding military weapons with the intention of selling them. They ordered officers to contact these people at 1212 Lubin Road on the previous day. At that time, they showed two Mauser pistols and eight bullets and asked for 10,000 yuan. The detectives arrested five weapon traffickers including Xia Yuezheng, Shao Dinghua, Xia Linpei, Xia Qingzhang, and Liang, along with the pistols and bullets, and brought them to the police station. Xia Yuezheng confessed that the weapons were stolen from the home of Zhu Quantong, the chief of the Third Lianbao in the Jing'an Temple area at 18 Lane 1400, Avenue Edouard VII, because his wife, Shen Luying, worked for Zhu as a domestic servant and stole them when she had the opportunity. The detectives also arrested Shen Luying and sent her to the First Special Court yesterday. Because further investigation is needed, the court ordered her to be detained pending further review.</p>

<h3>The Vigorous Situation of Chinese Stocks Before the Holiday - Business as Usual on January 5th</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trading situation for Chinese merchant stocks marked the final day of the year's transactions. The market will be closed for the New Year holiday starting today and will resume trading on January 5th. The general trend of selling to obtain cash has subsided, and the previously tight monetary conditions have eased, boosting investor activity. Wealthy investors are particularly determined to identify and acquire targets, leading to a more robust situation. For example, in the newly listed stock of the Sino-French Pharmacy, part of the "New One Industry," prices soared to $29.50. The Xinyi Pharmacy reached $260. However, the Minyi Pharmacy's method of increasing capital through subscription triggered selling pressure. The "Little Three Yuan" stocks uniquely reached the $70 mark, and Kang Yuan Canned Goods hit a high of $52.50. Among financial stocks, the China &amp; South Sea Bank saw transactions at $140, with fewer subsequent deals. In the utilities sector, Shanghai Electric Power and Zhabei Water &amp; Electricity each rose by $1.50. In the department store sector, Wing On rose to $34, and both Sincere and China Emporium each rose by over $2. The Lai Wah Company saw transactions reaching as high as $332.50. In the textile industry, Wing On Textile Factory rose by $35, and the Dasheng No. 1 and No. 3 factories also stopped falling and stabilized. Small denomination stocks such as the Great China reached $10.75. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco rose by $5. In the cultural sector, only World Book Company rose by $2.50, while Commercial Press and Chung Hwa Book Co. declined with significant trading volume.</p>

<h3>Monetary Conditions Have Eased - Joint Reserve Notes Rise Another Five Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Money Exchange Association's overnight interbank lending rate suddenly dropped to a low of 2.2 cents, indicating an easing of monetary conditions, it is said.</p>
<p>Japanese military scrip remained stagnant. Interbank trading was priced at $5.5525, with silver firms and small money shops selling at $5.56 and buying back at $5.545. Joint Reserve Notes rose another five cents. Dealers sold at $4.15 and bought back at $4.10, it is said.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai jewelry industry's Daxin firm listed the retail price of gold ornaments at $3,050 per tael, unchanged. (Buying back reduced by about $300). The informal market among firms initially appeared sluggish but suddenly strengthened at noon. The morning low was $2,700, followed by $2,780, slightly decreasing to $2,760. Around noon, a certain firm's buying spree caused a sudden rise, with $2,800 difficult to obtain, a $20 or $40 difference compared to the previous day. Trading volume was sparse. The listed price of sycee silver ornaments remained at $16 per tael, with interbank trading around $17.</p>
<h3>100 Member Banks - 48 New Members</h3>
<p>Recently, the establishment of new banks in Shanghai has been exceptionally vigorous. As a result, the number of member banks in the Banking Association has increased from 54 last year to 100. In addition to the original 52 banks (excluding the China Farmers Bank and Jiangsu Farmers Bank), the following 48 banks have joined as new members: Darlai, Sichuan Trust, Tongyuan, Dakang, Chongqing, Qiantai, Shanghai-Asia West, Zhongyong, Jiading, Hetai, Dagong, Anhua, Zhongmao, Guangzhong, Huamao, Shanghai Iron Industry, Yongfeng, Zhongya, Shangye, Huiyuan, Limin, Xintai, Jianghai, Daya, Guoxin, Yongtai, Great Wall, Shanghai Industrial, Daxin, China Fisheries, Guofu, Nanyang, China Tobacco, Dayuan, Weiye, Shanghai Industrial and Commercial, Futong, Jiangsu Local, Shanghai Industrial, Wuzhou, Guanyi, Fuhua, Shanghai Yarn Industry, China Industrial, Jiu'an, China Yushang, Lianyi Jiuchang, Dazhong, and 24 others.</p>
<h3>Public Bonds Trading Opens for Types C and E</h3>
<p>There was very little trading in the gray market for Unified Public Bonds. Only Type C was traded at $54.50 and $54, and Type E at $52, with transactions of several tens of thousands. The closing price was down by $0.06 to $0.08. No other types were traded, it is said.</p>
<h3>Peach Blossom Lady Cloth - Spot Goods Exceed Factory Orders</h3>
<p>The factory market sentiment is stable with minimal fluctuations. Yesterday, the opening price for 12-pound Globe shirting was $193.25, later rising to $193.50, with no one selling. The same weight of Fugui Dapeng fluctuated around $193, with only small amounts of wholesale transactions. The factory order for Peach Blossom Lady cloth was at a minimum price of $312 in the morning, closing at $314 in the afternoon, with the later market even trading at $314.50. Spot goods, however, have already exceeded factory orders, increasing by $1 to $1.50. Chicken Muslin also requires a price of $214.</p>
<p>East cloth also turned upwards yesterday. The bank order for 12-pound Dragon Head shirting rose from $198.25 to $199.25, an increase of $0.075. The factory order for the new Dragon Head, however, remained sluggish as before, closing at $197.75 in the afternoon. Rainbow Ball was at $198.25, and Flying Fish and Yangji were quoted at $197.75. The red order for Four Gentlemen serge rose from $7.66 to $7.72. Bank orders were particularly strong, reaching as high as $7.87.</p>
<h3>Expensive Woolen Goods Selling Poorly</h3>
<p>Due to a shortage of available capital, the prices of woolen goods are difficult to recover. Yesterday, Yin Feng's No. 1 camel-colored cashmere was sold at 100 yuan per yard, yuan-colored breeches cloth at 250 yuan, gray at 225 yuan, straight-sale cloth at 240 yuan, China Yuanfeng navy blue valencia at 210 yuan, Yuanfeng Flying Horse suit cloth at 145 yuan, Three White Edge Zigong at 375 yuan, Chia He No. 29 Hailing club cloth at 200 yuan, No. 55 medium-thick tweed at 140 yuan, Meifa palis at 165 yuan, and Meifeng overcoat cloth at 370 yuan. Transactions were relatively sparse because the end of the year is approaching, and all firms want to close their books. Furthermore, shipping documents are difficult to obtain, and actual sales are limited, so most owners are unwilling to sell.</p>
<h3>Coarse Grains Remain Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the supply and demand of coarse grains in the market were relatively balanced, and market sentiment remained stable. Transactions included 20 bags of Chongming red sand at $355, over 40 bags of Wujiang selected green beans without bags at $306, and substandard goods at $290. One truckload of Fertilizer Bean Cake was priced at $81.50, and three truckloads of Yuanlong Bean Cake were priced at $81 to $81.50.</p>
<h3>Superior Dangyuan Osmanthus Eyes Are More Popular</h3>
<p>Osmanthus eyes have been available in the market for several days. The market price of miscellaneous-grade Yuanxing is around $4, without much fluctuation. However, because Dangyuan Dasanyuan is in limited quantity and the goods are of better quality, its asking price is more than 20% higher than $4, making it very firm.</p>
<h3>Orchid Rice Arrivals Are Scarce</h3>
<p>Recently, the arrival of orchid rice has been limited, and the cost is also high. It is understood that only a few dozen boxes have arrived this time, and the quality and color are good. However, because the asking price is relatively high, no transactions have been made yet. The market sentiment is stable.</p>
<h3>The Market for Rebar is Stagnant</h3>
<p>The local Shanghai construction industry has long had no appetite for rebar, and merchants from the north road in Tianjin and Yantai are also inactive. Therefore, the entire market situation is stagnant. However, the inventory in Yichang is low, and those holding goods have not lowered prices due to poor sales, and prices remain very firm. Yesterday's market saw 40-foot standard-grade rebar of 3-4 points of various colors selling for $11,000 per ton. 5-inch to 1-inch goods were sold for $10,500 per ton, and 3-foot starter goods were priced at $7,500 to $8,000 per ton, depending on the specification.</p>
<h3>High-End Cigarettes Continue to Soar</h3>
<p>Cigarette sales are balanced, with prices fluctuating. British American Tobacco was at $9,350, Old Knife at $8,400, Pin Hai at $8,000, Fairy at $7,800, Wuhua at $6,350, Japanese cigarettes Golden Gun at $1,850, Golden Deer at $3,200, Red Rose at $2,500, Quanlu at $2,950, Nian Zhi at $2,900, Compass at $2,350, national cigarettes Pyramid at $6,400, and Beauty at $5,750. The selling prices of high-end goods, however, continue to soar. 50-piece Egret were at $28,500, Dananwei at $16,000, Great Five at $25,000, Big Stage at $13,500, and Little Cannon at $8,500, all per 10,000 cigarettes, an increase of $1,000 to $2,000 compared to previous prices.</p>

<p>Random Thoughts</p>
<h3>Jesus and Cai E</h3>
<p>— Jian Nong</p>
<p>Thinking back to this day more than 1,940 years ago, Jesus, the light of the world and the gospel for mankind, was born in a secluded and humble manger in Bethlehem, Judea, barely sheltered from the cold wind. Do you truly not believe he is the light of the world and the gospel for mankind? Please consider how his profound words illuminated this dark world and comforted suffering humanity!</p>
<p>When he sat on the mountain and first openly taught the masses, he proclaimed, completely contrary to common sense: "Blessed are the poor in spirit... Blessed are those who mourn... Blessed are the meek... Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness... Blessed are the merciful... Blessed are the pure in heart... Blessed are the peacemakers... Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness!" The vast crowd, upon hearing these peculiar and unexpected words, were initially stunned and bewildered, then frowned and expressed doubt, before finally being convinced and enlightened. Then, a breath of relief emerged from their long-suffering hearts; a faint smile appeared on their long-suffering faces; and when they looked around and ahead, it no longer seemed so dark, so terrifyingly dark! Each of them then roused themselves and found the courage to walk the path of life. I also hope that all of us today, as we commemorate the birth of Jesus, will deeply contemplate those profound words that can enlighten and comfort us.</p>
<p>Cai E's spirit and demeanor were of course different from those of Jesus. However, when he was the Governor of Yunnan, the military and civilians were grateful and wanted to donate money to cast a bronze statue and build a living shrine for him, he instead took the money and distributed it to the starving people, saying: "...The wailing masses can live countless lives by eating this small amount of charity: Promoting a person's merits is not as good as saving lives." - According to Chen Yizhe's "New Sayings of the Woods" - this compassionate and chivalrous spirit is also worthy of our admiration and emulation! How many starving and freezing people are in Shanghai today, awaiting urgent relief! Is there anyone who can emulate Cai Songpo's benevolence? I deeply pray for this on this day commemorating the Yunnan Uprising. (In response to the donation of winter clothing).</p>
<h3>A Brief History of Party Newspapers Before the 1911 Revolution</h3>
<p>— Shi</p>
<p>During the 1911 Revolution, popular movements surged across the country, responding enthusiastically, which was the result of the tireless efforts of revolutionary newspapers at that time to advocate and encourage. At that time, the Qing government initially promoted newspapers for reform because it was humiliated by foreign powers. After the Wuxu Coup, Empress Dowager Cixi was attacked by domestic public opinion, and she became angry and severely cracked down on newspapers and suppressed public opinion in an effort to cut off revolutionary movement. On August 24th of the 24th year of Guangxu (1898), the publication of newspapers in Tianjin, Shanghai, Hankou and other places was prohibited, and the main people were strictly searched and arrested. However, this proposition did not take effect. Generally, people with lofty ideals were not tempted by profit or threatened by power, and still held a full of enthusiasm and strived for the revolution.</p>
<p>The Earliest Revolutionary Newspaper - China Daily First Voice</p>
<p>The earliest newspaper to advocate revolution was the China Daily, published in Hong Kong in the 25th year of Guangxu (1899). It was hosted by Chen Shaobai, sent by Premier Sun Yat-sen in Hong Kong. It advocated nationalism and advocated opposition to the Qing Dynasty. Its most important text was "The Future of Democracy and Chinese Political Revolution." The succession of newspapers that were established were the Su Daily, the National Daily, the Alarm Bell Daily, the Guangdong Daily, the Yousuowei Daily, the Juvenile Daily, the Minhu Daily, the Minwang Daily, the Minli Daily, the Tianduo Daily, the Fubao Daily, the Minbao Daily, and the New China of the 20th Century, etc.: As for the Guangdong Daily, the Yousuowei Daily, and the Juvenile Daily, etc., their arguments were more moderate than the China Daily, and they were not pure propaganda newspapers like the China Daily. Among them, the Su Daily case, which caused a sensation for literary inquisition and had the most impact, was the Su Daily case. The Su Daily was founded in the summer of the 23rd year of Guangxu (1897), first operated by Hu Tiemei, but his Japanese wife, Ikoma Etsu, was responsible for coming forward and registered with the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai. Later, Chen Fan invested in the purchase. He was a native of Hengshan, Hunan, and was removed from his position as Magistrate of Jiangxi due to a church case. He hated the corruption of the officialdom and wanted to awaken the Chinese people through public opinion. Among them, Zhang Xian belonged to the Constitutionalist Party, but later saw that Kang Liangzhongzhang was not thorough, so he changed to the revolutionary faction.</p>
<p>The writers for the Su Daily included Wu Zhihui, Zhang Taiyan, Cai Yuanpei, Zou Rong, Xu Xilin, and Qiu Jin, who were most noticed by the Qing government. In the 29th year of Guangxu (1903), Zou Rong, a native of Sichuan, organized the Patriotic Society and published the book Revolutionary Army, which was heartbroken and determined to overthrow the Manchu Qing as its mission. Zhang Taiyan wrote a preface and explained the contents of the book in the new book introduction column of the Su Daily. The Qing government was furious and arrested Zou Zhang and others in the Shanghai Concession and demanded extradition, but the authorities in the boundary refused. After unsuccessful negotiations, it only organized an extra public hall for joint trial, sentencing Zou Rong to two years of imprisonment and Zhang Taiyan to three years of imprisonment. Zou Rong later died in prison. Zhang Taiyan was released from prison on June 27th of the 32nd year of Guangxu (1906) and went to Tokyo.</p>
<p>The people in the Su Daily were not discouraged by this. In June of the same year, they initiated the founding of the National Daily, with the supplement "Dark World," edited by Su Heng (Mu Qin), sparing no effort in attacking the bureaucrats. The Qing government, considering the difficulty of negotiations in the concession, issued an order strictly prohibiting merchants and civilians along the Yangtze River from subscribing, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a document to the General Postal Affairs Department to inform the post office not to deliver the National Daily, but at that time the post office was just emerging, and most of the newspapers were delivered by private letters, so the Qing government still could not achieve its goal.</p>
<p>The Minbao issued a lion's roar with the momentum of precious paper in Luoyang</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Tongmenghui, in order to promote the spirit of racial revolution and publicize the true meaning of the Three Principles of the People, Premier Sun Yat-sen founded the Fubao and the Minbao in Tokyo between the 31st and 32nd years of Guangxu. The Fubao was edited by Liu Shuaipei, and the Minbao was first edited by Zhang Ji, and his opinions were extremely fierce, and the main purpose and political program were published in Chinese and English in the most prominent position in the newspaper: (1) Overthrow the current bad government: (2) Land nationalization: (3) Leave the world truly at peace; (4) Build a republican government; (5) Request all countries to approve China's revolutionary new undertaking. Premier Sun Yat-sen had already proclaimed the Three Principles of the People, nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood, in the inaugural speech of the Minbao, in which there was such an elaboration:</p>
<p>"I think that the evolution of Europe and the United States is based on three major principles: nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood. The death of Rome is because the principle of nationalism dominates the country, and the authority is tyrannical. If those below are not suffering, the principle of democracy will rise. In the 18th century in the Americas, and at the beginning of the 19th century, despotism was overthrown and the republican government was established. The world is civilized, human intelligence is increasing, and material purchases are booming. The century is sharper than a thousand years. Economic problems follow political problems, and the principle of people's livelihood is eager to move. The 20th century must be the era of the promotion of the principle of people's livelihood."</p>
<p>In addition, the outstanding articles in the Minbao were the National Theory of Nationalism, "China's Constitution Must Be Revolutionary" and the novel "Lion's Roar". After Zhang Taiyan arrived in Tokyo, he edited it, which was very popular among those who followed it and internationally, with the momentum of precious paper in Luoyang.</p>
<p>Yu Boxun (Youren) of the other faction of the Restoration Society wrote books to oppose the Manchus, which was extremely fierce. During the heyday of the Minbao in Tokyo, he went from Shaanxi Province to Shanghai and, together with Wang Shoucen and other core figures in the Bingzhong Party, organized the Shenzhou Daily. Later, he founded the Minhu Daily, the Minyu Daily, and the Minli Daily. Song Jiaoren, under the pseudonym "Fisherman," published brilliant articles in the Minli Daily, striving to promote revolutionary ideas. All the discussions were based on academic principles, which could repeatedly explain the corruption of the Qing government and awaken the people's sense of responsibility for national affairs, which was most welcomed by the intellectual class at home and abroad.</p>
<p>The Minli Daily is brilliant and occupies the top spot among party newspapers at that time</p>
<p>These three newspapers were born one after another, and under the pressure of autocratic power, their fates were extremely short-lived. The Minhu Daily was founded in the spring of the first year of Xuantong (1909), specializing in attacking the corruption of the officialdom. The authorities took the opportunity to destroy it, and Yu went to Japan. The newspaper was published for only 39 days. In the autumn of the same year, Tan Shanwu continued to run the Minyu Daily, changed its arguments and devoted itself to attacking Japan. The Japanese Consul General in Shanghai requested Shanghai to seal it, and it was only published for 42 days. On September 9th of the following year, the Minli Daily appeared with a fearless attitude. The writers for the newspaper included Song Jiaoren, Lv Zhiyi, Wang Yinze, Zhang Xingyan, and Tan Hongkun, etc., advocating an urgent and practical attitude. It could sell more than 20,000 copies every day, and the printing press worked day and night, occupying the top spot among the party newspapers at that time.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Republic of China, it had the reputation of "three vertical and three horizontal principles of the people". The three vertical principles of the people are the Minhu, Minyu, and Minli, and the three horizontal principles of the people were the Minquan founded by Dai Tianchou (Chuanxian), the National News founded by Lv Zhongyi, and the China Minbao founded by Deng Jiazhi. The three horizontal principles of the people were radical in their arguments and more emotional, so the Minli Daily still occupied the top spot. Later, Yu ran for national affairs, and the newspaper business was entrusted to others to handle, and the arguments changed, and the sales also decreased. The only one that remained was the Shenzhou Daily.</p>
<p>After Kang Youwei went to Japan, Premier Sun Yat-sen also rushed from London. The revolutionary people in Japan all hoped that Sun and Kang could join hands and work together on a large scale, but Premier Sun Yat-sen was a revolutionary party that advocated democracy, while Kang Youwei was a constitutionalist monarchist party. In the end, the two factions separated and became more and more distant due to the fundamental incompatibility of monarchism and democracy. The Constitutionalist Party took the New People's Journal, which was hosted by Liang Qichao, as its base, and the Revolutionary Party took the Minbao, which was hosted by Zhang Ji and Zhang Taiyan, as its base. The two sides formally debated democratic constitutionalism, and as a result of the struggle, the Constitutionalist Party failed. The central argument that the Constitutionalist Party's newspaper officially promoted was constitutional monarchy; however, the Qing government's pseudo-constitutional movement prepared to destroy constitutionalism under the name of constitutionalism, thus causing the Constitutionalist Party to lose its position.</p>
<h3>Sharing Weal and Woe</h3>
<p>— He Jiazhi</p>
<p>A Branch of the Song of Courtyard Flowers after the Year End</p>
<p>Huang Long was looking forward to Wei Cheng uttering these words, saying; "Who said we're not going? Let's go!" Encouraged by Huang Long, and with Huang Long as a companion, Wei Cheng truly meant what he said: let's go! He stood up, leading the way for Huang Long. Huang Long said: "Are we really going? If we're really going, we'll go quietly, and come back quietly before dawn." Wei Cheng thought for a moment, this made sense. Otherwise, Aunt, Sister Cuizhen, A Xing, who wouldn't stop us from leaving? So he said: "Then, let's go through the west door." At that moment, Wei Cheng felt that he couldn't be indecisive any longer. He immediately reached into his pocket, and with a "puff" he blew out the lamp. From the west entrance, the two of them sneaked outside. Everything went smoothly. There was no wind at night, so the closed door wouldn't be blown open. Even the yellow dog, propping itself up on its two front paws at the wicker gate, recognized Wei Cheng and Huang Long as acquaintances, and just wagged its tail, letting the two of them pass. The two walked along in the darkness, one foot high, one foot low. They walked four miles in one breath. Huang Long, in front, still seemed carefree. Wei Cheng couldn't keep up. At first, relying on a surge of courage, he didn't find it too difficult, but later he complained that Huang Long was walking too fast. Huang Long said: "Instead of saying you're walking too slowly, you say I'm walking too fast. If we walk too slowly, we'll have to come back and be afraid we won't make it in time." Wei Cheng said: "Let's just keep walking."</p>
<p>They walked another five or six miles, which was still only half the way. Wei Cheng gasped and laughed: "Don't think I've lost heart. I absolutely haven't lost heart. You go your way. If you think I'm walking too slowly, you can walk ahead for a while and wait for me up there. Huang Long said: "Actually, you're a fool, and I'm a fool too. As long as I rush over there, I can help you raise your hand. White blade in, red blade out. I won't kill the wrong person, and I won't mistake someone I didn't kill for someone I did kill. If you don't believe me, I can cut off one ear from each person and bring it back for you to see." Wei Cheng said: "Don't say that. Let's just keep walking." The two, relying on their courage to come back again, walked all the way to Shuangqiao Town. They didn't check into Wang Shunxing's place, but went straight to the entrance of Chen Guoqi and Guofang's house. Huang Long said: "You stand outside for a moment. I'll go over there, open the door from the inside, and let you in." Huang Long just squatted down, and over the Chen family's low, low house, with a "whoosh" he was already on the roof. Wei Cheng bit his lip and leaned against the door, holding his breath and listening carefully. (252)</p>
