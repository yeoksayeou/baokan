<p>本報特稿</p>
<h3>阿刺伯的古與今（五）</h3>
<p>兩個朝代</p>
<p>穆氏死後，阿刺伯的政治宗敎軍事領導權，就傳給了他的大弟子們。這些承繼人，稱日喀立法（先知的代表人）而不稱為先知。第一任喀立法是穆氏的岳丈，名阿布貝克。第二任喀立法，是穆氏的得意弟子，名阿瑪爾。第三任喀立法，是麥加城中的阿瑪的族人，名日阿脫曼。第四喀立法，是穆氏的女婿，名日阿里。他們都以麥地那為首都，就在他們的領導之下，回敎國的勢力向外擴張，而同時存在的羅馬人和波斯人鬥爭</p>
<p>就在個喀立法的組織領導之下，阿刺伯人克服了各地，成立了一個偉大的阿刺伯帝國。六三五年取得了叙里亞，六三八年取得了巴力斯坦，其後取得了小亞細亞的山區阿美尼亞，六四六年進入埃及，六四九年取得居伯魯島，其後更在北非洲沿岸向西推進，由埃及而脫里波里（即今里比亞），而突尼斯，而亞爾日爾，而摩洛哥，把北非的巴比爾人，摩爾人，一起拉入回敎的懷抱。七二年更渡過直布　陀海峽，到了西班牙半島，掃蕩了西哥德人的部落王國，由此一直北們幾乎要到法蘭西的大平原了。　向東推進，則於六三七年進入美索不還米亞，六五〇年整部克服了新波斯王國。這樣當穆氏百年祭的時候，（七三一年）這個阿刺伯大帝國，竟東起印度河邊，西到大西洋岸，南極阿刺伯海，東到小亞細亞了。在這個大帝國中，阿刺伯的人，不消說掌有了一切軍權政權。可是他們對於宗敎的信仰，却比較寬容，一任人民自動接受。事實上，人民自動接受回敎的，日見其多。這與一般歷史上傳說，穆氏一手持刀，一手執古　經以强迫傳敎的說法，正是相反。</p>
<p>第五任喀立法，另標了一個新朝的名字，不單稱喀立法，不遵守選任的成規，却要以父于相傳的新例，來專有喀立法的尊號了。這一任喀立法，稱為阿瑪耶朝，首部也從麥地那遷到了叙事亞的大馬斯革。這一個喀立法新朝，子孫相傳，約經過近一百年之久，（六六—七四九）乃又發生了革命。而巨大的回敎帝國，就開始分裂了。就在這分裂的回敎帝國中，東方中亞細亞上的突厥民族，乃以潛移勢力的過程，起代阿刺伯人，領導了回教的運動。而阿刺伯民族的光芒，就漸漸地消失了。</p>
<p>革命發生於西元七五〇年，是年有个穆氏近埃，名阿拔斯族者之裔孫某，起而推翻即一百年來把持喀立法權之阿瑪耶朝，而另建一個新朝——喀立　阿拔斯朝——首都又從大馬斯革，遷到了底格里斯下游的報達城。這樣一來，阿刺伯帝國的重心，偏向於東方，一切生活習俗，也漸漸地東方化了。這個新朝系統中，最有名的喀立法，就是那與歐洲法蘭克王查理曼大帝同時的哈倫。在哈倫統治帝國時候，阿刺伯人的文治武功，都非常光明。</p>
<p>可惜這一個新　的建立，實行起了阿刺伯帝國的大分裂。即被推翻的阿　耶家，由大馬斯革出亡，通過了北非洲，逃到西班牙半島，受摩雨人的擁護，於九二九年自　喀立法，以阿爾陀伐為首都，領有西班牙半島。那在埃及一族的阿刺伯人名曰法提瑪族，於　元九六九年（這一族是穆氏的婿家）自稱喀立法，以開羅為首都，領有北非全部。這樣，阿刺伯帝國，分成了三個中心，各相仇視，而各自努力。這三個中心，後來都不　維持局　的統一。在各個的領域中，都紛起了地方的小酋長。譬如阿拔斯朝喀立法的領域中，就山塞爾核突厥人，起來得勢。阿刺伯人是在那裏走下山路了。阿拔斯朝於一二五八年全滅，法提瑪朝於一五一七年全滅，而西班牙半島上的阿瑪耶朝，則於十四世紀時，也為西班牙北部約卡斯成爾王國所滅了。</p>

<h3>考試的準備（三）</h3>
<p>— 胡祖蔭</p>
<p>保持身體上和心理上的健康　這一點似乎是老生常談，但是投考者往往未曾做到。「急難抱佛脚」的入們，常是日以繼夜地攻讀，結果弄得睡眠不足，頭暈腦脹；到正式投考的一天，反而精神萎靡，甚至生病不能應考。而平時已有充分準備的人們，到考試前一二天，反能優遊自得，休養身體，準備應付常前的考試。所以投考者應該在事先充分準備，俾可在臨考前，能有適當的休養，充分的睡眠，而在身體的各方面呈現安適的狀態。</p>
<p>還有一點，就是要保持心理上的健康。有些人對於所要投考的科目確會早日充分準備；對於身體方面，亦能保持健康。但是在心理方面，却有深切的憂慮和恐懼。他們憂懼不能錄取，他們甚至抱有一種「卑劣感」，以為自己總是不如別人，這次考試總是不能錄取。这種「卑劣感」有時確能使投考者失去自信心，因而對於可以解答的問題遲疑不決，或不敢自信地寫上答案，當然就要影響到考試的成續。所以在考試前，非但要保持我們身體上的健康，也要注意到在心理上應有良好自信的態度。</p>
<p>臨考時的注意</p>
<p>投考人在考試前有了充分的和適當的準備以後，即可在指定考試的日期，帶着相當的自信能力去應考。但在臨考時，還有下列四件應該注意的事項，也是投考者所不應忽略的</p>
<p>認淸題目　考試時，如不能認淸題目，往往答非所問，勞而無功·投考者應先將全部題目烏瞰地看一遍，注意有無不了解的地方和完全不能解答的題目。烏瞰地閱過一遍以後，再將每個題目仔細地研究一下。有些題目要詳答，有些可略述。有些題目包括二部或　部有些題目要舉例說明。確定了題目的性質和含義以後，即可進行寫作。</p>
<p>開始寫作　明瞭題目以後，有些投考者常要坐在位子上，默對着卷子出神。他們希望腦海中能够興起一種「烟士披里純」的作用，而能產生「夢筆生花」的效果。這種「夢想一的態度是不對的，因為」方面可以耗去寳貴的考試時間，他方面也可影響考試時的努力。</p>
<p>所以在認淸了題目以後，即應在腦海中構成適當的答案，答案構成以後，即宜開始寫作，根據心理學的研究，腦力的活動常隨身體上筋肉的活動而發達，在寫作時，因為手部筋肉的活動，可以引起腦力的活動。我們在寫作時，常有許多好的意思自然地流露出來就是這個緣故。所以當我們寫作時，就如蠶吐絲一般繼續不斷。有時，在寫答第一問題目時，忽然想到解答第二問題或第三題目的良好意思，這時，可將寫答的工作暫停一下，而將這寳貴的意思記在有關題目的旁邊，以免遺忘。</p>
<p>支配時間　在解答題目時要注意共有多少題目，共有多少時間而後加以適當的支配，相當難易的題目，可以支配同量的時間。特別難的題目，當然要多留一些時間去解答。假如考卷上未曾規定要照題目的次序解答，則可先做容易的題目，而將難答的題目留在最後，俾可有充分的時間去思索答案，而不致影響其他題目的解答。</p>
<p>保持自信心　前節已提到，在考試前不宜憂慮，恐懼。在臨考時，更宜保持自信心，很鎭靜地應考。假如投考者能保持一種積極的態度，自信對於考試有成功的希望，常能有助於思想的發展和答案的完成。有了堅强的自信心，即可從容寫作，思潮亦可源源而至，而理解力，判斷力亦可增進，對於考試的成功也可認為是意料中的事了。（完）</p>

<h3>主婦必備的條件</h3>
<p>— 雲</p>
<p>因為一個主婦掌理一家的事務，她在家庭中的地位是十分重要的，「女人萬歲」一書的作者芬尼赫斯德會經說：「你敎育一個男子，你只敎育了一個人，你敎育一個女子，你敎育了全家的人。」</p>
<p>近年以來，許多國家對於女子結婚的準備，都很注意，並在學校裹面，特設家政科。敎授縫紉，烹飪，家庭組織兒童心理，消費問題，家庭陳設，食物與營養，和家庭管理等科，而一般人都認為要成為一個成功的主婦，必須具備左列的性格：</p>
<p>一，個人衛生：因為家庭衛生，必須從個人做起，如果主婦自己沒有衛生常識，那末決談不到家庭全體的衛生。</p>
<p>二，整潔外貌：這並不是指穿得富麗堂皇，只須要整潔，所以這並不關涉經濟問題。</p>
<p>三，創造精神：一個主婦必須對於新的治家方法，有創造的精神，勇於改進，並不墨守舊規。</p>
<p>四，前進志願：無論過去或目前的地位如何，必須具立前進的志願，然後方能有進步。</p>
<p>五，優美品性：她必須有優美的品性，使人歡迎，這一點包括良好的態度，姿勢等。</p>
<p>六，高尙道德：她必須具備高尙的道德，可以使別人尊敬，而作為子女的模範。</p>
<p>做一個主婦，實在不是一件容易的事，已經做主婦的女子，就可以自豪了。</p>
<h3>怎樣養育嬰孩</h3>
<p>— 瑛英</p>
<p>養育　孩是一件似易而　　工作，做母親的，對於自己的嬰孩，若養育得法，嬰防就　健康的生長，滯則嬰孩或致發育不完全，或致半途夭折，這是必需注意。</p>
<p>談到育兒法，第一件自然是哺乳嬰孩最好的食糧是母親的乳汁，一個母親，非有特別的事故，應自已哺乳，切不可雇用乳母，或使用牛乳。有許多婦人，用牛乳哺乳嬰兒，這很不妥的，稍有經騐的母親與護士等，皆知道嬰孩單食牛乳，不能生長，我們不妨將牛乳和人乳比較一下，就可瞭然了。</p>
<p>（甲）人乳呈中性反應，牛乳僅呈酸性。</p>
<p>（乙）人乳不含細菌，牛乳含無數細菌。</p>
<p>（丙）人乳的成分，若以百分比計算，含有脂肪三。三，蛋自質〇·七，乾酪素〇·八，乳糖七·〇，而牛乳含脂肪三·五，蛋白質〇·七，乾酷素二·八，乳糖五·〇。</p>
<p>無疑，人乳與牛乳的差異簽遠，普通把牛乳用稀水調和，以哺乳嬰孩，這委實不能作為生理上正當的嬰孩食品。</p>
<p>原來母乳所含的成分，適合於嬰孩的消化，無過厚和積滯之息，世間沒有比母乳更精美健康。至於哺乳的方法，須有一定的時間，健康母哺乳嬰孩，每次哺乳後，須經二小時以上，其胃內方始空虛，而在空虛以後，胃臟復須有相當的休息，故嬰孩每次哺乳的間隔，至少以三小时時為度，即如每日午前六時，九時，十二時，午後三時，六時，九時各哺一次，共哺六次夜間休息，如是一二月後，嬰孩哺乳量漸次增加，可將哺乳次數，自六次减至五次，每次間隔四小時，例如午前六時，十時，午後二時，六時，十時各哺一次，日間哺乳，若嬰孩正在熟睡，應把他喚醒，但在夜間，可仟嬰孩睡眠。每天哺乳时間，通常不得超過十五分鐘，依抨量法而知健常的哺乳婴孩，在哺乳之首先，八至十分鐘内，至少已被得其需要乳量四分之三，其後五分鐘內，再吸得其餘四分之一，每次哺乳後，宜將乳頭，乳暈用棉紗或棉花拭凈，而覆以淸潔的布片，若欲使乳頭光潤並防止皸裂，可於乳頭上塗擦礦脂，羊毛脂等少許，至下次哺乳時，用溫開水洗去。</p>
<p>至若嬰孩的哺乳期間，最好須哺至十個月，一年以後，母親的乳汁，不但不够嬰孩的食糧，且也失去滋補的功效，故須立即斷乳，不過斷乳宜徐徐實現，不可卒然斷去，以防哺乳嬰孩发生病變，倘若母亲已怀胎，那就必須斷乳，因為母親的乳汁，不够腹內外的嬰孩之用。</p>
<p>以上所說，是關於母親哺乳的方法，倘若母親萬不得已，自己不能親自給嬰孩哺乳，而必需雇用乳母時，則對於乳母的選擇，應十分留心。即就母親個人便利而論，雇用乳母，也多煩擾的地方，未景之前，須為之檢騐身體，旣雇之後，又須查考嬰孩哺乳　的適當與否。</p>
<p>乳母的體格和血液，須先經過警生的檢驗，如證明合格，方可雇用·因為乳母的乳汁，往往不適於嬰孩，若乳母染有梅毒性的疾病，更是危險，所以若不加以檢騐，隨便雇來哺乳，教有客於嬰孩的健康·還有一事應須注意，乳母所產的嬰，月份要與自已的嬰孩差不多，要是相差過遠，乳什於嬰孩也不甚適宜。</p>
<p>至若喂牛乳的，則必須留意其清潔，所喂的成分，也須依照嬰孩的月份，而漸次增加、使用練乳來代牛乳，普通有三種：（甲）含有乳酷而加糖質者，（乙）含有乳酷而未加糖質者，丙乳酷已除去者，究竟其成分也好像牛乳一般，並且無一種可稱完全適當的食品，以個養六個月這下的嬰孩，至以六個月以上，首先二種可做嬰兒一部份的食品（乳酷撤去的仍不適宜），奶　對於六個月以下的嬰孩，實不易消化粉食，勉强哺乳，很易致疾。據醫家的實騐證明，七個月以後的嬰孩，始可用粉食　育，還有羊乳，也是嬰孩很好的營養品，而且羊不會患肺興奮劑病，這一點更比牛乳有益。</p>
<p>其次談一談嬰孩的補助食物，四五個月後的嬰孩，在哺乳之外，每日還須給他喂一些菜子汁，如橘子汁之類。這種菓子汁，應用開水冲服，榨橘子的時候，手要洗得淸潔，勿使沾汚，至若嬰孩在六七個月後，就可以加一點食物給他吃，嬰孩的食物，須知柔嫩而容易消化者，且應烹煮至爛熱，才可給他吃，嬰孩的菜蔬，以菠菜蘿葡番薯和捲心菜為最佳。但是這種菜蔬，烹調時不可放油，只須放一些鹽便可，十個月的嬰孩，則每天可以給他一次稀薄的粥，還有麵食也可以的。</p>
<p>此外，對於養育嬰孩，必須注意的。如嬰孩應有充分的睡眠，最好使嬰孩自已睡，才不致被攪擾。又嬰孩必須每日洗浴，被衣和尿布等物，也須時時洗換，才能保守淸潔，按時權衡嬰孩的體重，也是必要的。因為體重的增加與否，和嬰孩的健康，很有關係。尤為重要的，是勿使嬰孩和病人接近，因為嬰孩體質甚弱，容易感染疾病、</p>
<p>以上種種，都是做母親的，必不可不留心的。總之，一個母親，要養育嬰孩，若能依照上面的方法做去，對於嬰孩身體的健康，一定是很有裨益的。</p>
<h3>夏日養心</h3>
<p>— 靜</p>
<p>養心修身本來是一件很好的事，在夏季更來得適宜，俗語說一心定自然凉」那末為什麼不從事養心的工作呢，下面是關於養心的格言：</p>
<p>心有定理，則不眩於邪妄雜說，心有定識，則不撓於鄙俗淺見。</p>
<p>心莫淺狹，心淺狹，招盡許多尤悔。心莫因循，心一因循，誤盡許多英雄。</p>
<p>人心貴小，心小則天下去得，人心要空，心空則天下包得。</p>
<p>聖人之心，正大光明，賢人之心，嚴肅惕厲，衆人之心，卑陋淺狹，小人之心，奸詐巧變。</p>
<p>恭敬謙讓四字，是有心之善，即於此見眞性。狎侮傲慢四字，是有心之惡，即於此昧天良。</p>
<p>人人都用心，只怕用在邪處，人人都造心，只怕造起惡境。</p>
<p>心似平原走馬，放則易而收則難。</p>
<p>心即是神，欺心者無不欺神。神即是心，欺神者無不欺</p>
<p>心虛能應天下之事，心公能服天下之人，心正能屈天下之物，心明能達天下之理。</p>
<p>此心一冷則熱鬧之景不能入。此心一淡，則豔冶之物不能動。</p>
<p>人心怕昏，錯宜以靜澄神，神定則漸覺精明。</p>
<p>人心要有城池，心有城池則不出。人口要有門戶，口有門戶則不縱。</p>
<p>少年之心，宜多牧歙，不宜豪放。老人之心，宜多豪放，不宜謬抑。</p>
<h3>家事一得</h3>
<p>菜刀去銹：浸入泔水缸内，一二日取出，其锈自去。</p>
<p>補鑊：鑊子内洞，若以生猪肝搗爛塗之，與鐵補無異。</p>
<p>粥：自米煮粥時，二加以檸檬汁一匙，可使色成純白，氣味香烈。</p>
<p>白飯：炊米時也可放入檸檬汁少許於水中，則米色又潔白且鬆軟。</p>
<p>冷飯：夏日以生莧菜或新荷葉舖冷飯上，則隔宿也不致發餿。</p>
<p>滌玻瓶：蛋殼可勿遺棄，碎之成片，用以滌盪玻璃瓶，無須剔抉之勞，而能括垢磨光。</p>

<h3>事業成功的基礎</h3>
<p>— 飄萍</p>
<p>小朋友！你們現在還正是讀書的時假，將來長大了，一定要到社會上來做番事業，做事業需要很好的學問和道德做基礎，基礎愈是打得根深蒂固，將來成功事業的希望愈大。所以當在打基礎的時候，我們要不要使牠打得愈牢愈深呢？要是現在不把基礎打定的話，那末長大以後，恐怕要打也來不及了。所以我現在願意把打基礎的幾種基本條件，來和諸位討論一下：</p>
<p>一禮貌：禮貌包括尊敬，莊嚴整潔諸點，無論對上對下，對窮對富，都得一樣地要有禮貌。</p>
<p>二忠實：忠費就是不虛偽，不敷衍，不忘本，忠原待人，誠實說話。</p>
<p>三虛心：一事一物，要謹愼處置，倘使一知半解，冒失從事，就很容易失敗。要多研究，勤討敎，處處存一點「虛心」，做事就便當多了。四耐苦：有刻苦耐勞的精神，就是有一筆讀書做事極大的「本錢」。</p>
<p>五有恒：耐苦以外，還要有恒心，做事有始無終，虎頭蛇尾，是最忌的。</p>
<p>六進取：我國過去時代的人，大都主張保守，而不知進取，所以各業發展都落在人家後面，處此大時代，我們要有處處求進步，事事求進步的精神。</p>
<h3>保健運動法（三）</h3>
<p>麥氏保健運動練習方式，共二十七種，以一至九為第一組，業於本期登完，下期起當續登第二組，（即十至第十九式及第三組，（即第二十至第二十七式）。</p>
<p>練習時，第一星期每天應做齊第一組，第二星期每天應自第一式做至第十九式，即第一及第二組合做，第三星期則須做齊全套，即自第一至第二十七，惟照此做法，如對於某種方式，自覺不甚嫻熟，而自然，或者是稍覺費力，那來寗可採取漸進主義，而切不可做超越自己體力的練習，因為「漸進」，實在是穩健而有效的辦法，它的進步，雖是比較慢些，但收效却和進步快的人一樣，所以體力較差的人，在前一種方式未會做熟以前，對於後一種，可無須念急地做。</p>
<p>保健運動，是適合於家庭中每一份子的一種良好運動，一經開始，即應當它是日常功課，一天也不可間斷，做的時候，固然不宜練習過度，但是對於似乎簡單而容易的幾種方式，也不可輕輕忽略過去，因為這種简易方式，或者就是它的特點的一部份，至於由運動或體操而出汗，早經一般人公認為有益於衛生，所以做保健運動時如自覺出汗，不甚爽暢，不妨看氣候怎樣，而酌量多穿一些衣服，作為出汗的幫助，不過要曉得運動比出汗要緊得多，所以出汘是否爽暢，到底是次要問題！</p>
<p>（圖七）身體平臥，兩臂伸展過頭，合掌，如圖，起上身，作坐勢，兩膝勿曲，試以手指尖與足趾相接觸，複做六次，紀數應以每值手指尖與足趾接觸為一次，按此乃老早就有的一種方式，但仍不失為最有益於身體的一種練習，因為它的功效，直達腹部肌筋及內臟部份，　於約束腹部，使不致成為便便大腹實在可稱是最有效的一種標　運動。</p>
<p>（圖八）身體平臥，兩臂及兩腿伸直，合掌，挺足，如圖，兩臂及兩腿張開還原狀，複做六次，記數應以每值兩臂及兩腿合攏為一次，初做時，宜稍慢，兩臂及兩腿，應使其盡量張開而後合攏，按此可使臀部，肩部，以及大小股，得有均衡動作機會而胸部則可因此而擴展以增加其呼吸量。</p>
<p>（圖九）身體平臥，兩臂及兩腿伸直，合掌，挺足，如第八圖，兩臂及兩腿互相交疊，先以右臂及右腿疊在上面，繼換以左臂及左腿，輪流做六次，記數應以每值右臂及右腿疊在上面為一次。</p>
<p>按平式原理和目的，與第八式同，但動作相反，所以使同系肌筋，而相對面仲展，祇須練習嫻熟，對於全部平衡發展，及血液循環，實有甚大之幫助，本式及第八式，動作宜緩面有序，勿用力過度。（第一組完）</p>

<h3>愛好虛榮的未婚妻</h3>
<p>— 鹿</p>
<p>編輯先生：是父母的嚴命，同時也經過我的同意，我和她訂婚了，她有着伶俐的口才和大方的儀態，更有一個討人喜歡的臉蛋，她可以使油鬰的人重展笑容。然而從我的觀察中，從第三者的言語裏，我知道她愛好虛榮，她曾為了她的母親不給她做新裝而和母親　星期不說話，她曾為沒有事一只手提袋而不去上課，她間為了請同學的客而賣了她的戒指，這是何等　可怕的一件事件，如果她的虛榮程度隨着進間而增加，那末我們結婚以後，她將會變成怎樣的程度呢，她會為了做新被非典和我吵嗎？她會為了買絲複而和我不歡嗎，她會為了……這許多我都不敢想。離開結婚的時間是一天近一天了，我不知道他的虛榮的心是否會因脫離學校而消滅，是否會因結婚而毀去，我眞不知道怎樣去應付。</p>
<p>鹿：你的未婚妻的虛榮心或者是在家裹過於嬌養，或者是同伴們的行動過於崇尙奢華，當她結婚以後而要希望立時毀滅她的虛榮心是不可能的，這祇有逐漸去使她不要再尙無素的印象，你不要灰心，不要失望，如果你們有深切的情愛校正她的個性，但造決不能操之過急，以免弄巧成拙。編者</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Cross the Ou River and Continue Advancing Towards Wenzhou; Japanese Aircraft Bomb Mountainous Areas</h3>
<p>From the Eleventh Day of the Allied News Agency Frontline in Zhejiang Province: Japanese troops threatening Wenzhou, the last important base in southeastern Zhejiang Province, reached both sides of the Ou River this afternoon, preparing to attack Wenzhou. Before advancing on Wenzhou, the Japanese troops captured key points such as Qingtian and Wenxi on the banks of the Ou River within four days after launching a new offensive. The Ou River, after repeated and severe flooding, is rapidly returning to its original state, and the Japanese naval forces are providing great assistance, accelerating the advance of the Japanese troops along the river. Japanese aircraft have also been conducting large-scale bombings of mountainous areas since early morning.</p>
<p>Eleventh Day of the Allied News Agency from a Japanese Base in Eastern Zhejiang: Japanese troops are still advancing south along the Ou River, having captured the Wenxi border up to eight kilometers southeast of that point, twenty kilometers from Wenzhou. This is the last important destination for the Japanese troops in northeastern Zhejiang Province. After crossing the Ou River, the Japanese troops have been attacking from both sides, and are still moving south towards Wenzhou.</p>
<p>Eleventh Day of the Allied News Agency from Jinhua: After occupying Wenxi, the Japanese troops on the Ou River arrived at the banks of the Ou River, eight kilometers southeast of the town and approximately twenty kilometers from Wenzhou, at 6:00 PM on the tenth. One unit crossed the Ou River near Xiushan, while another unit continued south along Yanshan.</p>
<h3>Thailand and Vietnam Sign Border Agreement in Saigon Yesterday; Vietnam Cedes Over 69,000 Square Miles of Land to Thailand</h3>
<p>Eleventh Day of the Allied News Agency from Saigon: Since the Thailand-French Vietnam Border Commission began its work on July 11th of last year, exactly one year has passed. Representatives from both sides, along with Japanese representatives, signed an agreement at the City Hall here this morning. According to a public statement, "The commissioners of the Japan, Thailand, and French Vietnam Border Affairs Commission held their fourth meeting at the Saigon City Hall this morning at 9:00 AM, signing several protocols, including (1) demarcating the border between French Vietnam and Thailand, (2) stipulating a demilitarized zone, and (3) a final protocol. After the signing ceremony, Commissioner Yano and the chief representatives of the French and Thai delegations delivered congratulatory speeches." According to the newly established border agreement, French Vietnam formally ceded 69,034 square miles of land, including northern and southern Laos and a portion of Cambodia, to Thailand.</p>
<p>Eleventh Day of the Allied News Agency from Saigon: The border dispute between Thailand and Vietnam, which has been mediated by Japan since January of last year, has been resolved after a year of effort with the conclusion of a treaty. The Border Demarcation Trilateral Commission convened its fourth plenary session at the Saigon City Hall on the eleventh, formally signing the new border protocol, the establishment of a demilitarized zone protocol, and the final protocol. Representatives from both the Japanese and Thai delegations arrived at the City Hall ten minutes before the start of the ceremony. At 11:00 AM sharp, the Japanese mediation representative, Chairman Yano, announced the opening of the meeting, and after reading the various protocols in Japanese, Thai, and Vietnamese, the fifteen representatives from the three countries formally signed the protocols, and then held a public meeting. After the guests were seated, Chairman Yano first gave a congratulatory speech, thanking the commissioners of the three countries for their hard work. Representatives from Vietnam and Thailand also gave speeches successively, and then went to another room to toast each other. This historically significant scene came to an end. The commission is scheduled to hold a formal dissolution ceremony at Panhe at the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Japan-Thailand Economic Negotiations Reach Agreement in Principle</h3>
<p>Eleventh Day of the Haitong News Agency from Bangkok: The Thai economic delegation, led by Panananda, returned home on the sixth after going to Tokyo for economic negotiations and obtaining a loan of 200 million yen. Today, he met with a reporter from the Haitong News Agency and stated that the economic negotiations had reached an agreement in principle, but detailed items still needed to be clarified. However, all his hopes had been fully realized. Japanese officials who participated in the negotiations in Tokyo also arrived in Bangkok with Envoy Hirota and will continue negotiations here, while other issues will be discussed with the embassy. Rice is the main export of Thailand, as everyone knows. Although Japan can now purchase the large quantities of goods it previously purchased in Thailand within its occupied areas, Japan will still purchase a certain amount of goods from Thailand in order to strengthen commercial and friendly relations between the two countries. The most important issue in Japan-Thailand commercial relations is the transportation issue. Thailand has very few ships, which are insufficient for its needs, so Thailand relies heavily on Japan and other countries. Therefore, Thailand must include clauses related to transportation issues in every commercial agreement it signs. Thailand has now borrowed 200 million yen from Japan, which is of great significance for Thailand's reconstruction efforts. Mr. Ba is very willing to answer various inquiries, but he regrets that he cannot provide detailed explanations.</p>
<h3>Fierce Air Battle Over Hengyang</h3>

<h3>Old Currency Redemption in Suzhou and Other Places to End on the Fourteenth</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: The Old Currency Consolidation Committee designated Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, and Shanghai and Nanjing cities for the redemption of old currency, which has already expired. Shanghai and Nanjing cities implemented a ban on the use of old currency starting June 25th. Now, the Ministry of Finance authorities have also explicitly stipulated that the ban on the use of old currency will be implemented uniformly in the "cleansed" areas (including Suzhou, Changshu, Taicang, Kunshan, Wuxi, Changzhou, and Jiangyin) starting July 15th. It is now learned that the extension of the redemption period for old currency in the cleansed areas has been decided to end on July 14th and will not be extended further. After the ban is implemented, if merchants or residents are found using old currency again, they will be punished according to law. The Old Currency Consolidation Committee has dispatched personnel to the various areas to conclude the redemption process.</p>
<h3>Gandhi Proposes Resolution to the Congress Party Insisting on Eliminating British Influence</h3>
<p>Eleventh Day of the Allied News Agency from Lisbon: According to Reuters' Walter Drey, Gandhi presented a resolution to the executive committee of the National Congress Party on the tenth. It is understood that the resolution aims to immediately begin an anti-British movement by emulating the methods of disobedience and passive resistance movement launched in 1941. The central argument of this resolution is that India's independence cannot be ensured unless British influence is expelled. It also advocates that the National Congress Party should immediately launch a military non-cooperation movement among the Indian people. The resolution also leaves room for future negotiations with the British government. Leaders of the Congress Party have expressed their opposition to compromise with Britain, so it is believed that this resolution demonstrates India's determined attitude towards Britain.</p>
<p>Eleventh Day of the Haitong News Agency from Bangkok: Yesterday, the All-India Congress Committee, which met in Sevagram, India, discussed the political situation in India.</p>
<h3>Philippine Government Receives Japanese Assistance to Improve Rural Areas</h3>
<p>Eleventh Day of the Allied News Agency from Manila: The Philippine government, with the assistance of the Japanese military administration, is actively working to improve rural areas and plans to purchase four major farms according to land sale contracts signed between the government and landowners, and distribute them to small farmers for cultivation.</p>

<h3>U.S. Lend-Lease Act Also Applies to Greece</h3>
<p>Tenth Day of the Havas News Agency from Washington: Secretary of State Hull signed an agreement with the Prime Minister of the Greek government-in-exile at the State Department today, stipulating that the United States will provide material assistance to Greece in accordance with the Lend-Lease Act. At the same time, it also stated: "The United States and Greece are determined to strive for final victory in the current war and to organize a lasting peace based on the United Nations Declaration of January 1, 1942."</p>
<h3>Japanese Organize Company to Salvage Sunken Ships</h3>
<p>Eleventh Day of the Allied News Agency from Tokyo: Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, a large number of enemy British and American ships have sunk in southern waters. In the spring of this year, Japan's Yamashita Steamship Co., Ltd. and others organized the Greater East Asia Naval Association to engage in salvage work. In view of the urgent need to expand shipping, it has been expanded and reorganized into the Greater East Asia Maritime Industries Co., Ltd., increasing its capital to 10 million yen. With the permission of the relevant authorities, it has been decided to convene an inaugural meeting at the end of July, and large-scale salvage operations will be carried out for sunken ships.</p>
<h3>U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz Slightly Injured</h3>
<p>Eleventh Day of the Allied News Agency from the Capital of Argentina: According to reports from Washington, Admiral Nimitz, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, was slightly injured yesterday when his plane crashed upon landing at a port on the West Coast during an inspection tour.</p>
<h3>Turkey Takes Preventive Measures on Border; Turkey Maintains Friendship with Britain and Germany; Foreign Policy Unlikely to Change</h3>
<p>Eleventh Day of the Havas News Agency from Istanbul: The military developments on the Soviet front and in Egypt have prompted the Turkish government to take preventive measures along its southeastern borders. The number of border troops has been increased, and the police have also tightened control in various regions. The government authorities are deeply concerned that if there is a collapse on either the Soviet or Egyptian side, large numbers of refugees will flee into Turkish territory. However, this does not mean that the border will be completely sealed; small-scale transportation will continue as usual.</p>
<p>Tenth Day of the Havas News Agency from the Capital of Turkey: After Prime Minister Saydam passed away in Istanbul a few days ago, his remains were transported here today by special train for a state funeral. President İsmet İnönü, Chief of General Staff General Çolak, the entire cabinet, and the Speaker of the Grand National Assembly greeted the coffin at the station. The coffin was then transported to the cemetery by artillery carriage for burial. At the same time, newspapers wrote articles welcoming former Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu as the successor to the Prime Minister, stating that Turkish foreign policy is unlikely to change as a result. The semi-official "Kömeljer" newspaper reported that Turkey is adhering to its neutral stance unchanged. Saraçoğlu, during his tenure as foreign minister, not only signed alliance treaties with Britain and France but also personally drafted a friendship treaty with Germany, leading Turkish foreign policy for many years. He has repeatedly stated that Turkey is determined to abide by both treaties. Since the outbreak of the European war, Turkey has always acted with a realistic spirit, and there is no reason to believe that Turkey will adopt any major decisions after this non-political cabinet reshuffle. According to news from the Balkan Peninsula, Saraçoğlu's appointment as the head of the Turkish government is extremely welcomed by neighboring countries. The Bulgarian semi-official "柴拉報" newspaper stated that Saraçoğlu's succession as Prime Minister is another clear demonstration of President İsmet İnönü's desire to implement Turkey's neutrality policy. Saraçoğlu is an experienced diplomat who is well-versed in international affairs, and his appointment as Prime Minister will certainly live up to the expectations of the people. In addition, Berlin also expressed goodwill towards Saraçoğlu, referring to him as the initiator of the German-Turkish friendship treaty.</p>
<h3>French Cabinet Discusses Attitude Towards the United States</h3>
<p>Tenth Day of the Allied News Agency from Vichy: The French government held a cabinet meeting on the tenth, at which Head of Government Laval reported on the results of his talks with the German authorities in Paris. It is reported that the cabinet meeting will carefully review whether the French government should abandon its previous equidistant attitude towards the United States.</p>
<h3>Over 170,000 French Workers Go to Germany</h3>
<p>Tenth Day of the Havas News Agency from Vichy: Since Head of Government Laval delivered a speech on the 22nd of last month, calling on French workers to go to work in Germany, tens of thousands have responded. Workers in the Paris industrial area have been particularly enthusiastic, with 11,658 people applying from June 24th to July 7th, including 2,715 women. In the provinces, many people have also voluntarily gone to work in Germany, especially in the industrial centers of southern France, such as Marseille, Nice, and Toulouse, where the recruitment of workers has been very successful. Marseille has recruited 2,000 people, Nice 900 people, and Toulouse 600 people. Foreign nationals who came to France to earn a living before the war have all transferred to Germany. No fewer than 6,000 Algerians from North Africa are also willing to work in Germany. As of the 30th of last month, a total of 170,800 French workers have already departed for Germany. The railway authorities have prepared four special trains to transport workers to Germany in the coming week, each train capable of carrying 900 workers. The total number of French workers registered to work in Germany from the 1st to the 10th of this month will be announced soon.</p>
<h3>U.S. Mobilizes to Search for Axis Submarines</h3>
<p>Tenth Day of the Allied News Agency from Zurich: The Geneva News' London correspondent recently reported that the U.S. government admitted on the fifth that the number of United Nations ships lost off the U.S. Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean Sea in the first half of this year totaled 307. This has stimulated British public opinion, and criticism of the U.S. for failing to protect its coast has intensified. The United States believes that the secret bases of the Axis submarines are within the United States, and has recently mobilized police officers to conduct extensive searches. However, the elusive activities of the Axis submarines have left Britain and the United States with no clues to be found.</p>
<p>Eleventh Day of the Haitong News Agency from Berlin: The Berlin Financial News detailed today the question of how Axis submarines have been able to repeatedly achieve success in the Caribbean Sea. The report first clarified the importance of the Caribbean Sea and its coastal areas. The author pointed out that the best oil fields in the United States are mostly located in the states of Texas and Louisiana, and the gasoline produced is transported to various locations on the Atlantic coast of the United States and Canada. The oil produced from the oil fields in Mexico is also transported through Caribbean ports for distribution. There are also oil fields in southern Venezuela, and the oil produced is mostly transported from the Gulf of Maracaibo to Aruba and Curaçao for refining. In addition to gasoline, sugar from Cuba, copper from Mexico, bauxite from Guyana, cotton from the southern United States, and bananas from the West Indies and Central America are all located in this area. Why is it that the United States has not strictly guarded such an important area, allowing Axis submarines to operate in the Caribbean Sea? U.S. expert Eliot Waterman wrote a book explaining the inadequacy of defense in this area. In 1939, the military bases of Puerto Rico and St. Thomas were still undefended. Although the ports of Tampa, Mobile, and New Orleans had been fortified, they did not have sufficient military force to defend them. Now, even if Britain and the United States want to strengthen their defenses, it cannot be completed in a short time. Therefore, the U.S. Navy cannot prevent German submarines from entering America's Mediterranean – the Caribbean Sea.</p>
<p>Islamic Holy Land – The Ancient City of Mecca</p>
<p>Mecca, in Saudi Arabia on the eastern shore of the Red Sea, is a world-renowned holy city of Islam. Annually, as many as 150,000 Muslims from various regions travel long distances to make a pilgrimage here. Before the birth of Muhammad, the founder of Islam, Mecca was already a trade center for caravans on the eastern shore of the Red Sea. The illustration shows vendors gathered in front of the city gate of Mecca. When pilgrims arrive here, they shout, "Lord, I have come to you, awaiting your command."</p>
<p>Allied Ships Continue to Be Sunk</p>
<p>Eleventh Day of the Haitong News Agency from Lisbon: Washington dispatches, the U.S. Navy Department announced yesterday that a British cargo ship, the "中星" (Zhong Xing), was sunk by an Axis submarine off the northern coast of South America. This is the fourth ship acknowledged by the U.S. Navy Department to have been sunk on Friday. Reports from Ottawa indicate that during a meeting of the Canadian House of Commons yesterday, it was revealed that a convoy of 14 Allied ships sailing from the Gulf of St. Lawrence was attacked by submarines en route, resulting in three ships being torpedoed and sunk.</p>
<p>Eleventh Day of the Haitong News Agency from Lisbon: Washington dispatches, the U.S. Navy Department announced last night that a small American cargo ship, a medium-sized British cargo ship, and a medium-sized Belgian cargo ship serving the United States have sunk in the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. The total number of ships sunk off the east coast of the United States has now reached 370.</p>
<p>Eleventh Day of the Haitong News Agency from Lisbon: The Cuban Naval Headquarters announced last night that a Honduran ship was sunk by gunfire from an Axis submarine. This is the eighth transport ship of the Allies to have been sunk yesterday.</p>
<p>List of British Ships Sunk Published</p>
<p>Eleventh Day of the Haitong News Agency from Berlin: The German High Command issued a statement saying that because Churchill has prohibited the publication of British tonnage losses, the British side has remained silent about its losses in the Atlantic war since June 1, 1941. Therefore, the German High Command will henceforth publish a list of British ships sunk. The first batch of fourteen ships has been published, with their names and tonnage as follows: "惠司晚麻蘭號" (Huisiwan Malanhao) (8,967 tons), "森茂色特厦號" (Senmaosete Xahao) (9,716 tons), "瑙福克號" (Naufukehao) (2,961 tons), "海洋冒險號" (Haiyang Maoxianhao) (6,800 tons), "霍金斯夫人號" (Huojinsifurenhao) (79,88 tons), "凱克波爾號" (Kaikeboerhao) (4,842 tons), "披爾麻號" (Pielmahao) (4,581 tons), "林洛斯坦號" (Linluositanhao) (5,478 tons), "克勞斯皮爾號" (Kelaosipierhao) (5,463 tons), "孫帝國號" (Sundiqiuhao) (力,228 tons), "阿登伏號" (Adengfuhao) (力,024 tons), "英加拿大號" (Ying Jianadahao) (5,268 tons), "勃洛特伐爾號" (Boloutefaerhao) (3,385 tons), and "海格男爵號" (Haigenanjuehao) (3,391 tons).</p>
<h3>Allied Convoy Lost in the Arctic Ocean</h3>
<p>Eleventh Day of the Haitong News Agency from Berlin: The German High Command announced last night that German aircraft and submarines have sunk a total of 230,070 tons of ships in a convoy attempting to reach Soviet ports via the Arctic Sea. German reconnaissance aircraft discovered three heavily loaded giant merchant ships sinking in the currents in the Barents Sea, with no ships or warships escorting them. German aircraft also discovered a defeated convoy in the Barents Sea, including three cargo ships, and launched a sudden attack despite the adverse weather, sinking a 7,000-ton cargo ship. At the same time, German submarines also sunk two transport ships fully loaded with tanks, with a total displacement of 13,000 tons. Therefore, the German army has sunk a total of 230,700 tons of enemy ships in the Arctic Sea.</p>
<h3>Traffic in Alaska Under U.S. Military Control</h3>
<p>Tenth Day of the Allied News Agency from Lisbon: According to reports from San Francisco, civilian travel to and from Alaska has been placed under the jurisdiction of the U.S. military authorities today. Anyone without special permission from the military authorities is prohibited from traveling to Alaska or from Alaska to other places. All transportation facilities are under the control of the Army and Navy authorities.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Restoration in Spain</h3>
<p>Eleventh Day of the Havas News Agency from the Capital of Switzerland: It is widely rumored in Berlin diplomatic circles that Spain is about to restore its monarchy. One of the main issues discussed during the recent visit of Spanish Foreign Minister Suñer to the Vatican was this matter. It is said that Suñer requested the Vatican to mediate among various countries.</p>
<h3>Vatican to Establish Diplomatic Relations with Finland</h3>
<p>Tenth Day of the Havas News Agency from Vatican City: The Vatican's official newspaper, "L'Osservatore Romano," recently reported that the Pope has accepted the Finnish government's request to exchange envoys, and Finland and the Vatican will soon establish normal diplomatic relations. It is reported that the Finnish government intends to appoint Gripenberg as the first Finnish Minister Plenipotentiary to the Vatican, which has been approved by the Pope.</p>

<h3>German Forces Launch Full-Scale Offensive Along the Don River; Front Line Extends 500 Miles; Soviets Admit Fall of Rossosh</h3>
<p>Allied News Agency, Berne, Switzerland, 11th. After German forces on the Eastern Front crossed the Don River at two locations, the main force of the Fourth Army led by Lieutenant General Kleist, though still concentrated on the west bank of the river, possesses sufficient strength to launch a large-scale offensive on the east bank. The German forces crossed the river at Voronezh and Rossosh. The Soviet authorities officially admitted the fall of Rossosh at midnight yesterday. The battle line from Voronezh to Rossosh is approximately 150 miles long, with about one million troops engaged on both sides, it is said.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Ankara, 11th. The Soviet midnight communique on Friday stated that Rossosh, located 150 miles east of Kharkov and 110 miles south of Voronezh on the lower Don River, has been lost.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Stockholm, Sweden, 10th. The German full-scale offensive against the Soviet Union is now underway. The objective of the German command is not to seize cities and territories, nor to annihilate the Red Army, but to inflict a fatal blow on the Soviet Union by capturing the industrial areas of the Donets Don River, Volga River, and Caucasus, all at once. Fierce battles are still in progress at Kursk, Voronezh, Kupiansk, and Rossosh, and are gradually spreading towards the Don and Volga rivers. Battlefield news remains chaotic. What is known is that the battle line extends for 500 miles, with hundreds of thousands of soldiers engaged. The positions are intricate, and the battle situation is confused. It is reported that at a certain battlefield, both sides used approximately 300 tanks each, engaging in fierce combat. German and Soviet aircraft are also assisting in the battle from the air. However, the ground battle is a complete melee, making it impossible to distinguish friend from foe when viewed from above, rendering it impossible for pilots to carry out bombing raids. German sources claim that the entire Soviet army has begun to collapse. However, the "Red Star," the Red Army's official newspaper, only admits that German forces entered the Rossosh region yesterday and that Soviet forces retreated to pre-arranged positions in excellent order. Another report states that the German Bock force is using no fewer than 2,000 tanks in that area. The main force of Timoshenko's army between the Oskol and Don rivers narrowly escaped encirclement. There was still street fighting in the northwest of Voronezh yesterday, but German forces have bypassed the city and continued to advance north, building several new bridges across the Don River, advancing both north and south, using the Don River as a shield to prevent Soviet flanking attacks. In addition, German forces from the northwest and southwest of Voronezh have made contact at Okol, a city 80 miles east of Voronezh on the railway line from Yelets to Stalingrad, forming a pocket. The Soviet forces in the pocket are fiercely resisting the shrinking perimeter, but after a fierce battle, the Soviet forces have broken through a three-mile gap in the north, and part of the Soviet forces have broken out and made contact with General Chuykov's forces. Furthermore, German forces have been massing troops at Kursk, Belgorod, and Kupiansk in recent days, and it is said that they have broken through the Soviet lines and are advancing east and southeast, which is likely a prelude to a large-scale military operation.</p>
<p>Thrilling Tank Battles: German Side Employs Mysterious Tactics</p>
<p>Allied News Agency, Lisbon, 10th. According to American sources, German forces that arrived after linking Voronezh and Rossosh suddenly deployed over 2,000 tanks on the 10th, completing the crossing of the Don River. Both sides are now engaged in tank battles in a certain area of Voronezh. Thousands of tanks from both armies are concentrated in a small area, and heavy rain has caused both armies to engage in deadly combat in the mud.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 11th. German military experts recently stated that the German and Allied forces adopted new tactics during the large-scale offensive on the southern sector of the Eastern Front. Before the offensive was launched, the concentration and movement of troops was shrouded in mystery. Even General Timoshenko's aerial reconnaissance was unable to obtain any information, and he was unable to take timely countermeasures. The concentration of German troops and equipment was like flowing water, never staying in one place for more than 24 hours. Therefore, the necessary troops were concentrated in a selected location within 24 hours before the offensive was launched. Due to the vastness of the theater of war, this tactic has achieved remarkable results, it is said.</p>
<p>Successful Counteroffensive in the Oryol Region: Soviet Forces Advance Over 70 Miles</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Stockholm, Sweden, 10th. According to Soviet sources, the Soviet counteroffensive in the Oryol region has resulted in an advance of over 70 miles. German forces are reportedly massing reinforcements to rush to the area.</p>
<p>Allied News Agency, Berlin, 11th. The German official news agency reported that Soviet forces attempted to land on the Kerch Peninsula at the eastern end of Crimea but were repelled by German coastal defense forces.</p>
<h3>Breaking Two Days of Silence: Fierce Fighting Resumes in Egypt; German Forces Launch New Offensive at El Alamein; British Consolidate Defenses in the Nile Delta</h3>
<p>Allied News Agency, Lisbon, 11th. According to Cairo sources, after British forces in Egypt launched a strong attack on the northern front lines at El Alamein and were repelled by Axis forces, German General Rommel immediately led his troops in a sudden attack from the southern sector, advancing further east. British sources say that there is no correlation between the two locations, while a British communique acknowledges that Axis forces on the southern sector have moved east and that fighting is taking place in that area. The sudden outbreak of fighting has broken the two-day silence of the fierce battles in the Egyptian desert.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Rome, 11th. Italian military headquarters officials stated that fierce fighting is taking place in the El Alamein area. Axis forces on the southern sector have forced the enemy to retreat, while fierce fighting has also broken out on the northern sector, with repeated enemy attacks failing. The German and Italian air forces engaged in a major battle with enemy aircraft yesterday, shooting down 33 enemy aircraft.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, Sweden, 11th. According to London sources, the battle for Alexandria has already begun. It is still uncertain whether the power to launch the battle rests with General Rommel or General Auchinleck. The British believe that Auchinleck, having received a large number of reinforcements, seems capable of launching a large-scale offensive. It is reported that Auchinleck has issued an order prohibiting the release of any reports regarding the battle at present.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Egyptian Border Area, 10th. The Egyptian battle is currently in a stalemate, which is likely a prelude to a large-scale German offensive. The warring parties are temporarily adopting a mutually vigilant posture. The fighting has been particularly quiet for the past 24 hours, with sparse artillery fire and infantry activity limited to patrols. British forces once launched a localized attack on the southern sector. The British authorities are clearly wary of the German preparations to attack the Nile Delta and are now shortening their defensive lines and attempting to prevent Axis forces from consolidating their positions in the occupied areas. However, the strength of General Rommel's forces in North Africa remains very strong. The current stalemate does not mean that the plan to attack the Nile Delta has been abandoned. Military experts agree that the German forces will launch a renewed offensive to the east within two or three weeks. As the forces of General Auchinleck, commander of British forces in the Middle East, continue to receive reinforcements, the Axis authorities will find it difficult to sit idly by and are more inclined to attack as soon as possible rather than delaying further. At the same time, the Axis authorities appear to be making every effort to improve and strengthen their transportation lines to enable reinforcements to arrive quickly and provide support to troops who have been fighting hard for about seven weeks. The Axis forward positions are also being strengthened. Their lines are not continuous; some strongholds have trenches and are equipped with strong artillery and flat-trajectory gun emplacements, and are defended by artillery and infantry. Their armored divisions are resting behind the lines, waiting to be replenished with fresh troops. On the British side, their 9th and 10th Army units are constantly arriving to allow the badly defeated 8th Army to be fully reorganized. Minor defensive works have also been deployed on the Nile Delta.</p>
<p>Silence Before the Storm: Egyptian Crisis Unabated</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, Sweden, 11th. According to the latest reports from London, the situation in North Africa remains unchanged. Apart from minor skirmishes and artillery duels, the situation can generally be described as quiet, but its seriousness has not diminished. It would be premature to say that General Rommel's offensive has been definitely repelled. According to military experts, the outcome of this battle will depend on who can obtain the fastest and strongest reinforcements. London acknowledges that General Rommel has received substantial reinforcements in the past few days, while British reinforcements and war materials are steadily arriving at Alexandria. Captain Hart, the Daily Mail's military correspondent, says that unless the Axis forces are defeated or driven back to Tobruk, the current crisis will not be eliminated. The current lull is not a sign of an improvement in the situation. It can be called the silence before the storm. The repair shops behind the Axis lines are reconditioning tanks. As long as General Rommel's tanks are not completely destroyed, the Egyptian crisis will not be eliminated.</p>
<p>Tanks Equipped with Large-Caliber Guns are Powerful Weapons</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Berne, Switzerland, 10th. Military experts here recently stated that the current major battle in Egypt has changed the strategic use of tanks. Two years ago, when the desert war first broke out, both sides mostly viewed tanks as a kind of "modern cavalry" or used them as assault troops, but today they have long been transformed into a kind of mobile artillery battery. All tanks are equipped with large-caliber guns, with gunners concealed behind armor, providing comprehensive protection, which is incomparable to ordinary field guns that can only operate in strongly fortified positions. Therefore, large-caliber guns on tanks occupy a most important position in modern warfare. The German adoption of heavy tanks is for this reason. As for light tanks, they can only be used to protect heavy tanks, serving an auxiliary function. In addition, the air force also occupies an extremely important position in the desert war. Dive bombers are the most powerful weapon in modern warfare. They can be divided into two groups during operations. The first group carries out bombing missions, while the second group patrols the sky to protect the first group of aircraft. After a considerable period of time, the second group is transferred to the front line for bombing, while the first group of aircraft is recalled to the rear. This rotation can be carried out continuously from morning to evening, constantly bombing airfields, barracks, and tank repair factories. However, according to Cairo sources, Britain has recently concentrated a large number of aircraft in Egypt, gaining air superiority. However, British military officials believe that the difficult phase of the Egyptian war has not yet passed.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 11th. The German High Command announced yesterday that on Thursday, British positions in the desert area near El Daba, a water source between the Egyptian coast and the Qattara Depression, were repeatedly subjected to German air raids. British heavy artillery and infantry in the trenches suffered heavy casualties. German aircraft also carried out low-altitude attacks on British supply vehicles on the coastal highway, and a large number of vehicles caught fire and burned.</p>
<h3>British and American Nationals in Egypt Ordered to Evacuate</h3>
<p>Allied News Agency, Lisbon, 11th. Today, news from Cairo via Istanbul stated that British nationals in Egypt who do not have an urgent reason to remain in the country have all received orders to evacuate Egypt. The Union of South Africa has begun to make arrangements to accommodate British nationals evacuated from Egypt. Approximately 4,000 British nationals in Egypt will be affected by the evacuation order. It is also reported that the American authorities have issued an evacuation order to American nationals in Egypt. Copts and Jews have begun to evacuate from Egypt.</p>
<h3>Italian Minister of Trade Riccardi Returns to Rome</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Rome, 10th. Italian Minister of Foreign Trade Riccardi recently visited Germany, where he consulted with German economic leaders on trade issues between the two countries. Several new agreements have been reached. Having completed his mission, he returned here today. It is reported that the outcome of the talks proves that both sides wish to stabilize prices and currency values.</p>

<h3>Ancient and Modern Arabia (5)</h3>
<p>Two Dynasties</p>
<p>After the death of Muhammad, the political, religious, and military leadership of Arabia was passed on to his great disciples. These successors were called Caliphs (representatives of the prophet) instead of prophets. The first Caliph was Muhammad's father-in-law, Abu Bakr. The second Caliph was Muhammad's favorite disciple, Umar. The third Caliph was Uthman, a member of the Umayyad clan in Mecca. The fourth Caliph was Muhammad's son-in-law, Ali. They all took Medina as their capital. Under their leadership, the power of the Islamic state expanded outwards, while the Romans and Persians continued their struggles.</p>
<p>Under the organization and leadership of these Caliphs, the Arabs conquered various regions and established a great Arab empire. They captured Syria in 635, Palestine in 638, then the mountainous region of Armenia in Asia Minor. They entered Egypt in 646, captured Cyprus in 649, and then advanced westward along the coast of North Africa, from Egypt to Tripoli (now Libya), then Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco, bringing the Berber and Moorish peoples of North Africa into the embrace of Islam. In 712, they crossed the Strait of Gibraltar and arrived on the Iberian Peninsula, sweeping away the Visigothic tribal kingdom. From there, they advanced north almost to the plains of France. Advancing eastward, they entered Mesopotamia in 637 and completely conquered the New Persian Kingdom in 650. Thus, by the centennial of Muhammad's death (731), this great Arab empire stretched from the banks of the Indus River in the east to the Atlantic coast in the west, from the Arabian Sea in the south to Asia Minor in the north. In this great empire, the Arabs, needless to say, held all military and political power. However, they were relatively tolerant of religious beliefs, allowing people to accept Islam voluntarily. This is contrary to the general historical narrative that Muhammad held a sword in one hand and the Quran in the other to forcibly spread Islam.</p>
<p>The fifth Caliph created a new dynasty name, simply called Caliph, did not obey the established rules of selection, but wanted to exclusively own the title of Caliph with the new precedent of father to son inheritance. This Caliph was called the Umayyad Dynasty, and its capital was moved from Medina to Damascus in Syria. This new Caliphate Dynasty, which was passed down through generations, lasted for nearly a hundred years (661-749) before a revolution occurred. The great Islamic empire began to split. In this divided Islamic empire, the Turkic people of Central Asia, through a process of gradual infiltration, replaced the Arabs in leading the Islamic movement. The glory of the Arab people gradually faded.</p>
<p>The revolution occurred in 750 AD. In that year, a descendant of Muhammad's close relative, Abbas, rose up and overthrew the Umayyad Dynasty, which had held the Caliphate for a hundred years, and established a new dynasty - the Abbasid Caliphate - and the capital was moved from Damascus to Baghdad, on the lower Tigris River. As a result, the center of gravity of the Arab empire shifted to the east, and all aspects of life and customs gradually became easternized. The most famous Caliph in this new dynasty was Harun, who was contemporary with Charlemagne, the Frankish king of Europe. During Harun's reign, the Arabs' cultural and military achievements were very brilliant.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the establishment of this new dynasty led to the great division of the Arab empire. The overthrown Umayyad family fled from Damascus, passed through North Africa, and escaped to the Iberian Peninsula. They were supported by the Moors and declared themselves Caliphs in 929, with Cordoba as their capital, ruling over the Iberian Peninsula. In Egypt, an Arab clan called the Fatimids (this clan was Muhammad's son-in-law's family) declared themselves Caliphs in 969 AD, with Cairo as their capital, ruling over all of North Africa. Thus, the Arab empire was divided into three centers, each hostile to the others, and each striving on its own. These three centers later failed to maintain overall unity. Local chieftains arose in each of their domains. For example, in the domain of the Abbasid Caliphate, the Seljuk Turks rose to power. The Arabs were on the decline there. The Abbasid Caliphate was completely destroyed in 1258, the Fatimid Caliphate was completely destroyed in 1517, and the Umayyad Caliphate on the Iberian Peninsula was destroyed by the Kingdom of Castile in northern Spain in the 14th century.</p>

<h3>Severe Cholera Outbreak: Decision to Re-implement Forced Vaccination; Two-Week Campaign to Begin on the 16th, and Sale of Raw Fish Will Be Prohibited</h3>
<p>The oppressive heat in this city subsided slightly yesterday, and the wind was strong throughout the day. According to the observatory, the highest temperature yesterday was 92.7 degrees Fahrenheit (34 degrees Celsius), a decrease of two degrees compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Lockdown and Disinfection in the Xiaodongmen District</p>
<p>According to a report from a Datong News Agency reporter, Huang Shunqing, a resident on the second floor of the Guohua Bank at No. 1 Xiaodongmen Main Street in the French Concession, also contracted cholera. After being sent to the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital and dying despite treatment, the French Concession Health Department dispatched eight health workers to the residence yesterday afternoon to carry out disinfection work. Xiaodongmen Main Street was temporarily closed from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM, and the closure was lifted after the disinfection was completed.</p>
<p>Five New Cholera Cases</p>
<p>Among the inpatients at the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, 13 cholera patients have been discovered one after another, and one person has died despite treatment. Five more cases have now been discovered (18 cases in total). The names, ages, and places of origin are listed below: Zhu Ayue, 4 years old, female, Shaoxing native, residing at No. 18 Jianqiao Bridge, Huining Road, Nanshi; Wei Abao, 12 years old, male, Wuxi native, residing at No. 80 Hongkou Road, Zhabei; Wang Zhengyi, 24 years old, male, Hangzhou native, residing at No. 2 Sian Lane, Gonghe Road, Zhabei; Shen Amao, 7 years old, female, Shaoxing native, residing at No. 526 Jianqiao Bridge, Huining Road, Nanshi; Wang Ye Shi, 25 years old, female, Ningbo native, residing at No. 86 Shipin Lane, Zhaojia Road, Nanshi.</p>
<p>Immunity Can Only Be Achieved Through Two Vaccinations</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, it has been learned that the Shanghai Epidemic Prevention Committee met at the Xingya Institute office at 5:00 PM on Thursday and decided to conduct a second round of forced vaccinations in the city from July 16th to more effectively combat the epidemic. It was also disclosed that the sale of raw fish in stores and markets will be prohibited, as it is believed that the spread of the disease is partly due to the consumption of raw fish. The second vaccination will begin on July 16th and will last for two weeks. Two vaccinations are sufficient to prevent this rapidly spreading disease. Therefore, all Shanghai residents must receive their second vaccination before July 30th.</p>
<p>Prohibition of Raw Fish Sales is Necessary</p>
<p>Regarding the prohibition of raw fish sales, the Epidemic Prevention Committee believes that it is necessary. It has been found that fish, especially when eaten raw, is harmful to health in the summer. The Municipal Council will soon issue a notice implementing the second vaccination and prohibiting the sale of raw fish. There have been 14 cases of cholera in the past week, so the urgency of the second vaccination is self-evident. Yesterday, the French Municipal Council Health Department disclosed that a blind Chinese beggar in the French Concession died of cholera four days ago. This is the only case of cholera in the French Concession so far. It is believed that this beggar resided near the frequently-affected Nanshi, which led to the contraction of the disease.</p>
<h3>Dyed Yarn Black Market Completely Eliminated Yesterday; Telephones Have Been Cut Off, Markets No Longer Open; Spot Yarn Market Still Operating Normally</h3>
<p>A Tongmeng News Agency report from this city states that the concession authorities, in view of rising prices being largely manipulated by speculative merchants, which is increasingly burdening the livelihood of the people, have strictly prohibited black market trading and hoarding to curb speculation and suppress prices. The rising trend has only slightly subsided. However, due to recent clandestine activities involving cash and futures trading in "Double Horse" brand yarn, the market situation has become tight again. In view of this, the Municipal Council has dispatched special agents to conduct strict investigations and crack down on speculative behavior in order to eliminate illegal trading. Speculators have been apprehended and are being punished. As a result, the market is increasingly panicked, and speculators dare not take risks. It is reported that as of yesterday, the 11th, black market trading in dyed yarn has been completely eliminated. Telephones have been cut off, and transactions cannot be conducted. Previous gathering places have been disbanded, and the "Double Horse" brand market has also temporarily suspended operations.</p>
<p>A Datong News Agency report states that the Shanghai Ningbo Road Tonghe Lane Yarn and Cloth Association, its second-floor meeting hall has long been engaged in the trading of "Double Horse" brand 20-count cotton yarn factory orders, while the ground floor has been engaged in spot trading of various brands of Chinese and Japanese cotton yarn. The second-floor factory order market has been particularly prosperous, being the largest speculative market in the city. All yarn firms and banks use its price fluctuations as a benchmark. However, due to the current circumstances, it will officially cease trading starting next Monday (tomorrow). All old transactions were settled clearly yesterday. The second-floor market premises will also no longer be open starting tomorrow, but the ground-floor spot market will continue to operate as usual.</p>
<h3>Second Ration Distribution to Begin Tomorrow Morning; Preparations for Next Month's Permit Issuance Soon to Commence</h3>
<p>The second-term household rice rations submitted by rice shops in both concessions to the Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Management Committee were fully delivered yesterday morning. A total of 415 rice shops in the Public Concession received a total of 12,392 bags of white rice, 6,198 bags of broken rice, and 51,049 bags of flour. 214 rice shops in the French Concession received a total of 6,646 bags of white rice, 3,323 bags of broken rice, and 27,865 bags of flour.</p>
<p>Rice Shops Complete Delivery of Second-Term Rations</p>
<p>After the above rice and flour were delivered, all rice shops in both concessions have decided to begin selling on the morning of the 13th at 8:00 AM, based on the second stub of the rice purchase permit. Each rice purchase permit will entitle the holder to one "sheng" of white rice and half a "sheng" of broken rice, priced at 3.8 yuan in reserve currency, with a supplementary purchase of 1.5 "jin" of flour, priced at 3 yuan and 7 jiao in reserve currency. However, citizens are free to decline the supplementary purchase of flour. If both white rice and flour are purchased, the total cost will be 7 yuan and 5 jiao. Citizens must bring their own containers for the flour when purchasing to facilitate the process.</p>
<p>First Stub of Rice Permit to be Voided Today</p>
<p>Sales of household rice based on the first stub of the rice purchase permit ended at 6:00 PM yesterday. They cannot be used for purchase after today. As of 6:00 PM yesterday, rice shops had not sold all of their allocated household rice. It is understood that rice shops must report any remaining household rice to the authorities for verification in due course. The remaining household rice can only be stored in the shop. At the same time, those who have not received a rice purchase permit can apply for a replacement at the rice permit issuance offices. The deadline for replacement applications was also yesterday. Preparations for issuing August rice purchase permits will begin next week.</p>
<h3>Verdict on the Case of Cantonese Woman Chen Huangshi: Exemption from Punishment</h3>
<p>Chen Huangshi, a Cantonese woman residing at No. 225 Gan Village, Gan Si Dong Road, had two sons and one daughter. Due to financial difficulties, Huangshi worked as a domestic helper at the home of her fellow villager, Lu Tianyou, at No. 370, Lane 3, Albert Road. She was falsely accused of theft and unjustly wronged. In her resentment, she returned home on the 25th of last month and purchased five yuan worth of coal briquettes. That evening, she lit the coal stove in the small pavilion, gathered her two sons, Guozhu (18 years old) and Guojun (9 years old), and her daughter, Cuixia, intending to end their lives together by suffocation. The following day, they were discovered by someone and sent to the hospital. The two sons could not be saved and died one after the other. Chen Huangshi and her daughter miraculously survived. The French police charged Chen Huangshi with inciting suicide and immediately interrogated her. The details have been reported in this newspaper. We now learn that the case was judged yesterday, and Chen Huangshi was exempted from punishment. A few days ago, Mr. Zhang Xiaosheng entrusted this newspaper to forward a savings certificate for one hundred yuan to Chen Huangshi for living expenses, which has already been reported. We have now received donations of ten yuan each from the mother of Mr. Pu Quting, as well as Mrs. Pu, Zou Yunyu, and the two young masters, Fu Kang and Jie Yuan, totaling forty yuan in savings certificates. This will also be delivered by a special messenger from this newspaper. Now that Chen Huangshi has been acquitted, she must find another means of livelihood to avoid further displacement.</p>

<h3>Grand Celebrations at Catholic Churches Across the City This Morning: Centenary of the Second Arrival of Jesuit Missionaries in China; Bishop Haou Presides Over Dedication of the Jiangnan Diocese</h3>
<p>Since the arrival of Matteo Ricci in China in 1582 to preach Christianity, the Jesuit missionaries of the Catholic Church have had a glorious history of over three hundred years in contributing to Chinese society and culture. However, in the late eighteenth century, the Jesuit order was once suppressed, and the missionaries ceased coming to China. In 1814, after the Jesuit order was restored by order of the Pope in Rome, Chinese people, in memory of the legacy of Matteo Ricci, Johann Adam Schall von Bell and other pioneers who stayed in China, requested the Jesuit Superior General to send missionaries to China again to preach Christianity.</p>

<h3>*Shen Bao*'s Third Scholarship Fund: Application Dates Determined; Starting from the 20th of This Month</h3>

Applications by letter will not be accepted. The forms must be completed carefully and submitted to the office as soon as possible. The filling of the forms must be detailed. Any forms that are careless or unclear will not be accepted.</p>
<p>List of Free Scholarships to Be Announced Soon</p>
<p>Letters from various primary schools, middle schools, and supplementary schools in this city donating free places have been pouring in, and their kindness is deeply appreciated. A list will be compiled and published in the newspaper after it has been organized so that admissions can be reviewed and recommended. Schools donating half-fee places will be politely declined due to the complicated procedures. Schools donating free places in summer schools will also be politely declined due to the limited time available to process them. Applicants for scholarships and the authorities of schools that are enthusiastically donating free places should be aware of these points.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Zhonghua Company donated 1,000 yuan, and Mr. Li Zhiyang donated 20 yuan, totaling 1,020 yuan. The previous balance was 50,663 yuan and 44 cents. The total balance is 51,683 yuan and 44 cents.</p>

<h3>A Brief Account of Mr. Jiang Weiqiao, the Promoter of Quiet Sitting</h3>
<p>Jiang Weiqiao, also known as Yinshizi, has researched the method of quiet sitting for decades, earning fame and praise from the people of the country. However, he has never personally taught it. Now, he has established a Quiet Sitting Society to teach it publicly. Mr. Jiang has been harboring this intention for a long time but dared not be confident in the past, so he has been hesitant to act. Now that he has a little more confidence, he is trying it at the request of relatives and friends. Most of the students are from the business community, ranging in age from over sixty to around twenty. The classes last for two months, only four times a month. This short period is only for teaching the theory and method of quiet sitting. As for the benefits, they depend entirely on the self-cultivation of the students, without forgetting the heart or helping it. Success can only be achieved with years of effort. The most difficult thing to seek in quiet sitting is to relax the mind. The first thing to do is to focus the mind in one place and to use observation skills at all times. Mr. Jiang's body and mind seem to be getting healthier as he gets older. However, recently, due to too much work and excessive use of energy, he often suffers from insomnia. The Cheng Zheng Literary Society, which was reorganized at Guanghua University, originally had him as the chairman of the executive committee. From May of this year, he has resigned as chairman. Recently, it was reported that he was lecturing on Chinese cultural history at the summer study group in the Special Zone. According to Mr. Jiang, this was indeed the case, but I declined politely due to old age and failing spirit, for fear of summer heat, truthfully declining, and have been understood. However, the employer insisted on recommending a replacement. The next day, he obtained the consent of Mr. Yang Zhongyi and wrote a letter of recommendation. The other day, he saw Mr. Yang, who had already received the letter of appointment. The report in the newspapers may be based on hearsay. Mr. Jiang does not intend to take on any work other than promoting the method of quiet sitting in the next semester. He will close his doors to guests and engage in recuperation.</p>

<h3>Guobin Cup Round Gateball Tournament: Hua Nan Pharmacy and Guang Xia Meet Today; Teammates of the Women's Group Meet Again</h3>
<p>The fourth act of the first Guobin Cup Round Gateball League will take place today, starting at 5:30 PM at the Guangxia Stadium, with three exciting programs. The first match is between teammates of the women's group. The You team has many talented players, such as Zhang Jiapei, Yan Weiwen, Huang Mingyuan, Zhu Shifang, and Liu Zhenshi, all of whom are well-known in the gateball world and outstanding talents among the women's army. They made their debut last week and defeated Aiguo 1-0, winning their first match. All of the Lingsheng players are also as lively as dragons and tigers, with very high technical standards, and should not be underestimated. It is expected that the first battle between the two strong teams will be a lively performance. There are two matches in the men's group. Yaoguang and Huanan meet by chance. The two teams have each won once, and their strengths are equal. Yaoguang has gathered veteran players Wang Shoufang, Zhou Jun, and Zhang Jin, with the iron gate Dong Jincai guarding the gate. The defense is as solid as a rock. Huanan has recently dominated the basketball world and is invincible, seeming to have the aura of a hegemon. The momentum is unparalleled for a time. Today's battle with Yaoguang will surely have an earth-shattering and intense performance. The other men's group match is between Qiangxing and Nanyang. Although the latter is strong, it is predicted that the former will be able to pose a considerable threat. Tickets are one yuan, and the schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>You Team vs. Lingsheng (Women) 5:30 PM</p>
<p>Qiangxing vs. Nanyang (Men) 6:15 PM</p>
<p>Yaoguang vs. Huanan (Men) 7:00 PM</p>
<h3>Xinpei Cup Charity Mini-Football: Longwei Wins Against St. Francis; Score 5-2; No Winner Between Tai Gong and Movie Stars</h3>

In the final match, Longwei defeated St. Francis by a large margin of 5-2 with the wind at their backs. Halfway through the match, an auction of the game ball began. After much competition, it was sold to dance star Wang Xiaomei for 1,100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Preparing for Exams (3)</h3>
<p>— Hu Zuyin</p>
<p>Maintaining Physical and Mental Health. This seems like a cliché, but examinees often fail to do it. People who "cram at the last minute" often study day and night, resulting in insufficient sleep and dizziness. On the day of the exam, they are listless or even too sick to take the exam. People who have prepared well can relax and rest a day or two before the exam, ready to face the exam. Therefore, examinees should prepare well in advance so that they can have adequate rest and sleep before the exam and be in a comfortable state in all aspects of their body.</p>
<p>Another point is to maintain mental health. Some people may have prepared well for the subjects they are going to take and maintain their health. But in terms of psychology, they have deep worries and fears. They worry about not being admitted, and they even have a kind of "inferiority complex," thinking that they are always inferior to others and that they will not be admitted this time. This kind of "inferiority complex" can sometimes cause examinees to lose confidence, so they hesitate about questions that can be answered or dare not confidently write down the answers, which will certainly affect their exam results. Therefore, before the exam, we must not only maintain our physical health but also pay attention to having a good and confident attitude psychologically.</p>
<p>Things to Note During the Exam</p>
<p>After an examinee has made adequate and proper preparations before the exam, he or she can confidently take the exam on the specified date. But there are still four things to note during the exam, which examinees should not ignore:</p>
<p>Understand the Questions. If you cannot understand the questions during the exam, you will often answer irrelevantly, working hard for nothing. Examinees should first read through all the questions briefly, paying attention to whether there are any areas they do not understand or questions they cannot answer at all. After reading through them briefly, carefully study each question. Some questions require detailed answers, while others can be briefly described. Some questions include two or three parts, and some questions require examples. After determining the nature and meaning of the questions, you can begin writing.</p>
<p>Start Writing. After understanding the questions, some examinees often sit in their seats, staring blankly at the paper. They hope that a kind of "inspiration" will arise in their minds and that they will be able to "write like a god." This kind of "dreaming" attitude is wrong because on the one hand, it can waste valuable exam time, and on the other hand, it can affect your efforts during the exam.</p>
<p>Therefore, after understanding the questions, you should form a proper answer in your mind. After the answer is formed, you should start writing. According to psychological research, mental activity often develops with the activity of the muscles of the body. During writing, the activity of the muscles of the hand can cause mental activity. The reason why many good ideas often naturally flow out when we write is this. Therefore, when we write, we should continue to write like a silkworm spinning silk. Sometimes, when writing the answer to the first question, you suddenly think of a good idea to answer the second or third question. At this time, you can temporarily stop writing and write down this valuable idea next to the relevant question to avoid forgetting it.</p>
<p>Manage Time. When answering questions, pay attention to how many questions there are and how much time there is, and then allocate the time appropriately. You can allocate the same amount of time to questions of comparable difficulty. You should leave more time to answer particularly difficult questions. If the exam paper does not specify that you must answer the questions in order, you can do the easy questions first and leave the difficult questions to the end, so that you can have enough time to think about the answers without affecting the answers to other questions.</p>
<p>Maintain Self-Confidence. As mentioned in the previous section, it is not advisable to worry or fear before the exam. During the exam, it is even more important to maintain self-confidence and take the exam calmly. If examinees can maintain a positive attitude and be confident that they have a hope of success in the exam, it can often help the development of thoughts and the completion of answers. With strong self-confidence, you can write calmly, and your thoughts will flow smoothly. Your comprehension and judgment will also be improved, and success in the exam can be considered as a matter of course. (End)</p>

<h3>Essential Qualities of a Housewife</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>Because a housewife manages the affairs of a family, her position in the family is very important. Fenny Hurst, the author of *Long Live Women*, once said, "If you educate a man, you only educate one person; if you educate a woman, you educate the whole family."</p>
<p>In recent years, many countries have paid close attention to preparing women for marriage and have set up home economics courses in schools. They teach sewing, cooking, family organization, child psychology, consumer issues, home furnishings, food and nutrition, and family management. Generally, it is believed that to be a successful housewife, one must have the following characteristics:</p>
<p>1.  Personal Hygiene: Because family hygiene must start with the individual, if the housewife herself does not have hygiene knowledge, then there is no way to talk about the hygiene of the whole family.</p>
<p>2.  Neat Appearance: This does not mean dressing luxuriously, only neatly, so it does not involve economic issues.</p>
<p>3.  Creative Spirit: A housewife must have a creative spirit for new home management methods, be brave in making improvements, and not stick to old rules.</p>
<p>4.  Forward-Looking Aspirations: Regardless of her past or current status, she must have forward-looking aspirations, so that she can make progress.</p>
<p>5.  Elegant Character: She must have an elegant character that makes people welcome, including good attitude, posture, etc.</p>
<p>6.  Noble Morality: She must have noble morality, so that she can be respected by others and serve as a role model for her children.</p>
<p>Being a housewife is really not an easy thing, and women who are already housewives can be proud of themselves.</p>
<h3>How to Raise an Infant</h3>
<p>— Yingying</p>
<p>Raising a child is a seemingly easy yet difficult job. If a mother raises her infant properly, the infant will grow up healthy; otherwise, the infant may experience incomplete development or even die prematurely. This is something that must be paid attention to.</p>
<p>When it comes to childcare, the first and foremost thing is that the best food for an infant is the mother's milk. Unless there are special circumstances, a mother should breastfeed her own child and never hire a wet nurse or use cow's milk. Many women use cow's milk to feed their babies, which is very inappropriate. Mothers and nurses with some experience all know that infants cannot grow by eating cow's milk alone. We can compare cow's milk with human milk to understand this.</p>
<p>(A) Human milk has a neutral reaction, while cow's milk has an acidic reaction.</p>
<p>(B) Human milk does not contain bacteria, while cow's milk contains countless bacteria.</p>
<p>(C) If we calculate the composition of human milk as a percentage, it contains 3.3% fat, 0.7% protein, 0.8% casein, and 7.0% lactose. Cow's milk contains 3.5% fat, 0.7% protein, 2.8% casein, and 5.0% lactose.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the difference between human milk and cow's milk is significant. Commonly, cow's milk is diluted with water to feed infants, but this really cannot be considered a physiologically proper food for infants.</p>
<p>Originally, the composition of breast milk is suitable for the infant's digestion, without excessive richness or accumulation. There is nothing more exquisite and healthy than breast milk in the world. As for the method of breastfeeding, there must be a certain schedule. After each breastfeeding, a healthy mother must wait for more than two hours for the baby's stomach to empty. After emptying, the stomach needs to have a sufficient rest. Therefore, the interval between each breastfeeding should be at least three hours, such as breastfeeding at 6 am, 9 am, 12 pm, 3 pm, 6 pm, and 9 pm each day, for a total of six times, with rest at night. After one or two months, as the infant's milk intake gradually increases, the number of feedings can be reduced from six to five times, with an interval of four hours each time, such as breastfeeding at 6 am, 10 am, 2 pm, 6 pm, and 10 pm. During the day, if the infant is sleeping soundly, he should be awakened, but at night, the infant can be allowed to sleep. The time for each feeding should usually not exceed fifteen minutes. According to measurement, a healthy breastfed infant has already obtained at least three-quarters of its required milk volume within the first eight to ten minutes of breastfeeding, and the remaining one-quarter in the next five minutes. After each breastfeeding, the nipple and areola should be wiped clean with cotton gauze or cotton, and covered with a clean piece of cloth. To make the nipples smooth and prevent chapping, a small amount of petroleum jelly or lanolin can be applied to the nipples, and washed off with warm water before the next breastfeeding.</p>
<p>As for the breastfeeding period for infants, it is best to breastfeed until ten months. After one year, the mother's milk is not only insufficient for the infant's food needs, but also loses its nourishing effect, so breastfeeding must be stopped immediately. However, weaning should be implemented gradually and not abruptly, to prevent complications in the breastfed infant. If the mother is pregnant, then breastfeeding must be stopped, because the mother's milk is not enough for both the infant inside and outside the womb.</p>
<p>The above is about the method of breastfeeding for mothers. If the mother is unable to breastfeed the infant herself and must hire a wet nurse, then great care should be taken in the selection of the wet nurse. Even from the mother's personal convenience, hiring a wet nurse also involves many troubles. Before hiring, the wet nurse's health must be checked, and after hiring, it must be examined whether the infant's breastfeeding is appropriate.</p>
<p>The wet nurse's physique and blood must first be examined by a doctor. If proven qualified, then she can be hired. Because the wet nurse's milk is often not suitable for the infant, and if the wet nurse has a venereal disease, it is even more dangerous. Therefore, if she is not examined and casually hired to breastfeed, it will be detrimental to the infant's health. One more thing to pay attention to is that the wet nurse's infant should be about the same age as one's own infant. If they are too far apart, the milk may not be very suitable for the infant.</p>
<p>As for feeding cow's milk, attention must be paid to its cleanliness, and the ingredients fed must also be gradually increased according to the infant's age. There are three common types of using condensed milk to replace cow's milk: (A) containing milk whey and added sugar, (B) containing milk whey but no added sugar, and (C) with milk whey removed. Ultimately, its composition is similar to cow's milk, and no one type can be called a completely suitable food. Only the first two types can be used as part of the food for infants over six months old (those with milk whey removed are still unsuitable). Milk powder is really not easy to digest for infants under six months old, and forced feeding can easily cause illness. According to the experiments of doctors, infants after seven months can start using powder food for nourishment. Also, goat milk is also a very good nutrient for infants, and goats do not suffer from lung stimulant diseases, which makes it more beneficial than cow's milk.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about supplementary foods for infants. After four or five months, in addition to breastfeeding, infants should also be given some vegetable juice, such as orange juice, every day. This kind of fruit juice should be diluted with boiled water. When squeezing oranges, hands must be washed clean to avoid contamination. As for infants after six or seven months, a little food can be added for them to eat. Infant food must be tender and easy to digest, and should be cooked until soft and hot before being given to them. The best vegetables for infants are spinach, turnips, sweet potatoes, and cabbage. However, these vegetables should not be cooked with oil, only a little salt is needed. Infants of ten months can be given thin porridge once a day, and noodles are also acceptable.</p>
<p>In addition, for raising infants, the following must be noted. Infants should have sufficient sleep, and it is best to let infants sleep on their own to avoid being disturbed. Also, infants must be bathed daily, and clothing and diapers must be washed and changed frequently to maintain cleanliness. It is also necessary to weigh the infant regularly, because the increase or decrease in weight is closely related to the infant's health. Most importantly, infants should not be allowed to be near patients, because infants have very weak constitutions and are easily infected with diseases.</p>
<p>All of the above are things that mothers must pay attention to. In short, for a mother to raise an infant, if she can do it according to the above methods, it will definitely be very beneficial to the health of the infant's body.</p>
<h3>Summer Nourishment of the Heart</h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>Nourishing the heart and cultivating the character is originally a very good thing, and it is even more suitable in summer. As the saying goes, "A calm heart naturally feels cool," so why not engage in the work of nourishing the heart? Below are maxims about nourishing the heart:</p>
<p>If the heart has principles, it will not be confused by heresies and miscellaneous sayings. If the heart has established knowledge, it will not be swayed by vulgar and shallow views.</p>
<p>The heart should not be narrow-minded. A narrow-minded heart invites much regret. The heart should not be procrastinating. A procrastinating heart thwarts many heroes.</p>
<p>The human heart values smallness. A small heart can accommodate the world. The human heart needs emptiness. An empty heart can embrace the world.</p>
<p>The heart of a sage is upright, grand, and luminous. The heart of a virtuous person is solemn and vigilant. The heart of the masses is humble, vulgar, and narrow-minded. The heart of a petty person is treacherous, cunning, and changeable.</p>
<p>The four words "respect, reverence, humility, and yielding" are the good of the heart, through which true nature can be seen. The four words "familiarity, contempt, arrogance, and negligence" are the evil of the heart, through which the conscience is obscured.</p>
<p>Everyone uses their heart, but fears using it for evil purposes. Everyone creates their heart, but fears creating an evil environment.</p>
<p>The heart is like a horse running on a plain, easy to release but difficult to restrain.</p>
<p>The heart is a god. Those who deceive their heart inevitably deceive the gods. The god is the heart. Those who deceive the gods inevitably deceive themselves.</p>
<p>An empty heart can respond to the affairs of the world. A selfless heart can convince the people of the world. An upright heart can subdue the things of the world. A clear heart can understand the principles of the world.</p>
<p>Once the heart is cold, the lively scenery cannot enter. Once the heart is detached, the glamorous objects cannot move it.</p>
<p>The human heart fears darkness. Mistakes should be corrected by calming the mind. When the mind is settled, one will gradually feel clarity.</p>
<p>The human heart must have city walls. If the heart has city walls, it will not go out. The mouth must have doors. If the mouth has doors, it will not be unrestrained.</p>
<p>The heart of a young person should be reserved and restrained, not unrestrained. The heart of an old person should be unrestrained, not suppressed.</p>
<h3>One Gain from Household Affairs</h3>
<p>Removing rust from kitchen knives: Immerse in swill water for one or two days, then take out, and the rust will be removed by itself.</p>
<p>Mending woks: If there is a hole in the wok, mash raw pig liver and apply it, which is no different from mending with iron.</p>
<p>Porridge: When cooking porridge from rice, add a spoonful of lemon juice to make the color pure white and the aroma strong.</p>
<p>White rice: When cooking rice, you can also add a little lemon juice to the water, which will make the rice cleaner, whiter, and fluffier.</p>
<p>Cold rice: In summer, spread fresh amaranth or fresh lotus leaves on cold rice, so it will not spoil overnight.</p>
<p>Washing glass bottles: Do not discard eggshells. Crush them into pieces and use them to wash glass bottles, without the need for laborious picking, and able to scrape away dirt and polish.</p>

<h3>The Foundation for Success in Career</h3>
<p>— Piaoping</p>
<p>Little friends! You are now in the time of study. When you grow up in the future, you must come to society to do something. Doing business requires a good foundation of knowledge and morality. The more deeply rooted the foundation is, the greater the hope of success in the future. So when we are laying the foundation, do we want to make it stronger and deeper? If we don't lay the foundation now, then it will probably be too late to lay it when we grow up. So now I would like to discuss with you the basic conditions for laying the foundation:</p>
<p>1.  Manners: Manners include respect, dignity, and neatness. Whether it is to superiors or inferiors, to the poor or the rich, you must have the same manners.</p>
<p>2.  Loyalty: Loyalty means not being hypocritical, not perfunctory, and not forgetting your roots. Treat people with loyalty and speak honestly.</p>
<p>3.  Humility: In everything, you must be cautious. If you only know a little and act rashly, it is easy to fail. You should study more, ask for advice diligently, and always keep a little "humility," and doing things will be much easier. 4. Endurance of hardship: Having the spirit of hard work and endurance is a great "capital" for reading and doing things.</p>
<p>4.  Persistence: In addition to enduring hardship, you must also have perseverance. It is most taboo to start things and not finish them, and to be inconsistent.</p>
<p>5.  Enterprising: In the past, people in our country mostly advocated conservatism and did not know how to be enterprising. Therefore, the development of all industries has fallen behind others. In this great era, we must have the spirit of seeking progress in everything.</p>
<h3>Health Exercise Method (3)</h3>
<p>There are a total of twenty-seven types of Mc's health exercises, with one to nine as the first group, which will be completed in this issue. The second group will be published in the next issue (i.e., the tenth to the nineteenth style and the third group (i.e., the twentieth to the twenty-seventh style).</p>
<p>When practicing, in the first week, you should complete the first group every day. In the second week, you should do from the first style to the nineteenth style every day, that is, combine the first and second groups. In the third week, you must complete the whole set, that is, from the first to the twenty-seventh. However, according to this method, if you feel that you are not very proficient in a certain style, or that it is a bit laborious, it is better to adopt a gradual approach, and never practice beyond your physical strength, because "gradual" is really a stable and effective method. Although its progress is relatively slow, its effect is the same as that of people who progress quickly. Therefore, people with poor physical strength should not rush to do the latter style before they have mastered the previous one.</p>
<p>Health exercise is a good exercise suitable for every member of the family. Once started, it should be treated as a daily homework, and it cannot be interrupted for a day. When doing it, it is certainly not appropriate to practice excessively, but for some seemingly simple and easy styles, do not lightly ignore them, because this simple style may be part of its characteristics. As for sweating from exercise or gymnastics, it has long been generally recognized as beneficial to health. Therefore, if you feel that sweating is not very pleasant when doing health exercises, you may wish to look at the climate and wear more clothes to help with sweating, but you must know that exercise is more important than sweating, so whether sweating is pleasant is a secondary issue!</p>
<p>(Figure 7) Lie flat on your body, stretch your arms over your head, put your palms together, as shown in the picture, lift your upper body, make a sitting posture, do not bend your knees, try to touch your toes with your fingertips, repeat six times. The count should be based on each time the fingertips touch the toes. This is an old-fashioned method, but it is still one of the most beneficial exercises for the body, because its effect directly reaches the abdominal muscles and internal organs. It can be said to be one of the most effective standard exercises for restraining the abdomen and preventing it from becoming a protruding belly.</p>
<p>(Figure 8) Lie flat on your body, stretch your arms and legs straight, put your palms together, lift your feet, as shown in the picture, open your arms and legs and return to the original state, repeat six times. The count should be based on each time the arms and legs are closed. When doing it for the first time, it should be a little slow, and the arms and legs should be opened as much as possible before closing them. This allows the buttocks, shoulders, and thighs to have a balanced opportunity to move, and the chest can be expanded to increase its breathing volume.</p>
<p>(Figure 9) Lie flat on your body, stretch your arms and legs straight, put your palms together, lift your feet, as in Figure 8, cross your arms and legs, first with the right arm and right leg on top, then switch to the left arm and left leg, rotate six times, the count should be based on each time the right arm and right leg are on top.</p>
<p>According to the flat style principle and purpose, it is the same as the eighth style, but the movements are opposite, so that the same muscle tendon is extended on the opposite side. Just practice skillfully, it is very helpful for the overall balanced development and blood circulation. The movements of this style and the eighth style should be slow and orderly, and do not use excessive force. (End of the first group)</p>
<h3>One Issue of Regular Star Family Dishes</h3>
<p>— Hua Yingnv Shi</p>
<p>The weather is too hot, always above ninety degrees every day. Some families, as usual, want to eat vegetarian food in June. Although there is no lack of superstitious meaning of gods and Buddhas in it, it is also in line with the principles of economy and hygiene. It is worth promoting. Winter melon soup has always been the most fashionable delicacy in summer, but chicken, duck, fish, and meat are inevitably too expensive. It costs a lot to eat a winter melon soup. Why not have a vegetarian one? Fortunately, ingredients such as sharp bamboo shoots, fragrant mushrooms, pickled mustard greens, green vegetables, green peppers, Beijing pickled mustard greens, and Sichuan pickled mustard greens can all be accommodated. As long as the seasoning is proper, it is also delicious and palatable.</p>

<h3>A Vanity-Loving Fiancée</h3>
<p>— Lu</p>
<p>Dear Editor: It was the strict order of my parents, and also with my consent, that I got engaged to her. She has a clever tongue and a generous demeanor, and even more so a pleasing face. She can make gloomy people smile again. However, from my observation, from the words of third parties, I know that she loves vanity. She once did not speak to her mother for a week because her mother did not make her new clothes. She once did not go to class because she did not have a handbag. She once sold her ring to treat her classmates to dinner. This is such a terrible event. If her degree of vanity increases with time, then what extent will she reach after we get married? Will she quarrel with me over making new quilts? Will she be unhappy with me over buying silk fabrics? Will she...? I dare not think about these many things. The time to leave the wedding is getting closer and closer. I don't know if her vanity will disappear because she leaves school, or if it will be destroyed because of marriage. I really don't know how to deal with it.</p>
<p>Lu: Your fiancée's vanity may be due to being pampered at home, or to the fact that her companions' actions are too focused on luxury. It is impossible to hope that her vanity will be destroyed immediately after she gets married. This can only be gradually done to prevent her from having a baseless impression. Don't be discouraged, don't be disappointed. If you have deep love, correct her personality, but it must not be done too hastily, so as not to backfire. Editor</p>

<h3>Public Bonds Gradually Show Signs of Recovery</h3>
<p>Yesterday's dark market for public bonds showed a slight rebound after a long period of fatigue. This was due to the exhaustion of floating positions, some short covering, and the emergence of new long positions. Market prices immediately rose, and the long-dormant situation saw a slight awakening. The trend also gradually shows signs of excitement, with the usual pattern of a surge on rises and a gradual decline on falls. The prospect is that public bonds may be exempt from the case of control, and continued rises are also expected. Although trading was not high yesterday, market prices gradually rose, and the results all rose by 50 cents to 1.20 yuan, with a transaction volume of about 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<h3>The Rise of Electrical Stocks Has Slightly Stabilized</h3>
<p>Yesterday's stock market in China showed steady progress. New pharmaceutical and cultural stocks rose. The recently soaring Hebei Water and Electricity and Huashang Electrical stocks turned weak, and the same was true for the stability of the department store industry. Speculators' funds have been transferred to legitimate investments. The prices of each stock are more likely to rise and difficult to fall. The prices of each stock market are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Jewelry Gold and Silver Remain Unchanged</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the exchange price of gold jewelry in the Da Xin industry in this city was still listed at 2,400 yuan per tael (the purchase price was reduced by more than 300 yuan), and there was no change. The price for inter-industry transactions was slightly higher, at between 2,130 yuan per tael. However, there was trading but no market. The listed price of silver jewelry was 17 yuan per tael, and there was no change. The price for inter-industry transactions was generally 12.56 yuan.</p>
<h3>Jiading Daxin Two Bank Notes Agent Exchange</h3>
<p>The Banking Industry Joint Preparatory Committee of this city issued a circular to each bank and bank yesterday, stating that it has been scheduled to be on July 11-12 of the thirty-first year (next Monday). The committee will start to act as an agent for the exchange of notes of Jiading Bank and Daxin Bank. The exchange code of Jiading Bank is designated as 52/3, and the exchange code of Daxin Bank is designated as 52/4.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Tickets Again Used for Cigarette Payment</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the call rate of the Money Industry Association was 15 points. Newly drawn head bills were still exchanged at par with cash. The payment of the Japanese military tickets for oil and sugar has not yet ended. The payment of cigarettes in the cigarette exchange industry has also started, causing the market price to continue to rise. The inter-industry exchange price was first 5.56 yuan, then 5.57 yuan, and then rose by 1.4 cents. The money exchange industry and silver number retail outlets sold for 5.58-5.59 yuan and purchased for 5.55 yuan, also rising by more than one point.</p>
<h3>Edible Oil Raw Materials Gradually Arriving</h3>
<p>The raw materials for manufacturing edible oil are now being shipped to Shanghai in a steady stream. Recently, 3,000 packages of raw peanuts have been shipped. There are also soybeans, rapeseed, and cottonseed, which are also continuing to arrive in Shanghai. Therefore, the output of this factory is increasing day by day. The wholesale department of the edible oil industry distributes about 1,000 dan per day, which is more than enough to supply the city's consumption. However, recently, a group of speculators have secretly raised prices for sale. I hope that citizens will not be fooled by them. If there are users who need more, they can directly request to purchase from the edible oil office in the Enterprise Building.</p>
<h3>Dried Sweet Potatoes Not Actively Sold</h3>
<p>A small amount of dried sweet potatoes has arrived. Although the actual sales are not active, the market situation is still stable. It is estimated that 30 packages of dried sweet potatoes from Qingdao are priced at 117 yuan, and 25 packages of dried sweet potatoes from Jiangbei are priced at 104 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Soybean Cake Market Is Quiet</h3>
<p>The soybean trade turned quiet again yesterday. Only ten bags of Benniu red beans were traded, priced at 130 yuan. The potential is still firm.</p>
<p>The sales of soybean cake are mediocre. The owners of the goods are still determined to sell, so the situation is tight. It is estimated that 500 pieces of new Lizi cake for May are priced at 57.5 yuan, 300 pieces of old Xingji cake for June are priced at 51.5 yuan, and 1,000 pieces of new cake for May are priced at 59 yuan to 58.9 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Cloth Industry Is Watching and Trading Is Sparse</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market was quiet due to the wait-and-see attitude of both buyers and sellers. The trading was sparse and the market showed no signs of improvement. The closing price of 12-pound Nengtou fine cloth new orders was 194.5 yuan, bank orders were 168.5 yuan, Caiqiu fine cloth was trading at 176 yuan, and Sijunzi Bilji red orders were 7.54 yuan. The factory cloth transaction was even more idle. 16-pound Earth coarse cloth was 185 yuan, and Xiahong was 182 yuan. Changshoufu silk was 6.25 yuan and had a transaction. Biyushu Xiang was 6.2 yuan, Qin Liangyu bleached cloth was 160 yuan, Xiaoji Shilin was 265 yuan, Qin Meiren grey cloth was 238 yuan, and Taohua NV Shilin was last priced at 278 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Factory's Woolen Fabrics Are Unique in the Market</h3>
<p>Imported woolen fabrics have been in short supply since the European War, and were completely cut off when the Pacific War broke out. The only products circulating in the market are those produced by this factory. Later, due to the shortage of raw materials, high prices, and rising water and electricity costs, production was restricted, and the production volume also decreased. However, looking at the buying and selling in the market, 70-80% are products of this factory, which occupies the most advantageous position. Broadly speaking, it can be divided into three major systems: British-owned Yihua Factory, with the largest scope and the most products, has now been taken over; Japanese-owned Yongxing Hongkang, Shanghai, and Gongda, etc.; Chinese-owned Zhanghua, Xiexin, Yinfeng, Weiyi, Dalong, Hualun, Yuanfeng, Deda, Runfeng, Dalu, Daguangming, etc., and Baoxin, Lianxin, Gongping, Hongsheng, Datong, Baochang, Rentai, Shanghai, Yousheng, and Gongsheng, etc., which are used for weaving yarn and lining suits.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Business News</h3>
<p>Raw Sugar Stock Steady, Red Sugar Untraded: Yesterday, the sugar merchants' cooperative business office's sugar stock and the guild's transactions remained sparse and the market remained stable. Initially, it rose by half a dollar, but then returned to level, resulting in no rise or fall. Raw sugar stock opened at $317.50 and closed at $317, with approximately 400 bags traded. Red sugar stock was mutually shunned and no trades were made.</p>
<p>Black Leaf Litchi Newly Arrived, Seventy Crates: The first batch of Guangdong black leaf litchi, totaling more than seventy crates, has arrived at Fushang and other firms in the North Market. This year's yield is excellent, with both appearance and color being superior, comparable to Jinshan litchi. However, there are occasional burnt particles in the flesh, due to over-roasting, which is not a serious problem. Yesterday, sales commenced, with round litchi priced at $800 and flat litchi at $850.</p>
<p>First Batch of New Dried Vegetables Arrives in Nanjing and Zhenjiang: The first batch of new dried vegetables, according to telegrams from Nanjing and Zhenjiang, has arrived in small quantities. Dried vegetables from Xuzhou opened at $380 in the Beijing market, while those from Huaibei opened at $420 to $400 in the Zhenjiang market, with the next grade at $380. Prices are generally stable. It is noted that the original products all require sorting and culling, and as existing stock is not moving, merchants here have little interest. Therefore, the initial market price of new dried vegetables will not be excessively high.</p>
<p>Alisma Rhizome Expensive, Costs High: Stocks of alisma rhizome in the market are very scarce. It is heard that the Jianbang firm has transported dozens of packages, including large and small grains, as well as double blooms. Due to high transportation costs, the cost is not low, so the opening price is higher than the market price, resulting in no transactions.</p>
<p>Cigarette Inventory Abundant, Floating Traders Selling Off: The cigarette market continues to be weak, with sales to customers and within the industry remaining smooth. Due to abundant inventory, floating traders are selling off, so the market sentiment is more inclined towards selling than buying. Yesterday, Grandee brand opened at $8550, Old Sword brand at $5300, and Pin Hai brand at $4600, all down by $100. Miscellaneous brands were at $3650, and Wu Hua brand at $3550, holding steady. Japanese cigarettes, Golden Gun brand, slightly improved, priced at $1370; Golden Mansion at $1950; Red Rose at $2000; Total Luck brand at $1700; and Compass brand at $1150, all showing a downward trend compared to the previous day. Domestic cigarettes, Golden Rat brand at $1500, Beauty brand at $2900, and Pyramid at $2900, showed slight variations.</p>
