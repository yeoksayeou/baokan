<p>— 鐵明</p>
<p>我最不怕說話。無論什麼語言—國語，廣東話，英文—我學到一分就要用三分。人家以為我有舉習語言的天才；其實呢，不過臉皮老胆子大而已。學習語言就祇要這兩種本事。</p>
<p>到歐洲以來很感覺到英文在大陸上行不通，非多學些法文和德文不可。德文我巳懂些，勉强彀用；所以一有機會，我就儘量增進我的法文。</p>
<p>我的法文程度當然很淺。動詞的格式多得使我頭痛；名詞的陰陽性完全無理可喻，而且常常和德文相反。可是我不管這些，每次一到法國就橫七豎八的亂說，說不明白的時候就儘量使用法國人最通行的手勢，幸虧法國人根本就比英國人的態度好，他們看見一個外國人法文說得不好，非但不討厭，反而非常同情，把說不消楚的話都體會出來了。</p>
<p>在巴黎時我認識了老同事章技正的一個本家。他是研究政治學的，老巴黎。一次生，兩次熱；我和他不久就很投機了。他勸我在巴黎大學的「中國學術講座」演講幾次·據他說這種演講不大我得到適當的講師，至少近幾年來不會聽說有中國的大學敎授來担任過演講。</p>
<p>好吧！演講不算難事，做了十幾年的敎授還怕幾次學術演講嗎？法文不好，也不礙事，反正法國人很能領悟—而且最奧妙的道理本是只可以意會，不可以言傳的。</p>
<p>在法國演講眞是一件頂有價値的事：對於中國可以說是一棬教睦邦交溝通文化的工作。我打算講些理論化學上的問題，因為啦比較最有研究的農業化學，地方性太大，不宜作為這種演講的題材。法國的理論化學家吿訴我許多聞所未聞的新發現。這，到德國去就得不到這樣的好處了。德國人最用功，無論用什麼文字發表的報吿他們全都讀過；而他們刋物上的文章也足以包括他們的全部研究工作而有餘。所以到德國去講學，你旣不能吿訴他們什麼，他們也沒有什麼新奇的工作可以吿訴你。在法國則不然，他們對於別國的研究往往非常隔膜，而你正以為法國科學落後毫無新的進步的時候，常會異軍突起，一個沒有名望的法國人—有時而且是法國女人—剛剛發現了最新奇的足以驚天動地的學理。放射作用就是一個極好的例子，還有波力學；這樣一個最新的學理非但使愛因斯坦敎授的相對論相對地簡單粗淺得如同兒戲了，而且竟在無意之中把友琴葛樂華（Eugene　Galois）放逐到魔鬼島上去，而把我—我倒希望—送進了盎貝爾（Ambert）的地方監獄。</p>
<p>我本來想把這篇實錄在中國化學雜誌上發表，那麼這一大段「緣起」就可以刪掉了。但是本雜誌的讀者一定要問我，六月二十八日那天夜裏十一點鐘我在居雅路（Rue　Cuyas）做些什麼？那偭沒有門牙的人又怎會認識我的？而我怎樣也懂得一些波力學對於化學的關係？沙蓬（Sorbonne）附近掛着許多我在巴黎大學演講的佈吿。最新一期圖畫週報（Llllusrtation）中也登了一張我的相片，下面還註着一段似是而非的履歷。那天，是我最後一次演講了。在講完之後坐在聖密現蔭道（Bonlevard　St.　Miehel）和學校路（Rue　des　Ecoles）轉角上的蘇茀萊咖啡館（CafesSoufflet）裏和法國的同行喝了許多啤酒，同塵有著名化學家恩利奧（Henriot）夫婦。後面一副座頭上是他們一個門生和一個年輕女子在打紙脾。這種情形，莫說在眞茹江灣學府的小吃店裏找不出，我在美國的時候正碰到禁酒，當然不能相比，就是在喝酒風氣盛行的牛津劍橋我也沒有見到過。</p>
<p>那個沒有門牙的人身上穿得異常襤褸，面有饑色。巴黎人大都有工作可做，這樣潦倒的人是很少見的。他一步一步挨近我身邊，向我說道，「請看這個。倘你想再多知道一些，請跟我來。」他說完了就縮到門邊暗角裏去。我那時弄得莫名其妙，把他塞在我手邊的那張紙看了一看，咦！那不是碳質波力方程式的一部份嗎？我記得碳質似乎有四十二個聯立波偏微方程式。倘有人能解答這些方程式，就不難澈底明白這原素所有的隱性了。一個乞丐也許會抄了些古怪東西來做招搖撞騙的幌子，但是這個人倒不像，因為所寫的幾個方程式非但字跡淸秀符號不錯，而且我相信那幾個完全新的排列式都還沒有發表過。</p>
<p>我生平沒有什麼特別的嗜好，就只是好奇。無論什麼新奇的東西我全都希望知道一點究竟，而我對於理論化學比較地還能懂得一點也是受了這好奇心的賞賜。那時我的好奇心不由勃發，站起身來走到那人旁邊。他等我走近了，很低聲說道：「正夜半，到維延德門（Portedela　Villette）進步酒店（Bar　duProgres）來林聲音顫動着，可見他正懷着極大的恐懼，同時還做了一個手勢，叫我快快走開。</p>
<p>那時離半夜還有一個鐘頭。看着道種情形，我料着必有什麼古怪事情發生。我倒並不胆怯，反正一個窮光蛋，只是我也不得不做一些必要的準備，尤其是身在異國。那是我向恩利奧等人吿辭出來，先很小心看見沒有人監視着我，就很快地走進大哥咖啡館（Cafed　Earcourt），在喝咖啡的當兒，寫了一張明信片給我的朋友章先生—巴黎的咖啡館大都代售郵要明信片，而門口就有郵箱，這種制度眞給了我不少便利—大略說明那夜的情形，叫他在下一天中午打電話給我；倘使我還沒有回去呢，請他立刻報吿警察。這張明信片是用中文寫的，所以倒可避免別人偷讀。</p>
<p>我走進地道去坐地底電車。維延德門在巴黎東北角裏，我會在那邊參觀過一個屠宰傷。我在車上竭力自己鎮定自己，但是我想一個很注意的人也許仍舊可以看出我慌張的神色。</p>
<p>進步酒店是一家很小很黯的酒店，內部和巴黎幾千家別的小酒店完全一樣，有那很長的櫃檯，櫃檯後面一個胖胖的老　娘，老　娘背後是各式各樣的酒瓶。在角角裏有一張小座頭，只有兩個座位，正對着門，可以看見門口一切的動靜。我就去佔了這倘座頭，叫了一杯可奈酒。還時候若在蒙馬說（Montmartre）一帶，正是歌高酒酣的時候，可是在這冷落地方的小酒店裹，除了我之外只有一個運貨汽車的司機在那裏指手劃脚吿訴老闆娘怎樣他的車子被別人鐘了。巴黎的汽車照例是橫衝直撞毫不客氣的，使初到巴黎來的乘客禁不住毫毛直豎。闖禍的次數倒也幷不太多，但是一經互撞，究竟有沒有對的一方面，就很成問題啦！這個司機也正在把一切錯處和罪名完全推在對方身上，還嘰咕着因此把他陲眠的時　都弄得遲了許多。</p>
<p>鐘正打着十二下，居雅路那個朋友來了，一聲不響坐在我對面。我替他也叫了一杯可奈酒，而且在一個錄頭裏又添了好幾杯。他缺少的門牙只是他很大的創傷中的一部份。這時候我看淸楚了，他面上的疤是一個老疤，也許還是上次歐戰的紀念。他很急很低說了約莫一個鐘頭，大半用的是不很標準有重音的鄕下法文。他雖竭力用普通的字和簡單的句法，我聽着仍舊十分費力，所以在重要的地方他還添上幾個英文字，而且還夾雜用了許多德文的科學術語。</p>
<p>他的神情很不自然，顯然是懷着很大的恐怖，但看上去好像他的恐怖已習慣成了自然，是一種長期危險所造成的現象。</p>
<p>我們談話的大概是這樣的—我相信我所記得的不至於有重大的錯誤：</p>
<p>「你知道友琴葛樂華的事嗎？」</p>
<p>「我聽說他犯了殺人罪，充軍到魔鬼島上去了。但我不信一個大數學家會利令智昏到謀財害命殺死朋友的。不是他們有人想提起復訴嗎？如果我有可以效勞的地方，我是樂於遵命的。」</p>
<p>「很好，不過太遲了！他上月已死了。那邊好幾個囚犯養着鸚鵡玩，一時起了瘟疫，可怕的然帶鸚鵡病竟傳染了他。因為他死了我繼吿訴你的。兀特發明蒸汽機以來，沒有比他更偉大的發明了，而他的被害，就是因為他所知太多。你等我講完了之後，也許會變成世界上第一富人，但是也就有被暗殺的資格了。只要有人看見你同我在一處，說不定立刻就會有危險可以發生。你倘害怕，我們最好走開。」</p>

<h3 id="c30">一年一度天河會 <a href="#c30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>人間多嘉伉儷，天上豈無情侶，此七夕牛郎織女會天河之神話所由來也。</p>
<p>故老相傳，牛郎織女隔天河相處，（以其星霧光色若銀，亦稱銀河）可望不可即，神鵲以翼相遮成橋，於七月七日之夕，作一年一度之相會。荊楚歲時記亦謂「七月七日，牽牛織女會天河」。按荊楚歲時記為梁宗懍選，宗為楚人，所記自為荊楚間事。前乎梁則如魏文帝秋風燕歌行，亦有詠其事。</p>
<p>「秋風蕭瑟天氣凉，草木搖落露為霜。羣燕辭歸鵲南翔，念君客游多思腸。慊慊思歸戀故鄕，君何奄留寄他力。賤妾煢勞守空房，憂來思君不敢忘·不覺淚下沾衣裳，援瑟鳴弦發淸商。短歌微吟不能長，明月皎皎照我床。星漢西流夜未央，牽斗織女遙相望，爾獨何辜限河梁」此空閨少婦動秋思，亦有感於「牽牛織女遙相望」；則知七夕相會，欲以彌補天上情侶之缺憾，巳在漢魏問。</p>
<p>漫話牽牛織女星</p>
<p>牽牛織女二星，何以必待七夕而始相會，此叉為星度運行關係。蓋時正秋初，炎威未消，仰望天空，銀漢漫漫，蜿蜓如河，雙星遙對，晶瑩耀目，焉得不動人遐思，起人注意，而造作神話，以人間擬天上，亦是人類常有之思致。</p>
<p>星漢牽牛織女之為名，由來己古，詩小雅大東章云：「維天有漢，監亦有光；跂彼識女，終日七襄：雖則七襄，不成報章，院彼牽牛，不以服箱</p>
<p>史記漢書均有其說，漢書云：「南斗為廟，其北建星，建星者，旗也。牽牛為犧牲。其北河鼓；大星，上將：左，左將；右，右將。其北織女，織女，天女孫也」。</p>
<p>晋書所言較詳，茲述其要：「織女三星，在天紀棄端，天女也：主果蓏絲帛珍寶也一。「河鼓三星，在牽牛北，天鼓也，主軍政，中鈇鋮。一日三武，主天子三將軍一。「牽牛六星，天之關梁，主犧牲事「織女星，即今天琴座之主星也。必待斗柄南指（此指北斗言），視之若在頂上，此即夏秋六七月光景。牛郎一星，叫有兩說，一即以二十八宿中之牛宿當之，所謂牽牛六星是也。一即以河鼓當之，屬天鷹座，與織女星隔河相處，幾成一直錢。河鼓俗稱偏担星，籌左右兩星，中間一星，有似挑物之扁担然。牽牛屬於摩羯座，南斗屬於人馬座，均為黃道十二宿之一。</p>
<p>古人稱牛斗即指此。如蘇東坡赤壁賦云：「少焉月出於東山之上，徘徊於牛斗之間」的是七月旣望夜間景色。又滕王閣賦：「物華天寶，龍光射牛斗之墟。」以牛斗皆為南力之星宿，古以稱今之汀西省境，即如晋代所謂之豫章豐城諸地，而為牛斗夕墟也。</p>
<p>乞巧由來重針綫</p>
<p>以七夕而乞巧，始於何時，余讀書少，未得其詳。但荊楚歲時記旣有其說，則知梁朝已盛行也。其說有云：「七月七日，牽牛織女會天河，人家婦女結綵縷，穿七孔針，以乞巧：，有嬉子網於瓜上，則以為得。」</p>
<p>以織女之為織，故乞巧亦為婦女針業事，於七日之夕行之。七夕正與上弦相近，月光猶未皎明，能於月下穿七孔針，必目力勝常·而針業織巧工細，端賴目力，故競以相尚，此崔灝詩所以有「長安城中月如練，家家此夜持針綫」之句也。舊時騐目力優劣有二，一即月下穿針，一即北斗第六星開陽為雙星，其旁有一小星，能見之者必目力强。</p>
<p>嬉子者，即長脚小蜘蛛也·有謂見其引絲下垂必有喜，遂名為嬉蛛。七夕陳瓜果於庭以乞巧，有遇嬉蛛結網以為得巧，此在夏令亦至可能也。</p>
<p>帝京景物略，則謂於日間映針於水，以其形夕織巨為得巧。其說有云：「七月七日之午，丟巧針，婦女曝盎水日中，頃之，水面生膜，繡針投之則浮，則看水底針影，有成雲物花類，烏獸影者，有成鞋及剪刀水茄影者，謂乞得巧。」</p>
<p>按水自有其張力，投針於水，藉光綫反映，為形不一，非待日曝而後生膜　亦有以盌盛水，中沒鳳仙花葉，七夕露一宵。翌晨投以針。針影粗者為拙，織者為巧。</p>
<p>余嘗疑牛郎織女之說，旣見於魏，則乞巧亦疑與之相前後，或即本於鍼神。蓋魏文帝美人薛靈芸，能刺繡，雖處深幛，不舉燭，亦裁製立成，宮中號為鍼神。遂致婦女聞風傚尤，以為美談，而於七夕月下引針乞巧，安知非即靈芸所啟誘也。</p>
<p>七月七日長生殿</p>
<p>自從白居易長恨歌，膾炙人口，於是「七月七日長生殿，夜半無人私語時，在天願作比翼烏，在地願為連理枝，天長地久有時盡，此恨綿綿無盡期。」</p>
<p>耳熟能詳。好似七夕天河會，不但天上有如此一回事；即人間亦情切切，意綿綿，緾個不休。若談到情，就會發生許多弄巧成拙，弄假成眞，本是情之至，却成怨之府，顚倒錯亂，痴心妄想，有非理智所能制，言語所能盡：所以憤情之徒，倒不如牽牛織女，兩地相思言不盡，別時容易見時難之為愈。如果能精靈相通，正何必有長生殿馬嵬坡這類悲歡離合之事。是以杜甫有詩咏牽牛織女云：「牽牛出河西，織女出其東，萬古永相望，七夕誰見同，神光竟難候，此事終矇矓，颯然精靈合，何必秋遂通。」</p>
<p>天上人間兩相同</p>
<p>威震絕域遂以漢族成名之漢武帝，以七月七日平旦生。拓拔魏首先稱帝之道武帝珪，亦生於七月七日：韋初牛體　倍於常兒，藏胞之坎生榆，後遂成林。但帝中中亦有於七月七日死者，如六朝之宋後廢帝，及巴陵王休若，然皆被殺，不得其死，更有七月七日生，亦以七月七日死者，如唐宰相喬琳。朱泚亂，琳屈身於沘，及收復京師，琳以故宰相，失節背義，雖老不赦。琳臨刑歎日：「我以七月七日生，以此日死，非命耶！」</p>
<p>要之，一切神話，無一非從人情臆造而來，託之於神，寄之於靈。以「南斗為廟」，遂以「牽生為犧牲」。以銀漢為河，而以天津九星為津梁。人情孰不願「有情人都成了眷屬」，遂揑造萬古不變之牽牛織女星，於七月七日一度相會。向以男耕女織，為里農主義之中國，人生應有之義，乃謂天上織女牛郎，亦事耕織。又以星形如梭，名之為織女；西人則以為狀似提琴，而名之為天琴。可知一切境界，皆由心造，天上人間兩相同，無人何謂天，無心何謂人，古往今來萬般事，皆　作如是觀。是則余今日所寫七夕乞巧，亦為多事矣！雖然，以消永畫，以逍炎暑，於煩惱中覓淸凉，固亦樂在其中也。</p>

<p>中國靑年團團長錢旦、應橫山報道部長之邀請、於昨晚十時二十五分在大上海放送局廣播、茲將演詞錄後、</p>
<p>自八一三事變以來、到現在已鏗整整的五個足年了、上海民衆由戰爭所受的痛苦、眞是一言難盡、解除這種痛苦的唯一途徑、只有和平、</p>
<p>我們理想的目的、當然是全面和平、不過全面和平、不是一朝一夕所能達到的、全面和平須從局部和平做起、而局部和平、尤當從安定社會民生着手、怎麼才能實現局部和平呢、我以為負起和平工作的人、祗有純潔的靑年才能勝仟、所以必須先從訓練靑年着手、可是訓練靑年的對象、應從學生靑年着手、還是從職業靑年着手呢、這確是値得檢討的問題、據我的觀察、在中國目前的環境、如欲訓練靑年、應從已入社會的靑年着手、我們不存即刻達到全面和平的奢望、我們希望先有局部和平、現在本團啊作即開始局部和平、我們在開始上海的局部和平、那末怎樣開始這局部和平的工作呢、我以為有四點、　對日本之認識、　社會進、　正常思想之訓練、</p>
<p>對日本之認識　我們不能在表面上看日本、我們要澈底的云認識日本、現在日本自從政府中央集權運動的開展、民間經濟統制的强化、一切政治機構的行動、逐步的進展起來、使國家有了歸一的領導、得進之於正軌、而政府以國家政治的力量來用之於解決社會民生問題、使人民得有紀律的平安的生活着、我在日本看到、日本國民在鐵一般的紀律下、在强有力的統制經濟的狀態下、其生活的嚴肅困苦、較目前中國情形、實千百倍以上、而日本國民確能在極愉快的牢氣中、處之泰　、這是什麼緣故呢、因為他們對於國家的愛護、是不惜任何犧牲的、對於國家的政策、是絕對擁護的、只有國家的强盛、是他們唯一的目的、個人自由、是在所不顧的、這就是奉公守法、嚴守紀律的精神表現、我們看到日木靑年在國家至上的意志下、那種嚴守紀律的精神、我們應該深感我國靑年同樣有訓練的必要、因之對於日本先有澈底的認識、而有所借鏡、</p>
<p>社會民生之安定如何才能使社會民生安定呢、我們知道目前中國安定社會的機構、已經破壞了、社會生產之份子、已經分散了、所以如何把生產機構恢復起來、如何把生產份子集中起來、如何把生產靑年訓練起來、確是目前幾個重要的問題、而負有安定社會使命的生產靑年的訓練工作、尤為當前的急務、因為生產界的靑年在現在的環境中、尤其是中國的國情狀况下、必須第一步着手訓練他集中他、你們試想、那些旣不能生產的父母、還能談到向不生產的子女敎育嗎、所以學界靑年的訓練、我認為尚可以切着作第二步的工作、現在日本是在協助我們做這安定社會的工作了、雖然是在協助我們、但是遇有不合我們理想的地方、我們就應當拿出大無畏的精神來力爭、因為日本並不是不接受我們主張、實在因為我們一向自憶放棄國本的立塲、不來　他們力爭、我想日本旣然愛中國、他們一定能接受我們正義的主張、最怕怕的是我們沒有主張、</p>
<p>生產機測之促進生產機能如何促進呢、我們看到八一三以後上海的生產機構、巳破壞殆盡、可是反過　講、上海商塲的存在點、僅僅只不過投機一項、因為投機的成功容易、造成了靑年們兩種壞的心理、就是僥倖心與倚賴心、上海地方、因之在許多生產界靑年共同建築墾殖下、無形中就造成了一個國際性質的投機市塲、我們應該用正常的方法來從事生產、也　是多辦實業、多辦工廠、復興農村、取消投機、摒除不台正軌的商業經營及非法買賣、然後加强統制經濟、將正常生產的收入、用之於正當之開支、這樣才能把生產機構健全起來、可是現在受戰爭的影響、僅有的一點正常生產機構、也經毀滅了、我們要復興他、促進他、唯一的辦法、就要明瞭統制經濟的有益無害、在浮面上看、人民對於統制經濟、似乎有一層東縛、實在統制的方式是具有台理的、規律的、科學化的、他可以遵生產機構得正常的發展、他還可促進政治進於正軌、</p>
<p>正常思想的訓練我們研究過去中國靑年思想訓練的方式、完全可說是受政洽家的利用、所以本團採用好的組織、摒除壞的運用方法、將還組織法變　的運用起來、成功這統一集權的組織、實行絕對服從嚴格紀律化的行動、來組織靑年、訓練靑年、我們訓練靑年的目標、有　我們要忠於國家、　我們要忠　領袖、　我們要忠於職司、　我們要有勇敢的氣槪、　我們要有勇敢的行動、　我們要有廉潔的精神、　我們要有知恥的能耐、　我們要先公後私、　我們要生活紀律化、　我們要求自力更生、</p>
<p>這負起和平使命的靑年、非有超越國家至上主義之原則下、養成有政治觀念的訓練工作、同時對社會民生有自力更生的精神、保持這個有用身體、用之於最偉大的救國途徑、「至於本團在云年和軸心國人士開始友誼上的聯絡、尤其是日本方面、對本團純粹建立在民衆立塲上的一點、予以深切的同情、他們以為民衆的思想表現、非以純民衆的團體來表現不可、尤其是靑年的組織、非由純潔而無色彩的靑年領導不可、我致力於這個運動、一年以來、費盡了無數的心血、經過了不少次堅苦的奮門、</p>
<p>這樣經過多少次的艱難困苦、但是我拿出最大無畏的精神、來　現本團的態度、終於完完全全獲得了多方的同情、現在本團不久就可以正式成立了、最近為了日本領事館與報道部多次邀請、希望我早些表明一　最嚴正的立塲、因此我今天略將我心胸所臣講的話、講給諸位聽、商業新聞</p>

<h3 id="c41">咖啡的悲劇 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— 揚子江</p>
<p>據電訊傳來的消息、巴西政府的商務部父命令毀滅咖啡七萬五千包，以防止價格的降跌。這種事情的發生，原是够驚人的新聞資料，可是時至今日，這樣慶見不鮮的人類社會中啼笑皆非的活劇，却巳被人因習見而疏淡起來了。</p>
<p>記得不久以前，本埠某咖啡館會做了「動人」的廣吿，大意是說：「滬埠舶來咖啡存量日鮮，高尚人士欲飽嘗口福，請從速光臨。」巴西把大量咖啡人為地毀減，却不得不使人們分外地表示可惜了。</p>
<p>不渦經過仔細和深刻的想像和觀察的人們，一定會理會到這樣類似的悲劇，也有在我們的附近不斷地出演·所謂高等的菜館，不是每日在把享受者酒醉飯飽後所剩下來的殘羹餘肴不惜地丟棄？在另一面，却不是有許多人連比這殘羹餘肴還要低劣的東西亦得不釗，而餓着空肚嗎？還有……</p>
<p>不想則己，一想就覺得諸似此類的實例，委實太多了！只不過日常或者因為習見或麻木的緣故，而沒有靈敏地感覺到罷了。</p>

<p>— 洛綠</p>
<p>冬是一個留得住人在屋子裏坐的季節，至少在晚上，而夏天恰是相反。雖然天色是巳在慢慢地黑下來，但是屋子裏却還是像洪爐一般，留身不得。於是一吃好晚飯「納凉」一事就成了每天所不能或缺的夏季日常生活之一了。</p>
<p>正像有些人吃飯時，習慣性地喜歡拿了飯碗東闖西走「樣，有許冬人納凉也是喜歡東跑跑西蕩蕩的，而不肯就在自己屋子的天井裏或是大門外。甚至還有人會老遠地拿了一條櫈，巴巴地趕到跑為廳的國際飯店之下，據說那裏的風比較特別大些。於是你也去，我也去，一過七點鐘，即派克路的頭上——福利公司跟二十四層大廈之下的人行道上，就早坐滿了人，一陣風來，樂得每個人的嘴都張開了，笑盈盈地。</p>
<p>因為今年馬路上汽車的减少，於是一般人對於納凉的地位也就向外發展；人行道上坐滿了，就實行侵仿馬路，坐到馬路上，——甚至躺到馬路上，反正今年是不會有什麼公館裏太太小姐的兜風汽車撞到你的身上來的。</p>
<p>大華路和麥邊路在日裏是最冷淸淸地，但在晚上却有不少人看中那兒作為「納凉佳地」的，因為在那兒不但可以受到幾陣濟凉的晚風，而且還可以免費的享受一些美妙的音樂，——那新仙林和大都會的音樂會依風的傳送而帶到你的耳邊。然情的Hawaii　music以及中國小姐的歌唱，會使你聽得很過。</p>
<p>在報上的廣告中，常可見到有「納凉勝地」的地方。但那地方並不是隨使什麼人都可以進去，享受那似乎只有這「納凉勝地」所特有的那種凉一的。至少，到那地方去，除了「納凉」之外，還得耗費些CRB。那些地方，不外乎是咖啡館，花園舞廳之類，紳士型的老爺，摩登少爺小姐，就是常到那些地方去「納凉」的。陪了愛人上G．G．咖啡館的屋頂夜花園，或是到依文泰，新仙林，麗都的花園舞廳。比較凉爽些的似乎是靜安寺路畔的「仙樂司」夜花園，雖然它純是個「花園」而沒有Band，但靠着「麥格風」的傳播，坐在外面，一樣地可以聽釗從裏邊舞廳裏發出來的Jazz音樂。要是你坐在那些「納凉」的「勝地」中置是覺得「太凉」了的話，那你可招一位伴女來侍坐，或許她的一副「熱情」會使你不致「因太凉」而傷風。</p>
<p>雖是同是「納凉」，但闊人和古民幾方享受方面的相差，却亦是不可以道里計。</p>
<p>時常透露出水生渴望的苦痛，生活的重壓，使他們整天的讓自己浸沉在汗液和疲乏裏，掙扎着無力的身軀，抬起軟弱的手，跟着生活搏國，他們的汗，血，淚，的混溶液，來構成一寸布的結晶。</p>
<p>夏，在工傷裏，是不會永久停留的，去了又會回來，回來了又會去的，但是人的靑春呢？這一羣求生的掙札者，他們為了生活，就讓它、永久的埋葬在狹隘裏，是再不會湧現起浩大人生的意織來。</p>

<p>— 羅沉</p>
<p>為助學金診別試卷而作</p>
<p>因為朋友的關係，我得以見到申請助事金的同學的甄別試卷。從這裏面，引起我對現今一般回學讀書方法的意見。</p>
<p>題目出得很切實，它測騐了同學平時讀書用功的程度，同時，更要緊的，它也測騐了同學對書本消化」的程度，和對日常生活的注意與否。</p>
<p>前者（讀者用功）多數同學都做到了；而後者，它是比前者容易被忽視的。</p>
<p>那些試卷正說明這點。許多同學還是以舊的方法在讀書，他們沒有消化，誠然他們化了很多的功夫在書本上，但他們是錯了——他們竟一點也不注意到生活！</p>
<p>舉例說吧，凡是要死記的東西，大半的同學都回答得出。初中組裹有一題英文，是要寫出動詞的過去式及過去分式的，試卷中錯誤的僅佔到一成左右，但是很明顯的，這是他們平時死記的結果，有些人把音記得很準確，而字母却拼錯了。</p>
<p>反過來說，對於常識題目，却錯誤百出，有一位同學寫：發明進化論的是徐光啟。還有一位說進化論的發明者是孫中山，而相對論是羅斯福發明的。還有一位，地寫第三期的戶口米是大米一升，碎米半升，麵粉四十斤，——好豐富的食糧啊！</p>
<p>諸如此類，一般的學校敎師應該負一大部份的責任。因為敎帥們只要測騐學生是否讀了書，常常拿一些所謂冷門」的題目來難學生，以致同學們都鑽到牛角尖裏去了，反而把有用的，與日常牛活有關的常識，忽略過去。像許多同學對寒暑表的冰點和沸點也弄不淸楚（其實這是初中物理，甚至小學的自然上就有了的）。我相信如果你說在去問一般的同學說：前兩天最熱是一〇二度，為什麼水不會沸呢？水的沸點不是一百度嗎？——一定有許多人回答不出。</p>
<p>許多人一通家長和同學自己都在內）都有一種錯誤的觀念卹就是只顧到每學期升級，至於是否消化或已「吸受」就不管了。這樣的看法，結果是單注意考試和分數，考試的時候都是史加緊地用功，開夜車，强記，而平時對實生活都不注意。</p>
<p>有一位敎連育家曾干張：生活就是敎育，社會就是大學。道實在是一句至理名言。我們活在二十世紀的今天，我們不再是科舉時代了。我們得從書本來了解生活，認識世界這才是正當的讀書方法。</p>
<p>注意生活書狀子在現在是不台適的！</p>

<p>Bombay, 15th (Havas News Agency) – Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, leader of the Indian Liberal Party, issued a statement today calling on the British government to immediately send a delegation to India to reopen negotiations and resolve the Indian question. The statement said, "In recent days, various incidents have occurred throughout India, drastically changing the situation. After careful consideration, I believe the only feasible way to resolve the issue is for the British government to quickly send a plenipotentiary representative to consult with Indian leaders on all matters. This constructive negotiation should be conducted with courage and vision."</p>
<p>Saigon, 17th (Haitong News Agency) – According to news from New Delhi, Sapru, President of the Indian Liberal League, suggested mediating the conflict between the British government and the Congress Party. Sapru stated that he requested the British government to send a new delegation to India to reopen negotiations with Indian leaders. The Indian question should be resolved through political means.</p>
<p>London, 16th (Havas News Agency) – According to Reuters news today, several members of Parliament, especially Labour MPs, are now requesting that both Houses convene immediately to allow the government authorities to report on the Indian situation and discuss this issue as soon as possible. Parliament is currently in summer recess, which normally lasts ten weeks. Although it has been shortened, the general public is expressing dissatisfaction that cabinet members and members of Parliament still need to take vacations during wartime, while the holidays for workers in military factories have been reduced to two weeks a year.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Domei News Agency) – According to news obtained from Rome by the Nichi-Nichi Shimbun today, the Indian Chambers of Commerce in Bombay and New Delhi resolved yesterday to support the Indian independence movement and refuse to cooperate with British wartime industrial expansion in India.

<p>Advocating the Formation of a Provisional Government</p>
<p>Bombay, 16th (Havas News Agency) – The Executive Committee of the Indian Muslim League met here today, chaired by Jinnah, for two and a half hours, before deciding to continue the meeting tomorrow. Before the Executive Committee meeting, Jinnah received a telegram from Rajagopalachari, a key figure in the Indian Congress Party and the former Chief Minister of Madras Province, urging the Muslim League to cooperate with the Congress Party to break the current deadlock. The telegram stated, "At this moment, an urgent demand has arisen even among Muslims, believing that the only way to achieve a quick and decisive resolution is to form a provisional government that can speak for the country and demand that Britain relinquish all sovereignty in India. This move can shatter the imperialistic attempts of the British Empire to indefinitely remain in India. We assure the Muslim League that the right to self-determination of all political or religious entities within India will be respected by the Congress Party. The land belonging to each of these entities can, if possible, be designated as autonomous regions. In the future, the only connection between these regions and other parts of India will be the common mission arising from resisting aggression and defending the country. There should be no problem for the Muslim League to cooperate with the Congress Party on the above basis. In this way, a provisional government bearing full responsibility for national defense and administration can be established. We must act decisively at this critical moment to prevent disputes. The Muslim League should nominate representatives to participate in the future provisional government and notify the Congress Party of the number of participants. The Muslim League should also demand that the British government accept its proposed 'Muslim and Congress Party Joint Program.' If Britain or the Congress Party refuses, they will be responsible for the failure of this plan and all its consequences."</p>
<p>Bangkok, 17th (Haitong News Agency) – Madras dispatch: Rajagopalachari, former leader of the Madras government, wrote to Jinnah, Chairman of the Muslim Association, the night before the Executive Committee meeting, urging Muslims to negotiate with the British government and the Congress Party, advocating the formation of an Indian government representing all the people of India, and urging the British to hand over power to that government. The Muslim Association will cooperate with the Congress Party based on the "Partition Plan" to jointly resist foreign enemies.</p>
<p>Calcutta Post Office Burned Down</p>
<p>Bombay, 16th (Havas News Agency) – Unrest continues in major Indian cities. The Calcutta Post Office has been burned down. Several bus lines have resumed operations, but trams are still suspended. New Delhi is relatively calm, and trains have resumed operation. An explosive incident occurred in the Aminabad district of Lucknow, seriously injuring one police officer and slightly injuring several policemen. Afterwards, the authorities conducted a thorough search in the area near the explosion.</p>
<p>Gothenburg, 15th (Domei News Agency) – A week has passed since the Indian government arrested National Congress leaders Gandhi, Nehru, and Acharya on the morning of the 19th and began suppression. By the 10th, the Indian government had arrested approximately 200 key figures of the National Congress and their affiliates. The anti-British struggle of the Indian people, angered by the measures taken by the British authorities, is intensifying daily. According to a New Delhi dispatch on the 15th, the masses set fire to four railway stations between Madras and Calcutta. The railway line is now guarded by the military. Clashes between the masses and the police have occurred repeatedly, resulting in approximately 5,000 deaths and injuries. Most factories have been shut down due to worker strikes. Indian cabinet members of the Governor-General's Executive Council are urging the British authorities to allow more Indians to participate in the council and grant them positions such as Finance Minister in order to stop the anti-British demonstrations and restore the Indian Congress to normal. There are also rumors of a British monarch guaranteeing unconditional and complete independence after the war. However, in the current situation, it is impossible to win over the hearts of the Indian people with empty promises.</p>

<p>Buenos Aires, 16th (Havas News Agency) – Regarding the trade agreement negotiations between Spain and Argentina, the agreement can be signed once the governments of both parties approve the draft prepared by the experts. One of the clauses proposes the establishment of several free ports in Spain, allowing Argentine products to be transported to other countries through these ports. The trade agreement will be signed by Spanish representative Konos and Argentine Foreign Minister Ginasso, who are expected to make important statements reiterating the close ties between the two countries.</p>
<p>Argentina's Economic Relations with Europe</p>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Haitong News Agency) – The economic negotiations currently underway between Argentina and Spain in Buenos Aires are about to conclude with an agreement. The significance of this event is profound and incomparable, especially during this wartime period. It further demonstrates that South American countries are economically dependent on Europe, a fact that cannot be concealed by the rhetoric of the White House and Wall Street. It is important to understand that the natural phenomenon of economic mutual assistance does not exist between the United States and South America, but between Europe and South America. For example, in the years before the war, three-quarters of Argentina's export trade was to Europe, with half of it going to continental countries. The arguments and figures in the speech delivered by the Argentine Minister of Agriculture at the end of 1940 all demonstrate that Europe has always been the economic lifeline of Argentina. Trade between Argentina and Germany was extremely prosperous in the years before the war, which was greatly related to the economic recovery of Germany after the National Socialist Party came to power. As was the case after the last World War, Argentine President Irygoyen strongly resisted public opinion and maintained national neutrality, avoiding being drawn into the war. The benefits gained by the Argentine people are self-evident. The policies currently pursued by Argentina are also very wise, consistently adopting a realistic attitude towards the signatories of the Tripartite Pact.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 17th (Havas News Agency) – The focus of the Eastern Front has now shifted to the Stalingrad area and the upper reaches of the Komponga River. The fighting around Meiguupu has become secondary. The German side claims to control the entire Don River, which the Soviet Union denies. Moscow authorities expressed optimism yesterday about the battle for Stalingrad, and said that the German offensive from the southwest had failed. However, neutral observers said that the German army could attack Stalingrad from both the north and south at any time.</p>
<p>Hitler's Headquarters, 17th (Haitong News Agency) – The German military report this afternoon stated: "Our army continues to advance in the south of the lower reaches of the Kupen River and in the northwestern region of the Caucasus Mountains. Three enemy ships were sunk by our aircraft near the Black Sea coast, and one large transport ship was heavily damaged. The enemy was defeated in the northeastern part of the Don River bend, and the remaining enemy in this area is still being cleared. The entire Don River basin is under the control of the German and allied forces. Our fighter-bombers and dive-bombers also attacked enemy railway facilities. The enemy launched multiple attacks on Vyazma east and Rzhev yesterday, all of which were repelled. Several enemy troops were counterattacked by our army, suffering heavy losses. Several locations in the north were attacked by the enemy, but were repelled by intense artillery fire."</p>
<p>Istanbul, 17th (Haitong News Agency) – According to Soviet war reports, the Soviet army has withdrawn from Meiguupu, but destroyed the oil wells before retreating.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Domei News Agency) – According to observers, after the fall of Meiguupu Krasnodar, the oil fields in that area will be completely occupied by the German army. Part of the German army is pursuing the Red Army, while the other part is engaged in controlling the oil pipeline from Meiguupu to Duupus. The Meiguupu oil field is the most recently developed. In 1913, its output did not exceed 88,000 tons, but it gradually increased to 1,500,000 tons in 1937 and 2,200,000 tons in the following year.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 16th (Havas News Agency) – According to a TASS report, the German army on all fronts is currently fighting hard to advance, and the German General Staff has issued an order to transfer reserve units to reinforce the front lines. As of yesterday, the battle situation on each front was as follows:</p>
<p>- In the Kraskaya area, the German army repeatedly attempted to break into the Red Army's line of defense, but was repelled.</p>
<p>- The German army's attack on Stalingrad and the Volga River was unsuccessful and suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>- The German army's attack northeast of Kotelnikovo was defeated after fierce resistance from the Red Army. However, after obtaining reinforcements, the German army launched another attack towards the railway line from Kotelnikovo to Stalingrad.

<p>Stockholm, 17th (Domei News Agency) – According to a Berlin report, the first phase of the German summer offensive on the Eastern Front, which began after breaking through the Soviet defense line between Kursk and Kharkov and penetrating deep into central Caucasus, has come to an end. The second phase is underway, with the objectives being Stalingrad, the Caspian Sea port of Astrakhan, and the Black Sea ports.</p>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Haitong News Agency) – The German summer offensive is still underway. The German army, launched an offensive from Kursk, has now advanced to the northern Caucasus, penetrating 1,000 kilometers into the Soviet Union. The battlefield from Kharkov to the Don River bend has shifted eastward by more than 500 kilometers. The German army in the lower reaches of the Kupen River continues to clear the remaining Soviet troops. The German, Romanian, and Slovak armies are pursuing the retreating Soviet troops and advancing towards the Black Sea ports of Novorossiysk, Anapa, and Tuapse. German aircraft are bombing the ports to prevent Soviet troops from evacuating by sea, sinking three troop transport ships. The German armored and motorized units in the southeastern Caucasus are continuing to advance towards the Grozny oil fields and the Caspian Sea. The Soviet army between the Volga River and the Don River is about to collapse. The Soviet rear railway lines have also been bombed by German aircraft. The remaining Soviet troops in the northern part of the Don River bend are being successively defeated by the German army. The German army has established bridgeheads near the Volga River bend and on the east bank of the Don River. Yesterday was the 50th day of the German summer offensive. It seems appropriate to review the achievements of the German army and its allied forces. Chida Tsusai admitted in a secret order issued on July 28 that the Soviet Union had lost 70,000,000 civilians, and the German-occupied area south of the Don River still had a population of approximately 6,000,000. The number of Soviet soldiers killed and wounded and Soviet civilians who died of starvation is between 12,000,000 and 15,000,000. The total population of the Soviet Union in 1939 was 191,700,000, but it has now lost half of its population. The Soviet Union has also lost approximately 60% of its coal production, approximately 60% of its iron production, and approximately two-thirds of its manganese production. Approximately two-thirds of grains and livestock have also been lost.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 17th (Haitong News Agency) – A British broadcaster stated that the British government believes that the next sixty days are the most crucial for the success or failure of this war. Regarding the battles in the Caucasus and Volga regions, we will not be able to breathe a sigh of relief until two months later.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Allied Conference Moves to Near East; Moscow Talks Conclude, New Plan for Military Aid to Soviet Union to be Formulated <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, 17th (Domei News Agency) – According to a London report, the Allied conference in Moscow was originally shrouded in mystery. It is now rumored that the venue has been moved to somewhere in the Near East. According to reliable sources in London, there will be no official announcement regarding this conference this week. However, it is believed that the situation of the meeting in Moscow has come to an end.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 17th (Haitong News Agency) – "The Evening News" London dispatch states that the Allied conference previously held in Moscow has now been moved elsewhere. Only a few well-informed sources in London know the location of the Allied representatives. The location must be somewhere between Moscow and Cairo, and the representatives participating are probably on an inspection tour. According to recent news, officials are still keeping the details of the conference secret, and it is expected that nothing will be revealed before the weekend. Because a certain important person has postponed his return to London, there are rumors that the Allied representatives will travel to India or Chongqing. Another rumor claims that the delegation has already set off for the United States via Vladivostok. A Stockholm dispatch points out that these speculations are not very accurate. However, it is more likely that the conference has been moved to the Near East.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 17th (Haitong News Agency) – The British press unanimously believes that the issue of Allied aid to the Soviet Union is the main issue to be discussed at the Moscow conference. Several newspapers also stated that the Allies have drafted a new plan to supply the Soviet Union with military supplies. London's "Sunday Times" stated that the Soviet Union urged close cooperation between the British, American, and Soviet general staffs, and it is heard that the Allied plans to launch offensives in the Mediterranean, Pacific, and Soviet front lines were also discussed at the meeting.</p>
<p>Churchill's Purpose in Visiting the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th (German News Agency) – According to news obtained tonight, Churchill has been in Moscow since August 13th, accompanied by several senior British military officers and Roosevelt's special envoy Harriman. U.S. Ambassador to Turkey Steinhardt has also arrived in Moscow. Churchill traveled by plane via Cairo and Tehran to Moscow, and his trip was very secret. The fact that Churchill made the long journey to visit Moscow in person shows that he has great anxiety about the future development of the war.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Domei News Agency) – According to news from London, Churchill and Stalin met for a total of three days from Wednesday to Saturday of last week. Attendees included Harriman, Brooke, Wavell, Molotov, and Voroshilov.</p>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Haitong News Agency) – A Swedish report cites Swiss diplomatic sources as pointing out that Churchill's recent visit to Moscow had three purposes:</p>
<p>1. Churchill, in view of the critical situation in the Soviet Union, believes that it is necessary to take action to maintain the Soviet Union's continued resistance.</p>
<p>2. Churchill believes that it is necessary for him to personally investigate the current situation in the Soviet Union and explain the issue of the Second Front.</p>
<p>3. Churchill wants to study whether the Soviet system can last. It is heard that Roosevelt's representative Harriman and several British military experts accompanied Churchill.</p>

<h3 id="e20">From Lecturing to Imprisonment (I) <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— Tie Ming</p>
<p>I am least afraid of speaking. No matter what language—Mandarin, Cantonese, English—I use three parts for every one part I learn. People think I have a talent for learning languages; but in reality, it's just that I'm thick-skinned and bold. Learning a language only requires these two abilities.</p>
<p>Since arriving in Europe, I have felt strongly that English doesn't work on the Continent and that I must learn more French and German. I already understand some German, enough to get by; so whenever I have the opportunity, I try my best to improve my French.</p>
<p>My French is, of course, very basic. The verb conjugations make my head ache; the genders of nouns are completely illogical, and often the opposite of German. But I don't care about these things. Every time I go to France, I speak haphazardly, and when I can't make myself understood, I use the most common French gestures as much as possible. Fortunately, the French are generally more amiable than the British. When they see a foreigner speaking French poorly, they are not only not annoyed, but very sympathetic, and they understand even what is not clearly spoken.</p>
<p>In Paris, I met a member of the same family as an old colleague, Chief Technician Zhang. He was studying political science and was a long-time Parisian. After one meeting, then two, we quickly hit it off. He suggested that I give a few lectures at the "Chinese Academic Lecture Series" at the University of Paris. According to him, this kind of lecture is not easy to get. He said that, at least in recent years, he hadn't heard of any Chinese university professor being invited to give a lecture.</p>
<p>Okay! Lecturing isn't difficult. After being a professor for more than ten years, am I afraid of a few academic lectures? My French isn't good, but that doesn't matter either. The French are very understanding—and the most profound truths can only be understood intuitively, not verbally.</p>
<p>Lecturing in France is truly a very valuable thing: for China, it can be said to be a work of fostering friendly relations and cultural exchange. I planned to talk about some problems in theoretical chemistry, because agricultural chemistry, which I have researched more thoroughly, is too localized and not suitable as a topic for this kind of lecture. French theoretical chemists told me many unheard-of new discoveries. This is something I wouldn't get in Germany. The Germans are most diligent. They read all reports published in any language; and their publications are more than sufficient to include all their research. So, when you go to Germany to lecture, you can't tell them anything, and they have nothing new to tell you. In France, it's different. They are often very unfamiliar with research from other countries, and just when you think French science is backward and has no new progress, something unexpected often arises. An unknown Frenchman—sometimes even a French woman—has just discovered the newest and most earth-shattering theory. Radioactivity is an excellent example, as is wave mechanics. This newest theory not only made Professor Einstein's theory of relativity relatively simple and crude like child's play, but also unintentionally exiled Eugene Galois to Devil's Island, and me—I hope—sent me to the Ambert local prison.</p>
<p>I originally wanted to publish this memoir in the Chinese Chemical Journal, then this long "prelude" could be deleted. But the readers of this journal would definitely ask me what I was doing on Rue Cuyas at eleven o'clock on the night of June 28th? How did that toothless person recognize me? And how did I understand something about the relationship of wave mechanics to chemistry? There were many announcements hanging near the Sorbonne for my lectures at the University of Paris. The latest issue of the Illustrated Weekly (Llllusrtation) also published a photo of me, with a pseudo-biographical note below. That day was my last lecture. After finishing, I sat at the Cafes Soufflet on the corner of Bonlevard St. Miehel and Rue des Ecoles, drinking many beers with French colleagues, including the famous chemists Henriot and his wife. At the table behind us, one of their students and a young woman were playing cards. This situation, not to mention that you couldn't find it in the snack shops of Zhenru Jiangwan University, and when I was in America, it was during Prohibition, so of course it couldn't be compared, and I hadn't even seen it in Oxford or Cambridge, where drinking is common.</p>
<p>The toothless man was dressed exceptionally raggedly, with a hungry look on his face. Most people in Paris have work to do, so it's rare to see someone so destitute. He approached me step by step and said, "Please look at this. If you want to know more, please come with me." After he finished speaking, he retreated to a dark corner by the door. I was baffled, and looked at the piece of paper he had put in my hand. Huh! Isn't that part of the carbon wave equation? I remember that carbon seems to have forty-two simultaneous wave partial differential equations. If someone can solve these equations, it won't be difficult to thoroughly understand all the hidden properties of this element. A beggar might have copied some strange things to use as a guise for deception, but this person didn't seem like it, because not only was the handwriting clear and the symbols correct, but I believed that those completely new arrangements had not yet been published.</p>
<p>I don't have any special hobbies in my life, just curiosity. I hope to know a little about everything new, and my ability to understand theoretical chemistry relatively well has also been rewarded by this curiosity. At that time, my curiosity couldn't help but erupt, and I stood up and walked to the man's side. He waited for me to approach, and said in a very low voice: "Midnight, come to the Bar du Progres at Portedela Villette." Lin's voice trembled, indicating that he was feeling great fear, and at the same time he made a gesture, telling me to leave quickly.</p>
<p>It was an hour before midnight. Looking at the situation, I expected something strange to happen. I wasn't timid, after all, I was a poor man, but I also had to make some necessary preparations, especially being in a foreign country. So I said goodbye to Henriot and the others, and carefully made sure that no one was watching me, and quickly walked into the Cafed Earcourt, and while drinking coffee, wrote a postcard to my friend Mr. Zhang—most of the cafes in Paris sell postcards, and there are mailboxes at the door, which is very convenient for me—briefly explaining the situation that night, and asking him to call me the next day at noon; if I hadn't returned, please report it to the police immediately. This postcard was written in Chinese, so it could avoid being read by others.</p>
<p>I went into the subway to take the underground train. Villette Gate is in the northeast corner of Paris, and I had visited a slaughterhouse there. On the train, I tried my best to calm myself, but I think a very observant person could still see the look of panic on my face.</p>
<p>The Bar du Progres is a very small and dark bar, the interior is exactly the same as thousands of other small bars in Paris, with that long counter, a fat old woman behind the counter, and all kinds of wine bottles behind the old woman. In the corner there was a small table with only two seats, facing the door, where you could see all the movements at the door. I went to occupy this table and ordered a glass of Canet wine. If it were in the Montmartre area, it would be the time for singing and drinking, but in this deserted small bar, besides me, there was only a truck driver gesticulating to the landlady about how his truck had been hit by someone else. Cars in Paris, as usual, are reckless and impolite, making passengers who come to Paris for the first time unable to stop their hair from standing on end. There are not too many accidents, but once there is a collision, whether there is a right side is very problematic! The driver was also putting all the blame and guilt completely on the other party, and grumbling that he had been delayed a lot in his sleeping time because of this.</p>
<p>The clock struck twelve, and that friend from Rue Cuyas came and sat opposite me without a word. I ordered a glass of Canet wine for him too, and added several more glasses in a row. His missing teeth were just a part of his great wounds. At this time, I saw clearly that the scar on his face was an old scar, perhaps a memento of the last European war. He spoke very quickly and softly for about an hour, mostly in not very standard rural French with a heavy accent. Although he tried his best to use ordinary words and simple syntax, I still had a hard time listening, so in important places he also added a few English words, and even mixed in many German scientific terms.</p>
<p>His expression was very unnatural, obviously harboring great terror, but it seemed that his terror had become natural, a phenomenon caused by long-term danger.</p>
<p>The gist of our conversation was like this—I believe that what I remember will not have major errors:</p>
<p>"Do you know about Eugene Galois?"</p>
<p>"I heard that he committed murder and was exiled to Devil's Island. But I don't believe that a great mathematician would be so blinded by greed that he would murder a friend for money. Haven't some people wanted to file an appeal? If there is anything I can do to help, I am happy to comply."</p>
<p>"Very good, but too late! He died last month. Several prisoners there kept parrots as pets, and a plague broke out, and the terrible parrot disease was transmitted to him. Because he died, I am telling you this. Since Watt invented the steam engine, there has been no greater invention than his, and his being harmed is because he knew too much. After you listen to me, you may become the richest person in the world, but you will also be qualified to be assassinated. As long as someone sees you with me, there may be immediate danger. If you are afraid, we had better leave."</p>

<h3 id="e21">British Officials and Citizens, Etc. Yesterday Withdrew and Returned Home. The Kamakura Maru Weighed Anchor at About 5 PM. More Than 3,000 Foreign Nationals Have Been Evacuated. <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Mail Steamer Company's large 14,000-ton transport ship, Kamakura Maru, weighed anchor at about 5 PM yesterday from the Wa Wharf in Pudong, carrying 907 British and other Allied officials and citizens, evacuating to Portuguese East Africa's Magus. The entire journey from Shanghai to the Philippines takes six weeks. After the evacuated personnel arrive on the other side and exchange for Japanese nationals, they will transfer and return to England, and are expected to reach London in late October. Yesterday's evacuated personnel included 459 officials, including 369 British, 31 Polish, 28 Belgian, 23 Dutch, 6 Norwegian, and 2 Greek; 448 ordinary expatriates, including 167 British expatriates in Shanghai, 163 British expatriates in other ports, 10 Belgian, 14 Norwegian, 3 Dutch, 7 Greek, 47 Polish, 11 Allied expatriates in other ports, and 25 others.</p>
<p>Officials and Expatriates Boarded Separately</p>
<p>The Allied personnel who withdrew yesterday were one of the largest groups since the evacuation work began. To avoid crowding, the evacuees were divided into two groups to board the ship. The first group was ordinary expatriates, who departed in four groups at 6:00 AM, 6:20 AM, 6:30 AM, and 7:45 AM yesterday morning from the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Route Tenant de la Tour, the Columbia Country Club, Hua Mao Apartments, and the Racecourse, in 15 specially prepared buses, and drove to the New Customs Wharf to assemble, and were transferred by several ferry ships such as the Jinling Maru to the Kamakura Maru. The officials then boarded in 14 buses from various assembly points to the New Customs Wharf between 12:00 PM and 1:00 PM. Yesterday's scene at the New Customs Wharf was very lively, but the military and police security was even more stringent than during the evacuation of American officials and expatriates and the last British expatriates. The number of people seeing them off was shoulder-to-shoulder, about a thousand people, because there were many celebrities on the sea among the evacuees.</p>
<p>Gentry, Merchants, and Celebrities Were Allowed to Withdraw First</p>
<p>The ranks of those who withdrew yesterday included the British Consul General in Shanghai, George; British Embassy Chinese Affairs Counselor Backhouse; Polish Ambassador to Japan, Roman Knoll; Belgian Minister to Beijing, Kim; Dutch Chargé d'Affaires to Beijing, Flash; former Inspector General of the Maritime Customs, Mr. and Mrs. Merger; Customs Commissioner, Mr. and Mrs. Rouffaud; HSBC Shanghai General Manager, Mr. Hawes; Moutrie &amp; Co. General Manager, Marten; former Chairman of the Municipal Council, Phillipe; Acting Chief Inspector of the Police Department, Smith; Political Director, Robertson; Director of the Industrial and Social Affairs Department, Ms. Hsing Te; Far East Editor of the English Evening Post &amp; Mercury and Editor of the Far East Magazine, Woodhead; Reuters Far East Manager, Blom; and London Daily Mail special correspondent to Shanghai, Feng Jiu, etc. Generally speaking, the British Consulate General in Shanghai and the British Embassy offices were all evacuated. As for the expatriates, according to the opinions of the London government, famous people were allowed to be evacuated first, so many celebrities from the British banking and business circles in this city were evacuated. In addition, 12 people from the Axis countries also attached to the transport to return to Europe.</p>
<p>The Total Number of Evacuees Has Exceeded 3,000</p>
<p>It is understood that the consultation between Japan and the Allied countries on the exchange of officials and citizens was first announced by the Swiss Consul General in Shanghai, Fontanier, in March of this year. Subsequently, the registration of diplomatic and consular officials and ordinary expatriates from Britain, the United States, and other countries in this city began, and after several months of preparation, the first evacuation began at the end of June. The Conte Verde and Asama Maru each carried 1,500 evacuees from Shanghai and Yokohama to East Africa. Earlier this month, the Tatsuta Maru carried 900 Japanese and Chinese evacuees to the Philippines. Including yesterday's departing Kamakura Maru, the Allied officials and citizens evacuated from various parts of the Far East have reached 3,300. As for whether the evacuation will continue in the future, it is said that it has not yet entered the negotiation stage, and all progress must be judged based on past achievements. It is rumored that after the Conte Verde and Asama Maru return to Japan, they will continue to be dispatched to deal with the evacuation. The official has not given a definite statement.</p>

<p>The Municipal Council's Information Office announced that the Bureau has received reports that some people have been soliciting subleases from sub-landlords to measure the area of the subleased portion of the house and charge fees, etc. It has been found that calculating the area of the sublease is a simple procedure in accordance with the regulations of the Sublease Housing License Office. It only needs to be handled by the sub-landlord and the sub-tenant through consultation, without the need for outside help. If you encounter someone who claims to be measuring and charging fees in the future, you should immediately report to the above-mentioned office in Room 374, Municipal Council Building, 180 Fuzhou Road, for verification.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Collection of Sublease Licenses Yesterday Started with Fines <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The collection of sublease housing licenses for the next quarter of this year has been issued by the Municipal Council Building on Hankou Road and various district offices since July 1. So far, it has been a month and a half. A certain staff member of the Sublease Housing License Management Office told reporters that there were more than 35,000 sub-landlords in the Public Concession who went to collect them during this period. However, this is still less than the previous quarter of this year, so the results are not satisfactory. It is now known that from yesterday (17th), the deadline has passed, and a fine of 10 yuan must be paid separately. If you reapply for the license after September 1, you must pay an additional 5 yuan fine. After September 15, the authorities will send personnel to investigate. If the sub-landlord refuses to obtain the license, the authorities will file a complaint with the court in accordance with the law and handle it strictly without pardon.</p>

<p>Sun Shengchang, a Ningbo native residing at No. 18 Anshun Lane, Kangti Road, is 53 years old and works as a wool merchant. Previously, he had bad feelings with the sub-landlord Qiu Zhang due to arrears in rent. He filed a complaint with the French patrol, accusing Qiu Zhang's daughter Qiu Lizhu of hiring people to commit assault and steal his 10,000 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates. The captain rejected the case because the accusation was false. Sun was still unwilling and filed a complaint with the patrol last month, accusing the head of the Lianbao and Baojia of colluding to steal two pieces of white broadcloth worth 20,000 yuan. Captain Geng sent detectives to investigate and found that Sun's accusations were completely false and intended to frame others, which was very abhorrent. Sun was detained, investigated, and sent to court for public prosecution on charges of false accusation. After interrogation and final hearing, Sun Shengchang was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment yesterday.</p>

<p>Xu Alin, a native of Jiangbei, is 43 years old this year. He is currently a firefighter at the French Concession Fire Brigade No. 33 on Rue Lestock. He is acquainted with Sun Fengying (30 years old this year), a woman from Yangzhou who lives at No. 19 Rue Sainte-Marie, and rented No. 21 Rixin Lane, Jin Shenfu Road, Dapuqiao, as a place for secret rendezvous. Recently, he learned that Sun had made a new love and held a grudge. At 12:00 noon on the 16th, Xu met Sun at the home of Sun's younger sister at No. 256 Rue Gascoyne. Xu immediately reprimanded Sun. The two disagreed and started arguing. First, they argued verbally, then Xu wielded a knife and slashed violently at Sun Fengying, who suffered head injuries and bled profusely. Sun was injured and escaped through the back door, shouting for help. Xu chased after her. When Sun saw the patrol approaching upon hearing the sound, she turned back to the front door of No. 256 Rue Gascoyne and hid inside. Xu also chased in, rushed upstairs, entered the front room, saw sharp scissors on the table, and immediately used the scissors to stab his abdomen. After going downstairs, he went up to the third floor and climbed onto the roof from the skylight. Seeing the patrol shouting below, Xu, in a panic, conceived the idea of ending his life and climbed to the overstreet building and jumped off to commit suicide. He fell, injuring his head and feet internally, and could not get up. He was sent to Guangci Hospital by the patrol, but died due to his serious injuries. The body was sent to the coroner's office by the patrol. Yesterday, his father Xu Xuegao claimed the body for burial. As for Sun Fengying, she suffered severe head injuries and is still being treated in the hospital.</p>

<h3 id="e30">The Once-a-Year Heavenly River Meeting <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>In the human world, there are many happy couples; how could there not be lovers in the heavens? This is the origin of the Qixi (Double Seventh) myth of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl meeting on the Milky Way.</p>
<p>According to ancient legends, the Cowherd and Weaver Girl live on opposite sides of the Milky Way (called the Silver River because its starlight and color resemble silver), visible but unattainable. Magpies use their wings to form a bridge on the evening of the seventh day of the seventh month for their once-a-year meeting. The Jingchu Chronicle of Seasonal Customs also states, "On the seventh day of the seventh month, the Cowherd and Weaver Girl meet on the Milky Way." Note that the Jingchu Chronicle of Seasonal Customs was selected by Zong Lin of the Liang Dynasty, who was a native of Chu, so what he recorded was about matters in the Jingchu region. Before the Liang Dynasty, there was also the "Autumn Wind Swallow Song" by Emperor Wen of Wei, which also sang of this matter.</p>
<p>"The autumn wind is bleak, the weather is cold, the grass and trees wither, and the dew turns to frost. The flocks of swallows bid farewell and return, the magpies fly south. Thinking of my lord traveling far away, my intestines are filled with longing. I earnestly desire to return to my homeland, why does my lord linger and entrust himself to another place? Your humble concubine toils alone, guarding the empty chamber. Worry comes, thinking of my lord, I dare not forget, tears fall and soak my clothes. I pick up the zither and play, uttering a clear melody. The short song and soft sigh cannot last long, the bright moon shines on my bed. The Milky Way flows westward, the night is not yet over, the Cowherd and Weaver Girl gaze at each other from afar, what crime have you committed to be separated by the River Bridge?" This depicts a young woman in an empty boudoir moved by autumn thoughts, also feeling the "Cowherd and Weaver Girl gazing at each other from afar." Thus, it is known that the Qixi meeting aims to make up for the deficiencies of the celestial lovers, already from the Han and Wei Dynasties.</p>
<p>Brief Talk on the Cowherd and Weaver Girl Stars</p>
<p>Why must the Cowherd and Weaver Girl meet only on the Qixi Festival? This is due to the relationship of stellar movements. It is precisely the beginning of autumn, the heat has not yet dissipated, looking up at the sky, the Milky Way is vast, winding like a river, the two stars face each other from afar, sparkling and dazzling, how could it not move people's distant thoughts, arouse people's attention, and create myths? Using the human world to represent the heavens is also a common thought of mankind.</p>
<p>The names of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl stars have been around since ancient times. The "Da Dong" chapter of the Book of Songs, Minor Odes of the Kingdom says: "In the sky is the Milky Way, shining brightly; Look at that Weaver Girl, all day seven times she weaves; Although she weaves seven times, she does not produce a pattern; Look at that Cowherd, he does not use it to carry goods."</p>
<p>The Records of the Grand Historian and the Book of Han both have accounts. The Book of Han says: "The Southern Dipper is the temple, north of it is the Jian star, the Jian star is the flag. The Cowherd is the sacrificial ox. North of it is the He Drum; the big star is the supreme general; left is the left general; right is the right general. North of it is the Weaver Girl, the Weaver Girl is the granddaughter of the Heavenly Emperor."</p>
<p>The Book of Jin speaks in more detail, here is the summary: "The Weaver Girl has three stars, at the end of the Heavenly Discipline, she is the heavenly woman: in charge of fruits, melons, silks, fabrics, treasures, and jewels." "The He Drum has three stars, north of the Cowherd, it is the heavenly drum, in charge of military affairs, in the middle is the axe. One day there are three martial arts, in charge of the emperor's three generals." "The Cowherd has six stars, the bridge of the sky, in charge of sacrificial affairs." "The Weaver Girl star is today's main star of the Lyra constellation. It must wait until the handle of the Big Dipper points south (this refers to the Big Dipper), and it is seen as if it is on top of the head, this is the scene in the sixth and seventh months of summer and autumn. There are two theories about the Cowherd star, one is that the Ox asterism in the twenty-eight mansions is regarded as it, the so-called six Cowherd stars. The other is that the He Drum is regarded as it, belonging to the Aquila constellation, separated from the Weaver Girl star by the river, almost in a straight line. The He Drum is commonly called the Carrying Pole Star, with two stars on the left and right, and a star in the middle, resembling a carrying pole carrying objects. The Cowherd belongs to the Capricorn constellation, and the Southern Dipper belongs to the Sagittarius constellation, both of which are one of the twelve zodiac signs.</p>
<p>The ancients called the Ox and Dipper referring to this. For example, Su Dongpo's "Ode to the Red Cliff" says: "Soon the moon rose above the eastern mountain, wandering between the Ox and Dipper," which is the scene on the night of the sixteenth of the seventh month. Also, the "Preface to the Pavilion of Prince Teng": "The essence of things and heavenly treasures, the dragon light shoots at the ruins of the Ox and Dipper." Considering that the Ox and Dipper are all stars in the south, the ancients used them to refer to the area of today's Jiangxi province, that is, the ancient areas of Yuzhang and Fengcheng, which are the ruins of the Ox and Dipper.</p>
<p>The Origin of Begging for Skills Emphasizes Needlework</p>
<p>When did the practice of begging for skills on the Qixi Festival begin? I have read few books and do not know the details. However, since the Jingchu Chronicle of Seasonal Customs has this saying, it is known that it was prevalent in the Liang Dynasty. The saying goes: "On the seventh day of the seventh month, the Cowherd and Weaver Girl meet on the Milky Way, women tie colored threads and thread seven-hole needles to beg for skills; if there are spiderwebs on melons, it is considered successful."</p>
<p>Since the Weaver Girl is a weaver, begging for skills is also a matter of women's needlework, which is done on the evening of the seventh day. The Qixi Festival is close to the waxing gibbous moon, and the moonlight is not yet bright, so being able to thread a seven-hole needle under the moonlight indicates superior eyesight. Needlework and weaving are fine and detailed, relying on eyesight, so they compete with each other in this aspect. This is why Cui Hao's poem says, "In the city of Chang'an, the moonlight is like silk, every family holds needles and threads tonight." In the past, there were two ways to test the quality of eyesight, one was to thread a needle under the moonlight, and the other was to see that the sixth star of the Big Dipper, Kaiyang, is a binary star, and there is a small star next to it, those who can see it must have strong eyesight.</p>
<p>"Xizi" refers to small spiders with long legs. It is said that seeing them descending with silk threads indicates good fortune, so they are named "happy spiders." On the Qixi Festival, fruits and melons are displayed in the courtyard to beg for skills, and those who encounter happy spiders weaving webs are considered to have obtained skills, which is very possible in the summer.</p>
<p>The "Record of Scenery and Objects of the Imperial Capital" says that needles are reflected in water during the day, and their shapes are used to determine whether one has obtained skills. The saying goes: "On the seventh day of the seventh month, women expose a basin of water to the sun at noon, after a while, a film forms on the water surface, and when a needle is thrown in, it floats, then the shadow of the needle at the bottom of the water is observed. If it forms clouds, flowers, birds, or animal shadows, or shoe, scissor, or eggplant shadows, it is said that skills have been obtained."</p>
<p>According to the principles of water surface tension, throwing a needle into water and reflecting light will result in various shapes. The film is not only produced after exposure to sunlight. Some people also fill a bowl with water and submerge leaves of balsam flowers in it, leaving it out in the dew overnight on Qixi. The next morning, a needle is thrown in. A thick needle shadow indicates clumsiness, while a weaving shadow indicates skill.</p>
<p>I have always suspected that since the legend of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl appeared in the Wei Dynasty, the practice of begging for skills is also thought to have begun around the same time, or it may be based on the Needle God. Xue Lingyun, the beautiful concubine of Emperor Wen of Wei, was skilled in embroidery. Even in the depths of the palace, without using candles, she could still make garments in a standing position. The palace called her the Needle God. Consequently, women followed suit, regarding it as a beautiful story. Who knows if the practice of threading needles under the moonlight on the Qixi Festival was not inspired by Lingyun?</p>
<p>The Palace of Eternal Life on the Seventh Day of the Seventh Month</p>
<p>Since Bai Juyi's "Song of Everlasting Regret" became a household name, "On the seventh day of the seventh month, in the Palace of Eternal Life, at midnight when no one is around, they whisper to each other. In heaven, may we be birds that fly wing to wing; on earth, may we be trees with intertwined branches. Heaven and earth may have an end, but this regret will last forever."</p>
<p>Is well-known. It seems that the Qixi Heavenly River meeting is not just something that happens in the heavens; in the human world too, feelings are deep and intentions are lingering, entangled endlessly. When it comes to love, many things go wrong, falsehoods become truths, the deepest love turns into a source of resentment, confusion and disorder reign, and foolish fantasies are beyond reason and language. Therefore, those who hate love are better off than the Cowherd and Weaver Girl, with endless longing in two places, easy to part but difficult to meet. If spirits can communicate, why would there be such tragedies of separation and reunion as the Palace of Eternal Life and Mawei Slope? That is why Du Fu has a poem praising the Cowherd and Weaver Girl: "The Cowherd comes out of the west of the river, the Weaver Girl comes out of the east, for ten thousand ages they look at each other, who sees them together on the Qixi Festival? Divine light is difficult to wait for, this matter is always hazy, suddenly their spirits merge, why must they meet in autumn?"</p>
<p>Heaven and Earth Are the Same</p>
<p>Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, who shook the remote regions and made the Han people famous, was born on the seventh day of the seventh month at dawn. Emperor Daowu of the Tuoba Wei, the first to declare himself emperor, Gui, was also born on the seventh day of the seventh month. Wei Chu's body was twice the size of an ordinary child, and the hidden umbilical cord of the Tibetan compatriots later became a forest. However, there were also emperors who died on the seventh day of the seventh month, such as the Latter Emperor of the Song Dynasty in the Six Dynasties, and Prince Baling, Xiu Ruo, but they were all killed and did not die a natural death. There were even those who were born on the seventh day of the seventh month and also died on the seventh day of the seventh month, such as Tang Dynasty Chancellor Qiao Lin. During the Zhu Ci Rebellion, Lin submitted to Bi. When the capital was recovered, Lin, as the former chancellor, lost his integrity and betrayed justice, and was not pardoned even in his old age. Lin sighed before his execution, "I was born on the seventh day of the seventh month, and I die on this day, is it not fate!"</p>
<p>In short, all myths are created from human emotions, entrusted to the gods, and entrusted to the spirits. With "the Southern Dipper as the temple," the "Cowherd is the sacrifice." With the Milky Way as the river, the nine stars of Tianjin are the bridge. Which human being does not wish "all lovers to become married couples"? Therefore, the eternally unchanging Cowherd and Weaver Girl stars are fabricated to meet once a year on the seventh day of the seventh month. In China, which has always embraced the agricultural ideal of men plowing and women weaving, it is said that the Weaver Girl and Cowherd in heaven are also engaged in plowing and weaving. The shape of the star is like a shuttle, so it is named the Weaver Girl; Westerners think it is like a violin, so it is named the Lyra. It can be seen that all realms are created by the mind, heaven and earth are the same, without humans, what is heaven, without heart, what are humans, all things past and present, should be viewed in this way. Therefore, my writing about the Qixi Festival and begging for skills today is also meddlesome! However, using it to pass the long day, to relieve the summer heat, and to find coolness in troubles is also a joy in itself.</p>
<p>Letter</p>
<p>To whom it may concern, according to the statement of the person concerned, Zhang Xintai, upon reading today's news section of Xin Shen and Liang newspapers concerning the rental dispute of currency values, much of what was stated does not conform to the facts. For example, it was said that there were as many as 124 tenants in the three houses, with 24 households, etc. In fact, many of the residents were employees and workers of Yongyu and Long tea firms, and the three tenants were a minority. Also, regarding the renewal of the new contract, at this time, the ratio of new currency to old currency is 77%, and the new contract clearly states that the rent does not distinguish between new and old legal tender, and is willing to pay the current legal tender in full without discount. Zhuo Huapu's apprentice, Zhang Xintai, suddenly regretted the agreement and hid the new contract, etc., which is not factual. Therefore, he specially commissioned your lawyer to send a letter to the two newspaper offices for correction. Based on this, we hereby send this letter, hoping that your newspaper office will make a correction. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai News Editorial Department of Shen Bao, Ganlin Lawyer, August 17th.</p>

<h3 id="e32">China Youth Corps Leader Broadcasts; Invited by Minister of Information Yokoyama <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Qian Dan, the head of the China Youth Corps, was invited by Minister of Information Yokoyama to broadcast at the Greater Shanghai Broadcasting Station at 10:25 last night. The text of the speech is recorded below:</p>
<p>It has been exactly five full years since the August 13th Incident. The suffering of the Shanghai people caused by the war is truly indescribable. The only way to relieve this suffering is peace.</p>
<p>Our ideal goal is, of course, comprehensive peace. However, comprehensive peace cannot be achieved overnight. Comprehensive peace must start from local peace, and local peace must start from stabilizing society and people's livelihood. How can we achieve local peace? I believe that only pure youth can take on the work of peace, so we must start with training youth. However, should we start with student youth or vocational youth? This is indeed a question worth considering. According to my observation, in the current environment in China, if we want to train youth, we should start with youth who have already entered society. We do not harbor the extravagant hope of achieving comprehensive peace immediately. We hope to have local peace first. Now our corps is starting to work for local peace, we are starting local peace in Shanghai. Then, how do we start this local peace work? I think there are four points: 1. Understanding Japan, 2. Social progress, 3. Training in normal thinking, 4. Promotion of production capacity.</p>
<p>Understanding Japan We cannot look at Japan superficially, we must thoroughly understand Japan. Now Japan, since the development of the government's central centralization movement, the strengthening of economic control by the people, and the actions of all political institutions, has gradually progressed, so that the country has a unified leadership and is on the right track. The government uses the power of national politics to solve social and livelihood problems, so that people can live a disciplined and peaceful life. I saw in Japan that the lives of the Japanese people, under iron-like discipline and a strong controlled economy, are more serious and difficult than the current situation in China by hundreds of times. However, the Japanese people can live in an extremely pleasant atmosphere. What is the reason for this? Because their love for the country is at the cost of any sacrifice, and their support for the country's policies is absolute. The only purpose is the strength of the country, and individual freedom is not considered. This is the spirit of public service and abiding by the law, and strict observance of discipline. We see that the Japanese youth, under the will of the country above all else, have the spirit of strict observance of discipline, and we should deeply feel the necessity of training our country's youth in the same way. Therefore, we must first have a thorough understanding of Japan and learn from it.</p>
<p>How to Stabilize Society and People's Livelihood How can we stabilize society and people's livelihood? We know that the current institutions for stabilizing society in China have been destroyed, and the elements of social production have been dispersed. Therefore, how to restore production institutions, how to concentrate production elements, and how to train production youth are indeed several important issues at present. The training of production youth who bear the mission of stabilizing society is the most urgent task. Because production youth, in the current environment, especially in China's national conditions, must first train and concentrate them. You think, can those parents who cannot produce still talk about educating their children who do not produce? So, I think the training of academic youth can be the second step of the work. Now Japan is helping us do this work of stabilizing society. Although they are helping us, we should show a great fearless spirit to strive for anything that does not meet our ideals, because Japan is not unwilling to accept our proposals. It is because we have always given up the national position and do not strive for them. I think since Japan loves China, they will definitely accept our righteous proposals. The most feared thing is that we have no proposals.</p>
<p>How to Promote Production Function How is the production function promoted? We see that after August 13th, Shanghai's production institutions have been almost completely destroyed. But conversely, the only point of existence of the Shanghai market is speculation, because the success of speculation is easy, creating two bad mentalities for the youth, that is, the mentality of luck and dependence. Therefore, under the joint construction and cultivation of many production youth, Shanghai has invisibly created an international speculative market. We should engage in production in a normal way, that is, to run more industries, run more factories, revive the countryside, eliminate speculation, eliminate improper commercial operations and illegal transactions, and then strengthen the controlled economy, and use the income from normal production for proper expenses. This is the only way to improve the production mechanism. However, now, affected by the war, the only normal production mechanism that exists has also been destroyed. If we want to revive it and promote it, the only way is to understand the benefits of the controlled economy. Superficially, people seem to have a layer of bondage to the controlled economy, but in fact the method of control is reasonable, regular, and scientific. It can promote the normal development of the production mechanism and it can also promote political progress on the right track.</p>
<p>Training in Normal Thinking We study the methods of ideological training for Chinese youth in the past, which can be said to have been completely used by politicians, so our corps adopts good organizations and eliminates bad methods of operation, and transforms the organizational law into flexible operation, successfully creating this unified and centralized organization, and implementing an action of absolute obedience and strict discipline to organize the youth, to train the youth. The goals of training our youth are: 1. We must be loyal to the country, 2. We must be loyal to our leaders, 3. We must be loyal to our duties, 4. We must have a courageous spirit, 5. We must have courageous actions, 6. We must have a clean spirit, 7. We must have the ability to know shame, 8. We must put the public before the private, 9. We must have a disciplined life, 10. We must seek self-reliance.</p>
<p>This youth, who bears the mission of peace, must cultivate a politically-minded training work under the principle of transcending national supremacy, and at the same time have the spirit of self-reliance in society and people's livelihood, maintain this useful body, and use it for the greatest path of saving the country. "As for the friendly relationship between our corps and the people of the Axis countries, especially Japan, they deeply sympathize with the fact that our corps is purely based on the people's position. They believe that the ideological expression of the people must be expressed by a purely people's organization, especially the youth organization, which must be led by pure and uncolored youth. I have been working on this movement for a year, spending countless efforts, and going through many arduous struggles.</p>
<p>After so many hardships, I showed the greatest fearless spirit to show the attitude of our corps, and finally gained the complete sympathy of all parties. Now our corps will soon be formally established. Recently, the Japanese Consulate and the Ministry of Information have repeatedly invited me, hoping that I will express the most solemn position as soon as possible, so today I will briefly tell you what is in my heart."</p>

<h3 id="e33">New Buyers Gather: Public Bonds Slowly Rise; Type A Reaches the Forty-Yuan Mark <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's unified public bond market continued the momentum of Saturday and rose slowly again. As soon as the morning session opened, everyone was in high spirits and new buyers gathered like clouds, so the opening prices of each bond were already high. However, in the middle of the session, large investors sold off, so Type C retreated from 9.20 yuan to below 9 yuan. However, because the overall momentum was very strong, even with the selling of large investors, buyers still purchased strongly, and were not shaken. Therefore, sellers found it difficult and retreated, and the market was temporarily controlled by buyers, resulting in a shortage of chips. As a result, each bond closed near its high price. Considering the strong foundation of each bond, they are expected to rise further. However, whether they can break through the 40-yuan mark for Type C is a turning point. If they break through and stand firm, then good prospects can be seen again. Otherwise, a retreat may be seen first, and then higher prices will be seen. The initial buying and selling for the whole city was absorbed by Tongli, Tongshun, and Hongda, etc., and high prices were seen. In the middle of the session, Tongyuan, Runde, and Fuhua made efforts, so there was a temporary small return. Soon, buyers continued their efforts, and their momentum did not abate. Each bond finally closed steadily. The turnover was about 2 million yuan. The list is shown below:</p>
<p>Shunchang Stock Company, which has been in preparation for a long time, officially opened today. Chen Runbiao is the manager.

<h3 id="e34">Chinese Stocks Have an Underlying Firm Momentum; New Pharmaceutical Stocks Are Especially Outstanding <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Chinese stock market had an underlying firm momentum. The reason is that the new creation of companies in this industry is like bamboo shoots after the rain. Before and after each company's opening, there will be absorption and bottoming out. After the New Share stocks were strictly investigated by the Association, they were not allowed to be traded on the market, resulting in a limited number of Old Share stocks and a distribution that was not easy to fill. Although there were some sellers seeking cash, the market price remained stable. The new pharmaceutical industry was particularly outstanding, with Xinya rising another half yuan, and Zhongfa and Minyi also making progress. The department store and cultural stocks fell first and then returned to flat. The Greater China Match Company has risen too much recently and has fallen by 2.5 yuan. Zhabei Water and Electricity has fallen by another yuan. The Chinese stock and other stock prices were stable. Considering that everyone is still in the wait-and-see period, here is another separate list of the market prices of each stock:</p>
<h3 id="e35">Spot Cotton Limited to Same-Day Delivery, Mill Cloth Transactions Slow, Prices Also Weakening <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Due to the continued decline in spot cotton yesterday, the internal and external interest in mill cloth was weak. Sales of coarse and fine cloth were few and far between, and prices also weakened accordingly, falling by two to three yuan per bolt. Sixteen-pound Earth brand cloth was priced at 175 yuan, Flying Goose at 173 yuan, nine-pound New Universe at 107 yuan, eight-pound Zhenzhong at 105 yuan, twelve-pound Earth fine cloth at 160 yuan, Dapeng at 150 yuan, Fugui fine twill at 130 yuan, Magnolia bleached cloth at 160 yuan, Qin Liangyu at 150 yuan, Longevity House silk at 5 yuan 8 jiao, Volleyball at 3 yuan 8 jiao and a half, and Three Sheep serge at 5 yuan 8 jiao, all showing no gains or losses. Only Peach Blossom Women's Lin cloth experienced alternating rises and falls, but transactions remained busy. The morning opening price was 259 yuan, rising to 261 yuan, but the market later saw a large player selling, causing the price to drop to 255 yuan and 7 jiao and a half, a drop of 5 yuan. The spot market for Dongbu yesterday issued a notice to all members, only allowing same-day delivery for transactions, resulting in a slight decrease in transactions. Prices continued to decline, with new orders for twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opening at 182 yuan and a half, falling to 177 yuan, and slightly rising to 178 yuan at noon, a decrease of 3 yuan and a half compared to last week. Bank orders were at 157 yuan and a half, Color Ball fine cloth at 162 yuan, Flying Fish at 160 yuan, Yanghe at 157 yuan, and Trumpet at 155 yuan. Four Gentlemen serge orders started at 7 yuan 2 jiao and a half, reaching a high of 7 yuan 3 jiao and a half, before falling to 7 yuan 1 jiao 4 fen. At the noon close, those covering short positions pushed prices up again to 7 yuan 2 jiao 2 fen, also a decrease of 1 jiao 2 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Horsehair Interlining Uniquely Strong <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>The woolen market remained uneventful yesterday. Most operators have regained their composure. It is reported that the official price limits from the authorities may be announced tomorrow. Meanwhile, horsehair interlining showed a uniquely strong trend. Twelve-inch interlining was offered at 6 yuan 5 jiao per yard, nine-inch at 5 yuan, and six-inch at 4 yuan. The goods are exceptionally scarce, because the horsehair is shipped from Tianjin, and now it has been cut off. Production has ceased, and the black carbon interlining is also in short supply, so a supply interruption is expected.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Gold Jewelry Exchange Rate Unchanged, Inter-dealer Prices Already Reduced <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, major gold shops in the city continued to quote the price for gold jewelry at 2,200 yuan per tael (deducting 350 yuan for purchases). Cash shops quoted the retail price at slightly under 50 yuan, totaling 2,150 yuan, and the purchase price at 1,950 yuan, a reduction of 300 yuan. The inter-dealer price started high in the morning at 30 yuan, at 1,950 yuan, but gradually declined amidst selling pressure, entering the 1,900 yuan level, and reaching 1,890 yuan at noon, a further reduction of 30 yuan compared to the previous day, with a difference of 60 yuan between high and low. Transactions were not heavy. Silver jewelry remained at 16 yuan, with the inter-dealer price around 11 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Military Note Settlements Still Frequent <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange market saw the inter-dealer price of Japanese military notes slightly rise to 5 yuan 5 jiao 6 fen 2 3 li, due to the continued settlement needs. Later, it was down to 5 yuan 5 jiao 5 fen 6 li, and finally to 5 yuan 5 jiao 5 fen 8 li. The retail price at banks and native banks retreated from 5 yuan 5 jiao 7 fen to 6 fen and a half, and the purchase price was 5 yuan 5 jiao 5 fen, it was said. Yesterday, the Shanghai Money Trade Association's overnight loan rate remained at 1 jiao 6 fen. New overdrafts and cash were trading at par, it was said.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Stable Situation for Grains <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Demand and supply for beans remained weak in bulk transactions. Broad beans arrivals decreased and tended to be more popular. Adzuki beans sales were good and trending up. Green beans were stable. Forty packages of Qingdao kidney beans were sold at 230 yuan. Fifty packages of Chongming sand broad beans were sold at 124 yuan. Another thirty packages of sand adzuki beans were sold at 163 yuan. More than twenty packages of Tianjin adzuki beans were sold at 163 yuan.</p>
<p>Soybean cakes were moving slowly and transactions were sparse. The market trend was stable. Two hundred pieces of February Wangu Stack soybean cake from Xianshengji were sold at 61 yuan.</p>
<p>The supply of dried sweet potatoes was seen as sparse, and retail sales were still active. The market trend was quite bullish. Yesterday, thirty packages of Jiangbei dried sweet potatoes opened at 110 yuan, self-delivery.</p>
<p>Bran demand turned sluggish, with some looseness among smallholders. The market trend was weakening. Yesterday, one hundred packages of Sanshin small-package bran for May Wangu Stack were offered at 100 yuan, a decrease of 3 yuan compared to the previous time.</p>

<h3 id="e41">The Tragedy of Coffee <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— Yangzijiang</p>
<p>According to news from telegraphs, the Brazilian government's Ministry of Commerce ordered the destruction of 75,000 bags of coffee to prevent prices from falling. The occurrence of such events is already alarming news, but today, such farces in human society, which are no longer uncommon, have become diluted because people are used to seeing them.</p>
<p>I remember not long ago, a certain coffee shop in this city made a "touching" advertisement, roughly saying: "The stock of imported coffee in Shanghai is dwindling. Noble people who want to enjoy the taste should come as soon as possible." Brazil artificially destroys a large amount of coffee, but people can't help but feel sorry for it.</p>
<p>However, people who have undergone careful and deep imagination and observation will surely understand that similar tragedies are constantly being staged in our vicinity. Aren't high-end restaurants discarding the leftovers after diners are drunk and full every day? On the other hand, aren't there many people who can't even get things that are inferior to these leftovers, and are starving? And more…</p>
<p>If you don't think about it, it's fine, but once you think about it, you feel that there are too many similar examples! It's just that we don't feel it keenly because of familiarity or numbness in our daily lives.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Casual Chat on Cooling Off <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— Luolü</p>
<p>Winter is a season that keeps people sitting in their houses, at least at night, while summer is the opposite. Although the sky is slowly darkening, the house is still like a furnace, making it impossible to stay inside. Therefore, after dinner, "cooling off" has become an indispensable part of daily life in the summer.</p>
<p>Just like some people have a habit of running around with their rice bowls while eating, some people also like to run around while cooling off, and refuse to stay in their own courtyards or outside their gates. Some people even carry a stool from afar and rush to the International Hotel in Bubbling Well Road, because it is said that the wind is particularly strong there. So you go, and I go. After seven o'clock, the sidewalks at the top of Park Road—under the Fuli Company and the 24-story building—are already full of people. A gust of wind comes, and everyone's mouths open in joy, smiling.</p>
<p>Because of the decrease in cars on the road this year, the general public's position on cooling off has also developed outwards. The sidewalks are full, so they implement the invasion of the road, sitting on the road—even lying on the road. Anyway, this year there won't be any cars driven by wives and young ladies from the concession hitting you.</p>
<p>Great China Road and McBain Road are the quietest during the day, but at night, many people regard them as "good places to cool off," because there they can not only enjoy several cool evening breezes, but also enjoy some wonderful music for free—the concerts from the New Celestial Forest and the Metropolitan are carried to your ears by the wind. The passionate Hawaii music and the songs of Miss China will make you enjoy listening very much.</p>
<p>In advertisements in newspapers, you can often see places that are "summer resorts." But those places are not for anyone to enter and enjoy the kind of coolness that seems to be unique to these "summer resorts." At least, to go to those places, in addition to "cooling off," you also have to spend some CRB. Those places are nothing more than coffee shops, garden dance halls, etc. Gentlemanly old men and modern young ladies are the ones who often go to those places to "cool off." Accompanying your lover to the rooftop garden of the G.G. Coffee Shop, or to the garden dance halls of Paramount, New Celestial Forest, and Lido. The "Summer Garden" on Jing'an Temple Road seems to be cooler, although it is purely a "garden" without a band, but relying on the transmission of the "microphone," you can sit outside and hear the Jazz music coming from the dance hall inside. If you feel "too cool" while sitting in those "summer resorts," then you can hire a companion girl to sit with you, perhaps her "enthusiasm" will prevent you from catching a cold "because it's too cool."</p>
<p>Although it is the same "cooling off," the difference in enjoyment between the rich and the poor cannot be measured in reason.</p>
<p>Constantly revealing the pain of thirst for life, the heavy pressure of life makes them immerse themselves in sweat and fatigue all day long, struggling with their weak bodies, raising their weak hands, and fighting the country of life. Their sweat, blood, and tears constitute the crystallization of an inch of cloth.</p>
<p>Summer will not stay in the factory forever; it will go and come back, and come back and go again, but what about human youth? This group of strugglers for survival let it be permanently buried in narrowness for the sake of life, and the idea of a vast life will never emerge again.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Summer in the Factory <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Ling Zuren</p>
<p>The friction heat of heavy machinery, the heat dissipation of the human body, the evaporation heat of the sun, heat, heat, heat everywhere!</p>
<p>The yarn blooms, the looms weave, interweaving into a roaring sound of primitive movement, bathing in the sweat and oil all day long, fully expressing the struggle for survival.</p>
<p>Summer puts a fiery coat on the earth, and it also stirs up an unusual floating heat in the factory. The friction heat of heavy machinery, the heat dissipation of the human body, and the scorching heat of the fierce sun decorate the factory with heat everywhere! The summer monsoon is also so stingy with its identity, and is not easily willing to visit, so the heat wave is even higher, and the mercury column of the thermometer is also rising wildly at eighty, ninety, almost reaching the boiling point.</p>
<p>There is no summer in the factory. Twelve hours of work a day, without relaxation. In the hot air, the noise of yarn blooms and looms still spreads, interweaving into a "rumble! rumble! bang! bang!" roaring sound of primitive movement, which is sluggish, heavy, and shocks people's senses, making people tired and bored.</p>
<p>Lurking in this sound, breathing also often brings the smell of sweat mixed with various oils to the nostrils. Grains and fine wool leap in the sunlight. The air is so turbid and suffocating.</p>
<p>But in order to conquer life, we have to bathe in this atmosphere all day long. On the lean and yellow faces of the familiar workers, the accumulated sweat shines with a glittering light. In those pairs of weak eyes that lack sleep,</p>

<p>(8) What Can Be Done</p>
<p>Second Madam Ye propped herself up in bed, hugging the lower half of her body with a blanket, and said, "Weicheng, sit down and talk." Weicheng sat on the edge of Second Madam Ye's bed, leaning sideways. Second Madam Ye said, "What you want to say to me now is something you don't want others to hear. You can close the door." Weicheng closed the door and sat back on the edge of the bed, scratching his temples and saying, "Aunt, I've made a trip for nothing." Second Madam Ye said, "What do you mean?" Weicheng shook his head, "It's hard to say in a word... Didn't my mother's will say that I could only take revenge after I had a son? This is really a difficult problem. After thinking about it, the most important thing to solve right now is the marriage problem. I'm afraid my aunt, as an outsider, sees things clearly and knows my thoughts. Recently, I have a very good impression of Guofang. I think we get along well, first of all. Secondly, Guofang understands everything about me. She told Sister Cuizhen last time that she already had a mother-in-law's family, but she was just joking. I'm really not afraid of what people say. When I think about doing this, I decide to do it, and I feel that the sooner I do it, the sooner Chuping will be at ease." Second Madam Ye nodded, "As for revenge, there's no need to mention it now. You have to think that your mother wrote this will, and she wouldn't give it to me or to you. Perhaps when she was dying, she had already changed her mind and didn't necessarily want you to take revenge. It's a great thing and the right thing to do that you can think about solving the marriage problem first. You didn't meet their siblings in Shuangqiao, but you did in Shanghai. What was the result?" Weicheng said, "I met their grandmother in Shuangqiao. I gathered my courage and asked her, 'Grand Aunt, I want to ask something I shouldn't ask. If Guofang becomes the daughter-in-law of the Ye family, does Grand Aunt think it's a good match?' Aunt, can you guess how this grandmother answered me? She said it frankly. She smiled and said, 'It's not only a good match, but it's also a perfect match. Good, good.' Aunt, that's why I took Axing and ran to Shanghai." (157)</p>

<p>— Luo Chen</p>
<p>Written for Scholarship Application Review</p>
<p>Due to a friend's relationship, I was able to see the screening test papers of students applying for scholarships. From this, I was inspired to write my opinions on the reading methods of general students today.</p>
<p>The questions are very practical. They test the students' degree of diligence in reading usually, and more importantly, they also test the students' degree of "digestion" of books, and whether they pay attention to daily life.</p>
<p>Most students have achieved the former (diligence in reading); while the latter, it is easier to be overlooked than the former.</p>
<p>Those test papers illustrate this point. Many students are still reading with old methods. They have not digested what they read. They have indeed spent a lot of effort on books, but they are wrong—they don't pay attention to life at all!</p>
<p>For example, most students can answer things that need to be memorized. There was an English question in the junior high school group, which was to write out the past tense and past participle of the verb. The errors in the test papers accounted for only about 10%, but it is obvious that this is the result of their usual rote memorization. Some people remember the sound very accurately, but misspell the letters.</p>
<p>Conversely, there are many errors in the common sense questions. One student wrote: The person who invented the theory of evolution was Xu Guangqi. Another said that the inventor of the theory of evolution was Sun Yat-sen, and the theory of relativity was invented by Roosevelt. Another wrote that the household rice quota for the third period was one liter of rice, half a liter of broken rice, and forty catties of flour—what a rich food supply!</p>
<p>For such things, general school teachers should bear a large part of the responsibility. Because teachers only want to test whether students have read books, they often use some so-called "niche" questions to stump students, so that students delve into the horns of a bull, but ignore the useful common sense related to daily life. Many students also do not know the freezing point and boiling point of thermometers (in fact, this is in junior high school physics, and even in elementary school science). I believe that if you ask general students: It was 102 degrees the hottest day before the last two days, why didn't the water boil? Isn't the boiling point of water 100 degrees? — There will definitely be many people who cannot answer.</p>
<p>Many people (including parents and students themselves) have a wrong concept, that is, they only care about upgrading every semester, and don't care whether it is digested or "absorbed." As a result, they only pay attention to exams and scores. During exams, they work hard, burn the midnight oil, memorize by force, and do not pay attention to real life at all.</p>
<p>A certain educator once said: Life is education, and society is a university. This is really a profound truth. We live in the 20th century today, and we are no longer in the era of the imperial examination. We must understand life from books and understand the world. This is the correct way to read.</p>
<p>Paying attention to life with books is inappropriate now!</p>
