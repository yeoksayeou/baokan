<p>本報特稿</p>
<h3>德國傘兵編小史（五）</h3>
<p>繼司坦達爾之後，別的傘兵學校也在德國次第設立起來，大多數在柏林以東不遭轟炸的地方，後來也有設在波蘭佔領區內的。祇有司坦達爾依舊是烏台脫的竉兒。其嚴緊的課程即係其所規劃，現在巳成爲傘兵學校的模範敎程了。五年來，幾萬名傘兵已在司坦達爾訓練完成。在十二所傘兵學校中，只有司坦達爾保持這個完美紀錄；雖有受傷學生，但從無一個致命的。其餘各校無不遭遇死傷。據記者所知，在某次公開演習中，曾有一名傘兵，因降落傘未能張開而跌斃。在克里特戰役中也有二十五人以同樣原因致死。</p>
<p>德國的傘兵必須從別的軍隊中選出。這是傘兵的第一個條件，也就是說，必須有初步軍事訓練始爲合格。</p>
<p>所有傘兵都嚴格規定是志願的。爲心理和士氣的緣故，顯然必須如此，而且也沒有別種方法能够在傘兵攻擊，間不容髪的瞬息中，使士兵有胆識，魄力，和體力智力上的自動精神。每一個人的安全，每一仗的勝利，都繫於當機立斷，不稍迎疑的行動；要達到這一步，無論是德國或別國的軍隊，只有從精選的志願兵裏訓練起來。德國降落傘部隊的威名現巳大著，以致候補人隊的人數，竟遠超出實際的需要。當初戈棘的第三營躊躇不願應募的情狀，德國軍官也都笑着承認，他們都說，那時候傘兵訓練還是一個未經人知和未經試騐的秘密，而且老於行伍的人，大都是不喜歡新花樣的啊！</p>
<p>開始的時候，爲使降落傘部隊成爲軍中足以誇耀的精兵，也曾集中宣傳於吸引志願兵。所以在特別權利上，在飲食上，在額外餉銀上，在所有軍隊中可以縱容的小地方，皆予傘兵以優待。</p>
<p>傘兵入伍必須經過各種心理的，敎育的，和體力的測騐，其所持原則和嚴厲程度與考試飛行員無異。檢查眩暈傾向的測驗尤其嚴格。從歷來測騐的結果，知道精於劇烈運動的人最爲適合，所以一九三二年和一九三六年出席世界運會的德國選手，實際上已全被降落傘部隊囊括而去。所有拳擊，籃球，擊劍，曲混球，游泳，跳水，和經賽運動中的大小明星，凡精神合格的，都在隊中。職業和業餘的騎師，也沒有例外的成了傘兵，星期日早晨在柏林跑馬塲上馳騁的健兒，幾乎完全是傘兵學校例假出營的學生。</p>
<p>騎術似乎使人特別的合適。著名的紳士派騎師，障礙賽優勝者，和馳譽國際的馬球員，都在軍官之列。其餘如足球名將，射擊好手，和國際競技中出過風頭的健兒，現在大概統在蘇聯上空張傘而戰了，自然，拳鬥錦標史墨林也在裏面。他在克里特戰役中，曾誤傳陣亡，其實只是見困於熱帶病罷了。</p>
<p>每名傘兵須先在司坦達爾或別的學校中受八星期特別訓練，然後正式編入伍。</p>
<p>訓練的第一項是學習降落傘摺疊法。他必須摺了又解，解了又摺，熟練到睡夢中都不會忘記才行。</p>
<p>第二項是訓練軍人的進取精神；士兵在重要的使命中往往突然發覺自己孤立無援，這時候就需要「堅强個性」的種種特質。我們叫牠做「斥候訓練」。</p>
<p>第三項是學習自動手槍的射擊技能。對於描準活動目標須有精熟和澈底的訓練，意在模擬乘傘降落時如何發射，次第的在地面上，在懸空時，在疾駛的汽車頂上，和在實際降落時作種種練習。</p>
<p>第四項是各種鍛鍊體格的運動，有體操，柔術，縱跳，打滾，翻觔斗，豁虎跳，越過障礙物，負重急跑，和前仆後仰直挺挺的倒下，初因軟墊，後來倒在地上。末後這一種欲倒不倒，似乎最難了。在學校的送藥紀錄上，凡受這項訓練的，即使是第一流職業運動家，都會身體瘦减。但是訓練結果使人動作非常敏捷，有如狸奴捕鼠。</p>
<p>第五項是練習迎風。用一種像降落傘樣的特製機器把學生懸在空中，迎面放一架大風扇，使知如何運動雙腿及搖擺身體，方順風向。此處所述各項練習，自然大都同時進行，前後亦間有重覆。</p>
<p>第五項是綏緩駛的汽車頂上練習躍下，自然不用降落傘。降落傘的原理是在阻止落體定律的實現。我們從物理學中知道一個落體在第一秒中落下十六呎，在第二秒中落下三十二呎，以後速度遞增，直到着地時方止，謂之終速，這終速是落體所達到的最高速度。物體的重量大小不同，終速也隨之而異。普通人體如聽其自由落下，可達每小時二百五十七哩的速度。用了降落傘不過是使落下的速度固定在最初的紀錄上，即每鐘十六呎。這就和從貨車頂上躍下的情形相同；但是用汽車練習更爲便利。不過，無論在何種塲合，着地時終不免劇烈震動，假使你未曾受過訓練的話，便會受到極危險的衝擊，常致折斷踝骨。往時商業航空雖未十分穩妥，但都不備降落傘，這就是一個原因。有了降落傘，乘客縱免一死，也不免成爲殘廢了。</p>

<h3>從平地跳上了電車</h3>
<p>— 蕪𠿑</p>
<p>公共汽車停駛兩日，電車生意格外興隆。若說安步當車，原是非常時期征服「行」字的不二法門，可是冬天的早晨，躺在暖洋洋的被窩裏，終究有些不忍遽起，於是本來打算可以早起「安步」的，至此便不得不更改計劃，而電車乃在「必坐」之列，其買座亦屬必然「滿堂」了。從平地跳上了電車，無異白日飛昇，脫離塵俗，進入仙界：不必背着二十磅重的厚呢大衣向前邁進；也不必迎着尖銳的西北風而弄得面紅耳赤；——並非飮酒後的現狀，乃是受着大自然中嚴厲處置的反應——儘可以閉着眼睛養一養神，忘却一切，擺脫跑路的煩惱。可是美景不常，你連帶也得準備接受新的沒趣哩。</p>
<p>究竟不像火車站月臺那麽寬暢，車廂中沒有法子擠進去，月臺上那裏還會有隙地，可供盤桓。於是身材瘦小的人，在月臺上受到大家擠軋的結果，往往他的身了會長出二三吋來——當然他的脚下已經失却「據點」——而在人叢中拿了角票，伸長了臂膀「請求」買票，也有舒筋長身之功呢！</p>
<p>好容易從口袋內檢出了一毛二分錢，在大衣中間扭轉了身子，從別人的頭上把票子「迎」了回來，於是在查票員檢票之前，多少身心可以暫時休息一下了。</p>
<p>「車上談話」比不上「爐邊談話」，不一定有結論，也不會有條理，偶爾聽之，偶而忘之可矣。昨天曾在電車月臺上恭聆一位CPC——不是咖啡的牌子，而是華捕的縮寫——的偉論。題目：「在擠軋的電車上應採取何種姿態？」解釋：所謂「姿態」者，係指身體之態度和姿勢而言。他因爲看見許多人受到擁擠的影響，甚至呼喊叫苦，未免有些不忍。於是吿訴大家道：「不要忘記把手護着胸膛。」接着他說：擠死人的原因，多由於胸部被壓迫，無從呼吸而起，如果能把兩隻手舉起來護着胸口，一方面能禦擋外來的壓迫，一方面又能用力抵抗，不致弄得英雄沒有用武之地。</p>
<p>他講話很費氣力，因爲他自身已經失却自由，被人家擠得透不過氣來。到了前面一站，車子停了，看見他果然奮不顧身的排開障礙，搶着下車。我因爲和他同一目的地，附驥在他之後，總算「平安着陸」。</p>
<p>我看見他右手空着，前後搖動，樣子很活潑；左手却提了一個飯盒子。</p>
<p>業餘漫譚</p>
<h3>目前的進修</h3>
<p>— 林峰</p>
<p>近來，碰到一些朋友當中，大家都顯着非常徬徨，對於什麽事情都是懶洋洋的；這當然還不能說他們的意志已經消沉，實際上他們被眼前的生活威脅着而暫時地失去理智是眞的。</p>
<p>最明顯的表現在業餘補習方面，許多人都自十二月八日後停頓起來，是不是以後不需要業餘補習呢？誰都不會作這樣想；顯然這種態度是錯誤的。</p>
<p>在目前的環境中，我們應該怎樣來進行業餘進修呢？</p>
<p>進補習學校，這是一條路，它曾經使許多人達到成功；因爲那面所學的比較有系統；同學多，多討論進步來得快；但這並不是唯一的路，它在目前講，還有着缺點，譬如許多科目同學生的實際需要還不能密切聯繫起來，因之，業餘進修的第二條路，就是自修。</p>
<p>我所說的自修，並不是獨個子來學習，而是說不進補習學校，以幾個同一種職業或同一個生產部門的朋友同事共同來進行自修，學習的科目可以根據大家的需要，工廠裏的職工可以硏究某種貨品的製造過程；銀行里的職員應該拿經濟金融來作硏究對象；辦理會計的人員應該提高自己的會計學識，而不祗侷促於一偶；其他如學習些一般的外國語，或者是算術地理歷史等等也都需要，在學習過程中，應該有信心及恒心，相互間嚴格督促，經濟與時間够得上而一面能够進補習學校的話，那當然是錦上添花了。</p>
<p>終之，我們不能放過每一秒鐘，我們應該充分的來利用現時期的比較空閒，來提高自己文化上和技術上的水平。</p>

<h3>介紹：「同人理髮社」</h3>
<p>— 谷舟</p>
<p>最近理髮的定價一再增加，較戰前幾有十倍之多，普通薪水階級對付這一頭頭髮似乎也成了問題，本埠北京路淸遠里五十號上海市錢兌業同業公會，有鑒於斯，爰集資組織一「同人理髮社」，雇有理髮師四人，日夜服務，編號入座。最近更擴大服務。歡迎外界非同人理髮，惟取費略高，同人理髮收費七角，非同人爲一元，包括洗頭，修面，吹風等亦應有盡有，不納小賬。然而較之一般理髮店便宜多多。</p>
<h3>吾盡吾心</h3>
<p>— 寥深</p>
<p>目今上海市面的蕭條，可謂愈趨愈烈，似有灘以爲繼之感，悲觀者已有「上海坍」的概念，然而不論其悲觀與否，人終是要生存下去的，如今惟宜全仗人力。人力相信可以挽回，則何必徒自嘆息。嘆息更頻添煩惱，祇有在艱難困苦之中想一點悲天憫人的方法才是正路；一般輿論的嘵嘵不絕，正不敢忽視現實，思有以謀得拯救之道，因此當局的勉爲其難，在民食治安方面，盡其種種大力，自然會有一貫的方針，切合民瘼，以蘇民困。「止，吾止也；往，吾往也！」愈趨蕭條困難，往往而是，不難理解，其人力則唯恐不絕如縷，虛應故事。好在當局再接再厲，當仁不讓，務使市民不絕於望。</p>
<p>目前麵粉緊急限價，搬運國米，毋須領證，就是若干例子；公共租界且已開始調查戶口頗有計口授糧之意，這是繁重的工作。在迅速進行中願切實注意所引起的弊端！</p>
<p>自然，不在編氓之列的，觳觫在街頭，路角，對於應付生活似更無人理睬，一時實難以計數，於農曆年終歲畢，在各業解散，結束，更多的情况下，更爲可驚。當然，大部份的他們就不能長留於此，不幸而爲餓莩，挺直在靜僻的路上，連衣服有時還給「同道」借光。</p>
<p>然而不得已而逗留於街頭者恐其數實多。曾子曰：「戒之，戒之。」吾於現實，何敢忽視？</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十六　靑春之火</p>
<p>湘綺也滿心以爲少華的秘密巳給自己完全盤問出來了，便不再追究下去，祗向他淡淡地警吿了一句：</p>
<p>「小心，不要為了學國語反把其他的功課全拋棄了！」</p>
<p>少華漲紅着臉，不知怎樣回答才好。可是經此一度謊騙以後，他的行動便格外自由了；因爲在湘綺的心裏，總以爲他所說的打乒乓是假話，跟那姓余的同學的表妹戀愛是眞話，反正年輕人總免不掉要有這一個過程的，所以便不再顧問他的事了。</p>
<p>這樣約模又過了二十多天。這一晚，大約十點鐘光景，湘綺已獨自回到房間去安歇了，突然聽得二樓那一間坐憇室裏起了一陣吵閙聲，有人在拍檯拍櫈的大駡，有人在哭泣，還有人在勸解，足足鬧了半個多鐘頭才安靜。</p>
<p>第二天，她首先發現少華的兩眼有些紅腫，神氣非常的苦悶，而裕華的臉上，却兀自帶着隔夜的餘怒。</p>
<p>「二妹，吿訴你吧！少華近來大大的變了！」吃過早飯，近玉便悄悄地吿訴湘綺：「這半個多月來，他天天在外面胡閙，非到十點鐘從不回家，我們因爲事情忙，也沒有注意他。直到昨兒晚上，你哥哥回來得早一些，恰好在門口碰見少華，心裏已有些不快，後來又發現他手上戴的一個金戒指跟一只金錶都不見了，再查他自己的零用錢，已經也化得一文不剩了。問他在什麽地方化掉的，他又抵死也不肯說，惹得你哥哥惱起來，便打了他一頓，從此不許他再在晚上走出去。」</p>
<p>湘綺聽了這一篇話，才知道，上次少華跟他說的簡直全是謊話，因爲在同學家裏結識一個正正經經的女朋友是無論怎樣不會化這許多錢的。</p>
<p>「旣然道樣，讓我好好地去勸勸他吧！」　（三〇六）</p>

<h3>Japanese Tank Units Plunge into Johor: The Malayan War Situation Worsens; Australian Troops Enter Frontline Combat for the First Time</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Haitong News Agency) - Yesterday, Japanese tank units entered Johor. Today’s reports from the Malayan front are fewer than yesterday’s. Currently, Japanese forces are acting swiftly, so details of military activities are not being disclosed to avoid informing the enemy. This afternoon, the tank vanguard pursued Scottish troops, numbering approximately six hundred, fleeing along the Malayan highway towards Singapore. All were dispersed, it is said.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 16th (Haitong News Agency) - British reports state that Australian troops have entered the Malayan war. This is the first time Australian troops have fought in Singapore.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Domei News Agency) - News from the Malayan front reports that Japanese forces are about to launch a large-scale pincer attack on British troops retreating towards central Johor. The Japanese right flank, advancing directly along the western coast of Johor, crossed the Muar River at 5:00 PM yesterday and has occupied a key point south of the river. It is reported that this route of Japanese forces advanced twenty miles south from the Johor-Malacca border yesterday. San Francisco radio reports that British troops have retreated to Batu Pahat (sixty miles north of Singapore). The main force of Japanese troops entering central Johor is advancing south along the Gemas highway, fiercely attacking British troops. The British troops are desperately resisting with mortars and heavy field artillery, but a portion of Japanese forces are flanking them, penetrating deeper into Johor.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Haitong News Agency) - The Imperial General Headquarters Army Department announced yesterday that Japanese forces, pursuing retreating enemy troops in Malaya, reached Malacca city on Wednesday night. Further news reports that Malacca and Gemas cities are now behind the Japanese lines.</p>
<p>Singapore, 15th (Reuters) - According to an official announcement, Australian troops entered the frontline combat in eastern Negeri Sembilan yesterday, but this is still primarily reconnaissance and skirmishing. Heavy rain has been pouring down in recent days, and many sections of the main roads have been washed away, making it very difficult to transport large units and military supplies.</p>
<p>Singapore, 16th (Havas News Agency) - The news that Australian troops have now joined the battle for Singapore has brought a sense of relief here. The general public expects that the strength to resist the Japanese will increase as a result, and it is believed that the General Headquarters is planning to launch a counterattack. However, the various transportation difficulties cannot be resolved immediately, especially after the heavy rain, the ground is a sea of water, and even entire sections of roads are submerged.</p>
<p>Singapore, 16th (Reuters) - The claim that Japanese forces in Malaya have entered Johor has not been confirmed today. According to the Singapore Gazette, British troops have had some contact with Japanese forces on the frontlines, but the overall war situation remains unchanged. Japanese forces in the Negeri Sembilan area, aided by bombers and fighter planes, attacked the vanguard of British troops. The British Far East Command bombers attacked flat-bottomed boats in Sungai Rengit and targets in Sungai Pataani, but due to poor weather, the bombing results could not be observed. Japanese planes attacked Singapore.</p>
<p>Singapore Continues to Suffer Air Raids</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Domei News Agency) - The General Headquarters announced at 12:45 PM today that Japanese bombers and fighter planes carried out the fourth daytime bombing of the Tengah Airfield in Singapore yesterday morning at 11:45 AM, destroying seven bombers. Thirteen enemy planes took off to intercept, of which seven were shot down.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Domei News Agency) - The General Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM today that Japanese naval aircraft carried out the fifteenth bombing of the Tengah Airfield in Singapore and other military facilities yesterday, causing significant ground losses.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 15th (Reuters) - An official announcement states that food supplies are plentiful in Singapore and various parts of Malaya, and passive defense work is very complete. Chinese and Indian people are assisting in maintaining order, and the general situation of Singapore residents is particularly satisfactory. Indian women and children have priority to board ships heading to India.</p>
<p>British People Feel Extremely Anxious</p>
<p>London, 16th (Reuters) - The British people are extremely anxious about the very serious military threat to Singapore. News of victories from other theaters of war is diminished as a result, and because war news is scarce, what is seen has already been strictly censored or is enemy information, which only increases public anxiety. Very little is known about the British troops in Malaya. Well-informed sources believe that British troops are currently withdrawing from vast areas to defend the shorter Johor-Pahang lines. Tokyo announced that Japanese forces are advancing on three routes in west, central, and eastern Malaya, have occupied Malacca and entered Johor, and have surrounded approximately 30,000 British troops, but this has not been confirmed. Newspapers are criticizing the scarcity of war news, saying that the official silence, intended to prevent information from being supplied to the Japanese, is inappropriate and gives the public a very unpleasant impression.</p>
<h3>Japan Intensifies Encirclement Strategy of the Dutch East Indies; Japanese Forces Build Bases in the Philippines; Fierce Fighting in the Mountains of Borneo</h3>
<p>Saigon, 16th - According to Batavia sources, two hours after General Wavell arrived in the Dutch East Indies, the Dutch East Indies army launched a fierce counterattack. Fierce fighting is underway in the mountains of Borneo. According to well-informed sources in the Dutch East Indies, many ammunition depots are buried underground, so Japanese aircraft cannot bomb them. These munitions were placed by far-sighted Dutch East Indies officers.</p>
<p>Bangkok, 16th (Haitong News Agency) - According to U.S. military reports, Japanese forces are currently building new bases on Jolo and Mindanao in the Philippines. The movements of Japanese forces seem intended to prepare for an attack on the Dutch East Indies before the Allied command headquarters is established. Their main objective may be to conquer the outer territories of the Dutch East Indies, or at least cut off external assistance to Java. The bombing of Kolonial, Balikpapan, Ambon by Japanese aircraft, the occupation of Tarakan, and the threat to Minahasa seem to be symbols of implementing this strategy. Currently, what the Allies urgently need are heavy bombers and fighter planes to protect their Southwest Pacific front. It is expected that the Dutch East Indies Vice Governor, Mock, will urge the United States to quickly send air force reinforcements to the Southwest Pacific.</p>
<p>Saigon, 16th (Haitong News Agency) - Reports from Batavia state that according to well-informed sources in Batavia, yesterday's communique from the Dutch East Indies General Headquarters subtly revealed that Japanese forces are concentrating in Borneo and Celebes, intending to attack two other points in the East Indies. The targets of their attack may be Balikpapan on the east coast of Borneo and Ambon Island in southeastern Celebes. In the past, when Japanese forces were about to occupy a place, they would first bomb it with air force, followed by naval cover for ground troops to land. Ambon Island happens to be an Australian air base, so it is very likely to be attacked by Japanese forces. If Japanese forces land there, the supply route between Australia and Java will be seriously threatened. Authoritative sources believe that Japan must be very aware of this, so in the past five weeks, Japanese aircraft have frequently bombed Ambon Island. However, if Japanese forces attack Ambon Island, their transportation lines will greatly increase, so the Japanese will face a very different situation than when attacking Tarakan Island, which has no defensive forces. Although Dutch East Indies personnel did not explicitly state the strength of the defensive forces on Ambon Island, they hinted that Japanese forces will encounter unexpected resistance if they attack the island. Regarding Balikpapan in Borneo, Dutch East Indies military personnel believe that when Japanese forces attack the area, their ships must first pass through the very narrow Makassar Strait. The Dutch East Indies had long anticipated that Japanese forces would pass through the strait, so the defenses are quite elaborate, which is a major difficulty for the Japanese. In addition to the dense minefields, there are also fifty newly built secret airfields, which are sufficient to seriously threaten the Japanese naval fleet that risks passing through the Makassar Strait. Dutch East Indies observers point out that the Dutch East Indies are deliberately holding back in order to thwart Japan's desire to control the Pacific when the opportunity arises. In addition, a large number of reinforcements are being prepared in the United States and are ready to be dispatched at any time to cope with any offensive.</p>
<p>Two Locations in Sumatra Bombed</p>
<p>Batavia, 16th (Reuters) - A communique issued here today stated that Japanese aircraft bombed the army and air force base in Medan (Sumatra) and the Ambon naval and air force base today.</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops Protect Malaya but are Rejected by Britain; British Parliament Members Plan to Question the Government</h3>
<p>London, 16th (Reuters) - Lord Strabolgi, a member of the House of Lords, declared yesterday that when Parliament reconvenes, he will question the government in the House of Lords as to why it rejected the proposal by China's Chairman Chiang to send Chinese troops to protect Malaya. According to observations from Parliament, the focus of discussions when the two houses reconvene will be on the Far East situation. Judging from the dissatisfaction of the parliament members, the nature of the discussion may be a demand for investigation into the lack of military preparation in that area, the scope of which may be comparable to the setbacks suffered in the operations at Narvik and Crete. Furthermore, a telegram from a "Daily Mail" correspondent in Malaya, exposing the corruption in Singapore, has already become a topic of conversation in London, and members of Parliament are increasingly indignant as a result.</p>
<h3>Chinese in London Warn Britain to Quickly Adopt Effective Measures to Cope with the Far East War Situation</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 15th (Havas News Agency) - A Geneva Daily Tribune correspondent in London recently telegraphed that Chinese in London have issued a serious warning to Britain, stating that if the Allied authorities do not take timely and effective measures, Japanese forces will continue to advance westward and make contact with German forces. If that happens, not only will all supplies to China be in danger of being cut off, but also to the Soviet Union. At the same time, Australians in London, in light of the inadequate defenses of Singapore, are openly criticizing the British General Headquarters. The Australian High Commissioner to the UK gave a radio address yesterday, proposing that the Dominions expand their participation in British Cabinet decision-making and urging the adjustment of various intelligence matters in order to make military plans based on them. It is said that the Dominions must not only send representatives to participate in the Imperial War Cabinet, but also assign key personnel to participate in economic supply and the allocation of various important agencies. These personnel should participate in planning imperial policy, not only participating in decision-making at the final stage, but also providing appropriate adjustments during its formative stages.</p>

<h3>U.S. Representative Proposes Organizing United Front Against Axis Powers; American Countries Should Strengthen Economic Ties and Jointly Guard Against the Enemy Stabbing Us in the Back</h3>
<p>Opening Day of the Pan-American Conference</p>
<p>Rio de Janeiro, 16th (Havas) - After the opening of the Pan-American Conference yesterday, Bolivian Prime Minister Medina proposed unanimously electing Brazilian Foreign Minister Aranha as Chairman of the Conference. Foreign Minister Aranha then delivered a speech, strongly asserting that the successive fall of invaded countries was due to the failure of countries to unite in time. He said, "The fate of these invaded countries has set a tragic example. We in the Americas must understand how to save future generations, and we must make sacrifices." U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles then spoke (see separate telegram for the speech). Afterwards, Uruguayan Foreign Minister Guani delivered a speech denouncing isolationists and strongly asserting that it is impossible for the American continent to remain neutral in the current war. Today's meeting is related to the fate of mankind, so I advocate establishing an information exchange agency and organizing a special police force to crack down on the Fifth Column. "In my opinion, why don't we formulate a joint resolution declaring that South American countries sever diplomatic relations with invading countries? There is no reason to treat them as non-belligerent countries. We should regard all invaded countries as non-belligerent countries." Finally, Mexican representative Padilla spoke, expounding on the ideal of freedom and expressing regret that some American countries have not been able to obtain the strong support of other American countries.</p>
<p>Rio de Janeiro, 15th (Havas News Agency) - The chief representative of the United States to the Pan-American Conference, U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles, delivered a speech at the opening of the conference today, strongly urging Latin American countries to sever diplomatic and economic relations with the Axis powers. He said, "The United States has no intention of interfering with the position of the Latin American republics. However, we believe that no country in the Americas can allow its territory to be used by Axis personnel as a preparation for attacking American countries. The United States is currently engaged in a war against aggression. All Axis personnel who are still enjoying privileges under the guise of diplomatic personnel should be expelled from the Western Hemisphere. American countries should also stop commercial and financial dealings with invading countries. "Our duty is first to prevent the enemy from stabbing us in the back when we are unprepared. It is also extremely important for your country to mobilize all shipping tools to ensure the smooth transportation of raw materials needed by the American war industry. If Latin American countries suffer losses as a result of cooperating with the United States, the United States will definitely compensate them. Therefore, the United States has already organized a special committee to facilitate exports to South American countries, and will still supply the American countries with rayon, chemicals, and machinery to reduce the panic caused by the disruption of normal commercial channels."</p>
<p>Calling for Unity</p>
<p>Rio de Janeiro, 15th (United Press) - At the opening of the Pan-American Conference, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Welles proposed that the Western Hemisphere eliminate all Axis activities. Welles declared that there is no real neutrality today. Welles did not point out Argentina when making this statement. Welles continued to discuss U.S.-Japan talks, stating that the United States refused to accept any solution that would undermine the independence and legitimate rights of the Chinese people. Regarding the European war, he said that Hitler has lost one-third of his air force strength, one-half of his tanks, and over three million soldiers. Welles urged the participating countries to pay attention to the reasons for the collapse of European countries, stating that European countries failed to unite and were defeated one by one. Welles also said that 1942 will be a turning point in the era.</p>
<p>First Meeting</p>
<p>Rio de Janeiro, Havas News Agency - The Pan-American Conference held its first meeting at 11:00 AM today. Representatives from twenty-one Pan-American republics attended and immediately reached an important decision. The chief representatives of each country unanimously agreed to elect Brazilian Foreign Minister Aranha as Chairman of the Conference and decided to form two committees to study economic issues and the joint defense of the American continent separately. Representatives from all countries participated.</p>
<p>Rio de Janeiro, 15th (Havas News Agency) - After the Pan-American Conference opened here today, responsible sources stated that the conference will close on January 26th.</p>
<p>Outside Meetings</p>
<p>Rio de Janeiro, 15th (Havas News Agency) - Well-informed sources here stated that representatives from Pan-American countries began talks here today. The result may be that all South American countries decide to sever diplomatic relations with the Axis powers. This decision was originally desired by the United States and agreed to by Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela, but Argentina has expressed opposition. Argentine Foreign Minister Guani held repeated talks here today with U.S. Secretary of State Welles, the chief representative of the United States to the Pan-American Conference. Afterwards, according to reliable sources, Foreign Minister Guani explained his country's attitude, stating that Argentina will continue to oppose American countries severing diplomatic relations with the Axis powers and taking any measures of a "quasi-belligerent" nature. Apart from the unofficial expression from the U.S. representative that he hoped that the Argentine representative would not take attitudes that would be contrary to the unified relations of the Pan-American countries, Santo Domingo has also put forward a proposal advocating that American countries jointly declare war on Germany, Italy, Japan, and their allies. This proposal is often discussed in private talks outside of the meetings separately and will not be included in the agenda of the general meeting. So far, only eight or nine countries have supported this proposal. It is expected that the conference will decide to establish a Pan-American Special Committee to adjust all issues related to the common interests of American countries in political, economic, and military terms. This committee can be established once all countries have signed the "Collective Security Agreement." This Collective Security Agreement was proposed by Brazil to the Pan-American Conference in 1936 but was rejected by the conference. Under the current circumstances, this proposal may reconcile the opinions of several American republics, so it will likely be brought up again.</p>
<h3>U.S. Reinforces Hawaii Island; Prepares for Long-Term War; Naval Command and Management Matters to be Shared by Admiral Stark and Admiral King</h3>
<p>Honolulu, 16th (Havas News Agency) - An army spokesperson recently stated that large numbers of soldiers and military equipment are now being shipped to the Hawaiian Islands. The islands will be placed on a war footing to cope with a long-term war.</p>
<p>Washington, 16th (Havas News Agency) - Secretary of the Navy Knox recently stated that Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark and Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Fleet Admiral King will share responsibility for naval command and management. Because Admiral Stark’s responsibilities are so heavy and large, it is more than one person can handle, so Admiral King had to share some of the responsibility. Admiral King is responsible for naval operations, while Admiral Stark still manages naval administration and researches future operational plans.</p>
<h3>China, United States, Britain, and Netherlands Organize Military Committee; Headquarters to be Located in Washington; Dill to Serve as Liaison Officer</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 15th (Domei News Agency) - According to news from London today, U.S. President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill plan to organize a Pacific Military Committee, with representatives from the United States, Britain, China, and the Netherlands as members. The headquarters will be located in Washington. Former British Chief of Staff General Dill will not take up his new position as Governor of Bombay, to remain in Washington as a liaison officer.</p>
<p>Rome, 15th (Havas News Agency) - "Il Giornale d'Italia" published an article today, stating that "Britain and the United States have already formulated a battle plan, the content of which is to first deal with Germany and Italy with all their strength, and then attack Japan. Therefore, the fate of Australia, the Dutch East Indies, and China will be left to nature, and will be subject to the outcome of the Atlantic and Mediterranean wars. This is because Britain and the United States cannot simultaneously confront the Axis powers on two fronts, and hope to solve them one by one. However, Germany, Italy, and Japan have already seen through this intention, so they have decided to deal with it in a unified manner. In other words, they will do everything in their power to fight without stopping, to ensure that Britain and the United States cannot implement their plan to defeat them one by one. The Axis powers will continue to exert pressure on the Mediterranean, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans, and adjust their military actions and combat resources to continuously threaten the supply lines of Egypt, the Yangtze River, and the Indian Ocean."</p>

<p>Macau, 16th (Haitong News Agency) - Reports received here today from Kunming stated that Chinese overseas residents in Burma are rushing to retreat to Yunnan, with the number reaching two million. The Kunming branch of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of China has been busy for days. The Yunnan Provincial Government has designated Cheli, Fohai, and Simao as areas for settling returning overseas Chinese. This area is close to the Burmese border, covers an area of approximately 1,700 mu, has fertile land, and has a warm climate, making it very suitable for cultivation. In addition to settling returning overseas Chinese, the work of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission also encourages overseas Chinese to invest in the country. In the two days of Monday and Tuesday, the Kunming branch of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission received several million yuan in remittances from overseas Chinese. In order to facilitate the return of overseas Chinese, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has established two registration stations in Baoshan and Wanting, and has established an evacuation bureau in Mengzi to guide evacuation matters.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Students Returning to China to be Granted Loans</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 16th - After the outbreak of the Pacific War, maritime traffic was blocked and postal services were restricted, making it very difficult for overseas remittances to return to China. The Ministry of Education and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission are concerned that financial assistance to overseas Chinese students returning to China to study in various places will become a problem, so they have consulted on relief measures and approved the issuance of loans based on the treatment of students in domestic war zones. It is said that the ministry has issued instructions to universities and middle schools across the country.</p>

<h3>A Short History of German Paratroopers (5)</h3>
<p>Following Stendal, other paratrooper schools were gradually established in Germany, mostly in areas east of Berlin that were not bombed, and later some were also established in occupied areas of Poland. Only Stendal remained Udet's favorite. Its rigorous curriculum, planned by him, has now become the model curriculum for paratrooper schools. Over the past five years, tens of thousands of paratroopers have completed training at Stendal. Among the twelve paratrooper schools, only Stendal has maintained this perfect record; although there have been injured students, there has never been a fatality. All other schools have experienced deaths and injuries. As far as the reporter knows, during a public drill, one paratrooper fell to his death because his parachute failed to open. Twenty-five people also died for the same reason during the Battle of Crete.</p>
<p>German paratroopers must be selected from other troops. This is the first condition for a paratrooper, meaning that they must have initial military training to be qualified.</p>
<p>All paratroopers are strictly required to be volunteers. For psychological and morale reasons, this is obviously necessary, and there is no other way to give soldiers the courage, willpower, and physical and mental spontaneity needed during the split-second moments of a paratrooper attack. The safety of each person and the victory of each battle depend on decisive and unwavering action; to achieve this, whether in the German or other countries' armies, it can only be achieved by training from carefully selected volunteers. The prestige of the German parachute troops is now so great that the number of candidates far exceeds the actual needs. German officers also laughingly admit that Goering's Third Battalion hesitated to enlist in the beginning, saying that at that time, paratrooper training was still an unknown and untested secret, and most veteran soldiers did not like new things!</p>
<p>In the beginning, in order to make the parachute troops a proud elite in the army, propaganda was also focused on attracting volunteers. Therefore, paratroopers were given preferential treatment in special rights, in food, in extra pay, and in all the small things that can be tolerated in the army.</p>
<p>Paratrooper enlistees must undergo various psychological, educational, and physical tests, with principles and rigor no different from the examinations for pilots. The test for susceptibility to dizziness is particularly strict. From the results of past tests, it is known that people skilled in vigorous sports are most suitable, so the German athletes who attended the World Games in 1932 and 1936 have actually all been included in the parachute troops. All boxing, basketball, fencing, hockey, swimming, diving, and major and minor stars in track and field events, who are mentally qualified, are in the team. Professional and amateur jockeys have also become paratroopers without exception. The athletes who gallop on the Berlin racecourse on Sunday mornings are almost entirely students on leave from the paratrooper school.</p>
<p>Horsemanship seems to make people particularly suitable. Famous gentleman riders, obstacle course winners, and internationally renowned polo players are all among the officers. Others such as famous football players, shooting experts, and athletes who have been in the spotlight in international competitions are probably all fighting over the Soviet Union with parachutes now. Of course, boxing champion Schmeling is also in there. He was rumored to have been killed in action during the Battle of Crete, but in fact, he was just trapped by tropical diseases.</p>
<p>Each paratrooper must first undergo eight weeks of special training at Stendal or other schools before being formally enlisted.</p>
<p>The first item of training is to learn the parachute folding method. He must fold and unfold it, unfold and fold it, until he is so familiar with it that he will not forget it even in his sleep.</p>
<p>The second item is training in military initiative; soldiers often suddenly find themselves isolated and helpless in important missions, which requires the qualities of a "strong personality." We call it "scout training."</p>
<p>The third item is to learn the shooting skills of the automatic pistol. There must be thorough training in aiming at moving targets, intending to simulate how to fire when descending by parachute, with various exercises performed gradually on the ground, in suspension, on top of speeding cars, and during actual landings.</p>
<p>The fourth item is various physical exercises, including gymnastics, jujutsu, jumping, rolling, somersaulting, tiger leaping, overcoming obstacles, weighted sprinting, and falling straight forward and backward, first on soft mats and later on the ground. The last of these, where you seem to fall but don't quite, seems the most difficult. According to the school's medical records, even top professional athletes will lose weight after receiving this training. However, the result of the training makes people extremely agile, like a cat catching a mouse.</p>
<p>The fifth item is practicing against the wind. A special machine that looks like a parachute is used to suspend the student in the air, and a large fan is placed in front of him to let him know how to move his legs and sway his body to follow the wind direction. The exercises described here are of course mostly carried out simultaneously, with some repetition.</p>
<p>The fifth item is practicing jumping off the top of slowly moving cars, naturally without a parachute. The principle of the parachute is to prevent the realization of the law of falling bodies. We know from physics that a falling body falls sixteen feet in the first second, thirty-two feet in the second second, and then the speed increases until it stops upon landing, which is called the terminal velocity. The terminal velocity varies depending on the weight of the object. If a normal human body is allowed to fall freely, it can reach a speed of two hundred and fifty-seven miles per hour. Using a parachute merely fixes the falling speed at the initial record, i.e., sixteen feet per minute. This is the same as jumping off the top of a truck, but it is more convenient to practice with a car. However, no matter what the occasion, there is always a violent vibration upon landing, and if you have not been trained, you will suffer a very dangerous impact, often breaking your ankles. In the past, commercial aviation, although not very safe, did not provide parachutes, and this is one reason. With a parachute, passengers may avoid death, but they will inevitably become disabled.</p>

<h3>Second Withdrawal from Eight Banks Starts Next Week, Chartered Bank Issues Withdrawal Regulations</h3>
<p>Apart from HSBC, which started the "second withdrawal" on the 14th due to the rapid completion of liquidation work, the remaining eight Allied banks will also be allowed to implement the "second withdrawal" starting next Monday. The withdrawal rate has been decided by the authorities. The Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China issued seven regulations on the method of withdrawal for next week, which were posted at the bank's entrance yesterday.</p>
<p>Seven Items of Second Withdrawal Method</p>
<p>Starting next week, each depositor can withdraw 2,000 yuan from the deposit balance on December 6th, which is the "first withdrawal" amount. Each depositor can withdraw 50% from the current deposit balance (i.e., the balance on December 6th minus 2,000 yuan), which is the "second withdrawal". Already withdrawn deposits must be deducted from the above withdrawal amount. The remaining half of the deposit has been transferred to Mitsui Bank to open an account, but all future transactions will still be handled by this bank. The following deposits will be temporarily frozen: (A) Deposits of Chinese people exceeding 10,000 yuan, pending a decision by the Japanese authorities on the depositor's integrity. (B) Deposits of depositors who owe debts to this bank, pending the clearance of the debt. Depositors whose deposits have been transferred (i.e., those who have opened new accounts at Mitsui Bank) must immediately bring their checkbooks to Mitsui Bank to stamp them with the "Mitsui Bank Deposit" seal. Citizens of England, America, the Netherlands, and Belgium will still be subject to the previous restrictions on withdrawing new deposits from Mitsui Bank.</p>
<p>New Deposits Accepted Regardless of Nationality</p>
<p>Deposits of citizens of other countries will not be restricted. As for new deposits made by depositors at Mitsui, they can be added at will, regardless of their nationality. According to these withdrawal regulations, if a depositor had 100,000 yuan deposited at the Chartered Bank on December 6th, and has since withdrawn 2,000 yuan, the remaining 98,000 yuan will have half transferred to Mitsui Bank for payment. If the depositor is a citizen of a country at war with Japan, Mitsui Bank will pay the depositor no more than 2,000 yuan per month. If they are citizens of other countries, they can immediately withdraw all 49,000 yuan from Mitsui Bank. Another 49,000 yuan will be retained at the Chartered Bank pending a decision on how to handle it.</p>
<h3>General Police Department Captures Large Number of Suspected Thieves</h3>
<p>Yang Zhaoqing, Zhu Wanjun, Zhao Lianbi, Chinese detectives of the General Police Department, and detectives Ma Guangqi, etc., arrested a large number of suspected male and female thieves in Fuxi Road, Room 264 of Zhenhua Hotel in Fuzhou Road, Room 424 of Grand Shanghai Hotel in Avenue Edward VII, Room 216 of Continental Hotel in Yu Qiaqing Road, and Room 21 of New Year Hotel in Avenue Edward VII, including Wang Chunlin, Cai Sheng, Zhang Huishu, Zhu Daoxiang, Liang Hong (aka He Ming), Ma Wenzhong, Wu Derong, Jiang Jiajun, Chen Abao, Wu Dexing (aka Wu Yongyuan), Zou Xirong, Xu Zhonghua, Gao Jinsheng, Feng Adong, Hu Zhenfu, Wang Shifang, Chen Yixin, Li Yingzu, Zhou Shiming, Zhang Zhongji, Wang Zhiguang, and women Li Yinghua, Zhou Xiuying, Zhu Lili, Chen Meiyun (all belonging to the Central and Gaofeng dance halls), a total of 25 people. They seized a pistol, three bullets, and a hand grenade, and brought them all to the police station to be detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special District. Police lawyer Peng Qixin stated the case and requested detention. Judge Feng ruled that all the arrested criminals should be detained for two weeks for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Principles for Opening Warehouses of Various Banks and Qianzhuang Have Been Approved, but Goods Must Be Applied for in Advance, Employee Rice Regulations Specify the Amount to be Withdrawn</h3>
<p>The opening of warehouses of various banks and qianzhuang has been discussed between the various banks and qianzhuang and the authorities. All goods stored in the warehouses have been inventoried and submitted for review. It is heard that the opening principle has been approved, but it must be applied for and approved in advance. For example, foreign rice and flour stored in the warehouses of China, Zhejiang Xingye, Donglai, JinCheng, etc., have been approved for extraction. The rice needed by the employees of various banks and qianzhuang has been approved for extraction, with the regulation that each person is three dou and nine sheng per month.</p>
<h3>320,000 Yuan of Cash Robbed on the Road, Police and Robbers Fight Fiercely in North Henan Road, One Thief Shot Dead on the Spot, Five Thieves Flee with Loot, Pregnant Woman Chen Lirong Seriously Injured by Stray Bullet</h3>
<p>Chen Wenquan, owner of Tianbao Silk Store at No. 5 Ciyi Lane, Jiujiang Road, Public Concession, dispatched four employees yesterday morning to collect a large sum of 320,000 yuan which was remitted from Nanjing, transported by train to Shanghai. The four employees went as scheduled.</p>
<p>Packed in Boxes</p>
<p>They hired rickshaws from the North Railway Station to return to the store. Unexpectedly, when the rickshaws reached the intersection of Hainan Road and North Henan Road, six robbers suddenly appeared, four of whom drew box cannons, blocked the way, and robbed all the leather boxes before fleeing in different directions. The employees, anxious about the loss of the large sum of money, urgently called the police. Patrolman No. 374 heard the noise and rushed to chase the robbers. The robbers took the initiative to open fire and resist arrest. The patrolman also fired back. The gunfire erupted, and pedestrians fled in panic. Patrol teams No. 902, 1818, 760, 3199, 339, etc., of the patrol division were patrolling nearby and joined the pursuit, firing at the robbers.</p>
<p>Bullets Like a String of Pearls</p>
<p>As a result, one robber was shot several times and fell dead in front of No. 279 Avenue Edward VII. The remaining robbers managed to escape. The police station had also received a report and dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to rush to the scene. The dead robber was sent to the morgue, and the box cannon in his hand was taken back to the police station. When the police and robbers were engaged in a gun battle, a female pedestrian, Chen Lirong (21 years old, resident of No. 88 Barton Road, currently working at Huachiao Sawmill at No. 5 Avenue Edward VII), was hit in the abdomen by a stray bullet. She was sent to Pazier Road Sanitarium for treatment. The woman was also six months pregnant. After the doctor performed surgery, the fetus was removed, but the woman's life is still in critical condition.</p>
<h3>Funding for Flood Prevention Plan This Spring is Problematic</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Council's 4 million yuan flood prevention plan started on September 17th last year, part of the work has been completed. However, due to the difficulty in raising funds, the Municipal Council will soon hold discussions. The plan stipulates that one-tenth of the 4 million yuan funding should be used for preparatory work last year to prepare manufacturing tools such as pumps. It is also scheduled to start civil engineering construction at the beginning of this year, aiming to complete the entire plan before the rainy season this year. Various pumps have been ordered, and the single-line drainage gate project is also progressing smoothly. If funding is available, flooding can be avoided this spring.</p>
<p>Shenbao Readers' Scholarship Fund Application Started Yesterday, Dazhong Typing Training School Donates 15 Free Places</p>
<h3>Yesterday was the first day of application for the Shenbao Readers' Scholarship Fund. Students from major and minor schools flocked to the office to obtain application forms. From morning to night, there were more than 1,000 people. This enthusiastic situation broke the past record, showing that students are eager to learn and reflecting the large number of impoverished children in Shanghai society and the urgent need for people from all walks of life to help with their studies. However, some people still do not understand the application procedures and send letters to request forms or arbitrarily ask others to collect them on their behalf, which is not serious enough. It is hoped that no more letters will be sent to request forms in the future. If there are unavoidable circumstances, please attach postage.</h3>
<p>Dazhong Typing Training School, No. 405 Tianjin Road, sent a letter donating a total of five free places for Chinese typing and ten for English typing, asking this newspaper to recommend and send students to benefit diligent students. This is worthy of praise. It is hoped that applicants will pay attention.</p>
<h3>Soviet Consul General Tiazov Arrives in Shanghai to Protect Soviet Interests, Consulate Will Reopen</h3>
<p>Tiazov, Second Secretary of the Soviet Embassy in Japan and Soviet Consul General in Shanghai, arrived in Shanghai on Wednesday to directly protect Soviet interests here. The Consulate General on Huangpu Road in this city stopped working in 1939, and all the staff except one left Shanghai. Soviet interests were first taken care of by the Norwegian Consulate, and then transferred to the Soviet Embassy in Japan in July 1941 for self-care. However, due to the inconvenience of mailing, the Soviet Consulate in Shanghai decided to reopen to handle matters such as the extension and issuance of passports. It is widely believed that when the Soviet Consulate has completed these affairs, it will suspend operations again temporarily. It is announced that the office hours of the Soviet Consulate are from 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM daily.</p>
<h3>Everyone Pays Close Attention to the Supply of Rice and Coal in the Future</h3>
<p>Municipal Council Clarifies That It Did Not Order Vietnamese Rice</p>
<p>The population of Shanghai has been abnormally dense in recent years. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, maritime transport has been blocked, and the supply of daily necessities is extremely difficult. The authorities have repeatedly expressed the need to evacuate the population. Although many people have left Shanghai to return to their hometowns in recent days, the number is only several hundred thousand, which is not a significant evacuation in proportion to the total population. It is estimated that a large number of people still need to be evacuated from the city, so that the living problems of the citizens who remain in Shanghai in the future can be addressed. Otherwise, even if shipping resumes in the future, ships will not have such a large tonnage to transport rice and coal to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Saying That Vietnamese Rice Was Purchased Is Not True</p>
<p>According to a public announcement by the Information Office of the Municipal Council, the report that this bureau contacted the Japanese authorities to purchase 2 million bags of foreign rice from Vietnam is not true. A clarification is hereby made. Furthermore, it is understood that the Municipal Council issued the following public announcement yesterday in order to eliminate the doubts about the transportation of domestic rice into Shanghai. "After investigation, the control of domestic rice on the Shanghai Extra-Settlement Roads has not been lifted. However, this bureau recently issued a public announcement stating that the transportation of domestic rice within the Public Concession does not require a permit. An urgent announcement is hereby made."</p>
<p>New Method for Numbered Rice Purchase</p>
<p>According to reliable sources last night, in order to relieve the crowds of retail rice buyers in front of the rice shops from wasting time and not being able to purchase foreign rice, the Municipal Council Rice and Grain Management Committee has decided that from the 19th (Monday) onwards, all rice shops selling Municipal Council foreign rice should post the number of bags of Municipal Council foreign rice received that day on the door, and then calculate the average number of people who can be supplied with retail rice based on the number of bags. The patrolmen will then number the crowd in white powder. After a certain number of people are numbered, the rest of the crowd will be informed that there is no more rice to be purchased and instructed to purchase from other rice shops. This will save civilians the wasted time of waiting in line. Once numbered, they will not return empty-handed. It is also understood that the cheap rice in the southwest of Shanghai has been sold out yesterday.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Price Management Office Hosted the Press Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council hosted reporters from various Chinese newspapers in this city yesterday to visit the various offices of the Bureau of Price Management to better understand the work of the Price Management Bureau. The places visited included the rice and flour offices and the Department of Social Welfare, led by Management Committee member Dr. Patterson and Director of the Industrial Section Ms. Xingde.</p>
<h3>The Consular Body Makes a Majority Decision on the Small Rent Prohibition Case</h3>
<p>It is learned that most of the consuls stationed in Shanghai have made a decision on the new regulations proposed by the Municipal Council to prohibit the collection of tips for renting houses. It is generally expected that the consular body will approve the regulations within a few days, giving the Municipal Council an effective new weapon to eliminate the malpractices of collecting small rents when renting houses and to assist the Municipal Council's Mediation Committee in mediating disputes between second landlords and third tenants, thereby stabilizing the entire rental situation in the city.</p>
<h3>Donating Cotton Quilts</h3>
<p>The St. Joseph's Charitable Association, organized by the Catholic community in Hongkou, has been running poverty relief for over 25 years. Amidst the wind and rain of the past years, it has been difficult to maintain, but it is still doing its best to help the poor and needy. This winter, the association raised funds and personally supervised the sewing of hundreds of cotton quilts, allocating 20 of them to be distributed by this newspaper on its behalf. If there are extremely poor families suffering from the cold, they can send a letter to the editorial department of this newspaper to apply, but it must be accompanied by a letter of introduction from a formal business or institution's staff member as proof. This newspaper will send personnel to investigate the facts before issuing a voucher for receiving the cotton quilt. The quota is limited, and those who do not meet the requirements will not be answered.</p>

If the imprisonment is commuted to a fine, it will be calculated at three yuan per day, and if the fine cannot be paid, it will be proportional to six months' imprisonment. The remaining 137 gamblers were each fined 60 yuan. The gambling equipment and gambling money were confiscated as listed.</p>
<h3>Eight-Thousand-Dollar Nickel Block Swindle: Five Culprits Arrested</h3>
<p>A plating factory on Henan Road, Qipan Street, recently experienced a nickel block fraud case involving $80,000 at the end of last month. It is now reported that detectives from the Public Concession police have arrested the main suspect, a Russian named Bao Qitai Fu (26 years old), and Russian accomplices Mantesen (28 years old) and Lujingu (32 years old), along with two Koreans, on the night of the 13th of this month. On the 25th of last month, the Russian Bao Qitai Fu visited the factory to inquire with the factory owner, Mr. Dong, about the availability of nickel blocks for sale. Mr. Dong showed him a sample of the 600 pounds of nickel blocks he had in stock and agreed to sell them for $80,000. Bao agreed and</p>
<p>Paid a Deposit</p>
<p>of 3,900 yuan, agreeing to return the next day to pay the balance and take delivery of the goods. The Russian did not come the following day, so Mr. Dong went to his residence on the 27th to inquire whether he was still interested in purchasing them. Bao indicated that he still wanted to buy them and agreed to take delivery the next day. On the 28th, at 7 PM, two uninvited Korean men arrived at the factory with Bao Qitai Fu in handcuffs. The two Korean men claimed to be government officials who had come to</p>
<p>Confiscate the Nickel Blocks</p>
<p>after arresting the Russian. The factory owner was forced to hand over the goods. The two Korean men hired a rickshaw, loaded the nickel blocks, and escorted both the factory owner and the Russian. Upon reaching the intersection of Henan Road and Nanjing Road, the two Koreans suddenly threatened Mr. Dong, asking whether he wanted the nickel blocks or his life. Mr. Dong said he wanted his life and was released to go home. After returning to the factory, Mr. Dong related the incident to his partners. The partners all</p>
<p>Suspected He Was Swindled</p>
<p>and urged him to report the matter to the police. After receiving the report, the police dispatched officers to investigate. As a result, Bao Qitai Fu was arrested on the evening of the 13th of this month. He confessed that the nickel blocks were entrusted to him by the two Korean men for purchase. He learned that Mr. Dong possessed the nickel blocks through the introductions of the two Russians, Lujingu and Mantesen, and then conspired to defraud him because the two Korean men failed to pay, he claimed. The police then arrested the other two Russians and, in conjunction with the Japanese military police, arrested the two Koreans. The two Koreans have been handed over to the Japanese for interrogation, while the three Russians will be tried in the Special District Court.</p>
<h3>Trolley Service Across the Bridge Resumes on Three Lines</h3>

For some unknown reason, as the road sloped downwards, the rope pulling Wang's rickshaw suddenly broke. Wang himself collided with a utility pole in front of him. At that moment, the rickshaw behind him could not be stopped and crashed into him, violently striking his waist, causing him to spit blood and collapse to the ground immediately. A companion immediately called for assistance, and Wang was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Unfortunately, he died of his injuries before help could arrive on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. The hospital notified the police, who ordered an investigation and transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for an autopsy. After confirming the cause of death, his family arrived to claim the body.</p>
<h3>Couple Commits Suicide by Poison: Unemployment and Financial Hardship Lead Lovers to Die Together in a Hotel</h3>

A woman named Fan Zhifang, 28 years old, of fair appearance, residing at No. 16, Shengping Lane, Gongguan Road, had been passionately in love with Zhang for over a year. Due to parental opposition, a future together seemed impossible. Furthermore, Zhang's recent unemployment added another obstacle to their marriage. The two rented Room 223 at the Dahua Hotel the day before yesterday and committed suicide together by consuming poison. Around 5:00 PM, a waiter discovered the bodies and quickly opened the door. The woman was already dead, but Zhang still showed signs of life. An ambulance was called and both were rushed to Guangci Hospital.

<h3>Jumping From Ground Level to the Tram</h3>
<p>— Wu Bi</p>
<p>With public buses out of service for two days, the tram business is exceptionally brisk. Walking as a substitute for riding is certainly the best way to conquer the "travel" challenge during these extraordinary times. However, on winter mornings, lying in a warm, cozy bed makes one reluctant to get up so abruptly. Therefore, plans to "walk" early in the morning have to be changed, and taking the tram becomes a necessity, inevitably making it "packed to the rafters." Jumping from ground level to the tram is like ascending to heaven in broad daylight, escaping the mundane world and entering a realm of immortals: no need to trudge forward wearing a heavy, twenty-pound wool coat, nor to face the sharp northwest wind that reddens the face and ears—not a result of drinking, but a reaction to the harsh treatment of nature. One can close their eyes, rest their spirit, forget everything, and escape the troubles of rushing. However, such beauty is fleeting, and you must also prepare to accept new inconveniences.</p>
<p>Unlike the spacious platform at a train station, the tram car is impossible to squeeze into, and there's hardly any room to linger on the platform. As a result, smaller individuals often grow two or three inches taller due to the squeezing on the platform—naturally, they lose their foothold. Stretching one's arms to "request" a ticket while rummaging for change in the crowd also has the benefit of lengthening one's limbs!</p>
<p>Finally managing to extract twelve cents from your pocket, you twist around in your overcoat and "greet" the ticket back over someone's head. Before the conductor checks the ticket, you can at least temporarily rest your body and mind.</p>
<p>"Conversations on the tram" cannot compare to "fireside chats," lacking a definite conclusion or order. It's best to listen occasionally and forget occasionally. Yesterday, I had the honor of hearing a great theory from a CPC—not a coffee brand, but the abbreviation for Chinese Police Constable—on the tram platform. The topic: "What posture should one adopt on a crowded tram?" Explanation: "Posture" refers to the attitude and position of the body. He was somewhat distressed to see so many people suffering and even crying out in pain due to the crowding. Therefore, he told everyone, "Don't forget to protect your chest." He then said: The reason people get squeezed to death is mostly due to chest compression, making it impossible to breathe. If you can raise both hands to protect your chest, you can both block external pressure and exert force to resist, preventing heroes from being powerless.</p>
<p>Speaking was strenuous for him because he himself had lost his freedom and was being squeezed to the point of suffocation. When the tram stopped at the next station, I saw him courageously clearing obstacles and rushing to get off. Since we had the same destination, I followed closely behind him and managed to "land safely."</p>
<p>I noticed his right hand was empty, swaying back and forth, looking very lively, while his left hand held a lunchbox.</p>

<h3>Current Self-Improvement</h3>
<p>— Lin Feng</p>
<p>Lately, when meeting with friends, everyone seems very bewildered and listless about everything. Of course, this doesn't mean their will has declined. In reality, it's because they are threatened by their current lives and have temporarily lost their minds.</p>
<p>The most obvious manifestation is in after-work tutoring. Many people stopped after December 8th. Does this mean they no longer need after-work tutoring? No one would think so. Clearly, this attitude is wrong.</p>
<p>In the current environment, how should we pursue after-work self-improvement?</p>
<p>Attending tutoring schools is one way that has led many to success, because what is learned there is more systematic, and the progress is faster with more classmates and discussions. However, this is not the only way, and it has shortcomings in the present situation. For example, many subjects cannot be closely linked to the students' actual needs. Therefore, the second way to pursue after-work self-improvement is self-study.</p>
<p>By self-study, I don't mean studying alone, but rather not attending tutoring schools and having several friends and colleagues of the same occupation or production department study together. The subjects of study can be based on everyone's needs. Factory workers can study the manufacturing process of a certain product; bank clerks should study economics and finance; accounting personnel should improve their accounting knowledge instead of being limited to one area. Other subjects, such as learning a common foreign language, or arithmetic, geography, history, etc., are also needed. During the learning process, there should be confidence and perseverance, with strict mutual supervision. Of course, it would be the icing on the cake if one could also attend tutoring schools if finances and time allowed.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we cannot waste every second. We should fully utilize the current relatively free time to improve our cultural and technical levels.</p>

<h3>Introduction: "The Fellow Townsmen Barbershop"</h3>
<p>— Gu Zhou</p>
<p>Recently, the price of haircuts has increased repeatedly, almost ten times more than before the war. Dealing with one's hair seems to have become a problem for ordinary salaried people. The Shanghai Money Exchange Trade Association at No. 50 Qingyuan Lane, Beijing Road, has organized a "Fellow Townsmen Barbershop" in light of this, employing four barbers who provide services day and night on a numbered seating basis. Recently, they have expanded their services, welcoming non-fellow townsmen to get haircuts. However, the fees are slightly higher. The fee for fellow townsmen is seventy cents, while for non-fellow townsmen it is one dollar, including shampooing, shaving, and blow-drying, and no tips are accepted. However, it is much cheaper than regular barbershops.</p>
<h3>I Exhaust My Heart</h3>
<p>— Liao Shen</p>
<p>The current economic depression in Shanghai is becoming increasingly severe, seemingly without end. Pessimists already have the concept of "Shanghai collapsing." However, regardless of pessimism or not, people must continue to survive. Now, we can only rely entirely on human effort. If we believe that human effort can reverse the situation, why lament in vain? Lamenting only adds to troubles. Finding compassionate solutions amid hardship is the right path. General public opinion is constantly clamoring, not daring to ignore reality, and thinking of ways to seek salvation. Therefore, the authorities, while reluctantly struggling, exert all their efforts in terms of people's food and public security, naturally having a consistent policy that suits the people's hardships and alleviates their suffering. "Stop, I stop; go, I go!" Increasing depression and difficulties are often the case, which is understandable. However, there is concern that human effort will be like a fragile thread, barely hanging on, only going through the motions. Fortunately, the authorities are making persistent efforts, not shirking their responsibilities, and ensuring that the citizens do not lose hope.</p>
<p>The emergency price limit on flour and the transport of national rice without the need for permits are some examples. The Public Concession has even begun to investigate household registrations, with the intention of distributing rations according to population, which is a heavy task. As this is being carried out quickly, it is essential to pay close attention to the potential abuses that may arise!</p>
<p>Naturally, those not listed in the population registers, shivering in the streets and corners, seem to be ignored in terms of coping with life, and it is difficult to count them all at once. At the end of the lunar year, as businesses dissolve and close, the situation is even more alarming. Of course, most of them cannot stay here for long and unfortunately become starving corpses, lying straight on quiet roads, sometimes even having their clothes "borrowed" by "fellow sufferers."</p>
<p>However, those who are forced to linger on the streets are likely to be numerous. Zengzi said, "Be cautious, be cautious." How dare I ignore reality?</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Sixteen. The Fire of Youth</p>
<p>Xiangqi was fully convinced that she had completely uncovered Shaohua's secret, so she did not pursue it further, only giving him a light warning:</p>
<p>"Be careful not to abandon all your other subjects for learning Mandarin!"</p>
<p>Shaohua blushed and did not know how to answer. However, after this lie, his actions became especially free, because in Xiangqi's mind, she always thought that his talk about playing ping pong was a lie, and that falling in love with that classmate's cousin was the truth. Anyway, young people can't avoid having this process, so she no longer bothered about his affairs.</p>
<p>In this way, more than twenty days passed. One night, around ten o'clock, Xiangqi had already returned to her room alone to rest when she suddenly heard a burst of commotion in the lounge on the second floor. Someone was slapping the table and chairs and cursing loudly, someone was crying, and someone was trying to persuade them. It took a full half hour before things quieted down.</p>
<p>The next day, she first noticed that Shaohua's eyes were somewhat red and swollen, and he looked very depressed. On the other hand, Yuhua's face still carried the lingering anger of the previous night.</p>
<p>"Second sister, let me tell you! Shaohua has changed a lot recently!" After breakfast, Jinyu quietly told Xiangqi, "For the past half-month or so, he has been messing around outside every day, never returning home until ten o'clock. We were busy with things and didn't pay attention to him. Until last night, your brother came back a little earlier and happened to run into Shaohua at the door. He was already somewhat unhappy, and then he discovered that the gold ring and gold watch he was wearing were gone, and upon checking his own pocket money, he had spent every last cent. When asked where he had spent it, he stubbornly refused to say, which angered your brother, who beat him up and forbade him from going out at night again."</p>
<p>After hearing this, Xiangqi realized that everything Shaohua had told her last time was simply a lie, because there was no way that getting to know a decent girlfriend at a classmate's house would cost so much money.</p>
<p>"Since that's the case, let me have a good talk with him!" (306)</p>

<h3>Money Supply Slightly Loosens, Government Bonds Rise Again, Foreign Shares Have Supply But No Demand</h3>
<p>The unofficial market for government bonds continues to trend favorably, rising another ten cents to fifty cents. There is an abundance of speculative capital, and the money supply has also loosened. It is reported that those who previously sold bonds, especially the Ningbo gang, are now slightly buying back, so the market price has risen slightly. The strength of the buyers is still considered strong. Those who shorted the market, based on environmental standards, have no choice but to cover their positions, further depleting the market's available bonds. Class C bonds initially opened at 65.10 yuan, but selling pressure caused the price to break through 65 yuan, reaching 64.90 yuan. After a while, buying pressure suddenly increased, pushing the price above 65 yuan, reaching a high of 65.80 yuan, closing at 65.60 yuan. As a result, other bonds rose accordingly. Class A bonds rose from 70.01 yuan to 70.06 yuan, Class B bonds rose from 65.08 yuan to 66.08 yuan, Class D bonds traded at 62.20 yuan, and Class E bonds rose from 63 yuan to 63.40 yuan. Buyers included Hengxing, Tongyi, and Dachang, while sellers included Yiji, Yuxing, Hongda, and Shengda. As a result, bonds continued to rise by ten cents to fifty cents, with relatively little trading volume, approximately 300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the black market for foreign shares outside the General Chamber of Commerce remained weak. There were many sellers, with only Shanghai Water and Electricity at 6 yuan, Tramway at 29 yuan, Xinyi Cotton Mill at 4.60 yuan, Rubber at 11.50 yuan, and Crowell at 1.50 yuan having buyers. Yeguang quoted a buy price of 12.30 yuan to 13 yuan. Langgezhi had a buy price of 12.20 yuan, while the seller asked 13.90 yuan. Other shares, such as Shanghai Bank Company at 10.02 yuan, Zhongying at 11 yuan, Yangzi at 11 yuan, Asia Navigation at 8.50 yuan, Paper at 4.50 yuan, British Union at 18 yuan, Jardine Matheson at 57 yuan, Telephone at 22 yuan, Jardine Spinning Mill at 23 yuan, Shanghai Wool at 5 yuan, KenZhi at 18.60 yuan, Xiangtai Timber at 27.75 yuan, China Textile at 9 yuan, Carolin at 1 yuan, Steel at 18.50 yuan, and Consolidation at 2.20 yuan, all had sellers but no buyers. Jardine Brewery had a quoted buy/sell price of 5 yuan and 5.50 yuan, while the rest had no price reported.</p>
<h3>Speculation Fluctuates, Exchange Drafts and Cash Reach Parity</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash speculation market turned into a turbulent state, initially rising, then falling, and then rising again. Although there were reports of Tianjin gold prices falling slightly to 11,600 yuan and inquiries about mortgage loans, the large number of limit-price buyers caused the 11,000 yuan mark to retreat and then rebound. People's sentiment was uncertain. In the morning, Xin Yuan sold ten taels (375 grams) to a certain gold shop at a price of 11,350 yuan, an increase of 80 yuan. The gold shop then sold ten taels to a customer at 11,400 yuan. Due to reports of Tianjin gold prices falling slightly, people's sentiment softened, and two gold shops and Decheng, etc., sold off, causing the price to drop by 500 yuan, reaching a low of 10,900 yuan. Wanfeng, Shunyuan, Gonghe, Tong Kangyong, and the silver shop gang saw the low price one after another or bought in at a limit price, so the price rebounded by 250 yuan, reaching 11,150 yuan. At noon, a certain gold shop sold off again, causing the price to fall again. At noon, the price was 11,080 yuan, which was 190 yuan lower than the closing price of the previous day. The price difference on the day was 500 yuan, and a total of 800 to 900 taels were traded. Silver shops continued to quote 1,200 yuan per tael for gold ornaments (receiving price reduced by 200 yuan), and 16 yuan per tael for silver. The black market had fallen to 11 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign currency market weakened again. The British pound and the US gold pound each fell by 5 yuan, the former to 260 yuan and the latter to 265 yuan. US dollar checks retreated to 16.50 yuan and 16.55 yuan. Hong Kong checks rose to 2.67 yuan, and military notes also rose to 3.935 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange drafts and notes was reduced by 3 yuan per thousand, reaching parity, because carrying cash is not as safe as using drafts. The interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association remained unchanged at six cents.</p>
<h3>The End of the Settlement Period Approaches; Difficult for the Yarn Market to Revitalize</h3>
<p>The yarn market entered a fluctuating state yesterday. Transactions were not as brisk as in the past. This is because the end of the settlement period is approaching, and new transactions have been reduced. At the same time, spot transactions are weaker, so people's hearts are slightly weary. The momentum of the No. 2 Central Branch's Shuangma Factory Singles in the morning was slightly weaker, falling by thirty yuan to one thousand seven hundred yuan, with twenty bales traded. Once this price opened, buyers in the market flocked in, and the situation rose upward, fluctuating between one thousand seven hundred thirty and forty yuan for quite a while, once reaching one thousand seven hundred seventy-five yuan. Later, it was heard that spot yarn transactions were not smooth, and the price suddenly fell by three or four yuan, and the situation was frustrated again, loosening to one thousand seven hundred forty yuan. At the close, it rebounded to one thousand seven hundred sixty yuan. 42-count Blue Phoenix was four thousand yuan, 42-count Bao Guang was four thousand yuan, 42-count Wuzi was four thousand yuan, 60-count Riguang was seven thousand nine hundred fifty yuan, 40-count Riguang was three thousand five hundred fifty yuan, 20-count Yueqin was two thousand one hundred eighty yuan, 20-count Xianhe was two thousand one hundred ninety-five yuan, 20-count Fengnian was two thousand six hundred forty yuan, 18-count Zhinv was one thousand eight hundred eighty yuan, 16-count Hongkui Xing was one thousand seven hundred thirty yuan, 20-count Tiannv was two thousand four hundred fifty yuan (without tax invoice), two thousand four hundred ninety yuan (with tax invoice), and 10-count Tongzijun was one thousand three hundred ninety yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Speculation Changes to New Tricks Again</h3>
<p>Before the Pacific War, cotton yarn speculation and trading developed abnormally. Men, women, old and young, flocked to it. There were old and young women, and energetic young male students. At that time, the so-called yarn firms and silver firms sprang up like mushrooms after a rain, and the scene was extraordinarily lively. The only magic weapon to attract customers was the unit of cotton yarn trading, "starting with one bale" (not entirely so). The margin was initially one hundred yuan, and later, due to the violent ups and downs in the market, it was doubled (two hundred yuan, with 1% interest given if not withdrawn for six months). On the Saturday before the incident, the margin was increased to three hundred yuan per piece. When the incident occurred, speculative trading stopped, and customers hesitated to move forward. If this continued, the employees of the silver firms and yarn firms would inevitably "sit and wait for death." Otherwise, they had to think of some new tricks to attract gamblers and speculators. Sure enough, a new trick has come: the cotton yarn unit, starting with five bales. Regardless of long or short positions, the margin only requires three hundred yuan in total (if so, the margin for each bale of yarn only requires sixty yuan, is this not a reflection of the recession?). However, for those going long, the silver firm advances the mortgage payment with interest starting at 2%, and the commission is one yuan for each entry and exit (per piece). For those going short, the silver firm is willing to pay the customer monthly interest of 1% (isn't this taking from the bulls to patch up the sores of the bears?). The commission is 80 cents for each entry and exit (per piece). Why treat short clients so favorably and long clients so poorly? There is a reason for this. If you are generous to long clients and stingy to short clients, how will you cope when you need spot goods? In order to avoid trouble and ensure stable profits, it is better to do the opposite. The intermediary (broker) will be able to sit back and enjoy huge profits without worry. With this call, customers will definitely rush to go short. When the firm sees a low price, they will definitely go long like crazy. If the shorts see the situation and reluctantly make up for their losses, then the intermediary's profit will be extremely high. This "new change in cotton yarn trading" is something that old-timers in speculative trading dare not "try lightly." However, like "newborn calves are not afraid of tigers," general laymen think that going short has particularly good profits, how do they know they are not jumping into a "bottomless pit"? (Long)</p>
<h3>Fine Cloth Sales in Ningbo Active</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday, people's hearts turned better, and the market atmosphere continued to rise. 16-pound Butterfly coarse cloth was sold at 115.5 yuan, Double Elephant at 110 yuan, 14-pound One Deer at 92.5 yuan, 11-pound Three Rabbits at 79 yuan, 9-pound Five Blessings at 68.5 yuan, 13-pound Flying Bear at 86 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong at 55.5 yuan. 12-pound Dapeng fine cloth, due to the Ningbo gang's orders, is extremely scarce in stock, opening at 93.5 yuan, and rising another 1.5 yuan per piece. The after-market is rising with the eastern pieces, and each cloth is shouting 50 cents to 1 yuan higher per piece. This street purchased 300-odd packages of coarse and fine cloth and colored cloth.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Yesterday, with the Yantai gang and this street making moves, the fine cloth market showed a turning point, and prices all rebounded. Leading fine cloth factory Singles opened at 86 yuan, rose to 87 yuan at closing, and once rose to 87.5 yuan in the after-market, but still remained at 87 yuan when the herd arrived, a rise of 1.5 yuan per piece compared to the previous day. Flying Fish was 85.5 yuan, Colorful Ball was 84.75 yuan, Yang He was 84.5 yuan, and Trumpet was 84 yuan, all of which were traded. The market situation is quite tight. Four Gentlemen Serge new singles were initially weak but rose later, closing at 3.078 yuan, also a rise of 3 cents per yard.</p>
<h3>Decreased Arrivals from the Four Rural Areas; Price of Thin Rice Rebounds</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the weather suddenly turned cold, and the amount of rice arriving from the four rural areas also decreased. Apart from direct self-management and allocation to customers and peddlers along the way, only 130-odd packages of new arrivals were sampled in the market, especially with fewer arrivals of early thin rice from the southern route. Therefore, the selling price of early thin rice has been raised by two or three yuan. Thin rice is from 194.5 yuan to 197 yuan, early rice is 196 yuan. The digestion of this japonica rice is flat, still in a stable situation, high at 224 yuan, big market at 216 yuan. The actual digestion of Yuan rice has slightly increased, and arrivals have continued. Yin Yuan is still opening at 194.5 yuan, but Bian Yuan has not had new arrivals for a long time. After opening above 220 yuan and 215.6 yuan, there has been no sale since. Yesterday, the Changzhou Bian Yuan that opened was also brought down by Yin Yuan, only opening at 200 yuan. It is said that the total transaction volume in the market for the whole day was 170-80 packages.</p>
<h3>Unsmooth Supply of Miscellaneous Grains</h3>
<p>The supply of miscellaneous grains has not been smooth, and it is still difficult to extract from warehouse stocks, resulting in a daily decrease in supply, while actual sales are not declining, so market prices are rising again and again.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Office, which centrally controls edible oil in this city, held a meeting yesterday to formally establish itself, and elected 24 supervisors and directors, publicly electing Yang Heqing and He Quansheng as chairman and vice-chairman of the board respectively. In addition to already purchasing bulk soybean oil from Qingdao, the office is also making every effort to search for existing stocks in the city, resulting in a shortage of supply in the market, and market conditions continue to rise. Yesterday, 100 dan of Qing oil from Dayou Factory were sold, with the price reaching 297 yuan, an increase of 7 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<p>Soybean cake is rising due to the high price of soybeans, and the liquidation in the villages is continuing, so cargo owners are very eager to sell. Yesterday, 1,000 pieces of Shenji soybean cake July warehouse receipts for overnight goods were sold, with the price reaching 21 yuan. Fresh goods of Feizi cake were being shouted for sale at 25-26 yuan.</p>
<p>Corn flour was seen for the first time yesterday for sale in the market. It is good that this poor people's food has gradually become universalized due to the driving force of the environment. It is estimated that 10 packages were handled by the flour shops on this street, with the price being 68 yuan per market dan.</p>
<p>The arrival of soybeans is lacking and stocks are dry. Cargo owners continue to be very bullish. Yesterday, ten packages of Tianjin Xin Jinyuan were additionally purchased by stores on this street, with the price reaching a high of 119 yuan. Another 20 packages of green beans were priced at 110.05 yuan, 5 packages of Pinghu Doudou were priced at 123 yuan. Broad beans are also trending upward due to scarce goods. 30 packages of Pinghu Jianqing were transacted, with the price reaching 96.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Amid the difficulties of people's livelihoods, the sales of corn are becoming more and more prosperous. Yesterday morning, the market conditions were raised by two or three yuan. Later, because part of the warehouse stock could be extracted, it fell by half a yuan to one yuan. As a result, it still rose by one or two yuan compared to the previous day. It is estimated that 200 packages of Wuhu corn were sold, with the price being 56.7 to 57 yuan. 100 packages of Huangdu corn were priced at 57.2 yuan, more than 200 packages of He Lan yellow corn were priced at 51.5 to 53.5 yuan, and 400 packages of white corn were priced at 53 to 51.5 yuan. 200 packages of Saigon old corn were priced at 51.5 to 52 yuan, and 300 packages of new corn were priced at 58 to 58.5 yuan in the west warehouse, 57 yuan in the east warehouse. Another 100 tons from Yinghua Company were priced at 89 to 86 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Prices Rise Endlessly</h3>
<p>Cigarettes: Because the goods in the warehouse are unlikely to be unsealed, and the factory still has no news of dispatching goods, the market goods are becoming more and more dry. Those who hold the goods are especially bullish, so the price is rising endlessly. It is estimated that Great Britain brand has risen to 5,800 yuan per case, a huge surge of 700 yuan compared to the previous period. Other prices are also trending upwards very strongly, such as Laodao Pi at 4,800 yuan, Pinhai brand at 4,700 yuan, Wuhua brand at 3,700 yuan, Xiaoxiannv brand at 3,700 yuan, Jinshu brand medium case at 1,670 yuan, and Meili brand at 2,600 yuan.</p>
<p>Soap: The market atmosphere is still stable, and retail vendors are more active. Because there is a lot of stock, the price is difficult to be good. It is estimated that Baixiang Mao soap is traded at 80 yuan, Gumu soap at 85 yuan, and Huangxiang Mao soap at 65 yuan, all without honor or disgrace. The fire match trend has turned brisk and sharp, Phoenix brand is 1,695 yuan per case, Sailing Candle is 65 yuan.</p>
