<p>關於阿拉斯加的風景，也形，人口，出產，等等都介紹了一個大略，現在要提出一個問題來說說。譬如像阿拉斯加這樣的地帶，在軍事上總算有些價值，為什麼美國直到此日此時，才想起了要建築公路？築了公路，又有何用？</p>
<p>要想把這個問題明白解釋，却也不是一件簡單的工作。前在「土爾其護城河中，請讀者看過一齣啞戲，本文劈頭就說育空河的浪漫，這理且搜集些小說材料，供讀者咀嚼一會。</p>
<p>先從人說起：人人都有一種特殊的調調兒，這種特殊調調兒，照小說分析上說，就是個性。譬如英人的紳士調調，非人的呆烏調調，印人阿三調調，都是一種個性。美人則有美人的個性。美人的個性，說他是圓滑，有時又好像是個　大：說他活潑，有時又很固執；說他是個生意人，喜歡掂斤播兩，然而有時却慷慨得很：有時被人吃飛一，他使馴得像孫子一樣：然而到了相當的時機，他又兇得像一隻猘犬。初見面的時候他總是一副獸女婿的樣子，你怎樣的要着他玩，他都可以承受；你要說他眞　真傻，那你才是一個劃一不二的傻瓜哩，因為他心下什麼都明白，不過他是裝伴賣傻罷了。</p>
<p>然而美人究竟是個什麼個性呢？這却有些說不出。只能說他喜歡做　大亨；雖說喜歡說幾句大話，但有時他也真　弄　玩意給你瞧瞧。他們也喜歡花樣翻新，又喜歡大計劃，大規模的幹事。前次歐戰把這些個性都表現過一番。這一回當然也想如此來一下，可是時與地的情形，都與當日不大相同，所以至今猶不曾登台露過一回。前兩天似乎有些動的「消息」，神經過敏的人都彼此傳說，以為這姍姍遲來的美人，已經出塲了。這是望之過切，而不覺期之過早了。她確實還在「化裝一，化裝未畢，安肯登塲？至於有那麼一點消息的話，那是「過路客一點小小的「噱頭」，開開玩笑罷了。</p>
<p>如此說來，美人究竟在幹些什麼？幾個月前提起過的阿拉斯加公路，怎麼消息杳然？「只聽樓梯饗，不見人下來；」到底是怎麼　回事？</p>

<p>馬達加斯加島於一九二七年曾　經過一次巨大的經濟危機，當時社會情形凄凉，民生凋敝，惟經年來執政者之說意致進，該島元氣巳趨恢復現在當一個遠方的旅行者由迢遙的火車旅途帶到塔那那里時，他會對眼前所出現的一切表示驚異不止，這裹有着整潔寬闊的柏油路，那兩旁高聳蒼鬱的椰子樹被熱帶的季候風拂着輕輕搖動，在那靜寂的街上，他會看見一羣穿着鮮艷的衣裙的土人女子　笑着從他身旁穿過，他們有着鯬黑的面孔，自然你不能拿她們來與一個在巴黎生長的嬌生慣養的女人相比擬，但如其你用另一種審美的眼光來看，你會發覺她們有着另一種純僕之美，她們在節日裏，踏着輕快的舞步，歌唱着，嬉笑着，你也許正是從那些繁需的都市裹來，你成天被喧雜的空氣壓迫着有空息般的痛苦，那末塔那那里－這熱帶性靜美麗的都市會帶與你另一種新鮮一種活力。</p>
<p>馬達加斯加是個以農為本之島，由於氣候適宜：土壤肥沃，每年的出產着實　人，其中尤以東部近莫三鼻給海峽平原一帶土質最為優良，農民大都於雨季開始時耕種，至乾燥季終了後再行收穫，經此種培養之植物，大都有着極佳之收成。這一帶的主要農產，有米，甘蔗；棉花等，每年出產之總數，一半均輸出至歐洲大陸</p>
<p>中部高原一帶，因地勢較高（平均在水平綫一公呎以上）故適宜種麥，與中歐情形相仿。這一帶並是繁茂之水菓培植區，年來由法國移來的菓種，經試騐之結果，如蘋菓，梨樹，葡萄，杏樹等，均有完美之出產、至于島之北部，因氣候炎熱，於雨季時，最適宜栽植咖啡：丁香及其他香料植物。</p>
<p>提到米，這是島民最主要之食物，全島各個均佈滿綠葱的稻田，特別是Morovav一帶更是魚米富庶之鄉。在過去，馬達加斯加島一度會鬧過嚴重的米荒，每年須由亞洲輸入厭大的數量，而且當時由於農業技術之　劣，米質亦參差不齊，惟自經專門農業人材之選種與開墾，馬達加斯加島的食米，不但可以自給而且一躍為世界主要產米區域，米質經不斷實騐之結果，已可與馬來等地之出品相媲美。</p>
<p>作為島民之副食品，尚有滿尼亞克（Manioc一種大戟科植物）豆類，出芋等。至於玉蜀黍，在以前產量極微，後因鄰近各島需求甚殷，而此種食物之栽植，乃引起島上農民之注意。</p>
<p>與農業有密切關係的牧畜業，在島民的生活上，亦佔據重要的位置，在鄉村中我們幾乎可以看見所有佃戶的飼養豬牛等牲畜，Betsiles及Vohemar一帶廣大的草原，是最理想之牧畜塲所。西部之島民把牲畜視為他們最主要之財產，在馬達加斯加最普通飼養的有駝牛，這是一種笨重慵懶的畜類，有着巨大的身軀，如飼養得法，體重往往可超過八九百公斤。</p>
<p>世人都知道馬達加斯加島是個礦產富庶的地區，他們也許會首先提到這裹的金礦，不錯在過去，掘金幾乎成為島民所最從事之主要職業。但金礦的蘊藏也並不是永不完盡的，根據統計，在一九一二年時之產量為一九九六公斤，可是隨着長時期之開發，目前產量尚不足一百公斤，三十年間，產、量銳减小廿倍。</p>
<p>實際作為島上最主要之礦產，乃是石墨，這是廿世紀電學昌明所最不可缺少之原料，全世界各地除錫蘭有大量的出產外，其次即屬馬達加斯加島。此礦大都集中於塔那那里一帶，每年的產量約有三萬噸。</p>
<p>馬達加斯加並是個擁有鎳礦蘊藏富庶的地方，按镍礦係戰爭期問最急需之原料，根據勘察者之報告，馬達加斯加之Vaiazoro區域估計每年可提取純　達四十萬噸，這是一筆多麽豐富的資源。</p>
<p>除以上敘述者，馬達加斯加島尚出產鐵，煤，石油並少許之放射素物質，惟較為次要，故略而不論。</p>

<h3 id="c51">紀念父母節 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— 益</p>
<p>今天是中國第二屆父母節的節日，一般有父母的子女，和做父母的人，逢此佳節，不免有種種感想。　以以數琮講，世界上至少有一半的人是男女兒童，那末在這個一年一度的節日，做子女的要尊敬父母，身為父母的要負起做父母的責任，所以父母節實在也可說是全人類的節日，沒有父母，我們無從產生，無從長大，我們若不生育子女，敎養子婦，民族無從繁殖，無從健全。</p>
<p>發揚孝親美德</p>
<p>先從發揚孝親美德來講，我們的身體　　，無不受之父母，生我者父母，育我者父母，每當一個季節的轉變，就免不了要我們的父母，操一番心思，不必去數說一日三餐等每天的種種勞心的愛護。所以我國人是向來主張孝親的。而同時我國歷史上也不乏敎子成名的名母，和孟母的三擇鄰處，對於現代科學化的育兒原理。也是符合的。歐母的晝荻敎字，表顯着堅苦卓絕的精神。岳母的臨別刺字，宣示着忠孝大義。這些都佔着歷史上光榮的一頁，足為後世父母的表率。此外更有許多名貴的家書，可以證明父敎的可貴，在現代人物中間，也不難歷舉幾個例子，胡適之先生在他的「四十自述」一書裹面，曾說起他如何得力於母敎。趙晋卿先生，會把喬松茂蔭慈竹春暉　張圖書，付印微文，去紀念他的父母。徐悲鴻先生曾有　張圖畫，晝着他的母親在敎育子女的神情。這些都是我們所看到的，此外更有許多父母，尤其是母親的，不辭辛勞，甚至於憑着她們十固指尖工作所得的些徵金錢，去為她們的子女籌劃敎育費用，這是多末偉大而值得歌頌的事，所以在這個父母節，我們應該檢討我們的父母的賜與而設法報答。</p>
<p>推行父母敎育</p>
<p>然而對上一代的父母盡我們的孝道，還只是盡了我們責任的一半，如果我們巳經身為父母，那末我們就應當自我修養，而盡力敎育我們的子女。因為子女的產生，是每一對沒有嚴重疾病的夫婦可以辦到的，我們必須生而能育，養而能敎，方能克盡我們做父母的責任，華盛盾的父親，能彀鼓勵誠實（假使換了另一個父親，也許在聽到華盛頓誠實的故事以後要痛責他一頓了），羅斯福的母親努力敎養他的兒子，希望他做一個正直的公民，安迪生的母親，能彀了解她兒子的一切，終於造成了一個大發明家，而簫伯納的母親是一個音樂天才，她對於音樂的愛好，給予蕭伯納以極大的影響。</p>
<p>的確，家庭敎育，比學校敎育，更為重要，我們決不能把子女送進了學校以後，就算盡了做父母的責任，必須在家庭裹極力去培植我們的子女，去養成他們優美的品性，良好的習慣，和高尙的人格。</p>
<p>救濟困苦父母</p>
<p>此外，在這個父母節，還有一種有意義的工作，就是增進父母的福利，除了尊敬我們自己的父母之外，對於別人的父母，也應該加以尊敬，遇有困苦的父母，應該設法救濟，這旣是老我老以及人之老，也可以說是人類互助精神的表顯。</p>
<p>父母節是很容易過去的，但如果我們能根據上述三點，努力做去，那末今後將有更賢明的父母，更有為的子女，更健全的家庭和更進步的社會了。</p>
<h3 id="c52">我的母親（微文揭曉之一） <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— 瑜</p>
<p>這裹所叙述的一個母親，可說是一個舊禮敎束縛中出來的鬭士，她能彀勇敢地把她的女兒送進學校，這一種精神的確是值得我們敬佩的。－編者</p>
<p>祖母幾天不要媽替她梳頭了，媽叫她也不答應n原因是為了媽不曾遵從她的話，媽放我到縣中去寄讀。於是見了來閒玩的客人們總是吁氣說：「人老珠黃不值錢，我老了，速說話都背時了。「女子無才便是德」，這是歷代遺留下的古訓。十二三歲的女孩子，不在家裹學針綫，反而放到陌生的學校裏讀書，眞是家門不幸。」</p>
<p>為了這事，爸也有些怪媽，常說：「你太縱容孩子了。」</p>
<p>祖母的嘲諷，爸的責怪，可是媽呢，除了背地裹流淚外，就沒有更好的發洩方法。她常在沒人處對我說：「瑜，你一定要爭氣，別等媽將來再受人訕笑。」我却只有點着頭，流下晶瑩的淚珠。</p>
<p>日子彈指的過去，轉眼已到開學。出門的前一日，媽為我整理行李。她那變行走費力的小脚，來回不停走着，一件淺籃色的夏布衫，給汗水黏濕了半背。我幾次叫她休息一回，讓我自己動手。她只是說：「天熱，讓我來，你弄得不妥當。」她直忙到傍晚，方才收拾停當。</p>
<p>晚上，爸把我叫到跟前，給了我五十塊錢，說是膳食，學費，書籍一總在內。我用顫抖着的手接了。我不能嫌少，也不容嫌少。這數目還是媽費了大力，為我爭執來的。</p>
<p>次日天才破曉，媽悄悄的叫醒我，遞給我二十個滾熱的銀元，說是她多時的私蓄，給我添着零用。我接了錢，眼淚又浸濕了眼睛。我握着的彷彿不是錢，是媽的一顆熾熱的心！</p>
<p>以後幾經波折，由於媽的幫助，和自巳堅決的掙扎，終於讓我成功了一個為當今社會所輕視的小學敎師，我不曾有一日能為媽吐氣揚眉。去冬歸去，依然行裝單薄，一雙空手。媽雖然還是同　的愛我。可是看到媽齒脫髮花，漸入老境，我的心不覺隱隱作痛，我用什麽來報答媽過去對我的期望呢！</p>

<p>— 華</p>
<p>這裏所說的百萬富翁，並不是具有百萬家產的富翁，而正是我們的子女啊！因為我們的子女，有着幾百萬分鐘的時間可以供他們應用，時問旣然是世界上無價之寳，那末他們具有這幾百萬分鐘的時間，不就是世界上最幸運，最富有的人嗎。以一個十歲的孩子而論，他可以活到七十歲，他就有三千萬分鐘的時間，其中三分之一是睡眠時間，三分之　是為着生活而忙碌的時間，他仍舊有三分之一的時間，可以從事修養。</p>
<p>關於母敎的價值，在秦同培譯的品性論一書裹，曾有下列一段：</p>
<p>一得良母一，可敵學校敎師百，家庭間之良母，猶心中之磁石，目中之北斗星，　其所而衆兒環向之，神志皆為所吸聚。</p>
<p>庫列氏嘗舉兒童初期概念之影響仿之嫩樹皮所刻之文字，樹皮上之文字隨樹長大，兒童初期之印象亦然，始印象時，極為微細，然以漸成長，雖至終身，亦決難消滅一。</p>
<p>所以我們切不要忘記我們家裏的富翁，在幼年時候能　給予他們優良的敎育，當他們成人之後，就可以享用他們寶貴的財富了。</p>

<p>— 孝君</p>
<p>——母愛原是最偉</p>
<p>大的，從這一篇文字裹面，我們更可以看到一個可愛的慈母——編者</p>
<p>我在六歲的時候，開始讀書，讀的時枯燥無味的「三字經」。那愚魯的我總是急得大哭而背不出來。看到姊姊哥哥都讀得很好，於是自己又感到非常慚愧。於是母親溫和地安慰我，一面命姊姊敎我讀，我也隨口的應着。不多幾遍已像老婆婆念經似的能够背了。在當時幼稚的心靈中，便存留了一個母親是幫助我過難關的人，感到母親的可愛。</p>
<p>不幸在十歲的一年，大姊和哥哥相機去世。那時我也正患着危險的傷寒症。母親旣受了嚴重的打擊，又有了重大的心事，便整日整夜的守在我的床邊，常常五六天不睡覺。遇到我在睡夢中叫了一聲，她立刻就說道：「孩子，你感到怎麼樣？」有一次夜裹，母親叫關我道：「孩子！吃藥了！」當時我覺到母親已有有好幾天不睡了，便晚道：「媽！你也睡一會吧！」媽說道：「我巳經睡過剛起來。」我回頭看見媽的被褥放得很整齊的知道沒睡過。從此我明白母親是最愛護我身體的一個人。</p>
<p>到十三歲的春天，我攷進了初中一下（這是第一次入學校）母親叮囑我對師長同學應持的態度。因為我一向不曾進過學校的緣故，不知攷試是什麼。到學期結束竟有三課不及格，需補攷升級。我哭了。母親呢？反而安慰我道：「孩子！沒關係。道是因為你不知道學校的規矩。」</p>
<p>有一次母親對我說：「孩子！我祇你一個兒子，應為我爭一口氣。叫人家說不是，說我溺愛你呢！我聽了以為母親要我讀　用功，便捧着盡死讀。不知怎的竟在這一年得了氣喘症，時發時愈，至今不得好。母親念得日夜不安。因之她自己的身子也日益衰弱頭髮也漸漸的白了。當遇發作時總是通宵不眠。雖然一切費用母親都是非常節儉的，但醫藥費的鉅大支出，她是亳不顧慮的。</p>
<p>我們的學校規定凡高中三第一名畢業的可以領升大學的獎學金。當時我也有得獎金的希望。可是不幸竞得憫第二名。當我捧了畢業證書及獎狀送到母親手裹的時候，母親說：「孩子！你沒暗昧的舉動（指作弊）吧！」我正色道：「媽！我決不肯為虛榮而辱沒你。」這時我看見媽第一次眞正的笑了。還道：「可恥的第一名，不如光榮的末名。」後來更指敎我去玫那個大學。從此我知道媽不但愛護我的身體，並且更愛護我的人格。</p>
<p>母親的愛，是高潔不可言喻的。</p>

Events related to Australia's survival will occur in the coming weeks, and we must prepare accordingly, especially as the threat of attack could materialize at any time. Today, the Pacific War has reached a grave stage, and significant events are imminent. I have frankly declared in both Houses of Parliament in the past that without sufficient naval and air power, initiating an offensive from Australia would be futile. Assuming we cannot hold Australia, launching an offensive is out of the question. In short, our wartime economy must be developed to the maximum extent. Our country is currently in a race against time, and many difficulties remain that we must find ways to resolve."</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 9th, Haitong News Agency: According to news from Canberra, the excitement of the Australian people caused by the initial American reports of the Battle of the Coral Sea has gradually decreased due to the second speech given by Australian Prime Minister Curtin yesterday.

He refused to issue statements regarding the outcome of the battle, only saying that the results of this battle will be sufficient to enable the Japanese military to determine future war strategies for Australia. The Australian Prime Minister also gave a broadcast address to the nation on radio, and his words were especially frank. He said that Australia is now in its most dangerous period, and that the outbreak of war in the coming weeks is sufficient to shake the world, and that the invasion of Australia could materialize at any time.</p>

He said, "The soldiers of the Allied nations must be filled with courage, as 1942 will be a particularly serious year of crisis. Hitler will launch a final all-out offensive this year. At that time, Germany and Japan are very likely to act in concert. Japan may attack Alaska and our northwest coast, and German planes may transport personnel to Latin America to incite revolts by Germans. In short, we must be vigilant against the intensified activities of the 'Fifth Column' in South America."</p>
<p>Lisbon, 9th, Haitong News Agency: U.S. Vice President Wallace gave a broadcast address to the American people yesterday, predicting that the Axis powers will launch a joint offensive this summer.

<h3 id="e20">The Alaska Highway (2) <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>The scenery, landforms, population, and products of Alaska, etc., have all been given a rough introduction. Now, let's raise a question. Why did the United States only think of building a highway in Alaska now, when it has some military value? And what's the use of building a highway?</p>
<p>Explaining this question clearly is not a simple task. Previously, in "Turkey's Moat," the reader was asked to watch a pantomime. This article begins by talking about the romance of the Yukon River, and now it will collect some fictional material for the reader to chew on for a while.</p>
<p>Let's start with people: Everyone has a special characteristic. This special characteristic, according to novel analysis, is personality. For example, the British gentleman's characteristic, the African black man's dull characteristic, and the Indian's characteristic are all personalities. Americans also have their own personality. The American personality is sometimes said to be slick, but sometimes it seems like a big idiot; sometimes it's said to be lively, but sometimes it's very stubborn; sometimes it's said to be a businessman who likes to haggle, but sometimes it's very generous; sometimes they are taken advantage of, and they are as obedient as grandchildren; but when the time is right, they are as fierce as rabid dogs. When you first meet them, they always act like harmless fools, and they can take whatever you throw at them; if you think they are really stupid, then you are the real fool, because they understand everything in their hearts, but they are just pretending to be fools.</p>
<p>But what exactly is the American personality? It's hard to say. We can only say that they like to be big tycoons; although they like to say a few boastful words, sometimes they really show you some tricks. They also like novelty and like big plans, doing things on a large scale. The previous European war showed all of these personalities. Of course, they also want to do something like that this time, but the circumstances of time and place are not the same as they were then, so they have not yet made an appearance. A few days ago, there seemed to be some "news," and nervous people were spreading rumors to each other, thinking that this late-arriving American had already appeared. This is because they wanted it too much, and they didn't realize it was too early. She is still "putting on makeup," and she won't come on stage until she's finished. As for that little bit of news, it's just a small "gimmick" for passers-by to joke around with.</p>
<p>So, what exactly are the Americans doing? What happened to the Alaska Highway that was mentioned a few months ago? "Only the sound of footsteps on the stairs, but no one coming down;" what's going on?</p>
<p>We can't treat Americans as Cheng Yaojin, who doesn't care about anything and just starts with three axe blows. They will never be so reckless. Although they look so silly, they are very calm when it comes to national affairs. Their process is a trilogy - one, two, three.</p>
<p>If we were to give each part of this trilogy a name, we could say that the first part is from Panama to Alaska, the second part is from collecting scrap aluminum to flying fortresses, and the third part is 1943.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Fighting Still Ongoing on Madagascar; British Foreign Office Announces Five Proposals; Rumors Say Island Will Be Transformed into a Base <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Vichy, 8th, Havas News Agency: At 5 PM today, official telegrams received here from Madagascar stated that the resistance on the island is still ongoing. As for the garrison at Diego Suarez port in the north of the island, they are currently in negotiations with the British military. The conditions are still unknown here. At present, fierce fighting is still taking place in the mountainous areas south of the port. In short, the cessation of resistance in the Diego Suarez and Antsiranana regions does not mean that the entire island has unconditionally surrendered or accepted the ultimatum presented by the British military upon their entry into the scene. The Governor of Madagascar, Annet, had announced his determination to resist any landing attempt by the British military. The issue of the island cannot be considered resolved simply because of the fall of Diego Suarez port. At the same time, news from the island is awaited with great anticipation here. Government leaders are in constant contact with Colonial Minister Pléven.</p>
<p>London, 8th, Havas News Agency: Regarding the French Madagascar incident, the Foreign Office released a communiqué stating, "When our forces first landed in Courrier Bay, and had not yet encountered active resistance from French forces, our commanding officer was instructed by the government to present the following proposals to the French authorities on the island, requesting them to cooperate with us and avoid unnecessary warfare: The sovereignty of Madagascar still belongs to France, and will be returned to France as soon as the war ends. All military and government officials who express their willingness to cooperate with the Allied nations will continue to receive their salaries and pensions as usual. On the other hand, those who refuse to cooperate with us will be sent back to their home country once transportation is restored. The Allied nations will restore trade with the island and provide economic convenience, just like other French territories willing to cooperate with the Allied nations. The only condition for implementing the above measures is that all military and ordinary equipment must not be damaged in any way, and must be operated by French personnel as usual."</p>
<p>British Forces Take Over Military Port Facilities</p>
<p>London, 9th, Havas News Agency</p>
<p>According to press reports, the British forces landing on Madagascar began taking over various facilities at the Diego Suarez military port in the north of the island yesterday before noon, led by light tanks and armored vehicles.</p>
<p>Vichy, 9th, Havas News Agency: French Air Force Captain Assolant, known for participating in trans-Atlantic flights, fought against British planes in the skies over Madagascar this time and has not returned since. It is likely that he has been killed in action.</p>
<p>Vichy, 9th, Havas News Agency: There are various rumors about the terms of the armistice at Diego Suarez port in Madagascar. Well-informed sources here are still unaware of them, but say that the surrender of the port is purely military in nature and has no political significance.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 9th, Haitong News Agency: According to news from London, the work of transforming Madagascar into an Allied base will soon begin. Military reserves and war materials are already waiting in several seaports in Africa. London has publicly acknowledged that the administration of the island will be taken over by Tegorpe, so that administration will not be interrupted and the Allied military operations will not be hampered. British newspapers are competing to publish articles from New York newspapers advocating that the U.S. military should occupy Martinique, Guadeloupe and other French colonies. Washington officials are still silent on this matter and seem unwilling to openly break off relations with Vichy.</p>
<p>U.S.-French Relations Show Slight Improvement</p>
<p>Washington, 8th, Havas News Agency: The Navy Department announced that the U.S. military did not participate in the fighting near Diego Suarez port or elsewhere on Madagascar. The rumors circulating in London that the U.S. military had arrived on the island are untrue. We would like to solemnly declare that there are no U.S. troops on the island at present.</p>
<p>Vichy, 8th, Havas News Agency: After the United States denied direct participation in the attack on Diego Suarez port, the slight improvement in relations between the U.S. and France has been clearly proven by this denial. According to political figures here, the reason why the United States insists on this position is probably because the leader Laval recently made a statement saying, "France does not want to be the first to initiate anything in the final stage of U.S.-French relations." The White House, of course, does not want to bear the responsibility for severing diplomatic relations between the two countries. The tone of the American newspapers has also softened slightly in recent days. What is most noteworthy is the article by the famous reporter Lippmann, published in the New York Herald Tribune yesterday, strongly arguing that the United States should not act rashly towards France. The significance of this is especially great.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 9th, Haitong News Agency: It is rumored that President Roosevelt intends to send an ultimatum to the authorities on Martinique, demanding that the French aircraft carrier "Béarn" (23,346 tons), the light cruiser "Émile Bertin" (5,886 tons), and the "Jeanne d'Arc" (6,496 tons) anchored on the island be disarmed. The truth remains to be verified.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Switzerland, 8th, Havas News Agency: The "Geneva Tribune" recently published a telegram from its correspondent in London stating that British political figures are closely watching the development of U.S.-French relations, and are very pleased with the U.S.'s efforts to avoid the situation from becoming more serious. They also acknowledge that the French government leader Laval is also making every effort to avoid breaking off diplomatic relations with the United States. The "Basler Nachrichten" also published a telegram from its correspondent in London stating that Britain believes that the war on Madagascar is over, and that the speed of this progress is completely in line with the original expectations. The British side hopes that the time of conflict between the two sides will be as brief as possible, so as not to arouse animosity. From an emotional point of view, almost no one in London sympathizes with France. Prime Minister Churchill did not express sympathy for France in his speech in the House of Commons. However, all parties have stopped attacking Darlan and no longer speak of American intervention. According to the general impression, the current conflict on Madagascar should not be regarded as an act of war.</p>

<p>Reuters, Moscow, 9th – According to Red Star, the initial victories in the spring air battles in the Murmansk region belong to the Soviet Union. For the past six weeks, German and Finnish forces have launched a large-scale offensive against Soviet northern maritime traffic, posing a constant threat. This offensive involved a large number of aircraft under the command of General Stumpff, concentrated at bases in the Arctic region. Their tactic was to deploy formations of 20 bombers, escorted by fighters, each dropping no less than 1,000 bombs. In ten days, there were five attacks on the port of Murmansk, each involving about 37 aircraft. However, none of these attacks can be considered successful.</p>

<p>Reuters, Edinburgh, 8th – British Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a speech in Edinburgh tonight, looking forward to a new post-war world. The Foreign Secretary said, "We must sacrifice for peace. Before the outbreak of this war, we saw global fear and trembling, and after the war began, progress was extremely rapid. In the post-war world, there is no room for isolationism, selfish policies, or policies of suspicion towards neighbors. The British Empire can no longer adopt an isolationist policy; it must share the responsibility of leadership with other nations. We can no longer forget armaments, the meaning of peace, which cannot be represented by national borders or peace treaties; it must have strength and will. However, if the world cannot establish an economic system that provides work for men and women and provides them with the compensation they deserve, then there will be no peace on Earth. The Allied nations, working together, will possess the powerful strength necessary to take on the responsibility of policing, maintaining peace, and the major responsibility of post-war economic reconstruction will rest on the shoulders of Britain, America, China, and the Soviet Union."</p>

<h3 id="e27">Madagascar (3) - Economic Overview <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Madagascar experienced a significant economic crisis in 1927. The social conditions at that time were bleak, and the people’s livelihood was destitute. However, thanks to the intentional efforts of the ruling authorities over the years, the island has gradually recovered. Now, when a traveler from afar arrives in Antananarivo after a long train journey, he will be amazed by everything he sees. There are clean, wide asphalt roads, and tall, lush coconut trees sway gently in the tropical monsoon winds. On the quiet streets, he will see groups of local women wearing brightly colored dresses, smiling as they pass by. They have dark skin. Of course, you cannot compare them to a spoiled woman raised in Paris, but if you look at them with a different aesthetic eye, you will find that they have another kind of pure and simple beauty. They dance lightly, sing, and laugh during festivals. You may have come from those bustling cities, constantly oppressed by the noisy air and experiencing a suffocating pain. Then Antananarivo - this beautiful tropical city - will bring you another kind of freshness and vitality.</p>
<p>Madagascar is an island based on agriculture. Due to the suitable climate and fertile soil, the annual output is substantial. In particular, the soil along the plains near the Mozambique Channel in the eastern part of the island is of the highest quality. Farmers mostly cultivate during the rainy season and harvest after the dry season ends. Plants cultivated in this way generally have excellent yields. The main agricultural products in this area are rice, sugarcane, and cotton. Half of the total annual output is exported to the European continent.</p>
<p>The central plateau area, because of its higher altitude (averaging over 1,000 meters above sea level), is suitable for growing wheat, similar to the situation in Central Europe. This area is also a flourishing fruit cultivation region. In recent years, fruit varieties brought from France have been tested, and fruits such as apples, pears, grapes, and apricots have all produced excellent results. As for the northern part of the island, due to the hot climate, it is most suitable for planting coffee, cloves, and other spice plants during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Speaking of rice, this is the most important food for the islanders. Green rice paddies are scattered all over the island, especially in the Morovav area, which is a land of plenty. In the past, Madagascar once experienced a severe rice shortage, and a large amount had to be imported from Asia every year. Moreover, due to the backward agricultural technology at that time, the quality of rice was also uneven. However, since the selection and cultivation of specialized agricultural talents, Madagascar's rice production has not only become self-sufficient but has also become a major rice-producing region in the world. As a result of continuous experimentation, the quality of rice can now be compared with products from Malaysia and other places.</p>
<p>As a staple food for the islanders, there are also manioc (a type of Euphorbiaceae plant), beans, and taro. As for corn, the yield was very small in the past, but because the demand from neighboring islands was very high, the cultivation of this food attracted the attention of farmers on the island.</p>
<p>Animal husbandry, which is closely related to agriculture, also occupies an important position in the lives of the islanders. In the countryside, we can see almost all tenants raising livestock such as pigs and cattle. The vast grasslands in the Betsiles and Vohemar areas are the most ideal pastures. The islanders in the west regard livestock as their most important property. The most common animal raised in Madagascar is the zebu, a heavy and lazy animal with a huge body. If raised properly, its weight can often exceed 800 or 900 kilograms.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Madagascar is a region rich in mineral resources. They may first mention the gold mines here. In the past, gold mining almost became the main occupation of the islanders. But the reserves of gold mines are not inexhaustible. According to statistics, the output in 1912 was 1,996 kilograms, but with long-term development, the current output is less than 100 kilograms, a sharp decrease of 20 times in 30 years.</p>
<p>In fact, the most important mineral on the island is graphite, which is an indispensable raw material for the prosperous electrical industry of the 20th century. Apart from Sri Lanka having a large output, Madagascar is second only to it in the world. This mineral is mostly concentrated in the Antananarivo area, with an annual output of about 30,000 tons.</p>
<p>Madagascar is also a place with rich nickel ore reserves. Nickel ore is the most urgently needed raw material during wartime. According to reports from surveyors, the Vaiazoro area of Madagascar is estimated to be able to extract 400,000 tons of pure nickel per year. This is a very rich resource.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, Madagascar also produces iron, coal, oil, and a small amount of radioactive substances, but they are less important, so they are omitted.</p>

<h3 id="e35">Summer Anti-Epidemic Campaign Develops; Street Injections Implemented; Eight Injection Sites Set Up in the French Concession <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, Mr. Pilot, Director of the Health Department of the French Concession Municipal Council, disclosed yesterday (8th) that the anti-epidemic injection campaign in the French Concession has made great progress. To date, no fewer than 205,115 residents have been vaccinated.</p>
<p>Issuance of Vaccination Certificates</p>
<p>This year, because the anti-epidemic is being carried out in cooperation with the Japanese authorities, certificates are issued to those who receive the injections. In addition to setting up eight injection centers in the French Concession, the French Health Department has also sent mobile teams to large public and private organizations, schools, restaurants, factories, and apartments to administer vaccinations. Any location that applies for a mobile team to administer vaccinations can do so as long as there are a large number of people to be vaccinated. In order to complete this campaign, the health authorities have hired more doctors and nurses to assist. Police officers assist in street vaccinations to ensure the effectiveness of the work and maintain good order.</p>
<p>Strict Inspections</p>
<p>The anti-epidemic injection campaigns in the two concessions are now progressing smoothly. The Public Concession has scheduled to implement street injections starting tomorrow (11th). Those who do not have a certificate of anti-epidemic injection will find it inconvenient to walk on the street and will be subject to forced injection. In the French Concession, there are eight fixed injection sites, including 630 Rue Belles, 840 Avenue des Soeurs, the intersection of Route Heger and Route Say-Zoong, the iron gate of Nanyang Bridge, and the Laoximen intersection. The French Health Department's report finally reminded the public that, starting from May 5th, anyone entering or leaving the Japanese-occupied areas of South China must present a certificate of cholera and plague vaccination that is no more than six months old.</p>
<p>According to the French Concession Health Department, the anti-epidemic injection sites are 630 Route Belles, 840 Avenue des Soeurs, the small clinic on Route Tenant de la Tour, the St. Paul's Church site in Zikawei, the corner of Route Sagean and Route Heger, the iron gate on Route Tenant de la Tour, and the iron gate on Xinqiao Street in Laoximen. In addition to the original personnel, including five doctors, one veterinarian, eight Chinese and foreign nurses, and six injectors, the Health Department has also hired sixteen additional injectors and has received the enthusiastic assistance of nurses from the French Barracks and twenty clerks to assist in the anti-epidemic work. After the injections are administered, anti-epidemic certificates are issued. This work is being carried out quickly under the careful supervision of foreign personnel. In addition, the assistance from the police is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Xu Shaojiu of Haining is the literary grandson of Mr. Dishan, the owner of Xu Garden. Mr. Xu built a villa called Shuangqing Villa on Caobao Road, Tangjia Street, where he hosted elegant gatherings of famous people, splashing ink and applying paint. He was a man of many talents, skilled in painting. Xu Shaojiu inherited his legacy, diligently studying painting. His figures and landscapes have lofty artistic conceptions. His style traces back to the Song and Yuan dynasties, but he is not limited to the academic style. He secretly consulted his own ideas, but he is not involved in contemporary trends. The six principles of painting, especially the so-called "qi yun sheng dong" (spiritual consonance and vitality), are fully expressed in his works. However, he is modest and does not boast. Therefore, his works are rarely circulated, and it is often regrettable that he has not been able to obtain even a single piece of silk. Now, at the urging of his friends, he has produced his exquisite works for display at the Daxin Gallery, starting on the 11th of this month, for connoisseurs to appreciate.</p>

<h3 id="e46">Double Horse Yarn Factory Orders Still Plummeting, Another Rumor Claims Prices Will Rebound <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>In the cotton yarn market, spot prices continue to rise, but due to rumors of unreliable deliveries of Shuangma factory orders, market sentiment suddenly turned bearish, and market prices plummeted. (However, some say that Shuangma Yarn Factory's orders can still be delivered as usual; ten bales of yarn were seen being delivered on the evening of the 7th.) 42-count Blue Phoenix is priced at 13,650 yuan to 14,300 yuan, 60-count Five Sons at 23,000 yuan, 32-count Fairy Peach at 12,500 yuan, 32-count Flying Tiger at 9,500 yuan, 32-count Celestial Maiden at 10,450 yuan, 32-count Fairy Peach at 11,000 yuan, 20-count New Earth at 6,500 yuan to 6,600 yuan, 20-count Moon Harp at 6,300 yuan to 6,500 yuan, 20-count Shuangma at 6,450 yuan to 6,600 yuan, 20-count Blue Phoenix at 7,550 yuan to 7,660 yuan, 20-count Hongxi at 7,200 yuan, 18-count Weaver Girl at 6,400 yuan, 10-count Red Shuangma at 4,800 yuan to 5,050 yuan, 10-count Boy Scout at 4,800 yuan to 4,900 yuan, 16-count Red Kui Xing at 6,750 yuan to 6,800 yuan. The opening price for 20-count Shuangma factory orders was 5,350 yuan. At this time, there were many sellers on the market, and the market price plummeted to 4,860 yuan. Afterwards, there was a slight short-covering rally, closing at 4,960 yuan. However, off-market prices continued to fall by 100 to 200 yuan. Due to the sharp price drop, several companies are rumored to have defaulted.</p>
<p>Another report says that the price of cotton in the interior is rising daily. Based on the cost of raw materials and expenses, the total cost of each bale of 20-count yarn is nearly 7,000 yuan. (If the cotton price is 1,600 yuan per picul, calculated at 355 catties, the cotton cost is 5,680 yuan, plus an additional 1,200 yuan for expenses, totaling 6,880 yuan.) Therefore, the sharp drop and subsequent sharp rise in 20-count Shuangma factory orders is an inevitable trend in the market's price curve. Let's see which saying is correct.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Discussion on Cloth Sales: No Reason for Optimism, Fugui Factory Orders Suffer a Blow <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the cloth market remained in a state of fluctuation. In terms of actual sales, there was a lack of positive signs, but based on costs and the tight supply of existing goods, prices had no room to fall. Therefore, the opening price for Peach Blossom Ladies’ Forest Cloth was announced at 348 yuan to 349 yuan, but by the afternoon close, it had risen to 351 yuan, an increase of 1 yuan from the previous day. Although there were few transactions for other coarse and fine cloths, prices remained firm. For example, 16-pound Earth coarse cloth was priced at 260 yuan, Flying Goose at 250 yuan, and 12-pound Dapeng fine cloth at 235 yuan, with current spot prices for superior fine cloth at 218 yuan. However, Fugui factory orders suffered the same fate as Shuangma yarn factory orders, plummeting to 150 yuan, with no one inquiring.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Dragon Head was slightly soft, while Drill remained firm. The morning opening price for new orders of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was a low of 279 yuan. With fewer sellers and more buyers in the market, prices trended upwards, reaching a high of 283 yuan. The afternoon close saw a slight decrease, with the final price at 281.50 yuan, a decrease of 1.50 yuan. Mid-range miscellaneous brand fine cloths were neither up nor down. The opening price for Four Gentlemen Drill red orders was 9.23 yuan, rising to 9.367 yuan, then falling back to 9.32 yuan, an increase of 0.02 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Cash Stable <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The cash market was sluggish and the off-market initially showed firmness but then weakened, yet the overall trend remained stable. The sudden selling by two cash houses caused some unease. The initial transaction price in the morning was 21,750 yuan, rising by 50 yuan immediately. Securities houses came in to push the price up by 100 yuan, reaching 21,850 yuan, which led to the selling by cash houses and another securities house.

<p>The over-the-counter market for government bonds was very stable yesterday, with very little trading and a generally weak trend. However, there are still many potential changes in the future, which will undoubtedly cause fluctuations similar to those seen recently. Both bulls and bears are still conserving their strength and will not stop here. We can wait and see. Yesterday's trading was mainly for settling transactions and was very peaceful. Those with slightly larger volumes were Runde and Hu Heji on the selling side, and Tongyuan, Dai Yuxing, and Lianhe on the buying side. Xinyi and Zhenhua each bought 50,000 to 70,000 yuan, while Hongda, Yongchang, and Jiufeng had both buying and selling activity. However, there were slightly more purchases than sales, with supplies coming from Tongli, Baolong, Tongshun, Yichang, and Lianyi. As a result, except for Grade A, which was slightly better by 0.10 yuan, the rest were down by 0.10 to 0.20 yuan, with Grade B down by 0.50 yuan. The transaction volume was only 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below: Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day Unified A 66.80 66.60 66.80 Up 0.10 Unified B 60.20 60.00 60.10 Down 0.50 Unified C 60.30 59.50 59.50 Down 0.20 Unified D 55.50 54.80 54.90 Down 0.10 Unified E 57.30 56.40 56.90 Down 0.10</p>
<p>Yesterday, spot prices of foreign shares rose and fell unevenly, but the trend was relatively stable. A total of 9,800 shares of Chinese-registered stocks were traded during the half-day session, including 3,500 shares of Yeguang, which retreated from 26.5 yuan to 26 yuan. 2,500 shares of Zhongfang retreated from 21 yuan to 20.025 yuan. 2,000 shares of Zhongying retreated from 15.6 yuan to 15 yuan. 400 shares of Jardine Spinning rose from 37 yuan to 38 yuan. 200 shares of Kaiping were traded at 57.5 yuan and 57 yuan. 200 shares of Xiangtai Timber were traded at 36 yuan. 500 shares of Paper Industry were traded at 11.8 yuan. 500 shares of Xinhe were traded at 15.6 yuan. The rest were not traded.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to a letter from the Chinese members of the Public Industry Association, the 700 shares of Yeguang (foreign name) reported in yesterday's foreign stock news were, upon investigation, a factual error and should have been 700 shares of Gangye Chinese registered stocks. The association hereby makes a correction.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the decline in Chinese stocks attracted buying interest, stabilizing the market and increasing trading activity slightly. Wing On Co. was priced at 61.5 yuan, Sincere at 75 yuan, Lane Crawford at 26.5 yuan, China Underwear between 24 yuan and 23.75 yuan, Hongxing Hosiery had buying interest at 197.5 yuan, Dafeng Dyeing &amp; Weaving at 470 yuan, Star Perfumery at 225 yuan, New Asia Pharmaceutical (new) at 33.7 yuan, Sino-French (new) at 58.9 yuan, Five Continents at 215 yuan, China Bookstore rose from 115 yuan to 117.5 yuan, World (new) at 71.5 yuan, rumors of Beishui Electricity at 17.75 yuan, Huashang Leixun at 18 yuan, China Union Bank had buying interest at 85 yuan, Nanyang Brothers Tobacco at 54.5 yuan, and Great China Match had selling offers at 152 yuan.</p>

<p>The movement of edible oil in this city is difficult and is gradually being resolved. Supply is still smooth. According to recent statistics from the Edible Oil Trade Association, the daily distribution volume is between 1,500 and 2,000 dan. As a result, the black market has virtually disappeared. As for the fixed prices, raw oil is still priced at 1.075 yuan per catty in military currency, soybean oil at 1.025 yuan, and rapeseed oil and clear oil at 0.975 yuan.</p>
<p>The bean market slightly turned upward yesterday, due to rumors that the allocation of goods had not been fully implemented, causing market sentiment to gradually return to firmness. Red beans and silkworm red beans both rose by 3 to 5 yuan. Off-market prices for soybeans also tightened. A total of 140 packages of Chongming silkworm beans were offered at prices between 130 and 138 yuan, 100 packages of sand red beans were offered at a price of 235 yuan, 50 packages of Tianjin red beans were offered at a price of 225 yuan for self-delivery, and 50 packages of Pinghu red beans were offered at a price of 232.5 yuan for self-delivery. Due to the lack of arrivals, red sorghum turned upwards by 2 or 3 yuan as sellers raised prices. A total of 140 packages of Taizhou red sorghum were traded at a price of 165 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Commemorating Parents' Day <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Today is the second annual Parents' Day in China. Children with parents and those who are parents themselves cannot help but have various thoughts on this special occasion. Roughly speaking, at least half of the world's population is made up of men, women, and children. Therefore, on this annual holiday, children should respect their parents, and parents should take on their responsibilities as parents. Thus, Parents' Day can truly be said to be a holiday for all of humanity. Without parents, we would not exist or grow up. If we do not have children and raise them well, the nation cannot reproduce or become healthy.</p>
<p>Promoting the Virtue of Filial Piety</p>
<p>Starting with promoting the virtue of filial piety, our bodies and minds are all received from our parents. Our parents give us life and nurture us. Every change of season inevitably requires our parents to worry about us. There is no need to recount the daily care and love they provide, such as three meals a day. Therefore, Chinese people have always advocated filial piety. At the same time, Chinese history is full of famous mothers who taught their children to achieve fame, and Mencius's mother's choice of neighbors three times aligns with modern scientific principles of parenting. Mother Ou's teaching through writing in the ashes demonstrates a spirit of perseverance. Mother Yue's tattooing on her son's back proclaims loyalty and righteousness. These all occupy a glorious page in history and serve as examples for future parents. In addition, there are many valuable family letters that can prove the value of paternal teaching. Among modern figures, it is not difficult to cite several examples. Mr. Hu Shi, in his book "Forty Self-Narrative," mentioned how much he benefited from his mother's teaching. Mr. Zhao Jinqing had his calligraphic work on "Qiaosong Maoyin Cizhu Chunhui" printed to commemorate his parents. Mr. Xu Beihong had a painting depicting his mother educating her children. These are all things we have seen. In addition, there are many parents, especially mothers, who spare no effort and even use the meager money they earn from their hard work to plan for their children's education expenses. This is a truly great and praiseworthy thing. Therefore, on this Parents' Day, we should reflect on the gifts our parents have given us and find ways to repay them.</p>
<p>Promoting Parental Education</p>
<p>However, fulfilling our filial duty to the previous generation of parents is only half of our responsibility. If we have already become parents ourselves, then we should cultivate ourselves and do our best to educate our children. Because the birth of children is something that every couple without serious illness can achieve, we must be able to both give birth and raise them well, and educate them, in order to fulfill our responsibilities as parents. Washington's father was able to encourage honesty (if another father had heard Washington's honest story, he might have severely scolded him), Roosevelt's mother worked hard to raise her son, hoping that he would become an upright citizen, Edison's mother was able to understand everything about her son, and finally created a great inventor, and Shaw's mother was a musical genius, and her love of music had a great influence on Shaw.</p>
<p>Indeed, family education is more important than school education. We must not think that we have fulfilled our responsibilities as parents simply by sending our children to school. We must strive to cultivate our children in the home, to develop their beautiful character, good habits, and noble personality.</p>
<p>Relieving Distressed Parents</p>
<p>In addition, on this Parents' Day, there is also meaningful work to be done, which is to improve the welfare of parents. In addition to respecting our own parents, we should also respect the parents of others. When we encounter distressed parents, we should find ways to help them. This is both treating others' parents as we would our own and a manifestation of the spirit of human mutual assistance.</p>
<p>Parents' Day can pass quickly, but if we can work hard according to the three points mentioned above, then there will be more wise parents, more promising children, healthier families, and a more progressive society in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e53">My Mother (First Revelation of Short Writings) <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>The mother described here can be said to be a fighter who emerged from the shackles of old etiquette. She was able to bravely send her daughter to school. This spirit is indeed worthy of our admiration. — Editor</p>
<p>Grandmother had not wanted Mom to comb her hair for several days, and she would not respond when Mom called her. The reason was that Mom had not followed her wishes and had allowed me to study at the county middle school as a boarding student. So, whenever she saw guests who came to visit, she would sigh and say, "When a person gets old, they are like yellowed pearls, worthless. I'm old, and my words are outdated. 'Lack of talent in a woman is a virtue.' This is an ancient saying passed down through the generations. Girls of twelve or thirteen years old should be learning needlework at home, instead of being sent to a strange school to study. It's truly a misfortune for our family."</p>
<p>Because of this matter, Dad also blamed Mom a bit, often saying, "You spoil the child too much."</p>
<p>Grandmother's sarcasm and Dad's blame, but what could Mom do? Besides shedding tears in secret, she had no better way to vent. She often said to me when no one else was around, "Yu, you must strive to succeed, so that Mom won't be ridiculed by others in the future." I could only nod and shed crystal tears.</p>
<p>Time flew by quickly, and in the blink of an eye, it was time for school to start. The day before I left, Mom was packing my luggage. Her small feet, which made walking difficult, were moving back and forth without stopping. A light blue linen shirt was half-soaked with sweat. I asked her to rest for a while several times and let me do it myself. She just said, "It's hot, let me do it. You won't do it properly." She was busy until evening before she finished packing.</p>
<p>In the evening, Dad called me over and gave me fifty yuan, saying that it included food, tuition, and books. I accepted it with trembling hands. I couldn't complain about the small amount, nor could I allow myself to complain. This amount was still what Mom had spent great effort to argue for me.</p>
<p>The next day, as soon as dawn broke, Mom quietly woke me up and handed me twenty hot silver dollars, saying that they were her savings over time, for me to use as pocket money. I took the money, and tears soaked my eyes again. What I was holding was not just money, but Mom's burning heart!</p>
<p>After several twists and turns, thanks to Mom's help and my own determined struggle, I finally succeeded in becoming an elementary school teacher, which is despised by today's society. I have never been able to make Mom proud. When I returned home last winter, my luggage was still simple and my hands were empty. Although Mom still loved me the same, seeing Mom's teeth falling out, her hair turning gray, and gradually entering old age, my heart could not help but ache. How can I repay Mom for her past expectations of me!</p>
<h3 id="e54">Tears of a Loving Mother <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>The British physicist and chemist Faraday (1791-1867) started out as a laborer and worked hard to study, eventually being hailed as a leading figure in the world of physics. He once said:</p>
<p>"The tears of a loving mother, when analyzed chemically, are nothing more than a small amount of water and salt. But it must be known that in those tears flowing down her cheeks, there exists a noble and profound love that chemistry cannot analyze."</p>
<p>Two Songs of Love for Parents</p>
<h3 id="e55">(1) Good Parents <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Jinhua</p>
<p>Hands cradle the child's bed, turning the universe, teaching and nurturing with all their heart. Parents fulfill their duty. Children achieve success. All depends on parents. Talent, virtue, and grace. Father is important. Mother is important. Father and mother are equally important. With good parents, there are good people. Therefore, parents are important.</p>
<p>(2) If It Weren't for a Loving Mother</p>
<p>— Lan Fen</p>
<p>If it weren't for a loving mother, where would childhood joys be found? If it weren't for a loving mother, how could I have grown to this day? She spends all her strength, she spends all her heart, that love is truly endless! The child grows up, the mother ages, how shall I comfort her heart?</p>
<p>This publication will print 10,000 copies of Mr. Gao Tianqi's song "Mother" with music and lyrics, as well as the above two songs with simplified notation, for readers to request. Please send your letters to the editorial department of this publication, and they will be sent immediately, free of charge, but only while supplies last of 10,000 copies.</p>
<p>Love your parents with the same heart you love your wife, and your parents will be happy. Protect the nation with the same heart you protect your official position, and the nation will be governed well.</p>
<p>Nothing is greater than loyalty and filial piety. Loyalty is a treasure to a nation. Filial piety is a treasure to a family.</p>
<p>Don't be afraid of hard work when being filial. In the blink of an eye, you will be a parent yourself.</p>
<p>Filial piety, brotherly love, loyalty, trustworthiness, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame are the eight pillars that hold up the sky.</p>

<p>— Hua</p>
<p>The millionaires mentioned here are not millionaires with millions in assets, but our children! Because our children have millions of minutes available to them, and since time is the most priceless treasure in the world, then they are the luckiest and richest people in the world to have these millions of minutes. Take a ten-year-old child, for example. If they can live to seventy years old, they will have thirty million minutes. One-third of that time is spent sleeping, one-third is spent busy with life, and they still have one-third of their time left to cultivate themselves.</p>
<p>Regarding the value of maternal education, the book "Theory of Character," translated by Qin Tongpei, contains the following passage:</p>
<p>One good mother is worth a hundred school teachers. A good mother in the home is like a magnet in the heart, a North Star in the eye, towards which all children turn and gather, their minds all drawn to her.</p>
<p>Cooley once compared the influence of early childhood concepts to words carved on the bark of a young tree. The words on the bark grow with the tree, and so do the impressions of early childhood. When the impressions are first made, they are very small, but they gradually grow, and even in adulthood, they are difficult to erase.</p>
<p>Therefore, let us not forget the millionaires in our homes, and give them a good education in their youth, so that they can enjoy their valuable wealth when they become adults.</p>

<p>— Xiaojun</p>
<p>Motherly love is the most greatest. From this text, we can see a lovely, kind mother — Editor</p>
<p>When I was six years old, I started reading, reciting the dry and boring "Three Character Classic." Being dull-witted, I would often cry in frustration and not be able to recite it. Seeing that my older sister and brother could both recite it well, I felt very ashamed. So, my mother would gently comfort me, and then have my older sister teach me to read. I would follow along and respond. After just a few repetitions, I could recite it like an old woman chanting scriptures. In my childish mind at the time, I was left with the impression that my mother was the person who helped me overcome difficulties, and I felt my mother was very lovable.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in the year I turned ten, my older sister and brother passed away one after another. At that time, I was also suffering from a dangerous case of typhoid fever. My mother, having suffered a severe blow and weighed down by great worries, stayed by my bedside day and night, often going five or six days without sleep. Whenever I cried out in my sleep, she would immediately say, "Child, how do you feel?" One night, my mother called out to me, "Child! Take your medicine!" At that time, I felt that my mother had not slept for several days, so I said, "Mom! You should sleep for a while too!" Mom said, "I already slept and just got up." I turned my head and saw that Mom's bedding was neatly arranged, so I knew she hadn't slept. From then on, I understood that my mother was the person who cared most about my health.</p>
<p>In the spring of my thirteenth year, I was admitted to the first year of junior high school (this was the first time I had ever attended school). My mother told me what attitude I should have towards teachers and classmates. Because I had never attended school before, I didn't know what an exam was. At the end of the semester, I failed three subjects and needed to take a make-up exam to be promoted. I cried. And my mother? Instead, she comforted me and said, "Child! It's okay. It's because you don't know the rules of the school."</p>
<p>Once, my mother said to me, "Child! You are my only son, and you should make me proud. Don't let people say that I spoil you!" When I heard this, I thought that my mother wanted me to study usefully, so I held my books and read myself to death. I don't know how, but that year I developed asthma, which would flare up and then subside, and has not been cured to this day. My mother was worried day and night about it. As a result, her own health deteriorated day by day, and her hair gradually turned white. Whenever my asthma flared up, she would always stay up all night. Although my mother was very frugal with all expenses, she did not care about the large expenses for medical treatment.</p>
<p>Our school's regulations state that the student who graduates at the top of the third year of high school can receive a scholarship to go to university. At that time, I also had hopes of getting the scholarship. But unfortunately, I ended up getting second place. When I presented my graduation certificate and award certificate to my mother, my mother said, "Child! Did you not have any dubious actions (referring to cheating)!" I said with a straight face, "Mom! I would never disgrace you for the sake of vanity." At this time, I saw Mom smile genuinely for the first time. She also said, "A shameful first place is not as good as a glorious last place." Later, she further instructed me to go to that university. From then on, I knew that Mom not only cared about my health, but also cared about my personality even more.</p>
<p>A mother's love is noble and indescribable.</p>
