<p>美聯社據倫敦可靠消息斯達林公開要求開闢第二戰場雖已使英美左右為難但各該國當局不致因而變更其既定軍事計劃惟當趕速將軍需及原料接濟功聯斯達林之言論英美是否將正式予以答復倫敦方面揣測紛紜一般印象則以為英美尚保守緘默惟斯達林之露骨表示亦足使英美與蘇聯之關係日趨攜貳</p>
<p>華盛頓五日哈瓦斯社電</p>

<h3>華府倫敦報紙態度</h3>
<p>華盛頓五日哈瓦斯社電</p>
<p>關於斯達林昨向美國記者所發表之書面談話此間各報均揭載於顯著地位並加以評論大多認為斯達林係為立即開闢第二戰場一事所發出之緊急呼龥冀能影響美國與論迫令軍事領袖不得不立即在西歐發動攻勢例如華盛頓明星報外交訪員勃倫撰文稱美政府現在遭遇許多複雜問題原已頗感困難茲者斯達林所發出之呼龥僅能使美政府當局益感困難與紊亂而已惟是任何軍事計劃僅能且必須由軍事專家擬定之而不能顧及輿論界之願望一般民眾易受感情衝動而總司令部則以冷頭腦依據客觀事實加以判斷一次攻勢倘不幸而失敗則其結果所屆足使吾人在現行大戰中處於失利之地位紐約民聲講壇報對於輿論界企圖左右軍事領袖之主張一層亦表示反對略謂斯達林既認為開闢第二戰場係一非常重要之問題但其眞正之問題端正何時何地開闢第二戰場此則決非民眾之壓力所能解決換言之輿論界所能為者僅在明白表示願望一俟環境許可即當開闢第二戰場至於何時採取行動最為相宜則應聽由軍事領袖決定又紐約泰晤士報載稱協約國倘能出此必將於本年歲杪之前突然出擊但其出此決非斯達林之要求所致而必因其本身利益使然此外其他各報對於斯達林所謂協約國應充分並及時履行其義務一語均引以為異大多數美國作家認為協約國提供諾言援助蘇聯並不包括開闢第二戰場在內僅允以軍械接濟蘇聯而已</p>
<p>瑞典京城六日海通社電</p>
<p>此間報章載倫敦訪員來電稱斯達林所發有之文告不滿英美之作戰努力未能對蘇聯予以充份之援助一節初極引起倫敦人士之驚愕但各　之諱莫如深顯係唐寗街之授　意所致昨晨僅共產機關報每日工人報對斯達林文告有所評述力言開闢第二戰線不應再尚空談應作實際之行動倫敦半官方面似欲諱言斯達林文告之重要性略報邱吉爾自莫斯科回國後即以蘇聯不滿吳美援助之懚形告知下院但邱吉爾與羅斯福均深欲能儘速解救蘇聯之急</p>

<h3>跟著時代需求舊貨市場的勃興整新技七令人驚異</h3>
<p>本報專訪</p>
<p>商業中有三百六十行由是舊貨業則不在其內近年以來上海收舊貨一行生意非常發達利潤亦頗豐厚蓋其買賣出入甚大外行人竟旬明其究竟舊貨不能　正式商品買賣可比舊貨物件不能與正式商店之貨物並論交易大不相同</p>
<h3>區域的擴展</h3>
<p>經營一者大都係蘇常一帶的人居多沿街穿弄肩挑空藍或買或賣或設攤搜羅或租店面開設舊貨店其地址英租界在滿庭坊和虹廟弄法租界平濟利路自戰後現已擴展至斜橋及寗波路一帶亦已成為舊貨市場陳列銅錫器皿古畫古瓶衣服皮鞋碗具及日常所用椅檯桌櫈碗筷刀叉無線電收音機留聲機唱片銅鐵床等什麼都有出售但是要買這種東西非（門檻精）不可還要識貨會還價有時尚可出極低的代價而得到名貴的東西假使買的人不識貨還是不去塌便宜的好</p>
<h3>還價相差十倍</h3>
<p>舊貨攤上的東西比不得商店裹的物品各商店中之物品為了保持信譽劃一不二老少無欺相信就買不討虛頭那是表示其牌子硬（一般滑頭店不在其內）但是舊貨攤上做生意卻不然一件普通的東西討價五十元你還他五元居然就會賣給你討價還價相差十倍眞令人難以置信</p>
<h3>舊貨反比新貨好</h3>
<p>談到舊貨店的東西其所陳列之各種物件來源是從各方搜集而來並沒有什麼廠家號家行家批發來的更不需要定貨製造這又是和一般商店裹的物品不同了</p>
<p>現在各種物價狂漲驚人普通家庭置備應用物品新的貨物價貴辦不起就很多向舊貨攤上去買因為舊貨價格比較新的物品低廉得多有時比新的出品經用此因新的出品物資緊縮一切物件之製造原料莫不偷工減料以致新的出品反不如舊出品的物件質料好在使用方面不及舊貨的經久耐用</p>
<h3>里弄中之搜求者</h3>
<p>自戰後之舊貨生意特別發達遂形行業的特殊發展在每個弄堂或小衖裹一天到晚不斷來往收舊貨的很多此去彼來每個里衖一天終有十幾個收舊貨的叫喊著阿有洋瓶申報紙賣　阿有舊貨賣銅鈿　可見得收舊貨利潤豐厚夠得使人羨慕所以才有這許多人做這行商業</p>
<h3>一種可愛技巧</h3>
<p>收舊貨的生意的確有一本萬利譬如你有舊東西賣給他們三文不值二文他們收了去修理一新不識貨的人看不出是舊貨他們加上收本好幾倍或十外倍出賣有人買去了這種技巧眞正可愛有時他們收到很貴重的東西而出賣的人不識貨或是一種偷來的東西由偷兒賣給他們那麼就要煞價更兇收舊貨的人遇到這種主顧是算最幸運的了是以做舊貨生意發財的人多呢</p>
<h3>同行互通聲氣</h3>
<p>收舊貨的生意聽說也有行家一般伶牙俐齒堂裹來往收到了舊貨都是轉售給予行家出賣同時他們也有連絡各舊貨商互通聲氣譬如你有幾樣東西要賣掉第一個收舊貨的人上門來看了還了價錢你嫌太便宜不賣給他但是等到第二個收舊貨的來還不及第一個的價高蓋已通聲氣了再不賣給他的話第三個來要實行煞價了總而言之各舊貨商的互通聲氣使得某處欲賣掉的東西每個收舊貨者出價都是相彷的你假使欲得善介而活那第四第五就不來問津了這也是他們同行人為共同利益而幫助倒是值得稱頌的</p>
<h3>弋獲盜犯吊出贓物盼失主認贓</h3>

<h3>German Forces in Northwest Stalingrad Fiercely Attack Steel Plant Area with Hundreds of Tanks Assisting; Soviets Launch New Offensive in the South of the City</h3>
<p>Stockholm, June 6th, Havas News Agency</p>
<p>From the Stalingrad front, German forces launched their twelfth attack yesterday on the steel plant area in the northwest of the city. The intensity of the attack was unprecedented, with the attacking forces comprising three infantry divisions, hundreds of tanks, and numerous aircraft. The defending forces' lines were breached in one location. In the southwest of the city, Soviet forces intensified their offensive, and German forces counter-attacked several times in an attempt to relieve the pressure on their left flank. Soviet forces within the Don River bend claimed to have expanded their gains from the bridgehead. According to German military reporters, the "Torch" steel plant in northwest Stalingrad is comparable in scale to the Bethlehem Steel plant in the United States and Germany, with closely packed furnaces and stacks. Although much of it has been destroyed by German aircraft and artillery, it still provides favorable defensive positions. On the Caucasus front, the German offensive against Grozny has reached its climax, and the defending forces are gradually retreating. As for Moscow, yesterday's Soviet communique stated that after three days of fierce fighting, they had repelled the "Blood Clot" army six miles and captured a hilltop.</p>
<p>The battle on the Ukrainian border continued throughout the day. The latest reports indicate that German mechanized units have reached a point about two miles from the right bank of the Volga River. In the Don River area, the Red Army appears to have launched a new offensive against German positions south of Stalingrad. Fierce fighting is taking place for control of various points along the Volga River facing Stalingrad. Red Army units have successfully landed between Kalach and the western Volga River areas of Pikshetuvka and Charchinaga. German forces immediately launched a counter-attack, and the battle is still ongoing. It is reported that the Red Army is using a large number of heavy artillery in the Gurasno-Armeysk district. In the western Caucasus, the Red Army made two landings on the night of the 4th of this month, the first northwest of Novorossiysk and the second on the southern coast of the Taman Peninsula. It is reported that after fierce fighting, the Red Army has completely retreated to its original positions. German forces have cleared the entire Taman Peninsula of enemy presence. The Red Army's main objective seemed to be to sabotage enemy facilities.</p>
<p>Ankara, June 6th, Reuters</p>
<p>According to news from Moscow this morning, German reinforcements have already arrived in the workers' district north of Stalingrad. It is rumored that the Germans are using three infantry divisions and hundreds of tanks, with the assistance of aircraft. Street fighting is ongoing in a certain town on the Mostok line.</p>
<h3>Soviets Set Up Tank Traps on Upper Terek River to Hinder German Advance; Fierce Fighting in Northwest Caucasus</h3>
<p>Berlin, June 6th, Reuters</p>
<p>According to news from the front last night, German pressure on the Terek front has intensified. Soviet forces have laid mines and set up tank traps on the upper Terek River in an attempt to hinder the German advance. German sappers uncovered 1,500 mines in a small village near El'khotovo. With the assistance of bombers, German forces captured several fortified positions of the Soviet army that were heavily defended, and repelled a Soviet counter-attack. The German Air Force bombed the Soviet rear supply routes, destroying 135 Soviet vehicles, and damaging roads in many places, severely affecting the Soviet supply in the mountains. Soviet anti-aircraft and flat-trajectory artillery units were also blocked en route, unable to reach their destinations. After the Soviets tried various methods to hinder the German advance without success, they are now using cavalry northeast of Mostok to impede the Germans, but this resistance was quickly overcome by machine guns, causing heavy casualties to the Soviet cavalry. German forces captured 400 Soviet prisoners; the remaining Soviet troops were able to avoid annihilation due to their swift retreat. German forces are attacking Soviet positions in the northwest Caucasus, and fierce fighting is currently underway. German bombers heavily attacked the port facilities of Tuapse, and escorting German fighters shot down eight Soviet aircraft.</p>
<p>Sulek, June 5th, Central News Agency</p>
<p>German forces launched a new offensive on the Caucasus front, heavily bombing the Grozny oil fields with 200 aircraft. On the evening of the 4th, over 100 tanks broke into Soviet positions.</p>
<p>Berlin, June 6th, Reuters</p>
<p>El'khotovo, recently occupied by German forces, is located on the railway line between Rostov and Baku and is the terminus of the Ossetian military highway. The road extends 293 kilometers from El'khotovo to Kutaisi. The town's industries, besides a few small-scale canned fruit factories, are primarily local in nature.</p>
<h3>German-Soviet War Reports</h3>
<p>German Headquarters, June 6th, Reuters</p>
<p>This afternoon's German war report stated that yesterday's fighting in the Caucasus was intense. Enemy forces defending high ground were forced to retreat in several locations, and many of the enemy's fortifications defending the mountainous areas of Tuapse and the Terek region were captured. Fierce fighting is occurring in Stalingrad, with German aircraft assisting ground forces. Another enemy unit in the northwest of the city is about to be surrounded. On the Don front, Romanian and Hungarian forces repelled an enemy attempt to cross the river. Many enemy bunkers in the central sector were destroyed. Our forces southeast of Lake Ilmen gained further ground yesterday.</p>
<p>Moscow, June 5th, Havas News Agency</p>
<p>The Red Army General Staff announced in today's war report that our forces continued to fight fiercely in the Stalingrad and Mostok areas on the 1st. There were no major changes in other war zones. According to official sources, the fighting in the Stalingrad area remains extremely intense. German forces launched a large-scale attack on a certain industrial area of the city, and only after suffering heavy losses were they able to repel the Red Army. In other areas, German forces launched repeated attacks but were unsuccessful, and the positions of Soviet defending forces northwest of Stalingrad have seen improvement.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Change in Red Army Command Denied by Soviets</h3>
<p>Stockholm, June 6th, Havas News Agency</p>
<p>Foreign sources have rumored that General Shaposhnikov, Chief of Staff of the Soviet Army, has replaced Stalin as Commander-in-Chief of the Red Army. Moscow has solemnly denied this. It is said that the rumor originated from the Soviet radio station referring to General Shaposhnikov, on the occasion of his sixtieth birthday, as one of the highest leaders of the Red Army.</p>
<h3>Japanese Special Submarine Attacks Sydney; Naval Personnel Sacrifice After Four Days of Battle</h3>
<p>Onboard the Kamakura Maru, June 6th, Domei News Agency</p>
<p>Four Japanese naval personnel who died in the attack on Sydney Harbour on the east coast of Australia by a Japanese submarine are now being repatriated to Japan as ashes on this repatriation ship. These four men, on the night of May 31, entered the naval base of Sydney Harbour in a specially built submarine and died in the face of intense enemy fire. Afterwards, the Australian authorities announced that an Australian supply ship had sunk, killing nine, with ten missing and some injured. It was also reported that two Japanese mini-submarines were sunk, and another was thought to have been sunk as well. According to Australian newspapers, the Japanese submarine entered Sydney Harbour, launching torpedoes and bombing the harbor facilities, heavily damaging warships and other ships. The four Japanese naval warriors then died in the fierce artillery fire from both land and sea. The Australian authorities then held a naval funeral for these Japanese naval personnel in Sydney on June 9. The four coffins were covered with the Japanese flag. Rear Admiral Golt, Commander of the Sydney Naval Base, delivered a broadcast speech praising the bravery of the four. The Australian authorities subsequently obtained the consent of Mr. Kawa, the Japanese Minister to Australia under detention, to cremate the four bodies and hand them over to Mr. Kawa on August 17, who took them on the diplomatic personnel exchange ship Cantonbury Castle from Melbourne to Laurenco Marques, then transferred to the Kamakura Maru for return to Japan.</p>
<p>Tokyo, June 5th, Central News Agency</p>
<p>According to a telegram from the exchange ship Kamakura Maru, a special submarine successfully attacked Sydney Harbour in Australia on May 31, completing its mission of heavily damaging enemy port military facilities, and then exploded and sank on its own. At that time, four brave warriors sacrificed themselves with the submarine. Minister Kawa in Australia held a memorial service on the Kamakura Maru on September 16. It is also reported that when the special submarine attacked Sydney, Domei News Agency correspondent Ando, who was detained on the coast of Australia, was also on the way back to Japan on the Kamakura Maru. According to his account of the situation when the Japanese submarine attacked Sydney, the ship exploded as if the sky had fallen and the earth had split, followed by a hundred-foot-high column of water. The searchlights on the shore frantically scanned the sky before turning to the sea. At that time, the situation in the harbor was extremely chaotic. When the bombs exploded, most of the ships on the water collided with each other, causing them to sink. The sight of old and young men and women screaming in panic was extremely tragic.</p>

<h3>Bishop of Birmingham Reviews Situation in India; Hopes Roosevelt Will Mediate</h3>
<p>Birmingham, June 5th, Havas News Agency</p>
<p>Dr. Barnes, the Bishop of Birmingham, reviewed the current situation in India in a speech to transport workers here today and hoped that President Roosevelt would mediate. He stated that pacifists today are often misunderstood. For example, Mahatma Gandhi of India is often called pro-Japanese because he does not want to fight Japan. But in reality, Gandhi has been engaged in the independence movement and using his power to influence the Indian nation for 30 years and has had a clear policy. His only desire is the freedom of India. He firmly believes that violence should not be used to achieve political goals, and nothing can change his policy or forget his purpose. He has been summoned to meet with the Viceroy of India and has been imprisoned for a long time, but neither of these methods has been able to influence his beliefs. Some may advise you not to trust Gandhi, but do not listen to such remarks. I firmly believe that Gandhi will respect some of the strengths of our nation. The unfortunate events that have occurred in the past may have been forgotten in our country, but in India, painful memories often arise. For example, British manufacturers in India are becoming increasingly developed, but these people often show arrogance towards Indians. Therefore, although we have initiated the industrial revolution in India with one hand, we have at the same time created a great sin. Our administration is completely bureaucratic, lacking initiative and enthusiasm, so Indians have never had the opportunity to improve their environment and build a new order. After being in a state of slavery for a hundred years, there is no chance to turn over. At this time, this situation is difficult to maintain. I believe that the British government should immediately negotiate with Indian leaders, and I hope that President Roosevelt may one day be able to mediate.</p>

<h3>U.S. Mississippi-Class Battleship Sunk in Atlantic Ocean off the Coast of Freetown, West Africa; Rome Announced Italian Submarine Victory Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Rome, June 6th, Domei News Agency</p>
<p>The authorities announced this afternoon that an Italian submarine torpedoed and sank a 33,000-ton U.S. Mississippi-class battleship in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Freetown (British West Africa) in the early hours of today. The submarine was the Barbarigo, commanded by Major Grossi. At 2:35 a.m. today, it fired four torpedoes that struck the U.S. battleship. The Italian submarine Barbarigo had previously sunk the U.S. battleship Maryland in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of South America, which was the first major victory of the Italian side against the U.S. Navy. Now that the submarine has sunk another U.S. battleship, it has caused a sensation in the Italian capital, as broadcast by Radio Rome. Today's communiqué stated that the submarine Barbarigo, commanded by Major Grossi, at 2:35 a.m. Italian time, launched an attack at 2 degrees 15 minutes north latitude and 14 degrees 25 minutes east longitude, about 330 miles southwest of Freetown, West Africa, against an American Mississippi-class battleship traveling at 13 miles per hour. The ship was hit by four torpedoes and sank. There are three U.S. Mississippi-class battleships: the Mississippi, the New Mexico, and the Idaho, all launched when the United States participated in World War I in 1917. They displace between 33,000 and 34,000 tons, and their average speed is 22 miles per hour. They have a peacetime crew of 1,565. In 1933, the three battleships were completely renovated. They are equipped with twelve 356 mm and twelve 127 mm guns, eight 127 mm anti-aircraft guns, and can carry three aircraft.</p>

<h3>U.S. Troops Continue Landing in West Africa, Apparently Preparing to Attack Dakar</h3>
<p>Paris, June 6th, Reuters</p>
<p>The large-scale landing of U.S. troops in West Africa has attracted great attention from newspapers here, who say that this action is making the U.S.'s ambition to occupy African territories increasingly obvious.</p>
<p>Lisbon, June 5th, Central News Agency</p>
<p>It is reported that Britain and the United States will soon begin an attack on the French naval base of Dakar in West Africa. Governor-General Darlan has ordered the French fleet to mobilize for defense. People familiar with military affairs here recently talked about the opinion that Britain and the United States will attack Dakar: First, General Tegoul is currently traveling and inspecting French Equatorial Africa, and because of the continuous U.S. troop landings in West Africa, it has been determined that the attack on Dakar is increasingly urgent. Second, when U.S. Navy Admiral Knox visited Natal, Brazil, in South America, he talked about the port of Natal, Brazil, being the best naval and air base in the world. Natal Port and Dakar Port are the shortest sea routes in the Atlantic. Knox's remarks were an attempt to prepare for an attack on Dakar, Africa.</p>
<p>Stockholm, June 6th, Reuters</p>
<p>British forces in Madagascar issued a communiqué yesterday stating that since the landing in Madzinga, British forces have advanced 160 miles in 23 days.

<h3>British and American Military Plans Unchanged, Intensifying Aid to the Soviet Union, Stanley K. Informal Talks, Demanding Explanation for Stalin's Remarks</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 6th, Allied Press</p>
<p>According to a United Press dispatch from Moscow, after Stalin publicly demanded yesterday that the Allied nations immediately open a second front and stated that the Allied nations' aid was of little effect, U.S. Rear Admiral Stanley and British Ambassador Sir Cole informally discussed the matter yesterday and plan to demand an explanation for certain phrases in Stalin's remarks.</p>
<p>Bern, 6th, Allied Press</p>
<p>According to reliable sources in London reported by the Associated Press, although Stalin's public demand for the opening of a second front has caused the British and Americans considerable difficulty, the authorities in those countries will not change their established military plans because of it. However, they will expedite the supply of military supplies and raw materials to the Soviet Union. Whether the British and Americans will formally respond to Stalin's remarks is a matter of much speculation in London. The general impression is that the British and Americans are remaining silent for now, but Stalin's blunt expression is enough to make relations between the British and Soviets increasingly strained.</p>
<p>Washington, 5th, Havas Agency</p>
<p>After Stalin avoided American reporters and issued a written statement yesterday, Under Secretary of State Welles declared that the United States must do everything possible to assist the Soviet army and that our policy remains unchanged and needs no further explanation. When a reporter asked about the significance of President Roosevelt's special envoy to the Vatican, Myron C. Taylor, visiting London, the Under Secretary of State immediately replied that Special Envoy Taylor has many friends in London and that it is only natural for him to take advantage of this trip to Europe to visit old friends in England.</p>
<h3>Attitude of Washington and London Newspapers</h3>
<p>Washington, 5th, Havas Agency</p>
<p>Regarding the written statement that Stalin made to American reporters yesterday, the newspapers here have all published it in prominent positions and commented on it. Most believe that Stalin is issuing an urgent call for the immediate opening of a second front, hoping to influence American public opinion and force military leaders to launch an offensive in Western Europe immediately. For example, Walter Lippmann, a foreign affairs correspondent for the Washington Star, wrote that the U.S. government is now encountering many complex problems and is already feeling quite difficult. Stalin's call can only make the U.S. government authorities feel even more difficult and disorganized. However, any military plan can only and must be drawn up by military experts and cannot take into account the wishes of public opinion. The general public is easily swayed by emotions, while the General Staff judges based on objective facts with a cold head. If an offensive unfortunately fails, the result will put us at a disadvantage in the current war. The New York Post also expressed opposition to the claim that public opinion attempts to control military leaders, stating that Stalin believes that opening a second front is a very important issue, but the real issue is when and where to open the second front. This is definitely not something that public pressure can solve. In other words, what public opinion can do is only to clearly express the desire to open a second front as soon as circumstances permit. As for when it is most appropriate to take action, it should be left to the military leaders to decide. The New York Times reported that the Allied nations, if they could, would launch a sudden attack before the end of this year, but that this would not be due to Stalin's request, but because of their own interests. In addition, other newspapers found Stalin's statement that the Allied nations should fully and promptly fulfill their obligations to be strange. Most American writers believe that the Allied nations' promise to assist the Soviet Union does not include opening a second front, but only providing the Soviet Union with military equipment.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 6th, Reuter</p>
<p>Local newspapers carry dispatches from London reporters stating that Stalin's statement, which expressed dissatisfaction with the British and American combat efforts and their failure to provide sufficient assistance to the Soviet Union, initially caused astonishment among Londoners. However, everyone avoided the topic, which was clearly instructed by Downing Street. Only the communist newspaper, the Daily Worker, commented on Stalin's statement yesterday morning, strongly advocating that the opening of a second front should no longer be empty talk, but should be put into practice. Semi-official London sources seemed to want to downplay the importance of Stalin's statement, briefly reporting that after Churchill returned from Moscow, he informed the House of Commons of the Soviet Union's dissatisfaction with American aid. However, both Churchill and Roosevelt deeply desire to relieve the Soviet Union's urgency as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Tension on the Egyptian Front, Major War About to Break Out, British Troops Probing Everywhere, German and Italian Forces Intensifying Air Activity</h3>
<p>Rome, 5th, Havas Agency</p>
<p>In recent days, the general public here has been asking whether the British have completed their preparations on the Egyptian front and are about to launch the long-awaited offensive. There are certain facts that lead people to believe that a large-scale offensive is about to break out. Let us try to discuss them separately. 1. The British army is currently probing everywhere, especially on the southern front. The British armored forces in that area are testing the resistance of the German and Italian forces. 2. In recent weeks, the British Air Force has been extremely active, bombing the Axis forces' rear areas at night in order to disrupt their formation. 3. The British Navy has also repeatedly attempted to intercept Italian convoys between the Italian mainland and the African coast. But one thing can be asserted: whether the British army launches a formal offensive or is merely bluffing, the Axis forces will definitely not lie down and wait to be slaughtered. The German and Italian aircraft's recent deep bombing of the enemy's rear areas is sufficient proof of our strict precautions. Moreover, the scope of these air raids extends to the Nile River region. Various railway lines in that area have been bombed, and the Qufra oasis, the base of the armored forces, which is often used as a base for attacking Italian outposts, has also been bombed.</p>
<p>Cairo, 5th, Havas Agency</p>
<p>The British Middle East Headquarters recently issued a war report stating that there was a sentry clash on the Egyptian front on the night of the 3rd of this month, but it subsided by dawn the next day. In addition, both sides' air forces were very active.</p>
<p>Berlin, 6th, Reuter</p>
<p>German dive bombers repeatedly bombed enemy positions on the Egyptian front the day before yesterday. Enemy tanks and concentrated troops suffered heavy damage. All the bombs hit their targets. The enemy troops were in a very embarrassing situation after being bombed. At the same time, German light fighter planes launched low-altitude attacks on enemy motor vehicle columns. Many bombs hit the southern section of the Al Alamein front, destroying many vehicles. Enemy bombing was ineffective.</p>
<p>Ankara, 6th, Reuter</p>

<p>Istanbul, 6th, Reuter</p>
<p>The gambling king, Orlo, who bankrupted the Monte Carlo bank, has died in Istanbul.

<h3>After the Air Raid Alarm is Issued, Vehicles Must Turn Off Their Lights and Stop, Smoking and Using Flashlights are Prohibited, and Special Attention Must be Paid to Window Lights</h3>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that a senior official of the Public Concession Air Defense Committee recently explained the difference between the regulations applied during the air raid alert period and the air raid alarm period, stating that in these two different periods, windows must not reveal light. However, during the alert period, traffic may continue as usual (car lights must be partially covered), and pedestrians may also walk freely on the left. When the air raid alarm is issued, all traffic stops, and all vehicles, large and small, must turn off their lights and stop until the alarm is lifted. Pedestrians must also stop and remain in place for about ten minutes before they can move forward. Citizens who want to know whether the nighttime light control is an air raid alert or an air raid alarm must listen to the broadcast report of the Great Eastern Radio Station. Other radio stations will stop broadcasting.</p>
<p>The Public Concession Police Department issued a notice yesterday stating that: 1. In the area where an air raid alarm has been issued, all vehicles must turn off their engines and stop by the side of the road and are not allowed to drive until the alarm is lifted. 2. Pedestrians must take shelter by the side of the road when an air raid alarm is issued and may proceed after ten minutes. 3. Smoking, lighters, and flashlights are prohibited during an air raid alarm. Violators will be severely punished.</p>
<p>The exercise went well last night.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the sixth day of the light control exercise in the two concessions. Because the results of the first few days were not very satisfactory, the control was tightened considerably yesterday. When the Great Eastern Radio Station broadcast the start of light control at 7:00 p.m., all the lights in the city were covered, and the entire Shanghai was immersed in darkness. At 7:50 p.m., the Great Eastern Radio Station broadcast that the first light control exercise had ended. However, the lights of shops did not come on again after the end of the exercise, while the street lights remained off throughout.</p>
<p>Illumination bombs</p>
<p>The exercise from 7:00 p.m. to 7:50 p.m. last night was only light control. At 7:15 p.m., Japanese planes flew over the city's central area and the Jing'an Temple area and dropped an illumination bomb each. The Japanese planes disappeared after circling the city. Although the Great Eastern Radio Station reported at 7:50 p.m. that the first exercise had ended, the lights of shops were still strictly controlled, and the whole city was still as dark as lacquer. However, various vehicles were still driving as usual with their lights covered.</p>
<p>Armored vehicles dispatched</p>
<p>At 8:30 p.m., the Great Eastern Radio Station reported that the exercise had ended. The French Concession also lifted the exercise at 10:10 p.m. According to a senior official of the Air Defense Section, the results of last night's exercise have shown significant progress. Air raid alert exercises may begin today or tomorrow, and all rescue and firefighting personnel must be dispatched. Roads must be blocked for ten to fifteen minutes during an air raid alert.</p>
<p>Exercises are based on districts</p>
<p>According to the Datong News Agency, the supplementary housing offices in various districts of the two concessions issued another notice yesterday instructing the liaison chiefs to instruct the baojia chiefs and residents. The contents are divided into five points: 1. Air defense exercises are based on results. The authorities will only lift the restrictions when they are satisfied that light control and all precautions are completely satisfactory. 2. The air defense of this concession is based on districts. If this district has sufficient light control and all precautions, the authorities deem it satisfactory, and this district can be lifted first, regardless of what happens in other districts.</p>
<p>Bao chiefs should be fully responsible</p>
<p>3. The bao chief should be fully responsible for light control. If a household is found to have exposed lights or is incomplete, the bao chief should be responsible for guiding them. 4. If the residents do not obey the bao chiefs' guidance, their door number and name will be recorded together and reported to this office for investigation. 5. If the residents do not pay attention to air defense light control and all air defense equipment, the bao chief will report to this office, and their citizen certificates will be revoked. When the equipment is complete, this office will send personnel to check before the citizen certificates are returned. If the above situation occurs more than twice, this police station will punish them most severely in accordance with the air defense regulations.</p>
<p>Senior officials conduct group inspection</p>
<p>According to a report from the Allied Press, the Japanese naval and army special service commander, at the invitation of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Air Defense Section, took a large number of Municipal Council officials, such as Director Okazaki, Police Commissioner Watanabe, Deputy Commissioner Gotō, and Air Defense Section Chief Matsumoto Gorō, to conduct the first inspection of light control at 9:45 p.m. last night. The inspection lasted for about twenty-five minutes, and Okazaki and Matsumoto Gorō reported to him that the results of the exercise had improved. At the same time, the commander also lingered briefly in the Old Zhabei police station and listened to the police station's exercise report. After the light control was lifted, the commander again went to the upper floors of the Wing On Company to inspect the night market, and the inspection was completed at about 10:50 p.m.</p>
<p>Measures for doctors to go out for consultations</p>
<p>French Concession Passive Defense Notice No. 10 is a notice stating that when a doctor encounters a patient calling for emergency treatment during an air defense exercise, he may notify the police station near his residence so that someone can accompany him. Please be aware of this.</p>
<h3>Baojia Expand Publicity and Fundraising Campaign</h3>
<p>The baojia expansion publicity and fundraising campaign held by the Municipal Council's Baojia Guidance Committee has been going well in general for the past two days since it began. Five-colored and bright cartoons and slogans with alerting significance can be seen everywhere on the streets. Large banners are displayed in front of major buildings such as the Wing On Company and the Hanerdun Building, and pedestrians stop to watch. Unconsciously, people can deeply understand the meaning of baojia self-defense. Since the fundraising campaign was launched, it has been warmly supported by all walks of life, and it is expected that it will not be difficult to achieve the planned target. It is learned that in addition to text, cartoon, and film mobile propaganda, the Baojia Committee will also hold a propaganda music concert at the Grand Cathay Theatre on the afternoon of National Day, with famous musicians from the city responsible for the program. Citizens must enter with tickets, and it is expected that there will be a grand occasion. On the afternoon of the 11th, at 1:00 p.m., a grand parade of hundreds of thousands of self-defense corps in the Public Concession will be held, which is probably the first time in the history of the Public Concession and has profound significance.</p>

<p>Zou Yunsheng, a 48-year-old man from Yuyao, who lived at No. 16, Lane 156, Carre Ziel Road, was formerly a Chinese detective in the French Concession Police Department. After being dismissed for something, he is now engaged in the real estate business and has a small amount of savings that can still make ends meet. He usually has a self-defense pistol. Recently, one of Zou's sons was suffering from lung disease, and Zou had been going to various gambling houses in the Nanshi Nine Acres Yong'an Yuanbao area for several days, losing tens of thousands of yuan, which caused him a major shock. Zou suddenly took his self-defense pistol in his room at 1:10 p.m. on the 5th and fired a shot into his chest. The bullet pierced his back and came out.

<h3>Fifteen-Year-Old Boy Squanders Money on Prostitution and Gambling, Commits Suicide by Swallowing Opium</h3>
<p>Lou Jingen, a 15-year-old boy from Ningbo who lived at No. 137, Glock Road, Baxianqiao, lost his father, Lou Baogen (also known as Genbao), on the 16th day of the first lunar month this year. He still has a widowed mother, Mrs. Li (35 years old this year), at home. Jingen has no brothers or sisters and is an only child. He has been spoiled since childhood. Since his father's death, he has lost control, dropped out of school, roamed around, made bad friends, and engaged in prostitution and gambling. He has squandered a lot of money in the past eight months. Whenever he runs out of money, he goes home to steal his mother's hidden money or sell clothes to spend it recklessly. Although his mother, Mrs. Lou Li, has tried to teach and discipline him in every way, she has achieved little effect. Recently, he stole his mother's hidden money, nearly a thousand yuan, for the fifth time, and went out for several days and nights, recklessly engaging in prostitution and gambling. When he ran out of money, he sneaked home in the afternoon of the 5th and thought that his sins were too deep and he had no face to see his mother, so he committed suicide by swallowing raw opium. At 8:00 p.m. that night, his mother found him and reported it to the police and sent him to the hospital, but it was too late to save him. The body was transferred to the coroner's office. Yesterday, his mother claimed it for burial.</p>

<h3>Consular Body Authorizes Municipal Council to Control Industry Associations</h3>
<p>Allied Press local news: The consular body will soon authorize the Municipal Council to issue orders to various industry associations because the consular body has received instructions from various governments to allow it to grant this authority to the Municipal Council. When the price regulation measures are implemented in the Public Concession, various industry associations and chambers of commerce appeal to amend the price limits because their losses are quite large. The authorities then convene meetings of various associations and approve the fair and highest prices they submit for approval. It is expected that when the Municipal Council obtains the authority to issue orders to various associations, the proposed amended price limits will be recognized as official price limits.</p>

<h3>Following the Demands of the Times, the Rise of the Secondhand Market, the Repair Skills are Amazing</h3>
<p>Exclusive Interview with This Newspaper</p>
<p>There are 360 trades in commerce, but the secondhand business is not one of them. In recent years, the secondhand business in Shanghai has become very prosperous, and the profits are also quite high, because the buying and selling are very large, and outsiders do not even understand the details. Secondhand goods cannot be compared with formal commodity transactions, and the goods cannot be compared with the goods in formal stores, and the transactions are very different.</p>
<h3>Expansion of the Area</h3>
<p>Most of the people who operate are from the Su-Chang area. Along the streets and lanes, they carry empty baskets or buy and sell, or set up stalls to collect goods, or rent storefronts to open secondhand stores. The address in the British Concession is in Mantingfang and Hongmiao Lane. The French Concession's Pingjili Road has now expanded to Xiejiao and Ningbo Road after the war, and it has also become a secondhand market. Copper and tin utensils, ancient paintings, ancient bottles, clothes, shoes, bowls, and daily-use chairs, tables, benches, bowls, chopsticks, knives, forks, radios, phonographs, records, iron beds, etc. are all sold. But if you want to buy this kind of thing, you must be (very shrewd) and also know the goods and be able to bargain. Sometimes you can get valuable things at extremely low prices. If the buyer doesn't know the goods, it's better not to go there to get a bargain.</p>
<h3>Price Differences of Ten Times</h3>
<p>The goods on secondhand stalls cannot be compared with the items in stores. In order to maintain their reputation, the items in each store are consistent, and no one is cheated, whether old or young. If you believe it, you buy it and don't bargain, which shows that their brand is strong (general slippery shops are not included). However, doing business on secondhand stalls is not the same. For an ordinary item, if the asking price is 50 yuan and you offer 5 yuan, they will actually sell it to you. The difference between the asking price and the bargaining price is ten times, which is really unbelievable.</p>
<h3>The Allure of Secondhand Goods Over New</h3>
<p>Speaking of the items in secondhand shops, their displayed goods come from various sources. They are not wholesale from manufacturers, stores, or specialized dealers, nor do they require ordering and manufacturing. This is what distinguishes them from the goods in general stores.</p>
<p>Now, the prices of all kinds of goods are rising alarmingly. Ordinary families cannot afford new items, so many turn to secondhand stalls. This is because secondhand prices are much lower than new goods, and sometimes more durable. This is because new products have been made with tighter resources, and all the raw materials for manufacturing objects have been cut back, so that the quality of new products is inferior to that of old ones, and they are not as durable in use.</p>
<h3>Seekers in the Alleyways</h3>
<p>Since the end of the war, the secondhand business has become particularly prosperous, forming a special development in the industry. In every lane or alleyway, there are many people coming and going, collecting secondhand goods all day long. Coming and going, in each alleyway, there are more than a dozen people shouting all day long, "Are there any foreign bottles or Shen Bao newspapers to sell? Is there any secondhand goods to sell for money?" It can be seen that the profits from collecting secondhand goods are so high that people are envious, which is why so many people are doing this business.</p>
<h3>A Kind of Adorable Skill</h3>
<p>The secondhand business is indeed a business with huge profits. For example, if you have old things to sell to them, they are not worth three coppers, but they collect them and repair them to look like new. People who don't know the goods can't tell they are secondhand. They add several times or more than ten times the cost of collection and sell them, and someone buys them. This kind of skill is truly adorable. Sometimes they receive very valuable things, but the sellers don't know the goods, or they are stolen goods sold to them by thieves, then they will bargain even more fiercely. People who collect secondhand goods are most fortunate to encounter such customers. That is why many people who do the secondhand business get rich.</p>
<h3>Sharing Information Among Peers</h3>
<p>It is said that the secondhand business also has its experts, who are generally eloquent. When they come and go in the hall and receive secondhand goods, they resell them to experts. At the same time, they also contact various secondhand dealers to share information. For example, if you have several things to sell, the first secondhand collector comes to your door, looks at them, and offers a price. You think it is too cheap and don't sell it to him. But when the second secondhand collector comes, the price is not as high as the first one, because they have already shared information. If you still don't sell it to him, the third one will come and bargain even more fiercely. In short, the sharing of information among the secondhand dealers makes the prices offered by each secondhand collector for the things to be sold in a certain place similar. If you want to get a good price and live, then the fourth and fifth ones will not come to ask. This is also the help that they provide to each other for the common interests of their peers, which is worth praising.</p>
<h3>Detectives Snare Thieves, Display Stolen Goods, Hoping Owners Will Recognize Them</h3>
<p>Many detectives from the French police station investigated robbery cases within the boundary. Last night, they arrested Xu A Da, who had no profession and was twenty-two years old, on Eight Mile Bridge Street, Aiduya Road. Under interrogation at the police station, he confessed to having committed many robberies. As a result, a woman's watch was recovered from a pawnshop in Nanshi. Later, together with the Chinese police station, they arrested an accomplice, Yang Desheng, who specialized in selling the stolen goods for Xu A Da. The criminals will be charged with robbery and receiving stolen goods in the Second Special District Local Court. The French police station is continuing its investigation in order to find the owners who have not reported the loss and retrieve other stolen goods.</p>
<h3>Xinhua Spray Paint Factory Expands</h3>
<p>Xinhua Spray Paint Factory is organized by industrialists such as Kang Hou, Xu Guanqun, Xiang Kangyuan, Li Runtian, Li Jingdong, and Ba Zhuangzuoyun, specializing in the production of various paints, lacquers, and chemical industrial products. The products are of excellent quality and have a wide sales network. The factory building was built on Yanping Road with complete equipment and a large scale. This expansion and increase in capital was originally set at two million yuan, but due to enthusiastic subscriptions from all walks of life, it was closed at the end of last month, exceeding three million yuan. The factory authorities have decided to increase it to more than two million and five hundred thousand yuan, and all excess amounts will be refunded proportionally.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I have recently read the articles on dental hygiene in your newspaper and am very impressed. I have also studied this subject for many years and dare to offer a piece of my humble opinion to the readers: 1. Every morning when you get out of bed, sit cross-legged with your eyes closed and meditate (what Taoists call "calming the mind and regulating the breath"). Clench your fists and place them on your left and right knees, tighten your anus, and open your mouth forcefully to knock your teeth together as loudly as possible. Count to thirty-six, no more, no less. It is best to do this three times a day, morning, noon, and evening, without interruption. 2. When urinating or defecating, you must clench your teeth, close your upper and lower lips, and use your tongue to press against them inside. Do not relax until the urination or defecation has stopped. If you practice this for a long time, you will be able to strengthen your teeth. I would be grateful if you would publish this letter. Wang Ruting, October 6</p>

<h3>Third Handicap Basketball Tournament Ends, Tongren Wins Championship Again</h3>
<p>The third handicap basketball tournament, which lasted two months, concluded successfully yesterday. The final match was exciting. The championship battle between Tongren and Muir was expected to be won by Tongren, so Xuan Jiajiang generously offered a handicap of 15 points (in past battles, Tongren had always offered 10 points). As a result, Muir threatened throughout the match and tied the score at 40-40. Fortunately, the handicap regulations stipulate that in a tie game with no overtime, the team giving the handicap can claim victory. Tongren thus won the championship due to the convenience of this rule. At the end of the first half, Tongren had only recovered 2 points and was still behind 14-27. The score in the second half was even closer, eventually resulting in a tie. In other matches, Qunyi defeated Team S again 28-19, and Qianghua defeated Huanan 56-29. Qianghua, with two wins and one loss, came from behind.</p>

<h3>Public Bonds Are Actively Covering Shorts</h3>
<p>In the off-market trading of public bonds, prices soared due to short covering and retail purchases. Sellers were enthusiastic at the beginning of trading, but as the trend rose, they took back their offers, so the rise was even more intense. This situation seems to be approaching the highest price. Bingzhong's initial trading was 4 yuan and 8 jiao, gradually breaking through 5 yuan and 6 yuan, and even as high as 7 yuan. After a slight retreat of 2 jiao, it rose by a large 2 yuan and 5 jiao. Jiazhong was only 6 yuan and 2 jiao, 6 jiao less than Bingzhong, but it also rose by 1 yuan and 5 jiao. Yizhong was 1 yuan and 2 jiao less than Bingzhong, but it also rose by 2 yuan and 1 jiao. Ding was 3 yuan and 5 jiao, up 1 yuan and 9 jiao. Wuzhong was 4 yuan and 6 jiao, up 2 yuan and 6 jiao, which was the most. The situation seems to be turning better again. The volume of transactions was chaotic and unverifiable.</p>
<h3>The Cloth Market Has No Honor or Disgrace, Actual Sales Are Still Stagnant</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday, actual sales were still stagnant, and the market had no honor or disgrace. 16-pound Earth Coarse Cloth was 189 yuan, Flying Hong was 187.5 yuan, 20-pound New Character was 110 yuan and 5 jiao, 8-pound Zhenzhong was 107 yuan, 12-pound Earth Fine Cloth was 162 yuan, Dapeng New Single was 160 yuan, Fugui Factory Single was 155 yuan, Bank Single was 150 yuan, Chick Shelin was 243 yuan, Qin Meiren Yuan Cloth was 137 yuan, Meirenyu Yuan Twill was 137 yuan, and Three Sheep Serge Factory Single was 5 yuan and 8 jiao.

<p>East Cloth</p>
<p>Starting strong and ending weak, the result was slightly higher than the previous day, but the volume of transactions was extremely light. 12-pound Longtou Fine Cloth New Single was 169 yuan, Bank Single Longtou was 159 yuan and 5 jiao, and Caiqiu was 158 yuan and 5 jiao, up 5 jiao to 1 yuan. However, the prices of mid- and low-grade fine cloth were very flat and tired. Feiyu was 156 yuan and 5 jiao, Yanghe was 155 yuan, and Laba Tong was 153 yuan and 5 jiao, and there were still few buyers. Sijunzi Serge Hongdan opened at 6 yuan, 9 jiao and 4 fen, rose to 9 jiao and 8 fen, and then fell to 6 yuan, 9 jiao and 6 fen, which was an increase of 6 fen. The Bank Single was only 6 yuan, 7 jiao and 1 fen, a small drop of 2 fen.</p>
<h3>Gold Jewelry Prices Rise by 50 Yuan in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Gold Jewelry Industry Daxin Tonghang Jewelry Market, the listing price for each tael was still 2,350 yuan in the morning. At 1:00 PM, it rose by 50 yuan, totaling 2,400 yuan (the purchase price was less than 300 yuan). The inter-industry price was that a certain household absorbed 5 yuan higher in the morning, at 2,140 yuan. Russia was in the process of raising the price, and there was a commotion of 30 yuan. At noon, 2,170 yuan had buyers pushing the price up by 35 yuan. There were 30 yuan difference degrees of transaction. Transactions were clear and sparse. The listing price for each tael of silver jewelry was still 14 yuan. The inter-industry price was 13 yuan and 6 jiao and 8 fen.</p>
<h3>Military Ticket Purchase and Sale Prices Are Gradually Approaching</h3>
<p>The Japanese military ticket has turned firm. The inter-industry price is 5 yuan, 5 jiao and 5 fen.

<p>The actual sales of dried sweet potatoes are quite prosperous, and the market trend is easy to rise and difficult to stabilize. 50 bags of Qingdao dried sweet potatoes opened at 140 yuan, including the sacks. Yesterday, a truckload of Feizi cake new goods arrived, priced at 62 yuan and 6 jiao, which was the same as before.</p>
<h3>Commercial Briefs</h3>
<p>New Yuan Dates Arrive in Small Quantities and Rise Slightly Recently, some have been transported, but they are being hoarded due to the small quantity. The listed price has risen again by 40 to 50 yuan. Gaozhuang has reached 600 yuan, and the Tianjin regulations are second, ranging from 550 to 560 yuan. The production price is also tight. According to Nanjing News, it has risen by 50 yards in recent days.</p>
<p>Medium-Sized Dried Scallops Continue to Rise</p>
<p>Due to the scarcity of both arrivals and stocks, the market for medium-sized dried scallops continues to rise. The listed price has risen to 4,700 yuan. Ordinary goods are sold for 4,300 to 4,400 yuan, with delivery up to 4,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Listening to Opera Also Requires a Certain Level</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>Singing opera is difficult, and listening to opera is also difficult. Singing opera requires a certain level, and listening to opera also requires a certain level. Why do I say this? If you go to listen to opera, you should understand a little bit to appreciate it. If you don't understand opera but insist on going to listen, no one has the right to stop or prohibit you. But since you don't understand opera, you should sit quietly and respectfully under the stage and watch attentively. But there are people who don't understand opera but insist on expressing their opinions under the stage. If they don't want to listen or watch, they hiss or applaud to order the actors off the stage. If they like to watch beautiful faces, they grin and can't wait to swallow them in one gulp. In this situation, I can only cry bitterly and sigh deeply. Why do I express this feeling? Because I saw Huangjin and Wu Suqiu performing "Spinning Cotton." Before that, Ye Shengzhang's "An Tian Hui" had the usual monkey fight. The Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li Jing sat on a high platform and sang a section of Kunqu Opera (a set of "Dian Yichun Hun Jianglong"). This was done to have both civil and martial arts, both fighting and singing. This style was the creation of Yuan opera. Plays such as "Liu Yi Chuanshu," "Ge Jiangmen Zhi," and other dramas are all like this, with fighting and singing interspersed. Half of it is for the martial arts actors to rest, and half of it is to allow people to listen while sitting on the high platform and watching the battle, appreciating the beauty of the singing and the excellence of the performance. Therefore, later generations followed this example. For example, in "Changbanpo," Cao Cao sang a section on the mountain after each of Zhao Yun's fights. This is also the intention. Now, because everyone is eager to see Wu Suqiu's "Spinning Cotton," they can barely tolerate the hot monkey fight. Now, listening to the Heavenly King singing endlessly, and singing Kunqu Opera that they don't understand at all, they can't help but applaud to express their unwillingness to listen anymore. The ignorant people rise up to echo them and hiss, presenting a burst of chaos. Judging from this, they are simply ignorant troublemakers. They not only reveal that their level of listening to opera is not enough, but also expose the excessive lust of these people. This is a disgrace to the world of opera appreciation. I hope people will correct their mistakes if they have them, and encourage themselves if they don't.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Art Theater Launches First Bomb After Autumn Cool, Zuo Lin Directs "Shanghai Circus"</h3>
<p>— Yixiang</p>
<p>The Shanghai Art Theater has been established for about ten months. In this not-so-long period, many plays have been performed, such as "Yang Guifei," "Hero of the Desert Island," "Second Dream," and "Four Sisters." All walks of life admire their hard work very much. They rested for two months this summer, and now they are going to start a large-scale long-term performance. The first program scheduled is "Shanghai Circus," written by Shi Tuo and directed by Zuo Lin.</p>
<p>During the two months of rest, the Shanghai Art Theater actively expanded the strength of the theater troupe. In addition to its original actors such as Zhi Qiaoqi, Sima Yingcai, Lu Shanmei, Zhen, etc., a large number of new forces joined. These newly joined actors are the ones that the audience has long hoped to see on stage, such as Shi Hui, Ying Zi, Shen Min, Shi Yuan, Zhang Fa, etc. At the same time, the directing aspect is also in charge of Fei Mu, Zuo Lin, Gu Zhongyi, etc. It is almost a concentration of the elite of the Shanghai theater scene, preparing for a large-scale performance. The name of this play is "The Big Circus," but it is actually an excellent drama. Don't misunderstand that the real circus is really horses and real monkeys on stage. Maybe you can see these gimmicks, but this is just to give everyone a new feeling.</p>
<h3>Bo'ai Holds Charity Screening, Proceeds from Seat Sales Donated to Charity</h3>
<p>— Lilai</p>
<p>"Bo'ai" is a blockbuster film co-directed by all directors of the China Federation and performed by all actors. The China Federation has seventeen directors, seventy-four actresses, two hundred and two actors, plus more than two hundred staff and carpenters. It is estimated that more than five hundred people participated in the work of "Bo'ai." The filming schedule for "Bo'ai" was limited to seven days, so each director was divided into day and night groups for continuous shooting. The front of the lilac garden was almost a bicycle race meeting. The scene of the collective gathering of all the movie stars was shot for three consecutive nights. Gong Qiuxia, Zheng Zhong, Xu Xinyuan, Gong Jianong, and Qin Tongyi all fell ill. The parts directed by Zhu Shilin, Li Pingqian, and Fang Peilin were profound. Fortunately, the audience paid attention to it. "Bo'ai" will be screened at five Western film theaters on Double Tenth Festival, surpassing the four theaters of "Allure and Overthrow of the City" Xi Shi's tour screening. At 2:30 PM on the 9th, the China Federation will hold a charity screening at the Great Light Electric Theater, and all proceeds from the seat sales will be donated to various charitable organizations. This is also a small way to fulfill the meaning of "Bo'ai."</p>
<h3>Storytellers Skilled in "Three Smiles" (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Jianfan</p>
<p>Xia Hesheng's art came from Qian Youqing. Before Youqing's death, he also studied "Three Smiles" from Xie Pinquan. Therefore, Hesheng, in addition to telling "Depicting the Golden Phoenix" and "Double Golden Ingots," is also skilled in "Three Smiles." Although it is not as detailed as "Depicting," the romantic and refined style of the male and female characters in the book is wonderfully expressed. In recent years, the storytelling of "Depicting the Plains" has become more and more sophisticated, gradually shedding its hot temper.</p>
<p>Among the female storytellers, Xu Xueyue can be regarded as an all-rounder. Her portrayal of the carefree and witty Zhu Zhishan in "Three Smiles" is vivid and expressive. The roles of Tang Yin and Qiu Xiang are portrayed with elegance and grace, perfectly fitting their identities. She also adds many unique poems, lyrics, and couplets from the hands of famous scholars to the middle part of the book. After leaving her teacher, she is self-sufficient and her reputation is not easy to achieve.</p>
<p>Jiang Ruting is famous in the art world for his two ballad stories, "Falling Golden Fan" and "Double Golden Ingots." Although "Three Smiles" is not his specialty, the descriptions of the ugly and colorful characters in the book are hilarious, and his storytelling is thought-provoking and full of fun. In the past, he performed with Tang Zhuping, and now he collaborates with Zhu Jiesheng, both of whom are popular with the audience.</p>
<p>Jiang Dingchu's "Three Smiles," passed down from the Wang Shaoquan school, is the most regular. His singing is accurate, clear, and pleasant to hear. His storytelling is methodical and meticulous. It is a pity that he lacks gimmicks, so it feels bland and tasteless. Since Wang Wanxiang broke up the partnership, his apprentice Cheng Siyin has filled in as his assistant. As for where Luo Binzhi is, I don't know. He hasn't come to Shanghai for a long time.</p>
<p>Xu Yunzhi, with his unique singing style, is a disciple of Xia Liansheng. However, his storytelling style is completely different from that of his master. His storytelling is slightly superficial, and he feels comfortable playing the male and female characters, but the role of Zhu Zhishan is inferior. He has many disciples of the Ting generation, but only Yan Xueting has inherited his mantle. Since Xueting changed to telling "Yang Naiwu," he has gained a good reputation, and the opportunity to tell "Three Smiles" is getting less and less.</p>
<p>Liu Tianyun, who started performing on stage with his teacher at the age of ten under the stage name of "Child Art," is also a disciple of Xia Liansheng. In the early days, he partnered with Wang Siquan, and his storytelling was very skilled. Although "Three Smiles" does not have great scenes such as "Robbing the Execution Ground" or "Opening the Camp Gate," it is unique in the many talented scholars and beautiful ladies. His storytelling is full of bookishness. Tianyun has a very good stage presence, and his words and expressions are very witty. His disciple Xie Yujing is also very talented.</p>
<h3>After Listening to "Battle of Taiping"</h3>
<p>— Qi</p>
<p>The singing and acting in the play "Battle of Taiping" is even more complex than "Mount Dingjun." It was one of the famous plays that Mr. Tan (Xinpei) relied on back then. Wearing a purple-gold helmet that covers the forehead, one cannot even think of singing it without a good voice. Even with a good voice, it is still not enough without a tragic and impassioned spirit. Moreover, it's not just this one line; the entire play must be consistent and meticulous. This play is as demanding in Peking Opera as "Farewell Mother in the Chaotic Arrows" is in Kunqu Opera. We younger generations deeply regret not being able to hear Old Tan (Xinpei) in person. We can only satisfy ourselves by listening to the records of Mr. Tan and Little Yu (Shuyan). However, it is rare to find a satisfactory performance by rising Laosheng (old male roles) on stage. When Tan Fuying, Li Shaochun, and others came south last time, they performed this play, but although it was somewhat acceptable, it still lacked the proper flavor. Unexpectedly, Chen Dahuo, who came from the amateur world, achieved unexpected success in his performance at the Tianchan Theater this time. Closing my eyes and listening quietly, it was as if Shu Yan (Tan Xinpei) had returned to the stage. Both performances were sold out, showing the strong appeal of this play. The situation is similar to how Tan Fuying's "Mount Dingjun" and Yu Zhenfei's "Selling Horses" always sell out. If Dahuo can make this play his signature performance in the future, he can be sure of success. He has become an instant hit.</p>
<h3>Theatrical World News</h3>
<p>— Yi Qing</p>
<p>Lu Luming's performance in "The Young Mistress's Fan" at the Lyceum Theatre was quite successful. It has now been decided to continue the contract for half a month. Starting from Double Ten Day (October 10th), she will present the monumental tragedy "Return," still co-starring Lu Luming and Chen Zhengdian. Tragedies are more popular than comedies. It is expected that Lu Luming's continued success will exceed that of "The Young Mistress's Fan."</p>
<p>The Shanghai Film Actor Traveling Troupe organized by He Bin and Han Fei is ready. He and Han left by train the day before yesterday to Tianjin to make preliminary arrangements. All the actors, including Sun Zhijun, Mao Yanhua, Deng Xumei, and Cun Linzhen, etc., are scheduled to depart today. In addition, Shangguan Yunzhu has also been invited to join, so Shangguan has been preparing her luggage these days. Her departure from Shanghai will be in the next day or two.</p>
<p>Funds have been remitted from Tianjin, and Tang Huaiqiu plans to lead the China Travel Troupe actors north around the 17th of this month.</p>
<p>The Art Federation has abandoned its plan to publicly perform "Sunrise" and is actively rushing to rehearse the new play "A Moment's Mistake Becomes Eternal Regret."</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Harmonica Association is celebrating its fifth anniversary. To benefit harmonica enthusiasts, it has established a free quota in the association's Morning Bell Team. Anyone with advanced skills and aspirations for research can register at the association before Double Ten Day. Address: Zhonghe Building, Nanjing Road, Shanxi Road.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(10) Flying Peak</p>
<p>Aying sent the lighter into the inner room to light the lamp for Little Zhuge. After a while, Aying returned first and smiled, "As I guessed, the iron hooks on the two back windows were not fastened. The wind opened them last night because of the northwest wind. It was the same last night. Hushan put on his undershirt and trousers and got out of bed to close the window. I was worried he would catch a cold." Wei Shaoyun asked, "What are they doing now?" Aying said, "They are coughing. Little Zhuge coughed first, and then the others followed." Wei Shaoyun said, "What's that? What about Cui Zhen?" Aying said, "Cui Zhen is lying in bed. Little Zhuge, that short-lived Little Zhuge, he's like a magician, not letting me watch, afraid that if I watch, the magic won't work." Wei Shaoyun smiled and said, "Probably there's no change, right?" Aying snorted through her nose and said, "A change of heart? If there's a change of heart, just listen to what Little Zhuge says. He swindled our wine, starting to eat from eight o'clock, wanting to eat until twelve o'clock. It's not so easy to let them off the hook. If my younger brother agrees, I won't." Wei Shaoyun was stunned and said, "Don't make a sound. Who's talking again?" Aying strained her ears to listen. It was Little Zhuge's voice, but she couldn't make out what he was saying.</p>
<p>After another moment of silence, Wei Shaoyun automatically picked up the wine bottle and poured a large half-cup of wine into a white porcelain cup. He raised the wine cup, tilted his head back, and drank. The wine in the cup was not finished, and some of it dripped down his chin and onto his neck. He pulled out a square handkerchief and wiped himself without thinking. He laughed and said, "Whatever Little Zhuge is up to, I don't care. I'm going to go in." Then he heard a burst of laughter from inside, followed by a jumble of footsteps approaching from afar. Wei Shaoyun faced the door leading to the inner room, which he had only seen once a year. Sheng Hushan was the first to walk out, bowing to Wei Shaoyun and saying, "Shaoyun, please come in. Little Zhuge is really capable!" Before he finished speaking, Little Zhuge, Niupi A, Shou Tou You Laoshu, and Ge Liu stumbled out from the doorway one by one. As soon as Little Zhuge came out, Sheng Hushan lost his right to speak, and Little Zhuge reported, "Young Master Wei, everything is going smoothly. I only used my three-inch unrotting tongue to talk to Miss Bian, making her as docile as a little lamb. Now you go in and see her. She, she, she is waiting for your honorable presence." Little Zhuge pointed his finger inward as he said "she." (196)</p>
