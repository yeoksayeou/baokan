<p>小引</p>
<p>南海戰雲，延及印度洋之後，天竺一隅，乃成爲舉世注目之焦點，良以印度前途如何，不僅關乎太平洋大戰得失，亦且爲世界大局動靜所繫。日來英印談判，旣成僵局，此後若何開展抑或長此遷延，別有演變，均待未來事實之答復。顧印度內部群情，外間向鮮注意，以是對於現况瞭解，難免隔膜，爰取有關印度種種之爲世人所亟欲洞悉者，諸如地理，種族歷史，政制，宗敎，文化諸大端，分篇殫述，彙爲專輯，按日刊布，倘亦關心世變者所樂睹歟？</p>
<p>一從地理上說起</p>
<p>翻開世界地圖，西部給南北美洲佔據着大部份土地，隔開大西洋，北面是兵戈擾攘的歐洲，南部是廣大的阿非利加洲。自非洲再往東部轉過來，就可以見到最大的印度半島。半島的右面是孟加拉灣，左面是阿刺伯海，和紅海相接。自蘇伊士運河開　後，歐洲就獲得一最近的途徑，載運香料與絲回去，不必再繞道好望角，曠時日久地來到東方。錫蘭島是印度半島的前哨，雄踞在印度洋中。</p>
<p>印度邊境，有高山作爲屛障。西北部的蘇里曼山脈把印度和阿富汗隔開，北部是世界最髙山脈喜馬拉雅山，使印度和中國的西藏分爲二部，東部羣山成爲緬甸與印度的天然分界錢。地理學者通常把印度分成三部：第一是偉大的山脈，拱衛在印度的邊境；第二是廣澳的北部平原，或稱印度恒河流域平原，這是由印度三條主要的河流——印度河，恒河，布拉馬普特拉河——及其支流的流域所形成；第三是印度高原，就是南部的半島部份，由東西高止山脈的對峙，而成爲德在高原。此外，恒河和印度流域之間，有塔爾沙漠，雨量稀少。</p>
<p>印度的海岸極少深的海灣和港口。如其人民生長在北夏華，那哥不爾，或印度的心臟新德里等地方的，離海岸很遠，簡直不知道海是怎樣的遼闊。因爲海岸綫整齊，所以絕少可以利用作為港口。孟買算是優良的自然港口，印度東部的加爾各答，雖然也是港口，但位處恒河的三角洲上，並非臨海的。東部海岸沒有西部這揉多岩石，海水沿岸多沙洲，大輪船因爲水淺不能靠岸，而且暗礁衆多，小船駛行，亦很危險。郵船能直接駛抵碼頭的只有微紮加帕坦和麻德拉斯，二地都是利用人工建築深水碼頭，使船舶可以止碇。</p>
<p>印度北部共有三條主要河流，已如上述。三條河流的起源都在北部邊境的山谷中。山上終年積雪，氣候寒冷。溶雪都緩緩流入河道，還有山洪的冲瀉，所以河流湍急奔騰，一直流入北部平原，才是波平如鏡，時時因爲地勢平坦，河流放棄原有河床，另覓新道。在半島部份的河流和平原上的不同，向東流的主要河流如忠哈那地河，哥達維利河，向西流的如納巴達河，泰普梯河等，都發源於髙原，水量主要是由雨季時的陣雨所積聚而流下，不是雨季時河水極淺，只能駛行極小的小船。印度髙原的斜坡由西朝東，所以雨水即自西高止山脈東流，注入孟加拉灣</p>
<p>因爲地位處於熱帶，印度的氣溫很髙，極少變化。尤其是中部平原，炎熱異常，疫癘盛行。喜馬拉雅山地緯度較北，比較溫和，夏季多有到那裹去避暑的。德干高原因爲地形較髙，比北部平原反來得凉爽。印度河下流雨量極少，田地需要人工灌漑。印度北部平原如判遮普，合衆部，信德給是苦旱，就需要運河的水量，灌漑田畝。</p>
<p>農業是印度主耍的生產，印度全人口十分之七大都是農民。主耍產品有米棉，茶，黃麻，甘蔗等品。恒河下流因田地肥沃，產米極富。印度河下游和德干高原中部產棉，產量居世界第二位，英國棉織品的原料都在此取給。茶除錫蘭產量極豐外，阿薩密，孟加拉等地，均由中國移植茶種，傾銷歐美市塲。黃麻是印度主要輸出品，產地與茶同。其他雅片，橡皮，咖啡亦有出產。與農業相關的　牧方面，運輸笨重木材等，有龐大無比的象隊。耕種與拖拉車輛，牛爲第一。印度每二人可以享用一頭牛，產牛量居世界第一位。礦產方面多煤，石油，錳，金，寳石等。煤產於孟加拉西部，石油產於判遮普，阿薩密，錳產麻得拉斯和孟買，產量居世界第一位。金礦在買索爾和海得拉巴，寳石自古爲有名產地，近雲南邊界一帶更多。印度富源遍地，物產豐盛，英國的經濟資源，大部分都取給於此。所以對於今日的印度問題，英國必須有自知之明，局勢已到緊要關頭，必須互相瞭解，前途才有希望。</p>
<p>在政治上而言，印度共分二部，英屬印度由印度政府統治，印度政府設總督一人，主持全印政務；另外則是印度諸部，各由當地王公管理一切。首都原設加爾各答，一九一二年後，改設新德里。印度幅員遼闊，英屬印度政府劃分全印爲十一大省，六小省。印度諸部受王公統治，印度政府特任命政治顧問一人，幫同治理政務。有的部落區城極大，如海得拉巴，買索爾等，直接與政府發生聯繫，有的小至幾方里，即與境內的省公署保持聯絡。國內婆羅門敎，回敎，佛敎流行均盛。婆羅門敎耶印度敎，信徒衆多，分僧侶，士族，平民，勞働者，奴隸等五種階級，界限森嚴。回敎盛行於俾路支，佛敎起源印度，印人信奉的較少，緬甸和泰國奉行者多，是世界二大佛敎國。此外尙有信基督敎，錫克敎，猶太敎，拜火敎的，各立門戶，有時甚至發生衝突。</p>
<p>印度人口，大約有三萬四千萬人。（340，000，000）人口密度，並不平均，有的部份極少，有的城市人口密集。大致以住在平原或較高的山區，冲積土，或經過人力墾殖的土地上者居多。語言多至百十餘種，最通行的是西印度語和孟加拉語。</p>
<p>首都新德里，地勢衝要，居北部平原的心臟，爲全國第六最大城市，鐵路四通，工商極盛，四周土地因爲灌溉得宜，產棉豐富，即運到新德里的工廠中紡織。建築美麗，尤其是總督府的雄偉富麗，世界罕有。</p>
<p>加爾各答當印度平原的門戶，可稱印度的「商業首都」，大商船可以自由進出恒河流域豐富的農產物都在此出口。鐵路由此橫貫印度以抵孟買，或至麻得拉斯，南印度諸城，或恒河流域去。有宏大的大學，公園，植物園，博物館等，號稱印度的倫敦。</p>
<p>孟買是印度第二大城，人口在百萬以上，港灣深廣，停泊安全，是印度最優良的商港。孟買市建在對岸小島上，和新加坡形勢相仿。孟買後面的髙原上產棉極豐，原料採集後送到孟買市上的棉織廠中紡織，所以孟貿的紡織業是亞洲首屈。市街整潔，寺院建築宏偉，且有完善的船渠倉庫，略帶歐美景色。</p>
<p>麻得拉斯爲印度第三大城，人口約有五十萬。主要輸出物爲皮革，主要的工業就是硝皮。此地沿岸本來很平直，不能算作良港，自英人努力經營後，築防波堤，設棧橋，浚海底，才可停泊大輪，有今日這樣興盛。可見人羣的努力，足以改造自然的缺陷。</p>

<p>淸涼國師說、若將心比佛、與佛始終同、始終兩端是同、惟中間不同、欲究中間不同之故、應究人之來源、儒家道家謂人秉天地中和、由無極生太極、太極生兩儀、演而爲天地人三才、佛教則以人與天地、皆阿賴耶相所分攝、唯識論謂一切惟心造、足徵事物均屬虛空、人之最先木極光明、生於光音天中、名爲天人、法身遍滿法界、其時大地平坦如掌、人可飛行翱翔、本與佛同、祇因一念妄動、遂生三粗六細之相、山大　地、貪嬉遊、貪地餅、禍從口人、貪食地餅後、靈性消滅、去佛日遠、遂成地面人、在此時以光、一念未動、靈光充沛、故謂與佛始同也、一念已動、貪心執浩、乃生苦果、起信論云、動則有苦、果不離因、因貪心日熾、恣意物質之樂、人類生齒日繁、物質有限、貪之不已、即感不足、不足即爭、爭則怒鬥斫殺、陷整個世界於動盪殘害恐怖中、此皆由貪　癡念將靈性汨沒所致、家師說明心見性、人心不明、由三毒所迷、而生八萬四千煩惱如將此煩惱層層剝盡、本眞現而心地明、當可重還佛地、即與佛終同之意也、然究如何以剝盡煩惱、惟有受　　五戒、</p>
<p>戒殺</p>
<p>持戒之首、在不殺生、惻隱之心、人皆有之、如見猪肉、撐肥擇瘦以圖一　、如易以人肉、莫不駭怪却走其實猪與人爲肉則　也、不過以食猪肉爲習慣、不覺其忍耳、吾人不殺、要不殺動物及切有情之物、也莫忽略無形之殺、欲知世上刀兵苦、但聽屠門半夜聲、所謂殺聲、豈止屠門、所謂殺時、豈止半夜、人之捉　撲　　臭蟲、均是殺也、此乃有形之殺、若人蔽於三毒而致殺盜邪淫、何嘗而非自殺、其法身　命、被迷執不斗、人能明此、即應去　毒、三毒而心自明、惡已去而善亦無、善乃惡之對等名詞、根本無善、惡於何有、　祖要達摩祖師安心、及覓心了不可得、乃悟無心之理、須知無心即明、有終不明、遂致不平、如說教者調有所說法即是　佛、因有即不明故、六祖偈云、木來無物、即謂無心也、談到明心見性、無論任何宗敎、祇求　澈、即可做到、佛敎理教係引各敎而做到、澈底境地、如耶穌之博愛、祇以人類爲木位、未免狹隘、即人類亦有黃白之爭、紅黑之歧、仍未平等、父如何敎戒殺猪仔、則殺牛羊、殺時喃喃有詞、謂大不生、地不長、人不吃、我不殺、諉過於人、仍不澈底、佛敎不然、對動物及有情各物　例平等、一切博愛、如此心自明而性自現、學佛之人、尤共學　嚴之人視一切平等、無厚薄親疏之區分、我今所供養、在從小處做起、日積月累、自　泯、切一毒惡業、最後還我本眞、明心見性、我與佛終儲相同矣、</p>

<p>戰前，即使是一夫一妻的小家庭，僱佣一個娘姨，也不能目爲浪費的；如果每月有百元以卜的固定收人，在第一個孩子參加這家庭集團時，或許還要另僱一個奶媽哩。所以，附近滬寗滬杭兩鐵路的農家，寗可把家鄕的田地托人代種，而到上海來「坐薦頭」的。兩和界以及南市閘北的　頭店就多至五百餓家。</p>
<p>現什衣食任行，比從前增加十倍至五十倍不等，而一個安份守己的薪水階級，能有五倍於昔日的收人的已屬一天之驕子」了，「娘姨」自然也成爲「問題」之。說起娘姨的工資，雖然尙徘徊在十元大關左右，與戰前比較。亦僅及五倍之數。（奶媽工資在五十元左右，亦爲五倍）這每天三角三分的工資，在一個家庭的支出表上，好像是微小得很，但飯食的供給，就使人頭痛了；少算算，一個娘姨的食米，至少要一百元。</p>
<p>有人說過：娘姨實在用不起，但爲了軋米，似乎又不得不佣；然而每天軋來的一升米，十分之八要裝入她的肚皮，兩難，兩難！</p>
<p>一個月前，在我家附近的近十家薦頭店中，娘姨大姐坐得滿坑滿谷；最近，老闆娘又在店堂里作方城之戰了。這些待價而沽的娘姨大姐到那里去了呢？老　娘是搖搖頭，表示她們這行業已經沒有發展的餘地了。據說：專工「一技之長」的娘姨，現在還有出路，譬如能够侍候奶奶太太的；專燙洋服的；燒得一手好菜的；……自有大公館里要用。所謂「奴撲如雲」，這些大公館的「排塲」是今過於昔的。</p>
<p>普通的一般娘姨，叫做「粗做」。「粗做」者，樣樣來得，却樣樣不精，昔日的小家庭，是需要這種一脚踢」的娘姨的，現在，少爺奶奶們都自己兼職了。因之，「一脚踢一的娘姨們，也「一脚」「踢」回家鄕去了。</p>
<p>於薦頭店方面僱佣一個娘姨的手續，最近的變遷；也可一叙。</p>
<p>從前，送娘姨來的時候，給「送力」銅元十枚，已鏗是很客氣的了。現在，出手四毛錢，雖不會嫌少，也不够「光燙」。三天「打樣」期滿，　頭店來「稱工錢」了。他們的介紹費是：照工資大小，東家是每元二角，稱爲「上手錢」；娘姨是每元一角，稱爲「下手錢」。譬如工資三元，東家給予六角，娘姨給予三角。此外，另加「保單」二角。現在「上手錢」是每元八角，「下手錢」爲每元三角，「保單」大洋一元正。</p>
<p>最近，常常有同居人家的娘姨介紹她們的同鄉人，工資也比較便宜，又可省去將近一個月工資的上手錢」，甚至是祗求吃飯，不求工資，這似乎是「娘姨大廉價」了。不過，一個家庭的僱佣娘姨與否，決不在這幾塊錢的出入上，最大的問題，還在米糧太貴，而又何處軋米！</p>
<p>同時，出賣氣力而至於「大廉價」，也自有其苦衷在。娘姨不是固本肥皂沒有脫手的時候，也是每天要吃飯的。一日以兩餐計，至少總得五塊錢吧？那末，「坐」一星期「薦頭」即還不能「落人家」，就是三個月白做了。夜里還得睡覺，那是住在薦頭店里，據說每夜也要納費五角。所以，與其今天望明天，明天再望明天，不如以每天的「生活費」作爲川資，歸鄕去也！」（蘋）</p>

<h3 id="c76">台詞擁堵的研究 <a href="#c76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— 陶順聖</p>
<p>在春假裏，旣不能像往日那樣遊山玩水，與其悶在家裏亂翻書，不如看一二齣話劇來得有意思。最近上海的話劇似乎比較有發展，新的劇本固然還不多見，可是新的演員却進來了不少，看完了幾齣春假中的名劇，我意想對於一般演員的念台詞，說幾句隨便的話了。當然，這些話對於著名的大演員們，是不値一讀的吧？</p>
<p>當演員在舞臺的時候，他（或她）若是耍把劇本的中心思想和情節傳達給觀衆，除了表演以外，就得藉他的台詞的背誦了。誦讀台詞應當是一步要緊的工作，可是有些演員却不能做得好。這或許是他們對於聲音和字音還缺少一點注意和訓練，以致有時字音之尖團不分，聲音長短，髙低，輕重，大小，分配得不很自然，破壊台詞的美麗，戲劇的演出。</p>
<p>聲音的不準確，可是有三種原因：</p>
<p>習慣——各地方有各地方的土音，習慣了以後，爲發出土音便利起見，聲音器官往往成了一種特殊的形式，以致阻礙準確的發聲。——這祇要把聲音器官的位置，設法練習糾正過來，就不難了。譬如硬說國語，在舞臺上是欠美的。</p>
<p>生理——牙齒漏風，倒還易於補救，舌短舌厚，聲帶不靈等現象，就比較困難了。</p>
<p>心理——演員上塲後，臨時發生意外，以致心慌意亂，發聲錯誤——這是可以原諒的，然而演員自己和舞裏監督最好能事前加以注意。</p>
<p>至於字音的分辨，除非演員天生生理上實在有缺陷，不然總是容易的。對詞時導演若能稍加指導，當有很大的效果</p>
<p>總之，演員平時得努力訓練自己的聲音聲調，研究字音的讀法，並虛心地接受人家的意見。經騐資質和知識程度情緒等，也都是決定讀音詞的條件。有了藝術化的聲音，然後才能把台詞靈活地背誦出來。</p>
<p>當然一個天才的演員，並不單靠他的聲音，單靠誦讀台詞，而是靠他各方面的成就，和不斷地努力。</p>

<p>— 新影</p>
<p>賈克古柏在好萊塢，會以童星而聞名於整個世界。他在賈克哥根以後，米蓋羅納之前，一度被推爲好萊塢唯一的童星當初他的聞名，的確不在　克哥根和米蓋羅納等一般人之下·六七年前，說起了賈克古柏這個名字，怕每一個影迷都知道的。衹是近年來他的年畫　長，一瞬間已失去了　星的資格，所以在銀幕上面，而今我們也不大再看見他了，反而有些生疏的樣子。</p>
<p>我們回想起來，肥得七八年前，設起了童星，就立刻會聯想到賈克古柏，而那時一般愛看童星片的影迷，就老是要看賈克古柏主演的影片。那個時期，賈克古柏主演的影片，的確不少，尤其可指出的，如「離婚後的兒子」，「金銀島」等，直到現在，還使我們留有深刻的印象呢。</p>
<p>時光是過得那麽的快，何况童星的時年本很短促的，一瞬間而今的賈克古柏早已成人長大，是二十多歲靑年了。美國加入戰局後，就廣徵入伍士兵，好萊塢的男明星，自亦不致例外，所以三五月來，電影明星的被徵入伍者，爲數已是不少。而據好萊塢五日的電報，賈克古柏最近也已接到上峯命令，召其入伍，當二等兵了。從此賈克古柏將完全脫離電影界，而去度軍事生活了，這又豈是　般影迷意料所及的啊</p>

<p>Philippine Japanese Army Base, 14th (Domei News Agency) - A large squadron of Japanese Navy and Army aircraft continued to fiercely bomb the Corregidor Island fortress in Manila Bay yesterday. It is reported that the northern artillery positions there have been almost completely destroyed.</p>
<p>Washington, 14th (Reuters) - According to an announcement by the War Department yesterday morning, the Corregidor Island fortress was bombed by Japanese aircraft ten times in the past twenty-four hours. Communication between Cebu and the island has been cut off, so the situation on Cebu Island is unknown. Japanese artillery units in Manila Bay are also continuously bombarding our artillery positions.</p>
<p>Washington, 14th (Reuters) - A spokesman for the U.S. War Department, when discussing the situation in Corregidor, stated that Japanese artillery units, based on the nearby Bataan Peninsula, have been continuously bombarding the defending forces in the past twenty-four hours. Although there is currently no problem with food supplies, it is feared that it will be difficult to sustain as all supply and reinforcement routes have been cut off. Within the besieged position, there are still many women, children, and civilians who have retreated from Manila, Cavite, and other places.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Domei News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:10 PM today that since the Japanese army launched a general offensive against the besieged Filipino and American troops on the Bataan Peninsula, up to Sunday, a total of 40,000 prisoners of war have been captured, including 15 generals and 6,700 American soldiers. Among the captured officers are Major General King, commander of the U.S. forces on the Bataan Peninsula, Major General Jones, commander of the First Corps, Major General Parker, commander of the Second Corps, and Major General Francisco, commander of the Philippine forces. During the same period, the Japanese army seized war trophies including 196 artillery pieces, 320 machine guns, 500 automatic rifles, 10,000 rifles, 124 tanks and armored vehicles, 220 automobiles, and a large quantity of other weapons and ammunition.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 14th (Haitong News Agency) - According to news from Washington, the U.S. War Department released a statement last night stating that communication between the U.S. and Corregidor Island in Manila has been completely cut off. Therefore, Washington has not received any recent reports on the Philippine war. There is also no news on the casualties and number of prisoners of war in the Bataan Peninsula campaign. Washington hopes to release news about the American forces on the Bataan Peninsula and Corregidor soon, as the American forces there numbered 50,000 when the Japanese army began its offensive eight days ago.</p>

<p>Officials announced that the evacuation of residents from the city of Madras began on the 7th of this month. To date, 130,000 people have left the city, with special trains carrying residents to the interior every day.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Domei News Agency) - The British Indian military authorities, due to increasing activity by the Japanese Navy in Bengal, are taking various emergency precautionary measures. According to a Reuters dispatch from Madras, all hotels and food stores in Madras Province have been taken over by the provincial government. Women have also been concentrated in military camps, with security forces patrolling everywhere. After seven days, the number of citizens who have fled from Madras to the interior has reached 230,000. The population of Madras has now decreased to 600,000. Moreover, the scope of emergency measures is not limited to the Madras urban area but even includes coastal cities as far northeast as Orissa.</p>

<p>Berlin, 14th (Havas News Agency) - A local radio station recently announced that although Malta is under intense attack by Axis forces, the British forces are still able to resist for a long time. The main reason is that the island's coastal artillery positions are protected by rocks, making them easy to defend. At the same time, there is no rear flank to attack Malta. The Axis forces can only directly attack from the sea or air. Therefore, the battle of Malta cannot be compared to the rapid conquest of Hong Kong and Singapore. However, Malta is no longer in an important position. All attempts to supply the island have failed, and the island has lost its role as a protector of British Mediterranean sea lanes.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Situation of Naval Battle in the Indian Ocean <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>A Certain Japanese Warship, 14th (Domei News Agency) - A certain Japanese naval commander revealed today that the warships and aircraft under his command sank 21 British transport ships, totaling 140,000 tons, in the Indian Ocean on April 6th in less than an hour. The details are as follows: On the morning of April 6th, the troops under his command advanced in formation. At 9:30 AM, they saw black smoke rising on the northwestern horizon, gradually approaching. Ship masts and smokestacks could already be seen. The distance between the two sides was about eight miles, so they changed course to head towards them. This was a large squadron of enemy merchant ships. At that time, the Japanese warships were approaching the Indian coast, and the coastal mountains and fortresses could already be seen. The merchant ships either mistook the Japanese warships for friendly ships or never turned back, continuing to sail towards the Japanese warships. It was then possible to identify that several of the enemy merchant ships were 10,000 tons, and the rest ranged from 5,000 to 8,000 tons. They seemed to be sailing from Calcutta to Ceylon. As the ships approached closer, it was possible to see that the enemy ships were equipped with eight-inch guns, but there were no gunners operating them at the time. The Japanese warships were ordered to open fire. The first salvo of shells immediately threw the enemy ships into chaos. The enemy cannons did not aim and fired randomly. The battle began at 10:00 AM and ended at 11:00 AM. Fifteen enemy transport ships were sunk, and another six were sunk by Japanese naval aircraft while escaping towards the coast.</p>

<p>New York, 14th (Reuters) - According to a New York Times dispatch from Bern, it is rumored that Germany has sent a strongly worded note to the Vichy government, setting a deadline of April 16th, demanding that Vichy clearly demonstrate an attitude of complete cooperation with Germany.</p>
<p>Geneva, 14th (Havas News Agency) - According to a dispatch from the Havas World Telegraph diplomatic correspondent, after former French Prime Minister Laval was received again by Marshal Pétain today, there is talk of another reorganization of the French cabinet. This is not surprising to those familiar with the inside story. According to reports, Laval's previous discussions with Marshal Pétain began on the 26th of last month and ended on the 2nd of this month. Today's discussions are the beginning of the second phase, the theme of which seems to be related to the reorganization of the cabinet. The general approach will be that Marshal Pétain remains the head of state, Admiral Darlan remains the designated successor to the head of state, and the position of Prime Minister is currently held concurrently by the head of state or will be assigned to someone else.</p>
<p>Vichy, 14th (United Press) - According to unofficial sources, the new Vichy cabinet will be led by Laval as associate and in charge of foreign and internal affairs, while the current associate Darlan will be solely in charge of national defense.</p>
<p>Washington, 14th (Reuters) - There is considerable concern here about the developments in the French political situation. The results of the talks between Marshal Pétain and Laval have not yet been announced, causing considerable anxiety. There are clear signs that Germany is exerting heavy pressure on the Vichy government.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 14th (Haitong News Agency) - According to Swedish newspapers, Sir Cripps has likely arrived in Cairo and is expected to arrive in London tomorrow or the day after. After returning to the country, he will immediately report the details of the British-Indian negotiations to the cabinet, and then the House of Commons will debate the Indian issue.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 14th (Haitong News Agency) - Swedish newspapers received a dispatch from London stating that the British government believes that although the British-Indian negotiations in New Delhi have broken down, the situation is not hopeless and other ways to resolve it can still be found. Several London evening newspapers believe that in Sir Cripps' report or in the debate in the House of Commons next week, a new way to reach an understanding with India can certainly be found.</p>
<p>Calcutta, 14th (Reuters) - The British-Indian negotiations have failed. Today's editorial in the local newspaper "The Statesman" proposes a solution. It is claimed that both the British and Indian sides regarded the Governor-General of India as an institution, not a legal person, during the negotiations in New Delhi. If both sides can have a new concept, viewing the Governor-General as a national leader, it may not be a way out. Viewing the Governor-General as an official with a constitutionally nominal title, and organizing a responsible cabinet by various parties is indeed difficult, but under the current circumstances, if the British King appoints an outstanding person as Governor-General, whose person should be supported by the Indian National Congress, the Muslim League, and the Conference of Princes, then this Governor-General will negotiate with the leaders of the British and Indian sides to organize a cabinet. The selection of cabinet members should not only be based on party affiliation but also on how to fight the war as a prerequisite. This is not a bad solution.</p>
<p>Washington, 14th (Reuters) - When Deputy Secretary of State Welles met with reporters from various countries yesterday, he was asked about his thoughts on the return of the British Lord Privy Seal Cripps from his trip to India without results. Welles replied that the United States was very disappointed with the failure of the British-Indian negotiations in New Delhi.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 13th (Havas News Agency) - British envoy to India Sir Stafford Cripps gave a broadcast speech the other day, stating that Britain will no longer have any new initiatives on the Indian issue. When a reporter asked Nehru, leader of the Indian National Congress, to comment on this when he met with the press today, Nehru immediately replied, "From now on, what we can expect from Britain is only obstacles to India's political and economic progress. The rumor that the National Congress has requested President Roosevelt's personal representative, Colonel Johnson, to mediate or arbitrate between Britain and India is not true. However, Colonel Johnson has expressed his desire to see the British-Indian talks achieve good results, but he cannot directly participate in the negotiations on the Indian issue. In fact, he has not participated."</p>
<p>New Delhi, 14th (Havas News Agency) - Jinnah, president of the All-India Muslim League, said here today in a conversation with reporters from various countries that if the demands put forward by the Indian National Congress are accepted, it would be tantamount to announcing the death of all Muslims in India. The party has completely erased other parties in India during this negotiation with the British envoy to India, Sir Cripps. As for the British proposal, the main points cannot be revised, which is very wrong. How can we only care about the present and ignore the future? Speaking of the future, our demand for partition is not expressly stipulated, and the right to self-determination has not been recognized. We cannot accept it and can only regard it as the basis of British policy.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 14th (Havas News Agency) - An amusing incident occurred today when Jinnah, the president of the All-India Muslim League, met with reporters. Because a certain newspaper had misreported the discussions of the Standing Committee of the Muslim League, Jinnah repeatedly requested its correction, but the newspaper ignored it. Luna therefore refused to allow the reporter of the newspaper to attend today's meeting. Unexpectedly, when the reporter of the newspaper withdrew, the reporters of other newspapers also acted in unison. All parties felt disappointed.</p>

<h3 id="e18">India Special Issue <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Since the cloud of war in the South China Sea extended to the Indian Ocean, the corner of India has become the focus of world attention. This is because the future of India is not only related to the gains and losses of the Pacific War but also to the movements of the global situation. Recent British-Indian negotiations have reached a deadlock. How they will develop in the future, whether they will continue to be delayed, or whether there will be other changes, all await the answer of future facts. However, the sentiments of the Indian people have rarely been noted by the outside world, and thus it is difficult to understand the current situation without being detached. Therefore, we have taken various aspects of India that the world is eager to understand, such as geography, race, history, political system, religion, and culture, and divided them into articles, exhausting the descriptions, and compiling them into a special issue. We will publish them daily, hoping that they will be of interest to those who care about world affairs.</p>
<p>1.  Starting with Geography</p>
<p>Opening the world map, the western part is occupied by most of North and South America. Separated by the Atlantic Ocean, to the north is Europe, disturbed by war, and to the south is the vast continent of Africa. Turning east from Africa, you can see the largest Indian peninsula. To the right of the peninsula is the Bay of Bengal, and to the left is the Arabian Sea, which connects to the Red Sea. Since the opening of the Suez Canal, Europe has gained the shortest route to transport spices and silk back, without having to go around the Cape of Good Hope, spending a long time to reach the East. Ceylon Island is the outpost of the Indian peninsula, towering in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>The Indian border has high mountains as a barrier. The Sulaiman Mountains in the northwest separate India from Afghanistan, and the Himalayas in the north, the highest mountain range in the world, divide India and Tibet in China into two parts. The eastern mountains become the natural boundary between Burma and India. Geographers usually divide India into three parts: first, the great mountain range that guards the Indian border; second, the vast northern plains, also known as the Indo-Gangetic Plain, which is formed by the basins of India's three major rivers—the Indus, the Ganges, and the Brahmaputra—and their tributaries; and third, the Indian Plateau, which is the southern part of the peninsula, formed by the opposition of the Eastern and Western Ghats, becoming the Deccan Plateau. In addition, there is the Thar Desert between the Ganges and Indus basins, with scarce rainfall.</p>
<p>India's coastline has very few deep bays and ports. If its people live in places far from the coast, such as North-West Frontier Province, Nagpur, or New Delhi, the heart of India, they simply do not know how vast the sea is. Because the coastline is regular, there are very few places that can be used as ports. Bombay is considered an excellent natural port, while Calcutta in eastern India, although also a port, is located on the Ganges Delta and is not on the sea. The eastern coast does not have as many rocks as the western coast, and there are many sandbars along the coast. Large ships cannot dock because the water is shallow, and there are many reefs, making it dangerous for small boats to navigate. Only Visakhapatnam and Madras have mail ships that can directly reach the docks. Both places use artificial construction of deep-water docks to allow ships to anchor.</p>
<p>There are three major rivers in northern India, as mentioned above. The origins of the three rivers are all in the mountain valleys on the northern border. The mountains are covered with snow all year round, and the climate is cold. The melting snow slowly flows into the riverbeds, along with mountain torrents, so the rivers are rapid and turbulent, flowing into the northern plains, where the water is calm and like a mirror. Because the terrain is flat, the rivers often abandon their original riverbeds and seek new routes. The rivers in the peninsular part are different from those in the plains. The main rivers flowing eastward, such as the Mahanadi River and the Godavari River, and those flowing westward, such as the Narmada River and the Tapti River, all originate from the plateau. The water volume is mainly accumulated by the monsoon rains, and the river water is extremely shallow when it is not the rainy season, and only very small boats can navigate. The slope of the Indian Plateau is from west to east, so rainwater flows eastward from the Western Ghats and into the Bay of Bengal.</p>
<p>Because it is located in the tropics, India's temperature is very high with little variation. Especially in the central plains, it is extremely hot, and epidemics are prevalent. The Himalayan mountains are located at a higher latitude and are relatively mild. Many people go there to escape the summer heat. The Deccan Plateau is higher in elevation and cooler than the northern plains. There is very little rainfall in the lower reaches of the Indus River, and the fields require artificial irrigation. The northern plains of India, such as Punjab, United Provinces, and Sindh, suffer from drought and require water from canals to irrigate the fields.</p>
<p>Agriculture is India's main production, and seven-tenths of India's total population are farmers. The main products are rice, cotton, tea, jute, and sugarcane. The lower reaches of the Ganges are extremely rich in rice due to the fertile land. Cotton is produced in the lower reaches of the Indus River and the central Deccan Plateau, and the production ranks second in the world. The raw materials for British cotton textiles are supplied from here. In addition to the abundant production of tea in Ceylon, Assam, Bengal, and other places have transplanted tea seeds from China and sell them to the European and American markets. Jute is India's main export, and the place of origin is the same as tea. Other products such as opium, rubber, and coffee are also produced. In terms of animal husbandry related to agriculture, transportation of heavy timber, etc., there are huge elephant teams. Cattle are the first choice for cultivation and towing vehicles. India has one cow for every two people, and its cow production ranks first in the world. Mineral resources include coal, oil, manganese, gold, and gemstones. Coal is produced in western Bengal, oil is produced in Punjab and Assam, and manganese is produced in Madras and Bombay, with the production ranking first in the world. Gold mines are located in Mysore and Hyderabad, and gemstones have been famous production sites since ancient times, with even more near the Yunnan border. India is rich in resources everywhere, and the products are abundant. Most of Britain's economic resources are supplied from here. Therefore, Britain must have self-awareness regarding today's Indian issue. The situation has reached a critical juncture, and mutual understanding is necessary for there to be hope for the future.</p>
<p>In terms of politics, India is divided into two parts: British India, ruled by the Indian government, which has a governor-general who presides over all Indian political affairs; and the Indian princely states, each governed by its local princes. The capital was originally in Calcutta, but after 1912, it was moved to New Delhi. India has a vast territory, and the British Indian government divides India into eleven major provinces and six minor provinces. The Indian princely states are ruled by princes, and the Indian government appoints a political advisor to assist in governing political affairs. Some tribal areas are extremely large, such as Hyderabad and Mysore, and directly contact the government, while others are as small as a few square miles and maintain contact with the provincial government offices within their borders. Brahmanism, Islam, and Buddhism are all popular in the country. Brahmanism is Hinduism, and there are many followers, divided into five classes: monks, nobles, commoners, laborers, and slaves, with strict boundaries. Islam is prevalent in Balochistan. Buddhism originated in India, and fewer Indians believe in it. There are many followers in Burma and Thailand, which are the world's two major Buddhist countries. In addition, there are also those who believe in Christianity, Sikhism, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism, each establishing its own sect, and sometimes even conflicts occur.</p>
<p>India has a population of approximately 340 million people (340,000,000). The population density is not even. Some parts have very few people, while some cities have a dense population. Generally, most people live in the plains or higher mountainous areas, alluvial soils, or land that has been reclaimed by human labor. There are as many as hundreds of languages, the most common being Hindi and Bengali.</p>
<p>The capital, New Delhi, is strategically located in the heart of the northern plains. It is the sixth largest city in the country, with railways extending in all directions and flourishing industry and commerce. The surrounding land is well irrigated, and cotton production is abundant, which is transported to the factories in New Delhi for spinning. The architecture is beautiful, especially the magnificent and luxurious Governor's House, which is rare in the world.</p>
<p>Calcutta, as the gateway to the Indian plains, can be called India's "commercial capital." Large merchant ships can freely enter and exit, and the rich agricultural products of the Ganges basin are exported here. Railways run across India from here to Bombay, Madras, the cities of southern India, or the Ganges basin. It has grand universities, parks, botanical gardens, museums, etc., and is known as the London of India.</p>
<p>Bombay is the second largest city in India, with a population of over one million. The harbor is deep and wide, and anchoring is safe, making it the best commercial port in India. The city of Bombay is built on a small island on the opposite shore, similar to the situation in Singapore. The plateau behind Bombay is extremely rich in cotton production. After the raw materials are collected, they are sent to the cotton mills in Bombay for spinning, so Bombay's textile industry is the leading one in Asia. The city streets are clean, the temple architecture is magnificent, and there are complete docks and warehouses, with a slight European and American atmosphere.</p>
<p>Madras is the third largest city in India, with a population of approximately 500,000. The main export is leather, and the main industry is tanning. The coastline here was originally very straight and could not be considered a good harbor. Since the British worked hard to develop it, building breakwaters, setting up trestle bridges, and dredging the seabed, large ships can be berthed, resulting in the prosperity of today. It can be seen that the efforts of the people are sufficient to transform the defects of nature.</p>

<h3 id="e19">Important British and American Military and Political Figures Continue Talks. War Headquarters Moves to London. The US and the Soviet Union Discuss War Supply Issues <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>London, 13th (Havas) - US Army Chief of Staff General Marshall has been holding talks with important British military and political figures in recent days. The content of the talks is being kept secret by both sides. It is only known that General Marshall has had repeated secret talks with Prime Minister Churchill, and even the Prime Minister's most trusted cabinet members have not participated. To appease public opinion, those in charge have issued statements saying that the British-American talks are progressing smoothly and are quite satisfactory. However, because the issues under discussion are very complex, it is necessary to deliberate at length. The planned schedule must be changed, and the talks will continue next week.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 14th (Haitong News Agency) - According to reports, Hopkins, President Roosevelt's personal representative and chairman of the Allied War Supply Committee, which is responsible for allocating US war materials to countries at war with Germany, had a lengthy meeting with Soviet Ambassador Maisky at the US Embassy in London yesterday to discuss the Soviet Union's request for the United States to increase its supply of war materials.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 13th (Havas) - The Swiss newspaper "Journal de Genève" recently published a dispatch from its London correspondent stating that British military figures believe that Germany will attack Iceland in the shortest possible time. In recent months, the United States has been shipping various goods to Murmansk to aid the Soviet Union, and Iceland's position has become increasingly important. Moreover, in recent days, Germany's activities in the North Atlantic have become increasingly active. It is therefore expected that Germany will attempt to occupy Iceland to cut off the route of US merchant convoys. It is not surprising. It is inevitable that US Army Chief of Staff General Marshall's talks with British General Staff officers will discuss this matter.</p>

<p>Washington, 14th (Reuters) - Undersecretary of State Welles declared yesterday that if Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary provide substantial assistance to the Axis powers in the war against the Soviet Union, President Roosevelt will recommend to Congress that it declare war on those countries.</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Reuters) - Bulgaria's new Army Chief, General Mihov, issued an order to the Bulgarian Army today, stating that the Bulgarian Army must prepare diligently and do its utmost to be prepared for any eventuality. He expressed his strong belief that the allies of Bulgaria would ultimately be victorious.</p>
<p>London, 14th (Reuters) - Rome - Mussolini and Ciano received the head of the Bulgarian General Staff, General Zaimov, yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Rome, 14th (Haitong News Agency) - After the visit of Italian Chief of General Staff General Cavallero to Hungary, the Hungarian Chief of General Staff returned the visit to Italy. He arrived in Rome yesterday, and General Cavallero and other senior generals greeted him at the station.</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Haitong News Agency) - The German Foreign Ministry stated yesterday that the reorganization of the Bulgarian government would not affect its foreign policy. Bulgarian Foreign Minister Popov had been ill for a long time and had held the post for quite some time, so he decided to resign.</p>
<p>Budapest, 14th (Haitong News Agency) - The Hungarian Parliament is scheduled to convene on the 23rd of this month, at which time it will decide on the guidelines for parliamentary work.</p>
<p>London, 13th (Reuters) - A Reuters diplomatic correspondent wrote that one of the most noteworthy aspects of the current Bulgarian cabinet crisis is the timing of its occurrence, which was after King Boris of Bulgaria had just returned from Germany. King Boris and Prime Minister Filov have been forced to actively participate in the German war effort. However, this move may lead to a break in Bulgaria's relations with the Soviet Union. Therefore, they have found it necessary to bring in new people who will resolutely implement the policy of cooperation with Germany. The dismissal of Army Chief Daskalov is even more important than the dismissal of Foreign Minister Popov. Daskalov is deeply aware of the true state of the Bulgarian army and recognizes the dangers of driving the Bulgarian army to fight. This kind of adventure is not only not supported by the Bulgarian people, but also harmful and useless. The Bulgarian people have a deep-rooted sense of gratitude to the Soviet Union for helping them gain liberation. It is noteworthy that Filov has stated that the changes in the cabinet will not affect Bulgarian-Turkish relations, but whether this is true remains to be seen.</p>
<h3 id="e21">The German-Soviet War Situation <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Rome, 13th (Havas) - According to Romanian military figures, military operations on the central section of the Eastern Front have become increasingly active in recent days, followed by the southern section. However, there are no large-scale battles. Only the German army's actions in the Stalino area can be described as a genuine victory. The consequences of this will be clear once the spring offensive begins. Currently, due to the muddy roads, it is difficult to conduct large-scale military operations. This situation may continue for another four weeks, but this is uncertain. However, one fact is worth noting: the initiative in the military situation, which had been in the hands of the Soviet Union for nearly five months due to the winter, is now gradually being transferred to the German army. An example of this is the German army's attack on Soviet positions in the Kharkov area on the night of the 11th of this month. The Soviet army has been forced to withdraw from several of its winter positions. As for the rumors that the Soviet army has recovered the city of Belgorod, they are not reliable. The Stalino front has been quite calm in recent days, and the Soviet army has apparently abandoned its counteroffensive plan, which it had formulated five days ago.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Influential Turkish Member of Parliament Calls for World Peace in an Article Published in the "Cumhuriyet" Newspaper <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Istanbul, 13th (Havas) - Nadi, a member of the National Assembly and editor of the "Cumhuriyet" newspaper, published an article in the newspaper today, urging the warring countries of Europe to think carefully before launching the dreaded spring offensive. The article stated that the spring offensive would be launched in no more than a month. In other words, if the major warring countries do not decide to reconsider their current positions and seek ways to restore peace within a month, this opportunity will be lost forever. We have a moral responsibility to the warring countries themselves and to all of humanity to make this view known to the world. The Axis powers, especially Japan and Germany, have already achieved great success, but they have not yet reached the point of no return. It is not too late to hold negotiations and conclude peace today, recognizing the United States as a world power. If this were done, not only would Europe still have the possibility of establishing a new order, but also the future of all mankind would be secure. Nadi is an influential member of the National Assembly, and the "Cumhuriyet" newspaper is an authoritative newspaper in this country. This article will certainly have a significant impact. People therefore believe that Turkey, although it has never intended to mediate between the warring countries, may now adapt to the times and change its attitude. Although the above article does not represent the official opinion, it is undoubtedly sufficient to represent the emotions and wishes of most Turkish people. As for the government, it still indicates that it has no intention of doing so, as it rarely considers such a move unless it is requested by the parties concerned or Turkey anticipates a considerable degree of certainty.</p>

Informed sources believe that this legislation will include measures to control prices, wages, profits, and tax increases.</p>

<p>Washington, 14th (Havas) - Rumors have spread that representatives of Britain and Germany are negotiating peace terms in Stockholm, Sweden. Undersecretary of State Welles stated today when meeting with reporters that he had no knowledge of this. In view of the policy pursued by the US government, the Washington authorities are not interested in such negotiations.</p>
<p>Washington, 13th (Reuters) - When Acting Secretary of State Welles received reporters, reporters inquired about rumors that Hitler's representatives were currently active in Stockholm and carrying tentative peace proposals for the United States. Welles sternly replied, "The US government is not at all concerned about it." The matter inquired about by the reporter is a widespread rumor here that German bankers in Stockholm are now trying to negotiate with US representatives in order to present Hitler's final peace terms to various countries.</p>

<p>London, 14th (Reuters) - According to Vichy news agencies, fighting between Kursk and Kharkov on the Soviet front has become more intense in the past 24 hours. Soviet pressure is particularly strong to the northeast of Belgorod. Since Monday afternoon, Soviet motorized units have been attempting to advance towards Timarovka and cross the Donets River. There has also been fierce fighting to the southeast of Belgorod, where Soviet advance units have infiltrated the important railway connecting central Soviet Union with Kursk, Kharkov, and Dnepropetrovsk, and have advanced to a point not far from the railway. There has also been heavy fighting further south in the Stalino region. At the same time, the Soviet noon communique stated that no major changes occurred on the front line on the night of April 13.</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Haitong News Agency) - According to German sources, the German army in the central section of the Eastern Front still maintains its advantage, crossing the river and pursuing the Soviet army, destroying several fortifications. Enemy attacks were repelled by artillery and infantry. In the northern section of the Eastern Front, the Soviet army used tanks and artillery to assist in the fighting, but the German army repelled them with the assistance of tanks. The Soviet army on the Lapland front also suffered heavy losses. The German army on the Leningrad front shelled enemy military targets with artillery.</p>

<p>London, 14th (Reuters) - An accident occurred yesterday during exercises by tank units and air force units in southern England, resulting in the deaths of fourteen people, including a brigade commander, and injuries to forty to fifty soldiers. As for the cause of the accident, it is said that the War Office recently issued an order to all units to use live ammunition during exercises in order to familiarize the exercise units with actual war conditions. Yesterday, during the exercise, dive bombers performed bombing and machine-gunning of ground targets. Hundreds of people were lined up to watch and could not avoid the fire, resulting in the accident.</p>
<p>London, 14th (Reuters) - It is now known that nineteen people were killed and more than thirty seriously injured in the army exercise near Downs yesterday. Aircraft and tanks participated in the exercise in order to allow the troops to become accustomed to real combat conditions. It is believed that deaths and injuries occurred when one aircraft made a dive-bombing run on the troops. The War Office recently ordered the use of live ammunition during exercises and believes that this is an essential element of training.</p>

<p>London, 14th (Reuters) - Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir Kingsley Wood stated in the House of Commons today during the discussion of this year's budget that the government has decided to continue collecting special taxes on tobacco for one year and sugar taxes for two years. Sir Kingsley stated that the government has greatly increased its reserves of essential foods and that private reserves are also not depleted. However, the supply has been exhausted. Regarding the stabilization of market prices, Sir Kingsley said that the level of major prices has indeed been reduced and rents have also been stabilized. The government spent £125,000,000 on stabilizing prices last year, and this may need to be increased this year. The budget for this year is £2,074,000,000 to £2,880,000,000, with total expenditure being £4,776,000,000 and the budget being £4,500,000,000.</p>

<p>Washington, 14th (Havas) - Regarding the establishment of a consulate by the United States in Brazzaville, French Equatorial Africa, which is occupied by the Free French forces, Undersecretary of State Welles sent a letter to French Ambassador to the United States Henri-Haye today, responding to the protest lodged by the French government on the 9th of this month. The letter stated that the US government would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the policies it is pursuing with regards to the French nation. As the French government and many French nationals have previously assisted the Americans in the fight for liberty, this is the foundation on which both countries can trust and have good relations with each other. The U.S. government will recognize France's sovereignty over its land and its colonies. However, until the French can fully maintain sovereignty over their country, the U.S. government will relate to the French people in areas that the U.S. considers in the Atlantic and Pacific. In summary, the U.S. government and nation will completely respect all sorts of sovereignty that France owns.</p>

<p>Bern, Switzerland, 14th (Havas) - The Swiss newspaper "Journal de Genève" today published a special dispatch from Berlin stating that German military figures acknowledge that the British Air Force is currently using a new type of bomb with destructive power that is not easily countered. The bomb is shaped like a phosphorus-filled iron can, is easy to burn, and contains several quarts of liquid. It is dropped by parachute and can float to a great distance. Some have even floated to Tilsit in East Prussia. Phosphorus is an extremely dangerous substance, so the new type of bomb can undoubtedly cause significant damage to forests and buildings.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Suspension of Trial in the National Betrayal Case for Expanded Investigation <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Vichy, 14th - Havas News Agency: According to a government gazette announcement, the Supreme Court in Riom has suspended the trial of the national betrayal case to allow for further investigation. Previously, when investigating the responsibility for France's defeat, the Supreme Court believed that some individuals had no direct relationship with diplomacy and military affairs. Therefore, only six of the most relevant individuals were to be tried. Subsequently, it was discovered that many others were responsible for France's defeat, and it was deemed necessary to investigate the truth to correct public opinion. The Supreme Court has therefore expanded the investigation. This measure does not restrict the judges in any way; the impartiality and competence of these judges are well-regarded and beyond doubt. The status of the defendants will also remain unchanged. It is reported that the Riom Supreme Court was established on August 16, 1940, and opened on February 19, 1942, holding a total of twenty-four sessions, recording the statements of six defendants and the testimonies of thirty-six witnesses. Apart from reading out the charges, no verdict has been delivered.</p>
<p>Riom, France, 14th - Havas News Agency: Following the suspension of the national betrayal case trial, Supreme Court President Caivos announced the adjournment for the day. The defendants remain detained at the Porlagnon battery prison and do not need to be transferred to the Supreme Court prison.</p>

<p>Bern, Switzerland, 13th - Havas News Agency: According to a Zurich Daily correspondent in Berlin, Germany has invented a new type of "electric eye aircraft" capable of long-distance flight and equipped with night flying equipment. It has been incorporated into the country's airline routes. The German Air Force has also begun using it. The aircraft can accommodate several people and is equipped with special devices that can detect the approach of enemy aircraft. This equipment is similar to the "electric eye" in some radio receivers, and the electric eye can automatically extend or retract based on the wavelength of radio waves.</p>

<p>The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reports that the Japanese authorities recently announced that all old permits for foreigners would be invalidated from April 11 and that these old permits must be returned to the Japanese Consulate General by April 20. With only six days left until the deadline, the return of permits is proceeding smoothly. Foreigners are personally going to the Japanese Consulate General in the Ritz Hotel Building to cancel their permits. New permits have begun to be issued to foreigners residing outside the perimeter line area and those who have sufficient reason to enter and leave the inner and outer perimeter areas. At the same time, foreigners are no longer required to show permits when crossing the Suzhou Creek to Hongkou and Yangshupu or when entering Western Shanghai through the barricades. Since the recent change in the permit system for foreigners, restrictions have been relaxed. Therefore, Allied or neutral nationals do not need permits when traveling within the inner perimeter line.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Shanghai Municipal Council Sends Personnel to Investigate Price-Controlled Items <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Patrol Officers and Customers Can Report Violations of Price Limits or Short Measures</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Price Control Office is very strict in enforcing price controls, and many cases of merchants violating price limits were punished last month. The office sends out multiple investigators every day, secretly visiting stores and stalls with price-controlled items to investigate whether the prices exceed the limits or the measures are short. In addition to investigative experience, these investigators also carry scales and measuring instruments when necessary for on-site verification.</p>
<p>Preliminary Inquiries The office can also send investigators to re-examine based on reports from patrol officers or customers, or summon shop owners selling price-controlled items to inquire about their reasons. If the reasons they provide are insufficient, penalties will be imposed. The office handles dozens to hundreds of cases of price violations each month.</p>
<p>Penalties The penalties, whether assisting others in violating or attempting to violate the regulations, are divided into the following: Confiscation or revocation of the license; Closure of the premises for a certain period; Denial of access to the various conveniences of the Shanghai Municipal Council's controlled goods offices; Confiscation of goods equal in value to the amount of the fine to be imposed. Violators may pay a fine deemed appropriate by the Executive Committee for Price Control Regulations to replace the above penalties.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Buddhist Brotherhood to Provide Relief in Ningbo, Increasing Corn Flour Distribution by 1,500 Stone <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>The porridge distribution center at the Fahua Temple on Chaole Road in Shanghai was jointly established by the Shanghai Buddhist Brotherhood and the Ningbo merchant community in Shanghai. Since its opening in the tenth lunar month of last year, it has been distributing porridge at the Dongyue Temple to 3,500 people daily, with each person receiving two catties of porridge, sufficient for one day's food. The rice for this porridge was purchased in Ningbo, totaling 200 stone of white rice, and 125 bags of white rice and 2,700 dan of corn were shipped from Shanghai, in three shipments. During the third shipment of 1,400 dan of corn, benefactor Wang Shanxiang accompanied the ship to Ningbo. After arriving in Ningbo, in addition to planning everything with the local staff, he saw that the famine victims were everywhere, all with pale faces, and that immediate relief was imperative. Therefore, he convened a meeting with the staff and decided to add 1,500 stone of corn flour for distribution starting from the first day of the third lunar month. Master Miao'an, Master Juecheng, Master Xianzong, and Ren Xipeng were responsible for investigating and distributing the flour. Therefore, the number of people receiving aid has now reached 5,000. In addition to the rice that has already been shipped to Ningbo, 200 stone of white rice has recently been purchased locally, and 500 dan of corn is still stored in the Shanghai warehouse. Transportation procedures are currently being expedited to prepare for shipment to Ningbo. Therefore, the scheduled distribution time will continue until the end of the sixth lunar month, according to the original plan, and there is no need to worry about a shortage of rice after that. The funds for purchasing rice in both locations, as well as the funds for distributing 3,100 sets of cotton clothes last winter, totaled more than 30 million yuan. Currently, more than 11,000 yuan has been collected in donations in Shanghai, and 27,000 yuan has been collected in Ningbo. The shortfall of more than 60,000 yuan is being advanced by the founders, who hope that all sectors will continue to help and actively raise funds. Also, since the evacuation of people from Shanghai, the number of residents in Ningbo has increased sharply. As the weather is gradually warming up and summer is approaching, in order to prevent epidemics, we are collecting various hygiene medicines such as Ten Drops Water, Sha Yao Dan, etc. If you would like to help, please send them to the office at Fachang Temple and obtain a receipt.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Spring Garden Visit <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The race of time has finally brought the bright spring. Nature comforts people equally. Men, women, old and young, suffocated in the dusty city streets, take a breath and take a walk in the park. In Shanghai, Guangqi Park and Gujiazhai Park are usually visited by ordinary people. Because of the hustle and bustle of tourists, they may not feel the quiet and ethereal mood, so many people like to visit private gardens. It is really leisurely and far-reaching to wander among the pavilions and winding corridors. The Ai Li Garden can be regarded as an ideal place. Its entire layout still preserves the intention of Chinese gardens, with a stream of flowing water and several smoky willows, winding and quiet, not a panoramic view. Here are two views of the Ai Li Garden: (Top) Long bridge and winding fence, clear stream reflecting; (Bottom) Garden gate and smoky willows, with a pavilion in the background.</p>

<p>Second landlords and subtenants should pay attention and do not negotiate with those who have no identification documents. The Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office announces that the staff of the Housing Subletting License Enforcement Office carry identification documents with them. Second landlords and subtenants in sublet houses are requested to pay attention. In order to protect their own interests, do not allow people without identification documents to come to negotiate. If you encounter anyone suspected of impersonating a representative of the office, you must immediately report it to the nearest police station.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Sharp Drop in Temperature, Stable Air Pressure <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>The weather in Shanghai was extremely hot the day before yesterday, with the highest temperature rising to 76 degrees Fahrenheit. Even in light clothing, there was no coolness. But from 2:00 AM yesterday, the west wind picked up, followed by showers, especially at dawn, when there was heavy rain. Since then, the rain and wind have continued all day. Yesterday's highest temperature has dropped to 46.6 degrees Fahrenheit, and the wind is quite strong, about 3 points. The eaves dripped incessantly. However, the air pressure is very stable, and there seems to be hope for sunny weather. The cold intensified until late at night, and the rain was still flying. Due to the sudden cold weather, the number of frozen corpses on the street increased. According to Pushan Villa, 36 adult corpses, 26 child corpses, and 48 infant corpses were collected and buried by the villa yesterday, totaling 106 corpses. It can be imagined that it is difficult for refugees to make a living due to hunger and cold.</p>
<p>More Than One Hundred Corpses Found Near Jiǔmǔdì</p>
<p>Yesterday, nearly a hundred people died in the Jiǔmǔdì area of Nanshi and on both sides of the Minguo Road, which borders the Chinese and French concessions. These corpses decompose faster after being soaked in rainwater. It is hoped that the relevant authorities will pay attention, inform charity organizations as soon as possible, and bury them as soon as possible, without allowing them to remain, so as not to cause odors and affect the health of residents and pedestrians in sunny weather.</p>

<p>Huaguang News Agency reports that Fuhexiang Money Exchange, located at 23 Fada Road, was found to have illegally raised the exchange rate when a merchant brought 10,000 yuan of French currency to the exchange to purchase new Central Reserve Currency. After being discovered by Chinese police, the case was reported to the French police station. The administrative authorities believed that the exchange had disrupted the financial market and fined the exchange 4,000 yuan as a warning.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Beer Shortage: Consumption Expected to Be Restricted in the Future <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Allied News Agency reports that the supply of Japanese-made beer in Central China has been interrupted recently due to ships and other reasons. Therefore, it is necessary to rely on products from Shanghai. However, only Ewo beer is currently available in Shanghai, and Shanghai Beer has not been seen on the market. Therefore, the beer shortage in Shanghai has become increasingly prominent recently. The manufacturers of Ewo and Shanghai Beer in Shanghai are both British-owned and are currently managed by the Japanese military authorities. The Shanghai Beer factory is directly managed by the Japanese military and entrusted to an agent to operate. It is still operating as usual, but most of its products are used for military purposes, and sales on the market have been temporarily suspended. Ewo is entrusted to the Chinese Beer Company to operate, and a small number of products are available on the market. Under the current situation where Japanese-made beer is no longer imported, it is difficult to meet the needs of all sectors by relying on this small amount of products. Therefore, it is not difficult to predict that beer consumption will gradually be restricted in the future.</p>

<p>Although the schedule of the Haitong and Hualin ships sailing between Shanghai and Ningbo has been arranged, there are times when they have not been able to sail on time. The Changshan Maru of the East Asia Shipping Company is scheduled to sail to Ningbo on the 15th, but passengers will not be carried temporarily.</p>
<p>Haitong Sails to Ningbo</p>
<p>The Haitong wheel of the East Zhejiang Shipping Company was originally scheduled to leave port at the afternoon of the 13th, but because the procedures for loading goods and leaving port had not been completed, it began to cast anchor at the Yangtze Wharf yesterday (14). There were more passengers on this trip than on the previous few trips, because ships such as Narutomon, which used to carry passengers between Shanghai and Ningbo, have now stopped sailing.</p>
<p>Hualin Continues to Sail</p>
<p>The Hualin was originally the Baoli wheel. The ship used to sail on the Shanghai-Wenzhou line. After the suspension of navigation, it changed its name to its current name and sailed between Shanghai and Ningbo. The tickets for this trip, which is scheduled for the 19th, have long been sold out, and those who purchased the 10th-day tickets for the ship have not yet been able to board. Therefore, it is said that the sailing on the 10th was purely to carry passengers who purchased the 10th-day tickets.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Five Societies Lecture: Explanation of the Thirteen Classics with Commentaries and Subcommentaries, Yang Zhongyi Lectures on the Essence of the Doctrine of the Mean <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The 40th lecture of the Five Classics Society, the 7th session of the National Studies Lecture, Mr. Shen Jue explained the Thirteen Classics with Commentaries and Subcommentaries, divided into seven sections: General Introduction, List of the Thirteen Classics, Names of Commentaries on the Thirteen Classics, Commentators, Names of Subcommentaries on the Thirteen Classics, Subcommentators, and Conclusion. Briefly stated, the Thirteen Classics with Commentaries and Subcommentaries are essential books for scholars of the Classics and an entry point for beginners. 1. Book of Changes: Commented on by Wang Bi of Wei and Han Kangbo of Jin. 2. Book of Documents: Tradition attributed to Kong Anguo of the Han dynasty (spurious). 3. Book of Poetry: Tradition attributed to Mao Heng of the Han dynasty, Commentary by Zheng Xuan. The three Classics were all subcommented by Kong Yingda of the Tang dynasty, the Kong Subcommentary is called "Zhengyi" (Correct Meaning). 4. Zhou Rites, 5. Book of Etiquette and Ceremonial: Both commented on by Zheng Xuan, subcommented by Jia Gongyan of the Tang dynasty, called "Shi" (Explanation). 6. Record of Rites: Commented on by Zheng Xuan. 7. Spring and Autumn Annals with Zuo Commentary: Jin dynasty Du Yu made "Collected Explanations of the Classic and Commentary," also with Kong's "Zhengyi." 8. Gongyang Commentary: Han dynasty He Xiu explained and discussed, Tang dynasty Xu Yan subcommented, called "Jie." 9. Guliang Commentary: Jin dynasty Fan Ning's "Collected Explanations," Tang dynasty Yang Shixun's subcommentary called "Shi." 10. Analects: Wei dynasty He Yan's explanations and discussions. 11. Classic of Filial Piety: Commented on by Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang dynasty. 12. Erya: Commented on by Guo Pu of the Jin dynasty. The three books were all subcommented by Xing Bing of the Song dynasty, called "Zhengyi," the Erya called "Shi." 13. Mencius: Commented on by Zhao Qi of the Han dynasty, falsely titled "Zhengyi" by Sun Shi of the Song dynasty. "Zhu" (Commentary), "Zhuan" (Tradition), "Jian" (Annotation), "Jiegu" (Explanation and Discussion), and "Jijie" (Collected Explanations), although the names are different, they are all Commentaries. "Zhengyi" (Correct Meaning), "Shi" (Explanation), and "Jie" (Explanation), although the names are not the same, they are all Subcommentaries. Therefore, they are collectively called the Thirteen Classics with Commentaries and Subcommentaries. Qing dynasty Ruan Yuan published the Thirteen Classics with Commentaries and Subcommentaries with collations, each preceded by a summary from the General Catalogue of the Siku Quanshu, which is very detailed. The key to studying the Classics lies in carefully studying the text, then one can gain understanding. For example, the ancient text of the Shangshu (Book of Documents) by the spurious Kong, its meaning is actually shallower than the modern text and is easy to understand at a glance. It is especially because many ancient maxims are collected in it, such as "The human heart is precarious, the heart of the Way is subtle," and "Be diligent in the service of the state, be frugal in the management of the home," whose meanings are timeless, so the spurious ancient text still exists today. Confucius instructed his son Boyu to learn poetry and rites. Among the commentaries and subcommentaries, the Poetry Classic and the three Ritual texts are the most refined and should be carefully studied. (Zheng Xuan's commentary follows Mao Heng, while also adopting the theories of the Qi, Lu, and Han schools, so it is not entirely the same as Mao's tradition.) Mr. Yang Zhongyi lectured on the essence of the Doctrine of the Mean, saying, "The return that is not far off is for cultivating oneself." The Great Learning says, "From the Son of Heaven down to the common people, all must regard cultivation of the person as the root." Therefore, "The superior man cannot but cultivate himself." Mencius says, "The superior man guards his person and then the world is at peace." Confucius, Zengzi, and Mencius passed down the same lineage, all taking self-cultivation as the ultimate goal of establishing the Way of man, and self-cultivation must begin with sincerity. Therefore, the Book of Changes speaks of "preserving sincerity," the Great Learning speaks of "sincere intention," and the Doctrine of the Mean and Mencius speak of "utmost sincerity," "Sincerity is the Way of Heaven, striving for sincerity is the Way of Man," "The Way of Man," all distantly follow the "establishing the Way of Man" in the Explanation of the Trigrams. The superior man embodies benevolence, benevolence is being human, combined they are the Way. The superior man's inherent nature follows the nature mandated by Heaven, realizing it is nature. Nature is human nature, the Way is the Way of man. Education is to teach people the Way of man. Filial piety and fraternal respect are the foundation of being human, when the foundation is established, the Way arises, being able to do without learning, knowing without thinking. Even the foolish and unworthy among husbands and wives can share in this knowledge and ability, order the household, delight in wife and children, harmonize with brothers, obey parents, trust friends, and distinguish between superiors and inferiors. The essence of supreme virtue lies in harmony without resentment. When the father is alive, observe his intentions, seeing the invisible, listening to the inaudible; when the father is dead, observe his actions, mourn with utmost grief, and offer sacrifices with utmost solemnity. Shun was greatly filial, King Wu was thoroughly filial. Knowing man and knowing Heaven is the root of virtue and the origin of education, the reality of benevolence, righteousness, wisdom, rites, and music, the path to understanding goodness and making the self sincere. (The consistent Way) The sincerity that exists in oneself is loyalty, its application to things and people is called shu (reciprocity), extending one's own heart. Treating others with sincerity is called trustworthiness, they are one. If a person can exhaust the sincerity of his heart and extend it to all things and people, then he will immediately understand the hunger and drowning of others, drawing close to himself, embracing everything. Without separation, there is benevolence. Therefore, Confucius greatly emphasized the Way of benevolence and insisted on being consistent with loyalty and reciprocity. Zengzi's "one, indeed" uniquely obtained the transmission of Confucius' consistent Way, saying, "The Master's Way is loyalty and reciprocity, that's all." Zisi, in his Doctrine of the Mean, also quotes Confucius: "Loyalty and reciprocity are not far from the Way." Therefore, Zengzi examined himself three times a day for disloyalty in planning and untrustworthiness in associating, changing loyalty and reciprocity to loyalty and trustworthiness. The Great Learning says, "The superior man has the great Way, he must obtain it with loyalty and trustworthiness." The Commentary on the Words of the Text says, "Loyalty and trustworthiness are the means to advance in virtue." The Doctrine of the Mean speaks of the Way, the Book of Changes speaks of virtue, they are one. Among the four things Confucius taught, loyalty and trustworthiness occupy two of them, saying "words must be loyal and trustworthy," and "he must have loyalty and trustworthiness." And "make loyalty and trustworthiness the chief," that is, even in ordinary casual speech, he only speaks of loyalty and trustworthiness. As for "thoughtful words," "being loyal to others," and "loyal counsel," then he only speaks of loyalty. "A man without trustworthiness is unacceptable," and "the people without trust cannot stand," then he only speaks of trustworthiness. "Love them without tiring, be loyal to them without wearying," then he changes loyalty and trustworthiness to loyalty and love. If we summarize the main point, calling it loyalty is enough, if we broaden its meaning, citing reciprocity completes it, while trustworthiness and love are established with names according to where they are applied. Confucius' Way is supreme, and his personal practice and teaching of others are only this consistent meaning of loyalty and reciprocity. Loyalty and reciprocity are what the sages use for teaching and learning, the foundation of self-cultivation, and the Way of man, which cannot be separated from for even a moment, this is what is called consistency. To summarize its essence: "What you do not want done to yourself, do not do to others," these two phrases exhaust it. The Doctrine of the Mean says, "What you apply to yourself and do not wish for, do not apply to others." Cheng Yi thought this was reciprocity. Zigong said, "What I do not wish others to do to me, I also wish to do to no one." Cheng Yi thought this was benevolence. This is the consistent transmission of the Sage's gate. Besides Zeng Can, there was also Duanmu Ci, and Zisi inherited the family learning and also obtained the teachers' instruction, so they came from the same source. The Great Learning says, "The Way of the measuring square," the Doctrine of the Mean says, "First apply what you seek," Mencius says, "Give them what they desire, do not apply what they dislike." This is the consistent transmission of Confucius, Zengzi, and Zisi, the transmission of the Way to become a sage. At the end, Mr. Sun Xiangzhong and Mr. Yang Fawen thoroughly explained the meaning of loyalty, trustworthiness, and sincerity, and the listeners were deeply moved.</p>

<h3 id="e49">Buddhist Community Seeks to Save Morals and Rectify Civic Discipline <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>With rampant greed and unrestrained enjoyment of material pleasures, life in Shanghai is unstable. Since the outbreak of the war, the hearts of the people in Shanghai have been degenerating, and recently there have been many illegal and undisciplined actions, with people rushing to hoard goods and profiteer, as well as various improper behaviors. The motive behind these actions is nothing more than the desire to indulge in material pleasures for oneself, disregarding the interests of others. As a result, prices have risen, order has been disrupted, and even lives have been harmed, leading to terror. All of this is due to insatiable greed and the obscuring of one's true nature. The Buddhist community is deeply concerned about this and has held discussions on the matter. Now, Layman Huang Huishan has further explained the principles of abstaining from killing and greed, so that those who hear it may thoroughly understand them. The explanation states that the human mind is originally a Buddha-mind.</p>
<p>Abstaining from Greed</p>
<p>National Teacher Qingliang said, "If you compare your mind to the Buddha, you will be the same as the Buddha from beginning to end. The beginning and end are the same, only the middle is different." To understand why the middle is different, one should investigate the origin of human beings. Confucianism and Taoism say that humans inherit the harmony of Heaven and Earth, originating from the Wuji (Ultimateless), which gives rise to the Taiji (Supreme Ultimate), which in turn gives rise to the Two Forms, evolving into the three powers of Heaven, Earth, and Man. Buddhism, on the other hand, believes that humans and Heaven and Earth are all contained within the Alaya-consciousness. The Consciousness-Only theory states that everything is created by the mind, which shows that all things are ultimately empty. Humans originally possessed supreme and radiant light, born in the Heaven of Radiant Sound, and were called Devas (gods). The Dharma-body (spiritual body) permeated the Dharma-realm (universe). At that time, the earth was flat like a palm, and people could fly and soar, essentially the same as the Buddha. Only because of a single deluded thought, the three coarse and six subtle aspects arose: mountains, great earth, greed for play, and greed for earth-cakes. Disaster enters through the mouth. After greedily eating the earth-cakes, their spiritual nature diminished, drifting further from the Buddha, and they became earth-bound people. At this time, with radiant light, the one thought had not yet moved, the spiritual light was abundant, so it is said to be the same as the Buddha from the beginning. Once the one thought has moved, greedy desires and attachments arise, leading to suffering. The Awakening of Faith says, "Movement brings suffering." Cause and effect are inseparable. As greedy desires grow, unrestrained material pleasures are sought, and the human population increases daily. However, material resources are limited, and insatiable greed leads to a sense of insufficiency. Insufficiency leads to contention, contention leads to anger, fighting, and killing, plunging the entire world into chaos, harm, and terror. All of this is caused by greed and delusion obscuring the spiritual nature. My teacher explained that illuminating the mind and seeing one's nature means that the human mind is obscured by the three poisons, giving rise to eighty-four thousand afflictions. If these afflictions are peeled away layer by layer, one's true nature will appear, and the mind will become clear, then one can return to the Buddha-ground, meaning that one will be the same as the Buddha in the end. But how can one peel away these afflictions? Only by receiving and upholding the Five Precepts.</p>
<p>Abstaining from Killing</p>
<p>The first of the precepts is not to kill living beings. A sense of compassion is inherent in everyone. For example, when seeing pork, one chooses the fattest and leanest pieces to satisfy one's appetite. But if it were human flesh, everyone would be horrified and run away. In reality, pigs and humans are both flesh. It is only that eating pork is a habit, and one does not realize the cruelty involved. We should not kill, which means not killing animals and all sentient beings, nor should we neglect the invisible killing. If you want to know the suffering of war in the world, just listen to the sounds from the slaughterhouse in the middle of the night. The so-called "killing sounds" are not limited to the slaughterhouse, and the so-called "killing time" is not limited to midnight. When people catch and kill fleas, bedbugs, etc., that is also killing. This is visible killing. If people are blinded by the three poisons, leading to killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct, isn't that also a form of suicide? Their Dharma-body and life are obscured by delusion and attachments. If people can understand this, they should remove the three poisons, and the mind will naturally become clear. If evil is gone, then good is also absent. Good is merely the opposite of evil. If there is no root, where can evil exist? Bodhidharma sought to pacify the mind and looked for the mind but could not find it, and realized the principle of no-mind. One must know that no-mind is clarity, while having a mind leads to obscurity, resulting in disharmony. For example, if a preacher is attached to what he is preaching, then he is slandering the Buddha because having a mind leads to obscurity. The Sixth Patriarch's verse says, "Originally there is nothing," which means no-mind. When talking about illuminating the mind and seeing one's nature, regardless of any religion, as long as one understands thoroughly, it can be achieved. The Buddhist Ligue's theory incorporates various religions to reach a thorough state. For example, Jesus's universal love is limited to humans, which is somewhat narrow. Even among humans, there is contention between white and yellow, and discrimination between red and black, so there is still no equality. Some fathers teach their children not to kill piglets, but then kill cattle and sheep, chanting words while killing, saying, "Heaven does not create, earth does not grow, people do not eat, I do not kill," shifting the blame onto others, which is still not thorough. Buddhism is different, it treats animals and all sentient beings with equal compassion and universal love. In this way, the mind will naturally become clear and the nature will naturally appear. Those who study Buddhism, especially those who study the precepts, should view everything equally, without distinction between closeness and distance. What I now offer starts from small things, accumulating day by day, naturally eliminating all evil karma, and finally returning to my true nature, illuminating the mind and seeing my nature, then I will ultimately be the same as the Buddha.</p>

<p>All tramcars of the International Settlement are back in service, except for the No. 6 and No. 7 tram lines. Due to the suspension of bus service, the tramcar stops along all lines are extremely crowded with passengers. The Tramcar Department has added a new stop at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road to facilitate passengers boarding and alighting from tramcars traveling west on Nanjing Road from the Bund. They have also lengthened the platforms at each stop to accommodate standing passengers. The prospect of connecting the tramcars between the two settlements remains uncertain for the time being. Central Police Inspector Jones and Chinese Detective Zhu Wanjun previously investigated Zhou Shihai, Chairman of the Dagbing Youtiao (Chinese fried dough) Industry Association, and Zhang Guanshou, Chairman of the Mantou Bing (steamed bun and flatbread) Industry Association, for allegedly defrauding the Shanghai Municipal Council to obtain subsidized flour in the name of fellow traders, and arrested them accordingly. It has now been discovered that Jiangbei natives Zhen Wu of 729 Niuzhuang Road and Liang Xiaopeng of 21 Zhenwu Road also engaged in similar activities, and they were also arrested the day before yesterday and detained pending further investigation.</p>

<p>Xu Senbao (age 24), a young man from Jiangyin who had been an apprentice and was promoted to shop assistant in the Qian Changkang Grocery Store at 84 Ke'neng Road in Changshu, had been working there for ten years and was highly valued by Qian. Recently, Xu associated with bad friends, indulged in prostitution and gambling, and became unusually extravagant. On the morning of the 3rd of this month at 11:00 AM, Qian gave Xu a check for 13,535.60 yuan from the National Commercial Bank for deposit. However, Xu cashed the check at the Huiyuan Money Exchange, intending to remit the money to the Wanli Grocery Store in Jiangyin and take the money back to his hometown. The matter came to light, and yesterday the Hui Si Police Station dispatched detectives to Jiangyin to arrest Xu and bring him back to Shanghai. More than 10,000 yuan in banknotes were recovered and sent for interrogation. He was sentenced to six months in prison as a warning.</p>

<p>The home of Mr. Yu, a resident of 800 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, was broken into on the 10th, and clothing and cash worth more than 10,000 yuan were stolen. The French police have successively apprehended the robbers Xi Yousan, Wen Xiuming, Fang Yutao, Zhang Yixing, and suspected dancing girls Wang He'ying and Chen Cuie'e, totaling more than twenty men and women. They also apprehended Wang Bingquan, who supplied the firearms, at 11 Liang'an Villa on Yidingpan Road, and recovered three Mauser pistols, one handgun, more than a hundred rounds of ammunition, and stolen goods, which were taken back for investigation. Details have been reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now reported that some accomplices are still at large, and most of the stolen goods have not been recovered. Yesterday, the detectives in charge of the case began their investigation, summoning the victim to recover the stolen goods and arresting the remaining accomplices to bring them to justice.</p>

<p>Luo Zilin, from Shaoxing, and Jiufeng Xinji Silk Fabric Factory, etc., jointly established Huojin Hua Refinery at 222 Miller Road, Hongkou, and set up an office at 10 Lane 255, Shanxi Road, with Luo Zilin serving as manager. However, Zhang Yuqing, representing shareholder Jiufeng, suddenly reported to the Laozao Police Station, accusing Luo Zilin of selling soap and other goods worth 10,470 yuan without handing over the money, thereby embezzling public funds. The Chinese detective Liu Yukun arrested Luo, but according to Luo's statement, he also invested 7,000 yuan in the Dachunghua Factory and served as its manager. However, after the organization, it did not officially operate due to various reasons. As for selling soap and other goods, it was within his managerial authority, but because it has been almost a year and he has not been paid his salary, nor has he been provided with food, he temporarily diverted the proceeds from the sale of soap, but he had declared to the shareholders that it would be recorded in his name in the accounts, and there are accounts to prove it, so the allegation of embezzling public funds is completely untrue. According to the police statement, as the testimonies of both parties differed, an investigation should be conducted, so it was decided to investigate and verify before further action is taken.</p>

<p>After reading the article "Treat the Children of Others as Your Own" in your esteemed newspaper on the 4th, I was deeply moved. Although there are many child welfare organizations in Shanghai, there are still beggar children on the streets every day. Our colleagues at the hospital often talk to them and learn that they either have disabled parents or family members who depend on them for survival, or they are part of the "old beggar's education" group, so we cannot guide them into the hospital one by one, which is a great regret. As for the beggar mentioned in your newspaper who can only say "Little child, I'm starving to death" at the tram stop on Jinshenfu Road, if your organization or the author of the article can provide a letter of recommendation, our hospital is willing to admit him. In this difficult situation, our hospital has already limited the number of admissions, but on this Children's Day, our colleagues reread the article and were deeply moved. We intend to do our best to educate and care for this child. Our strength is insufficient to broadly help all the suffering children in the world, but we can reduce one child's suffering from hunger, which is just a small point on the thread mentioned in the article.

<h3 id="e61">Letter <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>To the editor: I am writing to you on behalf of my client, Mr. Wang Fanglan, who claims that a news item entitled "Shareholder of Western Clothing Store Accused of Abandoning Wife" was published on page 5 of the second section of the Shenbao on the 12th of this month. The content of the news item is largely inconsistent with the facts. When Jin Ziyun was a prostitute in Hankou and Yichang, Mr. Fanglan, who was doing business in Hankou, met her, which is true. However, they separated in the autumn of the 20th year of the Republic (1931). After that, Jin Ziyun's whereabouts were uncertain, sometimes in Shanghai and sometimes in Hankou. In the 24th year of the Republic (1935), after learning that Mr. Fanglan was in a good situation, she intended to extort money from him and came to harass him. Later, at the persuasion of a friend, they agreed to settle the matter. Jin Ziyun wrote a statement stating that she would permanently sever all ties and that they would no longer be involved with each other. It was also stated that the children born to Jin Ziyun had no blood relationship with Mr. Fanglan. Lawyer Li Ming was invited to the scene to clarify the matter, and a statement was published in the newspaper on August 29 of that year. With such written proof, there should have been no further disputes. However, Jin Ziyun's intentions were unpredictable. Last year, she falsely accused Mr. Fanglan of abandonment and made a false accusation to the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office. We were preparing to file a countersuit against her according to law, but Jin Ziyun acted shamelessly, begged for mercy, and even knelt down and pleaded with Mr. Fanglan's relatives to mediate. Out of respect for the advice of relatives, Mr. Fanglan gave her 300 yuan. Not long after, Jin Ziyun again asked relatives to intercede, and borrowed another 140 yuan. All of these facts are supported by written evidence signed by Jin Ziyun. However, Jin Ziyun's greed was insatiable. Not long after, she again used fabricated statements of abandonment to file a criminal complaint with the Shanghai Second Special District Court, hoping to intimidate. As a prostitute who had an encounter and lived together with him, she never obtained legal status, so how can there be any talk of abandonment in law? Moreover, Jin Ziyun had many male companions, and her children have no blood relationship with Mr. Fanglan. Since this has been stated in advance, legally there is no question whatsoever. Jin Ziyun is accustomed to using deceptive tricks to sue, intending to extort money, which is self-evident. We are currently suing Jin Ziyun for her illegal act of false accusation, and she will be punished by law in the future. There is no need to say more. However, we are concerned that the inaccuracy of the news report in your newspaper may lead to confusion. Therefore, we have no choice but to reveal the truth and ask for correction. We hereby entrust your esteemed lawyer to write a letter of statement and request a prompt correction to clarify the truth and prevent confusion. Respectfully addressed to the Shenbao Newspaper, Lawyer Jin Yu, April 13, 21st year of the Republic (1932). Yesterday our paper issued the report at 6:25.</p>
<h3 id="e62">The Employment Agency's Doorstep is Desolate, Female Domestic Workers are Easy to Hire, and Meals are Difficult to Obtain. The Trend of the Times Leads Young Masters and Mistresses to Take on the Tasks Themselves. Nannies are Powerless and Await Homeward Journeys. <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Before the war, even small families with only a husband and wife could afford to hire a nanny without being considered wasteful. If there was a fixed monthly income of over a hundred yuan, they might even hire a wet nurse when the first child joined the family group. Therefore, farmers near the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways preferred to entrust their farmland to others and come to Shanghai to "sit at employment agencies." The employment agencies in the French and International Concessions, as well as in the Nanshi and Zhabei districts, numbered as many as five hundred.</p>
<p>Now, the cost of food and clothing has increased tenfold to fiftyfold compared to before, and a salaried worker who is content and law-abiding, earning five times what they used to, is already considered "a lucky star." "Nannies" have naturally become a "problem." Speaking of nannies' wages, although they still hover around the ten-yuan mark, compared to before the war, they are only five times as much. (Wet nurses' wages are around fifty yuan, also five times as much.) This wage of thirty-three cents a day seems insignificant on a family's expenditure sheet, but the cost of feeding them is a headache. At the very least, a nanny's rice consumption costs at least one hundred yuan.</p>
<p>Someone once said: "We really can't afford a nanny, but it seems we have to hire one to mill rice. However, eight-tenths of the rice milled each day ends up in her stomach. A dilemma, a dilemma!"</p>
<p>A month ago, the nearly ten employment agencies near my home were filled with nannies and older women. Recently, the owner's wives are playing mahjong in the shops. Where have these nannies and older women, waiting to be sold, gone? The old owners are shaking their heads, indicating that there is no room for development in their industry. It is said that nannies specializing in a "specific skill" still have a way out, such as those who can serve grandmothers and wives, specialize in ironing Western clothes, or cook delicious dishes. They are in demand in large mansions. The so-called "servants are like clouds," and the "prestige" of these large mansions is greater now than in the past.</p>
<p>Ordinary nannies are called "rough workers." A "rough worker" can do everything, but nothing expertly. In the past, small families needed this kind of "one-size-fits-all" nanny. Now, young masters and mistresses are taking on the tasks themselves. As a result, the "one-size-fits-all" nannies have also "kicked" their way back to their hometowns.</p>
<p>The procedures for hiring a nanny through an employment agency have recently changed, and it is worth mentioning.</p>
<p>In the past, giving the "delivery man" ten copper coins when sending a nanny was considered very polite. Now, giving forty cents is not considered too little, but it's not enough for "ironing." After the three-day "trial" period, the employment agency comes to "collect wages." Their referral fee is: according to the size of the salary, the employer pays twenty cents per yuan, called "upfront money"; the nanny pays ten cents per yuan, called "downstream money." For example, if the salary is three yuan, the employer gives sixty cents, and the nanny gives thirty cents. In addition, there is an additional "guarantee" of twenty cents. Now, the "upfront money" is eighty cents per yuan, the "downstream money" is thirty cents per yuan, and the "guarantee" is one yuan.</p>
<p>Recently, nannies from cohabitating families often introduce their fellow villagers. The wages are relatively cheaper, and you can save the "upfront money" of almost a month's salary. Some even only ask for food, not wages. This seems to be a "nanny bargain." However, whether a family hires a nanny or not is not determined by the difference of a few yuan. The biggest problem is that rice is too expensive, and where can you get rice!</p>
<p>At the same time, there are reasons for selling labor at a "bargain price." Nannies need to eat every day, even if they are not the "fixed-brand soap" that cannot be sold. If you count two meals a day, it costs at least five yuan, right? Then, "sitting" at an employment agency for a week without being "placed" means three months of work for nothing. You also have to sleep at night, and it is said that you have to pay fifty cents per night to stay at the employment agency. Therefore, rather than hoping for tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, it is better to use the daily "living expenses" as travel expenses and return home! (Ping)</p>

All the Chinese teams will be participating. The first match is between the White Team and the Giants. The former is a strong Chinese team with famous players such as Cheng Shining and Xi Shiyin. The latter is not weak either. The two teams are evenly matched. The second match is between Aurora and Peide. Peide is a better team, and Aurora will likely have difficulty blunting its attack. The final Group A match is between the Russian Emigres and the Soviets. In the first match, the Russian Emigres reversed the defeat with a score of 3-2. Tickets are one yuan. Today's schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>White Team vs. Giants (Group B) 6:00 PM</p>
<p>Aurora vs. Peide (Group B) 6:20 PM</p>
<p>Russian Emigres vs. Soviets (Group A) 7:00 PM</p>

<h3 id="e66">Uniformed A Bonds Drawn as Scheduled, Repayments Total Forty-Four Numbers Drawn. <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gray market for public bonds was clearly controlled by one entity. Before Da Kang Cheng arrived on the market, various groups were successively covering their short positions slightly, not daring to make large-scale moves and remaining cautious. The market price then recovered slightly. After entering the market, when Class C bonds rose by almost one yuan, Da Kang Cheng came again to dump them. The astute ones took the initiative and sold first. Da Kang Cheng dumped another four or fifty hundred thousand yuan, mostly Class D and E bonds, less of Class C, and a limited amount of Class B, which was almost completely sold. There were no Class A bonds. This outflow of physical bonds was largely supported by Yi Tai and Tong Kang, who bought a lot. However, Class C bonds had already broken through the sixty-yuan mark. At the close, Jiu Fu and Yi Tai supported the price. Many others took advantage of the situation to short sell. Jiu Feng and Hong Xing still mainly held physical bonds. Shun Li, Lian Yi, Tong Li, Shun Tai, Wu He, Shun Heng, Xin Feng, and Qian Yi mostly took the opportunity to short sell. However, Tong Kang and Yi Tai bought a lot. Gong Mao, Tong Shun, Bao Long, Hong Da, Jiu Fu, Hu Heji, Xin Ji, and Yu Xing all bought on dips, but whether they can bear a few yuan increase in the market price is a question. Although the market price has fallen sharply, people are not panicked. It is only unknown when those who are being squeezed can be relieved. As a result, it continued to fall by a small six jiao to one yuan and nine jiao, with a turnover of about one hundred and twenty hundred thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Change from Previous Day</p>
<p>Despite the market situation, the future is still not hopeless. The thirteenth repayment drawing of the Republic of China 25th Year Uniformed A Bonds was held on February 10th in Chongqing. A total of forty-four three-digit numbers were drawn: 013, 033, 076, 099, 116, 126, 160, 200, 205, 210, 214, 254, 257, 304, 342, 343, 370, 398, 449, 453, 459, 461, 499, 503, 514, 525, 570, 651, 654, 669, 683, 747, 777, 779, 790, 794, 812, 823, 828, 889, 963, 966, 976, 990. Each number will be repaid 150,000 national currency, totaling 6.6 million national currency. Both the repayments and the thirteenth period interest coupons will be paid by the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications on July 31st of this year.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Spot Gold Transactions Very Rare <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot gold market saw a decline. Recently, military notes have fallen, and the gold shops have been selling hundreds of taels, so even if external clients buy, they have to buy at a low price. As a result, the market is soft. In the morning, the initial transaction price per bar (10 taels) was still 18,700 yuan. The gold shops selling led to a decline of 400 yuan. At 11:30 AM, the lowest price traded was 18,200 yuan, but it quickly rebounded by 100 yuan. At noon, buyers offered 18,400 yuan, a small decrease of 3 yuan from the previous day's final transaction price.</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry per tael in Da Xin and other shops was still 1,950 yuan (deducting 200 yuan for purchases). Silver bars were priced at 18 yuan, and the black market price was 13.67 yuan. Silver coins also slightly decreased to 8.12 yuan. Transactions were still rare.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Head Discounts Also Low <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate of the Shanghai Bankers' Association remained at 7%. The discount rate for head bills initially was 38 yuan per 1,000 yuan, then fell to around 30 yuan at the end, down 7-8 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Military Notes Circling <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange market saw no movement in British and American gold pounds. The former was 432 yuan, and the latter was 440 yuan. American notes were slightly firm, priced at 33 yuan. Hong Kong notes continued to rise to 4 yuan, with large notes decreasing by a small jiao.

<h3 id="e72">Cotton Yarn Speculation Slightly Active at the Close <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market turned weaker. This was because credit was tighter, and some bulls were selling and becoming more relaxed. 42-count Blue Phoenix was 9,510 yuan to 9,350 yuan, the closing price was 9,440 yuan. 20-count Blue Phoenix was 5,130 yuan, 20-count Water Moon was 4,975 yuan, 20-count Harvest was 4,975 yuan, 20-count Moon Harp was 4,600 yuan, 42-count Yang Crane was 9,500 yuan, 16-count Red Kui Star was 4,700 yuan to 4,600 yuan, 8-count Three Tiger was 3,650 yuan, 60-count Color Ball was 20,900 yuan to 700 yuan, 60-count Five Sons was 20,000 yuan, 32-count Immortal Peach was 9,730 yuan, 32-count Flying Tiger was 7,900 yuan, 40-count Color Ball was 9,060 yuan, 30-count Double Horse was 4,690 yuan, 20-count Double Tiger was 5,100 yuan, 20-count Flying Swan was 4,480 yuan, 23-count Golden Rooster was 4,720 yuan, 10-count Red Double Horse was 3,670 yuan, 10-count Boy Scout was 3,640 yuan, 20-count Double Horse factory orders initially opened at 3,690 yuan, then gradually rose to 3,750 yuan due to good sentiment. This was due to the activity of speculators and was entirely due to the tightness of funds, without any basis. It hovered around 3,700 yuan for quite some time. Near the close, it slowly rose to 3,775 yuan, closing at a high price.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Eastern Cloth Initially Down, Then Up <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>

<h3 id="e74">Rain Makes Rice More Expensive, Retail Rice Also Rises <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The retail prices of foreign rice and broken rice sold by the Public Works Department will rise again starting today. Foreign rice is 2.2 yuan per liter in Central Reserve Bank notes, and 2.9 yuan per liter in legal tender. Broken rice is 1.9 yuan per liter in Central Reserve Bank notes, and 2.5 yuan in legal tender.</p>
<p>Although national rice is available but not traded, itinerant vendors often adjust their prices according to changes in the weather. Yesterday, there was rain day and night, the roads were muddy, and it was difficult to travel. The vendors were worried about the rice getting wet, so there were few vendors, and the prices were high. It is rumored that early and late rice in the French Concession was sold at 405 yuan to 400 yuan per liter, and in the British Concession at 425 yuan to 427 yuan, an increase of nearly ten yuan. Although it is impossible to confirm whether these prices are true, the rise and fall of this elusive rice price is so great that it is chilling. Fortunately, the sale of cheap foreign rice is widespread, which is a small help to the general public, and the price of rice in the urban area is even lower, which is even more fortunate.</p>
<h3 id="e75">The Recent Reason for the Sharp Fall in Cigarettes <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The price of cigarettes has fallen sharply in recent days, and the market price was slightly stable yesterday. This is because general new speculators are absorbing them at low prices, resulting in brisk sales, but the reality is still sluggish. The rise and fall are all due to the manipulation of speculators, and the future is rather bleak. Yesterday, the opening prices of various brands rose and fell. The Big British brand was 9,700 yuan per carton, up 500 yuan from the previous day. Old Knife brand was 8,100 yuan, Little Fairy brand was 5,600 yuan, and Five Flowers brand was 5,500 yuan, all down 100 yuan. The rise and fall of Japanese cigarettes were mixed. Gold Gun brand was 2,500 yuan, up 300 yuan. Gold Building was 2,400 yuan, Red Rose was 1,950 yuan, Full Record brand was 2,750 yuan, and Guide brand was 2,200 yuan.</p>
<p>The reason why the price of cigarettes has fallen sharply is that the previous rise was too strong, which is also rare. Even the worst cigarettes cost at least one yuan for ten cigarettes, which ultimately makes those who love to smoke turn back. In addition, food and other essential living items are not only expensive but also difficult to obtain. The consumption of cigarettes will inevitably decrease. The number of merchants has decreased, transportation is dangerous, the value of the goods is too high, and there is no profit to be made in the countryside. Credit is tight, and the interest rate on drafts is high. The military's sale of cigarettes in the port continues, causing the general industry to decline, and the market is sluggish, causing the general internal and external speculators to be less active. The speculators have accumulated goods, because the market is weakening day by day, and the monsoon season is not far away. It is difficult to sell them to other ports, so they have to be retailed.</p>

<h3 id="e76">A Study on the Clutter of Dialogue <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— Tao Shunsheng</p>
<p>During the Spring Festival, since I couldn't go sightseeing like in the past, I thought it would be more interesting to watch a play or two than to flip through books at home. Recently, Shanghai's plays seem to be developing, and although new scripts are still rare, many new actors have entered the scene. After watching a few famous plays during the Spring Festival, I thought I would say a few casual words about the delivery of dialogue by general actors. Of course, these words are not worth reading for famous actors, right?</p>
<p>When an actor is on stage, if he (or she) wants to convey the central idea and plot of the script to the audience, in addition to acting, he must rely on the recitation of his dialogue. Reciting dialogue should be an important step, but some actors cannot do it well. This may be because they lack a little attention and training in sound and pronunciation, so that sometimes the sharp and round sounds are not distinguished, and the length, pitch, loudness, and weight of the voice are not distributed naturally, destroying the beauty of the dialogue and the performance of the play.</p>
<p>Inaccurate sound can be caused by three reasons:</p>
<p>Habit - Each place has its own local accent. After getting used to it, the vocal organs often form a special form in order to facilitate the pronunciation of the local accent, which hinders accurate pronunciation. - This is not difficult to correct as long as you try to correct the position of the vocal organs through practice. For example, speaking standard Mandarin in a stiff way is not beautiful on stage.</p>
<p>Physiological - Leaky teeth are easy to fix, but short or thick tongues and inflexible vocal cords are more difficult to deal with.</p>
<p>Psychological - If an accident occurs temporarily after the actor takes the stage, causing panic and wrong pronunciation - this can be forgiven, but it is best for the actor himself and the stage director to pay attention beforehand.</p>
<p>As for the differentiation of pronunciation, unless the actor has a natural physiological defect, it is always easy. If the director can give some guidance during rehearsals, it will have a great effect.</p>
<p>In short, actors must work hard to train their voice and tone, study the pronunciation of words, and humbly accept other people's opinions. Experience, aptitude, knowledge level, and emotions are also conditions that determine pronunciation. With an artistic voice, dialogue can then be recited flexibly.</p>
<p>Of course, a talented actor does not rely solely on his voice or reciting dialogue, but on his various achievements and continuous efforts.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Jackie Cooper as a Private <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— New Movie</p>
<p>Jackie Cooper was known throughout the world as a child star in Hollywood. He was once hailed as Hollywood's only child star after Jackie Coogan and before Michel Ray. In the beginning, his fame was indeed no less than that of Jackie Coogan, Michel Ray, and others. Six or seven years ago, when you mentioned the name Jackie Cooper, every movie fan knew it. It's just that in recent years, his age has grown, and he has lost his status as a child star in an instant, so we rarely see him on the screen now, and he looks somewhat unfamiliar.</p>
<p>When we recall that seven or eight years ago, when we talked about child stars, we would immediately think of Jackie Cooper, and at that time, movie fans who loved to watch child star movies always wanted to see movies starring Jackie Cooper. During that period, Jackie Cooper starred in many movies, especially "Divorcee's Son" and "Treasure Island," which still leave us with a deep impression.</p>
<p>Time passes so quickly, especially since the years of child stars are very short. In an instant, Jackie Cooper has grown up and is a young man in his twenties. After the United States joined the war, it widely recruited soldiers. Male movie stars in Hollywood were no exception, so the number of movie stars drafted in the past few months has been quite large. According to a telegram from Hollywood on the 5th, Jackie Cooper recently received an order from his superiors to draft him into the army as a private. From then on, Jackie Cooper will completely leave the film industry and live a military life, which is something that general movie fans would not have expected.</p>

<p>— Fact and Fiction</p>
<p>Gao Zhanfei has returned to Shanghai. When asked about Bai Yang, Lao Gao replied that the reports were exaggerated. This probably belongs to the category of "there is a cause, but no evidence." Lao Gao's demeanor is as good as ever. He has a small mustache and seems more handsome than some "romantic young men."</p>
<p>Lao Gao claims that he has not been home, but he has met with Gao Qianpin. Outsiders have no way of knowing whether there are any legal procedures.</p>
<p>Lao Gao's first film after returning to Shanghai is "Lin Zexu."</p>
<p>Shu Shi and Murong Wan'er became enthusiastic after playing "Xiang Yu the Conqueror," and finally held a wedding ceremony at Huanlong the day before yesterday. Shu Shi's wife is a virtuous woman who "forgave" the "evidence" matter.</p>
<p>The introducer was Yao Ke, the screenwriter of "Xiang Yu the Conqueror," which can be said to be a "suitable candidate."</p>
<p>This ceremony was kept secret beforehand and not publicized afterward. Ordinary friends could not attend, - and the reporter was one of them.</p>
<p>Yan Jun and Mei Cun, who announced their marriage last December, gave birth to a son the day before yesterday. This is not Xiao Yan Jun, who was "pregnant for ten months." Commentators called it "sneaking out of bounds."</p>
<p>Yan Jun has a role in "Spring." His wife gave birth, so he could only worry on stage, but he was full of spring breeze and quite proud. It is also heard that Xiao Hanfei intends to be the godfather, and a celebratory ceremony will be held around the one-month mark.</p>
<p>Game Musings</p>
<h3 id="e79">Chess <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— Ze Fu</p>
<p>The game of chess, some say it originated with Emperor Wu of the Zhou Dynasty (this Emperor Wu refers to Emperor Wu of the Northern Zhou Dynasty; recent people have mistakenly thought it was King Wu of the Zhou Dynasty), but that is not actually the case. The elephant game created by Emperor Wu of Zhou is completely different from the system of chess. According to the continued Buddhist scriptures and the records of successive generations of Zen Master Nianchang, under Emperor Wenzong's reign of Kaicheng (836 AD), there is an entry "Made Chess," with an original note saying: "In the past, Shennong used the sun, moon, stars, and zodiac signs as symbols; Prime Minister Niu Sengru of the Tang Dynasty used chariots, horses, generals, and soldiers, and added cannons to replace them as a mechanism." This "mechanism" should be a mistake for the word "chess." Therefore, the game of chess actually originated with Niu Sengru. Niu wrote a book called "Xuan Guai Lu," in which one section, "Cen Shun," records the movements of chess at that time, but does not mention the number of paths. There is no "elephant" in the chess, and the two armies are called Tianna and Jinxiang. It was not until the Northern Song Dynasty that it was known that the roads were eleven, the chess pieces were thirty-two, and the two armies were called Chu and Han. Cheng's poem about the elephant game says, "Heroes like Liu and Xiang also compete idly." However, there was still no "elephant" but "pian" and "bi." It was not until the Southern Song Dynasty that Liu Kezhuang wrote a poem about the elephant game, saying, "Kunyang rushed with elephants," and then there was an "elephant" in the chess, but no "pian" or "bi." It can be seen that the "elephant" actually came from the combination of "pian" and "bi," and the cannon was originally in the rear, but then it was placed in the front. Therefore, the eleven roads were also changed to nine roads, and the division in the middle was also called the Great River, all completely the same as the current system. Therefore, the game of chess actually originated in the Tang Dynasty and was completed in the Song Dynasty. As for its name "elephant," it refers to the meaning of an elephant formation, not because there is an elephant in the chess that it has this name.</p>
<p>The introducer was Yao Ke, the screenwriter of "Chu Overlord," which can be said to be a "suitable choice."</p>
<p>This ceremony was kept secret before the event and was not extravagant afterwards. Ordinary friends were not able to attend the event personally - the reporter was one of them. Yan Houmei, who announced her marriage last December, gave birth to a son the day before yesterday. This is not Xiao Yan Jun who was "pregnant for ten months"; commentators call it "stealing a kick."</p>
<p>Yan Jun has a role in "Spring," and his wife's childbirth can only make him anxious on stage, but he is full of smiles and quite proud. It is also heard that Little Han Fei intends to be the godfather, and the "seeing the gift" ceremony is scheduled to be held on the occasion of the baby's first month.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Reflections After Seeing "Narcissus" <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yin</p>
<p>"Narcissus" is being performed at the Lyceum, and it has been two weeks since it started on March 30th. The attendance is so high that it has set a new record for plays performed at the Lyceum. The external discussions can also be said to be "universally appreciated and unanimously praised," so there is no need for me to say more. However, after seeing it, I really have too many feelings, and I can't help but write a little about it, as a reference for those who have already seen it, and as an introduction for those who have not seen it.</p>
<p>The theme of this play is very serious. It depicts several strong characters, such as Ouyang Yingxian, who is willing to accept imperfection, and Jin Guangqing, who has lofty ambitions. These can be said to be figures worthy of everyone's admiration.</p>
<p>The characterization is clear and vivid, the layout is meticulous, the transitions are natural, there is acting everywhere, and one step leads to another - these are the advantages of this play. The beauty of the scenes, the elegance of the dialogue - and some of the dialogues are very poetic, the full use of lighting - lighting fires - these are the smaller advantages of this play.</p>
<p>Ruoqing changed her previous style this time, playing a young girl of eighteen or nineteen, innocent and lovely, unexpectedly successful. Zhao Hua's Tao Yinan played it vividly, grasping the emotions in the play and giving full play to them. He is truly a rare male actor. The other actors, such as Liu Lian's Wei Mary, with her graceful and natural demeanor and clear and pleasant pronunciation, Wu Jing's Old Mrs. Yu, with her just right status, Chen Yulin's Jin Guangqing, with his serious attitude and beautiful appearance, and Chen Youxin's Mei Zheji, writing out the true colors of a bad lawyer, are all very competent.</p>
<p>The colleagues of China Arts Theater believe that "Narcissus" is the most significant contribution of the company in the past year, and I believe it deserves it.</p>

<p>— Bing Lin</p>
<p>"Sun Shangxiang's Sacrifice to the River" was originally the signature play of the Qingyi master Chen Delin. Since Chen's death, the only one who can inherit his mantle is Huang Guiqiu. Guiqiu plays Shangxiang, and his appearance and movements are very similar to the famous Huang Yulin, and his white mouth imitates Mei's is extremely lifelike. The duet with the Empress Dowager in the "Other Palace" is fluent and lively, the pitch is appropriate, and the tempo is appropriate, like a stream in the deep mountains. The final scene of sacrificing to the river is the essence of the whole play. The Erhuang Daoban "At the Riverbank" uses high-pitched phrases, which are very taxing on the voice. Nowadays, many famous Dan regard it as a daunting task, but only Guiqiu can do it, which is especially precious. The large passage of Fan Erhuang is pleasant and moving, and it is truly rare.</p>

<p>(3) Guests Arrive</p>
<p>The New Year belongs to others, not the Ye family of Shide Hall. On the evening of the fourth day of the Lunar New Year, the merchants in Huagang were setting off firecrackers, which intermittently reached Weicheng's ears. Weicheng and the Second Mrs. Ye were sitting under the lamp, and the sad clouds on their faces had not yet been dispelled. Some greasy stains were on the front of Weicheng's cotton robe. The Second Mrs. Ye said, "Is there any of the stain remover you brought back last time?" Weicheng said, "I don't know." The Second Mrs. Ye said, "Just now your Great Uncle came, and he still agrees with the Qin family's method. This matter is over, and it can't be done even if you want to." The Second Mrs. Ye's words seemed to be a tentative nature, while speaking, she was looking at Weicheng's expression. Weicheng said, "Uncle, Great Uncle, their thinking is wrong." Just as he was speaking, there was a knock on the door outside. The Second Mrs. Ye called Magpie, but Magpie did not go out. A Xing had already opened the door and led Huang Long in.</p>
<p>Huang Long was carrying a lantern in his hand, wearing a black cloth sheepskin robe, and a black silk belt around his waist. As soon as he entered the door, he grabbed Weicheng's hand, and then greeted the Second Mrs. Ye, saying, "Brother Weicheng must be bored to death at home, you go with me somewhere. Come on, I specially hired a car to pick you up, the car is outside." Weicheng said, "Where is it?" Huang Long said, "I wouldn't possibly come to kidnap you, Second Aunt must be very relieved too." Weicheng said, "I can't go, let go." The Second Mrs. Ye said, "Huang Long, even if you want Weicheng to go, you have to explain where it is and what's going on." Huang Long put the lantern on the table and smiled, "I'm at the Guanyin Temple, Second Aunt and Brother Weicheng already know. Tonight, people are welcoming the God of Wealth, I am welcoming my Brother Weicheng. Because I received a ham and two chickens sent by someone there, and bought some things, I wanted to put together a table of wine and food to eat. I came here especially to invite you, there's nothing else. (50)</p>
<p>The picture above shows Mr. Wang Shaoqing, who used to play the erhu for Mei Lanfang and is now the erhu player for Huang Jinxin's leading role, Li Shifang. It is heard that Mr. Wang is coming south this time, and he has also invited his disciple, Ni Qiuping, a famous Shanghai opera lover who plays the erhu. The teacher and student will cooperate and try out new voices for the first time. There should be countless beautiful tunes and wonderful performances presented to the opera fans and enthusiasts.</p>
