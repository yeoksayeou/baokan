<p>— 熟客</p>
<p>東西二角有二個大餐室，經特別設訓：一個叫古代廳，裝置用具，完全古色古香；一個叫現代廳，完全流綫式，是范又照建築師與吳漢民工程師所紋盡腦汁的作品。吳工程師爲現代作品建築師中之新進優秀人材，作品崇尚在簡單綫條中抽的美的點數，尤注意極細微處的歸納能目圓其說。你能在全新都飯店中，有很多特殊的筆法的動都還有西廂小座，西庙，這個名詞怪可愛的，聽說新都將來還有一只名菜，也將叫做「會少離多。」造倒可稱兩艷。西廂，據說是供給專鬥尋求異性安慰者的小酌之處，在兩邊，往來無白丁，可以談談情，光綫旣好，坐位叉舒適，而尤其自雷梯出來，可母須經大廳廣衆之下，而逕入西廂的；比夕於常年張生須越高稿，不知要幸福多少了。</p>
<h3 id="c50">藝術化科學化 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>全部沙發餐椅，羊毛地毯，令銀餐具，式形是完全超脫舊樣的。色澤又極合藝術的條件。選料旣極高貴，因此，比之於一般人家只知把紅綠顏色的東西搬了上來，就算「富麓堂皇」，那是不可同日而語了。各處怖置盆景，由時花專家卡德路「香雪園」主人周瘦鵑氏設計。音樂，據說將來除選好旋律的爵士音樂外，每週間或有古典音樂音獻給顧客。那又是一種特殊點。還有油書是盡家方雪鴣的著作。</p>
<p>除了這些，記者還須特別提出幾點，是該飯店實行科學管理，每間餐房的　鈴，都有直綫通管理處，倘客人第三次撳鈴而侍者不進來，管理處的該號紅燈就亮了，有這方法管理，侍者就不敢偷懶，還有，直接裝有通話筒到廚房，可以隨時催菜。</p>
<p>電話，每間大房都有，全店有機十五只，並每房間附有衣帽間，這恐怕又是全滬酒菜館的新紀錄了。當然有這樣多電話機，各部份也易於實行科學管理了。</p>
<p>菜譜，除廣東菜外，還有四川菜，寗波菜，與蘇州菜。至於菜燒得快否，據李君說，他限制每只常備菜在客人點就後七分鏡內端到客人的面前</p>
<h3 id="c51">菜館史上的傑作 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>總之，新的新都飯店，動昌了十幾位的專家，經四個月的籌備，化了三百萬元的儲鈔，所給與我們的觀感，委實不凡。我們若說狀元樓，鴻運樓，之類在酒英館的發展史中是屬於第一期的，由味雅至新雅京華紅棉等是屬於第二期的，那麽新都應該屬於第三期的第一件作品。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c61">「郎德山的技術」 <a href="#c61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— 洛綠</p>
<p>技衛家郎德山，這次重與滬人相見，在大光明演出，眞不營是使上海人的眼睛在這「全市如沸」的盛夏下吃了次冰淇淋，究竟是上海人的眼輻，久開其名的人們，誰不想去觀光一下。</p>
<p>這一次的演出，是和新萬花團合作，但表演節目仍各自獨立，所謂合作者，只不過是那班萬花團的樂隊在郎德山節目演出時在旁吹吹敲敲罷了。</p>
<p>寓花團歌舞完畢後，休息了十分鐘，就是郎德山上塲，臺幕第二次拉開的時候，後面的慕布巳換上了一幅古色古香，大紅底白繡的太和殿的圖案，强烈的燈光打在上面，益發　得美麗悅目。郎德山氏穿着古式中國大袍，兩手牽着着潘氏姊妹笑容可掬地步向臺前。第一套表演的是中國魔術「燒帶還原」，雖然這種魔稱，大家巳是看慣了的，但在郎氏演來，還是精采百出，而兩旁執帶的兩個美女——潘氏姊妹，更是使郎氏的演出，有錦上添花之妙。</p>
<p>魔術完畢，郎氏脫去了大袍，內穿白緞黑絲繡的中國式短衣，親自指揮「郎家班」的技術長演。第一固表寅的是「粵盆」的技衛，一個小姑娘兩手拿了兩根短棒，棒上頂了兩只旋轉不停的盆子。手裏拿了這些東西，身體還在做戲：從櫈上翻到地下，再兩手交又着從地下翻上櫈去，更在額上放了兩杯水而向後翻下去，舞動了十聲分鐘，而兩手所拿的棒上頂着的盆子，還是不斷地旋轉着，始終沒有跌下來，博得了觀衆們熱烈地掌聲。那個小姑娘年紀至多不過十三四歲，臉蛋兒生得怪可愛的，梳了兩根小辮子，而表演時臉部的表情始終是笑嘻嘻地。接着表演的有大力士，舞鋼又等等？而中間穿揰着幾個潘氏姊妹的表演。</p>
<p>潘玉珍玉蘭的演技最博得觀衆春雷似的掌聲的要算「扯鈴」跟「舞傘」了。扯鈴時起先是兩個人單獨扯：丟上，落下，向背上滾過，由褲下穿過等等絕技，接着是一個人扯兩個鈴，兩個人交換扯等，座旁的一個外國人，看得目瞪口呆不住地點頭。</p>
<p>郎德山是中國北方人（他的太太是法國人）但久留外國，他的中國話倒變成有些「洋涇洪」，表演時的說明英語居多，國語次之，間有日語。他所訓練出的種種技術，確是使人欽佩的。</p>

<p>— 嵐影</p>
<p>旣然藍蘭也在夏霞家裏，我當然不肯放過她的。所以上次與夏霞談了一回後，我又與藍蘭談了片刻。</p>
<p>「孫先生是在重慶嗎？你很想他吧！」</p>
<p>「還好！也可以說很想，也可以說不很想。兩個人分開着各人做各人的事，比在一起無所事事要有意思得多。原來「快樂是在不停的工作裹，」不是嗎？說眞的，不和氣的兩個人，雖然天天在一起也不會好的；兩個人天生要好，即使各自一方。實際上總歸是要好的。想與不想，反正一樣。」</p>
<p>「你的七個女人」？）寫得怎麽樣了？」「——我現在在改編「魂斷藍橋」，巴經差不多了。」</p>
<p>「你眞能幹，編，演，導，樣樣都來！」</p>
<p>「在劇本，人才都缺少的時候，我覺得能够寫的人，應該試試寫寫，成績的好壞，可以不必計較。」</p>
<p>她身上穿的是一套西裝，據說是因爲當天有跳舞課，我於是想到服裝的問題；「你以爲演員的服裝與戲有重大的關係嗎？」</p>
<p>「我覺得服裝的顏色與質地往往很可以幫助演員表達人物的個性，雖然也有人以爲有了優秀的演技，可以不必注意服裝的美惡。」</p>
<p>「你喜歡管家務嗎？」</p>
<p>「如果能够內外兼顧，當然最好；要不然，我情願演戲，對於我，舞台比家庭合式。」</p>
<p>「你在燕京大零念的希文學系鐵？」</p>
<p>「不，是心理學系，當初我到上海未加入劇團從事戲劇工作，完全是偶然的。然而，現在，我却覺得心理學對於一個演員倒是很有好處。」</p>
<p>她住在薩坡賽路，可是夏霞說：「你們要找她，可以到我這裹來找　她在我這裹的時候多，在她自已家裹的時候少。」</p>

<p>言菊朋物故後，一代小生宗匠之程繼先又以逝世聞。按前者楊嘉訓（小樓）去世時，一時盛傳繼先亦相繼而沒，一般報章雜誌，多所記載，嗣幸傳聞失實，該伶實則無恙，去歲且與嘯伯偕來，紅氍毺上，得以重見程老身手。雖老態日增，而典型所在，舉手投足，俱合分寸。繼先爲大老板程長庚之孫，幼時坐科於小榮椿科班，與小樓有同窗之誼。嗣在恭親王府任事，得五品頂戴，升至兵部員外郎。民初俞振庭統領變慶社，邀其加入，與徐（蝶仙王（楞仙有「三仙」之稱。去歲其來滬時，會聆其鞏英會，狀元譜等劇，不意竟成永訣。其兄名少棠，官至中書，受知於李文忠公，民初在外交部爲僉事，能通四國言語云。</p>
<p>以配角老生而成正角者凡三人，即高慶奎李嗚玉貫盛習是也。高爲盛麟世壽之父，成名之後，於各派各調，兼收並蓄，致有不純之譏。李爲鳴盛和科班出身，取法劉跛（鴻聲）。貫係富連成三科生，與大元盛吉，俱屬昆弟行，昔隨遏雲世來等蒞滬時，尚爲掃邊老生，雖然，演劇頗能賣力，雁門關之六郎，穆桂英之延昭（唱斬子一段），皆爲顧曲老所稱道，故其在毛五班中時，有壓倒沙世鑫之勢，自返京後，更努力不報，已一躍而爲二牌老生，李世芳張君秋章遏雲皆喜邀其爲配。甚盼盛習能不驕不惰，則他日再度來申時，滬上人仕，亦當括自相看矣。</p>
<p>前報上有紀玉良李麓華結合之說，已經本報闢謠，惟因此而憶及其先人李桂芳。桂芳之父名雅仙，習靑衣，桂芳幼年間以二印子之藝名，專工　生，嗣改小生，爲楊榮壽名弟子之一，唱做扮相均佳，久居滬濱，京伶南下者，皆喜攜之爲配，其妻張少泉，亦即李麗華之母也。</p>
<p>楊小樓之藝術，雖由楊熒壽之薰陶不少，而其三十六友之功，亦不可沒。蓋小樓篤信道敎，以致於武工藝衛方面，反見生疏，幸由其友人茹錫九何佩亭輩共三十六人，每日促其共同練習，始免荒怠。武生劇有曹家樓者，即五面枷，亦稱三十六友，兩者相映，亦云巧矣。錫九乃名琴師茹萊卿之子，富蘭之父；佩亭係武凈何桂山之子，俱屬伶界之後者也。</p>

<p>— 直輿</p>
<p>人不能離藝衛而獲得美滿之生活。藝術是振奮提高人之精神思想，涵濡薰陶人之性情氣質，而推進文化以求人類進步的耍素；世界文明各國對於藝術一事無不竭力提倡，而德，法，俄，之戲劇尤稱卓越，我國積數千年之敎化，於戲劇一道亦有獨到而值得官揚之處，自梅蘭芳博士歐遊以後，於是中國「寫意派」戲劇乃益爲舉世所矚目了。</p>
<p>戲劇之目的原在「移風易俗」，「正樂化育」然而一般沾染梨園習氣的舊式科班出身的伶人，大都並未負起此項責任來，時代是進步的，現在我們應該摒除一切偏見及誤解，積極發揮戲劇使命，提高中國戲劇的身價，使其成爲改造社會，開拓民智，適應時代的有價值的藝術。</p>
<p>上海戲劇學校就是本此原則而產生的，他們拾舊式科班之短而兼採新制學校之長，創辦至今，雖然祗有兩年多，然而成續已斐然可觀了，公演二百八十一次，上過一次銀幕，拍了一部「古中國之歌」。</p>
<p>筆者爲了希望知道戲校兩年來的情形所以在二十日上午到戲校去作了一次巡禮：</p>
<p>踏進大門看見走廊上舖着厚厚的毯子，有十幾個裸着上身淌着汗珠的男孩子在練習觔斗，走上樓梯是一個大禮堂，壁上掛了許多社會名流梨園名伶贈送的匾額。承該校敎務長關鴻賓君慇勒招待，就在辦公室中展開了我們的談話：——</p>
<p>據關先生說：「戲校在創辦的時候，是不望有今天的，經過兩年多的苦幹，　路藍縷，終算不負我們創辦的一番苦心，當時登報招生來投考的約有四五百人，鏗過嚴格的老試以後，錄取二百四十餘人，現在這二百四十多個學生大部份已能登臺演唱，祗有二十多個學生還不能登裏，將來也要給他們一個登臺實習的機會」。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Zymlyansk Area: German and Soviet Forces in a Tug-of-War; Situation Still Urgent in Lower Don Region; German Forces Advance Toward Volga River <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Haitong Press, Berlin, 28th - The German military communique this afternoon stated: "The bridgehead established near Rostov after crossing the Don River has been significantly expanded through our efforts. Infantry and mechanized units east of the city have crossed the Don River, reaching areas such as Mangye and Sal. Northwest of the Kala district, battles continue. German and allied forces south of the city have landed after crossing the Don River in the lower reaches. Key Soviet transportation routes and air force bases are being bombed day and night by German aircraft. Fifty-three enemy aircraft have been shot down. Several Volga River cargo ships have been sunk, and several freight trains have been hit and damaged. South of Rostov, German aircraft are destroying the enemy forces resisting. Soviet forces in the Voronezh area have suffered significant losses in manpower and materiel, and did not launch a large-scale offensive yesterday. Enemy forces trapped in the central sector, in addition to those captured, have mostly been annihilated. Enemy forces attacking the bridgehead in the Volkhov area were ultimately repelled after fierce fighting."</p>
<p>Allied Press, Bern, 28th - German forces in southern Soviet Union are advancing towards the lower Volga River in two directions. One route is about fifty miles from Stalingrad, and the other is advancing ten miles south from the Don River. Their destination is likely the wealthy Caucasus region. Soviet newspapers acknowledge that the situation in the lower Don River region, spanning three hundred miles, remains very urgent.</p>
<p>Allied Press, Lisbon, 28th - Reportedly, German and Soviet forces are engaged in a tank battle in the Zymlyansk area on the southern bank of the lower Don River. The two armies are advancing and retreating, resulting in a tug-of-war. However, the Soviet side acknowledges that the Red Army has slightly retreated from that area. The Red Army's flank has been severely threatened since German forces occupied Rostov and Novocherkassk.</p>
<p>Havas, Stockholm, 28th - It has been a month since German forces launched their summer offensive in southern Soviet Union. German and Soviet forces currently have hundreds of thousands of soldiers and thousands of aircraft engaged in combat south of Rostov. The German objective is Krasnodar, located about one hundred and thirty miles south of Rostov, which is an oil refining area. Although there is a road connecting the two cities, it is crossed by as many as twelve rivers, giving Soviet forces a defensive advantage. The battle situation near Zymlyanskaya, one hundred and ten miles northeast of Rostov, appears to have stabilized. However, German forces are continuously transferring fresh troops to the southern bank of the Don River in the hope of expanding their bridgehead. The fighting is currently very intense. From the Soviet perspective, the Don River, about two hundred and thirty miles long, can be forcibly crossed at any point, making it impossible for the Red Army to prevent. Therefore, the Red Army's main defense line will be east of the river, between the Don River, Krasnodar, and the Stalingrad railway. Moscow has acknowledged that the German vanguard is now only forty-five miles from the Volga River, and a major battle is about to take place between the Don and Volga Rivers.</p>
<p>Allied Press, Moscow, 27th - According to an official announcement by the Soviet Information Bureau on the 27th, Soviet forces have withdrawn from both Novocherkassk and Rostov.</p>
<p>Haitong Press, Berlin, 28th - According to German military headquarters, German forces on the lower Don River have occupied Bessergenevskaya, located about twenty kilometers east of Novocherkassk on the northern bank of the Don River. German forces have broken through the Don River's defensive fortifications at that location.</p>
<p>Haitong Press, Berlin, 28th - According to well-informed sources, German and allied forces have occupied Betskoye, south of Veshnevskaya on the southern bank of the Don River. This is an important Soviet stronghold. German forces have built multiple bridgeheads on the southern bank of the Don River. German forces are also continuing to advance in the Don River bend area. There have been no major developments in the battles north of Voronezh. Soviet attempts to break out have continued to suffer heavy losses. A fierce battle involving tanks and mechanized units has taken place in Karach, about six hundred kilometers east of Kursk. The coastline controlled by Soviet forces in the Black Sea, which was previously 1,950 kilometers, has been reduced to 650 kilometers between the Kerch Strait and Batumi.</p>
<p>Haitong Press, Berlin, 28th - The German High Command announced last night that a Soviet 1,200-ton transport ship, two oil tankers, five barges, and a tugboat were sunk by German aircraft in the Volga River area during the day and night. The barges contained troops and ammunition. Several other barges were damaged. Other German aircraft attacked a town in the Kuban region in multiple waves, causing eight major fires and numerous smaller fires.</p>

<p>Allied Press, Tokyo, 28th - The Japanese Information Bureau announced at 5 PM today that the Imperial Government, in response to the request of the National Government, has decided to provide a loan of 100 million yen to the Central Reserve Bank in order to promote the sound development of the Central Reserve Bank's currency issuance system. The loan agreement was formally signed today between the Bank of Japan and the Central Reserve Bank.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Statement by Finance Minister Zhou <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 28th - Finance Minister and President of the Central Reserve Bank, Zhou Fohai, issued a statement regarding the 100 million yen loan, saying, "Through the mediation of the Japanese government, the Central Reserve Bank has today concluded a 100 million yen loan agreement with the Bank of Japan. The establishment of this agreement is of great benefit to the sound development of the government's currency system and the establishment of the foundation of the Central Reserve Bank. The Central Reserve Bank has a short history since its establishment, but its progress has been extremely smooth. Recently, the success of currency unification has made Central Reserve Bank notes the basic currency of Central China."</p>
<h3 id="e4">Statement by Finance Minister Kaya <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 28th - After the establishment of the 100 million yen loan between the Bank of Japan and the Central Reserve Bank, Japanese Finance Minister Kaya issued the following statement: "The Bank of Japan's loan of 100 million yen to the Central Reserve Bank agreement was concluded today. In June of last year, our government reached an agreement with the National Government for a loan of 300 million yen. This time, in order to assist the sound development of the National Government's currency system, the Bank of Japan is lending 100 million yen to the Central Reserve Bank. In order to make Central Reserve Bank notes the basic currency and to unify the market value of Central Reserve Bank notes with military scrip, the National Government is both promoting the circulation of Central Reserve Bank notes and establishing their independent value. Since the implementation of these policies, the National Government's monetary system has gradually been unified, and the credit of Central Reserve Bank notes has become increasingly consolidated. This time, in order to further promote the sound development of the currency system, Zhou Fohai came to Japan to negotiate a loan of 100 million yen. Our government has always made its best efforts to assist in the strengthening of the National Government and the consolidation of the Central Reserve Bank, so we are happy to provide this loan. Therefore, the decision was made for the Bank of Japan to lend 100 million yen to the Central Reserve Bank. The Bank of Japan is the central issuing bank in Greater East Asia, and the Central Reserve Bank is also a very important part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, these two banks should maintain close ties and cooperate with each other. From this perspective, we can understand the extremely significant meaning of this loan's establishment. With the establishment of this loan, I firmly believe that the issuance reserves of Central Reserve Bank notes will be further strengthened, and that there will be a more tangible effect on the work of currency unification. We sincerely look forward to this."</p>
<h3 id="e5">Statement by Governor Yuki <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 28th - President Yuki of the Bank of Japan recently made a statement on the 100 million yen loan, stating, "The Central Reserve Bank is a powerful wing in the financial world of Greater East Asia, and I am confident that it will have solid development in the future. Therefore, the Bank of Japan will spare no effort to provide full assistance. Furthermore, the establishment of this loan, along with the previous loan from the Bank of Japan to the Thai Ministry of Finance, will further establish the foundations of currency and yen credit in various parts of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and new institutions. Therefore, the mission of the yen in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will become even more important. As for the outline of the agreement: The Bank of Japan will lend 100 million yen in Japanese currency to the Central Reserve Bank for a term of five years. The Central Reserve Bank shall pay interest on the loan at an annual rate of three and a half percent. The Central Reserve Bank may repay this loan at any time within the stipulated five-year period. The right term may be extended upon mutual agreement between the parties."</p>

<p>Allied Press, Tokyo, 27th - The Japanese Museum Association, in view of the diversity of East Asia's geography and history, recognizes the need to establish a comprehensive museum for research purposes. Therefore, since last year, it has been working on the construction plan for the Greater East Asia Museum.

It is expected that a concrete plan can be formulated within one or two months. According to the Japanese Museum Association, for the construction of the Greater East Asia Museum, the main building is planned to be located in Tokyo, and branch museums will be established in major cities both domestically and abroad, such as Osaka, Shonan (Singapore), and Batavia (Jakarta). The initial plan for the construction of the main building is temporarily set at 10 million yen, and it will be expanded by tens of millions of yen after the war. The work of the museum will include the collection of astronomical, humanistic, political, economic, photographic, and artistic materials from all over East Asia.

<h3 id="e9">Heavy Fighting Resumes: American Aircraft Bombing Tobruk and Crete <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Allied Press, Lisbon, 28th - According to news from Cairo, after the British army's offensive in the northern sector was repelled, fierce fighting broke out along the entire Alamein line yesterday, and the artillery battles became even more intense. This is a prelude to the resumption of land warfare on the Egyptian front after three days of silence. Both sides are rushing to prepare for a large-scale operation to occur at any time. Although the fighting is intense at the moment, it is limited to local engagements, rather than a full-scale battle on the entire front. The Cairo Gazette acknowledges that British forces have abandoned some of the land they recovered yesterday under heavy concentrated shelling from German artillery.</p>
<p>Allied Press, Lisbon, 28th - According to scrambled dispatches from Cairo, the Egyptian Alamein front has been silent for three days. On the night of Sunday last week, fighting resumed, but it was only of a local nature. The battlefield was in the northern Mediterranean coastal area. Details are not yet known.</p>
<p>Haitong Press, Rome, 28th - The Italian military headquarters announced this afternoon that the enemy's offensive south of El Alamein yesterday was unsuccessful, resulting in heavy losses. The German 90th Division and the Italian "Trento Division" captured 1,000 prisoners, destroyed 32 enemy tanks and 30 armored vehicles. At the southern end of the battle line, an enemy tank force attempted to press closer to our army's defense line, but was driven back by artillery fire. Reconnaissance units from both sides engaged in fierce fighting, forcing the British army to retreat.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, 28th - According to a report from London, the British army's offensive in the Alamein area has been stopped by Rommel's army's landmines and field artillery. As a result, the British army has gained nothing except in direct attacks. The landmines laid by the Axis forces from the coast to Qattara Depression have established a strong defensive position. Furthermore, according to news from Turkey, approximately 200 eighteen-ton tanks from the German army have recently been reinforced Rommel's army through a certain country, and have already traveled from a certain place via Crete and Tobruk. Most of the German troops waiting on Crete are also moving to North Africa. The current Egyptian front is relatively stable. The British army's deployment currently consists of British troops and Australian troops holding the area ten kilometers west of Alamein in Deir el-Eissa, and Indian troops securing the important positions near Qaret el Himeimat. The current tranquility on the front is the calm before the storm.</p>
<p>Havas, Somewhere on the Egyptian Border, 27th - In the past 24 hours, fighting on the Egyptian front has been silent due to severe sandstorms. Even minor clashes and scouting activities have almost completely stopped. Currently, the British army's positions extend from the high ground west of Alamein south to the Qattara Depression, a distance of about forty miles. Recently, the British army has strengthened its outposts. Rommel's army has also dug trenches and laid landmines. However, the British army believes that this does not mean that the German army is taking a defensive posture, but rather that they are preventing a British surprise attack. It is reported that a convoy of Axis forces, under heavy protection, is carrying ammunition to North Africa to resupply General Rommel. Allied air forces are currently preventing them from approaching the coast and are bombing transport bases such as Tobruk and Sidi Barrani. It is reported that the American air force has also recently joined the fighting. In particular, the bombing of Tobruk harbor on Sunday last week was carried out by American bombers. In addition, the American air force bombed the Heraklion airfield on Crete the day before yesterday. According to military experts, the narrowness of the North African front is extremely advantageous to the Axis powers. In this situation, even with a large British force, it is difficult to carry out a flanking maneuver. At the same time, General Rommel has placed tanks and artillery at strategic points and has made full use of the terrain to arrange his positions. However, both the British and German sides say that the current calm will be difficult to sustain.</p>
<p>Haitong Press, Rome, 28th - Frontline news states that a few days ago, a British armored vehicle force launched an attack on Italian positions in Alamein in North Africa. British Commander-in-Chief of North Africa General Auchinleck personally supervised the battle at the front. Due to the special terrain of that area, the Italian side only deployed infantry to defend it. Auchinleck believed that the tanks could break through the Italian infantry, but they did not succeed. The British tank offensive was repelled, and thirteen vehicles were destroyed by our forces.</p>
<p>Haitong Press, Milan, 28th - It is announced here that Colonel Fangigliarini, commander of the Italian 65th Infantry Regiment, was seriously wounded in action on the Egyptian front and has now died of his wounds.

Colonel Fangigliarini was one of the most capable officers in the Italian infantry.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 28th, Huitong News Agency Dispatch: Swedish Prime Minister Hansson stated in a speech delivered in several cities on Sunday that the development of the situation may force Sweden to fight for its most precious ideals. The current war is of great concern to Sweden, but there is no need for anxiety if all warring nations can respect Sweden's neutrality. The only unsettling event is the repeated violation of Swedish airspace by foreign pilots.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 27th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: Prime Minister Gan Sen stated in a speech here today that while both sides of the current great war are making every effort to respect our country's neutral status, this situation is subject to change at any time, at which point we will have no choice but to fight to defend our democracy and freedom.

<h3 id="e19">England and America to Change Strategy in the Atlantic; Important Meeting Held in Washington; Nelson Suggests Building Aircraft <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Washington, 27th, Vahas News Agency Dispatch: Military and political leaders from England and the United States are currently holding a very important meeting here, planning to completely change the strategy adopted by the Allies in the war zone, especially in the Atlantic. The most important problem currently encountered by the Allies is the issue of transportation. Personnel here generally do not recognize that transportation lines are actually in the most important position in the current war. Regarding this level, the Axis powers have a clear advantage. The transportation lines of Germany and Greece are not only very short, but also very safe. In the past eight months, that is, since the United States entered the war, German submarines have achieved initial success in the Atlantic, which is also an undeniable fact. According to a survey by the U.S. Wartime Shipping Bureau, the number of Allied merchant ships sunk in one week from the 5th to the 12th of this month was very large. Since the outbreak of the current war, the losses in this one week are the heaviest. Admiral Waferlich, of the Naval Battle Bureau of the German Naval Staff, recently said in a speech that "If the enemy can build more merchant ships, then we will build more submarines and continue to sink them, ensuring that the number sunk is greater than the number they can build. I can absolutely assert that we will be able to destroy the enemy's war machine," etc. It can be seen that Germany has decided to go all out in this regard. The U.S. government is expected to be aware of this. The only way to deal with the submarine crisis is to use aircraft as a means of transportation. Nelson, the head of the wartime production bureau, has already appointed a special committee to study the issue of using aircraft to transport commercial goods, and has submitted a report advocating doubling the production of commercial aircraft, expanding the fuselage, and increasing it to seventy tons. The U.S. General Headquarters will hold a meeting this week to discuss this report in order to decide whether to adopt this suggestion. If it is decided to adopt it, then nine naval shipyards will be converted into aircraft manufacturing plants. Based on this, the attention of American military personnel has shifted to aviation, believing that using aircraft as a tool for offensive strategy and believing that the best way to defeat Germany is to bomb Germany, "Dealing with it in the manner of a large-scale bombing of the port of Cologne." As a result of such bombing, Germany's industrial strength could be completely destroyed. Once this goal is achieved, invading the European continent and opening a second battlefield can be done easily.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 28th, Huitong News Agency Dispatch: U.S. Democratic Senators Lee and Johnson jointly submitted a proposal to Congress requesting the construction of a giant aircraft fleet to transport troops and war materials as a countermeasure to the submarine threat, since airborne transport is the only opportunity to win. Lee further stated that the German declaration to build enough submarines to obstruct American shipping routes was not an empty threat.</p>

Indian political parties or political leaders who want to open their doors will cause our Allied forces and air force to be threatened by the enemy. We will not sit idly by. According to Churchill's intention, this is to criticize Gandhi's uncooperative attitude and allow pro-British political parties to gain a major dominant force.</p>

The most serious period for cholera cases in the past 22 days was from July 19 to 25. During this period, as many as 220 cases occurred in the Chinese areas, the reason for which is actually due to the uncleanliness of drinking water and citizens' inattention to hygiene.

<p>Public Works Department Adds Offices</p>

<h3 id="e38">Notice from the Japanese Military Authorities in This City: Citizens Should Obey Air Defense Regulations <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>According to the Domei News Agency, the highest authorities of the Japanese Army stationed in this city, recognizing the importance of air defense in this city, have adopted thorough air defense measures. The highest commanders of the Army and Navy have issued a notice, and the Fourth Army Garrison Authority has issued a statement, hoping that the general public will strictly abide by the air defense regulations. The notice states: All citizens residing in Shanghai shall fully comply with the obligations stipulated by the relevant authorities regarding various civil air defense regulations. July 29, year 31. The supreme commanders of the Army and the supreme commanders of the Navy, and the Army and Navy Garrison Authority issued a statement saying that with regard to air defense measures in Shanghai, given the importance of this city, the relevant Japanese authorities have taken thorough measures. Furthermore, elite Japanese aviation units have preemptively attacked enemy air bases and defeated their air power. Therefore, until today, Shanghai has been free from the danger of air raids, and citizens have been able to live and work in peace. This is a cause for great rejoicing. However, as the Greater East Asia War develops into a world war, considering the mobility of aircraft, it cannot be said that Shanghai will absolutely not be the target of aerial guerrilla warfare. Therefore, regarding civil air defense, one should always "be prepared and not alarmed" and adopt foolproof countermeasures. Therefore, the highest commanders of the Army and Navy have issued a notice to the citizens of Shanghai, imposing on them the obligation to fully comply with various civil air defense regulations stipulated by the relevant authorities. The Shanghai Garrison and the Shanghai Naval Special Landing Force, the former being the Shanghai Army Air Defense Command and the latter being the Shanghai Navy Air Defense Command, guide the municipal government, the Public Works Department, and the Japanese Consulate Police in implementing air defense measures for the general public regarding civil air defense matters. It is hoped that henceforth, all citizens of Shanghai will strictly abide by the regulations and instructions of the authorities regarding air defense.</p>

Potted plants are arranged everywhere, designed by Zhou Shoujuan, the owner of Cardulu "Xiangxueyuan", a specialist in seasonal flowers. Music, it is said that in the future, in addition to selecting jazz music with good melodies, classical music will be offered to customers every week. That is another special point. There are also oil paintings by Fang Xueyu, a famous artist.</p>
<p>In addition to these, the reporter must also specifically mention a few points: the hotel implements scientific management. Every bell in each dining room has a direct line to the management office. If the waiter does not come in after the guest rings the bell for the third time, the red light of that number in the management office will light up. With this method of management, the waiter will not dare to be lazy. There is also a direct telephone to the kitchen, which can be used to urge dishes at any time.</p>
<p>Telephones, every large room has, there are fifteen machines in the whole store, and each room has a cloakroom, which is probably a new record for all Shanghai restaurants. Of course, with so many telephones, it is easier to implement scientific management in all parts.</p>
<p>In addition to Cantonese cuisine, the menu also includes Sichuan cuisine, Ningbo cuisine, and Suzhou cuisine. As for whether the dishes are cooked quickly, Mr. Li said that he restricts each common dish to be served to the customer within seven minutes of ordering.</p>

<p>In short, the new New Capital Hotel, mobilizing more than a dozen experts, after four months of preparation, and spending three million yuan of savings, the impression given to us is really extraordinary. If we say that Zhuangyuanlou, Hongyunlou, and the like belong to the first period in the development history of Jiuying Pavilion, and Weiya to Xinya Jinghua Hongmian belong to the second period, then the New Capital should belong to the first work of the third period.

<p>Yesterday's black market for government bonds unexpectedly returned to a tired path, which is what most experienced people can see, it is a temporary psychological effect, and has no relationship. The multi-party feels a little discouraged, the momentum is slightly weaker, and the seller takes advantage of it. In fact, like Shun Gongmao, it is still a consistent idea, and there is no eagerness. This is a temporary abnormal state, the result of endless floating. Some have their own industry needs, and replenishing vacancies is mostly the goal. Investors are not lonely, such as Hanji, Tonglirun, Lihua, Jiujing, Hengkang, Xinglian, and Yiyi, all are absorbing at low prices. People's hearts are stable, and the transformation must be very fast. Yesterday's market resulted in a uniform drop of 35 cents to one yuan, with a turnover of about 1.12 million yuan. A brief list is given below.</p>

Therefore, the minds of the same industry who hold the goods changed with the opportunity, and the shouting price rebounded and supported the market, and the market atmosphere saw a good again. And buyers are still buying in. Therefore, the market price per barrel of Beisi rebounded from 700 yuan to 750 yuan, and the holders are still optimistic.</p>

<p>In order to suppress the price of goods and reduce the burden of people's livelihood, the authorities will gradually implement price limits and quotas for various goods. It is learned that the Shanghai Special City Cigarette Industry Association yesterday received a notice from the authorities, ordering its members to sell according to the price set by the China Branch Cigarette Cooperative Group. The association immediately complied and published an announcement in various newspapers. Considering that 90% of the members in this city have not joined the Yongtaihe peer, it is difficult to maintain business by selling at this limited price. The association understands the difficulties of its members, so on the one hand, it persuaded members to comply with the law and not exceed the price limit, and on the other hand, it submitted a document to the authorities, requesting permission to universally join the peer so that members can obtain the right to distribute goods in order to continue business and maintain social order. A summary of the price limits of each cigarette is listed below: 10 large British 1 yuan and 8 jiao, 50 large British 8 yuan and 8 jiao and 5 fen, 10 old knives 1 yuan and 3 jiao and 5 fen, 10 Pin Hai 1 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen, 10 Fairy 1 yuan and 5 fen, 10 Wuhua 1 yuan and 5 fen, 10 Qianmen 2 yuan and 5 fen, 20 Qianmen 4 yuan and 2 jiao, 50 Qianmen 10 yuan and 3 jiao and 5 fen, 10 small three cannons 3 yuan, 20 small three cannons 5 yuan and 9 jiao and 5 fen, 10 sailors 2 yuan and 8 jiao, 50 officials 10 yuan and 5 jiao, 20 officials 4 yuan and 2 jiao (the above are calculated in central reserve certificates).</p>

<p>Summer medicines are still tired and unable to be compared. Sales on various roads are still few and far between, and the buying and selling of hoarders is cold as ice, so the price is not much different. Tiger brand headache powder is 21 yuan, Wan Jin Oil is 19 yuan, Bagua Dan is 17 yuan, Hegu vegetables are 55 yuan, and Longhu brand Rendan is 14 yuan. Only Baifu oil sells well, so the price is still firm, 16 yuan per dozen, and Wudi tooth powder is 10 yuan, all should be calculated in units.</p>

<h3 id="e61">"Lang Deshan's Technique" <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Lü</p>
<p>The technical entertainer Lang Deshan is meeting the people of Shanghai again this time with performances at the Great Light Theater. It truly feels like Shanghai residents are getting an ice cream treat in this "boiling over the whole city" hot summer. After all, Shanghai residents have heard of his name for a long time, and who wouldn't want to go and see what it's all about?</p>
<p>This time's performance is in collaboration with the New Myriad Flower Troupe, but the performances are still independent of each other. The so-called collaboration is merely that the Myriad Flower Troupe's orchestra plays along during Lang Deshan's performance.</p>
<p>After the Myriad Flower Troupe's song and dance concluded and a ten-minute break was taken, it was Lang Deshan's turn to come on stage. When the curtain was raised for the second time, the backdrop behind had been changed to an antique-style picture of the Hall of Supreme Harmony, embroidered in white on a large red background. Strong lights shone on it, making it even more beautiful and pleasing to the eye. Mr. Lang Deshan, wearing a traditional Chinese robe, walked cheerfully to the front of the stage, holding the Pan sisters by the hand. The first performance was the Chinese magic trick "Burning Belt Reversal." Although everyone is already accustomed to this type of magic, it still appeared exceptionally brilliant when performed by Mr. Lang. Moreover, the two beauties beside him holding the belt—the Pan sisters—added an extra touch of splendor to Mr. Lang's performance.</p>
<p>After the magic trick, Mr. Lang took off his robe, revealing a short Chinese-style jacket made of white satin embroidered with black silk. He personally directed the technical performance of the "Lang Family Band." The first performance was the "Guangdong Basin" technique. A little girl held two short sticks in her hands, each topped with a constantly spinning basin. While holding these items, she also acted: flipping from a stool to the ground, then crossing her hands and flipping from the ground back onto the stool. She even placed two cups of water on her forehead and flipped backward. She danced for ten minutes, and the basins on the sticks she held in her hands continued to spin without ever falling, earning enthusiastic applause from the audience. The little girl was no more than thirteen or fourteen years old, with a very cute face and two small braids. Her facial expression remained smiling throughout the performance. Following this were performances by a strongman, steel dancing, and so on, interspersed with performances by the Pan sisters.</p>
<p>The acting skills of Pan Yuzhen and Yulan that garnered the most thunderous applause from the audience were the "Diabolo" and "Umbrella Dance." In the diabolo performance, they initially performed separately: throwing up, catching, rolling over their backs, passing under their legs, and other amazing feats. Then, one person spun two diabolos, and two people exchanged diabolos. A foreigner sitting nearby watched with wide eyes, nodding continuously.</p>
<p>Lang Deshan is from northern China (his wife is French), but he has lived abroad for a long time. His Chinese has become somewhat "pidginized." During performances, he mostly uses English for explanations, followed by Mandarin, and occasionally Japanese. The various techniques he has trained are indeed admirable.</p>

<p>— Lan Ying</p>
<p>Since Lan Lan was also at Xia Xia's house, I certainly wasn't going to let her go. So, after talking with Xia Xia last time, I talked with Lan Lan for a while.</p>
<p>"Is Mr. Sun in Chongqing? You must miss him a lot!"</p>
<p>"It's alright! You could say I miss him a lot, or you could say I don't miss him much. It's much more meaningful for two people to be apart and do their own things than to be together and do nothing. Originally, 'happiness is in constant work,' isn't it? To be honest, two people who don't get along won't get along even if they're together every day; two people who are meant to be together will be together even if they're on opposite sides of the world. In reality, they'll always be together. Missing or not missing, it's all the same anyway."</p>
<p>"How's your 'Seven Women' coming along?"</p>
<p>"—I'm currently adapting 'Waterloo Bridge,' and it's almost finished."</p>
<p>"You're really capable—writing, acting, directing, you do it all!"</p>
<p>"When there's a shortage of scripts and talent, I feel that people who can write should try to write. The quality of the results doesn't need to be worried about."</p>
<p>She was wearing a suit, supposedly because she had a dance class that day. This made me think about the issue of costumes: "Do you think costumes have a significant relationship with a play?"</p>
<p>"I think the color and texture of costumes can often help actors express a character's personality, although some people think that with excellent acting skills, you don't need to pay attention to whether costumes are beautiful or ugly."</p>
<p>"Do you like managing household affairs?"</p>
<p>"If I can balance both inside and outside the home, that would be best; otherwise, I'd rather act. For me, the stage is more suitable than the family."</p>
<p>"Did you study English Literature at Yenching University?"</p>
<p>"No, it was Psychology. Originally, when I came to Shanghai, I didn't join a theater troupe or engage in dramatic work. It was completely accidental. However, now I feel that psychology is very beneficial for an actor."</p>
<p>She lives on Rue Sapey, but Xia Xia said, "If you want to find her, you can come to my place. She spends more time here than at her own home."</p>

<p>After Song Dezhu arrived in Shanghai, he was very busy with social engagements. Yesterday, he went out to visit people all day. In the evening, Xu Xiaochu, Chen Chengyin, Huang Xianzhong, and others from the Shanghai Opera School hosted a banquet for him at the New Xianlin Restaurant. Li Hewen, Wang Jinlu, Chu Jinpeng, Ci Shaoquan, Guan Dehan, and several Pingju performers also attended. There was much laughter and lively conversation at the banquet. Song Dezhu frequently urged the guests to drink, claiming that he could drink three pounds of yellow wine without getting drunk, showing his great capacity. It is now scheduled for the 31st to take to the stage, with a performance period of up to two months, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Miscellaneous Notes from San Ya Lu <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— Li Quan</p>
<p>Following the death of Yan Jupeng, the master of xiaosheng, Cheng Jixian, has also passed away. When Yang Jiaxun (Xiaolou) passed away earlier, it was rumored that Jixian had also passed away one after another. Many newspapers and magazines recorded this. Fortunately, the rumors turned out to be false, and the performer was actually unharmed. Last year, he even came with Xiaobo, and we were able to see Mr. Cheng's skills on the red carpet again. Although he was getting older, his example was there, every gesture and movement was perfect. Jixian was the grandson of the great master Cheng Changgeng. He studied at the Xiaorongchun Opera School as a child and had a friendship with Xiaolou. Later, he worked in Prince Gong's residence and received a fifth-rank official hat, rising to the position of Deputy Director of the Ministry of War. In the early years of the Republic, Yu Zhenting led the Bianqing Society and invited him to join, and he, Xu (Diexian) and Wang (Lengxian) were known as the "Three Immortals." When he came to Shanghai last year, I had the chance to listen to his plays like Gongyinghui and Zhuangyuanpu, and I didn't expect it to be a final farewell. His elder brother, named Shaotang, was an official to the rank of Secretary, receiving the patronage of Li Wenzhong Gong. In the early years of the Republic, he was a secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and was said to be fluent in four languages.</p>
<p>There are three people who have become lead roles from supporting roles, namely Gao Qingkui, Li Mingyu, and Guan Shengxi. Gao was the father of Sheng Linshou. After becoming famous, he absorbed and integrated various schools and tunes, leading to criticism of impurity. Li came from the Mingshenghe Opera School and took Liu Po (Hongsheng) as his model. Guan was a third-class student of Fu Liancheng. He and Da Yuanshengji were brothers. When Er Yunshi came to Shanghai in the past, he was still a supporting lao sheng. However, his performances were quite energetic. His Sixth Son in Yanmen Pass and Yang Zhaojun in Mu Guiying (singing the beheading scene) were praised by the old opera connoisseurs. Therefore, when he was in Mao Wu's troupe, he had the momentum to overwhelm Sha Shixin. Since returning to Beijing, he has worked harder and leaped to become a second-tier lao sheng. Li Shifang, Zhang Junqiu, and Zhang Eyun all liked to invite him to be their supporting actor. It is hoped that Shengxi can remain humble and diligent so that when he comes to Shanghai again in the future, the people of Shanghai will look at him with new eyes.</p>
<p>Previous reports mentioned the marriage of Ji Yuliang and Li Lihua, which has been debunked by this newspaper. However, this reminds us of her ancestor Li Guifang. Guifang's father was named Yaxian and studied qingyi. Guifang used the stage name "Er Yinzi" in his early years, specializing in xiao sheng. Later, he changed to xiao sheng and became one of Yang Rongsheng's famous disciples. His singing, acting, and appearance were all excellent. He lived in Shanghai for a long time, and Beijing opera performers who came south liked to have him as a supporting actor. His wife, Zhang Shaoquan, is also Li Lihua's mother.</p>
<p>Yang Xiaolou's art was greatly influenced by Yang Rongsheng, but the merit of his Thirty-Six Friends cannot be ignored. Xiaolou was a devout follower of Taoism, which led to his being unfamiliar with martial arts skills. Fortunately, his friends Ru Xijiu, He Peiting, and thirty-four others urged him to practice together every day, so he would not be lazy. There is a martial arts play called Cao Family Tower, also known as Five-Faced Yoke, also called Thirty-Six Friends. The two are in harmony, and it is also clever. Xijiu is the son of the famous qin master Ru Laiqing and the father of Fu Lan; Peiting is the son of martial net He Guishan, both of whom belong to the younger generation of performers.</p>
<h3 id="e65">A Tour of the Opera School (Part 1) <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi Yu</p>
<p>People cannot have a fulfilling life without art. Art is an essential element for invigorating and elevating people's spirits and thoughts, nurturing and influencing people's temperament and character, and advancing culture to seek human progress. All civilized countries in the world strive to promote art, and the dramas of Germany, France, and Russia are particularly outstanding. Our country has thousands of years of education and has a unique and worthy aspect of drama. Since Dr. Mei Lanfang's tour of Europe, Chinese "xieyi" (freehand) drama has become increasingly popular throughout the world.</p>
<p>The purpose of drama is originally to "change customs" and "correct music and education." However, most of the old-fashioned opera school performers who are tainted with the habits of the pear garden have not taken on this responsibility. The times are progressing, and now we should abandon all prejudices and misunderstandings, actively promote the mission of drama, and raise the value of Chinese drama so that it becomes a valuable art that transforms society, opens up the people's wisdom, and adapts to the times.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Opera School was created based on this principle. They picked up the shortcomings of the old-fashioned opera schools and adopted the strengths of the new-style schools. Although it has only been established for more than two years, the results have been remarkable. They have given 281 public performances, appeared on the screen once, and filmed a "Song of Ancient China."</p>
<p>In order to understand the situation of the opera school in the past two years, I went to the opera school on the morning of the 20th for a tour:</p>
<p>Stepping into the gate, I saw a thick carpet laid on the corridor. There were a dozen boys practicing somersaults, shirtless and sweating. Going up the stairs was a large auditorium. On the walls hung many plaques donated by social celebrities and pear garden performers. I was cordially received by Mr. Guan Hongbin, the director of the school's educational affairs, and we started our conversation in his office:</p>
<p>According to Mr. Guan, "The opera school did not expect to be where it is today when it was founded. After more than two years of hard work, we have finally lived up to our original intentions. At that time, about 400 or 500 people applied after we advertised for enrollment. After rigorous testing, we admitted more than 240 people. Now, most of these more than 240 students have been able to perform on stage. Only twenty or so students have not yet been able to perform, and we will give them a chance to practice on stage in the future."</p>

<p>Shanghai Art Theater will be closed for two months starting from August 5th. The Carlton Theater will be sublet to Huayi, and the play "Rujian Shi" written by Hu Tiwei will be staged. After two months, it will return to Shanghai Art Theater, and a great play will be performed for a week. Ticket prices will be raised to ten yuan, it is said.</p>
<p>The Kuguan Theater Troupe organized by Shi Hui, Yingzi, and others has now been merged into the drama group of CZC Entertainment Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>China Travel will enter the Queen's Theater on August 1st. The first play will be "Tears of the Setting Sun" written by Gu Zhongyi.</p>
<p>After "Madame Butterfly," Li Pingqian adapted Wu Yu's stage comedy "Four Sisters." Gong Qiuxia, Chen Qi, Zhang Fan, and Wang Danfeng will play the four sisters.</p>
<p>Wan Cang's new work "Two Generations of Women" will start filming soon. The actors include Yuan Meiyun, Huang He, Yan Hua, etc.</p>
<p>He Zhaozhang's new work "A Match Made in Heaven" will start filming in Factory Two after "White Angel" ends.</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Opera School has been performing at the renovated stage, the results have been excellent, and the public has given unanimous praise. Due to the hot weather, fearing that the students' physical strength will be insufficient, it has been decided to close for the summer from August 1st. When it is cool in the autumn, the famous performer Huang Guiqiu's "Spring and Autumn Match" will be performed.</p>

<p>The book "Autumn Begonia" is a masterpiece by the novelist Qin Shouou, and it was published in this newspaper and was very popular. Later, Mr. Qin rewrote the final section, and it has been published as a separate book. It is rumored that a certain leading member of the drama world plans to adapt this book into a script and stage it after the autumn.</p>

<p>Cheng Yanqiu's popularity on stage in Huangjin last year was unprecedented. His accurate pronunciation, clear enunciation, and varied tones were able to captivate the audience. "Suo Lin Nang" was especially impressive, and although it was performed for several days in a row, it was always full. Indeed, the addition of ban in the Xipi yuan ban and the addition of crying in the er liu were all original. Coupled with the support of the famous qin master Zhou Changhua, it felt like a perfect combination, adding a lot of color. As the saying goes, the peony is good, but it all depends on the support of the green leaves.</p>
<p>It has recently been heard that "Suo Lin Nang" has been recorded in the old capital. This once-popular play will now be popular throughout Shanghai, and those who cherish Mr. Cheng's artistic tune can enjoy it fully. (However, this is not for compensation)</p>

<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>Seven, Thunder</p>
<p>Wei Cheng said: "This meeting is like the Jin Sanye meeting, isn't it?" Mrs. Ye said: "Yes, yes, who did you hear that from?" Wei Cheng said: "When I was studying in my hometown, there was a local history class in school. The local history class mentioned the Jin Sanye meeting, which was a large-scale superstitious movement. Auntie, please continue to tell me." Mrs. Ye II said: "What I'm telling you is all what your mother told me. At that time, their boat was broken in the river channel. The people on the boat suggested going ashore. Anyway, the boat had to go ashore when it reached Daxing Town. Without going ashore, you couldn't see the meeting at all. It is said that when they went ashore, the sky was not very bright, but the shore was already full of dark heads. Your uncle was a leader of the group and rushed to the front, and the rest of the women followed him. When the sky was bright, they arrived in front of the Jin Sanye Temple. Your mother was the first to sound the retreat gong, saying that all there was was people挤来挤去, and if she had known this, she would have been better off sitting on the boat. But no one else was willing to retreat. From dawn to noon, more and more people came. The person in charge of the temple fair suddenly issued an order, saying that anyone who came to see the fair should retreat east to some bridge, west to Daxing Town, and south and north to some other place. In the area around the temple, only those who were participating in the fair were allowed to stand. The people who were watching the fair were not allowed to stay. At that time, the police in yellow uniforms and the people with red cloths tied on their arms were all beating people with rattan whips and sticks. Your uncle's character, you know a little about it. He is very willing to abide by the rules. Hearing that they were supposed to retreat, he squeezed into the crowd and retreated. Wei Cheng, you have to know that these people who came to see the fair came in batches. Although it was crowded, it was still easier to squeeze through. Now, with one retreat, it was like a mountain collapsing, like water gushing up. Some people fell to the ground, some people had their shoes trampled off, and some children and women were crying. Unfortunately, your mother got separated from her sisters and brothers from the same village, and even from your uncle, in this angry tide. Wei Cheng, at that time, it was not easy for women to go out, and going out to see the welcoming god temple fair seemed to be a not-so-legitimate thing, so after your mother was separated from the people who went with her, she was very regretful.
