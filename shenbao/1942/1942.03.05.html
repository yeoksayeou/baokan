<p>法軍備部虛有其名</p>
<p>顧就大禮而論、戰時工業國營法、極為有利、若干工廠改歸國營後、生產增加三倍、同時政府發給各工廠補償費五萬萬法郎、厥後即由接受補償費各廠投資於其他國防工業、從而增進法國生產能力、余無須以國營法就商於陸軍參謀部、良以該法原則、巳由國會通過、但事實上、余會以此事商諸軍事當局、軍事當局對此意見紛岐、工業國營法案、於一九三六年即向參衆兩院提出、原意一九三七年即可通過、但至一九三八年、尙未能通過、實屬可憾、當時政府亦認為此項法案係一種「社會化」之辦法、爰乃決定暫不付諸實施、參衆兩院討論此案、經年累月、未得結果、今日攻擊政府不設法使兩院早日通過者、會提出各項修正案、實堪詫異、按之實際、自一九三九年九月至一九四○年五月、全國工廠製造軍械之數量、亦大見增加、例如在總動員時、每日能製造平射砲一百二十尊、一九四○年二月、增加至二百四十五尊、五月又增至四百十四尊、此在高射砲及其他大砲之產量、亦復與日俱增、職是之故、法國未能充分準備作戰之責任、應由參謀部負之、至戰爭結束、尙有砲彈數百萬枚、炸彈數萬枚、儲藏各處、未能使用、不寗唯是、各種戰具、均由參謀部選定、惟其生產、則由陸軍部各部會監製、此在甘茂林將軍、對於實施此項軍械生產計劃、並得隨時過問、每至生產停滯時、渠即促余注意、惟余始終認為、尙有大批軍械未及使用、迨至動員之日起、甘茂林將軍已非余之下屬、尙屬於最高軍事委員會、在承平時期、設立軍備部、確保軍械之充分分配、在自由經濟制度下、絕對無益、是以此軍備部、徒有虛名而已、</p>
<p>甘茂林氏靜默無言</p>
<p>里翁三日哈瓦斯電賈奧斯庭長本日於審訊達拉第後、續訊前國防總司令甘茂林將軍、其經過情形、頗為「戲劇化」、庭長首謂君應發言、蓋陸軍方面端賴君為之辯護、否則將成衆矢之的矣、甘茂林答稱、余現居於囚犯地位、烏能置辯、庭長賈奧斯曰、余之所欲詢問者、為君究竟答辯與否、君於一九三五年一月二十一日、繼魏剛將軍出任參諜總長、其一部份職掌、乃在監督軍需生產、促進軍部各部份之工作、於此君亦有所欲言否、甘茂林答稱、余於前次進行初步調査時、業已有所答覆、庭長賈奧斯又問、前次調査、僅係預備性質、今君應好自辯護、甘茂林默無言、庭長又詢及作戰準備未充各節、甘茂林亦不置辯、審判長又曰、君實未能充分運用權力、君謂自陸軍部隸屬國防總部以後、軍需總監賈戈梅即代行君之職權、關於此點、當另向賈戈梅詢問、惟無論如何、君實未能運用權力、此外、賈並歷數軍需不充、工事不固之種種事實、甘茂林僅稱、余不能回答、庭上父問、君旣知需要重坦克車及巨型轟炸機、何以不向政府要求撥付鉅款、緣何不為君所應為、君對此項指摘、亦無言乎、庭長雖一再盤詢、至此、庭長謂甘茂林曰、余祇可紀錄君之靜默無言矣、乃於下午五時十五分宜吿退庭、定於七日開庭審訉關於前航空部長賴尙伯部份、</p>

<p>上海中華基督敎靑年會舉辦「農學講座」、前日下午四時開始第一講、聽講者座無虛席、主講人徐天錫敎授、講兩小時、莊諧並作、使聽者毫無倦容、茲分述概要如下、</p>
<p>業餘農業家　我國自古以農立國、然到如今、一般人對於新農業、往往很隔膜、很輕視、以致認識不足、但在都市裏、倒產生了許多「業餘農業家、」對農業頗感興趣、想辦農塲的人、着實不少、他們原本不是研究農業的、借此來消遣、養雞、養蜂、養兎、種果園、菜蔬、不一而足、然失敗的十居八九、記得十餘年前、北平一帶、養蜂的人風起雲湧、間有因此而發財的、可惜北平不是養蜂的地帶、因園林太少、蜂塲太多、蜂就無從採蜜、結果非但不能產蜜、反用白糖喂蜂、其失敗可知、後來又爭着養兎、但失敗的人還是很多、不旋踵又銷聲匿跡了、又山西有位傲牧師、看到美國的高粱出產很好、說動了華洋義賑會、把數十萬元的賑款、去買了種子、米經實地試騐、貿貿然分發農民播種、誰知種了不一發芽、即使芽發了而收成不佳、結果又失敗了、此種事實、即是不認議新農業的害處、要說眞有研究的人、誠如鳳毛麟角、</p>
<p>輕視新農業　還有絕大多數人輕視農業、以為這是農民做的事、低微而沒出息、不屑為、也不足為、有的以為中國改良農業、無顯著的成效、有的說農科學生、耕種技術不及農夫、殊不知農業的科目繁多、且又非常奧妙、其實道種論調、就是中國新農業的致命傷、新農業的範圍約可分為十四門、如農藝·園藝·畜牧·獸醫·昆蟲·植物病理·農業經濟·農塲管理·森林·鄉村敎育·農業推廣·農業工程·蠶桑·農業化學等、每門又分為若干系、</p>
<p>新農業成效　中國新農業提倡了數十年、的確已有很多顯著的成效、就以上十四門中說、最有成績的首推農藝、作物改良成功的、如江浙兩省的水稻、戰後移往西南、廣西一省、已有二百萬畝、稻作改良後、產量又增百分之二十、連四川·湖南三省總計、不下六百萬畝、華北的棉改良得也好、棉種改良後產量多而織維長、小麥小米成績也極好、在作物改良方面說、我國技術的成就、不在日本之下、國際上也有了良好的名譽、其次農業經濟、如貸款·合作社等、各省也辦得極為發達、其次病蟲害的成績亦著、像華北的棉、向來有「蚜蟲」、現巳有防止的辦法、此為一大貢獻、又南方水稻的害蟲、已有「船梳」的方法、把稻的害蟲可以一網打盡了、又如農業水利、如綏·陝·川，桂·各省的水渠河流、政府於十年來都有偉大的設施以全國而言、新農業的幹部人才、即是實際推動的人、實在太少、中國的版圖極大、全國一千六百多縣中、如每縣設一農業試騐塲、至少即需一千六百個農業幹部人才、其他不必說、</p>
<p>怎樣來促進　我們要促進新農業、第一須社會人士認識新農業的重要性、第二須培養大批各級農業人才、有的人以為有了機器、、或有了化學肥料、纔配談新農業、其實道是大大的錯誤、至於農業敎育、分高級·中級·初級三種·高級的須農科大學畢業後再升硏究院、國內如金陵·中山·兩大學、巳經設置、不必再到歐美日本各國去留學、中級的農科大學畢業就行了、初級的只須讀完三年制的農業職校、我以為高級的幹部人員、全國至少需五萬人、中級初級的至少需五十萬人、纔够促進全國的新農業、</p>
<p>怎樣辦農塲　都會裏的人、要想辦農塲、切忌單獨性的辦鷄塲·蜂塲·兎塲而必須辦混合性的農塲、如園藝而兼辦畜收或果樹·菜蔬·等等、否則工人的工作、不能分配平均、而工作效率，不能增高、且須注意農業經濟、如產銷等、必須觀察得十分詳確、供少求多則利、供多求少則不利、新農塲切忌貪得無厭、欲一舉而就則必敗、初時規模不必大、從小做起、脚踏實地、一切根據科學原理、則前途當有成功之望、都市附近的農塲、以生產速成為上策、農產須趕在農民之前、如春夏季出產的菜蔬、能利用暖氣、提早於冬季出產、自然可獲善價而沽、如九月菊花能用「改光」法使在八月開花、豈不大佳、如「無子西瓜」必得都市中人的歡迎、西瓜而無子、亦是奇聞、但已有中國留美學生發明成功、又如番茄變大、非常奇怪、此法英國農業家也硏究成功了、</p>

<p>— 被騙</p>
<p>今因小號被騙去老酒一壜、事關同業、務懇借貴報一角登載、今日上午、一個老年茶役模樣、來叫酒二壜、當時言明價目、送三馬路、某大樓某報關行、貨到付款、即派人同去、送至該處、即又來二人聲稱、一壜須送別處、一壜先送樓上、當時留下一壜、由後來二人代為看守、另一壜則由送酒人、同來叫酒者引導上樓、故不疑有他、惟因抬酒較慢、至半逮忽不見該來叫酒老者、心知有變、急回至樓下、另一壜酒、已不翼而飛、始知遇一騙、詢諸該大樓鄰人、則云該處有四路可通、此種受騙、時有發生、九江路恒豫興紹酒棧謹啟</p>

<h3 id="c47">投機的「集郵家」 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— 尋淵</p>
<p>報載：本埠郵政局，最近發覺郵箱內投遞之信件，每為人所竊去云。這眞可惡得很。別的東西不偷，念頭竟轉到區區信件上來，抽絲剝繭的剽剪，所値雖然集少成多，行徑到底在剪繒賊拋頂宮之下，實在太「小兒科」了；而在失主方面看來呢，損失倒未可以金錢計算，或者是火燒信，或者是吿急信，甚至是情書，家務信，報喪信，莫衷一是，人家望穿秋水，急不可待，竊信賊却順手牽來，剪而挖之，有傷陰騭，莫逾於此。古時誤托洪喬，投之於水，為的靑島使實在怕麻煩；現在人家出了足郵，小小心心，送入郵筒，却一去杳如黃鶴，空餘此筒，為的竊信賊有利可圖，然而煞風景惡作劇則初無二致，予人以惡劣「印象」！</p>
<p>近年來市面不佳，窮極無聊的人實在層見疊出，挖空心思的「小活兒」也源源而來，竊信不過一端而巳，似乎是小焉者也。倒棺材剝屍衣旣已數見不鮮，究風有點血淋淋；幾毛錢鉛絲，「委曲」一下，把有上「下次遞取時間」招牌的小門開了，不啻探囊取物。——然而這裏中國的有，外國的投機集郵家却老早已有過，這不是新鮮的把戲。外國的竊信賊據說竟然有着大規模的組織，專揀有匯票的信偷，比「集郵」更「偉大」和緊張，但由此當局也訓練出一班專揀「投機的集郵家」抓的人，這些稽査員在郵局各處，甚至郵箱左右往往而有，比比吿是，眼睛彷彿是鷹隼和貓兒眼的混合物一樣，燒他竊信賊機警非凡。</p>
<p>可是此時此地抓竊儅賊到底是便利的，郵筒郵箱大多數未曾「落荒而設」，祇要大衆注意，竊信賊匍下去終難逃彰彰之眼，偶而想把筒口挖得大些，要末信件尙留在鋼攔之上，不過一舉手之勞，否則祇好帶上一具氧氣溶鋼器。</p>
<p>然而這時勢，一根長些的鋼絲也要兩三角，何况此器乎！</p>

<p>— 王旋</p>
<p>莎士比亞名悲劇「羅密歐和茱麗葉」中的男主角羅密歐蒙泰格，在他的故里意大利的伐洛那，已是個被遺忘的人。莎士比亞雖說這一對不朽的情侶是一起殉情的，可是在伐洛那，却我不出這兩個歷史上最著名情侶最後殉情地的證據。茱麗葉的芳塚在浦河之濱，新婚的夫婦們常去憑弔，茱麗葉誕生的家，還有那羅密歐求愛的陽臺，至今尙在，一般情侶常到那裏去憑弔；外牆上還有一方金屬牌在着，表示這是茱麗葉的父母卡普萊特的「宮」，由此便可認明它是茱麗葉的家。羅密歐的家，就是附近一條小街上，雖然還屹立着，底層沒有鐵匠店，然而它和羅密歐本人一樣的被人們遺忘和拋棄了。</p>
<p>雖然傳說羅密歐是和他心愛的茱麗葉葬在一起的，但是茱麗葉芳塚的大石碑上所刻字句，表示它是和羅密歐無關的。上世紀裏，巳有許多人憑弔茶麗葉的石柩，常有人在柩蓋的四週鑿石一方，留做紀念品。到後來，柩蓋竟剝落到二吋深，當時便有人　建修道院一所，把茱麗葉的石柩移葬在修道院的小敎堂裏。</p>
<p>敎堂旁另有一所古老的佛蘭錫斯根修道院，造於一二三○年，有許多根據可證明。這兩惆不幸愛人秘密結婚時，為之祝福的著名修道士洛侖佐特萊傑奧（莎士比亞筆下的修道士勞侖斯），便是佛蘭錫斯根修道院裏的修道士。茱麗葉芳塚所在地的修道院四週，環繞着成蔭的栗木，柏樹，燦爛的鮮花，噴泉和石凳，院中央是一支織長的圓柱，上面是「埃馮河畔斯特拉福的詩人」的半身像，它是「眞誠忠實的茶麗葉」芳塚的守護者。</p>
<p>茱麗葉至今還接到愛慕者的信件，然而羅密歐已不在愛慕者的記憶中了。茱麗葉的芳塚前，有一隻小小的信箱，上書「給茱麗葉的信」，意大利的情侶們，有傳統的信心，以為前往憑弔而投信在箱中，那末在戀愛上，便有幸運；，據守墓的老者說，從來沒有寄隻字給羅密歐的。</p>
<p>意大利某雜誌曾經詳細調査，發現伐洛那的女郎取名茱麗葉的，有一百零三人，名喚羅密歐的男子，却只七人。</p>

<p>— 澤夫</p>
<p>彈棋之創始，舊有二說：一謂始於漢武帝時。武帝平西域，得胡人善蹴鞠者，蓋銜其便捷跳躍，帝好而為之，羣臣不能諫。侍臣東方朔因以此藝進之，帝就捨蹴鞠而上彈棋焉（見晋徐廣「彈棋經序」）。一謂始於漢成帝時。成帝好蹴鞠，劉向以為蹴鞠勞人體，竭人力，非至尊所宜，乃因其體而作彈棋以解之（見晋傳玄「彈棋賦序」）。然其戲至後漢冲質以後，遂吿中絕。魏文帝特好此戲，復見盛行，至宋則已失傳，故今無戲之者。戲法，古時用白黑棋各六枚，二人對局，先列棋相當，更先彈之。其局以石為之，中心隆起，四角微翹，頗似龜甲之狀。至唐則改用二十四拱，半貴半賤，用朱墨以別焉。其局亦不限於石製，或木或玉。此種彈棋，旣由蹴鞠轉變而來，故棋必圓形，始可彈擊。而棋局中心隆起，故以此棋而彈彼棋，甚非易事。按今西人打彈子之戲，亦以彈子互相彈擊，多中者多勝，似即我國彈棋之遺製；，惟彈棋只用手彈，而彈子則用棒擊，又彈檯平坦，是其不同耳。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japanese Advances Continue in Java; Fierce Fighting Northeast of Bandung; Heavy Fighting West of Surabaya; Allied Planes and Submarines Very Active <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Domei News Agency Telegram) – Asahi Shimbun Shanghai reports that Japanese mechanized units reached a location west of Surabaya early this morning. Allied forces there are strongly resisting the Japanese attack, resulting in fierce fighting. Meanwhile, Yomiuri Shimbun's Shanghai dispatch states that the Dutch military headquarters in Bandung announced last night that Japanese forces are vigorously attacking the northeast of Bandung, leading to intense fighting with Dutch forces.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Domei News Agency Telegram) – News from the Java front indicates that a large number of Japanese aircraft raided Bandung yesterday, causing heavy damage for about half an hour and destroying oil depots. Furthermore, the vanguard of one Japanese force has reached a point 30 miles from Bandung.</p>
<p>Bandung, 4th (Reuters Telegram) – Although the Allied forces in Java are putting up a very strong resistance, they have been forced to retreat. According to a public statement issued today by the Dutch East Indies military headquarters, the only report concerning the Java war is that our forces are currently engaging the Japanese army with an offensive spirit. Wherever the Japanese army advances, our forces are responding to prevent the loss of territory. Due to the Japanese army's numerical superiority in the air, some progress has been made. Japanese aircraft launched a fierce raid on an airfield near Bandung, damaging military targets. Several of our aircraft on the ground caught fire.</p>
<p>Saigon, 4th (Haitong Telegram) – An official communiqué released in Bandung today acknowledges that Japanese forces in Java have made progress. It stated that the Japanese forces landing in Java, despite strong resistance, have made some slight advances.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Haitong Telegram) – Frontline dispatches report that Japanese forces in Java are continuing to advance. Japanese forces in western Java have occupied a certain important airfield north of Bandung. Other Japanese forces have occupied a certain railway hub near the north coast, believed to be Tjikampek.</p>
<p>Bandung, 4th (Reuters Telegram) – Dutch and Allied aircraft are actively engaged in combat over Java. Dutch submarines are also operating in the Java Sea. No further Japanese landings are occurring on the island of Java due to a lack of detailed reports.</p>
<p>British Forces Under Sitwell's Command</p>
<p>Bandung, 4th (Reuters Telegram) – After General Wavell resumed his position as Commander-in-Chief in the Indian theater, a large number of staff officers and auxiliary officers under his command remained in the Java British military operation zone under the command of Major General Sitwell.</p>
<p>London, 3rd (Havas Telegram) – After General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied forces in the Southwest Pacific, went to India, it was officially announced here that the British military authorities had appointed Major General Sitwell as commander of the British forces in Java. Major General Sitwell is a military expert known for his strategic skills.</p>
<p>Saigon, 4th (Haitong Telegram) – News from the capital of the Dutch East Indies last night indicated that General Wavell's departure from Java and the dissolution of the Allied Command in the Southwest Pacific had caused alarm and disappointment in Batavia. The people of Java believe that the British are fleeing the island because they believe Java cannot be defended. Java now believes that Britain and the United States have abandoned the island, despite previous declarations by Britain and the United States, "We will do everything in our power to help."</p>

<p>Melbourne, 3rd (Havas Telegram) – The authorities announced this afternoon that Japanese aircraft attacked Port Moresby today, but only briefly, with minimal damage.</p>
<p>Canberra, 4th (Reuters Telegram) – The Australian Minister for Aviation announced today that the airfield and port facilities at Port Moresby on the south coast of New Britain were attacked by Japanese aircraft yesterday afternoon. Broome, on the coast of Australia, was attacked yesterday. Seven people were killed or injured.</p>
<p>Saigon, 4th (Haitong Telegram) – Sydney newspapers unanimously advocated yesterday that the defense of Australia should be entrusted to an American general. General MacArthur is considered the most suitable for this position. As Australia's crisis intensifies daily, there is an urgent need to seek foreign assistance. Britain is unable to take care of itself and can only seek help from the United States.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Haitong Telegram) – "Kokumin Shimbun" issued a serious warning to Australia yesterday, saying that if Australia does not change its hostile attitude towards Japan, the recent Japanese air raid on Darwin will only be the prelude to an invasion of Australia.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Darwin Continues to be Raided <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Canberra, 4th (Reuters Telegram) – Australian Prime Minister Curtin announced today that Darwin was continuing to be raided by Japanese planes. Detailed reports have not yet been received.</p>
<p>Saigon, 4th (Haitong Telegram) – A dispatch from Sydney states that the Japanese air raids on Darwin are ongoing. No details have been specified.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 3rd (Havas Telegram) – Military circles here anticipate that war will soon break out in Northern Europe, as Britain is likely to launch an offensive there to fulfill the Soviet request to open a second front. It is expected that Germany will launch a spring offensive, primarily targeting the Soviet Caucasus region, as Germany seeks to quickly seize oil wells there, while threatening Soviet supply routes through the Middle East. This is why the Allies are exerting all their efforts to keep the Murmansk and Archangel ports open. However, if the Allies do launch an offensive in Northern Europe, it is not impossible that Sweden will be drawn into the maelstrom.</p>

<h3 id="e12">Riom Court Opens Fifth Session; Daladier's Lengthy Testimony; Responsibility for France's Inadequate War Preparation Should Fall on General Staff <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Lyon, 3rd (Havas Telegram) – The High Court in Lyon, hearing the case of treason, opened its fifth session today. One of the main defendants, former Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense Daladier, gave a lengthy testimony on France's inadequate war preparation and backward production technology. However, another defendant, former Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Army General Gamelin, remained silent and refused to answer when the presiding judge, Caous, asked him to explain his own responsibility for France's inadequate preparation. At the time, Daladier was questioned first. Judge Caous asked whether it was true that various particularly important industries in the Paris area remained unchanged despite the danger of air raids. Daladier said that specialized technical personnel could only be recruited in Paris. Major factories, such as Renault and Rosengart, had indeed been moved inland. As for the nationalization of certain wartime industries, it never contained any political motives. Political opponents used this as an excuse to attack me, which is hardly convincing. In fact, the nationalization laws were almost unanimously passed by the National Assembly. In fact, I only ordered ten factories to be nationalized. However, some industrialists interfered when they learned that their factories would be nationalized. At the same time, another group of industrialists only sought to fulfill arms orders from foreign countries, even from countries in Central and South America, which is deplorable. Take the state-owned Blen Steel Plant as an example. We proposed changing the company to a semi-official and semi-private nature, but the company authorities demanded compensation in every detail. On December 31, 1936, the day before the company was nationalized, the factory transported all files and plans out of the office in trucks, and I had to order the police to stop them. As for the Creusot Steel Plant, designated by the French government, after the government decided to nationalize the company, the factory carried out actual sabotage, cutting off internal traffic in the factory. Experts in the factory were also attracted to other jobs by high salaries.</p>
<p>French Ministry of Armaments Exists in Name Only</p>
<p>Considering etiquette, the wartime industrial nationalization law was extremely beneficial. Production tripled after certain factories were nationalized. At the same time, the government paid the factories 500 million francs in compensation, and then the factories that received compensation invested in other defense industries, thereby increasing France's production capacity. I do not need to consult the Army General Staff on the Nationalization Law, because the principle of the law has been passed by the National Assembly. But in fact, I consulted the military authorities on this matter. The military authorities had diverging opinions on this. The Industrial Nationalization Bill was submitted to both houses of Parliament in 1936, with the intention of passing it in 1937, but it was not passed until 1938, which is regrettable. At that time, the government also considered this bill to be a kind of "socialization" method, so it decided not to implement it temporarily. Both houses of Parliament discussed this case for many years without results. Today, attacking the government for not finding a way to make the two houses pass it earlier and submitting various amendments is surprising. In practice, from September 1939 to May 1940, the number of weapons manufactured in factories across the country also increased significantly. For example, at the time of general mobilization, 120 direct-fire guns could be manufactured every day. In February 1940, it increased to 245 guns, and in May it increased to 414 guns. The output of anti-aircraft guns and other cannons also increased day by day. For this reason, the responsibility for France's failure to fully prepare for war should be borne by the General Staff. By the end of the war, there were still millions of shells and tens of thousands of bombs stored in various places that could not be used. What is more, all kinds of weapons were selected by the General Staff, but their production was supervised by various departments of the Ministry of the Army. This meant that General Gamelin could always inquire about the implementation of this weapons production plan. Whenever production stagnated, he would urge me to pay attention. But I always believed that there were still a large number of weapons that had not been used. From the date of mobilization, General Gamelin was no longer my subordinate, but belonged to the Supreme Military Council. In peacetime, the establishment of the Ministry of Armaments to ensure the sufficient distribution of armaments is absolutely useless under the free economic system. Therefore, this Ministry of Armaments exists only in name.</p>
<p>General Gamelin Remains Silent</p>
<p>Lyon, 3rd (Havas Telegram) - After questioning Daladier, Presiding Judge Caous continued to question former Commander-in-Chief of National Defense General Gamelin. The process was quite "dramatic." The presiding judge first said, "You should speak, because the army depends on you to defend it, otherwise you will become the target of public criticism." Gamelin replied, "I am now in the position of a prisoner and cannot defend myself." Presiding Judge Caous said, "What I want to ask is whether you will defend yourself or not. You succeeded General Weygand as Chief of the General Staff on January 21, 1935. Part of your responsibility was to supervise military production and promote the work of various departments of the military. Do you have anything to say about this?" Gamelin replied, "I have already answered in the previous preliminary investigation." Judge Caous asked again, "The previous investigation was only preliminary. Now you should defend yourself well." Gamelin remained silent. The presiding judge also inquired about the various sections of inadequate war preparations. Gamelin also did not defend himself. The presiding judge then said, "You really failed to make full use of your power. You said that after the Army Ministry was under the National Defense Headquarters, Director-General of Military Supplies Jagomei acted on your behalf. On this point, Jagomei should be questioned separately, but in any case, you really failed to exercise your power." In addition, Jia also listed various facts of insufficient military supplies and unsound projects. Gamelin only said, "I cannot answer." A question was asked in court, "You already knew that heavy tanks and giant bombers were needed. Why didn't you ask the government to allocate huge amounts of money? Why didn't you do what you should have done? Do you have nothing to say about this accusation?" Although the presiding judge repeatedly questioned, at this point, the presiding judge said to Gamelin, "I can only record your silence." The court was adjourned at 5:15 pm, and it was decided to hold a hearing on the part of former Minister of Aviation Raishangbo on the 7th.</p>
<p>German Criticism of the Lyon Trial</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Haitong Telegram) - When the German Foreign Ministry received reporters yesterday, Intelligence Director Dr. Schmidt revealed the talks between German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and French Foreign Minister Bonnet in 1938, as well as the documents issued by Ribbentrop to the French ambassador in 1938 and 1933. Schmidt pointed out that the trial in Lyon was only about minor issues, i.e., why France lost the war. In fact, the Lyon court should investigate why the person in charge of France committed the crime of declaring war on Germany. During the Czech incident, the German Foreign Minister expressed to the French ambassador Ponset that if France interfered in Germany's affairs, the result would be France losing its status as a strong country. However, Ponset and his successor, Ambassador Colondre, did not mention the danger of war with Germany in their reports to Paris, but only reported according to the wishes of the ruling authorities in Paris. This was part of the reason for leading France to participate in the war. When German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop visited French Foreign Minister Bonnet in Paris in December 1938, Bonnet indicated that France would not interfere in Eastern European affairs, and would pay attention to the development of its colonies. Thus, Franco-German understanding was established, and Germany also began to change its plans for Eastern Europe. But when Ribbentrop went to Warsaw, Bonnet suddenly declared that France could not ignore the development of Eastern European affairs. At this time, the German Foreign Minister deeply understood that the alliance between France and Poland was a great threat to the German-French understanding. And why Polish Foreign Minister Beck changed his attitude every day. Afterwards, the German Foreign Minister published his letter to the French Foreign Minister, in which he accused France of breaking its promise in the agreement with Germany. Minister Schmidt finally said that the Lyon court should question Daladier why he obeyed Britain and declared war on Germany. If this question is not answered, then the trial in Lyon is unnecessary. If the trial continues as before, the French and the French government will be ridiculed by the world.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Cigarette Price Limits to be Implemented, Cigarette Prices in Punan Remained High Yesterday <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>According to news from cigarette shops yesterday, after the White Area Administration issued an order to limit cigarette prices in Hongkou and Wayside districts, cigarette prices in Punan had not yet been affected yesterday. According to cigarette merchants, the Japanese announcement only applies to Japanese shops, so they said that they would not lower cigarette prices until the Shanghai Municipal Council forced them to do so. A spokesman for the Shanghai Municipal Council said that the cigarette price issue is still on the council's price control agenda. The council has already limited the price of some types of cigarettes. As for whether to control the prices of other types of cigarettes, it is still difficult to say. The Municipal Council must first conduct a detailed study of its inventory, supply, and manufacturing issues before controlling any kind of price. As far as cigarette prices are concerned, the council is currently waiting for a letter from the Japanese authorities. Yesterday morning, cigarette prices in Punan were as high as ever. A small number of shops could sell 20-stick packs of Camel and Lucky Strike for $6.50 each, Roy for $4.50, and Conqueror for $1.80. The prices of other brands of cigarettes also did not fall.</p>
<p>The French Concession is studying solutions. The "Shanghai Times" reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council has been engaging in extensive research in preparation for announcing control over cigarette prices. At the same time, it is heard that the French Concession authorities are also studying the measures to be taken to control cigarette prices and reduce them to normal levels. It was recently rumored that the Japanese authorities intended to dump a large number of cigarettes made from American and Virginia tobacco on the market. The Japanese Consulate-General then announced cigarette price limits a few days ago and ordered all Japanese shops to comply. Since the outbreak of the East Asian War, the prices of various cigarettes have risen. However, yesterday (the 3rd), the selling prices of cigarettes in most shops were lower than the market prices before the Japanese Consulate announced the price limits, because most shops feared that the authorities would prohibit the excessive increase in cigarette prices, so they were willing to sell at the price limit set by the Japanese Consulate.</p>

<p>It has recently been reported that the agreement on joint bicycle licenses has been signed. Yesterday, a reliable source told reporters that an announcement on the joint bicycle license matter is expected to be issued within the next few days. It is heard that this matter has obtained an agreement in principle. The reason why the announcement has been delayed is only because some minor problems have not been resolved. The Shanghai Municipal Council, the French Municipal Council, and the Chinese authorities are currently working to resolve these minor difficulties, and then plan to implement the joint bicycle license system in various regions. This joint license will be obtained by each car owner from the governing authority of the area in which they reside. The license fee is still unknown.</p>

<h3 id="e29">How to Understand the New Agricultural Youth Association First Agricultural Lecture <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA held the "Agricultural Lecture." The first lecture started at 4 PM the day before yesterday. The audience was full. Professor Xu Tianxi, the speaker, spoke for two hours, combining humor and seriousness, so that the listeners did not feel tired. The summary is described below.</p>
<p>Amateur Agriculturists: Since ancient times, China has been founded on agriculture. However, to this day, the general public is often very ignorant and contemptuous of new agriculture, resulting in insufficient understanding. However, in the cities, many "amateur agriculturists" have emerged, who are quite interested in agriculture. There are indeed many people who want to set up farms. They were not originally engaged in agricultural research, but use it for recreation, raising chickens, bees, rabbits, and planting orchards and vegetables. However, eight or nine out of ten fail. I remember more than ten years ago, the trend of beekeeping in the vicinity of Beiping was in full swing. Occasionally, some people made a fortune from it. Unfortunately, Beiping is not a suitable place for beekeeping, because there are too few gardens and too many bee farms, so the bees have nowhere to collect honey. As a result, not only can they not produce honey, but they have to feed the bees with white sugar. Their failure is conceivable. Later, they competed to raise rabbits, but many people still failed, and soon disappeared. Also, there was Pastor Ao in Shanxi, who saw that American sorghum was produced very well. He persuaded the China International Famine Relief Commission to use hundreds of thousands of yuan in relief funds to buy seeds. Without field testing, he rashly distributed them to farmers for planting. Who knew that the seeds would not germinate, and even if they did, the harvest was poor, resulting in another failure. This kind of fact is the harm of not recognizing new agriculture. To say that there are people who really study it is as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns.</p>
<p>Contempt for New Agriculture: There are also a large number of people who despise agriculture, thinking that this is something that farmers do, low and without prospects, not worth doing, and not enough to do. Some people think that China's agricultural improvement has no significant effect. Some say that agricultural students do not have as good cultivation techniques as farmers. Little do they know that agriculture has many subjects and is very mysterious. In fact, this kind of argument is the fatal injury of China's new agriculture. The scope of new agriculture can be divided into about fourteen categories, such as agronomy, horticulture, animal husbandry, veterinary medicine, entomology, plant pathology, agricultural economics, farm management, forestry, rural education, agricultural extension, agricultural engineering, sericulture, and agricultural chemistry. Each category is further divided into several departments.</p>
<p>Effectiveness of New Agriculture: China's new agriculture has been promoted for several decades, and there have indeed been many significant results. Of the above fourteen categories, agronomy is the most successful. The successful crop improvement, such as rice in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, was moved to the southwest after the war. In Guangxi province alone, there are 2 million mu. After the rice improvement, the yield increased by 20%. Including Sichuan and Hunan provinces, the total is no less than 6 million mu. The cotton in North China has also been improved well. After the cotton variety is improved, the yield is high and the fiber is long. The achievements of wheat and millet are also very good. In terms of crop improvement, China's technological achievements are not inferior to Japan's, and it has a good reputation internationally. The second is agricultural economics, such as loans and cooperatives, which are also very developed in various provinces. The third is the achievement of diseases and insect pests. For example, the cotton in North China has always had "aphids," and now there are ways to prevent them, which is a major contribution. Also, the pests of rice in the south have a "boat comb" method, which can catch all the pests of rice. Another example is agricultural water conservancy, such as the canals and rivers in Sui, Shan, Chuan, and Gui provinces. The government has made great facilities in the past ten years. In terms of the whole country, the cadres of new agriculture, that is, the people who actually promote it, are too few. China's territory is very large. Among the 1,600 counties in the country, if each county has an agricultural experiment station, at least 1,600 agricultural cadres are needed. Needless to say others.</p>
<p>How to Promote: To promote new agriculture, first, the social community must recognize the importance of new agriculture, and second, a large number of agricultural talents at all levels must be cultivated. Some people think that new agriculture can only be discussed with machines or chemical fertilizers. In fact, this is a big mistake. As for agricultural education, it is divided into three levels: senior, intermediate, and junior. Senior students must graduate from agricultural colleges and then go to graduate school. Domestic universities such as Jinling and Zhongshan have already established them. There is no need to study in Europe, America, and Japan. Intermediate students can graduate from agricultural colleges. Junior students only need to complete a three-year agricultural vocational school. I think that at least 50,000 senior cadres are needed nationwide, and at least 500,000 intermediate and junior cadres are needed to promote the new agriculture nationwide.</p>
<p>How to Run a Farm: People in the cities who want to run a farm must avoid running a single chicken farm, bee farm, or rabbit farm, but must run a mixed farm, such as horticulture combined with animal husbandry or fruit trees, vegetables, etc. Otherwise, the work of the workers cannot be distributed evenly, and the work efficiency cannot be increased. Attention must also be paid to agricultural economics, such as production and sales. They must be observed very carefully. If the supply is less than the demand, it will be profitable. If the supply is more than the demand, it will not be profitable. New farms must avoid being greedy and trying to achieve success in one fell swoop. It will fail. The scale does not have to be large at the beginning. Start small, be down-to-earth, and base everything on scientific principles, then the future will have hope of success. Farms near cities should prioritize producing quick results. Agricultural products must be ahead of the farmers. For example, vegetables produced in spring and summer can be produced in winter using heating, and naturally can be sold at a good price. If chrysanthemums in September can be made to bloom in August using the "light change" method, wouldn't that be great? "Seedless watermelon" will definitely be welcomed by urban people. Watermelon without seeds is also a wonder, but it has been successfully invented by a Chinese student studying in the United States. Another example is that tomatoes become larger, which is very strange. This method has also been successfully researched by British agriculturists.</p>

<p>Cheng Jintao, manager of the Da Customs Brokerage at No. 38 Bund, French Concession, was entrusted by a client last year to entrust Chen Ruisheng (28 years old, from Anhui), manager of the Nantong Customs Brokerage, to transport a box of Western medicine worth more than 10,000 yuan to Beisha Juegang. Unexpectedly, after Chen took the truck, there was no news of him. Cheng searched everywhere without success, and then reported to the French Police Station requesting investigation and arrest. Yesterday, Cheng learned that Chen would come to Shanghai from Nantong by boat, so he went to the pier with a detective to wait. When Chen arrived, he was arrested and is now being held in the police station for investigation.</p>

<p>Today, because a small shop was cheated out of a jar of old wine, which concerns the industry, I would like to use a corner of your newspaper to publish it. This morning, an old tea servant came to order two jars of wine. At that time, the price was clearly stated, and they were to be delivered to a certain customs brokerage in a certain building on Sanma Road, with payment upon delivery. Then a person was sent with the wine. Upon delivery to the location, two more people came and claimed that one jar had to be delivered elsewhere, and one jar had to be sent upstairs first. At that time, one jar was left behind, and the two people who came later were entrusted to watch over it. The other jar was guided upstairs by the wine deliverer and the person who came to order the wine, so there was no suspicion. However, because carrying the wine was slow, the old man who came to order the wine suddenly disappeared halfway. Knowing that something had happened, he rushed back downstairs, and the other jar of wine had disappeared. Only then did he realize that he had been cheated. Asking the neighbors in the building, they said that there were four roads leading through here, and this kind of fraud occurs from time to time. Respectfully announced by Heng Yuxing Shaoxing Wine Shop, Jiujiang Road.</p>
<p>How to Evict Tenants</p>
<p>I saw your newspaper publish detailed reports on the Shanghai Municipal Council's crackdown on subletting, which should be followed. However, according to Shanghai customs, once a house is rented out, when the owner wants to take it back for personal use, regardless of whether it is a full lease, a partial lease, or a sublease, if there is a fixed-term lease, legal action can be taken, but it is still difficult to enforce the eviction. If there is no fixed-term lease, it is absolutely impossible to recover it. Even if you ask the court to order eviction, no case has ever been approved. The authorities have strict regulations on subletting, but there are no regulations on recovery for personal use. It seems that a clause should be added to the crackdown, explaining how to evict tenants if the house is actually needed for personal use. Ping Qi.</p>
<p>Inquiry about Returning to Guangdong</p>
<p>I want to return to Guangdong as soon as possible, but I am not very clear about the route. I would like to ask for your guidance on the following questions: What are the procedures and locations for registering to return to Guangdong? If there are no direct routes between Shanghai and Guangdong, is there another way to return? He Yongsheng, No. 133 Avenue Haig.</p>
<p>Answer to the Method of Treating Ear Discharge: I read in your newspaper's Social Services column about the matter of ear discharge. I have a simple method to treat it. Just buy a bottle of "double ammonia water" from a pharmacy, use a toothpick with cotton wrapped around the head, soak it in the medicinal water, and wash the ear several times a day. It will soon be completely cured. Please try this method. Respectfully announced by Dong Cheng, March 1st.</p>
<p>Answer to "Nightmare Caused by Cat Spirit"</p>
<p>This disease is called "angina pectoris," also known as "coronary artery disease." It is a temporary spasm of the blood vessels on the heart, causing blood flow to be obstructed, resulting in this phenomenon. Nitite and injections of Euphylin and Glucose can be used to reduce this pain. Chinese medicine can try taking Xiaosheng Guipi Pills, three coins with warm water before going to bed every night.

<p>The cash dark market has gradually shown fatigue, and people from all sides turned from tight to tired the day before yesterday afternoon. Due to certain relationships, many retail bulls sold out in groups on the previous two days, and certain gold shops rushed to release large amounts early in the morning. The market price was pushed down amidst a wave of selling. The opening price was 13,900 yuan, the same as the closing price of the previous day. Gold shop assistants and securities houses such as Jiayu sold off, and the silver shop assistants also supplied more than they demanded, and the price stepped down by 300 yuan to 13,600 yuan. Cash shops and a certain silver shop advanced to 13,750 yuan, but the market was weak, and the scattered selling wind revived, cutting down another 180 yuan, falling to a low price of 13,470 yuan. After 11:40, floating air filled the gap, and the gold shop assistants paid less, rising by 80 yuan. The closing price at noon was 13,550 yuan, 350 yuan less than the previous day. The difference on the day was 430 yuan, and the transaction was still rare. The exchange price of jewelry in silver shops was still 1,450 yuan by Dasing and their counterparts (the purchase price was reduced by 150 yuan, silver was listed at 14 yuan, the black market was 12.5 yuan. It was heard that there were sellers, and the price of one silver coin was 7.35 yuan.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange market situation has not changed much. The British gold pound is still 350 yuan, the US gold pound is still 360 yuan, the US dollar bill has slightly risen to 16.8 yuan, the Hong Kong dollar has continued to decline to 2.9 yuan, the big bill is 10 cents less, and the military ticket is 4.45 yuan.</p>

<p>The over-the-counter market for public bonds continues to rise. Types A, B, and E are comparatively stronger. Types C and D are being released due to continued selling of "Tongkang" and "Da Kang," and "Zhong Yi" is also being disposed of. "Da Zhong," "Shun Tai," "Xie Xing Yuan," and "Tong Ji" are all covering their short positions. Type C initially opened at 67 yuan, then slowly rose by 40 cents. However, temporary local rumors caused the market price to drop suddenly, but this quickly passed. Types A and B, however, remained strong. Although people are still somewhat uneasy, they know which are cheap, and many buyers are choosing carefully, indicating that the market can still gradually recover. The market price results, except for a slight drop of 5 cents and 40 cents for Types C and D, the rest rose by 20 to 60 cents. Transactions totaled approximately 4 to 5 million yuan. A brief summary is listed below:</p>

<p>The factory cloth market continued to be strong yesterday, because factory stocks are very tight, and dealers are searching for available goods, with demand exceeding supply. Sales prices for all cloths rose uniformly, and the market closed at the highest price of the day. 16-pound Flower Butterfly coarse cloth was at 135 yuan, Double Elephant at 132 yuan, Earth at 120 yuan, Big Peng fine cloth at 110 yuan, Fu Gui fine cloth at 107 yuan, Earth fine cloth at 110 yuan, Chang Shou plain silk at 4 yuan 55 cents, 190 American Ting shirting at 113 yuan, an increase of 1 to 2.5 yuan compared to the previous day for white cloth, and an increase of 1 to 3 yuan for bleached and dyed cloth.</p>

<p>The Nanjing merchants took away over 300,000 yuan, and sales in the market are brisk. The "kick the ball" business is reviving.

<h3 id="e45">Early Rice Prices Drop <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the supply of domestic early and late rice exceeded demand, and market prices immediately dropped by 5 to 6 yuan. Northern japonica rice is scarce and no samples have been seen. Those with available goods intend to raise prices, but are affected by the falling price of southern japonica rice, making it difficult to trade. Late rice, including Shi Pu, Si Qing, and other varieties, opened at 280 yuan, 278 yuan, and 277 yuan 50 cents, respectively. Early rice was at 279 yuan to 278 yuan 50 cents. However, Yuan rice is in short supply and selling well, with Yin Yuan rice out of stock. Jin Tan white Yuan rice opened at a new high price of 287 yuan to 290 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Bean Cakes Drop by About One Yuan <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The bean market is not selling well, and hoarders are afraid that the authorities will implement price controls, so they dare not raise prices further. Therefore, there are not many transactions, and the market is showing slight fatigue, down by one or two yuan. It is estimated that 100 bags of Kai Ping Hu Du beans were sold, priced at 169 yuan. 200 bags of Changzhou Niu Pi Huang were at 152 yuan to 151 yuan. 40 bags of Chong Ming Sha Huang were at 152 yuan, and 50 bags of Sha Chi were at 130 yuan. Over 100 bags of Qingdao second-grade green beans were at 130 yuan.</p>
<p>Red sorghum and raw peanuts are both scarce in arrival and stock. Sales in the local area are still brisk, and the situation is trending upwards. It is estimated that three carts of Kai Ming Guang red sorghum were sold, priced at 86 yuan to 86 yuan 50 cents, and high-quality goods were at 89 yuan. 103 bags of Shan Dong raw peanuts were at 280 yuan. 150 bags of Ming Guang raw peanuts were at 245 yuan.</p>
<p>The hoarding and sales of bean cakes remain slow, and people lack excitement. The market situation is still tired, and prices continue to fall by about one yuan. It is estimated that 1,000 pieces of Kai Hankou bean cake were sold, priced at 25 yuan. The Xing Ji bean cake for May, warehouse receipts for 1,500 pieces, were priced at 35 yuan 30 cents to 35 yuan 60 cents. The Li Zi bean cake, warehouse receipts for 5,000 pieces for March (lower) and April (upper), were priced at 40 yuan 5 cents.</p>
<p>Since bran has been handled by inland agents, the available goods on the market have gradually decreased, and Japanese factories are also releasing large quantities. Yesterday, some rural purchasers acquired goods, and holders are becoming more eager to manipulate prices. Orchid customer bran in small bags opened at 67 yuan 60 cents, while San Xin large bags were at 68 yuan 50 cents to 69 yuan. Small bags are currently out of stock, while March is at 70 yuan.

<h3 id="e47">Speculative "Stamp Collectors" <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— Xun Yuan</p>
<p>According to reports, the local post office has recently discovered that letters deposited in mailboxes are being stolen. This is truly despicable. Not stealing other things, but turning their minds to mere letters, painstakingly picking and clipping, although the value accumulates from small amounts to large, the behavior is ultimately beneath that of a common thief, truly too "small-time"; and from the perspective of the victims, the loss cannot be calculated in terms of money, perhaps it is a letter that got burned, or a distress letter, or even a love letter, a family letter, a letter reporting a death, the possibilities are endless. People wait anxiously, eager and impatient, but the letter thief casually grabs it, clips and digs it out, nothing is more detrimental than this. In ancient times, mistaking Hong Qiao and throwing letters into the water was because the Qingdao envoy was truly afraid of trouble; now people have paid the postage, carefully placing the letter into the mailbox, but it disappears without a trace, leaving only the mailbox, because the letter thief can profit from it. However, the unpleasant scene and bad joke are no different, giving people a terrible "impression"!</p>
<p>In recent years, the market has been poor, and desperate people have emerged endlessly. "Small jobs" that are designed with great ingenuity are also constantly appearing. Stealing letters is just one example, and seems to be a minor one. Digging up coffins and stripping corpses has become all too common, which is a bit bloody; a few cents' worth of lead wire, "bending" a little, opening the small door with the sign that says "Next Collection Time," is like taking something out of a pocket. However, the Chinese do this, but foreign speculative stamp collectors have long done it, this is not a new trick. Foreign letter thieves are said to even have large-scale organizations, specializing in stealing letters with drafts, which is more "grand" and tense than "stamp collecting," but as a result, the authorities have also trained a group of people specializing in catching "speculative stamp collectors." These inspectors are often found everywhere in the post office, even around mailboxes, watching closely, their eyes seeming to be a mixture of hawk and cat eyes, making the letter thieves extremely vigilant.</p>
<p>However, catching letter thieves is ultimately convenient here and now. Most mailboxes have not been "set up in the wilderness." As long as the public pays attention, letter thieves will eventually be caught. Occasionally, if they want to dig the opening of the mailbox a little larger, either the letters will remain stuck on the steel bars, requiring only a slight effort to retrieve them, or they will have to bring an oxygen-acetylene welding torch.</p>
<p>However, in these times, even a slightly longer steel wire costs two or three cents, let alone such a device!</p>

<p>Guoqi joined their joking conversation and said, "Guofang really knows how to handle a boat. Rowing, paddling, poling—these are the eighteen martial arts of boatmen, and she knows them all." Guofang pushed Guoqi and said, "Brother, don't give me so much credit. I just learned from others, and I didn't learn very well. What I'm most afraid of is wearing a blue cloth coat and walking on Shuangqiao Town. The people of Shuangqiao seem to have never seen a female student. No matter if they are men or women, they have to raise their eyes to look at me. If I go rowing a boat, even more people will be watching. It's not that I'm afraid of falling into the river, but I'm afraid that my every move will not escape the sight of so many people." Weicheng clapped her hands and laughed, "It's true that people in the countryside are amazed by the rare, but on the other hand, it also shows that you siblings are outstanding in Shuangqiao, so your every move is noticed." Guoqi was picking up candy and cookies from the blanket to eat. Even with his mouth full, he could still speak. He said, "Weicheng, when you praise Guofang, don't drag me in. Don't say 'you siblings' this and that. No one notices me in Shuangqiao. I'll give you an example: One day, I was wandering around on the street and hadn't returned home by lunchtime. My grandmother sent an old servant who had worked in the family for many years to look for me, asking people in the shops if they had seen Guoqi. The people in the shops answered that they hadn't seen him, but in fact, I was on the street, going back and forth, back and forth, several times. (13)</p>
<h3 id="e50">The Remains of the "Casting of Love" Protagonist <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Xuan</p>
<p>Romeo Montague, the male protagonist in Shakespeare's famous tragedy "Romeo and Juliet," is a forgotten man in his hometown of Verona, Italy. Although Shakespeare said that this immortal couple committed suicide together, in Verona, I cannot find evidence of the last suicide site of these two most famous lovers in history. Juliet's tomb is on the banks of the Po River, and newly married couples often go to pay their respects. Juliet's birthplace, as well as the balcony where Romeo courted her, still exist today, and couples often go there to pay their respects. There is also a metal plaque on the outer wall, indicating that this is the "palace" of Juliet's parents, the Capulets, which confirms that it is Juliet's home. Romeo's house is located on a nearby small street. Although it still stands, with a blacksmith shop on the ground floor, it, like Romeo himself, has been forgotten and abandoned by people.</p>
<p>Although legend says that Romeo was buried with his beloved Juliet, the words engraved on the large stone tablet on Juliet's tomb indicate that it has nothing to do with Romeo. In the last century, many people paid their respects to Juliet's stone coffin, often carving a square stone around the coffin lid as a souvenir. Later, the coffin lid was stripped to a depth of two inches, so someone then built a monastery and moved Juliet's stone coffin to a small chapel in the monastery.</p>
<p>Next to the church is an old Franciscan monastery, built in 1230, for which there is much evidence to prove. The famous monk Lorenzo Trejo (Shakespeare's Friar Laurence), who blessed these two unfortunate lovers when they secretly married, was a monk in the Franciscan monastery. The monastery where Juliet's tomb is located is surrounded by shady chestnut trees, cypress trees, brilliant flowers, fountains, and stone benches. In the center of the courtyard is a tall pillar, topped with a bust of "the poet of Stratford-upon-Avon," who is the guardian of the tomb of "sincerely faithful Juliet."</p>
<p>Juliet still receives letters from admirers, but Romeo is no longer in the memory of admirers. In front of Juliet's tomb, there is a small mailbox with the words "Letters to Juliet" written on it. Italian lovers have the traditional belief that going to pay their respects and putting a letter in the box will bring good luck in love. According to the old man guarding the tomb, no one has ever sent a single word to Romeo.</p>
<p>An Italian magazine once conducted a detailed survey and found that there were 103 girls in Verona named Juliet, but only seven men named Romeo.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Flicking Chess <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Ze Fu</p>
<p>There are two old theories about the origin of Flicking Chess: One is that it originated during the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. When Emperor Wu pacified the Western Regions, he obtained a Hu person who was good at Cuju (ancient Chinese football). Impressed by its agility and leaping, the emperor liked it and played it, but his ministers could not dissuade him. The attendant Dongfang Shuo then presented this art to him, and the emperor abandoned Cuju and took up Flicking Chess (see Xu Guang's "Preface to the Classic of Flicking Chess" in the Jin Dynasty). Another is that it originated during the reign of Emperor Cheng of the Han Dynasty. Emperor Cheng liked Cuju, but Liu Xiang thought that Cuju was harmful to people's bodies and exhausted their strength, so it was not suitable for the most noble. Therefore, he created Flicking Chess based on its form to relieve him (see Chuan Xuan's "Ode to Flicking Chess" in the Jin Dynasty). However, this game ceased to exist after Emperor Chong and Emperor Zhi of the Later Han Dynasty. Emperor Wen of the Wei Dynasty particularly liked this game, and it flourished again. By the Song Dynasty, it had been lost, so no one plays it today. In ancient times, the gameplay used six white and six black chess pieces, and two people played against each other, first placing the chess pieces opposite each other, and then flicking them first. The board was made of stone, with the center raised and the four corners slightly upturned, resembling a turtle shell. In the Tang Dynasty, it was changed to use twenty-four arches, half expensive and half cheap, distinguished by vermilion and ink. The board was also not limited to stone, but could be made of wood or jade. This kind of Flicking Chess was transformed from Cuju, so the chess pieces must be round to be flicked. And the center of the board is raised, so it is very difficult to flick one chess piece to hit another. According to the Western game of billiards today, the billiards are also flicked against each other, with the one who hits the most winning, which seems to be a legacy of our country's Flicking Chess; however, Flicking Chess only uses the hand to flick, while billiards uses a stick to hit, and the table is flat, which is the difference.</p>

<p>Since the Great Shanghai has been blockaded until now, some people say that Liu Qiong and Chen Yanyan are forbidden from having wedding guests making a scene in the bridal chamber. After repeated consultations with the authorities of the Great Shanghai Hu Guang, it has been decided that the premiere will be held at Hu Guang starting on Saturday, called "Replacing the Seat," because "Happy Years," which was originally scheduled to be released at Hu Guang, will also be "happy" at the Great Shanghai first.</p>
