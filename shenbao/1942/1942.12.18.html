<h3>廢除耶穌聖誕的習俗</h3>
<p>耶穌聖誕節不到一星期就要到臨了。依照往年的慣例，一般信徒和時髦的朋友都要乘機在歡一夜；而一般商店，娛樂塲所，也都別出心裁，爭奇鬥艷，以吸引顧客，企圖做一筆生意。本來，在承平的時候，這些也不値得重視。可是今年的情形不同了！今年的上海是在大東亞戰爭的範圍裏面，大家面前的不冉是醉生夢死或是歌舞昇平的日子，而是需要每一個市民擔負起戰爭的一部份責任的時候了——任何人都不能逃避戰爭的影響了。因此，我們在這一年度的聖誕節，便得準備新的慶祝方法！更有意義的慶祝方法！</p>
<p>耶穌的敎義只有兩個字，就是「博愛」！我們慶祝耶穌聖誕，首先就要紀念耶穌的博愛精神。我們應該反躬自問，每一個信徒，自己的身上，有沒有耶穌所傳給我們的「寶血」——爲拯救被難同胞而犧牲自己的血！沒有這種血而慶祝聖誕，以及把目光故意避開了四周圍受苦受難飢寒交迫的同胞而慶祝聖誕，都是違反了耶穌博愛的精神，這是妄圖穿過針孔的駱駝！</p>
<p>爲了這個意義，我們以虔敬的心，向上海成千成萬的基督敎徒獻議，在聖誕節前夕，廢除一切無謂的糜費，節省起那些向大商店，向大茶樓，向大酒店，向歌舞塲所消耗的金錢，集中起來，來拯濟上海成千成萬無衣無食，無家可歸的苦難的同胞，使他們得到溫飽，得到棲息之所，得到學習技藝以求自食其力的機會！在這苦難的環境中，這是每一個基督敎徒最應該做而且可以做的工作！在耶穌爲博愛而犧牲的精神之下，每一個基督敎徒起來反對聖誕節的無謂的　費吧，起來推動節的救濟貧民的運動吧！</p>
<p>同時，我們要正告一般非基督敎徒，切不可再利用耶穌聖誕而作在歡的打算，况且這一種慣例，原是英美人的習俗，父何必去學樣。應該節的一切茶樓酒店歌舞塲所的消耗，來做些有助於社會人羣的事業吧！來拯救那些貧苦無告的同胞吧！要知道只有社會上消失了那些陷人於貧苦無告的因素——一切自私自利不管別人死活的心理行動，社會才能眞正的繁榮，那時才値得大家在歡慶祝啊！</p>
<p>讓大家心裏的博愛，在大家自己的行動中表現出來吧！聖誕節是我們每個人這種　愛情　的　　　　的機會！</p>

<h3>決戰繼續着　（一）　平出海軍報道部課長廣播講詞　譯自十二月八日「讀賣報知」</h3>
<p>大本營海軍報道部課長平出英夫大佐於七日午後八時，在AK電臺，以「決戰繼續着」爲題，向全國廣播。廣播講詞中，最値得注意的有下面五點：（一）由於對敵海上兵力核心的擊破，以及諸要點的攻略，我方確立了優越攻勢。（二）單靠所羅門海域的對敵襲擊，尚不足以言全盤勝利。（三）說明美海軍的現有勢力，並警戒一部分人「美艦隊全滅」的錯覺。我新戰艦及航空母艦在相繼就役中。（五）設明繼續勝利並非就是最後勝利，並以促國民之覺悟。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭開戰以來，於茲匣歲；我日章旗，軍艦旗，在太平洋及印度洋各處迎風招展，令人欣羨，令人起敬。在一年前的今日，誰能想像，這是可能的呢？靠了隆隆的皇威，我們才一帆風順地留下如許多的戰績，這一點首先是要認識淸楚的。敵人雖已戰敗，但他們仍保持豐富的物資力和强大的生產力，他們仍在企圖執拗的反攻。然而無論他們怎樣來應戰，我們都得一悶棍打下去，打得他們不再出聲。際此國民不願忘，亦不能忘的第二個十二月八日，我們回顧過去一年間海軍方面的戰局，並展望將來推移的前途，希望大家再來一次擊滅敵人的決意。</p>
<p>一年間戰局之大觀</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭是由美國挑釁而起的。當時敵人阜已着着整頓了戰備，在十二月八日就發働了對日作戰計劃。藉飛機和艦艇在日本近海的强行偵察，潛水艇的魚雷攻擊，更有夏威夷西方海域對他潛艇的攻擊，等等，不一而足。終於使我帝國踏上了生死存亡最後的關頭。拜讀了宣戰大詔之後，我皇軍將士奮然而起；海軍方面，在初戰劈頭的夏戚夷·馬來海峽之戰中，擊破敵海上以及航空兵力的核心，給予了敵戰力以深刻的打擊。在渡洋作戰上說，確保制空制海權，是獲勝的第一要訣，而我們是以奇襲的姿態早已將這完成了。我陸海軍的協同作戰在各地展開，烏愛基，瓜姆，馬來，菲列賓，史馬特拉波乃奧，爪哇等地的敵根據點，及各要點，均被遂次擊破，戰前敵人自誇爲堅强不拔的對日包圍之鐵鎖，亦終被寸斷。初戰以來，我方遂確立了優越攻勢的礎石。</p>
<p>我海軍除確保必要的立脚點之外，也不忘了採取新的進攻姿態。舉例來說，四月上旬的印度洋作戰，八月上旬的東太平洋作戰，都是。在印度洋方面，我們自安達曼羣島，向柯隆坡，特林柯馬利突進；而在東太平洋方面，則急　了阿留申列島及密特威。</p>
<p>嗣是而後，我制空制海權日甚一日地擴大强化，敵的敗戰姿態也日甚一日地深刻起來。這樣，無論在戰略，或經濟上，帝國都走上了康莊的大道。</p>

<h3>桂省災情嚴重　農作物損失甚鉅</h3>
<p>本年上半年桂省受水災者·有陽朔·平樂·恭城·賀縣·昭平·蒼梧·等三十二縣。受旱災者，有靈川·永福·岑溪·平南·柳江·　容·等三十二縣。受蟲害者，有灌陽·沼平·蒙山·荔浦·恭城·等十四縣。受風雹災者，有昭平·宜山·武鳴·樂業·等六縣。因此農作物損失頗多，經估計，水稻减收的八七四•八六七擔，陸稻八三三·七三擔，玉米六四四·二九四擔，共他的一一四•五八五擔，災民達三十餘萬，不能不謂爲嚴重</p>
<p>截至九月間，　有桂省救災凖備金保管委員會提出二十五萬元，作爲灌陽·邕甯·博白·玉林·等受水災較重之十三個縣份急振之用，至於陽朔。東蘭等受水災較輕之另六個縣份，則由各該縣提用縣救災準備金，從事救濟。未會受到救濟的地方尚多，例如懷集一縣，在八月間已有飢民六萬三千零三十八人，內中能食米及雜糧的僅一萬八千人，食雜糧和草根者共的二萬人，其餘均以芭蕉根·土茯苓·等物充飢。又如蒼梧一縣，災民達十萬餘，省救濟準備金委員會僅撥五千元，當然無濟於事。</p>

<h3>松田中尉談　歸國印象</h3>

<p>肉類配給之範圍、雖未可與戰前相比擬、然日本人民天然喜食魚菓與蔬菜、故渠此行、未聞有一人發怨言者、蓋魚菓與蔬菜、現仍照舊配給也、一般日人之膳食中、棄除非需要品後、現已見人民臉龐上、顯露眞正健康與歡愉之徵象、渠以上海一般人民與目下日本人民之</p>

<h3>廿四曁卅一兩晚　延長娛樂時間</h3>
<p>工部局頃發布告第六二〇九號略稱、公共租界內各娛樂塲所、准於本年十二月廿四日及卅一日營業至次日晨二時收塲、但須遵守當局所定各項防空辦法</p>
<h3>糧食問題論壇</h3>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>筆者近日赴鄉，該地離滬不過數十里，素以產米著名，今年又逢大熟，禾稻堆積如山，農民喜形於色，米價大的是二百二十元，糙米且不滿二百，以視滬地之每石千元者，相距何營四五倍，即封鎖綫內外而言，則價格之相差，亦在一倍以上；一般人民的携帶只准二升，過此限制，即被沒收，但一般貧民，利用年糕糰子等食品，可與白米同時帶着，年糕的數量也加以限制，大概是每人五斤！在封鎖綫外面可以看見一列長蛇似的陣綫，各人手裏拿着年糕一紮，等候着規定時候的開放，爲他們計算一下，每天携帶一次，可以省下數十元！此種畸形的狀態，次不是一個正常的社會中應有的現象，在可能範圍內，總應替人民想法。</p>
<p>第二，即使因格於政令或由於政府其他方面的不便，不能把限制禁運的命令撤銷，則我人希望當局能顧全民食，允許上海米糧機關向內地產區採辦，因爲照事實言，內地的產量一向足够內地的消耗而有餘，往年之所以不見十分多餘者，或有砌積及收藏私買等原因在，但本年各地治安恢復，各物都有限價，將不至如以往的混亂狀態。上海當局能認眞向各地購買當地的餘糧，運來配給上海居民，眞正實行產銷的統制，則其效力一定不在第一點之下。至於所需經費，可向銀錢界設法，予以相當的利益，也是一個優良的投資目標。</p>
<p>不過最根本而且必須首先做到的一點，還是增加戶口米的配給量，這差不多是一致的要求，倘上面的一點能够實現而於戶口米的數量方面加以適當的調整，則化信糧食的恐慌很快可的得解决。（友羊）</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>我在鄉間有十數畝田，有些租給人種，有些合人混種。（人家出力我出肥料）照今年的年歲說，是大熟年，每畝扯收穫二石半以上，可憐我一粒米都不能帶到上海來自己享用。鄉間現在限價是二百廿元，如果糴了自己生產之米，再來糴上海的米，（戶口米實在不够吃，而說我家大小月十個人，最小的已經十四歲了。）可說我每畝的收穫僅僅六斗，完全漕糧，還不敷我的種本；所以人家或許是豐年，我却是兇年飢歲，眞合乎孟子所謂「糞其田而不足，又稱貸而益之」了。（葉人）</p>

<h3>禁止吐痰</h3>
<p>— 夷吾</p>
<p>近來，市政當局正厲行禁止吐痰運動。在幾條重要馬路上，如果有人吐痰，被巡捕發覺了，須處罰中儲券五元</p>
<p>痰，是人體內氣管和支氣管黏膜的分泌物。感冒的時候，痰最多。痰裏常含有結核菌，吐在地上乾了，結核菌就混在灰塵裏飛揚到空中。別人吸了，就很容易傳染着結核病。所以隨地吐痰，實在妨害公共衛生。</p>
<p>世界上各國人民，雖說種族上有黃白紅黑椶等區別；不過人體的構造，是沒有什麼截然不同之處。但是，我們毫無自卑的心理，總覺得我國人的痰，比外國人要來得多。如果不信，請看馬路上，店舖門前，電車候車站，小菜塲以及一切公共塲所，那地上可說處處是靑色綠色黃色的痰。最討厭的是在馬路上行走的時候，突然像流彈似的，一口濃痰從電車上或店舖櫃臺內飛射出來，不偏不歪，恰巧吐中行人的臉上。</p>
<p>和痰同質而異名的，是鼻涕。我國人痰多，鼻涕當然也小少。在馬路上，可以常常看見有人在哼鼻涕。其姿態，有些像擲鐵餅，有些像丟手溜彈。別人身七無事遭殃，那是不消說的了。</p>
<p>或許吐慣痰，哼慣鼻涕的人說；不吐不哼，難道嚥下去不成？其實，話不是這麼說的。身邊帶一方手帕，或帶些紙，不就解決了嗎？</p>
<p>我國人的不良習慣，何僅是隨地吐痰　雪白的牆壁上，寫着很大的黑字：「禁止小便」；行人却視若無睹，偏偏到那兒撒溺。</p>
<p>從前，我國大政治家子產說：「夫火烈，民望而畏之，故鮮死焉。水懦弱，民狎而玩之，則多死焉。故寬難。」現在，對於隨地吐痰的人，處罰中儲券　元。我想如果能認眞實行，至少吐痰的人，可以减去不少。這的確是件有益於市政的事，希望能積極進行。</p>
<h3>居禮的求書　（上）</h3>
<p>— Lincoln　Schuster著　古心譯</p>
<p>—世界著名科學家的書翰之一</p>
<p>前因　一八九三年，比耶爾·居禮（Pierre　Curie）雖然在法國並不爲人所知，却因爲他對於磁性和物理學的其他各部份，都有基本的研究，在歐洲其他各地，都已很著名。他完成了一種極度敏感的量電法，稱爲「居禮量電計」。克爾文（Kelvin）爵士親自公開承認他爲　學界的權威。爲了他這種富有創造性的偉大科學工作，又爲了他敎練着三十個學生，法國政府就在他三十五歲的時候，給他一筆每月三百法郞的薪水—一個完美的工廠工作人員的工資。他的銜頭是「巴黎城物理化學學校實騐室主任」。</p>
<p>他的朋友很少，據那些朋友說，「比耶爾·居禮在將他的身與心供獻給科學的硏究，「…「他不愛什麽人。」在他的日記中，有一次他寫着說：「天才的婦女是少的。」</p>
<p>後來比耶爾·居禮遇到了馬利·斯克洛杜夫斯卡（Marie　Sklodovska）。…她是從華沙來的，在沙爾蓬（Sorbonne）學校讀書，前一年，已經通過物理學的考試，那時正在準備算學的考試。他們在一個彼此都相識的朋友家裏見了面，那時他們的談話，可以用他們的女兒伊芙·居禮（Eve　Curie）的說話來形容：「不久就改成了科學的對話。…馬利，帶些懦怯與謙敬，發着問題，聽着比耶爾的意見。他解釋着他的計劃，形容着結晶學的現象，他對於結晶學簡直入了迷，那時正在從事硏究。這位物理學家想，對一個婦女，用了專門的名稱，複雜的公式，講着他所愛的工作，並且看見她，嬌媚而年靑，生氣勃勃，懂得他的話，甚至會用消楚無誤的見解，和他討論到某幾種情形，那是何等希奇呀？…那是何等美妙呀！「</p>
<p>這樣開始的友誼，比耶爾。居禮「用了溫柔的頑固」予以促進着。在實騐室中，她穿着「很大的麻布襯衣，沉默地俯身於儀器之上」，他看見她　樣之後，就送了她一本他最近出版的書：「物理現象的調和：電界與磁界　調和。」</p>
<p>馬利來巴黎之前，曾當過女敎師。現在她住在一個屋預閣樓上。據她的女兒爲她所寫的傳記說，「馬利爲了她第一戀愛的失望與屈辱，她立誓不再愛　麽人。她婚姻在她畢生的計劃中除開，爲她自己建起了一個英勇無比的秘密宇宙，用對於科學的熱情來控制着。」</p>
<p>比耶爾第一次向馬利求婚時，她拒絕了，不過她回到波蘭避暑的時候，他繼續用通信向她求婚。以下便是他那時寫給她的諸信之一：</p>
<p>「…我們所能作成的任何發現，不管牠怎樣渺小，總可以作爲　得的知識。」</p>
<p>本文　沒有什麼事情，比了得到你的消息，更爲愉快。一想到聽不見你的消息，還有兩個月之久，眞正叫我不開心：那就是說，你那小小的短簡，也叫我歡迎之不暇。</p>
<p>我希望你現在在好好地過着，十月裏就會回到我們地方來。至於我自己，我想我不會到什麽地方去；我將住在鄉間，在洞開的窗前和園中，度過我的全日。</p>
<p>我們已經彼此答應—是不是？—至少要做成偉大的朋友。假使你老是不肯改變你的心思的話！爲了應許總是沒有束縛力的；這些事情總不能隨意命令着。我們彼此切近地度過我們的一生，也許是一件美事，對於這件事，　簡直有些不敢相信，而我們的一生是被我們的夢所催眠着的，我們的夢：是你的愛國夢，我們的博愛夢，以及我們的科學夢。</p>
<p>在這些夢中，我相信最後的一個夢才是合適的。我以爲我們可有努力夾改變社會秩序，甚至我們有權力時，我們也不知道做些什麼；我們如果要有所活動，不管這活動朝着什麽方向，我們也決不敢說，我們不會阻礙某種不可免的進化，以致弄得害多於利。反之，從科學觀點看來，我們可以希望做些事情；這處的地土要更加堅實些，我們所昨作成的任何發現，總可以作爲獲得的知識。</p>
<p>看事情怎樣的安排：我們已經同意要做成偉大的朋友，但是如果你在一年之內就離開法國，那就成爲太柏拉圖式的友誼了，這是兩個人永遠不再見的友誼。你和我住在　起，不更好麽？我知道這個問題要使你發怒，也知道你不要再提起這句話此外，還有，不論從那一方面看來，我覺得我是完全配不上你的，</p>
<p>我想請你答應我在夫里堡（Fribourg）和你作一個偶然的會見，不過，假如我沒有記錯的話，你在那兒只躭擱一天，這一天，你當然是要和我們的朋友哥伐爾期基（Kovalski）一家相處的。</p>
<p>對你很熟識的</p>
<p>比耶爾。居禮</p>
<p>一八九四年八月十日</p>
<h3>兩個成功者</h3>
<p>— 小英</p>
<p>「三叔！那麽營業方針……」</p>
<p>「不用問，不用問！」三叔暴跳如雷：截斷他姪兒的嚅嚅囁囁的間話：「總之，叔侄關係，情讓給你二百五十股，挑你發財！今天三點以前繳到××銀行，五千！聽懂嗎？三點以前，五千！」一</p>
<p>「是！是！但是……」</p>
<p>「不用「但是」，不用嚕囌，快去！」</p>
<p>于是，姪兒離開了三叔的公館，去想法子。丈人那裏商量一千，一月限期；賣掉一對訂婚戒，七……凑集五千的數目是……尋同事老劉。</p>
<p>「好，老張，成全，成全你，我拚三千！」</p>
<p>沒有話說，不道樣將失信於三叔，最主要的是失掉了發財的機會。於是，五千撥款單換來的股款收據，存在，不！放在老劉處。</p>
<p>創立會上，一致推崇三叔爲董事長。於是第一砲，三叔把去年買進的一注房產，値八十六萬老法幣，以一百三十萬過戶給公司。</p>
<p>開業了。公司的股票隨即也在股票市塲上開拍。買進脾子掛「二十六」，沒有人賣出；掛「三十」，也沒有：掛……</p>
<p>不錯，沒有人會賣出。五百萬股本祇有一百萬外股。五萬股散戶都是那些「姪兒」之類的可憐人物，他們不知就裏，正驚喜若在，伸長了頭在望：漲！漲！漲！而掛買進牌子的主動者，正是握有二十萬股的發起人，也即　董監事，哪來人賣出？</p>
<p>他們故意放空氣」，暗抬「自己」的股票行情，使手裏沒有這種股票的「投資者們，看到「盛况絕後」豈不眼紅？於是掛它媽的一塊買進牌子：「四十！」</p>
<p>立刻來了反響：賣出牌子掛出來了：「四十五！劈劈拍拍的就此拍起板來，四十二，四十三……十萬股散開來了。</p>
<p>十萬股，也即是四百三四十萬洋鈿到了發起人也即是董監事諸君的手裏。而他們，還握有十萬股。他們撈回了本鈿（四百萬），收着了賺頭（三四十萬），還有十萬股在握，還是董監事，還可以　該公司的生殺之權！</p>
<p>尤其是，三叔是大大的成功了，股票上，房　上都有了利潤。</p>
<p>我們未免太冷落了「姪兒」罪過！那麼，……</p>
<p>娃兒老張夢寐裏也時時笑醒，推推他的妻說：</p>
<p>「四十四了，換一句話說，你仍舊可以套戒指，我還可以有一千五六百或者不止這數目……」</p>
<p>「記得麼？明天爸的那筆錢，他自己不做生意放給你的。」</p>
<p>「明天？」</p>
<p>於是明天，他與老劉商量：</p>
<p>「我要還債，請你把這「條條兒」一起賣了如何？」</p>
<p>「看漲！老張，明天還要漲！」</p>
<p>一明天？但是……</p>
<p>「不用「但是」，不用嚕囌，明天一准到五十！」</p>
<p>「老劉，幫幫忙，今天我要派用塲，看漲，那麼借我一千，出你三分息？」</p>
<p>「錢？統統在股票上，明天賣了借給你！」</p>
<p>「明天……」</p>
<p>又一「成功」者的姪兒老張，心裏攪混了酣酸，苦辣，各種各樣的滋味。</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 向家支</p>
<p>一二　后庭花</p>
<p>黃龍束着一根腰帶，維城就從黃龍背　，把他的腰帶扯住，扯的他把已經跨出門口的那隻脚　縮回來。維城告訴他：陳老太太已是年高的人，風燭殘年，沒幾年好活了，我們不忍心殺害她，這是一；我們要報仇，只有找到仇人的兒于，仇人的女兒，不該去扯到仇人的父母，這是二。黃龍從新關了門，點點頭道：「那是你預備找他們的兒子女兒了。維城望着屋樑應道：「是的。」維城說這話，說得太遲緩了一些，黃龍往床上一坐，把躁急的脾氣，忽然變的和緩了，一笑道：「聽翠珍姊說，姓陳的一個兒子一個女兒，到過世德堂，那女兒喚什麽芳，還和你很說得來。哼，我怕你舉得起這隻手來殺那個兒子，就舉不起那隻手來殺那個女兒。」維城給他說的臉上紅紅的，走過來，舉起手往黃龍肩膀上一拍，說道：「你太瞧不起我了，我……我不是這樣的人，我不是會爲了私情忘却大義的人，呵，你太瞧不起我了。」</p>
<p>黃龍反過手來，把維城的胳膊重重的揑了一把，笑道：「我沒有瞧不起你，我不過是這樣說說罷了。維城哥，我們還是好朋友。」維城道：「直等我說了，你才相信我，可見你以前對於我的認識不深，黃龍哥，好了好了，我們枉爲十幾年的朋友了。」黃龍想不到自己說了幾句話，所得到的結果會是這樣，這只得反過來向他道歉。維城道：「一點，你得注意，我雖然沒了父親母親，可是依然還有家庭，有着和母親一樣恩重如山的嬸娘，我不能連嬸娘都不顧，闖了禍往外一跑，便不顧家裏，所以該做的機密。至於說這是漂亮的女人，這是我的惟一的情人，那可全不在我心上，我只認得她是我的仇人的女兒，她便是仇人。」黃龍笑道：「好了好了，不必再說下去了，明天我和你往上海。」　（二四五）</p>

<h3>Abolishing the Custom of Christmas</h3>
<p>Christmas is less than a week away. According to past practices, ordinary believers and fashionable friends will take this opportunity to enjoy a night of revelry; and general stores and entertainment venues will also rack their brains and compete to attract customers, trying to make a profit. Originally, in times of peace, these things would not be worthy of attention. But this year's situation is different! This year, Shanghai is within the scope of the Greater East Asia War. What lies before us is no longer a life of drunken dreams or singing and dancing, but a time when every citizen needs to take on a part of the responsibility of the war—no one can escape the impact of the war. Therefore, for this year's Christmas, we must prepare new ways of celebration! More meaningful ways of celebration!</p>
<p>The teachings of Jesus consist of only two words: "Universal Love"! When we celebrate Christmas, we must first commemorate Jesus' spirit of universal love. We should ask ourselves, every believer, do we have the "precious blood" that Jesus passed on to us—the blood of sacrificing oneself to save fellow countrymen in distress! Celebrating Christmas without this kind of blood, and deliberately turning a blind eye to the suffering, distressed, hungry, and cold compatriots around us while celebrating Christmas, all violate the spirit of Jesus' universal love. This is like a camel trying to pass through the eye of a needle!</p>
<p>For this reason, we piously propose to the tens of thousands of Christians in Shanghai that on the eve of Christmas, they abolish all unnecessary extravagance, save the money spent on large stores, large tea houses, large hotels, and dance halls, and concentrate it on rescuing the tens of thousands of suffering compatriots in Shanghai who have no clothes, no food, and no home, so that they can be warm and fed, have a place to live, and have the opportunity to learn skills to support themselves! In this difficult environment, this is the work that every Christian should and can do most! In the spirit of Jesus sacrificing himself for universal love, every Christian should rise up to oppose the senseless waste of Christmas and promote the movement to save the poor!</p>
<p>At the same time, we want to solemnly inform the general non-Christians that they must not use Christmas for merrymaking again. Moreover, this kind of custom was originally a custom of the British and Americans, so why bother to imitate it? They should save all the expenses on tea houses, hotels, and dance halls, and do something that is helpful to society and the community! Come and rescue those poor and helpless compatriots! You must know that only when those factors that trap people in poverty and helplessness disappear from society—all the selfish and self-interested psychology and actions that ignore the lives of others—can society truly prosper. Only then will it be worth celebrating!</p>
<p>Let the universal love in everyone's heart be manifested in everyone's actions! Christmas is an opportunity for each of us to show this kind of love!</p>

<h3>Regarding the Food Problem, the Japanese Authorities Issue a Statement, China and Japan Reach a New Understanding on Food Management, and the Authority of the Food Management Committee Will Be Further Strengthened in the Future</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Embassy in China recently issued the following statement regarding the food problem: The Executive Yuan of the National Government, the Food Management Committee, and the Japanese military authorities have reached a new understanding on the protection of food administration concerning rice. From now on, the rice management power of the Food Management Committee will be further expanded and strengthened, and the Japanese military authorities will also fully cooperate in the adjustment of rice and other matters, promote the increase of rice supply, and suppress the rise in rice prices, eliminating various anxieties about food in the past. It is expected that this kind of Sino-Japanese cooperation under the adaptation to the needs of the times will further stabilize people's livelihood and make a significant contribution to the Greater East Asia War. Food is essential for people's livelihood and is also an element of social security. It is also extremely important for the cultivation of war power. Therefore, all countries are doing the same. The peaceful areas under the rule of the National Government have extremely abundant sources of rice, which are used to adjust food prices, transport quickly, and crack down on the small-scale activities of general profiteers. It is expected that in the future, with the assistance of the Japanese army, the Food Management Committee will be able to complete its tasks more easily, and the food problem will also be easier to solve. The embassy has great expectations for the activities of the Food Management Committee in the future and will provide possible assistance in the same way as the Japanese military authorities. Finally, it is hoped that the Chinese and Japanese people will fully cooperate with the committee's rice supply and demand adjustment and that the Food Management Committee will be able to complete its important mission under control.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) - In modern long-term wars, the food problem is one of the most important sectors of the war. Governments of all countries implement strict controls on food production, distribution, consumption, and prices, striving to ensure the main food supply. Fortunately, the Central China region is rich in food, and the necessity of control has always been recognized. However, with the prolongation of the war, the gradual strengthening of control is an inevitable trend. The rice problem is not only a problem for the Chinese people, but also a direct problem for the military from the perspective of security and other aspects. The Japanese military has always been extremely concerned about its security and has made every effort and cooperation. The rice in Central China is not fundamentally insufficient. The main reason for its sluggish turnover lies in the profiteers who seek huge profits and instigate speculation and hoarding, as well as the activities of general unscrupulous elements who are manipulated by them in secret. These bad behaviors must be eliminated as soon as possible. It is permitted that the rise in rice prices will inevitably affect people's livelihood. It is now decided that from January 1, a certain adjustment of rice and grain will be stipulated, and prices will be adhered to. Chinese and Japanese institutions will cooperate to eliminate the instigation and speculation of these profiteers. Those who violate this policy will be severely punished without leniency. The acquisition of rice is limited in principle to the minimum necessary extent recognized by the Japanese military. Other matters are under the control of the Food Management Committee. The committee has recently made extraordinary efforts to achieve remarkable results and is moving towards ensuring people's livelihood. The Japanese military will spare no effort to actively assist the committee in its tasks of procurement, allocation, and price adjustment, and cooperate with each other to formulate appropriate food countermeasures in order to ensure the main food supply and stabilize people's livelihood. It is deeply hoped that the Chinese and Japanese people will understand the intentions of the Japanese military, promote the smooth turnover and distribution, and strive for regular consumption, so that China and Japan can share the joys and sorrows and work together to complete the Greater East Asia War.</p>

<h3>The Decisive Battle Continues (1) Broadcast Speech by Mr. Hiraide, Chief of the Naval Information Department, Translated from the December 8th "Yomiuri Hochi"</h3>
<p>At 8:00 p.m. on the 7th, Colonel Hiraide Hideo, Chief of the Naval Information Department of the Imperial Headquarters, delivered a nationwide broadcast on the AK Radio Station entitled "The Decisive Battle Continues." The five most noteworthy points in the broadcast speech are as follows: (1) Due to the destruction of the enemy's core naval forces and the capture of key points, our side has established a superior offensive position. (2) Attacks on the enemy in the Solomon Islands area alone are not enough to speak of overall victory. (3) Explain the current strength of the US Navy and warn against the misconception of some people that "the US fleet has been completely annihilated." Our new battleships and aircraft carriers are being commissioned one after another. (5) Clarify that continuing victory is not the final victory and urge the people to be aware.</p>
<p>It has been a year since the start of the Greater East Asia War. Our Rising Sun Flag and Naval Ensign are fluttering in the wind everywhere in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, which is admirable and inspiring. Who could have imagined that this was possible a year ago today? Thanks to the mighty imperial power, we have sailed smoothly and left so many achievements behind. This is the first point to recognize clearly. Although the enemy has been defeated, they still maintain abundant material resources and strong production capacity, and they are still attempting stubborn counterattacks. However, no matter how they respond, we must hit them with a heavy blow to silence them. On this second December 8th, which the people do not want to forget and cannot forget, we review the naval war situation in the past year and look forward to the future progress, hoping that everyone will renew their determination to destroy the enemy.</p>
<p>Overview of the War Situation in One Year</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War was provoked by the United States. At that time, the enemy had already prepared for war and launched a plan to wage war against Japan on December 8. Through the forced reconnaissance of aircraft and ships in the waters near Japan, the torpedo attacks of submarines, and even the attacks of other submarines in the western waters of Hawaii, and so on, there was no end to it. Finally, it brought our empire to the final juncture of survival. After reading the Declaration of War, the soldiers of our Imperial Army rose up in anger. On the naval front, in the first battles of Pearl Harbor and the Strait of Malacca, we destroyed the core of the enemy's naval and air power, dealing a profound blow to the enemy's combat power. In terms of transoceanic operations, securing control of the air and sea is the first key to victory, and we had already accomplished this with a surprise attack. The joint operations of our army and navy were launched in various places. The enemy's bases and key points in Wake Island, Guam, Malaya, the Philippines, Sumatra, Borneo, Java, etc., were successively defeated. The iron chain of encirclement against Japan, which the enemy boasted of being strong and unyielding before the war, was finally shattered. Since the first battle, our side has established the cornerstone of a superior offensive position.</p>
<p>In addition to securing the necessary footholds, our navy did not forget to adopt a new offensive posture. For example, the Indian Ocean operation in early April and the East Pacific operation in early August. In the Indian Ocean, we advanced from the Andaman Islands to Colombo and Trincomalee. In the East Pacific, we raided the Aleutian Islands and Midway.</p>
<p>Since then, our control of the air and sea has been expanded and strengthened day by day, and the enemy's defeated posture has become more and more profound. In this way, the empire has embarked on the road to prosperity, both strategically and economically.</p>

During counter-attacks, Italian forces even improved their positions, capturing a considerable amount of war materiel. Fighting continues southeast of Toropets, where large units of Soviet troops are encircled. One portion has already been annihilated, and the encirclement of the remaining troops is steadily shrinking. Soviet forces attempted desperate counter-attacks to break through the encirclement, but gained nothing except heavy losses. Fierce fighting continues in the Rzhev area. Although Soviet forces have a numerical advantage, the outcome remains uncertain. Military circles in Berlin are paying close attention to the German offensive against Soviet forces southwest of Stalingrad, as the German advance is proceeding along three axes: east, west, and south. When German "Stuka" aircraft bombed Murmansk, the port suffered heavy damage. Docks and warehouses were set ablaze, and large quantities of Soviet supplies stored there were completely destroyed.</p>
<p>Seventh Dispatch from the Universal News Service, Berlin: German military circles, commenting on the fighting in the southern sector of the Eastern Front, stated that fierce fighting has taken place north of the Terek River in the past few days. Heavy Soviet losses, including 31 destroyed tanks, prove that Soviet attempts to break through German lines in the area have come at a high price. To defend the northern flank of their Eastern Caucasus front, Soviet forces concentrated their troops north of the Terek River. However, the Germans anticipated this and launched an offensive on December 12, preempting the Soviets. The German forces penetrated deep into enemy lines. To halt the German advance, the Soviets attempted flanking maneuvers under heavy artillery cover. In the first day of fighting, eight Soviet tanks were destroyed. The following day, the Soviets committed large numbers of fresh troops, but the Germans held their ground and destroyed 17 tanks. By December 14, the Soviets launched another attack. A German engineering unit was temporarily cut off, allowing the enemy to enter German lines, but they were quickly repelled. The Soviets lost another six tanks. According to the latest news received on Monday evening, Soviet operations in the area had completely failed. Both sides' air forces were very active on Monday. German fighter planes shot down four enemy aircraft in aerial combat.</p>
<p>Seventeenth Dispatch from the Universal News Service, Berlin: It was announced here today that German and allied forces have annihilated the encircled Soviet troops in the Toropets region, killing 10,050 Soviet soldiers, capturing 4,217, and destroying 542 Soviet tanks and armored vehicles, 447 heavy and light artillery pieces, and a large quantity of other military equipment.</p>
<h3>Japanese Minister to Vietnam Arrives in Saigon</h3>
<p>Seventeenth Dispatch from Domei News Agency, Saigon: Kuriyama, the Japanese Minister to French Indochina and Secretary-General of the Japanese Embassy office, returned here today from Japan and immediately conferred with Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam Yoshizawa. While in Tokyo, Kuriyama discussed with central authorities the economic negotiations between Japan and Vietnam scheduled to begin early next year.</p>
<h3>Active Axis Air Force on the Tunisian Front - The Focus of the Libyan Theater Shifts Near Tripoli</h3>
<p>Seventeenth Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Lisbon: According to news received here on the 16th, large-scale operations on the Tunisian front have been hampered by continuous torrential rains. Both sides are only actively consolidating their lines and conducting patrol activities, causing the fighting to enter a lull. However, Axis air forces remain unusually active, braving the adverse weather to heavily bomb Allied positions and air bases. German fighter squadrons attacked Allied airfields near Bona, strafing enemy aircraft on the ground with machine guns and shooting down several enemy aircraft that came to intercept them. In addition, bomber squadrons heavily bombed several Allied bases in eastern Algeria. Therefore, air superiority over the Tunisian front is now completely in the hands of the Axis air force. Furthermore, the Axis forces have dispatched large numbers of reinforcements, who are continuously landing at the ports of Tunis and Bizerte, and using the numerous railways in the area to quickly move to the front lines. Moreover, Rommel's forces on the Cyrenaica front have engaged in fierce fighting with the British forces advancing along the coast, repelling all the British forces.</p>
<p>Seventeenth Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Berlin: According to German military authorities, the center of operations on the Cyrenaica front, which began on the 12th, has now shifted to the vicinity of the border between Cyrenaica and Tripolitania. The British forces have concentrated large numbers of troops in a short period of time after occupying the transport bases of Tobruk and Benghazi, outnumbering the Axis forces. Strategically, to avoid encirclement, the Axis forces have begun to retreat. The German air force has repeatedly conducted night raids on Tobruk and Benghazi, disrupting British transport, making it difficult for the British forces to sustain their attacks. Initially, the British Eighth Army attempted to encircle General Rommel from the flank on the El Agheila line, but was met with strong German counter-attacks, preventing its success and inflicting heavy casualties. There is widespread criticism within Britain of the miscalculations in the British operation.</p>
<p>Seventeenth Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Berlin: According to German military authorities, the British Eighth Army on the Cyrenaica front has been hampered by Axis minefields, suffering heavy losses. Yesterday morning, British forces on the northern coast attacked German minefields led by General Rommel. The commander of the British Eighth Army, Montgomery, also used tanks and mechanized units to attack the Axis forces' flank from the south. Despite being numerically superior, the British forces were defeated by the Germans. Axis tank units were very active in the battle, inflicting heavy casualties on the British and destroying a large number of tanks, trucks, and heavy artillery pieces. According to American broadcasts, the Germans have laid mines everywhere, preventing the British from advancing, while Axis tank units are using the narrow terrain to launch fierce attacks on the British vanguard.</p>
<h3>German and British Announce Lifting of Shackles on Prisoners of War</h3>
<p>Seventeenth Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Berlin: The Swiss government notified the governments of Germany, Britain, and Canada on December 8, requesting that each country remove shackles from prisoners of war. According to British and Canadian authorities, they removed the shackles from prisoners of war on the 12th. It is understood that the German government also intends to take similar measures, but German diplomatic authorities have not yet released the contents of the reply, stating only that diplomatic negotiations are not yet concluded.</p>
<h3>Darlan Issues Inaugural Statement as U.S. Envoy - I Have No Ambition to Cling to Power - Will Retire Once the Political Situation Stabilizes</h3>
<p>Sixteenth Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Lisbon: In light of frequent criticisms regarding the appointment of Darlan, the British and American governments recently held discussions to address the issue. As a result, Roosevelt instructed military authorities to request that Darlan issue a statement addressing his appointment as chairman of the new regime. According to a broadcast from Algiers radio station, Darlan met with correspondents from British and American newspapers on the 16th and made a statement, the gist of which was: "My only hope is to save the motherland. In the future, what kind of political system the motherland adopts, or what kind of national policy it decides, must be determined by the general will of the French people. As far as I am personally concerned, I have no ambition. I have decided to retire from politics as soon as France is liberated." He also mentioned the repeal of the laws discriminating against Jews, stating that "laws regarding racial discrimination will be abolished, and other political prisoners will also be released." Therefore, judging from Darlan's words above, the dispute over establishing a new puppet regime may have temporarily come to an end in form, but the internal opposition among the anti-Axis countries caused by the appointment of Darlan is still quite deep. For example, the Chicago Daily News reported that Soviet Ambassador to the United States Litvinov visited Secretary of State Hull at the State Department, expressing the Soviet government's opposition to the appointment of Darlan, which is sufficient to prove the disagreements among the anti-Axis countries.</p>

<h3>Japanese Air Force Launches Fierce Attack on Guilin Air Base - Airfield and Aircraft Heavily Damaged - Japanese Aircraft Encountered Little Resistance</h3>
<p>Seventeenth Dispatch from Domei News Agency, An Aviation Base of the Japanese Army in China: It was disclosed today that Japanese Army fighter planes and bombers launched a fierce attack on the Guilin air base in Guangxi Province on Tuesday afternoon, destroying the airfield runways and heavily damaging nearby military facilities. American-made Curtiss P-40 fighter planes were set on fire. Japanese aircraft circled over the airfield, preparing for the attack, and spotted a patrolling Curtiss P-40 enemy aircraft, which hastily fled. The Japanese aircraft did not pursue, but passed through dense clouds obstructing visibility and dropped bombs on four large aircraft in the north and south corners of the airfield, setting them ablaze. Ignoring intense anti-aircraft fire, the Japanese aircraft continued to drop bombs on the airfield, completely destroying the runways and nearby military facilities.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents in North China Plan to Establish Educational Institutions</h3>
<p>Seventeenth Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Beijing: The number of Japanese residents in various parts of North China and Mengjiang has been increasing in recent years.

<h3>Severe Disaster Situation in Guilin Province - Heavy Losses of Crops</h3>
<p>In the first half of this year, 32 counties in Guilin Province suffered from floods, including Yangshuo, Pingle, Gongcheng, Hexian, Zhaoping, and Cangwu. 32 counties suffered from droughts, including Lingchuan, Yongfu, Cenxi, Pingnan, Liujiang, and Rong. 14 counties suffered from insect pests, including Guanyang, Zhaoping, Mengshan, Lipu, and Gongcheng. 6 counties suffered from wind and hail, including Zhaoping, Yishan, Wuming, and Leye. As a result, crop losses were quite high. It is estimated that the reduction in rice production was 874,867 dan, upland rice 833.73 dan, corn 644,294 dan, and other crops 114,585 dan. The number of victims reached more than 300,000, which cannot be said to be not serious.</p>
<p>As of September, the Guilin Provincial Disaster Relief Reserve Fund Management Committee allocated 250,000 yuan for the urgent relief of 13 counties that suffered relatively severe floods, including Guanyang, Yongning, Bobai, and Yulin. As for the other 6 counties that suffered less severe floods, such as Yangshuo and Donglan, each county used its own disaster relief reserve fund for relief work. There are still many places that have not received relief. For example, in Huaiji County, there were 63,038 starving people in August, of whom only 18,000 could eat rice and miscellaneous grains, and 20,000 ate miscellaneous grains and grass roots. The rest subsisted on things like banana roots and Tuckahoe. In Cangwu County, there were more than 100,000 disaster victims, and the Provincial Disaster Relief Reserve Fund Committee only allocated 5,000 yuan, which was of course of no help.</p>

Of these, about 50,000 volumes were lost after the outbreak of the incident. It was not until August of this year that it was learned that most of the books were stored in the French Concession in Shanghai. It was then planned to transport them back for preservation. In early November, 36 large boxes of Chinese books were transported back. Today, another 42 boxes of foreign books were transported back. The two shipments totaled 40,140 volumes.

<h3>Japanese General Manager of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Teraoka Kohei, Resigns - Transferred to New Position at the Japanese Embassy in Italy - Held Farewell Tea Party Yesterday at the Cathay Hotel</h3>
<p>An announcement from the Information Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council states that Mr. Teraoka Kohei, General Manager of the Council, has recently been ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Japanese Government to transfer to a new position at the Japanese Embassy in Italy and will soon depart for Rome. He has submitted his resignation to the Council, effective from the 20th of this month, which has been approved. The Council deeply regrets the resignation of General Manager Teraoka. Mr. Teraoka was appointed Deputy General Manager of the Council in February of the year before last, and then succeeded former General Manager Fessenden on March 1 of last year. According to the English-language China Press, Teraoka Kohei, the General Manager of the Shanghai Municipal Council, has been transferred to the position of Third Secretary at the Japanese Embassy in Rome and is expected to leave Shanghai next Monday for Tokyo before proceeding to Rome to take up his new post. His vacancy is expected to be filled by Mr. Ozawa, the former Japanese Consul-General in Xiamen. Mr. Teraoka held a tea party at the Cathay Hotel today (the 17th) from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. to say farewell to officials from all parties.</p>
<p>Farewell Tea Party</p>
<p>News from the Information Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council, General Manager Teraoka held a grand banquet at the Cathay Hotel on the Bund yesterday afternoon (the 17th) at 5 p.m. Invited guests included representatives from the diplomatic and consular corps, directors of the French Concession Public Works Bureau, directors of the Municipal Council, committee members, municipal authorities and staff from various agencies, officials from the Japanese Embassy and Consular Office, department heads and other staff from the Municipal Council, and over a hundred Chinese and foreign reporters.</p>
<p>Teraoka's Remarks</p>
<p>This morning (the 17th), Mr. Teraoka spoke to reporters about his views on Shanghai, saying that Shanghai, although facing adverse circumstances, has been able to continue to prosper because of three conditions: first, Shanghai is an international city, which has promoted its growth into one of the world's largest commercial ports; second, Shanghai is a relatively autonomous region, free from external interference; and third, Shanghai is still a free port to some extent, so commerce is quite prosperous. The above three factors are extremely important for Shanghai to continue to prosper and promote its economic development. If these conditions are maintained in the future, it will benefit China, Japan, and other countries, because Shanghai's great progress in the past depended on these conditions. No matter when peace is restored, Shanghai will eventually regain its former position as a major commercial port.</p>
<h3>Registration Measures for Gauze Products</h3>
<p>After the authorities handled the registration of cotton yarn and cotton cloth stocks, the registration of gauze products has also begun. The Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai specially convened representatives of the Japanese Textile Industry Association in China, the Central China Weaving Industry Association, and the China Scarf Dyeing Industry Association on the 15th to explain two matters: (1) Products manufactured by various textile industries after the 11th of this month must be registered with the Textile Industry Association in China every ten days. (2) Products manufactured by members of the Central China Weaving Industry Association and the China Dyeing Industry Association after the 11th of this month must be registered with their affiliated associations every three days.</p>
<p>Regarding the registration of gauze stocks, the Guild Affairs Bureau issued a notice stating that, as the Municipal Council is handling the registration of cotton yarn and cotton cloth items, a method has been previously stipulated, with a deadline of the 15th of this month, which has been advertised in the newspapers. Now that the deadline has passed, many have completed the registration as required, but due to the short time, a few may not have been able to complete it. In order to be thorough and considerate, the application deadline has been extended by five days, until the 20th of this month. Do not wait any longer, lest you be punished. It is a matter of your own interests, so please do not make a mistake.</p>
<h3>The Three Provinces Tax Bureau Completes Its Work</h3>
<p>Tax Collection Continues as Usual This Month</p>
<p>In order to adjust the tax structure, the Ministry of Finance, based on the proposal submitted by Shao, Director of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, has been approved by the Executive Yuan meeting to abolish the existing Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Tax Bureau from January 1 of next year. On the same day, tax bureaus and stamp tax and tobacco tax bureaus will be established in each of the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. A tax investigation office will also be established within the Taxation Department. All candidates for the heads of each bureau and office have been appointed and announced by the Ministry. After receiving the order, the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Tax Bureau convened a meeting of key officials to decide on the completion of the work. It is understood that the various departments of the bureau have recently been working hard to complete the work and have strictly ordered the local branch bureaus and offices to complete their work by the end of this month in order to complete the handover procedures on January 1 as scheduled. It is reported that tax collection is proceeding as usual in various places this month, and all industrialists and merchants are able to pay taxes according to law.</p>
<h3>Lieutenant Matsuda Discusses Impressions of Returning Home</h3>
<p>The English newspaper *The Times* reports that Lieutenant Matsuda of the Japanese Army Press Department, during a recent interview, shared his impressions of his trip to Tokyo. He stated that as a result of Japan's fierce struggle against Britain and America, it is natural that the activities of the Japanese people should be controlled. Furthermore, he dismissed as completely unfounded the enemy's rumors of a severe shortage of food for the Japanese people.</p>
<p>Although the scope of meat rationing in Japan cannot be compared to that before the war, the Japanese people naturally prefer fish, fruits, and vegetables. Therefore, during his trip, he did not hear a single person complain, as fish, fruits, and vegetables are still rationed as before. In general, after removing unnecessary items from the Japanese diet, signs of genuine health and joy are now visible on people's faces. He felt "astonished" when comparing the general health of the people of Shanghai with that of the people of Japan today. The Japanese people are united "like a spring," and their determination to destroy British and American imperialism in East Asia was fully displayed on the anniversary of the Great East Asia War on December 8th. Through the continuous lectures, parades, and mass rallies, one could appreciate the spirit of the Japanese people's all-out effort to win this "great war." The most prominent aspect of the Japanese people today is</p>
<p>air raid drills, air raid alerts, and preparations to strive for final victory. All citizens of Tokyo have been trained in drills to the point where they are not afraid of enemy aircraft attacks, and air defense equipment is becoming increasingly sophisticated, sufficient to deal with the possibility of air raids. Lieutenant Matsuda concluded by saying that the people of Tokyo continuously go to the plaza in front of the Imperial Palace, kneeling and praying day and night for the Emperor's safety and for Japan to achieve its goals. He said he was deeply impressed by this.</p>

<h3>Extended Entertainment Hours on the Nights of the 24th and 31st</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued Notice No. 6209, stating briefly that entertainment venues within the International Settlement will be permitted to operate until 2:00 AM on December 24th and 31st of this year, but must comply with all air defense measures stipulated by the authorities.</p>
<h3>Food Problem Forum</h3>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>I recently went to the countryside, only a few dozen *li* from Shanghai. This area is known for its rice production, and this year's harvest was particularly bountiful, with rice piled high like mountains. The farmers were overjoyed. The price of rice was only 220 yuan per *dan*, and unpolished rice was even less than 200 yuan. Compared to the price of 1,000 yuan per *dan* in Shanghai, there is a difference of four or five times. Even considering the prices inside and outside the blockade line, the difference is more than double. Ordinary people are only allowed to carry two *sheng*. If they exceed this limit, it will be confiscated. However, ordinary poor people can bring rice cakes and dumplings along with white rice. The quantity of rice cakes is also limited, roughly to five *jin* per person! Outside the blockade line, one can see a long, snake-like line of people, each holding a bundle of rice cakes, waiting for the designated time to open the line. If we calculate for them, carrying once a day can save them dozens of yuan! This kind of abnormal situation is not something that should exist in a normal society. Within the realm of possibility, we should always think of ways for the people.</p>
<p>Secondly, even if the order restricting the transport of grain cannot be revoked due to government regulations or other inconveniences, we hope that the authorities can consider the food needs of all the people and allow Shanghai's grain agencies to purchase from inland production areas. Because, in fact, the inland production has always been sufficient for inland consumption with a surplus. The reason why the surplus was not very visible in previous years may be due to hoarding, private collection, and private sales. However, this year, security has been restored in various places, and all goods have price limits, so there will not be as much chaos as in the past. If the Shanghai authorities can earnestly purchase surplus grain from various places, transport it to ration to Shanghai residents, and truly implement production and sales control, then its effectiveness will certainly not be less than the first point. As for the necessary expenses, arrangements can be made with the banking community, providing them with considerable benefits, which would also be an excellent investment objective.</p>
<p>However, the most fundamental point that must be done first is to increase the amount of household rice rations. This is almost a unanimous demand. If the above point can be realized and the quantity of household rice can be appropriately adjusted, then I believe the grain panic can be quickly resolved. (You Yang)</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>I have more than ten *mu* of land in the countryside, some of which I rent out for cultivation, and some of which I cultivate jointly with others (they provide the labor, and I provide the fertilizer). According to this year's harvest, it is a bumper year, with each *mu* yielding more than two and a half *shi*. Sadly, I cannot bring a single grain of rice to Shanghai for my own consumption. The current price limit in the countryside is 220 yuan. If I buy the rice I produce and then buy rice in Shanghai (the household rice is really not enough to eat, and I have ten people in my family, the youngest of whom is already fourteen years old), it can be said that my harvest per *mu* is only six *dou*, completely consumed by tax grain, not even enough for my seed. So, for others, it may be a year of plenty, but for me, it is a year of famine and hunger, truly fitting Mencius' saying, "Manure their fields, and still there is not enough; then they borrow and add to their indebtedness."

<h3>Wholesale Edible Oil Distribution Office to Implement New Retail System Starting the Day After Tomorrow: Sales Based on Housing Tax Receipts and Household Registration Certificates; Retailers Limited to Paying and Picking Up Goods for Market</h3>
<p>In order to alleviate the difficulty for the public in purchasing edible oil and to prevent profiteering, the Shanghai Edible Oil Trade Wholesale Office, with the approval of the military allocation authorities, will implement a new system for purchasing edible oil based on housing tax receipts and household registration certificates starting on the 20th of this month. The regulations are as follows: (1) Public Settlement: autumn housing tax receipt stub; (2) French Concession: September and October housing tax receipt stub; (3) Nanshi, Zhabei, Huxi, and Pudong: each household registration certificate. Regarding the quantity sold this month, those with housing tax receipts can purchase two *shi jin*, including attached households; those with household registration certificates can purchase half a *jin*. A Commercial News Agency reporter learned from the Edible Oil Wholesale Office yesterday that there are a total of 1,830 edible oil retail stores in the city. The maximum quantity allocated each day is 17 *dan* and 20 *jin*, and the minimum is 12.5 *jin*. All retail stores selling edible oil will have signs at the entrance indicating the price and quantity of oil sold for identification. Both the public and government employees will be sold on the same basis. The sales time is from 9:00 AM until sold out. Prices, including taxes, are as follows: (1) raw oil, 7.40 yuan per *jin*; (2) soybean oil, 7.10 yuan per *jin*; (3) rapeseed oil, 6.20 yuan per *jin*. The office will also send personnel to supervise the sale of edible oil at each retail store. These investigators will have identification cards and investigation certificates issued by the office. Regarding the total monthly allocation of 20,000 *dan*, all retail stores have been required to pay for the oil before the 20th and pick up the goods from the designated oil warehouses, with sales starting simultaneously on the 20th.</p>
<h3>Controlled Purchase of Cotton; Crackdown on Adulteration</h3>
<p>Cotton Industry Supervision Office Established in Jiangsu Province</p>
<p>After the Cotton Control Association implemented controlled purchases, the authorities in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, on the one hand, reached an agreement with the Control Association on the minimum purchase price of cotton per *dan*, and on the other hand, the Department of Construction established the Cotton Industry Supervision Office to actively promote cotton inspection and strictly prohibit adulteration. According to a Commercial News Agency reporter, the Cotton Industry Supervision Office of the Jiangsu Department of Construction has decided to establish four offices, namely, "Xiwu District," "Changtai District," "Songqing District," and "Ningzhen District." The heads of the district offices have already been appointed. It is also reported that a supervision office is also being planned in Zhejiang province.</p>
<h3>Datong Weaving and Dyeing Factory Thrives</h3>
<p>The Datong Weaving and Dyeing Factory was initiated and established in the autumn of the 28th year of the Republic (1939) by Zhu Xuchang, Chen Jiuru, Wang Xingyao, Zhu Mintang, Gao Chengyuan, and more than ten other figures from the financial and industrial sectors. Zhu Xuchang serves as the chairman of the board. Equipped with new-style machinery and managed strictly, the factory produces rich silk bedsheets, brocade crepe bedsheets, colored twill bedsheets, tablecloths, tea towels, etc., all with unique designs, exquisite workmanship, and durability. They are sold both locally and abroad and are widely welcomed. The initial capital was 240,000 yuan. Over the past three years, due to the flourishing business, the factory has gradually expanded, increasing its capital annually. The total capital has now increased to 6 million yuan. It holds Business Registration Certificate No. 33 issued by the Ministry of Industry. The factory is located at 372 Daxi Road, and the distribution offices are located at 33 Sichuan Road, No. 710.</p>
<p>Mechanical Equipment</p>
<p>The factory site covers eight *mu*, with forty-two newly built sawtooth-style factory buildings, four finishing and sewing rooms, ten dyeing rooms, two printing rooms, one furnace room, and dozens of warehouses and machine rooms. The weaving machinery includes eighteen 106-inch wide all-iron automatic looms, seventeen 106-inch wide iron-wood jacquard looms, eighteen iron-wood automatic 106-inch wide plain looms, six iron-wood dobby looms, and thirty-two hand-operated jacquard looms (producing patterned bath towels, terrycloth blankets, dishcloths, etc.). There are also two automatic warping machines, two American all-iron bobbin winders with 300 spindles each, one bowl-type bobbin winder with 60 spindles, one all-iron cone winder with 100 spindles, two flanged cone winders with 150 spindles each, one 42-inch hydroextractor, one copper seven-roller ironing machine, twenty-four spindle all-iron candlewick machines, two ball-type candlewick all-iron machines, two all-iron large lathes, and four small lathes, six American sewing machines.</p>
<p>Production Situation</p>
<p>The total power is 85 horsepower, with a complete set of water heating equipment, one American horizontal boiler, one 400-foot deep artesian well, one I-beam all-iron water tower, and other miscellaneous machinery including two cooking pots, one all-iron dyeing vat, and sixteen new-style steel-concrete washing pools. If the factory operates day and night, it can produce more than 800 bedsheets per day. However, since the restriction of electricity, the output has been slightly reduced. Datong rich silk bedsheets were once very popular. Tablecloths and tea towels are commonly used by new-style Shanghai restaurants such as Xindu, Hongmian, Xinya, Wanshoushan, and Mei Hua all year round. The business is flourishing, and supply cannot meet demand. In the first half of this year, a total of more than 170,000 items were produced, with sales reaching more than 1.6 million yuan. The sales figures for the second half of the year are even higher, with 60% in Shanghai and 40% in other areas, making it the leader in the industry. This is largely due to the management of Zhu Mintang, the manager of the factory, and the efforts of Gao Chengyuan, the factory director, in planning the factory affairs and designing the products are also an important factor.</p>

<h3>Prohibition of Spitting</h3>
<p>— Yi Wu</p>
<p>Recently, the municipal authorities are rigorously enforcing the prohibition of spitting. On several important roads, if someone spits, they will be fined five yuan in Central Reserve Certificates if discovered by the police.</p>
<p>Sputum is a secretion of the mucous membranes of the trachea and bronchi in the human body. It is most abundant during a cold. Sputum often contains tubercle bacilli. When it dries on the ground, the tubercle bacilli mix with dust and fly into the air. Others can easily become infected with tuberculosis by inhaling it. Therefore, spitting everywhere is indeed harmful to public health.</p>
<p>Although the people of the world are said to have differences in race, such as yellow, white, red, black, and brown, there are no fundamentally different structures in the human body. However, without any sense of inferiority, we always feel that the sputum of our people is more than that of foreigners. If you don't believe it, please look at the roads, in front of shops, at tram stops, in vegetable markets, and in all public places, where the ground can be said to be covered everywhere with green, blue, and yellow sputum. The most annoying thing is that when walking on the road, suddenly, like a stray bullet, a mouthful of thick phlegm flies out of the tram or from inside the shop counter, hitting the pedestrian's face accurately.</p>
<p>Of the same quality but different name as sputum is nasal mucus. Chinese people have a lot of sputum, and of course, nasal mucus is also small and rare. On the road, you can often see people humming nasal mucus. Some of the postures are like throwing a discus, and some are like dropping a hand grenade. It goes without saying that others are innocent and suffer.</p>
<p>Perhaps people who are accustomed to spitting and humming nasal mucus say; if you don’t spit or hum, is it possible to swallow it? In fact, that's not the way to say it. Wouldn't it be solved by carrying a handkerchief or some paper?</p>
<p>What are only the bad habits of Chinese people, spitting everywhere? On the snow-white wall, there is a big black sign that says: "No Urinating"; but pedestrians turn a blind eye and insist on urinating there.</p>
<p>In the past, our great politician Zichan said: "Fire is fierce, and people look up to it and fear it, so few die from it. Water is weak, and people are familiar with it and play with it, so many die from it. Therefore, tolerance is difficult." Now, people who spit everywhere are fined in Central Reserve Certificates yuan. I think if we can implement it seriously, at least the number of people spitting can be reduced a lot. This is indeed a matter beneficial to the city, and I hope it can be carried out actively.</p>
<h3>Curie's Letter Request (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Written by Lincoln Schuster, Translated by Gu Xin</p>
<p>— One of the Letters of World-Famous Scientists</p>
<p>Background: In 1893, although Pierre Curie was not well known in France, he was well-known throughout the rest of Europe because of his fundamental research on magnetism and other parts of physics. He completed a highly sensitive electrometry method called the "Curie electrometer." Sir Kelvin publicly acknowledged him as an authority in the field of science. For his creative and great scientific work and for coaching thirty students, the French government gave him a salary of three hundred francs a month when he was thirty-five years old—the salary of a perfect factory worker. His title was "Director of the Experimental Laboratory of the School of Physical Chemistry in the City of Paris."</p>
<p>He had few friends, who said, "Pierre Curie devoted his body and mind to scientific research,"… "He did not love anyone." In his diary, he once wrote, "There are few women of genius."</p>
<p>Later, Pierre Curie met Marie Sklodowska. ... She came from Warsaw, studied at the Sorbonne, passed the physics exam the year before, and was preparing for the math exam at the time. They met at the home of a friend they both knew, and their conversation at that time can be described in the words of their daughter Eve Curie: "Soon it turned into a scientific dialogue. … Marie, with some timidity and respect, asked questions and listened to Pierre's opinions. He explained his plans, described the phenomena of crystallography, he was simply fascinated by crystallography, and he was working on it at the time. What a miracle it was for this physicist to use specialized names, complicated formulas, talk about the work he loved to a woman, and see her, charming and young, energetic, understand his words, and even discuss some situations with him with clear and accurate insights? … How wonderful it is! "</p>
<p>This is how the friendship began, and Pierre Curie "promoted it with gentle stubbornness." In the laboratory, she wore "a large linen shirt, silently leaning over the instrument." After seeing her like this, he sent her a copy of his recently published book: "Coordination of Physical Phenomena: Coordination of Electrical and Magnetic Fields."</p>
<p>Marie had been a teacher before coming to Paris. Now she lives in a loft apartment. According to the biography her daughter wrote for her, "Marie vowed never to love anyone again because of the disappointment and humiliation of her first love. She excluded marriage from her life's plans, building for herself a heroic and secret universe, controlled by a passion for science."</p>
<p>When Pierre first proposed to Marie, she refused, but he continued to propose to her by letter when she returned to Poland for summer vacation. The following is one of the letters he wrote to her at that time:</p>
<p>"… Any discoveries we can make, no matter how small, can always be used as valuable knowledge."</p>
<p>Text: Nothing is more pleasant than to receive news from you. The thought of not hearing from you for two more months really makes me unhappy: that is to say, I can't welcome even your little note enough.</p>
<p>I hope you are doing well now and will be back in our place in October. As for myself, I don't think I'll go anywhere; I will live in the countryside, spending my whole day in front of the open window and in the garden.</p>
<p>We have already promised each other—haven't we?—at least to become great friends. If you always refuse to change your mind! Because promises are always non-binding; these things can't be ordered at will. It may be a beautiful thing for us to live our lives closely together, and I can hardly believe it, and our lives are hypnotized by our dreams, our dreams: your patriotic dreams, our philanthropic dreams, and our scientific dreams.</p>
<p>Among these dreams, I believe the last one is the most appropriate. I think we can try to change the social order, and even when we have the power, we don't know what to do; if we want to be active, no matter what direction this activity is headed, we would never dare to say that we would not hinder some inevitable evolution, so that we would do more harm than good. On the contrary, from a scientific point of view, we can hope to do something; this piece of land must be more solid, and any discoveries we have made can always be used as valuable knowledge.</p>
<p>See how things are arranged: we have agreed to become great friends, but if you leave France within a year, it will become too Platonic a friendship, a friendship that two people will never see again. Wouldn't it be better for you and me to live together? I know this question will make you angry, and I know you don't want to mention this sentence again. Besides, from any point of view, I feel that I am completely unworthy of you.</p>
<p>I would like to ask you to promise me a chance meeting with you in Fribourg, but if I remember correctly, you only spend one day there, and of course you will spend this day with our friends, the Kovalski family.</p>
<p>Very familiar to you,</p>
<p>Pierre Curie</p>
<p>August 10, 1894</p>
<h3>Two Successes</h3>
<p>— Xiao Ying</p>
<p>"Third Uncle! Then the business strategy..."</p>
<p>"Don't ask, don't ask!" Third Uncle roared like thunder: interrupting his nephew's mumbling and whispering: "In short, based on our uncle-nephew relationship, I'm willing to give you two hundred and fifty shares, I'm choosing you to get rich! Pay it to ×× Bank before three o'clock today, five thousand! Do you understand? Before three o'clock, five thousand!"</p>
<p>"Yes! Yes! But..."</p>
<p>"No "buts," no dawdling, go quickly!"</p>
<p>So, the nephew left his third uncle's mansion to figure out a solution. Discussing a thousand with his father-in-law, a one-month limit; selling a pair of engagement rings, seven... piecing together the number of five thousand is... finding his colleague Lao Liu.</p>
<p>"Okay, Lao Zhang, I'll help you succeed, I'll risk three thousand!"</p>
<p>Nothing more to say, no way to break faith with his third uncle, the most important thing is losing the opportunity to get rich. Thus, the stock receipt in exchange for the five thousand remittance order was stored, no! placed at Lao Liu's.</p>
<p>At the founding meeting, everyone unanimously recommended Third Uncle as the chairman of the board. So, the first shot, Third Uncle transferred a property he bought last year, worth 860,000 old French francs, to the company for 1.3 million.</p>
<p>The business opened. The company's stock was immediately put up for auction on the stock market. Buying sprees hung at "twenty-six," no one sold; hung at "thirty," no one did either: hung at...</p>
<p>That's right, no one would sell. Only one million out of the five million shares were outstanding. The 50,000 shares of retail investors are all pitiful characters like those "nephews," they are ignorant, they are pleasantly surprised, stretching their necks and looking forward: rise! rise! rise! And the initiators who hung the buying signs were precisely the promoters holding 200,000 shares, that is, the directors and supervisors, where would anyone sell?</p>
<p>They deliberately release air, secretly raising the market price of "their own" stocks, so that "investors" who do not have this stock in their hands, will they not be jealous when they see the "unprecedented grand occasion?" So, they hung a buying sign: "Forty!"</p>
<p>There was an immediate response: the selling signs were hung out: "Forty-five! The auction began with a crackle and a bang, forty-two, forty-three... 100,000 shares scattered.</p>
<p>100,000 shares, that is, 4.3 to 4.4 million silver dollars went into the hands of the promoters, that is, the directors and supervisors. And they still hold 100,000 shares. They have recovered their capital (4 million), received a profit (300,000 to 400,000), still have 100,000 shares in hand, are still directors and supervisors, and can still control the life and death of the company!</p>
<p>In particular, Third Uncle has succeeded greatly, with profits on stocks and real estate.</p>
<p>We have been too neglected towards the "nephew" and his crime! So,...</p>
<p>The child Lao Zhang is always awakened by laughter in his dreams, pushing his wife and saying:</p>
<p>"Forty-four, in other words, you can still have a ring, and I can still have 1,500 or 1,600 or more than this number..."</p>
<p>"Remember? Tomorrow Dad's money, he'll give it to you because he doesn't do business himself."</p>
<p>"Tomorrow?"</p>
<p>So, tomorrow, he discussed with Lao Liu:</p>
<p>"I have to pay off debts, would you please sell these "shares" together?"</p>
<p>"It's going up! Lao Zhang, it's going to rise even more tomorrow!"</p>
<p>"Tomorrow? But..."</p>
<p>"No "buts," no dawdling, tomorrow it's guaranteed to be fifty!"</p>
<p>"Lao Liu, please help me, I need to use the money today, if it's going to rise, then lend me a thousand, I'll give you 30% interest?"</p>
<p>"Money? It's all in the stock, I'll sell it tomorrow and lend it to you!"</p>
<p>"Tomorrow..."</p>
<p>Another "successful" nephew Lao Zhang, his heart was mixed with sweetness, bitterness, and all kinds of flavors.</p>
<h3>Shared Destiny</h3>
<p>— Xiang Jia Zhi</p>
<p>One two. Backyard Flower</p>
<p>Huanglong tightened his belt, and Weicheng pulled on his belt from Huanglong's back, pulling him to shrink back the foot he had already stepped out of the door. Weicheng told him: Old Mrs. Chen is an old woman, in her twilight years, and won't live for many more years, we can't bear to kill her, this is one; if we want to avenge ourselves, we can only find the enemy's sons and daughters, we shouldn't involve the enemy's parents, this is two. Huanglong closed the door again, nodded and said: "Then you are prepared to find their sons and daughters." Weicheng looked at the roof beams and replied: "Yes." Weicheng said these words a little too slowly, Huanglong sat on the bed, suddenly changing his impetuous temper to a mild one, and said with a smile: "I heard from Sister Cuizhen that the Chen family has a son and a daughter, who have been to Shide Hall, and that daughter is called Fang, and she gets along well with you. Hmph, I'm afraid you can raise this hand to kill that son, but you can't raise that hand to kill that daughter." Weicheng's face turned red from what he said, he walked over and slapped Huanglong on the shoulder, saying: "You underestimate me too much, I... I'm not that kind of person, I'm not the kind of person who would forget righteousness for personal feelings, ha, you underestimate me too much."</p>
<p>Huanglong turned his hand back and heavily pinched Weicheng's arm, smiling: "I didn't underestimate you, I just said that. Brother Weicheng, we are still good friends." Weicheng said: "You only believe me after I said it, which shows that your previous understanding of me was not deep, Brother Huanglong, okay, okay, we have been friends for more than ten years in vain." Huanglong didn't expect that the result of saying a few words would be like this, so he had to apologize to him instead. Weicheng said: "One thing, you have to pay attention, although I have no father or mother, I still have a family, with an aunt who is as kind as my mother, I can't even take care of my aunt, run away after causing trouble, and not care about my family, so I should keep it secret. As for saying that this is a beautiful woman, this is my only lover, that is not at all on my mind, I only recognize her as my enemy's daughter, she is the enemy." Huanglong smiled: "Okay, okay, no need to say any more, tomorrow I will go to Shanghai with you." (245)</p>
