<h3>英印談判相持下　傳美將出任調解　大會黨決議案尙未公布　克里浦斯努力排除困難</h3>
<p>華盛頓二日哈瓦斯社電　華盛頓郵報今日載稱、羅斯福總統或當出而調解印度問題、印度解放一、久已爲美國人之期望、印度各界領袖實行深知、則美國出而斡旋、印度方面不致發生疑慮、就印一度方面態度觀之、苟不能事事如願、則寗可一事無成、特際此印度感受威脅之時、此種態度、似屬不足爲訓、</p>
<p>華盛頓一日哈瓦斯社電　羅斯福總統今晚接見印度駐美國民代表巴比、就印度政情及印度國民大會拒絕英國建議之可能性、有所商談、</p>
<p>里斯本二日海通社電　傅羅斯福總統方在考慮出面調停印度之問題、華盛頓政界消息靈通人士認爲、有兩項事實、指示此種動向、一則印度代表巴佩爵士昨日謁羅斯福總統、長談兩小時、但事後不肯將談話內容吿知新聞記者、二則華盛頓報章曾力陳羅斯福總統有調停印度問題之必要、聞巴佩爵士曾謂、克里浦期爵士之建議、頗有詳細研究之價値、絃外之音、殊耐人尋味也、</p>
<p>華盛頓一日路透社電　印度駐美代表巴傑、昨與美總統羅斯福會談達兩小時、辭出後、向記者談、余意克里浦斯所提建議較過去所有建議爲進步、應有愼重考慮之價値、羅總統與余談及太平洋作戰會議之職權、並未涉及英印關係、記者詢以印度各領袖是否似已決定拒絕克里浦斯之建議、巴傑答曰然、惟余仍希望此事最後可獲圓滿解決耳、</p>
<p>葡京二日同盟社電　據華盛頓來訊、英方勸印度接受克里浦斯建議之努力、似必失敗、故華盛頓方面漸有美國應調停印度問題之意見、華盛頓郵報咋刋文倡議羅斯福總統應充調停人、該報略謂、「印度之拒絕英方建議、迫使美國人民得對英之猜疑、殆無從祛除之結論、此即其他聯合各國應取行動之理由、印人之要求、似屬不可置信」、惟印度對英復陷內訌之覆轍、實乃勝利之障礙、美國若出而調停、不致招受猜疑、</p>
<p>新德里一日哈瓦斯電　克利浦斯爵士所提戰後印度改爲自治領一項計劃、業經印度國民黨及瑪哈薩巴黨予以拒絕、瑪哈薩巴黨執行委員會並發表長篇公報、縷述克里浦斯爵士提案中若干點、雖尙可接受、惟爵士前曾聲明英國提案或全部接受或予以拒絕、不容改變、現該案要點旣屬不能接受、則瑪哈薩巴黨除加以拒絕外、別無他途、</p>
<p>新德里二日路透社電　英國訪印特使克里浦斯關於印度將來憲法所提建議、印度國民黨常務委員會昨日討論四小時半、定於今晨賡續討論、據該黨主席阿柴特官稱、定於今日午後四時三十分會見克里浦斯、惟聞阿柴特今日會見克里浦斯時、或當吿以該黨常會之決議、聲明反對英方建議之理由、此項決議內容、今晚當可公布、此外、印度敎會常務委員會業已發表長篇聲明書、內容略稱、克里浦斯所發宣言、數點尙可差强人意、惟謂英國建議、須完全加以接受、或完全加以拒絕、則屬不幸、英方建議若干要旨旣難全部或局部加以接受、印度敎會勢惟有加以拒絕之一途、至於印度敎會碍難苟同者、在政治上分裂印度、其一也、過渡期內如何處理、英方建議語焉不詳、其二也、國防問題、共三也、至於國民黨在中央議會所發表之聲明則謂、英方建議、在多方面均不足以適應時局之需要、對於印度之前途、更多危險性、爲印度國民黨計、惟有加以拒絕而已、</p>
<p>新德里二日路透社電　克利浦期定今夜接見藩邦王公會議之代表、</p>
<p>新德里二日路透社電　印度國民大會常務委員會之決議案、未必立即發表、預料克利浦斯一俟接到國民大會之拒絕書後、將以數日時間、再度努力　除各項困難、克氏接到國民大會之決議時、倘暗示英方歡迎　民大會提出對案、則國民大會當有向英提出對案可能、</p>
<p>新德里二日哈瓦斯社電　英國訪印特使克里浦斯爵士頃官稱、原擬於本月六日啟程返國、茲已決定展緩歸期、本人與印度各界代表談判所遇困難、巳日漸减少、相信下星期內可望有所成就、</p>
<p>美國斡旋當有成就</p>
<p>華盛頓二日路透社電　華盛頓郵報今日社評、謂美總統羅斯福或擬試探斡旋印度問題之可能性並謂美國對於印度之願望、咸表同情、羅總統倘作斡旋之議、印度必不懷疑及美國之好意、蓋印度之解放問題、美國夙所關懷、印人亦知之甚切也、至於中國方面亦必支持總統之努力、此更爲重要、蓋中國對英提具體之勸吿、英國之建議、是以同盟國家中急應有所表示、印度內部倘若不能協調、則戰爭前途、必受牽掣、無論如何、華府方面確持此觀點、關於國防問題、英方對印之讓步、規定印度可派代表參加英國戰時內閣、澳大利亞之加賽、即屬一例、如此則印度即可對於作戰問題、發表意見、印人對此尙無明白之認識耳、印度敎之觀點、爲英方須接受其全部之意見、任何妥協辦法、礙難接受、實則處現在情形之下、此種態度、實屬不智、</p>
<p>大會黨之拒絕決議</p>
<p>新德里二日路透社電　聞大會黨對於英國戰爭內閣計劃、加以拒絕之決議案所　議者、一爲關於防務之部份、二爲予各行省以不參加將來印度聯邦之自由、三爲印度各邦派代表參與製訂憲法國體之方法、</p>
<p>新德里二日路透社電　大會黨常務委員拒絕英閣建議之決議案全文、一時不致公布、預料克里浦斯接悉大會黨反對決議案之確切措詞後、將於今後數天繼續努力、以完成排除困難之工作、大約克氏接得決議案、若有歡迎反提建議之表示、則大會黨將擬具此種反提建議、於相當時間內遞交克氏、</p>
<p>建議組織英印聯軍</p>
<p>華盛頓一日哈瓦斯社電　參議院外交委員會主席康那萊昨夜提出一項建議、主張英國立即組織一英印聯軍總司令部、緣渠認爲在現行環境之下、保衛印度、實爲當務之亟、設立英印聯軍總司令部之後、可使印度反對英國方案之情緒、消滅於無形、美國政府對於英印談判、雖極悲觀、但相信英國對於若干點、必能讓步、同時並希望印度領袖亦能作相當讓步、要之、余仍望克里浦斯特使此行、能商得妥恊、</p>
<p>印人要求移交政權</p>
<p>新德里一日合衆社電　據消息靈通者盛傅、克里浦斯現已向英內閣發出「緊急求救呼號」、說明各政黨之反響、克里浦斯於其中表明印度各界一致耍求由印度人自行担任國防委員、苟此點英方能予同意、則或可使各界拒絕英建議之態度轉變、國家主義黨領袖薩泊魯及査耶加發表聲明、督促英方指派印度人爲國防委員一舉、或爲上項傳說之來源、目前之事實即英國苟不同意對建議加以修改、則全印國民大會絕無接受建議之可能、其他政黨如回敎同盟等、均認爲國民大會苟拒絕建議、則彼等即無須考慮該建議、印度各藩邦王公因對於建議中有關彼等之各點未有作淸楚之闡明、故反響亦屬不佳、據悉甘地及尼赫魯均未從事起草國民大會之聲明、此項工作現交由馬德拉斯省前任總理之巴拉査里辦理、査氏爲國民大會常務委員會中溫和派親英之委員、此點可表示國民大會之聲明中、將作翔實之論理與具體之對案、</p>
<p>新德里一日路透社電　印度敎大乘會負責人稱、大乘會今苟贊同任何足使印度發生任何形式或方式之政治分裂之建議、則將違反其本旨、且危害危度印度益、任何省分有不參加聯邦之權限、爲自決之原則所不許、且此種權限絕不容山外界之當局制定云、印度現已爲統一之國家、現存之各省均措成行政上之單位、今者主權國家參加聯邦之情形、或主權國家爲其共同之目的而犧牲其主權之一部之情形、均不能適用於印度之各省、大乘會對於宣言中所舉之未來之一切關切之情緒、以英國是否立即願將政權移交印度一點爲大乘會之要求、印度應立即宣布爲獨立國家、在不列顚聯合國之下、享受自由平等之地位、宣言中保證未來畀印以完全之國家權、但在過渡時期內印度之憲法地位則未闡明、吾人國防計劃、尤屬不能接受云、</p>
<p>自由黨正謀取妥協</p>
<p>新德里二日路透社電　大會黨某常委今日與新聞記者閒談時、對英方建議有所背議、惟據渠覜察現行會談、頗似一九三一年之談判、當時甘地與伊爾溫勳爵（即今之哈里法克斯勳爵）進行談判、經最初七天之狐疑與失望後、卒能簽訂條約、據現象察之、若干人士、如自由黨領袖薩普魯與茄雅卡等刻正竭共所能、謀取妥協、同時、回教公會常委員仍未揭露其意嚮、昨曾與克里浦斯同進餐之回敎公會會長琴那現保持完全緘默、一般感覺以爲談判之將來發展、將視克氏對大會黨文吿之反響及克氏與英國準備作何種讓步、以迎合大會黨之觀點而定、</p>
<p>英國予以解釋</p>
<p>倫敦二日路透社電　倫敦泰晤士報今日以（最後關頭）爲題、評論印方評論英國建議事、據稱、克利浦斯特使此次赴印、携有兩項建議、其一極爲明確、內容係關於戰後之印度地位者、其次係關於戰時過渡期間下辦法、其內容自不免稍有含糊者、印度國民大會表示拒絕之主要點、倘爲第二項建議、則吾人顯知彼等對於建議之核心、仍可加以接受、印方要求印度防禦權應立即移交印人、實則此事有一加解釋之必要、在此多事之秋、華維爾將軍出任印度軍總司令、殊有事實上之利益、而美國之將領、今日亦有爲澳洲區之統帥者、其司令部並設於澳境、華維爾將軍昔日統帥ABD防區時、數國之軍隊、俱歸其指揮、但華氏本人則須向華府提出報吿、由此而論、華氏在印之地位、並非含有蔑視印度之意、印方倘同意華氏保持現職、以繼續向作戰會議負、印方亦可派代表出席該會議、按任命印人出任英國政府中地位如陸軍部大臣之職位問題、亦有商談之餘地、總之、華維爾將軍執行全盤戰略之任務、殊爲明顯、而不應加以干涉、今日之責任、在於國民大會及其他印人代言機關、彼等應明白表示其對於英方建議之判斷、</p>
<h3>八打雁有步哨戰　日軍砲轟美陣地　柯列基陀島亦遭襲擊</h3>
<p>華盛頓二日路透社電　據陸軍部宣布、菲列賓八打雁半島方面僅有步哨戰、日本軍艦亦砲轟該半島西岸美軍陣地、美軍陣綫並被日軍俯衝式機轟炸、馬尼刺灣柯列基陀島要塞則時被日機襲擊、至午後、加維蒂海岸日軍砲隊亦開砲向之轟擊、先是、日本步兵隊曾於上月三十一日晚八時左右猛攻美軍前哨陣地、經過猛烈之白刃戰後、美軍前哨陣地數處被奪、</p>
<p>華盛頓一日路透社電　陸軍部根據今晨九時前所獲情報發表公報如下、菲律賓方面日步兵於三十一晚八時向我軍防綫作正面進玫、日軍在迫擊砲火掩護下數度攻擊我軍外圍、雙方肉據數小時、昨日日機以兩架爲一批、不斷轟炸柯里幾多要塞、</p>
<p>東京二日同盟社電　日大本營本日下午三時二十分發表、日海軍航空部隊自三月二十四至三十一日爲止、連日轟炸可蘭赫特可、覆滅該島美菲軍髙射砲陣地、並徹底破壞機塲兵營及官所等、</p>

<p>本報特稿</p>
<h3>佛國的緬甸（上）</h3>
<p>緬甸爲我國西南之鄰邦，其土地與我國國界，若犬牙之交錯，其民族與我國具同種之親密。緬國的特徵除參天之椰，　樹和芒果外，便是星散全緬金碧輝煌的塔，其次就是光頭黃衣的和尙了。俗稱緬甸三多：「一僧，二塔，三烏鴉。」原來緬人崇尙佛敎，加以緬甸是農業經濟社會，天然農產品豐收，使他們有恒力追尋精神生活。</p>
<p>緬人有健美的體魄，活潑的表情，溫和的心地，樂善好施，不事積蓄，一旦剩下錢財，便資助佛寺，幼年時候，精神就受佛敎的薰陶，「信人生如渡苦海」所以盡情享樂，快樂終身。‘</p>
<p>緬人慣常禮拜佛塔，或到寺院聽法師講道，或靜坐在一處讀經，有錢人蓋寺築塔，窮人在路旁裝置水缸，修理橋樑，以便行旅，籍以造福來生。緬人信仰佛敎，（自古被選爲國敎）佛敎三寳：釋迦，佛法和僧侶，供奉最虔。襁褓時代的孩子即由母親在唱催眠歌時，不知不覺中灌輸了宗敎敎育，緬女人尤爲虔誠，她們在淸晨拜佛禱吿，然後佈施僧侶，晚上還得在佛前獻花禱告。這些簡直是緬女人認爲天經地義應盡的實任。</p>
<p>非但緬平民如此信佛，再看看緬王明當吧，他在位廿年內總算寗靜，他是有史以來賢明的國君，平日沉默寡言，若一說話，便是善言——一些敎人信佛修善的話。</p>
<p>遍布全境的塔</p>
<p>據瑞納氏所著的緬人的人生觀裏面說：「沒有什麼功德的報酬，比造塔更厚的」，因此緬國中無論貴賤，莫不以建塔築寺爲樂，或動公帑，揮金巨萬，或節食縮衣，集腋成裘，務使達到他們的目的，由是緬甸的塔遍佈全境了。遊人們溯伊洛瓦底江而上，就可以看到那夾岸山巔散若星辰，形似圓錐的塔在爭妍鬥艷，牠那燦爛調和的色彩，那恬靜溫柔中而雅緻的姿態，配着叮叮噹嘴和諧的鐘聲，怎不令人萬念皆空欣羨不已！據說有人大略統計過，那星散在全緬的塔，若把牠排成一縱隊，那麽可以從仰光附近的綠利安起，一直超過極北的密支那，換言之，塔的行列，可以由北到南貫穿緬甸全境而有餘，其數目之多，可以想見。</p>
<p>緬人稱塔爲「色底」（Zedi）可分四種。「建都」色底建在佛骨或其模型之上；「巴里保加」色底建在八樣神器或其模型之上；「奧載他」色底中置佛像；「　　」（即佛所晚法）色底中放佛經。</p>
<p>塔的位置，多依山傍水，並且週圍還有靑葱的芒果，高髙的棕樹，葉大無比的芭蕉，處在這樣的環境中，每當朝陽初升，或晚照斜射的常兒，抑或月明之夜，選金光閃鑠的建築物，在綠林情抱中放出微笑似的回光，美麗的倒影，沒在如鏡的水面，還點綴着紅的蓮苞，綠的荷葉，微風送來塔頂柔和的鍾聲，夾雜着寺裏僧徒抑揚的吟誦經典聲，此情此境，怎不令人意遠！</p>
<p>塔爲一實心之建築物，不能攀其巔作鳥瞰，祇可於塔脚瞻仰。築塔的材料用磚塊，灰石，外塗金粉或石灰。塔形多似鐘，如仰光之大金塔，他的精緻嫻雅，是足够令人玩味的。塔頂還有五七層的小銅塔，似一把銅傘，上鏤花草，吊着小鈴和銅钹，微風吹動，發出叮叮噹噹的响声，小銅塔之頂端爲金鋼鑽蕊，窮苦的地方以玻璃瓶替代，這有兩個意義：一是像蓮蕊狀，因爲佛典所載，釋迦在其母摩耶體內時形似蓮蕊。一是可以避電。更有一件重要事情，無論何塔，總要塊藏多少聖物，否則塔尖是不能張蓋的。　着塔的平台有個祈禱者的禮拜堂，裏面有許多大佛　，　內有一尊或幾尊佛像，就在　前有成羣結隊的緬人作虔誠禱吿。塔旁的寺裏，有一種體積龐大的鐘，懸在寺的一角，一根橫柱頭的當中，離地尺許，撞鍾的時間在祈禱的前後，以角敲擊，　的一聲，說是可以　請天上地下　神，　照他們誠心禱吿　　　　近必有放生池，施放魚蝦龜　等水族之類</p>
<p>塔旁有和尙寺附在旁邊，裝璜不亞於其他廟宇，也有個式義摩那尼庵，則較和尙　爲遜色。</p>
<p>香客寺往往也接連和尙寺，專供遠道而來的香客休歇，裏面任何人均可住宿，緬人素無旅店的開設，類多前往過夜，窮苦路人，更視爲良好的塲所。</p>
<p>緬甸有兩個聞名的塔：一爲束西聞名的仰光大金塔，一爲全緬最奇特的吉鐵窰塔。</p>
<p>大金塔不但名聞全緬，而且是印度支那半島最神聖美麗的佛寺。這塔建於十六世紀，塔高三百六十八英尺，較暹維的晨光塔，高一百一十八英尺，較紐約的自由神像，高六十八英尺，較埃及的最髙金字塔，低一百二十英尺。此塔初僅高二十七尺，後經七次增修，才成今日的壯觀。塔爲實心，外貼金粉，頂端揷風向標，下承金傘一把，重一噸餘，係緬王明當所獻，其上下四斤懸鈴一萬五千枚，其中一百餘枚是金質，餘皆銀質。風向標與鑽石蓮蕊中，嵌有紅寶石三千六百六十四顆，翡翠五百十一枚，金鋼鑽四百三十三粒，實不愧爲塔中之王了。</p>
<p>吉　　奇塔，築在離吉桃（仰光塔車去吉桃，相距約一百零五里）十里的山嶺，山路崎嶇曲折，有幾處斜壁峭立，無路可通，設有木梯登援，險峻異常。奇塔就建在山頂一個大　石上，石的週圍約五六百尺，重可數十萬斤，其下成銳角形，放落於一髙大石磐上，要到圓石下面的人須過一木橋。遊客若推圓石，則左右搖動，但塔則穩立如故。這奇怪的古代建築，應用巧妙的力學，是値得欽佩的。</p>

<h3>猶人與游資</h3>
<p>— 甘</p>
<p>自從歐洲大陸猶太人被驅逐出境而後，上海竟成爲猶人的　閭，擁有資產的固然帶了資本早早駕臨這東方樂土，就是有名一文的也由難民船陸續送到本市。現在你從法租界走到虹口，到處可以碰見猶人。這種猶人的本領郤實在大，不僅能够在上海活命，並且影響本市的市塲呢。</p>
<p>原來「猶太人」這個名稱，彷彿就是「死要錢」的代名詞。他們沒有國家，他們不知道民族，他們所唯一追求的就是利益，就是大洋鈿。猶人追求利益的本領，可說舉世無匹。第一按排調度資本的方法是最最巧妙，在歐洲市塲練，就的一副本領帶到上海來運用，當然駕輕就熟，穩操左券。他們固然沒有國家民族的觀念，可是爲了利益卻最會結幫，例如一個人囤積某種商品，其影響到底不大，猶人郤會得結幫囤貨，並且應用種種方法務使影響市塲，結果某種貨物果然暴騰，日夜漲價，漲到無可再漲時他們便出籠，爛汚拆在別人身上，猶人是發財了，這是指帶了資本到上海來，做股票以及投機賣買的猶人。至於不名一文的猶人，居然也帶了一副隨身本領，有的會修鍾表，有的會配製藥方，有的會圖畫音樂，有的會油漆粉飾，有的會做化妝品，做大菜加非，於是從手挾一破皮包，到處亂闖出售小件雜貨之類做起，一步步髙昇，居然獲得半間店面，逐漸擴充而佔據一個大門面，更進而雇用中國夥計，而他們自已也已學會一套必需的上海話了。這一般的無產的猶人在上海也就成家立業了。猶太人眞正不愧爲猶太人。中國商人儘管本領大，總不是猶人的敵手。</p>
<p>猶人在上海所經營的買賣，已够影響市面，使消費者受累的了，比猶人更兇，更難對付，更不顧消費者的生死的，那便是擠在上海的一大筆游資。</p>
<p>擠在上海的游資在太平洋戰爭沒有爆發之前，是做外匯，股票，囤貨，地產之類，戰爭爆發後是做軍票，囤貨，因爲游資太多，甚至當局想盡方法要控制也控制不住，而日常用品則依外匯軍票的昇騰而跟着閃電上漲，幾分錢一張的複寫紙會漲到幾塊錢一張，就是內行做夢也做不到。原因擠來擠去的游資，見洞就鑽，無孔不入，商品價格的上落，完全是漫無標準的了。百　機式的油膏，原來是可有可無的東西，因爲平時廣吿做得多，牌子做老了，居然人人看中，要把它囤積起來，這種似有用而實無用的油膏，從一盒幾毛錢漲到三五倍而至十餘倍以至二十倍……人人還在看漲。又如痧藥水蚊蟲香之類還沒有當令，已經有人在大量搜購了。</p>
<p>囤積居奇，購買期貨鈔票等等的人，對於日常用品的飛漲是全不擺在心上的。因爲他他發了橫財，以爲米價即至一石六百元，也出在別人身上的，條管貴好了，滿不在乎。至於一般正當良民規規矩矩的生活，便大受其累，從略有節蓄而成爲負伏人，從中產而變成赤貧，從無產而變成乞丐，從乞丐而變成路倒屍，擁有游資的發橫財者「死人不關」，他還是向有孔的地方鑽，橫財發了還想發！</p>
<p>在猶人與游資雙重壓迫之下，哀哀小民，自然只有坐以待斃的一條路了。</p>

<p>溯自聖依納爵於一五四〇年創立耶穌會後，不久，耶穌會徧傅全球。明末，利瑪寳於一五八三年亦來吾國傅敎。一七七三年，敎皇格來孟十四世，被仇恨聖教者所迫，下令取消耶穌會；而在中國之耶穌會，亦於一七七五年十一月十五日，奉羅馬命解散。</p>
<p>然物極則反，理之常也，敎皇庇護七世於一八一四年，頒布論旨，恢復耶穌會；歐洲各國耶穌會於是重新復興。吾中國國籍司鐸及敎友得知此訊，遂亦上書羅馬敎皇額我略十六世，及耶穌會總長勞達司鐸，請求遣派會士，重來中國，敎皇與總長允之，乃遣法國三會士南格祿Gotteland，艾方濟Esteve，李秀芳Brueyre，於一八四一年四月二十日，起程來華，翌年七月十一日抵上海。</p>
<p>徐家匯之名稱由來</p>
<p>三會士旣扺上海，乃復興傅敎事業；一八四七年在徐家　購地築聚堂及住院，而徐家滙自後遂成為耶穌會傅敎之中心點。徐家滙者為明相國徐文定公墳墓之所在地，公之子孫世居其地，又為肇家浜與法華涇兩水滙集處，因名曰徐家滙。會士旣擇徐家滙，為其集中之地，各種文化事業，亦在是地次第創辦；徐家滙之藏書樓即於一八四七年開始經營，蒐集書籍；徐滙中學，原名聖依納爵公學，於一八五〇年創立；土山灣孤兒院於　八六四年舉辦·一八七三年，天文台設立；一八七九年，出版益聞報，一八八七年又出聖心報，一切文化工作，逐漸興辦。今祇言　著專業。</p>
<p>一百年來耶穌會中握筆著書者，大抵為國籍會士，西洋會士無華文著作。國籍會士之著作家以江蘇為多，其次為河北獻縣，又次為安微，為廣東，以新耶穌會集中於江蘇省故也。其所編著之書籍，大抵以宗敎為多，分類言之，有聖經，辯護，神哲學，道理，崇修，敬禮，敎理，敎史，科學等書；論其量有數百種，多於老耶穌會之出版，論其質似亦不亞於老耶穌會，惟其影響未能追美前人；蓋為時勢使然也。新會士於一八四二年抵上海至本年，一九四二年，一世紀中，關於編著之書，可分三時期以言之。</p>
<p>編著書籍分三時期</p>
<p>第一時期自一八四二年至一八七九年，可謂創辦時期；此時期中，其第一本出版之小册，是「聖會總問答』，署名泰西耶穌會士南有岳德郎氏譯述，川沙莊行儉參訂；第二本為「大赦例解」。極西耶穌會士晁德蒞Zottli著。晁公意人。當時為徐　聖依納爵公學校長，後為耶穌會初學神師，不特桃李盈門，且多擅長文學之門弟子，若馬良相伯，李林問漁等是。此時期中出版之書僅十多種。</p>
<p>第二時期自一八七九年，益聞錄開辦之年起，至一九一一年滙報停辦之日為止。此時期可稱為興盛時期；蓋在此時期中不特出版興盛。且文化事業正式有組織，創立漢學研究社Varietes　Sinologiques；主其事者為夏鳴雷Havret，而協助之者有國籍會士李林（問漁）沈則寬，　柴，蔣升，徐　，徐尤希，張漁珊等，海門黃伯祿司鐸亦為著名之漢學家，聞名歐美。漢學叢書出版至今已有六十六種。</p>
<p>除漢學叢書外，徐　又組織一文化機關，即　聞錄之發行，初定每月出版二次，其第一號發刊於一八七九年三月十六日，至十一號起，每七日出報一次；當時除上海申報外，報紙寥寥如農星，益聞錄一出‘不脛而行，風行全國。一八八七年，又出版聖心報，每月一次。此二報均係李問漁（林）司鐸所創辦。益聞錄後改名滙報，每七日出二次；至一九一一年停刊，改組為聖敎雜誌，聖心報出版至今，從未間斷。</p>
<p>此第二時期中之出版物，僅前期二十年中，約出一百種書籍，大半係聖書；戊戍政變後，淸廷崇尙西學，於是會士又編譯科畢，出版許多書籍，頗為社會所歡迎。李問漁司鐸以一人而言，計三十三年中，著有六十多種。李公實為此時期中之代表人物。公江蘇南滙人，生於一八四〇年，卒於一九一一年，李公故世後而徐匯刊物於是又入一新時期矣。</p>
<p>第三時期，即聖敎雜誌創辦之年起，至現在為止。雜誌第一期於一九一二年一月出版，每月一次，創辦及主編人係會士潘秋麓司鐸，潘公江蘇靑浦人，生於一八六七年，卒於一九二一年；副編者張漁珊司鐸，張公江蘇南滙人，生於一八七二年，卒於一九二九年，亦為有名之漢學家，著有不少書籍。聖敎雜誌之內容，大抵為辯護道理，研究學術，對於現代思想，尤為注意，故一經出版，不特風行於敎內讀者，且普及於　外學界，而歐美華僑亦多有訂閱者，一九三八年九月，以環境關係暫行停刊·</p>
<p>此第三時期之前期，關於出版物，有敎科書之編輯，自小學以至中學均有課本，有文言者，有國語者，由土山灣印書館發行。一九二七年，國民政府定都南京後，思想潮流又大變，一般人士注重民治民權，而社會主義，共產主義又大事宜傅。此時會士之出版物有公民，三民主義，社會學，經濟學等等書籍。同時神學哲學等書亦多有刊印。叉有各種小叢書之出版，頗合時代潮流。</p>
<p>一九二七年八月，徐　組織一編譯所，即光啟社，上海徐光啟以文化宣揚公敎，故該社取以為名，用資紀念。光啟社之宗旨在編譯關於宗敎及學問之書籍，以溝通中西文化，較漢學研究所之範圍尤廣，已有多種書籍出版。又耶穌會士在吾國傅敎者，散居各省，國籍不同，所隸省會又異；最近為聯絡全國耶穌會華文出版事業起見，於一九四〇年，在徐匯設有全國耶穌會華文刊物聯詢處，俾能彼此報吿，互通音訊。</p>
<p>百年成績斐然可觀</p>
<p>至論各種書籍之內容，皆言之有物，於道德學問至有裨益。論其文體，有精深華麗者，有淺顯淸順者，要之對於閱者階級之不同，乃有文俗之殊異；又新耶穌會士之著述，非若老耶穌會士，借助於翰曹之潤色，或名人之作序跋也。坐此之故，新會士之著作，無達官文人為之　揚，又少傅祗流於　外人中，有奉敎之人日常誦閱，以為修成一己之法。但其中自有不可磨滅之妙道，一經揭示，則　相欣賞之矣。例如周作人先生論遵主聖範云：『這部遵主聖範，是我所喜歡的一種書，雖然我不是天主敎徒。我聽說這是中世紀基督敎思想的一部代表的著作，却沒有道學家的那種嚴厲氣，而且牠的宗旨，又近於神秘主義，使我們覺得很有趣味。從文字方面講，牠也是很有價値的書。」周作人著自己的園地頁二〇〇</p>
<p>此一世紀中，耶穌會所出或重印之書籍，在質與量兩方面言之，有不少重要之書如新史合編直講，新經全集，新經譯義，道源精萃，默想全書，修成正鵠，崇修引，神學提綱，哲學提綱，超性學要，名理探，徐氏庖言等等書。</p>
<p>準此而論，新耶穌會士在此百年中所有出版物，已斐然可觀，尙有許多西文書，華法字典，詞典，地圖，小說，尙未一一言之。今按土山灣印書館書目單（一九四一年）列有九七一種之書籍，天津崇德堂（一九四〇年）書目單有八一六種；安慶，蕪湖，蚌埠，　慶，徐州，澳門，出版物，尚未列入其中。惟上言之一七八七種書中，有單張，小册，及老耶穌會士著作之重印本，亦計在其內。</p>
<p>綜上所言，不過舉共崖略，聊作紀念，此後文化事業，必更有可觀焉。</p>

<h3>胡椒上落至鉅</h3>
<p>黑胡椒因來源已斷、又爲囤戶目標之一、蓋此物久儲可以不壞、故皮球交易極爲興隆、號盤一號椒曾達一千五百元之最髙峯、旋轉見鬆、復低至一千二百元、連日又見回緊、昨爲一千三百五十元、</p>
<h3>米仁軋缺</h3>
<p>米仁久無到貨、市存亦已極薄、惟査囤戶方面尙有少數備積、因見貨底軋缺、頗具奢望、如關米仁叫升百餘元、而普通貨亦升數十元、後市髙貨或將達五六百元云、</p>
<h3>波羅蜜（續）</h3>
<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>况說它自己的繁殖力又非常可驚：無論是從地下根中發生出來的「根蘖」抑係從地上莖的葉腋旁邊發生出來的「牙蘖」，也無論是果實下邊側生的「小株」抑係果實上面叢生的「葉冠」，全可以和母株割開作爲蕃殖之用；至於果質所結的「種子」，也一樣可以發牙，生育，以至結實，不過比較需時稍多就是了。所以現在出產波羅蜜的地方，美洲各熱帶國家不必說了；亞洲則有印度，印度支那半島，和南洋羣島；非洲則有幾內亞和剛果河流域；至於太平洋上的諸島，特別是熱帶植物福地的夏威夷，還有大西洋上的亞速爾羣島與馬得拉羣島等，在在均可以見到它的蹤跡；甚至連溫帶各國的養花房中也一樣能够培植它。</p>
<p>波羅蜜照例每株只生一枚，然其產量和果實的大小，則因爲種類的不同而有差異。况說它的本來面目，也只是如同橘子的大小而已：它所以能有現在這麼肥大的，完全是人改良它的種子的結果。按種類分：則美國東南的佛洛利達省多栽培「西班牙種」，其結實比例爲百分之九十三，而果徑有百分之六七十可以超過五吋。這種波羅蜜長度較徑度微短，形成扁平的樣子，成熟時作艷紅色，易於保藏，便於遠輸，在商業上最有價値。在中美洲，古巴島，圭亞那，或夏威夷羣島等地方，則人喜歡栽培，「加耶納（Cayenne）」種。這種果實品質較優，色黃綠而微帶紅，結實比例爲百分之五六十，至於果子則百分之九十五其直徑可以超過五吋。在西印度羣島中的英屬牙買加島同美屬波爾多利哥島，在巴西，在南非洲，在亞洲南部，和東印度羣島等地方，則除了上述二種以外，又有一種「王后種」：它的結實比例能髙到百分之九十八，或竟至百分之百！以上所說各種波羅蜜，全是四季可以分秧，四季可以開花，四季可以結實：栽培家可以預計什麽時候拿它應市最爲合算而屆時採摘它。再補充一句的是：每一顆波羅蜜普通是十五磅重，也有的能重到二十五磅的。</p>
<p>波羅蜜摘下後，必需讓它「出汗」——蒸發潮氣——二十四小時，然後一枚一枚的用紙包裹好，裝箱啟運；每箱約盛八枚或稍多，當中襯以玉蜀黍楷草以免震動。要是製造罐頭呢，則有特製的機器，把它鑤皮鑽核，分割……等那一步一步的手續，我想不要緊去叙述它了。至於製造罐頭的兩個大本營，則是夏威夷和新嘉坡，這東西遙遙相望的兩個海軍重鎭……！（完）</p>

<h3>與二房東談利潤</h3>
<p>— 維城</p>
<p>過去（也祇是這三五年間），二房東與三房客之間的術突爭執，可以說是盡花樣之能事了；然一言以蔽之，二房東是奇貨可居，三房客是不勝負擔；在這　與三之間，就像有着非常遠的距離似的，永遠是站在敵對地位，背道而馳。現在呢，這距離在表面上似乎沒有變動，按諸實際，却有一種無形的力在把雙方面拉攏，如果大家平心靜氣地想一想，就覺得這二與三僅是單位的差別，而不是階級的差別。</p>
<p>二房東有個別號叫「吃房子」，我們做三房客的自然懂得。不過，從前是大家願意擠到上海來，自然願意被「吃」，即使感到被「吃」得寃枉而來衝突爭執一下，結果也是被迫着低下頭來。現在做三房客的，大概都是些抱着「鷄肋」的朋友，已經到了食之無味的時候，也即將是領免費還鄕證隊伍中的第一候補員了。無論什麼天大的事情，到了頂點，就是大也大不了。所以，現在的二房東與三房客之間還有什麽衝突爭執的話，也該是最後一次了。——這最後一次，三房客如果是失敗的，勝利的也不是二房東；但決不是勝負不分，眼見的事實是「房子空了」！這就是「無形的力」，這力量能把背道而馳的雙方拉攏，因之，想與二房東談談利潤問題。</p>
<p>公共租界已經規定二房東的利潤不得超過百分之二十，連「外揷花」在內也最多不得超過百分之三十五，而以三月三十一日以前的契約爲準，避免新舊法幣的「節外生枝」。此項規定施行之日，亦即天下太平之時，本文所提的二房東當然指是「浜南」的了。</p>
<p>以我所住在的二房東而言，他的利潤約在百分之二百五十至三百之間，他們自己的住屋不計在內。與百分之三十五比較起來，誠使公共租界的二房東有「翹首南望」之感。但在昨天早上（四月一日），二房東的新命令下來了，要付新幣，其理由是房捐，水常費都要新幣，所以房租也要收新幣。這理由與從前大房東加租水電加價一樣，叫做「有加必賺」。而且人同此心，法租界的三房客已大半接到此項暗加房租三成的通吿了。這種新通吿自然不免有一番爭執，這爭執，我想不會發生從前一樣的結果吧？這不同的結果，也爲了有「無形的力」在內——不過不是拉攏，而是拉得更遠；然而勝負是分明的。</p>
<p>最近幾個月來，無論治安，食糧等問題，兩當局都是取同一步驟的，「浜南」的二房東們不要以爲「唯我獨尊」，這「無形的力」在好的方面是拉攏；在另一方面，它的力量是超過反抗的。</p>
<h3>結婚難</h3>
<p>— 莎伯</p>
<p>法國大小說家莫泊桑說，結婚好像買彩票，號碼能開出來的使是好的了。</p>
<p>幾萬號的彩票中，能打中的號碼究竟太少了，可見得結婚實然不是一件容易的事情。即使把結婚的論理撇開着不談，而專門來講實際問題——經濟上的困難，像在今日的生活程度之下，恐怕也够叫一班靑年人麻煩了。</p>
<p>前在西報中見有一結婚費超過八千元」文（指西人言），在這風和日暖，懶洋洋的天氣裏，來胡凑一篇數目字的短文，也許可稱之爲應時」文章罷。</p>
<p>那裏面說，結婚的第一步，女的方面少不得先要一只訂婚戒子，當然鑚戒愈大愈好，總算愛人體諒，一千五百元一只小鑚戒，再便宜也沒有了。</p>
<p>兩口子一經訂婚，少不來常常要吃茶，看電影，跳舞，上館子，總括一句話，又是化錢的勾當。</p>
<p>新娘娘在結婚之日所穿的禮服，目下做一套至少五百元，五年前一百元已足。</p>
<p>結婚之日愈近，新郞的頭也愈痛，金的結婚戒子至少要二百五十元至三百元。他所穿的結婚禮服，租用一次價須四十五元。五年前租費只要十元，做一套新的也不過百元左右。現在却非五百元至一千元不辦。借禮拜堂結婚，牧師先生的費用又是一百元、鮮花，唱詩，琴手等費用在外。　雖說是小家庭，第一個月的房租，先付後住，五百元是少不來一個銅子的、房子裏不能叫它儘是空着。動用的傢具勢在必買。新娘娘所中意的是一套麻栗臥室木器，價三千元，套飯間用具大約八百元，還有一套三件頭的沙發之類二千元。總數五千八百元，又不翼而飛。</p>
<p>刀叉湯匙盆碟之類，總算叨諸親好友之光，源源惠賜，未費分文。可是地毯窗簾，茶具，檯布，掛燈，和無綫電收音機等，不能不自掏腰包。還有廚房傭人等的工資，不能不預付一月。</p>
<p>好了，前前後後加起來，總數已超過八千元大關。還是獨身的好！</p>
<h3>先捉臭蟲卵</h3>
<p>— 新綠</p>
<p>昨晚上，大約因為天氣稍爲暖和，蟄伏着的臭蟲，四出活動了，把我從好夢中咬醒，失眠了一夜。氣憤極了，便立志要去除它。</p>
<p>早晨天還朦朦亮，就披衣下床，燒了一壺開水，把床板拆下來，拿到晒臺上去，澆了一周，在板縫中發現許多白色透明橢圓形的臭蟲卵。</p>
<p>因想到如果這些卵子全孵化後，將滋生蔓延，而不容易淸除了，幸虧發覺尙早呢。</p>
<p>記得有人曾請問吳稚喗老先生，芟除臭蟲，有何妙法。先生不直接回答，但給那人一信，命他回家後拆看。原來全張信箋上，祇有「勤捉」二個大字，並無什麼秘方。</p>
<p>勤捉，果然是芟除臭蟲唯一有效的方法，但不易肅淸，不若在牠還未出世，先行置之於死地，旣輕而易舉，並更可一次殲滅，不致再在悶熱的夏夜，受到牠的騷擾了。</p>
<p>臭蟲，一名懶蟲，此名的意義，要請大家自己去體味了。</p>
<h3>「生兒不如生猪好」</h3>
<p>— 公雞</p>
<p>在一個偶然的機會，看見人行道旁坐着一個中年男子，和一個小孩。小孩的舊式的毡帽上，揷着一根稻草的草標。「草標」的意義是表示出賣，被出賣的當然不楚那舊式的毡帽，而是那戴毡帽的小孩。我不想買一個小孩，我更不敢動問這小孩要賣多少錢，因爲我實在不忍把一個「萬物之靈」的「人」，像一只牲口一樣地去問牠價格。我默默地站在一旁，我希望有一個能忍人所不能忍的「非常人」上去問問價格，或者竟買了這小孩。我可以旁聽裏得知「萬物之靈」的「人」，「市價」究値若干。</p>
<p>一對靑年情侶，手臂勾着手臂走過去，脚步是這樣地急促，而且眼看眼口對口地談個不休，他們根本沒有注意道旁有「萬物之靈」出賣。一位禿頂洋裝的中年紳士，口銜着呂宋烟舞着手杖走過，他以輕視不屑的眼光向那揷「草標」的腦袋一瞥，隨手拔出烟屁股向路旁一甩；這種廢物，同烟屁股一樣地廢物。一位面目慈祥的吃素老太太，手拿佛珠，嘴裏或者正在念某一段金剛經，她吃驚地向「草標」一注視，連忙加緊脚步，口誦眞經走過；這就是前世作孽，今生果報，老太太大澈大悟，回家去佛前多進供奉。兩個散學回家的幼童，瞪着眼睛奇怪地看那「草標」，他們不明白「草標」的意義。站住了一會，慢慢地倒退幾步，又接一連二的飛奔離開，一面跑，一面大笑，也許他們以爲帽子上挿「草標」，是一件可笑的事。</p>
<p>據說一只肥猪，可以換上千的法幣。一個香烟屁股，可以引起兩個癟三的爭鬭。但是，但是一個「萬物之靈」的「人」，一個五官端正，四肢不缺的人，揷着草標待價而沽，竟沒有人問訊。我不知道這種情形，是不是「自古已然」？但是看到每一個路過的「人」，對於那被出賣的同類，沒有半點的憐憫或同情，似乎又不能不感到「於今爲烈」了！</p>
<p>我惘惘然地離開，我想假若杜甫生當今世，一定會高詠「生兒不如生猪好」了！</p>

<p>（二）悲與喜</p>
<p>厲又榭先說了人死不能復生，又說葉家如何形單影隻，然後說到秦潤之的話。維城沒聽完話，先就搖頭；一搖頭，他便感覺到頭痛，有好些話他是不曾聽到耳朶裏去。葉二太太道：「孩子，我不是幫着舅舅勸你，舅舅說的是通權達變，我想起來，倒也是個臨時辦法，現在，好，或是不好，都在你的嘴裏，你說一聲好，我們便先辦喜事，我住的房，立刻騰出來給你做新房。」維城呆呆的對葉二太太大姑奶奶厲又榭，每一個臉上看了看，不說什麼。大姑奶奶認爲維城是在考慮，便幫凑着葉二太太說了幾句。厲又榭笑道：「對外一切，有我們去對付，用不着你說一句話。自然喽，無論是我做維城，二嫂子大姑媽做維城，誰都開不出口，遭了大故，屍骨未寒，反而想先要謀室家之好。這個你不消憂慮得，我們會給你向親友們聲明，而且還料得到親友們一個個都原諫你。」維城被三個尊長，逼的把嚴霜罩着的臉上，有了笑容。但是這笑容，和曇花一現樣的。當在一現時，說道：「我眞不明白，什麽都不做，偏來做一個人，又偏去讀了一些書。」只是冷冷的兩句，再也沒有下文。葉二太太第一個領悟過來，陪着他一笑道：「舅舅，這個事情不談吧。維城，他不願意呢，他不是說做了人不能做這事，念了書便不能做這事嗎？本來，衛小姐沒有見過，她是瘦的是胖的，是賢慧的是會淘氣的，媒人的脾氣，又都是十個裏有九個人說謊，這難怪維城不願意。我說要辦喜事，這姻緣還該是落在翠珍姊身上。」維城父現着曇花一現的笑容，說道；「翠珍姊。」大姑奶奶想這是間不容髮的進言機會了，忙說道：</p>
<p>一翠珍姊，就是你的最好的朋友呀。算命的，算過她的命，小時受磨難，大了却是有幫夫運。嗯，這可比衛家的姑娘要好的多了。我猜維城再也不會批駁下來。」（四〇）</p>

<p>一個孩子，他將怎樣生活，怎樣死去呢？無論是誰，都不能知道這些事。而人們却因了互相憎惡，在無意中，爲一個孩子安排着難於居住的世界。</p>
<p>不可知的運命，將這樣的重擔，沈重　在那孩子的肩上擔着了。單是這個，不是已經儘够了嗎？而人們却還不是因了互想底憎惡，將更不能堪的重擔拋給那一個孩子不可嗎？（不受酬）</p>

<h3>Stalemated Anglo-Indian Negotiations: Rumors of US Mediation; Congress Resolution Still Unpublished; Cripps Striving to Overcome Difficulties</h3>
<p>Washington, 2nd (Havas) – The Washington Post today stated that President Roosevelt may step in to mediate the Indian question. The liberation of India has long been the hope of the American people, and Indian leaders deeply understand that American mediation would not raise concerns in India. Judging from India's attitude, it seems that it would rather achieve nothing than compromise on every point. However, such an attitude seems unwise at a time when India feels threatened.</p>
<p>Washington, 1st (Havas) – President Roosevelt met with India's representative to the United States, Babbé, tonight to discuss the political situation in India and the possibility of the Indian National Congress rejecting British proposals.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 2nd (Haitong Agency) – President Roosevelt is reportedly considering mediating the Indian issue. Well-informed sources in Washington believe that two facts indicate this trend: first, Sir Babbé, the Indian representative, met with President Roosevelt yesterday for a lengthy two-hour discussion, but afterwards refused to disclose the contents of the conversation to reporters; second, Washington newspapers have strongly argued that President Roosevelt should mediate the Indian issue. It is reported that Sir Babbé said that Sir Cripps's proposal is worthy of detailed study, the implication being particularly intriguing.</p>
<p>Washington, 1st (Reuters) – India's representative to the US, Bajjé, met with President Roosevelt yesterday for two hours. After the meeting, he told reporters, "I believe Cripps's proposal is more progressive than any previous proposal and deserves careful consideration." President Roosevelt discussed the functions of the Pacific War Council with me and did not touch upon Anglo-Indian relations. When asked whether Indian leaders seemed to have decided to reject Cripps's proposal, Bajjé replied in the affirmative, but added, "I still hope this matter can be resolved satisfactorily in the end."</p>
<p>Lisbon, 2nd (Alliance Agency) – According to reports from Washington, British efforts to persuade India to accept Cripps's proposals seem destined to fail. Therefore, there is a growing opinion in Washington that the United States should mediate the Indian issue. The Washington Post published an article yesterday advocating that President Roosevelt should act as a mediator. The article stated, "India's rejection of British proposals forces the American people to the almost inescapable conclusion that suspicions of Britain cannot be dispelled. This is the reason why other allied countries should take action. India's demands seem unbelievable." However, India's relapse into internal strife with Britain is an obstacle to victory. If the United States mediates, it will not be suspected.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 1st (Havas) – Sir Stafford Cripps's plan for India to become a dominion after the war has been rejected by the Indian National Congress and the Maha Sabha Party. The Maha Sabha Party's executive committee also issued a lengthy statement detailing several points in Sir Cripps's proposal that are still acceptable. However, Sir Cripps had previously stated that the British proposal must be accepted or rejected in its entirety, without any changes. Since the key points of the plan are now unacceptable, the Maha Sabha Party has no other option but to reject it.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 2nd (Reuters) – The Standing Committee of the Indian National Congress discussed the proposals regarding India's future constitution submitted by British envoy Sir Stafford Cripps for four and a half hours yesterday and will continue the discussion this morning. According to the party chairman, Achart Kuan, he is scheduled to meet with Cripps at 4:30 p.m. today. However, it is rumored that when Achart meets with Cripps today, he may inform him of the party's Standing Committee's resolution, stating the reasons for opposing the British proposal. The contents of this resolution may be announced tonight. In addition, the Standing Committee of the Indian Church has already issued a lengthy statement, stating that several points in Cripps's declaration are still barely satisfactory, but it is unfortunate that the British proposal must be accepted or rejected completely. Since several key points of the British proposal are difficult to accept in whole or in part, the Indian Church has no choice but to reject it. As for what the Indian Church finds difficult to agree with, one is the political division of India; the second is the lack of detailed information on how to handle the transition period in the British proposal; and the third is the defense issue. As for the statement issued by the National Congress in the Central Assembly, it stated that the British proposal is inadequate to meet the needs of the current situation in many aspects and poses more dangers to the future of India. For the sake of the Indian National Congress, the only option is to reject it.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 2nd (Reuters) – Cripps is scheduled to meet with representatives of the Council of Princes tonight.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 2nd (Reuters) – The resolution of the Standing Committee of the Indian National Congress may not be published immediately. It is expected that Cripps will make further efforts over the next few days to overcome various difficulties after receiving the Congress's letter of rejection. It is expected that when Mr. Cripps receives the resolution of the National Congress, if he implies that the British side welcomes the National Congress to submit a counter-proposal, then the National Congress may submit a counter-proposal to the British side.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 2nd (Havas) – British special envoy to India Sir Stafford Cripps has just officially stated that he originally planned to return home on the 6th of this month, but has now decided to postpone his return. The difficulties he has encountered in negotiations with representatives from all walks of life in India have gradually decreased, and he believes that some progress can be expected within the next week.</p>
<p>American Mediation Should Be Successful</p>
<p>Washington, 2nd (Reuters) – The Washington Post's editorial today stated that President Roosevelt may try to explore the possibility of mediating the Indian issue and that the United States sympathizes with India's aspirations. If President Roosevelt makes a proposal for mediation, India will not doubt the goodwill of the United States, because the United States has always been concerned about the issue of India's liberation, and the Indian people are well aware of this. As for China, it will also support the President's efforts. This is even more important, because China has made concrete suggestions to Britain. The British proposal is a demonstration of what the allied countries urgently need to express. If India cannot coordinate internally, the future of the war will inevitably be affected. In any case, Washington firmly holds this view. Regarding the defense issue, the British concessions to India stipulate that India can send representatives to participate in the British War Cabinet, as in the case of Australia's Gasser. In this way, India can express its opinions on war issues, but the Indian people do not have a clear understanding of this. The view of the Indian Church is that the British side must accept all of its opinions, and any compromise solution is difficult to accept. In fact, under the current circumstances, this attitude is unwise.</p>
<p>Congress Party's Rejection Resolution</p>
<p>New Delhi, 2nd (Reuters) – It is rumored that the issues discussed in the Congress Party's resolution to reject the British War Cabinet plan include: one, the part about defense; two, granting each province the freedom not to participate in the future Indian Federation; and three, the method for Indian states to send representatives to participate in the formulation of the constitutional system.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 2nd (Reuters) – The full text of the resolution of the Standing Committee of the Congress Party rejecting the British Cabinet's proposal will not be published immediately. It is expected that Cripps will continue his efforts in the coming days to complete the work of overcoming difficulties after receiving the exact wording of the Congress Party's resolution of opposition. Approximately, after Mr. Cripps receives the resolution, if he expresses a welcome for counter-proposals, the Congress Party will prepare such counter-proposals and submit them to Mr. Cripps within a reasonable time.</p>
<p>Suggesting the Organization of Anglo-Indian Allied Forces</p>
<p>Washington, 1st (Havas) – Senator Connally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, proposed last night that Britain immediately organize a joint Anglo-Indian command headquarters, because he believes that under the current circumstances, defending India is the most urgent task. After the establishment of the Anglo-Indian Joint Command, the anti-British sentiment in India can be eliminated. Although the US government is very pessimistic about the Anglo-Indian negotiations, it believes that Britain will be able to make concessions on several points, and at the same time hopes that Indian leaders can also make corresponding concessions. In short, I still hope that Special Envoy Cripps' trip can reach a compromise.</p>
<p>Indians Demand the Transfer of Power</p>
<p>New Delhi, 1st (United Press) – According to well-informed sources, Cripps has now issued an "urgent plea for help" to the British Cabinet, explaining the reactions of various political parties. Cripps stated therein that all circles in India unanimously demand that Indians be appointed as members of the National Defense Committee. If the British side can agree to this point, it may be possible to change the attitude of various circles to reject the British proposal. The leaders of the Nationalist Party, Sapru and Jayakar, issued a statement urging the British side to appoint Indians as members of the National Defense Committee, which may be the source of the above rumors. The current fact is that if Britain does not agree to modify the proposal, the All India National Congress will never accept the proposal. Other political parties, such as the Muslim League, also believe that if the National Congress rejects the proposal, then they do not need to consider the proposal. The Indian princes are also reacting poorly because the various points related to them in the proposal have not been clearly explained. It is reported that Gandhi and Nehru did not engage in drafting the statement of the National Congress. This task is now being handled by Balla Chari, the former Prime Minister of Madras Province. Cha is a moderate pro-British member of the Standing Committee of the National Congress. This point can indicate that the statement of the National Congress will contain detailed reasoning and concrete counter-proposals.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 1st (Reuters) – The person in charge of the Indian Hindu Maha Sabha stated that if the Maha Sabha today endorses any proposal that would cause any form or method of political division in India, it would violate its original intention and endanger the interests of India. The power of any province not to participate in the Federation is not allowed by the principle of self-determination, and such power must never be formulated by external authorities. India is now a unified country, and the existing provinces are all administratively united. Today, the situation of a sovereign country joining the Federation, or the situation of a sovereign country sacrificing part of its sovereignty for its common purpose, is not applicable to the provinces of India. The Maha Sabha's concern for all the future concerns mentioned in the declaration is that the Maha Sabha demands whether Britain is willing to immediately transfer power to India. India should immediately be declared an independent country and enjoy a free and equal position under the United Nations of Britain. The declaration guarantees that India will be given full national rights in the future, but the constitutional status of India during the transition period is not explained. Our national defense plan is especially unacceptable.</p>
<p>The Liberal Party is Seeking a Compromise</p>
<p>New Delhi, 2nd (Reuters) – A standing member of the Congress Party chatted with reporters today and expressed some disagreement with the British proposal. However, according to his observation of the current talks, it is very similar to the negotiations in 1931, when Gandhi and Lord Irwin (now Lord Halifax) conducted negotiations. After the initial seven days of suspicion and disappointment, they were finally able to sign a treaty. According to observations, some people, such as Liberal Party leaders Sapru and Jayakar, are now doing their best to seek a compromise. At the same time, the Standing Committee of the Muslim Congress has not yet revealed its intentions. Qin Na, the chairman of the Muslim Congress, who had dinner with Cripps yesterday, is now maintaining complete silence. The general feeling is that the future development of the negotiations will depend on Mr. Cripps's reaction to the Congress Party's letter and what concessions Mr. Cripps and Britain are prepared to make to meet the views of the Congress Party.</p>
<p>Britain Provides an Explanation</p>
<p>London, 2nd (Reuters) – The London Times today commented on the Indian comments on the British proposal under the title "(The Last Moment)". It is said that Special Envoy Cripps carried two proposals on this trip to India. One is very clear and concerns the status of India after the war. The second concerns the measures during the wartime transition period, and its content is inevitably somewhat vague. If the main point of the Indian National Congress's rejection is the second proposal, then we clearly know that they can still accept the core of the proposal. The Indian demand that the right to defend India should be immediately transferred to Indians actually needs to be further explained. In these troubled times, General Wavell's appointment as Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army is of practical benefit, and the American general today is also the commander of the Australian region, and his headquarters is located in Australia. When Wavell commanded the ABD defense zone in the past, the troops of several countries were under his command, but Wavell himself had to report to Washington. From this point of view, Wavell's position in India does not contain any contempt for India. If the Indian side agrees that Wavell maintains his current position to continue to be responsible to the War Council, the Indian side can also send representatives to attend the meeting. The issue of appointing Indians to positions in the British government, such as Minister of the Army, is also open to discussion. In short, General Wavell's task of implementing the overall strategy is very clear and should not be interfered with. Today's responsibility lies with the National Congress and other Indian spokesperson agencies. They should clearly express their judgment on the British proposal.</p>
<h3>Skirmishes in Batangas; Japanese Army Shells US Positions; Corregidor Island Also Attacked</h3>
<p>Washington, 2nd (Reuters) – According to the Army Department, there were only skirmishes on the Batangas Peninsula of the Philippines. Japanese warships also shelled US positions on the west coast of the peninsula, and the US front lines were bombed by Japanese dive bombers. The Corregidor Island fortress in Manila Bay was also attacked by Japanese aircraft from time to time. In the afternoon, Japanese artillery units on the Cavite coast also opened fire and shelled it. Earlier, Japanese infantry units had launched a fierce attack on US outposts around 8:00 p.m. on the 31st of last month. After a fierce bayonet fight, several US outposts were captured.</p>
<p>Washington, 1st (Reuters) – The Army Department issued the following communiqué based on information obtained before 9:00 a.m. this morning: In the Philippines, Japanese infantry launched a frontal attack on our army's defense line at 8:00 p.m. on the 31st. The Japanese army attacked our outer perimeter several times under the cover of mortar fire. The two sides fought hand-to-hand for several hours. Yesterday, Japanese aircraft bombed Corregidor Fortress in batches of two.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Alliance Agency) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:20 p.m. today that the Japanese naval air force had bombed Coranhetekoko from March 24 to March 31, destroying the US and Philippine military high-射 artillery positions on the island and thoroughly destroying the airport barracks and official residences.</p>
<h3>Axis Submarines Sunk: Over Twenty Vessels</h3>
<p>Washington, 1st (Reuters) – A US Navy spokesman said that a total of 21 Axis submarines had been sunk by the US Navy, 19 of which were sunk in the Atlantic and two in Pearl Harbor, including the three submarines recently sunk by the US Navy.</p>
<p>New York, 1st (Reuters) – Rear Admiral Simons, commander of the US East Coast naval station, declared that as a result of the Axis submarines' activities along the Atlantic coast, the submarines and personnel had paid a heavy price. Simons further stated that the submarine activity in the Atlantic is the worst threat we have suffered. The number of submarines operating on the coastal seas will be greatly reduced by US aircraft attacks.</p>
<h3>Gibraltar Bombed the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>Gibraltar, 1st (Havas) – A small squadron of aircraft flew over here before dawn tonight, taking advantage of the bright moonlight, and dropped bombs, but there were no casualties or losses on the ground. The local high-射 artillery unit immediately opened fire and drove them away. The air raid alert lasted for an hour and a half before it was lifted. Afterwards, according to the official communiqué, the enemy aircraft dropped many bombs, but there were no casualties or losses. According to reports, since the British port of Gibraltar was attacked by Italian bomber groups in July 1941, this is the first time the port has been bombed by enemy aircraft.</p>

<h3>Buddhist Burma (Part 1)</h3>
<p>Burma is our country's southwestern neighbor, its territory interlocked with our country's border like dogs' teeth, and its people share the same kind of kinship with our country. The characteristics of Burma, in addition to the towering coconuts, trees, and mangoes, are the golden and resplendent pagodas scattered throughout Burma, followed by the bald-headed monks in yellow robes. Burma is commonly known for its three abundances: "one monk, two pagodas, and three crows." It turns out that the Burmese people worship Buddhism, and in addition, Burma is an agricultural economic society, with abundant natural agricultural products, which gives them the constant strength to pursue spiritual life.</p>
<p>The Burmese people have healthy physiques, lively expressions, gentle hearts, and are charitable and generous, without accumulating wealth. Once they have money left over, they will subsidize Buddhist temples. From a young age, their spirits are nurtured by Buddhism, "believing that life is like crossing a sea of suffering," so they enjoy life to the fullest and live happily ever after.</p>
<p>The Burmese people are accustomed to worshiping pagodas, or going to temples to listen to Dharma masters' lectures, or sitting quietly in one place to read scriptures. Wealthy people build temples and pagodas, while poor people install water tanks and repair bridges by the roadside to benefit travelers and create blessings for the afterlife. The Burmese people believe in Buddhism (which has been selected as the state religion since ancient times). The Three Treasures of Buddhism—Sakyamuni, the Dharma, and the Sangha—are worshiped most devoutly. From infancy, mothers instill religious education in their children through lullabies, and Burmese women are especially devout. They worship the Buddha and pray in the morning, then give alms to monks, and in the evening, they must offer flowers and pray before the Buddha. These are simply the obligations that Burmese women believe are natural and righteous.</p>
<p>Not only do ordinary Burmese people believe in Buddhism in this way, but let's also look at King Mindon Min. He was generally quiet during his 20-year reign. He was a wise monarch in history. He was usually silent and spoke little, but when he did speak, it was good words—words that taught people to believe in Buddhism and cultivate goodness.</p>
<p>Pagodas Scattered Throughout the Territory</p>
<p>According to Swinnerton's "The Burmese's View of Life," "There is no reward for merit greater than building a pagoda." Therefore, in Burma, whether noble or lowly, everyone takes pleasure in building pagodas and temples. Some use public funds, spending vast sums of money, while others economize on food and clothing, gathering little by little, to achieve their goals. As a result, the pagodas of Burma are scattered throughout the territory. Travelers going up the Irrawaddy River can see the cone-shaped pagodas scattered like stars on the mountain peaks along the banks, vying for beauty. Their brilliant and harmonious colors, their tranquil and gentle yet elegant posture, accompanied by the harmonious chimes of the bells, how can they not make people empty of all thoughts and envy them endlessly! It is said that someone has roughly estimated that if the pagodas scattered throughout Burma were arranged in a vertical line, they could start from Hlegu, near Yangon, and extend all the way beyond Myitkyina in the far north. In other words, the line of pagodas could run through the entire territory of Burma from north to south with some to spare. The number is unimaginable.</p>
<p>The Burmese call pagodas "Zedi," which can be divided into four types: "Khaung-dú" Zedi are built on top of Buddhist relics or their models; "Paribawga" Zedi are built on top of eight kinds of divine objects or their models; "Aw-tá" Zedi contain Buddha statues; and "Damma-káya" (i.e., Buddha's teachings) Zedi contain Buddhist scriptures.</p>
<p>The location of the pagodas is mostly near mountains and rivers, and they are surrounded by lush mangoes, tall palm trees, and bananas with huge leaves. In such an environment, whenever the morning sun rises, or the evening glow slants, or on a moonlit night, the golden, shimmering buildings emit smiling reflections in the green embrace, and the beautiful reflections are submerged in the mirror-like water, also adorned with red lotus buds and green lotus leaves. The gentle chimes of the bells from the top of the pagoda are carried by the breeze, mixed with the monks' rhythmic chanting of scriptures in the temple. How can this scene not make people's minds wander!</p>
<p>The pagoda is a solid building, and one cannot climb to its top for a bird's-eye view, but can only admire it at the foot of the pagoda. The materials used to build the pagoda are bricks, limestone, and the exterior is coated with gold powder or lime. The shape of the pagodas is mostly bell-shaped, such as the Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon. Its exquisite elegance is enough to be appreciated. The top of the pagoda also has five or seven layers of small copper pagodas, like a copper umbrella, with carved flowers and plants, hanging with small bells and cymbals. When the breeze blows, they make a jingling sound. The top of the small copper pagoda is a diamond core, which is replaced by glass bottles in poor areas. This has two meanings: one is to resemble the shape of a lotus stamen, because according to the Buddhist scriptures, when Sakyamuni was in his mother Maya's body, he resembled a lotus stamen; and the other is to avoid lightning. Another important thing is that no matter what pagoda it is, it must contain a certain amount of sacred objects, otherwise the top of the pagoda cannot be opened. On the platform of the pagoda is a chapel for those who pray, with many large Buddhas, and inside there is one or several Buddha statues. In front of it, groups of Burmese people are making devout prayers. Next to the pagoda, in the temple, there is a kind of large bell, suspended in a corner of the temple, with a crossbar in the middle of the top, about a foot above the ground. The time to strike the bell is before and after prayers, striking with a corner. The sound is said to be able to invite the gods of heaven and earth to pay attention to their sincere prayers. Nearby, there must be a release pond, where aquatic animals such as fish, shrimp, and turtles are released.</p>
<p>Next to the pagoda is a monastery attached to it, the decoration of which is no less than that of other temples. There is also a nunnery, which is less luxurious than the monastery.</p>
<p>The guesthouse for pilgrims is often connected to the monastery, specially for pilgrims who have come from afar to rest. Anyone can stay inside, and the Burmese people generally do not have hotels, so they often go there for the night. Poor travelers regard it as a good place to stay.</p>
<p>Burma has two famous pagodas: one is the world-famous Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon, and the other is the most unique Kyaiktiyo Pagoda in all of Burma.</p>
<p>The Shwedagon Pagoda is not only famous throughout Burma, but also the most sacred and beautiful Buddhist temple in the Indochina Peninsula. This pagoda was built in the 16th century. It is 368 feet high, 118 feet higher than the Wat Arun in Siam, 68 feet higher than the Statue of Liberty in New York, and 120 feet lower than the highest pyramid in Egypt. This pagoda was only 27 feet high at first, but after seven renovations, it has become today's magnificent structure. The pagoda is solid and covered with gold powder. At the top is a weather vane, and below it is a gold umbrella weighing more than a ton, which was offered by King Mindon Min. There are 15,000 suspended bells above and below, of which more than 100 are made of gold and the rest are made of silver. The weather vane and the diamond lotus stamen are inlaid with 3,664 rubies, 511 emeralds, and 433 diamonds. It is truly worthy of being the king of pagodas.</p>
<p>The Kyaiktiyo Pagoda is built on a mountain range 10 miles away from Kyaikto (about 105 miles by car from Yangon). The mountain road is rugged and winding, and there are several places where the steep walls are vertical and there is no way to pass. Wooden ladders are provided to climb up, which is extremely dangerous. The Kyaiktiyo Pagoda is built on a large stone at the top of the mountain. The circumference of the stone is about 500-600 feet, weighing hundreds of thousands of pounds. Its lower part is in the shape of an acute angle, falling on a tall stone plate. People who want to go under the round stone must pass a wooden bridge. If tourists push the round stone, it will shake from side to side, but the pagoda stands firmly as before. This strange ancient architecture, which applies ingenious mechanics, is worthy of admiration.</p>
<h3>The Trial of the Attempted Assassination of Von Papen Begins; Defendant Saiman Confesses to the Crime</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 2nd (Havas News Agency) The Turkish Supreme Court began the trial yesterday morning for the attempted assassination of the German Ambassador to Turkey, Von Papen, on February 24th. The defendants are as follows: Saiman, a student; Sagor, a barber. Both are Turkish citizens, born in Yugoslavia. Kanilov, a Soviet citizen, handles commercial affairs at the Soviet Consulate General. Pavloff, a Soviet citizen. Before the trial began, there were many spectators around the court, with military police deployed to maintain order and prevent demonstrations. The defendants were brought to the court by car half an hour before the trial. The public gallery was extremely crowded. The court issued admission tickets, and only special correspondents were sent as representatives from Turkish and foreign journalists.</p>
<p>Brief Biographies of the Accused</p>
<p>Ankara, 2nd (Havas News Agency) Details have been ascertained regarding the trial of the four defendants in the attempted assassination of the German Ambassador to Turkey, Von Papen. Defendant Pavloff was born in Macedonia and is a member of the IMRO revolutionary party. He went to Moscow to join a terrorist group and claims to be a Soviet citizen. Saiman was born in 1907 and came to Turkey from Toulai three years ago. Sagor was born in 1917 and has resided in Turkey for three years. Kanilov is the head of the commercial affairs section of the Soviet Consulate in Istanbul. At the start of the trial, Pavloff denied being born in Macedonia, claiming he was from Chita in Siberia and was a historian. Saiman accused Kanilov and Pavloff of being the masterminds of the case. He claimed to be a Muslim with no connection to the Communist Party. He later met a woman named Anna and was enticed into the Communist Party. To sever his relationship with the woman, his parents sent him back to Istanbul from Belgrade University. Subsequently, he traveled from Istanbul to Yugoslavia several times, delivering documents to the Soviet Embassy in Ankara, and met Kanilov and Pavloff several times in Istanbul, receiving remuneration each time, specifically payment for providing information to the Bulgarian Soviet Embassy. He was introduced to Stephen by Pavloff. Stephen fled to Syria after the incident (the Turkish Foreign Ministry has requested extradition). Previously, he was a member of the Communist Party, but hated Soviet ideology after a friend was killed. Saiman confessed to the crime, requesting the death penalty. He is willing to provide a full confession. At this point, the court adjourned until the afternoon.</p>
<p>Afternoon Continuation of the Trial</p>
<p>Istanbul, 2nd (Havas News Agency) Yesterday afternoon, the trial for the attempted assassination of Von Papen continued. Defendant Saiman stated that he received 3,000 pounds from Kanilov, who promised to pay 30 to 35 pounds per month. The escaped Stephen taught Saiman's friend Dukat how to operate a handgun. Stephen also taught them how to throw bombs. Saiman was taught shooting by Pavloff. Saiman and Dukat, observing the preparations, suspected that they might be planning to assassinate Von Papen. Subsequently, Sagor was questioned. He was born in Yugoslavia in 1916. He stated that he received letters from Avdivis and Rifki requesting assistance for Nizeki. Upon arriving in Istanbul, Nizeki stated that he was going to Moscow and asked Sagor to send his luggage to Moscow. Sagor accepted 27 pounds, paid by Moes. Sagor then received orders to send the luggage to the Soviet Embassy in Turkey. Later, he went to the Soviet Embassy with a Polish engineer and visited Kanilov. Kanilov intended to maintain contact with Yugoslavia, so Sagor introduced Saiman to Kanilov to maintain contact. Dukat arrived in Ankara on January 15th and stayed at Sagor's house for 15 days. Dukat declared that if there was a Soviet-Turkish alliance, they could occupy Germany within a year, and the war could end sooner. Dukat received orders from Kanilov to assassinate the German Ambassador to Turkey, Von Papen. The judge asked why he did not report it to the police, to which Sagor could not answer. He admitted to attending Communist Party meetings several times, but stated he was not a Communist Party member.</p>

<h3>French Cabinet Rumored to Be Reorganized</h3>
<p>Geneva, 2nd (Havas News Agency) The Havas World News Agency's diplomatic correspondent issued a special dispatch today stating that when French Head of State Pétain met with former Prime Minister Laval last Thursday, the issue discussed was likely the relationship between France and Germany. Afterwards, Laval stayed in Paris for a short time and met with German Ambassador to the occupied zone of France, Abetz, several times. However, according to reliable sources, these talks were purely private. After Laval returned to the Chateau de Chartreton near Vichy this Tuesday, he did not meet with Head of State Pétain or Cabinet Associate Darlan. Contact may have been made through a third party. As for Germany, it is paying attention to the trend of opinion in French political circles, but its attitude towards France largely depends on the success or failure of the spring offensive on the Eastern Front. As for the situation of the French cabinet, since the death of Army Minister General Huntziger, the position of Army Minister has been vacant until now. The door to cabinet reorganization has been opened frequently, and the time for reorganization may be approaching.</p>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Havas News Agency) The German Foreign Ministry refused to disclose Laval's future role in French politics after discussing with French Head of State General Pétain and other government officials.

<h3>Continued Trial of the Riom Court; Two Witnesses in the Misgovernment Case</h3>
<p>Riom, France, 1st (Havas News Agency) The Riom Supreme Court summoned two witnesses this month in the misgovernment case. General Langlelois, who served as chief of staff under the late Army Minister General Huntziger, stated that in May 1940, he served as commander of the 3rd Division. The division was inadequately equipped, so it was difficult to resist the German army's fierce attacks on the first encounter. However, their morale and calm attitude in the face of difficulty were commendable. In short, the French government officials at the time lacked a realistic understanding. They never really believed in the war, and the false news published by various newspapers poisoned public opinion to the extreme. General Steller, who served as aide-de-camp to Prime Minister Daladier for two years, continued to speak, saying that the claim that the army was controlled by politics was not true. As for armaments, they were expected to be sufficient for resistance. For example, as of May 1, 1940, we had a total of 2,300 modern tanks, which increased to 2,700 by the end of the month. It can be seen that the total tonnage of our tanks at that time was at least comparable to Germany's. The president of the court inquired about the procurement of armaments. General Steller replied that the allocation of armaments when ordering them was indeed decided by Jaccomet, the supply officer of the General Staff, but his position was not Minister of Armaments. However, Jaccomet could also have a say when there was unused funds.</p>

<h3>Norwegian Ships Anchored in Sweden Sail to England; Intercepted by German Warships En Route; Two Ships Sunk, Totaling 16,000 Tons</h3>
<p>Gothenburg, Sweden, 2nd (Havas News Agency) Eleven Norwegian ships that had fled to this port for refuge since the outbreak of the war attempted to escape to England yesterday morning.

According to a Reuters dispatch from London received here today, these ships have been leased by the British government from the Norwegian government, and the captains have been replaced by British personnel.</p>

Since the Swiss Consul General revealed news of ongoing negotiations between the American and Japanese governments regarding an exchange of officials, followed by the Japanese Consulate General's announcement of registration for the evacuation of Allied nationals (excluding British, American, Dutch, and Belgian citizens).

It is understood that two Brazilian ships have already set sail from South America, preparing to transport nationals exchanged for evacuation between the United States and Japan. As for the evacuation of British, Dutch, and Belgian officials and nationals in this port, no plan has been drafted, nor has registration begun. Only several discussions have been held by the parties concerned. However, due to the fact that the home countries of Britain, the Netherlands, and Belgium are located in Europe, which makes shipping inconvenient, and that the Netherlands and Belgium have already been occupied, their evacuation issues are more complicated. It is said that British, Dutch, and Belgian nationals will also be evacuated to the United States or Canada. The truth of this remains to be verified.</p>
<p>Danish Consulate Investigates Businesses</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Danish Consul General in this port, Mr. Hill, issued a notice yesterday, announcing the investigation of Danish businesses and the registration of nationals. The following is a translation of the two notices: (A) "All Danish owners of Danish businesses, warehouses, factories, properties, and houses within the Shanghai (referring to the Public Settlement, French Concession, and western Shanghai) area are requested to immediately come to this Consulate General in person to report all details for the inquiries of the Japanese authorities in this port."</p>
<p>Registering Nationals Simultaneously</p>
<p>(B) "For the convenience of the Japanese authorities in this port, this Consul General hereby requests Danish nationals in Shanghai (referring to the two concessions and western Shanghai) to report the following items to the Danish Consulate General immediately: 1. Name; 2. Address; 3. Gender; 4. Occupation (type of occupation and name and address of workplace); 5. Age; 6. Date of obtaining Danish nationality (date of birth, marriage, or naturalization). The above locations and addresses must be stated in detail.

<h3>Tomorrow is Children's Day; Children's Welfare Association Appeals for Donations</h3>
<p>Tomorrow is the 11th Chinese Children's Day, and all circles in Shanghai are enthusiastically celebrating it. According to the Chinese Children's Welfare Association, the association currently cares for more than 500 orphaned children. Regular supplies are already difficult to provide. At this time of rising prices, especially for rice, it is truly difficult to continue. Therefore, on this Children's Day, an appeal is made to kind people from all walks of life to generously donate, so that funds are available and the educational work is not interrupted. This is truly immeasurable public virtue. The association's office is at Room 208, China Merchants Bank Building, 110 Edward Road, telephone number 82273.</p>
<h3>British Merchant Ships Converted to Transport After Leaving Hong Kong. A Total of Twelve Vessels Were Confiscated. Ships That Left Hong Kong are Now in India and Australia.</h3>
<p>Since December 8th of last year, the shipping situation has changed drastically. Jardine Matheson and Swire, two companies with more than a century of history in China, held authority in the shipping industry. Branch offices were established in all ports in the north and south and along the Yangtze River, with business surpassing the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Jardine Matheson had thirteen river steamers and more than twenty ocean-going vessels. Swire had more than fifty ocean-going vessels and twenty river steamers.</p>
<p>A Time of Unparalleled Dominance in Shipping</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, river steamers ceased operations, and shipping in the north and south flourished. Profits were even greater than before the incident. At that time, due to the suspension of Chinese shipping, the two companies dominated shipping in the north and south. Shipping costs and ticket prices increased repeatedly. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, vessels of both companies rushed to Hong Kong, Singapore, and various locations in Southeast Asia. Six Swire vessels moored at Hankou, Wenzhou, Wuhu, Wusong, Changsha, Shashi, and Xiangtan, and three Jardine Matheson vessels, Baohua, Longhua, and Jihua, were confiscated, totaling nine vessels. Baohua and Longhua have been assigned to sail the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Three Swire ocean-going vessels, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and New Beijing, were captured at sea and escorted to Shanghai. They are currently moored on the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>Eight Vessels Were Scuttled in Hong Kong</p>
<p>Swire vessels in Hong Kong that failed to leave in time included Chengdu, Ganzhou, Nanning, and Suzhou, four vessels. Jardine Matheson had Rising Sun, Fusheng, Guisheng, and Mingsheng (one of the New Sihai vessels), four vessels. A total of eight vessels were ordered to be scuttled. The crew members all landed safely. The remaining vessels sailed south completely and are now in various ports in India and Australia. Swire is said to have twenty-six vessels in India and Australia, and the number for Jardine Matheson is unknown. However, all have been placed under the control of the British Admiralty and converted into transport ships, exclusively for military use.</p>
<h3>Post-Settlement Arrangements for Elderly, Weak, Disabled, and Destitute Refugees. Food Provided by the Shanghai Municipal Council.</h3>
<p>After the repatriation of refugees from this port, only the remaining elderly, weak, orphans, disabled, and destitute individuals remained. Because they are truly unable to be repatriated, arrangements are still needed. Our newspaper reporters have once again investigated the situation and recorded the following:</p>
<p>Post-Settlement Arrangements Agreed</p>
<p>The refugees housed by the Tzu Lien Branch at the Jessfield Road and Tianhou Palace locations are mostly elderly, weak, and disabled. Apart from those who could be repatriated, who have already been sent out, there are still more than 300 people who cannot survive without assistance. Therefore, after the association consulted with the Shanghai Municipal Council and other charitable organizations, a meeting was held at the Pudong Fellow Provincials Association a few days ago. After collective discussions, it was decided that the Shanghai Municipal Council would take over, maintain the provision of food, and concentrate the elderly and disabled refugees at the Tze Yuan Refugee Shelter on North Zhejiang Road.</p>
<p>Centralized Shelter</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, Western staff members, together with representatives from the Tzu Lien General Association, transferred a portion of the elderly and weak refugees, totaling 115 people, to the Tze Yuan Refugee Shelter on North Zhejiang Road for resettlement. More than 200 people will also be gradually concentrated and sent to the shelter within days. The provision of food will continue to be provided by the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the Tzu Lien General Association will assist in the management.</p>
<h3>Parcels to Rongcheng Resumed</h3>
<p>Parcel Notice from the Shanghai Postal Administration: Regarding the suspension of acceptance of parcels and bulk small packets to the Rongcheng Bureau in the Beiping area, as notified in Parcel Notice No. 405, it has been verified that parcels and bulk small packets to Rongcheng Chengguan can now be resumed for acceptance.

<h3>More Than 2,000 Second-Hand Landlord Licenses Issued. Reports of Licenses Issued in Each District Compiled on the Same Day. License Issuance Period Limited to the End of This Month.</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Council began issuing subletting licenses the day before yesterday, yesterday was the second day. Second-hand landlords carrying application forms to the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rates Office and various district offices were extremely crowded.</p>
<p>License Issuance Situation</p>
<p>According to inquiries by a Datong News Agency reporter, since the Shanghai Municipal Council began issuing subletting licenses the day before yesterday at the Rates Office No. 506, the number of second-hand landlords residing in the central district who went to collect them yesterday was quite large. A temporary subletting license issuance office was specially opened opposite the bicycle license window in the Rates Office to alleviate the congestion.</p>
<p>Issuance Hours</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Rates Office's license issuance hours are set from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM. However, the actual license issuance time in the afternoon is only until 3:00 PM, because after 3:00 PM, account consolidation procedures must be carried out. At the same time, the license issuance hours of various district offices are also from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM. After 3:00 PM, each district office should send the total number of licenses issued for the day, along with the license fees, to the Rates Office to be included in the general ledger.</p>
<p>Number of Licenses Issued</p>
<p>According to inquiries by a Datong News Agency reporter, the total number of subletting licenses issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council Building Rates Office, together with various district offices, was 1,332 on the first day (i.e., April). The number issued yesterday was also several thousand. The deadline for the issuance of these licenses is set for the end of this month at the latest. Those who fail to collect them by the deadline will be severely punished. After obtaining this license, it should be hung in a conspicuous place in the house together with the inventory table (which must be filled out item by item) and the ceramic license plate.</p>
<h3>American Nationals Association Aiding American Prisoners of War. Relatives' Letters Must Not Be Sealed.</h3>
<p>The American Prisoners of War Relief Committee of the American Nationals Association in this city recently appealed to residents of Shanghai to donate food and clothing to be given to American prisoners of war detained in Shanghai. Many responded and donated generously. After packaging, the first batch was shipped out by military vehicle the day before yesterday (the 1st).</p>

<p>According to the chairman of the Relief Committee, Mr. White, yesterday morning (the 2nd), Lieutenant Matsuda, the assistant spokesman for the Japanese Army, has agreed to deliver the batch of parcels to the prisoner of war camp.

There were also some cigarettes and soap, as well as baseball bats and gloves for baseball. In the food category, there were donations ranging from chocolate candy and jam to meat, as well as aspirin tablets, coffee, milk, and butter. There were also 48 books and 89 magazines and comic books to help the American prisoners pass the time.</p>
<p>American Prisoners of War Engage in Sports in Camp</p>
<p>It is verified that not long ago, the Japanese authorities had gifted American prisoners with radios and baseball bats. Yesterday, five more baseball bats, four balls, and four gloves were transported for the American prisoners to use. American prisoners are allowed to engage in various sports in the camp. Among the clothing items were 131 athletic shirts, more than 500 pairs of socks, as well as raincoats, slippers, bathrobes, and some shirts. The Japanese authorities will also deliver letters from relatives in Shanghai and North China to the prisoners of war. However, these letters must not be sealed. The Relief Committee continues to operate, hoping to provide supplies to the majority of prisoners, and is currently formulating a plan to cooperate with the Japanese authorities to expand its scope of services.</p>
<h3>Tenth Anniversary of the French Concession's White Russian Auxiliary Police</h3>
<p>Members of the White Russian Auxiliary Police of the French Concession Police Department held a solemn service yesterday (the 1st) at the Russian Orthodox Church to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the team's founding. However, due to the upcoming Easter holiday, there will be no large-scale celebrations.

<h3>Gambling Den Broken Up on Avenue Edward VII, 74 Arrested</h3>
<p>The Fuxing Tea House at No. 5, 7, and 9, Alley 18, Avenue Edward VII, is a disguised gambling den that has been operating for many days, attracting crowds to gamble day and night, profiting from commissions. This was discovered by Japanese Detective Urakami and Chinese Detective Shi Huanting of the Hongkou Police Department. Yesterday, they secretly went to investigate and raid the premises, arresting the owner, Chen Shouchun, and gamblers Shen Yinbiao, Lin Gui, Qi An, Yong Kuan, Hu Yuezhen, Zhou Xiuzhen, Cen Linbao, and others, a total of 74 men and women (of whom 15 were female offenders). Together with gambling funds of 740 yuan and six jiao, one set of dominoes, four shaking cylinders, and three pieces of cloth, they were taken to the police station. Chen Shouchun was ordered to be detained, while the remaining 73 gamblers were allowed to be released on bail of 50 yuan each, pending further investigation.</p>

<h3>Dismissed Apprentice Conspires with Thugs to Intimidate Shop Owner. Liu Fuchang Receives Threatening Letters. Three Suspects Have Been Arrested One After Another.</h3>
<p>Liu Fuchang, the owner of Mingchang Bookstore at No. 741 Avenue Joffre, received several threatening letters last month, stating that he was required to lend 2,000 yuan, otherwise drastic measures would be taken, etc. The letters were signed "Shanghai Concession Troops". Liu dismissed the letters with a smile. Unexpectedly, he received another letter the day before yesterday, and two thugs, Zhang Mugang and Fang Zhongcheng, went to Mingchang Bookstore, saying they wanted to meet with the shop owner, Liu Fuchang, to talk. Seeing that the situation was not good, Liu immediately telephoned the French Police Department, which immediately dispatched detectives to the bookstore and arrested Zhang and Fang, and confiscated a pistol and five bullets from their persons, and took them to the police station. Zhang and Fang confessed that they were truly poor and helpless and had conspired with Tang Yizhou, a dismissed apprentice from the store, to borrow 1,000 yuan from the owner of Mingchang Bookstore to start a small business, and they dared not act illegally, and asked for leniency. Subsequently, yesterday afternoon, detectives went to Room 229, Dalu Apartment, and arrested Tang Yizhou and took him to the police station, ordering him to be detained, pending a joint investigation and prosecution.</p>
<h3>Sneaking into the Racecourse to Steal a Bicycle</h3>
<p>The Englishman, Cyril Spencer Archard, 28 years old, residing at No. 12, Lane 833, Avenue Joffre, previously served as a Western Constable in the Public Police Department, but was ordered to be dismissed for improper conduct. At 8:40 AM on the 1st of this month, the Englishman sneaked into the Mahok Road Racecourse. At that time, Huang Qinglian, a Chinese compradore from the Fair Road Huashun Wharf, was practicing horseback riding and had deposited his bicycle in the open space of the racecourse. The Englishman took the opportunity to steal it and attempted to escape, but was spotted by a groom, Ma Gongfu, who arrested him and reported it to the Chengdu Road Police Station, who ordered detectives to take him to the police station for detention. He was sent to court on the morning of the 2nd, requesting permission to detain him for further investigation.</p>

Afterwards, the police arrested several of the robbers in the case one after another and sentenced them to imprisonment. Most recently, the Old Zhabei Police Department discovered the whereabouts of Zhong Jin'an, the principal offender in the case, also known as "Golden Monk", and arrested Zhong and confiscated 41 stolen watches of various types. After the police investigation was completed, Zhong Jin'an was sentenced yesterday to six years of imprisonment for robbery as a warning.</p>
<h3>A Group of Three: Gang Robbery of Overshoes, Impoverished and Desperate to Take the Risk</h3>
<p>Shi Ronghua, a local resident of Shanghai, forty-two years old, residing at No. 2 Yongquan Village, Henry Road, French Concession, purchased sixty-two pairs of rubber overshoes from a certain place on the afternoon of the 28th of last month at 5 o'clock, valued at over eight hundred yuan. He was carrying them with him when he passed by the Nanyang Hospital on Route Sapey, French Concession, when suddenly, thirty or so people rushed forward and snatched all the overshoes and fled. At that time, Shi, in a moment of desperation, shouted for robbers. Patrol officers heard the sound and arrived, apprehending eight people, including Wang Chunmao, Wang Ruxi, Shi Jiaming, Chen Manhong, Zhuang Mingdong, Zhang Ayu, and Jiang Ahai, and intercepting over thirty pairs of the stolen goods. The remaining accomplices and the remaining stolen goods had scattered and escaped, making it impossible to pursue and recover them. The apprehended criminals were immediately taken to the police station. According to Wang and others' confession, they were driven to break the law due to poverty and desperation. The police chief ordered them to be detained pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>Jews and Hot Money</h3>
<p>— Gan</p>
<p>Since the expulsion of Jews from the European continent, Shanghai has become a haven for them. Those with assets brought their capital early to this oriental paradise, and even those without a penny to their name were successively sent to the city on refugee ships. Now, walking from the French Concession to Hongkou, you can encounter Jews everywhere. These Jews are indeed very capable; they can not only survive in Shanghai, but also influence the city's market.</p>
<p>Originally, the name "Jew" seemed to be synonymous with "money-grubber." They have no country, they do not recognize ethnicity, and their sole pursuit is profit, is hard currency. The Jews' ability to pursue profit is unparalleled in the world. First, the method of arranging and allocating capital is extremely clever. They practiced in the European market and brought a copy of their skills to Shanghai, of course, to use them with ease and mastery. They certainly have no concept of country or ethnicity, but they are most adept at banding together for the sake of profit. For example, if one person hoards a certain commodity, the impact is ultimately small. But Jews will band together to hoard goods and use various methods to influence the market. As a result, a certain commodity indeed soared in price day and night, rising to the point where it could no longer rise, and then they emerged, dumping the rotten goods on others. The Jews have made a fortune. This refers to the Jews who came to Shanghai with capital to trade stocks and speculate. As for the penniless Jews, they also brought a set of skills with them. Some can repair clocks and watches, some can prepare prescriptions, some can draw and play music, some can paint and decorate, and some can make cosmetics, and cook Western food. Thus, they start by carrying a tattered leather bag, wandering around selling small sundries, rising step by step, eventually acquiring half a storefront, gradually expanding and occupying a large storefront, and further hiring Chinese staff. They themselves have also learned a set of necessary Shanghai dialect. These ordinary propertyless Jews have also established themselves in Shanghai. The Jews truly deserve to be called Jews. Chinese merchants, no matter how skilled, are no match for the Jews.</p>
<p>The businesses operated by Jews in Shanghai are already enough to affect the market and make consumers suffer. Even more ferocious, more difficult to deal with, and more indifferent to the lives and deaths of consumers than the Jews is the large sum of hot money squeezed into Shanghai.</p>
<p>Before the outbreak of the Pacific War, the hot money squeezed into Shanghai was used for foreign exchange, stocks, hoarding, real estate, and the like. After the outbreak of the war, it was used for military scrip and hoarding. Because there was too much hot money, even the authorities tried everything to control it but could not. Daily necessities followed the rise of foreign exchange and military scrip and rose like lightning. A sheet of carbon paper that originally cost a few cents would rise to a few dollars a sheet, something that even insiders could not dream of. The reason is that the hot money squeezed in, drilled into every hole, and was all-pervasive. The rise and fall of commodity prices were completely without any standard. Bai Que Ji-style ointment, which was originally something that could be dispensed with, became popular because of the extensive advertising and the old brand name. Everyone wanted to hoard it. This seemingly useful but actually useless ointment rose from a few cents a box to three, five, ten, or even twenty times... and everyone was still expecting it to rise. Similarly, heat rash medicine and mosquito coils, etc., were being snapped up in large quantities even before they were in season.</p>
<p>Those who hoard and speculate, buy forward contracts, and hoard banknotes, etc., do not care at all about the soaring prices of daily necessities. Because they have made a windfall, they think that even if the price of rice rises to six hundred yuan per dan, it will be at the expense of others. The more expensive things are, the more they don't care. As for ordinary law-abiding people who live honestly, they suffer greatly, from having a little savings to becoming debt-ridden, from being middle-class to becoming penniless, from being propertyless to becoming beggars, and from beggars to becoming corpses on the street. Those who own hot money and make a fortune do not care about the dead. They still drill into every hole they can find, wanting to make even more money after making a fortune!</p>
<p>Under the dual pressure of Jews and hot money, the poor people naturally have only one way to go: to sit and wait for death.</p>

<h3>Business Director of Livestock Plantation Company, Cashes Checks and Spends Lavishly, Close Friend Deceived, Detained and Released on Bail</h3>
<p>Shen Weisheng, a local resident of Shanghai, thirty-three years old, residing at No. 6 Xinyang Village, Gansdong Road, Lafayette Road, is the manager of Jinshan Trading Company and Hefeng Trading Company, and the business director of Shanghai Livestock Plantation Company. He is fond of pleasure-seeking, leading to a mountain of debt. He had a strange idea and issued a check for 60,000 yuan from the China Reclamation Bank to his close friend Xie Mijing to exchange for cash. After obtaining the money, he spent it lavishly, purchasing cars and diamond rings, etc., living a life of luxury. When the check matured, it could not be cashed due to insufficient funds. Xie negotiated with Shen, but Shen avoided meeting him. The Jinshan Company he opened had also closed down long ago. Xie realized he had been deceived and reported the situation to the authorities, requesting an arrest warrant. Xie learned that Shen was hosting a banquet at the Dahua Restaurant on Huage Nie Road. Xie accompanied detectives from the French Concession Police Station to arrest him and released him on 20,000 yuan bail pending investigation.</p>
<h3>Woman Arrested for Carrying Opium, Three Ounces Missing from Case, Authorities Order Detectives to Investigate the Truth</h3>

She was prosecuted for the crime of transporting drugs. During the investigation by the authorities, it was discovered that only twenty packets of opium, a total of nine ounces, were found in the case, short of four packets, totaling three ounces. The police chief verified the words and immediately ordered the detective handling the case to be responsible for the investigation to clarify the truth, otherwise, a thorough investigation would be conducted according to the law.</p>

<h3>A General Overview of Jesuit Translations and Writings Over the Past Hundred Years</h3>
<p>— Xu Zongze</p>
<p>This year marks the hundredth anniversary of the return of Jesuit priests to China. In these hundred years, the books translated and written by the priests have been quite considerable. Now, I will give a general overview.</p>
<p>Since St. Ignatius founded the Society of Jesus in 1540, the Jesuits soon spread throughout the world. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, Matteo Ricci also came to our country to preach in 1583. In 1773, Pope Clement XIV, under pressure from those who hated the holy church, ordered the abolition of the Society of Jesus. The Jesuits in China were also dissolved on November 15, 1775, by order of Rome.</p>
<p>However, things reach their extreme and then turn around, which is the norm. Pope Pius VII issued a decree in 1814, restoring the Society of Jesus. The Jesuits in various European countries were thus restored. Our Chinese priests and Catholics learned of this news and also wrote to Pope Gregory XVI of Rome and Father General Laudani of the Society of Jesus, requesting them to send priests to return to China. The Pope and the Father General agreed and sent three French priests, Gotteland, Esteve, and Brueyre, who set off for China on April 20, 1841, and arrived in Shanghai on July 11 of the following year.</p>
<p>The Origin of the Name Xujiahui</p>
<p>After the three priests arrived in Shanghai, they revived the missionary work. In 1847, they purchased land in Xujiahui to build a church and residence, and Xujiahui became the center of Jesuit missionary work from then on. Xujiahui is the location of the tomb of the Ming Dynasty Prime Minister Xu Wending. His descendants lived there for generations. It is also the confluence of the Zhaojia Creek and the Fahua Creek, hence the name Xujiahui. After the priests chose Xujiahui as their central location, various cultural undertakings were also established there one after another. The Xujiahui Library began operating in 1847, collecting books. Xuhui Middle School, originally named St. Ignatius College, was founded in 1850. The Tushanwan Orphanage was established in 1864. In 1873, the observatory was established. In 1879, the Yiwun Daily was published, and in 1887, the Sacred Heart News was published. All cultural work was gradually developed. Now, let's just talk about the translations and writings.</p>
<p>Over the past hundred years, most of those in the Society of Jesus who held pens and wrote books were priests of Chinese nationality, and Western priests had no Chinese writings. Among the writers of Chinese nationality, most were from Jiangsu, followed by Xian County in Hebei, then Anhui and Guangdong, because the New Society of Jesus was concentrated in Jiangsu Province. Most of the books they compiled and wrote were religious, including the Bible, apologetics, theology, philosophy, morality, worship, catechism, church history, science, and other books. In terms of quantity, there are hundreds of kinds, more than the publications of the Old Society of Jesus. In terms of quality, it seems no less than the Old Society of Jesus, but its influence has not been able to catch up with its predecessors, which is due to the trend of the times. The New Society of Jesus arrived in Shanghai in 1842 and this year, 1942, within a century, the books compiled and written can be divided into three periods.</p>
<p>Compiled and Written Books Divided into Three Periods</p>
<p>The first period is from 1842 to 1879, which can be called the founding period. During this period, the first booklet published was the "General Questions and Answers of the Holy Church," signed by Nanyue Delang, a Jesuit from the West, translated and compiled, and Zhuang Xingjian from Chuansha participated in the revision. The second book was "Explanation of the Jubilee," written by Zhao Deli Zottli, a Jesuit from the Far West. Chao was an Italian. At that time, he was the principal of St. Ignatius College in Xujiahui and later the spiritual director of the Jesuit novices. Not only did he have a large number of students, but many of them were disciples who were good at literature, such as Ma Liang, Xiang Bo, and Li Linwen Yu. Only more than a dozen kinds of books were published during this period.</p>
<p>The second period is from 1879, the year the Yiwun Daily was founded, to 1911, the day the Huibao was discontinued. This period can be called the prosperous period. Not only was the publication prosperous during this period, but the cultural undertaking was formally organized, and the Varietes Sinologiques, the Chinese Studies Research Society, was founded. Those in charge were Xia Minglei Havret, and those who assisted were Chinese priests Li Lin (Wen Yu), Shen Zekuan, Pei Zhai, Jiang Sheng, Xu Huan, Xu Youxi, and Zhang Yushan. Father Huang Bolu of Haimen was also a famous sinologist, known in Europe and the United States. Sixty-six kinds of Chinese Studies Series have been published to date.</p>
<p>In addition to the Chinese Studies Series, Xu Huan also organized a cultural institution, namely, the publication of Yiwun Daily. It was initially scheduled to be published twice a month. The first issue was published on March 16, 1879. From the eleventh issue onwards, the newspaper was published once every seven days. At that time, in addition to the Shanghai Shenbao, there were few newspapers, such as the Nongxing. Once the Yiwun Daily was published, it spread like wildfire and became popular throughout the country. In 1887, the Sacred Heart News was also published once a month. These two newspapers were founded by Father Li Wenyu (Lin). The Yiwun Daily was later renamed Huibao, and was published twice every seven days. It was discontinued in 1911 and reorganized into the Sacred Church Magazine. The Sacred Heart News has been published to this day without interruption.</p>
<p>Among the publications in this second period, about 100 kinds of books were published in the first 20 years, most of which were sacred books. After the Wuxu Coup, the Qing court advocated Western learning, so the priests compiled and translated Kobe, and published many books, which were quite popular with the society. Father Li Wenyu alone wrote more than 60 kinds of books in 33 years. Father Li was indeed a representative figure in this period. He was from Nanhui, Jiangsu, born in 1840 and died in 1911. After Father Li's death, the publications of Xuhui entered a new period.</p>
<p>The third period is from the year the Sacred Church Magazine was founded to the present. The first issue of the magazine was published in January 1912, once a month. The founders and editors were Father Pan Qiulu, a priest from Qingpu, Jiangsu, born in 1867 and died in 1921. The deputy editor was Father Zhang Yushan, a priest from Nanhui, Jiangsu, born in 1872 and died in 1929. He was also a famous sinologist and wrote many books. The content of the Sacred Church Magazine is mostly about defending the truth and researching scholarship, and it pays special attention to modern thought. Therefore, once it was published, it was not only popular among religious readers, but also among scholars outside the church, and many overseas Chinese in Europe and the United States subscribed to it. In September 1938, it was temporarily suspended due to environmental reasons.</p>
<p>In the early stage of this third period, the publications included the compilation of textbooks, from elementary school to middle school, there were textbooks in classical Chinese and vernacular Chinese, which were published by the Tushanwan Printing House. After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing in 1927, the ideological trend changed greatly again. The general public paid attention to democracy and civil rights, and socialism and communism were widely promoted. At this time, the publications of the priests included books on civics, the Three People's Principles, sociology, economics, and so on. At the same time, many books on theology and philosophy were also published. There were also various small series of books published, which were quite in line with the trend of the times.</p>
<p>In August 1927, Xu Huan organized a translation and compilation office, namely, Guangqi Society. Shanghai Xu Guangqi used culture to promote the public church, so the society took his name to commemorate him. The purpose of Guangqi Society is to translate and compile books on religion and scholarship to communicate Chinese and Western culture. The scope is even wider than the Institute of Chinese Studies, and many books have been published. In addition, the Jesuits who preach in our country are scattered in various provinces, of different nationalities, and belong to different provincial capitals. Recently, in order to connect the Chinese publishing undertakings of the Jesuits across the country, a liaison office for Chinese publications of the Jesuits across the country was established in Xuhui in 1940, so that they can report to each other and communicate information.</p>
<p>Remarkable Achievements in a Hundred Years</p>
<p>As for the content of various books, they all have something to say, and they are beneficial to morality and learning. As for the writing style, some are profound and gorgeous, and some are simple and clear. In short, there are differences in style and custom due to the different classes of readers. Moreover, the writings of the New Jesuits are not like those of the Old Jesuits, who rely on the embellishment of Han Cao or the preface and postscript of celebrities. Because of this, the works of the New Priests are not praised by high officials and writers, and they are rarely spread among foreigners. Believers recite them daily as a method of self-cultivation. But there is a subtle and indelible truth in them, which, once revealed, will be appreciated by each other. For example, Mr. Zhou Zuoren said about Imitation of Christ: "This Imitation of Christ is a book that I like, although I am not a Catholic. I heard that this is a representative work of medieval Christian thought, but it does not have the strictness of a moralist, and its purpose is close to mysticism, which makes us feel very interesting. From the point of view of writing, it is also a very valuable book." Zhou Zuoren wrote his own garden, page 200.</p>
<p>In this century, the books published or reprinted by the Jesuits, in terms of both quality and quantity, there are many important books such as "A New Compilation of History and Straightforward Lectures," "The Complete New Testament," "A New Translation of the New Testament," "The Essence of the Source of Truth," "The Complete Book of Meditation," "The Correct Standard of Cultivation," "Introduction to Cultivation," "Outline of Theology," "Outline of Philosophy," "Essentials of Supernaturalism," "Exploration of Names and Principles," "Xu's Kitchen Words," and so on.</p>
<p>Based on this, the publications of the New Jesuits in this century are already remarkable, and there are still many Western books, Chinese-French dictionaries, dictionaries, maps, and novels that have not been mentioned one by one. Now, according to the book list of the Tushanwan Printing House (1941), there are 971 kinds of books, and the book list of the Tianjin Chongde Hall (1940) has 816 kinds. Publications from Anqing, Wuhu, Bengbu, Chongqing, Xuzhou, and Macau have not yet been included. However, among the 1,787 kinds of books mentioned above, single sheets, pamphlets, and reprints of the works of the Old Jesuits are also counted in them.</p>
<p>The above is just a general overview, as a memorial. In the future, cultural undertakings will surely be even more remarkable.</p>
<h3>Pleading for Refugee Children</h3>
<p>Ding Fubao's letter pleading for the refugee children of the Shanghai Fuyou Orphanage says: "Since the opening of the Shanghai Fuyou Orphanage, more than 90 refugee children have been sent by various charitable organizations. Most of the refugee children are thin and weak, and their faces are sallow. Many suffer from internal medicine, surgery, and skin diseases. In addition, they are poorly clothed and hungry. They are truly the most pitiful people in the world. However, the nature of the refugee children is the same as ours. All human beings are equal and there is no difference. It is only that their circumstances are slightly unfortunate. If the powerful people today treat the refugee children with equality, first provide them with clothing and food to relieve their hunger and cold, then treat their diseases with medicine, use hygiene methods to make them healthy, and use education methods to enlighten their talents in filial piety, fraternity, loyalty, trustworthiness, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, as well as various sciences. After ten or twenty years, who knows if various talents will emerge from these refugee children? We are old and like the setting sun, with little remaining light, while the refugee children are like the rising sun, and soon will be in the middle of the day. They are truly the most promising people in the world. However, without the powerful, they cannot be saved. Today, April 4th, is Children's Day. Fubao sincerely asks the powerful to help the refugee children of the Shanghai Fuyou Orphanage and to seek ways to expand and improve the orphanage. That would be fortunate. The office is located at No. 204 Meibaige Road, telephone number 31837, and the orphanage is located at No. 101 Gongyi Wharf Street, Zhaojia Du, Nanshi."</p>
<h3>Newborn Production for Orphans</h3>
<p>A letter from Guan Jiong-zhi, Director of the Jingye Orphanage, states that the orphanage's crafts workshop has long been producing clothing, Western suits, rattan and bamboo crafts, wood and paint products, sofa repairs, rabbit breeding, and net weaving, with inexpensive and high-quality products. As Children's Day approaches, the orphanage, in order to expand its services to the community, has newly established a leather shoe workshop in addition to the existing workshops. The products are of high quality and the prices are especially low. At a time when prices are soaring, this move by the orphanage provides great convenience to general consumers. The orphanage is located inside Jueyuan at No. 400, the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Hardoon Road, telephone number 33781.</p>
<p>Claim for Lost Trousers: I, the undersigned, picked up a pair of Western-style trousers while shopping at the China Underwear Company on Nanjing Road on the 29th.

<h3>Retail Investors Scavenge, Raw Gold Rises Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash raw gold in the black market saw prices trending upward amid sparse transactions. Scattered retail investors were quite active in buying. There was an increasing number of customers in the gold jewelry shops (not subject to registration controls). These customers came to scavenge, causing the price to rise from 18,200 yuan in the morning to 18,600 yuan. It then retreated slightly to 18,450 yuan, due to a small sell-off by a certain securities firm. At 11:00 AM, it was 18,500 yuan, and at noon it rose again to 18,600-18,700 yuan. It is said that military tickets were also trending upward, up 400 yuan from the previous day's noon price. Starting today, the Tomb Sweeping Festival and Sunday together make a four-day holiday, and business will resume on the 7th (next Tuesday).</p>
<p>The price of gold jewelry per tael at Da Xin and other major gold shops remained at 1,950 yuan (200 yuan less for purchases). Standard silver was listed at 18 yuan. The black market had prices with no volume, around 14 yuan. Silver coins were about 8 yuan each.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Reduced by Five Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for "header" bills was reduced by five yuan per thousand, to fifteen yuan. The interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association remained unchanged at 7%.</p>
<h3>Military Tickets Increased Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw the British and American gold pounds remain stable, with the former still at 400 yuan and the latter still at 410 yuan. US dollar tickets were still 27-28 yuan, and Hong Kong tickets were also still 3.5 yuan, with large notes discounted by 10 cents. Military tickets rose as high as 7.75 yuan, and the final price was 7.7 yuan.</p>
<h3>Before Tomb Sweeping Holiday, Internal Debt Fully Settled</h3>
<p>The over-the-counter market for government bonds fell again yesterday, but sentiment was not weak. Because there is a holiday starting today, for a total of four days including Sunday, most speculators are unwilling to bear the unearned interest during this extended holiday and are eager to sell. However, there were also quite a few who were willing to buy, mainly due to tight credit. As a result, prices fell, and after the price fell, short sellers took advantage of the low prices to cover their positions. Initially, Tongli and Lianhe bought in, followed by Yongkang, Chengkang, Hu Heji, and Dadehao absorbing them. Class C bonds rose to 4.8 yuan. Later, Hongxinghao suddenly sold a large quantity, and Tongkanghao took the opportunity to cover their short positions. Lianxinghao absorbed Class B bonds in large volumes. Others such as Tongji, Shunli, Datong, Runde, Zhenhua (selling Class E), and Yuxing (selling Class A and B) also sold some. In short, the total transaction volume for the day was over 800,000 yuan, with most being short-covering transactions. Most new transactions were short selling, with a few being investments. Most people are holding the principle of trading again after the market reopens. As a result, prices fell by 4 to 9 cents across the board. The transaction volume was approximately 800,000 yuan. A brief summary table is listed below.</p>
<p>Starting today, there is a four-day holiday for Tomb Sweeping Festival including the weekend. Business will resume as usual on the 7th.</p>
<h3>Both Chinese and Western Stocks Had Sparse Trading</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign stocks were firm, but trading turned sparse, with a total of 5,400 shares traded. Jardine Spinning Mill had 500 shares, with the price rising to 26.5 yuan.

Ken Zhi had 1,000 shares, with the price at 26.75 and 27 yuan. The rest were also slightly firm, but no opening transactions were made.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks were flat and weak, and trading was also light. Wing On Company was at 44 yuan, and Sincere at 76 yuan, both down one yuan. China Underwear was 19.75 to 19.5 yuan.

<p>Eastern Cloth: Prices continued to rise sharply, reaching new highs. Dragon Head fine cloth new orders opened in the morning at 228 yuan, fell to 226.5 yuan, and then rose again to 235 yuan at noon. Although there was not much trading in the afternoon, the market atmosphere remained firm, reaching a high of 238 yuan. The closing price was 237.5 yuan, up another ten yuan from the previous day.

Four Gentlemen Serge for the April 10th-12th factory order was at 7.2 yuan, red order with new tax was at 6.93 yuan.</p>
<h3>Spot Yarn Has Stronger Rising Momentum</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market continued to rise, mainly due to the lack of spot goods, so the rising momentum was quite strong. The opening price for 20-count Shuangma factory orders was 3,650 yuan, briefly falling to 3,605 yuan. Hearing that the spot yarn market was good and buyers were coming one after another, the yarn market gradually moved forward, rising to 3,720 yuan. However, some profit-takers sold off, causing it to loosen again. The closing price, however, rose back to 3,700 yuan. 42-count Blue Phoenix was at 8,950 to 9,350 yuan, 42-count Xian Tao at 8,850 yuan, 42-count Yang He at 9,000 yuan, 32-count Blue Phoenix at 9,700 yuan, 60-count Bull Head at 18,500 yuan, 20-count Yue Qin at 4,600 to 4,850 yuan, 20-count Zheng Nian at 5,150 to 5,200 yuan, 20-count Shuang Ma at 4,150 to 4,400 yuan, 16-count Hong Kui Xing at 4,650 to 4,700 yuan, 18-count Zhi Nv at 4,530 yuan, 10-count Boy Scouts at 3,000 to 3,100 yuan, 10-count Red Shuang Ma at 3,100 to 3,200 yuan, 6-count Bumble Bee at 3,950 to 4,250 yuan, and 6-count Rouge Tiger at 4,300 yuan.</p>
<h3>Bean Cake Factory Orders - Some Speculative Trading - Bran Continues to Be Sold Inland</h3>
<p>Yesterday's trade in miscellaneous grains remained sluggish, mainly because transportation was still difficult, and people remained hesitant. Only bean cake warehouse orders saw some speculative activity, with prices rising by about one yuan. Other transactions were sparse and prices were mixed. Sales included ten bags of Sangyuan yellow soybeans, priced at 190 yuan; twenty-five bags of Taicang red beans, priced at 206 yuan; one hundred bags of Chongming sand silkworm chrysalis, priced at 146 yuan. 1000 pieces of Hankou bean cake were traded for 41 yuan, 500 pieces of Lizi bean cake new warehouse orders were traded for 55 yuan, and a carload of Feizi bean cake was traded for 54.4 yuan. 3000 pieces of Shenji bean cake new warehouse orders for May delivery were traded at 51 to 52 yuan, for new orders in April, it traded for 51.8 yuan, and for new warehouse orders it traded for 58 yuan.</p>
<p>Recently, inland dealers have been continuously shipping bran, so the off-site selling price has been trending upward. It is said that the inland purchase price for Sanxin bran is 115 yuan.</p>
<h3>Delivery Available - Cigarette Prices Loosen</h3>
<p>Cigarette prices continued to weaken. Because Yong Taihe, which previously handled various products from the Yuanchong Factory, continued to distribute goods to peers for sale, the number of wholesalers increased slightly, so prices and sales were sluggish. Sales included 50,000 Great British brand cigarettes at 12,000 yuan per case, Old Knife brand at 10,400 yuan, Little Fairy brand at 6,600 yuan, Five Flowers brand at 6,400 yuan, and Pinhai brand at 7,500 yuan. Japanese cigarettes followed the decline, with Golden Gun brand at 3,360 yuan, Golden Building brand at 3,450 yuan, Red Rose at 2,300 yuan, and Quanlu brand at 3,700 yuan.</p>
<h3>Prices of Daily Necessities Are High - Consumption Is Greatly Reduced</h3>
<p>The market for daily necessities is quiet. The selling prices of various goods have reached their peak, and consumption is bound to be reduced. Buyers are temporarily waiting and watching. Sales are sparse, and the market atmosphere is slightly sluggish. Prices include Beautiful brand matches at 7,100 yuan per case, Phoenix spleen at 6,900 yuan, miscellaneous brands at 5,900 yuan, Guban brand soap at 350 yuan per case, Bai Xiangmao soap at 320 yuan, Huang Xiangmao soap at 305 yuan, Scissor soap at 310 yuan, British candle at 200 yuan per case, and Monk Hat brand at 190 yuan.</p>
<h3>Candied Dates Gradually Rise</h3>
<p>Recently, candied dates have become scarce, and sugar prices have soared, so market prices have repeatedly risen. Initially, they rose from 650 yuan to 700 yuan, then to 750 yuan. The current market price has already reached 800 yuan. The usual additions and deductions are in place. The new crop season is still far away, so people generally hope to see prices reach 1,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Pepper Fluctuations Are Significant</h3>
<p>Black pepper supplies have been cut off and are also a target for hoarders. This commodity can be stored for a long time without spoiling, so speculative trading is very active. The price for No. 1 pepper once reached a peak of 1,500 yuan, then loosened and fell to 1,200 yuan. It has tightened again in recent days, and yesterday it was 1,350 yuan.</p>
<h3>Polished Rice Shortage</h3>
<p>Polished rice has not arrived for a long time, and market stocks are also very low. However, the hoarders still have a small amount of stock. Seeing that the inventory is short, they have high expectations. The price of Guan polished rice has increased by more than 100 yuan, and ordinary goods have also increased by tens of yuan. High-priced goods may reach 500 or 600 yuan in the future.</p>
<h3>Jackfruit (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>Moreover, its own reproductive capacity is also very astonishing: whether it is a "root sucker" that emerges from the underground root, or a "bud sucker" that emerges from the side of the leaf axil of the aerial stem, or a "small plant" that grows laterally below the fruit, or a "leaf crown" that grows densely above the fruit, all can be cut off from the mother plant for propagation; as for the "seeds" produced by the pulp, they can also germinate, grow, and even bear fruit, but it takes a little longer. Therefore, the places that now produce jackfruit, not to mention the various tropical countries of the Americas; Asia has India, the Indochina Peninsula, and the South Seas Islands; Africa has Guinea and the Congo River Basin; as for the islands in the Pacific Ocean, especially Hawaii, a paradise for tropical plants, and the Azores and Madeira Islands in the Atlantic Ocean, its traces can be seen everywhere; even in the flower rooms of temperate countries, it can also be cultivated.</p>
<p>Jackfruit usually only produces one fruit per plant, but its yield and the size of the fruit vary depending on the type. Moreover, its original appearance was only the size of an orange: its ability to be so large now is entirely the result of people improving its seeds. According to the type: Florida in the southeastern United States mostly cultivates the "Spanish species", which has a fruiting rate of 93%, and 60% to 70% of the fruit diameter can exceed 5 inches. This type of jackfruit has a length slightly shorter than its diameter, forming a flat appearance, turns bright red when ripe, is easy to store, and convenient for long-distance transportation, making it the most valuable commercially. In Central America, Cuba, Guyana, or the Hawaiian Islands, people prefer to cultivate the "Cayenne" species. This type of fruit is of better quality, yellow-green with a slight red tint, with a fruiting rate of 50% to 60%, and 95% of the fruits have a diameter exceeding 5 inches. In the British island of Jamaica and the American island of Puerto Rico in the West Indies, in Brazil, in South Africa, in southern Asia, and in the East Indies, in addition to the two types mentioned above, there is also a "Queen" species: its fruiting rate can be as high as 98%, or even 100%! All the jackfruit mentioned above can be transplanted in all seasons, flower in all seasons, and bear fruit in all seasons: cultivators can predict when it is most cost-effective to bring it to market and harvest it at that time. One more thing to add is that each jackfruit usually weighs 15 pounds, but some can weigh as much as 25 pounds.</p>
<p>After the jackfruit is picked, it must be allowed to "sweat" – evaporate moisture – for 24 hours, and then each one is wrapped in paper, packed in boxes for shipment; each box holds about eight or a little more, with corn husks lining the inside to prevent shaking. If it is for making canned goods, there are specially made machines to peel, core, cut...etc., I think it is unnecessary to describe the step-by-step procedure. As for the two major bases for manufacturing canned goods, they are Hawaii and Singapore, these two naval strongholds facing each other across the sea...! (The End)</p>

<h3>Discussing Profits with the Sub-Landlord</h3>
<p>— Weicheng</p>
<p>In the past (and it's only been in the last three to five years), the conflicts and disputes between sub-landlords and sub-tenants could be said to have exhausted all the possibilities. In a nutshell, sub-landlords had a scarce commodity and sub-tenants could not bear the burden. Between these two, there seemed to be a very long distance, always standing in opposition, going in opposite directions. Now, this distance on the surface seems to have not changed, but in reality, there is an invisible force that is pulling both sides closer. If everyone calms down and thinks about it, they will realize that these two are only a difference in units, not a difference in class.</p>
<p>Sub-landlords have a nickname called "house eaters," and we sub-tenants naturally understand. However, in the past, everyone was willing to squeeze into Shanghai, so they were naturally willing to be "eaten." Even if they felt wronged by being "eaten" and came into conflict and dispute, the result was also being forced to lower their heads. Now, most of the sub-tenants are friends holding a "chicken rib," having reached a point where it is tasteless to eat, and will soon be the first candidates in the team to receive free return-to-homeland certificates. No matter how big things are, when they reach their peak, they cannot get any bigger. Therefore, if there are still any conflicts and disputes between sub-landlords and sub-tenants now, it should be the last time. -- If the sub-tenant fails this last time, the sub-landlord will not be the winner either. But it is definitely not a matter of victory or defeat being indistinguishable, the obvious fact is that "the house is empty!" This is the "invisible force." This force can pull together the two sides that are going in opposite directions. Therefore, I want to talk to the sub-landlord about the issue of profits.</p>
<p>The International Settlement has stipulated that the profit of sub-landlords shall not exceed 20%, and even including "external expenses" shall not exceed 35% at most, and based on the contract before March 31 to avoid the "extraneous branches" of new and old legal tender. The day this regulation is implemented will also be the time of peace in the world. The sub-landlords mentioned in this article, of course, refer to those in "Binjiang South."</p>
<p>Taking the sub-landlord where I live as an example, his profit is about 250% to 300%, not counting their own housing. Compared with 35%, the sub-landlords of the International Settlement certainly have a sense of "looking south with their heads raised." But yesterday morning (April 1), the sub-landlord's new order came down, requiring payment in new currency. The reason is that property tax and water and electricity costs must be paid in new currency, so the rent must also be collected in new currency. This reason is the same as when the main landlord increased the rent for water and electricity, called "must earn if there is an increase." Moreover, people have the same intentions, and most of the sub-tenants in the French Concession have received this secret notice to increase the rent by 30%. This kind of new notice will naturally cause some disputes. I don't think this dispute will have the same result as before, right? This different result is also because there is an "invisible force" inside – but it is not pulling closer, but pulling further away. However, victory and defeat are clear.</p>
<p>In recent months, the two authorities have taken the same steps in matters such as security and food supply. The sub-landlords of "Binjiang South" should not think that they are "the only ones who are respected." This "invisible force" is pulling closer in a good way. On the other hand, its power exceeds resistance.</p>
<h3>Marriage Is Difficult</h3>
<p>— Shabai</p>
<p>The great French novelist Maupassant said that marriage is like buying a lottery ticket, and it is good if the number can be drawn.</p>
<p>Among tens of thousands of lottery tickets, the number that can be won is too small, so it can be seen that marriage is really not an easy thing. Even if we put aside the theory of marriage and focus on the practical problem - the economic difficulties, under today's standard of living, it is probably enough to cause trouble for a group of young people.</p>
<p>I saw an article in the Western newspaper about marriage expenses exceeding 8,000 yuan (referring to Westerners). In this warm, breezy, lazy weather, it may be called a "timely" article to cobble together a short article with numbers.</p>
<p>The article said that the first step in getting married, the woman must first have an engagement ring, of course, the bigger the diamond ring, the better. Considering the lover's consideration, a small diamond ring costs at least 1,500 yuan, and it cannot be cheaper.</p>
<p>Once the two are engaged, they often have to have tea, watch movies, dance, and go to restaurants. In short, it is another thing that costs money.</p>
<p>The wedding dress worn by the bride on the wedding day now costs at least 500 yuan to make a set. Five years ago, 100 yuan was enough.</p>
<p>The closer the wedding day, the more the groom's head hurts. The gold wedding ring costs at least 250 yuan to 300 yuan. The wedding dress he wears costs 45 yuan to rent once. Five years ago, the rental fee was only 10 yuan, and it cost no more than about 100 yuan to make a new set. Now it is impossible to do without 500 yuan to 1,000 yuan. Borrowing a church for marriage costs another 100 yuan for the pastor's fees. The costs of flowers, singing, and piano players are extra. Even if it is a small family, the first month's rent, paid in advance, is at least 500 yuan. The house cannot be left completely empty. Furniture that is used must be bought. The bride prefers a set of chestnut wood bedroom furniture, which costs 3,000 yuan, a set of dining room utensils costs about 800 yuan, and a set of three-piece sofas costs 2,000 yuan. The total is 5,800 yuan, which disappears again.</p>
<p>Cutlery, spoons, basins, and plates are all thanks to the light of relatives and friends, who provided them in abundance, without costing a penny. However, carpets, curtains, tea sets, tablecloths, hanging lamps, and radios must be paid for out of pocket. There is also the salary of kitchen servants, etc., which must be paid one month in advance.</p>
<p>Okay, adding up all the things before and after, the total has exceeded the 8,000 yuan mark. It's better to be single!</p>
<h3>Catch Bedbug Eggs First</h3>
<p>— Xin Lv</p>
<p>Last night, probably because the weather was a little warmer, the hibernating bedbugs moved around, biting me awake from a good dream, and I had a sleepless night. I was extremely angry, and then I decided to get rid of it.</p>
<p>In the early morning, when it was still dimly lit, I put on my clothes and got out of bed, boiled a pot of boiling water, took the bed board apart, took it to the drying platform, poured it around, and found many white transparent oval bedbug eggs in the cracks in the board.</p>
<p>I thought that if all these eggs hatched, they would breed and spread, and it would be difficult to get rid of them. Fortunately, I found out early.</p>
<p>I remember someone once asked Mr. Wu Zhihui what the secret was to get rid of bedbugs. The gentleman did not answer directly, but gave that person a letter and ordered him to open it after returning home. It turned out that there were only two large characters "Catch diligently" on the entire stationery, without any secret recipe.</p>
<p>Catching diligently is indeed the only effective method to get rid of bedbugs, but it is not easy to completely eliminate them. It is better to put them to death before they are born. It is easy and effortless, and it can also eliminate them all at once, so that you will not be harassed by them on hot summer nights again.</p>
<p>Bedbug, also known as lazy bug. The meaning of this name is for everyone to experience for themselves.</p>
<h3>"It's Better to Give Birth to a Pig Than a Child"</h3>
<p>— A Rooster</p>
<p>In a chance encounter, I saw a middle-aged man sitting by the sidewalk with a child. The child's old-fashioned felt hat had a straw marker stuck in it. The "straw marker" signified that it was for sale. What was being sold was certainly not that old-fashioned felt hat, but the child wearing the felt hat. I did not want to buy a child, and I dared not ask how much the child was being sold for, because I couldn't bear to ask the price of a "human," the "spirit of all things," as if he were livestock. I stood silently to the side, hoping that a "superhuman" who could endure what others could not would come forward to ask the price, or even buy the child. I could listen from the sidelines and learn the "market price" of a "human," the "spirit of all things."</p>
<p>A young couple, arm in arm, walked past with hurried steps, their eyes and mouths constantly engaged in conversation. They paid no attention whatsoever to the "spirit of all things" being sold by the roadside. A middle-aged gentleman, balding and dressed in Western attire, walked by, a Luzon cigar in his mouth and a cane in his hand. He glanced at the head with the "straw marker" with a disdainful look and casually flicked the cigar butt to the side of the road; this kind of waste, like the cigar butt, was just waste. A kind-faced, vegetarian old lady, holding Buddhist prayer beads, perhaps reciting a section of the Diamond Sutra, looked at the "straw marker" with surprise and quickly quickened her pace, chanting scriptures as she walked by; this was retribution for sins in a previous life, she was now reaping the consequences. The old lady had a moment of great realization and would go home to offer more sacrifices before the Buddha. Two young children returning home from school stared curiously at the "straw marker." They did not understand the meaning of the "straw marker." They stood for a while, slowly took a few steps backward, and then ran away as fast as they could, laughing as they ran, perhaps thinking that sticking a "straw marker" on a hat was a laughable thing.</p>
<p>It is said that a fat pig can be exchanged for thousands of French francs. A cigar butt can cause two bums to fight. But, but a "human," the "spirit of all things," a person with complete features and limbs, is waiting to be sold with a straw marker, and no one even asks. I don't know if this situation has "always been this way"? But seeing that every passerby has no pity or sympathy for their kind being sold, one cannot help but feel that it is "more intense now"!</p>
<p>I left in a daze. I thought that if Du Fu were alive today, he would certainly sing loudly, "It's better to give birth to a pig than a child!"</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat in Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(Two) Sorrow and Joy</p>
<p>Li Youxie first said that the dead cannot be brought back to life, and then talked about how alone the Ye family was, and then mentioned Qin Runzhi's words. Before Wei Cheng finished listening, he shook his head. As he shook his head, he felt a headache. He didn't hear many of the words. Madam Ye Er said, "Child, I am not helping your uncle to persuade you, what your uncle said is a flexible approach. I think it is a temporary solution. Now, good or bad, it is all in your mouth. If you say it's good, we will start with the wedding. The room I live in will be vacated immediately for you to use as a bridal chamber." Wei Cheng stared blankly at Madam Ye Er, Great Aunt Li Youxie, looking at each face, not saying anything. Great Aunt thought that Wei Cheng was considering, and helped Madam Ye Er to say a few words. Li Youxie said with a smile, "We will deal with everything externally. You don't need to say a word. Of course, whether it is me, Li Youxie, acting as Wei Cheng, or Second Sister-in-law, Great Aunt, acting as Wei Cheng, no one can say that after such a great tragedy, while the body is still cold, one would want to arrange a good marriage first. You don't need to worry about this. We will announce it to your relatives and friends, and we can also expect that each and every one of them will advise you." The three elders forced a smile onto Wei Cheng's face covered in frost. But this smile was like a flash in the pan. When it appeared, he said, "I really don't understand why I was born a person and read some books." These were just two cold sentences, and there was no more to say. Madam Ye Er was the first to understand, and smiled along with him, "Uncle, let's not talk about this. Wei Cheng, he doesn't want to. Isn't he saying that a person cannot do this, and reading books cannot do this? Originally, Miss Wei has never been seen, whether she is thin or fat, whether she is virtuous or naughty. The matchmaker's temper is that nine out of ten lie, so it is no wonder that Wei Cheng is unwilling. I said that the wedding should be held, and this marriage should fall on Sister Cuizhen." Wei Cheng showed a smile, like a flash in the pan, and said, "Sister Cuizhen." Great Aunt thought this was an opportunity to interject, and quickly said:</p>
<p>"Sister Cuizhen is your best friend. The fortune teller has calculated her fate. She will suffer hardships when she is young, but she will have a husband-assisting luck when she grows up. Yes, this is much better than the girl from the Wei family. I guess Wei Cheng will never rebut this." (40)</p>
<h3>A Child's Sleeping Face</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yufen</p>
<p>Some people say that a child's sleeping face is pure and lovely.</p>
<p>I once thought so and gazed at him. But now, I don't think so. Late at night, awake alone, gazing at the sleeping child, the more I gaze, the more desolate my heart becomes. His cheeks are a healthy and bloody red; his skin has no wrinkles etched by worry. But behind that unknowingly sublime face, isn't there a terrifying dark fate, coldly and maliciously spying?</p>
<p>How will a child live and how will he die? No one can know these things. And people, because of mutual hatred, are inadvertently arranging a world that is difficult for a child to live in.</p>
<p>The unknowable fate has placed such a heavy burden on the child's shoulders. Isn't this already enough? And can't people, because of their mutual hatred, throw even more unbearable burdens to that child? (No payment accepted)</p>
<h3>A Thousand Difficulties, Ten Thousand Hardships</h3>
<p>— Wen Zhen</p>
<p>I don't know how much effort it took to earn a few banknotes.</p>
<p>I don't know how much strength it took to squeeze out a liter of foreign rice.</p>
<p>I don't know how much I walked to buy a few coal balls.</p>
<p>Only then can I have a meal to eat.</p>
