<p>至於冰島，自從英人讓美軍接管以後，大下一震；其時上海一隅的英人，聽到這個消息，臉上先是泛上一陣白，頃刻轉紅，繼而嘴角上掛出一點會心的微笑；因爲他們立刻可以想到，這突如其來的消息後面，是一篇什麽文章。要是不懂得美軍因何接防冰島，更不懂得美軍因何調駐愛爾蘭了。</p>
<p>再說紐芬蘭，在軍事家的眼光中，可說是西半球的交通孔道，自從大戰揭幕以來，這島上的首　聖約翰，由一個　無聲息的小埠，一變而爲世界最鬧忙的碼頭；凡自美國及坎拿大運往英國的資源人物，都山此地出發。同時因爲這島上的湖港交織，最適於建築水陸飛機根據地；而隱蔽着的海港也很多，所以美國在這裏築有極大的機塲和軍港。我們千萬不能小看這四萬多方里的一隻海島，　是英美溝通的一柄</p>
<p>說了這些，也可知道美人忙到了甚麽程度，然而還不足以說明　位角色化裝何以如此之慢　請再從大西洋　　置上，掉轉眼光來看看她國內的情　，就知道她正式登塲，也許　得相當的時日哩。要解釋這一萬，我們就要從三部曲的第　渡過到第二　來。</p>
<p>這第二　曲究是些什麽　人：有些什麽材料　給我們作爲小說的情節？限於篇幅，我們祗能粗枝大葉的點一些</p>
<p>過去，美國孤立派的孤立政策，鬧得烏烟瘴氣，是我們都知道的。其後在一般要人的言談中，不大提起這事，我們總認爲孤立派已經軟化，而放下其孤立的政策了。殊不知自從雜斯福第三期常選以來，迄今爲止，在美國的政黨中，明爭暗鬥，不知耗了幾許精神，費了幾許週轉，始終不曾廊淸這孤立之說。旣有這孤立的主張，羅氏的許多計劃，當然要碰上些軟硬釘子：雖說沒有百分之百的掣肘，一件事情的進行，也就不免要遷延時日，而且要弄得七折八扣的不澈底。根據四月二十三日華盛頓電，美國國務卿宜稱共和黨議決放棄孤立主　之說，可知美人的「千呼萬喚，不肯出來」，究竟是個甚麼毛病。</p>
<p>其次還有一個糾纒不淸的麻煩　伙　對於美人進行事務，曾經　　不　的　礙，那就是希特勒的拿手傑作第五縱隊。讀者如不健忘的話，前不多時羅斯福還對許多要人，大放噱頭，說他們這羣人中，就有被敵人利用着作不利具的。關於這一點，美人也拿也了看家的本領，努力的大　肅淸。工廠的搗亂，有軍隊彈壓；秘密工作，有臉炙人口的G-Men去消滅。不僅國內如此，連南美各國，也有美人從中幫忙掃除一切的老五工作。秘魯和厄瓜多爾，去歲七月不是鬧過一齣全武行麽？那正是希氏老五的傑搆；可是不到三星期，就烟消火滅，大家都認爲是阿根廷出面料理的，不知美人正在阿國的幕後撐腰哩。</p>
<p>放野火的多，救火的工作也敏速異常，可是進行事務上，終久是要受些影響，囚着這種影響，那佈置的日程，多少也要延宕一些。好在美人辦事，講究爽快，許多大事都在那裏追風逐電般的進展不巳。這些大事之中，我們目提出幾件說說。</p>
<p>春財政上，本來用不着任何人簪美人担心事，誰不知道美國的富裕？就去崴的稅收報吿，美人預期每天稅收三百萬金元的標準，早巳達到，近來雖說消息不靈，但從國防概算上，推想起來，恐怕已有加倍的進步咧。從一件小事上，也可證實這一點：從去歲八月來，美國　行過一種國防儲蓄郵票，山全國商店總會擔任分銷。在九月裏，全國大小一百八十萬個商店，山四白六十萬個商店職員，正式實行向他們的八千萬日常老中顧推銷。我們搬指算一算，這件小玩意每天的收入是多少？然而這父與吸取民脂民膏，不管人死活的辦法，不可同日而語：因爲每分郵票，都是一點返本還利的儲蓄；財界的主持人說過，他們固然是要多籌國防的經費，但同時也要替人們打算戰後的經濟復興，和市面的繁榮哩。</p>
<p>關於海陸空軍的徵員事務，有關軍事，不宜多說。我們只知道美國的空軍，現下與坎拿大的空軍學校，進行得頗如人意。</p>
<p>對於軍人的鼓勵，美人的口號是「全國男女公民。即是軍隊幕後的軍隊」。全國各城鎭都有軍民聯歡的廣大組織。在聯歡會裏，當地的女子都自動出席組織音樂，戲劇，等等團體，為國家效勞。</p>
<p>至於太太們，也都全體動員。有在多喜歡出風頭的太太們，她們都致「投針從戎，向陸，空，事務所要求登記。可是當局勸導她們回到廚房裏去：因爲美國的人力頗有裕，政府正需要她們在本位上努力；那就是說，要她們儘量掙節日用，多購國防儲　。</p>

<p>— 覺潛</p>
<p>吃過晚飯，我抱着一間來無事　馬路、的經濟（根本不要馬路錢）消遣力法，我又在廣坦到馬路上一個子措手的踱着。</p>
<p>走着，走着，沿漢口路朝東走着；穩健的步伐，假使大地罩上一層厚雪，眞可留下一個個整齊有數的足印。我的頭低着，腦海裏在默默的沉思，在思索着——我的過去，現在，將來，……</p>
<p>一陣使人凜凜的寒風；呼啦的從我身旁括過；我抬頭一看，原來橫在我眼前的已是一條遼闊的黃浦江。</p>
<p>我倚着黃浦江旁的鐵欄，開始向江的對岸，江的左右，亳無目標的憑眺。——</p>
<p>黃浦江上風平浪靜，稀若晨星的舟燈點點的散佈在江面上；點綴成一片晶晶耀目的美景。向來閙熱的黃沛碼頭，現在却「鐵將軍把門」；偶有一二個碼頭開放着，擠軋在兩旁的都是挑着行李，携着包裏的男女；無疑的他們或她們是在生活鞭的驅策下，是實行「歸鄉運動」的一羣。囉嘈的嘩閙聲，它代替了以前的小工和脚夫的搬運貨物時的叫喊聲。</p>
<p>矗立在江海關前的赫德銅像，在黯淡的電燈光下，還可看出牠的身上已披上了一件綠色的外衣；由此可證明牠已經經歷勒幾十年的風雨。他措着手，府着首，好像在沉思什麼似的；但是，我到底猜測不出牠在思索些什麼！——還是在爲着海關前途而愁悶呢？還是在計劃着海關未來的新生命？還是……</p>
<p>總之，這位海關功臣的赫德，在現在，他再也無能來打破這海關史上的空前寂寞；及開闢孤島與外界的新的交通航綫！</p>
<p>江海關的大自鳴鐘，噹…噹…的敲了九下；我對矗立着的赫德銅像，投了最後的一眼，才揹手踱步的返家。</p>

<p>本稿係勃朗氏所作，原文刊載於英文上海大美晚報，內分十一節，叙寫十二、八以來工部局爲應付非常事變而設之組織系統之內部情形及工作，極明晰正確。茲請張蔭槐先生將其全文逐節摘譯，俾世人對工部局現今之組織，獲相當認識，殆亦讀者所樂睹歟？編者</p>
<p>一、智囊團</p>
<p>每週每晨的同一時刻，在工部局行政大厦某條走廊盡頭的一間室內，有一個特別會議在舉行着。每晨十時，八個男人與一位姣小幹練的女速記員魚貫而入這個寬廣的房間，嚴肅地密議着一切影響久遠的方針。外界對這個特別委員會知道得很少，更絕不知道它的責任之重，活動範圍之廣。假使一旦明瞭，不知會怎樣的驚奇哩！</p>
<p>無論我們是在什麽地方，總有一個命遝，在刻劃出我們的前途。在上海，便是道個特殊的委員會。當這八個人每晨坐下舉行日常討論時，公共租界境內的上海居民的生活便或此或彼地受到了影饗。因爲這個委員會是一個繁複組織的神經中樞。它是一個巨大統制網的管理中心，這網的觸絲向外仲展，困圍住無量數的瑣碎事物，殲滅掉無量數的罪惡淵藪。它是一架龐大而走勢平衡的機器的頭腦，統一目標，指示工作。它的名稱便是綜合委員會。</p>
<p>笑駡由他笑駡</p>
<p>在遙遠的已成過去的另一個時代裹，大衆都以笑駡工部局爲慣常的消遣。每個人都這樣。甚至一家力量薄弱得不足以損害它的報館也加入了這行列。新聞記者架之以油墨。無綫電播音家在空氣中放射着看不見的冷箭。漫畫家的筆尖上飽浸了毒汗。</p>
<p>但是言駡也常有用。工部局也許會說「由你隨心所欲地毒駡吧；與其說是傷害，它倒常是一種恩惠呢。」去年十二月，我們在這城市裏看到了這樣一個徹底的變動，什麽都因此震脫了常軌。却不道便是在這困苦艱厄的情形下，工部局聳越於混亂紛紜的批評之上，昭示於滿腹疑雲的民衆：它實在是爲大衆福利而戰鬥的一柄有力武器。</p>
<p>當時，工部局跟每個人一樣，被擲進了手足無措的混亂世界中，一個有着一速串的問題而父並無以往經騐與知識足以憑藉的世界中。明顯地，這是一僩需要緊急措置的時際。應運而生的是幾個緊急組織與委員會，以應付各項事務。但是在這些上面，還需要一個能將包羅萬有的問題作整個硏究並調整其他各部的工作使趨一統的機構。這機構便是綜合委員會。</p>
<p>第一條鐵律</p>
<p>蒲柏（繙譯荷馬的大詩人）曾說，秩序是天堂的第一條鐵律。其中便含着「一個能容萬物而萬物各得其所的所在」之意。秩序是思想淸明之所賴，身體健康夕所賴，也便是都市和平之所賴。天地、星球以至這個國際中心、在各種程序中都應有其先後、地位和程度的差異。萬物都是被千古不易的法則所規定的；萬物都是注定了的：萬物都是前因之果：這些都無庸有了荷馬或法利賽派哲人才能相信。什麼地方有了隻控制的掌腕了。十分之九，準是那個綜台委員會。</p>
<p>日常工作</p>
<p>每天上午十時，綜合委員會齊集了硏究當天的各種不同的問題。這些會議約長一二小時，在此過程中，這八個委員討論着緊急措置的各部分和各委員會所送來的間題。這些每天放在他們面前的問題並無限制。試閱名單，便可見有如下各種不同的性質：米，運輸管理·煤·麵粉·難民·汽車使用許可·肥皂·汽油·財政·糖·香烟·植物油·房租·貨幣·一般物價統制·限價執行等等以及共他一切無窮盡的問題。只有天空——或者，正確點說，上海及其中一切——才是它的界限。</p>
<p>我們且從「問題」上輾過來，看看解決。問題」的人。八個都是具有驚人能力與沉重的責任心的人。首席是上海工部局總董，其次是兩位該局董事。此外有工部局總辦，財務處處長，警務處代表與該委員會秘書。委員的名單如次：岡崎勝男（總董）馮德克龍葛樂泰寺岡洪本（總辦）毛傑（財務處長）鄧肯（警務處代表）畢思禮（秘書）後宮虎郞（總董之私人幫辦）</p>
<p>一個優良的官長須具備五種特性：才能，簡練的手腕，敏捷的決斷，忍耐與公正。這八個人全有。</p>

<p>— 鎭</p>
<p>好久看不見梅蘭芳，海上整萬的梅迷，是如何的渴望着，望梅可以止渴，那末如今李世芳的到來，也可以使梅迷過過癮解解渴哩。李世芳這回擁着小梅蘭芳的榮譽，帶着王二片的胡琴，名琴票倪秋萍君的二胡，蒞滬作處女的獻演，天天排唱舞台上已好久不見的大批梅劇，洛神，西施，生死恨，鳳還巢……，成績雖不能與梅蘭芳相提並論，在後起之秀梅派靑衣中，個還祗有一十二歲的靑年伶人，也可算是難能的了。</p>
<p>星期六的下午，和攝影專家康君訪世芳於其寓所，相見之下，舞台上不必說，其「私底下」，容貌以至談笑舉止，眞與梅蘭芳大同而小異。同時我們也會見了後起的名凈袁世海，攝影之後，就隨便談談，先提到別姬舞劍之美，袁世海稱此戲他們倆確有若干心得，霸王學的完全是楊派，虞姬學的當然完全是梅蘭芳，普通由凈飾霸王，都是僅僅表演一股的英勇，而缺乏悲壯的成份，他們倆在這一點上，自信尙有可覜的表演。談到了劇本，李世芳吿訴我們，除了梅派戲之外，金瓶女紅綃是尙少雲的戲改編的，將要露演的百花公主，與程硯秋的女兒心同一故事，而編製不同，問起了戲劇專家捧梅的齊如山敎授，世芳說他老先生如今不知　跡何處，有人說在香港，在上海，在北方，可是都沒有，或許往內地去了。</p>
<p>我們父談到南北生活的髙貴，世芳說照目下南北滙款的困難，幣制滙水的髙漲，（聯準券現値滬幣五元餘）將來北方伶人的南來，在報酬包銀方面，將很感困難，馬連良在北方售聯準券三元，已經要滬幣十七元了，普通角兒在北方都是二元左右，合起來也很可觀，娛樂究非必需，太貴售座也有影響，如果再加捐稅，馬連良在上海就非賣二十餘元不可，在馬本人所得也極平常，這倒是眞話。</p>
<p>北方的生活，他說一席酒需聯券一百五十元，許多東西買不到，行頭南北價相仿，倒還是南方的料子好，所以想將來買點東西，衣服，行頭回去，這也可見北方生活的一斑。</p>
<p>最後他說：我吿訴你一僩好消息，老師梅先生準在月底之前，搭飛機北返，許多朋友幫忙，一切都已準備好了，太眞外傳就是等他來了再唱，梅老師還要替他把塲哩，這確是梅迷的一個好消息。</p>

<p>（五）拔來報往</p>
<p>這天晚上，維城一個人坐在雙梅書屋燈下，想着明天，大姑母二姑母都該來了。嘴裏啣了一枝香烟，望着他父親的遺象出神。忽然門外有脚　走來，他沒聽出是誰來了，還是昂了頭不作一聲。誰知走進來的是翠珍，她提着輕快的步子，站到維城旁邊，維城一回頭，說道：「翠珍姊，白天辛苦，晚上該早一些睡。」說時就聞到了翠珍身上一陣淸香的胰子氣息。翠珍道：「我們年輕，睡得遲）些，也沒關係。城弟不知道，我來到這裏，天天比城弟睡得遲，昨天晚上，城弟從這邊回到房裏，自鳴鐘　噹噹的打三下，是三點鐘了。」維城道：「哎喲，道不對。」翠珍道：「大伯母去世了，二伯母身體也不見怎樣健，裏邊的喜鵲，外邊的阿興，他們都一倒頭就打呼，不管城弟的事了。二伯母會經說過一句，我不能比城弟早睡呀！」</p>
<p>維城望了望翠珍的兩隻大眼睛，從心裏感激出來，說道：翠珍姊，你怎麽不坐，我忙了說話，自已倒是大刺刺的坐着。」翠珍拉了一把靠近脚邊的椅子坐下，笑道：「陳小姐送了禮來嗎？」維城道：還沒有。翠珍道：「黃龍呢？」維城把個烟蒂，投在痰盂裏，沒投着，翠珍忙去把烟蒂檢起來，投在痰盂裏，又問道：「黃龍呢？維城道：「黃龍已是送了一筆很厚的禮了。翠珍坐下又問道：「我舅舅送了禮吧？」維成道：「納我道不希望他送禮，我也沒有把　聞發給他。衛　卿送了禮來，是一個紙幛，一副紙對，不知從那裏去抄襲來的現成聯話，幛子上寫福壽全歸四個字。偏是一竅不通的人偏是喜歡掉文，這眞是沒法奈何他們。」翠珍道：「幛子對子，要很多的錢吧？維城道：「要不了多少錢。翠珍掠了掠額上的鬋髮，微笑道：「城弟，我有一句話開不出口。」說着她又笑了。（七三）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Adapting to the Current Environment in India: Britain Adjusts Defense Organization; Three Route Armies Separately Command; Japanese Planes Bomb Assam British Positions <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 11th (Allied News Agency telegraph) According to dispatches from New Delhi, in order to strengthen India's defense, the British military authorities in India have decided to adjust the defense organization. The methods are as follows:</p>
<p>The original Northern, Eastern, and Southern three administrative regions will be renamed the Northwest Army, the Eastern Army, and the Western Army.</p>
<p>The original military administrative regions were based on administrative divisions. They are now reorganized into combat-centered units in order to deal with emergencies.</p>
<p>The Northwest Army is responsible for the defense of the Northwest frontier, the Southern Army is responsible for the defense of the Indian peninsula, and the Eastern Army is responsible for the defense of the northeast region of Bengal (including Assam).</p>
<p>The defense of central India, formerly centered in New Delhi and jointly shared by the three military administrative regions, will henceforth be the responsibility of a single army. An independent Central Command will be newly established, which will be responsible for the education of troops to meet the needs of future troop expansion.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 12th (Reuters) The three military commands in northern, eastern, and southern India have been changed from fixed administrative bases to operational commands, ready to act and strike in any direction. A military spokesman in New Delhi formally announced this matter yesterday, saying that this change was carried out in close cooperation with the Air Force and the Indian Navy. The aforementioned commands have been renamed the Northwest Route Army, the East Route Army, and the South Route Army. The Northwest Route Army is responsible for defending the western entrances of India, the South Route Army is responsible for defending the Indian peninsula, and the East Route Army is responsible for the northeast land border, including the provinces of Bengal and Assam. Some areas in central India, such as New Delhi, which were formerly under the jurisdiction of various commands, have now been merged into a separately established Central Command to take over the administrative responsibilities of the operational commands.</p>
<p>Saigon, 12th (Allied News Agency telegraph) According to a dispatch from the Allied Press Agency in New Delhi, the British Indian Army Command announced that Japanese air forces bombed British positions in the eastern part of Assam province, on the border between India and Burma, at 10:25 am on the 11th.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 11th (Allied News Agency telegraph from New Delhi) The British authorities announced on the 11th that Japanese air units had attacked Imphal (Assam Province, India), 350 kilometers northeast of Chittagong.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 12th (Haitong News Agency telegraph) According to London, a committee composed of British air force experts, including four men and two women, is now en route to Calcutta to organize an air defense system for the Indian people.</p>
<p>Australia Faces New Crisis; Defense Needs Improvement Urgently</p>
<p>Melbourne, 12th (Havas Agency telegraph) Australian Federal Army Minister Ford recently stated that although Australia's national defense organization has made progress, it is not yet fully on a wartime footing. The people of the country should concentrate all their efforts to accelerate the production of aircraft and ordnance, as a new crisis may occur.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 11th (Haitong News Agency telegraph) From the minutes of yesterday's Australian cabinet meeting, it can be seen that the battle in the Coral Sea has had pessimistic consequences. According to news from the British side, Australia's defenses have been greatly improved in the past two months, but they are still insufficient. It is still necessary to intensify the import of large quantities of aircraft and munitions to cope with the new crisis.</p>

<p>Maroco, Mindanao Province, 11th (Allied News Agency telegraph) After the surrender of Major General Sharp, commander of the US forces on Mindanao and Visayas Islands, was accepted by the Japanese army on the night of the 10th, Major General Sharp immediately issued an order to disarm the US and Filipino troops on Mindanao Island and ordered his subordinates to gather at a designated location. Major General Sharp and the Japanese general then met in this village in the northern part of Mindanao Island to discuss the surrender in just 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Haitong News Agency telegraph) According to the "Asahi Shimbun," US Commander-in-Chief General Sharp has ordered the unconditional surrender of approximately 20,000 US troops on Mindanao and the Visayas Islands. The Visayas Islands include Cebu, Panay, Negros, and Bohol. The Philippine battles have now been declared over, and the US military will now disarm at designated locations.</p>
<p>Melbourne, 12th (Reuters) General MacArthur's headquarters today issued a communiqué mentioning Japanese aircraft attacking Port Moresby (New Guinea) and Horn Island.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Burma War Situation <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Somewhere in Burma, 11th (Allied News Agency telegraph) The Japanese army completely cleared out the remnants on the banks of the Nu River, and at the same time swept through the Bhamo area. More than 100 Indian soldiers lurking in the nearby mountains surrendered to the Japanese army. The Chongqing army in civilian clothes who infiltrated Bhamo have been completely rounded up by the Japanese army, and Bhamo is now in a peaceful situation. Another unit of the Japanese army continued to advance downstream along the Irrawaddy River from Bhamo to continue the sweep.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Japanese Army Controls Burma; India's Oil Source Cut Off; In the Future, It Can Only Rely on the Near East <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Rome, 11th (Havas Agency telegraph) Military figures here recently stated that after the Japanese army advanced steadily in Burma, India's main source of oil has been cut off. In the future, India's gasoline needs must rely on oil wells in Iran and Iraq. In other words, the land route for the transportation of this gasoline must be 2,000 miles, and the sea route must be more than 4,000 miles. At the same time, the Allied countries must send a large number of oil tankers to travel back and forth on the Persian Gulf and Indian seas. However, it is well known that these countries lack oil tankers, and land transportation is difficult due to a lack of vehicles. Under these circumstances, the British attempt to win a victory on the North African Cyrenaica front in order to have more freedom of action in the Mediterranean and thus facilitate its communications with India and the Near East is not impossible.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Japanese Cabinet Approves Shipbuilding Plan <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Haitong News Agency telegraph) This morning, the Japanese Cabinet approved the plan proposed by the Planning Institute to increase the construction of merchant ships. In the future, merchant ships produced under government supervision must be sold at low prices. The plan stipulates that the selling price of merchant ships must be lower than the construction cost, and the government will compensate for the loss. The above plan will be submitted to parliament for discussion on the 27th of this month.</p>

<p>Bangkok, 12th (Haitong News Agency telegraph) The Thai government has called up young people who have not yet received training in the past to undergo six months of training. Conscription bureaus have been established in Bangkok and the province. This training for young people includes both military and spiritual education. After the training is completed, they will be incorporated into the supplementary army.</p>

<p>Chongqing, 12th Telegraph: The Twelfth Order:</p>
<p>Tang Yi, a member of the Relief and Rehabilitation Committee, is knowledgeable and talented. He was registered in the Alliance in his early years and devoted himself to the revolution. After the restoration, he suffered many misfortunes and upheld justice. He has made many contributions throughout his career. In recent years, he has devoted himself to relief work, helping the people and protecting the innocent, and his merits have become more and more prominent. Now that I hear of his passing away due to his worries about the times, I am deeply saddened. He should be publicly commended and given 5,000 yuan for funeral expenses. The Examination Yuan should be instructed to transfer the Ministry of Personnel to discuss compensation in a preferential manner, and his life's deeds should be kept on file and announced to the Historical Records Office to show the government's deep concern for veterans. This order, Reverend William MacDonald, an American missionary, is pure and sincere in nature and embraces love. He was engaged in charitable work in Chongqing in the past and has a long-standing reputation. After the war broke out, he returned from the United States to Sichuan and volunteered for rescue work during air raids. His righteous deeds and benevolent spirit are worthy of praise. Now that I hear of his death from overwork, I am deeply saddened. He should be publicly commended in order to demonstrate his outstanding conduct. This order.</p>

<h3 id="e12">Martinique Island Issue Expected to Be Resolved Peacefully; French Ambassador Calls on Hull for Long Talk <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>New York, 12th (Reuters) According to information from the French side, High Commissioner Robert of Martinique Island will telegraph to US Caribbean Sea Front Commander, Admiral Hoover, that the talks are proceeding satisfactorily. It is reported that the central issues under discussion are: the repatriation of French warships, the transfer of seven oil tankers and several cargo ships to the Allied countries, and the repatriation of 3,000 French sailors.</p>
<p>Washington, 11th (Havas Agency telegraph)</p>
<p>French Ambassador to the United States, Mr. Henry, visited the State Department today and held a lengthy discussion with Secretary of State Hull on the Martinique Island issue. Prior to this, Ambassador Henry told reporters, "Adding fuel to the fire is not the time now. The sooner the flames are extinguished, the better. The urgent task is to be patient first. We must avoid all disputes and restrain all criticisms so that we can obtain a smooth solution to a delicate issue 'without hindrance'." The ambassador then said when leaving the State Department that the negotiations currently underway on Martinique Island are expected to be resolved satisfactorily. The two men talked for more than an hour, with a break of several minutes in between so that Secretary of State Hull could receive those who recognized him as usual. When a reporter asked whether the US government had consulted with representatives of other American republics before sending Lieutenant General Hoover to Martinique Island to request guarantees from the French West Indies that they would not be used by the Axis powers, Hull replied that the current negotiations were not yet mature and that it was not necessary to consult with other American countries in accordance with the Havana Agreement for the time being?</p>
<p>The United States Adopts a Prudent and Thorough Attitude</p>
<p>Washington, 11th (Havas Agency telegraph) The United States and France are currently holding negotiations on the Martinique Island issue. Both sides are keeping silent and adopting a prudent attitude. However, public opinion here generally expresses optimism. According to various indications, both sides have expressed goodwill to each other in the negotiations, and it is not difficult for the negotiations to make progress. What is now hoped is that this issue can be properly resolved while taking into account the interests of both parties without resorting to force. The official attitude here can be described as the most prudent and thorough. Last night, the radio station issued a public statement warning the public to be wary of propaganda with ulterior motives and groundless judgments, and said that the demands made by US representative Lieutenant General Hoover to High Commissioner Robert of Martinique Island were not incompatible with French honor. The purpose of the United States is only to strengthen some of the guarantees previously given to France and to prevent the French West Indies from being used by a third country as a base for attacking the Western Hemisphere. Although this assumption is purely theoretical, the United States, as a belligerent country, must bear special obligations within the Pan-American framework.</p>
<p>Vichy Awaits Detailed Information</p>
<p>Vichy, 11th (Havas Agency telegraph) There was no new development regarding the Martinique issue today. According to the general impression, Chief Laval will be able to explain France's attitude to the outside world after receiving detailed information from Washington within a few days. Secretary of State Hull was still visited by French Ambassador to the United States, Mr. Henry, today to discuss the matter. The initial contact in this regard was made by US representative Lieutenant General Hoover, who personally visited the capital of Martinique Island to meet with Lieutenant General Robert. Afterwards, he transferred to San Juan, Puerto Rico, and telegraphed the results of the initial talks to the government authorities. Martinique Island is a first-class naval base, no different from Madagascar Island. In terms of its geographical location, the island is one of the largest islands in the French West Indies, with a large bay, and giant ships can reach the island's capital directly. The port of anchorage is very safe. There are currently three French warships stationed in the port, namely the aircraft carrier "Bearn" (displacement of 22,146 tons), the cruiser "Belleau," and the auxiliary cruiser "Barfleur." These three warships are all intact and form a fleet led by Lieutenant General Robert. In addition to this, it also has a large number of reserve air forces, including more than 200 American-made aircraft, which were shipped from the United States in June 1940. These aircraft are all on the island's airfield. Since the signing of the armistice agreement, Martinique Island has been the oldest French colony, belonging to France in the seventeenth century, so the Bank of France has transported a large number of gold bars to the island, totaling hundreds of millions of gold francs.</p>

<p>As for Iceland, it experienced a major shock after the British handed it over to the American forces. At that time, when the British in a corner of Shanghai heard this news, their faces turned white at first, then red in an instant, followed by a knowing smile at the corners of their mouths. This was because they could immediately imagine what was behind this sudden news. If they didn't understand why the American forces took over Iceland, they would understand even less why the American forces were stationed in Ireland.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Newfoundland, in the eyes of military strategists, can be considered the transportation gateway of the Western Hemisphere. Since the outbreak of the war, St. John's, the capital of the island, has transformed from a silent small port into the busiest dock in the world. All resources and personnel transported from the United States and Canada to England depart from this place. At the same time, because the island's lakes and harbors are intertwined, it is most suitable for building seaplane bases. And there are many hidden harbors, so the United States has built huge airfields and military ports here. We must not underestimate this island of more than 40,000 square miles; it is a link connecting England and America.</p>
<p>Having said all this, one can also know how busy the Americans are. However, it is not enough to explain why their transformation is so slow. Please turn your gaze from the Atlantic position to look at the situation within their country, and you will know that their official debut may take quite some time. To explain this point, we need to move from the first movement of the trilogy to the second movement.</p>
<p>What exactly is this second movement about? What kind of materials are there to give us as plot points for the novel? Due to space limitations, we can only roughly outline some points.</p>
<p>In the past, the isolationist policy of the American isolationists was a chaotic mess, as we all know. Later, in the speeches of important figures, this matter was rarely mentioned, and we generally believed that the isolationists had softened and abandoned their isolationist policy. However, since Roosevelt's election for his third term, the political parties in the United States have been engaged in open and secret struggles, consuming a great deal of energy and effort, but they have never clarified this issue of isolationism. With this isolationist stance, many of Roosevelt's plans were bound to encounter some tough obstacles. Although there was no 100% obstruction, the progress of a matter was inevitably delayed and made incomplete. According to a Washington dispatch on April 23, the US Secretary of State stated that the Republican Party had decided to abandon isolationism, which shows what the real problem was with the Americans' "reluctance to come out despite repeated calls."</p>
<p>Secondly, there is another tangled mess that has hindered the Americans in their affairs, and that is Hitler's masterpiece: the Fifth Column. If readers have a good memory, not long ago, Roosevelt joked to many important figures, saying that there were people among them who were being used by the enemy to create detrimental tools. Regarding this point, the Americans also took out their housekeeping skills and worked hard to eliminate them. Factory sabotage was suppressed by the military; secret work was eliminated by the well-known G-Men. This was not only the case domestically, but also in various South American countries, where the Americans helped to eliminate all Fifth Column activities. Didn't Peru and Ecuador have a full-scale conflict last July? That was precisely Hitler's Fifth Column's masterpiece. However, in less than three weeks, it vanished like smoke, and everyone believed that Argentina had come forward to resolve it, unaware that the Americans were supporting them from behind the scenes.</p>
<p>There were many arsonists, and the firefighting work was also unusually swift. However, the progress of affairs was ultimately affected to some extent. Due to this influence, the schedule of arrangements was delayed somewhat. Fortunately, the Americans are efficient in their work, and many major events are progressing rapidly. Among these major events, let us highlight a few.</p>
<p>In terms of finance, no one needs to worry about the Americans' affairs. Who doesn't know about the wealth of the United States? According to the tax revenue report for last year, the Americans had already reached their expected standard of 3 million gold dollars in tax revenue per day. Although the news has been slow lately, judging from the national defense budget, there has probably been a doubling of progress. This can be confirmed by a small matter: Since last August, the United States has been selling a type of national defense savings stamps, distributed by the National Retail Merchants Association. In September, 1.8 million stores across the country, with 4.6 million store employees, officially promoted sales to their 80 million regular customers. If we calculate it, how much revenue does this little gadget generate every day? However, this is different from the method of extracting wealth from the people and ignoring their lives and deaths. Because every stamp is a savings with a return of principal and interest. Financial leaders have said that while they certainly want to raise more funds for national defense, they also want to plan for the post-war economic recovery and the prosperity of the market.</p>
<p>Regarding the conscription of the army, navy, and air force, it is not appropriate to say too much about military matters. We only know that the US Air Force is progressing quite satisfactorily with the Canadian air force schools.</p>
<p>To encourage the military, the American slogan is "All men and women are citizens. That is the army behind the army." Every city and town across the country has large organizations for military-civilian gatherings. At the gatherings, local women voluntarily attend and organize music, drama, and other groups to serve the country.</p>
<p>As for the ladies, they are also fully mobilized. There are ladies who like to show off, and they all "enlist in the needle corps," requesting registration with the army, navy, and air force offices. However, the authorities persuaded them to return to the kitchen because the United States has ample manpower, and the government needs them to work hard in their positions, which means they should try to save on daily expenses and buy more national defense savings.</p>

<h3 id="e21">Southern Soviet Front: Large-Scale German Offensive Launched; Fierce Fighting on the Kerch Peninsula; German Forces Suffer Heavy Losses on the Northwestern Front <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>London, 12th (Reuters) - According to dispatches from Moscow, two million German troops have launched a large-scale offensive on the Donets River front within Soviet territory. This is the prelude to the long-awaited spring offensive. Unofficial sources from Moscow state that the German side is currently deploying a large military organization, including approximately 24 armored divisions, 1,000-2,000 first-line aircraft, and a large number of infantry, attacking along a 250-mile front from north of Dnipropetrovsk to the Kerch Peninsula in the south. Furthermore, according to a Reuters correspondent in Moscow, the Soviet side has stationed a large army on the Kerch Peninsula, and the German forces on the peninsula have launched an offensive. However, since the Soviet forces recovered the peninsula in late December, they have had ample time to strengthen its defenses. In March, a tank regiment from the German 22nd Tank Division attempted to break through the Soviet defenses, but failed. Whoever occupies the Kerch Peninsula and holds air superiority can control the gateway to the Soviet oil fields in the Caucasus. There is no doubt that the Soviet forces are fiercely resisting on the Kerch Peninsula, as part of the Soviet forces that recovered the peninsula came from the Black Sea Fleet, known for its strength, and another part is the elite troops dispatched by the Caucasus Command. Therefore, the German side has chosen this area with perfect land and air defenses to launch its first major offensive this spring. At the same time, the Soviet midday communique still stated that "nothing significant happened on the front last night," only adding that there was fierce fighting on the northwestern front.</p>
<p>Moscow, 12th (Reuters) - According to the Soviet communique, there is fierce fighting on the northwestern front, and the German side has suffered heavy losses. A Soviet team in a certain area killed 1,600 enemy soldiers in a single day. In the past week, the German side has lost 171 aircraft, while we have lost 86.</p>
<p>Moscow, 12th (Reuters) - The Soviet side issued a supplementary communique today stating that in tank battles on the southern front, Soviet tanks annihilated more than 200 enemy soldiers in a single area while attacking enemy defenses, and destroyed 11 guardhouses full of German soldiers. On the Kalinin front, 100 German soldiers were killed. Guerrillas active in Ukraine intercepted two Hungarian regiments and inflicted heavy losses on them, and wiped out a German team.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch) - The German High Command announced today that German and Romanian troops, covered by a large air force, launched an offensive on the Kerch Peninsula on the 8th of this month and are currently engaged in fierce fighting.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 12th (Havas News Agency Dispatch) - According to Soviet sources, the German army launched an offensive on the Kerch Peninsula in the south yesterday, and the fighting was fierce. Whether this offensive has been repelled has not been stated by the Soviet side. According to neutral military sources, the scale of this offensive is very large, and the weapons used are also very fierce. The Soviet Union is mainly using its air force for bombing. The front line is at the isthmus connecting the Kerch Peninsula to Crimea, only 12 miles wide. The German side has not reported on this offensive, presumably because the battle is still in its early stages.</p>
<p>London, 12th (Reuters) - A Reuters military correspondent stated that the German army launched a large-scale offensive in Crimea on May 8. The German side is using several divisions on the 15-20 mile long front, assisted by tanks and a large air force. The aircraft are not attacking transportation but bombing troops in the trenches. The weather in the war zone is currently clear, and the land is dry. The German attack has achieved slight success in the north, but in other areas of the front, they have been heavily defeated and retreated to their original positions.</p>
<p>London, 12th (Reuters) - The battle of Crimea is the first large-scale military action of the year, and some people believe this is the beginning of the German spring offensive.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 12th (Havas News Agency Dispatch) - According to Soviet sources, the German army attacked along the twelve-mile front of the Kerch Peninsula on the 7th of this month, making some progress in the north and being repelled in the south. The ground is now dry, and the weather is very clear. The German army intends to take this opportunity to clear the Red Army from the peninsula in order to advance towards Rostov in the Caucasus from Taganrog.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Haitong News Agency) - German-Romanian Allied forces, covered by a large air force, launched an offensive on the Soviet defense positions on the Kerch Peninsula on May 8, and are currently engaged in a major battle. Detailed information about the battle is not yet available here. It is only known that infantry and engineers landed behind enemy lines on May 8 under intense enemy fire. No one in the military here believes this is the beginning of the German "Spring Offensive." A government military spokesman said, "This is the first major offensive since the German winter defensive." It is reported that the Soviet Union has built strong defensive works in Kerch, gathered a large number of troops, and has air force facilities on land. The German-Romanian Allied forces used the new German weapons mentioned in the Führer's recent speech in this offensive against the peninsula, and they have been quite effective, but no poison gas has been used, and Germany has no intention of using poison gas.</p>
<p>Führer's Headquarters, 12th (Haitong News Agency) - The German war report this afternoon stated that the German-Romanian Allied forces on the Kerch Peninsula, with the assistance of the air force, attacked enemy positions on the 8th of this month, and the fighting is in full swing. German aircraft sank two transport ships totaling 5,000 tons and several small boats around the Kerch Peninsula and on the southeast coast of the Sea of Azov. Another merchant ship was damaged. All enemy attacks in Eastern Europe were repelled. The surprise attack of the German-Romanian-Croatian Allied forces was successful. The enemy's attack on Murmansk in Lapland failed.</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Havas News Agency Dispatch) - Military personnel here recently commented that the German army is operating very smoothly in Kerch and in the area east of Kharkov, whether taking a defensive or offensive posture. The Red Army attempted to attack in one location but was repelled by the German army. From the 3rd to the 9th of this month, the Soviet Union lost 219 aircraft, and Britain also lost a total of 109.</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Havas News Agency Dispatch) - The German military authorities announced that the Soviet army launched an attack on our position on the southern route of the eastern front on the 9th of this month, once breaking into our lines, but was then cut off by our army. As a result, we captured a large amount of military equipment, and the enemy left more than 500 corpses behind. In the Lapland front on the Murmansk front, although the Soviet army was very active, our army still made progress. Our air force bombed the enemy's transportation routes and supply depots east of Lake Ilmen, and many hits were scored.</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Havas News Agency Dispatch) - German military authorities announced that German aircraft bombed the Red Army and tank units east of Lake Ilmen yesterday with great success. In addition, 20 Red Army bunkers were destroyed.</p>

<p>Istanbul, 11th (Havas News Agency Dispatch) - According to a report from an Anatolian News Agency correspondent in Berlin, well-informed sources in Berlin believe that the Axis powers are now actively preparing militarily and politically in order to launch a decisive action to determine the outcome of the war. This decisive battle should be a lightning strike and a war of a comprehensive nature, launched simultaneously in all theaters. As for the British and American countries, although they are talking about opening a second battlefront, the Axis powers will take action faster than the enemy so that their enemies cannot strike first.</p>
<p>Washington, 11th (Havas News Agency Dispatch) - Military personnel here are questioning why Germany has not seriously resisted British air raids and believe that Germany is preserving all its strength for a decisive blow, which will likely be launched on the eastern front. However, it is difficult to say whether British air raids on Germany can be regarded as opening a second battlefront. However, a responsible view is that continuous British air raids may reduce Germany's industrial productivity and strike at German morale, but they are not decisive. In short, large-scale bombing will definitely affect the eastern front.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 12th (Reuters) - According to a report from Svenska Dagbladet's correspondent in Rome, Italian military observers say that Britain is sending a very large army, navy, and air force to Egypt and is expected to launch a new offensive in Africa.</p>
<p>Cairo, 12th (Reuters) - A British Middle East communique stated that there were more small engagements between small British units and Axis patrols in North Africa yesterday. After the Axis artillery units in the central area were bombed, they fell silent.</p>

<p>London, 12th (Reuters) - According to an announcement yesterday from the Air Force Headquarters in the Middle East, a large number of British fighter planes have flown to Malta to reinforce it. From the afternoon of the 9th to noon on the 10th of this month, German and Italian bombers, covered by a large number of fighter planes, attacked the island. The British side was able to send up the same number of fighter planes to intercept them. This was the first time since the start of the war that the two sides fought so fiercely, and the fighting was unprecedented. As a result of the fierce battle, a total of 31 Axis aircraft were shot down and 37 were damaged. In addition, 28 may have been destroyed.</p>

Malta has experienced more than 2,000 air raids, probably the highest record of air raids anywhere in this war. All the buildings and streets, I don't know to what extent they have been destroyed. The picture shows the scene of Valletta's Main Street.</p>

<h3 id="e30">French Concession to Implement Zonal Governance System; One Police Officer Stationed in Each Zone to Be Responsible for Security <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The French Concession Municipal Council has recently passed an order to establish a new police system within the concession. According to this system, the French Concession will be divided into many small zones, and one police officer will be stationed in each zone, responsible for all incidents occurring within their zone. Each zone chief will have two Chinese civilians as assistants. Their task is to report to the police officer in charge of the zone if they see anyone suspected of disturbing the peace within the concession, or discover privately hidden weapons and gatherings of suspicious people, etc. If the zone chiefs and assistants fail to perform their tasks in accordance with the authorities' instructions, they will be dismissed.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Temporary Travel Permits Must Be Collected in Person <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>According to the Information Office of the Public Works Department, the Chinese Evacuation Committee of the bureau is now issuing special travel permits for returning to their hometowns, in the same way as before, entrusted to the various hometown associations for distribution. However, these travel permits are only allowed for people returning to their hometowns from Shanghai, and they are not allowed to return to Shanghai again, which is very inconvenient. In view of this, the authorities have stipulated that another type of temporary travel permit will be issued, so that those who return to their hometowns and wish to return to Shanghai can come to Shanghai again within a limited time. The usage date is limited to the end of June. However, in order to be cautious, applicants must personally go to the Chinese Evacuation Committee office, Room 227, of the Public Works Department Building to discuss the matter and leave a thumbprint.</p>

<h3 id="e33">Since Small Denomination Notes are Being Hoarded, Substitute Vouchers are Issued; Valid for Use with Store Owner's Signature <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>The panic over small denomination notes in this city is very serious. Several companies and shops have begun to issue one-yuan substitute vouchers. Some are printed by themselves, and some are five-cent notes changed to one-yuan notes and stamped or signed by the shop owner. It is said that various cinemas are also planning to issue substitute vouchers in the near future. As for the tram company, according to the reporter's inquiry to the company's general manager, Evans, there are generally no plans to issue substitute vouchers because the company authorities do not regard the panic over small denomination notes as serious.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Increasing the Number of Rice Shops Still Requires Deliberation <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>According to a report from the Datong News Agency, the Municipal Council's Rice Management Committee, considering that since the restriction on the number of rice shops operating, 25 shops have had their licenses revoked or have voluntarily closed. Furthermore, in some areas, the scarcity of rice shops has led to increasingly crowded conditions for rice consumers. Therefore, increasing the number of rice shops to adjust and alleviate the situation is deemed necessary. However, whether to fully reinstate all previously closed rice shops or to selectively reinstate some in certain areas is still under consideration. A decision is expected to be announced soon.</p>

<p>Near the German Rowing Club on the Bund, a dead sperm whale was discovered the day before yesterday (the 11th). It had washed ashore on the 9th of this month. Passersby gathered to watch, expressing surprise and amazement, as it is rare for such a large, deep-sea creature to suddenly appear in the port of Shanghai. According to eyewitnesses, the whale was 40 feet long and covered in wounds, suggesting it had been dead for several days. Such a large fish was unprecedented for the local sampan boatmen, initially causing some panic. However, after realizing it was already dead, they used knives to cut open its belly, wanting to smell the peculiar odor of the whale. At that time, patrol police officers from the water police station passed by and, seeing the increasingly large crowd and smelling the fishy and rotten odor, went to investigate. They saw that the whale's belly had been opened, blood flowed all over the ground, and the stench was unbearable. They instructed the crowd to drag the whale to the side of the park and discard it into the large hole leading to the Huangpu River. The remains of this sea behemoth were then buried at the bottom of the river.</p>

<p>The 80 million yuan estate of the Jewish millionaire Hardoon has been in litigation for a long time and has not yet been resolved. In addition to Silas Hardoon's adopted children, there are also twelve Hardoon relatives residing in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, who, claiming to be Hardoon's close relatives, are demanding 61.5% of the estate.</p>
<p>One Adopted Daughter Files an Opposition</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, one of Silas Hardoon's adopted daughters, named Madeline Hardoon, represented by her biological father, Lin Beike, has hired lawyer Grossman and is scheduled to file an opposition yesterday afternoon (the 12th) against the Hardoon relatives' claim to the estate. According to Grossman's statement to a Times reporter, this lawsuit is exploratory in nature. Yesterday afternoon, he only represented Lin Beike in court, but Silas Hardoon's other adopted children have all consulted with him and will decide on subsequent lawsuits based on the outcome of this one.</p>
<p>Silas Hardoon Made No Indication During Her Lifetime</p>
<p>Silas Hardoon died on November 3rd of last year. Two weeks prior, twelve Hardoon relatives residing in Baghdad entrusted Okamoto, a Japanese lawyer in this city, to make a claim for 62.5% of the estate. Their reason was that they were the closest relatives to Hardoon by blood, and they stated that Jewish law stipulates that the deceased's close relatives can inherit 62.5% of the estate. Hardoon was originally from Baghdad and subject to Jewish law. At the time, Silas Hardoon was blind and had been suffering from lung disease for several years, nearing death. She may not have been aware of the twelve relatives' request, so lawyer Okamoto repeatedly sent letters to negotiate, but Silas Hardoon never replied until her death, believing that the Shanghai British Consular Court would protect her property from being seized.</p>
<p>Neither Will Mentioned It</p>
<p>After Silas Hardoon's death, two wills were suddenly discovered. The first was made in 1931, designating her adopted son George Hardoon as the main heir. The second was made in 1937, and the main heir was Silas Hardoon. Both parties filed lawsuits with the British Consular Court, which has not yet made a decision. The outbreak of the Pacific War has further complicated the case. Because Silas Hardoon was Chinese, a request for several million yuan in inheritance tax was made. In mid-March, a notice was issued, stating that if no legitimate opposition was filed within 20 days, the 80 million yuan estate would be managed by the twelve Hardoon relatives in Baghdad. Silas Hardoon and George Hardoon originally competed fiercely with each other, but now they have to unite to cope with the situation. However, they are already finding it difficult to collect 500,000 yuan in rent each month. The Hardoon relatives ultimately resorted to appealing to the Japanese authorities for assistance. It is heard that the Japanese authorities have immediately provided effective assistance.</p>

<h3 id="e47">Rongwu Society's 46th Lecture: Explanation of the Two Characters of "Zhongyong" (The Doctrine of the Mean) <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Zhong means "just right," and Yong means "ordinary."</p>
<p>At the 46th Guoxue (National Studies) lecture of the Rongwu Sutra Speaking Society, Yang Zhongyi spoke on the "Essence of Zhongyong" in four chapters. He stated: The "mind method" that the sages passed down is detailed in the chapter on Zhongyong alone. The principle of adhering to the mean came from Tang, Yao, Shun, and Yu. The essence of purity lies in the effort before adhering to the mean, focusing on the human heart and leading to the ultimate moral mind. The moral mind is the original nature, the correctness of destiny, and the publicness of heavenly principles. Even the most foolish cannot be without it, but it is subtle and difficult to see, sometimes clear and sometimes obscure. Attaining this and preserving it means that the function of the human heart is none other than the moral mind. There is no excess or deficiency in movement and stillness, and the subtle becomes manifest, like a rudder having control, so there is no harm even when encountering waves. The human heart produces biases in form and qi, and human desires, even the most knowledgeable cannot be without them, tasting leads to ruin, then only the sages, forgetting, will act madly, like a boat without a rudder, drifting and forgetting to return, inevitably capsizing upon entering the waves. Knowledge, perception, and desire are moved by things, and material desires induce and transform, leading to drowning and harm, on the verge of falling, easily flowing towards evil, hence dangerous and uneasy. If the moral mind is the master, and the human heart obeys, then the dangerous becomes safe. Distinguishing the boundary between the two without mixing is choosing good. Yan Zi chose the Zhongyong, adhering to the correctness of the original mind without deviating, holding firm. Yan Zi attained good, fearing not to lose it. Precision is first, unity is important, there must be no interruption. Truly being able to hold it is called first. Yao said "adhering to the mean," Confucius said "timely mean," the principle of being just right, without excess or deficiency. A way that does not conform to the mean is heterodox. The mean that does not conform to the time is not proper. Zhongyong, Zhong, Cheng said "the upright path without bias," Lu's book "without excess or deficiency." Zhu combined them, without bias is the mean before it is expressed, Lu said "before it is expressed, this mind is extremely empty, without any bias," naturally so, that is, Cheng's "meaning in the mean," standing without being near the four sides, the body of the mind, the center of the earth. Without excess or deficiency, expressing at the right time, righteousness combines mean and harmony, appropriate at the time, achieving just right, Lu said "using this mind to respond to all changes, nothing is not mean," seeing it in things, each attaining its mean, naturally so, that is, Cheng's "one mean way," acting without being before or after, the function of the mind, the rightness of principle, the mean of things. Although what is meant cannot but be biased towards things, within one thing, there is no bias, it should be so, that is, the criterion of just right. Yong, Cheng said "unchanging principle," Zhu said "ordinary," above facing the enlightened, below without fear, not different, can be constantly practiced, the ordinary way of the five relationships in daily use, even in haste or adversity, it does not violate for a long time, naturally the principle of things, without being strange or extreme, ordinary and long-lasting and unchangeable, if things that shock the world and startle the public can be temporary but not ordinary, not a very high and difficult righteousness to practice, how can it be called conforming to the times. Yong said practice, even if it is subtle, dare not ignore it. Mean and then constant is the natural principle, constant and then able to have mean, people rely on their duties, reverse the norm and exercise discretion, combined change is constant, Yong is seen in things, it is principle, harmony is in it, harmony originates from the heart, it is temperament. After the lecture, the next lecture on Buddhism on the seventeenth was announced and then dismissed.</p>

<p>By Jue Qian</p>
<p>After dinner, I embraced a way of killing time that didn’t require going to places to watch the horse racing or the cinema as those required spending money, so I aimlessly strolled on the vast road.</p>
<p>Walking, walking, heading east along Hankou Road; with steady steps, if the ground were covered with a thick layer of snow, one could truly leave a series of neat and numbered footprints. My head was lowered, and my mind was silently contemplating, pondering – my past, present, and future.</p>
<p>A chilling gust of wind; whistled past me; I looked up and saw that what was lying in front of my eyes was a vast Huangpu River.</p>
<p>I leaned against the iron railing beside the Huangpu River, and began to gaze aimlessly at the opposite bank of the river, to the left and to the right.</p>
<p>The Huangpu River was calm, and the sparse, starlike boat lights were scattered across the surface of the river; embellishing it into a glittering and dazzling beautiful scene. The usually bustling Huangpu Wharf was now ‘sealed tight’; only one or two of the wharves were open, crowded on both sides with men and women carrying luggage and packages; undoubtedly, they were a group driven by the whip of life, practicing a ‘return home movement’. The noisy and chaotic clamor replaced the shouts of the coolies and porters when they were carrying goods before.</p>
<p>The Hedland bronze statue standing in front of the Jianghai Customs House, in the dim electric light, could still be seen to have donned a green coat; proving that it had already experienced decades of wind and rain. He held his hands, bowed his head, as if he were pondering something; however, I could not guess what he was thinking about at all! – Was he still worried about the future of the customs? Or was he planning a new life for the customs in the future? Or…</p>
<p>In short, this Hedland, the hero of the customs, is now powerless to break the unprecedented solitude in the history of the customs; and to open up new transportation routes between the isolated island and the outside world!</p>
<p>The big clock of the Jianghai Customs House chimed nine times; I cast one last glance at the standing Hedland bronze statue, and then strolled home with my hands behind my back.</p>

<h3 id="e56">The New Organization of the Public Works Department That Solves All Problems (I) - The Work of the Comprehensive Committee - Concerns Everyone - Special Article by Our Newspaper <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>This article was written by Mr. Brown and originally published in the English-language Shanghai Evening Post. It is divided into eleven sections, describing in detail the internal situation and work of the organizational system established by the Public Works Department since the August 12th Incident to cope with extraordinary events. It is extremely clear and accurate. We have asked Mr. Zhang Yinhuai to excerpt and translate the entire article section by section so that the world can gain a considerable understanding of the current organization of the Public Works Department. This is something readers will be happy to see, isn't it? - Editor</p>
<p>I. Think Tank</p>
<p>At the same time every morning of every week, a special meeting is held in a room at the end of a corridor in the Public Works Department Administration Building. At ten o'clock every morning, eight men and a petite, capable female stenographer file into this spacious room, seriously discussing all far-reaching policies. The outside world knows very little about this special committee, and even less about the weight of its responsibilities and the breadth of its activities. If they were to understand, how surprised they would be!</p>
<p>No matter where we are, there is always a fate that carves out our future. In Shanghai, it is this special committee. When these eight men sit down every morning to conduct their daily discussions, the lives of the residents of the Shanghai International Settlement are affected in one way or another. This is because this committee is the nerve center of a complex organization. It is the management center of a vast control network, whose tentacles extend outwards, encircling countless trivial matters and annihilating countless sources of evil. It is the brain of a huge and well-balanced machine, unifying goals and directing work. Its name is the Comprehensive Committee.</p>
<p>Let Them Laugh and Scold</p>
<p>In another era, long past, the public was accustomed to using the Public Works Department as a common pastime for laughter and scolding. Everyone did this. Even a newspaper with so little power that it could not harm it joined the ranks. Journalists armed themselves with ink. Radio broadcasters emitted invisible cold arrows into the air. Cartoonists' pens were saturated with poisonous sweat.</p>
<p>But scolding is often useful. The Public Works Department might say, "Let you scold to your heart's content; rather than harm, it is often a favor." Last December, we saw such a complete change in this city, everything was shaken out of its ordinary course. Yet it was in this difficult and arduous situation that the Public Works Department soared above the chaotic criticism, showing the doubting public that it was indeed a powerful weapon fighting for the public welfare.</p>
<p>At that time, the Public Works Department, like everyone else, was thrown into a world of helpless chaos, a world with a series of problems and no past experience or knowledge to rely on. Clearly, this was a time that required emergency measures. Several emergency organizations and committees were created to deal with various matters. But above these, there was also a need for an institution that could study all-encompassing problems as a whole and coordinate the work of other departments to achieve unity. This institution was the Comprehensive Committee.</p>
<p>The First Iron Law</p>
<p>Pope (translator of Homer) once said that order is the first iron law of heaven. This implies "a place that can accommodate all things and where all things have their place." Order is what clear thinking depends on, what bodily health depends on, and what urban peace depends on. Heaven and earth, planets, and even this international center, should all have differences in their order, position, and degree in various procedures. All things are regulated by immutable laws; all things are predestined: all things are the result of previous causes: there is no need to have Homer or a Pharisee philosopher to believe this. Wherever there is a controlling hand, nine times out of ten, it is that Comprehensive Committee.</p>
<p>Daily Work</p>
<p>Every day at ten o'clock in the morning, the Comprehensive Committee gathers to study the various problems of the day. These meetings last about one or two hours, during which the eight members discuss the various parts of emergency measures and the questions sent by the various committees. There are no limits to the problems that are placed before them every day. A glance at the list will show the following different properties: rice, transportation management, coal, flour, refugees, automobile permits, soap, gasoline, finance, sugar, cigarettes, vegetable oil, rent, currency, general price control, price limit enforcement, etc., and all other endless problems. Only the sky—or, more precisely, Shanghai and everything in it—is its limit.</p>
<p>Let us move from the "problem" to look at the people who "solve the problem." All eight are people with amazing abilities and a heavy sense of responsibility. The chief is the Chairman of the Shanghai Public Works Department, followed by two directors of the bureau. In addition, there is the Director-General of the Public Works Department, the Director of the Finance Department, a representative of the Police Department, and the Secretary of the Committee. The list of members is as follows: Katsuo Okazaki (Chairman), Frederick Kroon, George Leclère, Hiropon Terauchi (Director-General), Mao Jie (Director of Finance), Duncan (Representative of the Police Department), Basil (Secretary), Toraro Gokunomiya (Private Assistant to the Chairman)</p>
<p>A good official must possess five characteristics: talent, concise skill, agile decision-making, patience, and fairness. All eight of these men have them.</p>

<h3 id="e57">After All, the Truth is Vague - Factory Yarn Prices Have Fluctuated Greatly - Selling Out in a Panic Like Ants on a Hot Stone - Rushing to Buy Back, Exhausted Like a Headless Fly <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the rise and fall of the Shuang Ma factory yarn market has made people's joys and sorrows unpredictable, and the enthusiasm of the people in the market, like being drunk and crazy, is also surprising. It was found that on the 9th, the chips were slightly full, and they plummeted thousands of miles, from 5,300 yuan to 4,800 yuan. In the afternoon, the bulls of a certain number had no ability to pay the difference and were squeezed down and closed. At this time, the panic of the people and the embarrassment of the bulls cannot be described. Selling everywhere, no one accepted, the lowest price was 4,400 yuan. There was a difference of 1,000 yuan in one day. Unexpectedly, the market opened suddenly on the 11th, and the market order was chaotic, so that the speculators were uncertain. Not only like a Wuxi puppet spinning around, but also like headless flies rushing around. Only buying in, not selling out. Those who sold out the day before were like ants on a hot stone, sitting and standing uncomfortably. It is said that the factory order can be returned, and it is also said that the speculators close to the factory side suddenly came to collect as much as possible. Therefore, the shorts of the previous day changed from short to long, and the market went up directly. "In fact, big fish eat small fish." As for the general small companies taking advantage of this chaotic situation, they showed their skills greatly, and the opportunity to make a fortune came again. Shaking their heads and tails in the market, shouting and screaming wildly, and falsely reporting prices, the difference was thirty to fifty yuan a grade. For example, the purchase price was 5,180 yuan, and the selling price was only 5,120 to 30 yuan. Among them, the oil and water of fifty to sixty yuan was put into the bag. The difference is so huge. What is the way for the households who do a package transaction with small companies? According to this situation, you can wake up. Today's father raised to 5,670 yuan. The closing price is 1,300 yuan higher than the price on the 9th. As for the big households using the yarn factory to return or cooperate, the Shuang Ma factory order is used as a bet, creating an unprecedented state of terror. Some people say that if you continue to kick the ball like this, one day your foot bones will be broken. Therefore, it is warned that the general small households should quickly leave the tiger's mouth, move to a good place, do some spot transactions, the danger is light, and the profit can be stable. Otherwise, if you are not aware of it, and you want to wear a hole, I am afraid that you will step into a trap and it will not be easy to recover. At this time, it is too late to regret.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Spot Yarn is Stable as Ever <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is quiet and spot goods are still stable as ever. 42 counts of Blue Phoenix is called 1650 yuan to 450 yuan, 32 counts of Lì Mǎ is called 14,200 yuan, 80 counts of Cai Qiu is 39,700 yuan, 60 counts of Wu Zi is 24,000 yuan, 32 counts of Bǎo Guāng is 11,100 yuan, 60 counts of Cai Qiu is 26,000 yuan, 32 counts of Jin Tǎ is 9,800 yuan, 32 counts of Blue Phoenix is 11,050 yuan, 32 counts of Xiān Táo is 12,850 yuan, 20 counts of Blue Phoenix is 7,700 yuan, 20 counts of Yuè Qín is 7,000 yuan, 20 counts of Tiān Nǚ is 6,550 yuan to 600 yuan, 20 counts of Shuang Mǎ is 6,600 yuan to 650 yuan, 10 counts of Red Shuang Mǎ is 5,110 yuan to 150 yuan, 10 counts of Tóng Zǐ Jūn is 5,050 yuan to 100 yuan, 10 counts of Shuang Dì Qiú is 4,850 yuan, 10 counts of Hóng Bǎo Yí is 5,100 yuan, 20 counts of Shuang Mǎ factory order initially rose to 5,550 yuan, but at this time buyers came one after another. The price rose to 5,680 yuan. Some profit-makers spit out, and it loosened to 5,550 yuan again. The closing price rose to 5,600 yuan again. It is said that it was done outside the market to 5,680 yuan. At present, the yarn market is rising and falling wildly, and it is in the thousands of yuan. It can be imagined that speculators are like being drunk and infatuated. Among them, the number of people who cry and laugh is unknown.</p>
<h3 id="e59">When the Head Arrives at the Qing Order, It Wants to Rise but Falls Instead <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The cloth market was firm first and then tired yesterday. It is because the actual sales are few, and when the Qing order arrives, the hoarders have the intention of spitting out at high prices, so the shouting price is weak. 16-pound Earth coarse cloth is 260 yuan, Fei Hong is 250 yuan, 8-pound Zhen Zhong is 137 yuan and a half, but none of them have been sold. 12-pound Earth fine cloth stack order is 128 yuan, spot goods are 226 yuan and a half, Fugui is 125 yuan, then there is a small amount of transaction. Peach Lady Lin is 351 yuan, Chick spot goods is 350 yuan, factory order is 357 yuan, Changshou Fu silk is still back to between 7 yuan 56 cents, the transaction is extremely rare. Dong cloth wants to rise but falls instead, the situation is also flat and tired. 12-pound Long Tou fine cloth stack order opened in the morning at 291 yuan, the price rose to 291 yuan and a half, and then turned down. The afternoon closed at 287 yuan. The afternoon Father's dish was a small 2 yuan, closing at 186 yuan, the old order was 252 yuan and a half, the bank order was 228 yuan, and the evening closing price of Cai Qiu fine cloth was 255 yuan, a drop of 2 yuan and a half. Calling Junzi Serge Red Order opened at 1 yuan 6 cents 3 points, the smallest price was 1 yuan 4 cents 8 points, and the evening closed at 9 yuan 5 cents, also falling 6 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Gold Shops Vigorously Sell, Spot Gold Falls Slightly <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot gold market was weak and dark. It rose slightly but suddenly fell. It is because a certain spot gold shop alone vigorously sold one hundred and dozens of taels, and people's hearts were soft. From the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially opened at 21,500 yuan, which was 50 yuan lower. A certain gold shop and securities shop came to (sell cotton yarn) to set in, rising 200 yuan, reaching 21,700 yuan. Soon, the securities shop resold, and a certain gang also came out. The spot gold shop suddenly vigorously sold, and after 10 o'clock, it fell. The price at 11 o'clock was 21,200 yuan. A certain gold shop came to drag in, and it was seen that it rose directly to 21,450 yuan. The final transaction price at noon was 21,400 yuan, which was 150 yuan less than the closing price of the previous day, with a difference of 500 yuan. There were many transactions. The afternoon price was around 21,350 yuan.</p>
<p>The exchange price of silver building jewelry gold per tael is still 2,250 yuan for Da Xin colleagues (the purchase price is reduced by 200 yuan), patterned silver is 18 yuan, and the black market price is 15 yuan 56 cents. A silver coin is 9 yuan 24 cents, and it is mostly seen to be falling.</p>
<h3 id="e61">The Header Discount Rises Another Five Yuan <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market, British and American gold pounds were quite stable. The former was still 500 yuan, and the latter was still 510 yuan. The US dollar ticket was 32 yuan 6 cents, and there were transactions. The Hong Kong ticket was still 5 yuan and 5 yuan 1 cent. The military ticket was 7 yuan 3 cents 2 points in the morning, rose to 3 cents 8 points in the meantime, then small to 3 cents 1 point, and then Father returned to 7 yuan 3 cents 8 points, an increase of 8 points compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Yesterday's header discount rate was as high as 20 yuan and 25 yuan per thousand yuan, an increase of another 5 yuan. The interbank lending rate of the Money Industry Association rose 2 cents in the morning, to 1 cent 2 cents, and the premium for Central Reserve coupons was about 3 cents 3 points per yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e62">The Undertow of Public Bonds Rises Again <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>In the dark market of public bonds, the market suddenly rose with huge waves yesterday. As the author expected, it could not be quiet for a long time. The transaction suddenly surged, which is enough to show that the gap between the multiple parties is moving, which has been concluded. Because the multiple parties originally intended to absorb, but if there is no big seller on the table, the multiple parties will never buy in. On the one hand, they are preventing people from paying attention, and on the other hand, they are preventing the market price from rising. Buying only when there is selling is the real investor. For example, yesterday, Tongli sold a large amount, and the multiple parties successively collected it, without leaving a trace in the market. On the one hand, the seller did not want to recover, and on the other hand, the buyer never saw it spit out. It can be seen that the absorption person's strong financial resources, non-financial circles and what? Yesterday, it fell sharply by more than 2 yuan. The Jiazhong fell the most, because the sellers were surging, and those who followed the trend were also extremely busy. If the future only sells today, then the rebound will also be very strong, because those who follow the trend to go short the day before will inevitably offset, and the colleagues who absorb at low prices are expected to surge. In this way, it will tend to be a situation of alternating cold and heat. Yesterday, Tongli ranked first among the sellers, followed by Tongkang, with a number of about 1.12 million, which was completely collected by the multiple parties within 15 minutes. The rest, such as Shunheng, Runli, Yuanhe, Yichang, Jiufeng, Xufeng, all had sales, and the selling of scattered retail investors was particularly busy. The receivers were mainly Hu Heji, Lida, Chengkang, Lianhe, Wuhe, etc., and Xinji and Hongda's absorption also surged. The rest were the thirty-eighth and Dechang, and Gongmao was not weak. Tongyuan, Renfeng, Xinhua, Zhongfu, Dazhong, Zhenhua, and Shuntai all had considerable income. Because it was the smallest closing price, the buyers had already raised several corners in the dark after the closing. As a result, the market price fell sharply by 1 yuan 9 cents to 2 yuan 6 cents. The father was about 1.56 million yuan. The following is a brief table:</p>
<h3 id="e63">Soap Street Sales are Active <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The soap market has been weak for a long time. In the past two days, the trend has suddenly become brisk. Recently, due to the smooth sales of rural vendors, the sales on this street have been active. The factory side dispatched a little bit of goods, and the holders were reluctant to sell them cheaply, waiting for a good price to sell them. The price was stable and firm. The price of Gu Ben Soap in the French Concession was 340 yuan. Because of the strict ban on transfer, the price in the Public Concession was 355 yuan. The same goods have a difference of 15 yuan. Bai Xiangmao Soap is 307 yuan, and Huang Xiangmao Soap is 280 yuan and 270 yuan. There were transactions. Qian Dao Soap is 285 yuan, which is more than 10 yuan higher than the previous day. Matches are not very glorious. Phoenix brand is still open at 5,300 yuan, Meili brand is 5,400 yuan, and Miscellaneous brand is 4,400 yuan. The foreign candles have risen slightly. The price of White Rite's candles per box is 190 yuan, which is 10 yuan higher than the previous dish.</p>

<h3 id="e65">Li Shifang Talks About Theatrical Life - Predicts Mei Lanfang's Return to Shanghai at the End of the Month <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— Zhèn</p>
<p>I haven't seen Mei Lanfang for a long time. The tens of thousands of Mei fans at sea are so eager. Looking at Mei can quench thirst, so now the arrival of Li Shifang can also make Mei fans enjoy themselves and quench their thirst. This time, Li Shifang, with the honor of Little Mei Lanfang, brought Wang Erpian's Huqin and Ni Qiuping's Erhu, a famous Qin ticket, to Shanghai for her debut performance. Every day, she rehearses and sings a large number of Mei dramas that have not been seen on the stage for a long time, such as Luoshen, Xishi, Sheng Sih Hen, Fengh Huan Chao... Although the results cannot be compared with Mei Lanfang, among the up-and-coming Mei school Tsing Yi, this only twelve-year-old young actor can be regarded as rare.</p>
<p>On Saturday afternoon, I visited Shifang at his residence with photographer Kang Jun. Under the meeting, not to mention on the stage, "underneath," the appearance, and even the conversation and demeanor, were very similar to Mei Lanfang. At the same time, we also met the up-and-coming famous Jing Yuan Shihai. After taking pictures, we talked casually. First, we mentioned the beauty of Biejí dancing with a sword. Yuan Shihai said that they both had some insights on this play. The Overlord learned completely from the Yang school, and Yu Ji learned of course completely from Mei Lanfang. Generally, the Overlord is decorated with Jing, and only a share of bravery is performed, lacking the tragic composition. In this regard, they are confident that they still have a spectacle performance. Talking about the script, Li Shifang told us that in addition to Mei's plays, Jin Ping Mei and Hong Xiao were adapted from Shang Xiaoyun's plays. The Baihua Princess, which will be shown, has the same story as Cheng Yanqiu's Daughter's Heart, but the compilation is different. When asked about Professor Qi Rushan, a theatrical expert who praised Mei, Shifang said that he didn't know where his old gentleman was now. Some people said he was in Hong Kong, in Shanghai, and in the north, but none of them were there. Maybe he went to the mainland.</p>
<p>We Father talked about the nobility of the north and south life. Shifang said that according to the current difficulties in remittance between the north and the south, and the soaring exchange rate, (the Federal Reserve ticket is currently worth more than 5 yuan in Shanghai currency), it will be very difficult for northern actors to come to the south in terms of remuneration and silver. Ma Lianliang sells Federal Reserve tickets for 3 yuan in the north, which is already 17 yuan in Shanghai currency. Ordinary actors are around 2 yuan in the north, which is also considerable. Entertainment is not a necessity after all, and too expensive seating also has an impact. If you add taxes, Ma Lianliang must sell more than 20 yuan in Shanghai, and Ma himself gets very ordinary, which is the truth.</p>
<p>Speaking of the life in the north, he said that a seat of wine needs 150 yuan in Federal Reserve tickets, and many things cannot be bought. The price of the headgear is similar in the north and the south, but the materials in the south are better, so I want to buy some things in the future, clothes, headgear, and go back, which can also be seen in the life of the north.</p>
<p>Finally, he said: I will tell you a piece of good news. My teacher, Mr. Mei, will definitely return to the north by plane before the end of the month. Many friends helped, and everything is ready. Taizhenwaizhuan is waiting for him to sing again. Teacher Mei will also play for him. This is indeed good news for Mei fans.</p>

<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(V) Reciprocal Repayment</p>
<p>That night, Wei Cheng sat alone under the lamp in Shuangmei Study, thinking about tomorrow, when both his great aunt and second aunt should be coming. He had a cigarette in his mouth, staring blankly at his father's portrait. Suddenly, there were footsteps outside the door. He couldn't tell who was coming, so he raised his head and didn't make a sound. Who knew that Cuizhen walked in, carrying light steps, and stood beside Wei Cheng. Wei Cheng turned his head and said, "Sister Cuizhen, you work hard during the day, you should go to bed earlier at night." As he spoke, he smelled a refreshing fragrance of soap from Cuizhen's body. Cuizhen said, "We are young, it doesn't matter if we sleep later. Brother Cheng doesn't know, since I came here, I have been sleeping later than Brother Cheng every day. Last night, Brother Cheng returned to the room from here, and the grandfather clock rang three times, it was three o'clock." Wei Cheng said, "Oh, that's not right." Cuizhen said, "The great aunt is dead, and the second aunt's body is not very healthy. The magpies inside and A Xing outside, they all snore as soon as they fall, and they don't care about Brother Cheng's affairs. The second aunt once said, I can't sleep earlier than Brother Cheng!"</p>
<p>Wei Cheng looked at Cuizhen's two big eyes and said from his heart, "Sister Cuizhen, why don't you sit down? I was busy talking, but I was sitting there carelessly." Cuizhen pulled a chair close to her feet and sat down, smiling, "Did Miss Chen send a gift?" Wei Cheng said, "Not yet." Cuizhen said, "What about Huang Long?" Wei Cheng threw the cigarette butt into the spittoon, but didn't hit it. Cuizhen hurriedly picked up the cigarette butt and threw it into the spittoon, and asked, "What about Huang Long?" Wei Cheng said, "Huang Long has already sent a very generous gift." Cuizhen sat down and asked, "Did my uncle send a gift?" Wei Cheng said, "I didn't hope he would send a gift, and I didn't send him the news." Wei Qing sent a gift, which was a paper scroll and a pair of paper couplets. I don't know where he copied the ready-made couplets from. The scroll says four words, Fushou Quan Gui (complete happiness and longevity). It's just that people who don't know anything like to drop words, which is really helpless." Cuizhen said, "A scroll and couplets must cost a lot of money, right?" Wei Cheng said, "It doesn't cost much money." Cuizhen smoothed the hair on her forehead and smiled slightly, "Brother Cheng, I have something I can't say." As she spoke, she smiled again. (73)</p>

<p>Gao Zhanfei is back in Shanghai. He is the first of the Hong Kong filmmakers to come back. The Shanghai movie fans are naturally very concerned about his situation after his departure, as well as his future actions. But after Lao Gao returned to Shanghai, he lived in seclusion and rarely contacted the outside world. Apart from one or two news about him that was rehashed in the newspapers, he was still very estranged from the audience.</p>
<p>Recently, he has signed a contract with Zhonglian. The first new film is directed by Wang Yin and co-starred with Yuan Meiyun, "Yi Hen Bu Xiang Feng Wei Jia Shi." Lao Gao's demeanor is as it used to be. When he appeared in the Dingxiang Garden, the first question his friends asked him was "The Mystery of Bai Yang." Lao Gao smiled and did not answer, so this "mystery" will become a permanent mystery. He now lives at home, in other words, he lives with Gao Qianping.</p>
