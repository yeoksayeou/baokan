<h3>大光明電影院中　聽講孔子之敎</h3>
<p>— 溪南</p>
<p>五年來，足不履大光明影戲院之門，自從見了孔子誕辰紀念特別大講演會之預告，頗思一聽中山久四郞的「日本之道與孔子之敎」一番高論。吾雖不解日本語言，好在有繙譯，增加吾聽講的勇氣。到了十二時光景，我的兒子向我說：「你如果要去聽，還是早些去：以你的安步當車，走到大光明，也許要半小時光景，恐防要客滿見遺了」。我以爲聽講孔子之敎，及大光明的座位衆多，遲一些去也何妨。却不料到了大光明門前，跑馬廳的時鐘，正指着十二時三十分，我已跨進大光明之門，果然，與我前後而來的尙有多人。及跨進池子，自後至前，自左至右，可說周游一轉，要覓一坐位，眞個千難萬難，終究在最末一排，得着一席地，說來僥倖。在塲的人，小至手抱的娃娃，大至盈頭白髮，小帽夾袍，至於婦稚靑年，更不必說。我纔覺悟我兒子的話是對的，而我自己的見解，是犯了時代觀念的錯誤；正爲演講之後，還有大東亞戰爭影片可看。</p>
<p>人衆了，又多小孩子，坐在後排的常聽到椅位起立的篤聲，小孩說三道四聲，於前面的講演聲，不無多少夾雜了，我雖聚精會神去聽，畢竟有時還聽不甚淸楚，未免有負此行。</p>
<p>中山久四郞的演講，足足有兩小時功夫，引證詳博，說理透澈，有許多地方，使我聽了，彌覺自愧。大慨說是：孔子所說的智仁勇（按所謂智仁勇，即好學近乎智，力行近乎仁，知恥近乎勇）及見危致命，殺身成仁，犧牲一己，與日本尙武的精神相合。而且日本某大將常以「見義不爲無勇也」勉勵他的部屬，可見孔子思想精神深入日本人的心理。此外又談到足食足兵，及子路之勇，中山先生確乎於孔門之書，多所硏讀。</p>
<p>其次講到孔子尊王的一番苦心孤詣，忠君思想，一一地叙述出來，以爲孔子未嘗不思將周室尊奉，世爲天下主；而以見尊奉萬世一系的皇室，及日本民族的忠君愛國，與孔敎精神相符合。他還鄭重地勗勉我們中國人說：「中國雖說現在是國體不同，可是忠君仍是需要的，就是忠於國。」這是我撮述他講詞的大意。可是中國正要將忠字範圍，硬生生地緊束在「忠君」兩字上面去，而說孔道忠君爲不合於現代中國，要假此將孔敎來打倒，甚至並一「忠」字也覺厭聽了，眞是可笑。要曉得君字從尹從口，爲出言發令之人，並不定含有帝皇臭味，淺見之徒，以「忠」爲不便，却不料中山久四郞先生倒與我們中國的孫中山先生提倡中國固有道德技能，用意正相同。諄諄地勉勵我們，這是應該接受而且感激的。</p>
<p>提起中山兩字，不禁廻想到孫先生爲革命而逃亡到日本的一種紀念。今日中山久四郞先生於革命易世易代，亦多所闡述，不過他自有他的立塲。</p>
<p>談到了忠，就連帶　孝，有人說忠孝不能兩　，　　忠臣常出於孝子才門。中國人　「孝」，我敢說爲　　哲學家　未嘗夢見。將孝的意　，不要說孝經一書，即見於其他經書中，亦說得淋漓　　。可是中國人在四十年前痼於　排外　的毒，將歐美的學說，看得半文不値，不分皂白的加以排斥。及四十年來又是中了「洋迷」的毒，不論是好是壞，只要是「洋貨」，不加選擇，都說是好的；而將自己的東西，都說是壞的，一概拋棄，眞所謂發財票藏在竹筒裏，擲向河裏去一般標新立異，自己不孝順父母，還要人家去非孝，何以要如此，以爲孝是歐美人所不談，所以要排斥，咳，你想可憐不可憐！</p>
<p>末了，他又談到上海是東亞大商埠，所以又談到孔子的經濟思想，如子貢的「億則屢中」及「生財有大道」一番說話，他於子貢又引出史記貨殖傳來作證。確乎孔子之道，得行於列國，子貢與有力焉。足見經濟與文化關係之密切。</p>
<p>總之，日本人一切做事講學，自有他中心思想，他處處不忘記他的本位努力，他從這努力之中，發揚他立國處世的精神，這是日本民族的長處，中國民族的短處。因爲中國的民族，雖說是孔道發生之國，然而見異思遷，缺乏內心的把握。中山久四郞曾引說孔子的話，道不行，乘桴浮於海，如果浮海的話。最近的國家就是日本了。啊喲，眞個孔子之道，要如他所說，走到日本去了。這是中國人的恥辱！然而中國人何嘗知恥？猶　孔子的道理冷擱在一邊。不識時務的要主張　經，號稱識時務的，往往未嘗讀過四書五經，究不知什麽一回事；學時髦，拾牙慧，　爲讀經是腐化落伍的舉動。中國人號　執中，而其思想　動，往往矯枉過直，不得中道而行之，眞正可嘆！</p>
<p>中山久四郞，要求中國靑年接受孔敎的精神，說來慚愧，中國的靑年，正有不知四書五經爲何物。學校中不授經書，而人學的入學試騐，偏多從經書中命題，我們只知道做敎帥的應該「有敎無類」，却不料今日的敎帥，竟實行了「不敎而誅」，事之滑稽，莫過於此。</p>
<p>我八九歲讀論語四子書，十一二歲讀春秋左傳。當時我的師兄，也爲我逐篇解釋，我也，須隔日回講，可是我絲毫不覺其好處，只覺其難處。及後入學校，又將所謂五經補讀齊全了。當時旣要讀撥拉馬，又要習筆算數學代數方程式，忽忽地過去了，未嘗有回味功夫。其後出學涉世，多經一事，多歷一番，有時將論語來排遣，啊　　眞使我詫異，爲何以前不知其美，而今反覺其意義雋永，眞應了孔老夫子「溫故而知新」這句話，何以他生於二千數百年前而他的話還能適用於現代社會，可見人類學術思想有變遷，而人的本性行爲還是不脫原有的窠臼。更佩服到孔老夫子，何以他短短的七十二三歲年齡，而他所說的話，眞有「萬世師表」的可能，其智眞不可及了。趙普以半部論語治天下，不要說半部，若能扼住得論語幾句話，亦可以受用無窮。這不是我恭維的話，惟有身歷此中，方知吾言之不謬，所以吾主張，凡是一個中國學生，應該讀一部論語，選讀左氏春秋，你看動業彪炳，功烈在民，大都是深通左氏春秋的呀！</p>

<h3>孔子精神</h3>
<p>— 文</p>
<p>孔子之道，幾千年來，深入人心，我們本於「溫故知新」之義，就其遺敎，加以涵泳體察，當非迂闊之論。</p>
<p>孔子曰：「吾道一以貫之」，此一貫之道，即謂之仁。仁爲道德的統一原理，孔子敎育弟子，即注重道德實踐，能自立立人者，方稱爲士。孔子所提倡的忠恕之道，亦即是仁的道德。孔子重信，「自古皆有死，民無信不立」。信亦即仁的一環</p>
<p>孔子的自傳：「吾十有五，而志於學，三十而立，四十而不惑，五十而知天命，六十而耳順，七十而從心所欲，不踰矩」。也可以說孔子少壯努力，老不踰矩，其三十歲後的四十年，發憤忘食，樂以忘憂的敎師生活，是足爲今日敎師的良好策勉。</p>
<p>孔子的偉大精神，千秋萬世，永永昭垂。</p>
<h3>孩子憂鬱的臉</h3>
<p>— 偉明</p>
<p>「爸爸，要繳學費了」。</p>
<p>孩子張大了鬱悒的眼珠輕輕地對我說。</p>
<p>是的，要繳學費了，我早知道這條鎖練會加到我的身上來的。但是，身爲父母者，於子女求學的問題怎能不聞呢，我對孩子說：知道了，爸會想法子的。</p>
<p>孩子走開去了。看着他那緩慢的脚步，和低垂着的頭，我想在他那顆小小的心裏也是和我一樣難受的吧。</p>
<p>穿起了皺的長衫，戴上了破的草帽，爲了孩子的前途，我在烈日的威勢之下，不得不作着數度冒險的嘗試！</p>
<p>然而，親友們的臉色都變了，看見我滿臉愁苦的走進去，他們正在嘻笑快樂的臉，也漸漸的變得愁苦起來。</p>
<p>「老兄，不瞞你說，我自己也正在想法呢」。</p>
<p>他們都這樣地「婉言拒絕」，一面還搖搖頭，嘆幾口莫名的氣，表示沒奈何的神色。</p>
<p>光潔的桌上，擺着冰凍的汽水和冰其淋，頭上吹着凉爽的電扇，他們的心，也許是凉了吧。</p>
<p>幾小時的奔走，長衫已透濕了汗水，我憤恨，我羞愧，現在，到那裏去呢。</p>
<p>回家去吧，——不，不回家，因爲，我怕看見孩子憂鬱的臉。</p>
<p>我躑躅在喧譁的十字街頭，茫茫然，像個無家可歸的流浪者！</p>
<p>傍晚，蒼茫的夜色中散佈着晚餐的香味，我饞涎欲滴，我飢火中燒，但我只以一角的代價，向路畔的茶攤上買了一杯凉茶來潤濕我的喉嚨。</p>
<p>夜了，天上閃爍着星子，我帶了疲憊的身，輕輕地溜進了家門。</p>
<p>孩子在破蓆上躺着，原來他已睡着了。望着那削瘦萎黃的臉，我有一種說不出悲凉的感覺。</p>
<p>我怕，我怕明天再看見孩子憂鬱的臉！</p>
<h3>自制</h3>
<p>— 海麟</p>
<p>自制是幸福和成功的本質，也是得到好的道德和人格的根源。</p>
<p>自制能幫助人用了恒心和莊誠去得到成功。</p>
<p>具備了自愛，自檢，自省，自持，自重的能力，才是眞正能够自制的人，能眞正自制的人，才能得到眞正的自由和愉快。</p>
<p>自誇，自欺，的人，永遠不會成功，永遠生活在不安定，不快樂的人生中。</p>
<p>我們要堅固自制力，必先做到二件事：一是謹愼自己的良心，二是要用慈善心思的精神，要想在任何偉大事業上成就的人，必需有把持自制的才能，一定要有嚴格的敎育和修養，直到他們能很穩定把握着自制。</p>
<h3>報名小記</h3>
<p>— 陳碧芸</p>
<p>一早，我領了二個孩子，十一歲的保，十歲的强，在愚園路口走着。我不知道六六八弄在那裏，只是眼看了路北的門牌走過去。</p>
<p>强先看見六六八弄喊了起來。於是我們走進了這弄口的柵門。弄很寬闊，地上鋪了柏油，很平坦。</p>
<p>柏油路走完，由於保曾來過的引導，向左一轉，又進了一道柵門，走上了同樣寬闊的碎石路。在這道柵門上，一株楊樹的後面，我看見了「同安邨」三字。</p>
<p>碎石路不過走了數十步，就到了同安邨的弄口，望進去，「集英中小學」的校牌，高高地橫懸在前面。</p>
<p>我感覺到，這地點的確淸幽</p>
<p>我們進弄向學校走去，從直掛着另一校牌的大門，到了校園裏，園相當大，可以作爲操塲，茸茸的碧草，還沒有感到一些秋意。</p>
<p>草地的北面，一排三開間的三層樓房，我似乎看見了什麼大學的什麽館。這樣寬宏的校舍，在弄堂學校」盛行的今日，的確是很少見的。</p>
<p>一走進中間的大門，便有人迎了起來，和靄地問我們，是否來報名，她是一個中年的女士。</p>
<p>由於她的邀請，我坐了下來，用「是」來回答了她，並且說明，我是看了報上的廣告和新聞，慕「集英」之名，而專誠領了孩子們來的，保擬入初中一，强小學六，還有一個沒有帶來『而四歲半的女孩愛，則擬入幼稚園、</p>
<p>我問她是否就是校長方培英女士，她承認了。她又介紹了幫她辦理報名手續而爲各者名雜誌寫稿的施濟美女士，</p>
<p>辦理報名手續時，我們談了好些話。値得一記的，　校長說，她要辦學校，不要辦學店」，她沒有錢，更沒有什麼津貼，一切經費，完全由她東拚西凑，從各友好方面借來的；因此，她的敎員，也不是爲了賺薪水應聘而來，乃是爲了志同道合，自告奮勇而來的。末了她說，請大家看　，她一定要辦成一個較合大多數有識人士理想的學校，她願意受這些人士的監督與指導。</p>
<p>報名完畢　，方校長又殷勤地領我們到樓上下各校室去參觀了一下。各敎室的明亮與寬暢，固然不必說，而校舍的西面便是一個大園，林木蔭醫，前面老遠才有較高的房子，掩映在高樹之間，也與人以不少美感。</p>
<p>在歸途上，我看着蹤蹤跳跳的保與强，深深　呼吸了一口氣。我爲孩子們讀書揀學校的事情，實在麻煩得够了，此後我可以免除這個麻煩了。</p>
<p>我信方校長的話是眞實的，我要看着。</p>

<p>何子興被主母詰責得無言可答，紅漲着險低着頭，躱到阿興背後去。維城見何子興已給葉二太太吆喝得不敢作聲，不便再怎麽樣發怒，他隨了葉二太太，走進屋子裏邊來道：　嬸娘，茶坊酒肆裏的話，果然不可盡信，但也是　根線索，我們應當去循着這根線索索一下才是。葉二太太道：「維城，你不要忙，我已經打定了主意，我到衛雲卿家裏去一次，當面間衛雲卿，我立刻就走。你們誰搖船？　當時阿興，何子興，徐金福都在門外，大家齊應一聲：「我去」！葉二太太道：　還是阿興吧，我到房裏去換衣服，阿興把船攏到前邊水橋上來。」（一六六）</p>

<h3>Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announces Second Solomon Islands Battle Results: US Giant Aircraft Carrier Heavily Damaged</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Domei News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM today that on August 24th, the Japanese naval air force launched an attack east of the Solomon Islands, heavily damaging a new-style US giant aircraft carrier, rendering it beyond repair. Another medium-sized aircraft carrier and a Pennsylvania-class battleship sustained lighter damage. On that day, a squadron of Japanese naval aircraft pursued a US fleet that had received reinforcements in the Solomon Islands area and immediately launched an air strike, repelling the enemy fleet. During the engagement, a small Japanese aircraft carrier was heavily damaged, and a destroyer was sunk. This campaign will be named the Second Solomon Islands Battle.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Domei News Agency) - The Pennsylvania-class US battleship, which was damaged by the Japanese Navy in the Second Solomon Sea Battle, has a displacement of 33,100 tons, was launched in 1915, has a speed of 21 knots, carries 1,358 personnel, and is equipped with twelve 14-inch guns, twelve 5-inch guns, eight anti-aircraft guns, carries 30 aircraft, and has two aircraft catapults.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 27th (Domei News Agency) - A dispatch from Washington reports that the US Navy Department announced on the 25th that a major battle has resumed in the Solomon Islands area.</p>

<h3>Unrest Continues in Various Parts of India</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Domei News Agency) - According to a dispatch from New Delhi, a statement from the Governor of the United Provinces of India stated that on the 19th, police in Lucknow opened fire to suppress demonstrators, killing seventeen people. Also, on the same day, eighteen people died in Patna, Bihar. It is generally believed that the actual number is even higher.

<p>London, 26th (Havas News Agency) - The Manchester Guardian published an editorial today reviewing the situation in India, stating that the arrest of leaders of the Indian National Congress is not enough to solve the Indian problem. Therefore, whether in India or in Britain, almost no one is satisfied with the measures taken by the authorities, and Britain's position has not been strengthened. In short, "There are not only many obstacles between Britain and India, but also a gulf has been drawn, separating each other. This situation is worse than it was a few weeks ago. At a time when we urgently need to concentrate manpower and material resources, and call on all who can assist us to cooperate sincerely, such an unfortunate incident has occurred, which is truly regrettable."</p>

At the same time, a large amount of military supplies was transported there.</p>

<h3>Turkish President İsmet Inönü Travels to Istanbul</h3>
<p>Ankara, 27th (Domei News Agency) - Turkish President İsmet Inönü returned here yesterday after inspecting Central Anatolia and the Black Sea coast and then left for Istanbul. At the same time, German Ambassador Papen arrived here on Tuesday from his summer residence in Therapia to discuss matters with Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu, who will fly back to the Turkish capital today. This trip by the Turkish President is of great importance, as it is widely believed to be closely related to the Turkish government's policy of ensuring the neutrality of the waterway between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. In view of the German army's advance in the Caucasus and the expansion of the war zone, Turkey's situation has become increasingly complicated. Yesterday was the twentieth anniversary of Turkey's victory over Greece. Turkish newspapers published articles promoting Turkey's spirit of independence. According to neutral observers, Turkey's neutrality policy has not changed, and Turkey will undoubtedly formulate appropriate measures to deal with the imminent emergency situation.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 26th (Central News Agency) - Today is the 20th anniversary of Turkey's recovery of lost territories and its war against Greece. Newspapers published articles stressing that Turkey should maintain its glorious independence. Neutral persons here recently pointed out the difficulties of Turkey's current situation and the Turkish government's policy to cope with it as follows: 1. It is rumored that the Soviet Black Sea Fleet seems to have escaped to Batum. Now that the general trend in the Caucasus has been decided, there are only two options for the Black Sea Fleet: one is to escape to Turkish waters for protection, and the other is to escape to the Mediterranean to merge with the Allied fleet. However, at that time, the Turkish government will adopt a neutral attitude towards the Black Sea Fleet's escape into Turkish waters. The Turkish president's inspection of the eastern waters this time is also an inspection of the defense situation. 2. After the Caucasus war situation became urgent, Britain immediately strengthened the defense of Iran and Iraq on the instructions of Churchill, appointed Wilson as the commander of the British forces in Iran and Iraq, and Linstead as the commander of the 15th Army in Iraq, refreshing the lineup of the guiding department, and at the same time mobilizing the Syrian and Palestinian troops in an attempt to strengthen the defense of Iran and Iraq. Turkey bears the brunt. There are Axis troops in the Balkans, and British troops on the eastern and southern borders. Since the outbreak of the Caucasus War, there has been a risk of major incidents in northern Turkey, so Turkey's situation is difficult, and the feeling is that there is no way to deal with it.</p>

<h3>Heavy Losses of Allied Ships: Serious Shipping Problems</h3>
<p>London, 26th (Havas News Agency) - Reuters recently published a dispatch from a correspondent in Washington stating that shipping problems are becoming increasingly serious. The progress of building new ships is far less than the number of ships sunk in the high seas by Axis submarines or aircraft. At the beginning of this year, thanks to Britain's efforts, all parties were very optimistic about shipping problems and hoped that they would improve by mid-summer of this year. Even the Allies could compensate for the losses before 1942. By this time, if no miracle occurs, the Allies will have fewer ships in all of 1943 than on January 1, 1942. In the past few months, the method of escorting merchant ships has been improved repeatedly, and the shipping problem has improved slightly, but the heavy losses suffered by the Allied side due to the Axis submarines' activity on the east coast of the United States have made the Allies suffer heavy losses.</p>
<p>Washington, 26th (Havas News Agency) - The Navy Department announced that a small Dutch cargo ship was sunk by a torpedo fired by an Axis submarine in the Caribbean Sea a few days ago. All rescued crew members have arrived at a port of a friendly country.</p>

<h3>German Courts at All Levels Will Be Reorganized: Dr. Schirach Speaks</h3>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Havas News Agency) - The new Minister of Justice, Dr. Schirach, told reporters today that the need for a thorough reform of our country's judicial administration has been a long-standing one. However, the spirit of German legislation will not change in any way, and courts at all levels must also be reorganized, but judicial independence must remain the same. Judges must still be free from domination, and their freedom of action must be expanded. As for the current state of the People's Court and the German Supreme Court, it is not intended to change them.</p>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - German Minister of Justice Schirach, who was ordered to draft a new German law, will be included in the powers granted to the head of state by the Reichstag on April 26, 1942. The head of state can use this power to require every German to fulfill his obligations. Those who violate it can be slightly fined. The "Frankfurter Zeitung" commented that every new era has its own laws. National Socialism is a revolutionary movement and cannot be an exception. The free laws of the 19th century focused on individual rights, while National Socialist laws should focus on the entire political, social and cultural aspects of the country.</p>
<h3>German Aircraft Bomb Greenland: Soviet Aircraft Attack Suburbs of Berlin</h3>

<h3>Large-Scale Tank Battles on Both Sides of Stalingrad: Red Army Takes Offensive in the Middle: Reportedly Advanced 45 Li</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 27th (Domei News Agency) - Large-scale tank battles took place yesterday northwest and southwest of Stalingrad. The threat to the north of the city is particularly severe because German tank formations and mechanized infantry units are crossing the Don River in large numbers, reportedly only 30 miles from the city. Millions of Red Army soldiers are preparing for a decisive battle to defend the city. Although the fierce battle has not yet arrived, it is not far away. According to a report from the Vichy radio station, on the southwestern front, the German army has passed Pishchnovka and is no more than 25 miles from Stalingrad. Also, according to yesterday's report, the Red Army suddenly took the offensive near the center of the Soviet Union and Kalinin. It is still too early to judge whether this new action is to divert German forces or a separate offensive. According to what was revealed in last night's Moscow special communiqué, this move was launched in the Lezhev area two weeks ago. The first blow has pushed the German army back 40 to 50 kilometers.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 27th (Havas News Agency) - The latest news from the Eastern Front is that the German army in the western district of the southern route continues to mop up enemy troops in the Taman Peninsula. Yesterday, it occupied a number of strongholds. At the same time, the German army is advancing towards the port of Anapa. Part of the Red Army in the port has withdrawn to Novorossiysk, but the port will be difficult to defend for long. At this moment, the German army is approaching a certain point where the Krasnodar Railway intersects in the southeast. On the Caucasus front, the German army occupied several mountain peaks. Moscow acknowledged that Grozny is in danger.</p>
<p>Bern, 26th (Havas News Agency) - The Basel News recently published a dispatch from a correspondent in Berlin stating that the important mountain passes in the Caucasus, from north to south, are now under German control. The most important of these are the following three: The Naibal Pass, which leads from Mount Elbrus directly to the north of the Black Sea port of Poti; The second pass, 70 miles east of Mount Elbrus, which leads from Malchick City directly to Kuts City; The third pass, the most important of them all, connects with the highway from Ordzhonikidze City to Tiflis City. According to news from Berlin, after the mountain troops under General Lanz occupied the peaks of Mount Elbrus, the German flag was hoisted in the high sky. Another German division is engaged in mopping-up operations in order to eliminate the remaining enemy troops. Another small team of mountain troops led by Captain Grotte set off from Chergassk City on the 13th of this month, preparing to go to the Mount Elbrus area to scout and annihilate the remnants of the Red Army in the upper reaches of the Kuban River. The army repeatedly clashed with the Red Army near the mountain foothills, that is, the Kuban River, and finally broke through the Red Army's position on the 15th and advanced into the isolated Wuxugarang City and began to climb high mountains. Also, because of the failure to find mules and horses, German soldiers carried weapons, ammunition, and food up the stairs. By the 17th of this month, they had climbed to a mountain 13,000 feet high and found the Soviet meteorological station there, which was still guarded by the Red Army. The garrison saw the sudden arrival of the German army and was caught off guard, and was disarmed by the German army. In the following days, the weather on the mountain was bad, and fire, wind, and snow occurred. After annihilating several Red Army teams, the German army continued to climb high mountains.</p>
<h3>German Forces Unleash Four Thousand Bombing Raids on Stalingrad, Enveloping the City in Smoke and Fire</h3>
<p>Soviet Border Region, 26th (Havas News Agency Dispatch) - Today marks the 439th day of the Soviet-German War. Amidst the grim realities, German forces are advancing on Stalingrad from both the northwest and southwest. The city is ablaze, thick smoke billowing everywhere. The dry grass on both banks of the Volga River has also been ignited by German bombing, and the city's factories and fuel reserves have been decimated by waves of enemy aircraft. It is estimated that the German side has deployed over four thousand aircraft, each conducting up to ten sorties day and night. According to German sources, the city's factories have already begun evacuation. Workers who have not been evacuated along with the machinery are participating in the construction of defensive works. German forces northwest of the city have severed the railway line between Stalingrad and Moscow. German forces in the southwest have also broken through Soviet lines. After thirty-six hours of close combat, Soviet forces have been forced to abandon their defensive line, which extends to a depth of twenty miles. These German forces are now only ten miles from the city. There are still some isolated pockets of Soviet troops behind German lines, but they have now been encircled. Although Soviet forces attempted to provide relief, they were repelled by the German forces. Soviet forces east of Kremskaya attempted to force crossings of the Don River on several occasions, but were repulsed by Italian troops. The general impression is that, although Soviet resistance remains strong, signs of exhaustion are beginning to emerge, and morale is wavering. On the Caucasus front, German Bavarian mountain troops have now occupied mountain peaks and are about to descend into the valleys of Georgia and Dagestan. All the passes in the Caucasus are only defended by Cossack cavalry, so the German advance has encountered no difficulty. In addition, Soviet forces in the mountainous region along the Black Sea coast from Tuapse to Novorossiysk have resisted fiercely. Soviet forces on the eastern shore of the Kerch Strait are still putting up a desperate fight while besieged, but it is only a matter of time before they surrender or die. It is still difficult to predict the future plans of the German High Command. However, the National Socialist Party's newspaper, the "People's Observer," recently published a map showing the route to Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, hinting at the possible German objective. Tbilisi is strategically important, being the key to the southern valleys of the Caucasus and a center for oil and manganese production. The German forces may wait for the fall of the port of Novorossiysk before advancing along the railway from that port to Batumi, in order to avoid the arduous mountain roads that would exhaust men and horses. The Soviet claim that German forces bombed Tbilisi is not confirmed. In the areas of Rzhev and Vyazma in the central sector, Soviet forces are constantly reinforcing the front lines with fresh troops, but have so far failed to break through the German defenses.</p>
<h3>Soviet Forces Vigorously Defend Key Positions, Hindering German Advance in the Caucasus</h3>
<p>German Führer's Headquarters, 27th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch) - This afternoon's German war bulletin stated that Soviet forces are fiercely defending key positions in the Caucasus in an attempt to halt our advance. West of Stalingrad, Soviet forces launched fierce counterattacks against the German vanguard, but were heavily defeated and repulsed. The German Air Force supported ground troops in combat, destroying forty Soviet tanks. Near Kaluga and Rzhev, enemy forces launched renewed attacks, but were driven back by German counterattacks. Northwest of Mtsensk, German counterattacks pushed the enemy back to their original positions. There were only localized battles around Leningrad. Forty Soviet artillery positions were destroyed by German assault troops. German fighter planes and anti-aircraft units shot down a total of 153 Soviet aircraft on August 25th and 26th. Nine of our planes failed to return to base.</p>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch) - Today's German war bulletin stated that German forces and their allies, despite fierce Soviet resistance and difficult terrain, continue to advance and have occupied several more key positions in the Caucasus mountains.</p>
<p>Moscow, 27th (Allied News Agency Dispatch) - The Soviet Information Bureau issued a war bulletin on the 26th stating that our forces engaged in fierce battles with German forces on the 26th southeast of Krasnaya, northwest of Stalingrad, northeast of Kotelnikovo, and south of Brovarky, Mostok, and Trakhanovski. Northwest of Stalingrad, our forces are preventing the Axis advance. Supported by the Air Force, the Axis forces are constantly launching fierce attacks on our positions. One of our units was subjected to as many as seven Axis attacks in a single day. Northeast of Kotelnikovo, our forces engaged in fierce battles with Axis tanks and infantry. There were localized battles on the Leningrad front.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 27th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch) - According to well-informed sources in London, Churchill is expected to report to the House of Commons on his visit to Moscow within two weeks.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 27th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch) - According to the London correspondent of the Swedish "Daily News," all discussions at the Moscow conference were based on the assumption that the Soviet Union would continue to fight this winter. The negotiations also took into account the fall of Stalingrad. While the fall of the city was recognized as a major blow to the Soviet Union, it was believed that Soviet forces could hold the Caucasus line. However, if German forces were to occupy the Baku oilfields, London believes that this would be a catastrophe for the Soviet Union. In addition to increased supplies of arms, Britain and the United States will also provide food. Allied special weapons in Iran will also be transported to the Soviet Union, but British and American troops will not be deployed in the Caucasus to assist in combat. However, tanks and aircraft will soon be transported to the Soviet Union. As for a second front, it is unlikely to materialize before next year, but by then, the number of German troops on the Western Front may double to about sixty divisions.</p>

British troop strength has also been increased. According to news from the capital of Iraq, Indian and Iraqi troops have been dispatched to the border between Iraq and Turkey to build fortifications.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 26th (Havas News Agency Dispatch) - According to the German "People's Observer," Britain is now trying to draw Iran into the vortex of war. In view of the deteriorating situation in the Caucasus, Britain and the Soviet Union are exerting great pressure on the Iranian government to take extreme measures, a move supported by the United States.</p>

<h3>Prominent Local Merchants and Philanthropists Organize Centralized Fundraising, Abolishing Separate Solicitations by Charities, with a Fundraising Target of Five Million Dollars</h3>
<p>The "Shanghai Times" reports that prominent Chinese merchants and philanthropists in the city are currently developing a plan to centralize fundraising for various charitable organizations and completely abolish separate solicitations by individual charities. Their initial fundraising target for the first six months is five million dollars. They have secured the support of the authorities in both the International Settlement and the Chinese-administered areas and have formed a Poverty and Disease Relief Association, which plans to start fundraising on September 10th. The new organization will not take over the activities of the city's many charitable organizations, but intends to raise sufficient funds during the fundraising period to distribute to relief organizations, orphanages, soup kitchens, and hospitals, and to provide assistance to educational institutions. This will allow the directors of these organizations to focus on promoting the welfare of those relying on relief. The charitable organization is led by a board of seven directors, and its working procedures are divided into five points: taking responsibility for the care of orphans, supporting hospitals, preventing epidemics with special facilities, subsidizing schools, and providing porridge and rice in the winter. It is expected that after the organization begins its work, its activities will expand to all aspects of charitable work and will also support foreign charitable organizations.</p>

<h3>The Salvation Army Begins Repatriation of Child Beggars; Child Beggars Account for the Largest Number of Inmates in Beggar Shelters</h3>
<p>The "Shanghai Times" reports that Major Walker of the Salvation Army recently told reporters that the Salvation Army, in cooperation with the city authorities, has recently begun repatriating child beggars. As of yesterday (August 26th), six child beggars had been repatriated to their places of origin. Each repatriation requires separate investigation, so while he hopes to expand this activity, it is quite time-consuming. Yesterday, two children were repatriated to Ningbo, including a sixteen-year-old girl who had been lured to Shanghai with the promise of a job, only to be sold into a brothel. Unable to bear the suffering, she escaped and, unable to return home, resorted to begging. She was sent by the police to the Salvation Army beggar shelter, which currently houses 370 beggars, of whom 350 are child beggars. The shelter has now installed a soybean grinder, which began operating yesterday and is able to provide soymilk to the child beggars.

<h3>Chinese Evacuation Committee Announces Work on Repatriating and Relieving Citizens; Investigations Are Strict, Application Procedures Are Swift, and More Than 2,000 People Have Been Repatriated</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Evacuation Committee is sparing no effort in its work to evacuate the population. It has been half a month since it began repatriating and relieving impoverished citizens of this city. In order to understand the actual situation of the committee's work, a reporter from the Datong News Agency visited Mr. Chen Junhong, a member of the Shanghai Municipal Council and director of the Chinese Evacuation Committee, yesterday. Mr. Chen received the reporter and made the following remarks:</p>
<p>Repatriation and Relief Work Carried Out Strictly</p>
<p>Since the Chinese Evacuation Committee began operating on February 9th of this year, it has always made the greatest efforts in its evacuation work. For example, in the past, half-price certificates were issued and groups of citizens were sent away. The committee has provided great convenience and assistance to citizens leaving Shanghai. This repatriation and relief work is merely another form of the committee's evacuation work. The motivation for this repatriation and relief work stems from the fact that there are many citizens in this city who wish to return to their hometowns but are unable to afford it. Therefore, the committee is extremely strict in its review of this repatriation and relief work. Citizens who are deemed to have good economic capacity are rejected, but in terms of all application investigation and approval procedures, the committee strives for speed so that citizens can leave Shanghai as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Increases and Decreases in Relief Funds for Group Submissions</p>
<p>Since the repatriation and relief work began on August 13th, more than 2,000 people have applied to the committee as of August 27th. The committee has completed investigations and approved more than 400 people, totaling more than 6,000 yuan. In recent days, more people have come to apply than before, and many groups, such as the Shandong Guild, the Hubei Native Place Association, the Xiangshan Native Place Association, the Three Religions Righteousness Association, and the Shaoxing Native Place Association, have also submitted a large number of applications. Most of the applicants are disabled, unemployed, and sick. Although the standard for relief funds is one-third of the total travel expenses, the committee, in order to adapt to the circumstances, can also carefully examine the economic situation of the applicants and make appropriate increases or decreases.</p>
<p>Deadline in One Month</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Chen solemnly told the reporter that the repatriation and relief work is scheduled for only one month and will end on September 12th. Impoverished citizens of this city who may not be aware of the repatriation and relief work should quickly go to the Chinese Evacuation Committee at No. 277, Fuzhou Road, Shanghai Municipal Council Building, to inquire about the details, otherwise they will miss the opportunity, which is very regrettable. The application procedure is extremely simple. After obtaining an application form from the committee and filling it out, it can be sent to the committee after being guaranteed by the head of the Pao or head of the Jia in the place of residence, confirming that the applicant is an impoverished citizen and is about to return to his hometown. After the committee investigates and confirms that the application is genuine, the appropriate relief funds will be issued.</p>
<h3>Lecture on Confucius' Teachings at the Grand Light Cinema</h3>
<p>— Xin'an</p>
<p>For five years, I hadn't stepped foot into the Grand Light Cinema. But since seeing the announcement of a special lecture to commemorate Confucius' birthday, I very much wanted to hear what Nakayama Kyūshirō had to say in his "Japanese Way and the Teachings of Confucius." Although I don't understand Japanese, fortunately there was translation, which increased my courage to attend. Around twelve o'clock, my son said to me, "If you want to go, you should go earlier. At your pace, walking to the Grand Light might take half an hour, and you might miss out because it's full." I thought that since it was a lecture on Confucius' teachings, and the Grand Light had many seats, it wouldn't matter if I went a little later. But unexpectedly, when I arrived in front of the Grand Light, the clock at the racecourse was pointing to half-past twelve. I had just entered the Grand Light, and indeed, there were many others arriving before and after me. After walking into the hall, from back to front, from left to right, I can say I went around once, and finding a seat was truly difficult. Finally, I managed to find a spot in the very last row, which was fortunate. In the venue, there were people ranging from babies in arms to those with full heads of white hair, those in short coats and long robes, and of course, women, young children, and youths. I then realized my son was right, and my own view was a mistake of the times; it was precisely because after the lecture, there was also a Great East Asia War film to watch.</p>
<p>With so many people, and many small children, those sitting in the back often heard the creaking of chairs as people stood up, and the sounds of children talking, which mixed in with the sounds of the lecture from the front. Although I concentrated intently on listening, I still couldn't hear everything clearly at times, which was somewhat disappointing for this trip.</p>
<p>Nakayama Kyūshirō's lecture lasted a full two hours, with detailed citations and thorough reasoning. Many points made me feel ashamed of myself. He generally said that Confucius's concepts of wisdom, benevolence, and courage (the so-called wisdom, benevolence, and courage, meaning being fond of learning is close to wisdom, practicing diligently is close to benevolence, and knowing shame is close to courage) and sacrificing one's life in danger, sacrificing oneself for benevolence, are in line with the martial spirit of Japan. Moreover, a certain Japanese general often encouraged his subordinates with "it is not courageous to fail to do what is right," showing that Confucius's thoughts and spirit have deeply penetrated the Japanese psyche. In addition, he talked about sufficient food and soldiers, and the courage of Zilu. Mr. Nakayama has indeed studied the books of Confucius extensively.</p>
<p>Secondly, he talked about Confucius' painstaking efforts to respect the king and his ideas of loyalty to the ruler, narrating them one by one, believing that Confucius never stopped thinking about honoring the Zhou dynasty and making it the ruler of the world for generations. He believed that honoring the unbroken imperial line and the Japanese people's loyalty and love for their country are in line with the spirit of Confucianism. He also solemnly encouraged us Chinese, saying, "Although China now has a different form of government, loyalty is still needed, that is, loyalty to the country." This is a summary of the main points of his speech. But China is trying to forcibly restrict the scope of the word "loyalty" to the two words "loyalty to the ruler," saying that Confucius's way of loyalty to the ruler is not in line with modern China, and using this as an excuse to overthrow Confucianism, even finding the word "loyalty" annoying to hear. This is truly ridiculous. One must understand that the character "ruler" (君) is composed of "尹" (yin, to govern) and "口" (mouth), meaning someone who speaks and issues orders, and does not necessarily contain the stench of emperors. Those with shallow views find "loyalty" inconvenient, but unexpectedly, Mr. Nakayama Kyūshirō has the same intention as our Chinese Sun Yat-sen in promoting China's inherent moral skills. He earnestly encourages us, which we should accept and be grateful for.</p>
<p>Speaking of the two characters "Zhongshan" (中山, Sun Yat-sen's name), I can't help but think back to a kind of commemoration of Mr. Sun's escape to Japan for the revolution. Today, Mr. Nakayama Kyūshirō also elaborates on the change of dynasty and generation through revolution, but he has his own standpoint.</p>
<p>Speaking of loyalty, it is connected to filial piety. Some say that loyalty and filial piety cannot coexist, and loyal ministers often come from families of filial sons. The Chinese value "filial piety," which I dare say no philosopher has ever dreamed of. As for the meaning of filial piety, not to mention the Classic of Filial Piety, it is also explained vividly in other classics. But forty years ago, the Chinese were stuck in the poison of xenophobia, seeing Western learning as worthless, indiscriminately rejecting it. And for the past forty years, they have been poisoned by "Western infatuation," regardless of whether it is good or bad, as long as it is "foreign goods," they say it is good without making any choice, and they say their own things are bad, discarding them all. It's truly like hiding a fortune ticket in a bamboo tube and throwing it into the river, striving to be different. They themselves are not filial to their parents, yet they want others to be unfilial. Why do they want to be like this? Because they think that filial piety is not talked about by Westerners, so they want to reject it. Alas, do you think that's pitiful or not!</p>
<p>Finally, he also talked about Shanghai being a major commercial port in East Asia, so he also talked about Confucius's economic thoughts, such as Zigong's "guesses are always right" and "there is a great way to make a fortune." He used the Biography of Merchants in the Records of the Grand Historian to prove the latter, drawing from Zigong. Indeed, Zigong played a role in allowing Confucius's way to be practiced in various countries. This shows the close relationship between economy and culture.</p>
<p>In short, Japanese people have their own central ideas in everything they do and learn. They never forget their own position and work hard. From this effort, they develop the spirit of establishing their country and dealing with the world. This is the strength of the Japanese nation and the weakness of the Chinese nation. Because the Chinese nation, although said to be the country where Confucianism originated, is fickle and lacks inner grasp. Nakayama Kyūshirō quoted Confucius, saying that if the Way is not practiced, he would take a raft and float out to sea. If he were to float to sea, the closest country would be Japan. Oh dear, is it really possible that Confucius's Way will go to Japan as he said? This is the shame of the Chinese! But how can the Chinese know shame? They still leave Confucius's teachings aside coldly. Those who don't understand the times want to advocate classics, and those who claim to understand the times often have never read the Four Books and Five Classics, and don't know what's going on. They learn the trends, pick up the scraps, and think that reading the classics is a corrupt and backward act. The Chinese claim to hold to the middle, but their thinking is always extreme, overcorrecting and not following the middle way, which is truly regrettable!</p>
<p>Nakayama Kyūshirō asks Chinese youth to accept the spirit of Confucianism. It is shameful to say that Chinese youth don't know what the Four Books and Five Classics are. Schools don't teach the classics, but the entrance exams for universities often have questions from the classics. We only know that teachers should "teach without discrimination," but unexpectedly, today's teachers are actually practicing "killing without teaching." Nothing is more ridiculous than this.</p>
<p>I read the Analects and the Four Books at the age of eight or nine, and the Spring and Autumn Annals and the Zuo Zhuan at the age of eleven or twelve. At that time, my older classmate also explained each chapter to me, and I had to review it every other day. But I didn't feel any benefit at all, only the difficulty. Later, when I went to school, I completed the so-called Five Classics as well. At that time, I had to read "Pullama" (probably referring to a foreign textbook) and learn arithmetic, mathematics, and algebra equations. It passed quickly, and I never had time to savor it. Later, after leaving school and entering the world, I experienced many things, and sometimes I used the Analects to relieve my feelings. Ah, it really surprised me why I didn't know its beauty before, but now I feel its meaning is profound. It truly fulfills Confucius' saying, "Reviewing the old and knowing the new." Why is it that he was born two thousand several hundred years ago and his words can still be applied to modern society? It shows that human academic thought has changed, but human nature and behavior still do not escape the original mold. I admire Confucius even more. How is it that in his short seventy-two or seventy-three years of age, what he said truly has the potential to be a "teacher for all ages"? His wisdom is truly unattainable. Zhao Pu used half of the Analects to govern the world. Not to mention half of it, if you can grasp a few words of the Analects, you can also benefit endlessly. This is not a compliment. Only those who have experienced this will know that my words are not wrong. Therefore, I advocate that every Chinese student should read a part of the Analects and select and read the Zuo Zhuan. Look, those who have outstanding achievements and contributions to the people are mostly those who are well-versed in the Zuo Zhuan!</p>

<h3>Commercial News: Active Investment Buyers, Chinese Stocks Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market moved forward very quickly. Zhabei Water &amp; Electricity surged sharply, rising 32 yuan, and the 1 yuan rise was the largest. China General Edison Company also rose 75 cents in the buying momentum. There was a shortage of sellers for Great China Match, and both Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company rose 2.5 yuan.

<h3>Mutual Observation, Bond Market Becomes Deadlocked</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the unified government bond market was quiet, and the fluctuations became increasingly narrow. This is because the large bull investors are still absorbing at low prices, while the sellers are observing and not moving forward due to the small increase. Therefore, both sides are deadlocked, both expecting a new development. As a result, trading turned quiet, and each bond caused a spinning pattern. At the opening in the morning, buyers first appeared active. Then each bond, carrying the firm momentum of the previous day, rose slightly again. After the opening, due to retail investors selling off one after another, the needs declined. Thus, it recovered downward. As a result, A and B each fell by 20 cents, C and E were unchanged, and D and F were in the opening stage. The trading volume was surprisingly quiet, only about 780,000 yuan. The list is shown below.</p>
<h3>Price of Gold and Silver Jewelry Unchanged</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of gold and silver jewelry in the Da Xin (大新) and Tong Hang (同行) jewelry stores in this city was still 2,150 yuan per tael at retail, with a reduction of about 300 yuan for purchases. The price among peers has stopped falling and tended to stabilize, due to a more active buying by a certain group. It was 1,875 yuan in the morning, the same as the previous day. Later, due to purchases by buyers, it rose to 1,890 yuan. Soon after, it dropped 10 yuan, to 1,880 yuan at noon, slightly higher than the previous day by 5 yuan, with a difference of only 15 yuan. The trading volume was sparse. As for silver jewelry, the price was still 16 yuan per tael, and the price among peers returned to 10 yuan and 89 cents.</p>
<h3>Military Tickets Firm and Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign currency market saw Japanese military tickets firm and slightly stable. The price among peers was 5 yuan, 5 cents, and 5.67 li (釐). The price sold at silver shops and money exchange shops was above 5 yuan, 5 cents, and 6 fen (分), and the purchase price was 5 yuan, 5 cents, and 4.5 or 5 fen, it is said.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate of the Money Industry Association was 1.2 cents unchanged, and the newly drawn head and cash were cleared at the same price, it is said.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Trading Is Very Limited</h3>
<p>Factory cloth: Yesterday's market was stable as before. There were very few differences in the selling offers of various cloths, and some even slightly increased the prices, but the trading volume was extremely light. For example, 16-pound Earth Coarse Cloth was 180 yuan, the same pound Bumblebee was 178 yuan, Flying Swan was 177 yuan, 9-pound New Character was 109 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong was 107 yuan, 12-pound Earth Fine Cloth was 160 yuan, Fugui was 151 yuan, Dapeng was 150 yuan, and Fugui Fine Twill was 128 yuan. The trading volume was very limited. There was not much change in poplin drill and bleached cloth. 士林 (Shi Lin) cloth was more active. The selling price of Little Chick was 249 yuan, and Peach Girl opened at 258 yuan in the morning, rising to as high as 259.5 yuan, and the closing price in the afternoon was 258.5 yuan, slightly up by 25 cents.</p>
<p>East Cloth: Yesterday's market was still in a state of spinning and holding, but the situation was very firm. Four Gentlemen Drill opened at 7 yuan and 26 cents, rose to 7 yuan, 33 and 34 cents. Retail investors sold more and bought less, and then softened to 27 cents. However, it was firm and strong again at the afternoon close, at 7 yuan and 29 cents, up 3 cents. The afternoon closing price of 12-pound Dragon Head Fine Cloth was 176 yuan, a drop of 50 cents. However, Colorful Ball Flying Fish and mid-to-low-end fine cloth continued to rise by 50 cents to 75 cents per bolt. Colorful Ball reached a high of 164 yuan, and the afternoon closing price was 163.5 yuan, still with demand exceeding supply.</p>
<h3>All Kinds of Velvet Are Popular</h3>
<p>Mohair, Sea White Dragon Velvet, Bear Hair Velvet, Sea Tiger Velvet, Rabbit Velvet, Lamb Velvet, Variegated Silk Velvet, Spiral Velvet, etc., have all been showing a strong trend recently. The market is strong, and the outlook is good. Incoming goods are even firmer, because the inventory in the industry is lacking, and people are optimistic. The autumn season is approaching, and sales are starting to move. Women's clothing makers have already been asking for samples. Also, because the inventory is low, and industry participants want to buy up anything cheap, the trading is active. The popularity of the market is the best in the recent velvet sector.</p>

<h3>Lanzhuzhi Orange Cakes Will Open This Afternoon</h3>
<p>The Lanzhuzhi (蘭竹枝) brought by the Lushan Maru and Jiantai vessels were already sampled yesterday. Not only is the quality sufficient, but the color and particles are also good. There are many small kernels, which is one of the advantages. The opening is scheduled for 2 PM this afternoon. Also, if the orange cakes can be transferred to the warehouse this morning, they can also be opened at the same time, it is said.</p>
<h3>Sugar Stockpile Gradually Thinning</h3>
<p>The sugar allocated to retailers for this month has now been completely sold out. The amount applied for September totaled more than 46,000 bags. The latest sugar stock totaled 244,000 bags, a decrease of more than 50,000 bags compared to the previous period. Coarse granulated white sugar is still the most abundant, followed by 20,000 bags of red sugar. The rest ranged from tens of thousands to several thousands of bags. Yesterday, the sugar stock market fluctuated slightly. The opening price for the coarse granulated sugar stock was 303 yuan, and the closing price was 302.5 yuan, down 50 cents. The red sugar stock rose instead, to 301.5 yuan, up about 4 yuan, due to the gradual shortage of goods. The total transaction volume was 1,300 bags.</p>
<h3>Hardware Transactions Quiet, Prices of Various Goods Stable</h3>
<p>The hardware market has been very quiet recently. The transactions in various routes are light, and the business of the stores is also sparse. Although the prices of various goods are affected by the insufficient stock in Shanghai, it is difficult to raise them. The standard selling prices are all stable.</p>
<p>Bamboo Section Steel Bars: Since the decline in the construction industry in this city, the route for 40-foot cement copper bars has been severely hit. To this day, it is still difficult to see improvement. Retail sales in stores are also sluggish. Therefore, those holding the goods have difficulty raising their minds, and the market has been stable for a long time. For example, 4-point patterned bars open at 11,500 yuan per ton, and 5-point to 1-inch goods are around 11,000 yuan per ton.</p>
<p>Black Iron Billets: Recently, the intake of 2,000-pound black iron billets by printing factories, billet factories, machine factories, and mirror factories has all decreased. At the moment, only retail transactions in stores are still trading. Wholesale transactions are insignificant. At the moment, the market atmosphere is such that selling feels difficult, and buying is also not easy. Therefore, the market is in a difficult situation for both buyers and sellers. As a result, the transaction is even rarer, and the market atmosphere is bleak. Colleagues' bargaining is still 6,000 yuan per bundle.</p>

<h3>The Spirit of Confucius</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>For thousands of years, the Way of Confucius has penetrated deeply into people's hearts. Based on the meaning of "reviewing the old and knowing the new," it is not a pedantic discussion to ponder and examine his teachings.</p>
<p>Confucius said: "My Way is one that runs through all." This consistent Way is called benevolence. Benevolence is the unified principle of morality. Confucius educated his disciples by focusing on moral practice. Only those who can establish themselves and others can be called gentlemen. The way of loyalty and forgiveness advocated by Confucius is also the morality of benevolence. Confucius valued trustworthiness: "Since ancient times, everyone has died, but a people cannot stand without trustworthiness." Trustworthiness is also a link in benevolence.</p>
<p>Confucius' autobiography: "At fifteen, I set my heart on learning; at thirty, I stood firm; at forty, I had no doubts; at fifty, I knew the mandate of Heaven; at sixty, my ear was attuned; at seventy, I followed my heart's desire, without transgressing the line." It can also be said that Confucius worked hard in his youth and did not transgress the line in his old age. His forty years of teaching life after the age of thirty, forgetting to eat and finding joy in forgetting worries, is a good encouragement for today's teachers.</p>
<p>The great spirit of Confucius will forever shine through the ages.</p>
<h3>The Child's Depressed Face</h3>
<p>— Weiming</p>
<p>"Dad, it's time to pay tuition."</p>
<p>The child said to me softly with widened, gloomy eyes.</p>
<p>Yes, it was time to pay tuition, I knew this chain would be added to my body. But how can a parent not care about their children's education? I said to the child, "I know, Dad will think of something."</p>
<p>The child walked away. Watching his slow steps and drooping head, I thought he must be feeling just as uncomfortable as I was in that little heart of his.</p>
<p>I put on my wrinkled long gown and donned my broken straw hat. For the sake of my child's future, I had to make several risky attempts under the fierce sun!</p>
<p>However, the faces of my relatives and friends changed. Seeing me walking in with a face full of sorrow, their faces, which had been laughing and happy, also gradually became sorrowful.</p>
<p>"Brother, to be honest, I'm also thinking of a way myself."</p>
<p>They all "婉言拒絕" (politely refused), shaking their heads and sighing inexplicably, expressing a helpless look.</p>
<p>On the clean table were iced soda and ice cream, and a cool electric fan was blowing overhead. Perhaps their hearts were cold.</p>
<p>After several hours of running around, my long gown was soaked with sweat. I was angry, I was ashamed. Where could I go now?</p>
<p>Go home—no, don't go home, because I'm afraid to see the child's depressed face.</p>
<p>I lingered on the noisy street corner, lost, like a homeless wanderer!</p>
<p>In the hazy evening, the aroma of dinner was spread, making my mouth water and hunger burn. But I only bought a cup of cold tea from a roadside tea stall to moisten my throat at the cost of a penny.</p>
<p>It was night, and the stars twinkled in the sky. I quietly slipped into the house with my tired body.</p>
<p>The child was lying on the broken mat, he was already asleep. Looking at his thin, withered, and yellow face, I had an indescribable feeling of sadness.</p>
<p>I'm afraid, I'm afraid to see the child's depressed face again tomorrow!</p>
<h3>Self-Control</h3>
<p>— Hailin</p>
<p>Self-control is the essence of happiness and success, and also the source of good morals and personality.</p>
<p>Self-control can help people use perseverance and solemnity to achieve success.</p>
<p>To have the abilities of self-love, self-examination, self-reflection, self-restraint, and self-respect is to be truly able to control oneself. Only those who can truly control themselves can obtain true freedom and joy.</p>
<p>Those who boast and deceive themselves will never succeed and will always live an unstable and unhappy life.</p>
<p>To strengthen our self-control, we must first do two things: one is to be careful of our conscience, and the other is to use a charitable spirit. Those who want to achieve greatness in any great career must have the ability to maintain self-control. They must have strict education and cultivation until they can steadily grasp self-control.</p>
<h3>A Small Note on Registration</h3>
<p>— Chen Bi Yun</p>
<p>Early in the morning, I took my two children, Bao, who is eleven, and Qiang, who is ten, and walked along Yu Yuan Road. I didn't know where Lane 668 was, but I kept an eye on the house numbers on the north side of the road as we passed by.</p>
<p>Qiang was the first to spot Lane 668 and called out. So we walked into the gate of the lane. The lane was very wide, and the ground was paved with asphalt, which was very flat.</p>
<p>After walking to the end of the asphalt road, guided by Bao, who had been there before, we turned left and entered another gate, stepping onto an equally wide gravel road. On this gate, behind a poplar tree, I saw the three characters "Tong An Village."</p>
<p>We walked only a few dozen steps along the gravel road and arrived at the entrance of Tong An Village. Looking inside, the school sign of "Ji Ying Elementary and Middle School" was hung high in front.</p>
<p>I felt that the location was indeed quiet and secluded.</p>
<p>We entered the lane and walked towards the school. Through the gate with another school sign hanging directly above it, we entered the campus. The grounds were quite large and could be used as a sports field. The lush green grass did not yet feel any hint of autumn.</p>
<p>On the north side of the lawn, there was a row of three-bay, three-story buildings. I seemed to see some hall of some university. Such spacious school buildings are indeed rare in today's world where "lane schools" are prevalent.</p>
<p>As soon as we entered the middle gate, someone came to greet us, asking us amiably if we were there to register. She was a middle-aged lady.</p>
<p>Invited by her, I sat down and answered her with "yes," and explained that I had seen the advertisements and news in the newspaper and admired the name of "Ji Ying," so I had made a special trip with my children. Bao intended to enter the first year of middle school, Qiang the sixth grade of elementary school, and my four-and-a-half-year-old daughter, Ai, intended to enter kindergarten.</p>
<p>I asked her if she was Principal Fang Peiying. She acknowledged it. She also introduced Ms. Shi Jimi, who was helping her with the registration procedures and writing for various well-known magazines.</p>
<p>While completing the registration procedures, we talked a lot. One thing worth noting is that the principal said that she wanted to run a school, not a "school shop." She had no money, let alone any subsidies. All expenses were entirely pieced together by her, borrowed from various friendly parties. Therefore, her teachers did not come to apply for a job to earn a salary, but came voluntarily because of shared aspirations. In the end, she said, please watch, she must run a school that better suits the ideals of most knowledgeable people, and she is willing to be supervised and guided by these people.</p>
<p>After completing the registration, Principal Fang enthusiastically led us to visit the classrooms upstairs and downstairs. The brightness and spaciousness of each classroom, of course, need not be mentioned, and the west side of the school building was a large garden, shaded by trees. Far ahead, there were taller houses, nestled among the tall trees, which also gave people a sense of beauty.</p>
<p>On the way home, I watched Bao and Qiang jumping and skipping, and took a deep breath. The matter of choosing a school for my children was really troublesome enough. From now on, I can avoid this trouble.</p>
<p>I believe Principal Fang's words are true, and I will be watching.</p>
<h3>Same Boat</h3>
<p>— Chao Xu</p>
<p>The world is dark, the earth is shaking;</p>
<p>The sea is vast, the road is long;</p>
<p>The wind is howling, the waves are surging;</p>
<p>The life in this small boat,</p>
<p>Even a strong man feels distressed.</p>
<p>…… ……</p>
<p>Comrades! Listen, look!</p>
<p>The big ship in front suddenly capsizes;</p>
<p>Friends! Listen, gaze!</p>
<p>The steamship behind also suddenly sinks.</p>
<p>…… ……</p>
<p>But you don't need to be sad, don't need to shout;</p>
<p>Don't panic, don't be dispirited;</p>
<p>With our skillful hands,</p>
<p>Calm minds;</p>
<p>Together, we shake out this gloomy atmosphere,</p>
<p>That treacherous waterway;</p>
<p>Aiming at our goal,</p>
<p>Strive to row forward!</p>
<h3>Words from the Bible</h3>
<p>— Yi Min</p>
<p>Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.</p>
<p>——Matthew</p>
<p>But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay:</p>
<p>——Matthew</p>
<p>Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but the instruction of fools is folly.</p>
<p>——Proverbs</p>
<p>The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death.</p>
<p>——Proverbs</p>
<h3>In the Same Boat Through Storms</h3>
<p>— Xiang Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(8) What Can Be Done</p>
<p>The news that He Zi brought was largely the same as the news that A Yu brought. The difference, so to speak, was that Fei Changhe himself, along with his wife and daughter, were all at Wei Yunqing's house. Only Bian Cuizhen was not at the Wei's house. She was said to be somewhere near Shanghai, or even farther away. Wei Cheng was originally full of anger, but hearing He Zi Xing say this, his face turned even redder. Madam Ye Er asked He Zi Xing, "Where did you hear these things?" He Zi Xing said, "When I arrived at Hua Gang, I sat down at a teahouse and ordered a pot of tea. I told people about the theft at our house. Two or three people were somewhat acquainted with Fei Changhe and said that Fei Changhe had been losing so badly these past few days that he had even pawned the felt hat on his head." Madam Ye Er said, "Don't beat around the bush. Who said that Miss Cuizhen had gone to Shanghai?" He Zi Xing said, "It was also said by a tea guest. I don't know him. He said that in this village, for hundreds of years, stealing women only happened when abducting brides. This isn't an abduction of a bride, so it must be either rape or sale. Fei Changhe has always been ruthless. If he didn't steal her to rape or sell, what else would he steal her for?" Madam Ye Er scolded, "Teahouses are places of rumor. Who is willing to take responsibility for what they say? Can you listen to these people's words? I didn't expect you to be even worse than A Xing, listening to people spout such nonsense and bringing rumors to deceive the young master, making everyone worried to no end."</p>
<p>He Zi Xing was speechless, rebuked by the mistress. His face flushed red, and he lowered his head, hiding behind A Xing. Wei Cheng saw that He Zi Xing had already been scolded by Madam Ye Er and dared not make a sound. It was inconvenient for him to get angry, so he followed Madam Ye Er into the house and said, "Aunt, what is said in teahouses and taverns is indeed not entirely believable, but it is still a clue. We should follow this clue and investigate." Madam Ye Er said, "Wei Cheng, don't rush. I have already made up my mind. I will go to Wei Yunqing's house and ask Wei Yunqing face to face. I will leave immediately. Who will row the boat?" At that time, A Xing, He Zi Xing, and Xu Jin Fu were all outside the door. They all replied in unison: "I will go!" Madam Ye Er said, "It should still be A Xing. I will go to the room to change clothes. A Xing, bring the boat to the front water bridge." (166)</p>
<h3>Hope</h3>
<p>— Bai Yu</p>
<p>There is no effort without hope.</p>
<p>Emerson</p>
<p>Hope is like the sun, which, as we journey toward it, casts the shadow of our burden behind us.</p>
<p>Smiles</p>
<p>Dispersion is not shameful; losing hope is truly shameful.</p>
<p>Lincoln</p>
<p>You can have a hundred failures, but never abandon your hope.</p>
<p>German Proverb</p>
