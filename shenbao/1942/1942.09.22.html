<p>Berlin, November 11th, Domei News Agency</p>
<p>The German High Command announced today that the German forces have captured the cities of Terek and Vladikavkaz on the Terek River front in the central Caucasus.</p>
<p>Berlin, November 21st, Havas News Agency</p>
<p>According to military sources here, Red Army infantry in the Voronezh area recently launched another attack on German forces with the aid of tanks, resulting in fierce hand-to-hand combat. The enemy briefly breached German lines at one point, but German infantry immediately filled the gap and annihilated the enemy. Southeast of Orel, enemy forces launched a heavy attack but were repelled. In the Zizdra area, enemy forces launched several local attacks. North of Erchifu, two German divisions have repelled 300 Red Army offensives over the past few weeks. The Red Army has lost 400 tanks.</p>
<p>Angora, November 21st, Haitong News Agency</p>
<p>According to the latest news from Moscow, fierce fighting continues in the ruins of Stalingrad. Hundreds of tanks lie buried in the rubble. German bombs rain down, turning the city into a hell. The fighting is particularly fierce in the northwestern part of Stalingrad, where virtually nothing remains intact. German pressure is increasing by the hour. Large fires and dense smoke are everywhere. Allied reinforcements have arrived to assist in the battle. German transport planes have also arrived with reinforcements. Soviet forces continue to attack at Voronezh in an attempt to relieve the siege of Stalingrad.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, November 20th, Havas News Agency</p>
<p>According to the Soviet Red Army newspaper Red Star, street fighting continues in the suburbs of Stalingrad, with the most intense fighting taking place in the northwestern suburbs. The two armies are only about 30 yards apart. Each offensive involves stabbing and hand-to-hand combat. One street changed hands four times in 48 hours. In some areas, German forces are still able to use tanks, allowing for swift movement and making defense difficult. In the overall battle for Stalingrad, German forces have a numerical advantage, with more machine guns and supplies delivered by air. The German air force still has the upper hand. However, the Soviet side has recently received a large supply of bombs and shells and is attacking enemy lines of communication west of the city with army units.</p>
<p>German Border, November 20th, Havas News Agency</p>
<p>According to a Red Army communique, German General Kleist has been killed in action on the Mozdok front. He was 61 years old and had dedicated his life to motorized warfare. In the 1940 campaign in France, he led his armored forces to break through the Maginot Line. In the 1941 Balkan campaign, he led his forces to capture the Yugoslav capital. He also achieved numerous successes since the start of the war against the Soviet Union, especially in the capture of Rostov.</p>

<p>Nanjing, November 21st, Central News Agency</p>
<p>In preparation for the visit of the Japanese special envoys, the Propaganda Department has printed and posted large slogans throughout the city and in shop windows, including "Welcome Japanese Special Envoys," "Revive China," "Defend East Asia," "Unite the Peoples of East Asia," and "Eradicate Anglo-American Influence." A decorated arch has been erected. The China Film Company is producing a special commemorative film of the Japanese special envoys' visit to China, filming along the route from the moment the delegation arrives in Shanghai. The film is expected to be released in Nanjing early next month.</p>
<p>Nanjing, November 20th, Domei News Agency</p>
<p>Nanjing Mayor Zhou Xuechang is rushing to prepare for the welcome of the Japanese special envoy delegation led by Hiranuma. Decorated arches have been erected on major thoroughfares, and welcome slogans have been posted in prominent locations. Upon the delegation's arrival in Nanjing, 6,000 students will be at the station to welcome them, and 30,000 people from political and business circles will participate in a parade.</p>
<p>Nanjing, November 21st, Central News Agency</p>
<p>To express its welcome for the visit of the Japanese special envoys, the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association will hold a lecture meeting at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Peace Hall, inviting special envoys Arita and Nagai to speak. The association will also send representatives to Shanghai to invite Dr. Mei Lanfang to perform in Nanjing to welcome the special envoys. Chinese music such as Peking opera, Kunqu opera, and Cantonese instrumental music will also be performed publicly. The association is currently finalizing the detailed program.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama's Statement <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Domei News Agency</p>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama, the Japanese Army Press Chief in Shanghai, solemnly stated today that the mission of the three special Japanese envoys visiting Nanjing is not merely a matter of diplomatic courtesy. Their main purpose is to exchange views between the leaders of China and Japan to promote cooperation between the two countries in order to establish a new order in East Asia. Hiranuma, Arita, and Nagai are all influential leaders in Japanese political circles. Hiranuma and Arita served as Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, respectively, when Mr. Wang Jingwei launched the peace and nation-building movement. Nagai served as the Director-General of the East Asia Department of the Taisei Yokusankai. All were able to influence Japan. The previous visits by Hirota to Thailand, Prince Takamatsu to Manchukuo, and this visit are all expressions of Japan's friendship with the three countries. Just as the previous visits by the delegations strengthened the ties between Japan and Thailand and Manchukuo, this visit will further strengthen the ties between China and Japan. He concluded by saying that Japan's friendly policy towards China has not changed since the China Incident. At the time of the incident, Japanese diplomacy formulated three principles based on justice, so that Japan, Manchukuo, and China would be the axis of world peace in the new East Asian order. These three principles are friendship, anti-communism, and economic cooperation.</p>

Floods and extreme heat were the hallmark of this operation. During this entire war period, all materials were self-sufficient. At present, the Japanese army has completed its expected goals, secured the newly occupied territories, and completed its strategic posture.</p>

<p>Tokyo, November 21st, Domei News Agency</p>
<p>Colonel Hiraiide, a spokesman for the Imperial Japanese Navy Press Department, gave a speech to 30,000 Japanese citizens on Friday evening, stating that the last time 10,000 US Navy personnel landed on the Solomon Islands, they were all wiped out. Strategically speaking, it is easy to annihilate the US military because their long-distance expeditionary reinforcements are difficult. This move should be seen as Roosevelt's political gesture, with the Navy as his sacrifice. Furthermore, former US Ambassador to Japan Grew underestimated Japan's latent power, saying that Japan was exhausted from the China Incident and that the US could put any pressure on Japan without Japan becoming indignant. This report was entirely based on Roosevelt's policy towards Japan. Now, Americans are gradually doubting the battle reports issued by their own country and are turning to believe the news released by the Imperial Japanese Headquarters.</p>

<p>Moscow, November 21st, Havas News Agency</p>
<p>Local radio announced that US President Roosevelt's special envoy Willkie is scheduled to meet with Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov today. Willkie is also preparing to meet with Chairman Stalin of the Supreme Defense Committee.</p>
<p>Moscow, November 21st, Allied News Agency</p>
<p>US President Roosevelt's special envoy Willkie, accompanied by US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Admiral Standley, arrived here yesterday by plane from Kuibyshev. Soviet Deputy Foreign Commissar Togonosov and British Ambassador Kerr and other dignitaries welcomed them at the airport. Willkie then told reporters that the opening of the Second Front had become a symbol of the Soviet people's perceived right to receive Anglo-American aid. He said that he had been asked about the Second Front issue no less than fifty times. In his view, the Stalingrad front is actually the Anglo-American front, as the nature of this war has become global. Willkie further stated that he came to the Soviet Union for two reasons: one, to convey a certain mission on behalf of President Roosevelt; and two, to inspect the actual situation in the Soviet Union in a personal capacity in order to report to the American people. He said that he would present a letter written in President Roosevelt's own hand to Stalin and planned to stay in Moscow for a week. After meeting with Stalin, he would go to the front line. In Kuibyshev, he inspected factories for sixteen hours in one day.</p>
<p>Istanbul, November 21st, Haitong News Agency</p>
<p>According to reports, US expert Bradley arrived in Moscow aboard an American bomber a few hours after Willkie arrived in Moscow yesterday.</p>

<p>French Concession Fire Brigade Drill</p>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that French Consul General Magre had notified residents of the French Concession yesterday morning that all equipment for the blackout must be prepared as completely as possible in the short term, as the air defense drill will be held from October 1st to 10th. Magre stated in his announcement that although the operation of general stores continued after the lights were covered in the previous air defense drill in the French Concession, some residents inevitably slackened off their work due to the blackout. The start and end of the drill will be broadcast on the XQHA radio station (900 kHz frequency) as stipulated by the Air Defense Supreme Command. As for the Shanghai Municipal Council, it also issued a similar notice yesterday morning. During this ten-day exercise, the French Concession Fire Brigade will be dispatched at any time to practice. Every residence has been notified to store water in preparation for assistance when necessary. When the alarm sounds, the first team will immediately depart to the police station to await orders for rescue. Doctors will also go to their designated hospitals or health centers to provide rescue. Public lighting will be controlled in accordance with special notices, and private lighting must be covered by citizens with black cloth.</p>

<p>About 1,000 Polish Emigrants Plan to Retreat, English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that the United Polish Emigrants Association of China issued a notice the day before yesterday that all Polish emigrants in the city should register by Wednesday. According to Mr. Tom Swan, Chairman of the group, this registration is only driven by normal purpose and is not intended to evacuate emigrants. It is said that there are about 2,000 Polish emigrants in the city, about half of whom are refugees. Tom Swan believes that this measure will also be useful for the possible evacuation of Polish emigrants in the future. According to previous reports, about 1,000 Polish emigrants in Shanghai plan to evacuate.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Expand the Scope of Evacuation of Coffins in the City <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Spreading to various places in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the Guo Hua Coffin Transport Department negotiates.</p>
<p>Since the incident, more and more coffins have accumulated in the city. Funeral homes, public offices, funeral parlors, and material coffin houses are full, making it impossible to evacuate them for a while, which is a major obstacle to hygiene. The relevant authorities in the city attach great importance to the Guo Hua Funeral Home, which was ordered to establish a Coffin Transport Department to handle the evacuation of coffins. The trial evacuation of coffins in various places in eastern Zhejiang has been underway for several months and has achieved remarkable results. Therefore, recently, various hometown associations, public offices, and material coffin houses have suggested to the department to expand the scope of evacuation. Because the evacuation work in eastern Zhejiang has become increasingly busy recently, the department has been unable to carry out the expansion for a while, but all parties are urging it very urgently. The department will first start the evacuation of coffins from Kunshan, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Jiaxing, Hangzhou, Yangzhou and other places. Needy coffin relatives can still apply for free or reduced-fee transport. Contact can be made at No. 2, Lane 96, Jing'an Temple Road (i.e., the east end of the Jinmen Hotel).</p>

On the Jinpu Line, an additional passenger train will be added between Pukou and Bengbu. Also, the passenger train that originally ran to Xuzhou will be extended to Tianjin South. On the Nanjing Line, two additional round trips will be added between Nanjing Zhonghua Gate and Nanjing New Guomin Station (formerly Weixin Station) to facilitate travel and avoid congestion. As for freight transport, large locomotives have also been selected on each line to provide services to strengthen the transport of important materials.</p>

At that time, it is hoped that the general public will not be alarmed and mistakenly believe that it is an air raid alarm.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, considering the multitude of factories within the concession, and although there were industry guilds, there was still a risk of isolation from the Council, issued a general order to its police stations to convene and organize industry group liaison meetings. The area was divided into units corresponding to each police station's jurisdiction to facilitate mutual contact. The Xinzha Police Station immediately began to implement this, issuing notices to all factories within its jurisdiction to send their representatives to the station on the 20th of this month at 10 a.m. to register and attend the meeting. Although the majority did so, many were missed or did not attend. Therefore, the persons in charge of all factories in the Xinzha district, from Maite Hesituo Road in the east to Yu Qiaqing Road, north to the Suzhou River, and south to Jing'an Temple Road, are requested to register immediately at Room 3, Special High Section, of the Xinzha Police Station to facilitate all arrangements.</p>

<p>The Japanese Supreme Command in Shanghai announced yesterday that nationals of countries at war with Japan or that have severed diplomatic relations with Japan, with the exception of children under the age of twelve, must wear a red armband. The list of 34 countries that must comply with this regulation was announced by Mr. Masaki, Director of Translation at the Japanese Consulate: United States, United Kingdom, Northern Ireland, New Zealand, Canada, Australia, Union of South Africa, Haiti, Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Dominican Republic, Cuba, Panama, Netherlands, Belgium, Mexico, Poland, Egypt, Greece, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Uruguay, Iran, Iraq, Norway, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Reasons for Delay in Repatriation of Nationals from the Americas <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>No Repatriation Ships from the Americas</p>
<p>The repatriation of nationals from the Americas remains unresolved. Although the governments concerned have reached agreement in principle on various issues, the practical difficulties are proving difficult to overcome. The Japanese Consulate General, the Swiss Consulate, and the Nationals Association in Shanghai have not released any information on this matter in the past week or two. While the Conte Verde has arrived in Shanghai from Japan, the Italian shipping company has refused to confirm whether the ship will continue to be chartered to repatriate nationals from the Far East to the Americas. As a result, there has been no official confirmation that the repatriation of Americans will take place next month. However, according to well-informed sources, the main reason for the indefinite delay in the exchange of nationals between the Americas and Japan is the scheduling of ships. Based on current indications, Japanese nationals in the Americas will not be able to obtain suitable ships from the authorities to transport them to the Americas in the short term. Therefore, regardless of whether the Japanese authorities have ships available in the Far East, the departure of Americans will inevitably be postponed. As a general rule, ships repatriating nationals from the Far East must depart one week after the ships repatriating nationals from the Americas have set sail, because the voyage from Yokohama or Shanghai to East Africa via the Suez Canal is longer. In fact, the continued requisition of the NYK liner Kamakura Maru and the possibility of the Conte Verde continuing to be chartered are both subject to negotiation, so the repatriation of nationals has had to be significantly delayed. To date, American nationals in Shanghai have not received official notification of their repatriation.</p>

<h3 id="e36">Government Bond Market Conditions <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was still considerable activity in the over-the-counter trading of government bonds, but the black market trading was inevitably chaotic and inconsistent. Market conditions generally rose first and then fell, probably because many parties slightly emerged to take profits as prices had risen too sharply. Furthermore, it was difficult to find counterparties for over-the-counter transactions and the sharp increase prior to holding considerable capital positions was similar to today's sudden drop. It is expected that the market will formally convene and reorganize after the Mid-Autumn Festival. Yesterday, the price of Category C bonds rose as high as 6.90 yuan, but then fell to as low as 4.70 yuan due to profit-taking by the bulls, before recovering to around 5 yuan. Category B bonds fell the most, by 1.5 yuan, with a final price of 2.5 yuan. Other categories also experienced small declines of a few jiao to one yuan. The volume of transactions was not large and is therefore omitted. There were many changes in the market with fierce competition, so let's wait and see what happens.</p>

<p>Regarding the subsequent movement of goods by Chinese merchants and applications for certificates of entry and exit, it has been stipulated that each company, factory, or firm should first report to its respective industry guild, which will then certify it to the Chamber of Commerce, which will then issue the certificate.

<h3 id="e45">Fun Quiz: Among the Four Great Beauties (Jade) of China Union, Whose Teeth Are the Most Beautiful? <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Gu Lanjun, Chen Yunshang, Chen Yanyan, and Yuan Meiyun are known as the Four Great Beauties of China Union. Now, we are not talking about anything else here, but specifically asking which of the Four Great Beauties is the most beautiful, which should be ranked first, which should be ranked second, which should be ranked third, and which should be ranked fourth. Movie fans must pay special attention to the smiles and frowns of the stars, so this question is publicly soliciting answers from readers. At the same time, in order to increase interest, the Shanghai Clean Teeth Institute will give a 10-yuan cleaning voucher to readers who answer correctly, entitling them to a free cleaning, but this is limited to ten vouchers. If more than ten people answer correctly, the winners will be determined by lottery. Those who do not win will also receive exquisite publications. Please send your letters to the Advertising Department, Shanghai Clean Teeth Institute, Jinshan Hotel Storefront, Guangxi Road, Shanghai (the answers will be published in this column in the next issue).</p>

<p>An Unclean Tooth Can Sacrifice Your Life An American saying: "An unclean tooth can sacrifice your life." The deaths of Zhao Songmou of Wujin and Mrs. Kujo Takeko (Ki) of Japan, among others, who died of dental diseases, are proof of this, which makes it even more believable. It can be seen that oral hygiene is indeed of great importance to physical health. However, attention to oral hygiene must be practiced through scientific teeth cleaning in order to eliminate germs and prevent dental problems.</p>
<p>Chinese People Suffering from Dental Diseases Account for 87 Percent According to specialist dentists, 87 percent of Chinese men over the age of thirty suffer from dental diseases. Among them, 18 percent have four diseased teeth, 26 percent have three diseased teeth, 29 percent have two diseased teeth, 16 percent have one diseased tooth, and 8 percent have five to eight diseased teeth. Only 13 percent have completely healthy teeth.</p>
<p>There are Clean Teeth Institutes Everywhere in Southeast Asia According to Southeast Asian returnees, there are Clean Teeth Institutes everywhere in Southeast Asia. In Singapore alone, there are already as many as six Clean Teeth Institutes (called "teeth washing institutes" locally), and each one is bustling with customers and business is extremely prosperous. The attention paid by the locals to dental hygiene can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Scientific Teeth Cleaning Has Become a Fashionable Trend After Shanghai Clean Teeth Institute Expanded Its Promotion on Jinshan Hotel Storefront, Guangxi Road, it has aroused a general awareness of "scientific teeth cleaning." In recent days, the ladies who go to the clinic for teeth cleaning are in an endless stream. It can be seen that scientific teeth cleaning has become a fashionable trend in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Zhou Manhua Cuts Ribbon at Opening of Shanghai Clean Teeth Institute <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>On the opening day of the Shanghai Clean Teeth Institute, the movie star Miss Zhou Manhua was specially invited to hold the ribbon-cutting ceremony. When the movie fans heard the news, they rushed to the clinic to see the star's beauty, causing a sea of people on Guangxi Road and disrupting order for a time. (Juting)</p>

<p>Scientific Teeth Cleaning Absolutely Does Not Damage Enamel</p>
<p>Some people think that scientific teeth cleaning is washing teeth with chemicals and that it may damage the enamel of the tooth surface. In fact, this view is completely wrong. You must know that scientific teeth cleaning and chemical teeth washing methods are completely different. Strong chemicals do damage the tooth surface, but scientific teeth cleaning absolutely does not use chemicals. It is based entirely on special medical and scientific methods, such as using various different teeth cleaning instruments and electric brushes to scrape off tartar and calculus. This method does not damage the enamel of the tooth surface at all. Therefore, we should have a clear distinction and special understanding of scientific teeth cleaning and chemical teeth washing.

<h3 id="e49">Scientific Teeth Cleaning Receives High Praise from Various Newspapers <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Clean Teeth Institute expanded its promotion, the matter of scientific teeth cleaning has not only aroused close attention from all walks of life, but has also won unanimous praise from major and minor newspapers. For example, the "News Report Teahouse" once published an article on the importance of teeth cleaning, praising scientific teeth preparation. The "Shen Bao" on the 11th published a Shanghai Clean Teeth Institute interview note, believing that the content of the clinic had a very good impression. Other newspapers such as the "Shanghai Daily" also gave high praise. (Yu)</p>

<p>Miss Li Hao's hygiene mailbox is very popular. Now the Shanghai Clean Teeth Institute also intends to set up a mailbox, named "Dental Hygiene," to be answered by Miss Li Hao, a female dentist at the clinic. Miss Li is a top student of dentist Huang Bingyu, with profound knowledge and rich experience. She is especially proficient in literature and will answer questions about dental problems from all walks of life in the future with a relaxed and fluent style of writing. (Shui)</p>

<p>— Zhi Hu</p>
<p>The day after tomorrow is the Mid-Autumn Festival. The Mid-Autumn Festival is a joyous occasion. It is said that city dwellers have a particularly keen sense of the seasons. In reality, this is due to the different environments each person is in. For example, the early launch of mooncakes is not due to merchants' special affection for the August moon. The key to success in commercial warfare lies in innovation and changing with the times. In other words, seizing the lead is victory. Looking around, the so-called market in recent years is within their grasp.</p>
<p>The wealthy plan how to use any excuse to enjoy themselves when a festival approaches. Conversely, the opposite is naturally to use some kind of excuse to escape this difficult situation. Every festival, we also see articles that advise people to save and avoid extravagance, achieving two goals at once. But the advisors advise themselves, and the listeners do not hear. Saving and avoiding extravagance are not limited to festivals. Moreover, the advisors' incessant nagging makes people turn a deaf ear. Just as thinking of relatives is inevitable during festivals, it is also similar to selling mooncakes in autumn. It is almost philistine. Saving can be done at any time, and thinking of relatives can be done every day. Instead of advising others, start with yourself.</p>
<h3 id="e52">On Treating the Root Cause of Illness <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Ying</p>
<p>When sick, one must seek treatment. Treatment must be swift for a quick recovery and to restore one's original health. Otherwise, one will face extinction and death.</p>
<p>However, treatment must also be appropriate. To simply cut out the rotten flesh without injecting serum for a festering wound is not enough. The surface may appear temporarily better, but the toxins will still reactivate and cause recurrence in the future.</p>
<p>In short, a good doctor will first investigate the cause of the illness and then treat the root. If one simply treats the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts, then one is a mediocre doctor.</p>
<p>Last year's unfortunate incident where a tram conductor pushed a passenger to his death seems to have been resolved, and the culprit was punished. However, if the company authorities actively distributed the conductor's tedious workload (by adding ticket sellers at the doors, etc.) and seriously considered improving the workers' compensation (to ensure their peace of mind and loyal service), then how could the unfortunate incident of the eighth of this month (see this newspaper's fifteenth-day news), where conductor Xia Qiaosheng insulted and even pushed passenger Zhu Yaoliang, causing his right foot to be crushed by the train wheels, recur this year?</p>

<p>— Tang Ning</p>
<p>Mr. Li left early in the morning. It is said that he left in a fit of pique, so Mrs. Li looks very upset.</p>
<p>The eleven-year-old child put on his blue cloth gown, ready to pay the tuition fees, because school starts today.</p>
<p>We can't even afford food, so what's the point of studying? Mrs. Li, irritated by the child's pestering, slapped him. The child shrank to the corner of the bed and cried, soaking a large patch of the gown with tears.</p>
<p>Like Aji next door, who can sell two baskets of stir-fried beans every day and earn four or five dollars, you're as old as him and have studied for three years. What good is it? The more Mrs. Li spoke, the angrier she became, as if she wanted to throw the two-year-old daughter she was holding while breastfeeding out the window.</p>
<p>Mrs. Li is already anxious enough. Her seven-year-old child is sick and has not seen a doctor. Today is Saturday, and there are still four and a half liters of household rice to be collected. The couple argued last night, and this morning he left in a fit of pique. I don't know if he will come back tonight.</p>
<p>The early autumn sun has climbed from the large ears of the fire wall onto the bed. Outside the door, peddlers' cries can be heard.</p>
<p>"Broken cloth for red sand beans." The voice floated in the wind. Mrs. Li's heart stirred. "What are you crying about, son? Take some scraps of cloth to exchange for beans."</p>
<p>The beans were exchanged, and the child peeled and ate them. Mrs. Li put down her daughter and peeled and ate them too.</p>
<p>"Mom, what are you eating?" The seven-year-old sick child also woke up and stretched his neck. "You can't eat this. I'll give you meat floss porridge when Dad comes home."</p>
<p>"Dad... when will he come?"</p>
<p>There was no answer. Mrs. Li just tilted her head, and tears flowed like beads from a broken string.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Reunion <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Li</p>
<p>Some people praise Qin Shouou's "Autumn Begonia" as the most powerful, vivid, and dramatic section of the book is the reunion of Luo Xiangqi and her daughter, Mei Bao. I recently saw this book as well, and this strange and tortuous story indeed moved me to tears.</p>
<p>Life is inherently a tragedy, and the elements of joy are simply too few. For example, the separation and reunion of two of the closest people should be a very happy thing. However, the environment at the time of reunion is often so awkward and so unbearable to recall. Even when mother and child cannot recognize each other, or when they have a bellyful of longing but no way to utter a word, what heart-wrenching pain is this?</p>
<p>When I was six years old, I said goodbye to my beloved second sister. A full twenty-one years passed without seeing each other. After the war, I finally met her husband in Hong Kong and learned that she was in the hospital giving birth. The next morning, I rushed there, but she was breathing her last breath due to complications in childbirth. That day, I almost fainted in front of her sickbed.</p>
<p>Life is full of worries. Even a scene of reunion of flesh and blood is often not necessarily joyful.</p>

<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(9) Human Hell</p>
<p>Taking advantage of Wei Yunqing's loosening grip, Mrs. Wei twisted her body and walked outside. Wei Yunqing was not about to let her go easily, so he reached out and grabbed her hair, which was as brittle as a coal ball, and said, "Where are you going? You make the house a joke, as if there's no master, with everyone doing their own thing. Having a mother like you has led to a rebellious son like Shaoyun." Mrs. Wei didn't have much hair to begin with, and couldn't withstand Wei Yunqing's grip. She took a step back, feeling a pain that went to the bone, and shouted, "Help!" Then she fell backward. Wei Yunqing didn't show any pity and let her fall. With a thud, she fell to the ground. He snatched a rattan whip from the wall like a mad dog and whipped Cao Ma's thick cotton trousers, which were as thick as a quilt. Then he rushed over and whipped A Si's back, which was bent like a bow, and shouted, "Where is it? Where is it? You say it or you're dead. Even if I beat you to death to pay for it, you'll still die before me." As he said this, he whipped A Si's back again with the first and third whips.</p>
<p>The room was obviously chaotic. Wei Yunqing suddenly seemed ten years younger and jumped around, shouting in the courtyard, "Rebellion! Rebellion!" More than a dozen people, tall and short, stood in the courtyard, all of whom had eaten their share of bitterness and were working like beasts of burden for Wei Yunqing. When Wei Yunqing came out, they hurriedly retreated a few steps and shrank to the side. Wei Yunqing called out, "A Si, come here." A Si walked out. Wei Yunqing grabbed his hand and turned everyone, from top to bottom, inside and outside, in Wei Yuanwai's house upside down to search. But they couldn't find Bian Cuizhen and Wei Shaoyun. Wei Yunqing went to the small courtyard in the west, where Cuizhen had been confined before. Seeing that there was no one else around, he changed his expression and said, "A Si, you know where the young master is. Tell me. If you tell me, how much reward do you want? I'll agree to it immediately. If you want a hundred, it's a hundred. If you want two hundred, it's two hundred. It won't be like before, where I didn't keep my word. If you want to marry a wife, I'll find a way to borrow money for you, and the interest will be as low as it can be. I hit you just now out of anger. Now that I think about it, you're actually a good person." A Si was surprised to see Wei Yunqing softening towards someone like him for the first time, and felt flattered. He first scratched his head, then smiled and said, "Master, I really don't know where the young master is." Wei Yunqing said, "No one knows his son better than his father. I know that rebellious son's temper. I should find Miss Bian soon, and I can't delay any longer. Even if I find her, it's no use. A Si, watch me, Master, kneel down to you." Wei Yunqing was simply a great man who could bend and stretch, and knelt down on both knees. (183)</p>
