<h3>寇爾許半島　進行大戰　雙方損折均重</h3>
<p>倫敦十三日路透社電希特勒行營今日特別宣布、德軍殲滅寇爾許半島之蘇方守軍、其他消息則傳進攻之軸心軍正與柯慈洛夫將軍部下蘇軍進行大戰、查去歲十二月收復該半島之蘇軍、即係柯慈洛夫所指抓者、紐約時報今日之熊城訪電稱、德軍勁旅　由坦克車與飛機協助、似已在從坦干洛格迤西起。向北至期達林諾與貝特洛巴夫列夫卡折向西至聶普洛特洛夫期克之綫各點、展開四五次攻擊、然僅在貝特洛巴夫列夫卡鄰近稍獲進展、此區蘇軍已退三哩、雙方損折均重云、今日蘇方之中午公報仍以一昨夜前綫未發生要事」爲言、其補充公報則謂、南部與西北部前綫蘇軍略有活動、未述及克里半亞戰事、父據莫斯科電臺廣播、寇爾許半島昨激戰終日、至今仍在進行中區衆信蘇德雙方均派大軍作戰、德方集有大隊騎兵、坦克車及步兵、其中並包括羅·義兩國軍隊、莫斯科方面表示、紅軍有擊敗德軍迫近高加索企圖之把握、</p>
<p>柏林十三日哈瓦斯社電此間軍界人士稱、寇爾許區域大戰、尙不能認爲德國春季攻勢之開端、該區域戰事範圍有限、目標早經決定、換言之、德軍擬在該處獲得優勢、以便發動更大之攻勞、惟此役關係仍極重要、蓋德軍一旦勝利後、紅軍即將喪失戰略上的一跳板區域、」勢將無法藉此反攻、以收復克里米亞、果爾、則紅軍在該區所築防禦工事、以及該區之天然屏障、均將歸德軍所有、查一跳板二詞、並非新創、凡陣地較窄、而空防設備密集、其他軍隊力能猝然集中、敵軍左近區域者即是、紅軍員額雖多、但德國及其各與國則以十兵訓練有素、配備精良自豪、德軍並當完全利用新式武器、要之、現行戰事業經長期準備、故非等間可比、</p>

<p>本報特稿</p>
<h3>阿拉斯加公路　（五）</h3>
<p>自去歲三月以來，管家的太太們，還替國家做了一件挺太的工作，那就是把家裏不需要的鋁器，一齊捐給國家。這是製造飛行保堡壘之類最需要的原料，而且對於太太們又是惠而不費的一件功德。去年的雜誌日報，常有這一類運動的成績照片與統計報吿刊載出來。這個統計到了現在，恐怕難以數字形容了。</p>
<p>至於其他如農人，工人，學生，等等如何動員，記載很多，也勿庸我們多事嘮叨。就是失業的民衆，現在也差不多都由失業組織機關把他們一批一批分別安揷了。這都是旣繁且瑣的勾當，也是需要相當時日安排的。</p>
<p>但是近幾個月新的事態不斷的發生出來，運輸的困難也因之日漸增多，譬如以前美船可以直達海參崴，近來就辦不到，只好繞道印度而經近東轉遞目的地，最近連印度也不大方便了，那怎麽辦？</p>
<p>數月之前，美人未嘗沒有看到這一點，因此有建築阿拉斯加公路的計劃。可是始終有一點，我們須得明瞭，那就是本次的所謂世界大戰，其重心不在太平洋，乃在大西洋和　陸。不問讀者讚成這個主張與否，英美軍政兩界，確實是如此安排而實地在進行着。所以，阿拉斯加公路的建築，與其說是。種戰略關係，還不如說是對蘇聯的運輸，在另闢一條蹊徑，然而其中最微妙的一點，即美人的注重點在阿留西安羣島直達堪察加，而不在白令海峽上。這倒是耐人玩味的一點。</p>
<p>爲了要說明阿拉斯公路，而提起了美人爲何此時才想起了建築公路；爲了要解釋這個問題，因而牽扯到了美國的共他一切。這好像是拖累閱讀者無端繞了一個大圈子；愧對得很。現在且說一點關於　條公路的來根去由吧。</p>
<p>這條公路，與其說是一個時勢問題，還不如說牠是一件現代史料·原來在一九叫一年二月，英美兩國當局會議一番之後，就決定把加拿大的航空路綫加長一些。長到什麽地方呢？就是阿拉斯加的西邊海濱，如若可能的話，就沿西伯利亞直達蘇聯。</p>
<p>這條航空路綫的起點，一在英國的倫敦，一在美國的華盛頓。這兩點的交又會合處，就在前文說過的紐芬蘭島上。由紐芬蘭到寇伯克，照航空錢說，只有一望之地，十來分鐘的飛行罷了。由寇伯克到溫尼伯再到厄德夢吞，那是一大段；再由厄德夢呑而達納爾遜堡，而華特生湖。如再向西，那就是阿拉斯加的巾心費爾班克了。</p>
<p>可是有了航空綫，就不能不沿綫建築公路。山寇伯克到厄德夢吞，早有了橫貫大陸的鐵道，一點也不用費事。由厄德夢特到納爾遜堡，也有可能的運榆公路，河道等。但自此處往西往北，轉句文來說，便是「冰雪蓋地，一望無圾。」</p>
<p>自從航空綫的議案決定後，美國交通部便把這段工程，交託厄德夢特的西方建築公司和溫哥華的總建築公司進行；一個建案納爾遜堡飛行塲，一個建築華特生飛行塲。公路方面，兩家合作。苦的是這兩個地段，離開最近的鐵道站，都有三百哩路之遠。好在戰事一畢，就是天下太平的日子；在這太平的日子，這條航空綫和公路，可以大大的派用塲，所以美國不惜犧牲大批的人力物力，來大動工程。</p>
<p>說起築路的方式來，其苦無比。要是不咬着牙齒幹，眞辦不了。未動工之先，要派一票雪撬和雪車隊掃除森林和冰雪。那森林倒還罷了；只有那一片堅冰，聽地質專家們說，還是幾萬年前大冰期時代的積冰。僅僅在納爾遜堡弄了幾十丈的飛機跑道，就用了一萬八千金元。可想而知，全路的代價是如何　大的一個數目。</p>
<p>到了阿拉斯加的中心費爾班克，這係路綫就分作南，北，西，三四條路綫。最重要的，還是向南經阿巧雷歧，而達柯笛阿克島的一條。因爲從這裏一直向西，就可飛到阿留西安羣島的主要地點荷蘭港；再西，就是這羣島的尾巴，一個名叫阿圖的小島。聽說這是一個秘密的所在：從這裏到堪察加，只有二百哩；而由此到扶桑，也只有一千哩不到一點的航程。</p>
<p>要是專講運輸的話，還是由費爾班克直達諾門最爲便利；因爲諾門是一個現成的港口：從這裏上船，就可直達西伯利亞。並且中途還有一個聖羅倫斯島，可以停泊打尖。可是就運輸和行軍雙方面說，當然是寧可求近而捨遠。</p>
<h3>蘇美交界</h3>
<p>圖中德小島，是阿拉斯加與西伯利亞交界之處，島名Diomedes這在蘇美兩國伯金海峽之中，關僅五十五里。</p>

<h3>解決一切問題的　工部局新機構　（二）　綜合委員會的工作　對任何人都有關係</h3>
<p>十個部門</p>
<p>歸這個委員會管轄的共有十個非常部門。每一個部分各自注意着在自己的特殊範圍內所產生出來的問題，自　解決。不過，這些部分都還沒有將他們所得的結論實施的權力。他們應以此送呈綜合委員會作縝密的考慮，以定核准與否。綜合委員會的決議才是最後決定。</p>
<p>除開各部分送呈的建議以外，綜合委員會的任何一個委員都可以提出仔何事物來討論。這最後一點無形中已將會議的範圍擴大至於無極。</p>
<p>迅速解決</p>
<p>這個方式——即一智囊團握有指揮其他各部分之全權的這一方式，大大地促進了事務的急速解決。這方式是讓一個緊急委員會控制着整個非常時期系統。每一樣事情得經過委員會的掌握。這樣，使事情簡單了許多，也减少了延擱。</p>
<p>從十二月之初起，綜合委員會毫不間斷地活動着。它曾完成了大量的工作，積下了大量的功績。它是隱在慕後策劃一切的指導之神。它曾在需要的時候創設起新的部分。去冬以來，它會立下了無量數的決定。每日上午十時，這八個人坐在一起會議，已有五個月了。每日到了同一時刻，他們也還是要照樣會議下去。直到……可是沒有人能預測這非常時期還有多長。只有一件事是敢斷言的。那便是緊急狀態若繼續存在，綜合委員會便將繼續在每天十時舉行它的會議，跟平常一樣……</p>
<p>二、物價的戰士</p>
<p>所有上海的善良居民死後往何處去？是至今還爭執着的一個題目。但至少有一件事無庸懷疑；當他們眞死了時（這個即使是上海人也畢竟元從避免的），在他們彊硬了的心上一定找得到深深地銘刻着三個字HCL。決不會是別的。因爲HCL（奇昂的生活費用）已是我們今日生存的一刻不離的（毒蠱）威脅。我們全是通貨膨脹下的亡命者；囤犬追逐中的獵物；壟斷居奇者的俎上魚。在我們灰色的生命中，只有一個希望。那偭希望就是工部局的物價統制委員會。</p>
<p>爲了我們之間境况的悲慘，便常激起了一些辛辣的譏刺。我到了一件事，我們便漫不經意地抓來隨意發洩我們的憤怒……而百分之九十九，我們的酸性幽默的靶子便是這久已含垢忍辱的工部局。「爲什麼工部局不在這上面想點辦法呢？」我們暴躁地指謫着。在我們洋洋得意的譴責聲中，從來稍費點時間思考一下眞正的事實。實際上，若曾有一次勞神査探過，我們便會出乎意料之外地發現，工部局是絕對努力在想辦法。工作之努力，遠超乎我們所能想像者之外。</p>
<p>愛因斯坦說</p>
<p>愛因斯坦有次說：「有時候一個人出錢買到了另一個人不出代價的東西。」這句短短的警語徒然反證出愛因斯坦從未有一臨上海的幸運。在今日我們這小小的世界裏，一個人甚至不再希望得到什麼，他只能夢昧着付出靡費的金錢而巳。可是千萬別誤會，把這個抱怨到工部局。假使沒有他，事情還會更糟糕。若再要問工部局在幹着什麽。那末吿訴你工部局正在幹着——跟往常一樣地幹着——用出了全付力量。</p>

<h3>帆影</h3>
<p>— 雷若華</p>
<p>睜開眼我感到了一陣微寒，轉一個身，手伏着床，我想起來添條毯子：咦，手摸到的這樣潮涇，透過無邊的黑暗，我定睛査看，什麽也看不見，只是我知道我已不是睡在床上，手上沾着潮涇的沙土，抬起頭，稀疏的星，點綴着天空，眨着眼也許是在嘲弄我做夢吧：你那裏還有床，你那裏還有屋宇，你那裏還有家，你來到了這……</p>
<p>眞的，我來到了什麼地方呢？是人間還是……？</p>
<p>我像是聽見了點什麽，是的，它就在附近，一陣奔騰澎湃的聲音，是海水嗎？我是來到了美麗的海邊嗎？啊，我眞快活得要跳起來了。可是，我到底還不敢移動，我要等着天明。</p>
<p>我是有了一種魔術嗎，你瞧，天眞的亮了。</p>
<p>然而，道不是美麗的海邊，這是一個島。沒有人家，也沒有樹木，也沒有海島。可怕的狂濤的怒號，是惟的伴侶。我想，我是落到種比魯濱遜更可悲的命運中了。</p>
<p>人間的音訊已經完全隔絕，我將怎樣來接受這寂寞的日子呢？</p>
<p>浪靜了。我站在沙灘上，我的眼睛望着遠方，我尋找一片帆影。生活在絕島上的人才眞正懂得一片帆影的珍貴呢。</p>
<p>啊呀，巨浪來了，來得這樣的突然，它把我捲進海水中。我拚命地泅游，可是離岸越來越遠了。我已精疲力盡了。我任憑海水的簸送。</p>
<p>我閉上了眼睛，可是我的眼睛睜開了。屋子黑沉沉的，外面有淅瀝的雨聲，人有點倦慵。</p>
<h3>無題（自嘲篇）</h3>
<p>— 雷開前</p>
<p>是世界交還給造物者的那一天。人類的代表垂頭喪氣地跪在他的面前，承認着自己種族的荒唐和無能。</p>
<p>造物者却仰起頭，在茫茫無際的太空中，響起輕蔑而冷酷的笑聲。</p>
<p>笑得好久，陰沉的笑聲纔宣吿停止：全宇宙也便沉默下來而那被自作聰明的人類所造成的所謂「世界文明」，也漸漸地為重新出現的原始景色所湮沒了。</p>
<p>世界便又回復到了原始的時代。</p>
<p>於是造物者叫那為人類苦役了許多年代而結果仍未能為人類所器重的耕牛到來，他叫它負起建設世界的使命。</p>
<p>一它並沒有像猪那樣的懶惰，也沒有像狐那樣的狡猾，更沒有像人那樣的驕橫貪得以及自私。」造物者降中暗暗地想：「也許它是不會將世界弄糟的。」</p>

<h3>隨意出入肉袋的小袋鼠</h3>
<p>— 拔獨</p>
<p>澳洲的袋鼠聞名全球，下面一則笑話，雖屬過火，倒也新鮮。</p>
<p>據說有一個愛爾蘭的鄕下婦人，有一次到杜白林去，採辦些鄕下買不到的東西。動身之前有人吿訴她，到達杜白林後別的地方都可以不去，動物園却不得不去觀光　番；動物園裹別的東西都可以不必參觀，而象和獅子却在必看之例，因爲牠們是難得見到的東西哩</p>
<p>她「從善如流」到動物園裏去參觀。走到一倘籠子前，看見裏吻坐着一隻長尾巴，前爪縮在胸前的怪異動物，她倒眞有些見所未見的問那管理員道：</p>
<p>「是Kangaroo（袋鼠），澳洲的土著。」他回答。</p>
<p>那婦人一聽之下，接着便道：「呀喲天哪，我的女兒就是嫁給他們之一哩。」</p>
<p>這種笑話不過形容那少見多怪，直心直肚腸的鄕下婦人而已。論那袋鼠的性格，却是非常奇特的。袋鼠一離娘胎，便自然而然的會鑽進那母袋鼠的肉袋中去。在那裏，小袋鼠口含乳頭，一動不動的蹲在裏邊。</p>
<p>兩個月之後，小袋鼠不常吃奶了。在荒野間，牠便從肉袋中跳出來，由母袋鼠喂牠吃些植物之類。</p>
<p>小袋鼠從肉袋中跳出來，非常靈便跳進去也不甚費事。不過六個月之後，因爲身軀漸大，母袋鼠漸有不勝負擔之苦。再不許那小袋鼠自由出入了。</p>
<p>小袋鼠遇到驚恐的時候，便沒命的鑽入肉袋，頭向前，長尾巴和後腿都露在外面。直到驚魂稍定，牠才托袋裹轉過身子來，把後腿和尾巴縮來裏面，而伸首袋外，去窺察外面的動靜。</p>
<p>母袋鼠從性情方面講，並不是十足的「良母」，因爲牠遇到緊急危險的時候，往往把肉袋中的「小寳貝」拖出來，然後自己逃命了。</p>
<p>Kangaroo（袋鼠）這字的原意，在澳洲人方面講是「什麼意思」之謂。最初柯克探隊到澳洲，看見這種動物，便去問那土人；土人因爲不明白他的意思，以「康茄羅」一字作答，以誤纏誤，就變爲袋鼠的名詞了。這也可說是一個笑話哩。</p>

<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（五）　拔來報往</p>
<p>維城以前不曾見過翠珍這樣的作態，便問道：「翠珍姊，什麼事？」翠珍回頭望了一望蠣窗的玻璃，瞧有人沒人在窗外，又望了維城笑道：「我想問城弟借幾個錢。我舅舅已經常常來麻煩城弟，現在父輪到我，我眞開不得口。」維城再也想不到翠珍要說這話，她說了這話，倒叉覺得什麼都放心。當時一些也不敢遲疑，怕遲疑了，就會被翠珍姊認爲是拒絕，說道；「可以可以。翠珍姊眞會說話，偏要說是借，我還和翠珍姊分家嗎？要多少，請你吿訴我？」翠珍臉上一紅道：「城弟看要多少，就是多少。」這話在維城聽來，便是奇怪，怎麼借錢倒要被借的人說數目。又答道：「我不知道翠珍姊作什麽用度，是零花，還是買果西。」翠珍道：「城弟請你借給我十塊錢吧。」維城道「可以可以。那是零花。」維城當下從身上一掏掏出一張五元票，五張一元票。他的意思，翠珍要零花，是應該挑零的給她，翠珍接下來，數了一數，也是從身上一掏，掏一張方形的黃紙來把鈔票包了，放在桌上，笑道；「城弟，你給我寫上卞翠珍三個字，這是我送大伯母買幾張鍚箔的。」</p>
<p>維城到此，才明白翠珍姊要借綫，是爲了送禮，便說道；「翠珍姊，這又何必呢？你給世德堂做的事，又負責，又耐勞，我媽早已知道了，你還送什麼禮？」維城要把包的黃紙撕掉，翠珍不肯，四隻手齊按捺在紙包上。翠珍道；「城弟，怕我不還錢嗎？我會還的，除非我姓了葉才不送禮，我現在姓卞。城弟，你不能不讓我送禮。還請你瞞着二伯母。」維城覺得翠珍的理由長，竟是沒法駁回她，便把翠珍的手拿下來，改拿了筆，在黃紙包上，寫了「楮敬卞翠珍謹具」字樣，又把帳房先生管的禮簿取出來，順着次序登帳，笑道：「翠珍姊，我得謝謝你了。」（七五）</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union Prepares to Confront a "European War" on All Fronts, Mobilizing Up to Six Million Troops; German-Russian Offensive Towards the Caucasus Possible</h3>
<p>London, 13th (Reuters) – The most important news is the German army's offensive in the eastern Crimean Kerch Peninsula. Although its nature and objective are local, its scale is larger than the winter's repeated battles. The German army is using about several divisions, covered by a large number of tanks and aircraft. Official war reports are vague. According to private messages received from London, Soviet troops are still able to hold their ground, with only a slight retreat in the north. Military observers in the Romanian capital believe that the current German offensive seems to be a prelude to the spring general offensive. In the Donets Basin north of Kerch, troop movements have been frequent recently. Comparing this to the current German offensive, it can be seen that the German High Command may launch a large-scale offensive against the Caucasus in the near future. However, London military circles say that the German spring general offensive may be launched between the 18th and 23rd of this month due to timing. The Soviet Union is said to have made preparations on all fronts to deal with this "European War." The troops used in this battle will reach six million. Germany is said to have 24 tank divisions, a total of 5,000 tanks (reportedly, half of them have been concentrated on the southern route in preparation for an attack on the Caucasus), and 2,400 aircraft. The concentrated forces are estimated to be between 400,000 and 500,000, including 15 Romanian divisions, 12 Finnish divisions, 3 Italian divisions, 2 Hungarian divisions, 1 Slovak division, 1 Spanish volunteer division, and 1 Franco-Belgian mixed volunteer division. German military supplies have been transported to the three major supply stations of Smolensk, Vitebsk, and Kyiv.</p>
<p>Moscow, 13th – The Soviet war report stated that on the 12th, our army engaged in fierce fighting on the Kerch Peninsula. There were no major changes on other fronts. 42 German aircraft were destroyed on the 11th, and we lost 15. According to confirmed information, 60 German aircraft were destroyed on May 10th.</p>
<p>Headquarters of the German Leader, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – This year's German war report states that the battle to break through the isthmus of Kerch has now been decided. The enemy has been surrounded by our army and will soon be annihilated. To date, over 40,000 enemy soldiers have been captured, and 197 armored vehicles, 598 artillery pieces, and 269 aircraft have been lost. A large amount of military supplies have also been seized. German troops are currently pursuing the remnants of the enemy forces. Yesterday, our air force sank several enemy transport ships and other vessels in the territorial waters.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – The German High Command announced that the great battle of the Kerch Isthmus has come to an end. The surrounded enemy forces have been annihilated. Over 10,000 enemy soldiers have been captured, 197 armored vehicles have been lost, 598 artillery pieces have been lost, and 260 aircraft have been destroyed. The loss of military equipment and supplies is incalculable. The fleeing enemy is being pursued. In short, the German plan to break through the Kerch Isthmus has been successfully completed.</p>
<h3>Major Battle Underway on the Kerch Peninsula; Heavy Losses on Both Sides</h3>
<p>London, 13th (Reuters) – Hitler's headquarters announced today that German forces have annihilated the Soviet garrison on the Kerch Peninsula. Other reports indicate that the advancing Axis forces are engaged in a major battle with Soviet troops under General Kozlov. The Soviet forces that recovered the peninsula last December were under Kozlov. The New York Times' dispatch from Moscow today stated that strong German forces, assisted by tanks and aircraft, appear to have launched four or five attacks from Taganrog westwards, northward to Kitayleno and Petropavlovka, turning west to the line of Dnepropetrovsk. However, progress has only been made near Petropavlovka, where Soviet troops have retreated three miles. Losses on both sides are heavy. Today's Soviet midday communiqué still stated that "nothing of importance occurred on the front line last night." Its supplementary communiqué stated that there was slight activity on the southern and northwestern fronts, but did not mention the Crimean battle. According to Moscow Radio, heavy fighting took place on the Kerch Peninsula throughout yesterday and is still ongoing. It is generally believed that both sides have sent large forces to fight, with the Germans concentrating large groups of cavalry, tanks, and infantry, including Romanian and Italian troops. Moscow has expressed confidence that the Red Army will defeat the German attempt to approach the Caucasus.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Havas) – Military sources here say that the Kerch area battle should not be considered the beginning of the German spring offensive. The scope of the battle is limited, and the objectives have been determined early on. In other words, the Germans intend to gain an advantage there in order to launch a larger offensive. However, the battle is still extremely important, because once the Germans are victorious, the Red Army will lose a strategically important "springboard area" and will be unable to use it to counterattack and recover Crimea. As a result, the Red Army's fortifications in the area and the area's natural barriers will all fall into German hands. The term "springboard" is not new. It refers to any narrow position with dense air defense equipment and the ability to quickly concentrate other troops in areas near the enemy. Although the Red Army has a large number of troops, Germany and its allies pride themselves on their well-trained and well-equipped troops. The Germans will also fully utilize new weapons. In short, the current war effort has been prepared for a long time and is therefore not comparable to ordinary conflicts.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Havas) – The "German General Report" published an article today commenting on the Eastern Front, stating, "We expect the Red Army defending the Kerch front to resist stubbornly, because the enemy has made full use of the winter to consolidate its positions, has already concentrated reserve forces, resulting in a large number of troops, and the Red Army there is assisted by the Soviet Black Sea Fleet, with transportation routes as smooth as ever. Under these circumstances, we must prepare for a determined battle."</p>
<h3>Rumors of German Vanguard Reaching the Shores of the Sea of Azov; New Weapons Used in the Attack on Kerch</h3>
<p>Bucharest, Romania, 13th (Havas) – After three days of artillery and air battles, the German forces on the Kerch Peninsula front launched a large-scale offensive on the night of the 10th. That evening, German and Romanian combined engineering and infantry units, riding on steel-plated boats towed by fast steamships, landed behind Soviet lines. Although the Soviet army resisted desperately, it had no choice but to retreat due to the lack of artillery. That night, the German army built a bridgehead in the narrow area between the Black Sea and Lake Uzunlar. The next night, the German army continued to land on both sides of the bridgehead, and the Soviet army urgently transferred large reinforcements, and fierce battles resumed. By the morning of the 12th, the German army had reached the outskirts of Maryenka. At the same time, the German offensive towards the Arabat Spit also broke through the Soviet lines. In addition, with the help of dive bombers, the German and Romanian allied forces attacked the Soviet army in Zoya. The Soviet line was also breached within a few hours. On the night of the 12th, the German army launched a full-scale offensive, making contact with the German landing forces south of Lake Uzunlar. That night, the German vanguard reached the city of Maryenka and continued to advance north. At dawn today, they had reached the shores of the Sea of Azov, only a few miles from the port of Mayak. The Soviet forces in front were surrounded between Balbachik and the Arabat Spit, cutting off their retreat. The surrounded Soviet forces numbered only three divisions, equipped with excellent tanks.</p>
<p>Bucharest, Romania, 12th (Havas) – Official announcement: The advance troops of the German-Romanian allied forces have surrounded three divisions of the Red Army on the Kerch Peninsula and are now operating according to plan.</p>
<p>Bucharest, Romania, 12th (Havas) – Military sources said that the German army used some new weapons in the sudden attack on the Kerch area, which greatly surprised the Red Army soldiers. The Germans are satisfied with the results of using the new weapons, which have proven to be very effective in destroying the enemy's solid fortifications and can destroy the positions that prevent the advance of tanks. The purpose of this offensive is to occupy important strongholds in order to advance directly towards the Caucasus.</p>
<p>Bucharest, Romania, 12th (Havas) – Well-informed sources said that a major battle has now broken out on the Kerch Peninsula, but the scope of the battle is still unknown. However, this war can be regarded as the prelude to the German offensive against the Caucasus. Previously, the German army planned to advance towards the Volga River, attempting to isolate the Red Army defending the Caucasus and cut off contact with the Rostov-Astrakhan line. But at this point, the plan has been changed, and a "pincer strategy" is to be adopted, attacking the Caucasus from Crimea and Rostov. However, fighting on the Kerch Peninsula is very difficult and will take at least ten days to end. Therefore, this action will not materialize for a while. In addition, the Soviet Union has concentrated seven Red Army divisions in the Kerch area, all with the assistance of tanks, and its strength is sufficient and cannot be underestimated. Although the German air force has an advantage, the Red Army has good anti-aircraft artillery and a large number of fighter planes. The strength of both sides is evenly matched, so it is particularly difficult to determine the winner.</p>
<h3>Soviet Attack Southeast of Lake Ilmen</h3>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Havas) – Official announcement: Yesterday, under the cover of aircraft and artillery, the Red Army launched a fierce attack on our positions southeast of Lake Ilmen. The battle lasted all day, and the Red Army was finally repelled. Our air force assisted the army in combat and was very successful, destroying many Soviet tanks and bombing enemy supply lines and troop concentration points behind the Red Army lines, destroying 50 trucks and damaging roads, making them impassable for vehicles.</p>
<h3>The US Government is Studying the Military Developments in the Soviet Territory</h3>
<p>Washington, 11th (Havas) – According to a Berlin dispatch, Romanian troops are now assisting the German army in attacking the Soviet Union in the Crimean Peninsula. When Secretary of State Hull received reporters today, a reporter asked about this. Hull replied that the US government is currently studying the military developments in the Soviet Union and is closely watching the situation in the Balkans. At this point, Hull reiterated the statement previously made by Under Secretary of State Welles, stating that if Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria continue to assist Germany, the United States will not hesitate to declare war on those countries.</p>
<h3>International Briefs</h3>
<p>Washington, 12th (Havas) – The War Production Board announced that the republics of South America will have priority in obtaining important raw materials from the United States. About 100 types of these raw materials will soon be shipped out.</p>
<p>Montevideo, Uruguay, 12th (Havas) – The government is currently reorganizing the arms industry in order to participate in the defense of the Americas in the future.</p>
<p>Sofia, Bulgaria, 12th (Havas) – The military court in Skopje today tried sixteen armed communists, resulting in eighteen people being sentenced to death and the remaining eighteen being sentenced to prison terms ranging from eight to fifteen years.</p>

<h3>French and American Representatives Continue Negotiations; Pétain Hastens Back to Vichy; Rumored Decision on the Matter</h3>
<p>Washington, 13th (Havas) – The negotiations between France and the United States on the issue of Martinique in the West Indies are still continuing in a good atmosphere. According to American sources, significant progress has been made after recent meetings between Admiral Robert, the French High Commissioner for the West Indies, and General Hoover, the American representative. At the same time, Marshal Pétain's hasty return to Vichy from the countryside is also being taken seriously here, as the French leader's actions can be seen as a sign that the French government leaders are about to make a decision on these negotiations. However, the US believes that since the French headquarters are far away from this territory and transportation is difficult, it would be more convenient for the local authorities to directly exchange opinions with the United States. The United States has always considered this view as policy, and it has recently been explained by Secretary of State Hull. In essence, the relationship between the United States and the various French territories will be based on the principle of local negotiations. The reason is that the US government aims to facilitate bilateral negotiations and has no intention of denying French sovereignty over Martinique.</p>
<p>Washington, 12th (Havas) – Secretary of State Hull refused to make any statement on the issue of Martinique when he received reporters today, only saying, "The negotiations between General Hoover and Admiral Robert, the governor of French Martinique, are still ongoing. I have nothing to announce at this time."</p>
<h3>French Air Force Suffers Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>Vichy, 13th (Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>The French Ministry of Aviation revealed that the French Air Force suffered heavy losses while defending Diego Suarez (an important naval base) in Madagascar. French aircraft were completely destroyed, and the names of the fifteen French pilots who died for the country were all disclosed.</p>
<p>Vichy, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – The secretary of the new French government leader, former French Minister of Colonies Platon, issued a statement to the French in Madagascar, stating that the British military operation in Madagascar does not claim to protect the interests of the French people, nor does it use traitors to achieve its aim of seizing French territories, but uses genuine British troops to occupy Madagascar. The excuses made by the British in the past actions against Dakar, Saint Pierre, and Miquelon are a thing of the past. This time, the British have revealed their true colors. Fellow Frenchmen residing in Madagascar, you can now understand the British strategy. Historical evidence proves that the British only take risks where there is no danger. France is deeply impressed by the heroic operations of its colonial land, sea, and air forces. Our compatriots fighting in Madagascar have not only demonstrated France's determination to defend its territories with blood but also to maintain the sovereignty of the great French colonial empire.</p>
<h3>Australian Communiqué States Communications with the Philippines Severed</h3>
<p>Allied Headquarters, Australia, 13th (Reuters) – Today's communiqué did not mention any combat activity in General MacArthur's various war zones, which is the first time in many weeks. According to official sources, there is no news coming from the Philippines because telecommunications have been severed.</p>

<h3>US Senate Passes Bill to Establish Women's Auxiliary Corps Attached to the Army; Auxiliary Corps for the Air Force Already Passed by the House</h3>
<p>Washington, 12th (Havas) – The Senate today passed the bill to establish a "Women's Auxiliary Corps" attached to the US Army by a vote of 38 to 27. The bill states that the Women's Auxiliary Corps is not part of the regular army and that women aged 20 and over may join the service, but the number is limited to 150,000, to perform various tasks to free up men for combat units. In addition, the Air Force also plans to add a Women's Auxiliary Corps. This bill has been supported by the War Department and passed by the House of Representatives. The Senate also studied it today. However, the amendment proposed by Senator Maloney, which stipulated that the Women's Auxiliary Corps could only serve within the United States, was rejected by the Senate.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – According to news here last night, the American people are closely watching the outcome of yesterday's Senate meeting, which decided whether to establish a women's auxiliary corps in the Air Force. The House of Representatives has already passed a resolution to establish a women's auxiliary corps, so the bill has been submitted to the Senate for approval. The members of the Women's Auxiliary Corps are engaged in driving cars and trucks, operating telegraphs and telephones, and medical affairs. The United States is also following the example of Germany by establishing agricultural courses in schools to enable students to automatically go to the countryside to work during the holidays. Male students work in the fields, and female students help farm women manage housework. In Chicago, 60 male and female students have volunteered for this work, and in New York, 13,000 middle school students are willing to participate. The number of female workers in American armament factories is increasing daily. The Midwest of the United States announced yesterday that it would replace half of the workers in ammunition factories with female workers.</p>

<h3>Alaska Highway (5)</h3>
<p>Since March of last year, the housewives have also done a very significant job for the country, which is to donate all the aluminum utensils they no longer need at home to the country. This is the most needed raw material for manufacturing Flying Fortresses and the like, and it is a good deed that is beneficial without being costly for the housewives. Last year's magazines and newspapers often published photos and statistical reports of the results of this type of campaign. The statistics for this now are probably hard to describe with numbers.</p>
<p>As for how farmers, workers, students, etc. are mobilized, there are many records, so we don't need to nag about it. Even the unemployed people are now almost all placed in batches by the unemployment organizations. These are all complicated and trivial tasks, and they also require considerable time to arrange.</p>
<p>However, new situations have been emerging constantly in recent months, and the difficulty of transportation has been increasing as a result. For example, American ships used to be able to go directly to Vladivostok, but now they can't, so they have to detour through India and transfer through the Near East to their destination. Recently, even India is not very convenient, so what should we do?</p>
<p>Several months ago, the Americans had already seen this point, so there was a plan to build the Alaska Highway. But there is always one point that we must understand, that is, the focus of this so-called World War is not in the Pacific, but in the Atlantic and Europe. Regardless of whether the reader agrees with this proposition or not, the British and American military and political circles are indeed arranging and implementing it in this way. Therefore, the construction of the Alaska Highway is more like opening up a new path for transportation to the Soviet Union than a strategic relationship. However, the most subtle point is that the Americans' focus is on the Aleutian Islands directly reaching Kamchatka, and not on the Bering Strait. This is a point worth pondering.</p>
<p>In order to explain the Alaska Highway, we mentioned why the Americans only thought of building the highway at this time; in order to explain this problem, we have involved everything else about the United States. This seems to have dragged the reader around in a big circle for no reason; we are very sorry. Now let's talk a little about the origins of this highway.</p>
<p>This highway is more of a historical material of modern times than a matter of the current situation. Originally, in February 1941, after a meeting between the British and American authorities, it was decided to extend the Canadian air route. How long to extend it? To the west coast of Alaska, and if possible, directly to the Soviet Union along Siberia.</p>
<p>The starting points of this air route are London in England and Washington in the United States. The intersection of these two points is on the island of Newfoundland mentioned in the previous article. From Newfoundland to Quebec, according to aviation, it is only a glance away, only ten minutes of flight. From Quebec to Winnipeg and then to Edmonton, that is a long distance; then from Edmonton to Fort Nelson, and then to Watson Lake. If you go further west, that is Fairbanks, the center of Alaska.</p>
<p>However, with the airline, you have to build a highway along the line. From Quebec to Edmonton, there is already a transcontinental railway, so there is no need to bother at all. From Edmonton to Fort Nelson, there are also possible transportation highways, waterways, etc. But from here to the west and north, to put it in literary terms, it is "ice and snow cover the ground, boundless at a glance."</p>
<p>Since the air route proposal was decided, the US Department of Transportation entrusted this project to the Western Construction Company of Edmonton and the General Construction Company of Vancouver; one built the Fort Nelson airfield, and the other built the Watson Lake airfield. The two companies cooperated on the highway. The hard thing is that these two sections are 300 miles away from the nearest railway station. Fortunately, once the war is over, it will be a time of peace in the world; in these peaceful days, this air route and highway can be of great use, so the United States does not hesitate to sacrifice a large amount of manpower and material resources to carry out the project.</p>
<p>Speaking of the way of road construction, it is extremely difficult. If you don't grit your teeth and do it, you really can't do it. Before construction starts, a team of sleds and snowmobiles must be sent to clear the forest and ice and snow. The forest is fine; only the solid ice, according to geologists, is accumulated ice from the Great Ice Age tens of thousands of years ago. Just building dozens of feet of runway at Fort Nelson cost 18,000 gold dollars. It is conceivable how large a number the cost of the entire road is.</p>
<p>When you get to Fairbanks, the center of Alaska, this line is divided into south, north, and west routes. The most important thing is the one that goes south through Anchorage to Kodiak Island. Because from here directly west, you can fly to Dutch Harbor, the main point of the Aleutian Islands; further west is the tail of these islands, a small island called Attu. It is said that this is a secret place: from here to Kamchatka, it is only 200 miles; and from here to Fusang (Japan), it is only a little less than 1,000 miles.</p>
<p>If you are only talking about transportation, it is most convenient to go directly from Fairbanks to Nome; because Nome is an existing port: from here you can board a ship and go directly to Siberia. And there is also St. Lawrence Island in the middle, where you can dock for a short break. But in terms of both transportation and marching, it is of course better to seek the near and abandon the far.</p>
<h3>Border between Soviet Union and America</h3>
<p>The small island in the picture is the border between Alaska and Siberia. The island is named Diomedes, which is in the middle of the Bering Strait between the Soviet Union and the United States, only 55 miles away.</p>

<h3>Rice Shops Exchange Flat Rice with Small Bills; Hoarding of Small Bills is Inappropriate; Banking Sector Seeks to Eliminate Panic of Small Bills</h3>
<p>According to the English-language Da Mei Evening News, according to news this morning (13th), the responsible authority in the banking sector is currently formulating effective measures to ease the acute monetary situation caused by the shortage of small bills and to eliminate the troubles encountered by the public when purchasing retail items. It is heard that there are two measures to be taken: one is to add one-dollar banknotes, and the other is for the government to come forward to prohibit individuals and stores from hoarding small bills. Qualified people believe that the current shortage of small bills is because most rice shops in the city exchange flat rice and refuse to use the small bills they receive. There are thousands of rice shops squeezing to purchase flat rice, all of which require small bills. This is the biggest factor affecting the current monetary situation. It is expected that the government will take action on this, and the situation should ease at that time. The current situation can be compared to the use of stamps to replace small change a few years ago. Later, when the authorities decided to add small change notes, the situation quickly improved.</p>
<h3>Restaurant Owner's Child Kidnapped; Negotiation at Designated Place, Police and Bandits Fight; One Criminal Captured, Others Escaped</h3>
<p>A Western restaurant on Bei'du'ao Road, Xiafei Road, French Concession, is opened by a Shandong man named Song. Song has a son, seven years old. He disappeared suddenly a week ago while playing with a group of children in front of the restaurant. Song asked everywhere, but there was no news. Unexpectedly, after the child disappeared, Song received two threatening letters, demanding a ransom of 50,000 French francs and asking him to send someone to negotiate near the barbed wire on Columbia Road, Shanghai West, at 2 pm on the 13th. Song immediately reported to the police station. At 1 pm yesterday, he sent detectives disguised to wait there. As expected, three kidnappers came. When the detectives were about to step forward to negotiate, they were discovered by the bandits as disguised detectives. They turned around and tried to escape. The detectives immediately drew their guns and fired at the three kidnappers. The bandits also drew their guns and returned fire. The two sides exchanged more than twenty shots. As a result, one bandit was arrested and a pistol was found. The other two bandits escaped without a trace. At that time, there were few pedestrians on the road, so fortunately no one was injured. It is still unknown where the hostage is hidden. The police station is investigating and rescuing him.</p>
<h3>A Certain Society Generously Distributes Sawing Funds; Benefits the Poor Scholars</h3>
<p>Our newspaper received a letter yesterday from a certain society, stating that it generously transferred part of the income from its base surplus item and proposed 8,000 yuan to be allocated to our newspaper's reader scholarship fund. The benevolent actions are admirable. The society also gave detailed insights, instructing that this scholarship donation should be given priority to the children of teachers and news practitioners who are unable to afford to study. This shows the society's sincere sympathy for cultural workers. In the past, the newspaper's scholarship fund committee has been sponsored and supervised by all sectors of society for scholarship applications from all walks of life, striving to be fair and impartial. In the future, it will follow the established rules to make scholarship work more widespread. Since the society has given special reminders, the donation will be used to give priority to the poor children of teachers and news practitioners in accordance with the regulations, in order to live up to the society's kindness. Yesterday, the scholarship fund received 8,000 yuan from a certain society, 5 yuan from an anonymous person (receipt number 288), and 1 yuan from He Shou, totaling 8,006 yuan. The previous savings were 47,094 yuan and 53 cents, totaling 55,100 yuan and 53 cents.</p>

<h3>Organizing a Water Security System; Plan to Register Ships First</h3>
<p>According to the English-language Times, the leader of the Public Concession Security System claimed that the security system has made great progress since it was launched in mid-February. Regarding the Shanghai River Ship Industry Association and the major Japanese shipping companies' request to organize a water security system, it is heard that the responsible authorities are investigating the current situation on the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek in order to formulate a suitable water security system plan. However, everything on the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek must be registered first. Only then can concrete steps be implemented.</p>

The citizen's cards in the French Concession and the Chinese areas will also be issued successively, but the period will be later, so the issuance of citizen's cards for all citizens in Shanghai will be completed in August.</p>
<h3>Huangpu Bund, Renji Road; Permanently Closed Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Puppet Show; First Performance Last Night</h3>
<p>Datong News Agency reported, according to the English-language Da Mei Evening News, Shanghai's first-ever puppet company has been organized and its first performance was held last night at the Jewish General Association on Jing'an Temple Road. The performance was directed by Mr. Gottlin, a Westerner, and the Shanghai Puppet Theater Troupe was responsible for the performance. Mr. Gottlin was a film director in Berlin. He and the technical director, Irving Gottlin, spent several months researching and preparing for this puppet show. They made 15 puppets and a small stage by themselves. During the performance, some experts among the European Jewish refugees were responsible for pulling the strings and dialogue. There was a loudspeaker in the hall to transmit the voices, so that all the audience could hear them. The puppets they made were very delicate and flexible. Not only could they dance to the beat of the music, but their eyes could also open and close as needed, and their lips could also move like life when they spoke. Each puppet was about two feet high and could move freely on a two-yard-long stage. The plays performed by the company not only adopted European scripts, but also original new plays. The dialogues were either in English or German, or in Chinese or Japanese. The puppet troupe did not have a fixed theater and could be hired to perform at any time.</p>
<h3>Japanese Embassy Spokesman Talks About; Optimistic About the Future of People's Food; Japanese Authorities are Working Hard to Remedy the Situation</h3>
<p>According to the English-language Da Mei Evening News, Kawasaki Torao, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy, said at a press conference yesterday (12th) that the most serious problem Shanghai is currently facing is the issue of people's food supply. However, the Japanese authorities are now working hard to remedy this situation. Some people are optimistic about people's food, and some are pessimistic, depending on whether they have enough food themselves. It is undeniable that there are many people in this city who are taking advantage of the opportunity to make profits and engage in other illegal activities. However, the Japanese authorities are trying their best to solve this situation, so there is good reason to be optimistic about the future of this city.</p>
<h3>Italian Ship Conte Verde; Preparing to Evacuate Overseas Chinese; Date of Evacuation of British and American Overseas Chinese Undecided; More Than 400 Crew Members Will Accompany the Ship</h3>

<h3>More Than 500,000 Foreign Exchange Stolen in the Past Two Weeks; Mostly Servants Stealing Valuable Items</h3>
<p>According to the English-language Shanghai Times, in the past two weeks, valuable items such as cash, jewelry, and ornaments of foreigners in this city have been stolen by their servants, with a value of about more than 500,000 yuan. According to authoritative sources, most police stations in the two concessions have received reports from these foreigners, saying that the Amahs or cooks they hired stole certain valuable items and escaped without a trace. Currently, police stations have sent out a large number of detectives to search for the fleeing thieves. It is heard that in the cases reported by the police stations, 90% of the plaintiffs cannot report the address of the fleeing servants, and some even do not know the surnames of the servants. Therefore, it is not easy to detect these fugitives. Among the cases of this kind in the police stations, the amount stolen in a certain case reached 30,000 yuan, and in another case, jewelry worth 15,000 yuan was stolen. The occurrence of such cases mostly occurs when the foreign masters are out, especially on weekends. And after the theft, it took several weeks to be discovered, so the criminals were able to escape and hide in the four suburbs at ease, which made the detective work difficult.</p>
<h3>Two Fires in Shanghai West</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, at 4:04, a fire broke out suddenly at , Yuyuan Road, Shanghai West. For a time, the flames soared and could not be contained.

Also, yesterday afternoon at 6:15, a fire broke out suddenly on the drying platform of Yongdachang Southern Goods Store at the triangle of Jisi Fei'er Road, Shanghai West. The fire brigade tried its best to extinguish the fire after a long time. When the fire was raging, a male household member was eager to escape and fled from the fire pit to the window of the building, causing him to be severely burned. Fortunately, he was still able to jump out of the window and escape. Afterwards, he was rushed to the hospital for emergency treatment.</p>

<h3>The New Municipal Council Organization to Solve All Problems (II) The Work of the General Purposes Committee Relates to Everyone</h3>
<p>Ten Departments</p>
<p>There are a total of ten extraordinary departments under the jurisdiction of this committee. Each department focuses on and resolves problems arising within its own specific scope. However, these departments do not have the authority to implement their conclusions. They must submit them to the General Purposes Committee for thorough consideration to determine whether or not to approve them. The decisions of the General Purposes Committee are final.</p>
<p>In addition to the proposals submitted by the various departments, any member of the General Purposes Committee may propose any matter for discussion. This last point implicitly expands the scope of the meeting to an unlimited extent.</p>
<p>Rapid Resolution</p>
<p>This approach—that is, the method of a think tank holding full authority over other departments—greatly promotes the rapid resolution of matters. This approach allows an emergency committee to control the entire emergency system. Every matter must be under the committee's control. This simplifies things considerably and reduces delays.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of December, the General Purposes Committee has been active non-stop. It has completed a large amount of work and accumulated a great deal of merit. It is the guiding spirit behind the scenes, planning everything. It has created new departments when needed. Since last winter, it has made countless decisions. Every day at ten o'clock in the morning, these eight people sit together for meetings, and it has been five months. Every day at the same time, they will continue to meet as usual. Until... but no one can predict how long this emergency will last. Only one thing can be said with certainty: if the state of emergency continues to exist, the General Purposes Committee will continue to hold its meetings at ten o'clock every day, as usual...</p>
<p>II. The Warriors of Commodity Prices</p>
<p>Where do all the good residents of Shanghai go after they die? This is a topic that is still being debated. But at least one thing is beyond doubt: when they really die (which even Shanghai residents ultimately cannot avoid), three words, HCL, will definitely be found deeply engraved on their hardened hearts. It will never be anything else. Because HCL (the High Cost of Living) is the inescapable threat that accompanies every moment of our survival today. We are all fugitives under inflation; prey chased by hoarders; fish on the chopping block of monopolists. In our gray lives, there is only one hope. That hope is the Municipal Council's Commodity Price Control Committee.</p>
<p>The wretchedness of our situation often provokes some bitter sarcasm. When something happens, we casually grab it and vent our anger... and ninety-nine percent of the time, the target of our acidic humor is the long-suffering Municipal Council. "Why doesn't the Municipal Council do something about this?" we angrily point out. In our triumphant condemnation, we never take a moment to consider the real facts. In reality, if we had ever bothered to investigate, we would have been surprised to find that the Municipal Council is absolutely working hard to find a solution. The effort is far beyond what we can imagine.</p>
<p>Einstein Said</p>
<p>Einstein once said, "Sometimes a person pays to buy something that another person gets for nothing." This short warning only proves that Einstein never had the good fortune to visit Shanghai. In our little world today, a person no longer even hopes to get anything; he can only dream of paying extravagant amounts of money. But make no mistake, don't complain about this to the Municipal Council. If it weren't for them, things would be even worse. If you still want to ask what the Municipal Council is doing, then let me tell you, the Municipal Council is doing—as always—using all its strength.</p>

<h3>Paper Money Weak</h3>
<p>In addition to the short-term change in single banknotes hoarding, the foreign currency market situation is as stable as ever. The former is still 500 yuan for British gold pounds, and the latter is still 510 yuan. US dollar notes are around 33 yuan. Hong Kong notes are still 5 yuan and 5 yuan 10 cents. Military notes opened at 7 yuan 38 cents in the morning, rose to 44 cents after opening, but then immediately fell, and finally closed at 7 yuan 26 cents, down 12 cents from the previous day.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bankers' Association's interbank lending rate rose another 2 cents to 14 cents. The discount rate for cashier's checks is still 20 yuan and 25 yuan per thousand yuan. The premium for reserve notes is about 30 cents per yuan.</p>
<p>Single banknotes are still scarce, but changes may occur soon. The reason is that stores lack single banknotes for change and are forced to (A) secretly increase prices, (B) reduce the limit for single banknote exchange to the minimum. In this way, the demand for single banknotes is reduced in a subtle way. Furthermore, the scarcer the goods, the more they are collected, and when they collapse one day, they will feel abundant again. Picking new and rejecting old is like buying banknotes now. Thirdly, the stores that absorb the most single banknotes today are rice stores. Rice stores do not sell without single banknotes, but this cannot be generalized. Many rice stores will give change if they can, and if they cannot, they will also have ways to make do. However, most of them are as black-hearted as coal and will not sell without single banknotes. With single banknotes, you can buy two sheng, which is nothing more than exploitation. Now citizens need single banknotes, one is for buying rice, and the other is for buying vegetables. If there is a solution for rice, then the way to collect single banknotes will be cut off. Nothing can win the hearts of the people more than changing the rice sale to 2.5 sheng for 6 yuan as a unit to reduce the use of single banknotes by two-thirds and allow the public to buy more rice. However, it is necessary to crack down on the "rice squeezing party", otherwise good people will not get rice, but bad people will get more rice and form gangs to squeeze, which is not a fair distribution method. Fourthly, many stores are using methods to make up for the shortage of single banknotes, such as substitute coupons, which will inevitably emerge one after another. This is also enough to curb the hoarding of single banknotes. Yesterday, single banknotes were bought in for 100 yuan for 78 yuan, and sold out for 112 yuan. Ruthless people are not included in this case.</p>
<h3>Spot Cash is Sold Everywhere</h3>
<p>The spot cash market is hot and red, and the price has changed from rising to falling. The selling intention of cash houses and securities houses is still good. Although the trading volume is strong, the price fluctuations are still small. The opening price in the early morning was still 21,400 yuan, the same as the noon price of the previous day. Seeing securities houses buying in, the price immediately rose, and someone bought in 10 taels, rising to 21,650 yuan. Cash houses rushed to sell everywhere, and securities houses suddenly came and sold again. The price gradually lowered, and the silver houses also sold out. The lowest price was 21,300 yuan. Someone bought in. The final trading price at noon was 21,350 yuan, 50 yuan less than the previous day, with a difference of 350 yuan. The final price was 21,300 yuan, with only selling households and no buying households.</p>
<p>The price of gold ornaments in silver shops is still 2,250 yuan per tael (200 yuan less for buying in) in all major new stores. The price of silver ingots is 18 yuan, and the black market price is 15.89 yuan, which has rebounded. The price of a silver coin is still 9.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Buyers Are Buying Government Bonds, The More the Better, There Must Be Other Special Ways to Go</h3>
<p>In the gray market for government bonds, the market fluctuated even more yesterday. The sellers were still very enthusiastic, but the absorption capacity of the buyers was also very strong. Spot goods, "hundreds of thousands sold out, unexpectedly failed to push the market price down, but instead tended to rise. This kind of strength competition is really admirable. The macro food intake of the multiple parties and the speed of consumption, the gray market, has never had such a huge situation before. For example, yesterday the large households sold out, and two families had a spectrum of 1.5 million, and other families followed suit, also having 450,000. They were all absorbed by multiple parties, and several companies only received and did not sell. Its strength can be imagined. Since the previous selling, it is estimated that there have been more than 30 million, with a total of 1 million taels of silver. No matter the strength in the same industry, it is not enough to talk about this. Even the smaller financial sector cannot be undertaken by one or two companies. It is expected that in addition to a part being absorbed by strength, most of them have other special ways to go, which cannot be viewed from the bottom of the well. Yesterday, Tongli continued to sell, and the number was no less than the previous day. Wuhua, Xie Kang, and Hongxing also sold more than 300,000, and Tongkang, Yuanhe, Tongshun, and Hongda also sold quite a bit. The market price was slightly lower for a while, and then immediately rose. Shunli bought more than 300,000, and Hu Heji, Xinji, Chengkang, Xinhua, Zhongfu, Jiufeng, Yongchang, Kai, Hengyu, Lianhe, Lianyi, Gongmao, Tongyuan, etc. were all buying in one after another. Retail investors' buying and selling were not counted. 1.5 million spot goods flowed out. As a result, except for type C which was slightly lower by 20 cents, the rest rose by 40 cents to 70 cents. The transaction volume was about 2 million yuan. The following is a brief table.</p>

<h3>Sail Shadow</h3>
<p>— Lei Ruohua</p>
<p>Opening my eyes, I felt a chill. Turning over, my hand resting on the bed, I thought to add a blanket: Huh, my hand touched something so damp. Through the boundless darkness, I stared to see what it was, but I couldn't see anything. I just knew I wasn't sleeping on the bed anymore. My hand was covered in damp sand. I looked up, sparse stars adorning the sky, blinking, perhaps mocking me for dreaming: You still have a bed there, you still have a house there, you still have a home there, but you've come to this...</p>
<p>Really, where have I come to? Is it the human world or...?</p>
<p>I thought I heard something. Yes, it was nearby, a surging, roaring sound. Was it the sea? Have I come to a beautiful seaside? Ah, I'm so happy I could jump up. But I still didn't dare to move. I would wait for the dawn.</p>
<p>Have I acquired some kind of magic? Look, it's really bright.</p>
<p>However, it wasn't a beautiful seaside. It was an island. No houses, no trees, no seabirds. The terrifying roar of the raging waves was my only companion. I thought I had fallen into a fate more pathetic than Robinson Crusoe.</p>
<p>The sounds of the human world were completely cut off. How would I accept these lonely days?</p>
<p>The waves calmed. I stood on the beach, my eyes gazing into the distance, searching for a sail shadow. Only those who live on isolated islands truly understand the preciousness of a sail shadow.</p>
<p>Oh no, a giant wave was coming, coming so suddenly. It swept me into the sea. I swam desperately, but I was getting farther and farther from the shore. I was exhausted. I let the sea toss me about.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes, but my eyes opened again. The room was dark and silent, and there was the sound of drizzling rain outside. I felt a little tired and listless.</p>
<h3>Untitled (Self-Mockery)</h3>
<p>— Lei Kaqian</p>
<p>It was the day the world was returned to its creator. The representative of humanity knelt dejectedly before him, admitting the absurdity and incompetence of his race.</p>
<p>The Creator, however, raised his head, and a contemptuous and cold laugh echoed in the vast expanse of space.</p>
<p>Laughing for a long time, the somber laughter announced its cessation: the entire universe then fell silent, and the so-called "world civilization" created by the presumptuous human race was gradually submerged by the reappearing primitive landscape.</p>
<p>The world then returned to the primitive era.</p>
<p>So the Creator called the ox, who had toiled for humanity for many years but had still failed to be valued by humanity, to come and take on the mission of building the world.</p>
<p>"It is not as lazy as a pig, nor as cunning as a fox, and even less arrogant, greedy, and selfish as a human." The Creator thought secretly in his heart, "Perhaps it will not mess up the world."</p>
<p>From then on, the ox was made the "spirit of all things." And what about humans? That was up to the ox's pleasure, to decide what "categories," "classes," "species," and "races" they belonged to.</p>
<p>Animals</p>
<h3>The Joey That Freely Enters and Exits the Pouch</h3>
<p>— Ba Du</p>
<p>Australia's kangaroos are world-renowned. The following joke, though a bit over the top, is nonetheless refreshing.</p>
<p>It is said that an Irish countrywoman once went to Dublin to buy some things that she couldn't find in the countryside. Before she set off, someone told her that after arriving in Dublin, she didn't have to go anywhere else, but she had to visit the zoo. And in the zoo, she didn't have to see anything else, but the elephant and the lion were a must-see, because they were rare things to see.</p>
<p>She "followed good advice" and went to the zoo for a visit. She walked in front of a cage and saw a strange animal with a long tail and its front paws tucked in front of its chest. She was indeed seeing something she had never seen before and asked the warden:</p>
<p>"Is that a Kangaroo, an indigenous Australian?" he replied.</p>
<p>As soon as the woman heard this, she continued, "Oh my goodness, my daughter is married to one of them!"</p>
<p>This kind of joke only describes the countrywoman who is ignorant and straightforward. As for the kangaroo's personality, it is very unique. As soon as the kangaroo leaves the womb, it naturally crawls into the mother kangaroo's pouch. There, the joey, with its mouth on the nipple, squats motionless inside.</p>
<p>Two months later, the joey no longer nurses often. In the wilderness, it jumps out of the pouch and the mother kangaroo feeds it plants and the like.</p>
<p>The joey jumps out of the pouch very easily, and it is not difficult to jump back in. However, after six months, because its body gradually grows larger, the mother kangaroo gradually finds it unbearable to bear the burden. She no longer allows the joey to enter and exit freely.</p>
<p>When the joey is startled, it desperately dives into the pouch, head first, with its long tail and hind legs exposed outside. Only when the shock has subsided does it turn around in the pouch, retract its hind legs and tail inside, and stretch its head out of the pouch to observe the outside world.</p>
<p>From a character standpoint, the mother kangaroo is not a completely "good mother," because when she encounters an emergency, she often drags the "little treasure" out of the pouch and then runs away.</p>
<p>The original meaning of the word Kangaroo, in Australian terms, means "what does that mean". When the Cook expedition first arrived in Australia, they saw this animal and went to ask the natives. Because the natives did not understand what they meant, they answered with the word "kangaroo". Due to a misunderstanding, it became the name of the kangaroo. This can also be said to be a joke.</p>
<h3>Elevated Machine Gun</h3>
<p>— Yongyun</p>
<p>In order to counter fighter planes strafing soldiers in the trenches, someone invented an elevated machine gun. The machine gun is supported by a tripod, just like a camera. The range of the elevated machine gun is also farther than that of ordinary machine guns, and it can arbitrarily sweep the sky in all directions.</p>
<h3>Proverbs of the Malagasy People</h3>
<p>— Zhengzheng</p>
<p>The Malagasy people are a nation that likes to use proverbs. Some proverbs have been passed down from primitive societies, and some are similar to those of Europeans and Asians, but most of them contain profound meanings. The following are a few selected:</p>
<p>Marriage is not a dead knot, but a living knot.</p>
<p>The end of a cow is steak; the end of a lie is exposure.</p>
<p>If you don't wash your hands, you will be said to be dirty; if you wash your hands, you will be said to use too much water.</p>
<p>May your friendship be like the mouth and the hand; when the hand hurts, use the mouth to blow it, and when the mouth hurts, use the hand to rub it.</p>
<p>Before swallowing the food in your mouth, don't start the second bite.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat in Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(5) Repaying Kindness</p>
<p>Wei Cheng had never seen Cui Zhen act like this before, so he asked, "Sister Cui Zhen, what's the matter?" Cui Zhen glanced back at the oyster-shell windowpane, checking if anyone was outside, then looked at Wei Cheng and smiled, "I wanted to borrow some money from Brother Cheng. My uncle has already often troubled Brother Cheng, and now it's my turn, I really can't bring myself to ask." Wei Cheng never expected Cui Zhen to say this. After she said it, he actually felt relieved about everything. He didn't hesitate at all, afraid that if he hesitated, Sister Cui Zhen would think he was refusing. He said, "Of course, of course. Sister Cui Zhen is too kind, insisting on saying 'borrow'. Are you and I not family? How much do you need? Please tell me." Cui Zhen's face reddened and she said, "Brother Cheng, decide how much you think is appropriate." This sounded strange to Wei Cheng. Why should the person borrowing money have the lender decide the amount? He replied, "I don't know what Sister Cui Zhen needs it for, whether it's for pocket money or to buy fruit." Cui Zhen said, "Brother Cheng, please lend me ten dollars." Wei Cheng said, "Of course, of course. That's for pocket money." Wei Cheng immediately took out a five-dollar bill and five one-dollar bills from his pocket. He meant that if Cui Zhen needed pocket money, he should give her the smaller denominations. Cui Zhen took them, counted them, and also took out a square piece of yellow paper from her person, wrapped the bills in it, placed it on the table, and smiled, "Brother Cheng, please write 'Bian Cui Zhen' on it. This is my gift to my aunt to buy some tinfoil paper with."</p>
<p>At this point, Wei Cheng understood that Sister Cui Zhen wanted to borrow money to give a gift, so he said, "Sister Cui Zhen, why bother? The things you do for Shi De Tang, both responsible and hardworking, my mother already knows. Why do you still need to give a gift?" Wei Cheng wanted to tear off the yellow paper wrapping, but Cui Zhen wouldn't allow it. Four hands pressed down on the paper package. Cui Zhen said, "Brother Cheng, are you afraid I won't repay the money? I will repay it, unless my surname becomes Ye, then I won't give gifts. My surname is Bian now. Brother Cheng, you must let me give a gift. Please keep it a secret from my second aunt." Wei Cheng felt that Cui Zhen's reasons were strong and he couldn't refute her, so he took Cui Zhen's hands away, picked up a pen instead, and wrote the words "Respectfully Presented by Bian Cui Zhen" on the yellow paper package. He then took out the gift registry managed by the accountant, entered it in order, and smiled, "Sister Cui Zhen, I should thank you." (75)</p>
