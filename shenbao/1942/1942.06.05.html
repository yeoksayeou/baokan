<h3>三，敘利亞簡史（一）</h3>
<p>（一）楔子　美國專欄作家李普曼氏，在去年六月十日的紐約時報上寫過這樣的話：「這次大戰以來，英國在軍事上幾乎沒有採取過一次主動，事事追隨，處處落後。唯一算得採限主動的，只有這次（指去年六月八日）聯合自由法軍進攻敘利亞一事。</p>
<p>九四一年六月八日以前，叙利亞是個法國的委任統治地。那時克里特島已爲德軍所佔領，叙利亞境內的法國空軍根據地，也巳爲德國所利用。如果希特勒能利用這種形勢，迅速佔領叙利亞，那麼北可以威脅土耳其，東可以窺伺伊郎，伊拉克，南可以直下巴勒斯坦，進攻蘇彝士，近東的形勢早已不像今天這樣了。然而一年以來，近東的危機雖說還未消除，而英國在此的按制力究竟還未變動，所以致此者，一半固謂係受德蘇戰爭之賜，但英國去年六月八日的「先人一着」，也有一半的作用呢。</p>
<p>（二）往史的追憶</p>
<p>叙利亞是什麼樣的一個地方呢？歴史上的事跡在道裹是叙述不盡的。我們目節錄一段大英百科全書裹的紀載，作爲簡單的說明。</p>
<p>根據石器時代以及其他史前時代的遺物，作爲研究，我們可以知這叙利亞之有居民，實是爲時甚早。有史以來居於境內的民族，大多爲塞米族，彼此互相征伐。那時的政治，今已不能詳悉，但司知者，境內係屬小城邦紛立之局，政務操於貴族之手。紀元前十六世紀半之後，才有南北之分，彼此各有一個系統，史家稱之爲迦南人（Oananite）歴代。迨紀元前一千年，阿拉密人（Aramean）佔領了南北叙利亞，又爲阿拉密人當代。在迦南人時代，叙利亞爲埃及與巴比倫文化交流之地，結果造成了一種別具色彩的西亞文化。但到了阿拉密人時代，其文化便極受希臘羅馬之影響，工藝如刺　，玻璃，陶瓷等都有極高的發展。叙利亞文化有一特點，即缺乏獨創性，但其勢力却所被甚廣，而於阿拉伯人之影響，尤爲深厚悠遠。阿拉伯人之書法，就是由叙利亞書法演變而來的。</p>
<p>紀元前八世紀以後，叙利亞便淪爲各民族侵服之地。在此之前，先有巴比倫與埃及之爭奪。到了紀元前三三二年，則有馬其頓人之侵入。迨亞歷山大帝東侵，全境便為希臘所侵服，希臘人在此所建之城市，於叙利亞歴史機關重要。紀元前六十四年，龐貝佔領其地，僅阿拉伯族之那巴得人在北部負隅不屈，且歴時頗久。可是到了後來，叙利亞也終而成爲羅馬帝國的一個省份。紀元後六一六年，叙利亞爲波斯人所侵入，而六二二至六二八年，復歸於東羅馬帝國。六三六年以後，又輾轉入於回敎徒之手。回敎王朝雖年年多事，但叙利亞在此時仍能保持其繁榮。只是到了蒙古人西征，境內悉受破壞，自此之後，昔日的繁榮便與叙利亞畏期告別了。十五世紀初年，奧托曼人奪得敘利亞，自此敘利亞便成為土耳其帝國之一部，而至於上次世界大戰。</p>
<p>中古之世，敘利亞為歐洲與東方通商之要道。及紅海闢航，其重要性益爲增加。只是到了蘇彝十通航。牠的地位便爲後者所奪了。</p>
<p>（三）阿拉伯的鬥爭</p>
<p>上段所舉的，只是一段有史以來而至上次大戰以前的叙利亞簡略的歴史。在此應該補充的，叙利亞自成了土耳其帝國的一部以後，境內住的多是阿拉伯人，他們雖身受土耳其的統治，但無時無刻爲建立阿拉伯國家而鬥爭。到了上次世界大戰爆發，這個鬥爭的烽火便燒遍了整個的近東。英國牛津大學阿拉伯問題專家吉伯敎授，會作了「阿拉伯國家的集團」一文，對此叙述甚詳，我們且引其中之一段於次：</p>
<p>近東各地都是阿拉伯人鬥爭的根據地，而叙利亞則爲其中心。他們陶醉在阿拉伯的傳統和阿拉伯帝國的光榮裹，夢想着有一天他們總可以獲得復興。在土耳其帝國的長期酣眠狀態中，這一種精神似乎巳經消減了。幸虧有阿拉伯言語和文學遺產的存在，方才維持着阿拉伯人和土耳其入中間的畛域。有許多傑出的阿拉伯人，在土耳其的軍隊和政府裹任職。他們和土耳其一樣，也產生了民族思想的潮流。一九四一｜一八年歐戰發生，他們認爲機會已經到了，中經英法兩國向麥加當局幹旋的結果，於是阿拉伯民族主義的領袖，便參加了推翻土耳其統治的工作，而形成了創立阿拉伯的統一國家的光聲。</p>
<p>叙利亞境內的阿拉伯人，和其他地方的阿拉伯人起而反抗土耳其以後，英法當局便於一九一八年十一月發表宣言，其中寫着這樣的保證：</p>
<p>近東方面，昔日會被土耳其壓迫的各民族，今後當全部解放。此後近東名民族所組成的政府，將完全由當地民衆選舉出來。此種政府須尊重人民意旨，其戚信也必將與日俱增。</p>
<p>這個保證當然會更使阿拉伯人聞風而起，因以襲擊士兵，破壞軍用鐵路的事件，便接踵而起，叙利亞境內的破壞行動，更見劇烈。許多的阿拉伯人，爲此身受重刑，可是千千萬萬的人民還是繼着邁進。這是阿拉伯人血肉的鬥爭，他們認爲：祇要能把土耳其帝國打倒，他們也就可償數白年來的夙願了。</p>
<p>司是大戰結束以後，事實便完全出乎阿拉伯人的意料。就近東而言，伊拉克是歸給英國了，巴勒斯坦名義上爲國際共管，實則和外約丹一樣，也同爲英國所掌握。沙地阿拉伯和阿曼也居於英人的胯下，剩下來的叙利亞，便成爲法國的委任統治地。（未完）</p>

<p>新訂車價計增三倍</p>
<p>上海電車公司昨亦發表通告、略謂公司方面因電費漲價、共他各物一致昂貴、不得巳自今︽五）日起修正票價、新價H表可望於今日揭示車輛中、以便乘客參閱、此項新價、係以儲備券爲本位、惟在本月八日前乘客仍得以中中交法幣支付、而依二比一換率計算、新價目表詳情、迄至發稿時止、猶未能探悉、惟據該公司某職員透露、頭等票價約爲舊價之三倍、三等票價之漲起、則無如是之大、且此次加價並無一定標準、三等最低一角五分（儲券）、最高四角五分、頭等最低三角、最高七角、又該公司月季票、原價爲法幣三十二元及二十二元兩種、今起亦改收儲券、</p>

<h3>留滬西人愛美國劇團A．D．C．「李查王三世」的演出</h3>
<p>— 白熊</p>
<p>初夏的太陽，好像今年第一次到上海（一日）。當記者面對着她，向邁爾西愛路蒲石路口的蘭心大戲院進發的時候，身上一陣烘熱，眼前耀着眩目的陽光，不知怎的會有這樣一個感覺——好像霉季已經消逝，又好像霉雨還潛伏着，不，霉季還沒有來到呢？當跨進道有歷史性的AI）C戲團老家——蘭心大戲院時，幻想佔據了整個思潮。</p>
<p>一直等到聽到了那位飾李查的主角，E　G　Smith—Wright鏗鏘地讀出第二行台詞時——「…Made　Glorious　Summer　by　ThisSun　of　Your…」好像被喚醒了過來，才注意這目的物—「李查王三世」的演出。</p>
<p>這是倫敦的街景，當時李查只是格羅司脫公爵的頭銜，在這幕啟後的獨白中，我們就知道了他的野心，「戲」就在這裹演進下去了。</p>
<p>全劇一共是四幕，十七傷，以這在上海具有七十五年演出歴史的ADC劇團，來上演這一齣沙翁的名劇，效果自然相當成功的。加上近代物質條件的完善，這個歴史劇的現象化，不僅要比沙翁時代自己的圓形草台Globe　Theatre　上的演出，要好上萬倍，就是和ADC劇團本身，在一八六七年第一次在這裏上演的「浮士德」比較起來，恐怕他們自己也會誇言說「進步得多了！「</p>
<p>因爲劇本的本身是在叙述李查王三世的產生及其沒落，所謂「The</p>
<p>Lifeand　Death　of　The　Soverieg」，所以全劇的「戲」，要側重在演李查王的主角一個人身上。</p>

<h3>如何抑平物價</h3>
<p>— 波動</p>
<p>因爲幣制的更變，市面上真是一日數驚，所謂「早晚市價不同」，現在真是應騐了。</p>
<p>據規定，中儲票與舊法幣是二與一之比，但除了電影院乎劇院是貨真價實的减半之外，那一樣東西不是加上幾成的；有的簡直在原價上加盡了「新法幣」的監印。</p>
<p>一家白貨商店的老闆對我說，他是五十萬元下本的，幣制史變以後，他的資本就减了爲二十五萬元，如果把店裹的貨品仍舊二對一作價，不是就虧本了二十五萬元嗎？所以明降暗升，實任也有不得已的苦衷。我起初是點點頭，非常同情他的聲述，繼而一想，他那店舖至少開了四年了，在這四年中，祇有賺錢沒有虧本是必然的，而且他的資本已經變了商品，即使有若干流動金在手頭，或存在銀行裹，則在幣制上的損失，怎及得在貨品上的盈餘呢？</p>
<p>事實擺在面前，一切的理由都是多餘的，現在是祇有窮者愈窮，富者愈富。再舉個例罷，有一個靠存息生活的老人，他流着眼淚說：我的存款愈存愈少了，然而生活程度却漲上了三五十倍！你能說這不是事實嗎？</p>
<p>現在尚在新舊交替之時，等到舊法幣完全停止使用之日，我想市面上將有更大的變動，所以如何抑平物價，是到了最後關頭了。</p>
<h3>學店停辦有感</h3>
<p>— 匡成</p>
<p>最近法租界某小學發生風潮，雖說原因複雜，但唯利是圖的學店老闆們見了，都不免有鬼死狐悲之感。今日之下，辦敎育與生意經，似乎不能兩全了。</p>
<p>數年以來，學店老闆頗出風頭，有一所弄堂小學在手，賺錢是不成問題的，會打算的校長，還可大發其財呢！</p>
<p>生活多變，物價不斷地高漲，同時還要軋米軋煤……學生們非但無力讀齊，簡直是無暇讀書了：而且許多人都回了鄉，本學期學生數目已少了三分之一，下學期的情形更不堪設想。一般人都以爲塞飽肚皮巳屬幸事，求學且放在腦後，這樣却使學店老闆惶惶然了。</p>
<p>敎員方面，到今天還是一百餘元的薪金，每期按十個月計算。除非粉筆屑可以充飢，他們才有活的希望，敎員們就紛紛脫離敎書匠生活而改行了，其餘的也是混一天是一天，到了月底，照例向校長提出一次加薪的請求，於是聘不到好敎員又成了校長們的難題。</p>
<p>有幾個學校，校長雖然精明，拚命節省開支，甚至將校役辭退，雜事由敎員和學生們動手，但是收入大减，總無完善的辦法。</p>
<p>朋友某君，是一位十足的敎育商人，前幾年租下一幢石庫門房子，開設一所弄堂小學。敎室祇有兩間，三樓以善價出租。敎員祇有兩人，一切的校務，都托給一位忠實可靠的</p>
<p>生活報告</p>
<h3>檢點消毒牛奶</h3>
<p>— 僅</p>
<p>我是－個牛奶公司的小職員。天未亮是我起身發奶的時候，各路區的送奶人，都帶了脚踏車在等待我發奶，點瓶是最繁瑣的－件事，因為數目多常易忽略而點錯、少了，那驪送奶人是學向你冉取的；可是多了呢，他們也不響起的就這樣過去了。于是結賬時吃虧的就要輪到我。發罷奶另一日作，是要到冷氣間內點存奶的多少，冷氣間的溫度在攝氏三十多度下，這是非常不舒適的冷度。尚使衣服穿得少些，就易傷風受寒，尤其在熱天最易忽略。在冷氣間逗留了半小時後，此後可以憇息的睡睡。八時許是遂奶人回來的時間，他們要報告那幾家停送，和加送。有時工部局向送奶人抽拔．瓶牛奶，携至衛生處化騐，過幾天有報告給我們。細菌若是超出了預定數，就要受警告。老板受了警告，就要責罵我們對於燒奶的不注意。我們怎樣來注意着呢：牛奶用蒸氣蒸至一百四十五度使病菌消滅，這是消毒的原則。消毒好的牛奶，西經過冷氣的亂板變冷，入裝瓶器，然後開始裝瓶，這些瓶也耍經過幾步手續的先。裝瓶在熟諗的技術工人下裝得很快。經過半機械的連續工程就可把二三千瓶的東西都打好了，經過我的查點。冷氣間內鑰匙是我的護身符，當常備在身邊，遺失責任就重大了。因爲那鎖都是非常特別而不易配到的。此後餘下的時間要做奶間報告單和產量表，物價高漲下，牛奶也經過幾次的增價，但是上海究竟是好像沒有窮人的所在，在電話不斷聲中，飲戶一天要增加六七十戶，這樣太使我們咋舌了。</p>
<h3>善舉</h3>
<p>— 爕</p>
<p>高價收買，平價出售</p>
<p>敎務主任，他自己却成天成日在團積上用功夫，因爲利用學校，囤積紙張文具，旣方便又容易討便宜。</p>
<p>本學期開始時，獲利要少一倍，辦畢校沒有出息，這位會打算盤的老闆又打定了主意，暑假後可以停辦，好在有一幢房子，做二房東並不會差。</p>
<p>近來，他完全失望了，二房東如今一落千丈，收了小費便要吃官司，多收房租又是遠法。</p>
<p>算了又算，覺得這一所小學校若要繼續下去，除非漲一倍的學費，即使學生少些，也有餘利，其實學費早已漲到無可再漲，再加一倍，簡直要無人問津了，所以他又轉念出讓學校生財，去做別的生意。</p>
<p>學店老闆再也打不起如意算盤來，平日缺乏辦敎育的精神，如今受到這個打擊，索性罷手，許多學校，在這學期告終時，就宣告結束，學生們失學問題，大多置之不顧。</p>
<p>我們雖不必幸災樂禍，可是這種商業化的學校停辦，對於社會並沒有什麼損失，所可惜的同時要大衆關心的，是敎員的失業，學生的失學。</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（五）拔來報往</p>
<p>菜二太太道：「這是你媽給她做的，是深一藍色的綢面子，做了捨不得穿，一直放在我們家裏。我說她願意往上海去，一半也許是為了有這件衣服。」維城臉上又露着一些笑意了。葉二太太有個妹妹，沒出閣，病在家裏。葉二太太這些時，一直忙着葉大太太的喪事，不部回去看過她一次；現在得了閒，就想去看看。維城道：「嬸娘，你回去看看二姨。家裏沒有什麼事了，便是有事，我也能對付下來。』幾天，天不下雨，等天下了雨，田裏才有事。坐自己家裏的小船，何子與搖船。嬸娘也不一定要忙回來，在張家舅舅家裏住個兩三天沒關係。葉二太太道：「那麼我就去。維城，你在家裹着看書，氣悶了，就在院子裹，再不然，外邊空塲上，散散步。別出去。」維城道：「一切我都知道。」葉二太太走雖然走，還吟咐喜鵲，吩咐何媽，吩咐阿興，都叫他們當心少爺的事：然後讓何子興搖船，回十里外的娘家去。</p>
<p>維城痴痴的站在他父母遺像面前，站得不到一分鐘，喜鵲在背後說道：「二太太叫少爺看書的，少爺，你看書吧。」維城道：「我的事，你不耍管。」他走到了國芳和翠珍隔晚住的房裹，看見雪花花膏的瓶子開了，瓶蓋老遠的扔在窗　上，拿起雪花膏瓶子聞r聞，心裹一蕩。喜鵲又在背後說道：「二太太叫少爺在大鬥裹走走，少爺怎麼走到這裹來了？」維城道：「你又要管我的事，小姐們用過了的化妝品，你倒不來收拾收拾。」</p>
<p>第二天，維城一個人在計劃着今年如何改良春耕方法，把家裹所有的田，畫了一張圖出來，那裹是河道，那裹有樹木，那一塊是空地，那一塊是麥田。麥田就畫上麥，空地就讓他空白，畫了一陣，想抽一枝烟，把一枝烟撈在手裹。阿與倐的嗤－聲，擦着－根火柴給他點。維城道：「你在屋子裹，我不知道。」阿興笑道：「少爺，你在畫什麼？前回大太太在世時，家裹掛上了好些畫軸，綠的紅的都有，怎麼少爺畫的，只是拿鉛筆畫上些線？」維城吸了一口烟道：「你不懂，我又不是畫畫，我畫的是家裹的田。你在這裹更好了，這老墳地前面的，是幾畝？」　（九四）</p>
<h3>閒與忙</h3>
<p>— 沉靜</p>
<p>字彙中儘多着相對的字眼，諸如：「是非」，一黑白」，「富貴貧賤」……等等。</p>
<p>但有時忽然「是非」不明，「黑白一混淆，於是人類也有了「富貴」與一貧賤」之分。更因此產生了一雙不同的字眼·「閒與「忙」。有些人仗着勢財終日優哉游哉，過他閒適的生活；另有些人則被窮困飢寒無情地鞭策着，勒逼他鎮日夜絕無停止地辛勤忙碌。</p>
<p>時至今日，所謂「閒」與「忙」又似乎有些改變。一方面「閒」的果然更加閒下來，無聊到整天整晚聽戲玩女人，「忙」的又這着加倍忙下去，連响晚也無休憩的機會，抱住被角提心吊胆地守在米店門前；但另一方面，「閒」的又靜極思動，盡畫走棋之餘，被市面的波動吸引得眼紅起來，因之買賣市傷父平添不少驀生的人頭，於是乎「閒」朋友開始忙」了。　這一「忙」幫助物價「昇天」，「看漲」一語傳播千里。工廠老闆旣將製成品按住不放，靜觀其再變；原料也無須煩心，且讓堆積成山，機器「突然損壞，一俟修理完竣，再行開工」多好？於是乎鎮日夜爲他人造福的「忙」朋友，如今却不得不賦閒下來。</p>
<p>「閒」與「忙」原是人類一手「創造」的，要消滅當然還須仰仗人類。消減它們之最有効方法，那就莫過於努力揩拭去字典中一切相對的字眼。</p>

<p>一個朋友是研究生物學的，他在實騐室裹用慣了顯微鏡，因而對於仟何事情，他都以「顯微鏡」的方式來觀察。</p>
<p>從前，他往往會很得意的告訴我，任何事情在顯微鏡下都無法掩飾牠的醜態，你看，那可怕的微生蟲正是害人的惡魔。</p>
<p>然而，近來他不再有笑容了，原因是在他狹隘的顯微鏡的觀察下，祇有醜惡，絕望，沒有一絲生的希望，他憤怒得幾乎摔掉那顯微鏡。</p>
<p>「理智一些，」我誠摯地勸告他：「顯微鏡下的1切固然都是事實，但是單用顯微鏡來觀察是不够的，在牠狹隘的鏡頭下，祇能看到局部的，片面的現實。拿起顯微鏡，同時還要拿起望遠鏡，向後回顧一下，再向前面的遠處瞻望，那麼，所謂「醜惡」「絕望」不過是暫時的，局部的現象而巳，在遠處是有生的希望的。」</p>
<p>但是，他還不瞭解，「現實分明是醜惡的，絕望的，雖說遠處有生的曙光，然而什麼是達到生的路途呢？」</p>
<p>我勸他冉有「X光」的透視的方法，去觀察呈現在顯微鏡下的一切醜惡，發掘事實的本質，就不難獲得醜惡的根源與剷除醜惡的方法，這樣，一切就豁然了，我們的視綫再不會給現象所蒙蔽了。</p>
<p>於是，這位朋友離開了他的實騐室，拿起顯微鏡和望遠鏡，同時還把握住透視的方法，不久，我重新看到他的笑容了。</p>

Another route of the Japanese army launched a major southward advance towards Quzhou, reaching the opposite bank of the Qujiang River three kilometers north of Quzhou. The artillery fire was intense, gradually gaining the upper hand. The Japanese army, having broken through the defending forces' positions and appearing on the Quzhou plain, intercepted from the southeast and southwest, overlooking the city walls of Quzhou, and are now engaged in a final decisive battle with the Quzhou defenders.</p>
<p>United Press, Shanghai Dispatch: According to reports from the Zhejiang front, the Japanese army launched a fierce attack on the southeastern part of Quzhou starting on the 3rd. By the evening of the same day, they had broken through the western position of Dazhou Town. The Japanese army on the north bank of the Qujiang River, advancing rapidly from the northeast of Quzhou, continued to seize positions and launched a long-distance attack towards Dou Tou Mountain, seven kilometers west of Quzhou. All units of the Japanese army advanced towards Quzhou, and their vanguard is now pressing close to the city of Quzhou.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 4th Day, United Press: After the Japanese army launched a general offensive against the Quzhou defenders on the 3rd with air and ground coordination, they finally broke through the Zhejiang battle line in two directions and advanced rapidly into the Quzhou plain.

<h3>Both Germany and the Soviet Union Claim the Front Lines Are Generally Quiet; Germany Still Plans to Advance on Moscow; Final Batch of Italian Blackshirts Headed to the Eastern Front</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 3rd Day, Havas: Today, both Germany and the Soviet Union issued war reports stating that the Eastern Front is generally quiet. The wording of their reports is similar, marking the first time in the past three weeks. In the past, their statements invariably contradicted each other. Of course, there are still some sporadic battles on various fronts, all of which are skirmishes and none of which affect the overall situation. Last night, Moscow broadcast mentioned that Soviet forces had launched an offensive on Lake Ilmen, but did not specify the details. It is likely that the scope is not large. In the Kharkov area, there is only patrolling. The German army is currently carrying out mopping-up operations. However, the Soviet communique stated that Soviet forces had recaptured the area of Verkhnii Byk, south of Kharkov. In addition, the Soviet Air Force is extremely active in southern Finland, especially over Kotka, as the area is a crucial hub for German reinforcements to the Finnish front and is of great importance. However, the Soviet side seems to have only sent a small number of aircraft to participate in the air raids, and the damage to the Finnish military is minimal. According to observations by military experts, the current lull on the Eastern Front is unlikely to last. A major battle will resume within days, which, although not necessarily decisive, will certainly indicate the trend of victory.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 3rd Day, Havas: The battle of Kharkov has in fact ended. It is expected that the central sector will be the focus of attention for all parties. According to the latest news, the German army seems to be preparing to begin its advance on Moscow. At that time, German forces in all areas of the central sector will participate in the fighting. The initial German action is to attack the city of Rzhev. However, fierce fighting is currently taking place in the Kalinin area in the north. According to Soviet claims, the Red Army has seized strategically advantageous positions from the German army. In addition, the German side has also concentrated a large army in the Bryansk area, preparing to launch a major offensive. At the same time, the air forces of both sides are extremely active.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th Day, Reuter: Military sources here claimed last night that the German army's victory in Kharkov and Donets had now restored the situation to what it was before Timoshenko launched his offensive. The German army not only occupied many bridgeheads across the Donets, but also extended most of the front lines to the east of the Donets.</p>
<p>Rome, 4th Day, Reuter: The final batch of Italian Blackshirts has already departed for the Eastern Front. The Chief of Staff of the Fascist Militia, representing Mussolini, went to the station to see them off. The crowds also cheered and paid their respects at the station. Mussolini recently inspected this group of Blackshirts.</p>
<p>Brussels, 4th Day, Reuter: According to reports from here, another batch of Flemish volunteers has departed for the Eastern Front. The "Flemish Guard" sent three companies, organizing a ceremonial guard, to the station to see them off.</p>

<p>Rome, 4th Day, Reuter: According to sources close to the Romanian government, President Roosevelt's request to Congress to pass a bill declaring war against Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria did not come as a surprise to Romania. Romania and the United States have been at war for months. The American declaration of war is only a formal recognition of this state of war. When the Soviet Union invaded Bessarabia in 1940, the Romanian people should have recovered the lost territory and continued to fight to eliminate the threat from the east and destroy Bolshevism. Participating in this battle is Romania's obligation and will not be prevented by any measures taken by the American government.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 4th Day, Reuter: Political circles in Washington believe that President Roosevelt's message to Congress requesting a declaration of war against Bulgaria is a sign of friendship between the United States and the Soviet Union.

The London Daily Mail stated that the US declaration of war on Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania is a warning to Finland. The post-war status of Rowland is being discussed by Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union.</p>

<h3>North African Intense Heat and Sandstorm: The War Continues to Develop, the Battle on the Gazala Line Nears its Climax, Germany and Britain Seek to Maintain Supply Lines</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Associated Press): The Libyan sandstorms are hindering military operations on both sides, but the battles on the east and west sides of the Gazala Line are now rapidly approaching their most intense point. It is reported that the British new sharp tanks have begun desperate attacks to drive out the African divisions of German General Rommel's forces. According to sources in Cairo, the battle is taking place in scorching heat above 100 degrees, and it is generally believed that the outcome will determine whether the German army can hold the area east of Sayna and Merichi. British air operations are hampered by sandstorms, and the attacks of armored forces are also greatly slowed down. Visibility on the battlefield is only twenty yards at noon, and nothing can be seen face-to-face at dusk. However, the war is still proceeding on a large scale. London says that General Rommel is now determined to seize Bir Hakeim and has gained a foothold in the center of the British positions, while maintaining the accessibility of the supply line to the west. The British army is targeting this supply line for attack.</p>
<p>German Supreme Headquarters, 4th (Havas): This afternoon's German military report stated that many more enemy soldiers were captured in North Africa, and twenty-two tanks and seven artillery pieces were destroyed. German and Italian air forces bombed railway facilities and military camps in Gafsa.</p>
<p>Rome, 4th (Havas): Today's communique from the Italian military headquarters stated that the battle of Marmarica yesterday was favorable to our army. The enemy destroyed twenty-four tanks and seven artillery pieces and captured many prisoners. Axis air forces bombed railway facilities and depots in Gafsa. Motorcade was bombed heavily. The enemy's nest was fiercely bombed by German aircraft. Five British Curtis aircraft were shot down. Two of our planes did not return to their original defenses. A British air force team was intercepted by German fighter planes over Pantelleria, losing five Spitfire British planes. Enemy planes attacked Augusta, and anti-aircraft guns shot down one enemy plane.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 4th (Havas): According to sources in London, the North African battlefield is currently encountering intense heat and sandstorms, but the war is still developing. According to an editorial in The Times, the Axis forces have not yet been defeated, and the enemy's tank divisions appear to have ample ammunition and reserves. Although the main force of the enemy is in retreat, it is unknown whether the British Eighth Army can take advantage of this strategic advantage to pursue the enemy. The Eighth Army may suffer heavy losses in this hot battle. It is reported that the Axis forces have been able to expand their corridor in the British minefield and establish a position in the east. According to the British, the position has been besieged by the British army.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Libyan Front, 3rd (Havas): The new offensive launched by German General Rommel, commander-in-chief of the German army in North Africa, against the British army yesterday may be the beginning of the second phase of the Axis army's offensive in North Africa. Fierce battles have broken out near Knightsbridge and El Adem. However, when the Axis forces launched a new offensive, the British army also launched a frontal attack on the main German-Italian line. The results of the two sides' offensives are still unknown. However, one thing is certain: the two gaps that the German army broke through in the British positions have merged into one, with a very large area. The German army at the eastern end of the gap has also greatly increased. Some military experts believe that General Rommel's new offensive is a kind of protection for the infantry, so that its main force can advance westward and maintain the gap in the British position until the Axis forces fighting south of Knightsbridge arrive. In short, the future war situation will depend on whether the Axis countries can concentrate their forces to attack Tobruk, or whether the British army can advance westward. It is also heard that the US's four tanks have been very active in North Africa.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Havas): According to well-informed military sources here last night, "It is too early to draw conclusions about the final outcome of the North African war." British reports also show the same opinion, and the results of the war are also very vague. However, German and Italian military reports reported the capture of 2,000 and 3,000 British soldiers respectively, which shows that the enemy has been greatly hit.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Havas): The German Supreme Headquarters announced last night that German dive bombers bombed a British vehicle concentration point south of Tobruk and motorized troops on the coastal highway on Tuesday night. The air raid lasted for an hour, and countless enemy vehicles were destroyed.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 4th (Havas): According to this question to London, the North African war situation remains unchanged. British officials have confirmed that General Rommel has merged the two gaps broken through in the British minefield into one large gap of sixteen kilometers to prevent British artillery from the side.</p>

<p>Berlin, 4th (Havas): The German Supreme Headquarters announced that in the German-British air battle over the English Channel yesterday afternoon, German aircraft shot down 24 British aircraft that are known. A team of British bombers, under the protection of fighter planes, attempted to invade the airspace near Sheerness, but before reaching the French coast, they were ambushed by German aircraft. After a brief engagement, 16 British aircraft were shot down. Afterwards, the British aircraft attacked again and were shot down by German aircraft. As a result, the British aircraft did not dare to peep into the French coast again. Of the 24 British aircraft, four were shot down by Lieutenant Schneel, who has now shot down a total of 61 enemy aircraft.</p>

<p>Berlin, 4th (Havas): An authoritative source here last night officially stated that since air raids began in Germany, the total number of casualties is about 8,000. The rumors spread by the British and Americans that Cologne was raided last Saturday, killing 20,000 people, are completely inaccurate. As far as is known, only about 200 people were killed in the city. According to statistics, the average number of deaths and injuries in Germany due to traffic accidents is about 7,000 to 8,000 per year.</p>
<p>London, 3rd (Havas): The Air Ministry has issued a communique stating that the British Air Force flew to the French occupied zone 7,700 times in the past month.</p>

<p>Berlin, 4th (Havas): Regarding the German air force's retaliatory bombing of Canterbury, the German Supreme Headquarters announced that when several batches of German aircraft attacked the city, the sky was clear and cloudless. Although many enemy fighter planes flew up to intercept, the German aircraft still flew to the center of the city and dropped bombs, and many places in the city caught fire.

<h3>Three, A Brief History of Syria (1)</h3>
<p>(1) Introduction: American columnist Walter Lippmann wrote the following words in the New York Times on June 10 last year: "Since this war, Britain has hardly taken a single initiative in military affairs, following everything and lagging behind everywhere. The only thing that can be considered an initiative is the joint attack on Syria by the Free French forces (referring to June 8 last year)."</p>
<p>Before June 8, 1941, Syria was a French mandate. At that time, Crete had been occupied by the German army, and the French air bases in Syria had also been used by Germany. If Hitler could use this situation to quickly occupy Syria, then in the north he could threaten Turkey, in the east he could spy on Iran and Iraq, and in the south he could go straight to Palestine and attack Suez. The situation in the Near East would have been different from today. However, although the crisis in the Near East has not yet been eliminated for a year, and Britain's control here has not changed, half of the reason for this is due to the German-Soviet war, but the British "preemptive move" on June 8 last year also played a part.</p>
<p>(2) Recollections of the Past</p>
<p>What kind of place is Syria? The historical events in the Taoist temple cannot be described exhaustively. We will excerpt a paragraph from the Encyclopedia Britannica as a simple explanation.</p>
<p>Based on the study of Stone Age and other prehistoric relics, we can know that Syria has been inhabited for a very long time. The ethnic groups that have lived in the territory since historical times have mostly been Semitic, fighting each other. The politics of that time cannot be known in detail now, but it is known that the territory belonged to a situation of small city-states standing side by side, and the government affairs were in the hands of the nobles. After the middle of the 16th century BC, there was a division between the north and the south, each with a system, which historians call the Canaanites (Oananite). In the first millennium BC, the Arameans occupied northern and southern Syria, and were the Aramean dynasty. During the Canaanite era, Syria was a place for cultural exchange between Egypt and Babylon, resulting in a distinctive West Asian culture. But in the Aramean era, its culture was greatly influenced by Greece and Rome, and crafts such as embroidery, glass, and ceramics were highly developed. A characteristic of Syrian culture is its lack of originality, but its influence is very broad, and its influence on the Arabs is particularly profound and far-reaching. The Arabic calligraphy is derived from Syrian calligraphy.</p>
<p>After the 8th century BC, Syria became a place invaded by various ethnic groups. Before this, there was a struggle between Babylon and Egypt. In 332 BC, the Macedonians invaded. When Alexander the Great invaded the east, the entire territory was invaded by the Greeks. The cities built by the Greeks here are important in the history of Syria. In 64 BC, Pompey occupied the area, only the Nabataeans of the Arab tribe resisted stubbornly in the north, and it lasted for a long time. But later, Syria finally became a province of the Roman Empire. In 616 AD, Syria was invaded by the Persians, and from 622 to 628, it returned to the Eastern Roman Empire. After 636, it was transferred to the hands of Muslims. Although the Islamic dynasties were eventful every year, Syria was still able to maintain its prosperity at this time. Only when the Mongols conquered the west, the territory was destroyed. Since then, the prosperity of the past has said goodbye to Syria. In the early 15th century, the Ottomans seized Syria. Since then, Syria has become a part of the Turkish Empire until the last world war.</p>
<p>In the Middle Ages, Syria was an important route for trade between Europe and the East. With the opening of the Red Sea route, its importance increased. Only when the Suez Canal opened, its position was taken by the latter.</p>
<p>(3) The Arab Struggle</p>
<p>The above is just a brief history of Syria since historical times and before the last world war. What should be added here is that after Syria became a part of the Turkish Empire, most of the people living in the territory were Arabs. Although they were under Turkish rule, they struggled to establish an Arab state at all times. When the last world war broke out, the flames of this struggle spread throughout the Near East. Professor Gibb, an expert on Arab affairs at Oxford University in Britain, wrote an article entitled "The Group of Arab Countries", which describes this in detail. Let us quote one of the paragraphs below:</p>
<p>The Near East is the base of the Arab struggle, and Syria is its center. They are intoxicated with the Arab tradition and the glory of the Arab Empire, dreaming that one day they will be able to achieve revival. During the long sleep of the Turkish Empire, this spirit seemed to have diminished. Fortunately, the existence of the Arab language and literary heritage has maintained the boundary between the Arabs and the Turks. Many outstanding Arabs served in the Turkish army and government. Like the Turks, they also produced a trend of national thought. When the European War broke out in 1941-1948, they believed that the opportunity had arrived. As a result of the intervention of the British and French governments to the authorities in Mecca, the leader of Arab nationalism participated in the work of overthrowing Turkish rule, and formed the glorious voice of creating a unified Arab state.</p>
<p>After the Arabs in Syria and other places rose up to resist Turkey, the British and French authorities issued a declaration in November 1918, which contained the following guarantee:</p>
<p>In the Near East, all ethnic groups that were oppressed by Turkey in the past will be completely liberated in the future. After that, the governments formed by the ethnic groups in the Near East will be completely elected by the local people. Such governments must respect the will of the people, and their credibility will also increase day by day.</p>
<p>This guarantee will of course make the Arabs rise up in response, so incidents of attacking soldiers and destroying military railways have followed one after another, and the destructive actions in Syria have become more intense. Many Arabs have suffered heavy penalties for this, but thousands of people continue to move forward. This is the bloody struggle of the Arabs. They believe that as long as they can overthrow the Turkish Empire, they can realize their long-cherished wish for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>But after the end of the war, the facts were completely beyond the Arabs' expectations. As far as the Near East is concerned, Iraq was given to Britain, Palestine was nominally under international co-management, but in fact, like Outer Jordan, it was also controlled by Britain. Saudi Arabia and Oman were also under the control of the British, and the remaining Syria became a French mandate. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>It is Reported that Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are Conducting Important Negotiations: The Soviet Union Urges the Opening of a Second Battlefield Again, and the British Minister of Wartime Production Arrives in the United States</h3>
<p>Bern, Switzerland 3 (Havas): Newspapers here all carry news from London, claiming that although the war on the Eastern Front and in North Africa is becoming increasingly fierce, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are still conducting important negotiations to discuss various post-war issues. The Geneva Newspaper stated that the main purpose of Britain and the United States is to make the Soviet Union support the Atlantic Charter, because the principles stipulated in this charter do not completely coincide with the views of the Soviet Union. In order to make the Soviet government understand the views of Britain and the United States on the new world after the war, the governments of Britain and the United States intend to satisfy the Soviet Union's wishes in spirit or in other aspects, including recognizing that the coastal countries of the Baltic Sea will be incorporated into the Soviet Union's territory in the future. The United States' declaration of war on Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania is also a gesture to win the Soviet Union's favor. Recently, The Times published an article, strongly stating that the Atlantic Charter cannot only be the basis for economic concepts, but its main point is to urge the Soviet Union to agree to the principle that "all ethnic groups should enjoy the right to self-determination and autonomy." In addition, Lord Cranborne recently gave a speech in the House of Lords, saying that now is not the time for the British government to announce its war aims. The reason why Cranborne kept silent was probably because the British-American allies and the Soviet Union were still in talks.</p>
<h3>Indian Authorities Plan to Abolish Polygamy</h3>
<p>Lisbon 4th (Associated Press): According to news from Sri Delhi today, polygamy in India was originally permitted by Indian customs, but in civil law only monogamy is recognized as valid. Now the Indian authorities intend to pass a law to completely abolish polygamy, so that only monogamy is recognized in religious aspects. In addition, they also intend to promote women's rights, so that in some parts of India, where women are originally restricted from inheriting inheritance, the status of women is improved.</p>
<p>Washington, 3rd (Havas): According to well-informed sources, the Soviet Union has recently urged Britain and the United States to open a second battlefield in Europe this year. The Soviet government has expressed satisfaction with the large-scale bombing of Germany by British aircraft, but believes that it is still insufficient, as it cannot force Germany to transfer troops from the Eastern Front. The Soviet Union believes that it may not be able to resist the offensive of the million-strong army this summer by its own efforts alone, but it is convinced that if</p>
<p>Washington, 3rd (Havas): Officials announced today that British Minister of Wartime Cabinet Production, Richard Leese, has arrived here. Regarding the unification of production between Britain and the United States, Mr. Lee will discuss with the US Wartime Production Board Chairman Nelson and the People's Aid Law Implementation Commissioner Hopkins. According to official sources, Leese's trip may be related to the issue of opening a second battlefield in Europe.</p>
<h3>Explosion at a Mexican Ammunition Factory</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Havas): A telegram from Mexico City said that an ammunition factory managed by the government suddenly exploded yesterday morning, injuring several soldiers. The fire brigade poured water to rescue the fire for a long time before the fire was extinguished. The cause of the explosion has not yet been revealed.</p>

<h3>Two Tram Lines To Connect With Hongkou Today; One Line To Bazitang, The Other To Zhoujiazui; Tram Fares In Both Concessions To Increase Simultaneously Starting Today</h3>
<p>The English "Great Beauty Evening News" reported that traffic in the Public Concession would see improvement tomorrow (the 5th), as trams will run directly from Jing'an Temple to Hongkou Park, and from the southern end of the Bund, via the Waibaidu Bridge, to Zhoujiazui. This marks the first time since August 1937, eliminating the public's inconvenience of walking across the bridge. Simultaneously, tram fares in the Public Concession will double, payable in Central Reserve Bank notes (儲備券), whether south or north of the Suzhou River. This tram connection to Hongkou is a joint effort between the Public Concession Tram Company and the China Public Bus Company. Route 1 runs from Jing'an Temple to Hongkou Park, and Route 8 runs from the Bund to Zhoujiazui. Furthermore, trams will now be divided into two classes: the first car, whether in the blue or white section, will be first class; third class is limited to the trailer car. It is heard that the fare increase for third class will not be as significant as for first class. As for the French Concession's trams and trolleybuses, notices of the new Central Reserve Bank note fares, effective tomorrow, have been posted. It is noted that French Concession tram fares were increased just a few weeks ago. Now, calculated in Central Reserve Bank notes, the fare reduction is minimal, but the French tram company no longer accepts fen (分) coins, so fares may increase slightly by five fen to round up to the nearest jiao (角). The French Lei (雷) Tram Company will also accept undamaged jiao notes from the Central Bank of China (中中交) and the Bank of Communications (三行). It is heard that since the public bus and tram fares in the French Concession increased sharply starting Monday, ridership has decreased significantly, especially on public buses, which have seen a substantial drop in passengers.</p>
<p>New Fares Increased By Three Times</p>
<p>The Shanghai Tram Company also issued a notice yesterday, stating that due to rising electricity costs and the general increase in prices of other goods, the company has no choice but to revise its fares starting today (the 5th). The new fare schedule is expected to be displayed in the vehicles today for passengers to view. These new fares are based on reserve notes, but passengers can still pay with Chinese National Currency (法幣) at a rate of two-to-one until the 8th of this month. Details of the new fare schedule were not yet available at the time of writing. However, according to a company employee, the first-class fare will be about three times the old fare, while the third-class fare increase will not be as significant. Moreover, there is no fixed standard for this price increase; the lowest third-class fare is 1.5 jiao (reserve notes), and the highest is 4.5 jiao. The lowest first-class fare is 3 jiao, and the highest is 7 jiao. In addition, the company's monthly passes, originally priced at 32 yuan and 22 yuan in national currency, will now also be collected in reserve notes.</p>
<p>Tram Lines Connecting the North and South Areas</p>
<p>At the same time, the company announced that it will resume operation of Route 1 (Jing'an Temple to Hongkou Park) and Route 8 (Outer Yangjing Bridge to Yangshupu) starting today. Around 5:00 AM this morning, trams from the south of the Suzhou River and Hongkou will begin their first connection in five years since the Shanghai war. The rumble of trams will once again be heard on the Waibaidu Bridge. Furthermore, according to reporter inquiries, the Jing'an Temple tram depot will dispatch 18 trams to operate on Route 1, each with a second-class trailer car. The fare for the entire line from Jing'an Temple to Bazitang in Hongkou Park will be 7 jiao for first class and 4.5 jiao for third class. As for Route 8, it will be connected to the concession by the China Public Bus Company, and its vehicles will also be dispatched from the Hongkou area.</p>
<p>More Vehicles For The Convenience Of Citizens</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the company, after the north-south connection is established, there will be approximately 95 trams (including trailer cars) and over 125 trolleybuses operating on all major lines starting today. With the gradual decrease in available transportation, the only affordable means of transportation is the tram. As for how to improve passenger congestion, there is currently no good solution due to the imbalance between the number of people and vehicles.</p>
<p>Tram Fares Equal To Car Fares</p>
<p>Compared to the era when passengers used copper coins, there is a world of difference in fares compared to now. In the past, when copper coins were converted to silver dollars, the company's daily revenue was about 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Now, calculated in Central Reserve Bank notes, daily revenue has increased to 160,000 to 170,000 yuan. Although revenue has increased significantly, expenses have increased more than tenfold. For example, employee salaries alone have increased about eight to nine times, and the cost of supplies has increased by as much as several dozen times. Therefore, in terms of overall operation, it is not as good as before. As for passengers, riding the tram today is equivalent to hiring a car in the past.</p>
<p>Passengers Should Maintain Order When Boarding and Alighting</p>
<p>In addition, the tram company authorities stated that all passengers should maintain order when boarding and alighting. Those wishing to travel first class should board the front car at the driver's gate, while those traveling third class should board the trailer car at the rear, proceeding in an orderly manner to avoid crowding and reducing accidents. All passengers are requested to pay attention.</p>
<p>French Concession Tram Accepts Central Reserve Bank Notes</p>
<p>In addition, after the French Concession Tram and Lighting Company announced the cessation of accepting old national currency, tram fares have changed again, and starting today (the 5th), they will be based on Central Reserve Bank notes. The latest fare schedule was posted on all vehicles yesterday for passengers' information. According to reporter inquiries, the new fares are based on halving the national currency fares set on June 1 and converting them to Central Reserve Bank notes. If the conversion to Central Reserve Bank notes results in a remainder of five fen, another five fen will be added to round up to the nearest jiao, so fares will be slightly higher than before. The lowest third-class fare is one jiao in Central Reserve Bank notes, the lowest first-class fare is three jiao, and the highest first-class fare is seven jiao. Public bus fares have also been similarly converted to Central Reserve Bank notes. Furthermore, according to the English "Shanghai Times," the company authorities have instructed all ticket sellers to stop accepting all large national currency notes of one yuan or more, but auxiliary jiao notes from the Central Bank of China (中中交) and the Bank of Communications (三行) will still be accepted, while all fen notes will be refused.</p>
<h3>Domestic Remittance Handling Fees To Be Revised; Regulations On Collecting Various Handling Fees</h3>
<p>Datong News Agency reported that the Shanghai Savings and Remittance Bureau has revised the domestic remittance handling fees: Remittance notice fee: 1.6 jiao; Return receipt reissue fee: 5.2 jiao; Ordinary draft inquiry fee: (A) 3.2 jiao with submission of voucher; (B) 6.4 jiao for requesting submission of voucher and only being able to provide the draft number; 1 yuan if neither the draft nor the draft number can be provided; Duplicate draft reissue fee: 6.4 jiao; Revocation verification fee: 6.4 jiao; Draft amendment fee: 6.4 jiao; Fee for collecting draft at a post office other than the original paying office: 6.4 jiao; Fee for overdue draft payment: (A) Ordinary draft: 6.4 jiao; (B) Fixed-amount draft: 6.4 jiao; Airmail draft fee: 1.5 jiao; Telegraphic draft fee: 2.5 jiao; Collection of payment for goods: Collection of payment for goods fee: 6.2 jiao; Fee for changing the amount of payment for goods collected: 4.1 jiao; Additional payment for goods collection fee (i.e., handling fee for collecting packages in different locations): 3.2 jiao; Airmail remittance fee (i.e., fee for returning drafts for payment of goods collected by airmail): 2.5 jiao.</p>
<h3>Hotel and Photography Industries Demand Salary Increase; Negotiations Have Not Yet Yielded Results</h3>
<p>The entire staff of the Shanghai Hotel Industry Workers' Union recently made a request to the management for improved treatment, as the cost of living has increased and their original income is insufficient to make ends meet. After one round of negotiations, no resolution was reached due to differing conditions. Another negotiation was scheduled for the afternoon before yesterday, but the management representative was absent without notice, resulting in no progress.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the staff of photography studios in this city made a request for a salary increase at the beginning of last month due to the high cost of living. At that time, it was the beginning of the period for citizens to have their ID photos taken, and all the stores were extremely busy. Therefore, the management requested the staff's agreement to first increase the rice subsidy to 180 yuan per month, and to discuss the salary increase issue after the citizen ID photos were completed. Now that the workload in the stores has eased slightly, the management scheduled negotiations to be held yesterday. However, the labor representative was absent without notice, resulting in no progress. Negotiations will be rescheduled for another date.</p>
<h3>Various Old Auxiliary Currency Notes Temporarily Allowed to Circulate</h3>
<p>The Provisional Joint Committee of the Silver Coin Industry Association of this city has recently learned that small merchants and public utilities in this city are refusing to accept old auxiliary currency notes other than those issued by the Central Bank of China (中中交) and the Bank of Communications (三行), causing difficulties in making change in the market. They have sent a letter to the Old Currency Consolidation Committee and notified all association members. The reply is recorded below: It has been verified that the old auxiliary currency notes mentioned in Article 5 of the Regulations for Consolidating Old National Currency and Article 1 of the Detailed Measures for Recovering Old National Currency include all types of old auxiliary currency notes. Small merchants in this city and others do not understand the meaning of the articles and are refusing to accept old auxiliary currency notes other than those issued by the Central Bank of China (中中交) and the Bank of Communications (三行), causing difficulties in making change. This is a misunderstanding and should be immediately notified to the association members.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the circulation of old auxiliary currency notes, according to regulations, they are temporarily allowed to circulate at half the value of Central Reserve Bank auxiliary currency notes. However, the market still refuses to accept auxiliary currency notes of one jiao, two jiao, and five jiao, as well as one yuan, five yuan, and ten yuan notes issued by the Farmers Bank of China. It is heard that the Silver Coin Industry has requested that the Farmers Bank of China auxiliary currency notes be allowed to circulate to facilitate transactions in various industries. It is heard that the principle has been accepted, and they will be allowed to circulate at half the value of Central Reserve Bank auxiliary currency notes, with a formal announcement to be made soon. The disposal method for old Farmers Bank of China banknotes of one yuan or more will be determined separately, with the aim of reducing losses for the people.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Telephone Company Adjusts Telephone Prices; Effective from June 1</h3>
<p>According to the Allied News Agency, the Shanghai Telephone Company, which is under Japanese administration, will implement new adjusted prices starting from June 1. It has been decided to increase the current telephone fees, which are calculated in old national currency, by more than four times, and then halve them to collect reserve notes. The prices are as follows (calculated in reserve notes): New telephone installation: 50 yuan; Relocation outside the house: 50 yuan; Relocation inside the house: 20 yuan; Change of telephone number: 20 yuan; Installation fee for adding a telephone: 20 yuan; Public payphone: 0.2 jiao per call; Connecting to Zhabei telephone: 0.3 jiao per call; Business telephone: 26 yuan (ordinary phone), 28 yuan (table phone), limited to 100 calls per month. Additional calls beyond 100 per month: 0.18 jiao per call; Residential telephone: 17 yuan (ordinary phone), 19 yuan (table phone), limited to 65 calls per month. Additional calls beyond 65 per month: 0.18 jiao per call. Regarding the adjustment of telephone charges, the company stated that since the Greater East Asia War, the number of telephone subscribers has decreased by about 1,000, and the number of calls has also decreased by more than 30%. The decrease in revenue and the increase in commodity prices have led to an increase in expenses. The company's monthly revenue and expenses cannot be offset, resulting in significant losses. The charges for public utilities in the concession and all charges are calculated in reserve notes. Therefore, the telephone company's expenses are naturally also calculated in reserve notes. In order to improve the telephone system in the Shanghai area in the future, the required expenditure is expected to increase.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Cooked Food and Fried Cake Industry Association, located at No. 83, Maidie'an Road, Grand Bell, French Concession, has a total of 107 members. The membership fee is 2 yuan in national currency per member per month. Each member registered and was approved by the French Concession Food Management Committee. Each member was entitled to one bag of rationed flour, priced at 50 yuan, which was distributed by the association. However, the chairman of the association, Jia Ruwang, colluded with the accountant, Luo Ziliang, and employees Jiang Shunkang and Wu Jun, etc., to take out the flour. Only 71 bags were delivered to the members, and the remaining 36 bags were sold to others at a high price of 150 yuan per bag for joint profit sharing. This was discovered by members who had not yet received their flour and reported to the French police station. Detectives Ke Enqing, etc., arrested Jia, Luo, Jiang, and Wu. After investigation, the police station transferred the four people to the court. The French Concession administrative authorities filed a public lawsuit against them for joint embezzlement and fraud. When questioned, the defendants confessed to the charges. The court ordered that the case needed further investigation, and the defendants were remanded in custody pending further investigation. The defendants' request for bail was denied.</p>

<h3>Performance of Shakespeare's "Richard III" by the Amateur Dramatic Club (A.D.C.) for Westerners Staying in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— White Bear</p>
<p>The early summer sun seems to have arrived in Shanghai for the first time this year (for one day). As the reporter faced her and set off for the Lyceum Theatre at the intersection of Malixi Road and Pushi Road, a wave of heat swept over me, and the dazzling sunlight shone before my eyes. I don't know why I had such a feeling—it seemed as if the rainy season had passed, and as if the plum rain was still lurking, no, the rainy season hadn't even arrived yet? As I stepped into the old home of the historic A.D.C. theatre company—the Lyceum Theatre—fantasy took over my entire mind.</p>
<p>It wasn't until I heard the protagonist playing Richard, E. G. Smith-Wright, read the second line of the script sonorously—"...Made Glorious Summer by This Sun of Your..."—that I seemed to be awakened and noticed the object of my visit—the performance of "Richard III."</p>
<p>This is the street scene of London, and at that time Richard was only the Duke of Gloucester. In this opening monologue, we knew his ambition, and the "play" continued from here.</p>
<p>The whole play is divided into four acts and seventeen scenes. With the A.D.C. theatre company, which has a 75-year history of performing in Shanghai, staging this famous play by Shakespeare, the effect is naturally quite successful. Coupled with the improvement of modern material conditions, the representation of this historical drama is not only ten thousand times better than the performance on Shakespeare's own circular grass stage Globe Theatre, but also compared to the A.D.C. theatre company's own first performance of "Faust" here in 1867, they themselves would probably boast, "We've made a lot of progress!"</p>
<p>Because the script itself is about the birth and fall of Richard III, the so-called "The Life and Death of The Sovereign," the "play" of the whole play should focus on the protagonist playing Richard III.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Dance Hall Bloodshed; Inspector Xue Beat Dance Guest Chen Yunlai to Death</h3>
<p>The major bloodshed that occurred on the 2nd night at the Shanghai Dance Hall at No. 440 Guangdong Road has resulted in the arrest of three people by the police: the hall's dance girl class leader Lou Minwei and tea servant Shao Amao, etc. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Furthermore, detectives Liu Junjie and Chen Junfeng of the Lao Zha Police Station have arrested Xue Zhaoxiong, a Shanghai native (father's name Lin Lin) who was the hall's inspector. According to the investigation, the cause of the incident was roughly that a bank employee named Lin Siqing was in love with Shen Mei'ang, a dance girl in the hall. That night, he invited Chen Yunlai (deputy manager of Dechang Bank at No. 180 Minhang Road), who was later killed, and Sun Meitao, Zhou Jianming, and Chen Shugang to the dance hall to have fun. He ordered Shen Mei'ang to sit with them. Unexpectedly, another person suddenly danced with Shen during her sitting time. Lin believed that this violated the dance hall rules and was related to his own reputation, so he negotiated with the dance girl class leader Lou Minwei. Unexpectedly, Lou protected Shen and the other dance guest, causing a conflict. Xue Linlin, without asking the reason, took an iron rod and, together with Shao Amao, etc., violently attacked Lin and the others, causing Chen Yunlai to die and the others to be injured. Currently, the police are still conducting a thorough investigation of the case. Once the investigation is complete, the matter will be dealt with.</p>

<h3>The Strong Prevail Over the Real: The Bond Market Advances Unabated</h3>
<p>The over-the-counter market for public bonds continued to rise yesterday, showing strong momentum. The trend, from beginning to end, only advanced and never retreated, demonstrating even better conditions. The influx of buyers was strong and energetic, which was unexpected given the current environment and large-scale selling by major players. The financial community's focus on buying without selling was not solely due to loose monetary policy. Since April, the amount of circulating capital has invisibly increased by sixty to seventy million, and the buyers have not shrunk back despite the large supply of capital. This phenomenon is not just ordinary buying and selling; there must be a special outlet. Among the five types of public bonds, Class C bonds are in the highest demand, so their market price is also particularly high. The opening market price was one yuan to one yuan several jiao higher. The firmness of the market continued unabated, further highlighting the failure of the "real goods" faction to defeat the "strong" faction. As it gradually approaches the decisive stage, we shall observe what follows. Yesterday, Lianhe led the buying, followed by Shuntai Defu Yuanhe Wenkang. Others, including Yitai Hongxing Dazhong Qianyi Hengxing Yongkang Tongshun, as well as scattered retail investors, were all buying in succession. If it weren't for Tongli's outflow, wouldn't the market price have reached its peak? In addition to Tongli, Jiufeng Yiji's capital outflow was also significant yesterday. Others, such as Hu Heji Tongyuan Xinjie Hongda Yongkang, also had sellers. The trend did not appear to have even a small correction. As a result, the market prices of all bonds rose again by one yuan and five jiao to two yuan and eight jiao, with a total transaction volume of over five million yuan. A concise table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>---|---|---|---|---</p>
<p>Unified A | 35.20 | 34.00 | 34.80 | Up 1.50</p>

<p>Unified C | 34.50 | 32.80 | 34.10 | Up 2.10</p>
<p>Unified D | 32.00 | 29.80 | 21.70 | Up 2.70</p>

<h3>Talk of Control Rises Again, Cotton Yarn Falls Sharply, Shuangma Factory Enters the 5,000 Yuan Threshold Individually</h3>

<p>The factory cloth market was sluggish yesterday, because actual sales were stagnant, so many floating orders continued to be released. 16-pound Diqiu coarse cloth was at 190 yuan, Feihong at 185 yuan, each falling 10 yuan per bolt. 12-pound Diqiu fine cloth was at 165 yuan, Dapeng at 160 yuan, Fugui at 155 yuan, a drop of 7 to 8 yuan.

<p>Yesterday, the spot gold market began in darkness, with a sudden and drastic drop in prices. The price had retreated to the 20,000 yuan threshold, and the morale of all parties suddenly turned weak. After the news of control in the cotton yarn market spread, the bulls panicked and sold off, and there was also a large amount of selling from the Tianjin gang. The opening price in the morning for each piece (ten taels) was 21,200 yuan, the same as the closing price of the previous day. A certain firm acted as an agent for the financial community with very good gains, and three securities firms acting as agents for the Tianjin gang repeatedly sold off. Rumors of interest gains suddenly arose, and silver firms and spot gold firms sold and sold, and the market price plummeted by 1,600 yuan in a state of supply exceeding demand, breaking into the 20,000 yuan mark, reaching a low of 19,600 yuan. Another securities firm and a certain gang and spot gold firms re-entered, raising it to 20,150 yuan, and finally the Tianjin gang was seen selling off.

<h3>Qielike Cigarettes: 110 Yuan per Can</h3>
<p>The selling price of upper-class cigarettes of various brands has been rising endlessly. Because the factory does not produce them, the stock is running out day by day. Those who hold the goods are hoarding them for speculation, and the market price is skyrocketing. For example, 50-stick Qielike has been sold for 110 yuan per can, which shows how high the price is. The price of 50-stick packages of 10,000 sticks is recorded below: Da Nanwei 20,000 yuan, Qielike 22,000 yuan, Three-Five Brand 19,500 yuan, Da Paotai 12,500 yuan, Xiao Paotai 9,600 yuan, Da Qianmen 21,700 yuan, Ten-stick Da Qianmen 3,700 yuan, Da Paotai 8,700 yuan, Xiao Paotai 4,800 yuan, 110-stick package Da Nanwei 265 yuan, Da Qian Dou 75 yuan, Shiguan Brand 60 yuan, Lao Han Brand 160 yuan, Zeng Lingpai 78 yuan.

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>How to Suppress Prices</h3>
<p>— Fluctuations</p>
<p>Because of the change in the currency system, the market is really alarmed several times a day. What is called "different market prices in the morning and evening" is now really being fulfilled.</p>
<p>According to regulations, the ratio of Central Reserve Bank notes to the old legal tender is two to one, but except for movie theaters or theaters, which are truly and realistically halved, which thing is not increased by several percent? Some simply add the "new legal tender" stamp to the original price.</p>
<p>The owner of a department store told me that his capital was 500,000 yuan. After the change of the currency system, his capital was reduced to 250,000 yuan. If the goods in the store are still priced at a ratio of two to one, wouldn't he lose 250,000 yuan? Therefore, secretly raising prices after nominally lowering them is indeed a last resort. At first, I nodded and sympathized with his statement, and then I thought that his store has been open for at least four years. In these four years, it is inevitable that he has only made money and not lost money, and his capital has already become commodities. Even if there is some circulating capital in hand or deposited in the bank, how can the loss in the currency system compare to the surplus in the goods?</p>
<p>The facts are in front of us, and all the reasons are superfluous. Now it is only the poor who get poorer and the rich who get richer. Let me give another example. An old man who lives on interest from savings said with tears in his eyes: My savings are getting less and less, but the cost of living has risen 30 to 50 times! Can you say that this is not a fact?</p>
<p>Now is still the time of transition between the old and new currencies. When the old legal tender is completely discontinued, I think there will be greater changes in the market. Therefore, how to suppress prices is at a final juncture.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on the Closure of School-Shops</h3>
<p>— Kuangcheng</p>
<p>Recently, a disturbance occurred in a primary school in the French Concession. Although the reasons are complex, the profit-seeking owners of school-shops cannot help but feel a sense of shared misfortune. Today, it seems impossible to have both education and business acumen.</p>
<p>In recent years, the owners of school-shops have been quite prominent. Having a small alley school in hand is not a problem for making money. A principal who knows how to plan can make a lot of money!</p>
<p>Life is changing, and prices are constantly rising. At the same time, we still have to ration rice and coal... Students are not only unable to afford to study, but also have no time to study: and many people have returned to their hometowns. The number of students this semester has decreased by one-third, and the situation in the next semester is even more unimaginable. Most people think that it is fortunate to fill their stomachs, and put schooling behind them. This makes the owners of school-shops feel uneasy.</p>
<p>On the teacher's side, the salary is still more than 100 yuan today, calculated on the basis of ten months per semester. Unless chalk dust can satisfy hunger, they have hope of living. The teachers have left the life of teaching and changed careers, and the rest are just muddling through one day at a time. At the end of the month, they routinely make a request to the principal for a salary increase, and then the inability to hire good teachers has become a difficult problem for the principals.</p>
<p>In some schools, although the principals are shrewd and try their best to save expenses, and even dismiss the school servants, and the miscellaneous tasks are done by the teachers and students, the income is greatly reduced, and there is no perfect solution.</p>
<p>A friend of mine, Mr. Someone, is a thorough educational businessman. A few years ago, he rented a shikumen house and opened a small alley school. There are only two classrooms, and the third floor is rented out at a good price. There are only two teachers, and all the school affairs are entrusted to a loyal and reliable</p>
<p>Life Report</p>
<h3>Checking and Disinfecting Milk</h3>
<p>— Only</p>
<p>I am a small employee of a milk company. Before dawn, it is time for me to get up and distribute milk. The milk deliverers from all districts are waiting for me with bicycles. Counting the bottles is the most cumbersome thing, because the number is large and it is easy to overlook and count wrong. If it is less, the milk deliverer will come to you to ask for it; but if it is more, they will not say anything and just let it pass. So the one who suffers when settling the account is me. After distributing the milk, another day's work is to go to the air-conditioned room to count the amount of milk in stock. The temperature in the air-conditioned room is more than 30 degrees Celsius, which is a very uncomfortable cold temperature. If you wear less clothes, you will easily catch a cold, especially in hot weather. After staying in the air-conditioned room for half an hour, you can rest and sleep. Around 8 o'clock, it is time for the milk deliverers to come back. They will report which households have stopped delivering and which have added deliveries. Sometimes the municipal bureau draws a bottle of milk from the milk deliverers and takes it to the health department for testing. A few days later, a report is given to us. If the bacteria exceeds the predetermined number, we will be warned. If the boss is warned, he will blame us for not paying attention to the burning of milk. How can we pay attention to it? Milk is steamed with steam to 145 degrees to kill the germs. This is the principle of disinfection. The disinfected milk is cooled by the air-conditioned mess plate, and then put into the bottling machine, and then bottling starts. These bottles also have to go through several procedures first. Bottling is very fast under the skilled technicians. After a semi-mechanical continuous project, two or three thousand bottles can be completed. After my checking. The key to the air-conditioned room is my talisman, and it must always be on my body, and the responsibility for loss is great. Because the locks are very special and not easy to match. After that, the remaining time is to make the milk room report and the production table. With the rising prices, milk has also undergone several price increases. But Shanghai seems to be a place without poor people. With the constant ringing of the phone, the number of drinkers is increasing by sixty to seventy households a day, which makes us speechless.</p>
<h3>Good Deeds</h3>
<p>— Xie</p>
<p>Buying at high prices and selling at flat prices.</p>
<p>The Dean of Academic Affairs, he himself is working hard all day long on hoarding, because using the school to hoard paper and stationery is both convenient and easy to get cheap.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this semester, the profit was reduced by half, and there was no prospect of running a school. This boss, who knows how to plan, made up his mind that he could close the school after the summer vacation. Fortunately, there is a house, and being a second landlord will not be bad.</p>
<p>Recently, he has been completely disappointed. The second landlord is now plummeting. If he collects tips, he will be sued, and overcharging rent is also a long way off.</p>
<p>After calculating and calculating, he felt that if this primary school was to continue, unless the tuition fee was doubled, even if there were fewer students, there would be a surplus. In fact, the tuition fee had already risen to an unbearable level, and doubling it would simply be unpopular. So he changed his mind and transferred the school to make money and do other business.</p>
<p>The school-shop owners can no longer make their wishful thinking. They lack the spirit of running education on weekdays, and now they have suffered this blow, so they simply quit. Many schools announced their closure at the end of this semester, and mostly ignored the problem of students dropping out of school.</p>
<p>Although we don't have to gloat, this kind of commercialized school closure is not a loss to society. What is a pity is that at the same time, the public is concerned about the unemployment of teachers and the loss of schooling of students.</p>
<h3>Riding the Storm Together</h3>
<p>— Hejia Branch</p>
<p>(5) Coming and Going</p>
<p>Mrs. Cai Er said: "This was made for her by your mother. It is a deep blue silk fabric. She couldn't bear to wear it, so she kept it in our house. I said she wanted to go to Shanghai, maybe half of it was because she had this dress." Wei Cheng's face showed some smiles again. Mrs. Ye Er had a younger sister who was not married and was sick at home. Mrs. Ye Er had been busy with Mrs. Ye Da's funeral all this time, and had not gone back to see her once; now that she was free, she wanted to see her. Wei Cheng said: "Aunt, go back and see Second Aunt. There is nothing at home, and if there is anything, I can deal with it." In a few days, it will not rain, and there will be things to do in the fields when it rains. Take the small boat from your own home, and Hezi will row the boat. Aunt does not have to rush back. It doesn't matter if you stay at Uncle Zhang's house for two or three days. Mrs. Ye Er said: "Then I will go. Wei Cheng, you stay at home and read books. If you feel bored, walk around in the yard, or else, in the open space outside. Don't go out." Wei Cheng said: "I know everything." Although Mrs. Ye Er left, she still told Magpie, told Mother He, and told Ah Xing, all of them to be careful about the young master's affairs: and then let He Zixing row the boat and go back to her mother's house ten miles away.</p>
<p>Wei Cheng stood foolishly in front of the portraits of his parents, standing for less than a minute, when Magpie said behind him, "The Second Mrs. told the young master to read books, young master, read your books." Wei Cheng said: "You don't care about my affairs." He walked to the room where Guofang and Cuizhen lived every other night, and saw that the bottle of Xuehua flower cream was open, and the bottle cap was thrown far away on the window. He picked up the bottle of Xuehua flower cream and smelled it, and his heart swayed. Magpie said again behind him: "The Second Mrs. told the young master to walk around in the big fight, how did the young master come here?" Wei Cheng said: "You want to take care of my affairs again. You don't come to clean up the cosmetics that the young ladies have used."</p>
<p>The next day, Wei Cheng was planning how to improve the spring ploughing method this year by himself, and drew a picture of all the fields in his home. There is the river channel, there are trees, that piece is open space, and that piece is wheat field. The wheat field is painted with wheat, and the open space is left blank. After drawing for a while, he wanted to smoke a cigarette, and put a cigarette in his hand. Ah Yu suddenly chuckled and struck a match to light it for him. Wei Cheng said: "You are in the house, I don't know." Ah Xing smiled and said: "Young Master, what are you drawing? Last time when the Old Mrs. was alive, there were many painting axes hung in the house, green and red, why is the Young Master drawing only with a pencil some lines?" Wei Cheng took a puff of cigarette and said, "You don't understand, I'm not drawing, I'm drawing the fields at home. It's even better that you are here, how many acres is this in front of the old cemetery?" (94)</p>
<h3>Leisure and Busyness</h3>
<p>— Chenjing</p>
<p>There are many relative words in the vocabulary, such as: "right and wrong", "black and white", "rich and poor"... and so on.</p>
<p>But sometimes suddenly "right and wrong" are unclear, and "black and white" are confused, so mankind also has the division of "rich" and "poor". Because of this, a pair of different words are also produced: "leisure" and "busyness". Some people rely on their power and wealth to live a leisurely life all day long; others are ruthlessly whipped by poverty and cold, forcing them to work hard day and night without stopping.</p>
<p>Today, the so-called "leisure" and "busyness" seem to have changed somewhat. On the one hand, the "leisure" are indeed more idle, so bored that they listen to operas and play with women all day and night, and the "busy" are even busier, with no chance to rest even at night, holding the quilt corner and guarding the rice shop door in fear; but on the other hand, the "leisure" are extremely quiet and think about action. In addition to drawing and playing chess, they are attracted by the market fluctuations and become red-eyed, so buying and selling injuries add a lot of unfamiliar people to the market, so the "leisure" friends start to be "busy". This "busyness" helps prices to "ascend to heaven", and the word "see rise" spreads thousands of miles. The factory owner puts down the manufactured products and does not let them go, and watches the market change again; there is no need to worry about raw materials, let them pile up like mountains, and the machine "suddenly breaks down, it is better to start work again after the repair is completed"? So the "busy" friends who have been benefiting others day and night now have to be idle.</p>
<p>"Leisure" and "busyness" were originally "created" by mankind, and of course their elimination still depends on mankind. The most effective way to reduce them is to try to wipe away all relative words in the dictionary.</p>
<h3>About Getting Up Early</h3>
<p>— Naisheng Recorded</p>
<p>Those who are still sleeping when it is dawn are not great men. - Switte</p>
<p>Being able to get up one or two hours early every day can strengthen the body; the first teaching of health experts is to be able to get up early. - Weisen Cobley</p>
<p>A sleepy person is enough to weaken a person's physique. - John Joe</p>
<p>Getting up early can refresh the mind. - Tairs</p>
<p>If we can be diligent when getting up early, we can achieve twice the result with half the effort. - Hong Chuanhua</p>
<p>If you want to seek my longevity, it is better to save sleep. - Peter</p>
<p>(But in the proverbs of various countries in the world, there is still no saying "spiritual morning dance".)</p>
<p>(Instead of rewarding)</p>
<h3>Be Careful When Shopping</h3>
<p>— Wang Zhicheng</p>
<p>Coming to Shanghai, the goods are expensive and speculation is good. In addition to hoarding and speculating, they are also mixing fish eyes with pearls to deceive customers, which is hateful. A friend of mine has been cheated on shopping more than once. At first, he bought kerosene but it was cold water, he bought Wan Jin Oil but it was petroleum jelly, and he bought Bagua Dan but it was a piece of plywood; what is even more hateful is that he once went to a certain egg shop to buy four raw salted eggs, and the price was very cheap, only four jiao per egg, and when he got home, he washed and cooked them, and he was shocked that they were not salted eggs at all. It was an egg shell that others had discarded, the two pieces were put together, and yellow mud was firmly stuffed inside, and yellow mud was also painted on the outside of the shell, which looked like a salted egg. He wasted 1.6 yuan in vain, and he had to admit that he was unlucky.</p>
<p>(Editor's note: It is true that you should be careful when buying goods, but if you are also "buying" and "hoarding", it is better to hate your own conscience.)</p>
<h3>Addendum</h3>
<p>— Xie</p>
<p>On the 2nd, Mr. SK introduced three economic barbershops in this journal, which is really good news for small employees in this difficult time. According to what I know, I still feel that there is one place that is missing, so I specially added it.</p>
<p>The barbershop in the Shanghai Insurance Industry Association on the fourth floor of 160 Edward Road (Thames Building) sells membership haircut coupons, five yuan for five tickets, and five yuan for four tickets for non-members. For each haircut, give one ticket, which is actually cheaper than what Mr. SK described. To Mr. Cao Dan:</p>
<p>The three barbershops introduced by Mr. SK are all calculated in the old legal tender. It is not known whether they will be changed or increased in price later. This is a reply. Editorial Department</p>
<h3>Microscope and Telescope</h3>
<p>— Wang Sheng</p>
<p>A friend of mine studies biology. He is used to using a microscope in the laboratory. Therefore, he observes everything in a "microscopic" manner.</p>
<p>In the past, he would often proudly tell me that nothing could hide its ugliness under a microscope. Look, those terrible microorganisms are evil demons that harm people.</p>
<p>However, recently he no longer smiles. The reason is that under his narrow microscopic observation, there is only ugliness, despair, and not a trace of hope for life. He was so angry that he almost threw away the microscope.</p>
<p>"Be reasonable," I sincerely advised him, "Everything under the microscope is indeed a fact, but it is not enough to observe with a microscope alone. Under its narrow lens, you can only see partial, one-sided reality. Pick up the microscope, and at the same time pick up the telescope, look back and then look forward into the distance. Then, so-called 'ugliness' and 'despair' are only temporary and partial phenomena. There is hope for life in the distance.”</p>
<p>But he still doesn't understand, "Reality is clearly ugly and desperate. Although there is a glimmer of hope for life in the distance, what is the path to reach life?"</p>
<p>I advised him to use the method of "X-ray" perspective to observe all the ugliness presented under the microscope, to discover the essence of the facts, and it would not be difficult to obtain the source of the ugliness and the method of eradicating it. In this way, everything would be clear, and our vision would no longer be blinded by the phenomenon.</p>
<p>So, this friend left his laboratory, picked up the microscope and telescope, and also grasped the method of perspective. Soon, I saw his smile again.</p>
