<p>社評</p>
<h3>談物價問題</h3>
<p>物價問題，在上海雖然不是一個新發生的問題，可是，幾年來是一天嚴重一天地威脅着上海數百萬市民的生活。這個問題如果沒有妥善萬全的對策。影響於全上海市民之生活自不待說，甚至對於整個和平區，都不能不發生嚴重的後果呢。最近報載中日商會合組經濟委員會，謀協力於物價的新對策，這是很　得市民重視的。我們敬敢貢獻如下幾點意見；</p>
<p>首先，我們必須認淸物價問題的癥結，才能謀得根本的解決辦法；否則，就會和過去的努力一樣，不免「事倍功半」。實際觀察，物價問題的發生，（一）由於通貨之某種程度的膨脹；（二）由於囤積居奇；（三）由於生產沉滯；及（四）由於戰後物姿需要程度的增加，形成了物資某程程度的缺乏。此外，交通遝輸之停滯，自　多少也直接問接使物價問題嚴重起來，但最主要的癥結是在於前述四大原因。因爲，通貨發行的增加，如果不設法使其「回籠，」或不設法導入生　事業，則那些增發的籌碼，便會促使物價的上漲。何況那些握有游姿的人們，還拼命的尋覓一切機會去從事投機，去囤積居奇，越囤積，物價越漲，物價越漲，政府與各機關開支越大，因而通貨的發行亦就不斷的增加。另一方面，由於游姿的迫脅，由於投機和囤積的暴利之誘惑，更由於其他環境上的原因，生產日益沉滯，而各方面消耗物資的程度卻日益增加了，這樣，物資形成了缺乏，表顯出供求之間存在巨大的距離，這樣又促進了物價的高漲與投機囤積的活動。我們如果要澈底解決物價問題，便必須把握住上述四大相互影響的根本原因，從這裏着手，這就是；必須緊縮通貨，必須嚴禁囤積，必須發展生產，必須節約消耗，必須增加物資。</p>
<p>第一，在緊縮通貨方面，固然希望減少發行數量。同時政府方面，必須實行節的，避免任何浪費，必須裁併駢枝機關，嚴懲舞弊營私和貪污奢靡的行爲。積　的使已發行的通貨和民間的游資，都投入國民生活安定所必需的生產事業。第二，在禁絕囤積居奇方面，必須切實調查，而允當注意者，不能專靠情報與吿密，因為這些只能乍萬一的參考。至於調查登記的手續，必須簡單，登記的時間不妨延長。對於金融，應嚴禁少數銀行錢莊之暗辦商行，進行囤貨。而對於囤戶，應從大處着手，高處取締，懲一儆百，切不可只注視小囤戶，忽視大囤虎，更不可爲了面子，明白放縱大囤虎，給人民以不良印象。第三，在增加生產方面，必須盡量扶助民營工業，尤其是扶助小規模生產事業，不但要取消一切不合理的極梏，而且應當積極的給予援助。在原料的收集方面，在資金的調劑方面，在生產品的運輸方面，以及在捐稅方面，對於民間工業務須由中日雙方當局多多給予便利。第四，在物資協力方面，爲供應大東亞戰爭之需要，人民方面必須切實忍受苦痛；不過當局應有統一的合理的辦法，而允應盡一切可能，以求減少人民尤其是中小工商業者的不便與苦痛。</p>
<p>此外，最重要的，就是在物資和物價的統制或管理方面，必須注意下列幾點；第一，執行的機構必須統一，庶免工商界有「無所適從」之苦，而且又可增加工作效率。共次是對於工商各業，必須處處採用扶助的態度，不能單憑原則，單靠命令，更須避免輕率處罰，使生產者無所措其手足。第三，統制和管理的手續必須力求簡單，要迅速，要靈敏，因爲主管機關一秒鐘的宕擱，工商各業就會遭受莫大的損失了。最後，關於統制和管理的人員，允必須極度愼重選任，因爲「有治法而無治人」，就把優良的辦法都弄糟了。</p>
<p>我們要鄭重向當局呼籲的是；物價問題是當前一大問題，決小是一紙命令，一個原則和一二機構所能解決的，必須從根本着手，同時必須取得人民的協力。</p>

<h3>最近歐洲新陣容　十二月二十二日東京日日新聞社論</h3>
<p>十九日，在德國大本營舉行了德，義，法三國代表的會見。繼之，二十日，在里斯本，又發表了西班牙和葡萄牙之間業已結成伊伯利惡聯續的消息。</p>
<p>這兩件事，意義都非常重大。關於前者，會談的結果雖未發表，但法國一定成為議題的中心，其會談的內容，也不雖推想而知。自美英侵入北非後，法國的國際地位，俄然進入了微妙狀態，因此，維希政府就有重新明確地表示對軸心國協力之必要。事實上，貝當和賴伐商先後都宣言了全面的對軸協力。關於全面協力之事，得有進一步的商談，是不待言的。希特勒主持下的十九的會談，大概就是這商談的會見吧。</p>
<p>伊伯利亞聯繫之結成，就其意義而言，有着不下於法國問題的重要性。就地理關係上說，伊伯利亞半島在這决大戰中，是關係頗大的。所以，由於美英對北非的進攻，牠一舉就置身於大戰的中心了。牠正像劇風中的一葉飄蓬。就牛島自身而言，置身於這樣的狀祝，也包含着極大的危險。他的一舉手一投足，在在都能給交戰諸國以極大的影響。現在，美英侵入軍在突尼西亞綫上不但拖滯住了，而且，由於軸心軍的反攻，反倒向後倒退起來。美英二國，爲求達成其侵略目的，原本是不擇手段的。今茲北非方面的遠征軍走上了死活的歧路，他們將怎樣去做，都是不得而知的。</p>
<p>在伊伯利亞半島之西，西葡兩國，直立於此危機之前，成立了堅強的　繫；這不僅對於兩國自身，就是對於整個戰局前途，也是一件值得慶賀的事。（牧譯）</p>

<p>各代表演講</p>
<p>滿洲國經濟部大臣阮振鐸氏</p>
<p>滿洲國經濟部大臣阮振鐸氏回顧滿洲國建設十年的歷史，建國當初的五年，傾全力於基本諸事項的整備，自康德四年（昭和十二年）起，希圖在此基盤上增強國防生產力，並確立自給自足體制，遂一開始了第一次產業開發五年計劃。嗣後不久，鑒於中國事變之勃發，計劃之飛躍的擴大強化，就成爲必要了。</p>
<p>隨後，第二次世界大戰，德蘇開戰，大東亞戰爭相繼而起，造成了幾多困難的事態。但是，由於日滿一德一心的協力精神，將這些困難逐一克服，完成了下面那樣的成果：</p>
<p>第一次五年計劃各部門的主要成果，若以康德三年（昭和十一年）度爲一〇〇，則康德八年（昭和十六）度的實績：</p>
<p>在農業部門：高粱一一六％，粟一一五％，包米一四八％，水稻三三〇％，燕麥三八三％，棉花一五六％，洋麻二三二％，亞麻五四六％，野蠶一二九％，烟草一·〇八三％，甜菜四五六％。</p>
<p>在商產部門：馬一〇五％，牛一二〇％，豬一〇九％，綿羊一二五％，羊毛一三〇％</p>
<p>在鑛工業部分：銑鐵二一九％，鋼塊一五四，鋼材二六四％，煤一七八％，鉛一。二二三％，亞鉛三九八％，銅五一七％，石棉四·八二八％，流安一〇四％，鹽一五〇％，曹達灰五四五％，炭酸曹達三·五〇〇％，鉛一·六六六％，軟漿Pulp（由軟麻布棉布或樹皮等化成者!譯者註）七九〇％，液體燃料一六〇％。</p>
<p>在總的方面說，比起計對實施前的成續來，不可否認地，有了飛躍的成果。</p>
<p>迎着本年建國十周年，在新情勢下，滿洲國正在企圖樹立並實行第二次經濟建設計劃。作爲其根本方針，我們想以東亞共榮圈內自給經濟之急速確立爲目標，充分完成建設並開發適合於滿洲國姿源的基本諸產業之重大的使命，並圖開發及促進現地必須確立的諸產業。同時，鑒於第一次經濟建設之成果，希望能爲產業諸分野之均衛的育成發展而努力，俾使綜合的經濟國力得以充實和增強。</p>
<p>根據上面的根本方針，計劃產業的範圍大致如次：</p>
<p>第一，作爲適合於滿洲的有利的基本資源產業，而對自給圈經濟之確立有極大貢獻的許多東西，即如農產物，鐵鋼，水力發電，煤，輕金屬，鹽，有機合成化學藥品等。就中，特別要把重點放在鐵鋼及農產物上面。</p>
<p>第二，作爲前綫基地，而於現地有保有之必要的許多產業。爲求增強此等計劃產業計，以綜合經濟國力之充實，補強爲目的的生活必須品產業及輕工業等之育成保持，也爲不可忽視之要務，在執行上述任務時，一方面利用並動員現存設備，同時還須節的新規機材，盡可能地圖之於地方資源及土著資本之活用。</p>
<p>除以上約計劃外，我國正在實施的戰時緊急經濟對策，的有下面數端：</p>
<p>第一，增強日本方面戰時緊要物姿之生產，以圖對日供給之增大。</p>
<p>第二，竭力節的緊要物資之消費，澈底勵行該項物資之代用品之使用，以期對戰爭資源力之充實有所貢獻。在生產必需物資方面，必須竭力抑制對日本的期待，以期國內自給力之向上。同時，配給消費的容量，更須加倍地強化。</p>
<p>第三，對經濟體制的一律統制方式之採用，加以愼重反省，和生產配給消贊價格等各方面之統制相關聯，對現行制度施以全面的調整，以期制度及其運用之完全合理化。</p>
<p>第四，鑒於金融通貨之安定，爲經濟持久戰遂行上絕對的基礎條件，一方面樹立處置一切專態的確固的方法，同時，為求增強貯蓄計，必須展開協和會運動，國民儲蓄運動，藉「增新稅」及其他方策，以推進購買力之吸收。又爲防止惡性通貨膨脹計，一方面進行配給機構之整備再編，以及配給之適正化，同時還須創立經濟平衡資金制度，對戰時物價政策之遂行，給予最大的注意。</p>

<h3>戰事影響　南美工業　原料無法輸出　機器無法輸入</h3>
<p>里斯本廿八日哈瓦斯社電據拉丁美洲各國京城傳來消息、歐戰爆發以來、拉丁美洲各國與歐洲交通斷絕、工業因而發生種種困難、阿根廷與巴西兩國公用事業、尤感不便、蓋各該國各種專業、均採用歐洲通行之標準度量米突制、但南美各商行現不復能獲得必需之零件、而美國工業則採取英國制度、又不能以必要設備、供給南美、解决此一困難、費數年之久、自美國參戰後、情形稍稍改善、但自協約國缺乏船隻、及潛艇戰爭擴大及於整個大西祥後、價形又轉趨惡劣、南美各國現遭受原料無法輸出之痛苦、因而巴西國內、咖啡存貨、堆積如山、而美國境內對於咖啡、則實行限制購買辦法、此在拉丁美洲各國向自美國輸入製造品、允以必需之工業機器爲主、例如美國運往巴西之農具、顯已減少、據巴西京城消息、去年爲三千六百噸、今年已減至三百八十噸云、</p>

<h3>一年來北婆羅洲　交通經濟概況</h3>
<p>古晉二十九日中央社電　婆羅洲自經日軍　平以後、已於大東亞建設上負起重要任務，前途實有無限希望、茲將一年來北婆羅洲經濟建設狀況介紹餘下、</p>
<p>交通</p>
<p>婆羅洲整個交通、除舟運之外、殆無何可言、且因受海岸綫遠淺影響、各河口水量甚淺、較大船舶之航行殆不可能、戰前會有五百萬噸之船舶行沿岸航路、自戰事發生後、沿岸航運即吿斷絕、茲經日電當局之努力、已有二百萬噸船舶恢復航運、至於道路亦頗稀少、現正計劃改修或建築、自哲塞爾敦至三山打根間、及婆羅乃至米里等道路、此外又鑒於山打根地位重要、故正計劃使該港更臻完善、現二萬噸級之船舶已可自　靠岸、預料該港今後將成爲北婆洲之中心墓地、</p>
<p>農業</p>
<p>北婆難洲所產果實頗爲豐富其中如婆羅密以味美聞名世界、戰前暢銷全球各地、今後擬在常地設置罐頭工廠、以資振興、其他如玉蜀黍、胡椒輿農作物等、因海岸地帶不週於據植，故將在內地處置密林後、再行種植、當局以此舉既可採伐原始林、且可增加生產、故極力獎勵、至於橡皮之栽培、現陷於停止狀況、良以橡皮一如菲島砂搪、同爲東亞匯內生產過剩品、</p>
<p>地下資源</p>
<p>北婆羅洲重要姿源最豐富者首推石油、其前途頗爲有望、現在之產量、已與戰前相埒、他如鐵·煤·金·攀礦水銀等礦產、亦極豐富、允以水銀之出產最爲豐富、有世界第一之稱、月可產若干噸、至煤之開發、以供給南方當地需要爲目的、婆羅洲之礦物資源、現雖尚未調查、惟其埋藏量定極豐富、前途誠未可限量云、</p>

<h3>內地士兵的生活</h3>
<p>在十月裏，桂林大公報發表了一篇「如何酬答前方將士」的社評，引起了士兵們的不平和憤懣，且看下面兩個實例：</p>
<p>其一</p>
<p>我有一件隱伏在腦海裏久欲言而未吐露的衷情。看到大公報社評「如何酬答前方將士」一文，不期把我的衷情揭曉，當時甚感愉快，我謹以六百萬戰士一份子的姿格，致最誠懇的感謝。</p>
<p>我是在湘省高中學校裏續過書的一位學生靑年，自戰事爆發後，即自動的拋棄學校的生活，加入了戰地服務工作，未幾；即投入×部隊服務。從此正式過着軍人的生活。我們軍隊的待遇，因國家經濟不寬裕，這次戰事木是很艱苦的；所以當然趕不上歐美諸國。近兩年來，因爲物價飛漲，軍人的生活的確太苦了。</p>
<p>這幾年，「軍事第一，勝利第一的呼聲，遍及全國每個角落，在此長期作戰期間，照道理說，國家應該把一切力量財富　可能都用在軍事方面來。以目前戰士的待遇，在送國家財政困難的今日，我們千百萬伙伴戰士們的穿及日常用品等，自然沒有什麼奢望：單就生活一項來說，現在一般部隊戰士們的伙食，主食費（軍米）每人一天市秤二十四兩，副食費每月十三元，平均每人得四角三分一天。在這物價昂貴的今日，試問：每人四角三分，除掉買柴火以外，尙餘幾許？即以米一項講。每天市秤二十四兩，（連麻包及搬運損失在內）燒成飯只有三碗多點，在平時及富豪者的人是頂夠了的，可是戰士們，不是整天伏在戰壕裏打仗，就是操作，試問每日祇靠這兩頓六碗，如何能談得上營養？</p>
<p>其二</p>
<p>我是××部隊的一個士兵，因爲見到大公報社評：「如何酬答前方將士，」所評述的一切，全是事實，實在感動我的心靈，完全是我心中所要講的話，誠然，公務員之呼籲，學校教師之呼籲，均有人爲之，而獨我們軍人的生活情形，還很少有人關切着，過去的事，我們不提了，同時，祇希望我們能維持最低限度的生活。現在，我們每月十餘元的待遇，實在太苦了！吃飯談不到菜蔬，下飯之物，一小飯碗白菜開水而已。</p>

<h3>船舶戰爭　對談</h3>
<p>海軍造船中將　永村清</p>
<p>前東京高等商　船學校校長　須川邦彥</p>
<p>朝日週刋記者</p>
<p>譯自十二月二十七日朝日週刋　（完續）</p>
<p>日本的船是日本的寶</p>
<p>須川：日本的商船，是世界第一，這話我以爲是可以堂堂皇皇來說的。有着這樣的例子在這裏。好久以前，大阪商船會社有叫做〇〇丸的，是一艘一萬噸級的優秀客船。那艘審船和國際汽船會社叫做〇〇丸的一萬噸級的屬秀貨船，不幸在太平洋當中相撞了。〇〇丸的船頭攎在客船的橫腹上，把引擎室撞成一個大洞，水就衝進去了，然而引擎室裏雖然充滿了水，別的部分則一滴的水也沒有侵入。從這個事實看來，就可知道把船造得怎麼樣的堅密而不漏水了。至於〇〇丸則只有船頭撞凹，沒有大的損傷。當時就在太平洋當中放下救生艇，把船客從客船裏全部運到貨船上，貨船則更把客船拖到日本，這樣便得救了。</p>
<p>永村：老兄！這不只是造船方面的光榮哩，船員的質也值得稱贊的吧！</p>
<p>須川：不錯，若是外船，說不定就把客船放棄了吧。唯有日本的船員，會把這船當作日本的寶貝不肯讓它沉沒，所以把它拖回來了。那時在拖的一方，固然是不容易得很，而在被拖的一方，也是不容得很呢！因爲由一萬噸的船來拖一萬噸的船，萬一氣候惡劣，作起暴風來，那時便怎麼辦呢，其命運不是可想而知了。然而那時不管是工役，是水手，是廚子，是火夫，大家一齊，同心協力，擔當這個艱難的工作。在外國雖然也有這樣例子，然而在不知來日如何的船上，幾天又幾天的過去，大家弄得神經衰弱，以至自暴自棄，發生互相殘殺等變故，這樣例子，倒是多得不　枚舉哩。可是日本的船，則能一絲不亂地始終同心合力，一直回到日本來，在這裏我以爲就可證明日本海員的優秀和船體建造得怎樣堅傘了。</p>
<p>船舶戰爭已成爲常識的話了。而船只要拚命去造，在較短的時間裏，是可以造成的，不過要船走動，非有多數的船員不可。那些船員如其不是個個具有堅毅的精神，便不能切切實實去服務。所以船舶問題和船員問題，同成爲目下最重大的問題。我以爲在今日這樣局勢下，對於船問題，和海員的問題，尤其不能不根本的考慮。應付長期戰的方策是很多的，我則希望必須大家認識日本在長期戰中，船舶有着怎樣的作用，又須知道船是不能自己走動的，使船走動的是船員，把船員的堅強精神力移注於船，於是日本的船方始有偉大的作用。</p>
<p>對船員的感謝</p>
<p>記者：那麼代船員希望後方的國民應該怎楊呢？須川：我希望日本人應該更充分地去了解現在的戰爭是交通的戰爭。到了今日，大家已曉得運貨汽車無論在內地，在戰塲，都是非常有用的了。也曉得鐵路輸送是怎麼樣的重要了。所以這裏就來講船的輸送能力吧。拿可以裝載一萬噸貨物的商船，做例來說，像這樣的商船，倒不鉛怎麼樣的大船。而所謂一萬噸貨物，如用二噸載量的運貨汽車來裝，則沒有五千輛，便不能裝完。如用十噸載量的貨車，也需一千輛。如把貨車四十輛相接，編成一個列車，那麼就需要二十五列車，才能把一萬噸的貨物裝完。這就是船的力量。我把戰爭中船的作用，和一船人應召從軍各盡各的職務而貢獻其能力一樣看待。即無論客船或貨船，在平時都各就各的性能，爲社會服務，到了戰時，則應召入伍，如其爲優秀的客船，或是速力大的貨船，就成爲軍艦一樣，亦可當作軍艦來用。又雖屬漁船，也隨着軍隊的作戰，在敵前登陸等時，有種種用途。總之，無論什麼船，不問其大小，在戰爭裏都有用處。一般人以爲有用的船，必屬優秀船，那是不對的。無論什麼船都是有用的。</p>
<p>在上次歐洲戰爭時，橫行於大西洋及印度洋而有海上魔王之稱的德國盧克耐爾，其任艦長的船，就是一隻帆船。他在那隻帆船上裝了一架摩托，作爲補助機之用，會作了不少驚人的舉動。</p>
<p>所以我以爲國民必須確實認識，船是左右一國命運的東西。在戰爭裏，有着重大的任務；同時，也須對於船員，有正確的認識。所以，國民在每日三餐吃飯的時候，如其飯中混有洋米，就須知道洋米乃是船員拼着命從安南，從泰國，或從仰光，衝破敵人的游擊戰網而運來的。因之對於船的功勞，是不能不感謝的。否則，便恥爲海國的人民了。如其飯裏混有很多的洋米，那就是食糧豐富和船隻航行安全之微。可是船並非單運洋米而已，選載運着戰爭所必需一切資材，所以若洋米運入很多，尤應該歡喜。</p>
<p>使船員沒有後顧之憂</p>
<p>我希望國民都有那樣正確的認識，而對於海員更寄以十分的同情。進一步，還要考求怎樣保護和救濟的方法。德國和意大利都是如此的。此外像歐美各國，對於在海上服務了幾十年的人們，和在海上亡故者的子女及其遺族，也都有相當保護救濟的辦法。因此，船員在出海港時，常歡笑而去，沒有後顧之憂。我以爲那樣的辦法。實在是必要的。因爲這樣一來，有爲的靑少年們，便都肯出海爲國家去服務了。所以，無論是國家是國民，都須切切實實的去考求如何可使優秀的靑少年們爭着出海服務的方法。我相信這是對於長期戰爭，絕對必要</p>
<p>永村：這的確是重要的。</p>
<p>須川：我在日俄戰爭時，會讀過阿利育爾號主計兵布利博伊所寫的東西。他在投降後成爲俘虜，被移押於軍艦「朝日」上。據他寫着說：「從蔚山海面到舞鶴，那時非常喫驚。在「朝日」艦上，一到夜裏就可看見行着戰鬥操練俄國艦隊業已全部被滅，而日本還在行着戰門操練，由此乃得認識日本操勝的原因了？不禁爲之吐舌。」原來是那樣的氣概呀！</p>
<p>記者：謝謝。（立譯）</p>

<h3>同情心</h3>
<p>— 明月</p>
<p>在公共車輛上，有一個乘客對另一個乘客說，他昨晚在馬路上走，天氣很冷，看見一個乞丐，剝下將死未死乞丐的衣服，加在自己身上。那乘客很感慨地說：「窮透的人·神經大概已經麻木，連一點同情心都沒有了。」</p>
<p>我聽了這番話，一幕乞丐剝衣服的悲慘活劇，像活動影片似的在我腦子裏出現着。</p>
<p>是的，這幕活劇在「正人君子」們看來，不免要發一番牢騷，說：如果他們平日能省吃儉用，在銀行裏多儲蓄些款子，怎麼會淪落爲乞丐？這兩個乞丐，一定是自己不努力，不習上。活該！活該！</p>
<p>社會的情形很是複雜，尤其是在這空前未有的大動盪時代，淪爲乞丐的原因很多，經過的慘史，也非一言可盡。我們姑不去硏究。縈　在我腦子裏的問題是：「窮透的人，是不是一點同情心都沒有？</p>
<p>孟子說：「惻隱之心，人皆有之。」美國富蘭克林說：「窮人比富人爲慷慨。」</p>
<p>照我的猜測，那乞丐之剝將死未死乞丐的衣服，實在是一種極端的懦怯舉動。（誠然，這種舉動是可怕的。）因爲他剝路人的衣服是要吃官司的，剝將死未死乞丐的衣服，可不致受什麽干涉。這是人間地獄的慘史，與有無同情心恐無關係。</p>
<p>一般奸商和投機份子，囤積操縱，把物價抬釗三十三天，他們少數人的確成爲百萬千萬的富翁了。可是許多人本可不致淪做乞丐，郤爲高物價壓得透不過氣，淪爲乞丐了。少數暴富的人，盡聲色犬馬之奉，假如他們肯少剝削或少浪費百分之一或千分之一，就可救活不少的人；可是他們寗可千金買笑，萬金買歡，而絕不肯表示一點同情心。請問富人的同情心，究竟在哪兒呢？</p>
<p>「爲富」和「爲仁」絕不是芳鄰。少數聰明的富者，間或行些小仁小惠，那不過是「爲富」好名之一種手段。從純道德立塲來說，已有可議。但是，我們所盼望於富者，這一點已大不容易了！</p>
<h3>街頭小掌故補</h3>
<p>— 高秀夫</p>
<p>十二月二十八日訒盦君作陸遜墓址辯正，以正二十三日白虹君所撰街頭小掌故之訛。考據翔實，曷勝韋佩。復次，白虹君述及上海路名。以華人姓名名路者，除朱葆三路虞洽卿路外。僅有麟桂路。是誠然矣。據余所知。尚有一路爲華人之名而為人所忽者，即善鐘路。按有陶如增。名善鐘。浦左川沙縣屬之顧家路人。操調馬業。咸同年間，設馬車行。營業甚盛。廣置地產於該處。陶氏復熱心慈善，對本埠暨桑梓公益事宜，多所匡助。法租界公董局遂以其名名路。詳載川沙縣志云。</p>
<h3>舉辦平民小本貸款</h3>
<p>— 漢瑞</p>
<p>目前除了少數有錢的人外，大家都同感生活的不容易；好似生在愁城之中，大有過）一‘日算一日之勢。尤其是一般失業的平民，他們有的因公司店號停業而被解僱：有的在緊縮開支聲中被擠軋出來。他們沒有權勢，不能再找一個棲身的地方：他們沒有錢，更不能做買賣賺錢。在這種環境控制下，失業的平民是最痛苦的了。</p>
<p>我們對於這羣失業平民的痛苦，能無動於心嗎？不，我們應該本人類的「互助」精神，予他們以可能的幫助。希望社會上有錢的人來担任這一佳救濟失業平民亟切而有意義的工作。</p>
<p>敎濟失業平民的辦法有二種：一爲舉辦職業介紹所，一爲小本貸款；前者已有工部局工業社會處所屬職業介紹科舉辦之失業技工登記；後者以前有新聞報社會服務　的小本貸金，最近更有河南路如意里金源錢莊舉辦的平民小本貸款。</p>
<p>除了代爲介紹職業，我以爲最好的解決失業方法確是舉辦平民小木貸款，其意義可以有三：（一）很多的平民失了業，心灰意懶，思想　唐，在經濟壓迫下，不得已或積極的鋌而走險，或消極的自殺，對社會的治安很有影響。貸款是給他們一條希望的路，增强失業者的自信心。（二）平日我們路見形狀可憐的人，給他幾個錢，固是出於同情心，但可能使其自暴自棄，專靠旁人救濟，餋成倚賴的習慣。貸款能使一般平民自主自救，啟發他們自棞更生的觀念（三）失業平民如能將貸得之款，善加運用，賺點利益，可能解決一部或全部的家庭負担。</p>
<p>擄筆者所知，自金源錢莊登報舉辦小本貸金以來，申請頗稱踴躍，現已將首批調查完竣，不日即可發款。亟望全滬有錢人士奮起而追踵之，將範圍擴大，使許多失業平民街頭流浪者得免飢寒交迫之苦，而能有自食共力的機會。（酬充助學金）</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>一二　後庭花</p>
<p>維城住在碾廠裏，創口倒是平復了，直佳到元宵，給厲又榭夫人知道了。這就催維城回去。維城想着做人做到這個地步，簡直沒有個是處，除了回去閉門思過，再也沒有其他的適當辦法。他在一個月明之夜，由厲又榭派了一個人送維城回來。葉二太太又驚又喜，翠珍也是如此，問黃龍在什麽地方。維城道：「嬸娘，我在外邊，賽如做了一塲春夢，現在夢醒了。從今以後，總是捏頭關了門，一些也不想什麼J。也請嬸娘原諒我，別問我那些回答小出的話，也別問，我那些不願意回答的話」。葉二太太看維城神色還好，也不追究下去，每日裏做幾個可口的菜給他吃。有人來我維城，只說上蘇州唸書去了，沒有在家。維城老是關了雙梅書屋的門，對他父親愛棠公母親厲太夫人遺像　前長跽着嘴裏喃喃的，往往是半小時一小時不站起來。從新年到了暮春，從暮春到了盛夏，世德堂四圍的大樹，又綠又肥，他一</p>
<p>這一陣倒是好了，費長河好久沒有上葉家來糾纏小淸；葉二太太和翠珍　，都沒有什麽病痛。而夙昔被維城繫念的人，像惟一的知已黃龍。係有着殺父之仇的陳猶龍的兒子國器女兒國芳，都沒有消息。眨貶眼到了國曆八月上旬，維城住在家裏，一直是孤陋寡聞，伏處到半年以上，煩悶是到了極點，憤懣到了極點，不由他不是靜極思動。他是月明之夜回來的，現在就想趁月明之夜，出去蹓躂一下。他則了門，信步走了去，只聽得一陣靡靡之音，有人歌着後庭花的歌曲，接着是哈天撲地的諱笑聲。他怕家裏人覺察，帶着傷感的情緒，趕走了回來。果然的，阿興已是走到後邊去問：「誰則了大門走出去的」。維城忙接應　：「是我。阿興，前面村子，有人歌唱，是些什麽人」？阿興道：「少爺不知道，有人打什麼歌舞團班子，預備釗上海去賣錢」。維城長嘆了一聲。（二五七）</p>

<h3>西藏政情摭拾</h3>
<p>— 白虹</p>
<p>西藏向有秘密國之稱，而久爲英人所垂涎，其地西部與南部，均與印度，及英屬之不丹，尼泊爾，相接壤，北東兩面，則與新疆，靑海，西康，毘連，當此西亞風雲緊張，印度旣成國際要角，貼隣之西藏，自益將爲人所重視，友人吳君前任職於蒙藏委員會有年，熟悉藏情，屢成零星函告，茲特於爲述，以饗讀者。</p>
<p>（一）從班禪達賴說起：</p>
<p>班禪與達賴，原係藏人對法王之尊號，而並非人名，（班禪達賴均各有其本名，　後詳。）兩者同爲黃敎祖師宗喀巴之大弟子，世傳其衣缽，達賴駐前藏拉薩之布達拉寺，已傳至第十三輩：班禪則駐後藏日喀則之札什倫布寺，已傳至第九輩，達賴本蒙古語大海之意，喩福慧廣如大海，藏又意爲最高權力統治者。班禪乃梵文班智達之簡稱，爲對學者尊稱，謂博學多能，廣大無匹，兩者之地位，當然達賴高於班禪。</p>
<p>（二）政敎分合之回顧；</p>
<p>考西藏歷史在明代永樂以前，原爲紅敎時代，政敎係分立，政權由國王治理，敎權則由法王掌執。自宗喀巴倡宗敎革命，傳佈黃敎圓寂後，遺囑達賴，班禪二大弟子，世以化身轉世，當時第一世達賴各「根敦珠巴」，因係國王之子，捨王位出家受戒，故具有二重資格，乃以法王而兼藏王，此爲政敎合一之開始，惟以後則時有分合，大致視每一輩達賴本人之才力而定。</p>
<p>（三）實際之政治組織</p>
<p>藏地最高行政機關爲「葛厦」，直譯之爲行政廳，其性質彷彿內閣制之閣議，由四「葛倫」所組成，總攬全藏立法，司法，行政之大權，秉承達賴之命，以合議制行使之。「葛倫」意譯爲高組政務官，其性質彷彿內閣制之各部長，人數例定三俗一僧，組織會議，行使一切政權，其產生力法，　由達賴任命，無一定任期，在達賴與葛倫之間，近年又另有一「司倫」，直譯爲政治大臣，係承上啟下性質，惟對葛厦決議案件，並無權變更，日常輔助達賴辦理行政事務，彷彿內閣制之總理，此職例由俗人充任，其產生方法，原須山各大呼圖克圖（喇嘛尊稱，一稱活佛。）選舉，近改由達賴指定，多屬其戚族。</p>
<p>（四）前達賴與前班禪</p>
<p>達賴已傳至十三輩，班禪亦傳至第九輩，十三輩達頓名「阿旺羅布藏塔布克嘉錯」，係於淸光緒二年轉世，當昔年英兵入藏時，曾逃入內地，一度來北平，爲人頗有幹才，後將藏王「丁傑德林穆」免職，而以其表姪「堯杞冷青」爲司倫，所有藏中政軍敎大權，全在其掌握中，於民國廿二年，在藏圓寂。</p>
<p>第九輩班禪名「洛桑曲金，」係於淸光緒九年轉世，因與達賴不睦，於民國十三年離藏來內地，後爲國府羅致，廿三年任爲國府委員，及西陲宣化使。曾在京·抗·滬駐節，後西去內蒙，靑海，旋於二十六年冬，亦以病圓寂於靑海玉樹行轅。</p>
<p>（五）現當局結澤熱增：</p>
<p>按藏文「結澤」爲代理統治者之意，熱增係人名，藏中慣例：老達賴圓寂後，新達賴未轉世前，由人民公舉英明精幹之呼圖克圖，代理其職務，熱增即爲十三輩達賴圓寂後，被選爲代理統治之人。此公籍隸靑海：有才識，有魄力，二十八年夏，曾將司倫堯杞冷靑免職，現爲　藏實際之最高權力者。</p>
<p>（六）小達賴小班禪</p>
<p>依慣例：老達賴圓寂後，耶應派人向各方尋覓靈童，並舉行抽籤決定。但十三輩達賴於二十二年圓寂，直至二十九年二月二十二日，始於拉薩舉行坐床（即位）典禮，渝府曾派蒙藏委員會委員長吳忠信，前往參加。此十四輩達賴名「拉木登珠，」時年六歲，生於西海西寗公綳地方祈家川，有兩兄為塔爾寺小活佛，仝時所獲靈童，尙有西康三十九族碧儒地方一名，又西藏山南們珠嶺地方一名，但因熱增騐掛，觀海，及護法降神所示，均與拉木登珠符合，並經僧俗大會公認爲十三輩轉世，故未舉行抽簽手續，渝府亦以明令確定。</p>
<p>至第十輩班禪，擄上年康定消息：甘孜班禪行轅，派來尋訪轉世靈童之人，已分南北兩路查訪，於七月初在理化縣屬濯桑地方，尋獲靈童一卯土登奪吉，」康定折多增人，二十七年舊曆十一月二日，已迎住濯桑會拉寺，如何結果，尚無所聞。實則藏中之對於班禪，已不啻告朔之餼羊矣。</p>

<h3>Discussion on the Price Problem</h3>
<p>Although the price problem is not a new one in Shanghai, it has been seriously threatening the lives of millions of citizens in Shanghai day by day in recent years. If there is no proper and perfect countermeasure to this problem, the impact on the lives of all Shanghai citizens is self-evident, and even the entire peace zone cannot but suffer serious consequences. Recently, it was reported that the Sino-Japanese Chamber of Commerce has jointly formed an economic committee to seek new countermeasures for prices. This is very important to the citizens. We respectfully offer the following suggestions:</p>
<p>First of all, we must understand the crux of the price problem in order to find a fundamental solution; otherwise, it will inevitably be "doing twice the work with half the results," just like past efforts. Practical observation shows that the occurrence of the price problem is due to (1) a certain degree of inflation of currency; (2) hoarding; (3) sluggish production; and (4) an increase in the degree of demand for war materials after the war, resulting in a certain degree of shortage of materials. In addition, the stagnation of transportation and transport has also, to a certain extent, directly and indirectly aggravated the price problem, but the main crux lies in the four major reasons mentioned above. Because, if the increase in currency issuance does not find a way to make it "recirculate," or does not find a way to introduce it into productive enterprises, then those additional chips will promote the rise in prices. What's more, those who hold mobile assets are desperately looking for all opportunities to engage in speculation and hoarding. The more they hoard, the higher the prices rise. The higher the prices rise, the greater the expenditures of the government and various agencies, and therefore the issuance of currency continues to increase. On the other hand, due to the coercion of mobile assets, the temptation of the profiteering of speculation and hoarding, and other environmental reasons, production is becoming increasingly sluggish, while the degree of consumption of materials in various aspects is increasing day by day. In this way, materials are in short supply, showing a huge distance between supply and demand, which in turn promotes high prices and speculation and hoarding activities. If we want to thoroughly solve the price problem, we must grasp the above four fundamental reasons that affect each other and start from here, that is; we must tighten the currency, strictly prohibit hoarding, develop production, conserve consumption, and increase materials.</p>
<p>First, in terms of tightening the currency, it is hoped that the amount of issuance will be reduced. At the same time, the government must implement thrift, avoid any waste, must cut down parallel institutions, and severely punish acts of fraud, self-interest, and corruption and extravagance. Accumulate to make the issued currency and private mobile assets invested in the production enterprises necessary for the stability of the national life. Second, in terms of banning hoarding, we must conduct thorough investigations, and what should be duly noted is that we cannot rely solely on intelligence and accusations, because these can only be used as a reference in case of emergency. As for the investigation and registration procedures, they must be simple, and the registration time may be extended. For finance, the secret operation of commercial firms by a small number of banks and money houses to carry out hoarding should be strictly prohibited. As for hoarding households, we should start from the big ones, crack down on them at high places, punish one as a warning to a hundred, and never just focus on small hoarding households, ignore big hoarding tigers, and even more so, do not indulge big hoarding tigers out of face, giving people a bad impression. Third, in terms of increasing production, we must do our best to support private industries, especially small-scale production enterprises. Not only should we abolish all unreasonable obstacles, but we should also actively provide assistance. In terms of raw material collection, capital adjustment, transportation of products, and donations and taxes, the Sino-Japanese authorities must provide more convenience to private industry and commerce. Fourth, in terms of material cooperation, in order to supply the needs of the Greater East Asia War, the people must truly endure suffering; however, the authorities should have a unified and reasonable method, and should do everything possible to reduce the inconvenience and suffering of the people, especially small and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises.</p>
<p>In addition, the most important thing is that in the control or management of materials and prices, we must pay attention to the following points; first, the executive agencies must be unified, so as to avoid the suffering of the industrial and commercial sectors from "not knowing what to do," and also increase work efficiency. Secondly, for all industries and businesses, we must adopt an attitude of assistance everywhere, and we cannot rely solely on principles, solely on orders, and we must avoid rash punishment, so that producers do not know what to do. Third, the procedures for control and management must be as simple, rapid, and flexible as possible, because one second of delay by the competent authority will cause great losses to all industries and businesses. Finally, regarding the personnel for control and management, they must be selected with extreme caution, because "having a governing law but not having a governing person" will ruin the excellent methods.</p>
<p>What we want to solemnly appeal to the authorities is that the price problem is a major problem at present, which cannot be solved by a single order, a principle, or one or two institutions. We must start from the root and at the same time obtain the cooperation of the people.</p>
<p>Translations and Commentary</p>
<h3>Recent New Lineup in Europe - Editorial of the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun on December 22</h3>
<p>On the 19th, a meeting of representatives from Germany, Italy, and France was held at the German General Headquarters. Following this, on the 20th, it was announced in Lisbon that Spain and Portugal had formed the Iberian Union.</p>
<p>Both of these events are of great significance. Regarding the former, although the results of the talks have not been announced, France must be the center of the agenda, and the content of the talks is not difficult to guess. Since the United States and Britain invaded North Africa, France's international status has suddenly entered a delicate state. Therefore, the Vichy government has the need to re-explicitly express its cooperation with the Axis powers. In fact, both Pétain and Laval have declared full cooperation against the Axis. It goes without saying that further discussions on the matter of full cooperation have to be held. The meeting on the 19th under the auspices of Hitler was probably this meeting for discussions.</p>
<p>The formation of the Iberian connection is no less important than the French issue in terms of its significance. In terms of geographical relations, the Iberian Peninsula is of great importance in this decisive war. Therefore, due to the US-British offensive in North Africa, it has suddenly placed itself at the center of the war. It is like a leaf drifting in a violent wind. As far as the peninsula itself is concerned, being in such a situation also involves great danger. Every move it makes can have a great impact on the belligerent countries. Now, the US-British invading forces are not only stalled on the Tunisian line, but, due to the Axis counter-offensive, they are instead retreating backwards. The US and Britain originally resort to any means to achieve their aggressive goals. It is impossible to know what they will do now that the expeditionary forces in North Africa are at a crossroads of life and death.</p>
<p>In the west of the Iberian Peninsula, Spain and Portugal stood upright before this crisis and established a strong connection; this is a matter of rejoicing not only for the two countries themselves, but also for the entire future of the war. (Translated by Mu)</p>
<h3>British Troops and Tegol's Forces Occupy French Somaliland - The Red Sea Gateway's Important Military Strategic Position - An Agreement is Signed for the Allied Powers to Take Over</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 29th, Allied News Agency - According to Vichy's news last night, British troops have, together with Tegol's forces, invaded French Somaliland. Allied aircraft flew over Djibouti, the capital of Somaliland, on the 27th of this month to distribute leaflets, saying that Tegol's troops had entered Somaliland. At 6 p.m. that evening, British troops and Tegol's troops had arrived three kilometers west of the main French defense line.</p>
<p>Vichy, 28th, Havas News Agency - It was officially announced that British troops and Tegol's forces have entered French Somaliland. The acting governor, Dupont, has telegraphed this news to the Colonial Ministry. This colony has resisted the British blockade for two years with remarkable results and is the most loyal to the motherland among the French colonies. Its position is at the entrance to the Red Sea and the end of the Abyssinian Railway, which is strategically important. It has an area of ​​8,800 square miles and a population of 69,000, of which Europeans account for 1,970. Djibouti is the capital, with a population of 12,000.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 29th, Allied News Agency - The announcement from London, relayed here today, stated that British troops, accompanied by Tegol's troops, entered French Somaliland on Sunday morning, seizing France's last territory in Africa. British Commander Major General Fox, Tegol's representative Zhang Sai'er, and French Somaliland's acting Governor General Dupont have signed an "agreement" stipulating that French Somaliland be taken over by the Allied Powers. This agreement was signed at Chebel at 8:15 a.m. yesterday and put into effect immediately.</p>
<p>Vichy, 29th, Havas News Agency - Details have been obtained here regarding the invasion of French Somaliland by British troops and Tegol's forces, stating that a foreign aircraft dropped leaflets over Djibouti on Sunday morning, informing the residents of the Tegol forces' invasion of Somaliland. The colonial troops' reconnaissance aircraft detected several trains and many trucks loaded with troops entering the interior of the country on Sunday. By Monday morning, the enemy troops had arrived at Keber, which is located on the railway line from Djibouti to Ababa. It is also learned that the fortress projects of Bouette and Maigada have been occupied. The negotiations between General Hodgkinson, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in Abyssinia, and the Acting Governor of French Somaliland suddenly broke down, so that the US military did not have time to take the same steps. According to previous news, Washington is planning to occupy French Somaliland with US troops.</p>
<h3>Tegol Meets with Eden - Important Talks Held - Tegol's Visit to the US May Be Realized</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 29th, Allied News Agency - According to London news received here, Tegol visited the British Foreign Office on the 28th to meet with Foreign Secretary Eden and hold important talks.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 29th, Havas News Agency - According to London, British Foreign Secretary Eden met with General Tegol yesterday. Londoners see this as a sign of increasingly tense diplomatic and political activities in London, Washington, and Algiers after Darlan's assassination. It has not been announced whether Tegol discussed plans to visit the United States during his meeting with Eden.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 29th, Havas News Agency - Well-informed sources in London claim that General Tegol has not completely abandoned his plans to visit the United States due to recent developments in North Africa.

<h3>Records of the East Asia Economic Roundtable Conference (2) Translated from the late November issue of "Domei Juho" (Allied Ten-Day Report)</h3>
<p>Speeches by Representatives</p>
<p>Mr. Ruan Zhenduo, Minister of Economy of Manchukuo</p>
<p>Mr. Ruan Zhenduo, Minister of Economy of Manchukuo, reviewed the ten-year history of Manchukuo's construction. During the first five years after the founding of the nation, all efforts were devoted to the preparation of basic matters. From the fourth year of Kangde (1937), he hoped to strengthen national defense production capacity on this foundation and establish a self-sufficient system, thus starting the First Five-Year Industrial Development Plan. Soon after, in view of the outbreak of the China Incident, it became necessary to expand and strengthen the plan dramatically.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the Second World War, the German-Soviet war, and the Greater East Asia War broke out one after another, creating many difficult situations. However, thanks to the unified spirit of cooperation between Japan and Manchukuo, these difficulties were overcome one by one, and the following results were achieved:</p>
<p>The main achievements of each sector of the First Five-Year Plan, with the year Kangde 3 (1936) as 100, the actual results in Kangde 8 (1941) were:</p>
<p>In the agricultural sector: sorghum 116%, millet 115%, corn 148%, rice 330%, oats 383%, cotton 156%, kenaf 232%, flax 546%, wild silk 129%, tobacco 1,083%, sugar beet 456%.</p>
<p>In the commercial production sector: horses 105%, cattle 120%, pigs 109%, sheep 125%, wool 130%</p>
<p>In the mining and industrial sector: pig iron 219%, steel ingots 154, steel材 264%, coal 178%, lead 1,223%, zinc 398%, copper 517%, asbestos 4,828%, ammonium sulfate 104%, salt 150%, soda ash 545%, sodium carbonate 3,500%, lead 1,666%, Pulp 790% (made from soft linen, cotton cloth, or bark, etc. Translator's note), liquid fuel 160%.</p>
<p>In general, compared with the results before the implementation of the plan, it is undeniable that there has been a leap forward.</p>
<p>Welcoming the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country this year, under the new situation, Manchukuo is attempting to establish and implement the Second Economic Construction Plan. As its fundamental policy, we want to aim at the rapid establishment of a self-sufficient economy within the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, fully accomplish the important mission of constructing and developing basic industries suitable for Manchukuo's resources, and develop and promote industries that must be established locally. At the same time, in view of the achievements of the First Economic Construction, we hope to strive for the balanced development of various industrial fields, so that comprehensive economic strength can be enriched and enhanced.</p>
<p>According to the above fundamental policy, the scope of planned industries is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>First, as advantageous basic resource industries suitable for Manchuria, and which make a great contribution to the establishment of a self-sufficient sphere economy, such as agricultural products, iron and steel, hydroelectric power generation, coal, light metals, salt, organic synthetic chemical products, etc. Among them, special emphasis should be placed on iron and steel and agricultural products.</p>
<p>Second, many industries that are necessary to be maintained locally as a frontline base. In order to enhance these planned industries, the cultivation and maintenance of daily necessities industries and light industries, which aim to enrich and supplement the comprehensive economic strength, are also important tasks that cannot be ignored. When carrying out the above tasks, on the one hand, existing equipment should be utilized and mobilized, and at the same time, new equipment should be saved, and the utilization of local resources and indigenous capital should be promoted as much as possible.</p>
<p>In addition to the above plans, the wartime emergency economic countermeasures currently being implemented in our country include the following:</p>
<p>First, to enhance the production of wartime essential materials in Japan in order to increase the supply to Japan.</p>
<p>Second, to strive to save the consumption of essential materials and thoroughly encourage the use of substitutes for these materials in order to contribute to the enrichment of war resources. In terms of producing essential materials, we must strive to suppress expectations of Japan in order to improve domestic self-sufficiency. At the same time, the capacity for allocation and consumption must be strengthened even more.</p>
<p>Third, to carefully reflect on the adoption of a uniform control method for the economic system, and in connection with the control of production, distribution, consumption, and prices, to make comprehensive adjustments to the current system in order to completely rationalize the system and its operation.</p>
<p>Fourth, in view of the stability of finance and currency as an absolute foundation for carrying out a long-term economic war, on the one hand, to establish a firm method for dealing with all special circumstances, and at the same time, in order to enhance savings, to launch the Kyowa Kai movement, the National Savings Movement, and to promote the absorption of purchasing power through "increased new taxes" and other measures. Also, in order to prevent malignant inflation, on the one hand, to reorganize and improve the allocation mechanism and rationalize the allocation, and at the same time, to create an economic balance fund system to give the greatest attention to the implementation of wartime price policy.</p>
<h3>Allied Counteroffensive Thwarted, North African War Situation Gradually Stabilizes, German Troops Consolidate Positions West of Tunis Port, Axis Powers Claim Air Supremacy</h3>
<p>Berlin, 29th, Domei News Agency - According to news from the North African front here, since the 25th, British and American forces have launched several counteroffensives in the Atlas Mountains area in an attempt to recapture various key points, but they have been repelled by the Axis forces. The Axis forces are still firmly defending the key points in the eastern Atlas Hills. In addition, a large unit of the French Foreign Legion, with tanks as the vanguard, attempted to counterattack the central Tunisian front, but was also repelled. Recently, the entire war situation seems to have entered a stable state. In addition, the Axis air force has repeatedly bombed the anti-Axis military concentrations and transportation vehicles and railways in the Tunisian border area, destroying two anti-Axis reconnaissance aircraft. A U.S. military depot near Mejez el Bab was hit and destroyed.</p>
<p>Tangier, 29th, Huitong News Agency - A communique from the Allied Headquarters in Tunisia stated that due to heavy rain in Tunisia, there has been no major battle. British and American forces have intensified reconnaissance work and have had several minor contacts with the enemy, with some prisoners taken.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 28th, Havas News Agency - There was frequent activity on both sides of the North African front yesterday. According to German sources, after the German forces occupied the town of Mejez el Bab, they immediately began to consolidate their positions. Mejez el Bab is located 20 miles southwest of Tebourba, with a population of about 2,500. It is the railway center west of Tunis and the key to the Mejerda River basin. U.S. forces had built good fortifications here, but the U.S. forces did not resist when the Axis forces attacked. The area is now completely in the hands of the German forces. From here south, west of Zaghouan, near the Fass Bridge, the German forces yesterday repelled the British and American allied forces and occupied several strategic high grounds. West of Kairouan, the German forces also occupied a mountain pass and several high grounds, which are sufficient to control the highway from Kairouan to Bizerte. So far, the British and American forces have lost the good positions they had previously occupied and have been forced to withdraw westward into the mountains. In addition, yesterday, U.S. aircraft bombed the ports of Bizerte and Sfax, and five four-engine bombers were shot down by German forces. The British air force also attempted to bomb the port of Bizerte, but was intercepted by German Messerschmitt 109 aircraft, which shot down several British aircraft. German aircraft also bombed the transportation lines of the port of Algiers and the enemy convoy near the port of Bougie. An enemy cargo ship of 10,000 tons was hit and damaged. In addition, the Italian air force also bombed the port of Bône at night, and several fires were seen after being hit. They also strafed the enemy barracks near Black Cape. Another enemy convoy was attacked in the waters off North Africa, and an enemy giant freighter was sunk.</p>
<p>Rome, 29th, Huitong News Agency - An article in the Italian "Aviation Magazine" stated that the timetable for the British and American invasion of French North Africa has been shelved due to the interference of the Axis air force. The Axis air force, departing from Sicily and Sardinia, prevented the British and American forces from landing in Bizerte, so the British and American forces had to land at unfavorable bases. The Axis forces were able to dispatch a large army to land in Tunisia in the shortest possible time, also thanks to the assistance of the air force. Axis transport aircraft transported a large number of troops to Tunisia in adverse weather conditions. In the first phase of the Tunisian war, the Axis air force has achieved air supremacy in the area. In the second phase of the war, the Axis aircraft still occupy a considerable important position, assisting the Axis forces on the ground to expand and consolidate their occupied positions. In the first phase of the war, all the Axis air force's ground paper weaving industry has been completed, and the difficulties encountered have also been solved.</p>

<h3>Calcutta Suffers Fifth Air Raid, India's Wartime Industrial Center, Japanese Aviator Discusses Night Attack</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 29th, Domei News Agency - According to a British communique from New Delhi issued here today, Japanese aircraft attacked Calcutta (the fifth attack in eight days) and two other locations in eastern India at 4:00 a.m. on Monday. After the fifth attack on Calcutta, several fires broke out. Japanese aircraft concentrated on bombing military industrial facilities. The British communique also stated that it could not guarantee that Calcutta would be completely free from Japanese air raids. Calcutta is the center of British war industry in India. It was first attacked by Japanese aircraft on December 20, and then bombed three more times on the 22nd, 24th, and 25th.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 29th, Domei News Agency - Army Air Force Captain Miyajima, who participated in the fourth attack on Calcutta, recently revealed that Japanese aircraft heavily damaged military targets in Calcutta, the largest air base in eastern India. Japanese aircraft bombed military targets in Calcutta three times on December 20, 22, and 24, and then attacked the area for the fourth time on the night of December 25. Captain Miyajima described the experience to a Yomiuri Hochi Shimbun reporter as follows: "When our aircraft departed from the base and flew across the Indian Ocean, the moonlight was bright, but we flew west for a long time in a strong wind of 50 meters per second before reaching the skies over the Bay of Bengal. Dense fog obscured our vision. When we first saw land, we caught a glimpse of the Ganges estuary shimmering in the moonlight. Our aircraft forcefully formed a battle formation and ascended again. After a while, the moonlight was bright and the ground below was exceptionally clear. We then consulted the map and flew north, finally reaching Calcutta at 1:20 a.m. The city seemed to be asleep under perfect light control. However, as soon as our aircraft reached the skies over the city, the high-altitude artillery unit near Fort William suddenly roared, and the high-altitude artillery unit at Alipore airfield in the south of the city also fired fiercely. Shells exploded around the aircraft like shimmering fireworks. Our aircraft dived low and dropped bombs on targets such as King George's Dockyard, Dum Dum Airfield, and Alipore Airfield. When we finished the mission and started to fly back, we saw four fires breaking out at King George's Dockyard, indicating that the bombing was successful. At the same time, we also saw aircraft from the Hinode unit still bombing the oil tanks around the dockyard. We did not encounter any enemy aircraft resistance at that time. After leaving Calcutta, our aircraft reduced its altitude and saw that the friendly aircraft were following behind, which was very gratifying. Not long after returning to the base, the Hinode unit, which had destroyed eight enemy oil tanks, also returned safely. The fourth long and short-range bombing of Calcutta has been completely successful."</p>

<h3>Regulations for the Establishment and Promulgation of the Three Provinces Taxation Bureau and Investigation Office</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) - The Ministry of Finance, considering the numerous unified taxation matters in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, and to facilitate micro-collection, has abolished the Taxation General Bureau. It has separately established the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provincial Taxation Bureaus, as well as the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provincial Stamp, Tobacco, and Alcohol Tax Bureaus. Simultaneously, branch bureaus are established in various counties, responsible for handling the collection of unified taxes, stamp, tobacco, and alcohol taxes within their respective provincial areas. The heads of the respective provincial bureaus have also been officially appointed. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance has already formulated and promulgated the organizational regulations for the aforementioned provincial taxation bureaus and stamp, tobacco, and alcohol tax bureaus to begin their organizational establishment.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) - The Ministry of Finance is actively promoting taxation matters. Previously, the Central Tax Police Corps, directly under the Ministry, was responsible for investigating and cracking down on tax evasion. Now, considering that the Central Tax Police Corps is of great importance for investigating and cracking down on salt smuggling and other matters, and may inevitably have shortcomings, it has been decided to organize provincial tax investigation offices, responsible for assisting the provincial taxation bureaus and stamp, tobacco, and alcohol tax bureaus in investigating and cracking down on tax evasion. It is reported that the Ministry has now officially promulgated the organizational regulations and has formally organized and established these offices, commencing their work.</p>
<h3>Express Shipping Between Jiaxing and Haiyan to Begin on New Year's Day</h3>
<p>Jiaxing, 29th (Central News Agency) - Since the commencement of rural pacification in Jiaxing, the market has become increasingly prosperous, and transportation has become increasingly developed. Fixed boats travel back and forth from various pacified areas. However, there are still no direct boats between Haiyan and Jiaxing, which is particularly inconvenient for transportation. Now, local merchants and residents are preparing to open an express boat service between Jiaxing and Haiyan, carrying passengers and goods, making round trips on the same day. This has been approved by the authorities and is scheduled to begin its maiden voyage on New Year's Day.</p>
<h3>Abundant Iron Ore in Anshan, Southern Manchuria; Extremely Convenient for Mining</h3>
<p>Changchun, 28th (Havas News Agency) - The Manchuria Daily recently published an article discussing the issue of developing Anshan into an industrial center, stating that Anshan is rich in raw materials, making it a central area for steel smelting and casting. Most of the semi-circular area of ten kilometers wide in the district is controlled by the Showa Steel Works, with twelve iron ore locations and a total of 200 million tons of ore reserves. Although the quality is not very good, the ore layer is only a few hundred meters thick, making it extremely easy to mine. Mining explosives are made on-site. There are also three mine shafts 56 kilometers northeast of Anshan, which are being mined by the Showa Steel Works. Not far south of Anshan are the world's largest and finest clay and mica mines, which can be used to manufacture the finest refractory bricks. Although there are no coal mines in the area, coal can be transported from Fushan, Kaiping, and various parts of North China for supply. In addition, steel smelting solution and water can also be obtained nearby. Anshan is located along the South Manchuria Railway, so transportation is not difficult. Furthermore, it is only 300 kilometers from Dalian and only 100 kilometers from Yingkou. A canal will soon be excavated between Yingkou, Anshan, and Shenyang to facilitate transportation. In short, the prosperity of the Anshan area depends on the amount of steel produced, and steel is a major raw material for the Japanese arms industry, which goes without saying.</p>
<h3>New Japanese Shipping Company Established to Facilitate Wartime Transportation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Domei News Agency) - It was learned today that the shipping department of Mitsui Bussan Kaisha will be dissolved, and a new Mitsui Shipping Company will be established to facilitate wartime transportation. The new company has a capital of 50 million yen and will take over the routine work previously handled by the shipping department of Mitsui Bussan Kaisha. The new company's head office will be located in Tokyo, and branch offices will be established in Yokohama, Kobe, Dalian, Shanghai, Saigon, and Bangkok. According to shipping industry sources, the establishment of the new company will make a significant contribution to the smoother transportation of important materials between Japan and the countries of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
<h3>France Arrests Terrorists</h3>
<p>Paris, 29th (Domei News Agency) - French Premier Laval, based on the results of his talks with the heads of Germany and Italy, has decided to begin by rounding up undesirables in the country. According to a French authorities announcement on the 28th, 70 foreigners and Jews and 80 other undesirables have been rounded up in the past few days. It is also reported that as a result of the inspection of communist elements, 550 pounds of explosives, 6,500 incendiary bombs, and 330 pounds of chemicals were confiscated, and two secret printing presses were closed down. In addition, 136 people were arrested on suspicion of being communists.</p>
<h3>Strike Wave in Bolivia; US Does Not Plan to Interfere</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 28th (Havas News Agency) - According to news from the Bolivian capital and Washington, a strike wave has broken out in Bolivia, and all tin mines owned by the United States in the country have been affected. The position of the US Ambassador to Bolivia in the labor dispute has aroused great discussion. US Secretary of State Hull stated at a press conference today that my ambassador has telegraphed me explaining everything. I am very satisfied that he did not attempt to interfere in the Bolivian labor unrest. He inquired about the amendment to the labor law and how it would affect the cost of tin production, but this was a natural action, as the United States is the largest buyer of this important war material.</p>
<h3>War Affects South American Industry; Raw Materials Cannot Be Exported; Machines Cannot Be Imported</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 28th (Havas News Agency) - According to news from the capitals of Latin American countries, since the outbreak of the European war, transportation between Latin American countries and Europe has been cut off, resulting in various difficulties for industry. Public utilities in Argentina and Brazil are particularly inconvenient, as various professions in these countries use the metric system commonly used in Europe. However, South American commercial firms are now unable to obtain the necessary parts, and American industry, which adopts the British system, cannot supply South America with the necessary equipment. It will take several years to solve this difficulty. After the United States entered the war, the situation improved slightly, but since the Allies lacked ships and the submarine war expanded to the entire Atlantic Ocean, the situation has worsened again. South American countries are now suffering from the inability to export raw materials, resulting in mountains of coffee stocks in Brazil. In the United States, however, restrictions have been placed on the purchase of coffee. In Latin American countries, imports from the United States have always been dominated by the necessary industrial machinery, such as agricultural implements shipped from the United States to Brazil, which have apparently decreased. According to news from the Brazilian capital, the amount was 3,600 tons last year, but has decreased to 380 tons this year.</p>
<h3>Tragic Train Crash in Canada; Over 100 Casualties</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Ottawa, a train crash occurred on the railway line 30 miles south of here last night, killing 32 people and injuring 114.</p>
<p>Ottawa, 29th (Havas News Agency) - An unprecedented train derailment occurred in Ontario yesterday, killing 28 people and injuring 114. One army lieutenant and five soldiers were also among the victims.</p>
<h3>Unrest in Egyptian Political Situation</h3>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 28th (Havas News Agency) - A dispatch from Cairo reports that the Egyptian political situation has recently become turbulent again. Several members of parliament from Prime Minister Nahas's Wafd Party have reportedly been arrested. According to unconfirmed reports, clashes have occurred between British troops and Egyptian students in a town near Cairo.</p>
<h3>Overview of Transportation and Economy in North Borneo Over the Past Year</h3>
<p>Kuching, 29th (Central News Agency) - Since North Borneo was pacified by the Japanese army, it has assumed an important task in the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and its future holds unlimited hope. The following is an introduction to the economic construction situation in North Borneo over the past year.</p>
<p>Transportation</p>
<p>The entire transportation system of Borneo, apart from shipping, is virtually nonexistent. Moreover, due to the shallow coastline, the water volume of each estuary is very shallow, making navigation by larger ships virtually impossible. Before the war, there were 5 million tons of ships traveling along the coast. Since the outbreak of the war, coastal shipping has been completely cut off. Through the efforts of the Japanese authorities, 2 million tons of ships have resumed shipping. Roads are also quite scarce, and there are plans to modify or construct roads from Jesselton to Sandakan and from Borneo to Miri. In addition, in view of the importance of Sandakan, there are plans to make the port more perfect. Ships of 20,000 tons can now dock on their own, and it is expected that the port will become the central cemetery of North Borneo in the future.</p>
<p>Agriculture</p>
<p>North Borneo is rich in fruits, among which jackfruit is famous for its delicious taste all over the world, and sold well all over the world before the war. In the future, it is planned to set up canning factories in Changdi to revitalize it. Other crops such as corn, pepper, and other agricultural crops cannot be planted in the coastal area, so they will be planted after disposing of the dense forests in the inland area. The authorities believe that this measure can both harvest primitive forests and increase production, so they are vigorously encouraging it. As for the cultivation of rubber, it is now in a state of suspension, because rubber, like Philippine sugar, is an overproduced product in the East Asia exchange.</p>
<p>Underground Resources</p>
<p>Among the important resources in North Borneo, the most abundant is petroleum, and its future is promising. The current output is equivalent to that before the war. Other minerals such as iron, coal, gold, climbing ore, and mercury are also very abundant, and mercury is the most abundant, and is known as the first in the world, with a monthly output of several tons. The purpose of coal development is to supply the local needs of the south. Although the mineral resources of Borneo have not yet been investigated, the reserves are extremely abundant, and the future is truly immeasurable.</p>
<p>Macau Correspondence</p>
<h3>The Life of Soldiers in the Interior</h3>
<p>In October, the Guilin Ta Kung Pao published an editorial entitled "How to Repay the Soldiers at the Front," which aroused discontent and anger among the soldiers. Consider the following two examples:</p>
<p>First</p>
<p>I have a deep feeling hidden in my mind that I have long wanted to say but have not revealed. Seeing the Ta Kung Pao editorial "How to Repay the Soldiers at the Front," it unexpectedly revealed my deep feeling, and I felt very happy at the time. I would like to express my most sincere gratitude in the form of a share of the six million soldiers.</p>
<p>I am a student youth who continued to study in a high school in Hunan Province. Since the outbreak of the war, I voluntarily abandoned school life and joined the battlefield service work. Before long, I joined the × unit. From then on, I officially lived the life of a soldier. The treatment of our army is not as good as that of European and American countries because the national economy is not well-off. In the past two years, because of soaring prices, the lives of soldiers have been really hard.</p>
<p>In the past few years, the call for "military first, victory first" has spread to every corner of the country. During this long-term war, in principle, the country should use all its strength and wealth as possible in the military aspect. Considering the current treatment of soldiers, in today's national financial difficulties, we thousands of millions of comrades-in-arms naturally have no extravagant hopes for clothing and daily necessities. Just in terms of life, the current food for soldiers in general units is 24 taels per day for staple food (military rice) and 13 yuan per month for non-staple food, averaging 4 jiao and 3 fen per person per day. In today's expensive prices, may I ask: How much is left after buying firewood for 4 jiao and 3 fen per person? Just take rice as an example. Twenty-four taels of market rice per day (including hemp bags and transportation losses) can only be burned into a little more than three bowls of rice. It is enough for people in peacetime and the wealthy, but soldiers are either lying in trenches fighting all day or operating. How can we talk about nutrition if we rely on these two meals of six bowls a day?</p>
<p>Second</p>
<p>I am a soldier of the ×× unit. Because I saw the Ta Kung Pao editorial "How to Repay the Soldiers at the Front," everything described was the truth, which really touched my soul. It is exactly what I want to say in my heart. Indeed, the appeals of civil servants and the appeals of school teachers are all done by people, but few people care about the living conditions of our soldiers. We will not mention the past, and at the same time, we only hope that we can maintain the minimum standard of living. Now, our monthly salary of more than ten yuan is really too hard! When it comes to eating, there is no talk of vegetables. The only thing to eat with rice is a small bowl of boiled cabbage.</p>

<h3>Class A Retail Oil Shops Reopen Today; Total Allocation of 10,300 Loads; Must Be Sold Out in Four Days, Ending January 3rd</h3>
<p>The supply of edible oil in this port is expected to ease as batches of oil from Dalian arrive in Shanghai and soybeans are also loaded, which are pressed into soybean oil by oil presses for delivery. The bottom line is getting thicker day by day, so the panic can be eliminated. Yesterday was the last day of the four-day sales period for Group B. Starting today (30th), Class A oil shops will continue to sell oil for four days. Except for New Year's Day when sales will be suspended, sales will be available until 5:00 pm on January 3rd, not until January 5th. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Nature and Types of Retail Oil Shops</p>
<p>A total of 1,840 retail shops in the two concessions and Nanshi, Shanghai West, Zhabei, and Pudong have registered with the edible oil wholesale office to receive edible oil allocations. These retail edible oil shops can be divided into the following categories: 124 shops specializing in edible oil, 36 sauce shops, and 1,680 distilleries. The first of these registered edible oil retail shops all hang a price list of edible oil set by the edible oil wholesale office.</p>
<p>Still Sold in Two Groups, A and B</p>
<p>The above-mentioned types of edible oil retail shops have been divided into Class A for those with daily sales of more than one load and Class B for those with less than one load. Since the 22nd of this month, Class A and B have been selling edible oil for four days each. Yesterday was the last day of sale for Group B. Today is the start of the continuous sales period for Class A oil shops. Each person can still buy one catty of soybean oil in sequence according to the numbering method. The sales time is still from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm. Each catty is still sold for 7 yuan and 1 jiao including the donation.</p>
<p>Class A Continues Selling Until the 3rd</p>
<p>The total allocation of oil for Class A oil shops this time is 10,300 loads, which is equivalent to the amount available for ten days of door-to-door sales in the past. Now it is sold out in just four days in order to be universal. Therefore, Class A retail shops will be open from today, except for New Year's Day when they will be closed, and will be open until 5:00 pm on January 3rd. Group B retail shops are also expected to continue for four days until 5:00 pm on the 7th.</p>
<p>Source of Edible Oil on the Market This Time</p>
<p>The edible oil sold today is all soybean oil pressed from the soybeans recently loaded in Shanghai by local Shanghai pressing plants. The Group B retail edible oil allocated for the next period will generally still be supplied with barrel oil loaded in Dalian. At the same time, several joint guarantors in the two concessions will try to adopt a household-by-household oil supply system for the edible oil sold by retail shops in the area, and purchase oil with the oil purchase certificates issued by the general joint guarantor in order to reduce the suffering of squeezing and waiting. The amount of oil purchased specified in the oil purchase certificate is not uniform in each district. The Class A oil shops sold today will still follow the spleen number announced in the above decision, rotating in turn.</p>
<h3>Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama Invites the Press; About to Take Up New Post in Manchuria</h3>
<p>According to a Domei News Agency report from this port, Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama, spokesman for the Japanese Army in Shanghai, has been in Shanghai since June of this year, succeeding Lieutenant Colonel Akiyama.

<h3>Shipboard Warfare - A Dialogue</h3>
<p>Naval Shipbuilding Vice-Admiral - Kiyoshi Nagamura</p>
<p>Former Principal of Tokyo Higher Mercantile Marine School - Kunihiko Sugawa</p>
<p>Asahi Weekly Reporter</p>
<p>Translated from Asahi Weekly, December 27th (To be continued)</p>
<p>Japan's Ships Are Japan's Treasures</p>
<p>Sugawa: I believe we can confidently say that Japan's merchant ships are the best in the world. There's a perfect example. A long time ago, Osaka Shosen Kaisha had a ship called 〇〇 Maru, an excellent passenger ship of the 10,000-ton class. Unfortunately, that ship collided in the Pacific Ocean with a 10,000-ton cargo ship called 〇〇 Maru, belonging to the International Steamship Company. The bow of the cargo ship pierced the side of the passenger ship, creating a large hole in the engine room, and water rushed in. However, although the engine room was filled with water, no water penetrated any other part of the ship. This fact shows how tightly and leak-proof the ship was built. As for the cargo ship, only the bow was dented, with no major damage. At that time, lifeboats were lowered in the Pacific Ocean to transport all the passengers from the passenger ship to the cargo ship, which then towed the passenger ship back to Japan, thus saving it.</p>
<p>Nagamura: Indeed! This isn't just a triumph of shipbuilding; the quality of the crew also deserves praise!</p>
<p>Sugawa: Exactly. If it were a foreign ship, they might have abandoned the passenger ship. But Japanese sailors regard their ships as Japan's treasures and refused to let it sink, so they towed it back. Tugging was, of course, very difficult, and being towed was no easier! Because towing a 10,000-ton ship with another 10,000-ton ship, what would happen in bad weather, if a storm arose? The consequences are unimaginable. Yet at that time, laborers, sailors, cooks, and stokers, everyone united, worked together, and took on this difficult task. Although there are such examples in foreign countries, cases where people become neurotic, give up on themselves, and even engage in mutual slaughter on a ship where the future is uncertain, are too numerous to mention. However, Japanese ships can maintain perfect order, working together from beginning to end, all the way back to Japan. Here, I believe, we can prove the excellence of Japanese sailors and the robustness of ship construction.</p>
<p>Naval warfare has become common knowledge. Ships can be built desperately, and in a relatively short time, but to make them move, a large number of crew members is indispensable. If those crew members don't each possess a steadfast spirit, they cannot serve diligently. Therefore, the ship problem and the crew problem have both become the most critical issues at present. In today's situation, I believe that the problem of ships and the problem of sailors especially cannot but be fundamentally considered. There are many strategies for dealing with a long-term war, but I hope everyone recognizes the role ships play for Japan in a long-term war, and also understands that ships cannot move on their own; it is the sailors who make them move. Imbue the ship with the strong spiritual power of the sailors, and then Japan's ships will have a great role.</p>
<p>Gratitude for the Sailors</p>
<p>Reporter: So, what should the people in the rear hope for from the sailors?</p>
<p>Sugawa: I hope that the Japanese people will more fully understand that the current war is a war of transportation. Today, everyone knows that trucks are very useful, both inland and on the battlefield. They also know how important railway transport is. So, let's talk about the transport capacity of ships. Take, for example, a merchant ship that can carry 10,000 tons of cargo; such a merchant ship is not a very large ship. But to load 10,000 tons of cargo, if using trucks with a load capacity of two tons, it would take no less than five thousand trucks. If using trucks with a load capacity of ten tons, it would also take one thousand trucks. If forty trucks are connected to form a train, then it would take twenty-five trains to load 10,000 tons of cargo. This is the power of ships. I regard the role of ships in war as the same as each sailor answering the call to serve in the military and contributing their abilities. Whether passenger ships or cargo ships, in peacetime, they each serve society according to their performance. In wartime, they are called up, and if they are excellent passenger ships, or fast cargo ships, they become like warships, and can also be used as warships. Even fishing boats, along with the army's operations, have various uses during enemy landings. In short, no matter what kind of ship, regardless of its size, it is useful in war. It is not correct for people to think that useful ships must be excellent ships. Any ship is useful.</p>
<p>During the last European War, the German "Seeadler," which roamed the Atlantic and Indian Oceans and was known as the "Sea Devil," had a ship captain who commanded a sailing ship. He installed a motor on that sailing ship for auxiliary power and performed many amazing feats.</p>
<p>So, I believe that the people must truly recognize that ships are something that determine the fate of a country. In war, they have a significant mission; at the same time, there must also be a correct understanding of sailors. Therefore, when the people eat their three meals a day, if their rice is mixed with foreign rice, they must know that the foreign rice was brought by sailors risking their lives from Annam, Thailand, or Yangon, breaking through the enemy's guerrilla warfare network. Therefore, we cannot but be grateful for the contributions of ships. Otherwise, we would be ashamed to be a maritime nation. If there is a lot of foreign rice mixed in the rice, that is a sign of abundant food and safe ship navigation. But ships do not only transport foreign rice; they also carry all the materials necessary for war, so we should especially be happy if a lot of foreign rice is brought in.</p>
<p>Eliminating Sailors' Worries</p>
<p>I hope that the people will all have such a correct understanding, and show even more sympathy for sailors. Furthermore, we should consider methods of protection and relief. Germany and Italy both do this. In addition, countries like Europe and America also have considerable protection and relief measures for those who have served at sea for decades, and for the children and families of those who have died at sea. Therefore, sailors often leave port laughing, with no worries about the future. I believe that such measures are truly necessary. Because in this way, promising young people will be willing to go to sea and serve the country. Therefore, both the country and the people must diligently consider how to encourage outstanding young people to compete to go to sea and serve. I believe this is absolutely necessary for a long-term war.</p>
<p>Nagamura: This is indeed important.</p>
<p>Sugawa: During the Russo-Japanese War, I read something written by Puriboy, the paymaster of the Varyag. He became a prisoner after surrendering and was transferred to the warship "Asahi." According to what he wrote, "From the waters off Ulsan to Maizuru, I was very surprised. On the 'Asahi,' I could see combat drills being conducted at night. The Russian fleet had been completely annihilated, yet Japan was still conducting combat drills. From this, I realized the reason for Japan's victory? I couldn't help but stick out my tongue." That was their spirit!</p>

<h3>Who Plans for the People's Food? - Unified Purchase of Grain in Producing Areas - Division of Areas and Prohibition of Free Competitive Purchase - Adopt Allocation System Based on Actual Needs</h3>
<p>After the authorities of the two concessions implemented a system of rationing food based on population for Shanghai residents, they recently decided to find ways to appropriately increase the allocation of rice flour to ensure sufficient food supply for the residents. It is reported that starting from the 22nd period, in addition to allocating half a shēng of white rice per person, the amount of flour will be increased from one and a half jins to two jins. A reporter from Commercial News recently learned from rice industry sources that the authorities, in light of the good harvests in rice-producing areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui this year, with production exceeding previous years, have divided the producing areas into fourteen special zones to control the purchase of rice and grains. It is stipulated that merchants are prohibited from freely bidding; the authorized agencies will uniformly purchase the rice, and the rice obtained will be allocated to various places to maintain the people's food supply. Regarding Shanghai's food supply, after overall planning, it will be allocated to the Rice and Grain Management Office based on actual needs, and then distributed to designated rice shops for rationing. It is reported that a large amount has already been transported from the producing areas to Shanghai and stored in warehouses such as Taikoo and Zhejiang, so Shanghai's food supply can be guaranteed for the long term.</p>
<h3>Talk by Watari, Commissioner of Police - Strengthening the Police Force</h3>
<p>(Domei News Agency, Shanghai) Watari, Commissioner of Police of the Public Concession, stated yesterday while hosting news reporters that the Municipal Council is carrying out a plan to strengthen the police system in the second year of the Greater East Asia War. Preparations have been completed to enhance the effectiveness of police officers, especially Chinese police officers, and to expand the Japanese police officer section. The maintenance of security in the Public Concession depends on the cooperation between the police authorities and the Baojia self-defense corps, which has already shown remarkable success. Since the beginning of the year, efforts have been made to improve the Baojia system, and the progress made is largely due to the enthusiastic assistance of Chinese residents. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the police station has been reorganized four times. The fourth reform implemented the exclusive use of Japanese in official documents, thereby eliminating the former British and American influence in the police station.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Clearance Association Plans to Compile "Shanghai Clearance Documents"</h3>
<p>The first phase of Shanghai's clearance has been underway for four months. In order to record the actual situation of the clearance, the Shanghai Clearance Association has decided to compile "Clearance Documents" and has designated the association's secretariat to be responsible for the design, with the assistance of the propaganda department. A meeting of various units was convened on the 26th to decide to organize an editorial committee to handle the matter centrally. Yesterday (the 29th) at 2:00 PM, the editorial committee was formally established and held its first meeting, chaired by Zhang, the director of the secretariat. After reporting on the purpose of the meeting, discussions began on printing costs, classification principles, and other points, and decisions were made on all of them. It is expected that the manuscript will be completed by mid-February, the compilation and printing will be completed by early March, and publication will be in mid-March.</p>
<h3>Opening of Jingmei Cafe - Yi He Helps Education</h3>
<p>Jingmei Cafe on Nanjing Road opened the other day, and friends and relatives competed to send flower baskets to congratulate. The owner of the cafe, Mr. Ling Jianming, considered the flower baskets to be a waste and requested that they be converted into cash to donate to the newspaper's scholarship fund, hoping to arouse public sympathy and encourage everyone to follow suit to promote education. His enthusiasm for helping education is admirable. The list of donations in lieu of congratulatory gifts is listed below: Chen Longquan 40 yuan, Zhu Ruiqing, Zhao Zhiyan, Lu Zhigang, Li Linsen, Wu Yuling, Huang Dazhong 30 yuan each, Huang Heting, Lv Baofu, Huang Zongqi, Wang Zhibo, Pan Shuxian, Tang Tongsūn 15 yuan each, Qian Mujiao 1 yuan, totaling 331 yuan, with a balance of 100,911.12 yuan.</p>
<h3>Unregistered Radios - Re-register with the Management Office</h3>
<p>The deadline for the registration of wireless radios announced by the French Concession authorities on the 24th of this month has expired. The office set up at 7333 Route Ghisi has also been closed since yesterday. As for those who possess prohibited radios and have not yet registered, it is reported that they must go to the Wireless Radio Management Office at 316 Hardoon Building, Nanjing Road, before the 31st of this month to complete the registration.</p>
<h3>Ren Ci Charity Association Distributes Congee in Zhabei</h3>
<p>The Ren Ci Charity Association of Gaoshou Lane, Haining Road, is organizing winter relief. In addition to distributing winter clothing and general congee tickets in the central district, it will continue to set up a congee kitchen at Zhijiang Temple, Song Park Road, Zhabei, starting on the 12th of this month. More than a thousand nearby poor people register with the association daily to receive congee.</p>
<h3>Poverty Relief Fund Movement</h3>
<p>A letter from Shanghai Guangyi Shantang states that the organization's charitable activities, such as providing clothing and medical treatment, are based on the principles of charity and morality. However, in these troubled times, human hearts are in danger, and it is indeed not easy to secretly help the poor. Although the organization's funds are limited, it spares no effort to serve society. The clothing tickets sent have already been distributed to those in dire need. This letter expresses gratitude. Also, Mr. Cheng De kindly donated 200 yuan, leaving a balance of 5,537 yuan.</p>
<h3>Car Thief Captured</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 7:00 PM, the French Concession police received a tip that a large group of bicycle thieves were hiding at 71 Xiaohuwei, Hongqiao Road, West Shanghai. They immediately dispatched detectives to the address and arrested six people on the spot: Lü Wenyong, Zhou Desheng, Lu Xueyu, Ding Aqi, Qu Guibao, and Zhu Jinrong. They were taken to the police station. According to their confession, they had stolen four bicycles, which had been sold to 99 Tongren Street, Xujiahui, 77 Belle Road, 253 Rue de Monvel, and 169 Xinjiang Road, Zhabei. The detectives went to those addresses to retrieve the bicycles and brought the buyers to the police station for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Apprentice Falls While Lowering Rice</h3>
<p>Rong Dade, a 22-year-old from Guangdong, was an apprentice at Fulong Cloth Shop at 348 Jiangxi Road, fourth floor. Yesterday afternoon, the shop bought about 40 jins of rice. The apprentice used a rope to lower it from the fourth floor, but when he lowered it to the second floor, the apprentice could no longer hold on and fell from the fourth floor together with the rice, suffering serious injuries and in critical condition.</p>
<h3>Lost Boy Waiting to Be Claimed</h3>
<p>On the 22nd of this month at 8:00 PM, a lost boy was found at the intersection of Rue Massenet and Zhengjia Bridge. He has a round face, is about five years old, and is wearing a blue cloth long shirt. He was taken to the Lukiawan police station by the Chinese police and has been kept there for ten days. No family members have come to claim him. It is said that the child has a delicate face and does not look like he comes from a poor family. Lately, he has been crying day and night, calling for his mother. The police authorities hope that those who have lost a child will come to claim him.</p>
<h3>Lost Watch</h3>
<p>To whom it may concern, I, Xu Zaikang, boarded a streetcar on Rue Cardinal Foch this morning (the 29th) before 11:00 AM to go to the Bund. When getting off the car at the New World stop, I found a square gold-cased watch with an old leather strap left on the car. I handed it over to ticket seller "1031" to be turned in to the streetcar company for claiming. Please publicize this so that the loser can know where to retrieve it. Sincerely, Xu Zaikang, December 29th.</p>
<h3>Anti-British and American Association Requests the Municipal Council to Completely Eliminate the British and American Character of the Concession</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) The Shanghai Chinese National Anti-British and American Association previously obtained the support of hundreds of well-known figures in Shanghai, including Yuan Lüdeng, and jointly petitioned the Municipal Council to demand the complete elimination of the British and American character of the Shanghai Concession. Yesterday (the 29th) at 10:00 AM, they visited various bureaus of the Municipal Council to submit the petition. The association also plans to continue to make the same request to the Japanese Army and Navy authorities. The gist of the petition is that since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the British and American forces that have been fostered in East Asia for many years have been instantly eliminated. This is a great achievement of the brave Japanese soldiers, but even today, a year after the war, the Shanghai Public Concession still has roads named after British and Americans, and there are still monuments and bronze statues commemorating British and Americans. We firmly believe that the fundamental elimination of these symbols of hostile and aggressive forces to erase the shame of the citizens of Shanghai is also a way to eliminate obstacles to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The Chinese National Anti-British and American Association hereby suggests to your bureau that you consider the interests of the citizens of Shanghai and expedite the realization of this goal. We sincerely hope so.</p>

<h3>Gold Jewelry Exchange Rate Drops Below 3,000 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the listed price for gold jewelry at Shanghai gold shops was first listed at 100 yuan higher, at 2,950 yuan per liang (purchase price reduced by 300 yuan or more). There were still few transactions among the industry, and it had retreated to within 2,700 yuan. On that day, it sold at 2,730 yuan, dropping to 2,670 yuan, more than 100 yuan lower than the 5th, with a price increase of 60 yuan. Transactions were sparse. As for silver jewelry, each liang still showed 16 yuan. Transactions among the industry were further reduced to 16.5 yuan. Yesterday morning, the Shanghai Money Exchange further reduced interest rates by one point, suspending 1.7 jiao.</p>
<h3>Tianjin-Shanghai Exchange Rate Drops - Federal Currency Falls Another 2 Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the exchange price for military tickets among the industry was stable, between 5.5535 yuan. Small money houses and bank door prices were 5.56 yuan and 5.545 yuan, respectively. The Joint Reserve Bank notes fell sharply again by 2 jiao, with buying and selling prices at 3.6 yuan and 3.7 jiao, respectively. This is due to the decline in the Tianjin-Shanghai exchange rate.</p>
<h3>Mixed Performance of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai stock market still had a few trades done secretly among the industry, but the transaction was sparse. From the close today, the annual holiday will also be processed, and trading will be suspended. The situation is still in the sell-off of seeking real goods, but those with capital choose to absorb the better ones. The World Book Company and the Five Continents Pharmacy are quite strong. Public utilities are the weakest, and department store stocks and new drug stocks are also mostly sluggish. The unofficial dark market price is actually controlled by those who are still in business, and the commission is pressed after accepting the commission of the households. Therefore, the stock prices of each stock market are mixed up and down in chaos. The highest and lowest market prices for trading are listed below:</p>
<h3>Tax Increase Imminent - Piece Goods Optimistic</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to the imminent tax increase on yarn and cloth, the cloth market was more popular, and the shouting price was slightly higher, but there were very few sales, because the industry was optimistic. 12-pound Dapeng fine cloth was sold for over 197.5 yuan, and it continued to be good for 1.5 yuan. The factory price of 12-pound Earth fine cloth opened in the morning at 196 yuan, and there was no supply in the afternoon. Peach Lady Lin rose to 322 yuan, and Chickens also needed 321.5 yuan. Dongpi Four Gentlemen Serge red list has risen from 8.1 yuan to 8.2 yuan, an increase of 1 jiao.</p>
<h3>Woolen Industry Busy with Inventory</h3>
<p>Woolen sales were negligible due to the end of the year, except for a few odds and ends for urgent needs. However, since the abolition of small transportation, large transportation orders have not been issued, and there is no way to transport and deliver them, which is also a reason. Many businesses in the industry are inspecting their inventories and closing their accounts to calculate their profits and losses for the whole year. The association is busy finding the income tax from last month's micro-collection. There are many fewer peddlers and brokers in the market than in the past. Observing that the price of goods is still very firm, and the air of spring and summer goods is even tighter, this is because the bottom of the woolen goods is gradually lacking.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou New Peanuts on the Market</h3>
<p>Price per bag is 500 yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the miscellaneous grain market was quite soft, because the National New Year is approaching, and both the firms are preparing to close their accounts, so there were not many transactions. The market is still trending firm due to the insufficient supply. Yangzhou peanuts and peanut kernels were shipped to Shanghai in the first batch. The price of peanut kernels was 735 yuan, and 100 bags were traded. 20 bags of peanuts were sold at a price of 500 yuan. 50 bags of Chongming sandy red beans were sold at a price of 343 yuan to 345 yuan. Another 560 bags of sandy soybeans were sold at a price of 330 yuan to 338 yuan. One cart of Yuanlong cakes was sold at a price of 83.75 yuan, and 50 sheets of Fei Zi cake were sold at a price of 84.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Longkou Vermicelli - Winter Sales Still Good</h3>
<p>Longkou vermicelli has been trending steady recently, with good winter sales. The opening price of new Longkou vermicelli was 1,1780 yuan, the upper range of old goods was 1,100 yuan, and the next range was 1,050 yuan. The current market price for new goods is 1,200 yuan, which has not yet been traded.</p>
<h3>Yantai Shrimp Tails - Source Continuous</h3>
<p>Yantai shrimp tails are arriving continuously, and sales are also quite lively. The current market price for large golden hooks is 5,000 yuan, medium hooks are 4,500 yuan, and small hooks are 3,700 yuan, which are hot and stable.</p>
<h3>British and American Cigarettes - Sales Active</h3>
<p>Selling prices rise again, Japanese cigarettes remain stable</p>
<p>In the cigarette market, British and American goods are actively selling for domestic consumption, in preparation for the New Year's door sales, which has led to a general price support from cargo owners, so prices have risen. However, Japanese and domestic cigarettes remain stable. The price of British cigarettes is 9,450 yuan for Brand 9, 8,450 yuan for Old Knife Brand, 7,700 yuan for Pin Hai Brand, 6,200 yuan for Wu Hua, and 7,400 yuan for Fairy Brand. The price of Japanese cigarettes is 2,850 yuan for Gold Gun Brand, 3,300 yuan for Golden Building, 2,700 yuan for Red Rose, 2,950 yuan for Quanlu Brand, and 2,400 yuan for Guide Brand. The price of domestic cigarettes is 6,350 yuan for Pyramid, 5,600 yuan for Beauty Brand, and 3,700 yuan for Golden Mouse Brand, which are more or less stable compared to the previous day's prices.</p>
<h3>Soap and Candles Scarce - Selling Prices Rise Repeatedly</h3>
<p>Matches Rationed, Market Remains Mediocre</p>
<p>There are very few transactions for soap, and it is quite difficult to sell in large quantities. Handlers see that the inventory is scarce and are waiting and watching, resulting in a market with prices but no transactions. If there is a transaction, the price is determined by the number of buyers. The current price is 510 yuan per box for Gu Ben soap, 480 yuan for Bai Xiangmao soap, 415 yuan for Huang Xiangmao soap, and Scissors soap.</p>
<p>Match transactions are generally not very active among囤户 (Túnhù; Speculators, or hoarding households), and the actual sales market is generally sufficient because the rations are sufficient, so there are few transactions among the industry. The price of Phoenix Brand is still 3,000 yuan, Beauty Brand is 3,200 yuan, Golden Tripod Brand is 2,800 yuan, and Miscellaneous Brand is 2,350 yuan.</p>
<p>Candles are becoming increasingly scarce, so it is difficult to buy both odds and ends and whole boxes. Those who have a little inventory are becoming increasingly scarce, and the shouting price is rising step by step. The price of White Lee's Ship Brand is 420 yuan, the Price of clown hat brand is 360 yuan, Eagle Brand is 400 yuan, and Miscellaneous Brand is 250 yuan.</p>
<h3>Lackluster Tea Sales</h3>
<p>Since the holiday ended on the 25th, the tea market has seen some trading activity. However, only about 20 dan of red and green tea were traded throughout the city. These were purchased by Ding Jintai Tea House, including approximately 13 dan of red tea priced at 640 yuan. The remaining 7 dan were green tea, sold by Maoji Tea Shop for 550 yuan.</p>
<h3>Bagua Dan Sales Still Active</h3>
<p>Volatile Price Fluctuations</p>
<p>In the medicine market, items like Bagua Dan are still selling steadily, but the prices fluctuate quite a bit. Other transactions are sporadic, and prices generally seem stable. Headache powder is priced at 7 yuan, Wan Jin Oil at 31.5 yuan, Bagua Dan at 6 yuan, Partridge Vegetable at 56.5 yuan, Longhu Rendan at 2.5 yuan, and Invincible Tooth Powder at 11.5 yuan.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Sympathy</h3>
<p>— Mingyue</p>
<p>On a public vehicle, a passenger said to another passenger that he was walking on the road last night, the weather was very cold, and he saw a beggar stripping the clothes off a dying beggar and putting them on himself. The passenger said with great emotion: "People who are utterly impoverished must have numb nerves and no sympathy at all."</p>
<p>After hearing this, a tragic scene of a beggar stripping clothes appeared in my mind like a newsreel.</p>
<p>Yes, in the eyes of "gentlemen," this scene will inevitably provoke a complaint, saying: If they could have saved and spent less and deposited more money in the bank, how could they have become beggars? These two beggars must be lazy and not striving. They deserve it! They deserve it!</p>
<p>The social situation is very complex, especially in this unprecedented era of great upheaval. There are many reasons for becoming a beggar, and the tragic history experienced cannot be fully explained in a few words. Let's not delve into that. The question that lingers in my mind is: "Do people who are utterly impoverished have no sympathy at all?"</p>
<p>Mencius said: "The heart of compassion is inherent in everyone." Benjamin Franklin said: "The poor are more generous than the rich."</p>
<p>My guess is that the beggar stripping the clothes off the dying beggar was actually an extremely cowardly act. (Indeed, this act is terrible.) Because stripping the clothes of a passerby would lead to legal trouble, while stripping the clothes of a dying beggar would not be subject to any interference. This is a tragic history of human hell and probably has nothing to do with sympathy.</p>
<p>Generally, unscrupulous merchants and speculators hoard and manipulate goods, raising prices sky-high. A small number of them have indeed become millionaires. However, many people who could have avoided becoming beggars are now overwhelmed by high prices and reduced to beggary. The few who become rich through unscrupulous means indulge in extravagant pleasures. If they were willing to exploit or waste just one percent or one-thousandth less, they could save many lives. However, they would rather spend thousands of gold pieces on entertainment and pleasure than show even a little sympathy. So, where is the sympathy of the rich?</p>
<p>"Being rich" and "being benevolent" are by no means neighbors. A few clever rich people occasionally perform small acts of kindness, but these are just means to "become rich" and gain fame. From a purely moral standpoint, they are already questionable. However, this is already too much to expect from the rich!</p>
<h3>Supplement to Street Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Gao Xiufu</p>
<p>On December 28th, Mr. Ren Yin refuted Mr. Baihong's street anecdote of the 23rd regarding the location of Lu Xun's tomb. The research is thorough and admirable. Furthermore, Mr. Baihong mentioned road names in Shanghai. Besides Zhu Bao San Road and Yu Qiaqing Road, only Lin Gui Road is named after a Chinese person. This is indeed true. As far as I know, there is another road whose Chinese name is often overlooked, namely Shanzhong Road. According to Tao Ruzeng, whose courtesy name was Shanzhong, a native of Gujia Road in Chuansha County on the left bank of the Huangpu River, he was involved in horse breeding. During the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods, he established a horse carriage company. The business was very prosperous. He acquired a lot of real estate in that area. Mr. Tao was also enthusiastic about charity and made many contributions to public welfare in the local area and his hometown. The French Concession Public Works Department named the road after him. This is detailed in the Chuansha County Annals.</p>
<h3>Organizing Small Loans for Common People</h3>
<p>— Han Rui</p>
<p>Currently, except for a few wealthy people, everyone feels that life is difficult. It's like living in a city of sorrow, living each day as it comes. In particular, unemployed common people are the most affected, some of whom have been laid off due to the closure of companies and shops; others have been squeezed out amidst cost-cutting measures. They have no power to find a place to stay; they have no money to do business and make money. Under these circumstances, unemployed common people are the most miserable.</p>
<p>Can we remain indifferent to the suffering of these unemployed common people? No, we should, in the spirit of human "mutual assistance," provide them with possible assistance. I hope that wealthy people in society will take on this urgent and meaningful task of helping unemployed common people.</p>
<p>There are two ways to help unemployed common people: one is to organize employment agencies, and the other is to provide small loans. The former is already being done by the Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Public Works Bureau through its employment agency for unemployed skilled workers. The latter was previously done by the News Society's small loan program. Recently, Jin Yuan Qianzhuang in Ruyi Lane on Henan Road has also started providing small loans for common people.</p>
<p>Besides helping people find jobs, I believe that the best way to solve unemployment is indeed to organize small loans for common people. This is significant for three reasons: (1) Many common people who have lost their jobs are discouraged and disoriented. Under economic pressure, they are forced to take risks or commit suicide, which has a significant impact on social security. Loans give them a path of hope and strengthen the confidence of the unemployed. (2) Giving a few coins to pitiful people on the street may stem from compassion, but it may also lead them to become self-abandoning and rely solely on others for help, fostering a habit of dependence. Loans can enable common people to be self-reliant and inspire them to become self-sufficient. (3) If unemployed common people can use the borrowed funds wisely and earn some profit, they may be able to resolve part or all of their family's financial burden.</p>
<p>As far as I know, since Jin Yuan Qianzhuang announced the availability of small loans, applications have been quite enthusiastic. The first batch of investigations has been completed, and disbursements will be made soon. I urge wealthy individuals throughout Shanghai to follow suit, expand the scope of the program, and enable many unemployed common people wandering the streets to escape the suffering of hunger and cold and have the opportunity to support themselves.

<h3>Sharing the Same Boat in the Storm</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>One or Two: Back Garden Flowers</p>
<p>Wei Cheng lived in the mill. The wound had healed, all the way until the Lantern Festival, when Madam Li Youxie found out. So she urged Wei Cheng to go back. Wei Cheng thought that living to this point, there was simply no right way to go, except to go back and reflect behind closed doors. There was no other proper way. On a bright moonlit night, Li Youxie sent someone to send Wei Cheng back. The second wife Ye was both surprised and happy, as was Cui Zhen. They asked where Huang Long was. Wei Cheng said, "Aunt, being outside, it was like a spring dream. Now the dream has woken up. From now on, I will always close the door and not think about anything. Please forgive me, Aunt. Don't ask me those things I said when I was reckless, and don't ask me the things I don't want to answer." The second wife Ye saw that Wei Cheng looked okay and didn't pursue the matter further. Every day, she made some delicious dishes for him to eat. When people came to see Wei Cheng, she only said that he had gone to Suzhou to study and was not at home. Wei Cheng always kept the door of Shuangmei Study closed. He would kneel for a long time in front of the portraits of his father, Lord Aitang, and his mother, Lady Li, muttering to himself, often for half an hour or an hour without standing up. From the New Year to late spring, from late spring to high summer, the big trees surrounding Shide Hall were green and lush again. He</p>
<p>During this time, things improved. Fei Changhe hadn't come to the Ye family to harass Xiao Qing for a long time. Neither the second wife Ye nor Cui Zhen had any illnesses. And those whom Wei Cheng had been concerned about in the past, like his only confidant Huang Long, and Chen Yourong's children, Guoqi and Guofang, who were avenging his father's death, had no news. In the blink of an eye, it was early August in the Western calendar. Wei Cheng had been living at home, isolated and ignorant, for more than half a year, and he was extremely bored and frustrated. He couldn't help but feel the urge to move. He had returned on a bright moonlit night, and now he wanted to take advantage of the moonlight to go for a stroll. He locked the door and walked away, only to hear a burst of soft music. Someone was singing the song "Back Garden Flowers," followed by loud laughter. He was afraid that his family would notice, so he rushed back home with a sad mood. Sure enough, A Xing had already gone to the back to ask, "Who opened the door and went out?" Wei Cheng hurriedly responded, "It's me, A Xing. In the village ahead, someone is singing. Who are they?" A Xing said, "Young master doesn't know. Someone is putting on a dance troupe, preparing to go to Shanghai to make money." Wei Cheng sighed deeply. (257)</p>

<h3>Gleanings from Tibetan Politics</h3>
<p>— Baihong</p>
<p>Tibet has always been known as a secret country and has long been coveted by the British. Its western and southern regions border India, and British-controlled Bhutan and Nepal. Its northern and eastern regions are adjacent to Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Xikang. With the situation in West Asia tense and India becoming an important international player, neighboring Tibet will naturally be given more attention. My friend, Mr. Wu, who previously worked for the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission for many years, is familiar with Tibetan affairs and has repeatedly sent me sporadic letters. I am now presenting them to readers for their enjoyment.</p>
<p>(1) Starting with the Panchen Lama and the Dalai Lama:</p>
<p>Panchen and Dalai are originally titles of respect for the Dharma King by the Tibetans, and not personal names (both the Panchen Lama and the Dalai Lama have their own real names, as will be detailed later). Both are great disciples of the Yellow Sect founder Tsongkhapa, and their mantle is passed down through generations. The Dalai Lama resides in the Potala Palace in Lhasa, Tibet, and has been passed down to the thirteenth generation. The Panchen Lama resides in the Tashilhunpo Monastery in Shigatse, Tibet, and has been passed down to the ninth generation. Dalai originally means "ocean" in Mongolian, symbolizing that blessings and wisdom are as vast as the ocean. In Tibetan, it also means the ruler with the highest power. Panchen is an abbreviation of the Sanskrit word "Pandita," a respectful term for scholars, meaning learned and capable, vast and unparalleled. The Dalai Lama's position is naturally higher than that of the Panchen Lama.</p>
<p>(2) A Review of the Separation and Combination of Politics and Religion:</p>
<p>According to Tibetan history, before the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty, it was originally the era of the Red Sect. Politics and religion were separate. Political power was governed by the king, while religious power was held by the Dharma King. After Tsongkhapa initiated the religious revolution and spread the Yellow Sect and passed away, he left a will to his two great disciples, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama, who would reincarnate in future lives. At that time, the first Dalai Lama, Gendun Drup, was the son of the king. He abandoned the throne, became a monk, and received the precepts. Therefore, he had a dual qualification. He was both the Dharma King and the Tibetan King. This was the beginning of the unification of politics and religion. However, there were often separations and combinations thereafter, largely depending on the talent and ability of each Dalai Lama.</p>
<p>(3) The Actual Political Organization</p>
<p>The highest administrative organ in Tibet is the "Kashag," which translates directly to "Administrative Hall." Its nature is similar to the cabinet of a cabinet system, composed of four "Kalons," who are responsible for all legislative, judicial, and administrative powers in Tibet. They carry out the Dalai Lama's orders and exercise power through a collegial system. "Kalon" translates to "high-ranking political officer," and their nature is similar to that of ministers in a cabinet system. There are typically three secular officials and one monk. They organize meetings and exercise all political power. The method of their selection is that they are appointed by the Dalai Lama, without a fixed term. Between the Dalai Lama and the Kalons, there is also a "Silon," which translates to "Political Minister." Its nature is to connect the top and bottom. However, it has no power to change the decisions of the Kashag. It assists the Dalai Lama in handling administrative affairs on a daily basis, similar to the prime minister in a cabinet system. This position is usually filled by a secular person. The method of its selection originally required the election of major Hutuktus (a respectful term for lamas, also called Living Buddhas). Recently, it has been changed to be appointed by the Dalai Lama and is often a relative of his family.</p>
<p>(4) The Former Dalai Lama and the Former Panchen Lama</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama has been passed down to the thirteenth generation, and the Panchen Lama has also been passed down to the ninth generation. The thirteenth Dalai Lama's name was "Ngawang Lobsang Thupten Gyatso," and he reincarnated in the second year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. When British troops entered Tibet in the past, he fled to the interior and once came to Beijing. He was quite capable. Later, he dismissed the Tibetan King "Dingjie Delinmu" and appointed his cousin "Yaoqi Lengqing" as the Silon. All political, military, and religious powers in Tibet were under his control. He passed away in Tibet in 1933.</p>
<p>The ninth Panchen Lama's name was "Losang Chökyi Gyaltsen," and he reincarnated in the ninth year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. Because of his discord with the Dalai Lama, he left Tibet for the interior in 1924. Later, he was recruited by the National Government, and in 1934, he was appointed as a member of the National Government and the Pacification Commissioner of the Western Border. He resided in Beijing, Nanjing, and Shanghai. Later, he went west to Inner Mongolia and Qinghai. In the winter of 1937, he also passed away from illness in the Yushu residence in Qinghai.</p>
<p>(5) The Current Acting Ruler, Jize Rezhen:</p>
<p>In Tibetan, "Jize" means "acting ruler." Rezhen is a personal name. It is customary in Tibet that after the death of an old Dalai Lama, before a new Dalai Lama is reincarnated, the people elect a wise and capable Hutuktu to act as his representative. Rezhen was elected to be the acting ruler after the thirteenth Dalai Lama passed away. He is from Qinghai, has talent and courage. In the summer of 1939, he dismissed Silon Yaoqi Lengqing. He is currently the highest authority in Tibet.</p>
<p>(6) The Young Dalai Lama and the Young Panchen Lama</p>
<p>According to custom, after the death of an old Dalai Lama, people should be sent to search for a reincarnation. Lots should be drawn to decide. However, the thirteenth Dalai Lama passed away in 1933, and it was not until February 22, 1940, that the enthronement ceremony was held in Lhasa. The Chongqing government sent Wu Zhongxin, chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, to attend. The fourteenth Dalai Lama's name is "Lhamo Dhondrub," and he was six years old at the time. He was born in Qijiachuan, Gongbeng, Xining, Qinghai. Two of his brothers are young Living Buddhas in the Kumbum Monastery. At the same time, a reincarnation was also found in Biru, one of the thirty-nine tribes of Xikang, and another in Menzhuling, Shannan, Tibet. However, because Rezhen's divination, sea gazing, and the instructions of the Dharma protector all matched Lhamo Dhondrub, and he was recognized by a joint assembly of monks and laypeople as the reincarnation of the thirteenth Dalai Lama, the lottery procedure was not held. The Chongqing government also confirmed this with a clear order.</p>
<p>As for the tenth Panchen Lama, according to news from Kangding last year, the Panchen Lama's residence in Ganzi sent people to search for the reincarnation. They had already divided into two routes, north and south, to investigate. In early July, they found a reincarnation in Zhuosang, Lihua County, named "Loten Dorje." He is a resident of Zheduotang in Kangding and was born on November 2nd of the old lunar calendar of 1938. He has been welcomed to Zhousang Hui La Temple. The outcome is still unknown. In fact, the Panchen Lama's situation in Tibet is nothing more than a symbolic offering.</p>
