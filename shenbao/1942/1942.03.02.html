<h3 id="c25">華維爾論將才（八） <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>部下値得稱讚的地方應毫不吝惜的在口頭或書面將其表揚。他應該盡量的多與部下接觸，使其發生良好的印象。繁文縟節也自有它的用處，對部下決不可以用譏誚的口吻；這樣的弄小聰明旣損人不利己且必激人惱怒。處處應該說老實話，除非是必須嚴守秘密的，如作戰計劃等等。在上次大戰中最使兵士不快的，是情報部宣傳德軍士氣頹喪不力的印刷品，因為他們在前綫明明知道德國兵的戰鬥力依舊十分頑强啊！</p>
<p>總之，將領和部下的關係極似騎者和馬匹的關係。馬匹不特須加以管束訓練，亦須與以鼓勵；一句獵者的老格言說：「在廐中飼養，好像價値五百鎊；在跨下馳騁，好像不値半文錢。」由馬自身的舒適與否，它不但知道騎者技術是否精良，也知道騎者是勇敢的還是怯懦的，果斷的還是躇躊的。一個將領有時必須驅使士卒，有如御馬一般；而名騎師與馬主也不定是最喜歡馬匹的人。一個將領有方法可以使上級的人相信他，當他是一個好司令官；但是非有眞本領，不能使部下說他是好司令官令官。</p>
<p>三·將領與政治家</p>
<p>這一次我要講高級指揮官和上司的關係了，所謂上司便是指領導戰事的政治家，這又是一個議論紛紜不易解決的問題。諸君想必部知道，上次大戰中英國將領與政治家問的關係很是不和合。一般說來，政治家總怪將領眼先淺狹，抱着軍人的偏見，而將領呢，動輒把許多困難歸咎於「政治的干涉。」這種政治與軍事間的磨擦，比較起來還是一個新的戰時問題，這是民主的，不是專制的特徵。</p>
<p>古時候，政治與軍事間的爭端極少，實際上軍人和政治家往往無分彼此，讀過希臘古史的，想必都知道雅典與斯巴達的伯羅奔尼撒戰役。關於那次戰役，有這樣一個故事，講到雅典的克利盎和尼細阿斯，當時，克利盎是反對黨的領袖，對保守的尼細阿斯屢有非議。尼細阿斯想杜絕其政敵的攻擊，便反脣相譏，說道：一好，那麽讓你去號令三軍，看你是否能够做得好些。」不料克利盎竟然答應下來，而目起兵打了一次幸運的大勝仗。這事對於尼細阿斯固然不幸，對於雅典後來到底也沒有好結果，在古代的羅馬，軍事長官必須先充任過各級的行政長官。將領有缺額時，就由行政長官中選拔出來，馬可萊在「詠古羅馬詩」中描寫該城遭遇非常事變時，共父老有極賢明的措置：當危急存亡之秋，莫好有人攬權。就讓我們來舉個狄克推多，人人都得聽命。給他做六個月的狄克推多，到期不准展延，號稱騎士之雄，執斧鉞二十四柄。這樣辦法不是很簡單嗎？假使現代的狄克推多仍舊有這樣的任期限制，恐怕歐洲要平靜得多了。</p>
<p>在最早的民治國中，一個將領的計劃，因政治上的疏忽，致成畫餅，漢尼拔的歷史可以作第一個明證。許多年來，國家的君主往往親自統率軍隊出征（例如，亞歷山大，從前的許多英王，考斯道夫二世等），自然不會發生政治干涉的問題。馬爾巳羅的地位頗為奇特，除任陸軍總司令外，實際上無異是外相，國家的外交政策都在他的司令部內決定。當其全盛之時，在國內政治上也握有與首相相當的權力。但是因荷蘭政治家的干涉，和國內政敵的仇視，其計劃仍屢遭破壞，這恐怕也不是別的將領所經着過的。對這一切，他都能沉着應付，有如在戰塲上所表現的一樣。雖則有許多過失，他眞是一個偉大人物；而且據我看來，無疑是英國最偉大的軍事天才。</p>
<p>干政的將領向來為英國軍事傳統所咒詛，但是大多數英國的名將都有政治上的經歷。克倫威爾在未常軍人之前，曾任國會議員有年。我們剛才說過的馬爾巴羅，在開始戎馬生涯時，其政治陰謀的鏗騐遠比軍事經騐豐富。威靈頓曾任愛爾蘭及英國國會議員。穆爾與克牢福特都曾出席議院；巴羅薩的勝利者格累姆（後為林恩陶煦勳爵）亦是如此，其首次掌握軍權時，已經四十四歲了。反過來，在法國大革命戰爭中，我們看見政治委員常常阻礙軍事工作。竿到拿破崙自舉為狄克批多，其任期不是六個月而是籠統的「在此期間」，上述現象方才消滅。</p>
<p>我在戰史上東西搜索無殊於獵犬追逐島　，所以下一個例子是講美國的南北戰爭。偉大聰明的林肯與共手下將領間的關係實在値得我們來硏究一下。他在幾經試騐之後，找到了一個可以信託的將領，就聽其指揮作戰不加絲毫牽制。這將領便是格蘭脫。下面聽我讀一段林肯給其將官的信，他的性格我想即可由此看出來了。</p>

<p>著名經濟學家安翰能氏、昨在英文大美晚報發表一文、據謂本埠與日方勢力圈內之南洋、頗有早日恢復買易關係之可能、此種可能當為本埠工業界人士所極關心者、蓋以往兩年內南洋各國曾為本埠工業產品大主顧也、</p>
<p>滬港南洋貿易趨勢</p>
<p>其中香港一地、尤為最大之主顧、去歲本埠貨物之運往香港者、共値四萬萬元以上、約佔上海出口總値之什二、惟香港本為轉運中心、故自本埠運往之貨物、泰半均轉運他處、或往東南亞各地、或往歐美、是以上海運港之出口買易、僅小部可歸入南洋貿易、據查上海貿易之統計數字、則太平洋戰前數月內、輸往香港·馬來亞·菲列賓·荷印及越南秦國之貨物、平均每月約値五千萬元、約佔本埠出口額之什二、</p>
<p>棉貨禁令或將撤銷</p>
<p>而本埠輸往南洋之貨物、原先以械貨佔過半數、自棉貨禁止出口後、即完全停運、於未禁運運前、棉紗棉織品之出口、約佔上海對越南荷印輸出之什七、對菲列賓馬來亞之什六、及對泰國香港之什五以上、此因歐戰起後、南洋各地均不能取得歐西之供給、轉而仰給於上海故也、一旦南洋貿易恢復、則該處一帶仍不失為木埠棉織業之重要巿塲、而棉貨出口之禁令、或將撤銷、</p>
<p>上海工業獲新活力</p>
<p>本埠其他工業於前數年內、亦曾於南洋一帶拓有重要市塲、本埠運往荷創之貨物、包括大量之玻璃與玻器皿、搪瓷之鐵器及醫藥品等、輸往秦國者、以棉織品草　藥品電燈泡玻璃等為大宗、新加坡則需玻璃化學品鐵器等、而菲列賓乃電氣用具搪瓷器皿鐵器等之大主顧、尙有多種食物、運銷南洋各地、以是觀之、南洋貿易之恢復、範圍即使有限、或可使上海工業獲得新活力、而本埠之經濟局面、亦可因而多所改進云、</p>

<p>融五講經社第三十四期講經，國學講座第四期，沈覺靈君講古本大學第一段，其提要云，大學四在宇，揭示道之所在，不假他求。親民，朱子四　本作新民，以第二段有苟日新，日日新，又日新，作新民諸語，義亦可通；然證以君子賢其賢而親其親，小人樂其樂而利其利二語，自以親民為長，目不先親民，民亦無山新也。止於至善及知止而后有定一節，與佛學止觀及定靜　之恉一貫。知所先後，則近道語。開下二節意。格物之說，自鄭康成以後，有七十餘家，不外維心維物二派，實則今之所謂科學，凡物理學，化學，生物學，（包動物植物）礦物學任何一目，吿可備格物一義。我國高　治平，於在格物之在字，不甚注意，缺乏初步工作，遂致文化落後，西國專注重於此，突飛猛進，又忽於治平之觀念，遂演成殺人之利器，釀成兩次戰禍。可見專重維心與專重維物，均有流弊。孔子之言，至為渾融。大學六段，均以此謂結束，此謂知本此謂知之至也二語，實根修身為本語而來。四害木為之袖傳，易以此謂物格，致多出此謂知本一語，不免為竄改古害之笑柄。</p>
<p>楊中一君講孔子不限儒敎，第一儒（儒之誼）儒，說文「柔也，術士之稱。」柔者，君子難進易退，老氏知雄守雌，惟天下之至柔，乃能馳騁天下之至剛。術者，儒行「營道同術，」晏子「術有條理，」漢宣紀「修文學經術，」相如傳顏注「凡有道術吿為儒，」鄭注周禮太宰「儒以道得民」曰「儒？諸侯保氏有六藝以敎民者。」注大司徒曰，「師儒，鄕里敎以道藝者。」注禮記目錄云：「以其記有道德者所行。」按論語「君子學以致其道，」是古時道術為士君子之學，盡力于道術而得其全者，法言君子「通天地人之謂儒，是也。</p>
<p>儒之分　論語言儒，唯雍也記「君子儒小人儒」之辨而孔子未嘗自承為儒也。孟子言儒，唯盡心「墨必歸于，楊逃楊必歸于儒講」頭分三派。儒雖聖人之徒，而孟子亦未嘗自承為儒。所述聖之淸任和者，皆不限以儒，何况孔子聖之時者乎？至荀子儒效，乃有「俗人，俗儒，雅儒，大儒，」又「大儒，小儒衆人，」之別，始自居于儒。而以周公仲尼子弓為大儒，且賤無異墨于之俗儒。非十二子篇分為六派，而以仲尼，子弓總之，是不與六派並也。其徒韓非遂謂「世之顯學儒墨，儒之所至孔丘，墨之所至墨翟，」「八儒三墨，竟以中分天下。（孔子不必儒）尸子廣澤篇叙六子之貴，有「孔子貴公，」並舉爾雅釋詁之文曰一十有餘名而實一也。」呂覽不二篇叙十子之貴，有「孔子貴仁，一而曰「能齊萬不同，如出于一者，其唯聖人矣乎、皆不言孔子貴儒。（孔子不限儒家）莊子徐無鬼「儒墨楊秉與惠為五，」天下篇分六派而儒不與焉。並推本各家之淵源於一貫之道，曰「聖有所生，王有所成，皆原於一。」「古之人其備乎，配神明，醇天地，育萬物，和天下，澤及百姓，六通四辟，小大精粗，其運無乎不在。」「其在於詩書禮樂者，鄒魯之士，縉紳先生多能明之。」「其數散於天下而設於中國者，百家之學時，或稱而道之。」此何人邪？非內聖外王，生命未有之孔子邪？又曰，「天下大亂，賢聖不明，」「一曲之士，不能相通，」「故內聖外王之道闇而不明，鬱而不發，天下之人各自為其所欲焉以自為方。後之學者不幸不見天地之純，古人之大體，道術將為天下裂。」孔子之道術裂而後有百家之方術，莊予知孔子不以儒限也。</p>
<p>儒者　淮南要略分八派，曰「道則無不在焉，而能得本知末者，其唯聖人也。」「孔子修成康之道，述周公之訓，以敎七十子，儒者之學生焉。」始以儒者名。史談論六家要旨，道法名皆稱家，而儒墨稱者，曰「儒者博而寡要，勞而少功，事難盡從，」則非世家贊「景行低回，折中至聖」之孔子可知。</p>
<p>儒家　漢善藝文志叙九流，始以「儒家」各，而曰，「祖述蕘舜，憲章文武，宗師仲尼，」則孔子上繼堯舜文武，而不限於儒可知。隋書經籍志叙儒曰，「仲尼祖述前代，修正六經，三千之徒並受其義。至於戰國，子思，孟軻，荀卿之流宗而師之。」則儒之為名，最早亦在三千之後，戰國之世，出於荀况之自號。孔子者，其所宗師，而不限於儒，亦猶堯舜文武周公，與伊尹夷惠之不限於儒，一也。且曰「非禹之道，不足為墨，」而禹非墨家。即曰「非孔之道，不足為儒，」而孔亦不限儒家可知。若儒所崇亦必儒，則木匠祀魯般，髮匠奉關公，將何以處二人。</p>
<p>儒說　左傳哀二十一「唯其儒書，」史記田蚡傳「務隆儒術，」河間世家「王好儒學，」叔孫通傳「卒為儒宗。」</p>
<p>儒行　禮記儒行篇記孔子對哀公問儒十七條。儒有云云，不過一體之得爾，後世乃誤認孔子為儒家。陳　集說引李氏曰，「儒行非孔子之言，戰國豪士所以高世之節，多自夸大，以謠其君，此豈所謂孔子者哉？」</p>

<h3 id="c48">地獄搜奇紀 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— 杜亞聲</p>
<p>讀者諸君，今年就要吿訴眾多們一個生平未消　有之奇遇，不過你們不要看了題目而以為我眞的遇見了什麽鬼之類，那是「舞台與銀幕」上的玩意兒，靑天白日，朗朗乾坤，余未之見也。這里的所謂「地獄」是租界邊緣的一個小客棧，我徘徊在那陰黯的賬房（其實祇有一隻賬台）一角，約二十餘分鐘，所見所聞，它將深深烙印在我的記憶中。就是你，諸位先生，假如有機會去走一遭，我想，誰都不會忘了這未有之奇遇的。</p>
<p>我有一個遠房親戚，被他的家族登報驅逐的，其「不肖」的程度也可想見了。最近他家里接到他的悔過信，願意歸家重新做人，不過這種「海誓山盟」也已經不是一次了，自然相應不理。他的母親却愛子心切，暗中常託人照他信上的地址去探訪，上一個星期，也把這件事託付了我。</p>
<p>關於這位流浪者的罪行，我也聽得够了，不過總希望他能一旦豁然開朗，立地成佛，於是按着地址走一遭了。</p>
<p>這種小客棧，或許同曹禺寫「日出」而去過那種「鵝毛舖」相同。我找到了一位所謂賬房先生，告訴他我所要尋訪的人</p>
<p>在僅有的一盞煤油燈光綫中，那賬房先生細細打量着我的身份，是懷疑，是恐懼，我不知道。</p>
<p>最後他給我一個不屑的回答：「這里祇有阿毛阿狗，沒有×××先生的！」</p>
<p>這使我無法應付了，因為我不知道我的親戚是否有一個「阿×」的雅篆。</p>
<p>這時候從黑暗中竄出一個人影來，是一個十五六歲的孩子，看他走路說話以及一切舉動，他的生活經騐或許比馬相伯先生更豐富。他先也是向我打量了一番，才慢慢地問我：「是找×××嗎？」</p>
<p>「是的。小弟弟。我覺得這孩子很可愛。</p>
<p>「早不在這見了。」</p>
<p>那位賬　　主忽然也若有所悟，接口了：小狗，是小馬嗎？」</p>
<p>我的親戚是姓馬，叫一小馬一自然比「馬××」便利而爽快得多。</p>
<p>「是小馬。」我發現了一綫光明之後，不能放過機會，迫着那小孩子問：「能不能吿訴我他到什麼地方去了？」</p>
<p>「到南巿去了，已經一個月了呵！」說罷，手指向賬房先生一觸，「翻翻賬簿看，小馬那一天走的？」</p>
<p>「哼！」賬房有些氣憤，「除了辦公事，翻賬簿才倒霉呢！」</p>
<p>這似乎提靦了小狗，向我投了鄙視的一眼，「是不是眞的找小馬？」</p>
<p>我也有些氣憤，繼而自作聰明起來，問：「小馬欠了房錢嗎？」</p>
<p>「欠房錢？」那小孩子高聲大笑浩，拍拍我的肩胛，像小學敎師上講堂似的，「先生，這是什麽所在，沒有錢就休想睡到屋子里來！」說着，從耳朶後面揀出半截烟尾來，一面向賬房討火柴。</p>
<p>「你也吸烟嗎？」我問他。</p>
<p>「你有烟嗎？」他反問我，「給我一枝！」</p>
<p>我給了他一枝烟，也授給賬房一枝，不料就在這一枝烟上使賬房先生高興起來，一而稱謝，一面自動地去翻一冊破舊的賬簿，我乘便看了一眼，上面不知塗着些什麽記號。半響，他吿訴我小馬是什麽時候走的，並且扭了一下小狗的耳朶，聲斥着：「小赤老，你同他一天走的，你們到什麽地方一去的？」</p>
<p>「南市！」</p>
<p>「到南巿去什麽？」我搶着問。</p>
<p>「做賣買！」</p>
<p>賑房先生點點頭，說：「你自己不動嗎？」</p>
<p>孩子也點點頭，似乎非常難過的樣子。</p>
<p>我雖非老上海，這一點「切口」還懂得，就問他「大賣買還是小賣買？」</p>
<p>「沒有什麽大不了，搶大餅。」</p>
<p>說這話的時候，他顯得非常不安，我知道他說慌，不過也可見這孩子的天性未泯，我就厲聲責問，「不許說慌，說老實話！」我把袋里的一包烟投給他。</p>
<p>一半是我的聲音壓服了他，十半是那包香烟也同時發生了效力，他向我一笑，那確是天眞的笑，「搶烟紙店失了風，不過也就會出來的。」</p>
<p>「小鬼，勿寫意，怪不得…………」賬房先生向他吐了一口唾沫。</p>
<p>「我是不來的，」他急急聲辯，「是他搶了鈔票還想拿香烟。」</p>
<p>我拍拍他的頭，問他：「讀過書嗎？」</p>
<p>「讀過書。」</p>
<p>「再想讀書嗎？」</p>
<p>他沒有回答，但立即搖搖頭。</p>
<p>我給了他五塊錢，「如果小馬出來，你招呼他住在這里，我再會來看你們的。」</p>
<p>他把鈔票摺小了，向褲腰里塞，伸出手來時握着另外一張紙，向我一揚，「先生，是一件馬褲呢大衣的當票，你要嗎？」</p>
<p>我想笑，但是笑不出來，我說：「我穿西裝的。」「你可以贖出來再賣，祇當五十塊錢呢。」</p>
<p>「你為什麼不把當票賣了？」</p>
<p>「一塊錢五分，五五二塊五角，我不賣！」</p>
<p>踏出這家小客棧時，迎面碰見一惆很面熟的人往里走，孩子推推我的手，「認識他嗎？是唱滑稽的×××，從前紅得很！」</p>
<p>我點點頭，沒有話可說，看着他向鐵門那邊走去，再回頭向小客棧投了最後之一瞥，里面祇是黑漆一團。</p>

<p>相聲原為一種口技，相謂像也，以一人之口，學各種聲音以像之也。此種單純口技，淸初即已盛行，祗一人坐於慕後為之。惟今北方所謂相聲，已非如此之單純矣；於像聲之外，叉有說唱逗三者：說為說笑話，唱為唱小曲，逗則二人以滑稽之口吻，逗人笑樂也。而三者尤以逗笑為最主要，說次之，唱則最少。演時一人謂之單口，二人謂之對口，亦有三人以至四五人者。普通則以二人為最多，一正一副，互相問答。所問所答，隨意牽扯，全無故事可言，如「繞口令」即取聲音相同之字而纏繞之，「對對子」即一出上聯，一答下聯，皆無非取悅觀衆，大快朶願而巳。故實與現今滬上所流行之滑稽無異。此種相聲，相傳創於淸末滿人阿刺兒及朱文文（即窮不怕）諸人，實則唐時所謂參軍戲者，即已具此規模，惟其時猶寓諷刺之意味，不如今之多屬滑稽胡調耳。</p>

<p>維城笑道：「一定這麽辦。我知道我到陳府上，老奶奶還要給我壓歲錢。不過，國器你說不贊成封建思想，倒又怎麼請我去看迎神賽會？」國器摸一摸脖子，把兩條腿在被裏架起來；被面上的餅乾，全滾到維城那邊去。他笑道：「賽會是鄉人的一種迷信舉動，我們看了，可以看出他們為什麽有這舉動：所以作一次改革社會的實地觀察；不能便說是隨聲附和者。至於打牌，你又該說我是腐化，這是興之所至，沒關係的。不然，國芳的買糖果，餅乾，便該列入浪費了。</p>
<p>國芳忙着打開一個花漆匣子，把糖果分給兩人，一邊又記住了維城說的壓歲錢，笑道：「葉先生說我祖母是不是也要給壓歲錢的，這利害也還是大家同樣的啊。國器也笑道：「你看了伯母，可不要想起自己的母親。」維城道：「對了，剛才國芳妹妹一提到令先妹，就眼圈一紅，很難過似的，可見得母子母女，完全是天性，雖然隔了很長久的時間，也還是磨滅不了這個影子。即如我吧，家母是在家裏倚閭望切，可是先父呢？我每一次回去，老是先向先父那個遺象前面，站着鞠一個躬，心裏便有說不出來的難過。家母總是指點着說：維城，你的眉毛，像你的父親。這終是平淡得再也不能平淡了，然而聽到我耳朶裏，宛如有人拿着一柄小刀子，刺在我心上，鼻子是酸了，眼淚再也止不住流了，想着人皆有父，緊我獨無，這無論如何，不是我常的朋友可以相提並論的。」</p>
<p>維城把國器兄妹，說得又有些黯然了。國器道：「我們現在躺一會吧，聽起來是風也小了雨也小了，大約船收了港，躺一會像小孩睡在搖籃裏，也許會睡着，明天，究竟精神要好一些。維城在火車上辛苦了，又是沒有雨具，走路格外吃力，睡吧，反正我們在新年裏，預備暢談。」國器說了，像是示範一般，先躺了下去。維城為了避嫌起見，也往下一鑽。只有國芳拈了一塊搪放在嘴裹嚼着，閉了眼，至於半靠半坐的姿勢，還是沒什麽變更。（一〇）</p>

<p>Major Land, Sea, and Air Battle Underway</p>
<p>Saigon, 1st (Allied News Agency telegram) - A Batavia dispatch broadcast by a San Francisco radio station states that the Dutch East Indies government has officially acknowledged that Japanese troops have landed on the northern coast of Java. However, the landing locations and the number of Japanese troops are unknown.</p>
<p>Bandung, 1st (Reuters telegram) - The Dutch East Indies government issued a public statement today stating that after yesterday's naval battle in the Java Sea, Japanese troops landed at three locations on the northern coast of Java last night. The Japanese landing was met with resistance from Allied naval forces.</p>
<p>Bandung, 1st (Reuters telegram) - Allied air and naval forces fought fiercely with the landing Japanese troops throughout last night.</p>
<p>Batavia, 1st (Reuters telegram) - The Battle of Java is currently being waged on land, at sea, and in the air. Despite fierce resistance from Allied fleets, Japanese transport ships, under escort, managed to reach the northern coast of Java. Japanese troops are disembarking and are currently facing resistance from defending forces. It is reported that Allied forces are attempting to repel the Japanese fleet, and the naval battle has been ongoing for thirty-six hours. The skies over Java are filled with the roar of aircraft day and night, as Allied planes shuttle between Japanese bridgeheads and their bases, constantly reloading ammunition and refueling for battle. The vanguard of the landing Japanese troops consists of elite units well-trained in amphibious warfare, supported by dense Japanese air cover. These Japanese aircraft are reportedly taking off from airfields captured by the Japanese in Sumatra, Bali, and southern Borneo. It is reported that the land battles are currently quite chaotic. The Japanese have chosen landing sites crisscrossed by small rivers and dotted with coastal highways. Some Japanese troops may have already infiltrated the area. A communiqué issued by the Dutch East Indies military headquarters stated that the Japanese launched their attack on Java last night.</p>
<p>Saigon, 1st (Haitong News Agency telegram) - Japanese troops landed in Java this morning, a prelude to the attack on this important Dutch East Indies island. The importance of Java is universally recognized, with a population of 42 million, compared to the total population of the Dutch East Indies of only 60 million. Java has a total length of 1,060 kilometers and a maximum width of 200 kilometers. The capital, Batavia, has a population of 500,000, while Surabaya is a major seaport and naval base, as well as the headquarters of the army, with a population of approximately 300,000. Java is extremely rich in resources, although the quantity of raw materials produced is not as significant as the oilfields of Borneo and Semarang, or the tin mines of Bangka and Belitung.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Allied News Agency telegram) - The Japanese Imperial General Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM today that as a result of the naval battle off Surabaya, Java, on the 27th and 28th of last month, as of this morning, it is confirmed that three enemy cruisers and six destroyers have been sunk, and four enemy cruisers have been heavily damaged. Furthermore, as a result of the naval battle off Batavia this morning, Japanese ships have sunk one U.S. heavy cruiser and one Australian cruiser.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Allied News Agency telegram) - The Japanese Imperial General Headquarters announced at 4:50 PM today that a large formation of Japanese aircraft heavily bombed an enemy fleet in the Sunda Strait, west of Java, on the 27th and 28th of last month, setting fire to one 3,000-ton ship and heavily damaging two cruisers and one destroyer.</p>
<p>Saigon, 1st (Haitong News Agency telegram) - According to news received here last night from the capital of the Dutch East Indies, the first official statement regarding the naval battle of Java was announced in Batavia yesterday afternoon. According to the official communiqué, on Friday, a Japanese fleet escorting a convoy on the Java Sea was intercepted by an Allied fleet. Both sides suffered considerable losses in the naval battle. No further details were released.</p>
<p>Port Moresby Bombed, Japanese Forces in Palembang Advance Westward</p>
<p>Melbourne, 1st (Reuters telegram) - Melbourne issued a statement today stating that yesterday afternoon, Japanese bombers and fighters attacked Port Moresby (British New Guinea). The port suffered minor damage. Australian air force reconnaissance planes attempted to attack a Japanese convoy off Kupang (capital of Dutch Timor), but were intercepted by fighters.</p>
<p>Saigon, 1st (Haitong News Agency telegram) - News from Batavia last night reported several air raid alerts in Surabaya yesterday. Japanese planes approached Surabaya, but did not drop bombs. Twelve Japanese planes attacked an airfield in western Java, destroying several buildings and aircraft on the ground. Furthermore, news indicates that Japanese forces in Palembang are now advancing westward into central Sumatra.</p>

<p>Washington, 28th (Havas telegram) - Those responsible for the Pearl Harbor incident, namely, former U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Admiral Kimmel and Hawaiian Fortress Commander Major General Short, will be court-martialed on charges of inexcusable negligence of duty. According to an announcement by the War Department, Major General Short's request for retirement has been approved, effective from February 28th. However, this does not absolve him of responsibility, nor does it mean that no further disciplinary action will be taken against him. In addition, according to an announcement by the Navy Department, if Admiral Kimmel also requests retirement, the procedure will be the same as that for Major General Short, but it must take effect on March 1st. The court-martial will be based on the Pearl Harbor report submitted by Supreme Court Justice Roberts.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 1st (Allied News Agency telegram) - The Tokyo "Nichinichi Shimbun" today quoted Bangkok as saying that as a result of General Chiang Kai-shek's recent visit to India, an agreement has been reached with the Indian authorities to mutually dispatch military representatives. Chongqing has now decided to send a general-level officer to India to expedite the shipment of all military supplies from the Burma Road to China.</p>
<p>British Emphasize the Importance of the Indian Question</p>
<p>London, 28th (Havas telegram) - Sir Walter Layton, former editor of "The Economist" magazine, submitted a letter to Prime Minister Churchill today, proposing a new plan for the Indian question. He argued that matters relating to India should be transferred from the India Office to the Dominions Office, and that the Indian Executive Council and provincial governments should be thoroughly reformed. At the same time, he stated that the issue of the Indian Federation should be left for post-war discussion, and that for the present, only the so-called "British India" portion should be designated as a dominion.</p>
<p>London, 1st (Reuters telegram) - Attlee recently published an article in the "Times" Sunday supplement, stating that it is regrettable that important Indian leaders have not been granted the status of (free) defenders in the long run, both in Britain and among our common friends. We are now at a critical juncture, and we should no longer dwell on the reasons that have hindered cooperation between Britain and India in the past. Since the outbreak of this war, the trend indicates that after the Allied victory, India will have a good opportunity to participate in international politics. If the Allies fail, India's fate will be reversed, perhaps for centuries to come. The situation is the same for us. India now has direct diplomatic relations with the United States and stands on the same front with its great neighbor China. There is no need to worry excessively about its post-war status.

<p>London, 1st (Reuters telegram) - The three services (Army, Navy, and Air Force) issued a joint communiqué last night stating that after midnight on February 27th, British air forces used paratroopers under moonlight to attack Blonville-sur-Mer, 12 miles north of Le Havre, in the German-occupied area of France. The German side suffered disruption of wireless communications. The German side resisted strongly, but the paratroopers were still able to complete their mission, withdraw from the coast, and, with the protection of British army units, board ships and return to their home country with very few casualties. This is the first time Britain has used paratroopers to attack German-occupied areas.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 1st (Havas telegram) - The British attack by paratroopers on the German wireless station on the French coast has been widely commented on by the British, but military circles in Berlin have remained silent, considering it insignificant. However, according to a London dispatch in a Swiss newspaper, the British side is now discussing whether this move is a prelude to other important developments. In February of last year, when Britain launched an offensive in Libya, it also took similar actions against Italy. What London is now emphasizing is whether Britain intends to launch an offensive on the European continent in the spring to force the German army to deal with a second front. This question has been publicly discussed by certain newspapers.</p>

<h3 id="e25">Hua Weier Discusses the Qualities of a General (8) <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>One should not hesitate to praise subordinates verbally or in writing for their praiseworthy qualities. He should make as much contact with his subordinates as possible to create a good impression. Red tape also has its uses, but one should never use sarcastic tones when addressing subordinates; such cleverness is harmful to both parties and will inevitably provoke anger. One should always tell the truth, unless it is necessary to keep secrets, such as battle plans. During the last war, what displeased soldiers the most were the propaganda materials from the intelligence department that portrayed the morale of German soldiers as low, because they clearly knew from the front lines that the fighting power of the German soldiers was still very strong!</p>
<p>In short, the relationship between a general and his subordinates is very similar to the relationship between a rider and a horse. Horses not only need to be disciplined and trained, but also encouraged. An old hunter's saying goes: "Kept in the stable, it seems worth five hundred pounds; galloped under the saddle, it seems not worth half a penny." From the horse's own comfort, it not only knows whether the rider's skills are excellent, but also whether the rider is brave or cowardly, decisive or hesitant. A general must sometimes drive his soldiers, just like riding a horse; and the best riders and horse owners are not necessarily the people who love horses the most. A general has ways to make his superiors believe in him, to believe that he is a good commander; but without real ability, he cannot make his subordinates say that he is a good commander.</p>
<p>Three · Generals and Politicians</p>
<p>This time I want to talk about the relationship between senior commanders and superiors, what is called superiors refers to politicians who lead the war, this is another controversial and difficult to solve problem. As you all know, the relationship between British generals and politicians in the last war was very disharmonious. Generally speaking, politicians always blame generals for being narrow-minded and holding military prejudices, while generals tend to attribute many difficulties to "political interference." This friction between politics and military affairs is a relatively new wartime problem, which is a characteristic of democracy, not autocracy.</p>
<p>In ancient times, there were very few disputes between politics and military affairs. In fact, soldiers and politicians were often indistinguishable. Those who have read ancient Greek history must know about the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta. Regarding that war, there is a story about Cleon and Nicias of Athens. At that time, Cleon was the leader of the opposition party and often criticized the conservative Nicias. Nicias wanted to eliminate the attacks of his political enemies, so he retorted, saying: "Okay, then let you command the three armies, and see if you can do better." Unexpectedly, Cleon actually agreed and started a fortunate great victory. This was unfortunate for Nicias, but it did not have a good result for Athens in the end. In ancient Rome, military officers had to serve as administrative officials at all levels first. When there was a vacancy for a general, it was selected from administrative officials. Macaulay described the very wise measures taken by the elders of the city when the city encountered extraordinary events in "Songs of Ancient Rome": In the autumn of crisis and survival, it is best for someone to take power. Let us elect a dictator, and everyone must obey. Give him six months as dictator, and no extensions are allowed when the term expires, known as the hero of knights, holding twenty-four axes. Isn't this method very simple? If modern dictators still had such term limits, perhaps Europe would be much more peaceful.</p>
<p>In the earliest democratic countries, a general's plan was reduced to a pie in the sky due to political negligence. The history of Hannibal can serve as the first proof. For many years, the monarchs of countries often personally led their troops to war (for example, Alexander, many former English kings, Cosdoff II, etc.), and naturally there would be no problem of political interference. Marlborough's position was quite peculiar. In addition to serving as the commander-in-chief of the army, he was practically no different from the foreign minister, and the country's foreign policy was decided in his headquarters. When he was at his peak, he also held power in domestic politics equivalent to that of the prime minister. However, due to the interference of Dutch politicians and the hostility of domestic political enemies, his plans were repeatedly sabotaged, which I am afraid other generals have not experienced. He was able to deal with all this calmly, just as he showed on the battlefield. Although he had many faults, he was truly a great man; and in my opinion, he is undoubtedly the greatest military genius in England.</p>
<p>Generals who interfere in politics have always been cursed by the British military tradition, but most of the famous British generals have had political experience. Before becoming a soldier, Cromwell served as a member of parliament for many years. Marlborough, whom we just mentioned, had far more experience in political conspiracies than military experience when he started his military career. Wellington served as a member of parliament in Ireland and England. Moore and Crawford both attended parliament; so did Graham, the victor of Barossa (later Lord Lynedoch), who was already forty-four years old when he first took command of the army. Conversely, in the French Revolutionary Wars, we saw that political commissars often hindered military work. This phenomenon only disappeared when Napoleon raised himself to be a dictator, whose term was not six months but a general "during this period."</p>
<p>My search for things in war history is no different from a hunting dog chasing an island, so the next example is about the American Civil War. The relationship between the great and intelligent Lincoln and his subordinates is really worth studying. After several trials, he found a general he could trust, and he listened to his command and did not interfere in the slightest. This general was Grant. Listen to me read a passage from Lincoln's letter to his general, and I think his character can be seen from this.</p>

<p>Zhenhai Limits the Quantity of Items Carried</p>
<p>The two concessions are sparing no effort to evacuate the population. The Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Evacuation Association has recently increased the number of public groups entrusted to issue passes, so that citizens can apply nearby. Since the 16th of last month, the issuance of half-price passes has been limited to factories. Now, citizens of other occupations who leave Shanghai can also apply for issuance, in order to exert the effect of evacuation. The Shanghai Municipal Council's office for issuing return home passes was still issuing passes as usual yesterday, although it was Sunday. Other branch offices are also issuing them. As for the social groups entrusted to issue passes, such as the China Travel Service and the Chinese Educational Morality Society, the number of applicants is also very crowded.</p>
<p>Attention to Passengers Leaving Shanghai for Ningbo</p>
<p>According to news from Ningbo groups in Shanghai, because the concession authorities are evacuating citizens who do not need to live in Shanghai, the number of natives from various counties in Ningbo returning to their hometown is thousands per day. However, the journey is difficult, and those who are not used to traveling are easily deceived. It is found that Shanghai-Ningbo ships are now mostly docked at the Yangtze Wharf. The company's barges pick up and drop off passengers at designated wharfs on the Bund. However, because the boats are small and there are many people, they are often crowded. The old, the weak, or those carrying a lot of luggage all complain. According to experienced travelers, it is best for four or five people to hire a sampan to go directly to the Yangtze Wharf with several pieces of luggage. It is best to hire the sampan at the Lengjing Wharf. It costs about eight or nine yuan from the Bund to the Yangtze Wharf. It is learned that the Mingmen Maru has been directly docking at the Taikoo Wharf on the Bund of the French Concession since this shift. Passengers can directly board the ship. Other ships such as Haitong and Wanji still need to be transferred.</p>
<p>Zhenhai Limits Items Carried</p>
<p>Zhenhai has set the following restrictions on the quantity of items carried by passengers from Shanghai to Zhenhai Port: The quantity of items each passenger from Shanghai to Zhenhai is allowed to carry is: three yards of cotton cloth (i.e., nine feet, equivalent to eight and a half feet in the market), two ounces of cotton yarn (about one-sixth of a pound), three yards of rayon cloth (i.e., nine feet, equivalent to eight and a half feet in the market), the same as above for woolen fabrics (i.e., woolen fabrics), two ounces of woolen yarn (about one-sixth of a pound), one hundred cigarettes, twenty-five Lvwei cigarettes, five small boxes of matches, one catty of sugar, one catty of salt, one package of foreign candles, six bars of soap (for laundry), 200 watts of wax candle raw materials, five he of cooking oil (about twelve taels). It is also learned that the quantity of items each passenger from Ningbo to Shanghai via Zhenhai is allowed to carry is: one dou of rice, two dou and five sheng of wheat, seven sheng of beans, twenty eggs, one catty of tea.</p>

The registration form for the raw materials they need each month can be obtained from the Food and Price Management Section at No. 2 Fuli Road. After the form is filled out, it should be returned to the section by the person in charge. As for the amount of coal needed, regardless of whether it has been registered before, it should also be stated clearly. The registration will close on March 7. In the future, the supply of raw materials will be based on the exact number filled in, so those concerned should fill in the form quickly and carefully. Please inform everyone."</p>

<p>The money exchange industry in this city held its annual meeting at Wanli Restaurant on Fuzhou Road at noon yesterday. One hundred and two member companies of Fulushouxi industry members attended. During the meeting, opinions were exchanged, the business policy for this year was determined, and many cases were discussed. The meeting started at 12 o'clock noon. Chairman Pan Bingshen delivered a speech, encouraging the industry members with three points: The business policy of the industry this year should be based on stability; the industry members should cooperate sincerely; help each other and love each other, and overcome difficulties together. Standing Committee member and manager of the money exchange industry reserve bank Liu Xichen, Standing Committee member Wen Zhenwei, consultant Chen Jinhai, Wu Shiqin, etc., successively made speeches, and explained the significance of adding consultants to the association. Because the association affairs are becoming more and more complicated and the responsibilities are becoming heavier, consultants are added to assist in the progress of the association affairs.</p>
<p>Tolerant Acceptance of Damaged Banknotes</p>
<p>Finally, members expressed their opinions one after another. The result was summarized, and it was resolved that damaged banknotes should be mutually used as much as possible in the future and should not be overly picky. The members who attended the meeting should also inform the staff on the counter to accept and exchange them at their discretion. The business policy of this industry has always been stable and cautious, and it should be even more so this year. Advertising for business should not be too excessive, which would demean the reputation of the industry.</p>
<p>Fourteen Fewer Listed Members</p>
<p>Finally, the director of the association, Wang Ming, reported that the total number of members last year was 116, and the number of members listed this year was 102, a decrease of 14. He then reported the association's revenue and expenditure accounts briefly, and then dinner began. During the dinner, there was a lot of toasting, which was very lively for a while.</p>

<h3 id="e30">Shanghai and Nanyang Trade May Recover; Monthly Exports Before the Pacific War Were About 50 Million; If Trade Recovers, Shanghai's Industry Will Gain New Vitality <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The famous economist Mr. An Hanning published an article in the English "Great America Evening News" yesterday, saying that this city and Nanyang, which is within the Japanese sphere of influence, may soon restore trade relations. This possibility is of great concern to the industrial circles of this city, because in the past two years, various countries in Nanyang have been major customers of industrial products in this city.</p>
<p>Trend of Shanghai-Hong Kong-Nanyang Trade</p>
<p>Among them, Hong Kong is the largest customer. Last year, the goods shipped from this city to Hong Kong were worth more than 400 million yuan, accounting for about 12% of Shanghai's total exports. However, Hong Kong is a transshipment center, so most of the goods shipped from this city are transshipped elsewhere, either to Southeast Asia or to Europe and the United States. Therefore, the export trade from Shanghai to Hong Kong can only be regarded as a small part of Nanyang trade. According to statistics on Shanghai trade, in the months before the Pacific War, the average monthly value of goods exported to Hong Kong, Malaya, the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, and Vietnam was about 50 million yuan, accounting for about 12% of the city's exports.</p>
<p>Cotton Goods Ban May Be Lifted</p>
<p>The goods shipped from this city to Nanyang were originally dominated by machinery, but after the ban on the export of cotton goods, they were completely suspended. Before the ban, the export of cotton yarn and cotton fabrics accounted for about 70% of Shanghai's exports to Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies, 60% to the Philippines and Malaya, and more than 50% to Thailand and Hong Kong. This is because after the outbreak of the European War, various places in Nanyang could not obtain supplies from Western Europe and turned to Shanghai for supplies. Once Nanyang trade recovers, that area will still be an important market for the cotton textile industry in this city, and the ban on the export of cotton goods may be lifted.</p>
<p>Shanghai Industry Gains New Vitality</p>
<p>Other industries in this city have also developed important markets in Nanyang in the past few years. The goods shipped from this city to the Netherlands include a large number of glass and glassware, enamel ironware, and pharmaceuticals. The goods exported to Thailand are mainly cotton fabrics, herbs, light bulbs, and glass. Singapore needs glass, chemicals, ironware, etc., while the Philippines is a major customer of electrical appliances, enamelware, ironware, etc. There are also various foods sold to various places in Nanyang. From this point of view, the recovery of Nanyang trade, even if the scope is limited, may give new vitality to Shanghai's industry, and the economic situation in this city can also be improved as a result.</p>

<p>According to authoritative sources, the agreement on the issuance of joint bicycle licenses was signed a few days ago, but the date of implementation of the agreement has not yet been determined. It is rumored that one of the signatories of the agreement was Mr. Phillips, the Director-General representing the Shanghai Municipal Council, but the authorities have not officially confirmed this. It is also learned that according to the agreement, each bicycle owner must obtain his joint license from the competent authority. For example, bicycle owners living in the International Settlement should obtain it from the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, and those living in the French Concession should obtain it from the French Police Department. As for the license fee, each region will collect it separately. The bicycle license fee paid by residents of the International Settlement will be used by the Shanghai Municipal Council. If the bicycle owner has already obtained three licenses from various regions, he can exchange them for one joint license.</p>

<p>The Five Religions Bookstore held an initiators' meeting a few days ago. Mr. Huang Jingwan proposed that this year is the year of the Five Religions, which was well received by all parties. It is now learned that Mr. Wen Lantin, the initiator of the bookstore, made a speech on this year of the Five Religions, saying that the five major religions of Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity and Islam each have a long history and great achievements, but their purpose of guiding people to do good is the same. However, calling it the Five Religions is not to create another religion, but to promote the essence of each religion and make people return to the ultimate good. He hopes that people from all walks of life will help the Five Religions Bookstore, which is being prepared this year of the Five Religions.</p>

<p>— Chief Editor</p>
<p>I am a lover of cigarettes and have a very strong addiction. The amount of cigarettes I smoke every day is about no less than fifty. In the past, I smoked White Tin Bags and Three Gun Towers (about one yuan per tin at that time). Now I have to downgrade again and again and smoke some of the most common cigarettes, but the amount still cannot be reduced. In the past few days, cigarettes have skyrocketed. A box of fifty Great Front Doors costs eleven yuan. It is really difficult to continue. Although I have been determined to quit smoking several times, I relapse after quitting and it is ultimately ineffective. I think there is no statistics on the number of smokers in Shanghai, but I think there must be a lot. There must be many people who share the same suffering as me. I wonder if there is a most appropriate way to quit this smoking habit forever.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Confucius Does Not Limit Confucianism <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Zhongyi</p>
<p>The 34th lecture of the "Melting Five Classics Society" and the 4th lecture of the "National Studies Forum" featured Mr. Shen Jueling lecturing on the first section of the ancient version of "The Great Learning." His summary stated that the "four things to be aimed at" in "The Great Learning" reveal the location of the Dao (Way), which does not require seeking elsewhere. "Loving the people"—Zhu Xi's version renders this as "renewing the people," since the second section contains phrases such as "If you can one day renovate yourself, do so from day to day. Yea, let there be daily renovation," so "renewing the people" is also understandable. However, considering the phrases "A gentleman values the virtuous and loves his kin; common people rejoice in their pleasures and seek their own profit," "loving the people" is better, because without first loving the people, there can be no "renewing" of the people. "Stopping at the ultimate good" and "knowing where to stop and then having direction" are consistent with the principles of "stopping and observing" and "stillness and tranquility" in Buddhism. Knowing what comes first and what comes after is "drawing near to the Dao," which opens the meaning of the following two sections. Regarding the theory of "investigating things," since Zheng Kangcheng, there have been over seventy schools of thought, none of which fall outside of the "mind-only" and "matter-only" schools. In reality, this is what we now call science. Every subject within physics, chemistry, biology (including zoology and botany), and mineralogy can fulfill the meaning of "investigating things." Our country placed little emphasis on the word "at" in "investigating things at," lacking preliminary work, which led to cultural backwardness. Western countries focused heavily on this, achieving rapid advancements, but neglected the concept of "governing and pacifying," thus developing instruments of death and causing two world wars. It can be seen that placing exclusive emphasis on either "mind-only" or "matter-only" both have drawbacks. The words of Confucius are perfectly integrated. The six sections of "The Great Learning" all end with phrases such as "This is what is meant by knowing the root," and "This is what is meant by perfecting knowledge," which are rooted in the phrase "cultivating oneself as the root." The theory that "four missing characters were secretly transmitted" and thus "this is what is meant by investigating things" was easily changed to "this is what is meant by knowing the root," making it a laughable error to tamper with the ancient text.</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Zhongyi spoke on "Confucius Does Not Limit Confucianism." First, Confucianism (the meaning of Confucianism): "Ru" [儒], in the "Shuowen" [《說文》, an ancient Chinese dictionary], means "soft," a title for "practitioners." "Softness" means a gentleman is difficult to advance but easy to retreat, and Lao Tzu knows "strength" and guards "weakness"—only the utmost softness in the world can control the utmost strength in the world. "Practitioner" refers to Confucian conduct: "managing the Dao and sharing the same arts." Yanzi: "The arts have order and reason." Emperor Xuan of Han: "Cultivate literature and canonical arts." Xiangru Zhuan Yan Note: "All who have Dao arts are called Ru." Zheng Xuan's note on the Zhou Li Taizai: "Ru use the Dao to gain the people." "Ru? The Houbo clan has six arts to teach the people." The note on the Dasitu says, "Teachers and Ru in the villages teach the Dao and arts." The note on the table of contents of the Book of Rites says: "Because it records the conduct of those with morality." According to the Analects, "A gentleman learns to attain his Dao," so in ancient times, the Dao arts were the learning of scholars and gentlemen, and those who devoted themselves to the Dao arts and attained their entirety were gentlemen. Fayan: "Calling those who understand Heaven, Earth, and Man Ru." This is correct.</p>
<p>The divisions of Confucianism: When the Analects speaks of Confucianism, only Yongye records the distinction between "gentlemanly Ru and petty Ru," and Confucius never admitted to being a Ru. Mencius speaks of Ru, only in Jinxin: "The Mohists will definitely return to Yang, and the Yangists will definitely return to Ru." There are three divisions. Although the Ru are followers of sages, Mencius never admitted to being a Ru either. What is described as "sage" is impartial, capable, and harmonious, none of which are limited to Confucianism, let alone Confucius, who is the embodiment of sagehood. By the time of Xunzi's "Exhortation to Learning," there were distinctions between "vulgar people, vulgar Ru, refined Ru, and great Ru," and also "great Ru, small Ru, and the masses," beginning to consider oneself as a Ru. He considered the Duke of Zhou, Confucius, and Zigong as great Ru, and despised the vulgar Ru, who were no different from the Mohists. The non-twelve chapter is divided into six schools, with Confucius and Zigong overseeing them, not aligning with the six schools. His disciple Han Fei then said, "The prominent schools in the world are Confucianism and Mohism. Confucius is the origin of Confucianism, and Mo Di is the origin of Mohism," "Eight Ru and three Mohists, dividing the world into halves." ("Confucius Does Not Necessarily Have to Be Ru"). Shizi Guangze chapter narrates the honor of the six disciples, including "Confucius values impartiality," and cites the text of Erya Shiggu saying "more than a dozen names are in fact one." Lu Lan Bu Er chapter narrates the honor of the ten disciples, including "Confucius values benevolence," and says, "Being able to harmonize all differences, as if they came from one, only a sage can do that." None of them say that Confucius values Confucianism. (Confucius Is Not Limited to the Confucian School) Zhuangzi Xu Wugui: "Confucianism, Mohism, Yangism, and Bingism, along with Huiism, make five." The Tianxia chapter divides into six schools, and Confucianism is not included. It traces the origins of each school to a consistent Dao, saying, "Sages are born from something, kings are made from something, all originate from one." "The ancients were comprehensive, matching the gods, pure with Heaven and Earth, nurturing all things, harmonizing the world, benefiting the people, understanding all, great and small, fine and coarse, their operation was everywhere." "As for the poetry, books, rites, and music, the scholars of Zou and Lu, the gentlemen and elders, mostly understand them." "Their methods are scattered throughout the world and established in China, the hundred schools of thought sometimes praise and speak of them." Who is this? Is it not the Confucius of inner sagehood and outer kingship, the first of his kind? It also says, "The world is in great chaos, the worthy and sages are unclear," "Scholars of one song cannot communicate," "Therefore, the Dao of inner sagehood and outer kingship is dark and unclear, depressed and not expressed. People in the world each do what they desire to make their own way. Later scholars are unfortunate not to see the purity of Heaven and Earth, the great body of the ancients, and the Dao arts will be torn apart for the world." The Dao arts of Confucius were torn apart, and then there were the methods of the hundred schools. Zhuangzi knew that Confucius was not limited by Confucianism.</p>
<p>Confucian scholars: Huainan Yaolue divides into eight schools, saying, "The Dao is everywhere, but only sages can grasp the root and know the end." "Confucius cultivated the Dao of Cheng and Kang, and narrated the teachings of the Duke of Zhou, to teach the seventy disciples, from which the Ru scholars emerged." Began to be named Ru scholars. Shi Tan Lun Liujia Yaozhi, Dao, Fa, Ming, are all called "Jia" (school), while Ru and Mo are called "Zhe" (scholars), saying, "Ru scholars are broad but lack essentials, work hard but achieve little, and it is difficult to follow them completely." This is not the Confucius praised by the Shijia, "with lofty conduct and integrity, mediating to reach sagehood."</p>
<p>Confucian school: Han Shu Yiwen Zhi narrates the nine streams, beginning with "Confucian School," and says, "Ancestors Yao and Shun, models Wen and Wu, the master Zhongni." It can be seen that Confucius inherited from Yao, Shun, Wen, and Wu, and was not limited to Confucianism. Sui Shu Jingji Zhi narrates the Ru, saying, "Zhongni inherited from previous generations, corrected the six classics, and three thousand disciples all received his teachings. As for the Warring States period, the likes of Zisi, Mencius, and Xunqing followed and revered him." It can be seen that the name Ru first appeared after the three thousand disciples, and in the Warring States period, it came from Xun Kuang's self-designation. Confucius was the one they followed and revered, but he was not limited to Confucianism, just like Yao, Shun, Wen, Wu, the Duke of Zhou, and Yi Yin and Yi Hui were not limited to Confucianism. Furthermore, it says, "Without the Dao of Yu, it is not enough to be a Moist," and Yu was not a Moist. It also says, "Without the Dao of Confucius, it is not enough to be a Ru," and Confucius was also not limited to the Confucian school. If what the Ru revered must also be Ru, then where should the carpenter who worships Lu Ban and the barber who honors Guan Gong be placed?</p>
<p>Confucian sayings: Zuo Zhuan Ai 21, "Only their Ru books," Shiji Tian Fen Zhuan, "devoted to promoting Confucian arts," Hejian Shijia, "The king loved Confucian learning," Shusun Tong Zhuan, "finally became the Confucian master."</p>
<p>Confucian conduct: The Confucian Conduct chapter of the Book of Rites records Confucius answering Duke Ai's seventeen questions about Confucianism. The Ru has such and such, but it is only a gain of one aspect. Later generations mistakenly recognized Confucius as a Confucian. Chen Hao Jishuo cites Li Shi saying, "Confucian conduct is not the words of Confucius, but the noble sentiments of the heroes of the Warring States period, mostly exaggerating themselves to deceive their rulers. How can this be what is called Confucius?"</p>

<p>— Du Yasheng</p>
<p>Dear readers, this year I will tell you all about a strange encounter that I have never experienced in my life. However, do not think that I have really encountered something ghostly just because you read the title. That is something that exists in "Stage and Screen". In broad daylight, in a bright and clear world, I have not seen it. The so-called "hell" here is a small inn on the edge of the concession. I wandered in the dim corner of the accounting room (in fact, there was only one accounting table) for about twenty minutes. What I saw and heard will be deeply imprinted in my memory. That is, you, all of you gentlemen, if you have the opportunity to go there, I think no one will forget this unprecedented adventure.</p>
<p>I have a distant relative who was expelled from his family by newspaper announcement. The extent of his "unfilial" can be imagined. Recently, his family received a letter of repentance from him, willing to return home and start a new life. However, this kind of "vows of eternal love" is not the first time, so naturally they ignored it. His mother, however, was very concerned about her son and often secretly asked people to visit him at the address on his letter. Last week, she entrusted me with this matter.</p>
<p>I have heard enough about the crimes of this wanderer, but I always hope that he can suddenly see the light and become a Buddha on the spot. So I went to the address.</p>
<p>This kind of small inn may be the same as the kind of "feather shop" that Cao Yu visited to write "Sunrise". I found a so-called accountant and told him who I was looking for.</p>
<p>In the dim light of the only kerosene lamp, the accountant carefully looked at my identity, with suspicion and fear. I don't know.</p>
<p>Finally, he gave me a disdainful answer: "There are only A Mao and A Gou here, no Mr. ×××!"</p>
<p>This made it impossible for me to deal with, because I didn't know if my relative had an elegant seal of "A ×".</p>
<p>At this time, a figure窜out from the darkness. He was a fifteen or sixteen year old child. Judging from his walking, talking, and all his actions, his life experience may be richer than that of Mr. Ma Xiangbo. He also looked at me first before slowly asking me: "Are you looking for ×××?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Little brother." I felt that this child was very cute.</p>
<p>"He's not here anymore."</p>
<p>The accountant suddenly seemed to understand and said, "Little Gou, is it Little Ma?"</p>
<p>My relative's surname is Ma. Calling him Little Ma is naturally more convenient and straightforward than "Ma ××".</p>
<p>"Yes, Little Ma." After discovering a glimmer of light, I could not let go of the opportunity and forced the child to ask, "Can you tell me where he went?"</p>
<p>"He went to the South City. It's been a month already!" After speaking, he touched the accountant with his hand and said, "Check the account book, when did Little Ma leave?"</p>
<p>"Humph!" The accountant was a little angry. "I'm unlucky if I flip through the account book except for official business!"</p>
<p>This seemed to irritate Little Gou, who gave me a contemptuous look. "Are you really looking for Little Ma?"</p>
<p>I was also a little angry, and then I became smart and asked, "Does Little Ma owe rent?"</p>
<p>"Owe rent?" The child laughed loudly, patted my shoulder, like an elementary school teacher on the podium. "Sir, what kind of place is this? You can't even think about sleeping in the room without money!" Saying that, he picked out half a cigarette butt from behind his ear and asked the accountant for a match.</p>
<p>"Do you also smoke?" I asked him.</p>
<p>"Do you have cigarettes?" He asked me back, "Give me one!"</p>
<p>I gave him a cigarette and also gave the accountant one. Unexpectedly, it was this cigarette that made the accountant happy. He thanked me again and again and automatically went to flip through a tattered account book. I took the opportunity to take a look. There were some unknown marks painted on it. After a while, he told me when Little Ma left and twisted Little Gou's ear, scolding, "Little bastard, you left with him on the same day. Where did you go together?"</p>
<p>"South City!"</p>
<p>"What did you do in the South City?" I hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>"Doing business!"</p>
<p>The accountant nodded and said, "Can't you move yourself?"</p>
<p>The child also nodded, seeming very sad.</p>
<p>Although I am not an old Shanghainese, I understand this a little, so I asked him, "Big business or small business?"</p>
<p>"Nothing big, just robbing pancakes."</p>
<p>When he said this, he seemed very uneasy. I knew he was lying, but it was also evident that the child's nature was not yet corrupted. I sternly questioned, "Don't lie, tell the truth!" I threw a pack of cigarettes in my pocket to him.</p>
<p>Half of it was my voice that subdued him, and half of it was that the pack of cigarettes also had an effect. He smiled at me. It was a naive smile. "He lost in robbing the cigarette paper shop, but he will come out eventually."</p>
<p>"Little ghost, don't write, no wonder…………" The accountant spat at him.</p>
<p>"I'm not coming," he defended quickly. "He robbed the banknotes and wanted to take the cigarettes."</p>
<p>I patted his head and asked him, "Have you studied?"</p>
<p>"I have studied."</p>
<p>"Do you want to study again?"</p>
<p>He did not answer, but immediately shook his head.</p>
<p>I gave him five yuan. "If Little Ma comes out, you can ask him to stay here. I will come to see you again."</p>
<p>He folded the banknote small and stuffed it into his waistband. When he reached out, he held another piece of paper and waved it at me. "Sir, it's a pawn ticket for a pair of horse-riding breeches. Do you want it?"</p>
<p>I wanted to laugh, but I couldn't laugh. I said, "I wear a suit." "You can redeem it and sell it again. It's only for fifty yuan."</p>
<p>"Why don't you sell the pawn ticket?"</p>
<p>"One yuan and five points, five fives two yuan and five corners. I won't sell it!"</p>
<p>When I stepped out of this small inn, I ran into a familiar person walking in. The child pushed my hand. "Do you recognize him? He's a comedian ×××, who used to be very popular!"</p>
<p>I nodded, speechless, watching him walk towards the iron gate, and then turned back to take one last look at the small inn. It was just a black mass inside.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Crosstalk <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— Zefu</p>
<p>Crosstalk was originally a kind of ventriloquism. Xiang means likeness. One person imitates various sounds to resemble them. This kind of simple ventriloquism was popular in the early Qing Dynasty. Only one person would sit behind the curtain and do it. However, what is now called crosstalk in the North is no longer so simple. In addition to imitations of sound, there are also three elements: speaking, singing, and teasing. Speaking is telling jokes, singing is singing ditties, and teasing is two people teasing people with humorous tones. Among the three, teasing is the most important, speaking is second, and singing is the least. When performing, one person is called single crosstalk, two people are called dialogue crosstalk, and there are also three to four or five people. Usually, two people are the most common, one positive and one negative, asking and answering each other. The questions and answers are casually drawn, with no story to tell at all. For example, "tongue twisters" are used to entangle words with the same sounds, and "paired couplets" are one to give the first line and one to answer the second line, all for the purpose of pleasing the audience. It is actually no different from the comedy that is popular in Shanghai today. This kind of crosstalk is said to have been created by the Manchu Alar'er and Zhu Wenwen (also known as Poor Fear) and others in the late Qing Dynasty. In fact, the so-called military drama in the Tang Dynasty already had this scale, but at that time it still had a satirical meaning, unlike today's mostly humorous nonsense.</p>

<p>— He Jiazhai</p>
<p>(I) The Evening of Wind and Rain</p>
<p>Weicheng smiled and said, "It must be done this way. I know that when I go to Chen's house, the old grandmother will still give me lucky money. However, Guoqi, you said you don't approve of feudal thoughts, so why are you inviting me to watch the welcoming god festival?" Guoqi touched his neck and put his legs up in the quilt; the biscuits on the quilt all rolled over to Weicheng's side. He smiled and said, "The festival is a kind of superstitious act of the villagers. We can see why they have this act when we watch it; so we can make an on-site observation of social reform; we can't just say that we are echoing it. As for playing cards, you should say that I am corrupted. This is just a matter of interest, it doesn't matter. Otherwise, Guofang's buying candy and biscuits should be included in waste."</p>
<p>Guofang was busy opening a lacquered box, distributing candy to the two of them, while remembering the lucky money Weicheng said, and smiled: "Mr. Ye said that my grandmother will also give lucky money, this harm is still the same for everyone." Guoqi also smiled and said, "When you see your aunt, don't think of your own mother." Weicheng said: "That's right, just now, when Guofang mentioned your late sister, her eyes turned red and she seemed very sad. It can be seen that mothers and children are completely natural. Even if a long time has passed, this shadow cannot be erased. Just like me, my mother is looking forward to my return home, but what about my late father? Every time I go back, I always stand in front of my late father's portrait and bow. I have an unspeakable sadness in my heart. My mother always pointed and said: Weicheng, your eyebrows look like your father. This is ultimately plain and can't be any plainer, but when I hear it in my ears, it's as if someone is holding a small knife and stabbing my heart. My nose is sore, and I can't stop the tears from flowing. Thinking that everyone has a father, only I have none. This is by no means comparable to my usual friends."</p>
<p>Weicheng said that Guoqi and his sister were a little sad again. Guoqi said: "Let's lie down for a while now. It sounds like the wind and rain are getting smaller. The boat has probably returned to port. Lying down for a while is like a child sleeping in a cradle. Maybe we will fall asleep. Tomorrow, we should have better spirits. Weicheng worked hard on the train, and he didn't have rain gear, so walking was especially difficult. Let's sleep. Anyway, we are going to have a good talk in the New Year." After Guoqi said that, he lay down first as if demonstrating. Weicheng drilled down to avoid suspicion. Only Guofang picked up a piece of candy and chewed it in her mouth, with her eyes closed. As for the half-leaning and half-sitting posture, it was still not changed. (10)</p>
