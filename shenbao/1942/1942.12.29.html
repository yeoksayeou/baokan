<p>社評</p>
<h3>病·醫·藥</h3>
<p>目前本市社會問題，除了食糧問題之外，最爲一般市民所感覺困難的，恐怕要算疾病和醫業問題了。依照一般市民的習慣，都不把疾病和醫業的費用加入家庭預算裏面的。可是，實際上無論什麼人都不免爲疾病所侵製，尤其是薪工階層的市民，一方面旣不得不加倍勞瘁，始能勉强維持生活，對於健康大有「欲顧不得」之勢。另方　爲了生活困難，平日的營養一定不足，即有了病也不致向醫藥問津，拖得一天是一天，這樣，醫藥問題便一天嚴重一天了。固然，這是一個嚴重的社會問題，不是一時以獲得圓滿的解決的，然而我們更不能忽視這裏還存在有許多人爲的不良現象，因爲這些不艮現象的存在，增加了市民無限的痛苦，也增加了社會上的危機，我們不能不指出這些壞現象，並目特別希望工部局與市政當局和醫藥界共同努力消泯這些現象。</p>
<p>第一，在醫的方面，本市公立和私立的醫治機關，不謂不多，中西醫師的數量；更不能算少；照一般原理講，只要大家努力，是不會使市民十分感到醫病的苦痛的。可是，隨着物價的高漲，診治的收費，似乎也飛漲了。爲了高入雲霄的醫治費用，使大多數的市民，對於中西醫師，公私醫院，都有望而生畏之感，其次，說到醫師的診治情形，更不能不爲大多數市民的健康擔憂。據說有許多著名的中醫每日診治的病人，竟達一二百人之多，平均每一病人的診斷，不過一二分鐘，要說在這短促的時間而能認眞診療，那眞是神話。這種「名醫」的「草率從事」，至今社會上竟沒有加以取締，不能不說是社會的不幸。當然，這種情形不限於中醫，少數西醫對於病人診治的輕忽，也是難免的。</p>
<p>第二？在藥的方面，不問中西藥舖，在這物價高漲的浪潮中，藥價也隨着高漲了。所以大多數病人，往往勉强凑集了醫費，可給奇昂的藥費嚇倒了。其次，正因爲藥價的奇昂，少數藥商的應有的道德也逐漸消減了。於是，在中藥則不免偷工减料，在西藥則以已失時效的藥品照樣出售。再加上一般非藥商，也以藥品有利可圖，競相囤積，競相仿造；結果藥價日高，而藥品日劣，數百萬市民的健康更失去了保障。</p>
<p>一般公立醫院和私人醫療機關，也有爲了上述現象即有「貧病免費」的辦法，實在値得歛佩。可是，一則究竟這種醫師和醫院太少了，力量有限，補救得不多。二則就是「貧病免費」的，共中也有應加改善的。私人的不必說了，就是公立的，對於「貧病」所免的費，實在也很多問題，往往眞正赤貧者，得不到免費的實惠，被拒於醫院門外；對於必需住院的，一樣要預繳數百元醫藥費，這固然有免費之名而無其實。可是，對於並非眞正貧病，而只因爲他有「聞人」爲之介紹，或有私人可以設法，就可以享受免費的「優待」。</p>
<p>我們認爲醫藥界這種現象是再也不容存在下去的，希望當局和醫藥界熱心之士共謀改善的辦法。我們請求工部局及市政當局多撥公款，積極的籌謀增設和改善公立醫院，同時籌設公立藥房，以公道的價格供應藥物，使一般薪工階層的市民的健康　得保障，這些未嘗不是消滅社會危機增進社會幸福的重要步驟。</p>

<h3>在嚴寒下奮戰的德蘇　十二月廿二日大阪每日新聞社論</h3>
<p>在德蘇戰錢上，第二次的嚴寒又來臨了。去冬的這個時候，未曾有的酷寒侵襲着戰錢，攻防兩軍的近代化兵器都歸無用，積極作戰成爲了不可能。今冬蘇聯內陸的氣候條件，和去冬稍爲不同了一些。蘇聯在去年初冬，曾企圖藉氣候條件之助，以擊退德軍；但結果，這嘗試是失敗了。接着，同樣的期待，又放到了今冬。但是，直到今日爲止，戰綫一帶的寒氣比較和緩，飛機，戰車，重砲等的行動，都並無阻障。希特勒在今冬到來時，早已聲明過。德軍對冬季戰的準備，毫無遺漏地完成了。就是說，即使遇到去冬那樣的嚴寒，也有十足的戰勝準備。蘇聯碰見這樣的勁敵，難道有在酷寒下戰勝敵人的把握麼？從結果上說來，我們不得不給予了吾定的答覆。</p>
<p>開戰後一年半間蘇聯的負担和消耗，是非常之大的。迫不得已，就只好乞憐於外力的支援。可惜的是，雷聲大雨點小，被期望的美英的救援，並不是什麼了不起的東西。甚至連自然力的援助，天天焚香祝禱着的酷寒之來襲，也並未如願以償。話雖如此，不知因爲勇敢，抑或無謀之故？紅軍還是執迷不悟地嘗試了冬季反攻。十一月下旬以來，史太林格勒周遭的反攻俄然擴大起來。這一反攻，從市之西北力，南方，西南方，甚至從頓河的彎曲部，差不多同時發動。德軍當局在二十四日的發表中也不得不承認：一挾著多量武器襲來的大兵力，對德軍陣地侵入成功」。、在南力，自史太林格勒之南柯蹇爾尼柯伏以迄於北高加索之泰萊克河，在這一條長綫上，數日前，就開始了反攻。在連結莫斯科和列寗格勒的一綫上，以突破此兩要衡間德軍陣地爲目的，在加里寗西南部，路介夫，伊爾曼湖之南方托洛貝次及威里基挨路基等地點，都試行了猛攻，我們可以說：差不多互全戰綫，開始了反擊作戰。寒氣雖說比往年差得多，但冰點下廿度是常常有的，有時候還加上劇烈的風雪，戰塲上的光景，實在是凄壯之極的。</p>
<p>但，德軍目下已有將反攻擊退之勢。首先在北部，以狙擊兵十二個師團，戰車十四個旅團爲主幹的紅軍部隊，在路介夫被泰擊破，加里寗方　的紅軍也早潰不成軍，在托洛貝決，威里基埃，路基各地點，德軍也把來攻的敵兵完全殲滅了。在最南部戰綫，由于十二月十四日開始的德軍大攻勢，在十六日，紅軍的第一錢也早崩潰了下來，目下德軍正向卡斯皮海和伏爾加河沿岸乘勝追繫中。展開著最急烈的戰鬥的，當然不得算史大林格勒的周圍。統率著義大利，匈牙利，羅馬尼亞各雜色部隊的德軍，不但足够阻擋紅軍的反攻，並且如十五日蘇聯情報局發表的，已使紅軍開始了部分的後退。這樣，紅軍的反攻企圖是完全挫敗了。因此而受到的損失，也非常可觀。</p>
<p>很顯然地，在這决作戰開始的當時，紅軍百腦部作了大大的誤算，史大林在美英軍向法屬北非進出的當時，指出：這進出不能算是蘇聯所期望的第二戰綫。但是，後來，北非戰綫相當牽制了德軍，蘇聯認淸這一點，就採取和北非美英軍相呼應的行動了。不幸，和期望相反，當面的敵人却仍未稍鬆其壓力。現在，蘇聯當局必須加以再吟味的，就是。十一月十七日德國方面的聲明。在那聲明中，德國方面强調，從歐洲戰局的全面看來，重點仍在東部戰錢。卽使北非戰局再行擴大，東部戰錢的德軍作戰，也無所用其憂慮。由這一聲明，今後的德蘇戰局，就可大體決定了吧。（惠譯）</p>

<h3>賴伐爾謀加強　與軸心國合作　四項計劃準備實施　再建軍事將暫延緩</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　据同盟社蘇黎世專電稱、關於達朗被狙事件、因季勞已繼任主席、可以暫吿段落、但因此而暴露英·美兩國意見之不一致及該政權內部粉爭之實情、暨業已引起之各種議論、均已無法使之消滅、預料此後反軸心軍之軍事及政治諸工作、亦必將日益困難、又据某方消息而觀、獲悉法首長賴伐爾頃正按照德·法兩國首腦協議結果、積極從事强化與軸心合作之工作、衆料賴伐爾首長爲鞏固國內體制、將有實施下列諸方策之意向、即（一）於法國國境地帶及海岸地帶、設定面積五十方公里、爲軸心軍佔領地後、卽將使政府還都巴黎、（二）爲復興法國農業將派遣熟練工人及其他勞工赴德國軍需工塲、以交換被德軍俘虜之法國農民、（三）爲將在法國國內結成單一政黨、以强化自身之政治地位、但關於政黨結成問題、傳右派特里奧及馬爾塞達等亦將恢復活動、但觀諸此次德法會談後、德外交部當局曾表明將始終以賴伐爾首長爲對手、於此可知該政黨定將以賴伐爾首長爲首腦、（四）因過去巴黎與維希兩市之報紙與論時生齟齬、此後將由法政府改組各言論機關、以資統一、又據安加拉來電、法軍再建事、因相當繁難複雜、故將暫時延緩、</p>

<h3>大東亞戰爭下　一年來的日本經濟</h3>
<p>在今日的大規模戰爭中、前方軍事勝利的基礎、無疑地是建築在後方的强力經濟之上、一年來的日本戰時經濟、在日政府當局敏捷果敢之施政下、已集中一切的生產力於完成戰爭、又因最高度的統制經濟之推進、全國產業經濟機構亦已完全重新改組、從而確立了必勝經濟體制、</p>
<p>戰爭即建設、這是日本推進戰時經濟的唯一要訣、雖在最巨大的消耗中、也因戰力的不斷增强而克服一切困難、且進而在大東亞全域展開雄偉的廣域經濟建設、堅實的戰時經濟力也就因此愈益增强、</p>
<p>本年四月十四日、日內閣閣議決定的「物資動員計劃」、在戰爭經濟中已訂定了國家有計劃的基本方策、同時又以（一）增强軍備、（二）强化海上運輸力、（三）設定大東亞貿易計劃等爲中心、確立了各種推進計劃、</p>
<p>並編定生活必需品物資動員計劃、在國家計劃中規定了確保國民生活的方策、這是有最重大意義的動員、這更足以表示日本的國家計劃已獲得綜合性的强化、在五月以後、數次閣議中又先後決定「十七年度生產力擴充計劃」、「國民勞務動員計劃」、「交通動員計劃及電力動員計劃」、「生活必需品物資首次動員計劃」等、這些計劃都已隨戰局之發展而逐漸整備完成、至七月十八日、又由閣議決定重要國策、優先編人預算的原則、因此使整個財政便與國家計劃能完全吻合、而預算也就以財政計劃而成國家計劃的根幹了、</p>
<p>其次就統制機構之推移而觀、在開戰之初、日政府即首先決定非常時期金融對策、闡明政府決不採取限制人民提取存款等的非常措置、民心亦因此安定、繼之又召集七十八屆議會、決定敵產管理及其他各種緊急施　、其後在七十九屆議會中、更確立了眞正戰爭體制、創立定前未有的三百億元戰時大預算、同時又決定直接稅大增稅、日本銀行法、戰時金融金庫法、南方開發金庫法、重要物資管理營團法等、此外又決定設立大東亞建設審議會及實施中小商工業之改組等、凡此措置、一年來均已獲得圓滿成果、而奠定了戰時經濟的基礎、此外値得軍視的、就是第八十屆議會決定實施「計畫造船案」、而日本銀行之改組與通貨管理制度之確立及全國金融弘制會之設立等、更進入了金融新體制的另一階段、又在四月一日起實施的合併電力事業、及國家管理海運、設立鐵軌統制會等、在金融交通電力等戰爭設施上、也有了聲實的强化、其次爲了要增强重要產業之生產力起見就依照「重要產葉團體令分別設立統制會、如銅鐵及煤炭　統制會、在大東亞戰爭以前早已成立、其他鑛山水泥·車輛·機械·金屬·工業·貿易·造船等統制會、亦均於一月底分別成立、又如輕金屬、化學工業、橡皮·皮革·油脂·紡織·羊毛·麻等統制會、</p>
<p>至八月四日亦先後組成、至此各種重要產業就確立了有力的統制機構、</p>
<p>這裏必須提出的、是大東亞戰爭的情勢、一方面是長期的持久戰、一方面又是東亞十億民衆存亡所繫的生死戰、所以每個東亞國家經濟力的增强與否、足以直接影饗大東亞戰爭、因此大東亞廣地域經濟的建設是必要的、而在事實上、中滿兩國已早與日本協力合作、同時南方各地復興的進展等、使整個大東亞建設、也在「一面戰爭一面建設」中開始了、這樣自然更使日本的戰時經濟能益臻充實、從而進行十年百年的長期戰、也確信定能獲得最後勝利的、（中央社稿）</p>
<h3>日政府公布　特別財產處理令　定本月二十九日起實施</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　大東亞戰爭發生以來、日　所沒收及管理之英·美等數　在華產業、業經調查完竣、是項特別財產資金特別會計案、已於第八十一屆議會提出、日政府並為急速沽用處理計、特根據敵產管理法、公布臨時別財產處理令、定本月廿九日起實施、茲誌該令大綱如次、（甲）本令所指特別財產爲（一）日本在華沒收之敵產、然戰利品及根據扣留審檢令第廿八條中所規定、凡爲國家之所得物件而經陸軍大臣或海軍大臣認爲軍事上有必要者、不在此限（二）日本在華管理之敵產、而經日本政府收買者、（乙）特別財產由大藏大臣管理之、然有關保管經營或處理現金債券及產權以外之財產等事務、凡爲直接供軍用之財產、則由陸軍大臣或海軍大臣管理、其他財產則大東亞大臣管理之、惟在華有總行或有主要事務所法人之出資者、其議決權不拘於前次規定、而應由大東亞大臣行使之、（丙）日本收買在華敵產之現金、得由大藏大臣保管之、</p>

<h3>考察西北一封信</h3>
<p>××先生：</p>
<p>來蘭已近半月，××××考察團尙未到，一人去各處參觀，收穫反爲不少。</p>
<p>牛瘟問題</p>
<p>昨在蘭州圖醫館閱報室，看到鼎於靑海牛瘟節，情形異常嚴重，因於今日走訪西北防疫院，探知現時防疫悄形，該院規模較大，以前水爲防治獸疫而設。現因軍民需用之疫苗，如霍亂，傷寒，白喉相當迫切，故改作各種疫苗，痘苗，及種種血淸。歷年來作製之量甚多。三十年已達七百萬人份，本年更超過此數。在該院逐室參觀後，再赴西北獸疫防治處，由事務主任導引參觀，該處因係戰後新建設，除一部份儀器由西北防疫院發來外，設備甚簡單，殊不足以應付整個西北獸疫防治之任務。參觀血淸製造室後，入疫苗製作室，即見有四五技術人員解剖一死牛。呆望之下，不知所以，旋經製疫苗主任邢君說明，始知該牛未經免疫，注射牛瘟血毒，一禮拜後，俟其病發將死之際而殺之，取其腹內或腸中已中毒之淋巴錢，再在隔絕空氣之室，用機器磨碎成漿濾過，檢其無他雜菌，即得疫苗，計每頭牛可製疫苗一千至一千五百西西；其血淸之製法，即用免疫性之牛注人牛瘟血毒，使其在牛身體內反應，間二月抽血一次，用作血淸。每頭牛可用二年，抽十二次後，即不能再用。每次可抽製血清三千西西。照上說法，每頭午可以製疫苗一千五百西西。而畜瘟牛一頭，需用十五西西，是每一頭牛之疫苗，可以醫一百頭牛。血淸與疫苗兩種均可醫瘟牛。用血淸時，每次需注射一百二十西西，並需注射三次，即三百六十西西。然一牛一次抽三千西西，共十二次，即（3000×12＝36000c．c．）。每醫一半，需用三百六十西西，故36000/360＝100，仍是一牛只能醫治百頭瘟牛也。現時牛之價（因其只用牛。每頭三百元，換言之，即醫牛一頭，需要三元之疫苗或血淸費。實則有時須兩種兼用，故絕不止此，而一切製造費及薪工皆未計入。現時甘靑兩省，患牛瘟者，已有數縣，據該處邢君言，幾已超過百萬頭，死者恐不止外間所傳之三十萬頭也。姑假定以百萬頭之瘟牛計，每醫治一頭作爲三十元，即需三百萬元？之疫苗費。該處經費每年五十六萬元，每月僅四萬數千元，尙需分撥數千元爲寗夏靑海分隊人員開支，巧婦難爲無米之炊，對此有何辦法？現時固然日夜趕製，然經費不加多，人員一時添不上，各方面函電紛來，要疫苗，要工作人員，所用人昌雖急得內心發跳，有何用處？邢君言時幾至下淚。因工作人員，知其事之嚴重萬分，而其愛又不能推及禽獸，內心實相當痛苦！現每頭牛平均千元，假使死百萬頭，其損失即爲十萬萬元，這是如何大的數字！大家只在表面上做官樣文章一紙書即算了事，該死的是牛，靠牛爲生的也是活該受苦！</p>
<p>救濟西北</p>
<p>余來甘肅後，覺得一般人都在遠遠的喊開發西北，實則與其言開發西北，不如言救濟西北之迫切需要也。上面所舉之牛瘟，固爲眼前擺在面前實事之一，然迄未聞有撥一筆大款或發動所有獸醫人員，從事救濟，救災如救火，緩了是沒有用的呵！</p>
<p>特談畜牧</p>
<p>西北待救濟之事業，最大者無過於水利森林畜牧。只要這三種事業辦得好，西北就是天府了。這三種事業都是舊有的規模，，而且均是只需盡人力，並不靠何種機器，水利森林之救濟，言之甚長，如從略，僅就畜牧言之甘靑寗盛產皮毛，而其來源，不外牛馬羊三大種，牛馬羊之產額，各省無確數，僅甘省略有統計，計牛四十九萬頭，馬八萬八千頭，羊九百十萬頭，驢三十四萬匹，騾十萬匹，然由牛馬驢羊死亡率之高，故皮張出產甚豐，計牛皮每年出產十三萬九千七百十一張，馬皮八千八首五十四張，羊皮：合山羊皮，老羊皮，山羊猾毛，胎羔皮，白小毛，黑紫二毛羔皮，黑紫羔皮，黑白山羊沙皮，白二毛羔羊皮等，共一百六十五萬三千四百八十五張，驢皮千五百八十三張。內牛之死亡率最大，幾爲十分之三，羊十分之一以上。靑海寗夏無統計可尋。此次牛瘟，死亡率之大，可想而知。又牛之死，多由於瘟，而羊之死則多由於凍。</p>
<p>上述甘肅之黒紫二毛羔皮，黑紫羔皮，白二毛羔皮三種，據統計總數計爲六十九萬四千八百八十二張，因羊之交配在春夏之交，而其生育則在冬間，冬季嚴寒，入夜尤甚，羊羣例宿在露天之羊圈中，大家在一圈擁擠取暖。大羊因各個尙可掙扎，小羔羊遂不免受踐踏而死。所有羔羊皮之來源如此，這是何等愴痛的事。尙有一種胎羊，又分死胎與墮胎兩種。死胎出於自然，墮胎出於人爲，因胎羔皮捲曲可愛，似有花紋，望之如行雲流水，外國女人愛用之，其價甚昂。羊商知羊胎將成熟時，即在母羊之腹，猛烈用足踢之，其胎即落。殘暴之舉，聞之嚇人。現外輸甚少，「貿易委員會」極力壓低胎羔價，並禁止之。希望政府將來定出一種法律嚴防戰後此風復漲，防止凍死之法，其事亦非絕對不可能。羊羣大概數十頭圍於一圈內，苟能開導養羊之人，使其在圈周圍及其上予以簡單之遮蓋，或將大小羊分別圈宿，自足减少死亡。至於防治病瘟，則非政府用鉅款製作疫苗血淸不可，農民實無力顧及此也。實則此並非賠本之生意，藏富於民，即是藏富於國，自有取償之處，此爲消極救濟之法。至於積極救濟，則又在於培植草源，此問題更爲複雜，天時，地理，人事，似非兼顧不可。實則天時地理已成為一定之局，靠天靠地卻不可能，還是只有靠盡人事，或者可以人定勝天，而大地回春耳。</p>
<p>培植草木</p>
<p>西北土地，並不是不能生草木，實因氣候較寒，農作物之基幹又不足供炊事之需，而地面下之煤炭缺乏，又無法開掘，只好伐木爲薪。木伐完，則繼之以拔草，往往速根連誅，因之影饗牛羊等畜牲食物，故繁殖之數目低。眼前宜研究何種草木，適於耐旱，再將培植草木之地，作成如四川之梯田，使雨水不致隨坡度橫流，或可爲培植草木之一法，有人以爲西北盡　中積甚厚之黃土層，不似四川之土下係石層，易於蓄水，然無論如何，水浸入土內總比流夫爲佳，尙可以資潤澤也。據近來此地農業改進所之試騐，調苜蓿之根入土深，且能耐早，去年試種後，天早時亦枯黃，旋得秋雨，即轉現靑色，「苜蓿隨天馬」，本漢朝移自西域，今連此日須培，可見人畜摧殘之甚。然茫茫大漢，濯濯之牛山盡是也，夫豈人一手之所能？茍其法之可行，則家喻戶曉，其推行之人又非任勞任怨，視為終身之事業不可。其事固甚難，惟其能如此盡人事，自可變更地利，感召天和，而草木繁茂，牛羊蕃息也。</p>
<p>皮毛前途</p>
<p>甘靑寗三省，一般人均以爲皮與毛最有希望，而開發西北云者，皮與毛富爲第一注目之事。皮之生產，統計固不完全，僅知其極概，而毛之生產，近年統購統銷，其原毛不過二十餘萬担，若洗凈整理，不過十萬担，僅五千噸已耳。其數似甚微末，然假使能培植草源，防治獸疫，及凍斃，其數決不止此。此爲救濟西北事業之較簡單者，官民間之有志西北事業者，請先從此簡單者做起。</p>
<p>拉雜書來，語無倫次。天寒手僵，字跡草率，尙祈諒之。</p>

<h3>中日商會加強機構　合組經濟委會　協力於物價新對策之執行</h3>
<p>最高關係當局爲執行物價對策、在滬另設物價管理局後、本市各種關係工商團體、漸已歸入統制之範圍內、市商會及日本總商會有鑒於此、特聯合組織經濟委員會、擬在物價新對策之執行上、有所協力合作、</p>
<p>經濟委會實施方針</p>
<p>據悉該經濟委員會所擬實行之方針、爲以下數點、（一）加強本市各業同業公會之組織與機構、使關係各業、商店均能加人公會、以發揮統制之力量、（二）與關係當局商治物姿來源之疏通問題、並設法調度船隻、以便運輸、（三）與工部局物姿統制處所屬之公會課、法公董局之物價管理處、與市府所屬之物價機關、密切合作、以便物價統制之機構全面一元化、（四）在物價之審譯與物價之標準上、向關係當局提供意見、以備諮詢、</p>
<p>加強各業公會組織</p>
<p>市商會及其他直屬上級當局、對於各業公會組織素極重視、如發現其機構鬆弛、人事不當者、務須設法予以整理、加強其活動力量、另一方面、復令飭一般商店、加入關係業之公會、以期團結一致、發揮統制力量、協助當局推行物價政策、查全滬同業公會約計三六八單位、其中一四九家向商會登記、目下公會組織已遭解散者、約計四十單位、</p>
<p>各業公會登記情形</p>
<p>工部局物資統制部所屬之公會課、自成立以來、工作進行順利、其設立動機、在於聯絡各業公會協助統制物價及分配物資、目下全市公會中、大多數已向該課登記、共餘限期辦淸登記手續、一候登記竣事、公會課除儘力講通當局與各業問之關係外、如各業本身發生困難時、將接受各該業公會之善意申請、予以審核、並進一步指導各業活動、俾官商兩方相互尋求解決之途徑、該課復擬與各當局保持接觸、疏通貨源、維持物資之供應及公允之分配、</p>
<p>管理對策重點主義</p>
<p>物價對策委員會、由本市各市區當局及日官方代表共同組織之、其基本目標在加強各當局間之聯繫、務使其公允合理、又爲安定民生、努力會行低價政策、但以不妨礙物資暢流爲條件、此外復謀管理對策、採取重點主義、逐漸實行、最近棉紗棉布等之限價、即其佳例之一、</p>
<h3>機匠欲試車　窒息而死</h3>
<p>機匠朱耀卿、會代住辣斐德路、某主顧改裝木炭汽車、迨工作完畢、於昨晚前往某顧主汽車間試車、大概因天寒緣故、渠先將汽車間門關閉、而後燃燒木炭、不久其顧主至汽車間、發覺該處之門緊閉、叩之亦無人應遂掩破之、發現該機匠已橫臥地上、雖立即請人抬赴附近醫院施行急救、但已無生氣、不久即行逝世、</p>
<p>該匠係中木炭毒氣窒息而死、是以居民對於此類機器之危險、千萬予注意、並須十分小心謹愼、以期避免意外發生、</p>
<h3>外埠移入戶口　應辦手續</h3>
<p>兩租界保甲當局、對各該界內居民之遷徙、早有定章、公佈在案、無論移出境外或遷入境內、或界內移動、均須辦理移動手續、領取移動證、即個人之移動亦然、而來自外埠者、倘須常居本埠、則亦須出示移動證、倘無移動證者、則須出示縣民證或居住身份證，否則一概拒絕報人戶口冊而久留界內、至近來由外埠移入本市者、以他項臨時證明文件具報、如在外埠尚未領到縣民證之輩一則報進戶口、頗費手續、</p>
<h3>棉紗從價徵稅　定明年起實行　手續準就緒槪徵百分之五</h3>
<p>關於棉紗及棉紗直接織成品之統稅、過去徵收、向按每公担爲單位、前經財政部提由行政院會議通過、原定本年十一月二十六日起、將棉紗及棉紗直接織成品統稅、一律實行按照當局限價、從價微收百分之五、旋因手續趕辦不及、遂臨時公佈緩期實行、茲悉現改微統稅手續已準備就緒、定於明年一月一日起實行從價徵收、聞財政部稅務署已通飭所屬各稅務機關一體遵照辦理、</p>
<h3>工部局章印圖樣　應徵者頗踴躍</h3>
<p>明年二月廿七日截止</p>
<p>據大美晚報記者昨（廿八）晨探悉、各方應徵工部局徽章、頗爲衆多、惟應微人確數、尙未予以披露、據稱、自十二月十一日開始微求以來、十分踴躍、據某工部局發言人談稱依照原定微求規則、在揭曉之前、應徵人姓名將不予洩露、直至月二十七日截止後、所有評定各項、應徵圖徽、即可公開發表、此項圖標、須適用作上海公共租界工部局旗之中心印章之大小、不得超過能容於一又八分之七英寸見方之面積內、呈送所擬圖樣時、應附送長二十七英寸寬十九英寸之堅硬白紙上、用鉛筆或墨水所繪、照整個印章放大六倍之圖樣、每一應微人、呈送每一圖章時、應各附一封固之素凈信、封外表明其別名、封內開明其姓名地址、</p>
<h3>船舶戰爭　對談</h3>
<p>海軍造船中將　永村清</p>
<p>前東京高等商　船學校校長　須川邦彥</p>
<p>朝日週刋記者</p>
<p>譯自十二月二十七日朝日週刋</p>
<p>又在上次大戰時，他們並不把船在一處的造船廠裏從頭到尾造完全，總是分成許多小部分，分給非專鬥造船的工廠去造。例如把一部交給製書箱的工廠去造，一部交給鐵工廠去造，這樣就把本來不是造船的工廠，也包括攏來而稱之爲造船廠了。他們原來是採用那樣制度的，所以這次大概也是採用那樣制度吧。</p>
<p>記者：造船的技術到了怎樣的程度呢？</p>
<p>永村：相當不錯吧！雖不知道確實情形如何，然拿三萬五千噸的主力艦來說，在軍縮條約取消的第一日，英國就動工來建迭威廉親王號，和喬治五世號。美國則遲至半年以至十個月之後，方始動工建造華盛頓號，和北卡維雷那號。然而竟比英國早半年而完成了。所以不能說他們的造船技衛不行，倒不能不認爲具有相當的能力。</p>
<p>記者：那麼日本非大大努力不可吧！</p>
<p>永村：其一，就是有計畫的造船。那就是決定標準型的意思，原是非常好的。直到現在我們一向是隨意建造着的，所以要上一個軌道，需要相當的時日。不過，不能不使其早上軌道，只喊着努力，努力，是不夠的。那個所謂有計劃的造船的事，自從在報上發表之後，經過了幾個月，才聽見總理大臣用無綫雷廣播說，造船是最重要的事，國民非協力不可的話。第二天，就有報館裏的人到我這裏來問，說是要國民協力，到底應該怎樣做去才好。我回答他說，請認購國家公倩好了，再如你自信自己的體力夠得上，那麼請到造船廠裏揮着鐵錘打鉚釘去吧。這樣說給他聽之後，他才點着頭說，「不錯」，隨即回去了。</p>
<p>日俄戰爭時的艱苦經驗</p>
<p>記者：日本的造船工人，雖說足以誇耀於世，然而還有多多養成的必要吧！</p>
<p>永村：關於建造商船，我雖不大知道。然而就建造軍艦來說，則以爲的確不會比不上世界各國的。何以會發達到這樣地步呢？在日俄戰爭時，開戰到第三個月，一日之閒，我們竟喪失了戰艦二艘，那就是「初瀨」和「八島，」所以那時就不能不設法來謀補充。因爲那兩艦一失，勢力大大的衰落下來了。那時海軍部覺得無論如何，非自大建造不可。不能託付外國。因此，就决定交給吳（日本軍港名）的建造戰艦地方去造。由種種研究，爲使適於當時的造船能力起見，擬先建造最簡單的軍艦，然後再來建造堅固的軍艦，於是「筑波，」和「生駒」二艦，就動工了。等到那二艦迭成時，日俄戰爭已經吿終。然而那二艦的完成，不用說，有着極大的實義。戰爭吿終後，由於戰爭的教訓，在建造上便起了革命。其一，即確立了採用國產品在國內建造的方針。它的結果，我以爲就是促進造艦術的主因。用國產品來造，這句話在現在想來，也沒有什麼大道理。現在已有所謂「國防國家建設，」那樣漂亮的經濟學上的術語。可楚，在明治時代的人，卻不善運用那樣的形容哩。自從下了採用國產品在國內建造的决心之後，便依着那個方針進行。所以在前次世界大戰時，我在英國做監督官，對於造船上的事情，就很少碰到。換句話說，即那時沒有向外國定貨的事。所以那時我每天閒着。可說這是由於日本國內造船技術進步所致。因爲國內進步，遂使我沒有事情可做。故從那時起，日本的造船技衛，已有了相常的進步。</p>
<p>要用國產品來建造，非工業全部發達不可，在軍艦裏，凡爲普通人所認爲工業品的東西，都匯集着。鐵道也有，電車也有，由於它的發達結果，日本才能戰爭。可是，這樣還不能就可安心的，須知人家也在努力研究着。據常到德國去旅行的人說，在日本發明的東西，日本不能用，德國用之卻得到很大的貢獻，原來還有那樣的事呀。</p>
<p>再說日本是由於戰爭的目的來建造軍艦，即所造的是供作戰用的軍艦。然而外國的軍艦，倒並不一定如此。有的被視爲是防衛殖民地的軍艦，因此就依着便利到殖民地去者的生活安樂的目的而來建造軍艦。這樣造成的軍艦也很多。所以，雖然臨到了這次的戰爭，還在頻頻喊着訓練的重要哩。</p>
<p>記者：這話對於商船也說得的吧！</p>
<p>永村：當然囉！　（一續）</p>
<h3>中華慈幼協會　製發貧兒寒衣</h3>
<p>本市中華慈幼協會發起徵募全市貧見寒衣、已募得寒衣捐款四萬餘元、該會於日前招商投標、製辦第一批寒衣二千套、分甲乙丙丁四種、由民生服裝公司得標、計每套平均價格爲二十九元三角、約於兩星期後方可全部製竣、現因大氣日寒、一般貧苦家庭爲子女申請發給寒衣者已有一百餘人、該會已印就請求發給貧兒寒衣表」、凡爲貧童申請發給寒衣者、可逕至該會（愛多亞路中匯大樓二〇八號）索取該項表格、塡明請求人姓名、住址家庭狀祝及見童年齡姓名等、經由正當職業人士或商舖之證明、再經該會派員調查屬實後、發給塞衣、該會爲普遍發衣計、甚盼各界熱心人士合作、隨時注意需要寒衣之兒童、代爲申請發給、</p>
<h3>統制收買棉花後　攙水攙雜標準　規定含水含雜法定標準　收得之花配給紗廠紡紗</h3>
<p>華中棉花統制會爲統一收買及配給棉花起見、劃江浙六產棉區、組織棉業公司、辦理統一收花事宜、今上海浦東南京常太蘇北等公司、均已依照規定限價收購、已收得之棉花、歸公庫按照中日紗廠紗錠多寡配給各工廠、以充增加紗布生產原料之用、</p>
<p>攙水攙雜有一定標準</p>
<p>上海社記者昨向棉業界探悉、統制收買棉花機關、決以全力取締棉花攙水纔雜、（一）本國棉花以含水分百分之十一、含雜質白分之〇·五爲法定標準、（二）本國棉花在市塲買賣、以含水百分之十二、含雜質百分之二爲最高限度、（三）本國棉花所含水分雜質超過最高限度者、禁止買賣、但黃花紅花腳花及廢花、原含雜質較多而不合整理者、不在此限、（四）意圖不法利益、於棉花內攙水攙雜者、決予依法究辦、（五）收買含有水分或雜質超過最高限度之棉花者、停止其使用或轉賣、關於蘇北蘇南杭州寗波南京上海以及四鄉今年棉花均吿豐收、據估計約產二百萬担、自統一收購之後、其收花成績頗佳、所以各紗廠之棉花原料己得接濟、各廠均已準備開足紗錠、增加生產、以維正當需要、</p>
<p>各軋花廠營業極發達</p>
<p>本年度上海·浦東·川沙·奉賢··南滙·靑涌·太倉·常熟·海門·啟東·崇明·南通·等地、棉花均吿豐收、較諸往年、至少多收二成、均七八成產額、故各該區內之花衣壳花籽營業亦頗繁盛、茲據商業社記者探悉、本市近郊及浦東各鄉鎭間所開設之軋花籽廠、為數之多、過於往年、而所軋得之花籽、用於榨製棉油、因目下油價飛漲、棉油銷路、亦甚活絡、至棉籽榨油以後、所剩之渣末、用以製成棉籽餅、今年價格亦鉅、故各軋棉花廠今年均獲厚利、</p>
<h3>滬西保甲委員會　今起調查居民</h3>
<p>滬西保甲指導委昌會前爲求保甲經費公允分擔起見、會發動滬西區工廠商店住戶調查、分甲乙二種、茲悉該會爲求保甲費用分擔更形明確、頃由該會議決通過、修正前訂各項、分工廠商店爲特甲乙三等、住戶爲特甲乙丙四種、茲分誌如下、工廠以職工在五十人以上者爲特等、三十人以上者為甲等、三十人以下者為乙等、商號以三開間門面者爲特等、二開間門面者爲甲等、單開間門面者爲乙等、住戶以租房在三間以上者爲特等、二間者爲甲等、一間者爲乙等、其次則以貧民列爲丙等、並自今日起、由該會派員會同坊公所及聯保辦事處人員四出調查、預期一星期內完成是項調查工作後、再行决定每戶每月應攤之保甲經費、聞是項保甲經費之徵集、將由財政局滬西辦事處辦理、</p>

<h3>清鄉地區辦事處　分區長談話會</h3>
<p>滬淸鄉地區辦事處吳處長、爲明悉淸鄉地區內之實情、藉作今後工作之參考起見、於本月二十五日下午五時、在南滙中山紀念堂舉行分區長談話會、儘量交換意見、頗爲融洽、吳處長於談話席上、對軍民協力一致團結、努力建設鄉里、同時對教育之實施、詳予指示、歷一時餘始吿散會、</p>

<h3>敬告辦理物資統制者</h3>
<p>— 鐵民</p>
<p>自大東亞戰勃發以來，各項物價，莫不飛騰，推其原因，有因奸商囤積操縱使然者，亦有因來源缺乏而暴漲者。就上海　，尤以米麵，棉布，搪油爲甚。近來政府當局，與友邦方面，已注意及此，故各項物姿之統制，次第施行，目日益強化。如棉花收買之統制，棉紗布之限價，與夫米麵糖油之配給等，最近政府又有物價對策委員會，及物價管理會之設，可見各種物資之統制，方興未艾。茲將關於一般統制應行注意事項，敢爲從事此項要政者吿。</p>
<p>（一）中日雙方連絡物資統制，關係重大，在此各地正在淸鄉之時，須與友邦軍政機關速絡，或請協助，或與合作。過去友邦，有單獨爲之者，最近如華中棉花統制會，與杭州，紗布配給會皆雙方合作，足可取法。</p>
<p>（二）官民一體合作，現在經濟統制之制度，多以官民合作爲原則，即物資之生產分配消費等，先由政府樹立大綱，繼由人民自動運營。依此而行，如日本現行統制會皆令人民組織，由政府委讓一部分權限統制會，無異使人民自己統制自己，其效比官廳統制爲強。</p>
<p>（三）收買價格須求適當物資由統制機關收買，此亦統制經濟，不可缺者。惟收買價格，最須審愼，必採取統一原價計算制度，將生產之成本，詳細計算，方能免過高過低之弊，而得適當之價格。又農民生計，最須顧及，一家八口，依此爲活，故農民生活費，必須充分算入在內。</p>
<p>（四）實物　給須求公允物資既經收買，須應人民之需要，而予以配給。惟配給價格，須力求其低，且須充分而公平，如上海現行之計口授糧，與夫搪油限價，確極公允，但事實上尙難充分與普遍，故發生擠買與黑市之惡現象，以後須力除此弊。</p>
<p>（五）統制方案須重生產物資統制，每易只知分配與消費，而忽略生產，故政府樹立統制大綱，必注重生產，即某種物資，應如何加強生產，如改良種植，消除病害，開發荒地，獎勵投資等等是也。</p>
<p>以上僅舉五點，爲物資統制之犖犖大者。他如統制機關之組織須有系統與嚴密，服務人員，須力除官廳習氣，處處予人民以便利，亦不可等閒視之。</p>

<h3>資格</h3>
<p>— 賈生</p>
<p>在一個姿會席上，遇着幾個油頭光臉西裝筆挺的少年。酒酣耳熱，一個意氣不凡的西裝少年，開始間他左右的人的資格。</p>
<p>「老兄，你是不是哥倫比亞？」</p>
<p>「是！是！」</p>
<p>「老兄，你是不是哈佛？」</p>
<p>「不，我是耶魯。」</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>這幾位西裝少年的父兄，有的做過官僚，有的做過軍閥，有的是買辦，有的是地主。他們從小就在國內教會學校讀書。他們現在的資格，有的是博士，有的是碩士，有的是學士。</p>
<p>這幾位博士，碩士，學士的眞實學問如何？到外國留學共花了多少錢？回國後，對國家社會究竟有了些什麼貢獻？這些問題，我們無暇去研究。</p>
<p>我們所研究的，假使這幾位少年的父兄，不是官僚，軍閥，買辦，地主，而是平民或貧民，這幾位少年能不能獲得博士，碩士，學士等資格呢？我想，在這一切商品化的時代，這幾位少年恐怕至多小學或中學畢業，早已要爲經濟所迫，到社會上自己謀生，並賺錢養家活口呢！他們幸而父兄有錢。他們纔能獲得博士等姿格。因此，就使我恍然大悟：</p>
<p>「資格的資，含有資本的意義在內。投下了資本，纔能獲得資格。投下一份資本，獲得一份資格。沒有資本，休想獲得資格。」</p>
<p>國內小學，中學的招生簡章，不是也白紙印着黑字，鄭重說明：繳費後纔得入學嗎？一般平民的子弟連讀小學的資本都沒有，還談什麼博士，碩士，學士？</p>
<p>博士，碩士，學士等姿格，既爲富家子弟用資本躉枇購進或預定了；同時，社會上各機關各公司的用人標準，父以資格的高下為高下；於是富家子弟在母胎裏，已注定是博士，碩士，學士；並且同時已注定是高級職員或董事，經理了。資格，資格，父兄的資本，先天的已决定子弟的資格和命運了。</p>
<p>或許有人說，社會上也有博士，碩士，學士是出身寒苦的；只要肯努力向上，不難獲得什麼獎學金或官費留學。</p>
<p>事實確是有的，不過比例上機會太少了。其獲得的困難，讓已獲得者或企圖獲得者來報吿吧。</p>
<h3>錢的作用</h3>
<p>— 萼生</p>
<p>人類對金錢所起的作用有三：就是賺錢，節錢，和用錢。這三個作用，爲了要說理起見、硬把它們分開來的。實際上，它們彼此連繫得非常密切，是我們經濟社會裏三重大門的鎖鑰。</p>
<p>關於賺錢：一個人若然專事追求錢財，不講廉潔羞恥，不分靑紅皂白，這一種人要算是世界上最可憎最可憐的人了，我們不妨稱他爲「財癡」。不過「悖入」還是要「悖出」的：即使他本身不受其害，也遲早要貽禍於子孫的。</p>
<p>關於節錢：節錢之所以被我們公認爲一種美德，因爲它間接可使社會的消費入於正常；同時還可集多數人之節資，用之於增加整個經濟社會的活動力。直接可以對個人有利，所謂未雨綢繆，逢急用不着向別人央求。</p>
<p>關於用錢：用錢的先決問題，是要金錢本身的意義，因此才可以不事「耗費」而專求「消費」。換句話說；錢財雖然是交換貨物的媒介品，可是所換得貨物的方法以及使用貨物的手段是在要對自己滿足欲望不使社會罹害方面去着想。</p>
<p>以上三個作用之中，祇要有一個在經濟社會中起一次波瀾，　　人類社會便會受到震撼以致於動盪起來。譬如盜賊地痞的偷盜和欺詐，便是反常的賺錢手段；守財奴的斂財如命，不肯從事公益，便是反常的節錢手段；紈袴子弟的揮金如土，便是反常的用錢手段。</p>
<h3>痰盂</h3>
<p>— 紀小裳</p>
<p>一次，我和母舅在車站上候車，閒着無聊，便瞎七搭八的談笑着，借此消遣。</p>
<p>母舅忽然問我：「什麼是痰盂？」</p>
<p>我說：「是一種盛器，供人吐痰的，叫做痰盂。」</p>
<p>母舅又問：「假使一只痰盂，從它在工廠中製造出來起，一直到它破壞爲止，從未盛受過一口痰，是不是也算一只痰盂？」</p>
<p>我不假思索地回答道：「它究竟是一只痰孟。」</p>
<p>母舅笑着說：「它實在不是一只痰盂！」</p>
<p>我仔細想想，才覺得母舅的話是對的，它實在不能算是一只痰盂，我究竟還太笨。</p>
<p>火車就到了，我們便分手了，沒有能再談下去。但是，每當我想起那次談話的時候，心中便覺怦然警惕。</p>
<p>我因此常常反心自問：「我雖然具有了一人」的形體，但是，我究竟具備了做「人」的條件不曾？我是否是一個「人」，一個堂堂正正的『人』呢？」</p>
<h3>社會病的一種——打麻將</h3>
<p>— 達觀</p>
<p>古人的善政，最難得的是「移風易俗」，漢朝文翁的治蜀，能夠使風俗人心化爲良善，所以稱做他循吏，因爲「移風易俗」的效果，就是把社會病治好，而使社會健全。然而談何容易呢！</p>
<p>今日社會病最深而普遍的，要算打麻將的了。不論貧富，不論男女，不論任何階級，大都以打幾圈麻將爲日常的工作。在晚上試到里衖裏去跑，沒有不聽釗劈拍的聲音，習慣成了目然，大家不以爲奇，可見得麻醉在這裏的，比比皆是。我在上年因爲求一種正當娛樂，想買一副圍棋子玩玩，走到邑廟市塲，找了好幾家舖子，買不到一副圍子；可是賣麻將牌的店舖，少說些總有一百來家，而且牌價很貴，由此可以看出社會對於這類東西很是需要的了。</p>
<p>人們在社會上，應該勤勞於事業，麻將的積極有害於事業，姑且不說。拿麻將本身的利害來說，在愛打麻將的人，都認爲一種娛樂的事，可以消遺，可以解憂。假使偶一爲之，原是無傷大雅，可是不斷地幹這玩意兒，久而久之，勝負不必論，而在這賭局上消費的如香烟啦，點心啦，便飯……啦，不是局中人負擔頭錢來使用的嗎？那末錢是只會去不會來的，箇中人想來很瞭解的吧</p>
<p>尤其是牌風不順的時候，正是交了倒霉運，萬分的叫苦。有某詩人因打麻將而自懺，有句云：「尋樂翻罹奇數厄，消閒偏爲失機愁。」把這兩句詩細細地一嚼味兒，覺得所謂「娛樂」，簡直是討苦吃，所謂「消遣」「解憂」，反而變成煩惱，這是何苦，難道除了這勞什子別無樂事可尋嗎？這些打麻將的人們，想來經歷上受過不少的教訓，也未必盡是頭腦糊塗的人，乃沉溺在裏面而毫不叫悔者，實在由於社會病根太深，被環境束縛緊地就難以擺脫所致。</p>
<p>這是社會病，要把整箇社會救治；救治的方法：（一）用集體力量來禁止，倘有故犯，不惜以法律制裁之。（二）用教育方法來感化，使其澈底覺悟，尤應注意社會教育。一面提倡正當娛樂，使業餘者納入正軌。這種流行性社會病倘不根治，將見病茵愈傳愈廣，愈染愈深，人人荒淫於賭博，不勤勞於事業，必然社會的經濟，漸漸地　敝了，道德也漸漸地低落了，不是民族前途的隱憂嗎？</p>
<h3>自信力</h3>
<p>— 海麟</p>
<p>世界上最糟的事便是不信任自己，失去了自信力便是失去了自己最尊貴的財產。</p>
<p>成功的道德是建築在自信力上的，失敗的人往往是爲了不信任自己的力量，才一碰壁立刻回頭，他們不知道發展目信力是一件要受到挫折的事。</p>
<p>有的人只是希望着自信力，而不去建設自信力，建設自信力是一件不能停止片刻的工作，應當每做一件事，經過愼重思考後，立刻要堅定自信力，再勇往直前，假使一旦離開自信力，則工作立刻失敗；毫無異義。</p>
<p>爲了建設自信力，我們必須要把今天的工作做得使自己看得出比昨天更進一步，同時我們能每天看出錯誤而改正，那我們天天是會在進展中，養成活潑有活力的人生。</p>
<p>比建設自信力先一步的是思想，我們要每天建設新的思想和計劃，才能使自信力更堅強更穩固。</p>
<p>這些成功之路上的基石，是每天的工作，同時請記住沒有自信力的人是最糟糕的人。</p>
<h3>觀「秋海棠」後　—六位藝人的結晶</h3>
<p>— 朱楓</p>
<p>看罷「秋海棠」，走出卡爾登，心頭便擁起了一個感想，我覺得今晚我所看到的不是一部戲，而是一幅又華貴，又風雅，又深刻的故事畫，而且這不是用彩色來繪就的，它所用的顏料是腦汁和心血，供給道些腦汁和心血的是六位藝人：原著者秦瘦鷗，編導費穆，佐臨，顧仲彝和演員石揮，沈敏</p>
<p>劇本爲了演出上的便利以及必須顧慮到時間和地位限制等等，當然不能儘跟着小說走，每一部小說改編爲劇本，總得有些變動。例如秋海棠的死，在小說裏是跳樓自殺的，在舞台上則把他演成由於衰病力竭而死在一家京戲院的後台。這是純粹因爲跳樓自殺太單調，並且也不容易演得好，所以才改的，同時死在後台也可以熱鬧些。但就大體而論，劇本的確很忠於原著。</p>
<p>導演費穆佐臨顧仲彝三位，都是話劇界的　輪老手，把全劇處理得精釆白出，只有一兩段穿揷比較生硬些。演員中的石揮沈敏兩位，眞可以說得上無懈可擊，他們的演技簡直已進了化境。</p>
<p>假使勉強要挑剔的話，那就祇有秋海棠在第五幕裏的化裝，滿頭白髮，一臉縐紋，似乎太老了；同時趙玉崑和羅湘綺化裝，卻又嫌太年輕，最好能夠把秋海棠戴的已髮改爲灰白色似乎比較更合理些</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>一二　後庭花</p>
<p>維城這麼一想，連家裏都不敢回去了。晨光熹微裏，漸漸路上有了行人，他想去年今日，把翠珍姊從費長河手裏營救出來：國芳獨自一個，坐了車，從雙橋到了世德堂；那時我雖然新遭大故，心裏究竟是愉快的。不料才隔得一年，已然變化到這個地步。一邊奔，一邊不知不覺奔到了世德堂的北鄉，他舅舅厲又榭的碾米廠廠房，呈顯在他眼前。他走進廠房裏找他舅舅，厲又榭正打算在今天請財神後，高踞在帳桌上。見了維城，喜出望外道：「我正要派人來接你，你倒來了。怎麼的，你衣袖上淌血？」維城扯厲又榭到裏邊的一間屋子裏，說晚上喝醉了酒，和黃龍倆去殺人，人沒殺成，自己倒受了傷。厲又榭詫異着維城不是殺人的人，盤問下去，維城道：「我要借舅舅這裏躱一躱，如果舅舅還當我是個親外甥，請你連舅母都不要吿訴她。」厲又榭滿腹狐疑，不明白他究竟爲了什麼事，追問他，他顚來倒去只是說這幾句話。好在碾米廠新年裏該停工，要停到元宵以後再開工。厲又榭便把維城關在一間深邃的屋子裏，連今天的財神酒，也挪那東邊住宅裏去請。</p>
<p>傍午時分，葉二太太派阿興來問，少爺來過沒有，厲又榭便問阿興什麼事。他沒敢把維城躱在這裏的話吿訴阿興，只安慰了阿興幾句，說：「教二太太放心，一定他們哥兒倆先是賭輸了錢，睡下了，心裏不甘服，說得高興，哥兒倆又去翻本，沒關係。」阿興走了，厲又榭來告訴維城，看維城正扯着褥子裏的棉絮裏在胳膊上。他勸維城回去，維城不肯，一住便是四五天。厲又榭怕葉二太太着急，親自上世德堂去了一回，語氣之間，暗暗透露了一些消良給葉二太太，說：「維城很好，你做嬸娘的不必着急。再過幾天，他自然會回來。不回來，你問我做舅舅的要。」　（二五六）</p>

<h3>Disease, Medicine, and Drugs</h3>
<p>Currently, among the social problems in this city, besides the food problem, the one that most ordinary citizens find difficult to cope with is probably the issue of disease and medical care. According to the habits of ordinary citizens, they do not include the expenses for disease and medical treatment in their household budgets. However, in reality, everyone is inevitably affected by diseases, especially the working class citizens. On the one hand, they have to work harder to barely maintain their livelihoods, leaving them with little ability to care for their health. On the other hand, due to financial difficulties, their daily nutrition is certainly inadequate, and even when they get sick, they avoid seeking medical treatment, dragging on day after day. Thus, the problem of medical care becomes more serious every day. Of course, this is a serious social problem that cannot be fully resolved in a short period. However, we cannot ignore the fact that there are still many man-made undesirable phenomena. The existence of these negative phenomena increases the infinite suffering of citizens and also increases social crises. We must point out these bad phenomena and especially hope that the Public Works Department, the municipal authorities, and the medical community will work together to eliminate them.</p>
<p>First, in terms of medical care, there are quite a few public and private medical institutions in this city, and the number of Chinese and Western doctors is certainly not small. According to general principles, as long as everyone works hard, citizens should not feel too much suffering from seeking medical treatment. However, along with the soaring prices, the fees for diagnosis and treatment also seem to have skyrocketed. Because of the sky-high medical expenses, the majority of citizens feel intimidated by both Chinese and Western doctors, as well as public and private hospitals. Secondly, when it comes to the diagnosis and treatment provided by doctors, one cannot help but worry about the health of the majority of citizens. It is said that many famous Chinese medicine doctors see as many as one or two hundred patients every day. The average diagnosis for each patient is only one or two minutes. To say that they can provide careful diagnosis and treatment in such a short time is truly a myth. This kind of "perfunctory work" by "famous doctors" has not been stopped by society to this day, which cannot be said to be a misfortune for society. Of course, this situation is not limited to Chinese medicine doctors. It is inevitable that a few Western doctors also neglect the diagnosis and treatment of patients.</p>
<p>Second, in terms of medicine, whether it is Chinese or Western pharmacies, in this wave of rising prices, the prices of medicine have also increased accordingly. Therefore, most patients often barely manage to scrape together the medical fees, only to be scared off by the shockingly high cost of medicine. Furthermore, precisely because of the exorbitant prices of medicine, the due morality of a few pharmacists has gradually diminished. As a result, in Chinese medicine, they inevitably cut corners, and in Western medicine, they sell expired drugs as usual. In addition, ordinary non-pharmacists also see the potential for profit in medicine, competing to hoard and counterfeit. As a result, drug prices rise daily, and drug quality deteriorates daily, further jeopardizing the health of millions of citizens.</p>
<p>Some public hospitals and private medical institutions also have "free treatment for the poor and sick" measures in response to the aforementioned phenomena, which is truly commendable. However, on the one hand, the number of such doctors and hospitals is too small, and their power is limited, so they cannot do much to remedy the situation. On the other hand, even with "free treatment for the poor and sick," there are still many areas that need improvement. Not to mention private institutions, even public institutions have many problems with the fees waived for the "poor and sick." Often, the truly impoverished do not receive the benefits of free treatment and are turned away from the hospital. For those who need to be hospitalized, they still have to prepay hundreds of dollars for medical expenses, which is nominally free but not in reality. However, those who are not truly poor and sick, but are introduced by "prominent figures" or have personal connections, can enjoy the "privilege" of free treatment.</p>
<p>We believe that this phenomenon in the medical and pharmaceutical community can no longer be allowed to continue. We hope that the authorities and enthusiastic people in the medical and pharmaceutical community will work together to find ways to improve the situation. We request the Public Works Department and the municipal authorities to allocate more public funds, actively plan to increase and improve public hospitals, and at the same time establish public pharmacies to supply medicines at fair prices, so that the health of ordinary working-class citizens can be guaranteed. These are important steps to eliminate social crises and increase social well-being.</p>
<p>Translation and Commentary</p>
<h3>The German-Soviet Struggle in the Severe Cold - December 22nd Osaka Mainichi Newspaper Editorial</h3>
<p>On the German-Soviet battlefront, the second severe cold has arrived. At this time last winter, an unprecedented cold wave struck the battlefront, rendering the modern weapons of both attacking and defending forces useless, making active combat impossible. The climatic conditions in the Soviet inland this winter are slightly different from last winter. The Soviet Union attempted to use climatic conditions to help repel the German forces in early winter last year; however, this attempt failed. Then, the same expectation was placed on this winter. However, until today, the cold around the battle lines has been relatively mild, and the movement of aircraft, tanks, and heavy artillery has not been hindered. Hitler had already declared when this winter arrived. The German forces' preparations for winter warfare have been completed without any omissions. In other words, even if they encounter the same severe cold as last winter, they are fully prepared to win. Facing such a formidable enemy, does the Soviet Union have the confidence to defeat the enemy in the severe cold? In the end, we must give a negative answer.</p>
<p>The burden and consumption of the Soviet Union in the year and a half since the start of the war has been very large. In desperation, they had no choice but to beg for support from external forces. Unfortunately, the bark is worse than the bite. The expected aid from the United States and Britain is nothing remarkable. Even the aid of natural forces, the bitterly cold weather they have been praying for every day, has not materialized as they wished. Even so, whether out of bravery or recklessness, the Red Army stubbornly tried a winter counter-offensive. Since late November, the counter-offensive around Stalingrad has suddenly expanded. This counter-offensive was launched almost simultaneously from the northwest, south, southwest, and even from the bend of the Don River. The German authorities also had to admit in their announcement on the 24th: "A large force, carrying a large number of weapons, successfully invaded the German positions." In the south, from south of Stalingrad, Kotelnikovo, to the Terek River in the North Caucasus, a counter-offensive began on this long line several days ago. On the line connecting Moscow and Leningrad, with the aim of breaking through the German positions between these two key points, fierce attacks were attempted in the southwest of Kalinin, Rzhev, south of Lake Ilmen, Toropets, and Velikiye Luki. We can say that a counterattack operation has begun on almost the entire battle line. Although the cold is much less severe than in previous years, temperatures of minus 20 degrees Celsius are common, and sometimes there are also violent blizzards. The scene on the battlefield is extremely desolate.</p>
<p>However, the German forces currently have the momentum to repel the counter-offensive. First, in the north, the Red Army units, mainly consisting of twelve sniper divisions and fourteen tank brigades, were defeated at Rzhev. The Red Army in the Kalinin area also collapsed early. In Toropets, Velikiye Luki, and other places, the German forces completely annihilated the attacking enemy troops. On the southernmost battle line, due to the large-scale German offensive that began on December 14, the Red Army's first line had already collapsed by the 16th. Currently, the German forces are taking advantage of the victory to pursue the attack towards the Caspian Sea and the Volga River. The most intense battles are of course taking place around Stalingrad. The German forces, commanding the motley troops of Italy, Hungary, and Romania, are not only sufficient to resist the Red Army's counter-offensive, but, as announced by the Soviet Information Bureau on the 15th, have also caused the Red Army to begin a partial retreat. In this way, the Red Army's counter-offensive attempt has been completely thwarted. The resulting losses are also very considerable.</p>
<p>Obviously, at the beginning of this decisive battle, the top brass of the Red Army made a big miscalculation. Stalin pointed out that the advance of the American and British forces into French North Africa could not be regarded as the second front that the Soviet Union had hoped for. However, later, the North African front significantly restrained the German forces. The Soviet Union recognized this and took action to echo the American and British forces in North Africa. Unfortunately, contrary to expectations, the enemy in front has not loosened its pressure at all. Now, what the Soviet authorities must re-examine is the German statement of November 17. In that statement, the German side emphasized that, from the overall perspective of the European war situation, the focus remains on the Eastern Front. Even if the North African war situation expands further, the German forces' operations on the Eastern Front will not be affected. From this statement, the future German-Soviet war situation can be roughly determined. (Translation by Hui)</p>

After the Prime Minister left, the entire group continued to hold discussions until noon before dispersing.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Qishui Continue to Advance</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th, Central News Agency - According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese army base, after occupying Qishui on the 19th, the Japanese army continued to advance, fiercely attacking about 1,300 guerrilla bandits near Xinshui on the 20th. The bandits were unable to resist and retreated northward. On the 22nd, 300 Chongqing troops were defeated 20 kilometers north of Guangji. On the 24th, 400 Chongqing troops were annihilated 10 kilometers north of Xinshui. On the 25th, a surprise attack was launched near Liangtinghe (25 kilometers north of Susong) on a powerful unit of the 411th Regiment carrying pursuit artillery, which was also defeated. The offensive is still continuing.</p>
<p>Shantou, 27th, Central News Agency - According to the Alliance News Agency, at dawn on the 25th of this month, Japanese troops landed on the coast near Tuolin in eastern Guangdong Province, defeating the Chongqing troops in the area. After fierce fighting to reach Tuolin city, the Chongqing troops were severely damaged. By 3:30 PM that afternoon, the entire area had been occupied, completing the mop-up operations in the border area between Fujian and Guangdong provinces, centered on the area.</p>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Attack Yunnanyi Airport</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th, Central News Agency - According to a dispatch from a certain place on the southern front, announced by the Southern Army Headquarters at 3:00 PM on the 27th, the Japanese Army Air Force launched a surprise attack on the Yunnanyi enemy airfield at around 7:00 PM on the 25th, with the following results: (1) Of the twenty enemy aircraft parked at the airfield, it is confirmed that half were bombed and caught fire. (2) Throughout the operation, enemy ground anti-aircraft fire remained silent, and no enemy aircraft took off to engage. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to base.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th, Central News Agency - According to a dispatch from a certain place, the Japanese Southern Army announced at 3:30 PM on the 28th that Japanese Army Air Force units again attacked Yunnanyi Airfield on the 26th, destroying six Chongqing aircraft on the ground and shooting down seven AD40 Chongqing fighters in aerial combat. Only one of our aircraft has not yet returned to base. Yunnanyi is connected to the Tingkhao and Akulran airfields in eastern India, and is a key communication point for the air transport route to Chongqing and a base for the US Air Force to bomb Burma. This surprise attack has dealt a major blow.</p>

<h3>Heavy Snow Falls on the Eastern Front, Fighting Continues - Six Soviet Offensives Between the Volga River and the Don River Bend Fail to Achieve Success</h3>
<p>Headquarters of the German Leader, 28th, Haitian News Agency - This afternoon's German military report stated that Soviet forces attacking in the Terek area had 59 tanks destroyed. As a result of the fierce bombing by the German, Italian, and Romanian air forces, enemy casualties were very heavy. Soviet forces in the central part of Eastern Europe once attacked German positions without success. Soviet elite troops and tank units southeast of Lake Ilmen, although covered by artillery and tanks, failed to make progress. On the northern front, port facilities in Liepāja Peninsula and Murmansk were heavily bombed by our aircraft.</p>
<p>Berlin, 28th, Haitian News Agency - During the Christmas period, the weather on the Eastern Front was difficult to reduce, averaging between minus 20 and 30 degrees Celsius, with northwest winds howling and rain and snow flying. However, fighting continued as usual. From the 24th to the 26th, the fighting between the Volga River and the Don River Bend was more important. The Soviet Union launched six consecutive offensives, all of which failed to achieve success. The German defenders, with the assistance of the air force, repelled all enemy forces. The German counter-offensive penetrated deep into the enemy rear and destroyed many enemy tanks in the middle reaches of the Don River. The other day, German forces and allied forces launched a joint counter-offensive, forcing the Soviet forces to abandon important positions and retreat.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 27th, Havas News Agency - According to news from the Eastern Front, the Red Army has attempted to take advantage of the cold climate to improve its positions. Therefore, the Red Army General Staff has launched four offensives. First, an offensive was launched near the city of Velikiye Luki, using the area between Toropets and Velikiye Luki as its base. However, near the city of Velikiye Luki, it encountered very strong German defenses. The Red Army's frontal offensive seems to have been crushed. The second offensive saw the Red Army advancing from the city of Velikiye Luki to the city of Ganino (south of the city of Velikiye Luki), attempting to break through the German lines and aiming to recover the railway center of Nevel. However, the Soviet side has remained silent on this move, which apparently did not achieve any progress. Its main offensive occurred in the middle reaches of the Don River. After 11 days of fierce fighting, the Red Army suffered heavy losses, but fresh troops were transferred to the front line to reinforce them, arriving in an endless stream. The Red Army tried several times to break through the German lines, but the location of both sides' positions has not yet been determined. According to German sources, Red Army troops who invaded the German pocket were all annihilated. The third offensive was launched a few days ago, when the Red Army attacked west of the city of Kalach-na-Donu. The Soviet authorities attempted to encircle the German troops fighting in the city, but the German forces near the Volga River number no less than 22 divisions. It is unbelievable that these troops can all be encircled by the Red Army. In addition, the Red Army launched a fourth offensive in the Baksan Valley district of the Caucasus. In short, the achievements made by the Red Army at certain points have no decisive nature. The Red Army General Headquarters has apparently encountered many difficulties. The climate is less favorable to the Red Army than last year, which is one reason. The Red Army also feels a shortage of mechanical equipment, which is the second reason. The Red Army lacks excellent officers, which is the third reason. The Red Army's command opinions are also inconsistent. General Staff Chief Shaposhnikov advocated that the Red Army should launch guerrilla warfare along the German's long lines of communication, while General Timoshenko advocated concentrating mechanized units and cavalry for frontal attacks, which is the fourth reason.</p>
<p>Berlin, 27th, Central News Agency - According to German military sources, German aircraft raided transportation facilities near Moscow on the night of the 26th. A major fire broke out on the railway north of the city. Another squadron attacked the airfield in the area and the highway transportation units northwest of Moscow, achieving considerable results.</p>
<h3>German Forces Consolidate Positions in the Foothills of the Atlas Mountains - US Announces Air Force Losses in Africa - Hull Admits to Major Crisis</h3>
<p>Rome, 28th, Haitian News Agency - This afternoon's Italian military report stated that small-scale offensives by British and American forces in Tunisia were repelled. In aerial combat, German aircraft shot down one enemy multi-engine aircraft. German aircraft again attacked Algiers and Bône yesterday. Enemy aircraft attacked Sfax and one was shot down by anti-aircraft guns.</p>
<p>Berlin, 28th, Haitian News Agency - Berlin expressed deep satisfaction today with the consolidation of the Axis forces' position in Tunisia. After the Axis forces captured Médiéz-el-Bab, 32 kilometers southwest of Tébouba, and its surrounding Allied strongholds, the entire area east of the city is now in the hands of the Axis forces. On Saturday, the German front line advanced westward. Although the American forces occupied strong positions, they did not offer fierce resistance and retreated westward. According to news from central Tunisia, the Axis forces fighting in the eastern foothills of the Atlas Mountains have consolidated their positions to prevent enemy forces from entering the mountainous areas of western Tunisia. Air force activity was very active in the skies over French North Africa on Saturday, with large numbers of aircraft participating in the fighting on both sides. Allied aircraft bombed Bizerte during the day, but were dispersed by German Messerschmitt aircraft before reaching their target and five enemy aircraft were shot down. Haitian News Agency learned that this message detailed that the five aircraft included one four-engine giant bomber and the remaining four aircraft were Spitfire aircraft. After the failed raid on Bizerte, the remaining enemy aircraft flew back to the forward airfield in northern Algeria, but were attacked again by German aircraft. An American long-range transport aircraft and two medium bombers were hit and caught fire. Several aircraft parked on the ground were also damaged by shrapnel. Italian aircraft raided the port of Bône that evening. The port facilities were hit and caught fire. A barracks near Cape Noir was destroyed. Italian torpedo aircraft attacked British and American convoys transporting supplies off the coast of Algeria. One ship was hit and exploded into fragments. When German aircraft raided enemy convoys near Bougie at night, four enemy ships were severely damaged, including a 10,000-ton passenger-cargo ship. Another ship carrying 7,000 tons of cargo was also attacked by air, and the damage was so severe that it could hardly be used again.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 28th, DOMEI News Agency - According to a Washington report, the US Department of the Army announced that since the start of operations in North Africa, British and American forces have lost a total of 114 aircraft, 59 of which were American aircraft.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 27th, Central News Agency - According to a dispatch from Washington, US Secretary of State Hull explained the current situation in North Africa when he met with a group of reporters on the 26th, and pointed out that the anti-Axis countries in the war in that area have a major crisis. The gist of the statement was that although the operations of the anti-Axis forces in North Africa are gradually progressing, they are now at a dangerous stage. Therefore, Commander Eisenhower and his staff are currently doing their best to seek the cooperation of various anti-Axis countries in order to cope with this danger.</p>
<h3>World-Renowned Billionaire Aga Khan Passes Away; Known as the "Living Buddha" of Islam During His Lifetime; Followers Scattered Across East Africa and Central Asia</h3>
<p>Geneva, Switzerland, 27th (Havas News Agency) - The world-renowned billionaire Aga Khan, known as the "Living Buddha" of Islam, passed away today in Lahore, Punjab Province, India, at the age of 65. Aga Khan was born in 1877 and was a descendant of Muhammad. He was the leader of the "Hashshashin" sect, a famous medieval religious group with followers scattered across East Africa, Central Asia, and India. He attended the coronation ceremony of the British monarch in 1902. After World War I, he was listed as a "First-Class Head of State." From 1930 to 1931, he served as the chief representative of India at the London Round Table Conference. From 1932 to 1935, he served as the chief representative of India at the League of Nations. The Khan was also famous in European social circles for his love of horse racing. His horses won the Epsom Derby in 1930, 1935, and 1936. In 1929, he married a common French woman, Garron. He owned a luxurious villa on the French Riviera and often stayed there. On his 60th birthday in 1937, his followers collected a quantity of gold equal to his weight and presented it to him, which he immediately donated to charity.</p>
<h3>Laval Seeks to Strengthen Cooperation with the Axis Powers; Four Plans in Preparation for Implementation; Military Rebuilding to be Temporarily Delayed</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to a Domei News Agency dispatch from Zurich, the assassination of Darlan can be considered temporarily concluded with Giraud's succession as chairman. However, the incident exposed the disagreements between Britain and the United States and the internal strife within the government, as well as the various discussions it has sparked, which cannot be suppressed. It is expected that the military and political efforts of the anti-Axis forces will become increasingly difficult. According to some sources, French leader Laval is actively working to strengthen cooperation with the Axis powers, following the agreement between the leaders of Germany and France. It is expected that Premier Laval intends to implement the following measures to consolidate the domestic system: (1) Designating an area of 50 square kilometers in the French border and coastal areas as occupied territory by the Axis forces, after which the government will return to Paris; (2) Sending skilled workers and other laborers to German military factories to exchange for French farmers captured by the German army, in order to revive French agriculture; (3) Forming a single political party in France to strengthen its political position. However, regarding the formation of the party, it is rumored that right-wing figures such as Trianon and Marcel Déat will also resume activities. However, considering that after the German-French talks, the German Foreign Ministry stated that it would always consider Premier Laval as its counterpart, it is clear that the party will be headed by Premier Laval; (4) Due to past disagreements between newspapers in Paris and Vichy, the French government will reorganize various media organs to unify them. Furthermore, according to a dispatch from Ankara, the rebuilding of the French army will be temporarily delayed due to its considerable difficulty and complexity.</p>
<h3>Judicial and Administrative Conference; Proposals Complete</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) - The National Judicial and Administrative Conference convened by the Ministry of Judicial Administration has received no fewer than 300 proposals from various regions, divided into four groups: (1) Judicial organization and funding; (2) Civil and criminal litigation; (3) Prisons; (4) Judge training and others. These proposals have been completely organized. It is reported that the representatives from North China have been decided as Zu Ze, Zhang Yusheng, Liu Zhiyi, Gui Buji, Qi Yunji, Li Dong, and Li Baohua. Furthermore, representatives from all regions must register no later than the day before the conference (January 10th), it is said.</p>
<h3>Chief of General Staff Kawabe Addresses Foreign Correspondents</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) - Lieutenant General Masazo Kawabe, Chief of General Staff of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, met with a group of foreign correspondents stationed in Nanjing on the 27th and stated that the Expeditionary Force would intensify its operations in order to destroy the Chongqing government and advance together with the National Government towards the goal of completing the war. The main points of his speech are as follows: "I firmly believe that in order to destroy Chongqing, it is essential to unify political and military strategies. When the Greater East Asia War broke out a year ago, Chongqing was quite pleased, believing that final victory was at hand. However, upon seeing the disastrous defeats of Britain and the United States, they were deeply disappointed. Moreover, the Japanese army's operations have destroyed Chongqing's war-making capacity, plunging the Chongqing government into an unprecedented crisis. Today, the lack of equipment for the Chongqing army is becoming increasingly apparent, so their resistance has had to become passive. However, Chongqing's propaganda organs, in order to suppress the general public's war-weariness, are carrying out extensive propaganda, claiming that China's salvation depends on the victory of Britain and the United States. This kind of false propaganda, ignoring the realities of the situation, has failed to have any effect. Regarding the friction between Chongqing and the Communists, Chongqing's desire to invade the Northwest to prevent the expansion of Communist power, as seen in the development of the Northwest route, is clearly to prevent the expansion of the Communist sphere of influence. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government immediately issued a statement, resolving to share weal and woe and cooperate in completing the war, and then launched the New National Movement, expanded the "Qingxiang" (cleansing the countryside) areas, unified the currency, and reorganized the army, etc., in order to strengthen its power. In particular, the reorganization of the army has been progressing smoothly since October, and the strength of the troops has been gradually increased, and the equipment has gradually reached modern standards. At this time when the earth returns to spring and the new year is approaching, the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China will single-mindedly concentrate its efforts on carrying out operations in order to destroy the Chongqing government."</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Decides to Cancel New Year's Holiday</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - Due to the wartime situation, the Japanese government has decided to cancel the year-end and New Year's holidays starting from the 28th. It is planned to hold a cabinet meeting as usual on the 29th, and a regular vice-ministerial meeting will also be held on the 31st. Except for holidays on New Year's Day and the 3rd and 5th, offices will operate as usual on the 2nd, and a regular cabinet meeting will also be held on the 4th. All agencies, from ministers to employees, will follow this procedure.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Economy in the Past Year Under the Greater East Asia War</h3>
<p>In today's large-scale war, the foundation of victory on the front lines undoubtedly rests on a strong economy in the rear. In the past year, under the swift and decisive policies of the Japanese government authorities, Japan's wartime economy has concentrated all productive forces on completing the war. Furthermore, due to the promotion of a highly centralized controlled economy, the national industrial and economic structure has also been completely reorganized, thereby establishing an economic system that is sure to win.</p>
<p>War is construction; this is the only key to Japan's promotion of a wartime economy. Even in the midst of the most enormous consumption, it has overcome all difficulties due to the continuous strengthening of war-making capacity, and has even gone on to carry out a magnificent and broad regional economic construction throughout the Greater East Asia region. Solid wartime economic power has therefore become increasingly enhanced.</p>
<p>The "Materials Mobilization Plan" decided by the Japanese cabinet on April 14th has established the basic national policy for a planned war economy. At the same time, various promotion plans have been established, centering on (1) enhancing military equipment, (2) strengthening maritime transportation capacity, and (3) setting up a Greater East Asia trade plan.</p>
<p>In addition, a materials mobilization plan for daily necessities has been compiled, and policies to ensure the livelihood of the people have been stipulated in the national plan. This is a mobilization of the utmost significance. This further indicates that Japan's national plan has achieved comprehensive strengthening. After May, several cabinet meetings successively decided on the "1942 Productivity Expansion Plan," the "National Labor Mobilization Plan," the "Transportation Mobilization Plan and Electricity Mobilization Plan," and the "First Mobilization Plan for Essential Consumer Goods," etc. These plans have been gradually prepared and completed as the war situation has developed. On July 18th, the cabinet decided on the principle of prioritizing important national policies in the budget, so that the entire fiscal system could be completely aligned with the national plan, and the budget would become the cornerstone of the national plan as a fiscal plan.</p>
<p>Next, looking at the transition of the control mechanism, at the beginning of the war, the Japanese government first decided on financial countermeasures for the emergency period, clarifying that the government would not take emergency measures such as restricting people from withdrawing deposits, which stabilized public morale. Subsequently, the 78th session of the Diet was convened to decide on enemy property management and various other emergency measures. Later, in the 79th session of the Diet, a true war system was established, creating an unprecedented 30 billion yen wartime budget. At the same time, major tax increases on direct taxes, the Bank of Japan Law, the Wartime Finance Corporation Law, the Southern Development Finance Corporation Law, the Important Materials Management Corporation Law, etc., were also decided. In addition, the establishment of the Greater East Asia Construction Deliberation Council and the reorganization of small and medium-sized businesses and industries, etc., were also decided. All of these measures have achieved satisfactory results in the past year, laying the foundation for the wartime economy. In addition, it is worth noting that the 80th session of the Diet decided to implement the "Planned Shipbuilding Program," while the reorganization of the Bank of Japan and the establishment of the currency management system and the National Financial Control Association, etc., have entered another stage of the new financial system. In addition, the merger of the electricity business implemented from April 1st, and the state management of maritime transport, the establishment of the Rail Control Association, etc., have also substantially strengthened financial, transportation, power, and other war facilities. Next, in order to enhance the productive capacity of important industries, control associations were established separately in accordance with the "Important Industry Group Order," such as the Copper, Iron, and Coal Control Association, which had already been established before the Greater East Asia War. Other mining, cement, vehicle, machinery, metal, industrial, trade, shipbuilding, and other control associations were also established separately by the end of January. Control associations such as light metals, chemical industry, rubber, leather, oils and fats, textiles, wool, and hemp were also formed successively by August 4th. By this point, all kinds of important industries had established powerful control mechanisms.</p>
<p>It must be pointed out here that the situation of the Greater East Asia War, on the one hand, is a long-term war of attrition, and on the other hand, it is a life-and-death battle on which the survival of 1 billion people in East Asia depends. Therefore, whether the economic power of each East Asian country is enhanced or not will directly affect the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, the construction of a broad regional economy in Greater East Asia is necessary. In fact, China and Manchukuo have already cooperated with Japan, and the progress of the reconstruction in various parts of the South has also caused the entire Greater East Asia construction to begin in the midst of "war on one hand, construction on the other." This will naturally make Japan's wartime economy more substantial, so that it can carry out a long-term war of ten or a hundred years, and it is certain that it will achieve final victory.

However, the voting rights of investors in legal entities with a head office or principal office in China shall not be subject to the previous regulations and shall be exercised by the Minister of Greater East Asia. (C) Cash from Japan's purchase of enemy property in China may be managed by the Minister of Finance.</p>
<p>Macau Correspondence</p>
<h3>A Letter on Observing the Northwest</h3>
<p>Mr. ××:</p>
<p>I have been in Lanzhou for almost half a month. The ×××× Observation Group has not yet arrived. I have been visiting various places alone and have gained a lot.</p>
<p>The Rinderpest Problem</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the newspaper reading room of the Lanzhou Medical Library, I saw a report that the situation of rinderpest in Qinghai was extremely serious. Therefore, today I visited the Northwest Epidemic Prevention Institute to inquire about the current epidemic prevention situation. The institute is relatively large and was previously established for the prevention and control of animal diseases. Currently, due to the urgent need for vaccines such as cholera, typhoid, and diphtheria for military and civilian use, it has been converted to produce various vaccines, smallpox vaccines, and various sera. The amount produced over the years has been very large. In 1941, it reached 7 million doses, and this year it will exceed this number. After visiting each room in the institute, I went to the Northwest Animal Disease Prevention and Control Center. The director of administrative affairs led me on a tour. Because the center was newly built after the war, the equipment is very simple, except for some instruments sent from the Northwest Epidemic Prevention Institute, which is not sufficient to meet the task of preventing and controlling animal diseases in the entire Northwest. After visiting the serum production room, I entered the vaccine production room and saw four or five technicians dissecting a dead cow. I stared blankly, not knowing what was going on. Then, the vaccine production director, Mr. Xing, explained that the cow had not been immunized and had been injected with rinderpest virus. After a week, when it was about to die from the disease, it was killed, and the infected lymph nodes in its abdomen or intestines were taken. Then, in a room isolated from the air, it was crushed into a paste with a machine, filtered, and checked for other germs, and the vaccine was obtained. It is estimated that each cow can produce 1,000 to 1,500 cc of vaccine. The method of producing serum is to inject rinderpest virus into an immune cow, causing it to react in the cow's body. Blood is drawn once every two months for use as serum. Each cow can be used for two years, and after twelve draws, it can no longer be used. Each time, 3,000 cc of serum can be drawn. According to the above, each cow can produce 1,500 cc of vaccine, and a cow with rinderpest needs 15 cc. Therefore, the vaccine from each cow can treat 100 cows. Both serum and vaccine can treat cows with rinderpest. When using serum, 120 cc needs to be injected each time, and it needs to be injected three times, which is 360 cc. However, a cow can draw 3,000 cc at a time, a total of twelve times, which is (3000 x 12 = 36000 cc). Each treatment requires 360 cc, so 36000/360 = 100, which means that one cow can only treat 100 cows with rinderpest. The current price of a cow (because only cows are used) is 300 yuan per head. In other words, it costs 3 yuan for vaccine or serum to treat one cow. In fact, sometimes both are required, so it is definitely more than this, and all manufacturing costs and wages are not included. Currently, several counties in Gansu and Qinghai provinces are suffering from rinderpest. According to Mr. Xing, it has almost exceeded 1 million heads, and the number of deaths is probably more than the 300,000 heads reported outside. Assuming that there are 1 million cows with rinderpest, and each treatment costs 30 yuan, it would require 3 million yuan in vaccine costs. The center's funding is 560,000 yuan per year, only 40,000 yuan per month, and several thousand yuan still needs to be allocated for the expenses of the Ningxia and Qinghai branch teams. It is difficult for a clever woman to cook without rice. What can be done about this? Currently, they are rushing to produce day and night, but without more funding and without being able to add staff temporarily, letters and telegrams are pouring in from all sides, requesting vaccines and staff. Although the people involved are extremely anxious, what is the use? Mr. Xing almost burst into tears when he said this. Because the staff knows how serious the matter is, but their love cannot be extended to animals, they are really quite pained inside! Currently, the average price of each cow is 1,000 yuan. If 1 million heads die, the loss would be 100 billion yuan. This is such a large number! Everyone is just doing a perfunctory job on the surface, writing a piece of paper and considering the matter closed. It is the cows that are doomed to die, and those who depend on cows for a living are just destined to suffer!</p>
<p>Rescuing the Northwest</p>
<p>After coming to Gansu, I feel that everyone is shouting from afar to develop the Northwest, but in fact, it is more urgent to talk about rescuing the Northwest than to talk about developing it. The rinderpest mentioned above is certainly one of the real issues facing us, but I have not heard of any large sums being allocated or all veterinarians being mobilized to engage in rescue work. Disaster relief is like fighting a fire. Delaying it is useless!</p>
<p>Special Discussion on Animal Husbandry</p>
<p>Among the undertakings that need to be rescued in the Northwest, the largest are water conservancy, forestry, and animal husbandry. As long as these three undertakings are done well, the Northwest will be a land of abundance. These three undertakings are all on an existing scale, and they all only require human effort, and do not rely on any kind of machine. The rescue of water conservancy and forestry is too long to discuss, so I will omit them. Only in terms of animal husbandry, Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia are rich in fur and hides, and their sources are none other than cattle, horses, and sheep. The output of cattle, horses, and sheep is not certain in each province. Only Gansu Province has statistics, with 490,000 head of cattle, 88,000 head of horses, 9.1 million head of sheep, 340,000 donkeys, and 100,000 mules. However, due to the high mortality rate of cattle, horses, donkeys, and sheep, the output of hides and furs is very high. It is estimated that 139,711 cowhides, 8,854 horsehides, and 1,653,485 sheepskins (including goatskins, old sheepskins, goatskin fleece, fetal lambskins, white small wool, black and purple two-wool lambskins, black and purple lambskins, black and white goat sandpaper, and white two-wool lambskins) are produced annually, along with 1,583 donkey skins. The mortality rate of cattle is the highest, almost 3/10, and that of sheep is more than 1/10. Qinghai and Ningxia have no statistics to be found. The high mortality rate of this rinderpest can be imagined. Furthermore, cattle die mostly from plague, while sheep die mostly from freezing.</p>
<p>According to statistics, the total number of black and purple two-wool lambskins, black and purple lambskins, and white two-wool lambskins in Gansu mentioned above is 694,882 pieces. Because sheep mate in the spring and summer, and their births occur in the winter, the winter is severely cold, especially at night. Sheep flocks usually sleep in open-air sheep pens, and everyone crowds together in a circle to keep warm. Because the large sheep can still struggle, the small lambs are inevitably trampled to death. This is how all lambskins originate, which is such a heartbreaking thing. There is also a kind of fetal lamb, which is divided into stillbirths and abortions. Stillbirths occur naturally, and abortions are caused by humans. Because the fetal lambskin is curly and cute, resembling a pattern, it looks like flowing clouds and water. Foreign women love to use it, and its price is very high. When sheep merchants know that a sheep fetus is about to mature, they violently kick the mother sheep's abdomen with their feet, and the fetus falls out. The cruelty of this act is horrifying to hear. Currently, very few are exported. The "Trade Commission" is vigorously suppressing the price of fetal lambskins and prohibiting their export. It is hoped that the government will establish a law in the future to strictly prevent this trend from rising again after the war. The method of preventing death from freezing is not absolutely impossible. Sheep flocks are generally gathered in circles of dozens of heads. If it is possible to guide the sheep herders to provide simple coverings around and above the circle, or to house large and small sheep separately, it would be sufficient to reduce deaths. As for the prevention and control of disease and plague, it is essential that the government use large sums of money to produce vaccines and sera. Farmers are really unable to take this into consideration. In fact, this is not a losing business. Hiding wealth among the people is hiding wealth in the country, and there will naturally be a place to recoup the costs. This is a passive method of relief. As for active relief, it lies in cultivating grass sources, which is a more complex issue. It seems that heaven, geography, and people must be taken into consideration. In fact, heaven and geography have become a fixed situation. Relying on heaven and relying on earth is impossible. It is still only possible to rely on human effort, or perhaps humans can conquer nature, and the earth can return to spring.</p>
<p>Cultivating Vegetation</p>
<p>The land in the Northwest is not incapable of growing vegetation. It is really because the climate is colder, and the stems of crops are not enough to meet the needs of cooking, and there is a lack of coal under the ground, so there is no way to mine it. The only option is to cut down trees for firewood. Once the trees are cut down, they are followed by pulling out grass, often uprooting them, which affects the food of livestock such as cattle and sheep, so the number of offspring is low. Currently, it is appropriate to study what kind of vegetation is suitable for drought resistance, and then make the land for cultivating vegetation into terraced fields like those in Sichuan, so that rainwater will not flow horizontally along the slope. This may be a method for cultivating vegetation. Some people believe that the loess layer in the Northwest is very thick and does not have a stone layer underneath like the soil in Sichuan, which makes it easy to store water. However, in any case, water soaking into the soil is always better than flowing away, and it can still be used to moisturize the soil. According to recent experiments at the local agricultural improvement institute, alfalfa roots penetrate deep into the soil and are drought-resistant. After being planted last year, it also turned yellow during the drought, but it turned green again after the autumn rains. "Alfalfa follows the Heavenly Horse," which was moved from the Western Regions in the Han Dynasty, and now even this needs to be cultivated, which shows the great damage done by humans and animals. However, the vast Han Dynasty and the bare Niu Mountain are all examples of this. How could this be done by one person's hand? If the method is feasible, then everyone will know about it, and the person who promotes it must be willing to work hard and see it as a lifelong career. The matter is very difficult, but only by doing so can we change the geography, attract the harmony of heaven, and make the vegetation flourish and the cattle and sheep multiply.</p>
<p>The Future of Fur and Hides</p>
<p>In Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia, everyone generally believes that fur and hides are the most promising, and that the development of the Northwest is primarily focused on fur and hides. The statistics on the production of hides are not complete, and only the general outline is known. The production of wool has been centrally purchased and sold in recent years, with only over 200,000 dan of raw wool, which is only about 100,000 dan after washing and sorting, or only 5,000 tons. The number seems very small, but if we can cultivate grass sources, prevent and control animal diseases, and prevent death from freezing, the number will definitely be more than this. This is the simpler of the rescue undertakings in the Northwest. Officials and civilians who are interested in the Northwest, please start with this simpler one.</p>
<p>I have written this hastily, and the language is incoherent. My hands are stiff from the cold, and the handwriting is sloppy. I hope you will forgive me.</p>

<h3>After Metered Distribution of Rice, Sugar, and Oil, Supplies Will Also Be Rationed; Implementation Procedures Must Await Overall Planning</h3>
<p>The relevant authorities in Shanghai Municipality have been actively studying thorough solutions to the issue of providing for all food items related to the people's livelihood and suppressing prices in recent months. Measures such as regulating supplies like rice, sugar, and oil based on household registration, and unblocking the flow of sources, are being gradually implemented to make proper remedies. A Central News Agency reporter recently learned from the relevant authorities that the Shanghai Municipal Council's metered rice distribution, which originally stipulated one and a half liters of white rice and one and a half catties of flour per period, will increase the amount of white rice soon, in addition to increasing the sale of flour by two catties per household with tickets in the next period. The metered distribution of sugar and oil in the middle of next month can also be realized. As for other daily necessities, it is said that they will also be subject to a rationing system across the board. After the implementation of the rationing system for all food items needed by the people of Shanghai, the entire plan to control prices can be thoroughly completed.</p>
<h3>Quantity and Price of Rice and Flour for Household Registration Will Change in the Next Period</h3>
<p>The quantity and price of rice and flour for household registration in the two concessions will change in the next period. According to a Datong News Agency reporter, the rice for household registration in the next period will be 1.5 liters of whole rice, selling for 3.8 yuan in reserve currency, and the flour will increase to 2 catties, selling for 4.4 yuan in reserve currency. The flour will increase by half a catty compared to this period, and the selling price will also decrease by more than 1 jiao. Rice shops in the two concessions will begin to receive warehouse receipts from the Rice and Flour Allocation Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council from today, and will pick them up from the Taikoo, China, and Zhejiang Xingye warehouses in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>The Number of Registered Daily Necessities Businesses Is Limited; The Guild Will Be Restored</h3>
<p>The Market of the Cigarette Industry Association previously closed its market because the prices of cigarettes and daily necessities such as matches, soap, and candles were rising in a straight line with no end in sight, fearing that this would lead to interference. Since then, although businesses have been trading with each other, they have only been able to temporarily use the road as a trading place. It is recently learned that the guild authorities have been holding meetings for days to discuss the restoration, and there has been considerable progress. Currently, they have begun to register businesses, and have stipulated that the registration limit is 300, and registration will be stopped after the limit is reached. After the market resumes in the future, only those with registration certificates will be allowed to enter the market to trade, but each business will only be allowed to send one person to the market, so that the number of people in the market will not be too large. At the same time, those requesting registration must provide a letter of application and mutual guarantees, and comply with the market rules during trading, and must not arbitrarily raise prices, causing unrest in the market. It is learned that the guild's market will be officially restored as soon as the registration is completed within days.</p>
<h3>Illegal Radio Receivers: Registration Deadline at Year's End</h3>
<p>The French Concession authorities (regarding the registration of illegal radio receivers) issued a notice stating that the ten-day period stipulated in the first section of the radio receiver registration notice promulgated by this authority on the 24th of this month has expired. The office established at 733 Route Cardinal Mercier has ceased operations. Those who possess illegal radio receivers and have not yet registered are urged to complete their registration before the 31st of this month at the Wireless Radio Management Office, Room 316, Hardoon Building.</p>
<h3>Monetary Affairs: Increased Bill Exchange Last Month</h3>
<p>According to a survey by the Yokohama Specie Bank, the amount of various bill exchanges in November was as follows: (1) The exchange of military scrip between Chinese banks was 332,256,066.98 yuan, an increase of 7,542,925.91 yuan compared to the previous month. (2) The exchange of reserve notes between foreign banks was 1,553,949,681.35 yuan. (3) The exchange of reserve notes between Chinese banks (within the Silver Union Preparatory Committee) was 1,595,061,770.84 yuan, an increase of 184,417,805.98 yuan compared to the previous month. (4) The exchange of agency collection reserve notes was 1,948,645,048.9 yuan, an increase of 108,129,903.6 yuan compared to the previous month. (5) The exchange of reserve notes between native banks was 1,287,865,829.11 yuan, a decrease of 1,898,805.30 yuan compared to the previous month. Observing the aforementioned figures, it can be seen that, except for native banks, the bill exchange amount of other institutions in November increased compared to October, which is likely due to last month being the period for agricultural products to enter the market.</p>
<h3>Group A Oil Shops to Continue Sales Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office and the Edible Oil Trade Wholesale Office, in order to eliminate private profiteering and ensure the supply of legitimate food consumers, with the permission of the military allocation authorities, are preparing to distribute sugar and oil based on a per capita basis. The specific measures have been drafted and will be implemented in the same manner as the authorities' per capita grain distribution method. It is reported that the per capita method will be based on the household registration books of the baojia system, and the Lianbao chiefs of each district will be asked to assist in the process. Each district will designate a number of registered retailers to sell sugar and oil. Residents will purchase based on "purchase certificates" issued in advance. Sugar and oil will be distributed once or several times per month. The quantity to be distributed per capita is still under discussion and research. An official announcement will be made and implemented after a complete decision is made and all preparations are completed. However, the date is expected to be in the spring of next year. If the per capita distribution system is implemented, queuing to press sugar and oil will become a historical relic.</p>
<p>Group A Leaders to Begin Sales Tomorrow</p>
<p>Before the implementation of per capita oil distribution, the Edible Oil Trade Wholesale Office will temporarily sell oil according to the previous free purchase system and will combine the city's 1,830 establishments into two groups, A and B. After the allocated ten-day oil supply for each group is sold out within the specified time limit, Group A has already sold out on the 25th of this month, and Group B will sell from the 26th until today. In order to continue selling edible oil to maintain the needs of the citizens, it has been decided to allocate another ten-day supply of oil to both Group A and Group B, totaling 10,300 piculs, to be sold out within five days.</p>
<p>Limit of One City Jin of Oil per Person</p>
<p>The retailers of Group A have already paid and collected the edible oil from the designated oil distribution agents yesterday. Sales will begin tomorrow (30th) and last until January 5th, except for New Year's Day, which is a holiday. The oil to be sold is soybean oil purchased from Dalian and self-extracted from local oil factories. The price is 7.10 yuan per city jin, including the barrel. The quantity is uniformly set at one city jin because the allocated quantity is sufficient and there is no need to further divide it into one city jin and half a city jin. Group B will begin sales after Group A is sold out, from January 6th to the 10th.</p>
<p>Eight Arrested for Altering Donation Tickets</p>
<p>Due to the shortage of sugar supply in this port, the authorities notified all shops to restrict purchases to those with donation tickets and house tickets from September and October. Unexpectedly, unscrupulous individuals forged house donation tickets and altered them. Hua An Sheng, residing at 58 Ningxing Street; Ye Chuanxin, residing at 47 Rue des Soeurs; Hu Heshang, residing at 61, Lane 74, Rue des Soeurs; Lu Rongtao, residing at 65, Lane 60, Rue de l'Est de la Centrale Electrique; Zhu Yangshi, residing at 45 Rue de l'Est de la Centrale Electrique; Shen Guanlin, residing at 52, Lane 74, Rue des Soeurs; Liu Caishi, residing at 51 Rue des Soeurs; and Li Yinglong, residing at 248 Route Tenant de la Tour; a total of eight individuals, altered old donation tickets to make them appear as September and October donation tickets in order to purchase sugar from various sugar shops. After being discovered, the above individuals were arrested and taken to the police station. Yesterday, they were brought before the First Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. The police lawyer presented the facts of the case and requested that the defendants be prosecuted for forgery and fraud. The defendants admitted to the alterations. The court ordered them to post bail and set a date for sentencing.</p>
<h3>Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama of the Japanese Army Press Department Promoted</h3>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama, head of the Shanghai Japanese Army Press Department, has been reassigned as a local unit commander. The order was issued on the 24th. Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama has been in office since June of this year, for about half a year, and has spared no effort in his press work in Shanghai, an important base during the Greater East Asia War. All parties expressed their regret at his promotion to another position.</p>
<h3>Economize to Help Students</h3>
<p>Based on compassion, Mr. Shen Huangjun voluntarily economized and happily donated 1,000 yuan to the scholarship fund for readers of this newspaper yesterday. In addition, Miss Liu Tongyuan's daughter's one-month anniversary celebration resulted in a donation of 290 yuan from relatives and friends (Liu Facai 80 yuan, Liu Chuqing 80 yuan, Liu Linfu 40 yuan, Sheng Zhiheng 90 yuan). Additionally, He Yuqin contributed 47 yuan. The balance is 100,087.80 yuan, 0.12 jiao.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Market Prices: Wholesale and Retail Indices</h3>
<p>The Customs Tariff Commission recently announced that the general wholesale price index for Shanghai in October of this year was 3043.85, an increase of 108.16 compared to 2935.69 in September. A comparison of the Shanghai retail price index from January to October of this year is provided below to show the changes in the prices of general consumer goods:</p>

<h3>Sino-Japanese Chamber of Commerce Strengthens Organization, Jointly Forms Economic Committee, Cooperates in Implementing New Price Control Measures</h3>
<p>After the highest relevant authorities established a Price Control Bureau in Shanghai to implement price control measures, various relevant industrial and commercial organizations in this city have gradually fallen under the scope of control. In view of this, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Japanese Chamber of Commerce have jointly organized an Economic Committee to cooperate in the implementation of new price control measures.</p>
<p>Implementation Guidelines of the Economic Committee</p>
<p>It is understood that the implementation guidelines proposed by the Economic Committee are as follows: (1) Strengthen the organization and structure of various trade associations in the city to ensure that relevant industries and shops can join the associations to exert the power of control. (2) Discuss with the relevant authorities the issue of unblocking the sources of supplies and devise methods to allocate ships for transportation. (3) Closely cooperate with the association section under the Materials Control Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Price Management Office of the French Municipal Council, and the price control agencies under the Municipal Government to comprehensively unify the price control mechanism. (4) Provide opinions to the relevant authorities on price review and price standards for consultation.</p>
<p>Strengthen Organization of Various Trade Associations</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and other directly subordinate superior authorities have always attached great importance to the organization of various trade associations. If their organization is found to be lax or the personnel are inappropriate, measures must be taken to reorganize them and strengthen their activities. On the other hand, general shops are ordered to join the trade association of the relevant industry in order to unite and exert the power of control to assist the authorities in promoting price policies. It is found that there are approximately 368 trade associations in Shanghai, of which 149 are registered with the Chamber of Commerce. Currently, approximately 40 trade associations have been dissolved.</p>
<p>Registration Status of Various Trade Associations</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the association section under the Materials Control Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council has been progressing smoothly. Its motivation lies in contacting various trade associations to assist in controlling prices and allocating materials. Currently, most of the associations in the city have registered with the section. The remaining ones are required to complete the registration procedures within a limited time. After the registration is completed, in addition to making every effort to communicate between the authorities and various industries, the association section will accept the good-faith applications of various industries when they encounter difficulties, review them, and further guide the activities of various industries to enable officials and merchants to jointly seek solutions. The section also plans to maintain contact with various authorities to dredge supply sources and maintain the supply and fair distribution of materials.</p>
<p>Management Countermeasures Emphasize Key Points</p>
<p>The Price Control Countermeasures Committee is jointly organized by the city district authorities and Japanese official representatives in this city. Its basic goal is to strengthen the connection between the authorities, to make them fair and reasonable, and to strive to implement low-price policies for the sake of stabilizing people's livelihood, but on the condition that the smooth flow of materials is not hindered. In addition, management countermeasures are planned and implemented gradually, taking the principle of focusing on key points. The recent price limits on cotton yarn and cotton cloth are one of the best examples.</p>
<h3>Mechanic Suffocates While Trying to Test Car</h3>
<p>Zhu Yaoqing, a mechanic, had been residing on Route Lafayette. He had been modifying a charcoal-powered car for a client. After the work was completed, he went to the client's garage last night to test the car. Presumably because of the cold weather, he first closed the door of the garage and then burned the charcoal. Soon after, his client arrived at the garage and found the door tightly closed. There was no response to knocking. He broke in and found the mechanic lying on the ground. He immediately asked someone to take him to a nearby hospital for emergency treatment, but he was already lifeless and soon passed away.</p>
<p>The mechanic died of asphyxiation from charcoal gas poisoning. Therefore, residents should pay attention to the dangers of such machines and be very careful to avoid accidents.</p>
<h3>Procedures for Population Moving in from Other Areas</h3>
<p>The Baojia authorities of the two concessions have long had regulations regarding the movement of residents within their respective boundaries, which have been published. Whether moving out of the area, moving into the area, or moving within the area, it is necessary to complete the movement procedures and obtain a movement certificate, even for individual movements. Those who come from other areas and need to reside permanently in this port must also present a movement certificate. Those who do not have a movement certificate must present a county resident certificate or a residential identification card; otherwise, they will be refused registration in the household register and long-term residence within the area. Recently, those who have moved into this city from other areas have submitted other temporary proof documents for registration, such as those who have not yet received a county resident certificate in other areas, which makes the registration process difficult.</p>
<h3>Tax Collection on Cotton Yarn Based on Price to Be Implemented Starting Next Year; Procedures Ready, Generally 5% to Be Collected</h3>
<p>Regarding the unified tax on cotton yarn and direct cotton yarn woven goods, the previous collection was based on a per dan unit. The Ministry of Finance submitted it to the Executive Yuan meeting, which was passed. Originally, it was scheduled to start on November 26th of this year, and the unified tax on cotton yarn and direct cotton yarn woven goods was to be collected at a rate of 5% based on the official price limit. However, due to the rush in completing the procedures, a temporary announcement was made to postpone the implementation. It is now learned that the procedures for collecting the unified tax have been prepared, and the implementation of collecting based on price will start on January 1st of next year. It is reported that the Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance has issued instructions to all its affiliated tax agencies to comply.</p>
<h3>Many Applicants for Design of Shanghai Municipal Council Seal</h3>
<p>Deadline February 27th Next Year</p>
<p>According to a reporter from the Shanghai Evening Post this morning (28th), there are many applicants for the design of the Shanghai Municipal Council emblem. However, the exact number of applicants has not been disclosed. It is said that since the solicitation began on December 11th, it has been very enthusiastic. According to a Municipal Council spokesperson, in accordance with the original solicitation rules, the names of the applicants will not be disclosed before the announcement. After the deadline of February 27th, all evaluated entries will be made public. This emblem must be suitable for use as the central seal of the Shanghai International Settlement flag, not exceeding an area of 1 and 7/8 inches square. When submitting the proposed design, a drawing enlarged six times the size of the entire seal should be attached on a hard white paper measuring 27 inches long and 19 inches wide, drawn in pencil or ink. Each applicant should attach a sealed plain envelope with each submitted seal, indicating their pseudonym on the outside and their name and address inside.</p>
<h3>Talk on Naval Warfare</h3>
<p>Vice Admiral of Naval Shipbuilding Kiyoshi Nagamura</p>
<p>Former Principal of Tokyo Higher Mercantile Marine School Kunihiko Sugawa</p>
<p>Reporter of Asahi Weekly</p>
<p>Translated from Asahi Weekly, December 27th</p>
<p>Also, during the last Great War, they did not build the ships completely from beginning to end in one shipyard; instead, they divided them into many small parts and gave them to factories that were not specialized in shipbuilding. For example, they gave one part to a box-making factory and another part to an iron factory. In this way, factories that were not originally shipbuilding factories were also included and called shipyards. They originally adopted that system, so they will probably adopt that system again this time.</p>
<p>Reporter: To what extent has shipbuilding technology advanced?</p>
<p>Nagamura: It's quite good! Although I don't know the exact situation, let's take the 35,000-ton battleships as an example. On the first day the naval disarmament treaty was lifted, Britain started building the Prince of Wales and King George V. The United States started building the Washington and North Carolina six to ten months later. However, they completed them six months earlier than Britain. Therefore, it cannot be said that their shipbuilding technology is not good; on the contrary, it must be recognized that they have considerable capabilities.</p>
<p>Reporter: Then Japan must make great efforts!</p>
<p>Nagamura: One is planned shipbuilding. That is, deciding on a standard type is very good. Until now, we have been building arbitrarily, so it will take considerable time to get on the right track. However, it is not enough to just shout "Effort, effort!" We must get on the right track as soon as possible. The so-called planned shipbuilding matter was announced in the newspaper several months ago, and then I heard the Prime Minister say on the radio that shipbuilding is the most important thing and that the people must cooperate. The next day, people from the newspaper came to me and asked how the people should cooperate. I replied that they should buy national bonds. Furthermore, if you are confident that your physical strength is sufficient, then go to the shipyard and swing the hammer to rivet. After telling him this, he nodded and said, "That's right," and then left.</p>
<p>The Bitter Experience of the Russo-Japanese War</p>
<p>Reporter: Although Japan's shipbuilding workers can be boasted of to the world, there is still a need to cultivate more.</p>
<p>Nagamura: Regarding the construction of merchant ships, I don't know much. However, as for the construction of warships, I believe that we are indeed not inferior to any country in the world. How did we develop to this point? During the Russo-Japanese War, in the third month after the start of the war, we lost two battleships in one day, namely the Hatsuse and the Yashima, so we had to find a way to replenish them. Because the loss of those two ships greatly weakened our strength. At that time, the Navy Department felt that we had to build them ourselves, no matter what. We could not entrust them to foreign countries. Therefore, it was decided to hand them over to the Kure (Japanese naval port name) warship construction site to build. After various studies, in order to suit the shipbuilding capabilities at that time, it was proposed to first build the simplest warships and then build solid warships. Thus, the Tsukuba and Ikoma were started. By the time those two ships were completed, the Russo-Japanese War had already ended. However, the completion of those two ships, needless to say, had great practical significance. After the war ended, a revolution occurred in construction due to the lessons of the war. One was the establishment of a policy of using domestic products to build domestically. As a result, I believe it was the main reason for promoting shipbuilding technology. Building with domestic products, this phrase may not make much sense now. Now there are such beautiful economic terms as "National Defense National Construction." However, people in the Meiji era were not good at using such descriptions. After making the determination to use domestic products to build domestically, we proceeded according to that policy. Therefore, during the last World War, I was a supervisor in England, and I rarely encountered things related to shipbuilding. In other words, there were no orders placed with foreign countries at that time. So I was idle every day. This can be said to be due to the progress of shipbuilding technology in Japan. Because of the progress in the country, I had nothing to do. Therefore, from that time on, Japan's shipbuilding technology has made considerable progress.</p>
<p>To build with domestic products, the entire industry must be developed. In warships, everything that ordinary people consider industrial products is gathered. There are railways and streetcars. As a result of its development, Japan was able to wage war. However, we cannot rest assured with this. We must know that other people are also working hard on research. According to people who often travel to Germany, things invented in Japan cannot be used by Japan, but Germany uses them to make great contributions. There are such things.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Japan builds warships for the purpose of war, that is, what we build are warships for combat. However, foreign warships are not necessarily so. Some are regarded as warships for defending colonies, so they are built for the purpose of facilitating the lives of those who go to the colonies. There are many warships built in this way. Therefore, even now that the war has arrived, the importance of training is still being shouted repeatedly.</p>
<p>Reporter: Does this apply to merchant ships as well?</p>
<p>Nagamura: Of course! (To be continued)</p>
<h3>China Philanthropic Children's Association Makes and Distributes Winter Clothing for Poor Children</h3>
<p>The Shanghai China Philanthropic Children's Association initiated a fundraising campaign to collect winter clothing for poor children throughout the city and has raised over 40,000 yuan in winter clothing donations. The association recently invited businesses to bid for the production of the first batch of 2,000 sets of winter clothing, divided into four types: A, B, C, and D. The Min Sheng Clothing Company won the bid, with an average price of 29.30 yuan per set, which will be completed in about two weeks. Currently, due to the increasingly cold weather, more than 100 poor families have applied for winter clothing for their children. The association has printed a "Request for Winter Clothing for Poor Children Form." Those who wish to apply for winter clothing for poor children can go directly to the association (Room 208, Chung Wai Building, Avenue Edward VII) to obtain the form, fill in the applicant's name, address, family situation, and the child's age and name, with certification from a legitimate professional or shop. After the association sends personnel to investigate and verify the information, the clothing will be distributed. In order to distribute the clothing widely, the association hopes that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will cooperate, pay attention to children in need of winter clothing at any time, and apply for them on their behalf.</p>
<h3>After Unified Purchase of Cotton, Standards for Adulteration with Water and Impurities Specified, Legal Standards for Water and Impurity Content Set, Cotton Collected Allocated to Yarn Factories for Spinning</h3>
<p>In order to unify the purchase and allocation of cotton, the Central China Cotton Control Association has divided the six cotton-producing areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, organized cotton industry companies, and handled the unified cotton purchase matters. Now, the Shanghai Pudong, Nanjing, Changzhou, Taizhou, and Northern Jiangsu companies have all purchased cotton according to the specified price limits. The collected cotton will be put into the public treasury and allocated to various factories according to the number of spindles in Chinese and Japanese yarn factories to supplement the raw materials for increasing the production of yarn and cloth.</p>
<p>Fixed Standards for Adulteration with Water and Impurities</p>
<p>A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency learned from the cotton industry yesterday that the cotton purchase control authorities are determined to do their best to ban cotton adulteration with water and impurities. (1) The legal standard for domestic cotton is a water content of 11% and an impurity content of 0.5%. (2) The maximum limit for domestic cotton bought and sold in the market is a water content of 12% and an impurity content of 2%. (3) Domestic cotton with a water and impurity content exceeding the maximum limit is prohibited from being bought and sold. However, yellow cotton, red cotton, foot cotton, and waste cotton, which originally contain more impurities and are not suitable for sorting, are not subject to this restriction. (4) Those who intend to obtain illegal profits by adulterating cotton with water and impurities will be investigated and dealt with according to the law. (5) Those who purchase cotton with a water or impurity content exceeding the maximum limit will be suspended from use or resale. This year's cotton in Northern Jiangsu, Southern Jiangsu, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Nanjing, Shanghai, and the surrounding areas has been harvested in abundance. It is estimated that it will produce approximately 2 million piculs. Since the unified purchase, the results of the cotton collection have been quite good, so the cotton raw materials of various yarn factories have been supplied, and the factories are all prepared to open their spindles to increase production and maintain legitimate needs.</p>
<p>The Business of Various Cotton Ginning Factories is Extremely Developed</p>
<p>This year, cotton has been harvested in abundance in Shanghai, Pudong, Chuansha, Fengxian, Nanhui, Qingpu, Taicang, Changshu, Haimen, Qidong, Chongming, Nantong, and other places, at least 20% more than in previous years, with an output of 70% to 80%. Therefore, the business of flower clothing, shell flowers, and seeds in these areas is also quite prosperous. According to a reporter from the Commercial News Agency, the number of cotton ginning factories opened in the suburbs of this city and various towns in Pudong is more than in previous years, and the ginned seeds are used to extract cotton oil. Because the price of oil is soaring, the sales of cotton oil are also very active. As for the residue left after the cottonseeds are pressed for oil, it is used to make cottonseed cake, and the price this year is also high. Therefore, various cotton ginning factories have made huge profits this year.</p>
<h3>Shanghai West Baojia Committee to Investigate Residents Starting Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai West Baojia Guidance Committee previously launched an investigation of factories, shops, and households in the Shanghai West district in order to fairly share the Baojia expenses, divided into two types, A and B. It is learned that in order to make the Baojia expense sharing more precise, the committee recently resolved and passed a revision of the previously set items, dividing factories and shops into three classes: special A, B, and C, and dividing households into four types: special A, B, C, and D. The details are as follows: Factories with 50 or more employees are classified as special, those with 30 or more employees are classified as A, and those with fewer than 30 employees are classified as B. Shops with three-bay storefronts are classified as special, those with two-bay storefronts are classified as A, and those with single-bay storefronts are classified as B. Households renting three or more rooms are classified as special, those with two rooms are classified as A, those with one room are classified as B, and the poor are classified as C. Starting today, the committee will send personnel to conduct investigations with the Fang Gong Suo and Lianbao Office personnel. After completing the investigation within one week, the Baojia expenses to be allocated to each household per month will be determined. It is reported that the collection of these Baojia expenses will be handled by the Shanghai West Office of the Finance Bureau.</p>
<h3>MacTaggart Road Road Repairs, Vehicles Stop Traffic</h3>
<p>Pedestrians Only Allowed from South to North</p>
<p>Due to the disrepair and depression of the road surface on MacTaggart Road in the Public Concession, from the Xin Zha Road intersection to Connaught Road, the Shanghai Municipal Council has ordered the Public Works Department to carry out large-scale repairs. Because the project is huge, vehicles are absolutely prohibited from traveling on this section of the road. Even pedestrians are only allowed to travel one way from south to north.</p>
<h3>Talks with Sub-District Chiefs at the Shanghai Clearing Area Office</h3>
<p>In order to understand the actual situation in the clearing area and use it as a reference for future work, Wu, the director of the Shanghai Clearing Area Office, held a meeting with sub-district chiefs at the Nanhui Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall at 5:00 pm on the 25th of this month, exchanging opinions as much as possible, which was quite harmonious. At the meeting, Director Wu gave detailed instructions on the joint efforts of the military and civilians to unite and work hard to build the countryside, as well as the implementation of education. The meeting adjourned after more than an hour.</p>
<h3>Group Worship Held on New Year's Day</h3>

<h3>A Respectful Announcement to Those Managing Commodity Control</h3>
<p>— Tie Min</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the prices of all commodities have soared. The reasons for this include hoarding and manipulation by unscrupulous merchants, as well as sharp increases due to a lack of supply. In Shanghai, this is especially evident in the prices of rice, flour, cotton cloth, and enamelware. Recently, the government authorities and friendly nations have paid attention to this issue, and the control of various commodities has been gradually implemented and is becoming increasingly strengthened. For example, the control of cotton purchases, the price limits on cotton yarn and cloth, and the rationing of rice, flour, sugar, and enamelware. Recently, the government has also established a Commodity Price Countermeasures Committee and a Commodity Price Management Committee, indicating that the control of various commodities is in full swing. I would like to offer the following advice to those engaged in this important political task regarding general control matters that should be noted.</p>
<p>(1) Sino-Japanese cooperation in commodity control is of great importance. At a time when various regions are being cleared and pacified, it is necessary to quickly establish contact with the military and political organs of friendly nations, or to request assistance, or to cooperate with them. In the past, some friendly nations acted independently. More recently, the Central China Cotton Control Association and the Hangzhou Yarn and Cloth Rationing Association have both cooperated, which is a good example to follow.</p>
<p>(2) Government and the people should cooperate as one. The current economic control system is mostly based on the principle of cooperation between government and the people. This means that the government first establishes a general outline for the production, distribution, and consumption of commodities, and then the people operate it autonomously. Following this model, the current control associations in Japan are all organized by the people, and the government delegates a portion of its authority to the control associations. This is tantamount to the people controlling themselves, which is more effective than control by government agencies.</p>
<p>(3) Purchase prices must be appropriate. The purchase of commodities by control organizations is also an indispensable part of a controlled economy. However, the purchase prices must be carefully considered, and a unified original cost calculation system must be adopted. The cost of production must be calculated in detail in order to avoid the drawbacks of prices being too high or too low, and to arrive at appropriate prices. Furthermore, the livelihood of farmers must be given the utmost consideration. A family of eight depends on this for their livelihood, so the living expenses of farmers must be fully taken into account.</p>
<p>(4) In-kind distribution must be fair. Once commodities have been purchased, they must be distributed to the people according to their needs. However, the distribution prices must be kept as low as possible, and they must be sufficient and fair. For example, the current system of grain distribution per capita and the price limits on enamelware in Shanghai are indeed very fair, but in reality, it is still difficult to achieve sufficiency and universality, which has led to the undesirable phenomena of panic buying and black markets. This drawback must be eliminated in the future.</p>
<p>(5) Control plans must emphasize production. Commodity control often only focuses on distribution and consumption, while neglecting production. Therefore, the government must emphasize production when establishing a general outline for control. This means considering how to strengthen the production of certain commodities, such as improving planting methods, eliminating diseases, developing wasteland, and encouraging investment.</p>
<p>The above are just five points, which are the most important aspects of commodity control. Other aspects, such as ensuring that the organization of control agencies is systematic and well-organized, and that service personnel eliminate bureaucratic habits and provide convenience to the people in all aspects, should also not be taken lightly.</p>

<h3>Cotton Cloth Sales Quotes Higher, Especially for Dong Bu</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market was active with street sales, and goods remained tight. Sales quotes in various markets were again raised, but there were not many transactions. 16-pound Earth brand coarse cloth was 290 yuan, 14-pound Earth was 245 yuan, 9-pound New Character was 145 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong was 140 yuan, 12-pound Earth brand fine cloth was 196 yuan. The same poundage of Dapeng Fugui was also quoted at 195 to 196 yuan, an increase of about 1.5 yuan compared to last week. Peach Blossom Lady Lin was transacted at 317.5 yuan in the morning and 319 yuan in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Dong Bu: Market sentiment was high again. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at 200.5 yuan, and Trumpet Five Blessings fine cloth was also priced at around 200 yuan. Four Gentlemen broadcloth opened at 8 yuan for red orders, fell back to 7.93 yuan, but at noon closing, demand exceeded supply, and transactions were made at 8.05 yuan, an increase of 0.11 yuan.</p>
<h3>Long-Haired Velvet is Slow-Moving, While Light-Weight Woolens and Cashmeres are All Popular</h3>
<p>Woolen and cashmere shipping orders were not yet resolved yesterday. Generally, those eager to deliver goods are taking risks in transportation. Prices remain ostensibly stable but secretly strong. However, women's colored long-haired velvet has seen a recent slowdown in sales. Due to its excessive popularity, noble women are avoiding it. Also, the popularity of making leather coats is another reason for the slow sales of long-haired velvet.</p>
<p>Light-weight woolens and cashmeres are currently difficult to obtain due to the high cost and scarcity of raw materials, resulting in all of them being popular. The outlook is still bullish. (1) Flannel, regardless of Western suits or Chinese clothing, is in short supply and prices are firm. Internal and external warehouses and stores are lacking inventory. Goods imported from the East and West are also gradually becoming scarce. The local factory's supply is insufficient to meet demand, and the colors are scarce. Popular Chinese clothing flannel has more retail and speculative activity, and its price increase is naturally more intense than that of pullover Western suit flannel. (2) Water-repellent woolen fabric: Imported goods have long been sold out. Currently, most of the circulating transactions are textiles from Shanghai. However, due to recent restrictions, they are also scarce. Plain colors are selling briskly. Most of the items on the market are only dark blue in color. It is reported that grass green dye has been discontinued and cannot be produced. (3) Viyella: Recently, the amount of this product on the market, whether striped or plain, has decreased compared to the previous month. Due to limited production, most of the old stock has been snapped up by people inside and outside the industry. (4) Serge: White serge has attracted attention and is sought after, with prices rising and goods scarce. Grass green is second. Other thick and thin serge are also becoming scarce, and light-weight goods often exceed the price limit. (5) Tricotine: Black and white are both lacking. Black tricotine is still available for sale, but white tricotine is difficult to find. It is reported that white raw materials must be clean and snow-white, and the supply of毛條 is about to be cut off, so general factories will feel difficult to produce. (6) Flannel: Because it cannot be spun and woven from wool scraps and shredded velvet, its production is also small. Goods are scarce and prices are expensive. Yesterday, diagonal-patterned bottoms were priced at 300 yuan per yard, plate four bottoms were 250 to 260 yuan, and factory goods were 120 yuan to 160 yuan. (7) Palisi, Yusha woolen fabric, and Wanliding, etc., have limited old stock and most of the new products are lacking. Those with capital inside and outside the industry have successively absorbed a lot of them, resulting in a sharp rise in prices, which is the top among woolen and cashmere stores in the past ten days. (8) "Fatty" cotton is extremely scarce and prices are rising. There are prices but no goods for Fo Ye Lai. Dan Limeng are secretly firm. Dark blue is more active than other colors. The Guanghuo style of plate four woolen fabric is pretty. Wool goods are stable and flat. The colors of women's cheongsam woolen fabric are completely subject to temporary changes depending on the color.</p>
<h3>Gold Jewelry Listing Price Unchanged, Discount Rate Reduced by Two Fen Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the listed price of gold jewelry in the city's jewelry stores was still 3,050 yuan per tael, unchanged (the purchase price was reduced by about 300 yuan). The informal market price among the same industry, due to the approaching end of the year, was in demand but without supply, and the price was slightly lower at 1,770 to 1,780 yuan. The listed price of silver ornaments was still 16 yuan per tael, and the inter-industry price was around 17 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the discount rate of the Money Trade Association was 1.8 fen, reduced by another 0.2 fen.</p>
<h3>Joint Banknotes Approaching the Four Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the inter-industry price of military notes was 5.5535 yuan. The price for small money houses and banks was 5.56 yuan and 5.545 yuan. Joint Reserve Bank notes suddenly saw a sharp decline to within 4 yuan, with buying and selling prices at 3.88 yuan and 3.89 yuan.</p>
<h3>73 Member Money Houses</h3>
<p>The number of newly established joint-stock company money houses in the city has been increasing recently. According to the Money Trade Association's Money House (i.e., remittance house), there were a total of 50 companies listed in the first month of the lunar calendar this year. As of recently, it has increased to 73 companies. The full list is explored and recorded below: Da Lai, Yuan Sheng, Wu Feng, Ren Chang, Zheng Tai, An Kang, An Yu, Cun De, Tong Run, Jun Chang, Jun Tai, Cheng Yu, Yi Da, Xin Fu, Xin Yu, Chun Yuan, Zhi Xiang, Shun Kang, Hui Chang, Yi Chang, Yi Long, Fu Kang, Fu Yuan, Geng Yu, Zi Lan, Qing Da, Qing Cheng, Ding Kang, Zheng Xiang, Heng Jiu, Heng Tong, Bao Feng, Fu Li, Jin Yuan, Xin He, Yi He, Qi Chang, Yong Long, Xin Zhong, Shen De, Dun Yu, Jia Chang, Shi Chang, Tai Lai, Tong Kang, Zi Kang, Cun Cheng, Hui Da, Ju Kang, Tian Yi, Feng Yu, Yuan Heng, Run Yuan, Yuan Lai, An Tai, Zhen Tai, Yi Da, Fu Hua, Rui Xiang, Heng Yuan, Kai Tai, Qi Xin, Ding Feng, Yuan Chang, Ju Feng, Chun Yuan, Cheng Feng, Li Cheng, Hong Da, Tian Cheng, Xin Da, De Fu, Yuan Xiang.</p>
<h3>Small Volume of Chinese Stocks Traded During the Holiday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market was in the midst of the New Year holiday, and the same industry was winding down. However, a small number of stock companies accepted client entrustments to buy and sell, resulting in a hidden market. Amid the sparse trading, the bid and ask prices differed greatly. Some investors wanted to buy but couldn't find any sellers, while others wanted to sell but lacked buyers. There were no official market prices, and the trend was mostly weak. Those seeking cash sales were more active. The market prices of those with transactions are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Newly Arrived Broad Beans to Be Distributed Within Days</h3>
<p>The source of miscellaneous grains is still scarce, and retail sales are not sluggish, so the market trend remains firm and unchanged. Yesterday, 20 packages of Chongming New Sand Red opened at 350 yuan, and 15 packages of New Sand Yellow opened at 230 yuan. 4,000 packages of Jiading White Silkworm opened at 275 yuan. Three trucks of Fat Character Bean Cake opened at 84 yuan to 85 yuan, and five trucks of Yuan Long Bean Cake opened at 84 yuan to 85 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, according to reports, the Miscellaneous Grain Group recently received 500 tons (10,000 packages) of broad beans, which will be distributed within days. The allocation price per担 is 46.5 yuan in military notes.</p>
<h3>Increased Sugar Allocation, Amount Undetermined</h3>
<p>This month's sugar is intended to meet the needs of the Lunar New Year holiday, so sales are bound to increase. Retailers have requested an additional allocation of 10,000 packages, but no decision has been made yet. As for the per capita sugar rationing, it will not be implemented for the time being. It is found that there is still a lot of sugar in storage, so even if there is no continued arrival, there will be no shortage.</p>
<h3>Kelp is Popular, Shredded Kelp is Sluggish</h3>
<p>Kelp is scarce due to the lack of arrivals and sparse inventory, so even though it is a common commodity, the price increase is not dull. At the end of last month, it was only 500 yuan, but now it has risen to 720 yuan. Yesterday's market was even higher at 480 yuan. Shredded kelp is originally the same product, but because there is little demand, it has been sluggish for a long time, selling at only one-tenth of the price, and still few are willing to take it.</p>
<h3>Basket-Packed Longan Restored</h3>
<p>Basket-packed miscellaneous longan continued to be offered on the market yesterday. Because the goods were relatively common and had broken shells, the traders' buying price was not high. A batch was immediately offered, and the price of those with uneven particles had broken through the 900 yuan mark. It is heard that another batch is packed and on the way, so the trend is soft and flat.</p>
<h3>Almonds and Straw Mushrooms Have Weak Arrivals and Sales</h3>
<p>The almond market is mediocre. Currently, white jade almonds are priced at 2,700 to 2,800 yuan, North Mountain almonds are priced at 1,400 to 1,500 yuan, Dragon King almonds are priced at 2,000 yuan, and Kuang almonds are priced at 2,000 yuan. Straw mushrooms are in short supply and sales are weak. The market price is still stable. Zisheng is priced at 15,000 yuan, and Li Baqi is priced at 9,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>White Lead Wire is Short and Seeing Price Increases</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for coarse and fine white lead wire saw a slight increase in inquiries from merchants, and demand from manufacturers and scattered users also showed signs of stirring. Therefore, the long-silent white lead market began to unfold yesterday. However, the inventory of this product in Shanghai is short, and it is difficult to find a full range of coarse and fine colors. It is also difficult to source. At the same time, holders of goods, due to the shortage of spot goods, the standard pace saw an upward trend. Currently, the market price is around 1,000 yuan per担, and holders are reluctant to easily sell their inventory, so buyers are running around and it is still difficult to recruit. The biggest reason is that the inventory of hardware products in Shanghai is very short.</p>
<h3>Little Change in Cigarettes</h3>
<p>The cigarette market is stable as usual. There has been very little speculative news recently, and with the approach of the end of the year, actual sales are light, so off-site trading has been very quiet. As for the Guild market that has been closed until now, it may resume business soon. In the future, when entering the market for transactions, it is necessary to abide by the rules. As long as the factory continues to supply goods without interruption, hoarders will inevitably disappear on their own, and the selling price can be stabilized. Therefore, observing the future market, it is unlikely to continue to rise. Yesterday's market prices were: Great British brand, 9,350 yuan; Old Knife brand, 8,300 yuan; Pinhai brand, 7,500 yuan; Fairy brand, 7,250 yuan; Five Hua brand, 6,000 yuan; Japanese cigarette Golden Spear brand, 2,800 yuan; Jin Dalou, 3,200 yuan; Red Rose, 2,600 yuan; Quanlu brand, 2,900 yuan; Guide brand, 2,400 yuan; National cigarette Pyramid, 6,400 yuan; Beautiful brand, 5,600 yuan; Golden Mouse brand, 3,790 yuan; Platinum Dragon, 3,850 yuan, with no changes compared to the weekend.</p>
<h3>Prices of Daily Necessities Remain Stable</h3>
<p>The market for daily necessities is quite quiet, and prices remain stable. Phoenix matches sell for 3,000 yuan, Beautiful 3,200 yuan, Golden Ding 2,800 yuan, miscellaneous brands 2,350 yuan, Gu Ben soap 515 yuan, Bai Xiangmao 480 yuan, Huang Xiangmao 415 yuan, Bai Lishi 洋燭 420 yuan, 儈帽 360 yuan, miscellaneous brands 250 yuan.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Qualifications</h3>
<p>— Jia Sheng</p>
<p>At a banquet, I encountered a few young men with slicked-back hair, shiny faces, and impeccably tailored suits. After a few rounds of drinks, one of the suit-clad young men, filled with self-importance, began to inquire about the qualifications of those around him.</p>
<p>"My friend, are you from Columbia?"</p>
<p>"Yes! Yes!"</p>
<p>"My friend, are you from Harvard?"</p>
<p>"No, I'm from Yale."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>The fathers and elder brothers of these suit-clad young men had served as officials, warlords, compradors, or landlords. From a young age, they had studied at domestic mission schools. Their current qualifications included doctorates, master's degrees, and bachelor's degrees.</p>
<p>What was the true academic level of these doctoral, master's, and bachelor's degree holders? How much money did they spend studying abroad? After returning to China, what contributions had they made to the country and society? We don't have time to research these questions.</p>
<p>What we are researching is, if the fathers and elder brothers of these young men were not officials, warlords, compradors, or landlords, but were commoners or the poor, could these young men have obtained doctorates, master's degrees, and bachelor's degrees? I think, in this era of commodification, these young men would probably have graduated from elementary school or middle school at most, and would have long been forced by economic circumstances to make a living in society and earn money to support their families! Fortunately, their fathers and elder brothers had money. That is why they were able to obtain qualifications such as doctorates. Therefore, I suddenly realized:</p>
<p>"The *zi* in *zige* (qualification) contains the meaning of *ziben* (capital). Only by investing capital can one obtain qualifications. Invest a share of capital, and obtain a share of qualification. Without capital, forget about obtaining qualifications."</p>
<p>Don't the enrollment brochures for domestic elementary and middle schools also clearly state in black and white: Enrollment is only granted after tuition fees are paid? The children of ordinary people don't even have the capital to attend elementary school, so what are we talking about doctorates, master's degrees, and bachelor's degrees?</p>
<p>Doctorates, master's degrees, bachelor's degrees, and other qualifications have already been wholesale purchased or reserved by the sons of wealthy families with capital. At the same time, the hiring standards of various institutions and companies in society are based on the level of qualifications. Therefore, the sons of wealthy families are destined to be doctors, masters, and bachelors from the womb. And at the same time, they are destined to be senior staff or directors, managers. Qualifications, qualifications, the capital of the fathers and elder brothers has already determined the qualifications and fate of the children.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people will say that there are also doctors, masters, and bachelors in society who come from humble backgrounds; as long as they are willing to work hard, it is not difficult to obtain scholarships or government-funded studies abroad.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are such cases, but the proportion of opportunities is too small. Let those who have already obtained them or those who are trying to obtain them report on the difficulties of obtaining them.</p>
<h3>The Role of Money</h3>
<p>— E Sheng</p>
<p>Mankind has three functions regarding the role of money: making money, saving money, and using money. These three functions are forcibly separated for the sake of reasoning. In reality, they are very closely linked and are the keys to the three major gates in our economic society.</p>
<p>Regarding making money: If a person is solely focused on pursuing money and wealth, regardless of integrity and shame, and without distinguishing between right and wrong, this type of person is considered the most hateful and pitiful person in the world. We might as well call them "money mad." However, "ill-gotten gains" will still be "ill-spent." Even if they themselves are not harmed, they will sooner or later cause trouble for their descendants.</p>
<p>Regarding saving money: Saving money is recognized as a virtue because it indirectly allows social consumption to enter a normal state. At the same time, it can also collect the savings of many people and use them to increase the activity of the entire economic society. It can directly benefit individuals, so-called preparing for a rainy day, so that in case of emergency, one does not have to beg others.</p>
<p>Regarding using money: The prerequisite for using money is to understand the meaning of money itself, so that one can avoid "waste" and focus on "consumption." In other words, although money is a medium for exchanging goods, the method of exchanging for goods and the means of using goods should be considered in terms of satisfying one's own desires without harming society.</p>
<p>Among the above three functions, as long as one of them causes a ripple in the economic society, human society will be shocked and even shaken. For example, the stealing and fraud of thieves and thugs are abnormal means of making money; the miser's greed for money and unwillingness to engage in public welfare are abnormal means of saving money; the prodigal son's spending money like dirt is an abnormal means of using money.</p>
<h3>Spitoon</h3>
<p>— Ji Xiao Shang</p>
<p>Once, my maternal uncle and I were waiting for a train at the station. Bored, we chatted and laughed aimlessly to pass the time.</p>
<p>My maternal uncle suddenly asked me, "What is a spitoon?"</p>
<p>I said, "It is a container for people to spit phlegm into, called a spitoon."</p>
<p>My maternal uncle then asked, "Suppose a spitoon, from the time it is manufactured in the factory until it is destroyed, has never held a mouthful of phlegm, is it still considered a spitoon?"</p>
<p>Without thinking, I replied, "It is ultimately a spitoon."</p>
<p>My maternal uncle smiled and said, "It is really not a spitoon!"</p>
<p>I thought about it carefully and realized that my maternal uncle was right. It really cannot be considered a spitoon. I am ultimately too stupid.</p>
<p>The train arrived, and we parted ways, unable to continue the conversation. However, whenever I think of that conversation, I feel a jolt of alarm in my heart.</p>
<p>Therefore, I often ask myself inwardly, "Although I have the form of a 'person,' do I possess the conditions to be a 'person'? Am I a 'person,' a dignified and upright 'person'?"</p>
<h3>A Social Ailment: Playing Mahjong</h3>
<p>— Da Guan</p>
<p>The most valuable aspect of good governance in ancient times was "changing customs and habits." Wen Weng's governance of Shu in the Han Dynasty was able to transform customs and people's hearts for the better, so he was called a meritorious official, because the effect of "changing customs and habits" is to cure social ills and make society sound. But how easy is it to do?</p>
<p>The deepest and most widespread social ailment today is playing mahjong. Regardless of wealth, gender, or social class, most people consider playing a few rounds of mahjong as their daily work. If you try walking through the alleys at night, you can't help but hear the clatter of tiles. It has become so common that no one finds it strange, which shows that there are countless people addicted to it. Last year, I wanted to find a legitimate form of entertainment, so I wanted to buy a set of Go stones to play. I went to the City God Temple market and searched several shops, but I couldn't find a set of Go stones. However, there were at least a hundred or so shops selling mahjong tiles, and the prices were very expensive. This shows how much society needs this kind of thing.</p>
<p>People in society should be diligent in their careers. Let's not even mention the fact that mahjong is actively harmful to one's career. Speaking of the advantages and disadvantages of mahjong itself, those who love to play mahjong think it is a kind of entertainment that can relieve boredom and dispel worries. If it is done occasionally, it is harmless, but if you constantly engage in this activity, over time, regardless of winning or losing, the consumption of things like cigarettes, snacks, and simple meals in this gambling game... isn't it paid for by the people in the game? In that case, the money will only go out and not come in, and the people involved should understand that very well.</p>
<p>Especially when the luck isn't good, it is a really bad time, causing endless complaints. A certain poet wrote a self-repentant poem about playing mahjong, with the line: "Seeking pleasure invites strange numerical misfortunes, passing time turns into worrying about missed opportunities." If you carefully savor these two lines, you will find that so-called "entertainment" is simply asking for trouble, and so-called "passing time" and "relieving worries" actually turn into烦恼. What's the point? Is there really no other fun to be found besides this damn thing? These people who play mahjong must have learned many lessons from their experiences, and they are not all muddleheaded. The fact that they are addicted to it and don't regret it is really because the root of the social illness is too deep, and they are so tightly bound by the environment that it is difficult to break free.</p>
<p>This is a social illness, and the entire society must be cured. The methods of treatment are: (1) Use collective power to prohibit it, and if there are repeat offenders, do not hesitate to punish them by law. (2) Use educational methods to influence them and make them thoroughly aware, and special attention should be paid to social education. At the same time, promote legitimate entertainment to bring those with leisure time back on track. If this widespread social ailment is not eradicated, we will see the disease spread wider and deeper, and everyone will be dissolute in gambling, and not diligent in their careers. Inevitably, the society's economy will gradually decline, and morality will also gradually decline. Isn't this a hidden worry for the future of the nation?</p>
<h3>Self-Confidence</h3>
<p>— Hai Lin</p>
<p>The worst thing in the world is not trusting yourself; losing self-confidence is losing your most precious asset.</p>
<p>The morality of success is built on self-confidence; failures often happen because people don't trust their own strength. They turn back as soon as they encounter a wall, not knowing that developing self-confidence is something that involves setbacks.</p>
<p>Some people only hope for self-confidence, but don't build it. Building self-confidence is a task that cannot be stopped for a moment. You should carefully consider each thing you do, and then immediately strengthen your self-confidence and move forward bravely. If you abandon self-confidence, your work will immediately fail, without a doubt.</p>
<p>To build self-confidence, we must make sure that today's work is a step further than yesterday's, and at the same time, we can see our mistakes and correct them every day. In that case, we will be progressing every day, cultivating a lively and energetic life.</p>
<p>One step ahead of building self-confidence is thought. We must build new ideas and plans every day to make our self-confidence stronger and more solid.</p>
<p>These cornerstones on the road to success are daily work. At the same time, please remember that people without self-confidence are the worst people.</p>
<h3>After Seeing "Begonia" — The Crystallization of Six Artists</h3>
<p>— Zhu Feng</p>
<p>After seeing "Begonia" and walking out of the Carlton, a feeling welled up in my heart. I felt that what I saw tonight was not a play, but a magnificent, elegant, and profound story painting. And this was not painted with colors; the paint used was brainpower and effort, provided by six artists: the original author Qin Shouou, the directors Fei Mu, Zuo Lin, Gu Zhongyi, and the actors Shi Hui and Shen Min.</p>
<p>For the convenience of the performance and the need to consider time and location limitations, etc., the script certainly cannot completely follow the novel. Every novel adapted into a script will have some changes. For example, in the novel, Begonia's death is a suicide by jumping off a building, but on stage, it is portrayed as dying of exhaustion and illness in the backstage of a Beijing opera theater. This is purely because suicide by jumping off a building is too monotonous and not easy to perform well, so it was changed. At the same time, dying backstage can also be more lively. But on the whole, the script is indeed very faithful to the original work.</p>
<p>The three directors, Fei Mu, Zuo Lin, and Gu Zhongyi, are all seasoned veterans of the spoken drama world, and they handled the entire play brilliantly, with only one or two transitions being a bit stiff. The two actors, Shi Hui and Shen Min, can truly be said to be flawless. Their acting skills have simply reached a state of perfection.</p>
<p>If I had to nitpick, it would only be Begonia's makeup in the fifth act. The full head of white hair and the wrinkles on the face seemed too old. At the same time, Zhao Yukun and Luo Xiangqi's makeup seemed too young. It would be better to change the white hair that Begonia wears to gray-white, which seems more reasonable.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat in Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>One, Two, Later Garden Flower</p>
<p>After thinking this way, Wei Cheng didn't even dare to go home. In the dim light of dawn, pedestrians gradually appeared on the road. He thought about how last year today, he had rescued Sister Cuizhen from Fei Changhe's hands: Guofang was alone, taking a car from Shuangqiao to Shide Hall; at that time, although I had just suffered a great loss, I was still happy in my heart. Unexpectedly, only a year had passed, and it had changed to this point. While running, he unknowingly ran to the northern countryside of Shide Hall, to his uncle Li Youxie's rice mill, which appeared before him. He walked into the mill to find his uncle. Li Youxie was planning to enshrine the God of Wealth today and then sit high at the account table. When he saw Wei Cheng, he was overjoyed and said, "I was just about to send someone to pick you up, and you came. What's wrong? Your sleeve is bleeding?" Wei Cheng pulled Li Youxie into a room inside and said that he had gotten drunk last night and went to kill someone with Huang Long, but he didn't succeed in killing the person, and instead got injured himself. Li Youxie was surprised that Wei Cheng wasn't the kind of person who would kill, and questioned him further. Wei Cheng said, "I want to borrow your place to hide. If you still think of me as a relative, please don't even tell my aunt." Li Youxie was full of suspicion, not understanding what he was doing, and pressed him for an explanation. He just kept repeating those few sentences. Fortunately, the rice mill should stop work during the New Year, and will not resume until after the Lantern Festival. Li Youxie locked Wei Cheng in a deep room, and even moved the God of Wealth feast today to the residence on the east side.</p>
<p>Around noon, Second Madam Ye sent A Xing to ask if the young master had come. Li Youxie then asked A Xing what was going on. He didn't dare to tell A Xing that Wei Cheng was hiding here, and only comforted A Xing with a few words, saying, "Tell the Second Madam to rest assured. It must be that the two brothers lost money gambling first and fell asleep, feeling unwilling, and happily said that the brothers went to win back the money. It's nothing." After A Xing left, Li Youxie came to tell Wei Cheng, and saw Wei Cheng pulling cotton from the quilt and applying it to his arm. He tried to persuade Wei Cheng to go back, but Wei Cheng refused, and stayed for four or five days. Li Youxie was afraid that Second Madam Ye was worried, so he personally went to Shide Hall, and subtly revealed some news to Second Madam Ye in his tone, saying, "Wei Cheng is fine, you don't have to worry as his aunt. In a few days, he will naturally come back. If he doesn't come back, ask me, his uncle." (256)</p>
