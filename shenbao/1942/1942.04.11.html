<p>尼赫魯發宣言決爲自由奮鬥</p>
<p>新德里九日路透社電　國民大會領袖尼赫魯頃發表談話稱、印人對於美國夙表仰慕友好之熱忱、美國刻下正負起偉大之任務、木人希望美國可以完成其大業、惟本人所不能已於言者、端爲美國報紙之論列、不無令人驚異、余意此必爲美報對於印度情形缺乏認識所致、美國報紙最近曾迭作敎誨勸吿之詞、或謂與印有利、何者與印無益、甚至謂美方之勤吿倘若我輩不能接受、則情形必致如何如何、其中不無威脅之意、要知友人之</p>
<p>對英國新方案印各黨派態度</p>
<p>新德里九日哈瓦斯社電　英國訪印特使克里浦斯爵士、本日分別致函印度各大政治團體、邀請各黨各派參加未來的印度國民政府、並請其答覆此項合作辦法是否可行、茲將各派反嚮誌後（一）國民大會態度如何、此際尙不可知、該會領袖阿柴特尼赫魯二人、曾於本日午後與克里浦斯爵士進行長時間談話、惟雙方均拒不發表任何聲明、此在國民大會研究委員會、則於今夜開會討論應付方針、並決定於明晨八時半賡續開會、（二）回敎同盟執行委員會亦定於明日開會、討論此事、（三）印度敎大乘會對於克里浦斯特使之建議、聞已提出覆文、該會主席薩伐加爾、曾於本日午後訪唔孟買總督、據聞係吿以該會所抱態度、質言之、大乘會對於英國提案中准許印度各省自由決定是否參加聯邦一項辦法、雖仍保持絕對反對態度、但極願參加新國民政府、據一般人所知、該會將在新政府內佔有二席、據克里浦斯爵士談稱、大乘會主席薩伐加爾、因本日不能前來新德里、故已將覆文送達孟買總督云、</p>
<p>新德里九日路透社電克利浦斯與印度政治領袖之談判、已歷時十六日、就一般人士之感覺爲回敎聯盟要人所持之審愼態度、雖可表示今後之調整當需相當時日、但衆認克氏與國民大會成立諒解之希望甚大、衆信今日國民大會常務委員會以竟日之時問開會、舉行最詳細之研討、並與克利浦斯及美總統私人代表約翰生詳商，以期爲求得解決時獲取最大之助力、回敎聯盟常務委員會約將於明日向克利浦斯提出時英國宣言案及對於國防新原則之答覆、委會今日會商討上兩次建議達七小時以上、據悉委會將對建議關於印度之未來部分表示不滿、衆信委會將擁護眞納之要求、主張英方以明白之文字、承認「巴基斯坦」制度、委會曾追述及克利浦斯所稱建議或全部接受或全部拒絕一點、鑒於過去回敎聯盟會對克氏之建議表示異議、今後關於建議中當前之措置一部分、有無加以商討之餘地、彼等甚願淸楚獲悉、委會重述彼等準備參加政府、但以彼等在政府之實權上、能獲眞正之一部權限、衆料眞納將於明日、再晤克利浦斯討論委會所提出之各點云、</p>
<p>談判重大障礙尚待加以克服</p>
<p>倫敦十日路透社電　克利浦斯已度過其最大難關之一、但若謂解決業已在望、尙失之過早、渠決定仍留新德里及展期發表其預約之聲明、觀察家皆見印度空氣已有改進、原因第一、在克利浦斯自身渠行將在印度國民大會及英國政府之鴻溝間架一橋樑、第二、現實主義在印度政治中之新貫輸、印度國家主義者各主耍領袖顯在研究建設性之解決方案、第三、克氏已使全世界認識印度問題之特質、與英國政策之建設性、全世界輿論尤其是美國之一般情緒、可贊同英國所擬之實際行動建議、此點必可有助於談判之成功、但因目下尙有重大障碍須待克服、是以數週以內、各方尙應持謹愼之樂觀態度云、</p>

<p>羅馬尼亞京城九日哈瓦斯社日本駐德大使大鳥將軍、方有東南歐洲之行、甫於昨日抵此、據其向報界談稱、本人此次遊歷東南歐洲，並無政治作用、僅欲身歷其境、一觀軸心公約簽字各國現况、最近數年來全世界政治上與理想上已發生種種重大變更、新民族嶄露頭角、建立新的民族團體者不一而足、羅馬尼亞人民即已步入民族生活的新時期、貴國實力充足、使余發生極深刻之印象、日本與其各與國現正爲建立世界新秩序而戰、以求貫澈世界各民族均能獲得和平與實際福利項目的、余深信此次戰爭、吾人必獲勝利、三角公約使吾人團結一致、超越單純的軍事同盟以上、盎格魯撤克遜人每以日本及其與國經濟困難爲宣傳資料、此乃虛張聲勢、日木已使盎格魯撒克遜族各國、不復能立足遠東、此乃鐵的事實、日本此種舉足輕重之力量、對於世界新秩序之建立、自必大有裨益、按大島定於明日前往保加利亞京城、然後轉赴雅典一行、</p>

<h3>傳德利誘土國　參加軸心</h3>
<p>華盛頓九日電　柏林傳來之消息、引起美國務卿威爾斯今日招待記時之注意、傳土耳其駐柏林使節將携德計創一項返安哥拉、內準備予土耳其以若干權益、而以土耳其加入軸心爲交換條件、據稱敘利亞將爲德國給予「友好」土國之主要領土、記者以此說有無證實或其他消息詢問威氏、答日本人、以爲此說或屬確實、德國政府作此類諾言、從無時對其本身不利之時、對方往往發現德國自身擬收得此利益、</p>
<p>羅馬九日哈瓦斯社電　卡利諾報載有土耳共京城消息、據稱駐紮敘利亞之紐西蘭軍隊、近日忽在土國邊界集中、</p>
<h3>土耳其的護城河</h3>
<p>在不肯的一方面說，那是因爲上次歐戰後土人失去了很多小邦，吃了不小的虧，也許要在這次，利用德人，收回疆土。這一條理由，不大結實，因爲土人的意見，是民治方面對土國無領土的野心，而德國則不然。如此說來，萬一德穗人要假道的話，上人只有荷戈了。但土國撮爾之邦，所有兵力全算在內，僅有六十萬名，德國動起手來，簡直是泰山壓卵一般，土人敢抵抗嗎？關於這一點，土人的唯一見解是「見看風頭」，在土人的眼光中，德人如有戰勝全球的把握。土人常然助德。不然的話，土人倒是肯犧牲一下，暫時充任一道護城河。敗了，反正可以退到小亞西亞一帶，後面正有英蘇的大軍雲集在伊朗伊拉克等區，將來論功行賞，還怕不能重建一個嶄新的土耳其？</p>
<p>以上說明了德人東進的可能與不可能，再要跳到北進的陣錢去看看。北進當是跟蘇聯拚個你死我活。</p>
<p>提起蘇聯這隻大熊，端的叫人頭痛；人，德人也。</p>
<p>當初希特勒決定與蘇聯交手的時候，據說德國大將和希氏幕後二前多專家，並無一人贊成。爲了木文前而說過，不得不戰的三點理由，所以竟爾戰了。照希氏的神機軍師漢倍尼，這天時專家說，如在入凍之前能將莫斯科打下，不妨一試。這一點希氏里寗格勒，而一面又進攻到了距俄京七十里的所在，可是正在這可望而不可及的當口，天降大雪，幫了蘇聯的大忙。道一齣戲，台下觀衆都很熟悉，不必多贅。</p>
<p>如今單把德人所蘇聯爲新攻勢目標的一塲戲，眞出來研究一下。</p>
<p>蘇人的耐戰，連穗人也佩服，可見在戰略和勇武一方面，也不用多說了。天時方面，只有四五六七八九，六個月中，穗蘇雙方，可以享受平等待遇。其餘上凍之後，却只有蘇聯的世界。地利方面，蘇聯一面吃苦，一面也討便宜；然而却是利在蘇聯。物力方而，有了英美無窮盡的接濟，更可一篤定」。人力呢？據說二千五百萬兵，確實可以微調應用，此外，農民男婦，武裝起來，也很兇猛。這樣看，實力方面，雖說不比德國髙出多少，最低也可說對敵得過。</p>
<p>再看穗國，德國最髙兵力恐有一千五百萬名，開戰以來，死傷在二三百萬之譜，此外還有很大一部分，分散在波，捷·意·法·挪·荷·菲·等處；所以「新攻勢」可用之兵，就得大大的打一個折扣。空軍方面當然很兇，然在空襲倫教的時期，已經喪去萬名左右，其後襲蘇，和克里底島，雖無統計，想必折損的也不在少數。飛機及其他軍器產品，當然也很可觀，但原料方面很有問題。要不是速戰速決，勝利的希望恐怕難說。汽油一項，更是德人的一個嚴重問題。世上汽油，美佔百之七十，蘇佔百之十，現在就是問穗人儲備了多少，在佔領區獲到了多少。要是不多的話，納粹前途，恐怕就要糟在這一點上。</p>
<p>兩國形勢如此，我們究竟怎樣來下斷語呢？這話別說我們不好下斷語，恐怕這位納粹領袖對這問題，也無從斷定季從春」季攻勢一變而爲「夏」。攻勢正可證實這一點。</p>
<p>現在從報上曾訊來看，蘇聯好像在預備總反攻，英國方面，把印度問題安定之後，恐怕必要乘隙而來了。希特勒也許是要看看風頭再說？</p>
<p>觀以上各點，這歐洲的三四本連台戲，也有一個模糊的輪廓了。可是觀衆得注意一點，希特勒這人常常喜歡來一套驚人心目的玩意兒。好好的春季攻勢，爲何到了三月尾了，還是陰陽怪氣的按兵不動？（指新攻勢之調兵造將而言）。土國總統爲何這幾天連連表示心跡？爲何前些時在土京有謀刺德使巴本一事發生？英機又爲何誤炸土境密拉斯城？這些蛛絲馬跡之中，要尋出一條綫案來，還要請台下觀衆，放下千里鏡來，往自己眼面前看看。這裏而是否有一個「鉗形陣，或「箍桶陣」在着？譬如說要是一旦印度有事，這土耳其的護城河是否阻隔得住穗軍大兵的東指？</p>
<p>這一齣戲，熱閙得很，唱與不唱，是要看台上的角兒們究竟是否準備這樣唱。同時，還要看美國受了英人的重託，現在正在積極進行組班；班子組織成功，是否恰當其時上台表演；及表演的成績如何，却是德人決定新攻勞的一個最大因素。（完）</p>

<p>春夏之交，瘋狗最易發見，傅染於人，名恐水症，非獨症狀可怖，亦且苦痛萬分，大概中毒之瘋犬，其初起時動作遲鈍，精神失常，若鬱鬱不樂，食慾减退，此種狀態有經過數小時，或多至一二日，忽而發狂，吠聲突變，喉嘶聲啞，其聲可怖，出外狂奔，逢人逢物，便起狂齩，如關在籠中，則籠木爲所咬折，當之者無不受其毒，故見犬疾馳而來，兩眼直視，炯炯有光，頭頸僵直，口流涎沫，或垂頭洩尾，彳亍而行，或如醉漢行路，東倒西歪，有如浪形，及至行步瞞跚，勢成癱瘓，因其喉間痙孿，咳嗆聲惡，頻搔其喉，兩顎僵硬，齒牙均裂，唾液更多，如滲人人之皮膚腸胃中，立即中毒，故不但爲瘋狗所咬，毒液人皮膚，即瘋狗所咬過器物樹木，亦不宜使用，中瘋狗毒者，經過潛伏期少則一二星期，多則兩三月，及至症狀已顯，醫治爲難。</p>
<p>瘋狗症之治療</p>
<p>（甲）西法治療瘋狗症，首經發明者爲法國科學家柏斯德，係將鬼子移種中瘋狗毒的獸類脊髓，製成乳劑，種於兎子身上，再用兎子的脊髓移種於患瘋狗病者，但巴斯德之藥不易保存，且轉動甚費事，新近有賽姆潑耳法，亦用種有瘋狗液之色子脊髓，但其製法交完密，惟兩者俱係西藥，在現在之交　下，均有不能購致之慮，其次只有用中國之醫法</p>
<p>（乙）中法　中國療法，係根據浙江蕭山臨浦鎭孔　湘所印行者，以其已見成效，方有兩種，（一）外治（二）內治。</p>
<p>外治之方，爲當門子　錢（即麝香之佳者），西牛黃二分，梅花水片一錢，腰雄黃五分，製廿石五分，並附有說明云</p>
<p>藥之合製</p>
<p>（一）選藥　此方主藥爲「當門子」，但普通藥店所售當門子，有眞假良劣，品質不齊，倘用其假者劣者，則全藥失効，切宜愼之，當門子眞者，顆粒不勻凈，大小不，最大者有如桂圓核，比深褐色較黑，而發潤澤油光，氣味芳烈，如色澤枯暗，當係僞品，又有一種名散香者，顆粒大小如菉豆，而勻凈相等，皆不可用，方內西牛黃，亦係要藥，此藥形如破桂圓殼，色亦類似，中分層數，厚約二三分，而質甚輕，色甚顯者爲眞，如塊不分層，而色澤暗者爲僞，購藥可至各都會中馳名大藥店，但仍須審視各藥是否與上述相符。（二）合藥用細磁鈢，先將當門子等研碎，再加入冰片，用輕手研末，（用重手則當門子等與冰片結成一塊）或將冰片另行研末後，加入亦可，全藥研得愈細，則藥力愈速，大約須繼續研五六小時而成，必須一日之內研成，以免芳氣發散過甚，合成後，用雙層細絹篩篩出，（如磁缽及篩等係向藥店借用須注意其淸潔）（三）儲藏　儲藥必須用中國玻璃廠所出之一分瓶（不宜用過大之瓶），全藥重量三錢二分，約可分儲三十五瓶，每瓶須將藥粉裝得滿實，瓶塞外再用黃蠟封口，而儲之於不漏氣之金屬罐內，携帶時亦應以瓶儲之，勿用紙包，因此藥芳氣易散，氣盡則効力失，故保藏宜密，購藥亦以足一年之用爲度，以免藥陳效减也。</p>
<p>藥之用法</p>
<p>（甲）瘋狗咬將藥粉半粒米許，用銀針搽入大眼角男左女右，毒重者兩目俱搽，輕者一目，搽後閉目靜坐，或臥半小時，鄕下人之無時計者，可燃棒香一枝爲準，（目不閉則藥力不能內行，故以多閉爲妙）每日搽三次，最少須搽完半瓶如尙有毒，則再搽，其騐毒方法，見瘋狗咬禁忌單（因狗毒在咬處無　著狀態故須另法騐之）。（乙）蛇咬　用法與（甲）項同，但狗咬之毒，往往在數十日後發作，而蛇毒則立時發動，有數小時後口角流誕，氣喘暈眩昏厥者，則毒已劇，除眼搽外，應同時內服此藥一瓶四分之一，危急者可用半瓶，開水送下，不愈再服，服後有大使下血槐，或口吐血塊，大抵血塊從便出後，昏者即醒，如醒後尙感身體不適，可每日用藥如茶豆大許服之，至爽暢爲止搽眼藥以患處腫消盡爲止，蛇咬亦須忌口，共方法輿狗咬者同，毒輕者腫消爲止，重者全愈後須多忌數日，（輕者指無昏厥等狀即略有眼花等情尙不爲重）又蛇咬重者　，如當時不及用藥，則可以早烟管油用開水冲服，毒重者則覺其味甘而不辣，可再服之，至覺味辣而止，然後再用他藥　，亦救急之良方也。（丙）瘡毒　用法甚簡，即以藥敷於瘡口　，即能拔毒生新，共曾經治愈者，有反唇疔蛇眼疔發背蟲咬潰爛及其他瘡毒潰爛等，但重要瘡毒，據中醫有所謂陰症瘡與陽症瘡之別，（所謂陰症瘡者其形態大扺不紅腫不痛癢）此藥宜於陽症瘡，而不宜於陰症　，故如遇重要瘡症難辨陰陽者，務須請醫生鑒別之，切勿擅用。（丁）注意事項此藥醫治各症除（丙）項外將及百年，其方法及手續，係實地研究所得，皆關重要，務請用者切弗忽視，茲舉一例以明之，某年浙江義鳥縣瘋狗爲患，該地善士特向本人素藥及方以去，但以索去之藥治之者，則皆愈，而以照方自配之藥治之者皆毒發而死，研詢結果，則知所購之當門子」乃係散香（見第一項說明）是故若有善士樂施此藥者，須注意上述（一）（二）（三）（四）四項手續，庶不至貽誤患者生命也，又此藥孕婦忌服，但果係眞瘋狗或毒蛇所咬，則亦在所不忌。</p>
<p>禁忌</p>
<p>被狗咬者除搽眼藥之外，於衣食住尤有禁忌，病者宜小心遵守，否則雖有良藥無效也，（一）忌房事，犯者不治，（二）忌與人爭鬧及動氣，（三）忌聞金樂聲（如鑼鐘之類），或其他能震盪心臟之聲浪，或偶聞之，不可自恐，小兒更須避免驚嚇，（四）忌過於勞動，但適宜之運動或工作，在所不忌，（五）忌冷水洗面或洗身，（六）忌睡用新夏布帳或行蔴田中，及穿被咬時之衣服，（七）忌飯鍋上蒸病人所忌食物，連鮮菜亦不宜，他無論矣，最好將病人所吃之物，用另鍋煮造，（八）忌嗅有刺激性之肉類，菜類，如腥膻辛辣等，及其他劇烈氣味（如牛肉羊肉菜油酒糟等氣切不宜聞），（九）忌吃一切食物之不在下列表內者，如吃發食，毒必立發，宜吃食品，秈米，晚米，鹽，監白菜，鹽白菜乾，蘿卜，蘿卜乾，鮲鮳，（如雜有蝦皮或小黃魚者即不宜吃）鹽鴨蛋，蓮子，杏仁，莩薺，藕，雅梨，蘋果，（十）凡上述各倏禁忌，務須自　藥日起，小心遵守至一百二十日止，否則往往不治，慎之愼之。驗毒及藥方</p>
<p>騐毒之法，以生黃豆嚼之，有生腥氣者則毒輕，如吃熟豆者則毒重，起初隔日或隔三日試之，以後隔七日試之，至一百二十日，可以不必再試矣，毒重者，除掭眼藥之外，同時可服後方，或無眼藥，單服後方亦可，但以掭眼藥爲最妥，如嚼豆有腥氣可不再服，但切勿以嚼豆有腥氣，即以爲毒輕，而將上述各條禁忌，不再遵守，則貽患無窮矣。「眞紋黨三錢，桔梗三錢，前胡三錢，炒枳壳二錢，羌活三錢，生姜三錢，紅柴胡三錢，撫芎二錢，獨活三錢，茯苓三錢，生甘草三錢，生地楡一兩，紫竹根一大把先煎代湯（紫竹即製舊式雨傘柄之竹也）」</p>

<h3>節食主義</h3>
<p>— 衡</p>
<p>吃飯難！吃飯難！現在成爲大衆之重大問題。欲解決此問題，非從事實學理兩方面着想不可。人類食物，不問山珍海味，以至米荳菜疏，其主要成分，總不外澱粉質，蛋白質·及脂肪質三種。此等食物，一經人口，必須經過三道消化。</p>
<p>第一道消化，即口腔內消化。口腔內消化，分物理學消化與化學的消化。前者爲物理學作用，即齒牙咀嚼之工作，多嚼則食物細爛，容易消化，少嚼則物質粗笨，消化較難，後者爲化學作用，即由耳下腺·舌下腺·及顎下腺·分泌出一種液質，名曰唾液，能使　粉質逐漸分解。故食物過多，有唾液不足之感，而所食之物，不能完全消化，是爲唾液分泌不全。然食物不能因唾液分泌不全而長留口中也，必下嚥而入於皆。則起</p>
<p>第二道消化，即胃內消化。胃內消化亦分物理學的消化與化學的消化，胃之內膜，非常粗皺，經筋肉之伸縮作用，能將食物反覆攪拌與磨擦，使口腔內咀嚼不全之食物，作進步之物理學的消化。故若胃壁薄弱，或其運動不全，則食物之消化不良，然胃之內膜猶有腺，能分泌一種發起化學作用之液體，名曰胃液，以分解食物中之蛋白質。若胃液分泌不全，或食物過量，則根本不能完全消化，此項在胃內之容物，逐漸輸送入腸，則起第三道消化，即腸內消化，腸內消化，無異於口與胃之消化，亦分物理學的與化學的二種。葢腸之內膜，亦甚粗皺，所以備食物之米經磨細，而憑腸壁筋肉之仲縮作用，以使輸入腸內之食物，盡量磨成細末者，爲物理學作用。若腸壁之蠕動不健全，食物之消化自屬不良惟有賴於最後之化學的以作用，即腸內膜不但自身分泌固有液體，且於食物由胃入腸之際，在十二指腸部，並受脺之脺液，肝之膽汁，總稱之日腸液者，主在消化脂肪，並可消化口中消化不全之澱粉質及胃中消化不全之蛋白質者也。故腸之不健及脺與肝臟機能之不良者，結果陷於消化不良。</p>
<p>夫經過上述三道消化之食物，其消化完全者，由腸內膜之淋巴管轉入靜脈，歸納下大靜脈，而還流於右心房，而右心室，而肺臟，而左心房，而左心室，其消化不完全者，盡留腸內，變成糞便，排諸體外。至於已入左心室之原質，經大動脈而分佈於全身五臟六腑四肢百體，在此血液循環經過之中，如有障礙或血液補充消化力不足者，不能配給全身。其所配給全身五臟六腑四肢百體之消化食物，憑其固有機能，供給全身營養。如各臟器自身之機能不全，則其機能不全之髒贓器，勢必陷於枯死。况每一道消化，旣需相當勞力，又　相當時間，故勞力不能勝其任者，不能消化，時間短促者，亦不能消化。</p>
<p>由是以觀，可知食物，不在量之衆多而在消化力之完全。蓋多食而不消化，徒增口與胃腸之勞，而全身始終不能實受其益。語曰：少食多滋味，多食無滋味，蓋多食則疲於咀嚼，物理與化學的作用恒不完全，而消化自然不良也。試以實例證之：凡好食　物及食無頓節之兒童，每見面黃肌瘦，何者！物理學上之工作未盡，化學上之消化亦未得充分之時間也。然則補救之道維何？曰：莫善於養息消化之力，毋使疲勞過度，以期於適當時呈努力之功，即不可不食不可多食之間，厲行節食之道，非徒無害，而又益之也。不然，濫食無藝，貪食過度，必將陷於精疲力竭，而卒至消化機能全毀之危。世人味於此理，每促病人勉强進食者，實猶駕病馬而晝夜登程也，豈不殆哉。</p>
<p>消化之於營養有關，食物多寡之於消化有關，就學理而爲剖析，從消化能力而說到節食，際茲百物昂貴資源匱乏，偏購米購麵購一切食物，萬分艱難之秋，深知提倡節食，實無害於身體之健康，而有裨於經濟及物力之省節，眞可謂解決喫飯之問題矣。</p>

<h3>造船記</h3>
<p>每裝一枚帽釘，須用三人以上，此外並須鑚孔擴大，使之排列齊整，鍛接術却把道種繫劇的工作一概免除了。而且鍛接術尙有其他優點；牠能减輕船身的重量—平均减少百分之十三至十五。道樣不僅建造費可以减低，且使此船一生中的裝載量增加不少。有時鍛接術能使建造的時間大為縮短，更以油船為甚。油船的兩舷鑲板，比貨船或客輸上的較有規則，故可將鑲板先行配合，於岸上一起鍛接，再用起重機成塊吊至兩舷。某大造船廠已發明一種效力極大的鍛接機，每分鐘司將一吋的鑲板鍛接一呎，現在許多船廠中都已使用此種機器了．一艘一萬九千噸的油船，過去置於造船架上須六七月之久，用此機器，四個月即可下水•用鍛接術的構造力亦較用帽釘的爲强，因為帽釘是不能適合到百分之百程度的。帽釘實際的效率，有時在百分之八十五以下，而銀接則因完全鎔化之故，鑲板間不會有任何寧隙可尋。</p>
<p>鍛接術又鼓勵「初步的配合」，—例如船的隔壁，在地上工作較為便利，在陸上而不在船上作初步配合，又是二十年來造船業的另一重要改革。因為放平在地上，此吊在船上人手可以較多，故儘可能的在地面上做。而且在地面上「向下」鍛接，和把鍛接桿舉過頭頂，「向上」鍛接，亦容易得多．全部船首，把船身分成隔室的隔壁，和其他各部份，在今日都是製成後在地面上先行配合，然後再吊至造船架上作最後的鑲配。有時甚至龍骨尙未安置的船，其百分之五十巳先行裝配好了。</p>
<p>最新式的貨船或容輪，在表面上看來，和十年或十五年前的似無差別，巨大的進步，係在內部而不在外表，對於工率效能方面已有非常的改進•往復汽機的地位，幾已全由渦輪取而代之，所省燃料，不下百分之五十。速度亦巳增加，油船就是一個顯明的例子。牠的速度，五年來增加了百分之四十蓬五十。當其他油船的速率僅在十至十一海浬時，即已有速率達十九海浬的國防油船製造。司機人如能以最高速度行駛，便可因此賺錢。迄今新式商業油船的速度，也已增至千五海浬了。</p>
<p>第一次世界大戰時所造的船舶，其平均速度約為十一海里，而最近計劃的船，平均速度皆在十五海里半以上，結果以前須用四艘船担任的運輸工作，現在祇須三艘便够了。改良後的裝貨聯動機，亦巳减少起卸貨物的時間，而使兩艘新船耶能抵過三艘舊船。有許多航輸具有兩倍於舊式船舶的效率，航海速度固然提高，即燃料及修理方面亦較經濟，起運貨物的時間亦較節省。</p>
<p>船隻的的狀亦有變更，使在水中推進更易，每噸凈重所需的馬力較少，每匹馬力的機器重量亦有减縮，故可以較小的地位容納機器，而載運搭客的地位因之增加。空氣調節的應用已較前為廣，救生設備的效率已較前提高，船員和搭客的衛生狀况亦有改善。雷氣設備已廣泛應用，在新式船舶中，幾乎除主要引幣外無一不由電力控制。防火物質亦已使用較廣，故火險减少搭客和船員的安全亦大見增高樂。</p>
<p>納爾遜說，人與物質的效能，如三與一之此。良好的水手，和幹練的船員，排成一艘船舶。近年來美國航業的最大障礙，即為海員訓練之缺乏。激烈的運動已在船上獲得立足地。假使說這本由「流行船上的惡劣狀况」所引起，那是不應再有存在餘地的。船員宿所已澈底革新，所耗金錢達一百五十萬獎元以上，新委任的船隻上的船員宿所，在任何航海國家的歷史中都可首屈一指—有幾個老水手說，這種舒服的宿所，眞使人飄飄欲仙，新式船舶有游戲室，也有廣大船員宿所，一室中難得有兩三個船員同住，薪資甚高，水手們平均除大部份生活費用之外，每應尙可得九十元以上的收入，其優厚可以概見一斑了。（完）</p>

<h3>「四姊妹」中的四個姊妹</h3>
<p>— 薇</p>
<p>——沈浩——陳琦——張帆——莎莉</p>
<p>「四姊妹」是一個抒情的悲喜劇，劇作者用着他智慧的筆，巧妙地將四姊妹的個性行動，予以開展，由於她們之間個　性的不同，因之而交織許多曲析的情節。「四姊妹」像一盅淸冽的竹葉靑，渾成自然，看了會使你陶醉，叉使你愉快，像整個的心胸被洗滌了一樣的淸澈。</p>
<p>在現今的劇壇上，要尋四姊妹倒是難事，因爲一有差失　，就將影響全劇，這一次他們的陣容是沈浩的大姐，陳琦的二姐，張帆的三姐，莎莉的四妹，確實是珠聯璧台，蔚爲大觀，因爲她們都是有聲名的演員。</p>
<p>沈浩巳經好久不演戲了，當劇藝社在璇宮的時候，她演過「賽金花」，後來「海國英雄」，她也參加演出，這一次她的再獻身舞台，她是抱必成之志的，同時大姐對於她的性格，也很相同，演出上一定不會弱於任何人的。</p>
<p>咱家的二姊是一個唯摩登是尙的人，由小東西陳琦演，小東西近來不小了，她自從「明末遺恨」串演以後，演技上已經有很大的進步；觀其在電影上的造就，我相信這一次一定會達到特殊的成功。</p>
<p>而張帆那一定是讀者最熟悉不過，她在飾樓怪人一中初試新聲，已經博得很多人的贊美，這一次演三姊是一個男孩子型的女孩子，正像她自己邶樣的一副小防脾氣哩！</p>
<p>至於莎莉在「楊貴妃」「鐘樓怪人」都有她的演出，成績也並不弱於那些享盛名的人，這樣的四個姊妹，旣合乎了我們的理想，更加路珊，喬奇，葉小梅，仇銓合作，這一次的盛况，是可以預卜的。</p>
<p>而「四姊妹」這一個戲，講述家庭的轉變，跟「雷雨」風光差不多，但是題材絕異，它某部份素村是取之「小婦人」「四千金」，但是整個的劇情在悲哀興奮詼諧中進行，使我會有十分的回味，感到特別的曲折呢！</p>
<h3>蓓蒂黛維絲　自述巧遇</h3>
<p>— 甘單</p>
<p>大槪在十年前，我的母親從波士頓趁火車到紐約去，當一個女子抱著一隻狗上來時，座位已經坐滿了。因爲她帶了一隻狗，沒有人願意給她坐在旁邊，他們把包裹擠着座位來阻礙她。</p>
<p>母親是很愛狗的，她便移開些位子給這女子坐，不久她們便交談起來了。</p>
<p>母親非常自傲地吿訴她的新朋友，說她的女兒已經在百老匯裏當一個小角色，她是二個「偉大的藝人呢」。你想，母一親是有著那麽熱望呀！</p>
<p>這女子吿訴母親，說她當新聞記者有十二年之久了，她很想將來寫出一齣眞實性的劇本，或者一本書來。</p>
<p>到了紐約，母親和道女子大家都不曾介紹自己，而大家却說她自己的夢想和志願——這女子說的是自己，而母親說的却是我。</p>
<p>沒多時，母親和我同到好萊塢，起先，我極力想獲得一個位置，可是都沒有成就。有一天喬治亞里給我在“The　Man　Who　Prayed　God”裏當一個角色，從此，我便得到職務了。</p>
<p>一天，在我主演「再生緣」的時候，母親到攝影塲找我，那時我很想她會見「再生緣」的作者李翠菲爾，但當我正想介紹時，她却走過佈景那邊去見這位老朋友了。</p>
<p>「自從那天我們在火車上相見後，我常常都想起你」，我聽見母親說：「你在好萊塢幹些什麽呢」？</p>
<p>「你不知道麽？我寫了一本書，他們買來拍電影了，我是在這兒參觀的，那末你呢，吿訴我你的女兒怎樣了」。</p>
<p>她就在這裏呀！我請你會會她——蓓蒂黛維絲，但是我還不知道你的名字哩」！</p>
<p>「我叫李翠菲爾」。</p>
<p>奇怪得很，往往一次平常的遇見，當她們再會晤時，在生命卜是有著怎樣興奮啊！</p>

<p>（十四）王熙春</p>
<p>秦淮河的歌女裏出了兩個人村，一個是王玉蓉，一個便是王熙春了。當王熙春初到上海的時候，頗有人以此爲譏諷的口實，眞無聊得可以使人　笑，安見歌女就不能下海唱戲呢？這於王熙春的本身，實亦無所損害，故此後來也就無人再舉起來談了。熙春扮相很美，台上的風度亦好，倒極似金素琴的影子。雖然她的「聲」，「色」，「唱」，「做」，一切都遜於金素琴一籌，然而江南這許多坤伶旦角中，惟獨她纔堪居於金素琴之亞，算得是塊好戲料。她唱戲之外，父忙着拍電影，主演的片子不少。儼然一個明星，深恐長此下去，她沒有學戲的時間與機會了。以古諺「逆水行舟；不進則退」來譬喩，未免要阻碍她京戲上向上的前途哩。</p>

<p>「我咬一咬牙齒，嘴裹不說，心裏在想：你們這些東西，有時說人話，有時說鬼話，現在倒又說官話，從前景陽岡打虎的武都頭武松，就是恨着你們這些東西。又恰恰前面是一條橋，走在橋上，肩膀磕一磕，一個下去，掉在河裏了：飛起左脚，又一個下去了：飛起右脚，又一個下去了；仲左手，又一個：仲右手，却伸了一個空，因爲他們只有四僩人，我的手倒是白伸。」</p>
<p>黃龍眞說的有聲有色，說到對付警察，就站起來表演，伸手伸腿，就像是練把式。維城閉了眼在聽黃龍說話的，聽到了這裏，不禁睜限問道：「後來怎麽樣？」他問了這麽一句，又把眼皮闔上了。黃龍條的把酒杯合在臉上，笑道：「後來我跑了。但是維城哥，據說跑是跑不了的，依然花了我許多錢，才得平安無事。又一次……」黃龍坐到椅子裏，看維城朦隴着眼，他使變更論調道：「好，你睡一會，換了地方反而要睡不著的，你睡你的覺，我喝我的酒。」他把一個玻璃酒瓶，提在手裏試了一試輕重；又放在燈下，一眼閉一眼張，看了一看多少；不甚看得出，便把來搖晃了一下，聽見有響聲，裂着嘴一笑；把酒倒在酒杯裏，看着擁起來的酒花又一笑。</p>
<p>他正要嘴凑上去喝，只聽得板壁突然發出聲尖銳的聲音，這聲音便像有人拿鞭子猛打了一下。黃龍雖然從來不怕什麽鬼怪的，可也有些驚異，望了門口問道：「誰？喜鵲麼？我喝酒，不是喝你的，喝維城哥的，喝伯母的，不與你相干，你看我喝，我喝了，你再這麽一下，我就佩服你。」他又是舉起酒杯來合在臉上。維城從藤椅上坐了起來道：「你和誰說話？我睡得糊裏糊塗的，好像聽到一響。」黃龍把酒杯往桌子上重重的一放，酒還在喉嚨口，便答話道：「是的，一響。」維城道：「房子舊了，常常會這麽一聲，天雨不會有，天晴就有。要聽在我嬸娘耳朶裏，她又會說是母親來顯靈。啊，母親，我就是從昨天起沒有母親了：你也是的：我那同學，姓陳的同學，也是的。（四七）</p>

<h3>U.S. Representative Actively Mediates; Optimism in British-Indian Negotiations; Nehru and Johnson Meet Again; Indian Congress Party's Reply Expected Soon</h3>
<p>New Delhi, 10th (Reuters) – President Roosevelt's personal representative, Colonel Johnson, met with British Minister Cripps this morning for twenty minutes. It is also reported that Nehru met with Cripps for two and a half hours and then spoke with Colonel Johnson last night. Based on the current situation, it is expected that the replies from the National Congress Party and the All-India Muslim League Standing Committee will be submitted to Cripps today. After a meeting of the National Congress Party Standing Committee this morning, Chairman Acharya told reporters that the Congress Party's reply is expected to be sent to Cripps tonight. The National Congress Party Standing Committee will reconvene this afternoon.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 9th (Havas) – According to news tonight, the Indian National Congress Party will reply to the new British proposal by the 10th or 11th at the latest. Although no official information has been released regarding the negotiations, Sir Cripps may issue a formal statement tomorrow. It is also reported that one aspect of the compromise proposed by President Roosevelt's personal representative, Johnson, to Nehru is the establishment of an Indian National Government, with all matters related to civil defense and mobilization handled by the Indian government. However, Indian military affairs will remain the responsibility of General Wavell. In addition, the American compromise has other clauses, representing President Roosevelt's last-hour solution, which involves implementing a parliamentary system and granting a certain degree of autonomy to the Indian provinces. According to sources close to Sir Cripps, the prospects for negotiations are now more optimistic.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 10th (Reuters) – Doubts have arisen today regarding the success of Cripps's negotiations with the Congress Party. It is said that the detailed explanations provided today regarding changes to Cripps's original proposal have been met with dissatisfaction by many members of the Congress Party Standing Committee. The final decision of the Standing Committee is expected to be announced soon.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 10th (Reuters) – The Muslim League Standing Committee continued its discussion today on the wording of its reply to be submitted to Cripps. The meeting will continue tomorrow. After the Muslim League Standing Committee meeting today, Chairman Jinnah met with Cripps.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 10th (Reuters) – The Standing Committee of the Hindu Mahasabha has scheduled a meeting in New Delhi on April 14th.</p>
<p>Washington, 10th (Reuters) – According to the Washington Post, President Roosevelt's personal representative to India, Colonel Johnson, is becoming increasingly involved in the Indian issue, demonstrating the United States' deep concern for the British-Indian negotiations. This concern extends not only to facilitating a British-Indian agreement but also to the details of the agreement. India's national destiny is so closely linked to that of the United States, and India's gateway is so critical to American security, as if it were America's border.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 10th (Reuters) – British envoy Cripps has been negotiating with Indian political leaders for sixteen days. While compromise may still take some time on the Muslim side, understanding seems imminent on the Indian National Congress side. The Standing Committee of that party spent almost the entire day yesterday discussing the details of the agreement. The Muslim League Standing Committee also discussed for over seven hours yesterday, and may submit a reply to Cripps today regarding the new British proposals. Cripps met with National Congress leaders Acharya and Nehru for over two hours yesterday. Cripps is not expected to announce the overall results of the negotiations in the next two or three days.</p>
<p>Nehru Issues Declaration to Fight for Freedom</p>
<p>New Delhi, 9th (Reuters) – National Congress leader Nehru recently stated that Indians have always expressed admiration and warm friendship towards the United States. The United States is currently undertaking a great mission, and we hope the United States can complete its great task. However, I must express my surprise at the commentary in American newspapers. I believe this must be due to a lack of understanding of the situation in India by the American press. American newspapers have recently repeatedly offered instructive advice, stating what is beneficial and what is not beneficial to India, even threatening what will happen if we do not accept American advice. It must be known that the advice of friends is most valuable and should be considered most carefully. However, we are not accustomed to the protection of any other country, and our policies are not based on the teachings or threats of other countries. At this time when the world is in turmoil, we should discuss with each other and seek ways to achieve common goals. However, I wish to declare that we have not issued an appeal to anyone, nor have we invited anyone to mediate. As for myself, I believe that President Roosevelt is shouldering the most important task in the world, and with President Roosevelt's abilities and character, he is capable of fulfilling this great task. I am confident that President Roosevelt will play an important role in the future, but we have not asked him to mediate our problems, because we know that we have our own responsibilities that we must resolutely shoulder. For twenty-two years, we have never abandoned this arduous task, even though the other party is a powerful empire. Although we have endured hardships and suffered punishments, we have never wavered in the slightest. Regardless of the future, this purpose will not change. We yearn for freedom as if we were hoping for rain after a long drought. In the past, we have constantly worked hard for freedom. However, we understand that the realization of freedom in India is our responsibility. If our strength is more than sufficient to enable freedom to be realized, then we will rise up and realize our wishes. Otherwise, we will inevitably fail. What the final fate will be, everything depends on our own efforts. We welcome the cooperation of others to work together for a great cause, but in the future, we still need to rely on our own efforts and never rely on external assistance. This is our firm belief. President Roosevelt has expressed friendly concern for our current problems, and we are grateful for his kindness. However, to say that President Roosevelt has the responsibility to decide whether to mediate or not is unfair to both President Roosevelt and us.</p>
<p>Attitude of Various Indian Parties Towards the New British Plan</p>
<p>New Delhi, 9th (Havas) – British envoy Sir Stafford Cripps has sent letters to major Indian political organizations, inviting all parties to participate in the future Indian National Government and requesting their response on whether this cooperation is feasible. Here are the responses of the various parties: (1) The attitude of the National Congress is currently unknown. The leaders of the Congress, Acharya and Nehru, held long talks with Cripps this afternoon, but both sides refused to issue any statements. The Research Committee of the National Congress held a meeting tonight to discuss countermeasures and decided to continue the meeting at 8:30 tomorrow morning. (2) The Executive Committee of the Muslim League is also scheduled to meet tomorrow to discuss this matter. (3) The Hindu Mahasabha has reportedly submitted a reply to Cripps's proposal. The Chairman of the Mahasabha, Savarkar, visited the Governor of Bombay this afternoon, reportedly to inform him of the Mahasabha's attitude. In short, the Mahasabha still maintains an absolute opposition to the provision in the British proposal that allows Indian provinces to freely decide whether to join the federation, but it is very willing to participate in the new National Government. It is generally understood that the Mahasabha will hold two seats in the new government. According to Cripps, the Chairman of the Mahasabha, Savarkar, could not come to New Delhi today, so he sent the reply to the Governor of Bombay.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 9th (Reuters) – Cripps's negotiations with Indian political leaders have lasted for sixteen days. From the general public's perspective, the cautious attitude adopted by the leaders of the Muslim League may indicate that adjustments will take considerable time in the future. However, many believe that there is a great hope for Cripps to reach an understanding with the National Congress. It is believed that the Standing Committee of the National Congress spent the entire day today holding the most detailed discussions and consulting with Cripps and President Roosevelt's personal representative, Johnson, in order to obtain the greatest assistance in seeking a solution. The Standing Committee of the Muslim League is expected to submit a reply to Cripps tomorrow regarding the British Declaration and new principles of national defense. The committee discussed the two previous proposals for more than seven hours today. It is reported that the committee will express dissatisfaction with the part of the proposal concerning the future of India. It is believed that the committee will support Jinnah's demand, advocating that the British side recognize the "Pakistan" system in clear language. The committee recalled that Cripps stated that the proposal should be accepted or rejected in its entirety. In view of the past opposition of the Muslim League to Cripps's proposal, they wish to know clearly whether there is room for discussion regarding the current measures in the proposal. The committee reiterated their willingness to participate in the government, but only if they can obtain a real share of power in the government. It is expected that Jinnah will meet with Cripps again tomorrow to discuss the points raised by the committee.</p>
<p>Major Obstacles to Negotiations Still Need to be Overcome</p>
<p>London, 10th (Reuters) – Cripps has overcome one of his greatest difficulties, but it is premature to say that a solution is in sight. He has decided to remain in New Delhi and postpone the publication of his scheduled statement. Observers have noted that the atmosphere in India has improved. Firstly, due to Cripps himself, he is about to build a bridge between the gap between the Indian National Congress and the British government. Secondly, the new infusion of realism into Indian politics, the main leaders of Indian nationalists are clearly studying constructive solutions. Thirdly, Cripps has made the world aware of the nature of the Indian problem and the constructiveness of British policy. World opinion, especially the general sentiment in the United States, can agree with the practical action proposals proposed by Britain. This will definitely help the success of the negotiations. However, because there are still major obstacles to overcome at present, all parties should maintain cautious optimism in the coming weeks.</p>
<h3>Christmas Island Occupied by Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Domei) – Japanese naval marines, with the cooperation of the air force, occupied British Christmas Island on the morning of March 31st without resistance. The island is located 220 nautical miles south of the Sunda Strait (between Java and Sumatra) and is an important location in the Indian Ocean. The island is administratively under the British Straits Settlements, with an area of approximately 60 square miles. The entire island is made of limestone and is very lush. The surrounding area is 35 kilometers, almost entirely cliffs, lacking good harbors. Of the tropical trees, only Flying Fish Cove on the north shore is the only port. The population is about 1,200, of which only 30 are Europeans. The island is rich in minerals, with reserves of up to 90 million tons.</p>

<h3>Japanese Advance on Bataan Peninsula; U.S. Forces Implement Scorched Earth Tactics; General Wainwright Ordered to Respond Opportunistically; Corregidor Fortress Heavily Bombed</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Domei) – The Japanese army is using modern weapons to launch an offensive on the Bataan Peninsula from land, sea, and air. After capturing Limay and Layac on the east coast yesterday morning, Japanese troops from all directions are advancing rapidly towards Mariveles, a major American base at the tip of the Bataan Peninsula. The surrounded Filipino-American allied forces under General Wainwright are hastily retreating from the second line of defense. Yesterday afternoon, Japanese planes conducted extensive reconnaissance, discovering that the Mariveles airfield was heavily bombed by Japanese planes, resulting in a widespread fire. In the area north of Mariveles, enemy troops were seen withdrawing south, in a rather chaotic state. The vanguard of the Japanese army advanced south and, after occupying Limay yesterday morning, attacked Layac, forcing the enemy to flee to the Mariveles area. It is reported that the enemy has been overwhelmed by the heavy bombing of the Japanese air force, resulting in the surrender of several thousand in the Limay and Layac areas. One strong Japanese force cut off the highway between Limay City and Limay Mountain at around 10:00 yesterday morning, capturing a large number of American and Filipino soldiers, including the commanders of the 21st Division and the 22nd Regiment. Limay is located in the southeast of the Bataan Peninsula, facing Manila Bay. The American army was unable to resist the fierce Japanese attack and was forced to abandon the city. The Japanese army completely occupied the area on April 8th at 12:45 PM. Yesterday, Limay was still shrouded in thick smoke, indicating that the enemy had implemented a scorched earth tactic, burning several important buildings in the city. Other Japanese units advanced south along the east coast of the Bataan Peninsula, occupying the strategic city of Cabcaben on the coast of Manila Bay shortly after noon yesterday, and are currently pursuing the retreating American forces. The airfield and military facilities in the city, as well as the road to the south, have been destroyed by the retreating enemy. Black smoke can be seen rising everywhere along the southern coast of the Bataan Peninsula. At the same time, Japanese planes braved intense anti-aircraft fire twice to heavily attack the Corregidor fortress, dropping many tons of bombs on military facilities, causing heavy damage. Heavy smoke fills the sky over Manila Bay. According to news from the front lines, after being driven out of Limay, American and Filipino troops are retreating along the highway towards Mariveles, and small transport ships are being assembled at Los Cochinos Point at the southern tip of the Bataan Peninsula to transport troops to the Corregidor fortress. However, the Japanese Navy is currently blocking the enemy's escape route to Corregidor Island.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Domei) – According to London radio, with the American and Filipino forces on the Bataan Peninsula in dire straits, President Roosevelt instructed Commander-in-Chief General Wainwright to take any measures he deems necessary.</p>
<p>Washington, 10th (Havas) – According to responsible sources, the Corregidor Island fortress in Manila Bay was heavily bombed by Japanese planes today, but the defenders are still resisting.</p>
<p>Washington, 10th (Reuters) – Secretary of War Stimson told foreign reporters yesterday that, according to a report from General Wainwright, commander of the American and Filipino forces in the Philippines, on Wednesday of this week, there were a total of 26,853 soldiers operating on the Bataan Peninsula at the time of the report. This number does not include the garrisons on the Corregidor Island fortress in Manila Bay and other islands. It is almost certain that these soldiers have not received air support lately, and the outcome has been predetermined. At the beginning of the war in the Philippines, there were approximately 5,000 air force personnel in the area. Subsequently, due to planes being destroyed or transferred to the Dutch East Indies and Australia, 2,000 of these air force personnel were reorganized into infantry. In addition, the losses of air force personnel have been very heavy.</p>
<p>Washington, 9th (Reuters) – Secretary of War Stimson said that except for the small groups of isolated troops in the defense of the Corregidor fortress who are constantly raiding the Japanese in northern Luzon, Mindanao, and other places, he does not believe that they will stop fighting. Generals Macworth and Wainwright have wholeheartedly praised the bravery of the Filipino troops who resolutely defended the Bataan Peninsula. Stimson continued that President Roosevelt sent a letter to General Wainwright, expressing his understanding of the many difficulties encountered by Wainwright and praising his courageous command of the defending troops. The defending troops have recently lacked air support, so their outcome was in fact expected early on.</p>
<p>Manila, 8th (Domei) – The Japanese army ×× unit attacking the enemy's first line of resistance on Mt. Samat on the Bataan Peninsula broke through the highway from Balanga to Bagac on the afternoon of the 4th and occupied the enemy's main positions in the foothills of the mountain. The fierce attack continued from the morning of the 7th, with the joint cooperation of land and naval air forces and ground artillery units. The fighting was extremely fierce, and Mt. Samat was completely occupied at 12:40 PM. The enemy's main forces have begun to retreat completely.</p>
<h3>British Aircraft Carrier Sunk Near Ceylon; Other Ships Also Suffered Significant Losses</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Domei) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM today that Japanese naval forces and air units in the Indian Ocean near Ceylon yesterday sank the British aircraft carrier "Hermes" (10,850 tons), a "Birmingham"-class cruiser (9,100 tons), and an "Emerald"-class cruiser (7,550 tons). They also severely damaged a "Leander"-class cruiser (7,270 tons). It is also reported that a destroyer, a merchant ship, and six other ships were sunk. 46 planes were shot down, and 6 were destroyed on the ground. The Japanese side lost 10 planes, with no loss of warships.</p>
<p>London, 10th (Havas) – The Admiralty has announced that the British aircraft carrier "Hermes" of 10,850 tons was sunk by Japanese aircraft approximately ten miles off the coast of Ceylon. Most of the sailors were rescued and landed ashore. This ship was built during the last European war and was equipped with six 5.5-inch guns and three 4-inch anti-aircraft guns. Its maximum speed was 25 knots per hour.</p>
<h3>Air Raid Alert in Washington</h3>
<p>Washington, 9th (United Press) – An air raid warning was issued here at 10:40 PM today, lasting for thirty-six minutes. The reason is unknown. As a rule, this warning is issued whenever an aircraft of unknown nationality passes through the area.</p>
<h3>New Lenin Monument in London</h3>

<h3>Key British and American Figures in London to Discuss Important Military Strategy Issues; Focusing Attention on Unified Military Command; Supreme Atlantic Military Committee to be Established</h3>
<p>London, 9th (Havas) – General Brooke, Chief of the General Staff of the Army, met with General Marshall, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, today. Air Chief Marshal Portal, Admiral Pound, and other important generals will participate.</p>
<p>Switzerland, 9th (Havas) – According to London news reported by various newspapers, General Marshall, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, and Harry Hopkins, Special Envoy for Lend-Lease, are now in London, holding talks with British military authorities to discuss various important military strategy issues, which will inevitably involve the issue of how to take action on the European continent in the future. It was generally unexpected that these two would visit London this time, and their movements were secretive, so there are many rumors and speculations. There are several indications that they will discuss various important issues with British military and political figures. For example, the "Neue Zürcher Zeitung" reported that action on the European continent will inevitably be a part of the overall strategy, so military leaders from Britain and the United States will focus their attention on the issue of unified military command. Generally, the two countries will establish a Supreme Atlantic Military Committee, similar in nature to the current Supreme Pacific Military Committee, and General Marshall is the most suitable candidate to take on this task. However, any decision on military action must depend on how well military equipment can be produced. Therefore, before the situation can be considered satisfactory, there are still many difficulties that must be resolved. Regarding the United States, the U.S. has already submitted a detailed report on the conversion of the country's automobile industry to military industry, but it is still necessary to accelerate the manufacture of mechanical tools needed to increase military equipment production. Regarding this matter, Hopkins will conduct talks with British Minister of Production Lyttelton. At the same time, the two will also participate in military talks, because military equipment production is closely related to operations.</p>
<p>Washington, 9th (Havas) – The sudden arrival of Army Chief of Staff General Marshall and President Roosevelt's confidant and Lend-Lease Special Envoy Harry Hopkins in London is quite mysterious, and military and political circles refuse to comment on the meaning of this trip. It is only said that after Hopkins' previous trips, the government would inevitably make decisions on military or political matters, so this time will be no exception. It is reported that the Lend-Lease Act was passed after Hopkins' first mission to London, and the meeting between President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill in the Atlantic last July was also arranged by Hopkins.</p>
<h3>Area Around Suez Canal to Become Second Battlefield; British Forces in North Africa Repulse Axis Tank Unit</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Domei) – The "Yomiuri Shimbun" published a dispatch from the Argentine capital stating that the London Observer believes that the Allied second line of defense against the Axis powers will be centered around the Suez Canal, and not in Europe, because the United States cannot send a large army to Europe. The planned second line of defense will use the Suez Canal as its base to cut off Axis communications.</p>
<p>Western Libyan Desert Area, 9th (United Press) – A British military correspondent reported that British artillery has completely defeated the Axis' dense tank force, which was apparently attempting to begin a spring offensive towards Egypt. According to reconnaissance reports, Axis tanks are still hovering near the desert area, implementing a deceptive plan. Enemy aircraft were very active, but now have suddenly disappeared, which is particularly noteworthy. From what I have heard, enemy aircraft are now active along the coast, attempting to lure British aircraft to pursue. All indications suggest that an imminent offensive is coming. Both sides have moved their main forces into battle positions. The current weather is very good for large-scale warfare. From what I have seen, the British Air Force has the upper hand.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Oshima, Tours Southeastern Europe; Claims the Trip Has No Political Purpose</h3>
<p>Rome, 9th (Havas) – The General Headquarters has just issued a war report stating: (1) On the Cyrenaica front in North Africa, Axis forces have recently retaken many positions. Although the enemy launched a counterattack today, they were repulsed. (2) When enemy aircraft attacked Yello, one was shot down by our side. (3) Axis aircraft bombed the Egyptian port of Alexandria again, with good results.</p>
<h3>Large Squadron of British Planes Bomb Hamburg</h3>
<p>London, 9th (Havas) - The Air Ministry announced that a large squadron of British planes bombed military targets in northwestern Germany and the port of Hamburg last night. The shipyards in Le Havre, France, were also bombed. Furthermore, our coastal torpedo planes attacked enemy convoys in the waters near Jutland yesterday afternoon. Six of our planes have not returned to base.</p>
<p>Bucharest, Romania, 9th (Havas) - Japanese Ambassador to Germany, General Oshima, recently embarked on a tour of Southeastern Europe and arrived here yesterday. He told reporters that his trip to Southeastern Europe has no political purpose. He merely wishes to experience firsthand the current situation of the countries that have signed the Axis Pact. In recent years, significant political and ideological changes have occurred worldwide, and new nations have emerged, establishing new national groups, endlessly. The Romanian people have entered a new era of national life. Your country's strength has deeply impressed me. Japan and its allies are fighting to establish a new world order, striving to ensure that all nations can achieve peace and practical benefits. I firmly believe that we will win this war. The Tripartite Pact unites us, going beyond a mere military alliance. Anglo-Saxons often use Japan's and its allies' economic difficulties as propaganda material; this is mere bluster. Japan has already prevented the Anglo-Saxon countries from gaining a foothold in the Far East. This is an undeniable fact. Japan's significant power will undoubtedly contribute greatly to the establishment of a new world order. According to reports, Oshima is scheduled to travel to the capital of Bulgaria tomorrow and then to Athens.</p>
<p>Bucharest, 10th (Haitong News Agency) - Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Oshima, en route to the Bulgarian capital, passed through here. Yesterday afternoon, he addressed Romanian and foreign reporters at the hotel, saying, "My trip to Southeastern Europe has no political mission. It is purely a private trip to examine the general conditions of the Danube and the Balkans. I visited Romania in 1937, but significant changes have occurred since then. Under the leadership of General Antonescu, the Romanian people have entered a new era. I have been deeply impressed by Romania's new development. Japan, along with Germany, Italy, and the countries of the Tripartite Pact, is striving for a new world order and believes that the Allied countries will achieve final victory and successfully resolve economic problems. Anglo-American propaganda about the Allied countries' economic difficulties is pure deception. Japan's economic position in the Far East has been consolidated and can help establish a new world order." Oshima stated that he would travel to Sofia on Saturday and then to Athens, from where he would go directly to Berlin at four o'clock.</p>
<h3>Rumor of Germany Tempting Turkey to Join the Axis</h3>
<p>Washington, 9th - News from Berlin has attracted the attention of US Secretary of State Welles today. It is rumored that the Turkish envoy in Berlin will bring a German plan back to Ankara, preparing to grant Turkey certain rights in exchange for Turkey's joining the Axis. It is said that Syria will be the main territory that Germany gives to "friendly" Turkey. When reporters asked Mr. Welles if there was any confirmation or other news about this, he replied that it might be true. The German government never makes such promises when they are detrimental to themselves. The other party often finds that Germany intends to gain the benefits itself.</p>
<p>Rome, 9th (Havas) - The Carlino newspaper carries news from the Turkish capital that New Zealand troops stationed in Syria have recently concentrated near the Turkish border.</p>
<h3>Turkey's Moat</h3>
<p>On the side of unwillingness, it is because the Turks lost many small states after the last European war, suffering considerable losses. Perhaps they want to take advantage of the Germans this time to recover their territory. This reason is not very solid, because the opinion of the Turks is that the democratic countries have no territorial ambitions towards Turkey, while Germany is different. In that case, if the Germans want to pass through, the Turks can only resist. However, Turkey is a small country, and all its forces combined are only 600,000 men. When Germany makes a move, it will be like Mount Tai crushing an egg. How dare the Turks resist? Regarding this point, the Turks' only view is "see which way the wind blows." In the Turks' eyes, if the Germans are confident in conquering the world, the Turks will naturally help Germany. Otherwise, the Turks are willing to sacrifice themselves temporarily as a moat. If they lose, they can retreat to the Asia Minor area. Behind them, the large armies of Britain and the Soviet Union are gathering in Iran, Iraq, and other regions. In the future, when rewards are given, they are not afraid of not being able to rebuild a brand new Turkey?</p>
<p>The above explains the possibility and impossibility of Germany's advance to the east. Now, let's jump to the northern advance front to take a look. The northern advance will be a fight to the death with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Soviet Union, this big bear, it really gives people a headache; people, Germans too.</p>
<p>When Hitler decided to fight the Soviet Union, it is said that none of the German generals and many experts behind the scenes agreed. Because of the three reasons mentioned earlier that it was necessary to fight, they ended up fighting. According to Hitler's brilliant military advisor Han Beini, this weather expert, if Moscow could be taken before the ground froze, it would be worth a try. Hitler besieged Leningrad on one side, and on the other side, he advanced to a location 70 miles from the Russian capital. However, just when it was within reach, heavy snow fell, greatly helping the Soviet Union. The audience is very familiar with this scene, so there is no need to repeat it.</p>
<p>Now, let's take a closer look at the play where the Germans are targeting the Soviet Union for a new offensive.</p>
<p>Even the Germans admire the Soviets' ability to withstand war, so there is no need to say more about strategy and bravery. In terms of weather, both the Germans and the Soviets can enjoy equal treatment during the six months of April, May, June, July, August, and September. However, after the ground freezes, it is only the Soviet Union's world. In terms of geography, the Soviet Union suffers on one hand, but also benefits on the other. However, the benefits are on the side of the Soviet Union. In terms of resources, with the endless assistance of Britain and the United States, it can be even more reassuring. What about manpower? It is said that 25 million soldiers can certainly be fine-tuned and applied. In addition, armed farmers, both men and women, are also fierce. Looking at it this way, although their strength is not much higher than Germany, at the very least, it can be said that they are equal to the enemy.</p>
<p>Looking at Germany, the maximum number of German soldiers is probably 15 million. Since the beginning of the war, the number of deaths and injuries is in the range of two to three million. In addition, a large part is scattered in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Italy, France, Norway, the Netherlands, the Philippines, etc.; therefore, the number of soldiers available for the "new offensive" must be greatly discounted. The air force is certainly very fierce, but during the bombing of London, it has already lost about 10,000 men. Although there are no statistics for the subsequent attacks on the Soviet Union and Crete, it must be assumed that the losses were not small. The production of airplanes and other military equipment is certainly also considerable, but there are many problems with raw materials. If it is not a quick victory, the hope of success is probably hard to say. Gasoline is an even more serious problem for the Germans. The United States accounts for 70% of the world's gasoline, and the Soviet Union accounts for 10%. Now, it is a question of how much the Germans have stored and how much they have obtained in the occupied areas. If it is not much, the future of the Nazis will probably be ruined by this point.</p>
<p>Given the situation of the two countries, how should we come to a conclusion? It is difficult for us to draw a conclusion, and I am afraid that this Nazi leader cannot determine the season when the "spring offensive" turned into a "summer offensive." This can prove this point.</p>
<p>Judging from the news on the newspaper, it seems that the Soviet Union is preparing for a general counter-offensive. After stabilizing the India issue, Britain will probably take the opportunity to come. Perhaps Hitler wants to see which way the wind blows before deciding?</p>
<p>Looking at the above points, there is a vague outline of this European drama. However, the audience must pay attention to one point: Hitler often likes to come up with shocking tricks. Why is the spring offensive so strange and inactive at the end of March? (Referring to the mobilization of troops for the new offensive). Why has the Turkish President repeatedly expressed his intentions in recent days? Why did an assassination attempt on German Ambassador von Papen occur in the Turkish capital some time ago? Why did British planes accidentally bomb the Turkish city of Milas? To find a clue from these traces, the audience must put down their binoculars and look at what is in front of them. Is there a "pincer movement" or a "barrel hoop formation" here? For example, if something happens in India, will Turkey's moat be able to stop the German army's eastward advance?</p>
<p>This drama is very lively. Whether or not to perform it depends on whether the actors on the stage are prepared to perform it that way. At the same time, it also depends on whether the United States, entrusted by the British, is actively organizing a team; whether the team is organized successfully, whether it is the right time to perform on stage, and what the results of the performance will be are the biggest factors determining Germany's new offensive.

<h3>German Submarines Active Along the U.S. Coast; Newly Invented Aerobic Engine Has Amazingly Long Range</h3>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 9th (Havas) - German submarines have recently been appearing off the coast of the United States, and their range is surprisingly long. The reason for this is probably that the country has invented a new type of engine. According to the Berlin correspondent of the Lausanne Daily, German submarines originally had two types of engines: a diesel internal combustion engine, used for surface navigation, and a pneumatic engine, used for underwater navigation. Now, both of these engines have been cancelled and replaced with an aerobic engine. There is no need to install heavy batteries in the submarine, so the space is wider and the weight is reduced. The submarine can use the electrolysis of seawater to generate the necessary oxygen from the special air pipes installed around it. It is said that this engine was invented before the current war, but because the heat was too high, the sailors felt very uncomfortable when navigating underwater. It was not until recently that a remedy was invented. This new engine can give submarines an unlimited range. This is why German submarines can operate for weeks at a time thousands of miles from their bases.</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Havas) - U.S. Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox made a statement yesterday saying that attacks by German submarines on American merchant ships have decreased. The local newspapers have criticized this, saying that after Knox's statement, thirteen ships were sunk by German submarines. This is a good lesson for Knox, as even though he has taken strict measures, American merchant ships are still suffering significant losses.</p>
<h3>Sweden's Five-Year Defense Plan; Strengthen Navy and Air Force</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 9th (Havas) - The Swedish government today submitted a five-year defense plan to the parliament and asked it to pass it quickly. The total cost of the plan is 380 million kronor (Swedish currency), an average of 75 million kronor per year, plus "special expenses" of 65 million kronor. The content includes: (1) Strengthening the Swedish Navy, with plans to build cruisers, heavy destroyers, coastal defense ships, and minelayers, each with dozens of ships. The form and number are kept secret. (2) Strengthening the Air Force, with plans to form 16 air squadrons, including 6 fighter squadrons, 6 bomber squadrons, and 4 reconnaissance squadrons.</p>
<h3>Rapid Progress of Chinese Industry in Recent Years</h3>
<p>Detroit, 9th - The Detroit News editorial today stated that Fang Xianting of the Nankai Institute of Economics in China is one of the most profound scholars in Asia. The National Planning Association of Washington will publish one of his papers, which states that China has unlimited manpower, which can be trained to become a great force in industry. China also has coal, tungsten, and other minerals, as well as rich mining areas. China has had great skills in industry since ancient times, and its industrial technology has also shown significant progress in recent years. After conducting a detailed review of these and other resources in his article, Fang raises the next question: What assistance can friendly countries provide for China's post-war industrialization? He points out the need for transportation, saying that railways and ships are essential. The war has awakened China's need for such equipment. The four and a half years of war have made China deeply feel the need for industrialization, and its impact is even deeper than the historical experience of advanced industrial countries for a century and a half.</p>

<h3>Bank Reserve Committee Redeems Damaged Banknotes and Pays by Transfer; Transfer Discount is Only a Temporary Phenomenon, Which Will Disappear Naturally When Money Supply Eases</h3>
<p>The United Committee of Banking and Money Exchange Members previously mediated the market and, after the Joint Bank Reserve Committee redeemed damaged banknotes, the trend of rejecting damaged banknotes in the market has subsided. It is reported that the total number of damaged banknotes redeemed by the committee is approximately 15 million yuan, and redemption continues to facilitate collection and settlement for various industries. However, the damaged banknotes redeemed by the member banks and money exchanges are credited to the accounts of the respective banks and exchanges and paid by transfer. At the same time, large-scale redemptions are restricted. The committee does not charge any fees for redemption and operates entirely in accordance with the redemption methods promulgated by the Issuance Reserve Committee, which is regrettable for the discounted redemption of general small money shops.</p>
<p>Interbank Transfers Have Ended</p>
<p>Since the Joint Bank Reserve Committee ended interbank transfers for member banks and money exchanges, the transfer deposits of the banks and money exchanges have been converted into transfer funds by the committee and cleared. Therefore, the chips circulating in the market are transfer and cash. Due to demand, there is a shortage of cash in the market, resulting in a transfer discount (i.e., a premium is required to exchange transfer for cash). The discount on the black market is as high as 30 yuan per thousand yuan, which is inversely proportional to the cash discount in the past.</p>
<p>Transfer Notes Are Only Allowed for Transfers</p>
<p>A reporter learned from the banking and money exchange industry yesterday that the transfer discount is entirely a matter of supply and demand and is unrelated to the overall financial situation. Moreover, the banks and money exchanges do not operate this discount business. Once the money supply eases, this discount phenomenon will disappear naturally. Currently, for payments, all transfer funds are paid with payment orders and bank drafts, and a stamp "This note is only allowed for transfer" is affixed to the note. If cash payment is specified and the household deposited cash, it will still be paid in cash.</p>
<h3>Allocation of Foreign Rice Increased</h3>
<p>The foreign rice designated by the Rice and Grain Office to be extracted from Siemens Warehouse, Taikoo Warehouse, and Fuxin Warehouse has been transported by the rice shops yesterday. Yesterday, the office continued to designate the Taikoo Warehouse alone to supply rice shops today. The amount allocated each time has recently increased, and the supply of door sales has also become smoother.</p>

<h3>Jinmen Maru Sails to Xiamen Today; More Than 100 People Get Half-Price Tickets</h3>
<p>The Jinmen Maru of the East Asia Shipping Company is scheduled to depart for Xiamen at 12 noon today. The 200 half-price cabin seats have been closed. The registration list has also been copied and sent by the Fujian Fellow Association. However, the number of people registering to return to their hometown is more than 280. After excluding more than 100 people who plan to transfer after going to Xiamen and have suspended their trip, there are only more than 130 people who have detailed addresses in Xiamen. The Fujian Fellow Association has received half-price tickets and resold them to the returning fellow villagers. These more than 130 people can board the ship today.</p>
<p>Ningbo Fellow Villagers Restricted from Returning to Shanghai</p>
<p>Since the authorities of the two concessions have been actively evacuating the population, many people have returned from Shanghai to their hometowns in Ningbo. According to the Ningbo Shanghai Association, Ningbo requires those returning from Shanghai to be registered in the household before they can apply to come to Shanghai; otherwise, they will be refused exit, without exception, to actively assist the Shanghai concession authorities in their main purpose of evacuating the population.</p>

<h3>Pawning Interest Increased, Term Shortened, and Storage Fees Increased; Pawning and Mortgaging are Extremely Difficult to Distinguish</h3>
<p>It has been reported that pawning in the city will shorten the term to six months starting in April and increase interest rates. Mortgaging will still have a term of twelve months, and the interest rate will remain the same. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, in addition to increasing the warehouse interest, the storage fee for pawning has also increased from 4% to 5% starting in April (mortgaging is 3%). Although the term interest has been changed to monthly interest, adding another 1% warehouse interest, the total monthly interest is 4%. It has been found that the storefront decoration of some pawning shops in the city is completely identical to that of mortgaging shops, making it extremely difficult to distinguish. Before the war, the mortgaging industry requested the competent authorities to prohibit pawning from hanging the word "当" (pawn) on their shop signs, but to no avail. Therefore, pawning shops hang a "This Pawnshop is a Member of the City Pawnshop Association" enamel sign in front of their shops for identification.</p>
<h3>Elderly Woman with a Fortune Targeted by Bandits; Five Criminals All Respectable Merchants; Extortion of 100,000 Unsuccessful, Arrested</h3>
<p>Yu Sun, an elderly woman in the city, is 61 years old and lives at No. 34, Lane 1157, Fuxu Road. Her husband is deceased, but she has inherited property worth tens of thousands of yuan in the city, which has been targeted by bandits. Xu Longyuan, 39 years old, the woman's nephew, a local and exchange worker living in Room 357, No. 260, Aiduya Road, heard that he had failed in speculation and was heavily in debt. He suddenly had evil thoughts, taking advantage of the woman's old age. He conspired with fellow addicts Fan Xifang (52 years old, from Haimen, a foreign cloth merchant living at No. 50, Dongxin Bridge), Yu Caibao (44 years old, from Wuxi, a leather merchant at No. 24, Xinglishun, Ningbo Road), Chen Jinsheng (30 years old, from Shaoxing, an employee of the French Water and Electricity Company, living at No. 2, Nancaotang Street, Luban Road, Nanshi) and Yu Guisheng in Room 437 of the Central Hotel. On the afternoon of the 7th of last month, at 3 pm, Xu and the other five went to the woman's residence with guns to extort 100,000 yuan. As a result, the woman settled with 700 yuan. Later, Xu and the others sent a letter to Yu Sun at the beginning of this month, asking her to send 100,000 yuan as previously agreed to Room 322 of the East Asia Hotel on Nanjing Road. The woman could not bear it anymore and reported it to the French police. Detectives Zhou Buguang and Yan Jinwen, together with the Public Concession Police, arrested Xu, Chen, Fan, and Yu Caibao at the East Asia Hotel. However, the main culprit, Yu Guisheng, was at large. The French police were secretly deployed and arrested Yu Guisheng at Yu's home on the day before yesterday. The case was investigated and a public prosecution will be filed against the defendants for the crime of intimidation and fraud.</p>
<h3>Concealing Opium Paste, Allegedly for Suicide</h3>
<p>Qian Mo, a 36-year-old Suzhou woman living at No. 157, Deshunli, Yuanchengli, Lafayette Road, French Concession, was stopped and searched by the French police's female search team while passing in front of the slaughterhouse on Mintiniyin Road at around 5 pm on the day before yesterday. Three opium pastes were found, and she was taken to the police station. According to her confession, she intended to bring the opium pastes back for suicide. The woman's mother's family has a large population and they all depend on the woman for a living. Now, because she is unable to maintain them, conflicts often arise and she has no choice but to resort to this extreme measure to end her remaining life, etc. The police chief ordered that she be detained for further investigation and verification of the facts.</p>
<h3>Salvation Army Stretcher Team Deployed to Rescue Dying Beggars, Providing Final Comfort to Fulfill Humanitarian Duty</h3>
<p>Starting from the 9th, the Salvation Army has begun implementing a new plan to aid the countless male and female beggars in this city. This new plan involves a mobile stretcher rescue team rescuing beggars on the streets who are on the verge of death. According to Colonel Walker, this plan does not intend to forcibly adopt all beggars, but rather to rescue those who are genuinely impoverished and unable to survive due to cold and hunger, as well as those who are already bedridden and will die within a night or two without assistance. Colonel Walker continued, stating that last winter, he had thoroughly understood the pitiful situation of homeless beggars, and many people had requested them to find ways to help men, women, and children who were indeed helpless and lying on the roadside. The stretcher rescue team does not intend to collect the bodies of the deceased, as this task is already the responsibility of the Pushan Cemetery. The team's work is to rescue those who are not yet dead and transport them to the Salvation Army Beggar Shelter at the intersection of Singapore Road and Hart Road. After these people arrive, perhaps half of them will still be beyond saving, but if this situation truly occurs, then at least their final hours or days can be spent peacefully. This mobile stretcher will be managed by two staff members of the beggar shelter. They will be stationed at the shelter, awaiting instructions from the Salvation Army headquarters at Sassoon House. As for the rescued beggars, after being transported to the shelter, they can be cared for by a formal physician and treated in a well-equipped hospital. The hospital has thirty beds.</p>
<h3>Over 7,000 Sublease Licenses Issued, Western District Has the Most, Central District Second, Landlords Who Fail to Obtain Licenses on Time Will Be Severely Punished</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Council began issuing sublease licenses on the 1st of this month, landlords have been very enthusiastic about obtaining licenses. The deadline for issuing licenses is the end of this month. Anyone who subleases surplus rooms should obtain a license as soon as possible to avoid punishment. The Datong News Agency reporter has recorded the following:</p>
<p>Total Number of Licenses Issued</p>
<p>The Municipal Council Building Tax Office (i.e., Central District) and the Northwest and East District branch offices have issued the following number of sublease licenses since the 1st of this month: 1,332 on the 1st, 1,533 on the 2nd, issuing was suspended from the 3rd to the 6th for the Easter holiday, 1,662 on the 7th, 1,598 on the 8th, and 1,539 on the 9th. The total number issued in all districts from the 1st to the 9th is already 7,664.</p>
<p>Comparison of Licenses Issued in Each District</p>
<p>Here is a comparison of the number of licenses issued in each district from the 1st to the 9th: Central District has issued 2,633, Western District has issued 2,995, Northern District has issued 1,305, and Eastern District has issued 731. Comparing the above numbers, the Western District has the most, followed by the Central District, and the Eastern District has the least. This is simply due to the density of housing.</p>
<p>Landlords Must Not Be Negligent</p>
<p>The Municipal Council has decided to end the issuance of these licenses at the end of this month and will conduct a strict investigation. If it is discovered that anyone has failed to obtain a license on time, they will be severely punished as a warning to those who are negligent. All license holders should fill out the license and sublease list forms and hang the license plate in a prominent place inside the house in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association Established</h3>
<p>There are dozens of rickshaw pullers in this city. Now, Wang Junyuan and others have organized a mutual aid association to seek connection and welfare. The association will elect supervisors and directors at 2 PM on the 12th of this month.</p>
<h3>Suicide Due to Livelihood Difficulties</h3>
<p>Chen A Yuan from Shaoxing, 29 years old, made a living by working. Recently, due to wages being insufficient to maintain his life, he had a pessimistic idea. At 10 PM the night before, he bought Lysol disinfectant and went to room 11 of the small inn at 342 Min Ti Ni Yin Road in the French Concession, where he committed suicide by swallowing it. The next day at 9 AM, the tea boy discovered and reported it to the police. He was taken to the hospital by car, but it was too late to save him. The body was collected and handled by the charity, awaiting relatives to claim it.</p>
<h3>YMCA Fundraising Nearing Closing</h3>
<p>The YMCA was founded by Chinese people. This year is the 42nd fundraising campaign of the association, which opened on March 18th. The goal this time is 250,000 yuan. It is reported that everything is proceeding smoothly, even though the market situation is difficult. The results have been announced three times in the past, and the results have been good, especially the donations. The amount still needed is about 50,000 yuan. The fundraising campaign will close on the 15th of this month. Yesterday, the association issued a final notice to collect all donations and membership fees in order to close on time.</p>

<h3>Beware of Rabid Dogs: The Appearance of Rabid Dogs</h3>
<p>During the transition between spring and summer, rabid dogs are most easily found. Infection to humans is called hydrophobia. Not only are the symptoms terrible, but they are also extremely painful. Generally, rabid dogs that have been infected are initially sluggish in movement and mentally abnormal. If they are depressed and have a reduced appetite, this state may last for several hours or up to one or two days. Suddenly, they become crazy, their barking changes suddenly, and their throats become hoarse. The sound is terrifying. They run wildly outside and bite people and objects they encounter. If they are locked in a cage, the wooden bars of the cage will be bitten and broken. Those who are bitten will all be poisoned. Therefore, when you see a dog running quickly towards you with its eyes staring straight ahead, shining brightly, its head and neck stiff, and drool flowing from its mouth, or if it is hanging its head and tail, walking slowly, or walking like a drunkard, staggering from side to side, as if it were drifting, and eventually its steps become slow and it becomes paralyzed, because its throat is spasming, its cough sounds evil, it frequently scratches its throat, its jaws are stiff, its teeth are cracked, and more saliva is produced, if it seeps into human skin, stomach or intestines, it will immediately cause poisoning. Therefore, not only being bitten by a rabid dog or having the poisonous liquid enter the skin, but also objects or trees that have been bitten by a rabid dog should not be used. Those who are poisoned by a rabid dog will experience an incubation period of at least one or two weeks and at most two or three months. Once the symptoms are obvious, treatment is difficult.</p>
<p>Treatment of Rabies</p>
<p>(A) The first Western method for treating rabies was invented by the French scientist Pasteur. It involves transplanting the spinal cord of animals poisoned with rabies from foreigners and making it into an emulsion, which is then inoculated into rabbits. The spinal cord of the rabbits is then transplanted into those suffering from rabies. However, Pasteur's medicine is not easy to preserve and is very troublesome to transport. Recently, there is the Semple method, which also uses the spinal cord of monkeys inoculated with rabies fluid, but its preparation method is very secretive. However, both are Western medicines, and in the current situation, there are concerns that they cannot be purchased. The next option is to use Chinese medical methods.</p>
<p>(B) Chinese Methods: Chinese therapies are based on those printed by Kong Xiang of Linpu Town, Xiaoshan, Zhejiang, because they have proven effective. There are two types: (1) External treatment (2) Internal treatment.</p>
<p>The formula for external treatment is: Dangmenzi qian (the best musk), Xiniu Huang two fen, Meihua Shui Pian one qian, Yaoxionghuang five fen, Zhi Nanshi five fen, with the following explanation:</p>
<p>Combination of Medicines</p>
<p>(1) Selection of Medicines: The main medicine in this formula is "Dangmenzi," but the Dangmenzi sold in ordinary pharmacies has true and false, good and bad qualities, and the quality is uneven. If you use the fake or inferior ones, the whole medicine will be ineffective, so be careful. The real Dangmenzi has uneven particles, large and small, the largest ones are like longan pits, darker than dark brown, and emit a moisturizing luster, with a fragrant aroma. If the color is dull, it is a fake product. There is also a type called Sanxiang, whose particles are the size of mung beans, even and equal, which cannot be used. Xiniu Huang is also an essential medicine in the formula. This medicine is shaped like a broken longan shell, and the color is similar. The middle is divided into layers, about two or three fen thick, and the texture is very light. The one with the most obvious color is the real one. If the block is not divided into layers and the color is dull, it is a fake. You can purchase medicine from famous pharmacies in major cities, but you must still examine whether each medicine matches the above description. (2) Combine the medicines using a fine porcelain mortar. First, grind the Dangmenzi, etc., and then add the ice chips. Grind into a powder with a light hand (if you use a heavy hand, the Dangmenzi, etc., will form a block with the ice chips). Alternatively, you can grind the ice chips separately and then add them. The finer the whole medicine is ground, the faster the medicinal effect. It takes about five or six hours of continuous grinding to complete, and it must be ground within one day to avoid excessive dissipation of the aroma. After combining, sieve it out with a double-layer fine silk sieve. (If the porcelain mortar and sieve, etc., are borrowed from the pharmacy, be sure to pay attention to their cleanliness). (3) Storage: The medicine must be stored in a one-fen bottle produced by a Chinese glass factory (do not use too large a bottle). The total weight of the medicine is three qian and two fen, which can be stored in about thirty-five bottles. Each bottle must be filled tightly with the medicinal powder. Seal the bottle stopper with yellow wax and store it in an airtight metal can. It should also be stored in a bottle when carrying it, not in paper packaging, because the aroma of this medicine is easily dissipated, and if the aroma is gone, the efficacy will be lost, so it should be stored tightly. Purchase enough for one year's use to avoid the medicine becoming stale and losing its effectiveness.</p>
<p>How to Use the Medicine</p>
<p>(A) Rabid Dog Bite: Use a silver needle to apply about half a grain of rice of the medicinal powder to the inner corner of the eye (left eye for men, right eye for women). For severe poisoning, apply to both eyes; for mild poisoning, apply to one eye. After applying, close your eyes and sit or lie quietly for half an hour. For those in the countryside who do not have clocks, use one burning incense stick as a standard (the eyes must be closed so that the medicine cannot move internally, so closing them more is best). Apply three times a day, and at least half a bottle must be used up. If there is still poison, then apply again. The method for testing the poison is found in the rabies bite taboo list (because the poison is not visible at the bite site, another method must be used to test it). (B) Snake Bite: The method of use is the same as in (A), but the poison of a dog bite often occurs after dozens of days, while snake venom is activated immediately. A few hours later, there may be drooling at the corners of the mouth, shortness of breath, dizziness, and fainting, which means the poison is severe. In addition to applying the medicine to the eyes, you should also take one-quarter of a bottle of this medicine internally at the same time. For emergencies, you can use half a bottle, taken with boiling water. If it does not heal, take it again. After taking it, there may be blood in the stool, or blood clots may be vomited. Generally, after the blood clots come out of the stool, the fainted person will wake up. If you still feel unwell after waking up, you can take the medicine daily, about the size of a tea bean, until you feel refreshed. Continue to apply eye medicine until the swelling at the affected area is completely gone. For snake bites, you must also avoid certain foods. The method is the same as for dog bites. For mild poisoning, stop when the swelling subsides; for severe poisoning, you must avoid certain foods for several days after full recovery (mild poisoning refers to no fainting or other symptoms, and only slight blurred vision is not considered severe). Also, for severe snake bites, if you cannot use medicine at the time, you can use an early opium pipe oil and take it with boiling water. Those with severe poisoning will feel that the taste is sweet and not spicy, so you can take it again until you feel the taste is spicy and then stop. Then use other medicines, which is also a good emergency treatment. (C) Sore Poison: The method of use is very simple, just apply the medicine to the mouth of the sore, which can draw out the poison and generate new flesh. The diseases that have been cured with this include anti-lip boils, snake eye boils, back boils, insect bites, ulcers, and other sore ulcers. However, according to traditional Chinese medicine, important sores are divided into yin and yang sores (the so-called yin sores are generally not red, swollen, painful, or itchy). This medicine is suitable for yang sores, but not for yin sores. Therefore, if you encounter important sores and it is difficult to distinguish between yin and yang, you must ask a doctor to identify them and do not use them without authorization. (D) Precautions: This medicine has been used to treat various diseases for nearly a hundred years, except for item (C). The methods and procedures are obtained from practical research and are all important. Please be sure to pay attention to them. Here is an example to illustrate this. In a certain year, rabies was rampant in Yiwu County, Zhejiang. A local philanthropist specially asked me for medicine and a prescription to take away, but those who were treated with the medicine that was taken away all recovered, while those who were treated with the medicine that was self-prescribed according to the prescription all died from the poison. After inquiring, it was known that the "Dangmenzi" that was purchased was Sanxiang (see the description in item 1). Therefore, if there are philanthropists who are happy to give this medicine, they must pay attention to the above four procedures (1), (2), (3), and (4), so as not to mislead the lives of patients. Also, pregnant women should not take this medicine, but if they are bitten by a real rabid dog or poisonous snake, then it is also not restricted.</p>
<p>Taboos</p>
<p>Those who are bitten by a dog should observe taboos in clothing, food, and housing in addition to applying eye medicine. Patients should carefully abide by them, otherwise, even if there is good medicine, it will be ineffective. (1) Avoid sexual activity, those who violate it will not be cured. (2) Avoid arguing with people and getting angry. (3) Avoid hearing the sound of metal instruments (such as gongs and bells) or other sounds that can shock the heart, or if you accidentally hear them, do not be afraid. Children must avoid being frightened. (4) Avoid overworking, but appropriate exercise or work is not restricted. (5) Avoid washing your face or body with cold water. (6) Avoid sleeping in a new ramie mosquito net or walking in a hemp field, and avoid wearing the clothes you were wearing when you were bitten. (7) Avoid steaming the patient's taboo foods on the rice pot, and even fresh vegetables are not suitable, let alone other things. It is best to cook the patient's food in a separate pot. (8) Avoid smelling irritating meats, vegetables, such as stinky, mutton, spicy, etc., and other strong smells (such as beef, mutton, vegetable oil, distiller's grains, etc., should not be smelled). (9) Avoid eating all foods that are not listed below. If you eat foods that promote inflammation, the poison will erupt immediately. Suitable foods to eat: Xian rice, late rice, salt, salted cabbage, dried salted cabbage, radish, dried radish, small dried fish (if mixed with dried shrimp or small yellow croaker, it is not suitable to eat), salted duck eggs, lotus seeds, almonds, water chestnuts, lotus roots, Ya pears, apples. (10) All of the above taboos must be carefully observed from the day of medicine application until 120 days, otherwise, it is often incurable. Be careful, be careful. Testing for poison and medicinal formula.</p>
<p>The method for testing for poison is to chew raw soybeans. If there is a raw, fishy smell, the poison is mild. If you eat cooked soybeans, the poison is severe. At first, test every other day or every three days, and then test every seven days. After 120 days, you don't have to test anymore. If the poison is severe, in addition to applying eye medicine, you can also take the following formula at the same time, or if you don't have eye medicine, you can take the following formula alone, but applying eye medicine is the most appropriate. If there is a fishy smell when chewing beans, you don't need to take it again, but don't think that because there is a fishy smell when chewing beans, the poison is mild and you don't observe the above taboos anymore, because it will cause endless troubles.

<h3>320,000 Yuan Robbery Case, Another Rickshaw Puller Arrested for Receiving 3,000 Yuan in Stolen Fare</h3>
<p>Regarding the shocking robbery that occurred at 7 AM on January 16th this year inside Lane 306, North Henan Road, in which four employees of Tianbao, Jinfeng, Bao Cheng, and other three Shanghai-based Zhuang stores located at No. 5, Lane 444, Jiujiang Road, were carrying</p>
<p>Three Small Suitcases</p>
<p>containing 323,000 yuan in legal tender, the Chinese detectives Feng Baishun and Huang Fusen of the Huaihai and Hongkou police stations, along with detective Chen Dabing, received a secret report and arrested Wu Xiaobao, the wife of Liu Xiao Ba Zi (from Jiangbei), who was a notorious robber killed by the Chinese police at the time. They seized 10,000 yuan in stolen money that she had received from the fugitive Xiao Gou Zi. They also arrested 15 men and women, including accomplices Xu Rushui and Xu Ajin from Jiangbei, suspected receiver Xu Changsong, and receiving women Zhang Liu Shi and Xu Zhu Shi. The two police stations jointly seized stolen money amounting to</p>
<p>More Than 60,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The remaining leaders, Zhao Deguang, Liu Rubiao, and Xiao Gouzi, fled to other ports with the money or returned to their hometown in Jiangbei, making it impossible to arrest them. The police filed a public lawsuit on charges of organized robbery. The case has been sent to court several times. The robbers confessed that when robbing the large sum of money, the ringleader was sitting in a black rickshaw with purple copper leaf trim and stopped the employees' rickshaw, who were carrying the money to Shanghai. They used the excuse that they were inspectors from a certain agency searching for contraband and dragged them into the lane to carry out the robbery. Now, Chinese detective Chen Dabao of the police station, during a re-investigation, arrested</p>
<p>Yu Jinhai</p>
<p>a rickshaw puller from Jiangbei who pulled the ringleader's rickshaw at the time. Yesterday, he and the other male and female suspects, including Wu Xiaobao and Xu Rushui, were sent for interrogation together. The lawyer representing the police station requested that the case be closed and that the suspects be severely punished. According to the confession of the defendant, rickshaw puller Yu Jinhai, he was waiting for passengers in the area of Xiaocai Chang, Peng Road, when an unknown person came and asked him to wait at the east end of North Henan Road. Later, the defendant Xu Ajin ran to him, sat down, and asked him to pull to the vicinity of Gongping Road and Tangshan Road in Hongkou. He gave him a yellow paper package containing 3,000 yuan in legal tender as fare. He claimed that he did not witness the large robbery, and his remaining statements were evasive. The lawyer Fan Gang, representing the defendant Xu Changsong, made a defense. All were still returned to custody. It is heard that the verdict in this case will be announced on the 17th.</p>

<h3>Vegetarianism</h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>Eating is difficult! Eating is difficult! This has now become a major problem for the masses. To solve this problem, one must consider both the practical and theoretical aspects. Human food, whether it be delicacies from the mountains and seas, or rice, beans, vegetables, and fruits, its main components are always no more than three kinds: starch, protein, and fat. Once these foods enter the mouth, they must undergo three stages of digestion.</p>
<p>The first stage of digestion is digestion in the oral cavity. Oral digestion is divided into physical digestion and chemical digestion. The former is a physical action, namely the work of chewing with teeth. Chewing more results in finer and easier-to-digest food, while chewing less results in coarser and harder-to-digest material. The latter is a chemical action, namely the secretion of a liquid substance called saliva from the parotid gland, sublingual gland, and submandibular gland, which can gradually decompose starch. Therefore, excessive food intake leads to a feeling of insufficient saliva, and the food consumed cannot be completely digested, which is due to incomplete saliva secretion. However, food cannot remain in the mouth for a long time due to incomplete saliva secretion, and it must be swallowed and enter the stomach. Then begins</p>
<p>The second stage of digestion, which is digestion in the stomach. Digestion in the stomach is also divided into physical digestion and chemical digestion. The inner lining of the stomach is very rough and wrinkled, and through the stretching and contracting action of the muscles, it can repeatedly stir and grind the food, further physically digesting the food that was not completely chewed in the oral cavity. Therefore, if the stomach wall is weak or its movement is incomplete, the digestion of food will be poor. However, the inner lining of the stomach also has glands that can secrete a liquid that initiates chemical action, called gastric juice, to break down proteins in the food. If gastric juice secretion is incomplete or the amount of food is excessive, it cannot be completely digested. This material in the stomach is gradually transported into the intestines, and the third stage of digestion begins, which is digestion in the intestines. Digestion in the intestines is no different from digestion in the mouth and stomach, and is also divided into physical and chemical types. The inner lining of the intestine is also very rough and wrinkled, so that the rice in the food can be finely ground, and the stretching and contracting action of the intestinal wall muscles can be used to grind the food entering the intestine into fine particles as much as possible, which is a physical action. If the peristalsis of the intestinal wall is not healthy, the digestion of food will naturally be poor. Only the final chemical action can be relied upon, that is, the inner lining of the intestine not only secretes its own inherent liquid, but also, when food enters the intestine from the stomach, in the duodenum, it also receives the pancreatic juice from the pancreas and the bile from the liver, collectively called intestinal juice, which mainly digests fats and can also digest starch that was not completely digested in the mouth and protein that was not completely digested in the stomach. Therefore, unhealthy intestines and poor function of the pancreas and liver will result in poor digestion.</p>
<p>Food that has undergone the above three stages of digestion, if completely digested, is transferred from the lymphatic vessels of the intestinal lining to the veins, summarized into the inferior vena cava, and flows back to the right atrium, then to the right ventricle, then to the lungs, then to the left atrium, and then to the left ventricle. Food that is not completely digested remains in the intestines and becomes feces, which is excreted from the body. As for the original substance that has entered the left ventricle, it is distributed through the aorta to the five internal organs, six bowels, four limbs, and hundreds of parts of the body. During this blood circulation, if there is any obstruction or insufficient digestive power in the blood supply, it cannot be supplied to the whole body. The digested food that is supplied to the five internal organs, six bowels, four limbs, and hundreds of parts of the body relies on their inherent functions to provide nutrition to the whole body. If the function of each organ itself is incomplete, the non-functional organs will inevitably wither and die. Moreover, each stage of digestion requires considerable labor and time, so those who cannot handle the labor cannot digest, and those who have a short time cannot digest.</p>
<p>From this perspective, it can be seen that food is not about the quantity, but about the completeness of digestive power. Eating too much without digestion only increases the burden on the mouth, stomach, and intestines, and the whole body ultimately cannot actually benefit from it. As the saying goes: eating less has more flavor, eating more has no flavor. Eating too much leads to fatigue from chewing, and the physical and chemical actions are often incomplete, and digestion is naturally poor. Let's take a practical example: children who like to eat delicacies and eat without restraint are often seen with yellowish faces and thin muscles. Why? The physical work is not completed, and the chemical digestion does not have enough time. So, what is the way to remedy this? It is best to nourish the digestive power, not to overwork, and to strive for effort at the appropriate time, that is, to strictly practice vegetarianism between not eating and not eating too much, which is not only harmless, but also beneficial. Otherwise, indiscriminate eating and excessive gluttony will inevitably lead to exhaustion and ultimately the danger of complete destruction of digestive function. People in the world are confused about this principle and often force patients to eat, which is like driving a sick horse to travel day and night, isn't it dangerous?</p>
<p>Digestion is related to nutrition, and the amount of food is related to digestion. Analyzing it from a theoretical perspective, from digestive ability to vegetarianism, at a time when all things are expensive and resources are scarce, and it is extremely difficult to buy rice, flour, and all kinds of food, I deeply know that advocating vegetarianism is not harmful to physical health, but beneficial to economic and material savings. It can truly be said to solve the problem of eating.</p>

<h3>Shipbuilding Record</h3>
<p>Each cap nail requires three or more people to install, and it also requires drilling holes to enlarge them and make them neatly arranged. However, the forging and welding technique eliminates all the tedious work. Moreover, the forging and welding technique has other advantages; it can reduce the weight of the ship's hull—reducing an average of 13% to 15%. This not only reduces construction costs, but also increases the ship's load capacity throughout its life. Sometimes, forging and welding can greatly shorten construction time, especially for oil tankers. The side panels of oil tankers are more regular than those of cargo ships or passenger ships, so the panels can be matched in advance and forged and welded together on the shore, and then lifted in pieces to the sides of the ship with a crane. A large shipyard has invented a highly effective forging and welding machine that can forge and weld a foot of one-inch panel per minute. This machine is now used in many shipyards. An oil tanker of 19,000 tons, which used to take six or seven months on the slipway, can now be launched in four months with this machine. The structural strength of using forging and welding is also stronger than using cap nails, because cap nails cannot fit to 100%. The actual efficiency of cap nails is sometimes below 85%, while forging and welding, due to complete melting, leaves no gaps between the panels.</p>
<p>Forging and welding also encourages "preliminary matching"—for example, the bulkheads of the ship are more convenient to work on the ground. Doing preliminary matching on land rather than on the ship is another important reform in the shipbuilding industry in the past twenty years. Because it is laid flat on the ground, more manpower can be used than when it is hanging on the ship, so it is done on the ground as much as possible. Moreover, "downward" forging and welding on the ground is much easier than holding the welding rod over your head and forging and welding "upward." The entire bow, the bulkheads that divide the hull into compartments, and other parts are now made and matched on the ground first, and then lifted to the slipway for final assembly. Sometimes, even for ships whose keel has not yet been installed, 50% has already been assembled in advance.</p>
<p>The latest cargo ships or passenger ships, on the surface, seem no different from those of ten or fifteen years ago. The huge progress is in the interior, not in the exterior. There have been extraordinary improvements in terms of work rate and efficiency. The position of the reciprocating steam engine has been almost entirely replaced by the turbine, saving no less than 50% of fuel. The speed has also increased. Oil tankers are a clear example. Their speed has increased by 40% to 50% in the past five years. When the speed of other oil tankers is only 10 to 11 knots, there are already national defense oil tankers manufactured with a speed of 19 knots. If the driver can drive at the highest speed, they can make money from it. To date, the speed of new commercial oil tankers has also increased to 15 knots.</p>
<p>The average speed of ships built during World War I was about 11 knots, while the average speed of recently planned ships is above 15.5 knots. As a result, the transportation work that used to require four ships now only requires three. Improved cargo handling linkages have also reduced the time for loading and unloading goods, allowing two new ships to be equivalent to three old ships. Many voyages have twice the efficiency of older ships. The sailing speed is certainly improved, and fuel and repairs are also more economical, and the time for shipping goods is also more economical.</p>
<p>The shape of the ships has also changed, making it easier to propel in the water, requiring less horsepower per ton of net weight, and the weight of the machinery per horsepower has also been reduced, so the machinery can be accommodated in a smaller space, and the space for carrying passengers is increased. The application of air conditioning has become more widespread than before, the efficiency of life-saving equipment has been improved, and the health of crew and passengers has also improved. Electrical equipment has been widely used, and in new ships, almost everything except the main engine is controlled by electricity. Fireproof materials have also been used more widely, so fire insurance is reduced and the safety of passengers and crew is greatly increased.</p>
<p>Nelson said that the effectiveness of people and materials is like the ratio of three to one. Good sailors and capable crew make up a ship. In recent years, the biggest obstacle to the American shipping industry has been the lack of sailor training. Vigorous exercise has gained a foothold on ships. If this is said to be caused by "the bad conditions on the popular ships," then it should no longer exist. Crew quarters have been thoroughly renovated, costing more than $1.5 million. The crew quarters on newly commissioned ships are second to none in the history of any maritime country—some old sailors say that this comfortable quarters makes people feel like they are floating in the sky. New ships have game rooms and large crew quarters, and it is rare for two or three crew members to live in the same room. The salary is very high, and sailors can earn an average of more than $90 in addition to most living expenses. The generosity can be seen in general. (End)</p>

<h3>Bank Absorption: Black Market Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash black market rose from fatigue to firmness, probably because a certain bank had a large appetite for it. People's hearts in all directions were quite stable, and the transactions became even scarcer. From the morning, each bar (ten taels) was slightly fatigued at first, falling to 100 yuan, to 18,400 yuan. Although the silver shop group was still seen spitting it out, the absorption by a certain bank and wealthy people stopped the decline and began to rise, between 18,500 and 18,600 yuan. The final transaction price at 11:35 was 18,650 yuan, which has risen by 150 yuan compared to the previous day's price.</p>
<p>The exchange price of gold jewelry per tael in silver shops is still listed at 1,950 yuan in Daxin peers (200 yuan less for intake). Silver is still listed at 18 yuan. Although there were no transactions in the black market, the price has risen to 13.5 yuan. Silver coins have not been traded, and the price is 7 yuan and 78 cents, it is said.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Steps Up, Actually Seen at 36 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for exchange drafts and bills has reached 30 yuan per thousand yuan, an increase of 10 yuan. The money industry association's interbank lending rate is still listed at 7%, it is said. Actually seen at 36 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market, French, US, British, and gold all rose by 10 yuan. The former was 430 yuan, and the latter was 440 yuan. US dollar bills continued to rise to 36 yuan. Hong Kong bills were still 3 yuan and 6 cents, a deduction of one cent for large bills. Military tickets opened at 7 yuan and 6 cents in the morning, then retreated to 7 yuan and 4 cents, and finally 7 yuan and 4 and a half cents, a small six cents compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>More Out Than In: The Bond Market is Vague</h3>
<p>The bond market was still spent in a floating and vague state yesterday. Dakangcheng continued to sell off, and Hefeng, Jiufeng, Shuntai, Maoda, Gongmao, etc. also joined in. The selling atmosphere became more and more intense. Most of the buyers in the market were covering short positions, and there were very few investments taken in. It was faintly heard that a certain financial community had transferred a huge amount and was now entrusting people to sell it. All those near the water have participated in it. If all of these spot goods flow out, then Class C will break 60 yuan without any effort. In addition, the money market is extremely tight at the moment, and today's allocation is like yesterday's exchange allocation. Clues can be found in the traces. Yesterday was originally the 13th lottery period for Class C, but there was no news. The winning numbers of Class A and B, which have been overdue for two months, have not been consulted so far. Using the past to prove the present, the future can be imagined. Yesterday, Class C opened first. Lianyi took the lead and sold first, opening at 60 yuan, which caused Hongxing to cover a large short position. Yitai, Tongkang, Houde, and Dazhong also covered positions, but because the selling atmosphere in the market was too heavy, new buyers shrank back. There is still a lot of movement in the future, so you have to prepare in advance. As a result, except for Class A and B, which were slightly better by one cent and four cents, Class C had no honor or disgrace, and Class D and E were slightly down by seven cents to one yuan and one cent. Transactions amounted to approximately 1.1 million to 1.2 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to the Previous Day Total A 67.87 67.80 Up 0.07 Total B 62.80 62.20 Up 0.10 Total C 61.50 60.00 61.10 Flat Total D 56.70 56.00 56.10 Down 1.10 Total E 59.10 58.80 59.10 Up 0.10</p>

<h3>Spot Goods Exhausted; Double Horse Yarn is in Short Supply; A Fall is a Rise</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is still strong, which is due to the increasingly tight roots. The initial opening price of 20s Double Horse Yarn rose to 3,860 yuan, but profit-takers gradually spit it out, and it loosened to 3,775 yuan. There was a slight hover at the low price. Later, it was heard that the spot yarn situation was good, and the selling price was quite high, which made people excited. The market turned upwards and rose to 3,880 yuan. The closing price was 3,830 yuan. 42s Blue Phoenix was 9,850 yuan to 9,750 yuan. The closing price was 9,920 yuan.

<h3>Continuous Rise Too High; Eastern Cloth Profit-Takers Sell; Coarse Cloth Spot Goods Still Expensive</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: The market trend continues to be strong. Yesterday, 16-pound Double Elephant coarse cloth spot goods sold for 240 yuan, and Earth for 220 yuan, which is another increase of 5 yuan. 12-pound Dapeng fine cloth was 190 yuan. The morning price of the warehouse receipt was 140 yuan. The transaction price of Earth fine cloth rose to 192 yuan, and Fugui was 186 yuan. Xiaoji Lin cloth opened at 188 yuan in the morning, and the market shouted 190 yuan later, but there were no sellers. Blue Magnolia bleached cloth was 189 yuan. Three Sheep Fu silk was 6 yuan and 5 and a half cents. Changshou was around 6 yuan and 4 and a half cents.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Yesterday's market hovered and slightly decreased, probably because the continuous rise was too high, and profit-takers came out. Longtou fine cloth started at 239 yuan for new orders, and closed at 37 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, it once rose to 39 yuan, but then fell back to 37 yuan and 2 and a half cents at closing.

<h3>Rayon Price Sees a Peak of 10,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rayon market, the rising wind intensified. 250 Wanshougong Bright opened at 10,000 yuan, probably because there was a lack of spot chips and the source was not smooth. The buying enthusiasm of the industry was strong, and the prices of all goods rose accordingly, causing the market to soar more and more. The morning opening price of 75 Golden Rooster Semi-gloss Small Box was 8,750 yuan, a sharp increase of 750 yuan compared to the previous day. Afterwards, the industry followed up to purchase, 8,780 yuan, 8,850 yuan, and the price soared all the way up, closing at a record high price of 8,950 yuan. The price of 75 Black Bird Semi-gloss Large Box was 8,000 yuan, gradually rising to 8,250 yuan.

The prices of other grades of silk have also risen by 600 to 700 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3>Match, Candle, and Soap: The Falling Trend Turns Fierce</h3>
<p>The daily necessities market, the recent falling trend is very strong. Although the factory has not yet announced any supply news, it is actually because sales are low, and it is difficult to expect a recovery.囤户 are also hesitant to enter, and the market atmosphere is soft and difficult to be firm. The market opened yesterday with Phoenix brand matches falling to 5,400 yuan per box, a sharp drop of 500 yuan compared to the previous day. Ji Gu Ben Soap was 330 yuan per box, Bai Xiang Mao Soap was 295 yuan, and Huang Xiang Mao Soap was 280 yuan, also a small drop of 5 yuan to 10 yuan. The transaction of foreign candles was unattended, and it was bound to soften. Ji Bai Lishi brand was 180 yuan per box, and it was still difficult to sell,</p>
<h3>Cigarette Sales are Dull</h3>
<p>Cigarette sales are as dull as wood. The factories in this port are selling all kinds of goods at a flat price, and the supply is relatively smooth. The rural wholesale offices are calm, and floating and scattered 囤户 continue to throw out their goods, so the market atmosphere is becoming more and more depressed. The opening price of Daying brand was 10,500 yuan per box of 50,000 sticks, Lao Dao brand was 9,600 yuan, Pinhai brand was 6,700 yuan, Wuhua brand was 5,900 yuan, Xiaoxiannv brand was 5,900 yuan, 10 sticks of Daqianmen brand was 3,000 yuan per box, Ri Yan Jinqiang spleen was 2,800 yuan, Jin Dalou spleen was 2,900 yuan, Hong Meigui brand was 2,100 yuan, Quanlu brand was 3,000 yuan, Zhizhen brand was 2,200 yuan, and Guo Yan Bai Jinlong brand was 3,750 yuan. Looking at the market trend of all kinds of goods, it is soft and weak, so the price may continue to fall.</p>
<h3>National Rice Black Market Becomes More Wild</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday's all-night thunderstorms made the suburbs completely cut off. There was no news of the price of national rice. Yesterday the weather turned clear. It was heard that the early and late rice was 410 yuan in the French Concession and 425 yuan in the British Concession. This is a black market, and it is not official. However, because buying rice is difficult, it creates opportunities for these unscrupulous merchants. It is better to buy and sell openly, which can maintain the people's food, gain goodwill, and stabilize prices. 洋米 is sold at a flat price, so people flock to it like ducks. They often wait at the entrance of the rice store at 11 or 12 o'clock at night, compiling numbers and issuing chips at midnight, and sitting until 8 o'clock the next day to distribute the grain. They must sleep in the open for one night before they have hope of getting rice. Those who go on the same day will not necessarily be unable to get rice, but because the crowd is too crowded, it is not easy to squeeze in. Fortunately, outside the concession, national rice is still sold for 389 yuan, and each household can buy five liters of 洋米 for 10 yuan, and the people are all grateful.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains are Still Lackluster</h3>
<p>Yesterday, miscellaneous grains were still traded sporadically. People's hearts were depressed, and the market showed a lack of strength. It is recorded that 60 packages of Chongming沙赤 were priced at 203 yuan to 199 yuan, 20 packages of Jiangbei莞豆 were priced at 205 yuan, 50 packages of Wujiang拣青 were priced at 200 yuan, 50 packages of Pinghu社豆 were priced at 213 yuan, 1,000 pieces of Shengji bean cake for the new warehouse receipt in April were priced at 53 yuan and 2 cents to 53 yuan and 5 cents, and 500 pieces of Lizi bean cake for the new warehouse receipt in March were priced at 51 yuan and 5 cents.</p>
<h3>Diminishing Food Reserves</h3>
<p>The supply of sugar is already scarce, and the reserves are dwindling day by day. It has been found that the total amount of sugar needed by retailers this month is 71,000 bags, but only 30,000 bags were supplied. It is clear that demand exceeds supply. However, due to the need for movement permits after the "April 12th Incident," the black market is not very active. A recent survey found that there are over 360,000 bags of sugar in total. If the supply is maintained at 30,000 bags per month, it can be maintained for at most a little over a year.</p>
<h3>Bitter Almonds Increase by Another Hundred Yuan</h3>
<p>Bitter almonds are becoming increasingly scarce due to limited arrivals and inventory. Market prices are constantly rising. Since the end of last month, in just over ten days, the increase has reached over one hundred yuan, and the tight supply shows no sign of easing, mainly due to active recent sales.</p>

<h3>The Four Sisters in "Four Sisters"</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>—— Shen Hao —— Chen Qi —— Zhang Fan —— Sally</p>
<p>"Four Sisters" is a lyrical tragicomedy. The playwright skillfully uses his intelligent pen to develop the personalities and actions of the four sisters. Due to the differences in their personalities, many intricate plots are interwoven. "Four Sisters" is like a clear Zhuyeqing wine, natural and complete. Watching it will make you intoxicated and happy, as if your entire mind has been cleansed.</p>
<p>In the current theater scene, finding four sisters is difficult, because any mistake will affect the entire play. This time, their lineup is Shen Hao as the eldest sister, Chen Qi as the second sister, Zhang Fan as the third sister, and Sally as the fourth sister. It is truly a perfect match, a magnificent sight, because they are all famous actors.</p>
<p>Shen Hao hasn't acted for a long time. When the Dramatic Arts Society was at the Xuan Palace, she played Sai Jinhua. Later, she also participated in "Sea Hero." This time, she is dedicating herself to the stage again with the determination to succeed. At the same time, her personality is very similar to that of the eldest sister, and her performance will certainly not be weaker than anyone else's.</p>
<p>Our second sister is a person who only values modernity. She is played by Xiao Dongxi, Chen Qi. Xiao Dongxi is no longer small. She has made great progress in her acting skills since her role in "Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty." Seeing her achievements in film, I believe she will achieve special success this time.</p>
<p>And Zhang Fan must be the most familiar to readers. She tried her voice for the first time in "The Strange Man in the Attic" and has already won many people's praise. This time, she plays the third sister, a tomboyish girl, just like her own little temper!</p>
<p>As for Sally, she has performed in "Yang Guifei" and "The Hunchback of Notre Dame," and her results are not weaker than those who enjoy fame. Such four sisters, not only meet our ideals, but also have the cooperation of Lu Shan, Qiao Qi, Ye Xiaomei, and Qiu Quan. The success of this time can be predicted.</p>
<p>The play "Four Sisters" tells the story of family changes, and is similar in style to "Thunderstorm," but the subject matter is completely different. Some of its elements are taken from "Little Women" and "Four Daughters," but the entire plot progresses through sorrow, excitement, and humor, making me feel very memorable and particularly tortuous!</p>
<h3>Bette Davis's Self-Account of a Coincidence</h3>
<p>— Gan Dan</p>
<p>About ten years ago, my mother took the train from Boston to New York. When a woman carrying a dog came on board, the seats were already full. Because she had a dog, no one wanted to sit next to her. They squeezed their packages on the seats to block her.</p>
<p>My mother loved dogs very much, so she moved over a bit to give the woman a seat. Soon they started talking.</p>
<p>My mother proudly told her new friend that her daughter was already playing a small role on Broadway, and that she was "a great artist." You can imagine how eager a mother is!</p>
<p>The woman told my mother that she had been a journalist for twelve years and that she would like to write a true-to-life play or book in the future.</p>
<p>When they arrived in New York, neither my mother nor the woman introduced themselves, but they both talked about their dreams and aspirations - the woman talked about herself, and my mother talked about me.</p>
<p>Not long after, my mother and I went to Hollywood. At first, I tried hard to get a position, but I didn't succeed. One day, George Arliss gave me a role in "The Man Who Played God," and from then on, I got a job.</p>
<p>One day, when I was starring in "The Lady from Shanghai," my mother came to the studio to see me. At that time, I wanted her to meet the author of "The Lady from Shanghai," Li Cuifei, but just as I was about to introduce them, she walked past the set to meet this old friend.</p>
<p>"I have often thought of you since the day we met on the train," I heard my mother say. "What are you doing in Hollywood?"</p>
<p>"Don't you know? I wrote a book, and they bought it to make a movie. I'm here to visit the set. So, what about you? Tell me how your daughter is doing."</p>
<p>"She's right here! Let me introduce you - Bette Davis, but I still don't know your name!"</p>
<p>"My name is Li Cuifei."</p>
<p>Strangely enough, an ordinary encounter often leads to excitement in life when they meet again!</p>
<h3>The Quirks of Hollywood Stars</h3>
<p>Gary Cooper employs a chauffeur, but the chauffeur's job is very simple, simply washing Gary's cars.</p>
<p>Janet Gaynor owns an expensive car, but she never drives it herself. (Hollywood male and female stars like to drive themselves to show off.)</p>
<p>Bing Crosby has his own library, but he rarely has time to read a book.</p>
<p>Marlene Dietrich bought an expensive camera, but she never uses it to take a single picture.</p>
<p>Napoleon has a chauffeur, but he always drives his own car.</p>
<p>Fred MacMurray is a talented saxophone player, but the instrument he owns has never left its case.</p>
<p>Mike Penney, who is praised by the public as "America's First Master of Humor," tells jokes on screen or on the radio, but he never tells a joke in private.</p>
<p>Cary Grant buys more than a dozen hats every year, but he is rarely seen wearing a hat.</p>
<p>WC Fields bought an expensive radio, but the chance to listen to it is very slim.</p>
<p>— Wei La</p>
<p>Shirley Ross insists that her favorite color is green, but she usually uses blue or brown things.</p>
<p>John Bowers puts his two cars in the garage at home, but he rides his bicycle ten miles every day.</p>
<h3>Silver Screen News</h3>
<p>— Bo Fen</p>
<p>Recently, news sources from Hollywood are scarce. The plane crash of Carole Lombard, Lewis Milestone's anti-war stance, Carole finally getting married, and Errol Flynn getting divorced are all sensational events in the United States. Therefore, I will record some simple news to inform readers:</p>
<p>Large producer Lasky and Warner Bros. collaborated to complete "Sergeant York." They decided to continue their efforts and film "The Adventures of Mark Twain," which was filmed in response to a proposal by Dr. Gallup, president of the public opinion survey association.</p>
<p>The Warner Bros. film "Black Widow," which was a sensation for a time, is set in French Guiana, with a deeply touching and stimulating plot, starring Bette Davis, and is already in production. Another female lead is Broadway star Eve Symington, who also plays an important role in the film "Male Animals."</p>
<p>Ann Sheridan has received rave reviews since co-starring in the tragic literary film "Kings Row" with Robert Cummings and Ronald Reagan. In the future, she will mostly film sad films.</p>
<h3>Wang Shaoqing and Li Shifang Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>— Ruo</p>
<p>Special report: Erhu master Wang Shaoqing and "Little Mei Lanfang" Li Shifang, teacher and disciple, arrived safely in Shanghai yesterday (the 10th). They are currently staying at a certain residence on Massenet Road, resting for several days. On the 18th of this month (i.e., Saturday), they will definitely perform at the Grand Theater. The three days of performances are "Lian Jin Feng," "Sheng Si Hen," and "Feng Huan Chao," all masterpieces of the Mei School. There is also a question worth studying, that is, who will play the erhu for Li's performances this time? This is something that fans of opera and erhu are eager to know. It is said that Wang Shaoqing had agreed with his high-achieving student (whose name will be kept secret for now) in the old capital to come south together. He is currently working on saying melodies and matching tunes, and is very busy.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Zheng Guoyi wrote the biography, part of the Kunling, Zhang Yizhang produced the illustrations</p>
<p>(14) Wang Xichun</p>
<p>Two people emerged from the singing girls of the Qinhuai River: one was Wang Yurong, and the other was Wang Xichun. When Wang Xichun first arrived in Shanghai, some people used this as a mockery, which was really boring enough to make people laugh. How can it be seen that a singing girl cannot go to sea to sing opera? This does not harm Wang Xichun herself, so no one mentioned it again later. Xichun's appearance is very beautiful, and her demeanor on stage is also good, which is very similar to the shadow of Jin Suqin. Although her "voice," "appearance," "singing," and "acting" are all inferior to Jin Suqin, among the many Kunling Dan roles in Jiangnan, she is the only one who can be regarded as the second to Jin Suqin. She can be considered a good opera material. In addition to singing opera, she is also busy filming movies, and has starred in many films. She is like a star, and I am afraid that if this continues, she will not have the time and opportunity to learn opera. Using the ancient saying "rowing upstream; if you don't advance, you will retreat" as a metaphor, it will inevitably hinder her upward progress in Peking opera.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Boat in Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jiawen</p>
<p>(3) Guest Arrives</p>
<p>"I gritted my teeth, didn't say anything, and thought to myself: You things, sometimes speak human language, sometimes speak ghost language, and now you speak official language again. Wu Song, the tiger-fighting captain of Jingyang Ridge in the past, hated you things. And just in front of me is a bridge. Walking on the bridge, if my shoulder bumps into one, one will fall into the river: lift my left foot, and another one falls: lift my right foot, and another one falls; use my left hand, and another one: use my right hand, but I stretch out into the air, because there are only four of them, and my hand is in vain."</p>
<p>Huang Longzhen spoke vividly. When he talked about dealing with the police, he stood up and performed, stretching his hands and feet, as if he were practicing martial arts. Wei Cheng, who had closed his eyes to listen to Huang Long's words, couldn't help but open his eyes and asked, "What happened later?" After asking this, he closed his eyelids again. Huang Long put the wine glass on his face and smiled, "Later I ran away. But Brother Wei Cheng, it is said that you can't run away, and it still cost me a lot of money to be safe and sound. And another time..." Huang Long sat back in his chair, and seeing Wei Cheng's hazy eyes, he changed his tone and said, "Okay, you sleep for a while. You won't be able to sleep if you change places. You sleep your sleep, I drink my wine." He picked up a glass wine bottle, tested its weight in his hand; then put it under the light, closing one eye and opening the other, to see how much was left; he couldn't see it very well, so he shook it a bit, heard the sound, cracked a smile; poured the wine into the glass, and smiled again at the rising wine flowers.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to bring his mouth up to drink, he suddenly heard a sharp sound from the wooden partition. The sound was like someone hitting it hard with a whip. Although Huang Long had never been afraid of ghosts and monsters, he was a little surprised, looked at the door and asked, "Who is it? Magpie? I'm drinking, not drinking yours, drinking Brother Wei Cheng's, drinking my aunt's, it has nothing to do with you. You watch me drink, I drink, and if you do it again, I will admire you." He raised his wine glass again and put it on his face. Wei Cheng sat up from the rattan chair and said, "Who are you talking to? I was sleeping muddle-headed, and I seemed to hear a sound." Huang Long put the wine glass heavily on the table, the wine was still in his throat, and replied, "Yes, a sound." Wei Cheng said, "The house is old, it often makes such a sound. It won't happen when it rains, but it will when it's sunny. If my aunt hears it, she will say that my mother is showing herself. Ah, mother, I haven't had a mother since yesterday: you too: my classmate, the one surnamed Chen, too. (47)</p>
