<p>社評</p>
<h3>大東亞戰爭週年紀念</h3>
<p>大東亞戰爭發動以來，整整的一年了。在這一年內，東亞大局，已有空前的轉變；世界的形勢，也受了很大的影饗。百餘年來英美在東亞的勢力，已經開始全面的崩潰；亞洲民族起而自決的日子，已經來臨了！</p>
<p>我們中華民族，立國在亞洲，文化嬗遞，五千多年，史跡之震爍中外的，代不絕書。目前我們父站在一個空前的時代，怎樣擔負起我中華民族之一部份的使命呢？這是我們所必須隨時反省和自勵的。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭，不只是日本一國的戰爭，而戰爭影饗所及，不限於日本一國，這是很明白的，所以我們東亞各國人民，都不能處身於戰爭之外，這是尤其明顯。那麼，我們在這戰爭時期，對於中日兩國的關係及其前途，對於這個戰爭的發展前途，又那裏可以沒有正確的認識呢？又那裏可以放棄自己的責任呢？</p>
<p>以上是我們在這大東亞戰爭年紀念日敢於勉勵我們同胞的！</p>
<p>但是，我們還得進一步來看，一年來大東亞戰爭進展的神速，戰果的擴大，實在是世界歷史上所少見的！不過，爲了澈底完成大東亞戰爭之使命，建樹東亞及世界新秩序，尚待中日及其他各民族的努力奮鬥，這實在是今天不可麼減的眞理，更是我們所應該時時警惕的。</p>
<p>回溯大東亞戰爭爆發以前，中日兩國，都爲着各自的國策而奮鬥，大東亞戰爭發動以後，中日關係不得不有根本的改變，兩國間互相依存，同甘共苦的必要，已經到了沒有猶豫考慮餘地的時期了！日本需要中國協力的程度突增，毫無疑問，反之，以中國目前的處境而言，其戰刧之慘重，民生的困苦，實爲我國歴史上所少見，亦爲日本朝野所共知，所以中國需要於日本之協力的，不亞於日本對我國的需要。</p>
<p>可是，回顧一年來的事實，彼此協力的程度，已吾達到理想的境域，乃是中日雙方當局與人民在今日所應深自反省的。試就我國方面來看，其協力的程度，自然還不能認爲滿意，尤其楚缺乏自勸性之協力一點，不能不引爲遺憾。我們檢討的結果，覺得有乘這偉大的紀念日獻言於友邦朝野之必要的，就是爲什麽中國人民缺乏自動性的協力，似乎過去日本朝野尚未充分重視我國人民的力量吧。語云：「民爲邦本」，「政在得民」，只有充分獲得人民力量的支持，一切政策才能順利的推行，而對日的協力，才能收獲理想的效果。而所謂重視人民力量，首先在於民衆力量的培養，允當以保障人民最低限度之生活爲第一步，只有人民生活得到保障，人民的力量培植起來了，才能自動和積極的加强中日協力，完成大東亞戰爭的偉大使命。</p>
<p>同時，我們更願向我國朝野獻言的，就是我們不應該妄自菲薄，放棄自己的力量。我們要認淸自己在大東亞戰爭中，是具有着決定的力量的！如果我們和日本協力達到適合的程度，就可以提前完成戰爭的使命，反之，那麼不僅中日兩國，就是全東亞都要遭釗不堪設想的結局，那麽，我們應該怎樣積極發揮全國人民的力量以與日本協力呢？第一是改善全國政治，集中人民的力量，第二是喚醒重慶依賴英美的迷夢，爲東亞民族總解放而共同與友邦協力，澈底肅淸英美的勢力。</p>
<p>『得民者昌』，這是我國歷史上大政治家治國的方針，「萬民翼贊一，這是日本在這次大東亞戰爭甲在國內實現的政綱；中日兩國無分古今，都極重視人民的力量，具有決定的作用，所以我們又乘此大東亞戰爭周年紀念日，鄭重地提出了上面的幾點。</p>
<p>最後我們更乘此向大東亞戰爭中英勇犧牲的將士致摯誠的哀悼，向中日兩國和各民挨預祝共同努力，爭取最後的勝利—東亞民族解放！</p>

<h3>再告全國國民</h3>
<p>— 汪兆銘</p>
<p>—怎樣同甘苦—</p>
<p>去年今日、友邦日本發動大東亞戰爭、國已政府立即發表聲明、決與友邦日本同甘共苦、自是以來、日本的海陸空軍、戰必勝、攻必取、百年以來、英美加於東亞的侵略勢力、一掃而空、東太平洋及南洋無復英美飛揚跋扈之餘地、其殖民地東自菲律濱、西至緬甸、南包括馬來羣島及荷屬爪哇羣島、次第喪失俱盡、從一方面看來、是英美侵略勢力的沒落、從另一方面看來、是東亞共榮的開始、僅僅一年的時間、而友邦日本成就之大、一至於此、這是深可慶賀的、而慶賀被炸際、念及友邦前綫將士及銃後國民、鞠躬盡瘁、畫夜不懈、以艱苦卓絕之精神、成此空前偉大之巨業、誠不勝其欽佩、我於大東亞戰爭週年紀念之際、首先對於友邦政府及前綫將士全體人民、深致馨祝與敬仰、</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭的勝利、即是東亞共榮基礎的奠定、要使東亞共榮完全實現、則不可不繼續努力於大東亞戰爭的完遂、我對友邦致敬之後、我不得不向中國國民有所披瀝、</p>
<p>我們決心與友邦日本同甘共苦、可是怎樣同甘共苦呢、我先把同甘共苦的意義申述一下、</p>
<p>同甘共苦的的意義、我曾經用農作來說明、當耕耘的時候、大家在田間流汗耕作、辛苦備嘗、這是共苦、當收穫的時候、大家一同在田舍裏、嘗新榖得安飽、這是同甘、由此可知必先有共苦而後有同甘、共苦是現在的忠實的努力、同甘是將來的確實希望、</p>
<p>野蠻民族不知道有同甘共苦的、他只知道自取其甘、而與人以苦、由此生出仇恨嫉妬、以及殘殺的行爲、文明民族便不然、從消極方面說、是己所不欲勿施於人」從積極方面說是「己欲立而立人、己欲達而遠人」、這便是人與人的同甘共苦、從道德說是、「善與人同」、從生活狀態說是與人同樂、孔子說得好、「人不獨親其親、不獨子其子」孟子說得好、「樂人之樂者、人亦樂其樂、憂人之憂者、人亦憂其憂」、東方道義的精髓、莫過於仁恕、這是人與人的道德信條、也即是人與人的同甘共苦、</p>
<p>由人與人的關係、推而至於國與國的關係、在功利主義的國家、和野蠻民族一樣、是不知道有同甘共苦的、例如帝國主義之於殖民地、但知榨取其勞力與原料、以供自己的享受、在其平時、則自處於至甘、而置人於至苦、其在戰時、則强人以供苦、而決不許人以同甘、即使許了也是白說、上次大戰、英國之於印度、就是最顯明的例子、因是之故、印度人民雖欲不離心離德而不能了、</p>
<p>以上所攀、是只知與人共苦、而不知與人同甘之例了、但日也有些國家、只知與人同甘而不與人共苦的、例如上次大戰有些國家、並未嘗竭其能力、協助戰爭、而於大戰之後、却因橡機會、分霑利益、這些利益、不是以勞力得來的、至少也是以輕微的勞力、穫取重大的利益、這樣的利益、是不能永保的、甚至因之賈禍、這些例子，不勝枚舉總而言之、只知共苦、不知同甘、是專欲、是殘忍、只知同甘、不知共苦、是僥倖、是取巧、前者是强國易犯的罪惡、後者是弱國易犯的罪惡、尋其根源、都是由於功利主義、我們東方國家要以道義精神、來替代西方的功利主義、</p>
<p>人與人的道德是仁恕、國與國的道德也是仁恕、本着仁恕、以實行國與國的同甘共苦、所謂共苦、不以是消極的分擔痛苦而且是積極的一同在痛苦中　扎、不只是以至大之勇氣、忍受痛苦、而且是以最大之努力、解除痛苦、所謂同廿、不只是以分甘爲目的、而是一同以最大之努力、不斷的製造出甘來、以一同享受、這是國民政府聲明同甘共苦的最大意義、</p>
<p>如今進一步說明怎樣的同甘共苦了、先就心理方面來說、以前抗戰的心理、是「抗戰亦亡、不抗戰亦亡、與其不抗戰而亡、不如抗戰而亡、」這種主張、是從悲觀出發的、除此之外、還夾雜着英美援助共產黨合作的希冀、這便是迷惑的心理了、和平運動、首先對於此種心理、加以改造、和平可以救國、用不着悲觀至於倚賴英美援助共匪合作、更是飲酖止渴、這是針鋒相對的心理改造、及至大東亞戰爭發動、和平運動的心理、却更進一步了、整個東亞已臨於生死存亡關頭、凡是位於東亞的國家及民族、不爲東亞同志、便爲東亞叛逆、國父所垂示的大亞洲主義、已不復是理想、而是當前的現實、中國人除非不想救國、如其想救國除了保衛東亞、決沒有第二條路、保衛東亞、即所以救國，救國與保衛東亞是一件事、不是兩件事、以前不過是說和平可救國用不着繼續抗戰、如今是若要救國只有與日本同心協力、保衛東亞、而所謂繼續抵抗、不過爲英美利用、助共匪吶喊、在保衛東亞的覜點上、是叛逆行爲、在救國的觀點上、是蟊賊行爲、這種心理改造、較之和平運動的當初的確是更進一步、而又的確是國民革命的原始目的、中國人的本來面目、</p>
<p>建設東亞新秩序之意義、一方在掃除英美帝國主義、一方在掃除共產主義、重新奠定以道義爲基礎之局面、新國民運動、基於此意義、更爲具體的規定、由狹義的國家主義、到國家集團主義、由個人主義、到全體主義、由私人資本主義、到國家資本主義、這是在政始上經濟上文化上把精神面目、予以澈底改造、爲完成這偉大的使命、需要國內人士之合力、同時需要中日兩國人士思想之交流、由思想之交流、而馴致於行動之一致、就相當戮力排除萬難而言、是共苦、就相與提携同走上光明大道而言、是同甘、這是從心理方面指出同甘共苦之意義再就環竟方面來說、在大東亞戰爭中、日本是立在前綫、中國是位在後方、中國連年彫敝之餘、說到協力、實在惶恐、然而後方的責任、也不容忽視、確立治安、改善民生、是國民政府遝都以來的最大方針、也就是大東亞戰爭中位於後方的中國最大之任務、就確立治安來說、在消極方面、是肅淸共匪、使不復能騷擾地方、在積極方面還是本於心理改造、使一般民衆明瞭大義、各就本位、努力工作、所有目前消鄕工作、以至一切治安工作、友邦將士在白忙中、予我們以種種援助、我們也不避一切的困難與危險、積極前進、這都是隨在表現出以共苦求同甘的意義、就改善民生來說、目前最大的痛苦、是物資缺乏、物價飛騰、我們必須在這些痛苦中、分析出那些是不能免的痛苦、那些是可以免除的痛苦、例如因全面和平尚未實現、而致生產减退、因大東亞戰爭尚未完遂、而致交通阻隔、這些痛苦是不能免的、我們只有本於共苦的意義、以極大的勇氣來承受、並且盡可能的增加生產、盡可能的恢復交通、盡可能的節的消費、我們認定這些痛苦、不但是不能免的現象、而且正是我們所應該承受的重任、以緊張的情緒、來克服惡劣的環境、至於經濟機構之未完備、社會組織之未健全、以至人事方面、技術方面、種種缺點、未能改善、這些是可以免除的痛苦、我們也只有本於共苦的意義、不存自私自利之心、不存因循苟且之念、不徇情而、不避阻撓、努力以求缺點之修正、這樣必能使各種痛苦、以次减輕而臻於解脫、總而言之、這些複雜問題、如果沒有一貫的精神、只有複雜之上、更加複雜、處處碰壁、處處掣肘、如果本於同甘共苦的心理、則相照應相扶助之不暇、必能使複雜變爲簡單、這是使環境方面、指出同甘共苦之意義、</p>
<p>如上所說、所謂同甘是指中日兩國將來的共存共榮、所謂共苦、是指中日兩國現在的同心協力、克服一切困難、全國同胞、必須知道、大光明在目前、信念堅定、志嚮不搖、同時又必須知道。　只有努力。才能接近光明、到達光明、全國同胞、快些上前、以勇猛精進刻苦耐勞之精神、完成復興中華、保衛東亞之使命、（中央社）</p>

<h3>重慶工業界之苦痛</h3>
<p>物資問題，爲目前重慶政權最嚴重之問題，尤在目前國際組織被遮斷時，更增加其嚴重性。關於加緊工業生產，以增益物　泉源，已爲內地迫切之要求，惟政府之措施，往往隔靴搔癢，名扶助而實摧殘，工業界所遭遇之環境，與當前之現實，直與「增加生產」之目標，背道而馳。其病態，約言之如下：</p>
<p>工業界之一般病態</p>
<p>（甲）企業無保障　工廠無確切保障，一般投資工業者，認爲一種戰時投機，穩健之輩不願放膽投資，而取巧者一意追　暴利，不惜抬高物價，實心經營者，於是時感環境不安之苦。</p>
<p>（乙）平價政策不平衡　平價政策之不平衝，使若干工業不得不以怠工維持其生存。平價機構往往惟以抑抵工業成品之價格爲事，而不能同時抑低原料之價格。以致工業家一面以高價購進原料，一面反以低價售出成品，不免於虧本。在此情况之下，工業家爲圖减少損失，祇有延長生產過程，或者减少產量，以待產品核定售價之增加。此現象最先見於麵粉工業。</p>
<p>（丙）動力與原料分配不均　動力與原料之分配，未能充分以民生需要爲凖據，力求其合理，因之有若干非民生所必需之工業，保有優越之勢力者，能得動力與原料之充分供給，可以儘量製造。而若干與民生直接有關係之工業，因缺乏背景，反有向隅之憾。更自海口全部被封鎖以後，若干仰給國外之工業原料，益感缺乏，亦爲當前工業上之危機。五金電料，自經軍政部微購後，民營工廠，困苦萬狀。雖云戰時軍事第一，但亦當盡調節盈虛之能事，稍使民營工業得到喘延機會。</p>
<p>（丁）資金之枯竭因物價暴漲，形成工業資金之普遍枯竭。在目前辦理工業，虧折者之原因，固在一度周轉之後，資金即一度减少：而盈餘者往往同樣於一度周轉之後，資金即感覺不敷。蓋所能獲得之利潤，尚不足抵物價之高漲。資金之缺乏，使許多工業未能充分發揮其生產力。</p>
<p>以上所舉工業界之困難，非政府有適當之措施，工業界自身則無法糾正。於是工業界同仁聯合遷川工廠聯合會，西南實業協會，及重慶市國貨廠商聯合會等團體，發出工業界之困難與期望之呼聲，於此種呼聲中，更可反映與證明政府措施之不當。</p>
<p>不合理之稅捐負擔</p>
<p>戰時稅捐，原以收縮通貨，穩定物價爲最大前提。故稅捐之課征，必爲通貨之所在，而課征足以刺激物價者，則須力求避免。兩年以來，農產價格之高漲，遠過於自製工業品及一般商品，故通貨之膨脹，已不在都市工商業，而在農村土地；然捐稅之課征，則工商業仍遠重土地。田賦徵實之後，地主負擔，平均仍不過地租收入百分之五，故此種形勢，依然存在。至於工業界之所特引爲危懼者，則爲所有資產多數爲日損月耗之房屋及機器，若依法定百分率，提存折舊準備，則因原價與現價之懸殊，勢將無法除舊布新。再執此以訐算盈餘，繳納稅款，則虛盈實稅之結果，流動資金日絀，將使生產逐步低落而終於無以爲繼。欲圖補救非不斷增資，即相互合併，以增力量。但言增資，則先求新舊股東權益之平衡，即須重估資產之價値。資產重估之結果，復見虛盈，復課實稅，則增資之收入，或不足以償稅捐之支出，是又不如不增資之爲愈。再言合併，則雙方亦須重估資產之價値，仍須繳納法定之稅捐，則其得不償失之情况，且較增資爲更甚。此爲直接稅所引起之困難。故在物價高漲之今日，稅捐已不爲收縮通貨之主要手段矣</p>
<p>所得稅及過分利得稅，原須以個人所得及利得爲課征之對象，始能達平均財富之目的，若以產業組織爲對象，則損害組織之發展者多，而影響個人之財富者微，勢將人人厭彙組織，相率化整爲零，實非得策。間接稅易爲商人之轉嫁稅款，恒須加計利潤，故課征者少，轉嫁者多，已成通例，對於民生必需品，再不能任其增加間接稅而刺激市價。消費稅之施行，僅在內地遍設關卡，加重貨運之負擔，自非物價之稱。</p>
<p>資金逃避之危機</p>
<p>原料高漲，即速於工業成品之高漲，經過一度再生產，即感資金之不足，益以虛盈實稅之影響，擁有資金者，相率化整爲零，從事讓位于商業上之囤積，或存放比期款項，以謀較大之利潤，並保資金之活動，孰後願冒巨險博薄利以投資於工業？一面資金需要，隨再生產之度數而累增，爾另一面資金來源，反益陷枯竭。工業界欲求維持其生產額，誠有心餘力絀之感。</p>
<p>解決工業資金問題治標之計，在於擴充工業貸款。但政府貸款每年總數　一萬數千萬元，而民營工礦事業之生產價値，全年不下一百萬萬元。貸款數額僅佔百分之二，此已充分顯示政府貸款之微小</p>
<p>運輸阻碍與多頭管制</p>
<p>運輸便利，則商貨來源暢旺，物資問題，自可减少其嚴重性，商人如無意外之煩擾，不特樂於營運，且可減低成本。物價亦可稍稍安定。工業界原料之獲得與成品之銷售，更均賴於運輸之便利。無如交通工具，即感缺乏：而關卡林立，任意扣留商貨，甚至擅作充公罰款之處分，人權物權無法律保障。徒藉增加稅收之名，不顧物資流通與物價趨漲之影響。况市爲一經濟單位，市區之內，工商業有互相依存之關係，更不能設立關卡於其間，强加支割，使市民負担，失其平衝。軍事機關及地方政府所設檢查機關，尤無明定查緝標準，往往干涉合法貨運。</p>
<p>今則機構重疊，政令紛歧，推諉留難，在所難免。有限之人力，因而往返於浪費曲折之中，寶貴之物質因而有消耗於腐蝕，損燬於砲火者。人民之損失大，阻礙多，能不視爲畏途者幾希。</p>
<p>回憶內地工業界，其中頗多間關萬里，歷萬險，冒萬難，以遷來此間者，原期生產力之保持與發展，在政府保護之下，實現國家工業化。今若遭遇如斯之因難環境，初非始料所及也。</p>

<p>工商界動熊</p>
<h3>上海企業界的先鋒　新亞建業股份有限公司</h3>
<p>在今日上海工商界紛紛運用游資從事投資的一個塲合下，新亞建業股份有限公司已經在十二月一日開幕了。各界對於該公司的稱道，已經詳見各報；母庸本報冉來贅錄了。却是這一個上海企業界的先鋒到底有什麼出類拔萃的地方，讓我們關心上海工商動態的人們，再在本報上爲社會公衆介紹一下。</p>
<p>（一）·新亞建業創辦的立塲與過程：</p>
<p>現代各國對於工商實業的投資，其方式蓋不出兩途：其一爲直接的投資，即將資金購買某一公司之股份，作爲對該公司單純性之投資。其二爲間接的投資，卽集合衆人之資財，設立以投資爲業務之組織，再由該組織視工商界的需要隨時運用其資金，或以創辦新事業，或以扶助已成的事業，促其發展，而間接獲得利潤·兩者輻輳而行，社曾經濟，賴以繁榮，乃爲必然的結果，尤其是後者以集體的資力，專家的眼光，對於工商實業的煦植旣多而投資者本身所獲利益，尤屬穩固而且優厚。此種以間接投資爲業務的組織，其投資之範圍，旣遠較直接投資爲廣，故其安全件亦較單純性的投資爲大。結果，其業務之發展當然可操左券。上海工商界的知名之士有鑒於此，於是集資國幣一千萬元，設立新亞建業股份有限公司，專以正當並且安全的投資爲業務；創辦之初，先以新亞各廠爲對象：俟事業有了相當成就，再以其餘緒，推及新亞範圍以外的　種生產事業。這樣看來，新亞建業公司的對象，早經於事前決定，並目都是基礎早奠的事業；一方面因勢而利導之，一方面相機而發展之。這樣一個立塲，可算是萬無一失，其所可得到的結果，必然是事半功倍。</p>
<p>該公司創辦的過程—也値得我們來略加叙述一下。新亞建業公司自經許冠羣，朱博泉，趙汝調，許寶驊，顧克民，李伯涵，邱良榮，史孑權，程慕願，曹畴玉，施作謀。于稻蓀等—都是創辦新亞事業垂　年者—發起以來。便假新閘路一〇九五號新亞藥廠爲籌備處。經過積極的籌備，除了發起人認足股款八百萬元外，其餘二百萬元，均儘新亞範圍以內的　廠股東認繳，在招股期滿的時候，認繳的股款，竟達五千萬元之多，結果，祗得將每一認股人所認的股數，比例核减，並將所繳股款溢出部份，分別予以退還。</p>
<p>（二）新亞肆業現在與未來投資之對象：</p>
<p>前面已經說過，新亞建業公司創辦之初，先以新亞各廠爲對象。新亞各廠的範圍，是包括新亞藥廠，新亞衛生材料廠，新亞血淸廠，新亞科學公司，新亞酵素工業廠，香　新亞藥廠等組織。新亞各廠所有資金之週轉，除各該廠自之資本外，以往都是靠着創辦人和各股東隨時挹注。二十年來，業務蒸蒸日上，新亞所出的藥品，近年來駸駸然有取歐美舶來藥品而代之的形勢。現在復有一個財力雄厚的投資組織爲其後盾，可以想見將來範圍之日趨廣大，規模之日趨宏偉了。（未完）</p>

<h3>一年來的大東亞戰爭</h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭，整整的一年了！</p>
<p>一年，這是東亞歷史上空前大變的一年！</p>
<p>一年，這是世界歷史上空前震動的一年！</p>
<p>在這一年間，英美帝國主義在太平洋上的殖民政策結束了，英美帝國主義勢力和他們那種壓榨與剝削亞洲各民族的帝國主義政策結束了，他們那種在亞洲的暴力像沸湯沃雪一般地被驅逐被消滅了！</p>
<p>在這一年間，亞洲各國和各民族，看到了日本的戰士，怎樣繼續着日俄戰爭之後，在短短的幾個月內，驅逐了一百多年以夾盤踞在太平洋上的英美帝國主義勢力，亞洲各國和各民挨，開始看到了在自己的祖宗所夢想不到的太平洋上的新局面！亞洲的民族，一向被侵略被輕視的民族，現在開始做起亞洲自巳的主人，太平洋自己的主人來了！</p>
<p>新的歷史在展開了！新的局面把每一個亞洲的和世界的人震驚了！</p>
<p>這一年劃分歷史時代的大變局，他的主要的動力是什麼呢？大東亞戰爭！</p>
<p>一　戰前的一般形勢</p>
<p>在大東亞戰爭前夕，太平洋的局勢是怎樣呢？</p>
<p>第一，太平洋上最大的兩個國家—中國和日本，雖然二年來已有和平的曙光，但是不幸的痛心的戰爭，還在繼續進行着！也就是說這一個戰爭已成爲東亞局勢的主題，已成爲英美帝國主義者利用以從中漁利的好機會！</p>
<p>第二，以太平洋上安定勢力—大東亞和平之主人自居的日本的處境，是到了空前危急的時候，以英美帝國主義者爲首的反日勢力，開始一步實行對日封鎖—從經濟上的封鎖，進展到所謂ABCD陣綫的軍事封鎖。特別是從德蘇戰爭爆發以後，英美在西方已可透一口氣，於是他們對日本的政策—對日本的壓迫便更積極起來了。在那時，日本稍一不愼，就會引起不堪設想的後果。</p>
<p>第三，日德義的三國條約雖已成立，然而三國被分割着各自迎擊其當面的敵人，彼此不能進一步密切地互相策應與援助。德義的作戰不能直接有助於日本，尤其是德蘇戰爭爆發以後，反使英美有機會來加重對日本的壓力；同樣的，日本的勢力亦不能對德義有多大的幫助，尤其是由於條約的關係，在德蘇作戰時，日本還不能不遵守中立，而且也沒有別的援助德義盟國的辦法。</p>
<p>從大東亞戰前日本的立塲說，國際形勢是不利的，而且這種不利的形勢，還在向前發展中。可是英美對日封鎖政策是兩面性的，他們一方面固然利用德蘇戰爭的空隙，採取了「遠東積極政策」，加緊對日本的封鎖，雷電交作，一似大雨之將臨，但是另一方面，如美駐日大使格魯，尤其是英國駐日大使克萊琪，都以親日的姿態，繼續對日進行「綏靖政策」，這種用心，固然仍舊是企圖緩和日本的戰備，企圖在「維持遠東現狀」的口號之下保全他們在太平洋上的地位。然而這種「綏靖與「封鎖」並進的政策，也正暴露了英美內部的矛盾和戰力的軟弱。所以日本就利用這一空隙，也展開了對英美的外交攻勢，野村以至來栖的赴美，本質上固然希望眞正和平的實現，但是外交失敗的結局，在日本是並非沒有先見的。</p>
<p>然而德蘇戰爭以後幾個月間的國際形勢是愈來愈嚴重了！特別是當冬季作戰開始以後，德國軍隊雖然已經包圍了莫斯科，但終於因爲天氣嚴寒由攻勢轉爲鞏固陣地的守勢了，乘着道種形勢的，就是英美帝國主義企圖利用冬季來加强對日本的壓迫。可是他們沒有料到，夢想也不曾想到，在這時期中，日本已完成了一切必要的戰爭準備了，不辭和英美作戰，而勇敢地發動歷史上空前的大東亞戰爭了。</p>
<p>二　勝利的戰史及其意義</p>
<p>十二月八日，對英美的宣戰大詔頒發了！</p>
<p>八日上午六時，日本大本營陸海軍部發表：「帝國陸海軍在西太平洋與英美軍進入戰　狀態」！</p>
<p>（一）夏威夷海戰</p>
<p>夏威夷距日本約三千一百浬，爲美國海軍渡洋進攻日本的重要根據地，美國建設珍珠灣軍港，投付十萬萬美元的巨款，與地中海的直布羅陀同爲世界二大軍港。美國海軍以夏威夷爲頂點，與阿拉斯加的凱企哈巴及巴拿馬構成三角形，作爲太平洋防禦綫，爲不許他國侵入的生命錢，而日本海軍就首先衝破了這個世界聞名的美國生命綫！第一天下午八時四十五分，日本大本營就發表了震　世界的戰果。</p>
<p>據十二月十八日日本大本營發表的夏威夷海戰的詳報，這一方面的美國海軍，已經完全覆滅，主要的戰果是：（一）擊沉戰艦五隻，甲級巡洋艦二隻，驅逐艦二隻。（二）重傷戰艦三隻，輕巡洋艦二隻驅逐艦二隻。（三）輕傷戰艦一隻，乙級巡洋艦四隻（四）　陸海航空兵力損害飛機的五十架，擊落十四架。又日潛艇轟沉戰艦一隻，日方損失爲飛機二十九架，未歸返的特殊潛航艇五隻。</p>
<p>綜合這次夏威夷海空戰爭的結果，日本在極短的時期，利用閃電戰術，出敵不意，收獲出人意　的戰果。使美國在太平洋上進攻日本的最大根據點失去了作用，使美國對日本本土的威脅失去了可能性。在大東亞戰史上，夏威夷奇襲的勝利，算是東亞新歷史的第一頁。</p>
<p>（二）消滅在華的英美駐兵</p>
<p>英美帝國主義在太平洋上維持其統治殖民地的重要工具之一，而且成爲中國近代史上國恥的便是英美在華駐軍，但這恥辱的歷史，終因十二月八日開始的大東亞戰爭而結束了。</p>
<p>八日上午十一時，日本上海睦海軍部隊，進駐蘇州河以南公共租界。北京，天津，秦皇島各地的美國陸戰隊的武裝，也於同日律解除。廣州方面，日軍亦於同日進駐沙面英租界。</p>
<p>（三）日軍進駐泰國</p>
<p>在大東亞戰爭之前，日泰關係，素稱友好。不過在戰爭前夕，英美加緊對泰國活動，希望把泰國作爲封銷日本的一個環節，所以在　東亞戰爭爆發的時候，日本就突然進駐泰國，取得了與越南進攻馬來的根據地；並目藉以隔絕馬夾和緬甸陸上的交通聯繫，同時又戚脅了滇緬路。</p>
<p>泰政府於十一日宣布日泰攻守同盟。那時英國飛機不　空襲泰國，至今年一月二十五日，泰政府就正式對央美兩國宣戰。</p>
<p>日本在大東亞戰爭中首先找到了泰國友　，從牠的地理環境，政治關係和軍事力量來說，使日本對南方的戰略與政略上，獲得有力的根據點，同時，使英美與重慶政權間失去了連絡，使緬甸和印度開始受到了威脅。</p>
<p>（四）馬來亞的海戰</p>
<p>在開戰三日內，日本海軍航空部隊在馬來半島東部海岸搜捕英國的遠東艦隊的主力，轟沉戰艦闌泊爾斯號和　國最著名的旗艦威爾斯號，消滅了英國遠東艦隊的主力。</p>
<p>馬來海戰勝利之後，也似夏威夷奇襲一樣地震動了英美的總參謀部，引起了英美兩國人民對政府的不滿，使英美不得小重新編制他們在亞細亞的海空軍與作戰指揮系統。因此自然無法在歐洲進行第二戰綫了。</p>
<p>（五）太平洋中央侵H路綫的破壞</p>
<p>在戰爭發動之初，日軍强襲夏威夷，馬尼拉，新加坡等英美的三大軍　據點，且一舉而覆滅他們的艦隊主力。</p>
<p>在開戰的第一星期，已經把美國在太平洋中央進攻日本的路綫加以澈底的破壞，誠如十二月十六日日本島田海相在第七十八屆臨時議會匕所報告的，「從夏威夷到東亞所有戰略和交通上的車要地點的機能已經破壞了」。</p>
<p>夏威夷—關島—馬尼拉—新加坡—這遙相聯，的一綫，是英美給予日本本土以重大威脅的包圍陳綫。過去美國根據其傳統的海軍政策，靠着他的艦隊和根據地—所謂海軍的二大要素，不惜耗費驚人的國防費，完成了「太平洋上的馬奇諾戰綫」，不僅美國的參謀總部以此自負，而且英國也對此抱有　大的期望，認鳥一旦日美開戰，如果英美合作，則日本不足一擊。那知事實與理想相反，這樣大包圍，封鎖和進攻日本的陣綫，却經不起日本海空軍的一擊，就完全崩潰了。</p>
<p>（六）香港之佔領</p>
<p>英國佔領香港，已經整整的一百年，爲英帝國主義者慘淡經營以爲侵略中國一大根據地。當日軍進佔廣州以後，香港即成爲英國和重慶政權的聯絡要點。</p>
<p>八日華南方面的日本陸車飛行隊，於淸晨急襲九龍飛機塲，給予重大的創傷。陸軍方面，早在微明以前，突越境界，九日夜，已經攻入九龍背面的防綫。</p>
<p>十二日即向九龍推進，肅淸英軍，立刻準備進　香港。十四日拂曉，開始對香港總攻，十八日夜，日軍在香港要塞的東部西部登陸。二十日，香港的西半部已入日軍之手。至二十五日下午芥時五十分港督要求停戰，無條件投降。二十六日，日軍正式進駐香港。</p>
<p>英帝國統治了一百年的香港，英帝國慘澹經營的侵略中國的香港，就在香港淪亡一百年昇起了日水帝國的旗幟，這還是歐戰以來英帝國第一次的失地。</p>

<h3>Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War</h3>
<p>It has been a full year since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. In this year, the overall situation in East Asia has undergone unprecedented changes, and the world situation has also been greatly affected. For more than a century, the power of Britain and the United States in East Asia has begun to collapse completely; the days of the Asian nations rising to self-determination have arrived!</p>
<p>Our Chinese nation, established in Asia, with cultural evolution spanning more than five thousand years, has a history that has shaken both China and foreign countries, with records continuously written. At present, we are standing in an unprecedented era. How can we shoulder the mission of one part of our Chinese nation? This is what we must constantly reflect upon and encourage ourselves to do.</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War is not just a war of Japan alone, and the impact of the war is not limited to Japan alone. This is very clear, so the people of all East Asian countries cannot stay outside the war, which is especially obvious. Then, in this time of war, how can we not have a correct understanding of the relationship between China and Japan and their future, and of the development prospects of this war? And how can we abandon our own responsibilities?</p>
<p>The above is what we dare to encourage our compatriots on this anniversary of the Greater East Asia War!</p>
<p>However, we must further look at the rapid progress and expanded results of the Greater East Asia War in the past year, which are rare in world history! However, in order to thoroughly complete the mission of the Greater East Asia War and establish a new order in East Asia and the world, the efforts and struggles of China, Japan, and other nations are still needed. This is truly an undeniable truth today, and it is something we should always be vigilant about.</p>
<p>Looking back to before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, China and Japan were both fighting for their respective national policies. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the relationship between China and Japan had to undergo fundamental changes. The necessity for mutual dependence and shared joys and sorrows between the two countries has reached a point where there is no room for hesitation or consideration! There is no doubt that Japan's need for Chinese cooperation has increased sharply. Conversely, considering China's current situation, the severity of its war tribulations and the suffering of its people are rare in our country's history and are well known to both the Japanese government and public. Therefore, China's need for Japanese cooperation is no less than Japan's need for our country.</p>
<p>However, looking back at the facts of the past year, the degree of mutual cooperation has not yet reached the ideal state, which is something that the authorities and people of both China and Japan should deeply reflect upon today. Looking at our country's side, the degree of cooperation is naturally not satisfactory, and the lack of self-motivated cooperation is particularly regrettable. As a result of our review, we feel that it is necessary to offer advice to the friendly nation's government and public on this great anniversary. That is, why is there a lack of voluntary cooperation among the Chinese people? It seems that in the past the Japanese government and public have not fully valued the power of our people. As the saying goes, "The people are the foundation of the nation," and "Government lies in winning the people." Only with the full support of the people's power can all policies be smoothly implemented, and cooperation with Japan can achieve ideal results. The so-called valuing of the people's power begins with cultivating the power of the masses, ensuring the minimum living standards of the people as the first step. Only when the people's lives are guaranteed and the people's power is cultivated can we automatically and actively strengthen Sino-Japanese cooperation and complete the great mission of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>At the same time, we are even more willing to offer advice to our country's government and public that we should not belittle ourselves and abandon our own strength. We must recognize that we have a decisive power in the Greater East Asia War! If our cooperation with Japan reaches a suitable level, we can complete the mission of the war ahead of schedule. Conversely, not only China and Japan, but all of East Asia will suffer unimaginable consequences. So, how should we actively unleash the power of the entire nation to cooperate with Japan? The first is to improve national politics and concentrate the power of the people, and the second is to awaken Chongqing from its dream of relying on Britain and the United States, and jointly cooperate with friendly nations for the total liberation of the East Asian nations and thoroughly eliminate the power of Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>"He who wins the people prospers" is the guiding principle for great politicians in our country's history. "Ten thousand people support as one" is the political program implemented in Japan during this Greater East Asia War. China and Japan, both past and present, attach great importance to the power of the people, which has a decisive effect. Therefore, on this anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, we solemnly put forward the above points.</p>
<p>Finally, we also take this opportunity to express our sincere condolences to the brave soldiers who sacrificed in the Greater East Asia War, and to wish China and Japan and all ethnic groups joint efforts to win the final victory—the liberation of East Asian nations!</p>

<h3>First Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War; Chairman Wang Elaborates on His Beliefs: China Must Cooperate with Japan to Advance Towards Coexistence and Co-prosperity</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing – On the eve of the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, Chairman Wang received Chinese and Japanese journalists at his official residence this afternoon. The journalists jointly raised three questions: (1) What about the long-term war system of Britain, the United States, and Chongqing? (2) What are your thoughts on the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War? (3) What are your expectations for the Japanese people? The Chairman answered as follows: "At dawn on December 8th of last year, Commander-in-Chief Hata and Temporary Ambassador to China Hidaka explained that Japan had begun the Greater East Asia War. Subsequently, successive reports of Japanese military victories in the attack on Pearl Harbor and the naval battle off the coast of Malaya proved that the Central American navy in the Pacific could not resist the Japanese army. Subsequently, British and American strongholds in the Pacific and elsewhere were successively captured by the Japanese army. The Philippines, Burma, and various British and Dutch colonies in Southeast Asia were also occupied by the Japanese army. This can be said to be the beginning of the decline of Anglo-American aggression in China and the construction of a true New Order for Greater East Asia. On the occasion of the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, I express my heartfelt admiration for the spirit, determination, and struggle of the officers and soldiers of the friendly nation's army and navy, as well as the people. The Japanese people may be concerned about (1) why China is not participating in the war with all its strength during the Greater East Asia War, and (2) why full peace has not yet been realized more than two years after the National Government returned to its capital. These two points are indeed regrettable for China itself. We, the comrades engaged in the peace movement, feel particularly guilty. When I started the peace movement, I strongly stated that China and Japan must cooperate. This kind of cooperation is active, not passive. Those who do not understand the true meaning of peace may think that peace is only to stop the war with Japan and for China to get rest after the war. This kind of explanation violates the true meaning of Pan-Asianism and, in particular, does not understand China's challenges and the mission of the times. The so-called mission of the times, in terms of the environment in which China and Japan are located (then the current war is) a total war, brooking no retreat. In terms of China's environment, it has reached the stage where it must participate in a national group. From this, it can be seen that peace is by no means passive, but must be active. In other words, it is not for passively seeking to recover from the exhaustion after the war, but for actively cooperating with Japan in accordance with Pan-Asianism and advancing towards coexistence and co-prosperity. What is most hateful is that the Chongqing side is still obstructing the peace movement. Its stubborn belief in relying on the United States and Britain has not awakened even after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. We have absolutely nothing to expect from Chiang Kai-shek today. What we expect is only the people of Chongqing. Therefore, it is our major responsibility at present to promote the awakening of the people under the rule of Chongqing and participate in the peace movement. Some people believe that Japan's victory should promote Chongqing's belief in Japan. This view has its reasons, but what is more important is to make the general public have the belief that China and Japan can only coexist and co-prosper through cooperation, and that they will certainly be able to coexist and co-prosper. It is more important to enable the people of Chongqing to have such a view than anything else. Based on this, practical cooperation in the Greater East Asia War is important, but on the other hand, it is important to promote understanding among the general public in Chongqing of the true meaning of coexistence and co-prosperity and its possibility. We deeply feel the importance of our responsibility, that is, to further cooperate with Japan wholeheartedly in the future to establish a model of peace. If this point can be thoroughly achieved, it will surely enable Chongqing to suddenly awaken and throw itself into the embrace of the peace movement. China is a part of East Asia, and China must become a strong wing of East Asia. This is our argument. In terms of the war situation, Japan is in charge of the front-line work, while China is in charge of the rear-area work. However, if the Chinese people know that cooperation in the war will lead to the realization of peace, they will be able to coexist and co-prosper. Then, they will be able to do their best in any cooperation and any sacrifice. When the war broke out last year, the National Government issued a statement of sharing joys and sorrows. The so-called sharing joys means coexistence and co-prosperity, and the so-called sharing sorrows means cooperation with one heart. In the future, the National Government and the Chinese people will certainly follow this purpose and advance together with Japan. I deeply trust that the friendly nation's people will share this purpose, constantly encourage and clearly point out a great road of coexistence and co-prosperity. This is also what I, on the eve of the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, wish to express sincerely to the Japanese people."</p>
<h3>Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War Celebrated in Various Places</h3>

<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Today (8th) is the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. In order to express the capital's people's celebration of the friendly forces' successive victories and their enthusiastic cooperation in the Greater East Asia War, the Capital People's Promoting Asia Congress for the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War will be held at the National Assembly Hall at 9:30 am.

<h3>Talk by Commander-in-Chief Hata: Determined to Carry Out the Destruction of Chongqing; Do Our Best to Assist the Development of Allied Nations</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – On the eve of the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, General Hata Shunroku, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Army in China, delivered a special talk, clarifying the determination of the Army in China to do its utmost to carry out operations against Chongqing. The general idea is that the Army in China has echoed the Southern Operations in the past year, suppressing the Chongqing army and the US Air Force in Chongqing, and destroying them at any time, suppressing Chongqing's resistance. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, although Chongqing's aspirations have been contrary to its wishes, its combat power has been greatly depleted, its economy has been increasingly difficult, and there is no hope for the future of the war of resistance, it still entrusts its fate to the world war and devotes all its efforts to trying to make a long-term protracted war. In the future, due to the advancement of the US Air Force's power in the Chinese mainland and the US attempt to counterattack, all this should not be underestimated. However, in this Greater East Asia War, the true intention of the Empire to save Asia has become clear. Chongqing's concept of resistance will eventually tend to collapse. Moreover, with the majesty of the Empire's army and navy on the Chinese front line, it is only natural that the US and the US cannot attempt to resist. It can also be said that the solution to the Chinese front is the main axis of the advancement of the Greater East Asia War. What we, the Army in China, want to express is that all the generals of the Army in China have a strong determination to overcome all difficulties and strive to destroy Chongqing. At the same time, the National Government and the Chinese people under its rule are also making every effort to cooperate closely with the Empire for the liberation of Asia and the independence of China, sharing hardships and striving to complete the Greater East Asia War. This is truly admirable. The authorities of the Army in China will also do their best to assist the development of allied nations in the future, in order to jointly complete the great task of revitalizing Asia. The officers and men of the Army in China respectfully follow the imperial edict and deeply engrave in their hearts the enthusiasm of the country. They will certainly uplift their morale, adhere to the current national policy, give full play to their strength, and strive to move forward in order to complete their mission as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Commemorating the Greater East Asia War; Reflections of Colonel Kamata, Chief of the Press Department of the Japanese Fleet in China: Eliminating British and American Forces and Creating Magnificent War Results; Resolving the Construction of a Co-prosperity and Happy Land for East Asian Nations</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Shanghai) – Today is the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. Colonel Kamata, Chief of the Press Department of the Japanese Fleet in China, recently issued his reflections. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>"When the Greater East Asia War broke out on December 8th of last year, our gratitude was beyond description. Looking around, the nations of our Greater East Asia had been groaning under the shackles of Britain and the United States for a hundred years. They had been constantly monopolized in terms of politics, economics, ideology, and culture. The gentle spirit of Greater East Asia was almost being chased into the depths of obscurity. We have always endured this insatiable ambition of Britain and the United States until today. This is because Japan is a nation that infinitely loves peace. In the past, Emperor Meiji said that all people within the four seas are brothers, how can there be unrest in the world? Reading the declaration of war issued by the Emperor of Japan on this day last year, we can also clearly know that Japan does not want to fight with other countries. However, the United States stubbornly adheres to the self-righteous Monroe Doctrine, using the open door, equal opportunity, and preservation of territory as slogans. In fact, it supports the old and selfish Nine-Power Treaty and the Washington System, constantly hindering the construction of a new co-prosperity sphere and the completion of the ideal of Greater East Asia. The attitude of Britain is also often the same as that of the United States. It monopolizes world trade and uses all kinds of schemes to maintain its own power. It once arrogantly claimed that if the Anglo-Saxons were not destroyed, there would be no hope for the development of other people. In order to recover East Asia from the hands of these arrogant and insolent British and Americans and restore the original appearance of each country's motherland, how should we sacrifice ourselves and resolutely rise up to deal with it? This is actually a cry of grief and indignation that cannot be stopped. In order to achieve the goal of each East Asian nation getting what it deserves, it is absolutely necessary to win the final victory. This is the so-called life-and-death gamble. Therefore, the one-shot-must-hit bullet condensed with the Japanese spirit instantly knocked down the 'Berthelot' and 'Wake' on the Huangpu River. This is not just the meaning of sinking one gunboat, but a symbol of the defeat of Britain and the United States being driven out of Greater East Asia. Sure enough, according to the subsequent reports, on the sea thousands of miles away in the Far East, the elite of the Japanese Imperial Navy fiercely attacked Pearl Harbor, the Pacific base of the American fleet. On December 10th, the British unsinkable battleship Prince of Wales and Repulse, which had always been boasted to the world, were also sunk by the Japanese army in the naval battle off the coast of Malaya. During the year, after the Java Sea battle, the Bali Island battle, the Surabaya battle, and the Batavia battle, the enemy ships were continuously wiped out. Later, the Indian Ocean operation, the Coral Sea battle, and the Solomon Sea battle all destroyed the enemy fleet, harvesting war results unprecedented in world war history. At present, the British and American forces entrenched in Greater East Asia have been completely driven out and wiped clean. The sea and air control of Greater East Asia have been taken into the hands of Japan. From the west coast of the United States in the east, to the Aleutian Islands in the north, from Australia in the south, across Madagascar in the west to the Atlantic Ocean, the vastness of the earth and the scale of the unparalleled operation can be found anywhere in world war history? I am afraid that this is an unprecedented and the largest operation that human beings cannot imagine. What is regrettable is that the Chongqing side has not yet awakened from its dream of resistance and is still being driven by Britain and the United States. The nature of the Sino-Japanese Incident has changed due to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. The purpose and reason for Japan's launching of the holy war is to defeat the British and Americans entrenched in East Asia and their followers who challenge Japan inseparably. Today, when the purpose and reason have been clarified, the Chongqing side still relies on Britain and the United States and makes futile resistance, which is truly sad. However, due to the impact of Japan's amazing war results and the retreat of Britain and the United States from Asia, it has already fallen into the abyss of decline and is now just lingering on its last breath. We will never relax our punishment for this last-ditch stupid action of Chongqing, and we will definitely move forward to complete the holy war purpose of our side at the beginning of the incident. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Navy units stationed in China have fought extremely bravely. Not to mention the scale is too large. The 3,000 nautical miles of the Chinese coast have been effectively blockaded. In order to suppress the defeated enemies who attempt to sabotage the rear, we have further exerted the power of the naval aviation, fiercely bombing the strongholds of Chongqing. We have also used unparalleled elite troops to ensure long-distance inland river transportation and gradually control the important areas of Chongqing. Due to the control of the sea and air control along the Chinese coast, we have established a system to destroy any foreign enemy from the West Pacific. We are convinced that the Greater East Asia War has established an absolutely invincible system. We must not show any leniency to the enemy forces that attempt to act recklessly in the vast ocean and must completely destroy them. At the same time, we must not forget the strong self-reflection of winning without arrogance. This is to appease the emperor above and comfort the heroic spirits of the comrades who sacrificed their lives for the country below. According to Washington news, the United States is observing a day of silence today, and Roosevelt has suspended all speeches and talks. The reason is that the American fleet suffered a disastrous defeat in the Pearl Harbor battle, which is a shameful day for the United States. From this, we can see how strong Japan's strength is. On the occasion of the first anniversary of the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, thinking that the purpose of the war is to liberate the nations of Greater East Asia and build a truly co-prosperous and happy land, the future is bright and limitless, and how can we not be happy? We also hope that we will not be satisfied with today's victory and that it is necessary to make a decision to respond to the new stage of the war."</p>
<h3>Ambassador Shigemitsu's Statement: Japan Has Unwavering Determination; Hopes Allied Nations Will Cooperatively Advance the War</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 7th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - On the eve of the first anniversary of the war, Ambassador Shigemitsu issued a statement tonight, saying that the development of the Greater East Asia War over the past year shows that the Japanese people have an unwavering determination and will cooperate with the people of Japan's allied nations to advance the war until Japan and East Asia achieve final victory. The peoples of East Asia should know that it is time for Asia to rise. The people of all East Asian countries must cooperate with each other, overcome difficulties, and work together to complete the victory of the Greater East Asia War. The outbreak of the Greater East Asia War connected the China Incident with the world war that influenced the world. However, before the outbreak of this war, the United States and Britain had already used the China Incident to implement their aggressive policies in East Asia. Chongqing, like a puppet, danced to the tune of the United States and Britain. Now that the new war has broken out, Britain and the United States have torn off their masks and provoked us. The war against the century-old power of Britain and the United States in East Asia has thus broken out. We are now cooperating with our friendly nations of Germany and Italy to build a new world order and are writing a new transformation in world history. The Japanese ambassador also relayed the National Government's statement that since the National Government returned to Nanjing, it has been rapidly advancing in politics, economy, culture, and society. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, China and the Japanese Empire have shared weal and woe, working to revive China and defend East Asia. No matter how long the war lasts and how difficult daily life is, we will never lose our confidence in cooperating with our allied nations and will surely win.</p>
<h3>Minister Tajiri Issues a Statement</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Shanghai dispatch) - Today is the first anniversary of the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Japanese Minister Tajiri specially issued a statement entitled "Confidence and Determination in the Second Year of the Greater East Asia War." The main points are recorded as follows: The Greater East Asia War has entered its second year starting today. Looking back to this day last year, we respectfully read the Imperial Rescript declaring war on Britain and the United States, vowing with the belief of certain victory and an unwavering determination. For a year, under the Emperor's authority, the army and navy soldiers have carried out fierce battles in all aspects, whether on land, sea, or air, establishing unprecedentedly glorious achievements in world war history. The power of Britain and the United States has been completely driven out of Greater East Asia. We must win without arrogance, further consolidate our certain victory posture, strengthen cooperation with allied nations, and devote all our efforts to overthrow the enemy's plans. Under these circumstances, entering the second year of the war, there are two issues that we should re-recognize. First, today's Japan is no longer the island nation of Japan, but the Japan of Greater East Asia, the Japan of the world, that is, the Japan that combines the morally righteous vitality to transform world history with the power to destroy evil and reveal righteousness. Second, there are still remnants of the evil roots of Anglo-American materialistic civilization, egoism, and liberalism in our minds, which should be cleared away as soon as possible. Currently, on the thousands of miles of front lines, the Imperial Army soldiers, whether affected by the cold or hit by the heat waves, are working hard day and night, bravely advancing to defend Greater East Asia and build a new Japan. We are sincerely grateful and cannot express it in words. At the same time, whether in the economic war or in the ideological war, we will advance with the same will as the soldiers on the front lines, further consolidate, and acquire the determination to win the post-war victory.</p>
<h3>Consul General Yano Encourages East Asians</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Shanghai dispatch) - Mr. Yano, the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, recently issued a statement to commemorate the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, as follows: Today, as we joyfully celebrate the first anniversary of the war, with the promulgation of the Imperial Rescript and the repeated victories of the Japanese army, creating unprecedented achievements in war history, we are extremely fortunate. At the same time, we increasingly hope for the continued military success of the soldiers fighting on the front lines, and we can only bow our heads in silent prayer for the heroic spirits who died for the holy war, expressing our heartfelt gratitude. The reason why we call the Greater East Asia War a holy war is that the purpose of the war is to extend morality and justice to East Asia, and then spread it to the world, that is, to hope that justice and humanity can be realized among human beings. The great victories of the Japanese army are due to the superiority of weapons, but in fact, they are due to the will of the soldiers, that is, the belief in certain victory. Extending this example, the foundation for cultivating combat power lies in the will of the people. The people must truly unite, with one heart and one mind. If everyone realizes that this holy war is a holy war for every citizen, then the situation of certain victory and invincibility can be established. The so-called war of every citizen means that, regardless of one's profession, one should fight against people of the enemy country in the same professional field. Our soldiers should be better than the soldiers of the enemy country, officials should be better than the officials of the enemy country, businessmen should be better than the businessmen of the enemy country, and technicians should be better than the technicians of the enemy country. If we can consider this with such sincerity, then the situation of total war can be established immediately.</p>

<h3>Another Announcement to the National People</h3>
<p>— Wang Zhaoming</p>
<p>—How to Share Weal and Woe—</p>
<p>Today last year, our friendly nation Japan launched the Greater East Asia War. The National Government immediately issued a statement, resolving to share weal and woe with our friendly nation Japan. Since then, the Japanese army, navy, and air force have been victorious in every battle and have captured every place they attacked. For a century, the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States in East Asia have been swept away. There is no longer room for Britain and the United States to be rampant in the Eastern Pacific and the South Seas. Their colonies, from the Philippines in the east to Burma in the west, and including the Malay Archipelago and the Dutch East Indies in the south, have been lost one after another. On the one hand, it is the decline of the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States. On the other hand, it is the beginning of East Asian co-prosperity. In just one year, the achievements of our friendly nation Japan have been so great. This is deeply gratifying. While celebrating, we remember the officers and soldiers on the front lines of our friendly nation and the people at home who have been working tirelessly day and night, achieving this unprecedented great undertaking with a spirit of hardship and perseverance. We are truly filled with admiration. On the occasion of the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, I would first like to express my heartfelt wishes and respect to the government of our friendly nation, the officers and soldiers on the front lines, and all the people.</p>
<p>The victory of the Greater East Asia War is the foundation for the establishment of East Asian co-prosperity. If we want to fully realize East Asian co-prosperity, we must continue to strive for the completion of the Greater East Asia War. After paying tribute to our friendly nation, I must say something frankly to the Chinese people.</p>
<p>We are determined to share weal and woe with our friendly nation Japan, but how do we share weal and woe? Let me first explain the meaning of sharing weal and woe.</p>
<p>I have used farming to explain the meaning of sharing weal and woe. When cultivating, everyone sweats and toils in the fields, experiencing hardship. This is sharing woe. When harvesting, everyone gathers in the countryside, tasting the new grains and enjoying satiety. This is sharing weal. From this, we can know that we must first share woe and then share weal. Sharing woe is the present, faithful effort. Sharing weal is the certain hope for the future.</p>
<p>Barbarian peoples do not know how to share weal and woe. They only know how to take happiness for themselves and give suffering to others. From this, hatred, jealousy, and acts of killing arise. Civilized peoples are different. From a negative perspective, it is "do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself." From a positive perspective, it is "if you want to establish yourself, establish others; if you want to succeed, help others succeed." This is the sharing of weal and woe between people. From a moral perspective, it is "sharing good with others." From a lifestyle perspective, it is sharing joy with others. Confucius said it well, "People do not only love their own parents, nor only care for their own children." Mencius said it well, "Those who rejoice in the joy of others will also rejoice in their own joy; those who grieve in the sorrow of others will also grieve in their own sorrow." The essence of Eastern morality is none other than benevolence and forgiveness. This is the moral creed between people, and it is also the sharing of weal and woe between people.</p>
<p>Extending from the relationship between people to the relationship between countries, countries that follow utilitarianism, like barbarian peoples, do not know how to share weal and woe. For example, imperialism treats colonies as if they only know how to extract their labor and resources to provide for their own enjoyment. In peacetime, they place themselves in the utmost happiness and put others in the utmost suffering. In wartime, they force people to endure suffering and never allow them to share weal. Even if they allow it, it is just empty words. The last world war, Britain's treatment of India, is the most obvious example. For this reason, the Indian people, even if they want to remain united, cannot do so.</p>
<p>The above is a reference to the example of only knowing how to share woe with others and not knowing how to share weal with others. But there are also some countries that only know how to share weal with others and do not share woe with others. For example, during the last world war, some countries did not try their best to assist in the war, but after the war, they took advantage of the opportunity to share the benefits. These benefits were not obtained through labor, or at least obtained significant benefits with minimal labor. Such benefits cannot be guaranteed forever, and may even lead to disaster. These examples are too numerous to mention. In short, only knowing how to share woe and not knowing how to share weal is selfish and cruel. Only knowing how to share weal and not knowing how to share woe is opportunistic and cunning. The former is a crime that powerful countries easily commit, and the latter is a crime that weak countries easily commit. Tracing their roots, they are all due to utilitarianism. We Eastern countries must replace Western utilitarianism with a spirit of morality.</p>
<p>The morality between people is benevolence and forgiveness, and the morality between countries is also benevolence and forgiveness. Based on benevolence and forgiveness, we practice the sharing of weal and woe between countries. The so-called sharing of woe is not just passively sharing suffering, but also actively struggling together in suffering. It is not just enduring suffering with the greatest courage, but also relieving suffering with the greatest effort. The so-called sharing of weal is not just aiming to share happiness, but also continuously creating happiness together with the greatest effort, in order to enjoy it together. This is the greatest significance of the National Government's declaration of sharing weal and woe.</p>
<p>Now, let us further explain how to share weal and woe. First, from a psychological perspective, the psychology of resistance in the past was "resistance is death, non-resistance is also death; rather than die without resisting, it is better to die resisting." This argument came from pessimism. In addition, it was mixed with the hope of British and American aid and cooperation with the Communist Party. This was a state of confusion. The peace movement first transformed this psychology, believing that peace could save the country and that there was no need to be pessimistic. As for relying on British and American aid and cooperation with the Communist bandits, it was like drinking poison to quench thirst. This was a head-on psychological transformation. By the time the Greater East Asia War broke out, the psychology of the peace movement had gone even further. The entire East Asia was facing a critical juncture of life and death. Any country or nation located in East Asia was either an ally of East Asia or a traitor to East Asia. The Greater Asianism advocated by the Founding Father was no longer an ideal, but a current reality. Unless the Chinese people do not want to save the country, if they want to save the country, there is no other way than to defend East Asia. Defending East Asia is saving the country, and saving the country and defending East Asia are the same thing, not two different things. In the past, we only said that peace could save the country and that there was no need to continue resisting. Now, if we want to save the country, we can only cooperate with Japan to defend East Asia. The so-called continued resistance is only being used by Britain and the United States to help the Communist bandits shout. From the perspective of defending East Asia, it is an act of betrayal. From the perspective of saving the country, it is an act of vermin. This psychological transformation is indeed a further step than the initial peace movement, and it is indeed the original purpose of the National Revolution, the original face of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>The meaning of building a new order in East Asia lies on the one hand in eliminating British and American imperialism, and on the other hand in eliminating communism, and re-establishing a situation based on morality. The New Citizens Movement, based on this meaning, has more specifically defined the transition from narrow nationalism to national groupism, from individualism to collectivism, and from private capitalism to state capitalism. This is to thoroughly transform the spiritual outlook in politics, economy, and culture. To accomplish this great mission, we need the combined efforts of people in the country, and at the same time, we need the exchange of ideas between Chinese and Japanese people. From the exchange of ideas, we can gradually lead to consistency of action. To work together to overcome all difficulties is to share woe. To support each other and walk together on the road to light is to share weal. This is pointing out the meaning of sharing weal and woe from a psychological perspective. From an environmental perspective, in the Greater East Asia War, Japan stands on the front line, and China is located in the rear. After years of exhaustion in China, we are truly apprehensive about cooperation. However, the responsibilities of the rear cannot be ignored. Establishing security and improving people's livelihoods are the greatest guidelines of the National Government since its return to the capital, and they are also the greatest tasks of China, located in the rear, in the Greater East Asia War. In terms of establishing security, on the negative side, it is to eliminate the Communist bandits so that they can no longer harass the localities. On the positive side, it is still based on psychological transformation, so that the general public understands the great cause, each works hard in their own position. All current anti-bandit work, as well as all security work, the friendly nation's officers and soldiers, in the midst of their busy work, give us all kinds of assistance, and we also actively move forward, not avoiding any difficulties and dangers. These are all constantly demonstrating the meaning of seeking shared weal through shared woe. In terms of improving people's livelihoods, the greatest current suffering is the lack of materials and soaring prices. We must analyze in these sufferings which are unavoidable sufferings and which are avoidable sufferings. For example, the decline in production due to the lack of full peace and the disruption of transportation due to the incomplete Greater East Asia War. These sufferings are unavoidable, we can only bear them with great courage based on the meaning of sharing woe, and do our best to increase production, restore transportation, and save on consumption. We recognize that these sufferings are not only unavoidable phenomena, but also the heavy responsibilities that we should bear, overcoming the bad environment with a tense mood. As for the imperfections in economic institutions, the unsoundness of social organizations, and the various shortcomings in personnel and technology, which have not been improved, these are avoidable sufferings. We can only base on the meaning of sharing woe, without selfish or self-interested intentions, without following old ways and being content with the present, without favoritism, and without avoiding obstacles, and strive to correct the shortcomings. In this way, we will be able to gradually reduce and eliminate all kinds of sufferings. In short, if these complex problems do not have a consistent spirit, they will only become more complex on top of complexity, hitting walls everywhere, and being constrained everywhere. If we are based on the psychology of sharing weal and woe, we will be able to take care of each other and help each other without hesitation, and we will be able to make complexity simple. This is pointing out the meaning of sharing weal and woe from an environmental perspective.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the so-called sharing of weal refers to the future co-existence and co-prosperity of China and Japan, and the so-called sharing of woe refers to the current cooperation between China and Japan, working together to overcome all difficulties. The compatriots of the whole country must know that great light is in sight, with firm beliefs and unwavering aspirations. At the same time, we must also know that only effort can approach the light and reach the light. Compatriots of the whole country, please come forward quickly, with a spirit of courage, diligence, perseverance, and hard work, to complete the mission of revitalizing China and defending East Asia.

<h3>The Suffering of Chongqing's Industrial Sector</h3>
<p>The issue of resources is the most pressing problem for the Chongqing government at present, especially as international connections are severed, further exacerbating the severity. Intensifying industrial production to increase resource wealth has become an urgent requirement within the mainland. However, the government's measures often miss the mark, nominally assisting but in reality undermining. The environment encountered by the industrial sector and the current reality directly contradict the goal of "increasing production." The ills can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>General Ills of the Industrial Sector</p>
<p>(A) Lack of Security for Enterprises: Factories lack reliable protection. Generally, those who invest in industry view it as wartime speculation. Prudent individuals are unwilling to invest boldly, while those seeking shortcuts focus solely on pursuing exorbitant profits, not hesitating to raise prices. Those who operate with genuine integrity constantly feel the pain of an unstable environment.</p>
<p>(B) Imbalanced Price Control Policies: The imbalance of price control policies forces some industries to maintain their existence through idling. Price control organizations often focus solely on suppressing the prices of industrial finished products, but fail to simultaneously suppress the prices of raw materials. Consequently, industrialists buy raw materials at high prices and sell finished products at low prices, inevitably incurring losses. Under these circumstances, in order to reduce losses, industrialists can only prolong the production process or reduce output, waiting for an increase in the approved selling price of products. This phenomenon was first seen in the flour milling industry.</p>
<p>(C) Uneven Distribution of Power and Raw Materials: The allocation of power and raw materials has not been based sufficiently on the needs of the people, striving for rationality. Consequently, some industries not essential to people's livelihoods, possessing superior influence, can obtain a sufficient supply of power and raw materials, allowing them to manufacture as much as possible. Meanwhile, some industries directly related to people's livelihoods, lacking connections, suffer the regret of being left out. Furthermore, since all seaports have been blockaded, the lack of imported industrial raw materials is increasingly felt, posing a current industrial crisis. Since the Ministry of Military Administration began centralizing the purchase of metals and electrical materials, privately-run factories have suffered greatly. Although it is said that military affairs come first during wartime, efforts should still be made to adjust surpluses and deficits, allowing privately-run industries a chance to breathe.</p>
<p>(D) Exhaustion of Capital: Due to skyrocketing prices, there is a widespread exhaustion of industrial capital. The reason for losses in running industries currently lies in the fact that after each turnover of capital, the capital decreases. However, even those who make a profit often feel that their capital is insufficient after each turnover. This is because the profit that can be obtained is not enough to offset the high prices. The lack of capital prevents many industries from fully realizing their production capacity.</p>
<p>The difficulties of the industrial sector mentioned above cannot be corrected by the industrial sector itself without appropriate government measures. Therefore, industrial colleagues, united as the Relocated Factories Association of Sichuan, the Southwest Industrial Association, and the Chongqing National Products Manufacturers Association, have issued calls reflecting the difficulties and expectations of the industrial sector. These calls further reflect and prove the inadequacy of government measures.</p>
<p>Unreasonable Tax Burden</p>
<p>During wartime, the biggest premise of taxation is to shrink the currency and stabilize prices. Therefore, taxes must be levied where currency is located, and those that stimulate price increases must be avoided as much as possible. In the past two years, the prices of agricultural products have risen far more than domestically produced industrial goods and general commodities. Therefore, currency inflation is no longer in urban industry and commerce, but in rural land. However, taxes are still levied far more heavily on industry and commerce than on land. After the in-kind collection of land tax, the burden on landlords still averages only about 5% of land rent income, so this situation still exists. As for what the industrial sector particularly fears, it is that most of their assets are houses and machinery that depreciate daily and monthly. If depreciation reserves are set aside according to the statutory percentage, due to the disparity between the original price and the current price, it will be impossible to replace old with new. Furthermore, if this is used to calculate profits and pay taxes, the result of taxing illusory profits will be a daily depletion of working capital, causing production to gradually decline and eventually become unsustainable. To remedy this, it is necessary to continuously increase capital or merge with each other to increase strength. However, when it comes to increasing capital, it is first necessary to seek a balance between the rights and interests of old and new shareholders, which requires reassessing the value of assets. The result of asset reassessment is again illusory profits, and again real taxes are levied. The income from increasing capital may not be enough to offset the expenditure on taxes, so it is better not to increase capital. When it comes to mergers, both parties must also reassess the value of their assets and still pay statutory taxes. The situation of not being able to recoup the losses is even worse than increasing capital. This is the difficulty caused by direct taxes. Therefore, in today's environment of high prices, taxation is no longer the main means of shrinking the currency.</p>
<p>Income tax and excessive profit tax should originally target individual income and profits in order to achieve the goal of equalizing wealth. If they target industrial organizations, they will harm the development of organizations more and affect individual wealth less, inevitably causing everyone to dislike organizational structures and dismantle them into smaller units, which is not a good strategy. Indirect taxes are easily passed on by merchants, who always add profits, so those who levy them are few and those who pass them on are many, which has become common practice. It is no longer possible to allow indirect taxes to increase on necessities for people's livelihoods, stimulating market prices. The implementation of consumption taxes only involves setting up checkpoints everywhere in the mainland, increasing the burden of freight, which is certainly not in line with the price increase.</p>
<p>Crisis of Capital Flight</p>
<p>The rise in raw materials is faster than the rise in industrial finished products. After each round of reproduction, the lack of capital is felt. Coupled with the impact of taxing illusory profits, those who possess capital dismantle them into smaller units, engaging in hoarding in commerce or depositing fixed-term funds to seek greater profits and ensure the liquidity of capital. Who would then be willing to risk huge amounts for meager profits to invest in industry? On the one hand, the need for capital increases cumulatively with the degree of reproduction, while on the other hand, the source of capital becomes increasingly depleted. The industrial sector sincerely feels that it lacks the strength to maintain its production volume.</p>
<p>The expedient way to solve the problem of industrial capital is to expand industrial loans. However, the total annual amount of government loans is only tens of millions of yuan, while the production value of privately-run industrial and mining enterprises is no less than one million yuan per year. The loan amount accounts for only 2%, which fully demonstrates the smallness of government loans.</p>
<p>Transportation Obstacles and Multi-Headed Control</p>
<p>Convenient transportation ensures smooth sources of goods, and the problem of resources can naturally be reduced in severity. If merchants are free from unexpected disturbances, they will not only be happy to operate, but also reduce costs. Prices can also be slightly stabilized. The industrial sector's acquisition of raw materials and the sale of finished products both rely on convenient transportation. Unfortunately, there is a lack of transportation vehicles, and checkpoints are everywhere, arbitrarily detaining merchants' goods, even arbitrarily confiscating them as fines, without legal protection for human rights or property rights. They merely increase tax revenue in name, disregarding the impact on the flow of goods and the trend of rising prices. Moreover, a city is an economic unit, and industry and commerce within the city area have interdependent relationships. Checkpoints cannot be set up in between, forcibly dividing them, causing the citizens to bear burdens and losing their balance. The inspection agencies established by military organizations and local governments have no clearly defined inspection standards, often interfering with legitimate freight.</p>
<p>Now, organizations overlap, government orders are inconsistent, and shirking responsibility and creating difficulties are unavoidable. Limited manpower is thus wasted on circuitous routes, and valuable materials are consumed by corrosion or damaged by artillery fire. The losses to the people are great, and there are many obstacles. Few can view this as anything but a daunting path.</p>
<p>Recalling the inland industrial sector, many have traveled tens of thousands of miles, experienced countless dangers, and overcome countless difficulties to relocate here, originally hoping to maintain and develop their productivity and realize national industrialization under the protection of the government. Now, to encounter such a difficult environment was certainly not anticipated.</p>

The sublease licenses for the period from January to the end of June next year have been scheduled to begin issuing applications from the 14th of this month. To facilitate the collection of licenses in various districts, the following locations have been designated where they can be collected nearby: (1) 788 Seymour Road, (2) 1 Jessfield Road, (3) 160 Macdonnell Road, (4) 11 Singapore Road, (5) 1461 Sinza Road, (6) 130 Haining Road, (7) 270 North Fujian Road, (8) 558 Qiwupu Road, (9) 153 Zhoushan Road. The deadline for issuing these application forms is the 23rd of this month. After collecting them, they must be filled out item by item, and the license fee (48 yuan for houses with more than six rooms, 18 yuan for houses with six or fewer rooms) must be attached to the application form and paid at the licensing office on the designated date to exchange for a new license. If the deadline is exceeded, a late fee will be added according to the number of days exceeded as a penalty. This method is being implemented for the first time and will inevitably be strictly enforced. Therefore, sub-landlords should understand the advantages and disadvantages and not hesitate.</p>

He has now returned to Shanghai after completing his official duties and issued a statement saying that this time, he accompanied Lieutenant General Matsui to inspect the actual progress of the work of clearing villages in the suburbs of Shanghai. In addition to visiting the Shanghai Branch of the Clearing Village Committee, he also went to Nanhui Zhoupu and other places to inspect and review the security forces and hold instruction ceremonies.

The future is extremely promising.</p>
<h3>Materials Control Department Handles Registration of Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth: Registration Date from the 10th to the 15th, Those Who Do Not Register Will Not Be Able to Move Them Later</h3>
<p>After the Municipal Council established the Materials Control Department, the various offices for flour, food, and other items were merged under the department's jurisdiction. The office is located in Room 90 of the Municipal Council Building. Starting yesterday, the registration and movement of cotton cloth (including processed and white cloth) and cotton yarn were handled. From yesterday (7th) to the 9th, the three days are for issuing registration certificates. There are three types of certificates: (1) Cotton Yarn Registration Certificate, (2) White Cloth Registration Certificate, (3) Processed Cotton Cloth Registration Certificate.</p>
<p>Those Who Do Not Register Cannot Move Them</p>
<p>Each certificate is sold for two yuan in Central Reserve Certificates. Each storage location is considered a unit, which requires filling out one certificate. After the certificate issuing date ends on the 9th, all owners of cotton yarn or cotton cloth must fill out the certificate from the 10th to the 15th and send it to the Control Department. Each item must be filled out accurately and truthfully. If the registration procedures are not completed by the deadline, they will be confiscated once discovered.</p>
<p>Three Types of Certificates, Categories</p>
<p>The Datong News Agency reporter inquired that after the registration procedures are completed, future movements must be applied for to the Control Department. As for the types of cotton cloth and cotton yarn registration, according to the registration form, cotton yarn includes fine and coarse counts. White cloth includes coarse cloth, linen cloth, powder bag cloth, crepe, coarse and fine twill, straight tribute, flannel, and other white cloth. Processed cloth includes colored cotton cloth, such as black, bleached, blue, various colors, and fine woven categories.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cloth Allocation Control Association</p>
<p>After the two concession authorities implemented the maximum price limit for cotton yarn and cotton cloth on the 1st of this month, in order to thoroughly control yarn and cloth prices, a rationing system will be adopted for yarn and cloth. Although the specific plan has not yet been decided, in general, major yarn and cloth merchants (including Chinese and Japanese merchants) will jointly invest in kind to form a Yarn and Cloth Allocation Control Association. All allocation matters will be handled by the association. For small-scale yarn and cloth businesses, all yarn and cloth will be purchased by the Yarn and Cloth Allocation Control Association.</p>
<h3>Traffic in the Lao Zha District Was Blocked Once Yesterday</h3>
<p>All roads in the Lao Zha District were blocked once at around 2:15 PM yesterday due to a terror drill. Traffic was temporarily interrupted for about half an hour before returning to normal.</p>
<h3>The Silver and Money Industry Joint Conference Decided on the Method of Transferring the Dao Deed Deposit, Applying for the Lifting of Enemy Property Treatment</h3>
<p>The Silver and Money Industry Joint Association recently issued a notice to its member banks and shops, stating that regarding the Japanese authorities' proclamation of October 10th, if the true owner of real estate is a non-enemy national, they may apply for the lifting of enemy property treatment and the transfer of the Japanese register Dao deed within three months, otherwise their rights will not be recognized. Most banks and money shops have</p>
<p>Dao Deed Deposits</p>
<p>relationships, which are very important. Therefore, a small group meeting of the Banking Association studied and discussed several items in detail, and proposed a method. This meeting decided to pass the proposed method. Now, the small group meeting's resolution is recorded for your reference. The method decided by the small group meeting is as follows: (1) For all customers of silver and money industry member banks and shops who hold deposit receipts or other documents from various banks and shops regarding Dao deeds, except for foreign firms from neutral countries registered with the consulates of neutral countries, Dao deeds registered with the consulates of other countries should be applied for by the relevant banks and shops to lift enemy property treatment and</p>
<p>Exchange for the Japanese Register</p>
<p>Dao deed, without the need to add additional endorsements on the original receipt or other documents. (2) For all customers notified by various banks and shops, if they fail to complete the power of attorney within the prescribed date, the application procedures may be handled directly by the various banks and shops without further notification to avoid delays. (3) For Dao deeds that have not been transferred and are used as deposits, if customers still do not come to the banks and shops to jointly apply for the lifting of treatment and exchange the Japanese register Dao deed, or do not come to the banks to exchange the deposit after being notified by the various banks and shops, the various banks and shops may limit the debtors to redeem the deed. It is heard that various banks and shops have already complied and have separately informed customers who have previously pledged Dao deeds (1) those who have not transferred to the accounts of the various banks and shops, and (2) those who have transferred to the accounts of the various banks and shops, to handle the application for transfer matters.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Council Solemnly Declares that it Will Continue to Supply Rice and Flour: The Rumor of Food Ration Disruption is Groundless, and the Supply of Oil, Salt, and Sugar Will Continue</h3>
<p>Recently, various parties in Shanghai have attached great importance to the issue of people's food. The Municipal Council solemnly declares that in addition to continuing to supply food rations, major food items such as sugar, oil, and salt have also been adjusted by various control departments to the best of their ability. On the one hand, they are smoothing the source of goods, and on the other hand, they are distributing them fairly, hoping to match supply and demand and maintain the stability of people's food. As for minor food items such as meat, poultry, and vegetables, the source has not been lacking recently, and the price differences are also noteworthy.</p>
<p>Rice and Grain</p>
<p>The Municipal Council Information Office announced yesterday: "It has been found that unscrupulous people dare to spread rumors that the supply of rice and flour by this bureau will be stopped. This bureau solemnly declares that the above rumors are completely groundless. This bureau welcomes reports of the source of the rumors. The rumor of food ration disruption is completely a case of groundless worry, and its source may be the tricks of rice peddlers. The higher the price of national rice, the more prevalent the rumors, and the higher the profits for rice peddlers. Now that the Municipal Council has declared this, the rumors will be debunked."</p>
<p>Sugar</p>
<p>The allocation of sugar this month has been increased to 30,000 bags. Although there is still a phenomenon of queuing to buy, there is no difficulty in buying it for the time being. A few days ago, 60,000 bags of Taiwan sugar arrived in Shanghai, and Shanghai has now joined the Hong Kong-Philippines trade agreement. Therefore, it is hoped that sugar from the Philippines can be transported to Shanghai to maintain the supply. The current problem is how to obtain the understanding of the military distribution combination and increase the monthly allocation.</p>
<p>In order to avoid congestion, the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office has increased the number of retail sugar merchants for door-to-door sales, strictly supervising sales to prevent malpractices. The December sugar allocation has been prepared, such as issuing sugar purchase certificates to various retailers. The improved method of selling sugar based on house donation tickets after December will be announced by the cooperative at that time to facilitate purchases by genuine food households. For those who need sugar due to business needs, the office adopts a permission system to grant special allocations. The allocation rate is determined according to the actual needs of each industry. It is stipulated that the sugar allocated under special circumstances is limited to the applicant's business needs and must not be sold privately. If it is discovered, it will be investigated and the allocation right will be permanently suspended.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>The Shanghai Cooking Oil Industry Wholesale Office purchased 10,000 piculs of cooking oil from the military distribution authorities last month. 5,500 piculs were transported to Shanghai in mid-month and distributed to registered cooking oil retail stores for door-to-door sales. It is now known that there are still 4,500 piculs to be transported from Pudong to Shanghai yesterday. The same method will be used to distribute them to various cooking oil retail stores. If there are no procedural delays, the retail cooking oil stores will be able to sell them door-to-door tomorrow (9th) and the day after (10th). Each person is still limited to buying half a catty per day. In order to prevent abuses, the office has now dispatched personnel to supervise sales at various retail stores on the same day to prevent various cooking oil stores from deducting the quantity of oil sold. It is also heard that smaller oil stores will be merged into one place and sold in rotation in batches to facilitate supervision.</p>
<p>Salt</p>
<p>Salt is now controlled by Yumo Salt Company. Starting this month, salt will be fairly distributed to each sub-salt store or sauce workshop according to the population of each joint guarantee area. For example, if the population of a certain joint guarantee area is 1,000, then all the salt in that joint guarantee area can be obtained by the sales store at 1,000 catties of salt per month (based on one catty per person). However, the amount of salt that each citizen can buy is not limited to one catty and can be purchased without restriction. Yumo Salt Company is now making every effort to crack down on the private sale of salt and is reviewing the account books and sales volume of each salt store or sauce workshop to prevent fraud.</p>
<h3>Scholarship Donation</h3>
<p>From November 18th to 24th, this newspaper received scholarships totaling 100 yuan from Fengyao Company (compensation for Jin's employees), 50 yuan from Liao Rushan, 28 yuan and 2 jiao from the Jing'an Temple Road branch of Jiuan Bank, 20 yuan from Huang Guoli, 10 yuan from Qian Shenji, and 5 yuan from Zhu Jianyu, totaling 213 yuan and 2 jiao in Central Reserve Certificates. In addition, 100 yuan was received from Accountant Li Ding for Yao's mother's funeral (Yao's mother's funeral, including the previous amount, totaled 19,335 yuan). The two totals are 313 yuan and 2 jiao in Central Reserve Certificates. The previous deposit was 100,252 yuan, 9 jiao, and 2 fen. The total deposit is 100,566 yuan, 1 jiao, and 2 fen.</p>
<p>Industrial and commercial circles' movements</p>
<h3>Shanghai Business Pioneers: New Asia Construction Co., Ltd.</h3>
<p>In today's Shanghai business environment where idle funds are being widely used for investment, New Asia Construction Co., Ltd. has already opened on December 1st. Praises for the company from various sectors have been detailed in various newspapers; this newspaper need not reiterate them. However, what outstanding qualities does this pioneer in Shanghai's business community possess? Let us, who are concerned with Shanghai's industrial and commercial dynamics, further introduce it to the public in this newspaper.</p>
<p>(1) The Founding Position and Process of New Asia Construction:</p>
<p>In modern countries, investment in industry and commerce generally falls into two categories: first, direct investment, which involves purchasing shares of a company as a pure investment; second, indirect investment, which involves pooling resources from various individuals to establish an organization whose business is investment. This organization then utilizes its capital according to the needs of the industrial and commercial sectors, either by starting new businesses or by supporting existing ones to promote their development, thereby indirectly obtaining profits. The convergence of these two approaches and the resulting economic prosperity are inevitable. The latter, in particular, leverages collective capital and expert perspectives to cultivate numerous industrial and commercial enterprises, while the investors themselves enjoy stable and substantial benefits. The investment scope of such organizations, which engage in indirect investment, is far broader than that of direct investment, and its security is therefore greater than that of simple investment. Consequently, the development of its business is naturally assured. Cognizant of this, prominent figures in Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles raised 10 million yuan in national currency to establish New Asia Construction Co., Ltd., specializing in legitimate and safe investments. Initially, the focus is on New Asia's various factories. Once considerable success has been achieved, the remaining resources will be extended to other productive enterprises beyond the New Asia scope. It appears that the targets of New Asia Construction Co., Ltd. have been predetermined and are all businesses with well-established foundations. On one hand, it leverages existing advantages; on the other hand, it develops opportunities as they arise. Such a position can be considered foolproof, and the results are sure to be twice as effective with half the effort.</p>
<p>The company's founding process is also worth a brief description. Since Xu Guanqun, Zhu Boquan, Zhao Rutiao, Xu Baohua, Gu Kemin, Li Bohan, Qiu Liangrong, Shi Ziquan, Cheng Muyuan, Cao Chouyu, Shi Zuomou, Yu Daosun, and others—all of whom have been involved in founding New Asia enterprises for many years—initiated the project, the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory at 1095 Xin Zha Road was used as the preparatory office. After active preparations, in addition to the promoters subscribing to 8 million yuan of shares, the remaining 2 million yuan were fully subscribed by the shareholders of various factories within the New Asia scope. By the end of the subscription period, the subscribed capital had reached as much as 50 million yuan. As a result, the number of shares subscribed by each subscriber had to be proportionally reduced, and the excess funds paid were refunded accordingly.</p>
<p>(2) Current and Future Investment Targets of New Asia Construction:</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, New Asia Construction Co., Ltd. initially focuses on New Asia's various factories. The scope of New Asia's factories includes New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory, New Asia Hygiene Material Factory, New Asia Serum Factory, New Asia Scientific Company, New Asia Enzyme Industry Factory, and Xianggang New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory, among other organizations. The capital turnover of all New Asia factories, apart from their own capital, has historically relied on the continuous investment of founders and shareholders. Over the past twenty years, the business has thrived. In recent years, New Asia's pharmaceutical products have increasingly replaced imported European and American drugs. Now, with a financially strong investment organization as its backing, it is conceivable that its scope will continue to expand and its scale will become increasingly grand. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Special Alert for Both Settlement Volunteer Corps, Preparing for Air Defense Drills</h3>
<p>District captains and members of the self-defense corps of the Public Settlement were specially ordered yesterday to hold a special alert on the 7th, 8th, and 9th. In addition to adding posts on important roads, other self-defense corps members must be fully equipped and ready for action. Members of the French Concession's civilian police corps will also be fully deployed today and tomorrow to maintain order. In addition, the Public Settlement's district captains have received notices from the authorities that air defense drills may be held at any time in the future, so they should intensify preparations beforehand to avoid being caught unprepared. Upon receiving orders, district captains will post notices to inform the people. All air defense equipment must be carefully inspected, otherwise there is a risk of punishment if any deficiencies are found during the drills.</p>

The association has established advisory and research departments and is actively promoting its work.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Gold Ornaments Listed at 3,250 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Dashin Tongxing Jewelry Store of the city's silverware industry initially listed the selling price of gold ornaments at 3,150 yuan per tael without any change. At 10:20 AM, it suddenly increased by 100 yuan to 3,250 yuan. (The buying price was reduced by varying amounts from 100 to 200 yuan). There was no formal market price among peers. Some sought to buy everywhere, pushing up the price secretly. Even at 3,250 yuan, it was difficult to obtain. This was 120 yuan higher than last Saturday. Transactions were rare. Silver ornaments were still listed at 16 yuan per tael. The inter-dealer price had already exceeded the listed price, reaching 17 yuan.</p>
<p>The interbank lending rate of the Money Industry Association remained at 1.4 cents. Given the recent cash crunch, it remained tight.</p>
<p>The Japanese military scrip remained stagnant. The inter-dealer price was 5.5535 yuan. The retail buying and selling price at silver shops and small money houses was 5.55 and 5.56 yuan.</p>
<h3>Bank Transfers Require Joint Signatures</h3>
<p>The preparatory committee of the city's Banking Association, to strengthen security procedures, has stipulated that henceforth, checks (i.e., transfer slips) and transfer applications issued by member banks must be jointly signed and sealed by two employees. Existing seals used by various banks, except for those already requiring two signatures, should be changed according to the above regulations.</p>
<h3>Escalating Rise in Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>In the Chinese stock market, prices have risen steadily over the past ten days. Yesterday, the upward trend intensified. Public utility stocks were nowhere to be found for sale. In extremely few transactions, higher bid prices were seen on the blackboards. Zhabei Water and Electricity was bid up to 67.5 yuan, up 4.5 yuan from last Friday. China Merchants Steam Navigation reached 47.5 yuan, an all-time high, also up 4 yuan. The buying frenzy for Great China Matches was also intense, soaring to 335 yuan, up 8 yuan. Nanyang Tobacco rose 9 yuan to 131 yuan, also an unprecedented high. The upward trend has also expanded to department stores. New World rose 8.5 yuan, Wing On rose 4 yuan. The National Products Company was trading ex-rights, rising from 85 yuan to 90 yuan. Underwear rose 2 yuan. Wing On Textiles once reached a high of 2,035 yuan, then fell back to 1,978 yuan, still up 55 yuan. Among the small denomination textile stocks, only Xinfeng Dyeing and Printing recovered to the 20 yuan mark. Great China Manufacturing was at 10.75 yuan, Guangming Weaving at 11.5 yuan, both slightly up. Most of the others were traded sparsely and prices were flat. China Book Company in the cultural sector also traded ex-rights at 200 yuan. Commercial Press rose 10 yuan. World Book Company was down slightly by 2.5 yuan. New pharmaceutical stocks rose again and again. New Asia made a new high of 66.75 yuan from 63.5 yuan, later falling 1 yuan, still up 2.25 yuan. Minyi rose 2.5 yuan. Sino-French Company has changed to 1 yuan denomination storage certificates, increasing capital by giving two new shares for each old share, with a premium subscription of one share to get a total of five new shares. It rose from 29.5 yuan to 32.5 yuan, finally at 30 yuan, with a sharp increase. Old shares plus one yuan were still traded as usual. Five Continents has risen to the 500 yuan mark, with the most transactions. The market price list is as follows:</p>
<h3>Thriving Inter-Dealer Cloth Business</h3>
<p>Due to the rise in gold prices, the selling price of factory cloth has been above the maximum price for several consecutive days. Therefore, the inter-dealer business in this street has become thriving. At the same time, there has been an improvement in actual sales, revitalizing the sluggish market. White cotton and fine cloth rose by 3 to 4 yuan per piece throughout the day. 16-pound Earth brand coarse cloth was at 255 yuan, Flying Goose at 250 yuan, 14-pound Earth brand at 225 yuan, 12-pound Earth brand fine cloth was at 190 yuan in the morning, and 192 yuan later in the day. Great Peng and Fugui also required 191 yuan. The rise in colored cloth was even stronger. Peach Blossom Lady brand rose to 316 yuan, Chick Factory brand single color at 310 yuan, Longevity silk at 8.2 yuan, Volleyball yarn silk at 6.6 yuan, and Three Sheep Serge at 6.95 yuan, all extremely firm.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth was also tight. Because there was not much stock available, the price gradually rose. The closing price of new orders for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 195 yuan, bank orders at 197 yuan, Rainbow Ball at 196.5 yuan, Flying Fish at 194.5 yuan, Yang He at 194 yuan, and Trumpet at 193.5 yuan. Four Gentlemen Serge started at 7.85 yuan for red orders, rising to 7.89 yuan, a sharp increase of 1.1 cents per yard.</p>
<h3>Commercial Briefs</h3>
<p>Longan prices have relaxed again. There has been a relatively large number of arrivals, with several hundred boxes being released successively, with price fluctuations reaching 100 to 200 yuan. Yesterday, the market released another 700 boxes, with prices 200 yuan lower than the highest price, causing market chaos. However, subsequent arrivals are temporarily lacking, so the market is relatively stable.</p>
<p>Dried shrimp and squid have tightened again. There have been few shipments of dried shrimp from Shantou recently, so the market is slightly tighter. The market price is 5,100 to 5,200 yuan, with lower prices for inferior goods. Dried squid from Shantou has also recovered slightly, selling for 3,200 to 3,300 yuan. There is a shortage of Xiangguan goods, with market prices requiring 3,550 yuan. The market trend is firm.</p>
<p>Dried tangerine peels are in stalemate. The best dried tangerine peels are from Sichuan and Guangdong, followed by Wenzhou. Recently, some goods have been transferred from Wenzhou. Although the market is short of stock, dealers are not greedy due to the tight monetary situation. Therefore, the seller's asking price is too high and there are no buyers, and the difference in prices is several hundred yuan, so no transactions have been made.</p>
<p>There is a slight shortage of sugar. According to the Cooperative Office, a large batch of sugar will arrive soon, but it may not be Philippine sugar and will be transferred from somewhere else. Therefore, Shanghai will not have a shortage of sugar. The retail dealers have requested an additional allocation for this month, and it is said that an additional 5,000 bags have been approved.</p>
<p>New iron wire trading is sluggish. Although the stock of 16 to 25 gauge wire in Shanghai is already depleted, sales are still difficult to achieve. However, yesterday the market saw activity from factory users, with sporadic transactions, but the market remained flat.

<h3>The Great East Asia War Over the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>The Great East Asia War, a full year has passed!</p>
<p>A year, this is a year of unprecedented change in East Asian history!</p>
<p>A year, this is a year of unprecedented shock in world history!</p>
<p>During this year, the colonial policies of British and American imperialism in the Pacific ended, the forces of British and American imperialism and their imperialist policies of squeezing and exploiting Asian nations ended, and their violence in Asia was driven out and eliminated like boiling soup poured on snow!</p>
<p>During this year, the countries and nations of Asia saw how Japanese soldiers, continuing after the Russo-Japanese War, in just a few months, expelled the British and American imperialist forces that had occupied the Pacific for more than a hundred years. The countries and nations of Asia began to see a new situation in the Pacific that their ancestors could not have dreamed of! The nations of Asia, nations that had always been invaded and despised, now began to be masters of Asia and masters of the Pacific themselves!</p>
<p>A new history has unfolded! The new situation shocked every Asian and person in the world!</p>
<p>What is the main driving force behind this great change that divides historical eras? The Great East Asia War!</p>
<p>1.  General Situation Before the War</p>
<p>What was the situation in the Pacific on the eve of the Great East Asia War?</p>
<p>First, the two largest countries in the Pacific—China and Japan—although there had been a glimmer of peace for two years, the unfortunate and painful war was still going on! In other words, this war had become the theme of the East Asian situation, and had become a good opportunity for British and American imperialists to exploit and profit from!</p>
<p>Second, the situation of Japan, which regarded itself as the stable force in the Pacific—the master of peace in East Asia—had reached an unprecedentedly critical moment. Anti-Japanese forces, led by British and American imperialists, began to implement a step-by-step blockade against Japan—from economic blockade to the so-called ABCD line of military blockade. Especially after the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, Britain and the United States could breathe a sigh of relief in the West, so their policy toward Japan—the oppression of Japan—became more active. At that time, if Japan was slightly careless, it would cause unimaginable consequences.</p>
<p>Third, although the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy had been established, the three countries were divided, each facing its own enemies, and could not further closely coordinate and assist each other. Germany and Italy's operations could not directly help Japan, especially after the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, which instead gave Britain and the United States the opportunity to increase pressure on Japan; similarly, Japan's power could not provide much help to Germany and Italy, especially because of the treaty, Japan had to remain neutral during the German-Soviet war, and there was no other way to assist its German and Italian allies.</p>
<p>From Japan's standpoint before the Great East Asia War, the international situation was unfavorable, and this unfavorable situation was still developing. However, the British and American policy of blockading Japan was two-sided. On the one hand, they took advantage of the gap in the German-Soviet war and adopted a "proactive Far East policy" to intensify the blockade against Japan, with lightning and thunder, like a heavy rain about to fall. But on the other hand, figures such as the American ambassador to Japan, Grew, and especially the British ambassador to Japan, Craigie, continued to pursue a "policy of appeasement" toward Japan in a pro-Japanese manner. This intention was, of course, still to attempt to ease Japan's war preparations, and to preserve their position in the Pacific under the slogan of "maintaining the status quo in the Far East." However, this policy of "appeasement" and "blockade" being carried out in parallel also exposed the internal contradictions and weakness of war capabilities within Britain and the United States. Therefore, Japan took advantage of this gap and launched a diplomatic offensive against Britain and the United States. The visits to the United States by Nomura and Kurusu were essentially hoping for the realization of genuine peace, but Japan was not without foresight about the outcome of diplomatic failure.</p>
<p>However, the international situation in the months after the German-Soviet war became increasingly serious! Especially after the start of winter operations, although the German army had already besieged Moscow, it finally shifted from offensive to defensive consolidation due to the severe cold. Taking advantage of this situation, British and American imperialism attempted to use the winter to strengthen the pressure on Japan. But they did not expect, nor did they ever dream, that during this period, Japan had completed all the necessary war preparations and bravely launched the unprecedented Great East Asia War, not hesitating to fight Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>2.  Victorious War History and Its Significance</p>
<p>On December 8th, the imperial rescript declaring war on Britain and the United States was issued!</p>
<p>At 6:00 a.m. on the 8th, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters Army and Navy Department announced: "The Imperial Army and Navy have entered a state of war with the British and American forces in the Western Pacific"!</p>
<p>(1) The Naval Battle of Hawaii</p>
<p>Hawaii is about 3,100 nautical miles from Japan and is an important base for the US Navy's trans-Pacific offensive against Japan. The United States built the Pearl Harbor naval port, investing a huge sum of 100 million US dollars, and together with Gibraltar in the Mediterranean, it is one of the world's two major naval ports. The US Navy uses Hawaii as its apex, and Alaska's Ketchikan and Panama constitute a triangle as a Pacific defense line, a lifeline that does not allow other countries to invade, and the Japanese Navy was the first to break through this world-famous American lifeline! At 8:45 p.m. on the first day, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters announced the world-shaking battle results.</p>
<p>According to the detailed report of the Battle of Hawaii published by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters on December 18, the US Navy in this area has been completely destroyed. The main battle results are: (1) Sunk five battleships, two Class A cruisers, and two destroyers. (2) Severely damaged three battleships, two light cruisers, and two destroyers. (3) Slightly damaged one battleship and four Class B cruisers. (4) Damage to land and sea air force: 50 aircraft, 14 shot down. In addition, a Japanese submarine sank a battleship, and the Japanese side lost 29 aircraft and five special submarines that did not return.</p>
<p>Combining the results of this air and sea war in Hawaii, Japan used blitzkrieg tactics in a very short period, unexpectedly, and reaped unexpected results. It made the largest base for the United States to attack Japan in the Pacific lose its function, and made the threat of the United States to the Japanese mainland lose its possibility. In the history of the Great East Asia War, the victory of the Pearl Harbor surprise attack is considered the first page of the new history of East Asia.</p>
<p>(2) Eliminating British and American Troops Stationed in China</p>
<p>One of the important tools for British and American imperialism to maintain its rule in the Pacific colonies, and a national shame in modern Chinese history, was the stationing of British and American troops in China, but this humiliating history finally ended with the Great East Asia War that began on December 8.</p>
<p>At 11:00 a.m. on the 8th, Japanese Shanghai Marine Corps troops entered the Public Concession south of the Suzhou River. The armaments of the US Marines in Beijing, Tianjin, and Qinhuangdao were also disarmed on the same day. In Guangzhou, Japanese troops also entered the Shamian British Concession on the same day.</p>
<p>(3) Japanese Troops Enter Thailand</p>
<p>Before the Great East Asia War, the relationship between Japan and Thailand was known to be friendly. However, on the eve of the war, Britain and the United States stepped up their activities in Thailand, hoping to make Thailand a link in the blockade against Japan, so when the Great East Asia War broke out, Japan suddenly entered Thailand and obtained a base for attacking Malaya with Vietnam; it also isolated the land transportation links between Malaya and Burma, and threatened the Yunnan-Burma Road.</p>
<p>On the 11th, the Thai government announced the Japan-Thailand alliance of offense and defense. At that time, British aircraft indiscriminately bombed Thailand. On January 25 of this year, the Thai government officially declared war on Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Japan found a friend in Thailand at the beginning of the Great East Asia War. From the perspective of its geographical environment, political relations, and military strength, it gave Japan a strong base for its southern strategy and political strategy. At the same time, it cut off the connection between Britain and the United States and the Chongqing government, and Burma and India began to be threatened.</p>
<p>(4) Naval Battle of Malaya</p>
<p>Within three days of the start of the war, the Japanese naval air force searched for the main force of the British Far East Fleet off the east coast of the Malay Peninsula, bombed and sank the battleship Prince of Wales and the UK's most famous flagship, HMS Repulse, destroying the main force of the British Far East Fleet.</p>
<p>After the victory in the Battle of Malaya, like the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, it shook the general staff of Britain and the United States, causing dissatisfaction among the people of Britain and the United States with their governments, and forcing Britain and the United States to reorganize their air and naval forces and command system in Asia. Therefore, it was naturally impossible to carry out a second front in Europe.</p>
<p>(5) Destruction of the Central Pacific Invasion Route</p>
<p>At the beginning of the war, the Japanese army strongly attacked the three major military bases of Britain and the United States, such as Hawaii, Manila, and Singapore, and destroyed their main fleet in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>In the first week of the war, the United States' route for invading Japan in the central Pacific was thoroughly destroyed, as the Japanese Navy Minister Shimada reported to the 78th Extraordinary Diet on December 16, "The functions of all strategic and important transportation locations from Hawaii to East Asia have been destroyed."</p>
<p>Hawaii—Guam—Manila—Singapore—this remotely connected line was a line of encirclement given by Britain and the United States that posed a major threat to the Japanese mainland. In the past, the United States relied on its traditional naval policy, relying on its fleet and bases—the so-called two major elements of the navy—and spared no expense in completing the "Maginot Line in the Pacific," which not only the US General Staff was proud of, but also Britain had great expectations for, believing that once Japan and the United States went to war, if Britain and the United States cooperated, Japan would be easily defeated. But the reality was contrary to the ideal. This large encirclement, blockade, and attack line against Japan could not withstand a single blow from the Japanese navy and air force and completely collapsed.</p>
<p>(6) Occupation of Hong Kong</p>
<p>Britain had occupied Hong Kong for a full hundred years, which British imperialists had painstakingly managed as a major base for aggression against China. After the Japanese army occupied Guangzhou, Hong Kong became a key point of contact between Britain and the Chongqing government.</p>
<p>On the 8th, the Japanese army flying squadron in southern China launched a surprise attack on the Kowloon airfield in the early morning, inflicting heavy damage. On the army side, as early as before dawn, they broke through the border, and on the night of the 9th, they had already attacked the defense line on the back of Kowloon.</p>
<p>On the 12th, they advanced to Kowloon, cleared out the British army, and immediately prepared to attack Hong Kong. At dawn on the 14th, they began a general offensive against Hong Kong. On the night of the 18th, Japanese troops landed on the eastern and western parts of the Hong Kong fortress. By the 20th, the western half of Hong Kong had fallen into the hands of the Japanese army. By 5:50 p.m. on the 25th, the Governor of Hong Kong requested a ceasefire and surrendered unconditionally. On the 26th, Japanese troops formally entered Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, which had been ruled by the British Empire for a hundred years, Hong Kong, which had been painstakingly managed by the British Empire for aggression against China, raised the flag of the Japanese Empire on the hundredth anniversary of Hong Kong's fall. This was the first loss of territory for the British Empire since the European War.</p>
