<h3>邱吉爾突抵華盛頓　再度會唔羅斯福　討論有關作戰各項問題英總參謀勃魯克等隨行</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城十九日同盟社電　據華盛頓消息、白宮秘書歐萊昨日午後向報界宜佈、英國首相邱吉爾已於昨日到達白宮、並定於今晚與羅斯福總統舉行首次會議、按自美國參戰以來、邱吉爾首相於半年中訪美者、此爲第二次、此次同來者尙有英國陸軍參謀長勃魯克將軍及英美參謀團秘書伊斯梅少將等要人、邱吉爾首相此行、與上次同樣秘密、所談內容或與歐陸方面開關第二戰塲有關、</p>
<p>華盛頓十八日哈瓦斯電　英國首相邱吉爾、已於十八日抵此、即當訪晤羅斯福總統、會商有關作戰之各項問題、聞此二政治家、定於當晚（上海夏令時間十九日午後二時）、在白宮舉行第一次會議、英國空軍參謀長勃魯克將軍與英國海陸空三軍參謀長聯席會議秘書長伊斯梅少將均隨之同來、</p>
<p>倫敦十九日哈瓦斯社電　邱吉爾首相此次赴美、事前嚴守秘密溯自戰事發生以還、邱吉爾出國與羅斯福總統舉行會議、此係第三次、至於與首相同行之勃魯克上將、現年五十八歲、於一九四一年十一月起就任參謀長、</p>
<p>瑞典京城十九日海通社電　邱吉爾首相　次聘美之消息傳出後、華盛頓人士莫不感覺極大之興趣、有以此訊問衆議院海軍委員會主席文生者　答稱、羅期福將與邱氏討論十分重要之問題、關於開關第二戰塲之可能、或將討論及之、觀察敏銳之人士指陳、邱氏聘美之訊、可轉移一般軍人之視綫、外界對里比亞戰事之變化、與英當局之新聞政策紛紛評論今聞邱氏聘美、談鋒當爲之轉移、倫敦發來之文吿、祇謂首相偕英國總參謀長勃魯克爵士抵達華盛頓、但美國消息則謂邱氏即將與羅斯福進行談判、</p>

<p>里比亞邊境某地十八日哈瓦斯社電　頃據前綫最後消息、軸心國軍隊在里比亞前綫漸佔優勢、</p>
<h3>七·利比亞一瞥</h3>
<p>利比亞（Libya）在非洲北部，埃及之西，隔地中海和義大利相望，所以這片片沙漠地一向是義國的禁　。這幾天電訊所傳，利比亞的戰事非常劇烈，德義聯軍和英軍各以坦克車互相衝鋒。據說雙方都已呈筋疲力竭之勢。哈瓦斯社瑞士京城的電訊中，有句頗堪玩味的話，「……同時柏林方面對於利比亞戰局前途，表示樂，但出以緘默。」在一百度以上的酷暑中，雙方只能　用坦克來術鋒陷陣，本來是難取決於一時的。軸心軍如能在北非對於近東諸國的威　，英軍在一此死力鬥爭，多少含有一點牽掣作用，使蘇境內的戰事有曠日持久之勢。利比亞戰局截止記者屬稿時尙未吿一段落，但一共為世界人士所矚目，推測這塊沙漠地帶未來的運命，想必大有人在，見仁見智，記者不一便在此妄加論斷，讓事實米　明　者諸君的觀測是怎樣吧。利比亞在行政上，分為的黎波里（Tripolitania）和昔蘭尼加（Oyrenaiea）二部。前者的首府即名的黎波里，後者的首府名班加席（Bengusi）各有總督駐紮。總面積四十二萬餘方哩，人口約七十七萬。沙漠中間有豐沃的泉地，里比亞的農田都賴以液溉。</p>
<p>班加席在昔蘭尼加西北，　　　　（Gul　fof　Sidra）之　，傍地中海岸。濱海多高　　廈。三十年來經義人不斷經　，市區儘量擴展，已較　來城市　大三倍有奇。市中街道寬廣，建築新穎，在舊時亞拉伯區旁邊，闢爲公園，供市內人民游憇之用。此外有一新式競技塲，每年九月下旬，舉行各種運動比賽如賽馬，賽球，競走等。現在北非烽火緊張，班加席成爲義大利運輸軍隊和給養的要衝。四鄉土地極爲肥沃，果園，葡萄園，豆地等隨處可見，每年產量極豐。</p>
<p>昔蘭尼加一帶海岸雨量豐沛，已够農業所需，不必再行灌溉。五年中有一年大早，義國工程師爲補救此缺憾起見，設法在當地聞　自流井或發掘泉源，以防萬一。在利比亞海岸的公路上往東駕車馳行，只見農村三三兩兩，都是新近在此卜居的異鄕人。原來這是美國的殖民計劃，預備到本年爲止，把八萬家農民殖民到利比亞去。每家至少要有八人，務須是農業出身，身體健康，識字，是法西斯黨員，品性優良。每村的組織完全一致，其中包　敎堂，學校，運動塲，藥房，議事廳，和黨部。農田的各項設備，都由當局供應，如房屋，豬圈，穀倉，種子，農具，機械和其她用具等，但拋離家鄕往利比亞去的人應有拓荒者的精神和勇氣。羅馬帝國的倉糜就是這樣里建起來！</p>
<p>蘭尼加的尖端—昔蘭尼城（Oirene）。此地山問的泉源旁，有古代浴池。故義國總督曾經修建浴池，以爲私用。且在山上　有別　，居高臨下，古今雄偉的景色，一覽無遺。這是希臘人在海外建立的最偉大的城市，現在只見破碎的彫像，　榭牆　的遺跡，都是一堆瓦礫了。城的北郊，還留　無數古代的墳幕。紀元前第七世紀，希臘人流亡到此地來，建造昔蘭尼城，熙攘繁盛，歷七百年不衰。在全盛時代此地的居民　說有十萬人之多。</p>
<p>有一件事可以證明昔蘭尼城的繁盛。曾經在廢墟中發掘到的一塊硬石上，有一段記載。在紀元前三三一年至三二三年間，希臘國內大饑，昔蘭尼城共運出五穀二萬九千噸，以爲救濟祖國饑荒之用。</p>
<p>離昔蘭尼城不到十哩，有一商港名阿波羅尼亞（Apollonia），常時沿地中海岸的遠近國家如希臘，敘利亞，埃及三角洲市鎭等都要遣船駛抵阿波羅尼亞來貿易。</p>
<p>倡導以快樂爲人生無上目的的哲學家亞列斯的保氏（Aristippus），無神論者齊　杜勒斯（Theodorus），最先決定子午錢長度地地理學家埃拉托色尼（Eratosthenes）詩人加麗馬　斯人（Callimachus）等都在昔　尼住過。</p>
<p>希臘人失勢後，昔　尼即落人埃及人帶領，於是再給羅馬所佔有。紀元後一一五年間，此地的猶太居民大殺羅馬人和里比亞人，對於興盛的昔　尼城，受到絕大的打擊。四世紀後，又有土著蠻族的侵犯，地震的損毀城市遂逐漸　衰落。自昔蘭尼沿海岸東行，沿路只見阡陌縱橫，都是農業區域。杜那（Derna）古稱肥沃，因有山泉灌溉，現在仍很豐沃。杜那的水源充沛，對於義軍戰略方面，極關重要。杜那托東的沿海岸城市泰勃勒區（Tobruch）缺乏新鮮淡水，即用裝置水槽的船獲，自杜那運來。昔蘭尼加沿海岸只有杜那和班加席兩地有新鮮淡水，可以供給當地之用。</p>
<p>沿了古羅馬帝國曾經有過兵車絡繹的道路前進，就到泰勃勒區。此去一百十哩，沃　的田地逐漸改少，接著看到是一片沙漠。英國海空軍前年會在此轟炸過，以阻義軍的前進。港口附近義國設有海軍根據地，陸軍兵營。此地海灣，由一座半島向東灣入海中形成，海港長二哩，　一哩不到，終年不凍，大兵艦可以自由進出，要算比非最佳的軍港。翻聞非洲地圖來看，利比亞的區域不能算不大，比美國本部至少大五倍半，可憐其聞能够適宜　植的土地只有極少極少的一部份。除了昔蘭尼加的沿海地中海岸一帶，以及的黎波里若干區域外，地圖上可能找到的地名僅是表明該地駐有小隊哨兵，或是有幾所泥屋，沙漠中的沃土，或僅是該處有水源，如此而已。其餘的地面，不是多砂石，就是浩浩無果的一片黃沙，悶熱的氣候，數日　中找不到一縷人烟英方承認德軍對杜白魯克港之威脅有增無减、而羅美爾將軍之部隊、不久日將與此要塞之第一一道防綫發生接觸、在事實上杜白魯克港已被軸心國軍隊包圍、唯一退路僅能沿海岸向東退却、一英國輕捷部隊刻正在該港西南兩面、擾亂德義鐵甲車隊、俾收牽掣之效、使其不能直接進攻該港、李奇將軍似已下絕大決心、不惜任何代價、保衛此一要塞、惟根據最後消息、事實上英軍總司令部因遭遇軸心國軍隊之强大壓力、除將軍隊撤至杜白魯克港後面俾在該港與埃及邊界之間佈置新陣地從而　續抵抗外、別無他途可循矣、此在亞克洛瑪區迄無確切消息僅知英軍已放棄原來陣地、而向杜白魯克港作大規模之撤退、準此而論、英軍自此二據點、即亞克洛瑪與埃爾亞丹撤退之後、現僅扼守杜白魯克要塞而已、且昨今兩日之間、軸心國軍隊聞已集中於埃爾亞丹區、並有大批生力軍及軍用品源源運到、準備向東大舉進攻、羅美爾將軍之目的、顯在使杜白魯克港陷於孤立、務使該港英軍不能他調、參加未來攻勢、德軍即可乘機向東進攻、是以羅美爾將軍對於杜白魯克港之爭奪，認爲非常重要、</p>
<h3>德方戰報</h3>
<p>柏林十九日海通社電　德軍司令部昨夜第一次發表里比亞戰爭之詳細情形稱、軸心國軍隊現已突入地中海沿岸、重向杜白魯克方面推進、英軍被吾包圍者數甚衆、自佔領皮爾哈根後（軸心國軍軍隊即自南面挺進、襲擊加薩拉方面英軍之側翼、並在杜白魯克拖西與英軍發生接觸、六月十四日在亞克羅馬　發生激戰、催毀敵軍鐵甲車甚夥、故德義聯軍現已能向海岸方面推進、其後在亞克波瑪殲滅南非軍一旅、另有英軍與南非軍各一師受重創、加薩拉方面戰事亦殊激烈、軸心軍計在該處佔領十千四百方公里、德空軍協助陸軍向北面與東面推進、頗著成效、炸毀敵軍坦克車與其他車輛甚夥、最近四日內德機共擊落英機五十四架云、</p>

<h3>法租界一部分當鋪　昨已受當復業將呈請法總領署修改條文</h3>
<p>法租界典當及押舖一百八十餘家自前日爲法領署管理條文而止當候贖後、即經典當公會及押典公所勸導、因之昨日已有一部分受當復業、至於典業公會及押典公所、則現正在集合商討中、冀圖擬具意見、呈提法租界當局、要求修改章程、以維營業、茲據大通社記者向該業公會及公所、探悉意見如后、</p>
<p>典業意見</p>
<p>典業公會　見以為此次法領署條文、確多無法奉行之處、同業之相率止當、殊出萬不得已、但止當後勢必影響平民周轉之急、足使社會情形趨於不安、故竭力勸導同業照舊例暫行受當、但在署令未修正前、仍照舊例受當、頗多有觸法之　、故除　手就署令難行各條詳註意見、准備提請修正外、並擬先行以書面向法租界當局據實聲明、以使同業得以　安譽業、又謂　觀新署令各條、知其用意、無非偏重於杜編竊盜臟物之受當、但實際上就過去數個月調査、知法租界典當十八家、吊贓事件、異常稀少、且主管官署原定上海市典當營業規、對於典當收當臟物、曾有專條規定、典當除該規　第十條、　公家物品有織證可辨者、　珍奇玩物不能確定共價格者，應予拒當外、其他物品、本祗認物不認人、概行受當、今新署令之規定、對於典主及經理之約束、實過於嚴厲、使營業範圖縮小外、更有動輙觸犯法規之虞、故同業等對於新署令之規定、非有所修正外、實無法敢繼續營業云、</p>
<h3>騎自由車不愼　致釀人命</h3>
<p>法大馬路一九八號大豐洋雜貨號學徒靑年湖北人吳長安、今年十九歲、於十六日下午二時乘脚踏車出外、行經霞飛路維爾蒙路口時、有住南市肇嘉路蘭發里八號紹興婦人趙戴氏、三十一歲、懷抱其生甫十個月之幼子名月良、由維爾蒙路向北越過霞飛路時、吳車經過、不及避讓、將趙戴氏撞倒、小孩亦跌出數尺受傷甚重、由捕到來、將兩造帶入捕房後、傷孩轉送廣慈醫院救治無效、於前日斃命、由捕房將孩屍送往騐屍所、由屬於昨日領殮、一面由屍屬向肇事之吳長安提出交涉、要求賠償五千元、捕房亦以吳有過失殺人罪嫌、予以法辦、</p>
<h3>麻瘋病的傳染　丁福保</h3>
<p>麻瘋病是一種傳染病　人都知道，牠與肺癆一樣，由於一種病菌散佈的緣故。但從形式上講，肺癆却不若麻瘋的外露，因爲麻瘋至相當時期，使皮　手指面目等，會變成可怖的形像，叫人家見而生畏，避之若俛。然據近麻瘋專家研究，承認其傳染性不若一般人所想像容易，麻瘋院中的醫生職員爲證，他們　日與患者接近，却未嘗被其傳染。顧此並不是否定麻瘋的傳染性，乃是要我們知道麻瘋的傳染，是有生活上與防禦上的條件。</p>
<p>試舉英國爲例罷在中世紀時，亦會有麻瘋的流行，但至今日，幾乎已經絕跡，通很明顯地知道由於他們生活改進的緣故。他們從前所居的潮濕木星，如今都由水泥磚石造成，空氣流　，光　充足，自來水可以供人民沐浴洗滌之便：尤其注意食品的營養，人體上各種需要得有充分的供給，以抵制其病菌的生殖，有了這樣合理的衛生，自能養成健康的體魄，麻瘋病菌便失去了傳染的媒介，自然而然地漸漸消滅了。反觀找國則如何？一般生活，恰與相反，汗濁·黑暗·潮濕·的居處，與不良營養，宜其傳染之易而愈演愈廣了。七述的醫生職員，他們　有消毒殺菌的防潔衛生，又有健康的抵抗力，病毒便不易　人了。</p>
<p>出前者　，我們　注意患者時生活、由　者　，我們應注意防　的衛生。中　麻瘋救濟會的創立，無非本此立塲因　分設療養院診療所，商以蛟新　明的藥品爲之治療，一面收容患者以改善其生活。但在目前中國，患麻瘋病者竟在、百萬人之多，而一得收容過五萬人，杯水車薪，距撲滅此病的目的尙速非有巨額的經費，大規模的收容，不足以觀厥成功。果能羣策羣力，予以充分的經濟援助，滅此大患非不可能，熱心社會人土，於此次該會募捐運動中慷慨捐叻，將使一般針會，不致有轉染之　。則幸甚矣。</p>
<h3>工部局為隬補臨時支出　發行公債五百萬元　照票面價値九二·五發行</h3>

<h3>閨閣千金摩登裝飾品　女式闊邊草帽　足以增加美貌平添豐韻出門冠帶古時男女一律</h3>
<p>兒時的回憶</p>
<p>連日梅雨綿綿，把大地洗成另一番景象，身上却又悶熱難受，等到放晴後又是驕陽逼人，眞如熱鍋上螞蟻，走頭無路了。近來自行車盛行，騎車踏靑的更是不少，祗是烈日當頭，晒得頭暈面紅，汗水淋淋；風大時又吹得披頭散髮，如喪考妣。把費了一小時多修飾得好好的面貌，滿想風光一下的，却弄得像個活鬼，於是，聰明的商人，就想到那頂闊邊的草帽是應時的妙品了。回憶在兒童時代，每屆夏節，我的父親買新草帽時必另爲我買一頂小草帽，那冒　上飄飄的藍帶，至今還使我十分神往，那時是很够我風光的，在小朋友間十分炫耀，他們伸　小手，撫摩着帽頂，睜着圓圓的眼睛，裹面的黑球，骨溜溜地十分眼紅，站在公園　的鞦輕架上一來一往，藍帶一飛一揚，是多麼地得意呀！光陰隨日月過去，我長成十多歲的時候，看看別人都不戴草帽，自己也覺得不好意思戴，雖然心眼裏頗懷舊情，小小的人兒，在闊大的精子裏，騙陽無法使展它的威力，我不禁奇怪爲何中國現在的女子不帶草帽？是習俗上不能帶嗎？沒有充足的理由；是帶了不美觀？恐父適得其反，那麽爲甚麽呢？</p>
<p>新式草帽</p>
<p>假使你的面孔太長或太短，可以揀一頂草帽戴上，把他前掀後側左斜右傾，就覺得好看起來。</p>
<p>帽子和面子</p>
<p>帽子在西洋女子，除了實用外，也是增加美貌的重要裝飾品，平平的面貌帶上一頂合式的呢帽或是一頂插花的草帽，便覺得十分好看起來，有時可使臉意短一些，不像馬臉般拉長得十分難看；有時又可使臉見長一些，不像檳格餅似的怪不舒服，這全憑手段的巧妙，把帽子前掀後側左斜右偏就行了。</p>
<p>珍妮麥唐納</p>
<p>記得每次看珍妮麥唐納的歌片，總覺得她戴帽子時，臉蛋長短修勻，嫵媚美麗，而在普通的鏡頭裏，就遜色不少，瓊克勞馥「女人面孔」中演出，斜側　帽子，遮蔽那被炙傷致疤痕累累的半片臉，確是使人見了不過份厭　，所以歐美女性，對於帽子的式樣，十分重視，每每不惜鉅金，耐性地在時裝公司裏試戴帽子，有大半天的光景，還未滿意。</p>
<p>愛美的天性</p>
<p>愛美，愛面子，原是人類的木性，女子尤然，中國女子又何獨不然？歷史上的中國女子講究戴凉帽的是不普遍吧！但國內各民族的殊風異俗中，一般勞　婦女都喜歡戴凉帽，旣禦炎威，又便工作，質料與式樣各地雖不一樣，用意大致相同，不過若謂古時女子從未流行戴草帽也未見盡然，讀金人元好問詩「眼看桃李飄零畫，更揀繁枝插帽簷。」旣有帽　，又值夏令，想見是草帽一類的凉帽了。又可見古時女子亦有戴凉帽插花枝爲美飾的，中國人尙以戴帽爲尙禮，男子二十行冠禮，以後出入均須戴帽，女子頭上插簪爲筓，或纏頭巾，詩經上說「總角冠兮，突而筓兮」即是。又有後代女道士名女冠子，可見她們出入一定要冠帶，苗族古來即有凉帽，有籐編，有各種軟草編，帽上都有美飾，亦有插鮮花的，三月一趕市時，紅男綠女爭妍鬥豔，戴了各式花帽子，鮮豔奪目，與今歐式女帽相仿，昔諸葛武侯征南蠻用大藤帽，全身都可遮蔽，孟獲娘子軍也都帶此種藤帽，上　桐油，戈矛難入，甚為得用，可見戴帽子不僅是歐美人的習俗，中國自古以來也有戴帽子的禮尚，貴族女子大都戴鳳冠，車上撐馬傘，平民大都戴草帽子。</p>
<p>花帶闊邊帽</p>
<p>民國以來，無分貴賤都是草帽了。也許因為從前小姐們深處　閣，對於涼帽的需要不大，故而不盛行，爲了時代的進展，女孩兒已衝出　門在社會上角逐，當騎者自行車條然地駛過街頭，若添上一頂花帶闊邊草帽，風姿嫣然，添色不少，在行路中，在游泳池傍，的飾物了。記起湘中漁文有咏凉帽七絕一首可以為證：「冠冕堂皇貴族儀，驅車戴笠逾人致；花邊凉帽便遮陽，筓女招搖行過市。」</p>
<h3>酒精廠爆炸後　喪失者已六人　爆炸原因諒係燃熱過度尚有炸傷工人八名未愈</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報、北河南路三六五弄二十六號之酒精廠、十八日發生爆炸、喪生者至今已有工人六名、實爲本年度最慘之工業肇禍、</p>
<p>未領危險執照</p>
<p>據調査後確悉、該廠違背工部局所訂管理工廠之條例、並未領有危險品執照、前傳該廠　因從茶葉中提取咖啡精致起爆炸之說、並不確實、緣瓦礫堆中雖發現提取咖啡精夕器、但已久　使用、</p>
<p>係蒸餾器爆裂</p>
<p>塲裂者、實係可容六十加侖、從高粱酒提取酒精之蒸溜器也、該器之暖氣管似已受損、而昨日工作時、熱度過髙或工作不愼、致起爆炸、轟然一聲、振耳欲　、蒸溜器炸離底座、三處牆垣被炸穿、整個廠屋　受震動、茍非消防員趕到將其支撐、則全屋或將倒塲、</p>
<p>被炸者十四人</p>
<p>當時有工人十四名、均被炸傷或磚瓦擊傷、其中十三人神志尚淸、亟逸入後衖、經救護車員救起、另一工人則已倒臥一人五名、亦於昨日午後及夜間傷重身亡、其餘工人八名、則仍留醫院治療、</p>
<p>該廠專煉茶膏</p>
<p>大通社云、昨日各報競載之汽鍋爆炸死傷十四人事件、據大通社記者向各有關方面探訪、得悉事主係源源煉茶廠、為一新開設之小規模廠、因該廠爲股份有限公司、故由本地人鄭某任經理、且該廠係新近開設、專煉製茶膏、向外埠銷售、其所備機械雖已呈准使用、但自購置後、從未開工、前日爲開工之第一日、當試機時、因工人大意、未將汽鍋溫度注意、因之由過熱而發生爆炸、受傷工人已有四人離院、因該廠股東大部不在滬、故如何撫恤、迄今　未有妥善辦法、</p>

<h3>余叔岩病狀之又一說</h3>
<p>— 梅花館主</p>
<p>尿道閉塞—無法醫治</p>
<p>久病之軀—疲憊不堪</p>
<p>自本報發表「余叔岩病為篤」之消息後，凡關心余氏之戲迷同志，皆紛紛以電話向愚探問余氏之眞實病狀，愚以久未與余氏通函，其近狀何若，實無從得悉，惟最近　平世版之「三六九畫報」，曾刊有「余叔岩病愈後，精神甚佳，其徒孟小冬時往存問」之記述，故拙作余氏小史中，因有「近已健飯如常」之語，愚為求事實準確　見，乃於昨日訪問於市自北平南歸之王大邦先生？（北平大昌西藥行經理，本月十五日扺滬，）王君旅旅已多時，　與　園行有相當往還，其所得余氏之消息，或　為詳盡而可靠也。王君之言曰：「本人離平之前，會　王瑤　譚小增二伶工，據王　所知，叔岩之疾，雖已痊愈，惟經　治　，體已疲憊不堪，且尿道早經閉塞，小便時須用橡皮管在所　之小孔內輸送，其精神上之痛苦，自可不言而喩，至於近日有無變化，則未有所即也」云云。</p>
<p>總之故岩為：久病之　，　經重　，北元氣巴衰，藥石可以治病，　不能治命，病　之說，雖未敢　為信史，然亦有可能性。容向其徒孟小冬女士詢得眞　後，再當為諸者不富君告焉。</p>
<h3>「王熙鳳」觀感</h3>
<p>— 冰澤</p>
<p>喜「紅樓夢」，尤其歡喜紅樓夢中的王熙鳳，這不　　　性的說這一個人　　人喜歡，面是歡喜作者將這一個人的性格寫得太生動，太典型化—自私，貪婪，陰險，潑辣，一方面在向舊家庭的　建制度以復仇式的心裡反抗，正因如此，一方面就成功一個封建的幫兇者，結果她徒然　牲罷了。</p>
<p>也可以這樣說：王熙鳳足以代表一般的千百年來傳統　的舊中國的女子。不一定要說曹禺的北京人」在若干地方以「紅樓夢」作藍本，至少會思　這一角，受王熙鳳的影響極深極重的，一樣的將這種　中國的女子強調　　象化起來。</p>
<p>基此，舞臺上的「王熙鳳」值得注意的。</p>
<p>王熙鳳的性格的輪廓雖已經建立者，這裡，劇作者也比較採取得體的，尤其在毒設相思局和逼死尤二姐二節，以兩種姿態寫出同樣殘酷狠毒的心，給予觀衆直覺的認議，那是作者已經　　王熙鳳的性格核心；使她使人愛，使她使人憎，不如此，就容易流入　　平凡的。</p>
<p>演出　　，　　從　足一位最擅長去表演的、影從、員，如今踏上舞臺，演技方面確够洗練，抵不過　語較弱些，否則的話，在最臨死一幕一定更有力的。吳　　則因習慣皮黃劇的緣故，與金素雯演楊娥一般，動作方面似乎不調和，而在她呑金的一段中，非常努力，深深扣住觀眾的情緒。此外，演　　的孫企英和演平兒的夏蒂，比較上有很大的成就。</p>
<p>個說來，演此　　是相當費力的，「王熙鳳」已够人滿意的了。</p>

<h3>美麗的羅塵泰楊</h3>
<p>— 嵐影</p>
<p>說結婚是婦女唯一的出路</p>
<p>羅麗泰楊是好萊塢一位最浪漫的女明星，有人這樣說，以爲她很容易和人發生戀愛，但是不能持久。她第一個所遇着的男子是葛倫惠叔，那時她才十七歲。起初的時候？兩個人的感情非常濃厚，但是沒有好久，據說是爲了一點小　情，他們分手了。過了幾年，她還會愛上一個男伶，並且和他結婚，但是不久又離婚了。以後因爲體質欠佳，有一個時期沒有獻身銀幕。一直等到拍有聲的雷夢娜，她才重進影塲工作。這時她好像長得史美了，許多男子們，捧鮮花，獻禮物，日夜地追求她，她也常和他們在一塊兒遊玩，說笑，跳舞，但是她的態度老是那樣不即不離的。這樣又過了好幾年，到了一九四○年的夏季，好萊塢才傳來了一個特殊的喜人，說：七月三十一日，美麗的洛麗泰揚，在上帝的　壇之前，已委身於湯姆羅意斯。結婚地點為惠斯何村聖保羅堂。</p>
<p>洛麗泰揚，從影十六七年，是大家熟知的大明星，演出影片達六七十部之多，差不多每部影片都有美妙的成就。這固然一部分得歸功於她的那封　脈脈，水汪汪，令人魂銷　　的媚眼，然而大部分還歸功於她個人對於化裝服飾的考究，與表演時的認眞，才使衆人會這樣的　之　。</p>
<p>洛麗泰揚　意人生的觀念是可以批許的。她說：　「我　，女　　　找　個適當的靑年男子　和他　生　愛，並且和他結婚。我相信一個女人的一生，有三分之二是消耗在她的家庭和她的丈夫　女身上的，　　是　女唯一的眞　出　。</p>
<h3>梅訊</h3>
<p>命主　　華的消息，最為般戲迷所　意，本刊亦　屢次紀載過了。昨天有　之友人某　，自港飛滬，亦談及梅氏在港，態度甚為安　，八字短髮業已修去，更　得年經貌美，他確已準備來來滬，無奈　　稀少，惟有候　飛來，惟一期尚難預定明耳。</p>
<h3>喬奇怕沈敏</h3>
<p>— 陶願聖</p>
<p>在之江堂遇見前奇和他的朋友，友，我於是　喬奇關於他和沈敏的事　因爲風傳喬奇追求沈敏　經很久了，却緣何還不聞喬奇求得沈敏的消息！</p>
<p>喬奇木來叫徐家駒，是中法劇校的畢業生，曾參加上海劇藝社，大鍾，天風，上藝，等劇團的公開表演，也曾担任過小劇團的導演，每次排練和上演時他總是很用功很認眞的，所以成續很不錯，進步也速，七月初且將在卡爾登演出。沈敏是一個活潑的小姑娘，今年大槪二十歲，曾在法政學院做過一年級生，她很能演戲，若是肯努力，前途是無量的。喬奇之認識她，該是二年前在上海劇藝社吧？</p>
<p>據說，喬奇追求沈敏是可以的，喬奇追得沈敏也是可能的；　是喬奇　一本假正經地對我說：</p>
<p>「不要提起沈敏吧，我眞怕她。現在我連跟她在一塊兒走路都不敢了。多事的人看見我和沈敏一道，總說我們在戀愛了。天曉得！那是沒有的事她和他很好！（他指　他的朋友，一個黑黑的南洋人。）」</p>
<p>我聞不出道句話是不是有點酸氣，只是我覺得多事的人的確太多事了，好端端地使一個男人怕一個女人。</p>

<h3>靠山調</h3>
<p>— 澤夫</p>
<p>靠山調為天津一帶最流行之俗曲，亦稱山落子（北方稱俗戲俗曲均為落子），或名天津什謠（或作拾搖，擬誤）。原係田野之山　，故名　山：後則流入都市，於是落子館中亦常見其歌唱。唱時僅用三絃伴奏，聲調迂綏，一字一句，甚少連綴，每句之末，常有甚長空腔，而唱者往往放喉髙歌，以愈高愈妙，則猶存山歌原　意味。歌詞純係叙述體，各分段落，長短不一，惟每段末一句之前，例有「哎哎哎哎喲」一句虛腔，此與各地俗曲，頗有相同之處。至歌詞內容不外男女愛悅之類。共中以一捧叉桿」一毬，流行最慶。所謂叉桿，乃北方妓女姘夫負有保護之資者之稱，此辭即歌妓女與姘夫幽會之故事，惟方音頗多，若非註釋，殊難明其辭　也。</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（六）一彈指</p>
<p>城道：「她們來了，談些什麽呢？翠珍道：一什麽都談，談學堂裏的功課；談衣服，怎樣是時行的；　菜飯，那一家便宜：談電影，那　是新片子，那裏是老片子（我倒是像到了外　，她們說的話，我不大聽得　」維城笑了，又問道：「翠珍姊，你在陳家吃飯，是怎麽樣的？」翠珍道：「吃飯是我和陳小姐一塊兒吃的。我也問過陳小姐，說假使我不到上海來，你難道是一個人吃的。她說，那是和她們一塊兒吃。」維城道：「菜一定是很好的了？」　珍道：「那是的。我在想，也許是陳小姐特別叮囑了廚子，或者是她加了廚子的　」</p>
<p>維城又道：「你走了，國芳就沒上　明？」翠珍道：「走上了兩個半天。我看她陪了我說話，陪了我玩耍，倒把　書的事丟在　後，實在太不安了，因此我再也不能不回來。城弟，那陳小姐，怎麽這樣好的？我自己在想，是一個鄉下姑娘，跑到上海去，給人家瞧不起是有的：碰到這個陳小姐，眞是做夢也不會想到。」翠珍的愉快，在她臉上顯現出來。維城笑道：「陳小姐的好，一半也是為了翠珍姊好，她才好的。翠珍姊，你現在是回到鄉裏來了，上海的印象，一定會印在腦海海　很深吧？」翠珍道：「那是永遠不會忘掉的；那個外國人　的　，喚什麽，喚大菜，要拿了刀吃：那個一塊白布上，又會冒出個人來說話：這些，我都算見識過了。可是城弟，那個轟轟轟的車輪聲音，至今還是留在我斗朶　，生長在鄕　的人，到底還該生長在鄕　，住不了幾天，倒又想　鄉　　的好處了。」翠珍見維城閉著眼，當做要瞌睡，站起來想走，維城睜了眼笑道；你說你的，我聽　怪有興趣。」翠珍道：「今天沒有可說的了，明天再說吧。這幾天我舅舅來不來？」維城不假思索的答道·「沒有來。我相信他也該覺悟了，以後不會來。」（一○七）</p>

<h3>Japanese Naval Forces Assist in Operations in Zhejiang and Jiangxi, Fierce Fighting Near Lubao in Guangdong</h3>
<p>Allied News Agency, Shanghai Dispatch: The Japanese Fleet in China Press Office announced at 11:00 AM on the 19th that the Japanese Naval Forces stationed in China, in order to support the Army's operations in Zhejiang and Jiangxi, maintained close contact and cooperated in the operations. The battle achievements are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>In the Poyang Lake area, the naval forces, while strengthening the security of the occupied areas, continued to advance, opening up waterways in the area and covering the landing of the army forces. On June 6th, the naval landing force swept through the area near Kangshan and occupied it. On the 13th, they advanced to a location about six nautical miles downstream of Poyang, suppressing it with artillery fire. On the 17th, they opened up the Guangxin River and advanced to Ruihong.</p>
<p>Since early June, the naval assault force has exerted its full strength to sweep through the coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang, successively launching surprise attacks on Nanqishan Island and nearby islands, Shatigang, Dianxiaguan, and Pishan Island, achieving great victories.</p>
<p>The elite naval air force continuously bombed Wenzhou, Haimen, and Taizhou, etc. From June 8th to 11th, they attacked major facilities and warehouses, either setting them on fire or causing severe damage. In all the above battles, the Japanese side suffered no damage.</p>
<p>Guixi, 19th, Allied News Agency Dispatch: After the Japanese army captured Yingtan and Guixi in one fell swoop on the 16th, they are now preparing to continue their operations. The troops are advancing northeastward in the direction of Fuzhou. The spoils of war include 13 mountain guns and mortars, 7 trucks, 8 freight cars, 15,000 cans of tung oil, 15,000 rails, and a large quantity of railway equipment.</p>
<p>Hankou, 18th, Central News Agency Dispatch: After the Japanese Navy moved out from the Poyang Lake area, the army forces landed at Meixi (seven miles north of Ruihong) to cooperate in the operations. At dawn on the 15th, the minesweeping team braved the rain of bullets to completely destroy the majority of mines laid between Kangshan and Meixi. On one hand, the naval air force cooperated with the navy in fiercely bombing the defending forces' positions and strafing with machine guns. Another unit broke through the defense line at Chuanjia Sai (three li downstream of Ruihong) and successfully opened up the Jinjiang waterway.</p>
<p>Southern China Front, Qianqian, 19th, Central News Agency Dispatch: On the afternoon of the 18th, the Japanese army in southern China launched a fierce attack near Wanjiao on the left bank of the North River. The Japanese air force also fiercely bombed the opposite bank of the North River, forcing the artillery positions. At 2:00 PM, the Japanese army advanced to the defense line on the southern bank of Lubao and immediately crossed the river. At 7:30 PM, they finally completely occupied Lubao.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 19th, Allied News Agency Dispatch: The Japanese army in southern Guangdong has begun to advance towards the Xijiang River in Guangdong. Among them, the Japanese army units advancing towards Lubao launched a joint land and air attack on Huangtangxu. On the evening of the 17th, they completely occupied it. On the 18th, they attacked the Wei Chan defense line in the early morning and are currently engaged in fierce battles in the vicinity of She (south of Lubao).</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Occupies the Spice Islands</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th, Allied News Agency Dispatch: A Japanese naval reporter reported from Ambon that the Spice Islands (Molucca Islands) north of Australia were completely controlled by the Japanese army on May 24th. The islands of Buru and Sanana in the Spice Islands, which had not yet been occupied, were occupied by Japanese sailors on that day.</p>
<h3>Japan Refreshes Administrative Organs</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th, Allied News Agency Dispatch: In order to actively promote the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Japanese government, while establishing a new system in the political world, aims to ensure the sufficiency of necessary personnel in various southern regions. Therefore, it is implementing the refreshing of administrative organs to make administrative efficiency simpler and more effective. At the same time, it will mobilize surplus officials to various southern regions. This policy was decided in the previous cabinet meeting and specific methods were determined. Today, at the regular cabinet meeting, the heads of each intelligence bureau presented explanations, which were fully approved. The main points of the intelligence bureau's announcement are as follows: The key points of this plan for simplifying and strengthening administrative organs are roughly: Reduce officials in each government office, taking June 1st as the standard, to refresh affairs and simplify the structure. After this, except for those approved by the cabinet, no personnel may be increased or supplemented. The rate of reduction of officials is 30% for central agencies, 20% for local agencies, and 10% for technical agencies. The same standard applies overseas. Study and improve the treatment policy to meet needs.</p>
<h3>The Oriental Daily Commentary on the Japan-Thailand Agreement</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th, Allied News Agency Dispatch: As the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere progresses steadily, it is essential for the countries of East Asia to exchange goods and cooperate closely. Therefore, the establishment of the Japan-Thailand loan has profound and significant meaning for the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. On the 19th, editorials in local newspapers unanimously praised this. For example, the "Asahi Shimbun" stated that after Thailand severed relations with Britain and the United States, its funds were frozen, which caused economic turmoil in Thailand. The establishment of this Japan-Thailand loan not only resolves this problem satisfactorily, but also has good effects on the survival of both countries and the expansion of the entire economy of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The "Hochi Shimbun" stated that the establishment of this Japan-Thailand loan agreement not only benefits Thailand, but also tightens Japan-Thailand economic relations and lays a solid foundation for the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, so its meaning is actually very significant.</p>
<h3>Dutch Harbor Oil Depot Hit by Bomb and Catches Fire, Burning for Several Days</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th, Haitong News Agency Dispatch: The "Asahi Shimbun" today published a witness report stating that Japanese planes bombed Dutch Harbor, and an oil depot was hit and caught fire, burning for several days. A meeting is scheduled for early next month.</p>
<h3>Indian Congress Party Standing Committee Schedules Meeting for Early Next Month to Discuss Policy on the Current Situation</h3>
<p>Lishi Ben, 19th, Allied News Agency Dispatch: According to news from New Delhi, the Standing Committee of the Indian National Congress will meet in early July at Gandhi's headquarters in Walterha to discuss India's policy on the current situation and Gandhi's demand that British troops withdraw from India.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 18th, Allied News Agency Dispatch: Regarding the riot in Sindh Province, India, a dispatch from Lisbon states that although the British army and police have made every effort to suppress the riot, it is becoming more rampant due to the advocacy of independence by Indians abroad and the influence of Gandhi, Nehru, and others' statements that the British must withdraw from India, etc. It is reported that thousands of Furey tribesmen have been arrested, but they are not discouraged and their morale is high. They have begun to move towards the state of Chiputanara, and it seems that they will attack the state's military center, Kaisa Luma. At present, the riot situation in various parts of the state is like wildfire, unstoppable. Because the area is a barren desert hills, the desert people are using the terrain, using camels and horses as desert tanks, launching elusive guerrilla warfare, and constantly advancing eastward. The British authorities are completely helpless in the face of this.</p>
<h3>Old Currency to be Prohibited from Circulation Sequentially, Mr. Zhou Fohai's Remarks, to be Implemented First in Nanjing and Shanghai</h3>
<p>Central News Agency News: Regarding the issue of prohibiting the circulation of old currency, Mr. Zhou Fohai made the following remarks yesterday: There are only two days left until the deadline for exchanging old currency. After the deadline, areas will be designated, and the circulation of old currency will be prohibited sequentially in phases. I have stated this repeatedly. The government is currently drafting the necessary laws and regulations on this matter, and will implement them first in Nanjing and Shanghai (including the two special zones). Within a few days after the exchange deadline, a decree will be promulgated and implemented. After the prohibition of circulation of old currency, if there are still those in the area who use old currency as currency for mutual payment, once discovered, in addition to confiscating all of the old currency they used, they will also be given appropriate punishment. The degree of punishment is still under consideration. As for the purpose of this prohibition of circulation of old currency, although it is only to prohibit the people from using old currency as currency, since old currency cannot be circulated and used, it is really of no benefit for the people to hold old currency, which is tantamount to abandoning their own property. Therefore, I deeply hope that they will quickly exchange for new legal tender during the exchange period.</p>
<h3>Development Status of Industry in New Guinea</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th, Central News Agency: According to a telegram from a certain base in the South Seas, Mr. Matsuda Sadanobu, advisor to the former Dutch West New Guinea Civil Affairs Department, arrived there by plane on the 18th to discuss important matters. According to the conversation, the development status of important industries in New Guinea and other places is as follows: Security on the former Dutch East Indies Outer Islands has been restored and has entered the construction phase. The rich underground resources, forestry, and general industries will be gradually investigated and developed, and the progress is quite smooth. In terms of underground resources, attention is paid to the development of oil fields, coal mines, and timber in New Guinea. The oil field near Bavo in the northern part of the island is rich in reserves and has been secretly developed by the Dutch New Guinea Petroleum Development Company. Most of the island's oil fields have not yet been mined, and their output and raw materials rank first in the world. In addition, the phosphorus ore resources near Maroguaya Li, the capital of New Guinea, have been exploited and have great prospects for the future. Our survey team is currently conducting investigations in Bavo Maroguaya Li, enduring hardships. Because the area is a dense forest wetland, located under the equator, our survey team braved the invasion of miasma and was finally able to complete the task. The local residents, the Papua Aiyi, have a good impression of the Japanese army, either guiding the Japanese army or helping to saw down the dense forest. They also cooperate in other restoration work. Other resources, such as livestock, cotton, edible oil, spices, and agricultural resources in Timor Island, Danibar Island, and Halmahera Island, are extremely rich. In order to mobilize materials within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, preparations have been made for development.</p>
<h3>Polang is Willing to Cooperate with Japan to the End</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th, Allied News Agency Dispatch: A telegram from Polang states that Polang is in the southern part of the former Dutch Celebes, the only land ruled by a queen. A reporter followed the survey team to the Marili Mine north of Lonyi Bay. On the way to Polang, they had the opportunity to meet the Queen of Polang. The reporter asked about her hopes for the regeneration of Asia. She replied as follows: I am willing to be under Japanese rule. The residents are quite satisfied with the current situation. There is no shortage of materials, and a bumper harvest is expected this autumn. During the Dutch rule, they used Indonesians to discriminate against us in everything. We deeply know that if we do not cooperate with Japan in the future, our true happiness cannot be found. In the war, no matter how difficult the situation, we will cooperate with Japan to the end.</p>

<h3>Churchill Suddenly Arrives in Washington, Meets with Roosevelt Again to Discuss Various Issues Related to Operations, British Chief of the General Staff Brooke and Others Accompany Him</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 19th, Allied News Agency Dispatch: According to news from Washington, White House Secretary Oley announced to the press yesterday afternoon that British Prime Minister Churchill arrived at the White House yesterday and is scheduled to hold his first meeting with President Roosevelt tonight. This is the second time that Prime Minister Churchill has visited the United States in half a year since the United States entered the war. Those who came with him this time include important figures such as British Army Chief of Staff General Brooke and Major General Ismay, Secretary of the British-American Staff Team. Churchill's trip is as secret as the last time. The content discussed may be related to the opening of the second battlefield in Europe.</p>
<p>Washington, 18th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: British Prime Minister Churchill arrived here on the 18th and immediately visited President Roosevelt to discuss various issues related to the war. It is heard that the two politicians are scheduled to hold their first meeting at the White House tonight (2:00 PM Shanghai Summer Time on the 19th). British Air Force Chief of Staff General Brooke and Major General Ismay, Secretary-General of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the British Army, Navy, and Air Force, also came with him.</p>
<p>London, 19th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: Prime Minister Churchill's trip to the United States was kept strictly confidential in advance. Since the outbreak of the war, this is the third time that Churchill has gone abroad to hold meetings with President Roosevelt. As for General Brooke, who is traveling with the Prime Minister, he is 58 years old and has served as Chief of Staff since November 1941.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 19th, Haitong News Agency Dispatch: After the news of Prime Minister Churchill's visit to the United States was released, people in Washington felt great interest. When Vincent, Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, was asked about this, he replied that Roosevelt would discuss very important issues with Churchill, and the possibility of opening a second battlefield might be discussed. Keen observers pointed out that the news of Churchill's visit to the United States can divert the attention of the general military. There have been many comments on the changes in the Libyan war and the British authorities' news policy. Now that Churchill's visit to the United States has been heard, the focus of the discussion will be shifted. A document from London stated that the Prime Minister arrived in Washington with British Chief of the General Staff Sir Brooke, but US news stated that Churchill would soon hold negotiations with Roosevelt.</p>
<h3>Various Parties Speculate on the Mission of Churchill's Trip</h3>
<p>Washington, 19th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: What is the real intention of British Prime Minister Churchill's visit here? It is now the focus of discussion among the general public here. According to White House Secretary Oley, President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill will discuss war strategies and ways to win. The general public believes that this is a platitude and that its meaning is vague, which is not enough to satisfy public opinion. Various parties have been speculating about Prime Minister Churchill's trip. One of the most popular theories is that Churchill's visit to the United States is closely related to Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov's visit to the United States. After Molotov's visit to the United States was completed, the British and American countries announced their intention to open a second battlefield, and this issue may be the focus of discussion between Prime Minister Churchill and President Roosevelt. In addition, Churchill's trip is accompanied by many senior British military officers, which shows that military issues are more important than political and diplomatic issues. Another group believes that various serious difficulties have forced Prime Minister Churchill to visit the United States again. For example, the war situation in Libya has caused anxiety in some quarters, and the Soviet Union's position is also unclear. Optimistic and pessimistic views are mixed. Moreover, as a result of enemy submarine activities, Allied merchant ships have suffered heavy losses, which is also an important issue at the moment.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 19th, Haitong News Agency Dispatch: A Haitong News Agency reporter has recently learned from well-informed sources in neutral countries that it was Soviet Foreign People's Commissar Molotov who urged Churchill to visit the United States for the second time. It is heard that after Molotov returned to Europe from the United States, he met with Churchill in London and strongly urged the British Prime Minister to personally step forward and urge Roosevelt to take more active and effective measures. It is rumored that Churchill stated to Molotov that the opening of a second battlefield would be conditional on the United States quickly sending a large number of troops to participate in the war. It is heard that Roosevelt revealed to Molotov that the United States' ships, artillery, and tanks were not enough for a large-scale expedition. It is unknown whether Molotov informed Churchill of this situation.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 19th, Allied News Agency Dispatch: Churchill's visit to the United States is enough to show the extreme anxiety of the United Nations. According to Reuters, the central topics of this meeting are: How to launch the second front? How to replenish the lack of ships? How to reverse the defeats in East Asia and North Africa? How to strengthen US material assistance to Britain and the Soviet Union? However, according to diplomatic circles here, the alliance between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union has indicated that they are trapped in the abyss of fighting Germany, and there are no effective measures to deal with the defeats in East Asia. As for the so-called opening of the second front, it not only requires huge military supplies and a large number of ships, but also must face enormous dangers, so it is difficult to expect it to be realized quickly. Therefore, this meeting is only to study how to increase US production to strengthen assistance to Britain and the Soviet Union and to remedy the shortage of ships. According to this, this meeting is not worth paying attention to.</p>
<h3>Soviet Supreme Council Approves Anglo-Soviet Treaty; Molotov Reports on Trip Abroad</h3>
<p>Moscow, 19th (Allied News Agency) – The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union yesterday approved the Anglo-Soviet Treaty. At the meeting, Foreign Commissar Molotov first reported on his visit to London and Washington.</p>
<p>Moscow, 18th (Allied News Agency) – The Supreme Provisional Soviet Union held a meeting at the Kremlin on the evening of the 18th. Stalin and other key government figures attended. Foreign Minister Molotov gave a detailed report on the conclusion of the Anglo-Soviet Military Treaty and the US-Soviet Economic Agreement. He stated that, as a result of the conclusion of this agreement, the US credit loan to the Soviet Union has increased from 1 billion gold yuan to 3 billion yuan. Furthermore, as a result of discussions with British and American leaders, complete agreement has been reached on the establishment of a second front in Europe this year.</p>
<p>Moscow, 18th (Havas News Agency) – In his report to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Molotov strongly stated that the Soviet Union has not concluded any secret clauses with the United States or the United Kingdom. As for Article 5 of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty and the principles established regarding the post-war European organization, there is absolutely nothing suspicious. The Soviet Union has never had any territorial ambitions or demands in Europe, Asia, or even within Iran, neither in the past nor in the future. Moreover, this principle is entirely consistent with the statement made by Supreme Defense Commissar Stalin on November 6, 1941. The negotiations I conducted in London and Washington, especially the agreement on opening a second front in Europe and intensifying the supply of military materials to the Soviet Union, are of utmost importance, he said. Stockholm, Sweden, 19th (Reuter’s Agency) – A report from Moscow states that Foreign Commissar Molotov delivered a speech at a special meeting of the Soviet Supreme Committee yesterday, requesting the United States and Britain to step up aid to the Soviet Union. It is said that the Anglo-Soviet Treaty is extremely important and will be submitted to the Supreme Committee for review and approval. Mr. Molotov then read aloud the important points of the treaty and elaborated on Anglo-Soviet relations. He then discussed British and American aid to the Soviet Union, stating that the Soviet Union must contend with Germany. Although Britain and the United States have shipped large quantities of war equipment to the Soviet Union, unfortunately many ships have been sunk by German naval and air forces en route. After personally negotiating with British and American authorities during this trip to Washington and London, Britain and the United States have agreed to intensify aid to the Soviet Union in the second half of the year. The discussion covered a wide range of topics, the most important of which was the opening of the second front. The relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States will further improve in the future. This agreement can only be regarded as the preliminary work for establishing a broader agreement. In conclusion, Molotov guaranteed that the Anglo-Soviet agreement does not contain any secret clauses.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 18th (Allied News Agency) – According to Reuters, Field Marshal Dill, the former British Chief of Staff, is currently in the United States in his capacity as the British Chief Representative of the Anglo-American Joint Chiefs of Staff. On the evening of the 17th, he attended the United Nations General Assembly and delivered a speech, stating briefly: "We deeply wish the United Nations a prosperous future, even greater than we hope for. However, there are still some disappointments and darkness ahead of us. The difficult stage of the war has not yet been overcome. At present, we should have a new determination to sacrifice everything, risk everything, and enhance our spirit of dedication. This is what this war requires."</p>
<h3>Sevastopol Situation Critical Under Intense German Land and Air Attacks; German Communiqué Claims Breakthrough into Inner Defense Lines; Soviet Counterattack on Upper Donets River</h3>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Allied News Agency) – News from here today states that the northern part of the entire fortress of Sevastopol is now in the hands of German forces. The Soviet defense, under the intense German assault, has been shattered.</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Reuter’s Agency) – German military circles believe that the occupation of key defensive fortifications such as the Gorky Fortress north of Sevastopol by the German-Romanian forces is of decisive value. German forces have now broken through into the inner defense perimeter, and the enemy's position is extremely precarious. Yesterday's German war report stated that German forces are advancing towards a point three kilometers from the entrance to the port of Sevastopol, which military circles also consider important. As for the defense of southern Sevastopol, it has also lost its value, as German forces will soon be able to attack it from the rear.</p>
<p>Fuehrer Headquarters, 19th (Reuter’s Agency) – This afternoon's German war report stated that German infantry operating in northern Sevastopol have penetrated deep into the enemy's final defense line, reaching Severnaya Bay opposite Sevastopol. As a result of twelve days of hard fighting by the German forces, with the exception of the artillery battery in the southwestern corner, the entire northern fortress is in German hands. The uncaptured battery is expected to be captured soon. From June 7th to 17th, the number of prisoners increased to 7,585, capturing 20 tanks, 68 artillery pieces, and countless other military supplies and equipment. A total of 1,288 bunkers and trenches were captured, and 46,329 torpedoes were cleared.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 19th (Reuter’s Agency) – A report from Moscow by the British Exchange Telegraph Company yesterday stated that the residents of Sevastopol have become cave dwellers. The situation in the city is extremely dire, with most streets reduced to rubble. Since the end of May, residents have been unable to live in the city and have been hiding in cellars 24 hours a day to avoid shells and bombs. The German offensive against Sevastopol has indeed made considerable progress.</p>
<h3>Analysis of the Entire Eastern Front Situation</h3>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet border, 18th (Havas News Agency) – Nearly a year has passed since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war. An analysis of the entire battlefield is as follows: The situation in the port of Sevastopol is precarious, not unlike that of Leningrad at the beginning. The Axis forces continue to advance, and casualties on both sides are heavy. There is little doubt that this fortress is in imminent danger. On the upper reaches of the Donets River, German forces under General Bock continue to attack the Red Army positions. The enemy has already gained a foothold north of the area and established positions on the east bank of the upper Donets River. The Red Army authorities are well aware of the urgency of the situation and have already begun a counterattack. Losses in manpower and resources are heavy, but they have failed to reverse the situation. The German High Command, disregarding the Red Army's determined resistance, has already deployed heavy artillery positions. In the Kharkov region, General Bock's forces, including multiple infantry divisions, will launch a major counterattack once the heavy rains cease. Their goal is to occupy the industrialized triangle area. It is expected that after the fall of the port of Sevastopol, the German forces will send a large number of reinforcements to support them. South of Leningrad, German forces are currently intensifying their offensive, but according to Soviet sources, the Red Army is attacking German positions in the Volkhov region to relieve the siege of the Red Army between Novgorod and Lyuban, and attempting to contain the German forces to prevent them from advancing on Leningrad from the north. According to the latest news, the German concentration in southern Finland has not yet been completed, largely due to transportation difficulties. According to the opinions of general observers, German forces will not be able to attack Murmansk and Leningrad for the time being.</p>
<h3>Wartime Measures in Cairo, Egypt; Valuables Stored in Vaults</h3>
<p>Ankara, 19th (Reuter’s Agency) – The British authorities have refused to declare Cairo a demilitarized city. The Egyptian government has ordered the transfer of Tutankhamun's golden sarcophagus and other valuable objects from the tomb to the central bank's steel vault.</p>
<h3>Second Anniversary of the German-Turkish Friendship Treaty; Relations Between the Two Countries Increasingly Close</h3>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Reuter’s Agency) – The German Foreign Ministry spokesman announced yesterday at an information conference on the anniversary of the German-Turkish Friendship Treaty that the German-Turkish Friendship Treaty is based on the interests of both countries and was established on mutual trust between Germany and Turkey. At the beginning of the establishment of the treaty, London believed that German-Turkish relations would inevitably develop in another direction, but the facts are not so. Turkey has always adopted a friendly attitude towards Germany.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 19th (Reuter’s Agency) – A Turkish radio station commented yesterday on the anniversary of the German-Turkish Friendship Treaty, stating that the friendly relations between Germany and Turkey have become increasingly close in the past twelve months, and this has been the case in the past and will continue to improve in the future.</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Havas News Agency) – A semi-official source here recently released a message stating that although the Allied powers have tried to seduce Turkey in every possible way, the country still adheres to its neutrality and is not swayed. Although it has signed a mutual assistance treaty with Britain, it still maintains friendly relations with Germany, because the two nations, Germany and Turkey, have had uninterrupted friendly relations for twenty years. The recent friendship treaty established between the two sides was born in this spirit.</p>
<p>Turkish Parliament to Discuss National Defense Budget</p>
<p>Istanbul, 18th (Havas News Agency) – It has been learned that the National Assembly will meet tomorrow to discuss a bill submitted by the committee, proposing the issuance of national bonds worth 150 million pounds (Turkish currency) for national defense expenditures.</p>

<p>Ankara, Turkey, 19th (Havas News Agency) – The semi-official Anatolian News Agency issued a message today stating, "According to responsible sources, several American aircraft landed in Turkey some days ago, not intentionally flying over Turkey. Their landing near Ankara and Aliifia was out of necessity. This fact has been clarified when American airmen were interrogated by the authorities."</p>
<p>Bucharest, Romania, 18th (Havas News Agency) – A "Global News" Berlin correspondent cabled that German political figures commenting on the incident of American aircraft violating Turkish airspace generally said that the Anglo-Saxons could not open a second front in Europe and turned to wanting to take action in the Near East. However, this plan is currently difficult to realize, because if Britain wants to have a presence in the Near East, it must have a large number of ships.</p>
<h3>Violent Gunfire on the Colombian Coast; Axis Submarine Engages with American Warship</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 19th (Allied News Agency) – According to news from Bogota, the capital of Colombia, violent gunfire was heard off the Colombian coast on Wednesday night. It is believed that this was the result of an engagement between an Axis submarine and an American destroyer, which proves the boldness of Axis submarines operating in the Caribbean Sea. The Bogota news did not provide details, but it is claimed here that the reported engagement indicates that Axis submarines can now operate freely in the Caribbean Sea, as the Colombian coast is the southernmost point of the Caribbean Sea.</p>
<p>Washington, 18th (Havas News Agency) – The Navy Department has announced that a small Norwegian freighter was sunk by a submarine in the Gulf of Mexico. The rescued crew members have landed in a nearby port.</p>

<p>German Announcement of Submarine Warfare Results</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Reuter’s Agency)</p>
<p>The German High Command issued the following communiqué yesterday, commenting on the continued sinking of nineteen British and American merchant ships in the Atlantic and Caribbean: The United States government has now expanded its defensive shipping measures, intensified the transport of war necessities overseas, and requisitioned all seaworthy vessels for escort duty. Even motorboats and private yachts have been requisitioned by the US military to defend against the ever-increasing danger of submarine attacks. In addition, the United States has expanded patrol cruises to avoid German submarines. However, German submarines recently attacked their heavily defended convoys, sinking twelve ships carrying important materials, totaling 109,000 tons. In the past four days, the enemy has lost no fewer than thirty-three ships, totaling 220,000 tons, mostly sunk in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. Seven warships protecting the convoys have also been sunk, including two cruisers and five destroyers. The defensive measures taken by the enemy have now proven to be incorrect. The effectiveness of German torpedoes has made it impossible for Britain and the United States to reverse the serious dangers to shipping.</p>

<h3>Death of German Mechanized Unit Commander Hühnlein</h3>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Reuter’s Agency) – Hühnlein, the commander of the National Socialist Party Motor Corps, died of stomach disease in Munich yesterday morning. Mr. Hühnlein was a world-renowned car racing expert. Whenever there were car races, Mr. Hühnlein would not hesitate to travel far and wide to watch them. In addition to the positions conferred by the Fuehrer, Mr. Hühnlein's most important duties were various matters related to the Motor Corps Commander. Since the outbreak of the war, the work has become even more arduous. Since the first day of the German invasion of Poland, the National Socialist Party Motor Corps has been responsible for transportation work in the occupied areas. Before 1923, Mr. Hühnlein was a professional soldier. Later, because he wanted to join the National Socialist Party, he resigned from his position as a Major in the Army. Mr. Hühnlein participated in the Munich Putsch and was imprisoned with Hitler in the Landsberg Fortress for six months. After his release, he continued to serve the party and worked hard to motorize the stormtroopers. In addition to serving as the Motor Corps Commander, Mr. Hühnlein was also a Major General in the German Army, a member of Parliament since 1938, and one of the leaders of the German National Socialist Party.</p>

<h3>Axis Forces Advance in North Africa; Tobruk Surrounded; Now Within Range of German Artillery; British Build New Defense Line on Egyptian Border</h3>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Reuter’s Agency) – Responsible sources revealed that German-Italian forces have completed the encirclement of Tobruk.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 19th (Allied News Agency) – After fifteen days of attacks by Axis armored forces, the British Eighth Army in North Africa was divided into two groups and forced to retreat to new positions yesterday. One group is now stationed near the Egyptian border, while the other group has retreated to the Tobruk defense line, attempting to defend this strong coastal stronghold against Axis encirclement. A dispatch from Cairo describes this situation, stating that Tobruk is now only connected to the main force of the British army under General Ritchie along the coastal road east to Sollum. German forces are stepping up their encirclement of Tobruk, which is now within range of German artillery.</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Allied News Agency) – Responsible sources here claimed today that after the British forces in Libya withdrew from El Adem and Bir Hakeim, German forces have completed the encirclement around Tobruk. At the same time, after German armored columns crushed British resistance at Bir Hakeim, they continued to advance east, while British forces retreated east towards the Egyptian border. British fortresses south of El Adem were occupied on Wednesday, and several British positions in Acroma were heavily attacked yesterday. British sources regarding the Acroma battle stated that German forces launched a strong attack from dawn until evening. The dispatch did not provide details, but military circles in London suspect that British forces may have withdrawn from Acroma.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 19th (Allied News Agency) – A British dispatch from Cairo today acknowledged that German forces have encircled the Tobruk area and stated that the positions in the western desert are now the same as before the British offensive in November of last year. However, German forces do not occupy the positions directly opposite Egypt at that time. British forces still have troops in the Libyan desert. The road from Tobruk to the east has now been cut off by German forces, and Gambut is now in the hands of the Axis forces. The Axis forces have not exerted significant pressure on Tobruk. Their main force is advancing east from El Adem. The Halfaya Pass remains in British hands.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Libyan border, 18th (Havas News Agency) – According to the latest news from the front, Axis forces are gradually gaining the upper hand on the Libyan front.</p>
<h3>Seven. A Glimpse of Libya</h3>
<p>Libya is located in northern Africa, west of Egypt, and across the Mediterranean Sea from Italy. Therefore, this desert land has always been Italy's forbidden zone. Recent telegrams indicate that the war in Libya is extremely fierce, with German-Italian allied forces and British forces charging at each other with tanks. It is said that both sides are showing signs of exhaustion. A telegram from the Havas News Agency in the Swiss capital contains a noteworthy sentence: "...At the same time, Berlin expressed optimism about the future of the Libyan war, but remained silent." In the scorching heat of over 100 degrees, both sides can only use tanks to engage in combat, making it difficult to determine the outcome in a short period. If the Axis forces can pose a threat to the Near East countries in North Africa, the British forces' desperate struggle here will have a somewhat restraining effect, prolonging the war within Soviet territory. The Libyan war has not yet come to an end as of the reporter's deadline, but it has attracted worldwide attention. Many people must be speculating about the future destiny of this desert region, with different opinions. The reporter will not recklessly make judgments here and will let the facts reveal the observations of the discerning gentlemen. Administratively, Libya is divided into two parts: Tripolitania and Cyrenaica. The capital of the former is the famous Tripoli, and the capital of the latter is Benghazi. Each has a governor stationed there. The total area is over 420,000 square miles, and the population is approximately 770,000. There are fertile spring lands in the middle of the desert, which Libya's farmland relies on for irrigation.</p>
<p>Benghazi is located in the northwest of Cyrenaica, on the Gulf of Sidra, bordering the Mediterranean coast. The coastline is lined with tall buildings. For the past thirty years, Italians have been continuously developing it, expanding the urban area as much as possible, making it more than three times larger than the original city. The city has wide streets and modern buildings. A park has been built next to the old Arab district for the city's residents to relax and enjoy themselves. There is also a modern arena where various sports competitions such as horse racing, ball games, and races are held in late September every year. Currently, with the tensions of war in North Africa, Benghazi has become a vital hub for Italy to transport troops and supplies. The land in the surrounding countryside is extremely fertile, with orchards, vineyards, and bean fields everywhere, producing abundant yields every year.</p>
<p>The coastline of Cyrenaica receives abundant rainfall, sufficient for agricultural needs without the need for irrigation. If there is a severe drought one year in five, Italian engineers take measures to remedy this deficiency by attempting to find artesian wells or excavate spring sources in the area to prevent emergencies. Driving east along the highway on the Libyan coast, one only sees scattered rural villages, all of which are newly settled foreigners. This is originally an American colonization plan, preparing to colonize 80,000 farming families to Libya by this year. Each family must have at least eight people, be of agricultural background, healthy, literate, a member of the Fascist Party, and of good character. The organization of each village is completely consistent, including churches, schools, sports fields, pharmacies, assembly halls, and party headquarters. All agricultural equipment is supplied by the authorities, such as houses, pigsties, granaries, seeds, farm tools, machinery, and other utensils. However, those who leave their hometowns for Libya should have the spirit and courage of pioneers. This is how the granary of the Roman Empire was built!</p>
<p>The tip of Cyrenaica - the city of Cyrene. Near the springs in the mountains, there are ancient bathhouses. Therefore, the Italian governor once renovated the bathhouses for private use. Moreover, there is a villa on the mountain, overlooking the magnificent scenery of ancient and modern times, with an unobstructed view. This is the greatest city established by the Greeks overseas. Now, only broken statues and dilapidated walls remain, all piles of rubble. North of the city, countless ancient tombs remain. In the 7th century BC, Greeks fled to this place and built the city of Cyrene, which was bustling and prosperous for seven hundred years. In its heyday, it is said that the city had as many as 100,000 residents.</p>
<p>One thing can prove the prosperity of the city of Cyrene. A record was once found on a hard stone excavated from the ruins. Between 331 and 323 BC, when there was a great famine in Greece, the city of Cyrene transported a total of 29,000 tons of grain to relieve the famine in its homeland.</p>
<p>Less than ten miles from the city of Cyrene is a commercial port called Apollonia. At that time, countries near and far along the Mediterranean coast, such as Greece, Syria, and cities in the Egyptian Delta, had to send ships to Apollonia for trade.</p>
<p>The philosopher Aristippus of Cyrene, who advocated pleasure as the supreme goal of life, the atheist Theodorus, the geographer Eratosthenes, who first determined the length of the meridian, and the poet Callimachus all lived in Cyrene.</p>
<p>After the Greeks lost power, Cyrene fell under Egyptian rule and was then occupied by Rome. In 115 AD, the Jewish residents of the area massacred Romans and Libyans, dealing a great blow to the prosperous city of Cyrene. After the fourth century, invasions by indigenous barbarians and damage from earthquakes gradually led to the city's decline. Traveling east along the coast from Cyrene, one only sees crisscrossing fields, all agricultural areas. Derna, formerly known as fertile due to mountain spring irrigation, is still very fertile today. Derna's abundant water source is extremely important for the Italian army's strategy. Tobruch, a coastal city east of Derna, lacks fresh water, so it uses ships equipped with water tanks to transport water from Derna. Along the coast of Cyrenaica, only Derna and Benghazi have fresh water that can supply local needs.</p>
<p>Advancing along the road where chariots of the ancient Roman Empire once passed, one reaches Tobruch. From here, the fertile land gradually decreases for 110 miles, followed by a desert. The British air and naval forces bombed here last year to prevent the Italian army from advancing. Italy has a naval base and army barracks near the port. The bay here is formed by a peninsula curving eastward into the sea. The harbor is two miles long and less than a mile wide. It is ice-free all year round, and large warships can freely enter and exit, making it the best military port in North Africa. Looking at a map of Africa, the area of Libya cannot be considered small, at least five and a half times larger than the mainland United States. It is a pity that only a very small portion of it is suitable for planting. Except for the coastal Mediterranean area of Cyrenaica and some areas of Tripoli, the place names that can be found on the map only indicate that a small team of sentries is stationed there, or that there are a few mud houses, fertile land in the desert, or that there is a water source. The rest of the land is either full of sand and gravel or a vast expanse of barren yellow sand, with a sultry climate and no signs of human habitation for days. The British side admits that the German threat to the port of Tobruch is increasing, and General Rommel's troops will soon come into contact with the first line of defense of this fortress. In fact, the port of Tobruch has been surrounded by Axis forces, and the only retreat is eastward along the coast. A British light force is currently disrupting the German-Italian armored vehicle formations on the southwest sides of the port to create a restraining effect, preventing them from directly attacking the port. General Ritchie seems to have made a major determination to defend this fortress at all costs. However, according to the latest news, the British General Headquarters, due to the strong pressure from the Axis forces, has no other choice but to withdraw its troops behind the port of Tobruch to set up a new defense line between the port and the Egyptian border and continue to resist. There is no definite news in the Acroma area, only that the British army has abandoned its original position and is making a large-scale retreat towards the port of Tobruch. Based on this, after the British army retreated from these two strongholds, namely Acroma and El Adem, it is now only holding the Tobruch fortress. Moreover, in the past two days, Axis forces have reportedly concentrated in the El Adem area, and a large number of reinforcements and military supplies have been continuously transported in, preparing to launch a large-scale offensive to the east. General Rommel's goal is clearly to isolate the port of Tobruch, ensuring that the British army in the port cannot be transferred to participate in future offensives, so the German army can take the opportunity to attack eastward. Therefore, General Rommel considers the battle for the port of Tobruch to be very important.</p>
<h3>German War Report</h3>
<p>Berlin, 19th, Havas News Agency - The German High Command last night issued a detailed report on the Libyan war for the first time, stating that the Axis forces have now broken into the Mediterranean coast and are heavily advancing towards Tobruch. Many British troops have been surrounded by us. Since the occupation of Bir Hakeim, the Axis forces have advanced from the south, attacking the flanks of the British forces in the Gazala area and engaging the British forces in Tobruch. Fierce battles took place in Acroma on June 14, destroying many enemy armored vehicles. Therefore, the German-Italian allied forces have now been able to advance towards the coast. Later, a South African brigade was annihilated in Acroma, and another British and South African division each suffered heavy losses. The battles in the Gazala area were also very fierce. The Axis forces occupied 10,400 square kilometers in that area. The German air force assisted the army in advancing north and east, with significant results, destroying many enemy tanks and other vehicles. In the past four days, German aircraft have shot down a total of 54 British aircraft.</p>
<h3>Mediterranean Naval Battle - British Losses</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 19th, Havas News Agency - News received here from London regarding the attack on the Mediterranean convoy remains silent on the British losses, but provides a detailed description of the naval and air battles, proving the intensity of the fighting. London claims that the sacrifice of the western Mediterranean convoy was to divert the enemy's attention so that the eastern Mediterranean convoy could safely reach Tobruch. According to a correspondent for the Swedish newspaper, the arrival of the convoy in Tobruch is not enough to compensate for the losses suffered by General Ritchie. According to responsible British authorities, they will no longer provide reporters with accurate information on losses, as the public is becoming increasingly uneasy about the failures in Libya.</p>
<p>Rome, 18th, Central News Agency - The Italian Air Force fiercely attacked the British fleet in the Mediterranean. According to an 18th Stefani dispatch, the Italian Air Force in this campaign damaged the British battleship Malaya, 31,000 tons, the aircraft carrier Eagle, 12,600 tons, and the Argus, 14,000 tons.</p>
<h3>Heads of Households Must Collect Rice Purchase Certificates Without Delay</h3>
<p>The date for rice distribution will be announced separately by the authorities.</p>
<p>Lost rice purchase certificates will not be reissued.</p>
<p>The distribution of rice rations based on population in the two concessions has been scheduled to begin on the 22nd. The dates for heads of households in each district to collect their certificates have been specified separately. They are announced daily in the newspapers and also relayed by the Baojia Guidance Department to each Lianbao Jia head to notify each head of household to go to the designated offices for issuing rice purchase certificates on the specified date. The collection of these rice purchase certificates must not be delayed.</p>
<p>Distribution of Rice on the Same Day is a Misunderstanding</p>
<p>Recently, foreigners have mistakenly taken the date for issuing rice purchase certificates as the date for distributing rice. To eliminate this misunderstanding, the French Concession authorities have specifically reiterated that the 22nd of this month is the date for starting to issue rice purchase certificates. As for the date for distributing rice, it will be announced after a decision has been made. People who have received rice purchase certificates are urged to keep them safe and not lose them under any circumstances, as the authorities will not reissue them for any reason.</p>
<p>Rice Purchase Certificates Must Be Kept Safely</p>
<p>A public announcement from the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) Information Office states that there seems to be a misunderstanding among the public regarding the date from which rice can be purchased with the rice purchase certificates issued by the Council. The Council hereby announces that although the issuance of rice purchase certificates to taxpayers is scheduled to begin on June 22 of this year, the date from which rice can be purchased with these certificates has not yet been determined and will be announced separately after a decision is made. People who have obtained SMC rice purchase certificates must keep the certificates safely and must not lose or hand them over to others. The Council will not reissue them under any circumstances. The public must pay attention.</p>
<p>Collection Locations and Dates for Rice Purchase Certificates</p>
<p>The locations for citizens in various districts of the two concessions to collect rice purchase certificates have been arranged and reported in yesterday's newspaper. Upon review, there are still some parts of the Central, Foch, and Petain districts in the French Concession that have not been published.

<h3>Some Pawnshops in the French Concession Resumed Operations Yesterday and Will Request the French Consulate to Amend the Regulations</h3>
<p>Since the 180-odd pawnshops and pledge shops in the French Concession stopped accepting pledges the day before yesterday due to the management regulations of the French Consulate, they have been persuaded by the Pawnshop Association and the Pledge Shop Association. As a result, some resumed accepting pledges yesterday. As for the Pawnshop Association and the Pledge Shop Association, they are currently gathering to discuss and formulate opinions to be submitted to the French Concession authorities, requesting amendments to the regulations to maintain their business. According to the Datong News Agency reporter, the opinions of the industry associations and shops are as follows:</p>
<p>Opinions of the Pawnshop Industry</p>
<p>The Pawnshop Association believes that the French Consulate's regulations this time are indeed largely impossible to implement. The industry's unanimous decision to stop accepting pledges was a last resort. However, the cessation of pledges will inevitably affect the urgent needs of ordinary people for funds and will cause social instability. Therefore, the association is making every effort to persuade its members to temporarily resume accepting pledges as usual. However, until the Consulate's order is amended, accepting pledges as usual will involve many legal violations. Therefore, in addition to annotating in detail the difficult provisions of the Consulate's order and preparing to request amendments, the association also plans to first make a factual statement in writing to the French Concession authorities so that its members can conduct their business in peace. The association also stated that it understands the purpose of the new Consulate's order, which is nothing more than to prevent the acceptance of stolen goods. However, in fact, according to investigations over the past few months, incidents of stolen goods in the 18 pawnshops in the French Concession are extremely rare. Moreover, the competent authorities originally formulated the Shanghai Municipal Regulations for Pawnshop Operations, which had specific provisions for pawnshops receiving stolen goods. Except for items that should be rejected under Rule 10 of the regulations, "Public goods with clear identification or rare and precious items whose prices cannot be determined," pawnshops generally only recognize the goods and not the person, and accept all pledges. The provisions of the new Consulate's order are excessively strict for the managers and employees, shrinking the scope of business and creating a risk of violating regulations at every turn. Therefore, unless the provisions of the new Consulate's order are amended, it is impossible for the members to continue their business.</p>
<h3>Careless Cycling Leads to Fatality</h3>
<p>Wu Chang'an, a nineteen-year-old apprentice youth from Hubei working at Dafeng Yangzahuohao at No. 198 Avenue Edward VII, was riding a bicycle on the afternoon of the 16th when, at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue de Villermont, Zhao Dai Shi, a thirty-one-year-old woman from Shaoxing living at No. 8 Lanfa Lane, Zhaojia Road, Nanshi, carrying her ten-month-old infant named Yue Liang, was crossing Avenue Joffre from Rue de Villermont when Wu's bicycle passed by. Unable to avoid, Wu knocked down Zhao Dai Shi, and the child fell several feet away, suffering serious injuries. The police arrived and took both parties to the police station. The injured child was transferred to Guangci Hospital for treatment but died the day before yesterday. The police sent the child's body to the coroner for examination and returned it to the family yesterday for burial. Meanwhile, the family of the deceased has filed a negotiation with Wu Chang'an, who caused the accident, demanding compensation of 5,000 yuan. The police have also charged Wu with negligent homicide and will handle the case according to the law.</p>
<h3>The Transmission of Leprosy by Ding Fubao</h3>
<p>Everyone knows that leprosy is a contagious disease, similar to tuberculosis, caused by the spread of a bacterium. However, formally speaking, tuberculosis is not as externally visible as leprosy, because leprosy, after a certain period, can cause the skin, fingers, face, etc., to become terrifying images, causing people to fear and avoid it. However, according to recent research by leprosy experts, its contagiousness is not as easy as generally imagined. Doctors and staff in leprosy hospitals are proof of this. They are close to patients every day but have not been infected. This does not negate the contagiousness of leprosy but wants us to know that the transmission of leprosy has conditions in life and prevention.</p>
<p>Take England as an example. In the Middle Ages, there was also an epidemic of leprosy, but today, it has almost disappeared. It is clearly known that this is due to improvements in their lives. The damp wooden houses they used to live in are now made of cement and brick, with good air circulation and sufficient light. Running water can be used for bathing and washing. Special attention is paid to the nutrition of food. Various needs of the human body are fully supplied to resist the reproduction of bacteria. With such reasonable hygiene, a healthy body can naturally be cultivated. Leprosy bacteria have lost their medium of transmission and gradually disappeared. On the contrary, what about China? General living conditions are just the opposite, with dirty, dark, and damp dwellings and poor nutrition, making transmission easy and increasingly widespread. The aforementioned doctors and staff have antiseptic and sterilizing hygiene and healthy resistance, so the virus is not easy to infect them.</p>
<p>From the former perspective, we must pay attention to the patient's lifestyle; from the latter perspective, we should pay attention to preventive hygiene. The establishment of the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association is based on this standpoint, setting up sanatoriums and clinics to treat patients with newly developed medicines and taking in patients to improve their lives. However, in China today, there are as many as millions of leprosy patients, and it is only possible to accommodate over 50,000 people. This is a drop in the bucket, and the goal of eradicating this disease is still far away. Without huge amounts of funding and large-scale accommodation, success cannot be expected. If everyone can work together and provide full financial assistance, it is not impossible to eliminate this major problem. It is hoped that enthusiastic social figures will donate generously during this fundraising campaign of the association, so that ordinary needle-holders will not have the risk of being infected. That would be fortunate.</p>
<h3>The SMC Issues Bonds Worth 5 Million Yuan to Supplement Temporary Expenses, Issued at 92.5% of Face Value</h3>
<p>The SMC recently issued an announcement No. 595, stating that the Council has now decided to issue bonds worth 5 million yuan to cover the expenses specified in this year's temporary expenditure budget. The public is invited to subscribe. The bonds issued this time are denominated in Central Reserve Bank currency (CRB) and bear interest at an annual rate of six percent from the date of purchase. The first interest payment date is December 31 of this year, and subsequent interest payments will be made on June 30 and December 31 of each year. The bonds are issued at 92.5% of face value and will be redeemed by lottery in ten years, starting in December 1948, with 500,000 CRB redeemed each time until the bonds are fully redeemed in October 1957. The security for the redemption and interest payments is the Council's property and the Council's annual tax revenue. The bonds are divided into three denominations: 10,000 yuan, 5,000 yuan, and 1,000 yuan, to facilitate subscription. It is now scheduled to begin issuing the bonds at 10:00 AM on June 22 of this year at the Treasury Bank and Bond Office, No. 257, Finance Department, No. 209 Jiangxi Road, SMC Office. Subscription application forms can be obtained from the head of the Finance Department of the Council. If there are any remaining bonds after the public subscription, the Central Trust Bureau will undertake to purchase them.</p>
<h3>Profiteering from Hoarding: A Rascal's Covetousness</h3>
<p>Feng Jiquan, a Jiangyin native and manager of the Huisheng Foreign Firm at 52 Yanghang Street in the French Concession, has recently been hoarding tin foil and has already made a considerable profit. A rascal named Li Mengquan (27 years old), a Shaoxing native, learned of this and, on the previous day, colluded with two fellow villagers, Wei Chengyou and another who was at large after escaping custody. They went to Feng's house to buy ten packages of tin foil, valued at 7,200 reserve certificates. Li and his accomplices instructed Feng to deliver the goods to No. 46 Sijing Road for payment. Feng believed them to be genuine and ordered his apprentice, Li Weihe, to deliver the goods. Li and his accomplices handed over a Shun Tai Zhuang bank draft. Li Weihe demanded cash payment, but Li Mengquan falsely claimed that if cash was required, they would have to go to a certain place on Jin Shenfu Road to collect it. Consequently, Li Weihe followed Li Mengquan to Jin Shenfu Road. Li Mengquan attempted to escape but was discovered and apprehended. He was taken to the police station, where Li Mengquan confessed to plotting fraud, stating that the stolen goods had already been taken by Wei Chengyou to Tong Fulin, the manager of the Hongsheng Cotton Cloth Shop on Xiangfen Lane. Detectives were immediately dispatched to recover the original stolen goods and bring them back to the police station. Li Mengquan was detained, awaiting the arrest of his accomplices at large, for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Residents in Unlicensed Houses Should Suspend Manufacturing; Continued Operation Will Result in Prosecution by the Bureau</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council issued a public announcement yesterday (June 19), stating: "In the past week, there was an explosion and a fire at a newly established coffee extract factory and a brewery. As a result, seven people died and approximately nine were injured. In view of this, the Bureau hereby announces that anyone engaged in such manufacturing in unlicensed houses should refrain from commencing operations until they obtain a license, and should promptly contact the Industrial and Social Affairs Department at Room 609, Office of the General Office of the Bureau (behind the Guangchang) at No. 609 Jiangxi Road. If manufacturing continues after this announcement, the Bureau will prosecute in court."</p>
<h3>The Modern Accessories for Young Ladies in Their Boudoirs: Women's Wide-Brimmed Straw Hats - Sufficient to Enhance Beauty and Add Charm; Men and Women of Ancient Times All Wore Them Outdoors</h3>
<p>Childhood Memories</p>
<p>The continuous days of plum rain have washed the earth into a different scene, but the weather is still hot and unbearable. When the sun finally comes out, it is scorching and relentless, making one feel like an ant on a hot pot, with no way out. Recently, bicycles have become popular, and many people enjoy cycling in the countryside. However, the scorching sun causes dizziness and flushed faces, with sweat dripping down. When the wind is strong, it blows one's hair into a mess, looking like one has lost a loved one. After spending more than an hour carefully applying makeup, hoping to show off, one ends up looking like a living ghost. Therefore, clever merchants have realized that wide-brimmed straw hats are the perfect product for the season. I recall that in my childhood, every summer, my father would buy a new straw hat for himself and also buy a small straw hat for me. The fluttering blue ribbon on the hat still captivates me. At that time, it was enough to make me feel glorious, and I would show it off among my friends. They would stretch out their small hands, stroking the top of the hat, with their round eyes, the black pupils rolling around, filled with envy. Standing on the swing in the park, going back and forth, the blue ribbon flying in the air, how proud I was! Time flies, and when I grew up to be a teenager, I noticed that no one else was wearing straw hats, and I felt embarrassed to wear one myself. Although I still had fond memories in my heart, the small child, in the vast boudoir, could not display its power to block the sun. I couldn't help but wonder why Chinese women today don't wear straw hats. Is it because customs forbid it? There is no sufficient reason. Is it because they are not beautiful to wear? I fear it would backfire. So why is it?</p>
<p>New Style Straw Hats</p>
<p>If your face is too long or too short, you can choose a straw hat and wear it tilted forward, backward, to the left, or to the right, and it will look good.</p>
<p>Hats and Face</p>
<p>For Western women, hats are not only practical but also an important accessory to enhance beauty. A plain face can look very attractive with a suitable felt hat or a straw hat adorned with flowers. Sometimes it can make the face appear shorter, avoiding a horse-like elongated look that is very unattractive. At other times, it can make the face appear longer, avoiding a pancake-like uncomfortable look. This all depends on the skillful use of tilting the hat forward, backward, to the left, or to the right.</p>
<p>Jeanette MacDonald</p>
<p>I remember that every time I watched Jeanette MacDonald's movies, I always felt that when she wore a hat, her face was of perfect length and shape, charming and beautiful. But in ordinary shots, she was much less attractive. Joan Crawford's performance in "A Woman's Face," with a hat tilted to the side, concealing the half of her face that was scarred from burns, was indeed something that people did not find overly repulsive. Therefore, European and American women pay great attention to the style of hats, often spending a lot of money and patiently trying on hats in fashion companies for a good part of the day, without being satisfied.</p>
<p>The Innate Love of Beauty</p>
<p>The love of beauty and face-saving are innate to human nature, especially for women. Chinese women are no exception. It is not common for women in Chinese history to pay attention to wearing cool hats. However, among the various customs and habits of different ethnic groups in the country, the general working women all like to wear cool hats, which protect against the heat and facilitate work. Although the materials and styles vary from place to place, the intention is roughly the same. However, it is not entirely true to say that women in ancient times never wore straw hats. Reading Yuan Haowen's poem from the Jin Dynasty, "Watching the peach and plum blossoms wither and fall, I choose more lush branches to insert in the brim of my hat," since there is a hat brim and it is in summer, it can be assumed that it is a cool hat of the straw hat type. It can also be seen that women in ancient times also wore cool hats and inserted flower branches as decorations. The Chinese also value wearing hats as a form of etiquette. Men perform the capping ceremony at the age of twenty, and must wear a hat when going in and out thereafter. Women wear hairpins as fasteners or wrap their heads with headscarves. The Book of Songs says, "With a bun and a cap, and a hairpin sticking out," that is what it means. There were also female Taoists in later generations called female coronalists, which shows that they must wear crowns when going in and out. The Miao people have had cool hats since ancient times, woven from rattan or various soft grasses, all adorned with beautiful decorations, and some with fresh flowers inserted. When going to the market on the third month, men and women in red and green compete in beauty and splendor, wearing various floral hats, which are bright and dazzling, similar to modern European-style women's hats. In the past, Zhuge Wuhou conquered the Southern Barbarians using large rattan hats, which could cover the entire body. Meng Huo's women's army also wore this kind of rattan hat, coated with tung oil, which was difficult for spears and halberds to penetrate, and was very useful. It can be seen that wearing hats is not only a European and American custom, but China has also had the etiquette of wearing hats since ancient times. Noble women mostly wore phoenix crowns and used parasols on carriages, while common people mostly wore straw hats.</p>
<p>Floral Ribbon Wide Brim Hat</p>
<p>Since the Republic of China, everyone, regardless of social status, has worn straw hats. Perhaps because young ladies in the past were deeply in boudoirs and had little need for cool hats, they were not popular. With the progress of the times, girls have broken out of their homes and compete in society. When cyclists drive gracefully through the streets, adding a floral ribbon wide-brimmed straw hat will add a lot of color. They are decorations to be seen on the road and by the swimming pool. I remember that Yu Wen from central Hunan wrote a poem about cool hats that can serve as evidence: "The crown is dignified, and noble etiquette, driving a car and wearing a hat is more people-oriented; a floral-edged cool hat conveniently shields the sun, a hairpin-wearing woman struts through the market."</p>
<h3>Six Dead After Alcohol Factory Explosion - Cause Believed to Be Excessive Heating; Eight Injured Workers Still Unhealed</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "Great Beauty Evening News," an explosion occurred on the 18th at an alcohol factory located at No. 26, Lane 365, North Henan Road. As of today, six workers have died, making it the most tragic industrial accident of the year.</p>
<p>Unlicensed for Hazardous Materials</p>
<p>After investigation, it was confirmed that the factory violated the Municipal Council's regulations for factory management and did not have a hazardous materials license. Previous reports that the explosion was caused by extracting coffee essence from tea were inaccurate. Although equipment for extracting coffee essence was found in the rubble, it had not been used for a long time.</p>
<p>Distiller Explosion</p>
<p>The explosion was actually caused by a distiller capable of holding sixty gallons, used to extract alcohol from sorghum wine. The heating pipe of the distiller seemed to have been damaged, and yesterday, the heat was too high or the work was careless, causing the explosion. With a deafening roar, the distiller was blown off its base, three walls were blown through, and the entire factory building shook. If the firefighters had not arrived to support it, the entire building might have collapsed.</p>
<p>Fourteen Injured</p>
<p>At the time, fourteen workers were injured by the explosion or struck by bricks and tiles. Thirteen of them were still conscious and quickly fled into the back alley, where they were rescued by ambulance staff. The other worker had already collapsed. Five people also died of their injuries yesterday afternoon and evening. The remaining eight workers are still in the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Factory Specializes in Refining Tea Paste</p>
<p>According to Datong News Agency, the incident of the steam boiler explosion that killed and injured fourteen people, as reported in various newspapers yesterday, was investigated by the Datong News Agency reporter with relevant parties, and it was learned that the owner was Yuanyuan Tea Refining Factory, which is a newly established small-scale factory. Because the factory is a joint-stock company, it is managed by a local Zheng. The factory was recently established and specializes in refining tea paste for sale to other ports. Although the machinery it has prepared has been approved for use, it has never been put into operation since it was purchased. The day before yesterday was the first day of operation. When testing the machine, due to the carelessness of the workers, the temperature of the steam boiler was not paid attention to, resulting in an explosion caused by overheating. Four injured workers have been discharged from the hospital. Because most of the shareholders of the factory are not in Shanghai, there is still no proper way to provide compensation.</p>

<h3>Bulls Emerging, Government Bonds Decline</h3>
<p>Government Bonds: In the grey market yesterday, Class C opened, with bulls raising the opening price to 43 yuan. The high opening price led many to sell, and the price dropped by 1 yuan 5 jiao. Investor sentiment weakened, and with Tung Lee selling, the price could not be sustained. All bonds went from high to low, and the market felt increasingly depressed. Rumors spread, and the future is uncertain. Tung Lee sold relatively more yesterday. Hu Heji, Xinji, Wu He, Shun Tai, and Xie Kang were inclined to sell. The buyers, Tong Kang, Tong Yuan, Tong Shun, Jiu Feng, Lian Yi, Run De, Da Kang, and Hong Xing, favored only Class E. As a result, only Class E did not fall, and the rest fell by 6-7 jiao to 1 yuan 5 jiao. Total sales were 3.12 million yuan.

<h3>Yang Stock on Holiday, Chinese Stocks Watchful</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the stock market was increasingly stable, transactions were slow, and investor sentiment was in a wait-and-see mode.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Stock Exchange (衆業公所外股市塲) began its summer holiday on the 15th of this month. During this holiday period, there will be no transactions or market prices for any foreign stocks. However, yesterday, a stock price was 15 yuan.

All are set prices with no transactions. It cannot be regarded as a formal market price of the stock exchange.</p>
<h3>Batch of Qingdao Vermicelli Arrives</h3>
<p>Glass Noodles: Recently, due to fewer customer shipments, the market is tight. Considering production costs, the profit margin is very small, so few sellers are willing to sell. Yesterday, it was heard that a batch of Qingdao vermicelli arrived, priced at 550 yuan, not much lower than the Longkou product, indicating tight conditions.</p>
<h3>First Batch of New Peas Appear; Difficult to Transport, Prices Difficult to Lower; Corn Sells Well, Surging 10 Yuan</h3>
<p>Bean sales were scarce yesterday, and transactions were slow. The market initially rose, then weakened, and prices fluctuated. Tianjin soybeans (60 bags) were priced at 227 yuan to 222 yuan. Jiangbei new peas (40 bags) were priced at 163 yuan. Chongming sand (20 bags) were priced at 115 yuan. Among them, the new peas were the first batch on the market, with acceptable quality, but difficult to transport, making it hard to lower the price.</p>
<p>Corn sales improved yesterday, as more common people eat it to fill their hunger under high cost of living pressures, so the market became brisk again, and prices suddenly rebounded by about 10 yuan. Wuhu corn (1,100 bags) was priced at 126 yuan to 128 yuan self-pickup, and 119 yuan to 135 yuan delivered.</p>
<p>New dried sweet potatoes have gradually arrived, but they are not dry enough and are prone to mold, so sellers' intentions to sell have loosened, and the market has weakened. Yesterday, 60 bags of Jiangbei new dried sweet potatoes were sold, priced at 210 yuan to 214 yuan.</p>
<p>Bran: Hoarders firmly held on to their goods, causing the market to remain firm. Yesterday, 400 bags of Jinxin small-package bran were sold, with warehouse receipts dated April 26 priced at 85 yuan, and warehouse receipts dated June 12 at 86.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Mildewy Rain Affects Cake Sales, Market Initially Rises, Then Weakens</h3>
<p>Bean Cake: Sales were good in the morning, but continuous rain affected transportation, causing the market to weaken. Prices generally rose by about 1 yuan compared to the previous pressing. Erzi bean cake (February new warehouse receipt, 500 pieces) was priced at 58.5 yuan. Four months of new warehouse receipt, 500 pieces at 58.6 yuan.

<p>Red Millet: Arrivals were scarce and sales were brisk, so the market continued to rise. One carload of Mingguang red millet was sold, priced at 103 yuan to 105 yuan.</p>
<h3>Chen Gui Yuan (Dried Longan) Inferior Goods Weaken</h3>
<p>Recently, continued arrivals of older grade Gui Yuan goods that was delayed in transit had been affected by rain, and have some signs of mold. Due to the above reasons, there was a difficult sale, and it was inferior to non-mildewy goods by three hundred yuan, which is because the merchant needs to handpick them to make it profitable for a sale.</p>
<h3>Sugar Stocks Soften</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sugar stocks transactions were lighter, and the trend softened. White Sugar Stock (砂股) initially fell by 1 yuan and 5 jiao, heard at 303 yuan and 5 jiao, then recovered to 305 yuan. However, the result was still soft, closing at 303 yuan, down 2 yuan. Red Sugar Stock at 193 yuan and half, down 1.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>High Metal Prices and Sluggish Sales</h3>
<p>The metal market, affected by the lack of spot goods, is experiencing prosperity and high prices. Many buyers are adopting a wait-and-see approach, inevitably hindering transactions. Enquiries reveal that trading in various goods is not active, and quoted prices are frequently rising.</p>
<p>There is a shortage of both single and double tinplate, as well as various patterned tinplate on the market. Yesterday, merchants were actively seeking supplies. Small metal hardware transactions are also gradually increasing. It has become difficult to purchase entire boxes, and quoted prices are very high. Currently, 90-pound and 100-pound single-layer tinplate are priced at 1,000 yuan per box, while double-layer sheets are priced at 1,100 yuan.</p>
<p>Two-hundred-pound U.S. steel was being searched for in small quantities by canning factories and printing houses yesterday, totaling only about one hundred boxes. Transportation is scheduled for a later date. This is a fixed allocation and must wait for the movement permit to be approved before being transported. However, those in the industry are very astute, and prices are perceived to be quite high, around 1,800 yuan per box.</p>
<h3>Daily Commodity Prices Also Decline</h3>
<p>The purchase prices of daily commodities are being affected by the weakening cigarette market. Various importers, due to excessively high prices, are facing sluggish sales. Consequently, they are taking a wait-and-see approach, leading to idle buying and a inevitable downward trend in prices. Yesterday's market saw prices for brands such as "Guben" soap at 670 yuan, "Baixiangmao" soap at 570 yuan, "Jixiangmao" soap at 460 yuan, and "Arrow Knife" soap at 570 yuan, all down by twenty to thirty yuan. The match market remained stable, with "Phoenix" brand still at 7,500 yuan, "Beautiful" brand at 7,700 yuan, miscellaneous brands at 9,200 yuan, and "Golden Bell" brand at 6,000 yuan. Candles also remained flat, with "White Lishi" at 270 yuan and "Monk's Hat" brand at 260 yuan, showing no significant fluctuations.</p>
<h3>Continued Rumors of Distribution Cause Cigarette Prices to Plunge</h3>
<p>The cigarette market experienced a sharp decline yesterday due to rumors of continued distribution by factories. As a result, businesses were eager to sell off their stock and cover their short positions. Additionally, the continuous rainy weather has made business slow, resulting in very few transactions and a weak market sentiment. Market prices are trending downward. "Great Britain" brand was trading at 17,300 yuan, "Old Knife" brand at 11,000 yuan, down 1,000 yuan from the previous two days. "Brand" was at 9,150 yuan, "Wuhua" brand at 7,900 yuan, and "Fairy" brand at 8,800 yuan, also down by three to four hundred yuan. Prices of Japanese cigarettes are also expected to follow suit. "Golden Gun" brand suddenly returned to the 3,000 yuan mark, at 2,950 yuan, a drop of over 300 yuan. The market later improved slightly, rising to 3,000 yuan. "Golden Building" brand was at 4,700 yuan, "Guide" brand at 3,100 yuan, "Red Rose" brand at 2,750 yuan, "All Luck" brand at 3,950 yuan, and national cigarette "Golden Rat" brand at 4,100 yuan, with "Beautiful" brand at 7,200 yuan, all trending downwards.</p>
<h3>Forsythia Returns to Slackness</h3>
<p>After a rebound, forsythia prices reached a high of 650 yuan in stored securities. However, as stockpiled goods gradually return to the market, prices are softening. Yesterday's market price was 600 yuan, down 50 yuan. There are also rumors of government control, and external lenders are unwilling to hold on for long, so market prices are expected to stabilize temporarily.</p>

<h3>Another Account of Yu Shuyan's Illness</h3>
<p>— Plum Blossom Pavilion Owner</p>
<p>Urethral Obstruction—Incurable</p>
<p>Long Illness—Exhausted Body</p>
<p>Since this newspaper published the news that "Yu Shuyan's illness is serious," opera fans concerned about Mr. Yu have been calling to inquire about the true state of his illness. As I have not corresponded with Mr. Yu for some time, I have no way of knowing his recent condition. However, the "369 Pictorial" recently published in the Peiping edition had a description stating that "After Yu Shuyan recovered from his illness, his spirits were very good, and his student Meng Xiaodong often visited him." Therefore, my short biography of Mr. Yu included the line "He has recently been eating normally." To ensure accuracy, I visited Mr. Wang Dabang yesterday, who had returned to Shanghai from Peiping. (Mr. Wang is the manager of the Peiping Dachang Western Pharmacy and arrived in Shanghai on the 15th of this month.) Mr. Wang has traveled extensively and has considerable contact with people in the theater world, so his information about Mr. Yu is likely to be detailed and reliable. Mr. Wang said: "Before I left Peiping, I met with the two actors Wang Yaoqing and Tan Xiaozeng. According to what Wang Yaoqing knew, although Mr. Yu's illness had improved, his body was extremely weak after treatment, and his urethra was already obstructed. He has to use a rubber tube to pass urine through a small hole, so the mental anguish he suffers is self-evident. As for whether there have been any recent changes, I don't know."</p>
<p>In short, Mr. Yu is suffering from a long illness and has undergone severe treatment, resulting in a decline of his original vitality. Although medicine can treat illness, it cannot cure fate. While I dare not treat the account of his illness as gospel truth, it is still possible. I will inquire with his student, Ms. Meng Xiaodong, to obtain the true situation and report to you readers.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on "Wang Xifeng"</h3>
<p>— Bing Ze</p>
<p>I like "Dream of the Red Chamber," especially Wang Xifeng in "Dream of the Red Chamber." It's not that everyone likes this character, but that I appreciate how vividly and typically the author portrayed her character – selfish, greedy, insidious, and shrewish. On the one hand, she resists the old family’s feudal system with a vengeful attitude. In doing so, she also becomes a henchman of feudalism, ultimately sacrificing herself in vain.</p>
<p>One could also say that Wang Xifeng represents the general traditional women of China over thousands of years. One doesn't necessarily need to say that Cao Yu's "Peking Man" used "Dream of the Red Chamber" as a blueprint in certain places. At the very least, Cao Yu must have thought of this character and been deeply influenced by Wang Xifeng, similarly emphasizing and typifying this kind of Chinese woman.</p>
<p>Based on this, the "Wang Xifeng" on stage is worth noting.</p>
<p>Although the outline of Wang Xifeng's character has already been established, the playwright has adopted a more appropriate approach here, especially in the scenes of poisoning the love scheme and forcing You Erjie to death. The playwright portrays the same cruel and vicious heart through two different attitudes, giving the audience an intuitive understanding. This shows that the author has grasped the core of Wang Xifeng's character, making her both lovable and hateful. Without this, she would easily become commonplace.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, XXXX is originally an actress known for her excellent acting. Now that she has stepped onto the stage, her acting skills are indeed quite refined. However, her speaking skills are relatively weak. Otherwise, the final death scene would be even more powerful. Wu XXX, due to her familiarity with Peking opera, seems somewhat uncoordinated in her movements, similar to Jin Suwen's portrayal of Yang E. However, she worked very hard in the scene where she swallows gold, deeply engaging the audience's emotions. In addition, Sun Qiying, who plays XXXX, and Xia Di, who plays Ping'er, have achieved considerable success.</p>
<p>Overall, performing this play is quite difficult, but "Wang Xifeng" is satisfactory.</p>

<p>Saying Marriage is a Woman’s Only Way Out</p>
<p>Loretta Young is one of Hollywood's most romantic actresses. Some say that she falls in love easily, but it doesn't last. The first man she met was Glenn Hughes, when she was only seventeen. At first, their feelings were very strong, but it didn't last long, supposedly due to a small incident, and they broke up. A few years later, she fell in love with an actor and married him, but soon divorced. Later, due to poor health, she did not dedicate herself to the screen for a period of time. It wasn't until she filmed the sound film "Ramona" that she returned to the film industry. At this time, she seemed to have grown even more beautiful, and many men pursued her day and night with flowers and gifts. She often went out with them, chatting, laughing, and dancing, but her attitude was always aloof. Several years passed, and in the summer of 1940, Hollywood received the special and delightful news that on July 31, the beautiful Loretta Young had committed herself to Tom Lewis before God's altar. The wedding took place at St. Paul's Church in Whistaho Village.</p>
<p>Loretta Young has been in the film industry for sixteen or seventeen years and is a well-known star, having starred in sixty or seventy films. Almost every film has achieved wonderful success. This is partly due to her affectionate, watery, soul-stirring eyes, but mostly due to her personal attention to makeup and costumes, and her dedication to performance, which is why she is so loved by everyone.</p>
<p>Loretta Young's view of life is praiseworthy. She says: "I believe that a woman should find a suitable young man to fall in love with and marry. I believe that two-thirds of a woman's life is spent on her family and her husband and children. This is a woman's only true way out."</p>
<h3>Mei News</h3>
<p>News about Mei Lanfang's whereabouts is of great interest to opera fans, and this publication has also reported on it several times. Yesterday, a friend of his, Mr. XXX, flew from Hong Kong to Shanghai and also mentioned that Mr. Mei is very settled in Hong Kong. His short hair has been styled, making him look younger and more beautiful. He is indeed preparing to come to Shanghai, but there are few XXXs, so he can only wait for XXX to fly over. However, the exact date is still difficult to determine.</p>
<h3>Qiao Qi Fears Shen Min</h3>
<p>— Tao Yuansheng</p>
<p>I met Qiao Qi and his friend at Zhijiang Church. I asked Qiao Qi about his relationship with Shen Min, because it has been rumored for a long time that Qiao Qi is pursuing Shen Min, but why haven't we heard any news of Qiao Qi winning Shen Min over?</p>
<p>Qiao Qi, whose real name is Xu Jiaju, is a graduate of the Sino-French Drama School. He has participated in public performances with the Shanghai Drama Society, Da Zhong, Tian Feng, Shang Yi, and other drama troupes. He has also served as a director for small drama troupes. He is always very diligent and conscientious during rehearsals and performances, so his results are very good and his progress is rapid. He will also perform at the Carlton in early July. Shen Min is a lively young girl, probably about twenty years old this year. She studied at the Faculty of Law and Political Science for a year. She is very good at acting, and if she is willing to work hard, her future is limitless. Qiao Qi must have met her two years ago at the Shanghai Drama Society, right?</p>
<p>It is said that Qiao Qi pursuing Shen Min is acceptable, and Qiao Qi winning over Shen Min is also possible. But Qiao Qi said to me with a sanctimonious air:</p>
<p>"Don't mention Shen Min. I'm really afraid of her. Now I don't even dare to walk with her. Busy bodies always say we're in love when they see me and Shen Min together. God knows! That's not the case. She and XXX (he pointed to his friend, a dark-skinned man from Southeast Asia) are very good!"</p>
<p>I couldn't tell if there was a hint of jealousy in those words, but I do think that busy bodies are indeed too meddlesome, turning a man afraid of a woman for no good reason.</p>
<h3>Showbiz Scenery</h3>
<p>— Xin Juan</p>
<p>The interior scenes of Chen Yan Yan and Liu Qiong's collaboration "Madame Butterfly" have been completed, and the entire film will be finished soon.</p>
<p>Sun Jing's directed "Peach Blossom Hate" has been submitted to the production department to be renamed "Martyrdom."</p>
<p>Wen Yimin's new work "Mother's Heart" (tentative title) will soon begin filming at the old site of Yihua Company.</p>
<p>Gao Zhanfei's scenes in "If We Hadn't Met Before Marriage" have officially begun filming in recent days.</p>
<p>The China Drama Troupe's "Peking Man" will be performed until the 24th, and the evening performances will feature Zhou XXX and Bai XXX's "Dawn Breeze and 残月" until July 2nd.</p>
<p>The China Drama Troupe's "Peking Man" has decided to launch a "Cao Yu Season," performing all of Cao Yu's works, such as "Sunrise," "Thunderstorm," and "Wilderness." To increase audience interest, the company is publicly soliciting ideal actors (actors limited to Zhongyi). If they meet the ideal criteria, the first prize will be a cash reward, and the second to fourth prizes will each be a long-term complimentary ticket.</p>
<h3>"Skylark" Scheduled to Premiere</h3>
<p>Amidst the increasingly fewer Western films being released here, the scheduled premiere of "Skylark" is certainly good news for movie fans. The film stars Claudette Colbert, Ray Milland, and Brian Aherne. Colbert established her high status in comedy with "It Happened One Night," and this film is light, charming, and surpasses "It Happened One Night." It is said that Asian Theater Companies have scheduled this film to premiere at the Majestic Theater, starting tomorrow, Sunday.</p>
<h3>New Variety Troupe Appears</h3>
<p>The singing and dancing of variety troupes were once performed at the Low-Card Hall and were well-received by audiences. It is now reported that a new variety troupe has appeared in Wubao and will perform at the Guangming Theater starting today. The program includes over ten kinds of performances, including Hu Chi dance, Spanish dance, and various novel skills, all of which are extremely famous and exciting.</p>
<h3>International Chess News</h3>
<p>The Chinese-style international chess sold by bookstores is novel and pleasing to the eye, with beautiful paper and Western instructions. Beginners can learn it easily, and it is praised as the ultimate entertainment, so sales are especially good.</p>
<p>Hard to Say in Entertainment</p>
<h3>Kao Shan Tune</h3>
<p>— Ze Fu</p>
<p>The Kao Shan tune is the most popular folk song in the Tianjin area, also known as Shan Luozi (in the North, folk operas and folk songs are both called Luozi), or Tianjin Shi Yao (or Shi Yao, possibly a mistake). It was originally a mountain tune from the fields, hence the name "Kao Shan." Later, it flowed into the cities, and it is now commonly sung in Luozi halls. It is accompanied only by a sanxian, with a slow and circuitous melody, with few connections between words. At the end of each sentence, there is often a very long pause, and the singer often sings loudly, the higher the better, which still retains the original meaning of a mountain song. The lyrics are purely narrative, divided into sections of varying lengths, but before the last sentence of each section, there is always the empty phrase "Ai Ai Ai Ai Yo," which is quite similar to folk songs in other regions. The content of the lyrics is nothing more than love between men and women. Among them, "A Forked Pole" and "A Ball" are the most popular. The so-called "forked pole" is a term used in the North to refer to a prostitute's lover who has the resources to protect her. The lyrics tell the story of a secret meeting between a prostitute and her lover, but there is a lot of local dialect, and it is difficult to understand the meaning without annotations.</p>
<h3>In the Same Boat</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(6) A Snap of the Fingers</p>
<p>Weicheng said: "They're here, what are they talking about?" Cuizhen said: "They talk about everything, the homework in school; clothes, what's fashionable; vegetables, which store is cheaper; movies, which one is new, which one is old (I feel like I'm in a foreign country, I don't understand much of what they say)." Weicheng laughed and asked: "Cuizhen, how is it eating at the Chen's house?" Cuizhen said: "I eat with Miss Chen. I asked Miss Chen, if I hadn't come to Shanghai, would you have eaten alone? She said, she eats with them." Weicheng said: "The food must be very good?" Cuizhen said: "It is. I was thinking, maybe Miss Chen specially told the cook, or maybe she gave the cook a bonus."</p>
<p>Weicheng then said: "After you left, didn't Guofang go to XXX anymore?" Cuizhen said: "She went for two and a half days. I saw that she spent time talking and playing with me, forgetting all about her studies. I felt too uneasy, so I had to come back. Weicheng, how can Miss Chen be so nice? I was thinking, it's possible for a country girl to go to Shanghai and be looked down upon. Meeting Miss Chen, I really wouldn't have dreamed of it." Cuizhen's joy was evident on her face. Weicheng laughed and said: "Miss Chen's kindness is partly because she likes Cuizhen. Cuizhen, you've returned to the countryside now. The impressions of Shanghai must be deeply imprinted in your mind?" Cuizhen said: "I'll never forget it; that foreign XXX, what's it called, French food, you have to use a knife to eat it; and that white cloth, where people can appear and talk; I've seen it all. But Weicheng, the booming sound of the wheels is still in my XXX, and people who grow up in the countryside should stay in the countryside. After living there for a few days, I started to miss the countryside." Cuizhen saw that Weicheng was closing his eyes, as if he was about to doze off, and stood up to leave. Weicheng opened his eyes and smiled: "You talk, I'm listening, I find it very interesting." Cuizhen said: "There's nothing to say today, I'll talk tomorrow. Has my uncle come these past few days?" Weicheng replied without thinking: "No. I believe he should have realized it too, and he won't come anymore." (107)</p>
