<p>〔中央社潘陽廿七日電〕四平下午四時電話，國軍北上援軍，廿七日午已攻克距四平三十公里之泉頭，當晚或廿八日長可抵達四平近郊。又開原下午一時電話，鄭副長官偕廖軍長耀湘，舒副軍長適存，廿七日午乘專軍抵此，稍事休息，即赴前進防地視察。據鄭副長官語記者，泉頭爲共軍據點，國軍一舉攻克，可謂甚大勝利。蓋泉頭，四平間當無何阻力，四平之圍不但迎刃而解，而頑攻之共軍，將必就地殲滅，開原慘遭浩刦，極爲荒凉。</p>
<p>〔本報長春廿七日電〕四平外圍激戰甚烈、共軍大部集結於四平東南。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春廿七日電〕四平共軍主力，廿六日晚負痛向四平西之八面城一帶急竄，其踐波之砲兵團，已於前三日逃出四平外圍，圖以衆勝寡奪取四平之夢想，於付出數萬民兵生命代價後，終成泡影。</p>
<p>〔本報潘陽廿七日電〕東北戰局焦點四平惡戰，現仍繼續中，鐵東國軍天主堂據點，廿六日夜被共軍侵據，他處無恙。此間報載，國軍降落傘部隊自京空運來瀋，由馬師恭司令親自率領，廿六日已有一批降落四平郊區，以助苦守已久之國軍。按：四平市區戰事迄今已十六晝夜。</p>

<h3>于斌主敎論目前局勢　呼籲美經濟援華　勿再蹈珍珠灣事件覆轍</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕于斌主敎廿七日在此間呼籲防止第三次世界大戰之發生，以免人類文化再罹浩刦，其辦法爲美國及早大量援華，渡過當前難關。渠於分析我國目前所謂「內戰」時指出：第三次大戰之序幕，已在我國境內揭開，此際制止尙有可爲，否則將一發而不可收拾。于主敎係於廿七日午邀宴在京之記者數人，席間就當前時局加以評論，渠稱：人謂中共叛亂爲「內亂」，以反中共「內戰」之說，實則內戰，內亂相差無幾，由於東北中共宣有韓共。日俘及蘇籍顧問參加，外蒙軍侵入新疆種種事實，已說明中共叛亂實非「內」亂，而爲「國際戰爭」。渠主張「正名」，謂「名不正則言不順，言不順則事不成」，爲中國之友者，以爲旣屬「內」戰，當俟其變亂過去，再予援助，故美國借款遲遲其來。于氏認爲目前情形與九一八時代相若，渠追述當年曾在珍珠港事件發生前告美國友人謂：日人將襲珍珠港，而美人不悟，結果發生，而不及防，目前似應不再犯過公之錯誤。于氏指出：美國對華之援助，並不足以引起世界大戰，反能消弭世界大戰於未發之前，即使無物質援助，精神支援亦甚必要。于氏認目前之物貿援助，非爲軍火，因目前我國最大難關爲經濟問題，故我亟盼美國之經濟援助，五億　設借款之外，應有幣制借款或物質借款，而美國之力足能大舉援華。于氏於支持孫科之談話後稱：吾人應明告美國，吾人今日作戰，非爲自己作戰，乃爲文化而戰，爲美國而戰。第二次大戰之悲　故事，不應重演於今日。</p>
<h3>傳斯年談時局</h3>
<p>謂蘇聯脾氣古怪</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕參政　（中央研究院歷史研究所所長）傳期年近奉派赴美調查美國各大學漢學研究情况，乘便療疾。傳氏已於昨晨由京抵滬，定明日携眷乘戈登將軍號輪赴美。昨應記者之請，發表時局之意見。渠稱：「中蘇兩國基於地理與世界和平兩種原因，非合作不可，但由於蘇聯奇奇怪怪的性格和脾氣，合作却很困難，頗有越是對他客氣，越是不行之勢」。對孫副主席談話，渠稱：「其動機出於愛國，許多人悶氣鬱在心裏，都需要發洩」。傅氏並認爲「國共之爭因有外力滲入，已非眞正的內戰。目前局勢雖形嚴重，但一般國人未兔過於悲觀，與過去的過於樂觀，同樣不對」。渠表示：「財政經濟問題亟待解決，政府應即調查國人在美存款，統統拿回來，美金債券亦可向富戶　派。總之，中國財政應求之於有錢的人，政府必須痛下決心」。傅氏留美時間，據告，約需半年至一年。</p>
<h3>中共自上至下無不迷信武力</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者詢傅斯年氏對時局之看法，傅氏答謂：「以內部問題而論，政府中使一部份人主張打，而中共則自上至下，均迷信武力，試聽中共之廣播，即可知中共對於時局之看法。今日如有人要求和平者，實應向中共要求。中國之內戰已具有國際性，成爲西班牙式之內戰，惟程度上稍遜一籌而已」。</p>
<h3>平漢北段激戰　察省騎兵馳援</h3>
<p>〔本報保定廿七日電〕保定被圍，保衛戰已激烈展開，四郊戰事九十六小時內砲聲斷續未息，十五華里外據點國重續有放棄，難民紛集城關，迄午砲聲始漸稀。保垣物價上升，麫粉每袋廿萬，全市軍官民昨開緊急會議，計劃總動員，保衛省垣。據綏署副主任宋肯堂稱：察騎兵師刻已南下馳援。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿七日電〕孫連仲廿七日上午召集保綏署在平高級將領會議，孫氏下午赴行轅謁李宗仁，商議增兵平漢北段。　〔本報保定廿七日電〕徐水·漕河間兩軍混戰未已，漕河守軍南撤頭台，徐水城關車站附近頻落砲彈，守軍苦戰激烈，滿城國軍一部東撤，易縣·淶水外圍昨亦傳戰報，昨徐·漕間路軌橋樑被毀至慘。</p>

<h3>共軍軍運頻繁　魯中將有大戰</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南廿七日電〕魯中共軍軍運頻繁，速夜由黃河北岸南運，經靑城，桓台至淄，博及益都，沂水方面，滿載糧彈之卡車，計達五百餘輛，一般判斷，魯中新的大戰，已迫在盾睫。</p>

<h3>立院昨竟日激辯　通過妨害兵役治罪條例等多案　懲罰選舉舞弊案付審查</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕立法院廿七日竟日舉行三二九次例會，由孫科主席。新任吳副院長鐵城首次蒞會。出席立委百餘人，俞大維。陳啓天等部長亦列席。答復有關各該部會問題。會中首先討論郵電加價案，通過後續討論「修正取締達反限價議價條例章案」，由陳啓天詳加說明。後以政府正討論新經濟方案，決議該案保留。</p>
<p>下午討論「修正律師法」時，曾引起有趣爭辯，蓋該案與立委可否出任律師一事，有關各立委發言時，反覆申述理由，不厭其詳，後以立委出任律師終有不妥，該案決重付審查。</p>
<p>「地政部組織法」亦爲會中要案之一，全文廿八條，略加討論即順利通過。惟討論至「修正蒙藏委會及僑務委會組織法」時，則因副委長及會期等點頗多可議處，雖原案通過，然曾引起小風波。另一激辯案件，爲「修正省參議會組織條例案」，夏瀋聲等對省參議會有權審議省經費支出一點，爭執頗烈，呂復亦予支持，最後該案重付審查。繼討論「修正民事訴訟費用法」及「妨害兵役治罪條例」等案，皆順利通過。會中壓軸大戲爲「選舉舞弊懲罰條例草案」，各委員以輕鬆語調發言，衛挺生等對原草案大肆抨擊，劉不同亦以幽默語調加以諷刺。攻擊該案最力者爲新近自選區歸來之衛挺生，衛根據實地經驗，指出在目前情况下，不用請宴方法競選，幾爲不可能之事，即聖賢生於今世，恐亦非採宴會方式不可。衛氏指出各地「大舞弊」情形，據稱我國民衆大多不惟不能書寫被選者姓名，即選舉人自身姓氏亦往往不能書寫，因此凡能控制縣長者，即能當選。某省最近即有因賄選而更掉縣長專員事，與其斤斤於若干流幣之防止，不若防止「大舞弊」為佳。</p>
<p>劉不同以滑稽突梯之口吻，議諷懲罰條例軍案，據稱若根據草案辦理，不能請客，不能供給交通工具，則選舉人非致絕食，立結行動不可。周一志亦稱，人謂本年除水災，旱災而外，尙有所謂「選災」，草案通過後無異平添「選災」。</p>
<p>陳顧遠對劉不同等說法，獨不以為然，說明章案用意在防止有勢力者操縱選舉，有人稱之爲「窮光蛋選舉法」，主旨即在使窮人亦有當選機會。原提案人簡貫三舉英美等民主先進國家法律為例，說明歐美對宴客等情事皆有明文防止，我人提出此案之目的，端正使富者知所警惕，俾窮人在政治上亦有發言機會，不然有錢者固歡天喜地而窮者勢將昏天黑地，立院制定單行法實有其必有以五億元爲選舉資本者，彼等於國際飯店開有長期房間凡支持彼等者，吃喝皆由候選人供給。此種情事及衛挺生所提之大舞弊，應制定法律加以防止。譚惕吾，陳海澄等亦助簡貫三發言，說明草案目的在保護政治上，經濟上之弱者。陳顧遠更指出本屆選舉爲我推行憲政先聲，應於舉辦之初，爲後人樹立一種新風氣。</p>
<p>該案討論約半小時，雙方所爭者僅爲草案規定，瑣屑問題。最後提付表決，決議重付憲法法規委會審查。會議至下午七時許始散，定廿八日再開三三〇次例會。又以積案過多，七月三日將再開會一次。</p>
<p>〔又電〕據參加立院憲法法規委會某立委談。國大職代名額，將有四五〇人，其中自由職業四十九名內，新聞記者佔十二人（其一爲女性）。</p>
<h3>立委今晚上公宴　新任吳副院長</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕新立院副院長吳鐵城，廿七日晨首次出席該院例會，會中周一志建議，由全體立委於廿八日晚公宴，藉表歡迎。此一建議於熱烈掌聲中，獲得全體贊同。</p>
<h3>郵電決加價五倍　七月一日起實施　新聞紙郵資增三倍新聞電二倍</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕郵電加價案，經廿七日立院例會兩小時激辯後，終於通過，定七月一日起實施。郵電均普加五倍，惟新聞紙類郵資增三倍，新聞電費增二倍。以平信爲例，每件由百元增至五百元，以尋常電爲例，每字由二百元增至一千元。</p>
<p>本案今日於院中提出後，首由兼經委會委長樓桐孫說明審查經過，略謂本案係由於政院「改訂國營及公用事業補貼辦法」而來。政府過公對谷項國營事業向採補貼政策，惟因物價高漲，補貼額日見增多，自經濟緊急措施方案頒布後，政府爲平衡預算計，同時又鑒於一切支出不能完全仰仗發行，乃考慮及取消補貼事。政府以前補貼交通事業之費用在千億以上，若全部予以停止，則平信價恐將由每件百元漲至千元，始足彌補，目前交部所提由百元增至五百元，一部份仍賴政府補貼，否則調整數尙不至此。</p>
<p>繼請交長俞大維說明，隨之同來者有郵電司司長陶鳳山等，俞手持滿紙數字之表册，說明自上次調整價格以來，由於兩次調整待遇，每月虧損殊鉅，此次若不調整，則郵電部門，七月份虧損數將達六一四億，故將價格自百元提高至五百，其不足之數，仍由政府補貼，如是郵電二者，七月份虧損額仍將達二百億，（郵政一六一億，電信四十憶）。支出方面，向以薪給爲大宗，佔百分之六十五，裁員結果，電信裁去五千人，郵政裁去四千人，省費不少。</p>
<p>俞氏報告後各立委紛起質詢，盼交部繼續從　節方面努力，以省浪費。程元斟舉出事實，謂交部過於浪費，高級職員住宅由公家代整押費數千萬，此次端陽過節又有種種陋規，皆非必需。王培仁亦認交部若干措施太過考究，手續亦殊麻煩。僉盼能將整個收支情形報告，藉供立法參考。陳顧遠希望對軍人寄信能予優待。</p>
<p>俞氏答詢時稱：此次調整，一方面固爲彌補虧損，然一方面亦爲略事限制，蓋不如此，則信件必將多至無法寄遞。</p>
<p>至是，孫兼院長作補充說明，闡明國營事業漲價不致領導物價上漲。關於取消補貼事，國務會議會兩度討論，若照寄信成本論，每一平信需費千元，如仍照過去百元計，則每寄一信，國庫即須代其繳納九百元，國庫所代納之款一部固由征稅而得，然大部實賴通貨膨脹而來，而負担稅收及因通貨膨脹而吃虧者實爲一般平民。補貼取消後，國庫可少支出七千七百八十二億餘元（就過去半年而論），對穩定物價常爲有效之舉。我人不應恐懼因國營事業漲價而刺激一般物價，我人對於此一足以减少發行平衡預算，減少一般人民負担之舉措，應予支持。</p>
<p>俞等於十一時許退席，院中繼續討論，多數委員對交部種種浪費深表不滿，甚至有主張派人調查者。程元斟舉出二事促起注意。（一）交部開支頗多不合理處，交部對其本身支出，似亦應加以樽節。（二）調整後，快信費每封達一千八百元，在京滬尙無所謂，在內地實足「嚇死多少人」。傅岩亦舉出實例，謂交部一般普通職員，頗多一人雇一僕役，洋房沙法，月費公帑達千萬以上者，如此享受，實難令人不作不平之嗚。</p>
<p>祁志厚譚惕吾等爲交部說話，指出俞氏長交部以來，斷精圖治，不失爲一好部長。我人應　勵其做好事，不可遇事挑剔。陳顧遠亦謂五百元僅够吃一饅頭，尙不足以購一份晚報，似不宜蔪而不子。</p>
<p>最後提付表記，以最大多數通過該案。</p>
<h3>日紡錘保存數目甚多　我紡織業難茍安　專家在東京發出警告</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京廿七日電〕我國紡織專家數人，今晨于接見中央社記者時發出警告稱：我國國內紡織工業，因載後日本被允許保存之紡錘數目甚多，將不能獲得暫時　僞之安全。彼等鄭重稱：國內人民殆已忽視一項事實，即日本紡錘每分鐘可轉動一萬次，而我國紡錘每分鐘僅能轉動六七千次，故白本之產量亦較我國爲多，日本紡織工業之工作亦較我國爲緊張，其紡織工業每日均經常工作廿四小時，日本目下之二百五十萬棉紗紡錘，每日工作十六小時，一年工作三百日，若干人士認爲戰後日本允許保存紡錘四百萬錠，係「完全合理」彼等估計日本每人每年約消費棉布十三平方碼，故二百萬紡錘，須用以生產國內消費之布匹，另二百萬紡錘則用以生產紡織出口布匹，日本戰前有紡錘一千六百五十萬錠，內一千四百五十萬係棉紗紡錘。該國自第一次世界大戰後，紡織工業進步神速，並于一九三三年份代英國而成爲世界第一紡織工業國家，以迄太平洋戰事爆發後爲止。</p>

<h3>我應得日賠償物資　總額迄尙未確定　政院賠償委會負不同意</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿七日電〕行政院賠償委員會負責人答復記者關於「日本優先賠價品，中國何以僅獲得七十八萬噸。我國爲對日作戰之最主要國家，何以僅享如此微薄之配額？政府對此將有何表示？是否將提請重行分配？」等問題稱：（一）日本賠償物資總額，在遠東委員會中，規定爲削低日本戰爭能力，除爲日本人民保留足以維持規定之生活水準之生產量外，其他工業設備均供充陪償之用。目前尙在討論日本究應保留若干生產能力，未得正式結論，故賠償總額尙未有具體規定。（二）各國分配賠償物資之百分比，先後在遠東委員會開會討論數次，迄未獲得協議，惟迄今爲止，各國提出分配百分比，均以我國應得百分比爲最高，其數字自百分之二十三至百分之二十九不等，我國則一，貫要求應得百分之四十，現仍在繼續討論中。（三）先期拆遝之物資，美國鑒於各國分配額之爭執不決，而賠償物資日久銹蝕耗損，故根據遠東委員會授權發布緊急指令，規定在臨時拆遷範圍以內，先撥百分之三十作爲先期賠償拆遷之用，其中我國得百分之十五，其中實際我國已佔先期拆遷物資之半數，較任何其他國家爲多，其百分數之規定，原係用價値計算，惟因一時無法估價，故說明先照「數量」或「生產能力」計算，先付實行，但實際上雖某種機器因其格式之不同，其「數量」與「生產能力」之關係大異，例如新式高速蒸汽透平極輕，而發電能力極高，舊式蒸汽低速蒸汽機極重，而發電能力極小，價値亦復懸殊，故我國應得先期拆遷賠償物資，應佔臨時賠償方案內所開列物資，照價格計算百分之十五，惟爲目前執行敦促起見可照生產能力或噸位先申請拆遷。</p>
<p>總上各節，我國應得賠償物資總額尙未確定，惟我抗戰最久，所受損害最大，就公道標準言，在日本賠償總額中，自應受到最大之此額。在先期拆遷賠償物資內，我國之實際所得數字，可能與依照價値百分之十五所得有出入之處。至一般所傳我國可得七十八萬噸物資一節，似係假定總賠償物資爲五百二十噸，因而計算其百分之十五所得之數。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕我外部為收回澳門事，一年半以來與萄政府不斷交涉接洽，最近並與葡駐華公使掃洽，提出下列問題，請其作答：（一）葡政府對於澳門情勢變遷之原則承認否？（二）葡政府對於合理的民族思想原則承認否？盼葡政府能放棄特權，將澳門歸還我國，惟葡使僅稱：「余現在不能簽覆」。</p>

<h3>聯總緊急建議內容　提供應予攷慮之特殊步驟</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕聯總於數日前公佈關於防止本年七月黃河泛濫應採之緊急措施方案，呼籲有關當局對此嚴重問題加以注意，並採取積極步驟加速進行。（見廿六日本報）</p>
<p>聯總於建議書中曾詳細說明災難之背景，分析目前之危機，建議積極的合作的工作計劃，並就聯總觀點，向政府及中共方面提供應予攷慮之特殊步驟，茲分述如下：</p>
<p>（甲）背景</p>
<p>民國廿七年河南境內黃河河堤潰決，河水泛濫成災，淹沒良田二百萬畝，千萬農民之　舍蕩然，其後遝年戰禍，堤防無法搶修，每屆夏季，重複泛濫，以致河南，安徽，江蘇三省泛區農村無法恢復。聯總研究救濟中國計劃時，即擬導引黃水流入戰前故道，復興泛區，籍使千萬農民重返故園，並設法增加糧食生產，戰前河堤年年培修，惟在敵人佔領時期，河堤漸次侵蝕傾圯，故治黃計劃，必須分爲二部：（A）花園口堵口工程，（B）黃河兩岸復堤工程。其危險部分爲自花園口至入海一段，計長四百英里。</p>
<p>最初計劃擬定堵口復堤兩項工程，同時並進，日寇投降後，始覺另一事業急需舉辦，即民廿七年以後有一二四十萬農民移居河床，建立村莊，阻礙復堤堵口工程，故需將此項難民予以遷移及救濟，其中複雜困難之點，在於堵口工程係在政府控制地區，復堤工程大部在共軍佔領區，當國共談判將告破裂，戰區擴大時，情勢不明，致使運送工作人員及器材土方之搬運至感困難。嗣經行總，水利委員會及中共代表幾經會商，並邀聯總人員參加討論，會議大部在卅五年七月至十一月間，及卅六年一·二·三月間舉行，協議結果：（A）水利委員會負責指撥充份技術監工，物資經費，在國共地區進行復堤工程；（B）行總負責國共地區遷移及救濟河床居民之工作；（C）聯總駐華分署則供給器材及調撥人員，協助復堤救濟工作；（D）共方負責動員工人。卅六年二，三月間，堵口工程進入合龍階段，不幸山東戰區擴大，已非採取特殊措施，復堤工程難有成效，前任聯總駐華分署署長艾格頓，爲此曾特向政府建議、請宣布全黃河河床爲休戰地區，藉使復堤工程，得以順利完成，並要求中共駐滬代表向共方領袖探明對此建議之意見，惟中共未予答復，政府方面則仍由國防部陳參謀總長向有關各地國軍司令長官發佈命令，囑渠等對於黃河地區工作人員不得千擾，並予保議，但共區人民則輕信宣傳，認爲政府堵口引河別有居心，未能合作，近來情况益形惡化，故聯總認爲非採有效步驟，無以防止大汎季節之災患。</p>
<p>（乙）內戰對於復堤工作之限制</p>
<p>由於各項諒解之未能被完全遵守，致救濟物資及行總聯總工作人員，在國共隣接地帶，時遭共軍襲擊，在共區聯總人員則爲共軍刧持，嚴詞盤詰，並常以死威脅，共軍且向聯總人員提出控制物資移充特殊用途之不合理的要求。因戰事阻擾，工作人員之旅行視察，物資之運輸均大受影響，黃河河床及鄰接地帶必須完全休戰六星期，傳急需物資得以輸入否則工程無法完成，桃汛泛濫，無法遏阻，據聯總工程師兼黃河水利委會顧問塔德估計：依照前定償付工款協議，需要運入麵粉五千噸，國幣二百億，共區工程方可完成。</p>
<p>（丙）聯總之建議</p>
<p>爲挽救黃河泛濫成災，當前應採之步驟爲：（一）目前政府與中共之間旣不能旗接商談，則由聯總分別洽商，請雙方立即發佈命令，自六月中旬至七月下句從花園口以下整個黃河沿岸五哩以內停止軍事行動；（二）由國防部參謀總長通令各地方軍事當局，飭令對聯總物資及工作人員，一律保議其安全與通行；（三）緊急供應計劃應即擬訂，核定施行；（四）各有關機構，應即毅然決然分別完成其各屬區內修築河堤之各項應行工作；（五）向當地居民說明此項緊急計劃之重要與意義，並勸導黃河三角洲地帶居民火速遷移，免蹈戰前屢受水災之覆轍；（六）爲求促進並實行上列各項措施，由行總水委會會同聯總各派高級代表數人，組織代表團，視察魯西中共區，以示政府及　總　已決心傾其全力防止黃泛，並藉以獲得共軍負責當局之合作；倘各方均能切實合作，聯總駐華公署準備以全力贊助此項工作，除供給物資，技術人員，救濟工作人員外。並隨時協助調解，藉以推進工作督導工程，挽救浩刦。</p>

<h3>如何應付物價的新蠢動？</h3>
<p>日來物價又見蠢動，如米，麵，雜糧，紗，花，布，油，糖，絲，人造絲，日用品等，皆逐步上升；偶見小回，仍復大漲。此種趨勢，在節前，早爲一般人所料及。其原因，除節關已過，商業轉趨活動外，尙有許多刺激：（一）爲公用事業之貼補取銷，各種水電及票價均將漲價；（二）爲生活指數解凍後，一般工資均見提高；（三）戰區擴大交通愈滯；（四）北方游資來滬者頗多：（五）經監團正式取銷，舫管會亦已改組，經濟上之管制，似已漸見鬆動，（六）銀根雖或鬆或弛，而發行增加之趨勢，並無終止之象；（七）又有舉辦新稅及增加貨物稅等傳說。而同時抑平物價，則除本埠食米之局部配售，食糖之繼續配給，及公敎人員之實物配給，仍照舊辦理外，其他絕無何等新措施可見。</p>
<p>本月二十日，行政院所提經濟改革方案，內容雖極廣博，對於穩定物價一端，且列為第一附件，但其所擬辦法，大都偏重根本上及原則方面，其於治標的及應急方面，反遠不若二月十七日經濟緊急措施方案之嚴厲；緊急方案所定各種平價措施，如議價限價，取締囤積等，是否今後循案繼續推行，新方案內且並未提及，大有一變而爲放任之勢。再衡以公用事業之准許漲價，生活指數之有條件解凍，及進出口連銷制之將趨於明白承認，則以後對於物價之管制，將採取較爲溫和的措施，又覺灼然可見。</p>
<p>抑平物價，雖爲一般人共同的願望，但硬性的高壓辦法，其成效如何？已爲世人所共喻。故物價儘管波動，當局亦儘管宣稱切實制止，而對於過去一般平價辦法之復活或加嚴，則似乎很少爲人所注重。良以物價之上漲，其因素雖極複雜，而要以物資缺乏爲最主要。供求增多，則物價自平，此供求律斷不容破壞。故新方案所擬增加生產各項辦法，雖不免曠日持久，近效難期，而在此物價上騰之時，所可供我們以再檢討的，其資料當仍復不少。</p>
<p>首先値得一提的，爲直接幫助生產各項，例如：改善工業環境，保障工業利潤，以原料供給廠商，工資力求合理化等條款。誠以民之趨利，猶水之就下，但使有利可圖，縱令觸禁犯法，甘冒不韙，猶有人冒險犯難，趨之若騖，何况於正當之生產事業？今生產之所以日就萎縮，與事業家之所以裏足不前，其原因，人人能知之，亦能言之。故工業環境之如何改善？工業利潤如何保障？與原料之如何供給？工資如何合理化？深盼政府卽知卽行，拿出切實的具體辦法，並且拿出勇氣來實行。直接促進生產間接卽所以抑平物價。否則原案所稱安定在業，防止失業，對於現在之生產事業，盡量予以保護等語，依然是空拳誑小兒，斷不能收絲毫實效！</p>
<p>其次爲便利生產事業的，如：透過各種貸款或採定購方式，以促進生產；儘量利用水陸空運輸之便利，以激勵懋遷；採用進出口許可連鎖辦法，以發展進出口之業務；組織復興金融公司，以長期資金，投資於工鑛建設事業；以及調整各種捐稅，簡化稽征手續，以適合現時經濟環境等凡此種種；雖非直接促進生產，而間接皆有助於生產事業之發展。換句話說，現時生產事業之所以未能發展，皆由上項措施未能實行，或相反地遭遇種種反面的阻礙之故。例如貸款一項，新方案內，已明白承認有預扣利息，擅收手續費等不合理方法之存在，而出口結匯之暗虧，與進口外匯之難，已使僑匯逃避，走私猖獗，使正當之進出口貿易，幾陷於停頓。其他若長期融通之困難，征收積弊之深厚，乃至以政治力量，便利私人企業，以致正當之民間工商業皆受摧殘等等，新方案內亦皆坦白承認。此等積弊，倘非採取迅速有效的行動，摧陷廓淸，則生產事業斷難發展，而物價恐將無回落之望。</p>
<p>又其次，爲直接有裨於穩定物價的，例如：以有餘物資，供應都市之需要；出售剩餘物資；實施配給制度；以高利息吸收游資；及如前文所述，以原料供給廠商，採用定購方式等。上述各種方法，如能分別實施，則供給旣充，去路亦活，投機居奇之風，自可逐漸平息。新方案內，亦祇以上數項比較的可收近效，對於平抑物價一端不失爲對症發藥的辦法，或且遠勝於硬性的管制。</p>
<p>此方案旣經行政院擬就提出，且已交付審查，値此物價蠢動之際，我們很希望牠早日有所決定，並將有關生產與物價部分，迅連見諸事實，以期安定生活，安定秩序。我們覺得政府應付這種緊急局勢，似乎太安詳了一些，在太平時代，或許是對的，而目前則應有魄力，有毅力，當機立斷。我們也明明知道這一問題，過於複雜，非單靠一個辦法乃至一個方案所能解決，然而有辦法終勝於無辦法，有方案終勝於無方案。從前的管制辦法，旣經事實證明失效，而當局又存心要改，則不能不期待這個新方案來作桑榆之收。本屆市商會會員大會今日下午卽將舉行各業連名提案，請將是項方案，從速實施，以搶救經濟危機，此亦足見輿情之一斑了。</p>

<h3>主外長在法外交部開會　檢討馬歇爾計劃　歐洲是否分裂面臨考騐</h3>
<p>〔合眾社巴黎廿七日電〕蘇英法外長於廿七日下午四時在法賽外交部開始討論歐洲復興計劃會議之大綱。此次「馬歇爾計劃會議」國務卿雖不出席，而僉認之爲歐洲是否將分為西歐集團與蘇聯集團之最後考慮。</p>
<p>〔合社倫敦廿七日電〕英美二國權威人士今日聲稱：英國官方與美國副細務卿克萊頓本週談判後，業已獲致『性質廣泛之結論」，認爲馬歇爾援歐復興計劃應在聯合國機構以外行之。英外長具文將於今日巴黎三國外長會議中提議在聯合國機構以外另設機構處理其事。比項辦法為計至善，因德國並未參加聯合國機構，但其工業能力實爲任何歐洲復興計劃之一主要基石。聞蘇聯方面主張美國援歐復興計劃應經由聯合爾機構辦理。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿七日電〕法外交部正式宣布：英法蘇三國外長討論馬歇爾援歐計劃之會議，定於星期五晚在法國外交部內正式揚幕。蘇外長莫洛托夫已於今晨抵巴黎，下午即續訪皮社爾。皮氏今晨親自在　石機塲數迎莫洛托夫。明晨員文來巴黎時，皮氏亦將親自至飛機塲歡迎。自美國財長史奈特昨日聲明馬鄉計劃並未允諾對任何歐洲復興計劃從事貸款援助後，巴黎會談之成功，似已極少把握。法外交部某官員對史氏之言表示極度驚異，渠於法國政府須於詳細研究其談話後始能表示意見。巴黎會談係在極罕見之急迫狀態中舉行，貝文皮社爾之迅速邀請以及莫洛托夫之不待決定議程等形式上之手續，即行接受，可證三國外長均希望能迅速成立協議，以適應美國之援助計劃，並使美國國會得於休會或總統競選開始以前，即能採取行動。巴黎會談開始之時，美副國務卿克葉頓亦將在巴黎準備於必要時與任何一位外長舉行面談。同時聯台國歐洲經濟委員會秘書米台爾亦在巴黎，準備於三外長決定利用聯合國機構實行馬歇爾計</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿六日電〕此間負責人士談稱：蘇聯現正信賴美國之言及其計劃，與英法兩國鄭重研究歐洲之復興計劃，俾便提交華盛頓。蘇聯報章對馬歇爾計劃之論調雖多猜忌之詞，但莫洛托去外長已率領代表團八十九人行抵巴黎。法國外交部內所將舉行之三國外長會議，其首要任務即爲草擬此項復興計劃，會議前途自多困難，蓋歐洲每一經濟問題皆有政治關係故也。此項政治問題在莫斯科會議時已曾提出討論，費時七星期，尙不能加以解決，則在此次巴黎會議中，會期僅數日，自亦少解決之希望。要知各項問題皆互有關係，不能討論歐洲問題而不涉及德國，亦不能討論德國之工業而不涉及歐洲之安全問題，肅淸納粹一事亦不能與經濟機構分開討論，情形之複雜，由此可以想見云。</p>
<h3>史奈談談話引起疑慮　杜魯門闡明立場　廓清馬卿與史奈特意見分歧說</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓廿六日電〕杜魯門總統廿六日在記者招待會中聲稱：國務卿馬歇爾與財政部長史奈特兩人對援歐經濟計劃並無任何意見不合，不僅渠與馬歇爾完全同意，此外渠與馬歇爾及史奈特亦完全一致同意。杜魯門此言之意，乃在廓淸外傅馬鄉與史奈特意見分歧之說。緣史奈特廿五日晨曾稱：馬歇爾之計劃，非美國要各國提出其要求援助之謂也。廿五日午後史奈特已表示反悔，並於同日下午在記者招待會中修正其農間所發表之文告。關於美國是否將以金錢或貨物實施馬歇爾計劃，杜魯門答覆記者稱：國務鄉已於廿五日澈</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿六日電〕史奈特之談話，謂馬歇爾計劃並不使美國負有財政援助之義務，發表以後，已引起兩則疑問：（一）整個美國政府是否完全支持馬歇爾在哈佛發表之計劃，歐洲國家是否亦已熱心予以響應。（二）政府是否已因他國對馬歇爾計劃之期望過奢而無窘意。最可靠之意見，對前述第一問題，均有肯定之答覆，然對第二問題，則較難答覆。</p>
<p>馬歇爾昨招待記者時，一記者曾詢以「想馬歇爾計劃意即政府計劃」，馬鄉當答曰然。但今之紐約「垣街日報」則似與馬卿之意見不同。該報謂政府高級官員對於是否宜於實行龐大之馬歇爾計劃，意見已呈分裂。彼等對於給予援助之迫切性，需要援助之數量，聲請貸款之方法，就政治上言是否宜於推行任何需費浩大之計劃以完成進步等點，意見均不能一致。該報認馬歇爾計劃之批准與否，最後決定權當屬諸國會。</p>
<h3>法閣支持皮杜爾討論馬歇爾計劃</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿七日廣播：法內閣於星期五一致通過外長皮杜爾將在三國外長會議推進之政策。</p>
<h3>蘇聯本年豐收　可能影響世界政治</h3>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科廿七日電〕蘇聯自遭納粹侵略以來，今年爲第一次豐收此對莫洛托夫在巴黎討論歐洲復興計劃時大有影響。蘇各地均有豐收之報告，「麵包籃」烏克蘭及白俄羅斯之收獲超過預期者。觀察家認爲蘇聯豐收，將影響世界經濟及政治之發展。（一）若蘇聯能以穀類供給棄歐諸國，則後者即無須向他閱　取援助。（二）因第一點之結果，可使東歐諸國維持獨立之立塲，在討論歐洲復興計劃時，即可採取一致之强硬態度。（三）蘇聯可能以剩餘之穀類輸往西歐及北歐諸國而减少其對美國之依賴，此亦可能包括英國在內（按英國貿易代表團正在蘇京談判購買大宗蘇聯穀類。）（四）蘇聯穀類貿易之發達，又增艱蘇聯本身在世界市塲之經濟地位。</p>
<h3>討論美援歐計劃　南準備參加</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社南斯拉夫京城廿六日電〕南斯拉夫通訊社頃發出消息稱：南斯拉夫政府業已通知英蘇法三國政府，謂南國準備參加關於馬歇爾振歐計劉之初步討認云。</p>
<h3>美大批汽油將運往南韓</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京廿七日電〕據漢城今日宣佈，美國計劃於一九四八年以汽油及燃料大量輸入朝鮮。根據該計劃，美擬於明年以五千四百六十大萬噸之汽油，火油，柴油，及潤滑油與一百一十七萬八千磅個之脂肪及　輸入載　南部。此等物資之輸入，將使朝鮮卡車一萬輛得以轉動，並使朝鮮人二六十萬戶獲得光明。火油將用以供應朝群之少數漁船。</p>
<h3>麥帥論對日和約　主張十八月內務須締結　預料簽約後日本即能舉借外債</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿七日電〕麥帥廿七日下午招待十六位環遊世界之美國記者團稱：無論如何，對日和約必須在十八個月之內締結。渠又表示，如無蘇聯之阻梗，則該約必能在一年內完成，而和約簽字後，渠將立即返美。麥帥稱，對日和約未能早日締結，致使美國日耗金錢一百萬元，在美佔領軍自日本撤退後，聯合國必須有控制日本之能力，否則聯合國對將任何世界事件，必無能爲力突。如聯合國必不能擔負指導日本責任，則惟有請十一國遠東委員會或其中若干國家擔負之。</p>
<p>渠稱：在佔領軍撤退後，日本至少有一代須受非軍事之監視，而日本在一百年內決不能再爲世界和平之威脅。目前面臨美國與世界之重要問題，爲如何復興日本之經濟，助其振興出口貿易。渠又預料在和約簽字後，日本即能借外債。</p>
<p>中日關係</p>
<p>記者詢及中國時局對日本有何影響，麥師答稱，此爲日本之不幸，蓋中日兩國應有正常堅強之經濟聯繫也。麥帥檢討日本國情時稱，軍國主義思想確根深蒂固，戰前七千萬人民受制於一千萬人民，前者之生活與奴隸相差無幾。渠又指出日本之糧食肥料等間題亟須解決。</p>
<p>東亞命運</p>
<p>麥帥之結論稱：日本爲世界舞台之中心，東亞十萬萬人民在數百年內之命運將繫於對日本民主化之努力，如無外力之阻優，美國在日本必能成功。日本民主化之進展非常成功，且在繼續進展中。日本最復之民主，然必爲一良好之民主制度無疑也。</p>
<h3>蘇聯參加三外長會議　美駐英大使表示樂觀　謂各國應消除憎惡心理</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿六日電〕美國駐英大使陶格拉斯於本日午後在此問美國商會致辭，對於蘇聯參加英蘇法三國外長會商馬歇爾援歐計劃之會議，表示樂觀，其言略謂：蘇聯業已決定參加巴黎三國外長會議，並以充分之合作精神共商馬歇爾援歐計劃，此舉當可使吾人之工作簡單化，更使吾人對於三國外長會議之成功，益具信心。各國何以不能共同工作，促成世界大戰災各國之復興，殊無理由可言，但各國若在彼此人民之間煽動恐懼與會憎惡之心理，則決不能完成歐洲之復興工作。余不得不希望各國共同合作，以解決各種問題。以言英美兩國，在國際金融方面實行合作，吾人應共同向前邁進，與懷有同樣崇高心理之國家携手合作，過去如此，今後亦然云。</p>
<h3>關島要求　賠償戰時損失</h3>
<p>預料可得一千萬美元</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿七日電〕軍法處莫德司令今日招待記者稱，關島人民要求賠價戰時損害之數目約爲一千四百萬美元，據美海軍估計，將以一千萬美元作爲賠償。此項損害包括日軍及美軍於爭奪關島時所加之個人傷害，及財產損失，尙有因日軍暴行所致之損害，亦並列在內。</p>
<h3>麥帥顧問艾其森宣稱　日獲經濟援助　美記者稱日人仍有極權思想</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京廿七日電〕盟國管制日本委員會主席即麥帥顧問艾其森，今日在此間美國學校發表演說，相信日本將成爲國際家庭合作之一員。據稱：「吾人曾在麥帥領導與感召之下生活，研究，與工作。麥師爲軍人兼政治家，美國歷史上有數偉人。麥帥之決策乃以秩序對付混亂，麥帥採納之另一種賢明與遠大政第，乃爲禁止干涉普通行政措施，除必要者例外。若干外國報紙認爲此舉形同支持保守派勢力，實爲錯覺，美國將繼續出以有利的影響，而日本將獲得財政與經濟之援助，以便自給自足，余對日本前途樂觀。」</p>
<p>〔聯合社京都廿六日電〕聯合社記者近曾隨同美第一軍團司令伍特洛甫少將廣泛視察佔領區，美軍官方意見一致認爲日本西南部人烟稠密之區改革甚微，必須經由盟國監督數年或三十年之久，始克濟事。據稱，美軍進入日本後，人民已有相當變化，但在本質上尙未與過去極權主義絕綠。美軍如果撤退，日本勢將回到舊主人統治地位。東京方面之管制機關不足提供繼續民主化之保障。甫北兩半部各以農業與工業爲主，若干戰時工廠業　　，以生產農具，顯圖避免賠償。平等與立憲政府對於日本人民爲一陌生觀念，預料僅能緩緩發展。彼等雖亟欲學習美國新思想，但仍牢守舊習俗，遵奉封建階級。</p>
<h3>日又圖覬覦　八重山列島　該島實係我國領土</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿七日電〕自蘆田外相發表希望索還琉球及千島等領土之談話以後，已引起各國之强烈反響。我國中央社所傳上海市參議會以臨時動議，對於日本管理琉球事向政府表示絕對反對一節，此間報紙亦有揭載，惟日本朝野絕不放鬆，報章時見意見發表。此間「世界日報」近日又以「今日之問題」爲題，專論此事，並將本月一一日麥帥織部所發表佔領琉球之報告，全部引用，意欲將蘆田狂妄之企圖，幼實於麥帥總部，董該文曾引一九四六年四月廿二日海軍軍政府（指琉球方面）曾發出第一百五十六號指令，設置冲繩中央政府，且亦曾組織以冲繩土著爲理事之諮詢會議，蘆田及一般日人即據此認爲美國有意將冲繩之行政權交還日人。八重山列島方面，亦由該島知事鼓動該地居民，要求併入沖繩中央政府之下，實則八重山列島與琉球羣島絕不能混爲一談，八重山列島，實爲中國固有領圭之一部份，在此日本歷史學者中承認此項事實者，亦不乏人。至於琉球問題，在開羅會議中已曾論及，想今後對日和平會議中，當有一番爭論。蘆田此時即提出此項問題，想係閱讀麥帥總部之報告後，精神過度緊張所致，而我政府及一般人士，亦正應在此一問題來臨之前，早爲準備，免爲日人所乘也。</p>
<h3>日人帛琉島採礦　澳決提抗議</h3>
<p>日南極捕鯨隊即將出發</p>
<p>〔路透社東京廿六日電〕澳大利亞政府對麥帥總部之准許日本政府接收南大平洋帛琉羣島安加島磷礦之開採，即將提出最嚴重之抗議，該島乃日本委治島嶼中最接近澳洲者。此間某一高級澳洲官員謂麥帥此舉，乃最難令人置信之行動，該官員並指出安加乃國際聯盟之委治島，根本不在麥帥總部職權範圍以內。麥帥總部此一決議，亦並未知照盟國管制委員會。按安加島乃美軍反攻菲列賓之根據地之一。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿六日電〕捕鯨船十五艘由載重一萬一千噸之母船「第一日新丸」率領，即將駛往南冰洋。「第一日新丸」曾參加去年首批南冰洋捕鯨工作。</p>
<h3>蘇聯動員青年　施工業訓練</h3>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科廿六日電〕此間今日發表官報稱：蘇聯最高會議已下令動員大批靑年，凡年至十九歲之男子，皆須受煤礦與重工業工作之勞工後備力量。按以前所規定之最高年齡爲十七歲，今則提高爲十九歲，其最低年齡或將定爲十五歲。此外，十四歲至十七歲之男童，及十五歲至十六歲之女童，則將入商業與鐵路學校受訓，估計實行此項措施後，本年可增加四十二萬五千萬男女兒童受此訓練。</p>
<h3>荷印風雲險惡　沙利被迫辭職　印尼區華僑奉命移居</h3>
<p>〔路透社喬克加卡泰廿七日電〕沙利辭職後，印尼共和國總統索卡諾業已接受總統之全權，以應付政府危機。索卡諾今日已在親自章具對荷方最近所提補充備忘錄之答覆，內容雖不可知，但可靠方面相信，將拒絕沙利爾近已承認荷印總督　莫克在臨時聯邦政府中之法律上之地位，並建議雖使葺范莫克為該政府之一員，但不具表決之權。</p>
<p>〔聯合社印尼首府廿七日電〕印尼共和國總統索卡諾今日接受總理沙利之辭呈後，即掌握政府大權。沙氏因政見不合，　因閣通宵會議中提出辭呈，當　接受。總統飭舊閣員暫時留任，以待新內閣組織成立。沙氏下野之日，印尼各政黨正團結一致，反對其對荷蘭讓步避免武力衝突政策。索卡諾定於今日答復荷蘭最後照會，反對繼續讓步。據總統左右稱，沙氏將留任代理外長，以待新閣成立。中立觀察家認爲沙利內閣之垮台，象徵印尼溫和派之失敗，預示印尼與荷蘭談判之破裂，可能引起軍事行動之後果此間荷蘭官方今日對於沙利之辭職，未表示意見，印尼發言人則謂，「僅有奇績能挽救印尼軍與荷蘭軍武力衝突」。</p>

<p>〔合衆社成功湖廿六日電〕希臘在安理會關於巴爾幹問題達最後決定之時，突於廿六日提出一驚人動議，攻擊南斯拉夫，保加利亞，及阿爾巴尼亞三國，作國際侵略。希臘此項攻擊，根據憲章，可能爲情形最嚴重者。西方各國或許對希臘之北方三鄰國，將採取較諸預期之抨擊行動更進一步之措施。英美兩國可能預先接獲希臘採取此項行動之通告，並對此贊同，將之作爲安理會之辯論程序。希臘之控訴，如大多數國家通過以及蘇聯不使用否決權，則可將安理會之三巴爾幹國家之辯訴擊敗，惟蘇聯或將使用否決權，以打消此項嚴峻之動議。</p>

<h3>解除數萬戶住的恐慌　受配房屋租賃權　參議會堅主延長　決定處理原則昨函市府地院</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會爲本市房荒嚴重，經第一屆第二次大會決議解決辦法，復於日前由該會地政委員會審查結果，決定處理原則五項，昨日特分函市政府及地院、請依照市參議會決議，延長受被分配房屋住戶之租借權，以免引起械種　擾。茲將市參議會致地院公函中陳述之理由曁辦法探錄於後：</p>
<p>甲，理由：查本會一屆二次大會中，因本市房荒嚴重，行政院原定統一承租辦法一且屆滿，業主勢必藉口收回，原來受配居住之機關團體及軍公敎人員自必無法他遷，因而引起社會不寗，故曾通過延長統一承租期限，經送請政府查照辦理在案。惟本市業主對於本會議決能遵照辦理者，固不乏人，但藉口統一承租期滿，而企圖另行出租者亦所在而有，甚至雖經政府合法分配，而始終拒絕訂租者更比比皆是。因而糾紛迭起，殊非本市之福。且查勝利之後、政府機關在滬負責接收分配敵僞原租賃房屋者，計有日僑管理處，三方面軍，蘇浙皖區敵僞產業處理局，上海市政府物資接管處，及行政院分配上海各機關房屋委員會等五機關之多。當時被分配機關團體或軍公敎人員，凡經合法分配進入居住者，爲數富在數萬戶之多，若令其一旦遷讓，試問此輩人民在此房荒嚴重聲中，其將何以托足。查政府接收敵僞原租賃房屋，原爲抗戰八年之勝利成果，所接收者爲敵僞之租售權，其與業主商權，根本無牴觸。本會旣爲地方民意機關，對此嚴重問題，亟應再予決定方案，以貫澈上屆大會決議之威信。</p>
<p>乙，辦法：（一）由本會再度聲明，凡經政府機關合法分配之房屋，受分配人，執有正式分配證者，業主均應與之訂約，否則即爲放棄租賃之收益權，不准訟爭。（二）統一承租期限雖已屆滿，受分配房客如無欠租行爲或其他遠法情事者，業主仍應繼續租與受分配人，他人不得妄爭。（三）所有敵僞原租房屋之租賃權（債權），不能與業主產權（物權）相混，并作一談，而爲主張。規住戶旣經政府予以合法分配，則其居住使用之租　權，顯已由政府給予現住戶，業經取很債權，業主即不得另租他人。（四）本會函請司法機關注意有關政府機關合法分配之房屋訴訟，并愼重判決，以免利用法院，增加糾紛。如規住戶并無欠租或違法情事，而被業主以另有租約爲理由訴請遷讓者，請予斟酌民法第七十一及七十二條，并根據本曾歷次決議，推定其契約爲無效，予以駁回。尤請注意假執行之聲請，其因集主拒訂租約而現在住戶無法履行付租之義務者，准許現住戶向法院提存。（五）凡經合法分配而經業主訴請遷讓，并已由初審判決遷讓者，應請司法機關在上訴審時予以適當之救濟。</p>
<h3>公用事業再漲一倍</h3>

<p>〔又訊〕自經濟偵察工作由市府負責辦理以後，市府鑒於最近本市物價又起波動，爲制裁投機，穩定物價起見，昨日舉行之市政會議，對此問題曾作詳盡具體之研討。據悉，該會於原則上已決定組織一「經濟檢查會報」，由市府秘書長沈宗濂主持，參加機關爲警察局，警備部，中央銀行，財政部，經濟部，及其他有關機關之代表等。該會議將爲本市經偵工作之最高會議，由各單位分別供給情報，而由市府交警局單獨執行，以免流弊。</p>

<h3>各區貧戶配米　撥配數量核定　今日起辦理領米手續</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕六月份貧戶配米，因各區區公所調查之貧民人數多遲遲尙未呈報，民食調配委員會乃即根據谷區人口比例及貧瘠差別，核定撥配各區貧戶配米數量，總計全市卅區共六萬零四百担。調配會即於今日開始通知各區區公所辦理領米等手續，七月初旬可開始發售。各區核定撥配數量如下：黃浦區六五〇石，老閘區七〇〇石，邑廟區三〇五〇石，蓬萊區三八〇〇石，嵩山區五三一〇石，盧家灣區二〇四〇石，常熟區二三六〇石，徐家匯區一三〇〇石，長寗區三二〇〇石，靜安區三五〇石，新成區三六〇〇石，江寗區一三八〇石，普陀區二八一〇石，閘北區二六九〇石，北站區三六一〇石，虹口區二三六〇石，北四川路區一四一〇石，提籃橋区三六〇〇石，榆林區二四六〇石，楊樹浦區一三七〇石，新市街區八三〇石，江灣區六三〇石，吳淞區六二〇石，大塲區八三〇石，新涇區一五八〇石，龍華區二一四〇石，楊思區一二九〇石，洋涇區三五〇〇石，高橋區二〇〇石，眞茹區七三〇石。</p>

<p>該項貧戶配米因出倉及運送至郊區等手續需費甚鉅，由何人墊款頗成問題，調配會已電呈糧食部請示。昨據吳主任委員開光稱：貧戶配米爲碎米，以每石價十六萬八千元計算。其運費等可由區公所暫墊，出售時再加運費。因各區遠近不同而運費有別，故配米售價各區或稍有差別。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市被捕學生家屬，自根據提審法聲請高院予以提審後，社會方面對此極爲注意。據高院某高級人士稱：高院對此，極爲愼重，幾經考慮後，以該案案情頗爲複雜，是否適用提審法，於二十四小時以內提審，殊難決定，乃採取一項折衷辦法，昨日致函滬市府，請將該案予以調査，曁被捕學生所犯罪行，是否具備提審條件，俟市府函覆後，始能對各該生家屬之聲請予以栽定。並聞如係內亂罪，則尙須經高檢處偵査，如係普通刑事亦須經地檢處偵查，本市某報所載之定期提審消息，殊非事實云。</p>

<h3>星島征星第三戰　五比三力挫星聯</h3>
<p>〔本報星洲航訊〕星鳥游歐第二征站，依原定計劃，在星洲挑戰，該隊自抵星後，首戰三比三被星華聯隊迫和，次役即發奮揚咸，以五比一打走軍聯，第三遭遇戰，會師全星聯隊，虎隊在三軍用命下，五比三再傳捷報。　事實上，星聯相當驃悍，前鋒三虎將尤有出色技術，左面兩將謝文良和何亞益，演出更妙，惜全軍未够鎭靜，前半時雖龍保持一比一和局，後半時却無法支持，終於敗陣。</p>
<p>星島前鋒以馮景祥，朱永强打得最好，後衛許竟成和候榕生也見功夫，虎隊是戰以新編陣容上陣，且看雙方如何點將：</p>
<p>星島</p>
<p>劉天申　余耀德　候榕生　馮坤勝　許竟成　宋靈聖　劉松生　黎兆榮　朱永強　馮景祥　高山龍</p>
<p>星洲聯隊</p>
<p>童勃　盧特　拉受　夏女夫　哇斯　李絲末　何亞益　謝文良　卓振玉　康珊瑟　沙馬當</p>
<p>聯軍先勝</p>
<p>銀笛響過，聯隊興師迫陣，天申殺退來敵，沙馬當射門落荒。三分鐘後，景祥領軍反攻，兆榮低射被接，高山龍猛蹴落空，只是凑凑熱閙。聯隊再急攻，文良匹馬進兵，騙過榕生，將球撤出，振王趁勢就射，余耀德摸不着球兒，只好讓聯軍先報勝利。</p>
<p>各一平手</p>
<p>文良再來，亞益射斜，耀德却嚇了一慌。跟着虎隊反擊，永强盤球邊綫，眼看敵衛追得緊，舉脚傳中，景祥眼快，奔前接應，十碼處，横掃一脚，球淸脆入網，一比一，小休前，雙方苦戰，保持均等局勢。</p>
<p>五三結束</p>
<p>易陣再戰，星島攻勢甚盛，永强松生先後建功，以三比一領前。九分鐘，「神腿」單騎飛進，騙過守門，撥球入網，成四比一，惹得全塲球迷呌好。聯軍經此挫折後，傾師推進，十五分鐘時，左翼乘榕生天申誤會間，衝進一球，扳回四比二。到最後十分鐘間，永强再替星島立功，文良却在亂軍中反身抽球入網，各加一隻，五比三終塲，聯軍敗陣。</p>

<h3>惠勃爾登男子單打　僅除最後十六人　種子選手全部入第四週</h3>
<p>〔合衆社惠勃爾登廿六日電〕惠勃爾登網球賽，男子單打晋入第四週，最受歡迎最有希望的選手，已戰成最後之十六人，計：美國四人，澳洲四人，法國三人，捷克一人，阿根廷一人，奧地科一人，瑞典一人，紐西蘭一人。今日觀衆空前擁擠，統計約二萬四千人。種子選手俱未發生意外，大半皆以直落三得勝。今日天時奇熱，高至八十五度，與「加州好天氣」相似，美國四選手克拉茂，湯姆勃朗，福爾根堡，及貝蒂，皆獲勝利，全部僅失落二盤。福爾根堡在第四週中，將與奧國獨臂大將貝特相遇，如能得勝，則半複賽週將與澳洲第二名選手配爾斯相逢，此戰為福氏最重大之試騐。</p>
<p>〔路透社惠勃爾登廿六日電〕惠勃爾登網球賽，今日並無重大意外發生，但在熱浪之下，若干組競爭頗爲劇烈”汗如雨下。全部種子選手皆進入最後之十六人。男子單打，漸成美澳爭雄之局面，有如台杯之部令治賽。法國在上屆冠軍員脫拉領導下，尙有三代表。最後十六人中並無一英人在內，表示英國網球水準之低落。八個種子選手七個皆直落三得勝，僅湯姆勃朗以四盤勝英國前初級冠軍巴克斯德，六—二，六—二，十—十二，六—四。克拉茂勝義大利哥塞里，六—〇，六—二，六—〇。澳洲勃朗維區，爲克拉茂之主要勁敵，表演最完美之技術，以六—一，六—一，六—一勝法國台斯脫拉摩。勃氏有時以落地球回繫對方之開球，其精彩有如此。澳洲喬夫勃朗勝英國茂拉地斯，六—二，六—一，六—三，全賽僅費四十分鐘。美國六呎長人勝英國狄斯登，七—五五，六—三，六—一。瑞典第一名選手約翰生勝匈牙利阿斯巴許，八—六，五—七，六—二，六—二。印度三選手全部淘汰，左手將軍阿默特苦戰敗於法國亞特塞倫，九—七，六—四，七—九，四—六，六—四。鮑斯敗於貝脫拉，六—三，六—四，六—四。印度冠軍密斯拉敗於貝爾斯直落三。</p>

<h3>乒乓聯賽總決第一戰　滬星擊退華聯華　演出緊張結果五比二</h3>
<p>二屆上海乒乓聯賽總決第一戰，前晚八時，在横浜橋中央大會堂揭幕，愛好乒乓觀衆，計達六百餘人，情况熱烈，裁判沈柏鴻，陳霖笙，發令開賽，出塲爭鋒者爲一部冠軍滬星對抗二部亞軍華聯華，華聯抱必輸之心應戰，淮演出反形緊張，李飛　於五局劇戰後，反敗爲勝，險勝滬星新將黄滋淞，殊屬不易。老將周維新之短檔，擊來出神入化，使對方左手硬抽程愛心，幾有手忙足亂之槪，而一時竟無從還擊之機會，前者以直落三輕取程愛心，大有人老寳刀不老之慨。滬星全村宿將李宗沛缺席，抽手王昌厚病體初愈，亦未下塲，實力影響不少，終賴傳其芳薛緒初兪誠三大將之奏捷，黄高遠黄志鈞之建功，卒以五對二擊退聯華，以此戰績觀之，未見出色，前途勁敵正多，滬星苟不努力，恐將有遭遇冷門之危。今日無比賽，明晚（二十九日）由三部冠軍華聯與亞軍郵乙重逢。茲錄首戰總決成繼如下：</p>
<p>（滬星）　（華聯華）（比數）</p>
<p>俞誠　顧錦祥　三—一</p>
<p>傅其芳　徐芝福　三—〇</p>
<p>薛緒初　劉保泰　三—一</p>
<p>程愛心　周維新　〇—三</p>
<p>黃高遠　陸雲章　三—〇</p>
<p>黃志鈞　秦裕珩　三—一</p>
<h3>銀錢盃乒乓賽中國甲勝上信</h3>
<p>首屆銀錢盃乒乓賽，前晚四塲角逐，錢組稱子中國甲乘征杭全勝之餘威，以十三對三大敗上信，老將竺永康與削手袁鏡允二將之技術，發揮無遺，無異爲中國甲之靈魂。其他各戰，金城浙興實力堅銳，俱傳捷報，惟銀組大裕，首陣即吿棄權，精神殊屬不佳，對方交通不勞而獲，跋涉一趟，甚覺掃興。今日因行莊結賬關係，暫停一週，次週秩序另行公佈。茲錄前晚結果如下。</p>
<p>中國甲勝上信（錢組）十三—三</p>
<p>金城勝中央乙（業組）十三—五</p>
<p>浙與勝四明乙（錢組）十三—二</p>

<h3>現棉市況平疲</h3>
<p>昨市現棉市况，因棉紗已回，人心虛軟，紗廠納胃甚懈，客戶均有賣出，去銷呆化，脚地頓呈疲軟。上午交易供多求少，喊價稍降，但各方納胃極微，成交寥寥。午後因港申電匯較上午稍長，人心稍定，紗廠略有吸胃，客帮起而添辦，同業亦互有抵補，市價站穩。惟市上銀根又緊，成交不旺，各檔做開送廠價計　　米特林一八〇萬，　米特林一八〇尤，雲寶二二〇萬至二二二萬，陳平果爾一二七萬，又棧交價計山東木架一七五萬，通州一六七萬，九江粗絨一四〇萬，太食一六〇萬，火機一五〇萬，周浦籽花每組二七萬至二九萬。</p>

<h3>紗價回跌</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因速日上漲過互，當局將澈査各紗商帳册及倉庫，人心頓起恐慌，業外浮多，紛紛斬售，市勢遂告劇瀉。十一時後，復以匯市續縮，檯面更虛，賣氣甚濃。廿支雙馬紗挫進千萬大關，最後爲九百九十五萬，比上日猛瀉六十五萬元，四十二支藍鳳劇降一百七十萬元，爲一千七百八十萬元。其餘廿支特雙馬十六支光明及一二十二支等粗細紗俱跌六七十萬至百萬元左右。</p>

<h3>新人新政</h3>
<p>— 台灣解決失業對策　台北二十三日航訊　本報特派員江雲</p>
<p>二二八給台灣的執政者提供了新的事實的敎訓，就是從遠取得安定，在安定中求進步，求繁榮。安定中最大的着眼點，就是對失業的）救濟。</p>
<p>台灣同胞愛以日本時代打擊，一般最不滿政府而也作爲省人攻擊的稽口的，就是生業問題。可是台灣道海島，究竟有多少失業者，這個準確的數字很難求的。失望者圖於日人統治時的習慣，調査時誤爲微發致袖手不前或故意違避，參議會有解決失業的提案，而沒有統計的報吿。各級地方政府所能提供的數字，又不盡準確，結果迫使民政廳不得不作再調査。事實上，從海外和內地返省的台胞十二萬人中，多數原無職業，現在要給予就業者至少佔二分之一，合以各階層的眞正的失業技工估計，約在六萬至八萬人左右。這些大部是年青人，在省外站不住脚而抱着滿腔熱忱在和平之後的一年中，陸續省返的。</p>
<p>這些失業者，忍受不住物價的高壓，雖向政府要求從速得業，可是政府不能輕便地給他們安排，乃遭致了影響治安擾亂社會秩序的結果。目前當局正循着解決的路綫走，這是新人新政，人們都將寄予期待。</p>
<p>公地放租　可容十四萬人</p>
<p>民政廳朱廳長佛定，提供了具體而實際的計劃，即將交省府會議通過施行。主要的是公地放租（限田），包括：（一）糖業公司所劃出的自營農田二萬甲（合二十八萬畝），以一甲作一戶，每戶六人，可以容納二萬戶，十二萬人。（二）有十九個日人徵用的飛機塲已決定劃歸民用，可容納七千人。（三）其他鳳梨，合拓等公司機關土地可能劃出放租和安置雇農，可容二三三一戶，每戶六人，合計一三九八六人，以上合計十四萬人。</p>
<p>政府決定可能帮助的預算，是設備經營費八億元，（內房屋，農具及每戶生活費三一四二八四元）這筆經費並不影響省預算，而是在整理公地所得租息中提撥的</p>
<p>移民墾荒　需用十二萬人</p>
<p>墾荒是艱苦的工作，在解決失一業問題之同時，也具有增加生產疏散都市過剩人口的意義。台省有可墾荒地十三萬甲（合二六〇萬畝）包括草原地，荒廢山地，沙質地，斥鹵地。據調査今年可以放租的，有二萬四千甲，準備四年之內勘測完畢，可容二十餘萬戶，十二萬二千五百人。</p>
<p>墾荒不是「搶沙田」，它需要計劃，需要鼓勵，保障，更需要作爲施政的重點來看的。正因爲這樣，政府需要有一筆龐大的經費建築公共宿舍，供給農具，添置生產用具，事業費，估計需費台幣二十一億七千二百二十三萬元。</p>
<p>經費來源是三十五年度公地租金收益，無斷（非法）開墾，整理地目後增加的收益，合作農塲和日產標售提撥以及土地銀行的貸款。</p>
<p>墾荒期限規定三年，免收田賦五年。有一個專門管理的機關，縣府下將設督墾室，負責指導和監督。</p>
<p>日本人到現在還不曾忘記「移民」合灣的「特」權，現在我們就得將過去日人的移民村好好地利用起來，運營起來。</p>
<p>大工程隊　在我國是創舉</p>
<p>陳儀離台時，留給魏主席一件待完成的工作，是安插失業工人，組成數萬人的工程隊，從事於大規模的建設。這個救濟失業的方案，是根據羅斯福的人們指摘爲：“Splenting　Policy”的政策，即是展開大規棋的公共工程，來救濟大批的失業技工。這個計劃由前公共工程局長費　提出費陳儀長官準備要付諸實行，而省府改組使他移交給後任。</p>
<p>建設廳長楊家瑜爲這失　問題，也在焦思苦慮。他希望工程公司吳總經理文喜提供具體的實施綱領。吳總經理是絕不主張由軍隊管理大規模的工程隊的。他主張在集中工程地點，採取包工制，在部分工程處，則採用分包制，希望在不糜費下實行這個劃時期的救濟計劃，更不希望工人多於工程師，政府的支付多於工人的實益。</p>
<p>目前工程公司正展開着以儲有本年度蔗糖產量四十萬噸的倉庫工程，此項倉庫遍及全省，需用急，數量大，預計年終完工。所需動員的直接工人約一六二萬五千人，其中技術工約佔七〇％，計九千五百人，普通工約三〇％，計四千人。間接所需工人，約十四萬八千人。其中技術工僅一千五百人，普通工則佔八千六十人，合計直接間接所需技工約一萬一千人，普通工一萬二千六十人。在散處全省的倉庫工程，爲顧及工程本身進展與救濟失業工人計，仍採用分包制。由倉庫工程委員會根據各縣市的失業工人數及工作技能，統籌支配於承包人雇用，合理評定其工資。對於有能力的失業工人，將由承包者搜羅爲基本工人，不致因工作完成後復遺失業。</p>
<p>大工程隊的組成，在中國是創舉，而在台灣這些失業工人者的集中管理和經費，都是直得考慮的問題。</p>
<p>失業者羣　具有安定力量</p>
<p>做一個台省同胞是幸福的，道個幸福是八年抗戰所賜予的。在遍地烽火到處不安的內地，求生不易，　論建設，可是這裏却積極從事於復興建設。民衆有所要求，政府總想法解決；政府所不能辦到的事，總希望民衆理解。</p>
<p>解決失業問題，是台灣失業者羣給予新的省府底試鍊。我們不該當作僅是一件理論上的事，而須看作付予堅强毅力的鉅工。當局需要鄭重將事，民衆也須踴躍參加；尤其是失業者本身，更需瞭解具有安定社會秩序的決定力量。</p>
<p>民生主義的實現，不只是響亮的口號，而是針對現實身體力行的對策。</p>

<h3>今日的郵政</h3>
<p>— 湯錫椿</p>
<p>我國郵政，向採「以郵養郵」政策，即以郵政收入維特郵政支出，戰前物價穩定，郵政堪能自給自足，抗戰以來，物價高漲，運輸費用及業務開支等，均隨物價激增，而郵資增加，速落在物價之後，致郵政經濟，虧損數字，與日俱增，計三十年虧損四千五百萬元，三十一年虧損一億四千五百萬元，三十二年虧損七千二百萬元，三十三年虧損七億一千五百萬元，三十四年虧損七十四億八千八百萬元，三十五年虧損八百六十二億九千萬元，本年一月至五月虧損估計約在九百億元左右，雖政府有部份貼補，而每月虧損數字仍極驚人，分析虧損原因，約有下列幾方面。</p>
<p>（一）物價高漲支出激增：郵政收入受郵資限制之影響，未能及時增加，而郵政支出，則隨物價的汹湧拜騰，隨時增高，諸如郵件運輸費用，業務設備費用，以及一切行政開支，無不隨物價之高漲而遞增，如目前每封平信郵資爲國幣一百元，而每枚郵票之印刷成本已達三十八元，倘一封平信貼二枚郵票，則郵票本身成太已爲七十六元，若在郵政代辦所交寄，尙須扣除代辦所手續費，所餘絕對不數一封信運輸寄遞成本，又如寄遞新聞紙，每束納費僅國幣十元，購貼郵票一枚之印刷成本則爲三十八元，如不貼郵票免費寄遞，反可少虧損成本二十八元，估可郵局對於寄遞新聞紙一項，每月虧損在國幣四十億元以上，其他印刷品及書籍等寄遞，虧損更大。</p>
<p>（二）郵資過低加價太遲：現在一般物價較戰前漲二萬餘倍，郵資以戰前一封平信五分與今日一封平信一百元計算，僅增加二千倍，增加倍數旣不能與物價成比例，而加價時間又遠落在物價之後，如三十四年十月一日起平信一封由二元增為二十元，至去年十一月一日始再增寫一百元，以迄於今，未有變動，而物價則瞬息萬變，以目前二千倍的收入，負担二萬多倍的支出，當然祇有虧損。</p>
<p>（三）包裹業務衰落信件數量增加。戰前交通暢通，商業發選，郵政每年收寄句裹在九百萬件以上，故包憂業務收入之向爲郵政收入大宗，現則國內戰亂不已，交通阻滯，包裹業務，無法發展，三十五年度收寄包裹僅七十四萬件，爲戰前十三分之一，業務　落千丈，而信件却以郵資低廉，收寄數業與日俱增，尤以掛號信件與快遞信件爲最，民國二十五年每月平均收寄信件爲七三，四七三，〇〇〇件，本年三月已增爲九四，〇四六，〇〇〇件，因郵資低廉，不數成本，故信件愈增加，虧損亦愈大。</p>
<p>郵政經濟之不能維持，略如上述，如何彌補，以資挹注，確爲當務之急，如果政府經營郵政是以便利人民爲目的的，便不應計算成本，所有郵政的虧損全部該由政府貼補，以達到「穩」，「快」，「康」的目標，如果郵政的經營係採「以郵養郵」政策，則郵資的釐訂，最低限度應勉數成本，使這服務羣衆的業務機構能繼織維持和改進，執捨孰取，當局應有明確之決定，決不可游移於二者之間，補貼旣不够，加價又不足，形成目前不死不活的局面。</p>
<p>以往郵權權操在外人手裏，不論人事行政，經濟支配，完全是獨立的，北伐以後，郵政雖正式歸入交通行政系統，但多年以來，當局對郵政還是一貫的採用「以郵養郵」政策，郵政的收支盈虧，究全由郵政自行解決，盈餘時即以多餘的款項改進業務，虧損時消極辦法是力求緊縮，裁員减政，以節開支，積極辦法是增加郵資，以資挹注，或者消極辦法和積極辦法二者兼用，總之自己的困難，自己解決，不必仰求政府，人事行政亦自成一獨立系統，不容一個未經考試的人入局，亦不容一個違法舞弊的人在職，過去郵政的光榮歷史，完全建築在這經濟獨立與人事行政獨立的政策上，但自抗戰以來，因物價的激烈變動，郵資加價受稱種限制，郵政經濟不能自行支配，致陷於艱難絕境，在此情况下，而郵政仍能力求改進，最近南京上海等地有示範郵局，通宵郵局，汽車行動郵局等設施，同時儘量利用航空載運普通郵件，添設火車行動郵局，日夜工作，本地郵件當日投遞等，凡此種種。或爲改進服務，或爲加連郵遞，無不予人民以極大便利。</p>
<p>我國自勝利以來，因政治間題未有合理解決，一切均呈紛亂局面，今日國營事業中，比較可以値得稱道的，殆惟郵政一項，而今郵政亦在經濟極度艱難中掙扎，雖賴優良人事制度精神之不斷發揚，尙能勉求改進，然巧婦難爲無米之炊，勞亦不能維持久畏，郵政爲一服務羣衆之必需機構，不能一日沒有郵政，對當前郵政面臨之經濟危機，我們不可坐視，希望政府速籌有效補救辦法，以維持其服務機能，使此具有五十年光榮歷史之事業，繼續創造更光輝之前途。</p>
<h3>為空軍生力部隊而歌唱　記筧橋軍校復校週年紀念大會</h3>
<p>— 杭州廿五日快訊　本報特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>中國空軍的搖籃——筧橋空軍軍官學校，在她復校週年的紀念大會上，連帶舉行了該校第二十四期學生的畢業典禮，那是一個莊嚴活潑的場面，留在每個人的腦筋裏是無比的愉快。</p>
<p>二十四期的學生，是在我們抗戰到最後，最艱苦的階段中來從事於最壯烈最光榮的空中搏殺敵人志敵的。他們是響應知識青年從軍的號召，他們在民國三十三年十二月陸續在昆明入伍，考試是特別嚴格的，到三十四年一月方始完成了入伍生應負的工作後，而進入了學校受着嚴格的訓練。其中，曾又舉行過赴印考試，那時參加考試的總歟將近四百人，內有成都華西　華西大學等和望江樓四川大學等校來的，他們的數額將超過二分之一。在四月十四日那一天，他們做過了每個空軍官生必須實行的預立遺囑、五月間就飛越駝峯，到印度孟加拉省之汀江，改乘火車西行，到達了全印文化中心旁遮普省的臘河城。就在是月下句開始飛行和地面的敎育，經過了整整兩個月的初級第一階段敎練之後，除了一部份因爲體格變化或飛行進度落後而淘汰外，每個廿四期的學生，都能獨自駕駛着「史提曼」練習機機，翱翔在異國的天空，自由自在的廻旋升降了。</p>
<p>學成返國</p>
<p>第一階段修畢後，就開始分批送往美國，去受同盟國空軍兵源補充的聯合訓練，到美國的將近三百人，這時因爲日本正當八月以後無條件投降，所以中止去美的二四期生有二十五人。</p>
<p>到美國去的二四期生，由臘河到加爾各答乘船，經蘇伊士運河，出直布羅陀海峽，在美國的最繁華的都會紐約登陸。首先在京特機塲（Genter　Field）入伍，繼在古特費諾機塲（Good　Fellow　Field）學習初級飛行，蘭道夫機塲（Landorlff　Field學中級威廠姆機塲（William　Field）學高級。本年六月已經學成，開始陸續返國了，計總數在二百位以上。</p>
<p>首批自訓</p>
<p>留在　河的二十五位二十四期生，跟着校部復員到杭州，在復校的一年中，經過了中高級的訓練，完成了他們的學業，這是在中國勝利後恢復自訓中的第一批畢業生，他們二十五人之中，學成的二十一人，證實了中國有能力可以自己建立國防的幹部的。在美負責督辦赴美受訓員生敎育事宜的中國空軍副司令毛邦初將軍說：「這次在校的第二四期生與赴美的第二四期生，同時完成學業，在地區上雖有國內國外之分，但在本校任初高級飛行敎育的各級主管和敎官，大都是留美考察或受訓回國的，所以敎育方法技術等各方面的造詣完全相同的，並無軒輊。」</p>
<p>淘汰比率</p>
<p>在他們入學時將近四百餘人中，現在在團內外畢業的學生合計是二百多人，淘汰率佔百分之三十五强。</p>
<p>在國內二十一名的畢業生中，第一名爲梁燕生，總分是八七分，並得飛行第一。他們其中被淘汰的將近百人，而這百人大半因爲體格和飛行能量的遞减，然而在二十四期這樣淘汰的比率，已經是很少的了。現在，留在校內受訓的，還有二十五期和二十六期，廿七期也已經開始入學了。</p>
<p>二四期的畢業生，要分發到部隊中去見習，目前空中運輸工作也需要的異常迫切，將挑選一部份送往空軍運輸部隊去服務。他們經過一個短時間的見習以後，就將在祖國的長空中担任空中運輸的任務。至於在學校担任敎官這一層，那將是爲數甚少，並且還需要接受一種敎官的專門訓練</p>
<p>生力部隊</p>
<p>空軍官校敎育長胡偉克，他見到了在目前的空軍中又增加了如許生力部隊，興奮極了，於是在盛大的畢業典禮後，親駕一機作驚險的特技表演，以說明他心中的愉快。空軍訓練司令劉牧羣將軍，他也欣喜的爲記者說：「二十四期的學生底素質是優越的，這許多生力軍參加在中國的空軍裏面，將是一股宏大的力量。」</p>
<p>在這復校一週年紀念與廿四期畢業典禮的一日中，全校官生與來賓參加了隆車壯嚴的典禮，繼着又看了滬杭兩地空軍的籃球友誼賽，緊接着廿四期畢業學生作着空中分列式的受檢閱式，那是龐大的機羣，一隊隊的組成了矯健的空中長城，傲　在度闊的太空，他們是能自衛的巨鷹，展開他們的鐵翼，對他猖獗的狐兎子以無情的監視。在地面的人，爲了這翱翔英勇的空中行列所神馳着了，大家仰着頭，作着欣善的注視。</p>
<p>當天，空校有着三個宴會：中飯是聚餐，下午是雞尾酒會，晚上又是聚餐。下午八時又舉行了蔣英小姐的獨唱會。她婉轉珠喉的展開，正說明着爲了祖國空軍增加了生力軍而歌頌。</p>

<p>小學生們關心建設</p>
<p>武進圩塘鎭僻處長江南岸，歷來政府推動政令及一切建設，均爲落後，而我所要披露的意見如下，本鎮因水陸交通不便，所以商業方面並不發達。水道（澡港河）因年久失疏，泥土淤塞，不適宜於航輪，據本鎭年長者云，在民國十九年開疏一次，迄未開過。去年八月中建設廳派員測勘該河通，本鎭公所即函請救濟總署協助疏濬，未現事實。陸路（龍圩）公路，在敵僞時强迫民衆闢造，草草完成，在去年曾行公共汽車，因路面橋樑時常發生危險，旋吿停駛。因此本鎭遇有要公向縣政府或區公所聯絡，只好專人步行。我希望政府爲改善本鎭的永利交通，迅將河道疏濬，恢復公路行車，同時架設鄉區電話。（圩塘小學生盛行）</p>
<p>新疆事件燃起怒火</p>
<p>此次外蒙軍非法侵我新疆白塔山，除政府當局已發表嚴正聲明外，舉國人民，同聲憤慨，本欄據讀者孫德亮李熙陽等諸君投函數起，限於篇輻，摘錄其要旨如次：</p>
<p>外蒙本屬我國版圖，勝利以後，政府爲遵從總理遺訓扶植民族自治，許其獨立，乃反恩爲仇，寇我疆土，是可忍也孰不可忍，凡我國民，應督促政府一本領土完整之立塲，採取有效措施，決不稍有讓步，一面籲請武裝的共黨，放棄黨派之爭，精誠團結，一如抗日時期，集中力量，抵禦外侮，一面各守本位，埋頭建設，鞏固國防，時至民族存亡關頭，大家應提高警覺云。</p>
<h3>三十年來空前未有的浩刧　粵四江洪水泛濫</h3>
<p>— 廣州廿日航訊　本報特派員梁風</p>
<p>自入夏以來，粤省各地，終日大雨傾盆，盡夜不息；從五月下旬開始，直到六月下旬止，竟沒有過一個晴天；這樣　雨纏綿一個多月的結果，便使省內的東，西，北，韓四江，山洪暴發，有如萬馬奔騰，傾瀉而出，因而泛濫成災，哀鴻遍野；受害的地區，除了四江流域的三十個縣份以外，最近連粤南以及瓊崖各縣，亦遭嚴重的水患，所以目前水災的範圍，實在已遍及了廣東全省；這是自民國四年所謂「乙卯水災」以後所僅見的情形，也可說是廣東三十年來空前未有的浩刧！</p>
<p>無可抵禦的天災</p>
<p>廣東是瀕海的省份，地勢低陷，東西北韓四江，均經省境而出海；每年夏季因雨量較多，各江江水必漲，所以沿江的居民，均築堤圍以防洪潦侵襲，這有如建築防禦工事一樣，從江的上游　次建築一道道的基圍，作爲抵禦洪水敵人的防綫；但有時雨最過多。洪水不及宣洩，水位便高，水流也就愈速，兩岸的防綫於是不難被洪水攻破，泛濫成災。民國四年廣東的「乙卯水災」，就是因爲當時西北江沿江的基圍，全被冲毁，連拱衛廣州最鞏固的防綫——淸遠三水間的石角園，亦吿崩缺，致使廣州城內三分之二的地區，盡成澤國，水及門楣；而全省流離失所的災民，達數百萬，其災情慘重，可想而知，一記者雖未嘗日覩當時情形，但兒一時曾聽過家人說及，恐怖印象，至今仍甚深刻；誰想到三十年後的今天，正當復員不久，重建伊始，民困未蘇之際，竟降臨了這一塲無可抵擋的天災，造成了三十年來未有的慘劇，怎能不使人仰天浩嘆啊！</p>
<p>東江水災區最廣</p>
<p>現在省內各江的災區，是以東江水淹的區域爲最廣闊，而水勢之洶湧及被淹的深度，則以西北江爲甚。先說東江吧：被淹的區域，包括有籠川，河源，紫金，惠陽，博羅，增城，東莞，花縣等縣；因沿江著名的基　如燕窩，福隆，西湖，太平，韓溪水閘，廣和，　舟，浦尾，五鄉，鯉魚洲以及新築的馬鞍圍，無一不被先後冲毁；致河源，紫金，惠陽等，均已全縣普遍被淹；其中惠陽災情尤重，水位已高出馬鞍圍三尺，所以田園房屋，悉爲水淹蓋，家物牲畜，　然無存；結集山頭趨避的災民，達二十萬人以上。河源縣城，房屋亦全遭沒頂，被冲塌者三四百間，民衆淹斃白餘人。東莞石龍一帶，縱横百里，一片汪洋；博羅全城均在水中，增城近廣九路一帶鄉村，悉遭淹沒，塌屋達千餘所，溺斃鄉民數目，更屬無法調査。同在粤東的韓江流域，受災的有澄海，潮安，潮陽，饒平，以至五華，梅縣，興寗等縣份，其中以漸安及澄海災情，較爲嚴重。</p>
<p>西江北江的慘情</p>
<p>至於西江與北江方面，其災情或無東江之慘，但損失與嚴重情形，則恐有過之而無不及；因爲廣東歷年水漲，均已西潦爲最兇猛；西江是自桂境梧州入境，自高而下，水流至速，而且在三水的西南鎭與北江匯流，經珠江三角洲南海新會等縣而出海；所以三水以下俗稱爲西北江，那裏因兩水爭流，水勢於是更猛烈。而珠江三角洲一帶，盡屬富庶之區，地土肥美，農作物至爲豐富，因此所受水災的損失，也至重大。現在北江流域的淸遠縣城，已全被永淹，較低陷處更水深丈餘；四會從化等縣，亦有多處水災，而西江情形，更爲嚴重；鬱南，德慶，都城，悅城等地，因當西江入境之衝，沿岸基圍，均已崩缺；各縣城內，被淹兼旬，數千房屋，均遭沒頂，災民流離失所，居食無依，爲狀慘不忍睹。再沿西江而下，高要的　步大園及蓮塘，公信，永安，會龍，豐樂等園，亦告先後崩潰；工程尙未完成的新江大園又已冲破，附近三十餘鄉以及良田萬頃，全　淹沒。號機廣東示範國的要明十三圍，現也險象業生，其中大沙圍已缺，有二萬畝農田被淹，如缺口再崩，則高要高明兩縣，可能完全淹沒。西江上游重鎮的肇慶，則早已在馬路上行舟，城內最高的地區，也水深過膝；商業幾至全部停頓，電廠亦因被淹不能開機，全城變成黑暗世界了！</p>
<p>廣州幸未釀巨災</p>
<p>至於廣州的情狀，因水位畢竟未至「乙卯」紀錄，故尙未釀成巨災；不過市區低陷地方，亦早已被潦水侵入；現在西關東堤河南一帮街道，均已盡　，水深自一尺至五尺；而注塘，南岸，芳村，黄沙等地，更已一片汪洋，盡成澤國，，居民紛乘小艇趨較高地方暫避，更有不少因房屋被淹，　男帶女，露宿街頭，情形至爲狼狽。尤以十八十九兩天，因盛傳石角　已崩缺，大家憧憬到「乙卯」水災的慘狀，便更倉皇失措，以爲大難馬上降臨，眞是食不甘味，睡不安枕；治安當局也經常派出員警漏夜巡邏，隨時報吿水勢的演變，使市民準備逃生。至二十日雖證實石角圍並無崩缺，但城內水位仍有漲無退，市民不安情緒，迄未少减。而且由於各地水災關係，市外交通幾乎完全斷絕，粤漢路廣武，廣三等綫因浸過路面，不能通車；廣九綫亦曾一　停開，現已恢復，而公路因橋樑涵洞多被水冲毁，損失在三十億元以上，因而省內的公路車輛，幾乎完全停頓；至各江輪渡，亦因水流過緊，也不敢航行；致使各行商業，均大受影響；而各項民生日用品因來源斷絕關係，更激起惡性上漲；米價在一日之間，竟上漲十餘萬元，最高每担曾至三十三萬元的紀錄，其他物價亦在數天內上漲達一倍；所以市民雖未直接受到水災的禍害，但物價上漲的威脅，也足使市民呌苦連天的了！</p>
<p>十萬火急的賑務</p>
<p>在邊地哀鴻聲中，救濟當然是目前十萬火急的要務：所以黨政軍當局以及各界社會人士，對救濟水災的策劃與奔走。有日以來，備極忙碌；而各機關撥出救濟的米糧與款項，也有了相當的數字：計善救分署已撥米一千二百噸，暹僑捐米委會撥出三百五十噸；省府也將五月份撥發各縣的賑款一億元，全數撥作救濟水災之用，另外並撥出惠濟義倉租穀二千市担，紐約華僑捐款托購暹米二百五十四包，並發動全雀省市級公務員捐出薪津一日。同時行轅，省市府，省市參議會，糧救協會，記者公會等機關社團所組織的「展東全省水災緊急救濟委員會」，已於十六日正式成立、該會已電請行政院撥急賑款一百億元，及商請四聯分處墊借五十億元以濟急，並發動各界義捐救濟。這個救災的運動誠然是如火如荼地開展着，但到記者發稿時止，水勢還是有漲無退，證明這災情實在不知伊於胡底，而目前本省的力量，恐已盡獻，就善救分署據說已粒米無存，所以我們還須向省外各地作緊急的呼籲帮助救濟哩！</p>

<h3>「盧梭」迷　（相聲劇）</h3>
<p>— 江松</p>
<p>為盧梭誕辰紀念而作</p>
<p>〔B君端坐椅上正翻着一部盧梭的傳記，若有所思；A手持甜蘆粟一根，上〕</p>
<p>A：你瞧，我今天天買了一根蘆粟。</p>
<p>B：是的！今天是盧梭的生日，Jean　Jacques　Rousseau。　　　A：什麽「幾　　票」？</p>
<p>B：盧梭是一個偉人，是十八世紀法國大敎育家，今天是他的生日。</p>
<p>A：我當是甚麼大亨的生日，一個敎育家何必大驚小怪，他値得了幾個錢一斤，我這根蘆粟化了兩千塊才買的。</p>
<p>B：我不准你這麼說，他是我最崇拜的世界上最偉大的人，你不能侮辱他！</p>
<p>A：瞧你這股認眞的勁，我可不跟你嚕　，我還要去打電話給老王……一七一二〇。</p>
<p>B：一七一二年就是盧梭誕生的那一年，他生在瑞士的日內瓦。　A：哦，不，我記錯了，是一七六二〇。</p>
<p>B：一七六二年是盧梭發表「愛彌兒」的那一年。</p>
<p>A：我要請他來看電影。</p>
<p>B：那時候還沒有電影，電影是一八九三年才發明的。</p>
<p>A：你說什麼呀？我說的是請老王看電影，老王是我的好朋友。</p>
<p>B：盧梭有一個好朋友——Mrs'Warens，這個人在他潦倒的時候給他很大的幫協。　　A:你瘋了，你怎麼把隨便什麼事都扯上盧梭，我說的是請我的朋友老王去看電影，隨後還到爵士裏喝杯咖啡，那兒有女招待，嘿：女招待！</p>
<p>B：不錯，盧梭有一個情人，是女招待，名呌Tcersele。</p>
<p>A：是眞的嗎？這傢伙倒是豔福不淺，法國的女招待一定是很風騷的。</p>
<p>B：有人把盧梭的名字翻成盧騷，可眞不大雅觀。</p>
<p>A：我的天！你永遠蘆粟長，蘆粟短的，我都給你膩死了。</p>
<p>B：盧梭不長不短身高五尺七吋半，體重一百三十八磅，棕色頭髮，白哲面孔，鼻子稍爲有點灣曲。</p>
<p>A：眞沒辦法，好好，算你狠，我們談談別的正經好不好？</p>
<p>B：好！我來問你，科學和藝術進步以後，對於人類道德有益，還是有害？」</p>
<p>A：我不知道，大槪，大概是有害的吧？</p>
<p>B：對！你跟盧梭的意見一致。</p>
<p>A：怎麽呢？</p>
<p>B：這是一七四九年法國茅戎學會的徵文題目，盧梭的文章當選第一，他因此轟動巴黎，一舉成名哪！</p>
<p>A：那我怎麽沒有一舉成名呢？唉。人類眞是他媽的不平等</p>
<p>B：那你硏究過「人類不平等的原因」嗎？</p>
<p>A：算了吧！我都給你攪昏了，你還問它幹嗎？</p>
<p>B：這是茅我學會第二次徵文題目，可情這次盧梭落選了。</p>
<p>A：當選也罷，落選也罷，我給你攪得都忘了吃蘆粟了。</p>
<p>B：什麽，你要吃盧梭？</p>
<p>A：胡說！我指的是蘆粟，不是你那個盧梭。……唉，說眞的，像我這樣沒學問的人將來畢業了怎麼辦？我有時想想眞怕。</p>
<p>B：誰呌你平日不用功，盡是看戲，跳舞，胡調，我勸你快懺悔吧，將來著一本『懺悔錄』像盧梭那樣。</p>
<p>A：有人介紹我做家庭敎師，你看能不能做？</p>
<p>B：很好，盧梭也做過一年的家庭敎師。</p>
<p>A：我可不大願意幹，像老王從前唸政治，將來畢業時弄個官兒做做倒不壞。</p>
<p>B：他旣然唸政治，那他一定讀過盧梭的『民約論」，你問問他這本書怎麼樣。</p>
<p>A：可是他現在已經轉入音專，畢業以後還不是失業。</p>
<p>B：那他可以做音樂師啊，這是極光榮的，臘梭做過的職業</p>
<p>A：你以爲什麽職業最合你的理　想？</p>
<p>B：雕刻師，書記，辯護士，測量家。……</p>
<p>A：這都是盧梭做過的職業？</p>
<p>B：嗯！</p>
<p>A：滾你的吧！盧梭迷，時間已經不早，五點半的電影不知來不來的及，喲！我的鐵怎麽壞了。</p>
<p>B：正好，我還要吿訴你，盧梭的父親是個　匠。</p>
<p>A：你饒了我吧！好人，我要走哪！</p>
<p>B：哦！今天這樣好的天氣，這一個美麗的盧梭　辰紀念。走吧！我請你吃碗籌麪。</p>
<p>A：書癡子！傻瓜！他是你的什麽人，你老是記着他的生日？——你太太是幾時生日？</p>
<p>B：我不知道，我却知道盧梭太太的生日是六月廿三。</p>
<p>A：今天算我吃　，再會吧！盧梭迷。</p>
<p>B：朋友，假如你懂得盧梭，你就知道盧梭是値得我們迷戀的了！</p>
<p>本日爲法國大思想家兼著作家盧梭（A1712-1778）誕辰紀念，本刋特刊此稿，藉以約略介紹此一代宗師之生平。（編者）</p>
<h3>箭</h3>
<p>— 中直</p>
<p>「嘶」的一聲，迎面飛來一支金箭，無計迴避，給牠射中心田。</p>
<p>帶着受傷的心，去找人醫治。找遍了方士，尋遍了醫師，沒有人能够醫治我受傷的心。</p>
<p>帶着受傷的心，去翻遍古籍，尋遍文獻，找不到一個方案，可以醫治我受傷的心。</p>
<p>於是，去找射箭的人，她說：「晚了。」</p>
<p>「晚了」？竟是如此輕描淡寫？</p>
<p>忍着無限的痛和苦，毅然拔去金箭，索性拖在一邊。</p>
<p>眞的晚了！</p>
<p>只能一卷卷的經典，來修補這被箭射傷的心田。</p>
<p>時光之箭前帶走了愛情之箭的發射能力！</p>
<p>現在是眞的晚了。</p>
<h3>花街三章</h3>
<p>— 李白鳳</p>
<p>花街</p>
<p>走過擺滿盆花的小街，每次，我總不禁停下車來，在攤前逐　一審視。</p>
<p>是這末多的凡花俗柳啊！它們故意做出亭亭玉立的樣子，有時還開出醜惡的顏色的花朶；還自命孤芳地在朋儕中誇耀俗惡的顏色。</p>
<p>蘭花早已凋零盡了，梅花也老盡冬心，而松樹呢？它也被放置在雜草之間，勁直的身軀也因人世推移變得「鞠躬如也」的灣曲了——我知道，花草雖屬小道，也必須要力求媚俗阿世才能生存。</p>
<p>最使人厭惡的就是牡丹，它嚴然以『廟堂宰』的姿態，傲然自處於羣花之間；其實，牡丹並不以顏色，不以香氣，不以風度見勝；它之所以被人重視，只因着花大葉肥，——看見它，我不禁想到相書上說的：肥頭大耳的富貴相。</p>
<p>菊花和桂枝的節令還遠得很，出汚泥而不染的荷花呢？想必在這『舉世混濁』的時候，獨以察察之身自居淸野的罷？不然，在這條花街上，怎麼連一盆荷花也看不見呢？——是『有伯樂而後有千里馬』麽？那末，在這沒有周茂叔的世界上，沒有荷花也正相宜的。</p>
<p>就算是『玩物喪志』罷？現在，連想喪志的機會也沒有了；這充滿凡花俗柳的街，徒然擺得够多的花花草草，反而覺得山崖水際的一棵孤松，破竹籬邊的一畦叢菊來得可貴了。</p>
<p>好花不是沒有的，然而並不在道喧囂的市區，我想到庾子山小園賦裏的：「爰居避風，本無情於　較。』世界上也許還有太多的展禽，正想着用軒車以數鶴呢！</p>
<p>放鶴的人是百世而不一賭的，煮鶴焚　的也許變成紛紛的屠狗客。這世界是不會有好花好草容身之地的，如果有，也會是臭白菜爛豆芽的野草閑花，在以淸流自居，自欺欺人地以高標自許罷？</p>
<p>星羣</p>
<p>夜空中熌爍着星羣，它以難得的智慧向大地誇耀。</p>
<p>星羣注視着大地，它看見高山，看見大海，然而却看不見人羣——</p>
<p>不是看不見，而是不屑於去者這卑汚的人類，雖然人類寄居於地球，一如星羣的寄居於天空，可是，星乃和平的使者，它們相處得安然，而人類的相處，就發生了戰爭與廳擦。</p>
<p>天空雖然也有不測的風雲，那是無關於愛好和平的星羣的，而且風雲不論多末險惡，總會風流雲散地再現着天，最後，和平的夜空，仍然會屬於安謐的星羣</p>
<p>星羣是天空智慧的表徵，在白畫，炎炎的赤日以它底威熖障蔽了天空，而夜呢？却用星羣顯示自己智慧的存在……</p>
<p>人類與其志在高山流水，不若志存於夜空的星羣；因爲，星是愛好和平的，它敎人類深思和暇想——</p>
<h3>英·拜倫作　為了配上樂譜而作的詩節</h3>
<p>— 真勤試譯</p>
<p>『美麗』底女兒們中沒有一個能富有魔術，像你一樣；</p>
<p>而你底甜蜜的嗓子對我有如音樂飄在水上；</p>
<p>這時，那聲音似乎能使受了迷惑的海洋靜止，所以海水耀眼地躺着不動，被催眠了的風兒也像在做夢。而午夜的月亮正在織出</p>
<p>她晶榮的紗網眾住大海，大海底胸脯在微微起伏，</p>
<p>像一個睡着了的嬰孩：於是靈魂向你行禮，來聽你，來崇拜你；帶着一種充沛而溫柔的情感，像夏天底海洋底泛濫。</p>
<p>〔這首詩是拜命底抒情傑作，作於一八一五年，發表於一八一六年拜侖之「詩集」中。後人所編各稱詩選中，此詩常常入選，但多無題，譯者特從全集査出其題目，照譯如上。——譯者〕</p>
<h3>愛底哲學</h3>
<p>— 雪萊作　灃莉譯</p>
<p>源源泉注於江河</p>
<p>江河流入海洋，</p>
<p>天風恬靜而諧和</p>
<p>綺妮的情感蕩漾，</p>
<p>世界上無物不成對，</p>
<p>萬裏只一條神聖的定理？</p>
<p>生命是互相融匯——</p>
<p>爲何妳不和我在一起？</p>
<p>看羣峯吻着雲天，</p>
<p>彼浪也互相縮綣；</p>
<p>花兒似的姊妹也不免罪譴</p>
<p>倘不把她底弟兄當作愛伴；</p>
<p>陽光懷抱着大地，</p>
<p>月華密吻着海波——</p>
<p>這些吻有什麽意思，</p>
<p>如果妳不吻我？</p>
<h3>歌</h3>
<p>— E·愛倫坡作　培茵譯</p>
<p>我見到妳在妳底新婚之夕——</p>
<p>嘗灼熱的酡顏浮上妳底雙頰，</p>
<p>雖然歡樂躺在妳底四周，</p>
<p>妳滿意於世上的一切。</p>
<p>在妳眼中的</p>
<p>閃炯的光芒</p>
<p>（這將是什麼）</p>
<p>是我在世上所見到的一切中</p>
<p>最可愛的，也是最可疼的。</p>
<p>這酡顏，也許是處女底害羞——</p>
<p>像這些是最易消逝的——</p>
<p>雖然它底熱情已燃起了强勁的火熖</p>
<p>在他底懷中，噫！</p>
<p>那人見到妳，在妳底新婚之夕，</p>
<p>當灼熟的酡紅浮上妳底　頰，</p>
<p>雖然歡樂躺在妳底四周，</p>
<p>妳滿意於世上的一切。</p>
<p>附記：愛伽·愛倫坡（Edgar）Altan　Poe，美國十九世紀大詩人，亦爲近世短篇小說之領袖。所作詩富於神秘色彩，實爲象徵主義之前驅，法國詩人波萊特爾即深受其影響。愛氏全集共十册，本簾載全集第十册。愛氏生於一八〇九年一月十九日，死於一八四九年十月七日。</p>

<h3>夢外樓詩</h3>
<p>— 徐澄宇</p>
<p>聽琴歌</p>
<p>丈夫意氣雄四海，却斂四海歸一心。焚香掃地坐瞑目。忽聽蕭蕭松樹林，寫我胸中意，因君指上琴。指上一弦一回轉，巫峽清秋白日晚；玄猿嶺上嘛初低，孤　雲中聲漸遠；飛繫流泉患無窮，淥水淸商宛轉通；春萬秋葉心魂外，餘響　　夢寐中；海上移情三萬里，棧邊窺月十二重；此時江月與江水，空明無際淸無比；水月湛湛蕩幽襟，丘壑一一生弦指。哀音變調忽悽切，腸斷關山雨風雪；易水荆卿宋意歌，河橋蘇武李陵別；仰視浮雲太始初，乾坤萬占烏過虛。世上功名何足貴，且莫寥落琴尊味。</p>
<p>狗的狼性</p>
<p>「野性的呼聲」的確是一部偉大的書籍，它不單顯示出狗的狼性存在，甚而暗示着人的蠻性遺留的根源……與此書異調同工的，該是英國詩人的『美人狐』罷？它表面上荒唐而且無稽地寫出人變狐的蠻性，而實際上，心性的狐變，並不限於女人。</p>
<p>『搖尾乞憐』是狗被　善後的後天奴性的成長，『狗急跳牆』却是它天性中一點尙未全熄的星火；不是麼？狗雖忠於主子，仍有它的狼性存在的。</p>
<p>不過，爲着適合於生存的條件，狗是弱者，它想生存，就不能不考慮生存的條件，它深知人類的險惡和統治慾的高漲，於是便俯首貼耳地馴伏在人類的脚前，以求蔭庇在「打狗看主人」大題之下。</p>
<p>然而，狗仍然有它那奴性的悲哀的，因爲忘恩負義的人類，時常會在狡兎死後而烹却走狗的。狗之可鄙不在它的仗人勢而吠聲吠影，却在於它不知道末路將臨。</p>
<p>狼是消滅不了的，而狗呢？有狡兎在，它可以苟延殘喘的活下去，到狡兎死盡的時候，世間上也許只有狼和有狼性的狗存在了。</p>
<h3>冬日的陽光（油畫）</h3>
<p>— 英·邱吉爾</p>
<h3>摘毛針</h3>
<p>— 蘇旦</p>
<p>城外的綠草叢中，長着一種名呌毛筋的小草，它底葉捲內，裏着的一條軟綿綿的白蕊子，沒有味道，也沒有濃香，那是一切的人都不會注意的一種野生植物，然而它却是一羣孩子底口糧。</p>
<p>孩子們，瘦癟蹩的，只要是晴天，他們便從破敗的茅屋中出來，三三兩兩，邀合在一塊，來往奔竄於荒塚野墳之間。</p>
<p>他們蹲在草地上，低垂着頭，轉動着一對不靈活也沒有光彩的眼睛，用兩隻細腿夾着身子移動，像瘦螃蟹，擺過去擺過來。他們一邊摘，一邊剝出那軟綿綿的白蕊子塞到嘴裏咀嚼，在他們嚥下去之前，總要反復咀嚼好一會，好似城裏兒童嚼着口香糖。但是，有訛知道這是他們感覺有滋味還是難於嚥下。從這個墳頭竄到那個墳頭，——阿妹，快到這邊來摘——這裏好多喲，阿弟！</p>
<p>寂靜的氛圍，不時揚起這召喚的聲音。一撮叢密的毛針，一條肥大的白蕊子，要在蒼白的小臉上漾起無比欣喜的笑容。</p>
<p>漸漸，他們手中的毛針積了一大把，積到他們底手掌握不住時，他們就用根長籐草束成一綑擱在旁邊。他們要積得更多，爲了帶回家去分給他們更小的弟妹吃。</p>
<p>腐朽的棺木，殘破的骷髏，顯露在他們面前，而沒有惹他們發出一聲驚呌。他們蹲在它旁邊摘着吃着，臉上沒有一絲表情。一具骷髏，一片棺木，是已裝點他們一日的生活了。</p>
<p>他們背着好看的藍天，籃天中飄浮着如絹如帶的白雲，幾隻翱翔的玲瓏鴿子，投下一陣悠揚淸越的鈴聲；有時飛過那發出震撼四野的馬達聲的銀色飛機，都難得引他們抬起頭來瞧瞧。一切，一切都彷彿離得他們很遠的，除了他們面前的毛針。</p>
<p>常有自城內開汽車到郊外來遊春的男女們，濃艷雅潔的服裝，要引起他們頻頻顧盼；他們竚立墳頭，向着那些縱情談笑的男女投出奇異的眼光。待那些男女坐下來野餐，他們一窩錄似的團攏去瞧着。野餐完了，溫和而安靜的他們就爲那扔棄在草地上的一片殘餘的麪包屑，那菓醬罐，那白蘭地酒瓶……發生搶奪，在一陣推擠打罵之後，他們有的舐着菓醬罐或麪包層，有的吹着酒瓶裏的餘　，有的在旁瞪眼哭着，而意興闌珊的遊客們在臨歸時發出一陣有趣的鬨笑了。</p>
<p>但是，當汽車帶走一陣笑聲後，溫和而安靜的孩子們，他們又合了攏來，又回到墳頭去蹲着摘毛針，去搜尋他們春天的口糧了。</p>
<h3>烏托邦的憧憬</h3>
<p>— 報童</p>
<p>讀過柏拉圖的「理想國」與摩爾的「烏托邦」後，看看這大千世界，總感到有點兒失望，即使拜讀一下康有爲的「大尙書」，我們也不能不感佩這位今文學家在思想上的闊步。自然旣名之爲「理想國」，書之爲「烏托邦」，稱之爲「大圖書」，都祗是烏有之鄉，沒有一點兒現實感的。但是却也未必，這世界倒也無須歐文先生來人工的輕營新大陸的天國，世外尙確有桃源在，下面就是十四日的本報電：</p>
<p>「蘭嶼位於台東，居民俱爲土著，屬高山族之耶莫屬。蘭嶼島上，丘陵綿亘，氣溫甚高，爲原始性社會，全嶼共有六個部落，家庭機構或有或無，並無酋長，居民極爲純樸，而無階級貧富尊卑之分，愛好和平，不嗜爭鬥，彼輩共同生活，日出而作，日入而息，工作之餘，則鼓腹而遊，月明　歌，無飢饉，無盜賊，無欺詐，無戰爭，不知文明賜予人類之幸福，亦不知文明帶給人類之痛苦，誠東方之世外桃源，西方之烏托邦也。」</p>
<p>讀着這個電文，我們像在溫習一個希望，或是朗誦一首詩，記者在下筆之際，似乎是充分感動與憧憬的。自然，作爲一個讀者，其情亦是一樣。我們今天所理想的即是無飢饉，無盜賊，無欺詐，和無戰爭的世界，我們今天所追求的原來是無階級貧富與尊卑的社會。你想，日出而作，日入而息，鼓腹而遊，月明謳歌，這本米是人生的最高境界，在社會發展史言，這些原皆原始社會的情形，可是歷史讓人類走遠路，文明改造了世界，却帶來痛苦與幸福，人類又要懷戀與追求起他們祖先的生活來了。</p>
<p>這使我想起一位科學家的話：</p>
<p>「我們的錯誤就在於科學越過了道德，對原子我們知道得太多，對自己知道得太少。我們應該呼喚科學暫停，給一人類一個再學習金箴玉言的機會。」</p>
<p>這種感嘆不是沒有理由的，當道德尙未建立，人的關係還沒有修正以前，科學與文明常常幣來小部份的幸福和衆多的痛苦。它不但不能使世界進步，反造致社會分化。至於今之諾貝爾之成爲戰爭和侵略的帮兇，如英國之研究電波雲，設計細菌彈，李契敎授之發明新式火箭彈，使我們懷疑科學文明之爲用究在何處了？</p>
<p>自然，文明無罪，科學亦無罪，祗是人類對自己的認識和對人的關係的探求也得俱同　進才好。所以在科學文明中保持我們祖先的合羣精神，那末這個大千世界也就比　嶼更値得追求與憧憬了。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>記譚嗣同　晚清思想界之彗星</h3>
<p>— 閔子</p>
<p>譚嗣同，瀏陽人，幼治算術，造詣頗深。也曾讀過所謂「格致」一類的譯文，把當時所有的科學知識儘量採用，好作駢體文，喜談名理，且又用今文學家的「太平」「大同」之義，作爲「世法」的極軌，而通於佛敎。幼稚龐雜之論固然難免，但是他能躍出舊思想的羈絆而獨創一種風格，則在前淸一代，可以說沒有第二個人。</p>
<p>他的所謂「科學」的著作，僅有仁學一卷。書中假合灣人而抒發憤懣，痛譏淸廷，故又名曰「台灣人所著書」。這本書是將科學，哲學。宗敎三者溶合一爐，在當時，可以說是一種大胆的嚐試。他著作這本仁學，目的在於「衝決網羅」，這在他的自序上很明白說出了。他要衝決利祿之網羅，俗學若考據若詞章之網羅，全球羣學羣敎之網羅，君主之網羅，倫常之網羅，以及天之綱羅等等。</p>
<p>他竭力徘斥尊古的觀念，他說：「古而可好，則何不爲今之人哉！」對於中國的歷史，他又下過這樣的批判：「千多年來之政，秦政也，皆大盜也；二千多年之學、荀學也，皆鄉愿也。惟大盜利用鄉愿，惟鄉愿工媚大盜。」說得很透澈痛快。而於善惡，他也有獨特的見解。他說天地間無所謂善惡，惡僅是個名，非實也。又說普通的讀書人以天理爲善，以人欲爲悲，而却不知道如若沒有人欲，那里來天理。他要證明「惡由名起」說，就有下面的話：</p>
<p>「惡莫大淫殺……男女構精名淫，此淫名也。淫名亦生民以來，沿習旣久，名之不改，習謂爲惡。向使生民之始，即相習以淫爲朝聘宴饗之鉅典。行諸朝廟，行諸都市，諸稠人廣衆，如土中國之跪拜，西國之抱腰接吻，則孰知爲惡者。戕害生命曰殺，此殺名也。然殺爲惡，則凡殺皆當爲惡。人不當殺，則凡虎狼牛馬鷄豚又何當殺者？何以不並惡名也？或曰人與人同類耳，然則虎狼與人不同類也，虎狼殺人，則名虎狼爲惡，人殺虎狼，何以不名人爲惡也？……」</p>
<p>雖然這是近乎詭辯，但他這種懷疑精神與思想解放的勇氣，是値得使人欽佩的。</p>
<p>對於名敎，他是明目張胆地詆毁着的。他說：</p>
<p>「俗學陋行，動言名教……名以為教，則其教已為實之賓，而決非實也。又况名者由人創造，上以制其下，而下不能不奉之，則數千年三綱五常之慘禍酷毒由此矣。……如曰「仁」，則共名也；君父以責臣子，臣子亦可反之君父。於箝制之術不便，故不能不有「忠孝廉節」一切分別等衰之名，……忠孝旣爲臣子之專名，則終不能以此反之。雖或他有所據，意欲詰訴，而終不敵忠孝之名爲名敎之所尙。……名之所在，不惟關其口使不敢昌言，乃並錮其心，使不敢涉想。……」</p>
<p>仁學的下卷，又多政論。從他的思想上，可以看出他是一個世界主義的祟拜者。他說「春秋一統之義，天地間不當有國。」又說「不惟發願救本國，並彼極盛之西國與夫含生之類，一切都度之……不可自言爲某國人，當平視萬國，皆其國皆其民。」至於「發願救本國者」，就是他以殉敎的精神，鼓吹排滿革命，其辭句銳利不可當。他這樣說：</p>
<p>「天下爲君主切產，不始今日……然而有知遼，金，元，淸之罪，浮於前此君主者乎？其土則穢壤也，其人則羶種也，其心則禽心也，其俗則　俗也。逞其凶殘淫殺，攫取中原子女玉帛……猶以爲未饜，錮其耳目，桎其手足，厭其心思，挫其氣節……方命曰此食毛踐土之分然也。夫果誰食誰之毛，誰踐誰之土？」</p>
<p>他時時想伸張民氣，提倡勇敢之風，所以有與黄遵憲，能希齡等設時務學堂於長沙之舉。那時聘梁啓超爲主講，唐才常爲助敎。學生有蔡諤，李炳寰等四十人，所授爲公羊孟子諸書。梁啓超每日在講堂四小時，夜裏批改學生劄記，有時竟徹夜不寐。而所講的，都是當時一派之民權論，又多淸代故實，臚舉失政，盛倡革命。其論學術，則將漢唐宋明淸學者，抨擊得體無完膚。這以後，又設「南學會」聚講，又設湘報（日刋）湘學報（旬刋），所發表的言論，雖然不及學堂中那樣激烈，但實際上是暗相策應的。</p>
<p>這種宣傳革命的方法與努力，曾經引起湖南新舊派的大閧。戊戍政變以前，某御史臚舉劄記批語數十條，有指斥淸室鼓吹民權者，具摺參揭，卒興大獄。結果是學堂解散，唐才常等被逐，梁啓超亡命日本，而譚嗣同却殉難了。死的時候還祗二十三歲。</p>
<p>梁啓超在痛悼之餘，曾這樣說：</p>
<p>「……若天假以年，則其學將不能測其所至。僅留此區區一卷（仁學），叶萬丈光芒，一瞥而逝。而掃蕩廓淸之力，莫與京焉。故吾比諸彗星。」</p>
<h3>騙的故事</h3>
<p>— 阿病</p>
<p>新近在一張兒童時報上看到一隻很幽默，也很平凡的小故事。在此「騙」風横流中，在所謂「君臣，父子，兄弟，夫婦，朋友」中，正不知有多少此類故事在創作中。故事是這樣的：</p>
<p>有一個小孩子，時常流着二管鼻涕，他的祖父對他說：「孩子，你把鼻涕抹了，我給你五百元！」小孩子便將鼻涕吸進鼻管裏，就向他祖父要錢，他的祖父說：「我是騙你的。」小孩子把鼻涕流出來，並且說：「我也是騙你的。」</p>
<h3>獨泊漫談</h3>
<p>— 王聰</p>
<p>莎士比亞說：</p>
<p>「愛情的安慰，有如雨後的太陽光」。　莎翁在另一方面又說：「過遲的安慰，好像是斬決後的赦書」。</p>
<p>有一種女孩子，模梭於自己的愛情，對任何人都未兔有情，純厚的天性是可貴的，然而誤人誤己，結果只有悲劇下塲。因爲，如果你慈悲地將你的臥楊借給乞丐，他必定會將虱子作爲酬謝。</p>
<p>玩弄愛情如玩弄火，偶而不愼，必有自焚之虞。所以我常常愛規勸許多沉溺在愛河中的朋友，不要想一化三千，普濟衆生。</p>
<p>因爲，最執著的愛情是最有價値的愛情。</p>
<p>因爲，愛情不是賞賜，更不是商品。</p>
<p>Geo.Moore謂：「選擇乃是人生最難的事。」（The　difficulty　in　life　is　the　choice）</p>
<p>愛情之產生前，是應該有選擇的，而這種選擇較之選擇工作尤爲困難。我的理由是：兩性間有一種如狂瀾般的「慾潮」蒙蔽了理性。故不能容許作審愼的選。這種「慾潮」常常被人誤認作「愛情」。這幾乎是我們所謂萬物之靈底人類的極普遍的荒謬。</p>
<p>所以，這種荒謬之錯覺下的結合，一如沙上建築的寳塔。不能受時間的考騐。</p>
<p>許多婚姻，在短期內那發生破裂，厥故即在於此。</p>
<p>朋友管君吿我，他與他的妻子當每一次性慾得到滿足後，彼此間即發生一種莫可言宣的厭惡。甚至肌膚的偶一接觸，即刻怒火中燒。然而，在慾問題欲解決前，彼此皆覺頗有厮　的與趣。以此，雙方俱感到矛盾且痛苦。</p>
<p>這眞是一個好例子，我相信有許多人會有同感，不過他們未曾說出罷了。</p>
<p>愛情是什麼？基於以上的看法，我說：「那是慾潮解決後，彼此尙有無限的優美的互戀之情敵。甚至，願犧牲生命，以求對方之一笑者』。</p>
<h3>怪火與自燃</h3>
<p>— 王乾德</p>
<p>隨着勝利的來臨，也就帶來這樣一個新名詞——怪火，尤其是在上海這個名詞差不多每一個人都會知道。</p>
<p>雖然有些「怪火」的確是神秘的，是人不知鬼不測的，搬空了倉庫的物質，儲藏的東西，縱一把火把倉庫，房屋燒得變成灰燼，拿不會說話，不會控訴的「火一來隱瞞了罪孽，做了替死鬼，關於這一類的怪火，我們不必加以詳細的研討。</p>
<p>但是另外一種怪火，礦實是一種化學變化所產生的現象，這種現象在自然科學的書籍上，稱它呌「自燃」（Spontaneous　Combustion。）這種自燃的發生，必須有着下面三個先決條件：體。（一）物質的本身是一種可燃</p>
<p>（二）四週無熱的傳導體。</p>
<p>（三）貯藏的地方空氣不流通。</p>
<p>物質的本身是一種可燃體，就是說這東西它的本性是容易燃燒的，譬如火柴，煤，酒精，磷，硫礦等。</p>
<p>四週無熟的傳導體，就是說倉庫的建築原料都不是熱的良導體，如用木材建築的倉庫，使那些存放的物質，與空氣中的　氣（Oxygen）起了緩和的氧化作用，而所產生的熱，沒有一個傳遞者送出去，至使庫內的溫度漸漸升高，假使溫度一直升高到了這物質的着火點（Kindling　Tem　perturemperture），火災就很容易的產生了。</p>
<p>最後一個原因，就是把倉庫的門窗緊閉，使裏面的熱空氣不能與外面比較溫度低的空氣相互交換，相互流通，而使裏面保持了永久的熱空氣。</p>
<p>現在我們已經很明顯的知道上列三個原因，當然避免也不會困難，只須將倉庫的建築原料改爲熱的傳導體，而不要將物質緊密的堆積，還要將倉庫的門窗常常開啓，使得空氣有交換的機會，如此便可以安全無恙。</p>
<h3>旅美什錦</h3>
<p>— 徐菽圖</p>
<p>汽車階級平民化</p>
<p>物以稀爲貴，美國的蹩脚汽車運到上海也可賣十根八根條子，那種老牛破車，在美國早已當廢銅爛鐵秤噸數賣，我在一九四二年到美國時還看見有四十美元一輛的舊汽車標賣，過了五年，仍見有二三百元的舊汽車。我們同事所買一九四六年新車，每輛至多一千六百元，八九成新的一千二百元儘够了，普通可以用用的大抵在五六百元左右。買汽車毋需一次付淸，先佬貨價百分之二十，以後每月付百分之十，汽車完全成爲你的財產，所以任何美國人或旅居美國人，能够凑足百把塊錢，就可以成爲汽車階級。派報紙的人坐了汽車送報，理髮匠駕了汽車到理髮店工作。</p>
<p>我駐雷鳥飛行學校時，常常搭坐理髮匠的汽車進城。到宿舍裏來掃地及換被單的女傭也坐了自備汽車來上工，在平時每個家庭平均有汽車一兩部。</p>
<p>到了戰時，因爲輪船和汽油受了統制，本來每人坐一部的，改爲四五個人合坐一部，由大家公攤汽油，輪流司機，汽車也是輪流調用，在軍營食堂或俱樂部的公共牌上貼滿了徵求搭客的廣吿Passengers　Wanteo或Share　Carneeded或I　Want　a　ride　to　New　York五光十色，琳瑯滿目，在出入要道，都有斗大吿白，說是請帶士兵進城Please　give　soldiers　a　ride,，凡是穿了軍裝的人，佇候在路邊，自有過路汽車停下來送他到目的地，或送到電車站，不必化一只銅板，美國人認爲汽車多帶幾個人並無損失，在中國的汽車階級看來，給人白坐汽車，非特不上算，而且頗爲失面子。（五）</p>
<h3>路名漫話</h3>
<p>— 神鷹</p>
<p>上海的很多馬路，爲了適合現實，多數重題新名了，在新改路名之際，許多人口襄還是喊着舊名詞，這是說順了口，漸漸的便習熟了。</p>
<p>上海因爲是全國性的都市，新改的路名，往往冠以各地都市的名稱，或名人的名字，前者便於記憶，後者寓意紀念，這是題名之由來，京滬綫的滸　關，「滸」「緊」兩字，比較難識，世傳乾隆循運河下江甫，把「滸』字讀作「許」字，以誤傳誤，到現在很多人嘴裏，還是唸作「許」。所以題地名路名，以通俗容易認識之字爲尙。蘇州里巷名詞，頗多古趣，或地方性歷史掌故。像城西的東米巷，西米巷，倉米巷，宋時爲米市交易之塲。附近一水　廻，直通城河，橋名「殺市橋」，顧名思義，當為糧食集中地，倉米巷則爲一積榖倉。又如花街，柳巷，幽蘭，紫籣，巷名香艷，當時吳宮花草，鷲居其間，迄今思之，猶涉遐思。至若城東之胡相思巷，思婆巷，均有故事影射，志乘記述，不再轉錄。惟胡相思巷，在里巷名稱中，題來促狹，靈心巧思，幽默家林語堂，也要甘拜下風。</p>
<p>護龍街在蘇州城中心爲最長的一條街，南起飲馬橋，北抵北寺塔，在蘇州人口裏，喊作馬視街，最近改名「中正」路。五卅路紀念五卅慘案，與牠並排的一條巷，近來也改名爲「仲仁路」，這是紀念地方耆老張仲仁（一　）先生的。楚傖林則在公園，這些都是紀念地方這人的題名。撫今追昔，一里一巷的名稱，都有牠的來歷可考：至於以人名觀巷，並非仿自外國，蘇州有一條九思巷，這是紀念元末張士誠的，因爲張士誠的小名。呌作九思。</p>

<h3>National Army Advances North of Shuangmiaozipu, Communist Main Force in Siping Flees in All Directions, Southern Advance Troops Capture Gongzhuling Last Night</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Shenyang, Our Newspaper, 27th] The National Army's northern and southern routes between Shenyang and Changchun have made progress. The southern route reached Shuangmiaozipu station on the 27th and is continuing north. The northern route is still on the outskirts of Gongzhuling, with part of it having bypassed to the north bank of the Dongliao River.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Changchun, Our Newspaper, 27th] The communist army in Gongzhuling is putting up fierce resistance. The National Army's Changchun-Nanao advancing troops have secured the areas on both sides of Gongzhuling. As of 4:00 PM on the 27th, they had not yet entered the city.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 27th] The National Army's Changchun-Nanao advancing troops completely recaptured Gongzhuling at 7:00 PM on the 27th and are continuing to advance south.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Changchun, Our Newspaper, 27th] The National Army's Northern advancing troops, under the command of Zheng Dongguo, are making rapid progress. Yesterday afternoon, they eliminated the communist resistance at Shuangmiaozipu. On the 27th at noon, they advanced to a line 15 kilometers from Siping. They can meet with the Siping defenders tonight. The communist front lines are collapsing on both sides of the railway. Siping has been besieged for three weeks, and Daoxi has been reduced to ruins.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 27th] A phone call from Siping at 4:00 PM stated that the National Army's reinforcements advancing north had captured Quantou, 30 kilometers from Siping, at noon on the 27th. They may arrive in the suburbs of Siping tonight or on the 28th. Furthermore, a phone call from Kaiyuan at 1:00 PM stated that Deputy Commander Zheng, along with Army Commander Liao Yaoxiang and Deputy Army Commander Shu Shicun, arrived here on a special military train at noon on the 27th. After a short rest, they went to inspect the forward defense positions. According to Deputy Commander Zheng, Quantou was a communist stronghold, and the National Army's swift capture of it was a major victory. There should be no further resistance between Quantou and Siping. The siege of Siping will not only be lifted easily, but the stubbornly attacking communists will be annihilated on the spot. Kaiyuan has suffered a terrible catastrophe and is extremely desolate.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Changchun, Our Newspaper, 27th] The battle on the outskirts of Siping is fierce. Most of the communist forces are concentrated southeast of Siping.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 27th] The main force of the communist army in Siping retreated in pain to the Bamiancheng area west of Siping on the night of the 26th. Their artillery regiment, Jianbo, had already fled the outskirts of Siping three days prior. The dream of overwhelming the National Army in Siping with numerical superiority has become a bubble after paying the price of tens of thousands of militia lives.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Shenyang, Our Newspaper, 27th] The fierce battle of Siping, the focus of the Northeast war situation, is still continuing. The National Army's Catholic Church stronghold in Tiedong was occupied by the communist army on the night of the 26th, but other locations are safe. Local reports state that the National Army paratrooper unit was airlifted from Nanjing to Shenyang, personally led by Commander Ma Shigong. A batch of them parachuted into the suburbs of Siping on the 26th to help the National Army, which has been defending for a long time. Note: The battle in the Siping urban area has been ongoing for sixteen days and nights.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jilin, 27th] The National Army's various sweeping units on the outskirts of Jilin City are expanding their battlefield gains. Communist forces are fleeing in droves, especially in Jidong. After the National Army in Jinan recovered Shuanghezhen, they continued to attack south. The communist forces at Yantongshan are showing signs of wavering. In the Daxiao Sanjiazi area of Jidong, the National Army surrounded and severely attacked the main force of the communist army's Jixiao Brigade, approximately 1,000 men, yesterday afternoon. The majority were annihilated, except for those captured alive.</p>
<h3>Bishop Yu Bin Discusses the Current Situation, Urges U.S. Economic Aid to China, and Avoids Repeating the Pearl Harbor Incident</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, Our Newspaper, 27th] Bishop Yu Bin called here on the 27th to prevent the outbreak of a third world war in order to avoid another catastrophe for human civilization. The solution is for the United States to provide large-scale aid to China as soon as possible to overcome the current difficulties. In analyzing our country's current so-called "civil war," he pointed out: The prelude to the third world war has already begun within our country. It is still possible to stop it at this moment, otherwise it will be uncontrollable. Bishop Yu made the comments during a luncheon on the 27th, inviting several reporters in Nanjing to comment on the current situation. He stated: People call the Chinese Communist rebellion a "civil strife" and oppose the term "civil war" against the Chinese Communist Party. In reality, there is little difference between a civil war and a civil strife. Due to the facts that the Chinese Communist Party in the Northeast has declared the participation of Korean communists, Japanese prisoners, and Soviet advisors, and that Outer Mongolian troops have invaded Xinjiang, it has been demonstrated that the Chinese Communist rebellion is not a "domestic" strife but an "international war." He advocated "rectifying the name," saying, "If the name is not correct, words will not be proper, and if words are not proper, things will not succeed." Friends of China believe that since it is a "domestic" war, they should wait until the turmoil passes before providing assistance. Therefore, the U.S. loan is slow in coming. Yu believes that the current situation is similar to the September 18th Incident era. He recalled that he had told American friends before the Pearl Harbor incident: The Japanese will attack Pearl Harbor, but the Americans do not realize it. The result happened, and it was too late to prevent it. Currently, it seems that we should no longer make the same mistake. Yu pointed out: U.S. aid to China is not enough to cause a world war, but it can eliminate a world war before it breaks out. Even without material aid, spiritual support is also very necessary. Yu believes that the current material trade assistance is not for military supplies because our country's biggest difficulty at present is the economic problem. Therefore, we urgently hope for U.S. economic assistance. In addition to the $500 million loan, there should be currency system loans or material loans, and the U.S. has the power to provide large-scale aid to China. After supporting Sun Ke's remarks, Yu said: We should clearly tell the United States that we are fighting today not for ourselves but for culture and for the United States. The tragedy of World War II should not be repeated today.</p>
<h3>Fu Sinian Discusses the Current Situation</h3>
<p>Says the Soviet Union has a Strange Temperament</p>
<p>[Local News] Senator (Director of the Institute of History and Philology of the Academia Sinica) Fu Sinian has recently been assigned to go to the United States to investigate the status of Chinese studies in American universities and take the opportunity to seek medical treatment. Fu arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning and is scheduled to take his family on the General Gordon steamer to the United States tomorrow. Yesterday, at the request of reporters, he expressed his views on the current situation. He said: "China and the Soviet Union must cooperate based on geographical and world peace reasons, but cooperation is very difficult due to the Soviet Union's strange character and temperament. It seems that the more polite you are to him, the worse it goes." Regarding Vice President Sun's remarks, he said: "His motive comes from patriotism. Many people feel stifled and need to vent." Fu also believes that "the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is no longer a true civil war due to external forces infiltrating. Although the current situation is serious, the general public is too pessimistic, which is as wrong as being too optimistic in the past." He said: "Financial and economic problems urgently need to be resolved. The government should immediately investigate the deposits of Chinese people in the United States and bring them all back. U.S. dollar bonds can also be assigned to wealthy households. In short, Chinese finance should seek money from the rich, and the government must make a firm determination." It is reported that Fu's stay in the United States will be approximately six months to a year.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Communists, From Top to Bottom, Are All Superstitious About Force</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] When reporters asked Fu Sinian about his views on the current situation, Fu replied: "Regarding internal problems, some people in the government advocate fighting, while the Chinese Communists, from top to bottom, all believe in force. Just listen to the Chinese Communist broadcasts, and you can know the Chinese Communists' views on the current situation. Today, if anyone wants peace, they should ask the Chinese Communists. China's civil war has become internationalized and has become a Spanish-style civil war, but to a slightly lesser extent."</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles in the Northern Section of the Pinghan Railway, Cavalry from Chahar Province Rushes to Support</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Baoding, Our Newspaper, 27th] The defense of Baoding, which is under siege, has begun fiercely. The artillery fire in the four suburbs has not stopped intermittently for ninety-six hours. National strongholds fifteen li outside the city have been abandoned one after another. Refugees are flocking to the city gates. The artillery fire began to gradually diminish by noon. Prices in Baoding have risen. Flour costs 200,000 per bag. Military officers and civilians throughout the city held an emergency meeting yesterday to plan a general mobilization to defend the provincial capital. According to Song Kentang, Deputy Director of the Suiyuan Pacification Headquarters, the Chahar cavalry division is now marching south to provide support.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Beiping, Our Newspaper, 27th] Sun Lianzhong convened a meeting of senior generals from the Baoding Pacification Headquarters in Beiping on the morning of the 27th. Sun went to the Xingyuan in the afternoon to meet with Li Zongren to discuss increasing troops to the northern section of the Pinghan Railway. [Dispatch from Baoding, Our Newspaper, 27th] The mixed battle between the two armies between Xushui and Caohe has not ended. The Caohe defenders withdrew south to Toutai. Shells frequently fell near the Xushui city gate railway station. The defenders fought fiercely. Part of the National Army in Mancheng withdrew east. Reports of fighting also came from the outskirts of Yixian and Laishui yesterday. The railway tracks and bridges between Xushui and Caohe were severely damaged yesterday.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, 27th] Baoding began martial law at 10:00 PM last night.</p>
<h3>Communist Military Transportation is Frequent, a Major Battle is Expected in Central Shandong</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Jinan, Our Newspaper, 27th] Communist military transportation in Shandong is frequent. Night and day, they are transported south from the north bank of the Yellow River, passing through Qingcheng, Huantai, and Zibo, Bo, Yidu, and Yishui. There are more than 500 trucks full of grain and ammunition. It is generally judged that a new major battle in central Shandong is imminent.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Jinan, Our Newspaper, 27th] Lucun, more than 30 kilometers east of Laiwu, is reportedly gathering three communist columns again. The National Army is closely monitoring them. Furthermore, on the 14th and 17th of this month, two transport ships of 2,000 and 3,000 tons each arrived from Zhifu Island in Jiaodong. After unloading the ammunition and weapons they carried, they were reloaded with wheat, peanuts, etc., and sailed towards Dalian and Lushun.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Xuzhou, Our Newspaper, 27th] The National Army in Mengyin, central Shandong, cleared the landmines laid by the communist army along the way on the 27th and is now advancing towards Donglidian (north of Yishui) and Nanma, where the headquarters of the Chinese Communist East China Field Army is located. Furthermore, on the 26th, the National Army annihilated more than 300 communist troops and captured more than 30 in the area north of Dongwangdu and Qingshishan in the northeast of Mengyin.</p>
<h3>The Legislative Yuan Had a Fierce Debate All Day Yesterday and Passed the Law on Punishing Crimes Against Military Service and Other Cases, and the Election Fraud Case Was Sent for Review</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, Our Newspaper, 27th] The Legislative Yuan held its 329th regular meeting all day on the 27th, chaired by Sun Ke. The newly appointed Vice President Wu Tiecheng attended the meeting for the first time. More than 100 legislators attended the meeting, and ministers such as Yu Dawei and Chen Qitian were also present to answer questions related to their respective ministries. The meeting first discussed the postal and telecommunications price increase case, and after passing it, continued to discuss the "Revised Regulations on Eliminating Price Collusion and Setting Price Ceilings," which was explained in detail by Chen Qitian. Later, as the government was discussing a new economic plan, it was resolved to retain the case.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the discussion of the "Revised Lawyers Law" caused an interesting debate, as the case was related to whether legislators could serve as lawyers. When each legislator spoke, they repeatedly stated their reasons in detail. Later, as it was inappropriate for legislators to serve as lawyers, the case was resolved to be sent back for review.</p>
<p>The "Land Administration Department Organization Law" was also one of the important cases at the meeting. The full text of 28 articles was passed smoothly after brief discussion. However, when discussing the "Revised Organization Law of the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission," there were many debatable points regarding the deputy commissioner and the term of office. Although the original case was passed, it caused a small storm. Another fiercely debated case was the "Revised Regulations on the Organization of Provincial Councils." Xia Shengsheng and others strongly argued about the provincial councils' right to review provincial expenditure, and Lu Fu also supported them. Finally, the case was sent back for review. Subsequently, the "Revised Civil Procedure Fee Law" and the "Law on Punishing Crimes Against Military Service" and other cases were discussed and passed smoothly. The highlight of the meeting was the "Draft Law on Punishing Election Fraud." The committee members spoke in a relaxed tone. Wei Tingsheng and others heavily criticized the original draft, and Liu Butong also satirized it in a humorous tone. The most vocal attacker of the case was Wei Tingsheng, who had recently returned from his constituency. Based on his practical experience, he pointed out that under the current circumstances, it is almost impossible to run for election without holding banquets. Even saints born in this world would probably have to use banquets. Wei pointed out the "major fraud" situations in various places. He claimed that most Chinese people could not only not write the names of the candidates they were voting for, but also could not write their own names. Therefore, whoever can control the county magistrate can be elected. It is said that in a certain province recently, there was a case of replacing the county magistrate and commissioner due to bribery. It is better to prevent "major fraud" than to focus on preventing certain amounts of currency leakage.</p>
<p>Liu Butong used a humorous tone to ridicule the military case of the punishment regulations. He claimed that if it is handled according to the draft, one cannot invite guests or provide transportation. The voters would be starving and unable to move. Zhou Yizhi also said that people say that in addition to floods and droughts this year, there is also a so-called "election disaster." The passage of the draft is tantamount to adding "election disaster."</p>
<p>Chen Guyuan disagreed with Liu Butong's statement, explaining that the purpose of the case is to prevent powerful people from manipulating elections. Some people call it a "pauper election law." The main purpose is to give poor people a chance to be elected. The original proposer, Jian Guansan, cited the laws of democratic and advanced countries such as Britain and the United States as examples, explaining that European and American countries have explicit regulations to prevent banquets and other things. The purpose of our proposal is to make the rich aware of the need to be vigilant so that the poor also have a voice in politics. Otherwise, the rich will be happy, and the poor will be in a dark and helpless state. It is necessary for the Legislative Yuan to formulate a separate law. Some people use 500 million yuan as election capital. They have long-term rooms in international hotels. Those who support them are provided with food and drink by the candidates. This kind of thing and the major fraud mentioned by Wei Tingsheng should be prevented by formulating laws. Tan Tiwu, Chen Haicheng, and others also assisted Jian Guansan in speaking, explaining that the purpose of the draft is to protect the politically and economically weak. Chen Guyuan further pointed out that this election is the first step for us to promote constitutional government. We should set a new trend for future generations at the beginning of the event.</p>
<p>The case was discussed for about half an hour. The only thing the two sides argued about was the trivial issues stipulated in the draft. Finally, it was put to a vote, and it was resolved to send it back to the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee for review. The meeting adjourned at about 7:00 PM and was scheduled to hold the 330th regular meeting again on the 28th. Due to the large number of accumulated cases, another meeting will be held on July 3.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] According to a legislator who participated in the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee of the Legislative Yuan, there will be 450 representatives of the National Congress, including 49 people in the liberal professions, of which 12 are journalists (one of whom is female).</p>
<h3>Legislators to Hold a Public Banquet Tonight for the Newly Appointed Vice President Wu Tiecheng</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, Our Newspaper, 27th] The new Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, Wu Tiecheng, attended the regular meeting of the Yuan for the first time on the morning of the 27th. During the meeting, Zhou Yizhi suggested that all legislators hold a public banquet on the evening of the 28th to express their welcome. This suggestion was approved by all with warm applause.</p>
<h3>Postal and Telecommunications Prices to be Increased Fivefold, to be Implemented on July 1, Newspaper Postage Increased Threefold, News Telegraph Increased Twofold</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, Our Newspaper, 27th] The postal and telecommunications price increase case was finally passed after two hours of fierce debate at the Legislative Yuan regular meeting on the 27th and will be implemented on July 1. Postal and telecommunications are generally increased fivefold, while newspaper postage is increased threefold and news telegraph fees are increased twofold. Taking ordinary letters as an example, the price per item will increase from 100 yuan to 500 yuan. Taking ordinary telegrams as an example, the price per word will increase from 200 yuan to 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>After the case was submitted to the Yuan today, Lou Tongsun, the concurrent director of the Economic and Financial Committee, first explained the review process, stating that the case came from the Executive Yuan's "Revised Measures for Subsidizing State-Owned and Public Utilities." The government has previously adopted a subsidy policy for various state-owned enterprises, but due to rising prices, the amount of subsidies has been increasing. Since the promulgation of the Emergency Economic Measures, in order to balance the budget and considering that all expenditures cannot completely rely on issuance, the government considered abolishing subsidies. In the past, the government's subsidies for transportation businesses were over 100 billion. If they were all stopped, the price of ordinary letters would have to rise from 100 yuan to 1,000 yuan to make up for it. The current increase proposed by the Ministry of Communications from 100 yuan to 500 yuan still relies on government subsidies. Otherwise, the adjustment number would not be the case.</p>
<p>Then, Minister of Communications Yu Dawei was invited to explain, accompanied by Tao Fengshan, Director of the Postal and Telecommunications Department, and others. Yu held a table full of numbers, explaining that since the last price adjustment, due to two salary adjustments, the monthly losses were huge. If this is not adjusted, the losses of the postal and telecommunications departments in July will reach 61.4 billion. Therefore, the price will be raised from 100 yuan to 500 yuan, and the remaining amount will still be subsidized by the government. In this way, the losses of postal and telecommunications in July will still reach 20 billion (16.1 billion for postal and 4 billion for telecommunications). On the expenditure side, salaries account for the largest share, accounting for 65%. As a result of layoffs, the telecommunications department laid off 5,000 people, and the postal department laid off 4,000 people, saving a lot of money.</p>
<p>After Yu's report, the legislators raised questions one after another, hoping that the Ministry of Communications would continue to work hard on conservation to save waste. Cheng Yuanzhen cited facts, saying that the Ministry of Communications is too wasteful. Senior officials' residences are paid for by the public, with deposits of tens of millions. There are also various malpractices during the Dragon Boat Festival, which are all unnecessary. Wang Peiren also believes that some measures of the Ministry of Communications are too elaborate and the procedures are too troublesome. They all hope that the entire revenue and expenditure situation can be reported for legislative reference. Chen Guyuan hopes that preferential treatment can be given to soldiers sending letters.</p>
<p>Yu said in his reply that this adjustment is not only to make up for losses, but also to slightly restrict it. If not, the number of letters will be too large to be delivered.</p>
<p>At this point, Dean Sun made a supplementary explanation, clarifying that the price increase of state-owned enterprises will not lead to rising prices. Regarding the abolition of subsidies, the State Council has discussed it twice. If we look at the cost of sending letters, each ordinary letter costs 1,000 yuan. If it is still calculated at 100 yuan in the past, the national treasury will have to pay 900 yuan for each letter. Part of the money paid by the national treasury is obtained from taxation, but most of it relies on inflation. It is the general public who bears the tax burden and suffers from inflation. After the subsidies are cancelled, the national treasury can spend 778.2 billion yuan less (in the past six months), which is an effective measure to stabilize prices. We should not be afraid of the price increase of state-owned enterprises stimulating general prices. We should support this measure, which is sufficient to reduce the issuance, balance the budget, and reduce the burden on the general public.</p>
<p>Yu and others withdrew around 11:00 AM, and the Yuan continued to discuss. Most of the committee members expressed strong dissatisfaction with the various wastes of the Ministry of Communications and even advocated sending people to investigate. Cheng Yuanzhen cited two things to draw attention to. (1) There are many unreasonable places in the expenses of the Ministry of Communications. It seems that the Ministry of Communications should also try to economize on its own expenditures. (2) After the adjustment, the express mail fee is 1,800 yuan per letter, which is not a problem in Nanjing and Shanghai, but in the inland, it is enough to "scare many people to death." Fu Yan also cited an example, saying that many ordinary employees of the Ministry of Communications hire a servant and live in Western-style houses with sofas. The monthly expenses of public funds reach tens of millions. Such enjoyment makes it difficult for people not to be outraged.</p>
<p>Qi Zhihou, Tan Tiwu, and others spoke for the Ministry of Communications, pointing out that Yu has been a good minister since he took charge of the Ministry of Communications and has been working hard to govern. We should encourage him to do good things and not be picky about everything. Chen Guyuan also said that 500 yuan is only enough to eat a steamed bun and is not enough to buy an evening newspaper. It seems inappropriate to be stingy.</p>
<p>Finally, it was put to a vote and passed the case with the largest majority.</p>
<h3>A Large Number of Japanese Spindles are Preserved, China's Textile Industry Can Hardly be Safe, Experts Issue a Warning in Tokyo</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 27th] Several Chinese textile experts issued a warning when they met with Central News Agency reporters this morning, saying that China's domestic textile industry will not be able to obtain temporary security because of the large number of spindles that Japan is allowed to preserve after the war. They solemnly stated that the domestic people have probably neglected a fact, that is, Japanese spindles can rotate 10,000 times per minute, while Chinese spindles can only rotate 6,000 to 7,000 times per minute. Therefore, Japan's output is also higher than China's. The work of the Japanese textile industry is also more intensive. Its textile industry usually works 24 hours a day. Japan's current 2.5 million cotton yarn spindles work 16 hours a day and 300 days a year. Some people think that Japan is allowed to preserve 4 million spindles after the war, which is "completely reasonable." They estimate that each person in Japan consumes about 13 square yards of cotton cloth per year. Therefore, 2 million spindles must be used to produce cloth for domestic consumption, and another 2 million spindles must be used to produce textile export cloth. Japan had 16.5 million spindles before the war, of which 14.5 million were cotton yarn spindles. The country's textile industry progressed rapidly after World War I and replaced Britain in 1933 to become the world's leading textile industry country until the outbreak of the Pacific War.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Bank to Handle Foreign Sales Exchange Settlements Starting Next Month</h3>

In the past, the most exported goods from Taiwan Province were tea, sugar, and camphor. Most of them were transported to Hong Kong. Because there are no branch institutions of the four banks, none of them were settled.</p>

<h3>Owed Japanese Reparations in Kind - Total Amount Still Not Determined - Executive Yuan's Reparations Committee Disagrees</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] A responsible person from the Executive Yuan's Reparations Committee, in response to reporters' questions regarding "Why has China only received 780,000 tons of Japanese priority reparations in kind, considering China was the main country in the war against Japan? Why is it only enjoying such a meager allocation? What will the government say about this? Will it propose a re-allocation?" stated: (1) The total amount of Japanese reparations in kind was stipulated in the Far Eastern Commission to reduce Japan's war-making capability. Except for production needed to maintain a specified standard of living for the Japanese people, all other industrial equipment should be used for reparations. The amount of production that Japan should retain is still under discussion, and no formal conclusion has been reached, so the total amount of reparations has not been specifically defined. (2) The percentage of reparations in kind allocated to each country has been discussed several times at meetings of the Far Eastern Commission, but no agreement has been reached. However, so far, all countries have proposed that China should get the highest percentage, with figures ranging from 23% to 29%. China has consistently demanded 40%, and discussions are still ongoing. (3) Regarding the early dismantling of materials, the United States, considering the unresolved dispute over the allocation to each country, and that the reparations in kind would rust and deteriorate over time, issued an emergency directive based on the authorization of the Far Eastern Commission. The directive stipulated that 30% should be allocated for early dismantling and reparations within the temporary dismantling scope, of which China would receive 15%. In fact, China has already taken half of the early dismantling materials, more than any other country. The specified percentages were originally calculated based on value, but because valuation was not possible at the time, it was stated that the calculations would initially be based on "quantity" or "production capacity," with implementation to follow. However, in reality, the relationship between "quantity" and "production capacity" varies greatly depending on the type of machinery. For example, modern high-speed steam turbines are very light but have extremely high power generation capacity, while old-fashioned low-speed steam engines are very heavy but have very low power generation capacity, and their values ​​also differ greatly. Therefore, China's early dismantling reparations in kind should account for 15% of the materials listed in the temporary reparations plan, calculated by price. However, to facilitate immediate execution, applications for dismantling can be made based on production capacity or tonnage first.</p>
<p>In summary, the total amount of reparations in kind that China should receive has not yet been determined. However, China has resisted the longest and suffered the greatest damage. According to fair standards, it should receive the largest share of Japan's total reparations. The actual amount China receives in early dismantling reparations in kind may differ from the 15% based on value. The generally reported figure of 780,000 tons of materials seems to be based on assuming that the total reparations in kind are 5.2 million tons, and then calculating 15% of that amount.</p>
<h3>Government Officials Hold Meetings - Discuss Policy Decisions on the Current Situation - Wang Shijie Reports on Foreign Affairs at the Meeting</h3>

<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 27th] Foreign Minister Wang, attending a meeting of the Political Participation Council's Standing Committee, responded to questions about the Macau issue, stating: Since the Political Participation Council passed a resolution requesting the government to recover Macau, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has begun negotiations with the Portuguese Envoy Ye. He verbally requested the return of Macau and pointed out to the Portuguese Envoy that Portugal's reputation during the war was not good.

(2) Does the Portuguese government acknowledge the principle of reasonable national ideology? It is hoped that the Portuguese government can abandon its privileges and return Macau to China, but the Portuguese Envoy only said: "I cannot sign a reply now."</p>

<h3>Preparations for the Imminent Flood Control Project Proceeding Rapidly - Yellow River Dike Repairing Day and Night - All Sections in Shandong Province Can Be Completed Next Month</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] After the completion of the Yellow River's Huayuankou closure, the dike repair project is very arduous. Considering the upcoming flood season, the Ministry of Water Resources is now directing the Yellow River Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau to supervise the Hebei, Shandong, and Henan Three-Province Repair Offices, mobilizing workers and collecting materials to repair the dikes day and night. Currently, the dike repair work in Shandong involves approximately 80 kilometers, which can be divided into several sections: (1) The upper section from Zhukou to Zhuang has already completed 80% of the dike work and 90% of the dangerous works, and the entire section will be completed before the end of this month. (2) The middle section Daqi, from Zhuang to Ergaimin, and Kou to Zuoying have all been surveyed, and work is being actively carried out. The area below Shili is mostly mountainous, so the problem is smaller. It is now a shared vehicle area. In Hebei, the work involves approximately 70 kilometers, including: (1) Vigorously repairing the reinforcement work on two dangerous works from Gao Village to Liu Village. There is a collapse at Liu Village, which is being continuously repaired. Currently, there are 800,000 catties of shared materials, 750,000 blue bricks, 400,000 catties of willow branches, and 5,000 roots of wood. (2) The Mao Dian Xin Lian works and ditch dikes are scheduled to be completed before the big flood. (3) Strengthening the construction of the Fortress Old Juntang dam string project. In Henan, the work involves approximately 140 kilometers downstream from Huayuankou. The south bank repair work is progressing rapidly. The breaches at the Wuchekou and Donghongqiao sections of the main river channel have already been repaired. Regarding the allocation of funds for the entire restoration dike project: (1) Shandong has 29.3 billion, of which 18.67 billion has been allocated, (2) Henan has 19.4 billion, of which 13.26 billion has been allocated, (3) Hebei has 8 billion, of which 7.8 billion has been allocated.

<h3>UNRRA's Emergency Recommendations - Providing Special Steps for Consideration</h3>
<p>[This city news] A few days ago, UNRRA announced an emergency measures plan for preventing the Yellow River flood in July this year, calling on relevant authorities to pay attention to this serious issue and take active steps to accelerate the process. (See this newspaper on the 26th)</p>
<p>In the recommendation, UNRRA detailed the background of the disaster, analyzed the current crisis, suggested active cooperation work plans, and, from UNRRA's perspective, provided special steps for the government and the Communist Party to consider, which are described as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Background</p>
<p>In 1938, the Yellow River dike in Henan Province collapsed, and the flood flooded 2 million acres of fertile land, and the homes of millions of farmers were destroyed. Later, the war continued for years, and the dike could not be repaired. Every summer, the flood repeated, so that the rural areas of the flood area in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces could not be restored. When UNRRA studied the China Relief Plan, it planned to guide the Yellow River water into its pre-war old channel to restore the flood area, so that millions of farmers could return to their homeland and find ways to increase food production. The dikes were repaired every year before the war, but during the enemy's occupation, the dikes were gradually eroded and collapsed. Therefore, the Yellow River management plan must be divided into two parts: (A) Huayuankou dam closure project, (B) Dike restoration project on both sides of the Yellow River. The dangerous part is the section from Huayuankou to the sea, which is 400 miles long.</p>
<p>The initial plan was to carry out the dam closure and dike restoration projects simultaneously. After the Japanese surrendered, it was realized that another project needed to be carried out urgently, that is, 1.24 million farmers had moved to the riverbed since 1938 and built villages, hindering the dike restoration and dam closure projects. Therefore, it was necessary to relocate and relieve these refugees. The complicated and difficult point is that the dam closure project is in the government-controlled area, and most of the dike restoration project is in the Communist-occupied area. When the Kuomintang-Communist negotiations were about to break down and the war zone expanded, the situation was unclear, making it difficult to transport workers and materials. Subsequently, the Executive Headquarters, the Water Conservancy Commission, and representatives of the Communist Party consulted several times, and UNRRA personnel were invited to participate in the discussions. Most of the meetings were held between July and November 1946, and January, February, and March 1947. The agreement was as follows: (A) The Water Conservancy Commission is responsible for assigning sufficient technical supervision, materials, and funding for the dike restoration project in the Kuomintang and Communist areas; (B) The Executive Headquarters is responsible for the relocation and relief of residents in the riverbed in the Kuomintang and Communist areas; (C) UNRRA's China Office will provide equipment and allocate personnel to assist in the dike restoration and relief work; (D) The Communist Party is responsible for mobilizing workers. In February and March 1947, the dam closure project entered the final stage. Unfortunately, the war zone in Shandong expanded, and without special measures, the dike restoration project would be difficult to achieve. The former Director of UNRRA's China Office, Egerton, specially suggested to the government that the entire Yellow River riverbed be declared a truce area, so that the dike restoration project could be completed smoothly, and requested the Communist Party representative in Shanghai to inquire with the Communist Party leaders about their opinions on this suggestion. However, the Communist Party did not reply. On the government side, Chief of Staff Chen of the Ministry of National Defense issued orders to the local Kuomintang commanders, instructing them not to interfere with the workers in the Yellow River area and to protect them. However, the people in the Communist area trusted the propaganda and believed that the government's dam closure and river diversion had ulterior motives, and failed to cooperate. The situation has worsened recently, so UNRRA believes that without effective steps, it will not be possible to prevent the disaster of the flood season.</p>
<p>(B) The Restrictions of the Civil War on the Dike Restoration Project</p>
<p>Due to the failure to fully comply with various understandings, relief supplies and Executive Headquarters and UNRRA personnel were attacked by the Communist army in the border area between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. In the Communist area, UNRRA personnel were kidnapped by the Communist army, severely questioned, and often threatened with death. The Communist army also made unreasonable demands to UNRRA personnel to control the materials for special purposes. Due to the obstruction of the war, the travel and inspection of workers and the transportation of materials were greatly affected. The Yellow River riverbed and adjacent areas must be completely in a truce for six weeks, and urgently needed materials must be imported, otherwise the project cannot be completed, and the peach flood cannot be stopped. According to UNRRA engineer and Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission consultant Todd, according to the pre-determined agreement on payment of construction funds, it is necessary to transport 5,000 tons of flour and 20 billion national currency to complete the project in the Communist area.</p>
<p>(C) UNRRA's Recommendations</p>
<p>In order to save the Yellow River from flooding, the current steps that should be taken are: (1) Since the government and the Communist Party cannot directly negotiate at present, UNRRA should negotiate separately and ask both parties to immediately issue orders to stop military operations within five miles along the entire Yellow River from Huayuankou downstream from mid-June to late July; (2) The Chief of Staff of the Ministry of National Defense should issue an order to the local military authorities, instructing them to protect the safety and passage of UNRRA materials and personnel; (3) An emergency supply plan should be drafted and approved for implementation immediately; (4) Relevant agencies should resolutely complete the various dike construction works that should be carried out in their respective districts; (5) Explain the importance and significance of this emergency plan to the local residents, and persuade the residents of the Yellow River Delta to relocate as soon as possible to avoid repeating the water disasters they suffered before the war; (6) In order to promote and implement the above measures, the Executive Headquarters Water Conservancy Commission and UNRRA should each send several senior representatives to form a delegation to inspect the Communist area in western Shandong, to show that the government and UNRRA have decided to devote their full efforts to prevent the Yellow River flood, and to obtain the cooperation of the Communist army's responsible authorities; if all parties can cooperate effectively, UNRRA's China Office is prepared to fully support this work, in addition to providing materials, technical personnel, and relief workers, and will assist in mediation at any time to promote the work, supervise the project, and save the disaster.</p>

Six relatives of the murdered overseas Chinese here attended the redress committee to complain. At the same time, two women represented the families of the murdered and said to each other, "Heaven will punish you."</p>
<h3>Executive Headquarters Allocates 500 Million Yuan to Urgently Remit to Guangdong to Relieve Disaster Victims and Orders the Branch to Distribute All Stored Sugar</h3>
<p>[This newspaper news] In order to relieve the flood in Guangdong Province, the Executive Headquarters authorities specially allocated 500 million yuan yesterday and urgently remitted it to the Guangdong Branch for emergency relief.

The disaster area reached 33 counties and cities.</p>
<p>Causes of the Flood</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] According to relevant sources, the cause of the flood in South China this time is due to the abundant rainfall in each month of this year, which has increased the groundwater level.

By mid-June, it increased to a total of more than 400 millimeters, coupled with thunderstorms, which eventually led to an unprecedented flood. According to the Pearl River Water Conservancy Bureau, on the morning of June 1, the water level of Shilong in the northeast reached 11.03 meters, breaking the highest flood record in previous years. The foundations of the rivers collapsed, and the situation was very tragic. There were more than ten places such as Yanxiwei, Taipingwei, and Shilong Shitan on the East River, and many places such as Huayuan, Baitun, Huilong on the West River and many places such as Chenghai Changqiaocun front dike on the Han River, so the situation was extremely serious.</p>
<h3>Taiwan War Crimes Tribunal Trial: Xu Bing and Others' Conspiracy Case - Attempted Autonomy During Japan's Surrender</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 26th] The Taiwan Provincial War Crimes Tribunal convened at 9 AM today to try the case of Xu Bing, Gu Zhenfu, Jian Langshan, Lin Xiongxiang, and Xu Kunquan of Taipei City, who were accused of plotting rebellion in August of the 34th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1945]. According to the prosecutor's indictment, after Japan's unconditional surrender on August 15th of the previous year, the defendants Gu Zhenfu and others were incited by Major Nakamiya Goro and Yoshio Uezawa of the Japanese Army's Taiwan Garrison Headquarters on the 16th to form the "Taiwan Autonomy Committee." They drafted a plan for the organization and a list of committee members. On the 22nd, they met with the former Governor-General of Taiwan, Ando Rikichi, hoping to gain his support. However, when Ando met with them, he earnestly advised them not to act rashly, and especially not to create independence or autonomy movements. After hearing this, the defendants convened a meeting on the 24th of the same month, but besides reading Ando's statement twice, they did not discuss other matters, and the so-called autonomy proposal was also canceled. The case lasted only nine days from beginning to end. On the day when Zhenfu and others went to see Ando, the current Taiwan Provincial Government Committee member Du Congming and Senator Luo Wanbei also accompanied them. Furthermore, when the current Provincial Committee member Lin Xiantang led a delegation to pay respects to the motherland on August 31st of the previous year, Gu Zhenfu, Lin Xiongxiang, and Xu Bing, who are now defendants, were also members of the delegation. By February 21st of last year, when the five defendants, including Zhenfu, were charged, Japanese Army Majors Nakamiya Goro and Makizawa Yoshiten had already fled upon hearing the news, and their whereabouts remain unknown. During today's trial, Gu Zhenfu testified that Nakamiya did indeed discuss the matter of autonomy with him, but he immediately refused and did not participate in it. He also stated that he did not know what Nakamiya's intentions were. The other four defendants all denied ever being involved in the autonomy movement. When the judge asked them why they went to see Ando Rikichi, all five defendants stated, "A week after the Japanese announcement of surrender, the Governor-General had not yet issued a statement, and rumors were spreading in society. We went to see the Governor-General only to discuss how to maintain public order." The judge further asked, "If you had not been plotting autonomy beforehand, how would Ando have mentioned independence or autonomy?" The defendants all replied, "Ando's words may have been intended as a warning to Japanese soldiers like Nakamiya. There were also several Japanese officers and councilors present that day." Today was an investigative hearing, and no debate was held. The court adjourned at 1 PM. It is noted that Xu Bing and Jian Langshan once served as members of the Japanese House of Peers. Lin Xiantang was another Taiwanese who held such a position. Gu Zhenfu and Lin Xiongxiang had served as councilors of the Taiwan Governor-General's Office. Xu Kunquan was a businessman who had served as a translator for the Japanese army for two months.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 27th] The case of Ma Lianliang, which caused a sensation last year due to suspicions of treason, has been decided by the Hebei High Court to not prosecute.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>How Should We Cope with the New Stirrings of Prices?</h3>
<p>Recently, prices have once again shown signs of stirring, with rice, flour, grains, yarn, cotton, cloth, oil, sugar, silk, rayon, daily necessities, and other items all gradually rising; occasional small dips are followed by large increases. This trend was anticipated by most people before the festival. The reasons, in addition to the end of the festival season and the revival of commercial activity, include many stimuli: (1) the cancellation of subsidies for public utilities, leading to increases in water, electricity, and transportation fares; (2) the unfreezing of the cost of living index, resulting in increased wages in general; (3) the expansion of war zones and increased traffic congestion; (4) a large influx of idle funds from the north to Shanghai; (5) the formal cancellation of the Supervisory Group and the reorganization of the Shipping Control Committee, suggesting a gradual loosening of economic controls; (6) despite occasional tightening or loosening of credit, the trend of increasing issuance of currency shows no sign of stopping; and (7) rumors of new taxes and increased commodity taxes. At the same time, the measures to suppress prices are limited to the local rationing of rice in this city, the continued rationing of sugar, and the continued provision of in-kind benefits to public employees and teachers, with no other new measures in sight.</p>
<p>The economic reform plan proposed by the Executive Yuan on the 20th of this month, although broad in content, places stabilization of prices as the first item in the first annex. However, the proposed methods are mostly focused on fundamental and principled aspects, and are far less severe in terms of symptom management and emergency measures than the emergency economic measures of February 17th. It is not mentioned in the new plan whether various price stabilization measures stipulated in the emergency plan, such as price negotiation, price limits, and crackdown on hoarding, will continue to be implemented in the future, suggesting a complete shift to laissez-faire. Furthermore, considering the permission to raise prices for public utilities, the conditional unfreezing of the cost of living index, and the trend towards explicit recognition of import-export linkage systems, it is clear that future price controls will adopt more moderate measures.</p>
<p>Although suppressing prices is a common desire, what is the effect of rigid, high-pressure methods? The world already knows. Therefore, even though prices are fluctuating and the authorities are claiming to resolutely stop them, little attention seems to be paid to the revival or tightening of past price stabilization measures. The factors contributing to rising prices are extremely complex, but the most important is the lack of supplies. With more supply than demand, prices will naturally stabilize. This law of supply and demand must not be violated. Therefore, although the various measures to increase production proposed in the new plan are inevitably protracted and difficult to achieve in the near future, there is still much material available for us to re-examine in this time of rising prices.</p>
<p>First of all, it is worth mentioning the various measures to directly assist production, such as: improving the industrial environment, guaranteeing industrial profits, supplying raw materials to manufacturers, and striving for reasonable wages. Indeed, the people's pursuit of profit is like water flowing downwards. As long as there is profit to be made, even if it means violating prohibitions and breaking the law, someone will risk danger and overcome difficulties to pursue it. How much more so in legitimate production activities? The reason why production is shrinking day by day and why entrepreneurs are hesitant to move forward is known to everyone, and everyone can talk about it. Therefore, how should the industrial environment be improved? How should industrial profits be guaranteed? And how should raw materials be supplied? How should wages be rationalized? We sincerely hope that the government will act immediately, come up with practical and concrete measures, and have the courage to implement them. Directly promoting production is indirectly suppressing prices. Otherwise, the original plan's call to stabilize employment, prevent unemployment, and provide maximum protection to existing production industries will remain empty promises and will not have any practical effect!</p>
<p>Secondly, there are measures to facilitate production activities, such as: promoting production through various loans or order placement methods; encouraging trade by maximizing the convenience of water, land, and air transportation; developing import and export business by adopting import-export permit linkage methods; organizing a Reconstruction Finance Corporation to invest long-term funds in industrial and mining construction projects; and adjusting various taxes and simplifying tax collection procedures to suit the current economic environment. Although these measures do not directly promote production, they indirectly contribute to the development of production activities. In other words, the reason why production activities have not been able to develop is that the above measures have not been implemented, or conversely, they have encountered various negative obstacles. For example, regarding loans, the new plan explicitly acknowledges the existence of unreasonable methods such as pre-deducting interest and arbitrarily collecting handling fees. The hidden losses in export foreign exchange settlement and the difficulty in obtaining import foreign exchange have caused overseas remittances to be evaded and smuggling to be rampant, bringing legitimate import and export trade to a standstill. Furthermore, the difficulty of long-term financing, the deep-rooted malpractices of taxation, and the use of political power to facilitate private enterprises, resulting in the destruction of legitimate private industry and commerce, are all frankly admitted in the new plan. If these long-standing malpractices are not addressed with swift and effective action, production activities will be difficult to develop, and prices may not fall.</p>
<p>Thirdly, there are measures that directly contribute to stabilizing prices, such as: supplying cities with surplus materials; selling surplus materials; implementing rationing systems; absorbing idle funds with high interest rates; and, as mentioned earlier, supplying raw materials to manufacturers and adopting order placement methods. If the above methods can be implemented separately, the supply will be sufficient, and the channels for sales will be open, and the trend of speculation and hoarding can be gradually suppressed. Among the new plan, only the above items are considered to have relatively immediate effects. They are considered appropriate measures for stabilizing prices, and may even be far superior to rigid controls.</p>
<p>Now that this plan has been drafted and proposed by the Executive Yuan and has been submitted for review, at this time of price stirrings, we hope that it will be decided upon soon, and that the parts related to production and prices will be quickly translated into reality, so as to stabilize life and order. We feel that the government's response to this emergency situation seems a bit too calm. In peacetime, this might be appropriate, but at present, it should have the courage, perseverance, and decisiveness to make quick decisions. We also clearly know that this problem is too complex to be solved by a single method or even a single plan. However, having a method is better than having no method, and having a plan is better than having no plan. Since past control methods have been proven ineffective by the facts, and the authorities are determined to change, then we cannot help but expect this new plan to achieve a late success. The General Assembly of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will hold a meeting this afternoon to discuss a joint proposal requesting the speedy implementation of this plan to rescue the economic crisis, which is also a reflection of public opinion.</p>

<h3>Foreign Ministers Meeting at French Foreign Ministry - Reviewing the Marshall Plan - Europe's Potential Division Faces Test</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 27th] The foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and France began discussing the outline of the European Recovery Program meeting at the French Foreign Ministry at 4 PM on the 27th. Although the Secretary of State will not attend this "Marshall Plan Meeting," it is generally believed that it is the final consideration of whether Europe will be divided into a Western European group and a Soviet group.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 27th] British and American authorities stated today that after negotiations this week between British officials and US Undersecretary of State Clayton, a "broad conclusion of the nature" has been reached, believing that the Marshall European Recovery Plan should be carried out outside of the United Nations framework. British Foreign Minister Bevin will propose at today's Paris Tripartite Foreign Ministers Meeting that a separate agency be established outside the United Nations framework to handle the matter. This method is considered the best, because Germany has not participated in the United Nations organization, but its industrial capacity is a major cornerstone of any European recovery plan. It is heard that the Soviet side advocates that the US European Recovery Plan should be handled through the United Nations organization.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 27th] The French Foreign Ministry officially announced that the meeting of the foreign ministers of Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to discuss the Marshall European Aid Plan is scheduled to officially open on Friday evening at the French Foreign Ministry. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov arrived in Paris this morning and continued his visit to Mr. Bidault this afternoon. Mr. Bidault personally went to the  Stone Airport to greet Mr. Molotov this morning. When Mr. Bevin arrives in Paris tomorrow morning, Mr. Bidault will also personally go to the airport to welcome him. Since US Treasury Secretary Snyder stated yesterday that the Marshall Plan has not promised to provide loan assistance to any European recovery plan, the success of the Paris talks seems to have very little certainty. An official from the French Foreign Ministry expressed extreme surprise at Mr. Snyder's remarks, stating that the French government must study his remarks in detail before expressing its opinion. The Paris talks are being held in an extremely urgent state. The rapid invitation of Bevin and Bidault and the acceptance by Molotov without waiting for the agenda to be decided proves that the foreign ministers of the three countries all hope to quickly reach an agreement to adapt to the US aid plan and enable the US Congress to take action before the recess or the start of the presidential election. At the beginning of the Paris talks, US Deputy Secretary of State Clayton will also be in Paris, ready to hold meetings with any of the foreign ministers if necessary. At the same time, Secretary Mitter of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe is also in Paris, ready to implement the Marshall Plan using the United Nations organization if the three foreign ministers decide.</p>
<p>[France Press Agency, Paris, 26th] Responsible persons here stated that the Soviet Union is now trusting the words and plans of the United States, and is earnestly studying the European Recovery Plan with Great Britain and France, so as to submit it to Washington. Although Soviet newspapers have many suspicious words about the Marshall Plan, Foreign Minister Molotov has led a delegation of 89 people to Paris. The primary task of the tripartite foreign ministers meeting to be held at the French Foreign Ministry is to draft this recovery plan. The future of the meeting is naturally full of difficulties, because every economic problem in Europe has political relations. This political problem was raised and discussed at the Moscow conference, which lasted seven weeks and could not be resolved. Therefore, in this Paris meeting, which will only last a few days, there is little hope of resolution. It should be known that various problems are interrelated. It is impossible to discuss the European problem without involving Germany, and it is impossible to discuss German industry without involving European security issues. The elimination of the Nazis cannot be separated from the economic system. The complexity of the situation can be imagined from this.</p>
<h3>Dubious Remarks by Snyder Spark Concerns: Truman Clarifies Position, Dispelling Discord Between Marshall and Snyder</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 26th] President Truman declared at a press conference on the 26th that Secretary of State Marshall and Secretary of the Treasury Snyder were not at odds regarding the European Recovery Program. He stated that he and Marshall were in complete agreement, and that he, Marshall, and Snyder were also in complete accord. Truman's statement aimed to dispel rumors of discord between Marshall and Snyder. Snyder had stated on the morning of the 25th that Marshall's plan did not mean the United States was asking countries to submit their aid requests. Snyder had already retracted his statement by the afternoon of the 25th and corrected his remarks made earlier in the day at a press conference that same afternoon. Regarding whether the United States would implement the Marshall Plan with money or goods, Truman replied to reporters that the Secretary of State had already clearly</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 26th] Snyder's remarks, stating that the Marshall Plan did not obligate the United States to provide financial assistance, have raised two questions: (1) Does the entire U.S. government fully support Marshall's plan as presented at Harvard, and have European countries enthusiastically responded to it? (2) Is the government embarrassed by the excessive expectations of other countries regarding the Marshall Plan? The most reliable opinions affirm the first question, but the second is more difficult to answer.</p>
<p>When Marshall met with reporters yesterday, one asked, "Is the Marshall Plan understood to be a government plan?" Marshall replied in the affirmative. However, today's New York "Wall Street Journal" seems to disagree with Marshall. The newspaper stated that senior government officials are divided on whether to implement the massive Marshall Plan. They disagree on the urgency of providing aid, the amount of aid needed, the methods for requesting loans, and whether it is politically appropriate to pursue any expensive plan to achieve progress. The newspaper believes that the final decision on approving the Marshall Plan rests with Congress.</p>
<h3>French Cabinet Supports Bidault in Discussing Marshall Plan</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] London, 27th (Broadcast): The French Cabinet unanimously approved on Friday the policy to be advanced by Foreign Minister Bidault at the Three Foreign Ministers Conference.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union's Bumper Harvest This Year May Influence World Politics</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Moscow, 27th] This year marks the first bumper harvest in the Soviet Union since the Nazi invasion, which will significantly impact Molotov's discussions on the European Recovery Program in Paris. Reports of bumper harvests are coming from all regions of the Soviet Union, with yields in the "breadbasket" of Ukraine and Belarus exceeding expectations. Observers believe that the Soviet Union's bumper harvest will affect the development of the world economy and politics: (1) If the Soviet Union can supply grain to European countries, the latter will not need to seek assistance from other countries. (2) As a result of the first point, Eastern European countries can maintain an independent stance and adopt a unified and strong attitude when discussing the European Recovery Program. (3) The Soviet Union may export surplus grain to Western and Northern European countries, reducing their dependence on the United States, which may also include Britain (note: a British trade delegation is currently in Moscow negotiating the purchase of large quantities of Soviet grain). (4) The development of the Soviet grain trade further strengthens the Soviet Union's economic position in the world market.</p>
<h3>Yugoslavia Prepares to Participate in Discussions on U.S. Aid to Europe Plan</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Yugoslav Capital, 26th] The Yugoslav News Agency has announced that the Yugoslav government has notified the governments of Britain, the Soviet Union, and France that Yugoslavia is prepared to participate in preliminary discussions regarding the Marshall Plan for the recovery of Europe.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of U.S. Gasoline to be Shipped to South Korea</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 27th] According to an announcement from Seoul today, the United States plans to import large quantities of gasoline and fuel into Korea in 1948. According to the plan, the U.S. intends to import 5,460,000 tons of gasoline, kerosene, diesel, and lubricating oil, and 1,178,000 pounds of fats and oils into the southern part of the peninsula next year. The import of these materials will enable 10,000 Korean trucks to operate and provide light to 2.6 million Korean households. Kerosene will be used to supply the small number of Korean fishing boats.</p>
<h3>MacArthur on the Japanese Peace Treaty: Insists it Must be Concluded Within 18 Months; Predicts Japan Will be Able to Obtain Foreign Loans After Signing</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 27th] MacArthur, meeting with a group of 16 American journalists traveling around the world on the afternoon of the 27th, stated that the Japanese peace treaty must be concluded within 18 months, regardless of the circumstances. He added that if there were no obstacles from the Soviet Union, the treaty could be completed within a year, and he would return to the United States immediately after the treaty was signed. MacArthur stated that the failure to conclude the Japanese peace treaty sooner was costing the United States one million dollars a day. After the withdrawal of the U.S. occupation forces from Japan, the United Nations must have the ability to control Japan; otherwise, the United Nations would be powerless to handle any world events. If the United Nations cannot assume responsibility for guiding Japan, then it can only ask the eleven-nation Far Eastern Commission or some of its member nations to assume it.</p>
<p>He stated that after the withdrawal of the occupation forces, Japan must be subject to non-military supervision for at least a generation, and that Japan would not be a threat to world peace again for a hundred years. The important problems currently facing the United States and the world are how to revive the Japanese economy and help it boost its export trade. He also predicted that Japan would be able to borrow foreign loans after the peace treaty was signed.</p>
<p>China-Japan Relations</p>
<p>When asked what impact the situation in China would have on Japan, MacArthur replied that it was unfortunate for Japan, as the two countries should have normal and strong economic ties. Reviewing the situation in Japan, MacArthur stated that militaristic thinking was deeply rooted, and that before the war, 70 million people were controlled by 10 million, with the lives of the former being little different from those of slaves. He also pointed out that Japan urgently needed to solve problems related to food and fertilizer.</p>
<p>The Fate of East Asia</p>
<p>MacArthur concluded that Japan is the center of the world stage, and that the fate of one billion people in East Asia for centuries to come will depend on efforts to democratize Japan. If there is no outside interference, the United States will succeed in Japan. The progress of democratization in Japan has been very successful and continues to progress. Japan may be the most recent democracy, but it will undoubtedly be a good democratic system.</p>
<h3>Soviet Participation in Three Foreign Ministers Conference: U.S. Ambassador to Britain Expresses Optimism, Saying All Countries Should Eliminate Feelings of Animosity</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 26th] U.S. Ambassador to Britain Douglas, addressing the American Chamber of Commerce here this afternoon, expressed optimism regarding the Soviet Union's participation in the conference of the Foreign Ministers of Britain, the Soviet Union, and France to discuss the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe. He stated: "The Soviet Union has decided to participate in the Paris conference of the three Foreign Ministers and to discuss the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe in a spirit of full cooperation. This will simplify our work and give us greater confidence in the success of the conference. There is no reason why all countries cannot work together to promote the recovery of all countries affected by the devastation of the world war. However, the recovery of Europe cannot be achieved if countries incite fear and animosity among their peoples. I cannot help but hope that all countries will cooperate to solve various problems. As for Britain and the United States, we are cooperating in international finance and should move forward together, cooperating with countries that share the same lofty ideals. This has been the case in the past, and it will continue to be so in the future."</p>
<h3>Guam Requests Compensation for Wartime Losses</h3>
<p>Expected to Receive $10 Million</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th] Commander Maud of the Judge Advocate General's Corps told reporters today that the people of Guam are seeking approximately $14 million in compensation for wartime damages. The U.S. Navy estimates that $10 million will be paid as compensation. The damages include personal injuries and property losses inflicted by Japanese and U.S. forces during the battle for Guam, as well as damages resulting from Japanese atrocities.</p>
<h3>Acheson, MacArthur's Advisor, Declares Japan Will Receive Economic Assistance; U.S. Journalist Says Japanese Still Have Totalitarian Ideas</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 27th] Acheson, Chairman of the Allied Council for Japan and advisor to MacArthur, gave a speech at the American School here today, expressing his belief that Japan will become a cooperative member of the international community. He stated: "We have lived, studied, and worked under the leadership and inspiration of MacArthur. MacArthur is a soldier and a statesman, one of the great figures in American history. MacArthur's decisions address chaos with order, and another wise and far-sighted policy adopted by MacArthur is to prohibit interference in ordinary administrative measures, except where necessary. Some foreign newspapers believe that this move is tantamount to supporting conservative forces, which is a misconception. The United States will continue to exert a favorable influence, and Japan will receive financial and economic assistance to become self-sufficient. I am optimistic about Japan's future."</p>
<p>[United Press, Kyoto, 26th] A United Press journalist recently accompanied Major General Wooten L. Lasche, commander of the U.S. First Corps, on an extensive tour of the occupied areas. U.S. military officials unanimously believe that reforms are minimal in the densely populated areas of southwestern Japan and that they must be supervised by the Allied forces for several years or even 30 years to be effective. It is said that the people have undergone considerable changes since the U.S. military entered Japan, but they have not fundamentally severed ties with their past totalitarianism. If the U.S. military withdraws, Japan will return to the rule of its former masters. The control mechanisms in Tokyo are insufficient to provide a guarantee for continued democratization. The northern and southern halves of the peninsula are mainly agricultural and industrial, respectively. Some wartime factories are allegedly being used to produce agricultural implements to avoid paying reparations. Equality and constitutional government are alien concepts to the Japanese people and are expected to develop only slowly. Although they are eager to learn new American ideas, they still adhere to old customs and obey the feudal class.</p>
<h3>Japan Again Attempts to Covet the Yaeyama Islands; The Islands Are Actually Chinese Territory</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 27th] Since Foreign Minister Ashida made a statement expressing his hope to reclaim territories such as the Ryukyu and Kuril Islands, it has aroused strong reactions from various countries. Newspapers here have also published reports of a temporary motion by the Shanghai Municipal Council, transmitted by China's Central News Agency, expressing absolute opposition to the Japanese administration of the Ryukyu Islands to the government. However, the Japanese government and public do not relax their efforts, and opinions are frequently published in newspapers. The "Sekai Nippo" here recently published a special article entitled "Today's Problem," discussing the matter and quoting the entire report on the occupation of the Ryukyu Islands published by MacArthur's chief of staff, Weaver, on the 11th of this month, intending to falsely attribute Ashida's delusional attempt to MacArthur's headquarters. The article cited Instruction No. 156 issued by the Naval Military Government (referring to the Ryukyu Islands) on April 22, 1946, establishing the Okinawa Central Government and organizing an advisory council composed of Okinawan natives as directors. Ashida and the general Japanese public used this to believe that the United States intended to return administrative power over Okinawa to the Japanese. In the Yaeyama Islands, the governor of the islands is also encouraging local residents to demand that the islands be incorporated into the Okinawa Central Government. In fact, the Yaeyama Islands and the Ryukyu Islands should not be confused. The Yaeyama Islands are actually an integral part of China's inherent territory. Among Japanese historians, there are not a few who acknowledge this fact. As for the Ryukyu issue, it was discussed at the Cairo Conference, and it is expected that there will be a debate on the issue at the future peace conference with Japan. Ashida's raising of this issue at this time is likely due to excessive nervousness after reading the report of MacArthur's headquarters. Our government and the general public should also prepare early before this issue arises to avoid being taken advantage of by the Japanese.</p>
<h3>Australia to Protest Japanese Mining on Palau Island</h3>
<p>Japanese Antarctic Whaling Fleet to Depart Soon</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 26th] The Australian government is about to lodge a most serious protest against MacArthur's headquarters' permission for the Japanese government to take over the mining of phosphate on Angaur Island in the Palau Islands of the South Pacific. The island is the closest to Australia among the Japanese mandated islands. A senior Australian official here stated that MacArthur's action was the most unbelievable action. The official pointed out that Angaur Island was a mandated island of the League of Nations and was not within the scope of MacArthur's headquarters' authority. The Allied Council for Japan was not informed of this decision by MacArthur's headquarters. Angaur Island was one of the bases for the U.S. military's counterattack against the Philippines.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 26th] A whaling fleet of 15 ships, led by the 11,000-ton mother ship " Nisshin Maru No. 1," will soon sail to the Antarctic Ocean. " Nisshin Maru No. 1" participated in the first Antarctic whaling operation last year.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Mobilizes Youth for Industrial Training</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Moscow, 26th] An official gazette published here today stated that the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has ordered the mobilization of a large number of young people. All men aged 19 must be part of the labor reserve force for coal mines and heavy industry. Previously, the maximum age stipulated was 17; now it has been raised to 19. The minimum age will likely be set at 15. In addition, boys aged 14 to 17 and girls aged 15 to 16 will be trained in commercial and railway schools. It is estimated that after implementing this measure, 425,000 more boys and girls will receive this training this year.</p>
<h3>Perilous Situation in the Dutch East Indies: Sjahrir Forced to Resign; Overseas Chinese in Indonesian Areas Ordered to Relocate</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Yogyakarta, 27th] After Sjahrir's resignation, Indonesian Republic President Sukarno has assumed full presidential powers to deal with the government crisis. Sukarno personally signed the response to the recent supplementary memorandum proposed by the Dutch today. Although the contents are unknown, reliable sources believe that he will reject Sjahrir's recent recognition of Dutch East Indies Governor General Van Mook's legal status in the interim federal government and suggest that while Van Mook should be a member of the government, he should not have the right to vote.</p>
<p>[United Press, Indonesian Capital, 27th] Indonesian Republic President Sukarno took over the government today after accepting Prime Minister Sjahrir's resignation. Sjahrir resigned due to political disagreements during an all-night cabinet meeting, which was accepted. The President instructed the old cabinet members to remain temporarily until a new cabinet is formed. On the day of Sjahrir's resignation, various Indonesian political parties were united in opposing his policy of making concessions to the Netherlands to avoid armed conflict. Sukarno is scheduled to respond to the final Dutch note today, opposing further concessions. According to those around the President, Sjahrir will remain as acting Foreign Minister until a new cabinet is formed. Neutral observers believe that the downfall of the Sjahrir cabinet symbolizes the failure of the Indonesian moderates and foreshadows a breakdown in negotiations between Indonesia and the Netherlands, which may lead to military action. Dutch officials here today did not comment on Sjahrir's resignation, while an Indonesian spokesman said, "Only a miracle can save the Indonesian military from armed conflict with the Dutch military."</p>
<p>[United Press, Amsterdam, 26th] The pro-Communist Central Trade Union Federation of the Netherlands announced today that it has invited the Socialist Trade Union Federation to immediately discuss a general strike to be implemented if the reactionary Dutch troops attempt to resolve the Indonesian issue by force.</p>

<h3>Greece Suddenly Accuses Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania Before the Security Council</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 26th] As the Security Council reached a final decision on the Balkan issue, Greece suddenly made a surprising motion on the 26th, accusing Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania of international aggression. This accusation by Greece, based on the Charter, may be the most serious situation. Western countries may take measures against Greece's three northern neighbors that are more far-reaching than previously expected. Britain and the United States may have been notified in advance of Greece's action and endorsed it as the procedure for the Security Council's debate. If the Greek accusation is passed by a majority of countries and the Soviet Union does not use its veto, it could defeat the arguments of the three Balkan countries in the Security Council. However, the Soviet Union may use its veto to strike down this severe motion.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch] San Francisco, 27th (Broadcast): The U.S. representative to the United Nations accused Yugoslavia, Albania, and Bulgaria of aiding guerrillas in northern Greece, which "violates several basic principles of the United Nations Charter."</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 26th] Albania submitted a note to the Security Council today, stating that it cannot allow the United Nations investigation team to enter its territory arbitrarily. Yugoslavia and Bulgaria have also submitted similar notes.</p>
<h3>Austrian Foreign Minister Issues Statement: Determined to Fight for Independence and Freedom; Large Quantities of U.S. Food to be Shipped to Austria for Relief</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Vienna, 26th] Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber recently declared at a meeting of the People's Party Executive Committee: "Unless there are international guarantees that Austria will not become a vassal of communist-controlled neighboring countries and their governments, Austria will refuse to continue cooperating with these countries. The movement promoted by the Communist Party in the Balkans to establish close economic ties is meaningless, as these countries, after intensifying their industrialization, will lose their original function as food-exporting countries. If the government adopts a moderate policy toward the Austrian Communist Party, our political freedom will completely collapse. In short, the government will never sign treaties that endanger Austria's interests, but hopes to sign a peace treaty as soon as possible, as Austria's failure to achieve freedom will hinder its cooperation with major powers."</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 26th] A State Department spokesman announced today that the United States will ship eight vessels of grain to Austria from this week to the end of July.

<h3>U.S. Labor Law Bill: Truman Guarantees Implementation</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 26th] President Truman declared today: I will do everything in my power to ensure that the Taft-Hartley Labor Law Bill of Republican Senators Taft and Hartley is implemented. I earnestly request that both labor and management cooperate to maintain industrial peace and tolerate each other for the sake of national stability and the development of world peace. The new labor law bill was enacted after Congress overturned President Truman's veto. President Truman had called it "impracticable," and in the past few days, several groups, in view of the bill's passage, have demanded that President Truman not obstruct its implementation because of his opposition to the bill.</p>
<p>General Strike Avoided</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 26th] After emergency consultations with the Executive Committee of the American Federation of Labor, President Green has decided not to accept the requests from local unions for a general strike to protest the new labor law bill, but will instead fight the bill through legal channels. Green also said that the American Federation of Labor will engage in political organizing to defeat members of Congress who supported the bill.</p>

<h3>President Truman Vetoes Wool Bill</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Special Dispatch, Washington, 26th] President Truman today vetoed another important bill passed by Congress (namely the Wool Bill), marking the third time this month that Truman has overturned a Congressional bill. The Wool Bill stipulates that restrictions should be further imposed on the import of wool. After refusing to approve the bill and returning it to Congress, Truman submitted a message stating that enacting this bill at a time when the United States and seventeen countries are negotiating in Geneva to eliminate trade barriers is a "deplorable mistake." If passed rashly, foreign countries will inevitably believe that the United States is tending towards a return to "economic isolationism." After the U.S. Senate accepted Truman's veto, it immediately returned the original proposal to the Agriculture Committee. Meanwhile, the House of Representatives today submitted another similar bill, without import restrictions, to the Senate for consideration. This bill, passed by the House of Representatives, authorizes the President to regulate the import volume of wool and impose import taxes to raise domestic wool prices to near the government-supported prices.</p>
<h3>French Labor Unrest Spreads; Cabinet's Position Gradually Shaken; Hope for Resolution of Coal Mine Labor Unrest</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 27th] The French Cabinet is scheduled to meet today to discuss the agreement reached between the Ministry of Industrial Production and representatives of coal miners. A resolution to the labor unrest of 250,000 coal miners in northern France is in sight. If Prime Minister Ramadier approves, workers are expected to return to work immediately. The agreement stipulates that each worker will be paid a production bonus of 60 francs per day, and working hours will also be reduced. The strike of bank employees nationwide will also be one of the topics for discussion by the Cabinet today. 40,000 textile workers, who began work slowdowns yesterday, have declared that they will strike completely today if their request for production bonuses is not accepted. 200,000 workers at the Talron automobile factory continue their strike. 1,000 construction workers in La Rochelle have launched a strike. 300,000 metalworkers have also threatened to strike on Monday over the issue of production bonuses. Under the dual pressure of members of Congress and workers, the position of the French Cabinet is wavering. Former Socialist Prime Minister Blum acknowledged in "Le Populaire" that his policy of suppressing prices, launched in December of last year, has failed.</p>

<h3>Canada Considers Independence from Britain; Policy Gradually Becomes Clear</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Ottawa, 26th] Qualified observers here recently commented that Canada's policy of seeking independence is now gradually becoming clear.

<h3>U.S. Rapidly Implementing Foreign Relief Plan; Person in Charge, Allen, Departs for Europe</h3>
<p>[American News, Washington, 26th] The State Department announced today that the purchase of supplies under the U.S. $350 million foreign relief plan authorized by Congress has now begun, and a ship bound for Austria is already loading cargo. While Congress was still considering the appropriation of $350 million, the necessary work before the actual shipment of relief supplies had already begun rapidly under the Congressional authorization bill. The House Appropriations Committee began hearing discussions on the appropriation plan on Wednesday to submit the bill to Congress for passage. At the same time, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation prepaid $75 million for operating expenses. The allocation of this funding, contained in the appropriations bill, was transferred to the State Department on June 4. Within a week, this amount had been allocated to the relevant agencies for use. To date, a total of $17.15 million has been allocated, mostly for the purchase of European * food, much of which will be shipped to Austria, Venice, Giulia, and Italy. The person in charge of the plan, Allen, has completed the preparation work, including selecting the staff to implement the plan, and departed from Washington for Paris by air today. He will arrive in France on Friday evening, stay in Paris for three days to discuss relevant matters with various parties, and then go to Rome to establish a base of operations, preparing to stay there in the future to oversee the relief work. Countries with whom relief agreements have been established include Austria, Hong Kong, Italy, Greece, Hungary, Poland, and China. Relief supplies are limited to food, medical equipment, fuel, fertilizer, pesticides, seeds, and clothing fabrics. It is estimated that all supplies can be shipped starting at the end of 1947.</p>

<h3>Relieving the Housing Panic of Tens of Thousands of Households; Right to Lease Allotted Housing; Senate Firmly Advocates Extension; Principles for Handling Decided, Letter Sent to Municipal Government and District Court Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Due to the severe housing shortage in the city, the Municipal Senate resolved to find a solution during its First Session of the Second Congress. The Land Administration Committee of the Senate reviewed the results and decided on five principles for handling the issue. Yesterday, the Senate sent separate letters to the Municipal Government and the District Court, requesting that the lease rights of residents in allotted housing be extended in accordance with the Senate's resolution to avoid causing civil disturbance *. The reasons and measures stated in the Municipal Senate's official letter to the District Court are extracted as follows:</p>
<p>A. Reasons: In the First Session of the Second Congress of this Senate, it was noted that the housing shortage in the city is severe. Once the unified leasing method originally stipulated by the Executive Yuan expires, landlords will inevitably use this as an excuse to reclaim the properties. The original organizations, groups, military personnel, government employees, and teachers living in allotted housing will certainly be unable to relocate, thereby causing social unrest. Therefore, it was passed to extend the unified leasing period, which was sent to the government for investigation and handling. Among the landlords in the city, there are certainly not a few who can comply with the Senate's resolution, but there are also many who attempt to lease the properties to others after the expiration of the unified leasing period. There are even those who refuse to sign leases despite legal allocation by the government. As a result, disputes have arisen repeatedly, which is not a blessing for the city. Furthermore, after the victory, the government agencies in Shanghai responsible for receiving and allocating enemy and puppet-owned leased housing included the Japanese Residents Management Office, the Three-Service Military, the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Region, the Shanghai Municipal Government Materials Takeover Office, and the Executive Yuan Housing Allocation Committee for Various Agencies in Shanghai. At that time, the number of organizations, groups, military personnel, government employees, and teachers who were legally allocated housing and moved in was in the tens of thousands of households. If they were forced to relocate, how would these people find a place to live in the midst of this severe housing shortage? The government's takeover of enemy and puppet-owned leased housing was originally a result of the eight-year victory of the War of Resistance. What was taken over was the enemy and puppet's right to lease and sell, which does not conflict with the landlord's rights. This Senate, as a local public opinion organization, should urgently make a decision on a solution to this serious problem to uphold the prestige of the previous congress's resolution.</p>
<p>B. Measures: (1) This Senate should declare again that for all legally allocated housing by government agencies, landlords should sign contracts with the allottees who hold official allocation certificates; otherwise, they will be deemed to have forfeited the right to the rental income, and no litigation will be allowed. (2) Although the unified leasing period has expired, if the allotted tenants have no rent arrears or other illegal conduct, the landlords should continue to lease to the allottees, and others should not be allowed to compete for the properties. (3) The lease rights (claims) of all enemy and puppet-owned original leased housing should not be confused with the landlord's property rights (real rights), and they should not be discussed together as a basis for claims. Since the occupants have been legally allocated the housing by the government, the right to lease the housing for their residence and use has clearly been granted to the current occupants by the government. Having acquired the claim, the landlords may not lease to others. (4) This Senate requests the judicial authorities to pay attention to lawsuits related to housing legally allocated by government agencies and to make careful judgments to avoid increasing disputes by using the courts. If the regular occupants have no rent arrears or illegal conduct and are sued for eviction by the landlords on the grounds of having another lease, please consider Articles 71 and 72 of the Civil Code and, based on the previous resolutions of this Senate, presume that the contract is invalid and dismiss the lawsuit. In particular, please pay attention to applications for provisional execution. If the current occupants are unable to fulfill their obligation to pay rent due to the landlord's refusal to sign a lease, the current occupants should be allowed to deposit the rent with the court. (5) For all legally allocated housing where the landlords have sued for eviction and the initial trial has ruled for eviction, the judicial authorities should provide appropriate relief in the appellate trial.</p>

According to Wang, a group of hooligans claiming to be the Axe Gang, including Xi Linqing (nicknamed Xiaoxi), Chen Sanhe, Third Aunt, and Xun Shuangbao (also known as Laba), often came to the dance hall during their leisure time. At about 0:30 AM on the 21st, when it was raining heavily, after the dance hall closed, all the dancers and the group of hooligans were still there. Third Aunt was playing with a dancer named Lu Fei, and Wang Hanxiang dissuaded them, which led to a slight dispute between the two sides. After being persuaded by others that night, they dispersed. Unexpectedly, the next afternoon, when Xiaoduhui opened, Chen Sanhe led more than ten people, intending to assault them. Wang reported to the Xincheng Police Sub-bureau, which sent police to the scene, but they had already dispersed. At 10:30 PM that night, a waiter saw Chen lingering in a small room at the door. After he left, he entered the room and discovered a large knife and four iron hooks inside. On the evening of the 23rd, the hooligans came again to vandalize the neon lights in front of the dance hall, and so on. On the evening of the 25th, Xi Linqing and Chen Sanhe were arrested and interrogated.</p>

<h3>An Incestuous Case During the Enemy Puppet Period: Forcibly Indecent and Parricide Against Father's Concubine; Retrial Requested for Reduced Sentence</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The sensational parricide and incest case during the enemy puppet period was heard in the High Court yesterday, and the verdict is scheduled to be announced on July 2. The case involves Wu Tongfu, who is 21 years old this year and from Ningbo. His father, Wu Yongkang, opened a Western clothing store at No. 364 Xiafei Road, which was famous for making BMK brand raincoats. Although Wu Tongfu's environment was quite affluent, he was accustomed to depravity. At 8:00 PM on May 6, 1944, he sneaked into the bedroom of his father's concubine, Wu Xu. Seeing Xu lying on the bed, with her jade body exposed, lust arose in him. He attempted to commit indecent acts, but Wu Xu woke up and resisted strongly. Wu Tongfu, unable to succeed in his rape attempt, stabbed Wu Xu in the throat with a knife, severing her trachea, and she died instantly. Wu Tongfu was prosecuted for three crimes: theft, attempted rape, and murder. Subsequently, the puppet local court sentenced him to life imprisonment because he was over 18 years old. After the victory, the High Prosecutor's Office re-investigated the case, and a debate was opened in the High Court yesterday. According to the defendant, he is 21 years old this year and was not yet 18 years old at the time of the crime.

<h3>Star Island Kicks Star Union in Third Battle: 5-3 Victory</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Singapore Correspondent] Star Island's second leg of their European tour was a challenge in Singapore as scheduled. After arriving in Singapore, the team first drew 3-3 with the Singapore Chinese team in their first match. In the second match, they fought bravely and won 5-1 against the Military Union team. In the third encounter, they met the All-Star Union team. With the entire team fighting hard, the Tiger team once again reported victory with a score of 5-3. In fact, the Star Union team was quite valiant. The three forwards were particularly skilled. Xie Wenliang and He Yayi on the left side performed even better. Unfortunately, the whole team was not calm enough. Although they maintained a 1-1 draw in the first half, they could not hold on in the second half and eventually lost.</p>
<p>Feng Jingxiang and Zhu Yongqiang played the best for Star Island's forwards, while defenders Xu Jingcheng and Hou Rongsheng also showed their skills. The Tiger team played with a newly arranged lineup in this battle. Let's see how both sides deployed their troops:</p>
<p>Star Island</p>
<p>Liu Tianshen, Yu Yaode, Hou Rongsheng, Feng Kunsheng, Xu Jingcheng, Song Lingsheng, Liu Songsheng, Li Zhaorong, Zhu Yongqiang, Feng Jingxiang, Gao Shanlong</p>
<p>Singapore Union Team</p>
<p>Tong Bo, Lu Te, La Shou, Xia Nvfu, Wa Si, Li Simo, He Yayi, Xie Wenliang, Zhuo Zhenyu, Kang Shansai, Sha Madang</p>
<p>Union Takes the Lead First</p>
<p>After the whistle blew, the Union team launched a fierce attack. Tianshen repelled the enemy, and Sha Madang's shot went wide. Three minutes later, Jingxiang led a counterattack. Zhaorong's low shot was caught, and Gao Shanlong's fierce kick missed, just adding to the excitement. The Union team launched another urgent attack. Wenliang advanced alone, tricked Rongsheng, and passed the ball out. Zhenyu took the opportunity to shoot. Yu Yaode couldn't reach the ball and had to let the Union team score the first victory.</p>
<p>Equalizer</p>
<p>Wenliang came again, and Yayi shot wide, startling Yaode. Then the Tiger team counterattacked. Yongqiang dribbled along the sideline. Seeing the enemy defender chasing closely, he crossed the ball. Jingxiang reacted quickly, ran forward to meet it, and swept a shot from the ten-yard mark. The ball went crisply into the net. 1-1. Before the break, both sides fought hard to maintain the equal score.</p>
<p>Ending with 5-3</p>
<p>Changing formations and fighting again, Star Island's attack was very strong. Yongqiang and Songsheng scored one after another, leading 3-1. After nine minutes, "Divine Leg" flew in alone, tricked the goalkeeper, and pushed the ball into the net, making it 4-1, earning cheers from the entire stadium. After this setback, the Union team launched a full-scale advance. After fifteen minutes, the left wing took advantage of a misunderstanding between Rongsheng and Tianshen to score a goal, bringing it back to 4-2. In the last ten minutes, Yongqiang scored again for Star Island, while Wenliang turned around and shot the ball into the net in the chaos. Each side added one goal, and the game ended 5-3, with the Union team losing.</p>

If he wins, he will meet Australian second-ranked player Pierce in the semi-final week. This battle is Falk's most important test.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Wimbledon, 26th] There were no major upsets at the Wimbledon Tennis Championships today, but under the heat wave, some matches were quite intense, with players "sweating like rain." All seeded players have entered the final sixteen. The men's singles is gradually becoming a competition between the United States and Australia, like the Davis Cup consolation round. France still has three representatives led by the defending champion Dela. There is not a single Englishman among the final sixteen, indicating the low level of British tennis. Seven of the eight seeded players won in straight sets. Only Tom Brown defeated former British junior champion Baxter in four sets, 6-2, 6-2, 10-12, 6-4. Kramer defeated Italian Coselli 6-0, 6-2, 6-0. Australian Bromwich, Kramer's main rival, demonstrated the most perfect technique, defeating French Testra 6-1, 6-1, 6-1.

<h3>Table Tennis League Finals First Battle: Shanghai Star Defeats Hualianhua in Tense Match Ending 5-2</h3>
<p>The first battle of the second Shanghai Table Tennis League finals kicked off at 8:00 PM the night before at the Yokohama Bridge Central Auditorium. There were more than 600 table tennis fans in attendance, creating a lively atmosphere. Referees Shen Bohong and Chen Linsheng gave the order to start the match. The teams competing were Group A champion Shanghai Star against Group B runner-up Hualianhua. Hualianhua fought with the mentality of facing certain defeat but put up a surprisingly tense performance. Li Fei narrowly defeated Shanghai Star's new player Huang Zisong after a dramatic five-game battle. Veteran Zhou Weixin's short shots were divinely transformed, making the opponent's left-handed hard hitter Cheng Aixin almost flustered and unable to counterattack for a while. The former lightly defeated Cheng Aixin in straight sets, showing that the old general is still formidable. Shanghai Star's veteran Li Zongpei was absent, and Wang Changhou, who's known for his draws, was also not in top form. The impact on strength was significant. Ultimately, relying on the victories of veterans Chuan Qifang, Xue Xuchu, and Yu Cheng, as well as the contributions of Huang Gaoyuan and Huang Zhijun, they finally defeated Lianhua 5-2. Judging from this record, it was not outstanding. There are many strong opponents ahead. If Shanghai Star does not work hard, it may face the danger of an upset. There are no matches today. Tomorrow night (the 29th), Group C champion Hualian will meet Group C runner-up Postal B again. The results of the first final are recorded below:</p>
<p>(Shanghai Star) (Hualianhua) (Score)</p>
<p>Yu Cheng Gu Jinxiang 3-1</p>
<p>Fu Qifang Xu Zhifu 3-0</p>
<p>Xue Xuchu Liu Baotai 3-1</p>
<p>Cheng Aixin Zhou Weixin 0-3</p>
<p>Huang Gaoyuan Lu Yunzhang 3-0</p>
<p>Huang Zhijun Qin Yuheng 3-1</p>
<h3>Silver Coin Cup Table Tennis Tournament: China A Defeats Shanghai Trust</h3>
<p>In the first Silver Coin Cup Table Tennis Tournament, in the four matches the night before, Qian Group champion China A took advantage of their winning streak against Hangquan, defeating Shanghai Trust 13-3. The skills of veteran Zhu Yongkang and chopper Yuan Jingyun were fully displayed, and they were undoubtedly the soul of China A. In other matches, Jin Cheng and Zhe Xing were strong and reported victories. However, Dayu in the Silver Group forfeited in the first match, showing poor spirit. Their opponent, Jiao Tong, won without effort, making the trip very disappointing. Due to the settlement of accounts, it will be suspended for one week. The schedule for the next week will be announced separately. The results of the night before are recorded below.</p>
<p>China A Defeats Shanghai Trust (Qian Group) 13-3</p>

Tea sesame oil continued to rise by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, and the future situation still depends on the digestion in other ports.</p>
<p>Another message: In order to curb the rising tide of edible oil and crack down on speculators hoarding, the Social Affairs Bureau specially instructed the Third District Vegetable Oil Refining Industry Association yesterday, instructing its members to urge all customers to withdraw all goods previously sold on the stock certificate within ten days, otherwise they will be severely punished. After receiving the instructions, the association held an emergency meeting of members at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, and decided to comply with it from today.</p>
<p>It is also learned that yesterday's oil price rose by 40,000 yuan from the previous day due to the heavy absorption of raw oil from Guangdong. The prices of soybean oil rose by 10,000 yuan, and the prices of clear oil and sesame oil rose by 20,000 yuan each. In addition to the routine rotation of selling edible oil to 600 oil shops, the China Planting Oil Factory has also been selling a large amount of oil to the market in recent days, and the price is reduced by tens of thousands of yuan compared to the market price. Yesterday, it sold 1.145 dan of raw oil and 800 dan of soybean oil. A total of more than 20,000 dan has been sold this week, with Su oil accounting for the largest quantity. In view of the current fertilizer application season in rural areas, the factory also sold a large number of planting bean cakes yesterday, and each piece was also reduced by more than 4,000 yuan compared with the market price, reducing the burden on farmers.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Lennox Simoes Co., managed by Jardine Matheson, arrived in Shanghai from Vancouver yesterday, carrying 45,000 bags of calcium powder purchased by the China Trust Bureau, and docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf for unloading.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Trading is Sluggish; Factory-Processed Silk Goods are Priced Higher Than the Previous Day</h3>
<p>Yesterday, artificial silk prices declined again due to sluggish trading and a dispirited market sentiment. In the morning, lot 120 of Kosan Yuko (高山有光) was offered for sale at a minimum price of 2,378,000 yuan, but the noon closing price was 2,400,000 yuan. In the afternoon, the downward trend slightly reversed, with the highest price reaching 4,500,000 yuan, but the final asking price was 4,300,000 yuan, 70,000 yuan lower than the previous day. Lot 75 of Golden Rooster semi-luster silk also declined in price accordingly, with an asking price of 3,300,000 yuan, but there were few inquiries.</p>
<p>Although the market conditions for factory-processed silk goods were quiet yesterday, asking prices were about 2,000,000 yuan higher than the previous day. High-quality "Uniform Grade Five Ancestor Head" silks had no transactions. The previous day, there were transactions for 20 bales of foreign goods, at 560-thread count, priced at 3,500,000 yuan with a one-week forward contract. Yesterday, only odd-lot transactions occurred, with medium-grade goods priced between 3,100,000 and 3,200,000 yuan. Higher-grade odd-lot "C" grade split bales were priced at 3,350,000 yuan, and "D" grade split bales were priced at 3,200,000 yuan. The outlet for dry-processed silk was severely lacking, and market prices showed no improvement. Yesterday, there was an odd-lot transaction at 2,100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, silk goods, real silk bedding, and plaid "Bi" (璧) fabrics continued to rise in price. American Asiatic (美亞) bedding had very few orders, with asking prices reaching as high as 13,000,000 yuan. Dachen (大誠) bedding was not sold at 2,350,000 yuan. Huaqiang (華强) bedding was initially offered at 2,000,000 yuan, then the asking price was raised to 2,100,000 yuan. Dachen (大誠) plaid crepe opened at 43,000 yuan, but because there were more sellers than buyers, the price weakened and fell from 2,800-2,900 yuan to 2,600 yuan. After much support in the middle of the day, prices gradually rose, reaching 3,000 yuan, then closing at 3,700 yuan, with a forward price of 4,000 yuan, ultimately 400 yuan higher than the previous day. Huajin (華錦) crepe prices decreased by 1,000 yuan due to the lower price of artificial silk. Rayon (羅紡) prices were reported to be rising in the producing areas, and the Shanghai market increased by another 500 yuan yesterday, with a selling price of 16,000 yuan per tael.</p>
<h3>Multi-Party Incapacity to Support; Chinese Stocks Trend Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks experienced a high opening followed by a decline in Yong Yarn (永紗), as hopes for Sino-American loans diminished, and the forward delivery association (遞交會) set a new high price of 10,150 yuan. However, due to continued tight credit conditions and a discount rate of 4.5%, and because the forward delivery association's (遞交體金) cash deposit requires a 50% cash payment, scheduled to be implemented in the next session and announced within days, multiple parties were unable to provide further support. Trading was sparse, and the market showed weakness under the conditions of excessive supply, closing at a low price. However, small-cap stocks such as New Light (新光), China Silk (中絲), and American Asiatic (美亞) remained quite firm.</p>
<p>At the opening, stocks opened high due to reports that hopes for Sino-American loans were dwindling. After Yong Yarn (永紗) opened, lots 142, 76, 112, 129, and 22 all rose, reaching a new high of 10,150 yuan. Lots 85, 185, 224, 14, and 171 were liquidated at high prices, causing the price to fall to 9,700 yuan. Lots 173, 235, 32, and 76 were bought at the lower price of 9,850 yuan. Buying interest in lots 224, 117, 152, 142, and 180 returned, pushing the price down to 9,580 yuan. Lots 224, 197, 219, 157, and 216 were bought at the lower price of 9,750 yuan, and lots 152, 97, 213, 154, 155, and 112 were sold again at 9,570 yuan. Buying appetite for lots 169, 85, 235, 89, and 103 remained healthy, while lots 152, 231, 228, and 157 were sold, fluctuating between 9,550 yuan and 9,700 yuan. Lots 153, 218, 154, 36, 32, 235, and 76 entered the market, and the Hong Kong-Shanghai telegraph reached 10 yuan, rising to 9,880 yuan. Lots 231, 224, 85, and 234 were still liquidated at high prices, falling back to 9,650 yuan. Lots 117, 104, 190, 232, and 213 entered the market, and at 11:40, the price rose again to around 9,900 yuan. Lots 94, 76, 157, 224, 76, 155, 199, 231, 112, 217, and 36 were all liquidated, and news that a public announcement of a 50% cash guarantee would be issued within days and implemented from the next rollover date caused a severe decline at midday. Before closing, the price fell to a low of 9,240 yuan, supported by lots 105 and 91, ending at 9,310 yuan. After the close, asking prices decreased slightly, but American Asiatic (美亞), New Light (新光), and China Silk (中絲) remained stable. The results compared to the previous closing price showed slight increases for New Light (新光) and Jingfu (景福), a half-percent increase for American Asiatic (美亞) and New China (新華), slight decreases for Yong Yarn (永紗), Xinyi (信和), Qinxing (勤興), Sino-French (中法), and Yonggong (永公), a half-percent decrease for Huafeng (華豐), and flat prices for Commercial Press (商務), National Goods (國貨), Jinglun (景綸), Cement (水泥), and New Asia (新亞). Lian (麗安) fell 20%, Match (火柴), Tongyi (統益), and China Textile (中紡) fell half a percent, Rongfeng (榮豐), China Textile Five Harmony (中紡五和) slightly decreased, Datong (大通) increased half a percent slightly, and Innerwear (內衣) increased slightly. Forward delivery stocks showed flat prices for Jingfu (景福) and Qinyu (勤與), slight increases for New Light (新光) and American Asiatic (美亞), and about a half-percent decrease for Yong Yarn (永紗), Xinyi (信和), Huafeng (華豐), and Yonggong (永公). In the over-the-counter market, except for Nanyang (南洋), which increased half a percent, the remaining old stocks showed slight increases and decreases.</p>
<h3>Unified Bonds Sluggish; Foreign Stocks Decline</h3>
<p>Public bonds were even more sluggish. Unified Class C opened at 8,400 yuan. Rooms 503 and foreign banks slightly bought, pushing the high price to 8,500 yuan. Room 230 and others liquidated their positions, causing the price to close near the 8,000 yuan mark. The transaction volume was only 2,000,000 yuan, a slight decrease of 100 yuan compared to the previous closing price for Classes A and B, a 200 yuan decrease for Unified Class C, and flat prices for Classes D and E.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks began to decline yesterday. Securities firms and the Northern clique sold off, while foreign merchants and Chen (陳) made purchases. However, with a large amount of Great Kangcheng's (大康成) inventory being released, and a substantial amount of Jardine Silk (怡紗) being offered, the environment returned to normal. The Hong Kong-Shanghai telegraph rose from 11 yuan to 10.02 yuan. Jardine Silk (怡紗) opened at 93,000 yuan and gradually declined to close at 88,000 yuan. The results compared to the previous closing price showed a one-tenth decline for Conder (會德), Ye Guang (業廣), Paper Industry (紙業), and Jardine (怡), slight decreases for Steel Industry (鋼業) and Telephone (電話), and a half-percent decrease for Jardine Silk (怡紗), British American Tobacco (英聯), Shipping Industry (航業), and Seed Industry (製種).</p>
<h3>Tea Market Steady</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the domestic tea market saw purchases of various grades by local shops and Suzhou merchants. For export tea, Wuchang Tea Company (午昌茶葉公司) and foreign firms like Wing On &amp; Co. (永興) and Tung Foong (同孚) showed interest in last year's old tea, resulting in active trading and a generally stable market sentiment. However, the exchange between buying and selling ultimately felt weak, continuing a fluctuating trend. With the year-end settlement approaching for money houses and tight credit conditions, the selling side had difficulty raising prices, resulting in a very stable base price.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to rise by 10,000 to 340,000 yuan, with purchases remaining strong. The Public Association set prices for Peruvian sand sugar at 680,000 yuan, Number 20 medium sand white at 610,000 yuan, Taiwanese red sugar at 550,000 yuan, and Number 3.5 refined white sugar at 670,000 yuan. Few local sugar offerings made for a very tight market. Xinghua (興化) white sugar in bags was priced at 580,000 yuan for high-quality sugar and 540,000 yuan for sugar in baskets. Xinghua (興化) red sugar was priced at 440,000 to 450,000 yuan, totaling about 400 pieces. Shantou (汕提) green sugar initially went for 420,000 yuan, then rose to 426,000 yuan and 430,000 yuan. Cotton red sugar was priced at 500,000 yuan, totaling about one hundred bales. Diaozhi (刁靑) sugar was priced at 385,000 to 390,000 yuan, totaling about one hundred bales.</p>
<h3>Resources Commission Revises Purchase Prices for Tungsten and Antimony</h3>
<p>The Resources Commission has revised the prices for specific minerals as follows: (1) The purchase price for tungsten sand is 5,000,000 yuan per metric ton. (2) The purchase price for raw antimony is calculated at 70% of pure antimony, which is 3,500,000 yuan per metric ton. The purchase price for antimony oxide is calculated at 80% of antimony, which is 4,000,000 yuan per metric ton.</p>
<h3>China Trust Bureau and Kailuan Coal Mines Negotiate Coal Exchange Method; 80,000 Tons of Flour for 100,000 Tons of Coal</h3>
<p>To address the coal shortage in Shanghai, the Central Trust Bureau is not only ordering foreign coal from areas such as Bianluo (邊羅) to be transported to Shanghai for sale, but also plans to negotiate with domestic coal mines to purchase coal for transport to Shanghai. Among domestic coal mines, Kailuan (開灤) coal mine has the highest output this year. However, given the high price of grain, the miners at the Kailuan (開灤) mine have a substantial need for grain. Therefore, the mine is seeking to exchange grain for coal from the Central Trust Bureau. After negotiations between the two parties, the Central Trust Bureau has decided to exchange flour for coal from the mine. The Central Trust Bureau will soon transport 80,000 tons of flour to Kailuan (開灤), and Kailuan (開灤) will transport 100,000 tons of coal to Shanghai, which is expected to resolve the coal shortage in the city.</p>
<p>Fuel Management Committee to Increase Coal Allocation Prices on July 1</p>
<p>The Fuel Management Committee, due to increased transportation costs and mine prices, which have increased costs, will adjust allocation prices again starting July 1. The allocation price for coal to factories and transportation companies, originally adjusted to 457,000 yuan per ton, will now be increased to 540,000 yuan per ton. The central government continues to subsidize coal allocation for public utilities this month, so the coal allocation for public utilities this month will remain at 125,000 yuan per ton. Starting in July, the central government subsidy will be canceled, and the allocation price will be adjusted.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes Surge Then Slightly Retreat</h3>
<p>At the opening of the cigarette market yesterday, the market sentiment was still bullish due to strong demand from all parties. In the afternoon, tight credit conditions caused some selling, leading to a slight decline in market sentiment. By the end of the day, the price of ten-pack "Great Britain" cigarettes fell by 30,000 yuan from the previous day to 7,620,000 yuan, and "Haddow" cigarettes also fell by 100,000 yuan. The "Old Blade" (老刀) and "Five Flowers" (五華) brands were relatively stable, rising by 10,000 to 70,000 yuan. The market sentiment for other fast-selling brands of Chinese-made cigarettes remained solid, but brands that were being distributed experienced a decline.</p>
<h3>Cloth Market's Rising Trend Slightly Halted</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw a slightly subdued buying trend due to the authorities' plans to take strict measures, and all parties were wary. As the end of the month approached and credit conditions tightened, industry participants unanimously sold off at high prices, causing market sentiment to decline. By the end of the day, the prices of all grades of 12-pound fine cloth fell sharply by 5,000 to 15,000 yuan. The markets for bleached cloth, coarse cloth, grey cloth, twill drill, and straight tribute cloth also experienced declines of 5,000 to 20,000 yuan. However, blue cloth, "Shilin" cloth, and "Yuanfu" silk saw price increases of 13,000 to 40,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Spinning Construction Sells Yarn</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] China Spinning Construction Company sold yarn as usual yesterday, selling a total of 331 units, all of which were sold to manufacturers. A total of 262 application forms were received.</p>
<p>Batch of Banknotes Transported from England to Shanghai</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Yitai (怡泰) ship "Glen Affric" transported 160 boxes of banknotes from London, which arrived in Shanghai yesterday and docked at the Blue Funnel Wharf for unloading. Additionally, the "Lancaster Castle" transported 500 tons of paper pulp from Canada, purchased by the Resources Commission. Also, 500 tons of white paper.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Red Dates Gradually Increase</h3>
<p>The price of Tianjin red dates has been gradually increasing recently, and the market rose by approximately 10% yesterday. High-quality red dates were priced at 1,000,000 yuan, and secondary-quality red dates were priced at 900,000 to 800,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>New People, New Policies</h3>
<p>— Taiwan's Solutions to Unemployment</p>
<p>Taipei, 23rd (Airmail) Special Correspondent Jiang Yun (江雲) of This Newspaper</p>
<p>The February 28 Incident (二二八) provided Taiwan's rulers with new factual lessons: to seek stability from afar, and to pursue progress and prosperity in stability. The biggest focus in stability is on unemployment relief.</p>
<p>Taiwanese compatriots often cite the Japanese occupation as a source of dissatisfaction, and the employment problem is a common point of attack used by those from other provinces. However, it is difficult to obtain an accurate number of unemployed people on the island of Taiwan. Those who are disappointed are used to being intimidated during the Japanese rule, and they avoid cooperation or deliberately evade surveys, fearing disclosure of their employment status, resulting in inaction. The provincial assembly has proposals to solve unemployment, but lacks statistical reports. The figures provided by local governments at all levels are also not entirely accurate, forcing the Department of Civil Affairs (民政廳) to conduct a re-survey. In fact, of the 120,000 Taiwanese who have returned to the province from overseas and other parts of China, most had no previous occupation. At least half of them need employment, plus the true number of unemployed skilled workers in various sectors, it is estimated that there are about 60,000 to 80,000 unemployed people. Most of these are young people who could not find a foothold outside the province and returned full of enthusiasm in the year after the peace.</p>
<p>These unemployed people cannot withstand the high pressure of prices. Although they have requested the government to provide employment as soon as possible, the government cannot easily arrange jobs for them, resulting in disruptions to public order and social unrest. Currently, the authorities are following a path to resolve the issue. This is a new beginning with new policies, and people have high hopes.</p>
<p>Public Land Leasing Can Accommodate 140,000 People</p>
<p>Zhu Foding (朱佛定), Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, has provided a concrete and practical plan that will be submitted to the provincial government for approval and implementation. The main aspect is the leasing of public land (limited to farmland), including: (1) 20,000 chia (甲) (equivalent to 280,000 mu 畝) of self-operated farmland allocated by the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, with one chia per household and six people per household, can accommodate 20,000 households, 120,000 people. (2) Nineteen airfields requisitioned by the Japanese have been designated for civilian use and can accommodate 7,000 people. (3) Other lands owned by companies and agencies such as pineapple farms and the Hekoto (合拓) company may be allocated for leasing and resettlement of farm laborers, which can accommodate 2,331 households, or 13,986 people. The total number of people accommodated is 140,000.</p>
<p>The budget that the government has decided to provide is 800 million yuan for equipment and operating expenses (including housing, farm tools, and living expenses of 314,284 yuan per household). This budget does not affect the provincial budget but is drawn from the rental income from the consolidation of public lands.</p>
<p>Immigration and Land Reclamation Require 120,000 People</p>
<p>Land reclamation is a difficult task. While solving the unemployment problem, it also increases production and disperses the excess population in the cities. Taiwan Province has 130,000 chia (甲) (equivalent to 2,600,000 mu 畝) of reclaimable land, including grasslands, barren mountains, sandy lands, and saline-alkali lands. According to surveys, 24,000 chia (甲) can be leased this year, and surveys are planned to be completed within four years, which can accommodate over 200,000 households, or 122,500 people.</p>
<p>Land reclamation is not about "grabbing sandy fields." It requires planning, encouragement, and protection, and must be seen as a key aspect of governance. For this reason, the government needs a large budget to build public dormitories, supply farm tools, provide production equipment, and cover operating expenses, estimated to cost NT$2,177,223,000.</p>
<p>The source of funding is the rental income from public lands in the 35th year of the Republic, income from the suppression of illegal cultivation, income increased after consolidating land titles, allocations from cooperative farms and the sale of Japanese assets, and loans from the Land Bank.</p>
<p>The land reclamation period is set at three years, with a five-year exemption from land taxes. There will be a specialized management agency, and a land reclamation office will be established under the county government to be responsible for guidance and supervision.</p>
<p>Even now, the Japanese have not forgotten their "special" right to "immigrate" to Taiwan. We must make good use of and operate the former Japanese immigrant villages.</p>
<p>Large Engineering Team is a First in China</p>
<p>When Chen Yi (陳儀) left Taiwan, he left Chairman Wei (魏) with an unfinished task: to resettle unemployed workers and form an engineering team of tens of thousands of people to engage in large-scale construction. This unemployment relief plan is based on the "Splending Policy" that people criticized Roosevelt for, which is to launch large-scale public works projects to relieve a large number of unemployed skilled workers. This plan was proposed by Fei 費, the former director of the Public Works Bureau. Director Chen Yi was prepared to implement it, but the reorganization of the provincial government caused him to hand it over to his successor.</p>
<p>Yang Jiayu (楊家瑜), the director of the Department of Construction, is also deeply concerned about this employment problem. He hopes that General Manager Wu Wenxi (吳文喜) of the Engineering Company can provide a concrete implementation plan. General Manager Wu firmly opposes the management of a large-scale engineering team by the military. He advocates adopting a contracting system at centralized construction sites and a subcontracting system in some construction areas. He hopes to implement this groundbreaking relief plan without wasting money and does not want there to be more workers than engineers or for the government to pay more than the workers benefit.</p>
<p>Currently, the Engineering Company is launching a warehouse project to store 400,000 tons of sugarcane production this year. This warehouse project is widespread throughout the province, urgently needed, and of great quantity, scheduled for completion by the end of the year. The direct workers required are approximately 1,625,000 people, of which technical workers account for approximately 70%, or 9,500 people, and ordinary workers account for approximately 30%, or 4,000 people. The indirect workers required are approximately 148,000 people, of which technical workers account for only 1,500 people, and ordinary workers account for 8,600 people. In total, the project requires approximately 11,000 technical workers and 12,060 ordinary workers. For the scattered warehouse projects throughout the province, a subcontracting system will still be used to ensure the progress of the project itself and to relieve unemployed workers. The Warehouse Project Committee will coordinate the number of unemployed workers and their skills in each county and city and allocate them to contractors for employment, reasonably assessing their wages. Capable unemployed workers will be recruited by contractors as basic workers, so that they do not lose their jobs again after the work is completed.</p>
<p>The formation of a large engineering team is a first in China, and the centralized management and funding of these unemployed workers in Taiwan are issues that deserve consideration.</p>
<p>The Unemployed Have the Power to Stabilize Society</p>
<p>Being a Taiwanese compatriot is a blessing, a blessing bestowed by the eight-year War of Resistance. In the interior of China, where there are fires everywhere and insecurity everywhere, it is difficult to survive, let alone build. However, here, we are actively engaged in reconstruction. The people have requests, and the government always tries to solve them. The government always hopes that the people will understand things that it cannot do.</p>
<p>Solving the unemployment problem is a trial that the Taiwanese unemployed are giving to the new provincial government. We should not regard it as merely a theoretical matter but as a giant task requiring strong perseverance. The authorities need to take the matter seriously, and the people must participate enthusiastically. In particular, the unemployed themselves need to understand that they have the decisive power to stabilize social order.</p>
<p>The realization of the Principle of People's Livelihood is not just a resounding slogan but a pragmatic countermeasure aimed at reality and put into practice.</p>

<h3>Today's Postal Service</h3>
<p>— Tang Xichun (湯錫椿)</p>
<p>China's postal service has always adopted a "self-supporting" policy, meaning that postal revenue covers postal expenses. Before the war, prices were stable, and the postal service was able to be self-sufficient. Since the War of Resistance, prices have soared, and transportation costs and operating expenses have increased sharply along with prices. However, postal rates have not kept pace with inflation, leading to increasing financial losses for the postal service. It is estimated that the losses were 45 million yuan in the 30th year of the Republic (1941), 145 million yuan in the 31st year (1942), 72 million yuan in the 32nd year (1943), 715 million yuan in the 33rd year (1944), 74.88 billion yuan in the 34th year (1945), and 862.9 billion yuan in the 35th year (1946). The estimated losses from January to May of this year are approximately 90 billion yuan. Although the government provides some subsidies, the monthly losses are still alarming. The causes of the losses can be analyzed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Soaring Prices and Rapidly Increasing Expenses: Postal revenue is restricted by postal rates, which cannot be increased in a timely manner. However, postal expenses increase at any time along with the surging prices, such as postal transportation costs, business equipment costs, and all administrative expenses. For example, the current postal rate for a regular letter is 100 yuan, while the printing cost of each stamp is already 38 yuan. If a regular letter requires two stamps, the cost of the stamps alone is 76 yuan. If the letter is mailed at a postal agency, the agency fee must also be deducted. The remaining amount is definitely not enough to cover the transportation and delivery costs of a letter. Another example is the mailing of newspapers, where only 10 yuan is charged per bundle. The printing cost of one stamp is 38 yuan. If newspapers are delivered free of charge without stamps, the cost would be 28 yuan less. It is estimated that the post office loses more than 4 billion yuan per month on the delivery of newspapers alone. The losses are even greater for the delivery of other printed matter and books.</p>
<p>(2) Postal Rates Too Low and Rate Increases Too Late: Currently, general prices have increased more than 20,000 times compared to before the war. Postal rates, calculated by comparing a regular letter for 5 fen (cents) before the war with 100 yuan for a regular letter today, have only increased 2,000 times. The increase is not proportional to the increase in prices, and the timing of rate increases lags far behind inflation. For example, the rate for a regular letter increased from 2 yuan to 20 yuan on October 1 of the 34th year (1945), and then increased to 100 yuan on November 1 of last year, remaining unchanged until today. However, prices are changing rapidly. With a revenue of 2,000 times the previous amount, bearing expenses of more than 20,000 times, losses are inevitable.</p>
<p>(3) Decline in Parcel Business and Increase in Letter Volume: Before the war, transportation was smooth, and commerce was developed. The postal service received and delivered more than 9 million parcels per year. Therefore, parcel revenue was a major source of postal income. Now, however, domestic warfare continues, and transportation is disrupted. The parcel business cannot be developed. In the 35th year (1946), only 740,000 parcels were received and delivered, which is one-thirteenth of the pre-war volume. The business has plummeted. However, letter volume is increasing day by day due to low postal rates, especially registered and express letters. In the 25th year of the Republic (1936), the average monthly volume of letters received and delivered was 73,473,000. In March of this year, it has increased to 94,046,000. Because postal rates are low and do not cover costs, the more letters are received and delivered, the greater the losses.</p>
<p>The reasons why the postal service's finances cannot be sustained are roughly as described above. How to compensate for the losses is a matter of urgent importance. If the government operates the postal service for the purpose of facilitating the people, it should not calculate costs. All postal losses should be subsidized by the government to achieve the goals of "stability," "speed," and "comfort." If the postal service is operated according to the "self-supporting" policy, then the setting of postal rates should at least barely cover costs, so that this public service agency can continue to maintain and improve its operations. Which path to choose should be a clear decision for the authorities, and they should not waver between the two. If subsidies are not sufficient and rate increases are not enough, it will create the current situation of being neither dead nor alive.</p>
<p>In the past, postal rights were in the hands of foreigners. Personnel administration and financial control were completely independent. After the Northern Expedition, although the postal service was formally incorporated into the transportation administrative system, the authorities have consistently adopted the "self-supporting" policy for the postal service. The postal service is entirely responsible for solving its own revenue and expenditure issues. When there is a surplus, the excess funds are used to improve operations. When there is a loss, the passive solution is to strive to tighten finances, reduce staff, and cut expenses to reduce expenditures. The active solution is to increase postal rates to compensate for the losses. Or both passive and active solutions are used. In short, one's own difficulties are solved by oneself, without relying on the government. Personnel administration is also a separate system, not allowing anyone who has not passed the examination to enter the service, and not allowing anyone who has violated the law or committed fraud to remain in the service. The glorious history of the postal service in the past was entirely built on the policy of economic independence and independent personnel administration. However, since the War of Resistance, due to the drastic changes in prices and the various restrictions on postal rate increases, the postal service's finances cannot be controlled independently, leading to a difficult and desperate situation. Under these circumstances, the postal service is still striving to improve. Recently, there have been demonstration post offices, all-night post offices, and mobile post offices in Nanjing and Shanghai. At the same time, ordinary mail is being transported by air as much as possible, and mobile post offices are being added to trains. Local mail is delivered on the same day. All of these are providing great convenience to the people, whether they are improving service or expediting delivery.</p>
<p>Since China's victory, the political issues have not been resolved reasonably, and everything is in disarray. Among the state-owned enterprises today, the postal service is probably the only one that can be praised. However, the postal service is now struggling in a very difficult economic situation. Although it relies on the continuous promotion of the excellent personnel system and spirit, it can barely manage to improve. However, even a skilled woman cannot cook without rice, and labor cannot be sustained for long. The postal service is an essential institution for serving the people. We cannot do without the postal service for even one day. We cannot sit idly by in the face of the current economic crisis facing the postal service. We hope that the government will quickly devise effective remedies to maintain its service functions and enable this business with 50 years of glorious history to continue to create a more brilliant future.</p>
<h3>Singing for the Fresh Troops of the Air Force - A Record of the Anniversary Celebration of the Re-establishment of Jianqiao Military Academy</h3>
<p>— Hangzhou, 25th (Fast News) - Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng of this Newspaper</p>
<p>The cradle of the Chinese Air Force - Jianqiao Air Force Officer School, held its anniversary celebration of its re-establishment, together with the graduation ceremony of the 24th class students. It was a solemn and lively scene, leaving everyone with unparalleled joy.</p>
<p>The 24th class students joined the most heroic and glorious aerial combat against the enemy during the most difficult stage of our War of Resistance. They responded to the call for educated youths to join the army and enlisted in Kunming successively in December of the 33rd year of the Republic of China. The examinations were particularly strict, and it was not until January of the 34th year of the Republic of China that they completed the work that new recruits should be responsible for before entering the school for rigorous training. Among them, there was also an examination to go to India. At that time, nearly 400 people participated in the examination, including those from Chengdu West China University and Wangjianglou Sichuan University, etc., and their number exceeded one-half. On April 14th, they completed the will that every air force officer must make in advance. In May, they flew over the Hump to Tingjiang, Bengal, India, and then took a train westward to Lahore, Punjab, the cultural center of India. In the lower sentence of this month, they began flight and ground education. After two full months of the first stage of preliminary training, except for a part that was eliminated due to physical changes or lagging in flight progress, each student of the 24th class was able to independently drive a "Stearman" training aircraft, soaring in the sky of a foreign country, freely circling up and down.</p>
<p>Returning Home After Completing Studies</p>
<p>After completing the first stage of study, they began to be sent to the United States in batches to receive joint training for the replenishment of Allied Air Force personnel. Nearly 300 people went to the United States. At this time, because Japan surrendered unconditionally after August, 25 students of the 24th class who were going to the United States were stopped.</p>
<p>The 24th class students who went to the United States took a boat from Lahore to Calcutta, through the Suez Canal, out of the Strait of Gibraltar, and landed in New York, the most prosperous city in the United States. They first enlisted at Genter Field, then studied elementary flying at Good Fellow Field, intermediate flying at Landorlff Field, and advanced flying at William Field. They had already completed their studies in June of this year and began to return to China one after another, totaling more than 200 people.</p>
<p>First Batch of Self-Trained</p>
<p>The 25 students of the 24th class who stayed in Lahore followed the school headquarters back to Hangzhou. During the year of the school's re-establishment, they completed their studies through intermediate and advanced training. This was the first batch of graduates in China to resume self-training after the victory. Among the 25 of them, 21 completed their studies, confirming that China has the ability to establish its own national defense cadres. General Mao Bangchu, Deputy Commander of the Chinese Air Force, who was in charge of supervising the education of students sent to the United States, said: "The 24th class students in the school and the 24th class students who went to the United States completed their studies at the same time. Although there is a distinction between domestic and foreign in terms of region, the supervisors and instructors at all levels who are in charge of elementary and advanced flight education in this school are mostly those who have returned to China after studying or training in the United States, so the education methods, techniques, and other aspects of attainments are completely the same, and there is no difference."</p>
<p>Elimination Rate</p>
<p>Among the nearly 400 people who entered the school, the total number of students who have graduated inside and outside the group is now more than 200, and the elimination rate accounts for more than 35%.</p>
<p>Among the 21 graduates in China, the first place was Liang Yansheng, with a total score of 87 points, and he also won the first place in flying. Nearly 100 of them were eliminated, and most of these 100 people were due to the reduction in physical fitness and flight energy. However, in the 24th class, such an elimination rate is already very low. Currently, there are still the 25th and 26th classes receiving training in the school, and the 27th class has also begun to enroll.</p>
<p>The graduates of the 24th class will be assigned to the troops for probation. At present, the air transport work is also urgently needed, and a part will be selected to serve in the Air Force transport unit. After a short period of probation, they will take on the task of air transport in the long sky of the motherland. As for serving as instructors in the school, that will be a very small number, and they will also need to receive specialized training as instructors.</p>
<p>Fresh Troops</p>
<p>Hu Weike, the director of education at the Air Force Officer School, was extremely excited to see that so many fresh troops had been added to the current Air Force. After the grand graduation ceremony, he personally drove a plane to perform spectacular stunts to show his joy. General Liu Muqun, commander of the Air Force Training Command, also happily told reporters: "The quality of the 24th class students is excellent. These many fresh troops participating in the Chinese Air Force will be a huge force."</p>
<p>On this day of the first anniversary of the re-establishment of the school and the 24th class graduation ceremony, all officers and students of the school and guests participated in the grand and solemn ceremony, followed by watching a friendly basketball game between the air forces of Shanghai and Hangzhou, and then the 24th class graduates performed an aerial review. It was a huge group of planes, forming a strong aerial great wall, proudly flying in the vast space. They are giant eagles capable of self-defense, spreading their iron wings and relentlessly monitoring the rampant foxes and rabbits. The people on the ground were fascinated by this soaring and heroic aerial procession, and everyone looked up and watched with joy.</p>
<p>On that day, the Air Force School had three banquets: lunch was a potluck, the afternoon was a cocktail party, and the evening was another potluck. At 8:00 p.m., a solo concert by Ms. Jiang Ying was held. Her melodious voice unfolded, just to sing praises for the addition of fresh troops to the motherland's air force.</p>

<p>Primary School Students Care About Construction</p>
<p>Wujin Yutang Town is located on the south bank of the Yangtze River. Historically, the government's promotion of government orders and all construction has been lagging behind. The opinions that I want to disclose are as follows: This town is not developed in terms of commerce because of the inconvenience of water and land transportation. The waterway (Zao Port River) is unsuitable for navigation due to years of disrepair and siltation. According to the elders of this town, it was dredged once in the 19th year of the Republic of China, and has not been dredged since. In August last year, the Construction Department sent personnel to survey the river. The town office immediately sent a letter requesting assistance from the Relief Administration to dredge the river, but it has not been realized. The land route (Longxu) highway was forcibly built by the people during the enemy's occupation and was completed hastily. Public buses used to run on it last year, but they were stopped due to frequent dangers on the road surface and bridges. Therefore, when this town has important matters to contact the county government or the district office, it can only send people on foot. I hope that the government will improve the Yongli transportation in this town, quickly dredge the river and restore the highway to traffic, and at the same time set up rural telephones.

<p>The Xinjiang Incident Ignites Anger</p>
<p>The Foreign Mongolian army illegally invaded my Xinjiang Baitashan. In addition to the government authorities having issued a solemn statement, the people of the whole country are indignant. This column, according to letters from readers Sun Deliang, Li Xiyang, and other gentlemen, is limited in scope and excerpts its main points as follows:</p>
<p>Foreign Mongolia originally belonged to my country's territory. After the victory, the government, in order to follow the Prime Minister's last wishes to support ethnic autonomy, allowed it to be independent, but instead repaid kindness with hatred and invaded my territory. This is intolerable. All of our people should urge the government to take effective measures based on the position of territorial integrity, and never make any concessions. On the one hand, we appeal to the armed communists to abandon party disputes, unite sincerely, as in the period of resistance against Japan, and concentrate their efforts to resist foreign aggression. On the other hand, everyone should stick to their posts, bury their heads in construction, and consolidate national defense. When it comes to the survival of the nation, everyone should raise their vigilance, etc.</p>
<h3>An Unprecedented Catastrophe in Thirty Years - Flooding in the Four Rivers of Guangdong</h3>
<p>— Guangzhou, 20th (Air News) - Special Correspondent Liang Feng of this Newspaper</p>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, torrential rains have been pouring down day and night in various parts of Guangdong Province, without a single sunny day from late May to late June. As a result of such continuous rain for more than a month, the East, West, North, and Han rivers in the province have experienced flash floods, like thousands of horses galloping, pouring out and causing flooding and widespread suffering. In addition to the thirty counties in the four river basins, even the counties in southern Guangdong and Qiongya have recently suffered serious flooding, so the scope of the current flood disaster has actually spread throughout Guangdong Province. This is the only situation seen since the so-called "Yimao Flood" in the 4th year of the Republic of China, and it can be said to be an unprecedented catastrophe in Guangdong in the past thirty years!</p>
<p>Irresistible Natural Disaster</p>
<p>Guangdong is a coastal province with low-lying terrain. The four rivers of East, West, North, and Han all pass through the province and out to sea. Every summer, due to the large amount of rainfall, the river water level will inevitably rise, so the residents along the river have built dikes to prevent flooding. This is like building fortifications. From the upper reaches of the river, dikes are built one after another as defense lines to resist the enemy of floods. However, sometimes there is too much rain. The flood cannot be discharged in time, the water level rises, and the water flow becomes faster, so the defense lines on both sides are easily broken by the flood, causing flooding. The "Yimao Flood" in Guangdong in the 4th year of the Republic of China was because the dikes along the northwest rivers were all destroyed at that time, and even the most solid defense line guarding Guangzhou - the Shijiao Garden between Qingyuan and Sanshui - was breached, causing two-thirds of the area in Guangzhou City to become a swamp, with water reaching the doorposts. The number of displaced victims throughout the province reached millions, and the severity of the disaster can be imagined. Although this reporter has never personally witnessed the situation at that time, I once heard my family members mention it when I was a child, and the terrifying impression is still very deep. Who would have thought that today, thirty years later, just after the end of the restoration period and the beginning of reconstruction, when the people are still struggling, this irresistible natural disaster has descended, causing an unprecedented tragedy in thirty years, how can people not sigh to the sky!</p>
<p>The East River Flood Area is the Widest</p>
<p>The disaster area in the province is now the widest in the area flooded by the East River, while the intensity of the water and the depth of the flooding are the greatest in the Northwest River. Let's talk about the East River first: the flooded area includes Longchuan, Heyuan, Zijin, Huiyang, Boluo, Zengcheng, Dongguan, Huaxian and other counties. The famous dikes along the river, such as Yanwo, Fulong, Xihu, Taiping, Hanxi Sluice, Guanghe, Zhizhou, Puwei, Wuxiang, Liyuzhou, and the newly built Ma'anwei, were all destroyed one after another, causing Heyuan, Zijin, Huiyang, etc. to be generally flooded throughout the counties. Among them, the disaster in Huiyang is particularly serious, and the water level is three feet higher than Ma'anwei, so the fields and houses are all covered by water, and the families and livestock are naturally gone. The number of victims gathering on the mountains to avoid the disaster reached more than 200,000. The houses in Heyuan County were also completely submerged, and 300 to 400 houses were washed away, and more than 100 people drowned. In the Shilong area of Dongguan, there is a vast expanse of water for hundreds of miles. The entire city of Boluo is in the water, and the villages near Guangjiu Road in Zengcheng have been completely submerged, with more than a thousand houses collapsing, and the number of villagers who drowned is even impossible to investigate. In the Han River basin, which is also in eastern Guangdong, the affected areas include Chenghai, Chaoan, Chaoyang, Raoping, and even Wuhua, Meixian, and Xingning counties, among which the disasters in Jianan and Chenghai are relatively serious.</p>
<p>The Tragedy of the West and North Rivers</p>
<p>As for the West and North Rivers, the disaster situation may not be as tragic as that of the East River, but the losses and serious situations may be even greater; because the floods in Guangdong in previous years have been the most violent in the west. The West River enters the country from Wuzhou in Guangxi, and the water flows down from high to low at the fastest speed. Moreover, it merges with the North River in the southwest town of Sanshui, and then flows out to sea through the Pearl River Delta in Nanhai, Xinhui and other counties; therefore, the area below Sanshui is commonly known as the Northwest River. There, because the two rivers compete for flow, the water势 is even more fierce. The Pearl River Delta area is all a rich area, the land is fertile, and the crops are very abundant, so the losses from the flood are also very large. Now, the county seat of Qingyuan in the North River basin has been completely submerged, and the water depth is more than ten feet in the lower-lying areas; SiHui, Conghua and other counties also have many floods, and the situation in the West River is even more serious; Yunan, Deqing, Ducheng, Yuecheng and other places are at the forefront of the West River's entry into the country, and the dikes along the coast have been breached; the county towns have been submerged for a long time, and thousands of houses have been submerged, and the victims have been displaced, and they have no food or shelter, and the situation is unbearable to witness. Further down the West River, the Bu Dayuan, Liantang, Gongxin, Yong'an, Huilong, and Fengle Gardens in Gao Yao have also collapsed one after another; the Xinjiang Dayuan, which has not yet been completed, has been broken again, and the nearby 30 villages and tens of thousands of acres of good farmland have been completely submerged. The Yaoming Thirteen Gardens, which are known as the Guangdong demonstration country, are now in danger. Among them, the Dasha Garden has been breached, and 20,000 acres of farmland have been submerged. If the breach collapses again, Gaoyao and Gaoming counties may be completely submerged. Zhaoqing, an important town in the upper reaches of the West River, has long been sailing on the road, and the water is over the knees even in the highest areas of the city; business has almost completely stopped, and the power plant has been unable to start due to flooding, and the entire city has become a dark world!</p>
<p>Guangzhou is Fortunate Not to Have Suffered a Major Disaster</p>
<p>As for the situation in Guangzhou, because the water level has not reached the "Yimao" record after all, it has not caused a major disaster; however, the low-lying areas in the city have long been invaded by floods; now the streets on the Xiguan Dongdi Henan Yibang have been completely flooded, and the water depth ranges from one foot to five feet; and the areas of Zhutang, Nan'an, Fangcun, Huangsha, etc. have become a vast expanse of water, completely becoming swamps. Residents have been taking small boats to temporarily take refuge in higher places, and many more are carrying their sons and daughters because their houses have been flooded, and they are sleeping on the streets, and the situation is very embarrassing. Especially on the 18th and 19th, because it was rumored that Shijiao Dike had collapsed, everyone was anticipating the tragedy of the "Yimao" flood, and they were even more panicked, thinking that a great disaster was about to come, and they really could not eat or sleep; the security authorities also regularly sent police to patrol all night, reporting the changes in the water situation at any time, so that citizens could prepare to escape. Although it was confirmed on the 20th that Shijiao Dike had not collapsed, the water level in the city still rose without receding, and the citizens' anxiety had not diminished. Moreover, due to the floods in various places, the transportation outside the city was almost completely cut off. The Guangzhou-Hankou Railway, Guangwu, Guangsan and other lines could not be opened due to the road surface being submerged; the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway was also suspended for a time, but it has now been restored. The bridges and culverts on the highway have been mostly washed away, and the losses are more than 3 billion yuan, so the highway vehicles in the province have almost completely stopped; the river ferries have also been afraid to sail due to the tight water flow; as a result, all commercial sectors have been greatly affected; and various daily necessities have been in short supply, further triggering vicious price increases; the price of rice has risen by more than 100,000 yuan in one day, with a record of up to 330,000 yuan per dan, and other prices have also doubled in a few days; so although citizens have not directly suffered the harm of the flood, the threat of rising prices is enough to make citizens cry out in pain!</p>
<p>Relief Efforts are Urgently Needed</p>
<p>Amidst the cries of the victims in the border areas, relief is of course the most urgent task at present. Therefore, the party, government, and military authorities, as well as people from all walks of life, have been extremely busy planning and running around for flood relief efforts. The organs have allocated considerable amounts of rice and funds for relief: the Relief Administration has allocated 1,200 tons of rice, and the Siamese Overseas Chinese Donation Rice Committee has allocated 350 tons; the provincial government has also allocated 100 million yuan in relief funds allocated to the counties in May for flood relief, and has also allocated 2,000 dan of rented grain from the Huiji Yicang, and overseas Chinese donations from New York have entrusted the purchase of 254 bags of Siamese rice, and have launched a campaign for all provincial and municipal civil servants to donate one day's salary. At the same time, the "Guangdong Provincial Flood Emergency Relief Committee" organized by the Xingyuan, provincial and municipal governments, provincial and municipal councils, the Grain Relief Association, the Reporters Association, and other agencies and organizations was formally established on the 16th. The committee has telegraphed the Executive Yuan for emergency relief funds of 10 billion yuan, and has consulted with the Four Joint Branches to advance a loan of 5 billion yuan for emergency relief, and has launched a campaign for donations from all walks of life. This relief movement is indeed developing vigorously, but as of the time of this reporter's dispatch, the water situation is still rising without receding, proving that the disaster situation is really unknown, and the current strength of this province may have been exhausted. According to the Relief Administration, it is said that there is no grain left, so we still need to make an urgent appeal for help and relief from all parts of the country!</p>

<h3>"Rousseau" Fan (Crosstalk Play)</h3>
<p>— Jiang Song</p>
<p>Written for the Rousseau Birthday Commemoration</p>
<p>[Mr. B sits upright on a chair, flipping through a biography of Rousseau, lost in thought; Mr. A enters, holding a stalk of sweet sorghum]</p>
<p>A: Look, I bought a stalk of sorghum today.</p>
<p>B: Yes! Today is Rousseau's birthday, Jean Jacques Rousseau. A: What "how many votes"?</p>
<p>B: Rousseau is a great man, a great French educator of the 18th century, today is his birthday.</p>
<p>A: I thought it was the birthday of some tycoon, what's the big deal about an educator, how much is he worth a pound, it cost me two thousand yuan to buy this stalk of sorghum.</p>
<p>B: I don't allow you to say that, he is the person I admire the most, the greatest person in the world, you can't insult him!</p>
<p>A: Look at how serious you are, I don't want to argue with you, I'm going to call Lao Wang...one seven one two zero.</p>
<p>B: One seven one two is the year Rousseau was born, he was born in Geneva, Switzerland. A: Oh, no, I remembered wrong, it's one seven six two zero.</p>
<p>B: One seven six two is the year Rousseau published "Emile".</p>
<p>A: I want to invite him to see a movie.</p>
<p>B: There were no movies back then, movies were invented in 1893.</p>
<p>A: What are you talking about? I'm talking about inviting Lao Wang to see a movie, Lao Wang is my good friend.</p>
<p>B: Rousseau had a good friend - Mrs. Warens, this person gave him a lot of help when he was down and out. A: You're crazy, how can you bring up Rousseau no matter what, I'm talking about inviting my friend Lao Wang to see a movie, and then go to the jazz bar for a cup of coffee, there are waitresses there, hey: waitress!</p>
<p>B: That's right, Rousseau had a lover, a waitress named Tcersele.</p>
<p>A: Really? This guy is quite lucky, the French waitresses must be very flirtatious.</p>
<p>B: Some people translate Rousseau's name as Lu Sao, which is really not elegant.</p>
<p>A: My God! You're always talking about sorghum, sorghum, I'm so tired of you.</p>
<p>B: Rousseau was not long or short, five feet seven and a half inches tall, one hundred and thirty-eight pounds, brown hair, fair face, nose slightly crooked.</p>
<p>A: There's really no way, okay, I admit you're ruthless, can we talk about something else serious?</p>
<p>B: Okay! Let me ask you, "After the progress of science and art, is it beneficial or harmful to human morality?"</p>
<p>A: I don't know, probably, probably harmful?</p>
<p>B: Right! You agree with Rousseau.</p>
<p>A: What?</p>
<p>B: This was the topic of the essay contest of the French Mao Rong Society in 1749, Rousseau's article was selected first, and he became famous in Paris, a great success!</p>
<p>A: Then why haven't I become famous? Alas. Humans are really unequal</p>
<p>B: Then have you studied "The Causes of Inequality Among Men"?</p>
<p>A: Forget it! You've already confused me, why are you still asking?</p>
<p>B: This was the second essay topic of the Mao Rong Society, but this time Rousseau failed to be selected.</p>

<p>B: What, you want to eat Rousseau?</p>
<p>A: Nonsense! I'm referring to sorghum, not your Rousseau. ...Alas, to be honest, what will people like me who have no education do after graduation? Sometimes I get scared when I think about it.</p>
<p>B: Who told you not to study hard on weekdays, just watch plays, dance, and mess around, I advise you to repent quickly, and write a "Confessions" like Rousseau.</p>
<p>A: Someone introduced me to be a tutor, do you think I can do it?</p>
<p>B: Very good, Rousseau also worked as a tutor for a year.</p>
<p>A: I'm not very willing to do it, it's not bad for Lao Wang to study politics and get an official position after graduation.</p>
<p>B: Since he studies politics, he must have read Rousseau's "Social Contract", ask him what he thinks of this book.</p>
<p>A: But he has now transferred to the Conservatory of Music, and he will still be unemployed after graduation.</p>
<p>B: Then he can be a musician, this is very glorious, a profession that Rousseau did</p>
<p>A: What profession do you think best suits your ideals?</p>
<p>B: Sculptor, secretary, lawyer, surveyor. ...</p>
<p>A: These are all professions that Rousseau did?</p>
<p>B: Yes!</p>

<h3>Arrow</h3>
<p>— Zhongzhi</p>
<p>With a "hiss" sound, a golden arrow flew towards me, and I couldn't avoid it, and it shot into my heart.</p>
<p>With a wounded heart, I went to find someone to heal me. I searched all the magicians and found all the doctors, but no one could heal my wounded heart.</p>
<p>With a wounded heart, I searched through ancient books and searched through literature, but I couldn't find a plan to heal my wounded heart.</p>
<p>So, I went to find the archer, she said: "It's too late."</p>
<p>"Too late"? Is it so understated?</p>
<p>Enduring the infinite pain and suffering, I resolutely pulled out the golden arrow and simply dragged it aside.</p>
<p>It's really too late!</p>
<p>Only volume after volume of classics can repair this heart that has been shot by an arrow.</p>
<p>The arrow of time has taken away the launching ability of the arrow of love!</p>
<p>Now it's really too late.</p>
<h3>Three Chapters on Flower Street</h3>
<p>— Li Baifeng</p>
<p>Flower Street</p>
<p>Walking through the small street filled with potted flowers, I can't help but stop the car every time, examining each and every one of them in front of the stalls.</p>
<p>So many ordinary flowers and vulgar willows! They deliberately put on a graceful posture, sometimes even blooming with ugly-colored flowers; they also pride themselves on being unique, boasting about their vulgar colors among their peers.</p>
<p>Orchids have long withered, and plum blossoms have aged beyond winter; and the pine trees? They are also placed among the weeds, their sturdy bodies bent "as if bowing" due to the passage of time—I know that although flowers and plants are minor pursuits, they must strive to please the common and serve the world in order to survive.</p>
<p>What is most disgusting is the peony, which solemnly takes the posture of a 'court official,' proudly standing among the flowers; in fact, the peony does not excel in color, fragrance, or demeanor; it is valued only because of its large flowers and fat leaves—seeing it, I can't help but think of what is said in physiognomy books: a wealthy appearance with a fat head and big ears.</p>
<p>The seasons for chrysanthemums and cassia branches are still far away, and what about the lotus flower, which emerges from the mud without being stained? Presumably, in this 'world of universal turbidity,' it dwells alone in purity, distinguishing itself in the wilderness? Otherwise, how come not even a single pot of lotus flowers can be seen on this flower street? —Is it 'only after having a Bole that there is a Qianli horse'? Then, in this world without Zhou Maoshu, it is only appropriate that there are no lotus flowers.</p>
<p>Even if it is 'indulging in playthings and losing one's ambition'? Now, there is not even a chance to think about losing one's ambition; this street, filled with ordinary flowers and vulgar willows, merely displays a lot of flowers and plants, but instead makes one feel that a solitary pine tree on a cliff and a clump of chrysanthemums by a bamboo fence are more precious.</p>
<p>Good flowers are not non-existent, but they are not in the noisy urban areas. I think of Yu Zishan's "Small Garden Rhapsody": "The swallow resides to avoid the wind, fundamentally without sentiment for comparison." Perhaps there are still too many Zhan Qins in the world, thinking of counting cranes with luxurious carriages!</p>
<p>People who release cranes are rarely seen once in a hundred generations, and those who cook cranes and burn zithers may have become many dog butchers. This world has no place for good flowers and grasses to live; if there are any, they will be like smelly cabbages and rotten bean sprouts, considering themselves pure and deceiving themselves with high standards?</p>
<p>Star Clusters</p>
<p>Star clusters twinkle in the night sky, boasting to the earth with rare wisdom.</p>
<p>The star clusters gaze at the earth, they see high mountains, they see the sea, but they do not see the human crowds—</p>
<p>Not that they cannot see, but that they disdain to look at this base and filthy humanity. Although humans reside on Earth, just as the star clusters reside in the sky, the stars are messengers of peace, and they get along peacefully, while human interactions involve wars and conflicts.</p>
<p>Although the sky also has unpredictable winds and clouds, these are unrelated to the peace-loving star clusters, and no matter how treacherous the winds and clouds are, they will eventually dissipate and reappear as the sky. In the end, the peaceful night sky will still belong to the tranquil star clusters.</p>
<p>The star clusters are a symbol of the sky's wisdom. During the day, the scorching sun obscures the sky with its mighty flame, but at night? It uses the star clusters to show the existence of its wisdom…</p>
<p>Instead of setting their sights on high mountains and flowing waters, humans should set their sights on the star clusters in the night sky; because the stars love peace, they teach humans to ponder and imagine deeply—</p>
<h3>English - A Verse by Byron Made to Fit a Musical Score</h3>
<p>— Sincerely Translated by Zhenqin</p>
<p>None of the daughters of "Beauty" can be as magical as you are;</p>
<p>And your sweet voice is to me like music floating on the water;</p>
<p>At this moment, that voice seems to be able to calm the enchanted ocean, so the sea lies dazzlingly still, and the hypnotized winds are like dreaming. And the midnight moon is weaving</p>
<p>Her crystalline gauze to cover the sea, the sea's chest gently rising and falling,</p>
<p>Like a sleeping infant: So the soul bows to you, to listen to you, to worship you; with an abundant and tender emotion, like the overflowing of the summer sea.</p>
<p>[This poem is a lyrical masterpiece by Byron, written in 1815 and published in his "Collected Poems" in 1816. In various poetry selections compiled by later generations, this poem is often included, but most lack a title. The translator has specifically checked its title from the complete works and translated it as above. —Translator]</p>
<h3>Love's Philosophy</h3>
<p>— By Shelley, Translated by Fengli</p>
<p>The fountains mingle with the river</p>
<p>And the rivers with the ocean,</p>
<p>The winds of heaven mix for ever</p>
<p>With a sweet emotion;</p>
<p>Nothing in the world is single,</p>
<p>All things by a law divine</p>
<p>In one spirit meet and mingle—</p>
<p>Why not I with thine?</p>
<p>See the mountains kiss high heaven</p>
<p>And the waves clasp one another;</p>
<p>No sister-flower would be forgiven</p>
<p>If it disdained its brother;</p>
<p>And the sunlight clasps the earth,</p>
<p>And the moonbeams kiss the sea—</p>
<p>What are all these kissings worth</p>
<p>If thou kiss not me?</p>
<h3>Song</h3>
<p>— By E. Allan Poe, Translated by Peiyin</p>
<p>I saw thee on thy bridal day—</p>
<p>When a burning blush came o'er thee,</p>
<p>Though happiness around thee lay,</p>
<p>The world all love before thee.</p>
<p>And in thine eyes</p>
<p>A kindling light</p>
<p>(Which was not least)</p>
<p>Was yet the more beloved, more dear</p>
<p>Than all things else to me.</p>
<p>That blush, perhaps, was maiden shame—</p>
<p>As such it was the best to see—</p>
<p>Though it had raised a purer flame</p>
<p>In love's own bower for thee!</p>
<p>I saw thee on thy bridal day—</p>
<p>When a burning blush came o'er thee,</p>
<p>Though happiness around thee lay,</p>
<p>The world all love before thee.</p>

<h3>Dreams Outside the Tower Poetry</h3>
<p>— Xu Chengyu</p>
<p>Listening to the Zither Song</p>
<p>The husband's ambition is majestic across the four seas, yet he gathers the four seas into one heart. Burn incense, sweep the floor, and sit with closed eyes. Suddenly, I hear the rustling of pine trees, writing the intention in my heart, due to the zither on your fingers. The strings on your fingers turn and turn, the white sun is late in the clear autumn of Wuxia; the cries of the black apes on the mountain peaks are lower, and the sound in the lonely clouds gradually fades away; the flying and flowing springs worry about being endless, the clear business of the green water turns gently; the spring is ten thousand years, the autumn leaves are outside the heart and soul, and the aftersound lingers in dreams; shifting emotions three thousand miles across the sea, peeping at the moon twelve times on the trestle; at this time, the river moon and river water are clear and boundless, and the clear water and moon wash away the secluded feelings, and the hills and valleys come into life in the strings and fingers. The mournful sound suddenly changes to mournful, the intestines break in the wind and snow of Guanshan; Yi Shui Jing Ke Song Dynasty song, Heqiao Su Wu Li Ling farewell; looking up at the floating clouds at the beginning, Qiankun Wan accounted for the passing of crows. Worldly fame and fortune are not worth mentioning, so don't neglect the taste of the zither.</p>
<p>The Wolf Nature of Dogs</p>
<p>"The Call of the Wild" is indeed a great book, it not only shows the existence of the wolf nature of dogs, but even implies the source of the savage legacy of humans... Similar in tone to this book, it should be the British poet's "Beauty Fox"? On the surface, it writes absurdly and ridiculously about the savagery of a person turning into a fox, but in reality, the fox transformation of the mind is not limited to women.</p>
<p>'Wagging its tail and begging for pity' is the growth of the acquired servility of dogs after being domesticated, but 'a dog jumping over the wall in desperation' is a spark of its natural nature that has not been completely extinguished; isn't it? Although a dog is loyal to its master, it still has its wolf nature.</p>
<p>However, in order to adapt to the conditions of survival, the dog is a weakling. If it wants to survive, it must consider the conditions of survival. It knows deeply the treachery of human beings and the rise of the desire to rule, so it bows its head and submits at the feet of human beings in order to seek shelter under the great topic of "looking at the owner when beating a dog."</p>
<p>However, the dog still has its servile sorrow, because ungrateful human beings often cook the running dog after the cunning rabbit dies. The despicable thing about a dog is not that it barks and shadows the power of others, but that it does not know that the end is coming.</p>
<p>Wolves cannot be eliminated, but what about dogs? With cunning rabbits, they can survive. When the cunning rabbits are all dead, there may only be wolves and dogs with wolfish nature in the world.</p>
<h3>Winter Sunshine (Oil Painting)</h3>
<p>— English Churchill</p>
<h3>Picking Bristlegrass</h3>
<p>— Sudan</p>
<p>In the green grass outside the city, there grows a kind of grass called bristlegrass. Inside its rolled leaves, there is a soft, cottony white pistil, which has no taste or strong fragrance. It is a kind of wild plant that no one will pay attention to, but it is the food for a group of children.</p>
<p>The children, thin and clumsy, as long as it is a sunny day, they will come out of their dilapidated thatched huts, in twos and threes, inviting each other to run back and forth among the barren tombs.</p>
<p>They squat on the grass, heads lowered, turning a pair of inflexible and lackluster eyes, moving their bodies with their thin legs clamped, like thin crabs, swinging back and forth. As they pick, they peel out the soft, cottony white pistil and stuff it into their mouths to chew. Before they swallow it, they always chew it repeatedly for a while, just like the children in the city chewing gum. However, who knows whether they feel it is delicious or difficult to swallow. Darting from this tomb to that tomb—Sister, come over here to pick—there are so many here, brother!</p>
<p>In the silent atmosphere, the sound of summoning rises from time to time. A tuft of dense bristlegrass, a fat white pistil, will bring an incomparably happy smile to a pale little face.</p>
<p>Gradually, they accumulate a large handful of bristlegrass in their hands. When their hands can't hold it, they tie it into a bundle with long rattan grass and put it aside. They want to accumulate more, in order to take it home and share it with their smaller siblings.</p>
<p>Rotten coffins and broken skulls are exposed in front of them, but they do not make them scream. They squat beside it picking and eating, with no expression on their faces. A skeleton, a piece of coffin, has already decorated their day's life.</p>
<p>They have a beautiful blue sky behind them, with silk-like white clouds floating in the blue sky, and several soaring, exquisite pigeons casting a melodious and clear ringing sound; sometimes, a silver plane flying over with the roar of engines that shocks the fields is rare to make them look up. Everything, everything seems far away from them, except for the bristlegrass in front of them.</p>
<p>Often, men and women from the city drive cars to the suburbs to enjoy the spring. Their colorful and elegant clothes will attract their frequent glances; they stand on the tombs, casting strange eyes at those men and women who are talking and laughing unrestrainedly. When those men and women sit down for a picnic, they flock together to watch. After the picnic is over, the gentle and quiet they start robbing for a piece of leftover bread crumbs, a jam jar, a brandy bottle... After a push, shove, and fight, some lick the jam jars or bread crumbs, some blow the remaining air in the wine bottle, and some cry with wide eyes, while the bored tourists laugh interestingly as they leave.</p>
<p>However, when the car takes away a burst of laughter, the gentle and quiet children gather together again and return to the tomb to squat and pick bristlegrass, to search for their spring rations.</p>
<h3>Longing for Utopia</h3>
<p>— Newspaper Boy</p>
<p>After reading Plato's "Republic" and Moore's "Utopia," looking at this vast world, I always feel a little disappointed. Even if I read Kang Youwei's "Book of Great Harmony," we cannot help but admire the broad strides of this present-day scholar in thought. Naturally, since it is named "Republic," written as "Utopia," and called "Book of Great Harmony," they are all utopian lands, with no sense of reality. But it is not necessarily so. This world does not need Mr. Owen to artificially run the kingdom of heaven on the New World. There is indeed a Peach Blossom Spring outside the world. The following is the news report from this newspaper on the 14th:</p>
<p>"Orchid Island is located in Taitung, and the residents are all natives, belonging to the Yami tribe of the mountain tribes. On Orchid Island, the hills are continuous and the temperature is very high. It is a primitive society. There are a total of six tribes on the entire island. Family institutions may or may not exist. There are no chiefs. The residents are extremely simple and have no distinction between classes, wealth, nobility, or inferiority. They love peace and do not like fighting. They live together, work at sunrise, and rest at sunset. After work, they play with their bellies full, sing in the bright moon, without hunger, without thieves, without fraud, and without war. They do not know the happiness bestowed on mankind by civilization, nor do they know the pain brought to mankind by civilization. It is truly the Peach Blossom Spring of the East and the Utopia of the West."</p>
<p>Reading this cable, we seem to be reviewing a hope, or reciting a poem. The reporter seems to be fully moved and longed for it when he wrote it. Naturally, as a reader, the feeling is the same. What we idealize today is a world without hunger, without thieves, without fraud, and without war. What we pursue today is originally a society without classes, wealth, or nobility. Think about it, working at sunrise, resting at sunset, playing with your belly full, and singing in the bright moon. This is the highest state of life. In the history of social development, these were originally the circumstances of primitive society, but history has made human beings take a long road. Civilization has transformed the world, but it has brought pain and happiness. Human beings are about to miss and pursue the lives of their ancestors again.</p>
<p>This reminds me of what a scientist said:</p>
<p>"Our mistake lies in the fact that science has surpassed morality. We know too much about atoms and too little about ourselves. We should call for a pause in science to give humans a chance to relearn the golden rules."</p>
<p>This kind of sigh is not without reason. When morality has not yet been established and human relations have not been corrected, science and civilization often bring a small amount of happiness and a lot of pain. It not only cannot make the world progress, but instead leads to social division. As for the fact that the Nobel Prize has become an accomplice to war and aggression, such as the British research on radio waves and the design of germ bombs, and Professor Leeches' invention of new-style rocket bombs, makes us doubt where the use of scientific civilization lies?</p>
<p>Naturally, civilization is not guilty, and science is not guilty. It is just that human beings' understanding of themselves and their exploration of human relations must also be advanced together. Therefore, if we maintain the communal spirit of our ancestors in scientific civilization, then this vast world will be more worthy of pursuit and longing than the island.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Remembering Tan Sitong - A Comet in the Intellectual World of the Late Qing Dynasty</h3>
<p>— Minzi</p>
<p>Tan Sitong, a native of Liuyang, studied arithmetic in his youth and achieved considerable attainments. He also read the so-called "Investigative Studies" translations, adopted all the scientific knowledge at the time as much as possible, liked to write parallel prose, liked to talk about famous theories, and also used the meanings of "peace" and "great harmony" of present-day scholars as the ultimate standard of "worldly law," and was connected to Buddhism. Although childish and complex theories are inevitable, he was able to leap out of the shackles of old ideas and create a unique style, which can be said to have no second person in the previous Qing Dynasty.</p>
<p>His so-called "scientific" work is only one volume of Renxue (Benevolence). In the book, he expresses his anger and resentment by pretending to be Taiwanese, severely criticizing the Qing court, so it is also called "The Book Written by Taiwanese." This book combines science, philosophy, and religion into one furnace, which can be said to be a bold attempt at the time. His purpose in writing this Renxue was to "break through the net," which is clearly stated in his preface. He wants to break through the net of profit, the net of vulgar learning such as textual research and diction, the net of global collective learning and collective teaching, the net of monarchs, the net of ethics, and the net of heaven, etc.</p>
<p>He tried his best to eliminate the concept of respecting the ancients. He said: "If the ancients are good, why not be the people of today!" Regarding Chinese history, he also made such a criticism: "For more than a thousand years, the government has been the government of Qin, all great thieves; for more than two thousand years, learning has been the learning of Xunzi, all hypocrites. Only great thieves use hypocrites, and only hypocrites are good at flattering great thieves." He said it very thoroughly and happily. And regarding good and evil, he also has a unique view. He said that there is no such thing as good and evil in the world, evil is just a name, not real. He also said that ordinary scholars regard heavenly reason as good and human desire as sad, but they do not know that if there is no human desire, where does heavenly reason come from. He wants to prove the saying that "evil arises from names," and he has the following words:</p>
<p>"The greatest evils are licentiousness and killing... The union of men and women is called licentiousness, this is the name of licentiousness. The name of licentiousness has been practiced for a long time since the beginning of life. If the name is not changed, it is customary to call it evil. If at the beginning of life, people were accustomed to using licentiousness as a grand ceremony for courtships and banquets, held in courts and temples, held in cities, in crowded places, like the kneeling worship of the people of China, and the hugging and kissing of the people of the West, then who would know that it is evil. Harming life is called killing, this is the name of killing. However, if killing is evil, then all killing should be evil. If people should not be killed, then why should tigers, wolves, cattle, horses, chickens, and pigs be killed? Why not have the same evil name? Or it is said that people are of the same kind, then tigers and wolves are not of the same kind as people. If tigers and wolves kill people, then tigers and wolves are named evil, why not name people evil for killing tigers and wolves?..."</p>
<p>Although this is close to sophistry, his spirit of doubt and courage to liberate his thoughts are worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>Regarding famous teachings, he openly slanders them. He said:</p>
<p>"Vulgar scholars and humble actions often speak of famous teachings... If names are taken as teachings, then their teachings have become the guests of reality, and are definitely not reality. Moreover, names are created by people, and superiors use them to control their subordinates, and subordinates cannot but follow them, then the tragic disasters of the three cardinal guides and five constant virtues for thousands of years have come from this... For example, if it is called "benevolence", then it is a common name; monarchs and fathers use it to blame ministers and sons, and ministers and sons can also turn it back on monarchs and fathers. It is inconvenient in the art of restriction, so there must be the names of "loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and fidelity" and all other distinctions and levels,... Since loyalty and filial piety are the exclusive names of ministers and sons, they can never be used to reverse it. Although there may be other grounds for wanting to question and sue, it will never be a match for the name of loyalty and filial piety as the most esteemed of famous teachings... Wherever names are, they not only close their mouths so that they dare not speak out, but also imprison their hearts so that they dare not even think about it...."</p>
<p>The second volume of Renxue is mostly political commentary. From his thoughts, it can be seen that he is a worshiper of cosmopolitanism. He said, "According to the meaning of unification in the Spring and Autumn Period, there should be no country between heaven and earth." He also said, "Not only should we vow to save our own country, but also the most prosperous Western countries and all living beings, everything should be saved... We should not say that we are citizens of a certain country, but we should treat all countries equally, all as our countries and all as our people." As for "those who vow to save their own country," he advocated the anti-Manchu revolution with a spirit of martyrdom, and his words were sharp and unstoppable. He said this:</p>
<p>"The world is the private property of monarchs, not starting today... However, are there those who know the crimes of Liao, Jin, Yuan, and Qing, floating above the monarchs before this? Their soil is filthy, their people are barbaric, their hearts are bestial, their customs are debauched. They indulge in their ferocity and cruelty, plundering the daughters and sons of the Central Plains and their jade and silk... still thinking that it is not enough, imprisoning their eyes and ears, shackling their hands and feet, suppressing their thoughts, and frustrating their integrity... commanding and saying that this is the duty of eating their food and treading their soil. Who is eating whose food and who is treading whose soil?"</p>
<p>He always wanted to promote the spirit of the people and advocate the spirit of bravery, so he set up the Shiwu Academy in Changsha with Huang Zunxian and Neng Xiling. At that time, Liang Qichao was hired as the chief lecturer and Tang Caichang as the assistant teacher. The students included Cai E, Li Binghuan, and others, forty in number. They were taught the books of Gongyang and Mencius. Liang Qichao spent four hours in the classroom every day, and corrected students' notes at night, sometimes without sleeping all night. And what he talked about was the theory of civil rights at the time, and also many old stories of the Qing Dynasty, listing the failures of the government and advocating revolution. As for his discussion of scholarship, he criticized the scholars of the Han, Tang, Song, Ming, and Qing dynasties completely. After this, he set up the "Southern Society" to gather lectures, and also set up the Xiang Newspaper (daily) and the Xiang Xue Newspaper (ten-day), and the opinions expressed, although not as intense as in the school, were actually responding to each other secretly.</p>
<p>This method and effort of propagating revolution once caused a great commotion among the new and old factions in Hunan. Before the coup of 1898, a certain censor listed dozens of notes and comments, pointing out those who criticized the Qing court and advocated civil rights, and submitted a memorial to reveal it, which eventually led to a major prison case. The result was that the school was disbanded, Tang Caichang and others were expelled, Liang Qichao fled to Japan, and Tan Sitong was martyred. He was only twenty-three years old when he died.</p>
<p>Liang Qichao, in the midst of mourning, once said this:</p>
<p>"... If heaven had given him years, then his learning would be immeasurable. Only this small volume (Renxue) is left, with ten thousand feet of light, fleeting in a glimpse. And the power of sweeping away and purifying is unmatched. Therefore, I compare him to a comet."</p>
<h3>A Story of Deception</h3>
<p>— A-bing</p>
<p>Recently, I saw a very humorous and ordinary little story in a children's newspaper. In this "deception" prevailing, I don't know how many such stories are being created among the so-called "ruler and minister, father and son, brothers, husband and wife, and friends." The story is like this:</p>
<p>There was a little boy who always had two tubes of snot running down his nose. His grandfather said to him, "Child, if you wipe away your snot, I will give you five hundred yuan!" The little boy sucked the snot into his nostrils and asked his grandfather for money. His grandfather said, "I was deceiving you." The little boy let the snot run out and said, "I was also deceiving you."</p>
<h3>Random Talks While Alone</h3>
<p>— Wang Cong</p>
<p>Shakespeare said:</p>
<p>"The comfort of love is like sunlight after rain." Shakespeare also said in another aspect: "Comfort that comes too late is like a pardon after an execution."</p>
<p>There is a type of girl who is indecisive about her own love, seemingly affectionate to everyone. A pure and honest nature is valuable, but misleading oneself and others only leads to tragedy. Because if you compassionately lend your bed to a beggar, he will surely repay you with lice.</p>
<p>Playing with love is like playing with fire; a moment of carelessness can lead to self-immolation. Therefore, I often advise many friends who are deeply in love not to try to transform into three thousand and universally save all beings.</p>
<p>Because the most persistent love is the most valuable love.</p>
<p>Because love is not a reward, let alone a commodity.</p>
<p>Geo. Moore said: "Choice is the most difficult thing in life." (The difficulty in life is the choice)</p>
<p>Before love arises, there should be a choice, and this choice is even more difficult than choosing a job. My reason is: a "tide of desire" like a raging wave obscures reason between the sexes. Therefore, careful selection is not allowed. This "tide of desire" is often mistaken for "love." This is almost a universally absurd phenomenon among us so-called spiritual beings.</p>
<p>Therefore, a union under this absurd misconception is like a pagoda built on sand. It cannot withstand the test of time.</p>
<p>Many marriages break down in a short period because of this.</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Guan told me that after each sexual desire is satisfied with his wife, a kind of indescribable aversion arises between them. Even a casual touch of skin immediately ignites anger. However, before the issue of desire is resolved, they both feel a strong interest in each other. Because of this, both parties feel contradictory and painful.</p>
<p>This is truly a good example. I believe many people would feel the same way, but they just haven't said it.</p>
<p>What is love? Based on the above views, I say: "It is the infinitely beautiful mutual affection that remains after the tide of desire has subsided. Even, the willingness to sacrifice one's life to bring a smile to the other's face."</p>
<h3>Strange Fire and Spontaneous Combustion</h3>
<p>— Wang Qian De</p>
<p>With the arrival of victory, a new term has also emerged – strange fire. Especially in Shanghai, almost everyone knows this term.</p>
<p>Although some "strange fires" are indeed mysterious, unpredictable by humans or ghosts, emptying warehouses of materials, stored goods, and setting fire to warehouses and houses, turning them to ashes, using the "fire" that cannot speak or accuse to conceal sins and act as a scapegoat, we don't need to study this type of strange fire in detail.</p>
<p>However, another kind of strange fire is actually a phenomenon caused by chemical changes. In natural science books, this phenomenon is called "spontaneous combustion" (Spontaneous Combustion). The occurrence of spontaneous combustion must have the following three prerequisites: (1) The substance itself is flammable.</p>
<p>(2) There are no heat conductors around.</p>
<p>(3) The storage place has poor air circulation.</p>
<p>The substance itself is flammable, meaning that its nature makes it easy to burn, such as matches, coal, alcohol, phosphorus, sulfur, etc.</p>
<p>The absence of heat conductors around means that the building materials of the warehouse are not good conductors of heat, such as warehouses built with wood, causing the stored materials to undergo a slow oxidation reaction with oxygen in the air, and the heat generated has no transmitter to send it out, causing the temperature inside the warehouse to gradually rise. If the temperature continues to rise to the ignition point (Kindling Tem perturemperture) of this substance, a fire will easily occur.</p>
<p>The last reason is to close the doors and windows of the warehouse tightly, so that the hot air inside cannot exchange and circulate with the cooler air outside, thus maintaining the permanent hot air inside.</p>
<p>Now that we clearly know the above three reasons, avoiding them will certainly not be difficult. Just change the building materials of the warehouse to heat conductors, do not stack the materials tightly, and keep the doors and windows of the warehouse open to allow air exchange. In this way, we can be safe and sound.</p>
<h3>Miscellany from America</h3>
<p>— Xu Shut</p>
<p>The Democratization of the Automobile Class</p>
<p>Things are valued when they are scarce. Shoddy cars from America can be sold for ten or eight "strips" (slang for banknotes) in Shanghai. Those old, worn-out cars are already sold by the ton as scrap metal in America. When I went to America in 1942, I still saw used cars being auctioned for forty dollars each. Five years later, I still saw used cars for two or three hundred dollars. New cars from 1946 that our colleagues bought cost at most one thousand six hundred dollars each. Almost new ones could be had for one thousand two hundred dollars, and ordinary ones that were usable cost around five or six hundred dollars. Buying a car doesn't require paying in full at once. Pay twenty percent of the price upfront, and then pay ten percent monthly. The car becomes entirely your property. Therefore, any American or resident in America can become part of the automobile class if they can scrape together a hundred or so dollars. Newspaper carriers deliver newspapers by car, and barbers drive to the barbershop for work.</p>
<p>When I was stationed at Thunderbird Field, I often rode into town in the barber's car. The maids who came to the dormitory to sweep and change bedsheets also drove their own cars to work. Normally, each family averaged one or two cars.</p>
<p>During wartime, because ships and gasoline were rationed, instead of everyone riding in their own car, four or five people shared one car, with everyone splitting the gasoline costs and taking turns driving. Cars were also rotated. In the military mess hall or club, the public bulletin board was filled with advertisements seeking passengers: Passengers Wanteo or Share Carneeded or I Want a ride to New York, a dazzling array. At major intersections, there were large signs saying "Please give soldiers a ride." Anyone wearing a military uniform waiting by the roadside would have passing cars stop and take them to their destination, or to the tram stop, without having to spend a single copper. Americans believe that there is no loss in giving a few more people a ride in a car. In the eyes of the automobile class in China, giving people a free ride in a car is not only not cost-effective, but also quite embarrassing. (Five)</p>
<h3>Rambling on Street Names</h3>
<p>— Shen Ying</p>
<p>Many roads in Shanghai have been renamed to suit reality. When new road names are given, many people still call them by their old names. This is because they are used to it, and they gradually become familiar with the new names.</p>
<p>Because Shanghai is a national metropolis, the newly changed road names often use the names of cities in various regions or the names of famous people. The former is easier to remember, and the latter is intended to commemorate. This is the origin of naming. The "Hu" character in the Huzhou Pass on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway is relatively difficult to recognize. Legend has it that when Emperor Qianlong went down the Yangtze River via the Grand Canal, he read the "Hu" character as "Xu" by mistake, and the error was passed on. Even now, many people still pronounce it as "Xu." Therefore, when naming places and roads, it is best to use words that are common and easy to recognize. The names of streets and alleys in Suzhou are quite ancient and interesting, or related to local historical anecdotes. For example, Dongmi Lane (East Rice Lane), Ximi Lane (West Rice Lane), and Cangmi Lane (Granary Rice Lane) in the west of the city were rice trading markets during the Song Dynasty. Nearby, a stream flows windingly, directly connected to the city moat. The bridge is called "Shashi Bridge" (Slaughter Market Bridge). As the name suggests, it should be a grain gathering place, and Cangmi Lane was a granary. Furthermore, Huajie (Flower Street), Liuxiang (Willow Lane), Youlan (Quiet Orchid), and Zilan (Purple Orchid), the names of the lanes are fragrant and seductive. The flowers and plants of the Wu Palace at that time were nestled among them. Even now, thinking of them still evokes reverie. As for Huxiangsi Lane (Mutual Longing Lane) and Sipo Lane (Longing Wife Lane) in the east of the city, both have stories implied, and they are recorded in local chronicles, so I will not repeat them. However, Huxiangsi Lane, in the names of streets and lanes, is named quite humorously. Even the witty and humorous Lin Yutang would have to admit defeat.</p>
<p>Hulong Street is the longest street in the center of Suzhou City, starting from Yinma Bridge in the south and reaching Beisi Pagoda in the north. In Suzhou dialect, it is called Mashi Street. It has recently been renamed "Zhongzheng" Road. Wusa Road (May 30th Road) commemorates the May 30th Massacre. A lane parallel to it has recently been renamed "Zhongren Road" in memory of Mr. Zhang Zhongren (一 ), a local elder. Chu Zhanglin is in the park. These are all names commemorating local people. Looking back on the past, the names of every street and alley have their origins to be examined. As for naming alleys after people, it is not an imitation of foreign countries. There is a Jiusi Lane in Suzhou, which commemorates Zhang Shicheng of the late Yuan Dynasty, because Zhang Shicheng's nickname was Jiusi.</p>
