<p>〔中央社南京廿二日電〕改組後之國員政府委員會定廿三日正式成立，同時新任國府委員及五院院長宣吿正式就職，並不另舉行宣誓就職儀式。據悉，明日開會時將首由文官長吳鼎昌說明政府改組之意義，繼爲蔣主席致詞，詞畢略事休息，即正式開會。討論議程爲國府委員會議之規則。聞行政院改組問題，亦將提出討論，並決定政務委員及兼各部會首長之人選。</p>
<p>〔又電〕民社黨另一府委之人選問題，該黨人士均屬望於徐傅霖，徐氏自來京謁蔣主席後，對此事迄在考慮中，據蔣勻田稱，大概已無問題。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕中常會國防曾定廿三日晨九時舉行聯席會議。此殆爲國防會最後一次集會，因府委會於同日成立，今後國防會之職務，大部將移交府委會。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕國府改組後，五院副院長最近亦將另行遴選。魏道明出任台省主席，立院副院長遺缺將由何人繼任，短期內當可發表，焦易堂，劉哲或爲可能人選。惟聞民靑兩黨亦頗有意於此。其他監院，司法院副院長自劉尙淸，覃振相繼謝世後，亦有待另選。目前所可知者，僅爲考試院副院長周鍾嶽或將蟬聯。政院副院長已內定由王雲五出任。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕民社黨戢翼翹，胡海門，二十二日晨自滬抵京，雷震同來。三氏先後訪張羣，晤談改組政院問題。徐傅霖定二十三夜車赴滬，參加府委事，赴滬後決定。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕雷震廿二日晚在寓所宴請民社黨徐傅霖，蔣勻田，戢翼翹，胡海門，並邀邵力子作陪。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕靑年黨左舜生廿二日下午八時許由滬抵京，即赴普陀路陳實出席靑年黨中常曾，討論參加政院問題，人選雖已內定，但因參加政府事尙待與政府商洽，加入之辦法，例如參加地方政府等，故該項名單今晚未送出，定廿三日晨再集會討論。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕新府委宋子文七二日九時半目滬抵京，將參加廿三百召開之改組後首次府委會議。</p>

<h3>各部會人選擬定　政委名單即公布　張羣今廣播政局見解</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕張羣於出席府委會後，即就職，不另舉行就職禮。張氏即日到政院視事後，可能即舉行記者招待會，發表長政院後之施政方針，即晚七時在中央電台向全國廣播；（該台以中波六六〇週率，短波九七三〇及一一八三五週率播送）聞其內容甚爲切實，乃就國內政治，經濟，財政，外交以及解決國內糾紛等，提出具體見解。全文長千餘言。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕政院政委人選決定爲七名國民黨兩名雷震，鍾天心，民社黨李大明，蔣勻田，靑年黨楊永浚，常乃惠，社會賢達繆雲台，二十三日首次常委會中通過後公布。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕行政院各部會人選，業經張羣擬定，呈最高當局核閱中，即交廿三日府委會通過，名單如次：</p>
<p>內政部長　張厲生</p>

<p>交通部長　兪大維</p>
<p>社會部長　谷正綱</p>
<p>糧食部長　谷正倫</p>
<p>司法行政　部長謝冠生</p>
<p>郵電部　（緩設）</p>
<p>資源委員會委員長　翁文灝</p>
<p>蒙藏委員會委員長　許世英</p>
<p>僑務委員會委員長　劉維識</p>
<h3>蕭錚請辭經次</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕經次　錚已向當局辭職多次，自二十一日起即未到部辦公。蕭氏所創建國法商學院開學多日，蕭自兼院長，難兼行政工作，故擬暫行擺脫政務，專心從事敎育。</p>
<h3>胡海門戰翼翹　參加國府聲明</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿二日電〕中國民主社會黨胡海門，戢翼翹，廿二日發表參加國府之聲明，其原文如次：　民主社會黨參加國大，其目的在求通過一合於政協原則的憲法，樹立民主憲政的楷模，使吾國民主向前一步，雖共產黨堅持其主張，未參加國大，誠屬一件憾事。然民主憲法的公布，即民主政治實施始基，在政治上是結束了國　黨一黨專政，而走上民主的大道。</p>
<p>民主憲法公布后，本黨自不希望其成爲具文，尙有有關行憲諸問題如選舉法及其他法律的制定等，均非國民黨一黨可能獨任，所以本黨又決定參加四機構。</p>
<p>本黨爲國家社會黨與民主憲政黨合併而成，迄今尙在籌備組織時期中，本擬以在野黨的身份一面培養本身的發展，一面協助政府以行憲，期作一二十年的奮關，使吾國實行民主社會主義。因抱定此項宗旨，故在二月十五日參加四機構聲明中，曾有「至於祖負決策與行政之實任，待之全國各黨一致協力於和平民主之日」之言。</p>
<p>但事與願違，國民黨政府當局懇切表示，在此過渡時期中，各黨派如不參加改組政府，國防最高委員會無法取銷，國民黨一黨訓政亦遂無法結束，本黨歷年來力主以和平方法實行民主憲政，並反對任何方式的一黨專政，今日國民旣有結束一黨專政的意思，本黨自不能拒人於千里之外。因之，就有共同施政方針十二點的簽訂，以及參加改組政府的決定，本黨希望從這十二點中反映出一些人民的呼籲，而作本黨代表一部份人民參加政府，督促行政實施上適應人民的要求。吾們要明告天下的，這次參加政府，是帮助政府結束訓政，絕對反對三黨共同訓政的說法，吾們的行動，是爲求民主政治的實現，是爲解人民於倒懸，不是以一個黨取得訓政地位，更不是爲黨的本身謀什麼利益，吾們並且還可以很誠懇的吿訴國人，吾們這次參加政府，是保留有進退的自由的，是具有犧牲的準備的。</p>
<p>所以本黨這次參加改組的政府，以十二項爲基本綱領，而其要義不外乎三：第一，促成吾國和平統一，第二，確立民主法治的基礎，第三，代表人民謀解除其痛苦，並减少社會的紊亂，本黨本負責的精神，期實現以上所定的政綱，謹以此正吿國人，希望全國人民做吾們的後盾，並以此與本黨同仁互勉。</p>

<p>〔又電〕國軍湯恩伯丘團昨起向臨沂北部共軍開始反擊，戰果輝煌，東路進駐駐臨沂·莒縣間之湯頭鎭，該處距臨沂四十二華里，爲共軍溝通沂河兩岸迎繫之重要據點，附近架有浮橋五座，國軍據此，已使沂河東岸與沂蒙山區共軍連繫切斷。中路進一駐臨沂·沂水間之茶葉山，該山距臨沂四十華里，爲屛障臨沂北部之唯一高地。西路進駐臨沂，蒙陰間之半程，該地距臨沂四十五華里，爲臨沂通蒙陰之咽喉，所有以上各據點，均經共軍經營歷七年，設有堅强工事，在該綫頑抗之共軍，似以第六縱隊爲主力，遭湯兵團之英勇痛擊，即向北潰退，湯兵團仍乘勝北追中。</p>

<h3>改善議價的必要</h3>
<p>最近這一次漲風，其原因很多。而且各種物品上漲，其原因也不盡相同。如食米一項，說是由於產價報漲，油價由於原料缺乏，紗布由於原料昂貴，客銷發動等等，因而抑平的對策，也不得不從多面設法，這自然是一定不易的道理。不過要撲滅投機，消弭黑市，對於議價的運用，似也還有改進的必要。</p>
<p>當局對於抑平物價，除掉運用貸款，疎導來源，增進生產等治本的辦法外，其治標辦法，似乎不外兩種，一是硬性的，即採取議價方式，導入合理的與正當的途徑。如此雙管齊下，剛柔並濟，如果運用得宜，似於物價方面，多少可以收到相當緩和的功效。</p>
<p>不過照最近旬日間的市面看來，漲風極為熾烈。即偶起回風，亦無非大漲小回，仍循曲綫上升。而且黑市異常猖獗，投機商風起雲湧。在顧全體面的廠家，則以遵守議價，明白虧本之故，無不忍痛犧牲，怨聲載道。這在紗布一方面，其情形最為顯著。從而當局嚴查嚴辦的手段，也並未收到大效。這其中，並沒有甚麼奧妙。只因利潤太厚，賺錢太快，在投機商自不惜百方取巧，樂於以身試法。而在生產商則以坐失大利，未免可惜，也不得不出於行險徼倖，走向黑市的一途。</p>
<p>假如市價能隨時調整，勿使過於脫節，則暴利減少，投機的氣燄，自可大減。而供給方面，以所虧不大，亦未必樂於違法，紛紛私售黑市。照評議物價實施辦法第十三條之規定，在物品成本發生劇烈變動，有評定新價之必要時，本許重新議價，其間並沒有時間上之限制。又同辦法第十條載；物品成本之計算，除製造費或進貨原價外，得包括利息，捐稅，運費，倉租，管理費，保險費。折耗等項在內。照此規定，則合理的價格，並不難求得。而且第十三條但書同，又明定：但未經核定前，不得加價。其違反核定之議價者，第十五條又規定，得依取締違反限價議價條例懲處。果能照此辦理，非但商民方面，不至亂闖亂摸，易蹈法綱。卽官廳執法之繩，在執行時，亦可增加許多便利，所以不談議價則已，旣經實施議價，則及時的與合理的調整，似屬必要。</p>
<p>有人以為議價屢屢變動，豈非助長物價？在這物資缺乏，供求不能投合之時，此弊誠所不免。不過在這種場合，如果沒有根本的救濟之法，而單靠消極的辦法來遏止，事實上，本是疑問。卽如近來，當局的監察，罰辦，未嘗不雷厲風行，努力從事，而漲風終難消滅，黑市依然猖獗，也可說是一個明證。與其拘定議價，不予變通，而反使黑市猖獗，莫可遏抑，倒不如依法調整，還可以收到相當緩和的功效。</p>
<p>拿紗價來說軒以，近時成本已的確在到五百萬左右，而議價始終還在四百萬關內。這種不合理的限制，據說：當局也很明白。不過一經調整，未免要提高議價，卽未免要遭到指摘。不如熟視無覩，任其自然，在個人，倒可以避免責任。不知此等作風，實際上無異造成黑市，助長投機，使追求近利的商人，相率採取不正當的行徑。而國家所定的議價政策，則無形中便要減損其信用和價值。我們認為議價政策，還沒有明白變更以前，這實在是一種不智的而且是不負責的行動。</p>

<h3>馬歇爾電促參院　通過援助希發案　謂渠對該方案完全贊同</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿一日電〕參議院討論杜魯門總統之援助希臘土耳其方案，將於明日付表決，定可通過。參院外交委員會主席范登堡今日當塲宣讀國務卿馬歇爾自莫斯科來電稱：「范登堡參議員台鑒二頃悉關於本人參與援助希臘土耳其方案一事，已引起若干問題。余在啓程赴莫斯科前曾參與此一方案之草擬及決定工作，乃足下所知。三月廿六日余牴巴黎時，總統以三月十二日擬就提出國會之咨文電余，余即通告國務院表示完全同意。余個人及國務院，曾摧促援助法案應立即予以通過。余意此項方案乃屬必要，國務院艾克遜君（副國務卿）與參院外交委員會主席催促國會通過此案，余完全贊同」。馬歇爾此電係因共和黨參議員韋萊之質問而起。韋氏上星期曾吿參院稱，外間謠傳馬歇爾對於援助希土政策，並不完全贊同云。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿一日電〕杜魯門與馬歇爾兩人今日作重要佈置，以支持預料可在明日通過於參議院之援助希土案。杜魯門重申其支持此項抵抗近東共產主養之措施，同時馬歇爾亦接踵而起，自莫斯科來函，促參院通過所允諾之四億元貸款，認爲此事乃屬「最關緊要者」。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿一日電〕美國共和黨參議員福開森自中東返國，頃發表談話，對於美國援助希土兩國之計劃表示贊同。據稱，欲使蘇聯停止其對於土耳其之神經戰，唯一辦法厥爲由土蘇兩國成立協定，保證土國之邊界。余主張將現存埃及與伊朗之租借物資轍往希臘及土耳其。余並不以爲英國對此將表示異議，吾人刻正爲英國卸除其在近東之負擔，但英國仍將分享其利益。土耳其一日須將其預算之大半用諸保持批軍隊，該國即一日不能在政治上及經濟上提高其地位。聯合國機構實必須取得充分之權力，保蹬小國邊界之不可侵犯，俾美國需在每次新危機威脅世界安全時，被請出而干涉云。</p>

<h3>四外長秘密會議　商對奧和約難題　德國問題勢將暫予擱置</h3>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科廿二日電〕四國外長今日舉行第二次秘密會議，企岡消除對奧和約之異見。據權威方面稱：「在本心驚肉跳會議中，究成對奧和約之希望，尙未完全斷絕。」</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科廿一日電〕四國外長會議於本日午後五時四十五分時，美國國務卿馬歇爾元帥認爲長此討論下去，與事無益，乃建議舉行秘密會議，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫當即表示同意。據主管方面人士談稱：馬帥在秘密會議中曾詢問三國外長對於若干尙未成立協議之基本要點是吾仍堅持原議，殆必詢問莫洛托夫外長蘇聯政府是吾答覆渠於四月一日秘密會議時對於自德國現行生產提取賠款一項問題所提出之建議，雙方如無重行考慮之餘地，則馬歇爾將要求外長會議休會，但須規定下次會議之時間及地點。及至秘密會議散會後，各方面對於此次秘密會議是吾成功，揣測不一，但亦謂奧境德產問題以及奧國邊界問題不久即可解決。四國外長會議將不再討論德國問題，殆可斷言，甚至在美國方面亦謂此次秘密會議僅討論對奧和約問題。此在英國外相貝文與法國外長皮杜爾則在若干日以前，即認爲此種亳無結果之辯論，應即停止進行，惟有由各國外長從長計議之後，重新舉行，始有成立協議可能。四國外長會議若散會，則四國外長均未達成其目標。質言之馬歇兩元帥未能使德國經濟統一，英國外相貝文未能减輕英國納稅人之負担，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫未能自德國西部獲得賠款，法國外長皮杜爾亦款能滿足其對於薩爾區之要求，僅　得若千煤斤而已。若無薩區，則一切均無便値可言。</p>

<h3>有錢人家不肖子弟　到處濫發支票詐欺　江信誠毫不信誠</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市靑年江信誠，又名江流，曾於三月十一日下午四時，至華山路Ｆ三五八號康生皮鞋店購一雙，價十三萬元，當時付現鈔六萬元，另簽給元亨錢莊七萬元票一張，該支票後因存款不足被退，由店主嚴銀水向向警局報吿。另有常州人袁銀炳，亦控吿江信誠曾於三月九日向其所開設之酒樓，使用十三萬九千元之空頭支票，經警局往元亨錢莊調査，該江信誠係於三月五日開戶，領有支票簿，曾連續開出空頭支票約廿餘張，共計二百三十五萬七千元，其在錢莊所留地址亦屬虛搆，本人無一定住所。四月七日晚十一時，卒由靜安寺　察分局在南京西　安樂坊二十七號渠友人家中，將其拘獲。該案昨日移送地檢處，據江供稱：前曾同樣情形被控許欺，經法院宣吿無罪。其父在本市開設字號，家頗富有，因其在外揮霍無度，故絕其經濟供給，一時無奈，出此下策。承辦檢察官李名山諭知交保，但因其父已遍吿親友，不准爲其子作保，故江信誠無處覓保，仍由法警押回收押。</p>
<h3>洋老量刑太輕　兩市民上書萬言</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕外商違法買賣外匯外幣之「洋老虎」梅斯伯，自地院於本月十四日判處有期徒刑一年，沒收美鈔四萬元，港幣二萬元後，外界頗多議論，有謂孟庭長量刑太輕，有謂禁止外幣券流通辦法本身尙未有法律效力，根本不能處刑，更有人注意數十萬美鈔何以仍璧還原主，除被吿本人及其辯護人已向高院提起上訴與獨立上訴外，昨日地檢處接到居住於北四川路之市民趙力行，陳宗道二人之呈文，認爲地院對梅斯伯判刑太輕，沒收太少，請求檢察官上訴，呈文長達丈餘，洋洋萬言，臚列理由五點，其內容大要：（一）洋老虎藐視我國法令，今我國已躋身五强，不能自卑，梅斯伯所判處之徒刑，僅爲其所犯之罪最高本刑五分之一，顯非允當。（二）經營電匯·信匯，雖非外國幣券之買賣，然外匯不能脫離外幣而獨立，且電匯信匯之惡性，實遠較外幣爲大。（三）埃勃斯公司所抄獲之美鈔三十餘萬元，亦未處分沒收，殊屬不解。（四）埃勃斯公司於二月十八日以後至三月三日破案日止，連續有犯罪行爲，並列舉其每日賬目上數字證明。文稱：售出之外幣外匯，不能諉諸無法收回而不加處分，應將其所得代價（法幣）全數沒收。（五）根據埃勃斯公司賬目，可證明其黑市外匯外幣價格逐日高漲，實係有計劃之操縱。此呈文將由該案原承辦檢察官全匋審閱，對具名之趙陳二市民之身份及動機，或將加以偵査，然後再行決定，是否採納。</p>

<h3>記者羣應邀看海塘　北塘民衆包圍　提出七項要求　工務局負責人角解釋舞弊之說不確</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市海塘，北起吳淞，南迄川沙縣境，共長約十五里許，抗戰期間，失於歲修，損壞甚鉅，工務局乃於卅五年三月起，着手測量，編造預算，搶修缺口，至本年始先後吿成。不意市參議會忽接高橋市民密告，謂工務局有拆塘修塘，轉包舞弊等情，業已引起社會人士之注意。本市記者爲明瞭實際情形，曾要求工務局公佈眞相，工務局乃於昨晨派員陪同本市各報記者十餘人，赴高橋海塘實地勘察。</p>
<p>記者等先趨南塘參觀，該地海塘缺口業已全部工竣，海灘上打下木樁甚多，海岸則堵以亂石砌成之塘堤，並築以混凝土擋土牆，表面雖簡單，工程頗浩大，但見海水衝擊，浪花翻飛，十分壯觀。</p>
<p>嚴辦偷椿工頭　搬回被拆塘石</p>
<p>抵北塘時，記者等所乘之車輛，忽爲當地民衆所包圍，彼等扶老携少，手執五色標語旗幟，頗有留難之意，經記者等解釋後，彼等始推代表，申述意見。據稱有工頭楊義郞，曾將樁木偸至高橋北街七〇號做桶件，應請嚴辦。並提出七項要求：（一）要求將搬去之塘石搬回原處整理，以保本地人之生命財產。（二）將違法舞弊之工程隊有關人員，嚴予究辦。（三）以後保證不再有類似之情事發生。（四）回復原狀須在秋汛之前。（五）回復原狀時，必須通知太區區民代表會之海塘工程監察委員會派員會同辦理，認爲滿意後方可。（六）要求各長官將視察感想作書面報吿，以安民心。（七）要求新聞界爲民衆喉舌，作嚴正之報道，予以與論制裁。</p>
<p>所謂拆塘修塘　由於節省經費</p>
<p>記者等所乘車輛被羣衆所包圍約歷十五分鐘，經記者等允代呼籲後，始克突圍而出。後據工務局負責人對此問題發表意見稱：「巨大舞弊」一事，不能成立，因搬運新港標家宅十四岡至周家浜一段海塘之舊石塊，係由於節省經費，海塘工程隊絕未向政府報銷賬目。對於本次搶救海塘工程之進行，曾經多數專家之硏討設計。民衆所謂「拆塘修塘」，實由於對工程之不明瞭，因疏散於灘邊之碎石，抗禦海水衝擊力僅一分，而經過整理編排，用以以塡補缺口後，其力量即增至十分，則不僅避免經費之消耗，且亦有廢物利用用之至意。况採用該項搶救海塘辦法者，不僅自本市始，江南海塘，早經江蘇省政府採用同法修建。</p>
<p>意見儘可提出　切忌竟氣用事</p>
<p>又所謂「拆塘修塘」者，原係臨時權宜之計，因目前政府經費無着，先行搶救秋汎泛濫，將來仍須築以混凝土擋土牆，以垂永久。現經市府核准之經費爲十二億元，待撥到後即可開始動工。又據工務局負責八稱：若當地居民，對於海塘工程之技術上有意見時，儘可赴工務局提供，然切忌意氣用事，對於工頭之舞弊等情，立盼舉實吿發，工務局決予澈査後法辦，關於居民所稱工頭楊義郞舞弊案，當局已加密查。</p>

<p>開始時，巨人起用皮谷耐主中鋒，其餘爲原班人馬，谷佛列充後備。混戰一番，六比六平手，長人谷佛入替陶勃林基，巨人佈成淸一色的長人陣，仍舊佔不到便宜。華聯的默契傳遞，無懈可華，該是獲勝的主要原因。　籃下球兩隊形成均勢，巨人利用身材，華聯則賴阿弟和大李的努力支撑，巨人頻頻換人，華聯五人作戰到底。</p>
<p>華聯自四比三以後，即一路領前，下半時內，巨人曾追至二十四比二十五，賴老包籃下倫襲成功，這一球有穩定軍心之力·此時，巨人忽以陶矮子人替谷佛，至爲失策，被阿弟連中兩球，奠定大局。</p>
<p>浮尼市穩健，皮谷耐射籃不拘角度，是巨人最出色的兩員，谷佛受制於大李，黯然失色。</p>
<p>在近數塲球賽中，老包已被倚爲獲分的主角，籃下球和罰球，都穩妥可喜。在長人陣中，阿弟仍然是最活躍的一員，僅學祟昨夕，稍失常態。（昌年）</p>

<h3>適應需要便利收付　國行准發萬元券　上海大票存數不多祇能搭機</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：中央銀行爲應全國銀行公會聯合會之請求，及適合社會需要，現已通吿各銀行，錢莊，財政金融機關，各地分支行處，發行國幣一萬元券。茲探誌通告全文如次：「此次全國銀行公會聯合會，在京集會，根據各地代表意見，爲暢通僑匯，推動生產，活潑資金，便利收佬起見，請求發行一萬元券。本行爲適應上述需要，擬即察酌各地情形，陸續發行。該項國幣一萬元券，係中央印製廠及中華書局所承印。除樣本券另行函送外，相應函達，即希査照爲荷。」</p>
<p>又悉：目下廣州西安等地，因僑匯湧到，及棉產待收，需要萬元大券，甚爲殷切。國行方面經已陸續運往發行應用。上海方面，現因大券在數不多，如有需要，祗能少數搭發云</p>
<p>〔又訊〕中央銀行發行局副局長田福璡談：發行萬元大粟與物價問題，據田氏意見，票面額之增加，絕非通貨數量增加之謂。反之，不發大票，亦非通貨不增加之證明。自五百元關金發行以來，事實上萬元票早已與市塲發生關係，何况此次發行萬元大票，完全係適應市場需要，故絕無影響物價之可能云。</p>
<h3>宣司令節嚴密偵防　機機商人淆惑聽聞</h3>
<p>爲中央銀行將發行一萬元大券事，警備部宣司令鐵吾特令所屬深切注意偵防投機商人乘機淆惑聽聞，原令略稱：査中央銀行行將發行萬元幣券之原因，爲內地籌碼不足，爭向上海匯兌，以致匯率日見增高，而上海各銀行錢莊爲收解便利，要求發行，並經中央銀行鄭重考慮，僉以萬元鈔同値之五百元關金券，早經發行，此次改發萬元幣券，完全爲收解便利，應不影響物價波動，誠恐投機商人乘機淆惑聽聞，盼予深切注意偵防云。</p>
<h3>股票前途揣測多　後市跌風一面倒</h3>
<p>華股昨兎起鶻落，先漲後瀉，除借款消息外，遞交前途忽多不利揣測，臨收竟紛紛慘降至跌停板，僅新光與九福同吿漲停。晨開時即因環境上漸漸不利，人心見怯而低，遞永紗開後，九七號一〇七號六五號一五三號趁賤購納，升至四六一〇元，二二四號一八五號二三一號，二一九號一〇五號七六號一八六號一〇六號博士三號紛加供給，新光新股以九十元上塲後，二〇四號首先掛高至漲停板，惟遞永紗則反降至四四一〇元。一五二號一四號八五號一四五號力購，升爲四四七〇元。三六號一七一號二三五號復賣，　迫低至四三九〇元。一七七號八九號二八號六九號四號一五四號一六〇號咸進，十一時後漸漸拉上，至四五六〇元。二二三號雖賣，一八五號一四五號八九號四號一六〇號二三七號一一二號八二號三六號一二九號一六九號連袂購納，永業由六九號，九福由一二一號，掛高至漲停，於是永紗亦扳高至四七〇〇元，九四號一五四號八四號逢高供售而見盤，近午時傳言遞交有種種不利流言，一時賣風大盛，缺乏維持，七六號六五號一五三號七六三號二二四號二三五號一五四號等爭售之下，遞永紗午收降落至四五〇〇元關，收後散戶急加了結，塲外喊低至四四〇〇元結果較前收計新光漲停，景福漲半成，中法跌一成，美亞微升，永公永紗微降，新華信和跌半成。遞交計景福微升，永紗美亞微挫，信和華豐永公跌半成强，冷股永業九福漲停，內衣升一成，中紡大通商務各升半成光縈，新亞跌一成，餘股榮辱不一。</p>
<p>午後</p>
<p>八六號二一五號八五號來進，遞永紗開後曾升上至四四〇〇元光景。二三五號一五四號一〇五號二一八號一五二號二〇六號奮售，即起賣風，遞永紗跌至四一九〇元。七六號八五號一四五號趁低力購，升爲四個二九〇元。遞美亞統益華豐永公跌停，九七號二〇六號二三一號二八號一五號二二三號二〇號二三一號一六〇號三六號一九九號二二號九一號四號五五號再賣，信和中紡大通新亞亦先跌停，遞永紗跌至四〇一〇元。二八號二一八號一八八號力加維持，曾升爲四一二〇元，一四一號一七二號九一號二〇號二〇三號一二五號九七號一五四號一〇〇〇七號六九號一九九號一四五號再售，臨收遞永紗亦吿跌停。結果較前收計永紗午後毫無成交，祗吿微降，信和美亞華豐永公跌停縈福跌一成强，中法降成半，新華挫二成弱，新光漲停，遞交計永紗美亞華豐永公跌停，信和景福跌成半弱，冷股九福漲停，五和水泥午後無無市，尙形見升，國貨榮豐商務跌一成弱，餘均跌停，塲外各股結果尙形平和。</p>
<h3>新光新股達限度</h3>
<p>昨晨「新光」新股，初次登塲，開盤九十元，不五分鐘，即至一〇八元而吿漲停板。後市塲中雖有各種謠言影響，跌停板者達九隻之多，而「新光」仍屹立未動云。</p>
<h3>統債平穩</h3>
<p>公債昨尙形穩定，初低後高，三三九室四〇八室一一九室四二〇虽有進三一二室五〇三室則出成交六百萬。統丙晨開一三〇〇〇元，低價一二二〇〇元，最後升至一四五〇〇元以上結束。結果較前收計統丁獨跌九百元，甲乙微升，丙漲一千元，戊升五百元。</p>
<h3>外股後市回跌</h3>
<p>外股昨以金匯尙俏，午前有洋行廣帮購買，市况頗堅。午後證券帮力售，終於轉疲。怡紗晨開四二三〇〇元，自四二一〇〇元低價扳高至四五二〇〇元，而後稍回。最後慘跌至四萬元關邊結束。結果較前收計航業鋼業跌一成强，英聯怡啤降落半成光縈，餘股各跌一成光景。</p>
<h3>紡建售出棉紗　無法干涉外銷</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕外傳中國紡建公司，對於運往東北及華北之棉紗申請，均已停止配售，記者曾向該公司某負責人探詢，渠堅決吾認此說。渠稱：紡建公司售紗後，對持紗人是否運往外埠銷售，無法干涉。惟公司因鑒於日來棉紗黑市猖獗，除對四月廿日前，尙未能提供工商登記證之廠號，一律暫停配售外，現有之老配戶中，亦將陸續加以整理。對各廠號之資格，將再予嚴密審査。不合格者，將陸續淘汰云。</p>
<h3>人心堅店胃強　食糧無一不漲　油價狂跳波動最迾</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日南北兩市共到登記米糧九千一百餘石，社會局續拋白粳西貢紅秈九千包，價格不動。惟市塲店　忽然加强，頓成求過於供。　秈元本一致回漲三五千元，雜糧亦相繼上升。良以塲外各種物價猛漲關係，人心激昂，追蹤上升。</p>
<p>麵粉去化亦爽，回升一二千元。麩皮再加二十餘元，豆餅市銷亦頗熟鬧，盤漲二三千元。黄豆油廠進胃濃旺，猛跳三五千元。油市消化亦殷，市勢俏俐，猛烈奔騰一二萬，彼動甚烈。</p>
<p>生仁廣帮暢納，動盪劇烈，狂漲二萬元。芝蔴貨主亦堅，洋莊雖然不動，而本街油廠進取其貪</p>
<h3>榨油原料出口　須繳騐許可證</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕大豆，　花生，芝蔴，菜子，及其榨油之輸出國外，昨日江海關業已公吿，應由商繳騐許可證件，方准放行。該公吿略稱：案奉總稅務司電令，以奉財政部令，行政院決議，爲平衡供求，穩定油價起見，對於大豆，花生，芝蔴，菜子，及其榨油之輸出國外，採取定量許可制度。每季轍出國外，由財政部商同經濟部及輸出推廣委員會規定執行之。仰遵照轉飭各關，對於大豆，花生，芝蔴，菜子，及其榨油之輸出國外，應由商繳騐許可證，方准放行云。</p>
<p>又訊，上星期五江海關通知各報關行，對　糧出口一律禁止，致南洋帮糧食客帮，大起恐慌。昨又據航業界消息，對禁止雜糧出口一節，現江海關正式宣佈，對本國口岸照常可轍出運入，惟運國外者一律禁止，香港亦在內。，暴漲萬元。赤豆華南消路活潑，續見上漲三五千元。紅糧貨稀堅挺，苞米盤旋之局。菉豆香港廣州不動，形趨站局。</p>
<p>股紗昂揚　刺激米價</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日米市　又見波動，社會局拋售米之數量價格仍如前。據悉：米市來源較少，無錫米價回升，至十五萬五千元。昨日本市米價市塲價格爲十六萬五千元，門售達十七萬五千元。菜油價格，回升至四萬五千元，麵粉價格；利朋配售七萬元，黑市達九萬九千元。兵船配售四萬七千元，黑市價六萬八千元。據關係方面稱：日來米價回升，實與發行大票有關，復以股票及紗價之昂揚，刺激一般物價上漲。　昨米市塲間因受國行將發萬元券影響，部份米商顯有拉抬企圖。白粳洋秈俱見回漲，今日社局主管科對南北二市塲，決派員監塌，吉科長親往視察云。</p>
<h3>增加棉紗生產　發展海外市塲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕申新紡織總公司總經理榮鴻元氏昨語記者：爲增加棉紗生產，發展我國棉紗海外市塲計，渠主張：（一）將目前每班工作時間十小時制，延長爲十一小時。使日夜班可開足二十二小時，棉紗產量，當可因此增加。渠稱：職前每班爲十二小時，故日夜班廿四小時，全部開足。故以目前開工時間言，產量不啻已打一八折。（二）望政府能考慮使一部份棉紗外銷，俾便樹立我國在海外之市塲。日本本年度計劃，將以其棉紗產品百分之四十，提供外銷。故如我國棉紗不能及時輸出，則原有市塲，勢將被日紗攘奪以去。矧棉紗出口後，尙能爲國家爭取一筆外匯資金，此對平衡我國國際收支，亦有相當功績云。</p>
<h3>財部令各地行莊</h3>
<p>同業收交亦在禁止之列</p>
<p>財政部爲防止國內資金逃往香港，前經規定旅客由國內前往香港或其他國境之地區，每人携帶本國貨幣，不得超過國幣五十萬元。財部茲爲嚴密管制起見，規定全國各地銀錢行莊應自即日起，停做匯往香港國幣匯款。在未核准恢復以前，全國行莊對於匯往香港國幣匯款，概不得再行承做。又各地行莊間有接受港澳等地同業之委托，辦理收交業務者，自應一併予以禁止。中央銀行奉令後，巳通吿各行莊遷照云。</p>
<h3>食油回漲因原</h3>
<p>本市食油市塲自上週恢復配售後，市價已退至四十一萬以下，與市府規定四十萬元之暫時價格，僅有數千元之上下。日來又漲至四十四五萬元之間，此中原因，仍爲原料問題，未得合理解決。政府允許每月供應一萬五千噸之大豆，因運輸關係，無法濟急。各廠商目前僅賴前次中信局之四千噸大豆，維特現狀。一面法採購原料及食油，供應市塲，並盼政府趕速接濟。靑島油已升至四十萬一祖，與此間限價相衡，亦爲黑市上漲之原因。關於調整配銷機構問題，已由榨油業公會硏究辦法中，將提交社會局召集之會議決定。</p>
<h3>原料缺少結滙困難　皂燭業產量銳减</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據工商輔導處調查：本市皂燭業同業公會會員共四十一家。每月最高產量，計洗衣皂十五萬箱（每箱四七磅），香皂三萬箱（每箱卅磅），甘油五萬磅（以每月出產十萬箱肥皂收回甘油計算），洋燭近未製造。目下因工資太鉅，高利貸壓迫，捐稅繁重，外商在華傾銷甚烈，兼以原料進口及結匯困難，故各廠實際產量，祗及最高產量之半數。如按每月製造洗濯皂十五萬箱計算，則本市皂廠，每月需要原料，計半油四萬市担，泡化碱二千桶（每桶七五〇磅），燒碱一千桶（每桶三百公斤），工業鹽三千市担，純碱（如有燒碱可以不用），煤屑八百噸，椰子油一萬市祖，柴油一千一百噸。上述原料，以燒碱椰子油仰賴舶來品，燒碱國內雖略有生產，但其產量不足，外國燒碱之出口，受政府之限制，不能自由出售，故進口商乘機抬價，每桶價格最高曾達六百餘萬元，而外商祥茂皂廠，則因結匯較易，成本甚輕，本國皂商，無法與其競爭，故該業希望政府予以澈底解決之辦法，俾該業可以轉危爲安。大華泡化碱，產量足供本市之用，但因美貨傾銷，故營業大受影饗。該業目前困難情形有二：（一）燒碱之採購：據該業公會表示：‘燒碱之採購，如覺困難，擬請政府設法轉請永利製碱廠供給純碱，以代燒碱。並請台灘行政長官公署工礦處，儘量供給燒碱，以濟眉急。（二）椰子油之採購：椰子油仰賴南洋方面之供應，該業希望政府准許椰子之結匯，以利椰子油之生產。</p>
<h3>絲綢回疲</h3>
<p>昨市人造絲上午仍形活躍上進，下午利賣空氣傳入市塲，多方乘高出籠，乃呈下挫，結果與上日價軋平。一二零號高山有光開盤二百八十萬元，旋即高喊至三百二十萬元，最大到五十萬元，但因價過高而買戶却步，故仍退做三百念萬元收盤。下午因傳借款有着，股票下跌，於是人心漸虛，有賣無買，最後退做二百五十萬元收盤。廠經上午人心頗振舊，Ｄ字等級四百萬元有成交，普通另據高檔亦喊一千四百萬元，干經另　討價一千萬元，五　有單子貸一千一百元，下午因人造絲回跌，亦跟隨帶軟，喊價各檔均小二三十萬元不等。綢貨連朝高升，昨市除大誠格子璧縐晨開二萬五千二百元成交，最後五千六百元，比上日大六百元外，其餘均堅穩，無甚進展。</p>
<h3>棉布市塲交易　僅有花色布</h3>
<p>棉布市塲昨日雖有交易，惟大都爲各種花色布疋，蓋該項貨品不在限價之內，與經濟檢査揹施規定之種類，並無抵觸，故公會方面准許同業在塲交易。至各種繁銷貨品，如龍頭細布，四君子嗶嘰等，則連日因黑市紗價暴漲，刺激棉布成本，人心與常振奮，成交價格，已遠超過法定限價，公會方面爲遵守當局平價意旨，對此項違法買變，仍不許在塲內交易，惟據該會秘書印心源稱：邇來黑市棉紗價格暴漲，繁銷布疋，均以二十支紗爲原料加工複製，一磅紗織一磅布，外加加工複製工繳等，依照近日黑市紗價計算，棉布成本實已超過法定限價，該公會擬召集同業會議，商討善後辦法云。</p>
<h3>稱定猪肉價格　設法予以貸款</h3>
<p>社局召集代表談話</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局昨日下午三時召集猪肉業，猪行業，牛羊業等代表，舉行鮮肉評議限價委員會，其談話要點：（一）爲穩定猪肉價格，可設法予以低利貸款，範圍應以普遍爲原則。（二）由猪行鮮肉兩同業公會，於五日內造具貸款計劃書，以憑核轉金融機關。（三）貸款成立後，所有採辦分配情形，以及議定之價格，均應呈報主管機關隨時査核。</p>
<h3>烟煤屑回降</h3>
<p>烟煤初承前日漲勢，行市步步喊高，開平一號屑曾出百萬元大關，嗣因喊便過高，賣戶見衆，進戶反呈觀望，市勢突轉呆滯，行市迅速回降，惟結果較前市尙升，白煤來貨微細，市價愈盤愈高，焦作塊已達一百七十五萬元新價，江西四方子白煤汕頭梅園白煤等，亦需一百四五十萬元。焦炭亦因烟煤屑暴漲，影響市况，一致挺秀。</p>
<h3>大批茶葉運歐</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕法國郵船公司租賃之丹輪柯立斯麥司古號，昨午自滬駛法，除原船由秦皇島載大豆八千噸來滬，又加裝茶葉一萬零三百餘箱，運往法國。</p>
<h3>內銷不振</h3>
<p>徘徊已久之各種內銷茶，賣戶雖漸萌高扳之念，惟終因實銷動而不力，故市面仍難奮起，結果續呈盤檔局面。杭州新龍井邇來到源依然不絕，惟品質日趨蒼老，致同業互做價，傾向下游，然人心不餒，過程明跌暗平。洋莊茶市：在裕泰對於去年度浮梁紅茶賡續扒取，其他花色祗僅零星做開，形勢均極極平疲。</p>
<h3>進口額少需要殷切　白報約迭見挺長　廣州方面亦向滬市吸購</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據業中人談：白報紙步漲之近因，不外：（二）進口限額太少（二）外埠需要殷切，（三）黑市美匯高漲。故日來價格又見挺升。捲筒白報紙，每磅價達三千元。切開白報紙，每令已達十五萬五千元。</p>
<p>白報紙本年二月至四月之進口限額，除報業分配美金七十二萬元，書業分配六十四萬二千元外，剩餘限額美金二十二萬元，由紙類進口商行十八家互分。最大型者分得七萬餘元，最小型者分得五千元。另有其他紙類限額美金卅六萬四千元，則分由七十四家進口商行分配。最大型者分得四萬元，最小型者僅得千元，可見分得限額之小。至外帮之採辦，仍北帮去路最大。惟聞近來廣州方面輸管會發給許可證，亦趨嚴格，故漢口及粤漢路一帶，原向香港方而獲須紙類來源者，亦將轉向滬市吸購云。</p>

<h3>娘子軍在編練中　山東婦女運動的新光輝</h3>
<p>— 濟南十六日航訊　本報特派員麗天</p>
<p>由於勝利以來，山東十分之八以上的土地始終在中共盤據「解放」之下，所僅剩的地方也始終在共軍「硬打軟吃」之中。這裏不難看出山東局勢的主持者的苦辛。</p>
<p>爲了應付山東嚴重局勢，不僅是政府和山東男兒的責任，同時，三齊婦女不甘落後，在魯婦運會楊寳琳胡浥塵等倡導和力行下，首對「天下與亡，匹夫有責，匹婦亦有責」有了光榮的成就，而一洗歷來加予婦女的「商女不知亡國恨」的恥辱。這在中國婦運史上堪稱創舉，値得全國各省市婦女工作者效法的是魯婦運會對山東婦女的訓練工作。</p>
<p>魯婦運會　不甘落後</p>
<p>當去年今日，山東受停戰協定影響，政府的部隊一律不准北上，而原在濟南的國軍兵力又單薄到不堪想像時，王耀武早對民衆自衛力量有所重視而有人民自衛總隊的組織，首先將省垣人民於三個月內訓練了二十六萬七千九百七十三人，魯婦運會不甘落後，自動協同人民自衛總隊部組設婦女組，也訓練了三萬三千名娘子軍。</p>
<p>訓練的辦法是將省垣婦女，凡年在十八歲至三十五歲之間者，均分別編隊受訓·一般婦女，包括女店員，女理髮匠，女招待等，皆以區坊保爲單位，分別編爲支隊，大隊及中隊。至於坤伶歌女，妓女等，則由總隊部編爲直屬大隊訓練之工廠女工與女職員及各機關學校之女公敎人員，女學生等，則就原機關學校自行編訓，由總隊部婦女組派員指導敎練。訓練的科目，除軍事科目外，尤重政治訓練，並遍及看護，救護，育兒，縫紉，淸潔，調査，組訓，宣傳等。爲了减少調訓時實際上的困難，規定了：（一）凡有三歲以下子女而無他人照料者，（二）有病或當纏足行動不便者，（三）產婦或受孕在五個月以上者，（四）獨負家庭責任之家庭主婦而不能離開家庭者，一律免予受訓。</p>
<p>偉大行列　氣宇宙軒昂</p>
<p>在婦女普訓前，爲了便於訓練的進行，首將報到應受訓婦女中擇其授有初中或師範以上敎育之婦女五三七名，先施以短期的幹部訓練，然後再將這批幹部分配到各區坊保進行普遍鄉婦女訓練，在受訓期間，雖然由於一部市民思想落伍反對婦訓，加以共黨趁機造謠，謂「婦女訓練是備慰勞作戰將土」之用，致有少數婦</p>
<p>女難免逃匿觀望，但極大多數的婦女都能踴躍參加，虛心受敎，並要求受訓後參加調查，宣傳，慰勞等工作。十日訓練完畢後，於南圩門外省立體育塲舉行校閱時三萬六千員步武整齊，精神煥發，雄赳赳氣昂昂的娘子軍所編成的偉大行列，不僅在全國婦運聲中放一異彩，即在省垣整個人民自衛訓練中，其成績之優異，亦有足多者。當大隊行列行經牧閱台前，敎育長楊寳琳領導高呼「錯女解放萬歲」時，三萬六千人齊聲喊動，聲震魯漢，即濟郊千佛名山，亦如響斯應。</p>
<p>校閱的結果，以各工廠學校及鐵路局成續爲最佳，各機關職員成績爲最劣，而出人意外値得注意的倒是妓女大隊的成績竟居總評第二位，據調査，因爲她們最富有服從性和進取心，所以她們能有這樣高的成就。</p>
<p>這種婦女訓練的機構現在仍然保持着，並進而將原有的十一個支隊九個直屬大隊分爲宣傳，組訓，調査，救護，慰勞專五組，每”召集與訓人員兩次。前些時舉行的春季大會操，這些中蘿的女兒們較去年　受訓時已直顯著的進步。無疑的，她們的成長，給這萬雨膩搖的山東大局，尤其過去的孤城濟甫，帶來了不少不可磨滅的安定力。</p>
<p>除此以外，魯婦運會另外兩件偉大的成就是：（一）山東烈士遺族學校的創設，截至最近，已收容抗戰殉難烈士子弟六百餘名，分設小學六班，高初中五班，所有學生　宿服裝書籍各費均由學校負担。（二）慰勞工作的推進：即就上月初濟南緊急時半個月內，就已完成了十億元及廿萬雙鞋襪的募捐運動。</p>
<p>其他如婦女識字班，錦女診撩所，婦女合作社，婦女福利服務社，佐民托兒所，思源幼稚園，以及對於一切被壓迫婦女之救濟，調解被壓迫婦女及其家庭糾紛等都在如火如荼地展開着，並都已各有其顯著的成績，足炎效人觀摩，亦足資她人效法。在山東截至目前爲止，你能找到任何一個社國，能再比婦運會更活躍的嗎？在工作上更有所表現的嗎？無疑的，山東婦女不僅正埋頭於以行動米爭取自身的解放，同時亦正以行動來造福於國家人羣。</p>

<h3>德人新發明　苦栗救苦　滿街搖錢樹　衣食俱溫飽</h3>
<p>— 六日航訊　本報特約者　往仁寄自萊汀</p>
<p>德國去年經悠久之嚴冬，啼飢號寒，苦到極點，而德國學者，競憑科學萬能之力，廢物利用，巧奪天功，別闢一妙解，是即「苦栗救苦」之最新發明。</p>
<p>其法乃從經秋散棄滿街無用處，囊狀殼斗全面生蝟毛之苦栗，取得原料，以裕民生，不僅喫得，並且著得，一種用以壯示容之街道裝飾樹，今忽樊爲靠彼得衣兼得食之搖錢樹矣。</p>
<p>栗爲山野自生之落葉喬木，高達五丈餘，葉互生尖長若披針，葉邊有尖銳鋸齒，西歐五月雄花雌花伺時開，雄花作長穗狀之排列，雌花常三花集生，花色近黄之白，紅者尤美，花開承以葉，遠望若萬枝紅燭。谿隩山市一庭院，可以代表德地穠春之美，不减中國之桃與日本之櫻。</p>
<p>考歐洲大陸之栗，分甜與苦之兩種，甜者英名甜栗SweetChestnut，法名野栗Marron。中國西湖桂花栗，成爲食中珍品，乃甜栗。法國南方之蜜潰甜栗，馳名全世界，吾華大可仿行。苦者臘丁英法等名，單稱栗，Chestnut味苦不可食，或用以飼馬，華名當作「苦栗」，示有別於甜栗。</p>
<p>予於三十六歲之生辰，挈伴春遊，即景成詠，中有一詩，深足以見德地方春之樂，追錄如下：行歌鼓瑟去匆匆，小隊遊禽覿面風。（德名遊禽　，指擅音歌之野外男女童軍，仙樂風飄，春光莫負少年時，令人神往）。野店咖啡人滿坐，綠陰庭院栗花紅」。（此栗即苦栗也）。</p>
<p>今德國學者發見『苦栗』所含滋養料，尙比我華科學泰斗李高陽（石曾）努力倡導之大豆食品爲更　　，（一）栗乾磨粉，除苦味，可成質甚良之上白麵粉。（二）可製牛乳替代品，將以媲美中國之豆腐漿，其尤美者，爲自苦栗去苦味，以製冰琪琳。（三）取材於苦栗之人造羊毛可禁寒。（四個）可提製治腸姐之聖藥。</p>

<p>莎士比亞雖然是英國人，可是在文學上，尤其在戲劇方面，他已經是屬於全人類了。偉大的藝人總是如此的，因為他們所處理的對象，不是某一國人，某一時代的人，而是人類的整體，人性的本質；不但越超空間，而且也越過時間。在這次大戰期間，美國盛演着莎氏的戲，不但如此，前綫上的軍人劇團，也有過好幾次莎劇的演出；民主的黑種劇人羅布遜更在勞軍義演裏，實在是最適當不過了。</p>
<p>蘇聯對於莎士比亞的熱忱，實沒有第二個國家可與它比並。蘇聯全國各地的劇院，每年春天都大規模的上演莎氏的作品；看過莎氏作品的蘇聯人民，根據譯本的銷數來統計，至少也是以百萬計了。這不僅是因為蘇聯人民崇敬莎士比亞，也足以證明了他們人民的文藝修養上的造詣。</p>
<p>我們早就習慣於聽讀讚美莎士比亞的言語及文字了。他的警語，他所創造的典型，也在幾百年來不斷的被人引用着。我對於莎士比亞的評價人一向主張採取批判的態度，不過因為他的作品多，他所處理的範圍廣，討論他的文字又真可當得起汗牛而充棟，所以我雖然從事他作品的迻譯有十五六年，而對於他的批評之作，還始終不敢動手。</p>
<p>在英國今日，莎士比亞的研究也被學者視為畏途。研究的人雖不在少，專著的出版即使在戰時，每年也都還有幾本，可是能集大成的學人，及湛深精到之作，卻已十餘年來不一見了。</p>
<p>然而英國人對於莎士比亞卻是沒有忘情報，倫敦的舞台每年都重複的演着莎氏的戲，此外每年一度的就在莎士比亞誕辰的前後，莎氏故鄉的紀念劇院還有一次盛大的莎氏作品的演出。今年的四月二十三日是莎士比亞誕生的第三百八十三週年紀念，也是他逝世的第三百三十一週年忌，想此時英國，在亞翁河畔，莎氏的故鄉鎮上，必定又是熱鬧非凡了。</p>
<p>在我的手邊上有一張一九三八年莎劇演出節的秩序單字。那一個戲劇節的規模，可算是相當大的。它從四月三日開始，到九月二十三日才閉幕。在此期間足足演出二十五個禮拜的莎翁作品。對於研究莎士比亞的人們，祇需要參加一次這種戲劇節，就可以獲益不淺了。我那一年雖然在英國，可是因為沒有錢，未能去看戲，到如今每想起來，還是引為恨事的。</p>
<p>那一次演出分前後兩部，前部佔時十二週，共演出八個戲：</p>
<p>一·如願　十三次</p>
<p>二·第十二夜　十二次</p>
<p>三·奧塞羅　十四次</p>
<p>四·馴悍婦　十三次</p>
<p>五·李查王三世　十三次</p>
<p>六·錯中錯　十一次</p>
<p>七·無事忙　十一次</p>
<p>八·寇里奧蘭諾斯　九次</p>
<p>總共是九十六次每週六天—星期日停演—平均演八場。後部節目上也是八個戲，包括「威尼斯商人」，「漢姆萊特」等在英國有幾個著名演員是專門演莎士比亞的戲的。他們就住在斯特拉福鎮附近，每年也祇是在這個節期裏參加演出。</p>
<p>這種的觀眾可以說是來自世界各處。英國的觀眾，除了學生之外，反而不佔重要地位，在斯特拉福鎮上，莎士比亞紀念劇場乃是全鎮的中心，來遊覧的外國人，仰慕莎士比亞的人們，終年都絡繹不絕。到了戲劇節期內更是遊人眾多。鐵路公司加開專車，長途公共汽車增開班次，一切都是為了看莎士比亞的戲。</p>
<p>莎士比亞一生共寫了三十七個劇本，另外有一本十四行詩，同幾次長詩，在這三十七個劇本裏，有幾個是極難得演出的，如「李耳王」乃是個很難演的戲，平常兩三年也不見得有人上演一次；在喜劇方面，「暴風雨」也是不大有人肯演的。</p>
<p>雖然如此，他的另外一些戲卻不但常常演出，而且還被觀眾熱烈的欣賞着，幾百年來如一日，「如願」，「威尼斯商人」，「漢姆萊特」，「仲夏夜之夢」，「奧塞羅」，「羅米歐及朱麗葉」等都是每年復活在歐美舞台上的劇本。</p>
<p>在英語民族裏，莎士比亞的作品還被當做劇人的一種考騐，他們的學童必需讀些莎士比亞是不用說了，因為他是最佳的作者；此外他們的青年如果想從事演劇的工作，扮演莎氏作品中的一個角色，也是必經的階段。莎劇裏有幾個角色，男的如「威尼斯商人」裏的猶太人賽洛克，李查王三世，羅米歐，漢姆萊特；女的如朱麗葉，馬克白斯夫人，「如願」裏的羅莎　，都是一個成功的演員所必需刻劃的人物。</p>
<p>我不知道到哪一天，才能夠把莎士比亞直正的面目介紹到中國的舞台上來，給中國的觀眾看。改編絕不是正路；從好萊塢攝製的電影上學習也不是辦法。好萊塢的莎劇電影我看見過好幾個：「鑄情」（羅米歐及朱麗葉），「如願」，「仲夏夜之夢」，「馴悍婦」及「亨利王五世」，這些祇有亨利王好些，其它都太美國化了，可是不幸，亨利王這個劇本，中國人對它太不容易歡喜了。</p>
<p>我認為莎士比亞來的劇本，在中國上演是有成功可能的。我的譯本是為了學生們讀的，若是為了上演，可以改成口語，但願國內局勢能夠安定，文學的活動能夠再熱鬧起來。那樣，我們或者也可以來介紹一次莎士比亞，演一次「漢姆萊特」。</p>
<h3>莎士比亞</h3>
<p>— 家驊</p>
<p>莎士比亞是世界最偉大的劇作家，他雖是十六世紀依利莎白時代的人物，因為他有不少光輝的巨著遺留給我們，所以相距三百餘年的現在，在世界文學史上，他仍是一朵鮮艷的蓓蕾。</p>
<p>文學批評索洛里哀說：「我們一聽見莎士比亞，已得着一種壯偉的觀念」（比較文學史）。威爾遜，耐特教授也這樣讚詠：「威廉·莎士比亞，在世界文學史上，實是一位最偉大的作家」。</p>
<h3>莎翁像</h3>

<h3>莎士比亞的作品</h3>
<p>— 灃莉</p>
<p>莎士比亞曾寫過三十六個劇本，當時，他的劇本並未刊印供讀者閱讀，那些劇本祇在舞台上演出。在莎氏逝世時，有二十一個劇本的草稿在各戲院中發現。其他的，有一小部份已印成四開書本（Quarto　form），這是得到莎氏的許可而印的。大部份的劇本是聽眾在劇院中速記下來的，有些出版家為了他自己的利益而偷印。第一次刊行的莎氏劇本全集稱為最早的對摺本（First　Folio），那是兩位伶人希明（Heming）和康地克（Condell）</p>
<p>莎氏的劇本依着他生活的進展和騐，可分為五個時期。</p>
<p>（一）初期的試驗時期</p>
<p>初期的作品表現着青年而富於想像。</p>
<p>莎氏開始她的寫作最初是模仿舊的劇本寫了「亨利第六」（Henryvi）以後他模仿瑪洛（Marlowe）的作風寫成（Titus　Andronicus），模仿寫成「戀愛事業損失」（Love's　Ladbur's　Lost）。模仿拉丁喜劇，柏蘭特斯（Mantus）的Mcnaechmi寫成「錯誤的喜劇」（Comedy　or　Errors）。莎氏第一期的代表作是「維羅納之兩紳士」（Two　Gentlemen　of　verona），「仲夏夜之夢」（A　Midsummer　Night's　Deram），「羅蜜歐與朱麗葉」（Romeo　and　Juliet）。在這些劇本中，我們看出莎氏的寫作有迅速的進展。</p>
<p>（二）英國歷史劇本時期</p>
<p>三十歲以後，莎氏開始寫歷史劇本：「李卻第三」（RichardⅢ）「李卻第二」（RichardⅡ）「約翰王」（King　John）「亨利第四」（Henry　Ⅳ）,「亨利第五」（Henry　Ⅴ）。這些劇本中的歷史材料和裨史，多半採取於荷林希德（Holished）的「英蘇愛編年史」（Chronicles　ofEndland　Scothland,and　Iteland）。這期間莎氏也曾為一點喜劇的浮彫。如「福斯達夫」（Folstaff）。</p>
<p>（三）「威尼斯商人」和愉快喜劇時期</p>
<p>這期的劇本是：「馴悍記」（Taming　of　the　Shrew），「溫沙的嬌妻」（Merry　Wives　of　Windsor），「威尼斯商人」（The　Merchant　of　venice），「如願」（As　you　Likc　It）。寫完「威尼斯商人」以後，莎氏改變作風，他的作品變成嚴肅而憂鬱。「第十二夜」（Twelfth　Night）是莎氏喜劇的最後一部。莎氏曾為十四行詩（Sonnet）。他的十四行詩是在一六〇九年出版。</p>
<p>（四）憂鬱時期</p>
<p>莎氏寫羅馬劇本：「凱撒大將」（Julius　Caesar），「哥利蘭斯」（Coriolanus），「安東尼和古羅巴」（Antony　and　Cleopatra）。完成羅馬劇本以後，莎氏又開始寫喜劇，但是他寫的是苦的喜劇，例如：「韻律之韻律」（Meaure　for　Measure），「特路斯和克利西達」（Troilus　and　Cressida），以後莎氏寫了四個大悲劇：「哈孟雷特」（Hamlet），「奧賽羅」（Othello），「麥克白」（Macbeth），「李爾王」（King　Lear）。最後一部悲劇是「雅典的提摩」（Timon　of　Athens），以後莎氏不再寫悲劇。</p>
<p>（五）純正浪漫時期</p>
<p>這時期的劇本充滿着奧妙泰然的精神，表現着莎氏晚年的文學作品。「新白林」Cymbeline,「冬季的故事」（Winte's　Tale），「暴風雨」（Tempest）是他晚年最好的劇本。暴風雨是為一六一三年依麗沙白公主和伯拉丁親王的婚禮所寫的。暴風雨表現着莎氏新的性格。「仲夏夜之夢」的嫵媚，「羅蜜歐與朱麗葉」的熱情，「福斯達夫」的詼諧，「李爾王」的浩氣，各種優點齊集在「暴風雨」中，這是莎氏最後的藝術作品。</p>
<h3>莎士比亞　十四行詩　第一百零九首</h3>
<p>— 真勤試譯</p>
<p>哦，請你無論如何不要說我負心，</p>
<p>雖然別離像是減低了我底熱情。</p>
<p>我離不了在你胸中的我底靈魂，</p>
<p>正如我也離不了我自己底肉身。</p>
<p>你底胸膛是我愛情底家：我已經</p>
<p>如旅人般流浪過，現在重回家門；</p>
<p>凖時而到，也不曾隨時光而移情，——</p>
<p>好比自己帶水來洗自己底汚　。</p>
<p>雖然我底性情中含有一切人類</p>
<p>都有的弱點，可千萬別相信我會</p>
<p>荒謬地把性情弄得如此的汚穢，</p>
<p>竟不為什麼拋開你一切的美。</p>
<p>這廣大的宇宙是個虛無，我認為，</p>
<p>其中唯你是我底一切，我底玫瑰！</p>
<h3>猶疑的悲劇</h3>
<p>— 閻哲吾</p>
<p>——To　be　or　not　to　beyThat's　question</p>
<p>這是莎士比亞的名著「哈孟雷特」裏有名的獨白，明確地代表時代苦悶的遲疑的青年們之心情，形成了一個慘慘的性格的悲劇！那段有名的台詞大意是：</p>
<p>「是活着的好呢？還是不活着的好呢？——這是一個問題。</p>
<p>怎樣才算是個英雄好漢？究竟是應該忍受強暴的命運呢？還是應該拔出劍來和那滔天的恨事拼命相鬥，死而後已呢？</p>
<p>死就是長眠；若是閉眼長眠就能解脫我們心頭的悲痛和肉體的苦惱—那眞是我們求之不得的好事。</p>
<p>死—也等於睡！—睡，也許做夢！　，障碍就在這兒啦！我們捐棄塵世之後，在死睡當中會做些什麼夢呢？這不能不使我們有所躊躇。</p>
<p>這苦惱的生活，一直讓他茍延殘喘，也就是這個關係；不然，短劍一揮，誰不能了結他自己的性命？誰還甘心忍受這時代的鞭撻，笑罵；高太遠者的橫暴，榨取者的欺凌，失戀的悲哀，法律的拖延，官吏的傲慢，以及小人的嫉妒呢？</p>
<p>死，是旅客一去不返的未經發見的異鄉，若不是有死後的恐懼，令人心志迷惑，使得我們寗可忍受現世的悲痛而不敢輕易嘗試那不可知的異鄉的苦惱，誰還願意措着重担在這厭倦的人生底下呻吟，喘息？</p>
<p>所以我們的良心把一切人類都變成了懦夫，所以敢作敢為的血性被思前想後的慮害得變成了灰色！驚天動地的事業也往往因此而中途改道，壯志全消啦！……」</p>
<p>從哈孟特「思前想後」的美麗台詞裏我們透視到一種人生的苦悶，社會的苦悶，時代的苦悶，因而才產生了性格的悲劇！這悲劇自有其產生的背景，但這十六世紀的苦悶思想仍然縈迴於目前時代的人們腦海中！</p>
<p>幹呢？不幹呢？升天堂嗎？入地獄嗎？積極乎？消極乎？道義乎？利害乎？苦行乎？享受乎？清高乎？簡俗乎？守舊乎？立新乎？——活呢？死呢？……這些　不定的思潮時時衝擊着神經，人們在這轉形的時代裏也產生了猶疑不定的性格。尤其是知識份子，浸沒入「哈孟雷特型」的特別的多！</p>
<p>在英國，莎士比亞所接觸的時代是猶權制度沒落，貴族階級變質，王政統治權力擴張，商業資本主義興起，一切舊的觀點已經坍毀，新的道德還未建立，一個激變中的過渡時期。因此，人們生活信念也在動搖，懷疑，猶豫的不果斷狀態中，苦悶，感嘆，乃至發生失望的悲哀。</p>
<p>在中國，我們所接觸的目前時代，社會，人生，正如莎士比亞在當時英國一半，也正如他心中所想，筆下所述。一切均在苦悶中！唯其執有新的憧憬，而又殘留有　的遺念，因此，造成「做好人做不到頭，做壞人也做不到底」的性格悲劇，我們卻往往做了這悲劇的主人公。</p>
<p>「思前想後」固然顧慮週到，但遇事千慮，反有一失，有為的人們，處這變亂的社會應取「果敢」的態度，認清真理，不必隨俗浮沈？堅定意志，無妨孤行已意。否則鑒往思今，不出莎士比亞的筆底，徒多幾個哈孟雷特，多演變齣性格的悲劇而已！</p>
<p>紀念莎士比亞的生辰，我想起了那千古不朽的名句。而由過渡時代的苦悶更警惕到自己別也陷入到「猶疑」的深淵，應昂揚起奮鬥堅定的帆幟，航行於那過渡時期新舊脫節的狂瀾之中！</p>
<h3>今年英國的莎翁戲劇節</h3>
<p>— 英·特洛維克</p>
<p>莎士比亞戲劇節的負責人傑克遜最近宣佈了一九四七年莎翁的各種計劃。</p>
<p>今年這兩個佳節將支持到廿五個星期，可算是一八七九年成立這個以來最出色的一個。</p>
<p>本屆參加演出的演員五十人，由比特勒克斯，李曼和勞勃脫，海立斯領銜主演。要演出的劇本計有九個，八個是莎士比亞劇本，第九個是馬樂衛的「費烏斯特博士。」</p>
<p>莎翁戲劇節自四月五日開幕，首先演出的是「羅蜜歐與朱麗葉」，由勞倫斯，潘尼扮羅蜜歐苔芬，斯萊特扮朱麗葉，比勒克斯。李曼扮保姆。</p>
<p>這次的演出是很令人注意的，因為傑克遜根據他的大胆的經騐，把劇務委托了年僅廿一歲彼得布魯克。</p>
<p>為慶祝莎士比亞在四月二十三日誕辰，將上演「第十二夜」。紀念儀式將在中午舉行「萬國旗」式。到了正午就吹號筒，立刻有四十國的國族由他們的代表展開來。</p>
<p>今天可望有許多的大使和大官參加，排了隊到莎士比亞的出生地以及他的墓地那裏去。其後是舉行公共宴會，由皇家學會會長摩寗爵士主持。</p>
<p>今年其他要演的莎士比亞的劇本，有「求愛不成」，「暴風雨」，「理查第二」，「威尼斯商人」以及看到的「泰萊王子」。</p>
<p>今年這個戲劇節的另一特色，是一連串的公開演講，這是莎士比亞紀念劇院的保管者和英國克化委員會主持的。這些演講者將批評一個星期間所看到上演的戲劇。</p>
<p>所有研究莎士比亞的學者，也將於四月十七到二十七四日期間舉行一次國際性的會議。（英國新聞處特稿）</p>
<h3>莎翁生活</h3>
<p>— 徐心芹</p>
<p>莎翁的畢生生活，真是淡泊以明志，寗靜以致遠。他決不標榜門戶之見，他的才能雖然是多方面的，然而他不慕榮利，漠視權益。終身以貢獻文化事業為職志。田舍翁之子，仍以田舍翁自居。他的史劇，幾乎可以使全世界當作英國的信史來讀，但他所暴露的宮　罪惡，政治陰謀，並不是偏頗好惡，宣傳毀謗。他純粹站在愛護國家民族的立場，以熱烈的情緒，藝術的技巧在舊筆疾書，作春秋的藵貶。在這裏使我們看出，偉大房屋的藝術，才真是千古不朽！</p>
<h3>莎士比亞底十四詩</h3>
<p>— 真勤</p>
<p>不要輕視十四行詩；批評家呵…………莎士比亞把它當作鑰匙，開啓了他底心扉……</p>
<p>——華茲華斯：十四行詩</p>
<p>沙士比亞（Shakespeare）生於一五六四年，死於一六一六年）是英國伊利沙白女王時代底大文豪，也可說是古今最偉大的戲曲家。但他底價值，要到十九世紀才被世界真正認識，先後經由德國萊辛（Lessing）和英國底柯立其（Colerrdge）底闡揚光大，沙士比亞在文學的地位才成為至高無上峯頂。在十七世紀，密爾頓（Milton）不過這樣稱沙士比亞：</p>
<p>……最甜蜜的沙士比亞，幻想底孩子。</p>
<p>啘囀地唱着他家鄉山野的林木之歌，</p>
<p>——密爾頓：快活的人然而到了十九世紀中華，阿諾德（Arnold）已經這樣喊了：</p>
<p>……你微笑而無言，超過了峯頂的智慧呵。……</p>
<p>——阿諾德：沙士比亞</p>
<p>不過，沙氏底戲曲在十九世紀以前還有人注意，不時上演，而他底十四行詩集，卻非到十九世紀就根本不曾有人留心過。一旦有人注意之後，大家才發現了這詩集之非常的美，承認沙士比亞在抒情詩底發展史上跟他在戲曲底發展史上佔着同樣崇高的地位。</p>
<p>這十四行詩集之所以成為藝林之珍，不單因為它們是精美的藝術品，還因為它們述說了沙士比亞底心曲，作為古今第一大文豪的沙士比亞，留給我們一個空白的個人歷史；我們可以熟悉十九世紀一個第三流文人底傳記比沙氏底詳細百倍，這是歷史底冷酷的遊戲。但幸而我們有了這可貴的十四行詩集，從這裏，我們約略知道了沙氏生平一段重要事蹟。集中共十四行詩一百五十二首，約可分為兩系，第一系從第一至第一百二十六首，是向一個美少年的愛的傾訴，有連續性，委婉曲折，凄切動人；第二系自第一百二十七至第一百五十二首，是向一個黑眼黑髪的『黑姑娘』所發，訴說了熱烈瘋狂的愛情。有人說這些詩不過是沙氏假自己之筆說他人之情罷了，正如他戲曲裏劇中人底對白一樣，但是這種論客之不能深入作品內蘊的精神，徒作浮面斷語，實令人不解之至。這些詩之並非故意經之營之的故事而為詩人底不自覺的真實的自白，實是很明顯的事。然而數百年來，批評家們與考據家們爭相解釋這些詩底背境，譬如那美少年究竟是誰，沙氏與他是否是同性愛人等等，倒煞是好看的景象，只是與這些詩本身底價值並沒有影響罷了。</p>
<p>十四行詩底形式是在十六世紀初葉由懷德（Wy　　　）和修瑞（Surrey）介紹到英國來的。其節奏是抑楊楊格（Lambus），每行五個音脚（foot），所以是五步音詩（Pentameter），全詩共十四行，而讀脚規則，意大利原來的形式譬如彼得拉克（Peharch）所用的是這樣的：</p>
<p>abba　abba　cdc　dcd</p>
<p>懷德和修瑞底十四行詩就常常有變化，而沙士比亞底十四行詩是一律的：</p>
<p>abab　cdcd　efef　gg</p>
<p>後來凡依這種韻脚規則寫成的十四行詩稱作沙士比亞或英國式，因為它與古典式即彼德拉克底意大利式不同，也與沙氏同時的英國其他詩人所寫的不同，如斯本塞（Spenser）有斯本塞式的十四行詩。但是沙氏這種韻脚規則並不是他創造的，修瑞早就用過，而且最早的十四行詩作者也是用這種形式的。</p>
<p>所謂十四行詩，普通英文呌作Sonnet，讀如「宋納特」，所以有人音譯為「商籟體」，但英文也可以呌作Sonata,名稱和音樂中的鳴奏曲或「鎖那台」相同。它原是預備寫出來歌唱用的，所以可以算作是抒情詩底一種；但手法卻又有些戲劇性：在開始的四行中介紹概念，在第二和第三個四行中抑揚頓挫，迴旋糾結，在最後的偶句中作明朗或截然的結束。十四行詩在英國詩歌中佔着很重要的地位，雖然它是一種外來的詩體。懷德和修瑞是介紹者，沙士比亞是完成者，他如斯本塞，密爾頓，十九世紀底華茲華斯（Wordsworth），濟慈（Keats），白朗寗夫人（E.B.Browning）及近代的曼殊斐爾特（Mascfield）等都由詩崛起之後，才少見了十四行詩。</p>
<p>我國介紹沙氏十四行詩的人，似乎很少。我以寡聞，只知道三位：梁過春先生底英漢對照的「英國詩歌選」中國散文譯了六首，梁宗岱先生譯過若干首，曾發表在戰前朱光潛先生編的「文學雜誌」上，和戰時時事新報的學燈上，此外就只有最近出版的李岳南先生底譯詩集「小夜曲」上的一首了，但幸而這一乎算是沒有譯錯。近曹未風先生譯沙士比亞全集，已出多本戲曲，而十四行詩集亦列為全集之一，惟至今尙未見出版，不免令讀者心焦。我素愛沙氏十四行詩，又得友人之贈，獲斯托丕斯女士（Stopes）註釋並附有長序之沙氏十四行詩集版本，暇難翻閱。病中無事，亦曾偶譯數首。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>小學教師跳樓</h3>
<p>— 月鳳</p>
<p>報載前晚有一位小學教師名俞靜山的跳樓自殺了。稱小學教師跳樓其實是錯誤的，因為跳樓的時候他已經不是一個教師，而是某服裝公司的一個公役。可是新聞記者卻要強調他以前曾經充任小學教師，要說出他所遺下的兩封絕命書，文筆頗為清秀云云。</p>
<p>自殺的原因是收入微細，難以養家。可知他雖然文筆清秀，而且曾為人師，對於他的收入卻並無幫助。恐怕非但沒有幫助，而且有些妨礙。做久了教師的人，總有點清高牌氣，不曾鑒貌辨色，更不肯侍候他人，他祇會拿每月固定的薪水，不指望什麼厚賞和外快。於是這位以小教而改業工役的青年人，收入就無法增多而難以瞻養家庭了。於是他不免因氣憤而自動結束了他的生命。</p>
<p>毛病就出在他這點氣憤，正如報紙的標題上說他「淪」為工役一樣，他大概感到這次改業是有失身分的事。降低了身分而仍舊不能謀家的人一飽，自不免有憤激的感觸。他想錯了。</p>
<p>「長衫勿脫，祖宗積德，」這是民經過去的封建思想。穿了長衫為什麼比穿短打的人就高了一等呢？這在現代社會中是沒有理由可說的。不幸我們這班穿長衫的人，卻擺脫不了這種思想，永遠在勞心在這邊不要動手。不少人穿着長衫死也不肯脫下，在精神上他們也算是勝利的。糟糕的是多數人旣有鴻溝，卻又被逼着要跨過鴻溝到對岸去，在跳的時候，缺乏勇往直前的勇氣，脚步向前，頭卻回顧着背後，如此而落空掉在河裏，才是奇蹟。</p>
<h3>人口過剩</h3>
<p>— 夢平</p>
<p>提起中國人口數字，無論何人都會不知思索的回答四億五千萬人，究竟在四億抑是四億五千萬，或是四億七千萬，因無確切統計，誰也不能作有肯定的答復。</p>
<p>東華錄載西曆一七四一年（乾隆六年）中國人口為一億四千三百四十一萬人；至一八四一年（道光二十一年）為四億一千三百四十五萬人；一八七三年（同治十二年）為四億七千七百十三萬人；自一七四一至一八四一年相隔一世紀，人口增加二億七千萬，即約增加三倍。據此推測，自民國元年至三十六年，雖然有八年的抗戰與連年的內亂，死亡載道，但人口有增無減，是可斷言。</p>
<p>日本藤原定氏論稿，「清末人口過剩諸現現象與太平天國運動」中載耕地增加率，西曆一七二四年（雍正二年）假定為一〇〇，至一八八七年（光緒十三年）為一三三，耕地面積雖增加，但與上述人口增加率比較，相關倍數奚替書壤。</p>
<p>人口增加，造成人口過剩現象。張霄嗚與藤原定二氏論太平天國革命發生之原因，實為人口過剩餘所造成，慨乎言之。中國以農立國，人口過剩解決之道，一為政府施行救濟，一為人民自求生存。政府救濟，即發展工業，改良農業生產，開墾沙田荒地。人民自求生存，即向外移住，流為乞丐盜匪，所謂壯者散諸四方，強者挺而走險。</p>
<p>上海人口三百八十九萬，失業者據報章所載達過半數以上，前途危機，不堪設想，失業者如何使之減少？人口過剩問題如何使之解決？根本政策，似應從速考慮。</p>
<h3>說燈謎</h3>
<p>— 朝春</p>
<p>文人之筆，無所不能，文章詩詞之外，燈謎亦其一也。吾最愛紅樓夢中寶玉所作，謎底為鏡，而謎面照集四書語曰：「南面而坐，北面而朝，象憂亦憂，象喜亦喜。」字面之大方，口吻之自然，固得未曾有，細思此四語，若專為此謎而設，不亦怪哉！</p>
<p>近於席間，有友人述慈禧辛丑廻　後，壬寅元宵，自製一謎，面為四多字，謎底則夏歷節令二，然注明非清明榖雨等等二十四氣節候，懸之燈上，自十三夜上燈，至十八日落燈，五日內宮中固無人猜中，元宵後，傳示兩書譯（即南書房，上書房）翰林，亦皆未猜出，卒由慈禧自宣，為「除夕」「七夕」兩名詞。此謎面之難猜，蓋在所寫，為四多字，人均向多字着想，自不易猜中，若寫八夕字，則除一夕即七夕，可以一望而知，慈禧亦狡獪矣哉。有此聰明，然庚子一役，終屋清社，亦可謂聰明一世，　　一時矣。</p>
<h3>「薛平貴」</h3>
<p>— 企馮</p>
<p>抗戰期中，薛伯陵（岳）將軍以戰區司令兼主湘政，當時長沙衡陽等地，物價差動極烈，薛氏乃首創評價會思有以平抑，詎知開會評議一次，即等於承認物價合法上漲一次，於是市場風暴益一發不可收拾，湘人譏嘲此種工作為「薛平貴」，以薛氏平抑物價愈平愈貴也。可見在湘北三戰三捷，玩日寇於股掌上之薛將軍，對於神通廣大之商賣，竟是束手無策。</p>
<p>今日上海之情形亦復如是。所謂評議會殆成商人提高物價之立法機構。以白米為例，尙億今年一月間，僅售七·八萬元一担，在二月初的黃金潮中，因接受米商「產地報漲」的理由，將官價調整為十萬餘元，追認百分三十之上漲率。本月初，　資由證券市場改趨日用商品，物價再起波動，於是白米官價復調整為十二萬餘元。</p>
<p>當局　念商艱固無微不至，但商人則未嘗稍稍體恤小民。刻下高級白米每担叩二十　關，小民夢寐以求十二萬餘元之官定限價而不可得，言念及此，曷勝痛心，語曰：「治亂世·用重典。」今日欲求合理的評價，實不啻與　謀皮。</p>
<h3>賽球的教訓</h3>
<p>— 張菊蓀</p>
<p>漢城隊來上海第一仗便旗開得勝，二比一輕取蘇聯。精湛的球術，值得欽佩。</p>
<p>然而第二戰竟於十二　　內打定紀錄，真像變成波那派德，拿破崙一樣，二比〇敗於「滑鐵路」了。據說因為輕敵，開　以預備員交鋒，待到連失二球，急調正規軍登場，無奈已殘局不能收拾，真是「失足留下千古恨」。</p>
<p>（三次會戰，漢城即輕取捷旗，是不是人家比我們高明呢？編者）。</p>
<p>我們並非輕視鐵路的球藝，但對客車的這次敗北不能無感。假使引用吾國通俗的歷史來比喻，祇可謂「大意失荊州」了。</p>
<p>且看聯合社的電訊：華盛頓郵報體育編輯兼全國體育作家與廣播員協會會長韓布斯宣稱，定於五月十七十八兩日，在此間哥倫比亞俱樂部，舉行美國名人高爾夫球賽。低音歌王平克勞斯貝將與參議院政策委員主席塔虎脫合作，影星鯨勃霍柏則與陸軍參謀總長艾森蒙威爾配搭……。另有報名者眾院議長馬丁，檢察長克拉克，海軍總司令尼米資等；這種人材濟濟，薈萃一堂的球賽，國人看來若不自慚，或者會有人疑心美國人在發賽球狂吧。雖然他們如此的熱心習球，而佔領軍依舊在日本賽球受挫。想信日本的球隊要來上戰書，即使我們用對付漢城的手段來造成戰蹟，還該牢記心頭：日本人的個性不比朝鮮人！</p>
<p>借漢，鐵之戰為前車之鑒，我們已收到「天下無不敗之軍的教訓。成功的格言是絕無僅有：「埋頭苦幹」！</p>

<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>老祝正在沉思。他懂得這個絕頂油滑的老官僚的心理，知道再多說也沒有用；可是這件事實在太使他為難了！老諸肯答應有一個人搭他的小包車，這是難得的一個機會；但蘭一家有三個人，並且其中有兩個是孩子，敎他們怎麼能分散呢？要是爽快謝絕的話，豈不又白白錯過了。前綫的局勢又是那麼惡化，蘭帶着兩個孩子再不快走，前途真是不堪設想。</p>
<p>「好」！最後他才打定了主意——走掉一個好一個。「既然協座再無其他方法可想，我也不敢勉強，只是方才承你答應的話，希望不再發生變化！」</p>
<p>「那是一定的！」金愛麗急着插嘴出　。「他說的話要是不算，我也寗可不走！祝先生，你放心！」</p>
<p>老祝和老諸同時向她看了一眼。</p>
<p>「愛麗，多謝你！」祝兆年很受到一些感動。「胡太太自己是不可能跟你們走的，大概總是緋緋或者小榮，一路上還得請你特別照料。胡先生胡太太一定會感激你的！」</p>
<p>金愛麗很高興筆　點點頭。老諸也不說什麼，甚至相當的贊同。因為他知道，這一路上重慶去，為了要接洽賣買，調度車輛，自己必然很忙，把金愛麗這樣一個女人獨自撇在旅館裏或任何一個朋友家裏，都足以使他放心不下；有一個小孩子牽伴着她，那就等於自己有了一個代表。而且小孩子在車上用不到佔多少地位，更不致影響自己預定的計劃。</p>
<p>一個茶房勿勿地奔進來，招呼：「諸協理，有電話！」</p>
<p>「很好。」老祝忽忙站起來說：「我這就走了！待我去跟胡太太商量一下，不論是緋緋或者小榮，吃飯以前，我一定把他帶到這裏來！」最後，他又向諸老頭兒特別補上一句：「也許還有一兩件行李」</p>
<p>「好！好！好！」老諸急着想把他打發走，便不住口的答應。</p>
<p>「你放心走吧！一切交給我好了！」金愛麗也站起來送他，並且顯出很負責的樣子。</p>
<p>於是祝兆年　勿勿趕回東江。自從昨晚在二塘想上火車沒有成功之後，蘭實在不願意再回徐家去了，老祝也不主張她再去，好在他自己借住的那家小學校裏所有的人全走完了，空屋很多，暫時借住幾天是不成問題的。這樣，蘭和她的兒女便在樓下一間大教室裏打了公館，用二三十張課桌併成了一張大牀。（四二）</p>

<h3>Formal Establishment of the National Government Committee; Chairman Chiang Decides to Personally Deliver a Speech; Presidents of the Five Yuan and Government Committee Members to Take Office Simultaneously</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 22nd] The reorganized National Government Committee is scheduled to hold its first meeting at 10:00 AM on the 23rd in the National Government Auditorium. Approximately 23 government committee members are expected to attend. Chairman Chiang and Vice Chairman Sun will both be present. The presidents of the various Yuan will attend as ex officio members. This marks the first time in the 20 years since the establishment of the National Government that members of the Kuomintang, other political parties, and non-party individuals will gather to jointly discuss practical political affairs. People across the country and around the world place boundless hope in this new Government Committee, hoping that it will promote a new spirit, establish a new style, select new personnel, and implement new policies. This will shorten the period of tutelage government to achieve a transition to constitutional government, complete preparations for the realization of democratic constitutionalism, and pave a clear path for the construction of a new China. The participation of people from various parties in the Government Committee is somewhat similar in form to the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), but the tasks of the two are vastly different. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Democratic League, which participated in the PCC to jointly discuss reorganization, have refused to participate in this reorganization of the government. There are no CCP or Democratic League figures within the committee, but the government still reserves places, leaving them vacant. Chairman Chiang will deliver a brief speech before the meeting, after which the rules of procedure drafted by the Office of Civil Affairs will be discussed first. The new President of the Executive Yuan, Zhang Qun, will also present a list of ministers and political committee members to be approved at the meeting. There are a total of 28 new government committee members. Wu Xianzai of the Democratic Socialist Party is in Hong Kong and will only be able to arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the 23rd before transferring to Nanjing. He Luzhi of the Youth Party is ill in Shanghai and unable to attend the meeting in Nanjing. Therefore, those expected to attend tomorrow are approximately as follows: Zhang Qun, Sun Ke, Yu Youren, Dai Chuanxian (Ju Zheng is in Hankou and unable to attend), Zhang Ji, Zou Lu, Song Ziwen, Weng Wenhao, Wang Chonghui, Shao Lizi, Wang Shijie, Jiang Menglin, Niu Yongjian, Liang Hancao, Chen Zai Lei, Zeng Qi of the Youth Party, Chen Qitian, Yu Jiaju, Hu Haimen of the Democratic Socialist Party, Ji Yiqiao, and prominent figures Mo Dehui and Wang Yunwu. Although Zeng Qi is ill in the Central Hospital, he has decided to make an effort to attend.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The reorganized National Government Committee is scheduled to be formally established on the 23rd. At the same time, the newly appointed National Government Committee members and presidents of the five Yuan will be formally sworn into office. No separate swearing-in ceremony will be held. It is reported that at the meeting tomorrow, the Chief of Civil Affairs, Wu Dingchang, will first explain the significance of the government reorganization, followed by a speech from Chairman Chiang. After a short break, the meeting will formally begin. The agenda for discussion will be the rules of the National Government Committee meeting. It is heard that the reorganization of the Executive Yuan will also be brought up for discussion, and the selection of political committee members and heads of various ministries and commissions will be decided.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Regarding the selection of another government committee member from the Democratic Socialist Party, members of the party all look to Xu Fulin. Since Mr. Xu came to Nanjing to meet with Chairman Chiang, he has been considering this matter. According to Jiang Yuntian, there are probably no problems.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 22nd] The Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee and the National Defense Council are scheduled to hold a joint meeting at 9:00 AM on the 23rd. This is likely the last gathering of the National Defense Council, as the duties of the National Defense Council will be largely transferred to the Government Committee on the same day.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 22nd] Following the reorganization of the National Government, vice presidents of the five Yuan will also be selected soon. With Wei Daoming assuming the position of Chairman of the Taiwan Province, it is expected that the vacancy for the Vice President of the Legislative Yuan will be filled in the near future, with Jiao Yitang and Liu Zhe being possible candidates. However, it is heard that the Democratic and Youth Parties are also quite interested in this position. As for the vice presidents of the Control Yuan and the Judicial Yuan, they also need to be selected following the passing of Liu Shangqing and Qin Zhen. What is currently known is that Zhou Zhongyue, the Vice President of the Examination Yuan, will likely continue in his position. It has been internally decided that Wang Yunwu will assume the position of Vice President of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 22nd] Ji Yiqiao and Hu Haimen of the Democratic Socialist Party arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 22nd, accompanied by Lei Zhen. The three visited Zhang Qun one after another to discuss the reorganization of the Executive Yuan. Xu Fulin is scheduled to take the night train to Shanghai on the 23rd to participate in the Government Committee affairs, which will be decided after arriving in Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 22nd] Lei Zhen hosted a banquet at his residence on the evening of the 22nd, inviting Xu Fulin, Jiang Yuntian, Ji Yiqiao, and Hu Haimen of the Democratic Socialist Party, with Shao Lizi as a guest.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 22nd] Zuo Shunsheng of the Youth Party arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai at around 8:00 PM on the afternoon of the 22nd and immediately went to the Central Standing Committee of the Youth Party on Putuo Road, where Chen Shi attended to discuss participating in the Executive Yuan. Although the candidates have been internally decided, the list has not been sent out tonight because the matter of joining the government still needs to be discussed with the government, such as the method of participation, such as participating in local governments. A meeting will be held again on the morning of the 23rd to discuss this.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 22nd] The new Government Committee member, Song Ziwen, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai at 9:30 AM on the 22nd to participate in the first Government Committee meeting convened after the reorganization on the 23rd.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] Sun Ke, the President of the Legislative Yuan, returned to Nanjing from Shanghai at 7:40 AM on the morning of the 22nd. Mr. Sun disembarked at Hepingmen and went straight to his private residence. Top Image: (From right: Zhang Qun, Sun Ke, Ju Zheng, Dai Chuanxian, Yu Youren)</p>

He will also broadcast to the nation on the Central Radio Station at 7:00 PM this evening (the station broadcasts on medium wave 660 kHz and shortwave 9730 and 11835 kHz).

<h3>Xiao Zheng Resigns from the Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Position</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 22nd] Vice Minister Xiao Zheng of Economic Affairs has resigned from his position to the authorities multiple times and has not been to the ministry to work since the 21st. The National College of Law and Commerce, founded by Mr. Xiao, has been in session for many days, and Mr. Xiao, who also serves as the president of the college, finds it difficult to balance administrative work, so he intends to temporarily relinquish government affairs to focus on education.</p>
<h3>Hu Haimen and Ji Yiqiao Issue Statement on Participating in the National Government</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] Hu Haimen and Ji Yiqiao of the Chinese Democratic Socialist Party issued a statement on the 22nd regarding their participation in the National Government. The original text is as follows: The purpose of the Democratic Socialist Party's participation in the National Assembly is to seek the passage of a constitution that complies with the principles of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), establish a model of democratic constitutionalism, and move our country one step forward towards democracy. Although the Communist Party insists on its views and did not participate in the National Assembly, it is indeed a regrettable matter. However, the promulgation of the democratic constitution is the foundation for the implementation of democratic politics. In politics, it ends the one-party rule of the Kuomintang and embarks on the road to democracy.</p>
<p>After the promulgation of the democratic constitution, our party naturally does not want it to become a mere formality. There are still issues related to the implementation of constitutionalism, such as the formulation of election laws and other laws, which the Kuomintang cannot handle alone. Therefore, our party has decided to participate in the four institutions.</p>
<p>Our party is formed by the merger of the National Socialist Party and the Democratic Constitutionalist Party. It is still in the preparatory stage of organization. It originally intended to cultivate its own development as an opposition party, while assisting the government in implementing constitutionalism, hoping to make efforts for one or two decades to enable our country to implement democratic socialism. Because of this purpose, in the statement of participating in the four institutions on February 15, there was the statement "As for shouldering the actual responsibility of decision-making and administration, it will wait until all parties in the country work together for peace and democracy."</p>
<p>However, things did not go as planned. The Kuomintang government authorities earnestly stated that if all parties do not participate in the reorganized government during this transitional period, the Supreme National Defense Committee cannot be abolished, and the one-party tutelage of the Kuomintang cannot be ended. Our party has always advocated the implementation of democratic constitutionalism by peaceful means and opposes any form of one-party rule. Today, the Kuomintang has the intention of ending one-party rule, and our party cannot refuse people from thousands of miles away. Therefore, there is the signing of the twelve points of common governance principles and the decision to participate in the reorganized government. Our party hopes to reflect some of the people's appeals from these twelve points and participate in the government as representatives of a part of the people to urge the administration to adapt to the people's demands in implementation. We want to clearly tell the world that this participation in the government is to help the government end tutelage and absolutely oppose the so-called joint tutelage of the three parties. Our actions are to seek the realization of democratic politics, to relieve the people from suffering, not to gain a position of tutelage by one party, let alone to seek any benefits for the party itself. We can also sincerely tell the people that our participation in the government this time reserves the freedom of advance and retreat and is prepared for sacrifice.</p>
<p>Therefore, our party's participation in the reorganized government this time takes the twelve points as the basic program, and its essence is nothing more than three: First, to promote the peaceful unification of our country; second, to establish the foundation of democratic rule of law; and third, to represent the people in seeking to relieve their suffering and reduce social disorder. Our party will, in a responsible spirit, strive to realize the above-mentioned platform, and hereby formally inform the people of the country, hoping that the people of the country will be our support, and encourage each other with our party comrades.</p>
<h3>Zheng Dongguo and Others Fly to Nanjing; See Chairman to Request Instructions on the Lushun and Dalian Issues</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 22nd] Zheng Dongguo, Deputy Commander of the Northeast Security, Dong Yanping, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Headquarters, and Zhang Jianfei, Special Diplomatic Envoy to the Northeast, arrived in Nanjing by special plane from Beiping at 1:55 PM on the 22nd. Zheng and others came at the invitation of the Chairman to request instructions and report on military affairs in the Northeast and the takeover of Lushun and Dalian. Zheng answered reporters at the airport, saying that the Northeast war is still calm except for some contact around Tonghua. This time, he came to discuss the issue of troop supplies with the government and will return shortly. Dong answered reporters' questions about the takeover of Lushun and Dalian, saying that according to the spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, there should be no problem with both sides stationing troops in Lushun, but negotiations are still underway. Zheng, Dong, and others paid a visit to the Chairman on the same day.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch of the 22nd] Regarding the Lushun Sino-Soviet Joint Committee, our side has already decided to send Dong Yanping. It is heard that the other candidate has been internally decided as Zhu Mao or Tang Huang.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch of the 22nd] Gong Xuesui will take a Pan American Airways flight to Beiping on the 23rd. After a brief stop, he will take a train to Shenyang on the 25th. Gong's visit does not symbolize that the takeover of Dalian has made new progress. It is heard that Gong is only going to Shenyang to do some preparatory work. The United Takeover Committee of Dalian will be established after Gong arrives in Shenyang.</p>
<h3>Administrative Governor-General's Office Abolished; Wei Daoming Appointed Chairman of Taiwan; Some Provincial Committee Members to be Appointed from Taiwan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The Executive Yuan decided at its 784th regular meeting on the morning of the 22nd to abolish the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Governor-General's Office and reorganize it in accordance with the provincial government organization law, and appointed Wei Daoming (see right) as a member and chairman of the Taiwan Provincial Government. [Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 22nd] After the announcement that Wei Daoming will be the chairman of the Taiwan Province, other provincial committee members can also be announced soon.

Deputy positions will also be added to various departments and bureaus in order to elect talented people from Taiwan as soon as possible.

<h3>Brief Biography of Wei Daoming</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The newly appointed Chairman of the Taiwan Provincial Government, Wei Daoming, courtesy name Bocong, is 51 years old and from Jiujiang, Jiangxi. In 1917, he graduated from the First Middle School of Jiangxi. He then went to Beiping to enter the French Literature School. In 1919, he went abroad to study at the University of Paris.

He was then sent to Europe and the United States as a standing committee member of the Construction Committee to inspect new construction in various countries. In 1928, he returned to China and served as a member of the Central Political Committee. After that, he also served as the mayor of Nanjing (1930), the Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan (1936), and the ambassador to the United States (1942). After returning from the United States last year, he served as the vice president of the Legislative Yuan until now.</p>
<h3>Spokesperson of the Central Propaganda Department Discusses the Reorganization of Taiwan Province</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The spokesperson of the Central Propaganda Department stated: At the Executive Yuan meeting on the morning of the 22nd, former Ambassador to the United States Dr. Wei Daoming was appointed as the chairman of the Taiwan Provincial Government to replace Governor-General Chen Yi. At the same time, two decisions were made: (1) Abolish the system of the Taiwan Administrative Governor-General's Office so that Taiwan adopts the same provincial government system as other provinces. (2) Add the position of deputy director to each department of the Taiwan Provincial Government. All these deputy directors will be Taiwanese. Although Taiwanese are completely Chinese, after 51 years of Japanese occupation, two generations have been separated from the motherland. The establishment of deputy directors is intended to enable them to be familiar with the political system and all laws and regulations of the country. Mr. Wei is a civilian, not a military man. Chairman Chiang believes that solving the urgent economic and educational problems in Taiwan after the war requires a capable civilian.</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting in Western Yimeng Mountain Area; National Army Tightening the Encirclement; All Roads Advance Simultaneously to Recover Many Places</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 22nd] The National Army in Shandong Province is tightening its encirclement of the Communist army retreating to the Yimeng Mountain area. The National Army has been advancing steadily on all roads in recent days. On the 21st, it advanced to the Tangtou and Chayeshan line north of Linyi, to the Bancheng (south of Qingtuo Temple) line in the northwest, and to the Zhuman-Chengyang line northeast of Feixian County. The National Army of Sishui Baibai advanced northeastward from Zhongtong and Daqiao and other places. On the 21st, it captured Guanzhuang, Tiantai Mountain, Wutou Mountain, Majiayu and other strongholds respectively, and after recovering Gongli east of Loude, it continued to advance towards Xintai. It is expected that the National Army will have brilliant results on all roads within three to five days.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The Qiu Corps of the National Army Tang Enbo yesterday launched a counterattack against the Communist army in northern Linyi, with brilliant results. The eastern route advanced to Tangtou Town between Linyi and Juxian, which is 42 li away from Linyi and is an important stronghold for the Communist army to connect the two sides of the Yi River. There are five pontoon bridges nearby. With this, the National Army has cut off the connection between the Communist army on the east bank of the Yi River and the Yimeng Mountain area. The central route advanced to Chayeshan between Linyi and Yishui. The mountain is 40 li away from Linyi and is the only high ground that protects the north of Linyi. The western route advanced to Bancheng between Linyi and Mengyin. The area is 45 li away from Linyi and is the throat of Linyi leading to Mengyin. All of the above strongholds have been operated by the Communist army for seven years and have strong fortifications. The main force of the Communist army, which resisted stubbornly on the line, seems to be the 6th Column. It was heroically and painfully attacked by the Tang Corps and collapsed northward. The Tang Corps is still chasing north in victory.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The National Army in Xishan, Yimeng Mountain area, started climbing the mountain on the morning of the 22nd and engaged in fierce fighting with the guard troops of the Communist Army's 1st Column in Haitai Mountain, Majiayu and other places about 20 li away from Mengyin City.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 22nd] The Communist Army Liu Bocheng's unit, which disturbed northern Henan Province, has struggled for two sentences at the greatest cost, but has gained nothing so far. The National Army in Anyang, Tangyin and other places is as solid as a rock, and the main force of the National Army in Fanxian and Huixian has begun to mop up to the north. Now, the 1237th Column of the Let Bocheng Department moved north from the area west of Hua County and north of the Wei River on the 21st, claiming to attack Tangyin again. Judging from his intentions, it seems to avoid the National Army's advance.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 22nd] The Hong Kong government's suspension of approving US dollar exchange applications from importers on the 12th has caused repercussions.

The Hong Kong government must also seek self-sufficiency in US dollar transactions, and pointed out that the reason for the Hong Kong government's strict control of US dollar exchange is that remittances from overseas Chinese in the US to Hong Kong are now using bank drafts payable in the US, and Hong Kong exporters are receiving US dollar payments in the US, so that the Hong Kong government cannot purchase US dollars. The spokesperson continued to say that British people in Hong Kong must sell their US dollars to the government at the official rate, but Chinese people can still keep their US dollars, but no one is allowed to buy or sell foreign currency privately.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Necessity of Improving Price Negotiation</h3>
<p>The recent wave of price increases has many causes. Moreover, the reasons for the rise in the prices of various goods are not entirely the same. For example, the price of rice is said to be due to rising production costs, the price of oil due to a shortage of raw materials, and the price of cotton cloth due to expensive raw materials and sales promotions. Therefore, measures to suppress prices must be sought from multiple perspectives, which is naturally an undeniable truth. However, to eliminate speculation and eradicate black markets, it seems that there is still a need to improve the application of price negotiation.</p>
<p>In addition to using loans, opening up sources, and increasing production as fundamental solutions to suppress prices, the authorities seem to have two stopgap measures: one is a rigid approach, namely adopting price negotiation methods to guide prices towards reasonable and legitimate channels. By using both approaches simultaneously, combining firmness and flexibility, if applied properly, it seems that a considerable effect of moderating prices can be achieved to some extent.</p>
<p>However, judging from the market situation in recent weeks, the wave of price increases has been extremely intense. Even if there is an occasional pullback, it is nothing more than a large increase followed by a small decrease, still rising along a curved line. Moreover, the black market is rampant, and speculators are emerging in droves. Manufacturers who care about their reputation are forced to comply with price negotiations and understand that they are losing money, so they all reluctantly make sacrifices and complain loudly. This is most evident in the cotton cloth sector. Consequently, the authorities' strict investigations and handling methods have not achieved significant results. There is no mystery in this. It is simply because the profits are too high and the money is made too quickly, so speculators are willing to take risks by any means possible and are happy to test the law. On the other hand, producers feel it is a pity to miss out on huge profits, so they cannot help but take risks and venture into the black market.</p>
<p>If market prices can be adjusted in a timely manner to prevent them from being too detached from reality, then excessive profits will be reduced, and the arrogance of speculators can be greatly diminished. On the supply side, since the losses will not be too great, they may not be willing to break the law and secretly sell in the black market. According to Article 13 of the Implementation Regulations for Price Assessment, when there are drastic changes in the cost of goods and there is a need to assess new prices, renegotiation is permitted, and there is no time limit. Furthermore, Article 10 of the same regulations states that the calculation of the cost of goods, in addition to manufacturing costs or the original purchase price, may include interest, taxes, transportation costs, warehouse rent, management fees, insurance, and depreciation. According to these regulations, reasonable prices are not difficult to obtain. Moreover, the proviso of Article 13 clearly stipulates that prices cannot be increased before being approved. Article 15 also stipulates that those who violate the approved price negotiation can be punished in accordance with the regulations on cracking down on violations of price limits and price negotiation. If this can be implemented, not only will merchants and civilians not blindly rush around and easily fall into legal traps, but the government's law enforcement will also be more convenient to carry out. Therefore, we can choose not to discuss price negotiation. But once price negotiation has been implemented, timely and reasonable adjustments seem necessary.</p>
<p>Some people believe that frequent changes in negotiated prices will only fuel price increases. In times of scarcity and when supply and demand cannot meet, this drawback is indeed unavoidable. However, in such circumstances, if there is no fundamental solution and one relies solely on passive measures to curb prices, this is, in fact, questionable. As in recent times, the authorities' supervision and punishment have been vigorous and diligent, but the wave of price increases has been difficult to eliminate, and the black market remains rampant, which can be said to be clear evidence. Rather than sticking to fixed negotiated prices without allowing flexibility, which only leads to a rampant black market that cannot be suppressed, it is better to adjust prices according to the law, which can still achieve a considerable effect of moderation.</p>
<p>Taking the price of cotton cloth as an example, the cost has indeed reached around five million recently, while the negotiated price has always been within the four million range. It is said that the authorities are also well aware of this unreasonable restriction. However, once adjusted, the negotiated price will inevitably be raised, which will inevitably be subject to criticism. It is better to turn a blind eye and let things take their course, which can avoid personal responsibility. It is not known whether such a style of work actually amounts to creating a black market, fueling speculation, and causing merchants who seek immediate gains to adopt improper conduct. The national price negotiation policy will then invisibly diminish its credibility and value. We believe that this is an unwise and irresponsible action before the price negotiation policy has been clearly changed.</p>

<h3>Marshall Urges Senate to Pass Aid to Greece and Turkey Bill, Says He Fully Agrees with the Plan</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 21st] The Senate's discussion of President Truman's plan to aid Greece and Turkey will be put to a vote tomorrow, and it is certain to pass. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg read a telegram from Secretary of State Marshall from Moscow today, stating: "Senator Vandenberg: I am aware that some questions have arisen regarding my involvement in the plan to aid Greece and Turkey. As you know, I participated in the drafting and decision-making of this plan before departing for Moscow. On March 26, when I arrived in Paris, the President telegraphed me the message he intended to present to Congress on March 12, and I immediately informed the State Department of my full agreement. I personally and the State Department have urged the immediate passage of the aid bill. I believe this plan is necessary, and I fully agree with the State Department's and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman's urging of Congress to pass this bill." Marshall's telegram was prompted by questions from Republican Senator Wiley. Wiley told the Senate last week that there were rumors that Marshall did not fully agree with the policy of aid to Greece and Turkey.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] Truman and Marshall made important arrangements today to support the aid to Greece and Turkey bill, which is expected to pass in the Senate tomorrow. Truman reiterated his support for this measure to resist communist influence in the Near East, while Marshall followed suit, sending a letter from Moscow urging the Senate to pass the promised $400 million loan, considering it to be "of utmost importance."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 21st] Republican Senator Ferguson returned from the Middle East and recently gave a speech expressing his support for the US plan to aid Greece and Turkey. It is said that the only way to make the Soviet Union stop its psychological warfare against Turkey is for Turkey and the Soviet Union to form an agreement guaranteeing Turkey's borders. I propose transferring the existing lend-lease materials from Egypt and Iran to Greece and Turkey. I do not think that Britain will object to this, as we are currently relieving Britain of its burden in the Near East, but Britain will still share its benefits. As long as Turkey has to spend most of its budget on maintaining troops, it will not be able to improve its position politically and economically. United Nations agencies must obtain sufficient power to guarantee the inviolability of the borders of small countries, so that the United States does not have to be asked to intervene every time a new crisis threatens world security.</p>
<h3>Molotov's Reply to Marshall Explains Soviet Stance on Korea, US-Soviet Joint Commission Expected to Resume Work</h3>
<p>[Our News] London, 22nd Broadcast: Molotov wrote to Marshall, accusing the United States of violating the Moscow Agreement on the Korean issue, but agreed that the United States and the Soviet Union should make renewed efforts to promote the unification of Korea. Molotov suggested that the US-Soviet Joint Commission on Korean issues meet in Seoul on May 20. [United Press International, Moscow, 22nd] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov today replied to a letter from US Secretary of State Marshall, proposing that the US-Soviet Joint Commission on Korean Affairs resume work in Seoul on May 20. Molotov's reply also put forward three suggestions: (1) To form a temporary Korean government, with the unanimous participation of various democratic parties and public organizations in the country, to promote political and economic unification, abolish the demarcation line between the northern and southern occupied areas, and complete independence. (2) To hold free and equal general elections to establish a democratic parliament. (3) To assist the Korean people in their revival into an independent and democratic country, and to develop their national economy and culture. The so-called assistance is obviously to be jointly provided by the United States and the Soviet Union. In two letters to Molotov on the 8th of this month, Marshall urged two steps to resolve the Korean issue: (1) Resume the work of the US-Soviet Joint Commission to find ways to complete Korean independence based on respect for democratic rights and freedom of speech. (2) For the US and Soviet governments to review the work of the committee on a date to be selected this summer. The committee completely stalled in May last year due to disagreements between US and Soviet representatives on which democratic parties and public organizations should have a say in politics. Molotov's reply was dated April 19 and was released today, with copies sent to British Foreign Secretary Bevin and Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Chuan Bingchang.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 22nd] At the opening of the Far East International Tribunal today, US defense lawyer Lazarus presented the history of communist activities in Europe and Asia to prove that the anti-communist policy of the Japanese militarists was correct.

<h3>The Issue of Palestine's Independence</h3>
<p>Egypt Requests Inclusion in UN General Assembly Agenda</p>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 21st] Egypt today formally requested that the United Nations terminate Britain's 25-year mandate in Palestine, immediately declare the Holy Land an independent country, and request that this motion be submitted for discussion at the United Nations General Assembly special session to be held in New York on the 20th of this month.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 22nd] According to initial investigations today, the United States and the United Kingdom can obtain sufficient support from countries in the United Nations to prevent Arab countries from demanding the immediate independence of Palestine. It is heard that the South American countries are preparing to take a neutral stance on this dispute, but have strongly indicated that they oppose the inclusion of Egypt's proposal in the agenda of this meeting.</p>
<h3>Drafting Committee on Atomic Energy, Deadlock in Work</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 22nd] The drafting committee of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission has held four meetings without reaching an agreement and adjourned last night. Soviet representative Gromyko refused to explain the definition of "control and supervision" in his amendments. At the same time, the timing of the implementation of control is also a major point of contention. The Soviet Union insisted on implementing it "immediately" after the signing of the international atomic energy convention, while the United States favored using the phrase "as soon as possible." The Polish representative proposed a compromise, but it did not succeed, so the meeting was postponed and will reopen on the 30th of this month if conditions permit.</p>
<h3>Four Foreign Ministers' Secret Meeting Discusses Difficulties in Austrian Peace Treaty, German Issue Likely to Be Temporarily Shelved</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 22nd] The four foreign ministers held their second secret meeting today, attempting to eliminate differences of opinion on the Austrian peace treaty. According to authoritative sources: "In this heart-pounding meeting, the hope of reaching an Austrian peace treaty has not been completely cut off."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 21st] At 5:45 PM today, US Secretary of State General Marshall believed that continuing the discussion would be useless and suggested holding a secret meeting. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov immediately agreed. According to responsible sources: In the secret meeting, Marshal Marshall asked the foreign ministers of the three countries whether they still insisted on their original proposals on several basic points on which no agreement had been reached. He asked Foreign Minister Molotov if the Soviet government had any room for reconsideration of the proposal he made at the secret meeting on April 1 regarding the issue of reparations extracted from Germany's current production. If there was no room for reconsideration, Marshall would request the adjournment of the foreign ministers' meeting, but the time and place of the next meeting must be stipulated. After the secret meeting adjourned, opinions on the success of the secret meeting varied, but it was also said that the issue of German property in Austria and the Austrian border issue would soon be resolved. It can be asserted that the four foreign ministers' meeting will no longer discuss the German issue. Even the US side said that the secret meeting only discussed the Austrian peace treaty issue. British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault believed several days ago that such fruitless debates should be stopped immediately and that an agreement could only be reached after the foreign ministers had deliberated at length and held a new meeting. If the four foreign ministers' meeting adjourns, the four foreign ministers will not have achieved their goals. In other words, Marshal Marshall failed to unify the German economy, British Foreign Secretary Bevin failed to reduce the burden on British taxpayers, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov failed to obtain reparations from West Germany, and French Foreign Minister Bidault was unable to satisfy his demands for the Saar region, and only obtained a few coal mines. Without the Saar region, everything is worthless.</p>
<p>Trieste Report, Discussion Yields No Results</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 21st] Diplomatic observers predict that the Moscow conference may not end as scheduled in the middle of this week. The four foreign ministers today discussed the report of the Trieste Financial Special Committee for two hours, without any results. It was decided to appoint representatives to review the report tomorrow and submit it to the foreign ministers' meeting again on Wednesday. The Trieste Financial Committee was appointed at the New York Foreign Ministers' Conference in December last year to investigate the financial situation of Trieste.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 21st] The four foreign ministers met this morning to discuss the report submitted by the special investigation committee on the financial situation of the Free Territory of Trieste, which stated that the financial budget for the first year was insufficient by $5 million and required foreign assistance. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov said that such assistance should be clearly stipulated to prevent other countries from interfering in the internal affairs of the special zone in an unacceptable manner.</p>
<h3>British and French Delegations Scheduled to Leave Moscow</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 21st] British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault met here today to make final arrangements for the departure of the British and French delegations from the Soviet Union. The French delegation is scheduled to leave the Soviet Union by special train on the evening of the 23rd, and the British delegation will leave on the 24th.</p>

The agreement stipulates the percentages of coal exported from the three German occupied areas to European countries in the six months starting from July this year. According to the regulations unanimously agreed upon by Marshall, Bidault, and Bevin, when the daily coal production in the western occupied area reaches 280,000 tons, 21% will be exported, and when it reaches 370,000 tons, 25% will be exported.</p>

<h3>Five Powers Discuss Together the Selection of Governor of Trieste</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 21st] China participated for the first time today in the discussion of the candidate for Governor of Trieste, a matter that has been considered only by the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union since February. Chinese representative Guo Taiqi has now joined the other four power representatives for consultations, but the reasons have not been explained. Today's meeting lasted 45 minutes without progress. Soviet representative Gromyko firmly recommended Swedish Social Democratic Party Member of Parliament Blondin as a candidate for governor, but the United Kingdom and the United States opposed it, believing that he lacked the experience to take on this complex position.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 21st] Well-informed sources said that the five powers may agree to appoint a candidate from a neutral country as Governor of Trieste, with former Belgian Interior Minister Bousserlet and former Swiss Army Chief of Staff General Guisan being the most popular candidates. The Soviet Union recommended Swedish Social Democratic Party Member of Parliament Blondin, and if a compromise can be reached, the Soviet Union can withdraw this candidate.</p>

<h3>Masterminding Conspiracy and Riots, Trafficking Military Arms: A Terrorist Organization Busted in Western Shanghai; Equipped with Gadgets and Traps Everywhere; Authorities Employ Foreign Technical Advisors to Assist in the Crackdown</h3>
<p>Regarding cases of conspiring to riot and trafficking in military arms, several incidents have recently occurred in the city.

The Garrison Command's Economic Yarn and Cloth Group, responsible for monitoring and stabilizing prices, dispatched a large number of personnel yesterday to several yarn shops to review accounts and inspect warehouses. The results have not yet been released. According to the person in charge, the investigation targets are the true powerful figures who are capable of manipulating the market and triggering price increases. As for small merchants who are not seeking profit, and whose prices have risen slightly above the limit due to cost reasons, they will be dealt with leniently. Therefore, there has been no concrete action such as arresting yarn merchants so far.</p>
<h3>Cao Bin Road Right-of-Way Case: Councilors Propose Compromise</h3>

(3) The Transportation Company should allocate a portion of its profits to the Transportation Committee. (4) The Transportation Company should increase its capital by 20 million (hoping for local participation). (5) The Transportation Company should increase the number of consultants (appointing local figures).

<h3>Legal Rent, Opening Up Real Estate as Collateral: Real Estate Industry Suggests Three Items; Executive Yuan Orders Municipal Government to Investigate and Handle</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The Shanghai Real Estate Industry Association previously stated that the real estate industry has not received sufficient support from the government. On the contrary, it has been subject to excessive and detailed restrictions by laws and regulations, making it difficult to recover. It is not allowed to use real estate as collateral in the banking industry, causing a large number of good assets to lose their value. Therefore, they drafted three measures to save the housing shortage and suggested that the Executive Yuan adopt them: (1) The restriction on rent should be based on Article 97 of the Land Law promulgated in April 1946, which states that the rent "shall not exceed 10% per annum of the declared total value of the land and its buildings." (2) After the rent is reasonably adjusted according to the Land Law, the ban on using real estate as collateral should be lifted. National banks should provide mortgage loans for real estate, but only for the construction of new houses and other productive businesses. (3) A land bank should be established as soon as possible to provide long-term capital to support the real estate industry.</p>
<p>It is now known that the first two of the above suggestions have been approved by the Executive Yuan's President Chiang, and ordered to be handled by the Shanghai Municipal Government. The third item has been forwarded to the Ministry of Finance. After receiving the order, the Municipal Government ordered the Land Administration Bureau and the Counselor's Office to investigate and handle the matter, and forwarded it to the Municipal Council for review.</p>

<h3>Denies Connection with Yu Ying and Wu Shibao: Yang Qing's Traitor Suspect Case Concluded, Verdict Pending</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Yang Qing, accused of being a traitor, concluded his trial in the High Court yesterday, and the verdict is scheduled to be announced on the morning of the 29th. Yang is accused of having been a disciple of Lu Ying, the puppet Shanghai Police Bureau chief, and having been a guard for Wu Shibao, a major figure in "No. 76." As a result, he served as deputy squad leader of the judicial section of the puppet Xujiahui Police Branch in 1938, and in 1944 he served as deputy captain of the Sixth Detective Team of the puppet Shanghai Special Municipal Police Bureau, and was later promoted to captain. After the victory, he continued to serve as a patrol officer in the Xujiahui branch. Later, relevant authorities reported him for handling according to law. The defendant, dressed in a light gray tunic, bald, and with a sorrowful face, admitted to his puppet positions without hesitation, but denied any connection with Yu Ying and Wu Shibao. He argued that he was forced by circumstances, as his 78-year-old mother and seven children had nothing to live on. Previously, during the investigation hearing, many merchants from the Xujiahui area testified in court, proving that the defendant had not committed any crimes detrimental to the people. Yang Qing further stated: "I did arrest small thieves and pickpockets, but I never arrested any underground workers." Subsequently, defense lawyer Yu Enliang argued that the informant in this case, Ma, had falsely accused the defendant out of spite after failing to extort money. If the defendant really had any connection with Yu Ying and Wu Shibao, he would have been reported by the police bureau long ago. How could he have been re-employed at the Xujiahui branch for a year after the victory? He asked the court to investigate carefully. Finally, Judge Xiao concluded: The debate in this case is over, the verdict will be announced on the 29th, and the defendant is allowed to meet with his family before being returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Bank Employee Wearing Police Officer Uniform: Said it Was "For Aesthetic Purposes"</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] While patrolling the intersection of Guangxi Road and Hankou Road, patrol officers from the Police Bureau's Supervisory Division discovered a young man wearing a simplified police officer's uniform, swaggering down the street, which was inappropriate and suspicious. They arrested him and took him to the bureau for questioning. He confessed that his name was Lu Hanqi, 26 years old, living at No. 5, Lane 116, Changshu Road, and currently a clerk at the Quangong Bank. He had joined the Hongkou District Volunteer Police Team as a member in June last year, but later stopped working due to the long distance. Recently, his colleagues at Quangong ridiculed him, saying he was incompetent and had not been promoted to date. In a moment of anger, he went to the Xinchang Military Clothing Store on Lloyd Road and had his former volunteer police uniform altered to a simplified-level police officer's uniform, his sole purpose being "for aesthetic purposes." After the confession, the police bureau, suspecting that he was impersonating a police officer and had other criminal intentions, immediately detained him and handed him over to the Criminal Investigation Division for investigation.</p>

<h3>Dancing Girl Refuses to Go Out: Drug Merchant Brandishes Gun to Attack</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Lyu Xiangyuan, 29 years old, a drug factory owner, went to the Paramount Ballroom in western Shanghai in mid-March and danced with Li Li, a dancing girl (24 years old, from Changzhou, residing at No. 7, Yianfang, Pushi Road, Notre Dame Road). Li Li was skilled in socializing, and Lyu was very fond of her. He went for two weeks in a row and even proposed marriage to Li, but Li only treated him perfunctorily. Lyu mistakenly thought his goal was near, and fell deeply in love, often inviting Li to banquets and trips. At 10:00 PM on the 20th, he went to invite her out again, but was rejected by Li, so he harbored resentment and threatened to deal with her with a pistol. At around 9:00 PM the next afternoon, Lyu actually carried a privately-owned Colt No. 991776 U.S.A. pistol, loaded with seven bullets, and wandered around the ballroom, inviting Li to sit down without success, which aroused his anger. He punched Li and then pulled out his pistol and loaded a bullet to threaten her. He was disarmed by ballroom staff Weng Wenbin and others, who reported to the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station, which ordered patrol officer Xiao Chengzhang to rush to the scene and arrest Lyu for interrogation. According to his confession, the gun was left over from his service in the Military Intelligence Bureau. In addition to sending the firearm to the General Bureau for inspection to ensure no crime, the perpetrator will be sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for trial.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent] The Municipal Cleanliness and Sanitation Management Committee, in view of the frequent occurrence of public urination or dumping of garbage in remote streets and alleys, which is detrimental to health, and the fact that the current penalties stipulated in the Regulations on Violations of Police Law are too lenient to serve as a deterrent, resolved to increase the penalties for violations of cleanliness regulations, changing it to "a fine of no more than 30,000 yuan and no less than 10,000 yuan."

On the morning of the 18th, dressed in uniform, he accompanied his friend Zhang Rerefu to the home of Zhang Zhengfu (a barber from Rugao) at No. 199, Pingmin Village, North Zhabei Road. He claimed to be acting on the orders of the Ministry of National Defense to hunt down bandits and traitors. He took Zhang to Daming Hotel and extorted 500,000 yuan in legal tender, or he would be sent to Nanjing for legal proceedings. Zhang Zhengfu was terrified by this sudden news. After repeated requests, they agreed on 400,000 yuan, to be paid in two installments, and then he was released home. The next morning, Zhang Rerefu went to Zhengfu's home and obtained 200,000 yuan. There was still 200,000 yuan missing, and they agreed to pay it on the 21st.

<h3>Deadline for Reporting Public and Private Losses During the War of Resistance Extended to July</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The Executive Yuan has repeatedly issued orders to report public and private losses suffered during the War of Resistance, but there are still some who have not reported. The Executive Yuan, in view of the fact that the Far Eastern Commission is discussing the issue of Japanese reparations, and China urgently needs to complete the compilation of detailed figures on this loss as a basis for claiming compensation, has specially stipulated that the deadline for reporting public and private losses in all regions (excluding pacification zones and areas occupied by the Communist Party) will be extended to the end of August this year.

<h3>Unscrupulous Sons of Wealthy Families Issue Checks Fraudulently Everywhere: Jiang Xincheng is Not at All Sincere</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Jiang Xincheng, also known as Jiang Liu, a young man in this city, went to Kang Sheng Leather Shoe Store at No. F358, Huashan Road, at 4:00 PM on March 11 to buy a pair of shoes, priced at 130,000 yuan. He paid 60,000 yuan in cash at the time and signed a check for 70,000 yuan from Yuanheng Money Shop. The check was later returned due to insufficient funds. The store owner, Yan Yinshui, reported the incident to the police bureau. Another man, Yuan Yinbing from Changzhou, also accused Jiang Xincheng of using a bad check for 139,000 yuan at his restaurant on March 9. The police bureau went to Yuanheng Money Shop to investigate and found that Jiang Xincheng opened an account on March 5 and received a checkbook. He had continuously issued about 20 bad checks, totaling 2,357,000 yuan. The address he left at the money shop was also fictitious, and he had no fixed residence. On the evening of April 7, at 11:00 PM, he was arrested by the Jing'an Temple Inspection Branch at his friend's house at No. 27, Anle Lane, West Nanjing Road. The case was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday. According to Jiang's confession, he had been accused of fraud in a similar situation before and was acquitted by the court. His father runs a business in this city and is quite wealthy, but he cut off his financial support because he spent money extravagantly outside. He was helpless for a while and resorted to this tactic. The handling prosecutor, Li Mingshan, ordered him to be released on bail, but because his father had notified friends and relatives not to act as his son's guarantor, Jiang Xincheng could not find a guarantor and was taken back into custody by the bailiffs.</p>
<h3>Foreign Judge Sentences Too Lightly: Two Citizens Petition with Ten Thousand Words</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Regarding the foreign businessman "Foreign Tiger" Mesber, who illegally traded foreign exchange and foreign currency, since the district court sentenced him to one year of imprisonment and confiscated 40,000 US dollars and 20,000 Hong Kong dollars on the 14th of this month, there has been much discussion in the outside world. Some say that Judge Meng's sentencing was too lenient, some say that the measures prohibiting the circulation of foreign currency notes themselves have no legal effect, so there is no basis for sentencing, and some pay attention to why hundreds of thousands of US dollars were still returned to the original owner. In addition to the defendant himself and his defense counsel having filed appeals and independent appeals with the High Court, yesterday the District Prosecutor's Office received petitions from citizens Zhao Lixing and Chen Zongdao, residents of North Sichuan Road, believing that the district court's sentence on Mesber was too light and the confiscation was too small, requesting the prosecutor to appeal. The petition was more than ten feet long, with over ten thousand words, listing five reasons, the main content of which is: (1) The Foreign Tiger despises our country's laws, and now our country has joined the ranks of the five powers and cannot be humble. The sentence imposed on Mesber is only one-fifth of the maximum penalty for his crime, which is clearly inappropriate. (2) Operating telegraphic transfers and mail transfers, although not the buying and selling of foreign currency notes, foreign exchange cannot be separated from foreign currency and be independent, and the evils of telegraphic transfers and mail transfers are far greater than those of foreign currency. (3) More than 300,000 US dollars seized from Ebas Co. have not been disposed of or confiscated, which is very incomprehensible. (4) Ebas Co. has continuously engaged in criminal activities from February 18th to March 3rd, the date of the case's resolution, and lists figures on its daily accounts as proof. The petition states: Foreign currency and foreign exchange sold cannot be excused as unrecoverable and not be punished; the proceeds (legal tender) should be confiscated in full. (5) According to Ebas Co.'s accounts, it can be proven that its black market foreign exchange and foreign currency prices rose day by day, which was a planned manipulation. This petition will be reviewed by the original prosecutor in charge of the case, Quan Tao, and the identity and motives of the two named citizens, Zhao and Chen, may be investigated before a decision is made on whether to adopt it.</p>
<h3>Councilor He Inspects Various Banks; Some Suspected of Involvement in the Gold Rush</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] It is reported that He Qishen, a councilor of the Ministry of Finance, and others were ordered to come to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate the gold rush, not limited to the case of suspected collusion and fraud between the Central Bank's Business Bureau and Zhan Liansheng. The inspection of the work of 44 banks in this city has been largely completed recently. According to Councilor He, some of the banks are indeed suspected of involvement in the gold rush. Another part of the banks' business is abnormal. As for the detailed situation, it is not yet time to publish it. In addition, the four banks of Dalu, Chuan Salt, Jin Cheng, and Zhen Ye were inspected directly by three commissioners, but Councilor He believed that their inspection reports were not detailed enough, so he personally went to review them again yesterday.</p>
<h3>Chairman Fang Arrives in Shanghai from Beijing; Still Hopes to Shed the Heavy Responsibility of Party Affairs in the Shortest Possible Time</h3>
<p>Fang Zhi, the chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Party Department, previously requested resignation due to illness. After repeated efforts to persuade him to stay by President Chiang and urging from all sectors of the city, he has dismissed the idea of resigning and returned to Shanghai by train from Beijing yesterday morning at 8 o'clock with Secretary-General Xie Renzhao. After a short rest, Fang went to the Municipal Party Department to handle official business and then drove to the former residence of Deputy Dean Qin to offer condolences and comfort the family. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited yesterday, and he was pleased to make a statement, saying: "In the past five months, with the assistance of the heads of various agencies and leaders from all walks of life, the party affairs of this city have fortunately achieved a certain scale. However, due to my limited talent and heavy responsibilities, I am afraid that I will fail the central government's trust and the local expectations. Therefore, after attending the Third Plenary Session, I have submitted my resignation. Now, because of repeated encouragement from the President and urgent requests from leaders from all walks of life and comrades through letters and telegrams, I have to temporarily return to Shanghai to work. Fortunately, the National Government has been reorganized and democratic politics are making progress day by day. In the future, the promotion of party affairs will be more convenient. If we can get more participation and assistance from all parties, the progress can be expected. However, I still hope to shed the heavy responsibility of party affairs in this city in the shortest possible time." Fang continued, "Recently, prices in this city have risen again, which I am deeply concerned about. I hope that the entire city, from top to bottom, will cooperate and support the government in finding ways to stabilize prices, first by intensifying production and starting from stabilizing the lives of citizens, and then seeking the stability and construction of the entire Shanghai, which will be more convenient."</p>

<h3>Reporter Group Invited to See the Seawall; North Tang Public Surrounds, Raises Seven Demands; Head of Public Works Bureau Explains Allegations of Corruption Are Inaccurate</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The seawall of this city, starting from Wusong in the north and extending to Chuansha County in the south, is about fifteen li long. During the Anti-Japanese War, it was not maintained for years and was severely damaged. The Public Works Bureau started surveying, preparing budgets, and rushing to repair breaches in March of the 35th year of the Republic (1946), and has since completed the work one after another this year. Unexpectedly, the Municipal Council suddenly received a secret report from citizens of Gaoqiao, stating that the Public Works Bureau had engaged in dismantling and repairing the seawall, subcontracting, and other corrupt practices, which has already attracted the attention of people from all walks of life. In order to understand the actual situation, reporters in this city have requested the Public Works Bureau to disclose the truth. The Public Works Bureau sent personnel yesterday morning to accompany more than a dozen reporters from various newspapers in this city to conduct an on-site inspection of the Gaoqiao seawall.</p>
<p>The reporters first went to Nantang to visit. The breaches in the seawall there have all been completed. Many wooden piles have been driven into the beach, and the coast is blocked by a seawall made of rubble, with a concrete retaining wall built on top. Although the surface is simple, the project is quite large. The impact of the sea and the splashing waves are quite spectacular.</p>
<p>Strictly Punish the Foreman Who Stole Piles, Move Back the Dismantled Seawall Stones</p>
<p>When they arrived at Beitang, the vehicles carrying the reporters were suddenly surrounded by local residents. They, supporting the old and leading the young, held five-color banners with slogans, and seemed intent on making things difficult. After the reporters explained, they sent representatives to express their opinions. It was stated that a foreman, Yang Yilang, had stolen piles and used them to make buckets at No. 70, North Street, Gaoqiao, and should be severely punished. Seven demands were made: (1) Demand that the stones removed from the seawall be moved back to their original location for restoration to protect the lives and property of the local people. (2) Strictly investigate and punish the relevant personnel of the illegal and corrupt construction team. (3) Guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again in the future. (4) The restoration must be completed before the autumn floods. (5) When restoring the seawall to its original state, the Seawall Engineering Supervision Committee of the Taqu District People's Representative Assembly must be notified to send personnel to participate in the process, and it can only be considered satisfactory after they are satisfied. (6) Request that the officials write a written report on their inspection impressions to reassure the people. (7) Request that the press be the mouthpiece of the people and make a fair report to impose public opinion sanctions.</p>
<p>The So-Called Dismantling and Repairing of the Seawall is Due to Saving Expenses</p>
<p>The vehicles carrying the reporters were surrounded by the crowd for about fifteen minutes. Only after the reporters agreed to speak out on their behalf did they manage to break through the encirclement. Later, the head of the Public Works Bureau expressed his opinion on this issue, saying: The allegation of "huge corruption" cannot be established because the old stones moved from the old residential area of Xin'gang Biao Family No. 14 Gang to the Zhoujia浜 section of the seawall were due to saving expenses, and the Seawall Engineering Team never reported the account to the government for reimbursement. The implementation of this emergency seawall project has been discussed and designed by many experts. The public's so-called "dismantling and repairing the seawall" is actually due to a lack of understanding of the project. The loose stones scattered on the beach only resist one point of the sea's impact, while after being sorted and arranged to fill the breaches, their strength is increased to ten points. This not only avoids the consumption of expenses but also utilizes waste to the greatest extent. Moreover, this method of emergency seawall repair is not only starting in this city; the Jiangsu Provincial Government has long adopted the same method to repair the seawalls in Jiangnan.</p>
<p>Opinions Can Be Raised, But Avoid Acting Impulsively</p>
<p>The so-called "dismantling and repairing the seawall" was originally a temporary expedient measure because the government currently has no funds and must first rescue the autumn floods. In the future, a concrete retaining wall will still be built for permanent use. The funds currently approved by the Municipal Government are 1.2 billion yuan, and construction can begin as soon as they are allocated. The head of the Public Works Bureau also said: If local residents have opinions on the technology of the seawall project, they can provide them to the Public Works Bureau, but they must avoid acting impulsively. Regarding the foreman's corruption and other situations, it is hoped that they will report the facts so that the Public Works Bureau can thoroughly investigate and deal with them according to the law. The authorities have already begun a secret investigation into the case of foreman Yang Yilang's corruption as claimed by the residents.</p>

<h3>Jiaotong University Launches Campaign to Protect the School; Teachers and Students Speak Passionately in a Forum to Discuss the Current Crisis; Democratic Wall Covered with Notices Demanding Representatives Go to Beijing to Petition</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Jiaotong University School Protection Association, in order to make students care about their alma mater, held a forum at the school in Xujiahui in this city on the evening of the 21st to discuss "The Crisis and Future of Jiaotong University." More than 500 professors and students attended, and the situation was very enthusiastic. President Wu Bao first spoke: "The navigation and marine engineering department must be run by Jiaotong University, and it must be changed from a discipline to a department, but we must do it carefully and steadily." Next, Dean made a statement: "The Ministry of Education's plan is to turn Jiaotong University into a university of engineering, suitable for a specialized policy, but for other schools, it is implementing a comprehensive policy. I really don't understand why it is so contradictory?" Professor Chen Shiying then spoke: "We are learning crafts, and the bureaucrats are playing tricks. We want teachers and students to work together and not be manipulated by bureaucrats." Dean Ji, the director of general affairs, reported that the school's finances were difficult, with a monthly shortfall of 70 million yuan, saying: "This kind of invisible blood-draining policy is worse than eating roots and leaves!" Dean and Professor Zhong Zhaolin also unanimously stated: "If the current crisis is not resolved, Jiaotong University has no future!" Students also spoke passionately. Yesterday, the school's democratic wall was covered with notices demanding representatives go to Beijing to petition. The school association is discussing going to Beijing to petition and deploying everything.</p>

<h3>Zhenjiang Teachers Owed Salaries; Selling Tax Grain to Clear Debts and Relieve Sorrow with Alcohol</h3>

<h3>Tianjin and Beijing Will Experience a Textbook Shortage This Autumn</h3>
<p>[Tianjin Shipping News] The Tianjin Education Bureau, following the order of the Ministry of Education, convened local publishers to discuss the issue of printing and selling nationally designated textbooks locally. The publishers raised issues such as the allocation ratio for each company, sales guarantees, paper foreign exchange, and printing loans. No results were reached in the discussion. Moreover, the copyright dispute over the nationally designated version has not been reasonably resolved according to law. According to the order of the Ministry of Education, those who reprint before the end of June will still be strictly investigated. According to the Copyright Law and the Civil Law, the copyright issue cannot be directly interpreted or confiscated by the education administrative authorities. No matter when they reprint and sell, it is still a criminal act. Therefore, local publishers have sent letters to their counterparts in Shanghai to inquire about the details and temporarily adopt a wait-and-see attitude. In Beijing, the Municipal Education Bureau also convened publishers to discuss, but there were no significant results. As for the powerful Commercial Press, Zhengzhong, Zhonghua, and other companies, they have reached the expiration of their agreements with the Ministry of Education, and they have no absolute obligation to supply them, so their attitude is quite cold. It is expected that this autumn, the Tianjin and Beijing areas will experience an extreme textbook shortage. City Women's Association Scheduled to Hold</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] For this semester's private primary school fee standards, the Municipal Education Bureau has issued a notice to all schools that the total tuition fees collected in one or two installments shall not exceed 120,000 yuan, and the miscellaneous fees shall not exceed 40,000 yuan, for a total maximum amount of 160,000 yuan.

<p>Letter of Correction: Yesterday, I read in your newspaper a piece of news about our school being repeatedly banned by the Ministry of Education, which is slightly different from the actual situation. According to the Ministry of Education, the fact that the Ministry of Education ordered the school to suspend operations because it was not running in accordance with regulations was temporarily resolved by the National Pharmaceutical Industry Association and others on March 17, when representatives were elected to go to Beijing to petition. As a result, officials from various agencies received them and agreed to temporarily allow the school to continue operating on a trial basis, waiting for the Wang authorities to instruct them on improving the direction. Therefore, our school is still adhering to its original intention and continuing classes as usual. The sections reported yesterday were rumors and inaccurate. Please give a correction.

<h3>Basketball Notes</h3>
<p>The Giants fielded their full team last night to compete against Wah Luen for the Mayor's Cup basketball championship. Pi Gu-nai, who had been absent for a long time, also rushed to the court.</p>
<p>At the start, the Giants used Pi Gu-nai as the main center, with the rest of the lineup remaining unchanged, and Gu Fo-lie as a substitute. After a chaotic start, the score was tied at 6-6. The tall Gu Fo-lie replaced Tao Bo-lin-ji, and the Giants formed an all-tall lineup, but still did not gain an advantage. Wah Luen's well-coordinated passing was seamless, which was the main reason for their victory. The two teams were evenly matched under the basket, with the Giants relying on their height, while Wah Luen relied on the efforts of A-di and Da Li for support. The Giants frequently made substitutions, while Wah Luen fought to the end with five players.</p>
<p>Wah Luen led all the way after 4-3. In the second half, the Giants once narrowed the gap to 24-25, thanks to Lao Bao's successful attack under the basket, which stabilized the team's morale. At this time, the Giants made a mistake by replacing Gu Fo-lie with the short Tao, which allowed A-di to score two consecutive goals, sealing the victory.</p>
<p>Fu Ni-shi was steady, and Pi Gu-nai's shooting was unconventional, making them the Giants' two most outstanding players. Gu Fo-lie was restrained by Da Li and faded into obscurity.</p>
<p>In recent games, Lao Bao has been relied upon as the main scorer, and his play under the basket and free throws have been reliable and pleasing. In the all-tall lineup, A-di was still the most active player, while Jin Xue-chong was slightly out of form last night. (Chang Nian)</p>

<h3>National Bank to Issue 10,000 Yuan Notes to Adapt to Needs and Facilitate Payments; Limited Number of Large Denomination Notes in Shanghai Can Only Be Dispatched by Air</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] It is reported that the Central Bank, in response to the request of the Federation of National Banking Associations and to meet social needs, has issued a notice to all banks, money shops, financial institutions, and branches across the country to issue 10,000 yuan national currency notes. The full text of the notice is as follows: "At this National Banking Association Federation meeting in Beijing, based on the opinions of representatives from various regions, and in order to facilitate overseas remittances, promote production, invigorate capital, and facilitate collection and payment, a request was made to issue 10,000 yuan notes. In order to adapt to the above needs, this bank intends to issue them gradually, taking into consideration the situation in various regions. These 10,000 yuan national currency notes are printed by the Central Printing Plant and the China Book Company. Apart from the sample notes, which will be sent separately by letter, this is hereby notified for your information."</p>
<p>It is also learned that Guangzhou, Xi'an, and other places are in urgent need of 10,000 yuan notes due to the influx of overseas remittances and the need to collect cotton. The National Bank has been gradually shipping them for issuance and use. In Shanghai, the current number of large denomination notes is limited, and if needed, only a small number can be dispatched by air.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Tian Fu-jin, Deputy Director of the Issuance Bureau of the Central Bank, commented on the issue of issuing large denomination notes and the price issue. According to Tian, increasing the face value of the notes is by no means equivalent to increasing the amount of currency in circulation. Conversely, not issuing large denomination notes is not proof that the amount of currency is not increasing. Since the issuance of the 500 yuan Customs Gold Unit, 10,000 yuan notes have already been related to the market. Moreover, the issuance of 10,000 yuan notes this time is entirely to meet market needs, so it will not affect prices.</p>
<h3>Commander Xuan Orders Strict Investigation and Prevention; Speculators Confuse the Public with Rumors</h3>
<p>Regarding the Central Bank's upcoming issuance of 10,000 yuan notes, Garrison Commander Xuan Tie-wu ordered his subordinates to pay close attention to investigating and preventing speculators from taking the opportunity to confuse the public with rumors. The original order stated: "The reason for the Central Bank's imminent issuance of 10,000 yuan banknotes is the shortage of funds in the interior, leading to competition for remittances to Shanghai, which has caused exchange rates to rise. Shanghai banks and money shops have requested the issuance for convenience of collection and settlement, and the Central Bank has given it serious consideration. It is believed that the 10,000 yuan banknote is equivalent to the 500 yuan Customs Gold Unit that has already been issued, and the issuance this time is entirely for convenience of collection and settlement, which should not affect price fluctuations. It is feared that speculators will take the opportunity to confuse the public with rumors. Please pay close attention to investigation and prevention."</p>

<p>[Our Reporter] Rong Hong-yuan, General Manager of Shenxin Textile Corporation, told reporters yesterday that in order to increase cotton yarn production and develop China's overseas cotton yarn market, he advocated: (1) Extending the current 10-hour shift system to 11 hours, so that the day and night shifts can operate for 22 hours, and cotton yarn production can be increased accordingly. He said: "Previously, each shift was 12 hours, so the day and night shifts operated for 24 hours completely. Therefore, in terms of the current operating time, production has already been discounted by 80%." (2) Hoping that the government can consider allowing some cotton yarn to be exported, so as to establish China's market overseas. Japan plans to provide 40% of its cotton yarn products for export this year. Therefore, if China's cotton yarn cannot be exported in time, the original market will be seized by Japanese yarn. Moreover, after the export of cotton yarn, it can also earn a sum of foreign exchange for the country, which will also make a considerable contribution to balancing China's international balance of payments.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Orders Local Banks and Shops</h3>
<p>Inter-Dealer Transactions Also Prohibited</p>
<p>In order to prevent domestic funds from escaping to Hong Kong, the Ministry of Finance previously stipulated that travelers from mainland China to Hong Kong or other regions should not carry more than 500,000 yuan of national currency. In order to strictly control this, the Ministry of Finance now stipulates that all banks and money shops across the country should stop handling remittances of national currency to Hong Kong from today. Before approval to resume, all banks and shops across the country must not handle remittances of national currency to Hong Kong. In addition, local banks and shops that accept entrustments from counterparts in Hong Kong and Macau to handle collection and payment business should also be prohibited. After receiving the order, the Central Bank has notified all banks and shops to follow suit.</p>
<h3>Edible Oil Rises Due to Raw Materials</h3>
<p>Since the resumption of distribution in the edible oil market in this city last week, the market price has fallen to below 410,000 yuan, only a few thousand yuan above or below the temporary price of 400,000 yuan stipulated by the city government. In recent days, it has risen again to between 440,000 and 450,000 yuan. The reason for this is still the raw material problem, which has not been reasonably resolved. The government allows the supply of 15,000 tons of soybeans per month, but due to transportation reasons, it cannot solve the urgent need. Currently, each manufacturer relies only on the 4,000 tons of soybeans from the previous CITIC Bureau to maintain the current situation. They are also actively purchasing raw materials and edible oil to supply the market, and hope that the government will expedite assistance. Qingdao oil has risen to 410,000 yuan, which is also the reason for the black market increase compared to the limited price here. Regarding the issue of adjusting the distribution mechanism, the Oil Extraction Industry Association is studying the method and will submit it to the meeting convened by the Social Affairs Bureau for decision.</p>
<h3>Shortage of Raw Materials and Difficulty in Foreign Exchange Settlement Lead to Sharp Decline in Soap and Candle Production</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] According to a survey by the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office, there are a total of 41 members in the Soap and Candle Industry Association of this city. The highest monthly output is 150,000 boxes of laundry soap (47 pounds per box), 30,000 boxes of scented soap (30 pounds per box), 50,000 pounds of glycerin (calculated based on the recovery of glycerin from 100,000 boxes of soap produced each month), and candles have not been manufactured recently. Currently, due to high wages, pressure from usury, heavy taxes, and fierce dumping by foreign merchants in China, coupled with difficulties in importing raw materials and settling foreign exchange, the actual output of each factory is only half of the highest output. If calculated based on the monthly production of 150,000 boxes of laundry soap, then the soap factories in this city need the following raw materials each month: 40,000 piculs of half-oil, 2,000 barrels of bubble alkali (750 pounds per barrel), 1,000 barrels of caustic soda (300 kilograms per barrel), 3,000 piculs of industrial salt, pure alkali (can be omitted if there is caustic soda), 800 tons of coal dust, 10,000 piculs of coconut oil, and 1,100 tons of diesel. Of the above raw materials, caustic soda and coconut oil rely on imports. Although domestic production of caustic soda is slightly available, its output is insufficient, and the export of foreign caustic soda is restricted by the government, and cannot be sold freely, so importers take the opportunity to raise prices, and the highest price per barrel has reached more than 6 million yuan. However, the foreign Xiangmao Soap Factory has easier foreign exchange settlement and lower costs, and domestic soap merchants cannot compete with it. Therefore, the industry hopes that the government will provide a thorough solution to help the industry turn from danger to safety. Dahua Bubble Alkali has sufficient output to meet the needs of this city, but its business is greatly affected due to the dumping of American goods. The industry currently faces two difficulties: (1) Purchase of caustic soda: According to the Industry Association, "If the purchase of caustic soda is difficult, it is proposed that the government try to request Yongli Alkali Factory to supply pure alkali to replace caustic soda. And please ask the Taiwan Administrative Governor's Office's Industrial and Mining Office to provide caustic soda as much as possible to solve the immediate urgent need." (2) Purchase of coconut oil: Coconut oil relies on supply from Southeast Asia, and the industry hopes that the government will allow the settlement of foreign exchange for coconuts to facilitate the production of coconut oil.</p>
<h3>Silk Falls Back</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the artificial silk market was still active and rising in the morning. In the afternoon, rumors of profit-taking entered the market, and many parties took advantage of the high prices to cash out, so it showed a decline. As a result, it leveled with the previous day's price. No. 120 Takayama Yuko opened at 2.8 million yuan, and then shouted up to 3.2 million yuan, with a maximum price of 500,000 yuan, but the buyers stepped back due to the high price, so it still closed at 3 million yuan. In the afternoon, due to rumors of loans and falling stocks, public confidence gradually weakened, and there were only sellers and no buyers, and finally it closed at 2.5 million yuan. The factory sentiment was quite strong in the morning, with D-grade trading at 4 million yuan, and ordinary high-end goods were also priced at 14 million yuan, and dried silk was priced at 10 million yuan, and a single was traded for 1.1 million yuan. In the afternoon, due to the decline in artificial silk, it also softened, and the asking prices for each grade were 200,000 to 300,000 yuan lower. Silk goods have been rising for several days in a row. Yesterday, in addition to Dachen checkered crepe opening at 25,200 yuan in the morning and closing at 5,600 yuan, which was 600 yuan higher than the previous day, the rest were firm and stable with little progress.</p>
<h3>Only Printed Fabrics are Traded in the Cotton Cloth Market</h3>
<p>Although there were transactions in the cotton cloth market yesterday, they were mostly various printed fabrics, because these goods are not within the price limit, and do not conflict with the types stipulated by the economic inspection regulations, so the association allows members to trade on the market. As for various popular goods, such as Longtou fine cloth and Sijunzi serge, the cost of cotton cloth has been stimulated by the soaring black market yarn prices in recent days, and public confidence is strong, and the transaction prices have far exceeded the legal limit. In order to comply with the authorities' intention of stable prices, the association does not allow such illegal transactions in the market. However, according to Yin Xin-yuan, the secretary of the association, "In recent days, the black market price of cotton yarn has soared, and popular fabrics are all processed and copied with 20-count yarn as raw materials. One pound of yarn is woven into one pound of cloth, plus processing, copying, and other labor costs. According to the recent black market yarn prices, the cost of cotton cloth has actually exceeded the legal limit. The association plans to convene a meeting of members to discuss follow-up measures."</p>
<h3>Stabilize Pork Prices; Find Ways to Provide Loans</h3>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Convenes Representatives for Talks</p>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Social Affairs Bureau convened representatives of the pork industry, pig industry, and beef and mutton industry at 3:00 pm yesterday to hold a Fresh Meat Price Evaluation and Limit Committee meeting. The main points of the discussion were: (1) In order to stabilize pork prices, low-interest loans can be provided, and the scope should be universal in principle. (2) The Pork Industry Association and the Fresh Meat Industry Association should prepare a loan plan within five days for review and transfer to financial institutions. (3) After the loan is established, all procurement and distribution information, as well as the agreed prices, should be reported to the competent authorities for verification at any time.</p>
<h3>Anthracite Fine Falls Back</h3>
<p>Anthracite fines initially followed the previous day's rise, and the market prices continued to rise. Kaiping No. 1 fines once reached the 1 million yuan mark. Because the asking price was too high, sellers appeared, and buyers took a wait-and-see attitude. The market suddenly became sluggish, and the market price quickly fell back. However, the result was still higher than the previous market. White coal arrivals were very small, and market prices continued to rise. Jiaozuo lump coal reached a new price of 1.75 million yuan, and Jiangxi Sifangzi white coal, Shantou Meiyuan white coal, etc. also required 1.45 million to 1.5 million yuan. Coke also increased due to the soaring price of anthracite fines, affecting the market situation, and was consistently outstanding.</p>
<h3>Large Batch of Tea Shipped to Europe</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Danish Rinnesmack, chartered by the French postal ship company, left Shanghai for France yesterday afternoon. In addition to the original 8,000 tons of soybeans loaded from Qinhuangdao to Shanghai, it also loaded more than 10,300 boxes of tea for shipment to France.</p>
<h3>Domestic Sales Sluggish</h3>
<p>Various domestic sales teas, which have been hovering for a long time, have gradually sparked the idea of ​​raising prices, but in the end, because actual sales are not strong, the market is still difficult to rise, and the result continues to present a fluctuating situation. The source of Hangzhou New Longjing has been continuous recently, but the quality is getting older, causing the industry to mutually price, tending to the downstream, but public confidence is not discouraged, and the process is clearly falling and secretly stabilizing. Foreign firm tea market: Yutai continues to extract Fuliang black tea from last year, and other varieties are only sporadically opening, and the situation is extremely flat and weak.</p>

<h3>Import Volume is Low, Demand is Urgent: White Paper Prices Repeatedly Rise; Guangzhou Also Purchases from Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] According to industry insiders, the recent increase in white paper prices is due to: (1) insufficient import quotas; (2) urgent demand from other areas; and (3) high black market exchange rates for US dollars. Therefore, prices have risen again recently. Roll white paper has reached a price of 3,000 yuan per pound. Cut white paper has reached 155,000 yuan per ream.</p>
<p>The import quota for white paper from February to April this year, after allocating US$720,000 to the newspaper industry and US$642,000 to the publishing industry, leaves a remaining quota of US$220,000, which is divided among eighteen paper importing firms. The largest receives over 70,000 yuan, and the smallest receives 5,000 yuan. Additionally, there is a quota of US$364,000 for other types of paper, which is distributed among seventy-four importing firms. The largest receives 40,000 yuan, and the smallest receives only 1,000 yuan, highlighting the small size of the allocated quotas. As for purchases from other areas, the northern regions still account for the largest share. However, it is reported that the Guangzhou Transportation Control Commission has recently tightened the issuance of permits, so those in Hankou and along the Yuehan Railway, who previously obtained their paper supplies from Hong Kong, will also shift their purchases to Shanghai.</p>

<h3>A Women's Army is Being Trained: The New Glory of Shandong Women's Movement</h3>
<p>— Jinan, 16th (Airmail Dispatch) — Special Correspondent Li Tian of this Newspaper</p>
<p>Since the victory, more than eight-tenths of Shandong's territory has remained under the "liberation" of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and the remaining areas have been subjected to the "hard fight, soft eat" tactics of the Communist army. It is not difficult to see the hardship of those in charge of the Shandong situation.</p>
<p>Addressing the severe situation in Shandong is not only the responsibility of the government and the men of Shandong. The women of Qi (ancient name for Shandong) are unwilling to lag behind. Under the advocacy and efforts of Yang Baolin, Hu Yichen, and others from the Shandong Women's Movement Association, the saying "Everyone is responsible for the fate of the nation, and every woman is also responsible" has achieved glorious results, washing away the historically attached shame of "singing girls not knowing the sorrow of national subjugation." This is a pioneering initiative in the history of the Chinese women's movement. What women workers throughout the country's provinces and cities should learn from is the Shandong Women's Movement Association's training of Shandong women.</p>
<p>Shandong Women's Movement Association Unwilling to Lag Behind</p>
<p>Around this time last year, Shandong was affected by the truce agreement, and government troops were strictly prohibited from moving north. The National Army's forces in Jinan were so thin that it was unimaginable. Wang Yaowu recognized the importance of the people's self-defense forces and organized the People's Self-Defense Headquarters, first training 267,973 people in the provincial capital within three months. The Shandong Women's Movement Association, unwilling to lag behind, actively cooperated with the People's Self-Defense Headquarters to establish a women's group, training 33,000 women soldiers.</p>
<p>The training method involved organizing women in the provincial capital, aged between eighteen and thirty-five, into teams for training. Ordinary women, including female shop assistants, female barbers, and female waitresses, were organized into detachments, brigades, and companies based on their districts and neighborhoods. As for female opera singers, prostitutes, and others, they were organized into direct-affiliated brigades by the headquarters for training. Female factory workers, female clerks, and female public school teachers and female students from various agencies and schools were self-organized and trained by their original agencies and schools, with personnel assigned by the women's group of the headquarters to guide and coach. The training subjects included not only military subjects but also emphasized political training and covered nursing, first aid, childcare, sewing, cleaning, investigation, organization, training, and propaganda. To reduce practical difficulties during training, the following were exempted from training: (1) those with children under three years old who have no one else to care for them; (2) those who are sick or have bound feet and difficulty moving; (3) pregnant women who are five months or more along; and (4) housewives who are solely responsible for their families and cannot leave home.</p>
<p>Grand Procession, Spirits Soaring</p>
<p>Before the general women's training, to facilitate the smooth progress of the training, 537 women with junior high school or normal school education or above were first selected from the reported trainees for short-term cadre training. These cadres were then assigned to various districts and neighborhoods to conduct general village women's training. During the training period, although some city residents opposed women's training due to backward thinking, and the Communist Party took the opportunity to spread rumors, claiming that "women's training is to prepare for the comfort of soldiers," a small number of women inevitably fled and waited to see. However, the vast majority of women actively participated, humbly receiving instruction, and requested to participate in investigation, propaganda, comfort, and other work after training. After ten days of training, during the review held at the provincial stadium outside Nanwei Gate, the 36,000 neatly marching, energetic women soldiers formed a grand procession, which not only shone brightly in the national women's movement but also, in the overall people's self-defense training in the province, achieved outstanding results worthy of recognition. When the brigade passed in front of the reviewing stand, Director of Education Yang Baolin led the shout "Long Live Women's Liberation," and 36,000 people responded in unison, shaking the Lu River, even the famous Thousand Buddha Mountain on the outskirts of Jinan seemed to echo in response.</p>
<p>The review results showed that the factories, schools, and railway bureau achieved the best results, while the performance of government officials was the worst. Surprisingly, the performance of the prostitute brigade ranked second overall, which deserves attention. According to investigations, this was because they were the most obedient and had the greatest ambition, which is why they were able to achieve such high results.</p>
<p>This women's training organization is still maintained and has further divided the original eleven detachments and nine directly affiliated brigades into five specialized groups for propaganda, organization, training, investigation, first aid, and comfort, convening and training personnel twice each. At the spring grand exercises held some time ago, these middle-aged women showed significant progress compared to their training last year. Undoubtedly, their growth has brought considerable and indelible stability to the overall situation in Shandong, which has been plagued by constant rain and especially to the once isolated city of Jinan.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the Shandong Women's Movement Association has two other great achievements: (1) the establishment of the Shandong Martyrs' Dependents School, which has recently accommodated more than 600 children of martyrs who died in the War of Resistance, divided into six elementary school classes and five junior and senior high school classes. All student accommodation, clothing, books, and other expenses are borne by the school. (2) The promotion of comfort work: During the emergency in Jinan at the beginning of last month, it completed a fundraising campaign of 1 billion yuan and 200,000 pairs of shoes and socks within half a month.</p>
<p>Other activities such as women's literacy classes, women's clinics, women's cooperatives, women's welfare service agencies, Zuomin nurseries, Siyuan kindergartens, as well as relief for all oppressed women and mediation of oppressed women and their family disputes are all unfolding vigorously and have achieved significant results worthy of observation and imitation. In Shandong, as of now, can you find any social group that is more active than the Women's Movement Association? Which has shown more performance in its work? Undoubtedly, Shandong women are not only burying themselves in action to fight for their own liberation but are also acting to benefit the country and its people.</p>

<h3>New German Invention: Bitter Chestnuts Save from Hardship; Streets Full of Money Trees, Ensuring Food, Clothing, and Warmth</h3>
<p>— 6th (Airmail Dispatch) — Special Correspondent Wang Ren, Writing from Leiden</p>
<p>Germany experienced a long and severe winter last year, suffering from hunger and cold to the extreme. German scholars, relying on the power of science, turned waste into treasure and skillfully seized nature's secrets, opening up a wonderful solution: the latest invention of "bitter chestnuts saving from hardship."</p>
<p>The method involves obtaining raw materials from the bitter chestnuts that are discarded and useless throughout the streets in autumn, the spherical cupules covered in prickles, to enrich people's livelihoods. Not only can they be eaten, but they can also be worn. A kind of street decoration tree used to show off appearance has suddenly transformed into a money tree that provides both clothing and food.</p>
<p>The chestnut is a deciduous tree that grows wild in the mountains, reaching over five zhang (approx. 16 meters) in height. The leaves are alternately arranged, sharp and long like lance leaves, with sharp serrated edges. In Western Europe, male and female flowers bloom in May. Male flowers are arranged in long spikes, while female flowers often grow in clusters of three. The flower color is nearly white, with red ones being particularly beautiful. When the flowers bloom, they are supported by leaves, resembling thousands of red candles from a distance. A courtyard in a valley, mountain market town can represent the beauty of spring in Germany, no less than the peach blossoms of China or the cherry blossoms of Japan.</p>
<p>The chestnuts on the European continent are divided into two types: sweet and bitter. The sweet ones are known as Sweet Chestnut in English and Marron in French. The Guihua (sweet osmanthus) chestnut of West Lake in China is a delicacy, which is a sweet chestnut. Honey-glazed sweet chestnuts from southern France are world-renowned; we in China can imitate this practice. The bitter ones are simply called Chestnut in Latin, English, and French. Bitter chestnuts are inedible or used to feed horses. They should be called "bitter chestnuts" in Chinese to distinguish them from sweet chestnuts.</p>
<p>On my thirty-sixth birthday, I went on a spring outing with companions, and I composed a poem inspired by the scenery, which deeply reflects the joy of spring in Germany. I transcribe it below: "Singing and playing music, we hurry along, a small group of birds face the wind. (In German, 'birds' refers to boy and girl scouts who are skilled at singing. The fairy music drifts in the wind; don't waste the spring, youth is enchanting). The wild shop is full of people drinking coffee, chestnut flowers red in the green courtyard." (This chestnut is the bitter chestnut).</p>
<p>Now, German scholars have discovered that the nutrients contained in "bitter chestnuts" are even more abundant than those in soybean foods, which are vigorously advocated by my Chinese scientific leader Li Gaoyang (Shi Zeng): (1) Dried chestnuts can be ground into flour, removing the bitterness to produce high-quality white flour. (2) A milk substitute can be made, comparable to Chinese tofu juice. Most beautifully, bitterness can be removed from bitter chestnuts to make ice cream. (3) Artificial wool made from bitter chestnuts can keep out the cold. (4) A holy medicine for treating intestinal diseases can be extracted.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Shakespeare in England</h3>
<p>— Cao Weifeng</p>
<p>Although Shakespeare was English, in literature, especially in drama, he already belongs to all of humanity. Great artists are always like this because the subjects they deal with are not people of a specific country or era but the entirety of humanity, the essence of human nature; they not only transcend space but also transcend time. During this great war, Shakespeare's plays were heavily performed in the United States. Not only that, but military theater troupes at the front lines also had several Shakespearean productions. The performance of black democratic actor Robeson in war relief performances was extremely fitting.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's enthusiasm for Shakespeare is unmatched by any other country. Theaters throughout the Soviet Union stage Shakespeare's works on a large scale every spring. According to the sales of translations, at least millions of Soviet people have seen Shakespeare's works. This is not only because the Soviet people respect Shakespeare but also enough to prove the cultivation of their people's literature and art.</p>
<p>We have long been accustomed to hearing and reading words and texts praising Shakespeare. His aphorisms, the archetypes he created, have been constantly quoted for centuries. I have always advocated adopting a critical attitude towards Shakespeare's evaluation, but because his works are numerous, the range he deals with is wide, and the texts discussing his work can truly fill volumes, although I have been engaged in translating his works for fifteen or sixteen years, I have never dared to start writing criticisms of him.</p>
<p>In England today, Shakespearean studies are also regarded by scholars as a daunting task. Although there are not few people researching, and even during the war, several specialized books are published every year, scholars who can achieve great success and works of profound depth have not been seen for more than a decade.</p>
<p>However, the British have not forgotten Shakespeare. London stages repeat performances of Shakespeare's plays every year. In addition, there is a grand performance of Shakespeare's works at the memorial theater in Shakespeare's hometown around Shakespeare's birthday every year. This year, April 23rd is the 383rd anniversary of Shakespeare's birth and the 331st anniversary of his death. At this time in England, on the banks of the Avon River, in Shakespeare's hometown town, it must be extraordinarily lively.</p>
<p>I have a program leaflet from the 1938 Shakespeare festival. The scale of that drama festival can be considered quite large. It started on April 3rd and ended on September 23rd. During this period, Shakespeare's works were performed for a full twenty-five weeks. For people who study Shakespeare, attending such a drama festival once can be very beneficial. Although I was in England that year, I couldn't afford to see a play, and I still regret it every time I think about it.</p>
<p>That performance was divided into two parts, the first part lasted twelve weeks and performed eight plays in total:</p>
<p>1. As You Like It 13 times</p>
<p>2. Twelfth Night 12 times</p>
<p>3. Othello 14 times</p>
<p>4. The Taming of the Shrew 13 times</p>
<p>5. Richard III 13 times</p>
<p>6. The Comedy of Errors 11 times</p>
<p>7. Much Ado About Nothing 11 times</p>
<p>8. Coriolanus 9 times</p>
<p>There were a total of ninety-six performances, six days a week—no performances on Sundays—averaging eight performances per week. The second part of the program also included eight plays, including "The Merchant of Venice" and "Hamlet." There are several famous actors in England who specialize in performing Shakespeare's plays. They live near the town of Stratford and only participate in performances during this festival every year.</p>
<p>These audiences can be said to come from all over the world. British audiences, apart from students, do not occupy an important position. In the town of Stratford, the Shakespeare Memorial Theater is the center of the entire town. Foreigners who come to visit and people who admire Shakespeare flock there year-round. During the theater festival, there are even more tourists. Railway companies add special trains, and long-distance buses increase their schedules, all for the sake of watching Shakespeare's plays.</p>
<p>Shakespeare wrote a total of thirty-seven plays in his lifetime, as well as a book of sonnets and several long poems. Among these thirty-seven plays, several are extremely difficult to perform. For example, "King Lear" is a very difficult play to perform, and it is usually only staged once every two or three years. In terms of comedy, "The Tempest" is also rarely performed.</p>
<p>Even so, some of his other plays are not only often performed but also enthusiastically appreciated by audiences, day after day for centuries. "As You Like It," "The Merchant of Venice," "Hamlet," "A Midsummer Night's Dream," "Othello," and "Romeo and Juliet" are all plays that are revived on European and American stages every year.</p>
<p>Among English-speaking nations, Shakespeare's works are also regarded as a kind of test for actors. It goes without saying that their schoolchildren must read some Shakespeare because he is the best author. In addition, if their young people want to pursue acting, playing a role in Shakespeare's works is a necessary stage. There are several characters in Shakespeare's plays, male characters such as the Jewish character Shylock in "The Merchant of Venice," Richard III, Romeo, and Hamlet; female characters such as Juliet, Lady Macbeth, and Rosaline in "As You Like It," all are characters that a successful actor must portray.</p>
<p>I don't know when I will be able to introduce Shakespeare's true face to the Chinese stage and show it to Chinese audiences. Adaptation is by no means the right path; learning from films produced by Hollywood is also not a solution. I have seen several Shakespearean films from Hollywood: "Romeo and Juliet," "As You Like It," "A Midsummer Night's Dream," "The Taming of the Shrew," and "Henry V." Only "Henry V" is somewhat better; the others are too Americanized. Unfortunately, Chinese people don't easily appreciate the play "Henry V."</p>
<p>I believe that Shakespeare's plays have the potential to succeed when performed in China. My translation is for students to read. If it is for performance, it can be changed into colloquial language. I hope that the domestic situation can stabilize and literary activities can become lively again. That way, we might also be able to introduce Shakespeare once and perform "Hamlet."</p>
<h3>Shakespeare</h3>
<p>— Jia Hua</p>
<p>Shakespeare is the world's greatest playwright. Although he was a figure of the Elizabethan era in the sixteenth century, because he left us many glorious masterpieces, even though more than three hundred years have passed, he remains a bright bud in the history of world literature.</p>
<p>Literary critic Soroli哀 said, "As soon as we hear Shakespeare, we already get a grand concept" (Comparative Literary History). Professor Wilson Knight also praised, "William Shakespeare is indeed the greatest writer in the history of world literature."</p>
<h3>Shakespeare's Portrait</h3>
<p>— British M. Droeshout</p>
<h3>Shakespeare's Works</h3>
<p>— Feng Li</p>
<p>Shakespeare wrote thirty-six plays. At the time, his plays were not printed for readers to read; they were only performed on stage. When Shakespeare died, drafts of twenty-one plays were found in various theaters. Others were printed as quarto books, which were printed with Shakespeare's permission. Most of the plays were recorded by listeners in the theater, and some publishers secretly printed them for their own benefit. The first collection of Shakespeare's plays was called the First Folio, which was edited by two actors, Heming and Condell.</p>
<p>Shakespeare's plays can be divided into five periods based on the progress of his life and experience.</p>
<p>(1) Early Experimental Period</p>
<p>The early works express youth and imagination.</p>
<p>Shakespeare began his writing by imitating old plays and writing "Henry VI." After that, he imitated Marlowe's style and wrote "Titus Andronicus," imitating "Love's Labour's Lost." Imitating the Latin comedy "Menaechmi" by Plantus (Mantus), he wrote "The Comedy of Errors." The representative works of Shakespeare's first period are "Two Gentlemen of Verona," "A Midsummer Night's Dream," and "Romeo and Juliet." In these plays, we see Shakespeare's writing making rapid progress.</p>
<p>(2) English Historical Play Period</p>
<p>After the age of thirty, Shakespeare began to write historical plays: "Richard III," "Richard II," "King John," "Henry IV," and "Henry V." The historical materials and anecdotes in these plays are mostly taken from Holinshed's "Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland." During this period, Shakespeare also produced some comedic reliefs, such as "Falstaff."</p>
<p>(3) "The Merchant of Venice" and the Merry Comedy Period</p>
<p>The plays of this period are: "The Taming of the Shrew," "The Merry Wives of Windsor," "The Merchant of Venice," and "As You Like It." After finishing "The Merchant of Venice," Shakespeare changed his style, and his works became serious and melancholy. "Twelfth Night" is the last of Shakespeare's comedies. Shakespeare wrote sonnets. His sonnets were published in 1609.</p>
<p>(4) Melancholy Period</p>
<p>Shakespeare wrote Roman plays: "Julius Caesar," "Coriolanus," and "Antony and Cleopatra." After completing the Roman plays, Shakespeare began to write comedies again, but he wrote bitter comedies, such as "Measure for Measure" and "Troilus and Cressida." Later, Shakespeare wrote four great tragedies: "Hamlet," "Othello," "Macbeth," and "King Lear." The last tragedy was "Timon of Athens." After that, Shakespeare no longer wrote tragedies.</p>
<p>(5) Pure Romantic Period</p>
<p>The plays of this period are full of mysterious and composed spirits, expressing Shakespeare's late literary works. "Cymbeline," "The Winter's Tale," and "The Tempest" are his best plays of his later years. "The Tempest" was written for the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and the Prince Palatine in 1613. "The Tempest" shows Shakespeare's new character. The charm of "A Midsummer Night's Dream," the passion of "Romeo and Juliet," the humor of "Falstaff," and the heroism of "King Lear" are all gathered in "The Tempest," which is Shakespeare's last artistic work.</p>
<h3>Shakespeare Sonnet 109</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zhen Qin</p>
<p>O, never say that I was false of heart,</p>
<p>Though absence seemed my flame to qualify.</p>
<p>As easy might I from myself depart</p>
<p>As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie.</p>
<p>That is my home of love: if I have ranged,</p>
<p>Like him that travels I return again;</p>
<p>Just to the time, not with the time exchanged, --</p>
<p>So that myself bring water for my stain.</p>
<p>Never believe, though in my nature reigned</p>
<p>All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,</p>
<p>That it could so preposterously be stained</p>
<p>To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;</p>
<p>For nothing this wide universe I call,</p>
<p>Save thou, my rose; in it thou art my all.</p>
<h3>The Tragedy of Hesitation</h3>
<p>— Yan Zhewu</p>
<p>——To be or not to be, that's the question.</p>
<p>This is the famous soliloquy from Shakespeare's masterpiece "Hamlet," which clearly represents the feelings of hesitant young people suffering in this era, forming a tragic drama of character! The gist of that famous line is:</p>
<p>"To be, or not to be—that is the question:</p>
<p>Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer</p>
<p>The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,</p>
<p>Or to take arms against a sea of troubles</p>
<p>And by opposing end them. To die—to sleep—</p>
<p>No more; and by a sleep to say we end</p>
<p>The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks</p>
<p>That flesh is heir to; 'tis a consummation</p>
<p>Devoutly to be wish'd. To die—to sleep.</p>
<p>To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub!</p>
<p>For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,</p>
<p>When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,</p>
<p>Must give us pause—there's the respect</p>
<p>That makes calamity of so long life.</p>
<p>For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,</p>
<p>Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,</p>
<p>The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,</p>
<p>The insolence of office, and the spurns</p>
<p>That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,</p>
<p>When he himself might his quietus make</p>
<p>With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,</p>
<p>To grunt and sweat under a weary life,</p>
<p>But that the dread of something after death,</p>
<p>The undiscover'd country from whose bourn</p>
<p>No traveller returns, puzzles the will,</p>
<p>And makes us rather bear those ills we have</p>
<p>Than fly to others that we know not of?</p>
<p>Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,</p>
<p>And thus the native hue of resolution</p>
<p>Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,</p>
<p>And enterprises of great pitch and moment</p>
<p>With this regard their currents turn awry</p>
<p>And lose the name of action…"</p>
<p>From Hamlet's beautiful lines of "thinking before acting," we see a kind of life's distress, societal distress, and era's distress, which is why a tragedy of character is produced! This tragedy has its own background, but the tormented thoughts of the sixteenth century still linger in the minds of people in the present era!</p>
<p>To do or not to do? Ascend to heaven or descend to hell? Active or passive? Moral or beneficial? Asceticism or enjoyment? Lofty or simple? Conservative or innovative? – To live or to die?... These uncertain thoughts constantly impact nerves, and people in this transforming era also produce uncertain characters. Especially intellectuals, many are immersed in the "Hamlet type"!</p>
<p>In England, the era Shakespeare encountered was a transitional period of rapid change where the feudal system was declining, the aristocracy was degenerating, the power of royal rule was expanding, commercial capitalism was rising, all old views had collapsed, and new morals had not yet been established. Therefore, people's beliefs in life were also shaken, in a state of doubt, hesitation, and indecision, suffering, lamenting, and even experiencing the sadness of disappointment.</p>
<p>In China, the current era, society, and life we are experiencing are like Shakespeare's time in England, and as he thought in his heart and described in his writing. Everything is in distress! Precisely because we hold new aspirations, but still retain lingering memories of the past, we create a character tragedy of "not being able to be a good person completely, nor being able to be a bad person thoroughly," and we often become the protagonists of this tragedy.</p>
<p>"Thinking before acting" is certainly considerate, but if one thinks too much before doing anything, one will inevitably make mistakes. People with ambition should adopt a "resolute" attitude in this chaotic society, recognize the truth, and not drift with the tide? Firm in will, it does no harm to act according to one's own convictions. Otherwise, looking back on the past and thinking about the present, we will not escape Shakespeare's pen, and will only create more Hamlets and evolve more tragedies of character!</p>
<p>Commemorating Shakespeare's birthday, I remembered that immortal famous line. And from the distress of the transitional era, I am even more alert to avoid falling into the abyss of "hesitation," and should raise the fighting and firm sails, and navigate the turbulent waves of the disconnect between the old and the new in that transitional period!</p>
<h3>This Year's Shakespeare Drama Festival in England</h3>
<p>— English: Trovick</p>
<p>The head of the Shakespeare Drama Festival, Jackson, recently announced various plans for Shakespeare in 1947.</p>
<p>This year, these two festivals will last for twenty-five weeks, which can be regarded as the most outstanding since its establishment in 1879.</p>
<p>The cast of this year's performance has fifty actors, led by Bitlerix, Lyman and Robert Tuo, and Hailis. There are nine plays to be performed, eight of which are Shakespeare's plays, and the ninth is Marlowe's "Doctor Faustus."</p>
<p>The Shakespeare Drama Festival opened on April 5, with the first performance of "Romeo and Juliet," with Lawrence and Penny playing Romeo and Daphne, Slater playing Juliet, and Bilerix. Lyman plays the nanny.</p>
<p>This performance is very noteworthy because Jackson entrusted the play to twenty-one-year-old Peter Brook based on his bold experience.</p>
<p>To celebrate Shakespeare's birthday on April 23, "Twelfth Night" will be staged. The commemorative ceremony will be held at noon in the style of the "International Flag". At noon, a bugle will be blown, and the national flags of forty countries will be unfurled by their representatives.</p>
<p>It is expected that many ambassadors and high officials will participate today, lined up to visit Shakespeare's birthplace and his tomb. Afterwards, a public banquet will be held, presided over by Sir Monin, President of the Royal Society.</p>
<p>Other Shakespeare plays to be performed this year include "Love's Labour's Lost", "The Tempest", "Richard II", "The Merchant of Venice" and "Prince of Tyre".</p>
<p>Another feature of this year's drama festival is a series of public lectures, hosted by the custodians of the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre and the British Cultural Committee. These speakers will critique the plays seen on stage during a week.</p>
<p>All scholars studying Shakespeare will also hold an international conference from April 17 to 27. (Special article from the British News Agency)</p>
<h3>Shakespeare's Life</h3>
<p>— Xu Xinqin</p>
<p>Shakespeare's life was truly one of simple living to clarify his ambitions and tranquility to achieve far-reaching goals. He never flaunted sectarian views, and although his talents were multifaceted, he did not seek fame or fortune and ignored rights and interests. Throughout his life, he devoted himself to contributing to cultural undertakings. As the son of a country gentleman, he still regarded himself as a country gentleman. His historical dramas can almost be regarded as reliable British history by the world, but the palace crimes and political conspiracies he exposed were not biased preferences, propaganda, or slander. He purely stood on the position of loving the country and the nation, and wrote with passionate emotions and artistic skills in a quick hand, making Spring and Autumn-style criticisms and commendations. Here we can see that the art of the great house is truly immortal!</p>
<h3>Shakespeare's Fourteen Poems</h3>
<p>— Zhen Qin</p>
<p>Do not despise the sonnet; critics, listen...Shakespeare used it as a key to open his heart…</p>
<p>——Wordsworth: Sonnets</p>
<p>Shakespeare (born in 1564, died in 1616) was a great writer of the Elizabethan era in England, and can also be said to be the greatest playwright of ancient and modern times. However, his value was not truly recognized by the world until the nineteenth century. After being promoted and magnified by Lessing in Germany and Coleridge in England, Shakespeare's position in literature became supreme. In the seventeenth century, Milton only called Shakespeare:</p>
<p>…Sweetest Shakespeare, Fancy's child,</p>
<p>Warbling his native wood-notes wild,—</p>
<p>—Milton: L'Allegro.</p>
<p>However, by the middle of the nineteenth century, Arnold was already shouting:</p>
<p>…Others abide our question. Thou art free.</p>
<p>We ask and ask—Thou smilest and art still,</p>
<p>Out-topping knowledge…</p>
<p>—Arnold: Shakespeare</p>
<p>However, Shakespeare's plays were still noticed and performed from time to time before the nineteenth century, but his collection of sonnets was basically ignored until the nineteenth century. Once someone paid attention to it, everyone discovered the extraordinary beauty of this collection of poems, and recognized that Shakespeare occupied the same high position in the history of lyric poetry development as he did in the history of drama development.</p>
<p>The reason why this collection of sonnets has become a treasure of the art world is not only because they are exquisite works of art, but also because they tell Shakespeare's inner feelings. Shakespeare, as the greatest writer of ancient and modern times, left us a blank personal history; we can be familiar with the biography of a third-rate writer in the nineteenth century a hundred times more detailed than Shakespeare's, which is a cruel game of history. But fortunately, we have this valuable collection of sonnets, from which we roughly know an important event in Shakespeare's life. The collection contains a total of one hundred and fifty-two sonnets, which can be divided into two series. The first series, from the first to the one hundred and twenty-sixth, is the expression of love to a beautiful young man, continuous, euphemistic, tortuous, poignant, and moving. The second series, from the one hundred and twenty-seventh to the one hundred and fifty-second, is sent to a black-eyed, black-haired "dark lady," expressing passionate and crazy love. Some people say that these poems are just Shakespeare using his own pen to express the feelings of others, just like the dialogues of the characters in his plays, but it is really incomprehensible that such critics cannot delve into the spirit of the works and only make superficial judgments. It is very obvious that these poems are not deliberately created stories but the poet's unconscious and true confession. However, for hundreds of years, critics and textual researchers have competed to explain the background of these poems, such as who the beautiful young man is and whether Shakespeare was a homosexual with him, which is a good scene to watch, but it does not affect the value of these poems themselves.</p>
<p>The form of the sonnet was introduced to England by Wyatt and Surrey in the early sixteenth century. Its rhythm is iambic, with five feet in each line, so it is a pentameter poem. The whole poem has fourteen lines, and the rules of reading feet, the original Italian form, such as that used by Petrarch, is like this:</p>
<p>abba abba cdc dcd</p>
<p>Wyatt's and Surrey's sonnets often have changes, while Shakespeare's sonnets are uniform:</p>
<p>abab cdcd efef gg</p>
<p>Later, all sonnets written in accordance with this rhyme foot rule are called Shakespearean or English, because it is different from the classical or Petrarchan Italian style, and also different from those written by other English poets at the same time as Shakespeare, such as Spenser, who has Spenserian sonnets. But Shakespeare's rhyme foot rule was not created by him. Surrey had used it long ago, and the earliest sonnet writer also used this form.</p>
<p>The so-called sonnet is commonly called Sonnet in English, pronounced "Sonnet", so some people transliterate it as "Shang Lai Style", but in English it can also be called Sonata, the name is the same as the sonata in music or "Lock That". It was originally prepared to be written for singing, so it can be regarded as a kind of lyric poem; but the technique is somewhat dramatic: the concept is introduced in the first four lines, the ups and downs are twisted and entangled in the second and third quatrains, and a clear or abrupt ending is made in the final couplet. The sonnet occupies a very important position in English poetry, although it is a foreign poetic form. Wyatt and Surrey are introducers, Shakespeare is the completer, others such as Spenser, Milton, Wordsworth in the nineteenth century, Keats, E.B. Browning and modern Mascfield and others have rarely seen sonnets after they rose up in poetry.</p>
<p>It seems that there are very few people in our country who introduce Shakespeare's sonnets. With my limited knowledge, I only know three: Mr. Liang Guochun's English-Chinese bilingual "Selected English Poems" translated six poems in Chinese prose, Mr. Liang Zongdai translated several poems, which were published in Mr. Zhu Guangqian's "Literary Magazine" before the war, and in the Xuesheng in wartime Shibao, in addition, there is only one poem in Mr. Li Yuenan's translation collection "Serenade" recently published, but fortunately, it can be regarded as not being translated wrong. Mr. Cao Weifeng has translated the complete works of Shakespeare, and has published many plays, and the collection of sonnets is also listed as one of the complete works, but it has not yet been published, which inevitably makes readers anxious. I have always loved Shakespeare's sonnets, and with the gift of a friend, I obtained a version of Shakespeare's sonnets with notes and a long preface by Ms. Stopes, and I read it in my spare time. I have also occasionally translated several poems when I have nothing to do during my illness.</p>

<h3>Elementary School Teacher Jumps Off Building</h3>
<p>— Yue Feng</p>
<p>According to the report, an elementary school teacher named Yu Jingshan committed suicide by jumping off a building the night before last. It is actually wrong to call an elementary school teacher jumping off a building, because when he jumped off the building, he was no longer a teacher, but a servant of a certain clothing company. However, newspaper reporters insisted on emphasizing that he had previously served as an elementary school teacher, and wanted to say that the two suicide notes he left behind were written in a very beautiful style, etc.</p>
<p>The reason for the suicide was that the income was meager and it was difficult to support the family. It can be seen that although he had a beautiful writing style and had been a teacher, it did not help his income. I am afraid that it not only did not help, but also hindered it somewhat. People who have been teachers for a long time always have a bit of lofty arrogance. They have never observed people's expressions and are unwilling to serve others. They only take a fixed salary every month and do not expect any generous rewards or extra money. Therefore, this young man who changed from elementary school teaching to a servant could not increase his income and it was difficult to support his family. Therefore, he could not help but end his life automatically out of anger.</p>
<p>The problem lies in this anger, just as the newspaper headline said that he "degenerated" into a servant. He probably felt that this change of career was a loss of status. Those who have lowered their status but still cannot make the family full of food cannot help but feel angry. He was wrong.</p>
<p>"Don't take off the long gown, the ancestors have accumulated virtue," this is the feudal thinking of the past. Why is it that wearing a long gown is one level higher than wearing short clothes? There is no reason to say this in modern society. Unfortunately, we, the people who wear long gowns, cannot get rid of this kind of thinking, and always work our minds on this side and do not move our hands. Many people would rather die wearing long gowns and refuse to take them off. In spirit, they can be regarded as victorious. The bad thing is that most people have a chasm, but they are forced to cross the chasm to the other side. When jumping, they lack the courage to move forward, their feet move forward, but their heads look back behind them. It is a miracle to fall into the river like this.</p>
<h3>Overpopulation</h3>
<p>— Meng Ping</p>
<p>When mentioning China's population figures, everyone will answer without thinking, 450 million people. Whether it is 400 million or 450 million, or 470 million, no one can give a definite answer because there are no accurate statistics.</p>
<p>The Donghua Records record that in 1741 (the sixth year of Qianlong), China's population was 143.41 million; in 1841 (the twenty-first year of Daoguang), it was 413.45 million; in 1873 (the twelfth year of Tongzhi), it was 477.13 million. From 1741 to 1841, a century apart, the population increased by 270 million, which is about three times. Based on this speculation, from the first year of the Republic of China to the thirty-sixth year, although there were eight years of the Anti-Japanese War and years of civil strife, and deaths were rampant, it can be asserted that the population has increased without decreasing.</p>
<p>The Japanese Fujiwara Sadato's paper, "The Phenomena of Overpopulation at the End of the Qing Dynasty and the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement" records that the increase rate of cultivated land, assuming it was 100 in 1724 (the second year of Yongzheng), was 133 in 1887 (the thirteenth year of Guangxu). Although the cultivated land area increased, compared with the above-mentioned population increase rate, the relevant multiple is very small.</p>
<p>Population growth has created the phenomenon of overpopulation. Zhang Xiaoming and Fujiwara Sadato discussed that the reason for the outbreak of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution was caused by overpopulation. China is a country established by agriculture, and the way to solve overpopulation is first, the government implements relief, and second, the people seek their own survival. Government relief means developing industry, improving agricultural production, and reclaiming sandy land and wasteland. The people seek their own survival, that is, they move abroad and become beggars and bandits, so-called strong people scattered in all directions, and the strong take risks.</p>
<p>Shanghai has a population of 3.89 million, and according to newspaper reports, more than half of them are unemployed. The future crisis is unimaginable. How to reduce the number of unemployed people? How to solve the problem of overpopulation? The fundamental policy should be considered as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Speaking of Riddles</h3>
<p>— Zhao Chun</p>
<p>A writer's pen can do everything, in addition to essays and poems, riddles are also one of them. I love the one made by Baoyu in Dream of the Red Chamber the most. The answer is a mirror, and the riddle face collects the four books and says: "Sitting facing south, facing north to worship, like sorrow is also sorrow, like joy is also joy." The generosity of the words and the naturalness of the tone are unprecedented. Thinking carefully about these four words, if they were specially designed for this riddle, wouldn't it be strange!</p>
<p>Recently, at a banquet, a friend described that after Empress Dowager Cixi returned to the capital in the year of Xin Chou, during the Lantern Festival in the year of Ren Yin, she made a riddle herself. The face was four more characters, and the answer was two summer calendar festivals, but she specified that they were not the twenty-four solar terms such as Qingming Guyu, etc., and hung it on the lantern. From the lighting of the lantern on the thirteenth night to the extinguishing of the lantern on the eighteenth day, no one in the palace guessed it in five days. After the Lantern Festival, it was shown to the two Shuyi (i.e., the South Study and the Upper Study) Hanlin, but they all failed to guess it. Finally, Cixi herself announced that it was the two nouns "New Year's Eve" and "Qixi Festival". The difficulty of guessing this riddle is that what is written is four more characters, and people are all thinking about more characters, so it is not easy to guess. If it is written as eight evening characters, then removing one evening is Qixi Festival, which can be known at a glance. Cixi is also cunning. With this cleverness, but the Qing Dynasty collapsed after the Gengzi Incident, it can also be said that he was clever for a lifetime.</p>
<h3>"Xue Pinggui"</h3>
<p>— Qi Feng</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, General Xue Boling (Yue) concurrently managed the Xiang government as commander of the war zone. At that time, prices in Changsha, Hengyang and other places fluctuated extremely violently. Xue first created an evaluation meeting to try to stabilize them. Who knew that holding a meeting to evaluate once was equivalent to acknowledging that the price had legally increased once. As a result, the market storm became more and more out of control. The people of Hunan ridiculed this kind of work as "Xue Pinggui", because Xue's suppression of prices became more and more expensive. It can be seen that General Xue, who won three victories in three battles in northern Hunan and played with the Japanese invaders in the palm of his hand, was helpless against the all-powerful merchants.</p>
<p>Today's situation in Shanghai is also the same. The so-called evaluation meeting has almost become a legislative body for merchants to raise prices. Taking white rice as an example, as late as January of this year, it was only sold for 78,000 yuan per dan. In the gold rush in early February, the official price was adjusted to more than 100,000 yuan due to accepting the rice merchants' reason of "rising prices in the place of origin", retroactively recognizing an increase rate of 30%. At the beginning of this month, capital shifted from the securities market to daily necessities, and prices fluctuated again. Therefore, the official price of white rice was adjusted to more than 120,000 yuan again.</p>
<p>The authorities are meticulous in their concern for the difficulties of merchants, but merchants have never shown any consideration for the common people. At the moment, the price of high-grade white rice is about 20 yuan per dan, and the common people dream of the official limit price of more than 120,000 yuan but cannot get it. Thinking of this, it is heartbreaking. The saying goes: "Govern a chaotic world with severe punishments." Today, seeking a reasonable evaluation is tantamount to seeking a tiger's skin.</p>
<h3>Lessons of a Football Game</h3>
<p>— Zhang Jusun</p>
<p>The Seoul team had a good start in their first game in Shanghai, easily defeating the Soviet Union 2-1. Their superb football skills are admirable.</p>
<p>However, in the second battle, the record was set within twelve hours, really like becoming Bonaparte, Napoleon, and losing 2-0 at "Waterloo." It is said that because they were underestimating the enemy, they started with reserve members. After losing two goals in a row, they urgently transferred the regular army to play, but unfortunately the situation was beyond repair. It is really "a wrong step leaves a regret for thousands of years."</p>
<p>(The Seoul team easily defeated the Czech flag in three battles. Are they better than us? Editor).</p>
<p>We do not despise the railway's football skills, but we cannot help but feel something about the passenger car's defeat this time. If we use our country's popular history as a metaphor, we can only say "carelessness loses Jingzhou."</p>
<p>Let's look at the United Press's telegraph: Washington Post sports editor and National Sports Writers and Broadcasters Association President Hanbus announced that the American Celebrity Golf Tournament will be held here at the Columbia Club on May 17th and 18th. Low-pitched singer Bing Crosby will partner with Senate Policy Committee Chairman Taft, and movie star Bing Horber will partner with Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower... Other registrants include House Speaker Martin, Attorney General Clark, and Naval Commander Nimitz, etc. If the Chinese people do not feel ashamed to see such a talent-rich, all-star game, some people may suspect that Americans are going crazy for football. Although they are so enthusiastic about practicing football, the occupying forces still suffered setbacks in playing football in Japan. I believe that if the Japanese team comes to challenge us, even if we use the same methods as against Seoul to create a battle record, we should still keep in mind: the personality of the Japanese is not as good as that of the Koreans!</p>
<p>Taking the battle between Han and the railway as a warning, we have received the lesson that "there is no undefeated army in the world." The motto for success is unique: "Work hard"!</p>

<p>Editor:</p>
<p>In the "Free Talk" column on the 7th of this month, the author of the article "Imaginary Space Floating Machine" ignored that the earth has "revolution" in addition to "rotation". The earth's rotation is the rotation of the earth around the earth's axis, which takes about 24 hours for each rotation, while the revolution is the rotation of the earth around the sun, which takes about one year for each rotation. Because the earth has these two movements at the same time, even if a "fixed space floating machine" can be invented and stay in the original space, the earth's revolution will cause the earth to leave the original empty machine, but because of the earth's revolution, the earth will leave the original space, so if the machine descends, it will fall into the vast space!</p>
<p>According to the latest scientific progress, transportation tools have the potential for complete innovation. The use of atomic energy can greatly enhance the range of aircraft. The use of radar can ensure the safety of flight. The V2 rocket is being tested to be used as a means of transportation between the earth and the moon. These scientific crystals left by the God of War will soon be used for transportation and make people feel simple and comfortable.</p>
<p>The above description may be helpful to those who are interested in "fixed space floating machines". I hope you will publish it. Sincerely, Chen Shishi, April 8, late at night "</p>
<h3>A Tale of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Old Zhu was deep in thought. He understood the psychology of this extremely slick old bureaucrat, knowing that more words would be futile; but this matter was truly making things difficult for him! It was a rare opportunity that Old Zhu was willing to let someone ride in his small chartered car; but the Lan family had three people, and two of them were children, how could they be separated? But to refuse outright would be to miss the opportunity entirely. The situation at the front lines was deteriorating so rapidly, if Lan didn't leave with her two children soon, the future was truly unimaginable.</p>
<p>"Alright!" Finally, he made up his mind—it's better for one to leave than none at all. "Since you can't think of any other way, Commissioner Zhu, I won't press the issue, but I hope that what you just promised won't change!"</p>
<p>"That's for sure!" Jin Aili interjected eagerly. "If his word doesn't count, I'd rather not go! Mr. Zhu, rest assured!"</p>
<p>Old Zhu and Old Zhu both glanced at her.</p>
<p>"Aili, thank you!" Zhu Zhaonian was somewhat moved. "Mrs. Hu can't possibly come with you, so it will probably be Feifei or Xiao Rong, and I'll have to ask you to take special care of them along the way. Mr. and Mrs. Hu will surely be grateful!"</p>
<p>Jin Aili nodded happily. Old Zhu said nothing, even somewhat agreeing. Because he knew that on this journey to Chongqing, he would be very busy with negotiations, buying and selling, and arranging vehicles. Leaving a woman like Jin Aili alone in a hotel or at any friend's house would be worrying. Having a child accompany her was like having a representative of his own. Moreover, the child wouldn't take up much space in the car, and wouldn't affect his planned itinerary.</p>
<p>A waiter hurried in, calling out: "Assistant Zhu, there's a phone call!"</p>
<p>"Very good." Old Zhu quickly stood up and said, "I'll be going now! I'll go talk to Mrs. Hu, and whether it's Feifei or Xiao Rong, I'll definitely bring him here before dinner!" Finally, he added specifically to Old Zhu: "Perhaps there will be one or two pieces of luggage."</p>
<p>"Good! Good! Good!" Old Zhu was eager to send him away, and kept agreeing.</p>
<p>"Rest assured! Leave everything to me!" Jin Aili also stood up to see him off, showing a very responsible demeanor.</p>
<p>So Zhu Zhaonian hurried back to Dongjiang. Since failing to board the train in Ertang last night, Lan was reluctant to return to the Xu family, and Old Zhu didn't advocate for her going back either. Fortunately, everyone in the small school where he was staying had left, and there were many empty rooms, so temporarily staying for a few days was no problem. Thus, Lan and her children set up shop in a large classroom downstairs, using twenty or thirty desks to make a large bed. (42)</p>
