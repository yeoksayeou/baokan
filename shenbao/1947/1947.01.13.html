<h3>滬上洽商吿一段落　大局最近尚難開朗　孫科張羣雷震昨夜返京</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕中立方面表示，各方在滬折衝告一段落後，和談中心即將由滬移京。聞共產黨方面對政府具體方案極注意，亟盼能獲悉政府究將如何解決國共間軍事及政治兩問題，並認談判能否進行，全視政府對共黨所提兩點究取何種態度。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕孫科，張羣，雷震三氏，均於昨日搭夜車晋京覆命，吳鐵城氏仍留滬。雷氏於行色匆匆中告記者：昨日曾赴範圍探望張君勱氏目疾，並謂：張氏目疾愈後，即可晋京。政府目前尚無解決時局之具體方案，一切需俟晋京詳商後方能決定。雷氏認爲，和談重開時，如需調人努力，各黨派均願協助，惟截至此時爲止，直接談判及調人折衝兩種方式，尚在衡量之中。恢復和談之新基礎，目前尚無頭緒，惟政府有充分誠意，如中共態度轉變，則和談可迅速重開。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕雷震昨夜返京，行前語記者稱：和談如何恢復，有待於政府討論後決定。關於重開和談之步驟，政府自必先行提出方案，作爲與共黨商談之基礎。派員赴延，政府早有計細，但其人選尚未決定。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕政府代表張羣，雷震，青年黨代表李璜，左舜生，民社黨代表伍憲子，萬糿千等，昨在張羣私寓中，作政府代表晉京前之最後一次交換意見。談話時，青年，民社兩黨對孫院長召開黨派圓桌會議之建議，均表贊同。兩黨對解決時局困難均未提出方案。據參與談話之某氏告記者：政府目前亦無具體方案。至於軍開和談之方式，亦尚未決定，惟政府有派遣代表赴延安之準備，但和談之是否能早日實現，全視中共之態度而定。以目前之情况而言，大局難望於短期內開朗。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕民社黨蔣勻田，十二日晚六時曾訪張治中交換意見，據蔣氏語記者，該黨對孫科召開圓桌會議之建議，甚表滿意。相信共方在口頭上不致反對，惟盼勿提具體條件，蓋如是適足以使雙方陷於僵持態度也。蔣氏說明該黨最近所作種種努力，其目的皆在促使和談早日重開，並信雙方若能互讓互信，一切皆不難解決。對圓桌會議討論重心，蔣拒加猜測。記者詢以該黨對馬帥聲明看法，蔣謂：一馬帥聲明旣公正，又公平，可見其在來華時期中，已把握着問題核心」。蔣表示不短期內不致赴滬，張君勱患重傷風，是否來京未定。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕靑年黨中常委周謙冲，十一日來京，與司徒大使，邵力子奪怱怱一晤後，當晚又赴滬。</p>

<h3>一年來之調處工作</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平十二日電〕十二日爲軍調處執行部在平成立一週年紀念日，迄至十二日晚尚未聞任何一方舉行紀念儀式。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十二日電〕烽烟遍地，和談黯淡，馬歇爾特使之返國，更增國人對軍事調處執行部今後存廢之關注，軍調部卅五年一月十三日成立於北平，已屆週年，追憶年來調處工作之得失，茲特綜合分折報道如次：</p>
<p>（一）一年來調處工作之努力及其失敗之經過：</p>
<p>一月　十日政府頒發停戰命令，限令十三日午夜起生效，同日中共毛澤東下停戰令，十三日在平成立軍調部，三方委員美大使館代辦饒伯遜，軍令部第二應廳長鄭介民，十八集團軍參謀長葉劍英聯袂飛平。軍調部成立伊始，即積極展開工作，向各衝突地區派遣停戰執行小組，並發布和字第一號命令，令永年附近國軍及共軍停止衝突，第二號命令，轉達實施停戰之原則及辦法，各地國軍將領接獲停戰命令，均予恪遵，歡迎谷小組前往執行任務，幷予以便利。廿三日成立羅山協定，停止衝突，共軍方面自十三日午夜起，華北各地共軍，續向國軍攻擊，先後攻佔東北之營口，山東之淄川·博山·河北之玉田·豐潤，河南之孟縣·考城，山西之侯馬，浮山·渾源，綏遠之集寗等縣。十四日起，蘇北共軍破壞隴海路東段，並攻佔膠濟路，津浦路原由國軍駐守之淄河店及界首等車站。山東之聯城·德州·長淸·泰安·兗州，山西之沁縣·聞喜，河北之泊頭·永年等城鎭，仍遭共軍圍攻，又山西境內共軍抽調的四萬人，經熱河之平泉·建昌·進入東北。</p>

<h3>一年來之調處工作</h3>
<p>上文接第一版</p>
<p>九月　山西共軍圍攻大同益急，國軍為解大同圍，十一戰區及十二戰區部隊，向張家口戒備，傅作養部進駐長寗，豐鎭，蘇北國軍進駐淮陰，淮安，平漢北段共軍發動攻勢，逼圍河北省政府所在地保定。</p>
<p>十月　全國各地術突愈益嚴重，平漢北段共軍，攻勢達最高點，徐水，望都，容城，新城，定縣等地國軍，均遭襲擊，保定四面被圍，平保保石間交通斷絕，鐵路被毀的二百公里，平津遭受空前威脅。陜北共軍北攻楡林。馬歇爾特使爲挽救和平，作休戰十日之建議，政府接受，但遭中共拒絕，十二戰區所部，及於十一日進駐張家口，十月初以來，共軍復於東北進攻，同月內關內調處執行小組及交通小組，共方代表均要求撤退，紛紛撤回北平。</p>
<p>十一月　政府發佈全面停戰令，自十一正午起生效，各地共軍復發動攻勢，山東方面攻陷平度，昌邑，包圍膠縣，進攻濟南；蘇北方面，進攻兩淮；山西方面，續窺大同，一部西波汾河，包圍楡林；東北境內小組共方代表，全部撤回長春，對共軍駐區小組政府及美方代表宣稱，不負安全責任。兩方代表逼於情勢，撤回長春。</p>
<p>十二月　調處工作全然陷於停頓，惟各執行小組政府及美方代表，仍留駐關內外各國軍駐區內，各地共軍謬續竄擾，冀省境內，續圍保定，並威脅北寗沿綫及平津保交通綫；晋省境內，進襲中陽；魯省境內，猛攻聯城，察省境內，屠殺崇禮人民；另部並繼續破壞膠濟路，阻撓黃河堵口復　工程。</p>
<p>（二）調處工作未能順利完成原因之分析：</p>
<p>調處工作進行一年，除將國內遣送日僑俘工作完成外，卒未能達到預期全面停止衝突恢復交通及整編軍隊之目標，至足惋惜，分析其主要原因有二：一即因共軍之不斷遠令進攻，破壞交通，及擴充軍備，使調處工作遭受直接之打擊；一即因共軍於各地阻撓各小組執行任務，間接妨碍調處工作之進展。</p>
<p>共軍違令進攻及破壞交通詳况，已槪見於前述一年來之調處經過中，自元月十三日停戰令下，共軍即利用國軍遵令停戰之機會，自偏僻之山地，進抵各鐵路綫，破壞路茲路軌，圍攻城鎭，以控制各交通據點，爭取有利地位，旋爲策應東北作戰，　動五月攻勢，於熱遠魯豫冀等地大規模進攻，使執行小組數月努力獲致之和平希望，粉碎無遺。自六月底起，共軍金圖完全控制魯晋，於華北完成其包圍之戰略形勢，一面威脅政府，俾於談判中居於有利地位，一面於魯豫晋各地，同時開始襲學國軍，以爲談判失敗發動全面內亂之凖備，七月起始共軍於華北及蘇北大舉攻城略地，藉思完成華北之割據，一面威脅首都，使政府於和會中喪失地位及信譽，以遂中共分裂割據之陰謀，同時以共軍各地攻勢遭受打擊，乃發動反美運動，中傷美國政府及其政策，對美方居問斡旋人士肆意詆蔑，並採取行動，威脅調處美方人員之安全，自元月十三日停戰令生效起，即不斷破壞交通，阻止搶修，使調處工作不能進展，此外復於關內及東北各地大事擴軍，使戰塲愈益遼闊，戰爭未嘗一日間歇，致令調處工作完全停頓。</p>
<p>過去一年間，共軍間接進展，即在對派赴各地之小組人員於執行任務時，加以阻延或限制，而其妨害小組行動極度表現，則對小組人員擅加扣留，或竟予殺害。是項事實，年來層出不窮，其最顯著者，爲六月十日共軍擊斃晏城第二十三小組雷奮强少校，六月十九日於孫莊擊斃新　第十小組譯員郭子祺少校，閔慶樞少校亦遭槍擊負傷，及後七月杪共軍復先後於北戴河據去美陸戰隊七名，並製造香河事件，擊斃美軍三人傷十一人，其動機亦均在威脅美方調處工作人員之安全，凡此均足以迫令調處工作遭受意外之困難。</p>
<p>綜觀一年來之調處，雖未能達到全面和平之目的，然已令吾人獲一顯明之認議，因其本身得失，即爲一明確一考騐，中共仍迷信武力，而捨和平之途不由。今日世界及中國均亟需和平，我國團結及興盛更有賴於和平之早日實現，調處工作爲獲致和平之唯一捷徑，亦屬人類最高智慧之表現，過去一年來之努力，雖未竟全功，中外愛好和平人士，對此調處機樞固仍寄以殷切希望也。（完）</p>

<h3>恢復和談應以誠意為先！</h3>
<p>這幾天來，南京上海兩地，充滿了恢復和談的空氣；彭學沛氏於九日在京發表談話，表示政府對於停止衝突及改組政府等問題之具體辦法，甚願與中共竭誠商談；孫科氏又於十日在滬發表對時局問題的一個建議，主張各黨派應即舉行圓桌會議。各方面對於彭孫二氏的談話，均非常重視，因此日來恢復和談的空氣更加濃厚了。在時局苦悶到極度的今天，能呼吸一些和談空氣，終覺得是一種可喜的現象，不能不認爲中國時局前途的一綫曙光；同時使我們也不能不指出，國共問題的和平解決，今天是最好的時機。政府，黨派，以及全國人民，必須及時把握，設法打開目下政治的僵局，達成和平統一民主建國的共同願望。</p>
<p>我們老百姓自國民大會完成制憲工作圓滿開幕之後，就一直把視議集中在恢復和談與改組政府的兩件事上，引領期待着好消息的傳播；但是十五天以來，人民的視綫，隨着政府要人的行蹤而移動，一忽兒在南京，一忽兒又在上海；幾乎望眼欲穿，同時並無時無刻不在提心吊胆的緊張情緒之下，而替這一綫的希望担心和焦慮，深恐和談的空氣又被吹散。試問人民爲什麽要如此關心國事？簡單的回答，因爲在我們四萬五千萬個的人心裹，都存着一個「和平統一民主建國」的願望。</p>
<p>記得在艱苦抗戰的時期內，全國的人民含辛茹苦，不願自己的生命財產，勇往直前，前仆後繼，與敵人作殊死戰，最後終算爭得了勝利的光榮；可是正待享受和平統一民主建國之際，戰勝國人民所應享受的幸福，却被戰亂的烽火呑沒了。今日在銜突區的人民，固然在水深火熱之中，就是在收復區的人民，也受到戰亂最殘酷的影響，因此還有誰不渴望和平的實現！</p>
<p>大戰結束後的世界，有如大病之初愈，不能立即恢復康健，固爲理之當然，例如伊朋希臘等國，在戰後都曾發生內戰，但是均已圓滿解決了。現在祇有我國的國共衝突，打打談談，談談打打，鬧了一年有半，還沒有和平解決，怎敎我們善良的人民不痛心疾首呢？怎敎我們善良的人民不希望和平有如大旱之望雲霓呢？再具體地說，今日之中國，險象環生，危機四伏，實在太凶險太嚴重了，比較抗戰期間軍事失和最黑暗的時候，更要可怕，更要危險。即使有良醫能對症發藥，亦不外乎開出下列四項藥方，（一）恢復交通；（二）發展工商業；（三）整軍統編；（四）改革政治。但是國內和平統一如不能實現，則一切都無從談起。所以和平是救中國唯一的康莊大這。</p>
<p>但是和平爲什麽像春夢一般的不可捉摸呢？我們的調人馬帥，憑其超人的智慧，罕有的韜略，以及不可動搖的信心，在中國奔走和平，歷十一個月之久，結果仍未能替中國人民　致和平；惟在臨行時發表了一個聲明，說明中國時局演變而成今日狀態之癥結所在，厥爲國共雙方的互相狤疑，同時並率直指出共產黨「究全不信任國民黨之領袖，彼等似乎相信：凡屬政府所提出之建議，無一非用以打倒共產黨者。」馬帥所稱各節，均極中肯，可謂一針見血，我們完全同意。而且認爲恢復和談若欲其成功；則應以消除猜疑爲先。應以推誠相見爲重。</p>
<p>政府渴望和平的迫切，甚至在人民之上；回顧一年以來的和談，不難證明政府在過去對於和談確有誠意，就是到今天，政府願與中共恢復和談，不僅有眞正的誠意，而且有極大的決心。在京滬兩地的嘗試如若不能成功，則政府將派大員前往延安，這更足以說明政府期望和談恢復的迫切了。所以現在恢復和談所成問題的，還在中共方面，因爲和戰的關鍵至今仍握在中共的手裏；而中共不僅對於恢復和談表示冷淡，而且仍堅持它對於恢復和談的先決條件：（一）恢復去年一月十日以前的軍事位置；（二）廢除憲法以及解散國民大會。姑不論其所提先決條件是否合理，中共對於恢復和談一定要提出先決條件，就是沒有誠意的表示。「不誠無物」，即使勉强恢復和談，恐怕也談不出和平來？又何必多此一舉呢？</p>
<p>我們始終認爲，國共問題的和平解決，今天是最好的時機，爲國家民族着想，同時也爲共產黨本身打算，中共必須及時把握，萬萬不可再錯過了這可貴的時機。中共近年來固執的作風，實有重行考慮的必要，如果再執迷不悟，則不僅要遭受全國人民的指摘與　棄，而且也要失去各民主國家的同情。美國參議院外交委員會主席范登堡前天十一日在克里夫蘭城發表的演說，是値得中共注意的。所謂「得道者多助，失道者寡助」，中共尤其應該提高警覺。　如中共矢口否認國民大會所通暹的憲法，實在沒有理由可言。無論站在那一個角度去觀察：這一部新憲法不能不說是以政協原則爲基礎的一部民主憲法，中共旣擁護政協決議，爲什麽要反對以政協原則爲基礎的憲法呢？再如中共堅持恢復去年一月十日軍事位置，更足使人懷疑中共的眞正意向，中共爲什麼不多提出些對於時局的意見，而偏偏只替自己的地盤打算呢？我們願坦白告訴中共，這兩個先決條件，不僅爲政府所不能接受，就是在我們老百姓，也不會答應中共的要求的。</p>
<p>不過我們認爲中國今日的問題，不是任何一黨一派的問題，而是整個國家整個民族的問題，所以我們要求各黨派，應提高對於民族國家的向心力，而减低因黨派成見所造成的離心力。現在旣是解決國共問題的最好時機，則政府，黨派以及全國人民，就應該及時把握，採納孫科氏所提出的圓桌會議的方式，無條件的立即恢復和談，大家平心靜氣，摒除一切黨派的利害及成見，檢討過去，磋商將來，在互信互讓的精神之下，替目前困難的局勢覓出一條新的途徑來，俾使中國早日走上和平統一民主建國的坦途。</p>
<p>要之，恢復和談，應以消除猜疑爲先，應以推誠相見爲重，我們主張立即無條件的恢復和談，但對於和談的方式，不論是圓桌會議，抑或是黨派會議，均可不問，祗要大家均能有互信互讓的精神，任何困難的問題均不難謀得解決。中華民族憑其良智，和平解決國內的爭　，不信其束手無策的。更下信其從此亡國滅種；因爲在抗戰期間，我們深信，抗戰必勝，奮鬥了八年，終於獲得了最後勝利，現在我們相信建國必成，只要大家能以國家爲重，和平爲先，相見以誠，遍早必能贏得和平的！</p>

<h3>錦城歲寒圖</h3>
<p>— 成都訊　本報特約記者周學端</p>
<p>暗流罩成都</p>
<p>成都—錦城—是中國西南歷史名都，到過成都的人，一定會寄與深切而美麗的留念。一般人認爲現代中國都市能代表典型中國末位文化的，祗有北平，成都與蘇州。北平代表蒼凉悲壯，雄偉恢廊的河北文化，蘇州代表秀　機巧，嬌媚婀娜的江南之美，而成都兼斯二者，於蒼凉中不失秀麗，於嬌媚中深着雄偉，這是從來曾經流連成都的人所一致公認的。</p>
<p>成都平原是天府之國的最富庶之區，成都人久習於逸樂繁華平靜的環境。養成享受達觀間散的習性。抗戰八年，砲火洗禮洗不掉成都人恬靜作風，但是勝利一年，復員帶來的「倒風」，「漲風」種種不景氣的暴雨疾風，掃蕩了成都人一切平靜安逸的現實生活。臘盡冬殘，年頭歲尾，天寒地凍，北風更捲來了物便激漲，工商崩潰，文化破產，社會墮落種種暗雲寒風。錦城歲寒，已經不是「錦城絲管日紛紛，半入江風半入雲」的「錦城絲竹」時代，冬來的成都，已被籠罩在混亂與不景氣的暗流寒霧中了。</p>
<p>冬來有三風</p>
<p>冬來，隨着西伯利亞寒流，同時侵襲全國的「漲風」與「倒風」，吹到成都市上。月來物價如不雄之馬，飛躍疾漲，領袖物價的黃金由廿萬突破卅五萬大關，白米由五萬漲達八萬。一時百物市塲陷入混亂狀態，物價作直綫上昇，政府束手無策，小民心驚胆戰，據說這次漲風是人爲作祟，言者　　指出，蓉市各大銀行倉庫中金條出積，米　陳倉？但是道者自道，漲者自漲，眼看投機者笑逐顏開，窮苦人啼飢號寒，好在處灶時勢，窮人餓死凍餒，無哈希奇！</p>
<p>緊接着漲風之後，發生了一通串的社會問題，這是成都新興與特出的三風－「自殺風」，「吃風」，「盜風」。高物價壓迫下的低薪給公務員，失業者衆、窮苦民衆，逼於生活，善良者走上第一條路，强梁者被迫挺而走險，踏上後兩條路。第一的「自殺風」，自殺而成風，這是最悲慘的社會現象，也是最嚴重的社會問題。入冬以來成都社會的自殺案層出不窮，幾乎日必數起，自殺者都是小公務員失業青年與貧病小民。自殺原因都是生計困難家庭糾紛婚姻問題等，也有好幾件爲房東加租壓迫而自殺的，這種「自殺風」引起社會注意與重視，據社會學家前齊魯大學校長劉世傳分析，這是抗戰八年社會長期混亂，人心極度失望產生的另一種變態精神病，非從社會經濟根本改善，是無法遏止的。「吃風」是近日成都社會特產，一名「吃大戶」，即是集體白吃之意，數日來，此風爲失業軍人表現淋漓盡致，元旦前後曾有數百名失業軍人，一呼百從，集團赴各大餐廳「白吃」，彼光顧者有勝利，榮盛等餐廳，此風現爲川康綏署制止，或可稍戢。「盜風」是各都市普遍現象，成都入冬防以後，治安愈加强，盜風亦愈熾，統計上月份盜案已在六百件以上，以人口不滿百萬的四川省會，這不能不算是一個怵目驚心的數字罷</p>
<p>工商瀕崩潰</p>
<p>急景殘年，百業凋敝，隨着「漲風」到成都的是「倒風」。今年成都工商業，因爲八年來四川農村負荷過重，民力已歇。加以去年川省有一一四縣普遍水旱災荒，此外尚需負擔本年九百萬石田糧徵借，農村經濟，己瀕總崩潰邊緣，影響到四川整個工商業的生存問題。同時外貨傾銷，土貨無法生存，正在萌芽萬壯的成都工商業，遂如風前燭，瓦上霜，人　岌岌可危的狀態。</p>
<p>首先是成都工業，成都以手工業馳名全國，例如馳譽遐邇與湘繡齊名的「蜀錦」，戰前北銷平津，南運印緬，尤爲英美人士所實愛稱道，目前已呈衰落現象。入冬以後的調查，全市織戶由戰時三千餘戶减至二千餘戶，織工由十餘萬人减至六萬餘人，銷路尤爲遲滯。又如成都新式工廠，戰時有六十八家，今冬祗存四十四家，規模宏大的申新紗廠，裕華紗廠，福華絲廠，福昌豬鬃廠，四川機械公司等營業已成　勢，整個工業，均不景氣。</p>
<p>成都商業，本來是川西北運銷總棧，爲陜甘康藏的輸紐，戰後因為滬港貨物通暢，貿易亦曾發　一時。入冬以後，由於貨價波動，人民購買力枯歇，交易等於停滯，同時滬地子金甚高，遊資集中上海，成都遂發生十年未有的銀根空前奇緊現象。於是「倒風」掃襲，一連串的銀號錢莊大商店關門倒閉，擾動了整個金融市塲，掀起金融大波，到今天餘波仍在邊　。</p>
<p>在省市當局協助下，　市工商界勉强渡過國曆年關，然而接踵而來的舊曆年關　息即至，這是工商各業生存的試金石，工商界人士說：「過了舊年，才算遇了鬼門關哩」！</p>
<p>文化的悲哀</p>
<p>這幾天正是四川敎育界一年兩度「六臘戰爭」行將展</p>
<p>開的時候，環顧當前的成都敎育文化，實在令人心　感歎！成都本是中國西南文化中心地，戰時一度擁有十個著名大學，號稱全國文化城，報紙與書店，亦蓬勃發達，欣欣向榮。可是在今天，無論敎育文化，學校，報業，書店，一致在悲哀中茍延發喘，成都文化，已是在日趨下落中了！</p>
<p>成都敎育，去年大學由十所復員六所，現存四所中每期不過容納二千餘人，大學失學的人數統計在二萬人以上，這是敎育一嚴重問題。而全川整個敎育經費，尤支絀萬分，去年敎育復員經費八億元，中央僅撥下四億五千萬，財廳則又僅撥二億五千萬，餘數槪行尅扣。敎廳長劉明揚爲此已拂袖辭職，目前正在醞釀全川省縣立中學校長的總辭職，成都各中學生亦將大遊行，請求增加敎育經費與敎經獨立，爲了靑年學子莘莘向學之心，爲了救濟失學靑年，敎育現况，令人一痛。</p>
<p>蓉市報業在高物價之下，已感不能支持，上月爲了工友增薪，全市十九家報紙聯合發出痛苦呼籲，道出心底哀痛，要求政府貸款，否則一致休刋，然而縱貸得戔戔之數，又何濟今後緩急？報界同業說，舊年不特工商業過關，新聞業也要過關，領導社會的新聞業情况如此，能不爲成都文化前途悲！</p>
<p>成都書店戰時原有于新舊書業二百六十餘家，入冬以後僅存一百四十餘家，大部純靠低級的色情小說維持營業，然亦不免搖搖欲墮。</p>
<p>這是成都文化界的整個輪廟，歲寒風凍，在成都文化園地作一巡　，這裏充滿的是失望悲哀與痛苦，趨勢是退化與下落，光明遠景，在暗流寒霧中被遮沒。難道曾經燦爛一時的成都文化，就這樣消沉下去嗎？成都文化界朋友心是不甘的，他們要在艱難環境中奮鬥，人力勝天，這是成都文化界前途的一綫希望。</p>
<p>漫漫長冬，春天何時到來？這幾天正是元旦佳節，成都氣候，明暖和麗，人們瞻望着高巍的紀念碑，雄偉的無名英雄像，流通在幽靜的望江裡，秀美的華西壩，地靈人傑的古城，終會從歲寒中轉到春天的。</p>

<h3>美須保持必要軍備協力維護合法和平　貝爾納斯退職前末次公開演說強調此點　美管制原子政策不致變更</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十二日廣播：貝爾納斯在克里夫蘭發表臨別演說稱：渠相信世界各國可由努力合作　致正義的和平。渠促請美政府繼續貫澈其堅强之對蘇政策。貝氏稱：吾人切不可因調和意見之方法不能立刻調得，而即認爲和平之努力已屬無望。</p>
<p>〔路透社克里夫蘭十一日電〕美國務卿貝爾納斯今日在此間「時代雜誌」與克里夫蘭世界問題硏究會共同主辦之國際政治座談會中發表退職前之末次公開演說。渠對完成建立公正和平一點表示極大信心，但又主張美國必須維持必要之軍事力量，俾在協力維持合法和平之任務中，担任其應盡之責任。渠指出武力雖不能製造公理，但在目前尚未臻於完善之世界中，武力以及理智均足以影響國際決議。貝爾納斯復强調主張建立法律在國際間應右之地位，使任何一國不得强迫他國接受其意見，並日美國或其他任何國均不應有統治世界之權，目前各强國間之權力關係使任何一國不能以片面行動統治世界，茍有此項企圖，則整個聯合國之機構均將受其嚴重擾亂。貝爾納斯並未述及渠之辭職及爲歇爾將軍之新職，而對於蘇聯亦僅對該國在聯合國原子能辯論中之態度，作一隱約之批評。</p>
<p>貝氏論及蘇聯之堅決主張立即討論整個裁軍問題一點時，謂美國主張先討論原子武器之管制，因該項武器乃破壞力量最大之武器，深信如能就該事成立協定，則關於管制其他武器及裁减軍備等均不難成立協定。貝氏對於前德國附庸國和約之完成表未滿意，認爲討論德奧和的時將因此便利不少。渠認過去一年中美國在外交上之進步，皆因全國有一致之外交政策之故。　貝氏復謂經濟困難，飢饉及疾病均爲政治不安定之主要原因，故爲維持和平起見，應消滅誘起侵略戰之經濟與社會因素。美國對於某種國家必須繼續予以救助，而對於國際銀行，國際貨幣基金會及專事對外貸款之美國進出口銀行，必須盡力予以支持。美國更應堅決執行其相互貿易原則之政策及其所提之國際貿易機構章程，以擴大美國及世界之貿易，防止經濟集團之產生，促成世界之繁榮，澈底消滅政治不安定之因素。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十一日電〕此間右資格觀察家頃談稱：自美國出席聯合國原子能委員會代表巴魯克辭職後，美國之原子政策雖可能更具「伸縮性」，但亦不致有大規模之變更。白魯克之成就及其所提出之建議，曾備受稱道。許多人士均認爲奧斯丁參議員繼任巴魯克之遺缺實屬當之無愧。評論家對於巴魯克辭職理由，雖所見不同，但多數均謂巴魯克此舉乃爲合理之步驟。蓋以其本人任務旣已定成，談判之責自應由美國出席安全理事會代表祖任也。</p>
<h3>關於柯孚海峽事件　阿對英覆文公佈　駁斥英指控各戰拒絕賠償道歉</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約十一日電〕英駐聯合國安理會代表賈德幹，昨致函聯合國秘書處，提出英國控訴阿爾巴尼亞案，前此阿爾已尼亞答覆英國抗議之覆文，亦載於函中，該覆文之內容，尚係第一次發表。賈德幹之函謂，英政府認爲阿爾巴尼亞之答覆，完全不能滿意，故英政府令其根據聯合國憲草第卅五條，早日將該項爭端向安理會提出。阿國覆文係於十二月廿一日送達英駐南斯拉夫大使皮爾斯，其中對英驅逐艦兩艘於十月間在柯孚海峽觸及水雷因而有水手四十四名殞命一節，表示深切遺憾。但同時則鄭重駁斥英國抗議書中指控阿國之各點，指出該項指責，與阿國人民一再表示之和平志願，及阿政府對英國或其他民族之友好政策均不相符。並日，英政府對阿國之政策，未能常以和平目的爲光導，實屬遺憾，如英政府之支持希臘帝國主義份子無理要求阿國之一部份土地，英國堅決反對亦爲盟國之一，阿爾巴尼亞加入聯合國機構，在討論和的時英政府對阿爾巴尼亞表現之不友善態度，及英政府之拒絕與阿政府樹立正常外交關係等行爲，均足表示英國對阿之不友好。更甚者英國並有直接侵犯阿國主權之行爲，例如英軍艦兩艘曾於一九四六年五月，未獲准許侵入阿國領海，十二月廿二日又有同樣事件發生，至十月廿三日英飛機復侵入阿爾巴尼亞，十一月十二日有以作戰隊形編隊之英艦經過阿國南岸，翌日英艦復在薩朋達外向空開射機關槍。阿國政府對此等「非法行爲」，前已籲請聯合國機構注意，而在十月廿二日英艦兩艘受傷之事件中，英艦之通過柯孚海峽北部，實已嚴重破壞善意通行權之原則。關於英方指責阿國在柯孚海峽敷雷·或知悉他國在該處敷雷。或知悉該處有水雷等節，完全缺乏根據，實屬中傷阿政府及人民之和平意志。阿政府認爲如果此事確有惡意，則必係意欲破壞英阿友好關係之人所爲。阿國政府於此點，可以提出下列事實以支持之，即希臘及他國船舶，固常未得准許侵入阿國南部領海。阿政府之覆文繼謂，阿政府建議派混合委員團調查此事，完全出諸誠意，目的在以友好合作之精神解決此事。最後阿國覆文聲明，英政府所指各節旣均缺乏根據，故對要求償付罹難英艦員家屬卹金向英方道歉各節，均不能加以接受。</p>
<h3>美將在遠東採取新政策　阻止共產主義繼續蔓延　每年將以廿億美元從事救濟</h3>
<p>〔本報特派員華盛頓十二日電〕美國著名新聞雜誌「世界報吿」稱：美國將採取實際步驟，阻止美國以外各國共產主義之蔓延，據謂東方共產主義之猖獗，已引起美當局之極大注意。新國會將予縝密之考慮。在中國，朝鮮與日本，經濟情形之惡化，已更利於共產主義之發展，威脅眞正之民主。目前美國有三種途徑可走：（一）美國退出歐亞洲；（二）繼續現行政策；（三）採取新政策。消息靈通方面稱美方將採取第三種新政策，以大批物資與食糧接濟各需要救濟國家，在此方面，美國每年將用去二十億美元。</p>
<h3>勞合喬治先見之明　美發表秘密檔案</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十一日合衆電〕美國務院今發表關於一九一九年巴黎和會之秘密檔案，內示當時英首相勞合喬治曾向美總統威爾遜及法總理克里孟梭提出警告謂，蘇聯在大戰後，將起爲一强大及富於野心之國家，蘇聯將造成斯拉夫民族國家，最後可能控制世界上一億六千萬人民。按一部份文件所示，第一次世界大戰後，英美兩國政治家亦似此次之關切共產主義之迅速成長，惟對布爾雪維克之蘇聯，將爲何威脅世界之意見，則不一致。威爾遜認爲勞合喬治對蘇聯之威脅，過份悲觀，而對蘇聯之社曾經濟發展能力，過份樂觀。</p>
<h3>威爾斯分析　遠東局勢</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十二日合衆電〕美前副國務卿威爾斯廣播稱：英荷諸國政府決定予印緬以獨立，予印尼以自治，展望大局，極爲光明。過去數月中，中國長期艱苦之內戰，其增長之可能性，甚於其消弭之可能性，東亞和平之關鍵，在於華盛頓與莫斯科間之最後全盤諒解，在此項諒解未獲致前，實無理由期望改善。</p>

<h3>日本賠償問題（下）</h3>
<p>— 本報東京特派員　傳俊儀</p>
<p>自鮑萊最後報告發表後，日政府即連日舉行閣議，討論對策。據稱：日政府之對策，希能將工業生產力之限制，予以緩和，提高至昭和十二年（一九三七年）之水準，即中日戰爭勃發之時。據稱該項對策希能將日本國民生活水準維持在昭和五年（一九三〇年）的程度，如能維持該項水準，每年尚須輸入糧食，衣料原料，石油橡皮等必需品三十億日圓，而輸出能力如生絲及其他物品僅十一億日圓。其差額尚不足二十億，須自國外轍入原料及半製品加工再將之輸出以資彌補，故工業生產能力須維持在昭和十二年（一九三七年）的水準。</p>
<p>實施賠償對日影響</p>
<p>如根據鮑萊案，各項賠償物十萬撤去後，以人口八千萬加以計算時，數年後日本之經濟規模如何？關於此種問題，此間有力人士之見解如下：</p>
<p>（一）如須維持昭和五年之生活水準，以昭和十一年之價格水準加以計算，則須輸入糧食八三千萬圓，衣料十億五千萬圓，工業原料及其他物品十五億二千萬圓，約計三十四億日圓。但日本輸入該種物品須依靠外國商船，運費約二億日圓，故輸入金額將達三十五億日圓。</p>
<p>（二）與此三十五億日圓交換之商品為鐵維製品十一億日圓，機械金屬製品四億五千萬圓，化學製品及藥品三億圓，生絲，水產物，陶磁器，玻璃器具及其他物品爲八億五千萬圓，其中能以國內原料生產者，僅有生絲玻璃器具的八億日圓，其他各項原料均須仰給於國外的輸入。</p>
<p>（三）除紡織機應有九百萬錠外，（內包括國內消費）其他如製鐵，機械化學工業等部門最小限度之加工設備，亦屬必要，但因鐵非鐵金屬，奇性碱等基礎產業已受限制，該項製品必須大量輸入。人造象牙及焦油製品，酒精及藥品消費之一部亦須仰給於國外的輸入。</p>
<p>紡織機限完爲需要量之二分之三，化學製品機械金屬製品亦將受限制。在鋼珠工業，焦油工業，酒精工業，人造象牙工業完全撤走後，機械工業及化學必感相當困難。</p>
<p>賠償案實行後，工業規模必受限制，輸出部門亦有限度，故工業部門所能給養人口必將縮小，而將有相當失業人數發生。人口如以八千萬計算時，將來農業所得吸收的人口最多不過爲一千五百萬人。八千萬人口中有業人口數如以三千六百八十萬人計算，五百萬人爲商業所吸收，五百八十萬人就業於其他各部門，尚餘一千萬人，應由工業部門所吸收。</p>
<p>華府將作最後決定</p>
<p>關於鮑萊對日賠償最後報告，華府方面尚未作具體決定。現由各專家改訂中。鮑萊曾將日本產業水準限定在一九二六年至一九三〇年間的水準，似有改訂爲一九二八年至一九三四年間水準之可能。此間盟國最高統帥部前曾數次由請華府方面關於對日賠償政策，應採寬大政策。日政府案主張維持在一九三〇年經濟水準，該案已遞呈總部轉交華府。總部關於對日賠償問題之態度，據該方面官員稱：（一）曾竭力主張應確立一足以令日本工業繼續存立之政策。（二）總部對於一切問題以及日本對經濟復興之努力，甚爲熱悉。（三）對日賠償方針係以前所定，惟其後情勢發生變化，故應有所修正。目下已有不少此種變化發生，尤其在日本產業方面所起之變化。</p>
<p>中國部份如何處置</p>
<p>最後就對日賠償案中中國應得部份處置問題置一言。據稱：一千二百萬噸賠償物資中，中國可分得三百六十萬噸，將來撤却，運輸以及撤回後的復工技術問題都値得研究。有若干化學工業如苛性碱工業，撤却後即無法再行建立。在日本本身已有若千成例在先，戰時有若干工廠爲避免空襲，自名古屋疏散至長野，設備之損失幾達半數。即使一切技術及運輸問題均告解決，搬回後並可即立裝置復工，但在目前如此高價生產成本情形之下，出品能否與其他價廉物美的先進國生產品競爭，亦成問題。除若干重要工業，技術運輸裝置復元等問題自身能解決者，將若干工業暫行留置日本利用日人技術及低廉勞働力再加以嚴格的監督，繼續開工，亦並非不是値得愼重檢討的問題。否則仍舊演成接收即停工的現象，不僅是中國自身的損失，也就是東亞益體生產力的浪費。</p>
<p>盟國管制日本委員會之中，蘇，英，美國代表。</p>

<h3>吃飯問題熱烈討論　筵席捐起徵點決改為五千元　分等問題意見紛歧未獲結果　今晨大會繼續討論</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會昨日下午舉行第六次會議，討論財政提案五項，其中關於筵席稅起征點及菜館分甲乙兩等征收二問題引起激烈辯論，討論達二小時之久。結果筵席起稅點雖經表決仍按五千元通過，惟關於分等問題，仍未獲解決。後經提出意見四點，經表決均不過半數，將於今日上午大會繼續討論。關於四點之意見如下：</p>
<p>（一）起稅點問題：原定爲三千元，經財政委員會決議改至五千元。周濂澤提議由五千元提高至一萬元爲起稅點，當有若干參議員附議，但另有數議員仍主張維持五千元，結果大多數通過。</p>
<p>（二）分等問題：財政局長谷春帆稱：按照中央規定每席有一定價格者爲筵席稅，如按菜館方面爭議，以爲西菜不稱每席，而稱每客，故不得征收，中菜滿十人，價在十萬元以上始可稱「席」，則市府所收稅捐將寥寥無幾，故不得不訂立一種辦法。而稅法若無準確規定，則無法防止走漏或中飽情事。目前市府所訂標準爲：凡一菜館普通營業大多數每次超過二萬五千元者，此館即列爲甲等，收筵席稅百分之二十；凡大多數營業每次在二萬五千元以下者列人乙等，征稅百分之十。但局方亦並不予以硬性規定，尚須視該館價格是否便宜而定。如乙等中有訂價標準與甲等相近者，則仍將其列入甲等，反之，甲等中訂價低廉者可列入乙等。此目的乃使市民受惠。</p>
<p>參議員對此案紛紛發表不同意見：朱文德，陸蔭初，費樹聲，路式導，吳正矱等均不贊成分等級，認爲不合理，不公平。吳正矱並謂中央並未規定分等，此案根本不應討論，討論即違法。經大會表決是否欲擱置，但大多數不贊成。路式導則謂此案與中央法令違背，現在不予分級，俟中央修正法令後再討論。</p>
<p>有人吃的是裝璜陶百川主張分等</p>
<p>然陶百川則主張分等，認爲世界上有許多人願意多用此錢，他們吃的是裝璜，或菜肴優越，或廚子名聲好，不在乎多付些稅，而事實上許許多多大飯館並不受捐稅高之影響，也照樣賺錢。瞿鋮亦贊成要分等級，認爲有許多闊人願意到甲等館子去多付，儘管讓他們去，否則他們請起客來，會覺得對不起客人！</p>
<p>徐副議長寄廎亦表示吃飯問題，大必須詳細討論，同意分等，因市民經濟力量不同。李文杰提出折衷辦法，喚起同人注意，主張分等，但有附帶條作，即甲等中如有不滿二萬五千元一次之營業者，應按乙等標準，即按百分之十征收。</p>
<p>結果提出四種意見付表決：（一）贊成分甲乙兩等，（二）不贊成分等，（三）按李參議員意見即甲等中不滿二萬五千元者按百分之十征收，（四）按路參議員提談，目前不分，俟中央法令修正後，再作決定。結果每種意見都不過半數，大會無法決定，尚待今日繼續討論</p>
<h3>俱樂部不納稅　局長稱係某種關係</h3>
<p>至吳正矱詢及新生活俱樂部爲何不征稅？茶點收稅情形如何？谷局長即答稱：本市不納稅之俱樂部尚不止新生活一家，因某種關係，財政局職權不能達到，但已屢次與俱樂部當局接洽繳稅。茶點一項照舊稅法認爲屬於奢侈項下者皆應納稅，但照中央新稅法則不必納稅，此點亦可請市參議會討論決定。徐副議長作補充稱：前租界時代一切外國俱樂部，都不納稅，因當時有許多俱樂部確係三數私人作爲休息之處，但現在俱樂部都變成公共塲所，故主張不論中外俱樂部，應一律按菜館征收。</p>
<h3>一夕數驚住旅館各色人等查房間　應請政府注意旅客安寗　討論徵收旅棧捐決議按照百分五</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會財政委員會審查之「現行旅棧捐加重旅客負担，阻碍旅社營業，且於法無據，擬函市府即日停止徵收，以蘇民困」一案，昨亦提出大會中討論甚久。潘議長特退議長席，首次正式發表意見稱：旅棧捐照百分之五徵收，雖為數很少，但旅棧業代表曾一再向市參議會請願，陳述困難，營業確實淸淡。蓋有一部分旅客，憑特殊勢力不肯納捐，致旅館當局不得不予代納，若干旅館甚至代納數百萬元之多。旅館在敵偽時期變成一種畸形營業，為烟賭不合法行為之大本營，故以特別課稅徵收，確屬應該。但現在旅棧業是否應以特別營業視之，値得大家注意。硏究旅館方面最感痛苦者有二：（一）一般旅館之帳房，不能管束茶房，得罪旅客後，館主無力管理，由茶房作主，此點政府有無方法幫助解決？（二）檢查方面，旅館內每日有穿制服者，便衣者，莫明其妙之人員，無定時，無定期，無定班，於深夜往客人房內檢查，例如有旅客在屋內酌酒自飲，檢查者即謂此係犯法之舉，並言「要吃酒可到王寳和去」！諸如此類情形，把老百姓不當人待，故除非萬不得已，無人敢來做旅客，這是表現了政治須要由下層來熬飭。其實旅客生活安定，多納些捐也願意，故特代爲呼籲，政府一方面收稅，一方面亦須顧到人民痛苦。</p>
<p>吳市長起立聲明二市府對旅客安寗，確已想到，並設法改善，但在（一）檢查方面，並無六種之多，已請警備司令部會同警察局共同檢查一次。前租界時，旅館完全成爲烟賭大本營，風氣敗壞，但現在仍須維持社會善良風氣，市府與各位均應負責。（二）業主與茶房亦係勞資糾紛，本人曾接見勞資雙方各一次，曾對勞方切實告誡，勞方此次要求年終獎金，依例無據，亦已告知勞方不得堅持。對於館方代客負担捐稅，其中情形，市府亦深切明瞭同情。但痛苦是一問題，稅捐又是一問題，痛苦方面，決盡力接受意見予以改善。至中央規定說法以，後本市如再更改，手續極爲麻煩，不如依照中央規定辦法徵收。　繼由議員發表意見，陶百川主張贊成中央法令，如中央修改百分之五爲百分之十，亦應贊同，因爲爲保障本市市民利益起見，對外來旅客應納之稅當可征收，否則將增加本市市民負祖。駱淸華則主張一定要有數字規定，以百分之五爲限，對保護本市市民利益而使外客負担加重一點，不能同意，欲繁榮上海市，必須歡迎外客，而况住在旅館中，本市亦有極多人。邵永生亦稱二有許多公務員住在旅館中，他們亦爲市民之一，爲何一定要使他們負担加重。結果此案經大會多數通過，照邵永生意見修正，決議爲「應照百分之五征收」。</p>
<h3>土地營業兩稅決請劃歸地方</h3>
<p>昨日大會中又通過其他三案：（一）電請中央撥補財產租賃所得稅及印花稅。（二）電請中央將土地及營業稅收全部劃歸地方。（三）爲奉令繼續籌募卅二年同盟勝利公債五億元，除增派補派外，其餘一億元擬由市府另行勸募，交區公所負責分担勸募，俾得速成任務。</p>
<h3>預算算不清休會無了期</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會第二屆第二次大會議程，原定今日上午舉行紀念週，討論市卅六年度預算後，即行休會。頃以尚待討論之案件太多，未克如期完成，故今日上午將繼續討論有關稅捐及財政等提案。同時對大會是否延期問題，亦將於今日大會中提出公決。</p>
<h3>錢劍秋招待婦女界　報吿出席國大經過　爭取權利獲得成功</h3>
<p>市婦女會理事長兼婦女運動委員會主委錢劍秋女士，昨午三時，假愛麥處限路警察俱樂部，舉行茶會，招待本市各婦女團體負責人，報告出席國大情形，及全體女代表力爭憲法條文經過。到有上海德育婦女勵進會，中華婦女同盟會婦女職業敎育，法學，醫藥，勞動，體育，中學生，大學生，家庭等機構，中華婦女社，中華婦女革新會，三民主義青年團女青年組等代表。此外如本市各婦女界，代表張湘汶，方英達，朱素蔓，吳若華，陳振權，沈慕貞，兪淑明，謝晉元夫人，王家珍，王佩珍，賈觀菁　嚴蔚如，邱希聖，蘇祖斐，凌其等均到會，濟濟一堂，共五十餘人。當即由錢氏致詞略稱：本屆國民大會，制定之憲法，關於保障婦女參政權一點，行將成為世界上最進步之憲法，英美及歐洲各國憲法，對於婦女政治權利，雖未作如此切實規定，但深信中國婦女於此次大會中所提出之要求，乃世界婦女所共同一致的希求，因世界各國，至目前為止，婦女在政治上尚無眞正平等，故中國婦女此次在憲法上獲得之成功，實足自　。婦女地位的提高，固不僅在爭取參政權，但參政權的不能展開，乃婦女增進權利的主要障碍。此次國民大會中，蔣夫人為婦女權利力爭，實足稱道，婦女提案獲大會通過，即將來各種選舉中規定婦女所佔名額為百分之廿，而國民大會代表產生之方式中，亦指定由婦女團體選出代表，此外立法委員中婦女名額，亦將有所規定。</p>
<h3>上午審查會議討論中心工作　各局計劃提要已審查修正</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會審查市政府三十六年度中心工作計劃及去年九月至十一月施政槪况報告之特別委員會，昨日上午假座福明邨市參議會址舉行，各局皆推派代表參加。席間陶百川稱：預算根據中心工作而來，中心工作不確定，預算亦不能確定。此次市府所擬工作計劃與所編預算，無密切配合，有脫節之嫌。而參議會事先不將此中心工作計劃分別交各小組審查，已屬遺憾。今各小組審查會已告一段落，再開不可能，乃指定十九人組織本會審查之，因其中多係專門學識，故恐力不勝任，但旣受命，當盡力爲之云。經一致同意對計劃之實施方法及完成期限，不予討論。計劃提要則予審查修正。</p>
<p>（一）民政：整頓保甲，戶口查記爲三十六年度中心工作，業奉行政院指定，而推行淸潔區亦爲重要業務。</p>
<p>（二）警政：一，提高警察棄質，加強警察訓練。二，强化消防設備。（關於增加警員六千名一節暫緩，如有必要時，再提請追加預算。）</p>
<p>（三）社會：一，抑平物價。二，推進合作事業。三，充實救濟機構。四，力謀勞資合作，增進生產。（其中第三項救濟機構因已由社會局第四處主管，故預算中之市救濟院，予以撤裁，以節省經費。）</p>
<p>（四）敎育：一，增設國民學校及國民敎育班。（預算中之國民敎育班酌量减少，以作多設國民學校之用）二，增設民衆學校補習學校及職業學校。原計劃中籌集敎育基金倡導私人興學一點，敎育局以在此百業不景氣情况之下，不易籌款，故昨已自動撤回緩辦）</p>
<p>（五）財政：本市三十六年度財政工作計劃，除繼續進行三十五年度各重要事務，如簡化稽征手續，及剔除中飽等外，應增加稅八，尤應開征全市房捐及節省不急要之開支為中心工作。</p>
<p>（六）工務：一，發展郊區交通，二，减除水患。三，恢復南市閘北·四，救濟房荒。五，都市計劃。（工務局本年度溝通蘇州河南北兩岸交通工程，防潦工程，浦東大道展築工程之（預算，原爲五百零三億，現因經費不够，减去二百十八億，故本年祗能做一部份，該案當另行討論）。</p>
<p>（七）公用：一，增加動力，充實公用事業。二，改善碼頭倉庫。三，添裝路燈。四，解決滬西水荒（因市府已有專案提出，故留待大會討論）。五，加强公共交通。</p>
<p>（八）地政：一，整理圖籍。二，地籍整理。三，規定地價。四，推行地價稅。</p>
<p>（九）衛生：一，推行保健工作。二，改善環境衛生。</p>
<p>因時間不及，故昨日對於施政槪况報告之審查，不及舉行。當商定由該小組召集人王劍鍔，陶百川，傅汝霖會同朱文德，童行白，吳正矱共同負責，以審查意見作就書面報告，於今日提交大會。</p>

<h3>寗為不孝子不作薄倖人？　滬江畢業生殉情服毒死</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕青年葛文駿，二十五歲，寗波人，住中正中路四明邨九號。民國卅三年畢業於滬江大學，嗣任職於敵偽產業處理局，至去夏六月問，改人外灘匯豐大樓二〇八號茂恒進出口行，任會計員。平日早出晚歸，閒來即以閱書報消遷，或以引逗弟妹爲樂。詎前日（十日）忽一夜未歸，至翌晨，其父葛洪忠（在九九油豆號供職）得訊，致電話該行詢問，知當時文駿尚未到行辦公。再電家中詢問，據家人稱，文駿已於上午十時許返家睡覺。時其父正在辦公時問，未及遄返家中詢問在外住宿之原因。比至晚間十時回寓，即至文駿房中（亭子間）探看，則見文駿面色慘白，已人彌留狀態，又見桌上置有安眠藥片空瓶四只，知係自殺無疑，急電海格路紅十字會醫院，召救護車送院施救，終因服毒過多，挽救乏術，未幾身死。</p>
<p>後經院方報告靜安寺分局，飭巡官孟瑞生警員張壽鑫按址前往其家調查，幷抄獲遺書三通，（一）致其雙親，（二）自殺自白書，（三）致知友龔甲龍函。遺書文字通順，其大要云：「兒承慈愛撫育及冠，念餘年來，披肝瀝胆，爲兒勞瘁，養育之恩尚未報，不孝遽爾輕生，素蒙寵愛，猝遭變故，自必哀慟渝恒，舐犢之情，固難遽釋，惟大數前定，生死有命，亦見自作自受，死者已矣，生者允宜珍重，望達觀處之，切弗過於哀戚，致損福體。」</p>
<h3>悱惻纏綿一紙書</h3>
<p>其自白書云：大致謂依據陰曆計算，我已是廿五歲的人了，年底將屆，又將加上一歲，但我決於廿五歲前死去，這是人生圖表土到達最高峯的時候，應該回去了。</p>
<p>爲何要自殺：失戀嗎？不！失業嗎？不！我是有相當職業的，生計逼迫嗎？亦不是！我每月有足够維持個人生計收益的，畏罪而死嗎？不！我從未作奸犯科，問心何愧之有？那眞正的原因呢？直截的說「我是已倦遊這人世，要到另一個樂園去」。</p>
<p>另有一事相托者，在明年我死去的一夜，在我房中　上供上一枝梅花，（不必一束）至第二天將花棄了，只須一次已够，第二年就不用再作了。因爲這梅花是另有象徵的。如果人死後，是無靈魂的話，這是我托你們代我供祭另一個人，這是我不能完成的第三年紀念，因爲我在第三年的時候，已不能到她墳頭一祭了。假如果眞有靈魂的話，我們在天國里終有相遇的一天。</p>
<p>還有遺留財物列表下列放在牆邊抽屜鐵匣內，用一〇〇號鑰匙開啓，計有現鈔百餘萬元，美票數元，西姆手錶一只，金戒一只等物。</p>
<p>據承辦警員語記者云，據調查所得，知葛文駿之死，實係殉情，彼有一愛人，情感彌篤，因格於家長之不同意，遂自殺殞命，葛乃誓不另娶，此次突然自殺，仍以此故，遺書由所謂「梅花」，即暗指伊人云。</p>

<h3>歲暮采風錄</h3>
<p>耶　已過，新年亦去，經採用陽層，已三十五年，但人民仍念念不忘於這古老的舊　法。在國曆新年中，除機關學校放假慶祝，及娛樂塲中較爲熱鬧外，實屬無事可紀。倒是這幾天大家在忙着準備過舊　新年，反來得有聲有色。</p>
<p>這每年一度的舊曆新年，在習俗上是很看得鄭重的，敬神，祭祖，要忙許多時候。上海過年的風俗，張春華有「滬城歲時衢歌」八首，茲錄其四以見昔日上海殘年中的景象。雖已「過時」，抑供談助。</p>
<p>果實羅陳列市街，</p>
<p>相傳六十日生涯，</p>
<p>山蔬也恐憎人聽，</p>
<p>嫩筍從來號繡鞋。</p>
<p>這是八首中的第一首描寫街頭景色。一般人家，過年總要都買一些東西，預備年底祭記，或新年中招待親友的。於是有許多臨時的攤販，來趕這年關的賣買。其中以南貨業更爲熱鬧，所以有「六十日店」的稱號。港習過年，笋乾不能少的。大片是山笋乾，在水中浸透之後，薄切成絲，與肉同煮，爲除夕必備之餚。笋之嫩者，因形似昔日婦女之小脚，故名「繡鞋底，」是很够香艷的。至今每逢年底，里衖間常有呌切笋乾者，亦是年底的一種臨時營業。</p>
<p>肩筐　籚入城呼，</p>
<p>村果村蔬載滿途，</p>
<p>底事茅擔齊　解，</p>
<p>料量祀灶買慈姑。</p>
<p>年底除了南貨店有好買賣外，附近的鄉人都　城來趕入。他們携了蔬果入城，換一點南貨回去過年，普通人家在年底也多備一點蔴果，因爲在新年中是買不到的。尤其是許多應時之物，更非買不可。像慈姑即是祀灶必須之品。</p>
<p>隱隱輕雷度短欄，</p>
<p>磨勻香稻雪同看，</p>
<p>却教織手爭奇巧，</p>
<p>果饀翻新鬭粉　。</p>
<p>粉糧爲年終應時食品故滬俗歲除，磨粉製糧。粉糧有乾濕兩種，濕者即是湯糧，乾者稱爲「金　」，乃在竹龍中蒸熟者。　中之餡，花式極多，普通爲肉，爲豆沙。但　中兒女，往往別出心裁，爭奇　巧，以各種昊實蔬菜製饀，亦食譜翻新之一端。</p>
<p>家家搏粉製年糕，</p>
<p>仿疑蘇台歲逐高，</p>
<p>入肆恍如秋八月，</p>
<p>桂花香細染寒袍。</p>
<p>粉糧和年糕，因爲歲尾年頭的點綴品。滬城中上之家，均　人製糕，搏粉入飴，捶製使堅，犬都爲長方形，顏色有紅白二種。更有收藏八月桂花，綴於糕面，名爲「桂花年糕」，香味更勝。今茶食店糕　舖中，均有年糕出售，「五步一樓，十步一閣。」到處皆是，再不煩住戶贅心。自行製糕的人家，恐已是極少數的了。</p>
<h3>香煙繚繞燭光熒熒　虹廟看善男信女　有福的神前燒香叩謝運蹇的膜拜求籤一番</h3>
<p>又到廢曆年底了，一年中，有多少」好福氣」的人，照例要到「菩薩」跟前去燒香叩謝，又有多少「命運日蹇」的人，要到「菩薩」跟前去「哭訴」一番，懇求「大慈大悲」的菩薩，明年給他交一步好運。</p>
<p>因此，到那兩天南京路上的虹廟，突然顯得熱鬧起來。</p>
<p>紅漆的大門，宮殿式的　　，擠在洋房大廈櫛比的南京路旁，特別的顯得不調和。每次經過，總感到有些兒滑稽。然而中國的任何事物，拆穿了，何嘗不都是如此矛眉可笑？</p>
<p>虹廟原名「保安司徒廟」，淞滬戰爭以前，還是跟鄉村破廟一塲的一脂粉不施」。後來善男信女們捐款重修門面，外表上才顯得美觀一些，但是裏邊仍和過去無異。</p>
<p>跨入　廟門，探上及兩邊牆上的「有求必應」「保守一方」之類的匾額就呌人眼花·門左擺着個整潔的攤頭，出售着「高盅觀世音經」「佛說阿彌陀經」「金剛般若波羅密經」等。再進去，就一眼望到那些「命相課館」裏的命相者，正在拈着鬍子，向坐在桌旁的顧客高談闊倫。另外有一扇門邊，掛着「XXX醫師內婦大方脈」的木牌。</p>
<p>殿堂　裏，香烟繚繞，堂上匾額，已被烟火黨得字跡糢糊，但是這兒光綫，却似乎比南市城隍廟稍勝一籌。濛濛一片烟氤中，正有許多人在點香插燭，跪拜求籤。這些人中，包括鷄皮鶴髮的老太太，燙髮的摩登女郎，憨態可掬的土老兒，靑布衫褲的苦力……。</p>
<p>踏進　「關帝殿」，只見黑臉的周倉，牽着、那匹赤兔馬，大概也爲了過年吧，赤兔馬也換上了新行頭，嘴裏啣着棵靑菜。出來走過大殿前，一個穿黑狐大衣圍上紅圍巾的女郎正在虔誠地叩着頭，記者好奇，順手在檯上籤筒裏抽了一根，是觀音籤第二十四籤。化了法幣二百元，在左邊櫃上換來了一張黃紙，一看却是個「下下」籤，上面印着：</p>
<p>「不成隣里不成家</p>
<p>永泡痴人似落花</p>
<p>若問君恩難得力</p>
<p>到頭畢竟事如麻』</p>
<p>兜了兜「生肖殿」出來，廟隣的香燭店正在趕修門面。數十年來，這爿舖子靠了虹廟發財，每逢農曆年底，廟宇裙屐翩翩例有人滿之患，這店號也擁擠不堪，大有「賓至如歸」之概。「過年」了，又該是做好生意的時候了吧！</p>
<p>元寶茶</p>
<p>社會上一片求財熱，舊歷新年，除耳邊充滿了「恭禧發財」一類義頌善禱之辭外，又用「元寶茶」敬客，取其口彩吉利。所謂元寶茶者，即將橄欖放在茶中。這靑色的橄欖，上口就是苦澀，面回味却淸香甘甜，所以一般人頗爲愛好。但下知是那個「指鹿爲馬」地稱之爲「元寶」，來迎合社會大衆討取士利心願。橄欖自得了「元寶」的雅號後，立即身價十倍，一到舊歷新年，飛漲起來，今年當然也不會落後。好在「元寶」是人人歡迎的，橄欖的價格雖增，仍到處受人重視。</p>
<h3>齊眞</h3>
<p>「祖宗雖遠，祭祀不可不誠。」宗法社會的我國，視先是不可忘的。歲尾年頭，生人固可及時行樂，已死者也得養祀一番，於是請出了祖宗的遺容，陳設果盤，糕點，酒菜，焚香燃燭，此即所謂「齋眞」。</p>
<p>祖先遺容，大都不是木炭晝的肖影，也不是拍攝的相片，而是一種畫軸，男的翎頂朝服，女的鳳冠霞帔，還有三代四代五代的集體圖像，明代裝束，古色古香。縉紳閥閱之家，四壁琳瑯滿目，而使邑廟中的寫眞館，甘拜下風。</p>
<p>遺容普通是從十二月二十五日掛起，過了元宵才收去，但也有僅掛年初五天的，除了家人跪拜之外，舊曆新年，至親往來，也得在遺像前磕頭，算是拜年。</p>
<h3>壓歲錢的故事　南陔五歲朝天子</h3>
<p>逢時過節，小孩子最快樂，逢年更使他們高興百倍。除了有好的吃，新的穿之外，在作揖叩頭後，還一一個紅封獲到手，此即所謂「壓歲錢」。一向只有消費而無收入的孩子們，壓歲錢可說是他們惟一大宗的財　。</p>
<p>今古奇觀上有一段「南陔王五歲朝天子的故事」據說是壓歲錢的起源。王韶的五歲幼子南陔，元夕從家人觀燈，爲奸徒負之而去，適朝上至上閣，南陔羣輯而呼之，賊被擒。上悅其　，賜金單錢果以壓驚。於是「年年壓歲，歲歲　錢」之風，一直流傳到現在。以後每近年關，大人以錢賜給小輩，成了份內之事。</p>
<p>古代的壓歲錢，很有意味，將銅錢穿了紅綠絲綫，紮成形形式式的花樣。兩頭尖尖作橄欖形者爲「元寶錢」，X形者爲「定勝錢」，此較普通。更有別出心裁，盡爭奇鬥巧之能事者皆用以博得口采。道種餽贈的壓歲錢，大戶人家，都由主管賬房核定。紮得很結實的銅錢，加上一串念珠，美其名爲「如意錢」，用燙金紅紙包好，蓋以錦匣。眞是一種時殊技巧。許多顧繡店中，專門代人包紮，也是婦女們的手工副業，可惜現在已找不到一二個能紮壓歲錢的人了。</p>
<p>過去銀元流行的時候，壓歲錢普通是一元。隨着物價的高漲，壓歲錢也漲價了。「年年壓歲，歲歲增財」。在這不景氣的年頭，支出的壓歲錢也不能算是小數。自銀元廢止後，花花綠綠的鈔票，似乎沒有銀幣那樣實惠，於是有人想出一種壓歲錢袋。紙幣塞進了梅紅封套，裝璜確實美觀。這價廉物美的壓歲錢袋，乃是紙店年終的好買賣。</p>
<p>幾位父親交遊較爲廣闊一點的小朋友，每年壓歲錢的收入，很是可觀。若能把這筆錢儲積起來作為　子們將來的敎育費，不是很有意義的麽？可　大都用以買食物，　玩具，甚　作處　搏之資，這是敎育上　得　究的一個問題。</p>
<h3>灶君的出典</h3>
<p>祀灶之風，由來甚古，　鼎上就有「　竭於灶」的一句話。那末究竟灶神是誰呢？周禮說，「祝融爲灶神。」淮南子說，「黃帝作灶，死爲灶神。」西　雜俎說，「灶神狀如美女。」眞是傳說紛紜，莫衷一是。另有一種有趣的說法，灶君俗名武吉，家貧，賣柴爲生，事母甚孝。一日，遇一相者，告其將有大禍臨頭，宜速趨避。詢趨避之法，則謂汝有百日牢獄之災，歸家以石灰畫地爲牢，百日再出可免。言畢，相者忽不見，武吉知有異，肩柴趦起不前。忽柴祖一端脫下，扁担擊中行人之首，立時斃命。武吉提　富裏去，　詢之下，以家有八旬老母，應請　回一省，官　其孝，姑釋之。歸家後　地為牢，坐地九十九日，復之官　，富　其何以失　不來，武吉以在坐賓　，調查　　，遂不加深究·吉死幀，因患　故，封灶君，為一家之主，監視　人言行，記其　　，以為賞　。如此云云。諮貸　之。</p>
<h3>十樣菜　家家必備</h3>
<p>十樣菜是上海人遏舊曆新年所必備的菜肴，用木耳，黃花采，豆芽，藕，胡蘿蔔，醬瓜，鹹白菜，笋，豆腐干等，一起炒的，無論大家小戶，都要炒上許多。尤其是人口較多的人家，差不多要炒上一缸，預備過年時吃，據說那幾種蔬菜，都含有很好的口彩。</p>
<p>此外稱黃豆芽爲「如意菜」，慈菇茡齊炒鹹菜「安樂菜」，塔棵菜爲「脫苦菜」，均是年節中的應時餚　，故賜以嘉名。</p>
<h3>臘冬花市　天竺寒梅爭艷競芳</h3>
<p>股紅的猩猩木，點綴着聖誕節，與綠色的聖誕樹和白色的雪花，相映成趣。聖誕節與新年相繼消逝了，猩猩木隨而凋　。代替他的是孤高的寒梅，紅實纍纍的天竺，黃酥的臘梅，淸秀窈窕的水仙，都是舊歷歲尾年頭的案頭清供。似乎比那猩猩木更來得淸雅。</p>
<p>塵嚣十丈的上海，是與圍藝絕緣的。偪仄的屋宇，已够受用了，更何來隙地三弓，給你蒔花種竹，做那怡情悅性的淸課呢。一般中上人家，要把房屋佈置得更美麗些，便到市塲上去選購花卉。在平日，花市塲上洋花充斥，薔薇，紫羅蘭，洋菊，百合，大理花等等，都是供應洋人和摩登士女的，此外喜慶用的花籃，喪事用的花圈，也是大宗賣買。</p>
<p>但是一到新年相近，平時不大受人注意的國產花卉，却在市塲上爭艷競芳了。除了應時的梅花，天竺，水仙之外。還有很精緻的盆景，在蒼老的樹樁上，透出些生氣蓬勃的枝葉，充滿着詩情畫意。</p>
<p>梅椿　「探梅」是文人們的韻事，鄧尉，孤山，不知吸引了多少遊客；不能雕開這煩嚣都市的人們，也想要弄幾枝盆景梅樁來點綴他的書齋和客廳，以示風雅。所以梅樁陳列在花市塲上的，着實不少。一枝枝古老剝蝕的柯幹，如靑銅，巖石，，龍蟠，虎踞，都繫着一朶朶含苞將放之花。有所謂劈梅的，好如插在柴塊之上，怪異之至。更有在梅花之旁，加上蒼松翠竹，成爲一幅歲寒三友圖的，尤爲人所歡迎。</p>
<p>天竺　天竺，在翠綠的葉　中，透露了一串串血紅的子實，象徵着新春的輝煌，帶來了前途的光明。買天竺當然要選那子實多的，因爲整個天竹，就美在這幾顆股紅的子上，可是有子無葉，也不免太單調了，綠葉的襯托，必不可少。賣花的人，將有子無葉和有葉無子的天竺，兩下併紮起來，就成爲一技十全十美的天竺，價錢也增高了許多。這是買花的人所當注意的。</p>
<p>臘梅　臘梅和天竺眞是天生的一對佳偶，當天竺子實轉紅的時候，也正是臘梅開花的時候，綠葉紅子，配以黃花，最是一幅動人的畫面。臘梅以素心而磐口者爲佳，因普通臘梅，紅心的多，所以素心較爲名貴，香味也很馥郁。市上臘梅，素心的尚多，磐口的却不常見，眞是美中不足。</p>
<p>水仙　號稱「凌波仙子」的水仙，也在這時來　熱鬧。一陣陣的淸香，好像在勾引路旁的行人。水仙有單瓣與重瓣之分，普通以爲重瓣的好，却不知單瓣的才是眞正的老牌水仙。在形式上講，又有直株與蟹爪之別，蟹爪是經人工做成的，故較名貴。在許多花店中，又有洋水仙陳列着，雖然放着五色燦爛的花，但總不如國產水仙之淡雅。</p>
<p>花市　歲暮花市，戰前的大本營在城隍廟，戰後移至二馬路望平街一帶，慈淑大樓的底下，成爲一年一度的花市塲。在外國墳山的圍牆上，簡直成爲一扇寒梅，天竺，臘梅所組成的大屏風，不能上鄧尉去孤山的人士，正不妨權把這裏作爲「探梅勝地」。今年城隍廟已是很熟鬧了，但慈淑大棋附近的盛况，想也不至於十分冷落。</p>
<p>花販　這裏的花，大都來自十餘里外的鄉村中。有的是鄉下人把他們所栽培的結晶品，乘這時期來博取一點過年費用，也有是花販子，從鄉下將花販到都市裏，來供應春節的需要。他們有的是靑年；也有老婆子；還有小姑娘，憑着伶俐的口齒，來應付他們的主顧。</p>
<p>價昂　在幾家大公司裏，花卉的交易，平時是很淸淡的，這幾天也熱鬧起來。陳列在公司中的鮮花，身價自與花攤上的大不相同，尤　其是專家們所栽培的盆景，在有藝術修養的人說來，是淸雅絕俗，但普通人一看他的價目，不免要吐舌了。</p>
<p>物價高漲，應時的蠟梅天竺寒梅，都要以萬論價了。因這不景氣的年頭，各業都顯得很蕭條，何況這被人目爲奢侈品的花呢。看來人雖擁擠，欣賞流覽的人雖多，而眞眞買花的人，却寥寥無幾罷！</p>
<h3>笋乾·綫粉　白糖·紅棗　路上人熙攘　難辦年貨忙</h3>
<p>這幾天，馬路上來往的人格外多，商店裏也擠得滿滿的，充分表示出過　年的景象。　年，吃年夜飯，請春酒，都需要許多東西，主婦們照例要爲這許多東西忙碌一番，稱爲辦年貨。各商店無不「利市三倍」其中如南貨店，香燭店，酒　店，　　店，理髪店，糕　店等，生意更爲興隆，還有許多臨時攤販，也趕這年關的好買賣。</p>
<p>南貨店在過年的時候，最是鬧熱不過，有的在店門口紮了彩，懸上一對地　燈，晚上大放光明。一曆曆的顧客，將櫃台圍得水洩不通。店是夥計，雖然臨時添加人手，還是忙得團團轉。笋乾，綫粉，白糖，紅棗，蓮子……等，一樣一樣的給顧客們「選」，「秤」，「包」。當幾個大主顧上門的時候，夥計們招待得格外週到，敬茶，敬瓜子，然後把客人所要買的東西，一一包紮好，倘是老主顧，還可以享受九折優待。假使是鄉下來的太太們，另有一包長生果或瓜子奉送。</p>
<p>香燭紙錠·依然難禁</p>
<p>香燭店是一種迷信的賣買，在平時每逢舊曆朔望，或神佛菩薩的誕辰，營業已很可觀，過舊年更是營業最忙之時。門面大都修飾得煥然一新，燃着蓮花油燈，以資點綴。蠟燭亦年關的大宗交易，今雖電炬通明，但家家戶戶，總須買幾對蠟燭，聊以應時。其他如神馬，元寶，紙錠，一堆堆的，都有很大的銷路。爆竹在香燭店中，也是應時之貨，除作敬神之用外，孩子們又把他拿來作玩意兒。</p>
<p>油鹽醬醋·整甏購備</p>
<p>所謂開門七件事，其中油，鹽，醬，醋四者，都要到醬園中去買，在平日酒醬店已和市民不能分離。在年底，需要更是激增，特別是敬神的酒和燒菜的油，幾乎比平時添了好幾倍。至少要備上新年中十天或半月之用，所以走進酒醬店的，大都是瓶子裹裝滿了出來。有錢的人家，整甏的酒，原箱的油，買來準備過年之用。</p>
<p>醃臘肉店·驟形熱鬧</p>
<p>本來生意很淸淡的醃臘店，這幾天也驟然地熱關起來。在年初沒有鮮肉可賣的時候，臘肉可以久藏，新年中偶爾來了客人，就可以很方便地拿來作為菜肴。這是過年的點綴品，美其名曰「家鄉肉」此時除原有的醃臘店外，還有許多臨時舖子只有一張桌面，一塊硬板，一開門便看見那貼着大减價的紅紙條兒。有的竟　了一班「堂名」在店堂裏吹吹打打，分外顯得熱鬧。</p>
<p>理髮店中，更有「賓朋滿座」之盛，雖然壁上貼着「同業公議，一律加倍」字樣，用的是桃紅色的紙張，特別顯目，可是上門的顧客，依舊絡繹不絕，因爲誰都不願在新年裏長髮蓬頭的啊。</p>
<p>歲時食品·首推年糕</p>
<p>年糕是名符其實的歲時食品，與端午的粽子，中秋的月餅，同樣地被人重視。許多糕爛店，把平日的工作，擱置一旁，專門來做年糕應市。茶食店的櫃台上，年糕也裝得高高地，而在許多新式的食品店中，年糕上面，又裝了許多文字，圖案，放在玻璃錦匣中，抬高了他的身份。在小菜塲旁邊，店堂的空隙裏，都有臨時的年糕作，這些大都是專做寗波年糕的。</p>
<p>除了上述的商店以外，其他像鞋帽，水果，糖菓，香烟，錫箔，服裝等店肆，營業都超過平時。小菜塲上，鷄鴨魚肉等，也比平日多。不過這祇是暫時的景象，上元一過，生意便平常了。</p>
<h3>主婦親自出馬無不滿載而歸</h3>
<p>辦年貨是由主婦親自出馬的居多，走入店中，受到笑臉逢迎，揀擇以後，盈筐滿筐，大包小袋，或用私人汽車，或喚部三輪車，無不滿戴而歸。但也有一般貧寒人家的妻室，因爲丈夫收入不多，用來辦年貨的款項，更屬有限，買這樣，缺那項，也煞費躊躇。俗話所說，「貧窮夫妻百事哀」，這一句話到了舊歷年關，更其顯著。不過，話又要說回來，凡是一個賢蓋的妻子，在今日這種艱難的局面之下，應該明白謀生的不容易，對於過舊年的習俗，切不要太認眞，隣家當室的豪華，並不足羨，能修和丈夫兒女，同叙一堂，才是人間的樂事，舉杯對飲，大家應爲新春祝福。</p>

<h3>財次徐柏圍聲稱　今年可謂為經濟建設年　產貸須運用得當　生產事業雖有賴於資金協助但必須各方面合作始克有濟</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕財政部次長兼四聯總處秘書長徐柏園，以生產事業貸款臨時審核委員會，於去年十二月十日成立以來，已屆一月，爲使各界明瞭該會近情起見，特於昨日下午四時，假中行大厦一樓四聯分處會議室，招待本市新聞界，徐氏發表談話如次：</p>
<p>此次生產事業貸款，係遵照宋院長迭次指示，積極協助生產事業發展之原則辦理之，一月以來，進行頗爲順利。委員會各委員，均係深負時望之社會領袖，公務忙迫，自不待言。而每星期三次之會議，均能躬自參加，認眞商討，此種公爾忘私之精神，誠堪欽佩者也。本人以爲生產貸款辦法，乃系今後金融經濟配合建設之一重大試騐，下列三點，尤堪注意：</p>
<p>（一）爲動員全體金副機構之人力，財力以協助工商事業之發展：過去有關推行國策之金融業務款責任，亦均享有向中央銀行轉抵押之權利。各商業行莊等對於往來有棄之工商東業，得按其項原則，不僅足以運用全體金融機構之力量，以協助生產事業之發展，並足以督促商業行荘努力正常業務之推進，引導資金於積極建設之途徑。尤其足以加強國家金融機關與商業行荘之聯系，齊一步驟，協力負担今後經濟建設之重任，至於商業行莊之責任問題，政府已有極爲合理之決定，當不使其因此反受困累也。</p>
<p>（二）為求充分發揮貸出資金之效果，俾能完全運用於正當生產事業之途徑，消極方面，必須避免不正當之運用。積極方面，必須發揮增產之作用。蓋經濟金融現狀，尚未達到完全穩定之境地，吾人固切望生產事業之發展，多方設法貸款協助。但如發生假借生產名義，貸得款項，而竟用於投機囤積之途徑時，實反足以危害整個社會之利益，減損生產事業之信譽，故本會事前審核，不能不審愼周詳，而事後考核，尤當力求嚴密。將來對於努力增產，確能妥善運用貸款，增加產量，改善品質之廠家，必綱續予以更大之協助，鼓勵其事業之發展也。至內部辦理手續，力求簡捷，一般申請案件，均在一星期內可以辦妥一切手續。工作人員，雖遇假期亦少休息，不致因審愼周詳，有所躭延。</p>
<p>（三）為求金融業務學政府及社會各部門之工作密切配合，共謀策進。要知生產事業之發展，除應予資金之協助外，賓有賴於行政及社會各方面之合作，始克有濟。例如技術之改進，勞資之協調，原料之供應，運輸之暢通，稅制之調整，以及社會輿論之督促鼓勵等，均有密切關係。自本會成立以來，深蒙政府有關部門及社會各方之協助，暨輿論界之鼓勵，工作人員均感興奮，深　能繼續發揮此種互相配合，互相協助之精神，爲我國生產事業前途，亦即經濟建設前途　定穩固之基礎，國計民生，裨益多矣。</p>
<p>總之，今後建設問題，應以生產爲第一。凡有利於生產之發展者，應盡力爲之。上海向居全　經濟之領導地位，尤望樹立楷模，爲全國示範。關於其他重要地區辦理生產事業貸款一事，亦蒙宋院長核定通則，並指定天津，北平·靑島·武漢·南昌·長沙·重慶·成都·昆明·廣州等地，一體舉辦，甚望興論界多多指導云。</p>
<h3>各地生產事業貸款通則</h3>
<p>至辦理各地生產事業貸款通則全文十一」條，業於本年一月九日，由四聯總處第三三四次理事會通過，其全文如次：</p>
<p>（一）凡經四聯總處指定之地區，應由國家行局及其他金融機關，依照本通則辦理生產事業貸款。（二）貸款對象，以左列事業爲限；1必需品產製工業。2礦業。3出口貿易物品產製工業。4當地特產業。5其他經核定之事業。（三）貸款性質，以協助各業必要之流動資金爲限，其添購機件設備等費用，應由各業自行籌措。（四）貸款押品，除原料成品外，得以機件設備，連同廠房基地，加入作押，但不得超過百分之五十。（五）貸款利率，應由各地四聯分支處，參酌當地情形，從低擬定息率，報講四聯總處核定之。（六）貸款期限，暫定爲六個月。（七）其他貸款條件，應參照上海區生產事業貸款各項辦法辦理之。（八）各業申請貸款案件，應各別提請當地四聯分支處，或請由各銀行代向四聯分支處申請之。（九）四聯分支處審核通過之貸款，其數額在五千萬元以下者，得交由當地銀行先行貸放補報備案。其超過五千萬元之放款，應逐案報請四聯總處核定。（十）凡經核定由各銀行承做之生產事業貸款，得向中央銀行按八折叙做轉抵押，轉押匯，或重貼現。（十一）省市地方銀行商業銀行錢莊等，依照本通則轉請當地四聯分支處核定辦理之生產事業貸款，幷准尚中央銀行按八折敘做轉抵押，轉押匯，或重貼現。（十二）本通則經四聯總處理事會通過施行。</p>
<h3>徐次長的解釋</h3>
<p>徐氏旋對該項貸款通則，略加解釋。渠稱：該項通則，原定條文共七條，後經宋院長指示，擴充至全文十二條。貸款對象，以製造工業爲主。第二條第五款之規定，所以表示貸款之對象，具有伸縮性，俾便其他經核定之事業，亦得申請貸款。惟如運輸公用等事業，以規模龐大，故並不包括在內。至貸款事件之處理，在上海以情形複雜，案件較多，故特在四聯分處之機構下，另設生產貸款會。至其他各地生產貸款案件，除由當地四聯分處主其事外，並可與當地之經濟部工商輔導處及商會等，取得聯繫，俾獲技術上之協助。各省市地方銀行，按財部管理銀行規則，本有協助地方生產事業之使命，故當能參加承辦當地之生產事樂貸款。至商業行莊對貸款可能發生之壞帳事件，徐氏認爲可不必過分過慮。蓋政府立塲，決不致因此而與商業行莊爲難。終望視事實情形如何、而求得合理之解決。</p>
<p>徐氏最後答覆各記者問題，茲誌其大要如次：（一）貸款所以僅限於各業必要之流動資金者，蓋在鼓勵已有成績之廠家，增加生產。而該項廠家，至少當須已有相當之固定生產設備，以備獲得貸款後，即能充份生產。（二）對各地貸款通則第九條五千萬元之規定，或以限額太小，此點將加檢討放寬。渠深望各地省市及商業銀行之人力財力，意用諸生產途徑，使今後金融業務得傾向協助生產事業。（四）關於貸款案件之審核，決一秉公開及嚴格之原則，以示公允。同時希望本市生產貸款辦理成功，使成爲各地之模範。（五）關於本市生產貸款會之組織；本屬臨時性質，希望能在一二月內予以結束。惟生產貸款之業務，仍將續辦不懈。本年可謂爲經濟建設年，故亟望生產貸款能與其他經濟情形配合，以促進國內生產事業，而完成國家之建　大計云。</p>
<h3>漢出口商要求增加結滙津貼</h3>
<p>漢市出口商近以物價　動，出口貿易，難於開展，特具建議書，分呈財經兩部，建議下列各點：（一）改革津貼制度辦法，需有一定限度，如出口能結百萬美匯者，由政府照官價給若干津貼，興時增加時，應以累進辦法貼補金額，如是雖國外物價設生差額，亦可以所得之津貼作爲彌補，（二）恢復戰時貿易委員會規定進出口聯鎖辦法，　政府嚴格管制進出口之際，凡進口商不易請得外匯者，得請准由出口商以出口物資換得之外匯，轉購此項進口貨，俾能以所得之利益，補償出口之損失。</p>
<h3>各國棉貨產量增加貿易競爭將甚激烈</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十日電〕最近國際紡織品情形之重大變化，應推十二月卅一日華盛頓聯合紡織品委員會之結束，及出口保留制之取消。近數年來聯合紡委會會以英國·美國·加拿大·印度及巴西之棉貨「配」往各亟需市塲，（然辦法實施時，仍由各政府決定），又出口保留制最近曾迫美國棉紗品製造商將產量特予保留若千數量，備充輸出。一九四七年第一季美國之大批輸出量，不過係一種限額，海外各國能否獲得，實難遽加保證，大槪須視各該國能否以金錢或情誼在美國國內市塲上，高價競購爲斷，然任何國家實無力與美國作金錢方面之競購。故美國自將輸出，以維持其在海外市塲上之情誼，惟是否能達二三〇百萬碼之數，仍待事實證明。一九四六年巴西及印度以國內荒歉頻仍，曾長期停止輸出，僉信美國出口量已遠在總限額之下。巴西及印度業已恢復輸出，而以棉貨輸出之歐洲各國，已較一年前爲多。日本亦正由麻痺狀態復甦，故國際棉貨貿易之數量及國際競爭之範圍，已日漸增長。</p>
<h3>銀錢業聯凖會　辦理公庫證拆放　調劑各行荘年關頭寸</h3>
<p>本市銀錢業聯合準備會，係全市銀錢業所聯合組織，各會員銀行錢莊，均繳付準備財產，如房地產等，以充實各行莊之準備，此項繳存之準備財產，經過評價，並在地政局登詎後均發給公庫證，可憑證向該會拆放。現因曆年關即屆，該會爲調劑銀錢業頭寸起見，加紫辦理公庫證拆放，其拆放利率，均照市塲規定利率計寡云。</p>
<h3>本市銀錢業　緊縮信用放款</h3>
<p>廢曆年關，轉瞬將屆，本市銀錢業方面，爲防止倒閉惡風起見，故紛謀緊縮信用放款，以减輕風險，頃悉：川幫住滬各行莊，近來對放款方計，亦開始緊縮措置云。</p>
<h3>搬拆日本工廠　作為賠償用　麥帥總部已凖備</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京十日電〕麥帥總部今日宣稱，關於搬拆日本工廠機器作為賠償事，此間尚未接到訓令，一俠訓令到達，自當立即辦理。麥帥總部現已指定日本工廠約一千所準備拆運，惟運輸手續實爲一大問題，何國供給船隻運送此項工業設備至要求賠償各國，尚不可知，中國及菲律賓均無船隻，將來或須借用美國船隻運送。至於已經指定千餘所日本工廠機器如何分配已開列淸單，惟尚未作最後決定。按華盛頓方面，國務院及陸軍部於九日宣布，美國決定立即搜取日本賠償，蘇聯及其他戰時盟國如不同意，亦所不顧。據國務院遠東司代理司長彰飛爾稱，即將向麥帥發出緊急訓令，立即開始搬拆日本工廠及其設備，作爲賠償之用，陸軍部次長彼得生亦稱，將及早通知麥帥及日本政府何種工業應留於日本，俾日人用以依據現實的基礎，圖謀經濟復興，而不再依靠美國資助，此種舉動雖當通知遠東委員會，但不必待其正式核准。日本方面佔領軍，美國有十二萬四千名，英國有四萬名，彼得生並稱，美國已運往日本之糧食，共計二百餘萬噸應由日本償付云。</p>
<h3>著名經濟學家凱恩　評論中國經濟　預算不能平衡　為惡化之主因</h3>
<p>〔合衆社香港十一日電〕著名經濟學家凱恩撰文載「遠東經濟評論」稱，中國目前經濟混亂之最大因素，厥為預算不能平衡。</p>
<p>凱氏列舉中國之資財如下；</p>
<p>（一）中國境內之敵產，數額「驚人」，不能作可靠之計算。</p>
<p>（二）日本用款項及其他物品償付之直接軍事賠款，僅工廠一項，中國已可分得約廿億美元。</p>
<p>（三）賦稅收入增加，政府目前征稅已「視戰前高至無從比較。」</p>
<p>（四）聯總加惠於中國，僅現款一項，將達十億美元物資，藥品或工業化學品不計在內。</p>
<p>（五）美軍在華，耗費大量款項。</p>
<p>（六）收復東北與台灣，兩地資　「龐大」。</p>
<p>（七）外國在華投資，美國政府興私人企業均願在華作長期投資，但「內戰長此存在，即無人期望將資金沉淪於中國。」</p>
<p>（八）華僑匯款回國，估計一九四六年其數不致在一億美元以下。</p>
<p>凱恩估計不利因素爲下：</p>
<p>（一）工資「過高」。</p>
<p>（二）政府未有明確政策，致使國家富頗多損失。</p>
<p>（三）交通不便，現因敗壞與中共破壞，益形惡劣。</p>
<p>（四）高利貸與高稅率，摧毀地方工業。</p>
<p>（五）走私損失關稅及不能控制某數類商品之運入。</p>
<p>（六）出口不足，出口乃「重建經濟平衡之主要因素。」一九四六年最初六個月，上海出口僅及進口百分之十三，此在一九三七年，則爲百分之八十九。</p>
<p>（七）內戰消耗中國預算經費百分之七十五，「除非却除是項重大負担否則經濟勢必續趨惡化。」</p>
<p>凱氏末稱「坦白言之，中國經濟已惡化至頗難立刻納入正軌之程度。」</p>
<h3>染料與顏料　名稱混淆不分商會勸導改正</h3>
<p>顏料染料，原爲兩物，本市因經營染料商號市招及公會名稱誤稱顏料，致與顏料商號混淆不分，市商會據國產顏料雜貨業公會聲請後，於昨日下午二時，召集兩業代表談話，計到國產顏料雜貨公會代表（顏料業）王伯恒，傅直高，顏料業公會（染料業）代表單良玉，王鵬程，商會由潘士浩，吳紀春兩君主持，首由顏料業代表王伯恒申述，顏料染料兩物，不特政府早經法定分類，即經濟部王部長手訂之最新化學工業大全亦已區別甚明，世界各國亦均定有專名，不相混淆，本市因經營染料商號誤用顏料市招，及該業公曾誤稱顏料業公會，致使分別甚明之顏料染料混淆不分，際此工業建國時期，顏料染料同爲現代重要工業商品，自應建議政府迅將經營染料之顏料公會改正爲染料業公會，顏料靛靑牌號，改正爲染料靛靑，庶幾名實相符，糾紛永息，而與各國名稱又相符合，否則如任其混淆，不特購衆無所適從，而影響國際貿易及敎育建設允鉅云云，繼由染料業代表述稱本業經營商品，確爲染料，然因本市狃於習慣，一旦更正，殊多不便，堅不允改，至此商會代表告以貴業經營商品旣爲染料，則公會名稱及商號市招，自應分別改正，以重實際，奈因該業堅表異議，雖經一再勸導，會議仍無結果，事後據國產顏料雜貨公會代表告記者，顏料染料無論商品，性質，用途，均屬各殊，染料業方面，似不宜堅持，狃於習慣，托其混淆，本業爲適應實際，自將織續請求主管機關及社會專家合理調整云。</p>
<h3>工資高昂·高利剝削　絲繭事業復興困難</h3>
<p>據某蠶絲業鉅子談稱：我國　絲事業，反不如臘敗後日本之盛，已爲整人皆知之事實，至於去年二次收繭　絲，因工資之高昻，又受高利貸之剝削，致使廠商均虧蝕甚鉅，政府雖貸款救濟，又以三百八十萬之代價收買製成春絲，惟仍不能維持，中信局收買成絲，巳陸續運銷國外，換取外匯，現美國市塲，D級絲價，每磅六·七五美元，每担以一三三磅計，合美金八百餘元，若購黃金運回，（每絲一担可易黃金二十餘兩）二轉手問盈利倍徒，而成政府賺錢，農商　蝕之情况，長此以往，絲繭事業復興殊爲困難云。</p>
<h3>財部籌設瀋陽海關</h3>
<p>東北一部份已恢復秩序，工商業及進出口貿易，亦漸趨繁榮，財政部爲增稅源計，首將瀋陽海關設立，並在長春錦縣設支關，惟九一八以前，潘陽未設海關而設於大連，現時大連爲自由港，就地形論，瀋陽位於大連之項背，故大連暫不設關。又東北尚有濱江·延吉·安東各地，待時局好轉，均將相鐵成立。</p>
<h3>津市紗布　價格飛揚</h3>
<p>津市最近紗布價格堅挺，雖經中紡拋售，仍未中落。據悉滬上自紡管會提高紗價後，細紗頓見上漲，滬帮鑒於津紗較賤，來此採購者甚衆，致此間價格堅俏。棉布因張綏等地缺貨，際此冬寒，需要迫切，布價劇漲，較津每疋高一萬五千元，故各商經營者往返甚夥，聞每日運張布疋達五十餘包云。</p>
<h3>呢羢近况萎疲　年外預測可轉好</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕最近黃金白米香烟綢布火油等價，不斷上漲，獨呢絨不漲反跌，究其主要原因，本客埠受高利貸壓迫而講賬倒閉者，旣日有所聞，年關迫近，銀根逼緊，銀錢業亦有倒閉，實銷已成尾聲，美國貨大蠶湧到，　出者夥，人心虛弱，麥爾登前因許可證簽出延阻，致市價一路向榮，及至同業中大批掛到，價乃逐步下跌，綜窺上月之市况，堪稱銷鈍價疲之局面，而美國貨在目今之呢絨市塲上，頗占有優勝重要地位，苟各方再不密切扶助聯絡，國貨勢必難以立足，且高利貸不滅，工商界俱有破產之危。但就呢絨業之前途而論，業中人預測萬歷年底過後，市面必然看好，因購結外匯困難，申請許可證又不易，向國外定到，勢必大缺，本廠貨生產則受原料（因羊毛禁止進口）及用電與工資和捐稅開繳關係，成本昻而出品必寡，故呢絨貨價目前雖較過去高峰時爲低廉，祗屬一時之現象云。</p>
<h3>桂元肉軋缺</h3>
<p>雜路桂回近以到數不多，更據泉州電訊，辦價又升六萬元，故申市略堅，大粒開四十一萬二千元至四十二萬元，普通四十萬左右，中粒二十五萬五千元。</p>
<p>桂元肉因現貨軋缺，故有奇貨可居之勢，近日號盤開過石碼元肉七十萬元。</p>

<h3>本市中敎聯誼會　昨晚招待新聞界　為敎職員生活問題呼籲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市市立中學敎職員聯誼會，於昨日下午五時，假威海衛路新生活俱樂部，邀請本市新聞界聚餐，目的在於藉以連絡感情，並冀新聞界能隨時寄予同情，作多方之呼籲。因該會曾以目前敎職員每月僅得二十五萬元左右之俸給，一家生活實難以維持，爰即向市府當局一再請求援助，吳市長甚表同情，而苦於市庫支絀，碍於參議會成案，力不從心，愛莫能助，磋商經月，結果毫無。</p>
<p>暫不罷敎忍飢耐寒</p>
<p>於是不得已即召開各校代表大會，本決於本月六日起，一律罷敎，結果因鑒於學生學業爲重，局長至誠相感，遂暫願作飢寒交迫之徒，不忍爲名敎罪人，遽爾作總請假之舉。然今後該會仍決憑過去之精神，以求貫澈此次這要求，而安同仁之最低生活，彼等要求之最後目標，爲以物價指數爲薪津倍數，要求政府把中學敎員當作技術人員看待，將薪津提至最高標準。又該會最近已向市參會建議，下學期起，向學生征收敎師福利金，然敎育局顧局長則主張改爲「敎師學術進修補助費」，款由市庫負担，然尚須待市參會之通過。</p>
<p>希望市長諾言兌現</p>
<p>關於發放寒衣津貼五十萬元一事，經吳市長聲明須有先例可援，且必須有具體設據，報上消息不足爲憑。現該會覺得市長此項聲明，不甚盡然，因中敎聯非淸查團，不能調卷行文，何從獲得證據，故彼等希望吳市長能充分同情公敎人員之疾苦，維持其政治家之一貫風度，對此諾言，即予兌現。</p>

<p>球賽於難童樂隊「雙鷹旗下」曲終後開始，東華於聯賽中六戰六勝，昨日似以新冠軍姿態應戰羣雄，全隊合作默契，韓龍海竄勢驚人，昨曾兩建奇功，孫錦順鐵腿依舊，東華攻勢雖猛，奈混合後衛森嚴，門將麥尼蒂拉蒂鋼門二座，鐵腿遇鋼門，毫無辦法。昨日混合隊人才濟濟，事屬義賽，同時又爲埠際代表隊之選拔賽，故各人都施展渾身解數，格外賣力，小黃毛勞勃司扶夫雄風依舊。昨日勝負之分，前鋒東華勝混合，而守衛則東業遠告不如，自無法抵禦也。混合麥尼蒂上拉蒂下曼亞里司堡雪逢　勃利尼陳效平卡普司汀卡洛列區雷樹萍下勞勃司托夫鮑傑上雜拉東華劉顯漢李寗上莊友仁下莊友仁上林文虎下韓龍波鐔福楨於洽興李垚孫錦順戴麟經上韓龍海陳明哲下賈幼良</p>
<p>五分鐘內東華失陷</p>
<p>笛聲響處，角逐開始，混合初次聯合作戰，聯絡默契未熟之際，東華攻勢頻頻，李垚首射稍偏，門右出界，繼而幼良邊底鉤回，高球一只，龍海倒身鈎射，又偏右未中。東華全軍推進過前，混合維拉得機帶入調中，卡洛列區，接住猛蹴，去如流星，劉顯漢騎馬蹲　式，立於門右，球竟由左面刺入，撲救不及輸去一城，時僅五分鐘耳。混合再攻，黃毛飛腿帶入一球，順勢射門，稍高碰楣彈回，混合諸將擁入，莊友仁不慌不忙，倒地鈎出，化險爲夷，博得掌聲不少，東華諸將怒髮冲冠，阿戴率領三軍，羣起振作，攻入混合腹地，幼良兩次射門，均爲麥尼蒂抱住。</p>
<p>既成平手又吿落後</p>
<p>未幾林根後方送出一高球，阿戴似有表演之意，憑空躍起，倒身頭上鈎傳李垚，堪稱妙絕。李垚接住猛蹴，平射砲彈一般，直飛門左，奈鋼門麥尼蒂，表演不讓麟經專美於前，縱身前飛，撲抱來球，鏡顯極爲精彩。廿五分鐘時孫鐵腿，得隙傳於李垚，盤球直進，龍海飛竄而至，一撥而入，扳成各一平手，於是雙方，你爭我奪進於混戰局面。四十分時，李垚切中，麥尼蒂衝出抱住，連跑數步，被判爲籬笆球，鐵腿操刀未獲成功。前半時塲終前，球在東華門首亂轉，雙方戰將，混做一團，只戰得人仰馬翻，球突飛右，卡普司丁佳機來到，四顧無人，將球按住，描個正準，遂建一功，前半時二比一，東華落後。</p>
<p>顯漢到戈連輸四陳</p>
<p>易陣調將再戰，拉蒂調出麥尼蒂，混合聯絡漸有描頭，四分鐘時，雷樹萍帶球沿邊疾進，傳予黃毛，越過張莊二關，順勢一蹴，稍高碰門楣下落，適顯漢躍起未獲，回身之際，碰個正着，糊里糊塗彈入，倒戈又獻一城。十分鐘時，黃毛又接得幼良一球，適張莊二衛迎面站立，將球帶回，飛起左脚，又鵠命中，四比一，東華連輸四城，羣情激憤，大起反攻，幼良明哲，屢有攻門，拉蒂生意興隆，十五分時，李垚發角球，陳効平躍起一頂再頂，海龍飛起便射，又為拉蒂　住，後幼良得球切中，海龍意欲頭上開花未果，礈門楣上出界。十八分時，勃里尼前傳予黃毛，為林根截住去路，黃毛傳左，維拉脚起球落，飛入東華網內，五比一混合天下已定。</p>
<p>心有未甘奪回一城</p>
<p>東華心有未甘，未幾鐵墮高球調前，拉蒂衝出救險，龍海腿快，捷足先登，眼看空城一座，奈心高球亦高，逾門出界。東華再接再厲，廿七分時海龍於混合門前力射，拉蒂未防此着，遂被攻入，成二比五。此後雙方互有攻守，東華五鋒前進，奈混合洋人，力大勁　，終未得獲，迨法定時間告終，常勝軍以二比五慘遭混合毒手。</p>

<h3>紐約年景　跳動了世界心臟忙煞了「紐約客」　一個預測　五年後全市人口定將超出一千萬</h3>
<p>— 十二月廿五日紐約航訊　本報駐美特派員毛樹清</p>
<p>聖誕節前三天的下午，雪花飄遍了紐約，寒風從赫特遜河掠過市空，揪動着馬路兩側斑駁的落葉。銀白色的世界，給『紐約客』帶來了新奇，也帶來了年節之感。</p>
<p>美國孩子們穿着鮮紅碧絲的毛絨衣，到處滑雪溜冰，打雪戰。中年人和老年人，並不因爲『初雪』而蜷伏，相反的，因爲過節，人們更顯得忙碌起來。</p>
<p>送禮繁忙　郵局開日夜班</p>
<p>無綫電不斷廣播　聖誕禮物的廣告，聰明的商人們，把什麽都編成了『節禮』。五塊錢一套的睡衣一塊半一雙的尼隆（Nylon）絲襪，八角五分錢一匣的巧克力糖菓，商人們把它川紅綠油光紙包紮起來，再裝到送禮的郵寄紙匣裏去。郵政局開了日夜班，加雇了臨時職員，包裹處的窗洞門前，站在一字長蛇陣的行列，他們祗須用二角三角的郵費，便可以把一大包節禮，平平安安的送到親戚家裏。</p>
<p>資本主義的社會，一切都是商品，商品便成了送禮的工具，文化事業也沒有例外，「讀者文摘」，在戲院裏，在報紙上，登了很大的廣告。『送年禮的最理想禧的，訂贈讀者文摘全年」。許多婦女與家庭之類的雜誌，替成千成萬的主婦們，設計各種價廉，特美，而又能使對方稱心的禮品。</p>
<p>百老匯路三十四街口，猶如上海南京路西藏路的轉角，那兒有三家最大的紐約百貨公司，『曼賽」『塞克斯』和『琴白』，跟大新公司一樣的滾筒式電梯上，上上下下都爬滿了人。穿的，喫的，日用的，乃至於小孩玩的，數不盡的物資，跟點不淸的鈔票，繼續不斷的在飛舞。雇客之中，大部份是主婦，也有不少古稀耳順的老太太，她們戴著幾萬種式樣，而沒有兩頂完全相同的帽子，穿著不同顏色的衣服，在人堆中穿梭似的來往。上帝創造聖誕節是含有深意的，他一定會看到那些虔誠的『芸芸衆生』而歡笑。</p>
<p>時報廣場　滿是紅燈綠酒</p>
<p>聖誕老人很早就光臨到這座全世界最大的都市。在大紐約，幾十萬個玻璃廚窗內，都剪點著「聖誕老人」。時報廣塲有喇叭播放的聖誕老人的福音，灌到人山人海的行人耳中。這一塊「方寸地』，從淸早到半夜三四點鐘，永遠是背推著背，摩肩接踵的。大雪夜，還是熙熙攘攘。多少美國農村裏出來的年靑姑娘，一踏進紐約，找著警察便問：『對不起，你能告訴我怎樣上時報廣塲去嗎？』</p>
<p>她們多半在時報廣塲上，（亦譯作泰烟士廣塲），遇著了喝醉了的水兵，水兵音樂播著每一個酒吧間的角落。五分錢一枚　幣，投入內動的收音機，便有五分鐘的靡靡之音可以享受。威士忌，軒萊，康涅克……酒是美國孩子的生命，酒，胭脂，和香水的氣味，揉和在一起。</p>
<p>飛船映雪　蔚為空中奇觀</p>
<p>五色繽紛的霓虹燈，照亮著不分晝夜，夏天冷飲品的霓虹燈廣告，仍舊閃煉著時報廣塲的一隅。紙約時報的電光新聞報導，比看第二天的報紙，還要快上好幾個鐘點，那一家的街頭卡通優影，常常吸引著新到的旅客，竚足團觀。</p>
<p>戰爭過去了，飛船變成了百貨公司最好的廣告。晚上，時報廣塲的天空，飛船帶着聖誕禮品的電光廣告，在空中徐徐環繞飛行。大雪夜，飛船的燈光，映着雪景，在半空中成爲奇觀。</p>
<p>煤礦罷工　紐約下令節電</p>
<p>紐約人圾長懼的一個人，恐怕就祇煤礦工顯路易士了。紐約人講起路易士，講起路易士那兩道濃眉，硬是有點『談虎色變』。沒有人能控制紐約時報那麼些霓虹燈，但是，只要路易士一句話，那些霓虹燈都熄了顏色。上個月，路易士忽然命令四十萬煤礦工人罷工，紐約市長奧祖　，立刻下令節約用電，霓虹燈一律『矇光』，時報廣塲有兩三個星期，一片漆黑，市長的侖令是節約用煤，以長期抵制路易士的罷工。有兩家公司，偸偸的開放廣告燈光，被市政府嚴厲處以罰款。</p>
<p>路易士命令復工的那天，紐約不少商人，高興得跳起來。商人們一高興，紐約社會，便似乎右了生氣。工商社會是工商第一，工商界便是社會的中堅。</p>
<p>人口激增　市區納胃不佳</p>
<p>戰爭帶給美國的繁榮，是不可用數字計算的。紐約人口，馬上就要超出八百萬，原來紐約的大都市形態，處處已經顯露着不够容納。就不稅嚴重的『房荒』問題吧，單說交通規則，就已經使市政府頭痛。美國是汽車工業的『娘家』紐約全市的汽車，就不知道有若干千萬輛。因之，行軍和停車都成了問題。三個多月以前，市長下令市中心區一段，從第二十三街到第五十九街之間，絕對禁止路旁停車，證拜六晚間和禮拜天例外。許多人犯了法，被處罰大洋十五元。</p>
<p>新鮮計劃　建地下停車塲</p>
<p>於是，許多汽車的主人，都寗願把車子關起來不用，地道火車，從淸早到傍晚，從黃昏到第二天黎明，沒有一個鐘點，不是擠得像沙丁魚一樣。市中心區內，寥若晨星的幾個停車塲，停車一小時，收大洋七角五分，但是沒有一刻鐘‘不是擠滿着汽車。前兩個月，奧祖華市長，去舊金山遊覽了一决，對那邊的「地下停車塲』大加讚賞，回來就決定要在紐約內，建造大規模的地下停車塲三處，每處能同時停車兩萬輛，但是，計劃是有了，「但聞樓梯響，不見人下來』！</p>
<p>小心開車　電台雪夜廣播</p>
<p>上海市內的交通成問題，紐約市內的交通管制更成問題。儘管紅綠燈的信號是那麽明顯，但是，撞車案幾乎隨時都難免。美國人天生急性子，儘管前面是紅燈，還有許多汽車偸跑，行人偸跑。在華盛頓，市政府有一道規定，如果逢到紅燈穿馬路，必須受罰大洋十元。但是，在紐約，愈是能在紅燈底下穿過去，愈是有辦法的『英雄』。紐約開汽車的人，動輒按喇叭，有時候，一字長蛇陣行進，第一輛車停下來，後面的喇叭，夾七雜八，宛如馬路音樂演奏會。這些情形，在英國，法國，是絕對看不到的。『美國是一個太年靑的國家』許多歐洲過來的中年人或老年人，都作如此的感嘆！</p>
<p>年夜，大家彼此都忙，原來性子急的人，免不了更急。聖誕節前三天的白雪皚皚，更阻礙了他們預定的交通。賴伽第亞飛機塲，有　百十三架民航機，因大雪不能啓飛，許多人原先想到邁阿密，洛杉磯度聖誕的，臨時都變了計劃。紐約的火車，到達時間，至少遲誤一點鐘，因為大雪，所以都開得慢。市政府的交通局員說得那樣婉轉：『小心你車輪底下的積雪，紐約市內，已經有二英寸厚了！在上紐約，（即紐的州北部），有的到八英寸了。雪是那樣滑，趕快减低你的速度，慢慢的，慢慢的，雖然這樣，你會遲到一小時，但是，安全不是更重要嗎？』</p>
<p>然而，第二天終於揭曉了。一夜間，大紐約市內，因下雪而釀成的撞車翻車案，一共有二十六起。</p>
<p>買票隊伍　長可繞幾條街</p>
<p>記者也是預定想開車到佛傑尼亞海濱度聖誕的一個，大雪，阻害了我們的計劃。</p>
<p>在紐約的過年是寂寞的，許多在紐約謀生的人，年節都回到了家鄉。但在另一方面，紐約的年景，也是熱鬧的。聖誕節前後的日子，戲院塲塲客滿。規模不大的歌劇院，買票比什麽都難。時報廣塲四周的幾家小戲院，映些流行的新片子：『久別新婚』『親愛的克娜蒙汀』以及卡通片『南方之歌』等等，每塲都門庭若市，全世界最大的電影院『無綫電大厦」，在放映電影以外，配稱着今年塲面最偉大的聖誕歌舞，買票的隊伍，長得環繞幾條街，不但星期天這樣，星期一星期二也是一樣長。被美國社會狂熱崇拜着的女星殷格立，勃克門，最近從洛杉磯被重金禮聘到紐約，在一家戲院演話劇，據說，訂座的票子，已經賣到明年二月。</p>
<p>世界首都　將在紐約形成</p>
<p>世界最大的都市，簇擁着世界最大的塲面。歲尾年頭，市政也在新陳代謝的革新，許多人討厭電車，因爲電車太髒而聲音嘈雜，現在很多已被取消了。百老匯路上，新型的紅黃兩色的公共汽車，招搖過市。　聯合國首都搬離紐約的討論中途，紐約人多多少少覺得有點『慢客』和『丟臉』，粵祖華市長，緊緊拉住了大財兼羅基斐洛，煤油大王的孫子，慷慨捐出了八百五十萬，給聯　國收買市東河沿岸的地皮，道一個未來的世界首都，將興築在全世界最繁華的方寸地區——漫海　。『五年之後，紐約的人口，定將超出一千萬』，我看見一張小型報紙上，這樣預測。</p>
<p>各代表團　紛紛遷入大樓</p>
<p>年底，各國派遣駐聯合國的代表團，都在紛紛忙着搬家，美國政肘，爲了使各國代表團聚集一起，辦事方便起見，特地撥劃了『摩天大樓』第六十三，第六十四，第六十五三層，作爲紐約的『東交民巷』。中國代表團，程了第六十三層的地皮七千五百方英尺，月化租金七千美金。聽規，英國代表團租了兩萬方英尺，他們的排塲和氣派，當然更町觀。</p>
<p>無疑的，紐約現在威了世界的心臟，心臟每一分鐘，每一秒鐘的脉動，影響着全世界的動態。一九四六年，轉眼就算過去了，八百萬紐約人，他們在期待一個更繁榮，更安定，更富足的一九四七年！（聖誕夜寄）</p>

<h3>四川三患　貪污·烟毒·土匪</h3>
<p>十二月廿七日航訊　本報駐蓉記者周學端</p>
<p>天寒風凍，急景殘年，勝利復員，又是一載！經過連賽冬雨，成都季候倍增寒冷。這幾天過逢四川省參議會在　舉行三次大會，在寒風一角，來自各縣的參議員，帶來全川五千萬人的凄切呼聲，從這些呼聲中，聽到年來四川社會灰暗，汚濁與不安定的種種悲調，這恰似一股寒流，更壓低了四川季候的冷酷空氣。</p>
<p>今年是復員年，四川甫徑八年抗戰，社會在極度動盪中，力求安定復原，但今年省政建設，着眼側重於年來建設的計劃與推動，加以年來丙亂未已，烽烟不息，全國秩序未盡安定，四川社會的基本秩序，始終未能安定恢復。省參議會前幾天程序是省府代主席部錫俠暨各廳處長的施政報告，和參議員的質詢。從報告裏，確實看到年來四川政治的種種進步，從質詢中，又看到四川社會的種種弊害，由於這兩種矛盾對照，記者意味到四川目前的政府與社會尚不無脫節的地方，由此反映目前四川社會混亂與不安定的一般情形。</p>
<p>肅清貪污　整飭政風</p>
<p>省參議會開幕時，七七商齡的曾省齋參議員痛切陳詞，指出四川今日最嚴重之三大患爲烟匪與貪汚。四川當前社會現象是盜匪遍地，民不聊生，賄賂公行，貪污成風，烟毒熾烈，川東各縣不僅鴉片瀰漫，白麵，嗎啡，梭梭更隨處皆是。首先是澄淸吏治與肅振貪汚，關於振肅政風與貪汚案件，參議員質詢最爲激烈，民政應長陳開泗首當其衝，縣長貪汚在四川已視爲故常，而案件發生後，省府僅以一紙公文調職了事，此為全川所最致不滿者。如川省最荒僻窮陋的沫愛設治局，首任局長李惟樂最近貪污計冒領職員薪金六百七十七萬餘元，食米及黃穀六百五十餘石，私收田糧一千一百餘石，吞蝕鄉鎭儲蓄同盟勝利公債獻金契稅及壯丁安家費共二千六百餘萬，外獻糧一千餘石，現奉調沫川。但迄今仍爲地方人士扣留不放。又如前合江縣長貪汚特種工程費數逾億萬，案發數月，迄今仍無下落。其他貪汚案件比比皆是，始終未聞政府曾作澈底處置。再如政風問題，縣長表率一縣，自應持身謹飭，以資楷模。參議員檢舉出兩位現任縣長的風流事件，一是開縣縣長曾仲成，因爲未婚妻在當地風流太甚以致不安於任，一是內江縣長黃希濂，因爲與夫人發生爭妒情事，打得頭破血流，鬧得滿城風雨。又如縣長任意草菅人命，如古宋縣長李才貴寃殺無辜靑年三人，視民如敝屐，引動全縣公憤。這一連串的實例，說明了當前四川政風的敗壞和貪汚的盛行。關於財政方面，今年川省財政改制，大部直接稅劃歸地方，各縣新增稅捐處，機構異常龐大，稅征難免流弊，參議員請財政廳長鄧漢祥拿出良心來，可吾保證稅吏不會發生貪汚行爲，鄧廳長乾脆答覆：「祗能保證自己」。大會中民財詢問佔去二日，詢問案六十餘件，主要是涉及貪汚與政風，一般參議員公認目前四川庶政推行，中心在於澈底澄淸吏治與振肅官常，除去提供貪汚事實外，他們一致希望政府縣長的甄選，任用，考核，獎懲與解調職務，能有法律的標準繩墨，縣長養廉，應有切實保證。但是主要的對於貪汚，更應作澈底與嚴厲的執法以繼，這是四川人民當前最迫切的呼籲與要求。</p>
<p>萬事莫如保安急</p>
<p>復員後的四川治安問題，來自各縣的參議員多以身歷景况，發出迫切呼籲，有的甚至揮淚陳詞，痛哭報告。目前四川治安廠結，首先是匪風熾烈，大小股匪，出沒無當，刧車刧塲，司空見慣，人槍在千餘支以上者爲五區巨匪胡國光八區巨匪瞿白階十四區巨匪凌伯淸十六區巨匪馬士義等，嘯聚山林，橫行郊野，爲患經年，迄未絞平，問保安處何以自圓其說？其次是保安部隊軍風紀，參議員紛紛指出各地保安隊時有利用職權，搔擾民間，甚至包庇烟毒，勾結地方惡勢力滋作惡害等事。未保安先擾民，問政府當局注意及之害？王保民參議員甚至涕泗泣請鄧代主席及保安處王元暉處長發出救人救世的菩薩心腸，迅速安定治安，解民倒間。</p>
<p>王元暉處長在答覆中報告了本年全川淸剿土匪的「戰績」，計年內格斃及俘獲大小能首九三名，從匪一·五四〇名，奪獲槍支計包括機槍步槍四一〇支，救出被擄人一六八名，目前在鄧主席指示下正舉行全川總圍剿，肯定最近全川匪患可漸次肅淸。</p>
<p>四川人民在抗戰中顚沛困苦八年之後，目前最迫切需要的是安定興休息，這是參議員一致的意見，然而目前安定社會的最大阻力，即是使社會極度動盪，民生極度不寗的土匪橫行，也是四川目前的最大禍患，「肅淸匪患，安定社會」，「萬事莫如保安急」，這是全川五千萬人民的一致呼聲。</p>
<p>烟毒流患　遍及全川</p>
<p>與盜匪並行流毒於四川社會另一弊患是烟毒，本來賓政計劃早定今明兩年爲川省烟毒總禁絕年，同時本年禁政推行，亦會不遺力，但是禁者自禁，犯者自犯，參議員一致感喟到法律對於禁政是太優容了。禁烟督理處長在參議會中報告今年的禁政成績，指出今年禁種方面已在川西南之松理懋汶一帶及川北之平武靑川一帶去烟苗三萬一千餘畝，查獲烟犯萬餘名，但是烟毒仍在四處潛伏蔓延。</p>
<p>參議員來自各縣，報告各鄉各鎭的流毒情形，尤其對於特殊惡勢力的包庇縱容，切齒痛恨，川北的參議員指出旺蒼一地，强力所種烟之多，可冠全國。川東的參議員指出由入川輪隻走私所帶的嗎啡，與原來流行的鴉片充斥大小角落，使川東一帶今日幾成一片毒化世界，問政府對於澈底禁絕決心之外，對於惡勢力的包庇，有無有效制止辦法？</p>
<p>四川社會目前在混亂中已經支離破碎廉難不堪，何能再受毒化？參議員代表四川人民，發出懇切痛苦的呼籲。</p>
<p>綜合參議員代表全川人民發出的呼聲，認爲以四川今天的情形，應該「萬事莫如安定急」。讓人民安居樂業，對於當局高唱的建設計劃，雖然高瞻遠矚，氣魄雄偉，似乎應該急其所急，首先對於當前四川三大患——貪汚，匪患，烟毒——作澈底的澄淸與滅絕，使四川於社會安定之後，再求進步，漸圖發展，否則三患的寒流滋長，將使四川人民的春天姗姗來遲，這是四川人民代表的呼聲，也是全川五千萬人民一致的迫切要求。</p>

<h3>台灣水電事業之前途</h3>
<p>— 茅榮林</p>
<p>台灣島為我國東南部二大海島之一，位於東經一百二十度至一百二十一度北緯二十二度至二十五度半之間，與福建省關海相望，相距不及百浬，面積爲三萬五千八百四十七平方公里，海岸綫長九千四百四十公里，人口有漢族四百七十三萬四千人。番族（包括生番熱番）十四萬八千人。原為我國領土，唐宋之時，漢人即徙居其地，明末鄭成功據台灣以抗淸廷之時，東南人士，入居尤多。清代統一以後，初改台灣府，廳福建省，後又改為台灣省，延至今日，閩粵人仍佔台灣人口百分之九十以上，自一八九五年中日戰爭中國失敗後，割台灣與日本，經日人五十年來之經營，生產額於一九三七年價値已達三億一千萬日元，較一九二八年一億四千七百萬日元，相偏十年竟增加一倍有餘，較在我國版圖時之收人僅百萬元，則更增加數百十倍矣。七七以還，日本南進政策逐步完成，爲配合其軍事需求，更積極開發合灣之資源，八年來使台灣水電車業，工礦建設，均有建樹，且頗具規模，不但昔日之台灣望塵莫及，且一躍而居今日東南海洋中國防經濟區域內之重要地位。去年九月，日本無條件投降，台灣在我國勝利之下，重回祖國懷抱，從今以後，其使命除爲我國東南沿海諸省之屏障，南北海空軍之樞鈕外，更爲奠定太平洋永久和平之基地。豈容吾人再加忽視</p>
<p>台灣在日本統治時期，其經濟政策原全屬殖民地性質，僅鼓勵台人努力米·糖·茶·水菓等之大量生產·以供給日本本土之需求，而將其本土之過剩工業品，如肥料·紡織物，及其他製成品等輸入台灣，以榨取火量之利潤；七七以後，因台灣成爲海空軍基地，乃積極發展軍事工業，於是其經濟政策，亦隨之而變爲戰略性質者，如煉鋁·煉油·電石·鋼鐵·合金·橡皮·酒精·造船等工廠，無不决第建立，竭力擴充，一如雨後春笋，至爲蓬勃。至於煤，金，鋼等礦之生產，在戰前已具基礎，而戰時又更加擴展，凡此種種有關軍事工業之突飛猛晉，均有賴於動力資源之開發與供應，故日本對於台灣水力資源之調查及開發，不遺餘力。據台灣電力株式會社之報告，台灣水力資源，最高可開發三百餘萬瓩，其中可以經濟利用者，至少亦在二百萬瓩以上。日政府曾有十年開發一百萬瓩之計劃，並已於民國二十一年開始進行，該計劃中心當推大甲溪工程規模最大，共設電廠八處，發電量達四十五萬瓩，且有三處已在興工。此外並組織台灣電力株式會社，統一經營台　電力事業，以達政府統制之目的。該社資本的三億日元，係官商合股，台灣總督府出資八分之一，餘均爲商股，但經營之權，則完全操於日政府，社長副社長及理事，概由總督指派，而經營方針，亦由日政府規定。其設備計全台已成之發電廠凡三十四處，裝置發電量共約三十二萬瓩，內包括水力發電廠大小共二十六處，發電量共約二十七萬瓩，中以日月潭第一廠為最大，計發電量為十萬瓩，於民國二十三年完成。火力發電廠八處，共約五萬瓩，中以北部大力發電廠為最大，以備枯水時期輔助及臨時應急之用。</p>
<p>民國三十年以後，日政府更積極開發台灣之水力賽源，其已興工者凡九處，裝置發電量共約二七萬瓩，其中工程大部告竣者有三處，共發電量十一萬瓩。迨至戰爭末期，美空軍自民國三十三年十月起，迭次聶炸台灣日月潭第一第二兩電廠，均有損失，且於民國三十四年四月被炸最烈，所有附屬之變電所，完全破壞，輸水管亦略波及，幸發電廠本身受損尚微，機器亦全部無恙。東部溪口發電廠，亦遭炸毀，此外各地之二次變電所，及輪電配電等設備，均被炸壞，雖經修理後，仍可維持發電，但容量已减少甚多。又於民國三十三年及三十四年夏秋之交，全台遭颱風襲擊，繼又普遍山崩，西部　山，天送碑，萬大，各發電廠，均受換害，他如東部大小水力發電廠八處，亦均受猛烈之打擊，河床因砂石塡塞竟有高達十六公尺之多，且幾全部被毀，我邐勝利接收時，台灣供電能力，竟降低至四萬二千瓩，幾不及餓時發電量十分之一。此實爲主要原因。</p>
<p>台灣在光復之後，我政府即着手接收，先組織台灣電力監理委員會，以劉晋鈺爲主任委員，黃煇爲副主任委員，於民國三十四年十一月九日，開始監理，其重要措施如下：（一）嚴督員工，星夜趕修已被破壞之工程，並將負荷較輕之變壓器移裝於日月潭，暫時應付全省目前各工廠電力之供應，同時滅少火力發電量，籍以節省台地煤斤之消耗。（二）改善各縣市配電設備，使供電能得到安全之保障。（三）編製修復及擴充水電訐劃，關於修復方面分爲二期：第一期自四萬二千瓩增至十萬瓩，定期三個月內完成，第二期自十萬瓩增至二十萬瓩，定期一年內完成。關於擴充方面亦分爲二期；第一期擴充十萬瓩，完成發可得總發電量三十萬瓩，定期三年內完成；第二期擴充二十萬瓩，完成後可得總發電量五十萬瓩，定期五年內完成。目前第一期修復計劃，已如期完成，第二期亦已完成一部份，發電總量已達十八萬餘瓩，超過目前各工廠之需求，將來全部修復後，足可供應戰前一切工廠之電力，至於擴充計劃，正在設計繪圖等準備工作中。（四）遴選台籍優秀員工，設立國語補習班，作各項專業訓練，籍以培養幹部，並收就地取才之功。（五）因大甲溪各處工程停頓，及東部各電廠停工，原有員工，頗多閒散，經加整頓後，裁汰八百餘人，並解雇日籍員工一千一百餘人，以節省開支，增加工作效率。（六）控制財務，嚴格執行預決算，淸查帳目，確定股權，俾財務行政，漸入正軌。</p>
<p>三十五年三月二十日又奉令改稱台灣電力接管委員會，作進一步之接收工作，在此時期中接管委員會即作下列諸措施：（一）羅致國內及台省人才，分任重要職務，使技術及業務方面，得以繼續發展，不致中輟。（二）愼重留用日籍技術員工，勉以服務道德，予以平等待遇，使其安心工作。（三）各廠所分散各地，治安不靖，竊案時生，委託警務處代爲訓練警員，成立警衛隊，分派各地，維持保護。（四）烏來水電廠土木部份未完工程，計劃繼續興工。（五）台省電氣器材，光復後多被藏匿或愉運出口，補充困難，影響電力事業至鉅，乃呈請長官公署會同有關各方，嚴禁五金器材及電氣材料出口，籍資補救。</p>
<p>卅五年四月，接管委員會成立，資源委員會錢主任委員昌照　台，經與合省陳行政長官儀，商妥經營原則，乃組織董事會，以資源委員會電業處陳處長中熙爲董事長，並派劉董事晋鈺代理總經理，黃董事煇，柳董事德玉代理協理，於三十五年五月一日再奉令先行成立台灣電力股份有限公司（簡稱台灣電力公司）在總經理協理之下，分設機電，土木，企劃，總務，業務，經理，會計等七處，並將原設全台各地之十二處支店，改組為區辦事處，至於發電廠，變電所，修理廠，及電氣計器試騐所高壓試騐所等均仍舊設立，各處處長及所屬各單位主管人員，亦經絡續派定，人事已漸臻健全。</p>
<p>工程方面，以積極修復戰時被破壞之設備爲中心目標，故首先從事於日月潭水電廠之修復，以期於本年年底達到二十萬瓩發電量之規定。另由多方面接洽向外國採購獎壓器及開關設備，以加强輸電力量。至於擴充方面，則先設立烏來水電廠工程處，繼續施工，營造其未完部份之工程。</p>
<p>業務方面，以修復費用浩大，加以物價上漲，爲求收支平衡及維持供電業務計，不得不將電價略加調整，並同時督促各區辦事處，對於收費，抄表，管理，承裝商店各節，力加整頓，使用戶便利，收人增進，均可平行不悖。</p>
<p>過去仰給於日本輸入之物資，今後必須由台省自給，然後才能自足，此爲發展今後台省經濟之鵠的。故凡化學肥料，煉油，煉鋼，造船，製糖，製紙，製鹹，水泥，電石，以及煤金銅等各項農工礦產之經營開發，無不需要大量電力之供應，例如硫安肥料用水電解每噸需用電三千六百度（一度等於一瓩時），電石每噸需用電三千五百度，苛性曹達每噸需用電三千四百度，又如製糖，過去最高產量年達一百四十萬噸，需用七萬四千六百瓩（合十萬匹馬力）之電力。此外農村電氣化之灌溉工程，城市電車及鐵路電氣化等，皆需大量電力，經專家初步估計認爲在三年內全台發電量至少須達三十萬瓩，五年內至少須達五十萬瓩，方足以供應台省工業化之需求〔見附台灣省五年建設計劃中電力需要佔計表）因此合灣省將來水電事業之推進，必本此原則逐步擴充，冀能如期達到上述之數字，茲探得關於將來擴充之計劃摘要如下：</p>
<p>（一）完成烏來，天冷，霧社，三水力發電工程：</p>
<p>（一）烏來水力發電廠工程——該工程土木部份已完成百分之九十五，發電設備已運到一萬二千五百瓩水輪發電機一套，預計半年內可以裝竣供電。</p>
<p>（二）天冷水力發電廠工程——該工程爲大甲溪計劃之一，土木部份現已完成百分之七十，擬於三十六年年底將全部土木工程完成，並向美國訂購二萬六千瓩水輪發電機二套，安裝供電。</p>
<p>（三）霧社水力發電廠工程——該工程之廠房及發電設備，已全部完成，輸水道亦完成百分之七十，惟蓄水壩僅完成百分之五，擬繼續興工建造完成，以備發電供應。</p>
<p>（二）添建南勢，竹東，豐原，明治四水力發電廠：</p>
<p>（一）南勢水力發電廠工程——該工程位於台北縣南勢溪上游，落差一三〇公尺，計劃竣電量為二萬瓩，該處運輸路已大部完成，擬於三年內完成全部工程並發電供應。</p>
<p>（二）竹東水力發電廠工程——該工程位於新竹縣頭前溪，落差二二四公尺，計劃發電量為二萬一千瓩，初步設計已完成，擬於四年內建築完成幷發電供應。</p>
<p>（三）豐原第一水力發電廠工程——該工程為大甲溪計劃之一，落差一〇五公尺，計劃發電量為五萬一千二百瓩，其隊洞之橫坑已開鑿一部份，擬於四年內全部完成幷發電供應。</p>
<p>（四）明治水力發電廠工程——該工程亦爲大甲溪計劃之一，落差一七四公尺，計劃發電量爲七萬一瓩，其各項準備工程已完成一部份，隧洞模坑亦已動工，擬於五年內全部完成幷發電供應。</p>
<p>（三）擴充北部火力發電廠</p>
<p>台灣水力發電，以地形及兩量關係，頗需火力發電之都充與調節，根據過去之經騐，每年平均有四個月之時期，各大小火力發電廠，均須升火供電。茲擬先在北部火力發電廠內，增加三萬五千瓩之汽輸發電機一座，使全台枯水節季之用電，不致中斷。此次工程估計全部需費時二年半</p>
<p>上述計劃，按三十五年一月份之物價估計，修復部份需要美金四百萬元台幣八千六百四十萬元；擴充部份需要美金一千萬元台幣二十億元，深望政府與人民，均能踴躍投資，共襲盛舉</p>
<p>台灣地位旣跨溫熱兩帶，氣候溫和，物產豐富，除年產米八百萬担外，更有大量蔗糖，樟腦，茶葉，及煤銅鋁等礦產，且允多水力資源，足供今後全島工業電氣化之需要，戰前日本統治時，已逐漸開發四五十萬瓩後經戰爭摧毀及颱風破壞，於我國接收時，只存四萬二千瓩，現在經一年來之努力修理，已達十八萬餘瓩，幷於明年二月可達二十萬瓩，三年後可達三十萬瓩，五年後可達五十萬瓩，再繼以始終不懈之精神，不難於二三十年後將全部三百二十餘萬瓩之水力，完成開發。其剩餘電力，更可越台灣海峽輸入福建，以補該省水力資源之不足。　者至此如再檢視附表八個，定能洞悉無遺矣。</p>

<h3>獲得生產貸款後</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>生產貸款對於目前一般工商界解救當前的難關，可以說是一個極大的助力，因爲一般廠商，受着高利貸的壓迫，負債數字，日漲夜大，實在有不能應付，也是無法應付之苦。雖則生產貸款審核會所核准的數目，朱必與原來申請的數目相符，然而在解救困難方面，當然不無補助。</p>
<p>然而生產貸款貸到以後，僅能協助資金的週轉，等於加多了一筆流動資金。今後一切，還有待於自身的努力。所謂自身的努力，據筆者的意見，以為最重大的是一個組職的問題。生產貸款的定期是六個月，所以在今後的六個月中，除非有精密的計劃，到了限期屆滿的時候，還是要弄得一團糟而無法解決的。</p>
<p>要談到計劃，就是一個組織的問題，也就是人事的問題。一般申請貸款的廠商，應請趕快健全自身的組織，使生產，銷售，以及經濟週度三個部門，得到協調，在規定的計劃下進行，那末願為繁榮，是不難達到目的的。</p>
<p>即使最小的事情，也應該以整頓改良。例如一般廠商的主管人員不能集中工作，每天工作的時間很少，或者是把一切事權集中在一個人身上，結果不能應付裕如，反而誤事。這雖則是一個小問題，可是錯誤往往由小錯誤而造成，大困難正是許多小困難的集合。</p>
<h3>汽車運輸業在美國</h3>
<p>— 陳湘</p>
<p>假如說鐵路是美國運輸的脊椎，航空綫是他的神經末稍，那末，保持美國國家的血液循環的就是汽車運輸企業了。</p>
<p>運貨汽車與米老鼠同樣的在美國人的生活中佔着重要的地位。雖然全部運貨汽車的運輸量僅佔全美的運輸十量的百分之四點六，但是這個百分比却有他的重要性。必須迅速的輸送到市塲上去的食物，由工廠直接迭到消費者的家中的生產品，家畜和織物，商店送貨和垃圾，油類與流動圖書館——這些和上千種其他的東西都是用運貨汽車搬運的。五分之二的美國的社團都僅由運貨汽車來服役的。</p>
<p>運貨汽車的最大的優點當然要推便利和迅速。沒有一種近代的運貨器具能够像運貨汽車一樣的直接開入倉庫裏去，載上貨物再送到市區的商店去。運輸少量的貨物，從時間而言，火車也不是汽車的敵手——例如，從紐約到里士曼運貨汽車祗要走兩天，但是火車一轉折却要十天。</p>
<p>一部汽車：可成運輸單位</p>
<p>加以近十九年來，美國政府努力舖築公路，所以汽車運輸已成了美國大事業之一。。二十年前，美國僅有述貨汽車三十二萬六千輛，今天却是超過四百五十萬輛了。這種事業也可說是個人化的，因爲半數以上的運貨汽車是屬於僅有一輛而無更多的人。可是，另一方面，有許多運輸公司都置有幾百輛；「美國電話及電報公司」擁有二萬二千輛之鉅。雖然這四百多萬輛運貨汽車中僅有百分之十五是出租的，但是車主們每年的總利潤竟達二十億元美金。</p>
<p>美國的公路雖然四通八達，但各州管制運貨汽車的規則都不相同，使司機和車主大爲頭痛，尤其是相異的載重量的限制，對汽車運輸的效率有很大的影響。</p>
<p>載重量：一至二十二噸</p>
<p>遠貨汽車大都堅固耐用，現在在美國公路上奔馳的運貨汽車有一半是一九三七年以前造的，有些已有行駛一百萬哩以上的紀錄。汽車的式樣眞是洋洋大觀；汽車的結構也愈趨精緻，最完善的裝有冷汽，水汀和空氣調整器。載重量也變化多端，在一九二四年，四分之三的美國的運貨汽車都是一噸的或是更輕些的，但是，今天，由於各種的需要的不同，汽車運輸公司能够撥一輛載重量半噸的小車子替你裝遝包裹，也能够派出一輛二十二噸半的大車子爲礦塲和鋸木塲工作。十九家汽車製造公司，造出各式各樣的車子任籲客挑選。</p>
<p>至於美國的運貨汽車的司機，並不自觀爲操　業的人。他們的職務是安全而準時的運送貨物，他們忠實的盡着這種責任。並且他們一般的是優秀約有體貌的駕駛者，據最近的統計，所有的運貨車每一萬哩始有二點四件肇禍的事件——遠低於私人汽車肇禍的紀錄。</p>
<p>四海為家：司機是流浪者</p>
<p>司機的待遇並不優厚。行駛遠路的司機，每哩的工資大的兩分到四分美金；當地的司機則按時或按日計酬。在紐約，司機的薪金一般的都較他處爲高，每星期工作四十四小時，所得也不過四十六元到六十四元美金。幸運些的司機可以得到食物與寄宿的津貼。</p>
<p>司機與其他的運輸從業員有同樣的苦悶，就是車輪多轉一轉，離家愈遠一點，而他們大部份都是成了家的人。也就因爲這一點，他們同業問的感情特別密切。有經騐的司機，都知道那裏的咖啡煮得最好，何家飯店烹調可口，那家旅館招待週到，在這些地方的門口，常川不息的停着許多運貨軍，成了司機的集會所，俱樂部和交誼室。</p>
<p>汽車運輸對於美國的都市的日活生活更爲重要，三十四個最大的都市都是用汽車輸送牛乳，供給支加哥的家禽的百分之八十九，供給洛杉磯的水果與蔬菜的百分之八十都是汽車輸送的。沒有這種有規律的服務，美國的都市的居民祇好挨餓。</p>
<p>美國的汽車運輸業目前所佔的運輸量雖微小，但是業中人的企望却極大，他們希望能多承攬些生意，增加速率，减低運費。假如所有這些計劃都眞的實現了，運貨汽車在貨運方面將成爲火車的勁敵。</p>
<h3>談營口港之改良</h3>
<p>— 黃議洪</p>
<p>營口一港由咸豐八年（——一八五八）中英條約開爲商埠。十九世紀下半期爲東北第一大商埠。以後逐次衰落降爲東北四大商埠之一。四大商埠即大連，濱江，安東與營口。及至九一八事變時已降爲七大商埠之一，七大商埠即上述四埠再加瀋陽，長春，與葫蘆島。在十九世紀末遼河口港灣內泊有民船二萬餘隻，民國初年有三千隻，到九一八時已只有一千五百隻，即此可見其衰落情形之一斑。</p>
<p>關於營口所以衰落之原因可以分三點。</p>
<p>第一是因爲遼河河口淤淺。</p>
<p>第二是大連之勃興。</p>
<p>第三是北寗南滿安瀋三條鐵路幹綫的完成。雖然營口港面臨如此重大的危機，但是他仍舊有着振興的希望，這裹我們懷着三個希望；</p>
<p>（一）開關松遼運河。遼河的流域僅包括南滿的一隅，如果松遼運河完成，則航行可擴展至松花江流城，且可深人北滿腹地，足可吸收大量物資。</p>
<p>（二）疏濬太子河及渾河。兩河均爲遼河之支流，占有全國煤油煤炭總產量三分之一以上的撫順礦區渾河畔，鞍山鐵礦，及廟安溝弓長嶺礦區（擁有亞洲第一之鍊鋼廠）在太子河畔。煤鐵笨重，運輸以航運爲便利而經濟，此兩河能疏濬完成，營口便能成爲東亞第一煤鐵輸出港。</p>
<p>（三）改良河口。水道疏深到二十五呎，使得沿海大輪得以出入無阻。又因河道下游灣曲太多，泥沙沉積更易，故必須截灣取直，得以永久保持深水綫。</p>
<p>以上計劃完成以後營口足可踰越大連安東而上之。加另</p>
<p>勞工的健康直接有關生產建設。美國政府與產業界人士均洞悉此中利害，故倡導硏究積極地保障勞工健康，不遺餘力。我們祗要看他們對工友眼睛目力的保護一點，就可以明白。</p>
<p>紐約州的「社會福利部」訂有條例，特設一「盲眼局」。凡發生眼盲不幸事件，均須將姓名·年齡·地址·眼盲原因·經過等呈報該局。該局責在稞障人民的眼球健康，防止瞽曹，協助並督責工業界推行眼睛安全運動。</p>
<p>另有社會機構「全國瞽盲預防會」（National　Society　forthe　Prevention　of　Blindness　）在各州設有分會，努力於預防瞽盲，减少殘廢;經常協助各工廠檢查工友目力；採用安全眼罩（從事危險工作的）；配置適宜的光綫；調節工塲與機器所塗的顏色；勸告戴帶眼鏡（該會統計的百分之四十的工友們應該配眼鏡）；並設法使目力較差的人，從事於少用目力的工作，以免過度戕傷，而致失明。工廠方面也大都樂於改進並接受該會勸告云。（譯自Industrial　MedlcineJune,1946）</p>

<p>在戰時，耐綸絲是專給軍部使用於製造降落拿的，所以，自從一九四〇年第一雙玻璃絲　在市場上出現之後，一直是求過於供。今日，耐綸百分之九十的用途是製造女子的絲　，美國杜邦公司在計劃每年生產二三·〇〇〇·〇〇〇磅酣綸絲，即絲　四五〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇雙。</p>
<p>這　　有光的合成纖維，卻是從煤空氣和水中紡出來的，關於耐綸絲製成的經過，略作介紹於下：</p>
<p>耐綸的原料是煤水和空氣。煤中取其炭，水中取　，空氣中取　　，這四種元素構成耐綸的粗胚，呌做耐綸鹽溶酸。</p>
<p>把耐綸鹽溶液放在巨大的器皿中蒸發，使其中的水份完全蒸發，然後使耐綸進入另一桶中，在高溫下，耐綸之小分子壘合（Polymerize）而成鏈形的長分子。</p>
<p>這壘合而得的東西在熔融狀態下從扁孔中流出，像牙膏一般，稱的壘合帶（Polymer　ritbou）　　在滾筒上，滾筒的一邊浸入冷水中，滾筒旋轉着，耐綸就冷下變硬，走至刀臺切在薄片。如是而得的薄片須再入混　機中和嗢的滾筒得來的混和，以使出品質性均勻化。</p>
<p>經過混和後，就再加熱使之熔化，使這熔漿在金屬板的小孔中擠出，製成耐綸纖維，這纖維在冷空氣中很快就凝固了，然後在紡機上紡成耐綸絲。</p>
<p>從紡機的紗筒上取下的耐綸絲樣品，取其一定長度，放在天平上的稱，分別耐綸絲粗細。在紗筒上分別其厚度。把紗筒放入箱，中放在耐綸絲紐絞整理爐中乾焙。然後再繞在綫軸上。</p>
<p>把耐綸絲從一個綫軸紡至另一個，經過一　機器，在絲的表面上一層膠質，在織絲　或其他織物時以致保護。每個紗筒或綫軸的耐綸絲，尚然仔細檢騐，務使完整無瑕後，須後裝箱運至針織廠。</p>

<h3>學到老做到老　青春永不逝</h3>
<p>— 春之譯自本月號讀者文摘</p>
<p>幾乎在任何那一年的年紀中，「老」的恐懼，會隨時襲擊你。以一個診病的專門硏究老年人種種問題的心理學者的資格來說，我發覺在我的病人們中百分比，比較多的是三十歲的壯年——那些壯年男女們一面對於年齡的增長已經在憂愁着了，一面正想學習如何去應付那些增長了的年齡。我正要說七的話，對於從十歲起，七十歲爲止的中間任何人，假使他對於保持自己的靑春感到有興趣的話，讀了都會有益處的。</p>
<p>但是，在我把我的藥方說出來之前，我想最好是把人生的年齡，來解釋一遍。年齡是不應該根據你生日的數目來計算的。第一，生理上的時間和鐘錶上的時間是完全不一樣的。年齡增高了，生理的時間慢下來了；你越老，你的年紀增加得越慢。生理上來講，你在三十歲到四十歲之間的改變，不會比你在二十五歲到三十歲之間的改變較爲多的；從五十五歲到七十五歲，也不會比從四十歲到五十五歲改變得更多</p>
<p>另外的一個理由，指出爲什麼用日曆來計算年齡是錯誤的，是因爲你身體中各種不同的部份是用着各種不同的速率老起來的。你的眼睛在十歲時開始的；你的聽覺在近二十歲時開始的。在三十歲時，你筋肉的氣力，反應的作用，和生殖的精力，都已經恰巧過了牠們的最高峯。　腦子老得最慢　另外的一面說，你的頭腦還仍舊年青着呢，在五十歲時，還仍舊在生長着；你的腦子在這年紀以後的十年，才達到了全盛的頂點。從六十歲開始，精神上的能力非常緩慢地衰老了，一直到八十歲的高齡。</p>
<p>在八十歲，你能够在精神上保持着三十歲時一樣的富强——並且你應該比在三十歲時知道得多呢。老年人常常對於自己記憶力的損失而感覺到痛苦，但是創造性的想像是沒有年紀地永遠存在着的。再有什麼呢，用年齡，使我們的自省力和觀察力更形發展。我們的判斷力和理解性也因之在進步着；所以，感謝豐富的經騐，使我們有妙計去解決一切人生上的難題。總而言之，由於年齡的增加使我們獲得了智慧。這也就是，爲什麽老年的醫生，老練的律師，經騐豐富的技術師都還能够常常使自己去和那些較年輕，較强壯的對手們匹敵地一決勝負的緣故。</p>
<p>每天學一件事</p>
<p>我的保持靑春的藥方是很簡單的：把所有的注意力完全集中在你仍舊很年輕，依舊在生長着的部份－－你的腦子。使你的頭腦永遠的淸醒着，這樣，你就完全生活在靑春之中了。目前是一個興奮振作的時代，你該對你四周圍的世界感到興趣，最低限度每天學習一件新的事。（譯者按：所謂「苟日新，日日新」是也。）</p>
<p>最要緊的是千萬不要『坐下來享淸福」。心理學家們司空見慣的是，在三十而立之年，人們有着兩種相反的個性的發展。有些男人和女人們雖然一面做着職業，和照顧着家庭，一面還在繼績不斷的開發着其他的新興趣。他們硏讀着報紙和雜誌。他們做着有創造性的嗜好，喜歡運用着他們的雙手和大腦。</p>
<p>無論你現在是幾歲了，還來得及使你的生活改變得更有趣一些，時間尚還不晚呢，我知這一個主婦，他在五十歲時，以前是沒有絲毫經騰的，竟開始使自己變成了一個超特的工業圖案設計家。我知道一個告老了的電機工程師，他竟變成了一個薪俸極高的瓷器畫家。我的一個病人——一個七十歲的老太婆，她的兒孫們以爲她老朽無能得該休養了－－創設了一所專門敎導新娘們的烹調學校，並且很成功。</p>
<p>老了還要學習</p>
<p>千萬別以為你自己已經太老了，不能再到學校中去了，快把這意見完全打消！我知道一個男人，他在七十歲時進了醫學院，他獲得了銜頭和榮譽，變成了一個赫赫有名的醫生。另外的一個人在七十一歲時進了法律學校，現在是一個頗出風頭的名律師。美國歷史上現在保持着一項紀錄尚還沒有被打破過，就是一個九十一歲的加利福尼亞地方的女人，走進了大學去讀一年級。我知道一個女人，她在七十七歲時去學習繪畫，在八十歲時開了一次個人展覽會，今天八十六歲了，還在努力着。</p>
<p>不管你多少年紀，欲保持青春，對於前途無量的人，是非常容易的。假使你高興嘗試的話，你一定能够做得到。使你的頭腦永遠淸醒着，永遠的活躍着；這就是保險有效的長生不老術。</p>
<h3>說話銀行家</h3>
<p>— 鄧樹勛</p>
<p>世間態，人間味</p>
<p>有人問一位深刻的文學家，「銀行的定義如何」？那位著名的文學家回答說：「晴天他借雨傘給你，等到下雨天，他就把雨傘收回。」</p>
<p>錦上添花乃是銀行家的本分，雪上加霜更是銀行家的絕技。</p>
<p>有一位靑年進錢莊習業，掌櫃的對他訓話：「你要做錢業，第一件要訣就是絕六親，不論諸親好友，借錢要照規矩，就是令尊，也不能例外。」他敎他對有錢的快叩頭，對困苦的加白眼。</p>
<p>要找尋世間態人間味，最好往銀行去轉一轉，他們有武裝實彈的警衛，有鐵隔高大的櫃台，更有窗洞內銀行員眼珠子裏散出來的一股冷氣，他當上門的不是好人，你拿滿懷熱意去換取他的一團陰氣。</p>
<p>押品，押品，押品！</p>
<p>有很多人盼望銀行家做慈善家，這個念頭壓根兒轉錯了。你想他們的條件多兇狠：「押品」，「押品」，「押品」，他們的字典裏是沒有「善意」的。第一個字是可靠而不變的押品，第二個字是隨時能變賣的押品，第三個字是永遠不會發生糾紛的押品，他要把債主押起來，放在手掌中，使你逃不了，賴不掉，終於虧不了。市商會要請求銀行家放寬尺度，簡化手續，變通押品，料不到做了這麽多年生意經，連得銀行家的脾胃都不知道，無怪乎要碰橡皮釘子了。須知他們的腦筋裏，由先師傳授，連爸爸都沒有地位的，還睬你們這般什麼公會做啥子。</p>
<p>有一位未得老師傳授而妄想做銀行家的野心家，有一天，頭寸擺不平了，他打常話給一家銀行要求把昨日的拆放款項展緩一天，他也不懂得銀行家的脾胃，照例應該說天晴的，他反而說作天雨了，他不說；「我頭寸很鬆，展期不展期無所謂，如閣下頭寸多，我可分挑一點，押品也有，儘請吩咐。」反而說：「我不得了，擺不平，倒下來你也沒有好處。」這是呌救命的聲音，並且在告訴他你如不小心也要掉下水去了，把人家嚇得大跳，非收回昨天的款子不可；因爲知道天將下雨，非復晴天可比，雨傘例該收回。被收回了雨傘的野心家，終於淋了雨，倒下來了。</p>
<p>更有一家銀行，業務人員太重情面，原有押品被客戶騙走了，放款收不回，這是吃了未絕六新的虧，認為未够練達，尚待訓練。</p>
<h3>你要借雨傘嗎？</h3>
<p>緣木求魚的故事，大概是爲了目前的銀行家寫的。人家說某先生的算盤多末精明，某先生的手面多末煞辣，你不要錯怪了他們，他們原來都是銀行家呀，你有雨傘的，就是下了雨他還想借給你，你旣沒有雨衣，又沒有雨傘的，他就要看太陽出來了未，否則是借不到雨傘的。世上笨人儘多，可是再也沒有比在下雨天去問銀行家借雨傘的那種笨人再笨的了。</p>
<p>爲了提醒聰明的人更聰明些，切勿變做聰明的笨人，乃寫出銀行家的脾胃給讀者體味體味。</p>

<h3>過時的寓言；　邱吉爾和鯉魚</h3>
<p>— 宗梁</p>
<p>法國淪陷之後，在那個被敵人統治下的區域中，人們在輕聲低語中，流傳着一個非常著名的寓言：</p>
<p>故事是叙述一九四〇年七月，英國在單獨地和敵人應戰的時候，希特勒請邱吉爾到巴黎來秘密會議。邱吉爾乘飛機到來時，就被迎接到芬登白流的別墅中，那裏，希特勒和墨索里尼在那有名的鯉魚池旁，一隻茶桌上等待着。</p>
<p>德國元首是不肯浪費時間：『邱吉爾，這是我要對你說的話，英國是完結了。在這張文書上簽個字，承認英國已戰敗了，於是全歐洲，在明天，就可以有和平了！』</p>
<p>『抱歉我不能簽字，』邱吉爾平靜地回答：『我不承認我們已戰敗了。』</p>
<p>『豈有此理！』希特勒拍着桌子大聲的說：『事實證明呀！』</p>
<p>邱吉爾喝了」口茶，『在英國，』他說，『我們常常用打賭的方法來解決意見不同的，你們肯和我來賭一下嗎？輸的人該承認是戰爭中的失敗者。』</p>
<p>『怎樣賭法？』德國元首疑惑地問。</p>
<p>『你們看見池中的那些大鯉魚嗎？好，讓我們來打賭，不用任何普通釣魚的器具，誰先捉到一條鯉魚，就是戰爭中的勝利者。』</p>
<p>『就賭好了！』希特勒咆哮着說。他拉出一根手槍向着近邊的鯉魚濫開槍。但是，池水使槍彈徧斜了，鯉魚依舊不受損害地游泳着。</p>
<p>『你來吧，墨索！』希特勒咆哮着說。『人家告訴我你是一個游泳的高手——跳進去！』</p>
<p>那意國總裁脫去了他的衣服，跳進池中去，但是他雖然努力地嘗試着，鯉魚郤總是在他的掌握中滑了出去。最後，他精疲力盡了，兩手空空的爬上了岸。</p>
<p>『邱吉爾，你來了。』希特勒神經刺激地說：『讓我們看看你能够做些什麽！』</p>
<p>邱吉爾平靜地把他的茶匙浸在水中，提起一匙水，丟過他的肩頭。這樣的一次又一决的把水從池中提出來。希特勒張開着嘴驚異地看着說：『你在這裏究竟做些什麽事呀？』他不耐煩地要求着說。</p>
<p>『雖然那需要一個長久的時候，但是池水總會枯涸的。」邱吉爾一面繼續的提水出來，一面同答着說，「勝利必屬於我！』大小事　天下大小事，節錄於此。</p>
<h3>垃圾與蔬菜</h3>
<p>— 方文</p>
<p>因爲垃圾車帶運蔬菜黃魚，引起市參議會一片責難，鬧得滿城風雨。平心而論，當此生活艱困，營私勢所難免，利用垃圾車來，做些副業，貼補車夫生計，自不能和一般官塲，上下勾通，營私舞弊，等量齊觀，亦較諸利用公家汽車，送太太上麻將局，送公子小姐上舞塲電影院，較勝一籌；不過因爲專心致志於生財之道，致使市區垃圾，堆積如山，因私誤公，似不能卸其責任，而且市衛生局職掌全市衛生，用垃圾車來裝運蔬菜黃魚好像總有些「那個」！</p>
<h3>黃金，糞土，捏造。</h3>
<p>— 方</p>
<p>復興島藏金疑案，由金條化爲糞土，由糞土變爲揑造，撲朔迷離，引人入勝，幸虧檢察官三次下江南，得了綫索，案情不久就將大白，案中主角，不久也就要失去其神密人物的資格了。</p>
<h3>「茶杯裏的波浪」</h3>
<p>— 方</p>
<p>踢斃小販王永祥的港警，前經高院宣判無罪矣，港府允給家屬恤金港幣萬元，總算中國人命，在港島上有了法定的價格，可是這筆賣命錢，臨時又因領款手續，發生爭執，港府又「牽絲攀藤」，還要重加考慮，不能痛痛快快付與死者家屬之手。這些，在「他們」看來，當然又是「茶杯裏的波浪！」</p>
<p>（按：某英人前喩香港問題爲「茶杯裏的波浪。」</p>
<h3>杜魯門的困難</h3>
<p>— 家源</p>
<p>美國新國會已正式成立。新歲以來，杜魯門曾接一連二向新國會發表本年度施政演說，提出經濟報告和新預算案。由於一九四六年國會選舉中共和黨獲勝實際上美國會的參衆兩院已置於共和黨控制之下，而總統却是一個民主黨的總統。雖然美國民共兩黨政策，最近已趨接近，但不同的地方還是很多，尤以內政爲然。美國的國會彷彿是家長，總統彷彿是家庭中的總幹事，家長和總幹事間意見往往不能一致，辦事不免棘手，以前的成爾遜，胡佛都曾碰到過這種困難。杜魯門也將遇到同樣困難了。</p>
<h3>安理會的爭執</h3>
<p>— 南</p>
<p>安理會最近爲了原子管制問題和普遍裁軍問題鬧得很兇，會塲中美蘇代表展開激烈舌戰。美國堅主優先討論原子管制問題，一定要遵照美國所提建議，使否決權不適用於此一範圍，並設立監督機構，切實管制各國原子能材料的處理，否則不願意參加裁軍討論。蘇聯則用普遍裁軍的擋箭牌來攔擋。但事實上，假如華盛頓和莫斯科決心要解決這問題，那麼兩國的負責人員應該把握問題的癥結，談個一明二白，不然，又何必多此一舉？</p>
<h3>蒙帥到蘇聯</h3>
<p>— 南</p>
<p>英參謀長蒙哥馬利元帥訪問蘇聯，也是上過中的一大新聞。猶憶　帥訪問美國討論英美軍備標準化，訪問加拿大討論北極地帶防票工作的時候，蘇聯曾大感不安，認爲此種措置的應付對象，就是聯蘇。此次蒙帥訪蘇頗出世人意料，蘇聯方面於初聞此訊時，亦有幾分驚奇。事實土，英美軍備的標準化，北極的防禦等等，或許僅僅是根據戰時的敎訓，以防萬一。猶如蘇聯在她的周環建立防禦環一樣，用不着多所猜疑。現在蒙帥到　聯去把其中的究竟，解釋解釋淸楚自可撥開一些籠罩於世界的疑雲。</p>
<h3>殖民地</h3>
<p>— 汪</p>
<p>殖民地的問題愈鬧愈烈，印度尼西亞，越南，印度……到處都是亂哄哄，找不到適當的解決辦法。照英法荷諸統治國家的說法，她們彷彿都沒有壓迫殖民地的意念，但是殖民地人民有其應有的自由和權利，決不甘長此以往　。</p>
<p>春秋</p>
<h3>春梅</h3>
<p>— 沁綠</p>
<p>「怪來怪去，我沒有個標緻媳婦送給保長。我這把年紀，還要自己到縣裏去完糧。前回，走到松岡，喘的接不上氣了，多虧曹三嫂的大兒子，好心的替我挑過了坡。好容易找到完糧的地方，那些人沈起個臉子，就像是我欠他的陳大麥，挑砂嫌稗子，只差點把我氣死了。我要是有個俏媳婦，我的糧就免了，又有那個敢放個屁不？」趙五婆端着一碗紅薯稀飯，向隔壁曹大爹家的長工，小冲叨嘮不休，她瞥見春梅正在穀塲上晒衣服，她便故意提高聲音說：</p>
<p>「男人音信全無，她還那樣有興緻，穿得紅是紅，綠是綠的。大概到底還是看中了那個老傢伙。」</p>
<p>小冲生怕惹禍，抽身走了。趙五婆這才住了嘴，捧着稀飯，暍得呼呼饗。</p>
<p>春梅裝着沒聽到，低着頭在那裏晒衣服。</p>
<p>「吃飯哪！」。她的婆婆呌了。她也不回答，提了木桶向家裏走去。趙五婆在背後向她做個鬼臉。</p>
<p>「天下的媳婦都見過，就只沒見過像你這樣一天到晚哭喪着臉的東西。王瞎子算命眞準，設你命帶煞星，一點都沒有錯，發根抽出去這幾年，遍一個字也沒有見到他的，那個敢相信他還活着？你看你兩塊山樣的顴骨，你的硬八字害了我們張家。」張達狠狠地說。</p>
<p>春梅默不作聲的端起桌上的玉米粥，忽然覺得一陣惡心，她連忙忍住，跑到房裏去。張婆走到門口去迎接正向道邊走過來的丁保長。</p>
<p>丁保長進來坐下，打量了一眼。張婆在旁邊看得明白，趕忙陪笑說：</p>
<p>「春梅越過越嬌了，嫌玉米粥不好吃，躱在房裏生氣哩！」</p>
<p>丁保長馬上皺了眉頭說：</p>
<p>「上回我給你的錢都用完了嗎？」他一邊掏出一把鈔票放在桌上。「以後再不要吃玉米粥了，揀他所愛吃的東西買，錢光了，再問我！」</p>
<p>丁保長慢吞吞地踱入春梅房裏去，一會兒，他喜溢眉宇的走出來，低低地對張婆說：</p>
<p>「你要好生招扶她，不要讓她做事。你曉得我家裏那個老八怪生了一大堆賠錢貨，到現在，我連一個兒子都沒有。</p>
<p>張婆望着丁保長走遠了，便回到自己房裏去拿了幾雙破襪子來交給春梅，「我今天要穿的，趕點忙替我補了。」她說完就到隔壁談閒話去了。</p>
<p>春梅收了碗，把廚房，堂屋都打掃乾凈，便坐下來補襪子。</p>
<p>她是十七歲嫁到張家來的，從做新姑娘的第一天起，就沒有過一天安寗的日子。她和丈夫感情還好，就爲了這一點，不知道受了婆婆多少氣。每逢張婆罵起來的時候，張發根便藉點事由出去了，春梅躱在房裏不敢出來。若是給婆婆看到紅腫着眼睛，她又要說慣會在男人面前撒嬌，唆使他對老娘不孝順。每逢傷心到極點的時候，春梅總是不由得的想起了她的母親。當她還是很小的時候，她的母親便常常在背地裏牽着她的乎流眼淚，怨老天瞎了眼，使她遇到這樣一個婆婆。</p>
<p>這幾年來，春梅謹愼地守着「婦道」。她忍受婆婆永無休止的辱駡，自從丈夫出征以後，婆婆的火氣更大了，她也忍耐下來，她認爲服侍婆婆也就算是對得起丈夫。</p>
<p>早在一年多以前，保長託人向張婆說，要娶春梅做二房。爲了道件事，春梅哭得死去活來，她娘家接她去住了些時，她到底放心不下婆婆無人侍候，便又堅持着回來了。終於，春梅在丁保長和張婆的騙局下上了當。想這也是命數，除了想起發根常常流根　　外，她也就很少想到別的了。對於今天早上趙五婆的議誚，她確感到一陣子的不安；一想到自己懷有身孕，她倒又感到幾分無名的驚喜。</p>
<p>「春梅在家嗎？」有人輕輕地問。</p>
<p>春梅抬頭一望，忽然一陣臉紅，跑進房去了，原來是以刁潑聞名的保長太太來了，她看春梅躱到房裏去，便也跟着進去了，隨手關了房門。一會兒，她出來走了。隨即春梅在房裏傳出一陣痛哭聲和呻吟聲……。</p>
<p>「天下找不到像這樣的懶東西，到這時候，還不開火弄飯，安心餓死老娘？」張婆一壁罵進來。</p>
<p>「我看你裝腔也裝够了，生兒育女是什麼奇事，用得着這樣做得嚇人！」她推開春梅的房門一望，驚呌了一聲，一把鼻涕，一把眼淚哭起來，也不管昏迷不省人事的春梅，就往丁保長家裏去了。</p>
<p>丁保長帶着人來了。他們先把春梅從樣上解下來放在床上，幾個人在狹小的房間裏忙得擠不開身。</p>
<p>「太遲了……。」張婆想到春梅平日待她的好處，天良發現忍不住鳴咽起來。</p>
<p>保長太太兩脚三步的趕來了撲在春梅身上，放聲大哭起來。</p>
<p>「春梅呀！我指望你替我們丁家接個香火……。」</p>
<p>張婆頹然地放下春梅的冰冷的手，掩着面走了出去……。</p>
<h3>夜讀隨筆</h3>
<p>— 李文勳</p>
<p>讀彭維爾詩論，主張寫詩應該像做數學裏的分數，儘可能弄得乾淨，光潔潔的，他底意思不外是說詩應該樸素，應該漂亮，他底論調利落可愛，而且熱情，他底詩篇不講對仗，尚情懷的自由，尤其看重自然之美，故而一翻開他底討篇就吻到百合玫瑰底香味，夜深人靜之時，樂章自天外冉冉而來，怪不得摩爾說他寗是個歌者而非詩人……</p>
<p>雪萊之死常常使我掩卷長嘆，嘆世間天才，爲何儘皆薄命，他底詩篇，雖然不是句句都是佳構，但像「日music　tohear　why　beheast　than　music　Sadlyi　sweets　witheets　uan　not　joy　dilights.in　joy.」</p>
<p>我覺得字字恰到好處，怎麼也不能再加個或删一個，假使換了中國詩人，一定又要大談「生風尼」，「朔拿大」和種種歡樂甜蜜的理論，把美好的意境拆得鷄零狗碎，摩爾之所以愛雪萊至死不渝，也就在他底溫柔，深遠的形而上的氣氛。</p>
<h3>巴比仲風景</h3>
<p>— 柯洛</p>
<p>柯洛（Jean　Baptiste　Camille　Corot　1796-1875）是純粹的巴黎人。他前期的作品，是古典的，自厭倦了巴黎之後，到了巴比仲作風就有了轉變，忠實于自然，創出獨特的風格。後期作品以風景居多，色彩典雅，筆調輕鬆，構圖尤為巧妙，整個畫面，呈露着幽雅的詩的氣氛。平生製作產量豐富，僅美國現存者已有三千餘幅。此圖爲油畫，現藏于法國巴黎羅佛宮。（獅）</p>
<h3>夢外樓詩</h3>
<p>— 徐澄宇</p>
<p>同非百江樓夜坐即贈</p>
<p>霸略王圖跡已陳，今來才調更無倫。休言玄理通三昧，且向雲中避十秦。桔梗鷄　俱有帝，荷衣薰帶亦猶人。江樓坐對西山月，此是神州萬古身。</p>
<p>題喻老齊詩卷</p>
<p>南國詩人有喩君，江山文藻惜芳薰。携將梅嶺天中月，寫入松花紙上雲。定草已堪傳玉簡，神州猶未靖餘氛。吟懷莫更添哀怨，多恐遺黎不忍聞。</p>
<p>百戰秋柯葉未凋，虛堂坐聽雨如潮。安身心境歸平淡，供眼江山任寂寥。水漲羣雛鳬味雋，天空孤羽雁　遙。人間萬業憑流轉，獨當當門十丈蕉。</p>
<p>故人家住南充城，城上烟花覆春雲。故人精舍城西道，講席紛綸揮衆妙。不獨名墨入微茫，直追漆園湖厲鄉。招我西山遊履遍，眼中無復白鹿院。餘事猶將鑄堯舜，正俗何難雅風變。百年人物非等閒，嗟予力弱媿陶甄。來歲春光浮漢水，雲中回首是西山。</p>
<p>將去西山先有此作</p>
<p>三月嘉陵春欲暮，去人白日又堂堂。當軒積翠雲千疊。背嶺搖空水一方。石磴花疏留夢雨，桐枝鷺老送餘　。明年此際還相憶，芳草晴川似漢陽。</p>
<p>青居山口占</p>
<p>巉　天半擁高臺，故壘雲空夕照開。幾輩中流成砥柱，靑山無恙我重來。</p>
<p>貝爾在他底「藝術論」裏論文學團體及幫系藝術完全是個抬框子的機關，天才一來便打，打不過便駡你落伍，駡你腐朽，把框子往你頭上一套，於是Barbizon底天才畫家也祗好逃出巴黎到芳綠的田園，連最好的天才如梵高者也祗能坐咖啡館，擺龍門陣，甚至後來在他所愛的日光下瘋狂而自殺，梵樂希底命運也差不了多少，天下像席勒道樣軟硬不怕的詩人還是很少，假如我有才如拜倫，一定要像他那樣向「愛丁堡」袞袞諸公挑殊死之戰，但可惜我缺少他底才氣，說得有點狂妄了。</p>
<p>紀德底兩次轉向都被世人所注意，但很少有人肯從他底愛心上着眼，紀德是個詩人，除了生命與眞理以外，不會說出別的阿諛和虛僞，他底哲學上的苦惱和種種人世的矛盾衝突也許幷未被世人所看出，讀他底剛果旅行和意大利旅行書簡，那花香的城市和陽光的國家，和翡冷翠底光景步調種種迷人的思想和風景，丰滿得像要滴出水來，紀德對於人生未來的盼望何其熱情，蘋菓熟透了讓人人底嘴去凑牠，天國底盛宴讓人人都被邀請，紀德眞是個可愛的詩人，肯用心力的談說人生，他底愛心和熟情使人深受感動。</p>
<p>讀法國詩人維尼底查太頓悲劇，人世的冷酷和世態的炎凉令人毛骨悚然，這是個眞實的人物，湯馬士·查太頓·十九世紀英國底靑年詩人，二十三歲的時候帶着他底全部詩稿到了人文薈萃的倫敦大城，想把他底那些優美的詩篇像孩子般的向人展覽，但得到的却是嘲笑和挪揄，沒有一個人稍加靑睞，他冷淸淸的住在一個租貨的小屋裏，沒有一個朋友，沒有一個親人，在冬天的寒夜裏瑟瑟發抖，飢寒交迫，却想不到會有一個女人同情他，愛他底年輕和才華，偷偷的接擠到錢幣和麵包，這個女人就是他底房東太太，年靑貌美，而且熟情，有着良好的善心，但這個善良和美麗對於詩人重傷的心顯然已無法治痊，在一個雪夜裏他呑下了大量砷毒，悄悄的逃出了這個卑惡的人間，這個結局已够悲慘但想不到他死了以後，那些「至聖先師」似的「文壇導師」又大加賞識，開起追悼會來，出他底作品專集……這情形就更悲慘。</p>
<p>美國安那其學者何德著「天堂對話」天堂雖寂寞，儘是人情，人間雖熱鬧滿紙荒唐，眞是說不出的感慨，讀後哀思奔湧，不過如托爾斯泰所說的，「神之王國」原來就在人類自己的心裏，前前後後的心潮都是一種境界，就好此走路拐灣，有糞坑，有花園，就看你怎麼個走法了。</p>
<p>人生意養，雖是個千古爭吵的題目，但綜觀尼采及托爾斯泰底見解，也不外是在求人生的昇華，不過路徑不同，方向祇有一個，人類生來不肯安份，人生也眞像個愚蠢的鬧劇，也許原沒有什麽悲喜愛憎，托爾斯泰說凡百學術，假使說理不照目的，便毫無意義可言，他底理論基礎在於一種集團和牠底利益—道德。尼采底所謂：「創以為予，予而未憐」，則在集團之外，假如說世界底重心仍在人類，則托爾斯泰底說法自然正確，但假使我們以天理底圓全上着眼，則眞理似屬尼采，兩人都是從「心」出發，而結果意外的背道而馳，到量後又不免殊途同歸。托爾斯泰底苦心使人感動，尼采底用功使人佩服，但再讀讀「弗浴伊特叙傳」，他底爲學好勝之心，尤勝尼采，不但思想家如此，就是好的詩人也是一樣的，紀德在「新的糧食」裏面論人生底最高標的，應該看重慾望，看重現在，看重將來，看重解放，看重創造，他底奔放的熱情眞像尼采……這樣看來，我們實在必須充實，必須做事，必須痛苦，打仗必須强身，文章必須扎實。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血146</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>劍在我國古兵器中，是個聖品，普通武行，拿牠不起。但明明一把校刀，日本人苦苦的說他是劍，是個什麽道理，他們稱爲「柔道」的大的僅僅我國武藝的緒餘；但世界上的光眼瞎子，都說這是東方拳術，概括了一切，而且還要嘖嘖地稱道日本拳術厲害。就這一點名稱小事，也够人嘔氣。</p>
<p>武藝，或是拳術，談何容易。所謂日本拳術，僅僅我國一種拌角，或稱跌撲手脚，雖說是拳術之一種，却不能把來概括一切武藝。再說「劍道」，就日人現在的「劍法」看，頭一個「雙手一把抓」，就離劍法至少也有十萬八千里的遠近。就那劈撥刴斬四個手法，却明明是校刀手，人人必須知道運用的幾個初步方式，是舊日下級兵卒上陣肉搏的「救命招」。　拿這一點點東西，苦苦的說是劍道，那要呌內行笑掉下巴了。那高級的校刀，使發起來還有一百〇八步法，三十六種手法；步分虛實，手有陰陽，步和手處處相應，那才是校刀的格式。日本現行的這四手救命招，連上乘的校刀手法都够不上，那裏配稱是劍道？</p>
<p>然而日本的「劍道」，也有幾百千把年歷史，居然也把撥弄的程度分爲六級九道，當眞竟連一些些「道」理也沒有嗎？那也不盡然。俗話說，「下得功夫深，鐵杵磨成針」，大凡一種技能，獨怕不肯下功夫，肯下功夫話，哪怕沒有正宗師傳，功夫久了，也可磨出一些道理來。</p>
<p>所以日本劍道，自從分為六級九道以來，據說就沒有一個人到過第六級第九道。六級的說法，在明治維新以前，就已停止通行，只存九道。他們的古今劍道大師，只有很少的幾個人練到過第八道；所謂第八道，實際上是第七道末段，日人天性好誇張，到了七道末段，反正沒人敢同他較量，死無對證，也只好讓他信口胡吹了</p>
<p>那七道末段，或說第八道，究竟有什麽厲害呢？原來劍道練到了這一道竟是把普通手法，一齊放下不用，或是說，一齊融化，成功一種不講手法的手法，這種手法，稱爲「以心運劍」；正合我國太極拳法，「以心行意，以意使氣，以氣運用五官百骸」大同小異。這以心運劍的好處在那裏呢？就同太極拳法一個樣：「彼不動，己不動；彼欲動，已先動」。換句話，就是拿自己報心意來尅制敵人的心意，自己以神運劍，劍神相合無間。所以說日本「劍道」，竟也廣出了些不小的道理了。</p>

<h3>Negotiations in Shanghai Conclude Temporarily; Overall Situation Remains Uncertain in the Near Future; Sun Ke, Zhang Qun, and Lei Zhen Returned to Nanjing Last Night</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] Neutral sources indicate that after a period of negotiations in Shanghai, the focus of peace talks will soon shift to Nanjing. It is reported that the Communist Party is paying close attention to the government's specific proposals and is eager to learn how the government intends to resolve the military and political issues between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. They believe that whether negotiations can proceed depends entirely on the government's attitude towards the two points raised by the Communist Party.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Sun Ke, Zhang Qun, and Lei Zhen all took the night train yesterday to Nanjing to report on their mission, while Wu Tiecheng remains in Shanghai. Lei told reporters in a hurried manner that he visited Zhang Junmai yesterday to inquire about his eye ailment. He stated that Zhang will go to Nanjing as soon as his eye condition improves. The government currently has no concrete plan to resolve the current situation, and everything needs to be decided after detailed discussions in Nanjing. Lei believes that if efforts are needed to mediate the resumption of peace talks, all parties are willing to assist. However, as of now, both direct negotiations and mediation efforts are still being considered. There is currently no new basis for resuming peace talks, but the government has full sincerity. If the Communist Party changes its attitude, peace talks can be quickly resumed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] Lei Zhen returned to Nanjing last night. Before his departure, he told reporters that how to resume peace talks depends on the government's decision after discussion. Regarding the steps to reopen peace talks, the government will certainly put forward a plan first as a basis for negotiations with the Communist Party. The government has long planned to send personnel to Yan'an, but the selection of candidates has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Government representatives Zhang Qun and Lei Zhen, Youth Party representatives Li Huang and Zuo Shunsheng, and Social Democratic Party representatives Wu Xianzi and Wan Gongqian, etc., held their last exchange of views in Zhang Qun's private residence yesterday before the government representatives went to Nanjing. During the talks, both the Youth Party and the Social Democratic Party expressed their support for President Sun's proposal to convene a party roundtable meeting. Neither party put forward a plan to resolve the current difficult situation. According to someone who participated in the talks, the government also has no concrete plan at present. As for the method of resuming military peace talks, it has not yet been decided. However, the government is prepared to send representatives to Yan'an, but whether peace talks can be realized soon depends entirely on the attitude of the Communist Party. Given the current situation, it is difficult to expect the overall situation to improve in the short term.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] Jiang Yuntian of the Social Democratic Party visited Zhang Zhizhong at 6:00 PM on the 12th to exchange views. According to Jiang, the party is very satisfied with Sun Ke's proposal to convene a roundtable meeting. He believes that the Communist Party will not oppose it verbally, but hopes that no specific conditions will be put forward, as this would only cause both parties to become deadlocked. Jiang explained that the party's recent efforts are all aimed at promoting the early resumption of peace talks, and believes that if both parties can make mutual concessions and trust each other, everything will not be difficult to resolve. Jiang refused to speculate on the focus of the roundtable meeting's discussions. When asked about the party's view on Marshal Ma's statement, Jiang said: "Marshal Ma's statement is both just and fair, which shows that he has grasped the core of the problem during his time in China." Jiang stated that he would not go to Shanghai in the short term, and Zhang Junmai is suffering from a severe cold, so it is uncertain whether he will come to Nanjing.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] Zhou Qianchong, a standing committee member of the Youth Party, came to Nanjing on the 11th and had a brief meeting with Ambassador Stuart and Shao Lizi, and then went to Shanghai that evening.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the National Assembly, came to Shanghai on business a few days ago and took a military plane back to Nanjing last night. It is reported that before leaving Shanghai, Hong had private friendly meetings with Zhang Junmai and Zeng Qi.</p>

<h3>Twenty-Four Chinese Passengers Were All Scheduled to Fly to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[United Press, this city, 12th] The Liaodong Air Transport Company's four-engine Constellation aircraft, "Miss Luzon," carrying 24 Chinese passengers and 6 British passengers, was forced to land in the sea north of Luzon Island on the 11th due to weather conditions that prevented it from landing at Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong. The aircraft departed from Shanghai on the 11th with a crew of 12, including 5 Americans and the rest Filipinos. Among the 30 passengers, only two Chinese passengers were going to Manila, and the remaining 28 were going to Hong Kong.

<h3>Marshal Ma Will Arrive in the United States This Week; Reportedly, There is No Evidence of Soviet Aid to the Chinese Communist Party; US Senators Advocate That US Troops Should Remain in China</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 11th] Regarding the replacement of the old and new US Secretaries of State, it has been learned that Byrnes will continue to serve as Secretary of State until the 14th of this month, and the new Secretary of State, Marshal Marshall, will arrive in Washington in early or mid-next week. Marshall is now in Hawaii, meeting with his wife. Byrnes has received a private letter from him. According to White House Press Secretary Ross this morning, President Truman has allowed Marshall to decide his date of arrival in Washington.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 12th, Honolulu broadcast: Marshall said regarding the claim that he will attend the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, that this is just an assumption.</p>
<p>[United Press, Honolulu, 11th] Marshal Marshall informally met with reporters at Fort Shafter here today. He said that the recent anti-American sentiment expressed by Chinese students was instigated by someone, but he did not specify who was behind it. He also said that there is no evidence that the Chinese Communist Party has received Soviet aid. Marshall said: "I quite wanted to retire and live a private life. Being appointed as Secretary of State is a new calling, and I will do my best to fulfill my national duty." When asked whether the new position is more important than his wartime Chief of Staff of the Army position, Marshall replied: "In one sense, I think the new position is more important. I was originally a soldier, and now I will take on a new mission. Leading a war is certainly difficult, but this is my lifelong career." Marshall did not comment on the reaction to his departure statement from China.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th] Four members of Congress today advocated that the United States should at least station some troops in China as a symbol to guarantee America's concern for China's restoration of stability and to prevent Soviet influence. These four congressmen expressed their opinions separately on the statement made by Special Envoy Marshall upon his departure from China. Among them, Representative Short, a member of the House Military Affairs Committee, inspected China last autumn. He said: "We really have no choice. If the US military withdraws from China, Soviet influence will immediately spread throughout China." Others, such as Republican member Marley and Democratic member Sykes, have also traveled to China. The plane said: "The US military must remain stationed in China, half for defense against the Soviet Union and half for stabilizing the opposing Chinese forces." Martin also said: "The withdrawal of US troops from China will only make the Soviet Union more aggressive in China. He is willing to accept any suggestions from Marshall."</p>

<h3>Mining and Transportation Industries Encourage Investment from All Sectors; The Ministries of Finance and Economy Have Drafted Measures</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 12th] The Ministries of Finance and Economy have recently taken various measures to encourage investment from all sectors in the mining and transportation industries. The Supreme National Defense Council has approved ten articles jointly drafted by the two ministries as the basis for calculating the old shares of mining and shipping companies according to the current legal tender, in order to accommodate new shares. An official from the Ministry of Economic Affairs explained that many mining and shipping companies are feeling a shortage of funds and have applied for government loans. These companies cannot absorb new investments to increase operating funds because old shareholders do not know the current value of the shares they purchased years ago, so they do not welcome new investments. The purpose of formulating the regulations is to eliminate this obstacle. The method is that old shares can be calculated according to the current price index, so as to absorb new investments.</p>

<h3>One Year of Mediation Work</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 12th] Today is the first anniversary of the establishment of the Executive Headquarters of the Military Mediation Department in Beiping. As of tonight, the 12th, no commemorative ceremony has been heard from any party.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] With the flames of war spreading and peace talks dimming, Marshal's return to the United States has increased national concern about the future survival of the Military Mediation Department. Established in Beiping on January 13, 1946, it has reached its anniversary. Recalling the gains and losses of the mediation work over the past year, a comprehensive analysis and report are provided below:</p>
<p>(1) Efforts and Failures of the Mediation Work Over the Past Year:</p>
<p>January: On the 10th, the government issued a ceasefire order, effective from midnight on the 13th. On the same day, Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) issued a ceasefire order. On the 13th, the Military Mediation Department was established in Beiping. Three committee members, Robertson, Deputy Chief of the US Embassy; Zheng Jiemin, Director of the Second Department of the Military Command; and Ye Jianying, Chief of Staff of the 18th Group Army, flew to Beiping together. From the outset, the Military Mediation Department actively started its work, dispatching ceasefire execution groups to various conflict areas and issuing Order No. 1, ordering the National Army and Communist Army near Yongnian to cease conflict. Order No. 2 conveyed the principles and methods for implementing the ceasefire. National Army generals in various regions received the ceasefire order and complied with it, welcoming the Gu mediation teams to carry out their missions and providing them with convenience. On the 23rd, the Luoshan Agreement was established to cease the conflict. From midnight on the 13th, the Communist Army in various parts of North China continued to attack the National Army, successively capturing Yingkou in the Northeast; Zichuan and Boshan in Shandong; Yutian and Fengrun in Hebei; Mengxian and Kaocheng in Henan; Houma and Fushan in Shanxi; and Jining in Suiyuan. From the 14th, the Communist Army in northern Jiangsu destroyed the eastern section of the Longhai Railway and occupied the Jiaoji Railway and Zihudian and Jieshou stations on the Jinpu Railway, which were originally guarded by the National Army. The towns of Liancheng, Dezhou, Changqing, Tai'an, and Yanzhou in Shandong; Qin County and Wenxi in Shanxi; and Botou and Yongnian in Hebei continued to be besieged by the Communist Army. In addition, 40,000 troops were transferred by the Communist Army in Shanxi, entering the Northeast via Pingquan and Jianchang in Rehe.</p>
<p>February: Government and CCP representatives discussed the reorganization and unified compilation of troops in Chongqing. On the 25th, the "Basic Plan for Military Reorganization" was signed in Chongqing, stipulating that the national army, including the Communist Army, would be reorganized in two phases. The Military Mediation Department established a joint staff headquarters, continuing to send execution teams to areas within the Communist Army's territory and dispatching several transportation teams to various railway lines damaged by the CCP to assist in supervising repairs, and began the work of repatriating Japanese prisoners and overseas Chinese. During the same month, the Beiping Military Mediation Department issued Order No. 3, resolving disputes over the issue of puppet troops; Order No. 4, instructing methods for restoring transportation; and Order No. 5, instructing matters related to the repatriation of prisoners. The ceasefire execution teams sent to various regions encountered the most thorny issue of puppet troops. After several consultations, an agreement was finally reached. Order No. 3 of the Military Mediation Department stipulated that the puppet troops recognized by the government or the CCP and their opposing forces should maintain their positions as of midnight on January 13, or as determined by the execution team. The puppet troop issue was finally resolved, while the Communist Army continued to besiege the towns it had been besieging the previous month. Xiao Ke's troops captured Jianping and Jianchang in Rehe. The Communist Army in Hebei attacked Dongguang again and continued to destroy the Jiaoji, Pinghan, and Jinpu railways, hindering mediation work. The Communist Army in Tai'an surrounded a mediation team, robbing them of materials. In the Northeast, they actively prepared for war. Over 10,000 troops from the Communist Army in Hebei entered the Northeast by land through eastern Hebei and Rehe, and over 40,000 troops from the Communist Army in Shandong were transported to the Northeast by sea. On the 9th, the Dezhou team agreement was signed to cease conflict and ensure the transport of grain and trade. On the 13th, the Houma team signed a temporary agreement in Linfen, guaranteeing transportation and communication. On the 15th, the Tai'an team signed the Tai'an Agreement, guaranteeing grain transport. All of these were subsequently violated by the CCP.</p>
<p>March: Mediation work reached its peak. The three representatives of the Military Three-Person Group, Zhang Zhizhong, Marshall, and Zhou Enlai, jointly inspected Zhangjiakou, Jining, Guihua, Taiyuan, Jinan, Xuzhou, Hankou, and other places to supervise the cessation of conflict in order to thoroughly implement the ceasefire order. At the same time, the government agreed to extend the mediation work to the nine northeastern provinces. On the 22nd, the Military Mediation Department issued Order No. 6, confirming the positions of all troops as of midnight on January 13. On the Communist Army side, they launched an offensive in the Northeast. Lin Biao's troops captured Sipingjie, preventing the National Army from moving north to take over sovereignty. The Communist Army in Rehe attacked Lingyuan and Chaoyang. The Communist Army of Jin-Cha-Ji (Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei) entered the Northeast by land, reaching 80,000 troops. During the same month, the National Army began reorganization, while the Communist Army greatly expanded. The conscription movement was prevalent in the "Liberated Areas." The original New Fourth Army and 18th Group Army entered the Northeast, retaining their original designations in the interior and replenishing their forces. All of this increased the difficulty of mediation work. The mediation work of the teams in various regions was also very active in March, successively establishing the Dangba Agreement, the Chaoyang Agreement, the Dongming Agreement, the Datong Agreement, and the Jianchang Agreement, stipulating the cessation of conflict or mutual withdrawal in their respective regions.</p>
<p>April: The Communist Army launched a major offensive in the Northeast, and the conflict spread. On the 15th, Xu Yongchang, Minister of Military Affairs and representative of the Military Three-Person Group, sent Qin Decun, Vice Minister, along with General Qing Lan, representative of Marshal's special envoy, and Zhou Enlai, representative of the CCP, to inspect the Northeast and seek peace. The Communist Army in the Northeast successively captured Harbin, Qiqihar, and Changchun. Over 10,000 troops from the Communist Army in Shandong and over 20,000 troops from the Communist Army in Shanxi continued to enter northern Jiangsu by sea and land. At the same time, the Communist Army in northern Jiangsu invaded Nantong, threatening Nanjing and Shanghai. They also continued to destroy transportation in the occupied areas, preventing repairs and refusing to allow the dispatch of military mediation teams to Changchun and Harbin. The first phase of the National Army's reorganization was announced as completed this month. On the 6th, the Jinan team signed an agreement guaranteeing the cessation of conflict and the exchange of materials. On the 7th, the Dezhou team signed the Botou Agreement, ceasing conflict. On the 14th, the Dongming Agreement was signed, stipulating the maintenance of original positions.</p>
<p>May: The CCP claimed that Li Xiannian's troops in the Central Plains Military Region were surrounded by the National Army. Xu Yongchang, government representative of the Military Three-Person Group, accompanied by Blue de Roude, the American Executive Director of the Military Mediation Department, and Zhou Enlai, representative of the CCP, went to inspect. The government provided Li's troops with cash, allowing them to purchase grain and transport wounded soldiers and their families to Henan. The Communist Army in various regions launched the "May Offensive." In the Northeast, the Communist Army gathered in the Sipingjie and Gongzhuling areas to prevent the National Army from moving north, with some troops attacking Anshan and Haicheng. In Shandong, they massively destroyed the Jiaoji Railway, besieging Jinan from three sides. The Communist Army on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway attacked Xushui and Dingxing. The Communist Army on the northern section of the Jinpu Railway detained representatives of the government and the United States from the 18th Transportation Team and occupied Botou Station. The Communist Army in northern Henan captured Dongming. The Communist Army in Rehe occupied Beipiao, destroying the mining area and attacking Pingquan. In the Northeast, the National Army, in order to take over sovereignty, was forced to defend itself after suffering countless attacks.

During this period, the Military Mediation Department established a Changchun branch and dispatched eight teams to Anshan, Hailong, Haicheng, Lafa, Dehui, Shuangchengpu, Qiqihar, and Sipingjie in the Northeast to ensure the effective cessation of conflict. In addition, approximately 3,000 soldiers from the "East River Column" of the Communist Army in Guangdong safely boarded ships and withdrew to Yantai with the assistance of the Eighth Team and local government and military authorities. During this month, the Communist Army refused to propose a deadline for implementing the military reorganization agreement, restoring transportation, and measures to cease conflict in the Northeast.

<h3>Sweeping Campaign Launched on the Pingjin Line National Army Recaptures Wuqing City Siege of Xianghe Relieved Langfang and Luofa Stabilized</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Tianjin, 12th] The Communist Army east of the Pingjin area took advantage of the National Army's defense gap to attack Wuqing County City on the morning of the 11th. After the National Army's reinforcements arrived, they launched a counterattack and recovered Wuqing by noon on the 12th. However, the actions of the Communist Army on the Pinghan, Beining, and Jinpu lines in the north clearly had a comprehensive plan. The people along the lines in the ice and snow will inevitably continue to suffer from the Communist Army's artillery fire.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Beiping, 12th] After the Communist Army cut off the Pingjin Highway and captured Wuqing, Beiping and Tianjin were affected, and food prices in Beiping soared today. Sun Tongzhong sent a telegram from Beijing, strictly ordering attention. The military leaders here went to the front line to direct the battle today. The reinforcements from Beiping and Tianjin arrived at their destinations along the railway and highway separately, and the sweeping battle began. The siege of Xianghe County City was relieved, and the garrison had launched an attack, successively recovering Matou, Anping, and Wangjiaquan on the Pingjin Highway. The crises at Langfang, Luofa, Shizhangzhuang, Yangcun, and other stations on the Pingjin Railway have been lifted. The Communist Army participating in this attack was the entire Zeng Yongya unit of the 14th Military Sub-district, claiming to have 10,000 people, with four or five regiments participating in the battle. The main force was half in Hexiwu and Wuqing west of the Grand Canal, and half in Baozhen and Dachangzhen north of Xianghe east of the Grand Canal. The situation in Tongxian and Daxing gradually stabilized, but the local losses were quite large wherever the Communist Army passed. The cocoon forts and public buildings were completely destroyed, and each rebuilt fort required 40 to 50 million yuan.</p>

Yesterday, trucks and cars traveled between the two places. However, it is reported that Communist troops are active in the suburbs. So far, there has been no large-scale military activity in Hebei Province, but it is generally expected that the Communist Army will expand its obstruction tactics to contain the larger National Army and limit its deployment to the Northeast. It has also been denied by military circles that the Communist Army is attacking near the Songhua River crossing northeast of Changchun and near Jilin.</p>

<h3>Difficult Transportation and Low Grain Prices Hurt Farmers Deep Crisis in Northeast Rural Areas Most Farmers Plan to Abandon Their Fields and Seek Other Ways Out</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Shenyang, 12th] The Northeast countryside is currently facing a severe crisis.

<p>[Our newspaper, Changsha, 10th] The 1.2 million dan of grain for the interest on the food vouchers for the 34th year in Hunan Province, which was due to expire, has been approved by the Executive Yuan for repayment.

At a meeting held by the Provincial Council a month ago, it was decided to use the funds in a centralized manner, with half going to the province and half going to the county, to carry out construction projects. However, the Changsha County Council, which opened recently, expressed disagreement with the original resolution of the Provincial Council, unanimously arguing that it should be returned to the grain people and should not be withheld or diverted.

<h3>One Year of Mediation Work</h3>
<p>Continued from the First Page</p>
<p>September: The Communist army in Shanxi is besieging Datong with increasing urgency. To relieve the siege of Datong, the troops of the 11th and 12th War Zones are preparing to attack Zhangjiakou. Fu Zuoyi's troops are stationed in Changning and Fengzhen. The Communist army in northern Jiangsu is stationed in Huaiyin and Huaian and launches an offensive on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, forcing the siege of Baoding, the seat of the Hebei Provincial Government.</p>
<p>October: Conflicts throughout the country become increasingly serious. The offensive by the Communist army in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway reaches its peak. The Nationalist army in Xushui, Wangdu, Rongcheng, Xincheng, Dingxian, and other places is attacked. Baoding is surrounded on all sides, and traffic between Pingbao and Baoshi is cut off. 200 kilometers of the railway is destroyed, and Tianjin and Beijing are under unprecedented threat. The Communist army in northern Shaanxi attacks Yulin. Special Envoy Marshall makes a suggestion for a ten-day ceasefire to save peace. The government accepts, but the CCP rejects it. The troops of the 12th War Zone entered Zhangjiakou on the 11th. Since the beginning of October, the Communist army has launched an offensive in the Northeast. During the same month, the representatives of the CCP in the mediation executive groups and the transportation groups within the country all requested withdrawal and returned to Peiping one after another.</p>
<p>November: The government issued a nationwide ceasefire order, effective from noon on the 11th. The Communist army in various places launched offensives again. In Shandong, Pingdu and Changyi were captured, Jiaoxian was besieged, and Jinan was attacked; in northern Jiangsu, both Huai'an and Huaiyin were attacked; in Shanxi, they continued to spy on Datong, and one unit attacked Fenhe in the west, besieging Yulin; within the Northeast, the representatives of the CCP in the task force all withdrew to Changchun, declaring to the government and American representatives in the Communist-occupied areas that they would not be responsible for security. The representatives of both parties were forced to withdraw to Changchun due to the situation.</p>
<p>December: Mediation work came to a complete standstill. However, the government and American representatives of the various executive groups remained stationed in the Nationalist-occupied areas inside and outside the customs. Communist troops in various places continued to harass. Within Hebei Province, Baoding continued to be besieged, threatening the Beijing-Ningbo line and the traffic line between Tianjin, Beijing and Baoding; within Shanxi Province, Zhongyang was attacked; within Shandong Province, Liancheng was fiercely attacked; within Chahar Province, the people of Chongli were massacred; another unit continued to destroy the Jiaoji Railway, hindering the project to close the breach in the Yellow River.</p>
<p>(II) Analysis of the Reasons Why Mediation Work Failed to Be Completed Smoothly:</p>
<p>The mediation work has been going on for a year. In addition to completing the work of sending Japanese prisoners of war home, it has failed to achieve the expected goals of a complete cessation of conflict, restoration of transportation, and reorganization of the army, which is regrettable. The main reasons for this are: first, the Communist army's continuous violation of orders to attack, sabotage transportation, and expand armaments, which directly impacted the mediation work; and second, the Communist army's obstruction of the task force's implementation of tasks in various places, which indirectly hindered the progress of the mediation work.</p>
<p>Details of the Communist army's violation of orders to attack and destroy transportation have been described in the aforementioned year of mediation. Since the ceasefire order on January 13, the Communist army has taken advantage of the Nationalist army's compliance with the order to cease fire and moved from remote mountainous areas to various railway lines, destroying railway tracks and besieging towns in order to control various transportation hubs and seize advantageous positions. In order to coordinate with the Northeast war, they launched an offensive in May, launching large-scale attacks in Rehe, Shandong, Henan, Hebei, and other places, shattering the hopes for peace that the executive groups had worked hard for for several months. Since the end of June, the Communist army has completely controlled Shandong and Shanxi, completing its encirclement strategy in North China, threatening the government on the one hand in order to gain an advantageous position in the negotiations, and on the other hand, simultaneously attacking the Nationalist army in Shandong, Henan, and Shanxi, preparing for a full-scale civil unrest in the event of failed negotiations. Since the beginning of July, the Communist army has launched a large-scale attack on cities and territories in North China and northern Jiangsu, thinking of completing the partitioning of North China, threatening the capital on the one hand to make the government lose its position and credibility in the peace talks, and on the other hand, completing the CCP's conspiracy of division and partitioning. At the same time, when the Communist army's offensives in various places were attacked, they launched an anti-American movement, slandering the US government and its policies, wantonly vilifying American mediators, and taking actions to threaten the safety of American mediation personnel. Since the ceasefire order took effect on January 13, they have continuously destroyed transportation and prevented repairs, making it impossible for the mediation work to progress. In addition, they have greatly expanded their military forces in various places inside and outside the customs, making the battlefield even wider, and the war has not ceased for a single day, causing the mediation work to come to a complete standstill.</p>
<p>In the past year, the Communist army indirectly advanced by delaying or restricting the task forces' personnel sent to various places from carrying out their missions. The most extreme manifestation of their obstruction of task force actions was the unauthorized detention of task force personnel, or even their murder. This type of fact has emerged endlessly in recent years. The most prominent cases are the killing of Major Lei Fenqiang of the 23rd Group in Yancheng by the Communist army on June 10, and the killing of Major Guo Ziqi, translator of the 10th Group of New 1st Army, in Sunzhuang on June 19. Major Min Qingchu was also shot and wounded. Later, at the end of July, the Communist army abducted seven US Marines in Beidaihe one after another, and fabricated the Xianghe incident, killing three American soldiers and injuring eleven. The motivation was also to threaten the safety of American mediation personnel. All of these are sufficient to force the mediation work to suffer unexpected difficulties.</p>
<p>Looking back on the mediation of the past year, although it failed to achieve the goal of complete peace, it has given us a clear understanding. Because its own gains and losses are a clear test, the CCP still blindly believes in force and does not take the path of peace. Today, the world and China both urgently need peace, and the unity and prosperity of our country depends even more on the early realization of peace. Mediation work is the only shortcut to achieving peace, and it is also a manifestation of the highest human wisdom. Although the efforts of the past year have not been fully successful, Chinese and foreign peace-loving people still place their earnest hope on this mediation mechanism. (End)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Restoring Peace Talks Should Begin with Sincerity!</h3>
<p>In recent days, Nanjing and Shanghai have been filled with an atmosphere of restoring peace talks. On the 9th, Mr. Peng Xuepei made a statement in Beijing, expressing that the government is willing to sincerely discuss concrete measures with the CCP regarding issues such as the cessation of conflict and the reorganization of the government. On the 10th, Mr. Sun Ke also made a suggestion on the current situation in Shanghai, advocating that all parties should hold a roundtable conference immediately. All parties attach great importance to the statements of Mr. Peng and Mr. Sun, so the atmosphere of restoring peace talks has become stronger in recent days. In today's extremely depressing situation, being able to breathe some air of peace talks is ultimately a gratifying phenomenon and cannot but be regarded as a ray of dawn for the future of the Chinese situation. At the same time, we cannot help but point out that the peaceful resolution of the KMT-CPC problem is the best opportunity today. The government, parties, and the people of the whole country must seize the opportunity in a timely manner, find ways to break the current political deadlock, and achieve the common desire of peaceful unification, democratic nation-building.</p>
<p>Since the completion of the constitution-making work of the National Assembly and its successful opening, our ordinary people have always focused their attention on the two things of restoring peace talks and reorganizing the government, eagerly waiting for the good news to spread. However, for the past fifteen days, the people's attention has moved with the whereabouts of government officials, sometimes in Nanjing and sometimes in Shanghai. They are almost straining their eyes to see, and at the same time, they are constantly worrying and anxious, fearing that the air of peace talks will be blown away again. Why do the people care so much about national affairs? The simple answer is because in the hearts of our 450 million people, there is a desire for "peaceful unification, democratic nation-building."</p>
<p>I remember during the arduous period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the people of the whole country endured hardship and were unwilling to give up their lives and property, bravely advancing and fighting the enemy to the death, and finally won the glory of victory. However, just as we were about to enjoy the peace, unification, and democratic nation-building, the happiness that the people of a victorious country should enjoy was swallowed up by the flames of war. Today, the people in the conflict areas are indeed in deep waters, and even the people in the recovered areas are suffering the most cruel impact of the war, so who would not long for the realization of peace!</p>
<p>The post-war world, like a patient recovering from a serious illness, cannot immediately return to health, which is of course natural. For example, countries such as Italy and Greece have all experienced civil wars after the war, but they have all been resolved satisfactorily. Now, only the KMT-CPC conflict in our country has been going on for a year and a half, with fighting and talking, and talking and fighting, without a peaceful resolution. How can our kind people not feel heartbroken? How can our kind people not hope for peace as much as drought hopes for rain clouds? To put it more concretely, today's China is full of dangers and crises. It is really too dangerous and too serious. It is more terrifying and dangerous than the darkest period of military discord during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Even if there is a good doctor who can prescribe medicine according to the symptoms, he will not be able to prescribe the following four prescriptions: (1) restore transportation; (2) develop industry and commerce; (3) reorganize and unify the army; (4) reform politics. However, if domestic peace and unification cannot be realized, then everything is out of the question. So peace is the only wide road to save China.</p>
<p>But why is peace as elusive as a spring dream? Our mediator, General Marshall, with his extraordinary wisdom, rare strategy, and unwavering confidence, ran for peace in China for eleven months, but still failed to bring peace to the Chinese people. However, when he was about to leave, he issued a statement explaining the crux of the transformation of the Chinese situation into its current state, which was the mutual suspicion between the KMT and the CPC. At the same time, he frankly pointed out that the Communist Party "does not trust the leaders of the Kuomintang at all. They seem to believe that all suggestions made by the government are nothing more than attempts to defeat the Communist Party." What General Marshall said is extremely pertinent and can be said to be to the point. We completely agree. And we believe that if the restoration of peace talks is to be successful, then the elimination of suspicion should come first. Sincerity should be valued.</p>
<p>The government's eagerness for peace is even above that of the people. Looking back at the peace talks over the past year, it is not difficult to prove that the government has indeed been sincere about peace talks in the past. Even today, the government is willing to restore peace talks with the CCP, not only with genuine sincerity, but also with great determination. If the attempts in Beijing and Shanghai cannot be successful, then the government will send senior officials to Yan'an, which is even more sufficient to illustrate the government's urgency in expecting the restoration of peace talks. Therefore, the problem with restoring peace talks now lies with the CCP, because the key to war and peace is still in the hands of the CCP. Not only does the CCP show indifference to the restoration of peace talks, but it also insists on its preconditions for restoring peace talks: (1) restore the military positions before January 10 last year; (2) abolish the constitution and dissolve the National Assembly. Regardless of whether the preconditions it proposes are reasonable, the fact that the CCP must propose preconditions for restoring peace talks is a sign of a lack of sincerity. "Without sincerity, there is nothing." Even if peace talks are reluctantly restored, I am afraid that no peace will be discussed? Why bother?</p>
<p>We have always believed that the peaceful resolution of the KMT-CPC problem is the best opportunity today. For the sake of the country and the nation, and also for the sake of the Communist Party itself, the CCP must seize the opportunity in a timely manner and must not miss this valuable opportunity again. The CCP's stubborn style in recent years really needs to be reconsidered. If it continues to be obsessed with its own ideas, it will not only be subject to the accusations and abandonment of the people of the whole country, but also lose the sympathy of various democratic countries. The speech given by Senator Vandenberg, chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in Cleveland the day before yesterday on the 11th, is worthy of the CCP's attention. As the saying goes, "Those who are virtuous will receive much help, while those who are unjust will receive little help." The CCP should especially be vigilant. If the CCP flatly denies the constitution passed by the National Assembly, there is really no reason for it. No matter from which perspective you observe it, this new constitution can be said to be a democratic constitution based on the principles of the Political Consultative Conference. Since the CCP supports the PCC resolutions, why should it oppose the constitution based on the PCC principles? Furthermore, if the CCP insists on restoring the military positions of January 10 last year, it is even more likely to make people suspect the CCP's true intentions. Why doesn't the CCP propose more opinions on the current situation, and only plan for its own territory? We are willing to frankly tell the CCP that these two preconditions are not only unacceptable to the government, but also that our ordinary people will not agree to the CCP's demands.</p>
<p>However, we believe that the problem in China today is not the problem of any one party or faction, but the problem of the entire country and the entire nation. Therefore, we ask all parties to increase their centripetal force towards the nation and the country, and reduce the centrifugal force caused by partisan prejudices. Now is the best time to solve the KMT-CPC problem, so the government, parties, and the people of the whole country should seize the opportunity in a timely manner, adopt the roundtable conference method proposed by Mr. Sun Ke, immediately resume peace talks without conditions, everyone should calm down, put aside all partisan interests and prejudices, review the past, discuss the future, and in the spirit of mutual trust and mutual concession, find a new path for the current difficult situation, so that China can embark on the path of peaceful unification, democratic nation-building as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In short, restoring peace talks should begin with eliminating suspicion, and sincerity should be valued. We advocate the immediate and unconditional restoration of peace talks, but we do not care about the way of peace talks, whether it is a roundtable conference or a party conference, as long as everyone can have a spirit of mutual trust and mutual concession, any difficult problem can be easily solved. The Chinese nation, with its good sense, will peacefully resolve domestic disputes, and we do not believe that it is helpless. Even more, we do not believe that it will perish from now on, because during the War of Resistance Against Japan, we firmly believed that the War of Resistance would be victorious, and we fought for eight years and finally won the final victory. Now, we believe that nation-building will be successful, as long as everyone can put the country first, peace first, and meet with sincerity, we will soon be able to win peace!</p>

<h3>Key Figure in the Nanjing Massacre, Traitor Zheng Fengshi, Under Interrogation; Captured While Serving as an Underground County Magistrate, He Betrayed the Country and Sold Out Patriots; His Crime Is Undeniable, and He Cunningly Claims to Have Been Forced by the Enemy</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch] The defendant Zheng Fengshi served as the director of the Civil Affairs Office of the Jiangnan Administrative Office during the period of the occupation. He was then transferred to the position of underground county magistrate of Taicang. In 1944, he was detected and arrested by the enemy's gendarmerie in Changshu. Zheng's will was not firm. During the three months of his imprisonment, he used a pencil to write a book titled "Details of the Crackdown on the Southern Jiangsu Guerrilla Area," one foot high and 32 open, which contained detailed records of the names, duties, addresses, and resumes of various underground workers. In Taicang County alone, he exposed as many as 108 underground KMT members. After completing the book, he presented it to Mi Chuncun, the head of the enemy's gendarmerie, known as the "Wolf of Changshu," in exchange for his personal freedom and preferential treatment. He was then able to take up the position of puppet district chief of the 7th District of Taicang. As a result, the enemy was able to use this book as a basis to launch the horrific Nanjing Massacre. About 20 members of the Taicang local party headquarters were arrested. Countless central underground workers in other places were arrested or killed. After the victory, the families of the victims, Lu Dashou, Chen Jinhua, and others, jointly filed a lawsuit with the Jiangsu High Prosecutor's Office. Zheng was arrested and brought to justice. After several trials by the Suzhou High Court, the newly appointed judge, Chuan Chaoyang, brought him to court again on the 10th for trial, and summoned the plaintiffs and the Changshu enemy gendarmes Lu Chunhua and Jin Shouhui, who had already been sentenced and detained, to testify in court. They jointly claimed that they had been forced to do so by the enemy and that it was not voluntary, and requested the court to give them a lighter sentence. As a result, the court ordered them to be sent back to prison and scheduled a retrial.</p>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 12th] Du Zhean, who served as a member of the puppet Reformed Government Council and the puppet Jiangsu Province First District Administrative Inspector, and other puppet positions, fled without a trace after the victory. The Suzhou Office of the Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics sent a letter to the Suzhou High Prosecutor's Office, requesting that the Investigation Office of the Army Headquarters investigate. After verification, the Suzhou High Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution today and will issue an arrest warrant.</p>

<h3>Notorious Bandit in Yueqing Executed</h3>
<p>Attempted Escape After Capture, Shot Dead on the Spot</p>
<p>[Our Wenzhou Dispatch] Notorious bandit Chen Bangfa, who had been hiding in Shangjia Yang, Chang'an Township, Yueqing Liushi District, was wanted by the Yongjia Eighth District Administrative Review Commissioner's Office for committing numerous crimes. It is now known that on the night of December 21st of last year, Lou Qinzhang, the captain of the county's criminal police team, led several officers to arrest him. After being escorted to the county and briefly interrogated, he was deemed guilty. The county government, recognizing that the bandit was already wanted by the Eighth District Commissioner's Office, decided to return him for trial. Therefore, at approximately 12:00 PM on the 6th of this month, two officers from the Second Squadron of the Security Police were dispatched to escort the bandit to the steamboat wharf, preparing to transport him by boat to the Yongjia Commissioner's Office for trial. Unexpectedly, while being escorted outside the West Gate and about to disembark, the bandit feigned a need to urinate and seized the opportunity to escape. The two escorting officers, seeing the bandit fleeing, immediately opened fire in pursuit, fatally wounding him. The incident was reported to the Yueqing District Court Procuratorate, which dispatched personnel to verify the death and prepare a coffin for burial.</p>
<h3>Bandit Leader from Haining Escorted to Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Linked to Multiple Robberies in Lake Hub</p>
<p>[Our Haining Dispatch] The county police recently uncovered a bandit den in the Zhouwangmiao Township area at the beginning of the month, capturing bandit leader Zhu Zhongliang and five accomplices: Lu Xintian, Chen Baokang, Dai Zhongfei, and Hua Shaoyan. The county government has now received a telegram from the Provincial Security Command stating that bandit leader Zhu Zhongliang and others are linked to a series of major robberies that occurred in Lake Hub, Hangzhou. They were ordered to send someone to the county to take them into custody and escort them to Hangzhou. After uncovering the aforementioned bandit den, the county police, knowing that other bandits such as Chai Yongmao, Wang Wanlin, Chai Yucai, and Zhu Renquan were still at large, continued to deploy a police network to conduct secret searches. Recently, another gang of four bandits was captured in the urban area. The bandits resisted arrest with firearms, but the police officers subdued them with forceful punches. According to their confessions, the bandits, named Wang A'da (from Tou Peng), He Zhenglin (from Tou Peng), Xu A'rong (from this county), and Chen Wenqin (from Pujiang), had committed over ten robberies in areas such as Chang'an, Wangdian, Jiaxing, Jiashan, Tongxiang, Jinshidun, and Xujia'er.

Robberies of Jiang Yangshan in Zihang Village and Luo Shunxing's rice boat in Jianhua Tang have been reported several times in the past half-month. At the same time, bandit activity has also been detected in the Zhouzhuang Township area of Luxu, with the bandits moving around unpredictably. It is reported that this gang of bandits is led by Zhou Shiguan, a member of the executed notorious bandit Li Defu's group, and they are carrying "Kaping" fast-firing weapons and other arms, robbing boats in broad daylight.

During the robbery, the robbers ordered the store owner, Xu Desheng, to hand over cash. As a result, 200,000 yuan in cash and over 10 million yuan in counterfeit currency were given to the robbers. In the darkness, the robbers mistakenly believed that it was all legal tender and fled in great excitement.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Sericulture Management Committee Holds Symposium to Discuss Spring Silkworm Plan; Agricultural Bank Issues 120 Billion in Cocoon Loans</h3>
<p>[Our Wuxi Dispatch] The Jiangsu Sericulture Improvement and Management Committee will hold a symposium from the 6th to the 15th of this month to discuss the 36th-year spring silkworm rearing guidance plan. Representatives from silkworm breeding improvement areas in various counties in Jiangnan, as well as silkworm advisory personnel, seed breeding farms, silk factories, cocoon brokers, silkworm seed industry associations, and Agricultural Bank representatives from the Beijing-Shanghai railway line, will all come to Wuxi to participate, review, and improve the sericulture and silk plan. The total amount of spring and autumn silkworm seeds for various farms this year will be over 10,000, with the price of each sheet of seeds set at 5,500 to 7,000 yuan. However, it is believed that the failure of the sericulture industry is largely due to the failure to establish silkworm rearing guidance centers universally, and the low quality of silkworm cocoons produced is unprecedented in decades. The current spring seed distribution is tentatively set at 600,000 sheets, with each unit collectively incubating 10,000 sheets, requiring the establishment of 60 incubation centers. 300,000 sheets of young silkworms will be collectively reared, with each unit rearing 500 sheets, requiring the establishment of 600 collective rearing centers. Currently, the rural economy is bankrupt, and the Central Agricultural Bank has drafted a loan implementation plan to assist farmers in production. Farmers in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces engaged in mulberry cultivation, silkworm rearing, cocoon drying, and silk reeling can obtain low-interest loans totaling 240 billion yuan, with cocoon collection loans totaling 120 billion yuan, Jiangsu and Zhejiang sericulture loans totaling 27.2 billion yuan, Jiangsu sericulture production loans totaling 4 billion yuan, cooperative cocoon drying loans totaling 1.5 billion yuan, and collective incubation and rearing of young silkworms and mulberry garden equipment loans totaling 900 million yuan, all repayable in installments over three years. Currently, there are 108 seed breeding farm units and 50 guidance units in Jiangsu Province, and it has been decided to expand them and establish 500 collective rearing groups to universally guide silkworm rearing work and complete the path to recovery.</p>
<h3>Reorganizing the Scenic Yandang Mountains; Management Office to Resume Next Month</h3>
<p>[Our Wenzhou Dispatch] The Yandang Mountains, one of the famous mountains in southeastern China, is located east of Yueqing, facing the sea to the southeast, bordering Yongjia to the west, and reaching Huangyan to the north, stretching through nine townships, including Dajing and Yandang, covering an area of 180 li in circumference. The natural scenery is unparalleled, with 120 unique peaks that change shape with every step. The Longqiu Waterfall is misty and rainy in all seasons, and there is a lake on the mountain top, covering tens of acres, which visitors praise as a spectacle. The late Jian Tao Uncle has a saying, "It is difficult to write about Longqiu, traveling to Yandang in the lower reaches is a waste." The entire mountain has 444 natural scenic spots, and other man-made features include temples, Taoist buildings, pavilions, and ancient pagodas that dot the landscape. The Yandang Mountain Construction Committee and Yandang Mountain Scenic Area Management Office were originally established to carry out construction, and long-distance telephones were installed and automobile branch roads were built. At that time, visitors from all over the world came to visit in an endless stream. However, with the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, everything came to a standstill, causing the magnificent mountains to lose their luster. At the end of last year, Provincial Chairman Shen Honglie inspected various counties in southern Zhejiang and passed through the area. Recognizing that the scenic spots and historical sites of the Yandang Mountains urgently needed to be renovated, he instructed Yueqing County Magistrate Chen Jie to restore the Yandang Mountain Scenic Area Management Office as soon as possible. It is now known that the county magistrate, upon receiving the instructions, has begun preparing everything and has decided to restore the establishment of the Management Office on the first of next month.</p>

<h3>Picture of a Bleak Year-End in Jin City</h3>
<p>— Chengdu Dispatch by Our Special Correspondent Zhou Xueduan</p>
<p>Undercurrents Envelop Chengdu</p>
<p>Chengdu—Jin City—is a famous historical capital in Southwest China. Those who have visited Chengdu will surely cherish deep and beautiful memories. Most people believe that among modern Chinese cities, only Peiping, Chengdu, and Suzhou can represent typical Chinese culture. Peiping represents the desolate and tragic, magnificent, and expansive culture of Hebei. Suzhou represents the exquisite, ingenious, charming, and graceful beauty of Jiangnan. Chengdu combines both, maintaining beauty amidst desolation and profound majesty amidst charm. This is a consensus among those who have lingered in Chengdu.</p>
<p>The Chengdu Plain is the most affluent area of the "Land of Abundance." The people of Chengdu have long been accustomed to a life of ease, prosperity, and tranquility, cultivating habits of enjoyment, optimism, and leisure. The eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan, with all the baptism of gunfire, could not wash away the tranquil style of the Chengdu people. However, the "headwinds" and "inflation" brought about by post-war recovery, along with various unfavorable storms and winds, swept away all the peaceful and comfortable realities of Chengdu people's lives. As the year comes to an end, winter remains, the weather is freezing, and the north wind brings with it soaring prices, the collapse of industry and commerce, the bankruptcy of culture, and various dark clouds and chilling winds of social decay. The bleak end of the year in Jin City is no longer the era of "Jin City's silk and bamboo music, filling the air, half carried by the river breeze, half rising into the clouds." Chengdu in winter has been enveloped in the dark undercurrents and chilling fog of chaos and recession.</p>
<p>Three Winds of Winter</p>
<p>In winter, along with the Siberian cold current, the "inflation" and "headwinds" that simultaneously plague the entire country blow into Chengdu. Prices have been soaring like runaway horses in the past month. Gold, which leads prices, has broken through the 200,000 mark to 350,000, while rice has risen from 50,000 to 80,000. For a time, the market was in chaos, with prices rising in a straight line, the government powerless, and the common people terrified. It is said that this inflation is man-made. Speakers point out that gold bars are piling up in the vaults of major banks in Chengdu, and rice is piling up in granaries. However, those who speak, speak; those who inflate, inflate. Speculators are seen smiling broadly, while the poor are crying with hunger and cold. Fortunately, it is a world of shifting situations; the poor will starve to death from hunger and cold, no big deal!</p>
<p>Following closely on the heels of inflation, a series of social problems has arisen. These are the new and unique three winds of Chengdu—the "suicide wind," the "free eating wind," and the "theft wind." Low-salaried civil servants under the pressure of high prices, the unemployed, and the poor are forced by life's circumstances. The kindhearted choose the first path, while the strong are forced to take risks and embark on the latter two paths. The first, the "suicide wind," where suicide becomes a trend, is the most tragic social phenomenon and the most serious social problem. Since the beginning of winter, suicide cases in Chengdu society have been endless, almost several cases a day. The suicides are mostly petty civil servants, unemployed youths, and poor and sick common people. The reasons for suicide are difficulties in making a living, family disputes, marriage problems, etc. There have also been several cases of suicide due to landlords raising rents. This "suicide wind" has aroused social attention and concern. According to the analysis of sociologist Liu Shichuan, former president of Qilu University, this is another type of mental illness resulting from the long-term social chaos and extreme disappointment of people's hearts during the eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan. It cannot be stopped unless the social economy is fundamentally improved. "Free eating wind" is a special product of Chengdu society these days, also known as "eating from the rich," which means collectively eating without paying. In recent days, this trend has been fully displayed by unemployed soldiers. Around New Year's Day, hundreds of unemployed soldiers, responding to a call, went to major restaurants in groups to "eat for free." Restaurants frequented include Shengli and Rongsheng. This trend is now being suppressed by the Sichuan-Kangding Pacification Headquarters and may be slightly curbed. "Theft wind" is a common phenomenon in various cities. Since Chengdu entered winter, security has been strengthened, but the theft wind has become even more rampant. Statistics show that more than 600 theft cases were reported last month. For a provincial capital in Sichuan with a population of less than one million, this is a shocking figure.</p>
<p>Industry and Commerce on the Verge of Collapse</p>
<p>In the rush of the end of the year, all industries are withering. Accompanying "inflation" to Chengdu is the "headwind." This year, Chengdu's industry and commerce are suffering because Sichuan's rural areas have been overburdened for eight years, and the people's strength has been exhausted. In addition, last year, 114 counties in Sichuan Province suffered widespread drought and floods. Furthermore, they must bear the burden of requisitioning 9 million piculs of farmland grain this year. The rural economy is on the verge of total collapse, affecting the survival of the entire industry and commerce of Sichuan. At the same time, foreign goods are dumped, and local goods cannot survive. Chengdu's industry and commerce, which are just budding and growing, are like candles in the wind and frost on the tiles, in a precarious state.</p>
<p>First is Chengdu's industry. Chengdu is famous throughout the country for its handicrafts. For example, "Shu brocade," which is as famous as Xiang embroidery, was sold to Peiping and Tianjin in the north and shipped to India and Burma in the south before the war. It was especially loved and praised by the British and Americans. Currently, it is showing signs of decline. According to a survey after the beginning of winter, the number of weaving households in the city has decreased from more than 3,000 during the war to more than 2,000, and the number of weavers has decreased from more than 100,000 to more than 60,000. Sales are also particularly sluggish. In addition, among the new-style factories in Chengdu, there were 68 during the war, but only 44 remain this winter. The large-scale Shenxin Yarn Factory, Yuhua Yarn Factory, Fuhua Silk Factory, Fuchang Bristle Factory, Sichuan Machinery Company, etc., have become a trend, and the entire industry is sluggish.</p>
<p>Chengdu's commerce was originally the distribution center for Northwest Sichuan, serving as a hub for Shaanxi, Gansu, Kangding, and Tibet. After the war, due to the smooth flow of goods from Shanghai and Hong Kong, trade flourished for a time. Since the beginning of winter, due to fluctuations in commodity prices and the exhaustion of people's purchasing power, transactions have been at a standstill. At the same time, Shanghai's interest rates are very high, and idle funds are concentrated in Shanghai. As a result, Chengdu has experienced an unprecedented shortage of funds, the tightest it has been in ten years. Therefore, the "headwind" swept through, and a series of silver shops, money houses, and large stores closed down, disrupting the entire financial market and triggering a major financial crisis. The aftershocks are still lingering today.</p>
<p>With the assistance of provincial and municipal authorities, the business community of Chengdu barely made it through the solar New Year. However, the Lunar New Year, which follows closely behind, is imminent. This is a touchstone for the survival of all industries and businesses. People in the business community say, "Passing the Lunar New Year is like encountering the gates of hell!"</p>
<p>The Tragedy of Culture</p>
<p>These days are precisely when the "June-December War," which occurs twice a year in Sichuan's education sector, is about to unfold. Looking around at the current education and culture in Chengdu, it is truly heartrending! Chengdu was originally the cultural center of Southwest China. During the war, it once had ten famous universities and was known as the "cultural city" of the country. Newspapers and bookstores also flourished and prospered. But today, whether it is education, culture, schools, newspapers, or bookstores, they are all barely surviving in sorrow. Chengdu's culture is on a downward trend!</p>
<p>In Chengdu's education sector, the number of universities has been reduced from ten to six last year, and the current four universities can only accommodate more than 2,000 students per semester. The number of people who are unable to attend university is estimated to be more than 20,000. This is a serious problem for education. Moreover, the entire education funding in Sichuan Province is extremely inadequate. Last year, the education restoration fund was 800 million yuan, but the central government only allocated 450 million yuan, and the Finance Department only allocated 250 million yuan. The remaining amount was all deducted. Liu Mingyang, the Director of the Department of Education, has resigned in protest. Currently, the principals of all provincial and county middle schools in Sichuan are planning to resign en masse, and Chengdu's middle school students will also hold a large-scale parade to request increased education funding and independent management of education funds. For the sake of the young students' desire to learn and to help the youth who are unable to attend school, the current situation of education is heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Under the high prices, Chengdu's newspaper industry has felt unable to sustain itself. Last month, in order to increase the wages of its workers, the city's 19 newspapers jointly issued a painful appeal, expressing their heartfelt sorrow and requesting government loans, otherwise they would all cease publication. However, even if they were to obtain a small amount of loans, how could they alleviate the urgent needs of the future? Colleagues in the newspaper industry say that not only will the industry and commerce have to overcome difficulties this year, but the newspaper industry will also have to overcome difficulties. If the newspaper industry, which leads society, is in such a situation, how can one not be saddened by the future of Chengdu's culture!</p>
<p>Before the war, there were more than 260 new and used bookstores in Chengdu. Since the beginning of winter, only 140 remain. Most of them rely solely on low-level erotic novels to maintain their business, but even so, they are still on the verge of collapse.</p>
<p>This is the overall face of Chengdu's cultural circle. In the freezing winter, a tour of Chengdu's cultural garden reveals that it is filled with disappointment, sadness, and pain. The trend is degeneration and decline, and the bright future is obscured by dark undercurrents and chilling fog. Is Chengdu's culture, which was once brilliant, going to decline like this? The friends in Chengdu's cultural circle are not willing to accept this. They want to struggle in a difficult environment, and human effort will overcome fate. This is a ray of hope for the future of Chengdu's cultural circle.</p>
<p>In the long, cold winter, when will spring arrive? These days are the New Year's Day holiday. Chengdu's climate is bright, warm, and beautiful. People look up at the towering monument and the magnificent statue of the unknown hero. They flow through the quiet Wangjianglou Park and the beautiful Huaxi Dam. This ancient city, blessed with outstanding people, will eventually transition from the bleak end of the year to spring.</p>

<h3>The United States Must Maintain Necessary Armaments and Cooperate to Uphold Legitimate Peace: Byrnes Emphasizes This Point in His Last Public Speech Before Resignation; U.S. Control of Atomic Policy Unlikely to Change</h3>
<p>[Our Report] San Francisco, December 12 (Broadcast): Byrnes stated in his farewell speech in Cleveland that he believes that countries around the world can achieve a just peace through cooperative efforts. He urged the U.S. government to continue to implement its firm policy towards the Soviet Union. Byrnes said: "We must not assume that efforts for peace are hopeless simply because a method of reconciling opinions cannot be immediately found."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Cleveland, December 11] U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes delivered his last public speech before resigning at the International Politics Symposium co-hosted by Time Magazine and the Cleveland Council on World Affairs today. He expressed great confidence in completing the establishment of a just peace, but also argued that the United States must maintain the necessary military strength to fulfill its due responsibilities in the task of jointly maintaining legitimate peace. He pointed out that while force cannot create justice, in the current imperfect world, force and reason can both influence international decisions. Byrnes further emphasized the need to establish the proper place of law in international relations so that no country can force another to accept its views, and that neither the United States nor any other country should have the power to rule the world. The current power relations between the major powers prevent any one country from unilaterally ruling the world, and any attempt to do so would seriously disrupt the entire United Nations organization. Byrnes did not mention his resignation or Marshall's new position, and only made a vague criticism of the Soviet Union's attitude in the United Nations atomic energy debate.</p>
<p>Byrnes, referring to the Soviet Union's insistence on immediately discussing the entire issue of disarmament, said that the United States advocates first discussing the control of atomic weapons because this weapon is the most destructive. He believes that if an agreement can be reached on this matter, it will not be difficult to reach agreements on the control of other weapons and the reduction of armaments. Byrnes expressed dissatisfaction with the completion of the peace treaties with the former German satellite countries, believing that the time for discussing German and Austrian peace treaties will be greatly facilitated as a result. He believes that the progress made by the United States in diplomacy over the past year is due to the consistent foreign policy of the entire country. Byrnes also said that economic difficulties, famine, and disease are the main causes of political instability. Therefore, in order to maintain peace, the economic and social factors that induce aggressive warfare should be eliminated. The United States must continue to provide assistance to certain countries, and must do its best to support the International Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the U.S. Export-Import Bank, which specializes in foreign loans. The United States should also firmly implement its policy of mutual trade principles and the international trade organization charter it has proposed to expand U.S. and world trade, prevent the emergence of economic blocs, promote world prosperity, and thoroughly eliminate the factors of political instability.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, December 11] Observers with the right qualifications here recently stated that since Baruch, the U.S. representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, resigned, the U.S. atomic policy may be more "flexible," but it is unlikely to undergo large-scale changes. Baruch's achievements and the suggestions he put forward have been highly praised. Many people believe that Senator Austin's succession to Baruch's vacancy is well deserved. Although commentators have different views on the reasons for Baruch's resignation, most believe that Baruch's move was a reasonable step because since his mission has been accomplished, the responsibility for negotiations should naturally be borne by Zorin, the U.S. representative to the Security Council.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Corfu Channel Incident: Albania's Reply to Britain Published; Rejects British Accusations and Refuses Compensation and Apology</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, December 11] Cadogan, the British representative to the United Nations Security Council, sent a letter to the United Nations Secretariat yesterday, presenting the British accusation against Albania. Albania's reply to the British protest was also included in the letter. The content of the reply was published for the first time. Cadogan's letter stated that the British government believes that Albania's reply is completely unsatisfactory, so the British government instructed it to submit the dispute to the Security Council as soon as possible in accordance with Article 35 of the United Nations Charter. The Albanian reply was delivered to British Ambassador to Yugoslavia, Peirse, on December 21, in which it expressed deep regret over the incident in October in which two British destroyers struck mines in the Corfu Channel, resulting in the deaths of 44 sailors. However, at the same time, it solemnly refuted the accusations made by the British protest letter, pointing out that the accusations are inconsistent with the Albanian people's repeated expressions of peaceful aspirations and the Albanian government's friendly policy towards Britain or other nations. It also stated that it is regrettable that the British government's policy towards Albania has not always been guided by peaceful purposes. For example, the British government supports the unreasonable demands of Greek imperialist elements for a part of Albanian territory. Britain's firm opposition to Albania, which is also an allied country, joining the United Nations organization, the British government's unfriendly attitude towards Albania in discussions on peace treaties, and the British government's refusal to establish normal diplomatic relations with the Albanian government all indicate Britain's unfriendliness towards Albania. Even worse, Britain has directly violated Albanian sovereignty. For example, two British warships entered Albanian territorial waters in May 1946 without permission. A similar incident occurred on December 22. On October 23, British aircraft invaded Albania again. On November 12, a British fleet formed in a combat formation passed along the Albanian south coast. The next day, British warships fired machine guns into the air outside Saranda. The Albanian government had previously appealed to the United Nations for attention to these "illegal acts." In the incident on October 22, in which two British warships were injured, the British warships' passage through the northern Corfu Channel seriously violated the principle of good faith passage. Regarding the British accusation that Albania laid mines in the Corfu Channel, knew that other countries had laid mines there, or knew that there were mines there, it is completely unfounded and slanders the peaceful will of the Albanian government and people. The Albanian government believes that if this matter is indeed malicious, it must have been done by someone who intended to undermine friendly relations between Britain and Albania. The Albanian government can present the following facts to support this, that is, Greek and other countries' ships often intrude into Albanian southern territorial waters without permission. The Albanian government's reply continued to say that the Albanian government's suggestion to send a mixed committee to investigate the matter was entirely sincere, with the purpose of resolving the matter in a spirit of friendly cooperation. Finally, the Albanian reply stated that since the points pointed out by the British government are completely unfounded, it cannot accept the request to compensate the families of the deceased British crew members or apologize to Britain.</p>
<h3>The United States Will Adopt a New Policy in the Far East to Prevent the Continued Spread of Communism; It Will Spend $2 Billion Annually on Relief</h3>
<p>[Our Special Correspondent, Washington, December 12] The famous American news magazine "World Report" stated that the United States will take practical steps to prevent the spread of communism in countries outside the United States. It is said that the rampant communism in the East has aroused great attention from the U.S. authorities. The new Congress will give it careful consideration. In China, Korea, and Japan, the deterioration of the economic situation has further facilitated the development of communism, threatening true democracy. Currently, the United States has three options: (1) the United States withdraws from Europe and Asia; (2) continues its current policy; (3) adopts a new policy. Informed sources say that the United States will adopt a third new policy, providing a large amount of materials and food to countries in need of relief. In this regard, the United States will spend $2 billion annually.</p>
<h3>Lloyd George's Foresight: U.S. Releases Secret Files</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, December 11, United Press] The U.S. State Department today released secret files regarding the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, which showed that British Prime Minister Lloyd George warned U.S. President Wilson and French Premier Clemenceau at the time that after the Great War, the Soviet Union would rise as a powerful and ambitious country, creating Slavic nation-states, and may eventually control 160 million people in the world. According to a part of the documents, after World War I, British and American politicians seemed to be as concerned about the rapid growth of communism as they are today, but their opinions differed on what threat the Bolshevik Soviet Union would pose to the world. Wilson believed that Lloyd George was overly pessimistic about the threat of the Soviet Union and overly optimistic about the Soviet Union's ability to develop its socialist economy.</p>
<h3>Welles Analyzes the Far East Situation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, December 12, United Press] Former U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles broadcast that the British and Dutch governments' decision to grant independence to India and Burma and autonomy to Indonesia is extremely bright when looking at the overall situation. In the past few months, the long and arduous civil war in China is more likely to increase than to be eliminated. The key to peace in East Asia lies in the final overall understanding between Washington and Moscow. Before this understanding is reached, there is no reason to expect improvement.</p>
<h3>Norway Will Reply to the Soviet Note; Swedish Circles Express Concern</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Norwegian Capital, December 11] Regarding the Soviet note to the Norwegian government requesting the revision of the 1920 Spitsbergen Treaty, a radio station here reported that the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs will submit a reply within a few days.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Swedish Capital, December 11] It is rumored that the Soviet Union requested the revision of the international treaty concluded in 1920, in which Norway ceded the Spitsbergen Islands (located in the Arctic Ocean north of Norway) to the Soviet Union as a military base. All Swedish newspapers are paying close attention to this matter. "Kungen Times" stated: "Everyone has different ideas about Spitsbergen. The countries that signed the 1920 treaty, except for Italy and Japan, are all members of the United Nations. Why not let the United Nations resolve this matter?"</p>
<h3>Indonesian Cabinet Established; Chinese Xie Guochang Appointed Minister of Justice</h3>

<h3>Marshal Montgomery Returns to London after Completing Mission to Moscow - Soviet Suspicion of Anglo-American Military Cooperation Eliminated</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, November 11] Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Montgomery, having completed his five-day visit to Moscow, returned by plane today and went directly to the War Office. The British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Roberts, also returned on Montgomery's special plane to report to the Foreign Office on the success of Montgomery's visit. Britain and the Soviet Union originally signed a twenty-year military alliance treaty in 1942. Foreign Secretary Bevin suggested extending it for fifty years, but the Soviet Union did not agree. Montgomery's visit this time has greatly reduced Soviet suspicions of Anglo-American military cooperation. The United States is pleased to hear that the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union are developing a closer military relationship. Agence France-Presse reports that after Montgomery returned to London, he told reporters: "My meeting with Marshal Stalin went very well. Marshal Stalin is as healthy as ever. I am very satisfied with this trip, and I am particularly impressed with the Soviet Red Army."</p>

<h3>International Emergency Food Council Announces Rice Allocation for First Half of Year - China to Receive 245,000 Tons</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, November 11] The International Emergency Food Council announced today the amount of rice allocated to various countries for the first half of 1947, totaling 1,682,000 tons, of which China will receive 245,000 tons, India 410,000 tons, Malaya 225,000 tons, Ceylon 200,000 tons, the Dutch East Indies 100,000 tons, and the Philippines 95,000 tons. The Food Council pointed out that due to the lack of rice supply sources, the approved allocation is less than half of the amount requested by each country. The largest rice exporting country during the same period is Burma, with 800,000 tons, followed by Siam. In addition to supplying 375,000 tons of white rice to China, Siamese merchants are also willing to supply another 25,000 tons of white rice to China.</p>

<h3>Tumultuous Political Situation in Japan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, November 12] The Yoshida Cabinet, which emerged on May 22nd last year with the aim of revitalizing Japan, appears to be on the verge of resigning en masse in the middle of this week, as an initial step toward expanding its political base and regaining power. It is rumored that Yoshida himself believes that this measure is the best way to promote the national revival of Japan. It is said that the new reorganized cabinet will still be led by Yoshida and his predecessor Shidehara, and its lineup will include several members of the Social Democratic Party, compromising with the left wing, but policy concessions will be limited, only to gain the favor of certain factions of the labor political organizations under the leadership of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Communist Party that are designated as "extreme reactionaries." Although various left-wing groups are taking advantage of this to publicize and mobilize all their forces to launch labor strikes in Japan, which will greatly hinder Japan's post-war production.</p>

<h3>Japan's Reparations Problem (Part II)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper in Tokyo, Chuan Junyi</p>
<p>Since the release of the Pauley final report, the Japanese government has held cabinet meetings every day to discuss countermeasures. It is said that the Japanese government's countermeasures hope to ease the restrictions on industrial productivity and raise it to the level of 1937, when the Sino-Japanese War broke out. It is said that the plan hopes to maintain the standard of living of the Japanese people at the level of 1930. If this level can be maintained, it will still be necessary to import 3 billion yen worth of necessities such as food, clothing raw materials, petroleum rubber, etc. every year, while the export capacity, such as raw silk and other items, is only 1.1 billion yen. The difference is still less than 2 billion, which must be compensated by importing raw materials and semi-finished products for processing and then exporting them. Therefore, industrial production capacity must be maintained at the level of 1937.</p>
<p>Impact of Implementing Reparations on Japan</p>
<p>If, according to the Pauley plan, all 100,000 items of reparations are removed, and calculated with a population of 80 million, what will be the size of Japan's economy in a few years? The views of influential people here on this issue are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) If it is necessary to maintain the living standard of 1930, calculated at the price level of 1936, it will be necessary to import 830 million yen worth of food, 1.05 billion yen worth of clothing, and 1.52 billion yen worth of industrial raw materials and other items, totaling approximately 3.4 billion yen. However, Japan must rely on foreign merchant ships to import these items, and the freight is approximately 200 million yen, so the import amount will reach 3.5 billion yen.</p>
<p>(2) The goods exchanged for this 3.5 billion yen are 1.1 billion yen worth of iron and fiber products, 450 million yen worth of machinery and metal products, 300 million yen worth of chemical products and medicines, and 850 million yen worth of raw silk, aquatic products, ceramics, glassware, and other items. Among them, only 800 million yen worth of raw silk and glassware can be produced with domestic raw materials, and the raw materials for all other items must be imported from abroad.</p>
<p>(3) In addition to 9 million spindles for textile machines (including domestic consumption), a minimum amount of processing equipment is also necessary for other sectors such as ironmaking, machinery, and chemical industries. However, because basic industries such as ferrous and non-ferrous metals and caustic soda have been restricted, these products must be imported in large quantities. A portion of the consumption of artificial ivory and tar products, alcohol, and medicines must also be imported from abroad.</p>
<p>The limit on textile machines is two-thirds of the required amount, and chemical products, machinery, and metal products will also be restricted. The complete removal of the steel ball industry, tar industry, alcohol industry, and artificial ivory industry will inevitably cause considerable difficulties for the mechanical and chemical industries.</p>
<p>After the reparations plan is implemented, the scale of industry will inevitably be restricted, and the export sector will also be limited. Therefore, the population that the industrial sector can support will inevitably shrink, and a considerable number of unemployed people will occur. If the population is calculated at 80 million, the maximum number of people that agricultural income can absorb in the future will be no more than 15 million. If the number of employed people in the 80 million population is calculated at 36.8 million, 5 million people will be absorbed by commerce, 5.8 million people will be employed in other sectors, and 10 million people will remain, who should be absorbed by the industrial sector.</p>
<p>Washington Will Make the Final Decision</p>
<p>Washington has not yet made a concrete decision on Pauley's final report on reparations for Japan. It is currently being revised by various experts. Pauley once limited Japan's industrial level to the level between 1926 and 1930, and it seems possible to revise it to the level between 1928 and 1934. The Allied Supreme Commander's Headquarters here has repeatedly requested Washington to adopt a lenient policy regarding reparations for Japan. The Japanese government's proposal to maintain the economic level of 1930 has been submitted to the General Headquarters for forwarding to Washington. Regarding the General Headquarters' attitude towards the issue of reparations for Japan, officials on that side stated: (1) They have made every effort to advocate establishing a policy that is sufficient to allow Japanese industry to continue to exist. (2) The General Headquarters is very familiar with all issues and Japan's efforts for economic reconstruction. (3) The reparations policy for Japan was determined in the past, but the situation has changed since then, so it should be revised. Many such changes have occurred recently, especially the changes that have occurred in the Japanese industry.</p>
<p>How to Dispose of the Chinese Portion</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to say a word about the disposal of the portion of reparations from Japan that China should receive. It is said that out of the 12 million tons of reparations materials, China can receive 3.6 million tons. The issues of removal, transportation, and the technical issues of resuming work after repatriation are all worthy of study. Certain chemical industries, such as the caustic soda industry, cannot be re-established after removal. There are already several precedents in Japan itself. During the war, some factories were evacuated from Nagoya to Nagano to avoid air raids, and the loss of equipment reached nearly half. Even if all technical and transportation issues are resolved, and they can be immediately installed and resumed work after being moved back, it is still a question whether the products can compete with the products of other advanced countries with lower prices and better quality under the current high production cost situation. Except for certain important industries where the technical, transportation, and installation restoration issues can be resolved by themselves, it is also not unworthy of careful consideration to temporarily leave certain industries in Japan and use Japanese technology and cheap labor to continue operations under strict supervision. Otherwise, it will still evolve into the phenomenon of stopping work upon receipt, which is not only a loss for China itself, but also a waste of the overall productive capacity of East Asia.</p>

<h3>Heated Discussion on Eating Out - Threshold for Taxing Banquets Decided to be Changed to 5,000 Yuan - Opinions Divided on Classification Issue, No Result Reached - General Assembly Continues Discussion This Morning</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Municipal Council held its sixth meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss five financial proposals, among which the issue of the threshold for levying banquet taxes and the levy of different taxes for restaurants classified into A and B categories caused heated debate, lasting for two hours. As a result, the threshold for banquet taxes was passed at 5,000 yuan through voting, but the issue of classification remained unresolved. Subsequently, four opinions were proposed, but none received a majority of votes through voting, and the general assembly will continue the discussion this morning. The four opinions are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Threshold Issue: The original threshold was 3,000 yuan, but the Finance Committee resolved to change it to 5,000 yuan. Zhou Lianze proposed raising the threshold from 5,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan, which was seconded by several councilors, but some other councilors still insisted on maintaining 5,000 yuan, and the majority passed.</p>
<p>(2) Classification Issue: Director of the Finance Bureau Gu Chunfan said: According to the central government's regulations, a banquet tax is levied on each table with a fixed price. If the restaurant side disputes this, arguing that Western food does not refer to each table, but rather each customer, and therefore should not be taxed, and that Chinese food must have ten people and cost more than 100,000 yuan to be considered a "table," then the taxes collected by the city government will be very few, so it is necessary to establish a method. If the tax law does not have accurate regulations, it is impossible to prevent leakage or embezzlement. The current standard set by the city government is: Any restaurant whose normal business mostly exceeds 25,000 yuan each time will be classified as A grade, and a banquet tax of 20% will be levied; any restaurant whose business is mostly below 25,000 yuan each time will be classified as B grade, and a tax of 10% will be levied. However, the bureau does not impose rigid regulations and must also consider whether the restaurant's prices are cheap. If there are B-grade restaurants with pricing standards similar to A-grade restaurants, they will still be classified as A grade. Conversely, A-grade restaurants with low prices can be classified as B grade. The purpose of this is to benefit the citizens.</p>
<p>Councilors expressed different opinions on this case: Zhu Wende, Lu Yinchu, Fei Shusheng, Lu Shidao, Wu Zhengjue, and others did not approve of grading, believing it to be unreasonable and unfair. Wu Zhengjue also said that the central government did not stipulate grading, and this case should not be discussed at all. Discussing it would be illegal. The general assembly voted on whether to shelve the case, but the majority did not approve. Lu Shidao said that this case violates the central government's laws and regulations. It should not be graded now, and the discussion should be postponed until the central government amends the laws and regulations.</p>
<p>Some People Eat the Decoration, Tao Baichuan Advocates Grading</p>
<p>However, Tao Baichuan advocated grading, believing that many people in the world are willing to spend more money. They eat the decoration, or the food is superior, or the chef has a good reputation, and they do not care about paying more taxes. In fact, many large restaurants are not affected by high taxes and still make money. Qu Cheng also agreed that there should be grades, believing that many wealthy people are willing to go to A-grade restaurants and pay more. Let them go, otherwise they will feel sorry for their guests when they invite them!</p>
<p>Deputy Speaker Xu Jiqing also said that the issue of eating out must be discussed in detail and agreed to grading because citizens have different economic strengths. Li Wenjie proposed a compromise, drawing the attention of colleagues, advocating grading, but with attached conditions, that is, if A-grade operators have less than 25,000 yuan per transaction, they should be taxed according to the B-grade standard, that is, at 10%.</p>
<p>As a result, four opinions were put to a vote: (1) Agree to A and B grades, (2) Disagree to grading, (3) According to Councilor Li's opinion, that is, A-grade operators with less than 25,000 yuan will be taxed at 10%, (4) According to Councilor Lu's proposal, no grading will be done currently, and a decision will be made after the central government amends the laws and regulations. As a result, each opinion did not receive a majority, and the general assembly could not make a decision and will continue the discussion today.</p>
<h3>Clubs Do Not Pay Taxes - Director Claims It Is Due to Some Kind of Relationship</h3>
<p>When Wu Zhengjue inquired as to why the New Life Club was not taxed, and what the tax situation was for refreshments, Director Gu replied: There are more than just the New Life Club in this city that do not pay taxes. Due to some kind of relationship, the Finance Bureau's authority cannot reach them, but it has repeatedly contacted the club authorities to pay taxes. According to the old tax law, refreshments that are considered luxury items are all taxable, but according to the central government's new tax law, they do not need to be taxed. This point can also be discussed and decided by the Municipal Council. Deputy Speaker Xu made a supplementary statement: In the former concession era, all foreign clubs did not pay taxes because many clubs were indeed places for three or five private individuals to rest, but now clubs have become public places, so he advocated that all clubs, regardless of Chinese or foreign, should be taxed as restaurants.</p>
<h3>Startled Several Times in One Night - People of All Kinds in Hotels Investigated Rooms - Government Should Pay Attention to the Safety and Tranquility of Travelers - Resolution to Levy Hotel Tax at 5%</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The case of "The current hotel tax increases the burden on travelers, hinders hotel business, and is not based on law. It is proposed to send a letter to the city government to stop collecting it immediately to alleviate the people's difficulties," which was reviewed by the Finance Committee of the Municipal Council, was also presented to the general assembly yesterday for lengthy discussion. Speaker Pan retired from the speaker's seat and formally expressed his opinion for the first time: Although the hotel tax is collected at 5%, which is a very small amount, the hotel industry representatives have repeatedly petitioned the Municipal Council, stating their difficulties, and the business is indeed slow. This is because some travelers, relying on special forces, refuse to pay the tax, forcing the hotel authorities to pay on their behalf. Some hotels even pay millions of yuan on their behalf. Hotels became a deformed business during the enemy and puppet period, becoming the main base for illegal activities such as smoking and gambling, so it was appropriate to collect special taxes. However, it is worth everyone's attention whether the hotel industry should be regarded as a special business now. There are two things that hotels feel most painful about: (1) The accounting staff of general hotels cannot control the waiters. After offending the travelers, the hotel owners have no power to manage them, and the waiters take charge. Does the government have a way to help solve this problem? (2) In terms of inspection, there are people in uniform, people in plain clothes, and inexplicably personnel in the hotels every day, at no fixed time, no fixed period, and no fixed shift, checking the guests' rooms late at night. For example, if a traveler is drinking alcohol in the room by himself, the inspectors will say that this is an illegal act, and say, "If you want to drink, you can go to Wang Baohe"! Situations like this treat the common people as non-human beings, so unless absolutely necessary, no one dares to come as a traveler. This shows that politics needs to be rectified from the bottom up. In fact, if the travelers' lives are stable, they are willing to pay more taxes, so I am making this appeal on their behalf. While the government collects taxes, it must also consider the people's suffering.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu stood up and declared that the city government has indeed thought about the safety and tranquility of travelers and is trying to improve it, but (1) in terms of inspection, there are not as many as six types. The Garrison Command has been asked to jointly inspect with the police station once. In the former concession era, hotels completely became the main base for smoking and gambling, and the atmosphere was corrupted, but now it is still necessary to maintain good social customs, and the city government and everyone should be responsible. (2) The owners and waiters are also labor-management disputes. I have met with both labor and management sides once each, and I have earnestly warned the labor side that their request for year-end bonuses this time is not based on precedent, and I have also told the labor side not to insist. The city government also deeply understands and sympathizes with the hotel's situation of paying taxes on behalf of the guests. However, suffering is one issue, and taxes are another issue. We will do our best to accept opinions and improve on the issue of suffering. As for the central government's regulations, it will be extremely troublesome for our city to make changes again in the future, so it is better to collect taxes according to the central government's regulations. Subsequently, councilors expressed their opinions. Tao Baichuan advocated supporting the central government's laws and regulations. If the central government revises the 5% to 10%, it should also be supported because, for the sake of protecting the interests of the city's citizens, the taxes that should be levied on foreign travelers can be levied, otherwise it will increase the burden on the city's citizens. Luo Qinghua advocated that there must be a numerical regulation, limited to 5%. He cannot agree with protecting the interests of the city's citizens at the expense of increasing the burden on foreign guests. To prosper Shanghai, foreign guests must be welcomed, and moreover, there are also many citizens of this city living in hotels. Shao Yongsheng also said that many civil servants live in hotels, and they are also citizens of this city. Why must their burden be increased? As a result, this case was passed by a majority of the general assembly, amended according to Shao Yongsheng's opinion, and resolved that "taxes should be collected at 5%".</p>
<h3>Land and Business Taxes Decided to Be Assigned to Local Governments</h3>
<p>The general assembly also passed three other cases yesterday: (1) Telegraphing the central government to allocate property rental income tax and stamp tax. (2) Telegraphing the central government to assign all land and business tax revenues to local governments. (3) In order to continue raising 500 million yuan for the 32nd-year Allied Victory Public Bonds as ordered, in addition to increasing and supplementing the allocation, the city government plans to separately solicit the remaining 100 million yuan and assign it to the district offices to be responsible for soliciting contributions in order to complete the task quickly.</p>
<h3>Budget Cannot Be Cleared - Adjournment Without End</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The agenda of the second session of the second Municipal Council was originally scheduled to hold a memorial week this morning, discuss the city's 36th-year budget, and then adjourn. It is now because there are too many cases to be discussed and cannot be completed as scheduled, so the discussion on tax and financial proposals will continue this morning. At the same time, the issue of whether to postpone the general assembly will also be put to a public vote at the general assembly today.</p>
<h3>Qian Jianqiu Hosts Women's Circle - Reports on the Experience of Attending the National Congress - Successful Efforts to Fight for Rights</h3>
<p>Ms. Qian Jianqiu, Director of the Municipal Women's Association and Chairperson of the Women's Movement Committee, held a tea party at the Police Club on Aima Road yesterday at 3:00 PM to host the heads of various women's organizations in the city, report on the situation of attending the National Congress, and the efforts of all the women representatives to fight for the constitutional provisions. Representatives from the Shanghai Deyu Women's Advancement Association, the Chinese Women's Alliance, Women's Vocational Education, Law, Medicine, Labor, Sports, Middle School Students, University Students, and Family institutions, the Chinese Women's Society, the Chinese Women's Reform Association, and the Female Youth Group of the Three People's Principles Youth League attended. In addition, representatives from various women's circles in the city, such as Zhang Xiangwen, Fang Yingda, Zhu Suman, Wu Ruohua, Chen Zhenquan, Shen Muzhen, Yu Shuming, Xie Jinyuan's wife, Wang Jiazhen, Wang Peizhen, Jia Guanqing, Yan Weiru, Qiu Xisheng, Su Zufie, and Ling Qi, also attended, gathering together for a total of more than 50 people. Qian gave a speech saying: The constitution formulated by this National Congress will become the most progressive constitution in the world regarding the protection of women's right to participate in politics. Although the constitutions of Britain, the United States, and various European countries have not made such concrete provisions for women's political rights, I firmly believe that the demands put forward by Chinese women at this conference are the common aspirations of women around the world because, so far, women in various countries have not achieved true equality in politics, so the success of Chinese women in obtaining this in the constitution is truly gratifying. The improvement of women's status is not only about fighting for the right to participate in politics, but the failure to develop the right to participate in politics is the main obstacle to women's advancement. At this National Congress, Madame Chiang's efforts to fight for women's rights are truly commendable. The women's proposal was passed by the conference, which stipulates that the quota for women in various elections in the future will be 20%, and the method of producing representatives to the National Congress also designates representatives to be elected by women's organizations. In addition, the quota for women in the Legislative Yuan will also be stipulated.</p>
<h3>Morning Review Meeting Discusses Central Work; Summaries of Bureau Plans Reviewed and Revised</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The special committee of the Municipal Council for reviewing the municipal government's central work plan for the 36th year and the summary report on the administration from September to November last year held a meeting at the Municipal Council site in Fuming Village yesterday morning. Representatives from all bureaus attended. During the meeting, Tao Baichuan stated: "The budget is based on the central work. If the central work is uncertain, the budget cannot be certain. The work plan and the budget prepared by the municipal government this time are not closely coordinated and appear to be disconnected. It is regrettable that the council did not submit this central work plan to various groups for review in advance. Now that the group review meetings have come to an end, it is impossible to hold them again. Therefore, nineteen people have been designated to form this committee for review. Since many of them have specialized knowledge, it is feared that they will not be able to handle it, but since they have been ordered, they will do their best." It was unanimously agreed not to discuss the implementation methods and completion deadlines of the plan. The summary of the plan was reviewed and revised.</p>
<p>(1) Civil Affairs: Rectifying the Baojia system and household registration are the central tasks for the 36th year, as designated by the Executive Yuan. Promoting clean areas is also an important task.</p>
<p>(2) Police Affairs: 1. Improve the quality of the police and strengthen police training. 2. Strengthen fire-fighting equipment. (The section on increasing police officers by 6,000 is temporarily suspended. If necessary, a supplementary budget will be requested.)</p>
<p>(3) Social Affairs: 1. Suppress commodity prices. 2. Promote cooperative undertakings. 3. Strengthen relief institutions. 4. Strive for labor-management cooperation to increase production. (Among them, the third item, relief institutions, is under the management of the fourth department of the Social Affairs Bureau, so the Municipal Relief Institute in the budget will be abolished to save funds.)</p>
<p>(4) Education: 1. Increase the number of national schools and national education classes. (The number of national education classes in the budget will be appropriately reduced to be used for establishing more national schools.) 2. Increase the number of public schools, supplementary schools, and vocational schools. Regarding the original plan to raise educational funds and promote private schooling, the Education Bureau has automatically withdrawn and postponed it because it is not easy to raise funds under the current economic downturn.</p>
<p>(5) Finance: The financial work plan for the city in the 36th year, in addition to continuing the important tasks of the 35th year, such as simplifying audit procedures and eliminating embezzlement, should increase taxes by eight points, especially by collecting city-wide property taxes and saving unnecessary expenses as the central task.</p>
<p>(6) Public Works: 1. Develop suburban transportation. 2. Reduce flooding. 3. Restore Nanshi and Zhabei. 4. Relieve housing shortages. 5. Urban planning. (The public works bureau's budget for this year's project to connect the north and south banks of the Suzhou Creek, flood prevention project, and Pudong Avenue expansion project was originally 50.3 billion, but due to insufficient funds, 21.8 billion has been reduced, so only a portion can be done this year. The case will be discussed separately.)</p>
<p>(7) Public Utilities: 1. Increase power and strengthen public utilities. 2. Improve wharf warehouses. 3. Add street lights. 4. Solve the water shortage in western Shanghai (because the municipal government has already submitted a special project, it will be left to the general meeting for discussion). 5. Strengthen public transportation.</p>
<p>(8) Land Administration: 1. Organize maps and records. 2. Land registration. 3. Determine land prices. 4. Promote land value tax.</p>
<p>(9) Health: 1. Promote health care. 2. Improve environmental sanitation.</p>
<p>Due to lack of time, the review of the administrative situation report was not held yesterday. It was agreed that the conveners of the group, Wang Jian'e, Tao Baichuan, and Fu Rulin, together with Zhu Wende, Tong Xingbai, and Wu Zhengzhao, would be jointly responsible for compiling a written report on the review opinions and submitting it to the general meeting today.</p>

<h3>City Party Headquarters Hosts Banquet for All Councilors</h3>
<p>Fang, the director of the Shanghai City Party Headquarters, hosted a banquet for all municipal councilors at the Jin Gu Hotel at 7 p.m. yesterday, with more than 160 people attending. During the banquet, Director Fang delivered a speech, stating: "Everyone has worked very hard these past few days to discuss the city's political measures in the future. The City Party Headquarters serves the people, and today we have prepared a modest meal to express our respect for the representatives of the people. At the same time, we hope that you will give more guidance to the Party Headquarters, which serves the people. Democratic politics is just beginning, and everything must demonstrate a democratic style. This time, you have highly expressed public opinion in the Municipal Council and also fully understood the government's democratic political style." Deputy Minister Xu then delivered a thank-you speech on behalf of the attendees. After the speech, the guests and hosts raised their glasses to each other's health, and the atmosphere was warm and harmonious. The banquet ended happily around 9 p.m.</p>
<h3>Dismissal of Art Teachers No Longer Reconsidered; Students Merged into Xinlu Normal School</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Education Committee of the Municipal Council held its first temporary meeting yesterday morning to continue reviewing proposals: (1) Proposal to request the municipal government to establish schools for children of employees of autonomous agencies. Review opinion: The admission of children of employees of autonomous agencies should follow the example of children of public educators, allowing free admission without the need to establish special schools. (2) Telegram to the central government to quickly allocate the remaining enemy-puppet properties in the city area after the auction by the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau to the city's education funds. Review opinion: 1. Revise the reason for the original proposal, adding the four characters "cultural construction" under the two characters "education." 2. The committee will telegraph the Chairman of the National Government to approve the allocation. 3. Request the municipal government to earnestly carry out the plan. (3) Request for reconsideration of the case of dismissing the Municipal Art and Health Normal School. Review opinion: It was found that three of the four proposers of the original proposal and thirty-six of the supporters have applied to withdraw the case because "Director Gu reported that the students of the school have been merged into Xinlu Normal School, which does not hinder the cultivation of art teachers." Also, according to Article 85 of the Preliminary of People's Rights, "a resolution that has already been implemented shall naturally not be reconsidered," it is proposed that reconsideration should not be requested.</p>
<h3>Rather Be an Unfilial Son Than a Faithless Man? Shanghai University Graduate Commits Suicide by Poison</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The youth, Ge Wenjun, twenty-five years old, from Ningbo, lived at No. 9, Siming Village, Zhongzheng Middle Road. He graduated from Shanghai University in the 33rd year of the Republic and later worked at the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau. In June of last summer, he changed to the Maoheng Import and Export Company at No. 208, HSBC Building, the Bund, as an accountant. He usually left early and returned late, spending his leisure time reading newspapers or teasing his younger siblings. Unexpectedly, he suddenly did not return home one night (the 10th). The next morning, his father, Ge Hongzhong (who worked at No. 99 Youdou Company), received the news and called the company to inquire, learning that Wenjun had not yet arrived at the company to work. He then called home to inquire, and his family said that Wenjun had returned home to sleep around 10 a.m. His father was at work at the time and did not have time to return home to inquire about the reason for staying out. When he returned home at 10 p.m., he went to Wenjun's room (the attic) to check and saw that Wenjun's face was pale and he was in a dying state. He also saw four empty bottles of sleeping pills on the table, knowing that it was suicide. He immediately called the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road and summoned an ambulance to the hospital for treatment, but due to excessive poisoning, it was too late to save him, and he died shortly afterward.</p>
<p>After the hospital reported to the Jing'an Temple Sub-bureau, Inspector Meng Ruisheng and police officer Zhang Shouxin were ordered to go to his home to investigate and seized three suicide notes: (1) to his parents, (2) a suicide confession, and (3) a letter to his friend Gong Jialong. The writing in the suicide notes was smooth. The main points were: "I have received your loving care and upbringing, and I have been thinking for many years about your hard work and exhaustion for me. I have not yet repaid your kindness, and I am unfilial to end my life so lightly. I have always been loved and cherished, and I will inevitably grieve constantly when suddenly encountering this change. It is difficult to immediately release the love of parents for their children, but the great number is predetermined, and life and death are destined. It can also be seen that one reaps what one sows. The dead are gone, and the living should cherish themselves. I hope you will be optimistic and not be too sad, so as not to damage your health."</p>
<h3>Tender and Touching Letter</h3>
<p>His confession stated: "According to the lunar calendar, I am already twenty-five years old. The end of the year is approaching, and I will add another year, but I have decided to die before the age of twenty-five. This is when the chart of life reaches its peak, and it is time to go back."</p>
<p>Why commit suicide? Heartbreak? No! Unemployment? No! I have a decent job. Economic pressure? Also no! I have enough income to maintain my personal livelihood every month. Dying for fear of crime? No! I have never committed any crimes, and I have a clear conscience. What is the real reason? To put it bluntly, "I am tired of traveling in this world and want to go to another paradise."</p>
<p>There is another thing I want to ask you to do. On the night of my death next year, offer a plum blossom (not a bouquet) in my room. Discard the flower the next day. Once is enough, and you don't need to do it again the second year. Because this plum blossom has another symbol. If there is no soul after death, then I am asking you to worship another person on my behalf. This is the third anniversary that I cannot complete because I will not be able to visit her grave in the third year. If there really is a soul, we will eventually meet one day in heaven.</p>
<p>There is also a list of remaining belongings listed below and placed in the iron box in the drawer by the wall, opened with key number 100, including more than one million in cash, several US dollars, a Simm wristwatch, and a gold ring.</p>
<p>According to the police officer in charge of the case, after investigation, it was learned that Ge Wenjun's death was actually a suicide for love. He had a lover, and their feelings were very deep, but due to the disagreement of their parents, he committed suicide. Ge vowed not to marry another woman, and this sudden suicide was still for this reason. The so-called "plum blossom" in the suicide note refers to her.</p>
<h3>Fire on Yingshi Road</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Xieyu Coal Briquette Factory on Yingshi Road, Hefei Road, caught fire at 4 p.m. yesterday due to the fire spreading from the baking of coal briquettes.

<h3>Maid Tragically Strangled to Death; Where Did the Strange Visitor Come From Last Night?</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Recently, murder cases have occurred frequently in the city. Yesterday, another maid, Li Ma, 26 years old, from Gaoyou, was strangled to death with hemp rope at No. 14, Lane 68, Shunchang Road (i.e., Yuqing Fang). Yesterday morning, because the deceased had not gotten up, the owner, Jiang Yaocai (manager of Yunji Paper Company), ordered the rickshaw driver, A Er, to go to her sleeping place in the small room behind the parlor downstairs to check. He saw her lying on the bed, half-naked, with several hemp ropes tied around her neck. He felt her and found that she was already dead. He was shocked and immediately reported to the Taishan Police Sub-bureau. Inspector Zhang Jiashi was dispatched, along with police officers Hao Wende and Zhang Dazhen, to investigate. The body was transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Tang for an autopsy. It was learned that the deceased was introduced by the rickshaw driver, A Er, last month. Her husband's name is Li Youde, who is currently a manager in a public toilet in Hongkou. The couple's relationship was not good. The maid's work was usually quite diligent. The day before yesterday evening, a fellow villager, someone named Jia, came to talk to her and left shortly afterward. There was some argument in the conversation. Around 8 p.m., another person came and entered the room with the deceased and soon left. Whether the case is a jealous murder is still under investigation by the police.</p>
<h3>Petitions Come in a Steady Stream; Assembly Overwhelmed</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Yesterday, citizen groups went to the Municipal Council to petition on four occasions: 1. Twenty-four households on Huashan Road, because the Public Works Bureau wanted to connect the English and French tramways to facilitate north-south traffic, and will demolish houses, specially formed a petition group to preserve houses, went to the assembly yesterday afternoon, fifty men, women, old and young, each holding a flag, and holding incense sticks, kneeling in front of the assembly hall. Five councilors including Zhu Wenqi and the directors of the Land Administration Bureau and the Public Works Bureau received them. The representatives requested three points: (1) Please allow a temporary delay in demolition, (2) Pay compensation fees generously, (3) The municipal government should consider whether to demolish less and narrow the sidewalks to supplement. After discussion between the councilors and the directors, a delay in demolition was approved, or the deadline could be extended to the end of February, but the representatives were still dissatisfied, and the authorities agreed to consider it further.</p>
<p>2. The entire student body of the Municipal Experimental Public School, about 400 people, went to the assembly to request: (1) Do not change the school name and nature of the school, (2) Popularize public education throughout the city, and expand the experimental public school to accommodate more out-of-school people. The two councilors Zhong Yuliang and Lu Yinchu received them and promised to forward the request to the assembly for resolution.</p>
<p>3. Representatives of more than 100,000 residents living in enemy-puppet houses in Shanghai requested: (1) When the authorities auction houses, they should only auction their property rights, and do not make residents homeless! (2) Hope to maintain the status quo and live in peace and work! (3) Request the authorities not to force eviction and aggravate Shanghai's housing shortage! (4) Hope that the handling authorities will not violate public opinion and cause social unrest! (5) The property is enemy-puppet, but the people are not enemy-puppet, do not deprive the freedom of residence! The two councilors Wang Xianqing and Yan Yunsheng received them and accepted the opinions on their behalf, promising to submit them to the assembly for discussion and public resolution.</p>
<p>4. Representatives of unemployed workers from the rear came to Shanghai to petition, making three requests: (1) Request all factories to give priority to hiring unemployed workers from the rear. (2) The state-run China Agricultural Machinery Factory, jointly run by the Executive Yuan and the Agricultural and Forestry Commission, refuses to hire workers from the rear. Please negotiate with the factory to give priority to hiring them as much as possible. (3) Request the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to allocate winter necessities to unemployed workers. Received by Shui Xiangyun and submitted to the assembly for resolution.</p>
<h3>Former Chinese Employees of the Two Concessions Petitioned at the Consulate Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] More than 1,500 Chinese personnel from the former Public Concession Era, such as the Municipal Council's Police Department and Fire Brigade, gathered on the lawn of the British Consulate on the Bund outside Suzhou Creek yesterday morning, requesting the return of savings, pensions, and funeral funds previously stored in the Municipal Council. Yesterday was Sunday, and the British Consul-General and Deputy Consul-General were initially not in the consulate. They arrived at the consulate at 10 a.m. after hearing the news and discussed with the representative, Yao Zongmo, the former chief inspector of the Municipal Council Police Department. The petitioners were scattered on the lawn of the consulate waiting for a reply and chanted slogans asking the British Consulate to quickly release the savings accumulated from their blood and sweat. According to the previous Municipal Council, in order to reward police and fire personnel, they organized savings, where employees saved five yuan per month. Those who worked for one year received double pay at the end of the year, and one month's salary also had to be saved. Those who worked for eleven years had seven months deducted each month, and the Municipal Council added a bonus of eight yuan, totaling fifteen yuan deposited in the bank. Those who voluntarily retired after working for fifteen years, in addition to the savings plus interest, would also receive an additional year's salary. The above bonuses were kept by the Municipal Council. The petitioners all kept various receipts. They believed that the persons in charge of the Municipal Council were mostly British, so they firmly demanded that the British Consul convert and pay each person's due savings in accordance with the multiple of prices. At 11:30 a.m., the British Consul-General came forward and replied in public that after consulting with Mayor Wu today, representatives could be sent to listen to the reply on the 15th, and stated that the former Public Concession was a combination of more than two countries, and the United Kingdom only occupied one of them. The petitioners were satisfied and left. It is heard that there are more than 3,000 Chinese personnel in the bureau, and many have served for more than 20 years. According to current prices, each person can get about 10 to 20 million yuan.</p>
<p>More than 400 former French Municipal Bureau employees also gathered at the Sino-French School in Baxianqiao at 10 a.m. yesterday, requesting the French Consulate on Jinling Road, the Bund, to issue various accumulated funds. They also dispersed after mediation.</p>
<h3>Opening Ceremony of the Administrative Class of the Central Training Corps; Chief Education Officer Huang Presides over the Ceremony</h3>
<p>General Huang Jie, Chief Education Officer of the Central Training Corps, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing at 8 a.m. yesterday. After getting off the train, Huang immediately went to the Shanghai Branch of the Central Training Corps on Shuidao Road, Zhabei, with Director Xuan Tiewu to preside over the opening ceremony of the training class for administrative personnel of the corps. The ceremony began at 10 a.m., attended by Mayor Wu Guozhen, Chief Commissioner Fang Zhi, Director Yang Junmai, etc. Huang, Chief Education Officer, presided over the meeting and delivered a speech. Before the speech began, Huang read the training speech of Chairman Jiang, who also served as the head of the corps. Huang also said that the purpose of veteran officers participating in retraining is to transform consumption into production and destruction into construction. The War of Resistance has been won, and the focus of future work is on construction. In the past, officers at all levels have made their best efforts to defend the country. Participating in national construction in the future is far more important than serving on the battlefield. The corps leader and deputy corps leader attach great importance to this. It is hoped that the trainees will adhere to this spirit and work tirelessly to complete the mission of national construction. After Huang's speech, Chief Commissioner Fang, Mayor Wu, and Director Xuan spoke in succession. The ceremony ended at 12 noon. It is heard that more than 2,000 officers from various corps were selected to participate in the administrative class. Due to traffic congestion, as of yesterday, 920 people had reported. More should arrive one after another. The training period for the class is three months. Upon completion, they will be assigned and employed by the Ministry of Interior.</p>

<h3>President Sun Solemnly Corrects and Denies House Litigation</h3>
<p>According to a letter from the Secretariat of President Sun Ke's Mansion: "Regarding the news published in Shanghai and Nanjing newspapers on January 10 that there is a house dispute in Shanghai involving President Sun, I have received the following statement: President Sun has no houses for rent in Shanghai other than the mansion where he lives.

<p>Also, Dai Rongduo wrote a letter: "I have just read the news "Judge Disputes Over House Involving Socialite" published on the second page of today's newspaper, which involves me and is inconsistent with the facts. The house at No. 4 Rose Villa, Baiyun Zhong Road, has always been rented by my sister Dai Shaoru, and I am not the tenant. The house at No. 11 Haiyuan, Haig Road, is also owned by her, and I am not the owner. There should be a lease deed to prove it. I dare not falsely claim it. I believe in the authority of your newspaper's news and its wide circulation. I am sincerely afraid that rumors will spread and cause misunderstandings. Please publish my letter to correct the record. I am deeply grateful. Dai Rongduo, January 10."</p>

<h3>Year-End Customs Record</h3>
<p>Christmas has passed, and the New Year is also gone. Although the Gregorian calendar has been adopted for thirty-five years, people still fondly remember the old lunar calendar. During the Gregorian New Year, apart from the holidays and celebrations in institutions and schools, and the relative liveliness in entertainment venues, there is really nothing worth recording. On the contrary, these past few days, everyone has been busy preparing for the Lunar New Year, which is much more vibrant and colorful.</p>
<p>This annual Lunar New Year is taken very seriously in terms of customs. Honoring the gods and ancestors requires a lot of preparation. Regarding the customs of celebrating the New Year in Shanghai, Zhang Chunhua wrote eight "Shanghai Seasonal Songs." Here are four of them to give a glimpse of the old Shanghai's year-end scene. Although "outdated," they still serve as conversation pieces.</p>
<p>Fruits are displayed in abundance on the streets,</p>
<p>A sixty-day business, it is said.</p>
<p>Vegetables from the mountains fear being disliked,</p>
<p>Tender bamboo shoots are always called embroidered shoes.</p>
<p>This is the first of the eight songs, describing the street scene. Generally, families always buy some things for the New Year, preparing for year-end sacrifices or entertaining relatives and friends during the New Year. Consequently, many temporary vendors come to catch the year-end trade. Among them, the southern goods business is the most lively, hence the nickname "sixty-day shop." In Shanghai customs, dried bamboo shoots are indispensable for the New Year. Large pieces are mountain bamboo shoots, soaked in water and thinly sliced, then cooked with meat, a necessary dish for New Year's Eve. The tenderest bamboo shoots, because their shape resembles the small feet of women in the past, are called "embroidered shoe soles," which is quite sensual. Even now, at the end of each year, there are often people in the alleys calling out to sell sliced dried bamboo shoots, which is also a kind of temporary business at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Carrying baskets of reeds into the city,</p>
<p>Village fruits and vegetables fill the roads.</p>
<p>Why are the straw shoulder poles all unloaded?</p>
<p>Calculating to buy arrowheads for the Kitchen God's sacrifice.</p>
<p>Besides the good business for southern goods stores at the end of the year, people from nearby villages also come to the city to catch the trade. They bring vegetables and fruits into the city to exchange for some southern goods to take back for the New Year. Ordinary families also prepare some sesame cakes at the end of the year, because they cannot be bought during the New Year. Especially many seasonal items, which must be bought. Like arrowheads are necessary for Kitchen God’s sacrifice.</p>
<p>Faint thunder echoes across the short fence,</p>
<p>Grinding fragrant rice, looking like snow.</p>
<p>Teaching weavers to compete in ingenuity,</p>
<p>Fruit fillings are innovated to compete in flour craft.</p>
<p>Powdered grains are seasonal foods at the end of the year, so Shanghai customs dictate grinding flour to make grains at the year's end. Powdered grains are of two kinds, dry and wet. The wet kind is soup grains, and the dry kind is called "gold ingots," which are steamed in bamboo steamers. The filling inside has many varieties, commonly meat or bean paste. But the daughters-in-law often show ingenuity and compete with each other, using various fruits and vegetables to make fillings, which is one aspect of recipe innovation.</p>
<p>Every family makes New Year cakes by pounding flour,</p>
<p>Seeming to emulate the height of Suzhou and Taiwan's cakes each year.</p>
<p>Entering shops, it's as if it's the eighth month of autumn,</p>
<p>Osmanthus fragrance subtly dyes the cold robes.</p>
<p>Powdered grains and New Year cakes are embellishments for the year's end and the year's beginning. Upper-class families in Shanghai all hire people to make cakes. Pounding flour and mixing it with maltose, hammering it to make it firm. All cakes are rectangular and come in red and white colors. Some even collect osmanthus flowers from the eighth month and decorate the cake surface, naming it "Osmanthus New Year Cake," which has an even better fragrance. Nowadays, tea and food stores all sell New Year cakes. "A building every five steps, a pavilion every ten steps." They are everywhere, so residents don't have to bother making them themselves. Families who make their own cakes are probably a very small minority now.</p>
<h3>Incense Smoke Lingering, Candlelight Flickering: At the Rainbow Temple, Devout Men and Women Burn Incense and Kowtow in Gratitude Before Fortunate Gods, While Those with Bad Luck Pray and Seek a Fortune</h3>
<p>It's the end of the lunar year again. Throughout the year, many "lucky" people, as usual, go to "Buddha" to burn incense and kowtow in gratitude, and many "unlucky" people go to "Buddha" to "cry out" for mercy, begging the "greatly compassionate" Buddha to grant them good luck next year.</p>
<p>Therefore, during those two days, the Rainbow Temple on Nanjing Road suddenly becomes lively.</p>
<p>The red-lacquered gate and palace-style structure, squeezed next to the rows of foreign-style buildings and mansions on Nanjing Road, appear particularly out of place. Every time I pass by, I always feel a bit of humor. However, aren't all Chinese things laughable when you break them down?</p>
<p>The Rainbow Temple was originally named "Bao'an Situ Temple." Before the Songhu War, it was just like a broken temple in the countryside, "without any makeup." Later, devout men and women donated money to renovate the facade, making the exterior look more beautiful, but the inside remains the same as before.</p>
<p>Stepping into the temple gate, plaques such as "Every Prayer is Answered" and "Protecting One Area" on the walls above and on both sides are dazzling. To the left of the door is a clean stall selling "Guanyin Sutra," "Buddha's Amitabha Sutra," "Diamond Sutra," and so on. Further in, one can immediately see the fortune tellers in the "fortune-telling halls," stroking their beards and talking eloquently to customers sitting at the tables. Next to another door hangs a wooden sign that says "XXX Doctor of Internal Medicine, Gynecology, and General Pulse."</p>
<p>Inside the main hall, incense smoke lingers, and the inscriptions on the plaques above the hall have been blurred by smoke. However, the light here seems to be slightly better than that of the City God Temple in Nanshi. In the hazy smoke, many people are lighting incense and candles, kneeling, praying, and seeking fortunes. These people include old grandmothers with wrinkled skin and white hair, modern women with permed hair, simple and honest country folks, and coolies in blue cloth shirts and pants...</p>
<p>Stepping into the "Guan Yu Hall," one sees Zhou Cang with his black face, leading the Red Hare horse. Perhaps for the New Year, the Red Hare horse has also been given a new look, with a green vegetable in its mouth. Coming out and passing in front of the main hall, a woman in a black fox fur coat and a red scarf is devoutly kowtowing. Out of curiosity, the reporter randomly drew a fortune stick from the fortune box on the table. It was the twenty-fourth Guanyin fortune. After paying 200 yuan in legal currency, I exchanged it for a yellow paper at the counter on the left, which turned out to be a "very bad" fortune. It read:</p>
<p>"Neither a neighbor nor a family,</p>
<p>Forever indulging in foolishness like fallen flowers.</p>
<p>If you ask for the emperor's favor, it's hard to get help,</p>
<p>In the end, everything is as chaotic as hemp."</p>
<p>Wandering out of the "Zodiac Hall," the incense and candle shop next to the temple is rushing to renovate its facade. For decades, this shop has prospered thanks to the Rainbow Temple. Every year at the end of the lunar year, the temple is filled with visitors, and the shop is also extremely crowded, with a feeling of "guests being treated as if they were at home." "New Year" is coming, so it must be time to do good business!</p>
<p>Yuanbao Tea</p>
<p>In a society eager for wealth, during the Lunar New Year, in addition to hearing "Congratulations and may you prosper" and other auspicious greetings, "Yuanbao Tea" is also used to serve guests, taking its pronunciation for good luck. Yuanbao Tea is made by putting Chinese olives in tea. These green olives are bitter and astringent at first taste, but have a clear, fragrant, and sweet aftertaste, so they are quite popular. But who knows who "called a deer a horse" and named them "yuanbao" to cater to the public's desire for wealth? After the olives gained the elegant name of "yuanbao," their value immediately increased tenfold, soaring during the Lunar New Year, and this year will certainly not be an exception. Fortunately, "yuanbao" are welcomed by everyone, and although the price of olives has increased, they are still valued everywhere.</p>
<h3>Qi Zhen</h3>
<p>"Although ancestors are distant, sacrifices must be sincere." Our country, a patriarchal society, considers ancestors unforgettable. At the year's end, the living can enjoy themselves in a timely manner, and the deceased must also be honored. Therefore, portraits of ancestors are brought out, with fruit platters, pastries, wine, and dishes displayed, incense is burned, and candles are lit. This is what is called "Qi Zhen."</p>
<p>Portraits of ancestors are usually not charcoal sketches or photographs, but scrolls. Men wear court attire with official hats, and women wear phoenix coronets and robes. There are also collective images of three, four, or five generations in Ming Dynasty attire, exuding ancient charm. In wealthy families, the walls are lined with portraits, making the photography studios in the city temples pale in comparison.</p>
<p>Portraits are usually hung from December 25th and taken down after the Lantern Festival, but some are only hung for the first five days of the New Year. In addition to family members kowtowing, relatives and friends who visit during the Lunar New Year must also kowtow before the portraits as a New Year's greeting.</p>
<h3>The Story of Lucky Money: Nan Gai, at Five Years Old, Pays Homage to the Emperor</h3>
<p>Children are happiest during holidays, and the New Year makes them even happier. In addition to good food and new clothes, they also receive a red envelope after bowing and kowtowing, which is called "lucky money." For children who usually only spend and have no income, lucky money is their largest sum of wealth.</p>
<p>There is a story in "Marvels Old and New" about "Nan Gai, at Five Years Old, Paying Homage to the Emperor," which is said to be the origin of lucky money. Wang Shao's five-year-old son, Nan Gai, was watching lanterns with his family during the Lantern Festival when he was carried away by a villain. It happened that the emperor was at the upper pavilion, and Nan Gai cried out to him. The thief was captured. The emperor was pleased with his courage and gave him money and fruit to soothe his fright. Thus, the custom of "giving lucky money every year" has been passed down to this day. Since then, every year near the end of the year, adults give money to the younger generation as a matter of course.</p>
<p>Ancient lucky money was very meaningful, with copper coins strung together with red and green silk threads, tied into various shapes. Those with pointed ends shaped like olives were called "yuanbao money," and those in the shape of an "X" were called "victory money," which were more common. There were also those who were more creative, doing everything possible to compete in ingenuity, all to gain good luck. The distribution of such lucky money was determined by the accountants of large families. Copper coins that were tied very tightly, plus a string of prayer beads, were beautifully named "ruyi money," wrapped in gold-stamped red paper and placed in a brocade box. It was truly a special skill of the time. Many embroidery shops specialized in wrapping them for people, which was also a side business for women, but unfortunately, it is now difficult to find one or two people who can tie lucky money.</p>
<p>When silver dollars were popular in the past, lucky money was usually one yuan. As prices rose, lucky money also increased. "Lucky money every year, increasing wealth every year." In this recessionary year, the lucky money spent cannot be considered a small amount. Since the abolition of silver dollars, colorful banknotes do not seem as substantial as silver coins, so some people have come up with a lucky money bag. The banknotes are stuffed into a plum-red envelope, which is indeed beautifully decorated. These inexpensive and beautiful lucky money bags are a good year-end business for paper shops.</p>
<p>Some children whose fathers have more extensive social circles have considerable income from lucky money each year. If this money could be saved up as education expenses for the children in the future, wouldn't it be very meaningful? Unfortunately, most of it is used to buy food, toys, or even used as gambling money, which is a problem worthy of discussion in education.</p>
<h3>The Origin of the Kitchen God</h3>
<p>The custom of sacrificing to the Kitchen God has a very ancient origin. The bronze tripod says, "Sacrifices are exhausted at the stove." The Huainanzi says, "The Yellow Emperor created the stove and became the Kitchen God after death." The Xijing Miscellany says, "The Kitchen God looks like a beautiful woman." The legends are truly diverse and inconclusive. Another interesting saying is that the Kitchen God's common name was Wu Ji. He was poor and lived by selling firewood, and he was very filial to his mother. One day, he met a physiognomist who told him that a great disaster was about to befall him and that he should avoid it quickly. When asked how to avoid it, the physiognomist said, "You will have a hundred days of imprisonment. Go home and draw a prison on the ground with lime. You can avoid it by going out again after a hundred days." After saying this, the physiognomist suddenly disappeared. Wu Ji knew there was something unusual. He hesitated to pick up the firewood. Suddenly, one end of the firewood fell off, and the carrying pole struck a passerby on the head, killing him instantly. Wu Ji was arrested and sent to the magistrate. After inquiring, the magistrate learned that Wu Ji had an eighty-year-old mother and should be allowed to return home to visit her. The magistrate praised his filial piety and temporarily released him. After returning home, Wu Ji drew a prison on the ground and sat there for ninety-nine days. He went to the magistrate again. The magistrate asked why the family of the deceased had not come. Wu Ji replied that he was in mourning. The magistrate investigated and found it to be true, so he did not pursue the matter further. Wu Ji died of illness and was conferred the title of Kitchen God, the head of the family, monitoring the words and deeds of the family members, recording their good and bad deeds for reward and punishment. So it goes. Consult and borrow.</p>
<h3>Ten-Ingredient Vegetable Dish: A Must-Have for Every Family</h3>
<p>The ten-ingredient vegetable dish is a must-have dish for Shanghai people during the Lunar New Year. It is made with wood ear fungus, daylily buds, bean sprouts, lotus root, carrots, pickled cucumber, pickled cabbage, bamboo shoots, tofu skin, and so on, stir-fried together. Whether it is a large or small household, a lot must be stir-fried. Especially for families with many people, almost a whole jar must be stir-fried, prepared for eating during the New Year. It is said that those vegetables all have very good auspicious meanings.</p>
<p>In addition, soybean sprouts are called "ruyi vegetables," arrowhead with arrowhead (water chestnuts) and pickled vegetables are called "peace and happiness vegetables," and shepherd's purse is called "escape from suffering vegetables." All are seasonal dishes during the New Year, hence bestowed with auspicious names.</p>
<h3>Year-End Flower Market: Chinese Winter Sweet and Heavenly Bamboo Compete in Beauty</h3>
<p>The bright red poinsettias, adorned with Christmas, contrast beautifully with the green Christmas trees and white snowflakes. As Christmas and the New Year pass, the poinsettias wither away. Replacing them are the solitary Chinese winter sweet, the heavenly bamboo with its red berries, the yellow and crispy wintersweet, and the elegant narcissus, all of which are desk decorations at the end of the lunar year. They seem more elegant than the poinsettias.</p>
<p>Shanghai, a city with ten feet of dust, is disconnected from gardening. The cramped houses are already enough to bear, let alone having space to cultivate flowers and plant bamboo, doing the cheerful task of nurturing the spirit. Ordinary upper-middle-class families, to make their houses more beautiful, go to the market to buy flowers. On weekdays, the flower market is filled with foreign flowers such as roses, violets, foreign chrysanthemums, lilies, dahlias, etc., which are supplied to foreigners and modern ladies. In addition, flower baskets for celebrations and wreaths for funerals are also a major business.</p>
<p>But when the New Year is approaching, domestic flowers, which usually do not attract much attention, compete in beauty in the market. In addition to the seasonal plum blossoms, heavenly bamboo, and narcissus, there are also very exquisite bonsai, with vigorous branches and leaves emerging from the old tree stumps, full of poetic and artistic feeling.</p>
<p>Plum Blossoms and Camellias: "Exploring Plum Blossoms" is an elegant pursuit for scholars. Dengwei and Gushan do not know how many tourists they have attracted. People who cannot escape this noisy city also want to get a few potted plum trees to decorate their studies and living rooms, to show elegance. Therefore, there are quite a few plum trees on display in the flower market. Each old and eroded branch, like bronze, rock, dragon coiling, and tiger crouching, is tied with a blooming flower. Some are so-called split plum blossoms, like being inserted on a piece of wood, which is extremely strange. There are also those who add pine and bamboo next to the plum blossoms, becoming a picture of the Three Friends of Winter, which is especially welcomed.</p>
<p>Heavenly Bamboo: The heavenly bamboo, with strings of blood-red berries revealed in the emerald green leaves, symbolizes the glory of the new spring and brings the light of the future. Of course, you must choose those with many berries, because the beauty of the whole heavenly bamboo lies in these few red berries, but having berries without leaves is too monotonous. The green leaves are essential. The sellers tie together those with berries but no leaves and those with leaves but no berries, making it a perfect heavenly bamboo, and the price also increases a lot. This is what flower buyers should pay attention to.</p>
<p>Wintersweet: Wintersweet and heavenly bamboo are truly a match made in heaven. When the berries of the heavenly bamboo turn red, it is also the time when the wintersweet blooms. Green leaves, red berries, and yellow flowers make for the most moving picture. Wintersweet with a plain heart and wide mouth is considered the best, because ordinary wintersweet mostly has a red heart, so a plain heart is more precious, and the fragrance is also very rich. In the market, there are still many wintersweet with plain hearts, but those with wide mouths are rare, which is truly a pity.</p>
<p>Narcissus: The narcissus, known as the "fairy on the water," also comes to join the fun at this time. A burst of fragrance seems to be enticing passersby. Narcissus is divided into single-petal and double-petal. It is generally believed that double-petal is better, but the single-petal is the real old-fashioned narcissus. In terms of form, there is also a difference between straight plants and crab claws. Crab claws are made artificially, so they are more precious. In many flower shops, there are also foreign narcissus on display. Although they have colorful flowers, they are not as elegant as domestic narcissus.</p>
<p>Flower Market: Before the war, the headquarters of the year-end flower market was in the City God Temple. After the war, it moved to the area of Second Ma Road and Wangping Street. Under the Cishu Building, it became an annual flower market. On the walls of the foreign cemetery, it simply became a large screen composed of cold plum blossoms, heavenly bamboo, and wintersweet. People who cannot go to Dengwei and Gushan might as well treat this place as a "plum-viewing resort." This year, the City God Temple is already very lively, but the prosperity near the Cishu Building should not be too deserted.</p>
<p>Flower Vendors: The flowers here mostly come from villages more than ten miles away. Some are villagers who use this time to earn some money for the New Year by selling the crystallization of their cultivation, while others are flower vendors who transport the flowers from the countryside to the city to supply the needs of the Spring Festival. Some are young people, some are old women, and some are young girls, relying on their clever tongues to deal with their customers.</p>
<p>High Prices: In several large companies, the flower trade is usually very quiet, but it has also become lively these days. The prices of fresh flowers displayed in the company are very different from those on the flower stalls, especially the potted plants cultivated by experts. In the eyes of people with artistic cultivation, they are elegant and refined, but ordinary people cannot help but stick out their tongues when they see the prices.</p>
<p>With high prices, the seasonal wintersweet, heavenly bamboo, and cold plum blossoms are priced in the tens of thousands. Because in this recessionary year, all industries are very depressed, not to mention flowers, which are regarded as luxury goods. It seems that although there are crowded people and many who appreciate and browse, there are few who really buy flowers!</p>
<h3>Dried Bamboo Shoots, Vermicelli, White Sugar, Red Dates: People on the Road Hustle and Bustle, Busy Preparing for the New Year</h3>
<p>These days, there are more people coming and going on the roads, and the shops are also crowded, fully showing the scene of celebrating the New Year. For the New Year, New Year's Eve dinner, and spring wine, many things are needed. Housewives usually have to work hard for these many things, which is called preparing for the New Year. All stores "profit threefold," among which southern goods stores, incense and candle stores, liquor stores, soy sauce stores, barbershops, pastry shops, etc., have even more prosperous business. There are also many temporary stalls that catch the good business of the year-end.</p>
<p>Southern goods stores are the most lively during the New Year. Some set up arches at the entrance of the store and hang a pair of earth lamps, shining brightly at night. Layer upon layer of customers surround the counter, making it impenetrable. Although the store clerks temporarily add manpower, they are still busy in circles. Dried bamboo shoots, vermicelli, white sugar, red dates, lotus seeds... etc., one by one they "select," "weigh," and "pack" for the customers. When several large customers come to the door, the clerks are particularly attentive, serving tea and melon seeds, and then packing all the things the guests want to buy one by one. If they are old customers, they can also enjoy a 10% discount. If they are ladies from the countryside, they will receive a complimentary packet of peanuts or melon seeds.</p>
<p>Incense, Candles, and Paper Ingots: Still Hard to Stop</p>
<p>Incense and candle shops are a kind of superstitious business. On weekdays, every lunar new moon, or the birthday of gods and Buddhas, the business is already considerable. During the Lunar New Year, business is even busier. Most of the facades are decorated to be brand new, with lotus oil lamps lit for decoration. Candles are also a major transaction at the end of the year. Although electric lights are bright now, every household must buy a few pairs of candles, just to be seasonal. Other items such as divine horses, yuanbao, and paper ingots are sold in large quantities. Firecrackers are also seasonal goods in incense and candle shops. In addition to being used for worshiping gods, children also use them as toys.</p>
<p>Oil, Salt, Sauce, Vinegar: Buy a Whole Jar</p>
<p>The so-called seven things to start the day, among them oil, salt, sauce, and vinegar, must be bought from the soy sauce garden. On weekdays, liquor and sauce shops are inseparable from citizens. At the end of the year, the demand increases even more, especially the wine for worshiping gods and the oil for cooking, which are almost several times more than usual. At least enough for ten days or half a month during the New Year must be prepared, so most people who walk into liquor and soy sauce shops come out with bottles full. Wealthy families buy whole jars of wine and original boxes of oil to prepare for the New Year.</p>
<p>Pickled Meat Shops: Suddenly Lively</p>
<p>Pickled meat shops, which are originally very quiet, suddenly become lively these days. When there is no fresh meat to sell at the beginning of the year, pickled meat can be stored for a long time. If guests come occasionally during the New Year, it can be conveniently taken out as a dish. This is a decoration for the New Year, beautifully named "hometown meat." At this time, in addition to the original pickled meat shops, there are also many temporary shops with only a tabletop and a hard board. As soon as you open the door, you see red paper strips with large price reductions. Some even hired a band to play music in the shop, making it particularly lively.</p>
<p>Barbershops are even more "full of guests." Although there is a sign on the wall that says "Agreed by the Industry Association, All Prices Doubled," using peach-red paper, it is particularly eye-catching, but the customers who come to the door are still in an endless stream, because no one wants to have long and messy hair in the New Year.</p>
<p>Seasonal Foods: New Year Cake is the Top Choice</p>
<p>New Year cake is a well-deserved seasonal food, as valued as the zongzi of the Dragon Boat Festival and the mooncakes of the Mid-Autumn Festival. Many pastry shops put aside their usual work and specialize in making New Year cakes to meet the market. On the counters of tea and food shops, New Year cakes are also stacked high, and in many new-style food shops, New Year cakes are decorated with many characters and patterns, placed in glass brocade boxes, raising their status. Next to the vegetable market, in the gaps in the shops, there are temporary New Year cake workshops, most of which specialize in making Ningbo New Year cakes.</p>
<p>In addition to the shops mentioned above, other shops such as shoes and hats, fruits, candies, cigarettes, tin foil, and clothing all have more business than usual. In the vegetable market, chicken, duck, fish, and meat are also more abundant than usual. However, this is only a temporary phenomenon. Once the Lantern Festival passes, business will return to normal.</p>
<h3>Housewives Personally Take Charge, All Returning Fully Loaded</h3>
<p>Most of those who prepare for the New Year are housewives who personally take charge. Walking into the store, they are greeted with smiling faces. After selecting, they return with baskets full and bags large and small, either by private car or by calling a tricycle, all returning fully loaded. But there are also wives of poor families, because their husbands' income is not much, and the funds used to prepare for the New Year are even more limited. Buying this, lacking that, they are also very hesitant. As the saying goes, "Poor couples have a hundred sorrows," which is even more evident at the Lunar New Year. However, to put it another way, every virtuous wife, under today's difficult situation, should understand the difficulty of making a living and not take the customs of celebrating the New Year too seriously. The luxury of the neighbors is not worth envying. Being able to reconcile with her husband and children, and sit together, is the joy of the world. Raising a glass to drink, everyone should bless the New Year.</p>

<h3>Finance Deputy Xu Baiwei Claims This Year Can Be Considered an Economic Construction Year; Production Loans Must Be Used Appropriately; While Productive Enterprises Rely on Capital Assistance, They Must Have Cooperation from All Sides to Succeed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Xu Baiyuan, Deputy Minister of Finance and Secretary-General of the Four Joint Treasury, stated that since the establishment of the Provisional Review Committee for Production Enterprise Loans on December 10th of last year, one month has passed. To ensure that all sectors understand the recent situation of the committee, he specially invited the city's news media to the conference room of the Four Joint Branch on the first floor of the Bank of China Building at 4:00 PM yesterday. Mr. Xu delivered a speech as follows:</p>
<p>This production enterprise loan is handled in accordance with Premier Song's repeated instructions and the principle of actively assisting the development of production enterprises. It has been progressing smoothly for a month. All members of the committee are socially respected leaders and are undoubtedly very busy with official duties. However, they are able to attend the meetings three times a week in person and discuss matters seriously. This spirit of putting public interests before personal ones is truly admirable. In my opinion, the production loan method is a major test of financial and economic cooperation in construction in the future. The following three points deserve special attention:</p>
<p>(1) To mobilize the manpower and financial resources of all financial institutions to assist the development of industrial and commercial enterprises: In the past, financial business responsibilities related to the implementation of national policies have also enjoyed the right to rediscount with the Central Bank. All commercial banks and firms can, in accordance with the principles, not only utilize the strength of all financial institutions to assist the development of production enterprises, but also urge commercial banks and firms to work hard to promote normal business and guide capital into the path of active construction. In particular, it can strengthen the ties between national financial institutions and commercial banks and firms, take uniform steps, and jointly bear the heavy responsibility of economic construction in the future. As for the responsibility issue of commercial banks and firms, the government has made extremely reasonable decisions and will not allow them to be burdened as a result.</p>
<p>(2) In order to fully realize the effectiveness of the loaned funds and ensure that they are fully used for legitimate production purposes, negative aspects must avoid improper use. On the positive side, the role of increasing production must be brought into play. Because the current economic and financial situation has not yet reached a completely stable state, we sincerely hope for the development of production enterprises and will try every means to provide loan assistance. However, if loans are obtained under the guise of production but are used for speculation and hoarding, it will actually harm the interests of the entire society and damage the reputation of production enterprises. Therefore, the pre-review by this committee must be cautious and thorough, and the post-assessment should be as strict as possible. In the future, for factories that work hard to increase production, can properly use loans, increase output, and improve quality, we will continue to provide greater assistance to encourage the development of their business. As for internal handling procedures, we strive for simplicity. General application cases can be completed within one week. Staff members take little rest even during holidays so that there will be no delays due to thoroughness and caution.</p>
<p>(3) To seek close cooperation among financial business, government, and various sectors of society, and to jointly seek progress. It is important to know that the development of production enterprises, in addition to capital assistance, also relies on cooperation from all aspects of administration and society to succeed. For example, technological improvement, labor-management coordination, raw material supply, smooth transportation, tax system adjustment, and the supervision and encouragement of public opinion are all closely related. Since the establishment of this committee, we have been deeply grateful for the assistance from relevant government departments and all sectors of society, as well as the encouragement from the media. The staff is excited and deeply believes that continuing to develop this spirit of mutual cooperation and mutual assistance will lay a solid foundation for the future of China's production enterprises, that is, the future of economic construction, and will greatly benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>In short, future construction issues should prioritize production. Everything that is conducive to the development of production should be done to the best of our ability. Shanghai has always been the leader of the country's economy, and it is hoped that it will set an example and serve as a demonstration for the whole country. Regarding the handling of production enterprise loans in other important areas, Premier Song has also approved general rules and designated Tianjin, Beiping, Qingdao, Wuhan, Nanchang, Changsha, Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Guangzhou, and other places to be held together. It is hoped that the media will provide more guidance.</p>
<h3>General Rules for Production Enterprise Loans in Various Regions</h3>
<p>The full text of the eleven articles of the "General Rules for Production Enterprise Loans in Various Regions" was passed by the 334th Board of Directors of the Four Joint Treasury on January 9th of this year. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In areas designated by the Four Joint Treasury, national banks and other financial institutions should handle production enterprise loans in accordance with these general rules. (2) The loan targets are limited to the following industries: 1. Essential goods manufacturing industries. 2. Mining. 3. Export trade goods manufacturing industries. 4. Local specialty industries. 5. Other approved industries. (3) The nature of the loan is limited to assisting the necessary working capital of various industries. The expenses for adding machinery and equipment should be raised by the industries themselves. (4) In addition to raw materials and finished products, machinery and equipment, together with factory buildings and bases, can be added as collateral, but shall not exceed 50%. (5) The loan interest rate should be proposed by the local Four Joint Branch, taking into account the local situation, and reported to the Four Joint Treasury for approval. (6) The loan period is tentatively set at six months. (7) Other loan conditions should be handled with reference to the various measures for production enterprise loans in the Shanghai area. (8) Applications for loans from various industries should be individually submitted to the local Four Joint Branch or applied for by the banks on behalf of the Four Joint Branch. (9) Loans approved by the Four Joint Branch, whose amount is less than 50 million yuan, may be loaned by the local bank first and reported for record. Loans exceeding 50 million yuan shall be reported to the Four Joint Treasury for approval on a case-by-case basis. (10) Production enterprise loans approved by various banks may be re-mortgaged, re-pledged, or rediscounted with the Central Bank at 80%. (11) Provincial and municipal local banks, commercial banks, and money shops that transfer production enterprise loans approved by the local Four Joint Branch for handling in accordance with these general rules shall also be allowed to re-mortgage, re-pledge, or rediscount with the Central Bank at 80%. (12) These general rules shall be implemented after being approved by the Board of Directors of the Four Joint Treasury.</p>
<h3>Deputy Director Xu's Explanation</h3>
<p>Mr. Xu then briefly explained the loan guidelines. He said that the original provision had a total of seven articles, later expanded to twelve articles by the Premier Song's instructions. The main loan target is the manufacturing industry. The provision in Article 2, Paragraph 5, is intended to indicate that the loan target has flexibility so that other approved businesses can also apply for loans. However, businesses such as transportation and public utilities, because of the massive scale, are not included. As for the handling of loan cases, in Shanghai, the situation is complex and there are many cases, so a production loan association is specially established under the structure of the Four Joint Branches. In other regions, in addition to the local Four Joint Branches being in charge, they can also liaise with the local Ministry of Economic Affairs' Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office and the Chamber of Commerce to obtain technical assistance. Provincial and municipal local banks have the mission of assisting local production enterprises in accordance with the rules for managing banks by the Ministry of Finance, so they should be able to participate in undertaking local production and entertainment loans. As for bad debt events that may occur in commercial banks’ loans, Xu believes that there is no need to worry too much. The government's position will never embarrass commercial banks as a result. In the end, we hope to seek a reasonable solution based on the actual situation.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Xu answered questions from reporters. The main points are as follows: (1) The reason why loans are limited to the necessary working capital of various industries is to encourage factories that have already achieved results to increase production. And these factories must at least have considerable fixed production equipment so that they can fully produce after obtaining a loan. (2) Some people think that the provision of 50 million yuan in Article 9 of the local loan guidelines is too small. This point will be reviewed and relaxed. He deeply hopes that the human and financial resources of local provinces and cities and commercial banks can be used for production purposes so that financial business can tend to assist production enterprises in the future. (4) Regarding the review of loan cases, we will uphold the principles of openness and strictness to show fairness. At the same time, we hope that the production loan in this city will be successful and become a model for other places. (5) Regarding the organization of the production loan association in this city, it is temporary in nature and hopes to end it in one or two months. However, the business of production loans will continue unabated. This year can be called the year of economic construction, so we urgently hope that production loans can cooperate with other economic conditions to promote domestic production enterprises and complete the great plan of national construction.</p>
<h3>Hankou Exporters Request Increased Exchange Settlement Subsidies</h3>
<p>Hankou exporters have recently stated that due to price fluctuations, export trade is difficult to develop. They have specially submitted proposals to the finance and economic departments, suggesting the following points: (1) Reform the subsidy system with a certain limit. For example, if exports can settle millions of US dollars, the government will provide certain subsidies according to the official price. When the subsidies increase, the amount should be subsidized using progressive methods. In this way, even if there is a difference in foreign prices, the subsidies obtained can be used as compensation. (2) Restore the wartime trade committee’s regulations on import and export linkage methods. When the government strictly controls imports and exports, if importers cannot easily obtain foreign exchange, they may request permission from exporters to use the foreign exchange obtained from exporting materials to purchase this imported goods, so that the profits obtained can compensate for export losses.</p>
<h3>Increased Cotton Production in Various Countries; Trade Competition Will Be Fierce</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] The major changes in the international textile situation recently should be attributed to the end of the Washington Joint Textile Committee on December 31 and the cancellation of the export reservation system. In recent years, the Joint Textile Committee has "allocated" cotton goods from the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, India, and Brazil to various markets in urgent need (but the method is still determined by each government when implemented). The export reservation system has recently forced American cotton yarn manufacturers to specially reserve a certain amount of production for export. In the first quarter of 1947, the large export volume of the United States was only a limit. It is difficult to guarantee whether overseas countries can obtain it. It probably depends on whether these countries can compete at high prices in the US domestic market with money or friendship. However, no country can compete with the United States in terms of money. Therefore, the United States will export to maintain its friendship in overseas markets, but whether it can reach 230 million yards remains to be seen. In 1946, Brazil and India stopped exporting for a long time due to frequent domestic shortages. It is generally believed that the US export volume has far exceeded the total limit. Brazil and India have resumed exporting, and European countries exporting cotton goods are more than a year ago. Japan is also recovering from a paralyzed state, so the quantity of international cotton trade and the scope of international competition are gradually increasing.</p>
<h3>The Banking and Money Shop Joint Reserve Will Handle Public Treasury Certificate Lending to Regulate the Year-End Funds of Various Banks and Shops</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking and Money Shop Joint Reserve is jointly organized by the city's banking and money shop industry. All member banks and money shops pay reserve assets, such as real estate, to enrich the reserves of various banks and shops. After evaluation and registration with the Land Administration Bureau, public treasury certificates are issued for these deposited reserve assets, which can be used for lending from the association. Now that the Lunar New Year is approaching, in order to regulate the funds of the banking and money shop industry, the association is adding purple handling of public treasury certificate lending. The lending interest rate is calculated based on the market rate.</p>
<h3>Tightening Credit Loans in the City's Banking and Money Shop Industry</h3>
<p>As the Lunar New Year approaches in an instant, in order to prevent the bad trend of bankruptcy, the banking and money shop industry in this city is planning to tighten credit loans to reduce risks. It is learned that the Sichuan help banks and shops in Shanghai have also begun to tighten measures on the loan side recently.</p>
<h3>MacArthur's Headquarters is Prepared to Remove and Dismantle Japanese Factories for Compensation</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 10th] MacArthur's headquarters announced today that it has not yet received instructions regarding the removal and dismantling of Japanese factory machinery as compensation. Once instructions are received, it will be handled immediately. MacArthur's headquarters has now designated about 1,000 Japanese factories to be dismantled and transported, but transportation procedures are a major problem. It is not known which country will provide ships to transport this industrial equipment to countries requesting compensation. China and the Philippines have no ships, and US ships may have to be used for transportation in the future. As for how to distribute the machinery from more than 1,000 Japanese factories that have already been designated, a list has been opened, but no final decision has been made. According to Washington, the State Department and the Army Department announced on the 9th that the United States has decided to immediately collect Japanese compensation, regardless of whether the Soviet Union and other wartime allies agree. According to Zhang Feier, acting director of the Far East Department of the State Department, an urgent instruction will be issued to MacArthur immediately to start removing and dismantling Japanese factories and their equipment for compensation. Army Deputy Minister Peterson also said that MacArthur and the Japanese government will be notified as soon as possible of which industries should be retained in Japan so that the Japanese can use it to seek economic recovery on a realistic basis and no longer rely on US aid. Although this action should be notified to the Far East Committee, it does not have to wait for its formal approval. In terms of the Japanese occupying forces, the United States has 124,000 troops and the United Kingdom has 40,000 troops. Peterson also said that the United States has transported more than 2 million tons of grain to Japan, which should be paid by Japan.</p>
<h3>Prominent Economist Keynes Comments on the Chinese Economy: Unbalanced Budget is the Main Cause of Deterioration</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 11th] Prominent economist Keynes wrote in the "Far Eastern Economic Review" that the biggest factor in China's current economic chaos is the unbalanced budget.</p>
<p>Keynes listed China's assets as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Enemy property in China, the amount is "amazing" and cannot be reliably calculated.</p>
<p>(2) Direct military compensation paid by Japan for funds and other items, China can divide about 2 billion US dollars for factories alone.</p>
<p>(3) Increased tax revenue. The government's current tax collection is "higher than before the war to an incomparable extent."</p>
<p>(4) UN relief to China, only cash, will reach 1 billion US dollars, not counting materials, medicines or industrial chemicals.</p>
<p>(5) The US military in China spends a lot of money.</p>
<p>(6) Recovering the Northeast and Taiwan, the assets in the two places are "huge."</p>
<p>(7) Foreign investment in China. The US government and private enterprises are willing to make long-term investments in China, but "if the civil war continues to exist, no one expects to sink funds into China."</p>
<p>(8) Remittances from overseas Chinese back to China. It is estimated that in 1946, the number will not be less than 100 million US dollars.</p>
<p>Keynes estimates the unfavorable factors as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Wages are "too high."</p>
<p>(2) The government does not have a clear policy, resulting in a lot of national wealth losses.</p>
<p>(3) Inconvenient transportation, which is now worse due to damage and CCP destruction.</p>
<p>(4) High interest rates and high tax rates destroy local industries.</p>
<p>(5) Smuggling loses tariffs and cannot control the entry of certain types of goods.</p>
<p>(6) Insufficient exports. Exports are the "main factor in rebuilding economic balance." In the first six months of 1946, Shanghai's exports were only 13% of imports, which was 89% in 1937.</p>
<p>(7) The civil war consumes 75% of China's budget, "unless this major burden is removed, the economy will continue to deteriorate."</p>
<p>Keynes ended by saying, "Frankly speaking, the Chinese economy has deteriorated to the point where it is quite difficult to immediately put it back on track."</p>
<h3>Dye and Pigment Names are Confused and Undifferentiated; the Chamber of Commerce Advises Correction</h3>
<p>Pigments and dyes were originally two different things. In this city, the names of dye shops and the names of associations are mistakenly called pigments, resulting in confusion with pigment shops. After the city's Chamber of Commerce received a request from the National Pigment and Sundry Goods Industry Association, it convened representatives of the two industries for talks at 2:00 PM yesterday. The representatives of the National Pigment and Sundry Goods Association (pigment industry) Wang Boheng, Fu Zhigao, and the representatives of the Pigment Industry Association (dye industry) Shan Liangyu, Wang Pengcheng, were present. The Chamber of Commerce was presided over by Mr. Pan Shihao and Wu Jichun. First, Wang Boheng, representative of the pigment industry, stated that pigments and dyes are not only legally classified by the government long ago, but also distinguished in the latest chemical industry encyclopedia personally ordered by Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. All countries in the world also have special names that are not confused. In this city, the name of the dye shop is mistakenly used as the pigment shop, and the industry's public Zeng mistakenly called the pigment industry association, which makes the clearly distinguished pigments and dyes confused and undifferentiated. At this time of industrial nation-building, pigments and dyes are both important modern industrial commodities, and it is natural to suggest that the government quickly correct the pigment association that operates dyes to the dye industry association, and the pigment indigo brand to the dye indigo, so that the names match the reality and disputes will be forever resolved, and it is also consistent with the names of various countries. Otherwise, if the confusion is allowed to continue, not only will the buyers have nowhere to go, but it will also affect international trade and educational construction. Then, the representative of the dye industry stated that the commodity operated by the industry is indeed dye, but because the city is used to the habit, it is very inconvenient to correct it once, and it firmly refuses to change it. At this point, the representative of the Chamber of Commerce told that since the commodity operated by your industry is dye, the name of the association and the name of the shop should be corrected separately to focus on reality. However, because the industry firmly expressed dissent, even after repeated persuasion, the meeting still had no results. Afterwards, according to the reporter of the National Pigment and Sundry Goods Industry Association, pigments and dyes, regardless of commodities, nature, and use, are all different. The dye industry should not insist on sticking to habits and confusing them. In order to adapt to the actual situation, the industry will continue to request reasonable adjustments from the competent authorities and social experts.</p>
<h3>High Wages and High-Interest Exploitation; Silk Cocoon Industry is Difficult to Revive</h3>
<p>According to a giant in the silk industry, the prosperity of my country's silk industry is not as good as that of Japan after the war. It is a well-known fact for the whole person. As for the secondary cocoon silk collection last year, due to high wages and the exploitation of high-interest loans, manufacturers suffered heavy losses. Although the government provided loans for relief and bought the spring silk produced at a price of 3.8 million, it still could not maintain it. The China Trust Bureau bought the finished silk and transported it to foreign countries to exchange for foreign exchange. Currently, the price of D-grade silk in the US market is 6.75 US dollars per pound, and each dan is calculated at 133 pounds, which is more than 800 US dollars. If you buy gold and transport it back (each silk can be exchanged for more than 20 taels of gold), the profit will be doubled after two handovers, resulting in a situation where the government makes money and farmers and businessmen lose money. If this continues, the revival of the silk cocoon industry will be very difficult.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Plans to Establish Shenyang Customs</h3>
<p>Part of the Northeast has been restored to order, and industry, commerce, import and export trade are also gradually becoming prosperous. In order to increase tax revenue, the Ministry of Finance will first establish Shenyang Customs, and establish branch customs in Changchun and Jin County. However, before September 18, Panyang did not have customs but was established in Dalian. Now Dalian is a free port. In terms of topography, Shenyang is located on the back of Dalian, so Dalian will not be established temporarily. There are also Binjiang, Yanji, and Andong in the Northeast. When the situation improves, they will all be established.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Yarn and Cloth Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Yarn and cloth prices in Tianjin have been strong recently. Although the Central Textile Bureau has sold off, it has not fallen. It is reported that after the Shanghai Textile Control Committee raised the price of yarn, fine yarn suddenly rose. Shanghai gangs came here to purchase because Tianjin yarn was cheaper, which caused the price here to be firm. Due to the shortage of cotton cloth in Zhangsui and other places, the demand is urgent in this cold winter, and the price of cloth has soared, which is 15,000 yuan higher than Tianjin per piece. Therefore, there are many merchants who travel back and forth. It is heard that more than 50 packages of Zhang cloth are transported every day.</p>
<h3>Current Situation of Serge is Depressed; Predictions for After the New Year are Good</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Recently, the prices of gold, white rice, cigarettes, silk cloth, kerosene, etc. have been rising continuously. Only Serge has not risen but fallen. The main reason is that in this port, those who are under pressure from high-interest loans and close their accounts have been heard every day. As the end of the year approaches, the silver root is tight, and banks and money shops are also closing down. Actual sales have become the end. American goods are pouring in, and those who buy out are numerous. People's hearts are weak. Mayerton's previous market price was prosperous all the way due to the delay in the issuance of the license. When a large number of peers arrived, the price gradually fell. Taking a comprehensive view of the market situation last month, it can be called a dull and tired situation, and American goods occupy a superior and important position in the current serge market. If all parties do not closely support and contact each other, it will be difficult for domestic goods to gain a foothold, and if high-interest loans are not eliminated, the business community will be in danger of bankruptcy. But in terms of the future of the serge industry, people in the industry predict that the market will definitely be good after the end of the Wanli period, because it is difficult to settle foreign exchange purchases, and it is not easy to apply for a license. It is bound to be a big shortage when ordering from foreign countries. The production of goods in this factory is affected by raw materials (because the import of wool is prohibited) and the payment of electricity, wages, donations and taxes. The cost is high and the output is bound to be small. Therefore, although the current price of serge is lower than the past peak, it is only a temporary phenomenon.</p>

<h3>Small Education Advancement Association Hosted Guests from All Circles Yesterday</h3>
<p>Demanding Assistance from the Press to Protect Professions</p>
<p>[This newspaper] The Shanghai Primary School Teachers' United Advancement Association hosted guests from all walks of life at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club yesterday to appeal for the protection of teachers' professions and to request assistance from the press. The association's chairman, Mr. Ge, reported that primary school teachers lead frugal lives and work hard. To fully realize the function of education, the primary task is to protect teachers' professions. The government has repeatedly issued clear orders, but recently a small number of primary schools in the city have terminated the employment of teachers without reason, which is contrary to the government's good intentions to protect teachers' professions. The association put forward concrete proposals, calling on society to pay attention: (1) Ask the education authorities to reiterate the laws on job protection. (3) Ask all school principals to jointly send letters of employment before the start of the semester, otherwise it will be regarded as renewal of employment. (3) The term of renewal is one academic year or three academic years. (4) Dismissing teachers must strictly comply with the laws and regulations of the Ministry of Education. It is said that the association is mostly composed of teachers from private primary schools, and the treatment of teachers is usually not bad.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Secondary School Friendship Association Hosted the Press Last Night, Appealing on Behalf of Teachers for the Living Issues They Face</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] The Municipal Secondary School Teachers' Friendship Association of this city invited the press of this city for a dinner at the New Life Club on Weihaiwei Road at 5 p.m. yesterday, with the aim of making connections and hoping that the press could give sympathy from time to time and make appeals in various ways. Because the association has stated that the current teachers' monthly salary of only about 250,000 yuan is really difficult to maintain a family life, it immediately requested assistance from the municipal government authorities, and Mayor Wu expressed great sympathy, but due to the shortage of the municipal treasury and restrictions on the cases of the council, it was beyond his ability to help. After months of consultation, there was no result.</p>
<p>Temporarily Tolerating Hunger and Cold Rather Than Going on Strike</p>
<p>Therefore, it was inevitable to convene a general meeting of representatives from various schools, and it was decided to go on strike from the 6th of this month, but in view of the importance of students' studies, the director was sincerely moved and willing to endure hunger and cold and not bear the sin of being a famous teacher, and immediately made a general request for leave. However, in the future, the association is still determined to use the spirit of the past to implement this request and to ensure the minimum living standards of colleagues. Their ultimate goal is to use the price index as a multiple of salaries, asking the government to treat secondary school teachers as technicians and raise their salaries to the highest standards. In addition, the association has recently suggested to the Municipal Council that a teacher welfare fund be levied on students starting next semester, but the Director of Education, Gu, advocates that it be changed to a "teacher academic advancement subsidy" and that the funds be borne by the municipal treasury, but it still needs to be approved by the Municipal Council.</p>
<p>Hoping That the Mayor's Promise Will Be Fulfilled</p>
<p>Regarding the distribution of 500,000 yuan in winter clothing subsidies, Mayor Wu stated that there must be a precedent to follow and that there must be concrete evidence, and that news reports are not sufficient to prove it. Now the association feels that the mayor's statement is not entirely true, because the Secondary School Association is not a clearing team and cannot transfer documents, so how can it obtain evidence, so they hope that Mayor Wu can fully sympathize with the hardships of public teachers and maintain his consistent style as a politician and fulfill this promise.</p>
<h3>The Ever-Victorious Army First Encountered Waterloo: Donghua Lost to the Mixed Team 5-2, the Mixed Team Led Two to One in the First Half; Cui Shifu Paid Two Million Yuan to Bid on the Charity Ball</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] The ever-victorious Donghua football team suffered its first crushing defeat in this charity match and the inter-port selection match, losing to the mixed team by one to five, with Donghua trailing one to two in the first half. Donghua's defense was weaker, and although the offense was fierce, the mixed team's steel gate was firmly defended, and the attacks were unsuccessful. There were an estimated five or six thousand spectators at the Yiyuan yesterday. The referee was Yue Xiurong, and the linesmen were He Chunhui and Chen Jixiang. During the break in the match, the charity ball was auctioned, and Cui Shifu, the president of the Longjie Sports Association, purchased it for a high price of two million yuan, and his benevolent and righteous act is commendable.</p>
<p>Defense Determines Victory or Defeat</p>
<p>The match began after the Nan Tong Orchestra finished playing "Under the Double Eagles Flag." Donghua, with six wins in six matches in the league, seemed to be facing the heroes with a newly crowned champion's posture. The cooperation of the whole team was tacit, and Han Longhai's speed was amazing. He built two miraculous achievements yesterday. Sun Jinshun's iron legs were still as good as ever. Although Donghua's offense was fierce, the mixed team's defense was strict. The two steel gates of goalkeepers McNitt and Dirati were invincible. When the iron legs met the steel gate, there was no way to break through. Yesterday's mixed team was full of talent. It was a charity match, and at the same time, it was a selection match for the inter-port representative team, so everyone showed off their skills and worked harder. Little Yellow Hair Robert Steev showed his heroic style as always. The victory or defeat yesterday was determined by the difference between the forwards of Donghua and the mixed team, while the defense of Donghua was far inferior to that of the mixed team, and there was no way to resist it. Mixed: McNitt (up), Dirati (down), Manyari, Steeb, Schoffer, Berni, Chen Xiaoping, Kapstein, Carlo Liech, Lei Shuping (down), Robert Stoff, Bao Jie (up), Zala. Donghua: Liu Xianhan, Li Ning (up), Zhuang Youren (down), Zhuang Youren (up), Lin Wenhu (down), Han Longbo, Tan Fuzhen, Yu Qiaoxing, Li Yao, Sun Jinshun, Dai Linjing (up), Han Longhai, Chen Mingzhe (down), Jia Youliang.</p>
<p>Donghua Fell in Five Minutes</p>
<p>As soon as the whistle blew, the match began. When the mixed team was just starting to cooperate and the communication was not yet skilled, Donghua's offense was frequent. Li Yao's first shot was slightly off and went out of bounds to the right. Then Youliang hooked the ball back from the bottom line, and Longhai dived and hooked a shot, which was also off to the right and missed. Donghua's entire army pushed forward, and the mixed team's Villa took the opportunity to bring the ball into the center. Carlo Liech caught it and kicked it hard, like a shooting star. Liu Xianhan stood on the right side of the goal in a horse-riding stance, but the ball entered from the left, and he could not save it and lost a city. It was only five minutes. The mixed team attacked again, and Yellow Hair flew the ball into the area and shot at the goal, slightly higher and hit the door frame and bounced back. The mixed generals crowded in, and Zhuang Youren calmly hooked the ball out while falling, turning danger into safety, which won a lot of applause. Donghua's generals were furious and led the three armies to cheer up and attack the mixed team's hinterland. Youliang shot twice, both of which were held by McNitt.</p>
<p>Tied and Then Fell Behind</p>
<p>Before long, Lin Gen sent a high ball from the rear, and Ade seemed to want to perform, leaped up in the air, and hooked the ball to Li Yao with his head, which was amazing. Li Yao caught it and kicked it hard, like a flat cannonball, flying straight to the left of the goal, but the steel gate McNitt, showing off not to let Linjing monopolize the front, flew forward and hugged the ball, showing it extremely wonderfully. At 25 minutes, Sun Iron Leg found a gap and passed it to Li Yao. He dribbled the ball straight in, and Longhai flew over and entered, tying the score at one each. Then the two sides fought fiercely and entered a mixed battle. At 40 minutes, Li Yao cut into the center, and McNitt rushed out and hugged the ball, running a few steps, and was judged to have hit the fence, and Iron Leg failed to take the penalty. Before the end of the first half, the ball turned around in front of Donghua's goal, and the generals of both sides were mixed into a group, fighting only to the point where people were turned upside down. The ball suddenly flew to the right, Kapstein's good opportunity came, and he looked around and found no one, pressed the ball down, described it accurately, and then built a success, and the first half was two to one, and Donghua fell behind.</p>
<p>Xianhan Went Backwards and Lost Four Chen</p>
<p>Changing sides and adjusting the generals to fight again, Dirati was transferred out of McNitt, and the mixed communication gradually began to take shape. At four minutes, Lei Shuping took the ball and advanced quickly along the side, passed it to Yellow Hair, crossed the two gates of Zhang and Zhuang, and kicked it in the air, slightly higher and hit the door frame and fell down. When Zhang Zhuang was welcoming, he touched it right, and confusedly bounced into the net, and gave another city back. At ten minutes, Yellow Hair got another ball from Youliang, just when the two guards Zhang and Zhuang were standing opposite, he brought the ball back, and flew his left foot, and hit the target again, four to one, Donghua lost four cities in a row, and the crowd was angry and launched a counterattack. Youliang Mingzhe, there were many attacks, Rati's business was booming, at fifteen minutes, Li Yao sent a corner kick, Chen Xiao Ping leaped up and topped it again and again, Hailong flew up and shot it, and was stopped by Rati, and then Youliang got the ball and cut it in, Hailong wanted to bloom on his head, but failed, hit the door frame and went out of bounds. At eighteen minutes, Berni passed the ball forward to Yellow Hair, and Lin Gen intercepted his path, Yellow Hair passed to the left, Villa's foot rose and the ball fell, flying into Donghua's net, five to one, the mixed team's world was set.</p>
<p>Not Willing to Take Back a City</p>
<p>Donghua was unwilling, and before long, Tie Zhui sent a high ball forward, and Rati rushed out to save the danger, Longhai was fast, and took the lead. He looked at an empty city, but his heart was high and the ball was also high, and it went over the door and out of bounds. Donghua continued to work hard. At 27 minutes, Hailong shot hard in front of the mixed team's goal. Rati did not defend this move, so he was attacked and scored, making it two to five. After that, the two sides attacked and defended each other. Donghua's five forwards advanced, but the mixed team's foreigners were strong and strong, and they did not win in the end. By the time the statutory time ended, the ever-victorious army was miserably attacked by the mixed team by two to five.</p>

<h3>Correction Letter</h3>
<p>(1) Regarding your newspaper's December 1st Bangkok special dispatch, the report on the severe restrictions on Siamese compatriots educating their children contained malicious attacks involving Ambassador Li. For example, it was said that he initially adopted a wait-and-see attitude. In fact, Ambassador Li presented his credentials on September 17th and convened a symposium on overseas Chinese education issues on the 19th. Subsequently, the Education Association and various school principals submitted written opinions. Ambassador Li immediately used these as a basis for negotiations with the Siamese Foreign Minister. The Siamese Foreign Ministry agreed that the Director of the Ministry of Education's Department of Public Education and the First Secretary of the Cultural Affairs Section of the Embassy, Ouyang Chun, would discuss the details. All of this is verifiable with local newspapers and archives. Furthermore, the claim that he continued to tour seaside resorts and refused to meet with representatives of the overseas Chinese community is also fabricated. Ambassador Li has been in office for more than three months and has not even visited the old capital, Ayutthaya, which is only a two-hour journey away. In Bangkok, foreign envoys often drive to the seaside for weekend relaxation, but Ambassador Li, due to busy official duties, continues to work on Sundays and has not had a single weekend of seaside rest. Local newspapers here record Ambassador Li's words and deeds daily. Please check all Bangkok newspapers to see if there is any news of Ambassador Li visiting seaside resorts. As for refusing to meet with representatives, this is even more unfounded. Ambassador Li has stipulated that he will receive guests on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoons, and it can be said that he does not refuse anyone who comes. The fact that your newspaper's reporter made such a statement is clearly intended to slander and frame. The report claimed that public opinion was critical, the overseas Chinese community was indignant, and telegrams were sent to the central government requesting that it order a forceful assertion of their rights, but it is unknown on what basis this claim is made. We hereby request that you investigate and correct this matter. The Embassy of the Republic of China in Siam (December 28th, Year 35) (2) Upon reviewing your newspaper's December 1st, Year 35 publication regarding the alleged neglect of the Chinese education issue by our Embassy in Siam, which supposedly caused great dissatisfaction among the overseas Chinese community and drew criticism from public opinion, we find that this does not align with the facts. Since his arrival, Ambassador Li has been deeply concerned about Chinese education. On the third day after presenting his credentials, he convened an education symposium to solicit opinions from all parties. He then proposed flexible measures to the Siamese government to resolve the Chinese education issue. Subsequently, due to the Siamese side's delay in responding, he sent three official notes to the Siamese government urging a reply. Because the Chinese schools greatly valued Ambassador Li's attention to this issue and his efforts in negotiations, they expressed trust in him. Therefore, when the Siamese authorities recently forcibly ordered registration according to the old regulations, the responsible persons of various schools gathered at the embassy and unanimously decided to support the embassy in order to achieve the goal of revising the regulations to benefit Chinese education. There were never any direct telegrams to the government expressing dissatisfaction. As the report contains information that is inconsistent with the facts, we are writing to request a correction. Representatives: Li Zhengyuan of the Zhonghua Pingmin School, Chen Zeyi of the Lianyi School, Wang Xuehua of the Sanmin Gongxue, Lin Huijun of the Shude Girls' School, Zhi Xiong of the Qingnian Gongxue, and Li Zhihong and others from Qixin and 49 other schools.</p>

<h3>New York's Year-End Scene: The Heart of the World Beats Faster, "New Yorkers" Are Exhausted. Prediction: The City's Population Will Exceed Ten Million in Five Years.</h3>
<p>— New York Airmail Dispatch, December 25th. Our Correspondent in the United States, Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>On the afternoon of three days before Christmas, snowflakes fluttered all over New York. A cold wind swept across the city from the Hudson River, stirring the mottled fallen leaves on both sides of the road. The silver-white world brought novelty to "New Yorkers" and a sense of the New Year.</p>
<p>American children, wearing bright red velvet clothes, skied, skated, and had snowball fights everywhere. Middle-aged and elderly people did not huddle up because of the "first snow." On the contrary, because of the holidays, people seemed even busier.</p>
<p>Busy with Gifts: Post Office Opens Day and Night Shifts</p>
<p>Radio stations constantly broadcast Christmas gift advertisements. Clever merchants turned everything into "holiday gifts." Pajamas for five dollars a set, nylon stockings for one and a half dollars a pair, and chocolate candies for eighty-five cents a box were wrapped in shiny red and green paper and placed in mailing boxes for gifts. The post office opened day and night shifts, hired temporary staff, and in front of the package windows, there was a long line of people. They only needed to pay postage of twenty or thirty cents to safely deliver a large package of holiday gifts to their relatives' homes.</p>
<p>In a capitalist society, everything is a commodity, and commodities become tools for gift-giving. Cultural enterprises are no exception. "Reader's Digest" placed large advertisements in theaters and newspapers, saying, "The most ideal gift for the New Year is a subscription to Reader's Digest for the whole year." Many women's and family magazines designed various inexpensive, beautiful, and pleasing gifts for thousands of housewives.</p>
<p>The intersection of Broadway and 34th Street is like the corner of Nanjing Road and Xizang Road in Shanghai. There are three of New York's largest department stores: "Macy's," "Saks," and "Gimbels." The escalator-style elevators, like those in the Great Sun Department Store, were crowded with people going up and down. Countless goods, including clothing, food, daily necessities, and toys for children, and countless banknotes were constantly flying around. Most of the customers were housewives, but there were also many elderly ladies in their seventies and eighties, wearing tens of thousands of styles of hats, none of which were exactly the same, and wearing clothes of different colors, weaving through the crowds. God created Christmas with deep meaning, and he must have seen those devout "common people" and smiled.</p>
<p>Times Square: Filled with Red Lights and Green Wine</p>
<p>Santa Claus came to this largest city in the world very early. In Greater New York, hundreds of thousands of glass windows were decorated with "Santa Claus." In Times Square, the gospel of Santa Claus, broadcast by loudspeakers, poured into the ears of the crowds of pedestrians. This small area is always back-to-back and shoulder-to-shoulder from morning until three or four in the morning. Even on snowy nights, it is still bustling. Many young girls from rural America, as soon as they step into New York, find a policeman and ask: "Excuse me, can you tell me how to get to Times Square?"</p>
<p>They mostly meet drunken sailors in Times Square (also translated as Times Square), and sailors' music is broadcast in every corner of the bar. A nickel is inserted into the coin-operated jukebox, and five minutes of decadent music can be enjoyed. Whiskey, sherry, cognac... wine is the lifeblood of American children. The smell of wine, rouge, and perfume is mixed together.</p>
<p>Airship Reflecting Snow: A Spectacular Sight in the Sky</p>
<p>Colorful neon lights illuminate the city day and night. Advertisements for cold drinks in the summer still flash in a corner of Times Square. The electric news reports in the New York Times are several hours faster than reading the next day's newspaper. The street cartoons often attract newly arrived tourists who stop to watch.</p>
<p>The war is over, and airships have become the best advertising tool for department stores. At night, the airships carry electric light advertisements for Christmas gifts and slowly circle in the sky above Times Square. On snowy nights, the lights of the airship, reflecting the snowy scenery, become a spectacular sight in the sky.</p>
<p>Coal Mine Strike: New York Orders Power Conservation</p>
<p>The person New Yorkers fear the most is probably coal miner John L. Lewis. When New Yorkers talk about Lewis and his thick eyebrows, they have a bit of a "talk-tiger-turns-pale" expression. No one can control the neon lights of the New York Times, but with just one word from Lewis, those neon lights go out. Last month, Lewis suddenly ordered 400,000 coal miners to strike. New York Mayor O'Dwyer immediately ordered electricity conservation. Neon lights were all "dimmed." Times Square was dark for two or three weeks. The mayor's order was to save coal to resist Lewis's strike in the long term. Two companies secretly turned on their advertising lights and were severely fined by the city government.</p>
<p>The day Lewis ordered the workers to return to work, many New York businessmen jumped for joy. When businessmen are happy, New York society seems to come alive. The business community is paramount in a commercial society, and the business community is the backbone of society.</p>
<p>Population Soars: The City Center Cannot Accommodate It Well</p>
<p>The prosperity that the war brought to the United States cannot be calculated in numbers. The population of New York is about to exceed eight million. The original urban form of New York is already showing signs of being unable to accommodate it. Let's not even talk about the serious "housing shortage." The traffic rules alone have already given the city government a headache. The United States is the "mother's home" of the automobile industry. It is unknown how many millions of cars there are in New York City. Therefore, marching and parking have become problems. More than three months ago, the mayor ordered that parking on the side of the road be absolutely prohibited in the city center, from 23rd Street to 59th Street, except on Saturday evenings and Sundays. Many people broke the law and were fined fifteen dollars.</p>
<p>New Plan: Building Underground Parking Lots</p>
<p>As a result, many car owners would rather lock up their cars and not use them. The subway trains, from early morning to evening, from dusk to the next day's dawn, are always crowded like sardines. The few parking lots in the city center, like stars in the morning sky, charge seventy-five cents for an hour of parking, but they are always full of cars. Two months ago, Mayor O'Dwyer took a trip to San Francisco and was very impressed with the "underground parking lots" there. When he returned, he decided to build three large-scale underground parking lots in New York, each capable of parking 20,000 cars at the same time. However, the plan is in place, but "we hear the sound of footsteps on the stairs, but no one comes down!"</p>
<p>Drive Carefully: Radio Broadcasts on Snowy Nights</p>
<p>Traffic in Shanghai is a problem; traffic control in New York is an even bigger problem. Although the signals of the traffic lights are so clear, car accidents are almost unavoidable at any time. Americans are naturally impatient. Even though there is a red light ahead, many cars still try to run it, and pedestrians try to run it. In Washington, the city government has a regulation that if you cross the street at a red light, you must be fined ten dollars. But in New York, the more you can cross under a red light, the more you are a "hero" who can get things done. People who drive cars in New York honk their horns at every turn. Sometimes, when a long line of cars is moving, and the first car stops, the horns behind it sound like a road music concert. These situations are absolutely not seen in England or France. "America is too young a country," many middle-aged or elderly people who have come from Europe exclaim!</p>
<p>Everyone is busy at the end of the year, and those who are already impatient are inevitably even more so. The snow three days before Christmas further hindered their scheduled transportation. At LaGuardia Airport, one hundred and thirteen civil aviation planes could not take off due to heavy snow. Many people who had originally planned to spend Christmas in Miami or Los Angeles temporarily changed their plans. Trains in New York were at least an hour late because of the snow, so they were all running slowly. The city government's traffic officer said so euphemistically: "Be careful of the snow under your wheels. There are already two inches of snow in New York City! In Upper New York (i.e., upstate New York), there are up to eight inches. The snow is so slippery, quickly reduce your speed, slowly, slowly. Even so, you will be an hour late, but isn't safety more important?"</p>
<p>However, the next day was finally revealed. Overnight, there were a total of twenty-six car crashes and rollovers in Greater New York City due to snow.</p>
<p>Queue for Tickets: Long Enough to Circle Several Blocks</p>
<p>The reporter also originally planned to drive to the Virginia coast to spend Christmas, but the snow hindered our plan.</p>
<p>Spending the New Year in New York is lonely. Many people who make a living in New York return to their hometowns for the holidays. But on the other hand, the New Year in New York is also lively. Around Christmas, theaters are packed every night. It is harder to buy tickets for the small-scale opera house than anything else. Several small theaters around Times Square are showing popular new films: "Newlyweds and Widows," "Dear Clementine," and the cartoon "Song of the South," etc. Every show is crowded. The world's largest movie theater, "Radio City Music Hall," in addition to showing movies, is also staging this year's greatest Christmas song and dance performance. The queue for tickets is long enough to circle several blocks, not only on Sundays but also on Mondays and Tuesdays. The actress Ingrid Bergman, who is frantically worshiped by American society, was recently hired from Los Angeles to New York for a large sum of money to perform in a play at a theater. It is said that the tickets for reservations have already been sold out until February of next year.</p>
<p>The World's Capital Will Take Shape in New York</p>
<p>The world's largest city is crowded with the world's largest scenes. At the end of the year, the city government is also undergoing renovations. Many people hate trams because they are too dirty and noisy. Now many have been cancelled. New-style red and yellow public buses parade along Broadway. In the middle of the discussion about moving the United Nations capital away from New York, New Yorkers felt a bit "slowed down" and "lost face." Mayor O'Dwyer tightly held onto the big financier Rockefeller, the grandson of the oil tycoon, who generously donated eight and a half million dollars to the United Nations to buy land along the East River, saying that a future world capital will be built in the most prosperous area in the world - Manhattan. "In five years, the population of New York will definitely exceed ten million," I saw a small newspaper predict this.</p>
<p>Delegations from Various Countries Move into Buildings One After Another</p>
<p>At the end of the year, delegations from various countries stationed at the United Nations are busy moving. The United States government, in order to make it easier for delegations from various countries to gather and do business, has specially allocated the 63rd, 64th, and 65th floors of the "skyscraper" as New York's "East Legation Quarter." The Chinese delegation has reserved 7,500 square feet of land on the 63rd floor, with a monthly rent of $7,000. It is said that the British delegation has rented 20,000 square feet, and their layout and grandeur are certainly more spectacular.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, New York is now the heart of the world, and the pulse of the heart every minute and every second affects the dynamics of the whole world. 1946 will soon be over. The eight million New Yorkers are looking forward to a more prosperous, more stable, and wealthier 1947! (Posted on Christmas Eve)</p>

<h3>Three Major Problems in Sichuan: Corruption, Opium, and Bandits</h3>
<p>Airmail dispatch December 27th. Our correspondent in Chengdu, Zhou Xueduan</p>
<p>The weather is cold, the wind is freezing, and the end of the year is near! After continuous winter rains, the climate in Chengdu is even colder. These few days, the Sichuan Provincial Assembly is holding its third conference. In a corner of the cold wind, councilors from various counties brought the mournful voices of 50 million people in Sichuan. From these voices, we hear the gloomy, turbid, and unstable social melodies of Sichuan in recent years. This is like a cold current that further lowers the cruel atmosphere of the Sichuan climate.</p>
<p>This year is the year of demobilization. Sichuan, after eight years of war, is striving for stability and restoration amidst extreme turmoil. However, this year, the provincial government's focus has been on the planning and promotion of construction in recent years. In addition, the civil unrest has not yet ended, the flames of war have not ceased, and the national order has not been fully stabilized. The basic order of Sichuan society has not been stabilized and restored. The proceedings of the Provincial Assembly in the past few days included policy reports by the Acting Chairman of the Provincial Government, Bu Xixia, and the heads of various departments, as well as inquiries from the councilors. From the reports, we can indeed see the various political progresses in Sichuan in recent years. From the inquiries, we can see the various malpractices in Sichuan society. Due to these two contradictory comparisons, the reporter feels that there is still a disconnect between the current government and society in Sichuan, which reflects the general situation of chaos and instability in Sichuan society.</p>
<p>Eliminating Corruption and Rectifying Political Ethics</p>
<p>At the opening of the Provincial Assembly, Councilor Zeng Shengzhai, who is in his seventies, made a poignant speech, pointing out that the three most serious problems in Sichuan today are opium, bandits, and corruption. The current social phenomena in Sichuan are bandits everywhere, the people are not living, bribery is rampant, corruption is prevalent, and opium is rampant. In the eastern counties of Sichuan, not only opium is everywhere, but also heroin, morphine, and sosso are everywhere. The first priority is to clarify official governance and eliminate corruption. Regarding the rectification of political ethics and corruption cases, the councilors' inquiries were the most intense. The head of civil affairs, Chen Kaisai, was the first to bear the brunt. Corruption by county magistrates has long been regarded as commonplace in Sichuan. After the cases occur, the provincial government only issues a document to transfer them, which is the most dissatisfied with the whole province. For example, in the remote and poor Ma'ai Governing Bureau in Sichuan Province, the first Director, Li Weile, recently embezzled more than 6.77 million yuan in fraudulently claimed salaries for staff, more than 650 dan of rice and yellow millet, more than 1,100 dan of illegally collected land taxes, and embezzled more than 26 million yuan in township savings alliance victory public bond donations, deed taxes, and soldiers' family settlement expenses. He also contributed more than 1,000 dan of grain externally. He is now being transferred to Mochuan. However, he is still being detained by local people. Another example is the embezzlement of special project funds by the former Hejiang County Magistrate, which amounted to hundreds of millions. Months after the case occurred, there is still no news. Other corruption cases are numerous, and it has never been heard that the government has taken thorough action. Furthermore, regarding the issue of political ethics, the county magistrate should set an example for the county and should be cautious in his conduct. The councilors exposed the scandalous affairs of two current county magistrates. One is Zeng Zhongcheng, the county magistrate of Kaixian, because his fiancée was too scandalous in the local area, causing him to be uneasy in his post. The other is Huang Xilian, the county magistrate of Neijiang, because he had a dispute with his wife, which resulted in head injuries and a city-wide scandal. Another example is the county magistrates arbitrarily disregarding human lives. For example, Li Caigui, the county magistrate of Gusong, wrongly killed three innocent young people, treating the people like rags, which aroused public outrage throughout the county. This series of examples illustrates the corruption of political ethics and the prevalence of corruption in Sichuan today. Regarding finance, the fiscal system of Sichuan Province was reformed this year, and most of the direct taxes were assigned to the local governments. The new tax bureaus in various counties are extremely large, and tax collection is inevitably prone to malpractices. The councilors asked the Director of the Finance Department, Deng Hanxiang, to show his conscience and guarantee that tax officials would not engage in corruption. Director Deng simply replied: "I can only guarantee myself." Inquiries on civil affairs and finance occupied two days of the conference, with more than sixty inquiries, mainly involving corruption and political ethics. The general councilors agreed that the current promotion of public administration in Sichuan depends on the thorough clarification of official governance and the rectification of official conduct. In addition to providing facts about corruption, they unanimously hoped that the government's selection, appointment, assessment, reward, and dismissal of county magistrates could have legal standards. The emoluments for county magistrates should have a real guarantee. However, most importantly, thorough and strict law enforcement should be continued for corruption. This is the most urgent appeal and demand of the people of Sichuan today.</p>
<p>Nothing is More Urgent Than Security</p>
<p>The councilors from various counties, based on their personal experiences, made urgent appeals regarding the issue of security in Sichuan after demobilization. Some even wept and reported with tears in their eyes. The current security situation in Sichuan is caused by the rampant banditry. Large and small gangs of bandits appear and disappear without a fixed location. Carjacking and field robberies are commonplace. Those with more than a thousand guns include the giant bandit Hu Guoguang in the fifth district, the giant bandit Qu Baijie in the eighth district, the giant bandit Ling Boqing in the fourteenth district, and the giant bandit Ma Shiyi in the sixteenth district. They gather in the mountains and forests, run rampant in the countryside, and have been a scourge for years, but have not yet been suppressed. How can the Security Department justify itself? The second is the military discipline of the security forces. The councilors pointed out that the security teams in various places often use their power to harass the people, and even harbor opium, collude with local evil forces, and commit evil deeds. Before ensuring security, they disturb the people. Has the government paid attention to this harm? Councilor Wang Baomin even wept and begged Acting Chairman Deng and Wang Yuanhui, Director of the Security Department, to have the bodhisattva's heart of saving people and the world, and to quickly stabilize security and relieve the people.</p>
<p>In his reply, Director Wang Yuanhui reported on the "achievements" of this year's suppression of bandits throughout Sichuan. He said that 93 major and minor bandit leaders had been killed or captured this year, 1,540 bandits had been captured, 410 guns had been seized, including machine guns and rifles, and 168 kidnapped people had been rescued. Under the instructions of Chairman Deng, a general encirclement and suppression is currently being carried out throughout Sichuan, and it is certain that the banditry in Sichuan can be gradually eliminated soon.</p>
<p>The people of Sichuan, after eight years of hardship and suffering in the war of resistance, are most urgently in need of stability and rest. This is the unanimous opinion of the councilors. However, the biggest obstacle to social stability is the rampant banditry, which causes extreme social unrest and extreme insecurity for the people. It is also the biggest scourge in Sichuan today. "Eliminating bandits and stabilizing society," "Nothing is more urgent than security." This is the unanimous call of 50 million people in Sichuan.</p>
<p>The Spread of Opium Throughout Sichuan</p>
<p>Another malpractice that is poisoning Sichuan society in parallel with bandits is opium. Originally, the government had planned to completely ban opium in Sichuan in the next two years. At the same time, the promotion of the opium ban this year has been spared no effort. However, those who ban ban, and those who violate violate. The councilors unanimously lamented that the law is too lenient for the opium ban. The Director of the Opium Prohibition Department reported on the achievements of this year's opium ban at the Assembly, pointing out that this year, 31,000 mu of opium seedlings have been eradicated in the Songli Maowen area in southwest Sichuan and the Pingwu Qingchuan area in northern Sichuan, and more than 10,000 opium offenders have been arrested. However, opium is still lurking and spreading everywhere.</p>
<p>The councilors came from various counties and reported on the spread of opium in various villages and towns, especially the tolerance and indulgence of special evil forces. They gnashed their teeth with hatred. The councilors from northern Sichuan pointed out that the amount of opium planted by force in Wangcang can be ranked first in the country. The councilors from eastern Sichuan pointed out that the morphine smuggled in by ships entering Sichuan and the originally popular opium are rampant in every corner, making eastern Sichuan almost a poisoned world today. In addition to the government's determination to completely ban opium, are there any effective measures to prevent the harboring of evil forces?</p>
<p>Sichuan society is already fragmented and unbearable in the midst of chaos. How can it be poisoned again? The councilors, on behalf of the people of Sichuan, issued an earnest and painful appeal.</p>
<p>Combining the voices issued by the councilors on behalf of the people of Sichuan, it is believed that "nothing is more urgent than stability" in Sichuan today. Let the people live and work in peace. Although the construction plans advocated by the authorities are far-sighted and magnificent, it seems that they should address the urgent needs. First, thoroughly clarify and eradicate the three major problems in Sichuan today - corruption, bandits, and opium - so that Sichuan can seek progress and gradually develop after social stability. Otherwise, the cold current of the three problems will make the spring of the people of Sichuan come late. This is the call of the representatives of the people of Sichuan and the unanimous urgent demand of 50 million people throughout Sichuan.</p>

<h3>The Future of Taiwan's Hydroelectric Power Industry</h3>
<p>— Mao Ronglin</p>
<p>Taiwan Island is one of the two largest islands in southeastern China, located between 120 and 121 degrees east longitude and 22 to 25.5 degrees north latitude. It faces Fujian Province across the sea, less than 100 miles away. It has an area of 35,847 square kilometers and a coastline of 9,440 kilometers, with a Han Chinese population of 4,734,000. The indigenous population (including "raw" and "heated" aborigines) numbers 148,000. Originally our country's territory, Han people migrated there during the Tang and Song dynasties. In the late Ming dynasty, when Zheng Chenggong occupied Taiwan to resist the Qing dynasty, even more people from the southeast settled there. After the Qing dynasty unified the island, it was initially changed to Taiwan Prefecture, under the jurisdiction of Fujian Province, and later changed to Taiwan Province. Even today, people from Fujian and Guangdong still account for more than 90% of Taiwan's population. After China's defeat in the Sino-Japanese War in 1895, Taiwan was ceded to Japan. After 50 years of Japanese management, the value of production in 1937 reached 310 million Japanese yen, more than doubling the 147 million Japanese yen in 1928. Compared to the income of only one million yuan when it was part of our country, it increased several hundredfold. Since the July 7th Incident, Japan's southward expansion policy has gradually been completed. To meet its military needs, it has more actively developed Taiwan's resources. In the past eight years, Taiwan's hydroelectric power industry and industrial and mining construction have made achievements and are quite large in scale. Not only is the former Taiwan far behind, but it has also jumped to an important position in today's southeastern maritime national defense economic zone. Last September, Japan surrendered unconditionally, and Taiwan returned to the embrace of the motherland under our country's victory. From now on, its mission is not only to be a barrier for the southeastern coastal provinces of our country, a hub for naval and air forces in the north and south, but also a base for establishing permanent peace in the Pacific. How can we allow ourselves to ignore it any longer?</p>
<p>During the Japanese rule of Taiwan, its economic policy was entirely colonial in nature, only encouraging Taiwanese to work hard to produce large quantities of rice, sugar, tea, and fruit to supply the needs of the Japanese mainland. It imported its mainland's surplus industrial products, such as fertilizers, textiles, and other manufactured goods, to Taiwan in order to extract huge profits. After the July 7th Incident, as Taiwan became a naval and air base, it actively developed military industries. Therefore, its economic policy also changed to a strategic one. Factories such as aluminum refining, oil refining, calcium carbide, steel, alloys, rubber, alcohol, and shipbuilding were all resolutely established and expanded as much as possible, flourishing like bamboo shoots after a rain. As for the production of coal, gold, steel, and other mines, a foundation had already been laid before the war, and it was further expanded during the war. All these rapid advances related to military industries relied on the development and supply of power resources. Therefore, Japan spared no effort in surveying and developing Taiwan's water resources. According to the report of the Taiwan Power Company, Taiwan's water resources can be developed up to more than 3 million kilowatts, of which at least 2 million kilowatts can be economically utilized. The Japanese government had a ten-year plan to develop 1 million kilowatts, which began in 1932. The core of this plan was the Dajia River project, which had the largest scale, with a total of eight power plants and a generating capacity of 450,000 kilowatts. Three of these were already under construction. In addition, the Taiwan Power Company was organized to uniformly manage Taiwan's power industry in order to achieve the government's control goals. The company's capital of 300 million Japanese yen was a joint venture between the government and private businesses, with the Taiwan Governor-General's Office contributing one-eighth of the capital, and the rest from private businesses. However, the right to operate was entirely controlled by the Japanese government. The president, vice president, and directors were all appointed by the Governor-General, and the operating policies were also stipulated by the Japanese government. In terms of equipment, there were 34 completed power plants throughout Taiwan, with a total installed generating capacity of approximately 320,000 kilowatts, including 26 hydroelectric power plants of various sizes, with a total generating capacity of approximately 270,000 kilowatts. The largest of these was the first Sun Moon Lake plant, which had a generating capacity of 100,000 kilowatts and was completed in 1934. There were eight thermal power plants, with a total of approximately 50,000 kilowatts, the largest of which was the northern Dalin power plant, used to supplement power during the dry season and for temporary emergencies.</p>
<p>After 1941, the Japanese government more actively developed Taiwan's water resources. There were nine projects under construction, with a total installed generating capacity of approximately 270,000 kilowatts. Among these, three projects were mostly completed, with a total generating capacity of 110,000 kilowatts. Towards the end of the war, starting in October 1944, the U.S. Air Force repeatedly bombed the first and second power plants at Sun Moon Lake, causing damage. The bombing was most severe in April 1945, completely destroying all the auxiliary substations and slightly affecting the water pipelines. Fortunately, the power plants themselves suffered little damage, and all the machines were intact. The eastern Xikou power plant was also destroyed by bombing. In addition, secondary substations and wheel power distribution equipment in various places were damaged. Although they could still maintain power generation after repairs, the capacity was greatly reduced. In the summers and autumns of 1944 and 1945, Taiwan was hit by typhoons, followed by widespread landslides. The Wushe, Tiansongbei, and Wanda power plants in the west were all damaged. The eight large and small hydroelectric power plants in the east were also severely hit. The riverbeds were filled with sand and gravel, reaching as high as 16 meters, and almost all were destroyed. When we victoriously took over, Taiwan's power supply capacity had been reduced to only 42,000 kilowatts, barely one-tenth of the generating capacity during peacetime. This was the main reason.</p>
<p>After Taiwan's restoration, our government immediately began the takeover. First, the Taiwan Electricity Supervision Committee was organized, with Liu Jin-yu as the chairman and Huang Hui as the vice chairman. On November 9, 1945, supervision began. The important measures were as follows: (1) Strictly supervise employees to rush to repair the damaged projects day and night, and temporarily move the transformers with lighter loads to Sun Moon Lake to cope with the current power supply to factories throughout the province, while reducing thermal power generation to save coal consumption in Taiwan. (2) Improve the power distribution equipment in various counties and cities to ensure the safety of power supply. (3) Compile restoration and expansion plans for hydroelectric power. The restoration aspect is divided into two phases: the first phase is to increase from 42,000 kilowatts to 100,000 kilowatts, to be completed within three months; the second phase is to increase from 100,000 kilowatts to 200,000 kilowatts, to be completed within one year. The expansion aspect is also divided into two phases: the first phase is to expand 100,000 kilowatts, and the total generating capacity will be 300,000 kilowatts after completion, to be completed within three years; the second phase is to expand 200,000 kilowatts, and the total generating capacity will be 500,000 kilowatts after completion, to be completed within five years. Currently, the first phase of the restoration plan has been completed as scheduled, and a part of the second phase has also been completed. The total power generation has reached more than 180,000 kilowatts, exceeding the current needs of various factories. After all repairs are completed in the future, it will be sufficient to supply power to all factories before the war. As for the expansion plan, it is currently in the preparation stage of design and drawing. (4) Select outstanding Taiwanese employees, establish Mandarin tutoring classes, and conduct various professional training to cultivate cadres and achieve the goal of recruiting local talent. (5) Because the projects on the Dajia River were suspended, and the power plants in the east were shut down, many of the original employees were idle. After reorganization, more than 800 people were laid off, and more than 1,100 Japanese employees were dismissed to save expenses and increase work efficiency. (6) Control finances, strictly implement budgets and final accounts, clear accounts, and determine equity so that financial administration gradually gets on the right track.</p>
<p>On March 20, 1946, it was ordered to be renamed the Taiwan Electricity Takeover Committee to carry out further takeover work. During this period, the Takeover Committee took the following measures: (1) Recruit talent from within the country and Taiwan Province to assume important positions, so that the technical and business aspects can continue to develop without interruption. (2) Carefully retain Japanese technical employees, encourage them with service ethics, treat them equally, and allow them to work with peace of mind. (3) The factories and offices are scattered in various places, and the security is unstable, with thefts occurring from time to time. Entrust the police department to train police officers and establish a guard team to be dispatched to various places to maintain protection. (4) Plan to continue the construction of the unfinished civil engineering part of the Wulai Hydroelectric Power Plant. (5) Electrical equipment in Taiwan Province was mostly hidden or smuggled out after the restoration, and it was difficult to replenish, which greatly affected the power industry. Therefore, a request was submitted to the Governor-General's Office to work with relevant parties to strictly prohibit the export of metal equipment and electrical materials to remedy the situation.</p>
<p>In April 1946, the Takeover Committee was established. Director Qian Changzhao of the Resources Commission came to Taiwan and discussed the operating principles with Governor Chen Yi of the Province. A board of directors was organized, with Director Chen Zhongxi of the Power Industry Department of the Resources Commission as the chairman, and Director Liu Jin-yu was appointed as the acting general manager, and Directors Huang Hui and Liu Deyu as acting assistant managers. On May 1, 1946, it was ordered to establish the Taiwan Power Company (referred to as Taiwan Power Company) first. Under the general manager and assistant manager, there are seven departments: mechanical and electrical, civil engineering, planning, general affairs, business, management, and accounting. The original twelve branch offices throughout Taiwan were reorganized into district offices. The power plants, substations, repair shops, and electrical meter testing laboratories and high-voltage testing laboratories were still established. The heads of each department and the supervisors of each unit were also appointed one after another, and the personnel gradually became sound.</p>
<p>In terms of engineering, the focus is on actively repairing the equipment damaged during the war. Therefore, the first task is to repair the Sun Moon Lake Hydroelectric Power Plant, with the goal of achieving a generating capacity of 200,000 kilowatts by the end of this year. In addition, we are contacting foreign countries to purchase prize transformers and switch equipment to strengthen transmission capacity. As for the expansion, the Wulai Hydroelectric Power Plant Engineering Office was established first to continue construction and build the unfinished parts of the project.</p>
<p>In terms of business, because the cost of repairs is huge and prices are rising, in order to balance revenue and expenditure and maintain power supply operations, it is necessary to slightly adjust electricity prices. At the same time, the district offices are urged to strengthen the collection, meter reading, management, and contracting shops to make it convenient for users and increase revenue, which can be parallel and not contradictory.</p>
<p>In the past, materials were imported from Japan. In the future, Taiwan Province must be self-sufficient. This is the goal of developing Taiwan Province's economy in the future. Therefore, the operation and development of various agricultural, industrial, and mining products such as chemical fertilizers, oil refining, steelmaking, shipbuilding, sugar manufacturing, papermaking, salt making, cement, calcium carbide, and coal, gold, and copper all require a large supply of electricity. For example, the electrolytic production of one ton of ammonium sulfate fertilizer requires 3,600 kilowatt-hours of electricity (one degree equals one kilowatt-hour), one ton of calcium carbide requires 3,500 kilowatt-hours of electricity, and one ton of caustic soda requires 3,400 kilowatt-hours of electricity. In addition, sugar production, which had a maximum annual output of 1.4 million tons in the past, requires 74,600 kilowatts (equivalent to 100,000 horsepower) of electricity. In addition, rural electrification irrigation projects, city trams, and railway electrification all require a large amount of electricity. Preliminary estimates by experts believe that the total power generation in Taiwan must reach at least 300,000 kilowatts within three years, and at least 500,000 kilowatts within five years, to meet the needs of Taiwan Province's industrialization [see the attached table of estimated power needs in Taiwan Province's five-year construction plan]. Therefore, the promotion of Taiwan Province's hydroelectric power industry in the future must be gradually expanded based on this principle, hoping to achieve the above figures as scheduled. The following is a summary of the future expansion plan:</p>
<p>(1) Complete the Wulai, Tianleng, Wushe, and Sanshui hydroelectric power projects:</p>
<p>(1) Wulai Hydroelectric Power Plant Project—95% of the civil engineering part of the project has been completed, and a 12,500-kilowatt turbine generator set has been shipped and is expected to be installed and put into operation within six months.</p>
<p>(2) Tianleng Hydroelectric Power Plant Project—This project is one of the Dajia River plans. 70% of the civil engineering part has been completed. It is planned to complete all the civil engineering by the end of 1947, and two 26,000-kilowatt turbine generator sets have been ordered from the United States for installation and power supply.</p>
<p>(3) Wushe Hydroelectric Power Plant Project—The plant building and power generation equipment of this project have been fully completed, and 70% of the water channel has also been completed. However, only 5% of the reservoir dam has been completed. It is planned to continue construction to completion to prepare for power generation.</p>
<p>(2) Add the Nanshi, Zhudong, Fengyuan, and Meiji four hydroelectric power plants:</p>
<p>(1) Nanshi Hydroelectric Power Plant Project—This project is located in the upper reaches of the Nanshi River in Taipei County, with a drop of 130 meters. The planned power generation capacity is 20,000 kilowatts. The transportation road has been mostly completed, and it is planned to complete the entire project and supply power within three years.</p>
<p>(2) Zhudong Hydroelectric Power Plant Project—This project is located in the Touqian River in Hsinchu County, with a drop of 224 meters. The planned power generation capacity is 21,000 kilowatts. The preliminary design has been completed, and it is planned to complete the construction and supply power within four years.</p>
<p>(3) Fengyuan No. 1 Hydroelectric Power Plant Project—This project is one of the Dajia River plans, with a drop of 105 meters. The planned power generation capacity is 51,200 kilowatts. A part of the transverse pit of the tunnel has been excavated, and it is planned to complete all of it and supply power within four years.</p>
<p>(4) Meiji Hydroelectric Power Plant Project—This project is also one of the Dajia River plans, with a drop of 174 meters. The planned power generation capacity is 71,000 kilowatts. A part of the preparatory work for each project has been completed, and the tunnel pit has also started construction. It is planned to complete all of it and supply power within five years.</p>
<p>(3) Expand the Northern Thermal Power Plant</p>
<p>Taiwan's hydroelectric power generation, due to terrain and rainfall, requires considerable supplementation and regulation from thermal power generation. Based on past experience, the various large and small thermal power plants must be fired up to supply power for an average of four months each year. It is planned to add a 35,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator in the northern thermal power plant to prevent power interruptions during the dry season throughout Taiwan. The estimated cost for this project is two and a half years.</p>
<p>According to the prices in January 1946, the above plan estimates that the restoration part will require US$4 million and NT$86.4 million; the expansion part will require US$10 million and NT$2 billion. It is hoped that the government and the people will actively invest and jointly embark on this grand undertaking.</p>
<p>Taiwan's location straddles both temperate and tropical zones, with a mild climate and abundant products. In addition to an annual rice production of 8 million dan (a unit of dry measure), there are also large quantities of sugarcane, camphor, tea, and mineral resources such as coal, copper, and aluminum. It also has abundant water resources, which are sufficient for the future electrification of the entire island's industry. Before the war, under Japanese rule, 400,000 to 500,000 kilowatts had been gradually developed. After being destroyed by war and typhoon damage, only 42,000 kilowatts remained when our country took over. After one year of efforts in repairs, it has reached more than 180,000 kilowatts, and it will reach 200,000 kilowatts by February next year, 300,000 kilowatts in three years, and 500,000 kilowatts in five years. If we continue with an unremitting spirit, it will not be difficult to complete the development of all 3.2 million kilowatts of hydropower in 20 to 30 years. The remaining power can even be imported into Fujian across the Taiwan Strait to compensate for the province's lack of water resources. Readers will be able to understand everything clearly if they review the attached eight tables.</p>
<h3>A Comparison of Old and New Life in Taiwan: Sun Moon Lake Trends Toward Industrialization, Indigenous People Live a Primitive Life</h3>
<p>— Taiwan Air News, January 5, Tian Bian</p>
<p>Sun Moon Lake in Taiwan is a high-mountain lake, located in the Central Mountain Range. The lake water is the total source of hydroelectric power generation on the island, with beautiful scenery. The hydroelectric power plant there generates 143,000 kilowatts, one of the most modern industrial facilities in the world. What is surprising is that hundreds of indigenous people live on the high mountains beside the lake, still living a primitive life, untouched by the colors of industrialization. (See attached Figures 1 and 2.)</p>
<p>The hospitable indigenous women on the high mountains beside the lake always sing and dance when guests arrive. The illustration shows that the sound of the wood should correspond to the fall of the singing, the speed, and the rhythm, and they should follow each other. Before they sing, they stand in a circle. (See attached Figures 1 and 2.)</p>
<p>All industrial electricity in Taiwan Province is transmitted through the facilities of the Sun Moon Lake Power Plant. The illustration shows the transmission equipment of the power plant. (See attached picture above)</p>

<h3>After Obtaining a Production Loan</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Production loans can be said to be a great help for the general industrial and commercial sectors to solve their current difficulties, because general manufacturers are under the pressure of high-interest loans, and their debt figures are rising day and night, making it truly difficult and impossible to cope with. Although the amount approved by the Production Loan Review Committee may not be the same as the amount originally applied for, it will certainly provide some assistance in solving difficulties.</p>
<p>However, obtaining a production loan can only help with the turnover of funds, which is equivalent to adding a sum of working capital. Everything in the future still depends on one's own efforts. In my opinion, the most important of these so-called own efforts is the issue of organization. The term of a production loan is six months, so in the next six months, unless there is a precise plan, when the deadline expires, it will still be a mess and impossible to solve.</p>
<p>To talk about planning is to talk about organization, which is also a matter of personnel. Manufacturers applying for loans should quickly improve their own organization so that the three departments of production, sales, and economic turnover can be coordinated and carried out under a defined plan. Then, it is not difficult to achieve the goal of prosperity.</p>
<p>Even the smallest things should be rectified and improved. For example, the executives of general manufacturers cannot concentrate on their work, and the working hours are very short, or they concentrate all power in one person, which results in them not being able to cope with ease and, instead, delaying matters. Although this is a small problem, mistakes are often caused by small mistakes, and great difficulties are precisely the accumulation of many small difficulties.</p>
<h3>The Trucking Industry in America</h3>
<p>— Chen Xiang</p>
<p>If the railroad is the spine of American transportation, and the airline is his nerve endings, then what maintains the blood circulation of the American nation is the trucking industry.</p>
<p>Trucks, like Mickey Mouse, occupy an important place in American life. Although the total volume of freight transported by all trucks accounts for only 4.6% of the total transportation volume in the United States, this percentage has its importance. Food that must be quickly transported to the market, products that are delivered directly from the factory to consumers' homes, livestock and fabrics, store deliveries and garbage, oils and mobile libraries—these and thousands of other things are transported by trucks. Two-fifths of American communities are served only by trucks.</p>
<p>The biggest advantages of trucks are, of course, convenience and speed. No modern means of transportation can drive directly into a warehouse like a truck, load goods, and then deliver them to stores in the city. For transporting small quantities of goods, trains are also no match for trucks in terms of time—for example, a truck can travel from New York to Richmond in just two days, but a train requires ten days.</p>
<p>One Car: Can Become a Transportation Unit</p>
<p>In addition, in the past 19 years, the U.S. government has worked hard to pave roads, so trucking has become one of America's major businesses. Twenty years ago, the United States had only 326,000 trucks, but today there are more than 4.5 million. This business can also be said to be personalized because more than half of the trucks belong to people who have only one truck and no more. However, on the other hand, many transportation companies have hundreds of trucks; "American Telephone and Telegraph Company" has as many as 22,000. Although only 15% of these 4 million trucks are leased, the total annual profit of the car owners reaches 2 billion U.S. dollars.</p>
<p>Although the roads in the United States are well-developed, the rules of various states for regulating trucks are different, which causes headaches for drivers and car owners, especially the different weight limits, which have a great impact on the efficiency of trucking.</p>
<p>Load Capacity: One to Twenty-Two Tons</p>
<p>Trucks are mostly sturdy and durable. Half of the trucks currently running on U.S. highways were built before 1937, and some have records of traveling more than one million miles. The styles of cars are truly magnificent; the structure of cars is also becoming more sophisticated, and the most perfect ones are equipped with cold gas, radiators, and air conditioners. The load capacity also varies greatly. In 1924, three-quarters of American trucks were one ton or lighter, but today, due to the different needs, trucking companies can allocate a small car with a load capacity of half a ton to transport packages for you, and can also dispatch a large car with a load capacity of 22.5 tons to work for mines and sawmills. Nineteen car manufacturing companies make a variety of cars for customers to choose from.</p>
<p>As for the drivers of American trucks, they do not view themselves as people who are engaged in hard work. Their job is to transport goods safely and on time, and they faithfully fulfill this responsibility. And they are generally excellent and physically fit drivers. According to recent statistics, there are only 2.4 accident events for every 10,000 miles of all trucks—far lower than the accident record of private cars.</p>
<p>Home is Everywhere: Drivers are Wanderers</p>
<p>The treatment of drivers is not generous. Long-distance drivers are paid two to four U.S. cents per mile; local drivers are paid by the hour or by the day. In New York, the salaries of drivers are generally higher than elsewhere. Working 44 hours a week, the income is only 46 to 64 U.S. dollars. Some lucky drivers can get food and lodging allowances.</p>
<p>Drivers have the same depression as other transportation workers, that is, the more the wheels turn, the farther away from home, and most of them are married. Because of this, their feelings in the industry are particularly close. Experienced drivers know where the best coffee is brewed, which restaurants cook deliciously, and which hotels are hospitable. At the doors of these places, many trucks are often parked non-stop, becoming drivers' meeting places, clubs, and lounges.</p>
<p>Trucking is even more important to the daily life of American cities. 34 of the largest cities use trucks to transport milk. Trucks supply 89% of the poultry to Chicago and 80% of the fruits and vegetables to Los Angeles. Without this regular service, residents of American cities would have to go hungry.</p>
<p>Although the current transportation volume of the American trucking industry is small, the expectations of people in the industry are very high. They hope to take on more business, increase speed, and reduce freight rates. If all these plans are really realized, trucks will become a strong enemy of trains in terms of freight.</p>
<h3>On Improving the Yingkou Port</h3>
<p>— Huang Yihong</p>
<p>Yingkou Port was opened as a commercial port in the eighth year of the Xianfeng Emperor's reign (1858) under the Sino-British Treaty. In the second half of the 19th century, it was the largest commercial port in Northeast China. Subsequently, it gradually declined to become one of the four major commercial ports in Northeast China. The four major commercial ports were Dalian, Binjiang (Harbin), Andong (Dandong), and Yingkou. By the time of the September 18th Incident (1931), it had declined to become one of the seven major commercial ports, which included the aforementioned four ports plus Shenyang, Changchun, and Huludao. At the end of the 19th century, more than 20,000 private ships were berthed in the Liaohe River estuary. In the early years of the Republic of China, there were 3,000 ships. By the time of the September 18th Incident, there were only 1,500 ships. This alone shows a glimpse of its decline.</p>
<p>The reasons for Yingkou's decline can be divided into three points.</p>
<p>First, the Liaohe River estuary has become silted up.</p>
<p>Second, the rise of Dalian.</p>
<p>Third, the completion of the three railway trunk lines: Beining (Beijing-Shenyang), South Manchuria, and Anshan-Shenyang. Although Yingkou Port faces such a major crisis, it still has hopes for revitalization. Here, we hold three hopes:</p>
<p>(1) Open the Songliao Canal. The Liaohe River basin only includes a corner of South Manchuria. If the Songliao Canal is completed, navigation can be extended to the Songhua River basin and deeply into the hinterland of North Manchuria, which can absorb a large amount of materials.</p>
<p>(2) Dredge the Taizi River and Hun River. Both rivers are tributaries of the Liaohe River. The Fushun mining area, which accounts for more than one-third of the total national coal and oil production, is on the bank of the Hun River, and the Anshan Iron Mine and the Miao'angou Gongchangling Mining Area (with Asia's first steel plant) are on the bank of the Taizi River. Coal and iron are heavy, and transportation by shipping is convenient and economical. If these two rivers can be dredged, Yingkou can become the largest coal and iron export port in East Asia.</p>
<p>(3) Improve the river mouth. The waterway should be dredged to a depth of 25 feet so that large coastal vessels can enter and exit without hindrance. Also, because there are too many bends in the lower reaches of the river, silt deposition is easier. Therefore, it is necessary to straighten the bends to permanently maintain the deep-water line.</p>
<p>After the completion of the above plans, Yingkou can surpass Dalian and Andong. Plus,</p>
<p>The health of workers is directly related to production and construction. The US government and industry insiders have keenly understood the benefits of this. Therefore, they advocate research and actively protect the health of workers, sparing no effort. We only need to look at their protection of the eyes of workers to understand this.</p>
<p>The "Department of Social Welfare" of New York State has formulated regulations and specially set up a "Bureau for the Blind." All unfortunate incidents of blindness must be reported to the bureau, including the name, age, address, cause of blindness, and the process. The bureau is responsible for protecting the health of people's eyeballs, preventing blindness, and assisting and supervising the industrial sector to promote eye safety campaigns.</p>
<p>Another social organization, the "National Society for the Prevention of Blindness," has branches in various states, striving to prevent blindness and reduce disability; it regularly assists factories in checking the eyesight of workers; adopting safety goggles (for those engaged in dangerous work); configuring suitable lighting; adjusting the colors painted in factories and on machines; advising on wearing glasses (the association estimates that 40% of workers should wear glasses); and finding ways for people with poor eyesight to engage in less demanding work, so as to avoid excessive damage and blindness. Factories are also generally happy to improve and accept the association's advice. (Translated from Industrial Medicine June, 1946)</p>

<h3>Introduction to Business Administration</h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>Implementation of Personnel Management</p>
<p>Two, Selection</p>
<p>In the selection process, there are several steps, which can be divided into: A. Filling out forms: Recording the details of each item to be filled out. B. Testing. C. Interviewing. D. Physical examination. Now, let's describe them separately.</p>
<p>A. Filling out forms: Regarding this type of form, it becomes simple or complex according to the needs of each enterprise organization. Now, we can record the items included in the employee application form of the American Edison Company.</p>
<p>1. Name, 2. Signature style, 3. Permanent address, 4. Can you live near the company? 5. How to relocate? 6. Mailing address, 7. Telegraph, 8. Own or rent a house? 9. Live independently or have meals provided by the landlord? 10. Information on cohabitants, 11. Place of birth, 12. Native place, 13. Native place of parents, 14. Father's address, 15. Father's occupation, 16. Married or not? 17. Number of children, 18. Who bears the family expenses? 19. Height, 20. Weight, 21. Health status, 22. Any physical defects? 23. Have you ever committed a crime? Time, place, reason, 24. Financial situation, 25. Have you ever taken out life insurance? 26. Religion, 27. Social groups you have joined, 28. How many foreign languages ​​do you know besides English? 29. What languages ​​can you write? 30. What newspapers do you usually read? 31. What magazines do you usually read? 32. What work are you doing in terms of self-cultivation? 33. Have you ever handled money matters before? 34. If you are hired, are you planning to work part-time again? 35. Have you ever had a relationship with this company before? Time and situation, 36. If you have relatives and friends working in this company, please describe in detail, name, position, address, 37. List seven relatives and friends who can be asked about everything about you by this company at any time, 38. When can you start working if hired by this company? 39. What kind of work do you like to do? 40. What kind of reward do you hope to get?</p>
<p>In addition to the above 40 points, there are also investigations on education and experience. Regarding education, it includes year, school, grade, major. Regarding experience, it includes year, company name, business nature, position, reason for leaving.</p>
<p>Because of this kind of investigation form, you can first conduct an investigation when hiring. If you think it is unsatisfactory, then you can refuse to meet them, select those who are more satisfactory, and then proceed with other matters. Sometimes, a photo of the person is required for verification.</p>
<p>This kind of form can be attached with an employment record at the bottom, such as: 1. Date of employment, 2. Working department, 3. Guarantor, 4. Salary. Then, after the employee is hired, the investigation form can be stored.</p>
<p>If you avoid posting newspaper advertisements, you can wait for the application letters to arrive and then do the first step of selection, select a considerable number of applicants, send them the above investigation form to fill out and send it out, and then set a date for testing, or notify the date in advance and bring the filled-out investigation form to the testing place on the day.</p>
<p>B. Testing: Regarding the conduct of the test, you can refer to the various tests mentioned in the employee psychology section, list the questions to be tested together, and then ask the applicants to answer each item one by one.</p>
<p>C. Interview: During the interview, you can ask various questions to supplement the deficiencies of the test. The points mentioned in the employee's heart, regarding (1) honesty, (2) loyalty, (3) cooperation with colleagues, are questions that can be asked during the meeting, and the remaining types can be tested.</p>
<p>The interview place must be spacious, with a spacious waiting area outside. Because even if that group of people is here to apply, they must be made absolutely comfortable in spirit. However, the person in charge of the interview must also speak kindly, and not put on a dignified face, which will cause people to feel fear and affect the answer.</p>
<p>Production Tidbits</p>
<h3>Nylon Manufacturing Method</h3>
<p>— Shiqi</p>
<p>During the war, nylon was exclusively used by the military for the manufacture of parachutes. Therefore, ever since the first pair of nylon stockings appeared on the market in 1940, demand has always exceeded supply. Today, 90 percent of nylon is used to make women's stockings. DuPont plans to produce 23,000,000 pounds of nylon yarn annually, or 450,000,000 pairs of stockings.</p>
<p>This shiny synthetic fiber is spun from coal, air, and water. The process of making nylon is briefly introduced below:</p>
<p>The raw materials for nylon are coal, water, and air. Carbon is extracted from coal, hydrogen from water, and oxygen from air. These four elements form the crude nylon, called nylon salt.</p>
<p>The nylon salt solution is evaporated in a large vessel to completely evaporate the water. Then, the nylon enters another bucket, where the small molecules of nylon are polymerized at high temperature to form chain-shaped long molecules.</p>
<p>The thing obtained by this polymerization flows out of the flat hole in a molten state, like toothpaste, called Polymer ribbon. On the drum, one side of the drum is immersed in cold water. As the drum rotates, the nylon cools and hardens, and goes to the cutting table to be cut into thin slices. The resulting flakes must be put into a mixer and a warm roller to mix, so as to make the quality uniform.</p>
<p>After mixing, it is heated again to melt it, and the melt is extruded through small holes in a metal plate to make nylon fibers. These fibers solidify quickly in cold air, and then are spun into nylon yarn on a spinning machine.</p>
<p>Take a sample of nylon yarn from the yarn bobbin of the spinning machine, take a certain length of it, and put it on the balance to weigh and distinguish the thickness of the nylon yarn. Distinguish its thickness on the yarn bobbin. Put the yarn bobbin into the box and dry it in the nylon yarn twist finishing furnace. Then wind it on the spool again.</p>
<p>The nylon yarn is spun from one spool to another, passing through a machine, with a layer of glue on the surface of the yarn, so as to protect it when weaving silk or other fabrics. The nylon yarn of each yarn bobbin or spool is still carefully inspected to ensure that it is complete and flawless, and then it must be packed and transported to the knitting factory.</p>

<h3>Learn While You're Old, Do While You're Old, Youth Never Fades</h3>
<p>— Translated by Chun from this month's Reader's Digest</p>
<p>Almost in any year of your life, the fear of "old age" can strike you at any time. As a psychologist specializing in the various problems of the elderly, I have found that a larger percentage of my patients are young adults in their thirties -- those young men and women who are already worried about the increase in age and are trying to learn how to deal with those increased years. I am about to say seven things that will be beneficial for anyone from the age of ten to seventy, if he is interested in maintaining his youth.</p>
<p>But before I tell you my prescription, I think it's best to explain the ages of life again. Age should not be calculated based on the number of your birthdays. First, physiological time is completely different from clock time. As age increases, physiological time slows down; the older you get, the slower your age increases. Physiologically speaking, the change between the ages of thirty and forty will not be more than the change between the ages of twenty-five and thirty; the change from fifty-five to seventy-five will not be more than the change from forty to fifty-five.</p>
<p>Another reason why it is wrong to calculate age with a calendar is that different parts of your body age at different rates. Your eyes start at the age of ten; your hearing starts at the age of nearly twenty. By the age of thirty, the strength of your muscles, the function of your reactions, and the energy of reproduction have all just passed their peak. The brain ages the slowest. On the other hand, your brain is still young, and is still growing at the age of fifty; your brain reaches its peak ten years after this age. From the age of sixty, mental abilities age very slowly, until the age of eighty.</p>
<p>At the age of eighty, you can maintain the same strength mentally as you did at the age of thirty -- and you should know more than you did at the age of thirty. Old people often feel pain because of the loss of their memory, but creative imagination exists forever without age. What else? Age makes our self-reflection and observation more developed. Our judgment and understanding are also improving because of this; therefore, thanks to the rich experience, we have wonderful ideas to solve all the difficulties in life. In short, the increase in age makes us gain wisdom. This is why old doctors, experienced lawyers, and experienced technicians can still often compete with those younger and stronger opponents.</p>
<p>Learn one thing every day</p>
<p>My prescription for staying young is very simple: focus all your attention on the part that is still young and still growing -- your brain. Keep your mind forever awake, and then you will live completely in youth. The present is an exciting and stimulating era. You should be interested in the world around you and learn at least one new thing every day. (Translator's note: The so-called "renew yourself daily, renew yourself every day" is also.)</p>
<p>The most important thing is never to "sit down and enjoy happiness." Psychologists are accustomed to seeing that at the age of thirty, people have two opposite personalities. Some men and women, while doing their jobs and taking care of their families, are still constantly developing other new interests. They study newspapers and magazines. They do creative hobbies and like to use their hands and brains.</p>
<p>No matter how old you are now, it is still not too late to make your life more interesting. I know a housewife who, at the age of fifty, had no experience at all, and began to turn herself into a super industrial pattern designer. I know a retired electrical engineer who has become a highly paid porcelain painter. One of my patients -- a seventy-year-old woman, whose children and grandchildren thought she was too old and incompetent to retire -- founded a cooking school specializing in teaching brides, and it was very successful.</p>
<p>Learn when you're old</p>
<p>Don't think that you are too old to go to school again. Get rid of this idea completely! I know a man who went to medical school at the age of seventy. He earned titles and honors and became a famous doctor. Another person went to law school at the age of seventy-one and is now a prominent lawyer. American history currently holds a record that has not yet been broken, that is, a ninety-one-year-old woman from California went to college to study as a freshman. I know a woman who went to learn painting at the age of seventy-seven, opened a solo exhibition at the age of eighty, and is still working hard today at the age of eighty-six.</p>
<p>No matter how old you are, if you want to stay young, it is very easy for people with unlimited potential. If you are happy to try, you will definitely be able to do it. Keep your mind forever awake and forever active; this is the insurance and effective elixir of life.</p>

<p>The State of the World, the Taste of Humanity</p>
<p>Someone asked a profound writer, "What is the definition of a bank?" The famous writer replied: "He lends you an umbrella on a sunny day, and when it rains, he takes the umbrella back."</p>
<p>Adding flowers to the brocade is the duty of a banker, and adding frost to the snow is the banker's unique skill.</p>
<p>A young man entered a money shop to learn the trade. The shopkeeper gave him a lecture: "If you want to do money business, the first secret is to cut off six relatives. No matter who your relatives and friends are, you must lend money according to the rules. Even your father is no exception." He taught him to kowtow to the rich and roll his eyes at the poor.</p>
<p>If you want to find the state of the world and the taste of humanity, it is best to go to the bank for a walk. They have armed guards with live ammunition, tall iron counters, and a cold air emanating from the eyes of the bank tellers in the window holes. He thinks that the person who comes to the door is not a good person. You take a belly full of enthusiasm to exchange for his group of gloom.</p>
<p>Collateral, collateral, collateral!</p>
<p>Many people hope that bankers will be philanthropists, but this idea is completely wrong. You think their conditions are so fierce: "Collateral", "Collateral", "Collateral", their dictionary has no "goodwill". The first word is reliable and unchanging collateral, the second word is collateral that can be sold at any time, and the third word is collateral that will never cause disputes. He wants to hold the debtor in his palm, so that you can't escape, can't deny it, and finally can't lose. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce wants to ask bankers to relax the standards, simplify procedures, and change collateral, but they did not expect to have done so many years of business experience that they do not even know the banker's tastes, no wonder they are hitting rubber nails. It must be known that their minds are taught by the former teachers, and even their fathers have no status, and they still care about what kind of guild you are doing.</p>
<p>There was an ambitious person who had not been taught by the teacher and妄想to be a banker. One day, the position was not balanced. He called a bank and asked to postpone the yesterday's拆放款项for one day. He also didn't understand the banker's tastes. According to the usual practice, he should say that it was sunny, but he said that it rained yesterday. He didn't say: "My position is very loose, it doesn't matter whether the extension is extended or not. If your position is large, I can share a little, and there is also collateral, please tell me." Instead, he said: "I can't do it, I can't balance it, and it's no good for you if I fall." This is the sound of calling for help, and it is also telling him that if you are not careful, you will also fall into the water, which scares people so much that they have to take back the money from yesterday; because they know that it will rain, which is incomparable to a sunny day, and the umbrella should be taken back as usual. The ambitious person who had his umbrella taken back finally got rained on and fell down.</p>
<p>There is another bank where the business personnel are too sentimental. The original collateral was cheated away by the customer, and the loan could not be recovered. This is the loss of not cutting off six new ones, and it is considered that they are not experienced enough and need to be trained.</p>
<h3>Do You Want to Borrow an Umbrella?</h3>
<p>The story of求魚on a tree is probably written for the current bankers. People say that Mr. So-and-so's abacus is very shrewd, and Mr. So-and-so's methods are very煞辣. Don't blame them, they are all bankers. If you have an umbrella, he still wants to lend it to you even when it rains. If you have neither a raincoat nor an umbrella, he will see if the sun comes out, otherwise you can't borrow an umbrella. There are many stupid people in the world, but there is no one more stupid than the stupid person who goes to ask a banker for an umbrella on a rainy day.</p>
<p>In order to remind smart people to be smarter, and not to become smart stupid people, the tastes of bankers are written for readers to taste.</p>
<h3>The "Curie Couple" in the Movie</h3>
<h3>This is King George VI's family, taken in the Windsor Garden. The one squatting is the eldest daughter of the King, who is currently suffering from marriage problems. Is it really unfortunate to be born in the royal family? (Note that the marriage problem between the eldest daughter of the King, Elizabeth, and Prince Philip of Greece, is still under consideration by the British Cabinet.)</h3>
<h3>Stamps</h3>
<p>— Shixiong</p>
<p>American calligrapher John Billing taught his son: "My son, look at the stamps. The good thing about stamps is that they stick to everything and don't let go until they reach their destination."</p>
<h3>A Mistake of One Sound</h3>
<p>— Wan Shiwan</p>
<p>"Sui" - Wan "Shui" (year - ten thousand taxes), Tai "Ping" - Tai "Pin" (peace - too poor), Jiu "Ji" - Jiu "Ji" (relief - save oneself), "Jie" Shou - "Jie" Shou (receive - rob), "Ji" Pu Che - "Ji" Pu Che (Jeep - strike Jeep), Gong er "Wu" Si - Gong er "Wu" Si (public and selfless - public and dance private).</p>
<h3>An Outdated Allegory; Churchill and the Carp</h3>
<p>— Zong Liang</p>
<p>After the fall of France, in that area ruled by the enemy, people were whispering a very famous allegory:</p>
<p>The story is about July 1940, when Britain was fighting the enemy alone, Hitler invited Churchill to Paris for a secret meeting. When Churchill arrived by plane, he was greeted at the Villa de Fontenbleau, where Hitler and Mussolini were waiting at a tea table by the famous carp pond.</p>
<p>The German leader was not willing to waste time: "Churchill, this is what I want to say to you, Britain is finished. Sign this document, admit that Britain has been defeated, and then all of Europe will have peace tomorrow!"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry I can't sign," Churchill replied calmly: "I don't admit that we have been defeated."</p>
<p>"Absurd!" Hitler slammed the table and said loudly: "The facts prove it!"</p>
<p>Churchill drank a cup of tea, "In England," he said, "we often use gambling to solve differences of opinion. Are you willing to gamble with me? The loser should admit that he is the loser in the war."</p>
<p>"How to gamble?" the German leader asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>"Do you see those big carp in the pond? Well, let's bet that without any ordinary fishing equipment, whoever catches a carp first will be the winner of the war."</p>
<p>"Let's bet!" Hitler roared. He pulled out a pistol and fired wildly at the carp near him. However, the pond water deflected the bullets, and the carp continued to swim unharmed.</p>
<p>"You come, Musso!" Hitler roared. "People tell me you are a swimming expert -- jump in!"</p>
<p>The Italian president took off his clothes and jumped into the pond, but although he tried hard, the carp always slipped out of his grasp. Finally, he was exhausted and climbed ashore empty-handed.</p>
<p>"Churchill, it's your turn." Hitler said nervously: "Let's see what you can do!"</p>
<p>Churchill calmly dipped his teaspoon in the water, lifted a spoonful of water, and threw it over his shoulder. He kept taking water out of the pond like this. Hitler opened his mouth in surprise and watched and said: "What are you doing here?" He asked impatiently.</p>
<p>"Although it will take a long time, the pond water will eventually dry up." Churchill replied while continuing to take water out, "Victory will belong to me!" Size matters. Big and small matters in the world are excerpted here.</p>
<h3>Garbage and Vegetables</h3>
<p>— Fang Wen</p>
<p>Because garbage trucks transported vegetables and yellow croakers, it caused a wave of criticism from the Municipal Council, causing a city-wide uproar. Calmly speaking, in this difficult life, it is inevitable to be selfish. Using garbage trucks to do some side businesses to subsidize the livelihood of the drivers cannot be equated with the general officialdom, colluding up and down, and engaging in corruption, and it is better than using public cars to send wives to mahjong games and send sons and daughters to dance halls and cinemas; however, because of focusing on making money, the garbage in the city is piled up like a mountain, and it seems that he cannot shirk his responsibility for neglecting public duties for personal gain. Moreover, the Municipal Health Bureau is in charge of the city's health, and it seems a bit "that" to use garbage trucks to transport vegetables and yellow croakers!</p>
<h3>Gold, Dirt, Fabrication.</h3>
<p>— Fang</p>
<p>The Rebirth Island Treasure Case has been transformed from gold bars into dirt, and from dirt into fabrication. It is confusing and fascinating. Fortunately, the prosecutor went to Jiangnan three times and got clues. The truth of the case will soon be revealed, and the protagonist in the case will soon lose his qualification as a mysterious figure.</p>
<h3>"Waves in a Teacup"</h3>
<p>— Fang</p>
<p>The Hong Kong policeman who kicked the hawker Wang Yongxiang to death was previously declared innocent by the High Court. The Hong Kong government agreed to give the family a pension of HK$10,000, which at least established a legal price for Chinese lives on Hong Kong Island. However, disputes arose over the procedures for receiving the money, and the Hong Kong government is "dragging its feet" and reconsidering, unable to pay the money to the deceased's family quickly. From "their" perspective, of course, this is just "waves in a teacup!"</p>
<p>(Note: A certain Englishman previously described the Hong Kong issue as "waves in a teacup.")</p>
<h3>Truman's Difficulties</h3>
<p>— Jiayuan</p>
<p>The new U.S. Congress has officially been established. Since the new year, Truman has delivered two State of the Union addresses to the new Congress, presenting his economic report and new budget. Due to the Republican victory in the 1946 congressional elections, the U.S. Congress's Senate and House of Representatives are effectively under Republican control, while the President is a Democrat. Although the policies of the Democratic and Republican parties in the United States have recently converged, there are still many differences, especially in domestic affairs. The U.S. Congress is like the head of the household, and the President is like the general manager of the family. The opinions between the head of the household and the general manager often diverge, making things difficult. Wilson and Hoover encountered similar difficulties in the past. Truman will also face the same challenges.</p>
<h3>Disputes in the Security Council</h3>
<p>— Nan</p>
<p>The Security Council has recently been in fierce dispute over the issues of atomic control and general disarmament, with representatives from the United States and the Soviet Union engaging in heated verbal battles at the meeting. The United States insists on prioritizing discussions on atomic control, demanding that the recommendations it has put forward be followed, that the veto power not apply in this area, and that a supervisory agency be established to effectively control the handling of atomic energy materials in all countries. Otherwise, it is unwilling to participate in disarmament discussions. The Soviet Union is using the shield of general disarmament to block it. But in fact, if Washington and Moscow are determined to solve this problem, then the responsible personnel of the two countries should grasp the crux of the problem and talk it through clearly. Otherwise, why bother going through the motions?</p>
<h3>Montgomery's Visit to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>— Nan</p>
<p>British Chief of Staff Marshal Montgomery's visit to the Soviet Union was also a major piece of news. It is remembered that when the Marshal visited the United States to discuss the standardization of British and American armaments and visited Canada to discuss defense work in the Arctic region, the Soviet Union felt greatly uneasy, believing that these measures were aimed at the Soviet Union. This time, Marshal Montgomery's visit to the Soviet Union was quite unexpected, and the Soviet side was also somewhat surprised when they first heard the news. In fact, the standardization of British and American armaments, the defense of the Arctic, and so on, may simply be based on wartime lessons to prevent unforeseen circumstances. Just as the Soviet Union has established a defensive ring around its periphery, there is no need for so much suspicion. Now, Marshal Montgomery is going to the Soviet Union to explain the details clearly, which can dispel some of the clouds of suspicion shrouding the world.</p>
<h3>Colonies</h3>
<p>— Wang</p>
<p>The colonial issue is becoming increasingly intense. Indonesia, Vietnam, India... everywhere is in chaos, and no appropriate solution can be found. According to the ruling countries such as Britain, France, and the Netherlands, they seem to have no intention of oppressing the colonies, but the people of the colonies have their due freedom and rights and will never be willing to continue in this way.</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Chunmei</h3>
<p>— Qinlu</p>
<p>"Blame it all you want, but I don't have a pretty daughter-in-law to give to the bailiff. At my age, I still have to go to the county to pay taxes myself. Last time, when I walked to Songgang, I was so out of breath that I couldn't catch it. Luckily, Cao San's eldest son was kind enough to carry me over the hill. It was hard enough to find the place to pay taxes, but those people pulled long faces, as if I owed them Chen Damai, picking sand and complaining about weeds, almost making me angry to death. If I had a pretty daughter-in-law, my taxes would be waived, and who would dare to fart no?" Granny Zhao Wu, holding a bowl of sweet potato porridge, babbled on and on to Xiao Chong, a farmhand from the Cao Da's family next door. She saw Chunmei hanging clothes on the threshing floor, and she deliberately raised her voice and said:</p>
<p>"Her man is nowhere to be found, and she's still so interested in dressing in bright red and green. I guess she still has her eye on that old fellow."</p>
<p>Xiao Chong, afraid of getting into trouble, slipped away. Only then did Granny Zhao Wu stop talking, holding the porridge, and drinking it with slurping sounds.</p>
<p>Chunmei pretended not to hear, and hung the clothes with her head down.</p>
<p>"Time to eat!" her mother-in-law called. She didn't answer, picked up the wooden bucket, and walked towards the house. Granny Zhao Wu made a face at her from behind.</p>
<p>"I've seen all kinds of daughters-in-law in the world, but I've never seen anything like you, with that mournful face all day long. That Wang the Blind Man's fortune-telling was really accurate, saying you were born with a jinx, not wrong at all. Since Fa'gen left a few years ago, not a single word from him. Who would believe he's still alive? Look at those cheekbones like two mountains, your unlucky horoscope has harmed our Zhang family," Zhang Da said fiercely.</p>
<p>Chunmei silently picked up the corn porridge on the table. Suddenly, she felt nauseous, and she quickly held it back and ran into the room. Granny Zhang walked to the door to greet Bailiff Ding, who was walking along the roadside.</p>
<p>Bailiff Ding came in and sat down, sizing her up. Granny Zhang saw this clearly from the side and quickly smiled and said:</p>
<p>"Chunmei is getting prettier and prettier. She doesn't like corn porridge and is hiding in the room getting angry!"</p>
<p>Bailiff Ding immediately frowned and said:</p>
<p>"Did you use up all the money I gave you last time?" He took out a wad of banknotes and put them on the table. "Don't eat corn porridge anymore. Buy her what she likes to eat. If you run out of money, ask me again!"</p>
<p>Bailiff Ding slowly strolled into Chunmei's room. After a while, he came out with joy all over his face and said softly to Granny Zhang:</p>
<p>"You have to take good care of her and not let her do any work. You know that old freak in my family has given birth to a pile of money-losing goods. Up until now, I don't even have a son."</p>
<p>Granny Zhang watched Bailiff Ding walk away and then went back to her own room to get a few pairs of torn socks to give to Chunmei. "I want to wear these today. Hurry up and mend them for me," she said, and then went next door to chat.</p>
<p>Chunmei cleared the table, cleaned the kitchen and the hall, and then sat down to mend the socks.</p>
<p>She had married into the Zhang family at the age of seventeen. From the first day she was a new bride, she had never had a peaceful day. She and her husband had a good relationship, but because of this, she didn't know how much grief she had suffered from her mother-in-law. Whenever Granny Zhang started scolding, Zhang Fa'gen would find an excuse to leave, and Chunmei would hide in the room, afraid to come out. If her mother-in-law saw her with red and swollen eyes, she would say that she was used to being coquettish in front of men and instigating him to be unfilial to his old mother. Whenever she was extremely sad, Chunmei couldn't help but think of her mother. When she was very young, her mother often secretly held her hand and shed tears, complaining that God was blind and had made her meet such a mother-in-law.</p>
<p>In recent years, Chunmei had cautiously observed "female virtues." She endured her mother-in-law's endless insults. Since her husband went off to war, her mother-in-law's temper had grown even worse, but she still endured it, believing that serving her mother-in-law was a way of being worthy of her husband.</p>
<p>More than a year ago, the bailiff had asked someone to tell Granny Zhang that he wanted to marry Chunmei as his second wife. Because of this, Chunmei had cried her heart out. Her family had taken her back to live with them for a while, but she was still worried about her mother-in-law being unattended, so she insisted on returning. Finally, Chunmei was tricked by Bailiff Ding and Granny Zhang. She thought that this was fate, and except for thinking of Fa'gen and often crying, she rarely thought of anything else. She did feel a bit uneasy about Granny Zhao Wu's gossip this morning, but when she thought about being pregnant, she felt a few unnamed surprises.</p>
<p>"Is Chunmei home?" someone asked softly.</p>
<p>Chunmei looked up and suddenly blushed, running into the room. It turned out to be the bailiff's wife, known for her shrewishness. She saw Chunmei hide in the room, so she followed her in and closed the door. After a while, she came out and left. Immediately, Chunmei let out a burst of crying and moaning in the room...</p>
<p>"You can't find a lazy thing like this in the world. At this time, she still hasn't started a fire to cook. Does she intend to starve her old mother to death?" Granny Zhang cursed as she came in.</p>
<p>"I think you've put on enough of an act. Giving birth to a child is nothing strange. Do you need to make such a fuss!" She pushed open Chunmei's door and cried out in surprise, bursting into tears, ignoring Chunmei, who was unconscious, and went to Bailiff Ding's house.</p>
<p>Bailiff Ding came with people. They first untied Chunmei from the beam and placed her on the bed. Several people were so busy in the small room that they couldn't move.</p>
<p>"It's too late..." Granny Zhang thought of how good Chunmei had been to her on weekdays, and her conscience was awakened, unable to hold back her sobs.</p>
<p>The bailiff's wife rushed over in a few steps, threw herself on Chunmei's body, and burst into tears.</p>
<p>"Chunmei! I was counting on you to continue the line for our Ding family..."</p>
<p>Granny Zhang listlessly let go of Chunmei's cold hand, covered her face, and walked out...</p>
<h3>Night Reading Notes</h3>
<p>— Li Wenxun</p>
<p>Reading Peng Weier's "On Poetry," he argues that writing poetry should be like doing fractions in mathematics, as clean and polished as possible. His meaning is nothing more than saying that poetry should be simple and beautiful. His tone is concise and lovely, and passionate. His poems do not emphasize antithesis, value the freedom of sentiment, and especially cherish the beauty of nature. Therefore, as soon as you open his poems, you can smell the fragrance of lilies and roses. In the quiet of the night, music floats down from the heavens. No wonder Moore says he is a singer rather than a poet...</p>
<p>Shelley's death often makes me close the book and sigh, lamenting why the world's geniuses are all short-lived. Although not every line of his poems is a masterpiece, phrases such as, "I never was attached to that great sect. Whose doctrine is, that each one should select, From all that he might read in their own books, Just as much faith as suited his own looks", and "music to hear, why be behest, than music Sadlyi sweets witheets uan not joy dilights.in joy."</p>
<p>I feel that every word is just right, and you can't add or delete a single one. If it were a Chinese poet, he would definitely talk about "wind-born phoenixes," "great shonas," and all sorts of joyous and sweet theories, tearing the beautiful artistic conception into small pieces. The reason why Moore loved Shelley so deeply was also because of his gentle, far-reaching, and metaphysical atmosphere.</p>
<h3>Scenery of Barbizon</h3>
<p>— Corot</p>
<p>Corot (Jean Baptiste Camille Corot 1796-1875) was a pure Parisian. His early works were classical. After becoming tired of Paris, his style changed when he arrived in Barbizon, faithfully adhering to nature and creating a unique style. His later works were mostly landscapes, with elegant colors, light brushstrokes, and particularly clever composition. The entire painting reveals a quiet and elegant poetic atmosphere. He produced a wealth of work throughout his life, with over three thousand pieces existing in the United States alone. This painting is an oil painting, currently housed in the Louvre Museum in Paris, France. (Lion)</p>
<h3>Poems from Outside the Dream Pavilion</h3>
<p>— Xu Chengyu</p>
<p>Sitting with Feibai at Baijiang Tower at Night, Immediately Presented</p>
<p>The traces of hegemonic strategies and royal plans have become history, and today there is no one to match your talent. Stop saying that you understand the profound principles of Samadhi, and instead seek refuge from the Ten Qin among the clouds. Bellflowers and chickens all have imperial qualities, and those wearing lotus leaves and fragrant belts are also human. Sitting in the river tower, facing the West Mountain moon, this is the eternal body of the Divine Land.</p>
<p>Inscribed on the Poetry Scroll of Yu Laoqi</p>
<p>In the Southern Kingdom, there is a poet named Yu, whose verses cherish the fragrant smoke of rivers and mountains. He carries the moon from the plum ridge and the sky, writing it into the clouds on the paper of the Songhua River. The final draft is worthy of being passed down on jade tablets, but the remaining atmosphere of the Divine Land has not yet been calmed. Do not add more sorrow and resentment to your poetic feelings, lest the remaining people cannot bear to hear it.</p>
<p>A hundred battles, the autumn branches have not withered, sitting in the empty hall, listening to the rain like a tide. Settling the mind and returning to peace, allowing the rivers and mountains to be lonely before the eyes. The water rises, the ducklings are delicious, and the lonely wild geese soar in the sky. Human affairs depend on the flow, only standing in front of the door are ten-foot banana trees.</p>
<p>An old friend's family lives in Nanchong City, where smoke and flowers cover the spring clouds above the city. The old friend's hermitage is on the west side of the city, where lectures are lively and full of wonderful things. Not only does his calligraphy and ink enter the subtle and faint, but he also directly pursues the rustic customs of Qiyuan and the Lake Li villages. He invites me to travel all over West Mountain, and I no longer see the White Deer Academy in my eyes. He still intends to cast Yao and Shun in his remaining affairs, and it is not difficult to change the customs and transform them into elegant ones. The personalities of a hundred years are not ordinary, and I am ashamed of my weak strength in the face of molding them. Next year's spring light will float on the Han River, and turning my head in the clouds, I will see West Mountain.</p>
<p>About to Leave West Mountain, First Have This Work</p>
<p>In the third month, the Jiālíng River is about to end in spring, and the one who is leaving is glorious again. Facing the window, accumulated green clouds are stacked in thousands. Behind the mountain ridge, the empty water sways in one direction. The stone steps are sparse with flowers, leaving behind the dream rain, and the old egrets on the paulownia branches send off the remaining afterglow. Next year, at this time, we will still remember each other, and the fragrant grass and clear river will resemble Hanyang.</p>
<p>An impromptu verse at Qingju Mountain Pass</p>
<p>Steep cliffs embrace the high platform halfway up the sky, the old fortress is empty and the setting sun shines brightly. How many generations have become pillars in the middle of the stream, the green mountains are safe and sound, and I have come again.</p>
<p>Bell argues in his "Theory of Art" that literary groups and cliques are entirely organzations to promote their ideas, that geniuses are initially attacked, and if they cannot be defeated, they are scolded for being backward and decadent, and the frame is placed on their heads. Thus, the genius painters of Barbizon had no choice but to escape Paris to the green countryside, and even the best geniuses, such as Van Gogh, could only sit in cafes, engage in idle talk, and eventually go crazy and commit suicide in the sunlight they loved. Valery's fate was not much different. There are still very few poets in the world who, like Schiller, are not afraid of soft or hard tactics. If I had Byron's talent, I would definitely challenge the "Edinburgh" gentlemen to a mortal duel, but unfortunately, I lack his talent, so I'm talking a bit presumptuously.</p>
<p>Gide's two turns have been noticed by the world, but few people are willing to focus on his love. Gide is a poet who, apart from life and truth, would not utter any flattery or falsehood. His philosophical distress and various worldly contradictions may not have been seen by the world. Reading his "Travels in the Congo" and "Letters from Italy," the flower-scented cities and sunny countries, and the sights and paces of Florence, are so full of charming thoughts and scenery that they seem to drip with water. How passionate Gide's hope for the future of life is! The apples are ripe, letting everyone's mouth get close to them, and everyone is invited to the feast of heaven. Gide is truly a lovable poet who is willing to use his energy to talk about life. His love and maturity deeply move people.</p>
<p>Reading the French poet Vigny's tragedy "Chatterton," the coldness of the world and the fickleness of human relationships are chilling. This is a real person, Thomas Chatterton, a young English poet of the nineteenth century. At the age of twenty-three, he took all his poems to the human gathering place of London, wanting to display his beautiful poems to people like a child, but he received ridicule and mockery. No one paid any attention to him. He lived alone in a rented shack, without a friend or relative, shivering in the cold winter night, hungry and cold, unable to imagine that a woman would sympathize with him, loving his youth and talent, secretly squeezing out coins and bread. This woman was his landlady, young and beautiful, and mature, with a good heart. But this kindness and beauty was obviously unable to heal the poet's severely wounded heart. One snowy night, he swallowed a large amount of arsenic and quietly escaped this vile world. This ending was tragic enough, but unexpectedly, after his death, those "most holy teachers"-like "literary mentors" greatly appreciated him, held memorial services, and published a special collection of his works... This situation is even more tragic.</p>
<p>American anarchist scholar Hodder wrote "Dialogue in Heaven." Although heaven is lonely, it is full of human affection, and although the human world is lively, it is full of absurdities, it is truly an indescribable sigh. After reading it, sorrow surges. However, as Tolstoy said, "The Kingdom of God" is originally in the hearts of human beings. The ebb and flow of the heart is a state of mind, just like walking around a corner, there are dung pits and gardens, it just depends on how you walk.</p>
<p>The meaning of life, although it is a topic of endless dispute, but looking at Nietzsche's and Tolstoy's views, it is nothing more than seeking the sublimation of life, but the paths are different, and there is only one direction. Humans are born unwilling to settle down, and life is truly like a foolish farce, perhaps without any joys, sorrows, loves, or hates. Tolstoy said that all learning is meaningless if reasoning does not match the purpose. His theoretical basis lies in a group and its interests—morality. Nietzsche's so-called "Created for me, given without pity," is outside the group. If the center of the world is still in humanity, then Tolstoy's view is naturally correct, but if we focus on the completeness of heavenly principles, then the truth seems to belong to Nietzsche. Both started from the "heart," but the results unexpectedly ran in opposite directions, and in the end, they could not avoid returning to the same destination through different paths. Tolstoy's painstaking efforts are moving, and Nietzsche's hard work is admirable, but after rereading "弗浴伊特叙傳", his heart for learning and winning is even better than Nietzsche's. Not only are thinkers like this, but so are good poets. Gide, in "New Nourishment," discusses that the highest goal of life should be to value desire, value the present, value the future, value liberation, and value creation. His unrestrained passion is truly like Nietzsche... From this perspective, we must be enriched, we must do things, we must suffer, we must strengthen ourselves to fight, and our articles must be solid.</p>
<p>Reading Pater's "Marius the Epicurean," I gained many insights about the true meaning and price of thought. Marius began as an apostle of Epicurus and ended as a Christian martyr. Everywhere are traces of the heart, traces of blood. The chapter "The Golden Book" elaborates on Apuleius's myth of Cupid and Psyche, with human feelings and beauty. The chapter "The Dialogue" is full of wisdom about the debate between philosophy and truth, and the thoughts are so fragrant that they are intoxicating, more than being drunk on wine. From this, I deeply feel that the bookworms in the world are really much happier than kings and nobles.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of Blood 146</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>In ancient Chinese weapons, the sword is a sacred object that ordinary martial arts practitioners cannot afford. But clearly it is a parade saber, why do the Japanese insist that it is a sword? What is the reason? The "judo" they call large is merely a remnant of Chinese martial arts. But the blind people of the world all say that this is Eastern boxing, encompassing everything, and they also praise the Japanese martial arts as being powerful. This small matter of nomenclature is enough to make people angry.</p>
<p>Martial arts, or boxing, is not easy to talk about. The so-called Japanese boxing is merely a kind of Chinese grappling, or wrestling, which, although it is a kind of boxing, cannot be used to encompass all martial arts. Furthermore, looking at the current "swordplay" of the Japanese, the first thing, "grabbing with both hands," is at least one hundred and eight thousand miles away from swordplay. Those four techniques of chopping, splitting, cutting, and slashing are clearly the preliminary methods that parade saber users, and everyone must know how to use them, as the "lifesaving moves" for lower-ranking soldiers to fight in close combat. To insist that this little bit of thing is kendo is enough to make insiders laugh their jaws off. The advanced parade saber has 108 steps and 36 techniques; the steps are divided into virtual and real, the hands have yin and yang, and the steps and hands correspond everywhere, which is the format of the parade saber. These four lifesaving moves currently practiced in Japan are not even up to the level of superior parade saber techniques, so how can they be worthy of being called kendo?</p>
<p>However, the Japanese "kendo" also has a history of several hundred thousand years. Is it possible that there is not a single shred of "reason" in the way they practice it? That's not entirely true either. As the saying goes, "If you put in enough effort, an iron pestle can be ground into a needle." The only thing to fear in any skill is not being willing to put in the effort. If you are willing to put in the effort, even if you don't have a legitimate master, you can still grind out some principles over time.</p>
<p>Therefore, since Japanese kendo has been divided into six levels and nine paths, it is said that no one has ever reached the sixth level or the ninth path. The saying of six levels stopped circulating before the Meiji Restoration, and only nine paths remained. Only a very few of their ancient and modern kendo masters have practiced to the eighth path; the so-called eighth path is actually the end of the seventh path. The Japanese are naturally prone to exaggeration. Once they reach the end of the seventh path, since no one dares to compete with them, and there is no proof after death, they can only be allowed to talk nonsense.</p>
<p>So what is so powerful about the end of the seventh path, or the so-called eighth path? It turns out that when kendo is practiced to this path, all ordinary techniques are abandoned, or rather, all are melted into a technique that does not speak of techniques. This technique is called "using the heart to wield the sword," which is similar to the Chinese Taijiquan method of "using the heart to guide the intention, using the intention to direct the qi, and using the qi to operate the five senses and hundreds of bones." What is the benefit of using the heart to wield the sword? It is the same as the Taijiquan method: "When the opponent does not move, I do not move; when the opponent wants to move, I move first." In other words, it is to use one's own intention to restrain the enemy's intention, and to wield the sword with one's spirit, so that the sword and the spirit are perfectly united. Therefore, it is said that Japanese "kendo" has indeed developed some not-so-small principles.</p>
