<p>卅七年度施政方針交付小組專案審查</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電」卅七年度政府施政方針，於卅日政務會議中提付討論，因內容包括州甚廣，限於時間，不克硏討，當決交由王雲五另行召集小組會議專案審查。據悉：該案內容共計卅六條，分兩大部份，一爲實施憲政，二為加強戡亂，係由中央設計局所草擬。</p>
<p>〔又電〕政院卅日晨決定繼續發行美金庫券後，兪財長告記者稱：在中央銀行外匯牌關價（即官價）未變更前，政府本可按支付日該行美金牌價折算付給國幣，但爲貫澈發行該項庫券之精神，幷昭示大信起見，故今晨政院會中經過詳細討論，決定辦法三項如下：（一）美金庫券改照指定銀行掛牌市價繼續發售。（二）該庫券到期本息改按指定銀行掛脾市價償還。（三）民國廿七年之英美金公債，廿九年英美建設公債，卅一年同盟勝利美金公債及美金儲券，均亦按照指定銀行掛脾市價折償本息，此種決定，固不免增加國庫負擔，但債信所關，故政府仍樂予實施，　望全國人民共體斯旨，踴躍認購，以完成國民在戡亂津國時間之使命。</p>
<h3>國民黨新建設綱領　內分三大部門決提四中全會討論</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕國民黨四中全會開幕在即，中常會經硏討制定「黨的新建設綱領」一案，決提交全會討論，頃探悉該案內容約分三大部門：一爲現况之檢討，二爲目前之組織綱領，三爲後期革命政治綱領。茲錄其內容大要如次：</p>
<p>（一）本黨現况之檢討略以自民十三年改組以來迄今業有廿三年，民十七年總登、記迄今亦已有十九年，故應加以新的活力之必要。檢討過去之黨務缺點約有五端。１。革命熱情不足，以至官僚政客得以混入，２.黨只重形式，幹部政策不能多予樹立，３.黨的紀律鬆弛，４.作風偏重現實，與實際政治脫節，５.黨內小組織意識濃厚。本黨為完成今後革命，實有振作之必要。</p>
<p>（二）本黨目前組織綱領中，關於黨員者分四項：１.黨員標準，２.劃分黨員的權利與義務，３.黨員財產登記——Ａ．特別注重幹部，從政黨員（服務於公營事業金融機關之黨員），。所報不實者，應予處分，４．黨員從新宣誓。乙，關於組織及運用包括十一點，主要者如次：Ａ卅七年五月五日召開第七屆全代會，Ｂ加強從政黨員管理，Ｃ總裁經常主持中常會，D　內幹部有能力之同志調查赴前方工作，E確立本黨幹部政策等項。丙，關於紀律者：１.開除跨黨份子並開除其黨籍，２.加強監　職權，３.凡開除黨籍份子在本　機間內不予任用，以爲制裁。</p>
<p>後期革命政治綱領共分六項：１.剿除共匪，明白規定剿除共匪，同時淸剿各地股匪及散匪，並改善官兵待遇公開軍需，２。鞏固國權，應提高國家民族地位，並與蘇聯切實交涉收回東北王權，３.肅淸貪汚，應注意提高監察官之權力及省縣議會向地方首長之質詞　與同　權，並切實改善公敎人員待遇。４.實行憲政，應確立省縣預算與財政制度，立即實旅省縣長民選。５．平均地權，以合作農塲改變目前耕種制度，完成地籍工作，實施征收地價稅，土地增値稅。６。節制資本，實行計劃經濟，嚴格限制投機　斷官僚資本之發展，實施統一財產稅及所得稅制度，依據社會政策改善勞動大衆生活。</p>
<h3>臨時政務會議泛論魏使聲明</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕魏使離華聲明中曾評及我政府貪汚與無一能，政院爲檢討地方政治及魏使聲明，特於卅日召集臨時政務會議，予以檢討，惟因政院積案過多，亟特討論，故僅作泛談，未獲結論。張　於討討論前致詞，張厲生等亦就地方政治之實况有所硏討。</p>
<h3>魏使在韓公忙　陸續接見各方代表</h3>
<p>〔新亞社漢城卅日電〕魏德邁陸使抵此問後，接見各方人士頗為忙碌，今（三十）日上午九時又接見民政長官安在鴻氏，安氏面交臨時政府報吿書一件，其內容包括政治·經濟·文化·敎育。土木工程·農業·勞動等各項問題，下午魏時使繼續接見佩人及團體之代表會談。迄發電時爲止，已接見者計有韓獨立黨代表，獨立促成會代表，女子國民黨代表，勤勞人民黨代表及李承晚等。又朝鮮臨時立法議會現在休會中，九月一日復會，屆時魏特使擬親到議會接見議員。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿九日電〕此間朝鮮問題硏究會主席金耀仁（譯音）在廿九日發表談話稱：渠希望魏德邁代表國能聽取朝鮮沈默大衆之呼聲，而朝鮮之中層階級與自由主義份子，能毫無保留地表示其希望與見解。渠稱，軍政府朝鮮顧問之意見，不能代表人民，因彼等大半多由反動人士之引薦，蓋後者彼時頗得朝鮮美當局之信任也。渠又特別指出，目前警察局方面之若干重要職員，多爲前日本政權時代之高等韓奸。</p>
<h3>平市長何思源赴頣和園養病</h3>
<p>〔本報北平卅日電〕北平市長何思源稱疾，赴頤和國養病已四”，傳近將赴京。</p>
<h3>孫科伉儷抵港</h3>
<p>〔中央社香港卅日電〕孫副主席伉儷偕男女公子等一行，三十日午十二時卅五分自穗乘專機抵港，日內飛京。</p>
<h3>台幣與法幣匯率改為一比七十二</h3>
<p>〔中央社台北卅日電〕據台灣銀行卅日宣布，台幣對法幣匯率自九月一日起舉令改爲一比七十二。</p>
<h3>陳誠今離京赴瀋　行前發表治理東北意見勗勉僚屬完成建軍目的</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三十日電〕兼東北行轅主任陳誠，定三十一日晨離京飛潘履新。三十日下午四時，在京東北人士特舉行歡送茶會，出席劉哲，馬亮，張潛華等“百餘人，陳氏即席致詞，渠首先對東北豐盛之物產予以贊揚，認爲吾人如無京北即等於無華北，如無華北即等於無中國，旋即就其赴東北之施政意見，有所陳述，略爲（一）政治方面力求以人民利益着想，不能離開人民，政府離開人民，即不成其為政府，故今後當力求與人民合作。（二）簡化機構部分，渠認為東北行政機構疊床架屋，設置過繁，在濟陽者除九省三市外，尙有政院各部特派員之機構，組織龐大，應有簡化之必要。（三）增加工作效率方面，尤其對於未收復各省之省府，現均設於瀋陽，實不利於工作之進行，故主各省府應設於各省區內。（四）經濟方面，擬以東北特產大豆與煤運出，以換取關內之機器，棉布及麵粉，藉使東北經濟可陶穩定。陳氏之結論爲肅淸共匪，收復失地，澄淸吏治，簡化機構，懲治貪汚，維持軍紀等。旋由于斌代表答詞，除致歡迎之意外，並強調東北民衆決能配合陳氏之指揮，做到軍民合作，達成陳氏任務，至下午五時歡散。</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕據軍聞社訊：陳誠三十日在東北人士歡送會上稱：吾人願以極大犧牲，無論如何困難，東北務須自叛逆之手中收　，貫澈抗戰時之願望，此目標一日未達到，吾人之責任即一日未完成，盼全體東北人士齊心合力，朝此目標邁進，今日東北而臨之一切，較過去日本侵佔下之情形尤爲嚴重，今後東北將仍以軍事爲主，然對於政治，經濟與爭取人心，謀取人民幸福各方面，亦將竭盡心力，盡瘁到底。目前東北駢枝機構太多，現已擬定三項計劃，（一）政治，經濟二委員會取消，改組成立政務局。（二）政治，經濟二會均撤消，不另設機構。（三）兩會仍屬行轅管轄。東北未收復區之各省市政府與黨部，團部，現在瀋陽辦公，此種情形亦已有兩項建議；一，各地方機關，均應隨軍推至接近省區地帶辦公。二，如仍留瀋陽，則均行合併，積極辦公。以上建議將呈請最高當一局核定。關於經濟方面，陳氏稱：此次在東北發現目目前東北最迫切需要者，爲糧食，布疋與機器，尤以機器更爲孔急，盼中央能設法恢復重建東北工業，則必能增加生產，摧毀共匪，其他如改善人民生活，軍民合作，亦必全力以赴。</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕據軍聞社訊：國府明令參謀總長陳誠兼任東北行轅主任，蔣主席並於當晚召見陳總長，面示東北軍事重要機宜，陳總長以奉命啓程在即，三十日上午九時在該部大禮堂召集所　各廳局及陸海空聯勤各總部少校以上官佐致訓，到各官左一千四百三十餘人，陳總長一身着戎裝，蒞塲致訓，首先檢討國防部成立十五個月以來一般業務之成果，旋懇切勗勉僚屬繼續努力，完成軍中人事制度，以建設現代化約國軍。後謂：今後仍應着重節約與整飭軍風紀，以期達成建軍建國之目的，以鞏固國防，建立強盛的新中國，至九時許方散。</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕陳誠卅日晨於召集國防部所屬官佐訓話時稱：國防部過去十五月中，主要工作有二，其一爲裁併機構，國防部原有機構萬餘單位，經逐漸縮併，已减至五千餘單位，其二爲戰編軍隊，此一工作本已進行至相當程度，將來仍將繼續。陳氏希望於三年內完成國防制度，此事應自三方面努力，（一）確立人事制度，對軍官退役，除役，應認眞辦理，陳指出新陳代謝作困之重要，湘淮軍及袁世凱小站練兵，固曾盛極一時，然曾幾何時，即吿衰退。國民革命軍成立以來，已歷廿載，有人批評其亦已衰退，我人若能重視軍官退役，除役，當能發生新陳代謝作用。（二）確立補給制度，軍官兼理補給，諸多不適補給制度，應設法建立。（三）確立敎育制度，今後當以國家爲重，陳氏今日訓話時，對軍風紀敗壞表示應予澈底整飭，並盼能在各方面厲行簡約，軍官所入無幾，宴會應力求節約，即對軍器，亦應盡力保管。最後陳氏又談及魏德邁臨別贈言，盼上下能痛自反省。</p>
<p>〔本本報長春三十電〕吉臨參會以陳誠兼任行轅主任，特電馳賀，並以「行見刷新吏治，消滅奸匪，收復整個東北」相期許</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽三十日電〕東北行轅結束事務辦完，準備移交，秘書長胡家鳳，政委會主任秘書溫晋城，主任辦公室主任許鵬飛均請辭。</p>
<h3>職團選舉名額問題　立院復會後決定　婦女團體限制將予修改</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕谷部長正潮卅日　見記者談職業團體選舉問題稱，職業團體代表名額問題，須俟立院復會後始得解決，然各種職業代表以商會組織為最普　亦最健全，而商業團體國大名額僅十三人，立委僅五人，分配似嫌過少。社部將一本國府指示及各方要求，與立院商洽此事，相信最近定可獲致適當解決。又關於國大婦女團體，全國性婦女團體「以在各省市有五個以上分會，其分會名册報部有案者爲限」一點，根據人民團體組織法，婦女團體爲普通團體，不必如職業團體必須有基層組織，立院所規定者與國府頒布之人民團體組織法有所不合。本部近會就此與立院有所洽商，亦可望獲得適當辦法。關於新聞記者法，本部近會與內部會商，將來新聞記者資格可能將廣播記者列入。</p>
<h3>颱風在福州登陸　預測今晨將到達南京</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京卅日電〕美陸軍第四十三氣象組報告稱，三十日晨東京時問三時，「伊內茲」颱風已到達中國之福州地區。風向已稍向西北移動，時速十六哩，星期日上午三時可至南京迤南一百哩之地。</p>
<p>〔本報福州卅日電〕太平洋　風自台灣海面西侵閩海，廿八日晚在榕厦一帶登陸，風力強勁達十一級。榕市昨竟日狂風呼嘯，大雨驟至，拔樹倒屋，商店停業，市景悽然。海上波濤汹湧，各綫船隻均暫停開。昨日電訊中斷，記者發電被阻。今日風勢漸弱，及時而雨，農民喜慶甘霖，秋收有望。</p>
<p>〔本報杭州三十日電〕今昨颱風過杭嘉，午中錢江大灌，潮水　湧，杭市四堡處海塘亦吿急。該處原有之三四里漲沙已坍盡。潮水已浸及公路，因該處並無石塘保護，故情勢頗見危急，現塘工局正嚴密防範中。</p>
<h3>馬占山談話　東北匪醞釀六次攻勢</h3>
<p>〔本報北平卅日電〕馬占山廿七日自瀋飛平療疾，擬稍事休養後即返瀋。馬氏卅日接見記者稱：東北共匪確在多處醖釀六次攻勢，惟東北已增加王鐵漢，周策成兩軍，原有各軍缺額亦經補充完畢，實力大見增強，今後又得陳總長親往主持，東北情形可望日見穩定。談及松北綏靖事，馬氏稱：松北綏靖總司令部，兩月前已奉國防部令成立，惟迄今尙未展開工作，編制方面有六處，另配屬新聞等處計八處，各處處長大致內定，參謀長范玉書，係前保安長官部副參謀長，將來總部將設長春，所屬部隊尙待上峯調撥。馬氏末稱：刻松北地下軍，以械彈不濟，多轉戰南滿一帶，力量亟待充實。</p>
<p>〔本報長春卅日電〕烏拉街北部有戰事，爲匪周保中部，由大孤岔子向小三家　擾，刻正激戰中。另西安以西平崗之匪，連日以小股向西　作試探性之攻擊。</p>
<h3>第三批分配艦昨晨在青接收</h3>
<p>〔中央社靑島三十日電〕第三批日分配艦八艘，三十晨八時在青市舉行接收典禮。</p>
<h3>美國務院公布駐華外交人員</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿九日電〕美國務院公布新近委任之外交人員之名，將擔任駐華職務赴南京者，計有克萊恩及蘭卡斯特爾，並派斯考特赴合北美領事誼工作。</p>
<h3>美為自身權益實應支持中國　霍華德系報呼籲援華</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓卅日電〕霍華德系報社評稱，美國對中國必須有所作爲，否則祗能退出亞洲。中國國民政府固有許多缺點，然而在全世界分成美蘇對立兩陣綫之時，從美國之觀點而言，有一重要點爲正確者：蔣主席乃在美國陣綫之內。空軍戰略家認爲不支持友善之中國政府實爲愚蠢，如若中共之勢力蔓延至黃河，則已縮小之國　然區，即不能自衛，美國亦將受災，反之友善之中國殲續糧權，美國仍能應用空軍基地，使Ｂ２９型可隨時到達西伯利亞各點，則蘇聯即不敢冒戰爭之險矣。</p>
<h3>廣東的憧憬　南遊雜草之四…</h3>
<p>— 卜少夫</p>
<p>有一種遠視的觀察結論在這里互相傳告着：</p>
<p>假使第三次世界大戰爆發，假使美蘇是主要的火併脚色，其戰塲將在朝鮮，我們的東北，甚至西北，那個時候，我們抗戰的大後方不是在西南的川滇黔，而將是華南的兩廣，廣州可能成爲戰都。</p>
<p>這個結論具有很強的媚惑性和剌戰力。</p>
<p>扒負起第三次世界大戰中國大後方的任務是艱鉅的，這幕遠景却鼓勵着廣東當局的努力於建設工作，我不敢說那個「廣東省五年建設計劃」是由於這個因素而起的，我知道我們的抗戰業已盼利，建設猶待完成，這是我們的國策，但這個傳吿是有相當影響的。</p>
<p>我在廣州期間，不止一次遇到停電及　如豆的情形，而發生這樣情形的地點，有最熱鬧市區的大酒樓，有某局長的公館，我曾經以此詢問過好幾個本地人，他們的答覆和主席羅卓英先生的答覆沒有兩樣——缺煤。據耀先生說，廣東現在靠湖南的煤；而粵漢路部佔去大宗的消耗，車皮不够，交通發生故障時，煤的來源便更困難了。這個問題引起我的興味，經濟建設脫離不了動力，動力中煤是最重要的原料了，廣東究有多少儲量呢？</p>
<p>「廣東省五年建設計劃」（省政府經百餘專家學者縝密硏究閱時八月，始吿完成。）中礦業類煤礦項內有這麽一段說明；</p>
<p>『……本省產煤，爲數至微，與世界各國，幾至無可此較（年產二十萬噸）……本省煤礦儲量，據廿三年礦業紀要統計，列居全國第二十二位，共四二一·〇〇〇·〇〇〇瓪。其中烟烘約占百分之九十，無烟煤約占百分之十。無烟煤前只供給燒石灰及家庭炊事之用，但稍加配合，即可達至工業用途。烟煤雖占儲量中之多數，然大部份仍屬半無烟煤，其可供煉焦，備冶金用之烟煤，仍屬少數。</p>
<p>四億噸的儲藏量，能作「工業用途」有多少，專家學者還沒有一個，首定　答案，這頗令人惶惑於夫來廣東工業建設的獨立性的。倚存性也好，獨立性也好，廣東的地下資源還在埋藏着，地上人們的生話起居不够水準，要辦的事實在太多了，一言以蔽之，廣東需要開發，需要建設，按照省政府的第一期五年計劃，（共有四個五年計劃），假使如期在民國四十年完成的話，即使遇到像今年的永災，也不致緊迫到向省外呼籲請求救濟那樣嚴重了。</p>
<p>建設的計劃，到目前爲止，可說並沒有在決定性的具體進行，空氣自然是非常濃厚，特別是外資和僑一資的活動，我在香港，在海口，都聽到類似的意向。外資和僑資看中了廣東這塊地方，不能不說很有很光，不過他們還有一種顧慮，那就是治安問題。這是爲資本的安全着想的。此外，需要政府對經營有一種保障，那是爲了利益的安全着想的。在這兩個前經未獲得把握之前，外資和僑資可能始終　等徊　顧而趦趄不前</p>
<p>就在我所下宿的東關招待所，曾經住　一位省政府的貴賓——美國漢黎少校，他是代表美國的若干投資家來和廣東省政府談判合作，建設工磋事　的。這個談判遠在去年夏季　開始，到現在，初步的草的業已簽訂——省政府曾向　央各部會請示，得到同意的，賸下來的問題就是漢黎公司在美國註册正式成立，集資和運送機械到中國來了。</p>
<p>建設廳長謝文龍先生是參預此次談判的主要代表之一，直到我離開廣州，沒有找到機　和他一談漢黎公司的究竟，不過我知道羅卓英先生爲這件事向內央陳述而得到通過，是　費了一番唇舌的。對廣東本省也正復相同。因爲無論中央或地方，對於外資總有一種矛盾的心理，一方面是歡迎，另方而是畏懼，在這矛盾心理之下，若干計劃和機會是被扼殺或擱置下來了。漢黎公司與廣東東省政府合作簽訂的初）步草約內容，我不悉其詳，但我知道有兩項原則獲得雙方同意的：第一，在若干年內（大概十年左右），粵省可陸續收回各廠美股，而美股總額不得超過總資本百分之五十以上；第二，各廠土地廠房建築等全部由粵有担任，工作人員除少數工程師技師外，亦全部由粵省担任。漢黎少校帶着那張草約回美國去了、祗留下幾個少數助手在香港和廣州</p>
<p>黎本身並不是資本家，不過他與美國進出口銀行當局有淵源，在美國也有相當號召力，現在旣得到廣東省政府合作的保護，進行起來當然不會有什麼困難的。其實除漢黎外，不少英美人士都願意到廣東來投資，據廣東省銀行行長劉佐人先生吿訴我，和他私人作類似接洽的就有四起，其中一個是英國人。這些人不是本身很有錢，即是在此次戰爭中發了很大的戰爭財，他們爲了希冀逃避本國政府苛重的財產稅，都非常急切地想把資財移到中國來，倘使再能因此而獲利，那豈不更好。所以他們熱乎是迫不急待，而他們的政府却一再組止，說：慢慢來，看看中國的局勢再定漲！</p>
<p>華僑返國投資，不僅是主觀上的必然現象，一個中國人有了錢，葉落歸根，當然得回到祖國來，用在祖國的土地上；而且也是客觀上的必然趨勢，在這次大戰中及戰後華僑們痛切感到在海外身家財產的無保障，尤其是戰後各地汹湧澎湃的民族自決運動，華僑們的處境，像是一塊三明治，遭受兩面夾壓，痛苦非凡，倘使祖國給予投資的保陣和利便，他們一定會不惜像其所有拿回來的。可是若干年來，我們一直在喊着歡迎華僑回國投資，我們能舉出幾件有成就的事業是這一運動的產物呢？就在我這次旅行中，在海南島，我還聽到一件關於華僑投資的不愉快事件，有個華僑開發公司（？）戰前在文昌購置了若干畝的土地，預備從事經營農塲，這些土地都有正式的契紙，有廣東省財政廳和財政部的證明，後來因爲戰事，繼之淪陷，不得不暫吿中止，勝利後回到海南島來，文昌本地有幾個人却出來阻止，說他產權有問題，縣政府調解沒有結果，地方法院判他敗訴，高分院却又不負責的發回更審，曠時費日，這個公司幾個負責人幾乎要急得發瘋了。</p>
<p>廣東有遠景的，除計劃外，大家都知道在運用上外資和僑資是不可忽略的兩個主要力量，外資和僑資也都願意來，間題是在我們能不能給予保障和便利了。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>自力更生吧！</h3>
<p>前天國務會議，由蔣主席親臨主持，對於當前的內政外交方針，有重要的新決策：昨日政務會議，繼續作更詳盡的檢討。據各方面的報道，今後政府施政，將注重下列各端：（一）着重自力更生，外國貸款須無政治條件，始可接受：（二）努力改革政治，勵精圖治，對非綏靖區之致治，特別儘速整頓，尤其對於貪汚，力求肅淸：（三）綏靖區之軍事，將加緊進剿：（四）如期舉行普選，俾使政治民主化。這幾項原則，果能切實施行，則我國的政治，自能面目一新，走上更生的大道。但這些原則，今天已不貴空談而貴實行。如何使之實行？不僅要靠政府的努力，而且選要憑著人民的自覺與決心。</p>
<p>母席諱言，當魏德邁特使於七月下旬奉命來華調査之初，中國人民對於美國的援助，抱着極大的希望，大家都以爲美國當能助我經濟建設，以渡過目前的難關。但魏特使留華一月之後，發表他的臨別贈言，使大家的希望似乎變成了泡影。於是希望美國援助的心理，一變而爲要求政府自力更生了。】其實，這個心理上的轉變，原是人情之常。並且我們認爲只有先能够自力更生，則外援將不求而自至。中國在戰後的復興，自然需要外援的，而且正如第一次世界大戰後一樣，中國實業的開發實在歡迎國際資本與技術的合作的，故中國今天回頭來先求自力更生，並不是憑着意氣，，有絲毫排外的意味在內。尤其中國之與美國，交誼原非泛泛，我們果眞能自力更生，則美國盟友到那時也必會「錦上添花」的。</p>
<p>我們對於魏特使的臨別贈言，反覆誦讀，感慨萬千。目前雖還不知道政府的熊度如何，但我們總覺得魏特使的來華似乎徒勞往返，多此一舉，魏特使所以作此聲明，據合衆社漢斯雷君華盛頓專電的報道，似乎推測他含有甚深的用意。他要求兩點：（一）對中共要求牠放棄武力：（二）對國民政府要求政治經濟的澈底改革。他彷彿想拿這個文件，爲國民政府要求美國援助開了一條道路，就是實行改革。其實，就迄兩點而論，都不是「新事實」，更無待一個月來的訪求。中共之不願自動放棄武力，早爲中外周知的事實，剿共必須七分政治三分軍事，更爲蔣主席當年在江西剿匪時所定的方針。中共旣不能自動放下武器，中國人民自須擁護政府加強剿匪的工作，迫使中共放下武器而後已。至於政府所作政治經濟的改革，在國民大會制頒憲法以後，正在逐步進行，今後亦惟有求其在我，使我們的行政效率更能加強，使我們的社會風尙更能符合於艱苦的戰時生活</p>
<p>但是，我們儘管盡其在我，却不能不指出美國對於中國內亂的釀成與擴大，有其道義上的責任。中共匪徒之所以坐大，原因有二：（一）爲得力於不符實情的「和談」，使其能在一年之間擴充實力，而此促勸「和談」正爲美國當局對華政策得意之筆。（二）爲得力於蘇聯霸佔東北以後之援助，而蘇聯之所以有此機會，乃由於美國在雅爾達會議中之「出賣」中國盟友。故中國今日內亂之擴大，我們雖然應該痛加自責，而就和平不可分割的國際因素來說，美國也應負相當的責任。魏特使對於這些中共坐大原因的事實，並無分析，對於如可解濯這些事實的具體辦法，並　無說明，面僅發表若干皮相的老生常談，以爲美國暫不援華　等一根據，究於大局有何裨益？</p>
<p>我們再退一步而論，魏特使的臨別贈言，我們信共爲出於好意，可以看作他對於中國政府的諍言，但不待回美，而用如此口脗說話，未免不智。紐約泰晤士報也會稱魏氏聲明，無異對中國政府提出最後通牒，追令中國政府改革。中國的一切誠需改革，但是否必須全如美國朋友的意思而改革，是否要使中國人的生活方式完全變成美國人的生活方式，中國政府的一切制度完全改成美國制度而後快？須知中國政治經濟的改革是一事，而美國之欲以一美元外交」通令中國接受其命令與敎訊則爲另一事。最近英國拒不接受美國的貸款，同時美國對於貸款的方式也愈來愈嚴格，不是附有政治條件，就是要求監督其用途，這些事實，使我們不能不漸漸相信，美國之貸款與他國，並不基於他國人民的禍幸，也並不着眼於雙方互利與世界大局，而僅僅打他自身一時利害的算盤。實則全世界果眞都窮，沒有了「美元」，則美國將爲生產過剩，亦將重遭絕大的經濟危機！</p>
<p>現在我們就得反躬目省了！我們從魏特使的爽辣聲明裏，可以得到許多有益的敎訓。第一，我們中國人民對於交友之道，向來看重「忠」「信」兩字，我們把美國看作自己的知友，以爲牠當知「雪中送炭」，殊不料美國也只是一個「有事有人，無事無人」的朋友。第二，在現行國際形勢之下，「國際合作」「世界和平」還不過是高調，中國若欲維護領土主權之完整，就得自強不息，萬萬不可有絲毫依賴外國的念頭。第三，在不損害主權與國格的條件下，固可以接受外國的援助，但我們非至萬不得已，決不可輕易接受外國的貸款。中國人有句俗語，一窮要窮得硬朗」。嗟來之食，我們是不願吃的！</p>

<p>浦江訪「鬼」記  雨崑　　靜靜的蘇州河，爲了「鬼」的出現，一夜竟閙了五六次，不僅蘇州河內的船戶，在萬分恐懼的心理狀態下，不能安眠；就是住在百老滙大樓裏的許多外國記者，也被這些嘈雜的呌囂驚醒了。起初都莫明其妙，淸晨翻開大陸報，才知道浦江閙鬼。他們雖然不相信有鬼神，但爲好奇心所　使，決定到黄浦江上去訪問一次。　　法國新聞社記者白禮柴先生，也是其中的一個，看完了大陸報的記載之後，感到極大的興趣，假如把這個無稽的故事，寫成長篇的通訊，寄到巴黎去，在報章雜誌發表，一定能獲得大批讀者的歡迎。因此白禮柴先生決定去訪問，並要我陪他去。　　我們先到水上警察分局去訪問，承一位何先生接見，他把這個無稽的流言和荒誕的故事，說得很詳盡，並且暗示我們一個新聞的綫索；因此我們便決定呌一艘汽油艇，到白蓮涇去訪問，調査逍個無稽的流言，是怎樣傳出來的？　　我們坐在小汽油艇裹，淸風徐來，忘記了初秋的燠熱；白禮柴先生對於浦江的風景，似乎也非常賞識。經過三刻鐘的航行，我們到了白蓮涇；我們先到楊思分局訪問，後來在茶樓與茶客閑談；千句併一句，只聽到關於「鬼」的傳說，但沒有看到「鬼」的形跡。　　從高低不平的羊腸小道走到碼頭，遇到許多男女老幼，聽到我們來訪「鬼」，他們都以肯定的口吻，表示浦江上確有「鬼」出現，並證明前晚也有「鬼」出現，只是僅伸出一隻有毛的巨手，向船艙裹拉小兒或女人，但是轉瞬之間，忽然不見。　　白禮柴先生初次深入我國農村社會，看到他們的實際生活，認爲中國當務之丞，首在改善人民生活，普及敎育，才能使政治走上眞正民主的道路。　　往來浦江兩小時，化了二十萬元的代價，訪「鬼」「鬼」未見，僅聽到千篇一律的傳說，我認爲這次採訪新聞，可以說完全失敗了。但是在白禮柴先生，他所撰述的故事，不久就可在巴黎發表；他是不承認失敗的。　　編老按：「鬼閙黄浦江」這是對原子時代的嘲笑，當然是一件幼稚無稽的謠言。但從這謠言上，我們民衆敎育的低落，表現得是如何地愚蠢與可憐。自由談莫斯科女子理髮師　仍看重小賑  柴扉譯　　小賬制度向被人認爲是資本主義社會的劣跡之一，此在實行共產主義的蘇聯，迄今亦不能完全取消。在莫斯科的旅館司閽，茶房，理髮匠以及其他對顧客從事私人服務的人們，都希望得到小賬，聽主顧隨償。　　按理講，在蘇聊，小賬制度是不合法的，但是在莫斯科理髮室，旅館以及其他社交塲所，小賬仍風行無阻，毫不受法律的束縛。　　假如你給顧客髮理得迅捷，用鋒利的剃刀將面修得光滑，同時阿諛奉承，禮貌周到的話，那末理髮匠將會得到兩倍或四倍於理髮費的小賬，正如同在舊金山·烏瑪哈等地一樣。　　莫斯科的理髮店，由市政府管理，計分三等，大多由女子任理髮匠，她們薪水的高低，根據她們理髮的經騐，技術與速度來決定；同時論件計值，辛勤一點的當然可以多得一點薪水。　　一個顧客進理髮店，由一個輪班的理髮西施給他理髮修臉，他不能指定那一個給他理，他也無從知道那一個技術較爲高明，那一個技術較次一等。在頭等理髮店，一個女性的或男性的理髮匠每做一個盧布（等於一百戈比），可拆四十三戈比的賬，二等理髮店可拆三十九戈比，三等可拆三十三戈比。他們每日工作八小時，每工作六天休息一天，大多理髮店上午七點半開門，到晚上十一點關門。　　技術高超的理髮西施每月收入約一千餘盧布，平均計算起來，她們的收人較蘇聯公務人員以及國營工業服務人員高出約三分之一，她們每月小賬收入或者在一一千盧布以。　　因爲盧布通貨的膨脹，根據理髮費金額付給小賬是隨顧客高興的。外國人在莫斯科理一次髮化費兩盧布，理髮西施則希望得到十個盧布的小賬。蘇聯本國人理髮。——莫是共產黨員——則不一定給小賬，因爲按照他們的政治與道德歡念，他們反對小脹制。但是願意給賞的先生們，一次總賞給五盧布至十盧布。　　如果理髮十西施工作勤勞，成績超過每日應理量，那末　將得到「斯坦哈諾夫」的榮譽獎。得到這個榮譽獎，她還可以獲得超量的布以及其他消費品的配給，買假期旅行車票，也可享受减價的優待。　　我的理髮西施，在莫斯科嬰算是最合標準的，對我申述她的身世，她是一個市立理髮學校的畢業生，在校訓練計六個月。學校不收學費，訓練時期由學校津貼生活用費，假如有人願意進學校呌學生們理髮，那末他們是不收理髮費的。　　莫斯科分十一區，每區有十至二十家市立理髮店，從理髮學校出來的畢業生就分派到這些市立理髮店去服務。　　離莫斯科中心較遠的區域，或在鄕間理髮店很少收小賬的，如果這些理髮店的理髮匠聽到蕊斯科理髮店中的同志領受三五個盧布的小賬，那末他們一定會咒詛城中的同志們一定是甲了資本主義細菌的毒了！（譯世事彙報）這就是你  東方荊　　人的脈搏跳動次數，是隨了年齡和性別而變化的；初生的嬰兒，每分鐘脈搏跳一百三十五次，以後逐漸减少，到了發育成熱以後，脈搏每分鐘跳七十二次；到了老年時期，又升高到每分鐘跳七十六次。女子脈搏跳動的次數，平均都較男子爲低。　　人體內的血管，多得也許出乎你的意料。因爲把人體內的血管連接起來，足足有二千哩長。心臟在二十四小時中，跳動十萬三千六百八十次。　　人體中的各個部份，只有在中耳內的三根小「耳骨」，一生下來時，就已充份發育完成。　　人的脚，很少有一英尺長的。雖然，據醫學的紀錄，成人的脚，最大的達十二英吋又五分之二，最小的爲七英吋又五分之三，不過平均，成人的脚爲十英寸半長。　　人每天平均呼吸二萬五千九百二十次，所吸入的空氣，達四百五十立方英尺。　　人每分鐘要霎眼二十五次，每霎眼一次約佔五分之一秒的時間。照這樣算起來，就是在你醒着的時候，每一小時中，也有五分鐘是閉着眼睛的。　　人生七十古老稀，要活到一百歲是更不容易了。據統計，每三百萬人中，只有三十個人活到一百歲，而其中有三分之二以上是女人。　　人死了以後，並不是整個身體都立刻死去。腦子還可以在人斷氣後多活十分鐘，心臟肌多活二十分鐘，腿臂的肌肉多活四小時，胃還能繼續消化二十四小時，骨骼還可以多活三天，皮膚多活五天。這就是你。頑貓阿咪（十五）  張樂平作影壇一週  李箴　　一週中最佳片「血灑杳箋」　　上週所換上去的許多新片中，無疑地「血　香箋」是一張最佳的片子了，不僅是因爲曾被推選爲一九四五年的十大名片之一，而從整個片子的演出上，實在使人可以相當滿意的。整個戲的情調氣氛，導演的處理都是恰到好處的。看過「重逢有日」的觀衆對導演威廉寶台爾的優秀手法，一定早己有了很深的喜愛，那末這部片子你將不會把它輕輕放過的。　　本片的成功，除了導演之外，男女主角的優越成績是不可抹煞的。女主角　妮茀　絲對人物性格把握的深湛，使這個角色瘦得最完美的創造。男主角約瑟夫考登的穩實洗練的演技，使演出更爲相得益彰。　　自然在劇本的編製上，有著缺點的，女主角的突患健忘病，一個牽强不妥的安排，但故事的纏綿動人，淸　　實，都是這個戲的好處。　　攝影與置景，均爲上乘之作。　　並不出色的「銀漢笙歌」　　這是一部音樂傳記片。以美國近代歌劇作者吉隆寇恩的一生事蹟爲題材，並以十三個大明星的會串作號召，在片中插入了許多電影上的名曲舞劇，如果作爲一張歌舞片看，那末這部戲的情節與穿插尙不使人討厭，假使作爲一張傳記片，這故事是相當平淡的。吉隆寇恩的奮鬥與發展，看來並無怎樣出人頭地之處，平平淡淡，並無可以誇耀的地方。　　故事架空的「毀滅」　　又是一張描寫飲酒有害的片子，不過這裏與「失去的週末」不同的是主角換了個女的，她是夜總會的歌星，起先是爲了壯胆飲酒，後來是爲了妬嫉酗酒，因此變成了嗜酒如命，結果失去了一切。我們暫不管編劇者所說敎的目的，以這人物的一切行爲來分析，就顯得非常免强，而故事的架空，更是這個劇本失敗的主因。　　五彩西部片「血染金沙」　　「血染金沙」是以十九世紀中葉美洲的移民爲題材”故事內容　寫那些開發新大陸的兒女英雄的英勇事蹟，自然少不了一段三角戀愛的故事，及印弟安土人的如何野蠻殘暴，但劇作者似乎忘掉了那個白人惡徒何等格姦殺土人女子後，印第安土人的　衆報復，並不是一件善惡的事情，而這些移民英雄，憑着現代化的武力，把他們征服，這難道是一件正義的行為嗎？　　導演對戲的處理，不能全盤控制，這是導演的失敗地方，但這部片子中許多壯麗的塲面，與極爲優美的畫面，是値得一提的。此片攝影甚佳。　　演員申但那安德路，白拉恩唐里凡，蘇姗海華，潘德麗茜格克，四人均有較佳演出。尤以二女主角的丰姿艷麗，與大自然美景的配合，生色不少。社會服務徵求人才　　中華職業敎育社上海職業指導所，近受各方委託物色下列人才，凡住居本市有志應徵者，請速往雁蕩路（華龍路）八十號二樓二〇二室該所面洽，在外埠者因時間關係，暫不函洽。　　（一）某中學高中數理敎員，以大學數理系畢業，年齡在四十歲左右者爲合格。（二）某公館女傭一人，以能燒洗，並帶領小孩者爲合格。（三）某公司男性中文打字員一人，以技能熟練，書法挺秀者爲合格。（四）某工廠女工宿舍管門一人，需體格健全，身材高大，年齡在四十左右之女性爲合格。（五）台灣某中學英文數理敎員一人。　　（一）某機關徵男性修理馬達電工及引擎管理各一人，以技術熟練爲合格，待遇底薪六十元，照生活指數加成供住及服裝。（二）南洋某廠徵男性火柴技師一人，以曾在火柴廠工作五年以上有監製經騐英語流利者爲合格，待遇荷幣一千盾，供到職旅費。（三）某社徵男性製鋅版技工數人，以年在四十以下具有工作經騐爲合格，待遇面議。（四）某工程公司徵男性柴油機匠一人，能開及修理柴油機須有證明文件者爲合格，待遇二百五十萬元供膳宿。（五）某醫院徵藥　生一人，以領有衛生咢執照爲合格曰，待遇六十萬，供膳宿。（六）浙江奉化某中學徵男性數種敎員一人，以大學理工科畢業能敎高三程度課程爲合格，待遇七十萬元，供膳宿。（七）某社團微女性打字員一人，以高中畢業具有中（萬能式）英文打字技能，年在卅以下者爲合格，待遇一百萬供膳。（八）浦東某宅徵女性看護一人，以初中程度有育嬰常識年在四十五以下爲合格，待遇六十萬。　本市汾陽路某宅徵女性保姆一人，略識字有領育小孩經騐者爲合格，待遇三十萬元，供膳宿。　　（未完）色盲落第　小便變色　　讀者張蓮甫君，以投考公共汽車售票員，筆試口試均已及格，不料體格檢査時，以患有色盲，終於未能錄取。又讀者楊千載君，以數月來小便奇臭，其色混濁，而從未間花尋柳，深以爲怪。先後來函詢間，茲特分別簡答於後：　　（一）色盲係屬眼病，其病源多爲遺傳性。几對一切色彩，視之皆如一色或無色，而莫由辨別者，曰全色盲；其不能辨別一部分之）原（色者，曰半色盲，最多者爲紅綠色盲；每有能辨深紅深綠，而不辨淡紅淡綠者。總之，對色覺不完全者。即患有色盲。至所所詢色盲爲何種攻試所必須檢査一點，無從置答。　　（二）正常之尿，淸澄透明，其色帶黄，放置罐內，經時愈久，則愈溷濁。如尿量减少，尿濃厚時，其色爲黄赤。如因服藥作用，尿色變常者有之。如已在膀胱內分解之尿，有阿母尼亞臭十氣。尊恙恐爲膀胱炎，希就醫診治之，並檢騐小便，以明空間。至所詢之另一毛病，旣爲庸醫所誤，已無可補救。讀者信箱　　上海趙家竑君鑒：函悉。（一）初期肺結核，及早治療，十之七八可獲痊愈，希即就醫診治之。（二）狐臭似無特效藥。（三）此係體質不能與氣候變化相適應所致。（四）一般人對日光浴每有誤解，總之應遵照醫師之指示方可，並非肺癆病人皆可施行。　　漢中揚旭村君鑒：所詢Fibrolysin，上海科發藥房有售，係德國怡　克廠出品，其効用能溶化皮膚結疤肉疣，及因結疤而起之　節强直，胃門窄狹，癒着之肋膜等；對於眼科，治綠內障，角膜炎，角膜溷濁，直膜炎，亦有效。所詢蟹足腫，想係外科結疤之一種。兩廣水災捐款　　大同紗廠全體職工五百萬元，姚先生三十萬元，徐華等十七人十七萬元，汪　人十萬元，威覲宸十萬元，鄭一福記十萬元，王國楨五萬元，沈生雲四萬元，局券波二萬元，陳德馨一萬五千元，以上共收五百八十九萬五千元。服務簡訊　　義校聘敎師　南市某義務小學，添聘高級敎師一位，供膳宿，酌給教薪，如願受聘者，向漢口路三〇九號董君接洽。　　電台收費廉　靑年電台在古拔路四三號，爲一花園住宅，環境極佳，因最近成立，價自特別便宜，特別節目自上午七八時起至午夜十二時，任何日均可。（不限星期“）電費運一切開支在內，凈付一百四十萬元。</p>

<p>春秋歌德人格之啓示  閻哲吾　　——爲八月廿八日歌德誕辰作　　翻開世界文學史一看，便知道歐洲古今有四位劃時代的天才的偉大詩人：古代有荷馬，十三世紀有但丁，十六世紀有莎士比亞，于八世紀還有與拿破崙並世齊名的多面奇才——歌德。　　歌德生於一七四九年八月廿八日，在德國，乃至蘇聯，歐洲各國，每逢這日子皆有盛大的慶祝紀念，他的確是一位蓋世的文壇奇才，也是德國文壇的聖傑——因爲在德國未產生歌德以前，一直是被法國及其他歐洲國家，認爲是「最愚蠢之民族」，可是一發現了歌德，他竟被稱爲「歐洲文壇之玉」——拿破崙也說：「這不愧爲一個人」！　　歌德的一生，博學多才，他是政治家，思想家，科學家詩人；他是顏色學家，動物學家，礦物學家，植物學家，地質學家，他硏究過哲學，法律，醫學，而全人格却完全表露在畢身的文學作品中。惟其各種生活，他都有過嘗試而體騐豐富，但在各方面工作中，最後沒有失却他的「自己」！　　整個的歌德人格，其實是無數的歌德連續完成的。少年歌德不同於老年歌德，而他從小到老，又有大學學生的歌德，少年維特的歌德，魏瑪朝廷的歌德，意大利旅行中的歌德，與席勒相交時的歌德，艾德曼談話中的聖人歌德……，而歌德每一次生活的變遷，就啓示一次人生生活上的重大意義。　　歌德的人生，是永恒的變遷，但當他對每一種新生活有了新傾向後，都是以全副精神，整個人格浸沉在裏面的。他一生的思想，情感與理智，時在矛盾，衝突，苦悶，不滿足，最後總是毅然地割捨舊的，而急流勇退地，更勇進入於另一新的追求。所以說，歌德的一生，並非從錯誤走到眞理，乃是繼續地經歷全人生各式的形態。這種人格的永恒的變遷，在歌德的「浮士德」裏也曾自白過：　　「我要在內在的自我中深深領略，領略全人類所賦有的一切，最崇高的最深遠的我都要了解，我要把全人類的苦樂堆積在我的胸心，我的小我便擴大成爲全人類的大我。我願和全人類，最後歸於消滅。」　　這種偉大的追求生活之多而化，而肯定生命之意義，不斷地追求，使矛盾常歸於和諧，而樂觀地執着流轉的萬象，承受一切的苦樂，敢縱身在時代的奔波與事變的車輪之下，而永遠地正視前程，握着奔馳的命運之韁繩，驅車前進走向無盡。這種人生戰塲的勇士精神也是詩人的光輝照耀，實在値得我們崇敬與學習。哭母親  田地　　——並控訴中共罪行　　『中華民國三十五年七月二十五（農曆六月二十七）日深夜，田袁傳筠一位五十歲的婦人，與另外三個年老的受難者，同在當時中共所控制的區域，來安古城裹所謂蘇皖邊區政府無辜地槍殺了，這只是中共在皖東千萬次慘殺案中的一次……』　　去年夏季，一個暴風雨的夜裏，在所謂蘇皖解放區的境內——來安縣古城，我親愛的母親，一位慈祥善良的老婦人，被以前進以革命以解放等口號做幌子的中共黨徒們槍殺了，無事地槍殺一個毫無政治作用毫無抵抗能力的老婦人，這是　　沉痛的慘案和血債。　　年了，今夜又是狂風暴雨，我熄燈面窗靜坐，彷彿在萬馬奔騰的雨聲裏，聽到母親臨刑前最祕求生的呼號，我隱約地嗅到濃厚的血腥氣呵！我好似見到莽莽的荒原上，母親的血由創口汨汨的向外流……時間只加深了我慘痛的記憶，激起我仇恨，憤怒和永無窮的哀思！　　我與母親闊別八年了，在這漫長而悠久的歲月中，母親以殉道者的精神，守候着殘破的鄕土和殘破的家，在中共種種壓榨凌辱無所不用其極的管制下度着淸苦亦貧的”子，過着受屈辱與受損害牛馬一般的生活，眼看着兒輩們像一隻隻學飛的乳燕，一隻離巢飛去了，窮病潦倒的晚境，正如故居里門外的古柏樹，被中共「假淸野」時燒房舍的不愼，炙死了，很久很久只剩枯枝元立着，寂寞地打發她暗淡的時光；眼看着五弟夭折，眼看着我們大姊妹，一個個像斷了綫的風箏，找不到半點消息，眼看着生活一天比一天窘迫，吃黑麥，地菌，樹皮時還得趕製「勞軍鞋」，……這樣艱苦的磨折，這樣鐵的拷打，母親爲什麽能甘之如飴，能堅持得下，還不是一個偉大的信念，一個光明的遠景在鼓舞她老人家生活的勇氣嗎？那就是：「總會有那麼一天，鬼子打敗了，老伴和兒輩們相率歸來，重度戰前骨肉團聚的生活！」　　誠然，勝利是降臨了，但幸福並不屬於我們的，我們的母親活生生的被人被土匪被人間最殘酷的劊子手槍殺了，當我們能進入故居時，除了從頽垣殘壁中去追摹當年母親生活的大槪外，母親是含着一棺木的眼淚和寃苦撒手離開人間了，我們除了長跪在荒草藝萋的墓前痛哭，我們能以什麽來報答養育我們的母親，更能怎樣來爲母親和與母親同樣慘遇的人們復仇呵！　　在一間茅草屋裏，見着奄奄一息彌留在病榻上的外祖母，我們噙住滾滾翻動的淚水，外祖母勉力睜開毫無生氣的眼，外祖母肩頭抽動了，老淚縱横，乾枯的嘴嚅嚅的低語着：「孩子：你們來得太遲了，你們永遠再見不着媽……」　　此後經過多方探訊，知道母親當敵人投降後就被監視得更嚴，好像生恐她進入自由區域裏，所以在殉難前兩個月還曾和一位老年的親戚沉痛的談：「棠兒回來了，恐怕母子們今生不能再見！」可見母親在當時就自知不免一死，但爲什麽不立即離開這虎穴呢？又究竟爲什麼會死呢？她並沒想到，在她心裏還不是因爲自己多病對生活的煎熬沒有勇氣再承受下去，尤其唯恐共區一時收復不易，再拖幾年拖也拖死了，又怎能會想到能像一隻純善的老羊聽人殺戮，否則我想母親一定委設法逃呵！　　天下間孰能無母？中共黨徒們如稍存人性，決不該作如此毒辣如此愚笨的屠殺，易地處之，倘是毛澤東及其黨徒們的母親無辜地被人殺害，身受失母的痛苦，則又將作何觀感？這是不共戴天之仇呵，爲什麼要這樣縱令黨徒們如此窮凶極惡？　　幾經壓抑了，站在報人的立塲上，最初爲了顧惜整個國家的和平，我不願將這個鐵的事實，將這個沉痛的慘案公諾於國人之前，被認爲危言聳聽，我曾噙住淚，帶着悲哀，忍着憤怒往還採訪於參與和談的各黨派之間，唯一希望是：等到和平實現了，化干戈爲玉帛，在堂堂的法律下再追究兇手，可是事實却令我們失望呵！我旣不能在統一和平的局面下爲母親請求緝兇，那麼我唯有向世人，向眞愛好民主自由，維護國家民族的同胞請援，我相信我只是千百萬嘗受這樣不幸遭遇的一個，我控訴中共罪行呵！　　國人們，我們要淸査血債呵！我們要防止這慘絕人寰的事跡漫無限制地演出在祖國土地上！我們要求法律爲我緝兇，要求政府保障我們最基本的生命，我們擁護戡亂總動員令，我們要向全世界控訴，中共不僅是一個武裝叛亂的匪黨，而且是摧殘人性的屠戶！（七月改作於六合旅次）　　關於歌德的一篇應該是二十八日見報的，「哭母親」則預定三十日刊登，臨時均因篇幅限制，一併於今日登載，特此聲明。（編者）蘇武牧羊（木刻）　白勺劉易士的新作  趙景深　　誰也想不到，老杜克劉易士（Doc　Lewis）的兒子哈萊劉易士（Harry　Lewis）小名呌做陶陶（Doodle），竟會有今日的成就。他在明尼蘇達的索克中心做旅館的夜班書記。後來又在本地的「週報」，「新港報差」（New　Haven　Journal-Courier）和舊金山的「官報」（Bulletn）任職，官報的經理還曾停過他的職，說他是無能的訪員。他容貌醜陋，滿臉雀斑，又是紅頭髮，却能訪出美麗的紗。在雅禮大學，他寫詩，又主編「點火」（Lit，後來就替辛克萊通火爐。他住在紐約，做過社會工作，又曾巷兩個女作家做過書記，賣過小說和書報。從一九一四到一九一九，他寫過五本人家忘記了的小說。一九二〇年他的「大街」出版，方纔獲得聲譽。兩年以後的「白璽特」，使他的聲譽增加。以後又出版「愛爾默爾，幹特雷」，「愛羅史密司」（此作他拒受普利支獎金），「多池威士」，「安，維克爾士」（Ann　Nickers）以及「這事不能在此地發生」（It　Cant't　Happen　Here）。他是第一個諾貝爾文學獎金的獲得者。他離婚過兩次，第一位是海吉爾（Grace　Hegger），第二位是湯樸生（Dorothy　Thompson）。他的兩個兒子，威爾斯死於戰役；米契爾（Mickael）是個高個子，還在學校裏讀書。無論工作或遊戲，他的力量都是原子的。他還寫過一本戲劇「我們的城」（Our　Town），不久也許還要寫一個劇本。　　最近劉易士（Sinclair　Lewis）又寫了一本「王家的金士不落」（Kingblood　Royal），這是他的第二十本小說。不要以爲這又是一本黑奴問題的小說，其實這不僅僅是黑奴問題，而是美國問題的小說。大意敍金士不落是一個紅頭髮的美　的高個子，在明尼蘇達共和國第二國家銀行做會計助理。倘若作者讓他做到銀行經理，得到成功，沒有什麽不愉快的事情發生，就這樣平靜也死去，也就沒有什麽驚人之處了。偏偏金士不落發現他的皮膚裏有不可見的化學的黑人遺痕。他尋找家族樹，發現他的母家是黑人的後代。他自己是這黑人的第三十二代。　　發現以後，金士不落有三條路可走：第一，他可以把他所知道的隱瞞起來。第二，他還是自稱白種人，暗地裏爲黑人工作。第三，他宣布給大衆他自己是黑人的子孫。後來他就觀察黑人，覺得一般人認爲黑人怎樣好或怎樣壞，都是偏頗之論。黑中也有好人，也有壞人；也有齷齪的，也有乾淨的；也有醜陋的，也有美麗的，和美國人一樣。他們不希望人家喜愛他，讚美他，也不希望人家怕他，折磨他黑人只希望把他們當作普通的人，他們願意做白璧特，愛爾默爾幹特雷，愛羅史密司，安維克爾士或金士不落，他們不願把他們看得太高或太低。他們沒有特殊的德行，也沒有特殊的罪惡。　　美國人也朱始不知道，但只知道在心裏。美　　人應該把黑人看成沒有種族的分別，和自己一樣，所以我說這是美國的問題。一寸山河一寸血  葉勁風　883　　耀羣倒沒什麽，一見面當然服着老套，彼此間好問安，這位小老虎可受了罪了　　孩子……你這兒來！　奶奶雖說一個下半夜沒歇下，精神可一點沒打折扣，一眼瞧見了兒子，仍舊那麼……還是那　好好兒的，頭上脚下，點沒多。一點也沒少什麽，這才放了心，兜心底都是快樂，自不）用說，可是除了滿臉滿眉尖全是笑意外，還掛舊兩行熱淚：「孩子……那怕你當了小隊長不是？大小全是個官兒哪……就憑你那點小能耐可不成，不是？……來！……雖說你千里迢迢，趕這們遠路回來，累了不是？可咱們不能不　禮節……先給你紀姨行個官　，吿一聲『失陪陪」，再跟你大伯叩個頭……跟你這些位伯伯，大叔，小叔，姥姥，嬸嬸，也都得叩頭……再跟你媽上廳去，爺爺一輩的都等在那兒哪，都得，……回頭……　屋子裏還有你祖父的靈位……還有你爹的第位！……」統計下來，約莫一百四五調「叩頭」。　　　羣只打算在寨子裏躭擱一天，所以在歡迎接風等等塲而結束之後，立即請了龍五爺和幾位頭腦職事，到議事堂說話。這是牠這一趟辛苦的唯一目標。　　大姑娘，您不能跟咱們客氣，」龍五爺一聽　羣開口，立刻接渦了話；「您怎麼說，怎麼好；哪怕喒全　子全挪到關裹去都成……！　　「話是這麽說，五　；」　　準備發表她的打算了：「問題不能那麽簡單，要能那麽簡單，我又何必跑道一趟？只給您來一封信不就行了？……這兒是老寨，這點根基都是血和汗　來……况且關外關裹，樣吃重。我的意思，看您能抽調二三十位夥計不能；可不能　顧我這一面；這也不是客氣的事……人也得挑選，是要緊還得徵求他們各位的同意，各人不是還有各人的家庭問題嗎？……」　　談話的結果，　羣和龍五爺規定了一個台理性的辦法；先徵求一正一副兩位隊長，給他們一個挑選人員的標準，由他們去徵集四位小隊長，再由每小除除長，各人徵築四五名隊員，合計起來，全隊也快三十人左右了。這個數目聽來很小，然而老寨每次游擊的隊子，却從未超過這個數目，可見他們的質地，都是一以抵百的上選。　　這徵求的辦法剛一議決，就見職事座上有人站了起來，扯起大喇叭似的嗓子，先乾咳了一聲，淸了淸聲帶上的　痰：　　「這件差事，乾脆就交給喒和喒武二哥得啦……」老龍邊說邊拉了一個勇武鏡頭的架子，對全體議事人掃射式的一拱手；這點身段，照京戲的術語說，弄得十分「邊式」，頗像「佟家霧（塢）」裏馬玉龍起「呌頭」的味兒，只少了「叭啦欽鏘，扎，扎，扎……」的鑼鼓點子。　　老龍說了這一句，把一雙眼睛儘量睜得大大地，顯出十分的英雄氣槪，從龍五爺和耀羣，等等，一位一位挨次瞧了一眼；要看看大家對於他這個請求的反應；瞧到末了一位，重又把瞧光回射到龍五爺和耀羣身上；又把雙字捧在一起，打了十　措。</p>

<h3>Various Foreign Currency Public Bonds and Savings Certificates to be Redeemed at Foreign Exchange Market Prices; U.S. Dollar Short-Term Treasury Bills to Continue to be Sold at Market Prices; Seventh Provisional Meeting of the Executive Yuan Approves</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] The Executive Yuan held its seventh provisional meeting at 9:00 AM on the 30th, with over twenty members attending, chaired by Zhang Qun. Two major items were approved: (1) The 1948 Administrative Policy Outline was resolved to be submitted for review. (2) The Ministry of Finance proposed that, following the government's announcement of revised foreign exchange control measures, separate review procedures should be established for all U.S. dollar short-term treasury bills issued by the government in 1947, as well as previously issued various foreign currency public bonds, to maintain creditor confidence. The resolutions were: 1. U.S. dollar short-term treasury bills for 1947 will continue to be sold at the listed market price of designated banks, effective immediately. 2. The principal and interest of U.S. dollar short-term treasury bills for 1947 will be calculated according to the listed market price of designated banks at maturity. 3. The 1938 British pound and U.S. dollar public bonds, the 1940 British pound and U.S. dollar construction bonds, the 1942 Allied Victory U.S. dollar public bonds, and the 1942 U.S. dollar savings certificates will all be converted to national currency based on the listed market price of designated banks.</p>
<p>The 1948 Administrative Policy Outline is Referred to a Special Task Force for Review</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] The government's 1948 Administrative Policy Outline was submitted for discussion at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 30th. Due to the broad scope of the content and time constraints, a thorough discussion was not possible. It was decided that Wang Yunwu would convene a separate task force meeting for special review. It is reported that the outline contains a total of thirty-six articles, divided into two main sections: one for implementing constitutional government and the other for strengthening the suppression of rebellion, drafted by the Central Design Bureau.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Following the Executive Yuan's decision on the morning of the 30th to continue issuing U.S. dollar treasury bills, Finance Minister Yu told reporters: Before the Central Bank's exchange rate (i.e., the official rate) is changed, the government could have paid in national currency converted at the bank's U.S. dollar rate on the payment date. However, to implement the spirit of issuing these treasury bills and demonstrate credibility, the Executive Yuan, after detailed discussion this morning, decided on the following three measures: (1) U.S. dollar treasury bills will be sold at the listed market price of designated banks. (2) The principal and interest of these treasury bills at maturity will be redeemed at the listed market price of designated banks. (3) The British pound and U.S. dollar public bonds of 1938, the British pound and U.S. dollar construction bonds of 1940, the Allied Victory U.S. dollar public bonds of 1942, and the U.S. dollar savings certificates will all be redeemed for principal and interest at the listed market price of designated banks. While this decision will inevitably increase the burden on the national treasury, the government is willing to implement it for the sake of creditor confidence. It hopes that the people of the nation will understand this intention and enthusiastically subscribe to complete the mission of the people during the suppression of the rebellion and national recovery.</p>
<h3>New Construction Program of the Kuomintang; Divided into Three Major Sections, Resolved to be Submitted for Discussion at the Fourth Plenary Session</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] As the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang is about to open, the Standing Committee, after studying and formulating the "Party's New Construction Program," has decided to submit it for discussion at the plenary session. It is learned that the content of the program is divided into three major sections: one is a review of the current situation, the second is the current organizational program, and the third is the post-recovery revolutionary political program. The main points of its content are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The review of the Party's current situation states that it has been twenty-three years since the reorganization in 1924 and nineteen years since the general registration in 1928, making it necessary to add new vitality. The shortcomings of past party affairs are reviewed in five points: 1. Insufficient revolutionary enthusiasm, allowing bureaucrats and politicians to infiltrate; 2. The Party only focuses on form, and the policy of cultivating cadres is insufficient; 3. Party discipline is lax; 4. The style leans towards pragmatism and is disconnected from actual politics; 5. The awareness of small organizations within the Party is strong. To complete the revolution in the future, the Party must be revitalized.</p>
<p>(2) The current organizational program of the Party includes four items regarding party members: 1. Standards for party members; 2. Delineation of the rights and obligations of party members; 3. Registration of party members' assets - A. Special attention should be paid to cadres and party members in government (party members serving in public enterprises and financial institutions). Those who make false reports should be punished; 4. Party members should take a new oath. B. Regarding organization and operation, it includes eleven points, the main ones being: A. The Seventh National Congress will be held on May 5, 1948; B. Strengthen management of party members in government; C. The President will regularly chair the Standing Committee; D. Investigate comrades with abilities among domestic cadres to go to the front lines; E. Establish the Party's cadre policy, etc. C. Regarding discipline: 1. Expel members of other parties and expel them from the Party; 2. Strengthen the powers of supervision; 3. Those expelled from the Party will not be employed within the Party apparatus as a sanction.</p>
<p>The post-recovery revolutionary political program is divided into six items: 1. Suppress the communist bandits, clearly stipulating the suppression of communist bandits while also suppressing local bandits and scattered bandits everywhere, and improve the treatment of officers and soldiers and make military expenditures public; 2. Consolidate national sovereignty, raise the status of the nation and the people, and negotiate with the Soviet Union to recover sovereign rights in the Northeast; 3. Eliminate corruption, pay attention to increasing the power of supervisory officials and the rights of provincial and county assemblies to question local leaders and approve budgets, and effectively improve the treatment of public employees and teachers; 4. Implement constitutional government, establish provincial and county budget and financial systems, and immediately implement direct elections of provincial and county magistrates; 5. Equalize land rights, change the current farming system with cooperative farms, complete land registration, and implement the collection of land value tax and land appreciation tax; 6. Regulate capital, implement planned economy, strictly restrict speculation and the development of bureaucratic capital, implement a unified property tax and income tax system, and improve the lives of the working masses based on social policies.</p>
<h3>Provisional Political Meeting Discusses Wei Ambassador's Statement in General Terms</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] In his statement upon leaving China, Ambassador Wei criticized our government for corruption and incompetence. To review local politics and Ambassador Wei's statement, the Executive Yuan convened a provisional political meeting on the 30th. However, due to the large number of accumulated cases in the Executive Yuan requiring discussion, the discussion was only general and did not reach a conclusion. Zhang Qun delivered a speech before the discussion, and Zhang Lisheng and others also discussed the actual situation of local politics.</p>
<h3>Wei Ambassador Busy in Korea; Continues to Receive Representatives from Various Parties</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 30th] Since arriving here, U.S. Special Envoy Wedemeyer has been busy receiving people from all walks of life. This morning (30th) at 9:00 AM, he received Chief Civil Administrator Ahn Jae-hong, who presented him with a report from the interim government, including issues such as politics, economy, culture, education, civil engineering, agriculture, and labor. This afternoon, Special Envoy Wei continued to meet with representatives of individuals and groups. As of the time of dispatch, those he had met included representatives from the Korean Independence Party, the Independence Promotion Association, the Women's Nationalist Party, the Laboring People's Party, and Syngman Rhee, among others. The Korean Interim Legislative Assembly is currently in recess and will reconvene on September 1. At that time, Special Envoy Wei plans to visit the assembly in person to meet with the members.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 29th] Kim Yo-in (transliteration), chairman of the Korean Affairs Research Association here, stated on the 29th that he hopes Representative Wedemeyer can listen to the voices of the silent masses of Korea and that the middle class and liberals of Korea can express their hopes and opinions without reservation. He stated that the opinions of the advisors to the military government in Korea do not represent the people because most of them were recommended by reactionary elements who were trusted by the U.S. authorities in Korea at the time. He also specifically pointed out that some important officials in the police department are former high-ranking Korean traitors from the Japanese regime era.</p>

<h3>Chen Cheng Leaves Nanjing for Shenyang Today; Before Leaving, He Expresses His Opinions on Governing the Northeast and Encourages His Subordinates to Complete the Goal of Building the Army</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] Chen Cheng, also Director of the Northeast Headquarters, is scheduled to leave Nanjing for Shenyang on the morning of the 31st. At 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 30th, people from the Northeast in Nanjing held a farewell tea party, attended by Liu Zhe, Ma Liang, Zhang Qianhua, and over a hundred others. Chen Cheng delivered a speech on the spot. He first praised the abundant resources of the Northeast, believing that without the Northeast, it is equivalent to having no North China, and without North China, it is equivalent to having no China. He then elaborated on his opinions on governance in the Northeast, roughly as follows: (1) In terms of politics, strive to consider the interests of the people and not separate from the people. A government that separates from the people is no longer a government, so in the future, we should strive to cooperate with the people. (2) Simplify the organization. He believes that the administrative organization in the Northeast is overly complex and has too many layers. In addition to the nine provinces and three cities in Jinan, there are also special commissioners from various ministries of the Executive Yuan, making the organization very large, which needs to be simplified. (3) Increase work efficiency, especially for the provincial governments of the provinces that have not yet been recovered, which are currently located in Shenyang, which is not conducive to the progress of work. Therefore, he advocates that the provincial governments should be located within their respective provinces. (4) In terms of economy, it is planned to transport soybeans and coal, special products of the Northeast, to exchange for machinery, cotton cloth, and flour from Guan Nei (inside the customs), so as to stabilize the economy of the Northeast. Chen Cheng concluded by saying that the goal is to eliminate the communist bandits, recover the lost territories, clean up officialdom, simplify the organization, punish corruption, and maintain military discipline. Subsequently, Yu Bin delivered a reply on behalf of the attendees, expressing his welcome and emphasizing that the people of the Northeast will definitely cooperate with Chen Cheng's command to achieve military-civilian cooperation and fulfill Chen Cheng's mission. The gathering dispersed at 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] According to the Military News Agency, Chen Cheng stated at the farewell gathering of people from the Northeast on the 30th: We are willing to make great sacrifices. No matter how difficult it is, the Northeast must be recovered from the hands of the rebels and fulfill the aspirations during the war of resistance. Our responsibility will not be completed until this goal is achieved. It is hoped that all people from the Northeast will work together to move towards this goal. Everything that the Northeast faces today is more serious than the situation under the past Japanese occupation. In the future, the Northeast will still focus on military affairs, but we will also do our best in terms of politics, economy, winning people's hearts, and seeking the happiness of the people. Currently, there are too many parallel organizations in the Northeast. Three plans have been drawn up: (1) The Political and Economic Committees will be abolished and reorganized to form a Political Affairs Bureau. (2) Both the Political and Economic Committees will be abolished without establishing other organizations. (3) The two committees will still be under the jurisdiction of the Northeast Headquarters. The provincial and municipal governments and party and youth organizations of the unreclaimed areas of the Northeast are now operating in Shenyang. There are also two suggestions for this situation: First, all local agencies should follow the army to operate in areas close to the provinces. Second, if they remain in Shenyang, they should all be merged and actively operate. The above suggestions will be submitted to the highest authorities for approval. Regarding the economy, Chen Cheng said: During this trip to the Northeast, it was found that the most urgent needs of the Northeast are food, cloth, and machinery, especially machinery. It is hoped that the central government can find ways to restore and rebuild the Northeast's industry, which will definitely increase production and destroy the communist bandits. Other aspects, such as improving people's lives and military-civilian cooperation, will also be fully committed to.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] According to the Military News Agency, the National Government has ordered Chief of Staff Chen Cheng to also serve as Director of the Northeast Headquarters. Chairman Chiang summoned Chief Chen that evening, giving instructions on important military matters in the Northeast. As Chief Chen was about to depart, he summoned all officers above the rank of major from the various departments and bureaus of the Ministry of National Defense and the joint logistics headquarters of the army, navy, and air force at the auditorium of the ministry at 9:00 AM on the 30th, with over 1,430 officers attending. Chief Chen, dressed in military uniform, delivered a speech at the meeting, first reviewing the general business results of the Ministry of National Defense since its establishment fifteen months ago. He then earnestly encouraged his subordinates to continue their efforts to complete the military personnel system in order to build a modern national army. He later said: In the future, we should continue to emphasize frugality and rectify military discipline in order to achieve the goal of building the army and building the nation, so as to consolidate national defense and establish a strong new China. The meeting adjourned at about 9:00 AM.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] When Chen Cheng summoned officers of the Ministry of National Defense for instructions on the morning of the 30th, he said: The main tasks of the Ministry of National Defense in the past fifteen months were two: one was to merge organizations. The original organization of the Ministry of National Defense had more than 10,000 units, which have gradually been reduced to more than 5,000 units. The second was to reorganize the army. This work has already progressed to a considerable extent and will continue in the future. Chen Cheng hopes to complete the national defense system within three years, and this matter should be pursued from three aspects: (1) Establish a personnel system. The retirement and dismissal of officers should be handled seriously. Chen pointed out the importance of metabolism. The Xiang Army and Huai Army and Yuan Shikai's Xiaozhan training troops were once extremely prosperous, but soon declined. Since the establishment of the National Revolutionary Army, it has been twenty years, and some have criticized it for also declining. If we can attach importance to the retirement and dismissal of officers, it will create a metabolic effect. (2) Establish a supply system. It is inappropriate for officers to concurrently manage supply. A supply system should be established. (3) Establish an education system. In the future, we should focus on the country. During his speech today, Chen Cheng expressed that corruption of military discipline should be thoroughly rectified, and he hoped to practice frugality in all aspects. Military officers have little income, so banquets should be kept frugal. Even military equipment should be carefully guarded. Finally, Chen Cheng also mentioned Wedemeyer's farewell remarks, hoping that everyone can reflect on themselves.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 30th] The Jilin Provincial Provisional Assembly sent a congratulatory telegram to Chen Cheng for his concurrent appointment as Director of the Northeast Headquarters, and looked forward to "seeing a new administration clean up officialdom, eliminate bandits, and recover the entire Northeast."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 30th] The Northeast Headquarters has completed its administrative affairs and is preparing to hand over. Secretary-General Hu Jiafeng, Secretary-General of the Political Committee Wen Jincheng, and Director of the Director's Office Xu Pengfei have all resigned.</p>
<h3>The Number of Seats for Occupational Group Elections; To be Decided After the Reopening of the Legislative Yuan; Restrictions on Women's Groups to be Revised</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] Minister Gu Zhengchao met with reporters on the 30th to discuss the issue of occupational group elections, saying that the issue of the number of representatives of occupational groups needs to be resolved after the Legislative Yuan reopens. However, among various occupational representatives, the chambers of commerce are the most common and the most sound, but the number of representatives of commercial groups in the National Assembly is only thirteen, and in the Legislative Yuan only five, which seems to be too few. The Ministry of Social Affairs will consult with the Legislative Yuan on this matter based on the instructions of the National Government and the requests of various parties, and it is believed that an appropriate solution can be reached soon. Also, regarding the National Assembly's women's groups, the requirement that national women's groups "must have more than five branches in various provinces and cities, and their membership lists must be registered with the Ministry" is not in accordance with the People's Group Organization Law, since women's groups are ordinary groups and do not necessarily need to have grassroots organizations like occupational groups. The regulations stipulated by the Legislative Yuan are inconsistent with the People's Group Organization Law promulgated by the National Government. The Ministry will consult with the Legislative Yuan on this matter and hopes to obtain an appropriate solution. Regarding the Journalists Law, the Ministry will consult with the internal committee, and in the future, broadcast journalists may be included in the qualifications for journalists.</p>
<h3>Typhoon Landed in Fuzhou; Predicted to Reach Nanjing This Morning</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 30th] The U.S. Army's 43rd Weather Squadron reported that at 3:00 AM Tokyo time on the 30th, Typhoon "Inez" had reached the Fuzhou area of China. The wind direction has shifted slightly to the northwest, with a speed of sixteen miles per hour, and it may reach a point one hundred miles south of Nanjing at 3:00 AM on Sunday morning.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Fuzhou, 30th] A Pacific typhoon invaded the Fujian coast from the Taiwan Strait and landed in the Fuzhou and Xiamen areas on the evening of the 28th, with strong winds reaching level eleven. Yesterday, Fuzhou city was shrouded in roaring winds and heavy rain, uprooting trees and collapsing houses, and stores were closed, creating a desolate scene in the city. The sea was turbulent, and all ships on various routes were temporarily suspended. Yesterday, telecommunications were interrupted, and reporters were blocked from sending dispatches. Today, the wind gradually weakened, and the timely rain gladdened the farmers, with hopes for the autumn harvest.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 30th] The typhoon passed through Hangzhou and Jiaxing yesterday and today. The Qiantang River surged at noon, and the seawall at Sibao in Hangzhou was also in danger. The original three or four miles of sandbanks in that area have collapsed completely. The tide has reached the highway, and because there is no stone embankment protection in that area, the situation is quite critical. The embankment engineering bureau is currently taking strict precautions.</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan Talks; Communist Bandits in the Northeast Brew Sixth Offensive</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 30th] Ma Zhanshan flew from Shenyang to Peiping on the 27th to seek medical treatment and plans to return to Shenyang after a short rest. Ma Zhanshan met with reporters on the 30th, saying that communist bandits in the Northeast are indeed brewing a sixth offensive in many places. However, the Northeast has added the armies of Wang Tiehan and Zhou Ce, and the vacancies in the original armies have also been filled, greatly increasing their strength. With Chief Chen taking personal command in the future, the situation in the Northeast is expected to stabilize day by day. Regarding the Songbei Pacification, Ma Zhanshan said: The Songbei Pacification Headquarters was established two months ago by order of the Ministry of National Defense, but it has not yet started work. The organizational structure has six departments, plus eight departments including the press department. The heads of the departments are generally determined. The chief of staff, Fan Yushu, is the former deputy chief of staff of the Security Commander's Office. In the future, the headquarters will be located in Changchun. The affiliated troops are still awaiting allocation from above. Ma Zhanshan finally said that the underground army in Songbei is mostly fighting in the southern Manchuria area due to the shortage of weapons and ammunition, and its strength needs to be strengthened urgently.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 30th] There is fighting in the northern part of Wula Street, with the central part of the bandits, Zhou Bao, harassing Xiaosanjia from Daguchaizi. Fierce fighting is currently underway. In addition, the bandits in Pinggang, west of Xi'an, have been making probing attacks westward in small groups for several days.</p>
<h3>Third Batch of Distributed Ships Received in Qingdao Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 30th] Eight ships in the third batch of Japanese distributed ships were received at a ceremony held in Qingdao City at 8:00 AM on the 30th.</p>
<h3>U.S. State Department Announces Diplomatic Personnel Stationed in China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 29th] The U.S. State Department announced the names of newly appointed diplomatic personnel. Klein and Lancaster will be assigned to Nanjing to serve in China, and Scott will be sent to work on consular affairs in North America.</p>
<h3>The United States Should Support China for Its Own Interests; Howard Newspaper Group Calls for Aid to China</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 30th] An editorial in the Howard newspaper group stated that the United States must do something for China, otherwise it can only withdraw from Asia. The Chinese Nationalist government has many shortcomings, but at a time when the world is divided into two opposing camps, the US and the Soviet Union, from the American point of view, there is one important point that is correct: Chairman Chiang is within the American camp. Air Force strategists believe that it is foolish not to support a friendly Chinese government. If the power of the CCP spreads to the Yellow River, the already reduced area cannot defend itself, and the United States will also suffer. Conversely, if a friendly China continues to hold the line, the United States can still use air bases to allow B-29s to reach points in Siberia at any time, and the Soviet Union will not dare to risk war.</p>
<h3>The Aspirations of Guangdong - Random Notes from a Southern Trip, Part Four…</h3>
<p>— Bu Shaofu</p>
<p>There is a far-sighted observation circulating here:</p>
<p>If World War III breaks out, if the United States and the Soviet Union are the main belligerents, the battleground will be in Korea, our Northeast, or even Northwest. At that time, our rear area for resistance will not be Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou in the Southwest, but rather Guangdong and Guangxi in South China, and Guangzhou may become the wartime capital.</p>
<p>This conclusion has a strong seductive and stimulating power.</p>
<p>Bearing the responsibility of China's rear area in World War III is a difficult task, but this vision encourages the Guangdong authorities to work hard on construction. I dare not say that the "Guangdong Province Five-Year Construction Plan" was caused by this factor, but I know that our war of resistance has already been won, and construction still needs to be completed. This is our national policy, but this message has a considerable influence.</p>
<p>During my stay in Guangzhou, I encountered power outages and lights as dim as beans more than once. The places where this happened included grand restaurants in the busiest urban areas and the residences of certain bureau chiefs. I once asked several local people about this, and their answers were no different from Mr. Luo Zhuoying's – a shortage of coal. According to Mr. Yao, Guangdong now relies on coal from Hunan; and the Yuehan Railway (Guangdong-Hankou Railway) occupies a large portion of the consumption. There are not enough train cars, and when transportation problems occur, the source of coal becomes even more difficult. This issue aroused my interest. Economic construction cannot be separated from power, and among power sources, coal is the most important raw material. How much coal reserves does Guangdong have?</p>
<p>The "Guangdong Province Five-Year Construction Plan" (which the provincial government completed after meticulous research by over a hundred experts and scholars over eight months) has the following explanation in the coal mine section of the mining category:</p>
<p>'...The province produces very little coal, almost incomparable to other countries in the world (annual output of 200,000 tons)... According to the mining summary of the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), the province's coal reserves rank 22nd in the country, with a total of 421,000,000 tons. Among them, bituminous coal accounts for about 90 percent, and anthracite coal accounts for about 10 percent. Anthracite coal was previously only used for burning lime and for household cooking, but with a little mixing, it can be used for industrial purposes. Although bituminous coal accounts for the majority of the reserves, most of it is still semi-anthracite coal, and the amount of bituminous coal that can be used for coking and metallurgy is still small.'</p>
<p>How much of the 400 million tons of reserves can be used for "industrial purposes"? Experts and scholars have not yet given a definite answer. This makes people quite apprehensive about the independence of Guangdong's industrial construction in the future. Whether it is dependent or independent, Guangdong's underground resources are still buried, and the living standards of people above ground are not high enough. There are too many things that need to be done. In a nutshell, Guangdong needs development and construction. According to the provincial government's first five-year plan (there are a total of four five-year plans), if it is completed as scheduled in the 40th year of the Republic of China (1951), even if it encounters a disaster like this year's, it will not be so urgent as to appeal to other provinces for relief.</p>
<p>The construction plan, so far, has not been carried out in a decisive and concrete way. The atmosphere is naturally very strong, especially the activities of foreign capital and overseas Chinese capital. In Hong Kong and Haikou, I have heard similar intentions. Foreign capital and overseas Chinese capital have taken a fancy to Guangdong, which is undoubtedly very insightful. However, they still have a concern, and that is the issue of security. This is for the sake of capital safety. In addition, they need the government to provide a kind of guarantee for operations, which is for the sake of the safety of profits. Before these two prerequisites are met, foreign capital and overseas Chinese capital may always hesitate and be reluctant to move forward.</p>
<p>In the Dongguan Guest House where I was staying, there once lived a distinguished guest of the provincial government – Major Hanley of the United States. He represented some American investors to negotiate with the Guangdong Provincial Government on cooperative construction projects. This negotiation started as early as last summer, and now, a preliminary draft has already been signed – the provincial government has requested instructions from various central ministries and commissions and received their consent. The remaining issue is the formal establishment of Hanley Company in the United States, fundraising, and the transportation of machinery to China.</p>
<p>Xie Wenlong, the Director of the Construction Department, was one of the main representatives participating in this negotiation. Until I left Guangzhou, I did not find an opportunity to talk to him about the specifics of Hanley Company. However, I know that Luo Zhuoying spent a lot of effort to present this matter to the central government and get it approved. The same is true for Guangdong Province itself. Because whether it is the central government or the local government, there is always a contradictory mentality towards foreign capital – on the one hand, it is welcomed, and on the other hand, it is feared. Under this contradictory mentality, some plans and opportunities are strangled or shelved. I do not know the details of the preliminary draft agreement signed between Hanley Company and the Guangdong Provincial Government, but I know that two principles have been agreed upon by both parties: first, within a certain number of years (about ten years), Guangdong Province can gradually recover the American shares of various factories, and the total amount of American shares must not exceed 50% of the total capital; second, all land, factory buildings, and construction of various factories are to be undertaken by Guangdong Province, and all staff members, except for a few engineers and technicians, are also to be appointed by Guangdong Province. Major Hanley took the draft agreement back to the United States, leaving only a few assistants in Hong Kong and Guangzhou.</p>
<p>Hanley himself is not a capitalist, but he has connections with the Export-Import Bank of the United States and has considerable appeal in the United States. Now that he has obtained the protection of the Guangdong Provincial Government for cooperation, there will certainly be no difficulties in proceeding. In fact, besides Hanley, many British and American people are willing to invest in Guangdong. According to Mr. Liu Zuoren, the president of the Guangdong Provincial Bank, there are four similar contacts with him privately, one of whom is British. These people are either very wealthy themselves or have made a lot of war profits in this war. In order to avoid the heavy property taxes of their own governments, they are very eager to transfer their assets to China. If they can make a profit from this, wouldn't it be even better? Therefore, they are very eager, but their governments have repeatedly stopped them, saying: Take your time and see what the situation in China is before making a decision!</p>
<p>The return of overseas Chinese to invest is not only a subjective inevitability. When a Chinese person has money, he naturally has to return to his motherland and use it on the land of his motherland; but also an objective inevitable trend. In this war and after the war, the overseas Chinese deeply felt the lack of security for their property overseas. Especially after the war, the surging national self-determination movements everywhere, the situation of the overseas Chinese is like a sandwich, suffering from two sides of pressure, which is extremely painful. If the motherland gives guarantees and conveniences for investment, they will definitely take back all their possessions at all costs. However, for several years, we have been shouting to welcome overseas Chinese to return to invest. Can we cite a few successful undertakings that are the product of this movement? During my trip this time, in Hainan Island, I also heard an unpleasant incident about overseas Chinese investment. An overseas Chinese development company (?) purchased several acres of land in Wenchang before the war, preparing to engage in farm management. These lands have formal title deeds and certificates from the Guangdong Provincial Department of Finance and the Ministry of Finance. Later, due to the war, followed by the fall of the area, it had to be temporarily suspended. After the victory, when they returned to Hainan Island, several people from Wenchang came out to stop them, saying that there was a problem with their property rights. The county government's mediation was unsuccessful, the local court ruled against him, and the high court irresponsibly sent it back for retrial, wasting time and effort. Several persons in charge of this company were almost driven mad.</p>
<p>Guangdong has a vision. In addition to planning, everyone knows that the use of foreign capital and overseas Chinese capital are two major forces that cannot be ignored. Foreign capital and overseas Chinese capital are also willing to come. The problem is whether we can give guarantees and conveniences.</p>
<h3>TASS Distorts Treaty on Dalian Port Opening</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] After our official statement that "Dalian Port cannot be opened until our government has officially taken over Dalian," according to a report from the United Press on the 28th, TASS issued a statement saying: "According to Article 4 of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, before the establishment of a peace treaty with Japan, Dalian should be under the jurisdiction of the administrative organ of the Lushun Naval Base area, and Soviet ships still have the right to enter Dalian," etc. The Central News Agency notes: Article 4 of the Sino-Soviet "Agreement on Dalian" stipulates that "Dalian shall only be under the control of the Lushun Military Region during the war against Japan," and there is no provision for "before the establishment of a peace treaty with Japan." The Chinese government believes that what TASS said is purely a distortion of the treaty.</p>
<h3>Zhang Junmai Will Return to Shanghai Immediately; No Decision Yet on Candidates to Fill Vacancies for Political Committee Members of the Democratic Socialist Party in the Government</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] According to Yang Yuzi, a standing committee member of the Democratic Socialist Party, told reporters: "Zhang Junmai will take a flight back to Shanghai within a day or two and does not intend to go to Nanjing first. The candidates to fill the vacancies for the Democratic Socialist Party's government committee's political committee members have not been considered yet and will be decided after Mr. Zhang returns to Shanghai. All the outside rumors are completely inaccurate."</p>

<h3>Henan and Shandong Recover Huangchuan and Zhucheng; Remnants of Liu Bocheng's Troops Flee into Dabie Mountains</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 30th] The National Army's pursuing and suppressing troops in southern Henan crossed the Huai River from Huajiadian, Linhedian, Dalindian, and Dougou on the 29th, respectively, advancing towards Huangchuan and Luoshan. Huangchuan was recovered on the afternoon of the 30th (Huangchuan was captured by bandits on the night of the 28th). The remnants of the Liu bandits' 2nd and 6th Columns fled south in a panic.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Let Us Rely on Our Own Efforts!</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday, the State Council meeting, personally presided over by Chairman Chiang, made important new decisions regarding the current domestic and foreign policy. Yesterday's Political Affairs Conference continued to conduct a more detailed review. According to reports from various sources, the government's administration in the future will focus on the following aspects: (1) Emphasizing self-reliance; foreign loans will only be accepted if they have no political conditions. (2) Striving to reform politics, diligently governing, and especially expediting the rectification of governance in non-pacification areas, particularly striving to eliminate corruption. (3) Intensifying the suppression of bandits in the pacification areas. (4) Holding universal elections as scheduled to democratize politics. If these principles can be effectively implemented, China's politics will naturally take on a new look and embark on a path of revitalization. However, these principles today value action over empty talk. How to put them into practice? It requires not only the efforts of the government but also the awareness and determination of the people.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang frankly stated that when Special Envoy Wedemeyer was ordered to come to China in late July to investigate, the Chinese people held great hope for American aid. Everyone believed that the United States would be able to assist our economic construction and help us overcome the current difficulties. However, after Wedemeyer spent a month in China, his farewell remarks seemed to turn everyone's hopes into bubbles. Thus, the psychology of hoping for American aid has transformed into demanding that the government rely on its own efforts. In fact, this shift in psychology is simply human nature. Furthermore, we believe that only when we can first rely on our own efforts will foreign aid come unbidden. China's post-war reconstruction naturally needs foreign aid, and just like after World War I, the development of Chinese industry truly welcomes cooperation with international capital and technology. Therefore, China's return to seeking self-reliance first today is not based on emotions, nor does it contain any trace of xenophobia. Especially since the friendship between China and the United States is not superficial, if we can truly rely on our own efforts, then our American allies will surely "add flowers to the brocade."</p>
<p>We have repeatedly read and deeply felt Wedemeyer's farewell remarks. Although we do not yet know the government's attitude, we feel that Wedemeyer's visit to China seemed to be a futile trip, a superfluous act. According to a United Press International dispatch from Washington by Hans Lay, Wedemeyer made this statement seemingly implying a deep purpose. He demanded two points: (1) That the CCP be required to abandon its armed forces. (2) That the National Government be required to undertake thorough political and economic reforms. He seemed to want to use this document to pave the way for the National Government to request American aid, that is, to implement reforms. In fact, as far as these two points are concerned, they are not "new facts," and there was no need for a month-long investigation. The fact that the CCP is unwilling to voluntarily abandon its armed forces has long been known to China and the world. The principle that bandit suppression must be 70% political and 30% military was set by Chairman Chiang himself when he suppressed bandits in Jiangxi. Since the CCP cannot automatically lay down its weapons, the Chinese people must support the government in strengthening the work of bandit suppression, forcing the CCP to lay down its weapons before it is too late. As for the political and economic reforms undertaken by the government, they are being carried out step by step after the promulgation of the Constitution by the National Assembly. In the future, we can only seek to improve ourselves, strengthening our administrative efficiency and making our social customs more in line with the difficult wartime life.</p>
<p>However, while we do our best, we cannot but point out that the United States bears a moral responsibility for the brewing and expansion of the Chinese civil war. There are two reasons why the CCP bandits have grown so powerful: (1) They benefited from unrealistic "peace talks," which allowed them to expand their strength within a year. This urging of "peace talks" was precisely a highlight of the American government's policy toward China. (2) They benefited from the aid provided by the Soviet Union after it occupied Northeast China. The reason why the Soviet Union had this opportunity was due to the "selling out" of its Chinese ally by the United States at the Yalta Conference. Therefore, although we should deeply blame ourselves for the expansion of the civil war in China today, from the perspective of the indivisible international factors of peace, the United States should also bear a considerable responsibility. Wedemeyer did not analyze the facts that led to the CCP's rise, nor did he explain any concrete measures to resolve these facts. He merely issued some superficial platitudes, believing that the United States' temporary refusal to aid China, etc., would benefit the overall situation.</p>
<p>Taking a step back, we believe that Wedemeyer's farewell remarks were made with good intentions and can be regarded as his admonishment to the Chinese government. However, speaking in such a tone without waiting to return to the United States was unwise. The New York Times also stated that Wedemeyer's statement was tantamount to issuing an ultimatum to the Chinese government, ordering it to reform. Everything in China needs reform, but must all reforms be exactly as the American friends intend? Must the Chinese way of life be completely transformed into the American way of life? Must all the institutions of the Chinese government be completely changed into American institutions before they are satisfied? It must be understood that the reform of China's political economy is one thing, while America's desire to use "dollar diplomacy" to order China to accept its commands and teachings is another. Recently, Britain refused to accept American loans, and at the same time, the United States is becoming increasingly strict with the terms of its loans, either attaching political conditions or requiring supervision of their use. These facts make us gradually believe that the United States' loans to other countries are not based on the happiness of the people of those countries, nor are they focused on mutual benefit and the overall global situation, but are merely based on its own temporary interests. In fact, if the whole world is truly poor and there are no more "dollars," then the United States will face overproduction and will once again suffer a major economic crisis!</p>
<p>Now we must reflect on ourselves! We can learn many useful lessons from Wedemeyer's blunt statement. First, we Chinese people have always valued "loyalty" and "trust" in the way we make friends. We regard the United States as our close friend, believing that it should know how to "send charcoal in the snow," but we did not expect that the United States is just a friend who is "someone when there is trouble, and no one when there is no trouble." Second, under the current international situation, "international cooperation" and "world peace" are just slogans. If China wants to safeguard the integrity of its territorial sovereignty, it must constantly strive to become stronger and must not have any thoughts of relying on foreign countries. Third, under the condition of not harming sovereignty and national dignity, we can accept foreign aid, but we must not easily accept foreign loans unless absolutely necessary. There is a Chinese saying, "Even if we are poor, we must be tough." We are unwilling to eat food that is offered with contempt!</p>
<p>We must also thank Wedemeyer for his frank remarks, which have given us a deeper understanding of the United States! It has further deepened our belief in "self-reliance"!</p>
<h3>Former Head of Nazi Intelligence in North China Arrested in Beiping After Hiding for Two Years; Schmidt Escorted to Shanghai with Other German Nationals Yesterday</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Beiping, 30th] Two American (C-47 type) transport planes took off from here on the 30th, carrying seventeen Nazi German nationals being repatriated, including family members. The pilots said that due to strong winds, they might be forced to land in Nanjing instead of flying directly to Shanghai. If the bad weather changes the flight path, these German nationals will travel from Nanjing to Shanghai by train or switch to a C-54 type plane, as the C-54 type plane is better able to cope with bad weather. Among those being evacuated was Schmidt, the former head of the Nazi "Gestapo" in North China. Schmidt went into hiding after Japan surrendered. After two years and eleven days of diligent investigation, Chinese officials finally captured him on the evening of the 29th in a cellar in the basement of a German woman's house. Schmidt's name is Yuheim, also known as Zhang Zong. He went to Tokyo when Germany surrendered and later returned to Beiping, where he went into hiding.</p>
<h3>Gong Guoliang Declared Innocent; Prosecutor Appeals for Retrial</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 30th] Gong Guoliang, the former commander of the puppet Third Division, was previously declared innocent by the Criminal Division of the Jiangsu High Court because there was evidence of his defection. The prosecuting attorney believes that the defendant initially held the puppet position of pacification commander of the Suzhou area under the Renovation Government without central approval, and there is no record to be found. He also made absurd remarks in puppet newspapers, openly criticizing resistance against Japan as blind. He was later promoted to commander of the Third Division. Although he was sentenced to imprisonment for his defection, it is uncertain whether his defection was sincere or merely self-deception. The Criminal Division failed to conduct a thorough investigation and prematurely declared him innocent, which is difficult to accept. Therefore, on the 30th, they prepared a statement of reasons and applied to the Supreme Court to overturn the original judgment and order a retrial.</p>

<h3>Four Powers Confer on Korean Situation; Our Government Agrees to Participate; U.S. Note Sternly Criticizes Soviet Union for Violating Agreements</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] Diplomatic sources say that the proposal by the U.S. government to invite the Chinese, British, and Soviet governments to hold a four-nation conference in Washington to establish an independent and unified Korea was originally proposed by our government. On April 14th of this year, Foreign Minister Wang of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a letter to Marshall on the Korean issue, stating that the Chinese government believes that if the U.S. and the Soviet Union, which are currently occupying Korea, cannot reach an agreement as soon as possible, then the four nations of China, the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union, which participated in the Moscow Agreement on the Korean issue in December of the previous year, should immediately hold full consultations to seek a solution. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has now received a formal invitation from the U.S. government regarding this meeting and is expected to respond to the U.S. government within the next two or three days, expressing its agreement to participate.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 29th] The State Department today requested a four-power conference of China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to promote the independence and unification of Korea. A spokesperson for the British Ambassador here indicated that Britain would be happy to participate in this conference.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 29th] The United States today convened a meeting of the four major Pacific powers to discuss thorough new proposals to break the U.S.-Soviet deadlock on the issue of Korean independence. Under Secretary of State Lovett sent a strong note to Moscow, inviting the Soviet Union to join the United States, Britain, and China in holding such a conference in Washington on September 8th. If the Soviet Union refuses, the United States may appeal to the United Nations or unilaterally strive to establish the economic strength of southern Korea. Regardless of the Soviet Union's decision, diplomatic officials have made it clear that the U.S. government is determined to break the Korean deadlock. Lovett's note was delivered to the Soviet government yesterday by U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith in response to a note from Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov last Saturday. Lovett stated that according to the report of the U.S. representatives to the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission on Korea, the Soviet representatives will not agree to any proposals to resolve the issue of Korean political groups expressing their opinions. The Soviet representatives insisted on unilateral privileges, excluding groups with dissenting opinions. This position "not only violates the agreement between you and Secretary of State Marshall but also violates the democratic principles of freedom of expression." Regarding Molotov's accusation that the United States is oppressing or mistreating Koreans, the note stated: The United States is responsible for maintaining law and order in southern Korea without interfering with democratic rights, which is fully demonstrated by the expression and respect for all political views in the U.S. occupation zone, etc.</p>
<h3>U.S. Presents Concrete Suggestions for Establishing a Korean Provisional Government</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 29th] In his note to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, Under Secretary of State Lovett presented the following U.S. suggestions regarding Korea: (1) General elections should be held as soon as possible in both the Soviet and U.S. occupation zones of Korea to elect fully representative provisional assemblies in each zone. Elections must be conducted according to the principles of universal suffrage, secret multi-party voting, and in accordance with the laws currently adopted by the Korean assemblies in each zone. (2) The number of members of the provisional district assemblies should be proportional to the population of the two zones. Then, all the members should form a national provisional assembly, which should meet in Seoul to establish a provisional government for a unified Korea. (3) The provisional government of this unified Korea should hold regular meetings with representatives of the four powers related to the Moscow Agreement on Korea to determine what kind of assistance and aid is needed to give Korea an independent, solid economic and political foundation, and what the conditions for this assistance and aid should be. (4) During the above stages, the United Nations should be invited to send observers to Korea so that the world and the Korean people can be sure that the actions taken are fully representative and fully independent. (5) The Korean provisional government and the four powers concerned should agree on a date for the complete withdrawal of all occupying forces in Korea. (6) The provisional assemblies in each zone should work to draft a provisional constitution, which will serve as a blueprint when the national assembly passes a Korean constitution for the entire Korea in the future. (7) Before the establishment of a unified and independent Korea, public and private institutions in each zone should maintain contact with the United Nations or various international institutions within the United Nations. At the same time, Korean representatives should be encouraged to attend formal international conferences under appropriate circumstances.</p>

<h3>Van Mook Issues Strong Statement Rejecting UN Arbitration and Vows to Strive to Attack Yogyakarta</h3>
<p>[Reported by the News Agency] San Francisco, 30th Broadcast: The Dutch Gazette published that the Indonesian Republican Army is constantly attacking the Dutch.

Van Mook also denounced the submission of the Indonesian issue to the United Nations as "an act that violates international law." Van Mook appealed to the world to recognize the current situation, saying, "Our responsibility cannot be restricted or usurped by resolutions or committees." He also said that the Netherlands does not oppose international investigations, but always believes that this matter is purely an internal issue. According to sources close to Van Mook, if the Netherlands does not launch another offensive against Yogyakarta, he may resign.</p>

<h3>Japanese Demand Return of Islands East of Hokkaido</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 30th] The Japanese are gradually expressing their desire to reclaim the two large islands and several small islands at the eastern end of Hokkaido, which are currently occupied by Soviet forces. The people of Nemuro Prefecture held a meeting demanding the return of the islands located nearby that are under Soviet occupation. They declared that the islands have belonged to Japan for more than 200 years. The islands they are demanding be returned include Kunashiri Island, Etorofu Island, and the Habomai Islands. The Hokkaido Prefectural Assembly first requested the return of the islands a month ago, resolving to petition MacArthur, requesting the return of the islands. The Nemuro Prefecture People's Conference declared that if the islands belong to the Soviet Union, the blood ties between us and the 16,000 people on the islands will be severed, and our economic ties will also be completely severed.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Approves Peace Treaties with Five Nations</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 29th] Moscow Radio said that the Supreme Soviet has approved the peace treaties with the five nations of Italy, Romania, Hungary, Finland, and Bulgaria.</p>
<p>[Reported by the News Agency] London, 30th Broadcast: According to well-informed sources in Paris, after the Soviet Union approved the peace treaties with the five nations, it is expected that the four powers will sign the peace treaty with Italy. The signing ceremony will be kept simple, with French Foreign Minister Bidault, British Ambassador to France Cooper, U.S. Ambassador Caffery, and Soviet Ambassador Bogomolov representing their respective governments in signing the treaty.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 30th] U.S. officials were greatly surprised by the Soviet Union's approval of the peace treaties with the Axis satellite states, as they believed that the Soviet Union would delay the approval process for several months. A fear has arisen in diplomatic circles that after the British and American troops withdraw from Italy, the Soviets will take advantage of the situation. Currently, Britain and the United States have 20,000 troops stationed in Italy. The treaty stipulates that the Soviet Union may station an unspecified number of troops in Romania and Hungary to protect traffic with the Austrian occupation zone. It is not easy to reduce the number of Soviet troops stationed in these two countries, as the Soviet Union's plan to control the Austrian government is still in its early stages.</p>

<p>Large-Scale Gold Trading Case Cracked in Jinling East Road - Over a Thousand Taels of Gold Confiscated - Branch Offices Established in Major Ports - Principal Offender Attempts Bribery but is Refused [This Newspaper's Report] The Economic Section of the Police Bureau cracked a large-scale black market gold operation at 11:00 AM yesterday on the fourth floor of No. 41 Jinling East Road, confiscating over 1,200 taels of large and small gold bars on the spot. The principal offender, Yu Jixi from Xiamen, was also arrested. The police bureau put in a great deal of effort into cracking this case. After Economic Section Chief Xu Youzuo initially obtained this clue, he sent personnel to investigate. The results only revealed that the place was a company dealing in imported and exported cotton yarn industrial raw materials, named Yicheng. The people who went in and out were all upper-class figures, and for five days, no suspicious points could be found. Finally, Xu decided to go there himself in disguise, on the pretext of visiting a friend, to understand the truth. He then discovered that there were four suites inside. At that time, there was only one apprentice on duty in the outer room, seemingly waiting for someone, and an alarm bell was installed next to his writing desk. Seeing Xu arrive, he scrutinized him with surprised eyes and asked questions in detail. Xu responded vaguely and inadvertently noticed telegrams from Hong Kong and Macau on the table. However, the apprentice was very alert and quickly locked the telegrams in the drawer. Subsequently, Xu learned from the second landlord that the company had frequent correspondence, but there was no sign of any business activities.</p>
<p>Implementation of Search - At 11:00 AM yesterday, after Xu obtained approval from Director Ruan, he ordered officers Si Yun-kui, Wang Dong, Xiong Qu-jiao, and Xu Xiaoshu to go for a search. After breaking in, they first took out the telegrams and secret codes from the drawer. At the same time, they searched all the rooms and arrested the principal offender Yu Jixi in the last room, confiscating 72 large gold bars from Shanghai, 98 five-tael gold bars from Hong Kong, and about three taels of gold ornaments and small bars in a small box. In addition, they also found a scale and two specially made vests for carrying gold bars. On the other hand, they deciphered the original text of the secret telegram as "Currently being carried by two people, each carrying 150 taels. The rest is packed and shipped out." At this point, the principal offender Yu Jixi's face turned pale, and he knelt down and begged, offering a huge amount of gold bars as a bribe, but was refused by the police officers. He was then taken to the police station for interrogation.</p>
<p>According to Yu Jixi's confession, their organization has a background and is jointly operated by more than ten people, with branch offices set up in Ping, Jin, Hong Kong, Yue, and Ao. All the gold bars are smuggled from Hong Kong and Macau to Shanghai. Under his name, there are a total of 300 taels of gold bars, and the rest belong to others. He also said that he hopes the police bureau will not pursue the root cause.</p>
<p>As for the gold bars that have been seized, they were temporarily kept after being sealed by Police Bureau Chief Xu and Commissioner Wu of the Central Bank yesterday. After weighing them tomorrow, they will be sent to the Central Bank. The suspects are temporarily detained in the detention center, and the case will be reported to the Ministry of Finance for review.</p>

<p>General Mobilization Conference for the Cultural Sector to Suppress Rebellion and Save the Country Established Yesterday - Fully Encourage the Morale of the Soldiers on the Front Lines to Suppress Bandits - Awaken Society to Complete the Wartime System [This Newspaper's Report] The General Mobilization Conference for the Cultural Sector to Suppress Rebellion and Save the Country was held at the Cultural Center on Zhapu Road at 3:00 PM yesterday. Representatives from various agencies and cultural groups in the city, including the Xinhai Revolution Comrades Association, the Chinese Photographic Society, the Photography Reporters Association, the Book Industry Association, the Philosophy and Numerology Research Association, the Beijing Opera Theater Workers' Union, the Cantonese Opera Association, the Analects Society, the Dadong Bookstore, the Qianghua Sports Association, the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts, and Nianhua Girls' High School, totaling more than 300 representatives from over 40 units, attended. The walls on both sides of the venue were decorated with more than a dozen cartoons of the atrocities of the Communist bandits, which were shocking. On the left and right sides of the rostrum were two large neon signs with the words "Suppress Rebellion and Build the Country, Cultural Mobilization," which were thought-provoking.</p>
<p>After the meeting began, Chairman Pan Gongzhan delivered a speech, saying: "After the victory, the Communist bandits used peace as a smokescreen to launch a rebellion. In order to put the country on the road to democracy and unification as soon as possible, the government repeatedly made concessions and negotiated with them in every way from last winter to this spring in order to quickly find a peaceful solution. However, the Communist bandits had no sincerity, expanded the war, and recently requested foreign aid, recklessly destroying with their inhuman violence. Their behavior is completely equivalent to the mob in history and the fifth column in the international community, and they are extremely insane. After compromising, the government saw that the Communist bandits were unrepentant, so it decided to order the suppression of the rebellion. The purpose of this suppression of the rebellion is to seek the real peaceful unification of the country, so it has won the support of the people of the whole country. The cultural sector is the hub of all work and should lead the people of the whole country to carry out a general mobilization in spirit and thought. On the one hand, we must fully encourage the morale of the soldiers on the front lines to suppress the bandits, and on the other hand, we must awaken society to abandon extravagant habits and complete the wartime system, focusing all our energy on suppressing the rebellion, so that the country can achieve stability as soon as possible. With so many cultural groups in Shanghai at present, if we can be of one heart and one mind, the impact on the whole country in the future will be great, so I hope that people in the cultural sector will earnestly shoulder this important mission of the times."</p>
<p>After everyone stood up and silently mourned the soldiers who died in the suppression of the bandits for three minutes, Zhang Daofan, Chairman of the Central Cultural Movement Committee, and Fang Zhi, Chairman of the Municipal Party Headquarters, delivered speeches respectively, elaborating on the goals of the general mobilization of the cultural sector in detail. Finally, the organizational outline was discussed and the persons in charge of each group were elected, and the meeting adjourned at 4:30 PM with shouts of slogans. After the meeting, a declaration was issued, a telegram of respect was sent to Chairman Chiang, and a circular telegram was sent to the cultural sector across the country.</p>

<p>Scalpers Active in Front of Theaters - Black Market Ticket Prices Tripled - Audience Complains [This Newspaper's Report] Movie theaters have been preparing to raise prices for a long time, and it was rumored for a time that the new ticket prices would be implemented on September 1. Although the film merchants and the Social Affairs Bureau have not yet reached an agreement, the price increase principle has been agreed to by the authorities, and adjusting the ticket price is only a matter of time. Most movie fans are unwilling to give up this last chance, so movie theaters in the city have been particularly crowded in recent days, and scalpers have taken advantage of this to engage in major activities, especially on the weekend yesterday, which was even more rampant. At 8:00 AM, before the theaters opened, the scalpers were already lined up waiting. When ticket sales started at 9:30 AM, the scalpers rushed in and immediately sold out all the upstairs and downstairs tickets for all four screenings of the day. Yesterday morning, reporters patrolled the major theaters and found that all screenings for the next two days were full by about 10:00 AM, and all the tickets were taken over by scalpers, even the early screenings on Sunday were not spared. According to the investigation, the black market price of a night show ticket at 9:15 was as high as 30,000 yuan (original price 12,000), and the ordinary price was also doubled. The audience complained that the police and security authorities did not take any action to crack down. It is understood that the daily income of "scalpers" often reaches 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, and after deducting the necessary "expenses," the net income of 4 to 5 million yuan per month is very common. However, they are also quite organized, with the scope of activities divided into regions, and it is extremely difficult for outsiders to participate.</p>
<p>Dramatic Incident of Robbers Resisting Arrest - Police Inspectors and Sergeants Nearly Assassinated - Bullets Flying on Yuezhou Road, Five Criminals Apprehended [This Newspaper's Report] Ying Liangyuan, a resident of No. 15 Qin'yi North Lane, Yuezhou Road, Shanghai, is an accountant at Hongchang New Cotton Cloth Shop. The upstairs is rented to the Cao family. At about 9:00 AM yesterday, five robbers suddenly came. Two of them had Mauser pistols, and one had a wooden-cased gun. They forcibly took two gold rings and three inlaid gemstone rings from the hands of Ying's old wife and daughter-in-law. After driving the women and children into the back room of the living room, they tied them up with ropes, searched for the keys, and went upstairs to steal gold and silver jewelry, clothes, and clocks. At the same time, the Cao family's room was also looted. Coincidentally, Ying's younger sister-in-law returned from outside and noticed that the back door was closed and heard rude noises. Realizing that something was wrong, she turned around and ran out of the lane. She happened to meet Cao Chen, the landlady upstairs, who told her about the robbery. Cao Chen and others reported to the nearby police. Upon receiving the report, Fu Sugang, the director of the Tilanqiao Police Precinct, immediately ordered Ma Zhuyu, the head of the Criminal Investigation Section, to lead Police Inspectors Lin Jiyi and Yu Yingkai, Police Sergeants Gao Fuhou and Ding Yichen, and Police Officers Zhang Shukai and Chen Dianzeng to drive two motorcycles to the lane entrance. They saw two robbers at the back door of No. 15, and one robber immediately pulled out a gun and fired at Police Inspector Lin, but fortunately missed. He then fired two shots at Police Sergeant Gao, who fell to the ground to avoid the bullets and escaped unharmed, but his police hat was pierced with a hole. He then returned fire, hitting the robber in the right arm. The two robbers were eventually captured. Soon after, Director Fu, along with Deputy Director Wang Xiweng, the chiefs of the First and Third Sections, and a large number of uniformed police officers, arrived in jeep-style police vehicles. They first cordoned off the lane entrance, cutting off traffic on the road. At this time, the third robber opened the front door with the help of the fourth robber in an attempt to escape. Police Sergeant Ding fired more than ten rounds from a Thompson submachine gun, and the two robbers were captured. All the stolen gold jewelry was recovered.

They had committed many previous crimes.</p>
<p>Englishman Chiley Appears in Court - Wife Waits Outside the Door - Kissing and Embracing - Arrogant Attitude During Trial, Confesses to Committing Fraud and Being Sentenced [This Newspaper's Report] Englishman Chiley Aquiet, suspected of assassinating black market gold broker Yu Shengxiao, was escorted to the detention center of the District Court by the police bureau yesterday morning. At around 10:00 AM yesterday morning, Tao Ronggen, the section chief of the Criminal Investigation Section of the Police Bureau, and his staff Xu Guoji, along with police officers, escorted Chiley to the court in a jeep. Chiley was wearing a straw hat, a white shirt, light blue pants, and white leather shoes with yellow trim, and his handcuffs were covered with a silk scarf. His Russian wife waited at the entrance of the court and handed him sandwiches, coffee, bananas, grapes, and other items, and they talked for about half an hour. Before leaving, they kissed and embraced again. At 12:00 PM, Judge Zhu Yuhuang took his seat in the Criminal Division of the court to hear the case. Chiley confessed that he was a British national, 33 years old, and lived at No. 18, Lane 188, Albert Road. He had committed fraud in Shanghai in 1941 and was sentenced to six months in prison. He had known Yu Shengxiao in the past and had done business with him, buying and selling gold and silver dollars. On the first of this month, a US military officer named Malley discussed buying gold bars with him. Malley asked him to negotiate the purchase with Yu Shengxiao, saying that the transaction would take place in the countryside of Qingpu. At about 5:00 PM, he drove his car along the Shanghai-Qingpu Highway, with Malley and Yu Shengxiao sitting in the back. When they reached Qingpu County, Malley suddenly shot Yu and seized the five gold bars that Yu was carrying. He did not receive any gold bars, etc. Chiley was arrogant and cunning in his testimony yesterday. The court ordered the bailiffs to detain him and reschedule the hearing because the case still needed to be investigated further.</p>

<p>Understanding the Pain of Dropping Out of School, Helping Others Is the Source of Happiness - Jin Lianghong Saves Money on Leather Shoes to Respond to the Scholarship Assistance [This Newspaper's Report] Regarding the fundraising campaign for the reader scholarship assistance program launched by this newspaper, after publishing Shen Wenhua's letter yesterday, the newspaper received 200,000 yuan donated by reader Jin Lianghong yesterday, along with a letter as follows: "Editor: After reading Mr. Shen Wenhua's letter in the newspaper today, I was greatly moved. I express my deepest sympathy to Mr. Shen and the students who have suffered the same fate as Mr. Shen. I am currently studying medicine at a church university. My father is the chief accountant of a bank. Although our family cannot be called 'rich,' it can be considered a 'comfortable family.' I remember ten years ago, the flames of the War of Resistance forced us to flee from other cities to Shanghai. At that time, my father lost his job and became ill. The savings of several years were all spent on fleeing, and the family's financial situation fell into extreme distress. At that time, I was only in the fifth grade of elementary school. I remember that I also dropped out of school for two years because I couldn't pay the sixteen yuan tuition fee, otherwise I would have graduated this year. Although eight years have passed, that desolate scene has always been etched in my mind.</p>
<p>School is about to start, and although I no longer have to worry about 'tuition fees,' I understand the pain of dropping out of school and know the taste of it. Now, I have saved 200,000 yuan from the money for leather shoes and donated it to your newspaper's scholarship assistance program as a small contribution. Although there is a big hole in the sole of my leather shoes, I feel extra comfort in my heart. Best wishes. Yu Lianghong"</p>

<p>Ordinary Team - Team 26, Yu Lianghong Scholarship Team: 200,000 yuan Team 27, Shen Liuchun Congratulates Shen Bao 75th Anniversary Team: 200,000 yuan</p>

<p>The Revelation of Goethe's Personality in Spring and Autumn</p>
<p>By Yan Zhewu - Written for Goethe's Birthday on August 28th</p>
<p>A glance at the history of world literature reveals four epoch-making and great poets in Europe, both ancient and modern: Homer in ancient times, Dante in the 13th century, Shakespeare in the 16th century, and Goethe in the 18th century, a versatile genius who was as famous as Napoleon.</p>
<p>Goethe was born on August 28, 1749. In Germany, and even in the Soviet Union and various European countries, grand celebrations and commemorations are held on this day. He is indeed an unparalleled literary genius and a saint in the German literary world. Before Goethe emerged, Germany was always regarded by France and other European countries as "the most foolish nation," but after Goethe was discovered, he was hailed as "the jade of the European literary world." Even Napoleon said, "This is truly a man!"</p>
<p>Goethe's life was marked by vast knowledge and versatility. He was a statesman, thinker, scientist, and poet; he was a color theorist, zoologist, mineralogist, botanist, and geologist. He studied philosophy, law, and medicine, yet his entire personality was fully expressed in his lifelong literary works. He experienced and explored various aspects of life, but in all his endeavors, he never lost his "self"!</p>
<p>The complete Goethean personality is, in fact, the continuous completion of countless Goethes. The young Goethe was different from the old Goethe, and from youth to old age, there was Goethe the university student, Goethe of The Sorrows of Young Werther, Goethe of the Weimar court, Goethe traveling in Italy, Goethe in conversation with Schiller, Goethe the saint in conversation with Eckermann... and each change in Goethe's life revealed a significant meaning in human life.</p>
<p>Goethe's life was one of eternal change, but when he developed a new inclination towards each new life, he immersed himself in it with all his spirit and personality. His life's thoughts, emotions, and intellect were constantly in contradiction, conflict, distress, and dissatisfaction, but in the end, he always resolutely abandoned the old and retreated bravely, even more courageously entering into another new pursuit. Therefore, it can be said that Goethe's life was not a journey from error to truth, but a continuous experience of all kinds of forms of human life. This eternal change of personality was also confessed in Goethe's "Faust":</p>
<p>"I want to deeply experience within my inner self, to experience everything that all mankind is endowed with, the most sublime and the most profound I must understand, I want to pile up the joys and sorrows of all mankind in my chest, my ego will expand to become the great self of all mankind. I wish to perish together with all mankind in the end."</p>
<p>This kind of great pursuit of a diversified life, affirming the meaning of life, constantly pursuing, making contradictions often return to harmony, and optimistically clinging to the ever-changing phenomena, enduring all joys and sorrows, daring to throw oneself into the rush of the times and under the wheels of events, and forever facing the future, holding the reins of the galloping destiny, driving forward towards the endless. This spirit of a warrior on the battlefield of life is also the shining light of a poet, and it is truly worthy of our respect and learning.</p>
<h3>Crying for Mother</h3>
<p>By Tian Di - Also Accusing the Crimes of the Chinese Communist Party</p>
<p>"In the deep night of July 25, 1946 (June 27th in the lunar calendar), Tian Yuan Chuanyun, a fifty-year-old woman, along with three other elderly victims, were innocently shot in the area controlled by the Chinese Communist Party at the time, the ancient city of Lai'an, in the so-called Suwan Border Region Government. This is just one of the countless massacres committed by the Chinese Communist Party in eastern Anhui..."</p>
<p>Last summer, on a stormy night, within the so-called Suwan Liberated Area—the ancient city of Lai'an County—my dear mother, a kind and gentle old woman, was shot by Chinese Communist Party members who used slogans such as advancement, revolution, and liberation as a guise, groundlessly shooting an old woman who had no political influence and no ability to resist. This is a</p>
<p>painful tragedy and a debt of blood.</p>
<p>Years have passed. Tonight, it is again a storm of wind and rain. I turn off the lights and sit quietly by the window. It is as if I hear my mother's desperate cries for help before her execution in the sound of ten thousand horses galloping in the rain. I faintly smell the thick scent of blood! It is as if I see my mother's blood gushing out of her wounds on the vast wilderness... Time only deepens my painful memory, arousing my hatred, anger, and endless sorrow!</p>
<p>I have been separated from my mother for eight years. In these long and protracted years, my mother, with the spirit of a martyr, guarded the dilapidated countryside and the broken home. Under the Chinese Communist Party's various forms of oppression, humiliation, and all-out control, she lived a life of poverty and hardship, living the life of an ox or horse, suffering humiliation and harm. Watching her children, like fledglings learning to fly, one after another leave the nest, her late years were marked by poverty and illness, just like the ancient cypress tree outside the gate of her old residence, which was burned to death by the carelessness of the Chinese Communist Party during the "false clearing" of houses. For a long time, only withered branches remained standing, lonely passing away her dim days; watching her fifth son die young, watching our elder sisters, one by one, like kites with broken strings, unable to find any news, watching life become more and more difficult day by day, eating black wheat, ground fungus, and tree bark while having to rush to make "army shoes"... Why was my mother able to endure such hardship and iron torture with pleasure? Wasn't it a great belief, a bright vision that encouraged her old age's courage to live? That is: "There will always be a day when the devils are defeated, and my husband and children will return one after another, and we will relive the life of family reunion before the war!"</p>
<p>Indeed, victory has come, but happiness does not belong to us. Our mother was brutally shot to death by people, by bandits, by the most cruel executioners in the world. When we were able to enter our old home, besides tracing the outline of our mother's life from the dilapidated walls, our mother left this world with a coffin full of tears and grievances. Besides kneeling in front of the overgrown grave and weeping bitterly, how can we repay the mother who raised us, and even more, how can we avenge the mother and those who suffered the same tragic fate as her!</p>
<p>In a thatched cottage, seeing my grandmother, who was dying and lingering on her sickbed, we held back our rolling tears. My grandmother tried hard to open her lifeless eyes. My grandmother's shoulders twitched, and old tears streamed down her face. Her dry mouth muttered softly: "Children: you have come too late, you will never see your mother again..."</p>
<p>After that, after many inquiries, we learned that my mother was monitored even more strictly after the enemy surrendered, as if they were afraid that she would enter the free area. Therefore, two months before her martyrdom, she had a painful conversation with an elderly relative: "If Tang'er comes back, I'm afraid mother and son will never see each other again!" It can be seen that my mother knew at that time that she could not escape death, but why didn't she leave this den of tigers immediately? And why did she die? She didn't think that, in her heart, wasn't it because she was ill and didn't have the courage to endure the suffering of life, especially fearing that the Communist area would not be easily recovered for a while, and if she dragged on for a few more years, she would also be dragged to death? How could she have thought that she would be killed like a pure and kind old sheep, otherwise, I think my mother must have tried to escape!</p>
<p>Who in the world is without a mother? If the Chinese Communist Party members have any humanity left, they should never have committed such a vicious and stupid massacre. Putting themselves in her place, if the mothers of Mao Zedong and his party members were innocently killed, and they suffered the pain of losing their mothers, what would they think? This is an irreconcilable hatred. Why do they allow their party members to be so vicious and evil?</p>
<p>After several repressions, standing on the position of a journalist, initially, in order to take care of the peace of the whole country, I was unwilling to announce this ironclad fact, this painful tragedy, to the people of the country, for fear of being considered alarmist. I once held back tears, bearing sorrow, and enduring anger, and interviewed back and forth among the various parties participating in the peace talks, my only hope being: that when peace is realized, weapons of war can be transformed into jade and silk, and the murderers can be brought to justice under the majestic law. But the facts have disappointed us! Since I cannot seek the arrest of the murderer for my mother under the unified and peaceful situation, then I can only ask for help from the world, from compatriots who truly love democracy and freedom and safeguard the country and the nation. I believe that I am just one of the millions who have suffered such unfortunate encounters. I accuse the crimes of the Chinese Communist Party!</p>
<p>Countrymen, we must investigate the debt of blood! We must prevent these tragic events from being staged indefinitely on the land of our motherland! We demand that the law arrest the murderer for me, demand that the government protect our most basic life, we support the General Mobilization Order for the Suppression of the Rebellion, we want to accuse the world, the Chinese Communist Party is not only an armed rebel bandit gang, but also a butcher who destroys human nature! (Revised in July during a journey in Liuhe)</p>

<h3>Su Wu Herding Sheep (Woodcut)</h3>
<p>By Zhao Jingshen - The New Work of Sinclair Lewis</p>
<p>Who would have thought that the son of old Doc Lewis, Harry Lewis, whose nickname is Doodle, would have today's achievements. He worked as a night clerk in a hotel in Sauk Centre, Minnesota. Later, he worked for the local "Weekly," "New Haven Journal-Courier," and the San Francisco "Bulletin." The manager of the Bulletin even suspended him, saying he was an incompetent interviewer. He was ugly, with a face full of freckles and red hair, but he could interview beautiful yarn. At Yale University, he wrote poetry and edited "Lit," and later stoked the stove for Sinclair. He lived in New York, worked as a social worker, and also worked as a secretary for two female writers, selling novels and newspapers. From 1914 to 1919, he wrote five novels that people have forgotten. In 1920, his "Main Street" was published, and he finally gained a reputation. Two years later, "Babbitt" increased his reputation. Later, he published "Elmer Gantry," "Arrowsmith" (for which he refused the Pulitzer Prize), "Dodsworth," "Ann Vickers," and "It Can't Happen Here." He was the first Nobel Prize in Literature winner. He divorced twice, the first time from Grace Hegger, and the second time from Dorothy Thompson. His two sons, Wells, died in battle; Mickael is a tall man and is still in school. Whether working or playing, his strength is atomic. He also wrote a play called "Our Town," and may write another play soon.</p>
<p>Recently, Lewis (Sinclair Lewis) has written another book, "Kingsblood Royal," which is his twentieth novel. Don't think that this is another novel about the black slave problem, in fact, it is not just about the black slave problem, but a novel about the American problem. The general idea is that Kingsblood is a tall, red-haired American who works as an assistant accountant at the Second National Bank of the Republic of Minnesota. If the author had let him become the bank manager, achieve success, and nothing unpleasant happened, and he died peacefully, there would be nothing surprising. However, Kingsblood discovered that there were invisible chemical traces of black people in his skin. He looked for his family tree and found that his mother's family was a descendant of black people. He himself is the thirty-second generation of this black man.</p>
<p>After the discovery, Kingsblood had three paths to take: first, he could hide what he knew. Second, he could still claim to be white and work secretly for black people. Third, he could announce to the public that he was a descendant of black people. Later, he observed black people and felt that the general public's views on how good or bad black people are were biased. There are good people and bad people among black people; there are dirty people and clean people; there are ugly people and beautiful people, just like Americans. They don't want people to like them, praise them, nor do they want people to fear them, torture them. Black people only want to be treated as ordinary people. They are willing to be Babbitts, Elmer Gantrys, Arrowsmiths, Ann Vickerses, or Kingsbloods. They don't want to be seen as too high or too low. They have no special virtues, nor special sins.</p>
<p>Americans are also beginning to understand, but only in their hearts. Americans should see black people as having no racial distinction and as being the same as themselves, so I say this is America's problem.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain and River, an Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>By Ye Jingfeng 883</p>
<p>Yaoqun was fine, of course, she greeted everyone with the old routine, asking after each other's well-being, but this little tiger suffered.</p>
<p>Child… come here!</p>
<p>Although Grandma didn't rest for half the night, her spirit was not diminished at all. As soon as she saw her son, he was still so… still that… good, from head to toe, nothing more. Nothing was missing at all, and she was relieved. Her heart was full of joy, needless to say, but besides her face and eyebrows being full of smiles, there were also two lines of hot tears: "Child… even if you are a squad leader, aren't you? Big or small, you are still an official… You can't do it with your little ability, can you? … Come! … Although you have traveled thousands of miles and come back from so far away, you must be tired, right? But we can't be rude… First, pay your respects to Aunt Ji and tell her 'excuse me,' then kowtow to your uncle… you also have to kowtow to these uncles, grand-uncles, uncles, grandmothers, and aunts… Then go to the hall with your mother, and all the elders of the grandfather's generation are waiting there, you all have to… later…</p>
<p>There is also your grandfather's spirit tablet in the room… and your father's tablet!…" Statistically, there were about one hundred and forty-five kowtows.</p>
<p>Yaoqun only planned to stay in the village for one day, so after the welcoming reception and other events ended, she immediately invited Lord Long Wu and several head officials to the council hall to speak. This was the only goal of her trip.</p>
<p>"Young lady, you can't be polite with us," Lord Long Wu immediately interjected as soon as Yaoqun opened her mouth; "Whatever you say is good; even if we move the entire village to the customs, it's fine…!"</p>
<p>"That's what you say, Fifth Lord;" Yaoqun was preparing to express her plan: "The problem is not that simple. If it were that simple, why would I bother to make this trip? I could just send you a letter, right? … This is the old village, and this foundation is all made with blood and sweat… Moreover, both inside and outside the customs are equally important. My intention is to see if you can transfer twenty or thirty guys; but you can't just consider my side; this is not a matter of politeness… The people must also be selected, and it is important to solicit their consent, and everyone still has their own family problems, right?…"</p>
<p>As a result of the conversation, Yaoqun and Lord Long Wu established a rational approach; first, solicit the opinions of one positive and one deputy captain, give them a standard for selecting personnel, and let them recruit four squad leaders. Then, each squad leader would recruit four or five team members, adding up to almost thirty people in the entire team. This number sounds small, but the old village's guerrilla teams have never exceeded this number each time, which shows that their quality is top-notch, capable of standing up to a hundred.</p>
<p>Just as this recruitment method was decided, someone stood up from the official seat, raised a loudspeaker-like voice, and first coughed dryly, clearing the phlegm on his vocal cords:</p>
<p>"This task should simply be handed over to me and my brother Wu…" While speaking, Old Long struck a brave and heroic pose, giving a sweeping salute to all the councilors; this demeanor, in the terminology of Peking opera, was done very "skillfully," quite like Ma Yulong in "Tongjiawu" raising his "head," only lacking the gongs and drums of "bala qinqiang, zha, zha, zha…"</p>
<p>After saying this, Old Long opened his eyes as wide as possible, showing a heroic spirit, and glanced at Lord Long Wu and Yaoqun, etc., one by one, to see everyone's reaction to his request; at the end, he redirected his gaze back to Lord Long Wu and Yaoqun; and then put both hands together, making a gesture of ten.</p>

<h3>The World Divided into Two Major Blocs: Eisenhower Issues a Frank Warning</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 29th] General Dwight D. Eisenhower, U.S. Army Chief of Staff, addressed the American Military Order Association today, frankly pointing out that the world is already divided into two major blocs. He said that in order to maintain world peace, a strong United States is essential. To make the United States strong, universal military training must be promoted. Eisenhower stated: "We must recognize that the spirit of cooperation has been lost in the two years since the war, and the world is now divided into two major blocs. One is a bloc centered on a dictatorial system, under which the individual must submit to absolute control. The other is a bloc centered on a democratic system, which will give freedom to the individual." Eisenhower went on to say that he did not believe there was an immediate threat of another world war, as no major power in the world today hoped to gain anything from initiating a war. However, foresight and concentrated efforts are still necessary to maintain an adequate defensive posture at all times.</p>
