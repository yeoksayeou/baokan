<p>〔本報濟南廿六日電〕濟市東側外圍戰事，廿五日晚起擴展至市東三十八公里之籠山車站，進攻共軍約三數千人，迄廿六日午仍續戰中。龍山至益都間嘐濟路正錢十七車站及張博支綫五站，己全陷共軍之手。</p>
<h3>魯西南及津浦綫　國軍作袋形推進　三月初可能會師兗州</h3>
<p>〔本報徐州廿六日電〕陳毅此次料合十萬餘兵力，猛犯萊無博淄，其所採戰術，乃先進攻守軍背後，切斷後方聯絡錢，以孤立守軍。國軍七十七師三個團整，四十六師七軍三軍未整編在萊蕪吐絲口博山等地對來犯之共軍奮勇抗拒，喋血苦戰四畫夜，任務完成後，分別突圍轉移，共軍損失慘重，己一蹶不振。又共軍楊言犯濟南之目的，在掠奪物資，然國軍絕對有把握保衛濟南及其外圍。共軍犯膠濟路，旨在打通通膠東走廊。又軍方稱：國軍正由魯南，魯西及津浦正面以袋形陣地向北迅速推進。現陳毅殘部已陷入袋形陣地之口，現雖尙跳樑蠢動，但戰略上共軍已居於必敗之地矣。濟南，兗州國軍，三月初可在泰安會師。</p>

<h3>關心朝鮮的局勢</h3>
<p>在莫斯科外長會議召開的前夕，關於朝鮮的局勢又突引起世人的注意。朝鮮美軍占領區司令、長官霍奇將軍最近自任所返抵美京，向報界談稱：蘇軍當局在朝鮮占領區，現正以中共軍隊為核心，徵募十七歲至廿五歲之朝鮮壯丁，企圖組成龐大之朝鮮軍隊；而美方與蘇軍當局就地所進行之談判，前途似極少希望。蘇方在其占領區內鐵幕密布，殊使吾人難以獲悉其內情。同時朝鮮委員會主席李承晚亦在美京向記者談稱，要求美國武裝韓南人民，並准其進行軍事訓練。另據合衆社電訊，霍奇將軍又曾向記者宣稱，韓南將於三月一日成立單獨政府，彼正向國會預算委員會要求撥給充分之經費，俾可進行占領朝鮮之工作。國務院中人則稱，美國對朝鮮政策並無變更，美國現擬進行之方針有二：（一）鞏固韓南之經濟發展；（二）樹立所謂協議立法。現在從美國方而，續有關於朝鮮的報專傳來，朝鮮局勢無疑地必將引起世人一般的注意。</p>
<p>對於朝鮮的局勢，以我們與朝鮮地壞的相接，加以彼此問歷史文化關係的深切，我們無時不在密切關注之中。本報曩曾著論，喚起世人不可忽視在發展著的朝鮮局勢，我們認為硬以北緯三十八度將朝鮮劃成兩個世界，不特對於朝鮮民族的生存是一種人為的障得，抑且有背於此次世界作戰的崇高目的。朝鮮淪亡，瞬逾四十年。當共淪亡之際，正值帝國主義在遠東角逐之會。帝俄敗北，日本以英日同盟為後援，乃得為所欲為；朝鮮一時雖宣布獨立，曾幾何時，卽為日本所併吞。然三韓民族在民族意識方面，向極堅强；國雖淪亡，而民氣部並不消沉。安重根既襲擊伊藤於先，後些三十年間，朝鮮志士迭有英勇表現。今日日本戰犯重光葵的假腿和野村的假眼，都由於朝鮮志士壯烈的行動。第一次世界大戰，成爾遜總統提出了民族自決的原則，但不及於朝鮮，此已表示西方國家之如何不能負起世界秩序重建的電任。我們當時己為三韓人民表示扼腕；不料世界第二次大戰後出現在朝鮮的情形，其足以令人扼腕的程度部十百倍於當時：對於在苦難中的朝鮮人民，我們謹於此表示我們無限的同情。</p>
<p>誰造成這種出現於朝鮮的局勢的呢？這責任落在蘇美雙方。蘇聯在它的占領區內之欲扶殖足以對它有利的勢力原在想像之中：但美國占領軍當局在朝鮮之沒有明確的政策，坐使朝鮮的局勢日益惡化，此其所負的責任，當亦難辭。蘇聯在朝鮮的占領是有計劃的，而美國對朝鮮的占領卻沒有明確堅定的政策。今日朝鮮人民所受的苦難，主要就由於此。我們不能讓這種局面持續下去。本來，自從去年初，依據莫斯科的協議，在漢城舉行的美蘇關於朝鮮局勢的會議失敗以來，美國對於占領朝鮮的政策，根本就應該重新考慮。可是這一年來，由於美國的沒有行動，朝鮮的局勢，不但沒有改善，抑且日趨惡化。造成之朝鮮現在局勢的，美國卻應負起大部的責任。</p>
<p>今日而言朝鮮的局勢，我們必須認清蘇聯在朝鮮的企圖。美軍占領區司令長官霍奇將軍都公然地在說，蘇聯在其占領區內，正在訓練龐大的朝鮮軍隊，而且以中共軍隊為核心，我們要問此其目的何在？霍奇將軍的話當然不是沒有根據的：蘇聯之要在朝鮮培植這一支武裝力量為的是什麼？朝鮮與我們壤地相接，而蘇聯在朝鮮培植的這一支武裝力量卻以中共軍隊為核心，我們自不容緘默。就國家的立塲，這是對中國的一種不友好的表示：就人民的立塲，這是違反中國人民意願的一種行為。但這事卻發生在朝鮮。中國人民除表示義憤之外，更望朝鮮的美國占領軍當局能够善籌抵制之方。不行動不是政策，我們必須以行動來對付行動。否則別人的行動步步加緊，到了那個時候再要有行動，必已太晚。朝鮮南部政府的單獨成立，無疑地，是向着正當方向行進的一種合理步驟。然而行動不該限於一方面，應該是多方面的。</p>
<p>莫斯科會議是否將討論到朝鮮的局勢，我們在所不知。令人足以欣慰的是國務卿馬歇爾一昨在美京的談話，說是朝鮮問題並不在莫斯科議程內；同時，朝鮮的領袖在美又堅決反對莫斯科會議的討論到朝鮮問題。朝鮮局勢的無法改善，霍奇將軍既以表明美蘇兩軍當局就地所進行之談判，前途似極少希望；則此一問題之被提出於莫斯科，不論是在會內或會外，也似乎是一件多餘的事？朝鮮的局勢是明顯的：它之所以到這種地步，主要是由於美國的不行動。美國在戰後的世界，既負有維持和平的重責，而朝鮮的局勢，關係世界和平的維緊者，實至重要；似已不能再以不行勳為政策的了。我們願美國能負起領導世界的責任來：此不僅在朝鮮，同時亦在世界的其它地區。</p>

<h3>管制原子問題避免攤牌　美蘇爭執趨緩和　計畫將發還原子委會從長計議</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖廿五日電〕安理會木日舉行會議時，美國對安理會在國際管制原子能方面之成就備加讚揚，並預料美蘇兩國即將消除有關此點之各項異見。美代表奧斯汀聲稱：在辯論原子能問題時，足見各代表一致接受美國原子能計劃之基本原則，奧斯汀幷提議將該問題發還原子能委員會研討各項細節。奧氏指出目前仍未解決之嚴重爭執，厥為蘇聯在懲罰違約國家時不願放棄否決權之運用，但此一問題亦並未絕望。奧斯汀幷稱：「吾人目前從事於人類從未進行之偉大事業，吾人欲杜絕戰爭，本人深信吾人不致失敗，吾人且不容談判之決裂。」按奧斯汀提議將原子能計劃發還原子能委員會討論一事，其目的顯圖避免在安理會中立刻「攤牌」，蓋在安理會中如經蘇聯否決，整個原子能問題立即無從着手矣。奧氏續稱：據「推斷」所得，美國原子能計劃中數點已經各代表所接受，蓋彼等迄今尚不能反對之，上述各點如下：</p>
<p>（一）國際搜查秘密原子工程；（二）簽訂協定以廢棄原子武器及組織國際調查機構（若十代表對於蘇聯是否已在原則上同意此點，抑或仍堅持在組織國際調查機構之前應首先毀棄原子彈一節，表示懷疑）；（三）原子能在和平時間之應用屬於國際方面。奧斯汀幷列舉舉未決各點如下：</p>
<p>（一）取消五強在懲罰違反原子協定國家時之否決特權；（二）國際機構應吾管制一切原子活動，包括和平時期原子能之應用在內；（三）原子彈之與廢應否立即實行，抑依照仔細計劃之若干步驟，逐漸實行。</p>
<p>蘇聯代表葛羅米柯立即贊同將此案撥回原子能委員會，並稱：渠希望該委員會首先應專心於各項廣泛之原則，蓋廣泛原則如得協議，則其他細節即可迎刃而解。但安理會未曾舉行表決，即宣告休會。</p>
<p>正式表決手續　定星期五舉行</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖甘六最電〕聯合國方面人士稱：安全理事會定將採納美國提議，以原子報告書交回原子能委員會研究，以便使美蘇齟齬之點得到融洽。該案定星期五表決，蘇聯代表在昨日會議中旣已暗示接受美國提議，則通過自無問題。蘇聯此種態度，可使局勢緩和，因蘇聯代表葛羅米柯倘堅持安理會延長討論，終不能獲致滿意決定也。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功功廿五日電〕安全理事會本日舉行會議時，蘇聯代表葛羅米柯宣稱：原子能委員會所為己超過其權力範圍，原子能委員會並未依照聯合國大會所通過之決議草擬國際公約，禁止原子武器，故已違反聯合國　章。澳洲代表赫斯勒克當即起立反駁稱：原子能委員會全體代表本均贊成禁止原子武器之使用，但蘇聯代表堅持原子武器應先予禁止，其他代表則認為國際管制制度有先予成立之必要，因此意見紛歧，相持不下，實則原子能委員會堡完全遵照聯合國憲章而行事者云。</p>
<h3>前日本委治島嶼　蘇贊同由美託管　美託管計劃正式提出</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿五日電〕馬歇爾國務卿今日宣稱：蘇聯政府業已同意將前日本委治島嶼置於美國託管之下，渠於昨日接獲蘇聯政府之照會，聲明蘇聯政府感覺將前日本委治島嶼交美國託管，尚屬公允，良以美國在對日戰爭中，担任決定性之任務，其軍隊之犧牲，遠較他國軍隊為大之故。馬歇爾並曰，英國政府對於此事，尚未作答，渠並拒絕宣　蘇聯照會之全文，認為應由蘇政府公布之。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿六日廣播：權威方面人士稱：美代表奧斯汀要求理會通過美國受管太平洋委治島嶼之建議時，渠將提供保證，美國受管此項島嶼決為促進國際和平與安全努力。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約成功湖廿六日電〕美國今日已完成其單獨受管前日本委治島嶼之提案，並深信因蘇聯之突然改變立場，必能使聯合國加速通過其託管計劃。美國之託管計劃將由美代表奧斯汀在今日之安理會中提出。奧斯汀原擬少加遷延蓋以前蘇英兩國均要求在對日和的完成後再訂立託管計劃也。然國務院得知蘇聯改變立場後，奧斯汀亦立即改變其計劃。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿六日廣播：關於美國要求將太平洋前日本委治島嶼置於美國戰略託管下問題，在提出本日安理會辯論以前，蘇聯突然改變政策，贊成美國之要求。美方態度因此愈趨積極，擬不待對日和的之簽訂，即行解決該項島嶼之地位。美方人士相信英國與澳洲反對立刻接受美國要求，將因蘇聯贊成而打消前議。中國及法國早已聲明，除非蘇聯堅決反對，則決無異議。觀察家認為蘇聯此項讓步，是否以美國在歐洲方面作政治上讓步為交換條件，此刻尚不能加以論斷，須俟蘇聯覆文公佈後始能決定。</p>
<p>動機所在耐人尋味</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿六日電〕蘇聯贊同美國代管太平洋各島之驚人舉動，今日立即引起此間非正式之猜疑，認為蘇聯企圖討價還價，伸展其在遠東之勢力。蘇聯此項聲明，與蘇聯在朝解北部編練朝鮮軍隊之初决官方聲明巧合。據美國官方估計，此項軍隊目前殆有十二萬五千名之衆。同時，美內長葛魯裕在日作廣泛視察後，將携帶太平洋各島由文官管理之腹案返華盛頓，各該鳥即美國所要求代管者。此間美蘇關係問題專家均不欲發表意見，以待局勢繼續發展，或可判明蘇聯之動機。一部份日人認為蘇聯所由提及美國佔據各該鳥時之犧牲，欲確保其東九省境內搬出之前日本所有工業設備作籍口，蓋蘇聯早已宣揚其在東九省戰役中之「犧牲」。克魯格留此期間，對於太平洋各島之軍事價值，不欲發表意見，但會與軍界方面會談，則無疑義。此　軍人相信美國之防綫，務須環繞關島——塞班——迭尼安之弧綫，由多數前進基地，包括琉球及琉璜在內，加以保護。現代武器之速率已使珍珠港在地理上成為國內之基地，不復為前哨基地。避免珍珠港事件之再現，美國之基地務須深入西太平洋。澳洲已宣布其所關心者為澳洲勢力範圍內之各島，大的包括新幾內亞委統地與新加里杜尼亞及曼努斯羣島。</p>
<h3>澳洲外長　暢論外交</h3>
<p>〔路透社坎培拉廿六日電〕澳外長伊伐特今日在衆議院中，主張不列頑帝國諸國間，應有更密切之連絡，並採取共同行動。渠認各自治領今均已充分長成，應負担更多之責任，密切合作，積極協助聯合國機構。伊氏復謂：澳大利亞支持美國之意見，認為應先確立原子管制制度，然後始銷燬現有之原子彈，終止原子武器之製造。關於此點，澳大利亞與蘇意見不同。澳大利亞並支持美國之取得太平洋內前日本委治島嶼之管制權。澳洲復認已成立之歐洲和局尚不足以保障持久和平。澳洲復認日本之民主化為遠東和約談判之最後目標，和約應規定對日本國外貿易，國內工業及一般經濟之監督，直至聯合國機構認為日本已能自理事務時為止。澳洲並主張早日召開太平洋會議，使對日積極作戰諸國參加以解決大部份有關日本之懸題。最後渠並主張於目前設立東南亞及西太平洋區之區域機構，以負責該區內人民之利益。</p>
<h3>貝爾納斯　有任駐英大使說</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿五日電〕白宮新聞秘書羅斯對貝爾納斯將任駐英大使之說，拒不證實或否認。按華盛頓郵報今日曾批評駐英大使之遲遲未曾任命，蓋主張選任貝爾納斯担任此一要職。</p>

<h3>莫斯科會議議程　中國問題未列入　杜勒斯任馬卿顧問隨行</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿五日電〕國務院發言人本日稱：在未來之莫斯科外長會議中，並無討論中國問題之具體計劃。對中國問題之考慮，並未列入會議之議程內。但發言人稱，國務卿馬歇爾或將在會議中討論不少其他問題，包括中國問題，而此等問題則並非在會議中立即加以討論者。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿五日電〕關於美蘇兩國所有一切困難問題，頃據此間消息靈通人士談稱：國務卿馬歇爾須行抵莫斯科之後，觀察談判之情形如何，然後決定是否將此等問題提出四國外長會議加以討論。至於美蘇聞之困難問題，有下列各項：（一）朝鮮問題；（二）蘇聯橫還美國租借問題；（三）土耳其　　尼爾海峽問題；（四）裁減軍備及管制原子能問題。無論如何莫斯科會議所常討論者，當不以德國問題為限，德國與歐洲之兩係亦當討論及之。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿五日電〕美國務院今公佈出席莫斯科外長會議美代表國名單。代表團由馬歇爾國務卿率領，全體人員在八十人以上，其中半數為秘書工作人員及翻譯。代表中包括德境美軍政治顧問墨飛，及美駐奧高級專員克拉克；前總總統候選人杜威之外交顧問紐約律師杜勒斯，亦被職任為特別顧問。此外尚有政治顧問五人，經濟顧問七人，軍政府顧問四人，陸海軍顧問五人，法律顧問及助理人員。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿五日電〕國務卿馬歇爾就莫斯科會議一事發表評論稱，美國之政策仍以美國在波茨坦會議中所負之義務為基礎，並根據符合波茨坦協定之一般政策，此等政策其後由前任國務卿貝爾納斯於去年在德國斯都加特之演辭中闡明無遺。或問馬歇爾：關於租借物資結算一事，蘇聯方面　訊消息，馬歇爾　稱　。或又試及總另長莫洛托夫抗議國務　朧艾克遜失言案。馬歇爾稱，　認為此事已告結束</p>
<h3>四外次會議　昨宣告結束</h3>
<p>德和約問題提交外長會</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿五日電〕四外次會議今晨擬　討論對奧和約，當即將其所當提交四外長會議之報告書加以通過對奧和的之起草工作，於此宣告結束。該項報告　區包括四部份：一為政治條款，一為軍事條款，一為經濟條款，另一為最後條款。凡朱曾　致協議之各項條款（如防止德奧合併之保證辦法，奧境德財產及流亡人民問題等）將提交四外長會議討論。四外次並通過英代表胡特之建議。決定將報告書分送同盟各國政府存照、關於南斯拉夫代表　，要求出席莫斯科會議一事亦決定交付外長會議處</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦廿五日專電〕四議作最後決定。昨夜於五小時長時間會議中，各方意見迄未能接近。蘇代表古塞夫堅決反對於討論對德和的時，予其他較小盟國以較大之權利。最後各代表乃決定向四外長提出報告，幷由四代表個別提出建議。</p>
<h3>英蘇間爭端　貝文將向史達林　提全面解決草案</h3>
<p>〔法國新開社倫敦廿六日電〕據消息靈通人士稱：外相貝文下月出席莫斯科會議時，將向史達林提出全面解決國際重大糾紛之草案，其中包括三國締結同盟，確保德國永遠解除武裝。（二）英國與蘇聯成立單獨協定，規定任何一國均不干涉對方勢力範圍內之事件，英國之勢力範圍為近東與中東。（三）蘇聯以木材·亞麻·棉花及其他物品運往英國，英國則畀予蘇聯財政援助，此點以前從未提及，似將在莫斯科從長討論。</p>
<h3>就巴勒斯坦政局問題　貝文指責美政策</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿五日電〕外相貝文今日在下議院之巴勒斯坦辯論中，指責美國對巴勒斯坦問題增加阻撓，破壞英政府企圖使猶太族參加倫敦會議之努力，卒使該會歸於失敗。員文並謂：目前猶太人移入巴勒斯坦之數額，在猶太移民史上僅增加五倍，阿刺伯並已默認政府不能再依照一九三九年白皮書之移民限制，正當英國企圖談判協定以代替白皮書之際，杜魯門總統突於十月間發表猶太移民之聲明，乃使猶太代表拒不參加倫敦會議之談判。渠曾請美國務卿貝爾納斯勿公布杜魯門總統之聲明，然貝爾納斯則答以若杜魯門不發表，共和黨之杜威將發表之。英國之問題顯然已成美國選舉之題目。美國應知英國乃巴勒斯坦之委治國，負有一切委治國之責任。貝文並曰渠準備接受英美巴勒斯坦委員會報告書之全部建議，但美國則僅接受其中准許猶太人十萬名移入之一點。余覺基於人道之立塲，或可使阿拉伯族允許十萬猶太人之移入，然難點乃在猶太族之要求建立猶太國。阿拉伯國家對分治堅決反劉，表示若欲分治，將控英國於聯合國機構之前。在巴勒斯坦建立兩國實勢所不能。余覺阿拉伯人固不應置於猶太人統治之下，猶太人亦不應置於阿拉伯統洽之下。英國最後始決定委治之不可行，失敗之處不在巴勒斯坦之委治行政，而在國際機構之未能本於道義精神，處理此一整個問題。目前若能放棄建立猶太國之觀念，則余準備暫不向聯合國機構申訴，繼續從事嘗試云。</p>
<p>美國反響</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿五日電〕紐約民主黨議員賽勒以及親猶太報紙「紐約郵報」對於英貝文外相在下院公開指責美國均表示憤慨，白宮方面尚無反響。議會人士，對於貝文之言亦均表驚異。美國自由巴勒斯坦聯盟已上電杜魯門總統，請其向英政府嚴重抗議·紐約各晚報悉以頭號標題，刊職員文之抨擊性演辭。</p>
<h3>鄭大使歡宴　英外相貝文</h3>
<p>貝氏酒後引吭高歌</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦廿四日電〕我駐英大使鄭天錫夫婦，昨晚於大使館設宴招待英外相貝文曁夫人，餐後貝文以最愉悅之心情，高唱「國歌」。來賓中尚有巴西大使（外交團團長），蘇聯大使夫婦，曁埃及大使夫婦等。（譯者按：「　歌」為英國家傳戶曉之名曲，其時係由名詩人布恩斯所撰，名片「魂斷藍橋」，即以此為主題歌。）</p>
<h3>英埃談判僵局　埃拒絕調處</h3>
<p>〔路透社開羅廿六日電〕與埃總理諾克拉茜頗為接近之某要員告記者稱，埃及不能接受叙黎亞黎巴嫩兩國之建議調處英埃談判僵局，埃及已決定向聯合國機構申訴。</p>
<h3>最古金字塔　在開羅南郊發現</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社開羅廿五日電〕埃及之金字塔，向以李奧普斯之金字塔為最古，惟最近有法國考古學家伐利爾與埃及考古學家埃爾薩拉姆，在開羅南郊之達朱爾金字塔內考察及研究，巳獲有證據，足以證明達朱爾金字塔為埃及第四朝第一代國王史尼佛魯時所建造，視李奧普斯金字塔為古。</p>
<h3>英兩院辯論對印政策　艾德禮闡明立場　防禦責任亦將由印人擔負</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿五日電〕英首相艾德禮廿五日晚出席下議院報告印度之事，略謂：英國至一九四八年六月底將全權移交印度時，對印度之防衛責任亦同時交付印人自行負責，但印度在危急時要求英國予以援助，則此項要求之門戶仍可重開，「若印度決定願繼續為英國自治頜，則其地位將與其他自治領與英國政府之關係相同，若印度決定脫離英國，此後，吾人對印度之未來安全問題，仍極關心，英政府將準備與印度討論此事，雙方之責任及義務皆以聯合國憲章為根據。同時，議院辯論印度問題時，坦波伍特子爵稱：英國決定撤退印度之日期乃似賭徒之下注，有去無返，將使印度政府遭遇不能恢復之損失，渠稱：工黨政府對印度問題之「新政」似為無條件投降，並非一種綏靖政策。</p>
<h3>英對印決策　美表示歡迎</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿日電〕國務卿鄧歇爾今日發表聲明，在道義上支持英國宣布定期退出印度，任其完成自由獨立國家，並籲請印度各政黨團結一致。馬氏稱：印度之內爭，可能在此刻剛才開始恢復和平的世界成為國際新緊張之源泉。美國政府已明白表示關心印度在和平過渡中成立充分自治政府，並歡迎英國促成印度統一之誠意的努力。</p>
<h3>石油的國際管制　防止壟斷以謀合理分配</h3>
<p>會有人建議將全世界的石油置於聯合國管制之下，但民營石油業對此建議均竭力反對。美國國務院石油部擬設置世界管理機稱的建議，雖已有變動，但石油商相信此項建議仍有提出可能，同時大多數油商決定表示反對　執有全世界石油資源百分之五十五的美國石油業巨擘，或許能和純粹諮詢性質的國際機構合作，但石油商幾乎一致反對管制石油的世界機構，此項機構可能決定美國的石汕政策或變更其石油開採權。</p>
<p>重要性次於美國的英荷石油公司，對於石油的國際管制，一定也表示反對的。</p>
<p>英美石油協定</p>
<p>「英美石油協定」不啻是石油國際管制建議的可能的跳板，已經引起美國油商的爭辯。該項協定的根本目的在保證各國人民均可在平等競爭的原則下在國際貿易中獲得充分的石油，並保障產油國的利益。英美各派代表三人組織委員會，研究戰後石油問題，技術上的改進，石油業趨勢，及調劑肚界供求狀况等問題。</p>
<p>最後，凡產生或使用石油的其他各讓將被邀請參加此項協定，上述委員會將擴充而為國際石油委員會，僅僅是諮詢性質的。</p>
<p>美國國務院的石油專家刻在英國商討英美石油協定的履行步驟，同時並在討論一種更廣泛的計劃。此項計劃擬確立一種世界石油政策，並設置世界石油管制機構，或許受聯合國的支配。</p>
<p>世界石油政策</p>
<p>照美國務院石油專家的解說，世界石油政策的主旨為防止石油市塲的壟斷，並使小公司能參加國際市塲，使全世界所產的石油，各國均能根據平等原則合理分配。其中最大目的之一是保證和開採油田有關的各方面，包括油田所在地的人民，都能分享其利益。</p>
<p>國際石油機構</p>
<p>這世界石油機構將由若干國專家組成，或許隸屬於聯合國經濟社會委員會。它將考慮有關石油國際貿易的政治和經濟問題，研究世界各地石油開採條件，指導各國政府及石油公司採取適當措施，俾達到互惠與安定市面之目的。</p>
<p>此外，該機構有權檢討並建議油田開採權的覆查。己經獲得開採權的國家得要求該機構覆查讓受人的同意。自信不能獲得充分供給量的國家得向該機構提出申訴。</p>
<p>美國的石油商認為這一個計劃有許多危險性。他們覺得隸屬於聯合國的國際機構會給予美國國內的石油交易以種種限制。關於美國石油供應量問題，亦為一般石油商所關心。若干專家認為美國的踏勘工作不能很快的發見新油田，以代替行將告竭的油田。他們預言在十年後美國將變成一個大宗石油輸入國。他們贊成輸入石油以充實國力。</p>
<p>美石油商態度</p>
<p>但是美國石油商却堅持美國有大量的石油還沒有開採，至少有廣大的泥板岩層可以汲取石油。他們反對石油進口，深恐有控制權的國際機構會強制大量石油輸入美國。</p>
<p>在國外開採油田的公司，對於可能提出開採權覆查的任何計劃，大都表示反對。因為這些公司於探索和開發一處油田須用去巨額金錢，纔能獲得可供出售數量的石油；例如美國石油公司在委內瑞拉開採石油，在輸出一桶石油以前，曾經用去美金四千七百萬元。他們深恐國際機構對於開採油田所耗的成本和所擔的風險不肯加以適度的考慮。他們覺得在開採權發生糾葛時，與其向國際機稱申訴，母寗要求美國政府保護。</p>
<p>但是少數大企業家覺得在聯合國設置一個統制石油的國際機構是有利無弊的。假定蘇聯參加這機構，那麼蘇聯必須把有關石油交易的事實宣布出來，從而使東歐的石油問題可能得到一個解決辦法。</p>
<p>美國務院見解</p>
<p>美國務院專家的見解，認為國際機構的權力純粹是語詢性質的。但是石池商深恐一個諮詢機構會僭取統制的權力；更担心聯合國的統制機構會引起人們對於英美石油協定的反對。</p>
<p>英美石油協定的命選決定於美國參議院。該協定擱置於外交委員會將近一年，還沒有開會審查過，始則因為關於對英貸款一案美國國會尚未有何決定，趨則因為外交委員愈主席出席國際會議致使審查會議無法聞成。預料該協定在外交委員會提付審查時，贊成和反對兩派將大事活動，最後在參議院提出時更將引起激烈辯論。</p>
<p>英美石油協定是否能在參議院中通過尚不可知，但如被否決，則贊成石油國際管制者的希望不免受到嚴重的打擊。（譯自「世界報告」週刋）</p>
<h3>美國互惠貿易政策　杜魯門明令修改　維護工商業防止外貨傾銷</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿五日電〕杜魯門總統為打消共和黨議員指責其自由貿易政策起見，特於今日頒發政令，加緊維護美國利益，防止廉儂外國貨向美傾銷。總統此項敗令，係與共和黨議員范登堡及密列根協商後所發，前任國務卿赫爾所推行之互惠貿易政策，因此大受修改。惟杜魯門亦稱，赫爾於一九三四年所定原則，仍予遵循。總統政令規定：（一）所有進口貨凡足以「危害本國廠家一者須受限制。（二）與外國所訂條約，凡載有低稅率之條款，足以妨碍美國工商業者，總統有權修改，或廢止之，此項規定係范密二氏所建議。（三）任何商約須規定</p>

<h3>指數問題已獲指示　具體辦法今可公佈　市長偕社局長昨晚返滬　工人部份配給品種類可望增多</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長於前日應召晋京後，業已於昨夜十一時返抵此間。隨同晋京之社會局長吳開先，及交際科長張彼得等亦已同車返滬。據吳市長表示：渠此次晋京，純為與中稱當局商討生活指數問題，現巳商得妥善辦法，日內即可實施。吳市長係乘前夜特快車赴京，於昨晨抵京後，即往謁宋院長，商討生活指數問題。辭出後，赴主席官邸拜謁蔣主席，並與主席同進午餐。</p>
<p>又悉：關於解決生活指數問題之具體辦法，可望於今日由吳開先局長公布之。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕自經緊急措施方案公布，生活指數凍結後，上海方面工人曾推總工會水祥雲等來京請願，滬市社會局長吳開先亦專為此事來京請示。記者於廿六日晨訪社會部决長黃柏度，詢問政府對此將採何種對策，承告政府所作決定，自不能輕易更易，然當局對工人生活困難情形，當設法助其其解決。滬工人本得享受米，布，煤等三種實物供應，現彼等要求將配售種類增至與公敎人員相等（即目三種增為六種）。其數量亦要求增加至相同數目。常局對此正攷慮中，或將採取折裏辦法，增加配給種類，至數量恐將維持原數。以上係指上海等地而言，至其他指定評議物價城市之工人工資，社部正擬議「平抑工資辦法」中，蓋物價旣設法使其平抑，工資自不能任其上漲，致使工資領導物價，作循環性之上漲。此一辦法，三數日內即可擬就，俾向政院及國防委會提出。</p>
<h3>潘議長公展在京　談緊急措施方案　滬工商界提供四點盼政府採納</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕本報記者頃訪晤潘公展氏，叩以政府公佈經濟緊急措施方案後滬市工商界之情形，承談如次：該項方案公佈後，希望貫澈實施，尤盼政府與人民能配合實行，即有困難，亦應設法補教，以達成目的。至滬市一般正當工商界，則提供意見數點，亟盼政府能採擇施行：（一）該項方案，應與生產貸款同時並進，不能因噎廢食，因金鈔風潮而停止生產貸款，如只知緊縮信用，收回貸款，則實有礙生產，若為防止生產貸款流入投機之　，則可採用納爾遜戰時生產局辦法，以政府向工廠定貨之定費為貸款，如此則政府可取得物資，工商界亦可獲得貸款，資金可走向生產之途，貸款亦可換取實物，不致通貨膨脤。（二）黃金結美匯，亦即以黃金調換美匯，凡持有黃金，存入央行，即記美匯賬，各該戶即有優先申請進口貨，如機器原料等是，則黃金所調換者非法幣，自無通貨膨脹之情。且進口者均為必需品，復不致影響物價上漲。（三）加強管制金融業務部份，實際幾成專管銀行錢莊，此條例對上海市塲不盡適用，因滬市大部資金仍為游資，留在地下銀行或拆票公司，如儘量加緊管制銀行錢莊，則資金勢更流為游資。央行在滬所收各銀行準備金，存款僅四百億，此說明各銀行僅可吸收二千億存款；而滬市資金數，此不過十之一耳。故特建議合理調整利率，俾使游資流入銀行，而得以投資生產。（四）工資問題，一月份當照舊，自二月份起，生活指數仍按例公佈，惟工資可以指數比便折扣付給，手續可簡便，工人吃虧亦可較少。配給實物，工廠方面僅得三種，亦將發生糾紛，故盼政府能注意及之。</p>
<h3>四區機器業工會　招待新聞界報告</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市第四區機器製造業產業工會，昨日下午在平凉路該會招待新聞界報告，希望政府恢復生活指數給薪。或有效的使物價恢復一月份指數。如於下月五日前不能得到圓滿答復決即聯合全滬各業工會大請願。</p>
<h3>以物易物　東北經濟會　函市府採納</h3>
<p>東北經濟委員會，頃函滬市府，略稱：經濟緊急措施方案頒行後，各地物價，均由主管機關，自行核定，各地情形不同，價格難免參差。東北出產大豆，豆餅，內地需要殷切，旦價格低於內地，而其他民生必需品，如布疋，棉紗，麵粉，糖，茶之類，價格均高於內地，若無適當辦法，物資難免流入囤積居奇者之手，市民及農民，均難得其實惠。如有上項物品，運來東北，以物易物，當由該會隨時作價辦理。市府接信後，已函社會局辦理。</p>
<h3>對穩定物價促進生產　工協滬分會提供意見</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全國工業協會上海分會，昨晚招待新聞界，首由理事長胡伯翔報告，略謂政府此次採取緊急措施辦法，意欲抑平物價，工業界對於抑平物價事最表關切，惟欲抑平製成品之價格，首應注重原料與工資，原料方面，工業界方面希望能直接申請外匯，直接定購外貨，而不經進口商人之轉手與剝削。工資方面，則工業界以為在實物配給辦法確實施行以前，生活指數辦法應繼續維持，否則難免繼續引起工潮事件。總幹事田和卿報告，略謂政府緊急措施辦法，意欲抑平物價，而取締金鈔買賣，實為捨本逐末之方法，意欲穩定工資，而凍結生活指數，更屬掩耳盜鈴，如政府確欲抑平物價，安定民生，實應注意如何促進生產，欲促進生產，則下列各點必須有以解決：（一）工廠之資金—欲國內遊資趨向生產事業，必須取締高利貸，其方法為取締地下錢莊。（二）由國家銀行以低利貸款與民豐銀行，再由民營銀行貸與從事生產之工廠，其總量應較生產貸款為巨大，手續應簡便。（三）原料—政府應以平價原料配與民營工廠，不應僅限於國營工廠。（四）工資—生活指數原非為工資而定，然在目前情形下，尚不失為發給工資之一種參攷，且實物配給制，實妨害薪水階級運用薪金之自由，而手續又極繁，故應請政府仍按月頒佈生活指數，工廠方面或採生活指數制，或採實物配給剷，聽其自便。再不然，政府可規定各地最低工資數字，以便遵行。（五）市塲—現在國外市塲等於凍結，如再無適當辦法，則關外市塲，將為日本所獨佔。（六）各廠　備—目前各工廠之設備，皆陳舊不堪，但以上諸問題不能解決，則工廠實無力改善設備。</p>
<p>該會曾於二月十九日召開會員大會，通過穩定物價，促進生產等辦法，向政府建議，希望政府能採納工業界方面之意見，以謀整個生產事業之發展。</p>

<p>研究原因再查央行</p>
<p>另悉，經濟監察團初成立時曾研究造成此次金潮之原因，除年終大量年賞獎金之流通市面，生產貸款之兼放等原因外，中央銀行之停止暗拋，亦為促使金價上漲之重要因素，故對於負平抑金價之中央銀行，在此次風潮中之處置是否得當，亦為經監團調查目標之一。金鈔組長徐幼祚昨曾會同監察委員何漢文等，再赴中央銀行審核帳册，此外並派員調查各銀行之保管箱。</p>

<h3>沈嗣良三度受審　辯護律師提出反證　「會外名流」四字於被告有利</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前聖的翰大學校長沈嗣良，被控漢奸嫌疑案，昨在高院三度審訊，該校教授學生擁集刑二庭旁聽，座無隙地，後至者佇立聆聽。沈年五十二歲，寗波人，髮已花白，身着灰色呢大衣，花圍巾，閱看文件時帶上眼鏡，答辯時則將眼鏡卸下，態度頗為安詳鎭靜。</p>
<p>沈嗣良供稱：軍統局覆函中所提供之證據，均係從當時偽報中摘錄者，事實上並無其事。唯因彼時處於日人統治之下，無從聲辯。反英美協會我根本沒有參加過，如何能做理事？登台演說，更絕無其事。偽上海市體育協會理事長一職，因我在體育界有二十餘年之歷史經體育界公推担任，該會中外球隊俱有，從未向外募款，與丁默邨毫無關係。敵重光大使及在逆精衛之兩次邀案，被告均未參加。偽新國民運動促進委員會根本沒有參加，偽中日文化協會上海分會常務理事是陳公博把我名字放進去，沒有徵求我的同意。偽上海市民節的運動委員會，根本就不知道牠的意義，不要說是參加組織。偽上海市政府諮詢委員會諮詢委員，被告曾經祖任過，那不過是代表民衆說話的民意機關。該會裏並無「教育委員會」的名稱，更不是召集人。偽上海市民福利協會，我旣不是委員，也不是發起人。末稱：淪陷時期之「申報」年鑑與新中國手册，均係陳彬龢主持，其中材料，根本靠不住。</p>
<p>嗣由辯護律師洪士豪提出一項有力證據，為三十二年一月二十六日之「申報」，內容為反英美協會勸募貸學金，請「會外」名流沈嗣良等講演。洪律師強調稱：「旣稱『會外名流』，可知被告未任該會理事，此實為一有力之反證」。繼由宓錫通律師起立辯濩，請求交保，並允接見家屬</p>

<h3>讀者諮詢　法律質疑</h3>
<p>（一）珠胎暗結</p>
<p>金三問　茲有法律疑問數則，乞予解答：（一）甲女（十九歲）與乙男（二十二歲）訂婚後受乙誘惑，珠胎暗結，復遭乙遺棄，乙在法律上犯何種罪行？甲可否請求贍養？（二）甲擬與乙解的，但乙避不見面，與乙父交涉，惟說己與其子脫離關係，不知應用何法進行？（三）甲在未辦屏約手續前與丙同居，是否犯通姦罪？</p>
<p>〔傅况鱗律師答〕（一）乙誘姦其未婚妻甲，按其情節，亦可構成刑法上之妨害風化，妨害冢庭，或妨害自由罪。現乙不顧甲，如甲尚未成為乙之家屬，或無撫養之特約，則乙不成立遺棄罪，但甲可請求賠償損害，而非請求瞻養。（二）乙旣已成年，有獨立行為能力，自不能對其父交涉起訴時如乙所在不明，關於請求解除婚的之訴，可聲請法院公示送達。（三）甲尚未與乙結婚，不能即認為有配偶，如在未解約前與丙同居，不構成刑法第二百三十九條之通姦罪，乙方自無告訴權，但乙可根據民法第九百七十六條第一項第七款之規定解除婚約。</p>
<p>（二）移愛他人</p>
<p>王學俊問某甲已娶有妻室，現復與其同學乙女士相戀，且已發生肉體關係。今甲乙願互偕白頭，請問甲乙此種行為對於法律有吾抵觸之處？（二）乙女能否與其家庭脫離關係，而與某甲結婚？</p>
<p>〔傅況鱗律師答〕（一）田有配偶與乙通姦構成刑法第二百三十九條之罪，惟非配偶，不得告訴，尚甲與乙正式結婚，更犯重婚罪，非告訴乃論。（二）如乙為已滿二十歲之成年人，無須脫離家庭，家長對其行為不能干涉。</p>

<h3>司徒大使在廣州　向學生發表演辭　認中國需要受過各種訓練的學生</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處廣州廿五日電〕司徒雷登今日在此間，向大學生與中學生，發表演辭如次：「廣州已從侵略者的魔掌中解放出來，再度剩起，成為歷史性的，商業團際接觸和政治革新運動的中心，我此次能舊地重遊，衷心至感欣慰，實非言詞所能表違。革命運動的往事，一幕又一幕地在我的心中浮起，尤其是那些和國父有關的革命運動，因為我們現正聚集在這個總理紀念堂中。面對着中國學生，我也深切感動，因為諸位都代表着極大的潛力。</p>
<p>抗戰勝利　歸功學生</p>
<p>記得一九一九年五月四日學生抗日運動發生時，我就開始寄居北平，後來，無論我在北平或其他地方，我都和學生密切合作，他們都富有愛國熱誠，喚起國人共同抵抗外來威脅。我認為中國人民不顧艱苦，損失，災患，和死亡，走上抗日大道，大都由於這些學生運動所喚起的民族自覺，遂使先賢孟子「先知覺後知，先覺覺後覺」之敎誨，實現於今日。為了中國在初期四年內，能從事抵抗，珍珠港事奱發生以後四年，就終於獲得勝利，因此，勝利的獲得，大部應歸功中國學生。</p>
<p>今後活動　着重建設</p>
<p>為此，關於我認為目前中國學生能在有用的活動中，表示同樣的愛國熱誠的途徑，我願坦白地向諸位宣示我心目中的意見，因為我深信今日學生的愛國熱誠，當不下往昔抵抗外來侵略時的學生。目前中國的問題，是內在的，我認為今後一切活動應着重建設的，而非破壤性的工作。前此針對滿淸，日本，或其他一切危機的革命運動，都曾有破壞性的鼓動，這是無可避免的事。然而我認為推翻，抵抗，破壤，或從事其他種種消極鼓動的時代，現已過去。由於我目擊種種城廓為墟民生疾苦的破壤，我愈益覺察到幽結從事建設性工作之重要。</p>
<p>未來公民　需要訓練</p>
<p>在最近的將來，中國需要受過各種訓練的學生，（包括實用科學，社會或政府活動，以及其他有用的公衆服務），所以，諸位要用功攻讀，而且須要記住：你們目前所受的訓練，應該適合那種可使你們儘量發揮愛國目標的特殊事業。同時，你們可以時常想着國家問題。我堅決相信，學生應該對目前政治發生興趣，你們將成為朱來的公民；除非公民積極的參加政府，決不會有良好的民主政府，新的憲法允許你們言論，新聞，與集會的自由。你們活在一個很重要的時代：第一，在你們國家悠久的歷史中，眞正的民主政府正在積極計劃中。以美國人的立塲，對於中國這種有希望的發展，當然感覺很深切的興趣。用美國獨立宣言的字句來講「這是一個獲得人民允許的政府」，這也就是引導我國筵生的不朽名言。在這種觀念後面，有着一種哲學，那就是任何政府或社會方面的變更，無論其如何必要與迫切，如果曾得到那些與之有關的人的同意，其結果總是很有效很完滿而且破壤性較小的。換言之，社會或政府方面之變遷，是由敎化促成的，而非由於武力或獨裁。誠如孟子所言：「以力服人者，非心服也，以德服人者，衷心悅而誠服也。」</p>
<p>普及敎育　英明領導</p>
<p>民主政府，需要普及的敎育與英明的領導。最重要者，它需要那些摒棄私念以服務國人為前提的領袖和公民。諸位於孕育這些崇高理想和推已及人地將這些原則分惠與同胞時，我認為諸位將獲得一種表達諸位愛國熱誠的方法，其效果將遠過於那種錯亂的革命鼓動方法，且能適應目前國人的需求。</p>

<p>廣設獎學金額　補助邊疆敎育</p>
<p>（四）根據「各級政府廣設獎學金額，以扶助學行俱優無力升學之學生」之規定，小學畢業生學行俱優者的佔百分之十五應得升學獎學金，此項獎學金應由縣市政府担負。各縣市應如何嚴密選取應得獎金之學生，並規定辦法，籌揹經費？（五）根據「邊遠及貧瘠地區之敎育文化經費由國庫補助」之規定，各邊遠貧瘠省區國民敎育發展之現狀如何，計劃如何，需要國庫補助年的若干？（六）根據「敎育科學文化之經費，在中央不得少於其總預算百分之十五，在省不得少於百分之二十五，在縣不得少於百分之三十五」之規定，省之敎育經費中國民敎育經費，應約佔百分比幾何，各省應如何以有效辦法，促成市縣敎育經費至少達百分之三十五，已達到此至少限度之比例者應如何分年增加，再各縣敎育經費如達到至少定額是否敷用？（七）根據「依法設置之敎育文化基金及產業應予以保障」之規定，現有國民學校基金，及地方敎育產業，應如何規定具體辦法，予以保障？（八）根據「國家應保障敎育科學藝術者之生活，並依國民經濟之進展隨時提高其待遇」之規定，各省市縣國民學校敎員之生活，應如何使之安定，予以保障，並如何提高其待遇，為保障生活提高待遇，需要如何規定具體辦法，並籌措經費？（九）根據憲法第一六七條之規定，關於國民敎育方面如何規定具體辦法，獎勵久於其職而成績優良之不學敎員，（包括僑民小學敎員），如何規定具體辦法，獎勵私立小學。</p>

<h3>沈亦珍等向市敎局建議　加強國敎示範區　就實騐所得擬具四項辦法</h3>
<p>上海市第二國民敎育示範區主任沈亦珍，副主任盛朗西，具呈市敎育局，建議加强國敎示範區具體辦法四項如次：（一）提高國敎示範區辦事處之職權，國敎示範區辦事處為本市敎育局之附為機關。負有本市國敎示範之使命，如欲完成此使命，必須提高其職權，以利推動，設或與中心國民學校並行其職，則推動力量無形削弱，進行工作何能順利，為增加推動力量計，可吾規定「國敎示範區辦事處」，有督導所屬各校，及更動人事等權力，期以行政力量，健全區校機構，發揮示範功能。（二）劃淸示範區辦事處，與中心國民學校之輔導任務：國敎示範區之工作重心，在輔導研究，而其任務即在輔導所屬學校，與中心國民學校相同，如是雙方並行輔導，則責無專指，且多抵觸，在被輔導者，則應接不暇，疲於奔波，結果反勞而無功，為增加輔導效率計，可否規定區內學校由辦事處直接輔導，區外學校由中心國民學校担任輔導。（三）提高中心國民學校校長敎員資歷水準，並增加其待遇，中心國民學校，為全區國民學校之表率，國敎示範區內之中心國民學校，所居地位更為重要。是以中心國民學校校長敎員之資歷水準，實有提高之必要，否則何以統率全區學校，而盡其輔導硏究之職。為充實中心國民學校內容計，可吾規定中心國民學校校長，須有師範專科學校，或大學敎育系畢業之資格，中心國民學校敎員，須在高中師範科或師範專門學校畢業，並充任小學敎員二年以上有成績者，底薪按其齊歷予以提高，相當於中學敎師之待遇，以便羅致人才。（四）國敎示範區經常事業費，改由敎育局直接發放：本市敎育經費具領手續，非常複雜，旣無定時，又費時日，而事業費必須經使用後，由第三者直接向市銀行收款，其手續尤為麻煩，影細於事業進行者至巨。查此項辦法之趨定，容或有相當原因，然應用於一般之辦法，未必適用於敎育事萊。為便利敎育事業進行計，可吾將國敎示範區經常事業費，改由市敎育局直接發放，以簡領款手續，而利事業進行。以上四端，為本區同人半年來工作上實騐所得，倘蒙採納施行，或能收效於來茲，是否有當，敬乞核。</p>

<h3>香島球報　特另銀牌複賽　星島戰和英軍　本季第一場精彩戰</h3>
<p>〔本報香港航訊〕特別銀牌賽，今年重分甲乙組舉行，經過幾週來的淘汰惡戰，形勢已吿分曉。</p>
<p>今年港地外隊實力不够勁；甲組只有金冕多，四五營打入準決賽週，乙組也只有一隊海軍乙能得準決賽權，華隊星島甲乙，南華甲乙同列虎榜，光華會也全力擊退海軍甲，參加準決賽。</p>
<p>按秩序—週六（二月廿二號）</p>
<p>星島乙對海軍乙；二時一刻——南華球塲</p>
<p>星鳥田對四五營；四時正——南華球塲</p>
<p>週末（二月廿三號）</p>
<p>南華乙對警察；二時一刻——香港會塲</p>
<p>南華甲對光華；四時正——香港會塲</p>
<p>乙組登場未分勝負</p>
<p>今日（週六）星島兄弟先出師在南華球塲迎戰番兵，未滿二時，嘉山道上，萬頭攢動，爭着兩幕華洋劇戰。</p>
<p>二時一刻，乙組先上塲，星島乙逢海軍乙，前者是聯賽無敵盟主，後者也是乙組勁旅，這番相逢，是淘汰戰，誰都想奪得決賽權。</p>
<p>經過九十分鐘的大戰，前半時星乙以二比一先勝，後半時却負一比二，結果三比三被洋水兵迫和。加時再賽，也各無所得，只好定期再決戰。全塲打來緊扣，不弱於任何甲組戰事，確是一塲好球。</p>
<p>神腿傷足影響前鋒</p>
<p>乙組賽罷，甲組出戰，金兵四五營，行將解甲歸國，在臨別之前，實欲擊敗星島為榮，故大戰前文，苦練三星期，賽來頭頭是道，幾使星島無法應付，全隊有超水準演出，迫和星島，幷非倖運。</p>
<p>反觀星島，自該隊靈魂「神腿」馮景祥足傷後，前鋒推進，不如前時靈活，今日之戰，守衛已盡最大努力，能保不敗，無話可說，只差鋒綫演出未如理想，不能取勝。</p>
<p>這一塲，也是加時再赛，全賽程一百十分鐘，精采百出，是本季內第一場劇戰。</p>
<p>戰情在球證登士圖銀笛中展開，但見雙方列陣如下：</p>
<p>（星島會）</p>
<p>余耀德　譚江栢　侯榕生　馮坤勝　許竟成　吳祺祥　曹秋亭　黎兆榮　張金海　劉松生　何應芬</p>
<p>（四五營）</p>
<p>泰來</p>
<p>地亞力吿辰　般力芝　巴頓　堪布路</p>
<p>活定　連路士　高路托　的葛　尼路</p>
<p>一經接觸，星島即閃電進擊，無功而還。如是雙方在互有攻守中，混戰達二十分鐘。二十三分鐘時，始見應芬得球，從右路疾進，見一脚傳中，金兵兩後術誤會無人衝門，不防兆榮閃進，一脚踢去，惜扣來無力，虛此一衝？</p>
<p>接着金海得中塲傳來妙球，帶球直進，敵衛雖在後窮追，但見「三郎」奔至門前，將球踏定，廻身將球撥入網內，「妙」！一比零，星島佔先，前半時就以這球定勝負。</p>
<p>小休過後，換塲再戰，四五營全師出擊，不兩分鐘，祺祥在禁區救球，被判犯規，十二碼球，地亞主踢，耀德雖拍出，地亞也機警，衝前再加一脚，耀德未能翻身搶救，一比一，初度平手。</p>
<p>兆榮一脚再度領前</p>
<p>中綫再開，說時遲，那時快，星島三鋒已殺到番兵門前，松生强越地亞射門，泰來拍出，兆榮恰巧趕到，加上一脚，二比一，再度領前。</p>
<p>此後雙方陷入苦戰，番兵全力反攻，計射門中柱亦有三决，到四十二分鐘時，看看時間將完，不防番兵在圍攻中，力吿辰在二十五碼外得球，冷射一記，球低而急，繼德撲救不及，二比二，再成和局。</p>
<p>暮色沉沉握手言和</p>
<p>加時再賽，雙方幷不稍露疲態，還是死攻，星島有二次近門射高，而最險的，却是在最後一秒鐘，地亞射門，中柱彈出，星島險敗。</p>
<p>結果各無建樹，在暮色沉沉中，握手言和，這一來，誰得決賽權，有待再決戰。</p>
<p>足球總會提前重賽</p>
<p>〔本報香港航訊〕前週六——廿二日，特別銀牌準決賽，星島甲乙同被迫和，此間足球總會，於前日——廿三日開比賽委員會，出席有主席黃家駿，李惠堂，史堅拿，羅渣士，葉九臯等，決議將此未了球賽，提前舉行：計</p>
<p>屋島甲戰四五營——週三（廿六日）四時舉行</p>
<p>星島乙戰海軍乙——週四（廿七日）四時舉行</p>
<p>此種處置，全為四五營着想，因四五營行將歸國，故不惜一切，提前舉行。</p>
<p>刻星島以前週出戰時，甲乙組戰將，均有受傷，不能混隊出戰，經去函總會請求改期。</p>
<p>且如廿六號戰四五營，三月一號又備戰南華，——奪聯賽冠軍，在一週內，連應付三塲重要比賽，實無法應付，故總會若不改期，則到時究能派多少球員上陣，未能定奪，此事尙待解決。</p>

<h3>輸入管委會發言人談　限額分配之根據　國內生產及外滙資源兼籌並顧</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸入管理委員會某發言人，昨為外界批評該會分配各種輸入品之限額問題，特發表聲明如次，渠稱：本會對各種限額之分配，首以根據國內需要之情形為原則。如該項輪入品，確屬需要，則再調查國內是否有同樣之替代品。有則儘量利用國內替代品，無則再考慮准許輪人。再次復須願到國家之外匯資源問題，以能省即省為原則。果不能省，則亦須分別隊入品性質之迫急程度，然後核給外滙。不久以前所發表本年二月至四月問廿二種輸人品之限額，大多係根據各該項輸入品戰前三年平均輸入之價値而決定。數字來源，多係採自海關歷年精確之統計，決非憑空所能虛構。外界對若干種輸入品之限額，或認為太寬。例如對菸草一項，認為可减少半數，或謂國內產量，足敷消費。查該項指　，均乏事實佐證。他如藥品，水泥，食糖，及汽車四項輸入品，在本年二月至四月間之輸入限額中暫予停止。此綠該項輪人品，或以存量充足，或以有替代品可用關係，在三個月內，決不致發生供應之困難，故暫予停止輪入云。</p>
<h3>輸廣會四次會議　決成立猪鬃小組　梧州出口貨應審核結匯證</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸出推廣委員會執行委員會，於昨日上午十時在央行舉行第四次會議。除金錫志因公赴京外，其他各委員均到，貝祖飴主席。重要之決定如下：（一）成立猪鬃小組，人選如下：沈熙瑞（召集人），龔善百，王仰先，陸生田，忻禮　，曾澤涵，安子介（兼秘書）。（二）決定由梧州出口貨物之結匯出口辦法。此事經上决執行委員會議定，並呈奉政院核准，即日通知指定經理外匯之銀行及梧州海關，所有經由梧州輸出應予結匯之各種貨物（尤以桐油為然），加以嚴格審核，必須具備指定銀行簽發之結購外匯證明書，方准報關出口。</p>
<h3>政府機關購外貨　應先申請許可　不得事後補辦手續</h3>
<p>行政院以修正進出口貿易暫行辦法，業經公布施行，嗣後凡政府機關向國外輸入物資器材，須於訂的以前，依照該辦法之規定，申請許可，不得於購運之後，補辦手續，特分令各有關機關轉飭遵照，茲悉市政府已接奉此項訓令，並已令進出口業公會遵照辦理云。</p>
<h3>統債續跌</h3>
<p>公債昨仍見不振，統丙晨開六九〇〇元，五五〇室五四四室雖納，三六〇室五五二室則出，自七〇〇〇元盤低至五七五〇元，最後在六〇〇〇元關外徘徊，結果較前收計甲乙戊各跌五〇〇元，丁降三〇〇元，統丙跌落七〇〇元，成交的四百餘萬元。</p>
<h3>外股升降不一</h3>
<p>外股昨極為平和，各股升降不一，過程恍惚，結果較前收計恰紗英聯微升。航業會德豐平平，餘者　挫迄半成强不等。</p>
<h3>洋莊茶市堅穩</h3>
<p>滬東洋莊市，脫手重順利及售價最堅穩者，當推抽珍·珍眉。等花色。擯持多日之祁門紅茶，因供求兩寂，交易不振，但聞刻下英商仁記洋行尚有三十八箱卅四年度陳中祁門，正在向貨主作積極談判中，價格方面，亦將接近，不久即有獲得成交之希望。蘇州帮頻加靑睞之茉莉雙　，以賣戶呌價堅持不鬆，難見活發。</p>
<h3>匯率調整以後　對日易貨有利</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕有關方面消息：本年度中日易貨之價値總額，主管機關希望能達六千萬美元之數。我國有需於日本之貨物，近三十種；日本盼望我國供應者，亦相彷彿，以日本與各國易貨額比較，美國最高，其次為英國，我國則因不能以日太最渴望之糧食輸出，故位列英國之後。最近匯率調整後，對易貨相當有利。關於日本窰木之供給，我方希望至少能有七八百萬根，但日方只允供給四百萬根，聞我方最近對此有新建議提出。至於日本要求我國供給大豆一節，聞經濟當局認為大豆為我國之重要出口物資，一如日本之棉紡織品，必須用以易取外匯，不能包括在易貨範圍內。</p>
<h3>錢兌業改營存放　須待財部決定</h3>
<p>央行總裁允代洽商</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕錢兌業公會理事長任雲程，常務理事李蘭生·劉錫臣等，於昨日下午三時許，往謁中央銀行貝總裁，當承延見。汪氏等申述該業諧求兼營小額存放款業務等要求後，貝氏允代為向財部洽商，然後再行決定可否。又關係該業職工考取央行發行局點鈔生者，央行亦允在部署妥帖後，即行僱用服務。</p>
<h3>華股成交冷落　多方無意支持</h3>
<p>華股昨成交冷落，多方迫於掉期，無意支持，形成供過於求，午後曾現不利，水泥新光勤興退至跌停，後受利買傳說，疲後轉穩。</p>
<p>晨開現交九福新華漲停，　交微升，開後隔夜浮多，鑒於戰事據大，咸加了結，即吿不支，七八號一七一號一〇六號賣到二三〇〇元，八四號一一二號八九號一九八號趁低微納，遞永紗升為二三六〇元，一九八號一四五號二二四號仍賣，二一九號一七九號九七號二〇六號等均售，終將遞永紗迫低至二二一〇元，二二號七六號維持，一四五號尚售而多盤，延至十一時後，一四號一二號一九二號來進，遞永紗曾回升至二二九〇元，二二四號二三一號一五五號一〇二號二二二號賣出，十一時半後，又形不支，中法首先跌停，一二九號一七九號四七號二二三號以及散多咸斬，午收逐呈低價同，九福亦吿跌停，現永紗以最後成交計，反高於遞永紗，結果較前收計永紗景福華　跌半成光景，美亞信和勤興新光各跌一成左右，新華漲停，中法跌成半強，遞交永紗美亞華豐跌一成弱，信和新光各跌一成强，冷股火柴漲後亦回，結果亦升，麗安僅　一筆交易尚平，九福跌成半强，餘者自微挫迄一成不等。</p>
<p>午後祇做即交，上場續疲，三〇號九一號一五一號一四五號一五二號二一一號均售，水泥首先跌停，新光勤興亦跌停有成交，現永紗曾退至二〇八〇元，一七九號一四五號八五號二一八號八三號趁低維持，傳政府全面改組說，疲後轉定，美亞在增資一贈十之利買傳說下，掀動漲風，人心被激，形勢轉好，一四五號八四號二三二號一九九號一五二號一七一號連袂購納，現永紗回升至二二〇〇元，九七號一〇六號二二三號一四五號忽有脫手，退至二一六〇元，四號二二號一八〇號一四五號一五二號再進，而回升至二二六〇元，火柴迫近漲限，美亞亦相離不遠，後以二〇三號一八三號一七七號脫手，臨收小回，結果較前收計永紗信和跌半成，中法華豐量福勸興小挫，新光降一成弱，美亞漲成半弱，新華漲停，冷股火柴漲停，水泥曾跌停，榮豐中紡跌半成左右，九福新亞跌一成，餘升降不一，遞交祇上午半天交易，計永紗美亞華豐跌一成弱，信和新光跌一成强，場外各股見挫。</p>
<h3>茶樣送檢評價　日期已規定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕出口茶葉第三次評價委員會於昨日舉行，對標準茶樣及給分際準已有決定。現限茶商於下星期一前，將出口茶樣送至央行，以便彙集給分，評定價格。據有關人員表示：中信周之評價工作，乃完全在技術上為央行及茶商服務。在過去茶商要求政府收購時，央行將虧本甚大，今匯率調整後，已無此項顧慮。目前世界之茶葉市塲與我不利，日茶英茶均以低價與我競爭，故出口茶如定價太高，將使華茶處於不利之地位。</p>
<h3>大批麵粉到滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊）怡和公司代理之希臘輪巴巴乞利特迪斯凡西立斯　（　音），昨日抵滬，由滬　　運來麵粉七千餘噸，計二十三萬五千五百餘包，係中信局所採　。該輸泊六號七號浮筒，過駁起卸。又矮愛別斯號輪，由亞力山大埠運來棉花一千一百件，亦於昨日抵滬，現靠浦東其昌棧起卸。</p>
<h3>出口業企圖挽回頹勢　決定組織請願團　並籌組進口連鎖制委員會</h3>
<p>本市出口業為發展輸出，挽救危機起見，昨日下午三時假銀行公會俱樂部召開臨時重要座談會，到有出口各業代表五十餘人，公推馬仲達為臨時主席，報吿開會之要旨，痛陳當前出口業經營艱苦現狀，並指出在現時幣制未能穩定下，提高外匯，實不易使出口貿易發展，希望同業共商補救辦法，繼由到會者相繼發表意見，最後決定要案如下：</p>
<p>推定請願代表</p>
<p>（一）為向當局解釋出口實際困雖，並提供今後推廣出口業務之意見，決組織請願團，推定顧文生，張貽志，邱良榮，馬仲達，陸伯偉，武立侯，錢培榮，宋乘倫，葉序馨，兪國堯，龔善古等十一人為請願代表，準備先向輸出推廣委員會及中央銀行業務局請願。</p>
<p>研究進出連鎖</p>
<p>（二）為硏討發展出口有效辦法，籌備組織進口連鎖制硏究委員會，推定邱良榮，馬仲達，張貽志，顧文生，陸伯偉，武立侯，錢培榮，宋秉倫，葉序馨，俞國堯，龔善百，章乃器，賀鄴侯，方生由等為委員。</p>
<p>請改結匯限期</p>
<p>（一）中央銀行最近規定出口結匯之期限九十天，頗予出口商有絕對不利之點，決呈函最高經濟委員會，經濟部輸出推廣委員會，轉請中央銀行予以考盧變更。</p>
<h3>細布喊價步昂</h3>
<p>昨日棉布市况因速日下跌甚鉅，而紡建公司前日供售之五福細布，較市貨每疋反高五千元，致人心轉俏，場中徵有收吸，喊價堅昂。十二磅龍頭細布開價十三萬元，步高至十四萬二千五百元。五福由十三萬七千元高至十四萬元，較之前市軋升三五千元不一。其他各牌細布亦見回升一二千元。色布及士林布元嗶嘰等，則鮮波動。</p>
<h3>紡建照市供售　紗價繼續疲跌</h3>
<p>昨日紗市仍在瘟境盤旋，客銷有如石沈大海，迄無動辦現象，紡建復有大批民營紗照市供售，致人心益難轉佳，二十支紗又降三五萬，四十二支小十萬至十五萬元。</p>
<p>又訊，中國紡建公司昨日循例代紡管會售紗，共售四六三件，內廠商二四五件，紗號二一八件。申請戶數共九九戶，內廠商五九戶，紗號四零戶。</p>
<h3>食鹽引岸制廢除</h3>
<p>我國際政營理，過去一向採用引岸制度。此種制度主要特點，在於使　銷有一定區域限制，其定區內，某承銷之鹽商，有其事利權及抑平鹽荒之責任，越界為私，照　苛罰，抗數爆發後，各地鹽商相　逃亡，此種制度，無形中即為砲火所摧毀，旋鹽政當局，於頒布實行鹽專買制度時，亦　明令廢除引岸制，惟時日久遠，被人忽略，或日久玩生，加以專買辦法已經變更，故最近立法院予以正式通過，廢除引岸制，以期重申前令，以促成食鹽自由貿易制之發展云。</p>
<h3>米糧價堅定　雜糧一致疲軟</h3>
<p>昨滬南閘北米市共到一萬一千七百餘石，粳米南市堅定之勢，北市胃呆少神，中决見疲。白元陰元均無出入，秈米亦少上落。麵粉形勢平庸，鮮有變化。麩皮銷路不振，績跌千餘元。</p>
<p>油市早緊午懈，亦少榮辱。豆餅實消仍淡，頻頻下降，再跌千元。</p>
<p>雜糧一致相　挫落，紅糧交易淸元懈，續疲千元。苞米酒精略動，價格疲軟。生仁南洋轉呆，止漲轉跌，回小五六千元。緣豆平平，芝蔴彷彿。黃豆外埠去化不動，傳聞中信局又將大豆配售，致人心虛軟，連跌二三千元。</p>
<h3>配油零信價　尚在商洽中</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海食油聯配處，昨日配售浦東區各食油零售店食油八九七担，今日將配市中心區。配價每担為二十五萬元。至零售店之門售價，尚待與市政當局洽商，是否可豁免營業稅問題，然後再予決定云。</p>
<h3>腸衣新價開出</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕豬　以開價太高，如收購輸出，價與國外市價相彷，故買氣呆濃，交易毫無，腸衣今日開出新價每桶（一二五零副）為六百萬元，亦與國外市價相若。</p>
<h3>花邊剌品　外價均下跌</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據本市瑞商某洋行告記者稱：外匯提高以後，國外對於花邊·合毯·　刺品·洋枕·鈕扣·草帽·等，均已下跌二成至四成，滬市市價陡漲，已超過國外最近行市，故輸出反遇困難。</p>
<h3>汽車保険費　下月起加一倍</h3>
<p>本市汽車保險業鑒於最近汽車材料激漲，保險賠償費用數目增大，乃於昨日召開臨時會議，商討調整保險率，經全體決議，自下月起，將保險費量低限額七萬五千元提至十五萬元，即將保險率增加一倍云。</p>
<h3>鐵價挫落二成</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕生鐵今市每噸四五C萬元，因內地運來頗多，市況呈軟，買氣義　，較最高峯時已下跌二成。熟鐵，洋板鐵·三角鐵等，價亦下挫一成至二成不等。</p>
<h3>燒碱市價挫跌</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕燒碱近日自廣州方面運來甚多？一部份係定貨到埠，到貨絡繹，一時尚不能吿一段落。滬市實銷轉淡，且以自產液體燒碱，用途旣無差別，市價較固體亦低三成，故紛紛採用液體燒碱。上內門燒碱昨市做價每桶為四百五十萬元，美貨四百卅萬元，成交廖寥。</p>
<h3>配貨時斷時續　人造絲繼續高漲　生絲外銷雖動價難好轉</h3>
<p>人造絲終因配售貨時斷時續，且實銷戶吸胃甚濃，故昨市繼續高漲，一二〇號高山有光上午開盤七百八十萬元即有成交，後復盤旋上升，做到八百十萬元收盤，下午更好，三十萬元有成交，最後喊價仍為三十萬三元，七五號半光喊到一千一百五十萬元，物稀為貴，駭人聽聞。廠經昨市仍形靜寂，C字等級洋行略有交易，做價八百十五萬元，比上日喊價稍大，其餘只有另担有幾担做開，價與上日相同。綢貨因實銷淸淡，欲漲無力，眞絲貨反見疲弱，人造絲貨雖原料高昂，但乏人過問，故亦堅持。</p>
<p>又訊，連日生絲市場，英印商洋行頗有吸胃，但因美國生絲市場價步下挫，A級每磅為美元五元五角，故開價仍難好轉，瑞商連納洋行做開D級廿分廿條紋三十担，每担價為七百入十萬元，達昌洋行做開C級廿分廿二條紋十祖，每担價為八百萬元，怡和洋行做開D級廿分廿二條紋四十擔，每担價七百八十五萬元，據業中人謂：雖外銷已動，惟價格仍難好轉。</p>
<h3>飢餓的世界　國際糧食情況展望</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室特譯稿（續）</p>
<p>一九四六年的糧食生產量雖較上年增加，但世界糧食恐慌並未稍减。據官方估計，一九四六年七月一日起，至一九四七年六月三十日止的年度中，糧食生產總額較上年度增加百分之七，或許能和戰前的平均產量相等。但自從一九三九年以來，世界人口增加了百分之七，這就是說等於戰前的生產量是不够的。照人口比例計算，一九四六年冬季的糧食供應，約較戰前减少百分之五。</p>
<p>饑饉的各國所最需要的五穀，其產量還沒有豐盛到使歐洲能結束麵包的配給制。歐洲各國倘能輪入三千五百萬噸的小麥和其他五穀便可取麵包消費量的統制。然而照目前的供應量推測，可能輸入的數量決不會超過二千五百萬噸，其中一千禺噸須仰給於美國。觀於美國鐵路車輛缺乏和工潮的情形，看來美國是不能輸出上開數</p>
<p>脂肪和油類的供應量，遠較全世界的需要量短少，據估計，其產量約為戰前產量的百分之八十五，但是脂肪和油類的國際貿易額，未必能超過戰前的牛數。各國將如何分配這些</p>
<p>這些大為减削的脂肪和油類，大部分須視美國的施策如何而定。如果美國取消輸入管制，美國的消費者或許會覺得麥琪林和肥皂比較容易購得，但其他若干國家的消費量，將較一九三九年以前减少百分之七十，在更窮的國家，甚至跌到三分之一。</p>
<p>食糖的世界產量雖已增加百分之十，但仍舊供不應求。</p>
<p>美洲目前的糧食消費量，較戰前多百分之十五，而亞洲和歐洲的廣大地域的消費量，却遠較戰前為少。兩者相較，眞有　壤之別。預料德奧·東歐各國和亞洲各地，均將遭遇嚴重的糧荒。</p>
<p>飢饉的波浪仍將裝鞏世界的大部分，它的嚴重程度若何，還得要看美國對出口管制的政策如何而定。</p>
<p>世界糧食產量今昔的比較如左：</p>

<h3>共軍竄魯的蹤跡</h3>
<p>— 濟南十九日航訊　本報特派麗天</p>
<p>計算起來，山東在「狗肉將軍」張宗昌和韓「靑天」復渠先後統治下，足足經歷了十二個年頭。這種是非不分，黑白不明，苛征暴歛，草薈人命的軍閥統治，在客觀上本就無異為共黨入侵舖下有利的道路。繼續下來，八年的抗敵烽火，山東首當其衝，於二十六年底，主要交通綫即全入敵軍之手，於是在中共「七分發展，二分應付，一分抗日」的基本決策下，其在山東的力量便如火如茶地由發難而發展，由發展而成長長——成長而為國內僅次於陝北而高於東北的中共第二大根據地了</p>
<h3>徂徠山七人　六枝筆起家</h3>
<p>遠在韓復，統　山東時期，現任中共山東省主席黎玉（山西人），就担任着中共山東省黨委書記，潛伏濟南，秘密工作。二十六年七月，敵軍陷德州，韓復渠西遁，　亦將其機關遷至長淸。同年十二月二十四日，濟南失守，黎又遷至縣屬浩萊山，草定山東軍事計劃。俟敵大軍南移，復遷泰安祖徠山下之山陽村。二十七年廢曆正月初三日，黎與其首腦人物林浩（萊陽人），洪濤（贛南豐人），孫陶林（徐州人），馬福堂（諸城人），程兆軒（山陽村人），朱玉幹（徂徠山北王莊人）等，共七人，會議於山上之大佛殿，正式通過了前所草擬的山東軍事計劃，並經決定盡量利用民間槍枝，派定幹員，先在全省分區組成六偶支隊。當時他們七個人共有六枝目來水筆，嘗自詡為「七人六枝筆起家」，亦即今日中共所一再誇耀的「祖徠山七人起義」。</p>
<p>由於黎玉等當時充分把握並利用了平津及山東各地流亡學生的愛國情緒，把他們分別安排在六個支隊中並成了他們最優秀的中堅幹部，再由于抗戰初期國共雙方的宣佈合作抗日，前魯主席沈鴻烈及其部下就認為政府旣宣佈合作，即應禮待之，所以沈嘗發表了好幾位共黨人物祖任縣長，再加以當時山東省境大部淪陷，對未來大局判斷不明，就是一向不滿意共黨的人，此時至少向共黨亦抱下得罪主義，更加以當時第十軍團長石友三的庇護共然與互為利用，因此自二十七年春至二十八年秋的一年半中，魯共便由六個支隊擴展到九個支隊，人數亦由七個人擴展到三萬多人了。</p>
<p>徐向前改變作風</p>
<p>八路軍驍將徐向前的一一五師，是二十八年三月先入魯西，再竄魯南的。在徐向前未入山東以前，常時的共軍無論對人民對國軍，至少在表面上都還循着合理合法的軌道行事，國共之　，或多成少還能保持着和平與合作，自徐向前進入山東，延安方面命徐指揮整個山東軍事後，他一改從前作風，採取了恐怖政策。只要是能遂行他的「七分發展，二分應付，一分抗日」的基本決策的，對國軍不妨分他，不妨襲擊，對人民不妨嚴刑酷法，供渠驅策，對敵寇只要利害不衝突，不妨狼狽為奸，相互為用，於是人民被脅迫着參加共黨共軍的遂急劇增加，國軍，尤其省府轄下各地方團隊游鑒支隊被襲擊剿械的便時有所聞。廿八年底，于學忠奉命來魯成立蘇魯戰區總司令部，由於于沈的不協調，在客觀上反替中共創造了許多擴張實力的好機會。當時沈主席所部各游擊隊因多係民間武裝改組而成，其力量較脆弱，兵力亦分散，遂成了中共擴張實力最理想的對象。各滬擊隊被襲擊後乞援于沈，沈只有乞援於于總司令的正規軍五十一及五十七等軍，而于部則抱自掃門前雪，「他不犯我，我不打他，」多不作適時的拯援，於是二十八年冬至三十年冬，共軍幾乎把魯省府各行署各縣府的地方部隊及游擊隊的主力，硬打軟吃得一掃精光。接着，卅一年敵軍的大掃蕩，沂水「圈襄」總部根據地也被迫着不得不放棄，於是沈至中央述職，調堂農林部，中央派于部下五十一軍軍長牟中珩任魯主席，軍政是一元化了，但經不起敵偽的一再掃蕩，共軍的多决夾攻，再加以卅一年秋于部五十七軍萬旅長毅的投入八路及卅二年初新四師師長吳化文的投降敵偽，山東局勢，益岌岌可危，如此直牽延至卅二年夏，總部曁省府終於不得不撤入皖北阜陽，到卅四年六月初，何前主席思源隻身化裝入魯前，整個山東是一直在敵偽和共軍的盤據掌握中的。</p>
<p>一個癌　由此長成</p>
<p>在抗戰勝利前，共軍就首先利用各種方式，先後佔領了沂水，蒙陰，費縣等廿三縣城。日本投降後，共軍利用國軍接交佈署未定時，首將原駐山東部隊除新四軍的六個師以外（新四軍共七師，其中第五師當時在蘇北，徐向前部已調赴東北。）以九個支隊及各縣民兵中之優秀者為基幹，本年一月底，已陸續擴編為十一個解放師，七個新編師，七個縱隊，十個警備旅，四個獨立團，共計四十二萬九千四百人。（抗戰勝利前，徐部即他調，山東軍事即改由陳毅指揮，此點容後詳）同時，自卅四年八月十一日至卅五年一月十三日停戰令前，又自國軍手中將平度牟平烟合成海衛等六十六縣市攻佔，襲擊國軍二一九四次，斃國軍師長一，旅長二，專員四，縣長十七，及中下級官兵五萬餘人，又向敵偽手中攻佔東陝西省萊蕪等六縣，收編日軍五千餘人，偽軍張希賢韓壽臣等五萬餘人。一月十三日停戰令公佈後至四月廿一日問共軍又攻佔溜川縣城與洪山等十九車站及煤礦兩處·六月八日至十七日間又發動大攻勢攻陷膠縣，德縣，泰安，高密，即墨，城陽，周村，張店，棗莊等五縣四鎭，停戰令成了政府的片面義務，雖經政府於六月十九日向北平軍調部提出備忘錄，共軍仍進攻如故。政府為了自衛，於去年雙十節前後，乃由抗戰名將王耀武打通了膠濟綫，去年底至最近，為粉碎其鉗攻徐州的計劃，發動了魯南大會戰，共軍場亡在三分之一以上，其實力雖已漸减，但因九年半來其根深蒂固在山東所養成的足可燎原的氣燄，迄未稍殺。山東一〇七縣，三普通市，一特別市，迄今在國軍手裏的還只是卅四縣，一普通市（濟南），和一特別市（靑島）。觀乎共軍邇來紛自東北及冀察晋方面源源增援，可知其對盤踞下魯境之三分之二的縣市，仍將以最大的代價來廝守的。</p>
<h3>今年是否再鬧糧荒？</h3>
<p>— 紐約十四日航訊　蕭夫</p>
<p>今年世界不會像去年春夏的時候，發生嚴重的糧荒？許多國家糧食仍然不够，有的地方還會飢荒，不過不太嚴得罷了。今年的糧食的出產刋卜較豐，而且戰時毀壞的交通可以　漸恢復，所以食糧問題。有較好的解決的希望。</p>
<p>世界各處的麥，糖，土豆的產量會增加，捕魚的數目亦較多。米，菜油的產量亦可增多，但肉類，牛奶，及猪油等仍如今年一樣缺乏。</p>
<p>從各洲產麥區域所得的報吿，今年的收成較戰時任何一年為優，產量的等於五·九〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇「布塞爾」（Bushel）。這是吃麵包的人民所以樂觀的原因。</p>
<p>吃米的人民——大部在亞洲——也可望有較好的收成，但較戰前，恐怕要减少十分之一。亞洲人口增加頗速，收成恐不足以避免飢荒。去年收成為六·三〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇「布塞爾」，今年約為六·九〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇「布塞爾」，但較諸戰前之七。四〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇「布塞爾」相去仍遠，困難的地方在歐亞兩洲。</p>
<p>歐洲</p>
<p>歐洲食物以麵粉為主，產量將為一·二〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇「布塞爾」，去年產量為一·〇三〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇，戰前平均產最為一·六二〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇「布塞爾。」　英國及西歐大雨東歐天早，皆足减少出產。英國在收割的時候連天陰雨，數類都了芽。這類的糧食不能作麵包，只能給　牲吃。</p>
<p>東歐及歐陸的俄國缺雨，米麥的收成都不好。中歐和東歐所出產的麵粉，土豆，和糖，不遇稽微超過戰前的百分之七十。這是由於肥料的缺乏和政治不安所致。</p>
<p>和暖的地中海地帶，有豐收之望。希臘，養大利，西班牙，及法屬北非，今年的收成都比去年為優。米，麥，土豆，糖，油的產量可達戰前平均數的百分之八十五。</p>
<p>德國西部和奧國的收成最無希望，天氣不佳，政治紊亂，人工缺乏今年和去年會一樣的黑暗。</p>
<p>亞洲</p>
<p>亞洲出產雖多，但人口增加太快，兩相抵銷。印象在過去五年中增加了二千五百萬人口。</p>
<p>暹邏，緬甸，及安南向為產米之區，但現在的出產不及戰前的水準，日本的侵略為害頗大。</p>
<p>印度在十二月收割以前，有幾個乃難過的日子。在這個階段，一方面從外國運糧食進來，另一方面减少分配的歟量。印度依賴美國，巴西及其他國家接濟。不過外國的接濟為數有限，艱苦的歲月是不能避免的。</p>
<p>西半球大有半收的景象。</p>
<p>加拿大</p>
<p>加拿大明年可望收穫麵粉四億「布塞爾」，為一九四二年來最高的紀錄，較戰前平均數超過百分之卅五。一些食料正向英國運送中。</p>
<p>美國</p>
<p>麵粉可望收穫一·一六〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇「布塞爾」，較去年增多三·七·〇〇〇·〇〇〇「布塞爾」。米的收穫可有同樣的數量，美國去年有一部分糧食運到歐亞兩洲，救濟糧荒。今年出口的數目為二億七千五百萬「布塞爾」。因為有一部分糧食要積存起來，預備收成不好的年月用。</p>
<p>油類今年出產不佳，還要進口一部分。現存的數景為二十年來最小的數量，肉類的產量亦較去年為少。</p>
<p>美國獨頭工人罷工，糧食不能外運，遠東許多期待美國糧食的國家頗感恐慌，除此以外，因戰爭所造成的交通的困難，亦為運輸的困難。</p>
<p>阿根廷</p>
<p>阿根廷米麥的出口均較戰前水準為低，但肉類出口較一九四五年為高。去年耕種的田地增加了百分之十，今年的收獲可望增加。</p>
<p>今年世辦的糧食供給，較比去年為優，除去收成的因子以外，還有下列的原因：</p>
<p>分配制在許多國家仍繼續搜推行。如蘇聯和英國仍維持麵包的分配制度。</p>
<p>有些國家急需糧食的，予以接濟。這個辦法，仍將繼續，需　財政上幫助的國家，亦將予以補助。</p>
<p>糧食的出產雖然數多，但船隻似有問題。如無充足的船隻，糧貪不能外運，有等於無。所以現有的船隻應留一大部作為運輸糧食之用。</p>
<p>總之，今年世界大槪可免於大規模飢荒。不過要想恢復戰前的日常飮食，還有一個相當時期。在一九四八年以前，不會有豐富的跡象。</p>
<h3>台灣林業試驗所</h3>
<p>— 台北七日航訊　本報駐台記者楊育</p>
<p>從前葡萄牙人用：「Ilha　For　Mosa」（美哉綠洲）來稱讀台灣。的確，從台灣的水平來說，有熱帶與亞熱帶之分，從垂直面來說，又因為土地高度不同而有熱，溫，寒三帶，加上豐富的雨量，充足的光熱，因此林森適於滋長，種類尤其繁多。佔有全省總面積約七成近三千八百萬畝的森林，永遠葱　地覆蓋在這廣裏的海島上。</p>
<p>養雞吃蛋　消費超過生產</p>
<p>日本人佔領台灣以後，很重視林業，一方而在產業的開發上需要林木來作為原料，燃料及資料，一方面保護林太來减少地質崩壤和風雨災害所帶來的損失，因此在經營，開墾，調查，研究，試騐等部門多貫注全力，很做出一點成績。根據過去的統計雖然台灣每年森材的消費量總是超過生產量，但這正是日本人養雞只吃雞蛋的作法，到了我們手中，假使任意濫加砍伐而不知保護經營把雞連皮帶肉的吃下肚去，我相信總有一天台灣只會剩一點寒帶樹林堆在那人跡罕至的高山頂頂端。</p>
<p>遠在日本明治四十四年（淸宣統元年），在台灣的殖產局下面，就設置了林業試騐的機構，其後在名稱上，系統上雖屢有更易，然而一貫地為台灣的林業作一個極有計劃的試騐，初無二致。民國二十八年道個機構就直屬於總督府，稱為「台灣總督府林業試驗所」，裏面分設了殖育，施業，木材，林產等科，凡有關於森林的硏究，試騐，調查，製造，培育，利用等所有的工作，多完全包括在內，這種極具規模的研究機關，記者是很願意把它向國內作一個介紹：</p>
<p>滿圓培塿　整理煞費苦收</p>
<p>林業試騐所設在台北植物園內，這裏原植有植物一千二百多種，包羅萬象，有如一個世界性的園圃，可是經過了這次戰爭，因為場內設置防空洞的關係，以致隨處窟窿，所植樹森有的遭空襲折幹斷枝，有的在勝利後被當地人加以斫伐，只剩下了滿地高不滿三寸的根莖，接收時只是滿園萋萋荒草，這種損失短時期內是無法求得補償的。現在逐漸經過整理，伐掉的也只有任它去，僅存的六百多種植物剝去了腐蝕枯黃的枝葉，再添設了許多標籤，看上去似乎已有了些生氣。</p>
<p>房屋的損害還小，圖書接收到二千五百多册，標本有二萬六千八百多本，的六千餘種，儀器如顯微鏡，切片機，試騐機等也有嬰百件，三夾板工場和製紙工塲，規模相當大，可惜接收時竟會失竊掉八架電動機。</p>
<p>人造象牙　利用木材提糖</p>
<p>該所現分為森林殖育科，森林生物科，森林化學科，森林施業科，森林利用科，木酥科學。殖育科原來計劃調查有用樹種的生芽，開花，結實的時問，硏究有用樹種的育種，特別置重點於品種的改良，研究觀測有關於森林育成的各種氣象，調查分析森林土壤肥料理化學的性質，例如土壤的溫度，土壤的透水度，土壤中水份及空氣量，土壤的化學成分等等，各種有用樹森木研究，調查，試騐的項目有十九種，但據林渭訪所長吿訴記者，因為約定的人員還沒有完全到達，徵用的日人又已遣回，所以不得不採取局部試騐，現在正在試騐苗木與溫度，水份，土壤，光度的關係。生物科成立了不久，着重在植物園方面的整理，同時對植物的分類，生態，生理，分布，也加以一個有系統的調查。施業科本來計劃硏究關於造林的樹形調整，試騐間伐造林，以及其他有關森林保護的硏究調查和試騐，現下正着重在材料的整理和計劃的創作上，許多實際工作多由各分所執行，化學科專為林產物的利用興增殖的硏究，調查，試騐與分析鑑定，目前這裏巳從察於皮革染色物單寗，夾板膠，　酪素（動物性的膠着劑，通常飛機中的夾板多應用此物）的研究試騐已經完成，至松脂提煉部份亦已進行試騐。本年度計劃製造人造象牙（用乾酪素以加熱加壓的方式壓入木頭中即成），電木，利用木材提糖與製造人造毛，人造皮。林所長說，國內學森林的人很少，學森林化學的更微乎其微，可是現在這裏聘到了三個在國內森林化學界很有地位的許貺吾，魯昭褘，王相驥三位來主持這一科的工作，所以將來的發展是很値得期待的。</p>
<p>製三夾板　木材纎維造紙</p>
<p>利用科原計劃定有木竹材的利用硏究，調查及試騐，木竹材的鑑定及物理與機械性質的試騐等幾項，現在木材强度部份在强度試騐室中添裝了「amsler」式三十噸强度試騐機一具，並向第三飛機廠借了一具五噸的「akashi」式的强度試騐機，進行各種木材的負担强，抗壓强，抗張强，抗剪强，抗割强及硬度等，尤其着重在飛機用材的各種試騐。木材的解剖部份以及木材工藝性的加工試騐亦在進行中。在現代木材應用上的一件重要工作就是木材的人工乾燥，這裹近已着手試騐，木材防腐的方法很有趣，用各種不同的藥劑，分別輕重的用浸入法或加熟法壓入木材中，然後再放在菌瓶裏看它腐蝕的情形，加以研究試騐。三夾板工場一切裝置多已配備好，</p>
<p>集團盜伐　林橫遭摧殘</p>
<p>該所現在設有四個分所，即台南嘉義的中埔分所，高雄的恒春分所，台中的蓮花池分所，台東的太麻里分所與八仙山一個試騐地，幾乎在每一個緯度中分配一個，所以研究上的價値很大。日本人過去的確化費了一番心血在道些地方經營，例如蓮花池分所裏肖楠木，廣葉杉，紅檜等試騐地林齡已有三十餘年，可是勝利後竟被當地　民將這些優良的試騐林加以集團盜伐，平埔支所內植有柚木，銀樺，印度檀樹，鐵刀木等貴重樹林，經四十年的試騐時間，生長很適宜，成績亦佳，可惜勝利後優良試木也盡遭伐去，該支所嘉義試騐地的印度橡樹及檬果樹專供取膠的，亦被人盜竊，單柚木就被盜了七十三株，恒春分所專事引種南洋外來名木，有在十餘種，生長得很好，是朱來推廣的佳種，然而仍遭當地人的公然摧殘，同他們理論，他們會捋袖露臂的說：「三民主義規定民有民治民享，所以這些林木是我們的，而且三個民就有一個主義，我們要怎樣斫就怎樣斫」林所長說，這是他接收了林業試騐所以後最感痛心的事，然而好好的基礎遭到這種拙殘，誰不感到痛心？</p>
<p>過去成績　再加發揚光大</p>
<p>據林所長說，日本人過去在林業試騐所中，很表現出一點成績，除掉植物園和臘葉館的標本値得稱道外，在造林試騐上，可以舉出叛件犖犖大者的成就：如播種造林試騐，林木種子試騐，容器大小與種子之容重幷粒數的關係，相思樹種子發芽促進試騐，大王揶子及亞力山大椰子種子發芽促進試騐，香椿種子發芽促進　試騐，梓樹種子貯藏試騐，奎寗種子貯藏試騐，香杉及亞杉之母積年　與種子的形熊與發芽力關係試騐，台灣北部地方杉樹造林及其生長量調查，台東漆樹移植試騐，爛心木，烏柏的移植試騐，毛柿樹栽培試騐，柚木苗太養成法試騐，木麻黃造林試騐，可可椰子殖育試騐，紅木移植試騐，印度植權的插木造林試騐，銀樺鐵刀木苗木義成試騐，奎寗栽培試騐，可卡樹栽培試騐，膠樹殖育試騐。關於有用植物試騐計有龍舌蘭麻，千歲菊，馬尼剌麻，紅頭嶼及琉球絲芭蕉，巴拿馬帽草等移植試騐二十多種，有着這樣好的基礎，我們是希望能再加發揚光大的。</p>

<h3>南昌十日航訊　搶救江西農工</h3>
<p>— 本報記者劉藻</p>
<p>江西善後救濟工作的步驟，據蔡孟堅署長在一次工作檢討會上報吿是：先救生命，决救生活，再决是救生產。目前已到救濟生活與生產的階段，他們乘着這個指示，和四個業務原則——一·善後分點，二·救濟分縣，三·運輸分綫，四·督導分區。大部份的工作重點，是在使「江右穀倉」的江西農村復興，蘊藏富庶的破產使它增產，所以現在江西的善救工作，己經是到了善後階段。</p>
<p>復興農村，是現階段的江西善後工作的中心。贛分署除了實施農村緊急救濟，如貸放種子，農具，耕牛，修建農舍等，以協助農民復耕外，並採用新式機械，策進荒地復耕，改良生產技術，增加糧食生產，以達農村復興的目的。</p>
<p>牛痕的流行，是江西農村中致命傷的一種，每年在流行區域因瘟疫而致死的耕牛，約達二萬五千頭。値茲耕牛缺乏的今日農村，死了的耕牛，如何補充，贛分署乃與江西省農業院合辦耕牛防疫大隊，自去年八月下旬開始在本省牛瘟流行最烈的區域，如吉安，吉水，泰和，永新等縣。遷漸實施免費注射。截至去年十一月底，共歷八十三個鄉鎭，注射耕牛二七·八九〇頭，受惠的農戶二六·四五九戶。</p>
<p>為了要安置刦後災農，促進熟荒開墾，並實騐機械化集體農業生產，改進生產技術，復興農村，贛分署特擇定受災慘重的農村，着手建立大規模的合作農場。現在永修縣屬的張公渡合作農場，已完成初步籍備工作，計劃開墾熟地五千至一萬市畝，招致墾民一百至二百戶。預計今年度輔設階段結束後，即可達到自給自足，自力更生的目標。高安縣屬的祥符觀合作農場，亦正在籌設中。計劃先後開墾二千市畝的熟荒，招致墾民四十至五十戶。此外江西第三行政區專員公署主辦的扶植自耕農示範區，亦接受了贛分署一千萬元與一千袋麵粉的補助，招致墾民，從事開墾。</p>
<p>修複農田水利，是刦後農村一個亟待進行的工作，因為各地的河堤圩壩，有的年久失修，有的被敵軍挖毀，張國　一先生任內就着手整理農田水利工程，以一億元的經費，與永利局合作，修復南昌，新建，永修三縣圩提涵閘，計完成決口六十三處，險段一八九處，涵閘一〇〇座，受益田畝共七六五，五二〇市畝。五月間，分署復與揚子江永利委員會江西區堵口復堤工程處合作，修復本省沿江濱湖圩堤，初期工程，已於南昌巿郊，及南昌，新建，進賢，湖口，彭澤，永修，淸江，豐城，新淦，臨川，餘江，九江，瑞昌，萬年等縣搶修圩堤，二三七處，受益田畝三，四五九，六二〇市畝，蔡孟堅署長有一次偕同聯總代表鄧肯到工作地去視察，認為此種工作，實惠農村，並且更應加强推進，所以再就現有的救濟物資，舉辦第二期，並兼顧防旱工程。</p>
<p>靖江的龍溪閘，與九江瑞昌的九瑞提，這都是該署最近舉辦的幾椿大的農田水利工程。全部完成後，受益田畝，常在一百四十市畝以上。</p>
<p>江西的戰時拋荒田畝，估計當有五十萬畝，未經復墾，贛分署為利用農民冬閑，墾荒增產，經與江西省墾務處合作，以競賽方式發動全面冬墾復村運動，以開墾荒地四十萬市畝為目標。</p>
<p>冬墾復村運動，預定今年三月底以前完成，全部的補助賑款二億元，撥充獎勵麵粉二萬袋，農具二萬件，第一期的款物，已　各縣領發，現正積極推行中。</p>
<p>江西的工業，在戰時遭遇的損失，至為嚴重，就營建來說，全省的房屋損失，估計在百分之五十以上，公路毀損程度，達百分之九十，殘存的水遝噸位，不及戰前八分之一，鐵道車輛遷運無存，僅間有路基，至於原有的公私礦廠，數達二五〇餘家，今能勉强維持生產的同，亦不及戰時總數五分之一，所以省內的各項工業，直接間接所受到的災害至深。</p>
<p>過去一年來，協修公共建築，是贛分署在工業救濟部門中的重要工作，經撥興修的衛生機構，計有五十八單位。其次為協助交通復員，除曾撥麵粉三千袋補助修建南潯路土方工程外，並另撥三千袋補助武萬公路工程。此外如泰和，贛縣，萬安，萍鄕等公路，南潯公路的張公渡橋楔，南城的太平橋，均經該署撥款補助修建，現正分別興工，贛縣的忠孝橋，九江的龍開鐵橋，亦正請款，計劃興修。</p>
<p>發展工鑛事業，為扶助小型手工業約有效措施，江西曾經舉辦紙業，磚瓦業等貸款，同時並代各鑛廠申請工鑛器材，籍圖恢復固有的工鑛事業，但是，聯總配發到江西的救濟物資中，關於工業器材，尚少運到，目前僅已奉准配售售南昌水電廠，及鄱樂，萍鄕，兩鑛的發電設備各一套。至於鄉村工業，則以範圍廣泛，限於人力財力，僅能先從發展特產工業着手，已經計劃設立瓷器，蔴業及製紙三個示範廠，與磚瓦水泥二廠。</p>
<p>江西目前的工業救濟工作，最大的困難，是行總自去年八月起，就停止了原有的建築專款，所以營建工程，不幸宣吿了停止。各地這遇到破壞而急需，補助興修的學校校舍，與農村的農舍，正企望着得到救濟，但是，主辦此一工作的善救公署，亦是「愛莫能助」。現在他們僅能就力之所及致力於興修水利工程，協助交通復員，暨發展特產工業諸項，並注意運用工賑方式，以符「寓善後於救濟」的原則。</p>
<p>全省工礦事業的重建，有待於行總方面工礦器材的運到。這是工業復員中的一個緊急呼聲。</p>

<h3>葉遐菴年譜</h3>
<p>— 陸丹林</p>
<p>十餘年來，得閱幾部稱心滿意現代人物的年譜，一是「南通張季直先生傳記」，二是「三水梁燕孫先生年譜」，這兩部傳記，對於八十年內，中國的政治，文化，經濟各方面，都有詳細的叙述，可以做中國近百年史具體而微的參閱。</p>
<p>不過這兩部年譜，是在張梁去世之後，由後人編述的。最近讀到「葉遐菴先生年譜」，更加使我們有深切的認識。因為張在政治上的活動時期很短，梁的服官地點只限於北方，而葉氏呢，除了北方之外，在南方護法之役，任大本營的財政部長，民二十任國民政府的鐵道部長，即在抗戰期間，也任中英庚款董事等職，截至現在，雖然沒有實際的參加政治工作，而其實與文化和經濟建設的事業，還是策劃指導，負了一部分責任。因此，我們把張梁葉三人的年譜，循序的細讀，不啻是中國近百年史的縮本，况且其中有無數的珍貴史料，即在近代史書裏也沒法得着的呢。</p>
<p>葉在交通界裏，世稱龍虎二將之一，龍是龍建章，葉的別號譽虎，故人們便稱他虎了。我們談到當今交通界的耆宿，莫不衆口一辭的首推葉遐菴（恭綽）先生，這是在中國建設界中任何人不能够否認的事實。我們從他的年譜裏六十六年的史事，不特論世然後知人，實在知人也可以論世的。在年譜裏，葉氏從政的開始，是在廿六歲，那年入郵部文案處總務股辦事，未幾，任帮主稿，等於現在一個辦稿的科員而已。可是由帮主稿，不决的擢升，而三任交通總長，一任財政部長和鐵道部長，綜持全國郵電航路四政數十年，確是傑出的建設領袖。我們從他的年譜裏，可以認識數十年來，我國交通政治經濟文化的演進，深可備修史的蒐採，和供研究與旅政的參攷。而他所經的變故，無一不和他生平志業有密切關聯的。</p>
<p>葉氏十八歲應童子試，主考張百熙對於他所作的鐵路賦，異常激賞，因以第一名取入府學。葉氏的受知於張氏，從此開始，而他後來的業績，又多和鐵路發生密切關係，也算一件巧合因緣了。</p>
<p>葉氏幼年，即已聰頴異常。十二歲，與王得庚相見，王即用已名屬對。葉應答「公輸子」，王聞着，驚賞不置。而他在十五歲時所作的「詠蠶詩」五絕兩首，可以槪括他的生平，詩是這樣子說的：「衣被滿天下，誰能識其恩！一朝功成去，飄然遺蛻存。作着忘軀命，辛勞冀少功。絲絲雖自縛，未是可憐蟲！」言為心聲，即此可見他的抱負了。公務員的提升，是有一定程序，前淸官吏的升調，較規在更難，可是他在廿六歲的十一月入郵傳部辦事，第二年的三月，部設鐵路提調處，綜司借款各路事務，他即兼在該處辦事，六月充路政司帮稿，七月以主事候補，八月補七品小京官，九月署主事，充承政應機要科科長，十月充路政司官辦科長，十一月充鐵路總局總科員。等於當時的提調，廿八歲四月補路政司主事，五月晋擢路政司員外郞，九月超擢路司郞中，又轉承政廳僉事。我們只從這一年多的短促時期，不决的晋擢，非有過人的才幹，絕不能有此的升遷，這是證明他有特殊的本領，故此，能够奠定了中國幾十年來的交通事業，門生故吏遍國中。</p>
<p>胡漢民是葉氏的幼年（七歲）同學，在民十二，讀了葉氏的「交通救國論」，曾寫信說，「展誦尊著，翔實透闢，至為欽服。然弟在滬，尙未及見此編，而時人之論交通者，乃鮮公道，則宣傳事業，似講之太遲，以致悠悠者，於輿論佔先入之地位，積毀鑠金，寗非恨事，！…」胡葉知交數十年，尙有如此的話，那些不明白交通事業內容的人，自然更不明白，而對當年主持交通的更加隔膜了。</p>
<p>葉氏固然在交通事業有偉大的業績，但他對於中國數十年來的政治革新，如滿淸退位，甫北和議，討伐復辟，參加護法，東三省易幟，以及文化運動，國民外交，整理國故，編印叢書，提倡藝術，保存古蹟等事工，在他的年譜裏，有詳明的記述，不只是表彰他的行誼，實則足以做我們的導師，這一點，我們讀年譜的不要把他忘却。</p>
<p>這一部年譜，三百八十多頁，是去年十月，遐菴彙稿年譜編印會印行，奉獻葉氐六十六生辰的紀念。因為屬非賣品，除了他的親友門生故吏出資得書存念之外，外間想着得到閱讀珍藏的，恐怕有點不容易，據說初續兩决，只印了兩千部而已。</p>
<h3>談修養</h3>
<p>— 傳統先</p>
<p>朱光潛著　中周社版</p>
<p>朱先生可以說是中國靑年們的導師。他的「給靑年十二封　」是多少年來最受中學生歡迎的一本書。「談美」也是一本好書。不遇我最喜歡他的「文藝心理學」，他的文字不像一般所謂文學家故意雕琢，可是讀他的書自然而然會長人發生一種美感。十幾年朱先生的思想學間是進步了。他的文藝心理學文字雖是美，可是思想體系的究成還不够嚴密。上月在大公報上讀到他談美學的兩篇文章，我個人就覺得他的理論是嚴密得多了，雖然在文字的表達方面又似乎略嫌樸素一點。</p>
<p>早就聽說朱先生有一本談修養的書，却沒有法子找到。近來偶然在南京一個書攤上買到了。雖然我仍然和從前一樣喜歡讀他的書，可是頗覺得不如理想的好。朱先生說：「從前在那部處女作裏所說的話很有些靑年人的稚氣，寫時不免為一時熱情所驅遣，有失檢點，現在回想，頗有些羞愧。於今多吃了十年飯，多讀了幾部書，多接觸了一些人情世故，也多用了一些思攷體騐，覺得舊話雖不必重提，漏洞却須塡補。」但是我覺得在朱先生補漏洞的時候把他所「羞愧」的那種富於熱情的稚氣也消逝了。我倒以為這一點是很可惜的。關於談修養的文章雖然我們反對拉畏了頸子呌得而紅耳赤的說敎，可是我們卻願意人家有熱情，有血氣的和我們懇談。我們可惜朱先生這種靑年熟忱的朝氣不够了。</p>
<p>本書是許多短篇的散文彙集起來。開宗明義是一番語重心長的話，他說：「現在的學生們都朝着一條平凡而暗淡的路徑走，毫無補於文化的進展和社會的改善。》他又說：「敎育對於人的質料似乎沒有發生很好的影響。這一輩子的人睜着眼睛蹈前一輩人的覆轍，下一輩子的人仍然睜着眼睛蹈這一輩子人的覆轍，如此循環展轉，一報還一報，『長夜漫漫何時旦』呢？」所以他要靑年們認識他們的時代，認識國家民族現在的地位，認識個人對於國家民族的關係，要把自己造成社會中一個有力的份子。隨着他就談立志，談靑年的心理病態，談怎樣處羣，談惻隱之心，羞惡之心，談學問，談讀書，以至於談交友，談性愛，談消閒，談體育。</p>
<p>這些雖是他陸續發表的感想，但是其間有一個一貫的中心思想的。他自己說：「我大體上歡喜冷靜，沉着，穩重，剛毅，以出世精神做入世事業，尊崇理想和意志，却也不菲薄情感和想像。………我信頓我們四千餘年的積蓄，不向主義鑄造者舉債。」我對於他這些文章所喜歡的就是它們的所談的東西都是作者幾十年的體騐結晶，其中並沒有無病呻吟，玄虛空泛的地方。例如他要靑年人（一）對於自己應有勇氣負起責任；（二）應知實事求是，接受當前事實而謀應；（三）應明瞭自己的心病須靠自己努力去醫治。這些雖略有說敎的氣味，所喜其內容都是經騐之談，其分析尙有科學的根據。而且在根本上如何改造靑年他提出了積極的辦法，郝就是實施一種新敎育，他主張敎育的着重點應由上課讀書移到學習做人方面去。他說：「許多龐雜的課程須經俟刀斬亂麻的手段裁去，學生至少有一半時間過眞正的團體生活，作國體的活動。」他甚至於有一種切合實際的敎育改革方案，和那些好高　遠的敎育家們所談的眞有天鑒之別。</p>
<p>不過我們所要批評的是這些文章幷不如他從前那樣細緻，思想方面也是多憑體騐，少作分析的工夫。這正足以反映戰時生活的不安寗影響了學者們的工作。他說：「這些文章就是深夜裏聽着妻女打鼾寫成的。……我雖然相當用心，文字終不免有些懈怠和草率。」可是這種坦白誠摯的態度仍是可愛的。</p>
<p>記得馮友蘭著者書立說總是「以為我國家致太平，我億兆安身立命之用」，而朱先生却說：「目前許多作者寫書，嘗自認想對建國大業有所貢獻，搖一支筆桿，開一代宗風。我沒有這種學問，也沒有這種野心或錯覺。這本小册子我知道像一朶浮雲，片時出現，片時消失。但是我希望它在這片時間能藉讀者的晶瑩的心雲，如同浮雲藉晶瑩的潭水一般，呈現一片燦爛的光影。精神不滅，這影響儘管微細，也可以蔓延無窮。」我們倒覺得這一片燦爛的光影比那種「為天地立心，為生命立命，為往聖繼絕學，為萬世開太平」的偉著對於靑年所發生的作用還要比較的大一點。</p>
<h3>介紹兩本小冊子</h3>
<p>— 新俊</p>
<p>「我們的祖國」小叢書　新中出版社</p>
<p>最近，讀了「我們的祖國」小叢書己出的三本，覺得是靑年所必讀的書，因為它指出了靑年對於中國的各方面現狀，能得到一儸明確的認識，而且能加强他們對國家的熱愛。它的文字淺顯通俗，很適合於一般廣大的靑年。</p>
<p>現在，我介紹其中優良的二本，鄭重推蔫給諸位靑年們</p>
<h3>「甚麽是國民大會」</h3>
<p>— 彭赫生著</p>
<p>一九四六年十二月初版</p>
<p>「國民大會」這名稱，是每個靑年所熟知的，而國民大會的意義·組織·職權·諸項，恐怕靑年們未必都能懂得，在這書裏，就把靑年所不十分熟悉的部份，明確地講述了出來。</p>
<p>第一，它先說明什麽是國民大會？講出國民大會是行使民權的機構，是保證「中華民國之主權屬於國民全體」；關於直接民權和間接民權，這相對而稱的名詞，作者予以明白說明，中山先生遣敎中的國民大會，本書也舉例說述。</p>
<p>第二，是叙述國民大會的職權：它分制定憲法，行使中央統治權，政治協商會議的決議三方面來說明國民大會的職權，講出其）利害問題，十分正確。</p>
<p>第三，國民大會和國會的方面，它就說明國民大會和國會的區別，內閣制的優點，「有形」的國民大會，所說簡潔而明白。</p>
<p>第四，就講到國民大會組織法和代表的選舉，關於組織法和選舉法的利弊之處，作者予以確實指出。</p>
<p>最後，太書是展望國民大會和民主政治的前途，作者對國民大會和中國民主政治的前途，站在其客觀的政治看法，予以展望式的說明。</p>
<p>中國民主政治必須實施，對於國民大會也就必須認識，那麽，認識國大，請靑年們一讀此書</p>
<h3>「百年來的祖國」</h3>
<p>— 黃藥眠著</p>
<p>一九四七年一月初版</p>
<p>近百年來的中國，一向是人民不願做奴隸的奮鬥的歷史。這本小書，很明凈正確的講出近百年來中國所發生的各項事跡，其內容也分五點來解說：</p>
<p>第一，從鴉片戰爭到八國聯軍之役；我們知道，鴉片戰爭是首先擊破了中國政治經濟的城壁，而使國際資本主義來掠奪和剝削。本書，首先就指出鴉片戰爭和英法聯軍之役，由此而促使中國走上半殖民地之路。此後，作者便簡單說出：太平天國革命運動及捻子騷亂，這兩個反淸專制的運動，作者是簡明的吿訴了靑年。</p>
<p>鴉片戰爭後，邊邊境領土和屬國之損失，這帝國主義者加緊掠奪的事實，作者同樣地述出。至中日戰爭，而使中國地位迅速低落，到那時中國表面上還維持獨立的外貌，而實際上已為列强割成四分五裂，這一段事實，本書也吿訴了我們。</p>
<p>戊戌變法以及義和團與八國聯軍之役，它的經過詳情，本書費了並不多的篇幅，而很明確地寫出。</p>
<p>第二，辛亥革命的起因，經過，以及失敗的敎訓。本書述出同盟會成立的前後，辛亥革命的成功及失敗，南北議與袁世凱，由袁世凱的美夢而引起的二次革命，作者也很適當講出。</p>
<p>第三，它指出第一次世界大戰與中國，至於世界大戰與中日二十一條約，袁世凱稱帝與督軍團造反。這些有關於第一次大戰與中國的史實。均可看到。</p>
<p>第四，五四運動與一九二六年的革命高潮，作者指出五四運動發生的原因及經過，及一九二六年革命高潮的形成。</p>
<p>最後，則是講到九一八事變與抗日運動，這一段事實，每一個靑年或許還記憶得起的，本盡更加強於我們的認識。</p>
<p>這本書，是很明確地吿訴靑年們對近百年中國史的認識——最基礎的認識。一般靑年，均應為一讀。</p>
<h3>「刀口」</h3>
<p>— 黎東方</p>
<p>The　Razors　E　ge　by　Somerset　Maugham</p>
<p>這一本書，初版是在一九四四年二月，到今天已經快有三年，不能算是新書了，然而仍然盛行一時除了此一書局發行了十五版，彼一書局發行了五版，袖珍書局的大衆化版本又印了幾次以外，好萊塢在去年冬天把牠攝成影片，花了幾百萬美金，這張片子以泰倫寳華為另主角，Gene　Tlerney飾女主角，又轟動了全美，在中上流社會的社交塲中，談談「刀口」是很時髦的。</p>
<p>為什麼牠能有如此的成功呢？因為牠最合美國人的口味麽，不僅如此。美國人今天已經能够欣賞不僅僅合於他們口味的東西，我認為這是美國人的進步。這本書把美國人引誘到用用腦筋去想人生問題，而美國人感覺到很有意思。這就是本書獲得巨大成功的原因。</p>
<p>著者是英國人，居住美國很久，十分熟悉，美國社會。他的文章之好，恐怕很少美國人能够及得他，（至多八九個人罷）。他以「人類的束縛」馳名世界，也著過一本有關中國的書，China　Screen，對於中國人之以人為畜，（如拉車拉船等等），很不恭維。</p>
<p>「刀口」二字。來　，是引證印度的經典，Ratha　Unanishad。說「人之得救，猶如爬過刀口」。而本書正是一位靑年冀求得救而救人的故事。</p>
<p>這位靑年是第一次大戰的空軍飛行員，在作戰當中親眼看見最好的朋友為了救他，而中彈墜機，感觸極深。他又看見，一個一個的死屍，在戰塲上堆得像鹹魚一探，而幾天以前他們卻還是生龍活虎。生死之關，他穿過來了，但是不能了解。但是他頗想了解，把其他一切都看淡了。</p>
<p>他回到故鄉芝加哥，未婚妻在期待他，丈母娘在替他計劃今後的出路。最好的出路似乎是參加交易所，作一個經紀人的夥計，發財很快，社會地位很高！這樣，他便可以結婚，生孩子，敎育孩子，他只感覺膩。</p>
<p>未婚妻希望他馬上就職，就了職便結婚。他說，我想先硏究「學問」他硏究什麽　問呢？不進學校去考學位，卻躱在公共圖書館或夜總會裏面，亂看閒書。無計劃地亂看，眞不知要到何年何月。交易所？他毫無興趣。「為什麽要勸人家買股票上當呢？」而且，看過人死，看過人活，跟英雄做過朋友，又看見英雄化為塵土，——再再回過頭來賣股票，算鈔票，太無聊了。</p>
<p>未婚妻很可愛，他知道，他也從禾愛過別的女子。他卻沒有她那麼着急。他請她准假一年，一年後再回來結婚。這位光生從此便流連山水，遍遍遊名都去了。</p>
<p>他連眞正的地址都不給她，呌一個旅行社轉信。簡括來說，他許多時在巴黎。</p>
<p>一年以後，小姐和媽媽來到巴黎，目的是找年靑人，帶他回去：結婚。他很高興，和小姐情話綿綿，但結婚便須做事：賣股票。他哀求讓他再硏究硏究，等到完全懂了人生再說。小姐不高興。</p>
<p>小姐一怒而退還戒指，回芝加哥去和一位股票交易所的小老板結婚。一年，兩年，三年，這樣地下去，生活十分美滿，有吃有穿，生了兩個可愛的女兒。</p>
<p>他並不介意，讀書不算，還要去遍　人生滋味。他到了一個煤礦去做礦工，又到德國的一處農塲去做「長工」。他游歷了許多地方，追求眞理，訪尋名師，在印度果然達到了目的。他獲到為某位老法師的門　，悟得不少妙諦。老法師命令他下山，再到俗世去體騐體騐。</p>
<p>很久以後，他和小姐又晤面於巴黎。世界變得很快。繁榮轉換為不景氣。某次的風潮，把小姐婆家的財產冲得精光。丈夫也得了常常頭痛的不治之症。她們全家搬到一個小城市去住，小姐燒飯洗衣，丈夫去做低級的用力氣的工作，收入很少。舅舅在巴黎還過得去，寫信呌她帶丈夫到巴黎治病。</p>
<p>年靑人己經是中年了。他的名字呌（Larry）拉里。拉里和女方的舅舅仍舊不來往，和著者（Maugam）毛先生很談得來，但是毛先生也不十分知道他的行踪。恰好當小姐全家搬來巴黎以後，毛先生在路上碰見了拉里把拉里帶到那舅舅家去，看看小姐和他的丈夫與孩子。</p>
<p>這一見面，大家都有說不出的情緖。不過拉里還不十分難過。他却把那破產的丈夫的頭痛治好，用他在印度學來的催眠術。大家又到一個下流咖啡店玩去，誰知遇到了一位可憐的故人，在幹神女生涯。拉里決心去救她，使得她脫離了苦海，戒了酒，並且進備和她結婚。然而小姐竟然從中破壞，引誘牠再犯酒戒，使得她自慚形穢，飄然遠引。</p>
<p>在馬賽，這神女和一位水手混得又好又壞。結果是被水手用剃刀片殺死，拌到海中。警察在她的遺物中發現拉里和毛君的名字，找他們去，責成他們料理後事。這位可憐的女性關不過「刀口。」</p>
<p>拉里再不和小姐見面了。他僅僅想回到美國以後，去買一部街車，做個司機。這一個工作收入很好，行動很自由，而且可以多認識人。</p>
<p>「刀口」技術之爐火純靑，亳無問題。他的優點允在於引人深思。小姐不是壞人，是一個很懂道理的平常人。她愛拉里。拉里當然更不是一個負心的壞人，他有說不淸楚的困難。他究竟已經追求到眞理沒有，也很難斷定，也不必斷定。眞理本來不易追求，肯去追求總値得我們同情。那位妓女實在是太可憐了。</p>
<p>美國人的勁兒，誰也佩服。但是他們究竟不像我們老大傷悲的中國民族，不十分知道人世之無常。他們能藉這一本書而肯花費一點寳貴的時間，去想想，當然可以得到不少益處。（咱們中國人和印度人是有點想得太利害了。）</p>
<h3>藝文壇</h3>
<p>— 伯麟</p>
<p>最近有兩個法國文化人到上海：一個是巴黎晨報的總編輯Cartier；一個是女小說家Roube-Jansky。前者是環遊世界，路經中國；後者很喜歡中國，預備在中國各城市多住一些時日，以便認職認識中國。</p>
<p>法國近代最偉大的畫師彼德彭納（Pierre　Bonnard），最近因患肺炎死於加納，藝壇人士均表哀悼。彭納是近代法蘭西畫壇的權威，其成就是法國畫史中的一道里程碑，其死亡實是法國文化界的一大損失。</p>
<p>最近本市法國僑民，組織了一個戲劇社，預備上演舞台劇，現在積極排練中，的在復活節前後可以公演。</p>
<p>法國電影也在本市出現：本月廿三日下午六時在環龍路法國協會曾放映法國新聞片。最近攝製的法國影片則將於三月二日下午六時在法國協會放映，以後或將在本市電影院作營業放映。</p>
<p>法國協會會於最近有文化演講，講題是：「法國文學與今日的法國」，內容對於法國文學最近的三大派別：現實主義（Existen　Tialisme），共產主義，基督敎主義，有詳細的叙述。關於法國淪陷時期的出版物，如著名的「子夜叢畫」，和新出版的雜誌書籍，新成名的作家，以及小說，雜文，詩，戲劇等文學各部門的情形，都有詳盡的介紹。據說以後還陸續有同樣性質的演講。</p>
<p>法國電影刊物權威「銀幕」雜誌最近刊有一篇介紹中國電影的長文，對中國電影的歷史和抗戰期間中國電影的奮鬥情形，有詳細而正確的報道。對中國電影的評價很高，最後並說希望能够早點看到和平後的出品。</p>

<h3>應酬之難</h3>
<p>— 氣樓</p>
<p>數年以前我閱讀一本「走向成功之路」一類的東西，它最使我感觸的一句話，就是說靑年要成功必須向外發展，不怕應酬。其中的第一步，它勸人採取主動，見了認識的人，要先打招呼，我覺得祇要肯做，這乃是呆子也會做的事，於是我就開始實行了。</p>
<p>在一個熱鬧的宴會上面，我遇到了一位曾經見過三次以上的小實業家，我覺得必須實行我的決心了，我走了過去，我的臉向着他，我的眼睛乞求地望着他們的眼睛，他的眼睛望着我的上面；我再走過去，他的眼睛望着我們右面；我又前進一步，他們眼睛望着我們左面；我差不多要碰到他了，他忽然兩眼下垂，望到地而上去了。總之，他什麼地方都看到了，唯獨沒有看見我。</p>
<p>可是我有決心，我低聲下氣地喊他一聲：</p>
<p>「陳先生，！」</p>
<p>他抬起頭來了，他瞪着眼睛望着我，好像在看着一道白粉牆一樣。當這一剎那，我幾乎失去自信，要以為自己認錯了，倘不是他把跟鏡一抬的那個姿勢，使我記起他坐在經理室中第一次接見我的印象。</p>
<p>「我是張氣樓，……」我重新鼓起勇氣。</p>
<p>「呀？」他的眼睛瞪得越發大了，於是他以禮賢下士的態度，異常客氣地說，「對不起，我們好像以前沒有見過，恐怕先生認錯人了。」</p>
<p>「我……我曾經拜訪過您。」</p>
<p>「哦，有這回事嗎？對不起，對不起，我還要和周老說一句話，」他從我身旁直衝過去，和一位小銀行家攀談去了。從此我不敢再看他一面。</p>
<p>從此我知道「應酬」是一件多麽不容易的事，尤其常你遇到近視而善忘的貴人的時候。</p>
<h3>小事件</h3>
<p>— 季水</p>
<p>早晨六時十分才開的杭滬火車，我於四時趕到，已快無插足之地了。幸而行李簡少，才擠呀擁進一輛差不多與我有同樣年齡的三等車。</p>
<p>終於我我佔了一較為寬敞的立足地，我一手扶住人家坐椅的靠背上，又用「稍息」的姿勢站着準備久　立，車中又無電燈，祗有從月台上泛來一點悽悽的寒光，我一面又以「靜觀萬物」的心情，悠然把望着車箱裏的同伴，他們：有的打瞌睡，有的在撩天，有的惡駡，又有的在講好話，而車門依舊擠呀軋呀，源源上來。忽然，我身傍着的抱小孩的婦人和坐着的一個男人爭了起來，女的說，我因為抱着小孩子，所以長久站着是吃不消的，我只要你一點點地方，你不過稍稍擠一點，那有什麼關係呢？男的說，我兩點鐘就來了，才有這一屁股的坐位，如果讓了你，我這三四個鐘頭的「早」不是給你「起」了嗎？我又沒有受你的錢？况且你旣然曉得要坐，你為什麼不早些來？繼又見另一個站着的男人說，你這個人為什麼這樣不講禮，人家抱小孩子的女人不坐，反讓你年紀靑靑的身壯力健的男人坐，你安心嗎？一點不懂規矩的。忽又另一個男人大聲說，這是他的優先權，關你何事？現在這個世界，那裏在講禮？那裏在講禮？終於擠出了半屁股地方，讓那位抱小孩的女人坐着，風波便立刻平下來。我於是用驚奇而又敬佩的目光，對他們每個人瞧瞧，想不到這世界上久已絕跡的「公正」，敢言敢說的美德，都在今天無意中遇到了。</p>
<p>直到車進臨平站，大家放下玻璃窗，向小販們買五香荳腐干，茶葉鷄蛋的時候，我始知道他們一對是夫妻，二位是同鄕弟兄，於是，我重又茫茫然了。</p>
<h3>我不願意被侮辱　女職員看女花瓶</h3>
<p>— 林梅</p>
<p>看到人家有職業，我很羡慕，自己也想找到一個職業。可是找什麽職業好呢？機關中的女職員，向來被人稱之為「花瓶」，花瓶這一個名字，多少有一些被侮辱的氣味，我並不羡慕，我願意用我的智力和體力，來換取我應得的報酬；因為，我也知道，不管勞心勞力，總是勞工，勞工是神聖的。</p>
<p>我想找到一個職業，終算給我找到了。我是一個某某公司之中，在經理室中担任了抄寫的工作，經理也給我相當的優待，因此我就高興非凡。可是，我工作了一個多月，給我看出了，原來我是上當了。</p>
<p>事情是這樣的，有一天，也有人介紹來一位女職員，那位女職員穿的衣服非常樸素，面色稍帶一些蒼黑，而且還有幾粒麻子，可是她的舉動落落大方，談吐也很風雅，據說是在某大學商科畢過業的。這是一位人才，照例，是應被錄用的了，因為我們公司中小學程度的女職員也有好幾個呢，然而，出人意外，未得經理先生的靑睞。</p>
<p>我很是奇怪，因此就加以細細地研究了。原來，經理先生錄用女職員的標準，還是在一儸「色」字上面，所以我們公司中的女職員，大都是年輕而美麗的，沒有黑臉的麻子，沒有鷄皮鶴髮的老婦人，那無怪那位麻皮的新的女職員不被錄用了。經理先生還不是利用我們的臉龐給他賺錢嗎？我明白了這一點，不禁生出了無窮的悲感，原來我之謀得位置，還是靠着我的年靑和美麗的面龐。假使十年二十年之後，我還不是照舊要失業嗎？我目前還不是依舊是一隻「花瓶」嗎，</p>
<p>我感覺已被侮辱，但我怎樣才可以不被侮辱呢？</p>

<h3>談團拜戲</h3>
<p>— 松</p>
<p>近日競尙合作戲，滬上及京中，每萃名伶，各演其拿手戲，以資號召。其實即北平所演義務戲堂會戲之濫觴，而追原其初，實開始於各科之團拜戲。蓋從前戲班，規例極嚴，甲班之伶，萬不能在乙班出演，惟團拜戲則集各班之伶，凡從不合作者，皆可合作，而除各科團拜外，首推軍機處團拜。每歲新正初二日，必舉行一次，余於光緖五年己卯，隨侍入都，次年庚辰團班，即先公承辦。其時張子靑相國樞廷，最嗜戲劇，故所演每極一時之盛，而各科科運，有盛有衰，盛者獨立舉行一次，衰者則合兩科，或三科同舉，如先君之道光巳酉科，先兄之同治庚午科，皆最盛之科。團班地點，恒在財盛館，文昌館，光緒中葉，則在湖廣館，光宣之際，則在江西館，而科舉旣廢，義務堂會乃接踵而興。民初及十七年以前，乃極盛時代。然團拜戲，光緖初至戊戌為一階段，其時如小樓之父楊月樓，叔岩之父余紫雲，寳忠寳森之祖楊桂雲，皆一時之選。而每次必有崑劇，如慧寳之父時小福，幼芬之父朱蓮芬，皆為此中翹楚，且必有名票客串，最著者為陳子芳魏瑤卿，皮黃戲則月樓之長板坡，與小樓迥然不同，其猴戲以水簾洞為極則，紫雲與小福，則每演必係「玉堂春」「彩樓配」或「祭江」「祭塔」「蒲翻」，而「蒲關」一戲，人極重視之，緣須兩鬚生同演，楊時演時，必菊仙與龍長勝合串，崑戲則朱每演必打棋盤，陳魏之皮黃，則每演必頭二本「虹霓關」。魏瑤卿有「魏要命」之綽號，緣東方氏之妖冶，更甚於荀慧生輩，團拜戲徵名伶，無敢不列者，緣不到則南城坊有鎖拿台柱之可能，亦封建時虐政也。（梨園憶舊錄之二）</p>
<h3>蓮蕊夫人</h3>
<p>— 果華</p>
<p>在「杜美」上映的「蓮蕊夫人，」是一張蘇聯影片；不同於蘇聯多數影片的，它絕無宣傳的意味，雖然在故事開始時，三個說書老人曾說：「此中也有眞理」的話，然而影片對所謂眞理也者，並沒有强調得使人難堪。</p>
<p>故事是一個童話，或者不如說一個民間故事，它說三個兒子娶妻，最小的娶到了一個靑蛙，結果却變成一個美女。其中有蛇精，有妖婦，有蜘蛛精，有屠龍寳劍，聯合起來，確乎是一個有趣的故事。單是為了故事的本身，做父母的大可帶了他們的小寳寳去一看。</p>
<h3>紙煙價値</h3>
<p>— 袁琴孫</p>
<p>報載德國人民不信任法定幣値，而以美國香烟為本位，爭相搜羅，每盒為一千二百馬克，値美金一百念元，如其將我國法幣計算，須一百六十四萬，黃金好賣三兩四錢。美烟在中國每盒三千算，僅値美金四角，依上海市民四百萬，每人一盒一日之消耗，亦需美金一百六十萬，然較德國有天壤之別矣。</p>
<h3>思想可以保持青春　下</h3>
<p>— 學菁譯</p>
<p>不要將你從前日常所認識的靑春同眞正的靑春混錯。因為這可使那已經年老的人回復靑春。無論如何，只要你不以為自已衰老，你便不會衰老。你想避免衰老，結果你却第一個衰老。</p>
<p>現在我要將保持靑春的訣竅吿訴你們：說起來很簡單，就是多注意你的思想，使它永遠的年靑而且富於活力，不要呌你的思想呆不。時代在不斷的前進，注意你四週圍的環境，隨時隨地學習新的東西，這樣你將會永遠的年靑。</p>
<p>此外不要讓你的生活太呆板。我常常看見有兩種個性不同的人，第一種人雖然對於他的家庭及工作很注意，同時又不斷的尋求別約有興趣的工作，他們閱讀報章雜誌，選擇手腦並用的嗜好；另有一種人在三十五歲起，便開始墮入一種刻板而適意的機械式的生活，每日工畢回家休息，晚餐後看些滑稽圖畫，體育消息，或者聽聽無線電而後睡覺。他的妻子則除了管理家務，看顧小孩外，僅聽聽謟媚的歌劇，讀讀曲折的愛情小說，並且參加橋牌戲為消遣。這兩種人，第一種人是隨看年月的增加反而年靑，第二種人則好像受到了致命傷，如果他的生活不改變，在四十五歲的時候已顯老態。</p>
<p>不要顧慮到你的年齡，現在還來得及將你的生活變成更有興趣。不要說：「我老了，來不及了！」記得有位五十歲的主婦，　　有專門經騐，可是結果却成了一個傑出的工業設計家。另有一個年老退休的電氣工程師，現在他巳成了一位高薪俸的製陶藝術家。在我的顧客中，尙有一位七十多歲的老太太，她的兒女說她應該退隱，可是她却很成功的開設了一所新娘烹飪訓練班。</p>
<p>不可以為你已太老，而再到學校裏去。有個人七十歲才進醫科學校讀書，他現在已經成了一位名醫。另有一位在七十歲方始入法科學校，現在也成了一位很活動的律師。一個九十一歲的加里福尼亞婦人，為了休養而入大學讀美國歷史。另有一個女人在七十七歲時方始學畫，在八十歲時開了一次個人作品展覽會。今天效雖已有八十六歲，但仍很健康的活着。所以現在還不算遲，你還可以再創一種新的事業。</p>
<p>總而言之，凡是生活前進的人，不論年紀大小，只要你肯留心的做去，他將未遠地年靑。所以使你的思想永遠地濟醒和活潑，就是永保靑春的秘訣。（譯自讀者文摘一九四七年一月份，＂Your　Mlod　Cau　Keep　Your　Young＂）</p>

<h3>Communist Forces in Shandong Province Encircled; Jiaoji Railway Battle Situation Gradually Stabilizes; National Army Advances North from Tengxian, Recaptures Zou County</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 26th] The war situation in Shandong Province has become one of mutual encirclement. After the communist forces, under Chen Yi, broke out of the northern foothills of the Yimeng Mountains, they joined forces with the communist troops in western Shandong and eastern Shandong, posing a threatening posture towards the outskirts of Jinan. However, they themselves have fallen into a large encirclement by the National Army, and the war is developing in a direction favorable to the National Army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 26th] The battle situation along the Jiaoji Railway is gradually stabilizing. The National Army is concentrating in advantageous areas, ready to deliver a strong blow when the communist forces attack. There were fierce battles in Laiwu, Tuskou, and Boshan on the 24th and 25th. The communist forces in Zhangdian and Zhoucun launched a very intense siege.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Xuzhou, 26th] The National Army advancing north along the Jinpu Railway from Tengxian, with the momentum of a broken bamboo, recaptured Zou County at 4 PM on the 26th. They have joined hands with the Wu Huawen division of the National Army advancing south from Yanzhou. The communist forces fled towards Qufu. Military sources stated that the National Army in Linyi reached the outskirts of Feixian on the 25th, mopping up the remaining communist forces, but did not garrison the county seat. Liu Bocheng led more than 20,000 of his remaining troops and crossed the Yellow River for days, fleeing to Xinxian and Yangyi to reorganize.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Jinan, 26th] The new deployment of the National Army was completed on the evening of the 25th. Except for important areas such as Jinan, Tengxian, and Qingdao, the National Army on both sides of the Jiaoji Railway has completed the sequential transfer. The military strength in Jinan has greatly increased, and the dangerous period has passed. There is now confidence in ensuring the safety of the city. Currently, the more than 80,000 communist troops outside Jinan were generally quiet on the night of the 15th. Several thousand communist troops launched a fierce attack on the National Army near Longshan on the Jiaoji Railway. The fierce battle lasted all night, and the communist forces were repelled by the morning of the 26th.</p>
<p>[Report from Jinan, 26th] The morale of the people in Jinan is stable, and businesses are operating as usual. Due to paper shortages, all newspapers will reduce their original size by half starting on the 27th. To strengthen defenses, the Defense Command ordered on the 25th that all members of the previously discharged merchant corps rejoin the army, and there has been a very enthusiastic response from those reporting in the past two days.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Jinan, 26th] The war on the eastern outskirts of Jinan expanded from the evening of the 25th to Longshan Station, 38 kilometers east of the city. The attacking communist forces numbered approximately three to four thousand. Fighting continued until noon on the 26th. Seventeen stations along the Jiaoji Railway between Longshan and Yidu, as well as five stations on the Zhangbo branch line, have all fallen into the hands of the communist forces.</p>
<h3>National Army Makes Bag-Shaped Advance in Southwestern Shandong and Jinpu Railway; Expected to Join Forces in Yanzhou in Early March</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Xuzhou, 26th] Chen Yi's current strategy in leading over 100,000 troops to attack Laiwu and Bozi is to first attack the rear of the defending forces, cutting off the rear lines of communication in order to isolate the defending forces. The three regiments of the 77th Division of the National Army, and the incomplete 46th Division, 7th Army, and 3rd Army, bravely resisted the invading communist forces in Laiwu, Tuskou, and Boshan, fighting fiercely for four days and nights. After completing their mission, they broke through and transferred separately. The communist forces suffered heavy losses and have become dispirited. Furthermore, the communist forces claimed that the purpose of attacking Jinan was to plunder supplies, but the National Army is absolutely confident in defending Jinan and its surrounding areas. The communist forces attacked the Jiaoji Railway to open up the corridor to eastern Shandong. Military sources also stated that the National Army is rapidly advancing north from southern Shandong, western Shandong, and the Jinpu front in a bag-shaped formation. Chen Yi's remaining troops have fallen into the mouth of the bag-shaped formation. Although they are still jumping around, the communist forces are strategically in a position of inevitable defeat. The National Army in Jinan and Yanzhou can join forces in Tai'an in early March.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Jinan, 26th] Three thousand communist troops attacking Yancheng, northwest of Jinan City, were repelled by the National Army by 2 PM on the 25th. Fighting continued near Longshan Station, 30 kilometers east of Jinan City. Liu Bocheng's 3rd and 6th columns, totaling approximately 15,000 men, had already fled to the vicinity of Feicheng on the evening of the 25th. At the same time, the communist forces were also setting up telegraph lines between Wenshang, Tai'an, and Feicheng, and building temporary bridges at various crossings of the Yellow River, with the intention of joining forces with Chen Yi's troops and launching a large-scale siege of Jinan.</p>
<h3>Communist Forces in Northeast Expand Raids; Fierce Fighting Near Changchun; Fierce Fighting Outside Dehui; Communist Forces Outside Dehui Advance South by Exploiting Gaps</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Shenyang, 26th] The communist forces launched a three-pronged attack on Changchun, with fierce fighting 20-30 miles away. The communist forces on the northern route captured Nong'an on the 25th, and there was also fighting between Jiutai and Jilin along the Jichang Railway.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Two brigades of the 60th Division of the communist forces that crossed the Songhua River began to besiege Chengzijie on the 22nd. The National Army bravely resisted, and fierce fighting continues to this day. On the 24th, the 5th, 6th, and 359th Brigades of the communist forces arrived outside Dehui. On the 25th, they exploited gaps to cross Dehui and advance south towards Buhai. After being intercepted by the National Army, they appeared to be fleeing east. More than 5,000 troops from the 2nd Military Region of the communist forces were discovered west of Nong'an. On the 26th, they detoured southwest of Nong'an and raided Wanbaoshan (southeast of Nong'an).</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 11 PM on the 26th] As of this moment, the communist forces on all lines outside Changchun are in a state of observation and hesitation. The communist forces have even retreated from the Jiutai to Pipichang area along the Jichang Railway. A certain unit of the National Army, which had just retreated from the western section of that line, has turned from retreat to advance. Judging from this situation, the communist forces may have other deployments or may simply know it is difficult and retreat. In any case, the National Army is fully prepared and will not allow them to come and go at will. Military authorities here are maintaining silence regarding the development of the current battle situation. However, it is understood that the rapid advance of the communist forces on all routes yesterday caused some hidden crises outside Changchun. Now that the communist forces have been delaying their movements all day, all defense plans have been successfully implemented, and reinforcements are arriving continuously. Tonight, a reporter met with a senior official and asked him how confident he was in the city's defense. He replied in a conservative manner: "Nine out of ten."</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Changchun, 26th] The war outside Changchun is intensifying. The communist forces are throwing all their strength into a desperate gamble, appearing to be attacking Changchun. The National Army is deploying its forces in a strict manner. It is generally believed that a major battle will soon break out in the diamond-shaped area between Changchun, Jiutai, Dehui, and Nong'an. Although Jilin is currently isolated, Li Hong's 30th Division of the New First Army and Zeng Zhaoyu's 60th Army are closely guarding Yongji. Liang Huasheng flew from Shenyang to Jilin yesterday and telephoned to say that the Xiaofengman Power Plant in Jilin is strongly defended and can be guaranteed to be safe. Communist forces were discovered west of Kalun, Jiutai last night between Changchun and Jilin. The situation in Jiutai is chaotic, and contact with this area has been lost. There has only been outpost contact in the Nong'an area. Huajiaqiao on the Changnong Line has been destroyed by the communist forces. Dehui is still holding firm. [Another dispatch] City defenses in Changchun are being strengthened daily, but the market is still very peaceful. Prices are rising, and there is a possibility of water and electricity being cut off at any time.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Shenyang, 26th] The communist forces in the Northeast have recently launched offensives in the north and south. Communist forces in the Andong area have also been mobilized. The Shen'an Line was still closed on the 26th. Benxi suddenly reported a tense situation. Communist forces were discovered 50 miles away, advancing towards Benxi.</p>
<h3>Situation in Pulandian Remains Tense</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Shenyang, 26th] The situation in Pulandian remains tense. At about 4 o'clock on the 26th, communist forces destroyed two sections 24 kilometers north of Wafangdian. Six employees of Wangjia Station are missing. Communist forces, totaling about 2,000 men, who had previously sneaked across the frozen sea surface south of Pulandian and west of the railway, are now converging in the Jindoufang Hejiagou area, about 30 li northwest of Wafangdian. The National Army is tracking and pursuing them.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Shenyang, 26th] The 11th Brigade of the communist forces, numbering about 3,000 men, which was previously in the area northeast of Yunshanguan in Andong, destroyed the railway bridge at the Xiamatang Station on the Shen'an Line and has now reached Motianling, attempting to eliminate the security forces. The National Army has sent strong forces to reinforce.</p>

<h3>Declaration by Three Groups in Beiping Demands Ban on Democratic League</h3>
<p>And Prohibition of Communist Party from Enjoying Human Rights</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 26th] The Beiping City Chamber of Commerce, General Labor Union, and Farmers' Association issued a declaration today demanding that the government ban the Democratic League and prohibit the Communist Party from enjoying human rights. This declaration opposes the call for the protection of human rights issued yesterday by 13 professors from Peking University and Tsinghua University, saying that these professors are deliberately opposing the government's security measures, which is quite strange. The declaration by the three groups also stated: "Our associations are uneasy day and night, fearing that the Tongzhou Incident will be repeated in Beiping. The Democratic League is the tail of the Communist Party and should be banned. The Communist Party does not hesitate to destroy the Constitution, endanger peace, burn property, and destroy highways and dams. The four freedoms announced by the Chairman should not be enjoyed by the Communist Party. We urge the government to order a suppression to restore order."</p>

<h3>Secretary of State Marshall Declares; US Troops Determined to Withdraw as Soon as Possible; Military Aid to China to Be Drafted Separately</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 25th] Secretary of State Marshall recently made a statement on the China issue at a press conference. He said that the Chinese government is currently working to eliminate the technical difficulties in the transfer of surplus materials and the implementation of the 1946 Ship Donation to China Act. The Act provides for US naval training, service, plans, and technical consultation for China, and its purpose is to relieve US forces of their duties in China and to further ensure or improve the safety of navigation within Chinese territorial waters.</p>
<p>Regarding the withdrawal of US troops from China, Secretary of State Marshall said: "The withdrawal is in progress, but the progress of the withdrawal of the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation is unknown. The US Marine Corps is withdrawing as quickly as possible under the circumstances of completing transportation permits and safety obligations."</p>
<p>When asked whether he would submit another request to Congress to allow the stationing of a military advisory group in China, Marshall replied that a bill for an independent military delegation has been under consideration for a long time, but its scope is not limited to China but is of a general nature.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 25th] Secretary of State Marshall declared here today that the State Department has abandoned the attempt to request Congress to appoint a military advisory group in China. Any military assistance given to the Chinese government in the future will be based on a general plan. The plan is currently being drafted for general use in South America and other countries and will be submitted to the current Congress for approval. At the opening of the last Congress, the State Department separately submitted a special bill to both the Senate and the House of Representatives requesting approval for aid to China, but it has not yet reached the stage of formal discussion. Secretary Marshall also said that the State Department's main task regarding China is to work to eliminate the technical difficulties in transferring US military surplus materials and to urge Congress to approve the sale of merchant ships to China. However, Secretary Marshall did not explain what steps would be taken to urge Congress to approve the sale of merchant ships to China and other countries under the Ship Sale Act of 1946. Marshall also did not specify what the technical difficulties in transferring surplus materials were. According to the surplus materials agreement signed in Nanjing last year, most of the materials are scattered on islands in the Pacific Ocean, and the main difficulty may be transportation issues.</p>

<p>Q: According to Communist reports, the National Army has suffered setbacks in central Shandong. What is the actual situation regarding the telegrams received recently?</p>
<p>A: I do not wish to elaborate on the recent military situation, as the matter has already been reported in detail. It is merely Communist propaganda. In fact, the National Army is advancing step by step, recovering many areas, while the Communist forces are retreating step by step.</p>
<p>Q: The government is guiding the people to voluntarily exchange gold and foreign currency at the Central Bank at standard rates. What is the reaction of people at home and abroad? Are there any accurate and reliable reports?</p>

They came to China according to a plan agreed upon by the Chinese and American governments, and after cooperating with our agricultural technicians in investigations, they have already returned to the United States. The suggestions made by the team are being carefully studied by our Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. Recently, four more American agricultural professors arrived in Nanjing. Two of them will work at the Central Agricultural Experiment Station. The other two will teach at Central University and Jinling University, respectively, specializing in agricultural engineering.</p>
<p>Q: The Shanghai XMHA radio station is said to be run by Archbishop Yu Bin. Why was it shut down? A: Recently, the government has been cracking down on unregistered radio stations.

However, this does not affect the government's trust and appreciation of Archbishop Yu Bin and the work of the Catholic Church.</p>

<h3>UNRRA's Work in China Needs to Be Extended by Three Months, Jackson Has Made a Recommendation</h3>
<p>[Report from our agency] UNRRA Deputy Director-General General Jackson came to China at the invitation of the Chinese government to inspect and study post-war relief work, so that UNRRA's mission in China can be completed satisfactorily. Jackson held a press conference at the New Asia Hotel at 11:00 AM yesterday, reporting on various issues related to UNRRA's work in China. UNRRA's Resident Director-General in China General Egerton, Chief of the Far East Division of the Vocational Training Council Colonel Harris, and Director of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Huo Shishu attended. Jackson first denied the recent rumors that the Chinese government had asked UNRRA to revise its established plan and replace it with US$200 million worth of cotton and wheat shipments to China to stabilize the Chinese currency system. He solemnly stated: The Chinese government only requested UNRRA to purchase and ship cotton to China with the remaining funds that have not yet been designated for use. UNRRA recently received a formal request from the Chinese government, the content of which is limited to this. All the rumors outside are misunderstandings. Jackson said: "There is still a balance of 19 to 20 million US dollars in UNRRA's budget for China that has not yet been determined for use. The UNRRA Central Committee will consider the Chinese government's request for this fund. The UNRRA Far East Regional Committee held a temporary meeting in Shanghai the day before yesterday. Representatives from various countries made a preliminary discussion on the Chinese government's request. Four recommendations were resolved and submitted to the Central Committee in Washington for consideration: (1) The Far East Committee agrees to the request to purchase cotton with the remaining funds; (2) The income from the sale of cotton shipped to China by UNRRA in the future should be used by the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration for post-war relief undertakings; (3) The Chinese government should submit a detailed budget for the expenditure of the funds from the sale of cotton to UNRRA; (4) The Far East Regional Committee will continue to pay attention to the use of UNRRA cotton. The four recommendations established by the meeting have been telegraphed to the Central Committee, and it is expected that the General Office will make a decision soon."</p>
<p>Jackson finally told reporters: "UNRRA's shipments to China may not be completely exhausted by the end of June. It is necessary to extend UNRRA's work in China. I personally have suggested to the General Office to extend it for another 90 days after the end of June. If approved, UNRRA's work in China is expected to be extended."</p>

<h3>Philippine "Anti-Chinese League" Blocks Chinese from Applying for Naturalization, Philippine Supreme Court Rejects Request</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 26th] The Philippine Supreme Court decided today to reject the request of the "Philippine Anti-Chinese League" to interfere with and oppose the large number of naturalization requests submitted to the court by Chinese applicants. The "Philippine Anti-Chinese League" is led by Senator Saludo, who has a great reputation and whose grandfather was Chinese. The league became known to the public because of a lawsuit filed on October 3 last year opposing Judge Felix of the Manila First Instance Court's approval of the naturalization of Lin Yongluo (transliteration), a local Chinese person. The league asked the Supreme Court to revoke the order of the lower court, arguing that "the applicant failed to explain that China also has the same laws to give Filipinos the same rights." According to reports, Saludo proposed a bill on August 20 last year, asking to amend the Naturalization Law to restrict foreigners from being naturalized as Philippine citizens. The law stipulates that the required ten years of residence for those requesting naturalization should be changed to twenty years, and the special period should be increased from five years to ten years. However, the case was later .</p>
<h3>Gui Yongqing Returns to Shanghai from Taiwan, Talks About Building a New Navy, Going to Beijing Tonight to Inspect the North</h3>
<p>[Report from this city] General Gui Yongqing, Acting Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, returned to Shanghai from Taiwan yesterday morning at 7:00 AM on the "Zhongxing" ship. He is scheduled to inspect the Central Naval Officer School today, and then take a late train to Beijing. Within a few days, he will also inspect naval bases such as Qingdao in the north.</p>
<p>Gui met with reporters from the Central News Agency at the Naval Social Club yesterday afternoon, and discussed various related issues of the Navy. Gui said: Qingdao is our country's ideal naval base. There is currently a Central Naval Training Corps. Recently, it is planned to move the Central Naval Officer School in Shanghai to that location, merge it with the training corps, and establish the "Central Naval School" to train naval officers. This matter will be realized quickly. Although Shanghai is not a good place for training personnel, a mechanical school will also be established. The training of naval soldiers will mainly be based in Zuoying Naval Port in Taiwan and Magong Island in the Penghu Islands. Currently, there are about 20 naval officers and soldiers training abroad in the United States, and 600-700 in the United Kingdom. The batch of officers and soldiers in the United Kingdom will complete their training in the fall of this year and drive back to the country with a cruiser, two submarines, two destroyers, and eight gunboats donated by the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>In order to train a large number of officers and soldiers and study the latest technology, another group of students may be sent abroad for further studies in the second half of the year. Gui's inspection of Taiwan and the southeastern coast lasted for three weeks. He deeply felt that our country's long coastline requires the united attention and efforts of the people of the whole country to build a strong navy. He believes that in addition to Qingdao, there are many good bases between the Penghu Islands and Xiamen that can support each other. It is extremely important for national defense. Our country is currently unable to build warships on its own. It is believed that when there is a solution to the economy, it will be possible to do so. However, the most important point in building a new navy is that everyone must be selfless and strive for improvement. Gui earnestly hopes that outstanding young people from all over the country will actively participate in this arduous work. Gui then talked about his impression of Taiwan, saying: The situation in Taiwan is better than the general situation in the mainland. Except for cloth, there is no shortage of various materials. The people have a sense of right and wrong and can abide by the law. If given enough time, the ideal of the Three Principles of the People can be realized in Taiwan.</p>

<h3>Military and Political Civil Service Examination Work, Review Conference Opens, Dean Dai Delivers Training on Behalf of the Chairman</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] The two ministries of National Defense and Civil Service Examination received a handwritten order from Chairman Chiang, to hold a review conference on military and political civil service examination work on the 26th of this month, with a duration of three days, and designated Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi, Chief of Staff Chen Cheng, and Minister of Civil Service Examination Jia Jingde to preside over the conference. After receiving the order, the two ministries actively prepared for the conference and held it as scheduled today at the Lizhi Society.

Chairman Chiang originally planned to attend the opening ceremony in person, but due to important official duties, he requested Dean Dai to deliver training on his behalf. The main points were: (1) The military and political parties should thoroughly review the advantages and disadvantages of the laws and regulations formulated during the war, decide whether to retain or abolish them, or retain their advantages, or correct their defects, to meet the needs of nation-building; (2) After the success of the Northern Expedition, the country faced frequent disasters. The government followed the teachings of the late leader Sun Yat-sen and established various systems that should have been established, but they were either not established due to resistance, or they were established but not completed. The personnel system was also affected by this and has not yet produced significant results. Today, both the military and civilian parties should thoroughly review and strive for improvement; (3) Civil service examination businesses include employment performance salary reward pension etc. , In fact, It is also nothing more than what Sun Yat-sen calls "education and support have a way", "encourage with strength and make employment legal". We should find ways to accomplish this task; (4) Further this review conference is not only to pick up the advantages and disadvantages and the efficiency of past laws and regulations, but also to require the relevant agencies, especially the two ministries of National Defense and Civil Service Examination, to seek proper solutions for common difficult problems, and strive for effective and tight connections for mutually related problems.</p>
<p>After the completion of the opening ceremony, the meeting proceeded according to the original agenda. Minister Jia of the Civil Service Examination Department served as chairman. Wang Zizhuang, Secretary-General of the Congress, reported on the number of attendees and the preparations. The two departments of National Defense and Civil Service Examination respectively made a work report for the 35th year of the Republic of China, and a report on the implementation of the resolutions of the first review conference. On the 27th, group and joint discussions on military and civilian positions will be held, and on the 28th, a general discussion will be held, and a closing ceremony will be held.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang's Previous Year's Military Quota: Another 5,000 Recruits from Anhui</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou, 26th Dispatch] The total conscription quota for Zhejiang province last year was 27,200, which had already been reported to the Ministry of National Defense by the Zhejiang Military District. The Ministry considered that 5,000 of these were recruited by various military organizations and should not be included in the quota. Therefore, it ordered the special conscription of another 5,000.</p>
<h3>Villagers in Nanbei Bridge Town, Suzhou, Resist Rent for the Second Time</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou, 26th Dispatch] In Nanbei Bridge Town under the county's jurisdiction, farmers rioted yesterday afternoon due to resistance to rent. A crowd of over a hundred people completely destroyed the rent collection offices in the town. Fortunately, no one was injured. A similar incident occurred there last year, making this the second time.</p>
<h3>Major Fire in Daixi Town, Wuxing</h3>
<p>[Our Wuxing Dispatch] Daixi Town, under the county's jurisdiction, is located at a key point on the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway.

The wind was fierce, and the fire raged, burning down most of the town's two hundred-plus shops and residences.</p>
<h3>1946 National Higher Education Entrance Examination: 411 Admitted; Training to Begin in Mid-April</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The results of the 1946 National Higher Education Entrance Examination are scheduled to be released on the 27th. A total of 411 candidates were admitted this time, including 91 who took multiple exams. The breakdown of admissions by department is listed below: For appointed personnel, there are 29 in general administration, 6 in education, 5 in social affairs, 1 in health, 9 in economics, 13 in finance, 2 in household registration, 15 in diplomatic and consular affairs (who still need to participate in oral exams), 18 in accounting and auditing, 1 in land management, and 4 in statistics. For specialized professional exams, there are 53 in civil engineering, 9 in water conservancy, 18 in architecture, 2 in electrical engineering, 19 in mechanical engineering, 12 in chemical engineering, 4 in textiles, 8 in mining and metallurgy, 12 in forestry, [missing number] in animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, 14 in agronomy, and 14 in agricultural economics. For special exams, there are 2 in personnel administration. Chen Daqi, Chairman of the Examination Committee, stated that approximately 4,000 people actually participated in this year's exam, with less than one-tenth being admitted. Less than 1,000 construction personnel participated, but their admissions accounted for more than half of the total, and their scores were also superior to others. This is related to the fact that many outstanding students switched to practical subjects during the Anti-Japanese War. It is heard that the admitted personnel will begin training in mid-April and then be assigned to work in various regions.</p>
<h3>County Council to Convene Once Every Three Months; Speaker and Deputy Speaker Responsible for Convening; Ministry of Interior to Draft Measures for Handling Delays</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] The Ministry of Interior believes that county councils should convene once every three months, as clearly stipulated in Article 11 of the County Council Organization Regulations. However, some county council speakers have neglected their duties and failed to convene meetings within the legally prescribed period, rendering the county councils virtually useless and betraying the government's intention to establish public opinion organs and foster civil rights. To ensure that county councils can convene meetings as scheduled and deliberate on matters in accordance with regulations, thereby establishing a foundation for constitutional governance, the following measures for handling county council speakers who fail to convene meetings within the legally prescribed period are hereby drafted, submitted for approval, and circulated to all provinces for compliance. The measures are as follows: (1) If a county council speaker delays convening a meeting for more than one hundred days without providing a written explanation of the reasons and entrusting the deputy speaker to convene the meeting on their behalf, they shall be deemed to have neglected their duties. The deputy speaker shall immediately convene a meeting and hold another election for speaker. If the deputy speaker is elected as speaker, a supplementary election for deputy speaker shall be held immediately. (2) If the deputy speaker, when convening a meeting in accordance with the circumstances in the first item, still fails to convene a meeting within one hundred and ten days without providing a written explanation of the reasons and requesting the county magistrate to convene the meeting on their behalf, they shall also be deemed to have neglected their duties. The county magistrate shall convene a meeting and simultaneously hold another election for both the speaker and deputy speaker. (3) If the county magistrate delays handling the convening of a meeting for more than one hundred and twenty days in accordance with the circumstances in the second item, the relevant civil affairs department shall order the magistrate to convene a meeting within a specified period, impose disciplinary action, and report to the Ministry of Interior for record.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Concerning the Situation in Korea</h3>
<p>On the eve of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, the situation in Korea has once again attracted the world's attention. General Hodge, commander of the US military occupation zone in Korea, recently returned to Washington D.C. from his post and told the press that the Soviet military authorities in their occupation zone are recruiting Korean men aged 17 to 25, with the Chinese Communist army as the core, in an attempt to form a massive Korean army. He also stated that the ongoing negotiations between the US and Soviet military authorities on the ground seem to have little hope of success. The Soviet Union has erected a dense iron curtain in its occupation zone, making it difficult for us to learn about the situation inside. At the same time, Syngman Rhee, chairman of the Korean Commission, also told reporters in Washington D.C. that he was requesting the United States to arm the people of South Korea and allow them to conduct military training. According to a United Press dispatch, General Hodge also told reporters that South Korea would establish a separate government on March 1st and that he was requesting the Congressional Budget Committee to allocate sufficient funds to carry out the occupation of Korea. State Department officials stated that the United States' policy toward Korea had not changed and that the United States was now planning to pursue two directions: (1) consolidate the economic development of South Korea; (2) establish so-called agreement legislation. Now that reports about Korea continue to come from the United States, the situation in Korea will undoubtedly attract the general attention of the world.</p>
<p>We are closely monitoring the situation in Korea because of our geographical proximity to Korea and the deep historical and cultural ties between us. This newspaper has previously written editorials calling on the world not to ignore the developing situation in Korea. We believe that forcibly dividing Korea into two worlds along the 38th parallel is not only an artificial obstacle to the survival of the Korean people but also contrary to the noble purpose of this world war. Korea has been subjugated for more than 40 years. When it was subjugated, it was the time of imperialist competition in the Far East. After Russia was defeated, Japan, backed by the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, was able to do whatever it wanted. Although Korea declared independence for a time, it was soon annexed by Japan. However, the Korean people have always been very strong in terms of national consciousness. Although the country was subjugated, the national spirit did not decline. Following An Jung-geun's attack on Ito, Korean patriots have made heroic demonstrations in the past thirty years. Today, the prosthetic leg of Japanese war criminal Mamoru Shigemitsu and the prosthetic eye of Kichisaburo Nomura are both due to the heroic actions of Korean patriots. During World War I, President Wilson put forward the principle of national self-determination, but it did not extend to Korea. This has already shown how Western countries cannot shoulder the responsibility of rebuilding the world order. We expressed our deep regret for the Korean people at that time. Unexpectedly, the situation in Korea after World War II is a hundredfold worse than it was then. We would like to express our infinite sympathy for the Korean people in suffering.</p>
<p>Who created this situation in Korea? The responsibility lies with both the United States and the Soviet Union. It is to be expected that the Soviet Union wants to foster forces in its occupation zone that are beneficial to it. However, the United States' occupation authorities in Korea have no clear policy, which has made the situation in Korea increasingly worse. The Soviet Union's occupation of Korea is planned, while the United States' occupation of Korea has no clear and firm policy. The suffering of the Korean people today is mainly due to this. We cannot allow this situation to continue. Originally, since the failure of the US-Soviet conference on the situation in Korea held in Seoul at the beginning of last year, based on the Moscow Agreement, the United States' policy on the occupation of Korea should have been reconsidered. However, in the past year, due to the United States' lack of action, the situation in Korea has not only not improved but has also deteriorated. The United States should bear the majority of the responsibility for creating the current situation in Korea.</p>
<p>Today, when talking about the situation in Korea, we must recognize the Soviet Union's intentions in Korea. General Hodge, commander of the US military occupation zone, openly says that the Soviet Union is training a massive Korean army in its occupation zone, with the Chinese Communist army as the core. We want to ask what is the purpose of this? General Hodge's words are certainly not without basis. What is the Soviet Union's purpose in cultivating this armed force in Korea? Korea is adjacent to our territory, and the armed force cultivated by the Soviet Union in Korea has the Chinese Communist army as the core. We cannot remain silent. From the standpoint of the country, this is an unfriendly expression to China. From the standpoint of the people, this is an act that violates the wishes of the Chinese people. But this happened in Korea. In addition to expressing righteous indignation, the Chinese people hope that the US occupation authorities in Korea can devise a good way to resist it. Not acting is not a policy. We must respond to action with action. Otherwise, others' actions will become increasingly intense, and when the time comes to take action, it will be too late. The independent establishment of the government in South Korea is undoubtedly a reasonable step in the right direction. However, action should not be limited to one aspect but should be multifaceted.</p>
<p>We do not know whether the Moscow Conference will discuss the situation in Korea. What is gratifying is that Secretary of State Marshall said in Washington D.C. yesterday that the Korean issue is not on the agenda of the Moscow Conference. At the same time, Korean leaders in the United States firmly oppose the discussion of the Korean issue at the Moscow Conference. Since the situation in Korea cannot be improved, General Hodge has stated that the ongoing negotiations between the US and Soviet military authorities on the ground seem to have little hope of success. Therefore, it seems that it would be superfluous to raise this issue in Moscow, whether inside or outside the conference. The situation in Korea is clear: the main reason why it has reached this point is the United States' inaction. The United States bears the heavy responsibility of maintaining peace in the post-war world, and the situation in Korea is crucial to the maintenance of world peace. It seems that it can no longer adopt inaction as a policy. We hope that the United States can shoulder the responsibility of leading the world, not only in Korea but also in other regions of the world.</p>

<h3>US-Soviet Dispute Tends to Ease Over Control of Atomic Energy, Avoiding a Showdown; Plan to Refer Back to Atomic Energy Commission for Further Consideration</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 25th] At today's Security Council meeting, the United States praised the Security Council's achievements in the international control of atomic energy and predicted that the United States and the Soviet Union would soon eliminate their differences on this point. US Representative Austin stated that the debate on atomic energy showed that all representatives unanimously accepted the basic principles of the US atomic energy plan. Austin also proposed that the issue be referred back to the Atomic Energy Commission to study the details. Austin pointed out that the serious dispute that remains unresolved is the Soviet Union's unwillingness to waive its veto power when punishing countries that violate the agreement, but this issue is not hopeless. Austin also said: "We are currently engaged in the great undertaking that mankind has never undertaken before. We want to prevent war, and I firmly believe that we will not fail. We will not allow the negotiations to break down." Austin's proposal to refer the atomic energy plan back to the Atomic Energy Commission for discussion is clearly aimed at avoiding an immediate "showdown" in the Security Council, because if the Soviet Union vetoes it in the Security Council, the entire atomic energy issue will immediately be impossible to start. Austin continued: According to "inference," several points in the US atomic energy plan have been accepted by all representatives, because they have not been able to oppose them so far. The above points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) International search of secret atomic engineering; (2) Signing an agreement to abolish atomic weapons and organize international investigation agencies (more than ten representatives expressed doubts as to whether the Soviet Union had agreed to this point in principle, or still insisted that atomic bombs should be destroyed first before the organization of international investigation agencies); (3) The application of atomic energy in peacetime belongs to the international sphere. Austin also listed the unresolved points as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Abolishing the veto privilege of the five powers when punishing countries that violate the atomic agreement; (2) International organizations should control all atomic activities, including the application of atomic energy in peacetime; (3) Should the destruction of atomic bombs be implemented immediately, or gradually implemented according to several steps in a careful plan.</p>
<p>Soviet Representative Gromyko immediately agreed to refer the case back to the Atomic Energy Commission and said: He hoped that the Commission should first concentrate on various broad principles, because if broad principles can be agreed upon, other details can be easily solved. However, the Security Council adjourned without holding a vote.</p>
<p>Formal Voting Procedure Scheduled for Friday</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 26th] United Nations sources said: The Security Council will definitely adopt the US proposal to hand over the atomic energy report to the Atomic Energy Commission for research, so as to reconcile the differences between the US and the Soviet Union. The case is scheduled to be voted on Friday. Since the Soviet representative has already hinted at accepting the US proposal at yesterday's meeting, there is no problem in passing it. This attitude of the Soviet Union can ease the situation, because if Soviet Representative Gromyko insists on extending the discussion of the Security Council, he will not be able to obtain a satisfactory decision.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 25th] At today's Security Council meeting, Soviet Representative Gromyko declared that the Atomic Energy Commission had exceeded its authority. The Atomic Energy Commission did not draft an international convention in accordance with the resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly to prohibit atomic weapons, so it violated the United Nations Charter. Australian Representative Hasluck immediately stood up to refute and said: All representatives of the Atomic Energy Commission agreed to prohibit the use of atomic weapons, but the Soviet representative insisted that atomic weapons should be prohibited first, while other representatives believed that an international control system should be established first. Therefore, opinions differed and could not be reconciled. In fact, the Atomic Energy Commission was acting completely in accordance with the United Nations Charter.</p>
<h3>Former Japanese Mandated Islands; Soviet Union Agrees to US Trusteeship; US Trusteeship Plan Formally Proposed</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 25th] Secretary of State Marshall announced today: The Soviet government has agreed to place the former Japanese mandated islands under US trusteeship. He received a note from the Soviet government yesterday, stating that the Soviet government felt that it was fair to hand over the former Japanese mandated islands to the US trusteeship, because the United States assumed a decisive task in the war against Japan, and the sacrifices of its troops were far greater than those of other countries' troops. Marshall also said that the British government has not yet responded to this matter. He also declined to announce the full text of the Soviet note, believing that it should be announced by the Soviet government.</p>
<p>[Our Report] San Francisco, 26th Broadcast: Authoritative sources said: When US Representative Austin asks the Council to pass the US proposal to govern the Pacific mandated islands, he will provide assurances that the United States' governance of these islands will strive to promote international peace and security.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, New York, 26th] The United States has completed its proposal to unilaterally govern the former Japanese mandated islands today, and it firmly believes that the Soviet Union's sudden change of position will enable the United Nations to accelerate the passage of its trusteeship plan. The US trusteeship plan will be submitted by US Representative Austin at today's Security Council meeting. Austin originally planned to delay it a little, because both the Soviet Union and Britain had requested that the trusteeship plan be established after the completion of the peace treaty with Japan. However, after the State Department learned of the Soviet Union's change of position, Austin also immediately changed his plan.</p>
<p>[Our Report] San Francisco, 26th Broadcast: Regarding the United States' request to place the Pacific former Japanese mandated islands under US strategic trusteeship, the Soviet Union suddenly changed its policy and agreed to the United States' request before submitting it to today's Security Council for debate. The US attitude has therefore become more positive, and it intends to resolve the status of the islands without waiting for the signing of the peace treaty with Japan. US sources believe that Britain and Australia's opposition to immediately accepting the US request will be dispelled due to the Soviet Union's agreement. China and France have already stated that they have no objections unless the Soviet Union firmly opposes it. Observers believe that it is not possible to judge at this moment whether this concession by the Soviet Union is an exchange for the United States to make political concessions in Europe, and it must be decided after the Soviet Union's reply is announced.</p>
<p>The Motive Deserves Consideration</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 26th] The Soviet Union's surprising move to agree to the United States' trusteeship of the Pacific islands immediately aroused informal suspicion here today that the Soviet Union is trying to bargain and extend its influence in the Far East. The Soviet Union's statement coincides with the initial official statement of the Soviet Union's resolution to train a Korean army in northern Korea. According to US official estimates, this army currently has nearly 125,000 people. At the same time, US Secretary of Interior Krug, after conducting a wide-ranging inspection in Japan, will return to Washington with a plan to administer the Pacific islands by civilian officials, which are the islands that the United States has requested to be entrusted with. Experts on US-Soviet relations here do not want to express opinions, but wait for the situation to continue to develop, or it may be possible to determine the Soviet Union's motives. Some Japanese believe that the reason why the Soviet Union mentioned the sacrifices of the United States in occupying the islands is to ensure that all industrial equipment formerly owned by Japan is removed from its territory in the Northeast, because the Soviet Union has long publicized its "sacrifices" in the Northeast campaign. During Krug's stay, he did not want to express opinions on the military value of the Pacific islands, but it is undoubtedly certain that he will meet with military officials. These soldiers believe that the United States' defense line must surround the arc of Guam-Saipan-Tinian and be protected by a majority of forward bases, including Ryukyu and Iwo Jima. The speed of modern weapons has made Pearl Harbor geographically a domestic base and no longer an outpost base. To avoid the recurrence of the Pearl Harbor incident, the United States' bases must be deep in the Western Pacific. Australia has announced that it is concerned about the islands within Australia's sphere of influence, including the New Guinea trusteeship and New Caledonia and the Manus Islands.</p>
<h3>Australian Foreign Minister Speaks Freely on Diplomacy</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Canberra, 26th] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt advocated today in the House of Representatives that there should be closer ties and joint action among the countries of the British Commonwealth. He believed that the autonomous territories are now fully grown and should bear more responsibility, cooperate closely, and actively assist the United Nations agencies. Evatt also said that Australia supports the United States' view that an atomic control system should be established first, and then the existing atomic bombs should be destroyed and the manufacture of atomic weapons should be terminated. On this point, Australia disagrees with the Soviet Union. Australia also supports the United States' acquisition of control over the former Japanese mandated islands in the Pacific. Australia also believes that the established European peace is not enough to guarantee lasting peace. Australia also believes that the democratization of Japan is the ultimate goal of the Far East peace treaty negotiations, and the treaty should stipulate the supervision of Japan's foreign trade, domestic industry, and general economy until the United Nations agency believes that Japan can handle its own affairs. Australia also advocates convening a Pacific conference as soon as possible so that countries that actively fought against Japan can participate to resolve most of the outstanding issues related to Japan. Finally, he also advocated the establishment of regional agencies in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific region at present to be responsible for the interests of the people in the region.</p>
<h3>Byrnes Said to be Appointed Ambassador to Britain</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 25th] White House Press Secretary Ross refused to confirm or deny the claim that Byrnes will be appointed Ambassador to Britain. According to the Washington Post today, it criticized the delay in appointing an ambassador to Britain, advocating that Byrnes be selected for this important position.</p>

<h3>Moscow Conference Agenda: China Issue Not Included; Dulles Appointed as Advisor to Marshall, Accompanying Him</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 25th] The State Department spokesman stated today that there are no specific plans to discuss the China issue at the upcoming Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. Consideration of the China issue has not been included in the conference agenda. However, the spokesman stated that Secretary of State Marshall may discuss many other issues during the conference, including the China issue, but these issues will not be discussed immediately during the conference.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 25th] Regarding all the difficult issues between the United States and the Soviet Union, it is reported by well-informed sources here that Secretary of State Marshall must arrive in Moscow and observe the situation of the negotiations before deciding whether to submit these issues to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference for discussion. As for the difficult issues between the United States and the Soviet Union, they include the following: (1) the Korean issue; (2) the Soviet Union's return of the U.S. Lend-Lease issue; (3) the Turkey/Dardanelles issue; and (4) the issue of disarmament and control of atomic energy. In any case, what is always discussed at the Moscow Conference will not be limited to the German issue. The relationship between Germany and Europe will also be discussed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 25th] The U.S. State Department today announced the list of U.S. representatives attending the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. The delegation is led by Secretary of State Marshall, with a total of more than eighty people, half of whom are secretaries and translators. The representatives include Murphy, political advisor to the U.S. military in Germany, and Clark, U.S. High Commissioner to Austria. John Foster Dulles, a New York lawyer and foreign policy advisor to former presidential candidate Dewey, has also been appointed as a special advisor. In addition, there are five political advisors, seven economic advisors, four military government advisors, five army and navy advisors, and legal advisors and assistants.</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 25th] Secretary of State Marshall commented on the Moscow Conference, stating that U.S. policy is still based on the obligations assumed by the U.S. at the Potsdam Conference, and according to the general policies that conform to the Potsdam Agreement. These policies were later fully explained by former Secretary of State Byrnes in his speech in Stuttgart, Germany, last year. When asked about the settlement of Lend-Lease materials, Marshall said there was no new information from the Soviet side. When further pressed on Foreign Minister Molotov's protest against Secretary of State Acheson's slip of the tongue, Marshall said he believed the matter was over.</p>
<h3>Four Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference: Declared Ended Yesterday</h3>
<p>German Peace Treaty Issue Submitted to Foreign Ministers Conference</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] The Four Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference this morning intended to discuss the Austrian peace treaty and immediately passed the report to be submitted to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, declaring the drafting work for the Austrian peace treaty to be completed. The report includes four parts: one is political clauses, one is military clauses, one is economic clauses, and the other is final clauses. All the clauses on which agreement has been reached (such as guarantees to prevent the merger of Germany and Austria, German property in Austria, and the issue of exiled people) will be submitted to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference for discussion. The Four Deputy Foreign Ministers also passed the proposal of the British representative Hooton, deciding to distribute the report to the governments of the Allied countries for filing. Regarding the request of the Yugoslav representative to attend the Moscow Conference, it was also decided to hand it over to the Foreign Ministers Conference for handling.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 25th Dispatch] The four will make the final decision. During a long five-hour meeting last night, the opinions of all parties failed to converge. The Soviet representative Gusev resolutely opposed granting other smaller allied nations greater rights when discussing the German peace treaty. Finally, the representatives decided to submit a report to the Four Foreign Ministers, with each of the four representatives submitting individual recommendations.</p>
<h3>Dispute Between Britain and the Soviet Union: Bevin to Propose a Comprehensive Settlement Plan to Stalin</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 26th] According to well-informed sources, when Foreign Secretary Bevin attends the Moscow Conference next month, he will present a comprehensive plan to Stalin for resolving major international disputes, including (1) the conclusion of an alliance between the three countries to ensure that Germany is permanently disarmed; (2) the establishment of a separate agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union, stipulating that neither country shall interfere in events within the other's sphere of influence, with Britain's sphere of influence being the Near East and the Middle East; and (3) the Soviet Union shipping timber, flax, cotton, and other goods to Britain, and Britain providing financial assistance to the Soviet Union. This point has never been mentioned before and will likely be discussed in detail in Moscow.</p>
<h3>On the Palestinian Political Situation: Bevin Criticizes U.S. Policy</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 25th] Foreign Secretary Bevin today accused the United States of adding obstacles to the Palestine issue during the Palestine debate in the House of Commons, undermining the British government's efforts to get the Jewish community to participate in the London Conference, which ultimately led to the failure of the conference. Bevin also said that the current number of Jews immigrating to Palestine has only increased fivefold in the history of Jewish immigration, and the Arabs have tacitly acknowledged that the government can no longer follow the immigration restrictions of the 1939 White Paper. Just as Britain was trying to negotiate an agreement to replace the White Paper, President Truman suddenly issued a statement on Jewish immigration in October, which caused the Jewish representatives to refuse to participate in the negotiations at the London Conference. He had asked U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes not to publish President Truman's statement, but Byrnes replied that if Truman did not publish it, the Republican Dewey would publish it. The British problem has obviously become a topic of the U.S. election. The United States should know that Britain is the trustee state of Palestine and bears all the responsibilities of a trustee state. Bevin also said that he was prepared to accept all the recommendations of the Anglo-American Palestine Committee report, but the United States only accepted the point of allowing 100,000 Jews to immigrate. He felt that based on humanitarian grounds, the Arab community might allow the immigration of 100,000 Jews, but the difficulty lies in the Jewish community's demand to establish a Jewish state. The Arab countries firmly oppose partition, and have stated that if partition is desired, they will sue Britain before the United Nations. Establishing two countries in Palestine is impossible. He felt that the Arabs should not be placed under Jewish rule, and the Jews should not be placed under Arab rule. Britain finally decided that trusteeship was not feasible. The failure was not in the trusteeship administration of Palestine, but in the failure of the international community to handle this entire issue in accordance with moral principles. Currently, if the idea of establishing a Jewish state can be abandoned, he is prepared to temporarily not appeal to the United Nations and continue to try.</p>
<p>U.S. Reaction</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 25th] New York Democratic Congressman Celler and the pro-Jewish newspaper "New York Post" both expressed indignation at British Foreign Secretary Bevin's public accusation against the United States in the House of Commons. There has been no reaction from the White House. Members of Congress were also surprised by Bevin's remarks. The American League for a Free Palestine has sent a telegram to President Truman, asking him to seriously protest to the British government. New York's evening newspapers all published Bevin's critical speech with headline titles.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Cheng Hosts Banquet for British Foreign Secretary Bevin</h3>
<p>Bevin Sings Loudly After Drinking</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 24th] The Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Cheng Tien-hsi, and his wife hosted a banquet at the embassy last night for British Foreign Secretary Bevin and his wife. After the meal, Bevin sang "Auld Lang Syne" in the most cheerful mood. Guests also included the Brazilian Ambassador (head of the diplomatic corps), the Soviet Ambassador and his wife, and the Egyptian Ambassador and his wife. (Translator's note: "Auld Lang Syne" is a well-known British song, written by the famous poet Burns. The famous film "Waterloo Bridge" used this as its theme song.)</p>
<h3>Stalemate in British-Egyptian Negotiations: Egypt Refuses Mediation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 26th] A senior official closely associated with Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy told reporters that Egypt could not accept the suggestion of Syria and Lebanon to mediate the deadlock in the British-Egyptian negotiations. Egypt has decided to appeal to the United Nations.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 25th] The Egyptian pyramids have always been considered to be the oldest to be the Pyramid of Djoser. However, recently, French archaeologist Lauer and Egyptian archaeologist El-Salam examined and researched the Dahshur Pyramid in the southern suburbs of Cairo and have obtained evidence to prove that the Dahshur Pyramid was built during the reign of Sneferu, the first king of the Fourth Dynasty of Egypt, making it older than the Pyramid of Djoser.</p>
<h3>British Houses of Parliament Debate Policy Towards India: Attlee Clarifies Stance: Responsibility for Defense Will Also Be Borne by the Indian People</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 25th] British Prime Minister Attlee reported on India in the House of Commons on the evening of the 25th, stating that when Britain fully transfers power to India by the end of June 1948, the responsibility for India's defense will also be handed over to the Indian people to be responsible for themselves. However, if India requests British assistance in times of emergency, the door to this request can still be reopened. "If India decides to continue as a British dominion, its status will be the same as the relationship between other dominions and the British government. If India decides to leave Britain, we will still be extremely concerned about India's future security. The British government will be prepared to discuss this matter with India. The responsibilities and obligations of both parties will be based on the Charter of the United Nations." At the same time, during the parliamentary debate on the India issue, Viscount Templewood said that the British decision to withdraw from India by a certain date was like a gambler's bet, with no turning back, which would cause the Indian government to suffer irreparable losses. He said that the Labor government's "New Deal" on the India issue seemed to be an unconditional surrender, not a policy of appeasement.</p>
<h3>U.S. Welcomes British Decision on India</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 20th] Secretary of State Dean Acheson issued a statement today, morally supporting Britain's announcement to withdraw from India on a regular basis and allowing it to complete its establishment as a free and independent country, and called on all political parties in India to unite. Acheson said: Internal strife in India may become a new source of international tension in a world that has just begun to restore peace. The U.S. government has clearly expressed its concern for the establishment of a fully autonomous government in India during a peaceful transition, and welcomes Britain's sincere efforts to promote Indian unity.</p>
<h3>International Control of Oil: Prevent Monopoly for Rational Distribution</h3>
<p>Some have suggested placing all of the world’s oil under United Nations control, but the private oil industry has strongly opposed this suggestion. A proposal from the U.S. State Department’s Petroleum Division to establish a world regulatory body, although modified, is still believed by oil companies to be possible. Most oil companies have decided to express their opposition. The U.S. petroleum industry, which holds 55 percent of the world’s oil resources, might cooperate with a purely advisory international organization. However, oil companies almost unanimously oppose a world agency that could determine U.S. oil policies or alter its oil-extraction rights.</p>
<p>The Anglo-Dutch Shell Oil Company, second in importance to the U.S., would also certainly oppose international control of oil.</p>
<p>Anglo-American Petroleum Agreement</p>
<p>The “Anglo-American Petroleum Agreement,” little more than a potential stepping stone for international oil control proposals, has already sparked debate among U.S. oilmen. The fundamental purpose of this agreement is to guarantee that people of all nations have access to sufficient oil in international trade, based on principles of fair competition, and to safeguard the interests of oil-producing nations. Delegations from both the U.S. and Britain are organizing a three-member committee to study postwar petroleum problems, technical improvements, trends in the oil industry, and the regulation of global supply and demand.</p>
<p>Ultimately, all parties involved in producing or using oil would be invited to join this agreement. The aforementioned committee would be expanded into an international petroleum committee, purely advisory in nature.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department’s petroleum experts are currently in Britain discussing steps for implementing the Anglo-American Petroleum Agreement and also discussing a more comprehensive plan. This plan aims to establish a global oil policy and set up an international oil control agency, perhaps under the jurisdiction of the United Nations.</p>
<p>World Oil Policy</p>
<p>According to the explanation of U.S. State Department petroleum experts, the main goal of a world oil policy is to prevent monopolies in the oil market, allow smaller companies to participate in the international market, and ensure that oil produced worldwide is rationally distributed to all countries based on principles of equality. One of the biggest goals is to ensure that all parties involved in oil-field development, including the people in the regions where the oil fields are located, can share in the benefits.</p>
<p>International Oil Agency</p>
<p>This world oil agency would be composed of experts from several countries, possibly affiliated with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It would consider political and economic issues related to international oil trade, study oil-extraction conditions worldwide, and guide governments and oil companies in taking appropriate measures to achieve mutual benefit and stabilize markets.</p>
<p>Additionally, this agency would have the authority to review and recommend re-examinations of oil-field extraction rights. Countries that have already obtained extraction rights could request that the agency review the consent of the assignees. Countries believing they are not obtaining sufficient supply could appeal to this agency.</p>
<p>U.S. oilmen believe this plan poses several dangers. They feel that an international agency affiliated with the United Nations could impose various restrictions on domestic U.S. oil transactions. The issue of the U.S. oil supply is also a concern for most oil companies. Some experts believe that U.S. exploration efforts are not quickly discovering new oil fields to replace those that are nearing exhaustion. They predict that in ten years, the U.S. will become a major oil-importing nation. They favor importing oil to bolster national strength.</p>
<p>U.S. Oil Company Attitude</p>
<p>However, U.S. oil companies insist that the U.S. has vast amounts of oil that have not yet been extracted, including the vast shale layers from which oil can be extracted. They oppose importing oil, fearing that an international agency with control would force large amounts of oil into the U.S.</p>
<p>Companies exploring oil fields abroad mostly oppose any plan that could call for re-examination of extraction rights. This is because these companies must spend huge sums of money exploring and developing an oil field before obtaining commercially viable quantities of oil. For example, U.S. oil companies in Venezuela spent US$470 million before exporting a single barrel of oil. They fear that international agencies will not adequately consider the costs incurred and risks taken in developing oil fields. They feel that when conflicts arise over extraction rights, it is better to seek protection from the U.S. government than to appeal to an international agency.</p>
<p>However, a few major entrepreneurs feel that establishing an international agency to control oil under the United Nations would be more beneficial than harmful. Assuming the Soviet Union participates in this agency, the Soviet Union would have to disclose facts related to oil transactions, possibly leading to a solution to the oil problems in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>U.S. State Department View</p>
<p>U.S. State Department experts believe that the power of the international agency would be purely advisory. However, oil companies fear that an advisory agency could overstep its bounds and assume regulatory authority. They are also concerned that a United Nations regulatory agency could provoke opposition to the Anglo-American Petroleum Agreement.</p>
<p>The fate of the Anglo-American Petroleum Agreement depends on the U.S. Senate. The agreement has been shelved in the Foreign Relations Committee for nearly a year without a meeting to review it, initially because the U.S. Congress had not yet made a decision on the loan to Britain, and subsequently because the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee was attending international conferences, making it impossible to convene a review meeting. It is expected that when the agreement is brought up for review in the Foreign Relations Committee, both supporters and opponents will actively mobilize, and when it is finally presented in the Senate, it will spark intense debate.</p>
<p>It is uncertain whether the Anglo-American Petroleum Agreement will pass in the Senate. However, if it is rejected, the hopes of those who favor international control of oil will suffer a serious blow. (Translated from "World Report" Weekly)</p>
<h3>Truman Issues Order Modifying U.S. Reciprocal Trade Policy: Protects Industry and Commerce, Prevents Dumping of Foreign Goods</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 25th] In an effort to dispel Republican lawmakers' criticism of his free trade policy, President Truman issued an executive order today to strengthen the protection of U.S. interests and prevent the dumping of cheap foreign goods into the U.S. This order was issued after consultation with Republican Senators Vandenberg and Millikin, and the reciprocal trade policy promoted by former Secretary of State Hull was greatly modified as a result. However, Truman also stated that the principles established by Hull in 1934 would still be followed. The presidential order stipulates: (1) All imported goods that are sufficient to "harm domestic manufacturers" must be restricted. (2) The President has the right to amend or abolish treaties signed with foreign countries that contain low tax rates that hinder U.S. industry and commerce. This provision was recommended by Vandenberg and Millikin. (3) Any trade agreement must include a "most favored nation" clause to ensure that U.S. exporters enjoy the same opportunities in foreign markets as any other country.</p>
<h3>Soviet Federal Assembly Passes Constitutional Amendments</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 26th] The local radio station announced that the constitutional amendments proposed by Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky have been passed by the Soviet Federal Assembly.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 24th] Vyshinsky, Chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Supreme Soviet Constitution, announced today at the Supreme Soviet meeting a plan to amend the constitution regarding the distribution of powers of each republic. The two most important points are to allow each Soviet republic to send its own diplomatic representatives and to have its own army. Other powers, such as the power to pass laws related to marriage and family and to issue medals and certificates, are only held by the Soviet Union. The eight-hour workday system implemented since 1940 is also included in the constitution. The Soviet Parliament also has the power to approve or revoke treaties. Men and women over the age of 18 have the right to elect members of the Supreme Soviet, and men and women over the age of 21 have the right to be elected.</p>
<h3>United Nations Observer in Korea Sends Telegram to Stalin with Questions</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 25th] Miss Hua Luyi, the Korean observer to the United Nations, sent a telegram to Marshal Stalin today, asking Stalin to confirm or deny the statement by Lieutenant General Hodge, commander of the U.S. military in South Korea, that the Soviet Union is training and arming 500,000 Koreans in North Korea. Miss Hua also told Stalin that in addition to lifting the artificial division at the 38th parallel in the U.S. and Soviet occupation zones, quickly unifying Korea and completing its independence would enhance deeper friendship between the United Nations and Korea. At the same time, Hua Luyi wrote to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, requesting that the United Nations send an investigative committee of the same nature as the Balkan investigation team to conduct an on-site investigation in Korea to verify Lieutenant General Hodge's report.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 25th] According to reliable sources, General Hodge, commander of the U.S. military district in Korea, said that despite the Soviet Union's various actions in North Korea, the U.S. military in Korea does not need to be increased further. The current level of 55,000 people can be maintained, or may be reduced further. Hodge also reiterated at the end of the Senate Army Committee meeting his previous condemnation at a press conference of the Soviet Union's conscription of troops in North Korea.</p>
<h3>Zhdanov Resigns as Chairman of the Soviet Nationalities Council</h3>
<p>Vacancy Succeeded by Parnonov</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 25th] Moscow Radio broadcast today that Marshal Zhdanov, a famous general in the Battle of Leningrad, has applied to resign from his position as Chairman of the Soviet Nationalities Council. Zhdanov's reason for resigning is said to be that he is overwhelmed by the heavy duties of his position. Zhdanov is a secretary of the Communist Party Central Political Bureau and a confidant of Marshal Stalin. European and American newspapers have even called him Stalin's successor.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 26th] After Zhdanov's resignation, the Soviet Nationalities Council unanimously elected Parnonov, representative of the Moscow region, to succeed him.</p>

<h3>Index Problem Has Been Instructed; Specific Measures Can Be Announced Today; Mayor and Social Affairs Bureau Chief Returned to Shanghai Last Night; Number of Rationed Items for Workers Expected to Increase</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Mayor Wu, after being summoned to Beijing the day before yesterday, returned here at 11 o'clock last night. Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Zhang Peter, Chief of the Public Relations Section, who accompanied him to Beijing, also returned in the same train. According to Mayor Wu, his trip to Beijing was purely to discuss the issue of the cost of living index with the central authorities, and a proper solution has now been negotiated and can be implemented within days. Mayor Wu took the express train to Beijing the night before last. After arriving in Beijing yesterday morning, he went to see President Song to discuss the issue of the cost of living index. After leaving, he went to the Chairman's residence to visit Chairman Chiang and had lunch with the Chairman.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the specific measures to solve the cost of living index issue are expected to be announced by Director Wu Kaixian today.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] Since the promulgation of the emergency measures plan and the freezing of the cost of living index, workers in Shanghai have sent Shui Xiangyun and others from the General Labor Union to Beijing to petition. Wu Kaixian, Director of the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, also came to Beijing specifically for this matter to ask for instructions. The reporter visited Huang Bode, Director of the Social Affairs Department, on the morning of the 26th and asked what countermeasures the government would take in this regard. He was told that the government's decision could not be easily changed, but the authorities would try to help solve the workers' difficulties in life. Shanghai workers originally enjoyed three kinds of in-kind supplies: rice, cloth, and coal. Now they are requesting that the number of rationed items be increased to be equal to that of public school teachers (i.e., from the current three to six). They are also requesting that the quantity be increased to the same number. The Bureau is currently considering this, or it may take a discount method to increase the types of rations, but the quantity will likely remain the same. The above refers to Shanghai and other places. As for the wages of workers in other designated cities for price assessment, the Social Affairs Department is drafting "Measures to Stabilize Wages," because if prices are managed to be stabilized, wages cannot be allowed to rise, causing wages to lead prices, creating a cyclical increase. These measures will be drafted within three or four days and submitted to the Executive Yuan and the National Defense Committee.</p>
<h3>Pan Public Exhibition Chairman in Beijing Discusses Emergency Measures Plan: Shanghai Business Community Provides Four Points Hoping the Government Adopts</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper's Nanjing office on the 26th] This newspaper's reporter recently interviewed Mr. Pan Gongzhan and asked about the situation in the Shanghai business community after the government announced the economic emergency measures plan. He said the following: After the announcement of the plan, it is hoped that it will be thoroughly implemented, and it is especially hoped that the government and the people can cooperate in its implementation. Even if there are difficulties, efforts should be made to remedy them to achieve the goal. As for the general legitimate business community in Shanghai, they offer several suggestions, urgently hoping that the government can adopt and implement them: (1) The plan should proceed simultaneously with production loans and should not be abandoned due to choking for fear of food. Production loans should not be stopped due to the gold and banknote turmoil. If only credit tightening and loan recovery are known, it will actually hinder production. If the goal is to prevent production loans from flowing into speculation, the method of the Nelson Wartime Production Bureau can be adopted, using the government's fixed fee for ordering goods from factories as loans. In this way, the government can obtain materials, and the business community can also obtain loans. Funds can flow into production, and loans can also be exchanged for real goods, without causing inflation. (2) Gold is settled in US dollars, that is, gold is exchanged for US dollars. Anyone holding gold and depositing it in the Central Bank will have a US dollar account recorded. These households will have priority in applying for imported goods, such as machinery and raw materials. The gold exchanged is not legal tender, so there is no inflation. And the imported goods are all necessities, which will not affect the rise in prices. (3) Strengthening the control of financial business has actually become the exclusive management of banks and money houses. This regulation is not entirely applicable to the Shanghai market, because most of the funds in Shanghai are still floating capital, staying in underground banks or bill discounting companies. If banks and money houses are tightened up as much as possible, the funds will flow even more into floating capital. The Central Bank's reserve deposits from various banks in Shanghai are only 40 billion, which shows that each bank can only absorb 200 billion deposits. The amount of funds in Shanghai is only one-tenth of this. Therefore, it is specially recommended to reasonably adjust the interest rate, so that floating capital can flow into banks and be invested in production. (4) Regarding the wage issue, the old method should be followed in January. From February onwards, the cost of living index will still be announced as usual, but wages can be paid with a discount based on the index ratio. The procedures can be simplified, and workers will suffer less. In terms of in-kind distribution, factories only have three types, which will also cause disputes, so it is hoped that the government can pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>The Machine Industry Union of Four Districts Invites the Press to Report</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Industrial Union of Machine Manufacturing Industry in the Fourth District of Shanghai held a press conference at its association on Pingliang Road yesterday afternoon, hoping that the government would restore the cost of living index for salary payments, or effectively restore the price index to the January level. If a satisfactory reply cannot be obtained before the 5th of next month, they will jointly organize a large-scale petition with trade unions from all industries in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Bartering: The Northeast Economic Council Sends a Letter to the Municipal Government for Adoption</h3>
<p>The Northeast Economic Committee recently sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Government, stating briefly: After the promulgation of the economic emergency measures plan, the prices in various places are determined by the competent authorities themselves. The situations in various places are different, and the prices are inevitably uneven. The Northeast produces soybeans and bean cakes, which are in great demand in the mainland, but the prices are lower than in the mainland, while the prices of other daily necessities, such as cloth, cotton yarn, flour, sugar, and tea, are higher than in the mainland. If there are no appropriate measures, materials will inevitably flow into the hands of hoarders, and citizens and farmers will not be able to obtain their actual benefits. If the above-mentioned goods are transported to the Northeast for barter, the association will handle the pricing at any time. After receiving the letter, the municipal government has sent a letter to the Social Affairs Bureau for handling.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Branch of the Industry Association Provides Suggestions for Stabilizing Prices and Promoting Production</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Branch of the National Industry Association hosted the press last night. Chairman Hu Boxiang reported first, stating briefly that the government's emergency measures were intended to suppress prices. The industrial community is most concerned about suppressing prices. However, to suppress the prices of manufactured goods, attention should first be paid to raw materials and wages. In terms of raw materials, the industrial community hopes to directly apply for foreign exchange and directly order foreign goods, without going through the hands of importers and their exploitation. In terms of wages, the industrial community believes that before the in-kind distribution method is effectively implemented, the cost of living index method should continue to be maintained, otherwise, labor unrest will inevitably continue to be caused. Secretary-General Tian Heqing reported, briefly stating that the government's emergency measures are intended to suppress prices, and the prohibition of gold and banknote trading is actually a method of abandoning the root and pursuing the tip. Intending to stabilize wages and freeze the cost of living index is even more like burying one's head in the sand. If the government really wants to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, it should pay attention to how to promote production. To promote production, the following points must be resolved: (1) The factory's funds—to make domestic floating capital tend to production businesses, high-interest loans must be banned, and the method is to ban underground money houses. (2) National banks provide low-interest loans to Minfeng Bank, and then private banks lend to factories engaged in production. The total amount should be larger than production loans, and the procedures should be simple. (3) Raw materials—the government should allocate raw materials at fair prices to private factories, and should not be limited to state-owned factories. (4) Wages—the cost of living index was originally not set for wages, but in the current situation, it is still a kind of reference for paying wages, and the in-kind distribution system actually hinders the freedom of salaried people to use their salaries, and the procedures are extremely cumbersome. Therefore, the government should still announce the cost of living index every month, and factories can adopt either the cost of living index system or the in-kind distribution system, allowing them to do as they please. If not, the government can stipulate the minimum wage figure in various places for compliance. (5) Market—now the foreign market is equivalent to being frozen. If there are no appropriate measures, the market outside the customs will be monopolized by Japan. (6) Factory Equipment—At present, the equipment of various factories is outdated, but if the above problems cannot be solved, the factories will not be able to improve the equipment.</p>
<p>The association held a membership meeting on February 19 and passed measures to stabilize prices and promote production, and suggested them to the government, hoping that the government could adopt the opinions of the industrial community to seek the development of the entire production business.</p>
<h3>Municipal Public Works Bureau and Land Administration Bureau Send Letters to the Senate to Add Budgets</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Works Bureau and the Land Administration Bureau formally sent letters to the Senate yesterday, stating that due to price fluctuations and rising foreign exchange rates, additional budget amounts are required. The Public Works Bureau needs 20.686.042.276 billion yuan, and the Land Administration Bureau needs 2.717.295.200 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>After the Economic Supervisory Group Was Reorganized, an Economic Investigation Network Was Established, Thoroughly Investigating the Gold Rush: The Results of the Investigation Will Have a Surprising Report</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The second group affairs meeting of the Economic Supervision Group was held at the Garrison Headquarters at 10 am yesterday. The chief of the group, Xuan, and all members, secretaries, and group leaders attended. The following resolutions were made: (1) The investigation report on the causes of the financial market unrest in this city should be completed by the end of this month as much as possible. Any persons suspected of manipulation and speculation will be listed together with the facts and reported to Chairman Jiang for approval. (2) From March 1, it will be reorganized into an "Economic Investigation Network". The work will be based on the economic emergency measures plan passed by the Supreme National Defense Conference, assisting the competent authorities to be responsible for stabilizing prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods. It will focus its efforts on monitoring daily necessities, and may adopt confidential methods externally. If action is necessary, the relevant units will be commanded by the Songhu Preparation Headquarters to execute.</p>
<p>[Another report] The Economic Supervision Group's work of thoroughly investigating the gold rush will be completed in the next few days. Xu Youzuo, the leader of the group's gold and banknote group, told reporters yesterday that the results of this thorough investigation will be completely unexpected when they are announced in the future. As for how it will be unexpected, he firmly refused to reveal it. However, according to another source from a relevant responsible person, there are about ten people suspected of being involved in the gold rush case, including important personnel from economic and financial institutions.</p>
<p>Studying the Causes and Investigating the Central Bank Again</p>
<p>It is also reported that when the Economic Supervision Group was first established, it studied the causes of the gold rush. In addition to the large circulation of year-end bonuses and rewards on the market and the concurrent lending of production loans, the Central Bank's cessation of secret sales was also an important factor in promoting the rise in gold prices. Therefore, whether the Central Bank, which is responsible for stabilizing gold prices, handled it properly in this turmoil is also one of the investigation targets of the Economic Supervision Group. Xu Youzuo, the leader of the gold and banknote group, and He Hanwen, a member of the Supervisory Committee, went to the Central Bank again yesterday to review the account books. In addition, personnel were sent to investigate the safety deposit boxes of various banks.</p>
<p>Zheng Jiemin and Others Returned to Beijing One After Another</p>
<p>General Zheng Jiemin, who was stationed in this city and responsible for thoroughly investigating the gold rush, will complete the thorough investigation work. According to the reporter's exploration on the afternoon of the 26th, Zheng has scheduled to return to Beijing by night train last night to visit the highest authorities and report everything. In addition, the four supervisory committee members who were sent to Shanghai have also completed their missions. Zhang Qingzhen and Gu Fengxiang returned to Beijing the night before, and He Hanwen and Wan Lan returned to Beijing in the afternoon after investigating the Central Bank's account books.</p>
<h3>China Industrial Bank Illegally Buys and Sells US Dollars, Reaching 430,000 US Dollars</h3>
<p>Yang Guowei, a member of the gold and banknote group of the Economic Supervision Group, found China Industrial Bank illegally buying and selling US dollars, amounting to 410,000 US dollars, yesterday afternoon, together with personnel from the Audit Department of the Ministry of Finance. The group has now reported the case to the superiors for approval.</p>
<h3>A Citizen Suggests That the Japanese Staying in Shanghai Should Be Sent Back Quickly, and Industrial Institutions Should Not Employ Them</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Citizen Li Hanwen recently suggested to the Municipal Senate that public and private industrial institutions in my country should not employ Japanese and should be sent back quickly. Those who must be retained should also be strictly managed and thoroughly examined, and Japanese technicians who hang up their signs without actually doing anything and the industrial institutions that collude with them should be severely punished, so as not to be ridiculed by the government for being confused and to prevent the hidden dangers for our nation. According to Li Hanwen, most of the Japanese expatriates staying in Shanghai claim to be technicians. In fact, there are countless such personnel among the Chinese, and there are also non-technical personnel mixed in. The reason why they are unwilling to return to their country is nothing more than: (1) In the past, they relied on the power of their country to use unscrupulous elements in China to divide and conquer in order to preserve their property, wait for the opportunity, and try to return fully loaded. (2) Staying in Shanghai is to protect the property of Japanese expatriates who have returned to their country first. (3) The Japanese are mostly cunning. Those with small craft skills go everywhere to solicit Chinese cooperation in business operations, hoping to make huge profits. (4) They hide in the city or suburbs, live with Chinese women, and live comfortably and indulgently, using this to cover up their attempts to engage in illegal activities. The Municipal Senate will forward the above-mentioned opinions to various industrial institutions and organizations for adoption.</p>
<h3>Advocating National Goods, Propaganda First: The Municipal Party Department Formulates Measures</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Party Department of this city advocates national goods and has specially drafted the following measures for the propaganda conference: (1) It is suggested that the central government stipulate a "National Goods Day" and hold expanded propaganda activities on this day every year thereafter. (2) Hold a large conference on "National Goods Day", invite celebrities to give speeches, and use radio broadcasts. (3) Compile various ditties for "Advocating National Goods" and mobilize the entertainment industry to sing them. (4) Mobilize various national goods manufacturers to hold a large parade to promote national goods. (5) Mobilize various national goods manufacturers to give discounts to patrons on "National Goods Day". (6) Send letters to various newspapers and magazines to publish special issues, writing articles to explain and promote the significance of advocating national goods. (7) Hold a national goods exhibition. (8) Send letters to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to mobilize various stores to display as many national goods samples as possible in their windows.</p>
<h3>Land Administration Bureau Office Meeting Decides to Step Up the Collection of Deed Tax</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Land Administration Bureau held an office meeting yesterday afternoon and decided to step up the collection of deed tax (the tax rate is 6% of the selling price).

At a time when the Sino-Philippine commercial treaty negotiations have stalled, McNutt's visit to China has attracted much attention from all walks of life. When reporters asked McNutt about the mission of this trip, he firmly refused to publish it, saying that he must first have a meeting with the US Consul General. McNutt is scheduled to go to Beijing today or tomorrow to see Chairman Jiang.</p>
<h3>British Public Bus Employees Prepare to Make Seven Demands: A Delegation Will Go to the Social Affairs Bureau to Petition</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The British Public Bus Company in this city ceased operations after the outbreak of the Pacific War, and all employees remained on unpaid leave. After the victory, more than 2,000 unemployed workers demanded to resume work. After mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, the company agreed to give priority to hiring them. Until recently, the company published a notice saying that it had decided to liquidate and was hiring a foreign accountant to liquidate. The employees then elected Zhang Qingxiang, Tang Yiqing, and others to form a delegation of seventeen people, who will petition the Social Affairs Bureau in the next few days, preparing to make seven demands: (1) All salaries and wages should be paid from the date the company temporarily suspended operations until the date of liquidation. (2) After the company is liquidated, the retirement funds of all employees should be returned. (3) After the company is liquidated, relief funds should be issued to all employees.

<h3>Receiving Coal Allocation Without Starting Work: Briquette Factories Deceive and Seek Profits</h3>
<p>Qian Yaonan, the owner of the Jinghua Briquette Factory in this city, has received two coal allocations from the Fuel Management Office of this city, totaling 271 tons, but has not started work so far, which is obviously a means of deceiving and seeking profits. Zhen Haigen and other workers from the factory specially reported to the Shanghai Coal and Firewood Vocational Union, and also reported that the Nanyang and Dongfang factories were also colluding with the factory to receive coal allocations.

<h3>Shen Siliang Tried for the Third Time: The Defense Lawyer Presents Counter-Evidence: The Four Words "Celebrities Outside the Association" Are Beneficial to the Defendant</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Shen Siliang, the former president of St. John's University, was tried for the third time yesterday at the High Court on suspicion of being a traitor. Professors and students from the school crowded the second criminal court to listen, and there was no space left. Those who arrived later stood and listened. Shen is fifty-two years old, from Ningbo, his hair is already gray, he is wearing a gray woolen coat and a floral scarf, he puts on glasses when reading documents, and takes off his glasses when answering, and his attitude is quite calm.</p>
<p>Shen Siliang claimed: The evidence provided in the reply from the Military Statistics Bureau was all extracted from the false reports at that time, and there was actually no such thing. However, because he was under Japanese rule at that time, he had no way to defend himself. I never participated in the Anti-British and American Association, how could I be a director? I never gave a speech on stage. The position of chairman of the false Shanghai Sports Association was because I had more than 20 years of history in the sports field and was publicly elected by the sports community. There were both Chinese and foreign teams in the association, and I never solicited donations from outside, and I had nothing to do with Ding Mocun. I never participated in the two invitations from the enemy ambassador Mitsuaki and the traitor Wang Jingwei. I never participated in the false New National Movement Promotion Committee. Chen Gongbo put my name in as a standing director of the false Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Shanghai Branch without asking for my consent. I didn't even know the meaning of the false Shanghai Citizen's Day Movement Committee, let alone participate in the organization. I once served as a consulting committee member of the false Shanghai Municipal Government Consulting Committee, but that was just a public opinion organ representing the people. There was no "Education Committee" in the association, let alone a convener. I was neither a member nor an initiator of the false Shanghai Citizen's Welfare Association. Finally, it was said that the "Shen Bao" yearbook and the New China Handbook during the period of the fall were all presided over by Chen Binhe, and the materials in them were completely unreliable.</p>
<p>Then, the defense lawyer Hong Shihao presented a piece of powerful evidence, which was the "Shen Bao" on January 26, 1943, the content of which was to solicit loans from the Anti-British and American Association and ask "celebrities outside the association" Shen Siliang and others to give speeches. Lawyer Hong emphasized: "Since they are called 'celebrities outside the association', it can be seen that the defendant did not serve as a director of the association, which is actually a powerful piece of counter-evidence." Then, lawyer Mi Xitong stood up to defend and requested bail and permission to see family members.</p>
<p>Judge Xiao ordered: This case still needs to investigate various pieces of evidence from the Shen Bao archives. The hearing will be rescheduled. The request for bail can be submitted in writing and decided by the collegiate panel. The defendant is allowed to see family members and then returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Coffee Shop and Dance Hall Suffered a False Alarm; Songshan Police Chief Apologizes Publicly – It Turns Out to Be a Realistic Anti-Theft Drill</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper's News) Yesterday afternoon around 6 PM, the Songshan Precinct held an anti-theft drill. They ordered plainclothes officers Zhang Keting, Zhang Wenqi, and Hao Wende to impersonate robbers, and police officer Li Zunian to dress up as the victim, carrying a large package of legal tender. He entered the Nanjing Coffee Shop, and after being seated by a waiter, he placed the cash on the table. Soon after, the three fake robbers followed him inside. Two of the robbers used guns to threaten him, while the third robber snatched the legal tender and fled to the nearby Hongyun Lane Fule Courtyard to seek pleasure from prostitutes. The other two robbers rushed into the Xinhua Dance Hall to dance with the dancers. Over five minutes later, the precinct chief Song Tingjun personally led section chief Shen Zuoluo, staff member Zhang Jingfang, and the entire judicial section, wearing chainmail vests and carrying live ammunition, to the scene to investigate, asking customers about the robbery. The crowd reported that one robber had fled into the Fule Courtyard, and the other two had run into the Xinhua Dance Hall. Upon Chief Song's order, the police officers shifted their targets and surrounded the Hongyun Lane and Xinhua Dance Hall. A portion of the officers bravely charged in to search, and after half an hour, they finally captured the three robbers one after another. Afterwards, Chief Song jumped onto the bandstand, first offering an apology, and then explaining the profound significance of the anti-theft drill, hoping for cooperation between the citizens and the police. Because the situation was tense at the time and the performance was realistic, the dancers and patrons present were given quite a fright.</p>

They arrested two suspects on the spot and found a small handgun with the number 35142, a magazine, five bullets, and a gun holster on top of the wardrobe in the room. They took the suspects and the evidence back to the bureau.</p>
<p>One of them confessed, giving his name as Yao Zhenghua, 21 years old, from Huaian, residing at 52 Madeli Road, Mahuo Road.

On the 16th, he met his accomplice Yao Zhenghua at the Gao Feng Dance Hall in the Great World. After dancing, they went to the Oriental Hotel, room 608, to solicit prostitutes.

<h3>Reader Consultation – Legal Questions</h3>
<p>(1) Unmarried Pregnancy</p>
<p>Jin San asks: I have several legal questions and would like to request answers: (1) Miss A (19 years old) was seduced by Mr. B (22 years old) after their engagement, resulting in an unmarried pregnancy, and then abandoned by Mr. B. What crimes has Mr. B committed under the law? Can Miss A request alimony? (2) Miss A intends to dissolve the engagement with Mr. B, but Mr. B avoids meeting her. She negotiated with Mr. B's father, who said that he had severed relations with his son. What legal method should she use? (3) If Miss A cohabits with Mr. C before completing the termination of the engagement, does she commit adultery?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Fu Kuangling's Answer] (1) Mr. B's seduction of his fiancée Miss A, depending on the circumstances, may constitute the crime of harming public morals, harming the family, or infringing on freedom under criminal law. If Mr. B now ignores Miss A, and if Miss A has not become a member of Mr. B's family, or there is no special agreement for support, then Mr. B does not commit the crime of abandonment, but Miss A can request compensation for damages, rather than request alimony. (2) Since Mr. B is of age and has independent capacity for action, negotiations with his father cannot be used. When filing a lawsuit, if Mr. B's whereabouts are unknown, you can apply to the court for public service of the summons regarding the request to dissolve the engagement. (3) Miss A has not yet married Mr. B, so she cannot be immediately considered to have a spouse. If she cohabits with Mr. C before the termination of the engagement, it does not constitute the crime of adultery under Article 239 of the Criminal Code, and Mr. B has no right to sue. However, Mr. B can dissolve the engagement according to the provisions of Article 976, paragraph 1, item 7 of the Civil Code.</p>
<p>(2) Transferring Affection to Another</p>
<p>Wang Xuejun asks: Mr. A is already married, but is now in love with Ms. B, his classmate, and has already had sexual relations with her. Now Mr. A and Ms. B wish to live together until their hair turns white. What legal conflicts arise from this behavior of Mr. A and Ms. B? (2) Can Ms. B break away from her family to marry Mr. A?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Fu Kuangling's Answer] (1) Mr. A, having a spouse, commits the crime of adultery with Ms. B under Article 239 of the Criminal Code. Only the spouse can sue. If Mr. A and Ms. B formally marry, they commit the crime of bigamy, which is also subject to prosecution upon complaint. (2) If Ms. B is an adult over the age of 20, there is no need to break away from her family, and her parents cannot interfere with her behavior.</p>

<h3>Ambassador Stuart Gives a Speech to Students in Guangzhou – Believes China Needs Students with Various Types of Training</h3>
<p>(American News Agency, Guangzhou, 25th) Ambassador Stuart gave a speech here today to university and middle school students as follows: "Guangzhou has been liberated from the clutches of the invaders, and has once again risen as a center of historical, commercial, international contact, and political innovation. I am truly delighted to revisit this old place, and words cannot express my feelings. The past events of the revolutionary movement, especially those related to the founding father of the nation, float in my mind one after another, because we are now gathered in this Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall. I am also deeply moved to face the Chinese students, because you all represent great potential.</p>
<p>Victory in the War of Resistance Attributed to Students</p>
<p>I remember that when the May Fourth Student Anti-Japanese Movement occurred in 1919, I began to reside in Beijing. Later, whether I was in Beijing or elsewhere, I worked closely with the students, who were full of patriotic enthusiasm and awakened the people to jointly resist foreign threats. I believe that the Chinese people, regardless of hardship, loss, disaster, and death, embarked on the road of resistance against Japan, mostly due to the national consciousness awakened by these student movements, which realized the teaching of Mencius that "those who know first awaken those who know later, those who are aware first awaken those who are aware later." In order for China to engage in resistance in the initial four years, and finally achieve victory after four years following the Pearl Harbor Incident, the achievement of victory should be largely attributed to Chinese students.</p>
<p>Future Activities Focus on Construction</p>
<p>Therefore, regarding the ways in which I believe that current Chinese students can express the same patriotic enthusiasm in useful activities, I would like to frankly state my views to you, because I firmly believe that today's students' patriotic enthusiasm is no less than that of the students who resisted foreign aggression in the past. China's current problem is internal, and I believe that all future activities should focus on constructive rather than destructive work. Previously, revolutionary movements against the Manchu Qing, Japan, or any other crisis, all involved destructive agitation, which was unavoidable. However, I believe that the era of overthrowing, resisting, destroying, or engaging in other kinds of negative agitation has now passed. Having witnessed the destruction of cities and the suffering of the people, I am increasingly aware of the importance of dedicating myself to constructive work.</p>
<p>Future Citizens Need Training</p>
<p>In the near future, China needs students with various types of training (including applied sciences, social or government activities, and other useful public services). Therefore, you must study hard, and you must remember that the training you are currently receiving should be suitable for the special cause that will allow you to maximize your patriotic goals. At the same time, you can always think about national issues. I firmly believe that students should be interested in current politics. You will become citizens of the future. Unless citizens actively participate in the government, there will never be a good democratic government. The new constitution allows you freedom of speech, press, and assembly. You live in a very important era: first, a truly democratic government is being actively planned in your country's long history. From an American standpoint, we naturally feel a deep interest in this promising development in China. To use the words of the American Declaration of Independence, "this is a government derived from the consent of the governed," which is the immortal motto that guided the birth of our country. Behind this idea lies a philosophy that any change in government or society, no matter how necessary and urgent, if it has been obtained with the consent of those concerned, its results will always be very effective, very complete, and less destructive. In other words, changes in society or government are promoted by education rather than by force or dictatorship. As Mencius said, "To subdue men by force is not to subdue their hearts, to subdue men by virtue makes them pleased in their hearts and sincerely submit."</p>
<p>Universal Education and Wise Leadership</p>
<p>A democratic government requires universal education and wise leadership. Most importantly, it needs leaders and citizens who abandon selfish thoughts and serve the people as a prerequisite. When you nurture these noble ideals and generously share these principles with your compatriots, I believe that you will gain a way to express your patriotic enthusiasm, the effect of which will be far greater than that of misguided revolutionary agitation, and will be adapted to the current needs of the people.</p>

<h3>GuanggHan Dismissal of Teacher Dispute – Reasonable Solution Expected Within Days</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper News) The private Guanghan Primary School in this city held a reception for the press yesterday regarding the dispute over the dismissal of teachers Sha Zhizhen and Li Jie. According to the principal of the school, Gao Zhengxiang: (1) Sha and Li often ordered students to watch the clock during class, which affected students' emotions in class. (2) Class often changed to free activities. (3) There was too little music teaching material. (4) There were many errors in grading. (5) They were often late. The principal also stated: Sha and Li's claim that their dismissal was due to their request for the school's finances to be made public was completely untrue, because teachers' salaries accounted for more than 73% of tuition fees, which exceeded the Education Bureau's regulations of 70%.</p>
<p>Furthermore: The Primary School Teachers' Joint Training Association had conducted mediation for this purpose and proposed a solution, which was not accepted by the principal. Yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m., more than 10 representatives were sent to the Municipal Education Bureau to express their opinions, hoping for impartial handling. The Education Bureau's National Education Division Chief Zhu agreed to make a fair and reasonable solution within days.</p>
<h3>Coordinating with the Implementation of the Constitution, Promoting National Education: Ministry of Education Sets Twenty-Three Research Topics</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 26th] To promote national education and coordinate with the implementation of the Constitution, the Ministry of Education has set twenty-three research questions related to national education, including cultural education issues in the Constitution's basic national policies, how to improve national education, and research questions on improving local education administration. All provincial and municipal education bureaus have been ordered to promptly solicit opinions from their education administrative personnel, compile and organize them, and formulate answers to be submitted to the Ministry by March 20 of this year for selection and implementation. The research questions are listed below:</p>
<p>Universal Enrollment of Children: Planning for Additional Grades and Schools</p>
<p>(A) Research questions related to the articles on national education in Chapter 13, the Basic National Policy Education and Culture Section, of the Constitution: (1) According to the provision that "all citizens shall have equal opportunity to receive education," all citizens, regardless of gender, residence, or family economic status, should have the opportunity to receive basic education. To realize this provision, plans should be made based on the existing schools, grades, the number of children in school, and the number of children not in school, to universally establish schools, add grades, or promote a tutor system, etc., to educate children who are not in school. A compulsory education system should also be implemented, along with free tuition and the provision of books for poor children. Each province, city, and county should plan based on its actual situation, how to establish schools and add grades on a yearly basis, how to raise funds, what difficulties exist, and how to solve them? (2) According to the provision that "children of school age from six to twelve years old shall uniformly receive basic education," all children should receive six years of education in principle. That is, all current national schools should be changed to a six-year system, similar to central national schools, and central national schools should be further strengthened to maintain their leading position. Therefore, teachers and funding must be planned in advance.

How should each province effectively promote city and county education funding to reach at least 35%, and how should those that have already reached this minimum proportion increase it on a yearly basis? Also, if the education funding of each county reaches the minimum quota, is it sufficient? (7) According to the provision that "education and cultural foundations and industries established according to law shall be protected," how should specific measures be stipulated to protect existing national school foundations and local education industries?

<h3>The Municipal Bureau of Education Held a Meeting Yesterday to Discuss the Bidding for Desks and Chairs</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education held a discussion meeting at 4 p.m. yesterday to discuss the bidding for desks and chairs. Attendees included Li Ximou, Zhou Feicheng, Lin Jianxiang, Zhu Xiying, Huang Zhicheng, Lu Guanliu, Huang Xincun, Su Wanfu, Ge Chengxun, Wang Qichang, Hu Huaitian, etc. Chairman Li Ximou reported the purpose of the meeting and expressed his opinions, stating that Wang Qichang and others had accused the bureau of fraud in the current bidding for the manufacture of desks and chairs to the Municipal Council, and published it in the newspapers. For the sake of prudence, the bureau is asking each representative to express their opinions on whether to re-tender or to proceed with the original plan. However, if the original plan is still followed, whether it violates legal procedures, please representatives carefully consider and express their opinions, and then begin the discussion. The representatives successively expressed their opinions as follows: Zhou Feicheng asked the audit office when opening the bid, whether the lowest price can be considered unqualified, and the second bid can be selected; Lin Jianxiang said that the lowest bid is best selected when opening the bid, but when the lowest bid is considered unqualified, the second bid can be selected, and can be manufactured according to the price of the second bid. Zhu Xiying's opinion is the same as that of Representative Lin, and believes that the opening of the bid is legal. Su Wanfu and others believe that the equipment of Yang Heji's workshop with the lowest bid is too simple, and they are deeply afraid that they will not be able to deliver the goods on time. Judging from the historical credit, it is reliable for Zhuochunji to manufacture it. It was resolved that: (1) It was decided to proceed with the original plan and hand it over to Zhuochunji School Furniture to manufacture it, and no re-bidding will be held; (2) Wang Qichang and others should be asked to state the reasons for the accusation. Then Wang Qichang stated, (1) denied accusing the Municipal Council of fraud, and can directly investigate with the Municipal Council, (2) had prepared a document to the Municipal Council to report the course of opening the bid, because Zhuochunji obstructed it at the time of opening the bid, and Zhuochunji was awarded the bid this time, and it was considered unsatisfactory. After discussion, it was believed that Wang Qichang had denied accusing the Municipal Bureau of Education of fraud, and the Municipal Bureau of Education did not intend to pursue it.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Education Society Recently Organized a Taiwan Provincial Education Delegation; Twelve People Including Chen Heqin Were Elected as Members; Scheduled to Depart in Mid-March for a Month</h3>

<h3>Shen Yizhen and Others Proposed to the Municipal Bureau of Education to Strengthen the National Education Demonstration Zone; Four Measures Were Formulated Based on the Experimental Results</h3>
<p>Shen Yizhen, director of the Second National Education Demonstration Zone of Shanghai, and Sheng Langxi, deputy director, submitted a report to the Municipal Bureau of Education, proposing four specific measures to strengthen the National Education Demonstration Zone as follows: (1) Increase the authority of the National Education Demonstration Zone Office: The National Education Demonstration Zone Office is an affiliated organization of the Municipal Bureau of Education and has the mission of demonstrating national education in the city. To accomplish this mission, its authority must be increased to facilitate promotion. If it functions in parallel with the Central National School, the promotional power will be weakened invisibly, and how can the work be carried out smoothly? To increase the promotional power, it is possible to stipulate that the "National Education Demonstration Zone Office" has the power to supervise the schools under its jurisdiction and change personnel. It is hoped that through administrative power, the district-school structure can be improved and the demonstration function can be exerted. (2) Clarify the guidance tasks of the Demonstration Zone Office and the Central National School: The focus of the work in the National Education Demonstration Zone is on guidance and research, and its task is to guide the schools under its jurisdiction, which is the same as the Central National School. If the two parties provide guidance in parallel, there will be no specific responsibility, and there will be many conflicts. Those who are being guided will be overwhelmed and exhausted, resulting in futile efforts. To increase the efficiency of guidance, is it possible to stipulate that schools within the district should be directly guided by the office, and schools outside the district should be guided by the Central National School? (3) Improve the qualifications of the principals and teachers of the Central National School and increase their remuneration: The Central National School is a model for national schools throughout the district, and the Central National School in the National Education Demonstration Zone is even more important. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the qualifications of the principals and teachers of the Central National School, otherwise, how can they lead the schools in the district and fulfill their duties of guidance and research? To enrich the content of the Central National School, is it possible to stipulate that the principal of the Central National School must have a qualification from a normal college or a university education department, and the teachers of the Central National School must have graduated from a senior high school normal course or a normal college and have served as elementary school teachers for more than two years with achievements? The base salary should be increased according to their qualifications, equivalent to the treatment of secondary school teachers, in order to attract talents. (4) The regular operating expenses of the National Education Demonstration Zone should be directly distributed by the Education Bureau: The procedures for receiving education funds in the city are very complicated, without a fixed time and time-consuming, and the operating expenses must be collected directly from the city bank by a third party after use, which is especially troublesome, and the impact on the progress of the cause is huge. It is found that the determination of this method may have considerable reasons, but the general method may not be applicable to education. To facilitate the progress of education, the regular operating expenses of the National Education Demonstration Zone can be directly distributed by the Municipal Education Bureau to simplify the procedures for receiving funds and facilitate the progress of the cause. The above four points are the experimental results of the work of the colleagues in the district in the past six months. If they are adopted and implemented, they may be effective in the future. Whether they are appropriate, please review.</p>

<h3>Hengyisheng Protest Case</h3>
<p>The Adjudication Committee Judged</p>
<p>The Original Result of the Match Stands</p>
<p>The Adjudication Committee of the Football Committee held its second meeting yesterday to hear the case of Hengyisheng's protest against the Football Committee's judgment on the Hengyisheng vs. Jingwu match on January 19. The discussion and resolution are as follows:</p>
<p>Hengyisheng Team protested against the Football Committee's judgment that "when Hengyisheng played against Jingwu on January 19, Hengyisheng players did not submit photos, and players registered in two teams participated in the match, violating the association rules. The team was penalized for abandoning the game, and Jingwu won 1-0." After reviewing the facts, (1) it was proved that the team had verbally notified the registration that the photos of the players of the previous Piye team should be changed and posted on the registration form. Because the registrar failed to do so, it was discovered in the fifth game that four players registered without photos had been registered. The negligence of the office caused this misunderstanding and should be forgiven. (2) Hengyisheng Team should be responsible for improper management for players registered in two teams participating in the competition. Based on the above reasons, the judgment of the case is as follows: (1) Maintain the original result of the game (1-1). Hengyisheng Football Team was penalized for improper management and given a warning. (2) The Football Committee should notify all Group B and C members that the team manager should be responsible for the photos of the players registered in the future. If it is found that the players have no photos during the verification, the players without photos will be penalized as unregistered.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Soccer News - Special Silver Shield Replay - Star Island Draws With British Army - The Best Game of the Season</h3>
<p>[Our Hong Kong Dispatch] This year's Special Silver Shield competition is being held separately for Division A and Division B. After several weeks of fierce elimination matches, the situation is becoming clear.</p>
<p>This year, the strength of foreign teams in Hong Kong is not strong. In Division A, only Golden Crown and 4/5 Battalion have made it to the semi-finals. In Division B, only Navy B has qualified for the semi-finals. Chinese teams Star Island A and B, and South China A and B are also on the list of contenders. Guanghua Association also defeated Navy A to participate in the semi-finals.</p>
<p>According to schedule - Saturday (February 22nd)</p>
<p>Star Island B vs. Navy B; 2:15 PM - South China Stadium</p>
<p>Star Island A vs. 4/5 Battalion; 4:00 PM - South China Stadium</p>
<p>Weekend (February 23rd)</p>
<p>South China B vs. Police; 2:15 PM - Hong Kong Club Stadium</p>
<p>South China A vs. Guanghua; 4:00 PM - Hong Kong Club Stadium</p>
<p>Division B Takes the Stage, No Winner Emerges</p>
<p>Today (Saturday), the Star Island brothers first took the stage at the South China Stadium to face the foreign soldiers. Before 2:00 PM,嘉山道 was crowded with people eager to watch the two Chinese-foreign dramas.</p>
<p>At 2:15 PM, Division B took the stage first. Star Island B faced Navy B. The former is the invincible champion of the league, and the latter is also a strong team in Division B. This meeting is an elimination match, and both sides want to win the final.</p>
<p>After 90 minutes of intense battle, Star Island B won the first half with a score of 2-1, but lost the second half with a score of 1-2. As a result, they were forced to a 3-3 draw by the foreign sailors. After extra time, neither side scored, so they had to schedule another decisive battle. The whole match was tightly contested and no less exciting than any Division A match. It was truly a good game.</p>
<p>Injured Divine Leg Affects Forward</p>
<p>After the Division B match, Division A took the stage. The Golden Army 4/5 Battalion, about to be discharged and return home, really wanted to defeat Star Island for honor before leaving. Therefore, before the war, they worked hard for three weeks. The game was well-organized, making it difficult for Star Island to cope. The entire team performed above its usual standard, and the draw with Star Island was not a fluke.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Star Island, since the injury of the team's soul "Divine Leg" Feng Jingxiang, the forward advancement is not as flexible as before. In today's battle, the defense has done its best to ensure that they did not lose. There is nothing to say, only the performance of the forward line was not ideal, and they could not win.</p>
<p>This match was also played in extra time. The entire match lasted 110 minutes and was full of excitement. It was the best game of the season.</p>
<p>The battle began with the referee Deng Shitu's silver whistle. The two sides lined up as follows:</p>
<p>(Star Island Club)</p>
<p>Yu Yaode Tan Jiangbai Hou Rongsheng Feng Kunsheng Xu Jingcheng Wu Qixiang Cao Qiuting Li Zhaorong Zhang Jinhai Liu Songsheng He Yingfen</p>
<p>(4/5 Battalion)</p>
<p>Taylor</p>
<p>Dia Li G辰 Bun Li Zhi Patton Kan Bu Lu</p>
<p>Wooding Lianlushi Gao Luotuo De Ge Nilu</p>
<p>Upon contact, Star Island launched a lightning attack, but to no avail. The two sides fought in a mixed battle for 20 minutes with mutual attacks and defenses. At 23 minutes, Yingfen finally got the ball and advanced quickly from the right. Seeing a cross, the two gold soldiers mistakenly thought that no one was rushing the goal. Unaware, Zhaorong flashed in and kicked the ball, but unfortunately, the kick was weak.</p>
<p>Then, Jinhai got a wonderful ball from the midfield and dribbled straight in. Although the enemy defense was chasing desperately behind, "Sanlang" stepped on the ball in front of the goal and turned around and put the ball into the net. "Wonderful!" 1-0, Star Island took the lead. The first half ended with this goal deciding the winner.</p>
<p>After a short break, the teams changed sides and continued the battle. The 4/5 Battalion launched a full-scale attack. In less than two minutes, Qixiang was penalized for a foul in the penalty area. Dia took the penalty kick. Although Yaode blocked it, Dia was also alert and rushed forward to add another kick. Yaode could not recover to save it. 1-1, the first tie.</p>
<p>Zhaorong Leads Again with One Kick</p>
<p>The center line was reopened. In the blink of an eye, the three Star Island forwards had already reached the foreign soldiers' goal. Songsheng forced past Dia and shot. Taylor blocked it, but Zhaorong happened to arrive and added another kick. 2-1, taking the lead again.</p>
<p>After that, the two sides engaged in a bitter battle. The foreign soldiers launched a full-scale counterattack. It is estimated that there were also three shots that hit the post. When it came to 42 minutes, seeing that time was running out, the foreign soldiers, in the siege, saw Li G辰 get the ball outside the 25-yard line and make a cold shot. The ball was low and urgent, and Jide could not save it. 2-2, another tie.</p>
<p>The Gloom of Dusk Shakes Hands and Makes Peace</p>
<p>In extra time, both sides did not show any signs of fatigue and continued to attack desperately. Star Island had two shots near the goal that went high. The most dangerous one was in the last second, when Dia's shot hit the post and bounced out. Star Island narrowly escaped defeat.</p>
<p>In the end, neither side achieved anything. In the gloom of dusk, they shook hands and made peace. This means that who gets the final will have to be decided in another battle.</p>
<p>Football Association Advances Replay</p>
<p>[Our Hong Kong Dispatch] Last Saturday - the 22nd, the Special Silver Shield semi-final, Star Island A and B were both forced to draws. The Football Association here held a competition committee meeting the day before - the 23rd. Chairman Huang Jiajun, Li Huitang, Shi Kinna, Luo Zha Shi, Ye Jiugao, etc. were present. It was decided to advance the unfinished games:</p>
<p>Star Island A vs. 4/5 Battalion - Wednesday (26th) at 4:00 PM</p>
<p>Star Island B vs. Navy B - Thursday (27th) at 4:00 PM</p>
<p>This arrangement is entirely for the sake of the 4/5 Battalion, because the 4/5 Battalion is about to return home, so no effort is spared to advance the games.</p>
<p>Currently, the Star Island A and B teams had players injured in the previous week's game. They cannot mix the teams to play. They have sent a letter to the Football Association requesting a postponement.</p>
<p>Also, if they fight 4/5 Battalion on the 26th, and prepare for South China on March 1st - to win the league championship, they will have to cope with three important games in one week, which is really impossible to cope with. Therefore, if the Football Association does not postpone the games, it is impossible to determine how many players can be sent to play at that time. This matter remains to be resolved.</p>

<h3>Spokesperson for the Import Control Committee Talks About the Basis for Quota Allocation - Taking into Account Domestic Production and Foreign Exchange Resources</h3>
<p>[Report] A spokesperson for the Import Control Committee, in response to external criticism of the committee's allocation of quotas for various imported goods, made the following statement yesterday. He said: "The committee's allocation of various quotas is based primarily on the domestic needs. If the imported item is indeed needed, then we will investigate whether there are similar substitutes domestically. If there are, we will make every effort to use domestic substitutes. If not, we will consider allowing imports. Again, we must consider the foreign exchange resources of the country to the extent possible. If it cannot be avoided, then we must also distinguish the urgency of the nature of the goods before approving foreign exchange. The quotas for the 22 types of imported goods announced not long ago for the period from February to April of this year were mostly determined based on the average import value of each item during the three years before the war. The figures come mostly from accurate statistics from the Customs over the years and are by no means fabricated out of thin air. External parties may consider the quotas for certain imported goods to be too generous. For example, for tobacco, it is believed that it can be reduced by half, or that domestic production is sufficient for consumption. It has been found that these 指　lack factual evidence. As for pharmaceuticals, cement, sugar, and automobiles, the import quotas have been temporarily suspended from February to April of this year. This is because the item either has sufficient inventory or has a substitute available. There should be no supply difficulties within three months, so imports are temporarily suspended."</p>
<h3>Fourth Meeting of the Export Promotion Council - Decision to Establish a Bristle Pig Group - Exported Goods from Wuzhou Should Have Remittance Certificates Audited</h3>
<p>[Report] The Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Council held its fourth meeting at the Central Bank at 10:00 AM yesterday. All committee members were present except for Jin Xizhi, who went to Beijing on official business. The meeting was chaired by Bei Zuyi. The important decisions are as follows: (1) To establish a bristle pig group, the list of candidates is as follows: Shen Xirui (convener), Gong Shanbai, Wang Yangxian, Lu Shengtian, Xin Li, Zeng Zehan, An Zijie (also secretary). (2) To determine the remittance export method for goods exported from Wuzhou. This matter has been approved by the Executive Committee and approved by the Executive Yuan. The designated banks managing foreign exchange and the Wuzhou Customs will be notified immediately that all kinds of goods exported through Wuzhou that should be remitted (especially tung oil) will be subject to strict review and must have a certificate of purchase of foreign exchange issued by the designated bank before they can be declared for export.</p>
<h3>Government Agencies Purchasing Foreign Goods - Should Apply for Permits First - No Post-hoc Procedures Allowed</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan has announced and implemented the revised Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade. Subsequently, all government agencies that import materials and equipment from abroad must apply for permits in accordance with the provisions of these measures before ordering. No post-purchase procedures are allowed. The relevant agencies have been ordered to comply. It is reported that the municipal government has received this instruction and has ordered the import and export industry associations to comply.</p>
<h3>Unified Bonds Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>Government bonds were still sluggish yesterday. Unified C opened at 6900 yuan in the morning. Although 550, 544 were accepted, 360, 552 were sold. The price fell from 7000 yuan to 5750 yuan, and finally hovered outside the 6000 yuan mark. As a result, compared with the previous settlement, A, B, and E each fell by 500 yuan, D fell by 300 yuan, and Unified C fell by 700 yuan. The turnover was more than 4 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stocks Rise and Fall</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks were extremely peaceful yesterday, with stocks rising and falling differently. The process was vague. As a result, compared with the previous settlement, Chartered Yarn English United rose slightly. Shipping Wheelock was flat. The rest fell by up to half a percent.</p>
<h3>Foreign Tea Market Stable and Strong</h3>
<p>In the Shanghai Eastern Foreign Market, the most easily sold and stable prices were the Chun Zhen and Zhen Mei teas. The Keemun black tea, which had been stuck for many days, was traded weakly due to a lack of supply and demand. However, it is heard that the British firm Renji Foreign Firm still has 38 boxes of Chen Zhong Keemun from 1934, and is actively negotiating with the cargo owner. The price is also approaching, and there is hope that a transaction will be obtained soon. The jasmine double that is frequently favored by the Suzhou帮 is difficult to see active because the seller's asking price is firm and not loose.</p>
<h3>After Exchange Rate Adjustment - Barter Trade with Japan is Favorable</h3>
<p>[Report] According to sources concerned: the competent authority hopes that the total value of barter trade between China and Japan this year can reach 60 million US dollars. There are nearly 30 kinds of goods that China needs from Japan; Japan hopes that China will supply them with similar things. Compared with Japan's barter trade with other countries, the United States is the highest, followed by the United Kingdom. China ranks after the United Kingdom because it cannot export the food that Japan desires most. After the recent exchange rate adjustment, the barter trade is quite favorable. Regarding the supply of Japanese kiln wood, China hopes to have at least 7-8 million pieces, but Japan only allows the supply of 4 million pieces. It is heard that China has recently made new proposals on this matter. As for Japan's request that China supply soybeans, it is heard that the economic authorities believe that soybeans are an important export commodity in China, just like Japan's cotton textiles. They must be used to exchange for foreign exchange and cannot be included in the scope of barter trade.</p>

<h3>Date Set for Tea Sample Submission and Evaluation</h3>
<p>[Report] The third Tea Evaluation Committee for Export Tea met yesterday and decided on the standard tea samples and the giving points. The committee has now limited tea merchants to submit export tea samples to the Central Bank before next Monday so that they can be collected and scored to determine prices. According to relevant personnel, the evaluation work during the Trust Week is entirely to serve the Central Bank and tea merchants technically. In the past, when tea merchants requested the government to purchase their tea, the Central Bank would lose a lot of money. Now that the exchange rate has been adjusted, there is no need to worry about this. The current world tea market is unfavorable to us. Japanese tea and British tea are competing with us at low prices. Therefore, if the export tea is priced too high, it will put Chinese tea at a disadvantage.</p>
<h3>Large Batch of Flour Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Report] The Greek ship Babakilitis Van Sili Si代理 (音) represented by Jardine Matheson arrived in Shanghai yesterday, carrying more than 7,000 tons of flour, totaling 235,500 bags, which were purchased by the China Trust Bureau代理.

In addition, the ship矮愛別斯, which transported 1,100 bales of cotton from Alexandria, also arrived in Shanghai yesterday and is now docked at the Qichang Warehouse in Pudong for unloading.</p>
<h3>Export Industry Attempts to Reverse the Decline - Decides to Organize a Petitioning Group - and Prepare to Organize an Import Chain Committee</h3>
<p>In order to develop exports and save the crisis, the city's export industry held an important temporary symposium at the Bankers' Association Club at 3:00 PM yesterday. More than 50 representatives from various export industries attended. Ma Zhongda was elected as the temporary chairman. He reported the main points of the meeting, lamented the current difficult situation of the export industry, and pointed out that under the current unstable monetary system, it is not easy to develop export trade by raising foreign exchange. He hoped that colleagues would discuss remedial measures. The following important cases were decided:</p>
<p>Nominate Petition Representatives</p>
<p>(1) In order to explain the actual difficulties of exporting to the authorities and provide opinions on promoting export business in the future, it was decided to organize a petition group. Gu Wensheng, Zhang Yizhi, Qiu Liangrong, Ma Zhongda, Lu Bowei, Wu Li Hou, Qian Peirong, Song Chenglun, Ye Xuxin, Yu Guoyao, Gong Shangu and other eleven people were nominated as petition representatives, and they are prepared to petition the Export Promotion Committee and the Business Bureau of the Central Bank first.</p>
<p>Research Import and Export Chain</p>
<p>(2) In order to study effective ways to develop exports, prepare to organize an Import Chain Research Committee. Qiu Liangrong, Ma Zhongda, Zhang Yizhi, Gu Wensheng, Lu Bowei, Wu Lihou, Qian Peirong, Song Binglun, Ye Xuxin, Yu Guoyao, Gong Shanbai, Zhang Naiqi, He Yehou, and Fang Shengyou were nominated as members.</p>
<p>Please Change the Remittance Deadline</p>
<p>(1) The Central Bank recently stipulated a 90-day deadline for export remittance, which is quite unfavorable to exporters. It was decided to submit a letter to the Supreme Economic Commission and the Export Promotion Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, requesting the Central Bank to consider and change it.</p>
<h3>Fine Cloth Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to the sharp decline in cotton cloth prices over the past few days, and the fact that the Five Blessings fine cloth supplied by the Textile Building Company the day before was 5,000 yuan higher per bolt than the market cloth, people's hearts turned pretty, and there was a sign of absorption in the market. The asking price for 12-pound Longtou fine cloth opened at 130,000 yuan and rose to 142,500 yuan. Five Blessings rose from 137,000 yuan to 140,000 yuan, a rise of 3-5,000 yuan compared to the previous market. The other brands of fine cloth also saw a recovery of 1-2,000 yuan. There was little fluctuation in colored cloth and Shilin cloth yuan bilige, etc.</p>
<h3>Textile Building Supplies at Market Prices - Yarn Prices Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was still hovering in a sluggish state. Customer sales were like a stone sinking into the sea, and there was no movement. The Textile Building Company again had a large batch of private yarn supplied at market prices, making it even more difficult for people's hearts to improve. 20-count yarn fell another 3-50,000, and 42-count fell 100,000 to 150,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that China Textile Building Company sold yarn on behalf of the Textile Control Committee as usual yesterday, selling a total of 463 pieces, including 245 pieces to manufacturers and 218 pieces to yarn numbers. The number of applicants totaled 99, including 59 manufacturers and 40 yarn numbers.</p>
<h3>Salt 引岸 System Abolished</h3>
<p>My international political and business management has always adopted the 引岸 system in the past. The main feature of this system is to make the sales have a certain regional limitation. Within its defined area, a certain sales salt merchant has its own rights and responsibilities to suppress the salt shortage. Going beyond the boundary is private and punished according to苛, and after the number of outbreaks, the salt merchants相逃亡 everywhere, this system was invisibly destroyed by the artillery fire, and the salt administration authorities, when promulgating and implementing the salt monopoly system, also明令explicitly abolished the 引岸system, but the time has been long, been ignored, or played to life for a long time, and the monopoly method has been changed, so recently the Legislative Yuan formally passed it, abolishing the 引岸system, in order to restate the previous order, to promote the development of the free trade system of table salt Yun.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Firm - Miscellaneous Grains Unanimously Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai South Gate and North Gate rice markets received more than 11,700 stones. The South Gate of japonica rice was firm, while the North Gate was less divine. The center was tired. Bai Yuan and Yin Yuan had no access. Indica rice also had few ups and downs. The situation of flour was mediocre, with few changes. Bran sales were sluggish, and績 fell by more than a thousand yuan.</p>
<p>The oil market was tight in the morning and slack in the afternoon, with few honor and dishonor. Soybean cake's actual sales were still light, and it fell frequently, falling another thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous grains unanimously相 　fell, red grain transactions were Qing Yuan懈and continued to fall by a thousand yuan. Corn alcohol moved slightly, and prices were sluggish. Raw peanuts turned sluggish in Nanyang, stopped rising and turned to falling, and returned to a small five to six thousand yuan. Yuan beans were flat, sesame was similar. Soybean outbound sales were not moving, and rumors that the China Trust Bureau would allocate soybeans again made people's hearts weak and soft, and prices fell by two to three thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>Allocation Price for Oil Retail - Still Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>[Report] The Shanghai Edible Oil Allocation Office yesterday allocated 897 dan of edible oil to various edible oil retail stores in the Pudong district. Today, it will allocate to the city center area. The allocation price is 250,000 yuan per dan. As for the retail price at the retail stores, it is still necessary to negotiate with the municipal authorities on whether to exempt business tax before making a decision.</p>
<h3>Casing New Price Announced</h3>
<p>[Report] The opening price of pig intestines is too high. If they are purchased and exported, the price is similar to the overseas market price, so the buying interest is dull and there are no transactions. The new opening price of casings today is 6 million yuan per barrel (1250 pairs), which is also similar to the overseas market price.</p>
<h3>Foreign Prices for Lace and Embroidery Both Fall</h3>
<p>[Report] According to a merchant from a certain Swiss firm in the city, after the foreign exchange rate increased, foreign prices for lace, blankets, embroidery, foreign pillows, buttons, straw hats, etc. have fallen by 20% to 40%. Shanghai market prices have risen sharply and have exceeded the latest foreign market prices, so exports are encountering difficulties.</p>
<h3>Automobile Insurance Premiums to Double Starting Next Month</h3>
<p>The automobile insurance industry in this city, in view of the recent surge in the cost of automobile materials and the increased amount of insurance compensation expenses, convened an extraordinary meeting yesterday to discuss adjusting insurance rates. A resolution was passed by all members to raise the lower limit of insurance coverage from 75,000 yuan to 150,000 yuan starting next month, effectively doubling the insurance rates.</p>
<h3>Iron Prices Plunge by 20%</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The current market price of pig iron is 4.5 million yuan per ton. Due to a significant influx from the mainland, the market is soft and demand is weak, with prices having fallen by 20% from their peak. The prices of wrought iron, sheet iron, and angle iron have also fallen by 10% to 20%.</p>
<h3>Caustic Soda Market Price Drops</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Recently, a large quantity of caustic soda has been shipped from Guangzhou. A portion of it is from orders arriving at the port, with a continuous stream of deliveries that will not cease for some time. Actual sales in the Shanghai market have weakened. Additionally, locally produced liquid caustic soda, which has no difference in usage, is priced 30% lower than solid caustic soda, leading to widespread adoption of the liquid variety. The market price for caustic soda from the inland areas was 4.5 million yuan per barrel yesterday, while American goods were priced at 4.3 million yuan, with few transactions taking place.</p>
<h3>Allocation of Goods Intermittent, Rayon Continues to Soar, Silk Exports Active but Prices Unlikely to Improve</h3>
<p>Rayon prices continued to soar yesterday due to intermittent allocation of goods and strong demand from actual sales customers. For example, No. 120 Kosan Yuko rayon opened at 7.8 million yuan in the morning and immediately saw transactions, later fluctuating upwards to close at 8.1 million yuan. The afternoon was even better, with transactions at 8.3 million yuan, and the final asking price remaining at 8.33 million yuan. No. 75 semi-gloss rayon was bid up to 11.5 million yuan. The scarcity of goods made them valuable, a shocking state of affairs. Yesterday, the factory market remained quiet. Foreign firms with "C" grade had some transactions at 8.15 million yuan, slightly higher than the previous day's asking price. Otherwise, only a few transactions were made by other sellers at prices similar to the previous day. Due to sluggish actual sales, silk fabrics were unable to rise in price. Real silk fabrics were weak, while rayon fabrics, despite the high cost of raw materials, lacked interest and therefore remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Further, in recent days, British and Indian trading firms have shown considerable interest in the raw silk market. However, due to falling raw silk prices in the U.S. market, with grade A priced at $5.50 per pound, asking prices are unlikely to improve. Swedish firm Lianna sold 30 bales of Grade D 20-fen 20-strand raw silk at 7.8 million yuan per bale. Dachang sold 10 bales of Grade C 20-fen 22-strand raw silk at 8 million yuan per bale. Jardine sold 40 bales of Grade D 20-fen 22-strand raw silk at 7.85 million yuan per bale. According to those in the industry, while exports are active, prices are unlikely to improve.</p>
<h3>The Starving World: A Perspective on the International Food Situation</h3>
<p>—Special Translation by the Editorial Department of This Newspaper (Continued)</p>
<p>Although food production in 1946 increased compared to the previous year, global food anxiety has not diminished. Official estimates indicate that for the year from July 1, 1946, to June 30, 1947, total food production increased by 7% compared to the previous year, perhaps reaching the average production level before the war. However, since 1939, the world's population has increased by 7%, meaning that even reaching pre-war production levels is not enough. Calculated by population proportion, the winter food supply in 1946 was approximately 5% less than before the war.</p>
<p>The production of the five grains most needed by famine-stricken countries has not been abundant enough for Europe to end bread rationing. European countries could lift controls on bread consumption if they could import 35 million tons of wheat and other grains. However, based on current supply projections, the likely import volume will not exceed 25 million tons, of which 10 million tons must be supplied by the United States. Given the shortage of railway vehicles and labor strikes in the United States, it seems unlikely that the United States can export the above-mentioned amount.</p>
<p>The supply of fats and oils is far less than the global demand. It is estimated that production is approximately 85% of pre-war levels, but the international trade in fats and oils may not exceed half of pre-war levels. How will countries allocate these significantly reduced fats and oils?</p>
<p>The distribution of these greatly reduced fats and oils will largely depend on the policies adopted by the United States. If the United States lifts import controls, American consumers may find it easier to obtain margarine and soap, but the consumption of some other countries will be 70% less than before 1939, and even fall to one-third in poorer countries.</p>
<p>Although world sugar production has increased by 10%, it still falls short of demand.</p>
<p>Current food consumption in the Americas is 15% higher than before the war, while consumption in vast regions of Asia and Europe is far less than before the war. The difference between the two is like heaven and earth. Severe food shortages are expected in Germany, Austria, Eastern Europe, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>The waves of famine will continue to plague most of the world, and the severity will depend on the United States' policy on export controls.</p>
<p>A comparison of world food production now and in the past is as follows:</p>

<h3>Traces of the Communist Army's Movements in Shandong</h3>
<p>—Jinan, 19th (Airmail Report) Special Correspondent Li Tian from This Newspaper</p>
<p>In total, Shandong has experienced twelve years under the successive rule of "Dog Meat General" Zhang Zongchang and "Clear Skies" Han Fuju. This kind of warlord rule, which disregarded right and wrong, confused black and white, imposed harsh taxes and levies, and treated human life like weeds, objectively paved the way for the Communist Party's intrusion. Subsequently, during the eight years of war against the enemy, Shandong was the first to bear the brunt. By the end of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), the main lines of communication were entirely in the hands of the enemy forces. Under the Communist Party's basic policy of "70% development, 20% coping, and 10% resisting Japan," their strength in Shandong rapidly developed and grew—growing into the second-largest Communist base in the country, second only to Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia and higher than the Northeast.</p>
<h3>Seven Men from Mount Culai, Starting with Six Pens</h3>
<p>As early as during Han Fuju's rule of Shandong, the current chairman of the Communist Party of Shandong Province, Li Yu (from Shanxi), served as the secretary of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party, working undercover in Jinan. In July of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), when the enemy forces captured Dezhou, Han Fuju fled westward, and Li Yu also moved his organization to Changqing. On December 24th of the same year, Jinan fell, and Li Yu moved to Shanyang Village at the foot of Mount Culai in Tai'an County, drafting the Shandong military plan. After the enemy's main forces moved south, they moved to Shanyang Village at the foot of Mount Culai in Tai'an. On the third day of the first month of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), Li Yu and his key figures Lin Hao (from Laiyang), Hong Tao (from Fengren, Jiangxi), Sun Taolin (from Xuzhou), Ma Futang (from Zhucheng), Cheng Zhaoxuan (from Shanyang Village), and Zhu Yugan (from Wangzhuang Village north of Mount Culai), a total of seven people, met in the Great Buddha Hall on the mountain. They formally adopted the Shandong military plan drafted earlier and decided to make full use of civilian firearms, assigning cadres to form six even-numbered detachments in different areas of the province. At that time, the seven of them had six Parker pens and boasted of "starting with seven men and six pens," which is the "Culai Mountain Seven Men Uprising" repeatedly praised by the Communist Party today.</p>
<p>Because Li Yu and others fully grasped and utilized the patriotic sentiments of exiled students from Beiping, Tianjin, and various parts of Shandong, arranging them in the six detachments and making them their most outstanding core cadres, and because of the announcement of cooperation against Japan by both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in the early stage of the war, the former chairman of Shandong Province, Shen Honglie, and his subordinates believed that since the government had announced cooperation, they should treat the Communists with courtesy. Therefore, Shen had appointed several Communist figures as county magistrates. Moreover, most of Shandong Province was occupied at that time, and the judgment of the overall situation was unclear. Even those who had always been dissatisfied with the Communist Party at least adopted a policy of non-offense towards the Communist Party. Coupled with the protection and mutual exploitation of Shi Yousan, commander of the Tenth Army Corps, the Lu Communists expanded from six detachments to nine detachments in the year and a half from the spring of the 27th year to the autumn of the 28th year of the Republic (1938-1939), and the number of people also expanded from seven to more than 30,000.</p>
<p>Xu Xiangqian Changes His Style</p>
<p>Xu Xiangqian, the valiant general of the Eighth Route Army's 115th Division, first entered western Shandong and then moved to southern Shandong in March of the 28th year of the Republic (1939). Before Xu Xiangqian entered Shandong, the Communist army at that time, whether towards the people or the National Army, at least on the surface, still acted according to reasonable and legal guidelines. The relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, to a greater or lesser extent, still maintained peace and cooperation. After Xu Xiangqian entered Shandong and Yan'an ordered him to command the entire Shandong military, he changed his previous style and adopted a policy of terror. As long as it could implement his basic policy of "70% development, 20% coping, and 10% resisting Japan," it was permissible to divide and attack the National Army, to use severe punishments and cruel laws against the people to drive them, and to collude with the enemy as long as their interests did not conflict. As a result, the people were coerced into joining the Communist Party and the Communist army, which increased sharply. Attacks and seizures of equipment from the National Army, especially the local teams and guerrilla detachments under the provincial government, were frequently heard of. At the end of the 28th year of the Republic (1939), Yu Xuezhong was ordered to come to Shandong to establish the Headquarters of the Jiangsu-Shandong War Zone. Due to the discord between Yu and Shen, it objectively created many opportunities for the Communist Party to expand its strength. At that time, the guerrilla teams under Chairman Shen's command were mostly reorganized from civilian armed forces, their strength was weak, and their forces were scattered, making them the most ideal target for the Communist Party to expand its strength. After each ambush on the guerrilla teams Shen could only beg for help from Yu's regular 51st and 57th armies, and Yu's troops had a ‘not my business’ attitude and would not provide appropriate assistance, so from winter of the 28th to the winter of the 30th year of the Republic (1939-1941), the Communist army almost completely wiped out the local troops and the main force of guerrilla teams under the jurisdiction of the Shandong provincial government's administrative offices and county governments by both hard and soft tactics. Subsequently, in the 31st year of the Republic (1942), during the enemy's large-scale mopping-up operation, the Yishui "Encirclement" headquarters base was also forced to abandon. Shen went to the Central Government to report on his work and was transferred to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. The Central Government appointed Mu Zhongheng, commander of the 51st Army under Yu, as chairman of Shandong, uniting military and political power. However, they could not withstand the repeated mopping-up operations by the enemy and puppet forces, the multiple attacks by the Communist army. In addition, in the autumn of the 31st year of the Republic (1942), Wan, brigade commander of Yu's 57th Army, defected to the Eighth Route Army, and in the beginning of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), Wu Huawen, commander of the New Fourth Army, surrendered to the enemy and puppet forces, Shandong's situation became increasingly precarious. Therefore, by the summer of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), the headquarters and the provincial government had to withdraw to Fuyang in northern Anhui. Until June of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), when the former chairman He Siyuan disguised himself and entered Shandong alone, the entire Shandong had been occupied and controlled by the enemy and puppet forces and the Communist army.</p>
<p>A Cancer Grows From This</p>
<p>Before the victory of the War of Resistance, the Communist army first used various methods to occupy 23 county towns including Yishui, Mengyin, and Feixian. After Japan surrendered, the Communist army took advantage of the fact that the National Army's takeover arrangements were not yet finalized. First, they reorganized the original Shandong troops, except for the six divisions of the New Fourth Army (the New Fourth Army had a total of seven divisions, of which the Fifth Division was in northern Jiangsu at that time, and Xu Xiangqian's troops had been transferred to the Northeast). With the nine detachments and the best elements of the militia in each county as the backbone, by the end of January of this year, they had successively expanded into eleven liberation divisions, seven new divisions, seven columns, ten garrison brigades, and four independent regiments, totaling 429,400 people. (Before the victory of the War of Resistance, Xu's troops were transferred elsewhere, and the Shandong military was then commanded by Chen Yi, which will be detailed later.) At the same time, from August 11th of the 34th year of the Republic (1945) to the ceasefire order on January 13th of the 35th year of the Republic (1946), they captured 66 counties and cities including Pingdu, Muping, Yantai, Hecheng, and Haiwei from the National Army, attacked the National Army 2,194 times, killing one division commander, two brigade commanders, four commissioners, seventeen county magistrates, and more than 50,000 officers and soldiers of middle and lower ranks. They also captured six counties, including Laiwu in eastern Shaanxi Province, from the enemy and puppet forces, incorporating more than 5,000 Japanese soldiers and more than 50,000 puppet troops under Zhang Xixian and Han Shuchen. After the announcement of the ceasefire order on January 13th until April 21st, the Communist army again captured the county town of Liuchuan and 19 railway stations including Hongshan, as well as two coal mines. From June 8th to 17th, they launched a major offensive and captured five counties and four towns including Jiaoxian, Dexian, Tai'an, Gaomi, Jimo, Chengyang, Zhoucun, Zhangdian, and Zaozhuang. The ceasefire order became a unilateral obligation of the government. Although the government submitted a memorandum to the Beiping Military Mediation Department on June 19th, the Communist army continued to attack as before. In order to defend itself, the government, around the Double Tenth Festival last year, had the famous anti-Japanese general Wang Yaowu clear the Jiaoji Railway line. From the end of last year to recently, in order to crush its plan to encircle Xuzhou, a major battle was launched in southern Shandong. The Communist army suffered more than one-third casualties. Although its strength has gradually weakened, the deeply rooted momentum it has cultivated in Shandong over the past nine and a half years, which is enough to start a prairie fire, has not diminished in the slightest. Of the 107 counties, three ordinary cities, and one special municipality in Shandong, only 34 counties, one ordinary city (Jinan), and one special municipality (Qingdao) are still in the hands of the National Army. Considering that the Communist army has been continuously reinforced from the Northeast and Hebei-Chahar-Shanxi, it can be seen that it will spare no expense to defend the two-thirds of the counties and cities it occupies in Shandong.</p>
<h3>Will There Be Another Famine This Year?</h3>
<p>—New York, 14th (Airmail Report) By Xiao Fu</p>
<p>Will the world not experience a severe famine this spring and summer like last year? Many countries still do not have enough food, and there will be famines in some places, but they will not be as severe. This year's food production is expected to be more abundant, and the transportation routes damaged during the war can be gradually restored, so there is hope for a better resolution of the food problem.</p>
<p>The production of wheat, sugar, and potatoes will increase in various parts of the world, and the number of fish caught will also be higher. The production of rice and vegetable oil may also increase, but meat, milk, and lard will remain as scarce as this year.</p>
<p>Reports from wheat-producing areas in various continents indicate that this year's harvest is better than any year during the war, with a production equivalent to 5,900,000,000 bushels. This is the reason for optimism among people who eat bread.</p>
<p>People who eat rice—mostly in Asia—can also expect a better harvest, but it will probably be 10% less than before the war. Asia's population is increasing rapidly, and the harvest may not be enough to avoid famine. Last year's harvest was 6,300,000,000 bushels, and this year it is expected to be 6,900,000,000 bushels, but this is still far from the pre-war 7,400,000,000 bushels. The difficult areas are in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>Europe</p>
<p>Europe's staple food is flour, and production will be 1,200,000,000 bushels. Last year's production was 1,030,000,000, and the pre-war average production was 1,620,000,000 bushels. Heavy rains in the United Kingdom and Western Europe and droughts in Eastern Europe have all reduced production. In the United Kingdom, there were continuous cloudy and rainy days during the harvest, and several grains sprouted. This type of grain cannot be used for bread and can only be used as feed for livestock.</p>
<p>Eastern Europe and mainland Russia lacked rain, and the rice and wheat harvests were not good. The production of flour, potatoes, and sugar in Central and Eastern Europe does not even slightly exceed 70% of pre-war levels. This is due to the lack of fertilizers and political instability.</p>
<p>The warm Mediterranean region has the prospect of a bumper harvest. Greece, Italy, Spain, and French North Africa all have better harvests this year than last year. The production of rice, wheat, potatoes, sugar, and oil can reach 85% of the pre-war average.</p>
<p>The harvests in western Germany and Austria are the most hopeless. Due to bad weather, political chaos, and a shortage of labor, this year will be as bleak as last year.</p>
<p>Asia</p>
<p>Although Asia's production is high, the population is increasing too quickly, offsetting each other. India's population has increased by 25 million in the past five years.</p>
<p>Siam, Burma, and Annam used to be rice-producing areas, but current production is below pre-war levels. The Japanese invasion caused considerable damage.</p>
<p>India has several difficult days before the harvest in December. During this stage, food will be imported from foreign countries on the one hand, and the amount of allocation will be reduced on the other hand. India relies on the United States, Brazil, and other countries for assistance. However, foreign assistance is limited, and difficult years cannot be avoided.</p>
<p>The Western Hemisphere has a prosperous harvest.</p>
<p>Canada</p>
<p>Canada is expected to harvest 400 million bushels of flour next year, the highest record since 1942, exceeding the pre-war average by 35%. Some food is being shipped to the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>United States</p>
<p>The United States is expected to harvest 1,160,000,000 bushels of flour, an increase of 37,000,000 bushels over last year. The rice harvest may be the same amount. Last year, the United States shipped part of its grain to Europe and Asia to relieve the famine. This year's export volume is 275 million bushels. Because part of the grain needs to be stored, it is reserved for use in years with poor harvests.</p>
<p>The production of oil this year is not good, and some will need to be imported. The current stock is the smallest in 20 years, and the meat production is also less than last year.</p>
<p>The strike by the longshoremen's union in the United States has prevented grain from being exported, causing panic in many countries in the Far East that are waiting for American grain. In addition to this, the transportation difficulties caused by the war are also a problem.</p>
<p>Argentina</p>
<p>Argentina's exports of rice and wheat are lower than pre-war levels, but meat exports are higher than in 1945. The area of cultivated land increased by 10% last year, and the harvest is expected to increase this year.</p>
<p>This year's world food supply is better than last year, and in addition to harvest factor, there are the following reasons:</p>
<p>The distribution system continues to be implemented in many countries. For example, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom still maintain bread rationing.</p>
<p>Some countries in urgent need of food are provided with assistance. This method will continue, and countries in need of financial assistance will also be subsidized.</p>
<p>Although food production is large, there seem to be problems with ships. Without sufficient ships, grain cannot be exported, which is equal to nothing. Therefore, a large part of the existing ships should be reserved for the transportation of grain.</p>
<p>In short, the world can probably avoid a large-scale famine this year. However, it will take a considerable period of time to restore pre-war daily diets. There will be no signs of abundance before 1948.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Forestry Experiment Institute</h3>
<p>— Taipei, 7th Dispatch (Airmail) - Our Correspondent in Taiwan, Yang Yu</p>
<p>The Portuguese used to call Taiwan "Ilha Formosa" (Beautiful Island). Indeed, Taiwan can be divided into tropical and subtropical zones horizontally. Vertically, it has tropical, temperate, and frigid zones due to varying altitudes. Combined with abundant rainfall and ample sunlight, the forests are suitable for growth, with an especially diverse range of species. Forests, occupying about 70% of the province's total area, nearly 38 million mu, perpetually cover this vast island.</p>
<p>Raising Chickens to Eat Eggs - Consumption Exceeds Production</p>
<p>After the Japanese occupied Taiwan, they highly valued forestry. On one hand, industrial development required timber as raw material, fuel, and data. On the other hand, they protected forests to reduce losses from geological erosion and wind and rain disasters. Therefore, they devoted full effort to management, land reclamation, surveys, research, and experiments, achieving some success. According to past statistics, although Taiwan's annual timber consumption always exceeded production, this was precisely the Japanese approach of raising chickens only to eat the eggs. If we arbitrarily cut down forests without protection and management, eating the chicken along with its skin and meat, I believe that one day Taiwan will only have a few frigid-zone forests remaining on the inaccessible mountaintops.</p>
<p>As early as the 44th year of the Meiji era in Japan (the first year of the Xuantong reign in the Qing Dynasty), a forestry research institution was established under the Colonial Production Bureau in Taiwan. Although its name and system have changed repeatedly, it has consistently conducted highly planned experiments for Taiwan's forestry without any difference in intent. In the 28th year of the Republic, this institution was directly under the Governor-General's Office and was called the "Taiwan Governor-General's Office Forestry Experiment Institute." It was divided into sections such as breeding, management, timber, and forest products. All work related to forest research, experiments, surveys, manufacturing, cultivation, utilization, and everything else was fully included. As a reporter, I am very willing to introduce this large-scale research institution to the country.</p>
<p>A Mound of Debris - Extensive Efforts to Organize</p>
<p>The Forestry Experiment Institute is located in the Taipei Botanical Garden. It originally contained more than 1,200 species of plants, encompassing everything, like a global nursery. However, after the war, due to the construction of air-raid shelters on the grounds, holes were everywhere. Some of the planted trees had their trunks and branches broken by air raids, and some were cut down by locals after the victory. Only roots and stems less than three inches high remained on the ground. Upon takeover, it was just a garden of lush weeds. This loss cannot be compensated for in a short period. After gradual organization, the felled trees were simply left to their fate. The remaining six hundred or so plant species had their rotten and withered branches stripped away, and many labels were added, making it seem somewhat lively.</p>
<p>The damage to the buildings was relatively small. More than 2,500 books were received, as well as more than 26,800 specimens, representing more than 6,000 species. Instruments such as microscopes, slicing machines, and testing machines also numbered in the hundreds. The plywood factory and paper-making factory were quite large in scale. Unfortunately, eight electric motors were stolen during the takeover.</p>
<p>Artificial Ivory - Extracting Sugar from Wood</p>
<p>The institute is currently divided into the departments of Forest Breeding, Forest Biology, Forest Chemistry, Forest Management, Forest Utilization, and Wood Science. The Forest Breeding Department originally planned to investigate the germination, flowering, and fruiting times of useful tree species, study the breeding of useful tree species, with a particular focus on variety improvement, research and observe various meteorological conditions related to forest cultivation, and investigate and analyze the physical and chemical properties of forest soil fertility, such as soil temperature, soil permeability, soil moisture and air content, soil chemical composition, etc. There are nineteen research, investigation, and experiment items for various useful trees. However, according to Director Lin Wei-fang, because the agreed-upon personnel have not yet fully arrived and the requisitioned Japanese personnel have been repatriated, it is necessary to adopt partial experiments. They are currently testing the relationship between seedlings and temperature, moisture, soil, and light intensity. The Biology Department was established not long ago, focusing on the organization of the botanical garden, and also conducting a systematic survey of plant classification, ecology, physiology, and distribution. The Management Department originally planned to study tree shape adjustment for afforestation, experiment with thinning afforestation, and conduct other research, investigation, and experiments related to forest protection. Currently, it is focusing on material organization and plan creation. Much of the practical work is carried out by various branch offices. The Chemistry Department specializes in the research, investigation, experiment, analysis, and identification of the utilization and propagation of forest products. Currently, it has already completed research and experiments on tannin for leather dyeing, plywood glue, and casein (an animal-based adhesive, commonly used in plywood for airplanes). The resin extraction section is also conducting experiments. This year's plan includes manufacturing artificial ivory (made by pressing casein into wood under heat and pressure), bakelite, extracting sugar from wood, and manufacturing artificial wool and artificial leather. Director Lin said that there are very few people in the country who study forestry, and even fewer who study forest chemistry. However, they have now hired Xu Kuang-wu, Lu Zhao-yi, and Wang Xiang-ji, three people with very high status in the domestic forest chemistry field, to lead the work in this department, so future developments are very worthwhile to anticipate.</p>
<p>Manufacturing Plywood - Making Paper from Wood Fiber</p>
<p>The Utilization Department originally planned to have several items for the research, investigation, and experiment of wood and bamboo utilization, the identification of wood and bamboo, and the experiment of physical and mechanical properties, etc. Currently, the wood strength section has added an "Amsler" type 30-ton strength testing machine in the strength testing laboratory and borrowed an "Akashi" type 5-ton strength testing machine from the Third Aircraft Factory to carry out various tests on wood's load-bearing strength, compressive strength, tensile strength, shear strength, cutting strength, and hardness, especially focusing on various tests of materials used for airplanes. The wood anatomy section and the wood craftsmanship processing experiment are also in progress. An important task in the modern application of wood is the artificial drying of wood. This is now being tested. The method of wood preservation is very interesting, using various different chemicals, and pressing them into the wood with varying degrees of intensity using immersion or heating methods, and then placing it in a bacterial culture to observe its corrosion and conduct research and experiments. All the equipment for the plywood factory is well equipped.</p>
<p>Group Illegal Logging - Forests Suffer Devastation</p>
<p>The institute currently has four branch offices, namely the Zhongpu Branch Office in Tainan Jiayi, the Hengchun Branch Office in Kaohsiung, the Lotus Pond Branch Office in Taichung, and the Taimali Branch Office in Taitung, and an experimental site in Baxianshan. Almost one is allocated in each latitude, so the research value is very large. The Japanese indeed spent a lot of effort in managing these places in the past. For example, in the Lotus Pond Branch Office, the experimental sites for Taiwania cryptomerioides, Machilus kusanoi, and Chamaecyparis formosensis have been around for more than 30 years. However, after the victory, the local people collectively logged these excellent experimental forests. The Pingpu Branch Office has planted valuable trees such as teak, silver oak, Indian sandalwood, and iron knife wood. After 40 years of experimentation, the growth is very suitable, and the results are good. Unfortunately, after the victory, the excellent experimental trees were also completely cut down. The Indian rubber trees and mango trees in the Jiayi experimental site of the branch office, which were specially used for collecting rubber, were also stolen. Seventy-three teak trees alone were stolen. The Hengchun Branch Office specializes in introducing famous foreign trees from Southeast Asia. There are more than a dozen species, and they grow very well. They are good species for future promotion. However, they are still openly devastated by the locals. When arguing with them, they roll up their sleeves and say: "The Three Principles of the People stipulate government of the people, by the people, for the people, so these forests are ours, and we can cut them however we want." Director Lin said that this is the most heartbreaking thing he has felt since taking over the Forestry Experiment Institute. However, who would not feel heartbroken to see such a good foundation devastated like this?</p>
<p>Past Achievements - Further Promote and Enhance</p>
<p>According to Director Lin, the Japanese showed some achievements in the Forestry Experiment Institute in the past. In addition to the specimens in the botanical garden and herbarium being commendable, in terms of afforestation experiments, the following major achievements can be listed: such as sowing afforestation experiment, forest tree seed experiment, the relationship between container size and the capacity weight and number of seeds, Acacia confusa seed germination promotion experiment, Roystonea regia and Archontophoenix alexandrae seed germination promotion experiment, Toona sinensis seed germination promotion experiment, Catalpa ovata seed storage experiment, Cinchona seed storage experiment, the relationship between the annual accumulation of mother trees of Cunninghamia konishii and Taiwania cryptomerioides and the shape and germination power of seeds, Cunninghamia lanceolata afforestation and its growth survey in northern Taiwan, Rhus succedanea transplantation experiment in eastern Taiwan, rotting heartwood, Sapium sebiferum transplantation experiment, Diospyros kaki cultivation experiment, Tectona grandis seedling method experiment, Casuarina equisetifolia afforestation experiment, Cocos nucifera cultivation experiment, redwood transplantation experiment, Grewia tiliaefolia cutting afforestation experiment in India, Grevillea robusta and Cassia siamea seedling cultivation experiment, Cinchona cultivation experiment, cocoa tree cultivation experiment, rubber tree cultivation experiment. Regarding useful plant experiments, there are more than 20 kinds of transplantation experiments such as Agave sisalana, Chrysanthemum pacificum, Manila hemp, Miscanthus sinensis var. condensatus and Musa textilis from Red Head Island and Ryukyu, and Panama hat grass. With such a good foundation, we hope to further promote and enhance it.</p>

<h3>Nanchang 10th Dispatch (Airmail) - Rescuing Jiangxi Agriculture and Industry</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Liu Zao</p>
<p>According to Director Cai Meng-jian's report at a work review meeting, the steps for rehabilitation and relief work in Jiangxi are: first, to save lives; second, to solve livelihoods; and third, to solve production. Currently, it has reached the stage of providing relief for livelihoods and production. Following this instruction and four operational principles—1. relief distribution points, 2. relief to individual counties, 3. transportation distribution lines, 4. supervision in divided areas—the main focus of the work is to revive the rural areas of Jiangxi, known as the "Jiangxi Granary," and to increase the production of the abundant but bankrupt areas. Therefore, the rehabilitation work in Jiangxi has now reached the rehabilitation stage.</p>
<p>Reviving the rural areas is the focus of the current stage of Jiangxi's rehabilitation work. In addition to implementing emergency rural relief, such as lending seeds, farm tools, plowing cattle, and repairing farmhouses, to help farmers resume cultivation, the Jiangxi Branch also uses new machinery to promote the reclamation of wasteland, improve production techniques, and increase food production in order to achieve rural revival.</p>
<p>The prevalence of cattle plague is a fatal wound in Jiangxi's rural areas. Each year, approximately 25,000 plowing cattle die from the epidemic in the affected areas. In today's rural areas, where plowing cattle are scarce, how can the dead cattle be replaced? The Jiangxi Branch and the Jiangxi Provincial Agricultural Institute jointly established a cattle plague prevention team. Since late August of last year, they have been gradually implementing free injections in the areas with the most severe cattle plague epidemics in the province, such as Ji'an, Jishui, Taihe, and Yongxin counties. As of the end of November last year, a total of 27,890 plowing cattle in 83 townships had been injected, benefiting 26,459 farming households.</p>
<p>In order to resettle disaster-stricken farmers, promote the reclamation of cultivated wasteland, experiment with mechanized collective agricultural production, improve production techniques, and revive rural areas, the Jiangxi Branch has selected rural areas that have suffered severe disasters to start establishing large-scale cooperative farms. The Zhanggongdu Cooperative Farm in Yongxiu County has completed preliminary preparation work, planning to reclaim 5,000 to 10,000 mu of cultivated land and recruit 100 to 200垦民. It is expected that after the initial construction phase is completed this year, it will be able to achieve self-sufficiency and self-reliance. The Xiangfuguan Cooperative Farm in Gao'an County is also being planned. It plans to reclaim 2,000 mu of cultivated wasteland in succession and recruit 40 to 50垦民. In addition, the Self-cultivating Farmer Demonstration Zone, sponsored by the Commissioner's Office of the Third Administrative Region of Jiangxi, has also received a subsidy of 10 million yuan and 1,000 bags of flour from the Jiangxi Branch to recruit墾民 and engage in reclamation.</p>
<p>Repairing farmland water conservancy is an urgent task in the post-disaster rural areas. Because the river dikes and embankments in various places were either in disrepair for many years or were dug up and destroyed by enemy troops, Mr. Zhang Guoji undertook the reorganization of farmland water conservancy projects during his tenure. With an expenditure of 100 million yuan, he cooperated with the Yongli Bureau to repair the embankments and culverts in Nanchang, Xinjian, and Yongxiu counties, completing 63 breaches, 189 dangerous sections, and 100 culverts, benefiting a total of 765,520 mu of farmland. In May, the Jiangxi Branch cooperated with the Jiangxi District of the Yangtze River Yongli Committee's dike blocking and embankment restoration project to repair the dikes and embankments along the rivers and lakes in the province. The initial phase of the project has already been implemented in the suburbs of Nanchang City and in Nanchang, Xinjian, Jinxian, Hukou, Pengze, Yongxiu, Qingjiang, Fengcheng, Xingan, Linchuan, Yujiang, Jiujiang, Ruichang, Wannian and other counties, repairing 237 embankments, benefiting 3,459,620 mu of farmland. Director Cai Meng-jian once accompanied Duncan, a representative of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), to inspect the work site and believed that this type of work was truly beneficial to the rural areas and should be strengthened. Therefore, he further used the existing relief supplies to organize a second phase, while also taking into account drought prevention projects.</p>
<p>The Longxi Gate in Jingjiang and the Jiurui Embankment in Ruichang, Jiujiang, are several major farmland water conservancy projects that the department has recently organized. After completion, the benefited farmland will often be over 140 mu.</p>
<p>It is estimated that there are 500,000 mu of farmland in Jiangxi that were abandoned during the war and have not been reclaimed. In order to utilize the farmers' winter leisure time to reclaim wasteland and increase production, the Jiangxi Branch cooperated with the Jiangxi Provincial Land Reclamation Office to launch a comprehensive winter reclamation and village restoration movement in a competitive manner, with the goal of reclaiming 400,000 mu of wasteland.</p>
<p>The winter reclamation and village restoration movement is scheduled to be completed before the end of March this year. The total amount of subsidy and relief funds is 200 million yuan, and 20,000 bags of flour and 20,000 pieces of agricultural tools are allocated for awards. The first phase of funds and materials has been distributed to various counties and is now being actively promoted.</p>
<p>The losses suffered by Jiangxi's industry during the war were extremely severe. In terms of construction, the estimated loss of houses in the province is more than 50%, the damage to roads reaches 90%, the tonnage of surviving waterways is less than one-eighth of the pre-war level, and railway vehicles have been completely relocated, with only the roadbed remaining. As for the original public and private mines, numbering more than 250, the number that can barely maintain production today is less than one-fifth of the total number during the war. Therefore, the disasters suffered by various industries in the province, both directly and indirectly, are very deep.</p>
<p>Over the past year, assisting in the repair of public buildings has been an important task of the Jiangxi Branch in the industrial relief sector. A total of 58 health institutions have been allocated for repair. Secondly, in order to assist in the restoration of transportation, in addition to allocating 3,000 bags of flour to subsidize the earthwork project of the Nanxun Road, another 3,000 bags were allocated to subsidize the Wuwan Highway project. In addition, highways such as Taihe, Ganxian, Wan'an, and Pingxiang, the Zhanggongdu Bridge wedge on the Nanxun Highway, and the Taiping Bridge in Nancheng have all been allocated funds by the department for repairs, and are currently under construction. The Zhongxiao Bridge in Ganxian and the Longkai Iron Bridge in Jiujiang are also applying for funds and planning to repair them.</p>
<p>Developing industrial and mining enterprises is an effective measure to support small-scale handicrafts. Jiangxi has organized loans for the paper industry, brick and tile industry, etc., and has also applied for industrial and mining equipment for various mines in an attempt to restore the inherent industrial and mining enterprises. However, among the relief materials distributed to Jiangxi by UNRRA, very few industrial equipment has been transported. Currently, only one set of power generation equipment each has been approved for distribution to the Nanchang Water and Electricity Plant and the Bole and Pingxiang mines. As for rural industry, due to the wide scope and limited manpower and financial resources, it can only start from developing special product industries. It has already planned to establish three demonstration factories for porcelain, hemp, and papermaking, and two brick and tile cement factories.</p>
<p>The biggest difficulty in Jiangxi's current industrial relief work is that the Executive Yuan stopped the original special construction funds from August of last year, so the construction project was unfortunately announced to be suspended. Schools and rural farmhouses in various places that have been damaged and urgently need subsidies for repairs are looking forward to receiving relief. However, the relief and rehabilitation office that is responsible for this work is also "unable to help." Now they can only do their best to focus on repairing water conservancy projects, assisting in the restoration of transportation, and developing special product industries, and pay attention to using the work-relief method to conform to the principle of "incorporating rehabilitation into relief."</p>
<p>The reconstruction of the province's industrial and mining enterprises is dependent on the arrival of industrial and mining equipment from the Executive Yuan. This is an urgent call in industrial restoration.</p>

<h3>A Chronological Biography of Ye Xia'an</h3>
<p>— Lu Danlin</p>
<p>Over the past ten years or so, I have read several satisfying chronological biographies of modern figures. One is the "Biography of Mr. Zhang Jianzhi of Nantong" and the other is the "Chronological Biography of Mr. Liang Yansun of Sanshui." These two biographies provide detailed descriptions of China's politics, culture, and economy in the past 80 years and can be used as a concrete and micro-level reference for China's modern history.</p>
<p>However, these two chronological biographies were compiled by later generations after Zhang and Liang passed away. Recently, I read "A Chronological Biography of Mr. Ye Xia'an," which has further deepened our understanding. Because Zhang's period of political activity was very short, and Liang's official positions were limited to the north, while Ye's, in addition to the north, served as the Minister of Finance of the Great Protectorate during the Southern Protectorate Movement, the Minister of Railways of the National Government in the 20th year of the Republic, and even during the Anti-Japanese War, he served as a director of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund. Up to now, although he has not actually participated in political work, he is actually still planning and guiding cultural and economic construction undertakings and has taken part of the responsibility. Therefore, we read the chronological biographies of Zhang, Liang, and Ye in sequence, which is no less than an abridged version of China's modern history. Moreover, there are countless precious historical materials in it, which cannot be found even in modern history books.</p>
<p>Ye is known as one of the two great generals of the transportation industry, the other being Long Jianzhang. Ye's alias is Yu Hu, so people call him Hu. When we talk about the senior figures in today's transportation industry, everyone unanimously recommends Mr. Ye Xia'an (Gongchuo), which is a fact that no one in China's construction industry can deny. From the 66 years of historical events in his chronological biography, we not only know people by discussing the world, but we can also know the world by knowing people. In the chronological biography, Ye's political career began at the age of 26, when he entered the General Affairs Section of the Archives Department of the Postal Department as a clerk. Before long, he was appointed as a chief drafter, which is equivalent to a section member who drafts documents. However, from chief drafter, he was promoted rapidly and served as the Minister of Communications three times, and as the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Railways once each. He oversaw the national postal, telecommunications, aviation, and road administrations for decades and was indeed an outstanding construction leader. From his chronological biography, we can understand the evolution of China's transportation, politics, economy, and culture over the past few decades, which can be used for historical research and reference for research and tourism administration. And the changes he experienced are all closely related to his lifelong career.</p>
<p>When Ye was eighteen years old, he took the children's examination, and the examiner Zhang Baixi was extremely impressed by his railway poem and admitted him to the prefectural school as the top student. Ye's appreciation by Zhang began from then on, and his later achievements were mostly closely related to the railway, which can also be considered a coincidence.</p>
<p>Ye was unusually intelligent in his early years. At the age of twelve, he met Wang Degeng, and Wang used his name to form a couplet. Ye responded with "Gongshuzi," and Wang was surprised and praised him upon hearing it. And his "Ode to the Silkworm" written at the age of fifteen can summarize his life. The poems are like this: "Clothing covers the world, who can recognize its kindness! Once the work is done, the cast-off skin remains. Working to forget one's life, laboring in the hope of little success. Although bound by one's own threads, it is not a pitiable worm!" Words are the voice of the heart, which shows his ambition. The promotion of civil servants has a certain procedure. The promotion and transfer of officials in the former Qing Dynasty was even more difficult. However, he entered the Ministry of Posts and Communications to work in November at the age of 26. In March of the following year, the Ministry established a Railway Coordination Office to oversee the affairs of loaning money to various roads. He also served in the office, and in June, he filled the position of road administration assistant drafter. In July, he was nominated as a probationary secretary, and in August, he was appointed as a small seventh-rank official in the capital. In September, he served as the acting secretary and filled the position of section chief of the Secretariat's Confidential Section. In October, he filled the position of section chief of the official section of the Road Administration Department, and in November, he filled the position of the general section member of the Railway Administration. It was equivalent to the coordinator at that time. In April at the age of 28, he filled the position of road administration secretary, and in May, he was promoted to the road administration assistant secretary. In September, he was promoted beyond the normal promotion to the road administration director and also transferred to the secretariat as a judge. We can only see from this short period of more than a year, the rapid promotion, that without extraordinary talent, there would be no such promotion. This proves that he has special skills. Therefore, he was able to lay the foundation for China's transportation industry for decades, and his students and former subordinates are all over the country.</p>
<p>Hu Hanmin was Ye's childhood (seven years old) classmate. In the twelfth year of the Republic, after reading Ye's "On Using Transportation to Save the Country," he wrote a letter saying, "After reading your book, I am deeply impressed by its thoroughness and insight. However, I have not seen this book in Shanghai, and the public's discussion of transportation is not fair. It seems that the propaganda campaign is too late, so that those who are complacent have taken the lead in public opinion. Repeated slander will destroy gold. Isn't it a regrettable thing!..." Hu and Ye knew each other for decades and still had such words. Those who do not understand the content of the transportation industry naturally do not understand it even more, and they are even more estranged from those who were in charge of transportation at that time.</p>
<p>Ye certainly had great achievements in the transportation industry, but he also had detailed descriptions of China's political reforms over the past few decades, such as the abdication of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, the Hepu Peace Conference, the suppression of the Restoration, participation in the Protectorate Movement, the change of banner in the three northeastern provinces, as well as the cultural movement, national diplomacy, the organization of national heritage, the compilation and printing of series of books, the promotion of art, and the preservation of monuments in his chronological biography. It not only commends his conduct, but in fact, it is enough to be our guide. We should not forget this point when reading the chronological biography.</p>
<p>This chronological biography, more than 380 pages, was printed and published by the Xia'an Draft Chronological Biography Compilation and Printing Committee in October of last year as a commemoration of Ye's 66th birthday. Because it is not for sale, in addition to his relatives, friends, students, and former subordinates who funded the book for preservation, it may be a bit difficult for outsiders who want to read and cherish it. It is said that only 2,000 copies were printed in the first and second printings.</p>
<h3>On Cultivation</h3>
<p>— Tradition First</p>
<p>By Zhu Guangqian, Published by Zhong Zhou Society</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu can be said to be a mentor to Chinese youth. His "Twelve Letters to Youth" has been one of the most popular books among middle school students for many years. "On Beauty" is also a good book. However, I like his "Literary Psychology" the most. His writing is not deliberately crafted like that of so-called literary figures, but reading his books naturally cultivates a sense of beauty in people. In the past decade or so, Mr. Zhu's thinking and scholarship have progressed. Although the language of his Literary Psychology is beautiful, the conceptual framework is not yet rigorous enough. Last month, I read two articles by him on aesthetics in the Ta Kung Pao newspaper, and I personally felt that his theory was much more rigorous, although the expression in his writing seemed a bit too plain.</p>
<p>I had heard long ago that Mr. Zhu had a book on self-cultivation, but I couldn't find it. Recently, I happened to buy it at a bookstall in Nanjing. Although I still enjoy reading his books as before, I feel that it is not as good as I had hoped. Mr. Zhu said, "Some of the things I said in my debut work were quite naive for a young person. When I wrote them, I was inevitably driven by momentary passion and lacked discretion. Looking back now, I feel quite ashamed. Now that I have eaten ten more years of meals, read a few more books, encountered more human affairs, and spent more time thinking and experiencing, I feel that although the old words do not need to be repeated, the loopholes must be filled." However, I feel that in the process of Mr. Zhu patching the loopholes, the passionate naivete that he felt "ashamed" of has also disappeared. I think this is a pity. Although we are against preachy lectures, we would still like to see people having passionate and spirited conversations with us. We regret that Mr. Zhu lacks this youthful vigor.</p>
<p>This book is a collection of many short essays. It begins with some heartfelt words, saying, "The current students are all walking a common and dim path, which does nothing to advance culture or improve society." He also said, "Education does not seem to have a good influence on people's quality. This generation of people treads the same path as the previous generation with their eyes open, and the next generation of people still treads the same path as this generation with their eyes open. This cycle continues endlessly, and the retribution is the same. 'When will the long night end?'" Therefore, he wants young people to understand their era, to understand the current position of the nation, to understand the individual's relationship to the nation, and to make themselves a powerful part of society. He then discusses aspiration, the psychological pathologies of youth, how to interact with others, compassion, shame, learning, reading, as well as friendship, sex and love, leisure, and physical education.</p>
<p>Although these are his successively published thoughts, there is a consistent central idea. He himself said, "In general, I like calmness, composure, stability, and fortitude. I use a detached spirit to do worldly work, and I respect ideals and will, but I do not belittle emotions and imagination... I believe in the accumulation of over four thousand years. I am not borrowing from the creators of ideologies." What I like about these articles is that the topics they discuss are the crystallization of the author's decades of experience. There is no affected moaning or empty talk. For example, he wants young people to (1) have the courage to take responsibility for themselves; (2) know how to be pragmatic, accept the current situation and seek solutions; (3) understand that their own mental illnesses must be cured by their own efforts. Although these have a slight preachy tone, I am pleased that the content is based on experience and the analysis has a scientific basis. Moreover, he proposed a positive way to fundamentally transform young people, which is to implement a new type of education. He advocates that the focus of education should shift from attending classes and reading books to learning how to be a person. He said, "Many complex courses must be cut away with decisive measures. Students should spend at least half of their time living in genuine groups and engaging in national activities." He even has a practical education reform plan, which is truly different from the lofty ideals discussed by those high-minded educators.</p>
<p>However, what we want to criticize is that these articles are not as detailed as his previous ones, and the thinking is based more on experience and less on analytical work. This is enough to reflect the anxiety of wartime life, which has affected the work of scholars. He said, "These articles were written late at night while listening to my wife and daughters snoring... Although I was quite diligent, the writing is inevitably a bit slack and perfunctory." However, this frank and sincere attitude is still lovely.</p>
<p>I remember that Feng Youlan's books and theories are always "for the sake of achieving peace for our country and enabling our hundreds of millions of people to live and work in peace," while Mr. Zhu said, "Many authors currently writing books claim to want to contribute to the great cause of nation-building, wielding a pen and starting a new school of thought. I do not have this kind of learning, nor do I have this kind of ambition or delusion. I know that this booklet is like a floating cloud, appearing for a moment and then disappearing. But I hope that during this time it can present a brilliant light and shadow through the crystal-clear heart-cloud of the reader, just as a floating cloud does through the clear water of a pool. If the spirit does not perish, then this influence, however subtle, can spread infinitely." We feel that this brilliant light and shadow is more impactful on young people than those great works that "establish the heart for the world, establish life for the people, continue the lost learning for the past sages, and open up peace for all generations."</p>
<h3>Introducing Two Pamphlets</h3>
<p>— Xin Jun</p>
<p>"Our Motherland" Series, New China Publishing House</p>
<p>Recently, I read the three published books in the "Our Motherland" series and feel that they are must-read books for young people because they point out the current situation of China in various aspects for young people, enabling them to gain a clear understanding and strengthen their love for the country. Its writing is simple and popular, making it very suitable for the general public of young people.</p>
<p>Now, I would like to introduce two of the best books and solemnly recommend them to you young people.</p>
<h3>"What is the National Assembly?"</h3>
<p>— By Peng Hesheng</p>
<p>First edition, December 1946</p>
<p>The name "National Assembly" is familiar to every young person, but young people may not all understand the meaning, organization, and powers of the National Assembly. This book clearly explains the parts that young people are not very familiar with.</p>
<p>First, it explains what the National Assembly is, stating that the National Assembly is an institution that exercises civil rights and guarantees that "the sovereignty of the Republic of China belongs to all citizens." The author clearly explains the relative terms of direct democracy and indirect democracy. The book also gives examples of Sun Yat-sen's teachings on the National Assembly.</p>
<p>Second, it describes the powers of the National Assembly: It explains the powers of the National Assembly in three aspects: formulating the constitution, exercising central ruling power, and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, discussing the advantages and disadvantages in a very accurate way.</p>
<p>Third, on the aspect of the National Assembly and the Parliament, it explains the difference between the National Assembly and the Parliament, the advantages of the cabinet system, and the "tangible" National Assembly, in a concise and clear manner.</p>
<p>Fourth, it talks about the organizational law of the National Assembly and the election of representatives. The author points out the advantages and disadvantages of the organizational law and the electoral law in a very truthful manner.</p>
<p>Finally, the book looks forward to the future of the National Assembly and democratic politics. The author gives a prospective explanation of the National Assembly and the future of Chinese democratic politics, standing on his objective political perspective.</p>
<p>Chinese democratic politics must be implemented, and it is necessary to understand the National Assembly. So, to understand the National Assembly, young people should read this book.</p>
<h3>"The Motherland in the Last Century"</h3>
<p>— By Huang Yaomian</p>
<p>First edition, January 1947</p>
<p>The past century of China has always been a history of the people's struggle against slavery. This small book clearly and accurately explains the various events that have occurred in China in the last century. The content is also explained in five points:</p>
<p>First, from the Opium War to the Eight-Nation Alliance; we know that the Opium War was the first to break through the political and economic walls of China, enabling international capitalism to plunder and exploit. This book first points out the Opium War and the Anglo-French Allied War, which led China to embark on the path of semi-colonialism. After that, the author briefly describes the Taiping Rebellion and the Nian Rebellion, the two anti-Qing autocratic movements. The author clearly tells the young people about these.</p>
<p>The loss of border territories and vassal states after the Opium War, the fact that imperialists intensified their plunder, the author also describes in the same way. The Sino-Japanese War rapidly lowered China's status. At that time, China still maintained an independent appearance on the surface, but in reality, it had been divided by the powers. This section of facts is also told to us in this book.</p>
<p>The details of the Hundred Days' Reform, the Boxer Rebellion, and the Eight-Nation Alliance War are written clearly in this book, which does not take up much space.</p>
<p>Second, the causes, process, and lessons of the failure of the Xinhai Revolution. This book describes the establishment of the Tongmenghui, the success and failure of the Xinhai Revolution, the North-South negotiation with Yuan Shikai, and the Second Revolution caused by Yuan Shikai's dream. The author also explained it appropriately.</p>
<p>Third, it points out World War I and China, as well as the Twenty-One Demands between China and Japan, Yuan Shikai's attempt to become emperor, and the revolt of the military governors. These historical facts related to World War I and China can all be seen.</p>
<p>Fourth, the May Fourth Movement and the revolutionary climax of 1926, the author points out the causes and process of the May Fourth Movement and the formation of the revolutionary climax of 1926.</p>
<p>Finally, it talks about the September 18th Incident and the Anti-Japanese War. Every young person may still remember this part of the facts. The book further strengthens our understanding.</p>
<p>This book clearly tells young people about the basic knowledge of Chinese history in the last century. All young people should read it.</p>
<h3>"The Razor's Edge"</h3>
<p>— Li Dongfang</p>
<p>The Razors Edge by Somerset Maugham</p>
<p>This book was first published in February 1944, and it has been almost three years now, so it cannot be considered a new book. However, it is still very popular. In addition to the fact that this bookstore has published 15 editions and that bookstore has published 5 editions, the popular version of the pocket bookstore has been printed several times. Hollywood made it into a movie last winter, spending millions of dollars. This film, starring Tyrone Power as the lead and Gene Tierney as the female lead, caused a sensation in the United States. Talking about "The Razor's Edge" is very fashionable in the social circles of the upper and middle classes.</p>
<p>Why is it so successful? Because it best suits American tastes? Not only that. Americans today are already able to appreciate things that do not only suit their tastes. I think this is progress for Americans. This book tempts Americans to use their brains to think about life's problems, and Americans feel that it is very interesting. This is the reason for the book's huge success.</p>
<p>The author is British and has lived in the United States for a long time and is very familiar with American society. Few Americans can match his writing. (At most eight or nine people). He is famous throughout the world for "Of Human Bondage," and has also written a book about China, China Screen, which is not very flattering to the Chinese habit of using people as animals (such as pulling carts and boats, etc.).</p>
<p>The words "The Razor's Edge" come from the Indian classic, Ratha Upanishad, which says, "Salvation is like climbing over a razor's edge." And this book is the story of a young man who hopes to be saved and to save others.</p>
<p>This young man was an air force pilot in World War I. During the battle, he saw his best friend shot down and killed while trying to save him, and he was deeply moved. He also saw dead bodies piled up like salted fish on the battlefield, but just a few days before, they were still full of life. He had gone through the matter of life and death, but he could not understand it. But he wanted to understand very much and looked down on everything else.</p>
<p>He returned to his hometown of Chicago. His fiancée was waiting for him, and his mother-in-law was planning his future. The best way out seemed to be to join the stock exchange and become a broker's partner. He could get rich quickly and have a high social status! In this way, he could get married, have children, and educate them. He only felt bored.</p>
<p>His fiancée hoped that he would start working immediately, and then get married after he got a job. He said, "I want to study 'learning' first." What kind of "learning" does he want to study? He did not go to school to get a degree, but hid in public libraries or nightclubs, reading random books. He read randomly without a plan, and no one knew when he would get it. The stock exchange? He had no interest. "Why persuade people to buy stocks and be fooled?" Moreover, he had seen people die, seen people live, made friends with heroes, and seen heroes turn to dust, so going back to sell stocks and count money was too boring.</p>
<p>His fiancée was very cute, he knew that, and he had never loved another woman. But he was not as anxious as she was. He asked her for a year's leave, and then he would come back and get married. This young man then wandered around the mountains and rivers, traveling to famous cities.</p>
<p>He did not even give her a real address, but asked a travel agency to forward letters. In short, he spent much of his time in Paris.</p>
<p>A year later, his fiancée and her mother came to Paris with the purpose of finding the young man and taking him back to get married. He was very happy and had sweet talk with his fiancée, but marriage required him to work: selling stocks. He begged to let him study further, and then wait until he fully understood life. His fiancée was not happy.</p>
<p>His fiancée angrily returned the ring and went back to Chicago to marry a small boss on the stock exchange. One year, two years, three years went by. Life was very happy, with food and clothing, and she had two lovely daughters.</p>
<p>He did not mind, but went to experience the taste of life in addition to reading. He went to a coal mine to work as a miner, and then went to a farm in Germany to work as a "long-term worker." He traveled to many places, pursued the truth, visited famous teachers, and finally achieved his goal in India. He became a disciple of an old master and gained many subtle insights. The old master ordered him to go down the mountain and experience the secular world again.</p>
<p>A long time later, he met his fiancée again in Paris. The world had changed quickly. Prosperity turned into depression. A certain storm wiped out the property of his fiancée's husband's family. Her husband also suffered from an incurable disease that caused frequent headaches. Her whole family moved to a small city to live. His fiancée cooked and washed clothes, and her husband did low-level manual labor, earning very little. Her uncle was still doing well in Paris and wrote to her, asking her to take her husband to Paris for treatment.</p>
<p>The young man was already middle-aged. His name was Larry. Larry still did not associate with the woman's uncle, and he got along well with the author (Maugham), but Maugham did not know much about his whereabouts. It just so happened that after the woman's family moved to Paris, Maugham met Larry on the street and took Larry to the uncle's house to see the woman and her husband and children.</p>
<p>Everyone had unspeakable emotions when they met. However, Larry was not very sad. He cured the bankrupt husband's headache, using hypnosis he learned in India. Everyone went to a low-class cafe, where they met a pitiful old friend who was working as a prostitute. Larry decided to save her, get her out of her misery, help her quit drinking, and was preparing to marry her. However, the woman actually sabotaged it, tempting her to relapse into alcohol abuse, making her ashamed and leaving.</p>
<p>In Marseille, this prostitute got along well with a sailor. As a result, she was killed by the sailor with a razor blade and thrown into the sea. The police found Larry and Maugham's names among her belongings, and asked them to take care of the funeral. This poor woman could not pass the "razor's edge."</p>
<p>Larry never saw the woman again. He only wanted to buy a streetcar and become a driver after returning to the United States. This job had a good income, was very free, and allowed him to meet many people.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that "The Razor's Edge" is perfect in technique. Its advantage lies in making people think deeply. The woman is not a bad person, but a very reasonable ordinary person. She loves Larry. Of course, Larry is not a heartless bad person either. He has unspeakable difficulties. It is also difficult to determine whether he has really pursued the truth, and it is not necessary to determine it. Truth is not easy to pursue, and it is always worthy of our sympathy if one is willing to pursue it. That prostitute is really too pitiful.</p>
<p>Everyone admires the energy of the Americans. But they are not like our Chinese nation, which is old and sad, and they do not know very well the impermanence of human life. They can get many benefits if they are willing to spend a little precious time to think about it by reading this book. (We Chinese and Indians think about it too much.)</p>
<h3>Arts and Literature Scene</h3>
<p>— Bo Lin</p>
<p>Recently, two French cultural figures came to Shanghai: one is Cartier, the editor-in-chief of Le Matin, and the other is the female novelist Roube-Jansky. The former is traveling around the world and passing through China; the latter likes China very much and plans to stay in various Chinese cities for a longer period of time in order to get to know China.</p>
<p>Pierre Bonnard, the greatest French painter of modern times, recently died of pneumonia in Cannes. People in the art world expressed their condolences. Bonnard was an authority in the modern French art world, and his achievements are a milestone in the history of French painting. His death is a great loss to the French cultural world.</p>
<p>Recently, the French community in this city organized a drama club and prepared to stage a play. They are now actively rehearsing, and the performance is expected to be held around Easter.</p>
<p>French films are also appearing in this city: French newsreels were screened at the French Association on Huanlong Road at 6 pm on the 23rd of this month. The latest French film will be screened at the French Association at 6 pm on March 2, and may be commercially screened in cinemas in this city in the future.</p>
<p>The French Association recently held a cultural lecture on the topic of "French Literature and Today's France." The content gave a detailed description of the three major schools of French literature: existentialism, communism, and Christianism. There was a detailed introduction to the publications during the French occupation period, such as the famous "Midnight Series," and newly published magazines and books, newly famous writers, and the situation in various literary departments such as novels, essays, poems, and dramas. It is said that there will be similar lectures in the future.</p>
<p>The authoritative French film magazine "Screen" recently published a long article introducing Chinese films, giving a detailed and accurate report on the history of Chinese films and the struggle of Chinese films during the Anti-Japanese War. The evaluation of Chinese films is very high, and it concludes by saying that it hopes to see peaceful productions soon.</p>

<h3>The Difficulty of Socializing</h3>
<p>— Qi Lou</p>
<p>Several years ago, I read something like "The Road to Success." The most touching sentence for me was that young people must develop outwards and not be afraid of socializing if they want to succeed. The first step was to advise people to take the initiative and say hello to people they know. I felt that as long as you were willing to do it, even a fool could do it, so I started to implement it.</p>
<p>At a lively banquet, I met a small businessman I had seen more than three times. I felt that I had to put my determination into practice. I walked over, my face was facing him, and my eyes looked at his eyes pleadingly. His eyes were looking at the top of me; I walked over again, his eyes were looking at our right side; I took another step forward, and his eyes were looking at our left side; I was almost touching him, and he suddenly lowered his eyes and looked at the ground. In short, he saw everything, but he didn't see me.</p>
<p>But I was determined, and I called out to him in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen!"</p>
<p>He raised his head, staring at me as if he were looking at a white wall. At that moment, I almost lost confidence and thought I had recognized the wrong person, if it hadn't been for the posture he used to lift his glasses, which reminded me of the impression he gave when he first received me in the manager's office.</p>
<p>"I am Zhang Qilou..." I mustered up my courage again.</p>
<p>"Oh?" His eyes widened even more, and then he said in an unusually polite manner, with an attitude of a wise man valuing the talents under him, "I'm sorry, it seems that we haven't met before. I'm afraid you've recognized the wrong person."</p>
<p>"I... I have visited you before."</p>
<p>"Oh, is that so? I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I still have to say a word to Old Zhou," he rushed past me and started talking to a small banker. From then on, I dared not look at him again.</p>
<p>From then on, I knew how difficult "socializing" was, especially when you met a myopic and forgetful noble.</p>
<h3>Small Incident</h3>
<p>— Ji Shui</p>
<p>The Hangzhou-Shanghai train, which was supposed to depart at 6:10 in the morning, was already packed when I arrived at 4:00. Fortunately, I didn't have much luggage, so I squeezed into a third-class car that was about the same age as me.</p>
<p>Finally, I occupied a relatively spacious foothold. I held on to the back of someone's seat with one hand, and stood in the "at ease" position, preparing to stand for a long time. There were no electric lights in the car, only a faint cold light from the platform. I leisurely looked at the companions in the carriage with the mood of "observing all things": some were dozing off, some were chatting, some were cursing, and some were saying nice things, while the car door was still squeezing and creaking, and people were coming up one after another. Suddenly, the woman holding the child next to me and a man sitting down started arguing. The woman said, "Because I'm holding a child, I can't stand for a long time. I just want a little space from you. You just have to squeeze a little bit. What does it matter?" The man said, "I came at two o'clock and only got this seat. If I give it to you, wouldn't my three or four hours of 'early' be for you to 'get up' with? I didn't receive your money, did I? Besides, since you know you want to sit, why didn't you come earlier?" Then another standing man said, "Why are you so rude? The woman who is holding the child is not sitting, but you, a young and strong man, are sitting. Are you at ease? You don't understand the rules at all." Suddenly another man shouted loudly, "This is his priority. What does it have to do with you? In this world, where are the rules being talked about? Where are the rules being talked about?" Finally, half a seat was squeezed out for the woman holding the child, and the storm subsided immediately. I looked at each of them with amazement and admiration. I didn't expect to encounter the long-extinct "justice" and the virtue of daring to speak out today.</p>
<p>It wasn't until the train entered Linping Station, and everyone put down the glass windows to buy spiced bean curd and tea eggs from the vendors, that I realized that they were a couple and the two were fellow villagers. So, I was at a loss again.</p>
<h3>I Don't Want to Be Insulted - A Female Employee's View on Female "Vases"</h3>
<p>— Lin Mei</p>
<p>Seeing other people have jobs, I am very envious and also want to find one for myself. But what kind of job is good? Female employees in government offices have always been referred to as "vases." The name "vase" has some insulting undertones. I am not envious. I am willing to use my intelligence and physical strength to earn the compensation I deserve because I also know that regardless of whether it is mental or physical labor, it is still labor, and labor is sacred.</p>
<p>I wanted to find a job, and I finally found one. I work as a copyist in the manager's office of a certain company. The manager also treats me quite favorably, so I am exceptionally happy. However, after working for more than a month, I realized that I had been fooled.</p>
<p>The story is like this: one day, someone introduced a female employee. This female employee was very plainly dressed, with a slightly pale complexion and a few pockmarks. However, her demeanor was natural and generous, and her conversation was also very elegant. It was said that she had graduated from a university with a degree in commerce. This is a talented person who should have been hired as a matter of course, as there are several female employees with only a primary or secondary school education in our company. However, unexpectedly, she did not win the favor of the manager.</p>
<p>I was very strange and therefore studied it carefully. It turns out that the manager's standard for hiring female employees is still based on the word "appearance." Therefore, the female employees in our company are mostly young and beautiful, without dark faces or pockmarks, and without old women with chicken skin and white hair. No wonder that new female employee with pockmarks was not hired. Isn't the manager using our faces to make money for him? I understood this and couldn't help but feel endless sadness. It turns out that my position was obtained by relying on my youth and beautiful face. If, after ten or twenty years, wouldn't I still be unemployed? Am I still not a "vase"?</p>
<p>I feel insulted, but how can I avoid being insulted?</p>

<h3>Talking About Troupe Performance Drama</h3>
<p>— Song</p>
<p>Recently, cooperative performances have been popular. In Shanghai and Beijing, famous actors are gathered to perform their signature plays to attract audiences. In fact, this is a derivative of the charity performances and guild performances in Beiping. Tracing back to its origin, it actually started with the troupe performance dramas of various subjects in imperial examinations. In the past, the rules for opera troupes were extremely strict. Actors from one troupe could never perform in another troupe. However, in troupe performances, actors from various troupes could be gathered, and those who never collaborated could collaborate. In addition to the troupe performances of various subjects, the most prominent was the Grand Council of the Military Affairs Department. Every year on the second day of the New Year, it was held once. In the year of Ji Mao, the fifth year of Guangxu, I accompanied my father to the capital. The following year, the troupe performance in the year of Geng Chen was undertaken by my late father. At that time, Grand Secretary Zhang Ziqing, a minister of the court, was most fond of drama, so the performances were always very popular. The fortunes of the various subjects of the imperial examination had their ups and downs. Those with prosperous fortunes held independent performances, while those with declining fortunes combined two or three subjects. For example, my late father's Dao Guang Yi You subject and my elder brother's Tongzhi Geng Wu subject were both the most prosperous subjects. The location of the troupe performances was always in Caisheng Hall or Wenchang Hall. In the middle of Guangxu, it was in Huguang Hall. During the Guangxu and Xuantong periods, it was in Jiangxi Hall. After the imperial examinations were abolished, charity guild performances rose one after another. The period from the early Republic of China to before the 17th year was the era of extreme prosperity. However, troupe performances can be divided into a stage from the beginning of Guangxu to Wu Xu. At that time, Yang Yuelou, the father of Xiao Lou, Yu Ziyun, the father of Shu Yan, and Yang Guiyun, the grandfather of Baozhong and Baosen, were all the best of their time. Each time, there must be Kunqu performances. Shi Xiaofu, the father of Hui Bao, and Zhu Lianfen, the father of You Fen, were the leaders in this field. There must also be famous amateurs guest starring. The most famous were Chen Zifang and Wei Yaoqing. In Peking opera, Yuelou's "Changban Slope" was completely different from Xiao Lou's. His monkey plays were the best with "Water Curtain Cave." Ziyun and Xiaofu always performed "Yu Tang Chun," "Cai Lou Pei," "Sacrificing to the River," "Sacrificing to the Pagoda," or "Pu Fan." The play "Pu Guan" was highly valued because it required two bearded actors to perform together. When Yang performed, Ju Xian and Long Changsheng must collaborate. In Kunqu, Zhu always played the Go board. In Peking opera, Chen and Wei always performed the first two acts of "Rainbow Pass." Wei Yaoqing had the nickname "Wei the Life Taker" because his charm was even more seductive than that of Xun Huisheng and others. When troupe performances recruited famous actors, no one dared not to participate because if they didn't, the South City neighborhood had the possibility of arresting the leading actor, which was also a brutal policy of the feudal era.

<h3>Madame Lotus Stamen</h3>
<p>— Guo Hua</p>
<p>"Madame Lotus Stamen," which is showing at "Du Mei," is a Soviet film. Unlike most Soviet films, it has absolutely no propaganda undertones. Although at the beginning of the story, three storytellers said, "There is truth in this," the film did not emphasize the so-called truth in a way that made people uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The story is a fairy tale, or rather a folk tale. It tells the story of three sons who marry wives. The youngest son marries a frog, which turns out to be a beautiful woman. There are snake spirits, enchantresses, and spider spirits, as well as a dragon-slaying sword, which together make for an interesting story. Just for the sake of the story itself, parents can take their little darlings to see it.</p>
<h3>Value of Cigarettes</h3>
<p>— Yuan Qinsun</p>
<p>Reports say that the German people do not trust the legal tender and use American cigarettes as the standard, vying to collect them. Each box is worth 1,200 marks, equivalent to 100 US dollars. If calculated in our country's legal tender, it would be 1.64 million, which is equivalent to 3.4 taels of gold. In China, each box of American cigarettes costs 3,000, which is only worth 40 US cents. Based on Shanghai's 4 million citizens, each person consuming one box per day would require 1.6 million US dollars. However, this is vastly different from Germany.</p>
<h3>Thought Can Maintain Youth, Part Two</h3>
<p>— Translated by Xue Qing</p>
<p>Do not confuse the youth you used to know with true youth. Because this can restore youth to those who are already old. In any case, as long as you don't think you're old, you won't age. If you try to avoid aging, you will be the first to age.</p>
<p>Now I am going to tell you the secret to maintaining youth: it is very simple, which is to pay more attention to your thoughts, keep them forever young and full of vitality, and don't let your thoughts stagnate. Times are constantly advancing, pay attention to your surroundings, and learn new things anytime, anywhere. In this way, you will always be young.</p>
<p>In addition, do not let your life be too monotonous. I often see two kinds of people with different personalities. The first kind of people pay close attention to their family and work, and at the same time constantly seek other interesting jobs. They read newspapers and magazines and choose hobbies that use both their hands and brains. The other kind of people, starting at the age of thirty-five, begin to fall into a rigid and comfortable mechanical life. Every day after work, they go home to rest, watch some comic strips or sports news after dinner, or listen to the radio before going to bed. His wife, in addition to managing the household and taking care of the children, only listens to flattering operas, reads convoluted love novels, and participates in bridge games for recreation. For these two types of people, the first type becomes younger with the increase of years, while the second type seems to have suffered a fatal injury. If his life does not change, he will appear old at the age of forty-five.</p>
<p>Don't worry about your age; it is still not too late to make your life more interesting. Don't say, "I'm too old, it's too late!" Remember that a fifty-year-old housewife with specialized experience eventually became an outstanding industrial designer. Another retired electrical engineer is now a highly paid ceramic artist. Among my clients, there is also an old lady in her seventies whose children said she should retire, but she successfully opened a bridal cooking training school.</p>
<p>Don't think you're too old to go back to school. Someone entered medical school at the age of seventy, and he is now a famous doctor. Another person entered law school at the age of seventy and is now a very active lawyer. A ninety-one-year-old woman from California entered university to study American history for recuperation. Another woman started painting at the age of seventy-seven and held a solo exhibition at the age of eighty. Today, although she is eighty-six years old, she is still living healthily. So it's not too late, you can still create a new career.</p>
<p>In short, anyone who lives a progressive life, regardless of age, will remain young as long as you are willing to do it carefully. So keeping your mind always awake and lively is the secret to eternal youth. (Translated from Reader's Digest, January 1947, "Your Mind Can Keep You Young")</p>
